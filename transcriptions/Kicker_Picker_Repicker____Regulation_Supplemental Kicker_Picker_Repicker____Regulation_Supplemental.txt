[00:56.150 --> 01:02.050]  Hello, and welcome to the kicker, picker, re-picker, draft, pick, re-pick.
[01:02.450 --> 01:05.450]  You guys ready to get some new kickers?
[01:05.850 --> 01:06.330]  Are you?
[01:06.350 --> 01:06.730]  So ready.
[01:06.730 --> 01:08.290]  I'm so ready. I need some.
[01:08.990 --> 01:11.630]  Largely, I'm fine. I don't think we need to redraft these.
[01:11.630 --> 01:14.050]  Oh, no, no, no, no. We gotta do a swap-up.
[01:14.430 --> 01:16.630]  I wouldn't mind swapping a dude out.
[01:16.950 --> 01:17.830]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:17.930 --> 01:21.230]  I think some of us are fine with the team that we have, and we don't need to do that.
[01:21.230 --> 01:23.750]  So how many, how many are down a dude?
[01:24.570 --> 01:26.490]  Well, let's go through right now. Let's open Nick.
[01:27.030 --> 01:30.090]  Okay, let's have a look at Nick, who's at the bottom with 215.
[01:30.650 --> 01:31.730]  Yeah, having a good time here.
[01:33.470 --> 01:34.510]  Yeah, well, Lucas...
[01:35.630 --> 01:37.230]  Here's one guy who's just released.
[01:37.450 --> 01:38.290]  Yep, he's gone.
[01:39.850 --> 01:43.910]  The New York Giants kicker, Graham, Graham Gano, Graham Gano, whatever.
[01:44.590 --> 01:47.710]  I don't think he's, is he playing anymore?
[01:47.930 --> 01:48.830]  I think he's hurt.
[01:49.510 --> 01:51.270]  Okay, yeah, me too.
[01:52.910 --> 01:58.950]  Nick, at a minimum, needs two, but then also could probably use three because...
[01:58.950 --> 02:00.350]  Oh yeah, Matt Prater is also hurt.
[02:00.750 --> 02:05.310]  Yeah, so half of Nick's team is maybe out, potentially.
[02:06.630 --> 02:07.390]  That's tough.
[02:07.950 --> 02:09.870]  Dangerous business being a kicker in 2024.
[02:10.270 --> 02:15.530]  Yep, however, Andrew is also in a similar boat where he's gone.
[02:16.030 --> 02:16.770]  He's released.
[02:16.770 --> 02:19.150]  And Jake Moody is hurt as well.
[02:19.610 --> 02:20.190]  That's tough.
[02:20.770 --> 02:22.230]  Yeah, that's really tough.
[02:22.390 --> 02:22.610]  Rough.
[02:22.670 --> 02:24.030]  At least he got you some points.
[02:24.210 --> 02:24.350]  Yeah.
[02:24.610 --> 02:25.050]  That's true.
[02:25.710 --> 02:26.470]  Gavin, you got...
[02:28.470 --> 02:29.030]  Oh, shit.
[02:29.030 --> 02:31.130]  This is saying your Green Bay kicker is released.
[02:31.890 --> 02:32.730]  Yeah, he's gone.
[02:33.230 --> 02:36.410]  And I think this guy's racist, but I don't know if that matters to you very much.
[02:36.410 --> 02:38.470]  He hates women. I don't know if he's racist.
[02:38.470 --> 02:43.730]  Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Honestly, let me be the first to apologize, guys.
[02:43.730 --> 02:47.650]  When I said that I thought he was racist, I thought he was racist.
[02:47.870 --> 02:49.150]  I forgot he hates women.
[02:49.410 --> 02:52.330]  That's the thing to know about the kicker from Kansas City.
[02:52.630 --> 02:55.190]  Which is, to be fair, why Gavin picked him.
[02:58.910 --> 03:00.550]  Having a Chicago shootout.
[03:03.730 --> 03:05.810]  Jeff, you're in second place, 295.
[03:06.390 --> 03:07.530]  You're sitting pretty, man.
[03:07.890 --> 03:09.190]  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
[03:09.190 --> 03:12.650]  I wouldn't mind trading up on old Jake Elliott, who's a great kicker, by the way.
[03:12.650 --> 03:15.390]  He just doesn't get a lot of opportunity to kick in Philadelphia.
[03:15.950 --> 03:21.610]  Meanwhile, I'm feeling pretty good about my...
[03:21.610 --> 03:25.090]  Like, we got low performers here, but they're still getting me there.
[03:25.270 --> 03:29.290]  Really, I'm riding Dallas here because...
[03:29.290 --> 03:30.150]  No, you're riding Houston.
[03:30.710 --> 03:32.190]  Oh, look at this.
[03:32.930 --> 03:36.690]  You got horses. You got kicking horses.
[03:37.230 --> 03:42.350]  I got two strong Texas performers here, and I'm feeling really good about that.
[03:42.350 --> 03:43.590]  You got them donkey boys.
[03:44.010 --> 03:45.470]  You just got the big legs.
[03:45.810 --> 03:49.090]  You fucking know the donkey boys mount up.
[03:50.410 --> 03:52.250]  What's ex-perman-fugum?
[03:53.270 --> 03:53.390]  Huh?
[03:53.950 --> 03:55.270]  This is the extra point.
[03:55.610 --> 03:57.430]  Extra points made, field goals made.
[03:58.030 --> 04:00.890]  Field goals worth three points, an extra point is worth one.
[04:01.210 --> 04:02.930]  Yeah, but then they also have it...
[04:04.110 --> 04:08.150]  Here's how it would stand if it wasn't field goals is three.
[04:08.250 --> 04:09.470]  Oh, I like that much better.
[04:10.910 --> 04:11.310]  Uh...
[04:12.450 --> 04:14.250]  Nick's still at the bottom.
[04:14.590 --> 04:15.770]  Yeah, man, we should do that.
[04:15.910 --> 04:16.430]  Yeah, get rich.
[04:16.450 --> 04:17.550]  That's how math works.
[04:19.070 --> 04:23.050]  Listen, I picked Dallas knowing that they're never going to score in the end zone.
[04:23.210 --> 04:24.270]  They'll just have to kick...
[04:24.270 --> 04:25.370]  They'll have to settle for field goals.
[04:26.070 --> 04:29.990]  So the other drop down is just like how many balls went over the...
[04:29.990 --> 04:32.690]  Yes, yeah, everything just counts as one here.
[04:32.710 --> 04:32.890]  Okay.
[04:32.970 --> 04:34.830]  Yeah, yeah, which is not how I drafted.
[04:34.930 --> 04:37.690]  I drafted knowing that field goals were going to be worth more.
[04:37.950 --> 04:38.490]  Right, same.
[04:38.490 --> 04:39.150]  Yeah.
[04:42.330 --> 04:44.950]  You're in a better position if everything's just one.
[04:46.330 --> 04:47.410]  Am I not in the same?
[04:47.750 --> 04:48.470]  Oh, no, because I'm third.
[04:56.470 --> 04:57.510]  So, Andrew...
[04:57.510 --> 04:57.530]  Yes.
[04:58.030 --> 05:00.190]  So, shall we get to the reshuffling?
[05:00.790 --> 05:03.730]  Uh, I think the first thing we do...
[05:03.730 --> 05:06.490]  I think everyone has to drop a kicker from their team.
[05:07.470 --> 05:11.370]  And if your people are hurt, you can just drop them as well.
[05:11.670 --> 05:13.350]  So I think Nick can drop three people.
[05:14.610 --> 05:15.870]  Would be the way to do it.
[05:15.990 --> 05:18.950]  And Jeff and Eric, even though you guys are doing great,
[05:19.090 --> 05:22.750]  you're still going to have to drop at least one person to go into the pool.
[05:23.070 --> 05:25.730]  Now, let me propose this instead.
[05:25.870 --> 05:26.110]  Okay.
[05:26.510 --> 05:27.590]  I don't want to.
[05:27.910 --> 05:28.730]  Oh, that's too bad.
[05:28.970 --> 05:29.770]  That's unfortunate.
[05:30.330 --> 05:30.790]  That sucks.
[05:31.310 --> 05:32.310]  That sucks for you, dude.
[05:32.970 --> 05:33.370]  Well...
[05:33.370 --> 05:34.510]  Drop Brandon Albrey.
[05:35.790 --> 05:36.230]  No!
[05:36.710 --> 05:38.610]  So whoever they drop, can I pick?
[05:39.630 --> 05:40.070]  Potentially.
[05:40.710 --> 05:41.150]  Potentially.
[05:41.670 --> 05:45.890]  Now, how are we going to do that, Andrew?
[05:46.210 --> 05:49.010]  Like, are we looking at, like, putting everything in a pool or what?
[05:49.170 --> 05:50.510]  Yeah, let's add...
[05:50.510 --> 05:51.370]  So there is a...
[05:51.370 --> 05:54.790]  If you scroll to the bottom of the dock that you're on, we have a...
[05:54.790 --> 05:55.230]  A kicker-re-picker.
[05:55.550 --> 05:58.070]  Kicker-re-picker section.
[06:00.130 --> 06:01.010]  Maybe whoever...
[06:01.010 --> 06:02.810]  Now, it won't be, like, fancy.
[06:03.510 --> 06:05.370]  These are replacements and dregs.
[06:06.150 --> 06:06.550]  Yes.
[06:08.130 --> 06:15.030]  But maybe we put the non-injured drop players into this, and then they become draft eligible,
[06:15.410 --> 06:18.190]  and we'll just mark whoever takes them if they do.
[06:18.810 --> 06:19.330]  And I'll...
[06:19.330 --> 06:21.170]  I mean, I guess I'll just have to copy...
[06:21.170 --> 06:22.370]  I'm not really sure how this is built.
[06:22.570 --> 06:25.990]  I guess I'll just copy and paste these elements down into, like, this thing.
[06:26.250 --> 06:26.950]  I have no idea.
[06:27.530 --> 06:29.470]  Also, this is all fucked up.
[06:29.550 --> 06:30.210]  What the fuck?
[06:30.610 --> 06:31.450]  This is all...
[06:32.110 --> 06:32.510]  Listen.
[06:33.510 --> 06:33.910]  Yeah.
[06:34.350 --> 06:34.610]  What?
[06:34.970 --> 06:35.510]  Yeah, go ahead.
[06:36.010 --> 06:36.410]  Listen.
[06:36.650 --> 06:37.030]  I'm...
[06:37.030 --> 06:37.450]  Yeah, I...
[06:37.450 --> 06:38.930]  Yeah, no, you already said listen.
[06:39.190 --> 06:40.850]  Now, you go to the part where you tell me.
[06:41.330 --> 06:41.790]  Stretch out these.
[06:42.770 --> 06:42.970]  Yeah.
[06:43.130 --> 06:44.150]  I don't know that...
[06:44.150 --> 06:44.750]  I think is...
[06:44.750 --> 06:46.630]  Isn't that going to move everything around?
[06:47.370 --> 06:47.730]  Just...
[06:47.730 --> 06:48.370]  You know what you could do?
[06:48.550 --> 06:53.330]  You can copy 42, the line, and just paste it several times underneath it.
[06:54.210 --> 06:55.130]  Oh, I can.
[06:55.330 --> 06:56.250]  Oh, this is so good.
[06:57.450 --> 06:59.850]  Now, Andrew said listen, and I'm still waiting.
[07:00.430 --> 07:01.130]  Good job.
[07:01.130 --> 07:02.630]  He was saying, listen, Nick's got it.
[07:02.830 --> 07:04.190]  Yeah, exactly.
[07:04.490 --> 07:06.690]  Nick took the words out of...
[07:06.690 --> 07:09.470]  Team No Bad Ideas fully showing their force here.
[07:09.610 --> 07:10.250]  All right, all right.
[07:10.690 --> 07:12.330]  Team Tape needs to fucking get it together.
[07:12.990 --> 07:13.810]  Showing their foreskin?
[07:14.990 --> 07:15.990]  Yeah, I heard that too.
[07:16.150 --> 07:16.370]  Really?
[07:17.610 --> 07:18.850]  I did not hear that.
[07:19.170 --> 07:19.870]  No, me neither.
[07:20.050 --> 07:23.090]  And also, I feel like if Jeff heard that, he would have been the first one to call it out.
[07:23.610 --> 07:24.690]  And I'll be honest with you.
[07:24.710 --> 07:29.150]  I'm listening for foreskin talk, so it would have stood out to me.
[07:29.610 --> 07:31.390]  Jeff has an alarm in his office.
[07:31.570 --> 07:32.810]  It goes off.
[07:33.110 --> 07:35.930]  I've always got an ear out for foreskin talk.
[07:36.050 --> 07:38.930]  It's like how you can set Google alerts for specific searches.
[07:39.410 --> 07:39.650]  Yeah.
[07:41.830 --> 07:42.790]  Let's do this.
[07:43.170 --> 07:43.870]  Let's do this.
[07:44.330 --> 07:47.950]  Let's start at the top for who we're giving up, and we can start listing them.
[07:48.050 --> 07:49.230]  I'll start listing them down.
[07:49.670 --> 07:53.490]  You tell me the team and the player, and that's how we'll do this.
[07:53.550 --> 07:54.890]  This is how we'll know who we're giving up.
[07:55.290 --> 07:55.850]  I'll go first.
[07:56.050 --> 07:56.630]  You go first, yeah.
[07:56.630 --> 07:59.350]  Since I'm at the top, and I will say...
[08:01.550 --> 08:07.590]  Miami Dolphins kicker Jason Saunders has been released from my team.
[08:07.610 --> 08:08.190]  Oh my god.
[08:08.190 --> 08:11.250]  It didn't keep the formatting for any of this.
[08:11.570 --> 08:12.010]  That's okay.
[08:12.550 --> 08:12.870]  Great.
[08:13.170 --> 08:13.450]  Anyway.
[08:14.550 --> 08:15.970]  Okay, that's my release.
[08:16.150 --> 08:17.150]  I don't want to.
[08:17.450 --> 08:23.210]  He's just technically my lowest performing kicker, even though I should probably release
[08:23.210 --> 08:24.910]  my Bears kicker, because they're fucking bad.
[08:25.010 --> 08:26.470]  But, you know, it is what it is.
[08:27.110 --> 08:28.390]  Now, second place.
[08:28.590 --> 08:31.190]  Jeff, you are releasing who?
[08:31.430 --> 08:32.890]  One player that I'm...
[08:33.530 --> 08:37.330]  It's mandatory that I release a kicker.
[08:37.690 --> 08:40.530]  I'm not doing it because I want to, so I'm just going to look at hard numbers.
[08:40.990 --> 08:46.510]  It's not an indictment on his worth in my eyes, but I'm going to let go of Jake Elliott
[08:46.510 --> 08:47.890]  of the Philadelphia Eagles.
[08:48.150 --> 08:48.630]  There it is.
[08:48.730 --> 08:49.210]  Jake Elliott.
[08:49.650 --> 08:51.390]  Jake Elliott, you've been kicked.
[08:51.810 --> 08:52.510]  That's pretty good.
[08:52.690 --> 08:53.030]  I like that.
[08:53.050 --> 08:53.690]  Oh, that's really good.
[08:53.910 --> 08:54.310]  Yeah, right?
[08:54.390 --> 08:55.010]  I'm pretty...
[08:55.010 --> 08:56.410]  Honestly, I've been...
[08:56.470 --> 08:58.570]  I've been pretty on fire with...
[08:58.570 --> 08:58.690]  You are.
[08:58.970 --> 09:00.870]  ...specifically the kicker picker with names.
[09:01.770 --> 09:05.950]  Next, Gavin, who will you be releasing to the pool?
[09:06.230 --> 09:06.810]  And why?
[09:07.990 --> 09:09.050]  How many am I releasing?
[09:09.950 --> 09:11.850]  You have to release at least one.
[09:12.670 --> 09:16.450]  Well, I want to release the one that's gone or something.
[09:16.810 --> 09:17.390]  Okay, yeah.
[09:17.550 --> 09:19.190]  Okay, and who is that?
[09:19.590 --> 09:20.410]  Here you go, Gavin.
[09:20.730 --> 09:21.730]  I just linked it to you.
[09:21.730 --> 09:22.950]  Go take a look.
[09:27.230 --> 09:27.950]  Visit site.
[09:31.810 --> 09:34.350]  Before this started, Jeff said,
[09:34.450 --> 09:35.790]  did we all do our kicker picker homework?
[09:35.970 --> 09:36.730]  And I said, absolutely.
[09:37.030 --> 09:38.410]  Gavin, you know Gavin's locked in.
[09:38.810 --> 09:39.490]  Wait, that was homework?
[09:40.310 --> 09:42.590]  Well, you want to know what you're walking into.
[09:42.790 --> 09:45.590]  So I looked at how all the kickers are doing and who I would want to switch out.
[09:45.730 --> 09:45.870]  Oh, big time.
[09:46.170 --> 09:46.650]  Oh yeah, you do.
[09:46.930 --> 09:47.530]  Made a list.
[09:47.610 --> 09:50.690]  I'm going to boot out Bray Naveas.
[09:50.690 --> 09:51.590]  Okay, okay.
[09:51.590 --> 09:53.490]  And what team is he on, Gavin?
[09:55.510 --> 09:56.550]  G... GB?
[09:56.950 --> 09:57.230]  What's that?
[09:57.410 --> 09:58.150]  And who's that?
[09:58.550 --> 09:59.470]  Giant Balls.
[09:59.510 --> 10:00.450]  Okay, there you go.
[10:00.510 --> 10:00.710]  All right.
[10:01.170 --> 10:01.690]  Peckers.
[10:02.430 --> 10:06.370]  Technically, he was released from the Giant Balls, on what Gavin is saying.
[10:06.890 --> 10:13.750]  I would also, for all the women out there, I want to release Butka.
[10:13.970 --> 10:14.370]  Wow.
[10:15.390 --> 10:15.530]  Yeah.
[10:16.590 --> 10:17.110]  Wow.
[10:17.730 --> 10:18.110]  Wow.
[10:19.030 --> 10:21.950]  That's a big move for you because that is, um...
[10:21.950 --> 10:23.750]  That's the Gavin free apology tour.
[10:26.510 --> 10:28.330]  He's a top three kicker for you, man.
[10:28.570 --> 10:31.550]  And Nick's going to snatch that guy up like no problem.
[10:32.130 --> 10:33.510]  You think he's going to get snatched up?
[10:33.670 --> 10:36.870]  Oh, dude, we don't call a misogynic for nothing.
[10:37.390 --> 10:38.590]  What the fuck?
[10:41.730 --> 10:43.170]  We have to be careful.
[10:43.610 --> 10:44.990]  Nick's not going to play anymore.
[10:45.670 --> 10:47.410]  I can't even consider this now.
[10:47.410 --> 10:48.550]  This is ridiculous.
[10:48.550 --> 10:50.410]  I wanted to win and now I don't care.
[10:51.130 --> 10:55.130]  Sorry, I should refer to you as your other nickname, Milfslayer.
[10:57.430 --> 11:00.970]  I think last time we said that, he went, don't tell my wife.
[11:02.950 --> 11:04.870]  Yeah, I probably whispered it to you.
[11:05.110 --> 11:06.590]  Is that why he's been playing The Last of Us?
[11:07.230 --> 11:07.990]  Oh my god.
[11:09.830 --> 11:11.450]  Andrew, it's on to you.
[11:11.970 --> 11:13.010]  What are you thinking?
[11:13.350 --> 11:14.690]  How, like, what are you doing?
[11:14.690 --> 11:19.350]  Taking Cade York to the curb like Washington did in week one.
[11:19.930 --> 11:20.950]  Get them out of here.
[11:21.050 --> 11:22.350]  I still believe in Jake Moody.
[11:22.470 --> 11:24.170]  I think he'll be back even though he's hurt now.
[11:24.730 --> 11:26.650]  I'm keeping Jake Moody.
[11:27.070 --> 11:28.590]  So that's the only drop I'm doing.
[11:28.590 --> 11:35.170]  You have a really strong group besides Cade York.
[11:37.590 --> 11:40.130]  Everyone is, like, really strong there.
[11:40.230 --> 11:43.930]  You could definitely get to the top of the board if you have someone strong for your pick.
[11:43.930 --> 11:44.930]  I think so.
[11:46.030 --> 11:47.370]  Um, and finally...
[11:48.310 --> 11:48.750]  What's up?
[11:49.350 --> 11:53.250]  Nick, who are you releasing?
[11:54.270 --> 11:55.670]  We'll go one by one.
[11:56.070 --> 11:59.310]  Yeah, so, uh, you might not just...
[11:59.310 --> 12:00.390]  Don't even put these on the board.
[12:00.450 --> 12:00.890]  It doesn't matter.
[12:01.010 --> 12:04.210]  So I'm gonna drop Lucas Havariscic.
[12:04.890 --> 12:06.430]  And what team is that?
[12:06.770 --> 12:07.410]  That's Cleveland.
[12:07.790 --> 12:08.050]  Okay.
[12:09.510 --> 12:09.930]  Okay.
[12:09.930 --> 12:15.870]  And then, uh, I'd like to follow that up with, uh, one, uh, Arizona's Matt Prater.
[12:17.350 --> 12:17.990]  He's old.
[12:18.810 --> 12:21.110]  Followed by the Giants' Graham Gano.
[12:22.690 --> 12:25.150]  God, your other kickers are all really good, too.
[12:25.530 --> 12:26.390]  They're excellent.
[12:26.670 --> 12:26.870]  Yep.
[12:28.130 --> 12:28.610]  Yep.
[12:29.650 --> 12:30.510]  Oh my god.
[12:31.210 --> 12:31.690]  Okay.
[12:31.910 --> 12:33.090]  Maybe I'll have a shot now.
[12:33.090 --> 12:34.530]  Now, now, here's the thing.
[12:35.270 --> 12:41.790]  Everyone is sort of off kilter now, because I only released one.
[12:42.030 --> 12:44.010]  I believe Jeff only released one.
[12:46.170 --> 12:47.090]  What, Nick?
[12:47.350 --> 12:48.950]  You only released one, Andrew?
[12:49.330 --> 12:50.210]  I did, yes.
[12:50.730 --> 12:52.690]  And Gavin released two.
[12:52.830 --> 12:53.010]  Two.
[12:53.590 --> 12:54.890]  Should I just release one, then?
[12:54.970 --> 12:55.710]  Nick released three.
[12:55.710 --> 12:56.270]  No, that's fine.
[12:56.270 --> 12:59.110]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:59.110 --> 13:02.530]  Um, you haven't having second thoughts about releasing the, uh, misogynists, huh?
[13:03.050 --> 13:05.510]  No, no, I was going to take the, uh, the one that's gone back.
[13:06.330 --> 13:06.650]  Uh.
[13:12.030 --> 13:15.610]  So this is, we're gonna, we're now in the reacquiring phase.
[13:15.830 --> 13:18.170]  The, the picker, the re-picker of the picker.
[13:18.470 --> 13:19.170]  How do we pick?
[13:19.270 --> 13:20.210]  Pick who picks first.
[13:20.370 --> 13:23.510]  Now this, well, I think it should go to Nick first, because he's last.
[13:23.650 --> 13:25.870]  However, let's do a little spicy wrinkle.
[13:26.570 --> 13:27.650]  Eric, could you pull up the wheel?
[13:28.190 --> 13:29.050]  Why, I can't, Andrew.
[13:29.150 --> 13:30.770]  I think the wheel sounds like a great idea.
[13:30.770 --> 13:36.990]  Could you put, uh, let's do two steals, two skips, if you may.
[13:37.170 --> 13:39.510]  So I just, you want me to write steal?
[13:39.590 --> 13:42.030]  And then steal, and then skip and skip.
[13:42.190 --> 13:45.150]  And then skip, and then skip.
[13:45.530 --> 13:46.050]  Okay.
[13:47.010 --> 13:47.590]  Now, Nick?
[13:47.850 --> 13:50.170]  Still chained together is the image in the middle.
[13:50.390 --> 13:51.170]  That's pretty exciting.
[13:51.470 --> 13:52.330]  Fantastic. I love it.
[13:52.330 --> 13:55.930]  That's pretty cool. I think that's pretty cool.
[13:58.190 --> 13:59.970]  Now, I, what would be fair?
[13:59.970 --> 14:03.150]  We all get one spin at the wheel if we want to take it.
[14:03.190 --> 14:05.270]  Would that be mechanically the way to do this?
[14:05.490 --> 14:11.830]  Would it be more fair just to put three Nicks, two Gavins, one Jeff, one Eric, and one Andrew,
[14:11.990 --> 14:13.170]  and then you just spin it?
[14:13.750 --> 14:14.050]  Yeah.
[14:14.430 --> 14:15.770]  Why would that be more fair?
[14:16.250 --> 14:17.290]  Because then it's just random.
[14:17.670 --> 14:20.370]  But Nick has a greater chance, and Gavin has a greater chance,
[14:20.370 --> 14:22.270]  because it's weighted more in their favor.
[14:23.270 --> 14:24.390]  Kind of like an NBA draft.
[14:24.690 --> 14:26.090]  But you don't have to spin the wheel.
[14:26.470 --> 14:27.410]  The wheel is optional.
[14:27.410 --> 14:30.630]  Yeah, it's just a, it's just a way to randomize who gets it.
[14:30.870 --> 14:32.030]  What does the wheel do?
[14:32.730 --> 14:35.350]  So the wheel, the idea of the wheel is that if Nick wants,
[14:35.370 --> 14:38.410]  he can attempt to steal a player from any team.
[14:40.110 --> 14:44.590]  Or, uh-huh, if it lands on Skip, he loses his turn.
[14:44.790 --> 14:45.730]  And it goes to the next person.
[14:45.730 --> 14:48.730]  So what's, so what's happened here is that there's a mechanic
[14:48.730 --> 14:51.450]  that Andrew has come up with that he has not told us about.
[14:51.590 --> 14:53.210]  And it involves stealing.
[14:53.210 --> 14:56.270]  To be fair, I was explaining it,
[14:56.330 --> 14:58.790]  and then we detoured into how to optimize the wheel
[14:58.790 --> 15:01.250]  while I was explaining the mechanics of it.
[15:01.330 --> 15:03.170]  I thought we were just trying to pick who's gonna go,
[15:03.250 --> 15:04.590]  like what order we go in.
[15:04.650 --> 15:08.150]  No, we're going from bottom to top, because Nick is in dead last.
[15:08.210 --> 15:10.890]  So I think you should have first chance at the pool.
[15:11.650 --> 15:12.350]  At the bottom.
[15:12.410 --> 15:15.830]  Can I just have it without any kind of, you know, penalty?
[15:16.210 --> 15:17.450]  Just let me have one.
[15:17.850 --> 15:21.330]  Well, it's your, I think you have to decide if you want to gamble
[15:21.330 --> 15:26.230]  by taking any player available or going with the pool
[15:26.230 --> 15:29.110]  and then setting a limit to how many times we can spin.
[15:29.310 --> 15:31.310]  So that way you can't just spin every time.
[15:31.950 --> 15:33.970]  Yeah, this makes way more sense than the other way.
[15:34.490 --> 15:36.770]  Well, you're solving a different problem, Jeff.
[15:36.950 --> 15:40.070]  This is that you're giving a solution for a different thing.
[15:40.650 --> 15:41.750]  I, yeah, I guess.
[15:41.890 --> 15:44.930]  But so people are going to steal the people already on my team?
[15:45.270 --> 15:45.930]  Yeah, if they want.
[15:46.150 --> 15:50.010]  This changes, this changes the entirety of the whole point of the kicker picker.
[15:50.010 --> 15:52.530]  Now, it's not who you think is the best choice.
[15:52.870 --> 15:56.710]  It's like if you got lucky and can steal from somebody else like that,
[15:56.770 --> 15:57.710]  that's a totally different game.
[15:57.870 --> 15:59.130]  Well, then throw away the wheel.
[15:59.190 --> 16:00.190]  Now it's the kicker knicker.
[16:02.550 --> 16:04.110]  So should we do?
[16:04.510 --> 16:07.890]  I'm not saying I'm not saying we can't do it or I'm opposed to it.
[16:07.950 --> 16:11.070]  It's just a huge curveball to throw at us halfway through the season.
[16:11.390 --> 16:15.210]  It's well, listen, huge curveball for Nick losing three of his guys.
[16:15.330 --> 16:15.910]  Curves happen.
[16:16.290 --> 16:17.270]  Sports are unpredictable.
[16:17.830 --> 16:19.230]  You don't know what's going to happen left or right.
[16:19.230 --> 16:21.870]  Gavin doesn't even know the rules to the fucking game he's picking for.
[16:22.210 --> 16:25.450]  Yeah, but can teams actually steal a player?
[16:25.850 --> 16:26.550]  Oh, it's called no.
[16:26.710 --> 16:28.110]  No, you can't steal a player.
[16:28.290 --> 16:29.390]  But this isn't the NFL.
[16:29.730 --> 16:31.750]  Also, just to clarify.
[16:32.610 --> 16:33.150]  What is this?
[16:33.470 --> 16:35.030]  This is the kicker picker re-picker.
[16:38.550 --> 16:41.290]  Sorry, I went into this thinking it was the NFL.
[16:41.470 --> 16:42.130]  That's my mistake.
[16:42.230 --> 16:43.230]  Listen, I did the same.
[16:43.610 --> 16:44.890]  I just learned last week.
[16:45.030 --> 16:46.310]  It's been a wild card.
[16:47.430 --> 16:50.430]  Eric, can you put two more steals and two more skips on the wheel?
[16:50.730 --> 16:51.710]  Now, why is that?
[16:52.670 --> 16:53.070]  Aesthetics.
[16:53.690 --> 16:54.750]  You just want to see it?
[16:56.170 --> 16:57.190]  Does that look cool?
[16:57.990 --> 16:58.690]  Really cool.
[16:59.190 --> 17:03.750]  Now, if we think that this ruins the integrity of the kicker picker as a whole, I'm fine with
[17:04.490 --> 17:05.470]  throwing it away.
[17:06.430 --> 17:08.690]  Well, the guy that doesn't know anything has a lot of opinions.
[17:11.190 --> 17:15.250]  Or I was just trying to think of a fun way to spice it up middle of the season
[17:15.250 --> 17:17.650]  because the pool kind of sucks.
[17:18.370 --> 17:19.830]  The re-pick pool.
[17:20.430 --> 17:26.050]  So the idea of the re-pick in the middle was to give teams at the bottom a chance to reclaim
[17:26.050 --> 17:27.370]  at the top.
[17:27.710 --> 17:30.270]  So I was trying to think of a fun way to do it.
[17:30.350 --> 17:33.050]  If anyone has any other suggestions, completely open to it.
[17:33.070 --> 17:34.090]  We don't have to do this.
[17:34.690 --> 17:37.570]  As it's floating at a wheel, because I love to spin a wheel.
[17:38.930 --> 17:42.250]  Yeah, I thought the wheel made a lot of sense to decide who picks next.
[17:42.250 --> 17:46.610]  I don't think that makes any sense in this context of the pool is shallow.
[17:46.930 --> 17:48.890]  So what if Eric goes first?
[17:49.270 --> 17:50.490]  Then I would love that.
[17:50.550 --> 17:51.770]  I think that's fantastic.
[17:52.270 --> 17:55.810]  That he would have nailed a one in because Nick has three names on the wheel.
[17:55.810 --> 17:59.490]  I mean, how do you think the Detroit Pistons feel about getting the fourth pick of the draft
[17:59.490 --> 18:01.730]  every fucking year when they could just as easily get the first?
[18:01.790 --> 18:03.550]  But that's just that's just chance.
[18:03.630 --> 18:04.410]  That's how it works.
[18:04.850 --> 18:06.090]  Yeah, I'm the Detroit Pistons.
[18:06.830 --> 18:09.010]  Not in the NFL, though, which is what this is.
[18:09.190 --> 18:10.590]  The NFL is purely based on that.
[18:10.590 --> 18:12.450]  That's pretty clearly not the NFL.
[18:12.450 --> 18:14.210]  I think we all know that.
[18:14.430 --> 18:15.110]  This is the best.
[18:15.290 --> 18:15.950]  This is the best.
[18:17.250 --> 18:18.790]  Can I pick my guy now?
[18:19.090 --> 18:20.850]  I know we need to figure out what we're doing.
[18:21.170 --> 18:22.810]  You have to steal somebody from Andrew.
[18:24.850 --> 18:25.850]  I'm stepping back.
[18:26.010 --> 18:27.170]  We can get rid of the wheel.
[18:27.250 --> 18:28.210]  We don't have to use the wheel.
[18:28.370 --> 18:29.890]  I was just trying to add some spice to this.
[18:30.230 --> 18:30.970]  I love the wheel.
[18:31.070 --> 18:34.570]  I just thought what someone said about having Nick on the wheel three times, me twice.
[18:34.930 --> 18:36.070]  Okay, well, let's do that.
[18:36.910 --> 18:37.310]  Great.
[18:37.810 --> 18:39.050]  Let's do that.
[18:41.350 --> 18:41.990]  Nick, Nick.
[18:42.070 --> 18:42.810]  Oh, wait, hang on.
[18:44.490 --> 18:46.030]  Wait, we're all going to be side by side, though.
[18:46.230 --> 18:46.270]  Gavin.
[18:46.430 --> 18:46.950]  Oh, is that how?
[18:47.290 --> 18:48.290]  Oh, you're right.
[18:48.850 --> 18:49.810]  Well, you can shuffle after.
[18:50.010 --> 18:50.130]  Shuffle.
[18:50.130 --> 18:50.750]  Oh, yeah, you can.
[18:50.930 --> 18:53.530]  Oh, Gavin, you genius.
[18:53.910 --> 18:54.670]  Good, look at that.
[18:54.850 --> 18:55.170]  God.
[18:55.610 --> 18:55.930]  Jeff.
[18:56.450 --> 18:57.910]  But now Andrew's going to be mad.
[18:58.350 --> 18:59.370]  No, I'm good with it.
[18:59.830 --> 19:01.370]  I was just trying to add a suggestion.
[19:01.870 --> 19:04.610]  What if when it lands on you, it transitions to the second wheel?
[19:07.930 --> 19:09.910]  Consisting of steal and save or whatever.
[19:09.910 --> 19:16.070]  Like maybe like if it lands on you in this wheel, you have the choice of accepting that choice
[19:16.070 --> 19:18.690]  or you can flip to the other wheel.
[19:18.910 --> 19:19.930]  You can't put them on this wheel.
[19:19.930 --> 19:21.190]  I don't know what's happening now.
[19:21.430 --> 19:22.110]  Why not?
[19:22.410 --> 19:22.730]  Eric.
[19:22.990 --> 19:23.230]  Yeah.
[19:23.290 --> 19:24.150]  What are you doing?
[19:24.430 --> 19:25.810]  Yeah, just trying to spice it up.
[19:25.910 --> 19:28.030]  Mid-season re-picker, kicker, picker.
[19:28.090 --> 19:29.530]  We need two wheels now.
[19:31.410 --> 19:32.450]  I just...
[19:32.450 --> 19:33.570]  Is this our wheel era?
[19:34.130 --> 19:36.290]  What if it's steal, skip, or...
[19:36.290 --> 19:37.490]  Why does Gavin have two?
[19:37.990 --> 19:38.390]  Block.
[19:38.530 --> 19:39.190]  Because I got third.
[19:39.190 --> 19:40.710]  He gave up two guys.
[19:41.610 --> 19:42.890]  We'll just do Uno rules.
[19:44.190 --> 19:45.250]  Gavin gave up two guys.
[19:45.330 --> 19:45.790]  Wouldn't that be...
[19:46.390 --> 19:46.570]  Yeah.
[19:46.650 --> 19:48.290]  I thought it was based on standings.
[19:48.890 --> 19:50.810]  No, it's based on how many people you gave up.
[19:51.070 --> 19:51.830]  Based on holes.
[19:52.410 --> 19:53.970]  Yeah, he has two holes he has to fill.
[19:54.150 --> 19:54.390]  Okay.
[19:54.690 --> 19:54.950]  Okay.
[19:55.130 --> 19:58.770]  So then when it lands on somebody, we can remove them from the wheel and then spin again.
[19:59.110 --> 20:03.310]  If anyone would like to release another player to get more wheel space, I'd say go for it.
[20:03.370 --> 20:04.090]  No, it's too late.
[20:04.870 --> 20:05.230]  Okay.
[20:08.250 --> 20:09.670]  So do you want me to shuffle this?
[20:10.110 --> 20:10.230]  Yeah.
[20:12.210 --> 20:15.590]  Now, before we do it, Andrew, are you happy with this version or do you want the second
[20:15.590 --> 20:16.490]  wheel to come into play?
[20:17.030 --> 20:20.290]  I don't understand the second wheel, so I think I'm good with this.
[20:20.630 --> 20:21.190]  You created the second wheel.
[20:21.190 --> 20:22.610]  The second wheel is your wheel.
[20:23.990 --> 20:24.310]  Oh.
[20:25.430 --> 20:26.070]  Well, I'm fine.
[20:26.150 --> 20:27.030]  We don't have to do it.
[20:27.070 --> 20:30.370]  It seems like there was a lot of resistance to what I was saying, so I'm fine dropping it.
[20:30.370 --> 20:35.530]  What if it's the second wheel, but it's harder to get the steel?
[20:37.510 --> 20:38.150]  I don't care.
[20:38.770 --> 20:40.290]  Like steel would be one of four or something.
[20:40.290 --> 20:41.270]  I'm happy with whatever.
[20:41.610 --> 20:44.290]  I was just trying to add a fun wrinkle to the dumb game.
[20:44.470 --> 20:45.310]  I think it is fun.
[20:46.790 --> 20:48.930]  Not fun enough to be the wheel.
[20:49.390 --> 20:51.930]  It has to be a secondary maybe wheel.
[20:53.510 --> 20:54.850]  Wasn't it always a maybe wheel?
[20:56.230 --> 20:57.510]  Yeah, but now this is...
[20:57.510 --> 21:00.170]  No, we moved into a definitive wheel territory.
[21:00.890 --> 21:03.730]  And it was chosen not to be the definitive wheel.
[21:04.270 --> 21:05.330]  It could still be.
[21:05.450 --> 21:07.650]  All I've done is put a wheel before your wheel.
[21:08.530 --> 21:09.970]  I'm good with the second wheel.
[21:10.110 --> 21:12.110]  I just don't want to overcomplicate this.
[21:12.650 --> 21:14.710]  Oh, why would you want to do that?
[21:16.590 --> 21:20.830]  I'm known for being straightforward, clear.
[21:21.450 --> 21:28.590]  I'm so happy that for the last five to ten minutes, it's just been this wheel spinning
[21:28.590 --> 21:32.450]  in circles and there are people watching this and it's just it's just going.
[21:32.990 --> 21:33.990]  It's just going.
[21:34.430 --> 21:35.050]  This rocks.
[21:35.330 --> 21:36.130]  This is the best.
[21:36.310 --> 21:37.870]  So do we need a second wheel?
[21:38.210 --> 21:38.710]  Is that what we're doing?
[21:41.050 --> 21:43.250]  Tab a new wheel.
[21:43.730 --> 21:50.810]  I don't know if I can, but if this kept chained together, isn't it just going to...
[21:52.050 --> 21:54.570]  Oh, I'm putting a different browser with a VPN.
[21:55.050 --> 21:55.310]  No.
[21:56.870 --> 21:58.470]  Now, what's this wheel doing?
[21:59.410 --> 22:01.070]  Hang on, skip, skip.
[22:01.350 --> 22:01.730]  OK, cool.
[22:01.970 --> 22:02.130]  Good.
[22:02.810 --> 22:05.010]  Oh, I should also have a return to first wheel option.
[22:11.810 --> 22:16.050]  OK, so it's skip, skip, steal, steal, skip, steal.
[22:17.390 --> 22:19.530]  Should there also be like a block one?
[22:19.690 --> 22:21.250]  Like you could get a card to stop.
[22:21.790 --> 22:23.070]  Why would you block?
[22:24.070 --> 22:24.550]  Yeah.
[22:26.510 --> 22:28.090]  So you can't be stolen from.
[22:28.590 --> 22:29.570]  You could apply...
[22:29.570 --> 22:31.030]  Wait, why does it say block one?
[22:31.370 --> 22:33.410]  Oh, you want like a get out of jail free card?
[22:33.950 --> 22:34.930]  I was just thinking block.
[22:35.590 --> 22:37.830]  Yeah, you hold it like a get out of jail free card.
[22:37.830 --> 22:39.850]  I like it. I like it. I like it a lot. That's great.
[22:40.070 --> 22:43.250]  OK. Nick, are there any other things we should add here, Nick?
[22:44.450 --> 22:45.850]  Nick gets Eric's best kicker.
[22:45.970 --> 22:46.790]  Nah, I don't think so.
[22:47.470 --> 22:48.870]  I mean, that's what steal is for.
[22:49.990 --> 22:51.210]  Oh, yeah, that could be...
[22:51.210 --> 22:52.910]  OK, let's do this.
[22:53.950 --> 22:54.970]  Let's spin wheel one.
[22:55.430 --> 22:56.410]  Hang on, Nick said ooh.
[22:56.730 --> 22:57.230]  Go ahead, Nick.
[22:57.290 --> 22:57.690]  What's up?
[22:57.690 --> 22:59.610]  What about what about like a...
[22:59.610 --> 23:03.690]  What about like a chance spot where you have to leave one of your players on the board
[23:03.690 --> 23:04.870]  and whoever lands on it gets it?
[23:05.350 --> 23:06.430]  Oh, like a dropped...
[23:06.430 --> 23:07.030]  Like you just...
[23:07.030 --> 23:07.210]  Yeah.
[23:07.830 --> 23:08.190]  Yeah.
[23:08.790 --> 23:12.230]  So you just... you pick one of your guys that you have to drop onto that spot
[23:12.230 --> 23:13.670]  and whoever gets it next gets that player.
[23:13.690 --> 23:15.390]  So on the wheel, it would be forced drop.
[23:15.810 --> 23:16.350]  Forced drop.
[23:17.150 --> 23:19.170]  Ooh, what about lose a turn as well?
[23:19.950 --> 23:20.930]  Well, that's skip, isn't it?
[23:20.950 --> 23:21.390]  That's skip.
[23:23.410 --> 23:26.670]  Yeah, but lose a turn is like you lose your next turn.
[23:26.670 --> 23:31.070]  So you this is just you get skip this turn, but then you lose your next turn as well.
[23:31.210 --> 23:35.910]  So if you land on lose a turn, you have to spin the wheel again to determine the current turn.
[23:36.550 --> 23:37.990]  The next turn you don't go either.
[23:39.070 --> 23:41.890]  You've already fucked up this turn by landing on the wrong one.
[23:42.370 --> 23:42.750]  I see.
[23:42.810 --> 23:44.090]  It's like a double lose a turn.
[23:44.190 --> 23:44.330]  Yeah.
[23:44.810 --> 23:45.550]  Oh, yeah.
[23:45.610 --> 23:47.730]  And Eric, could you put half a car on one?
[23:47.770 --> 23:48.170]  Yeah.
[23:48.290 --> 23:48.970]  Force drop.
[23:49.910 --> 23:50.670]  Half a car.
[23:52.270 --> 23:53.850]  What's the what's the other thing?
[23:53.950 --> 23:54.590]  Lose a turn.
[23:56.670 --> 23:58.070]  It's like lose two points.
[23:58.530 --> 23:59.230]  Spin again.
[23:59.570 --> 24:00.710]  Okay, spin again.
[24:00.950 --> 24:01.630]  Oh, spin again.
[24:01.890 --> 24:02.470]  That's good.
[24:03.450 --> 24:05.010]  See, this is what I like.
[24:05.410 --> 24:08.390]  And then one one more entry that just says go to third wheel.
[24:10.850 --> 24:13.210]  And when we land on it, we'll figure it out.
[24:13.390 --> 24:14.450]  And nothing gets figured out.
[24:14.470 --> 24:15.870]  That's where the other half of the car is.
[24:17.590 --> 24:18.930]  What's half a car?
[24:19.530 --> 24:20.250]  It's a wheel of fortune.
[24:20.530 --> 24:21.010]  Wheel of fortune.
[24:21.390 --> 24:22.610]  Oh, my God.
[24:23.350 --> 24:28.470]  I like that we got rid of the wheel initially because it ruined the integrity of the game.
[24:28.610 --> 24:29.270]  Oh, yeah.
[24:29.270 --> 24:31.730]  We're just trying to accommodate you, man.
[24:31.750 --> 24:36.370]  Now, Andrew, let me tell you, I was very interested to see how this was going.
[24:36.730 --> 24:40.490]  And then we started putting force drop and half a car on this thing.
[24:40.490 --> 24:43.570]  And now I don't care whether I win kicker picker or not.
[24:43.750 --> 24:45.530]  No, yeah, no longer matters.
[24:45.530 --> 24:46.930]  Yeah, not at all.
[24:48.970 --> 24:52.730]  I have a feeling we'll forget about kicker picker after this video.
[24:52.850 --> 24:53.730]  Absolutely not.
[24:54.070 --> 24:59.290]  If I spin the wheel and I get half a car, I'm going to get fully mad.
[25:00.190 --> 25:06.150]  If Andrew steals my best kicker that I picked, I'm going to come get I'm immediately checking out.
[25:06.630 --> 25:08.030]  Yeah, I'm not stealing from you.
[25:08.450 --> 25:09.950]  I know you'll get angry, but I'm going to take it.
[25:10.030 --> 25:11.530]  Well, I'm going to get mad, too.
[25:11.750 --> 25:13.370]  Yeah, but you're always mad, so it's fine.
[25:13.490 --> 25:14.610]  All right, that's enough.
[25:14.610 --> 25:16.290]  Jeff gets a different shade of mad.
[25:17.850 --> 25:20.830]  Jeff gets a I will stomp on everything mad.
[25:21.230 --> 25:22.270]  It's not a fun.
[25:22.890 --> 25:26.670]  Jeff is really good at making things a bad time when mad.
[25:27.030 --> 25:27.830]  You're always mad.
[25:28.430 --> 25:30.210]  I have what's called an infectious mood.
[25:32.270 --> 25:33.670]  I'm going to shuffle this.
[25:34.070 --> 25:34.330]  Hell yeah.
[25:35.350 --> 25:36.170]  There we go.
[25:38.190 --> 25:39.630]  So now what?
[25:40.650 --> 25:43.250]  Oh, the force drop should also be your best performing player.
[25:44.410 --> 25:47.890]  Oh, you've already you've already put the rule on the force drop.
[25:48.050 --> 25:49.190]  We swap wheels.
[25:49.350 --> 25:50.710]  He took his hand off the piece.
[25:50.730 --> 25:52.890]  I don't think you're done, buddy.
[25:53.330 --> 25:55.090]  OK, let's spin this stupid wheel.
[25:55.390 --> 25:56.550]  Wait, who spins first?
[25:57.850 --> 25:58.670]  What do you mean, who spins?
[25:59.030 --> 25:59.730]  What do you mean?
[25:59.850 --> 26:00.670]  We just spin this.
[26:00.910 --> 26:01.170]  All right.
[26:01.510 --> 26:04.510]  I guess I guess Nick can spin first.
[26:05.070 --> 26:06.230]  I would think that.
[26:06.390 --> 26:07.530]  Eric, will you push the spin button?
[26:07.830 --> 26:10.130]  Yeah, I would think that this is just whoever it lands on.
[26:10.170 --> 26:11.130]  It's their turn, right?
[26:11.350 --> 26:12.490]  Yeah, but who spun it?
[26:12.490 --> 26:14.330]  OK, just making sure.
[26:15.970 --> 26:18.130]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.

[26:53.690 --> 26:55.910]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's Gavin.
[26:56.430 --> 26:57.150]  All right, Gavin.
[26:57.390 --> 26:58.350]  Absolute horse shit.
[26:58.930 --> 27:02.990]  So now remove Gavin from the... remove that instance, yeah.
[27:03.290 --> 27:03.750]  You got it.
[27:03.750 --> 27:04.010]  There you go.
[27:04.070 --> 27:07.030]  OK, so Gavin, it's your turn.
[27:07.030 --> 27:11.330]  Do you want to make a pick or spin the second wheel?
[27:11.530 --> 27:12.470]  Is that how this works?
[27:12.630 --> 27:13.090]  I think so.
[27:13.170 --> 27:14.450]  Yeah, that's it.
[27:14.490 --> 27:14.870]  You got it.
[27:14.910 --> 27:15.430]  You got it.
[27:15.870 --> 27:16.930]  Oh, I'm just going to pick.
[27:17.110 --> 27:19.750]  Who is the one that someone dropped that was good?
[27:20.890 --> 27:21.570]  Go ahead.
[27:23.730 --> 27:24.950]  I'll spin the second wheel.
[27:25.110 --> 27:28.550]  OK, he's gonna spin the second wheel.
[27:28.770 --> 27:29.950]  Oh, here it goes.
[27:31.610 --> 27:32.750]  OK, say when.
[27:33.130 --> 27:34.130]  Say when you want me to do it.
[27:34.790 --> 27:35.690]  Three, two, one, go.
[27:38.130 --> 27:39.350]  Oh, oh, shit.
[27:41.730 --> 27:46.470]  Oh, oh, Gavin with the steal.
[27:47.550 --> 27:49.410]  Do I remove it or do I keep it?
[27:49.510 --> 27:50.430]  No, keep it, keep it, keep it.
[27:51.130 --> 27:54.530]  OK, Gavin, you get to steal a player from any of the teams.
[27:55.570 --> 27:56.610]  Brandon Aubrey?
[27:58.210 --> 27:59.970]  Oh, he's taken from Eric.
[28:00.670 --> 28:01.830]  Is that what he's doing?
[28:02.470 --> 28:02.990]  Yes, it's what he's doing.
[28:02.990 --> 28:03.850]  Where do I list that?
[28:05.330 --> 28:06.850]  What do I do?
[28:07.030 --> 28:08.790]  You just change him to Gavin.
[28:09.030 --> 28:11.190]  No longer have Brandon Aubrey.
[28:11.290 --> 28:12.910]  And now Gavin has seven kickers.
[28:13.430 --> 28:14.270]  No, I don't.
[28:14.330 --> 28:14.990]  I've got five.
[28:15.090 --> 28:15.510]  Oh, right.
[28:15.550 --> 28:16.350]  Because you're missing one.
[28:16.990 --> 28:17.710]  I missed two.
[28:18.330 --> 28:19.770]  We need to drop the ones we dropped.
[28:21.910 --> 28:23.770]  So now, Eric, you have four.
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.410]  Is this how you saw this going, Andrew?
[28:28.110 --> 28:31.570]  OK, this is perfect.
[28:32.690 --> 28:34.470]  So now I have four.
[28:35.610 --> 28:38.290]  Which I have to add my name here.
[28:39.350 --> 28:39.670]  I guess.
[28:40.710 --> 28:42.010]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[28:42.010 --> 28:46.130]  Well, with this, it could go on forever if we just keep stealing from each other.
[28:46.750 --> 28:50.130]  Yeah, that's why I said there'd be a cap on wheel spins, but it's fine.
[28:50.210 --> 28:51.390]  We're already locked in.
[28:51.450 --> 28:52.070]  We're spinning.
[28:52.390 --> 28:53.350]  Spin that wheel.
[28:53.870 --> 28:54.150]  OK.
[28:56.110 --> 28:57.710]  Look, you guys wanted the second wheel.
[28:58.770 --> 29:01.210]  If you land on you.
[29:01.570 --> 29:02.450]  Uh-huh.
[29:03.130 --> 29:04.210]  Oh, my God.
[29:06.370 --> 29:08.110]  Do you want to go to this?
[29:09.490 --> 29:11.610]  I'll be popping over to that second wheel, I think.
[29:17.650 --> 29:18.530]  All right.
[29:18.830 --> 29:20.510]  You let me know when you're ready.
[29:20.950 --> 29:21.530]  Three, two, one, go.
[29:28.130 --> 29:28.570]  Forced.
[29:28.570 --> 29:39.850]  Oh, my God.
[29:39.890 --> 29:40.800]  So that would be.
[29:42.230 --> 29:43.390]  Brandon Aubrey.
[29:45.250 --> 29:48.050]  So Brandon Aubrey is now in the free pool.
[29:48.510 --> 29:49.650]  He's in the free pool.
[29:49.710 --> 29:50.390]  Yes, he is.
[29:50.610 --> 29:53.490]  And now Gavin gets added back into the wheel.
[29:54.130 --> 29:54.610]  Baby.
[29:57.430 --> 29:59.810]  But doesn't he have to get added in twice?
[30:01.050 --> 30:02.470]  Uh, how many?
[30:02.570 --> 30:03.370]  Because he lost.
[30:04.190 --> 30:05.030]  Yeah, he does.
[30:05.470 --> 30:05.970]  Yeah, he does.
[30:05.990 --> 30:06.530]  Oh, you're right.
[30:06.650 --> 30:08.650]  He doesn't have enough kickers.
[30:08.930 --> 30:10.390]  Since he's lost two again.
[30:12.470 --> 30:13.750]  Gavin, spin the wheel.
[30:14.750 --> 30:15.670]  Shuffle, spin.
[30:15.990 --> 30:17.270]  Why do you put three knicks together?
[30:17.270 --> 30:18.890]  Wait, no, shuffle again, shuffle again.
[30:18.970 --> 30:19.290]  No!
[30:19.990 --> 30:21.110]  We're all grouped.
[30:22.630 --> 30:23.230]  Oh, wait.
[30:23.230 --> 30:24.210]  Yeah, that's good.
[30:24.490 --> 30:29.290]  Hey, Nick, do you want to spin the second wheel?
[30:30.430 --> 30:31.610]  No, thank you.
[30:31.690 --> 30:33.790]  I mean, in the interest of time, I'm going to get Brandon.
[30:38.150 --> 30:38.690]  OK.
[30:40.570 --> 30:42.670]  Move it all over the place.
[30:46.270 --> 30:48.450]  This is never going to end.
[30:48.730 --> 30:51.130]  There we go, spinning the wheel.
[30:51.550 --> 30:52.350]  I blame Andrew.
[30:53.410 --> 30:54.190]  I'll take blame.
[30:54.290 --> 30:54.870]  This is great.
[30:56.530 --> 30:57.250]  Yeah, Nick!
[30:57.930 --> 30:57.990]  Nick!
[30:59.270 --> 31:01.910]  Do you want to make a pick or go to the second wheel?
[31:03.130 --> 31:04.930]  No, I'm going to keep moving and make a pick.
[31:05.010 --> 31:07.050]  I'm going to get Austin Siebert from Washington.
[31:07.470 --> 31:08.390]  Making a free pick.
[31:09.690 --> 31:11.710]  He's just backing up.
[31:12.590 --> 31:13.530]  Is it like this?
[31:13.610 --> 31:14.430]  I don't know how to spell his name.
[31:14.770 --> 31:15.850]  S-E-I, S-E-I.
[31:15.970 --> 31:16.230]  It's fine.
[31:18.370 --> 31:19.450]  Jeff's like, it's close enough.
[31:19.530 --> 31:19.710]  Whatever.
[31:20.870 --> 31:21.730]  Spin the wheel!
[31:22.750 --> 31:24.530]  Should I shuffle again or are we good?
[31:25.030 --> 31:25.210]  Shuffle!
[31:25.470 --> 31:26.930]  So Nick's now down to one name.
[31:27.210 --> 31:28.130]  Yeah, yeah, one name.
[31:32.740 --> 31:33.180]  Oh!
[31:36.120 --> 31:36.640]  Oh!
[31:37.640 --> 31:38.160]  Eric!
[31:38.980 --> 31:39.540]  Uh-oh.
[31:40.120 --> 31:42.240]  He's spinning the second wheel?
[31:42.540 --> 31:43.620]  Oh, I'm having a look.
[31:43.900 --> 31:45.240]  Who do we have available?
[31:48.560 --> 31:51.560]  Honestly, I'm not really liking what we have here.
[31:52.400 --> 31:53.680]  You got to spin that.
[31:53.680 --> 31:55.100]  You could always do that second wheel.
[31:55.300 --> 31:57.560]  I'm thinking about spinning the second wheel.
[31:59.720 --> 32:00.420]  Spin it!
[32:01.760 --> 32:02.620]  Spin it!
[32:02.880 --> 32:05.200]  If he gets Brandon Ulbricht back, I'm going to lose it.
[32:07.200 --> 32:07.640]  Oh no.
[32:07.880 --> 32:08.000]  Okay.
[32:13.200 --> 32:15.060]  So it's a skip, right?
[32:15.240 --> 32:21.220]  But I'm off the other board!
[32:24.060 --> 32:26.080]  You gotta be added back in, I guess.
[32:28.460 --> 32:30.060]  That's why I think this never ends.
[32:30.060 --> 32:30.500]  Spin the wheel!
[32:36.780 --> 32:38.980]  Oh my god.
[32:39.680 --> 32:42.120]  Jeez, spin that second wheel, baby.
[32:45.740 --> 32:47.780]  I gotta remove them.
[32:48.300 --> 32:50.080]  It's three kicker pickers.
[32:50.360 --> 32:52.320]  Now add them back in.
[32:52.780 --> 32:53.900]  No, no, it's a steal.
[32:53.980 --> 32:54.700]  It's a steal!
[32:55.760 --> 32:57.440]  Only if a Brandon Ulbricht...
[33:18.820 --> 33:19.740]  Goddamn you, Gavin.
[33:26.140 --> 33:27.420]  We must be stopped.
[33:36.980 --> 33:37.840]  Son of a bitch.
[33:39.160 --> 33:40.380]  Nick, you want to make a pick?
[33:40.400 --> 33:41.540]  You want to spin that second wheel?
[33:41.540 --> 33:42.420]  No, fuck Gavin!
[33:42.540 --> 33:43.460]  Spin the second wheel!
[33:43.460 --> 33:46.960]  Oh, Geoff hasn't done anything yet.
[34:10.050 --> 34:11.270]  He's gone!
[34:12.350 --> 34:13.510]  Add him back to the wheel.
[34:25.310 --> 34:27.170]  Come on, Eric!
[34:27.870 --> 34:28.790]  Oh, man.
[34:30.110 --> 34:31.850]  Well, you know what I gotta do.
[34:31.950 --> 34:33.110]  I already got half the car.
[34:33.190 --> 34:34.090]  I gotta get the other half.
[34:34.170 --> 34:34.930]  Let's spin that wheel.
[34:42.050 --> 34:42.490]  One.
[34:44.850 --> 34:46.270]  One more time.
[34:46.690 --> 34:47.430]  I'm lightheaded.
[34:56.290 --> 34:57.890]  Return to first wheel.
[35:01.730 --> 35:04.730]  I need to get added back on here.
[35:05.610 --> 35:09.730]  Oh, my God.
[35:12.210 --> 35:14.550]  Damn that second wheel.
[35:15.630 --> 35:16.310]  Geoff!
[35:16.550 --> 35:17.210]  Oh, Geoff!
[35:18.150 --> 35:19.910]  Oh, boy.
[35:21.330 --> 35:22.370]  Big decision, Geoff.
[35:22.530 --> 35:26.450]  I'm gonna take Dustin Hopkins from the Cleveland Browns.
[35:27.930 --> 35:29.130]  Good pick.
[35:29.630 --> 35:31.710]  And then somebody can take him back from me.
[35:31.730 --> 35:32.330]  Whenever.
[35:33.390 --> 35:34.190]  What's his name?
[35:34.290 --> 35:34.950]  Dustin Hopkins?
[35:35.310 --> 35:37.510]  Yeah, I assume he's on the bottom somewhere.
[35:37.930 --> 35:38.670]  Let's see.
[35:39.250 --> 35:39.650]  He is.
[35:40.430 --> 35:40.710]  Is he?
[35:40.830 --> 35:41.190]  Okay, cool.
[35:41.490 --> 35:42.190]  That's Browns.
[35:42.250 --> 35:42.770]  Dustin Hopkins.
[35:43.330 --> 35:43.710]  Geoff!
[35:44.330 --> 35:45.250]  Way to go.
[35:45.390 --> 35:45.870]  All right.
[35:45.930 --> 35:46.390]  Great pick.
[35:46.850 --> 35:49.510]  Guys, Geoff is now off the board.
[35:55.680 --> 35:58.060]  Jesus Christ, I still haven't gotten to spin.
[35:58.560 --> 36:00.320]  Gavin, what do you think?
[36:01.520 --> 36:01.860]  Ooh.
[36:05.800 --> 36:09.680]  Oh, let me look at this list.
[36:19.060 --> 36:20.490]  Oh, Christ, it hurts.
[36:23.490 --> 36:24.730]  So, Garno?
[36:26.050 --> 36:26.890]  Graham Garno?
[36:26.990 --> 36:28.190]  Graham Garno, yeah.
[36:28.870 --> 36:29.870]  Where was he before?
[36:31.830 --> 36:33.950]  I think he's just...
[36:34.780 --> 36:35.550]  I think he's hurt.
[36:35.610 --> 36:35.850]  He sucks.
[36:36.410 --> 36:36.990]  Does he suck?
[36:37.730 --> 36:38.570]  I think he sucks.
[36:38.690 --> 36:39.750]  Let me look up Graham Garno.
[36:40.430 --> 36:40.710]  Here.
[36:41.910 --> 36:42.990]  Yeah, he just sucks.
[36:44.910 --> 36:45.730]  There's his line.
[36:45.990 --> 36:46.670]  He better be hurt.
[36:47.710 --> 36:48.610]  Yeah, exactly.
[36:49.950 --> 36:51.990]  Were you just picking based on vibes or what?
[36:52.430 --> 36:54.270]  I was just trying to remember who's been released.
[36:54.970 --> 36:56.810]  Anyone that's in the small print down here.
[36:56.990 --> 36:57.930]  Yeah, he's hurt.
[36:58.170 --> 37:01.310]  Yeah, but some people have just dropped for drop's sake and some people hurt.
[37:01.810 --> 37:02.230]  Oh, yeah.
[37:07.080 --> 37:08.100]  So, what's your move?
[37:08.840 --> 37:11.200]  I'll take Harrison Butker, I guess.
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.880]  Screw you, women.
[37:13.180 --> 37:14.520]  You're putting him back on the team?
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.460]  Putting him back on?
[37:16.540 --> 37:19.520]  Oh, you cold move.
[37:28.900 --> 37:31.100]  Oh, you fucker.
[37:31.360 --> 37:31.800]  And that's me, I think.
[37:31.800 --> 37:33.000]  Well, we're back to the spin.
[37:34.440 --> 37:36.780]  Down to the final three people.
[37:41.150 --> 37:42.250]  Might be Andrew.
[37:42.890 --> 37:43.450]  It's Nick.
[37:43.670 --> 37:44.030]  It's not.
[37:45.770 --> 37:48.010]  Well, I'm not going to spin the second wheel.
[37:48.070 --> 37:48.290]  No?
[37:48.430 --> 37:51.610]  And I'm going to pick up Joey Sly from the New England Patriots.
[37:51.810 --> 37:53.810]  How many people do you have now, Nick?
[37:54.590 --> 37:55.030]  Five.
[37:59.850 --> 38:02.250]  I had six and Gavin showed up.
[38:02.930 --> 38:04.450]  It's S-L-Y-E.
[38:05.170 --> 38:05.350]  Thank you.
[38:05.350 --> 38:05.930]  It's a great name.
[38:06.470 --> 38:07.310]  Joey Sly.
[38:07.530 --> 38:07.810]  Great name.
[38:08.050 --> 38:08.390]  All right.
[38:08.590 --> 38:12.010]  Same name as a punk rock singer who died a couple years ago.
[38:12.030 --> 38:12.370]  Oh, really?
[38:13.010 --> 38:18.410]  So now we're down to two Erics, one Andrew and one Nick.
[38:18.510 --> 38:20.690]  I don't think I've gotten the pick yet for any.
[38:20.790 --> 38:21.430]  No, I don't think so.
[38:21.510 --> 38:21.990]  Absolutely not.
[38:22.130 --> 38:22.810]  I think I'm the only one who has one.
[38:22.810 --> 38:24.210]  But I think that ends now.
[38:24.910 --> 38:25.270]  Oh!
[38:27.790 --> 38:29.630]  Well, I got to spin the second wheel.
[38:29.750 --> 38:31.130]  I just want a little bit.
[38:31.310 --> 38:33.010]  I got to spin it at least once.
[38:33.770 --> 38:36.070]  You got to have some of that second wheel fun.
[38:38.210 --> 38:38.610]  Skip.
[38:38.810 --> 38:39.450]  Please skip.
[38:40.350 --> 38:41.170]  Oh, no.
[38:42.850 --> 38:43.290]  Steal!
[38:45.030 --> 38:47.250]  Okay, give me a second to look at everyone's list.
[38:47.830 --> 38:49.510]  Take, hey, take your time, buddy.
[38:49.750 --> 38:50.510]  Oh, man.
[38:52.790 --> 38:54.090]  I know who I'd steal.
[38:54.590 --> 38:55.170]  Yeah, me too.
[38:56.770 --> 39:01.010]  Yeah, I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna steal the woman hater from Gavin,
[39:01.170 --> 39:02.130]  Harrison Butker.
[39:02.510 --> 39:03.810]  Give me that bug boy.
[39:03.990 --> 39:05.410]  Wow, you took him out of my team?
[39:05.650 --> 39:06.050]  Yeah.
[39:06.470 --> 39:09.410]  Give him back to me who I never had.
[39:09.530 --> 39:10.310]  I don't know why I said back.
[39:10.710 --> 39:11.750]  Give him back.
[39:12.450 --> 39:14.330]  Gavin back on the board.
[39:15.810 --> 39:17.030]  All right, here we go.
[39:18.330 --> 39:20.570]  Put another bullet in a loaded gun.
[39:22.570 --> 39:24.410]  Oh, this could be it.
[39:24.450 --> 39:25.270]  It could be done.
[39:25.630 --> 39:27.270]  Eric, spin the wheel, Eric.
[39:27.510 --> 39:29.170]  Are we always spinning that second wheel, Nick?
[39:29.210 --> 39:29.670]  Yeah.
[39:35.910 --> 39:37.230]  Oh, no, stop.
[39:37.830 --> 39:38.270]  Stop.
[39:38.270 --> 39:38.690]  Skip.
[39:40.130 --> 39:41.910]  Add his dumb ass back to the wheel.
[39:44.190 --> 39:46.250]  Now, if it lands on him, you just spin it again.
[39:47.610 --> 39:48.410]  Oh, God.
[39:48.650 --> 39:50.570]  What? No, it's just skip, not lose a turn.
[39:50.570 --> 39:52.250]  No, it's a double skip, isn't it?
[39:52.610 --> 39:54.070]  No, that's lose a turn.
[39:54.750 --> 39:55.570]  Oh, it's Eric.
[39:57.010 --> 39:58.470]  Oh, he's gonna spin that fucking wheel.
[39:58.710 --> 40:01.310]  Oh, guys, you know I gotta spin that second wheel.
[40:03.030 --> 40:04.490]  We are making progress, though.
[40:04.890 --> 40:05.330]  We are.
[40:05.710 --> 40:06.550]  I didn't think we would.
[40:07.050 --> 40:08.590]  I didn't think we would, but we are.
[40:14.530 --> 40:16.210]  Back to the wheel.
[40:16.390 --> 40:17.570]  Back on the wheel.
[40:18.290 --> 40:19.450]  Oh, that's for making progress.
[40:22.650 --> 40:23.850]  I mean...
[40:26.090 --> 40:26.990]  It's Eric.
[40:27.490 --> 40:29.930]  Let me get my move myself here.
[40:30.330 --> 40:32.130]  Oh, you do that second wheel?
[40:32.370 --> 40:33.830]  You absolute...
[40:41.930 --> 40:44.550]  Oh, he got forced dropped.
[40:46.430 --> 40:48.170]  He lost the game.
[40:51.830 --> 40:52.950]  Oh, shit.
[40:53.470 --> 40:54.490]  Cairo Santos.
[40:55.210 --> 40:55.550]  No.
[40:55.950 --> 40:57.650]  I thought you have to drop your best player.
[40:57.850 --> 40:59.030]  I thought it's the best player.
[40:59.750 --> 40:59.950]  What?
[41:00.430 --> 41:02.710]  I'm pretty sure we said you have to force drop your best player.
[41:03.230 --> 41:05.410]  No, that was the thing Nick added later.
[41:05.850 --> 41:08.110]  Yeah, but we followed it when Gavin went.
[41:08.550 --> 41:09.110]  Yeah, didn't I?
[41:09.570 --> 41:10.270]  Is that what you did?
[41:10.310 --> 41:11.410]  Did you drop your best player?
[41:11.870 --> 41:13.090]  I dropped Brandon Aubrey.
[41:13.850 --> 41:15.050]  Oh, wait, did he get stolen?
[41:15.210 --> 41:15.570]  I don't remember.
[41:15.710 --> 41:16.670]  No, he got stolen.
[41:17.030 --> 41:17.950]  I don't think we did.
[41:18.350 --> 41:22.430]  I don't think we did it by best player, but I'll do it just in the interest of moving this along.
[41:27.730 --> 41:28.090]  So...
[41:30.590 --> 41:31.310]  Texans kicker...
[41:31.310 --> 41:32.270]  Tommy Fairmont.
[41:32.430 --> 41:34.170]  I wish I was back on the wheel.
[41:35.070 --> 41:36.230]  Eric's back on the wheel.
[41:36.510 --> 41:37.550]  I'm here twice.
[41:37.550 --> 41:38.930]  He's back on it twice.
[41:40.190 --> 41:41.630]  Let's spin that wheel.
[41:42.090 --> 41:43.330]  Oh, land on me.
[41:46.050 --> 41:46.530]  Well...
[41:46.530 --> 41:48.390]  All right.
[41:48.510 --> 41:49.670]  Eric, you're gonna go from the pool?
[41:49.970 --> 41:51.790]  So I'm gonna go ahead and go to the pool.
[41:52.690 --> 41:54.910]  I'm gonna trap Kayami Fairburn.
[41:56.750 --> 41:57.230]  Remove.
[41:57.610 --> 41:58.970]  Let's spin again.
[41:59.850 --> 42:01.330]  Oh, I should've shit before that.
[42:02.770 --> 42:04.150]  When will you learn, man?
[42:04.610 --> 42:05.050]  Nick.
[42:05.970 --> 42:06.850]  All right.
[42:07.750 --> 42:09.010]  Spin the second wheel, Eric.
[42:10.570 --> 42:11.950]  You got it, buddy.
[42:13.450 --> 42:13.890]  Goddamn.
[42:14.710 --> 42:17.030]  People will watch this and wonder why...
[42:17.030 --> 42:17.450]  Wonder how it's...
[42:18.670 --> 42:19.110]  Yeah!
[42:20.530 --> 42:22.330]  Nick won the other half of the car!
[42:23.090 --> 42:23.530]  What's...
[42:23.530 --> 42:24.950]  So what's go to third wheel?
[42:25.590 --> 42:27.150]  I think it's just the other half of the car.
[42:27.510 --> 42:27.870]  No, no, no.
[42:27.890 --> 42:28.890]  We have to make the third wheel.
[42:29.170 --> 42:30.370]  What's the third wheel?
[42:33.950 --> 42:35.530]  What's the third wheel, guys?
[42:35.970 --> 42:38.310]  It's other half of car.
[42:38.610 --> 42:39.350]  Other half of car.
[42:39.970 --> 42:41.730]  I think 20 bucks.
[42:42.330 --> 42:44.570]  You have to buy every...
[42:44.570 --> 42:45.170]  You buy...
[42:45.170 --> 42:46.950]  You pick what everybody eats for dinner.
[42:47.950 --> 42:48.230]  Okay.
[42:48.230 --> 42:49.210]  You pick dinner.
[42:51.470 --> 42:52.930]  Lose three turns.
[42:53.710 --> 42:54.550]  No, but no.
[42:54.970 --> 42:55.570]  Let's...
[42:55.570 --> 42:56.030]  Shut up.
[42:57.490 --> 42:58.710]  Go back to the second wheel.
[42:59.150 --> 43:00.090]  Yeah, hang on.
[43:00.270 --> 43:00.350]  Hang on.
[43:00.350 --> 43:01.690]  Go back to first wheel.
[43:02.030 --> 43:05.350]  And then for the final one, full team drop.
[43:08.230 --> 43:09.610]  That is insane.
[43:10.570 --> 43:11.010]  That's...
[43:11.010 --> 43:11.390]  No, no.
[43:11.410 --> 43:12.030]  All right, Nick.
[43:12.210 --> 43:13.910]  Are you ready to spin the third wheel?
[43:13.930 --> 43:14.470]  Oh my God.
[43:15.230 --> 43:16.230]  Yeah, go ahead and spin it.
[43:16.290 --> 43:17.150]  I took my glasses off.
[43:17.650 --> 43:19.110]  Let me know when anything but full team drop.
[43:19.290 --> 43:19.750]  Just spin the wheel.
[43:20.150 --> 43:20.950]  Just spin the wheel.
[43:21.210 --> 43:22.450]  I took my glasses off.
[43:22.510 --> 43:23.090]  I can't see.
[43:23.270 --> 43:24.330]  You'll have to tell me when I go.
[43:24.710 --> 43:25.110]  Okay.
[43:27.590 --> 43:29.030]  You pick dinner.
[43:29.030 --> 43:29.970]  Dinner.
[43:30.110 --> 43:31.370]  You pick dinner.
[43:33.790 --> 43:34.390]  Okay.
[43:36.290 --> 43:37.810]  I'll tell you what's for dinner.
[43:38.110 --> 43:39.410]  We're gonna...
[43:39.410 --> 43:40.590]  We're gonna have some fajitas.
[43:41.330 --> 43:43.330]  Okay, fajitas for dinner.
[43:43.470 --> 43:44.190]  I'm gonna let Emily know.
[43:44.310 --> 43:44.870]  Hold on.
[43:47.970 --> 43:49.790]  Fajitas for dinner.
[43:50.730 --> 43:51.570]  I'm gonna text Meg.
[43:51.950 --> 43:53.470]  Text my wife.
[43:55.730 --> 43:58.770]  We have to have fajitas for dinner.
[44:00.130 --> 44:02.650]  I've just simply texted her fajitas for dinner.
[44:02.770 --> 44:03.550]  No explanation.
[44:05.190 --> 44:08.810]  I think it's funny that Nick phrased that we have to when he picked.
[44:08.970 --> 44:10.010]  It was his choice.
[44:11.030 --> 44:13.990]  Well, if I say it's from the rest of us, then she doesn't know it's me.
[44:14.130 --> 44:14.770]  Now, I just...
[44:14.770 --> 44:17.210]  I just realized I have to remove you pick dinner.
[44:17.350 --> 44:17.990]  Dinner's been picked.
[44:18.210 --> 44:18.810]  Oh, shit.
[44:19.070 --> 44:19.150]  Yeah.
[44:19.270 --> 44:20.050]  Oh, shit.
[44:20.330 --> 44:21.110]  Pick breakfast tomorrow.
[44:21.270 --> 44:22.670]  Third wheel becomes even more dangerous.
[44:23.150 --> 44:23.950]  Are you ready?
[44:24.410 --> 44:24.810]  Yes.
[44:24.970 --> 44:25.710]  To spin this first wheel.
[44:25.890 --> 44:26.090]  Here we go.
[44:26.290 --> 44:26.570]  Please spin.
[44:32.880 --> 44:34.780]  Oh, it's back to Nick.
[44:35.180 --> 44:37.680]  Nick, do you want to make a pick or do you want to spin the second wheel?
[44:38.000 --> 44:38.880]  Spin the second wheel.
[44:38.980 --> 44:40.100]  Spin the second wheel.
[44:41.060 --> 44:42.620]  I just want to steal something.
[44:42.780 --> 44:43.020]  That's all.
[44:46.300 --> 44:47.020]  Spin again.
[44:50.920 --> 44:51.880]  Spin that wheel.
[44:55.460 --> 44:57.760]  Have you guys been watching Ryan Seacrest?
[44:58.640 --> 44:59.360]  Oh, shit.
[44:59.380 --> 45:00.200]  On the wheel.
[45:00.440 --> 45:00.820]  All right.
[45:01.120 --> 45:07.060]  So, Nick loses this turn and his next turn.
[45:07.680 --> 45:11.360]  So, do I even put him back on the first wheel for this one?
[45:11.960 --> 45:12.500]  No, don't.
[45:12.980 --> 45:13.660]  Here we go.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.620]  Go on, go on.
[45:21.200 --> 45:21.720]  Eric.
[45:25.380 --> 45:26.700]  Spinning that second wheel.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.280]  Oh, it's a skip.
[45:33.300 --> 45:34.460]  Skip wall.
[45:35.100 --> 45:36.600]  All right, Nick comes back in.
[45:41.020 --> 45:43.020]  I feel like we're going to be at four forever.
[45:44.080 --> 45:44.560]  Devin.
[45:48.060 --> 45:51.240]  Going for the pool or are you going for the second wheel?
[45:52.920 --> 45:53.960]  How many am I missing?
[45:54.100 --> 45:54.320]  One?
[45:54.740 --> 45:55.020]  Just one?
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.800]  Greg Joseph.
[45:59.840 --> 46:00.500]  Greg Joseph?
[46:00.620 --> 46:01.220]  What team is he on?
[46:03.000 --> 46:03.500]  Giants.
[46:04.540 --> 46:05.040]  Oof.
[46:06.480 --> 46:07.360]  Greg Joseph.
[46:08.860 --> 46:09.980]  Gavin is locked in.
[46:10.060 --> 46:10.580]  Greg Joseph.
[46:10.880 --> 46:13.100]  The Giants are just a bad team.
[46:13.860 --> 46:14.100]  Oh.
[46:14.600 --> 46:15.840]  Which may lead to more kicks.
[46:16.100 --> 46:17.080]  Should have done the second wheel.
[46:17.840 --> 46:22.600]  Yeah, you definitely should have done the second wheel, but now it's just me and Nick.
[46:23.640 --> 46:24.840]  Then there were two.
[46:26.120 --> 46:27.340]  Well, three with Eric's two.
[46:27.980 --> 46:28.180]  Shit.
[46:28.860 --> 46:29.120]  Oh!
[46:29.120 --> 46:29.460]  Oh!
[46:30.260 --> 46:30.820]  Hang on.
[46:31.040 --> 46:32.220]  Okay, let me have a look.
[46:32.880 --> 46:33.660]  Let me see who we got.
[46:35.540 --> 46:37.680]  See if there's anyone on here that I want.
[46:40.060 --> 46:40.460]  Hmm.
[46:42.060 --> 46:43.840]  Somebody, who got Austin Seabrook?
[46:43.860 --> 46:44.640]  That was Jeff?
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.900]  No, that's Nick.
[46:45.980 --> 46:46.420]  That was me.
[46:46.600 --> 46:46.840]  Nick.
[46:49.280 --> 46:51.240]  Oh, and then who got Joey Slott?
[46:51.320 --> 46:52.140]  That was you, Jeff?
[46:52.420 --> 46:54.460]  That was Gavin or Nick.
[46:54.600 --> 46:55.020]  That was Nick.
[46:55.340 --> 46:56.200]  Wow, Nick.
[46:56.260 --> 46:58.560]  I got Dustin Hopkins was who I picked.
[46:58.560 --> 46:58.800]  Okay.
[47:00.600 --> 47:01.080]  Hmm.
[47:01.540 --> 47:02.240]  I think...
[47:05.240 --> 47:09.760]  I think I'm gonna go with Brandon McManus just in the interest of moving something along here.
[47:10.060 --> 47:11.880]  Well, Brandon McManus is a great kicker.
[47:12.100 --> 47:12.740]  It's a good pick.
[47:13.140 --> 47:14.480]  He kicks a good ball.
[47:15.200 --> 47:15.460]  He does.
[47:15.560 --> 47:16.000]  He does.
[47:16.420 --> 47:21.060]  But I'm also not done because there is one more Eric.
[47:21.500 --> 47:25.060]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[47:25.420 --> 47:28.300]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[47:28.300 --> 47:32.000]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[47:32.380 --> 47:33.880]  Available for a limited time.
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.220]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[47:37.580 --> 47:38.660]  Brace the rudders!
[47:39.140 --> 47:39.900]  Brace the sails!
[47:40.040 --> 47:41.000]  Brace the sails!
[47:41.240 --> 47:43.660]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching.
[47:43.960 --> 47:44.180]  Over.
[47:44.640 --> 47:44.980]  Roger.
[47:45.400 --> 47:48.580]  Wait, is that an enterprise sales solution?

[48:08.920 --> 48:10.140]  Yeah, what would you like?
[48:10.480 --> 48:11.340]  Go to fourth wheel.
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.600]  I'm so glad.
[48:12.660 --> 48:14.200]  I'm so glad you put that in there.
[48:14.260 --> 48:14.660]  I was gonna...
[48:15.700 --> 48:17.240]  I was lamenting that we didn't do that.
[48:17.620 --> 48:18.080]  There it is.
[48:18.560 --> 48:20.320]  Let me shuffle this a bunch of times.
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.160]  There you go.
[48:21.640 --> 48:21.960]  All right.
[48:22.600 --> 48:23.400]  Here we go, me and Nick.
[48:23.540 --> 48:23.940]  Spin the wheel!
[48:24.780 --> 48:25.660]  50-50, Nick.
[48:25.900 --> 48:26.380]  How you feeling?
[48:28.800 --> 48:29.320]  Uh...
[48:29.900 --> 48:31.740]  Well, that's good.
[48:31.800 --> 48:32.880]  You don't have to make any decision.
[48:33.120 --> 48:34.640]  You don't have to make any decisions.
[48:35.380 --> 48:36.720]  Because I'm going to the second wheel!
[48:37.220 --> 48:41.220]  Oh, what you gonna get on the second wheel of madness?
[48:43.060 --> 48:47.320]  It's lining up for Skip again.
[48:48.480 --> 48:49.900]  Spin the first fucking wheel.
[48:50.140 --> 48:50.920]  Spin it again.
[48:54.350 --> 48:54.770]  No!
[48:55.790 --> 48:55.970]  Keep rolling!
[48:56.150 --> 48:57.550]  Eric is on a roll.
[48:57.550 --> 48:59.990]  Well, now you know what I got to do, guys.
[49:00.230 --> 49:02.610]  Remove my name and go back to the second wheel.
[49:02.610 --> 49:03.090]  To the second wheel.
[49:05.510 --> 49:05.870]  Force it.
[49:06.150 --> 49:06.390]  First.
[49:06.750 --> 49:07.190]  Force it.
[49:07.390 --> 49:07.770]  Force it.
[49:08.050 --> 49:08.670]  Force it.
[49:08.710 --> 49:09.050]  Uh-oh.
[49:09.390 --> 49:09.790]  Richard!
[49:10.030 --> 49:11.250]  Turn to the first wheel!
[49:11.250 --> 49:12.390]  To the first wheel!
[49:12.770 --> 49:14.530]  Put your name back on that first wheel, Eric.
[49:17.490 --> 49:18.610]  Let's spin the wheel!
[49:21.910 --> 49:23.010]  Come on, man!
[49:23.370 --> 49:24.230]  Oh, Derek again!
[49:25.030 --> 49:26.670]  Eric, what are you gonna do with winning this?
[49:26.670 --> 49:27.670]  Hang on.
[49:27.850 --> 49:29.050]  I got to remove.
[49:29.250 --> 49:29.590]  There we go.
[49:29.770 --> 49:31.190]  Now let's get back to the second wheel!
[49:31.450 --> 49:32.790]  It's the second wheel!
[49:32.950 --> 49:33.970]  Who could have seen this?
[49:35.150 --> 49:37.550]  Maybe keep your name on there until the next time.
[49:39.570 --> 49:40.930]  And it's Skip!
[49:40.970 --> 49:43.010]  We're going back to the first wheel.
[49:43.250 --> 49:44.330]  I gotta shuffle these.
[49:45.150 --> 49:45.530]  What?
[49:48.690 --> 49:49.870]  Now, Eric, spin the wheel!
[49:53.330 --> 49:54.370]  Oh, it might be Nick!
[49:54.650 --> 49:55.410]  It might be Nick!
[49:56.490 --> 49:57.950]  Oh, can you believe that?
[49:58.190 --> 49:59.470]  Eric wins the wheel again!
[49:59.650 --> 50:01.310]  Eric, what are you gonna do with your wheel wins?
[50:01.310 --> 50:01.770]  Remove my name.
[50:02.030 --> 50:02.510]  Oh, I'm going to that.
[50:02.610 --> 50:03.970]  Andrew, you know I gotta go to that second wheel.
[50:04.150 --> 50:05.630]  Oh, he's spinning the second wheel!
[50:08.910 --> 50:09.630]  Oh, no!
[50:10.010 --> 50:10.630]  Oh, no!
[50:11.670 --> 50:12.270]  Oh, Skip!
[50:12.810 --> 50:15.610]  Oh, he's almost going to the third wheel, but it is a Skip!
[50:15.770 --> 50:17.050]  So back to the first wheel!
[50:19.450 --> 50:20.510]  Eric, spin the wheel!
[50:23.090 --> 50:24.010]  Might be Nick!
[50:24.330 --> 50:24.990]  It's Nick!
[50:24.990 --> 50:26.470]  Nick won the wheel!
[50:26.650 --> 50:27.450]  Nick, what are you gonna do?
[50:27.470 --> 50:28.870]  Yeah, spin the wheel!
[50:32.890 --> 50:34.130]  Spin that second wheel!
[50:39.950 --> 50:41.510]  Oh, Nick gets a block!
[50:42.090 --> 50:42.590]  Who are you?
[50:42.670 --> 50:45.050]  All right, who are you blocking?
[50:45.130 --> 50:46.810]  Who cannot be taken from your team?
[50:47.030 --> 50:47.830]  Is that how it works?
[50:47.890 --> 50:50.410]  Or does he just have a block card that he can play if someone tries to steal?
[50:50.430 --> 50:51.190]  Okay, that's good.
[50:51.490 --> 50:52.590]  Yeah, block at any time.
[50:52.650 --> 50:54.190]  So let me add Nick back onto this wheel.
[50:54.190 --> 50:56.070]  All right, let's spin the first wheel!
[50:56.310 --> 50:58.330]  I forgot he'd be back.
[51:01.590 --> 51:04.730]  Okay, oh, he's pretty good.
[51:05.090 --> 51:06.110]  Don't remove it!
[51:06.190 --> 51:06.910]  Gonna remove it!
[51:07.690 --> 51:09.970]  And let's spin that second wheel!
[51:10.630 --> 51:13.690]  What's he gonna get on the Wheel of Madness?
[51:17.430 --> 51:20.710]  He won the same half in the same car!
[51:21.150 --> 51:24.770]  Eric has two halves of the same car, but the same broken half.
[51:24.950 --> 51:26.910]  He's got two left shoes.
[51:28.730 --> 51:30.470]  I'm spinning the first wheel!
[51:31.470 --> 51:32.950]  How is your car split?
[51:33.110 --> 51:34.670]  Is it front, back, or left, right?
[51:34.970 --> 51:35.770]  Oh, it's left, right.
[51:35.790 --> 51:36.290]  Or top, bottom.
[51:36.490 --> 51:37.330]  I would want to have the top.
[51:37.350 --> 51:39.450]  I would want to have the bottom half of my car.
[51:39.770 --> 51:40.410]  Oh my god.
[51:40.630 --> 51:42.710]  Nick, do you want to go to the second wheel?
[51:42.970 --> 51:43.770]  Yeah, spin it.
[51:44.010 --> 51:45.010]  Spin the second wheel!
[51:53.930 --> 51:56.530]  Okay, you lost your turn, so skip on this one.
[51:56.850 --> 51:59.730]  Yeah, so just spin this wheel again because it's going to be you.
[51:59.730 --> 52:01.010]  You're going to want the second wheel.
[52:01.030 --> 52:01.510]  Because that's what you want.
[52:01.590 --> 52:03.730]  Why? What makes you think I want to take the second wheel?
[52:03.770 --> 52:04.810]  Hey, you know what? That's a good point.
[52:05.470 --> 52:07.550]  Why wouldn't I want to take a kicker here?
[52:08.490 --> 52:09.350]  That's a great point, Eric.
[52:09.450 --> 52:12.070]  Maybe you should spin the first wheel again with just your name on it.
[52:12.130 --> 52:16.550]  But if Eric spins now and Nick misses his next turn, no one will go.
[52:19.960 --> 52:20.320]  What?
[52:21.520 --> 52:22.480]  No, you don't understand.
[52:23.940 --> 52:28.380]  If Eric picks now, his name will be off the wheel and only Nick will be on the wheel.
[52:28.800 --> 52:32.320]  No, so this is the spin that Nick is removed from.
[52:32.760 --> 52:36.340]  So it'll be Eric, and then once Eric makes his pick, then Nick is back on.
[52:36.840 --> 52:37.620]  Oh, he's already back on?
[52:37.920 --> 52:38.180]  Yes.
[52:38.360 --> 52:38.540]  Yes.
[52:39.500 --> 52:41.080]  I just didn't want no one to be on the wheel.
[52:41.120 --> 52:43.640]  No, no, no, don't worry about that. Nick will be on that wheel.
[52:46.520 --> 52:47.400]  Eric, spin the wheel!
[52:48.560 --> 52:50.960]  Why the fuck are you doing that? Why?
[52:51.440 --> 52:53.580]  I'll land it on Eric. Eric, what are you going to do?
[52:53.780 --> 52:55.520]  All right, it's me. Hang on, hang on.
[52:56.260 --> 52:57.100]  I'm going to remove myself.
[52:57.300 --> 52:57.640]  Okay.
[52:57.920 --> 52:59.320]  I'm going to spin the second wheel.
[52:59.380 --> 53:00.400]  He's spinning the second wheel.
[53:02.300 --> 53:04.320]  I'd love to know how many wheel spins we've had.
[53:06.520 --> 53:10.520]  Okay, that skips. So now it's just Nick on the wheel.
[53:10.760 --> 53:11.840]  No, no, it's both of us.
[53:11.860 --> 53:12.500]  It's both of you, yeah.
[53:13.560 --> 53:14.960]  If you get to go again...
[53:17.060 --> 53:17.720]  Oh, Nick, it's up to you, buddy.
[53:17.720 --> 53:19.580]  I'm shocked that neither of you are pulling for the pool.
[53:19.640 --> 53:20.860]  I think there's some good kickers there.
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.620]  Yeah, I think so.
[53:22.700 --> 53:25.720]  But you know what? In the interest of time, let's spin the wheel.
[53:30.560 --> 53:32.120]  I wonder when this goes.
[53:34.560 --> 53:35.800]  Oh, it's a steal!
[53:37.420 --> 53:39.480]  Okay, who am I stealing?
[53:42.600 --> 53:45.440]  Nick, I give you permission to steal from me, if you'd like to.
[53:46.540 --> 53:48.200]  Oh, that's very sweet of you.
[53:49.860 --> 53:51.940]  Will Lutz, from Andrew.
[53:54.060 --> 53:54.460]  Denver.
[53:55.160 --> 53:56.820]  Denver, Will Lutz, got it.
[53:56.940 --> 53:58.560]  Putting a curse on that man as soon as we're done.
[54:00.780 --> 54:04.460]  Wait, am I? Oh, Broncos.
[54:04.740 --> 54:06.960]  Sorry, I got all mixed up.
[54:08.300 --> 54:09.140]  Put me back on that wheel.
[54:09.380 --> 54:11.340]  All right, Andrew, just put me back on that wheel.
[54:11.900 --> 54:13.000]  Me and Andrew on the wheel!
[54:15.280 --> 54:16.080]  Oh, shit.
[54:21.200 --> 54:23.080]  And it's me.
[54:23.260 --> 54:25.380]  Okay, I'll remove myself, spin that second wheel.
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.420]  Do you remember when this was just going to be a simple redraft?
[54:30.560 --> 54:31.040]  No!
[54:32.340 --> 54:32.820]  No!
[54:33.760 --> 54:34.540]  Go to third wheel!
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.100]  We're going to the third wheel!
[54:36.540 --> 54:37.460]  No, Eric!
[54:39.400 --> 54:41.420]  You gotta add tomorrow's breakfast.
[54:42.320 --> 54:42.700]  Oh, yeah.
[54:43.060 --> 54:44.040]  Pick tomorrow or lunch.
[54:44.320 --> 54:45.040]  Pick tomorrow's lunch.
[54:47.360 --> 54:48.600]  Oh, my god.
[54:49.820 --> 54:50.740]  Here we go!
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.220]  No, anything but full team drop.
[54:53.360 --> 54:54.420]  Anything but full team drop.
[54:54.940 --> 54:55.760]  No full team drop.
[54:55.760 --> 54:57.080]  Oh, we're past it, we're past it.
[54:57.760 --> 54:59.940]  Go back to second wheel.
[55:03.440 --> 55:05.500]  Get me out of this hell!
[55:06.040 --> 55:07.740]  You created this hell!
[55:07.820 --> 55:09.420]  Yeah, I'm ready to leave now, though.
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.900]  You can't leave your hell!
[55:13.900 --> 55:16.000]  You're the architect of hell.
[55:16.360 --> 55:18.560]  To be fair, we all put hands on this hell.
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.200]  I had a different hell planned, and we all built this.
[55:22.200 --> 55:23.340]  You're Ted Danson.
[55:25.060 --> 55:27.420]  All right, let's see who it lands on.
[55:28.740 --> 55:30.800]  Okay, I'll remove myself here.
[55:30.820 --> 55:32.600]  Can he stop winning this fucking wheel?
[55:32.640 --> 55:33.260]  Go to the second wheel!
[55:37.540 --> 55:38.140]  Skip.
[55:38.700 --> 55:41.300]  Jesus Christ, just let me win one.
[55:42.320 --> 55:44.300]  All right, let's head on back.
[55:44.300 --> 55:47.700]  Get back on this wheel here, and let's spin the first wheel!
[55:48.400 --> 55:50.060]  How long has this recording been going?
[55:50.220 --> 55:51.100]  Oh, too long.
[55:54.100 --> 55:55.420]  And it is...
[55:56.540 --> 55:56.980]  Eric!
[55:57.500 --> 55:58.780]  Oh, you know I gotta go to that second wheel.
[56:00.780 --> 56:03.820]  I blame you, Andrew, for all of this.
[56:03.840 --> 56:04.320]  So much.
[56:04.340 --> 56:04.960]  You blame me?
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.280]  You're the one that filled the wheel!
[56:07.680 --> 56:09.280]  You're the one who brought the wheels!
[56:09.500 --> 56:12.520]  Yeah, but I wanted to put a cap on how many spins you could do.
[56:12.520 --> 56:14.120]  Well, you didn't.
[56:15.460 --> 56:17.560]  And it is...
[56:18.800 --> 56:19.100]  Andrew.
[56:19.560 --> 56:20.260]  Hang on.
[56:21.960 --> 56:22.360]  Andrew!
[56:22.700 --> 56:23.680]  I want to take from the pool.
[56:23.960 --> 56:24.580]  Can you just watch you spin that wheel?
[56:24.580 --> 56:25.800]  Oh, you're gonna take from the pool!
[56:26.020 --> 56:27.120]  Yeah, I want to take from the pool.
[56:27.260 --> 56:27.660]  Okay.
[56:29.100 --> 56:31.500]  No, I think there's some good options in the pool.
[56:31.620 --> 56:32.160]  Let me, uh...
[56:32.160 --> 56:32.460]  Great!
[56:32.840 --> 56:34.380]  Let's see, what do we got here on this?
[56:36.300 --> 56:37.880]  Who wound up with Brandon Aubrey?
[56:39.420 --> 56:39.820]  Gavin.
[56:40.600 --> 56:42.060]  Okay, I'm gonna take Jason Sanders.
[56:42.060 --> 56:43.080]  From the Dolphins.
[56:43.460 --> 56:44.580]  Oh, okay.
[56:45.160 --> 56:46.840]  Now the Tua's back, feeling a little bit better about their chances.
[56:46.840 --> 56:50.180]  Yeah, I think Tua, with Tua returning, and I think they could get their offense going.
[56:50.740 --> 56:55.380]  I'm hoping for a second half of the season return for what the Dolphins could be.
[56:55.860 --> 56:56.860]  Yeah, so are they.
[56:57.180 --> 56:57.400]  Yep.
[56:58.040 --> 57:00.360]  All right, and now we get back here.
[57:00.980 --> 57:01.540]  It's Eric.
[57:01.820 --> 57:02.160]  Hang on.
[57:02.220 --> 57:02.580]  Edrick.
[57:03.440 --> 57:04.300]  Here's Edrick!
[57:04.560 --> 57:04.920]  Edrick!
[57:05.000 --> 57:05.780]  The gothic horror.
[57:06.240 --> 57:06.620]  Edrick.
[57:08.320 --> 57:09.640]  I only need one more!
[57:13.050 --> 57:14.170]  Okay, let me get it off there.
[57:14.450 --> 57:14.630]  And Eric wins.
[57:14.890 --> 57:17.470]  Now, I think...
[57:17.470 --> 57:18.530]  Let me see.
[57:19.410 --> 57:20.650]  I think I'm gonna go to the second wheel.
[57:20.890 --> 57:21.010]  Yeah.
[57:22.010 --> 57:23.270]  You son of a bitch.
[57:27.110 --> 57:27.470]  Skip.
[57:28.230 --> 57:29.210]  Just spin it again.
[57:29.450 --> 57:30.530]  Just spin this wheel again.
[57:30.630 --> 57:30.870]  Are you sure?
[57:30.870 --> 57:31.990]  If you go back to that other wheel, don't go back to that other wheel.
[57:31.990 --> 57:32.590]  Yeah, just spin it again.
[57:32.710 --> 57:34.010]  I can put my name back on here, though.
[57:34.030 --> 57:34.230]  Don't. No.
[57:34.550 --> 57:35.090]  Are you sure?
[57:35.550 --> 57:35.770]  Yeah.
[57:36.230 --> 57:36.530]  Okay.
[57:36.830 --> 57:38.290]  No, you gotta spin the first one.
[57:38.370 --> 57:38.970]  Okay, thank you.
[57:39.130 --> 57:39.630]  God damn it!
[57:39.850 --> 57:41.290]  God damn it, Gavin!
[57:42.270 --> 57:43.550]  We gotta do it right.
[57:43.690 --> 57:45.390]  We're nothing if not regulation.
[57:45.810 --> 57:46.470]  That's true.
[57:46.570 --> 57:47.510]  Let's not half-asses.
[57:47.930 --> 57:48.230]  Yeah.
[57:48.630 --> 57:49.290]  We're too far in.
[57:49.610 --> 57:52.510]  You know what? I'd like to apologize to everybody. Sorry.
[57:52.810 --> 57:53.170]  That's all right.
[57:53.310 --> 57:53.770]  Eric won.
[57:54.270 --> 57:55.230]  I'm gonna spin that second wheel.
[57:55.650 --> 57:58.450]  Now, what are you trying to get on this second wheel, Eric?
[57:58.590 --> 57:59.130]  Probably steel.
[57:59.970 --> 58:00.910]  I'm thinking about his steel.
[58:01.710 --> 58:02.330]  Force drop.
[58:03.330 --> 58:06.990]  Yeah, you have to go two fucking times.
[58:07.610 --> 58:08.230]  Hang on.
[58:10.450 --> 58:11.950]  No, you're a nightmare!
[58:15.170 --> 58:17.250]  Hey, we could upload audio here when we're done.
[58:17.890 --> 58:19.610]  Oh, we're not even close to done, buddy.
[58:19.650 --> 58:20.830]  I know. I'm just putting it here.
[58:21.770 --> 58:24.570]  Kiyomi Fairbirm. I think I'm gonna spin that first wheel.
[58:24.950 --> 58:29.030]  How long was the first Hector Picker? It had to have been half this.
[58:29.610 --> 58:30.810]  All right, hang on. Hang on.
[58:31.270 --> 58:32.730]  Oh my god.
[58:33.070 --> 58:33.410]  Hang on.
[58:33.570 --> 58:34.330]  You might get him back.
[58:34.590 --> 58:35.310]  Oh, you did.
[58:35.670 --> 58:36.170]  That's good.
[58:36.170 --> 58:41.490]  And I'm gonna go ahead and make it over here, and I'm gonna select Kiyomi Fairbirm.
[58:41.710 --> 58:48.010]  I never thought I would see the day that Eric out-Andrewed Andrew, but this is awesome.
[58:49.230 --> 58:50.030]  I'm gonna spin that first wheel.
[58:50.470 --> 58:52.670]  Imagine if he gets the full team drop, but he's like this.
[58:52.670 --> 58:55.250]  I know. I've been thinking about it. Six Erics.
[58:55.530 --> 58:58.490]  I will walk out of this recording if Eric gets the full team drop.
[58:59.190 --> 59:01.090]  The first one was 35 minutes.
[59:01.290 --> 59:03.450]  This was Andrew, right? Okay, this is good.
[59:04.310 --> 59:05.990]  Greg Zurlein's still available, right?
[59:06.170 --> 59:07.370]  But he's on thin ice.
[59:07.570 --> 59:08.490]  It feels like he's...
[59:09.110 --> 59:09.690]  You know what?
[59:10.070 --> 59:11.430]  I gotta spin that second wheel.
[59:15.290 --> 59:16.710]  Oh my god.
[59:16.970 --> 59:17.770]  Oh my god.
[59:18.130 --> 59:18.530]  Oh my god.
[59:18.610 --> 59:19.070]  No!
[59:20.030 --> 59:22.210]  No, don't go to the third wheel!
[59:22.410 --> 59:23.410]  The third wheel.
[59:23.510 --> 59:24.190]  Oh god.
[59:24.450 --> 59:25.310]  Are you ready?
[59:26.030 --> 59:26.770]  Are you ready?
[59:27.830 --> 59:28.350]  No!
[59:32.050 --> 59:33.750]  Go back to the second wheel.
[59:33.750 --> 59:34.930]  Go back to the second wheel.
[59:34.950 --> 59:35.290]  Okay.
[59:36.170 --> 59:39.750]  Oh, every time. That third wheel is so scary.
[59:40.450 --> 59:41.670]  Go to the second.
[59:42.790 --> 59:45.710]  Gavin made the third wheel scary with the full team drop.
[59:45.950 --> 59:47.170]  I gotta lose a turn.
[59:47.970 --> 59:49.610]  Doesn't matter. Just spin.
[59:49.770 --> 59:50.030]  All right.
[59:50.870 --> 59:53.010]  Just try to take yourself off the first wheel.
[59:56.090 --> 59:57.410]  Put no what?
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.120]  Spinning a blank wheel!
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.000]  Okay.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.960]  He doesn't need to spin a one wheel!
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.260]  So now you can put your game back on.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.440]  I'm gonna shit myself.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.120]  I can't believe we have to record again today.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.300]  I'm so tired.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.220]  Do something live today.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.920]  We have to eat fajitas.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.300]  I have to go to Texas Roadhouse to do it too, I think.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.380]  All right.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.780]  Oh, he gets the steal!
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.500]  I'm gonna steal. Who do I want?
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.300]  I'm thinking...
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.760]  You can't steal from me. I got a block.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.880]  I'm thinking I'm gonna take the Cowboys' Brandon Aubrey.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.900]  What do you mean?
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.320]  Now he's back on my team.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.060]  There we go.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.520]  We're good. And now we're back here.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.800]  Gavin's on the board.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.040]  Gavin, you ready to spin that wheel?
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.060]  Yeah, spin away.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.280]  All right, spinning that wheel.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.320]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.440]  Oh, wow, Gavin won.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:05.600]  Hang on.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.300]  No, yeah, you're right.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:08.880]  I want to jump the gun.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:09.820]  Oh, there we go.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.760]  Okay, he won now.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.020]  I'll pop over to the second wheel.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.320]  Oh, the second wheel, you got it, buddy.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.480]  The second wheel.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.520]  All right, here we go.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.120]  I'm determined to get to that fourth wheel.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.760]  Okay, that's good.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:26.420]  Hang on.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.700]  An unavailable wheel spin.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.700]  Not applicable.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.120]  Whatever, they both start with A.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:39.660]  Move.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.140]  All right, Gavin, getting back on the first wheel.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.120]  Andrew, remember when you messaged me earlier
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.780]  and you asked about if a stealing mechanic would work for this?
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.360]  And I said, I think if we do this again,
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.780]  maybe it would work, but maybe not for this one.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.480]  Oh, you knew about this?
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.320]  I didn't know about what this was going to be.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.060]  Okay, so you're part of the problem.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:01.060]  At what point do you think this became torture for the audience?
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.460]  30 minutes ago.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.900]  Yeah, probably 20 minutes in.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.820]  Gavin, do you want to just make your pick
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.920]  or do you want to spin the second wheel?
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:08.460]  I'll spin.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.140]  Oh, let's spin that second wheel.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.140]  Can't wait to see what we're going to have for breakfast.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.840]  Oh my god, oh my god.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.800]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.220]  Skip.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.180]  Okay, yep, that's tough.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.880]  So you're back here.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]  Let's spin the first wheel.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.120]  Oh.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:34.580]  People, we should award a badge or like some sort of a patch
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.820]  that we mail out to people that have 100% watch time in this video.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.140]  Gavin, would you like to make a pick?
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:41.140]  I'll spin the wheel.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.240]  Oh, you spin the wheel, okay.
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.540]  Spin that wheel.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.180]  Also, the Chained Together logo on this thing the whole time has been really great.
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.020]  Oh!
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.980]  It's a steal!
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.220]  It's a steal, I have a feeling I know.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.080]  Gavin, Gavin, what are you thinking?
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.420]  Gavin, you're welcome to steal from me if you want.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.680]  Um, I mean, Brandon Aubrey's always looking good.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:02.220]  Uh-huh.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.360]  Go ahead and pop him on my team.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.480]  Great, I just, I didn't even have to paste it, I just hit undo.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.620]  All right, back to the first wheel.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.280]  Oh.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.340]  The sound effect died.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.380]  It's never gonna end.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.160]  What if Eric just picks?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.820]  He's not gonna, he's not gonna relate.
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.800]  Get on over that second wheel!
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.000]  God almighty.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.180]  It's, this is gonna have to end when we have to do the sloppy-
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.800]  Oh my god, it's a steal?
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.080]  Oh god, dude.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.100]  Well, hang on, let me see what my choices are.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.960]  All right, I'm gonna take Cowboy's Brandon Aubrey.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.600]  Did you just hit redo?
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:40.240]  Yeah.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.000]  Gavin, you ready?
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.980]  Hey, Andrew, Andrew, do you know what the shortcut is for redo?
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.360]  No.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:48.440]  Okay.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.120]  I don't know any shortcuts.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.360]  We'll cover that in 230.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.420]  Gavin, you've been selected.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.600]  Okay, I'll spin the second wheel.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.200]  I learned that recently.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.500]  Okay, let's get to the second wheel.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.260]  I hate you guys so much.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.620]  So, what's undo?
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:03.900]  Ah, shit.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.880]  Let's go ahead and lose a turn.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.380]  That's what Gavin wanted to do in this scenario.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:08.560]  Okay.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.320]  There's nothing.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.820]  How many wheel spins have we had?
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.520]  I must know.
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.980]  We're over 100.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:20.540]  Oh, 46.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.700]  On this wheel?
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:22.300]  Yeah.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.060]  We gotta add the wheel totals.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.520]  Oh, back it up.
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.760]  Add the wheel totals.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.940]  Just pick from the pool.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.360]  There's plenty of good kickers in the pool.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.760]  I feel like you get a better deal on the second wheel.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.340]  You take it in the second wheel's where you want to go?
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:40.720]  Okay.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.740]  I mean, really, we're off to the third wheel, aren't we?
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.740]  I'm certainly not.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:48.440]  Skip.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.260]  It's tough.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:51.780]  Tough.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.020]  Gavin, tough luck.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.260]  Let's go back to the first wheel.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.620]  I don't want to keep going.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.200]  I don't want to be the one to end it.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:02.860]  I gotta stand up.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:03.260]  I'm fucking...
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.040]  I ran out of water so long ago.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:07.780]  Got your choice.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.820]  We got all the kickers in the field.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.280]  Oh, you want the second wheel?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:11.860]  You got it, buddy.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.080]  It's a steal!
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.440]  Oh, wow, what a steal.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.080]  Gavin, you're welcome to steal for me.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.680]  I'm gonna steal...
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.880]  Kamey Fairbairn?
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.980]  You fucking asshole.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.480]  You suck!
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.040]  I'm going to the second wheel!
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.460]  I actually might shit.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.800]  Put the mic close to your butt.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.880]  Now, here's what I'm thinking.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.840]  If I could have my choice of anyone on this list,
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.940]  it's gotta be Houston Texans kicker Kamey Fairbairn.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.780]  So there you go.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.740]  Gavin, get you back on that first wheel.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.120]  I think, Andrew, next year when we do the kicker re-picker,
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.160]  once, you know, steel backsies.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:23.760]  Yeah, no.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:24.220]  Yeah.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.500]  Yeah, I think maybe this isn't the format for next time, but what do I know?
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.800]  Hey, Gavin, second wheel or you want to make your pick?
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.040]  Yeah, second wheel.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.580]  I think this might be the format for everything going forward now.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.720]  The fucking nested wheel structure.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.420]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:39.880]  I can't.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.460]  You know what to do.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.200]  Fuck it.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.900]  It's a steal!
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.100]  All right, Gavin, who do you think?
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.460]  Anyone on this board who's thinking?
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:45.160]  You can steal from me.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:45.900]  Just hit undo.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.400]  You got it.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.480]  Oh, that's Brandon Aubrey, sorry.
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:48.780]  Oh.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.700]  We're taking too many steps backward.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:53.460]  I apologize.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.320]  It's just Gavin and Eric jerking each other off.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:00.840]  I'm jerking myself off.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.280]  Wait, what?
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.280]  Hang on, I might land on this line.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.180]  Oh, that was close.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:06.180]  You edging?
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.900]  What's going on?
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.780]  Get my name off of there and give it a big spin.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.580]  It's you two stealing the same dick to jerk with.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.000]  Mine, no mine.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:15.980]  Oh!
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.600]  Spin again!
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.620]  Oh, that was almost force drop.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.740]  I wonder what the odds are of getting to the fourth wheel.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.820]  Insane, so stop trying.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:28.980]  Please land.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.740]  Oh, it's landed.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.920]  It's landed on steel.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.580]  I'm thinking I want...
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:38.180]  Oh boy, Houston Texans kicker Kiami Fairburn.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.920]  So Gavin, that means you're going...
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.840]  You're the only one left in this whole thing.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.360]  So let's see where this lands.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.060]  Our five minutes in.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.500]  Yeah, I mean, like...
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:48.560]  I will...
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.400]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.240]  Gavin!
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.020]  All right, Gavin.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.420]  I will pick Greg Zurlaj.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.840]  Oh my god!
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.240]  Uh, I think he's a good player.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.800]  Um, I think he could win it for me.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.340]  He's done it, guys!
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.300]  It is over.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.880]  The kicker, picker, re-picker is in the books.
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:10.400]  Yep.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.660]  How's everyone feeling about their new teams?
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.940]  I think we should do a recap because I haven't...
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.240]  Because that was like an hour ago.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.180]  And who can remember?
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:19.720]  Uh, let's see.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:25.560]  Nick, you picked up Joey Sly, Austin Sieberts, and Will Lux.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.320]  Damn, Nick.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.300]  That's a real...
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.620]  You really improved your team.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.340]  I picked up Brandon McManus.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.920]  Jeff, you picked up Dustin Hopkins.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.160]  Andrew Pink...
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.040]  And Jason Sanders.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.840]  He chose him!
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:46.700]  Oh, I did?
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.300]  I don't even remember doing that.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.600]  That feels so long ago.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.100]  He stole him off my damn team.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.380]  Oh, I forgot about it.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.620]  Yeah, I did that, didn't I?
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:54.900]  Okay.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.500]  Yeah, it was nuts.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:57.860]  Two people!
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.820]  Two people in this recording!
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.460]  Dogfight over who got to pick him.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.320]  Gavin, you got Giants' Greg Joseph and Jets' Greg Zerline.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.140]  You got a Greg-heavy team.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.400]  I backed a couple of Gregs.
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:18.400]  Guys, what does this mean for the future of the Kicker Picker?
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:19.780]  So excited to find out.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.400]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.700]  How do you feel like this went?
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:27.080]  It's exactly what you thought it would be when you're watching this on your phone while you're
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:27.800]  making breakfast?
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.620]  Should we release this with a formal apology laugh?
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.860]  I think Andrew should have to record an apology.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:34.740]  Me?!
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:37.820]  You guys are spinning the wheel back and forth for 40 minutes!
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.300]  You brought in the wheel, you brought in stealing!
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.420]  We were just gonna pick!
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:45.540]  I brought in a wheel and then you put all the things on the wheel and then you said,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.660]  what a shit wheel!
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.280]  You're the one that put all the stuff!
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.540]  It went to shit the second Andrew wrote steal on the wheel.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.220]  Yep.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.000]  That's when it became a different game.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.200]  And in the end, a better game, I think.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.620]  I'm glad we did it.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:00.520]  Same.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.740]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760]  Yeah, I can't wait to have fajitas tonight, dude.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.280]  I'm trying to think about where to get them from.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.240]  Congratulations, everybody, on your fajitas.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.480]  Congratulations, Nick, on really becoming the best team overnight.
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.320]  I'm gonna be honest, I don't think I've ever had a fajita.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.040]  I don't think I've ever had a fajita and I need to figure out where to get fajitas from.
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.020]  That can't be true!
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.240]  I don't think I have.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.540]  Have you had Mexican food?
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.160]  Yeah, but I always go for a burrito or a quesadilla.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.760]  Okay, let's go for steak fajitas tonight.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.480]  Can I just ask before we go?
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.180]  What would everyone have put on the fourth wheel?
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.760]  Oh, that's tough.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.240]  I didn't even...
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.540]  Honestly, I kind of want to hold my cards to my vest so that way when we do this again next year,
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.680]  I have all my ideas fresh and they're coming out like big style.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.260]  You know what I mean?
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.920]  Next time we do anything, the wheels are going to show up.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:51.500]  I was hoping it would have five entries and they would all say,
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.600]  eat the pencil.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:53.820]  Oh, no!
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.400]  Wow!
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.660]  Oh my god, can you believe that's what might happen next time we do the kicker picker?
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.740]  It's been the re-picker.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.260]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.060]  Oh, the patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.260]  If for whatever reason, this whet your appetite and you said, I got to get...
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:18.180]  If you look for the, I survived the kicker picker re-picker shirt in the store soon.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.700]  Go subscribe to the channels.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.320]  Listen to the podcast.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.180]  See you next time.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:24.660]  Bye.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:25.580]  Bye.
