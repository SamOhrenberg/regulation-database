[00:07.000 --> 00:10.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,
[00:10.960 --> 00:14.180]  with mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea,
[00:14.520 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[00:19.680 --> 00:24.280]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.
[00:24.280 --> 00:29.140]  This is the new Star of the Seas. Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[00:54.280 --> 00:57.980]  It's a Gerpler flyer, because it's coming out this Friday, and also look,
[00:58.060 --> 01:01.120]  there's something on the back of it. We're doing a stream, apparently.
[01:01.920 --> 01:03.760]  Where did you get this flyer?
[01:04.240 --> 01:08.540]  I don't know. I was just looking in my room and I found this flyer. Look at this.
[01:08.800 --> 01:14.340]  We're apparently playing Mario Party at the Regulation Pod on Twitch at 10 a.m. at the
[01:14.340 --> 01:19.460]  same time, 10 a.m. Pacific, noon Central, and we're celebrating the Gerpler launch.
[01:19.900 --> 01:21.660]  Hey, Eric.
[01:22.240 --> 01:23.080]  Yeah, Gavin.
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.360]  Is this an announcement put on the front of an episode where, once again, we talked about this
[01:28.360 --> 01:32.920]  in the episode, in the same episode where I was complaining in the last episode, we talked about
[01:32.920 --> 01:33.600]  it in the episode?
[01:34.280 --> 01:34.560]  Yeah.
[01:35.120 --> 01:37.740]  Hey, that's crazy. That's also on this flyer.
[01:37.980 --> 01:38.280]  Holy shit.
[01:38.280 --> 01:42.260]  You know what else is on the flyer? If you look at the bottom, at the free guitar lessons,
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.240]  if you pull the phone number tab out, Eric's giving free guitar lessons.
[01:47.100 --> 01:47.580]  What?
[01:47.840 --> 01:49.160]  What's the phone number?
[01:51.320 --> 01:52.000]  250...
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.240]  RegulationsStore.Store.
[01:53.420 --> 01:56.080]  Whoa, we don't need to give a phone number.
[01:58.260 --> 01:58.940]  751...
[01:58.940 --> 02:02.000]  The phone number is RegulationsStore.Store.
[02:02.520 --> 02:09.340]  Oh, wow. That's great. So this Friday at noon, twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod to watch us
[02:09.340 --> 02:16.480]  stream Mario Party, the return of Dilkong, and the launch of the Gerpler at RegulationsStore.com.
[02:16.480 --> 02:20.720]  Now, listen to the episode where we talk about it in the episode and Gavin complains about it.
[02:20.800 --> 02:25.180]  But honestly, we had to do this also because for all the 10 of you who were like,
[02:25.340 --> 02:28.160]  I already knew this, there's a million who didn't. Thanks for listening.
[02:28.480 --> 02:33.300]  Oh, get away from me, guys. Oh, I'm going back in time. The time machine. I don't know where I'm
[02:33.300 --> 02:33.560]  going.
[02:35.020 --> 02:35.820]  Cut back.
[02:36.980 --> 02:38.640]  Eric, when can I schedule my lesson?
[02:41.340 --> 02:42.000]  Call me.
[02:44.140 --> 02:48.760]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. This is episode 28.
[02:48.960 --> 02:53.860]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Baddour, and Nick Schwartz.
[02:54.340 --> 02:54.740]  Hello.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.420]  Very special number.
[02:57.460 --> 03:00.020]  Does anybody remember the 28th birthday?
[03:00.600 --> 03:00.840]  No.
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.000]  Playing Minecraft.
[03:05.880 --> 03:08.740]  Yeah, no, I don't. Nothing stands out.
[03:10.060 --> 03:15.760]  Oh, I actually listened to last week's episode a little bit. I don't ever do that anymore.
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.200]  That's why I made that joke, because I...
[03:17.200 --> 03:21.420]  So that would have been 2016 for me. I could probably see if I took a picture that day.
[03:21.600 --> 03:22.380]  Dude, I bet you do.
[03:22.580 --> 03:30.840]  Oh, it was 2016 for Gavin. I'm trying to think, when did I turn 28? How old are you, Gavin?
[03:33.500 --> 03:33.860]  36.
[03:36.280 --> 03:38.460]  Okay, cool. So I'm two years older. Okay, cool.
[03:38.460 --> 03:40.580]  It's gonna be a long day.
[03:41.300 --> 03:41.900]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[03:42.440 --> 03:46.420]  You said it was 2016 when Gavin turned that age, and I just instantly went,
[03:46.560 --> 03:50.100]  okay, so I was 28 in 2016. Let's see.
[03:52.600 --> 03:56.220]  I immediately just went with like, okay, I guess we all were 28. I just was like,
[03:56.260 --> 03:58.100]  okay, 2016, 28 year. Okay, got it.
[03:58.740 --> 04:03.060]  I think it was 2003 for me, maybe, when I turned 28.
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.780]  Also known as 2016.
[04:05.340 --> 04:05.700]  I see.
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.900]  Yeah, the other 2016.
[04:07.900 --> 04:09.460]  So wait, who's wrong? Am I wrong?
[04:10.760 --> 04:10.940]  What?
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.080]  No, no, you're fine. It's that you said that, and then it just got us numbers confused.
[04:15.300 --> 04:16.120]  You're good, dude.
[04:16.300 --> 04:17.060]  Yeah, you're great.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.580]  Yeah. This is a rabbit on his heels, man. He doesn't know where to attack.
[04:24.980 --> 04:29.660]  I'm talking about a rabbit on his heels and attacking. Gavin has become a bookcase guy.
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.480]  We can't spend the whole of this episode talking about Gears of War again.
[04:33.580 --> 04:35.000]  No, I just did a quick mention.
[04:35.720 --> 04:36.080]  Okay.
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.660]  If there is a prompt on your screen, Eric, do you feel compelled to press it?
[04:43.140 --> 04:43.580]  What?
[04:43.920 --> 04:44.140]  Yes.
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.400]  Just because there's a prompt.
[04:46.220 --> 04:46.860]  He said yes.
[04:47.260 --> 04:48.440]  On a computer?
[04:49.140 --> 04:49.480]  Eric?
[04:49.600 --> 04:51.160]  No, let's say you're playing a game.
[04:51.620 --> 04:51.860]  Okay.
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.260]  And you walk into a room, and there's nothing in the room, but you get a prompt.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.640]  Do you have to hit it?
[04:59.060 --> 05:00.800]  You don't have to hit it. You should...
[05:00.800 --> 05:03.740]  Oh, like it says all of a sudden, it's like X button?
[05:03.740 --> 05:06.120]  There's just, yeah, like an X on your screen.
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.780]  Not like yelling, hey, push me, but just like, hey, you can hit it if you want type.
[05:10.780 --> 05:13.860]  Let's change this. Let's add to the stakes of this a little bit.
[05:13.960 --> 05:17.760]  Let's say you're three hours into a fight.
[05:18.900 --> 05:21.700]  And you finally beat the fight.
[05:22.100 --> 05:26.860]  You've been hitting your head pretty hard against this boss battle or sequence of battles for
[05:26.860 --> 05:28.480]  like two and a half to three hours.
[05:28.480 --> 05:35.080]  And then you finally, finally do it after so, so long.
[05:35.380 --> 05:37.080]  But let me add more. Let me add more to it.
[05:37.140 --> 05:39.180]  You've been hiding behind cover the whole game.
[05:39.540 --> 05:43.240]  There's little covers, there's upright cover, there's crouched down cover, right?
[05:44.500 --> 05:47.620]  Suddenly, towards the end of the game, in an end game scenario,
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.060]  there's a little icon on one of the covers.
[05:50.320 --> 05:52.800]  Okay, but before you continue, before you continue.
[05:53.080 --> 05:53.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:53.740 --> 05:57.920]  I just feel it's also important to note that all of the reasons you need cover have now been
[05:57.920 --> 06:00.660]  dealt with. All the cover no longer required.
[06:01.200 --> 06:03.460]  Because you've dealt with all the things that require the cover.
[06:03.780 --> 06:08.420]  All that needs to happen now is that we walk forward a few feet to collect a checkpoint
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.640]  so that we can bank that last three hours of misery.
[06:12.060 --> 06:12.460]  Sorry, continue.
[06:12.660 --> 06:15.400]  But, you know, new button just says, you know, just says X.
[06:15.940 --> 06:19.460]  It's like, ooh, X opens doors, X opens safes sometimes.
[06:20.400 --> 06:24.440]  Now, X drops a bookshelf on Andrew and kills him instantly!
[06:24.980 --> 06:26.260]  That's what X does!
[06:26.260 --> 06:31.000]  We finished everything, we're all good, and then Gavin walks into the room I've been in the whole
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.760]  time that I just have ignored the prompt for, and decides I gotta hit this prompt,
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.180]  and then he drops a bookcase on me, killing me, and we have to do it all over again.
[06:41.740 --> 06:44.160]  That's, to be fair, crazy timing, though.
[06:44.820 --> 06:48.360]  What do you mean? You walked into my area because it was clear,
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.280]  and then you dropped the bookcase on me,
[06:51.360 --> 06:54.740]  and then we spent 45 more minutes fighting things we'd killed.
[06:55.680 --> 06:58.440]  In fairness, I didn't see you, I just saw the prompt,
[06:58.760 --> 07:02.440]  and when I tipped the bookcase over, all I heard was a splash and a ton of blood.
[07:02.760 --> 07:04.260]  I didn't even see that you were there.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.800]  It was maybe the most defeated... oh, that's not true.
[07:11.020 --> 07:13.420]  There are other times where we're more defeated, but it was a bad one.
[07:13.500 --> 07:16.760]  I was up there, it was up there. It was unfortunate.
[07:17.280 --> 07:21.520]  And if that sounds like a nightmare to you, audience, well then buckle up,
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.120]  because that was only top five. There's at least four others just as bad.
[07:29.040 --> 07:31.500]  No, not my strongest series.
[07:32.540 --> 07:38.900]  Every time... so we haven't done much as a full group this week.
[07:39.340 --> 07:45.640]  Looking at the calendar, we had a sink on Monday, and then since then...
[07:45.640 --> 07:47.040]  Well, you and I had a meeting Tuesday, Eric.
[07:47.040 --> 07:53.520]  Yes, and then since then, as a full group, we have not done anything.
[07:53.640 --> 08:01.900]  However, every time I open Discord, you guys are recording gears. What the hell?
[08:02.460 --> 08:08.120]  We've been recording gears for like six hours a day, every day for the past two weeks.
[08:08.420 --> 08:09.300]  It's outrageous.
[08:09.840 --> 08:14.620]  Every day we finish, and I lay down, and I'm just wiped.
[08:14.620 --> 08:18.140]  And I'll typically have like a 45-minute nap,
[08:18.140 --> 08:21.320]  and then be confused as to how we're still in this day.
[08:21.620 --> 08:22.380]  It has been a toll.
[08:22.380 --> 08:24.100]  And then he'll text Gavin and I and go,
[08:24.200 --> 08:26.780]  I'm exhausted, and Gavin and I go, let's start again right now.
[08:29.380 --> 08:32.840]  I cannot get enough of that misery. I don't know why.
[08:34.100 --> 08:39.340]  Oh, it's brutal. But it's so much fun. We're close to the end. I can taste it.
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.320]  Well, we're past the end. Now we're close to the beginning.
[08:41.760 --> 08:42.960]  Yeah, we're close to the beginning.
[08:42.960 --> 08:48.360]  You guys talked about this earlier, where Jeff's like, yeah, we're done,
[08:48.480 --> 08:51.300]  like we beat it or whatever. And then I still don't understand.
[08:51.320 --> 08:52.440]  All I said was we beat it.
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.940]  I don't, I still don't understand what, so you're not, you beat it, but you're not done?
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.820]  Well, here, let me, this could be up to you, Eric. How do you find beat?
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.240]  Is beat finishing the last level, or is it finishing all parts of it?
[09:10.740 --> 09:15.360]  But what are you trying to accomplish? I don't know. Do you have to go backwards?
[09:15.700 --> 09:20.240]  What? Yes, because we started, we thought the highest difficulty was one thing.
[09:20.580 --> 09:26.340]  We completed Act One, Chapter One on Insane, which we thought was the hardest difficulty
[09:26.340 --> 09:33.120]  the game had. And then in the second episode we recorded, realized, oh, there is actually an even
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.820]  harder difficulty we could do. Let's do that. So we, none of us have the achievement for beating
[09:38.820 --> 09:42.940]  the game on the hardest difficulty because we still haven't done Act One, Chapter One.
[09:43.440 --> 09:47.680]  So we just got to go back and redo Act One, Chapter One, but we beat the game yesterday.
[09:48.180 --> 09:54.240]  Okay, okay. We did beat the game. That's some Andrew Brain stuff, by the way. That's the way
[09:54.240 --> 10:00.220]  the heists keep going, where they start and Gavin goes, did you put it on hard? And Andrew goes,
[10:00.760 --> 10:09.300]  uh, I forget. Yeah. Oh, no. But that'll be, you know, I see it. Jeff isn't out next week,
[10:09.380 --> 10:15.280]  but the week after he's out, we need to sync up and do the same for the heists. But isn't Nick out
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.380]  also? Uh, when are you on, Nick? Nick is only out like two days. You guys should hard heist the
[10:21.380 --> 10:26.420]  week I'm out. Yeah. Hell yeah. We'll only have three days of heisting, I think. Uh, there'll be,
[10:26.420 --> 10:31.540]  that's fine. Uh, you know, but, but I think we can. You put a solid six hours a day in,
[10:31.660 --> 10:35.140]  that's a lot of heisting. We can also heist. There's so much heisting we can do next week
[10:35.140 --> 10:41.640]  also. And that's true. And when this is out, we can't even do anything on Friday, the 22nd at
[10:41.640 --> 10:48.260]  noon because we're doing a Mario party, jamboree, 20 turn, uh, Gerpler Twitch stream for the reas-
[10:48.260 --> 10:53.260]  for the release of the Gerpler at, uh, regulationstore.com or regulationstore.store.
[10:53.860 --> 10:56.560]  Hell yeah, we are. Squeeze that into the episode. We got the Gerpler coming out,
[10:56.660 --> 11:00.780]  we got the Mario party stream. Is that the most turns, Gavin, in that one? 20 turns?
[11:01.940 --> 11:07.880]  I think 35 is the most turns, isn't it? Oh my Lord. Oh Jesus. I just assumed we were doing the
[11:07.880 --> 11:11.560]  most turns. I have no idea. You guys, you guys told me that you were doing 20 turns when I made
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.080]  the event forever ago, so. Okay. We can change it, but that's what, that's what you said. Do
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.000]  you think there's a battery in Canada strong enough to allow you to play 35 turns? I bought
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.780]  a new dock. I got the official cable as long, I will test it to make sure we're all good,
[11:25.900 --> 11:30.360]  but I don't think it should be an issue. I, by the way, found a video, uh, a picture of,
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.120]  that I took on my 28th birthday. And it's a picture of Jeremy's desk in Achievement Hunter
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.840]  without the legs on and his chair without the swivel base. That was, was that the one where
[11:42.840 --> 11:46.600]  we lowered or raised it? That was the lower, I guess? That was the lowered. Yeah. And then you
[11:46.600 --> 11:52.800]  saw that and thought, let's raise it. God, that was back. Man, budget was a dangerous thing at
[11:52.800 --> 11:57.760]  times. Well, the budget for lowering the desk was $0. So yeah, we've been, we made up for that one.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.800]  And the budget for raising the desk was like eight Ikea bookshelves, I think, the little
[12:02.800 --> 12:09.200]  end tables. We had the, we had the scissor lift at the office already. Okay. What was the budget
[12:09.200 --> 12:16.580]  for testing hot dogs and speed? Was that three desks? We had the desks, right? Testing hot
[12:16.580 --> 12:22.080]  dogs? Well, you put the hot dog on a desk and you raised it and the hot dog would move faster.
[12:22.280 --> 12:30.120]  Whatever the thing was. Hot dogs? Wasn't there a dog on the desk? Hey, Andrew, just checking.
[12:30.240 --> 12:37.520]  Are you okay? I said I wasn't already. Was there not a dog on, wasn't that the item that if on the
[12:37.520 --> 12:44.780]  desk, wasn't it just a wiener? Maybe it came from dogs? I mean, it was just, it was just us on the
[12:44.780 --> 12:50.440]  desk though, wasn't it? It became you guys, but I thought it was a dog thing at first. You had a
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.180]  hot dog on the desk. I don't know. Maybe, maybe you're right. I don't know. I just remember arguing
[12:56.180 --> 13:01.940]  with Gracie and Emily for a whole break. I remember you being right. And I thought it was a hot dog
[13:01.940 --> 13:08.980]  was the item that would accelerate. Now I'm, I'm looking at the thumbnail and it is not a hot dog
[13:08.980 --> 13:16.480]  on a desk. However, it is a Gavin on a desk, which I think is not a hot dog, but it is Gavin.
[13:16.960 --> 13:22.840]  So Gavin, can you confirm not a hot dog? Not a hot dog from my perspective. Okay. You know,
[13:22.900 --> 13:29.240]  it's funny that you guys are looking back at older content from that was face, right? Probably. Yeah,
[13:29.300 --> 13:34.160]  that had to be. Okay. Yeah. Because I was thinking to put this in the context of where we are in the
[13:34.160 --> 13:40.460]  universe right now. We just recorded about an hour ago, a piece of holiday supplemental that
[13:40.460 --> 13:44.580]  we have coming out in December, I would guess. Right. And so we took a little break so I could
[13:44.580 --> 13:48.320]  take the dog out to go potty. And while I was taking the dog out, I was trying to prepare for
[13:48.320 --> 13:54.840]  this podcast and it hit me. This is episode 28. I wonder, it's a shame I don't have time to go back.
[13:54.920 --> 14:00.560]  I'd love to listen to face episode 28 and see what we're talking about and then see if I could find
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.080]  something out of there to sneak into this conversation. But that just got me thinking,
[14:05.380 --> 14:11.200]  oh, we're at a point now where we've got 28 episodes of regulation that can directly compare
[14:11.200 --> 14:15.900]  to 28 episodes of our other show. All right. Interesting. You ready? Yeah. What's the
[14:15.900 --> 14:22.520]  descriptor? I'm all back slash the bat fiasco. Jeff, Gavin, and Andrew talk about Andrew being
[14:22.520 --> 14:30.220]  the most least prepared payoff to the ketchup bet, Jeff's bats and more. So this would have
[14:30.220 --> 14:38.900]  been at the time where Jeff, I think Jeff was cutting bats. Andrew was proclaiming that he was
[14:38.900 --> 14:47.740]  mostly back. Yeah. So it's a pretty, probably like pretty like lore heavy episode. See, yeah,
[14:47.740 --> 14:54.540]  is you had all the mini bats. Did he saw off the mini bats? Is that what he did with them?
[14:55.020 --> 15:01.200]  No, he sawed off regular bats. I sawed off the regular sized bats. The mini bats were first. The
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.280]  mini bats, what I did was I got a wood burner and I burned numbers into the bottom of each one.
[15:07.820 --> 15:12.920]  And then you convinced me somehow that they were coated in some sort of a lacquer that would kill
[15:12.920 --> 15:19.200]  me or smell bad. And I, it was unfortunately deep in the paranoid era. It was a very paranoid
[15:19.200 --> 15:24.940]  time in general. And so I was on edge. I was definitely on edge. You're going to light all
[15:24.940 --> 15:32.240]  the bats on fire. Dude, I forgot. I forgot about the paranoid era. The paranoid era was crazy.
[15:32.700 --> 15:38.080]  I've got some now I'm waiting on a 27 pound package from Andrew for some reason. And I'm
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.300]  kind of nervous as to what's in it. I heard it was your fault. 27 pounds a holiday cheer probably.
[15:42.300 --> 15:49.420]  Yeah, exactly. Speaking of content, this is content we just didn't do, not even from the past.
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.500]  I finally watched the Borderlands movie. We talked about doing content around it where we did
[15:55.500 --> 16:01.520]  like a draft of like based on our experience with the game, what we would anticipate being
[16:01.520 --> 16:06.860]  in a Borderlands movie. Like, what are the touchstones of that franchise that you would
[16:06.860 --> 16:12.120]  need to hit when adapting it? And I'm glad we did that only because none of us would have
[16:12.120 --> 16:17.320]  made any progress in the bingo of it. There's nothing to do any. There's not a single fucking
[16:17.320 --> 16:23.940]  thing from that game in that movie. It is insane. Every single game, like the thing I thought going
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.520]  into it is they're definitely going to do this. All of those games open with a music sequence
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.680]  with action happening in like slow motion. None of that. Just skipped it entirely.
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.060]  Not a single glowing gun. They don't even open a gear chest in the entire thing. Are you serious?
[16:40.860 --> 16:45.800]  Insane. I haven't, you know, I actually have 30 minutes left, so maybe they do in the final 30
[16:45.800 --> 16:53.960]  minutes. There is zero moments of a character opening a thing and thing shooting out of it
[16:53.960 --> 17:02.740]  is insane. I don't know who that movie was for. Very weird. I'm glad we didn't do it. I kind of
[17:02.740 --> 17:08.280]  want to do it for Minecraft because we've all played Minecraft, I believe. And that movie,
[17:08.280 --> 17:11.340]  I don't know. Once again, Jack Black. So I guess how could it go wrong?
[17:11.700 --> 17:15.040]  Speaking of speaking of Minecraft, I'm still holding on to Ratcraft as an idea.
[17:15.520 --> 17:23.660]  So what do you rate it? Two clap traps out of ten.
[17:24.540 --> 17:28.820]  Two out of ten clap traps. That's another weird thing they did where like they had
[17:28.820 --> 17:32.300]  Jack Black is the voice of Clap Trap and they really want you to know it's Jack Black,
[17:32.380 --> 17:35.240]  so it doesn't really sound like Clap Trap. It just sounds like Jack Black.
[17:35.240 --> 17:39.920]  Wow. It just sucks. That movie sucks. Does he say skadoosh a lot?
[17:40.700 --> 17:44.800]  I probably. It would fit with the Clap Trap character they're presenting.
[17:45.460 --> 17:49.340]  None of them have abilities. They're not. Fuck, it sucks. That movie sucks.
[17:50.500 --> 17:52.840]  How do you not have anything from the game in the movie?
[17:54.660 --> 17:59.680]  Insane. This is the first episode that's come out since the audience has seen the kicker,
[17:59.680 --> 18:06.620]  picker, re-picker, kicker, re-picker. And I love the perspective of fresh eyes because I didn't
[18:06.620 --> 18:11.160]  realize at the time or even when I was watching it back until the audience pointed out the fact
[18:11.160 --> 18:18.020]  that at no point on either of the second or third wheels did we have pick. Oh, yeah, that's insane.
[18:18.280 --> 18:22.000]  That is so funny. We had steal, but there wasn't anything on the wheel. That was kind of by design,
[18:22.080 --> 18:29.440]  wasn't it? Oh, yeah. I thought I thought the point of the other wheels was to get you down
[18:29.440 --> 18:33.800]  and out and then eventually you'd have to get back on the first. The second third wheel felt
[18:33.800 --> 18:38.620]  like punishment wheels to me. Yeah. At best, it was an erosion of progress. And at worst, it was a
[18:38.620 --> 18:43.420]  stark punishment. I'm just blown away. We didn't have force pick from the list on there. It should
[18:43.420 --> 18:47.660]  have been nuts. Oh, I see. That probably would have been really that probably would have been
[18:47.660 --> 18:52.760]  really smart. Yeah, that was really good. It would have been really good. Well, I feel like what got
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.100]  put on the wheel rolled away from me quickly. Like I opened up the back of the car that had
[18:58.100 --> 19:02.400]  the wheels and it rolled down a hill instantly and I never was able to catch up to it. I just
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.660]  thought I mean, it's your fault, though, right? Like I don't I still don't understand. You drove
[19:06.660 --> 19:11.980]  the car to the location. Yeah, there are movie where like a rogue tire starts killing people.
[19:12.460 --> 19:18.640]  I think it's just called wheel. I yeah, I think it's yeah. Or tire wheel tire. I think the wheel
[19:18.640 --> 19:26.540]  tire. I think it is called rubber. It's called rubber. Yeah. Rubber. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway,
[19:26.540 --> 19:33.240]  Andrew did that. Oh, I brought the wheel into the it's like I put the grenade in the room,
[19:33.400 --> 19:39.040]  but I'm not the one who pulled the pin. Do you think or rather not do? When do you think we'll
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.760]  see the wheel again? I don't know. I feel like you can't predict the wheel. It kind it has it
[19:43.760 --> 19:49.600]  kind of shows up on its own time, right? Yeah. If and when it feels it feels appropriate. Yeah,
[19:50.020 --> 19:54.620]  I want it to feel natural. We could I mean, you could put a wheel into anything and that's fun.
[19:55.500 --> 20:00.160]  It's got a it's got to be earned, I think. I feel like it has to be a spontaneous wheel.
[20:00.320 --> 20:04.080]  You know, I don't think you plan for a wheel. Oh, you can play for a wheel.
[20:04.820 --> 20:10.500]  Yeah. How'd that go for you? How'd that go for you? Once again, I would say that that was barely
[20:10.500 --> 20:14.880]  planned. The wheel really came into play because it's like how the what are they going to be the
[20:14.880 --> 20:22.260]  dynamics of this thing? Would a wheel in space ever stop spinning? Oh, no. Right. Like if you
[20:22.260 --> 20:27.920]  had a car, you had a car in space, you you floor it, you're like 100 miles an hour on your wheel
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.540]  and then you just pop the wheel off. I don't think it stops. I think it goes forever. That's
[20:32.540 --> 20:38.640]  something we could visit in the future, maybe. A spinnable wheel? I don't what how? What do you
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.860]  mean? A wheel that never stops? We go to space? Yeah. I'm not talking like episode 30. I'm
[20:43.860 --> 20:47.600]  talking about, you know, episode 700 or something. We could simulate space, right? Isn't there like
[20:47.600 --> 20:51.920]  planes that do that, that Tom Cruise was in? Mm hmm. Yeah, but they don't suck the air out,
[20:52.280 --> 20:57.180]  which I think is why a wheel wouldn't stop because there's no air resistance. I see. We'll just have
[20:57.180 --> 21:02.940]  to wait till we can go to space to try it. But put a pin in it for sure. We have to have a fan who's
[21:02.940 --> 21:08.780]  an astronaut, right? This podcast only attracts the smartest people. So take a wheel to space
[21:08.780 --> 21:12.020]  and spin it. We've had people that work at NASA. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. How hard could it be
[21:12.020 --> 21:16.660]  for them to throw a wheel in there? We're going to read an email next week that's going to be like,
[21:16.660 --> 21:20.440]  hey, Annegg, I just wanted to say on the International Space Station right now,
[21:20.560 --> 21:26.820]  love the episode. Gavin is correct. So would it ever land on Goat's third wheel?
[21:28.940 --> 21:35.620]  What if, what if someday we move past a wheel? What if there's a triangle or a square or an
[21:35.620 --> 21:42.660]  octagon? Well, a wheel isn't a circle. You could have a square wheel. Yeah. I see what you're
[21:42.660 --> 21:47.380]  saying. You want to get away from circles. Maybe someday we get away from a circle. Yeah.
[21:49.660 --> 21:55.120]  There's a lot of shapes out there. I just can't stop thinking about the scene in Gravity when
[21:55.120 --> 22:00.180]  the debris circles back around. That happening, but it's just Wheel of Fortune wheels. Just
[22:00.180 --> 22:04.060]  spinning wheels. Just ripping through shit. Someone could edit that in probably. Just
[22:04.060 --> 22:09.800]  wrecking all the parachute up in the space station. You see Bankrupt fly by the screen as
[22:09.800 --> 22:12.700]  shoves George Clooney in half. Vanna White goes by.

[23:10.820 --> 23:15.680]  Hey, I have a question. It's non-space or wheel related, but I guess it doesn't have to be,
[23:15.780 --> 23:20.120]  but I think it is in its current instance. Did we ever order those new puzzles?
[23:21.220 --> 23:21.960]  Yeah, I believe so.
[23:23.740 --> 23:27.340]  I'll double check. I don't remember if I did or not, honestly, because it was in the middle of
[23:27.340 --> 23:31.760]  trying to get all the CPA stuff done. No big deal if we didn't, but it popped into my head yesterday
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.020]  and I thought I should check on that. We definitely should do that still. Who is we?
[23:36.480 --> 23:41.440]  It's me, because that's an assigned thing to me. I thought about it earlier today because I got an
[23:41.440 --> 23:49.240]  email from Pomegranate about some puzzles that were coming out or whatever, and I put it on my
[23:49.240 --> 23:55.500]  list of like, ah f**k, I gotta remember to get to this. And don't worry, we'll definitely do times
[23:55.500 --> 24:00.840]  and it'll be really real this time, guys. It'll be really good. I've been looking at on the Xbox
[24:00.840 --> 24:06.700]  store if there are puzzle making games and there aren't, but there is a computer, a Windows puzzle
[24:06.700 --> 24:12.460]  thing. Puzzle making games? Yeah, like if there's just like a jigsaw game with a controller type
[24:12.460 --> 24:18.980]  thing. There isn't really on the store, but there is a Windows one on PC. So when you open a box
[24:18.980 --> 24:29.250]  and there's all the pieces, you're making a puzzle? Yeah. What do you mean? I just couldn't
[24:29.250 --> 24:33.290]  tell whether you were going to make a puzzle or like put together a puzzle. One and the same,
[24:33.410 --> 24:37.010]  is it not? He's like, are you creating a puzzle or assembling a puzzle? Yeah, yeah.
[24:38.390 --> 24:42.730]  I would never think of it that way, but fair enough. I see what you're saying. You would
[24:42.730 --> 24:49.270]  never think of it that way? I just, in my head, it's make a puzzle. It's like when you go to sleep
[24:49.270 --> 24:55.410]  and you say, I'm getting in bed. You're not getting in bed. Like sometimes you say, I'm
[24:55.410 --> 25:03.920]  going to go to sleep. But then sometimes you say, I'm going to make sleep. I wish I could make
[25:03.920 --> 25:11.760]  sleep right now. Attend some sleep. I'm going to make sleep. I feel like somebody... I'm going to
[25:11.760 --> 25:18.200]  make sleep would be the most badass fight promo of all time. A boxer in like the pre-fight press
[25:18.200 --> 25:23.540]  conference is like, I'm going to sleep on Saturday night. I'm going to create sleep with this fist.
[25:25.460 --> 25:32.580]  That would be so good. You think Mike Tyson makes Jake Paul make sleep?
[25:33.200 --> 25:37.840]  But I wish he would. I don't think so. I don't think any of that shit's ever going to be real.
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.700]  Jake Paul tricks us every time into thinking that somebody is going to kick his ass and then it's
[25:43.700 --> 25:49.240]  never going to happen. This would be the one. This would be the one and I'll be watching it. Fingers
[25:49.240 --> 25:57.220]  crossed. I want to see it. It's not going to happen. I want to see it so bad. What if he puts
[25:57.220 --> 26:06.840]  him in the shadow realm? What if he just does it? What if Mike Tyson banishes Jake Paul? I was
[26:06.840 --> 26:12.420]  watching some TikToks of Roy Jones Jr. doing an interview with somebody talking about his exhibition
[26:12.420 --> 26:17.840]  fight with Tyson. And it was so fucking cool to hear Roy Jones Jr., one of the greatest boxers
[26:17.840 --> 26:24.760]  of all time, who's like 44 and 4, I think, talk about how fucking scared he was of Mike Tyson
[26:24.760 --> 26:28.960]  and how he kept clinging on to him just because he was not going to let Mike uppercut him.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.800]  And just like about how he changed the way he boxed to make sure in the friendly exhibition
[26:34.800 --> 26:40.420]  that he didn't hit Mike the wrong way and give him the wrong idea. Like, it was really funny.
[26:41.160 --> 26:46.460]  That guy instills so much fear into the other best people who have ever done it. It's wild.
[26:46.460 --> 26:51.580]  So I think like the worst case scenario, and this is not, this is, I mean, the worst case
[26:51.580 --> 26:57.540]  is that Mike Tyson just gets knocked out and it's really sad. But this being a fight sort of like
[26:57.540 --> 27:02.280]  Anderson Silva and Sheil Sunen had a boxing match like six months ago. I didn't watch it.
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.060]  Was it good? No, no, it was really bad. It was one of those things where it's like, hey,
[27:06.080 --> 27:10.620]  this is like a fun, like it wasn't a real competition. It was an exhibition and they
[27:10.620 --> 27:15.700]  treated it as such. Neither of them really went their hardest in any way. And that's sort of
[27:15.700 --> 27:21.460]  the fear of this event of like, it doesn't really matter. It was so refreshing to hear
[27:21.460 --> 27:26.360]  Roy Jones Jr. being like, that was supposed to be the tone of our exhibition of like,
[27:26.380 --> 27:32.520]  let's just kind of box, like not go full on with each other. And Mike Tyson is not capable of that.
[27:32.740 --> 27:38.300]  Mike Tyson has one speed and it is trying to kill you. And it does not matter what the set
[27:38.300 --> 27:43.520]  dressing is around it. He's a sleepways making sleep. He immediately punched me in the chest
[27:43.520 --> 27:50.140]  and I went, oh God, it's going to be a long night. And it wasn't. That was a short fight.
[27:50.360 --> 27:54.840]  It was a short fight. And Roy Jones Jr. is my favorite boxer of all time. And it was,
[27:55.780 --> 28:00.020]  she was so clearly outclassed by Mike Tyson in that moment. Man.
[28:00.540 --> 28:06.360]  I'm excited mainly for that event because of what it represents for the future of Netflix.
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.600]  More live sports on Netflix. All about it. Very excited. I'm right there with you.
[28:12.120 --> 28:15.400]  That's their big push for next year. They just signed that WWE contract.
[28:16.760 --> 28:20.280]  Yeah, I feel like I'm going to watch the, I'm going to do the thing where I say I'm
[28:20.280 --> 28:23.900]  going to get into it and I just will never watch it. But I am currently thinking I'm
[28:23.900 --> 28:28.120]  going to watch because I think just having the option and it's right there, I think is the big
[28:28.120 --> 28:31.560]  thing. I tell you what, Andrew, if you want, I'll watch it with you. We'll have a watch party,
[28:31.680 --> 28:34.120]  you and me, because I was thinking the same thing. Do you want to do the first episode of Raw?
[28:34.780 --> 28:41.040]  Yeah, why not? Everybody keeps telling us to get into it and that we'll love it if we love sports.
[28:41.040 --> 28:43.480]  And so why not? Why not give it a shot? I'd like to watch it as a kid.
[28:43.880 --> 28:45.780]  I don't think you're going to love it. I don't think I will either,
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.880]  but I'm willing to give it a shot. You can't be scared to try stuff.
[28:51.280 --> 28:52.960]  No, totally. No, yeah, you're right.
[28:55.220 --> 28:58.960]  Speaking of like sports, I feel like understand the people that don't,
[28:59.020 --> 29:04.280]  like that hate sports can be an unwelcoming culture. But when you get to the like how
[29:04.280 --> 29:10.780]  ridiculous the people are that are in it and the stories around it is really like it adds a level
[29:10.780 --> 29:15.540]  of appreciation to me. That's where my love of sports is. Did you guys see Jerry Jones talking
[29:15.540 --> 29:24.220]  about the sun over the weekend? Nick, did you see his? You didn't see his. Nick's a Cowboys fan.
[29:28.360 --> 29:35.320]  Your stadium fucking sucks, Nick. The team does, too, because they can't fucking see.
[29:36.100 --> 29:41.180]  What happened with it? Okay, so this is Cowboys Stadium has a design flaw, Gavin,
[29:41.560 --> 29:49.620]  where it has these giant windows that like magnify the sun onto the field. And depending on,
[29:50.700 --> 29:55.660]  well, I guess they flip side. So both teams at a certain point in the game have a problem of they
[29:55.660 --> 30:02.240]  turn to look to catch the ball and they're just blinded by sun. They can't see it. But in Jerry
[30:02.240 --> 30:09.380]  Jones, the owner of the Cowboys loves this and thinks it's great. And he refuses to cover the
[30:09.380 --> 30:15.720]  windows, despite his star wide receiver saying we should cover the windows and they cover the
[30:15.720 --> 30:21.800]  windows for other events. Like they already have the things to cover the windows if they wanted to.
[30:22.040 --> 30:26.260]  He just thinks the death ray makes the game more exciting. He thinks it's an advantage for the
[30:26.260 --> 30:32.600]  team. Dude, they're dropping fucking wide open five yard passes in the end zone because they're
[30:32.600 --> 30:40.420]  blind. It's embarrassing. It sucks. It's gotten to a point where Travis Kelsey on his podcast with
[30:40.420 --> 30:45.920]  his brother started talking about it, and he said it appears that Jerry Jones is still at war with
[30:45.920 --> 30:52.640]  the sun. Oh, yeah, it's so good. He so it happened again. And their star receiver said, yeah, over
[30:52.640 --> 30:57.660]  the weekend, we should cover these. So at the press conference, Jerry Jones, who's the owner of
[30:57.660 --> 31:01.720]  the team, he's a billionaire. When I heard this quote, I did not believe it was real. And then I
[31:01.720 --> 31:06.400]  looked into it and confirmed he said all these things. Someone brought up the sun and he's just
[31:06.400 --> 31:10.200]  in a really cranky mood because the team is bad. He's trying to fire radio hosts for asking
[31:10.200 --> 31:15.920]  questions. It's great. Here's him discussing the sun when asked if it would be better if they
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.720]  cover the windows. Well, let's tear the damn stadium down and build another one. Are you
[31:20.720 --> 31:26.220]  kidding me? Everyone has got the same thing. Every team that comes in here has the same issues.
[31:26.520 --> 31:31.240]  I'm saying the world knows where the sun is. You get to know that almost a year in advance.
[31:31.660 --> 31:35.000]  Someone asked me about the sun. What about the sun? Where's the moon?
[31:37.520 --> 31:43.180]  What? Where's the moon? I've been laughing so hard at where's the moon for days all week.
[31:43.340 --> 31:49.620]  Where's the moon? What? When when he was asked about the sun, he said it's the largest air
[31:49.620 --> 31:56.540]  conditioned space in the world. What does that have to do with the sun? So everyone's cool, but
[31:57.760 --> 32:02.860]  blind. Yeah, it's very it's very comfortable inside. It's comfortable and you can't see shit.
[32:03.340 --> 32:09.300]  Yeah, but where's the moon? Where's that going to be? Where's the moon? They know where the sun's
[32:09.300 --> 32:13.300]  going to be a year in advance. They do. We know where the sun's going to be when we decide to
[32:13.300 --> 32:17.200]  flip the coin or not. We do know where the damn sun is going to be in our own stadium.
[32:17.200 --> 32:23.580]  He just doesn't want to admit it's a bad design. Billionaires are so weird. It's like, yeah,
[32:24.060 --> 32:27.580]  you as as people get more money, they get less relatable when it comes to, like,
[32:27.600 --> 32:31.220]  buying things and stuff. And then as they hit that 10th figure of net worth,
[32:31.700 --> 32:35.680]  they just start to sound like aliens. Like that even makes sense to regular humans.
[32:36.180 --> 32:42.660]  It's because they get too rich to be wrong. Oh, it's great. It's so fun. It was a great
[32:43.200 --> 32:48.280]  it was a whole thing at the NFL. There was also a coach that like their coach got fired and they
[32:48.280 --> 32:53.460]  brought in a replacement. And he was talking about is like they got is the Saints coach
[32:53.460 --> 32:59.600]  and they got an upset win. And it's his first press conference as a coach. He's like, I got
[32:59.600 --> 33:04.320]  to tell you guys something started today, went to the coach's area, coaches, coach's bathroom,
[33:04.380 --> 33:09.540]  never been there before. Clogged the toilet. That was the start. He just went deep on how
[33:10.060 --> 33:13.420]  clogged the toilet. And it's like, it's not going to be a good day.
[33:14.320 --> 33:19.380]  Clogged that shit immediately. And then that his whole left side of his body went numb because one
[33:19.380 --> 33:23.680]  of his players hit him in the back to celebrate the win. And it locked everything. It's great.
[33:25.440 --> 33:30.000]  Well, what's going on? It's sports, man. Sports is fucking awesome.
[33:30.780 --> 33:32.860]  I'm sad we never had that kind of thing happen in Griffpool.
[33:34.800 --> 33:38.600]  Somebody saying, where's the moon or someone clogging the toilet before?
[33:38.600 --> 33:41.740]  There's a lot of toilets getting clogged in Griffville. Don't worry about that.
[33:44.060 --> 33:47.640]  Hey, I have a story to tell you guys before we wrap up the episode today.
[33:48.740 --> 33:51.380]  You guys remember I went out of town over the weekend? Yes.
[33:52.940 --> 34:00.200]  I went down to Galveston to a little boutique hotel. One of my wife's friends was having
[34:00.200 --> 34:06.920]  like a little like she has like a boutique clothing brand. And so she had like a pop-up
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.940]  over there. And my wife wanted to go down and support her. And it was, I guess, a good
[34:11.640 --> 34:14.840]  excuse to have a weekend away. And I hadn't been to Galveston since I was in like middle school.
[34:15.860 --> 34:22.400]  And so we drove down there in Emily's car. Totally fine. Had a fine weekend. It rained all weekend.
[34:22.780 --> 34:30.500]  And I found out that Emily's idea of a party is continues to be educational. We went to a
[34:31.860 --> 34:35.580]  the first place we could get a tour of and went to a tour of an old
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.400]  house. Not a lot going on in Galveston. So they're like, this old house. And you're like,
[34:41.460 --> 34:44.060]  oh, cool. What's the significance of it? And they're like, well, it's very old.
[34:44.940 --> 34:48.600]  And over here, you can see there's a room and that people get stuff here. And then
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.320]  and you're like, why was it built? And they're like, because the people that owned it were rich.
[34:52.480 --> 34:55.260]  And you're like, OK, were they pillars of the community? And they're like,
[34:55.380 --> 34:58.080]  no, they were in the community, you know, but they were mostly just rich.
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.360]  And the house is still here. Anyway, that'll be fifteen dollars. You know,
[35:01.360 --> 35:08.100]  it was like one of those kind of things. It was very fun, though. And so we get up Sunday morning
[35:08.100 --> 35:13.960]  to leave having had to about a day and a half in Galveston, which, as it turns out, is the exact
[35:13.960 --> 35:20.040]  right amount of time to spend in Galveston. And see, Nick knows. And so we get up to leave and
[35:21.300 --> 35:25.840]  the tire pressure sensor comes on on our car and it says that I need to air up our tires.
[35:26.460 --> 35:30.400]  No big deal. So I drive to a gas station and I put a little bit of air into our tires to get
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.540]  ready for the drive. It's about a three and a half hour drive home, I would say, from Galveston.
[35:35.300 --> 35:40.080]  And it's just on like the other side of Houston. And as soon as I put the air in the tires,
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.860]  get back in the car, turn it on. The check engine light comes on and I go, that's weird.
[35:45.980 --> 35:49.800]  Look, the check engine light just came on, like the tire sensor gauge went off and the check engine
[35:49.800 --> 35:52.700]  light went on. And Emily's like, that's weird. And I was like, it wasn't like that all weekend.
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.600]  No, haven't seen it. Hasn't been like that lately. No. And I thought, OK, strange. Turn the car off,
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.900]  turn it back on. Check engine lights on again. It doesn't give any indication of what it is.
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.740]  And this is like a it's annoying because the car tells you what wheel is has low pressure and what
[36:06.740 --> 36:11.520]  the pressure is. The car's like your front left tire has 25 psi in it. Fix it. But I can't tell
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.640]  you anything better than an unspecified problem in car. You know, it told you which engine.
[36:17.360 --> 36:20.220]  It did tell me which engine. It did tell me which engine, the only engine.
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.980]  And so I thought, that's strange. Let's just see how it drives. And so we pull out and we drive
[36:25.980 --> 36:31.340]  and it's going fine. And then I realize I'm having trouble accelerating. Like it's really
[36:31.340 --> 36:35.460]  chugging and I'm just in little, you know, neighborhoods essentially. And so we see an
[36:35.460 --> 36:40.100]  auto zone. We pull over to the auto zone because I didn't know this. Emily knew this. If you go
[36:40.100 --> 36:42.840]  inside, they have a little machine that'll come out and they can plug it into your car and they
[36:42.840 --> 36:46.940]  tell you what's wrong with your car. And so we had the auto zone guy come out and he plugged it
[36:46.940 --> 36:50.460]  in and he collected the data and he went inside and he looked it up. And by the way, it's Sunday
[36:50.460 --> 36:56.280]  morning. It's probably 7 a.m., maybe 8 a.m. because auto zones open at 8.15 a.m. We were
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.140]  trying to get an early start. Had to pick Albert up, you know, from the borders at the end of the
[37:01.140 --> 37:06.720]  day. And so he plugs it into the computer and he gets the printout and he says, oh,
[37:06.740 --> 37:13.840]  you have a fuel rail sensor that is malfunctioning. There's nothing wrong with your car.
[37:14.700 --> 37:18.820]  It's just this sensor's bad. And I go, oh, is that a hard thing to fix? And he goes,
[37:18.820 --> 37:21.680]  it's actually not a hard thing to fix. I've done it before with a friend of mine,
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.180]  takes about an hour and a half. It's hard to get to, but it's not hard to replace.
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.000]  And I go, what happens if I just drive with it? And he goes, oh, you can drive. It's not bad.
[37:30.100 --> 37:33.600]  It's just your car won't go very fast. And I was like, OK, cool.
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.400]  So it just regulates how much fuel your engine's getting or something?
[37:36.540 --> 37:40.620]  I guess something like that. Yeah. And so I go, well, do you guys have one? And he goes,
[37:40.640 --> 37:43.580]  well, let me see. And he's like, no, we don't have one in stock. Let me see. No,
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.100]  nobody in town has one. You're going to have to go to the dealership to get it. But in Texas,
[37:48.100 --> 37:52.080]  all dealerships are closed on Sunday. So he's like, so that's going to be Monday morning.
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.080]  So if you want to get it fixed here, you're going to have to spend another day in Galveston,
[37:56.140 --> 37:59.240]  essentially. And that is a nonstarter for Emily and I. We're not spending another fucking second
[37:59.240 --> 38:06.000]  in Galveston. And so we're like, well, we talk about it and we go like, what do you want to do?
[38:06.060 --> 38:11.300]  You want to try to... it's not dangerous to drive it other than it's slow. And I was thinking like,
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.320]  I don't want to be stuck in Galveston, even if we could just get... it's like 250 miles.
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.840]  Even if we could just get like within 100 miles of home and the car broke down or whatever,
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.120]  I could at least get it towed back to Austin. We'd at least be on the other side. We'd be
[38:23.120 --> 38:27.780]  closer to home, you know? Even if I had to just tow to the closest dealer at that point,
[38:27.820 --> 38:31.900]  it'd be way easier for us to deal with than having to... because I was thinking I could rent a car,
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.440]  leave the car here, rent a car, drive home, then come back and deal with it or take a flight home
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.920]  or, you know, there's all kinds of options. But we decided, fuck it. We're adventurous. Let's drive.
[38:42.800 --> 38:49.600]  So Emily mapped us home on not using interstates or highways, so just streets.
[38:49.840 --> 38:50.600]  Because you're too slow?
[38:50.920 --> 38:56.900]  Because we're too slow. And so we take off. And boy, were we slow. I collected some data
[38:56.900 --> 39:04.780]  to give you guys an idea of how slow I was. Let's see. My car maxed out at 49 miles an hour.
[39:04.780 --> 39:11.160]  I assumed 50 was one too much. That must've been where the regulator came in.
[39:11.360 --> 39:18.120]  To go from zero to 49 miles an hour in my wife's car took a minute and 17 seconds.
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.460]  So it took us six hours to drive home.
[39:25.460 --> 39:34.920]  Oh my Jesus Christ. I learned to fear and hate any grade of hill in front of me.
[39:36.100 --> 39:43.040]  Every time we hit a hill, I would look down and the route timer would instantly go up two minutes.
[39:43.220 --> 39:48.340]  Like a second I hit the incline, it would add two minutes to the trip. Every time we would sometimes
[39:48.340 --> 39:52.560]  because you're going downhill, you can coast. So I could get up to like 70 miles an hour on some roads.
[39:52.560 --> 39:57.240]  But so like every once in a while you get up to like 70 and then you hit a hill, no matter how
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.640]  fast you hit a hill. By the time you get to the top of that hill, you're going 18 to 22 miles an hour.
[40:03.420 --> 40:12.440]  So I had a line of cars behind me. It looked like the longest funeral procession in the history of
[40:12.440 --> 40:20.360]  the planet Earth. From Galveston to Austin on back roads. And if I was going fast, it's
[40:20.360 --> 40:27.420]  49 miles an hour is fine if you're going. But every time I had to stop at a stop sign or a
[40:27.420 --> 40:37.460]  stoplight, it was an unmitigated misery. I cannot explain to you the pain that I felt in my balls
[40:37.460 --> 40:45.760]  and my throat at the same time. Every time I had to accelerate and it took me a minute and 17 seconds
[40:45.760 --> 40:52.540]  to get to 49. And then there are some areas of Central Texas or East Texas where you'll
[40:52.540 --> 40:58.000]  hit a stop sign every 30 fucking feet. You're just going like two miles an hour. And it's just
[40:59.740 --> 41:05.460]  and me just waving people around and having my turn, having my fucking flashers on and
[41:05.460 --> 41:12.240]  begging people to go around for God's sakes. Six hours to get home. Got home.
[41:12.960 --> 41:20.080]  Get this. I just happened to look at the clock. It's 313 the exact fucking time that Howard Stern
[41:20.080 --> 41:25.320]  woke me up in the morning that night when I prayed for some sort of an insight into my life. Why was
[41:25.320 --> 41:31.520]  it 313 when I got home after that nightmare? Is the universe telling me to move to fucking Michigan
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.780]  because that's the area code or what is going on? But I'm getting the message loud and clear.
[41:36.780 --> 41:43.780]  Holy shit. Never, never drive from point A to point B at 49 miles an hour if it's longer than
[41:43.780 --> 41:52.280]  seven minutes. What a nightmare. I had insane. I had so funny being slow. Instead of fast and
[41:52.280 --> 41:58.200]  furious, you were slow and irate. Like there's nothing exciting happening. Just like I can't
[41:58.200 --> 42:01.640]  even tell you what it's like. Emily would be like, do you want to pull over and we'll switch? And I'm
[42:01.640 --> 42:06.360]  like, no, I don't want to stop. I don't want to get out of the car. I just we're going to drive
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.940]  until we get home. Zero brakes. I raw-dogged it. We didn't, there was no point. We just went from
[42:12.940 --> 42:20.780]  point A to point B as slow as Christmas, but we did it. And oh my God, was it a new kind of stress
[42:20.780 --> 42:25.180]  in my life? I wonder if there was like a tech menu or something you could have got into that just
[42:25.180 --> 42:32.300]  bypassed the sensor somehow. I don't know, man. What's nice about your setup is you two could
[42:32.300 --> 42:36.840]  have swapped seats without having to stop the car. You could have just got out and walked around
[42:36.840 --> 42:45.500]  it and then just sat back down and re-belted. That's so funny. Oh my God. Hitting a stop sign
[42:45.500 --> 42:52.440]  constantly. Oh yeah. And then the next day I had to drive Emily's car to the dealership
[42:52.440 --> 42:59.520]  in Austin traffic at 6 p.m., which was a whole other kind of just fucking insane nightmare
[43:00.040 --> 43:07.360]  to experience, but I was able to. That is hilarious. I would be so anxious going so
[43:07.360 --> 43:13.760]  slow, cars lining up behind me. Oh, it was unbelievable. Unbelievable. I love that you
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.980]  just pushed through there. Yeah. I mean, what are the alternatives, right? Like either way,
[43:19.980 --> 43:24.780]  I didn't want to be tied to Galveston. I didn't want to, I don't want to be stuck there any longer
[43:24.780 --> 43:31.440]  than I was. And I certainly didn't want to have to leave and come back, you know? And I just
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.320]  figured if I could get like closer to halfway, then everything flips. If I'm closer to Austin
[43:37.320 --> 43:40.800]  than further, then I can even take an Uber home an hour and a half if I need to. You know what
[43:40.800 --> 43:43.860]  I mean? Like I, I wanted to get home, wanted to get home to the dog who was for some reason
[43:43.860 --> 43:48.820]  barking in the background. Uh, I, I, I didn't want to be there anymore. You could have probably
[43:48.820 --> 43:54.340]  pushed the car faster. And some of those stop sign points, dude, dude, you are not kidding,
[43:54.540 --> 44:00.220]  man. Just throw it neutral. Just shove. There was a point in some, just outside of Galveston early
[44:00.220 --> 44:05.260]  onto the trip. Cause we were basically, you know, we're just taking back roads where I had to start
[44:05.260 --> 44:13.520]  at a hill. It's a bridge and I, we must've gone 11 miles an hour over that bridge because we just
[44:13.520 --> 44:17.980]  never had a chance to build up any momentum before we hit the incline. Uh, it was like the bridge
[44:17.980 --> 44:21.440]  started right after the stop sign. And I just remember thinking like, this is going to be the
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.100]  next like a hundred hours of my life. And then luckily it got a little bit better after we got
[44:25.100 --> 44:32.960]  over that bridge, but man. Oh, it's, I can't stop thinking about the montages and the early Fast and
[44:32.960 --> 44:37.060]  Furious movies when they'd flip the switch and the nitrous would go off and it'd go like through
[44:37.060 --> 44:41.620]  the tubes and fire would shoot out just that. And then cutting your car going 40.
[44:42.860 --> 44:47.060]  It's just like CG's through all the menu and the piping and the engines and it's just like,
[44:47.340 --> 44:56.000]  a sensor's like boop. It doesn't work. Oh, that's so funny. Did you, is it fixed now or what?
[44:56.300 --> 44:59.820]  It's at the dealer. I think it'll be fixed tomorrow. I think we're picking it up tomorrow.
[45:01.120 --> 45:04.760]  Um, it's just, they were like, yeah, it's not, it's just the sensor. It's not hard to fix. It's
[45:04.760 --> 45:07.580]  just, but they're like, it's, we got to get under the engine to fix it. So it's going to be a while.
[45:08.200 --> 45:12.360]  They'll get to it. So you're now in the mindset if you want just like an old fashioned car that
[45:12.360 --> 45:19.220]  you could fix yourself? I mean, maybe. I've always kind of lived in that mindset. Um,
[45:19.220 --> 45:24.120]  but I'm definitely closer to it now. For sure. Every problem that Emily's had in that car has
[45:24.120 --> 45:29.540]  been sensor related and she's had a few and I'm just fucking sick of it. Like I had, they really
[45:29.540 --> 45:34.980]  pissed me off to know that there was zero wrong with the car and it was acting up, you know,
[45:34.980 --> 45:42.360]  like I was suffering for six hours because I $9 widget burned out, you know, but the mechanics of
[45:42.360 --> 45:45.880]  the car are a hundred percent fine. And it did make me think like, I know it's impossible, but
[45:45.880 --> 45:50.460]  God, there should be some sort of a manual override, you know? I wonder if driving for six
[45:50.460 --> 45:58.080]  hours with like a fuel starved engine was good for the engine or not. Oh, so interesting. Interesting.
[45:59.100 --> 46:03.620]  We averaged, uh, six and a half miles a gallon better than normal.
[46:05.620 --> 46:11.540]  Saved gas doing it. We got home and less than a half a tank of gas. Uh, and oh, I also, I looked,
[46:11.640 --> 46:17.420]  uh, because I had a, you know, the odometer kept statistics. The average speed from start to finish
[46:17.420 --> 46:23.300]  was 43 miles an hour. Wow. Yeah. So I kept it almost at max speed of 49 the whole time.
[46:23.300 --> 46:27.940]  Now imagine if they broke it the other way where it doesn't go below 90.
[46:28.460 --> 46:33.600]  It starts not, it's just super fast. Then I'd be Keanu Reeves and I'd get home super quick.
[46:36.700 --> 46:45.280]  Yeah. You had the opposite of speed. Yeah. No speed, no slow, only speed like Sonic, but the car
[46:45.860 --> 46:52.300]  just can't. Oh, um, anyway, that's what, that's why I couldn't, uh, I had to figure out how to get
[46:52.300 --> 46:58.040]  the, uh, care packages around town the other day. Yeah. It was the thing where I asked Jeff,
[46:58.060 --> 47:01.720]  if you wouldn't mind dropping something off for me for something related to the show.
[47:02.700 --> 47:07.500]  And, uh, he said he didn't have a car, but I knew you went to Galveston. And so it was like,
[47:07.940 --> 47:14.140]  oh, I cannot wait. I was like, I can't, but I can't tell you why. Yeah. That's so funny.
[47:15.360 --> 47:20.440]  Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?

[47:47.880 --> 47:52.720]  blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic blended iced coffee, you know and love. Now
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.020]  topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam available for a limited time.
[47:58.240 --> 48:03.680]  Your strato frappuccino is ready at Starbucks. Uh, before we should bring it up, before we
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.340]  move on from this episode, I gotta, I gotta figure out what my throat goat rating is.
[48:08.920 --> 48:14.340]  We're doing the Gerplers come out and you guys did your own throat goats in the new Gerplers.
[48:14.740 --> 48:17.380]  Yeah. Did you watch the video? I haven't seen it yet. No. So I don't know the
[48:17.380 --> 48:23.440]  measurements. I felt like going in dark, uh, would be best for this. Okay. Well,
[48:23.480 --> 48:30.640]  do you have a Gerpler, uh, in front of you? I do. Yes. What color is it? Uh, it is the green
[48:30.640 --> 48:35.500]  Gerpler. Oh, perfect. That's great. That's what we use. That's fantastic. It wasn't going to be able
[48:35.500 --> 48:43.200]  to be, uh, an official, uh, yeah. Does anyone have the ability to take a screenshot from that video
[48:43.200 --> 48:48.300]  of the final lines? And we can put that up after Andrew tells us his. I, I think, I think I can,
[48:48.380 --> 48:53.620]  after we get it from Andrew, I think I can do it. Let me, I have a measuring cup to be very specific
[48:53.620 --> 48:58.700]  as well. Oh, we weren't very specific. Yeah. We don't know. Right. But what we did, let me explain
[48:58.700 --> 49:05.600]  to you what we did. We put as much water in our mouth, it was individual. So like say Gavin would
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.360]  go, he'd put as much water as he could physically hold in his mouth, gullet, throat, et cetera.
[49:11.900 --> 49:20.520]  As much as he could physically hold. Then he would spit it into the measuring cup.
[49:21.280 --> 49:27.540]  And then from the measuring cup into, we would pour it into the Gerpler and then we would mark
[49:27.540 --> 49:32.280]  a line on the Gerplers. That, that, that's the way that went, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,
[49:32.400 --> 49:40.140]  so from there, what I need you to do is make a line next to, I'm, I'm watching the video now,
[49:40.140 --> 49:46.220]  next to the letters, like by like the Gerpler, like not on top of the white letters, but right
[49:46.220 --> 49:50.380]  next to it, make a little black mark and then send us the picture. That's what we're looking at.
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.060]  Okay. Well, I'm going to first put the water in the mouth. Got to stretch the cheeks out a little
[49:56.060 --> 50:00.220]  bit. Yeah. You know, are you doing, are you doing cold water, hot water? What are you doing?
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.460]  Uh, poured out cold. I'd say room temp. Okay. Okay. Probably spot. Well, I mean,
[50:06.460 --> 50:16.400]  I'm a little cheek stretch. Yeah. I make sure we got room. Okay. Here we go.
[50:19.400 --> 50:21.200]  Imagine it's going in now.
[50:25.180 --> 50:31.300]  Make a lot of sounds. Lots of choking noise. Is he going to try and squeeze a bit more in?
[50:31.760 --> 50:34.500]  Yeah. I think he's done it. Yep.
[50:41.140 --> 50:50.200]  Oh my God. You can hear it. Oh, sorry. Sound like you got a lot in. I kept,
[50:50.880 --> 50:55.540]  I'd fill my mouth and then I just instinctually start drinking it a little bit. And then I'd go,
[50:56.020 --> 50:59.480]  oh, there's more room. There's more room. I think everyone did that in our main video.
[50:59.600 --> 51:09.640]  Okay. Pouring it in. Let me first just see how much it is in the cup. Interesting.
[51:09.900 --> 51:16.080]  Okay. Andrew, do you have any predictions on where you'll rank within the group?
[51:16.960 --> 51:23.760]  I think I'm going to be at the bottom. Oh, big back, small mouth. Yeah.
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.320]  I think I have a small mouth. Would you say your throat is petite?
[51:31.960 --> 51:38.500]  Yeah. I think I do have a petite throat. Okay.
[51:41.460 --> 51:50.600]  You make sure this is level. I don't even need to mark. It's so perfect for where mine is.
[51:51.220 --> 51:56.660]  Okay. Which also makes me feel like I'm very low. I just, I hope, I hope it's like at the L.
[51:59.940 --> 52:02.840]  Yeah, guys, I'm only into the middle of the U.
[52:03.220 --> 52:14.280]  Uh, my bar directly touches the first R. Okay. Could you soy phone it?
[52:15.260 --> 52:23.160]  Uh, yeah. One sec. Let me take a, oh, that's uh. Now, if you, Eric, if you haven't already taken
[52:23.160 --> 52:26.540]  a screenshot, I can just. I already have it. Oh, okay. I was going to say, I have the Gerpler,
[52:26.620 --> 52:32.000]  I can just go grab it. Oh, Jeff, you fool. I have it. I'm ready to share.
[52:32.840 --> 52:39.480]  I'm uploading the photo right now. Okay. Excited to see it. Yeah, as am I. Did you, so, okay.
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.260]  Oh, kind of weird that it's at an angle. Might be the angle, but that's the worst photo I've ever
[52:45.260 --> 52:49.340]  seen. I mean, uh, I mean, kind of like, kind of like the most insane way you could have taken that
[52:49.340 --> 52:53.340]  picture. How would I, what would be the better way to do it? Here, let me show you. Yeah, please.
[52:53.860 --> 53:05.780]  Full on. Just straight on. So, Andrew is, is just under Gavin and I. Yeah. So, so the G that's all
[53:05.780 --> 53:11.540]  the way to the left is Gavin. The G that's all the way to the right is Jeff. Yeah, I'm definitely
[53:11.540 --> 53:15.840]  below. I'm not, it's like barely touching here. Let me. Yeah. So now we've got full Genga.
[53:16.420 --> 53:21.740]  We're Genga. We got full Genga. Our mouths are Genga. I don't know about that. I don't know
[53:21.740 --> 53:29.060]  if I like that one. We should make a board game called Genga. Genga mouth. Oh. We could be the
[53:29.060 --> 53:34.320]  next Smash Mouth. Here we go. Better angle for you guys. I thought I did a good job. Apparently
[53:34.320 --> 53:43.870]  I didn't. People are picky nowadays. It's the photography. Yeah. Do you see the difference
[53:43.870 --> 53:48.190]  between what you did the first time and what you did the second time? Phenomenal. The water level
[53:48.190 --> 53:53.590]  is now, we can see how much further below it is. It's essentially the same. I'm excited for the
[53:53.590 --> 53:59.010]  You're dead, Andrew. I think you're dead last. Yeah, I'm definitely last. I think so. Wow. Yeah,
[53:59.010 --> 54:05.810]  not even close, buddy. You got your puzzle under the laptop. We talked about this before.
[54:06.850 --> 54:14.250]  Move my norm movies. Ventilation isn't as good with the puzzle. It still overheats.
[54:17.110 --> 54:25.820]  Have you tried it just on the desk? No. Why did you give such a big,
[54:25.820 --> 54:28.940]  you don't want it just on the desk? You like saving the desk or what?
[54:30.020 --> 54:36.000]  I was thinking why I haven't done that. That was the thing of like, no, I haven't done that.
[54:36.020 --> 54:40.980]  And why? Because there has to be a reason. At the laptop store, like, where's all the platforms and
[54:40.980 --> 54:45.600]  boxes and puzzles and shit to put this on? OK, so I think this is what happened. I'm now
[54:45.600 --> 54:51.480]  remembering the sequence of events that led to this moment. I originally was level on the desk
[54:51.480 --> 54:55.860]  and then it was really overheating and I thought maybe some elevation would help it.
[54:56.520 --> 55:02.000]  So then I put the norm DVDs under it. Then I wanted to take the norm DVDs back and I got
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.260]  the puzzle box and I I think I just I just swapped it because I had something there before.
[55:08.720 --> 55:12.600]  I don't think it has to be on this. When you type on it, though, doesn't it just go like
[55:13.020 --> 55:17.720]  like bouncing all around? What do you mean? Because you're balancing it.
[55:18.620 --> 55:24.080]  Well, no, it's the puzzle box is essentially the same size as the laptop. You can see the
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.680]  giant overhang. Oh, well, I don't use the right side of the keyboard that much, I guess. I don't
[55:30.680 --> 55:34.160]  know. Yeah, I'm not typing all the way on the edge. It's more middle.
[55:38.140 --> 55:42.420]  I'm constantly not using the question mark. So, I mean, that's just over there. Yeah,
[55:42.420 --> 55:45.580]  I'm looking at where the line is on the puzzle box to the keys,
[55:45.580 --> 55:49.560]  and it is halfway through the inner key on the right. So it's OK. I just like the
[55:49.560 --> 55:52.960]  idea of being like, oh, I can't ask any questions because my laptop will fall over.
[55:55.920 --> 56:02.240]  No, but I'm improving. I plugged in my external drive and I transferred all of the stuff onto it
[56:02.240 --> 56:08.440]  and then deleted all my computer. I'm learning. Oh, yeah, dude. I know how to do stuff. Yeah.
[56:08.980 --> 56:12.540]  I mean, I would say that's a concept that also works outside of computers.
[56:12.980 --> 56:17.540]  Yeah. Like what? Like storing something in like a cupboard or something.
[56:18.560 --> 56:23.740]  Well, yeah, he's got you there. Yeah, I don't I don't understand. Like something that was out
[56:23.740 --> 56:27.360]  and you were using and then it's like, oh, I don't need that anymore. So I put it away. Yeah.
[56:29.780 --> 56:34.360]  I don't get it. What's the implication that I don't? No, they're just that's what you're doing
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.140]  with files. You're making it sound like you just learned about copying files onto an external drive.
[56:39.820 --> 56:46.640]  Yeah, well, I've never done it before. OK, so he did just learn about it. Yeah. I thought that
[56:46.640 --> 56:52.800]  when it happened and I moved it, I didn't realize a copy. Hey, good job, man. I don't know why Gavin's
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.440]  criticizing you. I'm happy you did it. I think it's one of those things where I'm not I'm trying
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.740]  to be less on the attack. So I was I thought that he was attacking me in some way and I didn't
[57:03.740 --> 57:08.420]  understand how. I think I was a little bit. Yeah, he definitely was attacking you. Oh, he was.
[57:08.420 --> 57:12.720]  OK, I didn't pick it up. No, I'm just saying that it's like you learned. How do I transfer my
[57:12.720 --> 57:18.400]  crackers from the pantry? Like I don't get the comparable because it's not like I clone the
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.140]  crackers and then throw away the crackers. It's honestly the most direct comparison. It would be
[57:23.140 --> 57:27.840]  like if you had a fridge and a freezer and then a deep freezer in your garage and you would like
[57:27.840 --> 57:32.020]  some stuff belongs in the freezer. But if it's the freezers getting too full, I got to move it to the
[57:32.020 --> 57:36.740]  deep freezer where I rarely go to. And that's why I think what Andrew is saying is that he doesn't
[57:37.200 --> 57:42.540]  he doesn't make a one to one copy of the frozen waffle. Yeah, that's that's one of them. And then
[57:42.540 --> 57:47.820]  been the other. That's the function of the external drive is copying to then get rid of the
[57:47.820 --> 57:54.340]  base. I'm not pulling my bread out of the pantry and then cloning it and then throwing the bread
[57:54.340 --> 57:59.940]  away. That's what I was very baffled by when you were making the comparison. And I thought maybe
[57:59.940 --> 58:03.220]  you're like trying to take a dig at me for not putting stuff away. But this is nothing to put
[58:03.220 --> 58:09.660]  stuff away. I generally put stuff away. What is that on the keyboard? A knife? Yeah, I had I had
[58:09.660 --> 58:18.260]  to clear my I had to clear stuff off of it. I had a plate on top of it. And the fork just or the knife
[58:18.260 --> 58:26.260]  magnetized to that corner of the laptop. And I just wait. Wait, what happened? It magnetized
[58:26.260 --> 58:31.980]  to the laptop. It's magnet. It's it locked on. It's a magnet. Oh, that's that's good. That's
[58:31.980 --> 58:35.680]  what you want, right, Gavin? You want a lot of magnets like kind of like around your hard drives
[58:35.680 --> 58:40.880]  in your laptop, your screen, when it's writing data. So you've got like a missing file. The rest
[58:40.880 --> 58:46.260]  of it's in the knife. Well, the magnet is built in. So clearly it's supposed to be there. I didn't
[58:46.260 --> 58:53.420]  put the magnet in the laptop. No. Did you know if when you're transferring, if you're transferring
[58:53.420 --> 58:57.940]  files, if you put a magnet the right way next to the one that's pushing the files to the other,
[58:57.940 --> 59:02.300]  you can actually push them faster. That's how you delete files, right? It corrupts it.
[59:03.020 --> 59:06.260]  I've seen spy films where they like rub a bunch of magnets on the thing.
[59:06.600 --> 59:10.240]  I don't think so. That's definitely a thing. You corrupt the computer with the magnet.
[59:10.800 --> 59:15.500]  I think you just push or pull data faster or slower. So you got like an iron knife.
[59:16.800 --> 59:20.160]  Yeah, I guess. I don't know what it's fucking made of. It's a knife.
[59:23.580 --> 59:29.080]  I don't know what it's fucking made of. Gavin, what are your knives made of?
[59:29.460 --> 59:34.620]  Are you concerned about the material of your cutlery? I just don't think mine are magnetic.
[59:35.660 --> 59:38.120]  They could be. I just don't think they're magnetic. Mail me one. I'll try it.
[59:39.920 --> 59:47.480]  Send me a spoon and I'll see if it attaches. I'd say send me a knife, but I don't need one.
[59:47.480 --> 59:53.280]  I don't have a spoon. It's already there. Yeah, I'm ready. I don't know why it's magnetized in
[59:53.280 --> 59:58.880]  that part. Is that for like the lid? Something with the lid, maybe? Why would it be magnetized
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.600]  in the bottom right corner? Is there a hard drive in it or is it SSD?
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:14.340]  What? You think I know? You think I got that information for you?
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:17.940]  Sometimes when you open a file, does it show you the hourglass and go like...
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:27.260]  A bar moves. So I know SSD is solid state drive. So I got that going for me.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.900]  Yeah, it's not spinning. How do I tell? Okay, so I clicked the home.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.600]  Sorry, technical difficulties with me again. Which we still haven't been able to make because
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.780]  you've had... I ordered the wrong electrical cable. What does that mean, electrical cable?
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:46.320]  Power cable? I thought this computer had a lightning port and I bought a lightning
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.540]  port to HDMI converter, but it's a Thunderbolt port. So I had to get a different converter.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.320]  Which I now have. Okay. Oh, good. So that should be all good.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:03.800]  So I click this PC and I have OSC and my passport D.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:15.040]  You got that, Gavin? My passport D is your external drive as well as WB, my passports.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:21.300]  Yeah, less than digital. Yeah. So OSC is your hard drive. Gavin's been giving me a lot of crap
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:26.380]  about this. I sent him a computer issue I had today and he never replied. Didn't help me at all.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.780]  Oh god, you did. You sent me just... that was the first thing I saw this morning. It was some sort
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:36.000]  of, like, kernel panic report of some sort. So you didn't help him for as long as you humanly
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:49.120]  could today. I got a panic CPU one-caller OX... user space watchdog timeout, no successful
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.200]  check-ins. I love the idea of I want to not help you longer, so I'm going to wake up early.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.340]  The only way to not help him anymore would be to set your alarm.
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:09.440]  What is the capacity of your C drive? I'm gonna go dump this gerbler out, you figure that out.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:22.680]  This is great. I love this show so much. It's not even like you're, like, being critical or
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:28.440]  whatever. You're just asking a couple of questions and it just... the house of cards starts to
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:37.720]  crumble. Oh yeah, I'm not here trying to stump him. But it sounds like he's gonna be needing
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:46.860]  the question mark key a lot. What did I miss?
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.620]  I was just saying, I'm not trying to mess with you, I'm just trying to learn a little bit about
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:00.100]  your computer. I can't believe you asked me what material my knife is made out of.
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:03.420]  Easy. Well, that was like, I'm a knife guy.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.940]  No, it's titanium steel. What are you saying? It's not pancakes with it, man. I don't know
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:17.860]  what to tell you. This is great. It made me look up the Ukrainian Jackrabbit again,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.540]  because I felt like Gavin was in Ukrainian Jackrabbit mode where he was going after Andrew.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.800]  And that's just a taste of what you can expect in our upcoming technical difficulty
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:35.860]  supplemental starring Andrew Panton and his computers. Are you serious, Jeff? You can expect
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:41.740]  that on the 22nd when we launch the Gerpler at noon central and you guys are playing Mario Party
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:47.700]  again. The return of Dilkong. You think Andrew wants to do that? I can't wait. This is exciting.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:53.180]  By the way, speaking of that, are you aware, Eric, that you made us record not a time travel
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:57.460]  announcement, but a regular present day announcement on the same episode where we'd
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:05.160]  made that announcement? Yes. It's in the episode. Yes. Why did you do that? Because we need to
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:12.260]  announce it more than once. More than once in the same file? Yes. Wouldn't you want to put it
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.280]  somewhere where they're not already going to hear it in 40 minutes? There's a reason I've talked
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.880]  about it twice in this episode. Yeah. You got to take a look at our retention, buddy. You think
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:28.220]  they're making a 40 minutes in? You're at you're out of your mind. There are people who googled.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.600]  Can I change my vote the day after the election? I'm not taking any chances. You got to just say
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:42.160]  it more than once. That's it. Huh. OK. I and I steal or some shit like I'm fucking going to a
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.780]  knife store and say, hey, do you have copper knives? Fucking crazy.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:57.900]  We're going to end sync so we can wrap this. Hey, let me. Are you done with it? Yeah. Let's
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.700]  I'm good. Let's go to the next one. But on the way out, let me ask you guys a question.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.480]  Do you think this episode 28 was as good as our previous episode 28?
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:13.360]  Do you think we do you think we we met our own bar? I think I've got a fever in the middle
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.040]  of this episode. I don't like I don't think you can compare them in that way. I think they're
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.160]  different. It's different. Uses at different times in our lives. That's you saying you think
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.840]  the first one's better. Got it. OK, thank you for listening to another episode of the regulation
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:34.400]  podcast. We're glad you stuck with it all the way through. I assume you did because you're hearing
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.260]  me say this right now. If you're not hearing me say this right now, did I even say it? We'll see
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:44.120]  you next week. What are knives made of? I'm freezing.
