[00:00.000 --> 00:04.620]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[00:05.120 --> 00:11.500]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated, and it just feels so good.
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.180]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[00:18.740 --> 00:23.920]  suddenly it seems quite practical. The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[00:24.260 --> 00:29.420]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.
[00:29.420 --> 00:34.200]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:34.260 --> 00:42.540]  With me, as always, Andrew Patton, Gavin Freene. I'm a new man. Eric Baddour. This is episode 22.
[00:43.580 --> 00:50.660]  You say it like, I gotta go cut the grass, then go to fucking Costco, gotta get my oil changed.
[00:50.740 --> 00:52.580]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:52.580 --> 00:57.380]  Jeff, I'm a new man. I had a big life event since we last talked. Okay.
[00:57.980 --> 01:02.680]  I've been hearing about it for a long time. I finally took that Pepsi challenge. I'm a Pepsi guy.
[01:02.980 --> 01:09.440]  Are you serious? No, I'm just kidding. I was making a joke because that would be such an
[01:09.440 --> 01:13.360]  insignificant life event. Pepsi's fine. I think Pepsi's better than a two liter. That's a big
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.380]  deal, dude. Yeah, you know, if I look down the roster, I probably am more of a Pepsi guy than
[01:18.380 --> 01:22.680]  a Coke guy. But head to head, I probably would lean Coke. I'm right there with you. Wait, wait,
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.540]  wait. What you just said there made absolutely no sense. No, what do you mean? Repeat it.
[01:28.580 --> 01:32.860]  Repeat it back to me and then I'll explain. Pretend that you're me. You say what I said.
[01:33.420 --> 01:38.020]  You said something like, down the line, I prefer this thing. But head to head,
[01:38.080 --> 01:43.500]  I prefer the other thing. Yeah. So Pepsi and Coke are both brands, Gavin. They make a variety
[01:43.500 --> 01:48.960]  of beverages. I'm saying if I look down their roster, you know, like Marvel versus DC,
[01:49.520 --> 01:56.440]  probably lean more Pepsi. But head to head as beverages, I would be more of a Coke fan.
[01:56.560 --> 02:02.260]  So you're saying you're more of a Pepsi Co fan, but head to head, you prefer Coke over Pepsi.
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.860]  Yes, I would. Mountain Dew way better than Maliello. Crush is better than Fanta.
[02:07.500 --> 02:11.220]  I've never had Starry. Barks is better. Starry's so good, dude.
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.540]  But what happens when you throw in curing Dr. Pepper to the mix, Andrew?
[02:16.540 --> 02:24.180]  Oh, let's see. See, I view Dr. Pepper is like it is the third party candidate of the soda world.
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.820]  The Jill Stein of soda. Yes, it is.
[02:29.800 --> 02:35.100]  Keurig, Arsicola, fuck. Well, wait, Crush is, but Crush is Pepsi, isn't it?
[02:35.680 --> 02:40.740]  According to the other thing, does Pepsi own part of this? Because on the other graphic,
[02:40.940 --> 02:46.180]  Pepsi has Crush. I think they bounced like different brands have bounced around from time to time.
[02:46.540 --> 02:50.720]  Maybe. Because I don't know, like, well, Barks is the best root beer.
[02:51.060 --> 02:56.140]  Kind of like how Chuck E. Cheese owned Showbiz for a while and now they own Chuck E. Cheese
[02:56.140 --> 03:02.400]  eventually. Yeah, I don't like it when when the main one doesn't have its own thing, though. Like,
[03:02.420 --> 03:07.980]  you know how Mars owns all the chocolate? Yeah, sure. Galaxy and all that stuff. But they also
[03:07.980 --> 03:15.640]  have a Mars bar, like the the flagship thing. But there's no like there's no PepsiCo juice.
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.600]  It's Pepsi. What do you mean? Pepsi. The fuck are you talking about? Are you? Oh,
[03:19.620 --> 03:25.720]  are you upset that it's not called PepsiCo? Yeah, exactly. But but that is now I will say that is
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.620]  that's what Eric, the actor, called it when he when he made his demand when he made his demand
[03:32.620 --> 03:40.760]  for all those two liters of PepsiCo in New Mexico. But as long as there were no werewolves.
[03:40.760 --> 03:47.060]  Hey, shout out to shout out to werewolf fearing Eric, the actor. May he rest in peace. Looking
[03:47.060 --> 03:52.800]  at this graphic as you know, if you want to attack me, Gavin, as a ridiculous point, I think Dr.
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.380]  Pepper should be at the top. That's what bothers me about this graphic, because it's why wouldn't
[03:57.380 --> 04:02.620]  Dr. Pepper be at the top? Because it's cola across the top and it's not a cola. But I feel like it's
[04:02.620 --> 04:07.240]  like, hey, this is this brand's heavy hitter. Keurig Dr. Pepper's heavy hitter should not be at
[04:07.240 --> 04:11.040]  the bottom of this. I saw a tick tock the other day. I don't know if I sent it to you guys that
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.480]  said it was like one of those realization tick tocks. And the guy said, I just realized that
[04:16.480 --> 04:21.800]  Dr. Pepper is just barbecue Sprite. And I have been laughing about that in the back of my head
[04:21.800 --> 04:28.400]  for like a fucking week. Whoa, that's crazy. Barbecue Sprite. It's the funniest fucking thing
[04:28.400 --> 04:35.120]  I've ever heard. I can't explain like I don't know that I can verbalize why. But it makes sense,
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.880]  but you said it. And I went, that's exactly what it is, though. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah,
[04:40.340 --> 04:47.680]  it's so weird because it just hits so hard when he said it. You big beans guy, Gavin? Love him. Well,
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.160]  Heinz baked beans. Absolutely. Like breakfast beans. Actually, I bought you a can of baked
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.020]  beans to expand the palate a little bit just the other day. I have to send me beans. Yeah,
[05:00.040 --> 05:03.440]  I was buying other stuff and I was on a site and I was looking at what else they had.
[05:03.440 --> 05:11.080]  They had cans of Dr. Pepper infused baked beans. Got some of those, man. Going to be a great time.
[05:11.520 --> 05:16.480]  I'll try them. I'm not, you know, as you know, I'm not a soda guy, but I don't mind Dr. Pepper.
[05:16.780 --> 05:22.800]  I can weigh in on the Dr. Pepper baked beans because Emily insisted we buy them about three
[05:22.800 --> 05:26.940]  weeks ago when she saw them at the store because we're big baked beans people over here. And
[05:28.260 --> 05:33.620]  extremely, I don't want to color Gavin's opinion. This is coming from a Dr. Pepper fan and a huge
[05:33.620 --> 05:37.840]  baked bean fan. Shall I deafen while you give the review? Yeah, earmuffs. Okay. All right.
[05:37.900 --> 05:42.180]  Tell me when to come back. I'll let you know. Just watch the chat. I'll let you know when to
[05:42.180 --> 05:47.280]  come back. All right. Is he gone? Can you believe this fucking guy? What an idiot. He got married.
[05:47.420 --> 05:52.160]  What a moron. He made us fly all the way over there. What a god damn Jesus Christ. Dude,
[05:52.520 --> 05:56.360]  these Dr. Pepper baked beans are some of the worst and most disappointing
[05:57.920 --> 06:03.380]  collaborations I've ever experienced. That is what I expected. I felt like you're about to
[06:03.380 --> 06:07.620]  say extremely. And I was like, that's going to go one way or the other. It's going to be great
[06:07.620 --> 06:14.720]  or awful. Yeah. Okay. All right. Here he comes. He's back. Oh, come back. What a review, Jeff,
[06:15.200 --> 06:20.020]  on the baked beans. And that's how I honestly feel. Oh, I appreciate that. I appreciate you
[06:20.020 --> 06:25.380]  being honest about the baked beans. I wonder what was said. The audience knows and you don't. What
[06:25.380 --> 06:29.800]  a mystery. I better eat these beans before I proof this episode. Nah, it's not happening. I
[06:29.800 --> 06:34.380]  don't even have them yet. It's going to take a while. That was a completely pointless exercise,
[06:34.500 --> 06:39.060]  considering you proof these. Well, I can go out and get some, can't I? Uh, I guess. But then what
[06:39.060 --> 06:43.360]  am I going to do with two cans of these fucking beans? I like that you don't want me to go and
[06:43.360 --> 06:49.160]  buy them because otherwise you'll have two. Yeah. You're also never going to send them to Gavin.
[06:49.420 --> 06:54.160]  He's never going to have these beans. That's not true. He's never going to listen to episode 22
[06:54.160 --> 07:01.020]  of this podcast. This is one, this is an episode where I haven't heard the previous one,
[07:01.220 --> 07:06.760]  which I always like to do, but I didn't even know we'd done one. I don't know what you mean.
[07:06.980 --> 07:11.680]  Well, I listened to episode 20 and I was like, okay, yeah, that's where we're up to. No, we did
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.820]  21. 21 was hot, dude. We were talking about it before you got here. Episode 21 is the one where
[07:16.820 --> 07:22.600]  we made Andrew explain to us why he thinks we sink. Um, and then we talked about getting hit
[07:22.600 --> 07:27.780]  by a pitch or hit by a linebacker, the terminal velocity of a grape. We talked about the, uh,
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.660]  kicker pitcher's bounds. Oh yeah. Pitcher's mound. We talked about the open-faced mash hash
[07:32.660 --> 07:37.820]  cash sandwich. And, uh, the thing that I wanted to make sure that it's not something that we need
[07:37.820 --> 07:41.320]  to bring up or whatever, but the thing that I really liked was the crime capsule. So that was
[07:41.320 --> 07:46.520]  all last time. Uh, but that's, but now this is this time. It's like someone describing their
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.440]  dream. I don't think these episodes get baked into my brain until I listened to them. Like just
[07:51.440 --> 07:57.940]  recording them has absolutely no effect on my memory. You know what will have baked into your
[07:57.940 --> 08:04.400]  memory? Some Dr. Pepper beans. Yeah. They're going to be there. So we do have a lot to get
[08:04.400 --> 08:09.180]  to today and we're only recording one episode. I have a ton of notes. I assume we won't get to
[08:09.180 --> 08:14.280]  most of them. Uh, I imagine there is that a certain event, uh, that, that may come up.
[08:14.320 --> 08:18.780]  We might want to discuss a little bit. Eric, I had a photo you and I took for a reveal. I can't
[08:18.780 --> 08:22.880]  find it in my phone. I don't know. Do you want me to, you want me to drop it in the, uh, in the
[08:22.880 --> 08:29.160]  thing? It was time. Okay. You, you let me know when I got it at the ready boss. Okay. You're
[08:29.160 --> 08:34.100]  talking about, uh, events, Jeff. I mean, there's a big event, you know, obviously that we got to
[08:34.100 --> 08:41.500]  cover is a puzzle. We had representatives at a puzzle tournament. Yes. Yes, we did. I completely
[08:41.500 --> 08:48.020]  forgot about that. Cause the other dumb thing we did, uh, I, I was so excited. You recorded a piece
[08:48.020 --> 08:54.860]  of supplemental content for it, right? I did. Yeah. I saw the post at like 1130 PM on that day.
[08:54.920 --> 09:02.520]  And it was, uh, two regulation community members, I guess, comment leavers at this point, uh, went
[09:02.520 --> 09:08.500]  to like the world speed competition pulse. I'm forgetting the proper name of the tournament.
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.620]  It's like the Superbowl of puzzle. It's the Superbowl of, yeah. And they had to say those
[09:13.620 --> 09:20.120]  two words together. It's the big game of puzzle competitions. It's the Superbowl of beans puzzle
[09:20.120 --> 09:27.080]  equivalent. Um, and, uh, they, they made regulation puzzler shirts, which was very exciting. And in
[09:27.080 --> 09:32.900]  the post, they mentioned that one of them were advancing to the semifinals, which I thought,
[09:32.980 --> 09:38.960]  Oh, what, what are those? I'd love to watch those. And, uh, it, I think it started at like 2 AM.
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.820]  So it just completely shifted my entire thing of like, okay, I guess I'm going to stay up till
[09:43.820 --> 09:51.720]  2 AM and watch this puzzling event, which was a lot of fun. I've never, uh, observed anything
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.640]  like that. I I'm completely disconnected from that community. What a community,
[09:56.940 --> 10:00.540]  very wholesome, very excited about puzzles. It was a lot of fun to watch.
[10:00.540 --> 10:04.820]  It went the way that anything related to our show would go.
[10:07.360 --> 10:13.500]  Um, I don't know. I think it's okay for me to say I don't think it ruins the supplemental in any way.
[10:13.700 --> 10:20.300]  So how these tournaments work is everybody's going simultaneously. It is a room filled with
[10:20.300 --> 10:26.580]  people. Imagine like 50 people sitting at desks simultaneously doing puzzles. It's probably even
[10:26.580 --> 10:31.800]  more. It's a lot of people. And, uh, they go through it. And then as they solve them,
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.600]  they will cut to the person who did it, like the moment they did it. So they have their little
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.880]  moment where they're all happy. Nick just asked no floor puzzlers. No, there were no floor puzzlers.
[10:43.520 --> 10:47.560]  They cut to the people when they finish. They're like, yeah, look at, look at us.
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.400]  And as soon as it started, I saw a regulation puzzler. I was all excited as calling them out
[10:52.400 --> 10:56.780]  and we're going through. And as it's progressing, it's like people are showing their puzzles.
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.620]  They're all good. And then they started giving a lot of coverage to the regulation puzzler
[11:02.620 --> 11:09.240]  because they were right at the end. And it was very exciting. And then they said over the broadcast,
[11:09.560 --> 11:17.460]  we have a special guest. And it cut away from the people making puzzles. And it was the first time
[11:17.460 --> 11:23.640]  they just focused on the commentary team. And they kept the shot there for like 15 seconds as
[11:23.640 --> 11:28.760]  one of the people who solved puzzles was now going to talk about solving the puzzle. And by the time
[11:28.760 --> 11:35.600]  they cut back within that short 15 second window was when the regulation puzzler completed their
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.920]  puzzle and showed it up. There's no footage of it. They had no moment. They are the only
[11:42.720 --> 11:49.660]  person from what I can tell that completed their puzzle and didn't get a little moment of like,
[11:49.820 --> 11:56.740]  yeah, look at me. I did it. Oh, no. Are we going to be relying on bootleg, like crowd footage?
[11:57.120 --> 12:01.700]  If we want to see the finished puzzle that they made? Yes. But the supplemental is me going, no,
[12:01.900 --> 12:09.320]  no, don't cut away. No. Well, surely, surely they'll cut back to them. And oh, and they just
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.440]  we never see it. They're the only one, I think, that we don't see. But it was a very entertaining
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.520]  tournament. I felt inspired about doing puzzles. It made me feel even worse about my performance
[12:19.520 --> 12:30.380]  in our actual event. And what performance? My attempt. Listen, if you if you show up at the
[12:30.380 --> 12:36.800]  Olympics, Eric, if you show up at the Olympics and you jump the gun and you dive in the water
[12:36.800 --> 12:45.540]  and get disqualified, that's still a performance. If we're likening your performance to Olympic
[12:45.540 --> 12:52.280]  athletes, you're the Australian break dancer. Like you gave you didn't even give your best
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.120]  effort. You just went, ah, got him. Like, what are you talking about? You insulted a nation.
[12:58.660 --> 13:04.540]  No, I didn't insult the nation. First of all, to compare me to the Australian break dancer,
[13:04.540 --> 13:08.160]  they actually like accomplished a lot. They got a lot of attention for their performance.
[13:08.540 --> 13:12.220]  My I did not. I am somebody who nobody would have even known was at the event,
[13:12.660 --> 13:19.540]  was my level of how my performance came out. There was a lot of effort put in to what came out.
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.520]  Well, you weren't there. Most of the effort was cleaning your table off. I spent over an hour
[13:25.520 --> 13:33.320]  trying to make a puzzle. That doesn't count. You don't get a gold medal for buying your frame. I'm
[13:33.320 --> 13:39.620]  saying I disqualified at the event and barely showed up. Who's saying I want a gold medal?
[13:41.020 --> 13:44.140]  I just don't know how you can classify that as effort towards the thing.
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.800]  Well, I spent more effort than you did on it.
[13:49.680 --> 13:56.040]  I didn't take a photo. Can you explain how? I spent more time trying to build the puzzle than
[13:56.040 --> 14:04.140]  you did. At least equal. Guys, I think we might need to have another puzzle off.
[14:04.320 --> 14:10.360]  Can we pick a puzzle where the edges aren't all the exact same?
[14:10.780 --> 14:16.940]  I'll tell you what, we'll pick an easier puzzle. I just thought the bears looked sweet staring at
[14:16.940 --> 14:23.700]  the sunset, but it was a goddamn difficult puzzle, even for me, a regulation constant puzzler. So
[14:23.700 --> 14:28.100]  I will pick the next 500 piece puzzle. I'll make sure everybody agrees on it first,
[14:28.340 --> 14:33.300]  but we'll get that going in the background. Absolutely. Yeah, I can't wait. Listen,
[14:33.440 --> 14:43.980]  this is going to be serious. I felt inspired. While we're talking about how awesome our audience
[14:43.980 --> 14:48.440]  is, I just wanted to give a quick shout out. I don't think I mentioned this in 21, but
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.340]  we recorded it like a year ago, so it's hard to remember. A couple of weeks ago,
[14:52.340 --> 14:58.340]  a regulation listener, well, I guess comment weaver, reached out to me via the SoAllRight email
[14:58.340 --> 15:03.460]  to let me know that they work for Alice Cooper, the musician, and that they're going to be in
[15:03.460 --> 15:09.760]  town in Austin for a big Alice Cooper show and offered regulation tickets if we wanted to go.
[15:09.900 --> 15:14.840]  Nobody else was available, so Emily and BurnDog and Vanessa and I went. I was available.
[15:15.560 --> 15:20.980]  You didn't respond in the fucking text chat. It was in Slack for 24 hours.
[15:20.980 --> 15:24.400]  It was, it's true. He did, yeah. What did it say? It said,
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.880]  would anyone like to go to this show with me? I need to know in the next 24 hours or
[15:28.880 --> 15:33.800]  I'm going to give the tickets away. Now, Gavin, what did you want it to say?
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.620]  I just thought it was, I thought, for some reason, I thought you said,
[15:38.700 --> 15:42.640]  I'm going to see Alice Cooper. And so Gavin wants a gold medal for
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.960]  his interaction with Alice Cooper. I'm not trying to place on going to Alice Cooper.
[15:49.420 --> 15:53.940]  Anyway, it was a fucking awesome show. I'm going to do a whole bunch of Alice Cooper content over
[15:53.940 --> 15:59.040]  on Soul Ride because I fell in love with 76 year old Alice Cooper who looks younger than I do,
[15:59.120 --> 16:05.320]  by the way, and is an inspiration as a creative artist, because that guy is just as good at 76
[16:05.320 --> 16:10.540]  as he was in his 40s when I was growing up. And it was an awesome time. But I really just wanted
[16:10.540 --> 16:14.760]  to say thank you to Riley, who got us the tickets and who we got to hang out with for a little bit
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.260]  after the show. Awesome. Awesome, dude. And really appreciate it. And what a fucking amazing
[16:19.260 --> 16:24.700]  community we have. Did Alice Cooper get decapitated in your show? Yes, he did. Oh, hell,
[16:24.720 --> 16:30.840]  yeah. I saw that. That's awesome. Does his head come off a lot? Yeah. Well, his head only came
[16:30.840 --> 16:36.380]  off once, but I got dude, I got a ton of Alice Cooper fucking images. It was such a cool visually
[16:36.380 --> 16:40.480]  show. I'll just throw these up in the chat so I can remember to put them in the. Yeah, I was so
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.420]  happy, Jeff, when you posted the photo. I don't remember if it was in our Slack or text chain,
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.900]  whatever. But you you shared previous that you were at this concert reading as someone who
[16:49.900 --> 16:55.540]  properly read your message. I interpreted it as you may not be going. And so to see you at the
[16:55.540 --> 16:59.220]  show. Very exciting. Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to because it was like right
[16:59.220 --> 17:04.500]  before we left for England and it was a little inconvenient because of that. But I just it was
[17:04.500 --> 17:11.180]  such a cool offer and I really wanted to make it happen. And I'm so glad we did because it was it
[17:11.180 --> 17:16.580]  was like really impressive, too, by the way. I mean, for just as a stage show, impressive,
[17:16.820 --> 17:22.800]  let alone the fact that the dude's in his mid 70s and he does like five different wardrobe changes.
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.160]  He's there's a fucking giant Frankenstein's monster that runs around the stage. He gets up on
[17:28.160 --> 17:32.580]  a big shit, doesn't he? Yeah, he does. He got all kinds of stuff. But anyway, I just need that for
[17:32.580 --> 17:38.340]  my thumbnail and stuff. Very cool. Yeah. Bunch of awesome images. Going to delete that from my notes.
[17:38.480 --> 17:46.420]  And then turn to speaking about going to the overseas guys went to England for an I really
[17:46.420 --> 17:51.020]  appreciate. I thought it was a great idea. We talked about the crime capsule last episode.
[17:51.520 --> 17:56.720]  Y'all all went overseas to do some crime so they couldn't they couldn't hold them against you in
[17:56.720 --> 18:00.920]  your own country, I believe. Right. That was the whole idea as the basis of the trip.
[18:02.860 --> 18:11.960]  International crimes. Gavin. Yes. That would have been a it's kind of your thing. Oh, yeah.
[18:12.140 --> 18:18.800]  Yeah. Crimes overseas. We talked about crimes. Why? I think the crime capsule. I was clearly
[18:18.800 --> 18:23.040]  making a joke about the fact that you guys were all overseas and that you were actually there
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.220]  for the wedding, but I was setting it up as if it was a different event. He wants a gold medal for
[18:28.220 --> 18:32.960]  his joke, Gavin. Let's just explain the joke because he was confused by it. I was so scared
[18:32.960 --> 18:37.300]  of stepping on the punch line to your joke that I was no, no, no, no, no. But that was listen,
[18:37.360 --> 18:42.240]  that was it. I was just as how has he got married? How much of that do you think made the episode?
[18:42.460 --> 18:48.580]  All of it. Every single moment of it. 100% of it. All right. Serve me up with the crime shit again.
[18:52.160 --> 18:56.140]  Anyway, that's a but that's enough about the community. Andrew, you wanted to say something
[18:56.140 --> 19:02.120]  about the crime capsule? Already said it and nailed it. Gavin isn't talking about his wedding
[19:02.120 --> 19:12.660]  is the issue. I got married. Yeah, congrats. Oh, my God. Oh, man. Oh, did I? If any of that's in,
[19:12.740 --> 19:20.760]  that is all of it. Do not remove any of it. Thanks. The episode was going so well there
[19:20.760 --> 19:26.400]  for a while. I felt it was humming. Really? It was humming along. Great. Like the wedding did,
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.920]  I assume. Good old hum to that wedding. Gavin got married. Our little our little Gavi Wavi,
[19:33.060 --> 19:41.220]  who I've known since he was just about just turned 15 after all this time, finally got married.
[19:42.020 --> 19:46.560]  Congratulations, buddy. That completes our friendship story arc that I was going for when
[19:46.560 --> 19:53.440]  I was 14, I guess. So what's your next story arc? Is that it? Are we done? I thought maybe that was
[19:53.440 --> 19:59.880]  the end of the friendship. No, we've now been each other's best man. I don't think a lot of
[19:59.880 --> 20:06.420]  people can say that. That's true. It is true. It was it was such an honor, such a genuine honor to
[20:06.420 --> 20:12.120]  get to be your best man. And I want you to know I put more work into getting that right than just
[20:12.120 --> 20:19.460]  about anything else I've done in my life. It was I was it was it was I was beyond excited.
[20:19.900 --> 20:23.820]  You're an amazing best man. I had several conversations afterwards with different
[20:23.820 --> 20:31.000]  family members and I just listened to my family praise you for multiple minutes.
[20:31.460 --> 20:36.940]  Your family and I are on very good terms right now. We like each other a lot. We're in a we're
[20:36.940 --> 20:43.940]  in a deep like relationship right now. They are the fucking best. Deep like? Yeah, I like them.
[20:43.980 --> 20:48.280]  I like them intensely. They're fucking awesome. I'm gonna go stay with your grandparents next time
[20:48.280 --> 20:55.980]  I'm in London. It's a whole family. Yeah, I think you did invite a few people. That's great.
[20:58.020 --> 21:05.060]  Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and

[21:57.700 --> 22:02.760]  My family also put in some reviews on some of the various goings on at the wedding.
[22:02.760 --> 22:11.440]  Oh, really? Yep. Love this guy. It's a picture of Eric dancing.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.720]  He definitely seemed to be having a great time.
[22:16.180 --> 22:22.020]  My family were praising you, Jeff. I had several members of my family say,
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.940]  hey, come and look at this.
[22:27.540 --> 22:32.260]  And it was just Eric just going ape shit on the dance floor like he does at weddings.
[22:32.260 --> 22:37.020]  You had a great you had a you had a you had a pretty good DJ. He was playing. He was playing
[22:37.020 --> 22:40.920]  like a lot of 80s hits. I don't know where like I don't know what your must plays were or like
[22:40.920 --> 22:45.200]  what the vibe was that you told them. But man, when he was like deep in the 80s, pretty good
[22:45.200 --> 22:49.780]  stuff. Pretty, pretty good. Yeah, that was that was pretty much the only thing I submitted to him.
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.780]  You did great. Those were yeah, he played some great hits. I will say
[22:53.780 --> 22:58.000]  album versions of a lot of stuff. A lot of album. You ever heard the full song of something?
[22:58.560 --> 23:04.420]  Boy, he was doing it. But is that is that why in one of the videos you're just dancing around
[23:04.420 --> 23:08.800]  and then randomly for no reason, you just start screaming at the top of your lungs.
[23:09.260 --> 23:15.900]  They never play this version. Yeah, they play the long version. Yeah, it's like when you hear
[23:16.400 --> 23:22.480]  Get Lucky by Daft Punk at a wedding or at like something, you assume it's going to be about 90
[23:22.480 --> 23:27.160]  seconds because it is just that's what it's made for. It's to be mixed into like the next thing.
[23:27.160 --> 23:32.440]  This guy went five minutes, 50 seconds. You want to hear every fucking one of them. And
[23:33.060 --> 23:38.140]  it was the album version. It was I think Jessica Negri was was going around. She
[23:38.140 --> 23:43.480]  messaged me and she's like, I have so many videos of you dancing. And I just said, you're welcome.
[23:44.900 --> 23:50.060]  I will say of all the Madonna songs, Papa Don't Preach, crazy pick at a wedding.
[23:50.060 --> 23:57.320]  What an absolutely insane choice. What an insane choice. I did pick originally like a prayer,
[23:57.580 --> 24:02.040]  but I got the feedback that it was overplayed because of the Wolverine movie. Oh, I could
[24:02.040 --> 24:06.420]  see that. There was a kid who did the whole NSYNC dance, who definitely was too young to
[24:06.420 --> 24:12.080]  watch Deadpool, but saw the fuck out of Deadpool. Boy, he saw Deadpool and he knew the dance. It
[24:12.080 --> 24:17.740]  was pretty cool. Is this the all sharing photos portion of the wedding? Because I have one I want
[24:17.740 --> 24:24.940]  to share as well. Somebody caught this photo of Gavin right as I'm giving my speech. And in the
[24:24.940 --> 24:30.040]  speech, I say it's at the moment I say for the next six and a half minutes, you're going to have
[24:30.040 --> 24:34.220]  to listen to me cry or whatever. And that's Gavin's reaction to realizing my speech was six minutes.
[24:36.500 --> 24:39.460]  Mine was not that long. What's going on in your head there, Gav?
[24:40.380 --> 24:43.360]  Oh, man, I'm going to have to read mine slower because
[24:43.360 --> 24:50.280]  because that's going to make mine seem real short. Your speech was perfect, man. I was like
[24:50.280 --> 24:53.700]  afraid you were like, oh God, I'm gonna have to listen to this guy drone on for six fucking minutes.
[24:54.140 --> 25:00.960]  No, I was just worried about mine. It was great. The food was so good. Never been to a wedding
[25:00.960 --> 25:10.160]  where we all sat at one long table. That should be the default for weddings. That was awesome.
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.360]  Totally agree. Also, everybody had Turkish delight. It was delicious.
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.880]  Gavin loves Turkish delight, dude. That's like his thing. He loves it.
[25:18.900 --> 25:21.000]  It was like in the ice cream, right?
[25:21.660 --> 25:23.760]  It was like the ice cream was on top of it. Yeah.
[25:24.320 --> 25:25.040]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[25:27.600 --> 25:36.060]  Also, the boys did a little something I think we can talk about. There was a fun little addition
[25:36.060 --> 25:42.380]  to the wedding. We wanted to make it a little regulation-esque. Andrew and Nick, you're not
[25:42.380 --> 25:48.740]  aware of this, but I thought it might be I thought it might be fun if I brought a friend with me to
[25:48.740 --> 25:53.900]  the wedding as a surprise. Didn't tell Eric or Gavin or anybody ahead of time and surprise them
[25:53.900 --> 25:59.900]  on the day with a little bit of extra wedding jewelry for us all to wear. You see in the photo
[25:59.900 --> 26:08.340]  there, I might be wearing a certain Vegas Ricky's watch. I've got I've got his wristlet and his
[26:08.340 --> 26:17.220]  class ring on that Neptune high baby all the way because we're going snake eyes style at the
[26:17.220 --> 26:22.560]  Gavin wedding. And Gavin, we didn't get a photo of it, but what was around your neck as you got
[26:22.560 --> 26:32.000]  married to Meg? I was wearing the necklace. Does Meg know you got married with Nicholas Cage around
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.280]  your neck? Well, she didn't until later that night where I was getting undressed and we'd finished.
[26:38.380 --> 26:43.520]  It was like 1am. I just started unbuttoning and she was like, Jesus, what's that? And I was like,
[26:43.580 --> 26:52.540]  I thought I had like food down me or something. And I was like, oh my God, it's the neck. It's
[26:52.540 --> 26:57.880]  she was OK with that. Didn't make her mad. No, she was fine with it. It was completely
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.520]  invisible for the. Yeah, I think if it started like creeping into pictures, there would have
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.360]  been some conversation about it. Yeah, I was nervous. It's one of those things where I thought
[27:07.360 --> 27:15.320]  I'm going to bring over across the ocean this jewelry we just bought after after all of the
[27:15.320 --> 27:19.140]  kerfuffle of getting it. And I don't know that the guys are going to appreciate this. So I was a
[27:19.140 --> 27:24.740]  little nervous to show it to Eric. Are you kidding me? Do you understand how fast I took that photo?
[27:25.260 --> 27:32.900]  Also, I call that photo tax write off. And then it's like, you know, is Meg going to find it
[27:32.900 --> 27:37.000]  funny that we're bringing movie props to her wedding and making her husband get married in
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.420]  them? You know, it's a little silly, but I'm glad we did it. I'm really glad we did. Oh, so funny.
[27:42.420 --> 27:45.960]  She found it funny. And I think the fact that there was a slight amount of fear in the whole
[27:45.960 --> 27:51.620]  thing made it so much funnier when you presented it like a like you were opening a box of cocaine.
[27:52.700 --> 27:55.680]  He did the same thing to me. It was so cool.
[27:55.760 --> 27:59.120]  He was like looking over both shoulders before popping the topper.
[27:59.260 --> 28:07.580]  Yep. It was really fun. And it wasn't like a very stuffy wedding or anything. It was like
[28:07.580 --> 28:13.160]  it like a really nice estate. I think everyone had a really good time. Jeff wore a great hat.
[28:13.440 --> 28:15.120]  And it was just a lot of fun.
[28:15.120 --> 28:21.420]  I did. We were trying to have the whole thing outside, but in the morning it was looking like
[28:21.420 --> 28:25.760]  it was going to rain. And, uh, I was all for risky and just doing outside. Yeah. But I guess
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.040]  when there's like a string quartet, they don't want to get all their shit wet. So they were like,
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.900]  let's play it safe and do it inside. So that meant that we could do it. We could do it indoors. And,
[28:35.020 --> 28:40.700]  uh, we could do our, our little joke that we did where as we were doing the, the signing stuff,
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.600]  cause it's like, we're doing real legal marriage stuff in the middle of the wedding, which is
[28:44.600 --> 28:49.320]  I think common for English weddings. But, uh, we just had the string quartet start playing
[28:49.320 --> 28:53.240]  the Reigns of Castamere, which is the red wedding music from Game of Thrones.
[28:53.960 --> 28:58.720]  Just like a funny little bit. And then I realized when I was doing all the signing, like
[28:58.720 --> 29:05.660]  it really gets really loud and dramatic and the doors were closed and it did start to get quite
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.380]  sinister. I was worried that it was a little bit too extreme. It's like a little bit.
[29:09.380 --> 29:17.640]  Andrew, it's so weird. The British wedding is so formal. There's someone from like a registrar's
[29:17.640 --> 29:23.660]  office who has to like be present. You do the whole ceremony. You say I do. And then you have
[29:23.660 --> 29:30.020]  to say I am. And I've never heard that before, but yeah, the thing that really got me is I'm
[29:30.020 --> 29:33.160]  going to just send it. This is not the photo of them getting married, but this is sort of what it
[29:33.160 --> 29:39.280]  was. Okay. There's like, you have to sit there and watch them sign paperwork. And then they like
[29:39.280 --> 29:46.820]  take a picture of them having signed paperwork at the table. And it is the most like depression
[29:46.820 --> 29:54.860]  era wedding photo. It's so just like this is the one that the English grandparents like
[29:54.860 --> 30:01.460]  hang in the living room and be like, oh, sorry to be so sentimental. It's me and mom getting
[30:01.460 --> 30:09.040]  married and it's them signing paperwork. It's so crazy. Also imagine the most beautiful room
[30:09.040 --> 30:15.560]  with a gorgeous arch of flowers and Gavin and Meg both look the best they've ever looked in
[30:15.560 --> 30:20.280]  their entire lives standing there with the lady that's marrying him and everybody around them in
[30:20.280 --> 30:26.440]  this beautiful glowing environment. And then to the left is just a round folding table with a
[30:26.440 --> 30:33.100]  lady filling out long form paperwork very fucking seriously, like she's doing taxes the entire time
[30:33.100 --> 30:37.220]  without breaking or looking up, just crunching it out because it's got to be done. Like I think
[30:37.220 --> 30:40.580]  they have to sync it up at the right time or something so that when they say I do, I am she
[30:40.580 --> 30:46.320]  hits the stamp or something. It was weird. Yeah. And I was just like verifying all the contact
[30:46.320 --> 30:49.720]  information. It was like I was buying a plane ticket. It was like everyone sat down and watched
[30:49.720 --> 30:56.560]  me like buy a house. And that's exactly Gavin. It's exactly what you were closing on a house.
[30:56.700 --> 31:02.320]  Yes. Being in the audience was like watching you sign the final paperwork so you can move into
[31:02.320 --> 31:08.960]  your home. It is so it's so weird. I can't like the wedding is interrupted by paperwork
[31:08.960 --> 31:14.020]  for an extended period of time. Yeah, they literally like chat amongst themselves. But
[31:14.020 --> 31:18.520]  then I got so distracted and I couldn't I couldn't read what I was writing because the
[31:18.520 --> 31:28.420]  range of cast of it was so loud. Oh, that's really funny. Oh, God, it was it was awesome.
[31:28.420 --> 31:33.420]  And then we danced for a long time. English weddings are long. English weddings are in a
[31:33.420 --> 31:36.940]  good way. In a good way. Oh, I had a great time. It was paced out really well. And I had like a
[31:36.940 --> 31:41.460]  lot of fun. It's just like, Jesus, dude, like that's an all day affair. I spend most of it
[31:41.460 --> 31:45.020]  talking to people. So I was only just like kind of passing through the dance floor. But there was
[31:45.020 --> 31:51.380]  one bit where you were you were just screaming at the top of your lungs at the painting that was on
[31:51.380 --> 31:58.100]  the wall. Oh, my God. There's just it's there's a guy there's like a painting of like what looks
[31:58.100 --> 32:04.500]  like Lyndon B. Johnson overlooking this dance floor. And like it everything about it was like
[32:04.500 --> 32:09.620]  if I if this guy was a ghost watching me right now, he would be so disappointed about what his
[32:09.620 --> 32:15.880]  estate became because it was it was not made for what I was doing on the dance floor.
[32:17.620 --> 32:22.640]  And then I was I was at the bar. I was just trying to get a drink, I think. And then you came like
[32:22.640 --> 32:28.880]  stumbling in and all your hair was all crazy. And then you just went straight to the water and you
[32:28.880 --> 32:35.400]  just started pouring the biggest glass of water. You just dehydrated on the dance floor. I drank
[32:35.400 --> 32:41.480]  so much fucking sparkling water at that wedding because I would pour a whole glass and then drink
[32:41.480 --> 32:46.020]  it and go, wrong one. And then I would have a glass of still water right afterward. Happened
[32:46.020 --> 32:52.580]  three times at least. It was fun. Had a great time. It was like an amazing time. It was a
[32:52.580 --> 32:58.600]  really, really, really great wedding. It was it was lovely. Meg had like four outfit changes. It
[32:58.600 --> 33:05.060]  was so awesome. Like Meg was awesome through like the whole thing. It was beautiful. It was it was
[33:05.060 --> 33:10.740]  so much fun. It was a blast. It was genuinely such a just such a great experience all the way around.
[33:11.800 --> 33:15.040]  However, it started off a little I was thinking about this this morning. I was collecting my notes.
[33:15.040 --> 33:21.340]  It started off on a bit of a wrong foot for me in the sense that everybody was kind of in town for
[33:21.340 --> 33:27.060]  a couple days before. And then the night before the wedding, Emily and I moved into a little
[33:27.060 --> 33:31.740]  temporary house with Gavin. Meg sort of like a I don't know, like a hangout spot the night before
[33:31.740 --> 33:35.820]  and before the wedding where we spend time together. And I was sitting in the room trying
[33:35.820 --> 33:39.940]  to get comfortable drinking, drinking a little bit of water. And Gavin walked in and I thought,
[33:39.940 --> 33:45.080]  oh, I want to impress him because it's the first time I'd seen him. So I I I raised up on my chair
[33:45.080 --> 33:53.320]  to fart and shit my pants hard. The second I saw Gavin I tried to fart and just shit my pants.
[33:54.380 --> 33:58.940]  I didn't think you even made a noise. You were just like I just came in and you're like shit
[33:58.940 --> 34:06.140]  myself. And I had to just run to the bathroom. Oh, my God. Wow. Yeah, that's crazy. God.
[34:06.140 --> 34:14.020]  Um, well, speaking of uh, speaking of shit, this was like the only photo my wife took of her time
[34:14.020 --> 34:20.380]  in England. Uh, and it was of the toilet in our hotel room. It was that. The Game of Thrones
[34:20.380 --> 34:28.760]  toilet, we called it. What the fuck kind of Tyrion Lannister assassination throne is that? What is
[34:28.760 --> 34:34.960]  ridiculous? Ridiculous. Great. I like the idea of it being a wooden box over it. Like you could
[34:34.960 --> 34:39.720]  custom you could throw a Doritos logo on that thing. You could you could have different face
[34:39.720 --> 34:47.620]  plates like a 360 face. Yeah, like a 360 console. You can do that with your regular. You're talking
[34:47.620 --> 34:52.460]  about a toilet seat. No, no, no, no, no. Where would the face plate go on the what are you
[34:52.460 --> 34:57.880]  talking about? See how it's wood, how it's like there's a wooden box around it covering the
[34:57.880 --> 35:03.260]  porcelain. They're not showing the porcelain. So like it would be snap on, snap off to that.
[35:03.260 --> 35:08.340]  That's like the the face plate. Yeah, that would have like the Gears of War logo on. Yeah.
[35:10.080 --> 35:15.440]  While we're showing fucking weird British pictures, Emily and I walked into a pub because
[35:15.440 --> 35:19.380]  that's where everybody eats in England. And so we both fucking were stopped in our tracks. I'd
[35:19.380 --> 35:24.920]  never seen anything like this before. I'm going to show this to you guys. All of the ketchup was
[35:24.920 --> 35:32.200]  at the exact same level. That's that's crazy. That's how does that happen? I'm sure there's a
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.220]  picture of twenty five bottles of ketchup. It's like a P. Diddy party, but instead of baby oil,
[35:37.300 --> 35:41.840]  it's ketchup. And they all have like an eighth of a bottle left, but it's a uniform across the
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.880]  board. How does that happen? I think I've only ever used ketchup in a restaurant or a pub at
[35:46.880 --> 35:53.040]  that level. I've never had a full one. That must be a British thing, because we looked at it for
[35:53.040 --> 35:57.700]  like five minutes. Just it floored us. Do you think there's someone there who's a real big fan
[35:57.700 --> 36:02.840]  of rotation? He's like trying to keep the levels the same. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.420]  I think Nick really appreciates it. I think Nick sees it and he's like, this is good.
[36:06.860 --> 36:11.700]  There's some symmetry there that is otherworldly. Also, we watched TV. We watched one game show
[36:11.700 --> 36:16.580]  at night before we went to bed one night. And I completely and totally understand Gavin in a new
[36:16.580 --> 36:24.400]  way. Oh, yeah. It was a show, a British show about words. And you have to pick out the meaning of the
[36:24.400 --> 36:30.720]  words. These are the words in the British game show. Twiffler. Testicel. Twiffler. Twinkle.
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.580]  Throttlebottom. Tootsie-cum. Who leaked my next Wormsteak?
[36:39.500 --> 36:51.060]  What the? Throttlebasket. Throttlebottom. What? What the hell? I get you, Gav. I understand now.
[36:51.060 --> 37:00.260]  You're not weird. You just watch TV in England. It was a lot of fun. I thought being in England
[37:00.260 --> 37:05.560]  was really good. Did you ever talk about the custom drink that you guys had, Gavin?
[37:05.880 --> 37:12.680]  No. We were going to do a bunch of custom cocktails based on cat puns from our cat's
[37:12.680 --> 37:18.500]  names. And then it was really expensive to add a custom cocktail because I guess they have to buy
[37:18.500 --> 37:23.000]  shit. So we just did one. And we called it the Long Island Diced Smee.
[37:23.180 --> 37:32.340]  It was so good. I think I had two. They were fantastic. And then everyone who went up and got
[37:32.340 --> 37:39.400]  one spent so long telling the bartenders about the evil cat. And the bartenders did not care.
[37:40.380 --> 37:46.220]  We just kept going, no, no, no. You're not listening. This cat's so mean. It's crazy.
[37:46.220 --> 37:49.500]  And they're like, okay, thank you. Here it is.
[37:49.640 --> 37:53.020]  There's like international war stories about this cat. Like people...
[37:53.800 --> 37:55.620]  That cat tried to bite me the other day.
[37:55.760 --> 37:57.660]  Yep, yep, yep. Evil cat.
[37:57.660 --> 37:57.980]  It's hungry.
[37:58.520 --> 38:02.520]  Oh, God. Oh, how's your office? Filled with cat piss still or what's up?
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.840]  Oh, yeah. I think being out of the house sort of reset my nostrils and I came back in and it was
[38:08.840 --> 38:09.480]  potent.
[38:11.220 --> 38:15.780]  Based on how you previously talked about it, I felt like it was always potent. That it was never
[38:15.780 --> 38:16.380]  not potent.
[38:16.880 --> 38:18.440]  Well, I did start to get used to it, I think.
[38:19.020 --> 38:19.540]  Oh, no.
[38:19.920 --> 38:20.780]  Oh, God.
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.340]  But I locked the door when I was gone. So he was unable to use it again.
[38:25.920 --> 38:28.720]  But you just essentially bottled up the remaining piss smell.
[38:28.740 --> 38:34.100]  Yeah, was locking the door crucial? Like you had to lock it?
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.280]  Yeah, we talked about this. He can open doors. He opens handles.
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.700]  So I put the fingerprint lock on the bedroom one, but I didn't put one on my office.
[38:43.540 --> 38:48.080]  This cat's evil. It's an evil cat. It's just an evil cat.
[38:48.340 --> 38:53.900]  Watching him figure out sliding doors was really impressive. Like an external sliding door. He
[38:53.900 --> 38:59.700]  just wedges his nose in the gap and then wiggles his head and slowly pushes these giant heavy
[38:59.700 --> 39:03.420]  doors apart. It takes him like five minutes, but he can he can open them.
[39:03.800 --> 39:05.860]  Gonna see it trying to like scan its paw.
[39:06.580 --> 39:10.340]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. It's going to learn how to like reset and then like
[39:10.340 --> 39:15.000]  its paw will be the new fingerprint. I watched Jeff walk inside past the sliding
[39:15.000 --> 39:21.040]  glass doors past the cat and the cat didn't like that. So it took a bite at Jeff. But I don't know
[39:21.040 --> 39:27.540]  that there was actual intent. It was just like, why did you do that? Like, it was really it was
[39:27.540 --> 39:31.400]  really weird. I don't think I've ever seen a cat bite at someone without trying to actually bite
[39:31.400 --> 39:34.140]  them. It was very strange. Just give me a warning shot.
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.260]  I just imagine trying to scan the paw and then the next day just has a finger.
[39:39.260 --> 39:42.580]  It has found a finger somewhere in between.
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.840]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.900]  blended iced coffee you know and love now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar

[40:23.940 --> 40:29.100]  We probably won't get to it, but we came up with a bunch of a bunch of good question prompts and
[40:29.100 --> 40:34.460]  stuff at the wedding for for different things for the website. What website? What? For the
[40:34.460 --> 40:39.700]  podcast. Fucking where'd I get website from? What's wrong with you? I don't know. JeffSucks.com?
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.560]  Regulatrion? Do we want to talk about one of them? Do we want to talk about um uh
[40:47.500 --> 40:51.420]  I kind of want to because I've been curious about it. Yeah, do you want to queue it up? Which one?
[40:51.460 --> 40:57.180]  Yeah, so we talked about a few different things, but uh one of the ones that we said was uh
[40:57.680 --> 41:06.300]  if the podcasts were to have like if one of us died, um which person dying would
[41:06.300 --> 41:14.320]  affect the podcast the least? Me. Okay, so I said me. I said me. Uh-huh.
[41:18.420 --> 41:22.820]  Thoughts? I think we can all I think we can all agree that Nick is the most important person in
[41:22.820 --> 41:26.780]  the podcast. Yeah, it wouldn't exist. Nick's number one. Nick, you're safe, you get to live forever.
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.560]  My reasoning was Nick's important to make it work. Um, Andrew's a freak.
[41:34.840 --> 41:41.280]  Calm down, glory hole boy. Relax. You're a crazy person and it's it's a hell of a lot of good
[41:41.280 --> 41:48.560]  content. Jeff's kind of the the host. Mm-hmm. And Eric makes sure we all show up. I'm the least
[41:48.560 --> 41:55.260]  important member of the podcast. Allow me to counter that. Uh, Nick's off the table. Andrew's
[41:55.260 --> 42:03.860]  absolutely the, uh, just bizarre heart of the podcast. Like he he fuels it. He's the engine,
[42:03.920 --> 42:10.180]  right? Eric has to manage it. Gavin, you and I are largely redundant, except you are younger
[42:10.180 --> 42:17.580]  and more successful than me. So if somebody's got to go, it's me. I will say I've seen Gavin
[42:17.580 --> 42:24.380]  I've seen Gavin try to host things and it's not I wasn't built for it. Yeah, it's not it's
[42:24.380 --> 42:29.640]  definitely not a thing he naturally enjoys doing. Yeah, I guess. Okay, so we have so we have
[42:29.640 --> 42:37.020]  answers from myself, Gavin and Jeff. Nick and Andrew, what do you guys think? I'm taking out
[42:37.020 --> 42:44.820]  Nick and just ending the whole thing. Let's just sink the whole ship. Let's just get rid of Nick
[42:44.820 --> 42:50.580]  and just end the whole series. What's crazy is that without Nick, we we all still make it.
[42:50.580 --> 42:53.020]  Nothing changes for us, but no one hears it.
[42:58.760 --> 43:01.360]  Craig is the only person that hears our podcast.
[43:03.480 --> 43:06.080]  Craig gets a 20% ownership stake.
[43:10.280 --> 43:14.560]  Yeah, I don't know that. I think that's the funniest. Nick, I love you. I'm going to kill
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.400]  you just because it's might as well go nuclear. If one of us is going to die. Yeah, that is a
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.560]  amazing answer. You are the most immune. That was one of my favorite things about the original
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.820]  F*** Face, though, is that when I was still doing a lot of the other stuff at Rooster Teeth, I was
[43:28.820 --> 43:33.760]  like, oh, I like I like F*** Face because I'm the least important part of it. It felt nice.
[43:35.480 --> 43:38.600]  Little did you know you weren't the least important part of it. Sorry, man. It was Nick.
[43:41.300 --> 43:47.100]  No, there's something really funny about being in a room like imagine a room with a gun that
[43:47.100 --> 43:53.140]  has one bullet and we have to kill somebody and everybody agrees this one guy can't be killed and
[43:53.140 --> 44:00.360]  then somebody just shooting that person in the face is really funny. And are you following that
[44:00.360 --> 44:05.760]  up with an immunity bullet? Oh, yeah. Well, you shoot it straight in the sky, you know, that way.
[44:07.060 --> 44:11.480]  I declare me and I fire the immunity bullet into the sky,
[44:11.540 --> 44:15.660]  then realize the gun has no other ammo because I misunderstood the purpose.
[44:17.780 --> 44:23.660]  Of my crime. Oh, man, it's so good. Oh, that's even more embarrassing. I thought that that I
[44:23.660 --> 44:26.640]  thought maybe that was the way that question was going to go, where it was going to be. Everyone
[44:26.640 --> 44:34.360]  going me, me, me, me. And then one person going, Nick, and then end the whole series. Yeah. What
[44:34.360 --> 44:40.360]  the hell? Oh, man. Oh, my God. I mean, I did say Andrew was the freak, but it was Eric that a few
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.300]  weeks ago suggested catching a swordfish backwards in your ass. Yeah. Well, then you
[44:45.860 --> 44:50.560]  everyone's been on a run. I love the fucking the community on Reddit was like, technically,
[44:50.740 --> 45:00.020]  it'd be too big. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, guys. Yeah. Technically,
[45:00.020 --> 45:06.220]  I think you're correct. It's so it's probably won't actually try to do it now.
[45:06.540 --> 45:10.240]  Just not understanding what we're doing, but thinking that we're hypothesizing.
[45:10.240 --> 45:17.740]  If this what do you think a chance would happen if such a thing were to occur?
[45:18.360 --> 45:24.740]  I'm imagining John Locke with a fish halfway in his anus just yelling, Don't tell me what I can't
[45:24.740 --> 45:37.040]  do. Oh, Christ. You're saying this is impossible. Look at me. It's just a man with a swordfish
[45:37.040 --> 45:45.280]  his ass. Has anyone ever fired a gun with their anus? Oh, yeah. Well, with their anus is tough,
[45:45.340 --> 45:49.360]  but like with your anus is tough. I just don't know how you do it. Do you like you like shove
[45:49.360 --> 45:54.000]  a string up there and then like hope that your clench can like pull a trigger? You know what
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.440]  I mean? Like tie it. I don't know. That's tough. If it's like a hair trigger, maybe if you could
[45:59.440 --> 46:04.240]  like clench your butt cheeks real hard, it could it could trigger it. You know, you just have to
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.300]  clench the whole gun, though. I don't know how you would localize the trigger. I guess you just
[46:09.300 --> 46:13.620]  have to try to shake hard enough. We should read up and see if it's ever been done. I bet I bet a
[46:13.620 --> 46:20.000]  lot of people have fired a gun with a wiener. Oh, that's what I'm that's what I'm thinking of. Let
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.100]  me hear. Let me drop this image in the chat. My brain immediately went to imagine. No, not a
[46:26.100 --> 46:32.000]  literal, not a literal person using their dick to fire. Oh, I was posted a dick in the chat. I'm
[46:33.260 --> 46:39.860]  Tom Savini's weapon. And from dusk till dawn. Oh, the idea of like somebody spreading their
[46:39.860 --> 46:46.200]  cheeks and that little barrel comes out of the asshole. Tom, Tom Savini's dead now, huh? He's
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.540]  been dead for a little bit. I don't think so. I think Tom Savini is very much alive. Well,
[46:50.540 --> 46:55.180]  I hope I didn't just let me see. Let me look. I mean, he's definitely alive.
[46:55.180 --> 47:02.120]  He's 77. Thank God Tom Savini's still around. Oh, my God. He's one year older than Alice Cooper.
[47:03.480 --> 47:08.680]  Oh, man. He's been dead for a little bit. I remember reading that he died, but I guess he
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.940]  didn't. No, I get it. I have those. Yeah. You just get something wrong. Well, I just I don't
[47:14.940 --> 47:20.120]  remember. There's an actor that I constantly think is dead and I've been corrected like four
[47:20.120 --> 47:24.280]  different times. I don't remember who they are right now, so I'm sure I currently think they're
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.880]  dead and I'll be corrected again in the future. It's like another version of guess who might be
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.980]  dead. Hey, we we should also mention I don't know if we want to get into the results or save it for
[47:34.980 --> 47:40.740]  the video, but we did before we went out of town, filmed some supplemental content, including
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.300]  making potatoes, because last episode, 21, we discussed the mash hash cash bash.
[47:46.820 --> 47:53.200]  What was it called? The mash hash cash bash bash. Open faced mash hash cash.
[47:53.800 --> 47:59.360]  OK, so you remember. So he doesn't know either. No, it is the open faced mash hash cash. You're
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.880]  right. So anyway, so we did actually get into the lab and create potatoes and filmed a video.
[48:05.980 --> 48:10.780]  I'm very excited to come out. I'm very excited to see it. What it really did is just remind me
[48:10.780 --> 48:14.920]  that we've really got to get out the previous batch of supplemental. There's so much. Yeah.
[48:14.920 --> 48:19.780]  Video supplemental to come out. Audio supplemental. We've got a lot. I'll get
[48:19.780 --> 48:25.000]  working on that. Man, I'm behind on stuff. Yeah, it's like you've been in the middle of stuff and
[48:25.000 --> 48:29.700]  had other things on your mind for like the last few months, man. That's been so much from like
[48:29.700 --> 48:35.880]  I do after the wedding. Oh, yes, that's now. I've got all this stuff now. So when I was you know,
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.260]  I was thinking, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, Andrew. Go ahead. It's just a
[48:39.260 --> 48:43.940]  tie on that very quickly. Just a quick note. And I don't blame you at all, Gavin.
[48:43.940 --> 48:48.940]  But it's very funny where, you know, it's been like we've known that you're going to be gone
[48:48.940 --> 48:56.480]  for a while. And so I wanted to make sure that we had some Halloween content ready to go just to
[48:56.480 --> 49:02.380]  make sure it's in the can. And so we recorded a bunch of Halloween, three different Halloween
[49:02.380 --> 49:07.600]  based Let's Plays that I figured could be edited while everybody is away and then we can start
[49:07.600 --> 49:14.300]  releasing them as soon as October starts. And I got a note while Gavin was at his wedding
[49:14.300 --> 49:22.620]  overseas that Gavin had not uploaded his footage or audio for any of the three. Complete miss.
[49:24.020 --> 49:28.920]  All three. We got to we got to get ahead of all this stuff. I've got to get it all done before
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.320]  I leave town. And then I just basically had the exact same effect as if I never showed up.
[49:33.320 --> 49:37.240]  Exactly. But no, actually worse because you were part of all of it.
[49:37.260 --> 49:42.500]  So we couldn't. It was just pending, which was so funny. Yeah. And if you'd never showed up,
[49:42.580 --> 49:46.200]  we could have pivoted and still figured out something that could have been releasable.
[49:46.380 --> 49:50.800]  Yeah. Oh, so good. You sent me that Slyke. I was like,
[49:51.240 --> 49:57.740]  all of them, all three of them. I can't do anything about that for a while. It's real funny.
[49:57.740 --> 50:05.980]  Oh, hopefully now that now that all that this is done, I can get out of my dumb era
[50:05.980 --> 50:10.540]  because it's pretty detrimental to my productivity. Is this a screenshot?
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.700]  It's Nick being like, yeah, you've been on a run.
[50:17.460 --> 50:21.060]  That one's even worse. Fuck. That one is.
[50:23.320 --> 50:24.760]  I didn't record it.
[50:27.740 --> 50:31.140]  The horror movie auction. I don't have anything for that one.
[50:31.580 --> 50:35.720]  That's funny. I either deleted it or I'd never press record.
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.880]  It's so, so hard being this dumb. So when you do the sink,
[50:42.980 --> 50:44.680]  why do you think it is that we sink?
[50:55.600 --> 50:59.280]  He said that recently and it just is so fucking funny.
[50:59.280 --> 51:04.060]  We did a let's play in a game where it was very clear what platform we were playing on and
[51:04.060 --> 51:09.400]  Gavin bought it on a different platform anyway. And just realizing what he had done, just the
[51:09.400 --> 51:14.820]  exasperated. It is so every day I wake up like this and it's not great.
[51:20.460 --> 51:23.500]  The human body needs it. He's rest and sleep.
[51:24.380 --> 51:28.840]  It's been a rough year for everybody, and you have had a lot on your plate
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.180]  getting ready for. I remember what it was like the months leading up to my wedding,
[51:32.320 --> 51:38.040]  and I wasn't needing to keep it secret and stuff, too. It's a lot to weigh on you.
[51:38.160 --> 51:41.700]  Now that you're past that, buddy, you're going to get smart again. You will.
[51:42.140 --> 51:42.980]  We'll see. I hope so.
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.280]  Did you upload that stuff yet? Those let's play? Thanks.
[51:50.140 --> 51:53.080]  If you can get on that when we're done, that'd be great.
[51:54.440 --> 51:56.400]  We'd like him to come out for next October.
[51:58.080 --> 51:59.700]  I'll get those up. Okay.
[52:01.140 --> 52:05.920]  On it. That's that's if I've recorded.
[52:07.860 --> 52:12.460]  But the reason I'm asking Nick for did we do it before after is that I had
[52:12.980 --> 52:17.980]  I had the Halloween candy and the video after it. Yeah. So when he said after I was like, oh,
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.700]  you want to check right now? What am I looking for?
[52:23.700 --> 52:26.200]  Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2.
[52:27.680 --> 52:30.900]  Two videos, right? Two videos, two audio.
[52:31.560 --> 52:36.300]  Yeah. Left 4 Dead part one and part two. Oh, why is part one? Why is part one after part two?
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.720]  I don't know. That's probably fine. What was the other one?
[52:41.180 --> 52:43.240]  Outlast Trials. Got all that.
[52:43.820 --> 52:49.680]  That's probably fine is what you're going with. That's probably that's good enough, maybe.
[52:50.080 --> 52:51.540]  For now. He's got both.
[52:52.180 --> 52:56.760]  I've got both and they're different sizes. I just did I save one before the other?
[52:56.820 --> 52:59.720]  How would I have done that? Yeah, that's what you did.
[53:01.080 --> 53:05.460]  Yeah. Introducing our new supplemental series. How would I have done that?
[53:07.180 --> 53:10.160]  We tried to reverse engineer our stupidity.
[53:12.440 --> 53:15.180]  Reverse engineered stupidity is a great title for an episode.
[53:16.900 --> 53:20.460]  We recorded a supplemental, Gavin, while you were away
[53:20.460 --> 53:23.640]  that you were going to be part of, but you didn't.
[53:24.080 --> 53:26.780]  Well, you're busy. I sent you a thing to submit for it.
[53:27.220 --> 53:31.880]  I'm so excited to see you take part in that because I feel like you are going to really struggle.
[53:32.260 --> 53:36.660]  It is a game of deception where you're trying to figure out who is
[53:37.340 --> 53:43.020]  both you as a player and you as an evaluator, I think is going to be so fucking funny.
[53:44.660 --> 53:48.340]  It's we did it with Nick and then Eric and Jeff were the
[53:48.340 --> 53:53.580]  deceiver role people. And how it works is I will say an opinion that is like,
[53:53.580 --> 53:58.000]  I'll ask a question like, what is a move you hate? And one of them was Napoleon Dynamite.
[53:58.320 --> 54:04.100]  And then so I'll state that. And then Nick has to listen to Eric and Jeff, try to convince him
[54:04.100 --> 54:09.180]  that that is what they submitted. Or it could be something that you or I submitted.
[54:09.480 --> 54:13.140]  It's either an opinion they have or neither of them have it. And they're trying to convince them
[54:13.580 --> 54:17.940]  of it. Oh, I'm screwed. Oh, it's going to be so good. I can't wait.
[54:18.260 --> 54:22.040]  There was one flip. And if this is too much information, feel free to cut it out or bleep
[54:22.040 --> 54:25.580]  it. But there was one flip in it. And we'll use Napoleon Dynamite as an example. But this isn't
[54:25.580 --> 54:34.260]  the example in the episode where. Andrew goes, OK, favorite movie, Napoleon Dynamite,
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.420]  Eric and Jeff go. And we had to both tell Nick why it was our favorite movie,
[54:39.480 --> 54:42.860]  right, and why we wrote that down. And then as soon as we get done and he makes his choice,
[54:43.620 --> 54:47.560]  Andrew goes, OK, least favorite movie, Napoleon Dynamite, go.
[54:49.260 --> 54:54.760]  Two separate people submitted the same title for favorite and least favorite.
[54:55.060 --> 54:59.600]  And it was perfect. Oh, my God, dude, it was it was it was something.
[55:00.320 --> 55:03.060]  When does that come out? I've no idea. We've got so much.
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.260]  Nick is saying it's out by the time this episode is out.
[55:06.260 --> 55:06.880]  This Sunday? Yeah.
[55:07.220 --> 55:10.360]  Or this? Yeah. Oh, yeah, it is out. Yeah, we did a poll and it won. Yeah.
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.800]  Yeah. It's very it was it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun. I'm excited to see Gavin do it.
[55:15.840 --> 55:16.900]  Same. Yeah.
[55:17.100 --> 55:22.560]  Speaking of fun and things that we've done recently, we had this whole discussion two
[55:22.560 --> 55:28.780]  episodes ago now about the the mythical $50,000 bonus that doesn't exist, that won't ever exist
[55:28.780 --> 55:34.240]  and how to get a hot dog. Yeah. Yeah. And that got me thinking we should just film that. Right.
[55:34.260 --> 55:37.540]  Like we should all make hot dog gloves and try to play catch together and see how
[55:37.540 --> 55:43.220]  and put fully dressed hot dogs and see how messy we get and just try to have a game of catch with a
[55:43.220 --> 55:47.720]  bunch of hot dog gloves and baseballs. Like, why wouldn't we do that? How do you make the hot dog?
[55:48.780 --> 55:53.540]  You make a hot dog and then you, you know, make a take a hot dog bun. You put a hot dog in it.
[55:53.560 --> 55:58.680]  You put whatever you would put. I like onions and some ketchup and mustard and probably some
[55:58.680 --> 56:03.260]  some relish on it. And I put that in my hand. And then Eric throws a baseball at my face and I try
[56:03.260 --> 56:07.520]  to catch it with that hand. You're hearing hot dog glove as if it is a thing that we must
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.060]  create that is a glove in some way. Oh, like a physical. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. And if you if you
[56:12.060 --> 56:18.400]  think back a couple episodes, it just was catch ball with hot dogs. Yes. Yeah. I just assumed
[56:18.400 --> 56:23.380]  like with the hot dog in your hand, it's essentially becomes a glove, right? Sure. Totally. I was just
[56:23.380 --> 56:29.440]  trying to imagine like how like are you slicing the hot dog and hat? Like, how are you bridging
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.440]  to make a glove? I was not thinking like singular dog. Oh, yeah. I didn't mean to confuse you with
[56:34.440 --> 56:39.900]  the glove word with the G word. I just want to catch a play a game of catch with the just
[56:39.900 --> 56:45.640]  fucking shitty covered in hot dog juice and fucking mustard and ketchup baseball.
[56:46.380 --> 56:50.600]  So should we all stand in front of the pitching machine and see how we get on with our crafted
[56:50.600 --> 56:56.600]  hot dogs? Yes. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. We'll have one attempt to that. It'll be
[56:56.600 --> 57:05.060]  much. Do you think you could bind a hot dog to a bun with just cheese or would it be too heavy?
[57:05.540 --> 57:09.300]  You could try. I'm trying to think of like if you wanted to do like a real glove,
[57:09.360 --> 57:18.520]  if you put a hot dog bun on each finger like Freddy Krueger and then opened them up,
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.940]  but then you need a dog. So I was trying to think of what you could bind a hot dog to a bun
[57:24.160 --> 57:30.180]  to cheese is, I think, the best option. I mean, you could also just sew it all together if you
[57:30.180 --> 57:34.600]  wanted to get like real about it. Well, that it's not edible then. Yeah. Then I feel like that's
[57:34.600 --> 57:39.300]  unless you saw it with cheese still got to be edible. Oh, that was interesting.
[57:40.960 --> 57:47.260]  Like a cheddar Rambo, just like you together. You sew it together with nerds ropes.
[57:49.420 --> 57:50.380]  Cheddar stitch.
[57:54.220 --> 57:57.640]  Oh, anyway, I thought that'd be something disgusting we could do.
[57:58.800 --> 58:06.120]  Can you imagine cheese stitches? Sounds good. Oh, getting like shot in a movie using a
[58:06.120 --> 58:11.880]  cheese string, try to patch it up. If there was just a hot dog dog,
[58:11.940 --> 58:15.720]  like the Frankfurt, but it was stitched up and down with cheese. I think that'd be really good.
[58:16.060 --> 58:21.080]  Oh, well, I mean, they do ones with cheese in the middle,
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.000]  not stitched, but just like they got cheese on the inside.
[58:24.440 --> 58:28.280]  You said buns that have cheese on the inside? No, no, no. He said dogs. He's talking about
[58:28.280 --> 58:31.640]  dogs. Dogs. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's that's my preferred dog, actually.
[58:32.500 --> 58:35.220]  Cheese filled dog. Hell yeah. Would you have more than one of those, Gavin?
[58:36.820 --> 58:42.560]  I think so. But I'm just the dollar hot dog wasn't for me. I've got to go more premium.
[58:42.980 --> 58:46.180]  I had a hot dog in England that was very mediocre, by the way.
[58:46.540 --> 58:50.700]  I have a question about hot dogs that I'd like all of your opinions on.
[58:51.540 --> 58:56.000]  Uh, I have a weird situation that I had never thought about with the hot dog count.
[58:56.500 --> 59:04.120]  I had a hot dog. I ate about 85 percent of it, and then it tasted weird from the first bite,
[59:04.200 --> 59:09.900]  but I kept going and it made me sick. And I didn't know, does that count as a hot?
[59:10.360 --> 59:14.840]  Can I put that on the count or not? I think so. We talked about this, right?
[59:15.140 --> 59:20.020]  Yeah, we had a conversation at at baseball or at like dollar hot dog night where I think my
[59:20.020 --> 59:25.360]  wife was getting into it with Gavin about like, I see how much of the hot dog counts as one,
[59:25.420 --> 59:30.320]  like, you know, one eaten hot dog. And Gavin went 51 percent and she went,
[59:30.780 --> 59:36.640]  how could you tell what 51 percent of a hot, like, what are you talking about?
[59:36.640 --> 59:42.560]  That I wanted, that I wanted to cut a hot dog into 51 and 49 percent halves.
[59:44.860 --> 59:48.020]  I think she hates talking to me.
[59:52.040 --> 59:57.660]  I think I think she and I are very similar where it's just the immediacy of what the
[59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.180]  fuck are you talking about? I think there's just a very low tolerance for it.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:09.120]  I also said it's against the spirit of the competition to go like 51 percent a hot dog.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.860]  So I think if you got to like, you know, 80, 85 percent, it made you sick,
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.480]  you know, like you made an effort to eat this dog.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.040]  A hundred percent. OK, well, then I'll update my count.
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:23.380]  I feel like the number we all kind of settled on and I might be remembering this wrong because I am
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.940]  in my dumb era, too, and I have remembered a lot of stuff wrong in the last couple of months.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.300]  Embarrassingly so. But I feel like we came to around the like 75 percent
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.840]  range was what we felt like. If you can if you can put you put down like three
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.120]  quarters of a hot dog, that should count. But I think it only counts for the final dog.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.760]  Like you can't just see a bunch of 75. I was about to say the same thing,
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.340]  because what what was going to happen if we didn't say that right now?
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.080]  It was just going to be people posting going like, did I eat all the look at this?
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.760]  I eat these dogs. And then here's a bunch of 25 percent. And it's like,
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.700]  no, it has to be like your last one. You can't just keep eating
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.980]  three quarter dogs like there's a spirit to this whole thing, guys.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.420]  Like, it's not it's not a race. It's not a race. Not a competition competition.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.740]  Not a competition. Kicking your fucking asses, though.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:16.200]  Number 18, 18 hot dogs, baby, including one very mediocre British hot dog.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.120]  Wait, Andrew, so were you waiting for a ruling on this?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.460]  Yes. You just add it to your hot dog.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.000]  Yeah, yeah. I've been right now on Slack. Your number just went up.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.640]  Yeah, I've just been waiting. I didn't want to submit it until I got an approval from everybody
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:33.160]  else. Nice. And it was you said it wasn't good and it made you throw up.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.020]  Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah, it was bad.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.780]  You actually hurled or you just felt a bit funny?
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.400]  No, I like it. It messed up my stomach. It was not great.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.960]  It was one of those things where you take one bite and it's like this something something ain't
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.480]  right about this. I don't know what went wrong with this, but this is not good.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.900]  And I kept I kept trucking through.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.980]  Was it one that you made or you bought?
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.280]  Bought.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.120]  Okay.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.380]  It was a bought dog.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.460]  Is your dog toaster in in rotation now that the dog contest is happening?
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.000]  No, it's not. It hasn't left the closet.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:04.900]  That's insane.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.200]  I don't know where it is.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.480]  The fact that you've got one of those and you're not using it in the dog era is pretty
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:11.440]  nuts.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.220]  Did you just say it hasn't left the did you just say it hasn't left the closet and then
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.240]  immediately follow up with I don't know where it is?
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.420]  Well, it's it's somewhere. There's a lot of stuff in the closet that I have.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.580]  So it's it's somewhere in there.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.360]  Can you imagine that as a supplemental?
[01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.000]  You got a whole bag.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.040]  You've got a giant bag of sauce and McDonald's BTS sauce in there.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.500]  Probably like 40 pounds of pancake mix.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.560]  50 inch TV from 2009.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.580]  That's a bag of fire extinguisher goo.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:49.760]  Yeah.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.520]  Oh, no, I think I got rid of that.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.660]  I think that's gone.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.180]  Pretty sure that's too much.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.140]  I hope that's gone.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.520]  I'm just looking in.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.880]  I got a giant Hulk thing.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.180]  It's it's it's a lot.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.760]  I don't use it.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:02.700]  It's filled.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.700]  Have have you guys seen the movie Monkey Man?
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.840]  No, not yet.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.680]  Yeah, I didn't.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.880]  I kind of wanted to see it because it looked good, but I thought the name was kind of silly.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.540]  But I watched it on the plane.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.920]  Just highly recommend it.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.640]  That's all very fucking good, though.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.120]  It's about 75 percent shooting and punching.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.040]  Yeah, it's pretty action paced all the way through that guy.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.920]  Dev Patel is awesome.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.840]  So I think he got pretty messed up making it.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.480]  Didn't he got hurt?
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.480]  I mean, he got stabbed a lot in the movie.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.700]  I'll say that.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.840]  It's a violent, violent film.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.160]  Great.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.380]  Great for a great for a plane ride.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:38.940]  Yeah.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.260]  I watched Bad Boys 2, then Bad Boys 1, then Bad Boys Ride or Die.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.680]  Is that your preferred order?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.300]  Yeah, I think not watching Bad Boys for life.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.740]  Like there was like that third one that I forgot that they made or whatever.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.020]  Like not watching that one, I think, did me OK.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.080]  Insane that they took that name on a movie that wasn't the fourth one.
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.440]  Wait, so Eric, you saw the most recent Bad Boys.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.300]  I did.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:00.660]  Yeah.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.520]  Dude, Reggie, Reggie.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.560]  Dude, Reggie is like, he's the movie.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:07.820]  Here's the thing.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.820]  I think we might need to draft greatest ancillary characters of all time.
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.240]  And Reggie might be number one.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:13.860]  That's what I said.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.600]  He has three films, two, three and four of Bad Boys.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.380]  And it is maybe the greatest cinematic arc in film history.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.200]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.240]  It's so cool.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.640]  I also watched that movie on the plane and I felt bad for talking shit about it,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.780]  having not seen it, because I quite enjoyed it for the most part.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.240]  I really liked it.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.600]  And Reggie was fucking amazing.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.540]  And it ended on Reggie.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.760]  It ended on Reggie, baby.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.420]  That's the next Bad Boys five life.
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.240]  And it's fucking Reggie, baby.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:43.540]  What is a spoiler?
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.440]  What's the spoiler there?
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.000]  It just ended on the character.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.260]  I didn't say what he was doing.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.000]  Wait, wait.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.360]  You said, how is it a spoiler that described how the film ended?
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.620]  It ended on Reggie.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.100]  What is that?
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]  What's the spoiler there?
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.780]  Would it be a spoiler if I said it ended?
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:00.660]  Oh, OK.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.380]  Does anybody really think Reggie is going to fucking die in the film?
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.320]  It could have happened.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.340]  No way.
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.140]  It ended on Will Smith.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.340]  Oh, no, he didn't die.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.920]  Nobody thought he was going to die.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.620]  Didn't he almost die in the last one?
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.120]  Yeah.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.300]  Yeah, I guess he did.
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.860]  That was the whole point of three, wasn't it?
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.000]  Yeah, I think there's something wrong with Martin Lawrence.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:26.220]  I think whatever they filmed was like the last stuff at the end of the movie.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.360]  I think there's something wrong with him.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.800]  You can see a difference.
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.100]  You can tell when they did reshoots.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.640]  He looked real tired.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.380]  He looked real tired.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.980]  I think it's his best bad boys.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.480]  I think what they do with the Martin Lawrence character in that film, I really enjoyed.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.240]  It's fun.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.420]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.180]  We do need to start wrapping this episode up, though.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.700]  We do. We got to get to the end here.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:47.620]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.120]  I'm going to watch that bad boys movie now.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.800]  You should!
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.300]  Does anyone want to watch it with me?
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.280]  I'll watch bad boys with you, dude.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.120]  Let's do it.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.180]  Yeah, can't be this weekend.
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.800]  I have to go to another wedding on a different coast.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.400]  Hey, Eric, how's your mouth?
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.100]  Lost a temporary crown.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.880]  Coming back from London.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.440]  Got here, got a permanent crown on.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.620]  Lost the permanent crown.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.760]  Went back, got another permanent crown on, baby.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.880]  And that was right before this podcast started.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.520]  So did they just, they just put the one they made back on?
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:18.860]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.600]  They just cleaned the area and the dentist went, I don't know what happened.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.040]  I'm sorry.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.380]  I don't know why this didn't take.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.720]  And then started cleaning the area and everything and then went, oh, I think it's because you
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.920]  produce, you have very strong saliva glands in your mouth.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.580]  So I just went, what?
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.600]  And he's like, no, no, it's good.
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.820]  You want that?
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.180]  And I said, okay.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.660]  What are you, like a H.R. Giger alien?
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.140]  Yeah, I've got a Giger alien mouth, kind of.
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.220]  So there you go.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.520]  You got one of those Jurassic Park spinner mouths that's human.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.880]  Yeah, well, I'm constantly spitting at Wayne Knight.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.900]  So yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.300]  Do you have good distance on your spits?
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.940]  They're okay sometimes.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.220]  It depends on what I'm doing.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.240]  I tried to learn at a young age how to do like a baseball spit.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.700]  Like, you know, like when they have like a big...
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:13.400]  Like a tight...
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.720]  Yeah, you know, like that kind of goes, you know, like that.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:21.920]  But you got to be like really salivate up and, you know, I get there.
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.560]  I get there.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.660]  I went head to head against Jeff once and I lost.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.400]  That didn't surprise me at all.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:31.740]  I had and that was an un... I spit beyond my means that day.
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.180]  I would never be able to do that again.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.280]  It was just...
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:36.560]  One in a million.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.120]  It was a one in a million day.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.560]  It was just one of those days when you make up, you wake up and for like three minutes,
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.680]  you're Mickey Mantle, you know, and then it goes away.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.360]  I just can't keep my gobs together.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.820]  It always just goes in a spray and I lose velocity.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:51.680]  Tragic.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.100]  Man, that's worse than I thought.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.740]  Jesus Christ.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.280]  I thought it was a mild bubble.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.260]  Jesus Christ.
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.480]  I'm going to sleep tonight, man.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.840]  Oh, Christ.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.400]  All right.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.340]  Jesus Christ.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.800]  All right.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.200]  Well, there you go.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.380]  That was episode 22.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.140]  Is that what episode this was?
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.880]  Yeah, that was 22.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:28.300]  Yeah.

[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.300]  If you've already told them about it, remind them about it because they're not listening.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.760]  I don't know what they're fucking doing, but they're not listening.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.640]  And yeah, give us...
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.000]  Do we still do the stars like we used to do back when we were f***ed face?
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.120]  Give us all the stars.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.600]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.460]  We'll see you next time.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.640]  That helps.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:08.140]  And then go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.440]  I told a guy in the airport, he said he would check it out.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.980]  Hey, hey, boots on the ground, Gavin.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:14.440]  Thank you.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.360]  We should, we should do like the end of the Howard Stern show.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.660]  He's like, Fred, check out Fred Norris, King Norris playing Wednesdays at the knitting room.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.360]  Buy Celestial Glorbosis on Amazon.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:26.960]  Or don't.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:27.380]  I don't know.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.200]  All right.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.080]  Was I recording that one?
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.300]  Oh my God, come on.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.240]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.740]  All in the old can there.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.980]  Do we tail sync?
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:39.640]  I don't remember.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.820]  Yeah, we definitely should.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.860]  Yeah, we'll stop and then we restart and then we tail sync.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:44.060]  No!
