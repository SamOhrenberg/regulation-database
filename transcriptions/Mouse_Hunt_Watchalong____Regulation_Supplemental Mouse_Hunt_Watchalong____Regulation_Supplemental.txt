[01:30.440 --> 01:34.400]  Welcome, guys. We have a movie we're going to be watching tonight. However,
[01:35.260 --> 01:39.640]  I want to know, if you're in the chat, let us know, why did you pick this one and not the other
[01:39.640 --> 01:43.300]  movies? Or if you picked the other movies... Because this was the best.
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.820]  How are you feeling? Is that right? I think mine even had a little bit of nudity in it too,
[01:47.920 --> 01:50.040]  damn it. Oh, what? No!
[01:50.620 --> 01:52.920]  I don't think there's nudity in this one. No?
[01:53.340 --> 01:59.820]  There's a dead guy with some mouse nipples. Yeah, we're more hung up on tits than death.
[02:03.880 --> 02:09.600]  Because we will be watching Mouse Hunt. Mouse Hunt is the winner today.
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.300]  I thought, Andrew, whose pick was this? This was Gavin's pick.
[02:16.880 --> 02:18.660]  Gavin picked Mouse Hunt. Sure did.
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.600]  This is in recent lore because I was saying it's the third best Home Alone film.
[02:23.480 --> 02:25.600]  It's true. That's why this came up.
[02:25.960 --> 02:28.020]  I will judge that today, I guess. Yep.
[02:28.980 --> 02:30.760]  So who's alone? We will see if it's the third best.
[02:30.880 --> 02:33.820]  Is it the mouse? Yeah, the mouse is alone.
[02:34.040 --> 02:36.360]  Yeah, don't you think? Yeah, Mouse McAllister.
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.700]  Mouse McAllister? Fair enough.
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.420]  I gotta respect all of the Falcons in here who didn't vote for the film and are just here out
[02:46.420 --> 02:49.260]  of love anyway. Yeah, we'll appreciate you guys.
[02:49.360 --> 02:53.420]  Are there any of the 11% that voted for Air Force One currently in this chat?
[02:54.260 --> 02:56.880]  I don't know who's bummed that we're not watching Air Force One.
[02:58.020 --> 03:00.340]  Yeah, who picked? Outside of Nick.
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.040]  That was a Nick one, but who voted for it? Yeah, who voted for the right movie?
[03:05.240 --> 03:08.080]  SpencerTBL voted for Air Force One. Ethan?
[03:09.700 --> 03:12.540]  Is Gary Oldman in Air Force One? Who?
[03:13.100 --> 03:14.900]  Gary Oldman? Is that him? Okay.
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.540]  Yeah, he's main bad guy. Main bad guy, yes.
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.660]  I've never seen Air Force One. Yeah, neither have I.
[03:19.660 --> 03:22.040]  I probably would have voted for that. Well, you had the opportunity.
[03:22.420 --> 03:23.400]  That's true. You could have voted.
[03:23.560 --> 03:25.880]  You could have voted for it, Gavin. I'm not a Falcon.
[03:26.680 --> 03:31.980]  It's true. You could have voted the way that Nick does in every 100% eat poll.
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.240]  I don't do that anymore.
[03:35.960 --> 03:37.320]  It was a couple time thing.
[03:37.720 --> 03:40.420]  I'm not a Falcon. I'm just protected by them.
[03:40.640 --> 03:42.540]  Right, right, right. That's a good point.
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.760]  But now it's Mouse Hunt. We are recording this so that way you guys can do the watch
[03:46.760 --> 03:50.020]  along later if you're, for some reason, you have to leave early.
[03:50.560 --> 03:52.780]  Don't want you to have to go crazy out of your way for it.
[03:52.800 --> 03:54.800]  But we will be watching this with you guys.
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.440]  We got the chat up and then we're going to watch Mouse Hunt.
[03:59.740 --> 04:00.060]  It is...
[04:01.300 --> 04:02.720]  Do I have to sigh when you say it?
[04:02.740 --> 04:05.940]  And this is, according to Gavin, the third best Home Alone film.
[04:06.120 --> 04:09.540]  But what he doesn't mention is that he doesn't like Home Alone one and two.
[04:09.640 --> 04:12.200]  He's referring to three and four as the other two best Home Alone films,
[04:12.340 --> 04:13.540]  which I think is weird.
[04:13.740 --> 04:14.920]  No, I don't get that.
[04:15.700 --> 04:21.320]  So this is Mouse Hunt from 1997, a total run length of one hour, 38 minutes,
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.180]  directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Adam Rifkin.
[04:26.180 --> 04:27.260]  Still waiting on his Bioshock movie.
[04:28.060 --> 04:33.760]  Two stumblebum inheritors are determined to rid their antique house of a mouse
[04:33.760 --> 04:36.960]  who is equally determined to stay where he is.
[04:37.020 --> 04:40.960]  Starring Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, and Vicky Lewis.
[04:42.060 --> 04:42.900]  Vicky Lewis?
[04:43.180 --> 04:43.480]  Oh, man.
[04:44.340 --> 04:45.100]  Is that the name of the mouse?
[04:45.360 --> 04:45.480]  Yeah.
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.200]  No, Vicky Lewis was Beth on News Radio.
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.080]  Oh, I love News Radio.
[04:51.080 --> 04:52.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:54.160 --> 04:54.960]  So let's...
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.700]  Let's check this out.
[04:55.940 --> 04:58.040]  97 was such a good lead up year.
[04:58.460 --> 04:59.080]  It's true.
[04:59.280 --> 05:01.640]  A good pre-year, I guess.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.920]  It was a tailgater of a year.
[05:04.280 --> 05:04.460]  Yep.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.420]  I feel like it was a pre-year along with 93.
[05:07.360 --> 05:07.760]  93.
[05:08.080 --> 05:12.420]  I think 92 feels like a pre-year, but boy, I could really feel 93 as a pre-year.
[05:12.620 --> 05:14.420]  I could get on board with that big time.
[05:14.640 --> 05:15.620]  Let's see, I graduated high school.
[05:16.060 --> 05:18.400]  I think 95 was main year.
[05:18.860 --> 05:20.180]  I think 95 could be a main year.
[05:20.180 --> 05:22.420]  I think 94 is pretty close to being a main year, though.
[05:23.620 --> 05:25.960]  94 feels like a big year, doesn't it, Jeff?
[05:26.140 --> 05:26.280]  It was a big year.
[05:26.320 --> 05:26.860]  It was a big year.
[05:26.940 --> 05:27.700]  It was the year Kurt Cobain died.
[05:28.500 --> 05:29.160]  Oh, big year.
[05:30.020 --> 05:30.340]  Five.
[05:30.620 --> 05:32.720]  That sounded like Nick was making fun of you.
[05:33.000 --> 05:33.020]  Three.
[05:33.340 --> 05:33.960]  No, I like that.
[05:33.960 --> 05:35.220]  That's the first thing I think of in 94.
[05:35.680 --> 05:36.000]  I don't know why.
[05:36.840 --> 05:38.360]  No, Andrew, that's not the countdown.
[05:40.140 --> 05:40.820]  One, two, three.
[05:41.080 --> 05:42.080]  One, two, three.
[05:43.880 --> 05:44.380]  All right.
[05:44.560 --> 05:45.740]  Are you all ready?
[05:45.820 --> 05:46.060]  Let's do it.
[05:46.100 --> 05:46.900]  Yeah, I'll sleep tight.
[05:47.660 --> 05:55.000]  And for everybody listening later, in five, four, three, two, one, go.
[05:55.440 --> 05:57.060]  Oh, you almost lost the play button.
[05:57.180 --> 05:58.580]  I almost vanished.
[05:59.020 --> 06:00.040]  I had to keep moving it around.
[06:02.140 --> 06:03.480]  Framerate's a piece of shit.
[06:04.360 --> 06:05.260]  Why don't you do something about that, Nick?
[06:08.040 --> 06:09.340]  Catch the mouse!
[06:09.820 --> 06:11.360]  Move off the goddamn screen!
[06:11.860 --> 06:16.880]  It's like we did a test for this earlier and Gavin didn't have anything to say about this part.
[06:17.460 --> 06:18.840]  Oh, I didn't know about that.
[06:21.560 --> 06:22.900]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:24.220 --> 06:25.180]  Nick, what happened?
[06:25.280 --> 06:25.820]  What are you doing?
[06:26.300 --> 06:27.620]  What are you doing, Nick?
[06:27.780 --> 06:29.060]  A word without frames is chaos.
[06:29.280 --> 06:29.980]  Nick, what's happening?
[06:31.860 --> 06:34.500]  Do you want to take a second and restart?
[06:35.260 --> 06:35.960]  Restart what?
[06:36.040 --> 06:36.800]  What's the problem?
[06:37.620 --> 06:41.260]  I can't get the pause button to get off the screen.
[06:44.060 --> 06:48.180]  No, I think this is how Gore Verbinski wanted us to watch this.
[06:48.240 --> 06:52.620]  Oh wow, did you just have to not move the mouse for like seven seconds?
[06:53.140 --> 06:55.520]  I didn't move it for a very, very long time.
[06:55.540 --> 06:57.900]  This looks like the start of a Batman movie right here.
[06:57.920 --> 06:58.320]  It does.
[06:58.640 --> 06:59.520]  Yeah, or The Godfather.
[06:59.820 --> 07:02.200]  Well, Mouse Hunt is like the third best Batman movie.
[07:02.620 --> 07:03.460]  I've heard that.
[07:04.440 --> 07:07.160]  But once again, Gavin only likes Val Kilmer as Batman.
[07:12.030 --> 07:15.090]  And this is for the mouse?
[07:16.370 --> 07:17.170]  The coffin?
[07:17.750 --> 07:18.010]  Yeah.
[07:18.130 --> 07:19.010]  That's a big mouse.
[07:19.350 --> 07:20.550]  That's what I was saying.
[07:20.710 --> 07:21.590]  I don't think that's crazy.
[07:23.950 --> 07:25.750]  What's going on with the picture?
[07:26.510 --> 07:26.850]  What?
[07:27.710 --> 07:29.310]  It's jittering all over the place.
[07:29.510 --> 07:30.150]  Oh, what is it?
[07:30.210 --> 07:31.070]  Why are you doing that?
[07:31.650 --> 07:32.770]  Can everyone else see that?
[07:33.250 --> 07:34.390]  Nick has to move the mouse again.
[07:34.470 --> 07:34.790]  Hang on.
[07:35.010 --> 07:36.490]  Hey, Gavin, are you wired?
[07:37.670 --> 07:39.050]  There goes the frame rate!
[07:41.550 --> 07:42.410]  Oh, shit!
[07:42.850 --> 07:42.910]  Whoa!
[07:43.310 --> 07:43.790]  Hell yeah!
[07:43.870 --> 07:44.150]  No!
[07:45.090 --> 07:47.410]  Was that the uncle from Christmas Vacation?
[07:47.510 --> 07:49.510]  Yeah, it's the old guy from Christmas Vacation.
[07:50.630 --> 07:52.390]  His hair gets set on fire?
[07:52.850 --> 07:53.070]  Yeah.
[07:54.470 --> 07:56.510]  Nothing but net. How'd they do that?
[07:57.670 --> 07:59.330]  They're like, Jesus Christ, Edna!
[07:59.870 --> 08:02.930]  Sometimes the movie's playing backwards.
[08:03.710 --> 08:04.230]  What?
[08:05.530 --> 08:08.250]  Is there people not seeing the movie like skip backwards and forwards?
[08:08.790 --> 08:09.110]  No!
[08:09.270 --> 08:09.370]  Is it?
[08:09.370 --> 08:13.730]  No, Nick, no, it's not. There has not been any problem at all.
[08:14.030 --> 08:15.250]  We're watching Thread.
[08:15.730 --> 08:17.250]  Oh, I'm seeing a little bit. A little skippage.
[08:18.810 --> 08:19.870]  I'm not getting that.
[08:19.910 --> 08:21.310]  Not to the frequency in which Gavin is saying.
[08:21.310 --> 08:23.470]  I am not getting it. I'm not getting it at all.
[08:28.470 --> 08:29.730]  Okay, they'll see it.
[08:31.930 --> 08:32.370]  Smunts.
[08:32.910 --> 08:36.330]  Are they doing a thing or are they for real?
[08:36.330 --> 08:37.170]  That's a good question.
[08:38.410 --> 08:40.830]  I didn't know that streamer Ludwig is in this.
[08:40.830 --> 08:41.010]  Hold on.
[08:41.430 --> 08:41.970]  I'm going to vomit.
[08:42.150 --> 08:43.870]  Okay, we're going to hold up. We're going to hold on.
[08:43.970 --> 08:45.350]  We're going to hold on. That's fucking great.
[08:46.110 --> 08:48.370]  I know what to do. It's all right.
[08:48.770 --> 08:49.790]  Oh, what do you need to do?
[08:50.130 --> 08:53.090]  I'm just going to change the stream quality.
[08:53.470 --> 08:54.210]  Michael Jeter?
[08:55.650 --> 08:56.170]  Derek's brother?
[08:56.710 --> 08:56.890]  Yeah.
[08:59.070 --> 09:00.190]  See if that does a difference.
[09:01.570 --> 09:07.170]  I got to say, Zach Efron's brother is on the traders and he's pretty likable.
[09:07.710 --> 09:08.030]  Really?
[09:08.550 --> 09:10.430]  Yeah, he's pretty likable.
[09:12.250 --> 09:13.990]  Captain Stray's brother though.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.400]  This is looking better for me.
[09:19.660 --> 09:20.540]  How do you feel, Gavin?
[09:20.980 --> 09:21.760]  Yeah, it's looking right.
[09:22.120 --> 09:23.400]  You did a great job, Nick.
[09:23.940 --> 09:24.620]  Good job.
[09:25.700 --> 09:27.100]  It's looking so much better now.
[09:28.680 --> 09:30.680]  Do you think that barrel is a...
[09:30.680 --> 09:32.780]  Do you think that's a prop in Call of Duty or is it a real barrel?
[09:34.920 --> 09:37.000]  Let's wait 40 seconds and see if it whistles.
[09:39.580 --> 09:40.320]  Uh-oh.
[09:40.740 --> 09:43.480]  So the mouse did this?
[09:45.500 --> 09:46.020]  No.
[09:48.560 --> 09:50.820]  I just don't understand what this has to do with a mouse.
[09:51.760 --> 09:53.180]  The build-up to the mouse.
[09:53.760 --> 09:54.100]  Oh.
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.940]  This is how the mouse is born.
[09:56.260 --> 09:57.260]  This is his origin story.
[09:58.700 --> 09:59.780]  It is like Batman.
[10:00.380 --> 10:00.680]  Yeah.
[10:03.940 --> 10:05.400]  And he's made out of string?
[10:05.800 --> 10:07.700]  He's gonna fall into a vat of radioactive string.
[10:15.750 --> 10:17.130]  Now that I do see.
[10:20.790 --> 10:22.030]  Why is it doing that?
[10:24.110 --> 10:25.550]  Oh, there's string everywhere.
[10:28.430 --> 10:29.230]  Silly string?
[10:29.750 --> 10:30.490]  Do I...
[10:30.490 --> 10:33.270]  Is it jumping back and forth in time for anybody else or is it just me?
[10:33.270 --> 10:33.410]  Yeah.
[10:33.410 --> 10:33.770]  No.
[10:35.490 --> 10:38.510]  I have not had it jump back and forth in time.
[10:40.950 --> 10:42.210]  Well, then you would be in now.
[10:42.270 --> 10:45.030]  If you give me two seconds, I will fix it.
[10:45.290 --> 10:49.450]  But the movie will continue to run or we can start it over again for the people who are
[10:49.450 --> 10:50.150]  watching later.
[10:51.110 --> 10:51.970]  What are your thoughts?
[10:52.490 --> 10:53.170]  Just let it run.
[10:53.890 --> 10:54.010]  Okay.
[10:54.650 --> 10:55.270]  Two seconds.
[10:55.930 --> 10:56.110]  Okay.
[10:59.770 --> 11:03.310]  We tested this out before earlier today, you guys.
[11:03.410 --> 11:03.610]  Yep.
[11:04.890 --> 11:05.770]  That we did.
[11:07.970 --> 11:10.610]  All right, you're being a bit pedantic.
[11:13.730 --> 11:14.170]  One!
[11:17.090 --> 11:18.630]  Oh, Andrew's only up to one.
[11:19.450 --> 11:19.650]  Hold on.
[11:20.670 --> 11:21.470]  Oh, no.
[11:23.490 --> 11:23.930]  Two!
[11:24.950 --> 11:26.450]  Oh, you better hope...
[11:26.450 --> 11:28.510]  Nick, you better hope Andrew doesn't get the three.
[11:28.710 --> 11:29.290]  Now, look at that.
[11:29.350 --> 11:30.110]  That looks fantastic.
[11:30.610 --> 11:31.470]  Oh, he kicked out!
[11:34.070 --> 11:34.810]  That better?
[11:35.830 --> 11:36.710]  Yeah, Gavin, how does that look?
[11:37.010 --> 11:37.550]  Way better.
[11:39.150 --> 11:39.850]  Gavin left.
[11:42.030 --> 11:44.070]  Now it's out of sync with the audio.
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.180]  Yeah, now it is out of sync with the audio.
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.300]  Oh my god.
[11:52.280 --> 11:53.460]  How is this a company?
[11:54.500 --> 11:55.800]  It's hardly a company.
[11:56.320 --> 11:56.860]  That's a good point.
[11:57.800 --> 12:00.580]  Turns out you just got to throw LLC in front of some letters.
[12:03.280 --> 12:03.820]  That's right.
[12:03.820 --> 12:06.160]  You throw LLC in front of some letters.
[12:07.740 --> 12:10.320]  You spin a big wheel and you're like, hey, can I have a W?
[12:10.640 --> 12:13.300]  We're LLC regulation company.
[12:17.920 --> 12:18.840]  Now it's in sync.
[12:19.200 --> 12:19.840]  Now it's in sync.
[12:20.360 --> 12:20.700]  All right.
[12:21.840 --> 12:23.200]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[12:27.360 --> 12:27.640]  Nope.
[12:28.800 --> 12:30.220]  Sort of. Hard to tell.
[12:30.560 --> 12:32.660]  Sometimes movies just, I feel like, are a little out of sync.
[12:34.700 --> 12:35.820]  That's not true.
[12:36.200 --> 12:36.940]  That is true.
[12:37.060 --> 12:39.820]  Like whether they're a low budget film or they don't record the audio.
[12:40.660 --> 12:44.820]  You can have like shitty ADR, but usually not for the whole movie.
[12:45.600 --> 12:47.680]  Nick, I don't care that Eric Christmas is in this scene.
[12:48.780 --> 12:49.880]  I don't care that he is either.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.420]  I would like this to go away now.
[12:51.900 --> 12:52.280]  Do you?
[12:54.120 --> 12:55.760]  Do you think you should move them out somewhere else?
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.500]  Do you think you can do something about it?
[12:58.380 --> 12:59.900]  Oh, wait, Nathan Lane is in this?
[12:59.960 --> 13:00.300]  Oh, that works.
[13:00.560 --> 13:00.740]  Great.
[13:00.820 --> 13:01.620]  Oh, you fucking did it.
[13:01.920 --> 13:02.600]  Yeah, great.
[13:03.520 --> 13:04.280]  Hey, look, it's Nathan Lane.
[13:04.280 --> 13:06.880]  Would you say this is Nathan Lane in his prime?
[13:08.620 --> 13:09.780]  Birdhouse or whatever.
[13:09.920 --> 13:11.200]  Wasn't this around the same time?
[13:11.960 --> 13:12.360]  Birdcage.
[13:12.360 --> 13:12.460]  Birdcage.
[13:12.580 --> 13:14.120]  Wasn't that the same time frame as this?
[13:14.280 --> 13:14.700]  Let's see.
[13:14.940 --> 13:15.740]  I'm gonna look up Birdcage.
[13:16.040 --> 13:18.320]  I think Birdcage might have been a little before this.
[13:18.500 --> 13:19.280]  I think so, too.
[13:19.580 --> 13:20.880]  I think it's within three years.
[13:21.660 --> 13:22.060]  1972.
[13:23.000 --> 13:23.300]  Oh, no.
[13:23.960 --> 13:24.620]  That's the original.
[13:24.880 --> 13:25.000]  Yeah.
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.040]  Because it was like this and that and then Mrs. Doubtfire.
[13:32.980 --> 13:33.380]  1996.
[13:33.380 --> 13:34.320]  Was it Mrs. Doubtfire?
[13:34.640 --> 13:35.080]  Wasn't he?
[13:35.580 --> 13:35.920]  No.
[13:37.300 --> 13:38.040]  It was Mrs. Doubtfire.
[13:38.240 --> 13:38.620]  Oh, never mind.
[13:38.720 --> 13:39.200]  No, no, no, no.
[13:39.640 --> 13:40.520]  I was thinking of the brother.
[13:40.760 --> 13:41.760]  Oh, you're thinking of Robin Williams.
[13:41.900 --> 13:41.980]  Yeah.
[13:42.660 --> 13:43.040]  Oh, yeah.
[13:43.060 --> 13:43.760]  That's who I was thinking of.
[13:43.780 --> 13:45.680]  He was Mrs. Doubtfire.
[13:46.020 --> 13:46.200]  Yeah.
[13:47.320 --> 13:49.160]  I thought we're about to get some Ratatouille action.
[13:49.640 --> 13:55.220]  Dude, when you go to Nathan Lane's IMDb movies, he's known for his top four.
[13:55.740 --> 13:56.160]  The Producer.
[13:56.600 --> 13:57.480]  The Producers.
[13:58.280 --> 13:59.080]  The Birdcage.
[13:59.420 --> 13:59.620]  Okay.
[13:59.780 --> 14:00.400]  Lion King.
[14:00.860 --> 14:01.180]  Okay.
[14:02.000 --> 14:02.560]  Mouse Hunt.
[14:03.380 --> 14:03.840]  Hell yeah.
[14:04.960 --> 14:05.720]  Hell yeah.
[14:06.200 --> 14:06.780]  What a movie.
[14:10.650 --> 14:13.150]  I think more food should be served to you on fire.
[14:14.630 --> 14:15.910]  Just generally speaking.
[14:18.550 --> 14:21.510]  So, they own a string factory, but he's a chef?
[14:23.150 --> 14:25.330]  I think the family's wealthy in string.
[14:25.970 --> 14:27.370]  I think the dad had the string factory.
[14:27.770 --> 14:28.870]  But the dad died.
[14:28.970 --> 14:30.470]  He got shoved down a sewer.
[14:30.970 --> 14:31.990]  Right, so they inherited it.
[14:31.990 --> 14:34.610]  They inherited the factory and some old house.
[14:37.550 --> 14:38.570]  Uh-oh.
[14:40.810 --> 14:42.790]  Is this guy gonna choke and...
[14:42.790 --> 14:43.010]  Yeah.
[14:43.350 --> 14:43.710]  He...
[14:45.990 --> 14:47.190]  Oh no.
[14:50.030 --> 14:51.230]  CG cockroach.
[14:51.310 --> 14:52.070]  Is this in 3D?
[14:53.830 --> 14:54.270]  Whoa!
[14:56.250 --> 14:57.390]  He's gonna hurl.
[15:03.450 --> 15:04.350]  Hell yeah.
[15:04.530 --> 15:05.630]  So, just stab the table.
[15:05.710 --> 15:06.850]  Kid, just stab the table.
[15:06.850 --> 15:07.670]  We'll add it post.
[15:07.730 --> 15:08.110]  Don't worry.
[15:09.250 --> 15:10.350]  He fucking died?
[15:10.630 --> 15:12.050]  This is crazy.
[15:12.590 --> 15:14.690]  Dude, the body count on this film is already at two.
[15:15.990 --> 15:17.350]  We're going for about nine minutes.
[15:17.350 --> 15:18.810]  And they both own string factories.
[15:20.490 --> 15:21.030]  Hey, you know what?
[15:21.470 --> 15:23.210]  Kevin McAllister never put a man in the ground.
[15:24.210 --> 15:25.010]  That's a good point.
[15:25.430 --> 15:27.350]  But this guy's not Kevin McAllister.
[15:27.550 --> 15:29.870]  This guy's one of the wet bandits or whatever.
[15:32.570 --> 15:35.570]  Well, they were the wet bandits in the second?
[15:35.670 --> 15:36.150]  First one.
[15:36.190 --> 15:36.530]  The first one.
[15:36.850 --> 15:37.590]  First was wet.
[15:37.690 --> 15:38.350]  Second was sticky.
[15:38.470 --> 15:39.230]  Oh, it's that guy.
[15:40.950 --> 15:41.750]  Mark Ruffalo?
[15:42.090 --> 15:44.490]  No, the Mario something.
[15:45.050 --> 15:46.270]  Mario Puzo.
[15:47.210 --> 15:48.010]  Mario Cantone.
[15:48.570 --> 15:49.290]  I think that's his name.
[15:49.290 --> 15:50.330]  I think it's Mario Cantone.
[15:50.410 --> 15:55.250]  He was like, uh, he's in like all those I love the 80s, but then also Sex and the City.
[15:55.370 --> 15:56.470]  Yeah, yeah, that guy.
[15:56.550 --> 15:57.110]  Mario Cantone.
[15:57.670 --> 15:58.470]  Mario Luigi.
[15:59.150 --> 16:00.270]  Mario T Plumber.
[16:00.890 --> 16:03.770]  I don't understand how that's actually making a ball of string.
[16:04.130 --> 16:05.070]  Yeah, I don't.
[16:05.130 --> 16:06.370]  Just turning a ball of string.
[16:06.850 --> 16:08.090]  It looks like it is, yes.
[16:08.310 --> 16:11.310]  I have like a lot of questions.
[16:11.550 --> 16:16.070]  Like this movie is very confusing to me in like very basic ways.
[16:17.570 --> 16:19.830]  The Mafia wants to buy the string?
[16:21.010 --> 16:22.190]  The factory, I guess.
[16:22.890 --> 16:25.530]  This is back when string was very important.
[16:27.950 --> 16:29.250]  Do you think string's out these days?
[16:29.690 --> 16:30.730]  String's way out.
[16:30.770 --> 16:32.630]  Yeah, we have like Facebook and stuff now, dude.
[16:32.630 --> 16:33.650]  You don't even need string.
[16:34.090 --> 16:37.790]  Most of our bullets in WW2 were full of string.
[16:39.210 --> 16:40.950]  You'd kill people with a staph infection.
[16:41.170 --> 16:43.790]  We have threads, stupid.
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.480]  Jeff, you ever have MRSA?
[16:50.580 --> 16:50.940]  No.
[16:51.640 --> 16:52.000]  Okay.
[16:52.660 --> 16:53.420]  Why, have you?
[16:53.860 --> 16:54.480]  No, no, no.
[16:54.620 --> 16:55.180]  I was just curious.
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.680]  It just seems like it's a thing that like some people get sometimes and you just go like,
[16:59.740 --> 17:00.680]  holy shit, you had MRSA?
[17:00.760 --> 17:01.760]  It just seems like one of those things.
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.380]  Nah, I've never really been sick.
[17:03.900 --> 17:06.080]  Now that's, that's...
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.760]  Is that right?
[17:08.300 --> 17:12.260]  Yeah, I get a lot of shit-related problems, but that's pretty much it.
[17:12.320 --> 17:15.020]  But you don't consider that part of your health?
[17:15.980 --> 17:17.180]  I get butt sick.
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.860]  I don't get like other kinds of sick.
[17:18.940 --> 17:21.540]  Have you heard of a term called dental health?
[17:21.600 --> 17:21.720]  Yeah.
[17:22.320 --> 17:22.760]  Oh.
[17:23.260 --> 17:25.140]  Yeah, I guess I get mouth sick sometimes.
[17:26.320 --> 17:28.420]  But at least it's all connected, right?
[17:28.500 --> 17:30.100]  It's like the front hole and the back hole.
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.340]  It's just one long string.
[17:31.900 --> 17:36.480]  You were so mouth sick that you may have phantom mouth sickness.
[17:36.860 --> 17:38.360]  Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.
[17:38.460 --> 17:41.100]  I tried to go to an endodontist this week and it was out of networks.
[17:41.260 --> 17:42.920]  And I gotta figure out what my...
[17:42.920 --> 17:46.820]  The same endodontist I went to fucking four times over the last three years
[17:46.820 --> 17:48.420]  is now no longer in our network.
[17:48.880 --> 17:49.160]  Great.
[17:50.960 --> 17:54.680]  This actor genuinely looks like he was on the brink of death.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.080]  Maybe he just acted really good.
[17:57.100 --> 17:58.260]  This has to be his last movie.
[17:58.440 --> 18:01.060]  Do you think they filmed this at his house when he was in hospital?
[18:01.340 --> 18:02.560]  That's his actual bed.
[18:02.640 --> 18:05.420]  I don't know. It's like too real, though. I don't like it.
[18:05.540 --> 18:08.040]  If you pull up the trivia, I believe he actually was dead.
[18:08.120 --> 18:10.420]  And this was animatronic work with his body.
[18:11.320 --> 18:13.280]  He was like Tony Soprano's mom.
[18:15.180 --> 18:17.240]  That looks so bad. It's like the worst.
[18:17.820 --> 18:19.080]  A world without strange chaos.
[18:21.840 --> 18:22.720]  Oh, no.
[18:23.600 --> 18:24.080]  Did...
[18:24.080 --> 18:24.620]  Oh.
[18:24.820 --> 18:25.680]  Oh, she's in Godzilla.
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.480]  Yes. Yeah.
[18:29.500 --> 18:30.240]  Which one?
[18:30.860 --> 18:31.880]  The Broderick one.
[18:32.160 --> 18:34.620]  Yeah, the one that came out in 97. Didn't it come out in 97?
[18:35.200 --> 18:37.840]  A big Japanese monster terrorized New York.
[18:37.980 --> 18:39.200]  Not the one from 90's fire.
[18:39.420 --> 18:40.640]  It might have been 98, honestly.
[18:40.820 --> 18:41.360]  Was it really?
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.800]  Because the... I know the song was, so I assume the movie came out the same year as that.
[18:45.800 --> 18:47.620]  Come with me. Yeah, 98.
[18:50.120 --> 18:51.080]  Oh, that lady.
[18:51.780 --> 18:52.300]  Yeah, it's Beth.
[18:52.700 --> 18:52.720]  Godzilla.
[18:54.860 --> 18:56.520]  Oh, that's the news radio lady.
[18:57.420 --> 18:58.540]  Beth from news radio.
[18:58.980 --> 18:59.220]  Yeah.
[18:59.460 --> 18:59.860]  Yeah.
[19:01.120 --> 19:02.360]  You know who else is on news radio?
[19:03.600 --> 19:05.160]  Fucking whole cast of other people.
[19:05.780 --> 19:07.040]  I don't know. I don't watch that shit.
[19:07.340 --> 19:07.620]  Bill Hartman.
[19:07.740 --> 19:09.540]  You know who was on that show? Joe Rogan.
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.820]  God, I love Bill Hartman.
[19:10.820 --> 19:11.340]  Oh, that's right.
[19:12.260 --> 19:15.120]  Probably John Lovitz. I think he replaced him when Bill Hartman died or something.
[19:15.260 --> 19:16.520]  Yes, that is true.
[19:18.220 --> 19:19.980]  If only this mouse died instead of him.
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.700]  Vicky Lewis, also the voice of Deb from Finding Nemo.
[19:28.120 --> 19:28.700]  Who's Deb?
[19:29.080 --> 19:29.680]  Who's Deb?
[19:29.680 --> 19:33.800]  If you could go back in time and kill a mouse for a thousand dollars, would you?
[19:35.020 --> 19:35.660]  I don't think so.
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.640]  My uncle is so happy.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.420]  Wait, is he paying or getting paid?
[19:39.820 --> 19:41.180]  He's got to pay to kill it.
[19:41.280 --> 19:42.140]  Oh, definitely not.
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.480]  Yeah, but this was Christopher Reeve's mouse.
[19:47.060 --> 19:48.600]  Christopher Reeve's kid's mouse.
[19:49.080 --> 19:50.940]  This is the mouse that scared the horse.
[19:51.140 --> 19:51.720]  The horse, yeah.
[19:51.840 --> 19:53.640]  Yeah, that kicked Christopher Reeve off.
[19:53.920 --> 19:55.220]  I had the same thought.
[19:55.400 --> 19:59.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to consider that horses are afraid of mice like elephants.
[20:02.620 --> 20:05.520]  Do elephants ever actually shit the bed when they see a mouse?
[20:05.860 --> 20:07.100]  I don't know. I'll look it up.
[20:07.400 --> 20:08.300]  That's a good question.
[20:08.800 --> 20:11.760]  Is elephant afraid...
[20:12.480 --> 20:14.940]  We've got to test all these cartoon tropes.
[20:15.300 --> 20:15.420]  Yep.
[20:16.040 --> 20:20.260]  Oh, wait. So because of the roach, that dude lost his fancy ass restaurant?
[20:20.500 --> 20:20.740]  Yeah.
[20:20.880 --> 20:22.140]  Yeah, because all the press was there.
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.900]  Yeah, because he killed the mayor.
[20:24.240 --> 20:26.940]  He was the mayor and he ate a cockroach head and died.
[20:27.220 --> 20:29.540]  Yep. Elephants die all the time from eating.
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.240]  What?
[20:32.060 --> 20:34.560]  People die all the time from eating?
[20:35.040 --> 20:36.160]  Yeah, you ever choke, bitch?
[20:39.700 --> 20:43.240]  Elephants are not afraid of mice is the consensus here.
[20:44.700 --> 20:48.440]  Okay, I've got some cartoons that might disagree with that.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.380]  Just another lie from Big Mouse.
[20:52.660 --> 20:56.460]  Evil x-ray says I want to know if Kevin would lay on a bed of wet bread for a million dollars.
[20:57.200 --> 20:58.080]  Oh, man.
[20:58.820 --> 20:59.680]  I definitely would.
[20:59.720 --> 21:01.440]  It wouldn't be pretty, but I'd get right in there.
[21:01.740 --> 21:01.920]  Yeah.
[21:02.360 --> 21:03.100]  Wait, for how long?
[21:04.980 --> 21:06.420]  A million seconds.
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.960]  You'd lay in a tres leches bed for a million dollars?
[21:12.500 --> 21:15.140]  Yeah. For 10 minutes?
[21:15.480 --> 21:18.800]  Oh, that's $100,000 a minute.
[21:20.220 --> 21:21.260]  That's a good bunch.
[21:23.060 --> 21:24.040]  I'll throw up...
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.860]  I'll probably throw up minute four and then I'll just...
[21:26.820 --> 21:28.340]  be laughing all the way to the bank.
[21:28.740 --> 21:34.380]  What if the only caveat is you can't change clothes or take a shower until the next day?
[21:34.560 --> 21:36.960]  So you have to go about the rest of your business in the wet milk bread.
[21:37.820 --> 21:38.480]  Yeah, that's fine.
[21:39.140 --> 21:42.520]  Wow. What if you also had to go back in time and kill a mouse?
[21:43.280 --> 21:44.260]  Nah, I don't want to kill a mouse.
[21:44.640 --> 21:46.860]  But it still costs you $1,000 to do that.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.980]  But the mouse was literally Hitler.
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.780]  Go ahead and say no now, asshole. You can't do it.
[21:55.980 --> 21:56.060]  Yeah.
[21:56.060 --> 21:56.180]  Yeah.
[21:57.720 --> 21:59.420]  You ready to pony up that thousand?
[22:01.700 --> 22:03.440]  Still got $999,000 left.
[22:06.200 --> 22:07.340]  But he has string.
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.560]  Is this a Christmas movie?
[22:10.200 --> 22:10.640]  Oh.
[22:11.380 --> 22:12.260]  It's Christmas in the movie.
[22:13.620 --> 22:14.100]  Like Die Hard?
[22:15.480 --> 22:17.700]  Yeah, this is Christmas in the credits.
[22:18.460 --> 22:20.700]  I mean, the body count matches time-wise so far.
[22:22.100 --> 22:26.040]  I think more people have died in this movie than they have in Die Hard by this
[22:26.040 --> 22:26.360]  point.
[22:27.700 --> 22:28.900]  I think you're right, yeah.
[22:29.220 --> 22:32.560]  Well, I think all he's done at this point in Die Hard is pick up his luggage.
[22:32.940 --> 22:37.860]  Yeah, he like made fists with his toes and then he's riding around with argyle.
[22:38.360 --> 22:38.600]  Yeah.
[22:40.320 --> 22:41.280]  Ah, the house.
[22:43.040 --> 22:44.480]  You have fond memories of this house?
[22:46.940 --> 22:49.140]  Been a lot of your childhood daydreaming about this house?
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.920]  I bet it'd be sick to live there.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.200]  It's full of mice.
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.180]  Well, it's full of mouse.
[22:56.560 --> 22:58.000]  It's full of mouse, Jeff.
[22:59.740 --> 23:01.300]  There's a mouse in that house.
[23:05.520 --> 23:06.580]  Mouse not mouse, Jeff?
[23:06.740 --> 23:09.460]  Oh man, let's see how we survive that not that first.
[23:09.540 --> 23:11.140]  I don't, guys, I don't know.
[23:11.620 --> 23:12.520]  It's gonna be something.
[23:13.000 --> 23:14.620]  I'm already ready to argue tomorrow.
[23:14.920 --> 23:18.500]  The way some of these people are interpreting some of this stuff is crazy.
[23:18.780 --> 23:19.300]  I just don't.
[23:19.300 --> 23:20.080]  Yeah.
[23:22.900 --> 23:24.100]  Pops never told them?
[23:25.540 --> 23:28.000]  I feel like they could have started the movie right there on that line.
[23:28.360 --> 23:28.520]  Yeah.
[23:29.620 --> 23:30.380]  It's huge.
[23:32.880 --> 23:35.480]  This is where Pop used to breed super mice.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.000]  Nick, I don't think we're watching the same movie.
[23:40.640 --> 23:42.820]  Well, that's what they find out later when they're terrorized.
[23:43.080 --> 23:43.520]  Spoilers!
[23:46.100 --> 23:47.560]  What's everybody eating for dinner tonight?
[23:48.560 --> 23:49.420]  Chicken and rice.
[23:49.640 --> 23:50.500]  Yeah, probably.
[23:51.620 --> 23:52.060]  Cockroaches.
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.740]  One half of a cockroach.
[23:55.940 --> 23:58.960]  Wait, are you guys eating the same meal? Did you coordinate that?
[23:59.440 --> 23:59.720]  Yeah.
[24:01.180 --> 24:03.140]  What kind of chicken and rice are you having, Gavin?
[24:04.500 --> 24:06.280]  Just regular chicken with rice.
[24:07.100 --> 24:08.680]  How are you preparing the chicken?
[24:09.620 --> 24:10.360]  Chop it up.
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.020]  And then you'd cook it in some way?
[24:14.620 --> 24:16.160]  Oh, it's already cooked. It's like a rotisserie.
[24:16.160 --> 24:19.580]  Oh, thank you. And then Eric, what's your chicken and rice look like?
[24:20.280 --> 24:25.560]  I made like a ginger sesame teriyaki chicken earlier this week.
[24:25.720 --> 24:27.160]  And so I'm getting through the rest of it.
[24:27.620 --> 24:28.660]  What do you got going on, Nick?
[24:29.340 --> 24:31.860]  I had tortilla soup that I made.
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.740]  Oh, right. You were soup talking earlier.
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.660]  Now imagine you wake up and every day you flip a coin.
[24:51.430 --> 24:54.950]  When was the last time you slept in bed with another dude?
[24:56.810 --> 24:57.370]  Hmm.
[24:58.630 --> 24:59.710]  Let me think.
[25:01.290 --> 25:01.850]  Tuesday.
[25:05.030 --> 25:06.010]  This is tough.
[25:12.730 --> 25:14.410]  2004 would be my guess.
[25:17.170 --> 25:20.910]  Funny, mine's probably not that far off of that as well.
[25:21.950 --> 25:27.290]  It was around season two of Red vs. Blue when we realized we could afford two hotel rooms.
[25:27.890 --> 25:31.350]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, a lot of Mega64 was like,
[25:31.990 --> 25:33.090]  all right, how are we doing this?
[25:33.370 --> 25:34.710]  And hunking up, doing that.
[25:35.230 --> 25:38.130]  Gus and I used to sleep head to toe a lot back in the early days.
[25:39.450 --> 25:40.910]  What? Does that help?
[25:42.890 --> 25:47.770]  You just don't accidentally like fucking get spooned by Gus in the middle of the night,
[25:47.870 --> 25:48.730]  which happened once.
[25:49.610 --> 25:51.930]  You could still get spooned. It's just a really weird position.
[25:51.930 --> 25:54.490]  No, the worst case scenario, you just get like a kick in the face, but...
[25:54.490 --> 25:55.170]  That's way less.
[25:55.170 --> 25:58.150]  I don't know. You don't want to be nuzzled by Gus's fucking,
[25:58.190 --> 25:59.530]  fucking five o'clock shadow, dude.
[25:59.870 --> 26:00.990]  It's a weird way to wake up.
[26:01.330 --> 26:03.950]  I don't know, man. Your genitals are lined up now with your face.
[26:04.650 --> 26:05.290]  Wait, what?
[26:05.930 --> 26:07.590]  What? If they're head to toe?
[26:08.050 --> 26:09.930]  You got your balls on your ankles while you're talking?
[26:13.430 --> 26:15.090]  No wonder Nick's a foot guy.
[26:15.490 --> 26:16.210]  Yeah, no kidding.
[26:16.290 --> 26:17.350]  No, I don't like feet.
[26:17.810 --> 26:19.130]  Jesus Christ.
[26:24.070 --> 26:24.650]  Oh, lovely Evans.
[26:24.650 --> 26:25.430]  It's only a toy.
[26:26.310 --> 26:27.170]  Did he give up?
[26:29.230 --> 26:31.510]  Like, I feel like he's in a bunch of movies at this time,
[26:31.550 --> 26:33.530]  and then he just, like, stopped.
[26:34.090 --> 26:35.550]  I mean, he's not known for movies, really.
[26:36.610 --> 26:38.670]  Yeah, like, I meant, like, did...
[26:38.670 --> 26:40.550]  Was he rejected, or did he just decide,
[26:40.610 --> 26:42.470]  you know what, I don't need to be a Hollywood star.
[26:42.910 --> 26:44.410]  I think he wanted to spend more time with family,
[26:44.510 --> 26:46.230]  and then he, like, fully retired from stand-up, too.
[26:46.870 --> 26:47.750]  Really, what's he do now?
[26:48.470 --> 26:48.930]  He's retired.
[26:49.690 --> 26:50.690]  Owns a string factory.
[26:51.310 --> 26:52.330]  Supports his son, Chris.
[26:52.890 --> 26:54.250]  Just spends time with family, I guess.
[26:54.290 --> 26:55.670]  Oh, it's the mouse!
[26:56.650 --> 26:57.370]  Oh, finally!
[27:00.310 --> 27:01.930]  How long did it take to get to the mouse?
[27:02.830 --> 27:03.850]  I don't know, don't move the mouse.
[27:03.930 --> 27:05.630]  All right, well, 21 minutes.
[27:05.770 --> 27:06.390]  Nick moved the mouse.
[27:07.790 --> 27:09.550]  I moved the mouse to see when we saw the mouse.
[27:10.270 --> 27:13.110]  For some reason, people's heads going through the ceiling is always funny.
[27:13.390 --> 27:13.950]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[27:14.850 --> 27:17.370]  He had limbs going through any floor, I think is funny.
[27:17.950 --> 27:18.610]  Forward or down.
[27:18.710 --> 27:19.470]  Up or down, yeah.
[27:20.210 --> 27:20.570]  Oh.
[27:23.690 --> 27:28.130]  Oh, by the way, Andrew, I was listening to a bit of Howard Stern the other day,
[27:28.190 --> 27:32.270]  and they had a doctor on who was talking about, like, the best shitting practices.
[27:32.750 --> 27:38.030]  And he said that vertical wiping is considered the healthiest way to...
[27:38.030 --> 27:38.850]  Oh, interesting.
[27:39.090 --> 27:39.670]  ...to eliminate.
[27:39.770 --> 27:40.770]  So you're ahead of the game.
[27:40.890 --> 27:41.590]  Just wanted to throw that out there.
[27:41.690 --> 27:42.070]  Hell yeah.
[27:49.050 --> 27:51.050]  This movie suddenly got really good.
[27:51.450 --> 27:52.150]  That guy!
[27:53.110 --> 27:54.290]  Well, yeah, that guy.
[27:55.870 --> 27:59.630]  You know, he looks the same today as he does 30 years ago.
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.370]  Oh, they're locked in there with him.
[28:04.590 --> 28:04.810]  Uh-oh.
[28:04.990 --> 28:05.730]  Cool shot, bro.
[28:10.640 --> 28:11.520]  Yeah, the...
[28:11.520 --> 28:15.220]  Gore Verbinski being chosen to make this is such an interesting choice.
[28:16.800 --> 28:18.620]  Oh my god, is that the dude who...
[28:18.620 --> 28:18.700]  That's crazy.
[28:19.860 --> 28:21.880]  ...is Elmo's buddy on Sesame Street?
[28:21.880 --> 28:24.860]  Man, he gets killed in Jurassic Park 3.
[28:25.740 --> 28:26.580]  The raptor.
[28:28.560 --> 28:30.620]  I don't remember Jurassic Park 3 at all.
[28:30.880 --> 28:31.440]  I don't think I've seen that one.
[28:31.440 --> 28:32.300]  They use him as a bait.
[28:32.440 --> 28:32.620]  It was good.
[28:32.840 --> 28:34.260]  They're like, oh, we gotta help Mr. Whatever.
[28:34.500 --> 28:36.440]  And then the raptor puts a claw in his back.
[28:36.520 --> 28:37.060]  He's like, ah!
[28:37.660 --> 28:38.720]  You don't remember the dream?
[28:38.980 --> 28:39.320]  Alan!
[28:40.760 --> 28:41.180]  Yeah.
[28:41.660 --> 28:41.980]  No.
[28:42.520 --> 28:43.540]  The raptor talks.
[28:43.540 --> 28:44.960]  The raptor talks to him in the dream.
[28:45.300 --> 28:46.760]  Oh my god, that's awesome.
[28:46.760 --> 28:47.400]  Come on.
[28:50.100 --> 28:50.380]  Yep.
[28:50.580 --> 28:50.840]  600k.
[28:52.120 --> 28:53.980]  I wonder how many of these people are dead now.
[28:54.540 --> 28:55.140]  Vincent D'Onofrio?
[28:56.000 --> 28:56.500]  He's alive.
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.040]  Oh, who's...
[29:01.040 --> 29:01.840]  Oh, this guy.
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.380]  Oh, he played Weinstein in Entourage.
[29:04.500 --> 29:05.280]  That's how I know this guy.
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.260]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:06.340 --> 29:06.560]  Yep.
[29:15.100 --> 29:16.600]  I want a mustache like that.
[29:16.980 --> 29:19.440]  I want the ugliest fake mustache.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.580]  It's like the old way.
[29:22.680 --> 29:25.060]  It's like the Walt Disney style of mustache.
[29:25.060 --> 29:27.500]  So low, like on the lip.
[29:27.700 --> 29:27.920]  Yes.
[29:32.790 --> 29:35.850]  I feel like I was watching something the other day and somebody had a mustache like that.
[29:35.930 --> 29:37.670]  And it was just like, it looks so bizarre.
[29:40.170 --> 29:42.970]  They put a shitload into costuming.
[29:45.090 --> 29:45.890]  Set design.
[29:46.730 --> 29:47.310]  But here's the thing.
[29:47.390 --> 29:49.070]  This is just how movies used to look.
[29:49.270 --> 29:52.110]  This isn't like, wow, what a home run.
[29:52.250 --> 29:54.170]  This is just, movies don't look like this anymore.
[29:54.510 --> 29:56.510]  Like, they stopped putting effort into this.
[29:56.670 --> 29:57.110]  Yeah, I agree.
[29:57.110 --> 29:59.670]  Yeah, it's all screens and shit now.
[30:00.750 --> 30:01.490]  It is.
[30:01.650 --> 30:03.150]  It's all screens.
[30:04.410 --> 30:05.170]  You know what I mean.
[30:05.930 --> 30:07.070]  They're not even wearing clothes.
[30:07.310 --> 30:08.990]  The clothes, they're just wearing balls.
[30:09.230 --> 30:11.610]  And they superimpose the AI to clothes on.
[30:12.750 --> 30:14.070]  Those are part of the screens.
[30:15.230 --> 30:16.930]  I was thinking the same point.
[30:17.010 --> 30:19.710]  But then it's like, that is sort of what Marvel superhero movies are now.
[30:19.850 --> 30:22.170]  Like a portion, a large percentage of those suits.
[30:22.590 --> 30:22.910]  Oh, yeah.
[30:23.670 --> 30:24.070]  Yeah.
[30:25.190 --> 30:26.690]  How much did he offer them just then?
[30:28.290 --> 30:29.910]  I have his wrapped up.
[30:29.990 --> 30:31.350]  About like a million dollars.
[30:31.570 --> 30:32.850]  I was thinking about screens.
[30:37.890 --> 30:38.790]  He's very funny.
[30:50.710 --> 30:51.430]  Thank you.
[30:51.890 --> 30:54.690]  So you just have to keep the house for a week and then...
[30:58.290 --> 30:59.890]  Boy, those two do not look like brothers.
[31:01.650 --> 31:02.170]  Yeah, right.
[31:02.610 --> 31:03.450]  Nathan Lane and Lee Evans.
[31:04.010 --> 31:04.210]  Yeah.
[31:05.970 --> 31:07.670]  Maybe their mom has a dirty secret.
[31:08.890 --> 31:09.250]  Oh.
[31:21.620 --> 31:22.540]  I think they're in the money.
[31:22.540 --> 31:23.060]  Now let's do it again.
[31:23.260 --> 31:23.620]  Take two.
[31:24.040 --> 31:24.340]  Take two.
[31:24.400 --> 31:25.420]  I was going to say, how many takes was that?
[31:32.790 --> 31:33.510]  What a catch.
[31:33.950 --> 31:34.950]  How many takes that was.
[31:40.420 --> 31:41.680]  Oh, the rat is pissed.
[31:41.700 --> 31:42.660]  Oh, the rat.
[31:42.820 --> 31:43.320]  Rat cam.
[31:43.580 --> 31:44.100]  Rat cam.
[31:46.500 --> 31:47.620]  It's like the end of Godzilla.
[31:50.080 --> 31:50.760]  One egg.
[31:58.360 --> 32:02.020]  This is me trying to find the last collectible in a level of Ratatouille.
[32:02.300 --> 32:03.460]  No kidding.
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.860]  Oh, what are those mouse holes?
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.340]  Do you think it's allowed to use another mouse's mouse hole,
[32:17.420 --> 32:18.800]  or do you have to make your own hole?
[32:21.380 --> 32:23.440]  Well, it depends if what comes to the house and what doesn't.
[32:24.640 --> 32:25.140]  The olive.
[32:25.280 --> 32:26.200]  The olive from the cover.
[32:26.760 --> 32:27.440]  He rolled it back.
[32:27.720 --> 32:28.100]  Yeah.
[32:29.020 --> 32:30.460]  This mouse is fucking pale.
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.680]  Dude, I love, I love olives.
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.680]  Yeah, they're the best.
[32:39.820 --> 32:41.160]  They're so good.
[32:42.440 --> 32:43.260]  Right there with you, buddy.
[32:43.640 --> 32:47.160]  I like that other people like olives.
[32:47.740 --> 32:49.340]  They're so brined and tasty.
[32:50.700 --> 32:52.220]  Nice can of olives.
[32:53.340 --> 32:54.000]  Yes, please.
[32:54.340 --> 32:55.060]  I like how they look.
[32:55.180 --> 32:57.860]  I like the sound of the crunch of them.
[32:58.420 --> 32:59.540]  But I don't want one.
[33:00.460 --> 33:01.500]  Garlic stuff, jalapeno stuff.
[33:01.660 --> 33:01.980]  Do they crunch?
[33:02.360 --> 33:03.000]  Blue cheese.
[33:03.040 --> 33:03.440]  They can.
[33:05.800 --> 33:08.720]  They're definitely like, they definitely have some heft to them, you know?
[33:09.660 --> 33:11.820]  They're meaty for a vegetable.
[33:12.420 --> 33:15.160]  Boy, and a, and a martini one.
[33:15.900 --> 33:19.120]  Yeah, those were, those were the days.
[33:22.510 --> 33:23.230]  Sorry, chef.
[33:23.490 --> 33:23.710]  I'm hot.
[33:25.650 --> 33:27.110]  I can still put them on my fingers.
[33:28.210 --> 33:29.250]  I still have that.
[33:31.110 --> 33:32.270]  We'll always have our fingers.
[33:33.230 --> 33:33.570]  Well.
[33:36.250 --> 33:37.410]  Green olives over black olives?
[33:37.510 --> 33:37.870]  I guess.
[33:37.950 --> 33:40.190]  I think they're both, they both have their place.
[33:42.630 --> 33:45.270]  I'd rather have a Kalamata olive than a black olive, I think.
[33:45.930 --> 33:46.270]  Interesting.
[33:53.920 --> 33:56.040]  This, we should get a house like this as our office.
[33:58.960 --> 34:00.380]  It has to have the mouse.
[34:01.300 --> 34:03.680]  I guarantee if we get a house like this, it's going to have the mouse.
[34:12.280 --> 34:13.540]  Yeah, he's mocking you.
[34:25.720 --> 34:27.100]  Please cut to that happening.
[34:27.280 --> 34:28.300]  Please cut to that happening.
[34:28.540 --> 34:28.980]  I want to see.
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.240]  Definitely a lost opportunity.
[34:36.830 --> 34:38.190]  There he is eating Cheerios!
[34:39.430 --> 34:39.750]  Yeah!
[34:42.810 --> 34:47.910]  Oh, this is Home Alone 3.
[34:52.170 --> 34:53.170]  You don't let him get away.
[34:53.250 --> 34:54.530]  Hit him with the soft end of the broom.
[34:55.810 --> 34:56.370]  Well.
[34:56.790 --> 34:58.830]  I mean, you know, wider area.
[34:59.190 --> 34:59.690]  Yeah.
[35:00.670 --> 35:01.910]  You could like hockey puck him.
[35:01.970 --> 35:03.670]  Might be some shock damage to him.
[35:08.870 --> 35:10.330]  Are we thinking hammer to the feet?
[35:10.490 --> 35:11.450]  This is great.
[35:11.710 --> 35:15.050]  This is the physical comedy and this is very funny.
[35:15.630 --> 35:16.230]  The bowl hit him.
[35:16.750 --> 35:17.310]  Oh!
[35:17.950 --> 35:23.450]  Oh, the sound on the broom is good.
[35:24.170 --> 35:26.170]  This is, this is very funny.
[35:30.650 --> 35:32.670]  Did you guys ever see that movie A Tale of Two Sisters?
[35:33.270 --> 35:34.190]  Korean horror film?
[35:34.770 --> 35:36.310]  No, no, I would never.
[35:36.490 --> 35:39.290]  I'll never get on the ground and look in a fucking hole like that again.
[35:39.590 --> 35:40.490]  Oh, what?
[35:42.050 --> 35:42.790]  What was in the hole?
[35:43.470 --> 35:44.570]  Fucking evil girl.
[35:45.230 --> 35:46.430]  Oh, I'm out.
[35:47.310 --> 35:47.990]  Hell yeah!
[35:52.070 --> 35:55.050]  Dude, he's like an extreme sports mouse.
[35:56.910 --> 35:57.710]  That's a huge training wheel.
[35:57.710 --> 35:58.630]  He's training for the race.
[36:00.050 --> 36:01.590]  What kind of cheese is that, do you think?
[36:02.590 --> 36:03.070]  Edam?
[36:04.470 --> 36:05.550]  How long does a mouse live?
[36:07.230 --> 36:10.450]  How long does a mouse live?
[36:10.490 --> 36:11.950]  I'd guess three years.
[36:13.150 --> 36:15.010]  Yeah, probably three to five, right?
[36:15.510 --> 36:18.030]  Mice usually live about 12 to 18 months.
[36:18.450 --> 36:19.550]  Oh, wow.
[36:19.630 --> 36:21.590]  So there's no way this mouse is still around.
[36:21.970 --> 36:22.610]  That's a bad bet.
[36:24.850 --> 36:26.690]  They probably went through a few during filming.
[36:27.170 --> 36:27.570]  Yeah.
[36:28.550 --> 36:32.990]  And then other places are saying in other captivity for like pet mice,
[36:33.210 --> 36:34.350]  one and a half to three years.
[36:34.550 --> 36:35.670]  He ate that whole wheel.
[36:35.670 --> 36:36.910]  He ate the whole thing?
[36:38.250 --> 36:39.650]  That mouse is good as shit.
[36:39.810 --> 36:41.410]  He's definitely not making it to three years.
[36:41.410 --> 36:41.590]  Or not.
[36:42.050 --> 36:42.870]  He may never shit again.
[36:45.950 --> 36:49.830]  I wonder if mice could visit mice doctors if they could extend their lifespan.
[36:50.910 --> 36:51.790]  Yeah, that's the real question.
[36:51.790 --> 36:54.270]  You could go check the mouse cardiologist and see, you know...
[36:55.330 --> 36:57.070]  God, how do they film all these shots?
[36:57.170 --> 36:58.390]  This must have been a bollock.
[36:59.910 --> 37:00.750]  It's all CGI.
[37:02.370 --> 37:03.570]  Oh, I love that.
[37:03.870 --> 37:04.290]  That's cute.
[37:05.410 --> 37:06.950]  Of course, he loves the foot shot.
[37:08.450 --> 37:10.010]  I don't like that.
[37:10.170 --> 37:12.350]  I hate when he moans when you talk about feet.
[37:12.590 --> 37:13.370]  He can't stop himself.
[37:13.450 --> 37:14.230]  Yeah, he can't stop.
[37:14.770 --> 37:17.030]  Oh, he's got a little cute little bed.
[37:17.830 --> 37:19.990]  Oh, man.
[37:21.110 --> 37:21.950]  That's so sweet.
[37:22.130 --> 37:22.810]  It's adorable.
[37:24.270 --> 37:26.210]  That's the cutest shit I've ever seen.
[37:29.500 --> 37:30.920]  Well, his mouse's house.
[37:31.160 --> 37:31.680]  Goddamn.
[37:32.220 --> 37:33.160]  Oh, here he goes.
[37:33.500 --> 37:34.740]  Go to sleep, little bunnies.
[37:34.840 --> 37:37.800]  He's gonna have some gnarly cheese dreams.
[37:37.800 --> 37:38.480]  Dreaming about Hawaii.
[37:39.320 --> 37:40.780]  I long to be in Hawaii.
[37:41.980 --> 37:42.500]  No!
[37:43.440 --> 37:43.960]  No!
[37:45.980 --> 37:46.500]  No!
[37:47.900 --> 37:48.580]  Jesus Christ.
[37:48.580 --> 37:49.860]  The little mouse in the...
[37:49.860 --> 37:51.000]  Oh my God!
[37:52.800 --> 37:54.800]  I wonder how many mice they killed making this movie.
[37:55.720 --> 37:56.600]  Holy shit.
[38:00.320 --> 38:01.820]  What the hell are they doing?
[38:01.840 --> 38:02.640]  That looks so cool.
[38:02.920 --> 38:04.360]  Fuck are they doing?
[38:04.380 --> 38:04.980]  Oh, I see.
[38:05.220 --> 38:06.760]  He's just putting on some new skirting.
[38:06.960 --> 38:08.560]  I don't think you need that many nails, but...
[38:08.560 --> 38:09.680]  No, absolutely not.
[38:11.520 --> 38:13.880]  This is a revenge film and they don't even know it.
[38:15.100 --> 38:15.540]  Whoa!
[38:16.140 --> 38:19.020]  Okay, that was some...
[38:19.020 --> 38:19.780]  Whoa, the CG.
[38:26.550 --> 38:27.870]  Get out of there!
[38:28.170 --> 38:28.950]  Run away, mouse!
[38:32.450 --> 38:35.270]  Is there a movie auction thing where we can buy the mouse?
[38:36.550 --> 38:37.730]  We gotta save him.
[38:38.030 --> 38:38.950]  Maybe one of those nails.
[38:41.670 --> 38:44.390]  Also, you ever seen a nail gun release steam?
[38:45.410 --> 38:45.710]  No.
[38:47.450 --> 38:47.930]  Well...
[38:48.470 --> 38:49.310]  This isn't a...
[38:49.890 --> 38:51.970]  This isn't set in present day, I don't think.
[38:52.670 --> 38:53.790]  Is it not?
[38:54.710 --> 38:55.110]  I...
[38:56.970 --> 38:58.430]  I mean, did you see the cars?
[38:59.350 --> 39:01.730]  Also, everybody wears a tie all the time.
[39:01.850 --> 39:02.650]  Yeah, you know what?
[39:03.070 --> 39:03.490]  Okay.
[39:04.090 --> 39:05.790]  When do you think it's set?
[39:06.810 --> 39:08.230]  I don't know, 50s or something?
[39:09.510 --> 39:10.410]  Oh, really?
[39:10.830 --> 39:11.510]  I was guessing.
[39:11.830 --> 39:13.490]  I don't know, it's just an old ass car.
[39:13.890 --> 39:15.150]  When does Mouse Hunt...
[39:15.150 --> 39:19.130]  Back before we outsourced all our string factory jobs to China.
[39:19.590 --> 39:21.130]  Oh, string was a big deal.
[39:22.490 --> 39:26.410]  Styles range humorously from the 1940s to the 1990s
[39:26.410 --> 39:27.050]  in Mouse Hunt.
[39:29.710 --> 39:30.570]  It's timeless.
[39:30.890 --> 39:33.570]  It is just set in the late 20th century, is all it says.
[39:34.050 --> 39:34.370]  Okay.
[39:40.040 --> 39:41.280]  Oh, I bet it was fun as shit.
[39:44.700 --> 39:45.420]  Do you think that's them?
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.600]  Is this what the Nanaimo bathtub races are like?
[39:48.900 --> 39:50.940]  It's essentially this, yeah.
[39:51.140 --> 39:51.800]  That's great.
[39:52.340 --> 39:53.020]  When is that again?
[39:54.040 --> 39:55.000]  In July.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.540]  We'll see you there.
[39:56.920 --> 39:57.720]  This July.
[40:05.620 --> 40:07.660]  You're fucking dead.
[40:08.460 --> 40:11.160]  Okay, now it's truly like the Nanaimo bathtub race.
[40:24.730 --> 40:25.890]  Like you did earlier.
[40:32.300 --> 40:33.740]  I saw that on Jackass.
[41:02.460 --> 41:04.280]  Oh my god.
[41:04.980 --> 41:06.940]  You did a slow-mo guys like this with Dan once.
[41:07.660 --> 41:08.260]  Yeah.
[41:16.600 --> 41:18.280]  Yeah, I've set a lot of mouse traps.
[41:20.140 --> 41:23.200]  Have you ever, uh, has one ever gone off in your hand and got you?
[41:23.840 --> 41:24.340]  Yep.
[41:25.080 --> 41:25.900]  Oh, damn.
[41:26.640 --> 41:28.140]  Can you live to tell the tale?
[41:28.600 --> 41:29.100]  25.
[41:30.740 --> 41:37.100]  The thing I always remember about the kind of trap thing is, uh, in The Shield on FX.
[41:37.420 --> 41:37.560]  Yeah.
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.120]  There was an episode where someone was putting rat traps in glory holes.
[41:47.900 --> 41:49.580]  It's just an episode around it.
[41:49.720 --> 41:54.300]  And it's like, uh, I hope they catch the person who's doing that.
[41:57.200 --> 41:58.840]  Don't know if it ever got resolved, though.
[41:59.500 --> 41:59.960]  Can't remember.
[42:00.120 --> 42:00.720]  Sure, sure.
[42:00.960 --> 42:01.140]  Yeah.
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.920]  But Nick did stop setting the traps.
[42:04.980 --> 42:05.680]  I was gonna say.
[42:08.240 --> 42:10.520]  So in this situation, they're now Danger Aaron.
[42:11.100 --> 42:11.580]  Yeah.
[42:11.700 --> 42:12.360]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[42:17.820 --> 42:19.400]  I watched you guys play this level.
[42:21.360 --> 42:22.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:22.160 --> 42:25.500]  But we have to go back down to go up because we forgot where the other thing.
[42:25.700 --> 42:26.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:26.320 --> 42:26.920]  No, I remember this.
[42:28.080 --> 42:28.900]  That's a great stunt.
[42:33.420 --> 42:36.400]  Do you think there was an actor rat and a stunt rat?
[42:37.060 --> 42:37.920]  Yeah, there's definitely.
[42:38.440 --> 42:40.540]  Yeah, there's a stunt rat for sure.
[42:41.540 --> 42:44.020]  I'm pretty sure this rat actually does all of his own stunts.
[42:44.140 --> 42:46.160]  He's like the Tom Cruise of...
[42:46.160 --> 42:46.960]  Except for that rope swing.
[42:47.040 --> 42:47.480]  That was bullshit.
[42:47.900 --> 42:48.140]  Yeah.
[42:49.180 --> 42:50.140]  On top of the can.
[42:53.200 --> 42:54.740]  Oh, this is great.
[42:55.560 --> 42:56.480]  Brick oven.
[42:57.260 --> 43:02.200]  Why is there a thing of cherries set out like that on top of the fridge?
[43:02.360 --> 43:02.960]  You mean a bowl?
[43:03.600 --> 43:05.380]  On top of the fridge full of cherries?
[43:06.320 --> 43:06.560]  Yeah.
[43:07.520 --> 43:08.340]  This is great.
[43:08.800 --> 43:10.360]  This is very funny.
[43:13.700 --> 43:14.900]  Oh, it's beam blading.
[43:18.580 --> 43:19.040]  Ding!
[43:27.000 --> 43:27.860]  Now, why?
[43:28.040 --> 43:29.620]  Why would you roll into it?
[43:31.020 --> 43:35.160]  You know, this is the single longest day of some PA's life.
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.220]  He or she still has fucking nightmares about it.
[43:39.960 --> 43:40.720]  All right, reset.
[43:41.180 --> 43:42.280]  It's on his face.
[43:42.620 --> 43:43.400]  We're all gonna go to lunch.
[43:43.500 --> 43:44.040]  Go ahead and reset.
[43:44.420 --> 43:45.660]  Yeah, everybody else has lunch.
[43:45.800 --> 43:46.080]  That was good.
[43:46.160 --> 43:46.680]  One more time.
[43:47.000 --> 43:47.860]  We just get one more.
[43:50.360 --> 43:51.540]  Could you go ahead and set this up faster?
[43:51.600 --> 43:52.220]  We're losing light.
[43:52.220 --> 43:53.780]  He got the cheese and he got the olives.
[43:55.300 --> 43:56.120]  And some crackers.
[43:56.600 --> 43:56.880]  Wow.
[43:59.460 --> 44:02.760]  If he gets struck by lightning while he's trying to eat them, it'll be ratatouille.
[44:03.660 --> 44:06.180]  What do you think is an actor when you have to come out of a closet
[44:06.180 --> 44:08.160]  covered in mousetraps and yell juice?
[44:08.940 --> 44:09.980]  He went under that ladder.
[44:10.760 --> 44:11.260]  That's not good.
[44:14.910 --> 44:15.310]  Uh-oh.
[44:16.550 --> 44:17.270]  Hold on!
[44:17.970 --> 44:19.350]  This is like the end of Twister.
[44:21.370 --> 44:22.130]  Wrap your belt!
[44:22.250 --> 44:22.870]  Wrap your belt!
[44:25.570 --> 44:26.530]  Uh-oh.
[44:26.550 --> 44:27.530]  Oh, no!
[44:29.610 --> 44:32.530]  He should have raised his eyebrows a couple of times like Bugs Bunny.
[44:32.930 --> 44:34.690]  Did the mouse break the fourth wall?
[44:35.250 --> 44:35.870]  He sure did.
[44:36.570 --> 44:37.050]  Uh-oh.
[44:41.410 --> 44:43.550]  Two dead bodies and a load of shit.
[44:45.730 --> 44:46.770]  Oh, he said goddamn!
[44:57.160 --> 45:00.240]  Oh, dude, that's gonna be bad.
[45:00.320 --> 45:02.500]  What do they think they're sucking at this point?
[45:08.400 --> 45:10.360]  It looks like a giant pumpkin.
[45:11.940 --> 45:13.440]  Oh, my god.
[45:50.720 --> 45:53.080]  This also looks like a jackass stunt.
[45:53.700 --> 45:54.000]  Yep.
[45:56.840 --> 46:01.280]  There's a real good chance none of us will ever be covered in that much feces at once.
[46:01.400 --> 46:02.020]  I hope!
[46:02.220 --> 46:03.160]  In our entire lives.
[46:03.200 --> 46:04.100]  Fingers crossed.
[46:04.800 --> 46:05.060]  Yeah.
[46:05.640 --> 46:08.120]  It looks like there's oats in it.
[46:09.040 --> 46:10.380]  Oh, yeah, I've been eating a lot of oats.
[46:11.280 --> 46:12.820]  Yeah, you assume it's all human feces.
[46:12.980 --> 46:14.560]  Yeah, a lot of horse stuff, you know?
[46:15.300 --> 46:15.580]  Nay.
[46:26.380 --> 46:27.540]  Taking it away from her family.
[46:27.900 --> 46:28.680]  Oh, my god.
[46:28.920 --> 46:30.040]  Oh, my god!
[46:34.800 --> 46:35.200]  Jesus.
[46:36.440 --> 46:37.120]  Phew.
[46:38.340 --> 46:39.520]  Cool pound, though.
[46:39.900 --> 46:41.140]  That's a great pound.
[46:41.660 --> 46:43.820]  Looks like one of the rooms in Severance.
[46:58.750 --> 46:59.770]  Good lord.
[46:59.910 --> 47:00.370]  Jesus!
[47:01.410 --> 47:02.470]  What in the hell?
[47:02.670 --> 47:03.630]  Is that the incinerator?
[47:04.290 --> 47:04.970]  God.
[47:06.910 --> 47:08.030]  Oh, the... oh!
[47:09.050 --> 47:10.230]  The guest, the cat.
[47:13.960 --> 47:15.000]  Oh, that guy.
[47:16.760 --> 47:17.140]  Maury?
[47:17.340 --> 47:17.660]  Maury.
[47:23.830 --> 47:26.510]  The cat is not the father.
[47:29.740 --> 47:31.480]  Has Povich done any movies?
[47:32.840 --> 47:33.940]  He must have.
[47:35.300 --> 47:37.920]  Not as, like, a lead, but I think as, like, himself.
[47:38.180 --> 47:39.440]  Definitely not as a lead.
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.120]  He has...
[47:55.460 --> 47:57.180]  ...played Maury Povich a lot.
[47:57.660 --> 47:57.900]  Yeah.
[47:57.900 --> 47:58.260]  Yeah.
[48:01.360 --> 48:04.580]  They want a mentally ill, mean pussy.
[48:04.920 --> 48:08.580]  An old, mean, crazy cat.
[48:09.260 --> 48:10.400]  One that you can't love.
[48:10.980 --> 48:12.340]  It's chained in a box.
[48:12.680 --> 48:14.240]  And they're gonna... Catzilla!
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.200]  Ba-da-dun, da-na-na, ba-na-na.
[48:21.800 --> 48:22.480]  Uh-oh.
[48:23.140 --> 48:23.580]  And they're gonna...
[48:23.580 --> 48:26.380]  So they're looking into it, and as far as props being sold for this movie,
[48:26.380 --> 48:30.480]  the only prop that has been sold is the animatronic head of this cat.
[48:30.820 --> 48:31.740]  Oh my god, really?
[48:32.980 --> 48:34.300]  How much did it sell for?
[48:35.620 --> 48:38.320]  It didn't say, but it was projected between $600 to $800.
[48:38.960 --> 48:39.720]  Oh, wow.
[48:39.740 --> 48:40.820]  That seems doable.
[48:42.180 --> 48:43.860]  Depending on what this cat looks like.
[48:44.220 --> 48:45.080]  I wanna buy the mouse.
[48:46.040 --> 48:46.540]  Did he just...
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.120]  ...cowl-propped a cat?
[48:48.360 --> 48:48.740]  Yeah!
[48:49.160 --> 48:49.800]  That's Catzilla.
[48:49.920 --> 48:51.260]  How else are you gonna stop Catzilla?
[48:56.660 --> 48:57.620]  Oh god.
[48:59.580 --> 49:02.460]  I really like that they're delaying showing what this cat looks like.
[49:02.520 --> 49:03.660]  I like that they're building this.
[49:04.600 --> 49:06.200]  Gavin, is this how you picked up Smee?
[49:08.320 --> 49:08.760]  Yes.
[49:15.530 --> 49:15.970]  Yeah!
[49:18.010 --> 49:19.170]  Oh my god.
[49:20.030 --> 49:20.350]  Wow.
[49:36.540 --> 49:39.620]  These guys are gonna end up with a gorilla real soon this way.
[49:39.820 --> 49:40.840]  Yeah.
[49:40.840 --> 49:42.860]  That's how this works, man.
[49:44.080 --> 49:46.160]  Somebody has to stop this insane cat.
[49:46.840 --> 49:47.260]  Whoa.
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.300]  This little mouse.
[49:53.420 --> 49:54.940]  Go through the mouse holes.
[49:55.180 --> 49:55.560]  Oh.
[49:57.520 --> 49:59.720]  It's like Metal Gear Solid in the box.
[50:00.380 --> 50:02.000]  It works, it works.
[50:05.460 --> 50:06.220]  Whoa!
[50:08.520 --> 50:09.500]  800 bucks!
[50:10.940 --> 50:11.860]  Jesus Christ.
[50:14.240 --> 50:15.910]  That definitely seems worth it.
[50:24.100 --> 50:25.020]  Beautiful music.
[50:25.700 --> 50:27.800]  Wait, but the mouse didn't make any of them go down.
[50:28.900 --> 50:29.280]  Uh-oh.
[50:31.160 --> 50:31.620]  Yeah!
[50:32.620 --> 50:34.120]  This is a straight-up a cartoon, isn't it?
[50:34.740 --> 50:35.200]  Great.
[50:36.920 --> 50:39.100]  Sort of a Tom and Jerry thing they got going on.
[50:46.070 --> 50:46.910]  1990s car.
[50:57.620 --> 50:58.160]  What? What?
[51:12.970 --> 51:14.550]  Why would you do that?
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.600]  They're gonna hang him with his string.
[51:24.120 --> 51:28.560]  I bet he's not even gonna give him free string to offset the disappointment.
[51:29.300 --> 51:33.480]  Oh, Jay says, including the buyer's premium, the cat head was sold for $3,700.
[51:34.200 --> 51:34.520]  Wow.
[51:35.580 --> 51:36.060]  Wow.
[51:37.520 --> 51:38.680]  Too rich for my blood.
[51:39.460 --> 51:40.720]  Yeah, that's pretty rich.
[51:42.840 --> 51:45.540]  If I could have one whole mouse for that price, I'd do it.
[51:53.430 --> 51:55.670]  So this mouse is dead, right? In real life?
[51:56.290 --> 51:56.870]  Oh, yeah, big time.
[51:57.270 --> 52:01.210]  And it was an actor mouse, it was a performer mouse.
[52:01.450 --> 52:02.830]  It's an actor mouse, uh-huh.
[52:03.050 --> 52:08.490]  So it lived a life of mouse privilege and was elevated, probably.
[52:08.970 --> 52:15.930]  Do you think the people that have the mice and the horses and the dogs that are actor
[52:15.930 --> 52:20.110]  mice, horses, and dogs, do you think that they ever have them stuffed to remember them?
[52:20.350 --> 52:24.850]  Like, if you went to some lady's house, is that mouse on her kitchen table?
[52:25.850 --> 52:27.310]  Like, next to the salt and the pepper.
[52:27.830 --> 52:31.510]  It's probably, like, I bet she puts it...
[52:31.510 --> 52:34.230]  I was gonna say, I bet she puts it on top of her fridge with a bowl of cherries
[52:34.230 --> 52:35.530]  to remember it fondly.
[52:35.750 --> 52:36.590]  That would make sense.
[52:48.660 --> 52:51.180]  Yeah, a thousand percent Air Buds trainer had him stuffed.
[52:51.340 --> 52:52.040]  I agree him more.
[52:52.160 --> 52:52.280]  Yeah.
[52:52.500 --> 52:53.040]  Oh, yeah.
[52:54.900 --> 52:57.980]  Maybe the dogs from, uh, uh, Homeward Bound.
[52:59.020 --> 52:59.620]  Oh, jeez.
[53:04.180 --> 53:05.160]  Chance and Shadow.
[53:10.220 --> 53:11.540]  What was the cat code?
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.280]  Catzilla.
[53:16.880 --> 53:19.520]  Hang on, I want to see if we can remember it.
[53:20.400 --> 53:21.240]  Yes, this is...
[53:21.240 --> 53:21.920]  Poor fucking cat.
[53:22.540 --> 53:23.620]  Was that a real cat?
[53:23.780 --> 53:24.940]  It has to be.
[53:25.220 --> 53:25.620]  Oh, my God.
[53:28.420 --> 53:30.120]  What was that cat's name?
[53:30.260 --> 53:34.320]  It was, like, Sissy Spacey something.
[53:34.680 --> 53:34.880]  Sally Field.
[53:35.200 --> 53:36.680]  Slappy Samsonite.
[53:38.240 --> 53:38.760]  Samsonite.
[53:42.990 --> 53:44.330]  Do you guys remember the movie Cat's Eye?
[53:44.770 --> 53:45.670]  That was a pretty cool cat.
[53:46.830 --> 53:47.190]  No.
[53:49.450 --> 53:49.970]  Sassy.
[53:50.510 --> 53:51.030]  Sassy.
[53:51.110 --> 53:51.610]  That was close.
[53:52.610 --> 53:54.070]  Oh, you like Cat's Eye, Andrew.
[53:54.070 --> 53:57.790]  It was a horror compilation film by Stephen King.
[53:57.790 --> 53:58.330]  Oh, wow, shit.
[53:58.330 --> 54:01.050]  With, like, three stories that kind of intertwined all around a cat.
[54:01.630 --> 54:02.290]  Oh, that's awesome.
[54:02.570 --> 54:02.790]  Yeah.
[54:03.150 --> 54:05.130]  James Woods in it.
[54:06.910 --> 54:08.230]  Oh, it meowed. It might still be there.
[54:10.210 --> 54:11.030]  What the...
[54:11.030 --> 54:11.930]  Hell, yeah.
[54:12.570 --> 54:13.010]  Uh-oh.
[54:13.490 --> 54:13.950]  Uh-oh.
[54:16.310 --> 54:17.670]  Mouse just killed the cat.
[54:20.550 --> 54:22.210]  The bloodlust knows no bounds.
[54:24.570 --> 54:26.490]  This was the inspiration for Men in Black.
[54:27.510 --> 54:28.590]  Dude, no kidding.
[54:36.460 --> 54:37.400]  Oh, yes.
[54:37.840 --> 54:40.820]  It seemed like it was a big reveal, like, the way it was shot.
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.080]  And then it just didn't continue that way.
[55:15.620 --> 55:17.040]  That sounds good.
[55:20.020 --> 55:21.020]  I'm laughing.
[55:21.020 --> 55:23.140]  There are funny moments to this.
[55:31.800 --> 55:33.720]  He's gonna trick the mouse.
[55:45.850 --> 55:49.830]  How many times throughout his career before he became Christopher Walken,
[55:49.890 --> 55:53.870]  Christopher Walken, do you think he delivered a line and the director goes, uh...
[55:55.890 --> 55:57.750]  Could we try delivering it this way?
[55:57.970 --> 56:00.670]  And Walken's like, I think we'll deliver it my way.
[56:01.930 --> 56:03.750]  He just goes, what do you mean?
[56:04.490 --> 56:05.010]  No.
[56:05.010 --> 56:06.170]  That's how I said it.
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.800]  This is so crazy.
[56:37.440 --> 56:42.560]  I feel like all of these type of, like, movies that have an exterminator need this exterminator.
[56:42.940 --> 56:43.180]  Yeah.
[56:43.320 --> 56:43.560]  Yeah.
[56:43.740 --> 56:46.540]  I can't tell if I'm watching Mouse Hunter or the Deer Hunter right now.
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.400]  I want that.
[57:21.320 --> 57:22.640]  We should put that on a shirt.
[57:23.780 --> 57:26.300]  You are the intruder, Bill Mouse.
[57:29.940 --> 57:32.060]  The first union was formed here.
[57:33.660 --> 57:34.780]  In 1990.
[57:35.120 --> 57:35.320]  Right.
[57:35.900 --> 57:36.160]  Right.
[57:38.060 --> 57:39.180]  Or 1945.
[57:39.360 --> 57:39.900]  Yeah, right.
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.060]  Man, Walken's headgear would be the ultimate prop, I think.
[57:46.340 --> 57:47.060]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[57:47.320 --> 57:47.860]  It's pretty good.
[57:53.460 --> 57:55.500]  Now he's got to make a string on his own.
[58:00.770 --> 58:01.930]  Boy, what are the odds of that?
[58:06.400 --> 58:07.860]  Pretty good according to this script.
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.640]  How many buttons do you think it takes to turn on, like, a cruise ship?
[58:15.600 --> 58:16.500]  Oh my god.
[58:18.460 --> 58:21.120]  I'm going to say three keys and six buttons.
[58:21.520 --> 58:22.620]  Like an aircraft carrier.
[58:23.780 --> 58:25.140]  Do you think there is a key?
[58:25.420 --> 58:27.500]  Like, do you think it's just a regular key?
[58:28.260 --> 58:30.120]  I think there are, like, two keys.
[58:30.120 --> 58:35.120]  And if you lose it, you can't drive the super yacht anymore.
[58:36.180 --> 58:37.860]  The carnival cruise ship anymore.
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.080]  Everybody look on the ground.
[58:40.280 --> 58:41.060]  It's around here somewhere.
[58:42.640 --> 58:44.320]  We can still make Puerto Vallarta.
[58:45.220 --> 58:47.500]  The key to the cruise ship is so crazy.
[58:51.940 --> 58:52.460]  No.
[58:55.820 --> 58:58.160]  I do not understand the physics of that.
[58:59.720 --> 59:02.380]  So the mouse is doing this?
[59:03.000 --> 59:03.960]  No, he's just an idiot.
[59:04.420 --> 59:05.480]  Yeah, he just has bad luck.
[59:05.600 --> 59:06.720]  He's not with the mouse right now.
[59:07.120 --> 59:09.540]  I can't have sympathy for these guys.
[59:09.820 --> 59:11.780]  These guys, these are idiot men.
[59:11.900 --> 59:12.720]  I'm for the mouse.
[59:12.800 --> 59:14.960]  I hope the mouse kills these men cat style.
[59:18.580 --> 59:22.360]  This is like as if the wet bandits were bad at their job all the time.
[59:22.700 --> 59:24.620]  Oh no, he'll be killed.
[59:24.620 --> 59:28.360]  This is the kind of stuff that would legitimately kill Boltz.
[59:28.420 --> 59:29.760]  Oh, it's so bad.
[59:34.340 --> 59:36.000]  Yes, that's what we need.
[59:36.200 --> 59:37.940]  What is he like, ultrasounding the floor?
[59:41.360 --> 59:44.360]  Oh, I remember this very vividly.
[59:46.140 --> 59:48.160]  This was like early ASMR for me.
[59:50.260 --> 59:51.060]  In a bad way?
[59:51.620 --> 59:52.540]  What was that?
[59:52.860 --> 59:55.080]  The Nintendo console where it was all red?
[59:55.160 --> 59:55.780]  Is that what he's doing?
[59:56.680 --> 59:57.960]  Yeah, he's doing the virtual boy.
[59:58.300 --> 59:58.900]  Virtual boy.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.940]  God, that thing was terrible.
[01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:09.770]  Oh boy.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.700]  There's something really special about having such a goofy script and then giving it to a
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:28.240]  director that has such clear, thoughtful vision as far as what it should look like.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.380]  But like that's...
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:30.660]  It adds so much to it.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.400]  But like, that's...
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.140]  That's movies!
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:40.900]  What you're describing is like, that's what all movies should be, is the director should
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.560]  have like a clear vision and it doesn't like, whether it is like a big goofy thing or like a
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.000]  small, like quiet picture, it, I think both are really strong.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.940]  And Gore Verbinski is just a guy who's like, taking big cartoon swings.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.380]  And I think it's awesome.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.300]  I love it.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.180]  There isn't stuff that is like this.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.680]  This is a blast.
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:02.880]  Why did he make Lone Ranger?
[01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.430]  Like, why did he do that?
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:09.830]  Why did he make Lone Ranger?
[01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.590]  That's such a bummer.
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.190]  Could have made Mouse Hunt 2.
[01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:13.350]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.020]  Huh.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.580]  What's happening here?
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.360]  Well, hello.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:28.600]  Okay.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.580]  Hi, ladies.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.260]  I own a string factory and I killed the mayor.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.580]  My current enemy is a mouse.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.380]  About to sell it out from under my brother.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.020]  Do I smell like shit?
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.280]  Do I smell like shit?
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.780]  I was covered in shit.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.680]  Did you see him on that phone over there, ladies?
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.380]  Oh, dear.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.220]  You told me the mouse is doing this?
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.320]  Is that Mario Cantone?
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.360]  Yes.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.300]  From Sex and the City?
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.240]  Oh!
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.780]  Didn't remember that.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.640]  This is just such a big cartoon.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.560]  It's so much fun.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.160]  Walder Frey?
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.840]  Is that his outfit?
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:53.560]  Yes.
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.640]  Oh, that's great.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.540]  My wife.
[01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:12.510]  Good lord.
[01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:13.270]  Holy shit.
[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:19.350]  His dad can't believe it.
[01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:20.570]  He watched his son bone down.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.800]  You were the first movie you saw that had nudity in it?
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:28.860]  And how old you were?
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:29.840]  Oh, man.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.940]  Titanic had a tit in it.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.420]  Yeah.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.740]  That's not stuff before that.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.840]  I just don't remember what it is.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.440]  Probably Porky's.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.800]  Oh, Porky's a good one.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.000]  Oh, Animal House.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:41.500]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.340]  I remember going to a friend's house for his birthday and his stepdad rented Porky's
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.220]  and he's like, don't tell your mom.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.760]  I always remember Starship.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.120]  We should never watch that film.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.780]  No, we should absolutely never watch Porky's.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.020]  No.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.940]  I imagine it doesn't hold up.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:02.680]  No.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.380]  It wasn't holding up then.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.400]  No, I was going to say.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.480]  And everything held up then.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.240]  Yep.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.480]  Jeff, did you see that Topps released a Robert Oppenheimer autograph card?
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.040]  No, I did not.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.400]  Did they really?
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:19.700]  Breaking.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.500]  Robert Oppenheimer's first ever autograph card is here.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.860]  A very difficult signature to find.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.660]  What?
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:28.380]  This is crazy.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.780]  And the 2024 Transcendent set.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.200]  So be on the lookout.
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.800]  I don't collect Transcendent.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.600]  Good to know.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.300]  Uh oh.
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.220]  Oh my god, the mouse is evil?
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.400]  No, he's just clever.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.480]  This is awesome.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:48.880]  This is so, this is so cool.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.560]  The mouse is going to kill this guy.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.580]  Oh, such a cartoon.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.840]  He's already dead.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.220]  I wonder if that sucked filming that.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:08.840]  Oh.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.280]  Oh, it's so cool.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.820]  It's such, it's so cool.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.520]  Practical set.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.060]  He doesn't even look like Christopher Walken there.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:27.660]  No.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.300]  Shot on his mouth.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.280]  He took a shit on him.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.640]  That's a long walk back for that mouse too.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.440]  That's a really good point.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.580]  He's got tiny little legs.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.120]  They knew about concussions back then?
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:50.980]  Yeah, but they kept them secret.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.100]  This isn't the NFL.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.180]  Back then in 1905.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.240]  Belgian hair models.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.260]  I've heard of that scene.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.100]  Does he have life insurance?
[01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:26.430]  Just...
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.680]  The timing on so many of these things are so funny.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.200]  He's just wearing the little hat.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:37.840]  It's great.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.280]  What the fuck could that mean?
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:53.880]  What the hell?
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.380]  Uh oh.
[01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:21.590]  Oh no.
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:22.390]  Uh oh.
[01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.050]  What happened to Caesar?
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.110]  Who the fuck is Caesar?
[01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.710]  Oh.
[01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.970]  Christopher Walken.
[01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:28.290]  Walken.
[01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.470]  What the fuck?
[01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.170]  It's like a scene from Apocalypse Now.
[01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:53.990]  He never phones it in.
[01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:54.330]  No.
[01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:57.950]  They're everywhere.
[01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:59.250]  He's screaming in the background.
[01:08:00.210 --> 01:08:02.050]  He's locked in a trunk in the attic.
[01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:07.190]  How did he get him back in the attic?
[01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:09.750]  Yeah, like, how did he get all the way back up there?
[01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:54.490]  Mouse just wanted to sleep peacefully.
[01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:57.690]  A little bed and a white setter on his bed.
[01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:05.010]  And he ate all the peanut butter.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.860]  It's like a local mouse travel.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.560]  Did he say arugula?
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:40.900]  What?
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.080]  Why?
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.060]  Idiots.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.560]  They didn't want to crush the sandwich?
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:49.960]  Crush him into the sandwich.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.220]  It would hurt so much to get hit with a frying pan like that.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:54.600]  Yeah.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.780]  It would be the worst.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:56.720]  A cast iron.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.960]  Jessica in the chat said this mouse is a chef.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.180]  Yeah, uh, the movie poster for this is the mouse as a chef.
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.620]  He's got a little hat on and everything.
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.180]  Yeah.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:14.320]  We call him the original Ratatouille.
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.220]  One of the first chef mice.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.100]  Oh my god, he went all the way up there?
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.120]  He's a pioneer, honestly.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.700]  One of the first chef mice.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.300]  He looks like Leatherface.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.540]  He's breaking ground here.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.140]  It's at this moment in which I have to say, Gavin, you're right.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.800]  This is the third best Home Alone movie.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.060]  This is absolutely Home Alone.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.840]  I totally agree.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.780]  Such good little set pieces.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.780]  It's really fun.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:37.340]  Oh, he's...
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.060]  This mouse is full Kevin McCallister at this point and it's great.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.820]  It's going for the gas hole.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.140]  I just don't get why you don't like Home Alone 1 and 2.
[01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:53.210]  Oh god.
[01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.990]  Oh fuck.
[01:10:56.690 --> 01:10:58.910]  Mouse is just straight up going for death.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.480]  Does he get blown out?
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.200]  If he gets blown up the top?
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.740]  Oh, yeah!
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.400]  He lit the beam.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.180]  Does he ever get blown out the top?
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:32.760]  Holy shit.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.260]  Oh my god, the beacons are lit.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.520]  Gondor calls for aid.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.420]  In the bathtub.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.720]  Sacramento wins.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.500]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:48.050]  I think this is the bit where the cabinet falls on his fingers.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.370]  I remember this.
[01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:52.830]  Wow, he looks...
[01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:56.390]  He looks like Christopher Walken.
[01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:06.390]  Oh, he has a wedding ring on too.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.180]  I think Mouse Hunt should have won an Oscar.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.740]  Are we sure it didn't?
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.260]  Let me look.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:41.820]  A shotgun?
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.600]  What the fuck have they been doing this whole time?
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.620]  Not shooting the mouse.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:55.000]  It was nominated for a Saturn Award, Best Fantasy Film.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.540]  And a Key Art Award, Best of Show Audiovisual.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.860]  And a Kid's Choice Award.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.320]  And it was for a Blimp Award, Favorite Animal Star.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.400]  But it was simply a nominee.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.520]  Ah, I wonder what beat it out.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.880]  I don't know, let me look.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.900]  I heard the favorite kid's quote from this film was, she took me.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.620]  She, no, we did it only in a way of seeing a nature show.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.420]  Kid's Choice Awards.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.040]  Favorite Animal Star.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.740]  I get it, it's probably Air Bud, right?
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.200]  Isn't this the end of the first level in Ratatouille?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:31.920]  It sort of is, yeah.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:32.480]  Yes, it is.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.280]  Salem the Cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.360]  Hard to compete with that.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.560]  Yeah, I mean, smart-ass cat.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.560]  I gotta see who the nominees were, though.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:46.120]  Let me see.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.320]  Buddy from Air Bud.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:51.820]  Mouse from Mouse Hunt.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.860]  Willy from Free Willy 3 The Rescue.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:55.580]  Oh, really?
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.880]  Dude, Andrew, favorite video game.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.200]  From the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Awards 98.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.440]  Star Fox 64.
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.880]  Okay, okay.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.260]  Diddy's Kong Quest.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.400]  Super Mario 64.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.220]  Super Mario World 2 Yoshi's Island.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.320]  Which one of those do you think won?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  Diddy's Kong Quest?
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.340]  Super Mario 64.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.680]  How are they all Nintendo games?
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.040]  Oh my god!
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.060]  What?
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.500]  What the fuck just happened?
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.220]  He shot the bug bomb.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.100]  These guys rock!
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.380]  The bug bomb!
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.080]  See, that's some Home Alone shit.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.120]  That's Home Alone 2, right there.
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.720]  That was Plan G.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.100]  That was Plan G.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.460]  That's pretty good, man.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.540]  That stunt was wicked.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:48.280]  Yeah.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.140]  Mr. Smuntz, this is Vinny from Zeppo.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.760]  Jesus Christ.
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.160]  And now the Mafia's gonna kill us.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:48.120]  He sounds like the guy from Condor Band when he's in...
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:48.820]  Yes.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.160]  ...Helladolli.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.080]  Man, that movie was so enjoyable.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.780]  It's fucking classic, man.
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.000]  Aside from...
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.340]  Three or four minutes of it that we don't talk about.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:58.540]  Yeah.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.580]  When he falls off the...
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:08.260]  ...the ski lift or whatever.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.540]  That's the funniest bit in the whole movie.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.280]  Fucking cinematic art.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.340]  How much for the rights to Condor Man be?
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.920]  More than you would.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:28.140]  Probably a lot.
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:28.600]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.220]  Who owns the rights to Condor Man?
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:32.500]  Disney?
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:33.640]  Who owned...
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.060]  Is that right?
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:34.560]  Yeah, it was Disney.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.220]  Yeah, I believe so.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.280]  It was a Disney movie.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.960]  Shit, we'll never get it.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.720]  They put Condor Man in one of the Toy Story shorts one time.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.220]  Paramount...
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:43.760]  Oh, yeah.
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.060]  Paramount Global owns the rights to Condor Man.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.040]  Hmm.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.320]  I actually saw that short the other day, Jeff.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:49.760]  Oh, really?
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.320]  Oh.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:50.740]  Yes.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.280]  I've never seen it. I just always see a reference.
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:54.080]  Is it good?
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:55.900]  It's pretty funny.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.600]  I think I like some of the Toy Story shorts more than the...
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.880]  at least the first two movies.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.360]  Yeah.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.720]  Animation looks great.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:12.140]  These guys had to spend a lot of this movie dirty.
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:13.680]  Yeah, it sucks.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.320]  Yeah.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.180]  There's long days when you're covered in...
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.580]  It'd be interesting to know the sequence in which they filmed this.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.860]  Oh, yeah, that would be interesting.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.220]  Like, it starts with this.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:24.860]  Yes.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.400]  That would be funny if you could watch like a pop-up video version of a movie
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.980]  where every time it cuts to a new shot tells you what day it was shot on.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:34.380]  Yeah.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:35.180]  Oh, no!
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:35.560]  Oh!
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.100]  No, the mouse!
[01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:45.590]  He's down.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.100]  Well, get him out.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.800]  Just scoop him up and throw him outside.
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.300]  Smash him against the wall.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:56.780]  Just get rid of him.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.360]  You don't have to kill him.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.180]  Smash him against the wall.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560]  I couldn't do it.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.920]  If a mouse was like that, I couldn't kill it.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.740]  No, I couldn't do it either.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.220]  I'd feel it too much.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.220]  I'd feel the squelch.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.680]  I tried to kill a bug at the 100% eat office the other day
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.340]  and Jordan made me scoop it up and put it outside in the fucking snow.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.640]  And it was like, you think it's better?
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:19.700]  What is this?
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:20.920]  Just get it out.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:22.660]  Ridiculous.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.600]  Just buy a ticket to Hawaii.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.420]  I can't kill it.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.960]  He tried to light you on fire.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.260]  He used you as a bullet.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.680]  Yeah, look at your face.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.380]  To Fidel Castro?
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:42.940]  Wait.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.300]  It's not sporting, but he didn't put holes in the...
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:51.520]  Okay.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.840]  Yeah, we'll kill him slow, baby.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.320]  Suffocation.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.360]  Is on the table.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.800]  Is it a felony to mail an animal in a box?
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:01.780]  Gotta be.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.340]  I think you have to declare it.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.940]  There's a mouse in here.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.860]  I declare this is mice.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.320]  Mice.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.680]  Surely you can't mail to Cuba.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.080]  Well, we don't know when this took place.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.480]  It's true.
[01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:25.310]  Fair point.
[01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.950]  News radio.
[01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:41.240]  I still have those.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.620]  Yeah, the mail trucks?
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:45.140]  Yeah.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.760]  That was taken from GoldenEye.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:51.620]  What?
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:55.640]  It's gonna actually reach Castro?
[01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.410]  Insufficient postage.
[01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:16.340]  Oh, but what if one mouse lived in it?
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.560]  They got their stairs fixed real fast.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.480]  Boarded up that hole.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.040]  This is the same fucking house.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.400]  Yeah, look at the walls.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.480]  They don't have the money to pay their employees, but they have tuxedos and they did all that
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.260]  carpentry work.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.620]  Yeah, but it's because one mouse doesn't live there now, Jeff.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:37.160]  God.
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.220]  The woman helped pay for everything.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:39.900]  Yeah, she paid.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.320]  So all is forgiven and saved and settled.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.040]  And they boned like a nature documentary.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.560]  I wonder if they still talk.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.920]  Yeah, but he'd be proud of it.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:04.740]  I was wondering that too.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.240]  Yeah, but only about the mouse.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.200]  Lee Evans has got to be like 60 now.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.120]  How old do you think Nathan Lane is?
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.260]  Older than that.
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.060]  Do you think they went to the mouse's funeral when it died?
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.640]  I don't think the mouse had a funeral, probably.
[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.480]  He just went straight to... they just stuffed it immediately and threw it.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.780]  I was thinking more like how Alan Cumming has stayed in the life of that monkey he worked
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.300]  with that day.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.800]  Jeff desperately wants this mouse to be alive.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.540]  You know, wishful thinking.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.680]  Oh, good lord.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.320]  That's a lot of maraschino cherries.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.240]  It'd be awesome if cherries came like that from nature.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.400]  Are they real cherries, those freaking things?
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.480]  Yeah, they're like candy somehow.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.460]  They're just like soaked in sugar water or something.
[01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:08.110]  What do you think a shape tastes like with that?
[01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.650]  Guys, find out next week.
[01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:13.530]  Oh, man.
[01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:20.090]  I've never not enjoyed fruit that much before.
[01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:27.610]  The sum of their parts was not greater than the individual.
[01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:30.690]  The next regulation podcast is pretty fruit heavy.
[01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:38.670]  So these guys got back together to make... they were in the producers together in 2004,
[01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:40.730]  it looks like.
[01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:42.290]  Oh, Lee Evans was in?
[01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:43.450]  Yeah, it's Lee Evans.
[01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.910]  I've never seen it.
[01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:48.470]  But it's not the movie, I think it's just the play.
[01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:54.710]  It looks like it's just for stage, which is a lot of fun.
[01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.870]  But like, I think that's really cool that these guys got together like seven years later.
[01:22:58.230 --> 01:22:59.150]  Like, hey, remember that mouse?
[01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:01.370]  Yeah, anyway, now we're in the producers.
[01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:04.410]  But Nathan Lane was in the producers of the film too, right?
[01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:07.050]  Yes, he was with Patrick Broderick.
[01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:10.610]  I highly recommend watching...
[01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:12.070]  Did he just say Hakuna Matata?
[01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:13.250]  He sure did!
[01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:14.890]  He just said Hakuna Matata!
[01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.910]  Whoa!
[01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:18.790]  I get it, I get the reference.
[01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:20.110]  What a wonderful phrase.
[01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:21.510]  Oquan Tanzin Juan.
[01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:24.950]  My kid watched The Lion King for the first time.
[01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.810]  Oh, really?
[01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.210]  Where's his dad?
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:28.030]  Oh, God.
[01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:31.410]  Well, just show him Mufasa, the prequel that I've never heard of.
[01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:35.790]  Yeah, I'm not showing him the live action.
[01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:36.770]  All that stuff sucks.
[01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:41.250]  Every live action Disney movie is trash, except for Cinderella.
[01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:47.250]  Oh, what's that guy?
[01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:50.090]  Mr. Pitt from Seinfeld.
[01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.250]  They got the old people on lockdown in this movie.
[01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:52.510]  Yeah.
[01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:56.210]  Why would he bring it in the house?
[01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:58.770]  Why would he bring it in the house?
[01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:01.890]  The mouse already came out.
[01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:03.130]  Yeah, it'll chew through the box.
[01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.890]  It's an empty hole.
[01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:04.530]  Who's ready?
[01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.930]  Yeah, all of Lee Evans stand up.
[01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:14.110]  He starts sweating like three minutes in, and it's just soaked all the way through.
[01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:15.730]  That's incredible.
[01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:17.910]  He has towels and stuff.
[01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:21.570]  Robin Williams is like that, too.
[01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:22.370]  Oh, really?
[01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:23.070]  Yeah.
[01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:24.030]  Soaked.
[01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:27.910]  Have you noticed Gavin in the background?
[01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.750]  Or not Gavin, sorry.
[01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:29.910]  The other one, Andrew.
[01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:34.550]  In the background of the episodes of The Traitors,
[01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:37.090]  Tom Sandoval is always sweating through all of his clothes.
[01:24:37.210 --> 01:24:38.090]  Yes, yes.
[01:24:38.730 --> 01:24:42.410]  Supposedly, he was detoxing because he couldn't bring all of his whatever it is he takes.
[01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.370]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:46.390]  Yeah, and so he was just like a mess the whole time.
[01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:49.230]  Allegedly.
[01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:51.930]  They only cut to him to make him look like an ass.
[01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:54.370]  Or I guess not look, but just show how much of an ass he is.
[01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:55.650]  That's the point of him being right.
[01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:56.530]  Yes, it is.
[01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:58.030]  He's got to know that.
[01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:03.190]  At some point, he must.
[01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:06.490]  I was texting with you guys the other day, but like, I wanted...
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:09.490]  I think I'm going to watch this Taskmaster show.
[01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:11.490]  Yeah, I'm excited for you to watch it.
[01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:11.790]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:13.050]  The String!
[01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:15.450]  I just watched a couple of episodes the other day for fun.
[01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.030]  It's a good show.
[01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:18.270]  I think my favorite series is Seven.
[01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:19.510]  Who is in that one?
[01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.690]  James A. Caster and...
[01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:22.550]  Oh, great series.
[01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.550]  It's a great series.
[01:25:24.150 --> 01:25:25.330]  Do it, you pussy.
[01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.490]  I guess the new one comes out soon.
[01:25:28.530 --> 01:25:29.670]  Jason Manzoukas is in it.
[01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:30.370]  I really like him.
[01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:31.150]  I think he's so funny.
[01:25:31.170 --> 01:25:32.470]  Is it like a U.S. version of it?
[01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:34.330]  Or is he in like the British?
[01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.530]  I have no idea.
[01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.190]  No, it's the English one.
[01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:42.410]  They tried to do an American one where Alex Horne was still the assistant, but they had
[01:25:42.410 --> 01:25:44.450]  Reggie Watts as the Taskmaster.
[01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.950]  Really?
[01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:48.670]  They had dog shit chemistry and it didn't work.
[01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:49.670]  Well, yeah, it didn't work.
[01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:53.390]  But also Comedy Central was like, it has to be 30 minutes.
[01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:58.770]  Yeah, I don't understand buying a format from another country and then just changing the
[01:25:58.770 --> 01:25:59.010]  format.
[01:25:59.390 --> 01:26:02.690]  Well, I think when you're an executive, you just kind of like, go, here are my notes.
[01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:04.010]  And they go, well, these don't work.
[01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.650]  And they go, right.
[01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.750]  But these are my notes.
[01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:07.270]  Yeah, take them and use them.
[01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:09.410]  How else am I going to justify my paycheck, idiot?
[01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:10.270]  And then you disappear.
[01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:14.290]  There's a bunch of other countries versions, like there's some European ones and New Zealand
[01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:15.930]  one, and they're all like the original format.
[01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:18.530]  It's like, yeah, I hear they're good too.
[01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:19.150]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.170 --> 01:26:25.250]  The friend who introduced me to that show loves the other series versions as well, except
[01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.730]  for the U.S.
[01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:26.270]  He says it sucks.
[01:26:27.670 --> 01:26:29.950]  Is that the friend who has your copy of Left 4 Dead?
[01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:31.470]  No.
[01:26:32.890 --> 01:26:33.250]  Okay.
[01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.530]  We lost touch, sadly.
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:35.270]  Just trying to keep straight.
[01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.050]  Sad. Bummer.
[01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:37.270]  Different friend.
[01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:37.670]  Got it.
[01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:38.690]  Different friend.
[01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:42.250]  So how can I watch it?
[01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:44.090]  Do I just have to like, download it or something?
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:44.590]  Oh, is it?
[01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:44.810]  Okay.
[01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:47.350]  No, I mean, I'm not going to watch old ones.
[01:26:47.410 --> 01:26:48.210]  I'm just going to watch this one.
[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:49.090]  That's all I want to watch.
[01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:52.010]  I think it's on, probably on a streaming service somewhere.
[01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:53.370]  Because I watched it not too long ago.
[01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:56.550]  I just found it randomly browsing, maybe Amazon or something.
[01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:57.830]  Okay, cool.
[01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:58.910]  Oh, they might be on Amazon.
[01:27:00.010 --> 01:27:01.690]  I know they have everything on YouTube so far.
[01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.610]  It varies a lot.
[01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:04.250]  Some tasks are like, very okay.
[01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:06.830]  And some are just, you would never come up with them yourself.
[01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:08.610]  And they go off the rails.
[01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:14.730]  There are a lot of bass hits on that show, but it can hit some really good highs.
[01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.390]  Yeah.
[01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:17.350]  Yeah, you can get really-
[01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:19.590]  This is how I felt at every prop auction that we've done.
[01:27:20.010 --> 01:27:21.250]  Just so you guys know, this is-
[01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:22.290]  You're the cowboy?
[01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:23.090]  Yeah.
[01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:23.590]  The mouse!
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.420]  Why did he bring him inside?
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.120]  He didn't.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:31.660]  He didn't.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.900]  He was in already, Eric.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.100]  I don't believe it.
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.580]  The woman said these raisins are lovely.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.820]  And she's eating rat turds.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:39.660]  This mouse.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.420]  This mouse tricked me.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.920]  I was watching The Sting!
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.960]  That's who had mustaches like that.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.380]  I saw it for one second and it made me think of guys with mustaches.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:52.860]  That was it.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.440]  The Sting is a good movie.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.420]  I was watching The Sting.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:59.760]  It's probably the best of all the movies I had to watch in college.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:02.280]  Ooh!
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.080]  Whoa!
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.540]  You can't get away with that in 2025, buddy.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:10.360]  I don't think you can get away with it in 1987, dude.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.940]  In 1984, you could have done it.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.820]  Oh no, not in front of your wife either.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:18.800]  Oh.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:21.820]  News radio.
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:28.520]  Oh, and she's into it.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.440]  This is so funny.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.780]  He's having a rummage.
[01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:46.690]  Oh no!
[01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.710]  Put your arm down, you moron!
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.660]  Is his stand-up this physical, Gavin?
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.400]  Oh, he's all over the place.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.920]  He probably runs like a marathon on stage.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.620]  It's absolutely insane, his stand-up.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.000]  Oh, this is...
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.880]  Yeah, so this is just like every prop auction that I've been part of.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:18.460]  I'm gonna get it out.
[01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:29.450]  He looks like a monkey.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.340]  This is crazy.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.340]  Was that guy also in Seinfeld?
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.160]  Nope, that's... nope.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.260]  Oh no, another one!
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.380]  No, he's got another!
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:53.020]  So much is happening!
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.640]  Another great stunt.
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:56.040]  A fire!
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.820]  This has gone so wrong.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.460]  The mouse did this?
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:29:59.940]  Save him!
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:01.700]  He's the cause.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.120]  The catalyst, if you will.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.280]  Is he still bidding while choking?
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:08.840]  Yep.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:09.240]  No.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.160]  He's laughing at her.
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.540]  He's laughing at her!
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.660]  You're gonna die!
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.360]  16 million!
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:34.360]  This is the craziest auction I've ever seen.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.440]  The buyer's premium will be insane!
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.020]  Back in... this may not have had a premium.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:46.180]  1927.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.520]  They redid the whole house but left the mouse holes.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:00.140]  He could have made a new hole, he made a hole in the box pretty quick.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.140]  You can screw it back on, moron!
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.480]  I bet this is the kind of shit that went on in my old house right before I bought it.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.980]  Yeah, they covered the mouse holes though.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:22.740]  Swim!
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:26.920]  20 million.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.300]  Good lord!
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.220]  Sign it now, quick!
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.300]  Yeah, what do they think is currently happening?
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:41.700]  Who's they?
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:42.920]  The guys.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.560]  They've left the water running with the thing in the...
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.300]  Like, they just don't seem to care.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.980]  Like, they know that the water's still going.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.560]  Oh yeah, they've been distracted by all the money.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.020]  That's a lot of water for the space of one auction.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.560]  Especially from one garden hose.
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.320]  22 million is my last offer.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.080]  How much do you think that is worth today?
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:07.420]  About the same.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.660]  I feel like at 22 million, you wouldn't skip 3 million.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.540]  It's still edgy up a little.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.020]  Yeah.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.000]  Especially since he said, that's my last offer.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.160]  And he's like, fuck you, 3 million more.
[01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.110]  Oh no!
[01:32:28.110 --> 01:32:28.910]  No!
[01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:36.290]  I think Blaine's looking at it like a flower, twisting it around.
[01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:40.090]  Gavel, gavel, hit the...
[01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:40.550]  Oh no!
[01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:42.350]  It's not official.
[01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:45.090]  That's going to lower the price.
[01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:47.470]  Now they have to live here with the mouse, probably.
[01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:50.990]  That must have been so fun.
[01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.950]  Oh man.
[01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:53.130]  Actually, it was a night in the cold.
[01:32:53.210 --> 01:32:54.050]  I bet that was miserable.
[01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:55.290]  Oh, it'd be so cold.
[01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.950]  It's not 7 p.m. there.
[01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:01.150]  It is 3.30 a.m.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.640]  And you know, they filmed so much they didn't use.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.780]  They're like, they wanted to make sure they had plenty of coverage,
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.420]  so they didn't have to do that setup again.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.720]  How much did this movie make?
[01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.040]  Look it up.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.860]  I bet Lee Evans' stand-up tour made more than this movie.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:25.740]  Probably.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:28.600]  Worldwide box office.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:28.980]  No!
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:31.820]  $122 million.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:33.540]  Damn.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.780]  Made $61 million in the U.S., $60 million international.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:38.740]  All right.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.660]  How much did it cost to make?
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.480]  $300,000, probably.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.560]  $38 million.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:47.220]  Jesus.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.080]  That's a huge success.
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.120]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.580]  I'm surprised we didn't get a sequel.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.720]  I mean, in the U.S. it doubled its budget.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.480]  This is before anybody cared about international.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:58.220]  Yeah.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.400]  Oh, Flubber was $80 million.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.740]  Before anyone cared about international.
[01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:11.550]  Oh, Smossel.
[01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:12.270]  Oh, the string!
[01:34:12.450 --> 01:34:13.470]  Oh, he coughed it up.
[01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:15.090]  A lucky string!
[01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.370]  So the rat threw up the string?
[01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:22.830]  It's over, he's dead.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.720]  What's the life lesson they're going to take from this?
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.640]  There was never a rat to begin with.
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:36.640]  They were the rat.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.720]  Don't kill the mayor.
[01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:47.830]  Continuity on their outfits and faces must have been a nightmare.
[01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:52.990]  Oh, it's two lucky string.
[01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:55.770]  So they don't have anything?
[01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:58.490]  They still got the factory.
[01:34:58.750 --> 01:35:00.310]  Where does the mouse live?
[01:35:00.610 --> 01:35:01.630]  Guys, they have each other.
[01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:03.070]  That's all that really matters.
[01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:04.010]  And the string.
[01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:05.810]  The mouse's house is gone.
[01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:07.950]  Is the mouse under the car?
[01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:10.590]  I hope he has a little mouse suitcase.
[01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:12.750]  It's like Cape Fear!
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:18.590]  A little Robert De Niro mouse.
[01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:20.730]  Max Katie'd his ass.
[01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:21.690]  Holy shit.
[01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:26.950]  He's going to start laughing loudly in a movie theater behind them.
[01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:28.390]  Smoking a cigar.
[01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.950]  Wow.
[01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:39.370]  Wow, an exhaust is 600 degrees?
[01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:40.130]  That's crazy.
[01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.450]  I'm learning stuff from the Falcons.
[01:35:44.690 --> 01:35:45.630]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:51.810]  I started looking up Robert De Niro's tattoos in Cape Fear.
[01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:55.110]  I think...
[01:35:55.110 --> 01:35:56.010]  He was scary, that movie.
[01:35:56.150 --> 01:35:56.950]  Yeah, he was.
[01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:57.550]  So creepy.
[01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:03.830]  I think the Sideshow Bob episode of The Simpsons is one of the best parody ever done.
[01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.430]  It's so good.
[01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:07.490]  I totally agree.
[01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:14.590]  Not enough people put their knife away by stabbing it into the table.
[01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:17.410]  That should make a comeback.
[01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:19.330]  Thunk! I'm done with dinner.
[01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:20.770]  Have you ever done that?
[01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.710]  No.
[01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:22.950]  Yeah, probably.
[01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:26.850]  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:30.590]  So the mouse did this?
[01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:35.290]  But it's not regular string.
[01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:37.190]  It's string cheese!
[01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.470]  It's string cheese!
[01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:39.210]  Oh my god.
[01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:39.750]  Oh my god.
[01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:41.170]  They're gonna be rich.
[01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.990]  They're gonna be rich.
[01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:43.070]  This might be a true story.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.440]  Borden, is that you?
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.580]  This is insane.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:56.840]  I would eat cheese like that.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:57.840]  Me too.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:58.640]  That seems fun.
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:03.020]  Vinny in the chat, are you fucking kidding me?
[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.490]  Best goddamn cheese I've ever had.
[01:37:19.690 --> 01:37:21.050]  That's right, you bitches.
[01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:23.950]  Give a little mouse salute.
[01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:24.910]  Come on.
[01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:29.130]  I like that they didn't change any of the machinery though.
[01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:30.470]  It's still the same old shit.
[01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:34.230]  They hired the oldest people they could find to work the cheese.
[01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:36.870]  It's the old original crew.
[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:38.990]  I don't know.
[01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:39.650]  They look older.
[01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:42.310]  Yeah, this is not how the original crew looked.
[01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.950]  Oh, okay.
[01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:46.910]  Cheese-based products.
[01:37:50.890 --> 01:37:51.870]  I'll take that, please.
[01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:52.590]  Thank you.
[01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:56.090]  Yeah!
[01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:57.250]  He's wearing a little hat.
[01:37:57.370 --> 01:37:58.030]  Oh, he hates it.
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:03.320]  A little curry?
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:06.260]  Oh, he loves it.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:07.000]  He ate it like spaghetti.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.920]  He howls around it.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:09.420]  That's good.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.680]  They string the herring.
[01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:18.490]  Peanut butter and jelly provolone?
[01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:21.890]  I want to talk to you about expansion in marketing.
[01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:23.390]  Mr. Mouse, please.
[01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:26.690]  I'm going to go eat some sharp cheddar after this.
[01:38:27.050 --> 01:38:27.910]  Dude, me too.
[01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:31.670]  We're doing we're making rat moves after this one, dude.
[01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:35.670]  We're right at the end of the movie and in the chat.
[01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:37.630]  Yeah, my suspension of disbelief is dead.
[01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:40.310]  Not wheels on the bus.
[01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:44.830]  A world without string is chaos and up next is wheels on the bus.
[01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:47.410]  Oh, I think that's the guy that died.
[01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:48.870]  I think it might be.
[01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:50.450]  Mr. Smuntz?
[01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.810]  Yeah.
[01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:53.030]  What a movie.
[01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:54.310]  That was so much fun.
[01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:55.530]  Yeah, so much fun.
[01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:57.470]  So glad you brought that into my life.
[01:38:57.570 --> 01:38:57.890]  Crazy.
[01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:00.190]  Home Alone 1, Home Alone 2, Mouse Hunt.
[01:39:00.610 --> 01:39:00.830]  Yeah.
[01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:02.770]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:04.570]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:08.710]  Falcons, thank you for being here to watch Mouse Hunt with us.
[01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.810]  Who would have thought that Mouse Hunt would have been that much fun?
[01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:11.450]  That was...
[01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:13.550]  What are we watching next, Falcons?
[01:39:14.410 --> 01:39:16.110]  Well, it'll have to be put to a vote, I suppose.
[01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:16.490]  Air Force One.
[01:39:16.930 --> 01:39:18.730]  Somebody said there's a post-credit scene.
[01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.250]  What?
[01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:21.310]  There's no way.
[01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:22.730]  That doesn't sound right.
[01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:23.270]  Let's see.
[01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.330]  Skip ahead.
[01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:25.990]  I'm just trying to get us to stick around.
[01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:29.710]  Do we put the movies that weren't picked back into the list?
[01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:30.370]  Or do we pick all the movies?
[01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:31.650]  Why wouldn't you just skip ahead, Nick?
[01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:32.570]  Why are you Googling it?
[01:39:33.130 --> 01:39:34.790]  Because we're watching it with other people.
[01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:35.270]  Okay.
[01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:36.970]  It's the post-credit scene.
[01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.410]  Who cares?
[01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:38.510]  All right, fuck them.
[01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:40.830]  There's a guy named Lester Dinkus?
[01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.050]  That's rude.
[01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:43.270]  All right, everybody skip ahead.
[01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:46.150]  Uh-oh.
[01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:48.010]  Who is Lester Dinkus?
[01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:48.690]  I don't know.
[01:39:48.690 --> 01:39:50.210]  It just said Lester Dinkus.
[01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:52.210]  And then it was like the character name.
[01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:52.590]  Dinkus is it?
[01:39:53.470 --> 01:39:53.990]  Let's see.
[01:39:54.670 --> 01:39:54.890]  Nope.
[01:39:57.910 --> 01:40:01.150]  If you hover over, I think it shows like a thumbnail of it.
[01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:03.050]  Boy, Nick's being a real Dinkus right now.
[01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:04.430]  Yeah, he's being a Lester Dinkus.
[01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:08.030]  Okay, let's see.
[01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:08.450]  Post-credit.
[01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:09.270]  All right, it looks...
[01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:10.550]  Wow, paramount.
[01:40:10.730 --> 01:40:11.730]  Does the mouse climb the...
[01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:14.090]  Let's see.
[01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:17.670]  Bullshit.
[01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:18.890]  Deutsche Stiemen.
[01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:20.490]  Joker, you pieces.
[01:40:20.690 --> 01:40:21.270]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:24.130]  You trust with a guy named Joker?
[01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:25.170]  Dude, no kidding.
[01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:26.590]  He said, nah, I apologize.
[01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:30.710]  All right, well.
[01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:33.350]  I can't believe Joker tricked me.
[01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:35.030]  Who would have thought that Joker...
[01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:36.370]  Of all people.
[01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:38.110]  Who would have guessed?
[01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.550]  Oh.
[01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:40.550]  Well, this was so much fun.
[01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:41.930]  Yeah, thanks for picking my movie.
[01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:46.130]  Thank you so much for joining us in this mouse hunt watch-along.
[01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:49.110]  I can't wait for us to watch whatever we watch next.
[01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:50.310]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:51.230]  I agree.
[01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:51.530]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:53.150]  I just want Andrew to do the outro.
[01:40:53.710 --> 01:40:54.570]  Oh, I didn't know I was...
[01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:56.210]  I was waiting for someone else to pop in.
[01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:58.310]  Uh, thank you so much for watching.
[01:40:58.910 --> 01:41:00.270]  I thought you were doing a really good job.
[01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:01.890]  I was not, I was just kind of talking.
[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.150]  I was just kind of dreaming.
[01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:04.230]  I was in the moment.
[01:41:04.330 --> 01:41:05.270]  I was just having a good time.
[01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:07.330]  Do you want to go from here or do you want to take a step back?
[01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:09.790]  It means so much to us for you to support.
[01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:11.230]  Falcons, do the outro.
[01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:13.130]  Take it one word at a time.
[01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:13.570]  Let's hear it.
[01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:14.710]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:15.570]  And sync.
[01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:16.630]  Hang on.
[01:41:17.210 --> 01:41:17.490]  No.
[01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:18.730]  So, I'm going...
[01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:21.050]  Okay, there, okay, there we go.
[01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:22.750]  We're going to wait and see.
[01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:24.410]  What are you doing?
[01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:25.410]  We're going to wait and see.
[01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:26.150]  Hang on.
[01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:27.090]  For what?
[01:41:28.230 --> 01:41:31.710]  Okay, Spummer, this is your big moment.
[01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:32.490]  Hold on.
[01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:34.990]  Spummer, you're going to do, you're going to do the outro.
[01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:39.590]  Uh, thanks for watching, uh, Falcons.
[01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:41.270]  You're from England, Spummer?
[01:41:42.230 --> 01:41:42.710]  Yeah.
[01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.770]  Gally's not happy about that.
[01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:46.290]  No, it's amazing.
[01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:48.370]  You made a new enemy today, Spummer.
[01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:50.150]  Spummer, you're a Brit.
[01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.130]  I didn't even know that.
[01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:56.370]  Oh, sorry, Gav.
[01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.850]  Sorry, Spummer.
[01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.650]  Sorry for interrupting.
[01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:00.030]  Go ahead.
[01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:02.230]  Uh, thanks for watching, Falcons.
[01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:03.910]  We'll see you next time.
[01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:05.030]  Yeah!
[01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:06.530]  Way to go, Spummer!
[01:42:07.290 --> 01:42:07.930]  Hell yeah.
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:11.990]  All right, guys, that was the outro done by Spummer.
[01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:13.550]  All Spumheads unite.
[01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.350]  And we'll see you next time, guys.
[01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:16.070]  Bye!
