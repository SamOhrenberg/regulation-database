[00:29.860 --> 00:36.440]  Attention! This is a regulation announcement from the current timeline. It is today.
[00:36.780 --> 00:40.580]  I am speaking to you from today, not from the future, not from the past.
[00:40.900 --> 00:46.120]  I have very important news to you because coming soon on what day, Gavin?
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.820]  Friday, November 22nd.
[00:50.340 --> 00:54.780]  That's right, Andrew. Friday, November 22nd at...
[00:54.780 --> 00:59.680]  Checking my watch. Noon Central time. It becomes GURP Friday.
[00:59.840 --> 01:06.200]  We release the GURP-ler to the world via our store. Gavin?
[01:07.580 --> 01:14.760]  Regulationstore.com or regulationstore.store. The first ever regulation GURP-ler.
[01:15.040 --> 01:18.920]  After you've bought one, pop on over to Twitch. Why is that, Andrew?
[01:19.360 --> 01:23.440]  Because we'll be streaming Mario Party at noon central.
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.580]  The return of Dilkong. The rematch.
[01:26.740 --> 01:31.580]  And if you don't know what that address is, I do, and I'm prepared to share it with you.
[01:32.060 --> 01:33.840]  RegulationPod. Now. At Twitch.
[01:33.860 --> 01:38.740]  Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod. He said RegulationPod at Twitch.
[01:38.740 --> 01:43.660]  He said it wrong. He said it wrong. Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod.
[01:43.840 --> 01:48.220]  This ends your regulation announcement. Thank you for your ears.
[01:48.220 --> 01:52.240]  Clearly the website is not RegulationPod for where we're streaming.
[01:55.220 --> 01:59.120]  Kick exists. There's all sorts of platforms out there. You gotta let them know. It's at Twitch.
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.400]  At Twitch. What?
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.680]  What would you call it? Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod.
[02:07.060 --> 02:09.700]  If you say at, it means it's like a handle or an email address.
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.620]  Yeah. No, it's also a word.
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.100]  That's not my fucking problem. You're thinking about cyber stuff.
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.300]  For real, this is the end of the announcement. We now return you to your regularly scheduled
[02:23.300 --> 02:27.090]  current timeline programming. Gavin, make the noise.
[02:27.860 --> 02:28.460]  I'm in flat circle.
[02:29.280 --> 02:34.300]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[02:34.360 --> 02:40.660]  With me, as always, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Baddour. This is episode 27.
[02:40.660 --> 02:45.200]  I feel like 27 is such an unspecial number.
[02:45.860 --> 02:48.380]  Really? I like 27 as a number.
[02:48.740 --> 02:51.740]  What would you say the least special number is?
[02:51.960 --> 02:55.280]  I don't know. I just don't think anyone would ever celebrate the 27th of something.
[02:55.820 --> 02:56.920]  What day is your birthday, Gavin?
[02:58.120 --> 02:59.180]  23rd. 23rd.
[02:59.280 --> 02:59.960]  Unmemorable, I think.
[03:00.480 --> 03:02.620]  Does anybody remember their 27th birthday?
[03:03.260 --> 03:04.480]  Ooh, what was I doing?
[03:05.940 --> 03:06.140]  No.
[03:06.380 --> 03:07.840]  I was probably playing Minecraft.
[03:10.040 --> 03:11.020]  No, absolutely not.
[03:11.220 --> 03:11.540]  I don't.
[03:11.740 --> 03:12.520]  Absolutely no clue.
[03:12.880 --> 03:14.040]  No idea. No clue.
[03:14.840 --> 03:20.180]  But 27 is the 27 Club. Just a bunch of famous people who die at 27. That's what I think of.
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.160]  You know, I almost did an episode of Soul Ride about that 27 Club because people kept asking
[03:24.160 --> 03:27.420]  me to do it. And the more you look into it, there really aren't that a higher number of
[03:27.420 --> 03:31.700]  people that die at 27 at all. I did. I was contrasting it. I don't know why I never
[03:31.700 --> 03:36.620]  released it, but I did a 27 versus a 49 Club. And there are a lot of people that die at 49.
[03:36.620 --> 03:41.080]  Way more celebrities died at 49 than 27, which still seems too young to me.
[03:41.400 --> 03:43.860]  Maybe we need to do a draft where there's just years.
[03:45.020 --> 03:49.020]  And you have to put a celebrity who died at that age.
[03:50.840 --> 03:51.280]  What?
[03:51.740 --> 03:52.180]  What?
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.780]  You can't also say what. You would have to explain what you mean.
[03:58.580 --> 04:02.420]  I just really, I've really been enjoying the drafts. I'm trying to make everything a draft,
[04:02.580 --> 04:03.540]  but that doesn't really fit.
[04:03.540 --> 04:07.180]  Dogs and Cream is a new weird level for us.
[04:07.440 --> 04:10.760]  Dogs and Cream was our first double draft, and I think it went very well.
[04:10.840 --> 04:11.480]  It was so much fun.
[04:11.820 --> 04:15.560]  Whereas the kicker, picker, repicker was an absolute calamity
[04:16.100 --> 04:18.900]  and maybe the craziest thing we've ever made.
[04:18.940 --> 04:24.060]  So that has come out now as of this recording or this release, right? Yeah.
[04:24.780 --> 04:30.720]  I am so interested to see what the audience's take on that is because I felt like in the moment
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.100]  we were creating something that we were going to be stuck with forever, potentially in this wheel.
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.620]  But then because we're recording so far in advance, we all forgot about it and went back
[04:40.620 --> 04:43.320]  about our lives. And now the audience is going to get it dropped on them.
[04:43.340 --> 04:45.900]  And I assume it'll be dropped on us again, too. You know what I mean?
[04:45.940 --> 04:49.420]  I haven't stopped thinking about it. The moving on thing is not a thing I did.
[04:49.860 --> 04:54.940]  It's a funny recording because you start out not into it, Jeff,
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.200]  in the sense that you're just like, this is what are we doing?
[04:57.200 --> 05:02.480]  And then there's a shift that happens maybe halfway where everybody gets all in on the wheel.
[05:03.460 --> 05:08.240]  You bringing in just the concept of stealing other players was absolutely insane.
[05:10.140 --> 05:12.320]  It totally changed the entire game.
[05:12.620 --> 05:17.900]  Yeah, see, my flip was accepting that this isn't going to be a contest where we
[05:17.900 --> 05:21.920]  genuinely pick the best players and then the person with the best selections wins
[05:21.920 --> 05:26.860]  because once we break the seal on theft, then it's just out the window.
[05:26.860 --> 05:30.500]  So when I was able to reframe that in my head and go like, oh, OK, it's nonsense.
[05:30.660 --> 05:32.520]  Just lean into the nonsense.
[05:32.720 --> 05:35.180]  Then the wheel became the most entertaining thing on Earth to me.
[05:35.500 --> 05:39.760]  As a big reality show fan, I thought you would appreciate the midseason twist, Jeff.
[05:40.060 --> 05:40.660]  I was shocked.
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.120]  Why weren't we there?
[05:42.380 --> 05:44.940]  Why weren't we out there stealing each other's movies then this summer?
[05:45.440 --> 05:46.680]  Because that's not that game.
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.980]  It's a different game, right?
[05:48.240 --> 05:49.420]  That's a completely different game.
[05:49.800 --> 05:50.560]  I understand the difference.
[05:50.720 --> 05:53.080]  That's like Gavin, you're playing chess and saying like,
[05:53.120 --> 05:54.800]  why don't I have a get out of jail free card?
[05:54.940 --> 05:56.140]  It's a different game, dude.
[05:57.160 --> 05:57.900]  Completely unique.
[05:58.140 --> 06:03.920]  Yeah, all you have to do, Gavin, is introduce a new rule for get out of jail free cards for chess.
[06:04.080 --> 06:04.780]  And then you're good.
[06:05.080 --> 06:06.540]  Halfway through the chess season.
[06:06.860 --> 06:07.020]  Yeah.
[06:07.360 --> 06:12.240]  Should we all pick a classic game and come up with one new rule for it?
[06:12.340 --> 06:13.620]  And then we have to play them.
[06:14.160 --> 06:14.600]  That's fun.
[06:15.040 --> 06:16.380]  I love that idea.
[06:17.860 --> 06:19.380]  What do you mean by like a board game?
[06:19.440 --> 06:20.620]  Is that what you mean by classic game?
[06:20.740 --> 06:22.900]  Yeah, like, for example, you might be able to get monopoly
[06:22.900 --> 06:26.220]  and your new rule might be that one person has a gun.
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.680]  How does that change monopoly?
[06:28.680 --> 06:29.860]  Don't know, however you want.
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.340]  Well, no, you do have to know. It's your rule.
[06:32.560 --> 06:33.860]  What do you mean? You have to know.
[06:33.940 --> 06:34.540]  Well, it's your rule.
[06:35.020 --> 06:38.100]  It's my rule? My rule is that people have a gun and monopoly?
[06:38.220 --> 06:39.420]  You're assigning this to me?
[06:39.920 --> 06:40.780]  I was just throwing out something.
[06:42.120 --> 06:46.140]  I just, I feel like you're playing monopoly in a more intimidating way with your throw out.
[06:46.760 --> 06:50.900]  It says, Gavin has presented like two ideas in this episode.
[06:51.140 --> 06:55.380]  At both times, it feels like he ends the idea and then just goes, what?
[06:57.180 --> 07:00.900]  Yeah, it's like he wants deer hunter, but in front of a monopoly board.
[07:01.420 --> 07:05.360]  On the night, I would put more than three seconds thought into it.
[07:05.360 --> 07:07.660]  But, you know, just any classic game modified.
[07:08.820 --> 07:12.600]  You know, it's actually it's actually funny you say this, Gavin,
[07:12.680 --> 07:15.280]  because I had written down on my notes and I think where you're going with this,
[07:15.720 --> 07:17.440]  I've seen it early in this episode.
[07:17.480 --> 07:20.760]  Now, you seem to have this this desire to create right now.
[07:20.780 --> 07:25.040]  You're trying to build games out of the ether right now in the moment
[07:25.040 --> 07:26.400]  without any thought or preparation.
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.520]  I have been in a similar mode where I've been writing down supplemental ideas
[07:30.520 --> 07:32.540]  for shows that are like not all the way there.
[07:32.660 --> 07:34.760]  And I was going to pitch to you guys today a couple things.
[07:35.100 --> 07:37.960]  One, I was going to say, I think it's time for us to do a sausage talk.
[07:38.040 --> 07:40.380]  We should probably put that on the books and record a sausage talk pretty soon
[07:40.380 --> 07:41.760]  before we get to the end of the year.
[07:42.140 --> 07:46.540]  But the other one is maybe we should have a supplemental game idea pitch session.
[07:47.200 --> 07:51.620]  OK, where we all bring like two or three game ideas that aren't fully baked or that are
[07:51.620 --> 07:54.520]  and then we pitch them to each other and then we, uh, I don't know,
[07:54.660 --> 07:56.340]  vote on them and see if any of them we want to make.
[07:56.740 --> 07:57.740]  Yeah, I like it.
[07:57.760 --> 08:00.620]  I like that whiteboard session we did, but a little more focused
[08:00.620 --> 08:03.460]  and with the intent of releasing it to the audience, you know?
[08:03.860 --> 08:05.200]  Now we don't own the whiteboard.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.840]  It's true, but we own all the ideas.
[08:08.100 --> 08:08.460]  That's true.
[08:08.680 --> 08:09.160]  We bought those.
[08:09.260 --> 08:11.460]  We forget to claim it in the IP transition.
[08:11.900 --> 08:13.260]  I should have put that whiteboard on the list.
[08:13.380 --> 08:15.580]  Should have put the whiteboard on the list of things we now own.
[08:15.760 --> 08:18.100]  I claimed the photo of the whiteboard and I still have that.
[08:18.280 --> 08:19.840]  Oh, OK, good. That's great.
[08:20.760 --> 08:23.240]  I'm still thinking about how to, like, switch games up
[08:23.240 --> 08:25.880]  and I can't get past Monopoly, but with a gun.
[08:26.860 --> 08:30.320]  Can you imagine opening a box of Monopoly and just seeing a gun in there and be like,
[08:30.420 --> 08:30.840]  what?
[08:31.160 --> 08:34.400]  It's just like you got the chance cards, you got the community chest, you got a Glock.
[08:35.420 --> 08:37.540]  Oh, the chance cards really put a dark turn.
[08:37.600 --> 08:40.040]  If you had a chance card and a gun and a box,
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.740]  that feels like a go places.
[08:44.620 --> 08:47.480]  Do you imagine like a fun family game and you pull a chance card
[08:47.480 --> 08:49.240]  and it's just like shoot somebody at the table?
[08:50.020 --> 08:51.060]  That's super dark.
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.500]  The stakes do not equal the level of game.
[08:55.740 --> 08:56.780]  What are you doing, Hasbro?
[08:59.140 --> 08:59.500]  Gun.
[08:59.720 --> 09:00.700]  A gun in Monopoly.
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.880]  I was when you were bringing it up, I was thinking like, oh, maybe if you roll like
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.960]  a nine, you have to give money to a player or something.
[09:10.060 --> 09:10.940]  You're just like, well, a gun.
[09:11.060 --> 09:11.760]  What about guns?
[09:11.920 --> 09:14.900]  What if you have a gun, but it only fires immunity bullets?
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.720]  I got a great idea for a game.
[09:16.780 --> 09:18.860]  Let's play snakes and ladders, but with a grenade.
[09:18.860 --> 09:20.240]  Let's put a grenade in the box.
[09:20.380 --> 09:22.840]  Let's play snakes and ladders, but with real snakes.
[09:22.920 --> 09:24.160]  But fake ladders.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.520]  Like you have to climb the ladder to escape the snakes, but the ladder doesn't work.
[09:30.540 --> 09:31.140]  It's not real.
[09:31.500 --> 09:34.380]  The ladders are inflatable and the snakes can bite them and pop them.
[09:34.600 --> 09:35.540]  It's a slippy ladder.
[09:35.940 --> 09:37.080]  I like shoots and ladders.
[09:38.700 --> 09:41.660]  But that's like a weird where you want to like slide down the slide.
[09:41.880 --> 09:42.720]  That just it's fun.
[09:43.040 --> 09:44.480]  You want the negative thing to happen.
[09:45.580 --> 09:46.160]  It's a weird frame.
[09:46.520 --> 09:47.360]  Shoots and ladders.
[09:47.460 --> 09:47.940]  Here's my game.
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.860]  Shoots and ladders.
[09:48.960 --> 09:50.880]  But one of the ladders and it's random.
[09:50.960 --> 09:52.300]  Each game is sandpaper.
[09:55.040 --> 09:56.000]  Sandpaper ladders.
[09:56.540 --> 09:57.020]  Terrible.
[09:57.400 --> 09:57.600]  Yeah.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.720]  You got to slide down sandpaper or climb up sandpaper.
[10:00.840 --> 10:02.880]  So you're just like bleeding out for the rest of the game.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.220]  Yeah, that's that's my rule.
[10:04.280 --> 10:04.780]  I don't know.
[10:05.160 --> 10:05.880]  Oh man.
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.140]  That's hmm.
[10:07.520 --> 10:11.380]  I feel like Eric is at the biggest disadvantage with this game being someone who hates games.
[10:11.560 --> 10:17.200]  I have been so silent on this because I hate all of like I just my rule would be we don't
[10:17.200 --> 10:18.260]  have to play the game.
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.080]  That's that's what I was about to say as Eric's tricky rule is monopoly.
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.680]  But if anyone rules a one through five game instantly ends.
[10:27.100 --> 10:28.060]  Yeah, I don't.
[10:28.120 --> 10:28.840]  I just don't.
[10:31.080 --> 10:31.880]  Imagine checkers.
[10:32.140 --> 10:37.120]  But every piece is one of those little rubber domes that you thumb up the bottom and then
[10:37.120 --> 10:39.600]  you have to put them down and they could fly up in the air at any moment.
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.520]  I just don't want it.
[10:42.580 --> 10:44.620]  Like my rule is don't bother setting up the board.
[10:44.620 --> 10:47.780]  Yeah, Eric's is like it's checkers, but I don't play.
[10:48.060 --> 10:48.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:48.860 --> 10:49.360]  You guys go.
[10:49.480 --> 10:51.280]  Yeah, it's checkers, but you guys go nuts.
[10:51.520 --> 10:53.080]  And the box is just a TV remote.
[10:53.160 --> 10:56.480]  And then you just watch it put on Netflix.
[10:58.240 --> 11:00.340]  I just I just that's not how I want to.
[11:00.420 --> 11:03.140]  I just don't want to spend my time playing a board game.
[11:03.180 --> 11:03.580]  I just don't.
[11:03.740 --> 11:05.300]  What about a wrestling board game?
[11:05.960 --> 11:06.300]  I don't.
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.600]  That doesn't add a layer to anything for me.
[11:09.640 --> 11:10.540]  That's just the thing.
[11:10.580 --> 11:12.420]  That's just also a thing that I like.
[11:12.420 --> 11:15.720]  But it's I don't like board games so much that I don't care.
[11:15.900 --> 11:16.620]  I just don't want it.
[11:16.660 --> 11:18.440]  What about a wrestling trivia game?
[11:18.860 --> 11:20.680]  No, I don't want to play a game.
[11:20.740 --> 11:21.740]  What about Monopoly?
[11:22.060 --> 11:24.480]  But one of the chance cards says cut a promo.
[11:24.780 --> 11:25.460]  What about that?
[11:25.860 --> 11:26.780]  What about that?
[11:26.980 --> 11:27.820]  I'm not sure.
[11:28.020 --> 11:29.340]  Jeff, do you understand that?
[11:29.400 --> 11:30.500]  I don't like board games.
[11:30.580 --> 11:31.540]  It seems like they're going.
[11:31.640 --> 11:33.620]  But what about these things that are board games?
[11:33.780 --> 11:36.280]  Hey, Eric, why don't we what about what about checkers?
[11:36.420 --> 11:39.900]  But we call the teams baby faces and heels about that.
[11:39.900 --> 11:40.760]  Ha ha ha.
[11:42.340 --> 11:43.140]  This sucks.
[11:43.480 --> 11:44.460]  Baby faces go first.
[11:44.680 --> 11:47.640]  I hate I don't like I just don't like board games.
[11:47.660 --> 11:48.540]  I don't know what to tell you, Eric.
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.240]  Once they get going, there's no stopping them.
[11:50.280 --> 11:51.640]  You just got to let them get tuckered out.
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.020]  What about real life rat maze with gambling?
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.380]  Real life rat maze?
[11:58.640 --> 12:00.600]  There's a there's a different there's a yellow rat.
[12:00.660 --> 12:01.980]  There's a blue rat, red rat.
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.340]  And then they'll start in the middle and they have to get out for the red rat.
[12:07.580 --> 12:08.800]  Do you guys know what this is?
[12:09.220 --> 12:11.180]  No, I just thought he was doing like a mouse trap thing.
[12:11.360 --> 12:16.200]  What about Gavin gets a mouse hole and we do real life mouse trap at his house?
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.700]  Gavin's Gavin's mouse hole has spawned so many people posting pictures of mouse holes.
[12:21.480 --> 12:22.120]  It's great.
[12:22.460 --> 12:23.580]  I haven't seen the comments on that.
[12:23.740 --> 12:26.740]  Am I pretty alone in not understanding the origin of mouse holes?
[12:27.820 --> 12:30.560]  Yeah, I don't think there's anyone going like I also thought this.
[12:30.660 --> 12:32.240]  It's just people posting pictures of going.
[12:32.700 --> 12:33.740]  Look at my mouse hole.
[12:33.920 --> 12:34.780]  It's just mostly that.
[12:35.120 --> 12:38.100]  You know, it'd be fun if we had a wall and we made like seven
[12:38.100 --> 12:39.960]  different style mouse holes.
[12:40.180 --> 12:43.700]  And then we released a couple of mice into the room and see which one they prefer.
[12:43.960 --> 12:45.740]  It was like a mouse hole showroom.
[12:46.060 --> 12:48.000]  Yeah, like a mouse hole showroom.
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.160]  And then we can see like which because we're all we were having a lot of opinions about
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.500]  mouse holes as humans who are never going to use it as a door, but a mouse will.
[12:56.620 --> 12:57.340]  It's their thoroughfare.
[12:57.460 --> 12:59.000]  I'd be interested to see what the mouse picks.
[12:59.460 --> 13:04.800]  I actually need to cut open one of my walls because I dropped I dropped something in it.
[13:05.180 --> 13:05.800]  What did you drop?
[13:05.800 --> 13:08.280]  Yeah, that was that was so intentionally vague.
[13:08.380 --> 13:08.980]  What did you drop?
[13:09.420 --> 13:10.400]  I was trying to remember what it was.
[13:10.500 --> 13:15.260]  I think it was like, you know, those, you know, those like, uh, magnetic.
[13:17.920 --> 13:19.580]  Ah man, there's something in this wall.
[13:19.700 --> 13:20.420]  What? I don't know.
[13:21.180 --> 13:24.760]  It was one of those things on the outside of the wall in my hand was a magnetic roller.
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.960]  And I think I was trying to snake a wire up the wall because you tie the magnet to the
[13:29.960 --> 13:32.020]  wire on the inside and then you roll out the wall.
[13:32.200 --> 13:35.340]  It's a way to like snake upwards to a specific spot.
[13:35.340 --> 13:40.720]  Anyway, I I pulled the roller away from the wall too far and it just fell into the wall.
[13:41.060 --> 13:42.900]  And now it's like behind the skirting board.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.680]  So the magnetism doesn't it's not strong enough.
[13:46.160 --> 13:47.560]  Yeah. So I have to cut the wall open.
[13:48.100 --> 13:50.060]  Or we could get a stronger magnet.
[13:50.820 --> 13:53.020]  Oh, dude, that might be the plan.
[13:53.160 --> 13:59.340]  Like one of those big Looney Tunes cartoon U shaped magnets that you have to hold with two hands.
[13:59.500 --> 14:01.820]  Because I don't I don't actually need the thing.
[14:02.340 --> 14:04.820]  I'm not desperate to get the thing out, but it was like $150.
[14:04.820 --> 14:06.900]  And if I need to use it again, I don't want to buy it again.
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.280]  What is the most powerful magnet you can buy and hold?
[14:13.000 --> 14:13.760]  Like a permanent magnet?
[14:13.980 --> 14:17.220]  That is that is the second when you go to search it in Google,
[14:17.360 --> 14:23.000]  most powerful magnet is first and then most powerful magnet you can buy is second.
[14:26.540 --> 14:28.620]  I've never considered this.
[14:28.860 --> 14:31.440]  I we need to we need to explore powerful magnets.
[14:32.380 --> 14:35.740]  Everyone when you go on like I just figured Reddit would be someone going like,
[14:35.840 --> 14:36.640]  oh, dude, it's this one.
[14:36.780 --> 14:38.180]  It's just a bunch of people going.
[14:38.340 --> 14:39.640]  My first question is why?
[14:39.940 --> 14:41.500]  And it's like, don't worry about why.
[14:42.300 --> 14:45.920]  Are we just retreading old insane clown posse territory at this point?
[14:45.920 --> 14:46.680]  Whoop whoop, dude.
[14:46.920 --> 14:47.320]  Absolutely.
[14:48.940 --> 14:50.200]  Dude, we got to get some strong magnets.
[14:50.320 --> 14:50.540]  I'm excited.
[14:50.680 --> 14:52.660]  I do like Faygo now that I'm pro Michigan.
[14:53.360 --> 14:55.060]  Dude, I Faygo sucks.
[14:55.400 --> 14:55.900]  It's all right.
[14:56.000 --> 14:56.500]  It's totally fine.
[14:58.060 --> 14:58.800]  Totally fine.
[14:58.800 --> 15:00.620]  OK, what about hide and seek?
[15:00.700 --> 15:06.760]  But the seeker is blindfolded with a giant magnet and the hiders are all wearing armor.
[15:06.900 --> 15:07.880]  Yeah, full on.
[15:07.980 --> 15:09.420]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[15:09.420 --> 15:10.260]  I love this.
[15:10.440 --> 15:13.260]  I love magnetic hide and seek.
[15:14.480 --> 15:17.640]  This is this is a jackass bit and it rocks.
[15:17.980 --> 15:19.460]  Yeah, this is a great idea.
[15:19.560 --> 15:19.920]  Magnet.
[15:19.980 --> 15:20.700]  I'm going to write that down.
[15:20.820 --> 15:22.100]  Magnetic hide and seek.
[15:23.960 --> 15:24.900]  You do.
[15:25.520 --> 15:31.260]  And then if if if the seeker finds you and you get stuck to the seeker, then the person who gets
[15:31.260 --> 15:35.100]  stuck has to then have their own magnet and they become the seeker.
[15:35.120 --> 15:36.000]  Yeah, swap.
[15:36.140 --> 15:37.160]  You just build a chain.
[15:37.380 --> 15:39.160]  You just build a chain of people.
[15:39.340 --> 15:39.760]  This is great.
[15:39.980 --> 15:40.660]  I love this.
[15:41.140 --> 15:41.900]  I'm excited.
[15:42.320 --> 15:50.260]  This is a preview of our upcoming supplemental episode, the show pitch, where everybody from
[15:50.600 --> 15:55.320]  pitches wild, crazy magnetic ideas, maybe some more magnetic than others.
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.200]  And then we we work through them.
[15:57.320 --> 16:02.240]  We workshop them in front of you, the audience via the supplemental content.
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.720]  And then maybe someday we'll make it.
[16:03.920 --> 16:06.880]  It'll be in your inbox soon.
[16:07.340 --> 16:09.740]  Imagine imagine a show where we have to pitch to the Falcons.
[16:10.160 --> 16:10.640]  Oh, that's fun.
[16:10.920 --> 16:11.840]  Oh, Falcon pitch.
[16:14.940 --> 16:19.260]  It's like Falcon Crest, but with probably less big hair.
[16:20.800 --> 16:23.560]  I what was I was I?
[16:23.640 --> 16:24.560]  Fuck, it's gone.
[16:24.660 --> 16:25.180]  Never mind.
[16:25.800 --> 16:27.180]  I had it and it was gone.
[16:27.500 --> 16:30.900]  I was just going to hang on to these ideas in case for some reason next year we like get a
[16:30.900 --> 16:35.000]  sponsor and they go, you guys have any like video ideas that's like outside of the realm of like
[16:35.000 --> 16:35.800]  the podcast?
[16:35.880 --> 16:37.760]  And I go, I got Magnetic Hide and Seek.
[16:37.920 --> 16:39.420]  And they go, here you go.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.540]  Here's $13,000.
[16:41.820 --> 16:42.640]  And you go, fantastic.
[16:42.960 --> 16:45.360]  I got a life hack I want to hit you guys with at some point today.
[16:46.200 --> 16:47.300]  Oh, hell yeah for that.
[16:48.080 --> 16:48.960]  What's your life hack?
[16:48.960 --> 16:50.400]  All right, well, I'll tell you.
[16:50.860 --> 16:55.180]  So if you've been living under a rock or in a different country lately, you'll know that
[16:55.180 --> 16:59.040]  America just went through an election, a fairly tumultuous election.
[16:59.380 --> 17:07.920]  And I consider our little podcast space to be a safe haven from the larger problems of the world.
[17:08.040 --> 17:12.180]  You know, we're just here to be done and put our fingers in each other's butts metaphorically,
[17:12.580 --> 17:12.900]  you know?
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.460]  And so I've been feeling a little bit of the stress from just like
[17:18.940 --> 17:21.820]  the constant 24-hour news cycle and I've been trying to get away from it.
[17:21.880 --> 17:25.020]  So I've developed a new way of living, not a life hack really,
[17:25.120 --> 17:26.780]  but I do have a life hack on the back end of it.
[17:26.820 --> 17:29.500]  The first thing, it's akin to shit shades, right?
[17:29.860 --> 17:33.160]  Just a way to enhance your experience a little bit better.
[17:33.460 --> 17:36.900]  Yesterday, I went to Home Depot and I was just feeling kind of in the dumps about the whole
[17:36.900 --> 17:37.240]  thing.
[17:37.720 --> 17:42.480]  And so I don't know why, but I just grabbed my headphones, my AirPods, and I put them in and
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.120]  I just walked around Home Depot listening to music and my soundtrack.
[17:46.360 --> 17:47.740]  And I was so happy.
[17:48.020 --> 17:52.120]  I thought, I'm going to become a headphones-in-at-all-times-in-public-guy.
[17:52.320 --> 17:56.000]  I think that that's going to stick where window down while I'm driving didn't.
[17:56.160 --> 17:59.520]  And the cool thing about it is you can create a soundtrack to your life, right?
[17:59.540 --> 18:04.020]  And nobody knows what it is, but you can also play songs that make fun of people that you see.
[18:04.200 --> 18:05.480]  You could listen to podcasts.
[18:05.780 --> 18:08.080]  You could just have quiet and pretend like you can't hear people.
[18:08.260 --> 18:11.560]  But you can also, if you're listening to music really loud, you can just
[18:12.640 --> 18:14.700]  pretend that you know what everybody's talking about.
[18:14.900 --> 18:17.120]  For instance, yesterday at the Home Depot,
[18:18.600 --> 18:23.060]  virtually everybody I saw was having a conversation about how great Jason Tatum
[18:23.060 --> 18:24.060]  and the Boston Celtics are.
[18:24.260 --> 18:28.920]  Whether they were a guy who was like pointing at a bandsaw to a Home Depot employee and they
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.460]  were like, yeah, I know Derek White's amazing, right?
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.200]  They call him the Buffalo.
[18:31.360 --> 18:31.780]  He's crazy.
[18:31.940 --> 18:35.280]  Or a guy over there like trying to figure out, he's like, do I want this?
[18:35.380 --> 18:36.040]  Do I want this?
[18:36.340 --> 18:37.480]  Do I want a Phillips head?
[18:37.620 --> 18:39.220]  Or maybe I want to go for an Allen wrench?
[18:39.400 --> 18:41.000]  And the other guy's like, yeah, I don't know, man.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.820]  But Joe Mazzuola is killing it with the after timeout plays that they're running.
[18:44.920 --> 18:45.580]  It's just phenomenal.
[18:46.060 --> 18:52.640]  So that's my suggestion is maybe being a headphones in at all times in public kind of guy or a
[18:52.640 --> 18:52.880]  person.
[18:52.960 --> 18:57.720]  And then you control the world around you to a degree that I didn't realize I could.
[18:58.300 --> 19:00.140]  My life hack comes on the heels of that.
[19:00.820 --> 19:02.980]  I am exhausted by the news.
[19:03.020 --> 19:08.920]  And I don't want to spend the next four years being rage baited so that corporations can
[19:08.920 --> 19:10.380]  make a lot of money off of my eyeballs.
[19:10.380 --> 19:10.880]  Right.
[19:11.380 --> 19:13.560]  So but I also don't want to be a fucking idiot.
[19:13.560 --> 19:13.820]  Right.
[19:13.860 --> 19:14.820]  So I need to strike.
[19:15.120 --> 19:25.640]  I need to straddle the line between like ignorant and not so informed that I'm miserable all
[19:25.640 --> 19:26.080]  the time.
[19:26.080 --> 19:26.340]  Right.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.420]  Here's how I'm going to do that.
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.860]  I figured out how to get my daily dose or my dose of important news.
[19:33.860 --> 19:35.580]  I'm turning off the radio.
[19:35.580 --> 19:36.760]  I'm turning off the TV.
[19:36.760 --> 19:40.740]  I'm never going to listen to or watch news programs or talk radio or any of that stuff
[19:40.740 --> 19:41.020]  again.
[19:41.940 --> 19:44.940]  I'm going to get all my news from sportscasters.
[19:45.580 --> 19:50.500]  If anything crazy or really important happens, they'll break in on a game and tell you, dude.
[19:50.740 --> 19:52.360]  Mike Breen will be like, fuck it.
[19:52.820 --> 19:54.560]  James Harden takes it up to the court.
[19:54.840 --> 19:57.520]  He's got he's got the seven assists already in the first quarter.
[19:57.660 --> 20:00.860]  And oh, it appears that Russia has invaded Ukraine.
[20:01.720 --> 20:03.360]  Harden passes over to Kawhi Leonard.
[20:03.440 --> 20:03.920]  You know what I mean?
[20:04.680 --> 20:09.520]  So without opinion or without any sensationalism, just a delivery of the words.
[20:09.580 --> 20:09.740]  Yeah.
[20:09.840 --> 20:13.360]  You just get the image watching the fucking Lions game and Chris Collinsworth is like,
[20:13.440 --> 20:15.920]  oh, it's third and 10 and Betty White has died.
[20:16.280 --> 20:17.960]  You know, and you're like, oh, OK, good enough.
[20:19.300 --> 20:20.200]  That's my life hack.
[20:20.320 --> 20:23.440]  Get your news from sportscasters because they got other agendas.
[20:23.740 --> 20:27.300]  So they got to spit it out real fast because it has to be addressed.
[20:27.480 --> 20:28.740]  And then they just go back to the game.
[20:29.200 --> 20:30.280]  So you want your news bland.
[20:31.180 --> 20:32.760]  I just want my news to be brief.
[20:33.080 --> 20:37.140]  And to the point and then back to whether James Harden is going to get a triple double or not.
[20:37.740 --> 20:40.820]  What you're saying, it reminds me of that baseball apology
[20:40.820 --> 20:42.380]  where there's a home run in the middle of it.
[20:42.460 --> 20:43.340]  And he's like giving a heartfelt.
[20:43.500 --> 20:45.680]  He said, I don't remember what he said.
[20:45.740 --> 20:47.200]  He said something horrible, I think.
[20:47.540 --> 20:47.720]  Yeah.
[20:47.780 --> 20:50.020]  And he was apologizing for being insensitive, I think.
[20:50.380 --> 20:51.520]  Yeah, he's apologizing.
[20:51.580 --> 20:53.500]  He's like, listen, it's not what we represent.
[20:53.800 --> 20:56.200]  And Otani hits the ball and it's going deep left.
[20:56.280 --> 20:57.140]  It's going to be a home run.
[20:57.500 --> 20:59.080]  We do not stand by that.
[20:59.120 --> 21:01.160]  He's got to do his job all the way out the door.
[21:01.160 --> 21:04.460]  He's like, that's a that's a 414 foot monster.
[21:04.560 --> 21:09.940]  Anyway, as I said, the job as a broadcaster is to be sensitive to it.
[21:10.740 --> 21:14.860]  I think it's really funny to listen to assume that what you're listening to
[21:14.860 --> 21:19.000]  isn't something that you've put on, but that the world around you is creating it.
[21:19.020 --> 21:20.060]  I like that a lot, Jeff.
[21:20.380 --> 21:20.620]  Yeah.
[21:20.980 --> 21:21.600]  So that's my tooth.
[21:21.660 --> 21:25.920]  I'm going to I'm going to refame my reality for the next couple of years.
[21:26.300 --> 21:29.720]  And I'm going to do that by listening to music in public
[21:29.720 --> 21:34.180]  and pretending I know what the conversations people are having are.
[21:34.700 --> 21:38.580]  And then I'm just going to get all my news from the NBA announcers.
[21:38.880 --> 21:42.340]  So how often do they do a news interruption like that?
[21:42.520 --> 21:48.600]  If there's something important and there are there's there's 10 games a night,
[21:48.620 --> 21:50.440]  you know, like I'm not I'm no shortage.
[21:50.540 --> 21:52.780]  If I want if I want any important news, I could just I'd be like,
[21:52.800 --> 21:54.680]  oh, the Grizzlies are playing the Timberwolves tonight.
[21:54.740 --> 21:57.660]  Let me tune in and see if anything happened in Palestine and Israel.
[21:57.660 --> 22:00.760]  The thing that Andrew's talking about, the
[22:01.660 --> 22:07.400]  drive deep to left field by Castellanos actually has a Wikipedia article about it
[22:07.400 --> 22:14.500]  because it's happened so many times where if you scroll down to further incidents,
[22:15.100 --> 22:22.120]  there are almost 10 where important things are being talked about.
[22:22.120 --> 22:28.780]  And Nick Castellanos crushes a ball to left field in the middle of it.
[22:29.180 --> 22:33.940]  It is two and a half hours after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek
[22:33.940 --> 22:36.580]  Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.
[22:36.640 --> 22:39.960]  And the day the news broke, Brenneman would return to national broadcast.
[22:40.220 --> 22:42.020]  Castellanos hit a home run deep to left field.
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.740]  The Phillies score the final run of a 6-0 win in the Pirates game.
[22:46.040 --> 22:51.580]  Everything about these weird references and like important historical facts
[22:51.580 --> 22:54.880]  have to do with Nick Castellanos hitting a drive to deep left.
[22:54.980 --> 22:55.820]  It's very exciting.
[22:56.440 --> 22:57.220]  That's awesome.
[22:57.800 --> 23:02.300]  I think about the people that learn that Saddam was killed by John Cena.
[23:02.760 --> 23:04.800]  Like that was the source of that information.
[23:05.380 --> 23:05.640]  Yeah.
[23:05.980 --> 23:06.600]  Oh yeah.
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.920]  They've caught and compromised to a permanent end.
[23:13.040 --> 23:15.260]  Phillies and the Orioles are playing and they're like,
[23:15.340 --> 23:19.260]  uh, just want to break in real fast to let everyone know we have killed Osama Bin Laden.
[23:20.040 --> 23:22.280]  Anyway, Bryce Harper is up to the plate, you know, it's...
[23:25.280 --> 23:26.040]  I like it.
[23:26.440 --> 23:27.740]  I think it's how I have to live now.

[23:43.320 --> 23:46.600]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.840]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[23:50.020 --> 23:53.520]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[23:53.860 --> 23:55.380]  Available for a limited time.
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.760]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.860]  My favorite part about going to Home Depots,
[23:59.920 --> 24:02.160]  I just walk around and whenever I see anyone working there,
[24:02.220 --> 24:03.920]  I just think, oh, that they could be the equalizer.
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.400]  That person, that could be the equalizer right there.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.260]  That's a really good point.
[24:08.600 --> 24:11.340]  You think, you think an equalizer exists?
[24:11.780 --> 24:15.000]  Like, um, I like to live in a world in which one does.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.520]  And if they do exist, they're working at Home Depot as established in the first movie.
[24:19.780 --> 24:21.920]  So whenever I'm in Home Depot, I just walk around going,
[24:22.040 --> 24:23.640]  oh, that could be the equalizer right there.
[24:23.720 --> 24:27.680]  And any employee could be an equalizer and any customer could be a serial killer
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.920]  getting supplies.
[24:29.480 --> 24:30.760]  Also, that's true.
[24:31.100 --> 24:35.740]  If you're listening to music or a podcast on your headphones in a place like Home Depot,
[24:35.940 --> 24:37.360]  you're not in a hurry to leave.
[24:37.740 --> 24:41.600]  Like, hanging out in Home Depot is cool if you bring the music, you know what I mean?
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.560]  It's like suddenly everywhere.
[24:43.800 --> 24:46.800]  I'm in a little less of a hurry to get out of places because I'm like,
[24:46.900 --> 24:49.780]  yeah, I got the fucking best jukebox in the world right here with me.
[24:50.220 --> 24:52.180]  Yeah, I feel like I've been doing this since Bluetooth was invented.
[24:52.660 --> 24:54.880]  Have you? I don't see you walk around with headphones in.
[24:55.340 --> 24:56.280]  Do you see me walk around?
[24:56.720 --> 24:57.460]  All the time.
[24:58.080 --> 24:58.480]  Oh.
[24:59.700 --> 25:00.820]  I've got cameras on me.
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.860]  I only see you when you walk outside to shave.
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.660]  With a broken mirror.
[25:06.940 --> 25:07.340]  Lunch.
[25:07.820 --> 25:10.600]  I also really hate loud noise.
[25:10.600 --> 25:13.260]  Like if I'm vacuuming, I have to have headphones on.
[25:13.780 --> 25:17.560]  I just think I'm never stepping foot in public without headphones in again.
[25:18.420 --> 25:21.680]  And it's also a great excuse not to ever have to talk to anybody ever again.
[25:22.220 --> 25:24.140]  Yeah, that is a great excuse.
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.960]  I usually have the transparency on there so I can hear if I'm about to be run over.
[25:29.600 --> 25:30.620]  That's a good idea.
[25:31.260 --> 25:33.120]  You typically would want to know that information.
[25:33.280 --> 25:34.860]  Yeah, I don't often noise cancel.
[25:35.200 --> 25:37.400]  I think if I was about to be run over, I wouldn't want to know.
[25:37.740 --> 25:38.760]  You don't think you could avoid it?
[25:40.600 --> 25:43.820]  If you just heard a bunch of tires squeaking and could jump out of the way,
[25:43.900 --> 25:44.340]  you wouldn't want to know?
[25:44.520 --> 25:46.380]  If I could avoid it, yes.
[25:46.460 --> 25:48.320]  But if not, I'd rather just be surprised.
[25:48.880 --> 25:50.740]  I'd rather just be like alive and happy.
[25:50.780 --> 25:52.640]  And then suddenly I'm in heaven.
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.600]  You might not die.
[25:55.580 --> 25:56.680]  You might just get tossed.
[25:57.140 --> 26:00.420]  It's pretty bold that you would assume that you would just immediately be going to heaven.
[26:00.940 --> 26:01.880]  And immediately.
[26:02.240 --> 26:03.180]  I'm on the short list.
[26:06.060 --> 26:09.320]  You think St. Peter's like a big A.H. fan or what?
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.080]  Maybe not an A.H. fan, but he liked Red Vs. Blue.
[26:13.160 --> 26:13.660]  That's fair.
[26:14.180 --> 26:15.460]  Yeah, it's pretty good, man.
[26:15.500 --> 26:16.300]  That's some strong seasons.
[26:16.780 --> 26:18.420]  Yeah, I got a few of those in my pocket.
[26:18.520 --> 26:18.740]  I'm good.
[26:19.160 --> 26:21.560]  Like, oh, you're not into Cheat Mode?
[26:21.680 --> 26:22.240]  How about Haunter?
[26:22.480 --> 26:23.320]  You like those stuff, right?
[26:23.540 --> 26:23.960]  I gotcha.
[26:24.160 --> 26:24.700]  You like game shows?
[26:25.260 --> 26:26.440]  How do you feel about Monopoly?
[26:26.520 --> 26:27.540]  I did a hardcore Mono...
[26:27.540 --> 26:28.400]  Oh, you good with that?
[26:28.600 --> 26:28.760]  Fine.
[26:30.040 --> 26:31.800]  Was there a gun in your hardcore Monopoly?
[26:31.800 --> 26:34.380]  Yeah, it sounds like your hardcore Monopoly wasn't as hardcore as mine.
[26:35.940 --> 26:39.600]  All mine had was a cage under the table that we'd lock people in.
[26:41.880 --> 26:46.180]  What was your guys' childhood landline etiquette?
[26:46.840 --> 26:48.100]  I don't even know what you... what?
[26:48.380 --> 26:50.120]  Like, you know when people had phones?
[26:50.820 --> 26:51.020]  Yeah.
[26:51.460 --> 26:52.060]  A house phone.
[26:52.560 --> 26:52.840]  Yeah.
[26:53.180 --> 26:59.560]  I never understood that as a kid, if the phone rang, we had to answer it no matter what.
[26:59.640 --> 27:03.620]  Like, if we were all having dinner and the phone rang, I would be told by my parents
[27:03.620 --> 27:07.640]  to go and answer it and tell them that we're eating and we can't... and we'll call them back.
[27:07.900 --> 27:10.580]  But it's like, isn't that the whole purpose of not answering?
[27:10.820 --> 27:13.860]  I was always so confused that I was stopping what I was doing
[27:13.860 --> 27:16.720]  to tell them I'm not available to then go back to what I was doing.
[27:16.920 --> 27:18.460]  So you wouldn't be inconvenienced.
[27:18.900 --> 27:22.840]  Right, but you also don't know what it... like, it could be an emergency.
[27:23.300 --> 27:26.000]  There could be something going on. Yeah, most of the time it's not.
[27:26.120 --> 27:31.560]  But it would be crazy, I think, to just go, no, we're not answering the phone.
[27:32.520 --> 27:34.640]  Also, you have to keep hearing it ring.
[27:34.940 --> 27:37.020]  Well, there was like a button to stop it ringing.
[27:37.980 --> 27:40.060]  At the point, though, where you walk up to hit the button.
[27:40.740 --> 27:43.660]  You would get up to hit the button to stop it ringing,
[27:43.820 --> 27:46.840]  but you wouldn't answer and say, we'll call you back in a little bit.
[27:47.220 --> 27:49.360]  I mean, that's how I wanted to do it. I wasn't allowed to do that.
[27:50.020 --> 27:53.940]  You would run across the entire house to get to the phone if it was ringing.
[27:54.420 --> 27:57.020]  You'd be outside cutting the grass. And if you'd heard the door,
[27:57.020 --> 28:00.220]  you'd run full sprint to get there. And you'd go,
[28:01.500 --> 28:03.880]  hello? And you're like, no, he's not here.
[28:04.140 --> 28:08.520]  And it was never anything. But yeah, you're right, Gav, it was very important.
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.220]  Yeah, you just had to be done. But now I feel like I ignore the phone 99% of the time.
[28:14.360 --> 28:15.220]  Yeah, nobody answers the phone.
[28:15.460 --> 28:19.760]  It's only an emergency if someone rings twice, in my opinion.
[28:20.400 --> 28:23.860]  No one's going to have an emergency and just ring once and be like, oh, it went in.
[28:23.860 --> 28:29.720]  We went from a must answer to never answer world. And that's a hard flip.
[28:29.900 --> 28:32.480]  180 degrees we flipped as a society.
[28:32.760 --> 28:35.920]  I've started even doing it with the front door. I treat that like a phone.
[28:36.020 --> 28:38.500]  I would never answer the front door. Are you kidding?
[28:40.840 --> 28:46.300]  What's it for? I just don't think knocking on someone's door should be the norm.
[28:46.980 --> 28:48.280]  How would you like it done?
[28:48.780 --> 28:54.060]  Uh, I make an appointment somehow over the phone that I won't answer.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.420]  Hey, if you want to come to my house and knock on my door, call me first.
[28:59.600 --> 29:02.440]  Also, I'm not answering that shit, so you figure it out.
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.960]  When is it? When do you ever want to answer the door when the when somebody knocks on the door
[29:07.960 --> 29:11.160]  or the doorbell rings and you look out the window and you don't recognize the person?
[29:11.260 --> 29:13.000]  When is it ever worth opening that door?
[29:13.100 --> 29:13.760]  Never. It's not.
[29:13.860 --> 29:16.200]  When are you ever like, God, I'm glad I opened that door.
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.800]  Here's what happens when someone knocks on the door.
[29:17.800 --> 29:21.220]  They stand there for a bit. Obviously, I'm not answering the door.
[29:21.620 --> 29:26.220]  And then they slip a little like tree trimming business card in the door and then they leave.
[29:26.220 --> 29:26.860]  That's what happens.
[29:27.340 --> 29:33.040]  It's true. Or some guy's got a little iPad, like glued to his hand via some strap.
[29:33.120 --> 29:37.080]  And he's like, we're installing Google in your neighborhood.
[29:37.360 --> 29:38.480]  And you're like, it's OK, I'm happy.
[29:38.760 --> 29:40.500]  And he's like, well, I think you'd be happier with Google.
[29:40.580 --> 29:44.040]  And you're like, I don't think you know me well enough to know what makes me tick.
[29:44.340 --> 29:46.240]  I'm pretty sure I'm happy with what I have.
[29:46.240 --> 29:48.120]  I think we can make you a little bit happier.
[29:48.260 --> 29:51.780]  And you're like, the only way you can make me happier is if you turned around and left right now.
[29:51.820 --> 29:54.740]  And they're like, I'm still going to pester you a little bit first.
[29:55.040 --> 29:56.900]  Dude, Jeff, I got a life hack for you.
[29:57.220 --> 29:59.160]  I've been using this. I didn't even think about it.
[29:59.440 --> 30:01.380]  When somebody comes to your door to sell you something,
[30:01.680 --> 30:04.820]  they, oh, yeah, we're, oh, we're doing pest control in the area.
[30:04.920 --> 30:05.740]  Do you want to do this thing?
[30:05.840 --> 30:09.840]  I just, no matter what it is, I just go, oh, we're actually in the process of selling right now.
[30:10.440 --> 30:12.680]  Oh, and they go, oh, OK.
[30:12.940 --> 30:13.840]  And then they leave.
[30:14.280 --> 30:16.940]  That's, I've never had a conversation go past that.
[30:17.220 --> 30:20.340]  What I've been doing this lately that's been working fairly well,
[30:20.460 --> 30:22.680]  that drives my wife crazy, is if anybody calls or,
[30:22.920 --> 30:25.620]  because sometimes I have to pick it up because I don't know if it'd be like a Millie related thing.
[30:26.200 --> 30:29.340]  And I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
[30:29.380 --> 30:31.400]  I lost my job this year. I don't have a job anymore.
[30:31.500 --> 30:32.080]  I don't have extra.
[30:32.500 --> 30:37.220]  Oh, that's real, that's a real true thing, damn.
[30:37.480 --> 30:38.780]  Yeah. And then I'm not lying.
[30:38.940 --> 30:41.040]  I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry. I got laid off.
[30:41.320 --> 30:42.820]  And then they're like, oh, sorry, man.
[30:42.820 --> 30:43.680]  I hope things turn around.
[30:43.780 --> 30:44.480]  And I'm like, yeah, me too.
[30:44.580 --> 30:48.420]  Anyway, best of luck selling that vacation package.
[30:49.060 --> 30:49.860]  That's pretty good.
[30:50.420 --> 30:52.340]  Yeah, that's pretty good one to just hold on to.
[30:52.380 --> 30:53.120]  You don't even have to lie.
[30:53.700 --> 30:56.040]  Andrew, you strike me as someone who might still have a landline.
[30:56.620 --> 30:57.860]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[30:57.980 --> 31:04.060]  I only lost the landline because the place that I moved into doesn't have a line in it.
[31:04.300 --> 31:06.520]  Do you prefer having a landline?
[31:06.760 --> 31:07.880]  I had a landline.
[31:08.600 --> 31:10.320]  How often would you say you used it?
[31:11.060 --> 31:11.300]  Never.
[31:12.820 --> 31:13.160]  Did it ring?
[31:14.480 --> 31:15.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:15.260 --> 31:16.520]  If someone called, yeah.
[31:16.980 --> 31:18.500]  Well, no, I understand the concept.
[31:19.280 --> 31:23.620]  How many people, how many people in your life, Andrew,
[31:23.840 --> 31:28.140]  how many people in your world knew your landline number and would call you?
[31:28.980 --> 31:31.300]  Not many, because I had a cell phone as well.
[31:31.360 --> 31:33.300]  So if it rang, it was a wrong number.
[31:33.700 --> 31:38.760]  Yeah, it was either a wrong number or like it was a I had ordered something
[31:38.760 --> 31:41.340]  and that was the number I used for the delivery.
[31:41.860 --> 31:43.980]  When was the last time outside of Andrew?
[31:44.240 --> 31:45.400]  It was apparently very recently.
[31:45.560 --> 31:48.120]  When was the last time the rest of you had a landline?
[31:48.260 --> 31:50.840]  Like, do you remember when you got rid of your landline?
[31:51.320 --> 31:53.580]  I mean, I had one up until I moved from England.
[31:54.080 --> 31:54.500]  Yeah.
[31:55.060 --> 31:56.240]  So when you moved to America?
[31:56.620 --> 31:56.800]  Yeah.
[31:57.380 --> 32:01.380]  It was a point of outrage when I first moved into the place I'm currently in
[32:01.380 --> 32:04.600]  that I didn't have a landline because I thought I had a bunch,
[32:04.960 --> 32:08.940]  but it turns out they were just all Ethernet outlets in places.
[32:09.300 --> 32:10.720]  There are some that are surely more helpful.
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.620]  Well, no, I mean, not when you want a landline.
[32:13.920 --> 32:17.900]  Well, you can have like a PoE VoIP phone if you want.
[32:19.320 --> 32:19.700]  A what?
[32:20.340 --> 32:22.560]  Like an internet phone powered by Ethernet.
[32:23.480 --> 32:26.400]  PoE is Prison of Elders to me. I don't know what you're talking about.
[32:26.560 --> 32:28.700]  Yeah, don't you have a you want a Prison of Elders phone?
[32:29.820 --> 32:30.800]  Power over Ethernet.
[32:31.920 --> 32:33.020]  Power of Ethernet?
[32:33.140 --> 32:34.000]  Voice over IP.
[32:34.260 --> 32:36.320]  Power over Ethernet. Jesus Christ.
[32:38.720 --> 32:40.340]  The Ethernet needs to be powered?
[32:40.340 --> 32:45.320]  You can Prison of Elders things through Ethernet.
[32:45.880 --> 32:48.760]  I don't know what that means. I just know the context of
[32:49.280 --> 32:53.720]  Prison of Elders. We did the Prison of Elders. You do it like once a week and you could get
[32:53.720 --> 32:54.520]  some gear.
[32:54.860 --> 32:55.300]  It was hard.
[32:55.700 --> 32:56.640]  It was really difficult. Yeah.
[32:57.180 --> 32:58.080]  You know what else is difficult?
[32:58.920 --> 32:59.460]  What's difficult?
[33:00.120 --> 33:03.280]  Gears of War 5 on inconceivable difficulty.
[33:03.620 --> 33:04.460]  It's thrilling. Yeah.
[33:04.820 --> 33:06.340]  So Andrew had the funniest idea.
[33:07.760 --> 33:08.680]  What was my idea?
[33:08.680 --> 33:12.000]  Well, parts one, two and three came out.
[33:12.080 --> 33:12.520]  Yes.
[33:12.860 --> 33:15.640]  And we recorded them, you know, a few months apart each, probably.
[33:16.160 --> 33:22.640]  And now Andrew has suggested we do we record every other part between episodes three and
[33:22.640 --> 33:23.360]  four coming out.
[33:24.000 --> 33:25.820]  I just think that that's going to happen.
[33:26.200 --> 33:28.780]  So we're we just recorded episodes.
[33:29.480 --> 33:29.920]  Eleven.
[33:30.300 --> 33:33.040]  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten and eleven this week, I believe.
[33:33.260 --> 33:34.760]  Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Yeah.
[33:34.880 --> 33:35.740]  Five episodes this week.
[33:35.740 --> 33:38.480]  It was a thing where before we started, Jeff was like, you guys don't know this,
[33:38.480 --> 33:41.860]  but we've been recording like two a day every day this week.
[33:41.880 --> 33:45.180]  And I just went like, yeah, man, I see you guys in this server.
[33:45.360 --> 33:47.380]  And I'm just going no fucking way.
[33:47.440 --> 33:49.160]  They're still playing this fucking game.
[33:49.660 --> 33:52.780]  I unbelievable how much time you put into it this week.
[33:52.800 --> 33:53.440]  That's crazy.
[33:53.440 --> 33:59.500]  We're playing it on the hardest difficulty and doing every side mission and collectible
[33:59.500 --> 34:01.640]  now. But we only started that halfway through.
[34:01.740 --> 34:03.500]  So we're not going to get anything for it at the end.
[34:04.340 --> 34:06.280]  Every every like hard thing we've done.
[34:06.560 --> 34:09.140]  We started just after we we could have got the achievement.
[34:10.920 --> 34:12.540]  Yeah, it's pretty futile.
[34:12.820 --> 34:16.380]  But it's been so fun. I've been looking forward to every day.
[34:16.480 --> 34:21.160]  And there's definitely a new dynamic between me and Andrew now.
[34:21.360 --> 34:21.800]  Andrew.
[34:22.200 --> 34:26.280]  So the way this works, guys, is if you haven't watched the first three videos
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.340]  and if you haven't and you want to, they're up on the Patreon, I believe.
[34:30.440 --> 34:31.020]  They're on the Patreon.
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.180]  And I just made a collections tab.
[34:33.180 --> 34:36.360]  If you click collections, there is a Gears of War collection.
[34:36.520 --> 34:37.940]  That is all the videos that are uploaded.
[34:38.340 --> 34:41.300]  Are they for book standard apart from the busted slideshow one?
[34:41.940 --> 34:44.100]  I think that's a great question.
[34:44.740 --> 34:49.880]  I believe they're available to anyone who has a Patreon account and is part of the page.
[34:50.260 --> 34:51.860]  OK, so free or paid.
[34:51.920 --> 34:52.440]  OK, great.
[34:52.860 --> 34:53.440]  That would be awesome.
[34:53.860 --> 34:54.920]  But it might be.
[34:55.040 --> 34:57.680]  I don't I can double check that really quick.
[34:58.820 --> 35:02.340]  The way Gears used to work, though, is it was four player co-op.
[35:02.340 --> 35:05.040]  This one is three player co-op, but not really.
[35:05.240 --> 35:08.040]  It's really two players get to be cogs.
[35:08.220 --> 35:11.960]  And then one player has to be the bullshit robot named Jack,
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.720]  who just opens doors and occasionally shields people.
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.620]  Even though a lot of the game is four characters running around,
[35:19.680 --> 35:21.840]  just two of them are like AI characters.
[35:21.920 --> 35:27.040]  We're on an open world level right now on a skiff with four human characters and a robot.
[35:27.380 --> 35:31.780]  And two of the human characters are just fucking AI for some reason.
[35:31.780 --> 35:34.000]  I would have been so excited to play one of them.
[35:34.200 --> 35:37.560]  Although Jeff has unlocked an ability to possess enemies.
[35:37.760 --> 35:42.260]  So briefly, in every fight, you get like 90 seconds of gameplay.
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.180]  It's true.
[35:43.360 --> 35:45.480]  I've found ways to make it fun for sure.
[35:45.600 --> 35:47.380]  I can zap and do a few things.
[35:47.960 --> 35:54.060]  But the real fun for the game for me is that I can't really help in any difficult way.
[35:54.060 --> 35:54.300]  Right.
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.580]  Other than like, oh, we need the robot to open this door or to zap this thing to turn the power off.
[36:00.580 --> 36:04.500]  When it comes to killing and fighting, it's got to be all Gavin and Andrew.
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.320]  And they are going to kill each other in real life before we get to the end of this series.
[36:10.580 --> 36:13.020]  It is so entertaining to watch them go at it.
[36:13.060 --> 36:14.760]  And they are losing their minds.
[36:15.260 --> 36:19.360]  Gavin has... he's been in full weasel mode.
[36:19.660 --> 36:20.220]  Well, here's the thing.
[36:20.580 --> 36:21.720]  Andrew called me a rabbit.
[36:21.860 --> 36:23.740]  I got demoted from weasel to rabbit.
[36:24.180 --> 36:25.040]  No, promoted, I'd say.
[36:25.400 --> 36:25.840]  Promoted.
[36:25.840 --> 36:34.160]  But what happens is that I'm like 40% rabbit mode and 60% incompetent and just not good at the game.
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.880]  But both of those add up to 100% annoyance for Andrew.
[36:39.340 --> 36:40.040]  No, it's not.
[36:40.140 --> 36:42.060]  I don't mind you being bad at the game.
[36:42.220 --> 36:43.340]  That's totally fine.
[36:43.540 --> 36:44.500]  That's not an issue.
[36:45.440 --> 36:50.900]  It's... you will... you have... you know how to needle me in just the perfect way of like,
[36:50.920 --> 36:51.620]  we know each other.
[36:51.780 --> 36:54.660]  But it's not... it's not needling in a way of like,
[36:54.660 --> 36:57.420]  I'm actually like upset and that will carry over.
[36:57.640 --> 36:59.540]  It's just in the moment of like, you piece of shit.
[36:59.620 --> 37:01.700]  Like, fuck you, you son of a bitch.
[37:02.100 --> 37:04.840]  He's really precise about how he wields it too.
[37:05.140 --> 37:10.180]  Like, he'll be fine until like the 23rd attempt at a boss fight.
[37:10.800 --> 37:11.800]  You know what I mean?
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.820]  But when morale is really low and it really... you're really susceptible to it.
[37:18.060 --> 37:23.280]  Well, I feel like it spices the team back up because sometimes we start off and it's like,
[37:23.340 --> 37:24.160]  yeah, let's do it.
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.300]  On the 37th attempt at a boss fight, it's just complete silence from beginning to end.
[37:30.760 --> 37:34.480]  Poor Nick doesn't know it, but he's turned into a verb whenever anybody's spiraling
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.820]  and just like fucking losing their ability to play.
[37:36.940 --> 37:37.440]  They're Nicking it.
[37:38.780 --> 37:42.260]  So just to clarify for the Gears of War thing, it is bogged standard and up.
[37:42.360 --> 37:45.560]  So any level of membership, you can watch those videos that are currently up.
[37:46.980 --> 37:48.260]  It has been a process.
[37:48.480 --> 37:49.380]  Yeah, it is.
[37:49.380 --> 37:53.960]  I would say there is only one time where I like really unloaded on Gavin,
[37:54.220 --> 37:57.260]  but even then it wasn't like I was truly mad.
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.580]  It was just, he's a son of a bitch.
[38:00.020 --> 38:03.480]  Well, and that was also... I was just using the words you used against me yesterday.
[38:04.420 --> 38:07.280]  Just back against you and it was at the wrong time.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.880]  There's a fucking mechanic in the game where you could...
[38:11.880 --> 38:17.080]  half of the game, you're in the snow on an ice planet, like an Empire Strikes Back.
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.280]  And you fight enemies.
[38:20.500 --> 38:23.680]  You learn that you can shoot the ground out from under them, the ice out from under them,
[38:23.720 --> 38:25.640]  and then they'll drown in the water.
[38:26.020 --> 38:33.600]  We got to a particularly difficult point where I want to say we probably spent 25 to 35 minutes
[38:33.600 --> 38:36.840]  trying to beat this one section of the game.
[38:36.960 --> 38:39.900]  And we finally, finally did.
[38:40.180 --> 38:44.520]  And the moment it like... there's like a little cut scene and it returns you to the characters.
[38:44.580 --> 38:46.960]  By the way, this game is stingy as dicks.
[38:47.080 --> 38:48.180]  With checkpoints.
[38:48.340 --> 38:51.800]  But the second it cuts back in, we start walking across the...
[38:51.800 --> 38:54.560]  Well, I robot across and Andrew and Gavin are walking across.
[38:54.780 --> 38:59.460]  And I look back and then Andrew's just a popsicle floating around in the water, frozen.
[39:00.240 --> 39:04.660]  Gavin just shot the ground out from under him immediately after getting past that point.
[39:05.320 --> 39:06.020]  No checkpoint.
[39:06.560 --> 39:07.900]  We had to do it all over again.
[39:07.960 --> 39:10.520]  Probably another 30 minutes before we beat it again.
[39:10.760 --> 39:14.700]  That might have been the low point of Andrew's experience.
[39:14.700 --> 39:17.640]  And you can look forward to seeing that in May of 2025.
[39:19.300 --> 39:22.760]  That was so shocking. I thought it was a narrative thing.
[39:22.840 --> 39:27.760]  Like I thought I had went into a cut scene of like I was supposed to fall in and then you guys saved me.
[39:27.940 --> 39:30.240]  And then we just died and we had to do it all over again.
[39:30.860 --> 39:36.560]  The thing that broke me, the moment where I just I hit a wall is the last one we filmed.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.480]  We had to do a thing where we're in a desert with nothing but space.
[39:42.120 --> 39:52.820]  And these explosive enemies climb out of the sand below you and they have no legs.
[39:53.080 --> 39:55.060]  They don't have any way to shoot you.
[39:55.140 --> 39:56.280]  They have no real weapons.
[39:56.540 --> 40:00.480]  All they can do to hurt you is you kill them and they blow up next to you.
[40:00.620 --> 40:03.800]  And Gavin could not get through this sequence.
[40:04.220 --> 40:07.140]  He kept blowing up time and time again.
[40:07.140 --> 40:11.380]  And it just by the like 11th reset, I was done.
[40:11.500 --> 40:12.500]  You were just screaming.
[40:12.920 --> 40:14.760]  You went silent for like the last three.
[40:14.900 --> 40:16.980]  And then suddenly you're like, they don't have legs.
[40:17.180 --> 40:18.260]  They don't even have legs.
[40:18.480 --> 40:19.220]  What are you doing?
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.360]  But I think a lot of this is to blame on the fact that I'm still trying to get this
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.000]  achievement for getting a kill with every relic weapon.
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.040]  And I just picked up the relic version of the closest range weapon in the game.
[40:32.500 --> 40:34.300]  And I was determined to get a kill with it.
[40:34.900 --> 40:35.420]  But we're through.
[40:35.540 --> 40:36.220]  We passed it.
[40:37.060 --> 40:40.760]  I'd say probably like 70% of the way through this game.
[40:41.020 --> 40:45.560]  Eric seems to have posted a picture of a rabbit attacking iJustine or something.
[40:46.400 --> 40:49.320]  I sent this video to Andrew the other day.
[40:49.560 --> 40:52.360]  And I just said, this is Gavin when you mess up.
[40:52.500 --> 40:57.300]  And it's just it's this like Ukrainian jackrabbit that I started following
[40:57.300 --> 41:00.740]  that just beats these people up.
[41:00.820 --> 41:02.760]  It's so big.
[41:03.000 --> 41:03.760]  Is that their pet?
[41:03.760 --> 41:06.160]  Yes, it lives at their house.
[41:06.300 --> 41:08.220]  It is an evil little jack rabbit.
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.480]  It's so strong.
[41:09.580 --> 41:12.640]  And she just sits on the couch and it walks up to her and just goes
[41:14.220 --> 41:15.660]  and start's fuckin hitting her.
[41:15.780 --> 41:17.460]  And I was just like, oh this is Andrew and Gavin.
[41:20.320 --> 41:23.220]  Anyway, I only brought it up to tell the audience.
[41:23.420 --> 41:28.040]  If if you're looking for some classic Gavin and Andrew needling each other,
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.740]  take a take those videos for a spin, if you're ever bored, I think if and when they ever come out.
[41:33.740 --> 41:34.800]  Because I think they're pretty funny.
[41:35.340 --> 41:39.080]  What we are talking about maybe doing, Eric, is we're going to,
[41:39.220 --> 41:44.160]  when this eventually all comes out, it'll probably be like, I don't know,
[41:44.740 --> 41:47.860]  40 plus hours of gameplay over.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.080]  I don't even know how many parts.
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.020]  We're talking like 31 is the guess.
[41:51.220 --> 41:52.360]  I'm going to guess mid 20s.
[41:52.820 --> 41:56.080]  How funny it would be if we like put all of them together
[41:56.080 --> 41:57.960]  and release that as a singular gameplay.
[41:58.860 --> 42:00.940]  That's that is the moat we'll run out of.
[42:00.960 --> 42:01.900]  We don't we can't.
[42:01.900 --> 42:04.120]  We don't have enough space on Patreon.
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.560]  We have like maybe we do this like we have a finite amount of time.
[42:09.860 --> 42:11.460]  Like we can't just 31.
[42:11.660 --> 42:14.540]  Like imagine uploading a 31 hour video to Patreon.
[42:14.780 --> 42:17.360]  We already had to go. Hey, can we get more space?
[42:17.680 --> 42:20.780]  Well, 31 parts would probably be like 60 to 70 hours.
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.620]  Yeah. Oh, you know, speaking of a 31 hour video
[42:25.620 --> 42:28.880]  that actually gives reminds me of an idea I wanted to pitch you guys on.
[42:29.620 --> 42:33.920]  What do you think the longest podcast ever recorded is?
[42:34.200 --> 42:36.080]  And do you think it should be us?
[42:36.620 --> 42:39.500]  No. And we could be in the Guinness Book of World Records.
[42:40.060 --> 42:43.860]  No, no, that's not really like one marathon episode.
[42:43.860 --> 42:45.960]  We just go till we break the record.
[42:46.080 --> 42:48.620]  Now the record is like one hundred and fifty hours or something.
[42:48.680 --> 42:50.620]  One hundred and fifty three hour marathon.
[42:51.100 --> 42:52.560]  Who did it? Who did it?
[42:52.620 --> 42:54.340]  Who did it? Some Dutch podcast.
[42:54.760 --> 42:56.240]  Oh, we're better than the Dutch.
[42:56.340 --> 42:58.180]  We can do one hundred and fifty four hours.
[42:58.180 --> 42:59.820]  No, we can't beat the Dutch.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.120]  All right, man, you started with some so all right stuff for.
[43:03.580 --> 43:07.560]  I would say if you can get it to like one hundred and forty five hours,
[43:07.680 --> 43:09.880]  we can one hundred and fifty hours we can swoop in.
[43:10.380 --> 43:13.080]  I could do the first 30 hours by myself.
[43:13.080 --> 43:14.960]  But you guys got to help out at some point.
[43:15.580 --> 43:17.900]  We were getting quiet after like 90 minutes in gears.
[43:18.580 --> 43:19.660]  I well, that's different.
[43:19.760 --> 43:20.480]  That is different.
[43:20.940 --> 43:22.640]  You are getting fatigued by the game.
[43:22.640 --> 43:24.080]  You're running out of shit to talk about.
[43:24.220 --> 43:26.600]  You're yeah, you're focusing and trying to fuck.
[43:26.620 --> 43:27.120]  That's my point.
[43:28.100 --> 43:30.300]  No, for me, it's not running out of shit to talk about.
[43:30.440 --> 43:33.480]  It's that you're getting beaten down by the world that you're in.
[43:33.720 --> 43:35.920]  And you don't have that when we're podcasting.
[43:37.060 --> 43:41.860]  Yeah, you're not getting beat down by you like we are 90 minutes into a let's play.
[43:43.080 --> 43:45.700]  That's yeah, anyway, it seems long.
[43:45.740 --> 43:46.440]  I'm just telling that out there.
[43:46.520 --> 43:47.400]  Hundred fifty four hours.
[43:47.820 --> 43:48.280]  Break the record.
[43:48.400 --> 43:50.380]  Be in the Guinness Book till somebody breaks ours.
[43:50.500 --> 43:51.280]  I think we could do it.
[43:51.340 --> 43:55.140]  We'd be like the Dave Chappelle of of podcasting,
[43:55.140 --> 43:57.740]  not in terms of content, but just like he, I think, has the record
[43:57.740 --> 44:00.000]  for longest stand up, or at least he did for a while.
[44:00.620 --> 44:03.720]  It was him and Dane Cook were like going back and forth for a couple of years.
[44:04.420 --> 44:05.200]  Found out, do each other.
[44:05.380 --> 44:06.160]  Gear two heroes.
[44:09.420 --> 44:10.060]  We didn't.
[44:10.180 --> 44:12.740]  So we've been doing a lot of gears, but we also we played some zombies.
[44:13.000 --> 44:14.500]  Just that wasn't recorded.
[44:15.680 --> 44:20.520]  Eric, Gavin, Jeff, myself one evening booted up some Call of Duty zombies.
[44:20.820 --> 44:22.240]  Had so much fun.
[44:22.260 --> 44:23.200]  That is such a good mode.
[44:23.200 --> 44:25.800]  I haven't done that in such a long time where it's just like,
[44:25.860 --> 44:28.240]  yo, let's stay up till like one in the morning playing video games.
[44:28.480 --> 44:30.180]  It was so much fun.
[44:30.480 --> 44:32.840]  It was like Saturday night, maybe a Friday night.
[44:32.920 --> 44:35.120]  We did it like, yeah, till about one thirty in the morning.
[44:35.220 --> 44:37.680]  I think it's the first time I had fun playing zombies.
[44:37.880 --> 44:40.880]  I think historically I thought that mode was dog shit and I don't even like watching.
[44:41.120 --> 44:43.020]  Yeah, yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[44:43.620 --> 44:44.500]  It was so much fun.
[44:44.660 --> 44:45.880]  Eric, you had such a funny line.
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.380]  It was the night where it shifted.
[44:47.560 --> 44:48.400]  Time changed.
[44:48.440 --> 44:51.140]  And you're like, well, if we just keep playing, we'll get another hour.
[44:51.160 --> 44:51.680]  Yeah, it's great.
[44:51.680 --> 44:52.520]  It'll be fine.
[44:52.900 --> 44:53.940]  It'll be totally fine.
[44:54.200 --> 44:54.960]  You just get all that time back.
[44:55.420 --> 44:57.520]  Yeah, because all of a sudden, Gavin's like, this is my last one.
[44:57.600 --> 44:59.040]  It's like, why if we play for one more hour?
[44:59.380 --> 45:00.660]  It's like we didn't play at all.
[45:00.700 --> 45:02.480]  So it's fine to go to bed.
[45:03.680 --> 45:05.100]  It it's really cool.
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.700]  And then we've been like recording like you guys just recorded a zombies video.
[45:08.780 --> 45:12.600]  It's like an hour long trying to just get through like wave after wave.
[45:12.900 --> 45:14.540]  It's just such a fun mode.
[45:14.540 --> 45:17.680]  And it's so easy to like get into.
[45:17.900 --> 45:18.820]  It's unbelievable.
[45:19.140 --> 45:21.240]  It's the only game that lets you play it.
[45:21.240 --> 45:22.160]  It's fantastic.
[45:22.680 --> 45:27.180]  I think it's maybe the most dramatic shift from one video to the next
[45:27.180 --> 45:30.400]  where we recorded a different like general Call of Duty video
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.760]  where we played zombies and it's us just going, well, how does everything?
[45:34.960 --> 45:36.740]  What is happening? Well, how does this work?
[45:36.880 --> 45:38.480]  What are we doing? I'm lost.
[45:38.580 --> 45:39.440]  I don't know what's happening.
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.560]  We're getting destroyed to the video we recorded today of like, OK,
[45:43.560 --> 45:44.720]  we got to get the pack a punch going.
[45:44.920 --> 45:46.140]  We got to get the juice going.
[45:46.400 --> 45:47.840]  Got to make sure we have this. Gavin's got a wonder weapon.
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.260]  We're like, yeah, we're fucking yeah.
[45:49.580 --> 45:50.640]  Yeah, we're so locked in.
[45:50.640 --> 45:52.800]  Maybe we should put those videos out back to back.
[45:53.480 --> 45:53.900]  It'd be fun.
[45:57.180 --> 45:59.780]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.

[46:49.510 --> 46:51.450]  Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[46:52.390 --> 46:54.150]  I have a question about theft.
[46:54.990 --> 46:57.770]  OK, when is stealing, stealing?
[46:58.450 --> 47:01.130]  Like, can I, as long as I buy everything
[47:01.130 --> 47:04.050]  on the way out of the store, I haven't stolen anything, right?
[47:05.890 --> 47:07.430]  Yeah, I what?
[47:07.930 --> 47:11.230]  Like if like if I if I'm like walking around the store,
[47:11.350 --> 47:13.270]  I didn't get a basket, I didn't bring a bag.
[47:14.050 --> 47:17.010]  Can I just fill my pockets with stuff and then take it all out
[47:17.010 --> 47:21.690]  and buy it on the way out, or will I get pulled into a room for shoplifting?
[47:22.290 --> 47:25.970]  No, they can't arrest you for shoplifting until you shoplift.
[47:26.630 --> 47:29.890]  So if you were to like to fill your pockets with stuff
[47:29.890 --> 47:33.290]  and then walk up to the cash register and start pulling shit out of your pockets
[47:33.290 --> 47:34.710]  in front of her, I think you'd be fine.
[47:34.950 --> 47:39.690]  See, the scenario where it gets maybe a little bit sketchy is if let's say
[47:39.690 --> 47:43.770]  you're super dehydrated and you just need something to drink to drink,
[47:43.850 --> 47:46.530]  like grab a bottle and drink in the store.
[47:46.770 --> 47:47.610]  Do you ever do that?
[47:47.710 --> 47:49.790]  The party that all the time I do that all the time.
[47:49.790 --> 47:52.030]  Oh, dude, it feels like stealing.
[47:52.170 --> 47:54.070]  It gives me the same thrill as shoplifting.
[47:54.350 --> 47:56.470]  Yeah, it really it's all.
[47:56.610 --> 47:58.190]  Andrew, you got to try it.
[47:58.310 --> 47:59.570]  It is. I don't need that.
[47:59.650 --> 48:00.670]  I find that stressful.
[48:01.170 --> 48:03.690]  No, dude, you feel like a little bad boy, but you're not.
[48:03.910 --> 48:04.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:04.870 --> 48:05.950]  Because you're going to pay for it.
[48:05.970 --> 48:07.110]  You're going to pay for that prime.
[48:07.250 --> 48:08.070]  And I know you're drinking prime.
[48:08.190 --> 48:10.870]  But what if that what if that coincides with the one time you forgot your wallet?
[48:12.290 --> 48:12.790]  Apple Pay.
[48:13.550 --> 48:14.310]  Oh, you forgot.
[48:15.090 --> 48:16.710]  I used it. Yes, I used it yesterday.
[48:17.090 --> 48:18.150]  I went to a coffee shop.
[48:18.270 --> 48:19.650]  I was I went for a walk yesterday.
[48:19.650 --> 48:21.550]  I walked to a coffee shop, realized that I know my wallet on me.
[48:21.590 --> 48:22.650]  It was like, oh, I just ordered.
[48:22.750 --> 48:24.230]  Oh, right. Apple Pay. It's twenty twenty four.
[48:25.250 --> 48:25.610]  Duh.
[48:25.730 --> 48:29.770]  H-E-B just got Apple Pay on the around the 10th anniversary of Apple Pay.
[48:30.330 --> 48:31.330]  And tapped to pay.
[48:31.750 --> 48:32.710]  Yep. Yep.
[48:32.990 --> 48:36.230]  So like I say, drink your drink in the middle of the store.
[48:36.650 --> 48:40.550]  I think that putting stuff in your pockets and taking it to the front is insane.
[48:41.770 --> 48:45.350]  But I would love to see you do it
[48:45.350 --> 48:48.710]  from a distance where you don't interact with me whatsoever.
[48:48.710 --> 48:51.250]  I think, though, it becomes funny depending on the item.
[48:51.630 --> 48:54.770]  Like if you have big pockets and you're just putting like a thing,
[48:54.850 --> 48:59.330]  like a like a wrapped up steak, like a package of steaks in your pocket.
[49:00.790 --> 49:02.730]  That's this is this is good.
[49:02.810 --> 49:07.130]  So if you get like some like Janko jeans, like just real big pocket jeans.
[49:08.330 --> 49:09.870]  I love this idea.
[49:10.050 --> 49:12.970]  I think you just pull out like here's a block of cheese.
[49:13.350 --> 49:15.230]  And I think that's awesome.
[49:15.850 --> 49:17.950]  Deli meats coming out of your pocket.
[49:18.500 --> 49:20.590]  Yeah, that's it's not stealing.
[49:21.350 --> 49:22.190]  It's just weird.
[49:23.830 --> 49:25.670]  It's just different.
[49:26.050 --> 49:28.430]  That's it's weird doing stuff that people think is a crime, though.
[49:28.610 --> 49:31.230]  It reminds me of the the scene in the Mr.
[49:31.350 --> 49:34.430]  Bean movie where he pretends to have a gun in the airport.
[49:36.950 --> 49:38.290]  But it's just his hand.
[49:42.560 --> 49:43.400]  That's great.
[49:43.920 --> 49:45.180]  And yeah, it's a good bit.
[49:46.640 --> 49:48.660]  He gets chased all through the airport.
[49:48.660 --> 49:52.560]  Oh, what made you think of that?
[49:52.620 --> 49:53.340]  It was it was a Mr.
[49:53.380 --> 49:55.060]  Bean. Was that the start of that thought?
[49:55.520 --> 49:56.500]  No, I was just in the store.
[49:56.580 --> 50:00.460]  I was like, I wish I could use my pockets right now without drawing attention.
[50:01.800 --> 50:02.420]  You could.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.020]  Well, I know I know the technical.
[50:04.380 --> 50:07.160]  Yeah, I don't want to go through it.
[50:07.560 --> 50:08.060]  No, that's fair.
[50:08.480 --> 50:10.380]  If there's a security guard who just starts following me
[50:10.380 --> 50:13.020]  and then they they're about to jump on me, I'm just like, I'm going to pay for it.
[50:13.020 --> 50:15.080]  But then they're going to wonder, like, is he only paying for it?
[50:15.080 --> 50:17.240]  Because we're watching you guys.
[50:17.240 --> 50:21.780]  Have you guys seen those TikToks of those dudes that supposedly Walmart has these
[50:21.780 --> 50:25.000]  like, I don't know if this is true, but there's a whole lane of TikTok
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.640]  where people will try to spot them, people that will hang out in the parking lot
[50:29.640 --> 50:33.560]  that are hired by Walmart to follow you in to see if you're shoplifting or not.
[50:33.620 --> 50:35.740]  And they look like they're shopping like secret shoppers,
[50:35.800 --> 50:39.700]  but they're really just there to watch other like specific shoppers
[50:39.700 --> 50:41.540]  to see if they're shoplifting.
[50:41.720 --> 50:44.060]  It would be so cool to deploy two of those on each other.
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.740]  Yeah. Two people pretending to shop.
[50:50.640 --> 50:51.620]  That's so funny.
[50:52.780 --> 50:54.080]  See who breaks first.
[50:55.420 --> 50:57.200]  So how does Apple pay work?
[50:57.980 --> 50:59.100]  How do I like?
[50:59.220 --> 51:00.800]  Because there's Google Pay, too, right?
[51:01.440 --> 51:03.500]  Probably the exact same way Google Pay works.
[51:03.760 --> 51:06.400]  Well, you know, the like the contactless cards.
[51:07.560 --> 51:08.600]  Contactless cards.
[51:08.880 --> 51:11.200]  The credit cards and debit cards where you just tap.
[51:11.380 --> 51:12.560]  Yeah, the tap. Yeah.
[51:12.560 --> 51:13.440]  It's that.
[51:13.900 --> 51:16.760]  But your phone like decides which card it uses.
[51:17.260 --> 51:19.500]  OK, so it's like if you're using the store.
[51:20.880 --> 51:22.200]  I wonder if I have it then.
[51:22.660 --> 51:25.920]  If I have my card, if my card is saved onto my phone,
[51:25.960 --> 51:27.680]  can I just tap with my phone?
[51:28.160 --> 51:29.380]  If your phone does tap to pay?
[51:29.900 --> 51:31.040]  Yeah. Interesting.
[51:31.360 --> 51:32.820]  OK. You never tried it?
[51:33.060 --> 51:36.440]  Never tried it because I just it's like one of those things where I could just tap.
[51:36.880 --> 51:39.420]  Does your phone have soy oil in it by any chance?
[51:40.560 --> 51:41.760]  Not that I've found yet.
[51:41.760 --> 51:43.900]  I guess I think that's a required component.
[51:44.140 --> 51:45.940]  Yeah. Oh, it's out to pay.
[51:46.020 --> 51:49.660]  I'm pretty sure I think I think you should leave your cards
[51:49.660 --> 51:52.460]  and wallet and everything at home and just go try to buy something
[51:52.460 --> 51:53.860]  and see if your phone will work with it.
[51:54.140 --> 51:54.800]  Just see what happens.
[51:55.200 --> 51:56.520]  But you could only buy off the end caps.
[51:56.780 --> 51:58.900]  Yeah, see, now we're talking.
[51:59.020 --> 52:00.600]  This is going to put everything in your pocket.
[52:01.360 --> 52:04.760]  I had a huge reveal recently, and this was just
[52:04.760 --> 52:08.120]  last time I tried to do this, my phone was way out of date.
[52:08.760 --> 52:13.080]  I'm I'm somebody who used like a flip phone for a long time
[52:13.080 --> 52:14.040]  beyond when I should have.
[52:14.360 --> 52:15.920]  And then the next one I got was very old.
[52:16.580 --> 52:20.060]  Last time I did this, there wasn't built in technology
[52:20.060 --> 52:23.840]  to scan a QR code from going through the photo thing.
[52:24.260 --> 52:27.980]  So I've always downloaded a QR code scanning app.
[52:28.380 --> 52:32.600]  And I just realized that I can just use the camera app
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.600]  that is part of the soy phone.
[52:34.820 --> 52:35.800]  And that has been nice.
[52:36.420 --> 52:38.740]  Not having to have a whole other app for a thing.
[52:39.340 --> 52:43.120]  I think it'd be fun to go into a restaurant and copy all the QR codes
[52:43.120 --> 52:45.940]  on the tables and then print them and put them in a different restaurant.
[52:54.500 --> 52:57.360]  I don't think I've seen QR code technology in a restaurant.
[52:57.760 --> 52:59.720]  Oh, really? You've never seen a menu on the table?
[52:59.840 --> 53:03.340]  In Austin, I actually did an episode of Saul Wright about QR codes
[53:03.340 --> 53:04.900]  because they're so everywhere in Austin.
[53:05.860 --> 53:10.020]  In Austin, I'd say there's probably a 50-50 shot your menu is going to be a QR code
[53:10.020 --> 53:12.240]  or they'll have a QR option as a menu.
[53:13.060 --> 53:13.500]  Interesting.
[53:14.600 --> 53:16.560]  It's just like pull up the menu for Chili's.
[53:18.460 --> 53:22.600]  Dude, if I went to a menu and someone did a QR code mix them up on me,
[53:22.680 --> 53:24.200]  I would be furious.
[53:24.780 --> 53:27.620]  I already hate the QR code menu thing.
[53:27.860 --> 53:30.720]  Like that is that's probably like my most like boomer opinion
[53:30.720 --> 53:32.800]  is that I'm just over the QR code thing.
[53:32.800 --> 53:38.840]  Uh, dude, if I went to Daynana, I scanned the fucking QR code.
[53:38.880 --> 53:40.180]  It's like, yo, check it out, Applebee's.
[53:40.280 --> 53:42.420]  I would be so mad. I would be so mad.
[53:42.420 --> 53:45.260]  I just feel like it's so easy to get in between.
[53:45.680 --> 53:49.080]  I feel like you could so easily set up a fake site with a fake menu
[53:49.080 --> 53:50.640]  and a fake credit card thing.
[53:50.880 --> 53:52.400]  I'm always so nervous to use them.
[53:52.480 --> 53:56.140]  I'm like, what if this is someone's secret lookalike menu?
[53:56.520 --> 53:57.560]  It actually does happen.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.800]  And that is something you have to watch out for.
[54:00.800 --> 54:04.420]  It's like the equivalent of those things on the front of the pin,
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.700]  the ATM pin code things that like take your information.
[54:07.980 --> 54:10.280]  Oh, yeah. The scrapers or whatever.
[54:10.800 --> 54:14.840]  It's so funny you say you say Daynana, Eric, because that was where I had the
[54:14.840 --> 54:18.560]  like, that's where I had the whole idea to do the So All Right episode about QR codes
[54:18.560 --> 54:21.360]  because I was sitting there scanning that fucking QR code and thinking,
[54:21.540 --> 54:24.360]  when did this become the way we do stuff?
[54:24.740 --> 54:27.160]  Like there was a most of my life QR codes didn't exist.
[54:27.220 --> 54:29.480]  And now they're just fucking everywhere all the time.
[54:30.020 --> 54:31.980]  And they're kind of an old technology at this point.
[54:32.420 --> 54:37.280]  Yeah, I just I hate sitting down with my parents at a restaurant
[54:37.280 --> 54:42.080]  if they come into town and then now we're all looking at our phones
[54:42.080 --> 54:44.460]  and it's like, dude, this sucks shit.
[54:44.680 --> 54:47.300]  I hate it so much.
[54:47.660 --> 54:49.160]  Like, it's worse than everyone looking at a menu.
[54:49.880 --> 54:54.660]  I yeah, yeah, yeah, because it because it doesn't just become
[54:54.660 --> 54:56.040]  we're just looking at the menu.
[54:56.560 --> 54:59.280]  Now I have to have my phone on and open
[54:59.280 --> 55:04.380]  so when they come back, I can order the thing right off of my phone menu.
[55:04.640 --> 55:06.920]  And then because if my phone closes, oh, hang on.
[55:06.980 --> 55:08.900]  Oh, I got to get a swipe up.
[55:09.320 --> 55:11.340]  It's too it. I hate it. Just give me the menu.
[55:11.600 --> 55:12.720]  Just I just want the menu.
[55:13.140 --> 55:15.840]  Gavin, you gave me a great idea for a piece of supplemental we could do
[55:15.840 --> 55:18.240]  or just a fun thing to do on a weekend.
[55:18.540 --> 55:21.740]  What if we collect the QR codes from every restaurant in Austin
[55:21.740 --> 55:24.920]  and then we put them in a hat and we play QR code roulette?
[55:25.020 --> 55:26.060]  And that's what we have to eat.
[55:26.520 --> 55:28.460]  Dude, that's a great idea.
[55:28.460 --> 55:30.160]  That is so good.
[55:30.500 --> 55:31.480]  It's a great idea, right?
[55:31.540 --> 55:33.860]  You just get 10 QR codes and throw them in a hat.
[55:33.980 --> 55:35.940]  And that's how you figure out that's what dinner is.
[55:36.200 --> 55:39.140]  And maybe there's an 11th QR code that just takes you to the wheel.
[55:40.580 --> 55:42.540]  Oh, yes, yes.
[55:43.120 --> 55:46.520]  And then the other wheel is the other half of the car.
[55:46.820 --> 55:48.600]  Go back to the first wheel.
[55:48.900 --> 55:50.320]  Nick picks breakfast.
[55:51.020 --> 55:54.080]  Do we should it be a rule that anytime we have options
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.760]  more than like five options to pick in a thing, one of like the six option
[55:57.760 --> 56:00.740]  has to be wheel? Yeah, I think I think I think it should.
[56:00.940 --> 56:02.240]  I think the wheel has to. Yeah.
[56:02.540 --> 56:06.560]  I don't like it, but I do think that that is what needs to happen.
[56:06.740 --> 56:10.680]  Yes. One of the QR codes is this takes you to a JPEG of a gun.
[56:12.560 --> 56:13.880]  Oh, Monopoly style.
[56:14.160 --> 56:15.660]  Yeah, let's play Monopoly.
[56:17.980 --> 56:21.000]  I'm annoyed at phones because they're they're so smart,
[56:21.080 --> 56:24.460]  but it's just smart, like against us, like a phone.
[56:24.460 --> 56:28.000]  A phone knows my stupid face, right?
[56:28.100 --> 56:32.220]  It's looking at my face like it might know to play an alarm or a ringer
[56:32.220 --> 56:34.860]  very quietly if I'm looking at it as Andrew dealt with.
[56:35.400 --> 56:40.740]  But why does it show my notifications to someone else if I'm showing them a video?
[56:42.600 --> 56:44.100]  Oh, I can see the two faces.
[56:44.580 --> 56:46.760]  It can't just sit and see like, oh, I'm looking at a different face.
[56:46.840 --> 56:48.520]  How about do not disturb for the next minute?
[56:49.140 --> 56:51.360]  That's interesting. Yeah. Be a cool feature.
[56:51.540 --> 56:53.860]  I never even considered that because I'm always like accidentally,
[56:53.860 --> 56:55.240]  you know, I'm always like, hey, look at this video.
[56:55.300 --> 56:57.340]  And then like, it's like, oh, someone commented this on Instagram.
[56:57.480 --> 56:59.420]  And then I go to swipe it away and I accidentally press it.
[56:59.620 --> 57:01.440]  Pulls me to Instagram. Like I found.
[57:03.960 --> 57:05.440]  Yeah, that's annoying. That kind of shit.
[57:07.420 --> 57:07.940]  I you know what?
[57:07.940 --> 57:12.880]  That is a problem that like I've it has never reached a level of problem
[57:12.880 --> 57:15.760]  that in my brain has felt like I need to fix this.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.240]  But I think that's a great idea.
[57:17.800 --> 57:19.260]  I feel like the tech is already there.
[57:19.260 --> 57:22.160]  Like you said, I don't know what would prevent that.
[57:22.680 --> 57:24.680]  Only show my face, my notifications.
[57:25.980 --> 57:28.500]  Yeah. Yeah. I think that works.
[57:29.120 --> 57:32.340]  Yeah. Right. Hey, I for the for the record,
[57:32.560 --> 57:35.360]  I owe Gavin and Andrew each a vinyl.
[57:35.860 --> 57:36.460]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[57:36.460 --> 57:40.020]  That's where the vinyl count for some Gears of War bullshit.
[57:40.160 --> 57:42.040]  Gears is great for my vinyl collection.
[57:42.320 --> 57:43.520]  It's where it started.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.000]  I've gotten two from it.
[57:45.560 --> 57:48.320]  You know, when I did this whole vinyl idea, I thought it would turn into
[57:48.320 --> 57:51.580]  some kind of content other than me just buying records for you guys.
[57:51.580 --> 57:53.900]  And then us never talking about it on camera ever.
[57:54.300 --> 57:56.620]  There was. You guys need to release.
[57:56.740 --> 57:59.540]  You and Eric went to the store and like picked up vinyls and stuff.
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.740]  I'd love to see. Oh, yeah, we did that.
[58:01.880 --> 58:04.620]  You guys could also listen to the vinyls and talk about them
[58:04.620 --> 58:07.720]  or like pick a song you like out of each vinyl or I don't know.
[58:07.760 --> 58:11.260]  That was sort of, I think, the idea for a supplemental around it.
[58:11.400 --> 58:14.400]  But we just we need to get to a point where we all have enough vinyls.
[58:14.500 --> 58:15.860]  Like we all at least probably need.
[58:16.080 --> 58:17.140]  So you're waiting on me?
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.780]  I guess. Yeah. Yeah.
[58:18.880 --> 58:21.120]  Yeah. You can just buy us all a bunch of records, man.
[58:21.120 --> 58:21.920]  That would be really cool.
[58:21.940 --> 58:26.340]  How many how many vinyls does ever has everyone collected from me so far?
[58:26.440 --> 58:26.980]  What's the one?
[58:27.940 --> 58:32.680]  One for Gavin, zero for Nick, zero for Eric.
[58:32.720 --> 58:33.720]  How many do you have, Gavin?
[58:34.100 --> 58:34.780]  From you? Three.
[58:35.460 --> 58:37.120]  Jesus, you better have four, I guess.
[58:37.320 --> 58:38.140]  OK, I got a whole lot.
[58:38.280 --> 58:41.720]  So I got like a sacks, blogs or bogs or whatever you call it.
[58:41.720 --> 58:42.920]  What is it? Yeah, I don't know.
[58:43.700 --> 58:44.300]  I'm ready.
[58:45.080 --> 58:46.360]  I don't need any other ones.
[58:46.380 --> 58:48.680]  I just figured it like once, like three of us had one,
[58:48.740 --> 58:49.760]  then they would make more sense.
[58:49.760 --> 58:52.800]  All right. Well, I'll have to tell you what.
[58:52.900 --> 58:58.660]  I'll tell you what. Pick a page between 30 and 900.
[58:59.560 --> 59:02.060]  Let's do 33.
[59:02.680 --> 59:04.700]  Fuck. OK, 33.
[59:12.360 --> 59:13.980]  Oh, hold on.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.480]  I'm trying to find anything interesting.
[59:16.780 --> 59:20.740]  Who won back to back WNBA championships?
[59:22.560 --> 59:25.380]  Not this year, but the two previous years.
[59:25.800 --> 59:27.600]  This year, it was New York Liberty.
[59:27.760 --> 59:29.380]  Who won last year and the year before?
[59:32.170 --> 59:33.490]  Is this just for Andrew?
[59:33.910 --> 59:34.510]  It's for anybody.
[59:35.150 --> 59:37.550]  Aces? Is it the Vegas one?
[59:37.590 --> 59:38.870]  I was going to say the Vegas team.
[59:39.530 --> 59:40.810]  Eric wins a vinyl.
[59:41.230 --> 59:42.110]  I won a vinyl!
[59:43.390 --> 59:44.250]  There you go. All right.
[59:44.390 --> 59:46.190]  Asia Wilson and the Las Vegas Aces.
[59:46.370 --> 59:46.550]  Wow.
[59:46.550 --> 59:48.110]  Eric is on the vinyl board.
[59:48.230 --> 59:49.450]  Let me write that. I'm on the vinyl board.
[59:49.810 --> 59:51.130]  OK, yeah.
[59:51.890 --> 59:52.550]  Good for you, Eric.
[59:52.990 --> 59:54.070]  Thanks, man. Can't wait.
[59:54.310 --> 59:57.970]  Gavin, Andrew and Eric. A vinyl.
[59:59.170 --> 01:00:03.310]  You ever think about how certain names are like a name and also a thing?
[01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.190]  Like a Derek? Shut up.
[01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:11.750]  You can't. You can't do callbacks to shit
[01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.690]  that's not going to come out for seven years.
[01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:16.090]  No, it's just what I thought it was.
[01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.570]  What's going on now?
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:19.290]  I just it's an observation I had.
[01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.350]  When you get to episode 10 of our Gears of War, let's play.
[01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.630]  It'll all make sense.
[01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:26.430]  That was it.
[01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.490]  Andrew, you know, you know, you never really considered it,
[01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:32.670]  but I like where you're going.
[01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.670]  What examples do you have?
[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.470]  You know, like an oil Derek and the name Derek.
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.490]  Like that confusing.
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.990]  If someone's like, oh, Derek.
[01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.990]  And it's like, oh, it's me. It's not me.
[01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:44.130]  Matt, anything else?
[01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:45.590]  Oh, yeah. Oh, Matt. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:46.530]  Matt's a good one.
[01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.190]  Mostly just Derek and oil Derek, though, if we can focus on that.
[01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.470]  That's the Derek and oil Derek.
[01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:52.830]  It's pretty crazy. Wow.
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.630]  Is there is there a reason we're focusing on that?
[01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:57.650]  No, it's just an observation.
[01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.090]  I think it's a good starting point.
[01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:01.570]  That's a that's a I'll tell you the reason.
[01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:04.270]  That's Andrew's own weasel ish behavior.
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:05.370]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.010]  I had a feeling that it was because Gavin is fucking silent.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.090]  Look, Andrew is Weasley back.
[01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.450]  It was it was back and forth.
[01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:13.770]  I'm not taking all the blame.
[01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:17.950]  That was where Andrew beat the ever loving psychic shit out of Gavin.
[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.370]  Was us doing that, recreating a conversation
[01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.450]  every time we had to reload a check. Oh, wow.
[01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:29.150]  Over and over and over again.
[01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:33.650]  Andrew, should we should we come up with a rabbit slash weasel safe word?
[01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:35.310]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.410]  The weasel versus the rabbit.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:38.930]  I like this. I like it.
[01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.790]  I like a yeah, rabbit weasel safe word.
[01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:45.170]  Yeah, like when we've what would be will be a good safe word for rabbit weasel
[01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:49.410]  on the needle and just hit a point where it's about to not be a bit, I guess.
[01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:49.850]  I don't know.
[01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:53.890]  I mean, I haven't got close to my limit, but I don't know.
[01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.030]  No, I don't. I haven't either.
[01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.670]  I got like real. Yeah, that's good.
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.390]  We don't have to be real. No, no.
[01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:04.250]  I don't think I've ever had like a real content.
[01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:11.050]  And. I had one with Nick recently in the Left 4 Dead 2 video.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.470]  That was fun. Oh, what? Really?
[01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:16.850]  Because I kept I was I like to lead the pack, Left 4 Dead 2,
[01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:20.390]  and I was trying real I felt like I was playing real well,
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.890]  but I was getting shit on. Did you say lead the pack or leave the pack?
[01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:27.810]  Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.
[01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:33.530]  But I was I felt like I was doing so well in that video.
[01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:39.410]  And I was really carrying the team, but I wasn't like gloating about it.
[01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:40.950]  I was just doing my job.
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:44.090]  I was trying to do my best and everything that went wrong.
[01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:46.810]  It was my fault. I was getting dogpiled on.
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.070]  No offense, but to carry the team, that would imply we're on your back.
[01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.670]  We were still at the start of the level.
[01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.850]  You left us three miles away.
[01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.390]  This is a fake narrative.
[01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.950]  I listen. I like to lead the pack.
[01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:01.710]  I like to lead.
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.090]  And there are times, OK, this is what this is what would happen.
[01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:08.890]  We'll be in the middle of a road and that game is all about corners.
[01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:11.790]  So I need to move somewhere to get to a corner.
[01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.550]  So I would like run across the street because it's like I'm going to get hit.
[01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:18.690]  If I just stand in the middle of the street, I got to move to get to cover.
[01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:22.010]  And then it would be like, oh, Andrew's just written up ahead again.
[01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:24.050]  It's like I have to I have to go somewhere.
[01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:24.650]  I have to move.
[01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:26.770]  What corner?
[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:30.890]  What corner were you hitting when you slam the safe door in Nick's face?
[01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:31.810]  Well, that was for the team.
[01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.170]  That was that was unrelated to the thing.
[01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.230]  Obviously, we do progress when you're the only one that makes it to the safe room,
[01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:38.850]  but we lose all our shit.
[01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.310]  Then you get all your shit back in the safe room.
[01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.590]  There are guns, there's medpacks, there's some.
[01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.690]  There's a lot of good stuff in there.
[01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:49.470]  Anyway, you guys were like, oh, you're not communicating.
[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:50.610]  You're not communicating when you go ahead.
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.550]  And I communicated that I was going up to get get Jeff.
[01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:57.490]  And then Nick was like, oh, Andrew running ahead without communicating again.
[01:03:57.490 --> 01:04:00.570]  When I did do it and I gave a Nick, go fuck yourself.
[01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.250]  In a way that was like, I was I was done.
[01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:04.390]  I was over it.
[01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:06.110]  I like that it was Nick that was done.
[01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:09.250]  I will say communication is important to Andrew.
[01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:13.430]  He felt like Gavin wasn't communicating well enough in a boss fight yesterday.
[01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.730]  And he was that was pretty salty, too.
[01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:19.190]  Yeah, well, we should wait for this to come out before describing everything
[01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.670]  that's happened. Jesus Christ, I know we're insufferable.
[01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:22.630]  It's so bad.
[01:04:22.810 --> 01:04:26.710]  Oh, by the way, I finally recovered my Left 4 Dead 2 part two footage.
[01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.390]  Oh, nice. So, hey, did you upload that
[01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:33.050]  GTA audio that you needed to?
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.530]  Yep. Awesome.
[01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.730]  But with the GTA, that hasn't come out yet.
[01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:38.250]  So that's actually still still useful.
[01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:41.210]  But it's part of GTA month, which we're currently in.
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:42.630]  Yep. No Nick November.
[01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:44.010]  No Nick November.
[01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:49.390]  An additional Let's Play video of us doing a heist every week this month.
[01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:52.250]  On Thursday, I believe every Thursday.
[01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:55.570]  In addition to that, it is also Gerpal November.
[01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:56.450]  That's true.
[01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.810]  Gerpal Fridays coming up.
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.010]  What day is that specifically?
[01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:03.390]  That'll be November 22nd at noon central.
[01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:07.250]  I'm thinking that we and we sort of committed to this a while ago.
[01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:11.250]  We talked about doing a Mario party on that day
[01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:16.230]  to celebrate for for that GERP Friday on the 22nd.
[01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.490]  So I like that a lot.
[01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:18.770]  I forgot to feel pretty good about it.
[01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.250]  I like that idea as well.
[01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:21.350]  November 22nd.
[01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:24.710]  I think it'll just just be the GERPLER and the regulation shirt,
[01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.710]  I believe, is still in the store.
[01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.530]  You can probably buy that right now if you wanted to.
[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.050]  You can.
[01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:33.010]  But I think maybe we'll have another shirt or two as well.
[01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:34.370]  But I don't think so.
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:35.350]  I bought a new dock.
[01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:37.310]  You bought a new dock?
[01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.110]  Yeah, I bought a new dock.
[01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:41.210]  I bought a...
[01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.330]  You think the dock was the problem?
[01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.990]  I was using a third party dock, so I could have heard.
[01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.770]  Oh, now it's now it's all coming out.
[01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:51.370]  Yeah. Huh.
[01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.410]  Yeah. Yeah. Now.
[01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:53.870]  Yeah, it came out.
[01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.410]  OK. Yeah.
[01:05:56.210 --> 01:06:00.170]  I lost my dock a long time when I moved to this place, I lost my dock.
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:02.850]  And so I. Yeah.
[01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:05.850]  Yeah, I've been using a third party one.
[01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:07.170]  How much is the dock?
[01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:09.190]  The one I bought, the new one?
[01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:15.110]  Yeah, it's it's the OLED dock, and I got it on sale at Best Buy.
[01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.850]  Oh, sweet. That's that's the one that has the Ethernet.
[01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.310]  Yes. Yeah, the one I made sure.
[01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.550]  OK, so did my third party one.
[01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:25.670]  But it just I I don't want another issue of what happened before,
[01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.190]  so I'm just covering the bases.
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.790]  So you're saying your switch battery is good, is fine.
[01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:33.050]  No, my switch battery also sucks.
[01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:36.150]  But I think I was people were saying
[01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:40.110]  that like that dock has like a faster charge or something.
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:40.690]  I don't know.
[01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.690]  I don't even know what PoE is.
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:44.190]  I'm just I heard it's better.
[01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.930]  So I bought a prisoner of elders. Yeah.
[01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:48.390]  Oh, fuck. Yeah, you're right. Never mind.
[01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.850]  I don't even remember what you would get for beating the prisoner of elders,
[01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:56.030]  but it was it was important at the time.
[01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.750]  That's crazy to think about, like how important destiny was
[01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.670]  to me at one point and how not involved with it, I am now.
[01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:08.030]  We should record an attempt of us trying to beat the nightfall
[01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:10.230]  so you can get that final piece of grimoire, whatever.
[01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:12.810]  Yeah. Yeah. One exotic gun.
[01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.790]  We should do that.
[01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:16.430]  I saw somebody on my friend's list was playing Destiny the other day,
[01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:19.550]  and I hadn't thought about them or the game, I realize, in like eight years.
[01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:22.370]  Destiny one. I think they were playing Destiny one.
[01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.330]  Yeah, maybe crazy.
[01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.690]  Man, it runs like such anus.
[01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.370]  I can't believe we were fine with it.
[01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.950]  I remember really liking it when it came out.
[01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:32.070]  So it's so weird.
[01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:35.410]  That game left such an impression on me for a period of time.
[01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:39.490]  And then when we walked away from it, I just completely forgot about it.
[01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.610]  Yeah. You know, wild.
[01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:43.070]  Didn't stick with me.
[01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.410]  Now, what a fun episode.
[01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:46.250]  I was chill.
[01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:48.650]  I was a really feel like we covered a lot.
[01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:52.030]  Probably got to cut about 30 minutes of us talking about Gears of War episodes
[01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:53.430]  that aren't going to come out for a year out.
[01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.170]  I think it's good tease.
[01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:57.490]  Good tease.
[01:07:57.850 --> 01:08:00.870]  People will forget that they heard that by the time the videos come out.
[01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:01.310]  So it's fine.
[01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:03.610]  Do you see any Dobermans?
[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:04.570]  I saw one.
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:05.810]  Zero Dobermans still.
[01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:09.410]  I haven't seen a Doberman since you started the Doberman lookout.
[01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.570]  Dude, you got to look.
[01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:13.470]  Also, if anybody sees a Delaware license plate,
[01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.330]  it's the last one we need on our 50 states.
[01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:16.710]  We're racing Bernie and Vanessa right now.
[01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:20.310]  We're ahead, but I can't fucking find a Delaware license plate.
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.870]  I'll let you know if I see one.
[01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.410]  I don't think I've ever seen one, but if I do, it won't count.
[01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:29.190]  But you know, what's the rarest license plate to see in the US?
[01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:34.030]  North Korea, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, probably.
[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.510]  Alaska, Hawaii are pretty rough.
[01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.990]  Rhode Island, North Dakota.
[01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:42.310]  You don't see a lot of West Virginia.
[01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:44.690]  You don't see a lot of New Hampshire.
[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.450]  Maine. I think that's maybe just because of where we're at, right?
[01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:50.570]  Yeah, probably.
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.370]  Oh, you mean in Maine, they'd be much more common?
[01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:54.830]  Yeah, just a little bit more.
[01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:58.730]  You probably don't see as many Texas license plates in Maine as you do down here.
[01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.990]  I think I think it might be neck and neck.
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:04.790]  Do you guys remember tube TVs?
[01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:09.930]  Yeah. Like before, before we had LEDs and Wal-Mart TVs, flat screens.
[01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:11.970]  What do you think?
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:18.190]  I wonder what the very best last tube TV was.
[01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.670]  Like right before flat screens came out and we made the switch,
[01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:23.490]  there must have been a really good one, right?
[01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:25.010]  Or like the top of the line one.
[01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:26.710]  You think anybody still uses those?
[01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.150]  Maybe like a really nice Bang & Olufsen or something?
[01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:34.410]  Yeah, I think about tube TVs a lot because it is still very prevalent
[01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:35.790]  in the retro gaming scene.
[01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.610]  Yeah, big time. Oh, really?
[01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:40.390]  Yeah, they're they're like kind of expensive.
[01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:42.970]  Like you can find them or whatever, but sometimes you run into them
[01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.370]  and you're like, why is this so expensive?
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.510]  And it is for that reason, like the retro gaming stuff.
[01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:53.590]  I feel like England still feels the effects of CRT TVs
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.590]  because it used to be that those were just in the corner of a room,
[01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:59.610]  like you would point all the furniture into a corner with the TV
[01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:01.030]  on some sort of corner unit.
[01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:04.710]  But then for some reason, every house I go to in England
[01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:08.690]  has a big flat screen still in the corner of the room
[01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:11.710]  and not on the wall because it's like fireplaces and shit.
[01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.790]  So I feel like the England living room is still very corner focused.
[01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:17.830]  That's my observation of the week.
[01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.970]  I wonder if that'll be if that'll disappear after a generation or so.
[01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:24.930]  Well, yeah, and especially as as the TVs get bigger,
[01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:28.990]  they get closer to the middle of the room because it's a corner.
[01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:33.750]  My issue with flat screens is where I think we all went wrong
[01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:39.170]  as a society with TV technology is we embraced like it
[01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.630]  looking like a picture frame and trying to be cool.
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:46.950]  I miss the dumb ass CRT TVs that just look like insane things.
[01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:50.430]  Have you ever seen the Lightning McQueen CRT TV?
[01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:52.770]  And there's so many variations like this.
[01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:57.370]  There's so many dumb fucking TVs that we just don't make anymore
[01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:58.430]  that are awesome.
[01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.030]  Cool.
[01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:03.470]  VTV VCR combos were the fucking coolest, man. Awesome.
[01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.670]  Yeah, that's like lids and shit and like flaps.
[01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:11.630]  I did look into it recently to see if there is any company making CRT TVs.
[01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:16.630]  And I believe there's one in China that is like making new CRTs now.
[01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:19.390]  But it's it's not like a prevalent industry.
[01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.350]  I think they just need to make flat screens that look like cars or whatever.
[01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:24.250]  Like Garfield.
[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:28.190]  Give me like a Garfield flat screen TV where it looks like like he's hanging on,
[01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.950]  like he's in like the top left corner, like he's hanging on to like the top,
[01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:33.050]  like he's about to take a bite out of the TV or something.
[01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:37.290]  You can you imagine if you could get a flat screen Snoopy-esque TV?
[01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:38.550]  I'd get it right now.
[01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:40.150]  It would be it would be him.
[01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.230]  It'd be Joe Cool leaning at the bottom right corner.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.010]  You'd be like, oh, damn, he's leaning against my TV.
[01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.250]  Joe Cool's here and we're watching and we're watching Netflix.
[01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:49.690]  It's amazing how pleasing that stuff was to me as a kid,
[01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:52.470]  like giant plastic overhangs to make stuff look cool.
[01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:55.110]  I remember the the Pikachu N64.
[01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:56.130]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:58.650]  I had to it had to just like stick out on the side.
[01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:00.090]  Yeah. Ridiculous.
[01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:00.990]  Mm hmm.
[01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.810]  It's because it was designed for you.
[01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:05.730]  Yeah. You know, everything's about efficiency
[01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.770]  and like this modernist approach to a blank
[01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:11.670]  blandness that everyone can appreciate.
[01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:12.270]  And it's boring.
[01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.350]  I only think that that is the case.
[01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:21.050]  That's only driven by the sleek modernity is only driven by cheap.
[01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:22.090]  Like it's just cheaper.
[01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:25.930]  Yes. Yeah, it's just cheaper not to have shit hanging off stuff.
[01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:27.230]  Yeah. Mm hmm.
[01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:30.610]  And then you trick you into thinking that sleek and simple is cool.
[01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:31.810]  Like look at a fucking Tesla.
[01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.690]  I'm not I'm not trying to get into an Elon Musk thing,
[01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:36.870]  but you get into one of those Tesla's and you're just like, where is it?
[01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.270]  It's it's you just it's the whole thing is just like a piece of molded plastic.
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.390]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.030]  Where is it? Yeah.
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.490]  Imagine this was on your TV.
[01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:47.930]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:50.070]  Yeah, that that does something for me for some reason.
[01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:51.950]  It must have been the era we grew up in.
[01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:57.150]  Did you see the little TV that somebody made that it's the Simpsons TV
[01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:59.670]  and they put a Raspberry Pi in it
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:04.410]  and it just is playing the Simpsons nonstop like it's every episode of the Simpsons.
[01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:05.430]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:06.670]  It's so cool.
[01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:08.150]  Oh, that's really neat.
[01:13:08.210 --> 01:13:08.990]  Is that CRT?
[01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:10.690]  I don't think so.
[01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:13.250]  No, there's probably just a little 3D printed.
[01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.610]  Well, yeah.
[01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:17.270]  I wonder if anyone made it like a tube Gameboy.
[01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:19.010]  Oh, crazy.
[01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:20.670]  That would be insane.
[01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:24.550]  Well, I guess we'll find out when we all get together next time
[01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:25.990]  for the regulation podcast.
