[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.960 --> 00:10.500]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.940 --> 00:12.360]  Available for a limited time.
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.740]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.020 --> 00:18.300]  Hello and welcome to another regulation draft.
[00:18.480 --> 00:22.160]  This is one that I hope might become a yearly draft.
[00:22.300 --> 00:28.140]  This is the 2025 Regulation Nickname Draft Generator.
[00:28.140 --> 00:32.180]  What we are going to do is each one of us has come up with an...
[00:32.180 --> 00:34.560]  And by the way, I should say this is Gavin's idea as all are.
[00:34.760 --> 00:35.700]  100% Gavin's idea.
[00:36.000 --> 00:39.300]  I feel a little bit weird leading this one because this was 100% his idea.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.900]  But I'm going to do my best.
[00:42.160 --> 00:46.260]  Okay, so what we're going to do is we each off screen came up with one nickname
[00:46.260 --> 00:48.080]  for each of the other people in regulation.
[00:48.240 --> 00:51.980]  We are then going to snake draft it to list everybody's nicknames.
[00:52.080 --> 00:54.560]  Then we will all end up with four potential nicknames.
[00:54.760 --> 00:57.260]  What we'll do at that point is spin a wheel
[00:57.260 --> 01:04.600]  and let Chance describe what our nickname for the year 2025 is going to be.
[01:04.700 --> 01:06.320]  Did I do a good job of explaining that, Gavin?
[01:06.880 --> 01:07.940]  Fantastic, Jeff. Great job.
[01:08.280 --> 01:08.440]  All right.
[01:08.460 --> 01:08.840]  It was great.
[01:09.420 --> 01:11.900]  It's always hard to translate somebody else's vision, you know?
[01:12.120 --> 01:12.840]  Yeah, I know.
[01:12.900 --> 01:13.640]  The important...
[01:13.640 --> 01:13.720]  Was this my job?
[01:14.100 --> 01:14.700]  Yeah. No, go ahead.
[01:14.960 --> 01:15.580]  Oh, yeah, go ahead.
[01:15.760 --> 01:16.040]  Sorry.
[01:16.400 --> 01:17.480]  Was this your idea, Jeff?
[01:17.960 --> 01:20.580]  Well, I think it's pretty clear that it was yours based on everything I just said.
[01:21.900 --> 01:23.300]  No, this one's nothing to do with me.
[01:23.820 --> 01:25.800]  I would never take credit for an idea that wasn't mine.
[01:25.800 --> 01:28.880]  Listen, I already wrote my nickname down for you, so I can't pick humble.
[01:29.000 --> 01:29.860]  But God, would I?
[01:32.900 --> 01:37.780]  Okay, so the way this is going to work is we're going to randomize the names.
[01:38.080 --> 01:39.600]  And then when you're randomized,
[01:40.620 --> 01:43.780]  imagine that what's happening left to right is also going from top to bottom.
[01:44.080 --> 01:48.320]  So in this Anneg order, Andrew would never pick a nickname for himself.
[01:48.620 --> 01:50.540]  Neither would Nick, me, Jeff, Gavin.
[01:50.660 --> 01:52.020]  So those will remain Xs.
[01:52.120 --> 01:55.400]  But this first round, if we use this order, would be Andrew.
[01:55.400 --> 01:57.380]  So let's randomize.
[01:57.540 --> 01:59.680]  But how many times are we going to randomize?
[02:00.280 --> 02:01.500]  Five, because it's 2025.
[02:02.240 --> 02:04.120]  We did do five for our last draft.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.600]  I don't know if that's a factor.
[02:06.440 --> 02:08.060]  Six, because there's one more than the last draft.
[02:08.380 --> 02:08.740]  Hell yeah.
[02:08.920 --> 02:09.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09.940 --> 02:11.320]  All right, here comes six.
[02:11.700 --> 02:12.840]  Gavin didn't have anything to say about it.
[02:12.900 --> 02:13.480]  This wasn't his idea.
[02:13.520 --> 02:13.780]  Here we go.
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.240]  One, two, three, four, five.
[02:17.580 --> 02:19.540]  Nick, Jeff, Andrew, Eric, Gavin.
[02:19.700 --> 02:22.340]  And finally, six.
[02:23.680 --> 02:27.640]  This is Nick, Andrew, Eric, Jeff, Gavin.
[02:27.820 --> 02:36.420]  So this first round of the nicknames draft will be everyone giving Nick his nickname.
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.200]  Andrew, we start with you.
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.640]  My nickname for Nick, he's an audio guy.
[02:43.840 --> 02:44.580]  He's a sound guy.
[02:44.660 --> 02:47.080]  He brings you everything that you need.
[02:47.740 --> 02:49.560]  I thought about a lot of different options.
[02:49.560 --> 02:53.920]  Ended up with Schwartwave is my nickname for Nick.
[02:55.720 --> 02:58.180]  S-C-H-W-A-R-T-wave.
[02:58.180 --> 02:58.780]  I like that.
[02:58.900 --> 03:00.480]  One word, Schwartwave.
[03:00.880 --> 03:01.320]  Schwartwave.
[03:01.900 --> 03:03.020]  I mean, it's like...
[03:03.020 --> 03:04.460]  Incorporate the last name.
[03:04.560 --> 03:05.580]  He's an audio guy.
[03:05.660 --> 03:07.140]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[03:07.540 --> 03:08.120]  Like, it's cute.
[03:08.280 --> 03:10.520]  I don't like saying it.
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.840]  Like, it doesn't feel good.
[03:12.000 --> 03:14.660]  I feel a lot better saying that than his gamertag.
[03:14.820 --> 03:15.860]  I'll tell you that much.
[03:16.460 --> 03:19.760]  It sounds like something that's very dirty in the urban dictionary.
[03:20.020 --> 03:20.420]  Yeah.
[03:20.620 --> 03:21.460]  Oh, a Schwartwave?
[03:21.700 --> 03:22.080]  Oh, yeah.
[03:22.220 --> 03:23.820]  I took a Schwartwave last night.
[03:24.120 --> 03:24.520]  Yeah.
[03:24.680 --> 03:28.240]  I've been very innocent in my thinking of it, but I completely see where you're coming from.
[03:28.260 --> 03:28.420]  Yeah.
[03:28.780 --> 03:32.500]  I feel like the lack of the Z really draws attention to the wart.
[03:32.980 --> 03:33.280]  Yeah.
[03:34.240 --> 03:35.640]  It's a little heavy on the wart.
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.040]  It is very wart heavy.
[03:37.240 --> 03:39.240]  Well, Nick, maybe that won't be your nickname.
[03:39.420 --> 03:41.660]  Maybe your nickname will be the one that I pick for you.
[03:41.740 --> 03:44.640]  And when I think of Nick, I only think of one thing.
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.640]  And that's Showbiz, baby.
[03:46.940 --> 03:47.420]  Yeah!
[03:47.720 --> 03:48.980]  Oh, Showbiz!
[03:49.000 --> 03:49.660]  That's me!
[03:51.020 --> 03:51.780]  Showbiz Nick!
[03:52.280 --> 03:59.640]  I think for a year, if we called Nick Al as of Showbiz, I think that's great.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.940]  I think Showbiz is a great nickname for Nick.
[04:04.280 --> 04:04.760]  Why?
[04:05.380 --> 04:06.120]  What do you mean?
[04:06.140 --> 04:06.520]  Why not?
[04:06.540 --> 04:08.140]  When I think of Nick, baby, I'm thinking Showbiz.
[04:08.900 --> 04:09.760]  Finger guns.
[04:09.900 --> 04:11.300]  Yeah, I don't think of Showbiz...
[04:11.300 --> 04:14.620]  To me, I'm imagining, like, glasses, movie, cool guy.
[04:14.860 --> 04:15.920]  And Nick is not that.
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.640]  Now I'm just imagining him doing jazz hands into one of those mirrors with all the light bulbs around.
[04:20.640 --> 04:20.940]  Yeah.
[04:21.080 --> 04:22.080]  Oh, I like that.
[04:22.240 --> 04:24.760]  Oh, I don't like Showbiz as much now.
[04:25.200 --> 04:27.380]  I hope Showbiz is the one that gets picked.
[04:28.840 --> 04:30.400]  Oh, this wheel is gonna be so much fun.
[04:32.160 --> 04:34.260]  Well, that's where we're at right now.
[04:34.780 --> 04:37.040]  And Jeff, what's your nickname for Nick?
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.320]  Well, I must admit, I had the most nicknames for Nick.
[04:40.320 --> 04:41.280]  Oh, really?
[04:42.400 --> 04:43.780]  Well, I think it's hilarious.
[04:44.200 --> 04:49.640]  And there's a palpable irony in the fact that his name is in the title of this draft.
[04:50.040 --> 04:52.540]  Nick is the first part of nickname, right?
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.860]  So you could call him the apostrophe.
[04:55.340 --> 04:56.540]  You could call him...
[04:56.540 --> 04:59.220]  I thought paper cut, because Nick is a paper cut, right?
[04:59.460 --> 05:01.900]  But then I thought, what do I really know most about Nick?
[05:01.920 --> 05:04.560]  And I know two things that are indelible about Nick.
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.480]  I know he wears a monkey mask sometimes.
[05:06.480 --> 05:08.520]  And I know that in the year 2025,
[05:08.820 --> 05:11.660]  he will appear at a mall somewhere in America in giant red boots.
[05:11.840 --> 05:15.240]  And I thought, who exemplifies those two qualities?
[05:15.860 --> 05:19.400]  Boots from Dora the Explorer is a monkey that wears red boots.
[05:19.780 --> 05:21.740]  I put the picture up in the chat so you can see it.
[05:21.820 --> 05:23.640]  And so my nickname for Nick is Boots.
[05:23.920 --> 05:25.560]  Dude, Boots is a really good one.
[05:25.840 --> 05:27.000]  Boots, I think is a great one.
[05:27.420 --> 05:28.900]  Boots is such a good nickname, dude.
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.400]  That rocks. Boots is a...
[05:30.400 --> 05:31.100]  I love it.
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.420]  And that looks like Nick right there.
[05:32.840 --> 05:32.960]  Yeah.
[05:33.880 --> 05:35.000]  Hey, it's me!
[05:36.480 --> 05:37.720]  Hey, showbiz, calm down.
[05:40.240 --> 05:41.260]  Fill out Boots.
[05:42.980 --> 05:44.520]  See, these all work!
[05:45.000 --> 05:46.660]  These are great. These are great.
[05:47.460 --> 05:50.420]  And that's three of the four nicknames.
[05:50.560 --> 05:54.280]  Now we leave it up to Gavin for the final nickname for Nick.
[05:55.240 --> 05:56.780]  Well, Nick's a real busy guy.
[05:57.260 --> 06:01.460]  Sometimes we want to film videos and, you know, Nick's off doing something all the time.
[06:02.340 --> 06:03.340]  His car's in the shop.
[06:04.260 --> 06:05.640]  His car's often in the shop.
[06:05.640 --> 06:09.480]  So my nickname for him is The Mechanic.
[06:13.920 --> 06:14.800]  Real good.
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.220]  And I like a nickname that's like a role.
[06:17.360 --> 06:20.080]  It's like, you know, there's Jimmy, there's Steve, and just that's The Mechanic.
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.120]  That's pretty good.
[06:22.480 --> 06:22.860]  Wow.
[06:23.140 --> 06:24.000]  That is pretty good.
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.500]  I'm so excited to see what your nickname's going to be now.
[06:28.500 --> 06:31.220]  Well, that's all of Nick's nicknames I really like.
[06:31.300 --> 06:34.880]  And that's SchwartwaveShowbizBootsInTheMechanic.
[06:34.880 --> 06:36.000]  Those are cool.
[06:36.880 --> 06:38.200]  Nick, how do you feel about those?
[06:38.240 --> 06:38.600]  You like them?
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.640]  I feel good.
[06:40.260 --> 06:43.560]  Of all of them, I think Schwartwave is the one that I want least.
[06:44.180 --> 06:44.620]  Really?
[06:45.560 --> 06:47.780]  Well, that one came from Andrew.
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.920]  And now it's time for you to nickname Andrew because our second round is Andrew nicknames.
[06:53.960 --> 06:54.760]  And we start with Nick.
[06:55.160 --> 06:55.520]  Oh, boy.
[06:56.280 --> 06:59.320]  Well, I was thinking, what do we know about Andrew?
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.140]  We know he's a Winnie the Pooh guy.
[07:01.420 --> 07:01.740]  Okay.
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.200]  Uh-huh.
[07:03.300 --> 07:05.760]  But his name is Andrew.
[07:07.420 --> 07:08.420]  That's also true.
[07:08.680 --> 07:14.540]  So I kind of combine them into a fun little deal where he's going to be Andy Pants.
[07:15.140 --> 07:15.840]  Hate it.
[07:16.660 --> 07:17.840]  Absolutely hate it.
[07:17.960 --> 07:20.640]  Honestly, I love Andy Pants.
[07:20.800 --> 07:23.320]  I think that is all I was off the tongue.
[07:23.840 --> 07:26.380]  Dude, it's like a Joey Pants situation, dude.
[07:26.700 --> 07:26.960]  Yeah.
[07:27.120 --> 07:28.160]  I don't like pants.
[07:28.260 --> 07:29.620]  I don't like the name Andy.
[07:29.620 --> 07:32.740]  It's a double threat of things I do not enjoy.
[07:32.980 --> 07:36.560]  Nick, you just took a nickname away from me, and I'm not even mad at you.
[07:36.560 --> 07:37.540]  Oh, no way!
[07:37.860 --> 07:41.140]  No, I didn't come up with Andy Pants, but I came up with something similar.
[07:41.320 --> 07:43.000]  I was thinking the same thing.
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.820]  Winnie the Pooh, Pooh Bear, Andrew.
[07:45.060 --> 07:46.180]  I came up with Drew Bear.
[07:46.880 --> 07:47.140]  Wow.
[07:47.140 --> 07:47.760]  I like that a lot.
[07:47.980 --> 07:50.100]  Andy Pants is so much stronger than Drew Bear.
[07:50.280 --> 07:50.420]  Yeah.
[07:50.740 --> 07:52.260]  Well, Jeff's going to change his.
[07:52.360 --> 07:54.880]  But before we get to Jeff's, we got to get through mine.
[07:54.960 --> 07:58.700]  When I think of Andrew, there's only one thing that I think of.
[07:59.300 --> 08:00.140]  That's Gizmo.
[08:01.380 --> 08:03.240]  I like Gizmo. I'll take Gizmo.
[08:04.760 --> 08:05.460]  I love it.
[08:05.480 --> 08:06.080]  I don't mind that.
[08:06.340 --> 08:06.680]  See?
[08:07.140 --> 08:09.560]  I think it could be a Gizmo.
[08:10.200 --> 08:11.900]  Dude, oh, where's Gizmo?
[08:12.060 --> 08:14.000]  Oh, Gizmo's taking us through a crazy video.
[08:14.360 --> 08:15.780]  Oh, Gizmo's making us play safe party.
[08:16.220 --> 08:17.520]  Yeah, he's doing something.
[08:18.000 --> 08:19.340]  Never know what Gizmo's up to.
[08:19.680 --> 08:20.380]  Oh, that right there?
[08:20.460 --> 08:21.060]  That's Gizmo.
[08:21.520 --> 08:21.940]  That's...
[08:21.940 --> 08:22.200]  Oh, yeah.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.580]  I'm feeling good about Gizmo as a nickname for Andrew.
[08:24.580 --> 08:27.080]  It's like, oh, no, Andrew's in Gizmode again.
[08:27.660 --> 08:29.780]  See? This really works.
[08:29.940 --> 08:33.660]  I think Gavin is befuddled by my two nicknames so far.
[08:34.260 --> 08:35.460]  Topaz and Gizmo.
[08:35.760 --> 08:38.200]  It's like a piece of jank puppets.
[08:40.740 --> 08:42.760]  Keep that in mind as we get deeper.
[08:43.820 --> 08:45.680]  Jeff, what is your...
[08:45.680 --> 08:49.460]  We already know that you had a nickname that you're wiping off the board,
[08:49.580 --> 08:51.340]  but what's the one you're going to go with?
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.000]  It's okay.
[08:52.060 --> 08:54.100]  I'm going to go with my backup, which I like as well.
[08:54.100 --> 08:59.600]  One thing I think we all know about Andrew is that he is wholesome and wonderful and sweet and kind
[09:00.380 --> 09:01.180]  and gentle.
[09:01.180 --> 09:01.560]  Oh, no.
[09:01.620 --> 09:02.420]  And he's like...
[09:02.420 --> 09:02.520]  Oh, no.
[09:02.980 --> 09:05.560]  Andrew, to me, is like a big, warm hug, right?
[09:05.600 --> 09:05.760]  Yeah.
[09:06.040 --> 09:09.580]  And I think that it's great that we know that about him,
[09:09.620 --> 09:12.020]  but I also think that there's a darker side to Andrew.
[09:12.140 --> 09:12.460]  Oh, no.
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.100]  I know he's coming.
[09:14.020 --> 09:16.820]  He's got Raymond Sommer in the background.
[09:16.860 --> 09:17.420]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:17.420 --> 09:18.380]  Becomes a different person.
[09:18.700 --> 09:21.980]  He may or may not be affiliated with the Vancouver Child Kicker.
[09:21.980 --> 09:25.580]  We know he likes to watch women pee at McDonald's.
[09:25.960 --> 09:28.620]  Like there are these little dark elements that you see,
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.840]  but none of them can be truly tied to him.
[09:31.920 --> 09:35.380]  But what do we know about Andrew that we can tie to him?
[09:35.440 --> 09:39.520]  I want to toughen him up a little bit because we know how wholesome he is,
[09:39.600 --> 09:41.780]  but I want the world to feel a little bit of his edge.
[09:42.020 --> 09:44.600]  So I looked at like the last year and here's what I came up with.
[09:44.660 --> 09:46.920]  Andrew Panton, the Herman Miller killer.
[09:47.360 --> 09:48.160]  Oh, I like that.
[09:48.740 --> 09:49.180]  What?
[09:49.640 --> 09:52.580]  They said it couldn't be done, but he did it.
[09:52.900 --> 09:55.620]  The Herman Miller killer?
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.220]  Yeah, or Herman Miller killer.
[09:57.360 --> 09:58.300]  Whatever, the Herman Miller killer.
[09:58.460 --> 09:58.520]  Yeah.
[09:59.000 --> 09:59.340]  OK.
[09:59.780 --> 10:01.600]  So you might just be shortened to Herman sometimes.
[10:03.000 --> 10:03.980]  Yeah, or killer.
[10:06.040 --> 10:06.920]  Or Miller.
[10:08.360 --> 10:10.940]  There's there's a lot of there's a lot at play.
[10:11.080 --> 10:13.740]  As long as it's not her killer, I'm OK with it.
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.360]  OK, all right.
[10:15.360 --> 10:21.380]  Um, well, Andrew's nickname for 2025 could be the Herman Miller killer.
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.960]  It could be this next one that Gavin's going to lay down for us.
[10:27.540 --> 10:31.800]  Well, as we all know, Andrew needs to eat the goddamn pencil, right?
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.660]  OK, inside the pencil is what people used to think was lead.
[10:38.720 --> 10:40.900]  It was actually graphite, but people call it lead.
[10:40.980 --> 10:41.540]  Still do.
[10:41.540 --> 10:45.840]  On the periodic table, lead is represented by the letters PB.
[10:46.540 --> 10:47.500]  Why is that?
[10:47.780 --> 10:48.440]  I looked it up.
[10:48.740 --> 10:50.540]  It's Latin for plumbum.
[10:52.220 --> 10:54.020]  I give you plumbum.
[10:54.480 --> 10:57.700]  Well, how are you feeling about Andy Pants now?
[10:58.520 --> 11:01.140]  I still have that rank at the bottom.
[11:01.840 --> 11:03.560]  I'll take plumbum over Andy Pants.
[11:03.760 --> 11:04.140]  Wow.
[11:04.820 --> 11:06.680]  That's how much I dislike Andy Pants.
[11:06.720 --> 11:09.900]  Now, I got to say, of these names, you got to be praying for Gizmo.
[11:10.720 --> 11:12.900]  Uh, yeah, I think Gizmo's the best.
[11:13.860 --> 11:17.200]  I don't mind Herman Miller Killer or Gizmo, that's for sure.
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.480]  But I definitely, after Andy Pants, it was the first time it occurred to me
[11:21.480 --> 11:23.480]  I might not like any of the names on the wheel.
[11:23.620 --> 11:24.660]  And that is scary.
[11:27.560 --> 11:30.540]  Now, if it helps, that's all I've been thinking about is
[11:30.540 --> 11:32.560]  I'm not going to like any of the names on the wheel.
[11:32.620 --> 11:35.520]  But we go to me in the next round and it starts with Nick.
[11:35.800 --> 11:37.020]  Could you make it one word, by the way?
[11:37.320 --> 11:37.960]  Oh, is it plumb?
[11:37.960 --> 11:39.140]  It's just this.
[11:39.300 --> 11:39.600]  It's plumbum.
[11:40.340 --> 11:40.920]  Oh boy.
[11:41.540 --> 11:42.020]  Okay.
[11:42.520 --> 11:42.840]  All right.
[11:43.840 --> 11:46.460]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[11:46.820 --> 11:50.100]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.340]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[11:52.580 --> 11:55.800]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[11:55.960 --> 12:00.220]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[12:00.460 --> 12:03.940]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[12:04.280 --> 12:06.220]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[12:09.520 --> 12:10.780]  Hey, it's Paris.
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.280]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[12:13.520 --> 12:14.340]  Like stars.
[12:14.760 --> 12:15.040]  Duh.
[12:15.580 --> 12:19.180]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.080]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.800]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[12:29.340 --> 12:31.840]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.080]  That's hot.
[12:33.700 --> 12:36.760]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[12:37.140 --> 12:38.480]  Hilton for the stay.
[12:39.080 --> 12:41.400]  Nick, this third round is Eric.
[12:41.840 --> 12:43.480]  All right, well, what do we know about Eric?
[12:44.120 --> 12:44.600]  What do we know?
[12:44.680 --> 12:46.920]  We know he's tough under pressure.
[12:47.080 --> 12:47.720]  He holds it together.
[12:47.860 --> 12:48.300]  He's great.
[12:48.820 --> 12:50.540]  He's real solid.
[12:50.780 --> 12:53.360]  He's simple and easygoing.
[12:54.380 --> 12:57.460]  I have named Eric Easy E.
[12:58.060 --> 12:58.580]  Whoa!
[12:59.160 --> 13:01.680]  Okay, I love it.
[13:02.020 --> 13:02.740]  I love it.
[13:02.860 --> 13:03.680]  That's great.
[13:04.160 --> 13:06.400]  And it's the one that I'm hoping for so far.
[13:06.400 --> 13:09.940]  And I have a feeling with the way the rest of this round is going to go,
[13:10.060 --> 13:12.920]  it's probably going to be the one I'm hoping for in the end.
[13:13.220 --> 13:14.040]  Isn't that...
[13:14.040 --> 13:16.380]  I mean, didn't the last Easy E die of AIDS?
[13:16.820 --> 13:17.400]  He did.
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.260]  Yeah, but that's fine.
[13:18.320 --> 13:20.500]  I got to carry on that tradition.
[13:20.980 --> 13:22.880]  Oh, plus the name is free now, right?
[13:23.120 --> 13:25.520]  Also, that was Easy E with a Z.
[13:25.860 --> 13:27.020]  Z, that's an excellent point.
[13:27.360 --> 13:29.200]  Yeah, so there's a little difference.
[13:29.400 --> 13:31.060]  Easy E, the first nickname for me.
[13:31.100 --> 13:31.920]  Andrew, what do you got?
[13:32.480 --> 13:33.100]  Oh boy.
[13:33.340 --> 13:35.720]  Okay, well, you can throw me on the
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.780]  you're-not-going-to-like-a-pile.
[13:37.300 --> 13:37.980]  Get the no shit.
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.300]  I thought about Easy E, but I thought that that's already associated with somebody else.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.920]  Had a bunch of different nicknames.
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.120]  I ultimately landed on...
[13:47.880 --> 13:51.340]  There's, as we've talked about a lot, things we know to be true.
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.800]  There's just indisputable evidence of you hanging out with Ratty Boy,
[13:57.200 --> 13:59.220]  being best friends with Ratty Boy.
[13:59.500 --> 14:02.700]  So I figured what better nickname than Rat E-Boy?
[14:03.720 --> 14:06.160]  Rat, capitalized E, Boy.
[14:07.900 --> 14:08.600]  Ratty Boy.
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.700]  Yeah, at least you're right.
[14:11.860 --> 14:12.700]  I'd hate it.
[14:13.220 --> 14:13.800]  Is it like this?
[14:14.200 --> 14:15.080]  Yeah, that works.
[14:15.400 --> 14:16.060]  Oh, I like that.
[14:16.180 --> 14:16.780]  Ratty Boy.
[14:17.540 --> 14:18.060]  Yeah, cool.
[14:18.200 --> 14:18.560]  I'm cool.
[14:18.700 --> 14:19.880]  I'm glad you guys like it.
[14:20.100 --> 14:20.560]  That's great.
[14:20.960 --> 14:23.160]  Well, don't really hold that for an Easy E on this one.
[14:23.640 --> 14:25.260]  Don't apologize for something you're not sorry for.
[14:25.580 --> 14:25.960]  Jeff!
[14:26.360 --> 14:27.980]  Well, hold off.
[14:28.080 --> 14:28.680]  You might...
[14:28.680 --> 14:30.440]  Listen, you haven't heard my nickname for you yet.
[14:30.440 --> 14:33.040]  And I took a lot into consideration when I picked it.
[14:33.080 --> 14:35.100]  And I think that there's a chance you might absolutely love it.
[14:35.140 --> 14:37.520]  And if you do, we'll learn a little bit something about you today.
[14:37.600 --> 14:39.340]  But I was thinking, what do I know about Eric?
[14:39.360 --> 14:40.260]  I know that he's a little guy.
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.020]  I know he has a small wife.
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.580]  I know that he's the president of our company.
[14:46.760 --> 14:48.640]  I know he likes baseball and I know he likes rats.
[14:48.980 --> 14:52.980]  So I put all those things together and I came up with a nickname for you
[14:52.980 --> 14:54.240]  that I think you'll absolutely love.
[14:54.620 --> 15:00.020]  As the president of regulation, I think your new nickname could be Lil Trump.
[15:01.500 --> 15:04.200]  Dude, that's the craziest, like...
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.660]  I mean, just so we're clear, I won't be taking that nickname no matter what.
[15:10.900 --> 15:13.420]  Even if it lands on it, we'll just redo.
[15:13.740 --> 15:14.500]  So that's fine.
[15:14.940 --> 15:15.940]  I mean, that's up to you.
[15:16.240 --> 15:18.100]  I'm definitely not taking Lil Trump.
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.640]  God, you got to take whatever the wheel gives you.
[15:21.960 --> 15:23.180]  You got to take whatever the wheel gives you.
[15:23.180 --> 15:26.580]  I think my nickname for Jeff is going to be Dumbfuck Stupid Asshole.
[15:26.840 --> 15:29.440]  And that just might be what he has to be for the rest of the year.
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.420]  That could be it.
[15:30.640 --> 15:32.060]  We'll see what the wheel decides.
[15:32.060 --> 15:32.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:33.100 --> 15:33.760]  OK, cool.
[15:33.980 --> 15:34.220]  Great.
[15:35.020 --> 15:35.120]  Gavin?
[15:35.840 --> 15:37.600]  Well, I'm going to go the opposite of Nick.
[15:37.780 --> 15:38.940]  Nick is focused on the E.
[15:39.580 --> 15:41.020]  I'm removing it completely.
[15:41.300 --> 15:43.340]  And I'm going to go with Lil Ricky B.
[15:44.740 --> 15:46.760]  That actually was a backup of mine.
[15:47.100 --> 15:48.880]  Lil Ricky B.
[15:49.720 --> 15:51.200]  Lil Ricky B.
[15:51.340 --> 15:51.600]  OK.
[15:53.000 --> 15:53.580]  There it is.
[15:53.680 --> 15:54.300]  Two Lils on the board.
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.060]  Easy E.
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.320]  Lil Rat E-Boy.
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.840]  Lil Trump, which I won't be using.
[15:58.840 --> 16:00.860]  And Lil Ricky B.
[16:01.060 --> 16:01.680]  There you go.
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.360]  Those are four nicknames.
[16:05.620 --> 16:09.460]  What I really like is that I've noticed the more preamble before the name,
[16:09.760 --> 16:13.380]  the more the person thinks that you're going to dislike it when they deliver it.
[16:14.140 --> 16:20.040]  So he gave Nick the nickname Boots, and then he said Lil Trump.
[16:20.740 --> 16:21.140]  All right, man.
[16:21.240 --> 16:22.920]  Yeah, it's just what seemed to fit, you know?
[16:22.920 --> 16:23.340]  Cool, man.
[16:23.440 --> 16:23.980]  Yeah, that's great.
[16:24.140 --> 16:24.450]  Yeah, 100%.
[16:25.500 --> 16:27.560]  Because you're the president, and he's the president.
[16:27.560 --> 16:30.120]  Might talk to the attorney and fold this company.
[16:31.960 --> 16:37.080]  Next is Jeff's nickname, and this is where you start.
[16:37.180 --> 16:38.020]  Nick, what do you have for Jeff?
[16:38.380 --> 16:39.400]  What do we know about Jeff?
[16:39.520 --> 16:40.940]  We know he has a dog.
[16:41.020 --> 16:41.720]  He loves dogs.
[16:42.100 --> 16:44.460]  He is a big hot dog fan.
[16:44.540 --> 16:48.360]  He's the one that's going to eat as many hot dogs as the average man,
[16:48.400 --> 16:50.480]  according to that thing that Jeff found online.
[16:50.960 --> 16:56.500]  I think that we could do Doggy G, interchangeable with G-Dog.
[16:56.760 --> 16:57.340]  I'll take it.
[16:57.340 --> 16:58.260]  I love Doggy G.
[16:58.540 --> 16:59.960]  I'll put G-Dog or Doggy G.
[17:00.220 --> 17:01.860]  That's a really usable nickname.
[17:02.260 --> 17:03.180]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[17:03.880 --> 17:05.040]  Doggy G is pretty good.
[17:05.120 --> 17:05.860]  I like Doggy G.
[17:06.040 --> 17:09.780]  Did you imagine it, Nick, as D-O-G on G-Dog or D-A-W-G?
[17:10.280 --> 17:10.740]  D-O-G.
[17:11.140 --> 17:11.340]  Nice.
[17:11.440 --> 17:11.640]  There you go.
[17:12.060 --> 17:14.040]  Yeah, I feel like more of a D-O-G.
[17:14.240 --> 17:19.600]  Yeah, I just think because it's Doggy G, it should be G-Dog.
[17:19.860 --> 17:23.540]  But, Andrew, it's your pick for Jeff's nickname.
[17:23.540 --> 17:29.420]  I was sweating during Nick's preamble because I only have one nickname for all of you.
[17:29.600 --> 17:32.580]  And mine also is hot dog related to Jeff.
[17:32.920 --> 17:35.700]  I'm glad we didn't go in the same lane.
[17:35.960 --> 17:43.640]  When I think of Jeff, two things that really stand out, his love of hot dogs and his love of Dallas.
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.600]  So what better way than to combine the two?
[17:47.020 --> 17:49.460]  My nickname for Jeff is Boss Dog.
[17:49.460 --> 17:57.100]  Oh, I want to see him walking around all white outfit, big cowboy hat, just chomping on the dogs.
[17:57.420 --> 17:58.840]  Yeah, he's a great name so far.
[17:59.100 --> 18:03.520]  I think everybody's names are great, personally.
[18:04.100 --> 18:06.160]  I had some good names.
[18:07.040 --> 18:12.000]  I only had one nickname for Andrew and only one nickname for Nick.
[18:12.080 --> 18:15.560]  But I have one, two, three, four, five for Jeff.
[18:15.940 --> 18:18.660]  And the one I'm going to go with is Baby Pepsi.
[18:20.080 --> 18:21.120]  Baby Pepsi.
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.520]  Oh, that might be my favorite so far, actually.
[18:25.840 --> 18:28.500]  Just imagine walking into the room, there he is.
[18:28.740 --> 18:31.480]  Oh, dude, here comes Showbiz Gizmo and Baby Pepsi.
[18:32.020 --> 18:32.900]  Baby Pepsi.
[18:33.360 --> 18:35.300]  That's Baby Pepsi right there, dude.
[18:35.320 --> 18:35.960]  I love it.
[18:36.080 --> 18:37.320]  Yeah, there's Baby Pepsi.
[18:37.980 --> 18:38.400]  Thank you.
[18:38.800 --> 18:43.600]  Yeah, I'm an animatronic in Nick's Showbiz Pizza and we only serve Baby Pepsi.
[18:44.080 --> 18:44.520]  Baby Pepsi.
[18:44.520 --> 18:46.100]  Oh, shit, it's Baby Pepsi.
[18:46.160 --> 18:46.900]  Pepsi products only, bitch.
[18:48.980 --> 18:51.740]  Gavin, you've known Jeff the longest, right?
[18:51.860 --> 18:53.940]  Like, what kind of nickname are you giving this guy?
[18:54.560 --> 18:57.020]  Well, his name is Jeffrey Laser Ramsey.
[18:58.220 --> 19:01.280]  And I just thought I'd hack a few letters out of here and there.
[19:01.360 --> 19:02.940]  You know, maybe keep the G and the E of Jeff.
[19:03.040 --> 19:04.800]  Maybe like the Z, you know.
[19:06.140 --> 19:06.540]  Geezer.
[19:08.240 --> 19:09.460]  Just straight up Geezer.
[19:09.740 --> 19:10.100]  That's Geezer.
[19:10.440 --> 19:12.260]  Is it Geezer or Geeza?
[19:12.800 --> 19:14.220]  No, it's E-R because of...
[19:14.220 --> 19:15.120]  Just making sure.
[19:15.460 --> 19:18.560]  Like an incredibly old dude, Geezer?
[19:19.200 --> 19:20.040]  There's Geezer.
[19:20.500 --> 19:21.520]  I guess I am old.
[19:21.720 --> 19:22.440]  All right, I'll take it.
[19:22.980 --> 19:23.900]  There's Geezer.
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.920]  Okay, we got the nicknames for four of the five members of the regulation crew.
[19:30.560 --> 19:33.180]  We finally go to Gavin and his nickname.
[19:33.340 --> 19:35.540]  So, Nick, what nickname are you giving to Gavin?
[19:36.020 --> 19:41.260]  Well, the thing about Gavin is he still hasn't figured out that goddamn CPAP machine.
[19:41.320 --> 19:42.000]  It's true, yeah.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.380]  And he keeps being miserable.
[19:44.380 --> 19:47.460]  So I'm going to go ahead and call him Gassy Goo.
[19:53.340 --> 19:56.200]  Which is what he just made in the bathroom a few minutes ago.
[19:58.080 --> 20:00.340]  That's so accurate to the last thing I did.
[20:03.240 --> 20:06.000]  Well, you already have Gabby Goo, so hello, Gassy Goo.
[20:06.160 --> 20:06.920]  Oh, man.
[20:07.320 --> 20:08.580]  Oh, good God.
[20:09.380 --> 20:10.220]  Oh, that's great.
[20:10.220 --> 20:14.320]  Uh, Andrew, what nickname do you have for your friend Gavin?
[20:15.080 --> 20:16.800]  Gavin's the one I've struggled the most with.
[20:16.940 --> 20:20.780]  I couldn't think of a great combination for a long time.
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.980]  I spent a lot of time thinking about it.
[20:23.240 --> 20:28.420]  Eventually came to the conclusion of, uh, what's Gavin's name?
[20:28.480 --> 20:28.940]  Gavin Free.
[20:29.440 --> 20:30.600]  What is Gavin known for?
[20:30.680 --> 20:31.280]  Bird noises.
[20:31.420 --> 20:32.980]  My nickname for Gavin, Free Bird.
[20:35.880 --> 20:36.940]  That's pretty good.
[20:37.360 --> 20:39.040]  I really like that.
[20:39.040 --> 20:40.280]  I think that is great.
[20:41.060 --> 20:43.660]  I think doing a like a free thing is really good.
[20:43.720 --> 20:46.380]  I was just going, I was going to just go like drop free.
[20:46.560 --> 20:47.400]  I'm like, I'll name you Free.
[20:47.540 --> 20:48.580]  Maybe that's an easy one.
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.260]  There's a couple different things that I was going to go with.
[20:51.300 --> 20:53.260]  I was going to try to do like a bond thing or whatever.
[20:54.420 --> 20:55.860]  Kind of like, you know, like Gab Finger.
[20:55.960 --> 20:57.420]  Like, I thought that would be like fun or whatever.
[20:57.640 --> 21:00.340]  But instead I'm going with Lil Spooky.
[21:01.180 --> 21:01.900]  Lil Spooky.
[21:01.900 --> 21:03.220]  Lil Spooky.
[21:03.680 --> 21:09.540]  What if everybody's nickname is Lil in 2025?
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.420]  Well, Lil's out there.
[21:12.460 --> 21:13.140]  I can see it.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.320]  Why Lil Spooky?
[21:14.640 --> 21:15.660]  Hey, what's up everybody?
[21:15.760 --> 21:16.540]  It's Lil Spooky.
[21:16.700 --> 21:17.620]  Lil Ricky B.
[21:19.300 --> 21:24.760]  I don't think Lil Spooky is a thing that Gavin's ever been, which I like about his nickname.
[21:25.360 --> 21:26.820]  No one's ever feared me.
[21:27.200 --> 21:28.600]  It's like when you call a tall guy tiny.
[21:28.960 --> 21:30.020]  That's what I'm saying.
[21:30.020 --> 21:31.960]  Oh man, what's up?
[21:32.000 --> 21:32.660]  It's Lil Spooky.
[21:34.760 --> 21:35.700]  That's Lil Spooky.
[21:36.280 --> 21:39.940]  And now, finally, Jeff, you've known this guy the longest, right?
[21:40.240 --> 21:40.460]  I have.
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.440]  What kind of nickname are you giving to him?
[21:42.780 --> 21:46.640]  Well, you know, uh...
[21:46.640 --> 21:47.660]  Lil Boris Johnson.
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.700]  Gavin's been in my life for a very long time.
[21:49.920 --> 21:50.920]  Here comes the preamble.
[21:51.040 --> 21:53.040]  I've known a lot about Gavin.
[21:53.180 --> 21:55.620]  I feel like I have lived inside his head and vice versa.
[21:55.820 --> 21:58.560]  We are... he's my best friend in the entire world.
[21:58.560 --> 22:03.640]  And so I wanted to really get something that kind of distills Gavin down to his pure essence.
[22:03.740 --> 22:08.280]  Like, what is... if you peel away all the layers of the onion, what are you left with?
[22:08.460 --> 22:13.800]  And that's why I think in 2025, Gavin's nickname should be Dan's Friend.
[22:16.300 --> 22:17.500]  Holy shit.
[22:17.760 --> 22:19.540]  Oh my god.
[22:19.680 --> 22:21.140]  The water balloon kink guy?
[22:23.760 --> 22:26.880]  We have to call him Dan's Friend.
[22:31.180 --> 22:34.440]  So I'm just going to introduce myself as Dan's Friend to people who don't know him.
[22:34.540 --> 22:36.200]  Hi, I'm Dan's Friend Gavin.
[22:36.460 --> 22:38.040]  Hi, I'm Dan's Friend.
[22:38.600 --> 22:40.920]  Oh, I'm Dan's Friend Gavin.
[22:41.540 --> 22:43.240]  I've been laughing about that all morning.
[22:45.440 --> 22:50.420]  That is maybe the funniest way to describe Gavin is Dan's Friend.
[22:51.000 --> 22:52.380]  Oh, dude.
[22:52.720 --> 22:54.420]  It might be the least respectful.
[23:00.280 --> 23:04.200]  It's just said with such an abundance of love and affection, too.
[23:05.260 --> 23:07.980]  Dude, I am... that's so funny.
[23:08.060 --> 23:12.700]  Well, we picked the nicknames, but it's not over because now, like we do,
[23:12.860 --> 23:17.860]  we must leave it up to the wheel as we go to the name... the name wheel.
[23:18.600 --> 23:23.620]  Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship,
[23:23.620 --> 23:24.920]  Star of the Seas.
[23:25.120 --> 23:28.860]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,
[23:29.060 --> 23:32.260]  with mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea,
[23:32.540 --> 23:35.180]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill,
[23:35.480 --> 23:37.600]  more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[23:37.780 --> 23:42.340]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.

[24:22.540 --> 24:23.400]  Yeah, I feel good.
[24:23.400 --> 24:24.900]  I'm pretty fucking happy.
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.100]  I think Nick's are really strong.
[24:28.320 --> 24:29.140]  Yeah, Nick is good.
[24:29.460 --> 24:30.840]  And we're going to start with Nick.
[24:31.440 --> 24:32.380]  Oh, sweet.
[24:32.540 --> 24:33.680]  Yeah, as we do this...
[24:35.380 --> 24:37.400]  Nick, you have the names...
[24:39.800 --> 24:40.400]  Schwartwave.
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.040]  Schwartwave.
[24:43.300 --> 24:43.520]  Showbiz.
[24:43.720 --> 24:44.560]  You have Showbiz.
[24:45.560 --> 24:47.200]  You have Boots.
[24:48.180 --> 24:51.140]  And you have The Mechanic.
[24:52.060 --> 24:57.000]  I'm going to shuffle because we shuffled six times to randomize the names.
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.280]  I'm going to shuffle six times before spinning the wheel.
[25:00.480 --> 25:00.960]  Fantastic.
[25:01.160 --> 25:03.660]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[25:03.820 --> 25:07.100]  And now, Nick, for your 2025 nickname.
[25:07.280 --> 25:07.740]  Here we go.
[25:07.760 --> 25:08.540]  So excited.
[25:09.080 --> 25:09.740]  The wheel spins.
[25:09.840 --> 25:10.500]  What's it going to be?
[25:10.540 --> 25:11.980]  Oh my god, I can't look.
[25:12.060 --> 25:12.720]  This is nuts.
[25:13.680 --> 25:16.100]  Nick is The Mechanic.
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.900]  Nick is The Mechanic.
[25:18.220 --> 25:19.620]  He got his number one.
[25:19.620 --> 25:23.080]  I'm so sad it's not Schwartwave.
[25:24.060 --> 25:26.220]  Well, maybe in 2026 it can be.
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.580]  But for 2025, we can only refer to him as Nick or The Mechanic.
[25:29.700 --> 25:30.500]  Well, there you go.
[25:31.200 --> 25:32.960]  Those are Nick's nicknames.
[25:33.280 --> 25:34.200]  That's what they are.
[25:34.400 --> 25:36.320]  And Nick is The Mechanic.
[25:36.440 --> 25:38.300]  Andrew, we move on to you.
[25:38.620 --> 25:40.980]  As you have been dubbed Andy Pants.
[25:41.380 --> 25:42.420]  Anything but that.
[25:42.900 --> 25:43.380]  Gizmo.
[25:44.060 --> 25:44.920]  I'm okay with that.
[25:45.220 --> 25:45.240]  Killer.
[25:45.960 --> 25:46.660]  Don't mind it.
[25:47.280 --> 25:47.760]  Plumbum.
[25:48.320 --> 25:50.640]  Don't love that one as much, but...
[25:50.640 --> 25:51.600]  And here we go.
[25:51.700 --> 25:53.320]  I'm really only cheering against Andy Pants.
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.460]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[25:56.620 --> 25:58.300]  And the spins begin.
[25:59.560 --> 26:00.140]  No pants.
[26:00.920 --> 26:01.840]  You're going to put them on, aren't you?
[26:02.080 --> 26:02.140]  No pants.
[26:02.480 --> 26:02.940]  Here we go.
[26:03.440 --> 26:03.980]  Big pants.
[26:04.300 --> 26:05.080]  Come on.
[26:05.340 --> 26:08.080]  Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo.
[26:08.200 --> 26:09.140]  It is Gizmo!
[26:09.140 --> 26:10.160]  It is Gizmo!
[26:13.400 --> 26:18.040]  And Andrew, for 2025, will be Gizmo.
[26:18.920 --> 26:19.320]  Congratulations, Gizmo.
[26:19.320 --> 26:21.720]  I think I have the best of both worlds of that one.
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.040]  There are two I really liked and...
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.420]  Way to go, Gizmo.
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.360]  I'm next.
[26:27.720 --> 26:28.720]  I have E-Z-E.
[26:29.280 --> 26:30.700]  I have Rat-E-Boy.
[26:31.220 --> 26:33.560]  I have Lil Trump, which I will never claim.
[26:33.720 --> 26:35.440]  And I have Lil Ricky.
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.220]  I believe in you.
[26:36.340 --> 26:39.080]  If it lands on Lil Trump, you're just going to write an executive order
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.380]  that changes the rules.
[26:40.640 --> 26:41.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[26:41.280 --> 26:42.840]  Do you want to change it to Lil Trump?
[26:43.100 --> 26:43.540]  We can.
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.820]  Two, three, four, five, six.
[26:45.920 --> 26:46.840]  Here we go!
[26:47.780 --> 26:48.560]  Oh boy.
[26:48.940 --> 26:49.800]  Know what I'm betting on?
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.800]  Uh-oh, it's Lil Ricky B!
[26:55.580 --> 26:58.700]  Honestly, Lil Ricky B works for me.
[26:59.200 --> 27:02.980]  I am Lil Ricky B for all of 2025.
[27:03.540 --> 27:05.700]  Gavin, how are you feeling about me going by your nickname?
[27:07.240 --> 27:08.180]  Uh, I like it.
[27:08.180 --> 27:09.320]  I'm happy with it.
[27:09.640 --> 27:11.280]  Lil Ricky B.
[27:11.280 --> 27:12.940]  You picked two of the nicknames so far, Gavin.
[27:12.940 --> 27:14.120]  Yeah, this is the way to go, man.
[27:14.680 --> 27:15.760]  Gavin nicknames us.
[27:16.320 --> 27:20.360]  And next, we go with Jeff, who is Doggy G, or G-Dog.
[27:21.360 --> 27:22.400]  We could do this every year.
[27:22.400 --> 27:22.560]  Boss Dog.
[27:22.980 --> 27:23.380]  Absolutely.
[27:23.880 --> 27:24.500]  Yeah, absolutely.
[27:24.880 --> 27:25.680]  Baby Pepsi.
[27:27.680 --> 27:28.480]  And Geezer.
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.300]  Randomize six times.
[27:31.420 --> 27:33.780]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[27:33.900 --> 27:36.080]  Jeff, are you ready to learn your 2025 nickname?
[27:36.420 --> 27:36.980]  Here we go!
[27:36.980 --> 27:38.600]  Fingers crossed for Baby Pepsi.
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.760]  Oh my god.
[27:42.260 --> 27:43.440]  Oh yeah, come on, baby!
[27:43.620 --> 27:45.160]  Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[27:45.460 --> 27:50.100]  And for 2025, Jeff will be known as Baby Pepsi!
[27:52.520 --> 27:52.960]  Wow.
[27:54.120 --> 27:56.460]  How you feeling about Baby Pepsi, Baby Pepsi?
[27:56.600 --> 27:57.380]  I love it.
[27:57.400 --> 27:57.840]  It's the one...
[27:57.840 --> 27:59.700]  I would have been happy with any of them, but that was my favorite.
[27:59.800 --> 28:00.320]  That was my choice.
[28:00.320 --> 28:00.680]  Awesome.
[28:01.340 --> 28:04.280]  Well, we finally go to Gavin and his nicknames.
[28:04.840 --> 28:07.040]  Jurgassi Goo, Free Bird.
[28:07.200 --> 28:08.060]  Really like that one.
[28:08.380 --> 28:09.620]  Really like a little spooky.
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.960]  And finally, the meanest name on the whole thing, Dance Friend.
[28:15.160 --> 28:16.320]  Randomize six times.
[28:17.300 --> 28:20.260]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[28:20.360 --> 28:21.680]  And we begin the spin!
[28:22.420 --> 28:23.380]  Here we go!
[28:23.560 --> 28:25.840]  God, if you exist, please give me Dance Friend.
[28:26.760 --> 28:27.300]  No!
[28:27.800 --> 28:28.640]  Jurgassi Goo!
[28:29.320 --> 28:29.940]  Jurgassi Goo!
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.180]  Jurgassi Goo for 2025!
[28:34.080 --> 28:37.180]  We have a winner, and it's Jurgassi Goo.
[28:38.880 --> 28:42.560]  I think it's really funny that Gavin is getting called Jurgassi Goo for a year
[28:42.560 --> 28:45.860]  because he took a long shit before one recording.
[28:46.560 --> 28:48.560]  No, he's done it several times now.
[28:48.640 --> 28:50.440]  He's shot the recordings full of air.
[28:50.820 --> 28:51.240]  There you go.
[28:51.260 --> 28:52.980]  This is like the fifth or sixth time, to be fair.
[28:53.140 --> 28:56.740]  It is, but he came up with it while Gavin was shitting, so.
[28:56.820 --> 28:57.580]  Yeah, that's true.
[28:57.660 --> 28:57.980]  I did.
[28:57.980 --> 28:59.760]  Well, there you have it.
[28:59.960 --> 29:01.840]  The Nicknames Draft is complete.
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.200]  Let's go one by one.
[29:03.400 --> 29:07.020]  Let's talk about it real quick and wrap this up.
[29:07.260 --> 29:10.100]  Nick, you will be the mechanic for 2025.
[29:10.440 --> 29:10.940]  How are you feeling?
[29:11.340 --> 29:11.840]  I feel great.
[29:11.960 --> 29:12.120]  Yeah?
[29:12.200 --> 29:12.800]  That's fantastic.
[29:13.080 --> 29:13.880]  Yeah, easy going.
[29:14.220 --> 29:15.080]  It makes me sound cool.
[29:15.220 --> 29:15.480]  I'm in.
[29:15.660 --> 29:15.920]  Okay.
[29:15.920 --> 29:16.260]  Let's do it.
[29:16.520 --> 29:19.840]  It's like someone that people would get into a heist, maybe.
[29:20.740 --> 29:21.140]  No!
[29:22.920 --> 29:23.760]  That's pretty good.
[29:23.900 --> 29:24.180]  Gotta bring him.
[29:24.700 --> 29:24.920]  Yep.
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.060]  Andrew, for 2025, you'll be known as Gizmo.
[29:28.460 --> 29:29.260]  How are you feeling about that?
[29:29.640 --> 29:30.220]  I like it.
[29:30.280 --> 29:32.260]  It's not something I've ever been called.
[29:32.400 --> 29:35.520]  It's probably going to take a while to get used to being called Gizmo.
[29:35.820 --> 29:39.100]  I think it'll be sort of like when you adopt a dog and try to change their name.
[29:39.520 --> 29:44.040]  You may be saying it to me and I'm just not going to react initially, but we'll get there.
[29:44.340 --> 29:44.540]  Yeah.
[29:44.840 --> 29:45.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:45.460 --> 29:46.180]  I feel good about it.
[29:46.180 --> 29:46.640]  I like Gizmo.
[29:47.100 --> 29:50.040]  I got Lil Ricky B, which honestly, I'm good with.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.260]  I live a Lil Ricky B.
[29:51.400 --> 29:51.880]  I like that.
[29:51.880 --> 29:55.260]  It's a longer name than my name, but I think it's fun.
[29:55.400 --> 29:56.960]  Everyone's like, oh shit, Lil Ricky B.
[29:57.280 --> 29:59.920]  I mean, you can shorten it to whichever combination you want.
[29:59.980 --> 30:00.760]  Just be Ricky or...
[30:01.540 --> 30:02.560]  It could be Lil Rick.
[30:02.800 --> 30:03.460]  Be like Lil B.
[30:03.820 --> 30:04.420]  Lil Rick!
[30:04.460 --> 30:04.800]  Yeah, whatever.
[30:07.060 --> 30:08.000]  I like it.
[30:08.060 --> 30:09.080]  People call me Ricky B.
[30:09.180 --> 30:10.000]  People call me B.
[30:10.340 --> 30:12.120]  I think it works all the way.
[30:12.600 --> 30:14.100]  Nicknames are living documents.
[30:14.420 --> 30:14.820]  They...
[30:15.100 --> 30:15.260]  Yeah.
[30:15.280 --> 30:15.680]  Exactly.
[30:16.220 --> 30:18.580]  And Jeff, you got Baby Pepsi.
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.320]  How are you feeling about it?
[30:19.340 --> 30:19.560]  I did.
[30:19.640 --> 30:21.260]  I feel so fucking good about Baby Pepsi.
[30:21.260 --> 30:22.640]  I want a t-shirt that says it.
[30:23.660 --> 30:23.980]  Dude.
[30:24.180 --> 30:28.340]  Oh, should we do one of those t-shirts that's like the name, the name, the name, the name?
[30:28.760 --> 30:30.280]  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:30.500 --> 30:31.860]  Hey, let me practice real fast.
[30:31.920 --> 30:32.920]  Let me see what it sounds like.
[30:33.020 --> 30:37.420]  Because I won't be able to do this in the podcast until after this episode comes out, right?
[30:37.480 --> 30:38.740]  Because we don't want to spoil our nicknames, right?
[30:38.740 --> 30:38.840]  Yep.
[30:39.760 --> 30:42.680]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[30:42.980 --> 30:44.440]  My name is...
[30:44.440 --> 30:45.400]  Fuck, I already forgot my name.
[30:46.120 --> 30:48.560]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[30:48.800 --> 30:49.900]  My name is Baby Pepsi.
[30:49.900 --> 30:54.900]  And with me, as always, Lil Ricky B, the mechanic, Gizmo, and Gassy Goo.
[30:55.180 --> 30:56.200]  How's it going today, boys?
[30:56.660 --> 30:57.820]  Dude, that's pretty good.
[30:58.180 --> 30:58.960]  That's pretty good.
[30:58.960 --> 31:00.800]  That sounds like the beginning of a good podcast.
[31:00.920 --> 31:05.400]  Well, it sounds like the beginning of a podcast I wouldn't personally like listen to if somebody
[31:05.400 --> 31:06.800]  said, this is Gassy Goo.
[31:07.620 --> 31:10.600]  But you know, how are you feeling about that nickname, Gassy Goo?
[31:11.420 --> 31:12.480]  Let me look at the other ones.
[31:12.540 --> 31:13.900]  Yeah, I think it's, I think it's perfect.
[31:14.120 --> 31:16.860]  I'm obviously very glad that it wasn't the last one.
[31:17.280 --> 31:18.660]  A little spooky would have been interesting.
[31:18.660 --> 31:21.440]  I think I would have struggled to explain why when people asked.
[31:23.120 --> 31:24.080]  I'm happy with it.
[31:24.780 --> 31:29.200]  So if it had gone as bad as possible, it would have been like this.
[31:29.520 --> 31:32.420]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[31:32.960 --> 31:33.920]  My name is Geezer.
[31:34.120 --> 31:40.760]  And with me, as always, Schwartwave, the Herman Plumbum, Lil Trump, and Dan's friend.
[31:41.100 --> 31:43.880]  Dude, Andrew didn't want Andy Pants.
[31:44.580 --> 31:46.460]  Yeah, that's tough.
[31:46.460 --> 31:53.360]  But my thinking behind the nicknames was, uh, I tried to lean into some stuff where
[31:53.360 --> 31:55.140]  people go like, why is your nickname that?
[31:55.380 --> 31:56.520]  And then you have to go.
[31:57.780 --> 31:59.140]  So we had to do like a draft.
[31:59.200 --> 32:02.440]  I don't really know why my nickname is Showbiz.
[32:02.440 --> 32:03.020]  That's how I got to explain.
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.840]  A little spooky.
[32:06.900 --> 32:08.880]  But Gassy Goo, way to go.
[32:09.020 --> 32:09.460]  That's good.
[32:09.540 --> 32:11.220]  Guys, the nickname draft.
[32:11.440 --> 32:13.980]  Let us know which nicknames are the strongest.
