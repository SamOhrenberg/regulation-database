[00:07.000 --> 00:10.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,
[00:10.960 --> 00:14.180]  with mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea,
[00:14.500 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[00:19.680 --> 00:24.280]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.100]  This is the new Star of the Seas. Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.380]  Is my line fatter?
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.100]  Fat lines.
[00:33.640 --> 00:34.500]  You got a big fat line?
[00:34.780 --> 00:36.040]  I got like fat silence.
[00:37.060 --> 00:38.020]  Fat lines.
[00:39.340 --> 00:41.340]  Like normally silence is skinny.
[00:42.260 --> 00:44.760]  Do you need to take a minute to look at your fat silence?
[00:45.520 --> 00:45.760]  Yeah.
[00:47.000 --> 00:47.480]  No.
[00:48.900 --> 00:49.140]  Okay.
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.280]  Just concerned with it out loud, but then asked if we want to fix it. No. Cool. Right on.
[00:55.400 --> 00:59.820]  Because technically the podcast hasn't started yet. Now would be the time to fix it.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.920]  It's way easier to fix it before we record than after.
[01:05.120 --> 01:10.560]  When I expand it, it's skinny still. But when it's normal size, it's fat.
[01:12.780 --> 01:15.880]  Which do you normally record in? The skinny or the big one?
[01:16.920 --> 01:17.500]  Full size.
[01:18.060 --> 01:19.720]  Well, usually it's small.
[01:20.560 --> 01:20.820]  Okay.
[01:21.760 --> 01:24.360]  You heard him say that and you said okay?
[01:25.460 --> 01:26.300]  Okay, it's fine.
[01:27.380 --> 01:27.800]  Oh, okay.
[01:28.020 --> 01:28.820]  Said it very reluctantly.
[01:28.820 --> 01:33.620]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 46.
[01:33.900 --> 01:39.060]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[01:39.780 --> 01:40.220]  How's everyone doing?
[01:40.600 --> 01:43.280]  Meg is no longer an Andrew sympathizer.
[01:43.680 --> 01:46.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I said that.
[01:46.700 --> 01:47.280]  I figured that was happening.
[01:47.560 --> 01:48.220]  I said that.
[01:48.840 --> 01:50.240]  Andrew predicted correctly.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.320]  I think that was a reasonable episode to come into.
[01:55.640 --> 01:58.800]  I've been adding to a list of places that you lost her.
[02:01.440 --> 02:01.880]  Including...
[02:01.880 --> 02:04.040]  White chocolate is for assholes.
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.920]  Monkey movies are good.
[02:08.180 --> 02:10.140]  And wiping standing up.
[02:10.740 --> 02:11.760]  Monkey movies are good.
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.780]  She's wrong about that one.
[02:15.320 --> 02:16.080]  Not being good.
[02:16.600 --> 02:17.500]  Monkey movies are great.
[02:17.980 --> 02:20.380]  Yeah, I remember Project X with Matthew Broderick. That was a great film.
[02:20.720 --> 02:23.000]  She was also really excited to listen to...
[02:24.140 --> 02:26.040]  watch a lot of Dunstan Checks In.
[02:26.240 --> 02:28.560]  And then I had to break the news that we never actually did that.
[02:28.560 --> 02:30.440]  Oh, we didn't?
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.880]  It's so funny.
[02:32.560 --> 02:36.520]  Yeah, I was talking to Meg over the weekend and I asked her if she could just keep a list of
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.240]  all the things we said we were going to do that we never did for us.
[02:41.480 --> 02:43.120]  Maybe revisit it at some point.
[02:45.340 --> 02:47.100]  The Planet of the Apes movies alone.
[02:47.940 --> 02:48.820]  Space chimps.
[02:49.200 --> 02:50.560]  Those don't count. Those don't count.
[02:50.700 --> 02:52.500]  What do you mean the Planet of the Apes movies don't count?
[02:52.620 --> 02:54.080]  They're the most monkey movies ever.
[02:54.080 --> 02:59.140]  Of all of all the stuff that she said that she doesn't sympathize with you
[02:59.140 --> 03:01.980]  about or whatever, like she had like a change of heart.
[03:02.060 --> 03:05.020]  The monkey movie is the thing that's like really tripping you up, man.
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.700]  Well, because I think it's the worst take.
[03:07.060 --> 03:11.600]  I think my other takes I could see, not like a monkey movies, it's crazy.
[03:14.340 --> 03:15.660]  That is the hill I will die on.
[03:16.200 --> 03:16.840]  MVP 2.
[03:17.220 --> 03:18.640]  The MVP 2 alone.
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.600]  Forget Dunstan Checks In.
[03:21.100 --> 03:22.140]  That's the watch alone.
[03:22.620 --> 03:23.400]  Classic film.
[03:23.400 --> 03:26.300]  What was the Amy Wants Raindrop Drink movie?
[03:26.640 --> 03:28.760]  That was with the white gorillas.
[03:29.540 --> 03:30.600]  Michael Crichton's Congo.
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.580]  Yeah, that was a good one, too.
[03:32.660 --> 03:33.620]  I never saw that one.
[03:34.020 --> 03:40.460]  Yeah, the Amy was the gorilla and she drank martinis to calm down on stressful flights
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.940]  because she wasn't a good flyer.
[03:42.680 --> 03:44.360]  She called it a raindrop drink.
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.580]  She could do sign language.
[03:48.700 --> 03:49.400]  My audio.
[03:49.980 --> 03:51.700]  Oh, what happened?
[03:51.700 --> 03:54.280]  I think my computer is pulling apart.
[03:54.460 --> 03:54.920]  Hold on.
[03:55.720 --> 03:55.960]  What?
[03:56.660 --> 03:59.140]  But we did a whole thing about how you said everything was fine.
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.360]  So now I don't think I don't think that was in the episode.
[04:02.500 --> 04:03.840]  I feel like we probably didn't know.
[04:03.960 --> 04:06.200]  Yeah, it has to be now.
[04:06.780 --> 04:07.900]  Yeah, good job, Gavin.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.700]  We begged him, right?
[04:09.980 --> 04:10.680]  We begged him.
[04:11.340 --> 04:14.240]  And Gavin is the most technically adept of all of us.
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.960]  Hey, especially after fucking Mario Party March today and how long we had to spend on
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.880]  Andrew's goddamn computer.
[04:22.580 --> 04:23.780]  Like, why are we?
[04:24.460 --> 04:28.120]  It's been weird, too, because Andrew's computer has gotten progress.
[04:28.220 --> 04:32.000]  I don't know if you've noticed it, but it's gotten progressively worse every day for about
[04:32.000 --> 04:32.800]  four days.
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.220]  I thought yesterday was the worst, but today he just wasn't there.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.440]  Just wasn't working.
[04:38.900 --> 04:40.440]  Things are just getting worse every day.
[04:40.460 --> 04:41.980]  And then for Gavin on top of it.
[04:42.480 --> 04:42.740]  Wow.
[04:43.020 --> 04:48.800]  I still think it's crazy that you reformatted in the middle of the week on day 21 of Mario
[04:48.800 --> 04:49.380]  Party.
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.300]  Because my computer kept blue screening constantly.
[04:53.020 --> 04:53.840]  Test, test, test.
[04:54.400 --> 04:56.820]  Oh, hey, look, he's back.
[04:57.200 --> 04:57.320]  He's back.
[05:03.700 --> 05:04.740]  Sounds fine.
[05:05.200 --> 05:07.260]  It crashed for a completely different problem.
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.800]  Oh, what was your problem?
[05:09.420 --> 05:14.640]  It said there's too much shit open on my computer, so it dropped out and there's nothing else
[05:14.640 --> 05:16.340]  open apart from Discord and Audacity.
[05:17.020 --> 05:19.800]  Could it be the million of files that you have saved?
[05:19.860 --> 05:21.020]  All the files you keep?
[05:21.020 --> 05:22.880]  All the things you like to store?
[05:23.560 --> 05:24.880]  You think I store them on my computer?
[05:25.520 --> 05:27.220]  Oh, you're storing them somewhere.
[05:27.580 --> 05:29.240]  Yeah, on different drives.
[05:29.960 --> 05:30.280]  Okay.
[05:31.520 --> 05:32.700]  You're storing them?
[05:32.700 --> 05:36.120]  I know you got them just swirled away, man.
[05:36.280 --> 05:36.660]  I do.
[05:37.180 --> 05:38.580]  Gavin's a big file guy.
[05:38.940 --> 05:40.880]  He loves storing them files.
[05:41.540 --> 05:42.660]  Well, here's here's a secret.
[05:42.760 --> 05:44.360]  You should also be a big file guy.
[05:44.760 --> 05:45.860]  Nah, don't need it.
[05:45.860 --> 05:47.620]  You should also have all the files you've made.
[05:47.680 --> 05:48.060]  Don't need it.
[05:48.340 --> 05:49.140]  Don't need it.
[05:49.140 --> 05:52.140]  We literally needed it for F*** Face season one and two.
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.240]  Well, yeah, because we the company we work for got shut down.
[05:56.700 --> 05:58.980]  Do you think we're going to get shut down and then start over?
[05:59.180 --> 06:02.500]  If we get shut down, there's no starting over at this point.
[06:02.520 --> 06:03.800]  What's it got to do with getting shut down?
[06:03.880 --> 06:04.660]  They were your files.
[06:05.280 --> 06:07.540]  Because we lost the things.
[06:07.800 --> 06:08.860]  We lost the ability.
[06:08.920 --> 06:10.060]  We had to make a new feed.
[06:10.180 --> 06:11.880]  So we needed these files.
[06:12.060 --> 06:13.660]  We're not going to need a new feed again.
[06:13.900 --> 06:14.860]  Don't need the files.
[06:16.200 --> 06:17.800]  The files were on my computer.
[06:18.420 --> 06:23.180]  What's the difference between this and you not wanting to do a f***ing five count at the end?
[06:23.280 --> 06:24.500]  It's the same logic.
[06:24.760 --> 06:28.500]  It's a case of an insane scenario playing out.
[06:28.800 --> 06:29.900]  No purpose whatsoever.
[06:30.340 --> 06:32.000]  Yours serves no purpose whatsoever.
[06:32.300 --> 06:34.200]  If we lose this, we're done.
[06:34.580 --> 06:37.080]  That's like saying, why is it when we stop recording?
[06:37.400 --> 06:40.660]  Don't we spin around three times in our chair and do a little fart?
[06:40.760 --> 06:41.700]  Because it's pointless.
[06:41.880 --> 06:43.520]  It doesn't help the process in any way.
[06:44.340 --> 06:50.100]  You say that, but if that was a file, you would back that f***ing thing up until the end of time.
[06:50.120 --> 06:51.260]  What do you mean if it was a file?
[06:51.380 --> 06:52.660]  What does that even mean if it was a file?
[06:52.740 --> 06:56.400]  If it was a file, if it was something you could save, if it was something that was savable,
[06:56.700 --> 07:01.980]  you would save that s*** until D-Day or T-Day or whenever the Terminators come.
[07:02.420 --> 07:03.200]  It's not D-Day.
[07:03.280 --> 07:04.500]  D-Day was a different thing.
[07:05.120 --> 07:06.400]  When would E-Day?
[07:07.340 --> 07:08.400]  That gear's a war.
[07:08.520 --> 07:09.180]  God damn it.
[07:10.380 --> 07:12.480]  One of the days that has a letter in it.
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.100]  While we're arguing, I need to think again at the end, Nick, by the way.
[07:16.260 --> 07:23.040]  While we're arguing, the whole worms debate of how I knew it was a six player game.
[07:25.840 --> 07:26.120]  Go ahead.
[07:26.700 --> 07:27.380]  Yeah, go on.
[07:27.480 --> 07:27.720]  Go ahead.
[07:27.960 --> 07:29.220]  Was that a serious argument?
[07:29.720 --> 07:30.680]  Of course it was.
[07:32.520 --> 07:33.640]  Because the... calm down.
[07:33.980 --> 07:35.420]  You don't understand the argument.
[07:35.800 --> 07:38.780]  The argument was that it's wild that you never brought up
[07:38.780 --> 07:41.720]  in a scenario in which we were sitting people out that we could all play.
[07:42.480 --> 07:46.060]  Not that I think we take responsibility for not knowing.
[07:46.440 --> 07:47.680]  We should have known then.
[07:47.960 --> 07:50.860]  But it is wild that you never articulated.
[07:51.160 --> 07:51.540]  Correct.
[07:51.760 --> 07:52.900]  No, at any point.
[07:52.900 --> 07:53.200]  And I'll tell you why.
[07:53.420 --> 07:53.920]  No, it isn't.
[07:54.220 --> 07:54.500]  What?
[07:55.100 --> 07:59.560]  The first time when we started, when we took over the Let's Play channel, right?
[08:00.060 --> 08:03.120]  It was Jeff, Andrew, Gavin doing stuff.
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.180]  We needed a fourth just to get someone in for worms.
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.860]  And then Nick and Gracie didn't play.
[08:11.580 --> 08:11.920]  Why not?
[08:13.240 --> 08:14.960]  Didn't didn't need that many people.
[08:15.600 --> 08:16.300]  I don't...
[08:16.300 --> 08:17.540]  What? Hang on.
[08:17.600 --> 08:20.760]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:21.620 --> 08:23.540]  Andrew, Andrew, I want Gavin to keep going.
[08:23.700 --> 08:27.180]  I need to know what comes next and what the fuck he's talking about.
[08:27.180 --> 08:28.640]  We didn't sit someone out.
[08:28.880 --> 08:31.520]  We needed someone to step in for the fourth.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.280]  That's not true. Nick was part of it from the beginning.
[08:33.620 --> 08:34.760]  Eric was part of it from the beginning.
[08:35.720 --> 08:36.420]  There's a video.
[08:36.580 --> 08:39.140]  Just Nick and I doing Texas Chainsaw Massacre together.
[08:39.340 --> 08:39.920]  Just him and I.
[08:39.920 --> 08:40.500]  Oh, I get that.
[08:40.500 --> 08:43.600]  The first video, the first video of the new channel was worms.
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.360]  Well, the first video of the new channel was a Halo 2 thing that you and I did that you never put out.
[08:49.660 --> 08:50.740]  That wasn't the first video.
[08:53.140 --> 08:54.820]  It started as the three of us.
[08:54.840 --> 08:55.980]  It was one of the first recorded ones.
[08:56.180 --> 08:58.160]  It started as the three of us playing worms.
[08:58.320 --> 09:00.060]  We needed a fourth because three is slightly too many.
[09:00.580 --> 09:01.460]  Eric stepped in.
[09:01.680 --> 09:02.800]  Nick was fine sitting out.
[09:02.960 --> 09:04.100]  Gracie was fine sitting out.
[09:04.260 --> 09:04.420]  Right?
[09:05.500 --> 09:07.680]  The next game of worms, I wasn't there.
[09:08.060 --> 09:09.000]  So it was everyone else.
[09:09.360 --> 09:09.780]  Four again.
[09:11.360 --> 09:12.240]  They're definitely...
[09:12.240 --> 09:12.500]  Jeff!
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.280]  Knew that there were five people in worms because he's been in a five player worm.
[09:16.380 --> 09:20.400]  So there's no there's no proof that I have actually been in a five player worms.
[09:20.520 --> 09:23.780]  The five player worms that keeps getting brought up was Trevor on my account.
[09:23.980 --> 09:25.100]  That's been debunked clearly.
[09:25.120 --> 09:27.640]  There was a six player worms that Trevor was on your account.
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.020]  There was a five player worms where we were showing Fiona worms.
[09:32.340 --> 09:34.060]  Okay, well, you know what?
[09:34.160 --> 09:40.400]  I'll concede that I may have at one point in my life played one five player game of worms.
[09:40.500 --> 09:45.420]  Across the hundred thousand hours of video games that I played professionally,
[09:45.660 --> 09:50.220]  sometimes six to, I don't know, 10 hours a day, five to six days a week for...
[09:50.220 --> 09:50.900]  I mean, I did that too.
[09:50.920 --> 09:51.980]  Oh, about two decades.
[09:53.340 --> 09:57.140]  And then I left about four or five years before you did.
[09:57.220 --> 10:00.240]  And you continued to be in multiple six player worms videos.
[10:00.380 --> 10:02.380]  But that's not even really what I want to talk about.
[10:02.440 --> 10:04.900]  What I wanted to step in and say, I think this is a...
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.060]  Guys, if everybody takes a step back,
[10:08.060 --> 10:11.500]  take a 10,000 foot view of what just happened.
[10:12.080 --> 10:19.880]  This was a superb act of deflection and gaslighting by Gavin to take us so far down the road,
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.720]  so far off the path of the original issue,
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.180]  which is that Gavin refused to fix his fucking computer problem before we started recording.
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.020]  And we begged, we literally on...
[10:31.020 --> 10:33.720]  And you're going to hear it because we recorded it, begged him to do it.
[10:33.820 --> 10:35.320]  Then his computer crashed.
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.120]  Then in the height of Gavin being at the wrongest of the wrong,
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.980]  he somehow flipped the script and is arguing a worms issue from five fucking videos ago.
[10:45.220 --> 10:48.280]  Oh, I just figured while we were arguing, I would argue about the thing I wanted to argue.
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.080]  We can go back to me and my computer if you want, but just know this.
[10:54.500 --> 10:59.500]  At no point in any of the videos I was in, were we scrambling to fit a fifth person in.
[11:00.260 --> 11:03.000]  You know what I think is interesting is Gavin likes to keep every file,
[11:03.100 --> 11:04.400]  but he doesn't like to upload them.
[11:04.820 --> 11:06.160]  That's what I think is interesting.
[11:08.820 --> 11:12.320]  Because I uploaded all my Mario Party files this week, but you uploaded
[11:12.320 --> 11:19.260]  an audio file that was just the game music instead of your voice.
[11:19.580 --> 11:20.460]  So I did today.
[11:21.520 --> 11:22.300]  What was that about?
[11:22.400 --> 11:25.020]  Today? I don't even know what you're talking about.
[11:25.180 --> 11:28.000]  Well, didn't we have to use Craig last like a few turns ago?
[11:28.420 --> 11:31.520]  Oh yeah, but that's because my computer is failing as we established.
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.940]  I feel like what we can really point out and look at here is that all of the problems are
[11:40.940 --> 11:46.100]  Andrew and Gavin and Nick and Eric and I are sitting back with our feet up clean as can be.
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.880]  Yeah, I got no problem not being the problem. That's never been an issue for me.
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.160]  We had to mute you at a video this week because your mixer wasn't working.
[11:55.780 --> 11:56.580]  You had to mute?
[11:57.080 --> 11:58.680]  Oh, that is true.
[11:59.540 --> 12:00.780]  You turned into a robot.
[12:00.820 --> 12:04.160]  There you go. That's great. Well, so far Mario Party March has been
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.820]  the third time I've ever been late to anything for this entire company and the first time I've
[12:08.820 --> 12:11.340]  had an audio issue. So, you know, there you have it.
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.900]  Also, Eric, you're not the only one who's been late. Nick is... Eric? What? Who? What? Jeff?
[12:17.300 --> 12:23.540]  I was late and also Andrew was late. So you're in good company.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.840]  I've seen people fumble their way through names before getting to the correct one,
[12:26.920 --> 12:28.200]  but never for their own name.
[12:28.560 --> 12:30.540]  That was Jeff. Whoa, dude.
[12:30.900 --> 12:32.960]  I couldn't get to Andrew so I had to go to me.
[12:34.320 --> 12:38.860]  Jeff was so busy pointing fingers everywhere else they couldn't get him to come back around.
[12:42.440 --> 12:43.860]  All right, I can be done arguing.
[12:45.120 --> 12:45.540]  Yeah, I'm good.
[12:46.320 --> 12:49.400]  But I wasn't... how do I know if I'm gatekeeping information?
[12:52.580 --> 12:57.840]  Because I... all of the things that I know are the things that I know. How do I know what you don't
[12:57.840 --> 12:59.220]  know? Ask us?
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.140]  Well, no, it's just there were... you were in videos. You've been in content with worms in
[13:03.140 --> 13:04.980]  which we sat people out and you didn't...
[13:06.060 --> 13:06.720]  The first one.
[13:06.780 --> 13:07.400]  The first one we didn't.
[13:07.520 --> 13:09.920]  The first one wasn't sitting anyone out. It was bringing in a fourth.
[13:09.940 --> 13:12.240]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. When we're doing regulation stuff.
[13:12.840 --> 13:14.740]  You talked about how Nick and Gracie sat out.
[13:15.180 --> 13:16.040]  You said those words.
[13:16.440 --> 13:18.040]  But you were also sitting out.
[13:18.380 --> 13:22.020]  You were sitting out too until we said we need a fourth and you said, I'll do it.
[13:22.540 --> 13:23.180]  But we could have had a sixth.
[13:23.200 --> 13:24.120]  Yeah, you could have had a sixth.
[13:24.740 --> 13:28.840]  We could have. But were we going to put Gracie in worms? She never played it.
[13:30.160 --> 13:30.880]  Neither did Eric.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.560]  I had never played worms.
[13:33.680 --> 13:34.920]  Nick had never played it.
[13:35.280 --> 13:36.180]  Well, I think that was the argument.
[13:36.260 --> 13:38.920]  No one's played it. So we just need one person to step up.
[13:38.940 --> 13:39.740]  What argument are you making?
[13:41.200 --> 13:44.220]  The argument was we weren't trying to squeeze six in.
[13:44.280 --> 13:45.740]  We were trying to get four.
[13:46.360 --> 13:48.400]  Jeff, what is he deflecting from now?
[13:48.660 --> 13:49.700]  I don't know, man.
[13:49.820 --> 13:54.600]  This is like in the old days when Sal, the stockbroker, would call two Chinese food
[13:54.600 --> 13:57.640]  restaurants and have them talk on the phone and try to place orders with each other.
[13:57.860 --> 14:01.060]  And you just can't under... you can't follow the logic of what's being said.
[14:01.420 --> 14:02.020]  I have no idea.
[14:02.020 --> 14:05.180]  I feel like Gavin's arguing against himself and for himself at the same time.
[14:05.240 --> 14:07.300]  How am I supposed to know what you don't know?
[14:07.920 --> 14:09.680]  That's my overall... that's my overall point.
[14:10.480 --> 14:14.920]  My point is that it's just you've been in videos in which we reduce the four.
[14:15.580 --> 14:17.100]  Where we didn't need to.
[14:17.580 --> 14:20.740]  When we started regulation, the regulation, I think the first...
[14:20.740 --> 14:22.120]  Nick, you're saying the first one.
[14:22.340 --> 14:25.080]  I just... that we didn't do that in the first one.
[14:25.240 --> 14:27.060]  And then let's... you're talking let's play.
[14:27.380 --> 14:29.800]  I'm talking when we started regulation gameplay.
[14:29.800 --> 14:30.500]  Okay.
[14:31.560 --> 14:32.660]  I'm... those are the...
[14:32.660 --> 14:33.500]  Okay.
[14:33.800 --> 14:36.140]  He said okay so fast.
[14:36.260 --> 14:36.780]  This is what happens.
[14:37.200 --> 14:39.680]  This is like talking to Nick at 100% eat.
[14:40.120 --> 14:41.320]  This is like... this is insane.
[14:41.680 --> 14:42.840]  I'm pretty sure.
[14:43.100 --> 14:47.140]  And I haven't gone back and checked because this was almost a year ago.
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.980]  But when we're recording like the first Worms content for this channel, I'm pretty sure we
[14:52.980 --> 14:58.520]  only had four people and we had one person swap out based on like who died.
[14:58.520 --> 15:02.820]  There was definitely a system we made where it was either who was whoever was in the last
[15:02.820 --> 15:06.540]  or whoever won had to swap out and you were in those videos.
[15:07.280 --> 15:12.360]  And it's odd that you never vocalized it then because you like to vocalize things.
[15:12.500 --> 15:13.820]  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
[15:13.960 --> 15:14.840]  It could be very helpful.
[15:15.200 --> 15:15.680]  It's a good thing.
[15:15.840 --> 15:16.660]  It's a very good thing.
[15:16.780 --> 15:17.080]  Very helpful.
[15:17.120 --> 15:17.300]  All right.
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.600]  Well, when you when you provide me that video, I'm...
[15:19.600 --> 15:21.720]  No, I don't need to because I'm not the fucking...
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.440]  You need to prove your innocence.
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.900]  I'm not taking you to court.
[15:27.460 --> 15:28.680]  That's what we do on this show.
[15:28.780 --> 15:30.440]  We the first thing we did was take each other to court.
[15:30.440 --> 15:36.880]  You seem to have loved to have gone through every inch of this fucking case outside of now where
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.480]  I've given you an area in which you could be wrong and then you're like, you go dig it up.
[15:41.740 --> 15:43.120]  No, you finish your investigation.
[15:44.100 --> 15:45.100]  But you're the prosecution.
[15:45.720 --> 15:47.180]  I don't care.
[15:47.440 --> 15:48.700]  This is your case.
[15:49.300 --> 15:50.960]  You're the one that's arguing this.
[15:51.080 --> 15:53.360]  I'm willing to say that we should have known.
[15:53.560 --> 15:55.680]  I've always said we should have known.
[15:55.900 --> 15:58.300]  It just was all so crazy that you never...
[15:59.140 --> 15:59.760]  That you did know.
[15:59.780 --> 16:01.020]  Articulated it at that point.
[16:01.820 --> 16:02.800]  That's all I'm saying.
[16:04.520 --> 16:06.420]  And if you want, we can...
[16:06.420 --> 16:09.420]  When you save these files, we can review this in 2046.
[16:10.040 --> 16:11.140]  If you want to go back.
[16:11.620 --> 16:12.400]  Well, that'll be our...
[16:12.400 --> 16:15.400]  That's after we bankrupt twice and we have to redo this again.
[16:16.260 --> 16:19.680]  What would be the new name for Regulation Podcast if we bankrupt?
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.440]  I don't know, Third Time's a Charm?
[16:22.300 --> 16:24.840]  I like Third Time's a Charm a lot.
[16:24.840 --> 16:26.700]  That's a great name on the fly.
[16:28.260 --> 16:29.040]  Well, there you go.
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.980]  Let's fail here so we can succeed there.
[16:31.500 --> 16:32.220]  That's perfect.
[16:33.320 --> 16:36.000]  It's so awesome when these arguments happen.
[16:36.100 --> 16:37.380]  And again, I posted a slider.
[16:37.520 --> 16:38.120]  I'm at a 10.
[16:38.200 --> 16:39.280]  This episode's a 10 for me.
[16:39.320 --> 16:40.100]  I love that.
[16:40.180 --> 16:44.360]  This is Sal asking if he can stay the night at Howard's house.
[16:44.660 --> 16:45.240]  Good to me.
[16:45.660 --> 16:46.540]  Like, this is...
[16:46.540 --> 16:48.780]  To me, these arguments are all timers.
[16:48.860 --> 16:49.980]  I'm having a great time.
[16:50.100 --> 16:50.840]  I love this.
[16:51.180 --> 16:53.680]  Bet you after Meg listens to this one, she'll be on my side on this one.
[16:53.680 --> 16:57.940]  What I love about this, though, is when Gavin asks a question,
[16:58.120 --> 17:01.580]  he's presented with the answer, and then he says,
[17:01.700 --> 17:06.900]  yeah or okay, and then the argument keeps going.
[17:08.400 --> 17:10.160]  I just don't think I'm right.
[17:10.680 --> 17:12.700]  And for those who aren't on our gameplay stuff,
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.220]  this all came from playing a game of Worms.
[17:15.560 --> 17:16.480]  One person was sitting out.
[17:16.560 --> 17:17.840]  I said, everyone could play.
[17:17.900 --> 17:18.700]  It's a five player game.
[17:18.780 --> 17:21.200]  And I got yelled at for about 20 minutes.
[17:21.360 --> 17:22.620]  Just because we didn't know.
[17:22.620 --> 17:24.160]  Which I think is bollocks.
[17:24.160 --> 17:24.640]  You've gotten yelled at.
[17:24.780 --> 17:26.600]  You've gotten yelled at way more now.
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.040]  Or if you would have just opened your fucking mouth 40 years ago.
[17:30.140 --> 17:30.680]  Yep, that's it.
[17:30.680 --> 17:33.400]  I opened my mouth the first time I thought to open my mouth.
[17:34.720 --> 17:36.440]  Well, think better and faster.
[17:36.940 --> 17:41.680]  No, I think the argument is that it is wild that that was the first time in which you felt.
[17:42.380 --> 17:43.220]  Because we should have known.
[17:43.280 --> 17:43.680]  You're right.
[17:44.120 --> 17:46.100]  I agree with that aspect of it.
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.360]  We're all at fault.
[17:47.960 --> 17:51.760]  Apparently, in my 14, almost 50 years of life,
[17:51.860 --> 17:55.220]  there was about a 27 minute window where I was aware of this, too.
[17:55.340 --> 17:56.820]  I should have definitely remembered that.
[17:57.300 --> 18:01.040]  Jeff forgot that we were doing Mario Party March, like on day 19.
[18:01.060 --> 18:03.020]  He was at his computer.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.380]  I was editing so long, right?
[18:05.380 --> 18:06.600]  Gavin texted me.
[18:07.520 --> 18:10.100]  Well, yeah, because we were all sitting in there going, where the fuck is Jeff?
[18:10.100 --> 18:11.420]  OK, where's Jeff?
[18:11.700 --> 18:13.500]  I text Jeff the word, where?
[18:13.860 --> 18:15.660]  And he replied, where what?
[18:15.660 --> 18:17.720]  And I replied, where you?
[18:20.400 --> 18:21.580]  And I went, ah!
[18:23.300 --> 18:24.820]  And opened a different window.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.680]  Mario Party March has been crazy.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.700]  It has been so much fun.
[18:30.200 --> 18:32.920]  It's also been the worst because I'm so sick of waking up.
[18:33.000 --> 18:33.800]  It's been brutal.
[18:34.680 --> 18:37.060]  There's no break or relief.
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.420]  No, and it's constant.
[18:38.420 --> 18:39.120]  Yep.
[18:40.420 --> 18:45.320]  But the turn when it goes against you and boy, has it gone against me
[18:45.320 --> 18:47.480]  and has it gone against other people?
[18:48.340 --> 18:51.020]  You just spend all day thinking about it.
[18:51.580 --> 18:52.260]  Nick, is that true?
[18:52.780 --> 18:54.080]  I think about it from time to time.
[18:54.680 --> 18:59.220]  Like it just you dwell on it because you can't, you know, if something bad happens,
[18:59.280 --> 19:02.500]  typically in a Mario Party game, you just go on to the next turn and you can
[19:02.500 --> 19:05.200]  immediately start work on digging out of that hole.
[19:05.200 --> 19:09.960]  But if you fuck up and because we're doing it so early every morning,
[19:10.680 --> 19:12.360]  it's just your whole day.
[19:12.440 --> 19:15.020]  It's all, it's all you can think about.
[19:15.300 --> 19:21.080]  It's been such a fun way to play that game that I also never want to do again,
[19:21.580 --> 19:22.680]  at least at that hour.
[19:23.420 --> 19:25.220]  No, no, we have to figure something else out.
[19:25.320 --> 19:28.900]  But at the same time, like, I just don't trust us throughout the day
[19:28.900 --> 19:31.920]  to like not have other things scheduled and whatever.
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.540]  But man, that early recording slot.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.700]  What a jumpstart to your day.
[19:40.660 --> 19:40.860]  Yeah.
[19:41.700 --> 19:42.140]  Wow.
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.740]  You're just going now.
[19:44.940 --> 19:45.520]  It's crazy.
[19:45.940 --> 19:49.680]  You guys don't like the idea I presented the other day where next year we do this again,
[19:49.720 --> 19:52.380]  but we do it twice, 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.680]  Concurrent games running at the same time.
[19:54.820 --> 19:55.820]  No, no.
[19:56.060 --> 19:56.960]  Just double down.
[19:57.600 --> 19:58.460]  I don't want to do it.
[19:58.460 --> 19:59.660]  I really like the 9 p.m. one.
[20:00.480 --> 20:01.580]  I'll sign up for that.
[20:01.920 --> 20:02.240]  Instantly.
[20:02.500 --> 20:04.600]  I told my wife that this morning and she said, that's too easy.
[20:04.740 --> 20:06.640]  You should have to do it at noon and midnight.
[20:06.780 --> 20:08.480]  And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[20:08.500 --> 20:09.800]  I'm OK with that one too.
[20:10.200 --> 20:10.840]  You mean that one?
[20:11.180 --> 20:11.720]  Noon and midnight?
[20:12.080 --> 20:12.260]  Hell yeah.
[20:12.460 --> 20:13.160]  You want to do one at...
[20:14.060 --> 20:14.340]  OK.
[20:16.120 --> 20:17.000]  Hey, are you OK?
[20:17.020 --> 20:18.180]  Hey, Gavin, you OK, man?
[20:18.660 --> 20:21.060]  Well, I'm just trying to think of the time we did a podcast at the beginning
[20:21.060 --> 20:23.060]  of the end of the day, and it was awful, wasn't it?
[20:23.120 --> 20:24.120]  It was a great episode.
[20:24.180 --> 20:24.860]  It sucked.
[20:25.020 --> 20:26.460]  It sucked ass.
[20:26.640 --> 20:30.200]  It sounded like Gavin was about to share information and then thought better of it
[20:30.200 --> 20:32.020]  because he didn't want to get in trouble for sharing it.
[20:34.860 --> 20:37.980]  Oh, Christ.
[20:38.420 --> 20:38.920]  Hey, Fidelity.

[21:32.000 --> 21:33.820]  Hey, speaking of information.
[21:34.080 --> 21:36.800]  So we are doing back-to-backs today, which I'll be honest,
[21:36.940 --> 21:39.140]  stressed me out yesterday because I was looking at my notes
[21:39.140 --> 21:42.620]  and I just have a section of dregs that I've just been pushing off.
[21:42.680 --> 21:43.540]  That's all I've got.
[21:43.680 --> 21:45.220]  Like four little dreg notes.
[21:45.440 --> 21:47.680]  And I thought that could be my contribution to one episode,
[21:47.680 --> 21:49.980]  but I need to come up with some new ideas or something.
[21:50.380 --> 21:52.260]  I was laying in bed, just racking my brain.
[21:52.320 --> 21:53.080]  I couldn't think of anything.
[21:53.160 --> 21:53.840]  So I went to bed.
[21:54.340 --> 21:58.940]  And then the idea fairy came and visited me in my sleep.
[21:59.020 --> 22:02.200]  And when I woke up this morning, I was vomiting ideas.
[22:02.300 --> 22:07.000]  I had five ideas at the same fucking time all at once this morning.
[22:07.280 --> 22:07.640]  Wow.
[22:07.780 --> 22:08.480]  To share with you guys.
[22:08.480 --> 22:10.120]  Like a freestyle machine of ideas.
[22:10.340 --> 22:13.500]  It was like a little machine gun, but it only had five bullets in it,
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.300]  but the succession was rapid.
[22:15.440 --> 22:15.920]  It was like...
[22:16.700 --> 22:17.940]  Even faster than that, maybe.
[22:18.460 --> 22:20.580]  Do they build or are they all like completely unique?
[22:21.000 --> 22:21.560]  I'm going to let...
[22:21.560 --> 22:22.120]  Oh, I think they're...
[22:22.120 --> 22:22.720]  Well, you'll see.
[22:22.800 --> 22:23.740]  Can I share them with you guys?
[22:23.740 --> 22:24.580]  Of course.
[22:24.740 --> 22:24.860]  All right.
[22:24.980 --> 22:26.080]  My first idea.
[22:26.700 --> 22:28.020]  You guys know dart boards, right?
[22:28.240 --> 22:28.500]  Yeah.
[22:28.600 --> 22:28.880]  Yes.
[22:28.980 --> 22:29.880]  You have a dart board.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.520]  It's round.
[22:30.740 --> 22:35.520]  You play the game where you try to get the dart in the middle or strategically around the edges.
[22:35.780 --> 22:36.760]  There's games called cricket.
[22:36.980 --> 22:37.660]  There's just like...
[22:37.660 --> 22:40.180]  But they're dart board games, right?
[22:40.600 --> 22:43.560]  Why don't we have dart board games?
[22:44.040 --> 22:47.820]  Why does a dart board have to be just a circular thing on a wall?
[22:47.900 --> 22:49.160]  Why can't it be much larger?
[22:49.160 --> 22:54.800]  Why can't it be like Candyland and you're throwing darts to go places on the board and then you end
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.600]  up being like, oh, I missed.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.460]  I'm in the fucking...
[22:56.460 --> 22:57.280]  I'm in the swamp.
[22:57.380 --> 22:59.060]  I got to go back three darts or whatever.
[22:59.400 --> 23:00.160]  Why do we...
[23:00.160 --> 23:03.200]  Why can't we innovate on the dart board itself?
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.100]  If people can put pickleball courts in their backyard, if they can build like fucking rock
[23:09.100 --> 23:13.980]  climbing walls in their garage, why can't you dedicate a wall in your garage to a dart board
[23:13.980 --> 23:17.140]  that's wall size that you can create entire board games on?
[23:17.140 --> 23:21.920]  I think we can revolutionize the dart board industry and dart boards, darts as a sport
[23:21.920 --> 23:22.520]  in general.
[23:22.840 --> 23:24.880]  I mean, you got a few dart things.
[23:24.980 --> 23:26.300]  You got lawn darts.
[23:26.780 --> 23:27.780]  You got the dart board.
[23:28.480 --> 23:33.420]  You got the throwing balloons or no, you throw the darts, not the balloons.
[23:33.800 --> 23:34.760]  Now, what about that?
[23:35.020 --> 23:38.400]  What if you had to throw the balloons at the darts?
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.300]  I'm OK with that idea, too.
[23:40.380 --> 23:45.700]  I just think that we we did that thing as a culture and a society where we built a dart
[23:45.700 --> 23:48.500]  board and we went, good enough, and then nobody thought to innovate.
[23:48.900 --> 23:50.060]  And it's just been sitting there.
[23:50.300 --> 23:54.220]  They've just been sitting there collecting dust in every garage in the world.
[23:55.460 --> 23:59.280]  Across the universe, people are ignoring dart boards, but they didn't.
[23:59.360 --> 24:03.860]  They don't have to if we made them a fun shape and added new mechanics to the game.
[24:04.460 --> 24:05.320]  Think about it.
[24:05.440 --> 24:06.080]  That's my first idea.
[24:06.300 --> 24:08.420]  You don't even need to add new mechanics.
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.060]  We can just say it has AI in it because that's what every major company is doing now.
[24:13.060 --> 24:15.900]  AI, dart board, dart board 2.0.
[24:16.620 --> 24:17.840]  What does the AI do?
[24:17.940 --> 24:18.240]  I don't know.
[24:18.320 --> 24:25.000]  I don't understand why every company is fighting so hard after something that I don't know anyone
[24:25.000 --> 24:25.700]  who cares about.
[24:26.140 --> 24:26.480]  Yes.
[24:27.160 --> 24:27.840]  I just got an AI.
[24:28.820 --> 24:29.620]  Look at that.
[24:29.860 --> 24:30.040]  AI.
[24:30.540 --> 24:31.580]  I'm sure people use now.
[24:31.660 --> 24:32.540]  Just who are those people?
[24:33.220 --> 24:37.400]  I can think of a couple of people I know personally that are fucking in love with it.
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.560]  Talk about it constantly.
[24:39.340 --> 24:40.220]  You know one of them.
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.940]  Having AI and stuff?
[24:41.940 --> 24:43.540]  Yeah, and using AI for stuff.
[24:43.920 --> 24:48.680]  I mean, even to this day, you look at stuff like Siri, which is, I assume, over a decade old.
[24:48.960 --> 24:51.360]  I've never used it for anything other than setting a timer.
[24:51.760 --> 24:53.780]  So maybe I'm not the best use case for AI.
[24:54.080 --> 24:58.460]  I finally used Alexa the way you're supposed to the other day, I think.
[24:58.540 --> 25:00.320]  I usually just ask her what the weather is.
[25:00.880 --> 25:03.000]  And sometimes I'll ask her to play a song.
[25:03.380 --> 25:07.840]  But yesterday, I realized I needed to descale my coffee maker.
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.880]  And I couldn't find the descaler since I moved.
[25:11.980 --> 25:13.860]  It's like one of those things you use twice a year, you know?
[25:14.300 --> 25:15.620]  And so I thought, it's like six bucks.
[25:15.660 --> 25:16.340]  I'll just buy more.
[25:16.480 --> 25:17.880]  And I looked at my Alexa and I thought,
[25:18.160 --> 25:20.740]  I bet I could just tell this lady to buy it and she'll buy it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:21.820]  And I did.
[25:21.920 --> 25:22.620]  And she did.
[25:23.480 --> 25:24.720]  I just said, Alexa.
[25:25.200 --> 25:26.400]  Well, she's in the downstairs.
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.820]  I said, Alexa, buy descaler.
[25:28.940 --> 25:29.500]  Coffee descaler.
[25:29.580 --> 25:32.180]  And she goes, you purchased this on October 7th, 2023.
[25:32.340 --> 25:33.420]  Would you like to purchase it again?
[25:33.440 --> 25:34.000]  And I was like, yes.
[25:34.000 --> 25:34.820]  And then she's like, ordered.
[25:34.920 --> 25:35.740]  It will be here Friday.
[25:36.280 --> 25:38.460]  And I was like, why haven't I been doing this for years?
[25:38.520 --> 25:40.870]  I've had this lady in my house for like fucking six years now.
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.040]  Well, you prayed to her.
[25:43.340 --> 25:43.700]  That's true.
[25:43.760 --> 25:44.580]  I did pray to her that time.
[25:45.320 --> 25:47.200]  Anyway, so that was my first idea.
[25:47.800 --> 25:49.760]  Now I have four more ideas I'd like to share with you.
[25:49.960 --> 25:51.100]  Here's my second idea.
[25:51.660 --> 25:52.340]  Hot spoon.
[25:52.960 --> 25:53.600]  Think about it.
[25:53.860 --> 25:59.500]  An electric spoon that also heats your food up while it's heating up on the stove even faster.
[25:59.700 --> 26:00.640]  I thought it might exist.
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.080]  So I have another idea for you.
[26:02.460 --> 26:03.380]  Cold spoon.
[26:03.380 --> 26:06.800]  A spoon that cools things down electrically.
[26:07.920 --> 26:10.940]  Say your soup's too hot and you're like, oh, it's too hot and you got a blow on it.
[26:11.140 --> 26:11.620]  Cold spoon.
[26:13.160 --> 26:18.100]  A decently cool spoon that you put it in that just cools things down so you don't have to blow on them.
[26:18.300 --> 26:21.700]  Or just slightly warms it up if your soup's a little too cold.
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.360]  I mean, could that be done with just like a hollow spoon full of a cooling
[26:25.360 --> 26:26.960]  liquid that you just keep in the freezer?
[26:27.300 --> 26:31.180]  Yeah, in my mind, it's done somehow with watch batteries and electronics.
[26:31.340 --> 26:32.680]  But yeah, it could probably be done that way too.
[26:33.280 --> 26:35.820]  I'm going to take a step back and say I don't know if it's the hot spoon.
[26:35.940 --> 26:41.860]  I think what I was thinking of is they made a spoon that makes it things taste salty.
[26:42.400 --> 26:45.460]  It adds a sodium taste to a salt spoon.
[26:45.840 --> 26:48.440]  Is hot and salt the same to you?
[26:48.720 --> 26:51.380]  No, but I think I just went innovative spoon.
[26:52.120 --> 26:54.740]  But I'm trying to...
[26:54.740 --> 27:00.200]  No, my brain went technology spoon and I immediately went salt spoon.
[27:00.200 --> 27:07.600]  Well, now I'm trying to remember if adding like a salt taste was a side function of the hot spoon.
[27:07.940 --> 27:09.560]  It was at CES this year.
[27:10.040 --> 27:10.980]  What was the spoon?
[27:11.100 --> 27:14.600]  So I invented something this morning that's already at CES this year.
[27:14.720 --> 27:15.900]  I'm like six months too late.
[27:16.320 --> 27:17.220]  That's so close.
[27:17.900 --> 27:20.180]  But it sounds like they didn't bring a cold spoon out.
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.500]  A spoon, salt spoon, CES spoon.
[27:23.400 --> 27:24.820]  Electric salt spoon.
[27:25.580 --> 27:27.120]  Electric salt spoon.
[27:27.120 --> 27:32.140]  Is a tableware type device that enhances the salty and umami taste of low sodium foods
[27:32.140 --> 27:34.000]  with the power of electricity.
[27:34.880 --> 27:37.840]  A weak electric current is passed from the tip of the spoon to the food
[27:37.840 --> 27:39.900]  to enhance the taste of the meal.
[27:40.560 --> 27:43.000]  Now, see if it heated or cooled it, we'd be onto something.
[27:43.460 --> 27:46.640]  But that's the type of spoon you want, Jeff, like visually, right?
[27:46.700 --> 27:48.060]  Like you want a tech spoon.
[27:48.120 --> 27:48.760]  Yeah, yeah, like that, yeah.
[27:49.240 --> 27:51.580]  Does electric in your food make it taste more salty?
[27:52.060 --> 27:53.740]  Apparently, I guess so.
[27:53.900 --> 27:55.420]  And then why don't we just have electric plates?
[27:55.420 --> 27:58.080]  Yeah, is it too, what if it's too electrified?
[27:58.220 --> 28:00.800]  Do you think it would like, it would zap you and be,
[28:00.900 --> 28:01.860]  but like you wouldn't get hurt.
[28:01.960 --> 28:02.760]  It would just be too salty.
[28:02.900 --> 28:03.560]  Oh, too salty.
[28:05.100 --> 28:08.140]  I want food that when I lift it off the plate, there's a small arc.
[28:12.480 --> 28:12.840]  Tangy.
[28:12.980 --> 28:16.460]  What if it's like when you electrocute a pond in a video game?
[28:19.380 --> 28:22.240]  What if there was a condiment fork?
[28:22.700 --> 28:23.060]  Oh.
[28:23.960 --> 28:26.000]  So imagine a ketchup in a fork.
[28:26.180 --> 28:29.280]  You can stab a couple of chip, a couple of fries,
[28:29.780 --> 28:31.540]  a little squirt of ketchup comes out of the fork.
[28:31.820 --> 28:35.060]  Yeah, what if at the end you can squeeze like the tip,
[28:35.200 --> 28:37.780]  you like push on the tip and it squeezes a little at the front,
[28:37.860 --> 28:40.180]  right as it goes in your mouth, so you get like the perfect amount.
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.020]  And that way there's no soggy factor because you're putting ketchup on the chips
[28:44.020 --> 28:45.080]  right at the last minute.
[28:45.520 --> 28:46.280]  I like this.
[28:46.760 --> 28:47.380]  That's interesting.
[28:47.400 --> 28:49.300]  Maybe we should get into the silverware lab.
[28:49.920 --> 28:51.360]  Yeah, it sounds like we really should.
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.880]  We made a forks before.
[28:54.780 --> 28:56.380]  That's true. We made some pretty awesome forks.
[28:56.480 --> 28:58.060]  I'm not giving up on a hot spoon, cold spoon.
[28:58.200 --> 29:01.280]  And I really like the idea of flavor injectable forks.
[29:03.660 --> 29:08.060]  Do you sell canisters or is it like that fork is what it is?
[29:08.140 --> 29:09.440]  And then you have to buy new forks.
[29:09.520 --> 29:12.180]  It should be washable and refillable, I assume.
[29:12.740 --> 29:12.980]  Yeah.
[29:13.280 --> 29:20.780]  Now, unfortunately, a utensil mate has come around and it has...
[29:20.780 --> 29:28.960]  Kickstarter, I just sent an image to the Kickstarter where they were looking for $18,000.
[29:31.100 --> 29:36.420]  Unfortunately, they only reached $2,900 on 54 backers.
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.320]  But this project did not reach its funding goal by August 19th of 2015.
[29:41.380 --> 29:45.520]  So we might be a little behind the times on this one.
[29:45.700 --> 29:46.180]  Everything.
[29:46.640 --> 29:50.760]  Maybe it was an idea ahead of its time and it just needed to be reinvented by
[29:50.760 --> 29:52.300]  the right people at the right time.
[29:52.680 --> 29:53.400]  That looks horrific.
[29:53.540 --> 29:54.920]  That's a terrible picture with the hands.
[29:54.920 --> 29:58.600]  It's a really bad mock up of what that thing would be.
[29:59.140 --> 30:00.720]  Yeah, we can definitely improve upon that.
[30:00.880 --> 30:03.340]  I don't think anything should be visible from the outside like that.
[30:03.440 --> 30:04.580]  I think it can all be done internally.
[30:06.080 --> 30:06.580]  But those...
[30:06.580 --> 30:06.820]  All right.
[30:06.820 --> 30:07.880]  So those are my first three.
[30:08.080 --> 30:10.240]  So far, you got dart board games.
[30:10.620 --> 30:11.680]  You got a hot spoon.
[30:11.780 --> 30:12.560]  You got cold spoon.
[30:12.660 --> 30:14.240]  Are you ready for idea number four?
[30:14.300 --> 30:14.980]  It's a two-parter.
[30:15.380 --> 30:15.760]  Yes.
[30:16.300 --> 30:19.840]  The idea number four, Nick, this idea is specifically for you.
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.000]  I think a lot about where we're going.
[30:22.240 --> 30:24.860]  Andrew mentioned earlier that we're going to go out of business at some point and then
[30:24.860 --> 30:26.500]  form a third time's a charm company.
[30:26.880 --> 30:28.660]  We've got a lot of tumult in our future.
[30:28.820 --> 30:33.520]  But at some point, we will have all accrued enough money and success and age that we can retire.
[30:33.720 --> 30:36.060]  And Nick, I worry about you and your retirement.
[30:36.380 --> 30:37.940]  So here's what I'm going to propose to you.
[30:38.280 --> 30:41.640]  You move to Vermont, huge in the antiquing world in Vermont.
[30:41.860 --> 30:42.880]  You open up your first...
[30:43.580 --> 30:45.860]  This is a franchise idea I've got here.
[30:45.900 --> 30:47.860]  You open up your first antique store.
[30:48.480 --> 30:49.160]  You ready for this?
[30:49.620 --> 30:52.300]  You call it the Nick and Cranny, okay?
[30:52.660 --> 30:56.820]  After that's a huge success and everybody buys their antiques from the Nick and Cranny,
[30:57.080 --> 31:00.360]  you go two towns over, you open up your second shop.
[31:00.920 --> 31:05.040]  It's priced a little lower items, you know, a little bit more accessible as now you've
[31:05.040 --> 31:05.840]  made a name for yourself.
[31:05.980 --> 31:09.660]  People, a lot of people are going to want to come in and buy stuff from the Nick and Cranny,
[31:09.760 --> 31:11.540]  but they're not, not everybody's going to be able to afford it.
[31:11.600 --> 31:13.820]  So you're going to be able to send them to Nick's Snacks.
[31:14.080 --> 31:17.920]  That's your second store, your satellite store, where you're going to sell slightly cheaper
[31:17.920 --> 31:18.300]  stuff.
[31:18.300 --> 31:21.120]  That's my fourth idea, the Nick and Cranny and Nick's Snacks.
[31:21.620 --> 31:22.560]  What about Nick's Snacks?
[31:23.440 --> 31:23.900]  I'm in!
[31:24.220 --> 31:27.180]  All right, and here's my fifth and final idea.
[31:27.480 --> 31:32.980]  I was reading something on a subreddit the other day about somebody bitching about how
[31:32.980 --> 31:40.940]  long it took the police to come to their contested fender bender, right?
[31:41.040 --> 31:43.660]  And they were just like, we're just sitting on the side of the road for like an hour and
[31:43.660 --> 31:47.100]  a half waiting for the cops to show up because of this fender bender.
[31:47.100 --> 31:49.800]  Typically, these days, you exchange information and leave.
[31:49.940 --> 31:53.120]  But whenever there's an issue and people are contesting it or whatever, everybody sticks
[31:53.120 --> 31:53.380]  around.
[31:53.860 --> 31:55.060]  And I was thinking about all those people.
[31:55.140 --> 31:57.420]  This happened to my wife in Houston a couple years ago.
[31:57.860 --> 32:02.000]  Some guy insisted on waiting for the police to come instead of exchanging information.
[32:02.280 --> 32:03.060]  It was a whole thing.
[32:03.180 --> 32:05.140]  And it took over an hour of Emily's time.
[32:05.740 --> 32:08.260]  That got me thinking, you know what those people need?
[32:08.780 --> 32:09.060]  What?
[32:09.420 --> 32:10.980]  Those people need comfort food.
[32:11.340 --> 32:17.080]  They need an Uber that's specific for people in fender benders that are stuck on the side
[32:17.080 --> 32:21.780]  of the interstate in some weird mile marker that's hard to explain to an Uber Eats driver
[32:22.680 --> 32:28.440]  that exists solely to bring food to people stuck in fender benders.
[32:28.640 --> 32:32.360]  We can make a chicken based, we can call it tender bender, and we're going to make a
[32:32.360 --> 32:33.080]  billion dollars.
[32:33.620 --> 32:35.200]  I like tender bender a lot.
[32:35.800 --> 32:36.500]  I like that.
[32:36.540 --> 32:39.560]  Can it be spelled like T-E-N-D-R?
[32:40.040 --> 32:41.100]  B-E-N-D-R?
[32:41.780 --> 32:43.380]  Yeah, this is 2025.
[32:43.740 --> 32:44.820]  We're not going to waste money on vowels.
[32:45.160 --> 32:45.320]  Cool.
[32:45.420 --> 32:45.540]  Good.
[32:45.580 --> 32:46.100]  Thank you.
[32:46.360 --> 32:46.980]  Yeah, no problem.
[32:46.980 --> 32:51.820]  And those are my five ideas that my machine gun ideas that all came to me the second I
[32:51.820 --> 32:52.480]  woke up this morning.
[32:52.560 --> 32:54.460]  And I'm very happy to have shared them all with you.
[32:54.680 --> 32:57.040]  Oh, man, I got a 50% off coupon on tender bender.
[32:57.140 --> 32:58.660]  God damn, I got to get into an accident.
[32:59.300 --> 32:59.660]  Shit.
[33:00.360 --> 33:04.940]  It's it's not one of those things that you look to use, but when you need it, you need
[33:04.940 --> 33:05.300]  it.
[33:05.460 --> 33:07.980]  So they're just driving around listening to the police radio.
[33:08.500 --> 33:09.000]  They could be.
[33:09.120 --> 33:09.700]  Yeah, they could be.
[33:10.160 --> 33:11.000]  I'm open to ideas.
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.140]  I like the idea that that's how they get you to join the app.
[33:16.140 --> 33:20.780]  They show up to your scene and they're like, oh, it's like an ambulance chaser, but they're
[33:20.780 --> 33:25.580]  chicken chasers and they just chase fender benders with nice hot chicken tenders and
[33:25.580 --> 33:25.880]  nuggets.
[33:26.280 --> 33:32.040]  Maybe if the food truck had a towing capacity on the back, it could be a double whammy.
[33:32.160 --> 33:35.680]  Oh, then they can tow you to the main restaurant.
[33:36.940 --> 33:37.340]  Yeah.
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.200]  What if you get towed into the restaurant?
[33:40.700 --> 33:44.440]  Well, what if it what if you take a ride up front while your car's being towed and they
[33:44.440 --> 33:47.520]  just forcefully drive you through the tender bend to drive through?
[33:48.220 --> 33:55.260]  It could be like a reverse food truck where the people stand facing outward and you're
[33:55.260 --> 33:56.200]  in the middle of it.
[33:56.560 --> 33:58.540]  It's like a drive in food truck.
[33:58.820 --> 34:01.720]  I like the idea of a drive through that is on the passenger side.
[34:04.000 --> 34:13.100]  I wonder if there is a if there exists a mechanic shop or auto body shop or minor repair shop
[34:13.100 --> 34:14.500]  sit down restaurant.
[34:15.760 --> 34:21.240]  You go in, you pull in there, you're like, I changed my oil and bang out that fender
[34:21.240 --> 34:26.040]  and I'm going to go in and eat a chicken fried steak and have some iced tea.
[34:26.860 --> 34:27.840]  It's a good combo.
[34:28.640 --> 34:28.980]  I don't.
[34:29.040 --> 34:29.260]  Yeah.
[34:30.320 --> 34:32.840]  Hey, if you work in that environment, let us know.
[34:33.740 --> 34:34.580]  You're the one.
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.960]  If you work in a restaurant or a garage and you think your business could be improved
[34:39.960 --> 34:41.760]  by one or the other, let us know.
[34:41.760 --> 34:46.060]  Would you have to call it something that kind of fit both industries, like the oil can or
[34:46.060 --> 34:46.240]  something?
[34:46.940 --> 34:48.540]  How does that fit the food industry?
[34:49.440 --> 34:49.900]  Wait, what?
[34:50.040 --> 34:50.400]  Hold on.
[34:50.500 --> 34:50.680]  What?
[34:51.460 --> 34:52.120]  What do you mean?
[34:52.280 --> 34:53.080]  The oil can.
[34:53.140 --> 34:54.300]  How does that apply to food?
[34:54.700 --> 34:55.560]  You cook food in oil.
[34:56.600 --> 34:57.000]  Okay.
[34:57.540 --> 34:59.720]  Maybe it's if it's the olive oil can.
[35:00.460 --> 35:00.660]  Yeah.
[35:01.380 --> 35:02.400]  What do you want from me?
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.420]  No, you just you said that like it was so established.
[35:06.600 --> 35:07.420]  I was just curious.
[35:07.620 --> 35:07.900]  I don't know.
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.960]  A neighbor food that's also used in cars.
[35:10.080 --> 35:10.720]  What do you mean?
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.620]  What was your idea?
[35:12.760 --> 35:16.800]  Once again, this is for you to prove and not for me to establish.
[35:17.040 --> 35:18.740]  You don't want to do any of the work today.
[35:19.040 --> 35:19.940]  No, there's nuts.
[35:20.660 --> 35:21.880]  You can do something with nuts.
[35:22.240 --> 35:23.080]  You eat nuts.
[35:23.280 --> 35:23.900]  They're car nuts.
[35:25.180 --> 35:27.480]  I can't believe a car nut's changed.
[35:27.840 --> 35:28.780]  Dude, that's what it is.
[35:29.080 --> 35:30.020]  It's truck nuts.
[35:30.300 --> 35:31.040]  It's truck nuts.
[35:33.860 --> 35:37.140]  We're selling truck nuts, but we're also selling truck nuts.
[35:37.500 --> 35:38.720]  This is awesome.
[35:38.720 --> 35:40.600]  So it would be nut based food.
[35:40.640 --> 35:41.920]  It'd be like a vegetarian place.
[35:42.060 --> 35:45.460]  It's like it's this.
[35:45.600 --> 35:47.100]  It's this but also cashews.
[35:52.520 --> 35:54.660]  This episode's fucking crazy.
[35:55.820 --> 35:57.760]  You can just do cashews on the back of trucks.
[35:57.840 --> 35:59.360]  What if it was also literal nuts?
[36:00.080 --> 36:01.840]  Truck nuts that aren't balls.
[36:02.340 --> 36:04.520]  Should we get into designing?
[36:06.180 --> 36:07.940]  What would you call that?
[36:07.940 --> 36:08.920]  The truck nut?
[36:09.480 --> 36:11.140]  Yeah, but like, what would you call that decoration?
[36:11.720 --> 36:16.260]  Like, oh, like, it's like a trailer, like a hitch decoration.
[36:16.580 --> 36:17.820]  No, it's like a hitch accessory.
[36:18.100 --> 36:18.820]  Yeah, hitch accessory.
[36:18.960 --> 36:21.340]  Should we get into designing like hitch accessories?
[36:21.840 --> 36:22.860]  Like a truck pussy?
[36:23.740 --> 36:28.640]  No, I don't think no one that listens to this show has a hitch.
[36:30.740 --> 36:32.600]  It's not that it's not our audience, man.
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.940]  The road flaps, Nick.
[36:35.800 --> 36:37.540]  Shut up, man, just a truck pussy.
[36:38.780 --> 36:41.740]  Mudflaps, but evolved.
[36:47.640 --> 36:50.360]  Yeah, when I hear hitch, I think of the Will Smith movie.
[36:51.300 --> 36:55.160]  I feel like there's a lot of people out there with truck hitches that just don't want,
[36:55.340 --> 36:59.360]  you know, giant metal silver balls hanging from their truck,
[36:59.400 --> 37:01.840]  but they want to decorate it in some way, you know?
[37:01.840 --> 37:03.820]  Maybe they're less crude.
[37:04.260 --> 37:06.360]  What the hell's that?
[37:07.660 --> 37:10.200]  It's Will Smith after we feed him some truck nuts.
[37:10.300 --> 37:13.740]  That's the, that's the cover, that's the thumbnail for this episode.
[37:14.200 --> 37:17.660]  Will Smith is, Will Smith is allergic to truck nuts.
[37:22.400 --> 37:27.400]  When you search Will Smith hitch, this is the second image that shows up.
[37:27.860 --> 37:29.020]  I've never seen that movie.
[37:29.020 --> 37:30.620]  Me neither.
[37:32.320 --> 37:33.980]  That's something we're going to have to be careful with,
[37:34.080 --> 37:36.020]  is truck nut allergies when we open this restaurant.
[37:36.080 --> 37:37.020]  You got to be really careful.
[37:37.840 --> 37:40.120]  I don't remember that, and I have seen that movie.
[37:41.060 --> 37:41.880]  That's horrific.
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.400]  It is. Dude, when you search Will Smith hitch,
[37:44.540 --> 37:47.920]  that is like the image that shows up over and over and over again.
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.060]  It's just his, his face all fucked up off our truck nuts.
[37:55.140 --> 37:55.580]  Crazy.
[37:56.420 --> 37:56.860]  Wow.
[37:57.560 --> 37:58.000]  Nuts.
[37:59.020 --> 37:59.860]  You want truck nuts?
[37:59.960 --> 38:01.160]  No, I have a nut allergy.
[38:03.160 --> 38:04.300]  That's so stupid.
[38:07.580 --> 38:13.240]  What other truck food are there's not wipers or not a food glass.
[38:14.600 --> 38:17.300]  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[38:18.660 --> 38:19.620]  Hot chairs.
[38:21.700 --> 38:22.180]  Chess.
[38:22.920 --> 38:23.740]  Well, seats.
[38:24.720 --> 38:26.620]  I was trying to think what's in the car.
[38:26.720 --> 38:27.200]  Tires.
[38:28.060 --> 38:28.720]  Candy tires.
[38:29.660 --> 38:30.640]  Steering wheel.
[38:31.060 --> 38:31.500]  Steering.
[38:31.620 --> 38:33.060]  Yeah, no, that doesn't work.
[38:33.520 --> 38:34.580]  Glove box.
[38:38.540 --> 38:40.500]  I've exhausted my ideas.
[38:40.800 --> 38:41.360]  Blinker.
[38:42.260 --> 38:42.820]  Blinker.
[38:43.100 --> 38:45.600]  Yeah, there's no candy named Blinker that I'm aware of.
[38:45.840 --> 38:46.960]  I'm sure there's six in England.
[38:47.520 --> 38:48.360]  There could be.
[38:48.420 --> 38:50.100]  That would be like Blinky Linky.
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.740]  Gavin loves him some Blinky Linky's.
[38:54.740 --> 39:02.060]  I asked Gavin what his what nationality his taste buds think he is.
[39:02.440 --> 39:04.720]  And I was surprised that he still thinks British.
[39:05.700 --> 39:05.720]  Really?
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.760]  Yeah, I think it's just what I grew up on.
[39:09.560 --> 39:14.080]  And I'll be honest, I think food in America looks better than it tastes.
[39:14.740 --> 39:15.540]  I think that's America.
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.820]  America looks better than it tastes.
[39:18.040 --> 39:21.480]  Yeah, I think that veneer is slowly coming off if you really kind of pay attention.
[39:22.920 --> 39:25.360]  I was surprised because you eat American food every day
[39:25.360 --> 39:27.920]  and you've lived in America quite a while at this point.
[39:28.340 --> 39:29.660]  How long have you lived in America?
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.620]  13 years.
[39:32.460 --> 39:32.860]  Wow.
[39:34.120 --> 39:37.760]  And you lived in England for 13 years also, so it's sort of even, right?
[39:38.100 --> 39:38.880]  Yeah, 50-50.
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.400]  I just feel like breakfast here looks tremendous,
[39:42.580 --> 39:44.640]  but it's rarely better than like an English breakfast.
[39:46.140 --> 39:47.500]  I'm not even going to get into this.
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.160]  No, no, get into it.
[39:49.700 --> 39:50.120]  Get into it.
[39:50.120 --> 39:53.880]  You're fucking... the beans for breakfast thing is like,
[39:53.980 --> 39:55.720]  just like not a line I'm going to cross ever.
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.460]  That's so nuts.
[39:56.460 --> 39:57.720]  Did you do it though? Did you try it?
[39:57.940 --> 39:58.080]  Yes.
[39:58.080 --> 39:58.420]  It's pretty good.
[39:58.580 --> 39:59.800]  Yes. No, it's not.
[40:02.880 --> 40:06.080]  What? What do you... did I have an English breakfast?
[40:06.580 --> 40:07.960]  Yeah, but did you have it properly?
[40:09.220 --> 40:12.780]  Yeah, like did you get a bit of sausage, bit of bacon, sort of run it around the beans,
[40:12.880 --> 40:15.320]  like get a good combo of everything and every bite?
[40:15.800 --> 40:16.920]  Bit of brown sauce, bit of daddy's.
[40:18.140 --> 40:18.680]  We're done.
[40:20.880 --> 40:24.760]  Come on, put some daddy... put some daddy's brown sauce in your mouth.
[40:24.940 --> 40:30.100]  The American breakfast sauce game is lacking and the bacon is very weird
[40:30.540 --> 40:35.800]  and the sausage is in a giant patty. It's all... everything about it is slightly off.
[40:35.860 --> 40:39.200]  Well, first off, we have both kinds of patties here or both kinds of sausage.
[40:39.380 --> 40:41.940]  We have links and patties and we have scrambled sausage.
[40:42.040 --> 40:44.620]  So we have... we actually have more sausage variety here.
[40:44.700 --> 40:45.320]  I think that's ridiculous.
[40:45.320 --> 40:51.060]  And to compare crispy American bacon to any other bacon on earth is an insult.
[40:51.460 --> 40:52.740]  There is no comparison.
[40:53.500 --> 40:54.660]  I agree. There's no comparison.
[40:55.320 --> 40:56.360]  Is good just familiar?
[40:56.980 --> 40:57.940]  Good familiar.
[40:58.260 --> 41:01.440]  Does Gavin think it's good because it's just what he grew up on?
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.900]  No, it tastes delicious.
[41:04.280 --> 41:04.960]  Yeah, yes.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.800]  But do you think that because it's familiar?
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.900]  Well, I've had like a lot of food that I didn't have before.
[41:12.900 --> 41:15.460]  My 20s, I think, is also good and it's not familiar.
[41:16.220 --> 41:17.720]  That is a good point.
[41:18.460 --> 41:21.720]  Listen, I think a full English breakfast is delicious.
[41:21.960 --> 41:23.580]  I'm into the... I'm into the tomato.
[41:23.860 --> 41:25.040]  I'm into the beans, the whole thing.
[41:25.120 --> 41:29.120]  But if you compare that to what I would consider to be the quintessential American breakfast,
[41:29.200 --> 41:31.000]  which is two eggs, however you like them.
[41:31.080 --> 41:32.460]  I'll take mine over medium. Thank you.
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.260]  Toast with butter and jam, hash browns and bacon.
[41:37.460 --> 41:39.040]  I just don't see how it compares.
[41:39.700 --> 41:40.680]  Yeah, it's lacking.
[41:41.380 --> 41:43.960]  When was the last time you found a favorite food?
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.520]  It's a bulletproof meal. There's no weakness there.
[41:48.120 --> 41:49.800]  Nick, be American.
[41:50.380 --> 41:52.160]  Yeah, no, I want to hear what Nick has to say.
[41:52.320 --> 41:54.380]  I want to hear from Nick.
[41:54.920 --> 41:57.440]  I don't know. Gavin really got me with the sauce game.
[41:58.700 --> 41:59.900]  It's something to think about.
[42:00.540 --> 42:01.500]  It's something to think about.
[42:01.560 --> 42:05.940]  Also, there is more stuff on than full English breakfast.
[42:05.980 --> 42:07.680]  There's more stuff. There's more range.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.100]  More range.
[42:09.720 --> 42:13.800]  Dynamic flavors, different textures and wetnesses.
[42:14.220 --> 42:15.880]  You're advocating wetnesses?
[42:16.300 --> 42:18.740]  Yeah, like what's the point?
[42:19.360 --> 42:21.340]  You love a bit of wetness?
[42:21.960 --> 42:23.080]  Yeah, I mean, beans are wet.
[42:23.240 --> 42:26.000]  I don't want the beans to wet other stuff.
[42:26.120 --> 42:30.260]  That's why I use, as many people do, I use the sausage strategically.
[42:30.960 --> 42:34.820]  It's a little barrier between the bread and the beans.
[42:34.940 --> 42:38.480]  I've never heard such a setup for a product that didn't exist.
[42:38.480 --> 42:40.240]  That's why I use.
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.420]  And then it was just I line up my sausages.
[42:42.820 --> 42:44.740]  Sausages exist. You should go there.
[42:45.660 --> 42:46.140]  Sausage?
[42:49.200 --> 42:50.600]  What is this episode?
[42:51.720 --> 42:52.380]  It's good.
[42:52.500 --> 42:56.020]  It's a lot of arguing, but like, I don't know what about what.
[42:56.200 --> 42:59.100]  I think we're just airing out our dirty pillows.
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.160]  I also think if I'm airing out our dirty pillows.
[43:03.460 --> 43:04.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:04.500 --> 43:06.500]  Our crazy big dirty pillows.
[43:06.500 --> 43:11.180]  Uh, I think, uh, I think like a Mexican breakfast is better.
[43:11.280 --> 43:12.360]  And like, that's what I would prefer.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.920]  Oh, I totally agree, dude.
[43:13.920 --> 43:15.780]  You give me some chilaquiles or...
[43:15.780 --> 43:16.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:16.160 --> 43:16.820]  Oh, come on.
[43:17.140 --> 43:19.700]  Chilaquiles, huevos rancheros.
[43:20.060 --> 43:21.660]  Is migas a breakfast food?
[43:22.240 --> 43:22.480]  Yes.
[43:22.660 --> 43:26.180]  Yeah, I've never had migas until I moved here.
[43:26.660 --> 43:28.780]  And, uh, it's not a thing.
[43:28.960 --> 43:30.360]  It's not a thing that I ever had.
[43:30.620 --> 43:33.040]  Uh, huevos rancheros and stuff is like what I always had.
[43:33.420 --> 43:35.920]  Migas is so superior to like, man, it's incredible.
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.840]  Is that tex-mex or mex?
[43:38.260 --> 43:40.060]  I think it's definitely more tex-mex.
[43:41.100 --> 43:43.680]  The chilaquiles you get at Taco Rito.
[43:43.900 --> 43:44.800]  There are two locations.
[43:44.980 --> 43:45.560]  There's one on Burnet.
[43:45.620 --> 43:47.280]  I believe there's one on Riverside drive-thru.
[43:47.580 --> 43:49.420]  Go get the chilaquiles at Taco Rito.
[43:49.540 --> 43:52.920]  It is the best thing you will ever put in your mouth breakfast related.
[43:53.080 --> 43:54.800]  They are so fucking good.
[43:55.160 --> 43:59.760]  It's, I'm a migas fan, but these particular chilaquiles are better than any migas I've ever had.
[44:00.080 --> 44:01.760]  Yeah, I just, I just think that's like...
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.820]  That's your NF, that's your NFT right there.
[44:04.660 --> 44:07.660]  That's, uh, to me, that that's like the breakfast
[44:08.160 --> 44:10.820]  that I would pick over all like this other stuff we're laying down.
[44:11.100 --> 44:14.620]  Well, yeah, I mean, we live in the land of superior breakfast tacos.
[44:14.860 --> 44:16.020]  Obviously, we're going to go for that.
[44:16.140 --> 44:18.360]  Or kolaches even, I'd pick over anything else.
[44:18.380 --> 44:21.900]  But if we're just going to compare what I would consider to be an American breakfast
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.100]  to a British breakfast.
[44:23.860 --> 44:24.820]  That's the nice thing about America.
[44:24.880 --> 44:25.740]  We got a lot of options too.
[44:25.800 --> 44:27.480]  We didn't even get into waffles or pancakes.
[44:27.680 --> 44:28.700]  Oh, that's a great point.
[44:29.580 --> 44:30.740]  Oh, look at that.
[44:31.220 --> 44:36.000]  I feel like you've posted this exact photo like 10 times throughout the history of this podcast.
[44:36.820 --> 44:38.040]  Dude, doesn't this look great?
[44:38.220 --> 44:39.320]  Check out these mushrooms.
[44:39.520 --> 44:40.480]  They're kind of by these beans.
[44:40.680 --> 44:43.020]  And then we got like three hockey pucks if you want to take a bite.
[44:43.280 --> 44:45.640]  And I got to say, it looks pretty dry, this plate, Gavin.
[44:45.700 --> 44:46.480]  Not a lot of liquids.
[44:46.840 --> 44:48.140]  I've heard a lot about sauces.
[44:48.760 --> 44:51.480]  The sauce hasn't been put on because everyone's got a different preference.
[44:52.800 --> 44:54.240]  So the sauce doesn't come on the plate.
[44:54.940 --> 44:57.720]  Yeah, I just mean those beans don't look all that juicy.
[44:58.220 --> 44:58.740]  Well, they are.
[44:59.380 --> 44:59.740]  OK.
[45:00.620 --> 45:04.940]  Gavin holds on to this one photo and shows it like dudes that I was in the army with
[45:04.940 --> 45:05.700]  in basic training.
[45:05.920 --> 45:09.880]  They would have a photo of their girlfriend, which would clearly be a cutout headshot
[45:09.880 --> 45:11.840]  from the yearbook that they would just have.
[45:11.960 --> 45:13.120]  But this is my girlfriend.
[45:13.260 --> 45:13.940]  They would show it to you all the time.
[45:14.020 --> 45:15.000]  Like, she's really hot, isn't she?
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.340]  And you'd be like, yeah, she seems she seems lovely.
[45:17.600 --> 45:18.880]  That's Gavin and this photo.
[45:19.020 --> 45:19.180]  Yep.
[45:19.540 --> 45:19.700]  Yep.
[45:20.160 --> 45:21.600]  They look a little bit too good to be true.
[45:22.840 --> 45:24.880]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.
[45:25.100 --> 45:27.820]  You know that moment when you just need to hit pause and refresh?
[45:27.820 --> 45:30.340]  An ice cold Diet Coke isn't just a break.
[45:30.580 --> 45:33.820]  It's your chance to catch your breath and savor a moment that's all about you.
[45:34.200 --> 45:35.040]  Always refreshing.
[45:35.380 --> 45:36.560]  Still the same great taste.
[45:37.020 --> 45:37.500]  Diet Coke.
[45:37.800 --> 45:38.880]  Make time for you time.
[45:41.200 --> 45:43.420]  Introducing the new Volvo XC90.
[45:43.900 --> 45:49.320]  With seven seat versatility, Google built in and advanced safety features for all your
[45:49.320 --> 45:50.020]  precious cargo.
[45:50.320 --> 45:51.980]  The new Volvo XC90.
[45:52.260 --> 45:53.260]  Designed for life.
[45:53.480 --> 45:55.800]  Visit volvocars.com.us to learn more.
[45:55.940 --> 45:57.360]  Can I present to you an idea I've been working on?
[45:57.360 --> 45:58.080]  Yes.
[45:58.460 --> 45:58.900]  Please.
[45:59.180 --> 46:00.540]  It's, it's, oh, shit.
[46:01.680 --> 46:04.820]  I went to paste it and it pasted a picture of a breakfast.
[46:06.780 --> 46:08.900]  You are really hanging on to that breakfast, man.
[46:09.600 --> 46:10.160]  All right.
[46:10.180 --> 46:14.280]  It's, uh, it's kind of gameplay related, but I thought we could potentially start a new
[46:14.280 --> 46:17.440]  series called The Wheel of F**k.
[46:18.240 --> 46:19.760]  The Wheel of F**k.
[46:19.940 --> 46:20.860]  Take a look at this.
[46:21.340 --> 46:22.780]  Uh, Vin Master and Dirt.
[46:22.900 --> 46:24.240]  Okay, so we got a bunch of achievements.
[46:24.880 --> 46:29.900]  So it's just a bunch of very, in my opinion, difficult video game feats.
[46:30.360 --> 46:33.280]  And my, my, uh, idea was that we have to get together.
[46:33.460 --> 46:36.300]  We spin the wheel and then we just have to do one of these.
[46:37.420 --> 46:39.660]  What, and, and these are from like different games.
[46:39.680 --> 46:41.160]  Like, what, like, what are these?
[46:41.900 --> 46:44.100]  Are these like different games or what are these?
[46:44.160 --> 46:44.820]  I don't know what these are.
[46:45.120 --> 46:46.600]  There's Halo, you got Dead Rising.
[46:46.900 --> 46:47.440]  It's Dead Rising.
[46:47.900 --> 46:48.880]  Flawless Raider is Destiny.
[46:48.980 --> 46:50.420]  No point in dying is Limbo.
[46:50.760 --> 46:52.160]  Go to second wheel is amazing.
[46:52.660 --> 46:53.960]  Uh, Mile High Club is Call of Duty.
[46:53.960 --> 46:57.280]  Ultimate Defender is one of the ones we already tried in Grawr.
[46:57.480 --> 46:59.940]  And Vin Master Endure is in Halo 3 ODST.
[47:00.460 --> 47:04.060]  Uh, I've got a few of these, but they, they all, uh, they take some,
[47:04.420 --> 47:06.620]  a lot of them take some real good co-op time.
[47:07.760 --> 47:10.040]  Is 7 Day Survivor co-op?
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.060]  No, and neither is the Limbo one.
[47:12.180 --> 47:13.100]  It's just, we would have to...
[47:13.100 --> 47:13.760]  Or Mile High Club.
[47:14.060 --> 47:14.940]  Or Mile High Club, yeah.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.200]  Mile High Club we could potentially all just try at the same time.
[47:18.120 --> 47:19.460]  I think I've done five of these.
[47:19.860 --> 47:21.480]  Until one of us gets it.
[47:21.620 --> 47:21.860]  Yeah.
[47:22.860 --> 47:25.240]  I've done a few of these already myself.
[47:25.660 --> 47:29.680]  I guided you guys through Flawless Raider, but they patched how I would do that.
[47:29.800 --> 47:30.260]  So I don't know.
[47:30.580 --> 47:32.520]  I don't think that's ever happening again.
[47:32.820 --> 47:36.160]  So are you saying that, I mean, I have this wheel up right now.
[47:36.180 --> 47:38.180]  Are you saying that we spin this wheel and see what happens?
[47:39.840 --> 47:45.400]  I mean, what, like actually start the series now and then film the, film the main bit another time?
[47:46.220 --> 47:46.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:46.960 --> 47:50.900]  I mean, like, let's start the series on this episode to say, hey, we're going to do this
[47:50.900 --> 47:53.500]  thing. Who knows when the fuck it's going to come out, but we're going to do it.
[47:55.200 --> 47:57.900]  Now, if it lands on a single player one,
[47:58.060 --> 48:01.220]  do we spin another wheel of all of our names to see who has to do it?
[48:01.540 --> 48:02.680]  I like that idea.
[48:02.860 --> 48:03.260]  Yes.
[48:04.320 --> 48:09.040]  The way I saw it happening was that depending on how many people are in that game,
[48:09.700 --> 48:13.920]  we would then spin the wheel that many times to get the, get the cast.
[48:14.120 --> 48:14.880]  Cast. Okay.
[48:15.080 --> 48:16.220]  I love this idea.
[48:16.560 --> 48:18.420]  So let's spin this first wheel.
[48:18.580 --> 48:19.680]  Okay. You ready, Gavin?
[48:19.680 --> 48:22.900]  Are you ready for me to spin this wheel? Everyone's watching the screen. We're all good.
[48:23.000 --> 48:23.520]  I'm watching.
[48:23.840 --> 48:24.520]  Yeah. Okay.
[48:24.620 --> 48:29.760]  All right, guys, here we go. We're going to spin the wheel to see what we're going to do.
[48:31.580 --> 48:35.480]  None of that wheel is fun except for go to second wheel.
[48:46.020 --> 48:47.700]  We have a winner boys.
[48:48.220 --> 48:48.680]  Holy shit.
[48:48.680 --> 48:50.840]  Looks like we'll be making a second wheel.
[48:51.300 --> 48:51.740]  Okay.
[48:53.480 --> 48:55.080]  You just said that there was good stuff on the second wheel.
[48:55.080 --> 48:58.140]  This is the lamest thing that could have happened.
[48:58.620 --> 48:59.000]  Boo.
[48:59.440 --> 49:00.720]  I hate this now.
[49:01.100 --> 49:01.220]  Boo.
[49:02.560 --> 49:03.880]  That's how you ruin a wheel.
[49:04.100 --> 49:04.220]  God.
[49:06.260 --> 49:10.760]  Ruin a series. I don't think I could have been more excited about whatever was coming next.
[49:11.220 --> 49:13.260]  What do you mean I said there was good stuff on the second wheel?
[49:13.840 --> 49:14.920]  You said good stuff on the second wheel.
[49:14.940 --> 49:15.540]  He did.
[49:15.700 --> 49:16.520]  He did.
[49:16.740 --> 49:17.900]  You said that.
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.940]  You really hyped up the second wheel.
[49:20.420 --> 49:22.100]  I said there's good stuff on the second wheel.
[49:22.200 --> 49:22.500]  Yeah.
[49:24.100 --> 49:26.060]  Are you kidding me?
[49:26.460 --> 49:27.560]  That was three minutes ago.
[49:27.940 --> 49:30.620]  I said that I said the second wheel is amazing.
[49:31.540 --> 49:32.060]  Yeah.
[49:32.260 --> 49:32.740]  Yeah.
[49:34.780 --> 49:37.780]  The second wheel is just our concept of the second wheel.
[49:37.980 --> 49:38.760]  We got to make it now.
[49:39.120 --> 49:39.840]  This is ridiculous.
[49:40.680 --> 49:41.200]  You're...
[49:42.440 --> 49:42.960]  I...
[49:42.960 --> 49:43.340]  Damn.
[49:43.700 --> 49:44.040]  What?
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.440]  Whenever we have like go to third wheel,
[49:46.440 --> 49:49.800]  we don't start putting stuff on it until we get there, surely, don't we?
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.800]  It felt like you presented it like you had a really good second wheel.
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.860]  I think if you're presenting a series that is wheel based, you have all the wheels.
[49:57.280 --> 49:57.400]  Yeah.
[49:57.520 --> 50:01.060]  It just felt like you really had a second wheel locked in, man.
[50:01.380 --> 50:01.840]  Well, I'll be honest.
[50:01.920 --> 50:04.200]  It took me about 20 minutes to come up with the first wheel.
[50:04.360 --> 50:07.000]  So I assume we wouldn't land on the second.
[50:08.280 --> 50:11.300]  Should we just build the second wheel together right now?
[50:11.440 --> 50:12.260]  We can do that.
[50:12.640 --> 50:13.480]  Is that what we're doing?
[50:13.600 --> 50:14.420]  I'm fine with that.
[50:14.420 --> 50:17.620]  Because what Gavin did is he said, you know what, guys, I've got a great idea.
[50:17.700 --> 50:19.100]  Let's all go on a road trip.
[50:19.340 --> 50:22.700]  And he showed us a car and then he went, oh, I didn't put any gas in it.
[50:22.960 --> 50:24.160]  No gas in this car.
[50:24.160 --> 50:27.000]  It's the equivalent of me saying, let's go on a road trip.
[50:27.140 --> 50:30.020]  Road trips are great, but I don't actually have a trip in mind.
[50:30.860 --> 50:31.840]  And I don't have a car either.
[50:32.760 --> 50:35.860]  So first off, we got to have go back to first wheel, probably.
[50:36.160 --> 50:38.540]  Why don't we just have four go back to first wheels?
[50:38.860 --> 50:40.080]  No, no, we don't have to do that.
[50:40.260 --> 50:40.660]  Let's not. Hold on.
[50:40.780 --> 50:43.840]  I mean, you could have done that if you had made a second wheel.
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.220]  I think we have one that's a play Sloppy Joe's bingo instead.
[50:49.980 --> 50:54.640]  OK, maybe one that's make Gavin do everything on the first wheel by himself.
[50:55.420 --> 50:57.820]  I don't think it's possible, but I'd give it a go.
[50:58.080 --> 51:00.020]  Also half a car, put half a car on there.
[51:00.080 --> 51:01.460]  OK, half a half a car.
[51:01.660 --> 51:03.220]  OK, do you want me to have call Barbara?
[51:04.480 --> 51:05.420]  Call small wife.
[51:05.680 --> 51:08.840]  OK, OK, she's not.
[51:08.940 --> 51:10.940]  We're going to have going to list these things out for her.
[51:11.140 --> 51:12.820]  She's not going to know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[51:13.680 --> 51:15.000]  Oh, Eric, go to third wheel.
[51:15.300 --> 51:15.980]  Oh, that's right.
[51:16.060 --> 51:16.780]  Go to third wheel.
[51:17.060 --> 51:17.340]  OK.
[51:18.660 --> 51:21.760]  I want Gavin has to beat Donkey Kong 64.
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.140]  Oh, yeah, 64.
[51:24.620 --> 51:25.500]  Donkey Kong 64.
[51:26.400 --> 51:29.500]  But I can't show you can't film all of that, can I?
[51:29.660 --> 51:30.060]  Wow.
[51:30.840 --> 51:32.120]  It's not going to land on it.
[51:32.120 --> 51:33.700]  So it's hard to stream it, right?
[51:34.200 --> 51:35.160]  Yeah, you can stream it.
[51:35.600 --> 51:38.200]  What else would be on the second wheel dealer?
[51:38.380 --> 51:39.860]  It could be dealer's choice.
[51:41.280 --> 51:42.420]  Oh, dealer's choice.
[51:43.900 --> 51:44.540]  Who's the dealer?
[51:44.760 --> 51:46.400]  We'll have to spin for who dealer is.
[51:46.640 --> 51:46.980]  Spin the dealer.
[51:47.120 --> 51:47.300]  Yeah.
[51:49.340 --> 51:51.000]  Do we think that's enough stuff?
[51:51.060 --> 51:51.940]  I feel like that's quite a bit.
[51:52.160 --> 51:52.680]  That's quite a bit.
[51:53.520 --> 51:54.300]  You want me to shuffle it?
[51:54.660 --> 51:55.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:55.780 --> 51:57.260]  How many times you want me to shuffle it?
[51:59.100 --> 51:59.540]  Off.
[52:00.020 --> 52:01.340]  Two, two for the second wheel.
[52:01.540 --> 52:02.440]  One, two.
[52:02.600 --> 52:04.280]  OK, I think only two things moved.
[52:05.120 --> 52:09.540]  All right, guys, are you ready for the second wheel?
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.280]  Let's spin it.
[52:11.400 --> 52:13.880]  OK, and here we go.
[52:18.970 --> 52:20.690]  Go back to first wheel.
[52:20.690 --> 52:21.970]  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[52:23.290 --> 52:23.570]  Perfect.
[52:23.850 --> 52:25.190]  Oh, go back to first wheel.
[52:25.330 --> 52:26.510]  OK, let's go back to first.
[52:26.750 --> 52:28.790]  All right, we're back to the first wheel.
[52:29.670 --> 52:31.270]  All right, are you guys ready?
[52:31.270 --> 52:31.850]  Now the show's back on.
[52:31.930 --> 52:32.850]  Now I'm excited again.
[52:32.950 --> 52:34.350]  All right, and here we go.
[52:34.510 --> 52:35.110]  Spinning the wheel.
[52:37.650 --> 52:38.450]  Oh, God.
[52:40.510 --> 52:40.910]  No!
[52:42.450 --> 52:45.150]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to second wheel.
[52:45.430 --> 52:45.830]  No!
[52:46.050 --> 52:46.790]  What's wrong with this?
[52:47.310 --> 52:47.950]  All right.
[52:48.330 --> 52:50.190]  What did you do to your wheel, Gavin?
[52:50.310 --> 52:52.570]  How many times do you want me to shuffle this?
[52:52.830 --> 52:54.110]  What's wrong with this wheel?
[52:54.650 --> 52:55.890]  How many times do you want me to shuffle it?
[52:55.970 --> 52:56.550]  Let's do two more times.
[52:56.730 --> 52:57.870]  One, two.
[52:58.030 --> 52:58.630]  A lot of good ones.
[52:58.670 --> 52:59.170]  Here we go.
[52:59.230 --> 53:00.870]  And here's the spin of the second wheel.
[53:02.510 --> 53:03.310]  Oh, God.
[53:03.470 --> 53:04.990]  Gavin, why did you do it?
[53:08.710 --> 53:10.730]  Make Gavin do first.
[53:10.730 --> 53:12.950]  Make Gavin do first wheel activities.
[53:13.470 --> 53:20.890]  So now we go back to the first wheel to see what thing Gavin is going to do.
[53:21.030 --> 53:23.310]  Gavin, you'll be doing one of these activities.
[53:23.570 --> 53:24.410]  Are you ready?
[53:24.950 --> 53:25.850]  I'm so ready.
[53:26.170 --> 53:27.510]  Here we go!
[53:28.810 --> 53:29.950]  Gavin, you might have to recruit.
[53:29.950 --> 53:30.650]  I'll have to recruit.
[53:30.850 --> 53:32.930]  Yeah, we're going to have to spin, but it's the first one.
[53:33.150 --> 53:33.250]  Wait, no.
[53:33.850 --> 53:34.370]  No.
[53:35.530 --> 53:39.830]  Gavin is doing no point in dying.
[53:39.830 --> 53:44.290]  And if you guys can explain what no point in dying is, go for it.
[53:44.470 --> 53:46.710]  I believe it's beat limbo, right?
[53:46.790 --> 53:47.350]  Without dying.
[53:48.170 --> 53:50.770]  The entirety of limbo with less than five deaths.
[53:51.210 --> 53:53.110]  Okay, sounds good.
[53:53.150 --> 53:54.590]  I'm excited to watch this.
[53:54.890 --> 53:55.910]  Have you ever done that, Gavin?
[53:57.430 --> 53:58.750]  Have you ever tried?
[53:59.030 --> 54:01.170]  I think it's the only achievement I'm missing in that game.
[54:01.670 --> 54:02.370]  Oh, that's great.
[54:02.610 --> 54:03.510]  That's awesome, man.
[54:04.490 --> 54:05.170]  Not for long.
[54:05.630 --> 54:06.930]  Not for long.
[54:07.450 --> 54:10.110]  This could be an ongoing series where we just sort of like...
[54:11.230 --> 54:12.930]  We kind of like grab time.
[54:13.330 --> 54:18.290]  Completely, in every aspect of this stupid idea, I've faced the shit out of myself.
[54:18.770 --> 54:19.430]  You idiot!
[54:21.610 --> 54:22.050]  Moron!
[54:24.070 --> 54:27.530]  Yeah, well, I feel like you just tipped the hand of the question I was going to ask,
[54:27.630 --> 54:32.130]  but now that we're post-first episode of the game, how do you feel about your new idea?
[54:33.090 --> 54:33.830]  I suck!
[54:35.610 --> 54:38.970]  Oh, you better get good, because you gotta not die.
[54:39.210 --> 54:40.630]  So what do we need to do?
[54:40.690 --> 54:42.650]  Well, just like next time we're going to be playing a game,
[54:42.650 --> 54:44.610]  instead of us playing a game, it'll be Gavin.
[54:45.830 --> 54:48.190]  It'll be Gavin playing... you say limbo?
[54:48.910 --> 54:49.290]  Limbo!
[54:49.490 --> 54:52.290]  It's gonna be like an eight hour arcade game.
[54:53.290 --> 54:55.470]  Oh, it's the little black and white.
[54:55.590 --> 54:57.670]  It's like the shadow scary boy game.
[54:57.770 --> 54:57.910]  Yeah.
[54:58.530 --> 55:00.990]  Yeah, you're fucked, buddy.
[55:01.510 --> 55:03.630]  Yeah, and the little freaking worm goes in your head.
[55:03.630 --> 55:05.110]  Or is it a worm or like something else?
[55:05.530 --> 55:06.510]  I don't know. I guess we're gonna find out.
[55:06.790 --> 55:08.270]  I never played that game. It looked too hard.
[55:08.930 --> 55:09.990]  It is hard.
[55:10.330 --> 55:13.910]  And there's a bunch of traps that are just like total FU traps that you have to know about.
[55:14.150 --> 55:14.330]  Yeah.
[55:14.750 --> 55:15.630]  Do you know about them?
[55:15.770 --> 55:16.310]  It's definitely gonna take a little bit.
[55:16.410 --> 55:16.610]  Yeah.
[55:17.790 --> 55:19.430]  Sweet! Gonna be a good series.
[55:19.930 --> 55:23.010]  Gotta put bear traps down to like hit spider legs.
[55:23.470 --> 55:25.770]  Isn't it only like a three hour game?
[55:25.770 --> 55:26.830]  It is very short.
[55:27.770 --> 55:28.850]  Oh, we could do it in one sitting.
[55:28.990 --> 55:29.910]  Yeah, just one stream.
[55:30.070 --> 55:31.770]  That is kind of the way you do it.
[55:31.770 --> 55:31.990]  You can do it on Friday. We'll watch.
[55:32.450 --> 55:32.670]  Yeah.
[55:34.290 --> 55:35.930]  So is that what we're doing on Friday?
[55:35.990 --> 55:36.650]  We're going to do that?
[55:36.930 --> 55:38.090]  This is such a backfire.
[55:38.450 --> 55:39.290]  Friday that this comes out.
[55:39.490 --> 55:41.110]  We got like eight things to make on Friday.
[55:44.030 --> 55:44.890]  I'm just trying.
[55:45.010 --> 55:47.210]  I'm trying to make room for your idea, Gavin.
[55:47.310 --> 55:47.910]  I'm sorry.
[55:48.090 --> 55:48.710]  Sorry, man.
[55:48.950 --> 55:50.850]  I have to do all of my ideas.
[55:51.190 --> 55:54.170]  I really apologize that I was trying to make room for your idea, dude.
[55:54.830 --> 55:55.590]  Let's start with this one.
[55:55.630 --> 55:59.850]  I'm so glad that it wasn't Flawless Raider because we're just not getting that.
[56:00.330 --> 56:03.350]  Yeah, don't punish us for supporting you and your creativity.
[56:03.350 --> 56:06.230]  Because they changed how we did it before.
[56:06.770 --> 56:08.190]  You can't do it that way anymore.
[56:08.910 --> 56:09.290]  Oh, really?
[56:09.750 --> 56:10.070]  Yeah.
[56:10.370 --> 56:12.890]  Like they updated that raid.
[56:13.250 --> 56:14.830]  They took away a lot of those cheats.
[56:15.710 --> 56:16.690]  Oh, shit.
[56:17.250 --> 56:20.510]  So we just would have never completed that.
[56:20.990 --> 56:22.370]  Well, it's surely still doable.
[56:23.070 --> 56:24.090]  Not by us, though.
[56:24.130 --> 56:25.230]  Not by us.
[56:26.590 --> 56:28.870]  A whole raid without dying?
[56:29.450 --> 56:29.590]  No.
[56:30.150 --> 56:30.630]  Huh.
[56:31.250 --> 56:33.730]  Gavin, have you seen us?
[56:34.830 --> 56:35.310]  Yeah.
[56:35.930 --> 56:36.930]  Oh, OK, then.
[56:37.390 --> 56:41.870]  We'd have to set a new standard of it of like not a continuous run,
[56:41.910 --> 56:46.630]  like complete each section individually at some point in which we didn't die.
[56:47.190 --> 56:47.390]  Yeah.
[56:47.830 --> 56:51.630]  I mean, fuck, one of us can't even beat Limbo without dying five times.
[56:51.690 --> 56:54.470]  Now all four of us are going to beat a raid without dying once.
[56:55.210 --> 56:57.850]  I think as far as what you could have landed on,
[56:57.850 --> 57:00.030]  that was probably the easiest of them, Gavin.
[57:00.470 --> 57:02.770]  Yeah, but I was just bummed that it was only me.
[57:03.150 --> 57:04.050]  Well, yeah, that that was this.
[57:04.150 --> 57:05.290]  You should have built out the second wheel.
[57:05.970 --> 57:06.910]  Yeah, I think it's...
[57:07.810 --> 57:08.130]  Yeah.
[57:08.570 --> 57:10.050]  We'll all be there, so it'll be all right.
[57:10.410 --> 57:12.830]  Once again, though, a lot of these are only single player.
[57:13.590 --> 57:14.670]  Mile High Club, single player.
[57:14.770 --> 57:15.690]  That would have been just you.
[57:17.170 --> 57:19.050]  That one, I just envisioned all of us doing it.
[57:19.550 --> 57:20.190]  Oh, simultaneously?
[57:20.610 --> 57:20.870]  Yeah.
[57:21.450 --> 57:21.670]  OK.
[57:22.250 --> 57:23.950]  Because it's kind of like it's like arcade mode.
[57:23.970 --> 57:25.370]  It's very quick, quick resets.
[57:25.370 --> 57:29.850]  It could be a fun thing where, like, once you're done, you can just leave the recording.
[57:31.430 --> 57:34.130]  Oh my god, so like it's the first one to do it in the videos,
[57:34.210 --> 57:35.790]  and it's the last one to do it in the videos.
[57:35.930 --> 57:36.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:36.590 --> 57:39.150]  It's not done until every single one does it.
[57:39.450 --> 57:40.690]  Unless you remember that.
[57:40.970 --> 57:42.370]  That's so funny.
[57:42.910 --> 57:44.390]  Let's definitely remember that.
[57:44.950 --> 57:45.890]  I love that.
[57:47.450 --> 57:48.330]  It would be so...
[57:48.870 --> 57:51.410]  Just being the last one would be so sad.
[57:52.570 --> 57:55.110]  Speaking of that, what was the idea we were talking about the other night, Eric,
[57:55.110 --> 57:58.990]  that we were going to remember where everybody puts in $100, but only one person loses?
[57:59.490 --> 58:03.150]  So we had an idea for if we were doing like Mario Party again,
[58:03.210 --> 58:05.370]  it would have to be a five-player game, whatever it is,
[58:05.510 --> 58:08.230]  and just doing it over time this way.
[58:08.710 --> 58:16.810]  We would all pick a valuable item of some kind that we each personally like.
[58:17.070 --> 58:18.970]  We would put them all in one place.
[58:19.290 --> 58:24.510]  And then this five-player game, if you finish first through fourth,
[58:24.510 --> 58:25.750]  you get your item back.
[58:25.850 --> 58:28.830]  But if you finish dead last, your item is destroyed in front of you.
[58:29.570 --> 58:30.010]  Yeah.
[58:36.530 --> 58:37.670]  I hate it.
[58:37.930 --> 58:40.530]  That also could be a fun thing with the wheel,
[58:41.110 --> 58:45.170]  where you don't know what place is losing their item until after we spin a wheel.
[58:45.690 --> 58:45.810]  Oh, wow!
[58:47.050 --> 58:48.950]  Imagine it's first and it's like, oh my god.
[58:49.350 --> 58:49.970]  Yeah, oh my god.
[58:50.210 --> 58:51.490]  Everybody's fighting not to win.
[58:52.790 --> 58:54.250]  That's a really interesting mechanic.
[58:54.890 --> 58:58.410]  Hey, speaking of interesting and Friday being a busy day,
[58:58.830 --> 59:01.310]  we need to talk about this briefly, if you don't mind.
[59:01.430 --> 59:03.670]  We're going to record birth year movie ranker on Friday.
[59:03.810 --> 59:04.470]  I'm good there.
[59:05.050 --> 59:07.990]  But we're recording the moon ranker supplemental on Friday.
[59:08.350 --> 59:11.470]  And if I could just get a refresh on what constitutes,
[59:11.830 --> 59:13.350]  like what a moon ranker is.
[59:13.490 --> 59:15.570]  There's aspects of the moon, you know, moon stuff.
[59:15.910 --> 59:16.710]  But it's not a draft.
[59:17.590 --> 59:22.070]  I mean, we're drafting these moon things and then we rank them.
[59:22.510 --> 59:23.710]  Is it like moon, not moon?
[59:23.710 --> 59:24.030]  OK.
[59:24.630 --> 59:25.890]  No, I mean, well, I don't know.
[59:25.930 --> 59:26.710]  What do you what do you think?
[59:26.870 --> 59:29.530]  Like rank the like rank moon stuff?
[59:29.950 --> 59:34.190]  Yeah, I'm kind of excited for it to not be clarified and see what everybody brings.
[59:34.370 --> 59:35.270]  It's the moon, dude.
[59:35.650 --> 59:36.750]  OK, yeah.
[59:37.010 --> 59:37.910]  But I don't think you can.
[59:37.910 --> 59:38.850]  I don't think you can grab.
[59:39.010 --> 59:44.130]  I don't think the moon itself, like the actual moon, you can't draft.
[59:44.330 --> 59:45.090]  So it's moon, not moon?
[59:45.830 --> 59:47.270]  No, no, because you can get other moons.
[59:47.350 --> 59:53.690]  It's just that our moon would have to be off limits, like our actual moon is off limits.
[59:53.690 --> 59:56.690]  But indoor would be fine.
[59:56.950 --> 59:58.610]  Yeah, I don't have a problem with that.
[59:58.830 --> 59:58.870]  OK.
[59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.490]  You know, you're ranking that.
[01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:04.510]  I just think that like in terms of a moon ranker, moon would have to be number one.
[01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.790]  So we have to eliminate it from the pool.
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.470]  Like it's the thing that we are doing it around.
[01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.630]  So you cannot pick it.
[01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.350]  Right.
[01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:12.250]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:12.730]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:14.210]  So that's it.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:14.890]  That's moon ranker.
[01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:19.510]  Also, I definitely think that it's moon ranker sounds like moon raker.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.670]  And that's why we're doing this because it's a lot of fun.
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.110]  Jimmy Bond and moon ranker.
[01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.890]  Yeah.
[01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:26.510]  So there you go.
[01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:27.530]  OK, cool.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.630]  Thank you for the elucidation.
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.190]  That helps me out a lot.
[01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.610]  Sure, man.
[01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:33.010]  Shall we wrap this episode up?
[01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.910]  Yeah, because we got more stuff to do.
[01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:37.350]  We got another episode we got to record.
[01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.730]  Yeah, I got to watch some guides on Limbo, apparently.
[01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.190]  Who here has the achievement?
[01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:48.550]  I tried for it and I just I didn't follow through.
[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:50.490]  Andrew's the best gamer we know.
[01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.290]  I looked at it.
[01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.150]  Interesting.
[01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:56.370]  So if anyone wants to play alongside me and, you know, work on this as a little...
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:00.530]  Well, I don't want to go against the wheel, so I'm going to respect the wheel.
[01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:05.470]  Yeah, I think if anyone in the audience wants to go alongside Gavin and, you know, do this also,
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:06.390]  I say go for it.
[01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.250]  If it didn't land on Gavin does it by himself on the second wheel,
[01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.170]  then I would gladly do this with you.
[01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.410]  It would be disrespectful to the wheel.
[01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:15.370]  It would be.
[01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.890]  Gotta honor the wheel.
[01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:22.110]  Imagine if the series couldn't progress unless I beat Destiny Raid solo.
[01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:30.530]  Well, there you have it.
[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:32.330]  Thanks for listening to this episode.
[01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:34.390]  Check out the Patreon.
[01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:40.010]  Check out Mario Party March, which is coming to a close as the release of this episode.
[01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:43.910]  We're getting near the end on incredible, incredible stuff.
[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.490]  By the time you hear the next episode, it will be over.
[01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:51.570]  However, we will have not done it because we have to double record this episode this week.
[01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.130]  So, who will win Mario Party March?
[01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:55.570]  It's a mystery even to us.
[01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.830]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod.
[01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:59.290]  You can check it out over there.
[01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.470]  Bye.
[01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:00.970]  I was going to say something.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.750]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:05.790]  I was going to say you'll know before we do, but then I didn't...
[01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:06.290]  It didn't really...
[01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:09.450]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.770]  I don't think it's...
[01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.290]  So then I just pivoted to bye.
[01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:13.130]  But then that...
[01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:15.030]  That seemed to throw everybody.
[01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.070]  But a bye, that is how you close out.
[01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:17.610]  Bye.
[01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.810]  We'll see you next time.
[01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:20.950]  Bye.
