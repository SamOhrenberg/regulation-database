[00:30.440 --> 00:36.040]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey,
[00:36.200 --> 00:40.620]  and with me as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[00:41.160 --> 00:44.620]  This is episode 17. Hello, gents.
[00:45.080 --> 00:45.300]  Hello.
[00:45.460 --> 00:51.840]  I need to use my nickname, Jeff, my actual, my proper title now as Mr. Worldwide,
[00:52.580 --> 00:59.220]  as one of the winners of the Olympic prediction video, clearly have a pulse
[00:59.220 --> 01:00.920]  on the global community.
[01:01.120 --> 01:02.260]  You're getting right into it, huh?
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.360]  I am, yeah. We're going right in.
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.380]  Well, should we talk about that? If the audience is unaware,
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.180]  recently we put out a piece of supplemental content, I highly recommend you check it out
[01:11.180 --> 01:19.620]  if you haven't, where we guessed the over-unders on 25 countries participating in the Olympics,
[01:19.620 --> 01:24.440]  like the hot 25, if you will. And then we tracked it throughout the well,
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.500]  the audience was very capably tracked it for us throughout the entirety of the Olympics.
[01:28.740 --> 01:29.080]  They were amazing.
[01:29.320 --> 01:32.020]  And now that the Olympics is over, we can declare how everyone did.
[01:32.440 --> 01:34.720]  Sure can. I know how I did.
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.040]  Well, I know how I did.
[01:36.920 --> 01:38.240]  Wow, I didn't come last.
[01:38.800 --> 01:39.200]  Wow.
[01:39.600 --> 01:41.740]  For the first time in his life, Gavin didn't come last.
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.220]  If I'd have gone all over, would I have got better score?
[01:47.640 --> 01:49.080]  We don't need you to come all over.
[01:49.920 --> 01:51.100]  I'd like to keep it.
[01:53.580 --> 01:58.540]  So the gold medal was a tie, a two-way tie to Andrew and Jeff.
[01:58.600 --> 02:01.160]  Out of 25 countries, we correctly guessed 15.
[02:01.760 --> 02:07.020]  The bronze medal goes to Gavin with 13 correct choices by picking the under on all 25.
[02:08.040 --> 02:11.520]  And fourth place was a tie between Eric and Nick, who each had 12.
[02:12.140 --> 02:15.240]  Correctly guessed isn't exactly the word I'd describe my process.
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.620]  I'd say I understood and felt the vibes of the places.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.380]  Correctly. Yeah.
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.800]  As Eric just wrote, no guessing involved in my part.
[02:27.000 --> 02:27.980]  But Jeff, we're tied.
[02:28.520 --> 02:29.620]  We can't have a tie.
[02:30.020 --> 02:31.760]  We got to figure out something for that.
[02:32.240 --> 02:32.800]  Do we do?
[02:33.400 --> 02:34.180]  I think so.
[02:34.500 --> 02:36.060]  A 1500 meter sprint.
[02:36.980 --> 02:39.220]  No, it has to be a simulation thing.
[02:39.500 --> 02:44.020]  OK, because we didn't have any direct involvement in the results of this.
[02:44.020 --> 02:47.760]  We have to come up with something that we can spectate.
[02:48.340 --> 02:50.740]  What about a coin flip?
[02:52.580 --> 02:53.380]  I don't.
[02:53.580 --> 02:54.540]  Jeff is a coin guy.
[02:54.900 --> 02:57.220]  It seems unfair to Andrew.
[02:57.660 --> 02:58.300]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:58.380 --> 03:00.760]  It's like it's like it wouldn't make sense for us to bet on hockey.
[03:00.880 --> 03:01.540]  I would be fucked.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.420]  And you can't bet on coin.
[03:03.500 --> 03:08.140]  Didn't I go like oh and 10 when Eric was flipping coins previously in the podcast?
[03:08.300 --> 03:13.180]  At one point, I don't think I want to do coins based on past history of this show.
[03:14.380 --> 03:15.900]  The Paralympics is coming up.
[03:16.860 --> 03:19.380]  We have college football starting.
[03:19.760 --> 03:22.760]  The NFL preseason is going right now.
[03:23.560 --> 03:24.940]  WNBA is coming back.
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.280]  I think if you guys do the whole college football season,
[03:28.380 --> 03:31.000]  I think that's a great way to settle who is superior in the Olympics.
[03:31.260 --> 03:33.000]  But that's just my suggestion.
[03:33.560 --> 03:35.340]  The whole college football season.
[03:35.520 --> 03:38.240]  Well, yeah, you have to get it to fit where you want one game boring.
[03:38.400 --> 03:38.780]  You got it.
[03:38.800 --> 03:40.200]  It's got to be definitive, dude.
[03:40.220 --> 03:41.080]  Stretch that out.
[03:41.080 --> 03:41.800]  Huh?
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.560]  I yeah, I guess what we pick conference.
[03:44.700 --> 03:45.180]  I don't even know.
[03:45.480 --> 03:47.000]  I barely know how college football works.
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.400]  I feel pretty good about this then.
[03:48.860 --> 03:49.240]  I'm yeah.
[03:49.260 --> 03:50.720]  But what are what are the vibes?
[03:50.820 --> 03:52.080]  What are like the college vibes?
[03:52.240 --> 03:54.480]  You know, it doesn't matter how it works.
[03:54.540 --> 03:56.520]  You got to just sort of go with the vibes.
[03:56.940 --> 04:00.360]  The Rainbow Warriors are about to win back to back college football championships.
[04:00.600 --> 04:01.380]  That's the vibes.
[04:01.460 --> 04:05.940]  I'm only aware of what's happening in my fictitious college football world.
[04:07.640 --> 04:09.480]  The general vibes, I don't know.
[04:09.480 --> 04:12.940]  I don't even know how to track that, but I would like to.
[04:13.040 --> 04:18.620]  As an aside from this, I'd like to get into some NFL stuff this season as like a show.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.600]  I talk about doing kickers.
[04:20.800 --> 04:21.660]  I want to do.
[04:21.780 --> 04:24.800]  Have you guys ever done an eliminator pool for like a pick them eliminator?
[04:25.080 --> 04:27.080]  I think that'd be really fun with the audience.
[04:27.220 --> 04:28.640]  Well, what you.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.740]  So it's every team in the league and you have to pick one winner,
[04:32.940 --> 04:34.720]  but you can only pick that team once.
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.380]  And if they win, you continue on.
[04:37.380 --> 04:41.160]  But if the team you pick loses, you're eliminated from the pool
[04:41.160 --> 04:43.580]  and you just keep going until there's a winner.
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.680]  How so it goes two weeks?
[04:46.080 --> 04:47.360]  No, it goes the whole season.
[04:47.520 --> 04:47.720]  Potentially.
[04:48.420 --> 04:48.860]  Yes.
[04:49.860 --> 04:52.040]  But the way we play it, I was.
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.220]  Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know, man.
[04:54.280 --> 04:54.840]  That's pretty funny.
[04:55.040 --> 04:58.540]  It will be a tournament in which we spectate and watch the community.
[04:58.960 --> 05:00.140]  See who wins there.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.820]  But I think it'd be fun because you have to you have to guess like when an underdog will win
[05:05.820 --> 05:07.800]  is like the challenge of it.
[05:08.060 --> 05:10.780]  I'm all for doing any version of this.
[05:10.860 --> 05:14.200]  I had so much fun doing the Olympics over and under that.
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.480]  I would love to do it again and the summer movie thing, which is still ongoing, by the way.
[05:19.380 --> 05:22.220]  I believe, Andrew, you just leapt into place, didn't you?
[05:22.260 --> 05:23.120]  Over the weekend, Mr.
[05:23.460 --> 05:24.300]  Worldwide, Mr.
[05:24.380 --> 05:26.340]  Box office printing machine.
[05:26.540 --> 05:28.020]  I can rework the second one.
[05:28.040 --> 05:30.100]  That one we got to put in the shop.
[05:30.200 --> 05:34.320]  Andrew, you might be dethroning Howard Stern as the new king of all media.
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.100]  Look at you on top of the Internet world.
[05:39.820 --> 05:43.000]  But anyway, I've had so much fun doing both of those that I would love to do something with
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.560]  NFL or college football.
[05:44.720 --> 05:47.680]  You know, my family, we actually invited Andrew two years ago.
[05:48.360 --> 05:50.320]  My wife's family does a college pick them.
[05:50.440 --> 06:00.160]  And it has become the most intense and like a thrilling thing in my life for the four or
[06:00.160 --> 06:01.420]  five months the college football was on.
[06:01.420 --> 06:05.800]  Just competing against her dad and uncle and her and Kent and all those people.
[06:06.000 --> 06:13.000]  I got screwed in that pool by ESPN's poor wording because I know I knew nothing about
[06:13.000 --> 06:14.300]  I was having a great season.
[06:14.400 --> 06:16.500]  We talked about it and I was killing it.
[06:16.800 --> 06:17.720]  And then I didn't.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.600]  I was scared to do research and I went to put in my picks and it said, you're too early.
[06:23.740 --> 06:25.740]  And I thought, that's OK, whatever.
[06:26.060 --> 06:27.260]  I'll come back later, I guess.
[06:27.640 --> 06:28.640]  And then all the games happened.
[06:28.680 --> 06:29.100]  I forgot.
[06:29.100 --> 06:31.160]  And that happened several weeks in a row.
[06:31.300 --> 06:34.480]  What they meant by you're too early is you're not signed in.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.880]  That is how they communicate.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.460]  You're not signed in to make picks.
[06:37.660 --> 06:41.980]  I didn't realize I wasn't signed in, so I just didn't make picks for like three weeks
[06:41.980 --> 06:43.420]  and a tank by season.
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.980]  There's no coming back from that.
[06:45.340 --> 06:46.880]  And that's definitely their fault.
[06:47.840 --> 06:50.640]  The phrase you're not signed in as you're too early.
[06:50.780 --> 06:52.060]  Yes, that is their fault.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.040]  OK, that is an insane way to phrase it.
[06:55.260 --> 06:58.800]  So wait, so like you're like halfway through week two and it's still saying you're too
[06:58.800 --> 07:01.900]  early and you're just like, damn, man, I wonder when we start picking these.
[07:02.020 --> 07:07.340]  Well, no, it's because I would never because I have no awareness of what the college football
[07:07.340 --> 07:08.480]  schedule is.
[07:08.760 --> 07:13.500]  I would remember late, like at the end of the week at like 1 a.m.
[07:13.520 --> 07:15.420]  I go, oh, fuck, I got to do picks.
[07:15.740 --> 07:18.220]  And then I'd go to do it and it would say you're too early.
[07:18.420 --> 07:21.400]  And I'd go, OK, I guess I'm early.
[07:21.480 --> 07:21.880]  I don't know.
[07:22.200 --> 07:23.800]  I've no idea what's happening with the schedule.
[07:23.940 --> 07:25.380]  Wait, you would go too late.
[07:25.800 --> 07:28.180]  You would scramble to make your picks.
[07:28.660 --> 07:31.200]  And you would think because you're so late, you're early.
[07:31.600 --> 07:36.700]  It was a never ending cycle of I never knew when the game started or ended because I couldn't
[07:36.700 --> 07:39.920]  look into it because I was scared if I did research, I would lose.
[07:40.380 --> 07:44.940]  But then I would just never submit picks because I never knew when I was early or late.
[07:45.380 --> 07:47.520]  It wasn't like NFL where I knew on a Saturday night.
[07:47.580 --> 07:49.000]  OK, no, this isn't.
[07:49.040 --> 07:50.440]  They start tomorrow, these games.
[07:50.660 --> 07:52.920]  I never teacher.
[07:53.080 --> 07:57.160]  I never turned in my homework because I was I wasn't sure what day.
[07:57.160 --> 08:02.060]  I knew a day it was due, but I didn't know when if I was too early or late.
[08:02.160 --> 08:03.960]  So I just sort of I held on to my homework.
[08:04.000 --> 08:05.660]  And I don't know why you did that to me.
[08:05.900 --> 08:08.680]  I don't want to I don't want to turn on my homework too early because I was scared you
[08:08.680 --> 08:09.300]  might lose it.
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.600]  So I just held on to it forever.
[08:10.720 --> 08:12.600]  We focus on that.
[08:12.700 --> 08:16.120]  It's insane to say you're not signed in by saying you're too early.
[08:16.480 --> 08:20.960]  In professional sports where a team got the day wrong.
[08:20.960 --> 08:28.720]  Oh, I bet I had a really dumb football question for you, Gavin,
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.700]  that I don't think even makes sense.
[08:30.900 --> 08:31.660]  Wait, which football?
[08:32.240 --> 08:34.620]  The one, you know, that's why I'd be asking you.
[08:34.760 --> 08:37.280]  OK, yeah, not the NFL.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:39.520 --> 08:40.720]  Hit me with it.
[08:41.320 --> 08:42.280]  Then this is my thought.
[08:42.340 --> 08:44.640]  And this is what, you know, Johnny Caviar came from.
[08:44.860 --> 08:47.000]  I woke up and that was just the first thing in my brain.
[08:47.300 --> 08:50.120]  I woke up either today or yesterday.
[08:50.120 --> 08:51.680]  I don't remember as groggy.
[08:51.960 --> 08:55.640]  And I thought, has there ever been, you know, the expression,
[08:55.860 --> 08:57.720]  a stitch in time saves nine?
[08:58.180 --> 08:58.940]  I think that's the expression.
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.860]  Has there ever been a time in a football game
[09:01.860 --> 09:07.000]  where a save in time has prevented nine penalty shots from occurring?
[09:07.220 --> 09:11.780]  Like a shot at the end of the game that was made and stopped?
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.840]  I guess we wouldn't know.
[09:14.080 --> 09:14.360]  Wouldn't we?
[09:15.940 --> 09:17.040]  Has there ever been?
[09:17.100 --> 09:17.900]  Let me reverse this.
[09:18.100 --> 09:19.540]  Has there ever been a missed one?
[09:20.120 --> 09:22.120]  Where there have been nine penalty shots taken
[09:22.120 --> 09:24.260]  because somebody flubbed at the last second?
[09:25.640 --> 09:27.880]  Has has something happened in the last second
[09:27.880 --> 09:30.100]  that caused a penalty shoot out of nine shots?
[09:30.100 --> 09:30.900]  Is that what you're asking?
[09:31.380 --> 09:32.280]  That is what I'm asking.
[09:32.620 --> 09:33.600]  Oh, I'm sure of it.
[09:33.860 --> 09:34.640]  Has to have.
[09:34.980 --> 09:35.100]  Yeah.
[09:36.640 --> 09:37.060]  I like that.
[09:37.100 --> 09:39.380]  That was like the first thing you thought of this morning.
[09:39.780 --> 09:41.200]  That was in my head.
[09:41.300 --> 09:45.240]  I realized at the time I was like, oh, it's just like the expression.
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.340]  A save in a save in time saves nine.
[09:49.960 --> 09:52.560]  It's just like the expression.
[09:53.160 --> 09:53.420]  And then.
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.620]  That's so funny because the first thing I thought of this morning was just as much nonsense.
[09:57.860 --> 10:02.880]  I woke up almost panicked, wondering why they didn't call the second super troopers.
[10:03.820 --> 10:05.220]  Super troopers, troopers.
[10:10.180 --> 10:12.220]  And then I was like, well, that doesn't make any sense.
[10:12.260 --> 10:13.020]  What am I talking about?
[10:13.540 --> 10:16.280]  It would be better if it was troopers troopers.
[10:16.320 --> 10:16.580]  Yeah.
[10:17.440 --> 10:18.820]  Super duper troopers.
[10:19.340 --> 10:21.620]  That's not what you went with?
[10:22.160 --> 10:22.440]  Super.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.000]  Oh, like French, too.
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.960]  Oh, is that what duper is?
[10:28.700 --> 10:29.580]  No, I mean.
[10:29.720 --> 10:31.160]  Yeah, that's what duper means.
[10:32.180 --> 10:33.600]  It's two in French.
[10:33.900 --> 10:34.420]  Duper.
[10:37.940 --> 10:39.960]  I've been watching a lot of the Olympics.
[10:40.080 --> 10:41.180]  I'm picking up on this stuff.
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.660]  Oh, man.
[10:46.780 --> 10:47.340]  Soccer blue.
[10:47.460 --> 10:49.120]  We went by duper last night.
[10:49.340 --> 10:53.840]  Oh, duper is wild.
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.440]  So this freaking movie thing, I can't believe how tight it is.
[11:03.560 --> 11:07.480]  You're now beating me by what, like 20 something mil?
[11:08.000 --> 11:08.980]  Yeah, barely, dude.
[11:09.020 --> 11:10.600]  And I'm right there, like on your heels.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.500]  So we're all bunched up.
[11:13.700 --> 11:15.200]  Andrew has two movies.
[11:15.940 --> 11:17.340]  Luckily, I got my plus nine.
[11:17.440 --> 11:17.940]  You know what I mean?
[11:17.940 --> 11:23.260]  Andrew has two movies that are more than Eric's total and Jeff's total.
[11:23.840 --> 11:23.860]  Yeah.
[11:24.140 --> 11:29.640]  You have one movie that is more than Jeff and Eric's combined.
[11:31.700 --> 11:33.020]  Maybe even Jeff.
[11:33.140 --> 11:34.660]  It's close between Jeff and Nick.
[11:35.620 --> 11:38.420]  I'm kind of counting here on my alien, right?
[11:38.520 --> 11:38.920]  It is.
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.200]  It's going to come down to alien.
[11:40.460 --> 11:40.660]  Yeah.
[11:40.720 --> 11:42.140]  If it makes under 100 million.
[11:42.400 --> 11:43.540]  Me too. And I'm counting on the crow.
[11:44.780 --> 11:46.820]  And I'm counting on Beetlejuice.
[11:47.480 --> 11:49.180]  Oh boy, you're fucked.
[11:49.580 --> 11:51.320]  Yeah, you're fucked. I'm in it, though.
[11:51.700 --> 11:55.640]  What do you think the chances are Beetlejuice could make 700 million domestic?
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.220]  It would require every person to see it as many times as you have to say it.
[12:02.360 --> 12:03.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.960]  Triple view from everyone.
[12:05.520 --> 12:10.200]  I also think what you're not counting is like, I'm like, oh, the crow, the crow.
[12:10.380 --> 12:12.060]  Dude, I got Reagan still.
[12:12.220 --> 12:12.980]  You might be fucked.
[12:13.140 --> 12:15.700]  People might be like, politics are hot right now.
[12:15.940 --> 12:16.300]  They are.
[12:16.300 --> 12:19.180]  People, people might want to go see, OK, what's this?
[12:19.960 --> 12:22.680]  I got to see what's up with this Reagan guy.
[12:22.860 --> 12:26.100]  And they might net me a lot of money.
[12:26.380 --> 12:27.380]  I might blow by Jeff.
[12:28.100 --> 12:32.600]  I've never had this happen, but it just occurred to me how funny it would be
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.100]  if it came down to hundreds of dollars between two people.
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.740]  And just the idea of like, you actually could sway the box office by personally buying tickets.
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.940]  You throwing money at this thing could result in winning.
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.840]  And we've got our dollar amount leftovers.
[12:48.200 --> 12:49.500]  That's true, yeah.
[12:50.920 --> 12:51.540]  You're monopoly.
[12:52.140 --> 12:53.400]  You should have kept some points, Andrew.
[12:53.480 --> 12:54.380]  You might be fucked at the end.
[12:54.460 --> 12:56.560]  That Gavin's 15 might steamroll you, right?
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.380]  Just squeeze right over there.
[12:58.380 --> 13:01.900]  Oh, Gavin, I didn't even remember that he has 15 points.
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.640]  That's so funny.
[13:03.620 --> 13:04.720]  You really wasted that.
[13:04.780 --> 13:05.680]  You could have got Twister.
[13:06.520 --> 13:08.160]  I was just waiting for the big hitters.
[13:10.100 --> 13:11.800]  Twister's to 200 plus mil.
[13:12.040 --> 13:12.580]  That's insane.
[13:12.600 --> 13:13.200]  That's nine points.
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.400]  That was I actually felt better if I lose to you.
[13:17.520 --> 13:21.260]  I looked at the price of everything and my mistakes,
[13:21.380 --> 13:25.820]  which were the Watchers and Fly Me to the Moon for nine total points.
[13:25.820 --> 13:27.760]  But there's still got the best value.
[13:27.860 --> 13:29.760]  Who got the most money per point?
[13:30.620 --> 13:35.480]  It has to be Twister's at nine, right?
[13:36.040 --> 13:39.020]  Nine points at 222 million dollars.
[13:39.100 --> 13:39.560]  That's insane.
[13:39.780 --> 13:41.680]  That's insane compared to Wolverine.
[13:42.250 --> 13:47.020]  Oh, Deadpool and Wolverine is 494 million at the time of this recording.
[13:47.400 --> 13:49.940]  494 million at 68 points.
[13:49.940 --> 13:52.380]  We got to check how much Eric spent on Borderlands.
[13:52.480 --> 13:52.800]  One sec.
[13:53.000 --> 13:53.940]  Yeah, that's right.
[13:54.180 --> 13:55.480]  Borderlands might save me.
[13:55.940 --> 13:56.400]  Borderlands.
[13:56.660 --> 13:57.320]  What did Borderlands do?
[13:57.340 --> 13:57.940]  Eight million.
[13:58.180 --> 13:58.600]  Is that right?
[13:58.720 --> 14:01.460]  Yeah, see, I'm sneaking up slow.
[14:01.740 --> 14:03.740]  Ooh, I'm creeping into people are going to go.
[14:03.840 --> 14:05.340]  Oh man, I heard Borderlands is good.
[14:05.380 --> 14:06.780]  I got to go see that, right?
[14:07.340 --> 14:10.500]  Looking at you spend double digit points on Borderlands
[14:10.500 --> 14:13.180]  and it makes single million digit amounts of money.
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.540]  I feel like even you overpaid for Borderlands.
[14:15.880 --> 14:16.660]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[14:16.940 --> 14:18.640]  And you are in the hole.
[14:18.640 --> 14:21.260]  I mean, at that point, at that point, you're just low on the board.
[14:21.340 --> 14:22.420]  You're taking swings, right?
[14:22.460 --> 14:23.160]  You're just sort of like.
[14:23.560 --> 14:23.920]  Yeah, it was.
[14:24.140 --> 14:24.220]  Yeah.
[14:24.220 --> 14:24.560]  Yeah.
[14:24.560 --> 14:24.680]  Yeah.
[14:24.680 --> 14:25.120]  I'll take it.
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.160]  It was a point tracker, Jim.
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.180]  Could we commission the people that made these sites to have them?
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.340]  Like, what if we had it on our website?
[14:34.560 --> 14:34.980]  That'd be cool.
[14:35.300 --> 14:36.400]  I'd love to do something like that.
[14:36.400 --> 14:37.720]  What's our website?
[14:38.540 --> 14:39.340]  Regulatrion.com
[14:40.780 --> 14:43.200]  Yeah, or yeah, whatever we've got.
[14:43.280 --> 14:44.340]  We don't have a website, do we?
[14:45.580 --> 14:46.760]  What is happening?
[14:47.140 --> 14:48.800]  What website do you think we have?
[14:48.800 --> 14:51.660]  I was thinking of that old landing page that we had for the old.
[14:52.000 --> 14:53.300]  Roosterteeth.com?
[14:53.740 --> 14:54.360]  Well, it was.
[14:54.500 --> 14:54.920]  Slash.
[14:55.540 --> 14:57.660]  It was FacePod.com, wasn't it?
[14:58.020 --> 14:59.180]  Oh, yes.
[14:59.180 --> 15:01.080]  Which took you to Roosterteeth.com.
[15:01.640 --> 15:03.500]  All right, well, take it somewhere else now.
[15:03.580 --> 15:09.200]  And we can have all of the current feeds of all of the current fake money draft shite.
[15:09.860 --> 15:10.860]  I love it.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.220]  I think that's a great idea.
[15:12.740 --> 15:15.780]  I also, yeah, it'd be cool to have that on our Patreon or something.
[15:16.960 --> 15:17.340]  In some form.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.520]  Yeah, do you ever look at your health as like a percentage?
[15:22.380 --> 15:24.240]  No, and that's my problem.
[15:24.500 --> 15:25.280]  That is my problem.
[15:25.340 --> 15:26.920]  Hang on, hang on.
[15:27.660 --> 15:29.680]  Don't you only look at your health in a percent?
[15:29.680 --> 15:31.520]  We talk about your ankle percents only.
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.720]  No, OK, I think we've talked about this before, too.
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.340]  If we talk about this constantly.
[15:36.340 --> 15:42.340]  If the human body worked like crackdown or like where I get a skill point for doing something
[15:42.340 --> 15:46.060]  that I could apply somewhere, I would be in the best shape.
[15:47.100 --> 15:49.660]  That's the timeline in which I'm in the Olympics.
[15:50.160 --> 15:51.060]  Wait, why would you what?
[15:51.620 --> 15:52.440]  I don't understand.
[15:52.560 --> 15:54.300]  Didn't you just say percents?
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.200]  No, this is what I'm saying.
[15:57.200 --> 15:58.600]  You got to level up, right?
[15:58.700 --> 16:00.140]  In a game with percentages.
[16:00.760 --> 16:01.960]  That's what you're talking about.
[16:01.960 --> 16:09.100]  If you'd seen percentages, if I could see that my strength is 20% of what could be 100%.
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.380]  What's 100% though?
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.380]  The strongest you could be or the strongest anyone could be?
[16:13.560 --> 16:15.440]  The strongest I could possibly be.
[16:15.600 --> 16:19.140]  I think everyone would have their own limits within their frame.
[16:19.600 --> 16:26.660]  I would assume I'm not a doctor, but if I could see that and if I could if I could do,
[16:26.820 --> 16:31.260]  let's say, like a bicep curl and see like I went up a quarter of a point,
[16:31.260 --> 16:33.700]  then I would be chasing those things like achievements.
[16:34.380 --> 16:35.980]  I need that visual chase.
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.040]  Let me ask you a question.
[16:37.200 --> 16:38.780]  What's your ankle integrity at right now?
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.820]  That's what I'm saying.
[16:41.060 --> 16:41.640]  Like what?
[16:42.500 --> 16:43.740]  Well, but that's health.
[16:43.980 --> 16:44.780]  That's a health bar.
[16:45.280 --> 16:46.380]  I'm gonna throw up.
[16:47.740 --> 16:50.000]  My current health is zero percent.
[16:50.480 --> 16:51.760]  I'm gonna throw up.
[16:52.160 --> 16:53.900]  I'm so I'm like seeing red.
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.060]  I'm gonna flip.
[16:55.500 --> 16:59.620]  There's a green filter over the picture of his head right now and his cheeks got a little...
[17:01.260 --> 17:05.460]  You've given an answer that's so weird that I don't even know where I was going with that.
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.480]  I think you're talking about glory holes.
[17:08.300 --> 17:09.620]  I was talking about bread rolls.
[17:10.200 --> 17:10.600]  Glory.
[17:10.900 --> 17:12.320]  Yeah, bread rolls and glory holes.
[17:12.560 --> 17:18.980]  Oh, I was I think I think the other day I got so hot while I was mowing.
[17:19.380 --> 17:24.400]  It was, you know, pushing 40 degrees again, just sweat, just sweating constantly,
[17:24.540 --> 17:26.620]  like not a moment where a drip isn't coming off me.
[17:26.880 --> 17:29.920]  And by the end of it, I thought, how close to death am I right now?
[17:30.530 --> 17:34.780]  I felt like if if my health was a percentage that started the morning at 100,
[17:35.220 --> 17:38.620]  I must have been at like 65 percent.
[17:39.320 --> 17:39.680]  Yeah.
[17:40.100 --> 17:43.460]  Like if I kept going for much longer, would I eventually have died?
[17:43.860 --> 17:46.040]  And you could drop really fast, too.
[17:46.140 --> 17:50.220]  You could go from like 65 to like 30 in like a couple seconds.
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.520]  I was watching a reality TV show the other day about like a race through Alaska.
[17:54.760 --> 17:56.240]  And it was this married couple.
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.440]  And the lady was complaining about needing electrolytes and feeling like
[17:59.440 --> 18:00.320]  she was a little lightheaded.
[18:00.480 --> 18:01.740]  And he's like, oh, you're fine.
[18:01.800 --> 18:02.100]  Keep going.
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.080]  And then 30 seconds later, she passed out and they had to like helicopter her out.
[18:07.180 --> 18:11.460]  She spent three days in the ICU just from having a heatstroke.
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.840]  It fucking shut her whole body down.
[18:14.260 --> 18:17.720]  So health is like an iPhone that's a couple of years old.
[18:17.800 --> 18:20.060]  It gets to like nine percent and then just turns off.
[18:20.340 --> 18:24.280]  Yeah, your health is like an iPhone where when you get below 20 percent, you have no idea.
[18:24.780 --> 18:24.980]  Yeah.
[18:24.980 --> 18:28.400]  You think that was the the worst take by that guy of all time?
[18:28.880 --> 18:30.400]  Yeah, I'm assuming he didn't.
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.360]  That was an all time bad take.
[18:31.380 --> 18:34.080]  He didn't endear himself to all the wives of the world watching it.
[18:34.140 --> 18:38.460]  I'm sure he it didn't it didn't come across super well in the in the episode.
[18:38.780 --> 18:42.300]  But but it's just crazy because you're I was I was so flabbergasted by that because you're
[18:42.300 --> 18:45.900]  watching it and you're like these people are in the like these people are racing across Alaska
[18:45.900 --> 18:48.320]  doing like 20 miles a day through the wilderness.
[18:48.340 --> 18:51.440]  And it's insane what they're physically capable of.
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.540]  And then one, you just shows you like even if you're in amazing shape,
[18:55.580 --> 19:02.040]  you just get a little bit over over your skis and suddenly you're super fucked, you know?
[19:04.440 --> 19:05.120]  God damn.
[19:05.220 --> 19:10.780]  Yeah, I guess that for me, going back to the level up system, seeing the number go up
[19:12.180 --> 19:13.700]  is exciting to me.
[19:13.740 --> 19:16.020]  Seeing the number go down does nothing for me.
[19:16.100 --> 19:16.560]  I don't care.
[19:17.100 --> 19:17.940]  What do you mean?
[19:18.660 --> 19:20.320]  Because death is inevitable.
[19:20.320 --> 19:23.960]  The number is going to hit zero no matter what at some stage.
[19:24.300 --> 19:29.040]  But if I could do something that rate, oh, I guess that would be it, right?
[19:29.060 --> 19:34.600]  Like if I could do things and I would see the number go up, what my health percentage was,
[19:35.100 --> 19:36.120]  then that'd be something.
[19:37.100 --> 19:38.900]  I'm only thinking about it in a singular way, though.
[19:39.580 --> 19:40.700]  Oh, you don't say?
[19:42.120 --> 19:45.640]  If it went both ways, if it teeter tottered, although that wouldn't be fun.
[19:45.860 --> 19:48.300]  Imagine being like 32 dogs into your year
[19:48.300 --> 19:50.720]  and just seeing it go down after one bite.
[19:51.140 --> 19:55.740]  Yeah, if you were eating six dogs a day and then you woke up and you had like 12%,
[19:55.740 --> 19:58.100]  surely you would be panicked by the decreasing number.
[19:58.440 --> 20:02.420]  You don't need to have a number in front of you to know that you're not well
[20:02.420 --> 20:03.940]  from eating so many hot dogs.
[20:04.400 --> 20:10.360]  But I think it would be interesting to see or to be able to know how many dogs would kill you.
[20:11.080 --> 20:15.380]  I don't want to throw a Skittle in and see my number go down because of a singular Skittle.
[20:15.520 --> 20:17.700]  Now Skittles are off. I can't enjoy Skittles now.
[20:17.700 --> 20:20.720]  I don't think a Skittle would dent out an entire percentage.
[20:21.320 --> 20:22.700]  But it could be the straw.
[20:23.200 --> 20:28.580]  We know a human being can eat as many as 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes
[20:28.580 --> 20:31.920]  and still be considered an athlete. So it can't be too negative.
[20:32.060 --> 20:35.460]  That's a year's worth of hot dogs Joey Chestnut ate in 10 minutes.
[20:36.020 --> 20:36.940]  And he seems fine.
[20:37.580 --> 20:40.140]  I saw the old dog count go up a couple of times recently.
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.360]  Well, yeah, yeah, I dipped in the dogs this weekend a little bit.
[20:44.400 --> 20:45.320]  Where were you dogging?
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.940]  I dogged at home, baby. I made hot dogs.
[20:48.340 --> 20:49.060]  You're home dogging?
[20:49.280 --> 20:51.360]  I was home dogging, yeah. I went and got some Oscar Myers.
[20:52.920 --> 20:56.800]  That also needs to be a live updated thing on our website.
[20:57.320 --> 20:58.020]  The dog count?
[20:58.460 --> 20:58.620]  Yeah.
[20:59.260 --> 21:00.800]  All right. And what's our website again?
[21:00.960 --> 21:01.220]  Stats.
[21:02.360 --> 21:08.580]  Dude, I don't want to take too much shit from my other podcast.
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.060]  But I was doing hot dog work on the other podcast.
[21:14.060 --> 21:15.320]  The So All Right one.
[21:15.920 --> 21:19.540]  And I ran across a fact that blew my fucking mind.
[21:19.700 --> 21:26.080]  You know, I told you guys last time that the average American eats 70 hot dogs a year.
[21:26.920 --> 21:30.580]  But I was looking at what state consumes the most hot dogs.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.240]  It's West Virginia.
[21:32.680 --> 21:37.640]  And do you have any idea how many hot dogs the average West Virginian eats in a year?
[21:38.700 --> 21:39.600]  Ooh, this is a good...
[21:39.600 --> 21:40.820]  Ooh, let's think. Let's guess.
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.180]  Everybody throw down a number.
[21:42.280 --> 21:42.860]  Think about it.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.280]  Don't just throw out a number.
[21:44.420 --> 21:44.800]  Think about it.
[21:44.820 --> 21:47.540]  The average American eats 70 hot dogs a year.
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.420]  And this is...
[21:49.220 --> 21:49.680]  More.
[21:50.400 --> 21:51.000]  111.
[21:51.480 --> 21:52.680]  I'm locking in 88.
[21:53.420 --> 21:53.840]  120.
[21:54.520 --> 21:54.800]  Whoa.
[21:55.600 --> 21:55.940]  Nick?
[21:56.280 --> 21:56.700]  100.
[21:57.400 --> 22:00.120]  I believe it was 481.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.940]  Okay, that's not right.
[22:02.160 --> 22:03.540]  There's a number that somebody hit.
[22:03.540 --> 22:06.440]  According to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council,
[22:06.740 --> 22:10.640]  West Virginians eat 481 hot dogs per person.
[22:10.640 --> 22:14.320]  A cargo plane full of dogs went down in West Virginia,
[22:14.480 --> 22:16.020]  and it somehow got added to the total.
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.860]  Their number is 81.
[22:19.080 --> 22:21.760]  Somebody's finger slipped and hit the four at the beginning,
[22:21.840 --> 22:22.800]  and they didn't delete it.
[22:22.980 --> 22:23.700]  Like, no.
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.320]  My hot dog count is at four,
[22:26.500 --> 22:28.880]  and I'm like, I've been hitting the dogs pretty hard lately.
[22:29.520 --> 22:31.460]  And in like two weeks, it's...
[22:31.460 --> 22:34.440]  That stat is bollocks.
[22:34.660 --> 22:36.640]  It can't be real, but it's on a website.
[22:37.720 --> 22:39.140]  Well, that makes it real.
[22:40.040 --> 22:42.020]  It's on a hot dog council website.
[22:42.120 --> 22:43.000]  How can it not be real?
[22:43.960 --> 22:45.600]  How many hot dog councils are there?
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.180]  Also, like, I don't understand how they're surveying these people.
[22:49.280 --> 22:52.540]  Like, who's doing an accurate count of all these dogs?
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.480]  Are they just going based off of sales and then assuming?
[22:57.720 --> 23:02.480]  Dude, the National Hot Dog Council's website is hot-dog.org.
[23:05.360 --> 23:09.060]  Dude, you can become a hot dog ambassador.
[23:09.140 --> 23:10.060]  I would like to.
[23:10.220 --> 23:11.380]  I'd like to get into that game.
[23:11.480 --> 23:12.260]  I don't know how to do that.
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.960]  I don't know how to break into the hot dog world.
[23:14.080 --> 23:20.500]  But it should be clear from the past month of my life that I'm trying really hard to lean into it.
[23:21.100 --> 23:23.340]  What's the best way to wash down your dog?
[23:23.460 --> 23:25.420]  48% say iced tea.
[23:26.340 --> 23:27.220]  It sucks.
[23:27.360 --> 23:28.380]  This website sucks.
[23:28.660 --> 23:29.060]  It does.
[23:29.420 --> 23:33.720]  But it's been a goldmine of information for me for the last two episodes of my other podcast.
[23:34.360 --> 23:35.140]  Oh, man.
[23:36.760 --> 23:37.920]  Hey, it's Paris.
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.560]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[23:40.800 --> 23:41.620]  Like stars.
[23:42.060 --> 23:42.340]  Duh.
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.460]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[23:47.060 --> 23:51.380]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[23:51.860 --> 23:56.100]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[23:56.820 --> 23:59.140]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[23:59.620 --> 24:00.360]  That's hot.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.040]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[24:04.420 --> 24:05.760]  Hilton for the stay.
[24:07.940 --> 24:10.140]  Puede parecer extravagante.
[24:10.580 --> 24:11.960]  Ocho configuraciones diferentes.
[24:12.180 --> 24:13.180]  Intensidad ajustable.
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.660]  Además es calefaccionado.
[24:15.060 --> 24:17.360]  Y se siente tan bien.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.680]  Sí, una silla de masajes puede parecer extravagante.
[24:20.860 --> 24:22.340]  Y dos, bueno, aún más.
[24:22.760 --> 24:24.960]  Pero cuando esas sillas de masajes vienen con un auto,
[24:26.320 --> 24:28.480]  se vuelven bastante prácticas.
[24:28.920 --> 24:32.080]  El nuevo Volkswagen Teguan 2025, con funciones premium,
[24:32.200 --> 24:34.400]  como los asientos delanteros con masaje disponibles,
[24:34.780 --> 24:36.260]  solo parece extravagante.
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.880]  Did you know you could get a domain ending in .sucks?
[24:46.080 --> 24:48.080]  Pot-dog.sucks?
[24:48.320 --> 24:51.120]  Because I've noticed, Eric, that we don't have a website anymore.
[24:51.460 --> 24:52.400]  And I've found...
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.780]  Oh, is that what you've noticed?
[24:54.240 --> 24:58.040]  And I've found that Eric.sucks is available.
[24:59.480 --> 25:02.120]  This whole fucking segment .sucks.
[25:02.960 --> 25:05.020]  Is this .sucks available?
[25:05.420 --> 25:07.500]  That shook the day to Eric right there.
[25:07.500 --> 25:09.100]  This .sucks is taken.
[25:09.420 --> 25:09.800]  Damn it.
[25:10.420 --> 25:10.640]  Damn.
[25:11.340 --> 25:13.880]  Who's got the most... that's $999.
[25:15.220 --> 25:16.100]  What, Eric.sucks?
[25:16.380 --> 25:17.140]  Eric.sucks.
[25:17.260 --> 25:20.080]  But then after a year, it goes up to $2,600 a year.
[25:20.180 --> 25:22.020]  Holy shit, that's crazy.
[25:22.980 --> 25:24.160]  I wonder if Jeff.sucks...
[25:24.160 --> 25:26.980]  Oh, Jeff.sucks is so cheap.
[25:27.480 --> 25:27.980]  How much am I?
[25:28.300 --> 25:31.680]  It's $99 for the first year and then $400.
[25:32.300 --> 25:33.020]  No, that's a steal.
[25:33.400 --> 25:36.720]  Thank God my mom named me that weird ass Jeff spelling.
[25:37.700 --> 25:38.780]  Andrew.sucks.
[25:38.940 --> 25:39.960]  Ooh, another pricey one.
[25:40.480 --> 25:41.000]  Uh-oh.
[25:41.440 --> 25:42.320]  Nick.sucks.
[25:42.600 --> 25:43.700]  Very pricey.
[25:44.540 --> 25:45.460]  What about Gavin?
[25:46.040 --> 25:47.660]  Gavin.sucks is a cheap one.
[25:48.080 --> 25:49.000]  Jeff, we can get ours.
[25:51.400 --> 25:57.100]  So tune on into our website, Gavin.sucks, if you want to join our Patreon.
[25:57.580 --> 25:58.800]  That sounds awesome.
[25:59.360 --> 26:02.480]  I can't believe how much Eric.sucks costs.
[26:02.780 --> 26:04.080]  That's fucking crazy.
[26:04.460 --> 26:05.860]  I think you should have that.
[26:05.860 --> 26:07.860]  I don't want to pay for it.
[26:07.920 --> 26:08.820]  That's a lot of money.
[26:09.300 --> 26:13.580]  If somebody buys it, can you just make it go to our Patreon?
[26:14.100 --> 26:14.960]  I don't care which one.
[26:15.220 --> 26:15.900]  Everybody just stand in for that.
[26:15.900 --> 26:16.600]  That's a big ask.
[26:17.420 --> 26:21.440]  It's $1,000 and then $2,600 to renew.
[26:21.580 --> 26:22.520]  That's outrageous.
[26:22.660 --> 26:23.840]  That's ludicrous.
[26:24.340 --> 26:25.340]  That's fucking crazy.
[26:25.500 --> 26:27.180]  You could buy it. That's a tuxedo right there.
[26:27.320 --> 26:28.300]  Why? It's great.
[26:28.580 --> 26:34.080]  Eric.info, same name, different extension, sold for over $5,000.
[26:34.820 --> 26:36.460]  This info is...
[26:36.460 --> 26:39.360]  But Eric.info fucking sucks.
[26:39.580 --> 26:41.060]  Eric.sucks is way better.
[26:41.480 --> 26:41.720]  Yeah.
[26:42.260 --> 26:45.340]  You can buy half of Caster Troy's pistols for that amount.
[26:45.480 --> 26:50.400]  Here's one that's ericdrains.com, and I don't like the way that sounds.
[26:51.140 --> 26:52.120]  What? No.
[26:52.440 --> 26:53.540]  Eric.drains.
[26:53.840 --> 26:55.480]  Speaking about the smut conference.
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.540]  It's like people, it's like we should design our website based on those grids on that
[27:01.540 --> 27:03.280]  map thing you showed us last week.
[27:03.280 --> 27:03.900]  Oh, God.
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.060]  That's a good idea.
[27:05.240 --> 27:05.980]  What? Three words?
[27:06.240 --> 27:06.420]  Yeah.
[27:06.520 --> 27:07.380]  What was it? Three what?
[27:09.020 --> 27:13.140]  Hey, what's everybody's Doberman count from the last episode?
[27:13.440 --> 27:13.640]  Zero.
[27:13.760 --> 27:14.120]  I got one.
[27:14.240 --> 27:14.920]  One for me.
[27:15.160 --> 27:15.680]  Saw one yesterday.
[27:16.040 --> 27:18.180]  You're really focused in on all things dogs.
[27:18.860 --> 27:19.080]  Yeah.
[27:19.320 --> 27:19.960]  I guess I am.
[27:20.260 --> 27:20.620]  You're in the real dog era.
[27:20.940 --> 27:22.240]  Dog days of summer, bud.
[27:22.780 --> 27:23.560]  It's the dog days.
[27:23.780 --> 27:24.520]  It's dog days of summer.
[27:25.000 --> 27:25.220]  That's right.
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.980]  I also saw something super gross that I'd like to share with you guys if you don't mind.
[27:32.440 --> 27:32.840]  Perfect.
[27:34.080 --> 27:37.060]  Well, first off, I'll say I was hanging out with Gavin for a little bit yesterday,
[27:37.220 --> 27:39.160]  which we should talk about at some point.
[27:39.160 --> 27:46.880]  But on the way to go record the Clutch My Pearls podcast where we revealed our smut to the world,
[27:47.940 --> 27:55.560]  Gavin and I saw a dude walk down the street and we saw 75% of his dick, I'd say,
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.620]  and 100% of his pubic hair as his pants were just barely hanging on to the bell end of his dick.
[28:02.620 --> 28:04.680]  It was like bird's nest and neck.
[28:05.060 --> 28:07.820]  Yeah, it was pretty gross. He didn't give a fuck.
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.200]  But that was the least gross nudity I saw.
[28:12.320 --> 28:15.900]  The other day, Emily and I were going to the... there's a Target downtown.
[28:16.880 --> 28:18.940]  Typically, you don't go to it because it's kind of hard to get in and out of,
[28:19.220 --> 28:20.640]  like a city Target, you know.
[28:20.760 --> 28:24.040]  But she bought something and it was there, so we had to pick it up.
[28:24.140 --> 28:30.360]  And so we're going through the east side and we stop at a light and across the street from us
[28:31.280 --> 28:34.080]  is... it's kind of like where there's a soup kitchen.
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.440]  So there's a lot of people hanging around, you know,
[28:39.440 --> 28:41.400]  just kind of waiting to get a free meal or something.
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.920]  And there was a lady standing, I guess, across the street from us to the right of us,
[28:46.980 --> 28:47.940]  so catty corner to us.
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.560]  And I was in the driver's seat, just kind of minding my own business.
[28:51.760 --> 28:53.320]  And Emily goes, oh, oh my.
[28:53.400 --> 28:58.700]  And I looked over and the lady was smoking a cigarette in her right hand.
[28:58.700 --> 29:02.940]  And then she just pulled her pants down all the way to the ground.
[29:03.180 --> 29:03.520]  Oh, God.
[29:03.660 --> 29:06.880]  And then she squatted with her butt facing the street.
[29:07.400 --> 29:11.680]  And then she just started shitting and smoking a cigarette.
[29:11.700 --> 29:13.740]  And then I shit you not.
[29:14.660 --> 29:15.320]  That was weird.
[29:15.820 --> 29:18.260]  I kid you not.
[29:18.760 --> 29:23.680]  She picks up a newspaper off the ground and she started reading the newspaper with her left hand
[29:23.680 --> 29:29.320]  and smoking with her right hand and shitting with her butt hand.
[29:29.920 --> 29:33.760]  And she just squatted there with her ass facing us and the whole street
[29:33.760 --> 29:35.760]  and just shit for a while.
[29:35.800 --> 29:37.680]  And it was a long red light.
[29:37.700 --> 29:40.760]  And then after a minute, in one of the
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.960]  ballsiest things I've ever seen a human being do without, like, even breaking her stride,
[29:47.560 --> 29:50.680]  mid-cigarette drag, mid, like, reading the paper,
[29:51.200 --> 29:55.220]  she just took that paper and then just started wiping her ass with it
[29:55.220 --> 30:01.420]  and then just left it there and then picked up another piece of newspaper and started reading that.
[30:01.960 --> 30:03.940]  Light turns green. We drove on.
[30:04.740 --> 30:07.320]  Went a couple blocks down, got stopped by a train.
[30:07.620 --> 30:10.080]  I'm going to illustrate this to show the passage of time.
[30:10.340 --> 30:13.180]  Got stopped by, like, a train, one of those light rails.
[30:14.080 --> 30:16.160]  Get past that, turn into Target.
[30:16.260 --> 30:19.500]  This is a Target in the city, so you got to go down into a parking garage,
[30:19.500 --> 30:25.220]  take a ticket, park, go to an elevator, go up into the Target, get the thing that you bought,
[30:25.520 --> 30:29.500]  get your parking validated, go back down, go back out through the parking lot,
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.560]  show the ticket, get out, right?
[30:31.580 --> 30:32.580]  So I had to go through all of that.
[30:32.640 --> 30:36.340]  So at a minimum, we were probably 40 minutes at this point, right?
[30:37.180 --> 30:40.020]  It's the, yeah, the Target Whole Foods combo at, like, East 5th Street.
[30:41.500 --> 30:46.320]  And come back out, go back the way we came, drive the other way past that lady.
[30:46.320 --> 30:51.180]  She was standing, smoking a cigarette, reading the paper still,
[30:51.560 --> 30:53.820]  just with her pants down and just her ass out.
[30:53.900 --> 30:57.420]  Just, like, hanging out, chilling, and it had been probably 40 minutes.
[30:57.520 --> 31:01.600]  So I think that lady's pants had been down for a solid 40, 45 minutes at that point,
[31:01.680 --> 31:04.100]  and they weren't in any danger of going back up.
[31:04.340 --> 31:06.600]  And then we just drove on and went about our business.
[31:07.060 --> 31:10.600]  But that's one of the wildest things I've seen since I saw the homeless guy
[31:10.600 --> 31:14.840]  smoke crack and shit his pants and not break a stride in San Francisco with Gus.
[31:16.660 --> 31:20.420]  I think I've learned to not judge what is and is not an Olympic sport.
[31:20.560 --> 31:23.000]  But to me, that sounds like an Olympian right there.
[31:23.800 --> 31:25.100]  That's genuinely impressive.
[31:25.600 --> 31:26.240]  It was impressive.
[31:26.400 --> 31:30.800]  I don't know if I could squat and shit without falling over into my own shit at this point,
[31:30.840 --> 31:31.160]  you know?
[31:31.380 --> 31:35.400]  Like, I don't know that I have the dexterity to maintain that position for as long as she did.
[31:35.580 --> 31:40.760]  Certainly not while smoking a cigarette and reading the paper in public, you know?
[31:40.760 --> 31:44.260]  Because you're still legs tied together by the undies, right?
[31:44.340 --> 31:45.640]  And the shorts and all that.
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.580]  Or, like, pants.
[31:46.660 --> 31:48.520]  She had what looked like hospital gowns or something.
[31:49.040 --> 31:50.160]  Like drawstring pants.
[31:50.220 --> 31:50.740]  Maybe they weren't hospital pants.
[31:50.740 --> 31:53.680]  I'd be so paranoid about shitting on my waistband.
[31:55.100 --> 31:59.800]  I probably would have been weirded out by doing it in front of people first and foremost.
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.040]  But, like, this lady had a bravado about her that I gotta say I respected.
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.880]  And she was unfazed and unbothered.
[32:08.060 --> 32:12.220]  And just, like, she knew what she wanted to do in the moment.
[32:12.380 --> 32:14.740]  And nothing and no one was gonna stop her.
[32:14.740 --> 32:18.060]  And when she was done, she didn't feel like picking her pants back up.
[32:18.120 --> 32:19.340]  And so she didn't have to.
[32:19.440 --> 32:24.040]  And for all I know, if I went by that corner right now, she'd be standing there.
[32:24.100 --> 32:24.860]  I don't know.
[32:25.260 --> 32:25.700]  Crazy.
[32:26.260 --> 32:31.080]  You don't expect to see a human pooping at you in the street.
[32:31.180 --> 32:31.400]  No.
[32:32.520 --> 32:34.480]  And I feel like they absorbed that newspaper.
[32:34.920 --> 32:39.660]  I can't prove that they did, but I just feel like I know that they whatever they read,
[32:40.040 --> 32:42.180]  they could be quizzed on it.
[32:42.280 --> 32:43.240]  Dude, they were reading.
[32:43.260 --> 32:44.180]  She was reading the newspaper.
[32:44.180 --> 32:48.520]  I'm telling you, it was like she was, like, fucking reading it.
[32:48.580 --> 32:49.380]  She was following it.
[32:49.480 --> 32:51.920]  It was she was she had no care in the world.
[32:51.960 --> 32:52.580]  She was Al Bundy.
[32:52.820 --> 32:54.040]  It was fucking wild.
[32:54.520 --> 32:58.780]  I feel like the anus gets a bad rap for public indecency.
[32:59.000 --> 33:05.580]  Like, I understand why maybe you shouldn't have your penis out when it's erect in public.
[33:05.660 --> 33:06.960]  It's more of a sexual thing.
[33:06.980 --> 33:07.720]  I don't understand.
[33:08.600 --> 33:09.040]  Maybe.
[33:09.660 --> 33:11.380]  Yeah, you do understand that.
[33:11.380 --> 33:11.960]  That's good.
[33:12.060 --> 33:12.380]  That's good.
[33:12.380 --> 33:15.120]  It's good that you figured that one out.
[33:15.320 --> 33:17.040]  I think the qualifier is odd.
[33:18.800 --> 33:21.680]  The fact that you you mentioned it needs to be erect.
[33:21.780 --> 33:23.880]  I think you could have just stopped that penis out.
[33:24.260 --> 33:24.820]  I agree.
[33:25.180 --> 33:28.160]  Well, a penis pissing is so much less offensive than an...
[33:29.160 --> 33:29.680]  Well, anyway.
[33:31.520 --> 33:32.480]  Okay, yeah.
[33:32.580 --> 33:33.520]  No, hey, you know what?
[33:33.800 --> 33:34.280]  Keep going.
[33:34.640 --> 33:40.160]  But an anus, I think, shouldn't have the same shock value as a penis.
[33:40.560 --> 33:41.380]  I don't think it does.
[33:41.380 --> 33:42.140]  Really?
[33:42.880 --> 33:43.080]  No.
[33:43.900 --> 33:44.120]  Huh.
[33:44.600 --> 33:46.040]  I don't think they're equal.
[33:46.600 --> 33:48.860]  I think you'd get arrested for either if they were out.
[33:49.240 --> 33:49.420]  Yeah.
[33:50.060 --> 33:54.020]  Well, there was nobody arresting this lady and she was out for about an hour.
[33:54.680 --> 33:58.060]  But my point is that sometimes people need to shit.
[33:58.180 --> 34:00.680]  Like, it's a food poisoning emergency or you're ill.
[34:00.940 --> 34:03.020]  You just need to whip it down and take a dump.
[34:03.460 --> 34:06.560]  You never need to whip out your erect penis, is my point.
[34:07.040 --> 34:09.200]  Totally acceptable if a dog does it, right?
[34:09.900 --> 34:10.440]  That's what I mean.
[34:10.440 --> 34:11.660]  See, all the time in the animal kingdom.
[34:11.860 --> 34:15.640]  Yeah, you get arrested for either thing is such a bad defense
[34:16.100 --> 34:22.240]  because it implies that, like, there isn't a scale that being arrested is the max of anything.
[34:23.080 --> 34:24.360]  Uh, what do you mean?
[34:24.580 --> 34:28.700]  You could be arrested for anything, but there are different crimes.
[34:28.840 --> 34:30.040]  Can't be arrested for throwing up.
[34:32.400 --> 34:33.760]  Maybe if you throw up on a cop.
[34:33.980 --> 34:34.400]  Yeah.
[34:34.460 --> 34:35.080]  Throw up on a cop.
[34:35.400 --> 34:36.100]  Yeah, or a baby.
[34:36.760 --> 34:37.620]  Oh, a baby?
[34:37.900 --> 34:38.120]  That'd be bad.
[34:38.120 --> 34:38.940]  Someone else's baby.
[34:38.940 --> 34:45.480]  My point is, is that, like, tax evasion and genocide are not the same crimes.
[34:46.040 --> 34:46.320]  Right.
[34:46.420 --> 34:47.780]  But you could be arrested for both.
[34:48.680 --> 34:51.140]  I don't think you just get normal arrested for genocide.
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.160]  I don't think you get regular.
[34:55.560 --> 34:57.220]  You're coming down to county lockup.
[34:58.860 --> 35:01.760]  Everything you say can be used against you.
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.420]  I place you under arrest right now.
[35:05.420 --> 35:11.380]  My point was, Gavin, I said that I think that there's a lot less, uh, with the ass out than
[35:11.380 --> 35:12.240]  there is a dick out.
[35:12.340 --> 35:13.620]  I think it's a lot less offensive.
[35:13.800 --> 35:17.580]  And your argument was, well, you could be arrested if your ass was out.
[35:17.960 --> 35:21.380]  And I'm just saying, I think there's levels to the game, even though, like, you could
[35:21.380 --> 35:23.820]  fall under the category of, yeah, you could be arrested for both.
[35:24.160 --> 35:25.240]  Does not make them equal.
[35:25.740 --> 35:26.500]  Is what I was trying to say.
[35:26.500 --> 35:30.800]  How are they, well, how are they not equal if you can get arrested for both?
[35:30.880 --> 35:33.980]  Like, in what arenas outside of the law are they unequal?
[35:34.540 --> 35:37.980]  I think if we did a cer- Nick, get that survey going.
[35:38.560 --> 35:40.280]  Get the survey post going.
[35:41.000 --> 35:41.740]  Yeah, this is good.
[35:41.820 --> 35:42.940]  What do you want him to write?
[35:43.100 --> 35:45.020]  He'll post this one too, like his corndog.
[35:45.980 --> 35:47.920]  Like a what's more shocking or like a-
[35:47.920 --> 35:50.500]  Yeah, what is more offensive?
[35:52.280 --> 35:55.240]  Dick out, butt out, or equally offensive?
[35:56.160 --> 35:59.140]  Now we're specifying how erect the penis is.
[35:59.240 --> 36:00.820]  No, I don't think we need to.
[36:01.060 --> 36:02.200]  And are we adding vagina?
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.380]  It seems weird to specify how erect the penis would be because there's no-
[36:06.380 --> 36:08.600]  What's the butthole equivalent of an erect penis?
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.700]  Well, if someone was using a urinal next to you with a full-blown stork on,
[36:15.140 --> 36:18.320]  that would be much more shocking than if someone was just taking a piss.
[36:18.380 --> 36:19.560]  I don't think it would be.
[36:19.880 --> 36:21.380]  I think I'd be equally uncomfortable.
[36:21.960 --> 36:23.940]  Well, I just think like, like it's a-
[36:23.940 --> 36:27.880]  Like you see somebody with an asshole out in public, they're probably pooping, right?
[36:27.960 --> 36:30.220]  Like in the instance that I saw the asshole, it was pooping.
[36:30.680 --> 36:34.220]  You see a penis out in public, chances are it's peeing,
[36:34.440 --> 36:38.220]  which would be different than seeing an erect penis.
[36:38.840 --> 36:40.660]  But I think the one-to-one comparison,
[36:40.860 --> 36:43.820]  because in this situation, the lady was pooping, would be a peeing penis.
[36:44.800 --> 36:47.680]  But then that's not nearly as offensive as an erect penis,
[36:47.720 --> 36:49.080]  which is more interesting to talk about.
[36:49.340 --> 36:51.560]  So what would be the butthole equivalent of erect penis?
[36:51.640 --> 36:53.640]  I think it would have to be like a gaping butthole,
[36:53.720 --> 36:55.220]  like you were holding your butthole open.
[36:55.540 --> 36:56.540]  Or a finger in the ass.
[36:56.660 --> 36:59.220]  Oh, like a finger in the ass. Yeah, maybe that.
[37:00.320 --> 37:02.000]  Nick, can you write all this down for your Twitter?
[37:02.420 --> 37:05.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will say that Nick was ready to post this,
[37:05.660 --> 37:10.680]  and then the erectness of the penis made him hold up for posting it.
[37:11.520 --> 37:14.200]  So there might be something to it.
[37:14.520 --> 37:14.900]  That, yeah.
[37:15.820 --> 37:18.280]  Oh, you know what? Yeah, that's it.
[37:18.860 --> 37:20.540]  I just feel like there's gonna be leniency
[37:20.540 --> 37:22.920]  if the cop knows that you have food poisoning.
[37:23.420 --> 37:24.480]  Did you say cock or cup?
[37:25.220 --> 37:25.660]  What?
[37:25.980 --> 37:26.160]  What?
[37:30.220 --> 37:32.220]  Oh, I had bad oysters. I'm gonna shoot.
[37:48.100 --> 37:52.120]  Anyway, let us know in the comments of this video which is more offensive.
[37:54.740 --> 37:59.400]  What is offensive is all this slander I've been hearing from Gavin
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.720]  about Beverly Hills Cop 3.
[38:02.780 --> 38:04.440]  So you've now watched them, right?
[38:04.820 --> 38:07.740]  I've seen every one now. Yeah, I've watched all four films.
[38:08.320 --> 38:10.660]  Not a good movie, Beverly Hills Cop 3,
[38:10.800 --> 38:15.740]  but I didn't know at the time, but I stand by the fact that I'm right.
[38:15.980 --> 38:20.400]  I think Beverly Hills Cop 3 is the best action scenes in that entire series.
[38:20.620 --> 38:23.520]  When you told me this on Slack, what did I type back to you?
[38:23.540 --> 38:25.440]  You're a fucking idiot, I believe is what you said.
[38:25.960 --> 38:26.600]  And then?
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.380]  I don't remember. You seem to have all this in your mind.
[38:30.440 --> 38:30.940]  Why don't you say?
[38:31.540 --> 38:33.300]  I wrote respectfully afterwards.
[38:33.420 --> 38:35.320]  Oh, respectfully, yeah, I forgot that.
[38:36.720 --> 38:38.400]  I dropped that from my brain.
[38:39.820 --> 38:45.060]  He told us earlier today that his made-up opinion became his real opinion after he watched the movie.
[38:45.060 --> 38:45.660]  It doesn't make any sense.
[38:45.900 --> 38:46.240]  Shockingly.
[38:46.420 --> 38:50.500]  There's maybe, I could say some of the action's good where he's like hopping about on the
[38:50.500 --> 38:51.980]  Ferris wheel, but it's not.
[38:52.180 --> 38:56.060]  The best kill in the entire series happens in three, by far.
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.220]  On the night of the kill.
[38:57.620 --> 38:59.700]  And it's part of the best sequence in the whole movie.
[38:59.760 --> 39:00.120]  I don't know.
[39:00.220 --> 39:01.880]  Listen, maybe you're on your phone.
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.880]  Maybe you weren't giving it the attention you deserve.
[39:03.900 --> 39:04.620]  I'm never on my phone.
[39:04.620 --> 39:11.540]  But the opening shootout with the cars where it goes from the cars to the shootout to the
[39:11.540 --> 39:14.840]  car driving sequence, best sequence in the movie.
[39:15.180 --> 39:16.100]  I think it's funny.
[39:16.180 --> 39:17.540]  I like that his airbag goes off.
[39:17.560 --> 39:18.800]  You don't see that many chases.
[39:19.180 --> 39:21.780]  I like that the car takes real damage.
[39:22.380 --> 39:27.300]  And there's a scene where he fucking runs over a guy like he shoots the guy that falls
[39:27.300 --> 39:30.580]  out of a truck and then he crushes him with his car.
[39:30.980 --> 39:33.240]  And it's it is graphic.
[39:34.480 --> 39:38.500]  God, there's a fucking I'm not going to spoil it for Gavin, but there's a there's a run
[39:38.500 --> 39:41.940]  over scene at the end of The Sopranos that I saw the other night that fucking grossed
[39:41.940 --> 39:42.240]  me out.
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.180]  I did not expect coming.
[39:44.400 --> 39:47.660]  It's so funny that you're watching The Sopranos for the first time.
[39:48.080 --> 39:48.720]  No, not me.
[39:48.740 --> 39:49.480]  I've seen it before.
[39:49.620 --> 39:51.820]  I just had never watched the last four episodes.
[39:52.160 --> 39:53.900]  Oh, Emily's first time.
[39:54.060 --> 39:54.240]  Wow.
[39:54.300 --> 39:54.740]  Got it.
[39:55.360 --> 39:57.280]  You just got all the way and then you went close enough.
[39:57.760 --> 39:58.860]  Yeah, I read it on Wikipedia.
[39:58.960 --> 39:59.640]  I got sick of waiting.
[40:00.580 --> 40:01.320]  I get it.
[40:01.880 --> 40:05.040]  That show completely turned me off that the last season with how long they took.
[40:05.540 --> 40:09.000]  I think I think if you were watching it in real time, it would be like lost or you're
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.560]  just like, I'm going insane waiting for this.
[40:10.760 --> 40:11.720]  Yeah, it was fucking bullshit.
[40:11.780 --> 40:13.120]  The last two seasons were rough.
[40:13.220 --> 40:19.440]  They took like extended breaks and AJ and Meadow were growing about five years season
[40:19.440 --> 40:20.000]  to season.
[40:20.580 --> 40:24.760]  AJ was AJ had gray hair by the time the fucking last season rolled around.
[40:24.840 --> 40:25.340]  It's insane.
[40:25.760 --> 40:26.340]  It took so long.
[40:26.360 --> 40:26.620]  It's tough.
[40:27.020 --> 40:27.340]  It's tough.
[40:27.340 --> 40:31.440]  It was insane watching Axel F though, because I finally watched that one.
[40:31.760 --> 40:31.840]  Yeah.
[40:31.920 --> 40:38.100]  And watching what looks like the exact same Eddie Murphy next to a bunch of graying old
[40:38.100 --> 40:38.460]  dudes.
[40:38.680 --> 40:39.360]  It's insane.
[40:43.320 --> 40:46.740]  I think the fourth one is the worst one, in my opinion.
[40:47.520 --> 40:47.720]  Nah.
[40:47.840 --> 40:48.520]  I didn't like it at all.
[40:49.620 --> 40:49.840]  Nah.
[40:50.160 --> 40:50.920]  I gotta see it still.
[40:51.440 --> 40:52.620]  And the fourth one is real bad.
[40:53.100 --> 40:55.200]  It had some nice callbacks that it was done in a...
[40:55.200 --> 40:57.640]  You don't get credit for callbacks.
[40:58.580 --> 40:58.860]  What?
[40:59.380 --> 41:00.680]  You don't get credit for callbacks.
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.760]  Callbacks are so lazy.
[41:02.140 --> 41:03.460]  I don't give points for callbacks.
[41:03.920 --> 41:05.740]  I mean, it's a 30 year time gap.
[41:05.800 --> 41:07.960]  I think that's I think we deserve a cheeky callback.
[41:07.980 --> 41:10.620]  Well, you get like, oh, I'm going to give you three points because you say,
[41:10.800 --> 41:12.240]  oh, did he take you to a strip club?
[41:12.740 --> 41:13.720]  You don't get points for that.
[41:14.040 --> 41:16.940]  Dude, callbacks are half of this fucking podcast.
[41:17.160 --> 41:17.900]  What are you talking about?
[41:18.020 --> 41:20.940]  Like, don't don't shit on all we got going for us.
[41:21.020 --> 41:22.500]  How are your ankles percentage wise?
[41:23.240 --> 41:24.660]  Pretty good, 99%.
[41:26.660 --> 41:32.760]  Speaking of callbacks, I do want to call back to a fan who,
[41:33.740 --> 41:36.500]  if you remember, sunburned himself.
[41:38.000 --> 41:43.320]  This is this is Jake Jarvis Farm D.
[41:43.780 --> 41:44.160]  Yeah.
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.780]  He also did something recently because he's been practicing tattooing himself.
[41:48.780 --> 41:49.920]  Oh no.
[41:50.160 --> 41:53.440]  So on his own leg, he gave himself an Ian.
[41:53.700 --> 41:56.320]  And I think it's, you know, it's pretty it's it's decent.
[41:56.400 --> 41:57.220]  You know, good for him.
[41:57.400 --> 41:58.380]  It looks about as good as mine.
[41:58.740 --> 41:59.300]  Yeah, it's great.
[41:59.500 --> 42:02.260]  Hey, hey, he gave himself the pencil also.
[42:02.460 --> 42:03.540]  I think the pencil looks great.
[42:03.860 --> 42:04.800]  Yeah, sure does.
[42:04.840 --> 42:05.680]  Number 16 pencil.
[42:06.180 --> 42:09.520]  At the same time, his what he has described as,
[42:10.380 --> 42:13.100]  I got some regulation podcast tattoos.
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.360]  My younger brother tattooed my left butt cheek with Regulation Tanner.
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.640]  To make it a permanent thing in my life now.
[42:22.920 --> 42:24.060]  And that's not real.
[42:25.140 --> 42:27.620]  I think that that's an insane tattoo to get.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.400]  And I wasn't sure how to feel about it.
[42:29.540 --> 42:32.240]  And then Emily showed me the thread and was like, do you see this?
[42:32.260 --> 42:32.820]  And I was like, yeah.
[42:32.840 --> 42:35.320]  And she goes, these kids, they like to have fun.
[42:35.540 --> 42:36.240]  They're good kids.
[42:36.300 --> 42:38.080]  And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess so.
[42:38.120 --> 42:38.700]  That's a good point.
[42:38.900 --> 42:39.900]  She's like, I like them.
[42:39.960 --> 42:40.560]  They're up to good.
[42:40.600 --> 42:41.320]  They're having fun.
[42:41.360 --> 42:42.900]  And I was like, that's a great point.
[42:43.040 --> 42:44.340]  They're having a hell of a good time.
[42:44.820 --> 42:46.920]  I let a friend give me a stick and poke tattoo.
[42:46.920 --> 42:49.420]  Like, dude, that's cool.
[42:49.600 --> 42:49.960]  Why not?
[42:50.140 --> 42:52.380]  I have Gavin's nose on my fucking shin for Christ's sake.
[42:52.780 --> 42:52.980]  Exactly.
[42:53.360 --> 42:56.160]  So what's, you know, I see this stuff and I just go, fuck it.
[42:56.300 --> 42:56.820]  Go for it.
[42:56.900 --> 42:58.260]  Regulation Tanner on your ass.
[42:58.560 --> 42:59.560]  Life's so big.
[42:59.760 --> 43:01.380]  It's so big, I'm sewing his arms.
[43:01.700 --> 43:03.840]  It's huge and it's on his ass.
[43:04.400 --> 43:05.700]  Huge and on his ass.
[43:06.200 --> 43:07.680]  Axel Foley on the other side.
[43:08.080 --> 43:09.760]  Really hammering both cheeks together.
[43:10.260 --> 43:13.500]  And I'll be honest, the gap between the A and the T is pretty sizable.
[43:15.320 --> 43:17.960]  Yeah, there's some spacey issues for sure.
[43:18.020 --> 43:20.020]  Regulae Cheon Tanner.
[43:21.720 --> 43:24.340]  Well, if these guys have a fan in Emily, for sure.
[43:24.500 --> 43:25.820]  Yeah, I think they're awesome.
[43:25.860 --> 43:27.860]  I'm a big, I'm a big fan of insane people.
[43:27.960 --> 43:28.780]  So I think this is great.
[43:29.120 --> 43:29.360]  I think this is fantastic.
[43:29.360 --> 43:31.900]  You just can tell that guy's going to be fun if you bump into him.
[43:33.380 --> 43:34.140]  That's a dude.
[43:34.260 --> 43:36.520]  That's a dude who's getting up to some good stuff.
[43:38.220 --> 43:40.320]  I don't know if it's good stuff, but he's getting up to stuff.
[43:40.320 --> 43:44.380]  Yeah, you're not bored hanging out with him.
[43:47.640 --> 43:50.080]  Oh, Regulation Sitter would make more sense, I think.
[43:50.700 --> 43:54.360]  Well, oh, Tanner isn't a name.
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.320]  Oh, he's got a tan.
[43:56.600 --> 43:57.600]  Yeah, because he got a tan.
[43:57.680 --> 43:58.540]  He's the tan guy.
[43:58.560 --> 43:59.220]  I get it.
[43:59.260 --> 44:00.660]  It also wasn't a tan.
[44:01.280 --> 44:01.900]  It was a burn.
[44:02.260 --> 44:03.480]  It was a sunburn.
[44:03.740 --> 44:05.400]  Didn't you just say it was called Jarvis?
[44:05.900 --> 44:07.720]  Yeah, it's like Jake Jarvis something.
[44:07.860 --> 44:09.860]  I thought maybe his brother's name was Tanner.
[44:09.860 --> 44:14.380]  I didn't consider Tanner being a thing.
[44:14.940 --> 44:17.320]  Four pictures ago, you posted a picture of a tan.
[44:18.720 --> 44:19.180]  That's a sunburn.
[44:19.440 --> 44:20.860]  Would you call that a tan?
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.500]  Well, it's going to be more tan than the tape's off.
[44:24.280 --> 44:27.720]  Okay, I don't think I'd look at that and go, yeah, check out this guy's tan.
[44:28.640 --> 44:30.440]  Like, what are you talking about?
[44:31.780 --> 44:33.580]  Dude, look at how tan this guy is.
[44:35.460 --> 44:37.660]  His fucking bright red back.
[44:37.920 --> 44:39.440]  Look at how tan he is, dude.
[44:42.820 --> 44:44.240]  What a legend.
[44:45.340 --> 44:46.080]  Gross, Gavin.
[44:46.880 --> 44:47.440]  Sorry.
[44:48.060 --> 44:48.480]  That's all right.
[44:49.480 --> 44:50.700]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[44:51.060 --> 44:54.940]  How long do you think the fax machine will still exist?
[44:55.680 --> 44:56.600]  Forever, right?
[44:56.780 --> 44:58.600]  Like, it's never gonna go away.
[44:58.980 --> 45:04.180]  And I feel like it's still used in the places that should be using it the least.
[45:04.560 --> 45:07.000]  It's being used by, like, hospitals and stuff.
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.580]  Like, doctors send faxes to offices and financial shit.
[45:13.020 --> 45:16.640]  At what point did the email get invented and a bunch of industries just went,
[45:17.220 --> 45:18.700]  no, not for me.
[45:19.140 --> 45:22.680]  I ran into a need for a fax last week for some personal financial stuff.
[45:22.740 --> 45:27.440]  And I was just thinking, I just caught myself thinking, like, still, like 2024.
[45:28.960 --> 45:31.440]  And there's no indication that it's going away.
[45:31.660 --> 45:34.380]  Like, do you remember when analog TV went away and they were like,
[45:34.380 --> 45:37.100]  for like a year and a half, they were, you were always seeing...
[45:37.820 --> 45:39.020]  Yeah, prepping the world for it.
[45:39.480 --> 45:40.180]  Notices everywhere.
[45:40.300 --> 45:41.280]  Yeah, like, hey, be ready.
[45:41.400 --> 45:42.920]  We're turning the signals off, turning the signals off.
[45:43.740 --> 45:45.920]  Nobody's going like, hey, just everybody be aware.
[45:46.100 --> 45:49.720]  10-year countdown, five-year countdown until we're done with fax machines,
[45:49.840 --> 45:53.060]  which tells me they're going to be around for fucking ever.
[45:53.500 --> 45:57.620]  How did, how do we escape the virus that is the fax?
[45:58.040 --> 45:58.660]  We don't.
[45:59.160 --> 46:02.660]  Do they still make, like, I assume companies still make their
[46:03.320 --> 46:06.840]  most recent fax machine, but are they innovating on the fax machine still?
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  Like, is there a 2024 fax machine?
[46:09.420 --> 46:11.580]  You know, I wonder that about printers, too,
[46:11.720 --> 46:14.620]  because my printer broke a while back at the old house,
[46:14.640 --> 46:16.260]  and I went and bought a new one,
[46:16.620 --> 46:21.300]  and I realized I bought the exact same model printer, but four years apart.
[46:21.440 --> 46:23.500]  And I thought, oh, they're not making new printers anymore.
[46:23.740 --> 46:25.600]  We probably hit peak printer technology.
[46:25.800 --> 46:28.640]  And now it's just like, you know, you get a new colorway every once in a while.
[46:29.020 --> 46:31.320]  I mean, as someone who's printing never freaking works,
[46:31.320 --> 46:33.240]  maybe they should keep innovating.
[46:33.500 --> 46:35.200]  Yeah, I agree.
[46:36.080 --> 46:36.720]  That's a good question.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.840]  Are there new fax technologies?
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.700]  Are scientists still innovating?
[46:42.700 --> 46:46.820]  Because there's always like, like, HDMI gets an update every few years.
[46:46.900 --> 46:49.700]  They'll be like, oh, it's HDMI 2.1 now.
[46:50.100 --> 46:51.740]  Is there, has there ever been fax 2?
[46:52.480 --> 46:54.640]  Wait, Jeff, what did you, what did you just search?
[46:55.020 --> 46:56.080]  Did scientists what?
[46:56.700 --> 46:59.460]  Are scientists still innovating the fax machine?
[47:02.660 --> 47:05.260]  I thought that would be a funny way to search it.
[47:05.500 --> 47:06.840]  Oh, you nailed it, bud.
[47:07.240 --> 47:08.340]  I know it's not scientists.
[47:08.640 --> 47:09.580]  It's fucking great.
[47:10.340 --> 47:11.160]  I'm a scientist.
[47:11.400 --> 47:12.420]  Oh, what kind of science do you do?
[47:12.640 --> 47:13.000]  Fax.
[47:16.420 --> 47:18.220]  Mimeograph and fax related science.
[47:19.220 --> 47:21.600]  The fuck? This guy's doing like 1980s science.
[47:21.720 --> 47:22.480]  What the shit?
[47:22.700 --> 47:27.200]  Just like the idea of them pulling scientists off other stuff to go back to the fax machine.
[47:27.960 --> 47:29.760]  You guys remember that movie Weird Science?
[47:29.940 --> 47:30.680]  Yeah, stuff like that.
[47:30.680 --> 47:32.120]  But with a fax machine, yeah.
[47:32.540 --> 47:33.500]  PhD and copy.
[47:34.060 --> 47:35.440]  Oh, goddamn.
[47:36.100 --> 47:39.380]  Is there fax 2?
[47:40.220 --> 47:43.080]  I was thinking about this with foods in general.
[47:43.700 --> 47:47.760]  It's crazy that there isn't just like an apple 2 or like rice 2.
[47:48.660 --> 47:51.820]  There isn't a brand that is just saying this is the sequel to this.
[47:52.660 --> 47:53.720]  Toast 2.
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.580]  We had a sequels thing once, didn't we?
[47:57.300 --> 47:58.200]  Best sequels.
[47:58.520 --> 47:59.420]  Best sequels, yeah.
[48:00.220 --> 48:01.360]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[48:01.400 --> 48:02.460]  The best sequels one was that.
[48:02.520 --> 48:03.620]  That was a really good one.
[48:03.840 --> 48:05.760]  We had the clapper in there, I think.
[48:05.840 --> 48:07.560]  It's a sequel to the light switch.
[48:10.720 --> 48:12.560]  That was before we were even doing drafts.
[48:12.580 --> 48:14.960]  I think that was just a topic that we had on the show.
[48:15.020 --> 48:16.520]  I don't remember that being a draft.
[48:16.620 --> 48:17.440]  That'd be a good draft.
[48:17.740 --> 48:18.560]  That would be a good draft.
[48:19.340 --> 48:23.000]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[48:23.340 --> 48:26.220]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[48:26.220 --> 48:29.920]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[48:30.300 --> 48:31.820]  Available for a limited time.
[48:32.020 --> 48:34.100]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[48:35.100 --> 48:37.820]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[48:38.180 --> 48:41.480]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.700]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[48:43.920 --> 48:47.140]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.600]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[48:51.820 --> 48:55.300]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[48:55.300 --> 48:57.580]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[49:00.530 --> 49:03.310]  Oh, I wanted, yeah, I wanted to, I have one on my list actually.
[49:03.390 --> 49:07.050]  This is different because that could be anything, but I wanted to do best third movie.
[49:09.090 --> 49:10.450]  Oh, historically awful.
[49:10.830 --> 49:13.670]  Yeah, historically awful films, but there's got to be a few that are good.
[49:13.990 --> 49:15.870]  You know, there's gotta, there's gotta be some.
[49:15.990 --> 49:17.070]  Godfather 3 sucks.
[49:17.170 --> 49:18.250]  Matrix 3 sucks.
[49:18.950 --> 49:20.150]  Die Hard 3 is great.
[49:20.290 --> 49:21.210]  Die Hard 3 is great.
[49:22.090 --> 49:22.910]  Is it great?
[49:23.210 --> 49:25.450]  Yeah, I mean, it's better than, it's better than 2.
[49:25.450 --> 49:26.970]  Better than 2, not better than 1 though.
[49:27.050 --> 49:28.930]  It's long, but it's good.
[49:29.690 --> 49:33.270]  It's probably the second best in the franchise.
[49:33.830 --> 49:36.090]  The third Quiet Place movie, I think, is the best.
[49:36.470 --> 49:37.690]  Third Mission Impossible is awesome.
[49:38.130 --> 49:41.330]  That's the one I was about to ask about was, what was the third Mission Impossible?
[49:41.610 --> 49:43.190]  That's the one I lost my car in.
[49:43.190 --> 49:44.070]  Yeah, the rabbit's foot.
[49:47.110 --> 49:49.210]  Yeah, best threes would be an interesting draft.
[49:49.530 --> 49:51.750]  Yeah, that's a really good one because none of them are tough.
[49:51.750 --> 49:52.470]  Best third thing.
[49:53.450 --> 49:53.610]  Yeah.
[49:53.890 --> 49:55.330]  Dude, dude, Terminator 3.
[49:55.450 --> 49:56.090]  Hell yeah.
[49:58.230 --> 49:58.630]  What?
[50:05.340 --> 50:06.140]  Windows 3.
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.280]  That's good, we're noting it.
[50:07.400 --> 50:08.620]  I think that's a good one.
[50:09.060 --> 50:11.560]  All right, well, we'll do that in the undefined future at some point.
[50:13.020 --> 50:19.420]  I was thinking the other day that my dog Albert, you know, the dog whose name you're
[50:19.420 --> 50:22.980]  all allowed to know now, a little English Bulldog, he's nine months old.
[50:23.420 --> 50:26.680]  We got him from a breeder in Dallas and then we brought him to Austin.
[50:26.680 --> 50:33.140]  And it struck me over the weekend that Albert has never seen a body of water before.
[50:33.660 --> 50:38.200]  Like, we got him a little splash pad to play around in the backyard and he loves it.
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.240]  But he's a little tepid about getting in it, you know?
[50:41.500 --> 50:46.140]  And I was thinking, God, I wonder how, if he would recognize it as water, like,
[50:46.220 --> 50:47.420]  would it faze him at all?
[50:47.500 --> 50:48.380]  Would he pay any attention to it?
[50:48.380 --> 50:53.820]  So I took him over the weekend down to Town Lake, to like the hike and bike trail, and
[50:53.820 --> 50:56.600]  I walked him over to the edge to see what would happen.
[50:57.260 --> 50:58.140]  And Emily and I did.
[50:58.380 --> 50:59.000]  And we walked him.
[50:59.120 --> 51:01.880]  It was kind of like, to get close to the water over there, you kind of got to go down like
[51:01.880 --> 51:04.000]  a little muddy, you know, embankment a little bit.
[51:04.040 --> 51:06.800]  And he was super interested in like smelling the mud.
[51:07.040 --> 51:10.620]  And he kind of like walked down, just kind of smelling the mud and like looking at the
[51:10.620 --> 51:11.100]  dirt and shit.
[51:11.180 --> 51:15.560]  And then he looked up and he saw the water and he jumped his height.
[51:16.160 --> 51:16.880]  He jumped.
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.980]  He jumped a foot in the air.
[51:19.980 --> 51:25.760]  I've never seen a dog so surprised and so shocked in their life.
[51:26.120 --> 51:30.400]  It scared the absolute utter shit out of him.
[51:30.560 --> 51:31.940]  And that was all he needed.
[51:32.040 --> 51:34.140]  He turned around and was like, I'm good.
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.280]  And then, I shit you not, unfortunately, about eight seconds later, Emily went, oh,
[51:39.340 --> 51:39.660]  no.
[51:39.880 --> 51:40.500]  And I went, what?
[51:40.560 --> 51:47.120]  And I looked up to see a fucking snake slithering past us, 18, 20 feet in front of us.
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.860]  So I jumped on my height, about 10 feet in the air, and then we got the fuck out of
[51:51.860 --> 51:52.000]  there.
[51:52.300 --> 51:57.520]  But if I just if your animal has never seen a body of water before, just take it.
[51:57.660 --> 52:01.460]  It might it's wild how they might react to it.
[52:01.500 --> 52:02.980]  You never wash them in the tub?
[52:03.960 --> 52:08.000]  No, I wash them in the backyard with no, we've washed them in the tub before.
[52:08.200 --> 52:09.400]  But you don't fill the water up.
[52:09.460 --> 52:13.000]  We have like a little hose, you know, and it's like, yeah, it's getting wet.
[52:13.160 --> 52:15.780]  But yeah, and he gets he gets washed at the groomers.
[52:15.780 --> 52:18.560]  But it's not he's never submerged.
[52:19.600 --> 52:20.720]  What an exciting day.
[52:21.560 --> 52:22.160]  For the dogs.
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.560]  I wish I could remember the first time I went to like the beach.
[52:25.800 --> 52:27.600]  Saw like a large body of water.
[52:29.020 --> 52:30.020]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[52:30.020 --> 52:32.620]  Trying to process like, yeah, I have zero memory of that.
[52:33.160 --> 52:34.420]  I mean, you grew up around water.
[52:34.580 --> 52:35.720]  Yeah, it was probably pretty early.
[52:35.820 --> 52:36.420]  I did, too.
[52:37.240 --> 52:39.040]  Gavin, do you remember first time you saw an ocean?
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.140]  No, I think I was too young.
[52:41.720 --> 52:45.300]  Yeah, Eric, I'm assuming you were pretty, pretty.
[52:45.300 --> 52:46.260]  I mean, we would just go.
[52:46.600 --> 52:50.640]  Yeah, we were poor people in San Diego, so we just went to the bay.
[52:50.920 --> 52:52.600]  So I remember going to the bay when I was really young.
[52:53.260 --> 52:53.840]  Nick, how about you?
[52:54.880 --> 52:55.740]  I couldn't tell you.
[52:56.020 --> 52:58.820]  It's I probably from a young age, honestly.
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.020]  I was thinking about that the other day, about how many firsts we did don't matter.
[53:04.120 --> 53:05.140]  So you don't remember.
[53:05.520 --> 53:07.980]  Like, I don't remember the first hamburger I ever ate.
[53:08.780 --> 53:09.600]  Why would I, I guess?
[53:09.620 --> 53:13.940]  Yeah, I feel like parents should make a big, bigger deal about firsts of many.
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.940]  You do for like the first year, like we made a baby book.
[53:19.160 --> 53:21.100]  And it's like the first food you ever ate.
[53:21.180 --> 53:23.880]  And it's like it was green, strained carrots or whatever.
[53:24.280 --> 53:28.360]  You know, I think it was sweet potatoes, actually, for me, or yams.
[53:28.600 --> 53:31.840]  But it's all that developmental stuff.
[53:31.940 --> 53:37.680]  But you don't ever be like, I don't know, first pair of tennis shoes you ever wore
[53:37.680 --> 53:40.440]  or first time you rode a skateboard or, you know.
[53:41.580 --> 53:44.480]  First movie I saw, I remember just because it was a big deal to me.
[53:44.520 --> 53:45.420]  It was Fox and the Hound.
[53:45.920 --> 53:50.240]  And it was a twofer.
[53:50.360 --> 53:54.160]  It was Fox and the Hound and the Disney Robin Hood.
[53:54.540 --> 53:55.560]  So it was two foxes.
[53:55.820 --> 53:56.900]  It was Fox, Double Fox Day.
[53:57.160 --> 53:57.920]  Double Fox.
[53:59.160 --> 54:00.180]  Disney Robin Hood.
[54:00.900 --> 54:01.320]  Good movie.
[54:01.960 --> 54:02.660]  It was a good combination.
[54:03.160 --> 54:03.460]  Great movie.
[54:04.100 --> 54:05.980]  Were you taken aback, Gavin?
[54:06.640 --> 54:09.040]  And sorry to take it back to Beverly Hills Cop for a moment.
[54:09.040 --> 54:10.680]  When I was committing other crimes.
[54:10.820 --> 54:11.820]  Jesus Christ.
[54:12.460 --> 54:12.860]  When you what?
[54:13.060 --> 54:16.280]  When I was committing all the crimes, were you were you taken aback by that?
[54:16.340 --> 54:16.940]  I was shocked.
[54:17.700 --> 54:20.340]  When I was watching it, I went, gee, I did all this.
[54:20.680 --> 54:21.600]  These are all my crimes.
[54:22.060 --> 54:23.820]  Did it not register with you at all?
[54:24.380 --> 54:25.140]  You're watching the movie.
[54:26.160 --> 54:27.340]  I can't believe you didn't have the slot.
[54:27.640 --> 54:30.160]  Look at what the villains wear in the film.
[54:30.760 --> 54:32.120]  I just posted a screenshot.
[54:32.680 --> 54:40.000]  I just kept going like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[54:40.200 --> 54:41.680]  That's that's crazy.
[54:42.440 --> 54:45.120]  Sorry, regulation, Tanner's butt.
[54:45.300 --> 54:46.880]  It's going to that's going to be the thumbnail.
[54:47.340 --> 54:50.700]  Dude, that might be the first iteration of the mask.
[54:51.180 --> 54:52.880]  Like, that's crazy.
[54:53.460 --> 54:58.900]  They all are wearing like Rainbow Six Vegas faces, essentially, is and it's every one
[54:58.900 --> 54:59.680]  of them wears it.
[54:59.860 --> 55:00.360]  They're unified.
[55:00.360 --> 55:03.360]  We've got to rotoscope your one onto this movie.
[55:04.540 --> 55:05.660]  Oh, that'd be great.
[55:08.040 --> 55:11.800]  Not well, I don't even know what rotoscope means, so I'm definitely not it.
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.340]  I like it.
[55:13.780 --> 55:15.520]  This is your dock.
[55:15.760 --> 55:16.500]  Did you take this picture?
[55:17.420 --> 55:17.580]  Yeah.
[55:18.160 --> 55:23.220]  You've got stuff on your dock that you don't have installed.
[55:23.400 --> 55:24.500]  You've got two question marks.
[55:25.380 --> 55:26.560]  Yeah, I do.
[55:27.120 --> 55:28.080]  Oh, this is good.
[55:28.120 --> 55:29.360]  I'm going to start looking at this now.
[55:29.360 --> 55:31.040]  This is pretty exciting.
[55:31.280 --> 55:32.680]  Let's see what else he's got down here.
[55:32.820 --> 55:36.960]  The one next to photos is an app that's not functional on that operating system.
[55:37.160 --> 55:39.540]  And then he's got two just broken links.
[55:41.460 --> 55:44.800]  Every tiny little corner of your life is a shit show.
[55:45.900 --> 55:47.200]  Which one's photos?
[55:49.020 --> 55:50.560]  Oh, that's funny.
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.240]  Yeah, I don't know.
[55:52.380 --> 55:52.600]  Yeah.
[55:52.600 --> 55:53.420]  Microsoft Word.
[55:53.540 --> 55:54.380]  I don't have that anymore.
[55:54.380 --> 55:54.900]  Yeah.
[55:58.700 --> 56:00.540]  I don't even know what a lot of these are.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.080]  What's the what's the one that's next?
[56:03.280 --> 56:05.420]  It's like two down from Audacity to the right.
[56:05.600 --> 56:06.900]  It's next to like the App Store one.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.420]  It looks like a little like lectern.
[56:08.720 --> 56:09.480]  What is that?
[56:09.760 --> 56:10.480]  A lectern?
[56:10.680 --> 56:12.300]  Oh, is it like a keynote or something?
[56:12.660 --> 56:14.160]  All the way over to the right.
[56:14.660 --> 56:15.640]  What is that?
[56:17.340 --> 56:20.580]  The clean my Mac X between the G and the bench?
[56:21.040 --> 56:21.460]  The App Store?
[56:21.520 --> 56:22.160]  Yeah, I don't have.
[56:22.220 --> 56:23.400]  I'm trying to look at my bar.
[56:23.500 --> 56:24.040]  I don't have it.
[56:24.040 --> 56:25.120]  Yeah, I was.
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.120]  That was when I was just desperately trying to make this Mac run when I was just.
[56:29.600 --> 56:31.480]  So put more shits on it.
[56:32.820 --> 56:36.240]  Make sure it's on that bar so I can jump on it real quick.
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.100]  Did it work?
[56:37.160 --> 56:37.680]  I don't know.
[56:38.820 --> 56:39.880]  You got Plex.
[56:40.000 --> 56:40.800]  You got handbrake.
[56:40.840 --> 56:41.480]  This is fascinating.
[56:41.920 --> 56:42.900]  This is great.
[56:43.260 --> 56:44.400]  What do I do as a handbrake?
[56:44.440 --> 56:46.720]  What's the sunset in between the two question marks?
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.140]  What is that?
[56:47.240 --> 56:49.980]  That was a game called meditation.
[56:51.240 --> 56:52.500]  You were every day.
[56:52.620 --> 56:54.760]  You get a new little game from indie developers.
[56:55.820 --> 57:02.520]  Can I want to come over and just just slightly boost the efficiency of your day to day?
[57:02.700 --> 57:03.460]  Oh, please.
[57:04.260 --> 57:05.120]  I'd love that.
[57:06.360 --> 57:07.540]  But here's what's going to happen.
[57:07.620 --> 57:09.740]  I'm going to come in and be like, you don't need this, this, this and this.
[57:09.820 --> 57:11.220]  And you'll be like, well, what if I need it for this?
[57:11.380 --> 57:12.460]  Oh, I don't trust this.
[57:12.660 --> 57:13.060]  Blah, blah, blah.
[57:13.100 --> 57:16.580]  You're going to argue me back to this exact way out of your door.
[57:16.580 --> 57:17.020]  No, I won't.
[57:17.640 --> 57:19.180]  I don't know what any of these things do.
[57:19.180 --> 57:21.960]  You get rid of 90% of Gavin's.
[57:22.000 --> 57:22.660]  Well, I just don't.
[57:22.820 --> 57:23.500]  They don't bother me.
[57:23.540 --> 57:25.340]  And I don't know that getting rid of them helps.
[57:25.900 --> 57:27.380]  It doesn't help.
[57:27.500 --> 57:28.740]  It just yeah, yeah, that's true.
[57:28.900 --> 57:30.360]  It might it might hurt him.
[57:30.540 --> 57:31.560]  It might hurt him.
[57:31.760 --> 57:33.360]  It's not that I think it hurts or helps.
[57:33.460 --> 57:34.400]  I'm indifferent to it.
[57:34.700 --> 57:39.700]  The only way I know how to open Skype is to go 16 icons over from Safari.
[57:40.380 --> 57:42.200]  I don't ever click the icons.
[57:42.500 --> 57:43.920]  I only click Google.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.520]  Why do you have the bar?
[57:45.620 --> 57:46.420]  Why are they there?
[57:46.980 --> 57:48.620]  I didn't know I could get rid of the bar.
[57:48.620 --> 57:53.540]  Oh, this episode rocks.
[57:54.940 --> 57:58.280]  I love this episode so much.
[57:59.120 --> 58:01.540]  You don't know you can hide the bar.
[58:02.280 --> 58:05.740]  Also, look where the Apple logo is in relation to the dog.
[58:05.900 --> 58:08.340]  We're seeing like slightly more than half of it.
[58:08.380 --> 58:10.060]  There's so much that's off the screen.
[58:10.480 --> 58:11.480]  Do you want to see the full?
[58:11.780 --> 58:12.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[58:12.900 --> 58:13.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:13.380 --> 58:14.500]  I want to see the whole thing, dude.
[58:15.120 --> 58:15.640]  100%.
[58:15.640 --> 58:16.580]  This is mental.
[58:17.100 --> 58:20.940]  I don't know why we're surprised by it.
[58:21.040 --> 58:22.800]  It's like the shift key guy.
[58:23.100 --> 58:24.120]  Like, what did we expect?
[58:24.360 --> 58:25.220]  Like, of course.
[58:26.760 --> 58:29.440]  This is the best camera app on the store browser.
[58:30.760 --> 58:32.880]  Was that a Digi or a?
[58:33.040 --> 58:33.620]  No, this is.
[58:34.780 --> 58:36.100]  This is the soy.
[58:39.440 --> 58:39.660]  OK.
[58:41.880 --> 58:46.500]  Also, my screen is I need to clean my screen, but I'm also I just am not good at that.
[58:46.600 --> 58:47.020]  I don't know.
[58:47.160 --> 58:47.540]  Oh, yeah.
[58:48.140 --> 58:50.440]  I don't know how that because you always get the smears.
[58:50.640 --> 58:52.880]  I use the towel, but I still get the smears.
[58:53.520 --> 58:53.960]  OK.
[58:54.320 --> 58:55.400]  Oh, my God.
[58:56.620 --> 58:57.840]  Oh, what the?
[58:58.920 --> 59:00.640]  Oh, it just keeps going on the right.
[59:00.880 --> 59:01.480]  Oh, my God.
[59:01.580 --> 59:03.160]  What are those next to steam?
[59:03.260 --> 59:05.000]  What is what are like in the next?
[59:05.940 --> 59:08.280]  Andrew and I have the exact same Mac, I think.
[59:08.440 --> 59:09.540]  It's a quick time.
[59:10.920 --> 59:14.180]  I have a mine is from 2009, I believe.
[59:14.680 --> 59:16.260]  Oh, mine's from 2019.
[59:17.030 --> 59:20.380]  Are you doing a lot of stuff in garage band?
[59:22.140 --> 59:23.880]  I've never I never open it.
[59:23.940 --> 59:26.040]  I think I deleted all the instruments.
[59:26.360 --> 59:29.540]  This is this is the fucking empty the garage.
[59:29.900 --> 59:30.280]  You just go.
[59:30.880 --> 59:33.660]  And you have the onscreen keyboard up.
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.480]  Yeah, because I the brightness on my keyboard doesn't work.
[59:37.540 --> 59:39.460]  So I use that for the adjust the brightness.
[59:39.460 --> 59:40.540]  This is.
[59:44.580 --> 59:53.000]  You have a whole second keyboard open to adjust the brightness.
[59:53.860 --> 59:54.220]  Yeah.
[59:55.520 --> 01:00:01.500]  Because I have a Windows keyboard, an alienware that I've plugged in an old alienware keyboard.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.920]  And for some reason, the brightness doesn't work on the alienware one.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.340]  When I hit, it doesn't do anything.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.440]  Why don't you just map that to a different key?
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.540]  The open and close brackets.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.560]  He doesn't know that you can do that.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.220]  What you just told him he doesn't know you can do.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.600]  I'm impressed that you're finding ways around it, but it's.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.900]  See, that's the thing.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.880]  I will find a solution to my problem and it might not be the most efficient,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.980]  but if it works, I'm happy.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.360]  What happens when you're watching the movie?
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.800]  Is there just a keyboard on top of it?
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.320]  No, this is what I'll do, OK?
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.520]  I'll show you exactly what I do when I need to come over.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.400]  Oh, this is I love this.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.260]  I'm so happy.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.360]  I have like the biggest smile on my face for like the last five minutes.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.280]  I'm having a really easy fix.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.940]  This is super simple.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.500]  So if I want to watch something and I'm bothered by the fact that I have a keyboard,
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:02.440]  a thing that what I do is I just I just click and drag.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:07.060]  I just shrink and drag your shrink and drag that thing and bring it to the top, right?
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.400]  You slide it out of the way.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.500]  So where does it go there?
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.600]  Does it does it go into the the bar as an icon or it just stays there?
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.040]  It just stays on top of everything.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.900]  You have Catalina?
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.000]  You can't go above that.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300]  That's as high as I can go.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.300]  Yeah, that's probably as far as you go.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.840]  Well, I mean, that's better than what I was expecting, where I thought there was every
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.840]  possibility that you just put post-it notes over it, to be honest.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:38.780]  No.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.860]  No, I don't even.
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.640]  IMAC, it's just on top.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.340]  Late 2013?
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.880]  Yeah, it's listen, I'm old.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.300]  This is you want to know why everything shut down?
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.260]  I was printing the law.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:54.960]  Can we as a company expense get this man a computer made in the last decade?
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.720]  Listen, I got a laptop.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:56.920]  Yeah.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.200]  I mean, even a fresh reinstall of that would probably do you wonders.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.300]  Probably, yeah.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.780]  What do you mean a fresh reinstall?
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.360]  Just what do you mean?
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.040]  What does he mean?
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.520]  I don't know what you mean, but why would reinstalling help?
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.680]  Uh, it would just get rid of a bunch of junk and 10 years worth of shit you've downloaded.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.340]  You'd keep your files.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:20.780]  Uh.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.400]  But you might maybe not have those two apps that aren't fully there anymore.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:26.620]  He's not.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.040]  Do you have any other questions about the apps?
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.780]  Do you have any other questions about the apps?
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.140]  This copy of Cleo Max X has been deactivated.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.980]  Please contact your plan owner to get a new device spot or get up.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.120]  I don't I I'm the one I know why that's there.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.260]  Let's look at my.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:46.820]  We got it.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.060]  We got to start wrapping this up.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:48.900]  This is insane.
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:52.340]  This can I can I can you guys troubleshoot a problem for me really quickly?
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do it.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:54.220]  OK.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:02.320]  So this is this is a problem I have where I'm going to take a screenshot right now.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.840]  I so you know how you got the two faces on the bottom left that have one mouth.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.060]  The finder.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.640]  Yeah, the two faces.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.620]  The mouth thing.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.060]  Let me get rid of this Adobe Acrobat thing.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.760]  So you click that and then you get taken.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.820]  Take a photo of this.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.700]  This. Oh, geez.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:25.840]  What's that popping up?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.340]  The keyboard?
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.640]  No, it's something else popped up for a second.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.160]  The keyboard.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.600]  Keyboard's tucked away.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.500]  OK, so you take a photo.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.080]  I took a photo, so it pops up, right?
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.140]  And you have those things on the left that say iCloud drive.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.400]  Where are all of your?
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.800]  That's here's the thing.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.300]  They all went away one day and I don't know where they went and I don't know how to get them back.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.180]  Your favorites.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:02.900]  You have all your tags are the color coded default ones, but you've added one that's hashtag destiny.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.380]  And then you just have 100 screenshots.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.040]  I just figured it out.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]  I hid them.
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:15.420]  There's a hide.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.780]  Oh, you just clicked favorites and they all unleashed again.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.900]  Yeah, I just.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.620]  There you go.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.680]  Troubleshooting for you, man.
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.000]  So how have you been getting anywhere?
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.180]  OK, how do you get to like documents?
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.260]  This is how I get documents.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.180]  Why do you have a document called incidents?
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.760]  What the fuck is that about?
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.840]  Have you thought about jumping on this Apple music plan?
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.740]  That's I mean, what a steal right there.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.240]  Millions of songs all at me.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:53.660]  Wow.
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:54.600]  Try for free.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.760]  It's two.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.680]  It's the second incidents file.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.040]  Yeah, I'm looking.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:04:59.780]  I'm opening it.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.120]  It's loading.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.520]  I don't know what that is.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.440]  There's playlists for the gym, for a job, for work, yard.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.280]  When do you decide between job and work for your playlists?
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.380]  I don't know.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.160]  I haven't used iTunes in probably 10 years, at least.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.460]  I haven't used iTunes since 2014 was the last time I was an iTunes guy.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.320]  Why is it open?
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.300]  OK, I think I took.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.300]  Is this the right one?
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.160]  OK, so see, everything is now popped up because it was hidden.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.300]  That's where it was.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:32.960]  Deleted users.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.760]  How often are you going in there?
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:35.920]  I don't know.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.540]  I've deleted users.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.220]  Oh, that's my favorite folder, Gavin.
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.140]  My 90 year old granddad has an iMac from a similar time.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.720]  And it's in bad condition.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.000]  It's it's less messy.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.680]  Look at the name of that PDF.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.260]  What is going on?
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.460]  Quotes, comma, semicolon, dash.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.480]  What is that?
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.800]  How many podcasts has your grandfather recorded during that time?
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.200]  Andrew's putting it, putting it to work.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.680]  So when my dad...
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.220]  I like to send things to my desktop.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.020]  And but my desktop went away.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.040]  All the logos went away.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.620]  It was just the thing I said before.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.540]  I didn't know how to fix it.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.620]  So my solution to my problem...
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.660]  Please don't say this.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.120]  I made a folder on my desktop called desktop.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.040]  And I would just have everything go there.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.420]  And then I would open my desktop folder.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.400]  What do you mean?
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.240]  I have a desktop folder.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:38.560]  See?
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.180]  So wait, why wasn't...
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.840]  So stuff wasn't showing up on the desktop.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.620]  I didn't know how to reach the desktop like things.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.520]  It's behind all your junk.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:53.020]  I know, but there was a time in which there were 50,000 things on it.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.140]  And I've really cleaned it up.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.920]  Okay, so this, we got to save this.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.080]  So go to your desktop.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:58.900]  All right, great.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:06:59.920]  Now go to desktop.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:06.440]  Okay, so imagine, imagine you're in a cornfield, right?
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.580]  And then you add another cob of corn into the field.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.680]  It's not...
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.240]  You can't tell where the cob went.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:19.400]  So I needed to be able to see most recents because I just had 20,000 things on my desktop.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.980]  So once again, you put another thing on it.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:29.240]  All of your cleanup actions involve putting more shit into it.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.560]  Just tidy up.
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.020]  You've got it.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.880]  Also, you've got it next to episode 94 of F*** Face.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:40.200]  Why is that one on his own?
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.740]  Yeah, that was, that's a .AUP.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.360]  I would have accidentally saved that.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.820]  Yeah, I don't save project files.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.940]  Oh, man.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.400]  I say you get rid of that one, but you hang on to playing with grandpa.mov.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:01.000]  Be sure to keep commercial takes .AUP as well.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:02.640]  Can't imagine those.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.940]  I'm really worried about this.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.660]  View my spreadsheet.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.900]  What is this incidents?
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.920]  Yeah, why don't you list off a few of the incidents?
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.360]  It's it's loading a thing that I've never opened before.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.440]  Apparently it's a virus.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.500]  It's called numbers.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.420]  Yeah, that's a spreadsheet.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.680]  Yeah, it's a CSV file.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880]  Excel for Mac.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:23.560]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.480]  Okay, let's see.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.820]  Numbers iCloud.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.720]  It's loading.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.740]  I got the pinwheel.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.620]  Column one.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.940]  What woman piss?
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.800]  Date last June 19th, 2020 to 27 a.m.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.360]  Uh, what's opening?
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.540]  What is this?
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.100]  What do we got still opening?
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.240]  Sorry once again for the very visual segment.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.120]  Yeah, it also the stuff.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.040]  Also, we can't see this part.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.140]  Yeah, we're with you.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.140]  Oh, wait, everything's.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.300]  Why is everything going away?
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.840]  Oh, oh, no.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.040]  It's a it's just a checkerboard or maybe it hasn't loaded in yet.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:10.280]  It's just a white and gray.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.800]  Oh, it's a spreadsheet.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:13.480]  Yeah.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.600]  Oh, oh, this is like all of the crimes that occurred in the NIMO, I think.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.540]  What is it like a police incident report?
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.540]  Yeah, it's police incident reports and where they happened.
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.240]  Why?
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:35.500]  Uh, mischief under 5000, crime type mischief, crime type ID, too.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.620]  Do you also have a police scanner that you listen to at night?
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.120]  Uh, I used to.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:40.820]  I don't anymore.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.400]  I enjoy the police scanner.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.780]  Neighborhood downtown.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.480]  PCK is heading out.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.720]  Let's not make fun of that.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.880]  I still do that.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.160]  You listen to cops?
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.140]  Fuck yeah, I listen to police scanner all the time.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.960]  All the time, like every night.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.580]  I would say probably three times a week I listen to it.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:05.920]  I just think Andrew's going to be listening to it to to mask up and fight crime himself.
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:06.640]  Of course.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.320]  I mean, I'm sure he has a reason for it, but yeah.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.220]  With an ankle integrity up over 90, he's ready to get out there and fight crime.
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.020]  He could kick so much crime.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.460]  Oh, mischief under or over a thousand or 5000.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.020]  Loss of enjoyment of property.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.460]  Well.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.000]  Oh, man, I was enjoying that property so fucking much.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:36.040]  Well, you're more of a mystery to me now than you were about an hour ago.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.780]  So congratulations, Andrew.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.220]  I'm just happy I got my desktop back on the on the thing.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.760]  It used to get really annoyed where I'd have to open the desktop always.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.020]  I'd always have that folder open and I'd hide it.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.600]  And then when you click the two faces, it would pop up the first one.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.500]  So that one would pop up instead of.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.080]  So how would you get to documents if it was hidden?
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:10:59.700]  Uh.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.760]  What do you mean?
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.520]  Well, what doc?
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.480]  I don't think I use documents.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.120]  OK.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.980]  I don't think I have any documents that I'm looking for that.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.100]  I mean, incidents, I would say, could be a document.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.960]  You know what I did was I pivoted because Grammarly has an in-app document like writer.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.700]  And I just switched to that.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.740]  Oh, of course.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.080]  Yeah.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:25.160]  How do I look at it?
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.120]  So I just go to documents and I'm scrolling.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.300]  I got.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.880]  Winter Movie League 2015.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]  I haven't been in.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.640]  I haven't been in my docs all that often.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:42.820]  I don't think I know you at all.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.800]  And that's amazing.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.800]  You must.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.780]  You must find a problem and get around it.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.680]  And surely think, man, that's convoluted.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.480]  Like, surely that's a simple way.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.820]  And once that's the disconnect that you and I have is that I have a solution.
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.160]  If I have a solution that I know works, I can just live with it.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.960]  And if you want to show me a more efficient way, I'm totally open to it.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.280]  But I don't question it beyond.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.160]  That is why that is how the caps lock key happens.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.180]  Uh.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.040]  I have a way to capitalize my things.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.060]  I'm good.
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:23.940]  I move on.
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.120]  I never think about it again.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.380]  There's never a question of can I optimize this?
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.760]  You're like the fax machine of this podcast.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.480]  I am, yeah.
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.440]  Still going strong.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.520]  Still going strong.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.860]  No innovation needed.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.440]  Oh, man.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.220]  Speaking of no innovation needed, what another perfect podcast.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.360]  I can't believe it.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.860]  We knocked it out of the park again.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:48.720]  Just like this.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:51.960]  Out of the park.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.760]  Thanks for listening to episode 17 of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.620]  If you want to, I don't know, support us in some way.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.240]  Gavin, you could probably tell them how to do that.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.140]  Go for it.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:07.840]  Well, we've got Regulatrion.com, which takes you straight to our Patreon.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:15.960]  However, it's better if you don't use an iOS device because we get supported slightly less
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.940]  if you do that.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:17.600]  Is that right, Eric?
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.420]  No, we get supported the same, it costs you more.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.500]  It will cost you more.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.820]  Oh, they just bump the price?
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.720]  In November, yeah.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.620]  So we got this notice today, just so you guys are aware, at the time of this recording.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:37.240]  In November, Patreon on iOS devices is having to use Apple's billing system.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:44.540]  And because of that, they are charging more for a subscription through the Patreon app.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:51.220]  So, if you want to subscribe to our Patreon, we recommend you go in a browser to Patreon.com
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.820]  slash the regulation pod.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.900]  And you can go subscribe to us directly there instead of using that app to do it, just so
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.280]  you're not having to pay a surcharge.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.840]  We're trying to save you the money.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.900]  That's just, that's how all this stuff is shaking out right now.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.840]  Again, we found out about it a couple hours ago.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.340]  Save yourself some money.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.600]  I remember signing up for YouTube Premium, or YouTube Red, I think it was called at the
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:11.840]  time.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.800]  And even like the monthly charge is more expensive.
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.760]  If you just sign up one time on a phone, it's insane that the app will take a bigger cut
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.660]  than Patreon do.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:22.340]  They do.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.160]  They take, it's a large cut.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.580]  You're just giving free money to Big Apple if you do it.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:26.760]  Yeah.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:31.660]  So instead, give that money to us or keep it in your own pocket by going to Patreon.com
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.000]  slash the regulation pod and subscribing directly to the show.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.320]  So you get stuff all the time, depending on the tier.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:42.540]  We're kind of evening it out so that way you can see easily, oh, I'm a falcon.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.200]  And then you click and you'd be like, oh, here's all the falcon stuff and everything
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:45.700]  that I get.
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.960]  And we're just cleaning all that up on Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.600]  But you can go there and subscribe right now.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.180]  And thank you very much for supporting us.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.700]  And if you don't want to subscribe, that's okay.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.360]  You can just listen to the podcast like a normal person.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.220]  There's nothing wrong with that either.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:02.960]  Speaking of listening to podcasts, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Gavin and
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.000]  I recently went and recorded a very special episode of the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.840]  If you're not familiar, it is a podcast that my wife and Eric's wife run with their friend
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.240]  Vanessa where they read and talk about smut.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.500]  And in one of their recent episodes, I'm not sure when it comes out or if it's already
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.120]  out as of this recording.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:23.880]  It's out.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.160]  Okay.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480]  There is an episode.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:31.000]  It's probably called Celestial Glorbosis because that is the name of the smut that Gavin and
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:31.400]  I wrote.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.000]  And if you want to hear them discuss it and read select excerpts from it, and then Gavin
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.520]  and I defend it to them while they interview us and ask us questions about it, you can
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.700]  hear it over on the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.700]  I imagine we'll probably find some way to release it to you, the audience.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.700]  I know we've talked in the past about having somebody read it.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.860]  I don't think we've settled on anything yet, but if you don't want to wait and you're itching
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.180]  to hear it now, please go listen to it over there.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:05.320]  It made me... I felt ill for about two hours after we finished recording.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.760]  That is not an understatement.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:15.220]  It was the weirdest thing to be in a room with four other people that I like dearly
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:20.600]  and have us all feel uncomfortable and unhappy being in the room for a little bit.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.320]  It was really wild.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:27.300]  I was embarrassed laughing for so long I got heartburn for about four hours.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:32.220]  Yeah, I got a little dizzy from... because we're trying to keep our laughter to a minimum
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.180]  because they're recording a podcast.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.220]  And I was laughing for so long at some point I saw stars for a second.
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.440]  But yeah, I think it's a pretty awesome story if I do say so myself.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.860]  The link to Clutch My Pearls is in the description, so go check it out.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.100]  And thanks for listening to this podcast.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.140]  We'll see you next time.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.040]  Bye.
[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:54.700]  Bye.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.280]  Eric dot sucks.
