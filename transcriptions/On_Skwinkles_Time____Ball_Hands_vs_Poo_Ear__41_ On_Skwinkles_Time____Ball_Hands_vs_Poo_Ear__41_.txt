[00:29.900 --> 00:34.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 41.
[00:34.380 --> 00:39.040]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Eric Baddour, Nick Schwartz, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton.
[00:39.280 --> 00:45.160]  We all have new nicknames, and we are sitting on our nicknames because we can't use them
[00:45.160 --> 00:49.380]  until the nickname draft comes out. But I'm dying to say everybody's new names
[00:49.380 --> 00:52.980]  at the start of the episode. That'll be next week, by the way. The 23rd
[00:52.980 --> 00:55.600]  is when the nickname draft comes out, by the way. Thank you.
[00:56.280 --> 00:59.720]  Jeff and myself and Andrew are all using our nicknames in Slack, though.
[01:00.080 --> 01:01.000]  Yeah, we are. We sure are.
[01:01.720 --> 01:03.540]  Partially so I don't forget what mine is.
[01:05.880 --> 01:08.740]  Yours is unforgettable, man. I think yours is great.
[01:09.140 --> 01:11.660]  Yours so describes you, too. I feel so good about it.
[01:11.660 --> 01:15.140]  Sure does. Yeah, no, it's good. I'm not, you know, not revealing anything. But yeah,
[01:15.320 --> 01:20.260]  excited for nicknames. I'm excited for that draft to come out and for the audience to
[01:20.260 --> 01:26.740]  see the process and see where we arrived and what nicknames almost made it but didn't quite get
[01:26.740 --> 01:30.660]  there. Yeah, there were some good ones. Eric particularly had a bunch of really good ones.
[01:30.900 --> 01:36.040]  No, I don't know why you and Emily are pushing that one so hard. Like, yeah, right. How come
[01:36.040 --> 01:40.620]  you didn't like that? It's like the worst one on the whole board. Like what? Like you're insane.
[01:41.040 --> 01:44.180]  Well, it's, you know, nicknames often the opposite of a person, you know, like tiny
[01:44.620 --> 01:48.180]  for a big guy. Hey, did I have homework for this episode?
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.260]  We were going to get into the mind table again because you left us so flummoxed last time.
[01:53.300 --> 01:57.680]  I don't remember what we're going to get into, though. Does anyone remember the specifics?
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.000]  Is this like, are you baiting us somewhere? No, I just because Eric said we should start
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.760]  with the thing. And I was curious if you guys remembered what the thing was, because I remember
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.000]  being like, oh, we'll continue this next time. But I was real heated and on edge at that time.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.860]  But I don't remember what the edge was that I was on. The last specific homework I remember is we
[02:21.860 --> 02:25.720]  were supposed to come up with seven deadly fruit sins. Got them. But I don't think we ever did.
[02:25.800 --> 02:30.020]  I think Andrew and I did and nobody else did. But I do vaguely remember what Eric's saying about
[02:30.020 --> 02:34.780]  about leading with the mind table and you clearing stuff up. I just can't remember how that. Yeah,
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.880]  I was going to do something. I think I think you were just going to clear things up because the
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.960]  drawings that you gave us were the worst drawings in history. So we made you redo the first one
[02:42.960 --> 02:46.240]  and the second one was somehow worse. Yeah, I think you were complaining that you didn't
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.700]  have enough time to properly do the mind table. Right. I think so. I think that's right. You've
[02:50.700 --> 02:56.100]  had it. Now you've had a week. I have. But on Squinkles time, that means I'm only halfway to
[02:56.100 --> 03:05.200]  what I need to actually get it done. So I got plenty of schedule laid on out there. Dude, that
[03:05.200 --> 03:13.720]  was pretty good. Did Squinkles just become a unit of time? I think Squinkles is a two week
[03:13.720 --> 03:20.360]  time period. Is Squinkling like you procrastinate constantly and you just never deliver? I don't
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.020]  think procrastinate is the right word. I did the wrong homework. I was so wrapped up because I
[03:26.020 --> 03:29.980]  brought up before we recorded the last episode, isn't there homework we're supposed to do?
[03:30.300 --> 03:34.340]  And then we were all like, I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't remember.
[03:34.340 --> 03:39.960]  And then at the end of last episode, Jeff said, oh, there's homework we're supposed to do.
[03:40.040 --> 03:43.180]  And then I panicked because I thought, oh, fuck, you're right. There was. What was it?
[03:43.300 --> 03:49.040]  I didn't do it. Shit. What was it? So then I prepared this episode for that homework.
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.500]  But now that we're here, I think there was other homework I was supposed to do
[03:52.500 --> 03:58.460]  from the previous episode. So I'm clearing up two episodes worth of homework or two episodes
[03:58.460 --> 04:02.800]  ago's homework. But I think I still have homework from last episode. All right. Hit us with it.
[04:03.500 --> 04:06.980]  I'm the only one fruit sins, apparently. I thought Jeff would have it because he did drop.
[04:07.160 --> 04:10.420]  I have my seven deadly fruit sins. Yeah. You have your fruit sins.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.860]  He already said he had his fruit sins. Shall we go through our fruit sin? Well,
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.180]  first, did you do a fruit demon? Well, I'm not an artist. Well,
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.980]  that has never stopped us before. I designed the idea of the fruit demon.
[04:26.280 --> 04:32.240]  I feel like that's enough. I drew up a fruit demon. I have my fruit demon.
[04:32.800 --> 04:39.960]  My fruit sins. We're going to put in my fruit demon, and then I'm going to post a minute.
[04:40.040 --> 04:46.320]  Do you guys see the insanely good fan art fruit demon? I mean, there's been some great fruit
[04:46.320 --> 04:53.200]  demons, but the one that looked like it was from like a devil, like a book, like a satanist novel.
[04:53.440 --> 05:00.700]  I want to see a satanist novel. Please let me. I saw the best one I've seen so far is the one
[05:00.700 --> 05:06.120]  who had bananas as horns, which is the funniest idea on earth to me. I'm going to post it.
[05:06.520 --> 05:12.520]  Let me find out who wrote it or who made this, because it's fantastic art.
[05:13.220 --> 05:19.620]  While you're doing that, am I crazy or did I see a screenshot of an X or Twitter,
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.880]  whatever the fuck you call it, where Granny Smith Apples shouted out the fruit demon?
[05:24.640 --> 05:28.780]  Did anybody else see that? No. I should have saved it when I saw it. It was in a thread somewhere.
[05:28.780 --> 05:31.540]  Wait, you saw Granny Smith shout out the fruit demon?
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.900]  That's not a real account. It's just somebody made it. It has like two followers, I think.
[05:38.020 --> 05:42.120]  Ah, see, so he knew it. I didn't know it. I just, I think I've seen that Granny Smith
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.180]  account before. An apple a day keeps the scurvy demon away. Someone made that in our community.
[05:48.680 --> 05:54.500]  He's got like a fruit kebab tail. Got the nose scrumping on the ground. It's like one of those
[05:54.500 --> 06:00.900]  line cut or like woodcut drawings. Yeah, that's great. I was so impressed by that. I looked at
[06:00.900 --> 06:05.540]  that and I went like, oh, that's funny. Somebody pulled something like someone had a reference
[06:05.540 --> 06:10.180]  point to that and then realizing, no, someone just drew that. That's really impressive.
[06:11.840 --> 06:14.980]  That's the one with the... Oh, and Eric just shared one by someone named Lindor.
[06:15.200 --> 06:19.960]  Yeah, this one was so... I love his stupid little cat face. He's got his funny little teeth,
[06:19.960 --> 06:26.620]  but he's got the like the regulation asterisk on his forehead. But then he also has Jeff's banana
[06:27.240 --> 06:30.740]  with the strawberry on the end in his hand. I think it's so good.
[06:31.340 --> 06:36.280]  Little red rocket fruit. I believe the one I posted was from someone named Tristan T. Zaris.
[06:36.960 --> 06:41.960]  These are great. Let me show you my fruit demon. I thought we'd all have fruit demons,
[06:42.020 --> 06:46.200]  but that's OK. I'll show up with mine. I can quickly find my fruit demon. Yeah,
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.560]  figure out your fruit demon. I'll post mine. My fruit demon. His name is vitamin D for death
[06:51.560 --> 07:01.120]  and demon. Here we go. This is my fruit demon. So it is for people that are just listening.
[07:01.680 --> 07:09.760]  He has strawberry legs and the stems go up into a body of like a coconut. And then he's got orange
[07:09.760 --> 07:14.860]  slices for hands. And it's very drippy. He drips everywhere. Everywhere he goes, he's leaving a
[07:14.860 --> 07:20.740]  little juice. Then he's got a banana head and two cherry eyes and really difficult to do something
[07:20.740 --> 07:27.080]  small. But it was supposed to be like a grapefruit mouth. And he's going to get you. So now that's a
[07:27.080 --> 07:31.020]  what kind of body is that again? It looks like a pear, but you said it was pear, coconut,
[07:31.080 --> 07:36.680]  whatever you want. You said any greenish kind of fruit thing. I honestly don't remember what I was
[07:36.680 --> 07:41.760]  initially going for, but it doesn't look like whatever it was. So whatever you interpret it as
[07:41.760 --> 07:48.740]  is the correct answer for the body. I really like how the cherry stems are also the eyebrows. I
[07:48.740 --> 07:53.580]  thought that I think that's very clever. Creative vision. You could tell it looks like somebody has
[07:53.580 --> 08:00.220]  spilled a thing of Welch's juice and you know he's there. You know, he killed somebody. Scene of the
[08:00.220 --> 08:06.880]  crime. A citrus death. You're like, the floor is sticky. He's been here. You hear the...
[08:06.880 --> 08:09.620]  blub blub blub blub. He walks around.
[08:11.820 --> 08:17.200]  And what do you do to summon him? It could be any of these sins. I have my sins. I'll read mine and
[08:17.200 --> 08:20.620]  then Jeff, do you want to read yours? Yeah, sure. Let's see if you have any crossover. I'm sure you
[08:20.620 --> 08:29.460]  do. The first sin. Poison. Mixing alcohol in the juice. It's a juice sin. Okay. Number two. Excess.
[08:30.140 --> 08:38.600]  Blending too many fruits at once. Too large of a variety. Don't like it. Number three. Negligence.
[08:39.420 --> 08:46.140]  Letting your fruit ripen and then rot and just not using it at all. Number four. Ignorance.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.820]  Ignoring lemonade stands. You have to use them. You have to utilize. What are you doing? It's
[08:52.820 --> 09:03.980]  ignorance. Yeah. Yeah. Being ignorant. Go to that stand. Squander. Not composting. You gotta reuse
[09:03.980 --> 09:10.580]  the fruit to make more fruit. It's a cycle. If you're not allowed to let your fruit rot because
[09:10.580 --> 09:17.060]  it's a sin, how are you ever gonna... You eat the apple and there's a core, you fuck. There's
[09:17.060 --> 09:23.360]  leftover fruit sometimes and fruit. You don't eat all of the fruit always. There's a peel.
[09:23.800 --> 09:32.080]  You dunce. Next question. Not a question. It's a sin. Erasure. You can edit out my flub, Nick.
[09:32.960 --> 09:42.080]  Removing any fruit trees. And lastly, but not least, the file. To peel without taste. Peeling
[09:42.080 --> 09:47.860]  a fruit and then just leaving it out. Not eating it. Wasting it. And those are the seven sins.
[09:48.140 --> 09:56.640]  Poison, excess, negligence, ignorance, squander, erasure, and defile. That's wild, dude. We didn't
[09:56.640 --> 10:04.900]  cross over at all. Hell yeah. We had slightly different takes. You went with the more, I guess,
[10:04.900 --> 10:13.000]  religious interpretation with the single sin word. I went for just actions that don't have a catchy
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.480]  phrase. But here are my seven deadly fruit sins. The first deadly fruit sin. Not washing a fruit
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.480]  before you eat it. You gotta wash it. It's got dirt on it. It's got pesticides on it. That's
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.740]  so good. Wash your fucking fruit. The second deadly sin. You'd think it'd be the first,
[10:27.800 --> 10:32.160]  but it's not because I didn't write it down. For scrumping. Don't steal. We don't scrump fruit.
[10:33.880 --> 10:41.420]  Third deadly sin. Eating unripe fruit. It's not ready for you, green banana. You're stealing
[10:41.420 --> 10:47.200]  its thunder away. Think about it this way. Fruit only gets one shot at being ripe.
[10:48.760 --> 10:54.300]  Don't take it away from the fruit. Number four. And I've seen this done a lot. I don't like it.
[10:54.360 --> 11:00.180]  It creeps me out. It's unnecessary. It's stupid. And it kind of goes with number five. Don't
[11:00.180 --> 11:05.020]  peel a grape. You don't peel grapes before you eat them. That's ridiculous. It makes like little
[11:05.020 --> 11:11.960]  brainy eyeballs. Nobody wants to eat that. Number five. Do peel a banana. That's right. It is a
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.780]  deadly sin to eat a banana without peeling it first. You will not enjoy bananas that way,
[11:16.940 --> 11:22.920]  so don't do it. Number six. If everybody doesn't know this, you should. Citrus does not go in the
[11:22.920 --> 11:30.080]  fridge. Leave it out. Oh, interesting. Citrus gotta stay out. Leave it on the counter. Don't
[11:30.080 --> 11:37.840]  eat it. Number seven. The seventh deadliest sin. Cranberry is only a garnish. Do not eat it as a
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.860]  main course. Yeah, no, definitely. I definitely agree with that. A hundred percent. Yeah, those
[11:42.860 --> 11:46.080]  are great, Jeff. There you go. Those are my seven deadly fruits. That was fantastic. Okay, now,
[11:46.200 --> 11:53.340]  Gavin, it's your turn. Your sins? Well, I was finding it weird that the sin about storing
[11:53.340 --> 11:58.660]  citrus in the fridge is a valid sin. I agree with it. But the juice from all the citrus has to go in
[11:58.660 --> 12:03.560]  the fridge. That is true. Yeah, but we're not doing... these aren't juice sins. No, these are
[12:03.560 --> 12:08.200]  fruit sins. I don't have any fruit sins. Do you want to see my fruit demon? Yes. I would love to
[12:08.200 --> 12:18.320]  see a fruit demon. Bam. It's a screenshot of a sledgehammer. That's Pierre Gabriel being
[12:18.320 --> 12:23.880]  surrounded by the stop-motion fruit from the Sledgehammer music video. Legendary music video.
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.660]  Haven't seen it. Absolutely. Maybe one of the best of all time. It's definitely up there.
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.780]  Like, he becomes a roller coaster. He's on a roller coaster. That's a good part.
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.300]  The roller coaster kind of drives... the train drives around his face for a bit, doesn't it?
[12:39.360 --> 12:44.780]  Right, yeah. There's also a good bit where his fists become sledgehammers and he punches himself
[12:44.780 --> 12:52.520]  in the face. So, Peter Gabriel is the fruit demon? In my opinion, he is and always has been the fruit
[12:52.520 --> 12:58.740]  demon. Saying stuff like, open up your fruit cage. Not that suggestive.
[13:01.540 --> 13:04.840]  Is that what Peter Gabriel looks like? Oh, not anymore.
[13:05.060 --> 13:11.300]  Not anymore. That's what he used to look like. Yeah, I assume. I just am realizing I've never
[13:11.300 --> 13:17.180]  seen Peter Gabriel. He's strictly a name I've heard. He was, I think, a pretty dreamy looking
[13:17.180 --> 13:25.020]  back of the day. Certainly to Gavin. I think he was fine looking. Now he just looks pissed off
[13:25.020 --> 13:30.880]  all the time. He looks... he's holding the mic out accusatorily in that photo that I just sent.
[13:31.240 --> 13:35.020]  Like, he's like, you did this. Oh, man. He looks like evil Billy Joel.
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.800]  He looks like a falconer. Open up your what?
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.940]  What? What? What? I thought... Gavin, I thought it was funny.
[13:44.920 --> 13:47.540]  That's how he used to look. Yeah, he's all right, isn't he?
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.000]  Yeah. Dreamy he is, according to Gavin. Yeah. He's British dreamy.
[13:54.420 --> 13:56.820]  Do you think it's a different kind of dreamy? Well, 100%.
[13:56.820 --> 14:00.900]  Oh, absolutely. Softer. Softer dreamy is British dreamy.
[14:01.240 --> 14:04.780]  Different features. A lot of people in the audience, based on last week's episode,
[14:05.840 --> 14:12.160]  thought that, with my ball knuckling idea, that I thought piss was stored in the balls.
[14:13.500 --> 14:17.120]  And I just want to let everyone know that I know it's not stored in the balls.
[14:20.460 --> 14:25.000]  I think everyone knows it's not stored in the balls because the amount of piss that comes out
[14:25.000 --> 14:30.320]  is maybe five to six times the volume of my balls. Very obvious. But I have drawn a diagram.
[14:30.540 --> 14:34.620]  Oh, my God. Just letting everyone know I mean to knuckle right here.
[14:35.180 --> 14:41.740]  And you see the urinary tract kind of curves down a little bit of a drip loop going on.
[14:41.740 --> 14:45.460]  You just want to knuckle that bit, that fold bit, and it just pushes out some extra drips.
[14:45.820 --> 14:48.720]  So just get in there. Is that your doody right there?
[14:49.280 --> 14:51.560]  Where? It looks like a big, brown, long curve.
[14:51.680 --> 14:53.240]  It's a huge, it's a huge shit.
[14:53.240 --> 14:56.380]  You got a huge log right next to your balls, dude.
[14:56.480 --> 14:58.680]  Oh, my God. Did you add the CPAP here?
[14:58.940 --> 15:00.100]  He also put CPAP here.
[15:00.300 --> 15:01.840]  I may have added a label to that.
[15:03.220 --> 15:05.100]  I didn't expect you to notice that, I'll be honest.
[15:07.460 --> 15:11.520]  What I appreciate about this is it started with Gavin addressing the fact that
[15:11.740 --> 15:14.940]  people thought he didn't know anything about how this works.
[15:15.480 --> 15:19.160]  And Gavin is really arguing that he knows way more than everybody else does.
[15:19.240 --> 15:22.860]  And here is an anatomic image to display
[15:23.420 --> 15:27.040]  how it would function within how the body actually works.
[15:27.600 --> 15:30.260]  Well, I know that it works based on doing it.
[15:30.400 --> 15:33.780]  So I looked up the image of where the piss, the piss tube goes.
[15:33.840 --> 15:36.300]  And I was like, oh, it makes sense that it works because the piss tube.
[15:36.960 --> 15:38.580]  You knuckle your balls?
[15:39.920 --> 15:40.880]  No, no.
[15:42.460 --> 15:45.540]  You just said I know it works because I've done it.
[15:45.540 --> 15:47.420]  Well, I mean, I've prodded that area.
[15:47.820 --> 15:49.120]  What does that mean?
[15:49.320 --> 15:51.560]  I've not used my knuckles to do it, but I have like...
[15:52.740 --> 15:54.380]  But why not your knuckles?
[15:55.300 --> 15:57.180]  It says knuckle here.
[15:57.540 --> 15:59.160]  Well, the angles are all wrong for a knuckle.
[16:01.800 --> 16:04.300]  These three ninjas are about to knuckle up on Gavin.
[16:06.960 --> 16:08.720]  Why are they knuckling up with their shoes?
[16:09.460 --> 16:10.500]  I don't I don't know.
[16:10.620 --> 16:13.500]  You're talking about knuckling up and then saying you haven't done it or whatever, man.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.900]  You've done it, but you haven't done it.
[16:14.960 --> 16:16.240]  You've done it, but you haven't done it.
[16:16.560 --> 16:19.940]  No, I've put pressure there to see if it gets some drips out.
[16:20.000 --> 16:20.340]  And it does.
[16:20.460 --> 16:25.840]  But I've not used my knuckle because I don't think I can get my whole fist down back there.
[16:26.340 --> 16:32.380]  What if we invent some sort of a plastic handheld knuckle that a guy can use in an event like this?
[16:32.460 --> 16:33.100]  I don't want to.
[16:33.100 --> 16:37.100]  Like a little back scratcher, but for bollock knuckling, like maybe hooked around.
[16:37.400 --> 16:39.100]  Yeah, like a hooked around back scratcher.
[16:39.140 --> 16:39.800]  That's a knuckler.
[16:40.140 --> 16:42.080]  Like a tube knuckler.
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.820]  I just I feel like Gavin suggested this in a way that was very hypothetical last week.
[16:47.880 --> 16:50.260]  And now it sounds like he's been doing this for years.
[16:50.760 --> 16:52.220]  I know I've not really not been doing it for years.
[16:52.260 --> 16:55.760]  I just like sometimes you want to move the balls around a little bit to get the drips out.
[16:55.840 --> 16:58.900]  And I'm saying it because it's putting the balls where the peas not stored.
[16:59.560 --> 17:01.280]  The balls where the peas are not stored.
[17:01.280 --> 17:02.480]  And the piss.
[17:02.740 --> 17:05.880]  You can also shake your penis, which is also where the pee isn't stored.
[17:06.280 --> 17:07.880]  But it still gets drips out.
[17:08.040 --> 17:08.520]  You don't have to.
[17:09.820 --> 17:11.220]  I don't like the way you said that.
[17:11.460 --> 17:11.640]  Yeah.
[17:12.680 --> 17:16.060]  I don't think I've ever peed and thought I got to move the balls around.
[17:16.660 --> 17:19.460]  I am surprised that I really like the way he said it.
[17:19.540 --> 17:21.240]  I kind of want him to say it again a few more times.
[17:21.760 --> 17:23.940]  So, Andrew, you've pissed, right?
[17:24.220 --> 17:24.800]  And then you...
[17:24.800 --> 17:25.440]  Yeah, I have.
[17:25.660 --> 17:26.740]  Just pull your boxes up.
[17:27.080 --> 17:27.440]  Tons.
[17:27.840 --> 17:28.460]  It was something.
[17:28.640 --> 17:29.380]  You ever pissed?
[17:29.880 --> 17:32.960]  You don't ever give the whole package a little shake just to...
[17:32.960 --> 17:33.600]  You won't believe this.
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.160]  Today, I did it today.
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.280]  Sorry, continue.
[17:36.880 --> 17:39.900]  So you finish pissing, you know, the last drips come out.
[17:39.980 --> 17:41.200]  And then what? You just pull up your boxes?
[17:41.760 --> 17:47.200]  I mean, I might do like shake, but I'm not fucking knuckling underneath my body and...
[17:47.200 --> 17:50.340]  Because you don't have the patented regulation tube knuckler.
[17:50.360 --> 17:51.180]  And here's the thing.
[17:51.460 --> 17:52.280]  It's like breathing.
[17:52.380 --> 17:54.360]  I don't necessarily think about the shake.
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.860]  I've never went like, oh man, I got to do something with the balls.
[17:57.860 --> 18:02.280]  The balls are like you're putting more thought into the pee than I ever have.
[18:02.620 --> 18:03.160]  It's all connected.
[18:03.340 --> 18:03.880]  Hey, Gav.
[18:04.220 --> 18:04.400]  Yeah.
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.780]  It's useless to explain this to him because he's too young to have experienced it.
[18:09.240 --> 18:13.700]  He'll get there and then he'll have his like light bulb moment and he'll go,
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.720]  oh fuck, now I know piss kung fu.
[18:16.880 --> 18:18.120]  I get what they were talking about.
[18:18.540 --> 18:20.480]  Well, I mean, Eric's becoming a bit of an old codger.
[18:20.660 --> 18:21.180]  What about you, Eric?
[18:21.260 --> 18:24.120]  Do you ever move stuff around and then get the last drips out?
[18:24.460 --> 18:26.640]  Yeah, I mean, you got to like squeeze a little bit,
[18:26.640 --> 18:29.060]  but I just kind of like do that internally and I feel fine.
[18:29.200 --> 18:29.760]  I just don't.
[18:29.840 --> 18:34.920]  When you talk about like grabbing your balls to shake them around to get piss out,
[18:35.300 --> 18:37.480]  I like, I think I know what you're saying,
[18:37.640 --> 18:40.580]  but the way you're sort of like lodging this is so bizarre.
[18:40.640 --> 18:43.500]  I'm not jingling it around like a purse of coins.
[18:43.740 --> 18:47.920]  I mean, you're talking about, you just, you, the other thing you said was shake your penis.
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.320]  So I just don't like the whole thing you're talking about is like,
[18:51.840 --> 18:52.200]  I don't know.
[18:52.240 --> 18:53.960]  And then you like want to speed bag it.
[18:54.040 --> 18:56.040]  I don't, I just don't understand any of this, man.
[18:56.040 --> 19:02.380]  I just am now visualizing Gavin with his long arm.
[19:02.480 --> 19:04.480]  I'm assuming you have long arms in my head.
[19:05.780 --> 19:08.300]  Fucking crouched like King Louie.
[19:08.580 --> 19:09.560]  I did do!
[19:11.340 --> 19:14.960]  Crouched like King Louie, just knuckling your balls.
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.400]  Look, look, it's very hard for me to explain what I do
[19:21.400 --> 19:23.360]  without showing you my penis and testicles.
[19:23.360 --> 19:29.960]  What I'm doing is, I'm just, I'm really just shaking the old cock a little bit
[19:29.960 --> 19:34.000]  and then maybe lifting the balls, getting a finger behind the balls
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.820]  and just lifting up and then some extra drips come out.
[19:37.400 --> 19:39.960]  I, yeah, once again, I get it.
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.360]  I think I understand and you just keep explaining it.
[19:42.580 --> 19:45.240]  It's the finger around the balls that's crazy.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.580]  There may, there might be the middle finger just as the balls are getting pushed.
[19:49.800 --> 19:52.280]  The middle fingers may be just going behind the balls and pushing.
[19:53.360 --> 19:55.180]  And then I thoroughly wash my hands.
[19:55.260 --> 19:58.480]  Do you hold the balls like you're displaying a fine necklace,
[19:58.540 --> 20:03.500]  like in a movie when they're selling jewelry and there's like the palm and extend it out?
[20:06.740 --> 20:08.040]  I'm so sorry, Gavin.
[20:08.300 --> 20:10.020]  I'm so on board with you right now.
[20:10.040 --> 20:13.460]  You did a terrible job of explaining it, but you're 100% right.
[20:14.480 --> 20:15.720]  It just sounds so...
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.700]  The bottom line is, the older you get, the longer and harder it is to get the pee out of you.
[20:21.700 --> 20:25.280]  And it only gets more complicated with every year.
[20:25.440 --> 20:28.560]  And I feel like I could keep flexing and squeezing internally like Eric,
[20:28.660 --> 20:30.280]  but it's just so much slower.
[20:30.560 --> 20:33.160]  Okay, stop posting pictures of King Louis.
[20:34.180 --> 20:35.060]  That's our thumbnail.
[20:35.500 --> 20:37.220]  That's 100% our thumbnail, thank you.
[20:38.580 --> 20:39.780]  This is how he does it.
[20:39.840 --> 20:41.160]  This is Gavin reaching around.
[20:41.700 --> 20:44.060]  Are you seated when you're doing this or are you standing?
[20:45.100 --> 20:46.040]  Well, either way.
[20:46.260 --> 20:46.700]  Either way.
[20:47.080 --> 20:48.260]  But usually I'll be seated.
[20:50.720 --> 20:51.680]  And, uh...
[20:52.230 --> 20:56.280]  But the whole point is, I don't have a long enough...
[20:56.280 --> 21:00.220]  I don't have a King Louis enough arm to actually get an entire fist back there.
[21:00.320 --> 21:01.280]  That's not what Andrew said.
[21:01.920 --> 21:03.060]  That's what I'm picturing.
[21:09.830 --> 21:12.570]  The King Louis thing is so funny to me.
[21:13.970 --> 21:15.050]  That's what I'm seeing.
[21:15.550 --> 21:16.270]  It's like King Louis.
[21:16.930 --> 21:19.550]  And the type of animal he is, how do you spell that?
[21:21.270 --> 21:23.870]  O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N.
[21:25.590 --> 21:26.230]  Right?
[21:27.030 --> 21:27.470]  Is that right?
[21:27.510 --> 21:29.190]  Or there's their G that's silent.
[21:31.150 --> 21:32.430]  You think...
[21:32.430 --> 21:35.250]  O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N?
[21:35.650 --> 21:36.190]  What are you...
[21:37.210 --> 21:38.030]  What are you?
[21:38.370 --> 21:38.610]  What?
[21:39.810 --> 21:40.450]  Orangutan?
[21:40.930 --> 21:41.470]  Orangutan?
[21:41.850 --> 21:42.450]  Orangutan?
[21:42.990 --> 21:44.890]  Orangutan is how you spell it.
[21:45.170 --> 21:45.530]  Orangutan.
[21:46.410 --> 21:47.050]  Orangutan.
[21:47.370 --> 21:48.610]  You fucked me up now.
[21:48.610 --> 21:50.030]  It's Orangutan, right?
[21:50.310 --> 21:51.550]  It is Orangutan, yeah.
[21:51.650 --> 21:52.110]  As soon...
[21:52.110 --> 21:52.690]  When you said silent G...
[21:52.690 --> 21:53.750]  But I thought it was Orangutan.
[21:54.010 --> 21:55.470]  It was an old episode thing.
[21:56.250 --> 21:58.310]  I spent my whole life thinking it was Orangutan.
[21:59.650 --> 22:01.550]  You said that and it like...
[22:02.250 --> 22:04.970]  I could feel like my brain like splitting in half.
[22:05.030 --> 22:06.810]  You will hear Orangutan in the wild.
[22:06.930 --> 22:08.670]  There are plenty of people that think it's Orangutan.
[22:08.910 --> 22:10.390]  I'm not alone when I thought that.
[22:10.710 --> 22:12.270]  And then it blew my mind when I heard Orangutan.
[22:12.590 --> 22:13.350]  We've covered this.
[22:13.410 --> 22:14.630]  This is old face material.
[22:14.830 --> 22:15.510]  We've been through this.
[22:16.370 --> 22:18.210]  It's old news, but I just, I can't...
[22:19.110 --> 22:21.390]  You crouched or like hunched over.
[22:22.030 --> 22:23.830]  Massaging your balls for the pee to come out.
[22:23.830 --> 22:24.730]  Why am I hunched over?
[22:26.350 --> 22:28.950]  So your long arms can reach.
[22:30.930 --> 22:32.330]  I'm going down the front.
[22:32.450 --> 22:33.210]  I don't need to hunch.
[22:36.970 --> 22:40.750]  That becomes dangerous because your arm becomes in the path potentially.
[22:41.170 --> 22:41.910]  Yeah, risky.
[22:42.390 --> 22:44.910]  No, and also I washed my hands after...
[22:44.910 --> 22:46.270]  After getting pee on them?
[22:46.310 --> 22:47.070]  After a big old piss.
[22:48.770 --> 22:50.930]  No, he doesn't get pee on him, Nick.
[22:50.970 --> 22:51.910]  He gets ball.
[22:52.090 --> 22:53.110]  He gets balls at him.
[22:54.050 --> 22:54.570]  Insane.
[22:54.850 --> 22:58.270]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[22:58.630 --> 23:01.510]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[23:01.650 --> 23:05.190]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.

[23:09.790 --> 23:14.630]  Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?

[23:38.630 --> 23:39.590]  Terms and conditions apply.
[23:39.890 --> 23:41.770]  I did occasionally, when I had the...
[23:41.770 --> 23:44.490]  Like before this was so much of a problem, I did have the toilet,
[23:45.030 --> 23:49.930]  the automatic toilet where it flushes for you and I would just try and not use my hands at any point.
[23:50.770 --> 23:51.170]  What?
[23:53.070 --> 23:54.690]  Hang on, what?
[23:56.030 --> 23:56.430]  What?
[23:56.830 --> 23:58.110]  You would go in...
[23:58.110 --> 24:00.190]  He'd make a game of it, it's great.
[24:00.290 --> 24:03.070]  You would open up and then you would just like...
[24:03.630 --> 24:05.670]  I feel like I've said too much this episode.
[24:06.110 --> 24:06.510]  I've talked too much.
[24:06.510 --> 24:07.850]  No, no, no, no, continue.
[24:08.270 --> 24:11.090]  If anything, you haven't said enough.
[24:11.090 --> 24:15.450]  So my argument that I used to have with Meg was like,
[24:15.630 --> 24:18.870]  surely I don't need to wash my hands if this is how I pee, right?
[24:19.170 --> 24:23.170]  And I'd go in the bog, pull down the old shorts and undies from the side,
[24:24.090 --> 24:30.110]  bog seat opens, I sort of squat, I do a little piss, I shake it around, get all those drips off,
[24:30.510 --> 24:31.470]  and then I pull it all up.
[24:32.110 --> 24:34.210]  The bog flushes itself and closes the lid.
[24:34.710 --> 24:35.570]  Do I need to wash my hands?
[24:35.870 --> 24:36.610]  You touched a lot.
[24:37.690 --> 24:40.830]  Jeff just gave us the thumbnail.
[24:41.090 --> 24:46.090]  In the middle of the episode, this King Louie, he's pointing at his mouth,
[24:46.510 --> 24:51.190]  he's pointing at his tummy, and he's got his big hand going behind him.
[24:52.490 --> 24:55.290]  You know this guy doesn't wash his hands after he pisses.
[24:55.370 --> 24:55.810]  Check him out.
[24:56.050 --> 24:56.310]  Oh, no.
[24:57.110 --> 24:58.030]  You don't lock the door?
[24:58.630 --> 25:00.550]  That's Gavin celebrating after a clean pee.
[25:00.790 --> 25:01.750]  He's like, I did it.
[25:02.190 --> 25:02.710]  Flawless.
[25:03.230 --> 25:04.950]  He's just pointing at his bananas, really.
[25:05.430 --> 25:10.530]  That's Gavin exposing himself to Meg saying, look at me, I'm spotless, clean.
[25:11.410 --> 25:15.970]  But what I realized I was doing is I was washing my hands for no reason.
[25:16.570 --> 25:18.170]  And then I was just like, I don't need to be doing this.
[25:18.330 --> 25:22.530]  I feel like this is insane discourse from somebody who has given me shit
[25:22.530 --> 25:26.970]  for eating in the bathroom when I haven't used the bathroom.
[25:27.370 --> 25:30.930]  You put, you put a bowl of muffin on the toilet seat.
[25:31.150 --> 25:32.330]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:33.210 --> 25:34.350]  On top of the lid.
[25:35.150 --> 25:36.270]  When it was down.
[25:37.630 --> 25:38.690]  In a bowl.
[25:39.190 --> 25:39.730]  It's dirty.
[25:39.730 --> 25:42.830]  Yeah, but you're sitting on it.
[25:43.210 --> 25:44.350]  What do you mean I'm sitting on it?
[25:44.710 --> 25:45.490]  You're sitting.
[25:46.610 --> 25:48.010]  I'm not sitting on a muffin.
[25:51.270 --> 25:57.210]  You think you can literally use the bathroom flush and then walk out without washing your hands.
[25:57.350 --> 25:59.770]  I think that's way worse than me.
[25:59.790 --> 26:00.210]  I didn't touch anything.
[26:00.770 --> 26:02.830]  I could have put my hands in my pocket the whole time.
[26:02.950 --> 26:05.810]  I mean, if my trousers were down, I would need long arms.
[26:05.810 --> 26:07.690]  The water's moving around.
[26:07.910 --> 26:08.850]  The seas are shifting.
[26:09.090 --> 26:10.710]  Particles are flying everywhere.
[26:11.270 --> 26:15.010]  So why am I not washing my back and my neck every time I go to the toilet?
[26:15.110 --> 26:15.810]  That's a good question.
[26:16.210 --> 26:17.090]  It's a good question.
[26:17.530 --> 26:18.290]  Probably should.
[26:20.210 --> 26:21.070]  Probably should.
[26:21.210 --> 26:23.750]  My point is, is you're shooting particles everywhere.
[26:24.090 --> 26:25.090]  I'm not doing anything.
[26:26.830 --> 26:28.310]  I'm not doing anything.
[26:28.650 --> 26:29.790]  You're eating.
[26:30.690 --> 26:34.790]  Lid down the whole time in a separate bowl.
[26:34.790 --> 26:37.810]  You put your headphones on the butt crumb zone.
[26:38.350 --> 26:39.570]  Yeah, I did do that.
[26:39.910 --> 26:41.110]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[26:41.310 --> 26:43.390]  And that's going right by your face and in your ears.
[26:43.450 --> 26:44.230]  You got poo here.
[26:45.190 --> 26:47.470]  Well, you got fucking ball hands.
[26:47.750 --> 26:48.330]  What do you mean?
[26:48.610 --> 26:49.610]  We're a dynamic duo.
[26:50.930 --> 26:53.590]  I can wash my ears, dummy.
[26:54.190 --> 26:56.110]  You put your headphones in the shower.
[26:56.430 --> 26:57.410]  There's a shower.
[26:58.810 --> 27:00.910]  They're so easily washable.
[27:01.970 --> 27:03.830]  I do it all the time.
[27:06.490 --> 27:08.070]  And I say that lovingly.
[27:08.150 --> 27:11.250]  I call you dummy lovingly because I'm equally dumb in this.
[27:11.630 --> 27:12.790]  But you're being ridiculous.
[27:13.090 --> 27:16.310]  I wash my hands like I don't wash my face.
[27:19.180 --> 27:20.740]  What are you saying?
[27:23.940 --> 27:29.380]  You use the headphones outside of the toilet, outside of the bath as well.
[27:30.080 --> 27:32.620]  You get clean and then you put dirty headphones on your face.
[27:32.620 --> 27:34.720]  You use your hands outside as well.
[27:35.740 --> 27:36.960]  What do you mean?
[27:37.080 --> 27:38.060]  I've washed them.
[27:38.400 --> 27:40.100]  I've washed my ears.
[27:40.160 --> 27:41.420]  I'm talking about the headphones.
[27:41.580 --> 27:44.120]  You don't wash your headphones after you've got out of the bath.
[27:44.220 --> 27:45.660]  But I wash my head every day.
[27:51.020 --> 27:54.800]  Sorry, I can't come into the room right now.
[27:54.860 --> 27:55.660]  I gotta wash my head.
[27:57.860 --> 27:58.880]  Give him a nice wash.
[27:59.760 --> 28:01.120]  I'm not using the same headphones.
[28:01.320 --> 28:04.100]  You've thrown out a dummy today and earlier you threw out a stupid.
[28:05.000 --> 28:05.400]  Yeah.
[28:05.680 --> 28:07.860]  Well, you've had a really dumb day, which I relate.
[28:08.080 --> 28:12.340]  So I need to like really put the spotlight on whenever anyone has one of those.
[28:12.460 --> 28:12.920]  Because it's typically...
[28:12.920 --> 28:14.420]  You didn't call me stupid.
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.420]  Oh, wait, was that aimed at me?
[28:16.900 --> 28:18.600]  I think it was because it had to have been.
[28:18.660 --> 28:19.560]  It doesn't matter where it...
[28:20.140 --> 28:23.100]  You've kind of been the dumb one every time today.
[28:23.600 --> 28:24.860]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:25.400 --> 28:26.060]  Oh, man.
[28:26.540 --> 28:28.040]  So what else is new?
[28:31.240 --> 28:32.540]  That's how we ended that?
[28:32.620 --> 28:33.260]  That's awesome.
[28:33.260 --> 28:35.980]  I don't even remember what that was in the...
[28:35.980 --> 28:37.780]  I don't even remember how that started.
[28:37.980 --> 28:39.000]  What were you guys arguing about?
[28:39.040 --> 28:41.740]  Well, to summarize, though, do I need to wash my hands if that's how I pissed?
[28:42.280 --> 28:42.660]  Probably.
[28:43.100 --> 28:46.000]  I mean, based on your general code of ethics, yes.
[28:46.400 --> 28:46.700]  Yeah.
[28:47.160 --> 28:47.500]  Yeah.
[28:47.880 --> 28:49.180]  I just think it's crazy.
[28:49.420 --> 28:51.320]  It's like what you're talking about is like...
[28:51.320 --> 28:54.140]  You're like a step away from like how a dog pisses.
[28:54.720 --> 28:55.540]  I could...
[28:55.540 --> 28:57.820]  You're doing like a bathroom dog piss, dude.
[28:58.160 --> 29:00.840]  What if I put a GoPro on my chest filming forwards
[29:00.840 --> 29:05.580]  and I constantly film my hands the entire time and I show you the entire process?
[29:05.700 --> 29:06.320]  Hey, man.
[29:06.520 --> 29:07.480]  No, thank you.
[29:08.060 --> 29:11.700]  Hey, what if I put a big wide angle lens on my head and then point it down towards my dick?
[29:11.900 --> 29:12.780]  You guys want to see that?
[29:14.380 --> 29:15.280]  It's my chest.
[29:15.340 --> 29:16.620]  How can I look down with my chest?
[29:16.780 --> 29:18.460]  I don't want to see any of it.
[29:18.620 --> 29:19.900]  I don't want to see it.
[29:20.200 --> 29:21.020]  I don't want to see it.
[29:21.300 --> 29:22.400]  Nick wants... Nick can't wait.
[29:22.600 --> 29:23.300]  Nick wants to see it.
[29:23.400 --> 29:24.740]  Your hands don't touch anything.
[29:24.860 --> 29:25.580]  They don't flush.
[29:25.660 --> 29:26.880]  They don't take your pants down.
[29:26.960 --> 29:28.160]  They don't touch the lid.
[29:28.160 --> 29:31.680]  The only thing they touch is like the pockets area of my shorts.
[29:32.080 --> 29:34.600]  And I sort of grab through to get the boxes down too.
[29:34.680 --> 29:35.980]  But it's the particles, man.
[29:36.480 --> 29:37.620]  The particles get you.
[29:38.060 --> 29:38.740]  He's got you there.
[29:39.220 --> 29:43.000]  Okay, so what if I keep my hands in the hoodie pouch?
[29:43.940 --> 29:45.000]  I mean, once the...
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.140]  Like, I feel like you're just doing so much work to just not wash your hands.
[29:48.400 --> 29:49.540]  If you're able to...
[29:49.540 --> 29:50.060]  I'll say this.
[29:50.100 --> 29:53.240]  If you're able to walk into a bathroom with your hands in your hoodie pouch,
[29:55.060 --> 29:56.880]  disrobe to the degree that you can pee,
[29:56.880 --> 30:00.820]  pee, re-robe, flush,
[30:01.520 --> 30:06.700]  and then leave the room without those hands ever leaving your hoodie pocket,
[30:07.200 --> 30:07.880]  I think you're fine.
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.240]  How does he get his dick out?
[30:09.780 --> 30:11.940]  That's not what we're talking about.
[30:12.100 --> 30:12.700]  We're talking about...
[30:12.700 --> 30:13.700]  It is the slide, he said.
[30:13.980 --> 30:15.780]  If he can figure it out, he can figure it out.
[30:15.820 --> 30:17.680]  If your hands don't leave that hoodie pocket, you're fine.
[30:18.020 --> 30:18.680]  I will say what you're...
[30:18.680 --> 30:24.900]  I feel like undervaluing is that it is just a nice practice to wash your hands
[30:24.900 --> 30:26.300]  because you're doing other stuff.
[30:26.300 --> 30:26.980]  Yeah.
[30:27.180 --> 30:30.960]  There's an implication that your hands aren't dirty from other things you've done.
[30:31.680 --> 30:36.600]  So even if it is a clean bathroom run, it just is a good excuse to wash your hands.
[30:36.700 --> 30:38.840]  Yeah, I mean, I wash my hands probably 10 times a day.
[30:38.940 --> 30:41.980]  I mean, most of the time I wash my hands before I go to the bathroom
[30:41.980 --> 30:43.740]  because I don't want to touch my dick with dirty hands.
[30:44.900 --> 30:47.020]  You got such a clean dick, you don't want to get it dirty?
[30:47.460 --> 30:50.080]  I don't want him to get it dirtier than what my dick do.
[30:50.180 --> 30:52.920]  It's fucking hiding all nice and clean on my underwear every day.
[30:53.260 --> 30:54.880]  My dick gets treated like a fucking king.
[30:54.880 --> 30:57.300]  It wakes up, it gets a shower every day.
[30:57.560 --> 31:00.140]  Then it gets taken to go pee-pee and then it does that.
[31:00.220 --> 31:04.360]  And then it gets brand new clean clothes that are fresh put on it.
[31:04.500 --> 31:08.440]  And then it gets left alone all day long unless I need to take it out to whiz every once in a while.
[31:08.600 --> 31:11.400]  Why do I want to incorporate dirt and grime into that situation?
[31:11.520 --> 31:13.740]  You spend so much time keeping it clean and fresh.
[31:13.940 --> 31:15.140]  We can't do this.
[31:15.380 --> 31:19.820]  But I remember in kindergarten when they taught us how to wash our hands properly,
[31:19.820 --> 31:27.060]  they did a thing where they put like some sort of like dye or substance on our hands.
[31:27.200 --> 31:28.940]  And then we had to wash our hands with soap.
[31:29.080 --> 31:33.600]  And they could tell if we missed a spot by like using like a purple light.
[31:33.620 --> 31:38.260]  If there were specks, I was doing a Jeff Dick speck.
[31:38.460 --> 31:40.280]  Then the speck should have cleaned his dick.
[31:40.360 --> 31:41.200]  Isn't it so funny?
[31:42.180 --> 31:43.780]  I'm into it. Let's do it.
[31:48.460 --> 31:51.180]  Oh, sorry, you're going to say something, Gavin. I apologize.
[31:52.080 --> 31:53.220]  Oh, I'm sure it was worthless.
[31:59.720 --> 32:00.960]  We got to get our dick.
[32:01.300 --> 32:04.740]  I had a thing happen that filled me with so much joy.
[32:04.820 --> 32:09.860]  It made me one of my favorite coincidences of all time happen recently.
[32:10.520 --> 32:12.820]  I don't know. Part of this was in a recording.
[32:12.820 --> 32:15.740]  I was trying to talk to Nick about it yesterday, and we couldn't
[32:15.740 --> 32:20.980]  remember if it was between something or if it was said somewhere.
[32:21.120 --> 32:22.240]  So maybe it was captured.
[32:22.480 --> 32:27.020]  But we recently discovered Jeff has a new word that he hates.
[32:27.320 --> 32:28.960]  Word that he despises.
[32:29.680 --> 32:34.660]  Oh, not a fan of a very specific word, which is collab.
[32:35.320 --> 32:36.160]  Jeff hates collab.
[32:36.620 --> 32:37.220]  I hate that word.
[32:37.340 --> 32:38.860]  He really dislikes collab.
[32:40.500 --> 32:42.340]  And it's been coming up a lot recently.
[32:42.340 --> 32:45.340]  We talked about the rooster teeth coming back or whatever.
[32:46.120 --> 32:50.700]  And Jeff, we've determined hates collab in a way that I don't necessarily understand.
[32:51.000 --> 32:51.980]  But you hate it.
[32:52.060 --> 32:52.700]  And that's fine.
[32:52.960 --> 32:53.580]  I don't need to.
[32:53.720 --> 32:54.340]  You hate it.
[32:54.780 --> 32:54.960]  Yeah.
[32:55.540 --> 32:56.580]  Do you just hate abbreviations?
[32:57.180 --> 33:00.480]  I don't like abbreviation for abbreviation sake.
[33:00.920 --> 33:01.860]  Like, I also don't like...
[33:03.280 --> 33:05.460]  Collab is right up there with me for za.
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.440]  I don't like when someone... just say pizza.
[33:08.760 --> 33:09.740]  Like, was it that hard?
[33:09.740 --> 33:12.660]  Was the other syllable that fucking hard to get out?
[33:13.100 --> 33:16.920]  Are you in such a goddamn food hurry you can't say the first part?
[33:17.280 --> 33:18.020]  No, you're not.
[33:18.080 --> 33:20.320]  Just say pizza, not za.
[33:20.600 --> 33:21.220]  I don't have to...
[33:21.220 --> 33:24.520]  I have to do the fucking mental gymnastics to stop for a second and go,
[33:24.520 --> 33:27.340]  wait a minute, this person said something incorrect and stupid.
[33:27.540 --> 33:34.740]  Let me slow down my brain to go backwards to figure out what this dumb ass is trying to convey
[33:34.740 --> 33:40.040]  because they can't use complex fucking five letter words properly.
[33:40.840 --> 33:43.320]  So this is a whole other layer of hate that we didn't get.
[33:43.320 --> 33:45.720]  By the same token, I don't like the word collab.
[33:46.080 --> 33:48.240]  Oh, hey, we should collab together.
[33:48.460 --> 33:49.180]  Hey, what's up, buddy?
[33:49.240 --> 33:50.620]  You want to collab with me?
[33:50.700 --> 33:51.500]  I play video games.
[33:51.580 --> 33:51.960]  You play video games.
[33:52.160 --> 33:52.820]  Let's collab.
[33:53.300 --> 33:55.340]  How about, hey, do you want to make some content together?
[33:55.540 --> 33:56.840]  Would you like to make a video with me?
[33:56.880 --> 33:57.980]  Do you ever want to do a Let's Play?
[33:58.180 --> 33:58.780]  We can do that.
[33:59.080 --> 34:01.080]  Would you like to collaborate on a project?
[34:01.280 --> 34:02.800]  Not like finger guns out.
[34:02.800 --> 34:04.300]  Hey, you want to collab?
[34:05.540 --> 34:06.400]  Internet, right?
[34:06.520 --> 34:06.720]  Woo.
[34:06.860 --> 34:08.480]  Web 2.0, suck my dick.
[34:13.040 --> 34:13.640]  Nice and clear.
[34:14.400 --> 34:18.540]  It was, I mean, that is like an annoyance you have with unnecessary abbreviation.
[34:18.940 --> 34:22.080]  At the time, it just seemed like you were annoyed at even the definition of the word
[34:22.080 --> 34:23.100]  and how it was being used.
[34:23.560 --> 34:24.160]  You're like, collab.
[34:24.220 --> 34:25.020]  What does that even mean?
[34:25.220 --> 34:25.540]  Collab.
[34:25.860 --> 34:28.340]  I worked for fucking 20 years with these people.
[34:29.060 --> 34:29.260]  Collab.
[34:29.580 --> 34:30.620]  You don't have to say that to me.
[34:30.660 --> 34:31.620]  Hey, man, you want to collab?
[34:31.720 --> 34:33.160]  It's like, who do you think I am?
[34:33.220 --> 34:35.180]  Of course, we make content together all goddamn long.
[34:35.180 --> 34:37.040]  Just say, hey, do you want to make some fucking content together?
[34:37.200 --> 34:38.360]  You don't have to buzzword me.
[34:38.440 --> 34:39.180]  We know each other.
[34:39.640 --> 34:42.780]  I feel like everything involving collabs in general is really annoying.
[34:42.900 --> 34:46.240]  Like, you get all those emails where it's like, this, x, that.
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.900]  Why is it an x, though?
[34:48.480 --> 34:51.780]  Because that's even cooler to, well, even cooler way to say collab.
[34:52.260 --> 34:53.620]  But surely it should be a plus.
[34:53.980 --> 34:56.300]  Like, you're not multiplying my thing by your thing.
[34:57.180 --> 34:58.420]  You're adding them together.
[34:58.600 --> 34:59.900]  It doesn't make, why is it the x?
[35:00.500 --> 35:00.920]  I don't know.
[35:01.160 --> 35:01.400]  That's a great question.
[35:01.580 --> 35:02.580]  It is a great question.
[35:03.080 --> 35:06.500]  But it should be a fucking, it should be a division symbol,
[35:06.500 --> 35:08.680]  because what you're doing is you're making your content half as good
[35:08.680 --> 35:10.220]  and their content half as good at the same time.
[35:13.240 --> 35:14.420]  Well, shouldn't it be a minus?
[35:15.000 --> 35:15.740]  Even better.
[35:18.480 --> 35:19.280]  Oh, well.
[35:20.940 --> 35:24.460]  Bernie, who bought Rooster Teeth back, has a podcast called Morning Somewhere,
[35:24.560 --> 35:26.740]  and they did a Q&A talking about the Rooster Teeth stuff.
[35:27.060 --> 35:30.840]  And in that Q&A, they addressed the questions of, like,
[35:30.840 --> 35:33.580]  working with people that were previously associated with the company.
[35:33.860 --> 35:36.820]  I have a clip relating to that that I'm going to play.
[35:37.420 --> 35:38.380]  Oh, OK.
[35:40.500 --> 35:40.820]  Maybe.
[35:41.140 --> 35:42.340]  Not so easy, is it?
[35:44.760 --> 35:45.360]  Got him.
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.380]  So so if you if you do talk to people, I can't control what anyone does.
[35:49.380 --> 35:52.980]  But if you do talk to people, I would I would appreciate personally
[35:52.980 --> 35:56.120]  if you would use the word collaborate instead of go back.
[35:56.220 --> 35:58.420]  Go back is, I think, kind of insane.
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.660]  I I have never laughed harder at something that was so innocent,
[36:06.660 --> 36:14.140]  like he was trying to frame that in a way that is so caring for the people related to it.
[36:14.460 --> 36:17.940]  And I just went, everyone's going to ask Jeff if he's going to collab.
[36:18.080 --> 36:19.920]  They're all going to use collab.
[36:20.560 --> 36:23.560]  This is the greatest thing that's happened all year.
[36:24.460 --> 36:27.780]  He didn't even he didn't know that wasn't a planned attack.
[36:27.840 --> 36:29.100]  He was trying to be sweet.
[36:29.100 --> 36:30.520]  And you fucking hate collab.
[36:30.740 --> 36:31.760]  It's the worst thing.
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.740]  It's the worst thing anyone could say to you.
[36:35.100 --> 36:40.280]  And he he said, if you could do it for me personally, it's so good.
[36:40.500 --> 36:41.400]  Oh, my God.
[36:41.560 --> 36:44.280]  Oh, I haven't texted Bernie in months.
[36:44.340 --> 36:46.520]  And I texted him and said, hey, can I clip?
[36:46.620 --> 36:49.100]  Can I clip the regulation?
[36:49.980 --> 36:50.940]  Something happened.
[36:52.360 --> 36:53.320]  Oh, collab.
[36:54.060 --> 36:57.320]  So, Jeff, are you do you have any plans to collab?
[37:00.960 --> 37:02.880]  It's such a currently.
[37:03.020 --> 37:03.500]  No, I'm not.
[37:03.620 --> 37:05.840]  I'm not doing any collabs at the moment.
[37:05.940 --> 37:11.520]  I'm still, you know, I'm accepting collab pitches from people that are interested in collabing
[37:11.520 --> 37:13.240]  with me in the future at some point.
[37:13.320 --> 37:17.080]  I don't currently have any collabs on the books.
[37:17.180 --> 37:21.340]  Now, a very sweet gesture from from Bernie and a really thoughtful thing to do and say,
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.960]  just used a dog shit word to do it.
[37:28.810 --> 37:29.690]  That's OK.
[37:29.690 --> 37:30.970]  Not everybody's perfect, right?
[37:31.510 --> 37:32.470]  No, absolutely not.
[37:32.550 --> 37:36.170]  I mean, we got a fucking guy on your show that knuckles his balls every time he pees.
[37:36.850 --> 37:38.510]  I don't knuckle it, I just want the knuckling.
[37:38.970 --> 37:40.570]  I want the automatic knuckling.
[37:40.830 --> 37:42.730]  He wants somebody to knuckle it for him.
[37:42.870 --> 37:46.190]  I want someone to speed bag my balls so I get all the piss out.
[37:46.270 --> 37:46.970]  What's the problem?
[37:47.350 --> 37:48.470]  It's not a speed bag.
[37:48.630 --> 37:50.030]  It's just a gentle push.
[37:51.590 --> 37:58.530]  I really like this story, by the way, of the of the mind table where I guess Eric's label vanished.
[37:58.530 --> 38:00.590]  And yeah, what the fuck?
[38:00.770 --> 38:02.090]  So they just wrote idiot.
[38:04.150 --> 38:05.990]  Eric's got a speech bubble that says idiot.
[38:06.110 --> 38:08.910]  But because his label's gone, it just looks like he's labeled an idiot.
[38:10.630 --> 38:13.790]  I replied to them and I just said, hey, what the fuck?
[38:15.870 --> 38:18.430]  And that was drawn by Sabrina, I think.
[38:18.510 --> 38:19.730]  Yeah, she did a great job.
[38:19.830 --> 38:21.810]  I actually I love this art style.
[38:21.990 --> 38:24.590]  I think this is like such a cool look.
[38:24.590 --> 38:28.210]  And then to have my label gone and it just says idiot.
[38:28.470 --> 38:30.990]  It's like, what the hey, what the fuck is this shit?
[38:32.150 --> 38:35.790]  I love that Andrew's in the TV with the mic on our end.
[38:35.890 --> 38:38.890]  And I love that you can see Nick through the monkey helmet.
[38:40.110 --> 38:43.330]  So the head of the table, it's wherever the host sits.
[38:43.990 --> 38:44.370]  Okay.
[38:46.870 --> 38:49.290]  I'm just confirming the head of the table is wherever the host sits.
[38:49.290 --> 38:50.250]  That's what we learned, right?
[38:50.970 --> 38:51.190]  Yeah.
[38:52.110 --> 38:54.750]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[38:55.150 --> 38:58.390]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[38:58.850 --> 39:00.630]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[39:00.850 --> 39:04.070]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.

[39:08.770 --> 39:12.230]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[39:12.610 --> 39:14.510]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[39:17.750 --> 39:19.030]  Hey, it's Paris.
[39:19.450 --> 39:21.590]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[39:21.590 --> 39:22.610]  Like stars.
[39:23.110 --> 39:23.350]  Duh.
[39:23.910 --> 39:27.470]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[39:28.070 --> 39:32.390]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[39:32.870 --> 39:37.070]  making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop.
[39:37.810 --> 39:40.130]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[39:40.610 --> 39:41.350]  That's hot.
[39:42.010 --> 39:45.070]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[39:45.430 --> 39:46.770]  Hilton for the stay.
[39:47.550 --> 39:48.430]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[39:49.330 --> 39:53.930]  Let's say you go get a hamburger and french fries somewhere for lunch with some friends.
[39:54.330 --> 39:54.750]  Okay.
[39:54.950 --> 39:55.190]  Okay.
[39:55.190 --> 39:55.990]  Onions? No onions?
[39:58.010 --> 40:01.950]  Inconsequential to this particular scenario, but we do...
[40:01.950 --> 40:04.530]  I assume we were going to go do the onions thing later today,
[40:04.610 --> 40:05.890]  but I assume that pushes to next week.
[40:05.990 --> 40:07.030]  Probably when we do the other thing.
[40:07.330 --> 40:07.550]  Yeah.
[40:07.930 --> 40:08.190]  Okay.
[40:08.970 --> 40:10.110]  Do you add a squeezy bottle of ketchup?
[40:12.470 --> 40:14.250]  The hamburger tray is full.
[40:14.370 --> 40:16.350]  It's full of fries and then a hamburger.
[40:16.470 --> 40:17.450]  There's no free space.
[40:17.450 --> 40:18.830]  So you just...
[40:18.830 --> 40:21.250]  What do you do with your ketchup if you want to put ketchup on the fries?
[40:22.710 --> 40:23.670]  I'll go out a corner.
[40:24.270 --> 40:24.410]  Interesting.
[40:24.410 --> 40:24.910]  It depends.
[40:25.730 --> 40:29.950]  There's a lot of situations I've been in where I don't have the ketchup real estate for it.
[40:30.510 --> 40:31.190]  Do you have multiple...
[40:31.190 --> 40:31.790]  There's no...
[40:31.790 --> 40:33.270]  There is no ketchup real estate.
[40:33.750 --> 40:35.330]  That's what I'm saying where I have to make it.
[40:35.910 --> 40:36.090]  Yeah.
[40:36.210 --> 40:38.090]  I've done a thing where I've had...
[40:39.910 --> 40:41.050]  Sometimes the lid...
[40:41.750 --> 40:45.430]  I'll take the lid off of a thing and then I'll shoot it into the top of the lid.
[40:45.950 --> 40:46.630]  And I'll use that.
[40:46.630 --> 40:47.510]  That was no lid.
[40:47.730 --> 40:48.170]  No lid?
[40:48.650 --> 40:49.470]  No, lid's not available.
[40:49.910 --> 40:50.090]  Okay.
[40:50.170 --> 40:50.950]  Do I have a second...
[40:51.870 --> 40:57.010]  You know how like if you get chicken strips and fries, you get two different boxes?
[40:57.230 --> 40:58.330]  Here's what you can do.
[40:58.610 --> 40:58.870]  Okay.
[40:58.990 --> 41:02.250]  You could put a napkin on the table and load that up with ketchup if you want.
[41:02.330 --> 41:07.090]  That's the only other option you have outside of the bag or the current vessel.
[41:09.770 --> 41:11.210]  And what am I eating, sir?
[41:11.550 --> 41:12.810]  Just a burger and fries.
[41:12.990 --> 41:13.810]  Burger and fries.
[41:15.770 --> 41:17.750]  Honestly, I'm probably shooting it in the corner.
[41:18.930 --> 41:20.690]  If I'm not going to do that...
[41:20.690 --> 41:22.190]  And hear me out, because this is going to...
[41:22.190 --> 41:23.010]  What's on my burger?
[41:26.430 --> 41:27.150]  Cheese, onion...
[41:27.150 --> 41:27.910]  Onions. Yeah, for sure, onions.
[41:29.110 --> 41:30.850]  Pickle and tomato.
[41:31.410 --> 41:31.730]  If I'm...
[41:31.730 --> 41:32.270]  Oh yeah, okay.
[41:32.950 --> 41:34.730]  Like if it's a situation where I think...
[41:34.730 --> 41:35.610]  Lettuce as well. Lettuce as well.
[41:35.870 --> 41:38.530]  Because I don't want to drown any of the fries in ketchup.
[41:38.610 --> 41:40.010]  But I do want ketchup in the mix.
[41:40.850 --> 41:47.870]  I might disassemble my burger and use the lower bun as a dippable surface.
[41:48.030 --> 41:49.530]  Well, you're a maniac.
[41:49.750 --> 41:51.150]  You need the bottom.
[41:51.210 --> 41:51.930]  It's the foundation.
[41:52.030 --> 41:52.650]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:52.850 --> 41:54.270]  I'm not getting rid of it. Hear me out.
[41:55.630 --> 41:56.650]  Deassemble, right?
[41:57.010 --> 41:58.090]  Put the burger to the side.
[41:58.730 --> 41:59.670]  Use the lower bun.
[42:00.170 --> 42:02.810]  Pour ketchup on the lower bun, on top of it.
[42:03.350 --> 42:05.650]  Dip the fries into the bun.
[42:06.310 --> 42:09.450]  And then when I'm done with that, reassemble the burger.
[42:09.450 --> 42:11.870]  But then you can't eat any burger while you're eating fries.
[42:12.010 --> 42:13.030]  What if you want to go back and forth?
[42:13.150 --> 42:15.010]  And your hamburger is cold now.
[42:15.070 --> 42:16.770]  You took the roof off of it and let all the heat out.
[42:16.810 --> 42:18.910]  I typically am a one and then the other guy.
[42:19.250 --> 42:20.250]  Oh, psychopath.
[42:21.550 --> 42:24.550]  I want each bite to be as uniform as possible.
[42:24.630 --> 42:26.550]  I want as much stuff all at once.
[42:27.570 --> 42:31.790]  I feel like I watched a clip once, 15 years ago,
[42:32.330 --> 42:36.850]  that you should eat the meat last from a digestive purpose.
[42:37.410 --> 42:42.990]  So I typically will eat all of the vegetables before I touch the protein on my plate.
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.880]  But surely if your stomach is digesting all the veg,
[42:49.020 --> 42:50.300]  then the meat is just sat on it.
[42:50.720 --> 42:51.400]  You would think.
[42:51.800 --> 42:52.880]  And that could be right.
[42:53.240 --> 42:56.020]  But it is a code that I've lived by for over a decade
[42:56.020 --> 42:58.580]  because I feel like I've heard that once.
[42:59.060 --> 42:59.720]  Yeah, there you go.
[43:00.120 --> 43:01.400]  Could easily be wrong.
[43:01.480 --> 43:03.780]  I'm not arguing that this is definitely right.
[43:04.280 --> 43:06.140]  I took a picture of what Jeff did.
[43:06.180 --> 43:06.640]  Do you want to see it?
[43:07.020 --> 43:07.460]  Please.
[43:07.460 --> 43:09.820]  I don't think what I did was a big deal at all.
[43:10.420 --> 43:10.980]  Let's see.
[43:11.160 --> 43:11.380]  Okay.
[43:11.620 --> 43:14.400]  I just poured ketchup on some of the fries.
[43:14.820 --> 43:15.460]  Totally fine.
[43:15.840 --> 43:16.220]  Totally fine.
[43:16.220 --> 43:17.840]  I just used that as the...
[43:17.840 --> 43:19.840]  I just dipped the fries into the ketchup.
[43:20.260 --> 43:22.080]  And then, yeah, it ruins a couple of the fries.
[43:22.140 --> 43:23.480]  But I wasn't going to eat all the fries anyway.
[43:23.580 --> 43:24.540]  So what the fuck does that matter?
[43:25.440 --> 43:28.060]  If you do not plan on eating all the fries, totally acceptable.
[43:28.060 --> 43:30.280]  He lost his fucking mind for some reason.
[43:30.440 --> 43:32.040]  I thought you were a lunatic.
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.300]  And I'll tell you why.
[43:33.340 --> 43:35.060]  That's fine if you've got a fork,
[43:35.400 --> 43:37.040]  because you can still eat those normally.
[43:37.920 --> 43:42.660]  But you easily could have eaten four or maybe five or six fries,
[43:42.840 --> 43:44.320]  eaten a little hole for your ketchup.
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.500]  But you just went straight on top.
[43:46.620 --> 43:47.580]  And I thought that was lunacy.
[43:47.920 --> 43:49.000]  Who cares, man?
[43:50.000 --> 43:50.640]  Is that...
[43:50.980 --> 43:51.860]  It's not even a burger.
[43:52.060 --> 43:53.100]  I realize it's not even a burger.
[43:53.280 --> 43:53.760]  That's a BLT.
[43:54.040 --> 43:54.300]  I forgot.
[43:54.440 --> 43:55.280]  I had a BLT that day.
[43:57.020 --> 43:58.080]  Throw my idea out.
[43:58.180 --> 43:59.200]  I'm not doing that with a BLT.
[43:59.400 --> 44:00.720]  Yeah, you would never do that with a BLT.
[44:00.800 --> 44:01.620]  Not in a billion years.
[44:03.380 --> 44:05.500]  I do feel like you could have moved the BLT, though,
[44:05.540 --> 44:07.340]  the rest on the other corner of fries.
[44:07.340 --> 44:09.020]  Well, that's after half of it's gone.
[44:09.140 --> 44:11.000]  The other, you know, this is laid into the meal.
[44:11.140 --> 44:12.860]  I've already eaten most of the BLT at that point.
[44:12.940 --> 44:13.140]  Okay.
[44:13.300 --> 44:14.060]  Was it cut in half?
[44:14.500 --> 44:15.360]  Yeah, of course, man.
[44:15.380 --> 44:15.780]  It's a BLT.
[44:15.860 --> 44:16.300]  They're always cutting.
[44:18.320 --> 44:19.080]  That'd be wild.
[44:19.400 --> 44:22.580]  Having a restaurant that just doesn't cut any of its sandwich.
[44:23.320 --> 44:25.200]  Also, we're looking at half of it,
[44:25.400 --> 44:28.140]  like the idea that you ate it half from that way,
[44:28.200 --> 44:29.960]  that you chose to eat it that way.
[44:30.800 --> 44:32.900]  Face it away from me so everybody can see my bite marks.
[44:35.880 --> 44:37.420]  Anyway, Gavin was disturbed by this,
[44:37.480 --> 44:40.660]  but I didn't even realize that was a controversial thing to do.
[44:41.080 --> 44:42.960]  Yeah, I would be unfazed by it.
[44:43.020 --> 44:43.880]  I wouldn't even notice.
[44:45.020 --> 44:47.200]  Well, I feel like Jason and Nichols thought it was a bit weird.
[44:47.540 --> 44:49.500]  I think they were having fun with you, but I don't know.
[44:49.700 --> 44:49.840]  What did they?
[44:49.920 --> 44:50.580]  Yeah, I was going to say.
[44:50.660 --> 44:51.380]  Now, what does that mean?
[44:51.420 --> 44:52.240]  What did they say?
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.160]  Because I want to know what they said and how they said it.
[44:54.380 --> 44:54.860]  I don't remember.
[44:55.420 --> 44:58.120]  What really all I did was just lean over and take a photo of that.
[44:58.280 --> 44:59.420]  Jeff saw me take a photo.
[44:59.600 --> 45:02.520]  It was like, hey, what's wrong with this?
[45:02.520 --> 45:04.140]  And he just really, really fired up.
[45:04.520 --> 45:05.580]  But really, I was just...
[45:05.580 --> 45:08.700]  Oh, am I on edge around you because of, I don't know,
[45:09.060 --> 45:11.440]  the history of our friendship and relationship together?
[45:11.940 --> 45:12.380]  Crazy.
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.660]  Crazy when I see you nonchalantly smirk to yourself,
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.200]  then pull your phone out and try to take a photo of something of mine without me noticing it.
[45:22.480 --> 45:24.760]  Yeah, my spider sense tingles a bit.
[45:25.340 --> 45:27.700]  I just think ketchup is so gross on fingers.
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.680]  I hate getting it on me.
[45:30.680 --> 45:32.440]  And you're just asking for it with that.
[45:32.700 --> 45:36.140]  The guy that's fingering his balls is worried about ketchup.
[45:36.700 --> 45:39.960]  My balls don't leave like a sticky residue on me.
[45:39.980 --> 45:45.420]  He wants to put his knuckle up his dick too, but he doesn't want to touch wet tomato.
[45:46.040 --> 45:49.000]  Are you asking what would I rather have on my hand?
[45:49.120 --> 45:50.380]  My ball or ketchup?
[45:50.540 --> 45:51.380]  I'd rather have my ball.
[45:51.840 --> 45:52.080]  Ketchup.
[45:52.500 --> 45:53.060]  Yeah, I know.
[45:53.340 --> 45:55.600]  We know how you feel, Gavin.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.560]  You don't wash your hands.
[45:56.640 --> 45:57.040]  It's fine.
[45:57.040 --> 46:01.620]  I don't get a sticky residue from my own balls.
[46:02.280 --> 46:03.940]  You're doing something wrong, then.
[46:07.780 --> 46:09.420]  Oh, I walked into that.
[46:13.520 --> 46:15.820]  You would have just eaten some fries? Is that what you're saying?
[46:16.420 --> 46:17.840]  You would have made a space? You would have burrowed?
[46:17.900 --> 46:20.900]  Yeah, I would have just eaten a hole or made a little mound.
[46:22.140 --> 46:24.860]  I'm always going to put ketchup on something, but not the food.
[46:24.860 --> 46:28.880]  I have a dumb question that you just made me think of that I saved for the show.
[46:29.220 --> 46:32.980]  These are things that I know are dumb, and I just want to ask here,
[46:33.260 --> 46:34.540]  because I just had never considered them.
[46:35.180 --> 46:38.640]  Do beavers eat wood or do they just gnaw on it?
[46:39.940 --> 46:41.660]  Like, do they actually eat wood?
[46:41.960 --> 46:44.020]  I don't know what beavers eat.
[46:44.200 --> 46:47.420]  I assume that they eat wood, but I don't...
[46:48.060 --> 46:51.060]  I think they eat other beavers. I think they're cannibalistic.
[46:51.440 --> 46:51.840]  Really?
[46:52.300 --> 46:53.320]  Yeah, I think so.
[46:53.320 --> 46:55.240]  There's no way they're cannibalistic.
[46:55.240 --> 46:55.960]  Oh my god.
[46:57.100 --> 47:00.520]  Even if they are, this doesn't mean that another beaver is its diet.
[47:00.700 --> 47:03.340]  There's nothing surely that only eats its own kind.
[47:04.740 --> 47:05.380]  I don't know.
[47:07.860 --> 47:10.680]  Oh, it says they don't eat each other. Maybe they don't then.
[47:11.100 --> 47:11.280]  Okay.
[47:12.100 --> 47:16.520]  You're just spreading beaver lies on this podcast.
[47:16.940 --> 47:19.400]  I like also that you didn't google what the beavers eat.
[47:19.480 --> 47:21.060]  You just googled do beavers eat beavers.
[47:21.060 --> 47:24.680]  I saw a clip of a beaver gnawing down a tree, and I thought,
[47:24.800 --> 47:27.420]  do they actually eat it or are they cucking their mouth?
[47:27.580 --> 47:28.660]  Like I was talking about before.
[47:28.680 --> 47:30.660]  Are they? I'm sorry. Are they what?
[47:30.920 --> 47:32.820]  They're cucking their stomach. A stomach cuck.
[47:33.060 --> 47:34.920]  Or they're biting into it and not eating it.
[47:35.340 --> 47:37.500]  So you think a beaver mouth cucks its stomach?
[47:37.980 --> 47:40.260]  Is that what you think chewing gum is?
[47:41.020 --> 47:43.380]  Well, that was... we talked about that. That was a joke from...
[47:44.420 --> 47:45.720]  What show, Jeff?
[47:47.700 --> 47:49.400]  Kimmy Schmidt. Season 3 of Kimmy Schmidt.
[47:49.400 --> 47:52.040]  Gum is a lie. Your mouth tells your stomach.
[47:52.240 --> 47:56.080]  But I said recently we were talking about taste buds on the fingers
[47:56.080 --> 47:59.100]  that I wouldn't like it because I'd feel like I was cucking my stomach
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.680]  because I was just tasting everything and not eating.
[48:02.240 --> 48:03.580]  And that's what I meant by that.
[48:03.680 --> 48:06.160]  I was wondering if a beaver was a stomach cuck, but I said mouth.
[48:06.440 --> 48:12.100]  Can we collab with a gum company and just make a gum called cuck?
[48:12.520 --> 48:15.660]  Like the regulation gum just tastes like somebody else's dick.
[48:16.100 --> 48:17.900]  You think my mom knows what cuck is?
[48:18.660 --> 48:19.860]  Oh, my God.
[48:20.020 --> 48:21.660]  Dude, this episode is insane.
[48:21.820 --> 48:23.300]  I'm down to like a 6.2.
[48:23.480 --> 48:25.000]  This is insane.
[48:25.560 --> 48:26.760]  I mean, she's going to listen to this.
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.140]  And we had the whole butt plug thing.
[48:28.260 --> 48:29.520]  I don't know. I would be...
[48:29.520 --> 48:31.500]  I don't think my mom knows what cucking is.
[48:32.180 --> 48:34.040]  No, it sounds like you need to find out.
[48:34.280 --> 48:35.200]  I'll find out in a few weeks.
[48:35.640 --> 48:36.760]  Is she good at nature?
[48:37.700 --> 48:39.300]  Is she good at nature?
[48:39.480 --> 48:40.540]  Does she know about animals?
[48:40.600 --> 48:41.780]  She's a fucking Pokemon?
[48:42.020 --> 48:42.660]  Like, what do you mean?
[48:44.780 --> 48:46.220]  No, she's fire based.
[48:46.780 --> 48:49.140]  Does she care about animals?
[48:49.720 --> 48:50.900]  She cares about the planet.
[48:51.200 --> 48:52.360]  Does she recycle?
[48:52.540 --> 48:53.620]  Yes, she recycles.
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.680]  So maybe she would know about like cuckoos and all that.
[48:57.200 --> 48:58.400]  About cuckoos?
[48:58.980 --> 48:59.660]  From Zelda?
[49:00.200 --> 49:07.200]  No, isn't it coming from where the cuckoo bird like puts one of its eggs in the other nest?
[49:07.200 --> 49:10.120]  This man's coming with the word origin of cuck.
[49:10.480 --> 49:12.640]  Yeah, he's going to the origin.
[49:12.960 --> 49:14.360]  That's what those birds do.
[49:14.360 --> 49:18.760]  I don't know if that's where the word came from or if it's something that you made up.
[49:18.940 --> 49:20.060]  It makes sense though.
[49:20.060 --> 49:21.980]  I also don't know anything about the birds.
[49:22.300 --> 49:25.160]  I'm definitely not going to Google it if that helps.
[49:25.400 --> 49:32.060]  The birds like the birds will lay an egg in a different bird's nest and they'll replace
[49:32.060 --> 49:35.600]  one of its eggs with their own egg and then it gets another bird to raise its young.
[49:36.240 --> 49:37.900]  Yeah, I feel like that was an episode of The Simpsons.
[49:39.420 --> 49:43.780]  Andrew mentioning the food cucking reminds me I wanted to tell you guys I did buy tongue
[49:43.780 --> 49:44.860]  sleeves for us.
[49:45.100 --> 49:46.240]  You have tongue sleeves?
[49:46.320 --> 49:46.840]  Did you really?
[49:46.980 --> 49:48.180]  I don't have them yet.
[49:48.540 --> 49:52.940]  They're going to be a while, but I did some research and I Googled around and I found
[49:52.940 --> 49:56.620]  what I think are the best option for tongue sleeve, but we're not going to have them for a while.
[49:57.340 --> 50:04.040]  Nick copied and pasted the definition for cuckold and Shelby has to look at this later
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.920]  and I don't wish this on anyone.
[50:06.400 --> 50:07.020]  This is terrible.
[50:08.280 --> 50:09.940]  It's just Jeff with like...
[50:09.940 --> 50:14.480]  Here's the thing, you copied and pasted it next to Jeff with a BLT?
[50:15.760 --> 50:17.700]  In what way are these related?
[50:18.520 --> 50:19.460]  Someone ate his sandwich.
[50:21.320 --> 50:22.200]  God damn.
[50:25.340 --> 50:28.220]  Yeah, so if you just text your mom, what is cuck?
[50:28.540 --> 50:29.380]  Do you think that'd be a...
[50:29.760 --> 50:31.880]  God, this sucks. 5.4.
[50:32.580 --> 50:32.920]  Okay.
[50:33.200 --> 50:33.980]  Try if you want.
[50:34.500 --> 50:35.980]  I don't want it to come from me, actually.
[50:36.120 --> 50:37.240]  You're the one suggesting it.
[50:38.740 --> 50:41.340]  Well, I don't understand what you just said.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.640]  Do you want me to send this text or no?
[50:43.980 --> 50:46.820]  No, I wanted to know what you were going to text her to ask her.
[50:47.180 --> 50:48.340]  I wasn't going to text her anything.
[50:48.440 --> 50:49.780]  I was going to let her listen to the show.
[50:51.140 --> 50:52.560]  But do you want me to text?
[50:52.860 --> 50:53.560]  I don't care.
[50:53.660 --> 50:54.120]  I will.
[50:54.900 --> 50:55.540]  I have my phone.
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.280]  You sound very angry.
[50:57.700 --> 50:59.100]  Does she have notifications on?
[50:59.100 --> 50:59.820]  He's being ridiculous.
[51:01.120 --> 51:02.220]  Let's take it down a notch.
[51:02.440 --> 51:02.880]  Yeah, you're right.
[51:02.960 --> 51:03.260]  I need to.
[51:03.640 --> 51:04.520]  You're right, but he's being crazy.
[51:04.780 --> 51:05.280]  He's being insane.
[51:05.280 --> 51:06.560]  I'm still processing.
[51:07.060 --> 51:11.500]  The way he asked if my mom knew about birds was by saying that she liked nature.
[51:12.500 --> 51:13.220]  I'm sorry.
[51:13.560 --> 51:15.040]  I'm hung up on previous things.
[51:16.060 --> 51:17.000]  That's, you know, that's fair.
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.040]  What would you like me to do, Gavin?
[51:18.940 --> 51:20.120]  I would do whatever you want.
[51:20.200 --> 51:22.420]  I don't want to get involved with you and your mom.
[51:22.520 --> 51:23.880]  You know her better than I do.
[51:24.900 --> 51:27.700]  If you want to ask her today, if you want to just let her listen to it.
[51:28.680 --> 51:29.560]  I'm fascinated, though.
[51:29.820 --> 51:30.520]  I wonder what she would say.
[51:30.520 --> 51:31.180]  What's the phrasing?
[51:31.280 --> 51:32.520]  What was the phrasing you just gave?
[51:33.000 --> 51:34.440]  Don't ever use my phrasing for anything.
[51:34.440 --> 51:37.020]  Do you know about nature?
[51:37.700 --> 51:37.900]  Yeah.
[51:38.500 --> 51:39.340]  Do you know about nature?
[51:41.780 --> 51:44.160]  Is she good at nature is what Gavin asked.
[51:45.260 --> 51:46.440]  Hey, mom, what's up?
[51:46.440 --> 51:47.220]  Are you good at nature?
[51:48.860 --> 51:50.120]  Do you know what?
[51:55.680 --> 51:59.360]  Like if I were playing Jeopardy and the category was good at nature,
[51:59.360 --> 52:01.860]  I wouldn't expect five questions about birds.
[52:05.800 --> 52:06.480]  What do you think of?
[52:06.480 --> 52:07.320]  What do you think of nature?
[52:08.320 --> 52:08.680]  Grass?
[52:09.640 --> 52:11.920]  I think of poison ivy, as dumb as that is.
[52:12.940 --> 52:13.300]  What?
[52:15.200 --> 52:17.980]  If you're good at nature, you're here.
[52:18.120 --> 52:19.780]  You're like controlling weeds.
[52:20.600 --> 52:23.160]  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say nature, Gavin?
[52:25.240 --> 52:31.220]  To be honest, it's like the Trivial Pursuit, like science image, the frog and the leaf.
[52:31.820 --> 52:32.940]  OK, how about you, Eric?
[52:34.840 --> 52:37.640]  Trees, forest, like a creek.
[52:38.200 --> 52:38.980]  That's it.
[52:40.340 --> 52:41.340]  Definitely trees.
[52:41.940 --> 52:44.120]  I think of one tree, like an oak tree.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.320]  Oh, can I actually change my answer?
[52:46.480 --> 52:47.800]  I think of like a hot wife.
[52:48.320 --> 52:50.420]  And it's just a guy sitting in the corner watching.
[52:50.780 --> 52:51.420]  That's nature.
[52:55.820 --> 52:57.200]  I think of Jeff Sandler.
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.920]  Hey, what do you guys know about rare fruit?
[53:03.800 --> 53:06.160]  This is the craziest.
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.020]  This episode is nuts.
[53:10.660 --> 53:14.000]  I'm just imagining somebody looking through their window feeling.
[53:14.320 --> 53:15.500]  Yeah, plant that tree.
[53:20.140 --> 53:22.340]  Yeah, you put that bush in.
[53:26.600 --> 53:27.800]  It's surely not.
[53:28.300 --> 53:32.520]  Cuck, if you're like just perving from a distance, you gotta be there on a chair.
[53:32.520 --> 53:33.180]  Watch it.
[53:33.300 --> 53:37.020]  If you hire landscapers, are you cucking?
[53:37.460 --> 53:43.200]  You hire landscapers and then pull like your recliner out to the front yard and watch.
[53:49.220 --> 53:57.140]  Oh, he's planting a rare bush.
[53:59.660 --> 54:02.320]  So, Jeff, tell us about rare fruit.
[54:02.520 --> 54:06.520]  I was just thinking we should get into rare fruit.
[54:06.840 --> 54:08.120]  Oh, like what, Jeff?
[54:08.320 --> 54:08.900]  Like, look at that.
[54:09.000 --> 54:10.040]  That looks so cool.
[54:10.160 --> 54:10.640]  What is that?
[54:10.840 --> 54:12.240]  That's called a hollow fruit.
[54:12.640 --> 54:15.120]  And it's supposedly it tastes like sugar cane.
[54:15.220 --> 54:17.140]  I saw it on Reddit the other day and that got me thinking.
[54:17.520 --> 54:18.600]  I'd never heard about that.
[54:18.740 --> 54:22.540]  And 49 years of living and I've done some serious living.
[54:22.860 --> 54:24.300]  I've never heard of a hollow fruit.
[54:24.360 --> 54:27.880]  I've never seen anything that looks like a planet explode before that tastes like sugar.
[54:27.980 --> 54:29.560]  I want some of that immediately.
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.000]  And then I got me thinking there's a there's a lot about fruit we don't know.
[54:33.100 --> 54:36.620]  There's a lot of rare boutique fruits out there we may not be familiar with.
[54:37.100 --> 54:39.740]  We're all we're all caught up in in hot dogs.
[54:39.900 --> 54:43.780]  But maybe maybe there's some rare fruits that we might want to try to experience.
[54:44.060 --> 54:46.640]  I feel like I've seen James Bond defuse that.
[54:47.180 --> 54:48.720]  Yeah, I was going to say that fruit.
[54:48.840 --> 54:51.680]  I feel like I would turn into one of those aliens from Annihilation.
[54:52.180 --> 54:54.360]  It looks like something that came out of the shimmer.
[54:54.780 --> 54:56.540]  It looks like it's blowing up.
[54:56.620 --> 54:59.000]  Which which bit do you eat of that hollow fruit?
[54:59.560 --> 55:02.660]  I want to find out because the top part looks like broccoli.
[55:02.800 --> 55:06.360]  And then the inside looks like a sort of like a jawbreaker, I guess.
[55:06.760 --> 55:13.020]  Yeah, it looks like broccoli that transitions to a carrot into a into a jawbreaker.
[55:13.380 --> 55:14.740]  Yeah, it looks amazing.
[55:14.840 --> 55:18.260]  But then I got me thinking, like, there's a there's probably a lot of rare fruits out there.
[55:18.320 --> 55:18.940]  You know what I mean?
[55:19.460 --> 55:24.540]  Like not every not your pedestrian everyday fruit fruits, fruits that you and I, you guys,
[55:24.700 --> 55:26.320]  we don't even know exist out there.
[55:26.320 --> 55:30.280]  There's fruits that we've never heard of that are delighting people that are in the know.
[55:30.360 --> 55:31.240]  And we're not those people.
[55:31.280 --> 55:33.520]  And I want to be those people.
[55:33.740 --> 55:36.620]  Do you mean rare like there's not a lot of the plants or like that?
[55:36.620 --> 55:37.780]  You just don't see them in America.
[55:38.100 --> 55:38.620]  Yeah, both.
[55:38.720 --> 55:39.860]  Like there's not a lot of them.
[55:39.940 --> 55:40.560]  I mean, rare.
[55:40.780 --> 55:42.580]  I mean, that's the definition of rare.
[55:42.940 --> 55:44.640]  But it fits both of those things you just said.
[55:44.780 --> 55:49.200]  And so, yeah, fruits that you don't that you don't have easy access to.
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.380]  Fruits that like like maybe someday we could even go on a journey to a fruit.
[55:54.380 --> 55:56.960]  Like maybe there's a fruit that only grows on a mountain somewhere.
[55:57.100 --> 55:59.840]  And we got to go to it to get to that fruit so that we can taste
[56:00.520 --> 56:03.560]  that little bit of joy that no one else on Earth gets to taste.
[56:03.700 --> 56:07.580]  I want to be I want to be just like a fruit explorer.
[56:08.380 --> 56:10.480]  I want to be like Lewis and Fruit Clark.
[56:14.100 --> 56:16.700]  Have you ever had that stink fruit?
[56:16.820 --> 56:17.220]  What's it called?
[56:17.300 --> 56:18.580]  The one that's durian fruit?
[56:18.720 --> 56:19.540]  Yeah. Have you ever tried that?
[56:19.780 --> 56:20.660]  No, I never have.
[56:20.780 --> 56:21.400]  I'd love to.
[56:21.540 --> 56:22.060]  I'd love to.
[56:22.140 --> 56:22.600]  Maybe we should.
[56:22.960 --> 56:24.660]  I want to expand my fruit horizons.
[56:24.740 --> 56:25.780]  I think we all should.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.140]  Yeah.
[56:26.380 --> 56:30.980]  And if Gavin wants to get off in some cuckish way doing it, that's fine with me, too.
[56:31.420 --> 56:35.580]  I think the phase one is just going to a grocery store and buying whatever fruit you haven't tried
[56:35.580 --> 56:35.800]  yet.
[56:36.200 --> 56:37.400]  That's a good that's a good start.
[56:37.460 --> 56:37.940]  It's going to be hard.
[56:38.140 --> 56:39.300]  You got to cover your bases.
[56:39.540 --> 56:42.620]  It's going to be hard for me to go to a grocery store in America and find fruit I'm not familiar
[56:42.620 --> 56:44.120]  with, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.940]  I feel like I've probably tried most regular grocery store fruit, right?
[56:48.080 --> 56:48.400]  Oh, you know what?
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.560]  You've never seen a durian just in your grocery store?
[56:50.980 --> 56:51.440]  You know what?
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.140]  I probably have.
[56:52.140 --> 56:52.880]  I probably have.
[56:52.960 --> 56:55.020]  And I've probably seen like an ugly fruit.
[56:55.180 --> 56:56.600]  And there's probably a few out there.
[56:56.800 --> 56:58.500]  We could go to like a Whole Foods.
[56:58.820 --> 57:01.280]  We could go to like maybe an Asian market.
[57:01.360 --> 57:03.560]  Oh, go to like Fiesta and see if there's some stuff.
[57:03.580 --> 57:03.960]  Go to Fiesta.
[57:04.240 --> 57:04.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:05.200 --> 57:06.780]  I bet we could assemble a group of fruits.
[57:06.880 --> 57:11.080]  We've we've never maybe that'd be the next time we get together to do live action recording.
[57:11.300 --> 57:14.560]  Maybe we'll assemble a rare fruit tray.
[57:14.660 --> 57:20.120]  Maybe if we're all in all in Fiesta and we find a fruit that none of us have ever tried,
[57:20.120 --> 57:21.280]  then we have to get it.
[57:21.360 --> 57:22.740]  And we just go around the fruits buying.
[57:22.780 --> 57:23.200]  Oh boy.
[57:23.980 --> 57:25.880]  We're buying one of everything we've never tried.
[57:26.420 --> 57:26.780]  I really like this idea.
[57:26.780 --> 57:27.200]  It's a great idea.
[57:28.000 --> 57:28.480]  Yeah.
[57:28.980 --> 57:30.220]  I got a reply from my mom.
[57:31.060 --> 57:31.540]  No.
[57:32.320 --> 57:33.080]  What did you ask her?
[57:33.520 --> 57:34.500]  Do you know what cuck is?
[57:35.980 --> 57:36.860]  This is the reply.
[57:37.560 --> 57:37.880]  Sucks.
[57:39.020 --> 57:41.980]  Cuck is a weak or servile man.
[57:42.520 --> 57:48.740]  Often used as a contemptuous term for a man with moderate or progressive political views.
[57:50.180 --> 57:51.500]  Did she Google this?
[57:52.000 --> 57:53.400]  That was my next text.
[57:53.880 --> 57:54.120]  Yep.
[57:54.780 --> 57:56.060]  Don't ever reply to that.
[57:56.260 --> 57:57.840]  But it's a sex.
[57:57.960 --> 57:58.940]  No, not not.
[57:59.060 --> 58:00.160]  I don't think she's aware of.
[58:00.380 --> 58:01.820]  I think it falls in that category.
[58:02.300 --> 58:02.780]  I think she's.
[58:03.000 --> 58:03.480]  Oh, wait.
[58:03.500 --> 58:05.820]  Can also be used as being sexual unfaithful.
[58:05.980 --> 58:06.720]  I guess.
[58:06.780 --> 58:07.340]  I don't know.
[58:07.520 --> 58:08.480]  I think she's Googling.
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.460]  Cuck is where you're making your mom Google.
[58:14.560 --> 58:15.560]  Oh, boy.
[58:16.860 --> 58:18.480]  I think she misinterpreted.
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.380]  I think she thought I was asking her to give me the definition.
[58:21.580 --> 58:23.260]  So she's not.
[58:23.660 --> 58:24.440]  She's helping you out.
[58:24.620 --> 58:25.820]  Like, yeah, I think she's helping.
[58:26.240 --> 58:27.260]  I just don't.
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.240]  I just I can't imagine that your mom says servile very often.
[58:31.540 --> 58:32.960]  No, that's how it tipped me.
[58:33.480 --> 58:36.920]  I mean, not many people that are good with nature do in my experience.
[58:42.780 --> 58:43.140]  Christ.
[58:44.300 --> 58:45.120]  Oh, man.
[58:46.580 --> 58:48.200]  I'm going to nap after this.
[58:48.320 --> 58:48.360]  Oh, wow.
[58:48.380 --> 58:49.400]  Oh, you got you got more.
[58:49.520 --> 58:50.800]  I was gonna say, should we start wrapping this up?
[58:50.800 --> 58:52.860]  Boy, you got there's more in the chamber.
[58:53.020 --> 58:53.680]  Holy shit.
[58:54.360 --> 58:55.420]  Nah, we should probably wrap it up.
[58:58.260 --> 58:59.380]  Just one question, though.
[58:59.420 --> 59:00.060]  Just one question.
[59:00.240 --> 59:02.060]  OK, you guys were a couple weeks ago.
[59:02.180 --> 59:04.080]  This is something that's been itching at my brain for a while.
[59:04.180 --> 59:05.340]  I've been meaning to get out to you guys.
[59:05.420 --> 59:08.820]  You remember a couple weeks ago we were talking about how Contra 3,
[59:08.960 --> 59:13.160]  I believe it was, was named Super Probiotic Anal War or whatever.
[59:13.460 --> 59:16.480]  Yeah, Super Probiotic Alien Rebels.
[59:17.520 --> 59:19.300]  Super Probiotic Alien War.
[59:19.620 --> 59:23.140]  Yeah, but it was Contra everywhere else in the world.
[59:23.200 --> 59:27.160]  Would it be funny if we changed our name in one territory in the world
[59:27.160 --> 59:28.260]  where we were called something else?
[59:28.280 --> 59:30.480]  Like in Yugoslavia, we're not the regulation podcast.
[59:30.720 --> 59:33.220]  We're Super Probiotic Anal War or whatever.
[59:34.300 --> 59:37.700]  If you're a big fan of regulation podcasts, go to Azerbaijan,
[59:38.400 --> 59:41.960]  where it's like Tomb Enforcer Anarchy Maximum.
[59:42.880 --> 59:45.040]  Where it's like Apple Fart Comedy Troupe.
[59:45.040 --> 59:48.560]  Yeah, we have the ability to see.
[59:49.940 --> 59:52.500]  Because Chartable doesn't exist anymore.
[59:53.540 --> 59:56.460]  Is there a do we have a version of Chartable we have access to?
[59:56.660 --> 59:58.140]  Like within the numbers?
[59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.480]  Do we have that like our demographics other than YouTube?
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.920]  Because we can look at YouTube like we get our demographics from YouTube.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.900]  And I guess that would be a thing.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.300]  Yeah. How many how many people from Yugoslavia?
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.600]  Well, that's the I was going to say there is a time where we were like
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.840]  number one in like Egypt.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.300]  And it was just clearly like, according to Chartable,
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.840]  we're like the number two comedy thing.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.040]  And it's like, well, you see, that's possible, though, because Egypt is a country.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.440]  Yeah, I was going to say, why do we keep using Yugoslavia as a standpoint?
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.140]  It hasn't been a country since the 90s.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.080]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.060]  Funnier.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:40.120]  What I'm trying to get at is we should find if there is any a place that is incredibly
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.740]  I was going to say obscure, but I don't even know how you necessarily measure that
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.020]  a place where we're number one, which I assume is a territory that doesn't have
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.080]  a lot of anything that is being streamed.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.080]  And that person should be able to rename whatever it is in that territory.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.400]  We give them the right to the name.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.120]  I see what you're saying.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.320]  So we need to find the place and then we need to have that person
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.640]  verify that they are the person listening,
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.320]  putting us in the position because I assume nobody's streaming.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.400]  The only way we're number one in any region is if no one else is doing any downloading
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.600]  a podcast, but this person.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:21.180]  Yeah, we need to find one person who listens to us on the Seychelles Islands or something.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.520]  Hey, Germany, almost 3000 downloads.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.380]  Way to go, boys.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.200]  Oh, pretty good.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.800]  But is that one person downloading it 3000 times?
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  Probably not.
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.080]  We got to get we have to get a little more granular, I suppose.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.020]  We have a lot of places that have just one download.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:38.400]  Really?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.480]  Faroe Islands, Nigeria, Tunisia.
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.240]  We could go to Turks and Caicos.
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.480]  If you're in the Faroe Islands and you're listening to this, will you reach out?
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.360]  If you reside in the Faroe Islands or Turks and Caicos as a backup,
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.000]  please reach out to us and let us know.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.260]  We'd like to let you rename our podcast in your territory.
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.860]  Oh, yeah, only where you are.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.520]  Do you think that's what it is?
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.860]  Or is one guy just VPN hopping every week from a different place?
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:10.900]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.980]  Who fucking VPNs from the Faroe Islands?
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.120]  The Netflix library is crazy.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.660]  Honestly, if you VPN to the Faroe Islands, you're easier to find, period.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.540]  My mom just texted me the first use of cuck was in 1611.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.500]  Okay, okay.
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.320]  All right, we got to cut it off.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.580]  We got it. We got to wrap this up.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.240]  This is a mess.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.180]  Hey, thanks for listening to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.340]  This was episode 41.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.260]  This is probably our 250th episode or so.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.080]  Who can even fucking tell at this point?
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:46.660]  Wow.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.040]  Can you believe that the Gerplers came out?
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.100]  Gerpeltine's day was a huge, unmitigated success with zero issues or failures.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.400]  And literally every single person on the planet Earth that wanted a Gerpler got one,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.600]  as well as both signs.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:00.640]  That was awesome.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.280]  We can't wait to do that again,
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.260]  especially given how everyone was so happy.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.180]  And we're just so happy that you spent another hour of your day listening to us
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.280]  fight about absolutely nothing.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.900]  And we hope you'll come back next week,
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.500]  kind of like a cuck, and listen to this podcast again.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.260]  We'll see ya.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.440]  What?
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:20.420]  What?
