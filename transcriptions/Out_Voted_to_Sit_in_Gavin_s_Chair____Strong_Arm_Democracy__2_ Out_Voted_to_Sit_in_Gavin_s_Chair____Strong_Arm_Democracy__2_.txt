[00:21.140 --> 00:23.160]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[00:24.760 --> 00:30.640]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:31.240 --> 00:35.200]  This is number two under the current name.
[00:35.560 --> 00:37.700]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton,
[00:38.220 --> 00:40.520]  Gavin Free, Eric and Nick, somewhere in the background.
[00:41.100 --> 00:42.220]  And take it away, Gavin.
[00:42.560 --> 00:46.320]  I like that Eric typically types in the Discord as you're doing the intro,
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.760]  the episode number, because, you know, it's historically been like 192 or whatever.
[00:50.760 --> 00:54.060]  He wrote episode two. I feel like we could have figured that out.
[00:54.300 --> 00:59.060]  No, I agree. I agree. But I figure, you know, we have a good thing going,
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.600]  and I feel good about letting you know through this chat.
[01:03.380 --> 01:05.180]  Nick is right. Why risk it?
[01:05.260 --> 01:08.420]  It helps me because when I go back in a week to do the thumbnail,
[01:08.660 --> 01:10.280]  it's hard to figure out where the episode started.
[01:10.560 --> 01:13.600]  Because usually there's just a bunch of nonsense.
[01:13.980 --> 01:17.300]  And sometimes there have been multiple occasions where I've put photos up
[01:17.300 --> 01:19.840]  in the episode dump that weren't a part of the episode.
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.660]  They were just shit we were talking about before or after.
[01:21.780 --> 01:22.580]  It confuses the audience.
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.840]  I really need the episode two marker. Thank you.
[01:25.900 --> 01:28.240]  But I will say, Gavin, I totally agree.
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.200]  And if this was somebody else doing it,
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.800]  I would have been all over them for saying episode two as well.
[01:34.120 --> 01:37.200]  I feel like Regulation Podcast is going pretty well so far.
[01:37.580 --> 01:38.340]  Amazing start.
[01:38.800 --> 01:41.380]  Thank you so much to all the people that have supported us via Patreon.
[01:41.920 --> 01:44.160]  There's been an unbelievable amount of support.
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.460]  It has been wonderful and overwhelming in a very amazing way.
[01:51.400 --> 01:52.740]  Apparently not to everybody else.
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.260]  Nobody else agrees. Jesus fucking Christ.
[01:55.700 --> 01:57.400]  What's wrong with all of you?
[01:57.700 --> 01:59.760]  Really thought that Geoff would start saying something.
[01:59.940 --> 02:01.320]  I just couldn't believe he didn't.
[02:01.880 --> 02:04.180]  Oh, really? No, I was expecting Eric to say something.
[02:04.440 --> 02:06.240]  Oh, yeah, I was waiting for Eric.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.160]  Just any of you. If any of you could have said something.
[02:08.160 --> 02:08.920]  I mean, I'm muted.
[02:09.040 --> 02:11.860]  You can see very clearly that I'm muted when I'm not talking.
[02:12.200 --> 02:14.220]  I mean, technically, we do everything in ANEG.
[02:14.420 --> 02:15.660]  So it was like Andrew spoke.
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.440]  It should have been, he should have thrown to Nick and then Eric.
[02:18.560 --> 02:19.280]  And then it was my turn.
[02:19.280 --> 02:21.060]  Okay, then we'll do it. All right, then go ahead, Nick.
[02:21.480 --> 02:23.440]  I'm blown away. Thank you for all the support.
[02:23.520 --> 02:26.100]  The love that you've given us and following our Patreon.
[02:26.320 --> 02:28.260]  And if not, our new YouTube page as well.
[02:29.260 --> 02:35.840]  Great. Hey, guys, I want to say I'm sorry for the rocky start we had as a regulation podcast.
[02:36.160 --> 02:39.060]  I apologize for the confusion that came through,
[02:39.220 --> 02:42.640]  telling you to download the episodes, which I never should have done, clearly.
[02:43.780 --> 02:46.160]  I apologize for any confusion that caused.
[02:46.160 --> 02:49.380]  But I do want to say I am overwhelmed by your support.
[02:49.380 --> 02:54.820]  And I want to thank you for following us as difficult as it was to find these episodes.
[02:54.960 --> 02:56.060]  Thank you very, very much.
[02:56.100 --> 02:57.700]  So wait, they shouldn't download it?
[02:58.020 --> 02:59.560]  I just shouldn't have said anything.
[02:59.860 --> 03:02.880]  I didn't find it to be confusing when I said download the episode.
[03:02.980 --> 03:03.520]  It helps us.
[03:03.680 --> 03:05.860]  And then people went, what if I download it on YouTube?
[03:05.880 --> 03:07.960]  And I just went, this is we're already.
[03:08.960 --> 03:10.540]  This is we're gone. We're beyond.
[03:10.740 --> 03:11.960]  They're like, what if I pirate it?
[03:11.980 --> 03:14.240]  And it's like, what are you talking about?
[03:14.580 --> 03:15.280]  This is insane.
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.280]  So I just shouldn't have said anything.
[03:17.540 --> 03:20.680]  I apologize for the rocky start with where we had to upload and everything.
[03:20.860 --> 03:22.920]  But hopefully by this point, we have it all sorted out.
[03:23.000 --> 03:24.060]  You guys are following where you can.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.380]  And we appreciate your support.
[03:26.260 --> 03:27.060]  Hey, y'all.
[03:27.300 --> 03:29.500]  It's your boy, Lil Jeffy here.
[03:29.740 --> 03:34.300]  And I just wanted to reiterate what my co-workers and friends have said.
[03:34.820 --> 03:36.560]  What an amazing show of support.
[03:36.700 --> 03:38.020]  Boy, does it mean the world to us.
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.120]  If I could explain it in such a way.
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.900]  It's like you as a community have given my heart, my very heart,
[03:47.040 --> 03:50.420]  the biggest throbbing boner a heart has ever had.
[03:50.780 --> 03:52.220]  I feel like I'm just...
[03:52.220 --> 03:59.380]  My heart is just pumping love and blood and like, just like good feelings and jizz.
[03:59.500 --> 04:04.940]  And I just, I feel like I'm going to explode with cheer, if at all possible.
[04:05.400 --> 04:09.460]  So thank you so much for my heart boner and for all of the support.
[04:10.020 --> 04:10.960]  Gavin, I believe it's your turn.
[04:12.280 --> 04:13.980]  I hate this bit so much.
[04:15.060 --> 04:17.400]  But everything should be in place now, right?
[04:17.580 --> 04:19.440]  We've acquired some things.
[04:20.000 --> 04:20.400]  Hopefully.
[04:20.680 --> 04:20.880]  Have we?
[04:20.980 --> 04:23.860]  I mean, we've said yes.
[04:24.740 --> 04:25.500]  You got paperwork?
[04:26.160 --> 04:26.620]  Yeah, right.
[04:27.080 --> 04:28.080]  I'm all done with the paperwork.
[04:28.500 --> 04:29.980]  But that's not the end of all of this.
[04:30.120 --> 04:32.680]  And we're in the middle of just waiting to hear back on some stuff.
[04:32.720 --> 04:34.100]  And then we'll be able to turn everything over.
[04:34.580 --> 04:36.140]  We might be getting our bleep back.
[04:36.680 --> 04:37.740]  Oh my god.
[04:38.100 --> 04:38.660]  We'll see.
[04:38.700 --> 04:39.660]  Let's wait and see.
[04:39.860 --> 04:40.660]  Let's wait and see.
[04:40.660 --> 04:42.280]  I don't want to risk it.
[04:42.340 --> 04:45.780]  I wouldn't even throw it out there that whether or not the bleep is here or not.
[04:45.860 --> 04:47.000]  I feel like he said it.
[04:47.120 --> 04:47.700]  We might.
[04:47.840 --> 04:49.300]  Well, I mean, we own it.
[04:49.740 --> 04:50.940]  I mean, it's paid for.
[04:51.300 --> 04:52.040]  Yes, exactly.
[04:52.340 --> 04:56.140]  So that's, but like, you know, the actual ownership and reversion.
[04:56.280 --> 04:57.100]  I just wouldn't test it.
[04:57.160 --> 04:58.620]  I just wouldn't say the old name.
[04:58.680 --> 05:01.980]  Well, the thing that we, well, Gavin, you bought, we bought a thing.
[05:02.460 --> 05:02.680]  Yeah.
[05:02.740 --> 05:02.960]  Right?
[05:03.220 --> 05:05.220]  And now we own a thing, in theory.
[05:05.440 --> 05:07.620]  I don't know why we can't talk about the thing we own.
[05:08.100 --> 05:08.580]  I don't know.
[05:09.620 --> 05:11.780]  Is it a zoo? Nick asked if it's a zoo.
[05:11.920 --> 05:12.700]  We bought a zoo.
[05:13.160 --> 05:15.600]  Technically speaking, you're Eric's boss at the moment, Gavin.
[05:16.680 --> 05:18.320]  We're in a transitional phase.
[05:19.660 --> 05:21.660]  Oh, I like this.
[05:21.760 --> 05:23.040]  Eric, when do you want your review to be?
[05:24.460 --> 05:26.100]  I would say this time next year.
[05:26.720 --> 05:27.120]  Okay.
[05:27.280 --> 05:28.060]  Let me write that down.
[05:29.500 --> 05:30.360]  You got it.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.600]  Set alarm for one year from now.
[05:32.880 --> 05:36.220]  It's just funny because as of today, it's still a little murky.
[05:36.220 --> 05:39.540]  But by the time this episode comes out, it will be 100% done.
[05:39.740 --> 05:40.860]  That's why I was bringing it up.
[05:41.020 --> 05:41.740]  I know. I know.
[05:41.740 --> 05:42.860]  I know that's why you're bringing it up.
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.500]  I think Eric is worried it won't be.
[05:44.860 --> 05:47.100]  The hilarious thing is we're doing a twofer today.
[05:47.220 --> 05:49.900]  So we're going to immediately roll into episode three right after this.
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.020]  And we still won't be able to talk about it.
[05:52.100 --> 05:53.760]  Oh, it is definitely gonna be done there.
[05:54.060 --> 05:54.300]  Yeah.
[05:54.840 --> 05:59.560]  Before we move on, I need to just take the show hostage for a minute because I keep putting
[05:59.560 --> 06:00.340]  something off.
[06:00.560 --> 06:01.940]  I keep delaying this.
[06:02.420 --> 06:06.900]  I'm still using my old chair because I keep waiting to do a thing where I sit in the chair
[06:06.900 --> 06:07.720]  for the first time.
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.160]  Oh, yeah.
[06:08.220 --> 06:09.020]  And it never comes.
[06:10.400 --> 06:11.160]  I've been waiting.
[06:11.600 --> 06:13.180]  You could have done it last week.
[06:13.500 --> 06:15.180]  I know, but it never came up.
[06:15.260 --> 06:16.760]  I never found a way to interject it.
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.240]  It doesn't matter.
[06:17.500 --> 06:17.980]  It doesn't matter.
[06:18.040 --> 06:18.960]  Just let him do the chair thing.
[06:19.020 --> 06:20.660]  So do you want to do it right now?
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.500]  I'm standing up.
[06:22.660 --> 06:24.940]  I'm about to sit in my new Herman Miller.
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.540]  I've been waiting months.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.940]  It doesn't make sense to do it like four minutes in.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.800]  Why wouldn't you wait until the end of the episode to be like a big granddad?
[06:31.800 --> 06:33.820]  Because I want to sit in the chair.
[06:33.980 --> 06:35.840]  I'm so sick of this broken...
[06:35.840 --> 06:37.980]  It's just weird to do it mid-episode, dude.
[06:38.060 --> 06:41.800]  What if you start the next episode in the new chair and we'll see if it's better?
[06:42.480 --> 06:43.940]  Oh, we can compare the performances.
[06:44.100 --> 06:45.860]  Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
[06:45.900 --> 06:46.900]  I agree with that also.
[06:47.020 --> 06:47.160]  Yeah.
[06:47.640 --> 06:48.200]  Hang on.
[06:48.540 --> 06:48.860]  Hang on.
[06:49.520 --> 06:52.900]  Now, we are all co-owners of this company, and I think we can take a vote.
[06:53.900 --> 06:55.300]  I vote for next episode.
[06:55.740 --> 06:57.080]  I also vote for next episode.
[06:57.140 --> 06:57.520]  Next episode.
[06:57.960 --> 06:59.480]  I vote for this episode.
[06:59.900 --> 07:00.720]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[07:00.720 --> 07:03.880]  Unfortunately, Andrew and Gavin, you are out-voting.
[07:04.020 --> 07:05.140]  Andrew, I did what I could.
[07:05.720 --> 07:07.520]  Majority rule is not to be determined.
[07:07.980 --> 07:08.940]  That's such a lie.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.360]  What do you mean? No, I didn't.
[07:10.700 --> 07:13.040]  You put this in motion.
[07:14.040 --> 07:14.640]  Oh, yeah.
[07:14.820 --> 07:15.380]  You kicked the ball.
[07:15.860 --> 07:21.040]  Does anybody think that it's gonna be like a reverse Icy Hot on the Balls situation
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.280]  where Andrew ceases to be as funny because he's too comfortable?
[07:24.680 --> 07:25.740]  Oh, he'll fall asleep.
[07:26.200 --> 07:29.380]  Like maybe we'll have to put thumbtacks in the bottom of the chair or something
[07:29.380 --> 07:31.480]  just to agitate you a little bit to keep you alert.
[07:32.040 --> 07:33.360]  Oh, I'm plenty agitated.
[07:33.520 --> 07:34.880]  You don't need to put in the thumbtacks.
[07:35.080 --> 07:35.660]  I'm annoyed.
[07:36.180 --> 07:39.920]  You know, I think technically, was that given to you under the previous podcast, that chair?
[07:40.480 --> 07:40.860]  Yeah.
[07:41.180 --> 07:41.820]  Yeah, I guess it was.
[07:41.820 --> 07:43.900]  I think technically, currently, that's my chair.
[07:44.180 --> 07:46.240]  I think Gavin owns that chair.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.640]  Yeah, that's pretty...
[07:47.640 --> 07:49.300]  I believe Gavin bought your chair.
[07:49.580 --> 07:52.440]  So if you could just pop that to the side for now, I'd really appreciate it.
[07:52.740 --> 07:54.400]  Oh, god damn it.
[07:56.600 --> 07:57.540]  Oh, it's terrible.
[07:58.060 --> 07:59.640]  Give me a second to put this chair away.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.660]  I was really excited to sit in it.
[08:01.900 --> 08:02.640]  Keep it close.
[08:02.760 --> 08:04.120]  Next episode's right around the corner.
[08:09.020 --> 08:09.880]  God damn it.
[08:09.980 --> 08:10.700]  I hate you guys.
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.280]  I love you guys, but I hate you guys.
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.740]  We're just trying to be fair about it.
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.600]  I just want to sit in the new chair.
[08:16.420 --> 08:18.160]  I've had this chair for so long.
[08:18.420 --> 08:20.820]  The problem is you could have done it at any point in the past,
[08:20.840 --> 08:22.080]  and you're the reason you didn't.
[08:22.240 --> 08:22.700]  And now...
[08:22.700 --> 08:23.940]  Because I said I would...
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.080]  What you've done is you've built up this really funny bit,
[08:27.180 --> 08:28.680]  and now we're all committed to your bit.
[08:32.540 --> 08:36.840]  I was looking over my notes to try to get ready for today's episodes,
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.520]  of which there are painfully few notes, by the way.
[08:39.580 --> 08:40.520]  I have very little to talk about.
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.760]  And I got so confused by my notes.
[08:42.960 --> 08:45.140]  The number one note I had was head sheen.
[08:45.600 --> 08:50.160]  I probably spent a good three minutes at that coffee shop this morning, Gav,
[08:50.200 --> 08:52.280]  before everybody showed up, trying to figure out what the fuck I wrote.
[08:53.020 --> 08:54.000]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[08:54.260 --> 08:57.780]  I eventually got there, but I was so fucking mad at myself
[08:57.780 --> 09:00.060]  for not explaining what I was thinking there.
[09:00.500 --> 09:04.080]  Yeah, we did a Sloppy Joe's Bingo recently under the new podcast,
[09:04.220 --> 09:05.940]  and I think it was our best one.
[09:06.340 --> 09:07.060]  I had so much fun.
[09:07.240 --> 09:11.820]  And we've thought about changing up the list, adding some new things,
[09:11.920 --> 09:13.420]  and head sheen was one of the new spots.
[09:13.420 --> 09:15.660]  Yeah, I have overstayed your welcome.
[09:15.900 --> 09:16.620]  Head sheen.
[09:16.720 --> 09:17.800]  Dog out too late.
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.860]  That's what helped me figure it out.
[09:18.860 --> 09:20.220]  New boot goofing.
[09:20.600 --> 09:22.220]  Dickhead truck and move along.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.820]  Move along did not help at all.
[09:25.220 --> 09:27.840]  We were so close to losing pink taxi.
[09:28.560 --> 09:30.500]  And then pink taxi showed up.
[09:31.000 --> 09:31.160]  Terrible.
[09:31.580 --> 09:32.580]  Oh, clown car.
[09:33.000 --> 09:33.460]  Clown car.
[09:33.520 --> 09:34.320]  We gotta add clown car.
[09:34.880 --> 09:35.340]  Clown car.
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.200]  I got my wheelchair, finally.
[09:37.680 --> 09:39.980]  I've been waiting three different Sloppy Joe's.
[09:40.260 --> 09:41.140]  Oh yeah, you got a convoy of them.
[09:41.660 --> 09:42.920]  I won, finally.
[09:42.980 --> 09:45.140]  Finally, Eric lost a Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[09:45.220 --> 09:45.820]  It was a great night.
[09:46.040 --> 09:46.320]  Yeah.
[09:46.480 --> 09:48.560]  Do you know what I found out today at coffee?
[09:49.480 --> 09:57.780]  That at his old job, Jeff used to sit on a raised platform above all the other employees.
[10:00.080 --> 10:02.220]  I don't know why this sticks out to you.
[10:02.380 --> 10:04.280]  I didn't choose to sit there.
[10:04.460 --> 10:06.160]  It was my job to sit there.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.800]  I was paid to sit there.
[10:08.500 --> 10:10.780]  I was in charge of all of those people.
[10:11.020 --> 10:11.820]  They were my minions.
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.620]  Like a god in a prison.
[10:13.620 --> 10:18.460]  Yeah, I was Steve Carell and they were my little worker tech minions and they,
[10:18.700 --> 10:20.300]  they, yeah.
[10:20.460 --> 10:24.720]  And I had to, I had to stay, I had to keep an eye on them all, man.
[10:24.840 --> 10:27.280]  It was Jason and Nick and a bunch of other lunatics.
[10:27.680 --> 10:31.340]  Becca and fucking Gus and like, they were, they're maniacs.
[10:31.420 --> 10:32.500]  You sat above Gus?
[10:32.880 --> 10:33.240]  Yeah.
[10:33.820 --> 10:39.540]  Dude, so that, but what that really meant though, is that like a Panopticon, everyone could see you.
[10:40.660 --> 10:41.140]  Panopticon?
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.100]  Is that a Pokemon?
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.780]  What's a Panopticon?
[10:45.340 --> 10:50.000]  I think it was a type of like circular jail where like one guard could watch every prisoner.
[10:50.220 --> 10:50.540]  Oh, wow.
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.500]  Oh, we went to one of those, huh?
[10:52.860 --> 10:54.680]  I only know it because of, uh...
[10:54.680 --> 10:55.800]  This is crazy.
[10:56.320 --> 10:59.980]  That is, it was a way of having a lot of prisoners and very few staff.
[11:00.300 --> 11:03.420]  But I know that word because there's a Panopticon in control.
[11:03.960 --> 11:07.940]  We, we did that in, uh, fuck, where were we?
[11:08.040 --> 11:08.460]  Louisiana?
[11:08.900 --> 11:10.080]  That jail was a Panopticon.
[11:10.220 --> 11:10.740]  Remember, Gav?
[11:11.220 --> 11:11.760]  Was it?
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.120]  I'm pretty sure.
[11:13.120 --> 11:14.680]  Have I been in a Panopticon?
[11:15.220 --> 11:19.000]  We did that joke, Daniel Fadello did that joke we're never supposed to do on set.
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.000]  What was the joke?
[11:20.920 --> 11:26.780]  Uh, they, uh, made it look like somebody fell from the top or got hung or something.
[11:26.940 --> 11:27.680]  I can't remember exactly.
[11:28.240 --> 11:29.400]  It was a Haunter episode though.
[11:29.460 --> 11:30.120]  We did it in Haunter.
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.120]  Before today, Gavin, if somebody asked you if you had played Lost Planet or been to a Panopticon,
[11:35.280 --> 11:36.300]  would your answer have been no?
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.580]  No, it would have been yes.
[11:38.060 --> 11:39.960]  Okay, well, you just, you seem like you didn't know.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.200]  Because I went in control.
[11:42.720 --> 11:44.340]  That doesn't count!
[11:44.540 --> 11:44.940]  Oh, okay.
[11:45.860 --> 11:47.840]  Hey, Geoff, have you ever flown?
[11:48.600 --> 11:51.200]  Oh my god, yeah, I was flying earlier, thanks for asking.
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.920]  Have you ever done a 1080 on a snowboard?
[11:55.380 --> 11:57.120]  You ever dropped a nuke before?
[11:58.820 --> 11:59.660]  Hammered a Don?
[12:00.420 --> 12:01.180]  Dropped a what?
[12:01.640 --> 12:02.360]  Dropped a nuke.
[12:02.820 --> 12:03.060]  Oh.
[12:03.360 --> 12:04.440]  Like, Fallout 76?
[12:05.040 --> 12:05.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:06.000 --> 12:06.460]  Yeah.
[12:06.900 --> 12:07.360]  Yeah.
[12:07.580 --> 12:10.720]  I wonder if I'll ever be able to release all that footage.
[12:11.200 --> 12:16.140]  I took of the crew of Haunter when they all lost their freaking minds and refused to film.
[12:16.660 --> 12:20.120]  Oh, that was a frustrating night, man. That was frustrating.
[12:21.100 --> 12:23.900]  We had a lot of believers on the crew.
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.880]  And there was a, what someone deemed to be a supernatural experience.
[12:28.020 --> 12:31.720]  And then everyone legitimately freaked out for about two hours.
[12:32.080 --> 12:35.300]  They thought there were, they wouldn't film on account of real ghosts?
[12:35.460 --> 12:36.680]  They thought the ghost was real.
[12:36.780 --> 12:38.340]  And everyone was like, I'm not going out there.
[12:38.420 --> 12:39.140]  I'm not, I'm not.
[12:39.900 --> 12:43.420]  One, one of the local crew, dude, it got so much worse.
[12:43.580 --> 12:48.720]  One of the local crew said they saw an orb and it chased them.
[12:49.100 --> 12:50.500]  And they refused.
[12:50.740 --> 12:54.060]  And they, they and other members of the crew just left.
[12:54.500 --> 12:56.220]  We're like, we're not working the rest of the night.
[12:56.380 --> 12:58.260]  An orb chased me. It's going to kill me.
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.420]  And they just fucking left.
[13:00.040 --> 13:02.840]  The medic was checking someone out after something like this happened.
[13:02.900 --> 13:04.140]  And then the medic was freaking out.
[13:04.420 --> 13:05.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:05.900 --> 13:07.360]  Oh, I got so much good footage of that.
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.460]  People lost their fucking minds.
[13:09.540 --> 13:11.600]  And I got, and there was some, it was interesting.
[13:12.200 --> 13:15.180]  There's some very tense conversations with producers going like,
[13:15.240 --> 13:16.420]  are you fucking serious right now?
[13:16.600 --> 13:18.300]  Are you really scared of a ghost right now?
[13:19.940 --> 13:22.500]  Well, because I think everyone was trying to do the responsible thing.
[13:22.660 --> 13:26.620]  Like the producer was trying to keep all the crew happy and stuff, but they weren't happy.
[13:27.420 --> 13:30.380]  So they were, they were like siding with the crew, which I guess
[13:30.380 --> 13:32.980]  if I was the producer, I would also do that.
[13:33.340 --> 13:34.980]  But no, you got to want everybody to feel safe.
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.400]  But as a ghost hunter, it's like, this is why we're doing it.
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.360]  We're trying to find a stupid fucking ghost.
[13:39.500 --> 13:41.140]  We were like, roll the damn cameras.
[13:41.280 --> 13:43.960]  Don't run away from the ghost, we run towards the ghost.
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.700]  Yeah, dude, I don't know if we can film this ghost show.
[13:46.800 --> 13:49.640]  I just saw a ghost, so I'm thinking that we shouldn't do this.
[13:50.160 --> 13:51.480]  It was surreal.
[13:51.740 --> 13:53.400]  I didn't know, I didn't know what to do.
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.200]  I just sat quietly and just had to wait it out.
[13:56.280 --> 13:56.560]  Wow.
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.060]  Do you think there's any job where that's a justifiable excuse for suddenly leaving work?
[14:01.600 --> 14:04.300]  Like you work at Subway and just like, now there's a ghost.
[14:04.340 --> 14:05.920]  I got chased by an orb in the kitchen.
[14:06.440 --> 14:07.440]  I'm going home.
[14:07.720 --> 14:08.560]  I would say cemetery.
[14:08.900 --> 14:10.080]  You're like groundskeeper to cemetery.
[14:10.380 --> 14:11.600]  Oh, cemetery is a good one.
[14:11.960 --> 14:12.240]  Yeah.
[14:13.320 --> 14:14.840]  Just a half dug grave.
[14:15.200 --> 14:18.720]  I feel like if you tell any other person who works at a cemetery, I had to leave early
[14:18.720 --> 14:21.400]  if I saw a ghost, they'd be like, yeah, I got it.
[14:21.500 --> 14:21.920]  I got you.
[14:22.020 --> 14:22.340]  Yeah.
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.760]  An orb chased me.
[14:26.400 --> 14:28.960]  They got chased by Pac-Man and had to call out early.
[14:28.960 --> 14:29.800]  You know, all that.
[14:29.900 --> 14:31.180]  We did two seasons of that show.
[14:31.380 --> 14:32.860]  That only happened that time.
[14:32.980 --> 14:34.780]  Everybody else was totally had their shit together.
[14:34.920 --> 14:35.700]  Every other recording.
[14:35.840 --> 14:36.900]  It was just that was weird.
[14:37.720 --> 14:38.720]  Ghosts aren't real.
[14:38.980 --> 14:41.020]  So it didn't happen again.
[14:41.440 --> 14:41.720]  Whoa.
[14:42.040 --> 14:45.500]  It was definitely a more religious area.
[14:45.780 --> 14:46.340]  I'll say that.
[14:46.340 --> 14:47.080]  And that was.
[14:47.220 --> 14:48.320]  Yeah, it's different values.
[14:48.900 --> 14:51.000]  Eric, calm down there.
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.660]  If ghosts aren't real, explain how that guy got chased by an orb.
[14:57.620 --> 14:58.880]  You know what?
[14:59.100 --> 15:01.420]  Some things you just can't explain, I guess.
[15:01.660 --> 15:02.640]  You got me.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.820]  Somebody hasn't seen Mind Freak.
[15:05.540 --> 15:09.240]  I was thinking about all the just the phone footage I've got from over the years
[15:09.240 --> 15:13.260]  and how a lot of it was filmed, you know, for the previous company.
[15:13.460 --> 15:16.980]  But a lot of it was filmed before I worked there.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.900]  Like because we were talking last week about Rain Run, right?
[15:20.520 --> 15:22.860]  That was filmed before that show existed.
[15:22.860 --> 15:26.340]  So technically, if I just take my footage and just recut it,
[15:26.720 --> 15:28.700]  it would be a brand new thing.
[15:28.840 --> 15:31.300]  And I'm thinking maybe we just uncensor your cock.
[15:31.680 --> 15:32.180]  What?
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.740]  Yeah, you want to re-release that video,
[15:38.040 --> 15:42.300]  but I'm swinging my dick everywhere while I'm bleeding and covered in glass and mud.
[15:42.300 --> 15:43.520]  Let's go behind the paint wall.
[15:44.060 --> 15:45.240]  It would be a new product.
[15:45.940 --> 15:46.520]  It's true.
[15:46.780 --> 15:47.320]  It's true.
[15:48.420 --> 15:51.620]  The Gavin cut is just dicks are shown.
[15:51.620 --> 15:53.040]  It's the only difference.
[15:53.220 --> 15:53.940]  It's everything else.
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.080]  He just flips the bar so only the dick is visible.
[15:58.460 --> 16:00.000]  The rest of the screen's blacked out.
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.120]  It's this. Is this the thumbnail for it?
[16:03.560 --> 16:06.420]  Yeah, Jeff's cock fell out in the middle of that.
[16:07.500 --> 16:07.720]  Yeah.
[16:10.580 --> 16:13.940]  We were running in the rain and because it was lightning and thundering
[16:13.940 --> 16:15.660]  and it was like shitting down rain.
[16:15.840 --> 16:17.740]  And so we were taking turns and filming it.
[16:17.820 --> 16:18.840]  And it was my turn.
[16:18.840 --> 16:24.480]  I ran out into the street and I slid and I fucking went knee first into a bunch of gravel.
[16:25.020 --> 16:27.180]  And it just ripped my shin and my knee out.
[16:27.280 --> 16:30.840]  I was covered in blood, blew out my pants.
[16:30.980 --> 16:33.080]  And I ran back in going, I'm in a lot of pain.
[16:33.140 --> 16:33.720]  I'm in a lot of pain.
[16:33.780 --> 16:34.200]  I'm really hurt.
[16:34.240 --> 16:34.640]  I'm really hurt.
[16:34.700 --> 16:35.480]  They're laughing at me.
[16:35.500 --> 16:38.220]  And I ran into the bathroom and I put my pants down,
[16:38.520 --> 16:39.600]  bent over to pull my pants down.
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.640]  And there's just like blood and skin and rocks and shit sticking out of my leg.
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.360]  And I went, oh, and I stood back up and I hit a glass countertop
[16:48.360 --> 16:52.460]  that had like all the deodorant and razors and soap and shit on it.
[16:52.580 --> 16:57.620]  And it shattered all around me on the ground with my dick out and blood everywhere.
[16:57.840 --> 16:59.120]  And then I was, it was just brutal.
[16:59.240 --> 16:59.960]  It was a long night.
[17:00.160 --> 17:01.300]  That sounds terrible.
[17:02.640 --> 17:04.140]  Gavin filmed the whole thing.
[17:04.280 --> 17:04.580]  That's true.
[17:04.920 --> 17:06.080]  And he still has it.
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.400]  He still has the uncensored dick just waiting.
[17:12.220 --> 17:15.420]  Were you holding onto that footage, Gavin, for some reason to use?
[17:16.500 --> 17:17.800]  Do you just save all your footage?
[17:17.800 --> 17:20.040]  He uses it pretty regularly, if you know what I mean.
[17:23.480 --> 17:27.820]  I feel like getting a gravel injury on your dick would be especially bad.
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.880]  I feel like gravel would struggle to hurt the dick.
[17:30.940 --> 17:32.340]  The dick just gets moved out the way.
[17:33.700 --> 17:36.840]  I don't, if you're falling, I don't, I don't, I disagree.
[17:37.260 --> 17:40.620]  I feel like gravel is all like palm of hands and shins and knees.
[17:40.740 --> 17:42.360]  It's all the stuff that isn't malleable.
[17:42.720 --> 17:45.920]  Yeah, I feel like the, it's like a dick defense mechanism you have
[17:45.920 --> 17:51.320]  is that it's so malleable, it knows to avoid, it like pings off of danger.
[17:51.960 --> 17:54.760]  Like, I can't remember the last time I banged my dick on something.
[17:57.320 --> 17:58.860]  It has a lot of protection.
[17:59.600 --> 18:01.460]  In a scenario in which it's exposed.
[18:03.820 --> 18:05.760]  Anytime I think of banging dicks,
[18:06.080 --> 18:09.140]  I think of that survivor challenge where they blindfold everybody
[18:09.140 --> 18:13.680]  and they make the people on the tall platform and direct them through the maze.
[18:13.840 --> 18:14.820]  But it's all dick height.
[18:14.820 --> 18:18.020]  And it's all like jagged wood sticking out
[18:18.020 --> 18:20.340]  and people just rack themselves over and over again.
[18:20.980 --> 18:22.040]  They don't do that anymore.
[18:22.160 --> 18:24.700]  That was the ultimate survivor.
[18:25.320 --> 18:27.480]  They do, they kept dropping shit on each other's heads and...
[18:28.260 --> 18:28.600]  Oh, yeah.
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.000]  Is that what you're imagining?
[18:30.000 --> 18:30.680]  Yeah, that's your penis.
[18:31.300 --> 18:33.200]  Your dick, gravel, Gavin.
[18:35.280 --> 18:37.380]  Everybody, dicks are Muhammad Ali.
[18:37.900 --> 18:40.520]  Can we motion track the text onto the box of glove?
[18:40.580 --> 18:41.240]  It just says gravel.
[18:42.240 --> 18:44.980]  And dick onto Muhammad Ali's head.
[18:45.940 --> 18:47.180]  Just dodging.
[18:49.080 --> 18:50.480]  Hey, it's Paris.
[18:50.940 --> 18:53.080]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[18:53.260 --> 18:54.780]  Like stars, duh.
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.960]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[18:59.660 --> 19:03.880]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[19:04.080 --> 19:08.580]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[19:09.140 --> 19:11.640]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[19:12.160 --> 19:12.860]  That's hot.
[19:13.500 --> 19:16.560]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[19:16.940 --> 19:18.300]  Hilton for the stay.
[19:38.940 --> 19:40.820]  They become quite practical.
[19:41.380 --> 19:44.560]  The new Volkswagen Teguan 2025 with premium functions,
[19:44.720 --> 19:48.740]  like the front seats with available massage, only looks extravagant.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.380]  Do you remember stuff at school?
[19:51.400 --> 19:54.880]  Like, do you remember having things at school that made you laugh and you couldn't?
[19:55.500 --> 19:59.440]  You couldn't laugh, so you would always try and hold in the laughter and end up going like...
[20:00.280 --> 20:01.820]  Yeah, I think I talked about one.
[20:02.080 --> 20:04.220]  I remembered a recent one that I just couldn't...
[20:04.220 --> 20:05.940]  I could not hold in the laughter.
[20:05.940 --> 20:09.340]  It made me laugh like 20 minutes after the thing happened.
[20:09.820 --> 20:15.560]  I had this humanities teacher who, when the class was being too rowdy,
[20:16.020 --> 20:18.140]  he would just write on the corner of the whiteboard.
[20:18.200 --> 20:23.320]  He'd just make a small box and then as more minutes passed, he would write a number in there.
[20:23.500 --> 20:27.780]  So if we were like dicking around for two minutes, he would just put a two in the box
[20:28.120 --> 20:31.400]  and eventually get to the point where people would see like eight and be like,
[20:31.440 --> 20:32.680]  oh, we're going to miss the whole of breaks.
[20:32.800 --> 20:33.740]  Everyone would shut up.
[20:33.740 --> 20:39.080]  But once he, uh, we were doing like a projection, like the overhead projector thing.
[20:39.160 --> 20:43.180]  He pulled down the screen in front of the whiteboard and was projecting stuff.
[20:43.660 --> 20:48.040]  And the class was dicking around and he just quickly pulled out the marker and wrote the box,
[20:48.260 --> 20:51.600]  but he wrote it on the projection screen instead of the whiteboard.
[20:52.340 --> 20:53.360]  And everyone laughed.
[20:54.260 --> 20:56.960]  Everyone laughed and he was really, really annoyed.
[20:57.060 --> 20:58.220]  He was trying to rub it off.
[20:58.380 --> 20:59.900]  He couldn't get it off because it was fabric.
[21:00.680 --> 21:05.820]  And for some reason, every minute that passed, it would come back into my head.
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.980]  And I just kept laughing.
[21:06.980 --> 21:11.300]  And I was like laughing into my, into my fingers.
[21:11.460 --> 21:15.720]  I like shoved my hand over my mouth and I could not, it was the funniest thing
[21:15.720 --> 21:17.820]  in the world to me in that moment.
[21:18.360 --> 21:20.900]  And then as soon as I left the classroom, I was like, oh, wasn't that funny.
[21:21.200 --> 21:25.340]  But getting stuck in the moment, I just could not shift it.
[21:25.340 --> 21:26.900]  It was the funniest thing in the world.
[21:27.700 --> 21:31.500]  And it stayed on there for like two years.
[21:31.700 --> 21:33.440]  Every time I had a lesson in that room,
[21:33.660 --> 21:39.660]  there'd be just two lines making a corner in the top right of the projection screen.
[21:39.720 --> 21:41.260]  Was it funny every time you saw it?
[21:41.440 --> 21:41.720]  Yeah.
[21:42.100 --> 21:45.240]  Not as funny as the first time, but it did make me cackle every time.
[21:45.940 --> 21:47.720]  That was my question is how long it lasted.
[21:47.960 --> 21:49.400]  I'd like to imagine it's still there.
[21:50.080 --> 21:50.840]  Oh, that'd be so good.
[21:50.840 --> 21:53.380]  I don't think they use those projectors anymore.
[21:53.840 --> 21:54.960]  I can't imagine.
[21:54.960 --> 21:57.380]  It was like one of those desktop overhead.
[21:57.880 --> 22:01.040]  Do you have anything in your classes that...
[22:01.040 --> 22:02.400]  What was the one you mentioned, Andrew, before?
[22:02.780 --> 22:03.100]  I can't remember.
[22:03.240 --> 22:06.220]  I had two. I had one where I was...
[22:06.220 --> 22:12.260]  My mom included the book version of the Steve Martin Pink Panther movie.
[22:12.620 --> 22:14.760]  And there's just images from the film.
[22:15.180 --> 22:18.380]  The camouflage just kept getting me.
[22:18.820 --> 22:24.060]  The other one that I just remembered, and it's not, as he said, it is so not funny,
[22:24.060 --> 22:27.500]  but it's just you're in that loop of it is the funniest thing ever.
[22:27.680 --> 22:29.940]  And then you become aware that it's not as funny.
[22:30.060 --> 22:31.260]  And that just makes it funnier.
[22:31.960 --> 22:34.080]  We had to do like a creative writing thing.
[22:34.440 --> 22:40.060]  And my friend and I were writing like a Star Wars pun based thing for the class.
[22:40.340 --> 22:44.220]  And we're calling stuff like instead of lightsaber, they were lifesavers.
[22:44.420 --> 22:45.760]  Like it was a candy sword.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.400]  And that was the funniest shit ever, even though it's not funny at all.
[22:49.500 --> 22:53.620]  And just could not stop no matter what is getting in trouble.
[22:53.620 --> 22:56.680]  And like trying to you desperately want to stop laughing.
[22:56.880 --> 22:57.980]  But you just can't.
[22:58.160 --> 22:58.920]  You're just stuck.
[22:59.440 --> 23:05.260]  Do you remember the the most or like the hardest you've ever laughed in your entire life?
[23:05.860 --> 23:06.340]  No.
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.000]  Oh, I wish I could.
[23:09.660 --> 23:14.540]  I think once again, I think I told this before on the show, but there is when I went to save
[23:14.540 --> 23:17.700]  my friend Brandon in PUBG and accidentally ran him over with the car.
[23:17.880 --> 23:20.000]  I laughed so hard I almost fainted.
[23:20.520 --> 23:21.840]  That's that's rare.
[23:22.100 --> 23:22.960]  That's a rare time.
[23:24.400 --> 23:29.560]  There there was a moment in a let's play we were doing years ago where a Jeep came in
[23:29.560 --> 23:32.080]  to save it, save us, and it ran over Jack.
[23:32.140 --> 23:36.600]  And I remember I remember laughing for like a week straight after that.
[23:38.660 --> 23:40.820]  But he was great in that regard.
[23:40.920 --> 23:41.680]  That just popped in my head.
[23:41.760 --> 23:43.000]  That's that's not the moment.
[23:43.080 --> 23:44.780]  But man, what was the moment?
[23:44.860 --> 23:45.260]  Do you have one?
[23:45.300 --> 23:46.060]  I don't know.
[23:46.340 --> 23:51.960]  I'm like the only thing that comes to mind is actually it's a Gavin moment.
[23:51.960 --> 23:55.700]  But the night that Gavin and I and it's the night it is the night that Gavin tried to
[23:55.700 --> 23:56.840]  fuck me, but that's not what this is about.
[23:57.120 --> 23:57.460]  Come on.
[23:57.480 --> 24:00.080]  It's the night that that's what you said that night.
[24:00.400 --> 24:03.960]  When I said no, it's it's the night we watched.
[24:04.100 --> 24:06.120]  For some reason, we watched Tommy Boy together.
[24:06.120 --> 24:09.120]  And that that night, I was like the 20th time I'd seen it.
[24:09.120 --> 24:12.740]  But I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as as watching Tommy with you that night.
[24:13.220 --> 24:14.900]  Something about just the right night and the right.
[24:15.120 --> 24:16.800]  Yeah, the right environment, the right people.
[24:16.860 --> 24:18.440]  It was like a party was happening behind us.
[24:18.440 --> 24:21.420]  It was the kind of laughter where like Jeff's lent back
[24:21.420 --> 24:26.420]  on the couch and his legs are kicking it like 50 times and the whole couch is like
[24:28.740 --> 24:29.540]  Home Alone.
[24:29.740 --> 24:32.260]  Anytime if I if I go a good six months without seeing Home Alone,
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.560]  it's like watching it for the first time.
[24:34.620 --> 24:35.480]  That gets me.
[24:36.220 --> 24:40.360]  I would honestly say Andrew's story about his ankles had me up maybe in a top 10 laugh.
[24:43.120 --> 24:45.400]  I'm glad my pain can bring you such joy.
[24:46.260 --> 24:46.500]  Yeah.
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.660]  And it wasn't even a live pain.
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.040]  It was just a retelling of your pain.
[24:49.620 --> 24:49.840]  Yeah.
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.720]  Recapping pain.
[24:51.940 --> 24:53.740]  If I watched you do it, I wouldn't have laughed at all.
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.460]  You you told me a story one time about walking through the woods and some guys
[24:58.460 --> 25:00.060]  bullying you and taking your jacket.
[25:00.220 --> 25:01.960]  And I remember this wasn't on content or anything.
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.980]  And I just remember laughing my ass off in that story the way you told it being very,
[25:06.140 --> 25:06.400]  very funny.
[25:06.540 --> 25:07.320]  Do you remember that?
[25:07.880 --> 25:09.300]  I don't remember that.
[25:09.400 --> 25:15.260]  What I immediately think of with Woods was I had a friend who had an Airsoft birthday party.
[25:15.820 --> 25:20.660]  And so we met this guy and then he drove us into the woods and he played for some reason.
[25:21.040 --> 25:21.620]  It was very odd.
[25:22.140 --> 25:24.460]  But my mom was worried I'd get hurt.
[25:24.600 --> 25:28.320]  So she put me in the biggest, like, sweater that I had.
[25:28.500 --> 25:30.280]  But it was like a rainbow sweater.
[25:30.740 --> 25:34.980]  So it just resulted in me getting pelted by by bullets or the pellets.
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.140]  Because I were in the woods.
[25:37.240 --> 25:38.060]  Everything's green.
[25:38.320 --> 25:41.360]  And I'm wearing like a bright red and orange and yellow.
[25:41.380 --> 25:43.560]  Like I was the most visible thing.
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.780]  Yeah, a giant shoot me sweater.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.120]  And I just got destroyed because of it.
[25:49.660 --> 25:52.700]  It was the reverse of camo, as Eric just said.
[25:53.700 --> 25:55.560]  I was not a fun time.
[25:55.620 --> 25:57.120]  I'm trying to think of any other good pain.
[25:57.580 --> 26:00.180]  I mean, I fell in that box recently at first.
[26:00.580 --> 26:04.620]  I still I don't I should just get rid of that basket that I have in my bathroom because I
[26:04.620 --> 26:05.380]  don't use it.
[26:05.680 --> 26:10.780]  And all I've used it for is stepping in it accidentally and then going headfirst into it.
[26:11.900 --> 26:14.060]  It's really brought me zero joy.
[26:16.180 --> 26:20.700]  I know it's probably not like the funniest moment probably wouldn't be during content.
[26:20.780 --> 26:22.240]  But for some reason, that's what pops up the most.
[26:22.460 --> 26:27.660]  The time that Gavin and I were doing a let's play an MLB like that 2K baseball game.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.540]  And he referred to the batter's box as a staple.
[26:31.020 --> 26:34.240]  And for some reason that made I shit my pants.
[26:34.460 --> 26:35.840]  I laughed so hard in that moment.
[26:35.920 --> 26:37.400]  I had to run to the bathroom and clean up.
[26:37.500 --> 26:38.600]  And so we could finish the video.
[26:38.820 --> 26:39.880]  You were drinking back then, though.
[26:39.880 --> 26:41.760]  It was easy to get you to shit your pants.
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.800]  That might be the only time I've laughed so hard.
[26:44.860 --> 26:46.100]  I literally shit my pants.
[26:46.940 --> 26:51.940]  Yeah, that was our that was our first let's play together after I came back.
[26:52.660 --> 26:53.440]  Was it really?
[26:53.800 --> 26:54.000]  Yeah.
[26:54.360 --> 26:54.840]  Oh, that's cool.
[26:54.980 --> 26:55.140]  Wow.
[26:55.300 --> 26:58.040]  Probably the first one since the jump shot in Left 4 Dead.
[27:01.420 --> 27:04.880]  That was the first real let's play we ever did.
[27:04.960 --> 27:05.140]  Maybe.
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.920]  Yeah, I decided I wanted to make achievement guides, but record the commentary live as we
[27:08.920 --> 27:09.680]  try to get him.
[27:10.500 --> 27:11.940]  Just try to do let's plays, really.
[27:12.300 --> 27:12.720]  Oh, wow.
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.500]  I mean, yeah, it's essentially that.
[27:15.180 --> 27:15.700]  That was great.
[27:16.220 --> 27:19.100]  I'm still missing one achievement, I think, in the original Left 4 Dead.
[27:19.620 --> 27:20.360]  Oh, which one?
[27:20.820 --> 27:23.560]  I think it was one of the DLC ones, I want to say.
[27:24.280 --> 27:27.160]  God, do you remember that night you and I tried to clean up DLC achievements?
[27:27.260 --> 27:28.760]  Yeah, I think so bad at Left 4 Dead.
[27:28.840 --> 27:30.480]  We said we'd never talk about it.
[27:31.140 --> 27:34.280]  And I remember because you were playing with Andrew and I wasn't either.
[27:34.340 --> 27:34.940]  I wasn't a part of it.
[27:34.940 --> 27:35.540]  I was watching.
[27:35.540 --> 27:37.080]  But you stopped.
[27:37.380 --> 27:40.760]  You put down the controller, took off your headset at the end of that, and you were like,
[27:41.320 --> 27:42.420]  I think Andrew's lost it.
[27:44.800 --> 27:45.360]  I did.
[27:45.620 --> 27:45.900]  It's gone.
[27:46.420 --> 27:47.380]  The magic was gone.
[27:47.780 --> 27:48.660]  It was a bad night.
[27:48.940 --> 27:51.300]  I think we got to have discs, right?
[27:51.340 --> 27:52.040]  That's the only hold up.
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.500]  But I would love, love for us to do let's plays in Left 4 Dead.
[27:56.820 --> 27:59.420]  Well, you found a whole bundle of discs.
[28:00.260 --> 28:00.900]  So we should have them.
[28:00.900 --> 28:02.000]  I'll have to see if there's any in there.
[28:02.160 --> 28:02.280]  Yeah.
[28:02.680 --> 28:03.900]  Yeah, you took a big spindle.
[28:03.900 --> 28:06.140]  Yeah, it's crazy to me.
[28:06.260 --> 28:07.280]  You didn't look through that.
[28:07.500 --> 28:10.260]  Like, I would I just I would have to check if I were you.
[28:10.820 --> 28:12.200]  It'd be so you just grabbed it.
[28:12.740 --> 28:15.020]  Yeah, it was just my it was my old stuff.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.660]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[28:17.680 --> 28:20.280]  I guess for me, if I here's a copy of Amped 3.
[28:21.940 --> 28:26.060]  The Simpsons game, Kane and Lynch, Top Spin, Madden 06.
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.440]  Are you looking through right now?
[28:27.820 --> 28:28.040]  Yeah.
[28:28.320 --> 28:29.260]  Connect Adventures.
[28:30.340 --> 28:30.980]  Superman Returns.
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.040]  This game is worth a lot of money now.
[28:32.260 --> 28:32.660]  Wow.
[28:32.760 --> 28:33.420]  Red Dead Redemption.
[28:34.300 --> 28:35.200]  Red Dead Redemption.
[28:35.500 --> 28:36.780]  I don't I'm not seeing any left for dead.
[28:36.860 --> 28:37.380]  Oh, a quake.
[28:37.560 --> 28:38.860]  Multiple copies of Quake 4.
[28:39.280 --> 28:39.880]  Hell yeah.
[28:40.840 --> 28:41.940]  We just played that.
[28:42.240 --> 28:43.220]  Eric, you'll love this.
[28:43.320 --> 28:47.360]  I have a copy of Smackdown vs. Raw 2007.
[28:48.360 --> 28:49.600]  That game sucks.
[28:51.980 --> 28:53.460]  Get ready to do Let's Plays in it.
[28:53.620 --> 28:55.100]  Here's my copy of Open Season.
[28:55.900 --> 28:56.140]  Nice.
[28:57.160 --> 29:02.260]  This podcast has turned into Jeff saying names of things and Nick going,
[29:02.260 --> 29:04.240]  Oh, I'm captivated.
[29:04.420 --> 29:05.600]  I'm like, I'm waiting for left for dead.
[29:05.780 --> 29:06.920]  I'm not going to say any more names.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.180]  I'll just I'll just say it if if it shows up.
[29:09.240 --> 29:10.380]  You announce it with the love of dead.
[29:10.500 --> 29:10.820]  Double Agent.
[29:11.220 --> 29:11.980]  That's a great game.
[29:12.160 --> 29:13.120]  I love Double Agent.
[29:13.220 --> 29:14.600]  That's probably my favorite Splinter Cell.
[29:15.380 --> 29:16.440]  Gavin, what's your favorite Splinter Cell?
[29:18.740 --> 29:19.460]  Uh, probably.
[29:20.460 --> 29:22.520]  I mean, Double Agent had really good multiplayer.
[29:23.240 --> 29:24.400]  Maybe the third one, Chaos Theory.
[29:25.140 --> 29:26.060]  Chaos Theory is good too.
[29:26.920 --> 29:29.920]  I have a new product idea that I'm really happy with.
[29:29.920 --> 29:32.500]  But I don't know how we do it.
[29:32.560 --> 29:34.700]  We don't really have a Tony in our lives anymore.
[29:34.920 --> 29:37.260]  Sadly, this would be a classic Tony product.
[29:37.460 --> 29:39.960]  But I was thinking about what would be something,
[29:40.140 --> 29:43.020]  you know, in the same vein of we did the the clogged tube.
[29:43.580 --> 29:48.960]  What is like a product anyone could use or that like has a purpose, a real purpose?
[29:49.380 --> 29:52.640]  And I thought toothbrushes, regulation toothbrush.
[29:52.940 --> 29:54.180]  And that was my first thought.
[29:54.380 --> 29:57.560]  And I thought, what if we put a grown tube in a toothbrush?
[29:58.060 --> 29:59.400]  I think that would work really well.
[29:59.400 --> 30:02.420]  Because you got the swivel motion, the left and right.
[30:03.160 --> 30:05.400]  Like, I think it would actually function.
[30:05.680 --> 30:08.260]  Allow me to modify this a little bit when you're done.
[30:08.320 --> 30:08.660]  Of course.
[30:09.480 --> 30:11.120]  No, I want to hear the modification now.
[30:11.720 --> 30:15.480]  I've always thought about what's the problem with a toothbrush, right?
[30:16.140 --> 30:18.000]  At the end of the day, what's the problem?
[30:18.700 --> 30:21.080]  You brush your lower teeth,
[30:21.340 --> 30:25.060]  then you got to flip the toothbrush to brush your upper teeth.
[30:25.380 --> 30:26.960]  You're doing the work twice.
[30:26.960 --> 30:31.360]  Why don't we invent a toothbrush that has the bristles on the bottom and the top
[30:31.360 --> 30:33.760]  so you're brushing both sets of teeth at the same time?
[30:33.980 --> 30:35.960]  I like that, like a double...
[30:35.960 --> 30:38.120]  Double-edged, yeah.
[30:38.880 --> 30:41.960]  Like a great sword for toothbrushes.
[30:43.420 --> 30:46.220]  Now, is it front and back or top and bottom?
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.460]  Oh, you know, it'd be even better if it was like a toilet plunger and it was just all bristles.
[30:53.940 --> 30:54.380]  That's...
[30:54.960 --> 30:56.380]  Eric is posting photos.
[30:56.380 --> 30:58.560]  Once again, this shit exists.
[30:58.880 --> 31:02.220]  That one is for both sides of the teeth at the same time.
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.160]  Nick said, oops, all bristles.
[31:06.860 --> 31:09.300]  What are the names of these toothbrushes, Eric?
[31:09.840 --> 31:12.060]  If I want a double side, what is that called?
[31:12.160 --> 31:17.400]  The last one that I just sent is called the Nano 360 three-sided toothbrush.
[31:17.620 --> 31:18.180]  So you're getting...
[31:19.080 --> 31:23.140]  You're getting the front, the back and the top on a brush,
[31:23.140 --> 31:27.340]  but it's not quite what Jeff is talking about, where it's both sides.
[31:27.600 --> 31:29.640]  It's also not 360 degrees.
[31:29.660 --> 31:31.200]  I agree with you.
[31:31.660 --> 31:34.540]  Otherwise, I'll be brushing the underneath of your teeth roots.
[31:35.060 --> 31:42.820]  The first one is an Arthur Culpare proposed double-sided toothbrush that saves time.
[31:43.260 --> 31:48.740]  Most double-sided toothbrushes that you find are really only focusing on the front and backs of
[31:48.740 --> 31:55.940]  and not the top and bottom at the same time, which I guess makes sense if you really think about it.
[31:56.320 --> 31:57.720]  Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.
[31:58.420 --> 31:59.200]  Damn, Oral-B.
[32:00.420 --> 32:01.060]  Oral-B.
[32:01.880 --> 32:05.100]  There's no way Oral-B has put a grown tube in a toothbrush.
[32:05.560 --> 32:06.480]  So he's still got that.
[32:06.960 --> 32:07.860]  That's true. That's true.
[32:08.060 --> 32:09.780]  The problem would be it's chunky, right?
[32:09.820 --> 32:10.820]  That'd be a thick toothbrush.
[32:11.280 --> 32:11.560]  Yeah.
[32:11.860 --> 32:16.520]  Couldn't you take the keychain one that we had and tape it on there and give it a shot?
[32:17.340 --> 32:18.120]  Yes, I could.
[32:18.120 --> 32:19.840]  As a prototype, I like that idea a lot.
[32:19.980 --> 32:21.320]  Yeah, yeah, you could prototype that for us.
[32:21.380 --> 32:24.440]  Just record the sound while you brush your teeth so we can hear how it sounds.
[32:25.020 --> 32:25.460]  I will.
[32:25.840 --> 32:28.400]  While you're doing that, you should invent a grown pencil too,
[32:28.520 --> 32:31.780]  so that every time you make a mistake and you flip it up to erase it, you get a grown.
[32:32.760 --> 32:33.700]  Just goes, oops.
[32:33.800 --> 32:36.100]  That's a fucking great idea.
[32:36.620 --> 32:40.140]  Now you can hear, now there's an audible sound every time you fuck up.
[32:42.840 --> 32:44.660]  As long as I don't have to eat it, I'm on board.
[32:45.140 --> 32:46.040]  I like this idea a lot.
[32:46.500 --> 32:47.640]  That'd be your redemption, yeah.
[32:48.760 --> 32:55.400]  Have you ever thought about becoming friends with a guy called Tony and a guy called Oscar
[32:57.220 --> 33:01.520]  and maybe like an Emily and trying to get like a friendship EGOT?
[33:03.140 --> 33:07.080]  I know a Tony and Oscar and an Emily. I'm married to an Emily.
[33:07.480 --> 33:10.340]  I think finding someone called Grammy might be a bit difficult.
[33:10.840 --> 33:11.900]  What about a Gavin?
[33:13.380 --> 33:13.800]  Oh!
[33:14.780 --> 33:15.360]  What do you mean?
[33:16.220 --> 33:16.620]  Emily?
[33:17.020 --> 33:17.060]  Gavin?
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.060]  Your name starts with G.
[33:20.640 --> 33:24.260]  I mean, do you guys not understand what Gavin's saying?
[33:27.100 --> 33:28.200]  Emmy and Emily.
[33:29.560 --> 33:32.220]  Gavin, I just want to say that you made perfect sense.
[33:32.840 --> 33:35.880]  You made perfect sense through the whole way. I'm just letting you know.
[33:35.940 --> 33:39.420]  Yeah, you made perfect sense and only one person got it and the rest of us didn't.
[33:39.520 --> 33:40.860]  Yeah, and explained it to us.
[33:41.360 --> 33:41.760]  Oh shit.
[33:42.540 --> 33:43.140]  You and me, Eric.
[33:43.920 --> 33:44.700]  That's on them.
[33:44.700 --> 33:49.460]  I don't know why they're pointing fingers. It made sense when you said Tony and Oscar.
[33:49.800 --> 33:52.200]  Like it all made sense. 100%.
[33:52.200 --> 33:53.840]  You think there are any listeners named Grammy?
[33:55.140 --> 33:57.920]  You think anyone who listens to this show is named Grammy?
[33:58.520 --> 34:00.540]  Does anyone have that nickname for their grandmother?
[34:00.940 --> 34:04.440]  That's exactly what it's going to be. People are going to go grandmother. Yeah, 100%.
[34:05.100 --> 34:08.240]  Oh, Nick says his mom is Grammy.
[34:08.540 --> 34:09.580]  Yeah, to my kid.
[34:11.240 --> 34:14.620]  Can you introduce your mom to Gavin for this bit?
[34:15.920 --> 34:17.270]  You can only call her Grammy though.
[34:19.900 --> 34:22.960]  I'm sure she'll love that. I'm sure he'll love that.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.780]  Yeah, I have a game.
[34:28.140 --> 34:30.720]  Oh, sweet. I got a game too. I'm going to do it next episode.
[34:31.500 --> 34:34.120]  Oh, you're going to do next episode? Let me get my game together.
[34:34.440 --> 34:35.400]  Hey, Eric, you got a game?
[34:35.980 --> 34:37.620]  No, man, I'm along for the ride on this one.
[34:37.820 --> 34:38.600]  I don't have a game either.
[34:38.960 --> 34:39.580]  I just want to play.
[34:39.840 --> 34:41.560]  This is a guessing game for you guys.
[34:42.060 --> 34:47.380]  As you know, my computer is a piece of shit and it'll freeze all the time.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.260]  And there'll be times where I'm going to search something
[34:50.260 --> 34:52.580]  and I'll put in all the characters correctly.
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.100]  It will freeze and then it will spit out all the things I put.
[34:57.320 --> 35:00.620]  But in a random sequence that you can't,
[35:00.980 --> 35:03.220]  unless you know what it is, isn't going to necessarily make sense.
[35:03.620 --> 35:05.900]  So I'm going to put in a recent one I had.
[35:06.420 --> 35:09.140]  And you have to tell me, what was I trying to search?
[35:10.720 --> 35:16.320]  The letters are G-E-A-M, space, N-F-T, space, O-F-F-R.
[35:16.900 --> 35:18.220]  Some sort of great offer?
[35:20.120 --> 35:21.860]  So it's been scrambled?
[35:22.980 --> 35:24.500]  It is, yes.
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.700]  Are all the letters present?
[35:28.840 --> 35:29.480]  No.
[35:32.300 --> 35:34.980]  Two of the words can be made.
[35:35.600 --> 35:36.780]  How many words was it?
[35:36.820 --> 35:37.000]  Three?
[35:37.780 --> 35:38.600]  Three words.
[35:39.360 --> 35:42.080]  I think the first word is team.
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.900]  It's either team or gleam.
[35:47.180 --> 35:47.920]  Gleam team?
[35:48.440 --> 35:49.920]  I don't think it's gleam team.
[35:50.560 --> 35:51.560]  It's not game.
[35:52.080 --> 35:53.540]  Game, N-F-T, offer.
[35:54.380 --> 35:54.720]  No.
[35:55.220 --> 35:56.740]  Yeah, Andrew's big into N-F-T.
[35:56.800 --> 35:57.480]  Yeah, he's big into N-F-T.
[35:57.480 --> 35:58.640]  N-F-T is right!
[35:58.960 --> 36:00.340]  That is part of the search.
[36:00.460 --> 36:00.800]  What?
[36:01.240 --> 36:01.560]  Oh.
[36:03.480 --> 36:03.980]  Greem?
[36:05.160 --> 36:05.660]  Mage?
[36:06.460 --> 36:06.920]  Game.
[36:07.740 --> 36:09.290]  Magic, N-F-T...
[36:11.740 --> 36:12.440]  Grmfms.
[36:12.740 --> 36:13.260]  Offsides.
[36:13.940 --> 36:16.830]  So I will say my next clue for the geem...
[36:18.420 --> 36:23.120]  Parts of the geem and parts of the offer are actually just the first word.
[36:25.320 --> 36:26.020]  Off...
[36:26.540 --> 36:27.360]  Off game.
[36:30.900 --> 36:32.370]  Offer, N-F-T...
[36:33.540 --> 36:34.240]  Grammy.
[36:34.760 --> 36:37.440]  Are you going to offer N-F-T's to Nick's mom?
[36:37.720 --> 36:39.280]  I'm not, unfortunately.
[36:39.660 --> 36:44.240]  The word I tried to search was Jeff Ramsey, N-F-T.
[36:44.780 --> 36:50.700]  Because I was thinking about when we did the ham sandwich back before we knew what N-F-T's were
[36:50.700 --> 36:51.920]  and that it was bad.
[36:52.420 --> 36:54.080]  We had a ham sandwich N-F-T.
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.020]  Eric and I were talking about it.
[36:57.040 --> 36:58.600]  I was like, where even is that now?
[36:59.120 --> 37:01.440]  How much negative money is that worth?
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.840]  And I went to search it.
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.380]  And that is what came out when I typed in Jeff Ramsey, N-F-T.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.840]  Did you ever find the N-F-T?
[37:09.900 --> 37:12.940]  No, I did not follow through on the search for the N-F-T.
[37:15.280 --> 37:16.980]  Why does your computer do that?
[37:17.840 --> 37:21.360]  Because it's from 2009 and it's an Apple.
[37:22.600 --> 37:23.700]  Maybe not that late.
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.200]  Let's see about this Mac.
[37:26.400 --> 37:29.200]  Can we track down the ham sandwich N-F-T?
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.900]  If you're listening and you're the owner of the ham sandwich N-F-T,
[37:33.320 --> 37:35.220]  please let us know how much regret you have.
[37:37.500 --> 37:38.700]  It's not for sale.
[37:39.020 --> 37:39.900]  They're not selling it.
[37:40.120 --> 37:40.460]  Oh, wow.
[37:40.920 --> 37:43.620]  I mean, like they could if they wanted to.
[37:43.740 --> 37:44.700]  I don't think they could.
[37:44.840 --> 37:45.840]  It's the fucking worst.
[37:45.900 --> 37:49.240]  It's the first ham sandwich, first N-F-T ham sandwich ever.
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.300]  It's a one of one.
[37:52.020 --> 37:53.280]  It's clearly more than only.
[37:54.000 --> 37:54.180]  Yeah.
[37:55.100 --> 37:56.280]  What other searches have you got?
[37:57.100 --> 37:58.860]  Oh, that's that's the only one I got for now.
[37:58.860 --> 38:00.840]  I'm going to update it as it goes.
[38:00.980 --> 38:03.880]  It is a short game, but it happens often.
[38:04.480 --> 38:05.900]  There's a picture of me eating the ham sandwich.
[38:07.060 --> 38:08.100]  Mustard on the outside.
[38:08.360 --> 38:08.720]  It's weird.
[38:09.540 --> 38:10.880]  I didn't like that part of it.
[38:11.860 --> 38:13.860]  I didn't really like any of it.
[38:14.860 --> 38:15.900]  It was a good ham sandwich.
[38:19.500 --> 38:23.260]  Sort of in relation to that of me misunderstanding things.
[38:23.700 --> 38:28.140]  I watched the New Zealand version of The Traders recently.
[38:28.140 --> 38:29.320]  I've been getting into The Traders.
[38:29.540 --> 38:31.160]  Oh, don't don't spoil it.
[38:31.200 --> 38:32.080]  I'm only halfway through.
[38:32.440 --> 38:34.220]  I'm not going to spoil anything for you.
[38:34.300 --> 38:41.040]  But I had I had a moment where I misinterpreted something completely where
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.200]  they were doing it.
[38:44.280 --> 38:47.000]  You know how, like in those reality shows, they knew interviews of the people
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.540]  and they react to stuff like a reality TV works.
[38:50.340 --> 38:52.980]  And one of them said Mumsay.
[38:53.740 --> 38:56.620]  And I thought, oh, is that like a New Zealand
[38:56.620 --> 38:58.300]  slang sentence?
[38:58.540 --> 39:00.460]  Is that like a like an excitement?
[39:00.740 --> 39:03.740]  Or like, does that mean like, whoa, type thing?
[39:04.680 --> 39:06.860]  And it turns out it's not.
[39:07.100 --> 39:14.000]  The woman was just saying Mumsay in reference to the fact that they were mums.
[39:14.260 --> 39:15.200]  They were moms.
[39:16.580 --> 39:17.540]  Oh, yeah.
[39:17.680 --> 39:18.080]  Mumsay.
[39:19.440 --> 39:20.400]  Mumsay, yeah.
[39:20.500 --> 39:22.240]  But I thought it was I thought it was one thing.
[39:22.300 --> 39:24.680]  I thought it was Mumsay, like a saying.
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.060]  So that has become a thing with my partner and I.
[39:29.340 --> 39:31.200]  Mumsay is like now a slang word.
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.040]  But I was convinced I thought it was like a crazy New Zealand thing.
[39:36.400 --> 39:39.020]  And I was wrong.
[39:39.200 --> 39:39.920]  I felt really dumb.
[39:40.340 --> 39:46.320]  England had a show called The Crystal Maze, hosted by Richard O'Brien from Rocky Horror.
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.560]  And he would always say Mumsay, but it was because that's what he called his mom.
[39:51.700 --> 39:53.440]  And he was in the maze as well.
[39:54.680 --> 39:55.900]  The mom was in the maze.
[39:56.180 --> 39:58.100]  I've heard Mumsay as a mom before.
[39:59.540 --> 39:59.980]  Mumsay.
[40:00.060 --> 40:00.920]  I've never heard that.
[40:01.200 --> 40:01.620]  Mumsay.
[40:01.880 --> 40:02.280]  Mumsay.
[40:02.560 --> 40:03.280]  It's like posh.
[40:03.360 --> 40:03.660]  Posh.
[40:03.980 --> 40:04.100]  Yeah.
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.140]  I hear it in a British accent.
[40:06.260 --> 40:09.240]  Yeah, it's like a little British, like a little British boy would say it.
[40:09.400 --> 40:11.500]  Or an adult pretending to be a little British boy.
[40:11.700 --> 40:12.080]  That's more.
[40:16.120 --> 40:17.140]  Today's top story.
[40:17.460 --> 40:21.480]  The flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and Chocolaty Corp.
[40:21.640 --> 40:23.520]  Joining me is a PBC executive.
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.740]  Thanks for having me, Barry.
[40:25.120 --> 40:28.160]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it,
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.340]  Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flavored Spread, would be a success?
[40:31.780 --> 40:35.600]  You know, it was a gut feeling. A rumbling, if you will.
[40:35.920 --> 40:38.100]  Besides, they're two titans of taste.
[40:38.220 --> 40:40.320]  Very true. Goes great with pretzels.
[40:40.560 --> 40:41.260]  And pancakes.
[40:41.800 --> 40:42.560]  Apples too, I bet.

[41:14.620 --> 41:18.620]  I've decided there's a new type of guy that I want to become.
[41:19.480 --> 41:19.880]  Ooh.
[41:20.140 --> 41:23.360]  I want to become a gravy in a can guy.
[41:23.680 --> 41:25.520]  What is gravy in a can?
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.300]  Oh, what?
[41:27.080 --> 41:27.840]  Yeah, I want to...
[41:27.840 --> 41:29.080]  Caramelized onion gravy?
[41:29.160 --> 41:31.260]  I want to get into gravy, but from cans.
[41:32.220 --> 41:33.980]  What would you use that for?
[41:34.400 --> 41:35.440]  What is...
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.020]  Just drink it.
[41:36.380 --> 41:36.960]  Yeah, drink it.
[41:38.340 --> 41:39.780]  They'll pick me up in the middle of the day.
[41:40.500 --> 41:43.680]  Yeah, it would be fun to leave amongst a load of beers in a cooler.
[41:43.680 --> 41:44.000]  Yeah!
[41:48.580 --> 41:51.180]  Pot. Now, have you used this? Is it good?
[41:51.300 --> 41:54.560]  No, I was too scared to buy it, but I think it would have built my confidence.
[41:55.340 --> 41:55.920]  Let's go get it.
[41:56.180 --> 41:58.960]  How are you going to be one of those guys if you won't even buy it?
[41:59.120 --> 41:59.340]  Yeah.
[41:59.900 --> 42:02.700]  It was like six bucks, I think.
[42:03.020 --> 42:05.240]  That's British, right? HP?
[42:05.360 --> 42:08.140]  Yeah, I was in the World Food...
[42:08.140 --> 42:08.380]  Yeah.
[42:08.460 --> 42:09.220]  Was it called World Market?
[42:09.740 --> 42:10.180]  Oh, yeah.
[42:10.460 --> 42:12.480]  Yeah, Nick, you want to try gravy can?
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.600]  Absolutely, let's do it.
[42:13.680 --> 42:16.440]  You guys should see who can chug a can of gravy first.
[42:17.060 --> 42:17.580]  Oh, God.
[42:18.180 --> 42:19.700]  Oh, no, I hate that.
[42:21.620 --> 42:26.300]  I don't know what I hate more, that or your piss fountain, your piss waterfall thing.
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.380]  Everybody loved the piss waterfall.
[42:28.540 --> 42:31.180]  There were zero issues. It was 100% positive.
[42:32.240 --> 42:34.840]  Most people were like, don't give us a warning next time.
[42:34.900 --> 42:36.060]  We want to be surprised by it.
[42:36.840 --> 42:39.820]  Oh, was there really backlash in the first episode?
[42:40.180 --> 42:40.840]  Very minor.
[42:41.880 --> 42:43.500]  Wow, that's funny.
[42:43.640 --> 42:46.220]  Well, that's what the podcast is supposed to be, so.
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.040]  Do you want to hear a review for Potts caramelized onion gravy made with HP sauce?
[42:52.380 --> 42:52.620]  Ooh.
[42:53.300 --> 42:55.920]  Has three stars, according to this person.
[42:56.820 --> 42:59.760]  I bought this product to use with mashed potatoes and sausages for dinner.
[43:00.220 --> 43:02.340]  I did not know what to expect from gravy in a beer can.
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.320]  I found the product to be decent, but it was more like a sweet curry rather than a gravy.
[43:08.400 --> 43:08.800]  Interesting.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.220]  Okay, so Nick, we'll get some mash and some sausages.
[43:11.700 --> 43:14.160]  We'll cook them up, pour a half a can each.
[43:14.740 --> 43:15.800]  Or do you want a full can each?
[43:16.560 --> 43:18.420]  Uh, that's a full can.
[43:18.900 --> 43:19.060]  Yeah.
[43:19.340 --> 43:26.440]  Boy, I mean, had an out and just went full can.
[43:26.520 --> 43:27.160]  I love it.
[43:27.960 --> 43:28.620]  Should we do this?
[43:28.740 --> 43:29.320]  Should we all do it?
[43:29.840 --> 43:30.200]  Yes.
[43:30.300 --> 43:30.660]  No.
[43:31.280 --> 43:31.680]  No.
[43:32.420 --> 43:35.500]  So, Eric, you're saying that if we all got together and Nick and I did the gravy
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.580]  from a can, you would just say no thanks?
[43:37.680 --> 43:39.280]  I mean, I would be excited to watch it.
[43:39.380 --> 43:39.520]  Yeah.
[43:39.640 --> 43:44.060]  Yeah, I mean, we'd cheer you on, but this definitely feels like a Gavin and Nick specific
[43:44.420 --> 43:44.780]  thing.
[43:44.980 --> 43:46.980]  Yeah, the two British guys.
[43:47.360 --> 43:53.480]  To be honest with you, if Eric and I participated, I think it would lessen the whole thing.
[43:53.740 --> 43:54.260]  I disagree.
[43:54.440 --> 43:55.200]  I'm going to vote on it.
[43:55.340 --> 43:57.160]  Should Eric drink the can of gravy?
[43:57.200 --> 43:57.800]  I vote yes.
[43:57.860 --> 43:58.140]  Yes.
[43:58.240 --> 43:59.000]  I vote yes.
[44:01.040 --> 44:03.540]  Andrew, it was a solid no when it was him.
[44:03.540 --> 44:03.980]  All right.
[44:03.980 --> 44:06.540]  Well, should Eric drink the gravy?
[44:06.680 --> 44:07.800]  I guess I'm going to guess as well.
[44:08.260 --> 44:10.680]  I love democracy.
[44:14.500 --> 44:16.460]  It's too bad our country doesn't.
[44:19.160 --> 44:20.320]  Let's do it again.
[44:21.060 --> 44:25.960]  It's like this weird strong-armed democracy where no one actually has a say in it.
[44:26.220 --> 44:27.680]  It's just bullying.
[44:27.980 --> 44:28.680]  It's great.
[44:28.980 --> 44:29.900]  It's so funny.
[44:30.200 --> 44:32.080]  I think we've completely misunderstood the concept.
[44:32.240 --> 44:32.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:33.740 --> 44:34.220]  Absolutely.
[44:34.400 --> 44:35.160]  Oh my god.
[44:35.200 --> 44:35.680]  Wow.
[44:35.900 --> 44:38.680]  Well, we got to get together and do stuff soon anyway, right?
[44:38.780 --> 44:39.440]  There's got to be something.
[44:40.200 --> 44:44.980]  Yeah, I think the problem with democracy and the way we've done it is that you're all for it unless
[44:44.980 --> 44:48.900]  it's about you, in which case you can be more against it.
[44:48.920 --> 44:50.920]  Well, I think that's democracy in general.
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.920]  I'm not really sure why you're presenting this like,
[44:54.080 --> 44:58.600]  I think maybe this is my hypothesis when you were a no and then you just voted yes.
[44:59.120 --> 45:00.600]  Like, that's clearly what happened.
[45:00.860 --> 45:01.920]  It's not a hypothesis.
[45:02.200 --> 45:03.520]  You just showed it in action.
[45:03.540 --> 45:07.060]  I had to rephrase the vote because if I said, should we all try it, I would have been out.
[45:07.800 --> 45:08.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[45:08.560 --> 45:09.040]  A hundred percent.
[45:09.360 --> 45:09.520]  Yeah.
[45:10.240 --> 45:11.380]  I'm just acknowledging that.
[45:11.880 --> 45:16.100]  I thought that was a lot of fun to vote yes, but if that was flipped, I would not have had a fun time.
[45:16.220 --> 45:17.560]  And I know the vote would have been yes.
[45:18.900 --> 45:20.580]  The question is, what gravy do you go with?
[45:20.600 --> 45:22.740]  Because they have multiple lines of gravy in a can.
[45:23.220 --> 45:25.300]  Oh, so caramelized onions is like one flavor?
[45:25.600 --> 45:28.340]  That is one flavor of pots, gravy cans.
[45:28.560 --> 45:31.500]  Well, let's get all the flavors and we'll do a blind bag.
[45:31.660 --> 45:33.420]  We'll reach in, it'll be like a potluck.
[45:34.200 --> 45:34.980]  I love it.
[45:35.020 --> 45:35.640]  Let's do it.
[45:36.100 --> 45:39.460]  I've been wanting to do a blind taste test for a while with something.
[45:40.300 --> 45:42.300]  I was thinking it'd be fun to get all those.
[45:42.540 --> 45:44.980]  Remember a while back, I don't think it made it into an episode.
[45:45.180 --> 45:45.660]  Maybe it did.
[45:45.720 --> 45:51.620]  But I showed you guys a bunch of just like weird ass sodas that I found at the fiesta.
[45:51.700 --> 45:53.000]  Yes, yeah.
[45:53.100 --> 45:56.160]  I want to buy a bunch of those and do some sort of a blind taste test.
[45:56.260 --> 45:57.920]  See if you could figure out what the fuck any of it is.
[45:58.120 --> 46:00.680]  Maybe we can do it with, maybe we can combine them.
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.180]  So are you, are you going to drink the gravy also?
[46:04.840 --> 46:05.100]  Who?
[46:05.800 --> 46:06.100]  You.
[46:06.600 --> 46:07.820]  Well, I wasn't voted on, so no.
[46:09.680 --> 46:12.740]  Okay. I mean, but you want to do the blind taste test.
[46:13.020 --> 46:14.260]  With the sodas, not with the gravy.
[46:15.040 --> 46:16.300]  They kind of go hand in hand.
[46:16.480 --> 46:16.720]  Yeah.
[46:17.240 --> 46:20.100]  They kind of really go hand in hand. Should we have a vote?
[46:20.340 --> 46:24.820]  If you want to vote for it, then we can vote for it. But until we vote for it, I don't have to do it.
[46:24.840 --> 46:26.080]  Should Jeff drink the gravy?
[46:26.260 --> 46:26.820]  I vote no.
[46:27.620 --> 46:27.840]  Yeah.
[46:28.420 --> 46:28.560]  Yeah.
[46:29.420 --> 46:29.780]  Ah!
[46:30.620 --> 46:31.600]  So how many flavors are there?
[46:32.020 --> 46:33.620]  I mean, I just don't know why you said anything.
[46:34.100 --> 46:35.360]  There are three flavors.
[46:35.400 --> 46:38.580]  I'm going to ram this fucking democracy down all your throats every chance I get.
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.400]  So yeah, maybe we should all just have a sip and we'll, we'll see the titles of each can.
[46:43.540 --> 46:44.740]  And we'll just have to guess which one we've got.
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.800]  I think that's great.
[46:45.860 --> 46:46.640]  Yeah, I love that.
[46:46.680 --> 46:47.380]  I think that's great.
[46:47.500 --> 46:48.300]  When do we do this? Tomorrow?
[46:49.420 --> 46:50.360]  Uh, yeah.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.360]  We're already playing, we're playing Gears 5 tomorrow.
[46:52.720 --> 46:54.940]  Yeah, not available tomorrow, but next week.
[46:55.300 --> 46:55.600]  Okay.
[46:55.860 --> 46:56.540]  Okay. Next week.
[46:57.100 --> 46:58.140]  We have a stream tomorrow.
[46:58.570 --> 47:00.220]  Oh, we do.
[47:00.580 --> 47:04.760]  So we stream on Fridays on Twitch, uh, at 2 p.m. Central, roughly.
[47:05.560 --> 47:06.680]  Uh, that'll, that'll come and go.
[47:06.780 --> 47:07.800]  Times will probably shift or whatever.
[47:08.060 --> 47:11.320]  Because I think I have Gracie available next Friday.
[47:11.320 --> 47:15.720]  And if we spring canned gravy taste test on Gracie, she'll do it.
[47:16.280 --> 47:17.620]  Dude, gravy Gracie?
[47:17.920 --> 47:18.220]  That's the...
[47:18.220 --> 47:19.240]  Gracie, Gracie!
[47:20.340 --> 47:24.380]  They'd be like, they used to call me Gracie Gravy back in high school.
[47:27.080 --> 47:27.980]  I don't know why.
[47:28.140 --> 47:30.680]  I feel like that's a downgrade from British Shackle.
[47:30.720 --> 47:31.500]  Yeah, I think so.
[47:31.900 --> 47:33.940]  I, well, you had something to aspire to, right?
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.700]  You start as Gracie Gravy and you work your way up to British Shackle.
[47:38.780 --> 47:43.800]  I really like the idea of somehow having these mixed in with normal sodas and
[47:43.800 --> 47:46.300]  not knowing what you're gonna get until...
[47:47.300 --> 47:49.480]  Oh, it'd be like your, the Bov thing you did?
[47:49.880 --> 47:51.340]  Yeah, like Dodge the Bov.
[47:51.720 --> 47:51.940]  Yeah.
[47:52.300 --> 47:56.460]  So it's all the weird sodas and the gravy, and so you don't know what weird soda or...
[47:56.460 --> 47:58.640]  If it's weird soda or weird gravy, all right.
[47:58.820 --> 48:01.120]  Just, yeah, it's just all cans that look the same.
[48:01.200 --> 48:03.400]  Maybe you put koozies to cover, I don't know.
[48:03.680 --> 48:04.820]  You paint the can, I don't know.
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.960]  I wonder what else interesting comes in a can.
[48:07.140 --> 48:08.740]  You'd have some sort of crazy can roulette.
[48:09.260 --> 48:10.540]  I like that idea.
[48:10.760 --> 48:11.660]  What else can we get in cans?
[48:11.740 --> 48:12.380]  Here's what we should do.
[48:12.420 --> 48:17.860]  We should have a field trip to the international food market and just go fucking hog wild.
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.560]  I love that idea.
[48:20.240 --> 48:20.540]  What?
[48:21.380 --> 48:26.160]  Rank, you guys, rank which gravy you'd want to consume the most to the least in the can.
[48:26.160 --> 48:28.080]  I'll go through the flavors right now.
[48:28.080 --> 48:31.240]  You got caramelized onion gravy with HP sauce.
[48:32.420 --> 48:34.660]  Chicken gravy is flavor two.
[48:35.320 --> 48:37.360]  Flavor three is beef gravy.
[48:38.020 --> 48:39.840]  Oh, beef's beef's going at the top for me.
[48:40.640 --> 48:42.020]  I mean, that's just bavarois, isn't it?
[48:42.060 --> 48:42.440]  Essentially.
[48:43.240 --> 48:44.380]  Oh, you might be right.
[48:45.420 --> 48:48.100]  Might be very similar, but I love her.
[48:48.160 --> 48:48.700]  I love her both.
[48:49.080 --> 48:49.920]  Are those the three?
[48:50.360 --> 48:51.160]  Those are three.
[48:51.520 --> 48:54.280]  Chicken gravy, caramelized onion gravy and beef.
[48:54.480 --> 48:54.880]  They're all good.
[48:54.880 --> 48:57.320]  I would do beef chicken caramelized probably.
[48:58.020 --> 49:01.980]  Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what the British consider chicken gravy, though.
[49:02.280 --> 49:03.920]  I'd have to I'd have to see it.
[49:04.020 --> 49:10.260]  I don't want to drink anything out of a can that has onion on the label.
[49:10.420 --> 49:11.900]  It's just a general rule.
[49:12.900 --> 49:16.220]  The fact that it's caramelized really doesn't make it any better.
[49:16.520 --> 49:22.600]  What if I spent some time in a lab and I developed an onion based drink
[49:23.140 --> 49:26.080]  and I tried to get it to the point where you would enjoy it?
[49:26.480 --> 49:29.460]  I mean, it would have to be a very sweet onion.
[49:30.120 --> 49:30.720]  They exist.
[49:30.920 --> 49:31.960]  There are sweet onions, aren't there?
[49:32.020 --> 49:32.700]  Yeah, there are.
[49:32.760 --> 49:36.980]  But like I'm saying sweeter than sweeter than sweet.
[49:37.840 --> 49:40.620]  Well, I mean, the onion is just going to be a component of it, right?
[49:40.640 --> 49:42.760]  Like he can add other sweeteners.
[49:42.940 --> 49:44.120]  Oh, this onion aid.
[49:44.240 --> 49:44.960]  That's a real thing.
[49:47.200 --> 49:52.040]  I bet that's oh, wait, Gavin, you just.
[49:52.600 --> 49:55.600]  There is so much more that this brand.
[49:55.780 --> 49:59.140]  This brand is all about cans, pots.
[49:59.800 --> 50:02.000]  Oh, it's just like shit in cans.
[50:02.120 --> 50:04.560]  It is. That is their thing, it appears.
[50:04.860 --> 50:08.700]  I just posted a link for they have cooking sauces in cans.
[50:09.180 --> 50:09.860]  Wow.
[50:10.500 --> 50:13.100]  This is enchilada sauce?
[50:13.400 --> 50:13.880]  Insane.
[50:14.460 --> 50:15.580]  What the fuck?
[50:15.840 --> 50:16.740]  Katsu curry?
[50:17.380 --> 50:20.660]  Just one is just sweet and sour.
[50:20.660 --> 50:22.500]  I would drink the sweet and sour.
[50:22.720 --> 50:25.200]  Honestly, the sweet sour can looks delicious.
[50:25.460 --> 50:26.700]  That looks like a great drink.
[50:26.960 --> 50:28.560]  We've got to get every part.
[50:28.840 --> 50:31.060]  Their design is crazy.
[50:33.720 --> 50:36.240]  Nick said I'm going sauce monkey mode.
[50:43.900 --> 50:45.140]  Fajita and taco.
[50:45.780 --> 50:48.180]  Dude, they have like liquid.
[50:48.180 --> 50:51.660]  They have like liquid death ass cans of stock.
[50:56.040 --> 50:57.160]  Fish stock.
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.300]  Oh, God, it's that's horrific.
[51:02.520 --> 51:04.000]  I want to I want to try every single one of these.
[51:07.240 --> 51:09.160]  Stock cans and gravy cans.
[51:09.340 --> 51:14.380]  I want to find more weird canned stuff, but you can honestly do the roulette game
[51:14.380 --> 51:15.540]  with just pot's products.
[51:15.740 --> 51:16.440]  There's enough.
[51:17.520 --> 51:20.400]  I'm trying to think of what would be the worst one to get.
[51:20.460 --> 51:21.820]  I think fish stock.
[51:22.100 --> 51:23.480]  Fish stock has to be up there.
[51:23.540 --> 51:28.220]  Yeah, it has to be a can of fish stock with locked in flavor.
[51:28.940 --> 51:31.560]  I think sweet and sour would be the easiest to consume.
[51:32.140 --> 51:35.620]  I think ragu would be a lot harder to drink than you think it would.
[51:35.860 --> 51:36.620]  I agree.
[51:37.440 --> 51:39.300]  It would just come out in glugs, right?
[51:39.380 --> 51:42.480]  Yeah, that's that's going to have to be a wide can hole.
[51:44.920 --> 51:50.240]  Can we do a hidden camera thing with someone where we make spaghetti
[51:50.240 --> 51:54.320]  and then go to pour the ragu sauce on and you just crack open a can?
[51:54.640 --> 51:56.760]  You crack a can and then pour it over it.
[51:56.940 --> 52:00.360]  I just want to see someone's reaction to that happening live.
[52:01.320 --> 52:02.260]  Oh, man.
[52:02.760 --> 52:03.940]  It would be so disturbing.
[52:04.760 --> 52:05.900]  This is just crazy.
[52:06.240 --> 52:08.000]  Gavin, you found a great brand.
[52:08.500 --> 52:10.380]  Yeah, I think we got to get Gracie on the cans.
[52:10.980 --> 52:11.360]  Oh, yeah.
[52:12.600 --> 52:12.920]  Yeah.
[52:14.180 --> 52:15.440]  Stuff in cans.
[52:15.580 --> 52:16.720]  So they had this shit locally.
[52:16.840 --> 52:18.440]  We can get potentially other sauces.
[52:19.180 --> 52:22.620]  Well, I only found the gravy, but yeah, I can go back and have a look.
[52:22.660 --> 52:24.180]  I mean, you can buy them from this website.
[52:24.800 --> 52:27.480]  When you go back, see if you can pick up an Onionade as well.
[52:27.600 --> 52:28.920]  I was reading about it. It sounds pretty good.
[52:29.420 --> 52:36.440]  It's an onion that scientists in Japan created to get rid of all the
[52:37.540 --> 52:39.280]  parts that make you cry and that are bitter.
[52:39.420 --> 52:40.540]  And it's just sweet.
[52:40.540 --> 52:44.540]  And then to show how sweet it is, they created Onionade to try to convince people to buy it.
[52:44.900 --> 52:45.300]  Onionade.
[52:47.200 --> 52:48.000]  Oh, man.
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.740]  This has been... this is our second episode ever for this show.
[52:53.080 --> 52:54.340]  Real, real weird one.
[52:54.740 --> 52:58.200]  One that I think people are going to call back to for like a long time.
[52:58.480 --> 53:01.000]  I think it's weird that you said it was our second episode ever.
[53:01.340 --> 53:02.360]  Yeah, this is our second episode ever.
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.200]  It started, I put episode two.
[53:04.280 --> 53:05.200]  This is our second episode ever.
[53:05.480 --> 53:06.740]  But you're like, real weird one.
[53:06.840 --> 53:09.560]  If you're adhering to that logic, we've only done two.
[53:09.560 --> 53:10.240]  Exactly.
[53:10.240 --> 53:11.520]  It's a real weird one, dude.
[53:11.680 --> 53:11.940]  That much.
[53:11.940 --> 53:14.020]  Half of these episodes have been fucking crazy.
[53:15.680 --> 53:17.040]  What is this?
[53:17.740 --> 53:18.180]  Purple stuff?
[53:18.180 --> 53:21.980]  We talked about time traveling to kill horses last episode.
[53:22.420 --> 53:23.820]  Yeah, but none of that was practical.
[53:24.360 --> 53:24.820]  None of it was.
[53:24.900 --> 53:26.020]  This has all been practical.
[53:26.280 --> 53:31.720]  This is like having a friendship egot and strong-armed democracy and fish stock in a can.
[53:31.940 --> 53:33.300]  Like this all seems like...
[53:33.300 --> 53:35.720]  This is all stuff that we can...
[53:40.040 --> 53:40.820]  Look at this.
[53:41.900 --> 53:45.760]  Purple stuff, classic, great pro-relaxation formula.
[53:45.880 --> 53:46.740]  What the hell does that mean?
[53:46.840 --> 53:47.320]  Good lord.
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.720]  Calm down, relax.
[53:48.860 --> 53:50.520]  Is that like CBD juice?
[53:50.980 --> 53:51.860]  Yeah, it's gotta be.
[53:51.960 --> 53:54.080]  What the fuck does super liminal mean?
[53:55.660 --> 53:57.060]  Oh my god.
[53:57.300 --> 53:58.820]  Super liminal.
[53:59.120 --> 54:03.060]  Like we're going subliminal with some stuff, but other stuff we're going fucking super,
[54:03.160 --> 54:04.100]  like hyperliminal.
[54:04.440 --> 54:06.260]  I think we're in our can era.
[54:06.260 --> 54:11.860]  The maximum threshold of great flavor that the human mind can grasp.
[54:12.080 --> 54:13.020]  Oh my god.
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.600]  It's a drink that is celestial rather than earthly.
[54:15.920 --> 54:17.560]  I gotta say, unpopular opinion.
[54:17.700 --> 54:20.940]  I can't... the grape flavor, it tastes like rancid shit.
[54:21.260 --> 54:24.380]  I hate whatever that fake grape is.
[54:26.040 --> 54:27.340]  I love it.
[54:27.560 --> 54:28.180]  Do you really?
[54:28.540 --> 54:29.840]  Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.
[54:30.720 --> 54:31.820]  Did you have it as a kid?
[54:31.820 --> 54:35.300]  Mmm, mmm, mmm.
[54:35.540 --> 54:40.140]  Grape cola, grapes, grapes, grape Kool-Aid, grape soda, grape, grape, grape.
[54:40.300 --> 54:42.460]  Every time, everyone looks at me like I'm crazy when I say it.
[54:42.620 --> 54:44.500]  Maybe I just didn't because I didn't grow up with that.
[54:44.880 --> 54:45.040]  Right.
[54:45.880 --> 54:50.360]  Before Jeff says grape, somebody take that audio and throw it over when he drinks the
[54:50.360 --> 54:51.620]  fish sauce, whatever.
[54:54.140 --> 54:56.540]  The fish sauce is gonna be rough.
[54:57.060 --> 54:58.420]  That's... oh, I don't like fish.
[54:59.620 --> 55:00.460]  Oh man.
[55:00.800 --> 55:01.680]  I don't like fish sauce.
[55:01.820 --> 55:03.900]  How do you get stock from the creature?
[55:06.700 --> 55:08.080]  It's bones, right?
[55:08.080 --> 55:09.520]  The use of the word creature is great.
[55:09.660 --> 55:10.360]  That's so good.
[55:10.880 --> 55:13.160]  Isn't stock just heated bone?
[55:13.520 --> 55:16.680]  So they just like take a bunch of fish bones and like melt it all down?
[55:17.260 --> 55:18.340]  I think so.
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.200]  They, you stew it, like you put it in with like water and stuff and you let it simmer
[55:23.200 --> 55:24.020]  and reduce.
[55:24.420 --> 55:28.320]  So that way it's taking on the flavor from bones and other pieces and parts.
[55:28.320 --> 55:34.880]  And then you strain it, get rid of everything that's like it, you know, inedible or whatever.
[55:35.280 --> 55:39.920]  And then you what you have left is a flavored broth.
[55:40.060 --> 55:42.140]  They don't call it like fish aid or chicken aid.
[55:42.480 --> 55:44.580]  No, they don't call it chicken aid.
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.000]  No.
[55:45.580 --> 55:50.760]  Here's a it says fish sauce is produced by blending whole oily fish such as anchovies
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.100]  or mackerel with the correct proportion of salt water and spices and then fermented for
[55:55.100 --> 55:57.640]  a period from one to 12 months before filtered.
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.640]  The end result is a clear, light brown liquid with a far more delicate flavor than the store
[56:02.640 --> 56:03.240]  bought version.
[56:03.460 --> 56:04.680]  Oh, that's if you make it at home.
[56:05.660 --> 56:09.220]  You just have like a jar of fish in your fridge for a year.
[56:09.840 --> 56:10.060]  Yeah.
[56:10.860 --> 56:11.920]  I'm gooey fish.
[56:12.280 --> 56:13.620]  That's what the image from the article is.
[56:13.660 --> 56:14.300]  Here you go.
[56:14.760 --> 56:16.200]  Wow, that looks horrific.
[56:16.360 --> 56:16.540]  Ew.
[56:17.540 --> 56:18.780]  I hate this.
[56:18.980 --> 56:21.460]  Hey, we're all we're all fucking drinking it next week.
[56:22.120 --> 56:22.180]  So.
[56:24.600 --> 56:26.000]  I fucking hate fish.
[56:26.120 --> 56:26.720]  That's so gross.
[56:26.720 --> 56:28.100]  I need to borrow your credit card, Jeff.
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.640]  I think the most disgusting thing that I like is just like tuna from a can or like sardines
[56:35.640 --> 56:36.840]  on toast like Nick.
[56:37.080 --> 56:38.160]  Just love that for some reason.
[56:38.780 --> 56:43.020]  Do you have anything that you like but is so gross you recognize it's gross so you don't
[56:43.020 --> 56:44.700]  allow yourself to eat it anymore?
[56:46.060 --> 56:47.860]  I would put bovril in that list.
[56:48.440 --> 56:48.580]  Yeah.
[56:49.160 --> 56:50.340]  For me, it's spam.
[56:50.540 --> 56:53.700]  I grew up eating spam and I cannot allow myself to eat it as an adult.
[56:53.880 --> 56:54.340]  I get that.
[56:54.340 --> 56:58.460]  I have some stuff that is I know is gross to Americans, but it's perfectly normal to
[56:58.980 --> 57:01.740]  hit me like beans on toast, baked beans on toast.
[57:01.860 --> 57:02.660]  Love it.
[57:02.660 --> 57:03.120]  Totally fine.
[57:03.160 --> 57:03.480]  That would be good.
[57:03.620 --> 57:04.960]  Nobody would have an issue with that in America.
[57:05.360 --> 57:05.800]  You sure?
[57:06.040 --> 57:07.080]  I don't know about that.
[57:07.580 --> 57:11.220]  I mean, it's weird to you, though, because wouldn't it wet the bread down?
[57:11.520 --> 57:11.920]  Oh, yeah.
[57:12.360 --> 57:14.820]  Yeah, it's I mean, I've got to tackle it quickly.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.560]  I'm not going to be walking away from it and eating it five minutes later.
[57:17.840 --> 57:20.320]  OK, but that's how I am with cereal.
[57:20.460 --> 57:23.380]  I really have to concentrate and get it all down.
[57:23.380 --> 57:25.200]  That's how I am with mozzarella sticks.
[57:25.860 --> 57:26.140]  Oh, really?
[57:26.880 --> 57:29.580]  Yeah, but after they start to cool down, they just go to shit.
[57:29.800 --> 57:31.140]  You got to eat them fucking immediately.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.740]  Yeah, you've never seen anyone eat anything as fast as I eat your Weetabix.
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.820]  Because that thing, they got about 45 seconds until they start just falling apart on the spoon.
[57:47.620 --> 57:50.720]  Just real quick before we wrap up, I want to circle back to this.
[57:51.260 --> 57:52.540]  I texted Gracie.
[57:53.820 --> 57:55.840]  Hey, would you drink gravy out of a can?
[57:56.840 --> 57:58.600]  Her reply, hell no.
[57:59.320 --> 58:01.280]  Why? Did Nick say he would?
[58:05.460 --> 58:06.620]  She knows me too well.
[58:08.800 --> 58:11.240]  I think anyone who knows you would assume that, Nick.
[58:11.240 --> 58:11.660]  That's true.
[58:11.720 --> 58:12.100]  Uh-huh.
[58:12.440 --> 58:12.820]  Fair point.
[58:12.960 --> 58:14.780]  I think that's a surface level Nick thing.
[58:16.580 --> 58:18.160]  It's what people say when they see you.
[58:18.200 --> 58:20.940]  They go, I don't know much about that guy, but I know that's the guy that drinks gravy.
[58:21.340 --> 58:21.920]  Out of a can.
[58:22.500 --> 58:24.020]  We do have a good opportunity here.
[58:24.100 --> 58:26.400]  This fish thing has just given me an idea that we should all...
[58:27.560 --> 58:33.000]  We could potentially celebrate the one-year anniversary of Regulation Podcast with some
[58:33.480 --> 58:33.840]  fermented...
[58:33.840 --> 58:34.960]  I don't want to wait that long.
[58:35.180 --> 58:35.620]  What do you mean?
[58:35.960 --> 58:37.280]  We're going to be doing it then anyway.
[58:37.420 --> 58:40.100]  How are you going to celebrate the one-year anniversary before?
[58:40.260 --> 58:41.420]  You have to wait that long.
[58:41.520 --> 58:42.480]  That's when the one-year anniversary is.
[58:42.500 --> 58:43.380]  What a ridiculous...
[58:44.280 --> 58:45.520]  So you want to be...
[58:45.520 --> 58:47.280]  I want to celebrate it now!
[58:47.620 --> 58:50.360]  We don't have a fun celebratory fermentation bit?
[58:50.760 --> 58:51.340]  You fool.
[58:51.340 --> 58:54.640]  I'm saying I don't want us to wait a year to drink the stuff.
[58:54.740 --> 58:57.200]  Not that I want us to accelerate the celebration.
[58:58.940 --> 59:01.300]  But you have to ferment fish sauce for a year.
[59:01.840 --> 59:03.060]  Yeah, but we could just buy it.
[59:03.100 --> 59:04.560]  We could just buy it in the can.
[59:05.020 --> 59:08.620]  No, but I'm saying we could all ferment something different.
[59:08.720 --> 59:09.220]  Oh, I see.
[59:09.420 --> 59:09.860]  I got it.
[59:09.880 --> 59:10.080]  Okay.
[59:10.280 --> 59:10.880]  I understand now.
[59:10.980 --> 59:11.200]  Sorry.
[59:11.420 --> 59:13.280]  I was looking at exotic sodas.
[59:13.460 --> 59:13.860]  Here's the thing.
[59:14.140 --> 59:17.720]  I don't trust any of us to ferment anything and then drink it in a year.
[59:17.840 --> 59:19.840]  It just seems like it will lead to botulism.
[59:20.100 --> 59:20.540]  Oh, yeah.
[59:20.540 --> 59:23.760]  I got some fries fermenting on my my porch.
[59:24.040 --> 59:24.400]  Okay.
[59:24.740 --> 59:25.100]  It's eight months.
[59:25.320 --> 59:29.020]  Is there like a botulade pill we can take right before we try it tomorrow?
[59:29.020 --> 59:29.260]  Oh, I guess so.
[59:29.660 --> 59:32.140]  No, botulism is a thing that like kills you kills you.
[59:32.220 --> 59:33.140]  So no, I'm not doing that.
[59:33.540 --> 59:34.260]  What did we all...
[59:34.260 --> 59:35.280]  Alright, so we're not going to do it.
[59:35.320 --> 59:36.780]  But if we did, what would we all ferment?
[59:37.960 --> 59:38.320]  Ooh.
[59:39.600 --> 59:40.200]  Hot sauce?
[59:41.080 --> 59:42.700]  Oh, that's a good one, Nick.
[59:44.180 --> 59:45.720]  Can you ferment anything?
[59:46.100 --> 59:46.820]  I assume so.
[59:47.060 --> 59:48.200]  How long does wine take?
[59:48.920 --> 59:50.760]  Uh, I mean, like a few months.
[59:51.140 --> 59:51.320]  Yeah.
[59:51.540 --> 59:53.420]  Oh, I get I mean, like fruit wine and stuff.
[59:53.480 --> 59:55.640]  Like it takes longer if you want to do different stuff.
[59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.760]  Would any fruit you ferment turn into alcohol?
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.620]  I think so.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.280]  I don't.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.680]  I mean, depending on the sugars.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.160]  Because I'd be fucked.
[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.340]  I can't be getting drunk.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:09.560]  Beets.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.480]  I'm going to ferment beets.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.020]  I bet they won't.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.160]  Beets is a good one.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.620]  I think I would do like...
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.660]  I think I would do like peppers and carrots.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.180]  Like together.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.940]  So that way you get like a spicy carrot kind of thing.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:21.620]  I like that.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.360]  How long does a pickle?
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.540]  How long?
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.740]  At least...
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.780]  I think it kind of depends, you know?
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.380]  Six months?
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.000]  Well, wait, how long was Seth Rogen in the thing?
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.000]  It was like 200 years or something.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:35.940]  I think so.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.280]  I'm going to ferment a pack of Kool-Aid gummies.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.380]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.680]  Dank Mart.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.460]  Dude, I googled weird sodas and I'm exploring...
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:49.880]  Yo, what's up?
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.080]  You guys going to Dank Mart later or what?
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.620]  Do you often shop at Dank Mart?
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.600]  I've never shopped before, but they've got my interest.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.880]  If you say so, man.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.520]  I don't know who might...
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.500]  Dankmart.ca.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.160]  So it's a Canadian mart.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.460]  Yeah.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.000]  We should wrap this one up because we got another one to do.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.060]  But this was a great one.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.380]  You can make a pickle in about three weeks.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.760]  Maybe we should have a pickle off.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:16.760]  Ooh.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.180]  Everybody make their own pickles.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.380]  See if you can make the best pickle.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.980]  Again, I don't trust any of our fermentation.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.020]  Like, I'm not doing anything that's fermenting.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.500]  I was pretty clear about that.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.340]  It's not that I don't think we couldn't learn.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.600]  It's that I don't trust us to fucking nail it the first time.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.260]  And it's botulism.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:34.940]  I just don't trust it.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.900]  I think Gus pickled and he didn't get botulism.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.460]  I think there was one he threw out for fear of botulism.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.600]  I think that could happen.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:42.780]  Right.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.160]  Jesus Christ.
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:44.720]  Wrap this up.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.120]  I like that...
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.600]  Tell people where to subscribe to us and everything, Geoff.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.280]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320]  I'm sorry, Gavin, go ahead.
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.880]  Well, I was just saying, I think we're in a much better position than we were in last week.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.360]  And thanks to all the crazy support after, well, pre-episode one and post-episode one,
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.380]  I'm so excited about the stuff that we can now do.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.200]  Like pickling things.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:07.320]  Like pickling things?
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.380]  If Eric will let us.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.140]  If democracy will allow us.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.260]  You can do it.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.560]  I'm not eating or partaking in it.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.800]  You can vote all you want.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.920]  I stand firm on this.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.020]  Can I test out the bleep?
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.000]  Firm like a pickle?
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.320]  You're gonna...
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:28.020]  Well, can we say to subscribe to us at patreon.com regulation podcast and listen to the podcast
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.160]  and check us out everywhere and now you can test the bleep?
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.100]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.700]  Is that you having said it all now?
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:34.780]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.180]  Okay.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.320]  I'm gonna test the bleep.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:37.760]  All right.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:38.700]  See if we got it back.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.140]  Okay.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:41.820]  F*** face.
