[00:00.000 --> 00:04.960]  Why are there ridges on Risa's peanut butter cups? Probably so they never slip from her hands.
[00:05.200 --> 00:09.080]  Could you imagine? I'd lose it. Luckily, Risa's thought about that.
[00:09.700 --> 00:13.600]  Wonder what else they think about? Probably chocolate and peanut butter.
[00:14.860 --> 00:19.220]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 62.
[00:19.580 --> 00:24.280]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Eric, uh, what? Eric Baddour, Nick Schwartz,
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.640]  Andrew Patton, Gavin Frey.
[00:27.800 --> 00:30.480]  Didn't want me to be first. That's fine. I understand. It's okay.
[00:30.600 --> 00:33.380]  Nah, I just, uh, just got a little tongue-tied. You know, I'm still,
[00:33.560 --> 00:38.780]  I didn't get tongue-tied. I got tongue-tired. I'm still, uh, this is five minutes since the last
[00:38.780 --> 00:42.200]  recording we did where I'm still exhausted from my kerfuffle.
[00:42.680 --> 00:46.900]  The man just saw an exotic bird. He needs to gather himself. Give him a break.
[00:48.900 --> 00:50.780]  Yeah, I'm still flummoxed from the bird.
[00:50.780 --> 00:54.100]  Mm-hmm. Did you just look at the photo and go, enhance,
[00:54.700 --> 00:59.860]  enhance? We gotta, ugh, break this down. Do you feel like your brain gets tired before
[00:59.860 --> 01:05.340]  your body? Like, I feel like my, my ability to speak breaks down before my ability to run.
[01:05.760 --> 01:10.220]  Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, it didn't used to be the case, but yeah, for sure. Are you running a lot?
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.120]  Uh, that's a good point. I mean, not, not in this weather.
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.800]  Next time you start feeling a little sleepy, maybe like brain tired,
[01:21.460 --> 01:28.600]  just get up, just run as fast as you can, and then see if maybe it'll wake you up. Maybe it'll kind
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.860]  of equilibrium a little bit. Yeah, then try to have a conversation, see how smart you sound.
[01:32.520 --> 01:36.800]  Run as fast as you can to Meg. Now I just can't speak, but also I'm panting.
[01:38.660 --> 01:43.240]  I wish I could do stuff in my brain, because I find that my eyes get tired first.
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.060]  That like, I want to do things, but then my eyes get tired, and so I have to close my eyes,
[01:49.180 --> 01:52.360]  but I'm not sleepy, but I don't want to open my eyes because my eyes are tired.
[01:52.900 --> 01:56.780]  Do you ever think about how when you pant, Andrew, you're panting panting?
[01:58.980 --> 02:02.380]  Maybe you will next time. Yeah, close your eyes and see if you can picture it.
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.860]  I'm picturing it, but that involves me. I'm thinking of pants. What if you were panting
[02:07.860 --> 02:12.560]  with your pants on? Yeah, that's never happening. Pants on, panting, panting.
[02:14.060 --> 02:17.900]  That was honestly the biggest issue I was thinking about when we're talking about jumping out of the
[02:17.900 --> 02:23.260]  plane and it being cold. I'm not, I'm not putting pants on for that. We're going to have to find a
[02:23.260 --> 02:29.020]  short solution. You're going to, even with like, maybe new technology that would keep you warm at
[02:29.020 --> 02:33.920]  33,000 feet or whatever, you're still a shorts guy? I think it would have to be a long sock
[02:33.920 --> 02:37.100]  situation because I'm okay with long socks, but I just don't want the pants.
[02:37.460 --> 02:45.120]  Would you wear pants at my funeral? No. What if, what if it was just one request? He's dead. Like,
[02:48.280 --> 02:53.240]  it's a request. Do you think if you get married someday, you'll, you'll wear pants at your
[02:53.240 --> 03:01.500]  wedding? No. Do you, when you go to the doctor, do you wear pants? No. I feel like the doctor is
[03:01.500 --> 03:06.120]  a pants on situation. I don't know why it's always hot in Austin, but I will put on a pair of pants
[03:06.120 --> 03:12.500]  to go to the doctor. Nah, shorts. Yeah, you gotta get comfy. I don't understand the doctor thing.
[03:14.100 --> 03:17.600]  Whenever I go anything that this seems important or official, I feel like I need to,
[03:17.920 --> 03:21.860]  I can't look like I'm wearing swim trunks. I don't know. Oh, those are fancy. Eric is
[03:21.860 --> 03:27.160]  posting Pharrell in shorts. Those are some fancy shorts. The one that I always think of is LeBron
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.940]  when, uh, when I film promos for this, uh, for AAPW, the wrestling company, when it's too hot,
[03:33.020 --> 03:37.020]  I'm wearing shorts, but then I put on a suit jacket, like the upper half or whatever. And I
[03:37.020 --> 03:40.840]  walk around and I just tell everyone I'm LeBron. The interesting thing about LeBron there is that
[03:40.840 --> 03:53.420]  those are actually full-size pants. Do you wear hoodies, Andrew? No, I guess not. So you wear
[03:53.420 --> 04:00.520]  t-shirts? T-shirts, yeah. T-shirt shorts. Okay. So do you have a jacket sometimes? I don't know
[04:00.520 --> 04:05.340]  if I own a jacket right now. This is how it's going to be at Gavin's funeral. Gavin, your funeral
[04:05.340 --> 04:09.460]  is going to be Andrew shaped, dressed like that. How, okay, let's, you know what, how would you
[04:09.460 --> 04:14.600]  like me to be dressed at your funeral, Gavin? Oh, however you want. You, I mean, you, you won't go
[04:14.600 --> 04:23.400]  though. Well, no, I would go. Oh, where is it? Why did he say it? He said it. No, no, no. You
[04:23.400 --> 04:31.790]  Where is it? Where is it? I'm there. I'm there. Buddy, I'm there. Where does everybody want to
[04:31.790 --> 04:36.850]  have their funeral? Oh, that's a good question. Uh, 33,000 feet in the air and everyone has to
[04:36.850 --> 04:41.210]  jump out. Okay. There you go. That's how we spread your ashes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's fine.
[04:43.230 --> 04:49.830]  How many ashes do you become? Like how many ash pieces? Oh, like how many, but I mean,
[04:49.830 --> 04:57.690]  like how many pounds of ash do you become? Well, it's going nuts. Which one? Fat boy.
[04:58.850 --> 05:05.510]  Four and six pounds. So would that be like a million pieces? Like, I wonder who's been spread
[05:05.510 --> 05:13.530]  the most. It's a good question. Like if you could have one little ash nug of your favorite
[05:13.530 --> 05:19.890]  celebrity, would you have it? No, no. Would you? I don't think so.
[05:23.530 --> 05:29.710]  Having an ash nug is below buying bathwater, I feel like. You wouldn't want like a little,
[05:30.130 --> 05:33.550]  it'd be a little ash nug on a piece of tape in a frame.
[05:35.990 --> 05:39.740]  Is it numbered? Is it like a card? Is it like one out of...
[05:40.740 --> 05:45.700]  If you could tell me what part of the celebrity it was, like you got a little piece of his right
[05:45.700 --> 05:54.100]  hand, maybe. I don't know where the ash was a part of. Okay. And like if it was the reason they
[05:54.100 --> 06:03.500]  were famous? Oh, interesting. Like if you could have Howard Stern's throat? Yeah, yeah. Like
[06:03.500 --> 06:07.660]  having Howard Stern's elbow means nothing to me, but having a little bit of Howard Stern's throat,
[06:07.660 --> 06:16.940]  yeah, sure. This is psychotic. I'm just imagining. Now, I don't like any of the
[06:16.940 --> 06:21.600]  ideas of like what I would associate Howard Stern with as far as what he's famous for.
[06:21.960 --> 06:29.140]  I assume you're not meant to mail people, like ash people. Ash people? Well, just like you're
[06:29.140 --> 06:32.960]  not meant to... I assume you can't just stick an urn in the mail, can you? No, you definitely can.
[06:33.680 --> 06:41.940]  You can? Yeah, you can, you can mail ashes. Oh. You definitely can. You can't just fucking,
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.480]  you can't get like an envelope and pour them just in it loose. Like, that's what I was thinking.
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.760]  Like, surely if you pour, if you just put one ash nug in an envelope,
[06:54.320 --> 06:59.380]  they, it's not, I don't think they'd mind. I don't know how you would...
[07:00.460 --> 07:06.260]  Cremated remains must be shipped using Priority Mail Express or Priority Mail Express International.
[07:07.240 --> 07:16.670]  No other services permitted. Yeah. Surprising.
[07:21.230 --> 07:26.010]  That's how I send Andrew his paychecks every month, it's Priority Mail International.
[07:28.150 --> 07:32.050]  So if I wanted to, I could sprinkle some Gavin or somebody in there, it'd be totally fine.
[07:32.710 --> 07:36.110]  Well, that's what I was thinking. Maybe you've already mailed someone that you just didn't know.
[07:36.110 --> 07:39.730]  Like if they were just caught on the wind when you were sealing up an envelope. Caught on the wind.
[07:40.130 --> 07:42.330]  Well, if people are scattering stuff into the air.
[07:44.050 --> 07:46.550]  Well, that could let a piece of person land on you at some point.
[07:46.970 --> 07:49.590]  Then that means you probably have breathed the person at some point.
[07:49.770 --> 07:53.510]  Yeah, it's just, what, just carbon. Have I ever breathed the person? I don't think I have.
[07:54.130 --> 07:59.590]  You wouldn't know. No, but I'm trying to think of scenarios. I, maybe. You're trying to think
[07:59.590 --> 08:04.590]  of like, if you've been Lebowski'd. I definitely would know if I've been Lebowski'd, but I'm just
[08:04.590 --> 08:09.630]  trying to think of like, I feel like when you get ashes, they're pretty secure. And I've never
[08:09.630 --> 08:16.190]  been around an open urn. So, the particles are everywhere. I told you guys that story about how
[08:16.190 --> 08:21.930]  my mom Lebowski'd that family with my dad, right? It sounds vaguely familiar, but the fact that I
[08:21.930 --> 08:27.750]  don't immediately know makes me feel like you know. Fucking brutal, dude. My dad, we had my dad's
[08:27.750 --> 08:33.990]  ashes. God, dad. And he loved the ocean. He loved the beach. And so my mom was like, I want to take
[08:33.990 --> 08:39.330]  and spread his ashes. Oh, no. I think I was at Gulf Shores, maybe. She's like, I want to take and
[08:39.330 --> 08:44.410]  spread his ashes off the pier. And then you get up there and there's signs that are like, you can't
[08:44.410 --> 08:49.670]  do this. You need a permit. And it was like, we were like, oh, fuck. And so, I guess it's something
[08:49.670 --> 08:52.270]  that happens a lot. We started reading about it on my phone and they're like, yeah, it's hyper
[08:52.270 --> 08:56.510]  illegal. And so, you got to have like a permit or something to do it. And my mom goes, we're not,
[08:56.810 --> 09:00.570]  I don't want to do that. Let's just, let's just do it where nobody will see. So, instead of throwing
[09:00.570 --> 09:05.910]  him off the edge of the pier, she's like, we'll just go under the pier. And so, we go under the
[09:05.910 --> 09:09.870]  pier. And my mom just walks out to the water. She rolls her legs up. She walks out into the water
[09:09.870 --> 09:14.190]  a little bit and she just takes the box and like throws it in the air. And like my grandma's there
[09:14.190 --> 09:21.130]  and she's upset. You know, a little bummed. And, you know, my mom's slinging ashes. And as she
[09:21.130 --> 09:27.790]  does it, we hear a, and I look over and there's a family walking in the water towards us, like a mom
[09:27.790 --> 09:33.110]  and a dad. And the dad's holding a kid in his arm and the mom is like holding another kid's hand.
[09:33.230 --> 09:39.050]  And they see it coming and they just all huddle together and they like shield the kid. And they
[09:39.050 --> 09:44.090]  got dusted by my dad and like maybe 15 feet to the right of us. And we just booked it out of there.
[09:44.530 --> 09:49.090]  Oh my god. We just booked it the fuck out of there. Well, you know, he loved the water. He loved
[09:49.090 --> 09:56.250]  families. Yeah, he was a big family man, so yeah. Oh my god. She fly-tipped your dad.
[09:59.870 --> 10:03.330]  Ironically, that's probably the best thing my dad could have asked for. Like if he thought
[10:03.330 --> 10:07.510]  that was an option, he would have chosen that. My dad was a, you know, he was a prankster.
[10:09.710 --> 10:16.330]  He had a sense of humor. Has anyone been buried as ashes? Get cremated,
[10:16.790 --> 10:20.750]  pour all the ashes in the coffin, and then in the coffin burial.
[10:22.510 --> 10:28.910]  Best of both worlds? Best of both worlds. Probably just vampires, you know? Oh man,
[10:29.070 --> 10:34.310]  yeah. That's a good call. I just, I can't imagine an open casket where the person's
[10:34.310 --> 10:39.890]  been cremated ahead of time. I think what I want, take my head off, right? Um,
[10:40.270 --> 10:44.050]  just get all the flesh out, cremate the rest of me, put it in the skull.
[10:45.530 --> 10:52.410]  Oh my god. Interesting. Oh wow, that's, wow. I don't want your, uh. What about like your,
[10:52.410 --> 10:56.130]  your eye hole sockets and stuff? Yeah, it wouldn't hold. Does any, do you think any,
[10:56.910 --> 11:00.630]  or you're not, like do you think anything's gonna leak out? Well I think a raccoon could,
[11:00.810 --> 11:04.950]  a raccoon could just come and eat those, right? So that shouldn't be a problem. Why would a raccoon
[11:04.950 --> 11:08.490]  have access to my skull? I don't know, I just figure it's like Jeff's serial killer. Like
[11:08.490 --> 11:12.130]  it would just come in, eat your brains, eat your eyes, and then like leave you for your ashes.
[11:12.130 --> 11:15.730]  Why would it have access to your skull? Because it's hanging out in your attic with all the
[11:15.730 --> 11:19.130]  squirrels and snakes? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, you're full, it's full of squirrels and snakes
[11:19.130 --> 11:26.170]  now. Yeah, I had a, I had a snake. I can't come, I can't come back to your house. Wait, what?
[11:26.430 --> 11:29.470]  I can't come back to your house. You had a snake? I can't come back to your house. I can't believe
[11:29.470 --> 11:33.150]  it happened after Jeff brought it up too. I couldn't believe it. You sent that video and
[11:33.150 --> 11:37.810]  I just went, well you shouldn't have done that. I swear in a recent podcast, I said that I rarely
[11:37.810 --> 11:41.890]  see snakes, but I did just see one, so I'm probably not going to see one for another 10 years. Yeah,
[11:41.890 --> 11:48.470]  it was like the next day. It was in my snake follows thing I was talking about. Yeah, I can't
[11:48.470 --> 11:54.230]  post this public because it's literally on the front of my house, but I can show you a lot. Oh,
[11:54.270 --> 12:04.250]  I need nitro. Put it in Slack. Put it in Slack. It freaked Jeff out. Jeff was not happy. It was
[12:04.250 --> 12:08.670]  right after Jeff had talked about how he'd seen a snake. I know, I was talking about how I'd
[12:08.670 --> 12:15.290]  realized that every day I'm getting closer to seeing a snake in person, and that every decision
[12:15.290 --> 12:21.230]  I and the snake or its parents make is putting us closer to intersecting, and I'm not jazzed
[12:21.230 --> 12:27.130]  about that. Okay, so we got a snake situation. Oh, it's climbing up. It's big. That is an
[12:27.130 --> 12:31.450]  intimidating snake. How many feet do you think that snake is? Three feet? Four feet? Probably,
[12:31.450 --> 12:38.270]  eleven. And it crawled up the side of the house, and then I lost track of it.
[12:38.950 --> 12:43.270]  It didn't lose track of you. I don't like losing track of that. Why? What do you mean? Lost track?
[12:43.370 --> 12:46.950]  Just get up in that attic with the squirrels and go have a look. And he's up there. It probably
[12:46.950 --> 12:55.010]  is after them. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Or, like I was telling you, it's just going home from work
[12:55.010 --> 12:59.730]  after a long day of snake job, and it just wants to fucking chill in front of snake TV with its
[12:59.730 --> 13:04.190]  wife and kids in your attic where it lives in its snake community with all the other snakes that
[13:04.190 --> 13:08.090]  are right above your head at all times. You think I was just hearing the snakes the whole time?
[13:08.470 --> 13:12.570]  Oh, God. Well, I think you heard the snakes eating the squirrels the whole time. Yeah.
[13:12.830 --> 13:17.990]  I got pest control coming today. Thank you. God. Oh, my God. Did you let them know that it's snakes?
[13:18.870 --> 13:23.490]  Uh. Oh, boy. Well, that wasn't in my original email because it hadn't happened yet.
[13:25.730 --> 13:29.070]  Probably let the guy know so he knows what he's getting into. What about the squirrel?
[13:29.070 --> 13:34.490]  Did they take care of the squirrels? The people haven't come yet? Uh, they haven't. Do you still
[13:34.490 --> 13:39.750]  have them? Well, that's why he has a snake now, dude. It's coming after his squirrels. Yeah. You
[13:39.750 --> 13:44.550]  send in a spider to get the fly. Maybe he'll die. Pretty soon there's going to be a gorilla climbing
[13:44.550 --> 13:49.150]  up there to eat the hyena that was there to eat the fucking snake that's there to eat the squirrels.
[13:49.990 --> 13:55.210]  Gavin's house is just slowly turning into an ark. It's just going to be every animal is going to
[13:55.210 --> 14:00.170]  exist. There's going to be one of every animal skeleton and then the largest animal will be
[14:00.170 --> 14:08.930]  alive. I'm imagining your cremated skeleton skull thing. That's the skull skeleton. What did I? I
[14:08.930 --> 14:14.570]  had another one. Anyway, I I would only be OK with it if you put these googly eyes where the eye
[14:14.570 --> 14:20.490]  sockets are. I'm greatly disturbed. But then when I imagine seeing that, but those little googly
[14:20.490 --> 14:25.790]  sticker eyes, I would be OK with it. Well, the skull would have to be upside down, surely?
[14:26.490 --> 14:35.050]  I think you just have to seal it somehow. Seal my under face? Maybe it's in like a
[14:35.790 --> 14:42.370]  under skull. I don't know what that's called. Searching for googly eyes on human skull does
[14:42.370 --> 14:48.110]  not produce that, but it does produce a lot of other really weird things. I'm sure. Oh,
[14:48.110 --> 14:52.530]  interesting. So you have pest control coming for the snake or is it unrelated?
[14:53.130 --> 14:57.810]  For the squirrels. The squirrels. Yeah. So they're coming today for the squirrels.
[14:57.910 --> 15:02.490]  For whatever's in my ceiling. Yeah, they're coming today for the squirrels, but they're
[15:02.490 --> 15:05.930]  going to be really excited when they see it's full of snakes. Yeah. What are you
[15:05.930 --> 15:09.090]  going to do with it? Like, could I have got a snake down? I think it would have
[15:09.090 --> 15:14.430]  tried to choke me. No, you leave the snake. If there's a snake climbing up my house,
[15:14.470 --> 15:17.910]  I'm getting it off my fucking house. I'm spraying it with a hose until it gets off.
[15:17.910 --> 15:24.410]  You think the snake would have tried to choke you? Locking that rear naked? I assume it's
[15:24.410 --> 15:28.250]  a constricting snake. I also think that it would try to choke him or eat him. Yeah.
[15:28.790 --> 15:32.210]  Like, how big does a snake... I'm sure a four foot snake could choke me out.
[15:32.990 --> 15:36.090]  Yeah, I don't think it's going to try. I don't think that's the intent though.
[15:36.550 --> 15:41.470]  No, I don't think that's what the snake does. It wants to bite a hole and then crawl into
[15:41.470 --> 15:50.030]  like a tauntaun and then stay there. It constricts me from the inside. It just goes in and squeezes
[15:50.030 --> 15:55.830]  my heart. It's like Keanu Reeves in the second Matrix movie. Now that would be the greatest
[15:55.830 --> 16:01.690]  betrayal of all for Jeff. If Gavin got replaced by a snake and we've been doing a podcast with
[16:01.690 --> 16:06.130]  Gavin Snake for the past however many episodes. I would be so... send us a picture of your tongue.
[16:09.950 --> 16:11.890]  It's like the thing, but just tongue checks.
[16:14.050 --> 16:18.710]  Stick the tongue out. You're not a snake man. Good.
[16:22.230 --> 16:26.010]  Making everyone do it through like a nest camera before they're allowed in your house.
[16:26.450 --> 16:29.630]  Do you remember when I bought us a bunch of tongue sleeves? What was that for?
[16:29.990 --> 16:33.930]  Oh, that's a bit barrel thing. And I also don't know where they are. I don't know what happened
[16:33.930 --> 16:38.150]  to them. I have to buy more. Were we going to eat stuff without tasting it? I don't remember.
[16:38.290 --> 16:41.750]  Oh, that was what it was. We were going to see what it would be like if our finger buds were
[16:41.750 --> 16:46.670]  on our hands. So we were going to put put whatever was inside the tongue sleeve. And then that would
[16:46.670 --> 16:50.970]  be how maybe that was. That's right. We'll throw it in the bit barrel and then the audience will
[16:50.970 --> 16:55.310]  tell us. Or maybe we could put garlic on our feet and lick stuff with the tongue sleeve and see if
[16:55.310 --> 16:59.350]  it really tastes like garlic. Spin around in a circle three times. Yeah, it's good.

[18:47.810 --> 18:52.890]  Speaking of, uh, I don't know, speaking of fucking changing the subject.
[18:54.870 --> 19:00.490]  I promote this at the end of the last episode. A couple of weeks ago now in real time,
[19:00.610 --> 19:05.950]  maybe four or five episodes ago, we discussed what a regulation popcorn bucket would be.
[19:06.010 --> 19:09.650]  And then we decided it would be funny if we made a porta putty. Porta putty?
[19:10.150 --> 19:15.030]  Porta putty. My brain, my brain's too tired. I could probably run really fast right now.
[19:15.030 --> 19:18.190]  I can't talk shit. Hit the pavement.
[19:18.790 --> 19:23.430]  Uh, we talked about making a porta potty popcorn bucket, which we all thought was hilarious.
[19:23.430 --> 19:29.790]  And then we we talked to Natalie and we set them in motion just to see if it's feasible.
[19:30.210 --> 19:36.370]  And they came back with an eight inch, which is about the standard size, porta potty pop up.
[19:36.450 --> 19:38.350]  What? Popcorn bucket. God.
[19:38.490 --> 19:41.710]  Dude, hand off the baton. What are you doing?
[19:41.710 --> 19:49.530]  And we want to see if the audience is actually interested in it, if this is the thing that we
[19:49.530 --> 19:55.390]  should actually pursue, or if this is one of those ideas that's funny to talk about, but not
[19:55.390 --> 20:00.050]  actually make. This thing would probably cost in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 dollars. I've put some
[20:00.050 --> 20:07.690]  images up. I've actually put the same image up twice somehow in our Discord. Of the porba puppy?
[20:07.690 --> 20:14.130]  Oh, man. Of the porba puppy. Is this something that you as an audience would buy
[20:15.170 --> 20:21.390]  genuinely? Because we would probably have to make at least a thousand of them, which seems like
[20:21.390 --> 20:27.490]  a lot to make. But the porta potty is pink. The top comes off. You can fill it with popcorn.
[20:27.990 --> 20:32.690]  Inside the porta potty is a normal toilet. Not a porta potty toilet, but a small,
[20:32.690 --> 20:37.510]  normal toilet that opens up and can hold one popcorn kernel, like Gavin requested.
[20:37.790 --> 20:42.890]  On the top of the popcorn lid, or on the top of the toilet lid, would be the regulation butthole
[20:42.890 --> 20:48.210]  logo. Is this something you as a customer, as a regulation listener, or a comment leaver...
[20:48.210 --> 20:51.610]  I guess we'll never know for the regulation listeners, so it's only to the comment leavers.
[20:52.310 --> 20:56.630]  Will you buy this? Should we make this? Is this something you actually want to own,
[20:56.690 --> 21:00.770]  or is this a bad idea like the slop-a-clock clock that we're going to have to figure out how to get
[21:00.770 --> 21:05.290]  rid of $1,200? I mean, it's obviously a bad idea. It's just a popcorn bucket that's horrifically
[21:05.290 --> 21:10.090]  difficult to clean. I would definitely get one though. Yeah, I showed it to Bernie and Vanessa
[21:10.090 --> 21:14.950]  and they were like, I'd pay 40 bucks for that tomorrow. So I was like, I was thinking like,
[21:15.010 --> 21:18.790]  maybe not. Like, maybe we don't do this. Maybe it's like, it's dumb. And then Bernie and Vanessa
[21:18.790 --> 21:21.390]  were like, I was like, what are you guys thinking? They're like, I want one yesterday. And I was
[21:21.390 --> 21:24.730]  like, seriously? And they're like, yeah, I would pay. I would pay good money for that tomorrow.
[21:24.970 --> 21:28.470]  So I think it's just a cool prop, like you wouldn't have to use it. Yeah, I'm looking at it.
[21:28.470 --> 21:33.850]  I'm thinking that that would be a great urn. I think that's where I'm going. Oh, popcorn bucket
[21:33.850 --> 21:40.230]  slash urn! Shouldn't we sell it as a slash urn? Is there some sort of tax break we can get from
[21:40.230 --> 21:49.510]  being an urn? Can you sell an urn? I don't think, I don't think typically urns are sold as also
[21:49.510 --> 21:53.810]  edible like things. Well, it's whatever you want it to be. Things that store edible food.
[21:54.190 --> 21:57.890]  If you decide when you first use it, what it's going to be used for. I guess any container can
[21:57.890 --> 22:03.050]  be an urn. Yeah, even a Folgers can. I feel like that'd be such, that'd be such like if there was
[22:03.050 --> 22:10.910]  a new Elvira movie at Alamo, it'd be an urn popcorn bucket. That's really, I didn't think about putting
[22:10.910 --> 22:14.610]  ashes in it, but I guess you could. And then you could just put the top on and never take it off
[22:14.610 --> 22:19.830]  or take it off and talk with your loved one. I'm not really sure. I was, I was thinking about like
[22:19.830 --> 22:28.350]  the worst chase thing would be like one Gerpol, Gerpler was filled with ash, with ashes, like a
[22:28.350 --> 22:34.630]  popcorn bucket where there's one in Gavin's philosophy or like his great ash kernel or
[22:34.630 --> 22:39.350]  whatever. There's one in the toilet. Got to check your toilet to see if you got a singular ash piece.
[22:39.850 --> 22:43.650]  There's just like a little piece of bone that didn't quite get burned.
[22:43.650 --> 22:49.990]  That's horrible. Nasty. Well, let us know in the comments, if this is something that
[22:49.990 --> 22:54.770]  seems like something you would want. I actually have something I wanted to bring up and
[22:55.650 --> 23:01.490]  this was pitched to me by our friend Alyssa and I've been kind of sitting on it, but I think it's
[23:01.490 --> 23:08.170]  a good idea and it's something I want to explore. I just don't know how to explore it. I feel like
[23:08.170 --> 23:12.970]  we're sometimes in outdoors podcasts, especially when Jeff is on a bike, seeing a snake, being
[23:12.970 --> 23:17.270]  afraid of a snake, but you have to do that when you're out in public, right? You got to be in
[23:17.270 --> 23:21.130]  these public areas and sometimes it gets, sometimes you get too tired. Sometimes you get too hot.
[23:21.230 --> 23:26.990]  Sometimes you just need to have a seat. What was pitched to me, and I think we should do, is we
[23:26.990 --> 23:33.390]  should do commemorative benches. We should get commemorative benches around the United States.
[23:33.710 --> 23:42.950]  So that way everyone knows, have a regulation seat in the park and just kind of hang out. There's a
[23:42.950 --> 23:49.350]  talk to different cities, but imagine that the second picture that I sent is a dog and he's
[23:49.350 --> 23:54.950]  hanging out on a memorial bench with a bunch of memorial things on it. That's it. Some of these
[23:54.950 --> 24:00.150]  are just bench sponsorships and not dedicated to people who died, which I'm sure a lot of people
[24:00.150 --> 24:06.030]  think that's what it is normally. So just a regulation bench. I think it's great. We should
[24:06.030 --> 24:13.090]  try and put 50 regulation benches down in America, one in each state. And the challenge is to sit on
[24:13.090 --> 24:18.830]  each one. I think we got to have a regulation bench in every state and we have to physically
[24:18.830 --> 24:25.190]  sit on it and do a podcast from it. Could the first one be a deputy? Well, that's sort of where
[24:25.190 --> 24:29.450]  my mind is going with this. Right, right. But I just don't know. I don't know if deputy has any
[24:29.450 --> 24:35.390]  parks or benches. No, that's a that's a struggle for sure. I'm a removed deputy.
[24:35.610 --> 24:39.970]  What if? Because there's there's one bench in this photo that you're listing that has multiple
[24:39.970 --> 24:47.550]  things on it. If we lock down a bench and then whoever wins face off gets to put a thing on
[24:47.550 --> 24:52.510]  that bench. And it's like the Stanley Cup where like the team gets engraved onto the thing. But
[24:52.510 --> 24:57.190]  the prize every season is you get to add an engravement of your choice to the bench.
[24:57.190 --> 25:03.650]  So like our trophy, our trophy each year is just a plaque on the bench that people can sit on.
[25:04.010 --> 25:08.390]  And and every year we'll put a new plaque on for the winners. Yes. The winner gets to pick what
[25:08.390 --> 25:13.770]  the plaque is for that bench. And we just keep adding as we do seasons. I also think we can
[25:13.770 --> 25:17.530]  absolutely do the bench and deputy. I think we go to Home Depot when we buy a bench, we put the
[25:17.530 --> 25:22.390]  plaque on ourselves and we just drop it somewhere in deputy Indiana. We do the podcast, then we
[25:22.390 --> 25:26.930]  leave it and we see if it stays. I like everything about everybody's idea. And I think this is
[25:26.930 --> 25:32.650]  because we pitched an idea a while back called Hide and Speak, where we do podcasts in public
[25:32.650 --> 25:38.070]  where people can't see us. Remember? Talked about kind of like what we did with with the Halo video,
[25:38.270 --> 25:43.110]  with Gavin's Halo video, where he showed us where he and he would hide and hit on girls.
[25:44.850 --> 25:50.250]  Playing Halo. It's one girl. It's kind of like that. It's an old idea. It's on the sheets idea.
[25:50.310 --> 25:54.330]  But anyway, I love this idea because I've been wanting to do podcasts outside anyway. And I
[25:54.330 --> 26:01.390]  love I love the idea of commemorating. I like I like to sit big sitter. I think this is awesome.
[26:01.450 --> 26:07.170]  That is not a comfortable bench. No, but it does say class of 1973, quote, Don't stop thinking
[26:07.170 --> 26:11.710]  about tomorrow, Fleetwood Mac. So we can get whatever we want on a bench. Apparently, you
[26:11.710 --> 26:18.830]  guys want to hear a somber bench dedication story. I guess if it's too dark, we can cut it from the
[26:18.830 --> 26:29.450]  episode. A couple years ago, a couple years ago in Austin at Millie's pediatrician office,
[26:30.750 --> 26:35.810]  a guy came in. You know what? Listen, I'm not gonna tell this story.
[26:37.690 --> 26:40.750]  As soon as you started saying it, I went, yeah, we shouldn't include this.
[26:41.050 --> 26:44.270]  Yeah, never mind. I'm not gonna tell the story. Why don't we put on Patreon if you want to be
[26:44.270 --> 26:54.370]  bummed out? You can leave out the beginning part maybe. I feel like it's integral. It is
[26:54.370 --> 27:02.510]  kind of integral. So a guy who was mentally ill went into a pediatrician's office in Austin
[27:02.510 --> 27:08.210]  and took them hostage. The doctors that worked there, an all woman pediatrician's office. And
[27:08.210 --> 27:13.330]  then he ended up killing one of them and then committing suicide. It was Millie's pediatrician's
[27:13.330 --> 27:16.570]  office, but not her pediatrician. Anyway, it was a big deal in Austin. It was heartbreaking.
[27:17.110 --> 27:22.130]  It was really sad. It was terrible in every way. And then Emily and I were in San Francisco
[27:23.830 --> 27:27.410]  for something. I don't even remember what. This is like two years later. And we went to a park
[27:27.410 --> 27:32.150]  and we sat down at a bench to look at the view. And the bench was dedicated to the doctor who got
[27:32.150 --> 27:38.030]  killed. That's great. In Austin. No, her brother lived in San Francisco and wanted to do something
[27:38.030 --> 27:41.690]  to commemorate her. So he bought the bench and commemorated for her. And it was just wild that
[27:41.690 --> 27:46.130]  two years later we sat on a random bench on the other side of the country that happened to be
[27:46.130 --> 27:50.970]  dedicated to this person. I don't think I've ever been as out on a story in the first half and then
[27:50.970 --> 27:56.650]  as in the second half, Jeff. That was impressive. When you started that, I was like, what world is
[27:56.650 --> 28:01.730]  this a good story to share? And you really pulled me in. That's a crazy coincidence. Yeah, it was
[28:01.730 --> 28:05.150]  just like just one of those things where you're like, how is that possible that we sat on this
[28:05.150 --> 28:10.390]  particular bench out of all the benches, even in this park, let alone in the city of San Francisco?
[28:10.390 --> 28:19.150]  Yeah, that's crazy. That's wild. Yeah. I have had an interesting life change with pillow mountain.
[28:19.610 --> 28:25.550]  I've expanded. We've got a whole new layer of pillow mountain. You got nine pillows now? No,
[28:26.010 --> 28:31.890]  it's not about height. Oh, it's a whole new layer. Did you get king size pillows or something? Are
[28:31.890 --> 28:37.870]  you going wider? No, I have. I already have a few of those, but no, it's what I'm doing is I'm
[28:37.870 --> 28:45.190]  burrowing into the mountain now. We got a whole new game. What do you got? So I used to be someone
[28:45.190 --> 28:50.370]  who didn't like sleeping with like a blanket or like anything over their face. The air would get
[28:50.370 --> 28:55.190]  hot. It was unpleasant. You don't put the blanket over your face. Who sleeps with a blanket over
[28:55.190 --> 28:59.610]  their face? Well, just, you know, like if you're you're laying under the blankets and it's like a
[28:59.610 --> 29:04.570]  blanket fort or situation or what I just didn't like. I'm not like wrapping a blanket around my
[29:04.570 --> 29:08.450]  face and then trying to sleep. But like if you're underneath. Yeah, that way. Yeah. Why would you
[29:08.450 --> 29:16.750]  think that? You must be insane, Gavin. Anyway, I realized that with my CPAP machine, it's really
[29:16.750 --> 29:23.030]  just like a breathing thing and I'm not getting air from my nose directly. It's exterior air.
[29:23.410 --> 29:29.390]  So I've been burrowing in because I like the weight of the thing on top of me and I'm not
[29:29.390 --> 29:33.250]  dealing with the hot air because the air is coming from somewhere else. I'm getting external air.
[29:33.250 --> 29:41.070]  I feel like I'm like above ground scuba diving, like non-water scuba diving with this thing on.
[29:41.130 --> 29:47.390]  It's great. I've been burrowing. Where does all the carbon dioxide you expel go in a CPAP? I've
[29:47.390 --> 29:51.950]  never thought about that. Does it take it out too or do there vents? OK, yeah, there's like a vent
[29:51.950 --> 29:56.430]  in the front. Are you just creating under your under your blankets a situation that Gavin is
[29:56.430 --> 30:01.510]  dealing with with his cats in his office? I don't think so. Well, yeah, you would be increasing the
[30:01.510 --> 30:08.010]  carbon dioxide in the in the trapped air area, but you're still getting regular air through the nose hole.
[30:08.010 --> 30:12.730]  I guess that's true. Yeah, I'm getting I mean, we're cranking the pressure. It's the it's jetting.
[30:13.350 --> 30:19.030]  It's great. Did you say carbon monoxide? Who? What? Did Jeff say carbon monoxide? Oh, yeah, I did.
[30:19.710 --> 30:23.170]  Yo, he's sleeping in his car with the garage closed with the CPAP on.
[30:24.150 --> 30:27.870]  No, no, no, that's next week. That's next week. I was like, how's your body doing that?
[30:28.550 --> 30:33.810]  I just feel like it's unlocked a whole new layer of sleeping for me. I can sleep in any position
[30:33.810 --> 30:39.570]  now. I can. It's great. I go on little adventures, get the pillows stacked, burrow in. I've done it
[30:39.570 --> 30:45.310]  too. I've done some like under under the pillow sleeping. But I do feel like if my face is too
[30:45.310 --> 30:51.070]  close to a pillow, the vent starts to create sound against the pillow. It starts. Yeah, that can be
[30:51.070 --> 30:56.670]  a problem. I just rewind it here for a second. What kind of little adventures are you going on?
[30:56.670 --> 31:01.190]  I'm just different layers of the different pillows. Sometimes we're going underneath
[31:02.030 --> 31:06.330]  like a throw like a little blanket type situation. I just feel like I'm adventuring.
[31:06.570 --> 31:12.110]  What? I just feel like I'm exploring a little bit. I just feel like I'm sleeping in new ways
[31:12.110 --> 31:16.430]  and it's exciting. So sometimes you like cramming your head between four and five and you're like,
[31:16.490 --> 31:23.550]  yeah, yeah. Or like different weights. I like feeling trapped in a safe place.
[31:27.970 --> 31:30.910]  I've got to say everything you said, I kind of know what he means.
[31:31.390 --> 31:35.530]  I kind of I kind of I kind of like being at like the bottom. I don't know if I can handle the
[31:35.530 --> 31:40.130]  bottom of Pillow Mountain. That seems like a lot to deal with. But like three or four pillows up,
[31:40.650 --> 31:45.650]  put my head in. I quite like weight on my eyes. Like I tried a weighted sleeping mask,
[31:45.870 --> 31:50.010]  but it was great. It was it wasn't very good. I didn't like it. You're basically deep sea diving
[31:50.010 --> 31:54.710]  in your bed. I am. That's how I feel like I'm adventuring. Yeah. You're like Jacques Cousteau.
[31:55.150 --> 31:59.870]  I feel like if I had I feel like I would genuinely be able to sleep if you put eight
[31:59.870 --> 32:05.450]  pillows stacked high on my face while I was papping like they're just pillows on my head
[32:05.450 --> 32:09.490]  and then someone sat on the top of the pillows. I think I could sleep like that.
[32:09.790 --> 32:12.990]  So you would like to be the pea in the princess and the pea situation?
[32:13.170 --> 32:17.910]  Yes. Yeah. I would be the bowling ball at the bottom of the mattresses.
[32:18.810 --> 32:24.810]  It's really it's comfy. I don't know. It's it's like I do. I feel like I've never scoobed
[32:24.810 --> 32:30.790]  before. I feel like I can scuba now. I feel like I've learned through this. I've scuba confidence
[32:30.790 --> 32:37.570]  because of the CPAP. I actually prefer CPAP sleep without then like no CPAP sleep. There's
[32:37.570 --> 32:41.970]  something fun about it. I know people don't enjoy having to be like hooked up to the machine.
[32:42.010 --> 32:45.470]  Typically, I actually I like. Well, it's not the point is that you're supposed to like it
[32:45.470 --> 32:48.550]  because you sleep well, finally. No, no. But like people that use it are like, oh,
[32:48.550 --> 32:52.790]  this sucks having to have like this machine attached to my face while I sleep. I actually
[32:52.790 --> 32:56.570]  kind of like I feel like I'm going on an adventure. Is that just because you have
[32:56.570 --> 33:07.490]  so few real life adventures? Oh, I just I just I don't know. I'm just happy about it.
[33:07.630 --> 33:14.370]  Why you got to yuck is yum. I'm with Gavin. Gavin, I'm with you, Andrew. I'm with you.
[33:15.050 --> 33:21.310]  I appreciate it all. It all comes down to Nick. Andrew, let's adventure in his bed.
[33:21.310 --> 33:26.410]  Wait, OK, so wait, hang on. So Nick, Nick wants to adventure with Andrew.
[33:26.750 --> 33:31.910]  I mean, I'll help him out, whatever. I don't know if Nick's been paying attention to what's
[33:33.290 --> 33:35.910]  apparently in the other room right now having a conversation with him.
[33:36.030 --> 33:38.990]  Nick could use a hose with air going directly into his mouth, I think.
[33:40.970 --> 33:43.470]  Nick needs a CPAP when he's awake. Yeah.
[33:45.370 --> 33:55.770]  Oh, Christ. Nick can throw... I love spending more time with Nick. You just
[33:57.270 --> 34:00.950]  chime in and I don't know which side he's on ever.
[34:01.570 --> 34:08.630]  What? I never expected going into face with you guys that Nick would be the wild card,
[34:08.630 --> 34:16.050]  but he kind of is. It's like that. It's like that all the time, too. 100%. He's the same way
[34:16.050 --> 34:20.230]  where he just he's agreeing with you, but the way he says it makes it seem like he's disagreeing
[34:20.230 --> 34:24.130]  with you. And then you're like, are we in a fight? Like, what is it? And he just keeps going,
[34:24.270 --> 34:34.190]  yeah, yeah, yeah. What? No. Yeah, it's crazy. I saw I think I talked about this with the guys
[34:34.190 --> 34:37.790]  the other day. I saw a post on Reddit that was like on the front page that was like,
[34:37.790 --> 34:42.530]  what legendary YouTube channel stopped making videos? And I wanted to see what Rooster Teeth
[34:42.530 --> 34:45.630]  ranked. So I went in and scrolled down and scrolled down and scrolled down. And then I
[34:45.630 --> 34:50.370]  finally saw someone said Achievement Hunter. So I replied and just said, LOL. But then I was reading
[34:50.370 --> 34:53.550]  some of the comments and people were like really going to bat for us. Like, check out Regulation
[34:53.550 --> 34:58.130]  Podcast. This is really awesome. They like, oh, they're still doing this stuff. It's so much fun.
[34:58.190 --> 35:01.990]  All these video game videos, whatever. And then it's like, oh, I like them all, but I hate Eric,
[35:02.110 --> 35:05.410]  blah, blah, blah. Oh, when Andrew does this, I don't like it. Blah, blah, blah. There was one
[35:05.410 --> 35:11.930]  guy that's like, yeah, I like the show, but I can't stand Nick. And I was like, oh, right.
[35:11.990 --> 35:16.550]  You don't need to worry about what people on the Internet are saying. That is the craziest take.
[35:16.750 --> 35:24.450]  That blew me away. I can't stand Nick. What the fuck are you talking about? Wild, wild, crazy.
[35:25.610 --> 35:32.370]  Nick said the craziest thing I think I've ever heard him say yesterday when we were recording
[35:32.370 --> 35:41.190]  a gameplay. Yeah. Gavin burped. And oh, my God. You remember what he said, Gavin? He said he said,
[35:41.630 --> 35:49.210]  oh, that sounded like a tasty one. Oh, you know, we weren't recording. We were just we were just
[35:49.210 --> 35:56.050]  getting ready to like set things up. And that was his genuine reaction to Gavin's burp. And it just
[35:56.050 --> 36:00.950]  like it. It was so crazy. It passed by without notice for a minute.
[36:02.670 --> 36:07.170]  You know, the kind of burp where you can taste what you had for lunch. But that's never good.
[36:07.730 --> 36:14.810]  That's so gross. It's gross. If you have a good lunch. Some foods is good. Yeah. There are some
[36:14.810 --> 36:18.970]  great times. That's right. Thank you. You're right, though, about Nick being the wild card
[36:18.970 --> 36:22.130]  because Michael brought this up where he's like, oh, you play video games with like Jeff. It's
[36:22.130 --> 36:25.030]  like, oh, Jeff, like throw a grenade. Then he's like, run, run, run. I'm like, yeah, that doesn't
[36:25.030 --> 36:30.550]  really happen with what we're doing. Mostly it's Nick listening to Gavin. And that's like
[36:30.550 --> 36:38.230]  ultimately our problem. And so when you hear about this burp. What? And you just go like,
[36:38.670 --> 36:42.330]  yeah, I mean, Gavin's like egging him on, but it's not like it takes even like a push.
[36:42.330 --> 36:46.630]  It's just like a kernel of an idea. Like he's incepting Nick while he's awake.
[36:48.550 --> 36:52.990]  But the inception is just going, hey, what about this?
[36:55.210 --> 37:00.250]  Somehow, somehow it's going seven layers deep and burrowing into an idea. It's like working.
[37:04.650 --> 37:10.230]  Do you guys, uh, you guys know, you guys ever see those articles online or like on Reddit or
[37:10.230 --> 37:14.390]  whatever or TikTok where they're like, what's something that you could do in 2000 that just
[37:14.390 --> 37:18.630]  doesn't exist or you can't do or the world doesn't work that way in 2025? You know what
[37:18.630 --> 37:21.690]  I'm talking about? You ever see those? No, but I know what you mean. I see them a lot and they're
[37:21.690 --> 37:25.770]  like, it's like, it's like, oh, you used to be able to walk up to the fucking gate at an airplane
[37:25.770 --> 37:30.310]  before 9-11. Sure. Like those kinds of things. I was at the grocery store with Emily the other day
[37:30.310 --> 37:35.850]  at H-E-B and we were leaving and I realized that we, we had the shopping cart, we were taking it
[37:35.850 --> 37:39.390]  out and it did that thing where it locked and we couldn't go any further. And the guy had to go,
[37:39.430 --> 37:44.190]  oh, I'm sorry. And he had to like press a device at our shopping cart to unrelease it. So we could
[37:44.190 --> 37:47.890]  go outside with it because I guess they have shopping cart theft they have to deal with.
[37:48.030 --> 37:54.930]  And that got me thinking, you couldn't launch Jackass in 2025. So much of the beginning of
[37:54.930 --> 37:59.770]  that series was shopping cart related. You just can't steal and use shopping carts in 2025
[37:59.770 --> 38:04.170]  anymore. They have the protective devices on them so they don't go outside of the parking lot.
[38:04.190 --> 38:08.490]  You'd have to jailbreak your carts first. You'd have to jailbreak your shopping cart so that you
[38:08.490 --> 38:15.110]  could run it into a shrub. If, if, if the Jackass guy started today, they would have a much harder
[38:15.110 --> 38:20.550]  time than they did way back in whenever it started. That was my realization. Wow. I couldn't
[38:20.550 --> 38:26.590]  think of a more lower stakes heist than finding a way to steal a row of shopping, like a bunch
[38:26.590 --> 38:30.950]  of shopping carts. Starts out low stakes, but they made hundreds of millions of dollars off that.
[38:33.450 --> 38:36.850]  Like, I don't mean individual theft of them. I'm imagining someone being like,
[38:36.850 --> 38:40.670]  okay, we're going to hit H-E-B where it hurts. We're stealing all of the carts.
[38:41.210 --> 38:47.590]  I think if you stole a line of like 40 shopping carts, that would be the loudest possible thing
[38:47.590 --> 38:54.910]  to steal. That would be pretty good. I mean, like when I worked at Target was like my first
[38:54.910 --> 39:00.350]  job and I pushed carts and they had like, it was just line them all up as many as you could
[39:00.350 --> 39:03.830]  and then push them to like the front of the store again, like from the parking lot.
[39:03.830 --> 39:10.150]  It was, well, just looking back on it, it was so loud. I never thought about it. It's so loud. Just
[39:10.150 --> 39:19.510]  being 16 years old, pushing 30 carts as hard as you can. Just like a sensory overload for eight
[39:19.510 --> 39:25.050]  hours a day. I'd never thought about that. Yeah. It's loud as shit. Speaking of carts and gaming
[39:25.050 --> 39:31.490]  thing, I need to talk about, I've been excited about this for a while. They announced a Garfield
[39:31.490 --> 39:40.910]  cart two and it is fucked in like the way that only Garfield cart could be. First of all, they
[39:40.910 --> 39:47.170]  didn't announce it via a trailer or announcement. There's just a steam page now for Garfield cart
[39:47.170 --> 39:53.150]  two and there's no other material on it. It just is like, hey, this is going to be a thing that
[39:53.150 --> 40:00.630]  happens. The other issue is that this is Garfield cart three. I don't know. I don't know what they're
[40:00.630 --> 40:06.110]  doing because there was Garfield cart and then there was Garfield cart furious racing. And now
[40:06.110 --> 40:12.550]  there's Garfield cart two. So I don't know if they're disregarding the first one or furious
[40:12.550 --> 40:21.370]  racing is like they've named their third one two for no reason. I'm very worried. I'm very worried
[40:21.370 --> 40:26.570]  about the quality of this game. It's a different dev team. The quality. Maybe it's a prequel to
[40:26.570 --> 40:33.910]  furious racing. It could be, but it's a different dev team and their last game was Smurfs racing,
[40:34.110 --> 40:39.410]  which did not have online multiplayer. So I'm worried. I'm worried that there won't be any
[40:39.410 --> 40:44.230]  online multiplayer in this thing. It does have a leaderboard, apparently Smurfs racing, but.
[40:45.490 --> 40:50.470]  There could be more Garfield cart in our life. Garfield cart two slash three has much been shown
[40:50.470 --> 40:55.490]  from Garfield cart two slash three. No, not that I've seen like it's just a steam page. I don't
[40:55.490 --> 41:00.050]  think there's a trailer out for it. At least last time I looked, I just I got really excited
[41:00.050 --> 41:04.370]  because all these people were tagging me that Garfield cart two is coming. And then I looked
[41:04.370 --> 41:09.310]  at it and it's like it's just a steam page. Like it's not even an announcement. Like they just
[41:09.310 --> 41:14.470]  made a store page for a thing. I don't think they've even officially commented on it. What
[41:14.470 --> 41:19.250]  if it's just some guy made a page for it? No, it looks like a real game and it has like the
[41:20.110 --> 41:24.350]  everything's credentialed the right way, but it just is not. It's not looking good for Garfield
[41:24.350 --> 41:30.170]  cart. As someone who's a believer, you know, people people swear by Sonic racing, obviously
[41:30.170 --> 41:34.810]  Mario Kart leader in the space, but Garfield cart two furious rate. They really figured out some
[41:34.810 --> 41:41.910]  things and that racer and. I'm going to wait. Oh, yeah. Eric just posted the box art. It looks like
[41:41.910 --> 41:50.410]  shit. Oh, you can drift. The proportions on Garfield are not right now. His head to body
[41:50.410 --> 41:54.990]  a little mean teeth. Yeah, he has mean teeth. Normals wearing a little hat.
[41:56.330 --> 42:01.510]  Here's for reference. Here's. Oh, that's a quality. That's a good looking Garfield right
[42:01.510 --> 42:05.830]  there. Yeah, that's a great Garfield furious racing. Great game. Yeah. Do you think it'll
[42:05.830 --> 42:11.090]  come out on switch to? I think everything's coming out on switch to that kid. Oh, cool.
[42:11.470 --> 42:15.710]  I can't believe cyberpunks on switch to how does that run? I'm wild. Not just that it's
[42:15.710 --> 42:20.030]  on switch. It's all on the cartridge, which is insane. Yeah, it's really impressive.

[43:16.580 --> 43:22.820]  I had another racing video game related thing. I'm going to share my screen. I got an achievement
[43:22.820 --> 43:30.740]  in a unique way in Roadcraft. We filmed a few videos in Roadcraft. It's so good. It's great.
[43:31.100 --> 43:36.500]  It's a great game. It's the best game I've ever played. Gavin got that achievement that I got
[43:36.500 --> 43:40.880]  that I'm going to show in a video that we filmed. I don't even know how I got it, but I checked
[43:40.880 --> 43:49.720]  Is it the falling one? It's the falling one. So this is a clip of me and I talked to Nick,
[43:49.800 --> 43:55.380]  so I think we're recording this. Are you on sunken here? I am on sunken here. I'm trying
[43:55.380 --> 44:01.980]  to clean up a road, so I filled up literally as many blocks as I can, pieces of cement,
[44:01.980 --> 44:05.600]  and I had just spent a lot of time looking at my map. I'm going to hit this clip. So we're
[44:05.600 --> 44:10.380]  starting. I'm like, OK, I'm ready to go. Let's go. Oh, no, I filled it up and I'm tipping.
[44:10.380 --> 44:18.440]  That sucks. And then this happens. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that happened to my friend,
[44:18.520 --> 44:23.160]  I think, one time. Yeah, that I've seen that a few hundred times in SnowRunner. Oh, yeah.
[44:23.760 --> 44:29.760]  That's a SnowRunner thing. This is a carryover. Oh, I've never experienced this before. Oh, yeah.
[44:30.360 --> 44:36.660]  You're like a tornado. I am destroying all of the trees in the area. I'm flipping around. I'm flying
[44:36.660 --> 44:42.100]  for people that are just listening. My truck is spinning like a tornado rapidly in all directions.
[44:42.220 --> 44:48.760]  But unlike SnowRunner, there's no vehicle health, so I'm not taking damage. You are what happened
[44:48.760 --> 44:57.000]  to that town. I'll show you where I end up. You're the natural disaster. That's where I end up.
[44:57.180 --> 45:03.680]  Oh my God. Upside down on the roof. Upside down on a roof nearby. Wow. I'm just bouncing around.
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.320]  I'm stuck. I'm wiggling. He's trying to get out. I'm trying to use my crane to get me off of this
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.280]  building. Yeah, the problem you have here, too, as I say, you could just recover, but you're going
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.480]  to leave all that concrete on that roof. But that's OK, because I just didn't want it on the
[45:17.480 --> 45:23.840]  road. I think that's eventually the conclusion I come to is I realize, oh, I can strap. But my
[45:23.840 --> 45:30.200]  engine is stalled, so I can't activate things the way I want. But I think I get off of it. Yeah,
[45:30.200 --> 45:36.620]  I release it. And then there we go. And then I just start spinning. It starts breaking.
[45:37.780 --> 45:43.800]  It's like your boom does not move that fast. That's crazy. It's like it got spun around and
[45:43.800 --> 45:47.780]  it has to spin back all the times it's spun around. It's like I was possessed. But that
[45:47.780 --> 45:51.800]  has been some of my road craft adventures recently. It broke and I got the achievement
[45:52.360 --> 45:59.000]  in the process of me just flying around the map as a tornado truck. It was a great time.
[45:59.000 --> 46:05.220]  That's great. We have filmed two videos in that game, one with three of us and one with four of
[46:05.220 --> 46:11.060]  us. And just so we're clear, I personally would like to film one thousand more videos in this
[46:11.060 --> 46:16.540]  game. Yeah, it's if and whenever you guys want to. I'm 3 a.m. I'm up for filming videos in this game.
[46:16.680 --> 46:21.520]  I never want to stop playing this game. It's amazing. It's so much fun. There have been so
[46:21.520 --> 46:29.280]  many great games. And then Mind's Eye also came out. What's Mind's Eye? Mind's Eye was a game.
[46:30.220 --> 46:38.500]  Yeah, it's one of the studio heads of Rockstar left and made their own studio called Build a
[46:38.500 --> 46:44.840]  Rocket Boy. And Mind's Eye is the first game under that umbrella. And it looks like it's supposed to
[46:44.840 --> 46:50.520]  be an open world action game, but it's a linear action game in an open world that has nothing
[46:50.520 --> 46:57.180]  in it. And it is incredibly broken in so many ways. It's so stupid. What's that game you guys
[46:57.180 --> 47:02.860]  did a video in yesterday? I saw on the Discord. Oh, we played The Altars, which is a really cool
[47:03.320 --> 47:07.640]  game in which you are like get stranded on a planet and you're trying to escape it essentially
[47:07.640 --> 47:12.320]  by recovering resources on the planet. It looked so interesting. Single player, though?
[47:12.780 --> 47:18.220]  It is single player only. Yeah. That would be so cool, though, if it had multiplayer and you were
[47:18.220 --> 47:25.460]  waiting to be born. That would be cool because you have to make a thing called the womb and you
[47:25.460 --> 47:31.460]  create iterations of you. So, yeah, you're just waiting. Player two plays the sheep.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.920]  Mind's Eye is, I think, the worst game I've played this year. And it's like very popular
[47:37.920 --> 47:43.140]  worst. It's gotten a lot of attention due to how bad it is. Do you think it'll get good over time?
[47:43.700 --> 47:47.940]  No, that's the problem. They're like fixing it. They're like fixing a lot of the bugs,
[47:47.940 --> 47:53.760]  but it just as a core game is not great to play. It's not a ton of fun. What platform is it on?
[47:54.180 --> 48:00.380]  It's on everything. It's a 500 million dollar budgeted game. That is. Is there a multiplayer?
[48:00.800 --> 48:05.000]  They're going to add it apparently, but I don't. It's one of those things where I'd be surprised
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.660]  if they continue to support it. And anyway, if they add it, we got to do it. Oh, we definitely
[48:10.660 --> 48:14.040]  have to do it. I 100 percent. I got all the achievements. I needed to see everything that
[48:14.040 --> 48:21.600]  was in that thing. Wait. You 100 percent in a game that you didn't. What is the worst game you
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.040]  played this year and you 100 percent of it? I needed to see everything that was in that thing
[48:26.040 --> 48:34.140]  because it is fucking it's just insane. It's like it is a completely empty open world. There's
[48:34.140 --> 48:41.680]  nothing you can do. I played a mission where you have to drive five miles. There's no map.
[48:41.680 --> 48:46.800]  You have a mini map and that's it. You can't open the map. There's no broader like you can't
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.600]  see the world map in any way. They just don't want you to see how small the map is. No, it's huge.
[48:51.740 --> 48:56.700]  That's the problem. It's a fucking huge map. And if you go in a direction they don't want,
[48:56.760 --> 49:02.460]  they'll fail the mission on you. So I'm driving a car. And the only time you get a waypoint
[49:02.460 --> 49:07.880]  marker is when you're in your vehicle. So I'm in a vehicle and I'm driving and it gets destroyed
[49:07.880 --> 49:14.620]  and you can't steal random vehicles on the street. And it's also a scenario in the game in which all
[49:14.620 --> 49:20.800]  the cars are gone. So I had to run five miles on foot without being able to see the map and there
[49:20.800 --> 49:26.240]  being no enemies of any kind. And it was a thing where I'd be running and then the guy would say,
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.280]  Whoa, where are you going, buddy? That's the wrong way. And I'm just running towards the marker.
[49:30.400 --> 49:37.500]  So then I'd have to turn around and run like four blocks. I spent 30 minutes real time having to
[49:37.500 --> 49:44.660]  run to this location to do the mission. It is horrendously bad. It is like impressively...
[49:44.660 --> 49:51.160]  I flipped my car. It was on fire and I tried to leave and it wouldn't let me. And I thought,
[49:51.220 --> 49:55.780]  Oh, it's just broken. And then I realized there's a button to flip your car because the car weight
[49:55.780 --> 49:59.800]  physics are really weird. So like you're constantly flipping your vehicle over and then you're
[49:59.800 --> 50:05.640]  pushing X to get it back up. There was no way to exit your vehicle upside down. So my car is in
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.660]  complete flames and I had to reorient it to be back on its wheels before it would let me leave
[50:11.660 --> 50:20.420]  the vehicle before it exploded. It is so bad. There's a boss fight where it's like the boss
[50:20.420 --> 50:24.360]  gets called and is like, kill this person. And instead of killing them, for some reason,
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.300]  they take them to the roof and then you chase them and then you go to fight them. And they're
[50:29.300 --> 50:32.560]  like, no, actually, I'm going to step away and you're going to fight drones instead.
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.440]  And so you're fighting drones for no reason, but you can ping. And I noticed when I pinged,
[50:38.440 --> 50:45.300]  I got a marker for where they hid the like the NPC of the boss. They just put them in a wall
[50:45.780 --> 50:50.220]  and I was looking and I like there is no door to where they could have been, but I'm still getting
[50:50.220 --> 50:56.540]  a marker for him. It is a disaster. He was. I could go on and on, but it's it's so impressively
[50:56.540 --> 51:03.280]  bad and it's weird in a way that I couldn't resist. I had to keep playing. You unlock free
[51:03.280 --> 51:11.700]  mode by beating the game, but there's nothing to do in the world. That's nuts. That is part of it
[51:11.700 --> 51:18.080]  is like it's sort of build tools. So the idea being that like you can build all of these experiences
[51:18.080 --> 51:27.140]  yourself if you're on PC and you have the PC version of it. But it's just it's it's incoherent.
[51:27.560 --> 51:35.040]  They outsource the the game creation to you. That's sort of the idea. It has had such a bad
[51:35.040 --> 51:43.580]  launch. I think the like steam highest concurrence is under 2000. So I just I don't I think they're
[51:43.580 --> 51:46.720]  going to drop everything for it. And what's unfortunate is this summer they're supposed
[51:46.720 --> 51:52.680]  to add Agent 47 for a Hitman mission. And I just don't think that'll happen now.
[51:53.180 --> 52:00.320]  But he'll only be inside a wall. It will only be in a wall. It's just weird things for me of like
[52:00.880 --> 52:05.520]  Lizzie McGuire, the show Lizzie McGuire, the little brother from that show, plays an Elon
[52:05.520 --> 52:10.860]  Musk character in this, and it just looks like him. And so it's like I'm playing and then I'm
[52:10.860 --> 52:15.240]  going, well, that looks like Lizzie McGuire's little brother. And then it actually is like
[52:15.240 --> 52:20.400]  it's just so it's so bizarre. Is he playing Lizzie McGuire's brother in the game?
[52:20.880 --> 52:27.920]  He is playing Elon Musk essentially is the thing that he's going for in that game.
[52:28.680 --> 52:32.120]  I can't believe you 100% of this thing. You're crazy.
[52:32.720 --> 52:35.900]  Just a heads up for the portion of our audience that does not like video games
[52:35.900 --> 52:39.440]  and doesn't watch our gameplay. We are filming three drafts tomorrow.
[52:42.840 --> 52:45.020]  Yes. It's true. It's true.
[52:45.460 --> 52:50.680]  Lots of drafts on the lots of non video game related content on the books coming up.
[52:51.140 --> 52:56.040]  Just FYI. I want to make sure the audience knows we're servicing both both sides there.
[52:56.600 --> 53:00.480]  Yes. I'm excited for the drafts tomorrow. I got to do research.
[53:01.180 --> 53:05.480]  Yeah, I haven't been able to do any real work on them yet. That's going to be my tonight.
[53:05.580 --> 53:06.240]  Yeah, I'll do that tonight.
[53:06.240 --> 53:09.760]  I've started doing bringing video game glitches into real life.
[53:10.580 --> 53:13.180]  It kind of happened unintentionally, but I dropped something the other day,
[53:13.280 --> 53:18.860]  and my first instinct was just to T-pose in place. Like my life had gone wrong a little bit,
[53:19.180 --> 53:22.360]  and I'm just going to incorporate that more every time I drop something.
[53:23.060 --> 53:25.240]  You're going to convince somebody that they're in the matrix?
[53:27.800 --> 53:31.920]  I do so much stuff that no one sees just because it makes me giggle.
[53:33.160 --> 53:38.260]  Is T-posing the next, like what, outside of T-posing, what is something you do?
[53:38.800 --> 53:44.520]  I once, this kind of really disturbed Meg, she didn't like it at all, but I once was just
[53:44.960 --> 53:51.600]  awake in the house on my own. Meg was still asleep. And I thought, I wonder if I can...
[53:52.380 --> 53:57.480]  I was like, I wonder what it would look like if my legs kidnapped me. And I just...
[53:57.480 --> 53:57.700]  What?
[53:58.160 --> 53:59.160]  I let...
[53:59.660 --> 54:00.900]  What the fuck?
[54:02.020 --> 54:03.360]  Are you alright?
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.620]  So I laid down on the floor as if I was asleep or like unconscious. And then I just started
[54:08.620 --> 54:17.120]  walking around, but just from the knees down. So my, so my legs were dragging the rest of my body
[54:17.120 --> 54:23.040]  around the house while I was like completely lying down with my arms, like up above my head.
[54:24.060 --> 54:27.900]  And I showed her, I showed her a video of it and she was like, Oh, that's creepy.
[54:31.180 --> 54:35.160]  Are we talking like an Addams family thing with like the hand, but it's your,
[54:35.240 --> 54:37.040]  your legs like becoming sentient?
[54:37.520 --> 54:40.980]  Yeah. So imagine, imagine you're just lying down completely flat on your back.
[54:41.340 --> 54:41.640]  Okay.
[54:41.640 --> 54:44.680]  And your arms are extended like out behind your head. So they're
[54:46.060 --> 54:46.380]  Okay.
[54:46.500 --> 54:49.400]  Wrists down behind you. And then just start walking.
[54:52.800 --> 54:54.840]  I like T-posing a lot more than this.
[54:54.880 --> 54:55.140]  Okay.
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.440]  I'm a big fan of the T-posing.
[54:58.440 --> 55:02.700]  I did it like a whole lap of the kitchen, just being dragged by my hands.
[55:05.960 --> 55:08.820]  What, you guys don't do that? You guys don't kidnap yourself?
[55:09.320 --> 55:11.020]  I don't think I've ever kidnapped myself.
[55:11.300 --> 55:12.480]  I don't think so.
[55:14.140 --> 55:15.660]  Oh man, teach their own.
[55:17.280 --> 55:22.180]  I had a, maybe you'll remember this, Jeff. I brought this up to him and he didn't seem
[55:22.180 --> 55:25.740]  to remember it. You probably won't. Maybe somebody will.
[55:26.060 --> 55:26.300]  I will.
[55:26.300 --> 55:27.420]  Did I ever talk about that?
[55:29.020 --> 55:34.100]  That I, this was a very long time ago that I thought that there was like an animal or
[55:34.100 --> 55:38.500]  something like I could hear stomping in like my rooftop. Like I thought that maybe there
[55:38.500 --> 55:42.100]  was like a, I know birds moved in there at one point, but I thought that maybe like a
[55:42.100 --> 55:42.960]  raccoon or something.
[55:43.260 --> 55:46.000]  I thought that's how you tricked me into listening to your farts.
[55:46.920 --> 55:47.460]  Was it?
[55:47.720 --> 55:48.120]  I thought that.
[55:48.360 --> 55:53.600]  Yeah, there was like, that was how we got like, we got like birdchirp.mp3 or whatever
[55:53.600 --> 55:54.920]  or birdchirp.wave.
[55:54.920 --> 56:02.040]  It was just, it was like clearly like a movement sound that would happen on the roof.
[56:02.580 --> 56:08.560]  And it was very odd. I'd never experienced anything like it. And then it stopped at around
[56:08.560 --> 56:14.820]  the same time the people that lived in the apartment next door moved out. So I thought,
[56:14.880 --> 56:20.200]  oh, maybe it was like sound because sometimes sound travels in like a weird way here.
[56:20.560 --> 56:24.260]  And they had kids that would run around. So I thought maybe it would just, it was that.
[56:24.920 --> 56:31.500]  And then recently I talked to somebody else that lives in this building and I learned
[56:31.500 --> 56:38.080]  that it wasn't, it wasn't that. It was a person that lives above me. And I guess they were
[56:38.080 --> 56:44.860]  known in the building when they would have like episodes, they would hop out of their unit and
[56:44.860 --> 56:50.660]  land on top of mine essentially, and just do sprints. And that's how they would handle it.
[56:50.660 --> 56:57.420]  It would just sprint across the rooftop. So I had a person, I thought it was like an animal thing
[56:57.420 --> 57:02.180]  because it sounded like running, but there was just a person that was doing sprints on my roof.
[57:02.500 --> 57:07.800]  What the fuck kind of episode is that? Do you, do you think that's what Gavin has?
[57:09.120 --> 57:17.000]  Oh, maybe they moved to Austin. Damn it. Shit. Is it possible that your neighbor was a snake?
[57:17.660 --> 57:25.740]  I, oh, I got to check their tongue. But I thought about when it was happening, like getting a cheap
[57:25.740 --> 57:31.640]  Amazon drone and flying it up to see like if I could see anything, I would have died. I would
[57:31.640 --> 57:37.680]  have had a heart attack if I saw just a person doing sprints at 2am on my roof. Also a person
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.780]  that's in the mental state that requires them to have an episode where they run across a rooftop
[57:43.780 --> 57:49.020]  at two in the morning. You fly a drone up to that person, you are sending them into a deeper and
[57:49.020 --> 57:53.600]  darker down a spiral that they are on. You know what I mean? Suddenly the government really is
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.340]  watching them. And yeah, you, it's probably safer that you didn't do that. Sounds like a mission
[57:57.340 --> 58:04.580]  in mind's eye. Other drone missions in mind's eye. I've, uh, I found it. I found a video.
[58:05.700 --> 58:09.060]  Oh, you found the feat video? I'm putting it in Slack.
[58:09.960 --> 58:17.300]  All right. Okay, I'll describe what I'm watching. So Gavin is on the floor and his thing. He's in
[58:17.300 --> 58:26.280]  the position he's talked about. His like, he's just, yeah, it's so... I see. I totally get why
[58:26.280 --> 58:32.920]  she didn't like that. Oh no, the cats are investigating. They're very into it. Oh no, she's gonna get you!
[58:34.440 --> 58:42.880]  So if you've ever played Hitman from the waist up, he looks like when you're pulling a body
[58:42.880 --> 58:48.940]  in Hitman to like dump them in a garbage can or whatever, but it's just him propelling himself
[58:48.940 --> 58:54.420]  forward with his legs, taking little steps. Can that go in the video? Is that safe? Yeah,
[58:54.480 --> 58:58.780]  let me, uh, do like a better crop on it. Okay. Okay. And, uh, I'll get you a better version.
[58:58.780 --> 59:04.820]  I think at the time I was thinking of me, myself, and Irene, like what if one of me was unconscious,
[59:05.080 --> 59:11.580]  but the other one wasn't? And, uh, that's what I came up with. Crazy. Goddamn. Have you tried
[59:11.580 --> 59:18.280]  doing that from the... could you do it reversed? What does that mean? Push instead of pull? Yeah,
[59:18.520 --> 59:23.740]  like push or pull, or maybe do like your arms are trying to kidnap everything else.
[59:26.140 --> 59:28.720]  Well, I could get myself in a headlock and drag it myself around.
[59:29.220 --> 59:32.320]  I, yeah, I don't know if the headlock is necessary, but just the idea of like
[59:32.320 --> 59:36.940]  not definitely legs, but arms going forward. I don't know. Well, I mean,
[59:36.980 --> 59:41.400]  this is my version. Maybe you should come up with your version. I'm good.
[59:46.380 --> 59:51.040]  I'm good. I'll, I'll copy you in the T posing. I like that. Okay. That's fine.
[59:51.040 --> 59:57.960]  I had an idea, Eric, that isn't a funny idea, but I think it might be a fun idea. I don't know
[59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.760]  where it would fit in the, in our universe, but I wanted to run it by you specifically.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.720]  Sounds like a bench in San Francisco. Sorry.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.120]  I do want to have a bench in every state. I think that's a great idea.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:18.340]  I was thinking the other day about how, um, I was reading an article of, of like, if you were to,
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:24.960]  if you were to, uh, draft the all time, best Yankees team from Yankees players throughout
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.120]  history. So if you just made like a, you constructed the best Yankees team possible
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.580]  from the, uh, from every person who's ever played for the Yankees. Right. And I was thinking,
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.660]  what if you did that for every team? Like, that would be fun to see who the bet, like the all
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:42.560]  time, but you got like shoeless, Joe Jackson playing on the White Sox team next to Robin
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.160]  and, and, you know, and the big hurt. And, uh, you've got Tatis next to Tony Gwynn or whatever
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:54.920]  on the Padres. And, uh, you create all 30 teams. You can do this for other sports too, football,
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.500]  basketball, whatever, but you, you, you build out these teams that are the best possible team
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:06.140]  you could field from the history of that team. And then you put them in a league and Simit and
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:11.320]  see who the best baseball team of all time is. Yeah. That's a great idea. It's not funny.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.900]  I don't know that it would make like content. I mean, it's gotta, it'd have to make some kind
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:19.460]  of content, but I just think it would be an interesting thing to do. I think it's a great
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:27.380]  idea. I think it's definitely like a deceptive thing too, where it's like who everyone's going
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:33.460]  to have their like, Oh yeah, this guy, not that guy. Cause it's like their specific team. Uh,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.420]  but like, I like that idea. I like that. I like, I bet Nick has a lot of opinions about,
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:46.700]  you know, the Phillies, uh, where I won't, but like, could you imagine a Spurs team that has
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:53.900]  Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Victor Wimbenyama, David Robinson, Tony Parker, all on it at the
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:00.960]  same time? Like, Oh, well, I wouldn't like it. You know, I don't like the Spurs, but
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.400]  they have such a, it's fucking crazy to think about. Yeah. Yeah. I, I, I like that idea. I
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.900]  like that idea into something. Cause I, I think there's something there. I like that creating,
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:18.960]  creating like the goat roster for, uh, every team and then somehow simming them against each other.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:25.380]  I just don't know. I don't know what we do with it. I used to do season Sims back in the old age
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:31.180]  days. Uh, I, there was a period where I fucked my hand up and I had to get surgery on it to get my
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:34.580]  tendons repaired. And then I had to go through like six months of physical therapy. And so I was
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:39.840]  in a cast for like three or four months in a row there. And the only, I only had one hand I could
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.820]  use for gaming, uh, because it was my, my, my left hand and my thumb that I had fucked up. And
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:51.540]  so I was useless. And so I just made a show called age presents where I just simmed sports constantly
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.540]  and it did okay. But I always had so much fun doing it. And I would do that. I'd, I'd sim like,
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:03:02.360]  who's better, the 72 Milwaukee bucks or the 86 Celtics to see, you know, we should, we should
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.480]  do that. Like maybe we'll do that at the office. Maybe we'll put something together and see what
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.580]  we can do. Cause I, I really liked that idea. I think it'd be, I think it'd just be a fun and
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:14.140]  interesting idea. Yeah. I would do the pettiest sports fan thing of all time where in NHL,
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:20.960]  I would go into be a GM mode and I'd pick teams I hated and I just dismantled them. I would just
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.420]  give away all of their best assets for dog shit players. I'd trade away their picks. And then
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:33.800]  I would just sim us failing miserably. And that is where I'd get my joy from is just tanking this
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:40.360]  franchise as an incompetent GM dude that got this job. It would bring me so much joy. You are a true
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:47.360]  sports fan. Absolutely. Yeah. I spent more time doing that than doing the reverse of like taking
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.620]  over my favorite franchise and bringing them to make it like, that's fun. I've done that a lot,
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:58.900]  but oh, there's a special type of joy of getting rid of a team's entire assets and also a
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:05.680]  believability of like, this is what incompetence GMs do. I'm trading away Luka Doncic without any
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.360]  warning, without any team knowing. Like I'm just, this is, this is all believable what I'm doing,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:17.280]  but oh, I've only experienced it as the fan who has it happen to them. It is so much fun to be
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.660]  the person that is making these decisions. You're like, I'm Nico Harrison. I'm Matt Ishbia. I'm
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.340]  going to destroy this team. Oh, whoopsie. Looks like I traded away everything and we suck. Oh
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:35.440]  no. I'm still making all my money. We're going to bet the farm on a, on a one-legged 35 year
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.360]  old Kevin Durant. Oops. We're going to get rid of Kevin Durant for next to nothing.
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:46.280]  Uh, by the time this is out, it'll be pretty dated, but uh, I think, is it Danny Ainge who
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:54.780]  runs the jazz? Yeah. Yeah. He's the, he's the, the jazz GM now, I believe. Taking the,
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.680]  they had with the drafters last night at the time of this, uh, recording, taking Ace Bailey when,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:06.400]  uh, when Ace Bailey made it really clear, I don't want to go to Utah. I don't want to play for the
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.440]  jazz. Do not have me go here. I don't want to do this. I won't work out with you. I don't want
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.900]  anything to do with you. And then the jazz going, that's great. Welcome to the Utah jazz
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:22.260]  is so fucking funny. It's that's incredible. That's incredible. The Reddit comments last
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:25.980]  night I was watching, cause I was in the car driving home during the draft. So I was just
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:30.060]  keeping up with it on Reddit on like the mega thread and the comments were so fucking funny.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.340]  They were like, Ace Bailey, go fuck yourself. Also, welcome to the team. You're not a big sports
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.660]  guy. Hope you like, hope you like dirty soda asshole. Do you have a fandom that is based in
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:46.760]  suffering? And the way that sports is like, is there anything that you enjoy that ultimately
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:53.240]  is just brings you misery? Maybe Bond movies? Really? You think they're more bad Bond movies?
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.740]  Like I said, I was trying to equate, like, what would be his equivalent of sports fandom?
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.500]  Cause Gavin doesn't really care about sports. Yeah. I don't really know what anyone said for
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:06.060]  the last five minutes, but I remember always getting excited for the new Bond. And it seems
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:10.100]  like the first Bond movie video actor is always great. And then it's just a steaming pile of
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.840]  sliding downhill until they change. You know, that's kind of how I feel about mission impossible
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.960]  movies. I'm always really excited for them. And then I watch it and I go, yeah, I wasn't three.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.900]  Are you excited about Denny Villeneuve directing the next one or no?
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.380]  I didn't even know. Oh, really? Oh, this is how you found out? Oh my goodness. Yeah.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.960]  They just announced it yesterday. I'm not interested in stuff until I could watch or use it.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:41.780]  Got it. I've never enjoyed E3. I don't like hearing about stuff that's coming out. I just
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.320]  let me know when it's ready. You don't like anticipating things? No, I don't really watch
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.860]  trailers if I could help it. Well, I get that. But like the concept of being anti-anticipation
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:56.900]  is really fun. It's just too much. Like I remember getting excited when they did that
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:04.400]  Elder Scrolls 6 announcement. And more time has passed since that announcement than the time gap
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.500]  between Skyrim and that announcement. Holy hell. Yeah, I like I get what you're saying,
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.160]  but I just I find it the idea of like, I don't like looking forward to things
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:20.920]  is the statement that you're making. No, but I'm I'm I'm kind of with you. I'm I'm with you.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.200]  Well, there's like there's a nice window of it. Like like, for example, right now,
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.640]  could not be more excited about a Donkey Kong game. I'm I've I'm so excited. But it's only
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.880]  like a month away. I don't want to hear about anything that's more than a month away.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.660]  Really? I'm I'm I'm kind of with you on that, though, because I I am I could not be more
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:44.400]  excited for the Donkey Kong game. Absolutely. But also, I don't want to keep thinking about it
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.440]  because I can't play it right now and I'm frustrated that I can't play it right now.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:53.420]  See, I have the reverse like I get what you're saying, but for me, it's like the people that
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:59.900]  made Hitman are making that new James Bond game. And I just read a story about how there is there
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:06.780]  are rumors that that James Bond game will have like elusive target type mission type things
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:12.380]  where it's like timed missions that I never considered that I never considered any live
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:17.420]  service aspect of that game, sort of like Hitman has. And I'm so excited for that possibility.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.300]  Yeah, I just feel like being excited now doesn't do anything for me there.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.020]  You get the excitement now? Well, it doesn't change anything, does it?
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.060]  It brings joy to my life is what I get from it.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.840]  I'm happy about it. Gavin rejects your joy. He does. To be honest, I did like go to E3 a bunch
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:42.640]  a decade ago and I was I was never excited to be there. And I love games. Yeah, I don't.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.900]  It's definitely I mean, they used to have games on the floor, though, right? Like there
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:53.640]  were some playable things, I feel like. Yeah, until until 30 minutes into the show and they broke
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.460]  and then there'd be a sign on and they'd say, could you come back a little bit later? We're
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:03.480]  working on fixing the build. Interesting. E3 sucked. I'm with you. I think it's a better
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:11.220]  format this way. Like what we get now, I think is a better thing for E3. It was great for a time
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:15.580]  and it's just the time sort of passed. And I think that's just fine. I don't know. I just like the
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:19.940]  only thing I ever took away from them was all the things people would complain about. And I just end
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:24.140]  up just leaving an event where everyone was bitching about something. I feel like E3 died
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:29.920]  for me when Gary Coleman did. He was such a big part of E3 every year. I'd always see him there
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:35.480]  doing stuff and he wasn't anymore. Interesting tie in. I like going back and rewatching E3
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.560]  press conferences because, you know, the story of everything. Like how it all worked out. Yeah.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:46.520]  So like games that like you forget had a huge presentation and backing for their reveal and
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:52.220]  then being like, oh, nobody ultimately played that or cared about that. Like Evolve. Yes.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:10:00.120]  There is a string I recently rewatched, I think was E3 2015 for Xbox, and it was like Evolve,
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.700]  Scalebound and a fable multiplayer only game. It was like three games in a row that never came out
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:10.400]  and they were just back to back to back. And it was so funny watching it now. You're like,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.060]  oh, none of these happen. None of this stuff works out. And I think just the more I learned
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:20.940]  about that industry is. I just feel like people would work on a game, it'd be like Crunch Central
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:25.480]  and then they'd be cramming to get something out for E3 that would end up not being in the game
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.020]  or like not or they couldn't physically couldn't ship that in the game. It's just like, why are
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:35.380]  we bothering to do this? This is like pointless man-made hurdle in game development. Totally.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.720]  Good promo though. It is. And it's like a thing where I think the way they do it now is so much
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.740]  healthier for everybody involved in the industry. But I do I do miss the absurdity of every company
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:54.180]  having to put on this giant event within like two hours of each other back to back to back to back.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:01.480]  Trying to outdo each other. Yes. Fighting to rent spaces and theaters around San Diego to
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:07.380]  or L.A. to fucking have their dumb events at. It's like, hey, check it out. Cirque du Soleil is here.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.460]  Now play this video game. Just nice having a bunch of people get together to try to identify
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.820]  like an exotic bird or something like that.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:25.120]  The fuck is this thing? Well, and now that we're back around to the exotic birds, this is
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.640]  if this was Christopher Reeve's horse, it'd be it'd be time for Gavin to go around back and
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:36.560]  put two between its eyes. Put this baby to bed. Thank you for listening to another episode of
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.920]  the regulation podcast. Be on the lookout for some drafts in the near future and some gameplay videos.
[01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:49.020]  Maybe maybe we'll all get kidnapped by our legs and film it. You never know here on regulation.
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:51.700]  We'll see you next time. Bye.
