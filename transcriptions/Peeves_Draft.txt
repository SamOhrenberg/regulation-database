[00:30.000 --> 00:31.140]  Who wants to lead this one?
[00:31.500 --> 00:33.780]  I don't remember. I feel like this was a Geoff one, but I don't remember.
[00:34.020 --> 00:36.140]  I think, uh, I can lead it. Hold on.
[00:36.200 --> 00:36.340]  Okay.
[00:36.880 --> 00:41.380]  Hello, and welcome to another regulation draft. This one's a Gavin idea.
[00:41.560 --> 00:43.180]  Gavin, why don't you go ahead and tell us about it?
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.920]  Oh, classic. This is pretty good.
[00:46.920 --> 00:49.460]  I mean, this was my idea. Do you want it to be your idea?
[00:49.520 --> 00:49.800]  It was?
[00:49.900 --> 00:51.280]  Well, then why didn't you say anything?
[00:51.600 --> 00:55.220]  No, I just fucking introduced you to Gavin! Oh my god!
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.500]  Well, just right before, Eric said this was a Geoff idea, so I was like, oh, okay.
[00:58.500 --> 01:02.280]  I said, I think this is a Geoff idea, and then you didn't say shit.
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.320]  And I said, I got it, I'll intro, and then I introed her to the correct person.
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.680]  You! Are you feeling okay today?
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.320]  So some people in here are peeved. This is the peeves draft.
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.780]  I think I just developed a new pet peeve.
[01:17.840 --> 01:19.480]  Yeah, I wrote a new one down.
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.760]  I mean, we've done this before. This is literally, I feel like this happened last week.
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.180]  This exact same thing.
[01:25.360 --> 01:27.620]  Yeah, I just don't know why Gavin didn't say, oh, this was mine.
[01:27.620 --> 01:29.360]  You guys know that drafts are five players?
[01:29.560 --> 01:30.460]  Didn't last week either.
[01:32.820 --> 01:33.780]  Since when, Nick?
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.300]  This is the peeves draft. We do it on the regulation draft generator,
[01:40.340 --> 01:43.940]  brought to you, I believe, by Sean Bear on Auction House.
[01:44.540 --> 01:47.120]  This is a randomized draft, just like always.
[01:47.240 --> 01:50.520]  So how many times are we going to randomize the names to figure out
[01:50.520 --> 01:53.760]  who is going first and who is going last in this snake draft?
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.040]  Well, it's 2025, so maybe we should do it 2025 times.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.540]  Okay, or does anyone have a second idea?
[02:02.460 --> 02:03.140]  Uh, 25.
[02:03.760 --> 02:06.500]  Okay, I like that idea about 2000 times more.
[02:06.740 --> 02:09.260]  So, uh, 25 works for me. You guys ready?
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.160]  I'm ready.
[02:10.380 --> 02:10.920]  Snake draft!
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.920]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[02:13.740 --> 02:15.200]  Gavin, Nick, Eric, Jeff, Andrew.
[02:15.820 --> 02:20.500]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16.
[02:21.060 --> 02:24.640]  21 is Eric, Gavin, Jeff, Nick, Andrew.
[02:25.240 --> 02:26.660]  22, 23, 24.
[02:27.300 --> 02:28.800]  Eric, Andrew, Jeff, Gavin, Nick.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.640]  Oh no, I don't want to be first.
[02:30.840 --> 02:31.400]  Here we go.
[02:32.440 --> 02:32.960]  25.
[02:33.260 --> 02:36.100]  Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Jeff.
[02:36.460 --> 02:37.840]  Oh, middle, I like the middle.
[02:38.540 --> 02:39.060]  Interesting.
[02:39.580 --> 02:40.720]  Very interesting.
[02:41.280 --> 02:42.460]  G's on the ends.
[02:42.880 --> 02:43.660]  G bookends.
[02:44.240 --> 02:44.520]  Yeah.
[02:44.740 --> 02:46.000]  The end cap, G caps.
[02:46.360 --> 02:47.240]  It's a bookend.
[02:48.700 --> 02:49.660]  Oh man.
[02:49.660 --> 02:54.140]  Gavin, since this is your draft, you can lead us off first with your...
[02:54.140 --> 02:55.200]  He's leading the peeves.
[02:55.700 --> 02:56.060]  Peeve.
[02:56.740 --> 02:57.100]  Peeve!
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.160]  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm going to start off...
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.520]  I didn't really know how peeved to be about some of these.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.960]  Some of them I'm lightly peeved.
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.960]  And there's some major peeves, so I'm going to start with a lighter one.
[03:06.160 --> 03:09.720]  Why would you pick only slightly peeved pet peeves in your pet peeve draft?
[03:09.980 --> 03:11.660]  Wouldn't you want the maximum peeve?
[03:11.980 --> 03:14.100]  No, pet peeves are slight peeves, typically.
[03:14.560 --> 03:16.560]  Oh, I might not know what a pet peeve is.
[03:16.840 --> 03:17.400]  This is going to be fun.
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.320]  I think I once again just discovered a new one.
[03:21.760 --> 03:23.260]  Ah, what?
[03:23.480 --> 03:24.680]  What did you think?
[03:25.440 --> 03:31.000]  Mild annoyance to maximum aggravation for the person is how I interpret a pet peeve.
[03:31.080 --> 03:33.140]  So you're going to pick like famines or something?
[03:33.600 --> 03:36.540]  No, that's a severe problem.
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.880]  My number one pet peeve is famine.
[03:39.140 --> 03:41.040]  My number two is pestilence.
[03:42.220 --> 03:46.420]  A pet peeve should be a minor annoyance or inconvenience
[03:46.420 --> 03:48.580]  that causes an outsized reaction in you.
[03:48.740 --> 03:49.780]  Yes, exactly.
[03:50.140 --> 03:51.820]  I'm adding pedantic to my list.
[03:52.160 --> 03:55.640]  So the concept of having a mild pet peeve is just I don't get it.
[03:55.700 --> 03:59.000]  But well, I've just got one like turbo peeve and the rest of pet peeves.
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.500]  So this is my first pet peeve.
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.740]  What's a turbo peeve?
[04:03.400 --> 04:05.140]  Outside of what your uncle was.
[04:09.900 --> 04:13.560]  That's just such a for us joke.
[04:17.060 --> 04:19.060]  It doesn't make any sense for this.
[04:19.080 --> 04:20.620]  That's the joke of the year.
[04:20.960 --> 04:22.080]  Who cares, dude?
[04:23.920 --> 04:24.960]  Oh, man.
[04:25.280 --> 04:26.440]  Oh, that is fantastic.
[04:26.980 --> 04:28.060]  God, that's great.
[04:28.560 --> 04:34.860]  I'm going to start with full email and password sign in with two-factor authentication using
[04:34.860 --> 04:36.040]  a TV remote.
[04:37.460 --> 04:40.360]  I don't know why I've never signed into Max.
[04:40.580 --> 04:42.300]  I'm constantly signed out of Hulu.
[04:42.700 --> 04:44.240]  What do you want from me?
[04:44.440 --> 04:45.780]  Give me a QR code.
[04:45.780 --> 04:46.600]  You idiot.
[04:46.820 --> 04:48.620]  Yeah, I think that's pretty good.
[04:48.680 --> 04:49.580]  I love that.
[04:49.660 --> 04:51.360]  I think a lot of them are doing QR code.
[04:51.420 --> 04:53.360]  But yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.660]  I think that's such a good one.
[04:54.720 --> 04:57.920]  Yeah, no, it's annoying for sure.
[04:57.980 --> 05:04.040]  Well, it's the worst when you want to just watch something.
[05:04.180 --> 05:08.680]  You are settled into like the couch and then you go and you have been signed out of that
[05:08.680 --> 05:10.940]  thing and then you have to sign in.
[05:11.020 --> 05:13.700]  But you the password you think you've put in right.
[05:13.700 --> 05:16.340]  And so you have now you have to reset the password because it's wrong.
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.760]  And it's now you have like all these extra steps to watch the dumbest TV in the world
[05:21.760 --> 05:23.620]  like that is brutal.
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.600]  I feel like an additional layer.
[05:25.780 --> 05:34.600]  When I set up Amazon Prime on my box, I feel like it did both, which was maximum aggravation
[05:34.600 --> 05:39.180]  where it made me sign into the account via the remote, did all that stuff.
[05:39.200 --> 05:41.820]  And then it says, hey, you got to sync this to your account.
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.180]  Use your phone to sign in.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.380]  Just let me do both.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.420]  Let me do one.
[05:48.540 --> 05:49.200]  I just need one.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.160]  I forget paying more for ads.
[05:51.280 --> 05:54.480]  I want to pay a dollar more just to never be signed out.
[05:54.520 --> 05:55.460]  Yeah, don't touch me.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.380]  Don't look at me.
[05:56.460 --> 05:58.420]  You would pay a premium for less security.
[05:58.760 --> 05:59.700]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[06:00.100 --> 06:00.240]  Yeah.
[06:00.500 --> 06:02.720]  Well, so we're going to watch my shows.
[06:05.920 --> 06:08.180]  I mean, it would be you say that jokingly.
[06:08.220 --> 06:09.760]  That would become a pet peeve pretty quick.
[06:09.820 --> 06:12.500]  I feel like if all the shows you're trying to watch this, finish them.
[06:12.500 --> 06:14.120]  You never know where you left off.
[06:14.680 --> 06:16.800]  It doesn't delete them when they finish them, though.
[06:17.100 --> 06:18.540]  No, but it fills the bar fills.
[06:18.760 --> 06:19.240]  Yeah, it does.
[06:19.500 --> 06:22.980]  You know, like I'm always trying to figure out what episode of Southern Charm I'm on right now.
[06:23.320 --> 06:25.460]  It's because Emily go to sleep during them.
[06:25.720 --> 06:30.460]  Well, that's a great out the gate pick for your peeve, Gavin and Nick.
[06:30.520 --> 06:31.660]  You have the next one.
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.780]  Gentlemen, I am going with Supreme pizzas at parties.
[06:38.340 --> 06:39.580]  Follow me on this.
[06:40.060 --> 06:42.220]  Inevitably, I'm not following you anywhere on this.
[06:42.760 --> 06:43.500]  No, no, no.
[06:43.580 --> 06:44.360]  Listen, listen, listen.
[06:44.480 --> 06:45.620]  I like a spring pizza, too.
[06:45.660 --> 06:47.320]  But here's the problem with Supreme pizza, right?
[06:47.740 --> 06:54.340]  As a result, the person does not often get an equatable amount of pepperoni or cheese
[06:54.340 --> 06:56.980]  or whatever else meat lovers to that, right?
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.020]  So there's like two of each of those pizzas, right?
[06:59.060 --> 07:05.760]  And inevitably, at least 60% of the party goers do not like something on a Supreme pizza,
[07:05.980 --> 07:08.040]  whether it be onion or bell pepper or whatever.
[07:08.040 --> 07:14.660]  And as a result, they all hoard the pepperoni, the cheese, the meat lovers.
[07:14.880 --> 07:19.900]  And it's left to us who actually tolerate the okay Supreme pizza to have those slices.
[07:20.180 --> 07:25.880]  And then we're out of the stuff we truly want, the meat lovers, the pepperoni, the cheese.
[07:26.100 --> 07:30.820]  And we have to sit there and watch as these people who don't like those things get to enjoy
[07:30.820 --> 07:32.600]  the pizza you actually want.
[07:33.420 --> 07:34.740]  And that is my pet peeve.
[07:35.660 --> 07:36.840]  You're getting 100.
[07:37.060 --> 07:40.720]  This is 100% eat Nick coming out in this show right now.
[07:40.860 --> 07:42.700]  This is like, these are like strong.
[07:42.780 --> 07:45.420]  This is great because that's such a strong food opinion for something
[07:45.420 --> 07:49.120]  I've never really thought about ever in my life.
[07:49.480 --> 07:49.580]  Absolutely.
[07:50.220 --> 07:56.020]  Have you guys ever seen that podcast of like the four 12-year-old kids that review food?
[07:56.820 --> 07:58.200]  Nick is those kids.
[07:59.420 --> 08:02.360]  Nick's the kid going, I've never had a carrot and you can't make me try one.
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.480]  That's not true, I love carrots.
[08:04.840 --> 08:06.040]  What a picnic.
[08:06.580 --> 08:07.020]  Picnic.
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.620]  Writing that down for nicknames next year.
[08:11.300 --> 08:14.040]  Only supreme pizzas at my parties from here on out.
[08:14.040 --> 08:14.440]  I got it.
[08:14.840 --> 08:16.200]  That's fine because I still get pizza.
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.020]  Dude, if you don't like all the ingredients on a supreme pizza,
[08:19.120 --> 08:21.500]  you need to get right with God because they're all delicious.
[08:21.960 --> 08:22.460]  I agree.
[08:22.620 --> 08:24.560]  However, sometimes I just want a pepperoni piece.
[08:25.160 --> 08:25.860]  Just saying.
[08:26.100 --> 08:26.720]  And they're all gone.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.260]  You and all the 12-year-olds.
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.880]  What'd you have for lunch yesterday, Nick?
[08:30.380 --> 08:31.660]  The leftover supreme pizza.
[08:31.780 --> 08:32.000]  Okay.
[08:35.640 --> 08:36.900]  But I also had mushrooms.
[08:37.080 --> 08:38.860]  Did you write this one down right after that, Nick?
[08:40.420 --> 08:41.540]  No, it wasn't a party.
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.120]  I wasn't mad.
[08:42.260 --> 08:42.460]  Okay.
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.820]  So look at, they cursed me with all these delicious ingredients.
[08:47.120 --> 08:50.000]  Now I have to suffer through all these amazing flavors.
[08:50.400 --> 08:52.840]  Sometimes I want a meat lovers.
[08:53.240 --> 08:56.160]  I feel like from everything you described, I would go straight for the supreme.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.560]  Yeah, I'd start with it.
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.700]  But then you want just the pepperoni?
[09:01.080 --> 09:01.480]  Yeah.
[09:02.080 --> 09:02.900]  Oh, man.
[09:03.120 --> 09:06.280]  I think Nick's pet peeve just might be not ordering enough pizzas.
[09:06.620 --> 09:08.200]  Yes, that is absolutely what it is.
[09:08.280 --> 09:10.540]  No, because there's always leftover supreme pizza.
[09:10.680 --> 09:12.440]  And there's not enough of the other pizza.
[09:12.520 --> 09:14.860]  There's a, there's a, there's an undercurrent here.
[09:15.260 --> 09:18.400]  What Nick isn't expressly saying, but what he's conveying
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.680]  is that his real problem is with the vegetables on the pizza.
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.020]  Because he wants more cheese.
[09:23.100 --> 09:23.960]  He wants more pepperoni.
[09:24.020 --> 09:24.980]  He wants more meat lovers.
[09:25.400 --> 09:27.800]  All those things are on the supreme pizza.
[09:28.020 --> 09:30.460]  The only thing that's on the supreme pizza that he's not mentioning
[09:30.460 --> 09:32.860]  are all the green things that are actually good for you.
[09:33.160 --> 09:34.260]  Fuck, I want a pizza now.
[09:34.460 --> 09:35.860]  Yeah, the good for you pizza.
[09:36.060 --> 09:38.380]  Shit, the good, the good for you pizza.
[09:40.120 --> 09:44.320]  Um, Andrew, we have, uh, we have pizza opinions going on here.
[09:44.320 --> 09:45.980]  But what's your, what's your peeve?
[09:46.300 --> 09:47.040]  Oh, my peeve.
[09:47.080 --> 09:48.920]  This one really grinds my gears.
[09:49.260 --> 09:50.680]  Oh, boy, boy.
[09:50.800 --> 09:53.500]  I'm getting heated just thinking about it.
[09:53.700 --> 09:58.500]  My first pet peeve in the first round is when people expect you
[09:58.500 --> 10:02.060]  to do a tail sync in a video that's less than 10 minutes long.
[10:02.120 --> 10:03.500]  Oh, my God.
[10:03.720 --> 10:05.360]  How can I continue?
[10:05.880 --> 10:06.900]  Jesus Christ.
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.780]  It's so infuriating.
[10:09.260 --> 10:10.060]  I mean, what?
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.820]  I'm supposed to do that just because they're concerned about the security of the recording?
[10:15.360 --> 10:16.660]  No, that's ridiculous.
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.980]  Nothing can go wrong in under 10 minutes.
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.400]  I refuse to do it.
[10:20.520 --> 10:21.540]  I'll never do it.
[10:21.760 --> 10:22.800]  It's outrageous.
[10:23.140 --> 10:24.840]  Oh, I'm just so mad about it.
[10:25.660 --> 10:28.260]  Okay, I'm just going to quickly add in a new peeve here.
[10:30.180 --> 10:31.300]  Oh, it's infuriating.
[10:32.360 --> 10:34.640]  Might be a little inside baseball for people.
[10:34.760 --> 10:37.960]  I know that's kind of specific to my life, but...
[10:37.960 --> 10:38.080]  Oh, man.
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.140]  Oh, I can't stand when people expect me to do a tail sync.
[10:43.620 --> 10:44.420]  Oh, God.
[10:44.840 --> 10:45.860]  Countdown from five.
[10:45.960 --> 10:46.740]  Fuck you.
[10:47.280 --> 10:50.460]  I will, you know, I might have to counter this in my next peeve.
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.240]  Well, we'll be able to get around there because it is a snake draft,
[10:54.240 --> 10:58.400]  but you're going to have to wait for your peeve to counter Andrew.
[10:58.560 --> 11:00.820]  And I'm so curious about what his second is going to be.
[11:01.760 --> 11:02.820]  I'll go next.
[11:03.320 --> 11:04.980]  Mine's a pretty simple one.
[11:05.920 --> 11:06.640]  Unexpected updates.
[11:07.380 --> 11:10.420]  When you are sitting down and you...
[11:10.420 --> 11:10.960]  Oh, dude, I'm fine.
[11:11.020 --> 11:11.880]  I'm a place of Call of Duty.
[11:12.080 --> 11:12.600]  Oh, never mind.
[11:13.180 --> 11:13.820]  Oh, it's cool.
[11:13.900 --> 11:14.660]  I'm going to...
[11:14.660 --> 11:15.460]  I'm going to watch...
[11:15.460 --> 11:16.580]  I'm going to watch something on Max.
[11:16.720 --> 11:17.280]  Oh, never mind.
[11:17.720 --> 11:18.140]  Oh, cool.
[11:18.180 --> 11:18.440]  All right.
[11:18.460 --> 11:20.100]  Well, just got to get some work done on this computer.
[11:20.300 --> 11:23.320]  Oh, Windows needs to reboot because of the update that just occurred.
[11:23.320 --> 11:24.740]  There's no way for me to stop it.
[11:24.980 --> 11:25.460]  Okay.
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.520]  Unexpected updates are a thing that I'm sure are helping me in some way, shape or form,
[11:32.540 --> 11:37.200]  but I only see the negative in them and hardly ever the positive.
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.700]  I hate it.
[11:38.820 --> 11:43.260]  The worst part about it is that most things have an option to like,
[11:43.400 --> 11:45.520]  oh, do you want to auto update at like 3 a.m.?
[11:45.520 --> 11:45.720]  Yep.
[11:46.040 --> 11:48.400]  I'm constantly waking up to messages that are like,
[11:48.540 --> 11:50.240]  oh, we couldn't install the update last night.
[11:50.800 --> 11:50.980]  Yeah.
[11:51.220 --> 11:52.280]  What's the point?
[11:52.480 --> 11:52.740]  Yep.
[11:52.740 --> 11:55.020]  Just do it when I'm not using it, you idiot.
[11:55.380 --> 11:55.580]  Yep.
[11:56.160 --> 11:56.280]  Yep.
[11:56.620 --> 11:57.820]  Hey, this isn't your peeve.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.900]  Sorry, I'm peeved by that. It's a great pick.
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.920]  No, that's good. It's good to know that it's a universal thing.
[12:03.180 --> 12:06.000]  Like, I just, I hate it so much.
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.260]  Like, having to download something when you're ready to do that thing is just like,
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.480]  all right, I'll just...
[12:12.480 --> 12:13.980]  It feels like being a kid again.
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.960]  In a way where you're just like, well, I'll sit helplessly for a while and wait.
[12:20.340 --> 12:22.780]  Not like in a you-still-believe-magic-is-real,
[12:23.060 --> 12:25.100]  but more like you don't have control over your time.
[12:25.320 --> 12:30.460]  Well, at that time, that's when I go on r slash black magic fuckery to see if magic is real.
[12:30.680 --> 12:32.220]  So I have some time to check it out.
[12:32.560 --> 12:33.480]  But that's my peeve.
[12:33.740 --> 12:37.780]  And Jeff, you have two peeves in a row because you're the end of the snake
[12:37.780 --> 12:39.420]  and you got to Earl Burrows this thing.
[12:39.520 --> 12:42.760]  First off, sat down, I thought, do I even have pet peeves?
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.360]  I started with the collab one and I thought, well,
[12:45.380 --> 12:47.280]  I won't even use that because that's been covered in content.
[12:47.280 --> 12:50.360]  And then I realized very quickly that I have a number of pet peeves,
[12:50.400 --> 12:52.940]  and I'm afraid that one draft isn't going to do it.
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.120]  I would actually like to expressly request at the end of the draft,
[12:57.260 --> 13:00.220]  we don't list our like, uh, our alternates,
[13:00.220 --> 13:03.000]  because I think we should all save them for a future pet peeve draft.
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.040]  Because I think I could personally field three or four or six or eight of these.
[13:07.160 --> 13:10.740]  Okay. And so initially you sat down and went, do I have any of these?
[13:10.760 --> 13:13.940]  Yeah. Yeah. And then I found out I hate everything and everyone.
[13:14.500 --> 13:15.800]  God, I don't even know where to start.
[13:15.800 --> 13:18.060]  I'm going to pick a specific one because it annoyed me recently.
[13:18.740 --> 13:20.520]  So this would be my first peeve.
[13:20.680 --> 13:26.160]  This is when you, when you book a hotel room via an app or the internet,
[13:26.160 --> 13:28.860]  and they say, would you like virtual check-in?
[13:29.020 --> 13:31.340]  And you go, yeah, because I don't like to talk to people.
[13:31.600 --> 13:33.340]  And I find the process of checking,
[13:33.580 --> 13:37.140]  the process of checking into a hotel in itself is a pet peeve
[13:37.140 --> 13:40.980]  because of the 75 hours of typing that they have to do
[13:40.980 --> 13:43.380]  to put in or in your last name, right?
[13:43.980 --> 13:45.220]  And run your credit card.
[13:45.220 --> 13:48.980]  So when they say, would you like to, would you like to check in virtually
[13:48.980 --> 13:51.420]  via the app or the Hilton app or the Merit app?
[13:51.460 --> 13:53.700]  I go, oh my God, that's a fucking godsend.
[13:53.720 --> 13:56.160]  So you go through the process and it's like, do you want a virtual key?
[13:56.240 --> 13:56.780]  And you go, yes.
[13:56.880 --> 13:58.060]  And one of two things happens.
[13:58.100 --> 14:01.220]  It goes, oh, sorry, virtual keys aren't available for this location.
[14:01.300 --> 14:03.520]  Or it goes, ah, there was an unexplained error.
[14:03.780 --> 14:06.560]  Just check in at the front desk and they'll give you your key.
[14:06.860 --> 14:08.860]  Or they'll say, yeah, the key's not available.
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.600]  Virtual key's not available for this hotel.
[14:10.680 --> 14:12.020]  So check in the front desk and they'll give you your key.
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.820]  So then you go to the front desk when you get there and you go,
[14:13.880 --> 14:14.780]  yeah, I just need to pick up my key.
[14:14.780 --> 14:16.080]  And they go, are you checking in?
[14:16.140 --> 14:17.360]  And I go, no, I checked in on the app.
[14:17.380 --> 14:18.560]  And they go, what's your last name, sir?
[14:18.920 --> 14:19.640]  You go, Ramsey.
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.640]  And they go, can I see your ID?
[14:20.720 --> 14:22.200]  And you're like, oh my God.
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.440]  And then you give them your ID.
[14:23.500 --> 14:25.360]  And then they go, sir, we need to have a credit card on file.
[14:25.380 --> 14:26.860]  And you go, don't you?
[14:26.900 --> 14:28.400]  And they go, but we need to run one physically.
[14:28.440 --> 14:28.880]  And I go, OK.
[14:28.920 --> 14:29.700]  And then you give them.
[14:29.700 --> 14:33.000]  And then the next thing you know, you're still checking into the fucking hotel.
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.100]  So why did you collect my information via app?
[14:36.340 --> 14:38.200]  Why did you waste my time via app?
[14:38.380 --> 14:41.280]  Why did I have to enter my credit card information in via the fucking app?
[14:41.460 --> 14:42.660]  You didn't do shit for me.
[14:42.660 --> 14:48.380]  You just made me double the amount of work I gotta do to stay in your hotel.
[14:49.560 --> 14:50.980]  That's my first pet peeve.
[14:51.060 --> 14:52.300]  That's a strong pet peeve.
[14:52.340 --> 14:52.940]  That's a good one.
[14:53.260 --> 14:54.340]  That's a strong pet peeve.
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.200]  That's a real good one.
[14:56.400 --> 14:59.320]  And again, you sat down and went, I don't know if I have any of these.
[15:01.560 --> 15:01.920]  Wow.
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.020]  Wow.
[15:03.080 --> 15:04.060]  It goes right back to you.
[15:04.480 --> 15:05.160]  Yeah, number two.
[15:05.220 --> 15:05.440]  Yeah.
[15:05.480 --> 15:06.380]  Let me take a second to get it.
[15:06.560 --> 15:07.640]  Yeah, no, you gotta get it.
[15:07.680 --> 15:08.020]  That was a lot.
[15:08.260 --> 15:08.420]  Catch your breath, buddy.
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.440]  Catch your breath.
[15:10.420 --> 15:12.540]  I don't like it when I'm in public.
[15:12.540 --> 15:18.760]  In a store, at a grocery store, in a mall, in any place in public where there are other
[15:18.760 --> 15:25.140]  people who also are navigating these same lanes and spaces and they are completely and
[15:25.140 --> 15:35.960]  totally oblivious and unaware to every other human being, every breathing mouth, every
[15:35.960 --> 15:37.960]  beating heart around them doesn't exist.
[15:37.960 --> 15:43.420]  And they amble through the dead middle of everywhere they go, either with a cart or
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.080]  with eighteen hundred fucking bags.
[15:45.260 --> 15:46.100]  And they're walking.
[15:47.240 --> 15:48.000]  They're walking.
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.600]  Honestly, they're walking like they're walking to their death.
[15:50.620 --> 15:54.020]  And they're like, I got to make this take as much time as humanly possible because when
[15:54.020 --> 15:56.040]  I get to point B, they're going to hang me.
[15:56.240 --> 16:00.120]  So I got to walk as slowly and maybe I'll walk a little to the right and then I'll walk
[16:00.120 --> 16:02.480]  a little to the left and then I'll walk a little to the right again.
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.360]  And I will never at any point look behind me even slightly to find out that there is
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.160]  a traffic jam of eighty seven people that just want to buy cereal.
[16:12.640 --> 16:14.480]  So that's my other pet peeve.
[16:14.660 --> 16:17.420]  Oh man, Jeff.
[16:17.560 --> 16:19.500]  Um, yeah, that is infuriating.
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.060]  I've seen that happen to Eric.
[16:21.500 --> 16:26.680]  It happens all the obliviousness of people in the world.
[16:26.860 --> 16:33.700]  Costco is so the place for that, where it is like, wow, man, this parking lot is like,
[16:33.860 --> 16:34.380]  what a mess.
[16:34.440 --> 16:35.080]  This is crazy.
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.860]  And then you get inside and you go, all the people who didn't know how to drive also don't
[16:38.860 --> 16:39.640]  know how to walk.
[16:41.260 --> 16:42.680]  How did this happen?
[16:42.800 --> 16:43.500]  It is the word.
[16:43.580 --> 16:45.000]  I'm so with you on that one, Jeff.
[16:45.120 --> 16:45.860]  Big style.
[16:46.180 --> 16:46.600]  I hate it.
[16:47.120 --> 16:48.560]  My next one is easy.
[16:48.740 --> 16:51.820]  And this is a big pet peeve for me personally.
[16:51.860 --> 16:54.000]  And it is so ingrained in me.
[16:54.100 --> 16:56.820]  And I think we've talked about this, Jeff, but being late.
[16:59.100 --> 17:00.860]  I despise it.
[17:01.140 --> 17:04.340]  I hate being late.
[17:04.340 --> 17:08.380]  I am early as often as I can be.
[17:08.700 --> 17:12.180]  I hate being late to stuff.
[17:12.300 --> 17:13.400]  It's just, it's miserable.
[17:13.820 --> 17:15.280]  It fucks everything up.
[17:15.400 --> 17:19.660]  I feel like there's like an expectation that you're like letting people down by being late
[17:19.660 --> 17:21.200]  to something as like a group thing.
[17:21.560 --> 17:23.540]  I don't, I just, let me just be on time.
[17:23.640 --> 17:29.040]  The only thing that I will be late for is parties because that's not the same thing as
[17:29.040 --> 17:34.000]  being, going to like a restaurant reservation or something like going to a house party.
[17:34.000 --> 17:34.800]  Totally different.
[17:35.200 --> 17:39.500]  So being late is, uh, myself, myself being late and others being late.
[17:39.620 --> 17:40.340]  I don't like late.
[17:40.780 --> 17:41.980]  Couldn't, couldn't agree with you more.
[17:42.100 --> 17:45.620]  When I, when I joined the army at 17, one of the first things they taught you is that
[17:45.620 --> 17:47.920]  if you aren't 15 minutes early, you're late.
[17:48.040 --> 17:48.440]  Oh yeah.
[17:48.480 --> 17:50.120]  And they, they really drill that into you.
[17:50.340 --> 17:50.520]  Yeah.
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.960]  It's definitely stuck with me.
[17:52.040 --> 17:53.780]  I've just always been that guy.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.260]  Pleasantries are great.
[17:55.560 --> 17:56.680]  Love a little pleasantries.
[17:56.880 --> 17:57.440]  Be early.
[17:58.080 --> 17:58.600]  Be early.
[17:58.900 --> 17:59.920]  You're ready to go.
[17:59.920 --> 18:03.860]  You don't want the stress of like, oh, I got to get everything together at the last
[18:03.860 --> 18:04.240]  minute.
[18:04.360 --> 18:04.940]  It's terrible.
[18:05.480 --> 18:05.880]  Absolutely.
[18:06.040 --> 18:07.380]  You're avoiding a rush.
[18:07.540 --> 18:07.960]  It's great.
[18:07.960 --> 18:11.020]  You don't want to be blowing through a door going, it's exactly 9am while you're putting
[18:11.020 --> 18:11.600]  your tie on.
[18:14.180 --> 18:17.940]  It's exactly, that's how I blow through a door going, it's exactly 9am.
[18:18.780 --> 18:19.580]  I'm still on time.

[19:03.310 --> 19:07.590]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[19:07.790 --> 19:11.310]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[19:11.630 --> 19:13.570]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[19:16.210 --> 19:17.530]  That's my second peeve.
[19:17.590 --> 19:19.010]  Andrew, what's your second peeve?
[19:19.330 --> 19:20.310]  My second peeve?
[19:20.390 --> 19:21.130]  Oh boy.
[19:22.330 --> 19:23.610]  Give me a minute.
[19:24.150 --> 19:24.730]  Gather myself.
[19:25.070 --> 19:25.770]  He's fired up.
[19:26.010 --> 19:27.410]  Oh, a little bad about it.
[19:27.530 --> 19:28.410]  It's been in content.
[19:28.570 --> 19:29.810]  We've discussed it before.
[19:29.810 --> 19:34.110]  But it is, oh, oh, really gets the gears grinding.
[19:34.490 --> 19:35.790]  The rust is flying off.
[19:36.250 --> 19:38.370]  I hate the word collab.
[19:38.910 --> 19:40.790]  Use the full word.
[19:41.310 --> 19:41.910]  Collaborate.
[19:42.190 --> 19:43.030]  Easy to do.
[19:43.310 --> 19:46.170]  Only a few extra letters, you lazy assholes.
[19:46.590 --> 19:47.190]  Collab.
[19:47.510 --> 19:48.270]  Who says that?
[19:48.570 --> 19:51.050]  Just a bunch of idiots who says that.
[19:51.230 --> 19:52.670]  Bet you they don't know how to walk either.
[19:52.970 --> 19:58.710]  Or also enjoy using phone email passwords, signing in with two-factor authentication on
[19:58.710 --> 19:59.390]  a TV remote.
[19:59.390 --> 20:00.770]  Bunch of fools.
[20:00.970 --> 20:02.050]  Fools, I tell you.
[20:04.410 --> 20:05.270]  That's pretty good.
[20:05.470 --> 20:06.190]  That's a good one.
[20:06.210 --> 20:06.530]  I agree.
[20:06.770 --> 20:07.890]  Yeah, I definitely agree.
[20:08.070 --> 20:08.690]  It's pretty strong.
[20:09.030 --> 20:10.710]  I'm just glad I'm not the only one.
[20:10.750 --> 20:12.210]  Yeah, I agree.
[20:12.450 --> 20:13.870]  Oh man, this is...
[20:14.810 --> 20:17.670]  I'm so curious to see where the rest of Andrew's pet peeves go.
[20:17.850 --> 20:18.430]  This is very...
[20:19.230 --> 20:21.550]  You know, I dug deep into my soul to find these.
[20:21.650 --> 20:22.070]  So this is...
[20:22.070 --> 20:23.050]  I really excavated.
[20:23.170 --> 20:23.610]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:23.690 --> 20:24.710]  No, yeah, absolutely, dude.
[20:24.790 --> 20:26.610]  Yeah, he's got two of four so far.
[20:26.950 --> 20:28.070]  You're halfway there for you, bud.
[20:28.070 --> 20:29.730]  But next, it's Nick.
[20:29.810 --> 20:31.450]  Nick, what is your next pet peeve?
[20:31.770 --> 20:33.970]  This is one Gavin may not know a lot about.
[20:34.130 --> 20:40.470]  But let's take a moment to acknowledge and shit on slow left lane drivers.
[20:40.770 --> 20:42.110]  Get out of the left lane.
[20:42.350 --> 20:43.530]  Get out of the left lane.
[20:43.770 --> 20:45.190]  You're obstructing traffic.
[20:45.750 --> 20:46.810]  Get out of the left lane.
[20:47.270 --> 20:51.030]  You are the reason that there is additional traffic.
[20:51.370 --> 20:52.630]  Oh, but I'm going to speed limit.
[20:52.770 --> 20:53.550]  Who gives a shit?
[20:53.710 --> 20:54.350]  Get out of the way.
[20:54.450 --> 20:55.270]  Do you want a fucking medal?
[20:55.770 --> 20:55.990]  Shut up.
[20:56.090 --> 20:56.550]  Left lane is for passing.
[20:56.970 --> 20:58.530]  That lane is for passing.
[20:58.770 --> 21:02.510]  There's a law in Texas that if you are not passing, you can be pulled over.
[21:02.610 --> 21:04.230]  And they don't do it often enough, I say.
[21:04.650 --> 21:05.470]  Get out of the left lane.
[21:05.730 --> 21:10.210]  Nick, I agree with you that in California, you're just in the left lane and you're cruising.
[21:10.270 --> 21:10.890]  Like you're flying.
[21:11.050 --> 21:12.210]  Like that's just that's what it is.
[21:12.230 --> 21:12.750]  Not for passing.
[21:12.830 --> 21:13.410]  It's just for going.
[21:13.930 --> 21:18.070]  But then I moved here and left lane is definitely for passing and not enough people use it.
[21:18.150 --> 21:19.030]  Not enough people do it.
[21:19.090 --> 21:20.190]  And too many people are in it.
[21:20.610 --> 21:20.790]  Yep.
[21:21.110 --> 21:25.610]  It is amazing how many times you see three cars driving perfectly in a line next to each
[21:25.610 --> 21:26.550]  other at the same speed.
[21:27.390 --> 21:32.190]  It's pretty miserable, especially when you have places to be because you don't want to be late.
[21:32.650 --> 21:32.870]  Yep.
[21:33.250 --> 21:33.650]  Crazy.
[21:34.210 --> 21:34.970]  Get out of the way.
[21:35.150 --> 21:35.530]  Get out of the way.
[21:35.730 --> 21:39.490]  Gavin, we're on to your second and then your third peeves.
[21:39.750 --> 21:42.390]  OK, well, I've had to insert an emergency peeve here.
[21:42.530 --> 21:43.690]  Oh, an emergency peeve.
[21:43.690 --> 21:44.350]  Oh, wow.
[21:45.410 --> 21:46.670]  As you may have expected.
[21:46.810 --> 21:51.990]  But my second peeve is people who have never edited a video in their life,
[21:51.990 --> 21:58.170]  insisting everyone do something completely unnecessary for editing purposes 30 times in a
[21:58.170 --> 21:58.490]  month.
[21:58.850 --> 21:59.610]  I agree.
[22:00.490 --> 22:01.770]  I feel strongly on this.
[22:02.270 --> 22:02.430]  Yep.
[22:02.590 --> 22:02.750]  What?
[22:04.090 --> 22:05.750]  As someone who has edited videos before.
[22:07.230 --> 22:08.050]  I'm with you.
[22:11.030 --> 22:14.110]  Yeah, it's just, uh, it's unnecessary stuff.
[22:14.330 --> 22:15.610]  Takes up time for no reason.
[22:15.690 --> 22:20.550]  I could be uploading the video already, but instead I'm sinking again for some reason.
[22:20.810 --> 22:21.530]  What is happening?
[22:21.990 --> 22:26.030]  That's especially annoying with is, you know, that's five seconds you could be used uploading,
[22:26.230 --> 22:27.630]  which I always do.
[22:27.830 --> 22:28.250]  Always do.
[22:28.330 --> 22:29.270]  Always make sure that upload is.
[22:29.510 --> 22:30.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:30.250 --> 22:31.170]  That's actually Andrew.
[22:31.290 --> 22:33.890]  Andrew, honestly, make a pretty good point, buddy.
[22:34.570 --> 22:37.770]  Well, maybe I'd be uploading if I wasn't still recording.
[22:39.490 --> 22:41.150]  You think that's the reason?
[22:42.450 --> 22:42.930]  Nope.
[22:46.890 --> 22:47.850]  No, no.
[22:49.150 --> 22:51.070]  OK, good emergency peeve.
[22:51.070 --> 22:52.190]  I like it.
[22:52.230 --> 22:52.730]  I like it.
[22:53.190 --> 22:55.310]  What is your third peeve, Gavin?
[22:55.770 --> 22:57.910]  Oh, you know what I really like?
[22:58.130 --> 23:00.790]  When I go on a website, right?
[23:01.130 --> 23:04.490]  I really like being asked about cookies all the time.
[23:04.550 --> 23:06.430]  I was just thinking this.
[23:06.570 --> 23:09.790]  I always have individual preferences across different websites.
[23:09.990 --> 23:12.710]  Sometimes I want them to save a cookie and sometimes I don't.
[23:15.750 --> 23:16.710]  Shut up!
[23:16.790 --> 23:18.290]  Let me do it on a browser level.
[23:18.290 --> 23:23.650]  Let me set one universal thing and just apply that to all the websites.
[23:24.190 --> 23:27.810]  I don't think I'm going to have different preferences based on different sites.
[23:28.470 --> 23:29.490]  I just want to eat all the cookies.
[23:29.730 --> 23:31.070]  I was literally thinking this last night.
[23:31.130 --> 23:32.530]  Why can't I just eat all the cookies?
[23:32.910 --> 23:33.450]  Don't ask me.
[23:33.830 --> 23:34.530]  I'll eat the cookies.
[23:35.070 --> 23:36.510]  Don't ask me that.
[23:37.230 --> 23:40.170]  It's it is a it's like an epidemic right now.
[23:40.390 --> 23:41.010]  It's insane.
[23:41.310 --> 23:42.110]  Why is that?
[23:42.150 --> 23:42.630]  Do we know?
[23:42.730 --> 23:44.630]  Do we know why it's happening everywhere all the time now?
[23:44.630 --> 23:50.850]  I think some European law passed that meant that people couldn't do it without asking.
[23:51.130 --> 23:52.310]  So now they ask everyone ever.
[23:52.650 --> 23:55.070]  Do you think there's anyone that refuses to give cookies?
[23:55.190 --> 23:56.530]  Like, what websites do they go on?
[23:57.010 --> 23:57.810]  How do they navigate?
[23:58.290 --> 24:02.990]  And I think the reason it keeps asking you is because it's not saving a cookie.
[24:03.330 --> 24:05.070]  I think it's like a little bit circular.
[24:06.970 --> 24:12.310]  How about, Nick, you get us out of cookie conversation and you let us know what your peeve is.
[24:12.630 --> 24:13.810]  I'm going to take us back to nature.
[24:14.630 --> 24:21.910]  How often have you been, let's say, in a public park, maybe hiking the trail going along the way,
[24:21.970 --> 24:22.170]  right?
[24:22.370 --> 24:23.650]  Come to a fork in the road.
[24:24.170 --> 24:24.990]  It's beautiful, right?
[24:25.050 --> 24:25.750]  There's trees.
[24:25.910 --> 24:26.570]  There's green.
[24:27.010 --> 24:27.710]  Oh, there's the river.
[24:28.110 --> 24:29.470]  Oh, what's what's that in the river?
[24:29.530 --> 24:30.890]  What's that by the riverbank right there?
[24:31.350 --> 24:33.650]  Is that a massive turd?
[24:34.230 --> 24:36.810]  Pick up your dog's shit.
[24:37.670 --> 24:41.790]  If you are out and about, pick up your dog shit.
[24:42.170 --> 24:43.210]  I don't want to step in it.
[24:43.250 --> 24:44.130]  I don't want to fall in it.
[24:44.130 --> 24:45.890]  I don't want my dog trying to sniff it.
[24:46.310 --> 24:47.190]  Pick up your dog shit.
[24:47.490 --> 24:48.090]  It's everywhere.
[24:48.290 --> 24:49.870]  That would rank much higher than a peeve for me.
[24:49.970 --> 24:52.450]  That's just like awful biohazards.
[24:52.910 --> 24:56.750]  It's interesting because it is a it's a pet peeve in two ways, too.
[24:56.850 --> 24:59.470]  Yeah, it's true.
[25:00.110 --> 25:01.250]  A pet peeve.
[25:01.350 --> 25:02.170]  A pet-related peeve.
[25:02.310 --> 25:03.250]  Yep, it is.
[25:03.250 --> 25:04.690]  That's just good to have on the board.
[25:05.210 --> 25:06.130]  That's a dog peeve.
[25:07.870 --> 25:09.110]  I like that one.
[25:09.750 --> 25:11.490]  Andrew, can you top it with your next?
[25:11.490 --> 25:15.350]  Oh, I don't I don't think I can top a pet, a literal pet peeve.
[25:15.370 --> 25:20.470]  OK, but what I can submit is a deep, deep frustration, deep annoyance.
[25:21.490 --> 25:24.910]  People tagging me that I don't know in any way.
[25:25.150 --> 25:26.210]  Can't stand it.
[25:26.310 --> 25:27.270]  Don't like it.
[25:27.470 --> 25:29.830]  If I'm on TikTok, I don't know you.
[25:29.930 --> 25:30.970]  Don't tag me, man.
[25:31.170 --> 25:31.730]  Don't tag me.
[25:31.730 --> 25:33.050]  That's my fortress of solitude.
[25:33.450 --> 25:36.110]  I'm here to just watch some dumb videos.
[25:36.310 --> 25:37.470]  I'm here to have a good time.
[25:37.710 --> 25:39.450]  I don't need to know what you think is good.
[25:39.510 --> 25:40.330]  I don't know you.
[25:40.330 --> 25:41.850]  I don't care about your opinions.
[25:42.150 --> 25:42.410]  Yep.
[25:42.790 --> 25:43.350]  Get out of here.
[25:43.610 --> 25:44.230]  Get out of here.
[25:44.490 --> 25:44.930]  That's crazy.
[25:45.070 --> 25:46.770]  That was going to be my next peeve.
[25:46.890 --> 25:49.170]  And you got it right up from under me.
[25:49.190 --> 25:49.870]  Way to go, man.
[25:50.230 --> 25:51.190]  I can't believe that.
[25:51.410 --> 25:51.610]  Wow.
[25:51.750 --> 25:52.690]  Don't at me, peeve.
[25:52.890 --> 25:54.170]  Don't at me is a great way.
[25:55.250 --> 25:56.250]  I just don't.
[25:56.350 --> 25:57.090]  That's why I'm going to change that.
[25:57.210 --> 25:57.850]  Don't at me.
[25:58.190 --> 26:01.570]  I just don't get how I could.
[26:01.850 --> 26:05.610]  I can't be more clear about don't do it.
[26:05.750 --> 26:07.490]  And then people go, right.
[26:07.590 --> 26:08.850]  I can't believe they do that anyway.
[26:08.850 --> 26:10.330]  Hey, dude, you got to check this out.
[26:10.410 --> 26:14.830]  And it's like, do you think this doesn't apply to who do you think you are?
[26:15.190 --> 26:16.450]  What are you talking about?
[26:16.550 --> 26:17.470]  This is a one-way street.
[26:17.610 --> 26:18.210]  It goes out.
[26:18.510 --> 26:19.170]  Leave it that way.
[26:19.370 --> 26:20.130]  This is it.
[26:20.270 --> 26:21.010]  That's all I want.
[26:21.070 --> 26:22.170]  Just don't at me ever.
[26:22.370 --> 26:23.790]  Is this mainly a TikTok thing?
[26:24.190 --> 26:25.270]  No, this is everything.
[26:25.450 --> 26:26.410]  This is all the time.
[26:26.570 --> 26:31.150]  A guy literally just messaged me and said, dude, I have an idea for such a funny shirt.
[26:31.910 --> 26:33.310]  What are you doing?
[26:33.610 --> 26:34.730]  Leave me alone.
[26:34.890 --> 26:35.110]  What?
[26:35.290 --> 26:36.350]  Who are you?
[26:36.670 --> 26:37.670]  Leave me alone.
[26:37.670 --> 26:40.090]  Leave me alone.
[26:40.290 --> 26:41.290]  Talk to anyone else.
[26:41.570 --> 26:42.090]  That's crazy.
[26:42.810 --> 26:44.370]  I don't agree with this one at all.
[26:44.770 --> 26:47.230]  Should we rethink making Eric head of customer service?
[26:48.730 --> 26:51.410]  Yeah, I don't know why I volunteered for that right out the gate.
[26:51.470 --> 26:52.630]  That was such a bad idea.
[26:52.910 --> 26:53.750]  That's on me.
[26:54.010 --> 27:00.010]  It is a level of annoyance to when it is like there are certain videos that it's like so
[27:00.010 --> 27:02.530]  obviously like, oh, one of you would love this.
[27:02.770 --> 27:04.330]  And I just don't send because they're popular.
[27:04.450 --> 27:05.770]  And I know that you've seen it already.
[27:05.770 --> 27:07.970]  And you've been sent it 50,000 times.
[27:08.090 --> 27:11.330]  And it's just like, I don't want to like, I know you would like this, but the odds of
[27:11.330 --> 27:13.090]  you having not seen it are so low.
[27:13.330 --> 27:13.510]  Yeah.
[27:13.670 --> 27:14.310]  Yeah, you saw it.
[27:14.450 --> 27:19.170]  Also, I'm online way more than people who are tagging me and stuff.
[27:19.430 --> 27:20.510]  So I've already seen it.
[27:20.970 --> 27:22.030]  Don't there's no need.
[27:22.110 --> 27:22.570]  I've seen it.
[27:22.630 --> 27:23.210]  Don't worry about it.
[27:23.290 --> 27:24.870]  You see this lady on the grapes?
[27:25.230 --> 27:25.390]  Yeah.
[27:25.730 --> 27:26.650]  Dude, have you seen this?
[27:26.670 --> 27:27.910]  Dude, have you seen this Snoopy thing?
[27:28.110 --> 27:28.470]  Absolutely.
[27:29.490 --> 27:29.850]  100%.
[27:29.850 --> 27:30.650]  No, thanks, man.
[27:31.110 --> 27:31.870]  Leave me alone.
[27:32.030 --> 27:32.590]  Appreciate it.
[27:32.810 --> 27:34.730]  My next one actually has to do with TikTok.
[27:35.770 --> 27:44.670]  TikTok continuing to show me videos that I say not interested to.
[27:47.430 --> 27:52.430]  There is an option to say I am not interested.
[27:53.030 --> 27:56.150]  I am telling the app I'm not interested.
[27:56.410 --> 28:01.930]  And the app is going, I think I can change your mind about this one.
[28:01.930 --> 28:13.450]  And it wants to continue to show me like war videos, like the most insane shit.
[28:13.590 --> 28:16.010]  I'm trying to get on TikTok for very specific stuff.
[28:16.310 --> 28:19.370]  And the things it's trying to show me, I'm not interested in.
[28:19.470 --> 28:21.850]  And I try to tell it, hey, check out these people dancing.
[28:22.290 --> 28:25.210]  No, never in my life do I want to see these people dancing.
[28:25.410 --> 28:26.210]  That's not why I'm here.
[28:26.390 --> 28:31.150]  I'm here for the weird cartel videos shot on a Nokia phone.
[28:31.150 --> 28:32.750]  That's what I'm on TikTok for.
[28:32.850 --> 28:33.490]  Give me more of that.
[28:34.750 --> 28:35.150]  Yeah.
[28:35.330 --> 28:36.710]  Oh, do you not get cartel videos?
[28:37.190 --> 28:38.130]  I don't use TikTok.
[28:38.570 --> 28:39.990]  Oh, you're missing out.
[28:40.130 --> 28:45.290]  It's a lot of guys on speed boats that show you all like the bricks of stuff that they have in the back.
[28:46.110 --> 28:49.750]  It's so, it's so cool.
[28:50.010 --> 28:50.850]  It's the best.
[28:51.050 --> 28:52.750]  But I don't get enough of that.
[28:53.070 --> 28:54.930]  I get too many people dancing or whatever.
[28:54.930 --> 28:55.970]  And it's like, get this out of here.
[28:56.050 --> 28:56.630]  I don't want that.
[28:56.670 --> 28:58.090]  So TikTok, knock it off.
[28:58.390 --> 28:58.990]  That's mine.
[28:58.990 --> 29:04.190]  If this were a Reese's TV ad, you'd be staring at a Reese's peanut butter cup.
[29:04.850 --> 29:07.090]  And sure, my voice is peanut buttery smooth.
[29:07.290 --> 29:10.030]  But still, you need to see the peanut butter cups, right?
[29:10.590 --> 29:10.890]  No?
[29:11.170 --> 29:13.770]  I can really just say Reese's and you'll go get some?
[29:14.010 --> 29:14.550]  Okay.
[29:15.330 --> 29:15.890]  Reese's.
[29:16.470 --> 29:17.030]  Reese's.
[29:17.710 --> 29:18.270]  Reese's.
[29:18.450 --> 29:19.530]  They're really working, actually.
[29:20.230 --> 29:20.790]  Reese's.
[29:21.630 --> 29:22.190]  Reese's.
[29:22.450 --> 29:23.850]  This, I'm onto something.
[29:24.710 --> 29:25.270]  Reese's.
[29:26.110 --> 29:26.670]  Reese's.
[29:27.250 --> 29:27.810]  Reese's.
[29:29.990 --> 29:32.210]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.
[29:32.430 --> 29:35.150]  You know that moment when you just need to hit pause and refresh?
[29:35.730 --> 29:37.690]  An ice cold Diet Coke isn't just a break.
[29:37.830 --> 29:41.150]  It's your chance to catch your breath and savor a moment that's all about you.
[29:41.470 --> 29:42.370]  Always refreshing.
[29:42.710 --> 29:43.910]  Still the same great taste.
[29:44.410 --> 29:44.830]  Diet Coke.
[29:45.070 --> 29:46.230]  Make time for you time.
[29:48.170 --> 29:51.190]  And now, Jeff with his final two peeves.
[29:51.570 --> 29:57.490]  Okay, for number three, this is a pet peeve that I admittedly don't encounter often anymore
[29:57.490 --> 30:00.290]  because we are work from home these days.
[30:00.830 --> 30:05.090]  But I respect soda and I respect carbonation.
[30:05.390 --> 30:09.290]  And so when I work with people, and I don't want to call anyone out individually.
[30:09.290 --> 30:13.050]  I don't want to specifically name one person, Bernie Burns,
[30:13.890 --> 30:17.210]  who might do this and have done this in the past.
[30:17.210 --> 30:22.850]  But I can't fucking stand when you co-work with somebody and you share a refrigerator
[30:22.850 --> 30:25.790]  full of amazing, delicious sodas with somebody.
[30:25.790 --> 30:30.630]  Or maybe it's even like Waterloo Carbonated Waters or whatever.
[30:31.070 --> 30:31.810]  It doesn't have to be soda.
[30:32.050 --> 30:34.450]  Just a cold carbonated drink.
[30:34.810 --> 30:38.090]  And they take a drink out and they open it and they take a sip and then they put it down.
[30:38.210 --> 30:42.150]  And then they erase the existence of that drink from their memory.
[30:42.350 --> 30:45.490]  So that 30 minutes later when they're thirsty, they go,
[30:45.770 --> 30:50.410]  huh, and they go back into the fridge and they open up another Diet Dr Pepper and pop it open.
[30:50.470 --> 30:51.650]  And they take one sip of that.
[30:51.830 --> 30:52.910]  I have worked with some people.
[30:52.950 --> 30:55.150]  And once again, I don't want to call anybody out individually because I've
[30:55.150 --> 30:56.490]  hundreds and hundreds of people.
[30:56.630 --> 30:57.610]  Bernie exactly burns.
[30:57.970 --> 31:06.190]  But I've seen I've seen dudes destroy a 12 pack of Diet Coke in 14 sips.
[31:07.710 --> 31:10.950]  It's like a it's an assassination is what it is.
[31:11.010 --> 31:13.050]  And it's so wasteful.
[31:13.070 --> 31:17.510]  And then you're like, hey, hey, we don't need more Coke because you have seven over there.
[31:17.570 --> 31:18.450]  Just drink those.
[31:18.490 --> 31:21.090]  They go, oh, well, they're flat or oh, they're warm now.
[31:21.090 --> 31:27.290]  It's like, oh, maybe there should be tiny little shot sized six packs of cans.
[31:28.110 --> 31:29.330]  They kind of exist.
[31:29.370 --> 31:30.990]  Actually, they have the little have the minis.
[31:31.090 --> 31:31.290]  Yeah.
[31:32.410 --> 31:34.970]  Which are more expensive, but contain less liquid.
[31:35.050 --> 31:36.550]  I don't understand who the minis are for.
[31:36.830 --> 31:38.010]  I guess we know now.
[31:38.470 --> 31:40.250]  Anyway, lots of people have done that throughout the years.
[31:40.290 --> 31:43.210]  I don't want to call anybody individually, but it's something that's always bugged the
[31:43.210 --> 31:43.610]  shit out of me.
[31:43.630 --> 31:46.310]  It's so wasteful and disrespectful of carbonation.
[31:47.450 --> 31:49.010]  Disrespectful of carbonation,
[31:49.010 --> 31:51.090]  especially if they're not replenishing.
[31:51.370 --> 31:53.190]  Yeah. Is that a finite thing like helium?
[31:53.510 --> 31:54.750]  I don't want to find out, dude.
[31:54.850 --> 31:58.110]  What happens when we find out the world is running out of carbonation?
[31:58.410 --> 32:01.570]  Think of all the flat cokes that carbonation was wasted on.
[32:02.790 --> 32:03.230]  Ridiculous.
[32:04.010 --> 32:04.570]  All right.
[32:04.990 --> 32:09.450]  I guess my last one from my pile of 200 more pet peeves.
[32:10.110 --> 32:11.370]  I'm going to take this one.
[32:11.570 --> 32:16.770]  This is when you go out to a meal with friends or co-workers or whoever.
[32:16.770 --> 32:19.070]  You go out to maybe six, seven, eight people sitting around a table,
[32:19.590 --> 32:21.710]  and the waiter or waitress comes over and they say,
[32:21.750 --> 32:22.370]  can I take your drinks?
[32:22.410 --> 32:24.090]  And they go, yeah, I'll take Diet Coke, water.
[32:24.190 --> 32:26.610]  Everybody takes their drinks and they hand out menus and they say,
[32:26.990 --> 32:29.030]  I'll be back in a few minutes to take your order.
[32:29.370 --> 32:33.310]  And then five to nine, 12 minutes later, they come back and they go,
[32:33.370 --> 32:34.310]  is everybody ready to order?
[32:34.410 --> 32:36.930]  And three or four or five people all go, yeah.
[32:37.430 --> 32:41.710]  And then this person starts to take orders and they go, what would you like?
[32:41.730 --> 32:42.990]  And I'll take the mushroom Swiss burger.
[32:43.050 --> 32:43.590]  What would you like?
[32:43.690 --> 32:45.190]  I'll have the ravioli.
[32:45.290 --> 32:45.810]  What would you like?
[32:45.810 --> 32:47.010]  I'll take the soup, please.
[32:47.090 --> 32:47.490]  Gazpacho.
[32:47.710 --> 32:50.330]  And they go to you and they go, uh, oh, geez.
[32:50.510 --> 32:52.790]  Oh, man, I don't.
[32:53.030 --> 32:54.030]  Can you skip me?
[32:54.090 --> 32:54.970]  Come back to me later.
[32:56.070 --> 32:57.750]  What are you doing?
[32:58.350 --> 33:03.210]  Everybody has the same menu and the same allotted amount of time to figure out
[33:03.210 --> 33:04.150]  what you want to eat.
[33:04.310 --> 33:07.310]  You only like seven things on Earth anyway.
[33:07.470 --> 33:08.870]  Pick one of those seven things.
[33:09.150 --> 33:13.110]  Also, 98% of the time you've been here before, dickhead.
[33:13.270 --> 33:15.250]  You already know what you're going to order.
[33:15.250 --> 33:17.790]  And two, what's wrong with a little bit of preparation?
[33:18.070 --> 33:20.090]  You're sitting in the car in the Uber on the way over.
[33:20.390 --> 33:21.770]  Look up the menu ahead of time.
[33:22.010 --> 33:23.090]  Know what you're walking into.
[33:23.410 --> 33:25.150]  Have an idea of what might be good.
[33:25.250 --> 33:28.030]  Or I don't know, maybe make an on the spot decision.
[33:28.310 --> 33:31.590]  It's not, you're not, it's not Sophie's choice here.
[33:31.670 --> 33:34.290]  We're not picking which kid we're going to put a fucking bullet in.
[33:34.550 --> 33:37.970]  We're picking, do I want the mozzarella sticks or the chimichangas?
[33:38.910 --> 33:39.710]  Jesus Christ.
[33:39.830 --> 33:42.810]  And then also they give you a cheat sheet.
[33:42.810 --> 33:45.990]  It's in front of you and it's multiple choice.
[33:46.290 --> 33:48.730]  You don't have to write anything in.
[33:49.070 --> 33:51.450]  Just pick A, B, C or D.
[33:52.190 --> 33:54.550]  They give you a cheat sheet.
[33:54.970 --> 33:57.050]  Never thought of a menu as a cheat sheet.
[33:57.150 --> 33:57.910]  I like that.
[33:59.450 --> 34:01.030]  All right, it's my last.
[34:01.530 --> 34:03.830]  Imagine if there weren't menus and you just had to guess.
[34:03.990 --> 34:04.790]  You got to wing it.
[34:04.970 --> 34:05.890]  Yeah, can I get the ravioli?
[34:06.190 --> 34:07.610]  Ooh, we don't do that.
[34:08.290 --> 34:09.950]  Yeah, that's not what this is.
[34:09.950 --> 34:12.470]  Different restaurant, buddy.
[34:13.590 --> 34:14.530]  Let's see.
[34:14.670 --> 34:15.950]  It's down to my last one.
[34:16.090 --> 34:17.750]  This one's going to be a real simple one.
[34:18.130 --> 34:20.150]  This one's real straightforward to me.
[34:20.350 --> 34:22.290]  And it is a bad handshake.
[34:22.770 --> 34:26.090]  It makes me nuts.
[34:27.790 --> 34:29.190]  So specific.
[34:29.890 --> 34:31.950]  It happens so much.
[34:32.130 --> 34:33.430]  I hate it.
[34:33.850 --> 34:34.730]  It is miserable.
[34:34.730 --> 34:39.670]  So a thing in pro wrestling is when you get there and you go backstage,
[34:39.670 --> 34:41.530]  you're supposed to shake everyone's hand.
[34:41.650 --> 34:45.030]  It's a way where like, if you're out of town talent or whatever,
[34:45.070 --> 34:46.730]  it's a way to introduce you to everyone.
[34:46.890 --> 34:49.570]  And that's like, it's the easy way to like make that happen.
[34:50.110 --> 34:53.790]  The amount of times where I always do the handshake,
[34:53.830 --> 34:57.150]  but there are guys who do try to do like the fist bump.
[34:57.490 --> 35:01.010]  And then I change to the fist bump and they change to the handshake.
[35:01.010 --> 35:02.150]  It's like this.
[35:02.250 --> 35:05.470]  I'm like, just, just let's pretend like we never met.
[35:05.730 --> 35:07.690]  Let's just, I'm never going to see you again.
[35:07.870 --> 35:09.050]  Let's not worry about this one.
[35:09.130 --> 35:10.050]  And let's call it a day.
[35:10.230 --> 35:11.630]  That is, I hate it.
[35:11.710 --> 35:12.970]  It's a miserable thing.
[35:13.050 --> 35:18.810]  And then sometimes you get the handshake where they close too early or you close too early.
[35:18.810 --> 35:21.770]  And then you're just like, what, what is this?
[35:21.850 --> 35:24.590]  Like, we're just holding hands bad style.
[35:24.730 --> 35:25.430]  I hate it.
[35:25.570 --> 35:28.230]  And like, you're just holding fingers like a bundle of straws.
[35:28.230 --> 35:28.550]  Yep.
[35:28.710 --> 35:29.470]  It's the worst.
[35:29.730 --> 35:30.830]  I'm so with you, Eric.
[35:30.830 --> 35:34.830]  I had a handshake in 1995 that was so bad.
[35:35.050 --> 35:37.090]  I still think about it sometimes.
[35:37.410 --> 35:38.750]  It sticks with you, man.
[35:38.890 --> 35:41.230]  I'm going to do the handshake to you next time I see you.
[35:41.230 --> 35:45.650]  And it will blow your mind how bad this handshake was.
[35:46.050 --> 35:46.330]  Wow.
[35:46.390 --> 35:49.330]  It was the saddest, limpest, grossest thing ever.
[35:49.590 --> 35:51.510]  It stuck with me for 30 years.
[35:51.830 --> 35:52.170]  Damn.
[35:52.630 --> 35:56.410]  That's an interesting peeve because I really love it when you see it happen to other people.
[35:56.590 --> 36:00.810]  Like on the Sloppy Joe stream, the bad handshake was like the highlight of the whole stream for me.
[36:00.830 --> 36:04.310]  Oh, a bad handshake to witness is so great.
[36:04.630 --> 36:05.010]  Ridiculous.
[36:05.670 --> 36:07.490]  Well, those are all my peeves.
[36:07.570 --> 36:10.370]  But we go to Andrew to round it out with his final peeve.
[36:10.390 --> 36:11.610]  Oh, my last peeve.
[36:11.670 --> 36:14.970]  And this one is maybe the worst of all of them for me.
[36:15.190 --> 36:19.290]  Nothing gets me more stressed, more annoyed, more just upset.
[36:19.430 --> 36:22.130]  People not respecting their feet.
[36:22.470 --> 36:27.910]  My last pick is wearing shoes that can seal your feet in the summertime.
[36:28.210 --> 36:29.490]  That's sandal time, baby.
[36:29.490 --> 36:30.730]  Get their dogs out.
[36:30.770 --> 36:31.590]  Let's see their feet.
[36:31.710 --> 36:33.190]  Let's get them feet out there.
[36:33.710 --> 36:35.710]  I don't want to see you in runners in the summertime.
[36:36.290 --> 36:36.970]  It's hot.
[36:37.370 --> 36:38.950]  You gotta respect the feet.
[36:39.170 --> 36:40.070]  Let them breathe.
[36:40.410 --> 36:41.990]  Let them just be out and about.
[36:43.870 --> 36:46.170]  People not respecting their feet.
[36:46.830 --> 36:47.570]  The hell?
[36:47.810 --> 36:48.890]  I want to see them out and about.
[36:49.310 --> 36:50.310]  This is a great peeve, man.
[36:50.530 --> 36:51.390]  This is a good one.
[36:51.750 --> 36:52.950]  I'll just be walking down the street.
[36:53.010 --> 36:55.130]  I'll just see shoes left and right in the summertime.
[36:55.530 --> 36:56.290]  Yeah, in the summertime.
[36:56.910 --> 36:57.030]  Get real.
[36:57.190 --> 36:58.290]  Oh, come on.
[36:58.430 --> 36:59.170]  I'm with you, man.
[36:59.170 --> 37:02.170]  When the weather is fine, you're wearing your runners?
[37:03.830 --> 37:04.970]  Out of here.
[37:05.410 --> 37:07.410]  Oh, man.
[37:10.330 --> 37:14.690]  Well, Nick, since yours just got taken, what's your final peeve?
[37:15.710 --> 37:17.510]  I'm thinking about pivoting it now.
[37:17.670 --> 37:18.190]  Let me see.
[37:18.450 --> 37:19.650]  Do I want to go with the original?
[37:21.490 --> 37:27.610]  Well, you guys know from a previous draft that I enjoy mowing my lawn.
[37:27.610 --> 37:28.230]  Mmm.
[37:28.750 --> 37:32.410]  I like mowing my lawn because it's that getaway time.
[37:32.530 --> 37:33.910]  It's the time where I can think about stuff.
[37:34.110 --> 37:37.830]  But there's one thing about mowing lawns that I don't care for.
[37:38.110 --> 37:43.370]  And that is when somebody, your neighbor, someone down the street, whatever,
[37:43.550 --> 37:45.670]  someone in the neighborhood, is mowing over weeds.
[37:46.370 --> 37:48.890]  Don't be mowing over weeds, Greg.
[37:49.430 --> 37:51.470]  Stop mowing over your weeds, Greg.
[37:51.470 --> 37:56.090]  And getting your, you know, you're spreading the seed of the weed everywhere
[37:56.090 --> 37:58.490]  when you run over the weed with the mower.
[37:58.930 --> 38:00.570]  And it's causing more weeds.
[38:00.670 --> 38:01.670]  That's why you have them.
[38:01.790 --> 38:02.770]  That's why I have them.
[38:03.210 --> 38:05.250]  Pull the weeds before you mow them.
[38:08.890 --> 38:11.030]  Sorry, I might have narrow cast there.
[38:11.290 --> 38:16.190]  I genuinely hope Greg is a real person named Greg.
[38:18.510 --> 38:21.770]  Just imagine Nick Furious looking out the window at Greg.
[38:22.050 --> 38:24.390]  Just mowing over the weeds.
[38:24.590 --> 38:26.310]  As he's chopping up his weeds.
[38:26.890 --> 38:29.570]  Thinks he's doing a nice thing for the fucking whole neighborhood
[38:29.570 --> 38:30.830]  by beautifying his front yard.
[38:31.830 --> 38:33.990]  He doesn't happen to work in finance, does he, Nick?
[38:36.870 --> 38:37.670]  Oh, man.
[38:38.290 --> 38:40.990]  Great, great one to end yours on, Nick.
[38:41.010 --> 38:43.110]  But we go to Gavin, who started it.
[38:43.190 --> 38:44.170]  He's going to close us out.
[38:44.230 --> 38:45.530]  His final peeve.
[38:45.530 --> 38:48.110]  Is this your turbo peeve or is this just a peeve?
[38:48.410 --> 38:49.350]  It's my turbo peeve.
[38:49.590 --> 38:50.770]  Turbo peeve.
[38:50.910 --> 38:52.450]  Oh, the turbo peeve.
[38:52.550 --> 38:53.670]  Turbo peeve.
[38:54.030 --> 38:58.750]  I think later in life, if I could do it, I'm going to spend some serious money.
[38:58.830 --> 38:59.270]  The remainder.
[38:59.410 --> 39:02.970]  I'm going to put it in my will to put money towards abolishing the leaf blower.
[39:03.470 --> 39:04.310]  I hate it so much.
[39:06.030 --> 39:06.850]  Shut up.
[39:07.130 --> 39:08.350]  Shut up, you idiot.
[39:08.710 --> 39:09.450]  Shut up.
[39:09.750 --> 39:10.470]  Shut up.
[39:10.590 --> 39:11.490]  It's so funny.
[39:12.230 --> 39:15.550]  Tuesday, idiots coming around blowing leaves across the road.
[39:15.670 --> 39:16.870]  Oh, now it's Wednesday.
[39:16.990 --> 39:18.150]  Let's blow them all back.
[39:18.370 --> 39:19.390]  Now they're in the street.
[39:19.530 --> 39:20.870]  Blow it all over people's cars.
[39:21.210 --> 39:22.010]  Shut up.
[39:22.250 --> 39:22.910]  Shut up.
[39:23.250 --> 39:24.610]  It's called a broom, idiot.
[39:24.790 --> 39:25.470]  Use a broom.
[39:25.810 --> 39:26.690]  Oh, man.
[39:27.130 --> 39:28.010]  I agree with Gavin.
[39:28.250 --> 39:28.910]  Good call, Gavin.
[39:29.030 --> 39:29.470]  I hate.
[39:29.710 --> 39:31.090]  I just seriously.
[39:31.990 --> 39:33.550]  Do you make a leaf blower?
[39:33.730 --> 39:34.410]  I can tell.
[39:34.970 --> 39:39.710]  Did you just recommend people out in their yard with brooms sweeping up leaves, Nick?
[39:39.710 --> 39:43.150]  No, on the street or the driveway or the sidewalk.
[39:43.270 --> 39:44.630]  They can use rakes in the yard.
[39:44.630 --> 39:45.550]  Use a rake, maybe.
[39:46.010 --> 39:46.830]  In the yard.
[39:47.310 --> 39:47.810]  Oh, yeah.
[39:47.810 --> 39:48.870]  Use the rake on the driveway.
[39:49.530 --> 39:50.650]  My outdoor broom.
[39:51.970 --> 39:53.070]  There are outdoor brooms.
[39:53.110 --> 39:53.710]  What are you talking about?
[39:53.790 --> 39:54.290]  That's true, though.
[39:57.410 --> 40:01.950]  I'm typically using my driveway rake when I'm done mowing my weeds.
[40:02.450 --> 40:02.610]  Yeah.
[40:02.730 --> 40:05.010]  I got to clean all those up so I don't go in Nick's yard.
[40:05.230 --> 40:05.510]  Me and Greg.
[40:05.590 --> 40:08.110]  Well, you got to aerate them so they can, you know, plant better.
[40:08.250 --> 40:08.870]  We've done it.
[40:08.870 --> 40:10.750]  It's the Peeves draft.
[40:10.990 --> 40:11.810]  Let's run them down.
[40:11.890 --> 40:16.890]  You guys can let us know in the comments who had the peeves that you agree with the most.
[40:16.970 --> 40:21.490]  Gavin had full email and password sign in with two-factor authentication using a TV remote.
[40:21.690 --> 40:25.910]  People who have never edited insisting on something for editing purposes.
[40:26.710 --> 40:30.650]  Being asked about cookies on websites and the leaf blower.
[40:31.450 --> 40:35.790]  Nick has supreme pizzas at parties, slow left lane drivers,
[40:35.790 --> 40:39.090]  not picking up dog poop, and people who mow over weeds.
[40:39.890 --> 40:40.410]  Andrew!
[40:42.510 --> 40:45.210]  Expected tail seek in a video less than 10 minutes.
[40:45.630 --> 40:46.670]  The word collab.
[40:47.290 --> 40:48.370]  Don't at me.
[40:48.850 --> 40:50.890]  People not respecting their feet.
[40:54.390 --> 41:00.590]  I have unexpected updates, being late, TikTok continuing to show me videos that I say not
[41:00.590 --> 41:02.430]  interested to, and bad handshakes.
[41:02.950 --> 41:09.490]  And Jeff has hotel virtual check-in not working, the oblivious public, single soda
[41:09.490 --> 41:15.030]  sippers and forgetters, and come to me last orderers.
[41:15.410 --> 41:17.370]  That is our peeves.
[41:17.630 --> 41:18.950]  These are great peeves.
[41:19.350 --> 41:20.870]  I agree with Jeff.
[41:21.070 --> 41:24.770]  I have, I was writing down additional peeves as we were doing this too.
[41:25.210 --> 41:28.430]  So I definitely think that we should do another one of these.
[41:28.430 --> 41:32.570]  But before we do, you guys should let us know in the comments what your peeves are.
[41:32.670 --> 41:36.090]  What did we leave off this list in our first ever peeves draft?
[41:36.210 --> 41:38.130]  What's the peeve that gets you?
[41:38.450 --> 41:39.710]  Does it also have to do with feet?
[41:39.850 --> 41:41.130]  Let us know in the comments.
[41:41.310 --> 41:43.090]  Let people know about this draft.
[41:43.230 --> 41:45.370]  Let people know about the podcast and the gameplay videos.
[41:45.750 --> 41:49.310]  And you can get more of this at patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[41:49.750 --> 41:51.310]  Fellas, good peeves draft.
[41:51.490 --> 41:53.430]  Man, who knew Andrew liked feet so much?
[41:54.790 --> 41:56.350]  Listen, you need to let them breathe.
[41:57.730 --> 42:02.790]  I think this is the one where I'm most excited to hear the peeves or to hear the draft picks of the audience.
[42:03.110 --> 42:03.610]  Oh, I agree.
[42:03.850 --> 42:05.710]  So many where I'm like, oh, it's so good.
[42:05.790 --> 42:07.030]  I can't believe I didn't draft it.
[42:07.250 --> 42:09.050]  I think they're going to be a lot like that.
[42:09.150 --> 42:11.390]  But we'll have to wait and see what those are.
[42:11.490 --> 42:14.790]  And then you can see what our next picks are in our next peeves drafts.
[42:14.790 --> 42:16.190]  Until then, we'll see you next time.
[42:16.370 --> 42:16.730]  Bye.
[42:19.890 --> 42:23.070]  Now, is it going to offend anyone to tailsync?
[42:23.430 --> 42:26.030]  Yeah, is there enough time in this video that we need to tailsync, Gavin?
[42:26.430 --> 42:27.670]  Hell yeah, we absolutely should, yeah.
