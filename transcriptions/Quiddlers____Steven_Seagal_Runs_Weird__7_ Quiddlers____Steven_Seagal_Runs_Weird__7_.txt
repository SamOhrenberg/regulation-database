[00:11.400 --> 00:15.660]  including their Wi-Fi softener, under-sink filtration system, and more.

[00:19.780 --> 00:22.320]  better tasting, better quality water is within reach.

[00:26.880 --> 00:29.540]  Lowe's. We help you save.
[00:30.060 --> 00:33.060]  I have a question that I brought up in the last episode.
[00:34.840 --> 00:38.900]  Why isn't there terminology in movies like there is in video games?
[00:39.960 --> 00:40.860]  In what way?
[00:41.280 --> 00:45.660]  Is every movie first-person? Is it a first-person film?
[00:46.240 --> 00:48.160]  Oh, you're saying like that's...
[00:48.160 --> 00:51.920]  Also, you realize that that's not just games, right? That's like books?
[00:55.260 --> 00:59.040]  You realize that that's not just video games, that's like literature, right?
[00:59.480 --> 01:04.240]  Yeah, first-person, yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm just not as much of a book guy, so I don't think about that.
[01:04.340 --> 01:06.520]  Clearly, yeah. No, 100%.
[01:06.520 --> 01:11.660]  So, I think there's only... I think Hardcore Henry is maybe like the only first-person movie.
[01:12.960 --> 01:15.920]  Doom famously had some first-person shots in it.
[01:15.920 --> 01:21.280]  There are scenes with first-person in it, but technically, like what perspective are films?
[01:21.280 --> 01:22.180]  Third?
[01:22.620 --> 01:23.120]  Third?
[01:23.400 --> 01:24.340]  Third? Okay.
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.560]  So, a ground... yeah, okay.
[01:29.420 --> 01:29.920]  Interesting.
[01:30.200 --> 01:30.360]  Alright.
[01:31.000 --> 01:31.360]  Is it?
[01:31.360 --> 01:37.000]  It is. Yeah, well, I just... I never thought about the camera being attached to the person, I guess. I don't know.
[01:37.460 --> 01:40.340]  I was thinking about the perspective of the camera to the world.
[01:42.040 --> 01:42.540]  Okay.
[01:43.020 --> 01:44.720]  What about like Blair Witch?
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.040]  Blair Witch? Well, that is first-person, right?
[01:48.500 --> 01:49.040]  It has to be.
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.120]  Right. I would think so.
[01:51.800 --> 01:52.140]  Somewhat.
[01:53.580 --> 01:55.620]  Can you think of a single top-down movie?
[01:56.400 --> 01:57.900]  Anyone made a full top-down?
[01:58.980 --> 02:01.420]  I don't know. Let me know if you think of a top-down book.
[02:06.120 --> 02:08.260]  Man, when are we gonna get Gavin? Is he already a minute late?
[02:08.760 --> 02:09.160]  No, I'm here.
[02:09.920 --> 02:11.420]  Whoa, he just didn't say anything!
[02:11.700 --> 02:12.160]  Yeah, he didn't.
[02:12.160 --> 02:12.540]  I was here at three.
[02:14.240 --> 02:15.240]  Just without saying anything.
[02:15.860 --> 02:17.060]  Here we go. Alright, I'm gonna start it off.
[02:17.560 --> 02:21.560]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[02:21.860 --> 02:23.760]  I believe this is episode number seven.
[02:24.080 --> 02:26.680]  I don't see anybody enter it into the Discord. There we go.
[02:27.800 --> 02:33.180]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour.
[02:33.780 --> 02:35.360]  Name a top-down film, Gavin.
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.180]  Planet Earth.
[02:38.340 --> 02:39.000]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39.100 --> 02:39.680]  Planet Earth.
[02:40.060 --> 02:40.520]  Some ants.
[02:40.520 --> 02:40.920]  There you go.
[02:41.900 --> 02:43.360]  Is there a full one, though?
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.800]  There's sequences, like John Wick 4 I just watched. That has a long, top-down sequence.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.540]  Which felt like a video game.
[02:52.140 --> 02:52.600]  Contra.
[02:54.060 --> 02:59.380]  That would be fucking awesome if they made a Contra movie and it was just top-down the entire time.
[02:59.580 --> 03:02.720]  That would be real cool. I can get behind that.
[03:03.380 --> 03:05.940]  Speaking of Contra, did you guys ever play Ikari Warriors?
[03:07.280 --> 03:07.660]  No.
[03:08.000 --> 03:08.600]  It sounds familiar.
[03:09.040 --> 03:14.460]  Yeah, with Ralph and Clark, who were folded into the King of Fighters, an SNK franchise. Thank you.
[03:14.540 --> 03:14.900]  Oh, really?
[03:15.320 --> 03:22.420]  Well, I was going to ask, if you played Ikari Warriors, did you ever play the Rambo top-down Sega Master System game?
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.700]  Yeah, I remember that.
[03:23.960 --> 03:25.340]  That game was fucking awesome.
[03:25.900 --> 03:28.360]  That game is so slept on. I don't know why.
[03:29.160 --> 03:30.020]  It was such a great game.
[03:30.760 --> 03:35.480]  Is Ikari Warriors the one where you're dressed in pink and you get hit and you dance back a little bit?
[03:37.860 --> 03:38.940]  I don't remember that.
[03:39.800 --> 03:40.720]  Dressed in pink?
[03:41.080 --> 03:43.440]  That's pink and purple and shit. Rambo.
[03:44.740 --> 03:45.780]  Oh, that looks awesome.
[03:46.420 --> 03:46.820]  It was awesome.
[03:46.840 --> 03:51.720]  Ikari Warriors is a similar sort of this. Is that what you're thinking of, Gavin? Is that pink and purple to you?
[03:52.600 --> 03:52.840]  Yeah.
[03:55.400 --> 03:56.480]  I see the pink and purple.
[03:57.000 --> 03:57.820]  Yeah, well, that's it.
[03:58.060 --> 03:58.640]  Alright, great job.
[03:58.640 --> 04:08.160]  Is Rambo the most films to like worst film ratio? Because I'd argue there's like two good Rambo movies, but there's six of them.
[04:08.720 --> 04:09.220]  Terminator?
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.400]  There's two really good Terminators, though.
[04:14.120 --> 04:16.300]  Yeah, and then how many Terminator movies are there?
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.440]  Is the last one good? I didn't see the last one. I felt like some people liked the last Terminator movie.
[04:22.840 --> 04:27.860]  No, and let me tell you this. It's the only Terminator movie Tobin's seen.
[04:27.860 --> 04:28.480]  What?
[04:29.100 --> 04:29.780]  Oh, really?
[04:30.180 --> 04:35.060]  Went with him to the theater to watch like Terminator 7 or whatever the fuck it was.
[04:35.460 --> 04:39.240]  And he's like, I've never seen these before.
[04:40.180 --> 04:41.160]  That's so funny.
[04:41.780 --> 04:43.280]  Yeah, didn't they have Linda Hamilton?
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.040]  Yes.
[04:45.160 --> 04:45.640]  Did a comeback.
[04:45.960 --> 04:46.420]  Yeah.
[04:47.280 --> 04:49.340]  I thought people liked that. That's a bad one.
[04:49.520 --> 04:50.060]  That's disappointing.
[04:50.340 --> 04:51.420]  It sucked, yeah. Yeah, it sucked.
[04:53.480 --> 04:56.820]  Man, I was excited to watch it. Genesis was so bad.
[04:56.820 --> 04:57.440]  Oh, yeah.
[04:57.560 --> 04:57.960]  Genesis.
[04:59.100 --> 04:59.580]  Genesis.
[05:00.700 --> 05:04.680]  Which one was Genesis? Was that the one with...
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.180]  Emilia Clarke.
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.020]  Emilia Clarke in it?
[05:07.300 --> 05:08.600]  Yeah, Emilia Clarke in it.
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.380]  They recreate it. It feels like fan fiction. It's a very weird movie.
[05:13.500 --> 05:16.560]  Yeah, it's really bad. Terminator Salvation is fucking terrible, too.
[05:16.740 --> 05:18.680]  Yeah, I forget that that one exists.
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.220]  Which one's Terminator 3?
[05:20.440 --> 05:21.540]  Good for you.
[05:21.980 --> 05:22.840]  That's the one.
[05:24.820 --> 05:28.580]  Terminator 3 is the one that came out in the early 2000s.
[05:28.660 --> 05:29.040]  With Claire Danes?
[05:29.040 --> 05:30.220]  It's the casket gun one.
[05:30.640 --> 05:31.840]  Oh, yeah. Claire Danes, yeah.
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.700]  Right? Claire Danes is in that one? That was okay.
[05:35.140 --> 05:39.280]  Where his battery's about to pop and then they throw it out of the car and it's like a nuke going off.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.860]  Yeah. Fucking terrible. God, the movie sucked.
[05:41.860 --> 05:42.560]  Where the whole thing...
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.120]  The movie sucked.
[05:43.480 --> 05:51.520]  Terminator 3 was okay because it ended well. It ended like they got tricked into going into safety for the nuclear...
[05:51.520 --> 05:53.660]  But they weren't. They never were.
[05:53.660 --> 05:55.160]  Yeah, they turned off the cameras.
[05:55.180 --> 05:55.640]  They were just being protected.
[05:56.140 --> 05:56.360]  Yeah.
[05:56.500 --> 05:58.780]  Yeah, and they were done with the movie. That was my favorite part.
[06:04.990 --> 06:06.830]  It's tough to have a good franchise.
[06:08.030 --> 06:12.750]  I feel like Vin Diesel's trying to do like seven franchises and one of them has worked.
[06:13.270 --> 06:15.210]  But he feels like a real franchise guy to me.
[06:15.950 --> 06:18.950]  Fast and Furious, but Riddick didn't really work out.
[06:20.010 --> 06:23.790]  He wanted The Last Witch Hunter to be a big franchise. That didn't work out.
[06:24.990 --> 06:27.050]  I mean, God is the galaxy, I would say worked out.
[06:27.490 --> 06:30.050]  I don't think he gets any credit for that.
[06:30.630 --> 06:34.950]  No, he stood on stilts to record his lines. He's definitely fully involved.
[06:36.090 --> 06:36.970]  Did he really?
[06:37.690 --> 06:38.070]  Yeah.
[06:40.750 --> 06:41.830]  I love Vin Diesel.
[06:41.830 --> 06:44.670]  You could hear the stilts in his performance.
[06:44.670 --> 06:49.130]  Yeah, he had to get into the perspective of a tree, even though he's a little, he's a tiny tree.
[06:50.870 --> 06:56.810]  Ah, Eric posted a photo of him doing the I am Groot thing.
[06:57.550 --> 07:02.930]  Do you think after Groot was small, he like shoes on his knees like Dorf recorded his lines?
[07:03.270 --> 07:06.930]  He started crawling around on the floor like Rady Boy.
[07:08.030 --> 07:19.770]  If they were ever to resurrect, like reboot the Dorf franchise for 2024, I'm throwing Vin Diesel in as my pick.
[07:19.890 --> 07:23.590]  I want him to be the new Tim Conway in that franchise.
[07:24.910 --> 07:27.990]  Oh, I would love it.
[07:28.290 --> 07:29.650]  I've never seen a Dorf.
[07:30.330 --> 07:31.150]  You're not missing out.
[07:31.650 --> 07:33.410]  Maybe we'll blindside you with one someday.
[07:33.410 --> 07:37.130]  I'd love it because I've heard about it a lot, but never.
[07:37.990 --> 07:41.910]  Dorf on Golf as a small child, I thought was absolutely hilarious.
[07:42.610 --> 07:54.210]  It's one of those things that was definitely family friendly, early 80s comedy that if we watch now might not be family friendly at all in 2024.
[07:54.550 --> 07:56.930]  I don't know. It'd be really interesting to see, you know.
[07:57.330 --> 07:59.310]  I'd be really nervous about it for sure.
[07:59.310 --> 08:01.370]  What was the other little blokes called?
[08:01.570 --> 08:03.390]  Like Quiddlers or something?
[08:03.530 --> 08:04.230]  Was it Quiddlers?
[08:04.770 --> 08:05.370]  What?
[08:05.870 --> 08:07.890]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[08:08.270 --> 08:08.850]  Quiddlers?
[08:09.370 --> 08:09.810]  Quiddlers.
[08:10.110 --> 08:11.390]  Quiddlers is the first...
[08:12.430 --> 08:14.770]  I think that's just a slur.
[08:15.230 --> 08:16.090]  Oh my god!
[08:16.290 --> 08:18.150]  The first part of the title. Quiddlers?
[08:18.650 --> 08:20.170]  Oh, they have a website.
[08:20.930 --> 08:25.130]  I remember seeing the Quiddlers on TV when I was like eight maybe.
[08:25.910 --> 08:27.310]  Oh, that's not...
[08:27.910 --> 08:29.110]  What are the Quiddlers?
[08:29.350 --> 08:30.930]  That looks pretty offensive actually.
[08:31.270 --> 08:31.870]  Oh, wow.
[08:32.150 --> 08:34.250]  It's like the village people but small?
[08:34.690 --> 08:37.070]  But I don't think... I think they are on their knees though.
[08:39.090 --> 08:43.610]  Oh, here they are. Here they are as the Blues Brothers.
[08:50.770 --> 08:54.390]  So that's your jam, huh, Gavin? You're a Quiddler guy?
[08:54.390 --> 08:55.630]  Apparently I was.
[08:57.510 --> 08:59.970]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, because it was Michael Jackson.
[09:00.110 --> 09:01.230]  I remember seeing Michael Jackson.
[09:02.870 --> 09:03.730]  Quiddling around.
[09:04.450 --> 09:06.870]  So they just do like... they just do songs then.
[09:07.010 --> 09:08.110]  They're a musical act.
[09:09.310 --> 09:13.130]  I honestly haven't seen or thought about it in 30 years.
[09:13.230 --> 09:14.490]  So I don't really... I don't entirely remember.
[09:14.610 --> 09:16.090]  I was legitimately a child.
[09:16.670 --> 09:16.870]  Okay.
[09:17.710 --> 09:18.790]  They do have a website.
[09:19.670 --> 09:23.670]  It's a physical comedy group based in Las Vegas.
[09:23.670 --> 09:25.050]  When did they disband?
[09:26.550 --> 09:27.730]  I can't get it to load.
[09:27.810 --> 09:28.970]  Hold on. Here we go.
[09:29.210 --> 09:30.670]  We got a... they got a Wikipedia.
[09:33.210 --> 09:37.870]  Currently, the latest incarnation of the Quiddlers under Ebagers Creative Direction
[09:38.490 --> 09:40.250]  is a cabaret show in Vegas.
[09:41.070 --> 09:42.090]  Are they still going?
[09:42.230 --> 09:43.430]  Yes, they're still...
[09:43.430 --> 09:45.130]  I wonder if they're still doing Smooth Criminal.
[09:45.790 --> 09:47.750]  They're on America's Got Talent Wiki.
[09:48.070 --> 09:50.970]  And it says that they're a puppeteer group from season three
[09:50.970 --> 09:53.430]  that got eliminated in the audition round.
[09:53.670 --> 09:58.510]  And then they returned for season 12 in which they got cut at the judge cuts.
[09:58.670 --> 10:00.670]  So I guess they never really did well.
[10:01.210 --> 10:05.890]  They have made multiple appearances at NBA halftimes
[10:05.890 --> 10:08.370]  for the Charlotte Hornets, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers,
[10:08.530 --> 10:09.990]  Pistons, Rockets, Pacers, Heat.
[10:10.230 --> 10:11.190]  Like everybody.
[10:12.110 --> 10:14.010]  The CBA as well.
[10:15.110 --> 10:16.030]  Good lord.
[10:16.870 --> 10:20.630]  Oh, they've appeared at the... they appeared at the 1989 Chicago Auto Show.
[10:22.630 --> 10:23.890]  They've been gone a long time.
[10:24.390 --> 10:26.870]  Dude, they hit the auto circuit really hard in 1989.
[10:27.390 --> 10:29.790]  North American International Auto Show, Detroit, 1989.
[10:29.950 --> 10:31.250]  Chicago Auto Show, 1989.
[10:31.470 --> 10:33.250]  Cleveland International Auto Show, 1989.
[10:33.490 --> 10:34.610]  New York Auto Show, 1989.
[10:34.770 --> 10:35.730]  Baltimore, 1990.
[10:36.130 --> 10:37.290]  Dallas Auto Show, 1990.
[10:37.630 --> 10:38.410]  Nothing since.
[10:39.250 --> 10:42.450]  They hit those auto shows hard for a year and a half and then walked away.
[10:43.070 --> 10:47.670]  Nothing brings out decade repressed memories like this podcast.
[10:49.470 --> 10:52.670]  Knowing the quiddlers just in your soul is insane.
[10:53.450 --> 10:54.830]  That's like the truest thing you've ever said.
[10:56.110 --> 10:56.510]  Unbelievable.
[10:58.030 --> 10:59.890]  That nothing brings out repressed memories like this podcast.
[11:00.310 --> 11:00.610]  Oh, okay.
[11:01.810 --> 11:02.730]  Yeah, I'm just agreeing with you.
[11:03.070 --> 11:03.450]  Thanks.
[11:04.030 --> 11:04.710]  You don't have to be on your...
[11:05.230 --> 11:06.950]  I have a game today.
[11:07.830 --> 11:08.230]  Oh!
[11:08.510 --> 11:09.970]  I don't know if we want to hop into a game.
[11:10.450 --> 11:10.830]  Let's do it.
[11:10.830 --> 11:11.870]  I would love to hop into a game.
[11:12.470 --> 11:15.930]  It was a long time ago on our previous podcast.
[11:15.930 --> 11:17.630]  It was called F*** Face.
[11:18.050 --> 11:27.250]  And we were talking about people's teeth and would be able to recognize the person by their teeth on the Ian F*** Face logo.
[11:28.050 --> 11:28.550]  Oh, Jesus.
[11:28.870 --> 11:29.510]  Oh, God.
[11:30.730 --> 11:32.030]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[11:32.470 --> 11:33.630]  Alright, round one.
[11:33.750 --> 11:35.490]  Okay, let's see some teeth.
[11:36.270 --> 11:37.170]  Oh, no!
[11:38.310 --> 11:40.350]  I hate this game already.
[11:40.650 --> 11:41.030]  Why?
[11:42.410 --> 11:44.490]  It's just very unpleasant.
[11:44.490 --> 11:46.890]  Now, is that going to be one of the five of us?
[11:47.510 --> 11:47.710]  Yeah.
[11:48.610 --> 11:48.970]  Oh.
[11:49.230 --> 11:49.870]  Oh, okay.
[11:49.950 --> 11:52.130]  Sorry, audience, this is a very visual bit.
[11:52.130 --> 11:52.790]  Yeah, it is.
[11:53.170 --> 11:55.710]  On YouTube, this might be better to watch there or look at the Instagram.
[11:56.110 --> 12:00.910]  Yeah, I'll definitely make sure to post all these images on the Instagram so you suffer along with us.
[12:02.150 --> 12:08.570]  It's like that Conan O'Brien skit where they would just put a picture of Bill Clinton up and then have the mouth, you know, have somebody's mouth behind it.
[12:09.350 --> 12:10.450]  It's really disturbing.
[12:10.690 --> 12:11.650]  How do we give you the answers?
[12:12.710 --> 12:13.890]  Just say who you think it is.
[12:14.490 --> 12:15.130]  Oh, okay.
[12:15.310 --> 12:16.270]  I think that's Eric.
[12:16.530 --> 12:17.270]  Yeah, I think it's Eric.
[12:17.970 --> 12:19.370]  Really? My teeth look that white?
[12:20.410 --> 12:21.210]  I think...
[12:21.210 --> 12:21.590]  Yeah.
[12:22.610 --> 12:22.870]  Maybe.
[12:23.150 --> 12:25.350]  Well, it's definitely not me, because they're all real teeth.
[12:25.490 --> 12:25.890]  It's not me.
[12:28.390 --> 12:31.770]  I guess it's thinking Gracie, maybe, from the Krutoff?
[12:33.150 --> 12:33.950]  Oh, it...
[12:33.950 --> 12:35.530]  We just said it's one of the five of us, didn't we?
[12:35.930 --> 12:36.190]  Yeah.
[12:36.950 --> 12:37.390]  Oh, okay.
[12:37.610 --> 12:38.910]  Okay, so your guess is Gracie.
[12:41.410 --> 12:45.050]  Gracie's angle up her teeth, though, would be the best perspective for this picture.
[12:46.050 --> 12:49.630]  People making that into the Jaws poster was really fucking great.
[12:49.850 --> 12:50.850]  It was so good.
[12:51.330 --> 12:53.230]  I want to get into the Krutoff after this.
[12:54.790 --> 12:55.170]  Is...
[12:55.170 --> 12:56.650]  I guess it is...
[12:56.650 --> 12:57.110]  Yeah.
[12:57.490 --> 12:58.630]  I guess it's me?
[12:58.870 --> 13:00.770]  I don't think my teeth are that straight.
[13:01.950 --> 13:02.950]  Yeah, that's right.
[13:03.130 --> 13:03.510]  That's Eric.
[13:04.170 --> 13:04.830]  Is it really?
[13:05.010 --> 13:05.070]  Yeah!
[13:05.310 --> 13:07.690]  I got some nice toppers there, bud.
[13:07.710 --> 13:08.750]  You're not doing too bad, dude.
[13:08.750 --> 13:09.550]  Great job.
[13:09.630 --> 13:10.110]  You know what?
[13:11.030 --> 13:11.770]  It is me.
[13:11.870 --> 13:13.590]  Do you know how long...
[13:13.590 --> 13:15.670]  Like, what's the original photo that the teeth are from?
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.090]  Do you know?
[13:20.750 --> 13:21.750]  Like, that was...
[13:21.750 --> 13:22.490]  Is that a no?
[13:22.670 --> 13:22.970]  I suppose.
[13:23.290 --> 13:23.570]  Yeah.
[13:24.270 --> 13:25.530]  You can just say no.
[13:26.030 --> 13:30.290]  Yeah, it's you doing your, I'm small, little curled up against the mic thing.
[13:30.930 --> 13:31.770]  Oh, wow.
[13:33.630 --> 13:34.050]  Okay.
[13:34.050 --> 13:43.250]  Because if you look all the way on the back, I guess right-hand side where, like, underneath where the C would be and fuck, there's a black gap there.
[13:43.310 --> 13:45.870]  It's because I'm missing a tooth all the way in the back.
[13:46.130 --> 13:47.230]  I had to get it extracted.
[13:47.450 --> 13:48.690]  So I guess that is me.
[13:48.830 --> 13:49.670]  That makes sense.
[13:50.130 --> 13:51.610]  Actually, it's just you smiling on a couch.
[13:52.170 --> 13:53.190]  I had to change that one.
[13:54.370 --> 13:54.770]  What?
[13:55.110 --> 13:55.510]  Wait.
[13:56.090 --> 13:56.970]  It's not that you're small.
[13:57.090 --> 13:57.810]  What about this one?
[13:59.630 --> 14:00.970]  Oh, that's clearly...
[14:00.970 --> 14:02.030]  I know, that's easy.
[14:02.850 --> 14:03.250]  That's...
[14:03.250 --> 14:03.990]  Yeah, that's...
[14:03.990 --> 14:06.630]  Those are the lips of Andrew Panton.
[14:06.910 --> 14:07.850]  I would recognize them anywhere.
[14:07.990 --> 14:09.250]  Old, old toothless fucker.
[14:10.270 --> 14:10.570]  Me.
[14:11.970 --> 14:13.870]  Still never seen your teeth, I'm convinced of it.
[14:14.810 --> 14:15.670]  What about this one?
[14:17.850 --> 14:18.250]  That's...
[14:18.250 --> 14:18.950]  That's Nick.
[14:19.570 --> 14:20.070]  That's Nick.
[14:20.070 --> 14:21.050]  It has to be Nick.
[14:21.450 --> 14:25.710]  Nick's looks, like, freakishly natural in a way that is very odd.
[14:26.550 --> 14:28.350]  That looks like it should be there.
[14:29.190 --> 14:30.810]  It's also old-timey and black and white.
[14:30.850 --> 14:32.630]  The black and white makes it look like I'm gonna eat you.
[14:33.890 --> 14:34.370]  Oh.
[14:36.090 --> 14:40.610]  I think if we had to pick so far, I would say Nick's are the regulation ENT.
[14:41.190 --> 14:42.650]  That is a nightmare.
[14:42.970 --> 14:43.970]  100% Gavin.
[14:44.310 --> 14:45.050]  Yeah, definitely.
[14:45.050 --> 14:45.830]  And that would be me.
[14:46.850 --> 14:47.070]  Yeah.
[14:47.570 --> 14:50.650]  That's from this picture of me and my granddad.
[14:56.450 --> 14:57.810]  Last but not least.
[14:59.210 --> 14:59.970]  Oh, yeah.
[15:00.130 --> 15:00.690]  Oh, boy.
[15:01.070 --> 15:01.630]  There you go.
[15:01.630 --> 15:02.870]  Now, here's the thing.
[15:03.030 --> 15:05.930]  I was with Andrew that Nick's look like the regulation teeth.
[15:06.030 --> 15:08.910]  I think the black and white really helps to, like, really set it in there.
[15:09.010 --> 15:15.470]  But something about Geoff's big mouth, his gob just smack in the middle of that thing really fits for Ian to me.
[15:15.530 --> 15:17.830]  You can feel the joy in the smile.
[15:18.830 --> 15:23.530]  Geoff's is hitting me with, like, annoying orange vibes is the way I feel about it.
[15:23.550 --> 15:24.690]  Oh, yeah.
[15:25.210 --> 15:27.390]  Geoff, you look like the annoying orange.
[15:28.150 --> 15:29.230]  Yeah, I'll take that.
[15:29.230 --> 15:33.770]  You know, while we're at it, I've always gotten Jenna Marbles vibes from Andrew.
[15:33.930 --> 15:35.210]  So, it's like, I can see that.
[15:37.710 --> 15:40.250]  And Eric's really mystery guitar man.
[15:40.990 --> 15:41.170]  Yeah.
[15:41.310 --> 15:42.210]  Oh, big time.
[15:42.490 --> 15:42.930]  Absolutely.
[15:44.370 --> 15:52.790]  The thing that made me laugh the most while I was doing this, aside from these stupid teeth pictures, is that I wanted to remove the original teeth from the sketch.
[15:53.270 --> 15:58.830]  So, I used Photoshop to... I just selected it and then did, like, a content-aware delete thing.
[15:59.230 --> 16:01.550]  Where it's supposed to just fill it with the surroundings.
[16:02.410 --> 16:04.410]  This is the abomination that it made.
[16:05.210 --> 16:06.230]  Oh, my God!
[16:07.350 --> 16:08.710]  What the fuck?
[16:09.270 --> 16:12.330]  It made a face! It made an Ian face! Look!
[16:12.730 --> 16:14.830]  It has nose and a mouth! Holy shit!
[16:15.070 --> 16:18.690]  I'm gonna go ahead and make the thumbnail right now for this episode. That's perfect.
[16:18.690 --> 16:23.170]  Now it's the guy with a lump on his head, like Tom and Jerry, looking really pissed.
[16:23.450 --> 16:24.210]  Oh, my God.
[16:24.370 --> 16:25.750]  Where did he get that from?
[16:26.190 --> 16:28.010]  That's A.I. shit right there, dude.
[16:28.010 --> 16:30.150]  That's why we shouldn't use A.I.
[16:31.170 --> 16:32.110]  That's terrifying.
[16:32.110 --> 16:33.690]  That's insane.
[16:34.770 --> 16:36.410]  I kinda wanna get a tattoo.
[16:39.850 --> 16:42.170]  Oh, a full back tattoo of just that?
[16:42.490 --> 16:47.490]  It looks like a creepy man who got hit on the head with a... like an anvil.
[16:47.970 --> 16:48.370]  Yes.
[16:49.790 --> 16:51.670]  And his lump has nostrils.
[16:52.170 --> 16:53.450]  Yeah, and he's got a nostril lump.
[16:53.450 --> 16:57.010]  And the eyes are almost like eggs. Like they...
[16:58.190 --> 17:00.750]  They do look like hard-boiled eggs.
[17:01.350 --> 17:05.690]  I was photoshopping, and when I did that, I legitimately went BAH!
[17:06.870 --> 17:07.390]  Yeah.
[17:08.310 --> 17:09.850]  It was so big on my screen.
[17:09.850 --> 17:10.670]  You made a demon.
[17:11.590 --> 17:12.410]  It created hell.
[17:12.630 --> 17:14.470]  It's the fucking funniest thing I've ever seen.
[17:16.010 --> 17:17.510]  That is the end of my game.
[17:17.970 --> 17:18.230]  Wow.
[17:18.250 --> 17:18.810]  That's a good game.
[17:19.910 --> 17:26.330]  You... I... When I was thinking about this game, I thought at first it was gonna be like trying to recognize celebrity teeth or like movie teeth.
[17:26.950 --> 17:28.950]  Doing this made me realize there's no way.
[17:29.330 --> 17:33.910]  Cause in a pool of us, it was still difficult. The first one, especially.
[17:34.570 --> 17:38.950]  Like it took essentially removing the pool to four to make it more obvious.
[17:39.690 --> 17:42.250]  I don't think I'd be able to recognize celebrity teeth based on this.
[17:42.870 --> 17:46.650]  Well, maybe we should... Well, also, how much do you look at celebrity teeth, though?
[17:46.650 --> 17:50.250]  Not often. Like, I just think it's a detail you don't register.
[17:50.550 --> 17:53.790]  I'm looking at y'all's teeth constantly. I think about them all the time.
[17:53.970 --> 18:02.270]  Also, celebrity teeth now are all the same. Everyone's veneers or whatever. Like, Furiosa...
[18:02.270 --> 18:04.070]  Everyone's picked number three out of the catalog.
[18:04.250 --> 18:10.750]  Yeah, Chris Hemsworth just put in like fake teeth and he went, whoa, I look crazy!
[18:11.130 --> 18:16.070]  For like the screen tests of Furiosa. And it's like, those are just normal teeth. You have normal human teeth.
[18:16.070 --> 18:16.930]  You fucking idiot.
[18:20.710 --> 18:23.370]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[18:23.750 --> 18:27.030]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[18:27.470 --> 18:32.690]  And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[18:32.890 --> 18:40.850]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app, it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[18:41.210 --> 18:43.110]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[18:46.130 --> 18:49.650]  A massage chair can look extravagant.
[18:50.010 --> 18:53.730]  Eight different configurations, adjustable intensity, and it's heated.
[18:54.570 --> 18:56.790]  And it feels so good.
[18:57.530 --> 19:01.870]  Yes, a massage chair can look extravagant. And two, well, even more.
[19:02.250 --> 19:07.870]  But when those massage chairs come with a car, they become quite practical.
[19:07.870 --> 19:15.790]  The new Volkswagen Teguan 2025, with premium features like the massage front seats, only looks extravagant.
[19:16.110 --> 19:22.930]  Hey, I also have a game. We can't play it today, but I want to pitch it to y'all as a potential future game and see what you think.
[19:23.190 --> 19:28.390]  I pitched it to Gavin already. He seemed to like it okay. So I wanted to see what y'all thought about it, if that's okay.
[19:28.550 --> 19:29.110]  What's the game?
[19:29.410 --> 19:31.290]  I call it Cemetery Bingo.
[19:31.890 --> 19:32.290]  Okay.
[19:33.030 --> 19:38.270]  We go to a cemetery, and then we play bingo with the headstones.
[19:38.570 --> 19:39.770]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[19:40.650 --> 19:44.830]  Somebody who has three first names, like James Earl Mike.
[19:45.610 --> 19:47.650]  Somebody who died on their birthday.
[19:48.150 --> 19:51.210]  Somebody who dies one day before or after their birthday.
[19:51.290 --> 19:52.610]  Somebody who was born on Christmas.
[19:53.010 --> 19:54.490]  Somebody who has the same name as you.
[19:54.630 --> 19:55.590]  A famous name.
[19:55.830 --> 19:57.010]  Two people with the same name.
[19:57.510 --> 20:00.850]  Maybe somebody whose name was a job, like their last name was Carpenter.
[20:00.850 --> 20:03.290]  The oldest tombstone you could find.
[20:03.450 --> 20:04.570]  Like the first one in.
[20:05.950 --> 20:07.350]  What else do we have? Longest liver.
[20:07.530 --> 20:08.630]  Somebody who lived the longest.
[20:08.750 --> 20:10.410]  Somebody with a nickname.
[20:10.570 --> 20:13.130]  Somebody with a quote on their tombstone.
[20:13.510 --> 20:15.010]  Somebody who was buried at sea.
[20:15.430 --> 20:17.670]  That's what we called it in the car on the way home last night. Longest liver.
[20:18.190 --> 20:20.510]  Someone buried at sea? Did they put a gravestone down for this?
[20:20.510 --> 20:22.630]  Yeah, apparently a lot of people will put gravestones out.
[20:22.730 --> 20:24.050]  Burndog was talking about it last night.
[20:24.110 --> 20:27.870]  It's his favorite thing to do when he goes to a cemetery is look for buried at sea headstones.
[20:29.270 --> 20:31.010]  Why is he going to a cemetery?
[20:32.350 --> 20:33.430]  Why does anybody go to a cemetery?
[20:34.350 --> 20:35.710]  Probably to look at dead stuff.
[20:36.350 --> 20:37.770]  I mean, you've seen his art.
[20:38.110 --> 20:40.130]  Like, you know what the fuck he does.
[20:40.270 --> 20:41.730]  Of course he goes to the cemetery.
[20:41.870 --> 20:42.710]  I haven't seen his art.
[20:43.250 --> 20:44.870]  You haven't seen his art?
[20:45.130 --> 20:46.370]  No, I just know he is an artist.
[20:46.510 --> 20:47.330]  I haven't seen his art.
[20:47.390 --> 20:48.250]  Oh, here.
[20:49.690 --> 20:50.090]  So...
[20:51.390 --> 20:51.790]  Fucking...
[20:51.790 --> 20:53.850]  His shit is wild.
[20:55.090 --> 20:57.130]  He paints this by hand.
[20:57.130 --> 20:58.250]  Oh, okay, nevermind.
[20:59.450 --> 21:00.270]  Totally get it.
[21:00.790 --> 21:01.010]  Nevermind.
[21:01.150 --> 21:02.650]  Yeah, that's what he does.
[21:02.930 --> 21:03.030]  That checks.
[21:04.450 --> 21:05.470]  That's kind of his deal.
[21:06.330 --> 21:06.690]  That makes sense.
[21:06.690 --> 21:08.030]  Oil paints, too. All oil.
[21:08.550 --> 21:11.310]  Because my next question is going to be like, why...
[21:11.310 --> 21:14.210]  How would you be in a position to want to gamify a cemetery?
[21:14.730 --> 21:16.030]  Like, how often...
[21:16.030 --> 21:16.730]  This all reads.
[21:16.910 --> 21:20.410]  I used to live by a cemetery at one point.
[21:20.510 --> 21:22.570]  And I would go there for walks or to ride my bike sometimes.
[21:22.670 --> 21:24.390]  Because it's just like a big open area of space.
[21:24.390 --> 21:25.390]  And it's just like...
[21:25.390 --> 21:27.590]  It's kind of like going to the park sometimes, you know?
[21:28.230 --> 21:32.490]  And I was just thinking about how much fun we had with Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[21:32.630 --> 21:35.950]  And making games out of stuff that's just kind of sitting there.
[21:36.690 --> 21:38.370]  And kind of trying to repurpose it.
[21:38.490 --> 21:43.870]  And I thought, cemeteries are wonderful places to go and have some quiet meditation or silence.
[21:44.150 --> 21:46.970]  Or go spend a little bit of time with a loved one that you miss.
[21:47.110 --> 21:49.050]  But they could also be something else.
[21:49.050 --> 21:54.490]  Like a place to have a fun little game that isn't insulting to the dead people at all.
[21:54.910 --> 21:59.010]  In much the same way that Sloppy Joe's Bingo is not insulting to the people that we're calling bingo on.
[21:59.570 --> 22:02.790]  We're not being derogatory towards them in any way.
[22:02.870 --> 22:06.030]  We're just, you know, finding interesting little things about their lives.
[22:06.070 --> 22:07.790]  Or what we can glean from the tombstone.
[22:07.990 --> 22:10.170]  And, you know, you try to find... I don't know.
[22:11.150 --> 22:11.550]  Little...
[22:11.550 --> 22:14.250]  Just little interesting nuggets to turn into bingo.
[22:14.250 --> 22:21.450]  I feel like you need to have somebody in the cemetery that you know to play.
[22:22.010 --> 22:25.470]  I feel like that would be my moral hurdle with it.
[22:25.730 --> 22:28.170]  I think I would need to have skin in the game.
[22:28.590 --> 22:32.170]  What if you only... here was a... because we were talking about this last night.
[22:32.430 --> 22:38.810]  Are you being unintentionally insulting in some way?
[22:39.150 --> 22:41.470]  Or disrespectful? Because I would certainly never want to do that.
[22:41.470 --> 22:44.870]  The solution we came up with in the car on the way home last night is...
[22:44.870 --> 22:49.130]  What if you could only play it with people who died before the oldest person playing was born?
[22:50.910 --> 22:53.830]  So like you... 1975 would be the cutoff for us.
[22:54.090 --> 22:56.170]  Anybody after 1975 couldn't be considered.
[22:56.670 --> 22:58.190]  Why? And why is that?
[22:59.130 --> 23:01.890]  Because they're so far dead, they never lived in our world.
[23:04.650 --> 23:08.470]  So it's not like we're being insulting to somebody who died last month.
[23:08.570 --> 23:10.710]  And you're gonna go, that was my aunt, you dickhead.
[23:10.710 --> 23:14.070]  You were talking about her name, it's like, no, that person's been dead for 50, 49 years.
[23:14.070 --> 23:18.730]  Yeah, but that could still be an old guy who comes to see his wife every week.
[23:18.830 --> 23:21.390]  That's the issue with the hurdle.
[23:21.510 --> 23:24.730]  We're not being insulting in the cemetery to anybody.
[23:24.810 --> 23:26.430]  We're just walking around and looking at tombstones.
[23:26.950 --> 23:30.390]  So to an outward looker, it would just be a bunch of us just going like, hmm.
[23:30.910 --> 23:31.930]  It wouldn't look disrespectful.
[23:31.930 --> 23:34.270]  It'd look like anybody at a cemetery ever.
[23:34.550 --> 23:37.370]  The problem is gamifying it.
[23:37.370 --> 23:41.870]  Yes, I agree. So here's what I think is where we would cross the line.
[23:41.990 --> 23:48.570]  Is that it would just be like four or five adult men walking around the cemetery, giggling, laughing, and pointing.
[23:49.170 --> 23:52.730]  Oh, God forbid we add a little joy to a sad place like a cemetery.
[23:52.750 --> 23:54.330]  You're saying that we're not being disrespectful.
[23:54.630 --> 24:01.050]  I'm just telling you that from a perception standpoint, it's maybe questionable.
[24:01.050 --> 24:07.330]  My point is that nothing we're doing is making fun of anybody in the cemetery.
[24:07.970 --> 24:11.210]  No, that is fine.
[24:11.610 --> 24:19.030]  I think the issue would be the perception of somebody who has a loved one in the cemetery being like,
[24:19.110 --> 24:21.870]  I'd rather you not put them into your game.
[24:22.990 --> 24:28.030]  Which is why you would choose people from... well, I mean, it's a public place, first of all.
[24:28.030 --> 24:30.910]  So there is the that of it.
[24:30.990 --> 24:36.730]  But also, I think that by not using anybody who died in your lifetime, you're really reducing the chances
[24:36.730 --> 24:42.130]  that somebody is going to see that you mentioned their uncle's name in passing,
[24:42.230 --> 24:46.030]  because his name was Carpenter or, I don't know, Shipwright or whatever.
[24:46.510 --> 24:47.910]  And it happens to be the name of a job.
[24:48.190 --> 24:52.350]  Didn't you say as well that the human race doesn't give a shit about anything 50 years ago or something?
[24:52.830 --> 24:53.610]  That's also true.
[24:53.610 --> 24:58.390]  50 years is when we stop giving a shit about the past or understanding it or trying to understand it,
[24:58.450 --> 25:00.950]  and it starts to disappear into the nothingness.
[25:01.050 --> 25:05.350]  So if anything, maybe we're bringing a little bit of life back to a bunch of people that died a long time ago
[25:05.350 --> 25:07.110]  that probably aren't getting a lot of attention.
[25:07.950 --> 25:11.810]  Well, that is a way to put it, but that would not be my intent.
[25:11.950 --> 25:14.290]  From a ghost standpoint, they probably fucking love it.
[25:14.630 --> 25:20.310]  I don't necessarily care that this person died or whatever.
[25:20.310 --> 25:23.410]  I'm really pumped about the bingo and my discovery of them.
[25:23.690 --> 25:24.050]  Yeah.
[25:24.170 --> 25:25.070]  If that makes sense.
[25:26.390 --> 25:28.710]  It's not that... I don't know.
[25:29.050 --> 25:33.010]  I like the idea a lot, I just think there are some hurdles to be considered.
[25:33.610 --> 25:38.950]  What if we test out this idea by going into a cemetery in a video game?
[25:39.690 --> 25:40.950]  I like that a lot.
[25:40.950 --> 25:41.390]  That's a great idea.
[25:41.950 --> 25:42.870]  I think that is great.
[25:44.910 --> 25:45.710]  I'm all about it.
[25:46.950 --> 25:47.910]  Red Dead?
[25:48.050 --> 25:50.230]  Friday the 13th has one.
[25:51.530 --> 25:54.030]  I'm looking right now to see.
[25:54.510 --> 25:56.250]  Oh, dude, you know who has a cemetery?
[25:57.170 --> 26:03.530]  One of the Mortal Kombat games, you progress through a cemetery.
[26:03.990 --> 26:05.650]  That's how the game progresses, right?
[26:06.230 --> 26:07.530]  Like 9 or 8, maybe?
[26:07.770 --> 26:09.150]  Resident Evil 4 has one.
[26:10.170 --> 26:11.810]  Does Left 4 Dead have a cemetery?
[26:11.970 --> 26:13.070]  It feels like they would have a cemetery.
[26:13.090 --> 26:14.430]  Yeah, it does.
[26:14.430 --> 26:18.590]  That seems like something that Valve would have the...
[26:18.590 --> 26:21.430]  Oh yeah, we gotta make sure these are all unique.
[26:22.150 --> 26:24.770]  They would have got each staff member to put in a different thing.
[26:24.850 --> 26:25.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:25.970 --> 26:26.770]  That's how that feels.
[26:28.330 --> 26:29.230]  This is good.
[26:29.510 --> 26:31.570]  We should definitely try this.
[26:31.570 --> 26:32.490]  I'm a big fan of that.
[26:32.570 --> 26:34.350]  I love the idea of more bingo.
[26:34.830 --> 26:36.230]  Like just as a general thing.
[26:36.870 --> 26:39.250]  Look, all I'm saying is I'm happy to do it in a video game.
[26:39.630 --> 26:41.250]  But cemeteries are just sitting there.
[26:41.410 --> 26:43.810]  I lived by one for a few years a few years ago.
[26:43.810 --> 26:45.370]  They're largely empty.
[26:45.530 --> 26:46.450]  Nobody's ever there.
[26:46.570 --> 26:47.690]  They're lonely places.
[26:48.030 --> 26:53.490]  I would go there sometimes and be the only person I saw there for like an hour if I walked through it.
[26:53.670 --> 27:02.990]  And I just feel like we could give them a little use in a fun way without being disrespectful to anybody interred there or visiting.
[27:06.070 --> 27:09.650]  Redfield... Redfall has a lot of cemetery in it.
[27:10.450 --> 27:11.090]  I haven't played that game.
[27:11.630 --> 27:12.150]  Is that a good game?
[27:14.310 --> 27:17.190]  There are good things about it, but it's confused.
[27:17.610 --> 27:20.530]  And the studio that made it recently got shut down.
[27:20.950 --> 27:23.510]  So it'll never sort those things out.
[27:23.790 --> 27:27.430]  I'm playing Still Wakes the Deep.
[27:27.750 --> 27:29.170]  Has anyone else tried that?
[27:29.310 --> 27:29.890]  It's on Game Pass.
[27:30.650 --> 27:33.370]  I would highly recommend you especially try it, Jeff.
[27:33.630 --> 27:36.390]  It's the thing, but on an oil rig.
[27:36.390 --> 27:38.870]  It's like the deep sea.
[27:39.030 --> 27:43.030]  You're out in the middle of the ocean and there's eldritch horror shit, right?
[27:43.450 --> 27:43.910]  What's it called?
[27:44.570 --> 27:46.030]  Still Wakes the Deep.
[27:46.470 --> 27:49.710]  You're on an oil rig and it's set in Scotland.
[27:50.370 --> 27:52.210]  And it is the thing.
[27:52.810 --> 27:53.330]  Is it multiplayer?
[27:54.070 --> 27:54.410]  No.
[27:54.610 --> 27:57.830]  It is a single player horror experience.
[27:58.330 --> 27:59.690]  But I'm having so much fun with it.
[27:59.750 --> 28:02.790]  I played it for maybe two hours last night.
[28:03.010 --> 28:04.150]  It was so scared.
[28:04.150 --> 28:09.130]  And I have a clip that I don't know if it would translate all that well on the podcast.
[28:09.270 --> 28:14.430]  But the whole thing is you are on this oil rig and you're drilling.
[28:14.690 --> 28:17.590]  And then something happens and this alien thing is taking over.
[28:18.250 --> 28:23.870]  And people that come in contact with it get turned into crazy people that are trying to kill you.
[28:24.030 --> 28:27.790]  And it's very visually disturbed horror.
[28:28.210 --> 28:32.630]  And I just encountered the very first monster that you have to deal with.
[28:32.630 --> 28:37.430]  And the whole time in the game, you'll find coffee cups on the ground that you can pick up and throw.
[28:38.130 --> 28:40.570]  And I thought, oh, I bet you these aren't weapons.
[28:40.710 --> 28:46.710]  This strikes me as like maybe you can try to throw them to a different corner of the room to distract so you can hide.
[28:47.430 --> 28:48.990]  And so I'm so scared.
[28:49.150 --> 28:50.850]  It has completely freaked me out.
[28:51.390 --> 28:52.910]  And I encounter this first monster.
[28:53.570 --> 28:55.750]  And you can hide in vents and stuff.
[28:56.350 --> 28:58.230]  And so I'm in a vent and I find a coffee cup.
[28:58.590 --> 29:01.770]  And it says you can throw it to distract the monster.
[29:01.770 --> 29:03.390]  It'll guide it to another place.
[29:03.730 --> 29:05.930]  And I fucking knew it. I called it. I knew it would be this.
[29:06.350 --> 29:09.270]  So I grabbed the coffee cup and I went to throw it.
[29:09.730 --> 29:10.690]  And it was dark.
[29:10.850 --> 29:12.830]  And I completely fucked up the throw.
[29:13.070 --> 29:18.070]  And instead of throwing it to the other corner of the room, I hit the pipe directly above me.
[29:18.370 --> 29:23.370]  And it bounced back at me and landed right in front of the grate that I was hiding behind.
[29:23.610 --> 29:27.370]  And that monster sprinted right to the grate in front of me.
[29:27.590 --> 29:29.510]  It's made me the most scared I've ever been in a game.
[29:29.510 --> 29:34.750]  Since it's the first encounter, I don't know how the rules work and if it can see me.
[29:35.090 --> 29:37.450]  Because there's just nothing in front of me. I'm just in a little vent.
[29:38.010 --> 29:39.310]  And we're equal to each other.
[29:39.690 --> 29:44.790]  And I just sat there for like 90 seconds as the monster analyzed the cup.
[29:44.930 --> 29:47.170]  And then went back and forth. And then went away.
[29:47.630 --> 29:50.430]  And that was it for me. I haven't gone back to that game yet.
[29:50.810 --> 29:51.550]  Did you save a clip?
[29:52.030 --> 29:55.730]  I do. Yeah, I have a clip. Let me see. I can pull it up.
[29:57.210 --> 30:00.110]  It's terrifying. I'd highly recommend it.
[30:00.570 --> 30:04.270]  It has a really cool achievement in it to play through the game in Gaelic.
[30:04.590 --> 30:09.270]  Because it's funny where they have English subtitles on by default.
[30:09.550 --> 30:13.350]  And it's not as like a thing of where the dialogue matches.
[30:13.570 --> 30:15.630]  It is to translate Scottish slang.
[30:15.950 --> 30:20.670]  Which I don't think I've ever played a game that has a feature like that.
[30:20.670 --> 30:25.310]  It is a lot of... the English text will say fuck.
[30:25.470 --> 30:27.730]  And the audible dialogue will be FUD.
[30:28.210 --> 30:30.370]  I've never heard so many FUDs dropped.
[30:32.510 --> 30:34.790]  Let me see if I can upload this.
[30:35.290 --> 30:37.190]  But I would highly recommend it.
[30:37.890 --> 30:41.090]  As someone who loves the thing, Jeff, like I know you do.
[30:41.490 --> 30:44.050]  I think you'd enjoy it even though it's single player and not multiplayer.
[30:44.890 --> 30:46.070]  Yeah, I'll check it out.
[30:47.050 --> 30:48.750]  I don't know when.
[30:49.170 --> 30:51.310]  Because you're right, I don't play a lot of single player anything.
[30:51.970 --> 30:52.810]  But I'll give it a shot.
[30:53.310 --> 30:54.830]  What was the last single player game you played?
[31:02.830 --> 31:05.810]  I played Far Cry 6 for a day.
[31:06.850 --> 31:07.730]  Was that single player?
[31:08.630 --> 31:10.290]  Yeah, I mean there's multiplayer in it.
[31:10.370 --> 31:11.650]  But yeah, you can play single player.
[31:11.990 --> 31:13.690]  Before that I played Cyberpunk.
[31:13.690 --> 31:15.890]  I beat that, so that's single player.
[31:16.790 --> 31:20.450]  I think it's so funny that you are multiplayer only essentially.
[31:20.650 --> 31:23.550]  And then Eric is on the other side of that spectrum.
[31:23.750 --> 31:26.130]  Of like essentially exclusively single player.
[31:26.410 --> 31:29.270]  I used to be single player only and I didn't give a shit about multiplayer.
[31:29.410 --> 31:30.170]  And I just kind of flipped.
[31:30.290 --> 31:32.570]  Because games are just...
[31:32.570 --> 31:36.590]  If I'm going to play a game now, I either want to be hanging out with my friends.
[31:37.070 --> 31:37.990]  Like shooting the shit.
[31:38.290 --> 31:39.290]  Or I want to be working.
[31:39.770 --> 31:43.550]  And so single player games have zero appeal to me at this point in my life.
[31:43.550 --> 31:45.470]  Because I'm not making anything with them.
[31:45.810 --> 31:46.730]  For the most part.
[31:46.990 --> 31:48.390]  Unless I'm like...
[31:49.410 --> 31:52.170]  Doing backgrounds for Nick or something.
[31:52.970 --> 31:55.310]  Yeah, and then if there's no multiplayer.
[31:55.570 --> 31:57.590]  There's no Xbox Live Party with Spotify music on.
[31:57.970 --> 31:59.090]  It just doesn't appeal.
[32:00.350 --> 32:02.090]  I've been doing some editing.
[32:02.630 --> 32:04.170]  Editing some Let's Plays we've been doing.
[32:04.370 --> 32:05.270]  Some of the multicams.
[32:05.610 --> 32:08.190]  And I looked and it had been exactly 10 years.
[32:08.450 --> 32:10.190]  Since my last multicam.
[32:10.250 --> 32:11.850]  Which was like a Minecraft video.
[32:12.630 --> 32:14.850]  So it's fun to dust off all that.
[32:15.270 --> 32:17.730]  But I forgot how much I just hate everyone.
[32:18.010 --> 32:19.010]  When I'm editing.
[32:21.350 --> 32:22.530]  What does that mean?
[32:23.110 --> 32:24.190]  Well, I got some examples.
[32:28.730 --> 32:30.250]  Discord. Alright, paste.
[32:31.090 --> 32:34.210]  That's my waveform from Gears of War 5.
[32:34.630 --> 32:35.270]  Part 1.
[32:36.530 --> 32:38.190]  It's all contained.
[32:38.830 --> 32:39.510]  It's pretty level.
[32:39.510 --> 32:42.250]  Not a lot of dynamic range.
[32:44.430 --> 32:46.110]  Geoff, any thoughts about where this is going?
[32:46.130 --> 32:46.770]  Here's Geoff.
[32:47.270 --> 32:49.070]  It's all the way down. It's all the way up.
[32:49.110 --> 32:51.110]  It's peak is blowing out like you wouldn't believe.
[32:51.170 --> 32:51.730]  It's crazy.
[32:52.790 --> 32:55.430]  And then somehow to my ear.
[32:55.490 --> 32:56.770]  Andrew sounded worse.
[32:57.350 --> 32:58.790]  And I looked at his waveform.
[33:00.070 --> 33:01.710]  Clipped all the way across.
[33:02.130 --> 33:05.410]  But actually not at the top of the thing.
[33:05.610 --> 33:07.630]  Which I don't see a lot of that.
[33:08.530 --> 33:10.290]  Nick, is it always like this?
[33:10.530 --> 33:11.670]  Not always. Sometimes.
[33:12.530 --> 33:13.510]  What's going on there?
[33:13.810 --> 33:15.950]  I don't know. I run a D-clip on it.
[33:16.050 --> 33:17.090]  And it usually takes care of it.
[33:17.270 --> 33:19.610]  But when he does gaming for some reason.
[33:19.810 --> 33:21.010]  His audio just...
[33:21.610 --> 33:22.250]  Clips out.
[33:22.990 --> 33:24.970]  What can I do to make your life easier?
[33:25.770 --> 33:27.130]  I've never heard this issue.
[33:27.510 --> 33:28.370]  What can I do to help?
[33:28.890 --> 33:32.130]  I have a compressor on so I don't blow out that much.
[33:32.630 --> 33:33.070]  That's true.
[33:33.070 --> 33:34.390]  It keeps everything down.
[33:34.390 --> 33:36.950]  Does my Scarlett have a compressor?
[33:37.550 --> 33:37.990]  I don't know.
[33:38.870 --> 33:39.930]  Not built in.
[33:40.070 --> 33:41.190]  But there might be a program we could use.
[33:41.590 --> 33:42.370]  We could look at it.
[33:43.690 --> 33:45.190]  We'll just play with your game.
[33:45.390 --> 33:46.490]  I think that'll take care of it.
[33:48.450 --> 33:49.250]  Sounds good.
[33:49.430 --> 33:50.190]  Sorry Gavin.
[33:53.070 --> 33:53.910]  I feel so bad.
[33:55.630 --> 33:56.430]  I'm absolved.
[33:56.530 --> 33:58.250]  None of my audio is this bad.
[33:58.370 --> 33:59.170]  I rock.
[33:59.650 --> 34:00.850]  Me and Gavin are great.
[34:01.470 --> 34:03.250]  I'm pretty sure yours was...
[34:03.250 --> 34:04.270]  You're not in this video.
[34:04.370 --> 34:05.810]  Which is why I don't have one for you.
[34:06.070 --> 34:06.630]  So I'm good.
[34:06.890 --> 34:10.050]  Your one from GTA was a nightmare.
[34:10.710 --> 34:11.870]  No, no, no.
[34:12.190 --> 34:12.830]  It was good.
[34:14.750 --> 34:15.950]  Consider that it was good.
[34:16.490 --> 34:18.210]  So how much does a compressor cost?
[34:18.290 --> 34:19.210]  And should I buy one?
[34:20.430 --> 34:22.390]  I think it's...
[34:22.390 --> 34:23.510]  Mine's just in my mixer.
[34:23.810 --> 34:24.530]  It's just an option.
[34:25.370 --> 34:26.730]  We'll look into it as Nick said.
[34:26.730 --> 34:27.410]  Yeah.
[34:28.150 --> 34:31.170]  I'm willing to spend some money to fix the problem.
[34:33.030 --> 34:35.230]  I'm willing to spend some money on your problem too.
[34:39.170 --> 34:41.130]  Trying to make your life easier here.
[34:42.690 --> 34:45.110]  Speaking of the gaming, I have the clip.
[34:45.610 --> 34:45.910]  I can post.
[34:47.810 --> 34:48.810]  Didn't fucking freeze.
[34:49.550 --> 34:50.110]  What an annoyance.
[34:50.310 --> 34:52.990]  Does it have a clipping issue in it?
[34:53.230 --> 34:53.630]  With your audio?
[34:53.630 --> 34:55.690]  Yeah, I think it's...
[34:55.690 --> 34:57.590]  I need to get a compressor for my computer.
[34:58.210 --> 35:00.050]  Oh my god.
[35:01.670 --> 35:02.590]  Oh my god.
[35:03.390 --> 35:04.510]  Sorry, go ahead, Eric.
[35:04.570 --> 35:05.770]  I was going to say...
[35:07.130 --> 35:09.610]  While Andrew wrestles with that, I guess.
[35:09.970 --> 35:12.590]  I want to give a shout out to a regulation listener.
[35:12.950 --> 35:14.690]  I mean, a comment leaver, truly.
[35:16.430 --> 35:18.550]  This is from Donut Cool.
[35:18.830 --> 35:20.550]  On the subreddit.
[35:20.710 --> 35:21.990]  They've been doing this weekly.
[35:21.990 --> 35:24.490]  They have been doing regulation drawings
[35:24.490 --> 35:26.390]  of each episode of Moments
[35:26.390 --> 35:27.410]  that stick out to them.
[35:27.570 --> 35:29.170]  And I just want to shout them out.
[35:29.990 --> 35:31.190]  They are so good.
[35:31.510 --> 35:34.170]  They do this every week and I look forward to it every week.
[35:34.230 --> 35:35.590]  I wanted to shout them out on the show because
[35:35.590 --> 35:37.210]  I think this is...
[35:37.210 --> 35:39.750]  The immunity bullet on a necklace
[35:39.750 --> 35:41.010]  is so cool.
[35:41.390 --> 35:43.990]  The emotional noises opera thing
[35:43.990 --> 35:44.890]  is so good.
[35:45.230 --> 35:48.290]  But Nick as the monkey
[35:48.290 --> 35:49.690]  being lured
[35:49.690 --> 35:51.770]  into a cartoon trap
[35:51.770 --> 35:53.550]  is so well drawn.
[35:53.870 --> 35:55.190]  They draw it by hand,
[35:55.350 --> 35:57.490]  pencil and paper, and just shoot a photo
[35:57.490 --> 35:59.110]  of it on their phone.
[35:59.370 --> 36:01.310]  They're not trying to be high quality with it.
[36:01.390 --> 36:03.270]  It is just, here's an idea.
[36:03.470 --> 36:05.230]  And they scribble it. I love
[36:05.230 --> 36:07.070]  that they do this. I think it's fantastic.
[36:07.230 --> 36:09.210]  Thank you, Donut Cool, on the subreddit.
[36:09.590 --> 36:11.070]  That's exactly how I imagined it.
[36:13.570 --> 36:16.030]  Can I ask, without getting into a whole thing,
[36:16.110 --> 36:17.630]  can I ask an immunity bullet
[36:17.630 --> 36:19.030]  question? Of course.
[36:20.270 --> 36:21.970]  I'm not trying to relitigate the whole thing.
[36:22.090 --> 36:23.610]  Andrew's not allowed to say of course.
[36:24.110 --> 36:24.710]  This is ridiculous.
[36:25.170 --> 36:27.290]  It's just a specific scenario
[36:27.290 --> 36:28.990]  that I'd like to get cleared up, Gavin.
[36:29.090 --> 36:30.390]  If you had the immunity bullet,
[36:30.470 --> 36:34.050]  you're immune from any kind of...
[36:34.050 --> 36:35.390]  Is that...
[36:35.390 --> 36:36.550]  Say you're Christian.
[36:37.250 --> 36:39.630]  You're pretty religious and you shoot somebody.
[36:40.110 --> 36:41.630]  But you're immune to it, so that means you're cool
[36:41.630 --> 36:42.370]  with God, right?
[36:44.090 --> 36:45.250]  If you're a Christian,
[36:45.250 --> 36:46.790]  or let's say God exists, right?
[36:46.830 --> 36:49.110]  Or some form of God exists, and it's still a mortal
[36:49.110 --> 36:51.490]  sin to commit suicide, if you shot yourself
[36:51.490 --> 36:52.930]  with an immunity bullet, would you be good?
[36:53.830 --> 36:54.530]  Yeah, you would...
[36:55.030 --> 36:57.210]  I mean, Eric was gonna use the bullet for that
[36:57.210 --> 36:59.090]  last week, and we decided that he would survive.
[36:59.750 --> 37:01.570]  I didn't ask the question.
[37:01.850 --> 37:02.570]  I just...
[37:02.570 --> 37:05.190]  I was gonna roll the dice on I was gonna go to heaven
[37:05.190 --> 37:05.750]  for that.
[37:07.570 --> 37:08.910]  It seems like you'd be okay.
[37:09.290 --> 37:10.290]  I think you would walk it off.
[37:11.670 --> 37:12.070]  Fantastic.
[37:12.610 --> 37:13.410]  Okay, thanks.
[37:13.970 --> 37:14.690]  There's the clip.
[37:15.990 --> 37:17.350]  So I'm playing this clip.
[37:18.030 --> 37:20.510]  Yeah, do you wanna sync up and then...
[37:20.510 --> 37:21.790]  3, 2,
[37:22.030 --> 37:23.130]  1, play.
[37:24.410 --> 37:26.070]  Okay, so you can see I'm like...
[37:26.070 --> 37:27.790]  I'm walking around, I get into this vent.
[37:27.950 --> 37:28.830]  It's very dark.
[37:29.690 --> 37:32.170]  Whenever there's purple stuff around
[37:32.170 --> 37:34.090]  the screen, that means you're close to the enemy.
[37:35.630 --> 37:36.070]  That...
[37:36.070 --> 37:37.330]  is the guy.
[37:38.290 --> 37:39.730]  Oh no, okay, here we go. Flashlight on.
[37:39.730 --> 37:41.430]  So I'm trying to navigate.
[37:41.930 --> 37:43.710]  I'm really nervous. These little
[37:43.710 --> 37:45.050]  pipes, or like vents,
[37:45.730 --> 37:47.570]  you can hide in. Anything
[37:47.570 --> 37:49.730]  painted yellow, so I'm tip-toeing.
[37:49.950 --> 37:51.150]  Cause that's him, right there.
[37:51.230 --> 37:52.570]  That's that monster thing.
[37:53.130 --> 37:55.010]  So I'm like, coffee cup, got it.
[37:55.130 --> 37:57.030]  Throw it across the room. Oh fuck!
[37:57.290 --> 37:59.770]  Oh fuck, it bounced back! And it immediately
[37:59.770 --> 38:01.650]  runs right at the cup.
[38:01.930 --> 38:03.070]  And I'm just sweating.
[38:03.510 --> 38:05.770]  I'm like, oh my god. Oh fuck.
[38:06.250 --> 38:07.730]  And since I've never encountered a monster
[38:07.730 --> 38:09.670]  before, I'm like, will it see me?
[38:09.670 --> 38:11.050]  Am I okay in here?
[38:11.710 --> 38:13.750]  I'm just not gonna move. We're just
[38:13.750 --> 38:15.950]  not gonna move. Please don't come in here.
[38:16.570 --> 38:17.670]  And it goes
[38:17.670 --> 38:19.210]  back and forth and it scans.
[38:19.570 --> 38:21.870]  I'm like, okay, I think it's gone. I think we're good.
[38:22.370 --> 38:23.730]  And then it leaves. And then I just
[38:23.730 --> 38:25.390]  went to bed. I just shut the game off.
[38:25.590 --> 38:27.190]  I can't do this.
[38:27.510 --> 38:29.790]  This is too much. That could certainly go
[38:29.790 --> 38:32.050]  into a worst throws in video games compilation.
[38:32.610 --> 38:33.670]  You have immediately
[38:33.670 --> 38:35.270]  sold me on that game. That looks awesome.
[38:35.270 --> 38:37.350]  Yeah, it looks great. It's really cool.
[38:37.710 --> 38:38.810]  What's wrong with that bloke?
[38:39.570 --> 38:41.230]  Uh, it's... I don't know. I think
[38:41.230 --> 38:43.270]  it's like a... He's just under the weather.
[38:44.010 --> 38:45.270]  Yeah. He's got shingles?
[38:46.790 --> 38:47.190]  Yeah.
[38:47.450 --> 38:49.050]  I think that's why you won't get that vaccine.
[38:49.930 --> 38:51.250]  By a ratty boy video game.
[38:51.450 --> 38:52.630]  It just didn't seem to happen.
[38:53.010 --> 38:55.270]  It's a reaction to it. Fuck you.
[38:59.730 --> 39:00.530]  It's great.
[39:01.470 --> 39:02.990]  What have you guys been up to recently?
[39:03.670 --> 39:04.950]  Jeff, it was your birthday
[39:04.950 --> 39:06.990]  yesterday. We recorded drafts.
[39:07.790 --> 39:09.630]  How are we feeling about the drafts?
[39:10.450 --> 39:11.010]  Uh...
[39:11.010 --> 39:13.210]  I feel like the second and third were fucking amazing.
[39:13.710 --> 39:14.810]  I liked all of them.
[39:15.790 --> 39:16.350]  Um...
[39:16.350 --> 39:18.730]  I'm excited to see the reaction to it.
[39:19.050 --> 39:20.930]  The last draft that we did.
[39:21.530 --> 39:22.790]  I think there's gonna be
[39:23.970 --> 39:25.330]  some unhappy people.
[39:25.750 --> 39:27.150]  Should we name the drafts?
[39:27.510 --> 39:28.590]  I think it's a great idea.
[39:29.070 --> 39:30.990]  We had...
[39:30.990 --> 39:31.710]  Breakfast foods.
[39:31.970 --> 39:35.130]  Then we had TV show
[39:35.130 --> 39:36.330]  theme songs.
[39:37.170 --> 39:39.230]  Not sitcoms, any TV show
[39:39.230 --> 39:39.710]  theme song.
[39:40.010 --> 39:42.710]  Then we had...
[39:42.710 --> 39:44.150]  Non-alcoholic beverages.
[39:47.810 --> 39:48.450]  Which...
[39:48.990 --> 39:49.450]  I...
[39:50.170 --> 39:53.250]  I don't think people can predict the level of chaos
[39:53.250 --> 39:54.030]  that occurred.
[39:55.270 --> 39:56.530]  You wouldn't think...
[39:56.530 --> 39:59.390]  It was a big topic of discussion at dinner last night.
[40:00.050 --> 40:01.250]  You wouldn't have thought that
[40:01.250 --> 40:03.250]  non-alcoholic drinks was the most
[40:03.250 --> 40:04.950]  contentious of all of those.
[40:05.690 --> 40:06.210]  Divisive!
[40:07.110 --> 40:09.350]  Yeah, I wouldn't say contentious, but definitely
[40:09.350 --> 40:10.130]  divisive.
[40:11.850 --> 40:12.890]  Interesting picks.
[40:13.690 --> 40:15.610]  And it's fucking Nick with his innocent
[40:15.610 --> 40:16.530]  yeah over there.
[40:17.130 --> 40:19.130]  Like he's not most of the problem.
[40:19.610 --> 40:20.690]  Most of?
[40:21.030 --> 40:22.630]  All of? Either way.
[40:22.810 --> 40:23.730]  Uh-uh, uh-uh.
[40:25.850 --> 40:27.570]  It's so much fun doing these games
[40:27.570 --> 40:29.350]  with you, because I don't think we've talked about
[40:29.350 --> 40:31.550]  on the podcast, but we did
[40:31.550 --> 40:33.690]  the Summer Movie League supplemental.
[40:34.150 --> 40:34.870]  Yeah, we did.
[40:35.470 --> 40:37.090]  Which is in full swing.
[40:38.150 --> 40:39.590]  And it has been so
[40:39.590 --> 40:41.510]  much fun seeing the community get
[40:41.510 --> 40:43.490]  behind it the way they have, and creating
[40:43.490 --> 40:45.370]  the tools that they've made
[40:45.370 --> 40:47.490]  for tracking stuff. Like there's
[40:47.490 --> 40:48.850]  a website you can go to
[40:48.850 --> 40:50.910]  that just keeps things updated.
[40:51.110 --> 40:52.770]  What's the standings? Yeah, you wanna give it an update?
[40:53.330 --> 40:55.170]  No, I don't. Someone should pull it up.
[40:55.170 --> 40:57.370]  I think Gavin is killing right now, right?
[40:57.950 --> 40:59.430]  Yeah, because you just had
[40:59.430 --> 41:01.350]  a big movie. I had 15 bucks for a while.
[41:02.250 --> 41:03.370]  Well, you had Bad Boys
[41:03.370 --> 41:04.930]  and Inside Out 2 back to back, I think.
[41:05.170 --> 41:07.190]  So that was... That's your whole
[41:07.190 --> 41:07.870]  summer right there.
[41:08.870 --> 41:11.390]  I mean, Bad Boys, in my opinion, overperformed.
[41:11.750 --> 41:13.270]  I think it was a way bigger
[41:13.270 --> 41:15.210]  hit. I totally agree. I did not think that
[41:15.210 --> 41:17.750]  movie was gonna do well. I mean, have either of you seen it?
[41:17.870 --> 41:19.030]  No. Well, how did it
[41:19.030 --> 41:21.330]  overperform? Because I read
[41:21.330 --> 41:22.330]  that it made a lot of money.
[41:23.230 --> 41:24.390]  It was on a trailer
[41:24.390 --> 41:25.350]  and then it did well.
[41:27.290 --> 41:28.370]  Got the stamp of
[41:28.370 --> 41:29.570]  approval by TPG.
[41:30.570 --> 41:32.010]  I asked him what his thoughts were
[41:32.010 --> 41:34.170]  because I wouldn't even consider watching it unless
[41:34.170 --> 41:36.350]  he approved it. Said it's way
[41:36.350 --> 41:38.330]  better than 3. Well, 3
[41:38.330 --> 41:40.510]  was fucking pretty rough.
[41:40.750 --> 41:42.030]  So if it's better than 3, that's
[41:42.030 --> 41:44.390]  encouraging, I guess. Found the website.
[41:44.930 --> 41:45.370]  Currently
[41:46.190 --> 41:48.130]  in first is
[41:48.130 --> 41:50.270]  Gavin Free with $326
[41:50.270 --> 41:51.970]  million. Second
[41:51.970 --> 41:54.110]  place is myself
[41:54.110 --> 41:56.230]  with $104
[41:56.230 --> 41:58.210]  million, $900,000.
[41:58.770 --> 42:00.450]  Third place is Jeff
[42:00.450 --> 42:02.130]  $104
[42:02.130 --> 42:03.950]  million, $100,000.
[42:04.530 --> 42:05.350]  Andrew,
[42:06.010 --> 42:08.410]  fourth place, $94,000.
[42:08.470 --> 42:10.230]  Nick, fifth
[42:10.230 --> 42:11.270]  place, almost
[42:12.110 --> 42:14.210]  there. So Nick, I'm
[42:14.210 --> 42:15.950]  sorry, Andrew has $94 million.
[42:16.410 --> 42:17.790]  Nick, almost there,
[42:17.790 --> 42:19.830]  $13 million. So the
[42:19.830 --> 42:22.010]  difference between first to worse
[42:22.010 --> 42:23.790]  is $313
[42:25.110 --> 42:25.510]  million.
[42:26.330 --> 42:27.330]  But Nick
[42:27.950 --> 42:29.750]  doesn't have... I think the only
[42:29.750 --> 42:31.850]  things that he's had that have come out so far
[42:31.850 --> 42:33.370]  are Sight
[42:33.370 --> 42:35.990]  and Back to Black, a movie
[42:35.990 --> 42:37.770]  that is no longer in theaters.
[42:38.890 --> 42:39.490]  They pulled it.
[42:39.770 --> 42:41.750]  They did pull it. But he has
[42:41.750 --> 42:43.590]  in June, late June,
[42:43.910 --> 42:45.950]  Nick has on the 28th, Blue Lock
[42:45.950 --> 42:47.710]  episode Nagi, and
[42:47.710 --> 42:49.750]  A Quiet Place Day One.
[42:50.150 --> 42:52.330]  Those are both on the 28th.
[42:52.450 --> 42:53.230]  And then,
[42:53.850 --> 42:56.030]  and then, 4th of
[42:56.030 --> 42:58.010]  July weekend, opening
[42:58.010 --> 42:59.950]  on July 3rd,
[43:00.090 --> 43:01.950]  Nick has Despicable Me
[43:01.950 --> 43:04.110]  4. That's gonna make so much
[43:04.110 --> 43:04.510]  money.
[43:06.050 --> 43:08.050]  That's gonna be a pretty big
[43:08.050 --> 43:10.050]  movie for you. Make sure you check out
[43:10.050 --> 43:11.770]  Summer Movie... what?
[43:12.290 --> 43:13.330]  Summer Movie Auctions.
[43:13.330 --> 43:14.410]  Ah, sod it.
[43:15.530 --> 43:16.210]  Ah, sod it.
[43:17.410 --> 43:18.550]  Shut up, you idiot.
[43:21.790 --> 43:23.430]  Mush mouth boron.
[43:25.610 --> 43:27.770]  But you can check it out
[43:27.770 --> 43:29.590]  as a supplemental on our YouTube
[43:29.590 --> 43:31.350]  channel, the Summer Movie
[43:31.350 --> 43:33.270]  Auction. It's so cool
[43:33.270 --> 43:35.350]  seeing these resources because this is a thing I did with my
[43:35.350 --> 43:37.330]  friends for years, and it was
[43:37.330 --> 43:39.410]  just me checking Box Office Mojo
[43:39.410 --> 43:41.350]  every weekend going one at a time with
[43:41.350 --> 43:43.110]  a calculator. It's like seeing
[43:43.110 --> 43:45.430]  automated stuff. It's like, holy shit.
[43:45.730 --> 43:47.170]  People have figured out. This is amazing.
[43:47.250 --> 43:49.250]  Why did I spend 11 points
[43:49.250 --> 43:50.510]  on Borderlands?
[43:51.090 --> 43:53.510]  Because it's a video game
[43:53.510 --> 43:55.450]  property, and it had Kevin Hart
[43:55.450 --> 43:56.650]  in it, and you thought maybe.
[43:57.470 --> 43:59.390]  And Harold and the Purple Crown
[43:59.390 --> 44:00.090]  only spent 3.
[44:01.150 --> 44:02.570]  Yeah, some of the prices are crazy.
[44:03.270 --> 44:05.370]  I think Horizon Kevin
[44:06.410 --> 44:07.370]  Costner's western
[44:08.350 --> 44:09.310]  fantasy comes
[44:09.310 --> 44:11.330]  out this weekend, right? Yes, it does.
[44:12.370 --> 44:13.410]  I think
[44:13.410 --> 44:15.130]  it's next week. It's the 28th.
[44:15.350 --> 44:17.350]  But I guess by the time
[44:17.350 --> 44:18.890]  this is out, it will be coming out this weekend.
[44:19.490 --> 44:21.370]  Jeff spent 22 points on
[44:21.370 --> 44:22.730]  it, but that's okay.
[44:23.830 --> 44:24.850]  Gavin spent
[44:24.850 --> 44:27.150]  6 on chapter 2.
[44:27.590 --> 44:28.830]  It comes out in August.
[44:29.710 --> 44:31.270]  Gavin doesn't have anything
[44:31.270 --> 44:33.130]  coming out between now and
[44:33.130 --> 44:34.810]  August 16th.
[44:34.950 --> 44:35.930]  I'm just chilling.
[44:38.510 --> 44:39.050]  To
[44:40.110 --> 44:40.950]  further help
[44:40.950 --> 44:42.290]  myself win this contest,
[44:42.690 --> 44:44.470]  Millie and I, on Father's Day,
[44:44.530 --> 44:45.390]  went and saw If.
[44:46.710 --> 44:48.490]  Because that's where I've been making the bulk
[44:48.490 --> 44:48.930]  of my money.
[44:49.710 --> 44:52.070]  What a hunk of shit my movie
[44:52.070 --> 44:52.690]  If is.
[44:54.310 --> 44:55.110]  How many
[44:55.850 --> 44:57.970]  more movies are we going to let Ryan Reynolds
[44:57.970 --> 44:59.230]  get away with?
[44:59.890 --> 45:02.070]  I think John Krasinski directed that
[45:02.070 --> 45:03.430]  film, too. He created it.
[45:03.430 --> 45:03.850]  Yes.
[45:05.870 --> 45:07.290]  It's a very
[45:07.290 --> 45:09.250]  well-cast movie
[45:09.250 --> 45:11.310]  with a lot of really talented people, but man, is that
[45:11.310 --> 45:12.850]  story all just a mess.
[45:13.930 --> 45:14.910]  Today's top story,
[45:15.150 --> 45:17.350]  the flavor merger of the century between
[45:17.350 --> 45:19.270]  the peanut butter group and Chocolatey Corp.
[45:19.450 --> 45:21.290]  Joining me is a PBC executive.
[45:21.610 --> 45:22.510]  Thanks for having me, Barry.
[45:22.910 --> 45:25.570]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct
[45:25.570 --> 45:27.430]  of it, Jif peanut butter and chocolate
[45:27.430 --> 45:29.110]  flavored spread, would be a success?
[45:29.550 --> 45:31.390]  You know, it was a gut feeling.
[45:31.390 --> 45:33.390]  A rumbling, if you will.
[45:33.770 --> 45:35.370]  Besides, they're two titans
[45:35.370 --> 45:37.390]  of taste. Very true. Goes
[45:37.390 --> 45:39.050]  great with pretzels. And pancakes.
[45:39.590 --> 45:41.250]  Apples, too, I bet. Try Jif
[45:41.250 --> 45:41.990]  PBC today.
[45:43.970 --> 45:45.590]  Finding a new job
[45:45.590 --> 45:46.930]  is stressful.
[45:47.790 --> 45:49.470]  But with Indeed, it doesn't have
[45:49.470 --> 45:51.330]  to be. Just fill out
[45:51.330 --> 45:53.350]  your Indeed profile with your skills,
[45:53.650 --> 45:55.430]  experience, and desired salary.
[45:56.130 --> 45:57.210]  The more you fill out,
[45:57.270 --> 45:58.890]  the better your matches will be.
[45:58.890 --> 46:00.970]  And hearing from hiring managers
[46:00.970 --> 46:02.890]  will be two times more likely.
[46:03.790 --> 46:04.350]  Relax.
[46:05.130 --> 46:06.510]  That's your Indeed profile,
[46:06.710 --> 46:08.830]  sending opportunities your way.
[46:09.490 --> 46:11.070]  Indeed, the world
[46:11.070 --> 46:12.150]  can work better.
[46:13.030 --> 46:14.610]  Do you guys have
[46:15.170 --> 46:17.030]  celebrities or movie stars or whatever
[46:17.030 --> 46:19.030]  that, for you, walk a
[46:19.030 --> 46:20.890]  thin line where you're just going, like,
[46:21.270 --> 46:22.810]  you can't get many more chances.
[46:23.170 --> 46:25.050]  Like, ooh, I'm keeping an eye
[46:25.050 --> 46:27.090]  on you. Do you have anyone like that?
[46:27.090 --> 46:29.290]  I felt that way about Russell Brand
[46:30.030 --> 46:31.210]  when he was in...
[46:31.210 --> 46:33.170]  when Hollywood really tried to make Russell
[46:33.170 --> 46:35.070]  Brand a thing, from, like,
[46:35.130 --> 46:37.210]  forgetting Sarah Marshall to get him to the Greek
[46:37.210 --> 46:39.210]  to... he was in, like, the Arthur
[46:39.210 --> 46:41.570]  remake. There were, like, three years
[46:41.570 --> 46:43.210]  where I didn't find him enjoyable
[46:43.210 --> 46:45.190]  in anything that he did, but he
[46:45.190 --> 46:47.310]  just kept getting huge movies
[46:47.310 --> 46:48.750]  and I did not get it.
[46:49.350 --> 46:50.550]  I liked him in Sarah Marshall.
[46:51.310 --> 46:53.150]  That was, like, the one thing
[46:53.150 --> 46:55.130]  that he was, like, perfect for, but
[46:55.130 --> 46:57.130]  then it was just that in everything he
[46:57.130 --> 46:59.010]  did. And it just didn't
[46:59.010 --> 46:59.830]  work the same.
[47:02.110 --> 47:02.590]  Uh...
[47:02.970 --> 47:05.270]  I feel that way about Jake Gyllenhaal.
[47:05.910 --> 47:07.110]  Really? Oh, that's a good
[47:07.110 --> 47:08.610]  one. That's a really good one.
[47:08.910 --> 47:10.730]  He had such a good run, though.
[47:11.190 --> 47:13.290]  He did. He did, for a while.
[47:13.690 --> 47:14.930]  Yeah. But, like,
[47:15.090 --> 47:17.150]  remember when he was in Zodiac?
[47:17.790 --> 47:19.070]  And, like, that was
[47:19.070 --> 47:20.230]  at the same time
[47:20.810 --> 47:23.210]  when he was in Jarhead? Remember that
[47:23.210 --> 47:24.970]  movie, Jarhead? And, like,
[47:25.370 --> 47:27.550]  he was such a fuckin' piece of shit
[47:27.550 --> 47:28.990]  while making Zodiac
[47:28.990 --> 47:31.090]  because everyone kept telling him, dude, Jarhead is gonna be
[47:31.090 --> 47:33.010]  huge. And Jarhead was fuckin' nothing.
[47:33.370 --> 47:35.090]  And then he was like, oh, yeah, I really
[47:35.090 --> 47:37.090]  did not try on Zodiac. And it's like,
[47:37.230 --> 47:39.110]  why? It's like, it couldn't
[47:40.110 --> 47:41.190]  uh... what an
[47:41.190 --> 47:41.630]  asshole.
[47:45.870 --> 47:46.470]  Who else?
[47:47.050 --> 47:49.090]  I have it with Sidney
[47:49.090 --> 47:51.150]  Sweeney right now, which is such a bummer
[47:51.150 --> 47:53.190]  because I think she's cool, but she
[47:53.190 --> 47:54.650]  can't keep getting away with it.
[47:54.850 --> 47:56.050]  Like, she did
[47:56.830 --> 47:58.870]  Anyone But You and
[47:59.350 --> 48:01.190]  Madam Web. And no one
[48:01.190 --> 48:02.990]  is, like, going after her.
[48:03.270 --> 48:04.970]  And then also, the other half of
[48:04.970 --> 48:07.110]  Anyone But You, the other person who's on my fuckin'
[48:07.210 --> 48:09.110]  list is Glenn Powell. The guy who
[48:09.110 --> 48:10.470]  looks like a human capybara.
[48:10.910 --> 48:13.510]  Like, he is...
[48:13.510 --> 48:15.090]  That guy runs our wives'
[48:15.270 --> 48:16.770]  podcast, man. Yes!
[48:16.910 --> 48:18.750]  And I can't... oh, man.
[48:18.750 --> 48:20.690]  Like, he's never
[48:20.690 --> 48:22.590]  gonna escape this tweet for me where
[48:22.590 --> 48:24.750]  somebody said he looks like a capybara who
[48:24.750 --> 48:26.810]  made a wish to become human. Like, that
[48:26.810 --> 48:28.510]  is what Glenn Powell looks like.
[48:28.650 --> 48:30.690]  Did you see that thing where his parents held up the
[48:30.690 --> 48:32.790]  signs saying, stop trying to make Glenn Powell happen?
[48:32.970 --> 48:33.950]  Glenn Powell's not gonna happen. Awesome!
[48:34.430 --> 48:36.730]  It was really funny. At least he's aware of it.
[48:37.010 --> 48:38.770]  But I also think Dakota Johnson
[48:38.770 --> 48:39.990]  is on that list for me, too.
[48:40.630 --> 48:42.050]  That's a great one, dude!
[48:42.210 --> 48:44.390]  A great one! If she
[48:44.390 --> 48:46.910]  wasn't Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson's
[48:46.910 --> 48:49.110]  kid, she would not be in movies anymore.
[48:49.450 --> 48:51.070]  Period. After fucking
[48:51.070 --> 48:52.950]  Fifty Shades of Grey, she was in
[48:52.950 --> 48:54.490]  Fifty Shades! That's crazy!
[48:55.150 --> 48:56.790]  Like, and then Madam
[48:56.790 --> 48:58.690]  Webb, and I just don't, you know.
[48:58.990 --> 49:00.950]  She'll be in Hollywood for our
[49:00.950 --> 49:02.990]  entire lifetimes because of this
[49:02.990 --> 49:04.830]  or whatever, and I think she is
[49:04.830 --> 49:06.910]  very affable. Like, as a person, I think she's
[49:06.910 --> 49:08.850]  affable, but I don't know her
[49:08.850 --> 49:10.810]  as a fucking person. I have to see her
[49:10.810 --> 49:12.910]  in the media and in movies, and she
[49:12.910 --> 49:13.890]  can't keep getting away with it.
[49:14.630 --> 49:15.850]  Who is somebody
[49:15.850 --> 49:18.070]  who's the opposite who they will, like, forever
[49:18.070 --> 49:19.870]  have a pass with you no matter what?
[49:19.950 --> 49:21.970]  Because they're just so good on
[49:21.970 --> 49:23.670]  screen. Walton Goggins.
[49:24.110 --> 49:25.630]  Oh yeah, Walton Goggins. That's a good one.
[49:26.030 --> 49:27.330]  That's a really good one.
[49:27.950 --> 49:29.810]  I feel like if ever I see Idris Elba
[49:29.810 --> 49:31.890]  in something, I want to watch it, even though he's been
[49:31.890 --> 49:33.090]  in some real stinkers.
[49:34.350 --> 49:35.230]  Clancy Brown?
[49:35.990 --> 49:36.830]  That's a good one.
[49:38.530 --> 49:40.050]  Oh, I'm with Nick.
[49:40.290 --> 49:41.750]  Timothy Olyphant. I
[49:41.750 --> 49:43.650]  really like Timothy Olyphant
[49:43.650 --> 49:46.030]  a lot. I think he does good stuff.
[49:46.990 --> 49:47.950]  For me,
[49:48.690 --> 49:49.170]  it's...
[49:51.350 --> 49:51.830]  Dreamcatcher?
[49:52.410 --> 49:53.890]  Again, but that's
[49:53.890 --> 49:55.710]  why we're saying, gets a pass, baby.
[49:56.390 --> 49:57.770]  I think, for me,
[49:57.850 --> 49:59.770]  it's probably, it's a little bit of an obvious
[49:59.770 --> 50:01.910]  pick, but Denzel Washington. Like, I will see anything
[50:01.910 --> 50:03.750]  with Denzel Washington, but I guess my
[50:03.750 --> 50:05.330]  less obvious pick would be Forrest Whitaker.
[50:05.910 --> 50:07.950]  I will forever trust
[50:07.950 --> 50:09.750]  Forrest Whitaker in anything I see of him.
[50:09.750 --> 50:11.090]  Even if it's that bad
[50:12.030 --> 50:13.470]  fucking accent in Rogue One.
[50:13.790 --> 50:15.050]  I'm still not holding it against him.
[50:17.570 --> 50:19.910]  Yeah, it's like actors that you rely
[50:19.910 --> 50:21.950]  on their performances, right? And not necessarily
[50:21.950 --> 50:23.470]  the movie. Absolutely.
[50:23.870 --> 50:25.830]  Forrest Whitaker is not, to me, a stamp of
[50:25.830 --> 50:27.410]  confidence that this will be a good movie.
[50:27.910 --> 50:30.090]  But I can rely on him to deliver.
[50:30.410 --> 50:31.850]  You know Forrest Whitaker will be
[50:31.850 --> 50:33.410]  good enough that the movie's worth it.
[50:33.670 --> 50:35.810]  Is how I feel about him. Yeah.
[50:36.750 --> 50:37.190]  Bloodsport?
[50:40.670 --> 50:42.350]  Forgot that he was in that.
[50:42.710 --> 50:44.190]  By the way, Bloodsport's a great movie.
[50:44.690 --> 50:45.810]  Fucking awesome. I love it.
[50:45.830 --> 50:47.870]  It was one of the best movies of my childhood. Bloodsport
[50:47.870 --> 50:49.790]  and Kickboxer were fucking
[50:49.790 --> 50:51.890]  awesome. Like, there was no kid
[50:51.890 --> 50:53.830]  on Earth who didn't like those movies when
[50:53.830 --> 50:55.830]  they came out. Yeah, and also they're like
[50:55.830 --> 50:57.590]  the same movie. It's fucking awesome. It's great.
[50:57.770 --> 50:59.410]  Even better. You get to see the same movie twice.
[50:59.790 --> 51:01.890]  It's like watching the first four...
[51:02.410 --> 51:03.370]  Fuck, what's his name?
[51:04.530 --> 51:05.190]  Steven Seagal.
[51:05.650 --> 51:07.670]  It's like watching the first four Steven Seagal movies.
[51:07.670 --> 51:09.690]  Those movies are fucking amazing.
[51:10.210 --> 51:11.930]  It just sucks that he sucks.
[51:12.330 --> 51:13.730]  Marked for Death, Out for
[51:13.730 --> 51:15.630]  Justice, uh, I don't remember the
[51:15.630 --> 51:17.070]  others. Those are fucking awesome.
[51:17.710 --> 51:19.710]  Under Siege? Hard to Kill was the
[51:19.710 --> 51:20.310]  other one? Yeah.
[51:21.610 --> 51:23.630]  Under Siege has Tommy Lee Jones looking all crazy.
[51:23.950 --> 51:25.710]  He does. And Gary Busey
[51:25.710 --> 51:27.350]  in a dress. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:28.490 --> 51:29.530]  Tommy Lee Jones, hang on.
[51:29.890 --> 51:31.690]  Andrew, I gotta show you a picture of Tommy Lee Jones
[51:31.690 --> 51:33.570]  in this fucking movie. Please. Because it's not what you
[51:33.570 --> 51:34.510]  expect. It's awesome.
[51:35.230 --> 51:36.330]  Tommy Lee Jones
[51:37.090 --> 51:37.570]  has... Oh.
[51:38.010 --> 51:39.610]  He has a line...
[51:39.610 --> 51:42.270]  He has a line in Under Siege
[51:42.270 --> 51:44.330]  about a revolution always coming back around
[51:44.330 --> 51:46.430]  in your face, and I wrote it, I used
[51:46.430 --> 51:48.350]  it in like a sociology class in college
[51:48.350 --> 51:50.050]  and my professor was like,
[51:50.330 --> 51:52.250]  Wow, that's incredible! That's so good!
[51:52.530 --> 51:54.330]  A movement stops, but a revolution
[51:54.330 --> 51:56.190]  keeps coming back around! And I'm like, yeah,
[51:56.310 --> 51:57.950]  fuck yeah. That's so cool.
[52:00.070 --> 52:00.550]  Yeah.
[52:00.870 --> 52:02.470]  I wouldn't watch anything Steven
[52:02.470 --> 52:04.690]  Seagal made after 1991 or so,
[52:04.850 --> 52:06.450]  but from Under Siege back,
[52:06.710 --> 52:08.490]  the dude made good... I mean, the dude sucks,
[52:08.590 --> 52:09.830]  don't get me wrong, but he made good movies.
[52:10.190 --> 52:12.010]  What's with his frickin' arms?
[52:12.610 --> 52:14.250]  What? Like, they always
[52:14.250 --> 52:16.490]  fling all about weird. Have you seen his running
[52:16.490 --> 52:18.710]  arms? He says
[52:18.710 --> 52:20.610]  that he has the perfect
[52:20.610 --> 52:22.370]  running form, and that he could
[52:22.370 --> 52:24.050]  train Olympians to run faster.
[52:24.830 --> 52:25.810]  Yeah, he was...
[52:25.810 --> 52:28.390]  He was a big Anderson Silva trainer guy.
[52:28.910 --> 52:29.570]  Hang on.
[52:29.570 --> 52:30.870]  Oh, is this the compilation?
[52:31.590 --> 52:33.110]  Hang on. Hang on.
[52:33.410 --> 52:34.250]  Hang on.
[52:35.330 --> 52:37.750]  Okay, you guys
[52:37.750 --> 52:39.370]  ready? You watching my screen?
[52:39.770 --> 52:41.250]  Yeah. Alright, here we go.
[52:45.090 --> 52:46.050]  What was he
[52:46.050 --> 52:46.610]  doing with it?
[52:47.790 --> 52:49.430]  He almost has a ratty boy
[52:49.430 --> 52:51.230]  like stride. He does.
[52:51.610 --> 52:52.130]  He really does.
[52:52.130 --> 52:55.410]  The top half of his arms are like
[52:55.410 --> 52:57.370]  a different shape from the bottom half somehow.
[52:59.570 --> 53:01.410]  Have you seen that trend where like
[53:01.410 --> 53:03.530]  people try to run same arm, same leg?
[53:03.650 --> 53:05.730]  It looks like he's doing that, but naturally.
[53:06.610 --> 53:07.670]  He's like knocking
[53:07.670 --> 53:09.910]  out everyone he goes...
[53:13.790 --> 53:14.910]  And I feel like
[53:14.910 --> 53:16.950]  I feel like
[53:16.950 --> 53:19.390]  the director's new, and they deliberately
[53:19.390 --> 53:21.270]  always frame him so his arms are like
[53:21.270 --> 53:23.450]  front and center. I've heard
[53:23.450 --> 53:25.410]  a bunch of stories about directors working
[53:25.410 --> 53:27.390]  with Steven Seagal who have absolutely
[53:27.390 --> 53:29.410]  let him make an ass of himself on camera
[53:29.410 --> 53:30.710]  because they hated him so much.
[53:31.090 --> 53:33.230]  Or he was so hard to work with or so insufferable
[53:33.230 --> 53:34.670]  that they're like...
[53:35.240 --> 53:37.190]  Oh man, that's so...
[53:37.190 --> 53:38.790]  Gavin, holy shit.
[53:38.990 --> 53:41.330]  I've only seen above
[53:41.330 --> 53:43.430]  the law, like for those first few clips.
[53:43.810 --> 53:45.430]  I had no idea it was in so many
[53:45.430 --> 53:46.930]  of his movies. That's wonderful.
[53:47.590 --> 53:48.890]  The number one comment is
[53:48.890 --> 53:51.190]  what you're missing here is that he's throwing
[53:51.190 --> 53:53.310]  a recurring series of right hooks. He's not
[53:53.310 --> 53:55.310]  running through the air. He's punching it
[53:55.310 --> 53:57.670]  out of the way so he can run faster.
[53:59.730 --> 54:01.030]  He's getting rid of drag.
[54:04.830 --> 54:06.890]  Are you guys still watching? Are you at the part where he's
[54:06.890 --> 54:09.310]  on the gurney being let out of the hospital
[54:09.310 --> 54:11.070]  with the beard and the... Oh, that's awesome.
[54:13.570 --> 54:15.050]  I want to see more
[54:15.050 --> 54:17.250]  Tommy Lee Jones looks. When I
[54:17.250 --> 54:19.090]  think of weird Tommy Lee Jones, I think of him
[54:19.090 --> 54:20.530]  and the mechanic too.
[54:21.570 --> 54:23.070]  Which is just insane.
[54:23.070 --> 54:24.950]  And I felt like that was his
[54:24.950 --> 54:27.110]  unique, insane role. I think I
[54:27.110 --> 54:29.030]  haven't explored enough of his catalog.
[54:29.550 --> 54:31.150]  I think there's a lot of weird Tommy Lee
[54:31.150 --> 54:33.190]  Jones that I just don't know.
[54:33.850 --> 54:35.230]  He's a great actor.
[54:35.950 --> 54:38.890]  A Jim Carrey interview
[54:38.890 --> 54:41.010]  I was listening to recently on TikTok, where he
[54:41.010 --> 54:43.030]  was telling a story about working with him, I guess probably on
[54:43.030 --> 54:45.130]  Batman. And he went
[54:45.130 --> 54:46.830]  up to him at a...
[54:46.830 --> 54:49.030]  I'm going to butcher the story because I don't remember very well, but
[54:49.030 --> 54:51.050]  he went up to him at a diner or something and he just went
[54:51.050 --> 54:53.010]  to stop and have a conversation with him.
[54:53.270 --> 54:54.530]  I think it was Jim Carrey and
[54:54.990 --> 54:56.970]  Tommy Lee Jones was like, listen, I don't like you.
[54:57.190 --> 54:58.790]  I don't want to talk to you. It was when they were working on Batman.
[54:59.290 --> 55:00.970]  Yeah. And he said,
[55:01.030 --> 55:02.650]  I won't condone your buffoonery.
[55:04.850 --> 55:06.950]  That was their relationship. He's like, okay.
[55:09.090 --> 55:10.990]  He just doesn't... I can't imagine
[55:11.610 --> 55:13.070]  Tommy Lee Jones having like
[55:13.070 --> 55:14.990]  a belly laugh. Like, have it like
[55:14.990 --> 55:16.930]  a deep, genuine laugh.
[55:18.110 --> 55:18.850]  He seems so
[55:18.850 --> 55:20.990]  stoic to me and grumpy all the time,
[55:21.050 --> 55:22.790]  which I know is sort of his thing.
[55:23.010 --> 55:24.250]  It's what he leans into.
[55:25.150 --> 55:26.890]  Benicio Del Toro. Another one.
[55:27.070 --> 55:28.830]  An actor where it's just always
[55:28.830 --> 55:30.950]  great. Big Benicio Del Toro
[55:30.950 --> 55:32.290]  guy. Absolutely.
[55:32.850 --> 55:34.950]  But you could maybe have your
[55:34.950 --> 55:36.970]  opinions changed, Eric,
[55:37.070 --> 55:39.030]  with Twisters coming out this
[55:39.030 --> 55:40.730]  summer. Big release.
[55:41.510 --> 55:42.330]  That movie looks terrible.
[55:43.290 --> 55:44.850]  Oh, it's going to be great.
[55:45.270 --> 55:46.810]  You're nuts. You're fucking crazy.
[55:47.470 --> 55:48.770]  My wife is so
[55:48.770 --> 55:50.770]  fucking excited to see that movie. Really?
[55:51.570 --> 55:52.890]  Why? Just watch Twister.
[55:53.250 --> 55:55.270]  She loved it. She wants to see the new one.
[55:55.730 --> 55:56.990]  It's got Glenn Powell in it.
[55:57.050 --> 55:58.810]  You know how our wives are about
[55:58.810 --> 56:00.010]  Glenn Powell. I know. Yeah.
[56:00.190 --> 56:03.030]  Particularly your wife
[56:03.030 --> 56:05.250]  loves it. Loves Glenn Powell.
[56:05.390 --> 56:06.130]  What are you going to do?
[56:07.810 --> 56:08.690]  I'm incredibly
[56:08.690 --> 56:10.810]  against the use of AI for movies.
[56:10.910 --> 56:12.850]  I feel like it's weird, or just in general, in a lot
[56:12.850 --> 56:14.090]  of ways. It's not great.
[56:14.090 --> 56:16.210]  I think I'd give a pass
[56:16.210 --> 56:18.030]  if they brought back Philip Seymour Hoffman for
[56:18.030 --> 56:19.430]  Twisters, just as an AI.
[56:19.910 --> 56:21.990]  It's dusty. Just having him walking
[56:21.990 --> 56:24.230]  around, yelling about the extreme
[56:24.230 --> 56:26.030]  would make me so happy.
[56:27.690 --> 56:30.010]  It's another actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman
[56:30.010 --> 56:32.070]  is so fucking good. Everything he's
[56:32.070 --> 56:34.090]  in. Have they done that
[56:34.090 --> 56:35.990]  yet? I know they did it
[56:35.990 --> 56:37.950]  on The Sopranos with Tony's mom
[56:37.950 --> 56:40.010]  when she died, before they could record
[56:40.010 --> 56:42.010]  her. And it looked like
[56:42.010 --> 56:44.150]  dog shit because it was 20 years ago. But have they
[56:44.150 --> 56:45.890]  done that recently where they took a
[56:45.890 --> 56:48.130]  deceased person and inserted them into
[56:48.130 --> 56:49.510]  a film? They did Tarkin, didn't they?
[56:49.650 --> 56:52.130]  Yeah, Grandma Tarkin. Great, Grandma Tarkin.
[56:52.170 --> 56:53.790]  That's it. They did it with him?
[56:53.970 --> 56:56.090]  They already did it
[56:56.090 --> 56:57.650]  with Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[56:57.770 --> 56:59.970]  In the last Hunger Games, there's a lot of CG
[56:59.970 --> 57:00.930]  Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[57:01.650 --> 57:03.550]  I wouldn't know anything about that.
[57:04.050 --> 57:06.030]  Didn't they do that with Carrie Fisher
[57:06.030 --> 57:06.750]  after she died?
[57:08.010 --> 57:08.810]  Did they?
[57:08.810 --> 57:10.510]  They did. Isn't she like
[57:10.510 --> 57:12.390]  in space fucking freezing or whatever?
[57:12.610 --> 57:14.590]  Well, she's at the end of Rogue One
[57:14.590 --> 57:16.330]  as CG, I think. Oh, they
[57:16.330 --> 57:18.370]  de-aged her? I don't know if she was already dead.
[57:19.670 --> 57:21.190]  Yeah, I mean there's
[57:21.190 --> 57:22.730]  so much de-aging
[57:22.730 --> 57:25.130]  going on. That I get, but I just like...
[57:25.130 --> 57:26.350]  Grandma Tarkin's a good one.
[57:26.350 --> 57:28.490]  I don't get it. The teeth thing
[57:28.490 --> 57:30.630]  and like forehead wrinkles are fine.
[57:30.770 --> 57:32.870]  I don't understand why we're trying
[57:32.870 --> 57:34.870]  to combat teeth and forehead
[57:34.870 --> 57:36.890]  wrinkles. Let your face scrunch, it's fine.
[57:36.890 --> 57:38.670]  I think it's more like
[57:38.670 --> 57:40.930]  in flashback scenes in Marvel movies
[57:40.930 --> 57:42.810]  when they make like Michael Douglas Young
[57:42.810 --> 57:43.930]  in Ant-Man or something.
[57:44.750 --> 57:46.970]  I feel like it's just such a waste
[57:46.970 --> 57:48.950]  of time. Like in Furiosa, they start
[57:49.630 --> 57:50.870]  to... well, it looked like they were
[57:50.870 --> 57:52.730]  merging the child actor's
[57:52.730 --> 57:54.950]  face with Anya Taylor
[57:54.950 --> 57:56.550]  Joy as
[57:56.550 --> 57:58.930]  time went on to get them to look closer together.
[57:59.210 --> 58:00.970]  But I feel like the whole world has learned
[58:00.970 --> 58:02.890]  to suspend disbelief when it comes
[58:02.890 --> 58:04.690]  to two actresses
[58:04.690 --> 58:06.390]  or actors playing the same character
[58:06.390 --> 58:08.750]  at different times in the same movie. Like, we understand
[58:08.750 --> 58:10.650]  it. They're going to look different, and then it will cut to
[58:10.650 --> 58:12.810]  the next actor. I don't know why we have to merge
[58:12.810 --> 58:14.950]  their heads together. It looks just...
[58:14.950 --> 58:16.230]  It looks way worse!
[58:16.930 --> 58:18.110]  Dude. Distracting.
[58:18.910 --> 58:19.790]  Speaking of
[58:20.550 --> 58:22.690]  a show that... someone that handles that really
[58:22.690 --> 58:24.650]  well. Have you guys ever watched Our Flag Means
[58:24.650 --> 58:26.310]  Death? Yeah. No.
[58:26.870 --> 58:28.950]  There's a character in that show called Jim.
[58:29.150 --> 58:30.730]  It's a woman who's pretending to be
[58:30.730 --> 58:32.570]  a man, and you don't know it at first.
[58:32.570 --> 58:34.790]  So in the first two episodes, the character
[58:34.790 --> 58:36.770]  is played by a dude. And then
[58:36.770 --> 58:38.690]  when they pull the mustache off, it just becomes
[58:38.690 --> 58:40.670]  this woman. And then she's the character for the rest of the time.
[58:40.850 --> 58:42.670]  It's so fucking funny, and I
[58:42.670 --> 58:44.070]  wish more shows would do that.
[58:44.550 --> 58:46.670]  It makes such a
[58:46.670 --> 58:47.810]  point of making it funny.
[58:48.490 --> 58:49.450]  It's delightful.
[58:50.810 --> 58:51.570]  That's awesome.
[58:52.290 --> 58:54.130]  I decided I'm going to write a short story,
[58:55.390 --> 58:56.350]  but exclusively
[58:56.350 --> 58:58.090]  in the signature boxes
[58:58.090 --> 59:00.770]  of iPads at checkouts.
[59:00.770 --> 59:02.450]  I'm going to write it one word at a time.
[59:03.870 --> 59:04.850]  And hope that
[59:04.850 --> 59:06.270]  it ends up somewhere.
[59:07.630 --> 59:08.890]  What? I don't even know
[59:08.890 --> 59:10.810]  what you're talking about. You know when you sign
[59:10.810 --> 59:12.770]  for your credit card or whatever?
[59:13.370 --> 59:14.790]  You want your signing stuff
[59:14.790 --> 59:16.850]  to get, like, hacked? Or how would it end
[59:16.850 --> 59:18.430]  up somewhere? What do you mean by that? Where does all that go?
[59:18.530 --> 59:20.610]  Where does my signature go?
[59:21.730 --> 59:22.750]  I assume to the
[59:22.750 --> 59:23.950]  business and then the bank?
[59:24.530 --> 59:26.890]  So the bank will have
[59:26.890 --> 59:28.870]  my story. I don't know.
[59:29.610 --> 59:30.630]  Are you pitching
[59:30.630 --> 59:32.790]  payday DLC right now? We gotta go rob
[59:32.790 --> 59:34.470]  a bank to get your narrative?
[59:36.450 --> 59:36.970]  And open
[59:36.970 --> 59:38.790]  up all the safety deposit boxes
[59:38.790 --> 59:40.130]  word by word?
[59:42.750 --> 59:44.770]  I wonder how much money and how long it would
[59:44.770 --> 59:46.590]  take for me to finish my story.
[59:47.030 --> 59:47.550]  Well, okay.
[59:48.870 --> 59:50.770]  You have something there. Are you
[59:50.770 --> 59:52.690]  going to write the story ahead of time and then
[59:52.690 --> 59:54.570]  publish it that way? Or are you
[59:54.570 --> 59:56.810]  creating it in the moment as
[59:56.810 --> 59:58.930]  you're checking out? It would suck to have writer's
[59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.630]  block on, like, a fucking Monday
[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.030]  at the grocery store. With about six people
[01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.990]  behind me? Yeah.
[01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:07.010]  I think I could do it on the fly
[01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:08.930]  and just keep a mental
[01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.890]  note of where the
[01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:12.750]  story's going. I think it would be cheating to pre-write
[01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.070]  the story. How many words
[01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.310]  do you think this story will be?
[01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.030]  I mean, how
[01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:20.690]  many pages is a good short story?
[01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.830]  Yeah, 20,000 words, probably.
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:24.170]  For a
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.750]  good short story,
[01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:28.930]  probably at least a thousand words.
[01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.930]  Okay, let's say a thousand words.
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.670]  So I have to buy a thousand
[01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:33.390]  things.
[01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:36.970]  I think the beginning
[01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:37.870]  will be easy, though.
[01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.570]  Once.
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:42.850]  That's my first word going in.
[01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:44.830]  That's how you're going to start it?
[01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.950]  Does the item
[01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:48.610]  in some way have to relate to the word?
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:50.690]  What do you mean?
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.550]  Like, for you to be able
[01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:54.530]  to use a word, does it have to, like, maybe
[01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.350]  be somehow
[01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.450]  incorporated to the product in some way?
[01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:00.710]  Or that you can make the word... Well, no, because then the whole story
[01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.850]  would be about groceries.
[01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:04.670]  What if...
[01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:06.030]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.210]  Maybe this is a separate idea,
[01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.630]  but what if you had to write a short story like
[01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:12.390]  that, but you could only use words
[01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:14.630]  you found in the grocery store on products?
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.510]  And then you had to buy that product.
[01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.250]  So if you wanted to use the word fabulous,
[01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:20.030]  you had to go, like, track down
[01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.070]  something that says fabulous on it and then buy it.
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.150]  You have to buy your
[01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.390]  words for your short story.
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.250]  I think it's a difficult enough handicap as it is
[01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.450]  to be impossible.
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:36.670]  Beans! She exclaimed.
[01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:39.030]  How about this?
[01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:44.210]  How about as a test, we each
[01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:46.330]  buy, like, three items
[01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.130]  and then have to
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.850]  write a story
[01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.430]  based off of words that are on that product.
[01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:54.230]  I like that.
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.210]  I like that.
[01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.270]  So wait, we're buying
[01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.850]  three things and we're putting in three words?
[01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:02.090]  No, well, sure, we could do three words,
[01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.510]  or it could be as long as you want.
[01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.210]  For example, I have an empty bottle of Coke
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.290]  in front of me. Naturally
[01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:10.290]  is on the bottle. I can have natural.
[01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:11.950]  I now have natural in my reserve.
[01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:13.970]  I got flavored. I got cola.
[01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.670]  I got Quebec.
[01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:17.990]  How would you start
[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:19.030]  your story with these words?
[01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.270]  Naturally. Naturally.
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.890]  Naturally, Quebec.
[01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.910]  Yeah, it's like, naturally, Quebec
[01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.270]  is caffeine-free
[01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:32.450]  and provides 17%
[01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:34.090]  of the daily recommended
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:35.990]  niacin, or whatever it is.
[01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.310]  Phosphoric.
[01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:40.550]  Quebec.
[01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:41.030]  Quebec.
[01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:44.470]  Any word on the can
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.850]  or on the product should be fine, right?
[01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:46.710]  Absolutely.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.030]  So they'll have
[01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:52.770]  packaged in Illinois
[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.450]  and then you have the word in right there.
[01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:56.670]  I like the idea
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:58.210]  of buying something and going,
[01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.630]  ooh, the word, I get the word.
[01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.890]  I really wanted a spaghetti subplot
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.550]  and now...
[01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.290]  I love this because
[01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.150]  Gavin had an idea to do this
[01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:12.250]  at checkout and now I can tell by the way
[01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.770]  he's not saying anything,
[01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:16.370]  he's not on board with whatever this new
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:17.630]  idea is. Nah, not at all.
[01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.350]  Not at all, but I feel like we can potentially tackle it
[01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:21.070]  from different angles.
[01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:23.390]  Well, I think they're two different ideas.
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:25.730]  Yeah, but I don't want to...
[01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.090]  I don't want to spot a word I needed
[01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:30.030]  on a can of, like, pickles.
[01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:31.430]  I'm never going to eat the damn things.
[01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.290]  Well, that's up to you. You're the writer.
[01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.330]  Are SpaghettiOs disqualified?
[01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.410]  I guess it has to be
[01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.310]  what's on the can, right? Not what's in
[01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:42.330]  the food.
[01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:44.470]  Because you just unlocked the dictionary.
[01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:47.150]  If the SpaghettiOs spell a word
[01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.510]  on a spoon in a picture on the can,
[01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:50.290]  you get that word.
[01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.410]  This is so specific.
[01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:54.610]  So it just spells, ooooh.
[01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:57.130]  Alright. If that's what it spells,
[01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.930]  you can do... but if it spells yum,
[01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:00.030]  you got yum.
[01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.350]  That's a word. It's on the can.
[01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.290]  I don't want to dissuade you, Gavin,
[01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.410]  from doing your short story idea
[01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.630]  in the signature line
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.330]  because I think that's fun and brilliant
[01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.550]  and I think you should do it.
[01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.630]  I think this is a totally separate idea
[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:18.570]  and I like Andrew's idea of just go to the store,
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.550]  we buy three things that have a lot of words
[01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.350]  on them. Whatever three things. And then just make
[01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.370]  three things that you need. It's up to you to be clever
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.910]  with what to do with the words, right?
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:28.550]  It could even be a thing where we have to guess
[01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:30.410]  what the product is after seeing what
[01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.790]  we create out of the thing.
[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.330]  That's fucking brilliant, dude.
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:35.830]  If you can guess the three items,
[01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:36.990]  dude.
[01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:40.070]  So, let's say I have
[01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:41.650]  a bottle of Coca-Cola, right, Gavin?
[01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.350]  But I don't want you to know it's Coca-Cola,
[01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.690]  so I just use naturally in Quebec
[01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:47.870]  from it. You're never going to necessarily
[01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:49.890]  guess that I sourced that from a bottle
[01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:50.350]  of Coke.
[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:53.850]  So, like, you have to
[01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:55.830]  try to both convey a story
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.590]  or a sentence that is coherent
[01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.070]  while also
[01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.110]  trying to not expose what
[01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:03.090]  your item is, I guess. And then we could reveal
[01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:03.750]  what we bought.
[01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:05.950]  I'll try that too.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.370]  Can everybody have it ready by next week?
[01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:10.150]  For the next episode?
[01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.190]  My hope overall
[01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:15.230]  with the short story and the signature box
[01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.270]  is that if I was to request all my data
[01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.230]  from the bank, I would just
[01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.330]  see, like, hundreds and hundreds
[01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:23.270]  of my signature, and then all of a
[01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:24.670]  sudden, a story starts.
[01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.490]  That would be great. Can you do that?
[01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.990]  Can you request that information from the bank?
[01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.270]  Absolutely no idea.
[01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.470]  I'm not even convinced that goes anywhere.
[01:05:34.090 --> 01:05:35.390]  I'm not convinced that you
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.730]  just write gibberish and then it's gone forever.
[01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.430]  You bring up a great point, Gavin,
[01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:41.410]  where I have never, and maybe this is just
[01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.370]  me being lucky, I've never been in a
[01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.670]  scenario in which I've been asked to verify
[01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:47.490]  any of my signatures ever.
[01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.410]  Completely pointless. I grew up with
[01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:51.230]  pin codes and stuff. Coming here with
[01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:53.410]  signing for stuff that no one ever checks.
[01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.170]  There's nothing even written on the back of my card.
[01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.370]  I don't know what it's for. I don't know who it's for.
[01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:58.890]  Dude, it's the...
[01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:01.250]  It's forms. It's the same thing
[01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.190]  with forms. I went to the doctor this morning and filled out
[01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.230]  the same form I fill out every time I go
[01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:06.830]  there, with the same information,
[01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:09.170]  that then they look at the form and they ask me
[01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:11.090]  the questions on the form, and then I give them
[01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:13.130]  the same information verbally, and then I know
[01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.190]  as soon as I leave, that form gets thrown the fuck away
[01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.990]  because why are they keeping it? It's useless.
[01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:19.010]  It's like when you do a support chat on a website,
[01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.470]  you have to sometimes fill out a brief form
[01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:22.710]  before you can talk to the agent,
[01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:24.870]  and they ask you the same goddamn shit
[01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:25.850]  I just typed! Yeah, never.
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.990]  And you could even say,
[01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:30.730]  I already typed it, and then they go and get it.
[01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:32.050]  It's like, why are you asking me that?
[01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.970]  Yeah. Pissed me off.
[01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.770]  I'm with you. I never
[01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:38.750]  thought about that. Where are my signatures
[01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.590]  going? Who is this helping?
[01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.310]  So Canada still does
[01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:44.630]  signatures too? Uh, for certain
[01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:46.670]  things, yeah. There are times in which I have to sign
[01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.290]  for stuff. Madness.
[01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.730]  It is. Would you consider taking
[01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:52.670]  a photo each time you do it so you could
[01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.850]  have a record yourself?
[01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.590]  Ooh, that's a good idea. Or is that too weird
[01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.850]  to take a photo of a... No, I think
[01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:00.770]  that's fine. I feel fine with that.
[01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.870]  What if this is how Gavin
[01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:04.750]  realized there's fraudulent activity on his
[01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:06.590]  account? I never...
[01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.650]  Listen, I did not have... I didn't write that sentence!
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.670]  Yeah, there was not a leprechaun
[01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:11.330]  in the story.
[01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:13.510]  What?
[01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:16.450]  That was like a two-year period
[01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.690]  when I first moved here, because I was still laughing at the
[01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:20.790]  whole signature thing, where I would just draw a small
[01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.650]  picture of a house every time for my signature.
[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.190]  I drew Whiz Pig one time.
[01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.850]  Here's Whiz Pig.
[01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:29.870]  How long did you spend on that?
[01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:31.530]  It was a little while.
[01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.770]  I thought Whiz Pig would be
[01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.390]  a pretty cool signature for a second,
[01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:40.590]  and then you kinda... When you get
[01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.770]  through like the 13th little line
[01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.790]  that you gotta draw for his head and for his
[01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:46.870]  teeth, you just kinda go, I don't wanna do this anymore.
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:48.770]  I just love the idea
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.710]  of that being stored on some server
[01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.370]  somewhere. On a bank, or a...
[01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:54.850]  Or the servers of the place you
[01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:55.810]  type that.
[01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:58.670]  I think Whiz Pig is somewhere saying like,
[01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.370]  I didn't buy this.
[01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.850]  What? Like they track
[01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:03.910]  him down because it's his face?
[01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.870]  I wish to God,
[01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.250]  now that we're having the discussion,
[01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.730]  I wish it went somewhere, and that
[01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:12.790]  it was findable by someone
[01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:14.830]  someday, but I really don't think so.
[01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:16.890]  I don't think anybody ever
[01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:17.790]  looks at it ever.
[01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:20.830]  Ever. You could admit to
[01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.550]  cr... Dude, you could admit,
[01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:24.670]  Gavin, you could admit to committing
[01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.990]  a murder one word at a time
[01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.670]  on those things, and no one would
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:30.430]  ever catch you, or find out.
[01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:32.870]  Can you
[01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:34.830]  imagine wanting to enter some place, and
[01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:36.790]  them saying, okay, wait a second, we need you
[01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:38.810]  to sign your signature, and they're holding up
[01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:40.750]  one of your old ones to like verify it
[01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.830]  matches? Like what is the value?
[01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:44.810]  It's madness. I'm imagining it like
[01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:46.770]  in the Mr. Bean movie where they hold up
[01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:48.850]  his passport next to his face, and he has to make
[01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.350]  the same face on his passport.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.560]  Oh man, I never thought about
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.680]  signatures in that way.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.560]  I never questioned them.
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.500]  What a pointless system. Yeah.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.620]  Most of the time, when
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.400]  you're filling out anything, or
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.280]  using a pen, or typing stuff in,
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.280]  it's useless.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.600]  I feel like in 2024.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.700]  Like all these things are just designed
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.700]  to slow...
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.380]  just to slow us down.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.800]  Gavin just posted a photo
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.540]  of the Mr. Bean face. That is
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:22.220]  great.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.180]  I might want to use that for the thumbnail.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.240]  You had a lot to pick from.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.020]  I know.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.640]  I think I'm still going with the creepy fucking Ian,
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.580]  but man, there's some good stuff. The creepy Ian
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.040]  is just hideous.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.700]  Maybe we put it to the audience on what to name
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.220]  Ian's evil twin.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.400]  Ian's evil twin!
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.540]  What would be a good name for an evil twin named Ian?
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.140]  You can't do like the backwards name thing.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:52.700]  Tween.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.060]  The audience will come up with something better than we did.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.520]  Oh man.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.060]  What a... oh, I'm excited.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.860]  Hi, I'm Ian, here's my twin
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:04.180]  Tween.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.620]  He's the evil one. You know how it is.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.640]  We have very
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.140]  different signatures, just so you know.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.760]  I want to pitch
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.420]  something to Eric.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.020]  Because I found out
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:18.580]  something about Eric.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.540]  You found out something about Eric?
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.400]  Yeah, that's you by the way.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.500]  I found out
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.620]  that you don't
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:29.700]  like being
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:31.660]  squeezed by the
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.860]  blood pressure inflatables.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.520]  Oh yeah, have I never talked about that?
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.820]  No, I don't think so.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.520]  I don't have a
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.560]  fear of like needles and I'll get
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.500]  like, you know, surgery
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.520]  and like none of that bothers me or
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.460]  whatever. When I get my blood
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.420]  pressure taken, I tell them
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.440]  beforehand. It's the thing where it goes around like your
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.540]  bicep and then it's squeezed
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.320]  to like get your
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.460]  blood pressure.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.300]  Before they do it, I tell them, hey,
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.460]  you're about to get a reading that you're
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:03.100]  going to look at and be like, oh, that's a little high.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.040]  It's not high blood
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.340]  pressure. These things, I hate
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.340]  so desperately
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.860]  and like wish
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.980]  that you never had to do this.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.240]  It makes me so anxious.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.340]  Yes, it makes me so anxious
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]  it makes my heart race.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.220]  I hate them. So I want to pitch to you
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.180]  I get like 10 of them and we
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.220]  put them all over you and inflate
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.240]  them all at the same time. Oh, like immersion
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.020]  therapy. We get like an average
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.580]  reading across all your limbs.
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:32.720]  We're not
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.560]  going to do that. You can keep
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.900]  pitching it as far as you want to.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.520]  Hey, Jeff, we're going to put you in a bucket full of
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.380]  snakes. What are you talking about?
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.540]  Oh, is this
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.940]  like a snake level thing for you?
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.520]  Yeah, I hate it.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:47.820]  I can't
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.500]  look at it while they do it.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.160]  I have to like...
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.460]  I tense up and won't move while it's
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.780]  on me. I hate it. Could you
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.480]  watch it get done to me?
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.780]  Yeah, it doesn't bother me for other people.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.180]  I just know how it makes me feel.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.820]  Yeah, it doesn't matter. I don't give a shit.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.360]  Yeah, let's put 10 on you. I don't care.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.700]  Let's put 10 on you and put you in a bucket of snakes.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.380]  I don't give a shit.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:11.500]  In the interest of never
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.440]  doing a Jeff is scared of snakes
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.240]  bit, I'm
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.620]  full support of you here, Eric. Thank you very much.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.420]  I appreciate that.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.160]  Does that have like a history for you?
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.680]  No, I don't know. It's just a thing
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.480]  I don't like when I can feel
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.020]  my heartbeat in my hand.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:29.280]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.660]  When you can feel your pulse?
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.340]  That means you're alive.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  Yes, and it makes me want to curl up and die.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.600]  So, I don't like it.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.180]  I hate it.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.280]  Okay, what if we put 10 on you?
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.100]  Right? No. They're still loose.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:45.460]  You said alright. We didn't get that far.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.360]  The answer's no.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.100]  At this point, they're just like velcro
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.320]  fabrics. Loose. Nice and loose.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.620]  And then I'll just squeeze
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.160]  one puff of air into each one.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.880]  No.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.500]  I don't understand.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.720]  You said alright
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.960]  and I said no.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.760]  Let's step back for a moment. I still don't know what the
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.960]  goal is for what you're doing.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.700]  I just want to see if his head
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.380]  goes all red.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.680]  You wouldn't need to put 10
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.440]  on me. You could put
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440]  one on me.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.840]  Yeah, you don't need that.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.500]  What if we
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.380]  make a giant slice
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.520]  of bread and Gavin, you can lay on top of it
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.440]  and then slowly lower it into
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.380]  a pool. Like, what are we talking about?
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.760]  Just imagine
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.320]  the bread is like a pool float
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.960]  and you ride it into the water.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.860]  That's not funny, guys.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.300]  What if, like,
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.860]  French loaves were pool noodles?
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.180]  If I was next to Eric
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.700]  watching him get all puffed up
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.360]  and I was slowly getting lowered into a wet bread pool
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.820]  I'd be there for support.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:56.860]  A wet bread pool?
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.160]  That's happening at the same time Geoff is rolling
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.400]  around in a pile of snakes?
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.120]  The snakes are going to kill me.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.260]  Nothing you guys are doing is going to harm you.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.380]  Nick, what are you most scared of that we can exploit?
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.840]  I don't like
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.140]  needles a lot right now. Or blood draws.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:13.540]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.940]  I had a rough blood draw today.
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.260]  You brought some stuff
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.800]  flooding back on that one.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.540]  Sorry about that.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.580]  Wait, hang on.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.940]  How did you learn this about me, Gavin?
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:27.220]  Huh?
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.520]  How did you learn this about me?
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.460]  The most
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.380]  bullshit
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.300]  I've ever heard
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.160]  in my life!
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.240]  Everybody!
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.960]  What the fuck is this?
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:44.100]  Oh my god.
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.040]  Can I?
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.680]  I'm not saying that we should do this.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.440]  Just in my head, it's very funny.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.400]  The idea of all of us
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.860]  sitting in a row
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:55.900]  with our triggers in front of us
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.820]  that seem ridiculous
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.580]  and just fainting and passing out
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.640]  and stressed out.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.920]  Garrett getting his blood pressure done.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.080]  Gavin's puking with wet bread.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.400]  I'm fainting
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.420]  seeing a surgery scene in a movie.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.080]  The most
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.980]  isn't actually impacting us
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.460]  but completely destroying us.
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.460]  I feel like everyone's passing out
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.200]  except I'm just going to be throwing up.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.900]  All that's going to happen to me is I'm going to vomit
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.940]  everything out and then I'll just be hanging there.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:24.600]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.580]  Alright, well,
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.100]  go subscribe to our Patreon while I really get to the
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.220]  bottom of where the fuck Gavin learned this about me.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.340]  What the fuck happened?
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.640]  I can't find out.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.720]  Do you have a lot of stuff, Gavin?
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.360]  Do you have any others?
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.200]  A lot of stuff!
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:41.180]  Can we do one a week?
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.920]  At this point I'm going to keep my source private
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.500]  so I can get
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.860]  more information out of it, potentially.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.320]  Have you been releasing it, Eric,
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.020]  word by word, on
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:52.680]  the signatures?
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:56.080]  When you text Alyssa about Left 4 Dead 2
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.740]  can you just let her know to stop giving her
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.200]  giving you secrets about me? Thank you.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.500]  This sucks.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.940]  I can't believe that.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.160]  It would just be the only person that my wife talks to
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.400]  about this stuff. It's terrible.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.220]  By the way, I was kind of disappointed that we don't really have
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:12.200]  a good URL to push
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.840]  people to other than Patreon
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.620]  slash RegulationPod.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.780]  It's a bit of a mouthful, so I was hoping we had a much
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.760]  shorter URL.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.620]  We don't. Someone else took all those.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:25.000]  So I registered Regulatreon.com.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.000]  You did it.
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.300]  And it forwards to our Patreon.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:29.620]  Wait.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.620]  It's what?
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.200]  Regulatreon.com.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.660]  How do you spell that?
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.600]  The way it sounds, probably.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.360]  R-E-G-U-L-A
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.800]  T-R-I
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.700]  O-N. There it is.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.640]  So go to Regulatreon.com.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.440]  Insane.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.520]  E-O-N.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.000]  Regulatreon.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.680]  Much harder to remember or spell
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.240]  than just go to Patreon.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.780]  But I felt like it was worth it.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.580]  Hey, the link works. It's good.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.160]  Oh, I put it in the show notes
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.900]  so you guys can go scroll down
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.880]  and check out
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.740]  Regulatreon.com.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.080]  With an E.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.140]  Yep. Uh-huh.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.360]  Well, thanks for listening.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:16.380]  Go to Regulatreon.com.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.380]  Go subscribe now.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.860]  Thank you guys so much for listening.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.060]  Check out Regulation Gameplay.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:24.160]  Appreciate you listening.
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.880]  This was episode 7 of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.000]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:28.740]  Bye!
