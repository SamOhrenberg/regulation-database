[00:00.000 --> 00:01.140]  Can we get a cum shirt?
[00:02.020 --> 00:02.320]  No!
[00:05.080 --> 00:06.180]  Who would own that?
[00:06.820 --> 00:12.720]  Now, does it say C-U-M-B but the B looks like it's kind of like scratched out and faded?
[00:13.040 --> 00:13.940]  Like it's silent?
[00:14.040 --> 00:16.500]  I think it's just block letters C-U-M-B.
[00:16.860 --> 00:17.580]  I think it's great.
[00:18.220 --> 00:20.760]  Crazy. What if...
[00:20.760 --> 00:23.160]  The C-U-M is glow in the dark and the B is not.
[00:23.820 --> 00:24.160]  Oh!
[00:25.320 --> 00:26.540]  Glow in the dark cum!
[00:27.940 --> 00:29.980]  But it's not like it reveals...
[00:29.980 --> 00:32.280]  It always said cum, it just said it with a B.
[00:33.840 --> 00:35.680]  Someone said release the cumbler.
