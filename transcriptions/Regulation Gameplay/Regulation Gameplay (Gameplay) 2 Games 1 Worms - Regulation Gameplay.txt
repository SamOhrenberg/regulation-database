[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:01.980 --> 00:05.680]  I'm the classic winner of Worms, so I wanted to introduce this one.
[00:05.820 --> 00:11.360]  Along with me are the losers Geoff, Andrew, and Nick, who lost at Worms.
[00:11.440 --> 00:14.580]  I am the winner of Worms, so, uh, yeah.
[00:14.680 --> 00:15.640]  Yeah, we get it. We know.
[00:16.020 --> 00:17.260]  I feel good about it.
[00:17.520 --> 00:19.740]  Andrew, whatever you turned on and turned off, I'm not even gonna look.
[00:20.000 --> 00:20.700]  I'm just saying yes.
[00:20.780 --> 00:21.900]  I don't care. Let's do it.
[00:21.960 --> 00:23.740]  Me and Geoff just keep hitting the ready up button.
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.960]  We're fucking ready. Let's do it.
[00:25.120 --> 00:26.760]  Welcome to the new frontier of Worms.
[00:26.780 --> 00:27.520]  Let's do this.
[00:27.780 --> 00:29.180]  Welcome to the new frontier of Worms.
[00:32.160 --> 00:33.740]  Ooh, a little standoff.
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.720]  Gonna be a spoon-off.
[00:36.900 --> 00:38.460]  Guy has a hot dog in the top left.
[00:39.980 --> 00:41.960]  That guy has a whole ass pepper in his taco.
[00:42.420 --> 00:42.660]  Yeah.
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.060]  With the stem of it still.
[00:44.720 --> 00:45.760]  I'm gonna eat the stem of the pepper.
[00:46.800 --> 00:47.280]  Hell yeah.
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.360]  Uh, that's not a lot of land.
[00:50.060 --> 00:51.000]  Oh my goodness.
[00:51.920 --> 00:52.440]  Oh boy.
[00:54.340 --> 00:55.040]  Oh, okay.
[00:56.160 --> 00:56.600]  Cool.
[00:56.960 --> 00:59.860]  Oh, Andrew, when you were talking about us having, like,
[00:59.860 --> 01:00.800]  the same...
[01:00.800 --> 01:01.440]  Oh no.
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.120]  Oh boy.
[01:02.220 --> 01:04.600]  Holy shit, what did you turn on?
[01:04.800 --> 01:05.500]  Oh no.
[01:06.020 --> 01:07.040]  Everything I could.
[01:07.460 --> 01:08.660]  Oh my god, Andrew.
[01:09.760 --> 01:10.680]  Oh no.
[01:14.640 --> 01:15.760]  This rocks.
[01:16.220 --> 01:17.960]  This is gonna be the shortest game I've ever played.
[01:18.340 --> 01:19.020]  I love it.
[01:19.180 --> 01:22.180]  Oh my god, what are all these wonderful things?
[01:22.260 --> 01:23.600]  Horrible, wonderful things.
[01:23.960 --> 01:27.320]  Oh my god, I just opened up the weapon menu.
[01:27.480 --> 01:29.480]  Oh my god.
[01:32.380 --> 01:33.460]  Oh my god.
[01:33.460 --> 01:34.260]  Wait, that's my own guy!
[01:34.280 --> 01:34.740]  No!
[01:36.060 --> 01:37.560]  Oh my god.
[01:37.660 --> 01:39.660]  Oh, I killed two of my own people.
[01:39.660 --> 01:40.620]  Tommy goes glug glug.
[01:40.920 --> 01:42.160]  Oh, Wolferine, no!
[01:43.820 --> 01:44.780]  Oh god.
[01:45.460 --> 01:47.260]  I killed my own people twice.
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.140]  All right, regulation worm number, uh...
[01:50.140 --> 01:51.360]  Oh wow, health up, baby.
[01:51.520 --> 01:51.920]  That was good.
[01:52.580 --> 01:53.220]  What is this?
[01:53.460 --> 01:53.600]  Oh boy.
[01:54.720 --> 01:55.680]  What's this?
[01:55.680 --> 01:57.000]  That is so disappointing.
[01:57.180 --> 01:57.480]  Fuck.
[01:57.620 --> 01:58.480]  Dude, this rocks.
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.780]  This is...
[01:59.780 --> 02:01.200]  Andrew, this is crazy.
[02:01.820 --> 02:02.640]  You went fucking...
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.900]  You went feral on this thing, dude.
[02:04.980 --> 02:05.940]  Oh my god.
[02:05.960 --> 02:07.320]  You said you wanted everything.
[02:07.320 --> 02:08.040]  Oh, I love it.
[02:08.240 --> 02:08.800]  I love it.
[02:08.820 --> 02:10.100]  What is this?
[02:12.500 --> 02:13.540]  Oh lord.
[02:14.480 --> 02:14.860]  Uh-oh.
[02:15.580 --> 02:17.420]  What is a demon strike?
[02:18.080 --> 02:18.980]  Oh no.
[02:19.260 --> 02:19.900]  But can you try it on someone else?
[02:19.900 --> 02:21.160]  I bet we're about to find out.
[02:21.500 --> 02:22.440]  Dogfather, run!
[02:22.860 --> 02:22.980]  Just do it with that...
[02:22.980 --> 02:23.380]  That...
[02:23.380 --> 02:25.080]  Yeah, do it with that general area right there.
[02:27.840 --> 02:28.800]  Holy shit.
[02:29.060 --> 02:29.540]  Uh...
[02:29.540 --> 02:29.940]  Oh!
[02:31.780 --> 02:32.620]  Oh my lord.
[02:32.620 --> 02:33.300]  Oh, it burned him.
[02:33.760 --> 02:35.640]  Oh, this is a lot of fire.
[02:35.800 --> 02:35.900]  Oh yeah.
[02:36.160 --> 02:38.180]  A demon strike is just a lot of fire, I guess.
[02:38.180 --> 02:38.540]  Oh, okay.
[02:38.580 --> 02:39.040]  Wow.
[02:39.260 --> 02:39.580]  Damn.
[02:40.440 --> 02:42.800]  That's a cooler name than it is an attack, yeah.
[02:43.060 --> 02:43.320]  Yeah.
[02:46.580 --> 02:50.640]  It was sort of like firing a bottle rocket called Demon's Rage.
[02:50.640 --> 02:50.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.320]  And it's on the branding.
[02:54.220 --> 02:54.680]  Damn.
[02:55.020 --> 02:55.480]  Uh-oh.
[02:58.440 --> 02:58.660]  Uh-oh.
[02:59.560 --> 02:59.960]  Uh...
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.320]  Why not?
[03:00.440 --> 03:00.600]  Wha...
[03:00.600 --> 03:00.840]  No.
[03:01.140 --> 03:01.380]  No.
[03:01.880 --> 03:02.120]  No.
[03:02.540 --> 03:03.140]  No, Eric.
[03:03.260 --> 03:03.540]  No.
[03:04.100 --> 03:04.500]  Okay.
[03:05.440 --> 03:05.520]  Ha!
[03:05.520 --> 03:06.460]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.860]  Not even who I was aiming for.
[03:10.460 --> 03:11.960]  There's a Ming Voss?
[03:12.220 --> 03:12.880]  What do we do with that?
[03:13.020 --> 03:13.420]  Yeah, dude.
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.340]  I'm just like...
[03:14.340 --> 03:15.720]  I'm not even going for like,
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.720]  oh, use the baseball bat.
[03:16.820 --> 03:18.580]  I'm picking Concrete Donkey.
[03:18.780 --> 03:20.340]  I don't know what any of this shit is.
[03:20.860 --> 03:21.840]  Concrete Donkey is awesome.
[03:22.660 --> 03:25.180]  I've never heard of Stuffed Turkey Surprise though.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.360]  Stinking carpet bomb.
[03:27.360 --> 03:29.760]  Two-handed prod, Loozy.
[03:30.180 --> 03:32.120]  What the fuck is this stuff?
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.220]  Oh, I'm so excited. This rocks.
[03:36.560 --> 03:37.600]  This is a good game of worms.
[03:39.060 --> 03:40.000]  What the fuck?
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.080]  Did you just put on a different hat?
[03:42.820 --> 03:43.780]  What is this?
[03:43.960 --> 03:44.700]  Oh, shit!
[03:45.620 --> 03:47.760]  I'm up! I'm up in it!
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.080]  What are you doing?
[03:49.180 --> 03:49.600]  What's happening?
[03:50.880 --> 03:52.160]  Are you party balloon?
[03:53.500 --> 03:54.120]  Where's Doug?
[03:59.780 --> 04:00.300]  Okay.
[04:00.420 --> 04:02.440]  So I guess that just puts you somewhere, huh?
[04:03.440 --> 04:05.220]  Yeah, it's like a lift.
[04:05.640 --> 04:06.020]  Wow.
[04:06.420 --> 04:07.380]  That was kind of disappointing.
[04:08.440 --> 04:10.040]  Alright, Nick, what do you think is here?
[04:11.180 --> 04:12.840]  Well, there's so many options.
[04:14.660 --> 04:16.120]  What is this?
[04:16.540 --> 04:17.840]  A bazooka pie?
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.160]  What are you?
[04:20.160 --> 04:21.840]  It's a bazooka pie.
[04:25.560 --> 04:27.080]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[04:27.180 --> 04:27.740]  That's what happens.
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.240]  A little high.
[04:30.260 --> 04:32.080]  Feed the flash some bazooka pie.
[04:32.280 --> 04:33.260]  Oh my god!
[04:34.080 --> 04:34.860]  Oh, wow.
[04:36.320 --> 04:37.700]  It's burning towards Eric.
[04:38.420 --> 04:39.280]  Okay, we're good.
[04:39.960 --> 04:42.940]  Huh, not quite what I thought it would be.
[04:43.140 --> 04:43.920]  But, you know, still cool.
[04:45.380 --> 04:47.180]  Once again, the branding so far
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.680]  has been better than the device.
[04:49.040 --> 04:49.300]  Yeah.
[04:51.620 --> 04:53.100]  Wow, look at the health.
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.340]  Holy shit.
[04:54.660 --> 04:56.520]  Yeah, no kidding.
[04:58.260 --> 04:58.700]  Alright, Geoff.
[04:59.480 --> 05:00.920]  I'm gonna enter in the drill boat.
[05:01.920 --> 05:02.440]  Oh no.
[05:04.080 --> 05:05.340]  I'm also gonna...
[05:05.340 --> 05:06.480]  Oh right, I can't.
[05:06.980 --> 05:07.200]  No.
[05:08.580 --> 05:10.740]  When the water rises on this one, we're boned.
[05:11.780 --> 05:12.780]  And that's very soon.
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.660]  Oh my god.
[05:16.260 --> 05:17.460]  What a read!
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.520]  Holy shit.
[05:23.820 --> 05:26.120]  Because there was too much land,
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.020]  Geoff decided to take more away.
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.580]  Geoff didn't mean to.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  I was trying to get back up on land,
[05:34.080 --> 05:34.720]  not eat land.
[05:38.430 --> 05:40.190]  Oh, just waiting is fun
[05:40.190 --> 05:41.490]  to be like, what am I gonna deploy?
[05:41.930 --> 05:42.810]  I don't know what this does.
[05:43.250 --> 05:44.930]  Oh my god!
[05:45.410 --> 05:46.470]  What the fuck?
[05:46.550 --> 05:47.990]  That's an angry concrete donkey.
[05:49.370 --> 05:52.170]  Geoff said the concrete donkey was cool!
[05:52.390 --> 05:53.590]  He said it was cool!
[05:54.350 --> 05:56.010]  I said concrete donkey was cool.
[05:56.110 --> 05:57.530]  That's the concrete angry donkey.
[05:57.670 --> 05:58.170]  It's different.
[05:59.770 --> 06:01.010]  It's so much bigger.
[06:01.290 --> 06:02.110]  There was so much death.
[06:04.210 --> 06:05.110]  That was hell on earth.
[06:05.350 --> 06:05.910]  What the fuck happened?
[06:07.150 --> 06:08.430]  Oh my god.
[06:11.190 --> 06:12.770]  Oh my god.
[06:17.430 --> 06:18.270]  Oh, Jesus.
[06:18.870 --> 06:19.290]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[06:19.370 --> 06:20.410]  That was awesome.
[06:21.870 --> 06:23.090]  It's time for Shazam 2.
[06:23.250 --> 06:24.210]  I wanna see what this is.
[06:24.290 --> 06:25.030]  Oh, fuck.
[06:27.450 --> 06:29.170]  What the fuck is this thing?
[06:30.550 --> 06:31.310]  Let's find out.
[06:31.370 --> 06:32.890]  What the fuck?
[06:33.210 --> 06:34.030]  No, no, no, no, no!
[06:34.670 --> 06:35.410]  Beat him up!
[06:35.990 --> 06:37.730]  Oh, that was it?
[06:39.930 --> 06:41.370]  Come on, guys, beat him up!
[06:42.330 --> 06:43.150]  Come on!
[06:43.890 --> 06:45.310]  What is that?
[06:45.490 --> 06:46.610]  Keep doing more fighting!
[06:48.490 --> 06:49.870]  That can't be it!
[06:50.270 --> 06:51.510]  Oh my god!
[06:53.250 --> 06:54.030]  You know what?
[06:54.290 --> 06:55.990]  You don't hire Union henchmen.
[06:56.230 --> 06:57.110]  That's what you get.
[06:57.810 --> 06:59.050]  Yeah, that's a fair point.
[07:01.070 --> 07:02.130]  Let's see what else
[07:02.130 --> 07:03.370]  we have in our little...
[07:03.370 --> 07:04.470]  Let's see what else you got there, huh?
[07:05.450 --> 07:05.930]  Yeah.
[07:09.410 --> 07:09.890]  What?
[07:10.870 --> 07:11.270]  What?
[07:12.290 --> 07:12.690]  Alright.
[07:14.370 --> 07:15.530]  Nope, not yet, not yet.
[07:19.610 --> 07:20.010]  Okay.
[07:21.250 --> 07:23.990]  Here you go.
[07:24.210 --> 07:24.890]  And here you go.
[07:25.130 --> 07:25.810]  And there it is.
[07:25.990 --> 07:28.850]  There, I did it.
[07:29.050 --> 07:29.310]  Nice and easy.
[07:31.470 --> 07:32.270]  Great job.
[07:33.430 --> 07:34.050]  I did it, guys.
[07:35.110 --> 07:36.430]  Where did you go?
[07:36.750 --> 07:37.410]  You got it.
[07:39.390 --> 07:39.890]  Wow!
[07:40.050 --> 07:40.610]  That's it.
[07:40.990 --> 07:43.130]  Back at him, back at him, back at him.
[07:45.110 --> 07:46.110]  Well, well...
[07:46.110 --> 07:46.370]  What?
[07:46.550 --> 07:48.310]  What are you doing, Nick?
[07:49.310 --> 07:51.530]  Well, super flatulent sheep.
[07:51.930 --> 07:54.010]  He's a little inaccurate, turns out.
[07:54.310 --> 07:54.830]  A little.
[07:56.050 --> 07:57.330]  I feel like that could have gone better for you.
[07:57.510 --> 07:59.550]  It could have gone worse, though.
[08:00.130 --> 08:01.650]  I mean, I'm happy with it.
[08:01.910 --> 08:03.130]  I'm feeling good about it.
[08:03.590 --> 08:04.510]  I'll bet you are.
[08:07.410 --> 08:12.950]  I somehow have more worms alive in this game at this stage than I did last game.
[08:13.150 --> 08:13.690]  It's true.
[08:13.850 --> 08:14.810]  I don't know how.
[08:15.090 --> 08:15.350]  No.
[08:16.810 --> 08:20.190]  I think it's because we settled into the weapons, trying to figure them out.
[08:20.310 --> 08:20.890]  That's true.
[08:21.150 --> 08:23.270]  Holy shit! What is that?
[08:23.310 --> 08:24.850]  I didn't pick...
[08:24.850 --> 08:26.310]  I didn't get to pick...
[08:26.310 --> 08:28.910]  I don't know what it's doing.
[08:29.290 --> 08:30.850]  What the fuck is this?
[08:31.110 --> 08:33.090]  I didn't get to aim.
[08:33.670 --> 08:35.050]  I don't know what it's doing.
[08:35.050 --> 08:36.670]  What are you doing?
[08:37.510 --> 08:40.050]  Oh my god.
[08:40.170 --> 08:41.470]  What the fuck?
[08:45.970 --> 08:48.990]  Oh my god!
[08:49.650 --> 08:50.770]  What happened?
[08:51.350 --> 08:52.210]  Geoff!
[08:52.370 --> 08:53.110]  What happened?
[08:54.190 --> 08:54.610]  Geoff!
[08:55.610 --> 08:58.530]  Geoff, what did you do?
[08:59.990 --> 09:01.990]  You killed everything!
[09:02.610 --> 09:03.270]  They're all gone!
[09:04.050 --> 09:05.490]  They're all gone!
[09:05.950 --> 09:07.330]  Geoff, this is what...
[09:07.330 --> 09:08.890]  That's what the Covenant does in Halo.
[09:09.050 --> 09:11.270]  I blast our planet!
[09:11.790 --> 09:12.690]  I got an achievement!
[09:12.950 --> 09:15.810]  The worm that turned killed four worms in a single turn.
[09:16.210 --> 09:17.350]  Oh my god.
[09:17.550 --> 09:18.610]  You're a monster.
[09:19.570 --> 09:22.010]  I'm like, I'm no better than Homelander.
[09:22.410 --> 09:24.050]  Oh my god.
[09:25.430 --> 09:27.090]  What the fuck?
[09:27.090 --> 09:29.990]  I didn't mean to kill so many people.
[09:31.330 --> 09:32.090]  Including myself.
[09:32.630 --> 09:33.530]  Yeah, no kidding.
[09:37.410 --> 09:37.890]  Yeah!
[09:39.950 --> 09:40.430]  Seventeen!
[09:41.590 --> 09:43.270]  Hey, name it's vehicle.
[09:46.230 --> 09:46.710]  Seventeen!
[09:46.730 --> 09:47.450]  Give me that health.
[09:48.470 --> 09:49.710]  I have one worm.
[09:49.830 --> 09:51.870]  I have one worm left.
[09:52.910 --> 09:53.530]  I think we all do.
[09:53.770 --> 09:54.870]  Welcome to Andrew's world.
[09:56.030 --> 09:57.950]  Get it, get it, don't go too far.
[09:58.170 --> 09:59.190]  Do not go too far.
[09:59.490 --> 10:01.870]  Alright, you're good, you're square.
[10:02.410 --> 10:04.070]  Yeah, I'm gonna hide under the sign.
[10:04.150 --> 10:05.550]  We gotta take Geoff out.
[10:06.510 --> 10:08.530]  Listen, I'm taking everybody out.
[10:08.830 --> 10:10.970]  We're gonna do a second game of this on a bigger level.
[10:11.430 --> 10:13.770]  It's over for all of us!
[10:14.690 --> 10:15.130]  Wormageddon!
[10:16.230 --> 10:16.670]  Wormageddon!
[10:17.070 --> 10:17.650]  Oh my god!
[10:18.130 --> 10:21.010]  Oh my god.
[10:22.370 --> 10:25.130]  I swear to god, if I'm the only one that dies from this...
[10:25.130 --> 10:26.190]  You're the only one that died, dude.
[10:26.390 --> 10:27.070]  Oh no!
[10:28.450 --> 10:30.470]  Oh, I think...
[10:30.470 --> 10:32.770]  Oh no, I was gonna say I think Geoff won, but I don't think he did.
[10:33.450 --> 10:33.690]  No!
[10:34.170 --> 10:34.270]  Oh my god.
[10:35.350 --> 10:36.290]  Oh, he landed!
[10:38.490 --> 10:39.450]  Oh no!
[10:39.670 --> 10:40.730]  Oh my god.
[10:42.390 --> 10:43.090]  Yeah, wait.
[10:43.090 --> 10:43.490]  Who?
[10:45.070 --> 10:45.630]  No!
[10:49.730 --> 10:50.650]  Everyone's dead!
[10:51.890 --> 10:52.850]  So did Nick win?
[10:53.310 --> 10:53.810]  No!
[10:53.890 --> 10:54.490]  I don't know.
[10:55.830 --> 10:57.670]  I think it's a draw.
[10:59.150 --> 11:00.560]  I've never seen this.
[11:02.010 --> 11:03.970]  There's such little land left.
[11:05.330 --> 11:06.530]  There's nothing?
[11:07.150 --> 11:08.130]  What happened?
[11:08.310 --> 11:09.810]  The game doesn't know what to do.
[11:12.000 --> 11:12.830]  Is it damage?
[11:15.170 --> 11:16.250]  Did I win?
[11:16.870 --> 11:17.430]  I think I won.
[11:17.590 --> 11:19.750]  You have zero wins, dude.
[11:20.950 --> 11:22.710]  Yeah, I don't think anybody wins.
[11:22.810 --> 11:23.410]  Nobody won.
[11:24.060 --> 11:26.530]  Well, we'll do another one on a bigger level.
[11:27.110 --> 11:29.570]  I mean, I got six kills. I had the best KD.
[11:29.790 --> 11:30.550]  Right, yeah.
[11:30.550 --> 11:33.730]  You had that one weapon that we should not be allowed to use.
[11:34.430 --> 11:34.650]  Yeah.
[11:35.690 --> 11:36.370]  That was pretty cool.
[11:37.450 --> 11:38.890]  That thing was fucking sick.
[11:40.010 --> 11:41.070]  It's doing nice damage.
[11:41.350 --> 11:41.970]  A lot of space.
[11:42.070 --> 11:43.910]  Oh yeah, this is gonna be stupid.
[11:44.390 --> 11:45.110]  Now I'm feeling it.
[11:45.310 --> 11:49.270]  It was a test game. We learned about concrete angry donkeys.
[11:49.830 --> 11:51.870]  Dude, that was awesome.
[11:51.870 --> 11:53.550]  Geoff was like, oh, concrete donkeys, cool.
[11:53.850 --> 11:55.050]  And then it just kept going.
[11:56.850 --> 11:59.610]  I've never seen it that angry before.
[12:02.010 --> 12:02.530]  Alright.
[12:04.290 --> 12:04.990]  Andrew's up.
[12:05.210 --> 12:06.490]  What do I want to do?
[12:07.470 --> 12:10.710]  Well, you got a lot to choose from.
[12:10.870 --> 12:11.570]  Yeah, there's plenty.
[12:12.090 --> 12:12.250]  Ew.
[12:13.350 --> 12:15.870]  So, is there...
[12:15.870 --> 12:17.730]  Are airstrikes not gonna work on this level?
[12:19.130 --> 12:20.010]  I don't know.
[12:20.290 --> 12:20.810]  Good question.
[12:21.070 --> 12:24.110]  Because we're underground and there's like two layers.
[12:25.750 --> 12:26.210]  Interesting.
[12:26.650 --> 12:27.550]  We'll find out.
[12:27.770 --> 12:28.890]  We will find out.
[12:32.310 --> 12:34.230]  Putting a little protection down.
[12:34.390 --> 12:36.770]  Just gonna smartify a little bit.
[12:38.070 --> 12:39.210]  Alright, Nick, how you feeling?
[12:40.290 --> 12:41.070]  Not good.
[12:41.270 --> 12:41.450]  What?
[12:45.250 --> 12:46.390]  Uh, let's see.
[12:46.430 --> 12:48.090]  Wow, there's not a lot of us down here.
[12:49.490 --> 12:50.450]  Well, you're dead.
[12:52.550 --> 12:53.970]  Wait, are we playing on teams?
[12:55.450 --> 12:56.110]  It seems so.
[12:56.170 --> 12:57.150]  Oh, this does look like a team.
[12:57.750 --> 12:59.410]  Me and Andrew are on a team.
[13:00.230 --> 13:03.070]  Nick and, uh, Geoff are on a team.
[13:03.230 --> 13:04.110]  How did that happen?
[13:07.090 --> 13:08.630]  Nothing changed but the level.
[13:08.850 --> 13:10.350]  No, you just changed the level.
[13:10.550 --> 13:11.390]  How weird, I don't know.
[13:12.390 --> 13:13.510]  Alright, Andrew, me and you.
[13:14.950 --> 13:15.890]  It's me and you, Nick.
[13:16.930 --> 13:17.330]  Okay.
[13:21.770 --> 13:25.230]  You know what? You really are on a team with Geoff.
[13:26.650 --> 13:28.890]  We could back out.
[13:29.630 --> 13:31.050]  Yeah, we could absolutely back out.
[13:31.210 --> 13:31.830]  No, we're good.
[13:32.610 --> 13:33.470]  I like how things are.
[13:34.070 --> 13:34.830]  Yeah, I think we're lucky.
[13:36.630 --> 13:37.270]  It's a problem.
[13:37.950 --> 13:40.370]  Okay, what's the issue?
[13:40.410 --> 13:40.830]  We got it, Geoff.
[13:42.310 --> 13:43.590]  No issues at all.
[13:44.710 --> 13:45.270]  Geoff!
[13:45.430 --> 13:46.770]  Some great tag teams right here.
[13:47.250 --> 13:49.650]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[13:50.150 --> 13:52.150]  Why do you have an elevated position?
[13:52.490 --> 13:52.810]  I don't know.
[13:54.370 --> 13:56.290]  Andrew's cheating, so I'm benefiting.
[13:56.550 --> 13:57.270]  Wait, I'm cheating?
[13:58.670 --> 14:00.550]  I'm just thinking out loud, Andrew.
[14:01.330 --> 14:01.950]  Not again.
[14:02.350 --> 14:04.410]  I didn't even know I was cheating.
[14:04.890 --> 14:05.370]  Yes, I am.
[14:06.410 --> 14:07.350]  You're my teammate.
[14:07.670 --> 14:09.090]  Yeah, exactly.
[14:11.230 --> 14:12.230]  What is this?
[14:12.230 --> 14:13.210]  What are you cheating?
[14:13.670 --> 14:16.250]  Oh, wow.
[14:25.010 --> 14:26.970]  When you open up your inventory...
[14:28.010 --> 14:29.050]  Am I the only one bothered
[14:29.050 --> 14:30.650]  by the sheep on a rope logo?
[14:31.130 --> 14:33.350]  No, I don't know what rope sheep is.
[14:34.190 --> 14:35.270]  It looks like it's on a noose.
[14:35.290 --> 14:35.690]  Rope sheep crazy.
[14:37.030 --> 14:38.550]  Agile old lady crazy.
[14:38.790 --> 14:39.670]  There's a lot happening.
[14:40.150 --> 14:43.350]  I just opened it.
[14:43.410 --> 14:44.130]  What the fuck is this?
[14:44.190 --> 14:44.830]  Oh my god!
[14:45.090 --> 14:46.470]  What the fuck?
[14:48.310 --> 14:48.670]  What was that?
[14:49.370 --> 14:53.530]  I got super uppercutted.
[14:56.650 --> 14:57.610]  Alright, Andrew.
[14:58.410 --> 14:59.490]  It's time to lock in.
[14:59.770 --> 15:01.130]  Knock some of these fuckers down.
[15:02.010 --> 15:04.110]  Unfortunately, it's just us, largely.
[15:05.070 --> 15:05.790]  No, no, no.
[15:05.910 --> 15:06.770]  Look at that.
[15:07.270 --> 15:08.890]  Regulation worms all at the top.
[15:08.990 --> 15:09.330]  Look at that.
[15:10.930 --> 15:13.590]  Will the turret shoot at me?
[15:14.890 --> 15:17.130]  Will the turret attack me?
[15:17.470 --> 15:17.550]  Yes.
[15:18.670 --> 15:19.310]  No.
[15:21.950 --> 15:22.990]  We'll find out.
[15:23.950 --> 15:24.590]  Wow.
[15:25.630 --> 15:26.670]  Here we go.
[15:27.050 --> 15:27.970]  Here we go.
[15:28.310 --> 15:29.790]  I'm gonna devastate you.
[15:30.130 --> 15:32.490]  I'm gonna devastate you with a little poke
[15:32.490 --> 15:33.890]  into my turret.
[15:33.890 --> 15:34.870]  Oh, hell yeah.
[15:36.670 --> 15:37.230]  Ha!
[15:39.070 --> 15:39.630]  Ha!
[15:39.870 --> 15:40.270]  Die!
[15:42.790 --> 15:44.290]  Oh my god.
[15:45.570 --> 15:46.070]  30?
[15:46.650 --> 15:47.630]  It was 30?
[15:48.190 --> 15:49.210]  It was even less than I thought.
[15:50.710 --> 15:52.310]  Yeah, I thought he'd be dead for sure.
[15:52.330 --> 15:52.650]  Fuck that.
[15:54.510 --> 15:56.690]  Eric, we gotta cheat more next time.
[15:56.970 --> 15:57.630]  We gotta double the cheating.
[15:57.630 --> 15:58.250]  No kidding.
[15:58.810 --> 16:00.810]  We gotta lock in on this cheating, dude.
[16:01.210 --> 16:02.050]  Oh my god.
[16:02.450 --> 16:05.850]  My favorite thing watching this game.
[16:06.490 --> 16:07.550]  Watching Nick jump.
[16:09.470 --> 16:10.730]  It's hard, dude.
[16:11.750 --> 16:12.250]  There we go.
[16:12.870 --> 16:14.390]  Nick, now that we're on the same team,
[16:15.030 --> 16:16.670]  if you wanna jump high,
[16:16.850 --> 16:18.930]  you have to jump backwards into something
[16:18.930 --> 16:19.670]  and double jump.
[16:22.110 --> 16:23.150]  It's a little tricky,
[16:23.310 --> 16:24.970]  but it works way better than trying to jump forward.
[16:26.950 --> 16:28.830]  Looking at the port-a-potty next to Nick.
[16:28.830 --> 16:31.170]  What is gonna happen to the pink port-a-potty?
[16:31.430 --> 16:31.990]  Do we know?
[16:32.710 --> 16:35.230]  We got that.
[16:35.450 --> 16:38.810]  If we weren't, I was gonna suggest
[16:38.810 --> 16:41.410]  we put an air tag on it and see where it goes.
[16:42.210 --> 16:43.070]  No way!
[16:43.430 --> 16:44.250]  Did that work?
[16:46.630 --> 16:47.090]  Six.
[16:47.230 --> 16:47.810]  No, it didn't.
[16:49.010 --> 16:50.250]  Wow, that's some bullshit.
[16:52.490 --> 16:53.110]  Alright, here we go.
[16:53.650 --> 16:54.230]  I feel good.
[16:55.470 --> 16:56.590]  Alright, here we go.
[16:57.190 --> 16:57.850]  Here we go.
[16:57.890 --> 17:00.330]  I gotta think about how we're doing this thing.
[17:05.330 --> 17:13.520]  Run, Geoff, run!
[17:14.020 --> 17:15.380]  You should have evaluated more.
[17:16.540 --> 17:17.680]  Oh my god.
[17:21.300 --> 17:23.780]  Now, if it helps, I did three damage.
[17:24.040 --> 17:26.180]  The five that we both took is from being sick.
[17:27.820 --> 17:28.740]  Oh, I moved.
[17:29.200 --> 17:30.080]  Shouldn't have done that.
[17:30.980 --> 17:31.840]  Shouldn't have moved.
[17:33.460 --> 17:34.360]  Shouldn't have done that.
[17:35.400 --> 17:36.320]  That's the end of my turn.
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.260]  I'm gonna go back to sleep.
[17:39.540 --> 17:40.340]  Wake me up in three turns.
[17:44.120 --> 17:45.260]  Alright, break a leg, Batgirl.
[17:47.140 --> 17:49.000]  We have, now, I don't know if you've seen
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.340]  top left, teeny tiny Tony over there
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.720]  or whatever, there's just like a lot happening.
[17:53.140 --> 17:55.180]  Oh my god, what the fuck?
[17:55.180 --> 17:57.680]  I don't know. I don't know what it does.
[17:57.840 --> 17:58.380]  What is that?
[17:59.120 --> 18:00.620]  Oh, I can control it!
[18:00.820 --> 18:01.320]  Oh no!
[18:03.200 --> 18:09.470]  Wait, I still have my turn.
[18:10.010 --> 18:11.150]  Oh yeah, go!
[18:13.070 --> 18:14.210]  Plenty to do!
[18:16.830 --> 18:18.450]  Fortify the hotel more!
[18:19.590 --> 18:19.950]  What?
[18:21.190 --> 18:22.790]  It's my home.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.270]  I live here.
[18:24.990 --> 18:26.030]  How do I?
[18:26.970 --> 18:27.430]  No!
[18:27.710 --> 18:27.910]  Ah!
[18:30.310 --> 18:31.650]  I did nothing!
[18:33.390 --> 18:34.250]  Way to go, dude.
[18:34.790 --> 18:35.330]  Way to go, man.
[18:36.890 --> 18:38.750]  South Park is hurting down there.
[18:38.790 --> 18:39.130]  He is.
[18:39.230 --> 18:41.550]  And then we got fucking teeny tiny Tony.
[18:45.100 --> 18:45.700]  Alright, here we go.
[18:45.780 --> 18:47.740]  Oh, he's chest bumping.
[18:47.960 --> 18:48.820]  There you go.
[18:50.620 --> 18:52.920]  This would be a great opportunity
[18:52.920 --> 18:54.220]  to face the other way
[18:54.220 --> 18:55.660]  and double jump backwards.
[18:55.900 --> 18:59.020]  Okay, I understand what you're saying now.
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.700]  Yeah, this would be even better.
[19:00.700 --> 19:01.920]  This would also be another opportunity.
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.280]  Now you're down here with me.
[19:07.540 --> 19:07.940]  No!
[19:09.940 --> 19:10.780]  You're welcome, Geoff.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.620]  Thank you.
[19:13.820 --> 19:14.720]  Oh, jeez.
[19:14.940 --> 19:15.160]  Okay.
[19:16.360 --> 19:17.240]  Oh, jeez.
[19:17.760 --> 19:18.320]  Oh, dang.
[19:20.340 --> 19:21.220]  Oh, shucks.
[19:22.060 --> 19:23.880]  Sign fetch time, baby.
[19:24.440 --> 19:26.320]  Get some revenge, Eric.
[19:27.220 --> 19:27.800]  Nope, wrong way.
[19:27.860 --> 19:28.200]  Here we go.
[19:28.660 --> 19:31.260]  See, that's not so easy.
[19:31.680 --> 19:32.260]  No, you know what?
[19:33.420 --> 19:35.600]  I got an idea.
[19:35.840 --> 19:36.420]  Here's the thing.
[19:38.960 --> 19:39.920]  We have...
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.820]  I got an idea. Here's the thing.
[19:42.220 --> 19:43.440]  And here it comes.
[19:43.740 --> 19:44.520]  And there it goes.
[19:45.460 --> 19:47.360]  What we do is...
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.820]  Hang on.
[19:50.420 --> 19:52.440]  Hang on. Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
[19:52.760 --> 19:53.180]  Hang on.
[19:53.740 --> 19:54.800]  We're hanging, dude.
[19:56.020 --> 19:56.700]  It's good.
[19:58.020 --> 19:58.860]  Hang on.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.640]  Okay, so here's...
[20:01.640 --> 20:02.880]  What happened is I...
[20:03.860 --> 20:06.080]  I spent a lot of time looking for something.
[20:06.240 --> 20:07.180]  Alright, so...
[20:07.180 --> 20:09.460]  We suck.
[20:10.060 --> 20:10.980]  We're terrible.
[20:12.820 --> 20:13.540]  Let's go.
[20:13.720 --> 20:15.120]  Now you know what it's like to be me.
[20:16.420 --> 20:16.780]  Hmm.
[20:21.880 --> 20:23.960]  I was looking for Bunker Busters
[20:23.960 --> 20:25.580]  because I wanted to see if they would come in
[20:25.580 --> 20:26.660]  but I don't think they're...
[20:26.660 --> 20:28.780]  I think they're just not on this level at all.
[20:30.000 --> 20:30.520]  Oh, are they not?
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.220]  No. That's what I was looking for.
[20:32.300 --> 20:34.780]  I'm like, okay, cool. This will be a good time to try it out.
[20:35.480 --> 20:36.240]  Oh, you're right.
[20:36.760 --> 20:37.340]  You can't.
[20:38.700 --> 20:39.580]  Great job, Geoff.
[20:39.720 --> 20:40.360]  Great job, Geoff.
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.800]  See, me and Geoff effectively did the same thing.
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.860]  My house!
[20:47.600 --> 20:48.100]  No!
[20:49.840 --> 20:50.700]  Alright, here we go.
[20:52.900 --> 20:54.180]  There's one mine.
[20:54.380 --> 20:55.120]  That sucks.
[20:55.800 --> 20:56.620]  Jesus Christ.
[20:59.140 --> 21:00.260]  Take notes, Nick.
[21:00.620 --> 21:01.520]  Take notes, Nick.
[21:01.640 --> 21:02.460]  Look at this jumping.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.260]  Take notes!
[21:06.620 --> 21:07.220]  Take...
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.180]  Take notes!
[21:08.180 --> 21:08.220]  Take notes!
[21:10.200 --> 21:11.700]  Get that notepad out!
[21:12.400 --> 21:13.080]  Oh, wow, okay.
[21:15.620 --> 21:18.540]  Okay, alright, I see it now.
[21:18.620 --> 21:19.020]  I got it.
[21:19.140 --> 21:19.620]  I'm moving in.
[21:23.160 --> 21:24.460]  Are you going to the house?
[21:24.560 --> 21:25.100]  How's it going?
[21:25.320 --> 21:26.180]  How's it going down here?
[21:27.980 --> 21:28.840]  How's it going?
[21:29.720 --> 21:32.100]  Imagine if someone were to give you a little...
[21:32.940 --> 21:33.340]  Ah!
[21:35.000 --> 21:35.860]  He got shot!
[21:35.860 --> 21:36.100]  Oh, shit!
[21:45.320 --> 21:46.760]  Alright, here we go.
[21:46.960 --> 21:47.540]  Here comes Nick.
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.540]  Nice! Way to go, dude.
[21:50.660 --> 21:53.280]  Okay, but...
[21:53.280 --> 21:54.040]  What the?
[21:55.400 --> 21:55.780]  What?
[21:57.560 --> 21:58.940]  Oh, okay, I see.
[22:00.180 --> 22:00.700]  Alright.
[22:02.560 --> 22:03.680]  Nick and I are killing it.
[22:03.680 --> 22:05.460]  Well, my...
[22:05.460 --> 22:08.360]  Yeah, my, uh...
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.580]  Between Nick falling and me not going,
[22:10.820 --> 22:11.700]  we're, uh...
[22:13.620 --> 22:15.540]  Did that shoot him or not?
[22:15.760 --> 22:16.740]  Did he take any damage?
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.320]  He took 20!
[22:19.580 --> 22:21.720]  I shot him in the face!
[22:22.380 --> 22:23.980]  With a triple barrel shotgun!
[22:24.480 --> 22:25.520]  In the face!
[22:29.040 --> 22:30.280]  Oh, my God!
[22:30.560 --> 22:31.600]  You should have poked him.
[22:31.600 --> 22:32.780]  This gun wonders for me.
[22:33.080 --> 22:36.240]  I don't have a century gun set up.
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.660]  Is that a potato?
[22:41.120 --> 22:41.700]  What is that?
[22:43.920 --> 22:45.780]  Oh, it's turkey surprise!
[22:46.180 --> 22:47.440]  It's turkey surprise!
[22:48.560 --> 22:49.420]  Run, wolverine!
[22:52.480 --> 22:53.600]  That's a lot of fire!
[22:54.140 --> 22:55.860]  I took you down to hell with me.
[22:59.980 --> 23:00.440]  Oh!
[23:00.700 --> 23:01.460]  Kill me!
[23:02.960 --> 23:03.380]  I'm trying.
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.040]  Did we get him?
[23:04.980 --> 23:05.900]  Come on!
[23:06.700 --> 23:08.200]  I got baby health.
[23:12.920 --> 23:14.500]  Andrew, you gotta focus on
[23:14.500 --> 23:16.640]  teeny tiny Tony over there on the left, I think.
[23:16.800 --> 23:17.900]  I'm gonna go kill that baby.
[23:19.320 --> 23:21.040]  I'm gonna go get revenge for you, Eric.
[23:22.020 --> 23:22.900]  Thanks, bud.
[23:23.340 --> 23:24.720]  You just left your fortress.
[23:24.720 --> 23:26.300]  Yeah, well, you're ruining it.
[23:27.440 --> 23:29.780]  Resell value is diminished greatly.
[23:30.040 --> 23:32.420]  What the fuck are you about to use?
[23:33.660 --> 23:35.360]  Enjoy cranberry sauce
[23:35.360 --> 23:36.460]  in hell, you fuck!
[23:38.940 --> 23:39.620]  Get out of there!
[23:39.740 --> 23:40.500]  I'm trying!
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.320]  Andrew!
[23:42.860 --> 23:43.100]  No!
[23:45.440 --> 23:47.320]  Why are you down here now?
[23:49.880 --> 23:51.560]  Oh, and you hurt Batgirl!
[23:51.880 --> 23:52.700]  This is a mess.
[23:54.420 --> 23:55.360]  Oh, no!
[23:56.480 --> 23:57.800]  Oh, you got that one.
[23:58.160 --> 23:58.660]  Got me.
[23:59.400 --> 24:00.280]  Oh, my God.
[24:00.440 --> 24:02.140]  Did you take yourself out? No.
[24:02.440 --> 24:03.440]  Oh, my God.
[24:05.100 --> 24:06.600]  I just didn't like you, turkey.
[24:07.160 --> 24:08.620]  I had to get revenge.
[24:08.980 --> 24:10.340]  Thanks, man.
[24:10.500 --> 24:11.640]  Oh, no, you're so dead.
[24:13.340 --> 24:15.280]  That sick worm with 1% health
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.460]  has been me for a month.
[24:16.940 --> 24:17.580]  That's my life.
[24:19.280 --> 24:20.800]  That's just how I've been existing.
[24:23.360 --> 24:24.340]  Oh, man.
[24:26.080 --> 24:26.920]  There we go.
[24:27.300 --> 24:28.320]  Fucked up.
[24:29.720 --> 24:30.680]  Dumbass South Park.
[24:30.700 --> 24:31.960]  Go to sleep, worm.
[24:35.080 --> 24:35.880]  Sleep forever.
[24:42.300 --> 24:42.920]  Let's see.
[24:43.100 --> 24:44.060]  What you gonna do?
[24:45.520 --> 24:46.860]  That's where I think about it, you know what I mean?
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.500]  You gotta think about it.
[24:49.800 --> 24:51.760]  Dude, if you're not thinking about it,
[24:51.760 --> 24:53.320]  what are you doing? You know what I mean?
[24:53.900 --> 24:54.720]  He ain't living.
[25:03.090 --> 25:03.670]  Okay.
[25:08.830 --> 25:10.370]  I like where your head's at.
[25:10.930 --> 25:11.810]  What happened?
[25:13.750 --> 25:16.030]  It's a homing missile.
[25:16.170 --> 25:16.850]  What did you hit?
[25:17.650 --> 25:20.110]  It didn't home on anything.
[25:20.510 --> 25:21.650]  I thought you hit one of mine.
[25:21.650 --> 25:22.810]  I hit nothing.
[25:22.810 --> 25:25.190]  It's a homing missile.
[25:25.310 --> 25:26.570]  Well, it takes a little while to ignite.
[25:30.330 --> 25:31.490]  Alright, Geoff.
[25:31.790 --> 25:33.210]  What the fuck?
[25:36.790 --> 25:38.610]  Are you karate-kidding it?
[25:40.010 --> 25:41.350]  Putting the bandana on?
[25:43.050 --> 25:44.290]  Look at that. What a job.
[25:44.290 --> 25:45.110]  No, Geoff.
[25:45.230 --> 25:46.030]  Yeah, Geoff.
[25:48.170 --> 25:49.750]  That's fine. Being over here is fine.
[25:51.390 --> 25:52.170]  For safety?
[25:55.250 --> 25:55.690]  Alright.
[25:55.830 --> 25:57.770]  Now, let's see how you like the homing missile.
[25:58.890 --> 25:59.490]  Oh, no.
[25:59.770 --> 26:01.370]  Let's see how I like the homing missile.
[26:01.530 --> 26:02.850]  He's got a better angle for it.
[26:03.210 --> 26:04.250]  He's up there.
[26:05.710 --> 26:07.310]  I was gonna say, be quiet, Nick.
[26:07.450 --> 26:08.870]  That is your job as his teammate.
[26:09.290 --> 26:10.610]  I can't get mad at that.
[26:14.490 --> 26:14.930]  Geoff!
[26:15.030 --> 26:16.370]  I didn't give it enough beans!
[26:16.370 --> 26:17.470]  Geoff!
[26:17.890 --> 26:19.010]  I told you!
[26:19.330 --> 26:21.110]  I should've given it more beans!
[26:21.790 --> 26:23.650]  It doesn't home!
[26:24.810 --> 26:26.230]  There's no home!
[26:27.250 --> 26:28.430]  It does if you...
[26:28.430 --> 26:29.690]  I think if you give it enough time.
[26:29.790 --> 26:30.710]  Speaking of homes...
[26:31.330 --> 26:34.250]  Let me back in my home!
[26:35.170 --> 26:36.330]  I just wanna be safe.
[26:38.470 --> 26:40.310]  These motherfuckers keep destroying my walls.
[26:40.310 --> 26:41.330]  Okay, so now...
[26:41.330 --> 26:43.210]  Look over to the left.
[26:43.210 --> 26:44.350]  Oh, you're not even gonna go for it.
[26:44.350 --> 26:45.870]  No, I'm rebuilding my home!
[26:49.330 --> 26:51.030]  I feel a lot safer.
[26:52.550 --> 26:52.850]  Good.
[26:53.050 --> 26:53.410]  Oh, cool.
[26:54.650 --> 26:56.890]  That's all we really care about.
[26:57.170 --> 26:58.990]  Yeah, glad to hear it.
[27:00.870 --> 27:01.950]  Someone's gotta live.
[27:02.770 --> 27:04.990]  You guys are just shooting homing missiles at nothing.
[27:05.130 --> 27:06.510]  I need to lock down somewhere.
[27:09.030 --> 27:10.870]  Oh, take three.
[27:11.530 --> 27:12.910]  Will this one land?
[27:13.170 --> 27:13.470]  Let's see.
[27:21.230 --> 27:22.490]  Too many be...
[27:22.490 --> 27:25.510]  See? It's a homing missile that doesn't home.
[27:25.650 --> 27:26.410]  I'm telling you.
[27:26.470 --> 27:27.850]  And you guys are saying like,
[27:27.910 --> 27:29.030]  Oh, it's ridiculous you're hiding.
[27:29.390 --> 27:31.330]  Y'all are shooting at things you're not meaning to.
[27:31.470 --> 27:33.270]  I need to lock down somewhere.
[27:34.190 --> 27:35.250]  Now that's true.
[27:36.170 --> 27:37.550]  There is that.
[27:41.290 --> 27:42.310]  Go up!
[27:42.890 --> 27:43.470]  Go up!
[27:43.830 --> 27:44.910]  Go up!
[27:45.370 --> 27:46.070]  You're already burnt.
[27:46.390 --> 27:48.830]  He didn't go up!
[27:52.070 --> 27:53.370]  I know how you feel.
[27:53.770 --> 27:55.190]  He didn't go up!
[27:56.010 --> 27:57.090]  I know how you feel.
[27:57.270 --> 27:58.450]  He just didn't go up.
[27:58.470 --> 27:59.630]  Harpoon the ceiling.
[28:00.530 --> 28:00.650]  No!
[28:02.490 --> 28:03.590]  Harpoon the ceiling.
[28:04.770 --> 28:06.370]  There you go.
[28:06.370 --> 28:07.950]  He's not going.
[28:08.090 --> 28:09.330]  He doesn't go.
[28:09.350 --> 28:10.210]  Is it my turn?
[28:11.650 --> 28:14.470]  He got stuck on this skull.
[28:15.810 --> 28:16.110]  Oh, okay.
[28:16.270 --> 28:19.010]  I was just looking at options.
[28:19.470 --> 28:19.670]  Go, Eric!
[28:20.590 --> 28:21.490]  I just...
[28:21.490 --> 28:22.450]  What the fuck?
[28:24.690 --> 28:25.850]  I hate you, sign fetch!
[28:27.650 --> 28:28.690]  What the...
[28:28.690 --> 28:30.450]  Is that a car?
[28:31.270 --> 28:33.090]  Is that from Golf?
[28:33.090 --> 28:34.330]  Toy Story.
[28:34.390 --> 28:36.410]  It is. It does look like the golf cart.
[28:36.470 --> 28:37.110]  Oh, shit.
[28:39.150 --> 28:39.590]  Alright, Geoff.
[28:39.670 --> 28:41.870]  This is gonna be fun.
[28:41.990 --> 28:45.450]  What did you do?
[28:45.690 --> 28:47.190]  My house!
[28:49.710 --> 28:52.210]  I just repaired the other side.
[28:53.470 --> 28:54.210]  Oh, my God.
[28:55.390 --> 28:55.910]  No!
[28:55.910 --> 28:56.130]  No!
[29:00.990 --> 29:02.610]  Oh, my God.
[29:03.190 --> 29:03.810]  Holy mother.
[29:04.430 --> 29:07.130]  I knew I was gonna die doing it, but it felt worth it.
[29:07.510 --> 29:08.250]  You know what?
[29:08.950 --> 29:09.470]  It was.
[29:11.970 --> 29:13.870]  Geoff blew me out of my house.
[29:14.870 --> 29:15.210]  Alright.
[29:15.790 --> 29:17.850]  Alright, we gotta make something happen here, Andrew.
[29:18.370 --> 29:20.110]  Yeah, repairing my house
[29:20.110 --> 29:21.130]  is what's gotta happen.
[29:21.490 --> 29:21.630]  No.
[29:21.630 --> 29:23.650]  There's no house repair.
[29:23.830 --> 29:24.950]  What are you talking about?
[29:25.450 --> 29:27.730]  We have to kill the other worms!
[29:28.130 --> 29:29.410]  We have to kill the other worms!
[29:29.750 --> 29:31.430]  I'm worried about the future, okay?
[29:31.470 --> 29:32.750]  I gotta resell this home.
[29:33.830 --> 29:35.710]  I gotta move to a cheaper area.
[29:37.810 --> 29:38.510]  Is it different?
[29:38.870 --> 29:40.370]  It's got all these plumbing issues.
[29:40.730 --> 29:42.690]  I'm moving back to Worms 2, okay?
[29:43.170 --> 29:45.010]  I can't keep living here.
[29:45.190 --> 29:46.550]  Oh, it's me! It's my turn?
[29:46.750 --> 29:47.770]  I didn't know it was my turn!
[29:47.770 --> 29:50.490]  Yes! That's what I was fucking yelling at you about!
[29:50.610 --> 29:52.050]  What are you talking about?
[29:52.410 --> 29:54.150]  What are you fucking talking about?
[29:54.150 --> 29:55.190]  No! What are you doing?
[29:55.290 --> 29:55.950]  Are you kidding me?
[29:56.390 --> 29:59.290]  What do you think we were doing?
[29:59.450 --> 30:00.630]  I thought it was your turn.
[30:01.350 --> 30:03.030]  What are you, fucking Gavin?
[30:03.350 --> 30:04.170]  Are you serious?
[30:04.310 --> 30:07.610]  My name's Andrew, and I'm not from Britain, and I don't like Katy Perry's feet.
[30:09.110 --> 30:09.670]  I'm very different.
[30:09.670 --> 30:10.730]  What do you have against Katy Perry's feet?
[30:10.730 --> 30:13.050]  I don't have any feelings towards them.
[30:13.970 --> 30:15.730]  Dude, Legolas is gonna fuck you up.
[30:20.920 --> 30:21.760]  Whose turn is it?
[30:21.920 --> 30:22.140]  See?
[30:22.720 --> 30:23.280]  It's Nick.
[30:23.860 --> 30:26.740]  No, it's Nick. It's easy to understand when you pay attention.
[30:26.960 --> 30:29.420]  I wasn't paying attention. I was just looking at the wrong...
[30:30.280 --> 30:31.340]  Nick, you better stay...
[30:31.340 --> 30:32.120]  Oh, okay.
[30:32.220 --> 30:34.120]  You better be attracted to that Rocket League car.
[30:35.140 --> 30:36.640]  That better be what's going on here.
[30:37.720 --> 30:39.320]  Don't forget that I'm down there, too.
[30:40.000 --> 30:40.940]  Oh, I know, I know. I got you.
[30:41.040 --> 30:41.680]  76 health.
[30:42.020 --> 30:43.600]  Oh, he's gonna get you, alright.
[30:44.040 --> 30:45.240]  He's got you, alright.
[30:46.140 --> 30:46.660]  Shocker!
[30:48.040 --> 30:49.300]  I mean, just...
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.300]  What was the plan?
[30:52.220 --> 30:52.740]  Um...
[30:52.740 --> 30:55.140]  I expected that to go mildly higher.
[30:55.440 --> 30:57.760]  Nick rode his bike to my house
[30:57.760 --> 30:59.020]  with a carton of eggs
[30:59.020 --> 31:01.860]  and then fell on the carton on my front doorstep.
[31:02.060 --> 31:02.160]  Right.
[31:03.080 --> 31:03.780]  He didn't die.
[31:05.200 --> 31:07.120]  And then rather than come in,
[31:07.140 --> 31:07.860]  I just went home.
[31:08.200 --> 31:11.060]  It was more like he rolled up with a carton of eggs
[31:11.060 --> 31:12.260]  and then realized they were boiled.
[31:12.260 --> 31:12.560]  Ha!
[31:14.760 --> 31:16.020]  Like, oh no!
[31:16.440 --> 31:18.400]  Well, we'll have to
[31:18.400 --> 31:19.120]  bake another day.
[31:19.340 --> 31:22.040]  Okay, I feel good about this now.
[31:23.960 --> 31:24.560]  Alright.
[31:24.860 --> 31:25.500]  Dodge this.
[31:26.460 --> 31:27.780]  God fucking damn it.
[31:29.120 --> 31:29.920]  What's worse?
[31:30.220 --> 31:31.880]  I hate, I hate, I hate,
[31:31.900 --> 31:33.720]  I hate it so much.
[31:34.040 --> 31:36.480]  I hate this, I hate it so much.
[31:36.660 --> 31:38.140]  Why does it not home?
[31:38.560 --> 31:39.920]  That was so
[31:39.920 --> 31:40.840]  satisfying.
[31:46.700 --> 31:48.100]  What the fuck?
[31:48.340 --> 31:50.620]  What's this Rocket League ass car? What is this?
[31:52.160 --> 31:52.680]  Whoa!
[31:53.280 --> 31:54.720]  It is Rocket League!
[31:55.120 --> 31:56.620]  That was the attack I could do.
[31:57.020 --> 31:57.280]  No!
[31:58.480 --> 32:00.600]  Well, that was a cool attack.
[32:00.600 --> 32:01.120]  Lesson learned.
[32:01.480 --> 32:04.680]  Okay, okay, what's the plan?
[32:06.340 --> 32:06.560]  Okay.
[32:06.560 --> 32:06.600]  Okay.
[32:08.700 --> 32:10.160]  Wow, wow, wow.
[32:11.060 --> 32:12.640]  Not my own thing against me.
[32:13.680 --> 32:13.860]  Oh!
[32:15.860 --> 32:16.440]  You didn't,
[32:16.440 --> 32:17.600]  you didn't do it.
[32:20.480 --> 32:21.540]  I want the health.
[32:22.900 --> 32:23.920]  I want the health.
[32:24.900 --> 32:26.260]  Well, you got time, you got time.
[32:26.520 --> 32:28.000]  You got time. There you go, there you go.
[32:28.560 --> 32:29.480]  Go ahead, rocket, yeah!
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.560]  And then keep moving left. Take out tiny, tiny, teeny,
[32:32.660 --> 32:34.440]  tiny Tony. There you go.
[32:34.440 --> 32:35.280]  Flip him!
[32:35.540 --> 32:37.860]  You gotta do the Rocket League attack on him.
[32:39.460 --> 32:40.340]  Almost out of time.
[32:43.420 --> 32:44.780]  Did you do it?
[32:45.580 --> 32:48.180]  Yeah, I did.
[32:50.260 --> 32:51.840]  Nailed it. Did it attack?
[32:51.920 --> 32:52.780]  I don't think so.
[32:53.320 --> 32:53.460]  No.
[32:56.320 --> 32:57.700]  Well, that was disappointing.
[32:58.720 --> 33:00.000]  Did it attack?
[33:00.140 --> 33:00.620]  No.
[33:04.440 --> 33:04.700]  Ooh.
[33:06.540 --> 33:06.980]  Damn.
[33:07.960 --> 33:09.400]  Here we go. Okay, let's see.
[33:10.280 --> 33:10.720]  Hey!
[33:13.940 --> 33:15.060]  Sea level rise.
[33:15.960 --> 33:17.760]  Oh, I thought you were gonna fall down.
[33:17.980 --> 33:19.260]  Oh my God, that was awesome.
[33:19.600 --> 33:21.920]  Wow, wow. I'm not even mad at that.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.600]  That was fucking sick.
[33:25.640 --> 33:26.360]  Hey, I'm getting it.
[33:26.540 --> 33:27.500]  Wow. That was super neat.
[33:28.040 --> 33:28.360]  Uh-oh.
[33:30.140 --> 33:31.340]  Sudden death. Uh-oh.
[33:34.440 --> 33:35.520]  Here I come, boys.
[33:35.620 --> 33:36.400]  What's pepping us up?
[33:39.600 --> 33:42.440]  Here we go.
[33:45.100 --> 33:47.160]  Are you trying this one more time?
[33:51.920 --> 33:52.260]  Okay.
[33:52.560 --> 33:53.100]  To safety.
[33:54.220 --> 33:56.160]  Okay. Good.
[33:56.920 --> 33:57.620]  Here we go.
[33:59.340 --> 34:00.660]  And here we go.
[34:00.680 --> 34:02.840]  I don't think there's anything I can attack.
[34:02.920 --> 34:03.760]  And here we go.
[34:03.760 --> 34:04.600]  And here we go.
[34:05.800 --> 34:06.680]  Wrong way!
[34:07.680 --> 34:07.980]  Oh!
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.440]  Fired in the wrong direction!
[34:12.240 --> 34:12.900]  Okay, that's fine.
[34:12.980 --> 34:14.820]  I have the high ground.
[34:17.420 --> 34:19.120]  Which is definitely what I meant to do.
[34:19.340 --> 34:19.940]  That was intended.
[34:20.240 --> 34:21.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[34:23.840 --> 34:25.240]  Geoff, you might want to get to high ground.
[34:26.500 --> 34:28.080]  Uh, I can do that.
[34:28.300 --> 34:28.640]  Okay.
[34:28.820 --> 34:30.420]  I can do that, I believe.
[34:30.420 --> 34:32.680]  Okay. I believe it.
[34:32.680 --> 34:33.920]  Stay out of my house!
[34:35.660 --> 34:39.900]  Uh, how do I do that?
[34:46.660 --> 34:47.420]  What the fuck?
[34:50.260 --> 34:51.340]  Ooh, interesting.
[34:51.340 --> 34:52.400]  What is he doing?
[34:59.580 --> 35:00.260]  Oh!
[35:01.640 --> 35:02.320]  Oh!
[35:02.600 --> 35:02.940]  Oh, wow!
[35:04.760 --> 35:05.960]  Thanks to the girding,
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.820]  Andrew has protected me, so...
[35:08.460 --> 35:09.600]  Son of a bitch.
[35:09.800 --> 35:11.100]  Andrew, your house has been invaded.
[35:11.660 --> 35:13.320]  First of all, that's the front lawn.
[35:13.540 --> 35:14.440]  I can live with that.
[35:14.860 --> 35:17.400]  Second of all, you're trapped down there, dude.
[35:17.400 --> 35:19.740]  When the water rises, we can get out.
[35:20.380 --> 35:21.520]  When the water rises?
[35:21.640 --> 35:23.220]  We're not gonna make it that long!
[35:23.440 --> 35:24.620]  What are you talking about?
[35:24.780 --> 35:28.260]  First of all, I just grabbed some health, so I don't know what your life plans are.
[35:28.520 --> 35:29.860]  But I'm looking pretty good.
[35:31.540 --> 35:31.940]  Uh...
[35:31.940 --> 35:33.140]  Let's, uh...
[35:33.140 --> 35:34.080]  Move over to here.
[35:34.800 --> 35:35.580]  Let's, uh...
[35:35.580 --> 35:36.340]  What else do I got?
[35:39.100 --> 35:39.560]  Uh...
[35:39.560 --> 35:40.740]  I'm gonna gird her up again.
[35:40.860 --> 35:42.000]  Gird her up, gotta secure.
[35:43.440 --> 35:44.580]  You're gonna gird her up?
[35:46.260 --> 35:47.780]  You're just protecting Geoff?
[35:48.060 --> 35:49.040]  No, protecting me.
[35:49.840 --> 35:51.060]  Whose team are you on?
[35:51.400 --> 35:52.440]  Our team.
[35:54.220 --> 35:55.220]  That's my team.
[35:55.220 --> 35:57.080]  I think you got your answer.
[35:57.540 --> 36:00.080]  Yeah, I think we really got the answer there, didn't we?
[36:00.380 --> 36:00.900]  Yeah, it's good.
[36:00.900 --> 36:01.520]  Yeah, it sure did.
[36:02.180 --> 36:05.000]  A win for me is a win for me, and you also happened to win in that event.
[36:07.680 --> 36:08.080]  Insane.
[36:11.420 --> 36:11.820]  Alright.
[36:12.880 --> 36:14.360]  Nick, you got one health here.
[36:15.500 --> 36:15.840]  Yeah.
[36:17.760 --> 36:18.160]  So...
[36:24.360 --> 36:25.440]  What do I wanna do?
[36:26.460 --> 36:26.760]  Shit.
[36:28.260 --> 36:29.240]  What the hell is this?
[36:33.430 --> 36:34.430]  Alright, that didn't...
[36:34.430 --> 36:35.150]  Mmm.
[36:36.230 --> 36:36.670]  Mmm.
[36:37.890 --> 36:42.670]  Admittedly, I knew that character was going to die, so...
[36:42.670 --> 36:42.850]  Huh.
[36:43.510 --> 36:44.670]  And what was that you did?
[36:45.510 --> 36:47.870]  I shot a thing called a loozie.
[36:48.370 --> 36:49.730]  There's a lot of loozie there.
[36:50.430 --> 36:51.630]  Yeah, yeah, don't use that.
[36:52.010 --> 36:52.690]  Don't use that.
[36:54.450 --> 36:56.250]  Oh my god, that was fucking crazy.
[36:56.410 --> 36:59.290]  Loozie is not what we're gonna do, Eric, as long as I'm in my house.
[37:00.830 --> 37:01.310]  I understand.
[37:10.660 --> 37:12.200]  The full retreat has begun.
[37:12.420 --> 37:12.700]  Oh, absolutely.
[37:12.800 --> 37:14.020]  Yeah, not staying down there.
[37:14.100 --> 37:15.520]  There goes Batgirl, I think.
[37:17.400 --> 37:17.660]  Oh, yeah.
[37:19.060 --> 37:20.660]  Oh, the supplies.
[37:22.680 --> 37:25.620]  Dude, look at them all just bunched up right there.
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.640]  Yeah, it's true.
[37:40.040 --> 37:40.560]  Problem?
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.760]  Fix this.
[37:42.960 --> 37:47.880]  Thank you.
[37:51.340 --> 37:52.360]  Oh, there he goes.
[37:53.440 --> 37:54.280]  Bye, Tommy.
[37:54.740 --> 37:55.660]  He's going down to hell.
[37:57.140 --> 37:57.860]  He sure is.
[37:57.960 --> 37:59.860]  No, no, no, no!
[38:00.920 --> 38:01.880]  What happened?
[38:03.060 --> 38:03.300]  No!
[38:05.780 --> 38:06.480]  It's true!
[38:07.400 --> 38:08.360]  That's great.
[38:08.360 --> 38:10.080]  That's so good.
[38:11.220 --> 38:11.900]  Well...
[38:11.900 --> 38:12.720]  What happened?
[38:13.820 --> 38:15.220]  I mean...
[38:15.220 --> 38:17.700]  That was pretty impressive.
[38:19.960 --> 38:20.680]  Oh, no.
[38:21.240 --> 38:22.400]  What the fuck?
[38:24.740 --> 38:27.240]  How do I rotate this?
[38:29.360 --> 38:30.920]  Or is it just angle-based?
[38:32.960 --> 38:34.460]  I couldn't tell you unless I was doing it.
[38:44.100 --> 38:44.600]  Come on.
[38:45.380 --> 38:46.020]  You got this.
[38:46.100 --> 38:47.440]  You wanna come hang out with me up in the...
[38:47.440 --> 38:48.160]  Yeah, actually.
[38:49.780 --> 38:51.260]  Until I can get my bearings.
[38:51.420 --> 38:52.200]  I'd love to get in there.
[38:53.040 --> 38:55.140]  Get my bearings? What do you mean?
[38:56.240 --> 38:57.340]  I accidentally zoomed out.
[38:57.340 --> 38:58.320]  Oh, look. You can rotate it.
[39:15.500 --> 39:17.680]  I must say, I do kind of appreciate that.
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.240]  Oh, not that part.
[39:20.240 --> 39:21.320]  Not that part.
[39:22.020 --> 39:23.220]  Not that part.
[39:23.500 --> 39:24.140]  Now what?
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.280]  God damn it.
[39:26.640 --> 39:29.240]  I'm winning this for my team.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.140]  Well, your teammate's not helping, so...
[39:32.140 --> 39:33.280]  No, not at all.
[39:35.000 --> 39:36.660]  Well, he had to balance for me.
[39:38.960 --> 39:40.800]  I forgot I was in the car.
[39:41.120 --> 39:41.260]  I did.
[39:41.260 --> 39:41.680]  Cool.
[39:44.980 --> 39:46.420]  Is this me again?
[39:46.800 --> 39:47.660]  Yeah, it's you.
[39:48.300 --> 39:49.700]  Are you trapped because of me?
[39:49.980 --> 39:50.200]  Yes.
[39:51.160 --> 40:07.600]  Alright, here we go, Andrew.
[40:08.340 --> 40:09.960]  Big turn right here, dude.
[40:10.000 --> 40:10.740]  Make something happen.
[40:10.960 --> 40:13.040]  I'm in my house. I feel safe.
[40:13.720 --> 40:15.760]  Oh, you fucks are dead.
[40:17.120 --> 40:18.060]  It's over.
[40:18.880 --> 40:22.580]  It's over as soon as I figure out where the thing is that I want to use.
[40:23.940 --> 40:25.500]  Are you looking for Armageddon?
[40:25.620 --> 40:29.240]  The thing that comes from the sky that they, I think, eliminated probably in this level?
[40:29.620 --> 40:30.060]  Ah, shit.
[40:31.600 --> 40:32.000]  Well...
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.780]  Okay, so that's a yes.
[40:35.340 --> 40:36.140]  Uh-huh.
[40:37.160 --> 40:37.480]  Anytime.
[40:38.800 --> 40:39.320]  You got it.
[40:41.860 --> 40:42.980]  He's in his house, guys.
[40:44.360 --> 40:44.980]  You're safe there.
[40:45.160 --> 40:45.320]  Yeah.
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.360]  Okay, and here it goes.
[40:53.020 --> 40:55.300]  Did he just teleport in the same area?
[40:55.980 --> 40:57.320]  I used the safe teleport.
[40:57.720 --> 40:58.920]  So I'm even more safe.
[40:59.420 --> 40:59.900]  Uh-huh.
[41:00.280 --> 41:01.640]  I think that's what that means.
[41:01.900 --> 41:02.220]  Okay.
[41:05.280 --> 41:05.800]  That's good.
[41:06.100 --> 41:06.640]  That's good.
[41:07.900 --> 41:08.500]  I thought so too.
[41:08.880 --> 41:10.540]  I was really banking on it.
[41:10.600 --> 41:11.300]  Alright, Nick, here you go.
[41:12.420 --> 41:12.980]  Here you go, Nick.
[41:14.360 --> 41:15.320]  All the way up, bud.
[41:18.240 --> 41:19.120]  Alright, not that way.
[41:19.120 --> 41:19.440]  Nope.
[41:19.660 --> 41:22.040]  Not that way, alright.
[41:22.220 --> 41:22.700]  One more time.
[41:23.900 --> 41:24.040]  Yep.
[41:25.980 --> 41:27.140]  I seem to be stuck.
[41:29.560 --> 41:31.920]  Your ass is just lodged in there.
[41:33.900 --> 41:34.460]  There you go.
[41:34.980 --> 41:36.180]  Try to get right under that grid.
[41:36.880 --> 41:38.340]  Yeah, that fucking needle.
[41:39.240 --> 41:40.500]  There's no room under that.
[41:41.020 --> 41:43.300]  Okay, I can't repair that.
[41:43.700 --> 41:44.680]  That's a problem.
[41:45.340 --> 41:46.220]  I'm out of girders.
[41:49.440 --> 41:50.560]  Here we go, Geoff.
[41:50.920 --> 41:51.180]  Alright.
[41:51.640 --> 41:53.400]  The assault on Andrew's house has begun.
[41:54.940 --> 41:55.920]  What do you mean, no?
[41:56.020 --> 41:57.480]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[41:57.680 --> 42:00.140]  I thought I was gonna sell this house and move back to Worms 2.
[42:03.740 --> 42:04.180]  Crazy.
[42:04.240 --> 42:05.580]  There's no going back, Andrew.
[42:05.760 --> 42:06.720]  We can only move forward.
[42:07.340 --> 42:07.820]  That's true.
[42:09.940 --> 42:11.940]  Your old neighborhood shut down and laid low.
[42:13.100 --> 42:13.720]  Not again!
[42:15.960 --> 42:17.020]  That's less than ideal.
[42:17.020 --> 42:19.900]  That's probably real bad for us.
[42:20.100 --> 42:20.440]  Yeah.
[42:21.280 --> 42:22.160]  It's been an honor.
[42:22.520 --> 42:24.760]  I didn't do that much.
[42:30.760 --> 42:32.100]  There you go.
[42:32.600 --> 42:33.340]  Feeling good about this.
[42:35.760 --> 42:37.480]  Can I get past you?
[42:37.500 --> 42:38.300]  I don't think so.
[42:38.500 --> 42:41.080]  I don't think you can get past him and you definitely can't get past the mech.
[42:43.260 --> 42:44.580]  Nick has trapped you
[42:45.480 --> 42:47.160]  with everything he has.
[42:48.640 --> 42:49.300]  That's okay.
[42:49.480 --> 42:50.500]  With all that I have.
[42:50.680 --> 42:52.500]  Nick trapped you with everything he's got.
[42:53.060 --> 42:55.160]  I mean, he took every worm
[42:55.160 --> 42:57.280]  and every vehicle he had in his arsenal
[42:57.280 --> 42:57.960]  and he said,
[42:58.180 --> 42:58.900]  don't worry, man.
[42:59.960 --> 43:01.900]  Hey, listen.
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.040]  You thought Andrew was safe.
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.080]  Now we're both safe, Nick.
[43:06.420 --> 43:07.840]  I don't think it works that way.
[43:09.340 --> 43:10.220]  I can't...
[43:10.220 --> 43:12.600]  I seem to be in its crossfire, Geoff.
[43:12.600 --> 43:14.100]  Well, you'll...
[43:14.100 --> 43:15.440]  My turn?
[43:16.280 --> 43:17.020]  Alright, Andrew.
[43:17.760 --> 43:18.640]  What's the plan?
[43:19.340 --> 43:23.080]  You gotta do something from in there to make something happen here.
[43:23.400 --> 43:24.300]  Fire a rocket.
[43:24.800 --> 43:25.780]  Throw a fucking grenade.
[43:26.360 --> 43:28.040]  It's all fucking blown out on the left.
[43:28.100 --> 43:29.280]  You gotta do something.
[43:29.660 --> 43:30.960]  Damn right I'm gonna do something.
[43:32.880 --> 43:34.240]  He's coming out of his house!
[43:34.460 --> 43:35.780]  Stay the fuck off my lawn.
[43:36.280 --> 43:37.360]  He's coming out of his house!
[43:37.380 --> 43:38.060]  Oh my god.
[43:39.540 --> 43:41.100]  He's going back into his house!
[43:42.100 --> 43:43.460]  Wait, where the hell is that guy going?
[43:45.860 --> 43:47.640]  Get the fuck away from here.
[43:47.900 --> 43:49.560]  Alright, here we go, Nick. You got it.
[43:49.780 --> 43:50.420]  Nick, you're locked in.
[43:52.460 --> 43:53.260]  Hard send.
[43:54.040 --> 43:56.220]  Some sort of cluster bomb or something in there for him.
[43:56.820 --> 43:58.140]  You got it.
[43:58.180 --> 43:59.280]  Right there, bud. You got it.
[43:59.700 --> 43:59.900]  No!
[44:01.560 --> 44:03.300]  You gotta aim up at it.
[44:03.720 --> 44:05.080]  Why are you helping me?
[44:05.080 --> 44:06.960]  There you go.
[44:07.100 --> 44:07.620]  No!
[44:08.580 --> 44:09.100]  No!
[44:10.540 --> 44:12.340]  Andrew, I want you out of the house.
[44:13.320 --> 44:15.080]  You're becoming agoraphobic, Andrew.
[44:15.420 --> 44:16.300]  You're agoraphobic at this point.
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.600]  I need you out of the house.
[44:17.860 --> 44:18.560]  Uh oh.
[44:20.240 --> 44:22.500]  I need you out of the house.
[44:22.500 --> 44:23.340]  I'm out of the house.
[44:24.540 --> 44:26.960]  I'm gonna fucking haunt you, Eric.
[44:27.400 --> 44:28.740]  From the grave.
[44:28.940 --> 44:30.360]  Geoff, I did it.
[44:31.060 --> 44:32.820]  I'm out of the house.
[44:33.240 --> 44:34.200]  Geoff, I did it.
[44:35.060 --> 44:36.780]  That's amazing, Nick. You killed it, man.
[44:37.020 --> 44:38.200]  Thanks, man. I did it.
[44:38.860 --> 44:39.760]  Another Rocket League car.
[44:40.260 --> 44:40.860]  Alright, big dog.
[44:42.980 --> 44:44.560]  Time to make some big dog moves.
[44:45.680 --> 44:46.380]  Not that one, though.
[44:48.080 --> 44:48.800]  Come on.
[44:49.460 --> 44:51.500]  We don't have a great way to get out.
[44:52.220 --> 44:52.540]  No.
[44:53.520 --> 44:54.840]  And that water is getting there, huh?
[44:55.740 --> 44:56.220]  Get it.
[45:01.810 --> 45:03.050]  What am I working with?
[45:03.750 --> 45:04.270]  Yeah, what do you got?
[45:04.270 --> 45:06.370]  Do this.
[45:09.330 --> 45:09.890]  Yeah.
[45:11.370 --> 45:12.230]  Fuck me.
[45:15.290 --> 45:18.710]  Well, you know what? I gave myself a little bit more oxygen.
[45:19.330 --> 45:20.130]  Yeah, there you go.
[45:22.910 --> 45:25.510]  I fucking hate games like this.
[45:27.850 --> 45:29.870]  I want you out of the house.
[45:34.270 --> 45:35.390]  I just want you out of the house, buddy.
[45:37.890 --> 45:40.110]  I'm sorry, I can't hear ghosts.
[45:44.890 --> 45:46.930]  What the hell was that?
[45:48.590 --> 45:50.090]  That's how ghosts sound.
[45:50.510 --> 45:51.130]  Jesus, Nick.
[45:54.690 --> 45:58.590]  Oh, interesting play.
[45:59.450 --> 46:00.990]  Very interesting play.
[46:01.330 --> 46:01.570]  Excellent.
[46:04.810 --> 46:05.570]  Alright, Geoff.
[46:06.950 --> 46:08.010]  You're a very smart boy.
[46:09.330 --> 46:10.130]  Thank you.
[46:11.110 --> 46:11.450]  Alright.
[46:11.950 --> 46:13.430]  Until he swings around to see me.
[46:13.750 --> 46:15.010]  That's alright, then he's not looking at me.
[46:17.290 --> 46:18.250]  We flanked him.
[46:18.930 --> 46:19.770]  Yeah, that's when we pincer.
[46:22.290 --> 46:24.410]  Attack comes from the front, not from the sides.
[46:24.890 --> 46:25.770]  Like a Doberman.
[46:25.890 --> 46:26.390]  Out of the tank.
[46:26.390 --> 46:26.810]  Out of the tank.
[46:31.170 --> 46:35.410]  A little higher on the next one.
[46:35.790 --> 46:36.110]  Got it.
[46:39.760 --> 46:42.260]  You've done fuck all since I've died, Eric.
[46:42.900 --> 46:43.960]  Fuck all.
[46:45.000 --> 46:45.620]  I mean,
[46:46.260 --> 46:47.660]  if it helps,
[46:47.800 --> 46:49.580]  you weren't pulling your weight.
[46:49.700 --> 46:51.980]  The house was our future, Eric.
[46:54.360 --> 46:55.640]  Because of you.
[46:57.500 --> 46:58.080]  No.
[46:58.320 --> 46:58.780]  No.
[46:59.040 --> 47:01.460]  The house is gone because of you.
[47:09.180 --> 47:09.760]  Oh.
[47:12.500 --> 47:14.060]  I wish I could've
[47:14.060 --> 47:15.480]  walked a little further back.
[47:17.300 --> 47:19.380]  Throw it into the pee hole, Eric.
[47:21.560 --> 47:23.760]  Oh God, I have to pee so bad.
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.540]  Just a nice little
[47:27.540 --> 47:28.780]  underhand toss, Eric.
[47:29.140 --> 47:30.180]  Into the pee hole.
[47:33.140 --> 47:34.200]  That works too.
[47:34.340 --> 47:35.760]  Hey, that was great.
[47:36.860 --> 47:37.820]  That was, yeah.
[47:38.900 --> 47:39.720]  I did a good job.
[47:40.600 --> 47:41.000]  Alright, Nick.
[47:41.140 --> 47:43.480]  All of our hopes and dreams rest on you.
[47:44.460 --> 47:45.160]  Oh boy.
[47:46.640 --> 47:47.980]  There's no way
[47:47.980 --> 47:50.300]  Nick is going to jump into the water right now.
[47:50.380 --> 47:51.340]  I think there is.
[47:54.220 --> 47:55.520]  It's still stuck.
[47:56.440 --> 47:57.860]  It's still stuck.
[47:57.880 --> 47:58.180]  Yeah!
[47:58.800 --> 47:59.320]  Yes!
[48:01.300 --> 48:02.380]  Damn it, Nick!
[48:04.780 --> 48:05.900]  We all knew
[48:05.900 --> 48:07.540]  it was coming, but it was still gone.
[48:08.080 --> 48:08.600]  Infuriating.
[48:13.240 --> 48:15.240]  You still got this, Nick.
[48:17.020 --> 48:18.180]  Eric's hurting himself.
[48:18.360 --> 48:20.100]  Oh, I'm not worried about that right now.
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.600]  You got more damage?
[48:22.160 --> 48:23.520]  Or more health than he does.
[48:25.060 --> 48:26.080]  And the helicopter.
[48:26.720 --> 48:27.580]  Alright, Tony, here we go.
[48:29.980 --> 48:31.340]  You're locked in a roof, idiot.
[48:33.020 --> 48:34.060]  I say that respectfully.
[48:34.640 --> 48:34.960]  I'm dead.
[48:36.120 --> 48:37.140]  X is what?
[48:37.760 --> 48:39.940]  I don't know. Now you've just given him the helicopter.
[48:40.980 --> 48:41.600]  We probably don't want to...
[48:43.800 --> 48:44.200]  Uh...
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.940]  What was that?
[48:46.220 --> 48:47.440]  You could just like...
[48:47.440 --> 48:48.200]  Oh no, Nick!
[48:48.200 --> 48:48.220]  Nick!
[48:50.340 --> 48:51.140]  Fly away!
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.380]  I'm trying! It won't let me!
[48:53.740 --> 48:54.620]  It won't let me!
[48:56.020 --> 48:57.080]  It won't let me!
[48:57.120 --> 48:58.860]  That rock.
[48:59.940 --> 49:01.480]  Way to go, dude.
[49:03.160 --> 49:04.040]  Helicopter's a wreck, Nick.
[49:05.760 --> 49:06.760]  Hey, good news.
[49:06.800 --> 49:07.560]  He can't use it now.
[49:08.220 --> 49:09.460]  Oh yeah, hey guys, good news.
[49:12.640 --> 49:13.040]  No!
[49:18.460 --> 49:20.300]  Oh my god, Nick.
[49:20.540 --> 49:21.740]  You can unfuck this.
[49:24.240 --> 49:25.300]  He's got a safety himself.
[49:27.020 --> 49:28.780]  I respect it. You got the high ground.
[49:28.980 --> 49:29.580]  Alright, Nick.
[49:31.100 --> 49:31.700]  Alright, Nick.
[49:31.940 --> 49:33.820]  We're not dead yet.
[49:33.900 --> 49:34.540]  We're not out of it yet.
[49:34.780 --> 49:37.900]  You have the ability...
[49:37.900 --> 49:39.500]  To do the funniest thing.
[49:41.060 --> 49:41.940]  Oh, okay.
[49:43.660 --> 49:45.640]  What do you want me to drop?
[49:45.860 --> 49:48.420]  I would drop something incredibly dangerous.
[49:48.700 --> 49:49.440]  Like a...
[49:50.340 --> 49:51.380]  A grenade.
[49:51.680 --> 49:52.700]  Cluster grenade.
[49:53.160 --> 49:54.300]  Old lady or something.
[49:54.460 --> 49:58.320]  But I would drop down first and then I would be running away as it's popping.
[49:58.940 --> 50:00.360]  But that's not what you did.
[50:00.580 --> 50:01.940]  Oh yeah, that's not what I did.
[50:05.820 --> 50:06.860]  I win!
[50:06.860 --> 50:08.420]  I win!
[50:09.520 --> 50:10.220]  What a win!
[50:11.120 --> 50:12.160]  Andrew somehow...
[50:12.760 --> 50:15.260]  Andrew somehow came away with the victory.
[50:15.560 --> 50:16.580]  Even though I won.
[50:16.700 --> 50:17.000]  That's right.
[50:17.960 --> 50:19.180]  It's my first day.
[50:20.320 --> 50:22.460]  Congratulations to Eric on the victory.
[50:22.760 --> 50:23.980]  Thank you so much, Geoff.
[50:24.140 --> 50:25.380]  Geoff, you were a strong competitor.
[50:25.400 --> 50:28.420]  Andrew and I, we have a lot to learn from you.
[50:28.660 --> 50:31.140]  Clearly you were the tactician here.
[50:31.200 --> 50:32.200]  You were the Sun Tzu.
[50:32.680 --> 50:34.420]  You were explaining the art of war.
[50:34.420 --> 50:36.460]  Trevor and Andrew and the rest of us were just...
[50:37.080 --> 50:38.380]  But babes in the woods.
[50:40.900 --> 50:41.940]  Slack jawed.
[50:42.860 --> 50:43.460]  Two wins.
[50:44.420 --> 50:46.740]  I just wanted to sell the house.
[50:47.220 --> 50:48.200]  That's all I wanted.
[50:53.980 --> 50:55.780]  Wow, we gotta get Gavin back in here.
[50:55.920 --> 50:57.160]  This was a mess.
[50:57.900 --> 50:59.200]  Well, I guess we'll relegate...
[51:00.540 --> 51:02.500]  You can relegate me probably.
[51:03.040 --> 51:04.780]  Well, thank you so much for watching.
[51:04.780 --> 51:05.300]  Eric definitely won.
[51:05.820 --> 51:08.000]  Our regulation gameplay.
[51:08.460 --> 51:09.540]  I won again.
[51:10.180 --> 51:12.940]  If that made you mad, then mission accomplished.
[51:13.340 --> 51:14.640]  I win, baby.
[51:14.940 --> 51:15.960]  So, thank you so much.
[51:16.400 --> 51:19.060]  Don't forget to listen to Regulation Podcast.
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.460]  Check out our Patreon where you can get so much more content.
[51:23.960 --> 51:32.380]  And let a friend know about some video game videos and a podcast that you enjoy that's a name that you can actually say out loud in front of people.
[51:32.380 --> 51:35.400]  Now, which is a nice change of pace for us.
[51:36.740 --> 51:37.980]  That'll do it for this one, guys.
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.840]  Any wise words for the folks at home?
[51:41.780 --> 51:42.560]  I'm really sorry.
[51:43.360 --> 51:47.760]  Wasn't this one of those ones where, Eric, because you won, you get to pick what Andrew has for dinner now?
[51:49.260 --> 51:50.500]  I think you said that.
[51:50.520 --> 51:57.100]  Five, four, three, two...
[51:57.100 --> 51:57.840]  Bye!
