[00:01.280 --> 00:02.060]  You all right, Gavin?
[00:02.420 --> 00:02.600]  Yeah!
[00:02.720 --> 00:03.080]  There you go.
[00:03.200 --> 00:04.840]  We just hadn't tested all sitting here yet.
[00:04.920 --> 00:06.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one thing we haven't tested.
[00:07.660 --> 00:09.260]  Thank you to everyone joining us today.
[00:09.420 --> 00:10.340]  This is going to be...
[00:11.900 --> 00:12.540]  Mario Party.
[00:12.800 --> 00:13.520]  Mario-rific!
[00:13.680 --> 00:15.320]  And how long now until the pro rules?
[00:15.560 --> 00:17.220]  How long until the show and stuff on sale?
[00:17.280 --> 00:19.000]  Just over 30 minutes.
[00:19.200 --> 00:20.540]  So we'll take like a...
[00:20.540 --> 00:21.420]  We'll have a little break.
[00:21.420 --> 00:22.740]  A little break in the middle of Mario Party.
[00:22.980 --> 00:24.160]  Right at like the top of the hour.
[00:24.320 --> 00:25.180]  To see that chaos.
[00:25.400 --> 00:25.520]  Yep.
[00:25.900 --> 00:26.920]  You... Hey, Gavin. This party...
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.880]  I never set these up. Party rules?
[00:28.140 --> 00:28.320]  Yep.
[00:28.620 --> 00:28.760]  Okay.
[00:31.140 --> 00:31.520]  All right.
[00:31.520 --> 00:32.500]  Is Andrew playing?
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.040]  Yes, Andrew will be playing.
[00:34.400 --> 00:35.560]  Oh, Dilkong is here.
[00:36.240 --> 00:37.820]  So we can do Western Land.
[00:38.320 --> 00:39.260]  We can do...
[00:39.260 --> 00:41.300]  We gotta do Bowser's Keep.
[00:42.400 --> 00:43.640]  You wanna do Bowser's Keep?
[00:43.820 --> 00:44.040]  Yeah!
[00:44.740 --> 00:45.180]  You gotta...
[00:45.180 --> 00:48.720]  You know, unlike Bowser's Keep, you gotta get 30 achievements in the game.
[00:49.480 --> 00:49.900]  Fuck that.
[00:49.900 --> 00:52.680]  And you decided to do that right in the middle of 30 turns.
[00:52.680 --> 00:54.400]  I did it at around like day 10, yeah.
[00:54.520 --> 00:54.920]  Insane.
[00:55.060 --> 00:55.240]  Yeah.
[00:55.900 --> 00:57.320]  Well, I knew this day would come.
[00:57.460 --> 00:58.120]  And I wanted to be ready for it.
[00:58.120 --> 01:01.940]  This will also be a 30-turn Mario party, just not over 30 days.
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.740]  Are you guys ready to lock in for about 90 minutes?
[01:04.880 --> 01:06.620]  I think it's about 210 minutes.
[01:06.700 --> 01:07.040]  What do you mean?
[01:07.420 --> 01:07.500]  What?
[01:08.160 --> 01:08.520]  No.
[01:09.020 --> 01:09.120]  210!
[01:09.720 --> 01:11.160]  Motion mini-games are on. Mini-game help off, maybe?
[01:11.360 --> 01:11.560]  Yeah.
[01:11.820 --> 01:12.800]  Why would you have it off?
[01:13.920 --> 01:14.620]  You want it off?
[01:14.880 --> 01:15.660]  There's no practicing?
[01:16.480 --> 01:16.960]  Motion mini-games are on.
[01:16.960 --> 01:17.720]  You don't wanna practice, Andrew?
[01:17.840 --> 01:18.980]  Motion mini-games are on.
[01:19.060 --> 01:19.520]  Are we good?
[01:19.620 --> 01:21.020]  Random mini-game selection. Are we good?
[01:21.360 --> 01:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:21.660 --> 01:23.300]  I think that's still looking good.
[01:25.220 --> 01:26.040]  And I like...
[01:26.040 --> 01:27.980]  Look at Andrew's little robot just keeping an eye on you.
[01:27.980 --> 01:28.620]  I'm watching.
[01:29.300 --> 01:31.800]  I want to see your eyes when you betray me.
[01:34.620 --> 01:36.860]  Watching him back over the M&M's was a highlight.
[01:38.320 --> 01:40.620]  After that, he slammed into every piece of furniture in here.
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.220]  King Bowser's Keep.
[01:44.940 --> 01:45.980]  I've never played here.
[01:46.540 --> 01:47.360]  I don't think any of us have.
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.740]  You guys made fun of me for taking the time to unlock this.
[01:48.740 --> 01:49.620]  I'm glad you did it.
[01:49.700 --> 01:51.200]  Told me we'd never need it.
[01:51.300 --> 01:51.980]  But here we are.
[01:53.440 --> 01:54.300]  It looks good.
[01:55.220 --> 01:57.280]  And thanks to everyone who's dropping subs in the...
[01:57.280 --> 01:58.420]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[01:58.420 --> 01:59.080]  Oh, yeah. Thank you so much.
[01:59.080 --> 02:01.000]  The gingles, the whip, and the gang.
[02:01.420 --> 02:03.060]  Everyone's here dropping subs in.
[02:03.740 --> 02:04.520]  This rocks.
[02:04.600 --> 02:05.260]  This is really awesome.
[02:05.440 --> 02:07.960]  Dropping subs while Nick Manning drops loads.
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.500]  And we have a bet open from the mods right now.
[02:15.060 --> 02:15.500]  Ridiculous.
[02:16.720 --> 02:18.460]  Who will get the first star?
[02:18.780 --> 02:20.860]  Andrew, Nick, Gavin, Geoff.
[02:21.800 --> 02:23.140]  Who do you guys think is...
[02:23.140 --> 02:24.780]  Who do you guys think is in the lead?
[02:24.780 --> 02:27.940]  Fucking subs all over the chat.
[02:29.020 --> 02:31.340]  It's actually pretty tied up, but Gavin...
[02:31.780 --> 02:33.900]  Everyone's saying that Gavin's gonna get the first star.
[02:34.020 --> 02:34.780]  Oh, that's some pressure.
[02:35.020 --> 02:35.460]  Oh, that's nice.
[02:35.800 --> 02:36.020]  30%?
[02:36.200 --> 02:37.480]  Oh, Andrew took the lead.
[02:38.000 --> 02:38.280]  Uh-oh.
[02:38.420 --> 02:38.980]  That's right.
[02:40.340 --> 02:41.520]  Yeah, they think it's on Dil then.
[02:41.640 --> 02:41.760]  Okay.
[02:42.520 --> 02:43.140]  What is that?
[02:43.380 --> 02:45.480]  A giant vault where he keeps the items he steals.
[02:46.480 --> 02:47.280]  Oh, bro.
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.900]  You can find the passcode?
[02:50.260 --> 02:51.360]  Oh, is this blueprints?
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.580]  Don't say that, Nick's gonna lose.
[02:55.740 --> 02:56.640]  Or, never mind.
[02:57.200 --> 02:57.900]  Here we go!
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.320]  I heard that recently.
[02:59.660 --> 03:00.300]  Oh, shit!
[03:01.920 --> 03:02.720]  Come on!
[03:03.080 --> 03:03.260]  Oh, balls!
[03:03.280 --> 03:03.620]  Wow.
[03:04.160 --> 03:04.740]  Oh, piss balls.
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.580]  World's already against Dil!
[03:09.140 --> 03:10.420]  Universe versus Dilkong.
[03:10.580 --> 03:10.980]  Dilkong!
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.540]  Well, look at those subs.
[03:12.660 --> 03:13.280]  Thank you so much.
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.120]  Oh my god.
[03:14.220 --> 03:15.120]  Thanks for dropping subs.
[03:16.160 --> 03:19.820]  Do you think you'll say dropping subs every time some subs drop?
[03:19.900 --> 03:20.140]  Ugh.
[03:20.340 --> 03:20.420]  All right.
[03:21.900 --> 03:22.620]  Dropping subs.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.380]  Dropping subs.
[03:23.580 --> 03:24.220]  Where's that star?
[03:24.600 --> 03:24.860]  Okay.
[03:25.100 --> 03:26.080]  Oh my god.
[03:26.080 --> 03:26.480]  Come on.
[03:27.260 --> 03:27.980]  Jesus Christ.
[03:28.180 --> 03:29.260]  I'm just saying Howard Stern quit.
[03:29.380 --> 03:29.620]  Okay.
[03:30.060 --> 03:30.640]  Like, yeah.
[03:31.840 --> 03:33.060]  All right, still 20 bucks.
[03:35.820 --> 03:36.880]  Man, it's hot in here, isn't it?
[03:36.960 --> 03:37.800]  It's so hot.
[03:38.020 --> 03:39.320]  Do you want me to turn the AC down a bunch?
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.240]  Yeah, please.
[03:40.340 --> 03:40.600]  Yeah.
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.360]  We've never had all the lights on us in a room together.
[03:43.360 --> 03:45.800]  I knew it was gonna be like this, but oof, oof.
[03:45.940 --> 03:46.860]  One of the...
[03:46.860 --> 03:49.860]  Don't worry, it's only gonna be 100 billion degrees for the next five months.
[03:49.860 --> 03:50.080]  Yep.
[03:51.460 --> 03:52.380]  All right, Geoff.
[03:53.220 --> 03:55.140]  All right, let's go ahead and, uh, badonk.
[03:55.280 --> 03:56.260]  What a start!
[03:56.500 --> 03:56.860]  Nine.
[03:57.540 --> 03:57.900]  Wow.
[03:58.440 --> 04:00.000]  You can explore the map for us now.
[04:00.380 --> 04:01.300]  Santa, thanks for the subs.
[04:01.480 --> 04:01.940]  Thank you.
[04:04.120 --> 04:05.160]  What are you getting? What are you buying?
[04:06.040 --> 04:06.400]  Ooh.
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.380]  Just looking at your mic.
[04:08.560 --> 04:09.140]  Oh, how's it looking?
[04:09.300 --> 04:09.780]  Looks good.
[04:14.700 --> 04:16.060]  All right, turned it way down.
[04:16.440 --> 04:16.880]  Thank you.
[04:17.040 --> 04:17.260]  Yeah.
[04:17.700 --> 04:18.320]  Should be good now.
[04:19.740 --> 04:21.220]  More gifted subs, my god.
[04:21.520 --> 04:22.140]  This is crazy.
[04:22.440 --> 04:23.140]  Guys, what an anniversary.
[04:23.480 --> 04:23.880]  What a party.
[04:24.420 --> 04:25.160]  This has been great.
[04:25.500 --> 04:26.260]  What did you set it to?
[04:26.800 --> 04:27.120]  68.
[04:27.240 --> 04:28.760]  I was gonna do 69, but...
[04:29.240 --> 04:30.640]  I didn't want anyone to get any ideas.
[04:31.080 --> 04:31.820]  I mean...
[04:33.660 --> 04:36.320]  Now it's nine to go this way, but if I go this way...
[04:37.920 --> 04:39.400]  What are the odds someone beats you to it?
[04:41.440 --> 04:41.760]  Oh!
[04:42.300 --> 04:42.920]  Uh-oh.
[04:42.940 --> 04:44.500]  Is this good?
[04:44.580 --> 04:45.460]  Do you like this?
[04:45.600 --> 04:46.780]  What if he just smashes you into...
[04:46.780 --> 04:47.520]  Oh my god!
[04:47.520 --> 04:48.060]  Oh!
[04:49.420 --> 04:50.500]  Oh, it's spinning.
[04:50.520 --> 04:50.980]  What does that mean?
[04:52.060 --> 04:53.140]  So where do we go now?
[04:53.180 --> 04:55.720]  Why did Bowser put himself in a cage?
[04:56.200 --> 04:56.860]  So no matter...
[04:56.860 --> 04:58.320]  It's gonna be way longer now.
[04:58.780 --> 04:58.800]  Yeah.
[04:59.080 --> 04:59.740]  Oh, no.
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.060]  Yeah.
[05:01.460 --> 05:02.060]  You saw that too?
[05:04.620 --> 05:06.160]  Oh, you also pay attention?
[05:06.940 --> 05:07.740]  Another nine?
[05:08.080 --> 05:08.320]  Nice.
[05:08.400 --> 05:09.380]  Now which way will I go?
[05:12.040 --> 05:14.780]  Now, if you want to copy me, I bought a mushroom.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.940]  Oh, you bought a mushroom?
[05:16.940 --> 05:18.980]  Oh, you can buy a direction change? Is that what that is?
[05:19.540 --> 05:20.100]  Yeah, for two.
[05:20.300 --> 05:20.620]  Oh!
[05:21.400 --> 05:22.400]  That might come in handy later on.
[05:22.400 --> 05:24.060]  You know what? I like your style.
[05:24.260 --> 05:24.560]  Thanks.
[05:26.840 --> 05:27.840]  Let's see where we go.
[05:29.100 --> 05:30.100]  I think it's a real copy guy.
[05:30.360 --> 05:30.820]  Yeah, that's why.
[05:31.480 --> 05:32.860]  That's the thing you know most about him.
[05:32.880 --> 05:33.680]  Didn't think about it as much.
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.600]  I copy people's food orders, though.
[05:35.780 --> 05:36.840]  That can't... yeah, you do.
[05:36.880 --> 05:38.180]  Wow, that is significantly longer.
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.100]  Now you gotta go the other way.
[05:39.320 --> 05:39.640]  Yeah.
[05:43.080 --> 05:45.760]  Oh, it's a little Mecha Cooper. A little Mechanic.
[05:50.040 --> 05:51.960]  Let's see if you can keep up the nine streak.
[05:52.680 --> 05:53.900]  Nobody's favorite warrior.
[05:53.980 --> 05:54.980]  Oh, Andrew, you want nine?
[05:55.120 --> 05:55.900]  I want nine!
[05:56.260 --> 05:58.000]  Let me charge this bad boy up.
[05:58.680 --> 05:59.660]  How do you charge it?
[05:59.920 --> 06:00.220]  Hold it.
[06:00.260 --> 06:00.580]  Just hold down.
[06:01.180 --> 06:01.580]  Nine!
[06:02.120 --> 06:02.560]  Three!
[06:03.240 --> 06:04.200]  Oh, you get an item!
[06:05.300 --> 06:05.720]  Yay!
[06:06.640 --> 06:07.440]  What you gonna buy?
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.940]  I wanna... I wanna buy away.
[06:12.360 --> 06:12.800]  Nice!
[06:13.100 --> 06:13.540]  Yeah!
[06:13.540 --> 06:17.260]  So when everyone's gone to the right, I'll just go left?
[06:18.940 --> 06:20.980]  And not by the star, because I can't afford it.
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.920]  I thought you got a bonus for a second. I was about to be so mad.
[06:33.480 --> 06:36.020]  Hey, Eric, were people surprised by the office?
[06:36.260 --> 06:40.260]  Yes, yeah, everyone's really excited. And then also, Beater Juice is in here saying,
[06:40.260 --> 06:42.120]  I'm the Pico Park stats guy.
[06:42.560 --> 06:45.080]  And I'm gonna be doing some stats for this.
[06:45.820 --> 06:46.620]  You're the only one.
[06:46.740 --> 06:47.800]  Thank you, Beater Juice.
[06:47.980 --> 06:50.420]  How are our Pico Park stats looking these days?
[06:54.240 --> 06:57.300]  That stream, that Pico Park stream that we did...
[06:57.300 --> 06:58.980]  The one we bailed on?
[06:59.060 --> 07:00.160]  Oh my God.
[07:04.010 --> 07:05.150]  Give me these.
[07:05.910 --> 07:09.970]  Hayden in the chat said, I missed the start. What did Ryan and Tina do for them?
[07:10.070 --> 07:10.950]  Great question, Hayden.
[07:13.570 --> 07:16.790]  Is everything about that fucked up? That's awesome.
[07:20.010 --> 07:21.950]  Ray and Tina gave us a bunch of furniture.
[07:21.950 --> 07:24.870]  A bunch of furniture. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you, Tina.
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.050]  Oh, you changed it back.
[07:26.390 --> 07:26.750]  Take that, Nick!
[07:28.810 --> 07:29.610]  Damn, wild.
[07:30.070 --> 07:31.310]  Yeah, I think you know what you have to do, Kevin.
[07:31.890 --> 07:35.310]  Oh, no.
[07:36.170 --> 07:37.750]  I was wondering why you went that way.
[07:41.010 --> 07:42.390]  First game, first mini-game of the day.
[07:42.390 --> 07:43.210]  Oh, four player?
[07:43.570 --> 07:44.330]  What do we got?
[07:44.430 --> 07:44.770]  Nice.
[07:45.230 --> 07:45.730]  Treetop Treasure.
[07:45.970 --> 07:46.090]  Yeah.
[07:46.990 --> 07:48.530]  Tiny, tiny triathlon.
[07:49.030 --> 07:50.190]  So small, this triathlon.
[07:50.290 --> 07:51.030]  Seems like a lot of work.
[07:51.630 --> 07:52.070]  Very tiny.
[07:54.390 --> 07:56.670]  Oh, I never re-zoomed the lens in.
[07:58.310 --> 07:59.230]  Come on!
[07:59.590 --> 08:00.050]  Sorry.
[08:00.630 --> 08:01.410]  I wanted to see Andrew.
[08:01.870 --> 08:02.170]  Oh!
[08:02.430 --> 08:03.310]  Oh, this one.
[08:04.350 --> 08:05.570]  Okay, so it's...
[08:05.570 --> 08:06.070]  Swim.
[08:06.230 --> 08:07.170]  Oh, man.
[08:07.790 --> 08:08.150]  Jump.
[08:10.410 --> 08:12.130]  Come on, you slow bastard.
[08:12.330 --> 08:13.350]  The kettle is this.
[08:13.730 --> 08:14.170]  Jump is that.
[08:14.290 --> 08:14.390]  Okay.
[08:15.230 --> 08:15.730]  Got it.
[08:15.870 --> 08:16.730]  I think I got it.
[08:16.730 --> 08:17.230]  I'll do it on the night.
[08:19.170 --> 08:19.990]  We'll do it live.
[08:26.690 --> 08:27.430]  That's gonna be fun.
[08:28.650 --> 08:29.270]  There we go.
[08:30.030 --> 08:30.610]  Alright, I'm good.
[08:31.770 --> 08:32.530]  Okay, here we go.
[08:33.250 --> 08:33.970]  Alright, I'm gonna get...
[08:33.970 --> 08:34.870]  Alright, this is getting real.
[08:35.190 --> 08:35.230]  Yeah.
[08:36.290 --> 08:37.210]  Oh, Christ.
[08:37.250 --> 08:37.750]  Oh, God.
[08:39.530 --> 08:40.050]  Go!
[08:42.690 --> 08:43.490]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[08:43.710 --> 08:44.750]  Oh, what the?
[08:45.730 --> 08:46.590]  Geoff paused it.
[08:46.870 --> 08:47.190]  Geoff!
[08:47.490 --> 08:49.190]  Geoff, you son of a...
[08:49.190 --> 08:50.010]  Oh, that code.
[08:50.130 --> 08:51.070]  I took a picture.
[08:54.010 --> 08:55.110]  Move, you idiot.
[08:55.250 --> 08:55.650]  Move!
[08:55.910 --> 08:56.430]  Come on.
[08:56.590 --> 08:56.970]  No!
[08:58.130 --> 08:58.930]  Damn you!
[09:00.470 --> 09:00.990]  No!
[09:02.730 --> 09:03.250]  Go!
[09:03.610 --> 09:03.850]  Go!
[09:03.850 --> 09:04.050]  Alright.
[09:04.670 --> 09:04.870]  Go!
[09:05.130 --> 09:05.770]  No, damn it!
[09:05.870 --> 09:06.210]  No!
[09:06.490 --> 09:07.370]  No, damn it!
[09:07.790 --> 09:08.530]  Oh, God!
[09:08.630 --> 09:09.270]  No, damn it!
[09:10.510 --> 09:11.070]  Fuck!
[09:11.290 --> 09:11.490]  No!
[09:12.150 --> 09:13.910]  That sucks so bad!
[09:15.090 --> 09:16.330]  That was so hard!
[09:18.010 --> 09:20.530]  Geoff paused it and I took a fucking shot.
[09:26.790 --> 09:27.910]  Happy anniversary!
[09:28.650 --> 09:28.750]  Yay!
[09:28.750 --> 09:29.350]  One year!
[09:29.610 --> 09:30.170]  Congratulations!
[09:30.890 --> 09:31.090]  Yay!
[09:31.090 --> 09:36.050]  I gotta say, all of us up here with Andrew on the arm as a little robot, it's pretty cool.
[09:36.170 --> 09:37.090]  I like that.
[09:37.190 --> 09:37.330]  Yeah.
[09:37.910 --> 09:38.950]  The gang's all here.
[09:39.230 --> 09:41.130]  Only 29 more turns.
[09:41.350 --> 09:41.890]  Oh, boy.
[09:42.330 --> 09:42.770]  Hopefully.
[09:43.350 --> 09:44.470]  We're in the homestretch now, boys.
[09:45.910 --> 09:46.590]  I'm hot.
[09:48.210 --> 09:49.490]  It's from moving so much.
[09:52.710 --> 09:53.350]  Hell yeah.
[09:53.710 --> 09:54.890]  Oh, I can't fucking afford it.
[09:55.430 --> 10:00.630]  A little under half an hour until we get to everything on sale in the store.
[10:01.730 --> 10:03.110]  And don't forget, support us on Patreon.
[10:03.310 --> 10:04.790]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod.
[10:05.150 --> 10:05.630]  Thank you so much.
[10:05.630 --> 10:06.470]  That's the best way to support us.
[10:06.610 --> 10:06.770]  Thank you.
[10:06.770 --> 10:07.830]  Thank you, everyone who's watching.
[10:07.930 --> 10:09.570]  Really appreciate you guys being here for our anniversary.
[10:10.110 --> 10:14.330]  Yeah, we typically don't say stuff like, support us on Patreon, but we're definitely gonna say it today.
[10:14.370 --> 10:17.810]  No, I figure once a year, we can probably get after it.
[10:17.970 --> 10:19.050]  We're gonna get after it today.
[10:19.050 --> 10:19.210]  Yeah.
[10:19.750 --> 10:20.310]  Oh, God.
[10:20.410 --> 10:21.390]  Getting after it.
[10:21.850 --> 10:22.190]  Oh, thank you.
[10:22.190 --> 10:22.810]  Oh, that's a bonus.
[10:22.810 --> 10:23.550]  That's pretty good.
[10:24.650 --> 10:25.050]  Ooh.
[10:25.410 --> 10:25.690]  What'd you get again?
[10:25.870 --> 10:27.430]  12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12.
[10:27.650 --> 10:27.810]  Yeah.
[10:27.930 --> 10:28.270]  Yeah!
[10:28.550 --> 10:29.330]  That's pretty good.
[10:31.410 --> 10:32.310]  I'll take it.
[10:33.770 --> 10:34.410]  Take it.
[10:34.590 --> 10:36.950]  All right, so I want to roll low enough to not go past.
[10:38.390 --> 10:38.790]  Nine.
[10:40.130 --> 10:41.310]  What do you think you're doing there?
[10:41.930 --> 10:42.830]  What you thinking about?
[10:43.610 --> 10:44.950]  Causing some problems for people.
[10:44.950 --> 10:46.310]  I like problems.
[10:46.570 --> 10:47.630]  Yeah, I mean, he's gonna get it.
[10:47.830 --> 10:48.950]  He's gonna get that star if you don't.
[10:49.070 --> 10:50.370]  The guy like me likes problems.
[10:50.370 --> 10:52.930]  Oh, that would mean that Geoff would come back to all of this.
[10:52.990 --> 10:53.150]  Oh.
[10:53.230 --> 10:54.170]  Yeah, but Geoff has no money.
[10:54.510 --> 10:55.310]  Oh, that's a good point.
[10:56.010 --> 10:56.370]  Not yet.
[10:56.470 --> 10:57.670]  You haven't done the next game.
[10:58.850 --> 11:00.030]  Oh, Nick's gonna get that star.
[11:00.050 --> 11:00.730]  Not a nine.
[11:01.730 --> 11:02.050]  Oh!
[11:06.430 --> 11:07.230]  Now what do you do?
[11:13.930 --> 11:14.950]  Second guessing that decision.
[11:15.530 --> 11:16.570]  Oh, you went left anyway?
[11:16.830 --> 11:20.990]  I went left anyway, because maybe if somehow it's still there, I can just turn the direction and come back for it.
[11:21.050 --> 11:21.270]  That's true.
[11:21.390 --> 11:22.010]  Oh, you get money.
[11:22.270 --> 11:23.730]  Oh, yeah, yeah, you will get this cash.
[11:23.730 --> 11:24.290]  Ah!
[11:26.570 --> 11:27.730]  What am I doing?
[11:29.010 --> 11:30.670]  Cool, I can afford it.
[11:34.060 --> 11:35.040]  Hey, Geoff, what's up?
[11:35.500 --> 11:36.080]  Oh, not much.
[11:36.580 --> 11:37.320]  Fight, fight, fight.
[11:37.360 --> 11:40.820]  Bobbin said, happy belated birthday, Eric. I love the shirts. Come on.
[11:41.100 --> 11:42.720]  They're fucking all ratty boy.
[11:43.220 --> 11:44.900]  Oh, yeah, yesterday was ratty boy Saturday.
[11:46.240 --> 11:47.360]  That's not what we're calling it.
[11:47.380 --> 11:48.300]  Happiest day of the year.
[11:48.380 --> 11:48.920]  Ratty boy Saturday?
[11:49.820 --> 11:51.320]  I hate ratty boy Saturday.
[11:51.320 --> 11:53.440]  Put out the ratty boy blindside that we have to make twice.
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.660]  My favorite thing about that, by the way, my favorite thing about that is that Andrew spent the whole time saying that his video got corrupted.
[12:00.820 --> 12:01.160]  Yes.
[12:01.480 --> 12:03.740]  Which it didn't. It didn't press record.
[12:04.220 --> 12:08.360]  But the video that we made to replace it is glitchy as shit.
[12:08.460 --> 12:09.980]  Yeah, it also glitches it.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.440]  Genuinely corrupted.
[12:12.460 --> 12:13.880]  Like, are you kidding me?
[12:14.420 --> 12:16.320]  It's cursed. It's a cursed video.
[12:18.320 --> 12:19.360]  Oh, can you flip direction here?
[12:19.400 --> 12:20.420]  Flickers all over the place.
[12:20.480 --> 12:22.500]  Just like, come on, man.
[12:23.440 --> 12:26.060]  You know, this was kind of a blindside today. The office.
[12:27.480 --> 12:29.060]  We blindsided you, you fools.
[12:31.220 --> 12:35.440]  Now you know how it feels when somebody drops ratty boy on you or something about AIDS.
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.560]  We've learned a lot the past year.
[12:41.580 --> 12:43.720]  It's been a good year. It's been a really good year.
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.880]  It has been, though, a really fast and slow year.
[12:45.880 --> 12:46.860]  Yeah, crazy.
[12:49.940 --> 12:50.720]  Oh, shit.
[12:50.780 --> 12:52.020]  Oh, yeah. Big time.
[12:53.440 --> 12:54.640]  See, imagine if you didn't have practice.
[12:55.960 --> 12:57.380]  I'd be lost. Oh, oh.
[12:57.580 --> 12:57.760]  Yeah.
[12:58.940 --> 12:59.380]  All right.
[13:00.640 --> 13:01.200]  Okie dokie.
[13:06.170 --> 13:08.830]  So we don't want to touch the electricity is what I'm gathering.
[13:09.170 --> 13:10.310]  No, no, no, you can touch that, I think.
[13:10.390 --> 13:12.010]  Which is crazy, because in most games you want to touch it.
[13:12.110 --> 13:12.990]  Yeah, it's how you get superpowers.
[13:13.170 --> 13:16.330]  Usually in video games, they want you to do it, don't they?
[13:16.430 --> 13:17.530]  Oh, shit.
[13:17.970 --> 13:19.470]  Nick's not going to find out, so it's okay.
[13:19.930 --> 13:20.410]  Oh, God.
[13:20.630 --> 13:21.150]  Nick's toast.
[13:21.230 --> 13:23.210]  I'm all right. Oh, actually, you killed me.
[13:23.550 --> 13:24.070]  I did what?
[13:24.070 --> 13:24.830]  You killed me.
[13:25.090 --> 13:25.230]  What?
[13:26.550 --> 13:27.150]  Oh, sorry.
[13:27.270 --> 13:27.550]  Ow!
[13:28.050 --> 13:28.350]  Geoff!
[13:29.290 --> 13:29.890]  Oh, God.
[13:30.050 --> 13:32.230]  Wow, how is Nick still in this thing?
[13:32.250 --> 13:32.990]  What do you mean?
[13:33.710 --> 13:35.250]  It's going slow so far.
[13:35.370 --> 13:35.970]  You're doing great.
[13:36.130 --> 13:36.970]  Get in the fire, Dilkon.
[13:37.050 --> 13:37.690]  Get in the electricity.
[13:38.250 --> 13:38.910]  I'm good.
[13:39.810 --> 13:41.350]  You should test it first, then I'll get in.
[13:45.810 --> 13:47.070]  Oh, you bastard!
[13:47.850 --> 13:48.450]  This thing's speeding up.
[13:51.230 --> 13:52.030]  Oh, shit.
[13:52.030 --> 13:54.690]  Well, that's it for me.
[13:54.690 --> 13:55.910]  Go, go, go, go.
[13:55.910 --> 13:57.370]  The mole's done, too.
[13:59.770 --> 14:00.450]  I died.
[14:00.550 --> 14:02.410]  Oh, shit!
[14:02.410 --> 14:02.950]  Dil!
[14:04.930 --> 14:06.190]  Dilling it up!
[14:08.270 --> 14:10.050]  Squad 9 for victory!
[14:13.710 --> 14:14.430]  Victory!
[14:14.430 --> 14:14.630]  Victory!
[14:20.190 --> 14:21.830]  Landed on Gavin's knee.
[14:21.830 --> 14:22.870]  I was in your heaviest shit.
[14:23.970 --> 14:25.430]  That was an international...
[14:27.090 --> 14:28.290]  International strike.
[14:28.570 --> 14:30.690]  That was an international incident right there.
[14:30.710 --> 14:31.190]  That was awesome.
[14:31.570 --> 14:31.950]  Intercontinental.
[14:32.250 --> 14:32.850]  Yeah, really.
[14:33.050 --> 14:33.710]  Oh, Jesus.
[14:34.030 --> 14:34.750]  Holy shit.
[14:34.910 --> 14:36.430]  Did you say swan dive eventually?
[14:36.430 --> 14:36.890]  Yeah!
[14:37.190 --> 14:38.110]  Yeah, absolutely.
[14:38.570 --> 14:38.770]  Yep.
[14:40.550 --> 14:41.650]  Oh, my God.
[14:45.710 --> 14:46.750]  Uh-oh!
[14:46.750 --> 14:46.850]  Uh-oh!
[14:46.970 --> 14:47.630]  Oh, shit.
[14:47.830 --> 14:48.590]  Oh, this is bad.
[14:50.470 --> 14:50.670]  Whoa.
[14:51.770 --> 14:52.650]  Holy shit.
[14:52.730 --> 14:53.350]  These are bad.
[14:53.670 --> 14:54.970]  Oh, there's so many of them now.
[14:56.030 --> 14:57.450]  All right, turn 3.
[15:02.870 --> 15:04.350]  What are you gonna do?
[15:05.330 --> 15:05.910]  Kick ass.
[15:06.730 --> 15:07.650]  What the fuck?
[15:08.390 --> 15:10.670]  Wait, does that shoot you back?
[15:10.910 --> 15:11.090]  You fuck!
[15:11.090 --> 15:13.090]  Oh, wow.
[15:14.050 --> 15:15.950]  Is that just in time for...
[15:15.950 --> 15:16.150]  No!
[15:17.710 --> 15:19.170]  Geoff, I want to thank you personally.
[15:19.230 --> 15:20.150]  No kidding.
[15:21.350 --> 15:24.230]  Wow, you don't even have to use your shit, dude.
[15:24.430 --> 15:25.810]  I didn't even have to waste my blood.
[15:27.570 --> 15:29.730]  How did he hit you with his little robot?
[15:29.850 --> 15:30.750]  That was crazy.
[15:32.070 --> 15:33.050]  Little swan dive.
[15:34.570 --> 15:35.730]  You're pretty far away though, dude.
[15:36.090 --> 15:37.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:38.170 --> 15:39.310]  Three, you're almost there, right?
[15:39.430 --> 15:39.610]  Yeah.
[15:39.990 --> 15:40.730]  See you soon.
[15:41.230 --> 15:42.570]  Oh, what's this fucking one?
[15:42.970 --> 15:43.670]  Is this...
[15:43.670 --> 15:44.730]  Hit the dice block.
[15:44.970 --> 15:47.450]  We should post a clip of Andrew hurting me from...
[15:48.010 --> 15:49.370]  Sorry about that.
[15:50.050 --> 15:50.450]  Sorry?
[15:51.210 --> 15:51.990]  He's not sorry.
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.690]  I am, I didn't mean to hit him.
[15:55.150 --> 15:56.810]  I'm just gonna dive off the couch peacefully.
[15:57.710 --> 15:58.650]  Look at you, six coins.
[15:59.350 --> 15:59.770]  What is it?
[15:59.850 --> 16:00.510]  Oh, here's another one.
[16:00.690 --> 16:01.250]  Oh, okay.
[16:03.630 --> 16:04.770]  Wow, you're getting lucky.
[16:05.590 --> 16:06.130]  Yeah, no kidding.
[16:06.290 --> 16:06.730]  So far.
[16:07.650 --> 16:08.030]  Ooh!
[16:08.410 --> 16:09.310]  An item bag!
[16:09.310 --> 16:09.670]  Ooh!
[16:11.010 --> 16:12.530]  Dude, Morse bag.
[16:13.710 --> 16:14.350]  Let's see what you got.
[16:14.410 --> 16:14.850]  Let's see.
[16:14.910 --> 16:15.890]  Put him in my bag!
[16:16.430 --> 16:16.810]  Dice.
[16:16.990 --> 16:17.890]  Nice, and a mushroom.
[16:19.370 --> 16:20.250]  Super creepy!
[16:23.890 --> 16:25.010]  Okay, another mushroom.
[16:25.030 --> 16:25.470]  You got two shrooms.
[16:29.490 --> 16:30.330]  I'll take that.
[16:34.410 --> 16:35.770]  I just need to...
[16:35.770 --> 16:35.970]  Hey, use your item.
[16:36.410 --> 16:37.090]  Not roll a one.
[16:37.190 --> 16:38.450]  I don't think I'm gonna use the item yet.
[16:38.450 --> 16:39.850]  I don't think I'm gonna do it.
[16:39.930 --> 16:40.330]  Roll a one.
[16:40.810 --> 16:41.610]  Please, not a one!
[16:41.830 --> 16:41.870]  One.
[16:42.050 --> 16:42.950]  Please, not a one!
[16:43.230 --> 16:43.250]  One!
[16:44.230 --> 16:44.690]  Seven!
[16:45.490 --> 16:47.210]  Gavin with the first star!
[16:47.410 --> 16:48.210]  Like a one.
[16:48.990 --> 16:49.450]  Wait!
[16:49.730 --> 16:50.110]  Lose money!
[16:51.030 --> 16:52.550]  You lost five coins!
[16:54.650 --> 16:55.110]  Terrible.
[16:56.390 --> 16:58.390]  Still, he hits you so hard.
[16:58.770 --> 16:59.830]  Eric was showing me the clip.
[17:00.090 --> 17:01.310]  He hits you so hard.
[17:01.510 --> 17:03.590]  He just swan dives right on you.
[17:05.090 --> 17:06.870]  Thank God I didn't lose more.
[17:06.930 --> 17:08.190]  I thought you were gonna lose more!
[17:08.450 --> 17:09.050]  You suck.
[17:09.270 --> 17:10.090]  That would've been awesome.
[17:10.230 --> 17:11.210]  I would've loved that.
[17:11.430 --> 17:11.730]  Holy shit.
[17:11.730 --> 17:12.910]  I would've taken that all day long.
[17:12.910 --> 17:15.630]  So what percentage had me as the first star?
[17:16.390 --> 17:17.330]  Let's find out.
[17:19.110 --> 17:20.210]  Where did that bet go?
[17:23.670 --> 17:24.390]  It's up there?
[17:24.510 --> 17:24.630]  Okay.
[17:25.390 --> 17:26.450]  I think you have to hit A, Gavin.
[17:26.810 --> 17:27.090]  It's alright.
[17:28.650 --> 17:29.730]  I was like, why isn't it showing?
[17:32.630 --> 17:33.430]  Okay, so...
[17:33.430 --> 17:35.250]  Gavin had 29%.
[17:35.250 --> 17:35.990]  Oh shit!
[17:36.550 --> 17:36.570]  Yeah!
[17:36.570 --> 17:37.150]  Yes!
[17:37.610 --> 17:39.810]  If this mof takes the star...
[17:39.810 --> 17:40.190]  Hell yeah!
[17:40.750 --> 17:41.270]  Take the star!
[17:41.950 --> 17:43.790]  Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[17:43.890 --> 17:45.310]  Take it, Bowser!
[17:46.090 --> 17:46.870]  Take it, Bowser!
[17:47.370 --> 17:47.870]  Take that star!
[17:49.470 --> 17:49.870]  Oh!
[17:51.310 --> 17:52.130]  Damn it.
[17:53.530 --> 18:01.290]  The purple towelette and 278 others won 638,000 regulation points.
[18:01.450 --> 18:01.670]  Wow!
[18:01.670 --> 18:02.450]  Oh my God.
[18:02.530 --> 18:04.050]  Oh, there's like a trove somewhere?
[18:04.230 --> 18:05.450]  Oh, that's behind his cage?
[18:05.450 --> 18:06.330]  The vault?
[18:06.870 --> 18:06.990]  His cage!
[18:07.590 --> 18:09.450]  When do we find out some...
[18:10.330 --> 18:12.010]  I bet it's...
[18:12.010 --> 18:13.950]  The hammer bro seems to be guarding.
[18:13.970 --> 18:15.050]  It's probably 1, 2, 3, 4.
[18:16.210 --> 18:18.910]  I also pinned the clip of Andrew doing a swan dive.
[18:19.210 --> 18:19.670]  Thank you.
[18:20.430 --> 18:22.650]  Yeah, no problem. So people can grab that if they want.
[18:26.010 --> 18:26.770]  That is one!
[18:28.550 --> 18:28.970]  Ten!
[18:29.790 --> 18:31.010]  Nope, that's not ten.
[18:31.850 --> 18:32.310]  Oh yeah.
[18:32.950 --> 18:33.770]  It's half a ten.
[18:33.910 --> 18:34.590]  Which way will you go?
[18:34.590 --> 18:35.850]  Oh, you're gonna switch the direction?
[18:35.990 --> 18:36.250]  Go down.
[18:38.170 --> 18:39.590]  It'll just send you right back.
[18:39.710 --> 18:40.190]  Nah, I'm good.
[18:40.950 --> 18:41.090]  Okay.
[18:41.310 --> 18:42.050]  Might as well just go.
[18:43.410 --> 18:43.770]  Yeah.
[18:44.670 --> 18:45.370]  Might as well.
[18:45.630 --> 18:46.570]  Might as well.
[18:48.190 --> 18:51.390]  Ooh, is this our first team game here?
[18:52.030 --> 18:52.310]  Yep.
[18:52.770 --> 18:53.410]  Plan G.
[18:53.890 --> 18:54.610]  Plan G.
[18:54.610 --> 18:55.430]  Nick, we got this.
[18:55.990 --> 18:56.770]  We got this.
[18:57.290 --> 18:59.210]  Dude, just so many gifted subs today.
[18:59.430 --> 19:00.130]  Thank you guys so much.
[19:00.370 --> 19:01.130]  Thank you so much.
[19:01.970 --> 19:02.470]  Thank y'all.
[19:02.470 --> 19:03.930]  Yeah, appreciate everyone coming through today.
[19:04.310 --> 19:05.210]  Celebrating the anniversary.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.010]  This has been a lot of fun.
[19:06.210 --> 19:06.770]  Oh yes.
[19:06.910 --> 19:07.590]  Oh no!
[19:08.750 --> 19:09.590]  Yeah, this is good.
[19:09.730 --> 19:10.370]  Oh no.
[19:10.990 --> 19:14.610]  What happened on the 30 turn where it was just like you guys couldn't get on the same page?
[19:14.610 --> 19:19.870]  I was just, it was early for my brain and I could not process at a certain point.
[19:19.890 --> 19:21.450]  What time is it there, Andrew?
[19:21.910 --> 19:22.250]  10?
[19:22.410 --> 19:23.210]  9.43.
[19:23.910 --> 19:24.990]  Might still be early enough.
[19:25.270 --> 19:25.730]  Oh, we're good.
[19:27.990 --> 19:29.150]  Better just leave it just like this.
[19:29.350 --> 19:29.490]  Yeah.
[19:30.150 --> 19:30.850]  No, why would you...
[19:36.410 --> 19:36.770]  Yes!
[19:38.710 --> 19:39.070]  Well...
[19:40.450 --> 19:41.910]  I thought you were going to do something, Nick.
[19:42.850 --> 19:43.990]  I thought you were going to do something.
[19:44.190 --> 19:44.930]  You know what?
[19:45.190 --> 19:45.950]  That's on us.
[19:46.850 --> 19:47.210]  Together.
[19:47.470 --> 19:49.390]  Alright, there's no way we can be hit by this if...
[19:49.390 --> 19:49.630]  Yeah.
[19:50.370 --> 19:50.750]  We're good.
[19:57.380 --> 19:57.620]  Oh!
[20:00.540 --> 20:00.900]  Yeah!
[20:06.920 --> 20:07.820]  Good job, Nick.
[20:08.380 --> 20:08.740]  Great!
[20:08.740 --> 20:10.160]  We got a victory!
[20:11.400 --> 20:12.560]  Oh my god.
[20:15.740 --> 20:16.180]  Alright.
[20:16.660 --> 20:17.260]  Locked in.
[20:17.760 --> 20:19.040]  Geoff, I'm not going to move.
[20:19.660 --> 20:20.540]  You know what to do.
[20:21.520 --> 20:22.240]  I'm going to move.
[20:23.040 --> 20:23.360]  Fuck.
[20:23.780 --> 20:24.160]  Yes!
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.180]  Oh shit.
[20:25.280 --> 20:25.960]  Sorry, I tried.
[20:26.100 --> 20:26.920]  I wasn't able to get up.
[20:26.920 --> 20:27.500]  No, it's alright.
[20:27.640 --> 20:27.920]  It's alright.
[20:28.160 --> 20:28.480]  It's alright.
[20:29.500 --> 20:30.100]  Oh no!
[20:33.140 --> 20:34.020]  Oh shit.
[20:39.450 --> 20:40.330]  Yeah, well I'll die.
[20:43.700 --> 20:44.690]  Oh my god.
[20:45.130 --> 20:46.110]  What?
[20:47.740 --> 20:48.230]  Guys.
[20:48.870 --> 20:49.170]  Guys.
[20:51.570 --> 20:54.390]  What in the world?
[20:55.090 --> 20:55.410]  I'll take that.
[20:56.310 --> 20:56.750]  Alright.
[20:57.230 --> 20:57.650]  Nobody move.
[21:08.960 --> 21:09.620]  Yes!
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.300]  Maybe I wasn't the problem on that side.
[21:14.480 --> 21:15.960]  You guys suck.
[21:17.700 --> 21:19.320]  Oh brother.
[21:23.380 --> 21:23.820]  Man.
[21:28.220 --> 21:28.660]  Nick!
[21:29.540 --> 21:29.980]  Wait.
[21:30.460 --> 21:30.760]  No!
[21:31.320 --> 21:31.660]  What?
[21:31.840 --> 21:32.560]  Why did I do that?
[21:32.620 --> 21:33.680]  I don't know.
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.420]  Andrew, you weren't the problem.
[21:36.420 --> 21:36.600]  I miss Adam.
[21:36.820 --> 21:37.220]  I miss Adam.
[21:39.280 --> 21:40.480]  Nick has so much noon.
[21:40.520 --> 21:40.800]  Yeah!
[21:42.100 --> 21:43.120]  I didn't sleep well.
[21:43.620 --> 21:43.940]  That's fair.
[21:52.180 --> 21:52.880]  Oh my god!
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.480]  I hit the button twice!
[21:53.900 --> 21:54.500]  There we go, we're fine.
[21:54.820 --> 21:55.260]  Oh!
[21:55.600 --> 21:55.920]  We're fine.
[21:56.660 --> 21:57.020]  Fuck.
[21:57.020 --> 21:57.700]  Wow.
[21:57.940 --> 21:58.480]  Is that it?
[21:58.660 --> 21:59.000]  Yeah.
[21:59.720 --> 22:00.120]  Well.
[22:00.920 --> 22:02.020]  Yeah, we did it!
[22:02.140 --> 22:02.440]  Hell yeah.
[22:02.440 --> 22:02.740]  Damn it.
[22:03.060 --> 22:05.400]  I take responsibility, Andrew.
[22:05.500 --> 22:06.020]  That's okay.
[22:06.260 --> 22:06.660]  Master's class.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.660]  Because I made mistakes too.
[22:07.940 --> 22:08.780]  Market manipulation.
[22:09.820 --> 22:11.680]  Look, it just says birthday on it.
[22:12.740 --> 22:13.660]  Can't see the happy.
[22:13.760 --> 22:14.160]  Birthday!
[22:15.140 --> 22:15.340]  Birthday!
[22:15.340 --> 22:17.080]  It's not a happy birthday, but it is a birthday.
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.240]  Oh, you just get to keep the coins.
[22:18.340 --> 22:18.820]  Okay, well.
[22:19.840 --> 22:20.640]  No change.
[22:20.840 --> 22:23.580]  I'll tell you what, I'm not getting the minigame star.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.580]  Dilkong has 50 coins.
[22:26.360 --> 22:27.640]  I got a coin or two.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.580]  Lay down a good space or two.
[22:32.680 --> 22:33.760]  Where you going, Montyball?
[22:34.560 --> 22:37.120]  Going in raw was wild on that turn, dude.
[22:40.200 --> 22:42.720]  Does it feel like they walk slower on these ramps?
[22:43.560 --> 22:44.440]  It does feel that way.
[22:44.740 --> 22:45.920]  Another item bag?
[22:47.280 --> 22:47.760]  Ooh.
[22:48.880 --> 22:49.120]  Let's do it.
[22:49.520 --> 22:51.220]  There's gonna be peanut M&Ms in that thing.
[22:53.860 --> 22:55.260]  They're everywhere, Andrew.
[22:55.260 --> 22:56.060]  They're everywhere.
[22:56.280 --> 22:58.260]  Oh, star steel.
[22:58.580 --> 22:59.060]  Goddamn.
[22:59.220 --> 22:59.980]  That was quick.
[23:02.280 --> 23:03.240]  Shop up.
[23:08.930 --> 23:09.890]  Turn four.
[23:10.250 --> 23:13.430]  It's so nice to see the new turn number and not have to quit the game.
[23:13.610 --> 23:13.850]  Yeah!
[23:15.910 --> 23:18.150]  Yeah, we're four days into this recording already.
[23:23.070 --> 23:27.490]  As you guys are playing this and everything, how was it going back to Achievement City?
[23:28.170 --> 23:28.690]  Oh, yeah.
[23:29.130 --> 23:29.790]  It was crazy.
[23:29.990 --> 23:33.390]  Well, firstly, it all loads at the same time now.
[23:33.630 --> 23:34.970]  Yeah, the game is very different.
[23:35.330 --> 23:41.030]  The draw distance is the entire city, which makes it seem really small.
[23:41.310 --> 23:42.670]  Yeah, that was the first thing.
[23:43.730 --> 23:46.770]  It's like going back to your childhood bedroom as an adult and going,
[23:47.010 --> 23:48.050]  how did I fit in here?
[23:48.150 --> 23:49.850]  It's like when I go back to Waitrose and I'm like,
[23:49.890 --> 23:52.330]  oh, it used to be so big and intimidating and now it's tiny.
[23:55.230 --> 23:56.210]  Where am I going?
[23:58.370 --> 23:59.530]  Classic board looker.
[24:00.890 --> 24:02.270]  At least we can see it this time.
[24:02.730 --> 24:02.950]  It's true.
[24:03.130 --> 24:04.850]  Oh, Crucified Donkey five gifted.
[24:05.170 --> 24:06.690]  Thank you so much, Crucified Donkey.
[24:07.350 --> 24:08.790]  Crucified Donkey's back, baby.
[24:10.570 --> 24:11.310]  Crucified Donkey.
[24:11.370 --> 24:12.430]  I was telling my wife about that.
[24:12.490 --> 24:13.310]  Crucified Donkey.
[24:13.610 --> 24:15.330]  Nevertheless, hugs McJugs.
[24:15.690 --> 24:18.130]  Fucking Schindler's Fist.
[24:19.610 --> 24:20.450]  Get him, Gavin.
[24:21.310 --> 24:21.630]  Oh!
[24:22.410 --> 24:23.130]  That should be enough.
[24:25.070 --> 24:25.890]  Yeah, four beat him.
[24:26.890 --> 24:28.010]  That was only three.
[24:28.430 --> 24:28.990]  Good job.
[24:30.090 --> 24:30.370]  Yeah.
[24:32.170 --> 24:33.950]  I feel like I'm playing Expedition 33.
[24:36.270 --> 24:37.450]  Did you ever beat that?
[24:37.970 --> 24:40.050]  No, I'm still like 90% of the way done.
[24:40.610 --> 24:41.770]  Still stuck on that one, dude.
[24:42.150 --> 24:43.410]  Yeah, I just haven't gotten back to it.
[24:43.930 --> 24:45.130]  You guys are trapped.
[24:45.330 --> 24:45.870]  This is hell.
[24:46.670 --> 24:48.390]  How do I open that door that's there?
[24:49.690 --> 24:50.290]  You gotta go around.
[24:50.470 --> 24:51.270]  I think you circle back.
[24:51.590 --> 24:52.330]  Oh, piss.
[24:53.670 --> 24:54.310]  I'm gonna get a drink.
[24:54.310 --> 24:55.930]  What are you gonna get?
[24:56.050 --> 24:56.510]  White Monster?
[24:56.670 --> 24:57.210]  A little sody.
[24:57.350 --> 24:57.850]  Anyone want one?
[24:58.310 --> 24:59.090]  I'd love one.
[25:00.130 --> 25:00.770]  What do you want, Nick?
[25:00.910 --> 25:01.810]  The Dr. Pepper, please.
[25:02.410 --> 25:02.910]  Oh, fuck.
[25:02.950 --> 25:03.370]  Jesus.
[25:03.830 --> 25:05.450]  The mannequin scared me.
[25:06.610 --> 25:07.590]  All right, you're unmuted now.
[25:08.370 --> 25:10.670]  Granny Gumjob 69, 10 gifted.
[25:10.990 --> 25:11.410]  Wow.
[25:11.930 --> 25:13.070]  Granny Gumjob.
[25:13.370 --> 25:13.950]  Love it.
[25:16.130 --> 25:18.790]  Oh, and Nick says happy birthday to all the MILFs out there.
[25:19.270 --> 25:19.470]  Yeah.
[25:20.370 --> 25:21.030]  Oh, yeah.
[25:21.370 --> 25:21.770]  Whoa!
[25:22.590 --> 25:22.890]  Okay.
[25:24.190 --> 25:25.770]  What do you mean?
[25:26.470 --> 25:27.610]  I might as well own it.
[25:28.670 --> 25:30.510]  Gerpol's Glug Race, 10 gifted.
[25:32.150 --> 25:33.150]  Thank you so much.
[25:33.510 --> 25:35.410]  The Waistler, 5 gifted.
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.590]  You put it just out of reach.
[25:37.350 --> 25:39.730]  I went in there and immediately got scared by the mannequins.
[25:39.870 --> 25:40.010]  Yeah.
[25:41.790 --> 25:43.150]  That was me coming in this morning.
[25:45.630 --> 25:47.270]  Thanks for getting scared by those.
[25:47.310 --> 25:48.130]  I was really hoping for that.
[25:48.150 --> 25:49.550]  Oh, you mission accomplished.
[25:51.370 --> 25:52.170]  Oh, more golf.
[25:52.170 --> 25:52.830]  I'm not here yet, is he?
[25:52.930 --> 25:53.130]  Oh!
[25:53.410 --> 25:55.170]  My Joy-Con was on some peanut M&Ms.
[25:55.250 --> 25:55.850]  Come on!
[25:55.970 --> 25:56.370]  They're everywhere!
[25:57.930 --> 25:59.010]  Bust those open.
[25:59.510 --> 26:01.350]  Vintage Booty, Sneezes Christ.
[26:01.790 --> 26:02.890]  Thank you for the gifted.
[26:03.250 --> 26:04.010]  Sneezes Christ.
[26:04.010 --> 26:04.330]  Oh, no.
[26:04.470 --> 26:05.370]  Sneezes Christ.
[26:05.810 --> 26:06.530]  Sneezes Christ.
[26:07.470 --> 26:08.210]  Sneezes Christ.
[26:08.710 --> 26:09.050]  All right.
[26:09.150 --> 26:10.050]  I'm feeling good.
[26:10.930 --> 26:13.030]  Uncle Kai, the gang's all here.
[26:13.270 --> 26:14.170]  Do it on the night.
[26:17.840 --> 26:21.540]  Thank you for the gifted sub, Granny Gumjob 69.
[26:26.020 --> 26:27.740]  Otterly Chaotic's here, so is the rest of the gang.
[26:27.820 --> 26:30.400]  We really appreciate you guys being here as these idiots try to play golf.
[26:30.540 --> 26:31.020]  Look at them go.
[26:31.140 --> 26:31.460]  There we go.
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.220]  Roll, you piece of shit!
[26:37.420 --> 26:39.640]  How come nobody's urge to kill is rising?
[26:39.780 --> 26:40.500]  It's risen!
[26:42.800 --> 26:43.200]  No!
[26:46.660 --> 26:49.740]  Four, three, two, one!
[26:50.800 --> 26:51.400]  Get it off!
[26:51.540 --> 26:52.540]  Fuck it off!
[26:53.540 --> 26:54.700]  Thank you, Concus Boncus.
[26:56.780 --> 27:00.000]  We did just record golf with your friends not too long ago.
[27:00.620 --> 27:00.860]  Stop pissing me off!
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.800]  It's sort of like this.
[27:02.920 --> 27:03.520]  Ah, damn it.
[27:04.060 --> 27:05.240]  Well, it went about this way.
[27:08.420 --> 27:09.500]  I jumped right off.
[27:09.860 --> 27:10.640]  Get in there.
[27:10.820 --> 27:11.500]  Oh, you teased it.
[27:12.560 --> 27:14.020]  Zigzagging Centaur Bicycle.
[27:14.560 --> 27:16.540]  You can name yourself anything on this website.
[27:17.600 --> 27:18.400]  Damn it!
[27:18.500 --> 27:19.060]  Damn it!
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.380]  I'm freaking out!
[27:21.760 --> 27:22.240]  Shit!
[27:24.380 --> 27:25.860]  Get in the hole, Geoff!
[27:26.080 --> 27:26.400]  Yeah!
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.120]  Dillkong victory!
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.620]  Dillkong's doing really well.
[27:33.780 --> 27:34.340]  He's good at golf.
[27:35.260 --> 27:36.020]  Back to back!
[27:36.780 --> 27:37.100]  Okay.
[27:38.340 --> 27:40.240]  Oh, he did it!
[27:40.420 --> 27:41.340]  I got you!
[27:41.620 --> 27:42.220]  I got you!
[27:42.740 --> 27:44.260]  You thought I wasn't gonna do it!
[27:45.780 --> 27:49.000]  Hey, we got ten gifted subs from Shittison Kane.
[27:49.540 --> 27:50.980]  Thank you, Shittison Kane.
[27:51.020 --> 27:51.520]  Thank you!
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.020]  Should we get an airbag, Patrick?
[27:55.140 --> 27:55.320]  Yeah.
[27:55.480 --> 27:56.200]  For all those crashes.
[27:56.380 --> 27:58.200]  Yeah, we gotta get like a pillow for him or something.
[27:58.520 --> 27:59.160]  Jesus Christ.
[27:59.740 --> 28:02.040]  Oh, she's in the danger zone, man.
[28:02.120 --> 28:02.660]  It's Peach!
[28:02.960 --> 28:03.160]  Peach!
[28:04.820 --> 28:06.100]  You guys are awesome.
[28:06.240 --> 28:06.840]  This is great.
[28:06.980 --> 28:10.200]  And eight minutes until we launch everything on the store.
[28:10.200 --> 28:10.660]  Eight minutes?
[28:10.940 --> 28:11.340]  Wow!
[28:11.580 --> 28:14.200]  Yep, so maybe after this turn we'll have a little sit-down.
[28:14.240 --> 28:14.520]  Yeah!
[28:15.180 --> 28:17.900]  A little sit-down while you're seated.
[28:19.880 --> 28:21.320]  Maybe we'll have a little stand-up.
[28:21.460 --> 28:21.860]  Ooh!
[28:22.820 --> 28:24.200]  And don't forget...
[28:24.200 --> 28:24.680]  You got a type 5?
[28:25.240 --> 28:28.020]  Ratty Boy shirts are on sale now.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.680]  You should have said you got a type 5.
[28:30.860 --> 28:30.940]  Yeah!
[28:32.900 --> 28:34.540]  Champion sphincter, five gifted.
[28:37.120 --> 28:38.000]  Fucking dickhead.
[28:39.100 --> 28:40.720]  Go fuck yourself, man.
[28:42.500 --> 28:42.940]  Goddamn.
[28:42.960 --> 28:43.820]  Oh my god.
[28:44.000 --> 28:44.740]  I fucking hate myself.
[28:46.540 --> 28:48.020]  This day is crazy.
[28:48.180 --> 28:48.820]  You guys are nuts.
[28:49.020 --> 28:50.220]  Thank you for your gifted subs.
[28:50.440 --> 28:51.100]  Oh my god.
[28:52.100 --> 28:54.520]  I can't believe we started this in 2024.
[28:54.960 --> 28:55.500]  Isn't that nuts?
[28:55.600 --> 28:55.820]  That's crazy.
[28:56.060 --> 28:56.260]  Insane.
[28:57.340 --> 29:00.160]  One year ago today, I was sweating bullets going,
[29:00.260 --> 29:02.260]  Is anyone going to give a fuck about what we're doing?
[29:02.900 --> 29:03.840]  Should we turn on the Patreon?
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.140]  Do we have careers still?
[29:08.140 --> 29:09.880]  We just stood around shrugging at each other?
[29:09.900 --> 29:10.720]  Yeah, pretty much.
[29:11.360 --> 29:11.660]  All right.
[29:12.600 --> 29:13.260]  Don't roll a one.
[29:13.720 --> 29:15.920]  I was about to put my application in a Best Buy.
[29:16.800 --> 29:17.580]  Oh, that's cool.
[29:17.600 --> 29:18.280]  We could have worked together.
[29:20.400 --> 29:22.500]  Every time I applied there, I was turned down.
[29:22.540 --> 29:22.860]  Really?
[29:23.040 --> 29:23.600]  Yeah, I told them to.
[29:23.900 --> 29:24.400]  You fuck!
[29:24.620 --> 29:27.100]  Is there a place you always wanted to work, but you never got hired at?
[29:27.180 --> 29:27.860]  Was it Best Buy for you?
[29:30.040 --> 29:30.920]  Barnes & Noble.
[29:31.360 --> 29:31.680]  Yeah.
[29:31.920 --> 29:33.060]  For me, it was a grocery store.
[29:33.100 --> 29:34.760]  I wasn't going to a grocery store so bad.
[29:35.100 --> 29:36.920]  Yeah, this one was competitive to Workaway Trace.
[29:37.220 --> 29:38.280]  I think I would have liked...
[29:39.080 --> 29:41.040]  On paper, I think I would have liked to GameStop,
[29:41.120 --> 29:42.820]  but everyone I know who worked there said it sucked.
[29:42.920 --> 29:44.800]  That's everyone that I know that worked there.
[29:45.000 --> 29:45.320]  Everyone.
[29:45.740 --> 29:45.860]  I don't know.
[29:46.600 --> 29:47.700]  I feel like I'd be decent at it.
[29:48.700 --> 29:49.140]  Nick!
[29:49.300 --> 29:50.320]  Here we go, baby!
[29:51.760 --> 29:52.200]  Wow!
[29:52.300 --> 29:53.100]  On the board!
[29:54.200 --> 29:54.720]  Hot dog.
[29:54.840 --> 29:55.580]  Back at it!
[29:55.900 --> 29:56.560]  We got Spummer.
[29:56.680 --> 29:57.580]  Spummer gifting subs.
[29:57.720 --> 29:58.260]  Spummer's here.
[29:58.580 --> 29:59.360]  Oh, Spummer!
[29:59.660 --> 30:00.020]  Spummer!
[30:00.040 --> 30:01.620]  We're about to get into a Spummer-Summer.
[30:01.780 --> 30:02.820]  Your season's coming up, baby.
[30:03.900 --> 30:06.100]  Yeah, it's about to be 106 on Wednesday.
[30:06.260 --> 30:06.820]  Yeah, I saw that.
[30:07.020 --> 30:09.080]  Should we do one gameplay with Spummer every summer?
[30:10.380 --> 30:11.660]  Spummer-Summer, I love it!
[30:13.040 --> 30:14.100]  If people just go,
[30:14.100 --> 30:15.680]  Who the fuck is this guy?
[30:16.200 --> 30:16.240]  Oh!
[30:16.240 --> 30:17.160]  They used to work with him?
[30:17.920 --> 30:18.920]  Oh no, I gotta get ready.
[30:21.020 --> 30:21.460]  Uh-oh.
[30:21.560 --> 30:22.820]  Let fate decide.
[30:23.080 --> 30:23.420]  Really?
[30:25.280 --> 30:25.640]  No!
[30:26.020 --> 30:27.260]  I knew I had to get ready!
[30:30.180 --> 30:31.540]  Oh, push it, push it, push it, push it!
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.140]  Come on, get away, get away, get away!
[30:33.140 --> 30:34.140]  You gotta be careful, Nick.
[30:34.220 --> 30:35.800]  They don't like when you let fate decide.
[30:36.120 --> 30:36.360]  Get away, get away, get away!
[30:36.380 --> 30:38.300]  Listen, I don't like fate deciding on me either.
[30:38.420 --> 30:39.680]  They get all bent out of shape.
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.460]  Listen, pure, unadulterated chance, Andrew.
[30:43.460 --> 30:44.860]  Oh yeah, no, you know what?
[30:44.880 --> 30:45.420]  And it was fair.
[30:45.540 --> 30:46.120]  It should have been me.
[30:46.480 --> 30:46.840]  No matter what.
[30:48.720 --> 30:49.600]  Go hide in a pipe.
[30:50.080 --> 30:50.760]  Six minutes.
[30:51.580 --> 30:53.060]  Six minutes till everything's on sale.
[30:53.160 --> 30:53.880]  Back to the start!
[30:56.380 --> 30:56.880]  Uh-oh.
[30:57.900 --> 30:58.300]  Uh...
[30:58.300 --> 30:59.200]  Here's a rattle-rattle.
[30:59.620 --> 31:00.260]  A reward for going back?
[31:00.280 --> 31:00.620]  No!
[31:01.660 --> 31:02.040]  Ooh!
[31:02.820 --> 31:02.880]  Shit.
[31:02.880 --> 31:03.600]  Let's get richer.
[31:03.860 --> 31:04.800]  Nick's position, dude.
[31:04.820 --> 31:05.220]  Oh, hello.
[31:05.440 --> 31:06.540]  Oh, sure, buy up the store.
[31:06.640 --> 31:06.920]  I will.
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.140]  You can do that.
[31:16.340 --> 31:16.900]  I will.
[31:16.900 --> 31:19.400]  That's a real jed piece item.
[31:20.300 --> 31:20.700]  Oh.
[31:21.080 --> 31:22.060]  We have, um...
[31:23.020 --> 31:24.960]  We have 4,400 people watching right now.
[31:25.000 --> 31:25.180]  Whoa!
[31:27.340 --> 31:28.380]  Happy Mother's Day.
[31:28.520 --> 31:29.560]  Take that, Ray!
[31:30.200 --> 31:31.300]  What does Ray have, double that?
[31:31.580 --> 31:32.680]  Shut up, shut up, shut up!
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.940]  Shut up, shut up, shut up!
[31:34.300 --> 31:38.000]  Ray's not even streaming, but there's 8,000 people in his chatroom, just in case.
[31:38.480 --> 31:40.380]  Oh, that's so nice that so many people came for us.
[31:40.380 --> 31:44.160]  Guys, I'm starting to think that maybe we should stream more than one hour every week.
[31:44.960 --> 31:46.340]  Well, now we have a fucking office.
[31:46.340 --> 31:48.400]  I wanted to keep going on that Pico Park level.
[31:48.580 --> 31:49.440]  Yeah, I did too.
[31:49.480 --> 31:50.160]  I didn't.
[31:50.160 --> 31:51.220]  I wanted to go until 8.01.
[31:51.440 --> 31:51.740]  No.
[31:52.560 --> 31:55.820]  Guys, I think it's time to pick up The Last of Us Part II MILF playthrough.
[31:55.980 --> 31:56.300]  Okay.
[31:56.660 --> 32:00.180]  I keep looking for a MILF mod and I can't find it, Nick.
[32:00.980 --> 32:01.900]  Thanks for checking.
[32:02.200 --> 32:02.780]  No problem.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.080]  Are there any modders out there that are good at MILFing?
[32:06.540 --> 32:07.340]  Yo, what's up?
[32:07.400 --> 32:08.100]  Any modders out there?
[32:08.180 --> 32:08.760]  MILF hens?
[32:08.960 --> 32:09.980]  Where my MILF hens at?
[32:10.960 --> 32:12.060]  Happy Mother's Day.
[32:17.740 --> 32:20.080]  Today really would have been the day for the MILF playthrough.
[32:20.260 --> 32:20.960]  It would have been.
[32:20.980 --> 32:22.980]  Zap 3150 with 50 gifted subs.
[32:23.000 --> 32:23.700]  Oh my God.
[32:24.000 --> 32:24.460]  Jesus.
[32:24.740 --> 32:25.900]  Oh my God.
[32:25.940 --> 32:27.340]  Zap 3150?
[32:27.500 --> 32:27.720]  Yep.
[32:28.480 --> 32:28.920]  Legend.
[32:29.440 --> 32:30.000]  Legend.
[32:30.000 --> 32:30.940]  Thank you so much.
[32:31.480 --> 32:31.780]  Hey!
[32:32.900 --> 32:34.040]  This is crazy.
[32:34.320 --> 32:37.260]  So what's with all like the PlayStation symbols flying around Bowser?
[32:37.960 --> 32:38.460]  Oh.
[32:39.060 --> 32:39.840]  Hit him and Kamek.
[32:39.920 --> 32:40.560]  They love PlayStation.
[32:42.780 --> 32:44.940]  I guess it's imposter Bowser, so it makes sense.
[32:44.940 --> 32:46.480]  Here we go.
[32:50.800 --> 32:51.800]  Where's the new star?
[32:52.180 --> 32:53.320]  Andrew's coming up on boot.
[32:54.100 --> 32:54.760]  Uh-oh.
[32:55.620 --> 32:56.500]  All right, here we go.
[32:56.540 --> 32:57.040]  Double the coins.
[32:58.140 --> 32:59.040]  On turn five.
[33:00.380 --> 33:01.200]  Killer monkey, thank you.
[33:01.200 --> 33:02.160]  One coin away, too.
[33:02.160 --> 33:04.880]  All right, this will be the last turn before we have a sit-down.
[33:05.040 --> 33:05.900]  Hot, hot, hot.
[33:07.800 --> 33:08.980]  Whoa, 20 coins.
[33:09.440 --> 33:10.660]  Was that, I think, Sinuja?
[33:11.760 --> 33:12.360]  What's that?
[33:14.140 --> 33:15.480]  Do we have something like that?
[33:15.480 --> 33:16.060]  Yeah.
[33:16.440 --> 33:17.260]  Hot hoof.
[33:18.360 --> 33:19.160]  Hot foot.
[33:19.320 --> 33:20.720]  Come on, you little rat.
[33:20.800 --> 33:21.140]  Hit the button.
[33:21.520 --> 33:22.340]  Hop till you...
[33:22.820 --> 33:23.800]  Hop till you shop.
[33:25.140 --> 33:26.120]  Shop till you hop.
[33:27.420 --> 33:27.820]  Here we go.
[33:28.680 --> 33:31.800]  If we ever redo an Achievement City walkthrough,
[33:32.040 --> 33:35.460]  we should do it live and have the audience tell us what everything was that we built.
[33:38.620 --> 33:39.740]  What was this?
[33:39.840 --> 33:40.280]  Oh, they know.
[33:41.100 --> 33:44.620]  There's like a weird gap in my memory where it's like after I stopped editing,
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.620]  so it's like 120...
[33:46.220 --> 33:46.680]  Shit!
[33:48.060 --> 33:50.700]  You were too locked in on nostalgia.
[33:50.700 --> 33:51.900]  I was ready to jump that thing.
[33:51.980 --> 33:52.600]  I just did it.
[33:53.080 --> 33:54.260]  Oh, there goes Dilcom.
[33:54.640 --> 33:55.500]  Dil's down.
[33:56.580 --> 33:57.340]  Dil down.
[33:57.700 --> 33:58.000]  Oh, God.
[33:59.880 --> 34:00.420]  No!
[34:02.220 --> 34:02.920]  The mole!
[34:03.240 --> 34:03.720]  No!
[34:04.500 --> 34:07.700]  There he is, his little fucking tooth.
[34:07.780 --> 34:08.620]  Monty Mole.
[34:08.620 --> 34:08.880]  Monty Mole.
[34:12.260 --> 34:15.120]  Let's see where we stand before we have our sit-down.
[34:15.380 --> 34:18.020]  Because we are two minutes away from everything going on sale.
[34:19.080 --> 34:19.880]  Nick, are you ready?
[34:20.160 --> 34:20.460]  Yeah!
[34:21.580 --> 34:22.460]  You want me to hop over there?
[34:22.800 --> 34:25.140]  Yeah, just, I mean, you can just take it to the full screen.
[34:25.260 --> 34:25.560]  Yeah!
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.300]  And then you can come and have a sit down as Gavin suggested.
[34:28.740 --> 34:30.360]  Nick, can you mute my urination?
[34:31.440 --> 34:32.280]  Two seconds, hold on.
[34:32.300 --> 34:33.220]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[34:35.300 --> 34:35.620]  Wait!
[34:36.120 --> 34:36.600]  Which one's Gavin?
[34:36.600 --> 34:37.280]  Gavin, talk!
[34:37.500 --> 34:38.280]  Hello, I'm Nick!
[34:41.620 --> 34:44.020]  Guys, regulationstore.com, regulationstore.store.
[34:44.460 --> 34:46.620]  Andrew, are you ready for everything to go on sale?
[34:46.620 --> 34:48.040]  I'm ready, I'm so...
[34:48.040 --> 34:48.720]  Let me...
[34:48.720 --> 34:50.140]  Rev my wheels, I'm so ready.
[34:50.260 --> 34:50.820]  I'm so excited.
[34:50.820 --> 34:52.200]  Oh, he's revving, guys, he's revving!
[34:52.420 --> 34:53.000]  Rev it, Andrew!
[34:54.940 --> 34:55.580]  I'm revving!
[34:56.180 --> 34:56.960]  Oh, my brain!
[34:59.740 --> 35:01.060]  Look at him go, guys.
[35:01.180 --> 35:01.500]  Look at my hair.
[35:01.720 --> 35:02.140]  All right, ready?
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.460]  Go, attack, attack, attack!
[35:03.460 --> 35:05.740]  Ow, ow, ow, ow!
[35:05.900 --> 35:07.840]  Thanks for stealing my coin, you fool!
[35:09.040 --> 35:10.580]  You stole from me!
[35:11.500 --> 35:12.240]  Oh, my God.
[35:13.200 --> 35:19.020]  Regulationstore.com, regulationstore.store is where you're going to want to head in just a minute.
[35:19.140 --> 35:21.660]  Don't forget, Rady Boy shirts on sale.
[35:21.860 --> 35:29.460]  And, if you've noticed, the banner at the top of the store page in look of Velcro...
[35:30.040 --> 35:30.460]  Oh!
[35:30.460 --> 35:39.300]  ...for the Pat shirt, because El Famoso, Cody and that team over there, have been doing a great job sort of keeping an eye on the store, customizing...
[35:39.300 --> 35:40.440]  Dude, they're the best.
[35:40.460 --> 35:41.100]  Nice catch.
[35:41.740 --> 35:42.500]  They're awesome.
[35:42.760 --> 35:47.780]  And you can see Graham and everyone else over there in the video where Geoff started recording Graham first.
[35:49.820 --> 35:50.620]  You good?
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.500]  Hey, I'm done pissing, Nick.
[35:52.640 --> 35:52.840]  Okay.
[35:52.920 --> 35:53.700]  All right, you're back on.
[35:53.760 --> 35:54.240]  Thanks, Nick.
[35:54.360 --> 35:54.620]  You're welcome.
[35:54.620 --> 35:56.400]  Oh, Gavin's here for the sit-down, guys.
[35:56.620 --> 35:59.420]  Are you ready for regulationstore.com or regulationstore.store?
[35:59.420 --> 36:00.520]  Okay, you're funny.
[36:00.680 --> 36:01.060]  You're funny.
[36:02.160 --> 36:02.600]  Bitch!
[36:02.780 --> 36:04.140]  This hat just crashed into my arm!
[36:05.080 --> 36:06.280]  This is my chair now!
[36:06.540 --> 36:07.180]  This is mine!
[36:07.980 --> 36:09.460]  Regulationstore.com is live!
[36:10.620 --> 36:12.260]  Wow, you stuck the landing on me.
[36:12.280 --> 36:23.260]  That's the Pat shirt, the Patch, the Koozler, the Idiot Pennant, the Rady Boy shirts, and the restock of the regulation shirt on sale now.
[36:23.600 --> 36:24.880]  Go get it.
[36:25.040 --> 36:27.820]  I don't think these things are going to sell out in like two minutes.
[36:27.820 --> 36:29.460]  No, we ordered a lot of inventory.
[36:30.080 --> 36:32.620]  We tried to get a lot of inventory. Thank you, Nick.
[36:32.940 --> 36:33.080]  You're welcome.
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.700]  We tried to get a lot of inventory for this stuff, so try not to crash it.
[36:37.880 --> 36:39.280]  Why would you say that, though?
[36:39.540 --> 36:41.000]  Because I don't think it's going to crash.
[36:41.060 --> 36:41.280]  Okay.
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.460]  Gavin, I guarantee it will not crash.
[36:45.600 --> 36:46.040]  He said it.
[36:47.960 --> 36:48.820]  Let me check.
[36:49.320 --> 36:49.960]  Okay, we're good.
[36:52.300 --> 36:53.820]  Regulationstore.store, still working.
[36:54.160 --> 36:54.580]  Hell yeah!
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.520]  And then also, you see the banner?
[36:55.900 --> 36:56.400]  That looks great.
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.680]  It's all velcro-y.
[36:58.060 --> 36:58.340]  Wow!
[36:59.080 --> 36:59.860]  It's really cool with the tape.
[37:00.280 --> 37:03.020]  The Idiot Pennant is so much better in real life than I imagined.
[37:03.040 --> 37:03.560]  It's awesome.
[37:03.760 --> 37:12.860]  And the thing we didn't talk about is if you go to regulationstore.com, you'll see the little golden show asterisk.
[37:13.300 --> 37:15.800]  That's the sticker that you get with your order.
[37:16.040 --> 37:21.920]  We did a special different look sticker for this round, and you'll get that sticker with this order.
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.480]  So grab a patch, grab a patch shirt, grab a... ratty boy shirt.
[37:27.320 --> 37:28.940]  Get the Koozler, the Idiot Pennant.
[37:29.200 --> 37:30.280]  Let everyone know you're an idiot.
[37:30.780 --> 37:33.000]  Now, ratty boy shirt, that's something we definitely wouldn't sell.
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.160]  Geoff kept giving us numbers of how many we sold, and I just kept going, that's too many.
[37:38.560 --> 37:39.380]  We do less.
[37:39.460 --> 37:40.180]  When does yours get here?
[37:41.760 --> 37:42.880]  Oh, mine's in the trash.
[37:43.200 --> 37:43.700]  Oh, yeah.
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.380]  Yeah, no problem.
[37:44.560 --> 37:44.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:45.080 --> 37:46.600]  I'm not going to wear a ratty boy shirt.
[37:46.760 --> 37:48.700]  Okay, a lot of people in the chat saying, acquired.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.600]  Yeah, let us know what merch you'd like to see.
[37:52.280 --> 37:55.300]  Got a Koozler and a patch, sweet deal, thanks for Explosion.
[37:55.820 --> 37:56.860]  Appreciate you guys.
[37:57.720 --> 37:58.480]  This is awesome.
[37:59.080 --> 38:00.920]  The Idiot Pennant looks awesome.
[38:01.140 --> 38:02.480]  I'm going to put... is this camera still on?
[38:02.980 --> 38:03.600]  Oh, yeah, it should be.
[38:03.880 --> 38:05.580]  I got to flip to it if you want to use it.
[38:05.580 --> 38:10.700]  I'm just going to have it be so that if Andrew's doing anything, we can just have an Andrew cam.
[38:12.160 --> 38:12.740]  Here he comes.
[38:13.780 --> 38:14.380]  Look at him go.
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.560]  Here comes Andrew, here comes Andrew.
[38:16.580 --> 38:19.600]  Okay, he's getting... it looks like he's getting mad.
[38:20.300 --> 38:21.860]  It's just like Andrew's little arena.
[38:22.880 --> 38:23.520]  Arena cam.
[38:23.720 --> 38:25.700]  How does that control, Andrew? Do you like it?
[38:25.860 --> 38:26.940]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[38:27.060 --> 38:31.120]  It's weird, you can't turn without going forward, so it makes turning a little awkward.
[38:31.200 --> 38:31.860]  Oh, that's tough.
[38:32.860 --> 38:35.840]  The way he's just talking and it cuts to his little face.
[38:35.940 --> 38:36.840]  Let me do my little thing here.
[38:36.940 --> 38:38.720]  Let me, you know, if I'm going to talk, let me face you guys.
[38:38.800 --> 38:39.560]  I'm face to face here.
[38:40.020 --> 38:41.160]  Yeah, it works pretty well.
[38:41.260 --> 38:42.600]  Overall, I'd say pretty good.
[38:43.720 --> 38:44.380]  No points.
[38:47.300 --> 38:49.220]  Oh, let me try an action.
[38:50.080 --> 38:50.560]  Okay.
[38:54.320 --> 38:54.800]  Uh...
[38:54.800 --> 38:56.680]  Sewing machine! I'm sewing machine!
[38:56.940 --> 38:58.100]  I'm going left, they're going right!
[38:58.920 --> 38:59.940]  I remember that!
[39:00.060 --> 39:01.200]  Bam, bam! Bam, bam!
[39:01.820 --> 39:03.460]  It's not the sewing machine.
[39:03.620 --> 39:04.140]  Sewing machine!
[39:04.380 --> 39:06.060]  It's not the sewing machine.
[39:06.080 --> 39:07.080]  One foot in, one foot out!
[39:11.300 --> 39:13.240]  How close to the camera could you get, Andrew?
[39:13.480 --> 39:14.040]  Oh, one sec.
[39:16.820 --> 39:19.200]  Sold out of the patch by itself.
[39:19.200 --> 39:20.680]  Oh, shit.
[39:20.700 --> 39:21.100]  Oh, really?
[39:21.240 --> 39:23.520]  Yeah, we ordered extra patches just in case.
[39:23.580 --> 39:25.220]  We are sold out of the patch by itself.
[39:25.400 --> 39:27.500]  Look at how he looks so stupid.
[39:27.680 --> 39:29.820]  Go to regulation store!
[39:34.180 --> 39:35.240]  No, no, no, no!
[39:35.320 --> 39:36.060]  No, no, no!
[39:36.440 --> 39:38.040]  He's crashing into the camera.
[39:38.760 --> 39:39.540]  He hates the gimbal.
[39:40.540 --> 39:41.900]  Only one robot in it.
[39:41.960 --> 39:42.740]  His ability to go...
[39:42.740 --> 39:44.340]  I gotta run and get my shirt!
[39:44.340 --> 39:46.020]  Get out of the way!
[39:49.300 --> 39:52.660]  He was about to crash into Nick's Dr. Pepper.
[39:52.780 --> 39:54.400]  He had to immediately evade.
[39:54.520 --> 39:55.200]  Hey, good move.
[39:55.680 --> 39:56.100]  Where'd he go?
[39:56.280 --> 39:56.780]  Oh, there he is.
[39:56.960 --> 39:58.900]  We're definitely building a maze for him.
[39:58.980 --> 39:59.280]  Right?
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.220]  We have to.
[40:01.060 --> 40:03.760]  You can spill a drink from a country away.
[40:05.680 --> 40:08.140]  Attack a friend, spill a drink, whatever it takes.
[40:08.760 --> 40:09.980]  Guys, this is awesome.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.380]  Thank you for supporting us.
[40:11.920 --> 40:13.940]  Regulationstore.com where all that merch is on sale.
[40:14.460 --> 40:15.880]  Andrew is going to go hide?
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.680]  Hey, you know how they have those live streams of animals in their habitat?
[40:21.860 --> 40:25.240]  Why don't we just keep the camera on this thing at all times while we're gone?
[40:25.840 --> 40:27.200]  And Andrew can log in and move.
[40:27.420 --> 40:29.600]  I think it would just be Andrew trying to unplug the camera.
[40:32.040 --> 40:33.960]  Andrew, try and turn the stream off.
[40:34.760 --> 40:37.740]  Do you want to know where the top location of sales is from right now?
[40:37.840 --> 40:38.180]  Yes.
[40:38.940 --> 40:39.840]  Chicago, Illinois.
[40:40.240 --> 40:40.640]  Wow!
[40:41.180 --> 40:42.420]  The pope town of the pope?
[40:42.420 --> 40:43.880]  Well, number two is Atlanta.
[40:44.200 --> 40:45.240]  Yeah, they're spending that pope money.
[40:45.720 --> 40:45.900]  Damn.
[40:46.080 --> 40:46.760]  That's awesome.
[40:48.940 --> 40:50.580]  Oh, sold out of the Koozler.
[40:50.840 --> 40:51.360]  Oh, wow.
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.000]  Sold out of the restock on the Koozler.
[40:53.260 --> 40:53.900]  But the shirt's still going?
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.360]  Yeah, the shirt is still going.
[40:55.480 --> 40:57.020]  The Idiot Pendant is still going.
[40:57.180 --> 40:59.560]  That's at least, what, five minutes of selling a shirt?
[41:00.020 --> 41:02.200]  Regulation T restock is still going.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.960]  Shockingly, both Ratty Boy shirts still available.
[41:06.840 --> 41:07.280]  Amazing.
[41:09.160 --> 41:10.380]  I can't believe it.
[41:12.420 --> 41:15.420]  The Koozler surprises me every time we put it on sale, Geoff.
[41:16.120 --> 41:17.240]  I know, I know.
[41:17.640 --> 41:20.760]  Listen, we've got a hint on our hands and we might as well just acknowledge it.
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.240]  I feel like...
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.840]  We can't believe people buy it, but people buy it.
[41:25.920 --> 41:28.260]  Every time we put it on sale, it's me and Geoff going,
[41:28.600 --> 41:30.580]  I mean, we'll just, we'll throw it up there.
[41:30.700 --> 41:31.780]  Like, no one really cares.
[41:31.920 --> 41:33.360]  And then they go, yeah, the Koozler sold out.
[41:33.400 --> 41:34.020]  We should make more.
[41:34.140 --> 41:35.800]  And it's like, should we?
[41:35.920 --> 41:36.120]  Really?
[41:36.340 --> 41:38.220]  This is the second time it's happened.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.500]  I think we just have to...
[41:39.940 --> 41:40.180]  Oh!
[41:40.260 --> 41:40.580]  Okay.
[41:41.660 --> 41:42.380]  Sorry, sorry.
[41:42.460 --> 41:43.200]  Didn't mean to do that.
[41:43.440 --> 41:44.720]  Andrew, can you hold my drink for me?
[41:44.940 --> 41:45.580]  Oh my God.
[41:45.720 --> 41:45.840]  What's that?
[41:47.080 --> 41:47.440]  Okay.
[41:47.840 --> 41:48.580]  Okay, got it.
[41:49.440 --> 41:49.800]  Okay.
[41:50.420 --> 41:51.780]  Do you mean to take it somewhere?
[41:51.940 --> 41:53.080]  Is it empty or...?
[41:53.080 --> 41:54.000]  Just, just, uh...
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.180]  Show the camera what he was drinking.
[41:55.400 --> 41:55.900]  Show it to the camera.
[41:56.000 --> 41:56.860]  Just don't spill it, yeah?
[41:57.040 --> 41:57.220]  Okay.
[41:58.060 --> 41:58.780]  Oh no!
[41:58.880 --> 41:59.900]  It spilled on Nick's iPad!
[42:01.020 --> 42:01.380]  Immediately.
[42:03.400 --> 42:04.120]  God dammit!
[42:04.240 --> 42:05.100]  Andrew gave up.
[42:05.300 --> 42:05.780]  Wait, wait.
[42:05.800 --> 42:06.500]  Andrew gave up.
[42:07.420 --> 42:08.100]  They didn't see nothing.
[42:08.260 --> 42:08.940]  They didn't see nothing.
[42:09.100 --> 42:09.760]  They didn't see nothing.
[42:11.620 --> 42:12.780]  They didn't see nothing!
[42:12.780 --> 42:13.280]  You're running into the camera!
[42:13.860 --> 42:15.680]  He's taking down his camera again.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.140]  They didn't see nothing!
[42:17.340 --> 42:18.060]  You're running into me!
[42:18.140 --> 42:19.080]  They got no feed!
[42:19.300 --> 42:19.420]  Oh!
[42:19.980 --> 42:21.100]  If, uh...
[42:21.100 --> 42:24.560]  While we're sitting down with you guys for the next few minutes,
[42:24.840 --> 42:27.620]  if anybody has any questions or anything about the last year,
[42:27.720 --> 42:28.500]  or the next year,
[42:28.580 --> 42:29.220]  or the office,
[42:29.420 --> 42:30.620]  or what we're going to do with it,
[42:30.740 --> 42:33.100]  or what we're going to do with each other...
[42:33.620 --> 42:34.120]  God, Andrew.
[42:34.120 --> 42:36.160]  What we're going to do to each other...
[42:37.060 --> 42:38.180]  It's so responsive.
[42:38.220 --> 42:39.080]  Don't unplug the stream!
[42:40.220 --> 42:41.520]  Stop! It's my laptop.
[42:42.500 --> 42:43.940]  You know, the next iteration of this,
[42:44.020 --> 42:45.720]  it comes with a little claw that Andrew got.
[42:46.120 --> 42:47.800]  What if we put some scissors on the front of him
[42:47.800 --> 42:49.060]  so he can snip things that he wants?
[42:49.700 --> 42:50.180]  Please, no.
[42:51.260 --> 42:53.360]  There's a lot of cables around here.
[42:53.920 --> 42:56.300]  What was the biggest flop from regulation so far?
[42:57.060 --> 42:57.860]  Biggest flop?
[42:58.040 --> 42:59.340]  Oh, uh, the clock.
[43:00.820 --> 43:02.000]  Well, that was fuckface.
[43:02.160 --> 43:03.180]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[43:03.300 --> 43:03.900]  Maybe, uh...
[43:04.800 --> 43:05.560]  The first office.
[43:07.920 --> 43:08.680]  Blessing in disguise.
[43:08.680 --> 43:10.720]  Andrew's first attempt at recording a Ratty Boy.
[43:10.720 --> 43:12.140]  Yeah, Ratty. I'd say Ratty Boy.
[43:12.860 --> 43:13.920]  Ratty Boy's never a flop.
[43:15.920 --> 43:16.320]  Hey.
[43:17.500 --> 43:20.340]  I think we need an Eric Head and Hands emote.
[43:20.860 --> 43:21.240]  We can do that.
[43:21.300 --> 43:21.760]  I'm good.
[43:22.120 --> 43:22.820]  You looking up at me?
[43:23.060 --> 43:23.800]  You take that back!
[43:24.220 --> 43:25.560]  Ratty Boy's never a flop!
[43:27.360 --> 43:28.500]  This is ridiculous.
[43:29.140 --> 43:31.120]  Can you see what country is buying the most?
[43:31.260 --> 43:31.440]  Maybe.
[43:31.640 --> 43:31.900]  Okay, I'm stuck.
[43:33.540 --> 43:34.660]  Typically, it's USA.
[43:35.180 --> 43:35.460]  Thank you.
[43:35.620 --> 43:36.500]  Looks like America.
[43:40.740 --> 43:41.080]  Uh...
[43:41.080 --> 43:42.600]  I wish I could dial...
[43:42.600 --> 43:43.460]  If I was smarter, I could.
[43:43.860 --> 43:47.320]  I remember for the last podcast, I wanted to have an area of the site called the Flop Zone.
[43:47.960 --> 43:50.500]  Where we would just put all the stuff that we just sucked at selling.
[43:51.500 --> 43:54.540]  So maybe Ratty Boy's shirt is the first entry in our new Flop Zone.
[43:54.620 --> 43:55.260]  That works for Ray.
[43:56.740 --> 43:58.520]  Andrew versus Roomba balloon fight.
[43:59.460 --> 44:01.160]  Was that a howl?
[44:01.420 --> 44:03.500]  Yeah, he did that to me while I was setting up earlier.
[44:04.020 --> 44:05.760]  Is this like a werewolf situation?
[44:05.760 --> 44:06.540]  We got that wolf.
[44:06.820 --> 44:09.600]  You don't want to be in this office when it's a full moon.
[44:13.660 --> 44:16.160]  I love the idea of Andrew Pot being a werewolf.
[44:17.480 --> 44:18.340]  Oh, man.
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.320]  What's the most important thing for us having an office?
[44:23.380 --> 44:27.560]  I think it's being together, being able to do stuff like this.
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.080]  Filming together, not having to be in Geoff's kitchen.
[44:30.620 --> 44:32.920]  Yeah, we were really hampered on what we could film.
[44:32.920 --> 44:37.220]  My new home isn't suited for it, but also I don't own it.
[44:37.860 --> 44:40.220]  And we've already put hot dogs on the fan.
[44:40.620 --> 44:42.620]  And took a door off a hinge.
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.360]  I think my favorite thing about all being in the office is that we can just come here even if we don't plan to...
[44:47.860 --> 44:48.460]  Andrew's howling.
[44:48.960 --> 44:55.400]  Even if we don't plan on filming something, we can just shoot the shit and we'll often come up with two or three ideas just from standing around in the same room.
[44:55.560 --> 44:56.380]  They've been really good.
[44:56.600 --> 45:00.700]  It's been a lot of fun to have a place to come to for this.
[45:00.760 --> 45:02.240]  Because we've had that for 100% Eat.
[45:02.240 --> 45:06.200]  We've had an office where we get together and it is like...
[45:06.200 --> 45:09.520]  Oh, we can shift into gear and it's easier to get into that mode.
[45:09.820 --> 45:11.220]  This is gonna have that now.
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.580]  And I'm really excited, especially now that we have Robot Andrew.
[45:14.380 --> 45:16.320]  Ooh, thanks for all the subs, Dirk Strongwood.
[45:16.880 --> 45:17.500]  Thank you!
[45:17.520 --> 45:19.520]  I think we're gonna drink a lot more coffee together.
[45:19.640 --> 45:20.340]  Hell yeah!
[45:21.320 --> 45:22.360]  And a lot more hot dogs.
[45:22.580 --> 45:23.200]  Hell yeah!
[45:23.340 --> 45:24.280]  Hot dog number's up.
[45:24.420 --> 45:26.200]  Is the Break Show coming back? Absolutely.
[45:26.640 --> 45:26.760]  Okay.
[45:28.900 --> 45:31.720]  But it'll likely be under a different name, so don't...
[45:32.360 --> 45:33.800]  Kweefer Sutherland, 5 Gifted.
[45:33.960 --> 45:36.200]  I think I'm gonna call it the Regulation Closet.
[45:36.400 --> 45:37.020]  That's pretty good.
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.520]  Let's see what's in the Regulation Closet today.
[45:39.680 --> 45:40.320]  Oh, I like that.
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.560]  We did a little tour, a little live action tour at the beginning of the show where we showed off the office.
[45:45.000 --> 45:45.880]  And we'll put that up later.
[45:46.320 --> 45:47.940]  The VOD of all this will go up later.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.080]  But there is a room that'll be the Break Room.
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.000]  And there's a room that's just my show with Nick.
[45:53.360 --> 45:54.180]  Yeah, dude!
[45:54.200 --> 45:55.700]  That's actually more than a room. It's like half the house.
[45:55.780 --> 45:56.260]  Yeah, no kidding.
[45:57.080 --> 45:59.560]  Jslit, thank you. 20 Gifted. Appreciate you.
[46:00.080 --> 46:00.860]  Thank you so much.
[46:00.860 --> 46:03.460]  Well, do you guys want to get back to some Mario Party?
[46:03.800 --> 46:03.980]  Yeah.
[46:04.380 --> 46:05.960]  Is Emily coming back for the Break Show? I would assume so.
[46:06.020 --> 46:07.960]  I assume Eric and Emily and whoever else is gonna be in it.
[46:08.000 --> 46:09.900]  Oh, I just remembered I'm like so busy, dude.
[46:10.840 --> 46:11.500]  Definitely Eric.
[46:13.880 --> 46:14.240]  Alright.
[46:14.940 --> 46:16.700]  How's the shirt? Still for sale?
[46:16.860 --> 46:17.540]  Let's make sure.
[46:17.560 --> 46:18.180]  Let me see.
[46:18.900 --> 46:19.680]  Let's make sure.
[46:20.240 --> 46:21.420]  Pat's shirt, still for sale.
[46:21.580 --> 46:22.020]  Hell yeah!
[46:22.500 --> 46:24.080]  Idiot Pennant, still on sale.
[46:24.980 --> 46:26.320]  Shockingly, both Ratty Boy shirts.
[46:26.340 --> 46:28.420]  We may have finally learned how to sell a shirt.
[46:28.480 --> 46:30.700]  And Regulation Podcast, on sale still.
[46:30.700 --> 46:32.220]  We haven't learned how to sell a Gerpler yet.
[46:32.700 --> 46:33.660]  We've learned the shirt.
[46:33.820 --> 46:36.300]  But, stay tuned because we'll have Gerpler news soon.
[46:36.600 --> 46:37.320]  Gerpler news!
[46:37.420 --> 46:38.880]  No Gerplers today.
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.480]  Even though some, maybe one-fifth of this company thought there were Gerplers today.
[46:43.660 --> 46:44.260]  Yeah, I had to cut that.
[46:44.600 --> 46:45.160]  Thank you.
[46:45.740 --> 46:46.200]  In the episode.
[46:48.980 --> 46:49.380]  Ridiculous.
[46:49.380 --> 46:50.240]  Who did that?
[46:51.220 --> 46:51.620]  Ridiculous.
[46:51.960 --> 46:52.360]  Ridiculous.
[46:52.560 --> 46:52.960]  Who did that?
[46:53.180 --> 46:54.820]  Best Bet 25 Gifted, thank you.
[46:54.900 --> 46:55.960]  But Gerplers, soon.
[46:56.200 --> 46:56.860]  Sooner than later.
[46:57.040 --> 46:57.240]  Yeah.
[46:57.520 --> 46:58.360]  They'll be in the next few months.
[46:58.440 --> 46:59.300]  Yep, so stay tuned.
[46:59.300 --> 47:00.340]  We'll have more.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.220]  Oh, what if he carries it now?
[47:05.360 --> 47:06.340]  We can't see it.
[47:06.460 --> 47:08.160]  Oh, right. Well, never mind.
[47:08.420 --> 47:10.360]  Alright, let's go back into some Mario Party.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.700]  Should I fuck this bitch up? Let's do it.
[47:12.020 --> 47:13.160]  Thanks to everyone who got a shirt.
[47:13.280 --> 47:14.560]  Thank you so much.
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.140]  Or a patch, or a pin-in.
[47:16.200 --> 47:16.740]  Thank you!
[47:17.080 --> 47:17.640]  A sub.
[47:17.840 --> 47:18.180]  Yeah!
[47:18.860 --> 47:22.200]  Or if you were saving bucks to resubscribe, whatever you need to do.
[47:22.220 --> 47:23.540]  Thank you to anybody who resubscribed.
[47:23.640 --> 47:25.560]  Thank you to anybody who's decided to subscribe.
[47:25.960 --> 47:26.220]  Yeah!
[47:26.220 --> 47:29.020]  Five gifted subs. Putin on the Ritz.
[47:35.950 --> 47:37.070]  Oh, you're iteming?
[47:37.230 --> 47:37.610]  Here we go.
[47:37.930 --> 47:38.930]  Oh, I'm just taking a look around.
[47:39.010 --> 47:40.250]  Looking at the board.
[47:41.730 --> 47:43.090]  Oh, look at that.
[47:43.810 --> 47:46.290]  Pigeon Studios Jen asking if they can buy just the patch.
[47:46.410 --> 47:47.490]  You could, but it's sold out.
[47:48.250 --> 47:50.830]  But there will definitely be more patches. Obviously you're gonna want...
[47:50.830 --> 47:53.230]  There will be more patches, so stay tuned.
[47:53.310 --> 47:55.150]  We'll have more information on what we're doing next soon.
[47:55.250 --> 47:56.130]  We should order those patches.
[47:56.690 --> 47:58.190]  That is a Monday problem.
[47:58.190 --> 48:01.770]  And as time goes on, there'll be more to do with that shirt.
[48:01.930 --> 48:02.230]  Uh-huh.
[48:03.010 --> 48:04.350]  It's a solid base.
[48:04.550 --> 48:07.310]  The thing about the patch shirt is that it's always upgradeable.
[48:07.410 --> 48:08.390]  New downloadable content.
[48:08.810 --> 48:08.990]  No!
[48:09.110 --> 48:09.850]  Oh, Nick!
[48:10.330 --> 48:10.990]  Oh, no!
[48:11.070 --> 48:11.530]  Oh, no!
[48:12.510 --> 48:14.750]  You're so tiny in this big manly hand.
[48:14.810 --> 48:16.150]  Oh, what's gonna happen?
[48:17.010 --> 48:18.270]  He's gonna have his way with you.
[48:19.330 --> 48:20.130]  One star.
[48:20.310 --> 48:20.910]  This is just like one of those...
[48:21.630 --> 48:22.430]  20 coins!
[48:23.810 --> 48:24.630]  You can still buy it.
[48:24.790 --> 48:25.010]  Yup.
[48:25.870 --> 48:26.770]  Yeah, I can still buy it.
[48:26.770 --> 48:28.510]  You look like you pissed those coins out.
[48:29.950 --> 48:31.430]  Oh, he squeezed me real hard.
[48:31.590 --> 48:32.090]  Oh, he's three.
[48:32.270 --> 48:32.590]  Ah!
[48:33.210 --> 48:33.610]  Chucked you.
[48:34.990 --> 48:35.310]  Discarded.
[48:35.610 --> 48:36.430]  Oh, you little booboo.
[48:36.450 --> 48:36.910]  What a jerk.
[48:37.850 --> 48:39.070]  At least you're gonna get sucked into his hand.
[48:39.070 --> 48:40.870]  Oh, yeah, Andrew is missing from the arm of the couch.
[48:42.330 --> 48:43.390]  We gotta get all five of us here.
[48:43.390 --> 48:44.010]  Oh, get me back up.
[48:44.190 --> 48:44.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, thanks.
[48:44.830 --> 48:45.630]  Yeah, dude, yeah, we got you.
[48:45.670 --> 48:46.070]  You had a problem.
[48:47.990 --> 48:49.010]  20 to the star?
[48:50.650 --> 48:51.230]  Good lord.
[48:51.530 --> 48:53.170]  Will I ever get off this?
[48:53.410 --> 48:53.670]  Nope.
[48:55.130 --> 48:55.690]  Get off.
[48:55.690 --> 48:56.730]  Could switch the direction.
[48:57.010 --> 48:58.130]  Maybe I can hit up this door again.
[48:59.370 --> 49:00.710]  With a nice eight.
[49:01.850 --> 49:02.630]  Where's this door?
[49:04.710 --> 49:05.970]  Oh, where is this door?
[49:06.330 --> 49:06.390]  Four coins.
[49:06.390 --> 49:07.230]  I got bad news for you.
[49:07.290 --> 49:07.970]  Oh, shit.
[49:07.970 --> 49:08.730]  Oh, no!
[49:10.050 --> 49:10.870]  Mother of shit.
[49:12.350 --> 49:13.230]  Uh-oh.
[49:14.250 --> 49:15.970]  Son of a...
[49:15.970 --> 49:17.190]  Hey, thanks for unlocking this.
[49:17.330 --> 49:17.990]  Yeah, no worries, man.
[49:18.970 --> 49:21.430]  Hey, you guys, we haven't even seen the level.
[49:21.650 --> 49:23.070]  I've just seen this square.
[49:23.070 --> 49:27.010]  I have a feeling that this square is the level.
[49:27.590 --> 49:28.150]  Yeah, no kidding.
[49:29.030 --> 49:30.870]  This is just, like, saw of the level.
[49:31.030 --> 49:35.090]  If this was Mario Party March, we would have spent an entire week in this freaking square.
[49:37.210 --> 49:39.350]  Oh, we might be on a team, I think, in this turn, Geffen.
[49:40.450 --> 49:41.250]  What's our team name?
[49:43.290 --> 49:43.650]  Gik.
[49:48.430 --> 49:48.790]  Nappy.
[49:51.290 --> 49:52.010]  Oh, boy.
[49:52.010 --> 49:53.350]  How about Nag?
[49:56.230 --> 49:57.730]  Nag, Nag, Nag.
[49:58.270 --> 49:59.250]  International incident.
[49:59.950 --> 50:00.950]  I know what you should do.
[50:01.610 --> 50:02.450]  Oh, so good.
[50:02.950 --> 50:03.630]  I'm doing random.
[50:04.410 --> 50:05.310]  Shadow Alliance.
[50:05.590 --> 50:06.230]  I'm doing random.
[50:06.230 --> 50:08.010]  Don't break the Shadow Alliance.
[50:08.930 --> 50:09.890]  No, don't random it.
[50:10.090 --> 50:10.890]  Oh, you worthless.
[50:11.230 --> 50:11.730]  Yeah!
[50:12.110 --> 50:14.410]  You just called me worthless and I didn't even take it from you.
[50:14.430 --> 50:14.890]  No, I love you.
[50:17.430 --> 50:19.190]  I'm so proud of you right now.
[50:19.370 --> 50:20.330]  So proud of you.
[50:20.750 --> 50:21.070]  Random.
[50:22.550 --> 50:24.390]  Gavin, that was an attack. I hit random.
[50:26.370 --> 50:27.970]  The attack was when he landed on your knee.
[50:27.970 --> 50:29.710]  The attack was when you didn't just press Nick.
[50:29.850 --> 50:31.350]  Oh, I see that as an attack.
[50:34.090 --> 50:34.410]  Tough.
[50:34.570 --> 50:35.450]  He still feels that way.
[50:39.250 --> 50:41.630]  Andrew, look, if you give me my star back, I won't...
[50:41.630 --> 50:43.130]  Oh, I have a feeling it'll come back to you.
[50:45.490 --> 50:47.210]  Based on how the last time this game went.
[50:47.350 --> 50:49.610]  Oh, yeah, I'm just holding it for you. Keeping it warm.
[50:50.370 --> 50:51.670]  It's a rental star.
[50:51.790 --> 50:53.490]  That's six star steel.
[50:54.610 --> 50:56.130]  We're in the early game.
[50:56.330 --> 50:57.450]  What does the chain chomp do?
[50:58.210 --> 50:59.170]  Moves the star.
[50:59.870 --> 51:01.090]  Oh, okay.
[51:06.560 --> 51:07.920]  Where was Peach?
[51:08.560 --> 51:10.000]  She's at the top of the square.
[51:11.800 --> 51:13.000]  So we'll never see her.
[51:13.600 --> 51:14.140]  Dude, hell yeah.
[51:14.420 --> 51:15.900]  Mark the Frog bought an idiot pennant.
[51:16.180 --> 51:16.700]  Yeah!
[51:18.200 --> 51:19.100]  That's awesome.
[51:20.780 --> 51:23.040]  I love Mark the Frog so much.
[51:23.180 --> 51:26.900]  If you were around for Friday's stream, we played a game of Worms on top of Mark the Frog.
[51:28.340 --> 51:30.100]  And we blew up his eye a little bit.
[51:30.560 --> 51:34.180]  I don't know that Mark the Frog watches Twitch, the video.
[51:34.500 --> 51:35.960]  I think he just has the audio on.
[51:36.080 --> 51:39.280]  And then I think he does speech to text in the chat.
[51:40.460 --> 51:41.380]  While he's up to his elbows.
[51:43.560 --> 51:44.360]  So crazy.
[51:45.120 --> 51:45.480]  All right, Nick.
[51:46.160 --> 51:47.580]  Geoff, we got this.
[51:48.120 --> 51:49.260]  Do we? I mean, yeah.
[51:49.440 --> 51:50.160]  Yeah, we do.
[51:50.900 --> 51:51.800]  What is this one?
[51:52.020 --> 51:52.740]  Oh, no.
[51:53.460 --> 51:54.180]  Oh, God.
[51:54.980 --> 51:55.580]  We got it.
[51:55.640 --> 51:56.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got this.
[51:56.660 --> 51:57.440]  Yeah, you guys got it.
[51:57.820 --> 51:59.460]  We're dead.
[51:59.740 --> 52:01.100]  We'll just pull out really bad at these.
[52:01.860 --> 52:02.200]  Just so you know.
[52:02.680 --> 52:04.520]  Yeah, call the direction.
[52:04.680 --> 52:05.640]  You tell me when to go.
[52:05.720 --> 52:06.140]  I got a plan.
[52:06.300 --> 52:07.680]  Go slowly first and I'll go fast.
[52:10.640 --> 52:11.140]  Attacking him!
[52:12.240 --> 52:12.740]  Attacking him!
[52:14.000 --> 52:14.760]  What's the buzz?
[52:15.700 --> 52:16.860]  We're just moving, man.
[52:16.860 --> 52:17.980]  Why isn't it working for me?
[52:17.980 --> 52:18.880]  Andrew, I need you to go, too.
[52:19.520 --> 52:20.520]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[52:20.800 --> 52:21.780]  Keep going, Gavin!
[52:21.860 --> 52:22.900]  Why are we going over here?
[52:24.280 --> 52:25.120]  It's all you, Andrew.
[52:25.600 --> 52:26.960]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[52:27.260 --> 52:28.520]  Why are we doing wrong?
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.220]  It's spinning around.
[52:30.800 --> 52:32.000]  It's spinning, it's spinning, it's spinning.
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.180]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[52:34.180 --> 52:35.260]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[52:35.260 --> 52:36.200]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[52:36.400 --> 52:37.060]  So easy!
[52:37.940 --> 52:38.820]  Nick, I took a picture.
[52:39.380 --> 52:40.200]  I need to...
[52:40.200 --> 52:42.040]  You guys should go back and watch that.
[52:42.700 --> 52:44.820]  It's everyone doing this with two hands
[52:44.820 --> 52:48.940]  And Gavin is holding it with his left, like he's reeling in a fish.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.220]  I found this in the sofa cushion.
[52:51.380 --> 52:51.820]  Goddammit!
[52:53.060 --> 52:54.420]  Where did Andrew go?
[52:54.480 --> 52:55.560]  I'm under the couch!
[52:57.920 --> 53:01.100]  Gavin, you told me you'd tell me when I needed to do the thing.
[53:01.160 --> 53:03.200]  But I wasn't doing it even though I was doing it!
[53:04.600 --> 53:06.420]  You're all the way to the back?!
[53:06.420 --> 53:07.280]  I'm getting out!
[53:07.500 --> 53:09.040]  I don't know how I got here!
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.260]  Operation Rescue Andrew.
[53:14.260 --> 53:15.660]  Where'd he go?!
[53:15.660 --> 53:16.680]  What the fuck?!
[53:16.680 --> 53:17.560]  He keeps moving!
[53:17.700 --> 53:18.660]  To the front door?
[53:19.300 --> 53:21.260]  There we go. I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[53:22.180 --> 53:23.140]  I snagged him.
[53:23.900 --> 53:24.500]  Thank you!
[53:25.380 --> 53:26.440]  Oh my god.
[53:27.540 --> 53:29.360]  Smick Dibley gifted some!
[53:29.620 --> 53:30.460]  Thank you!
[53:33.720 --> 53:35.980]  Smick Dibley with the 50!
[53:36.880 --> 53:39.160]  Smick Dibley coming through big style!
[53:42.780 --> 53:43.220]  Smick Dibley!
[53:43.220 --> 53:43.720]  Smick Dibley!
[53:46.460 --> 53:51.920]  Oh, fuck me.
[53:54.180 --> 53:57.040]  Do it funny style.
[53:57.360 --> 53:57.960]  Yeah!
[53:59.240 --> 54:01.200]  I told you I was just keeping it warm!
[54:02.920 --> 54:04.540]  It's a complete rental!
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  One turn!
[54:06.340 --> 54:07.880]  One turn with my star.
[54:09.780 --> 54:11.380]  What a waste of 50 coins.
[54:11.860 --> 54:12.000]  Fuck.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.220]  Oh my god.
[54:17.440 --> 54:19.080]  Oh, this is a shot this time. Right there.
[54:24.320 --> 54:27.480]  Everything's still on sale except for the patch by itself.
[54:27.860 --> 54:30.520]  And the Kuzler. Those are sold out.
[54:30.520 --> 54:32.420]  Everything else on sale, regulationstore.com.
[54:32.540 --> 54:33.860]  Or regulationstore.store.
[54:34.900 --> 54:37.320]  After losing those 50 coins, I'm going to need an idiot flag.
[54:37.620 --> 54:38.420]  I'm ordering mine right now.
[54:39.080 --> 54:41.020]  Yeah, good. You and Mark the Frog.
[54:43.540 --> 54:43.980]  Sure.
[54:45.700 --> 54:48.920]  I can't believe we got a live first throw patch stick.
[54:49.220 --> 54:49.540]  Incredible.
[54:50.320 --> 54:51.740]  Took a couple tries.
[54:52.740 --> 54:53.600]  First time we did it.
[55:00.940 --> 55:01.500]  Alright.
[55:06.360 --> 55:07.740]  What are you thinking?
[55:08.280 --> 55:09.340]  Oh wow, deliberate red.
[55:09.740 --> 55:09.920]  Weird.
[55:10.880 --> 55:11.440]  It's okay.
[55:13.320 --> 55:14.360]  He's got a plan.
[55:15.620 --> 55:15.900]  Hmm.
[55:17.640 --> 55:17.880]  Oops.
[55:22.270 --> 55:25.250]  Where is everybody versus...
[55:25.250 --> 55:26.530]  Everybody else?
[55:26.770 --> 55:29.390]  There's a bonus star for most emotes, right?
[55:29.790 --> 55:30.930]  Yeah, you better start hitting them.
[55:30.930 --> 55:31.650]  There you go.
[55:33.790 --> 55:35.670]  Jordude said, fuck, I'm late. What did I miss?
[55:35.770 --> 55:36.210]  Oh, nothing.
[55:36.470 --> 55:38.350]  How many pennants did we buy, do you know?
[55:38.510 --> 55:39.590]  I don't... It was a lot.
[55:39.870 --> 55:41.190]  It was a lot, a lot.
[55:41.950 --> 55:43.370]  Well, feel free to keep buying them.
[55:43.470 --> 55:44.990]  It sounds like we have a lot to sell still.
[55:45.090 --> 55:45.690]  Oh, nice.
[55:48.510 --> 55:48.790]  Oh.
[55:49.850 --> 55:51.410]  A great gift for someone else.
[55:51.610 --> 55:53.630]  Yeah, it really is.
[55:54.190 --> 55:54.830]  That's a great one.
[55:54.970 --> 55:56.150]  Hey, happy birthday.
[55:56.150 --> 55:59.570]  It's one of those things that can be a loving gift or a fuck you gift.
[56:02.530 --> 56:03.790]  It's a multi-dimensional gift.
[56:03.810 --> 56:06.330]  Really good. Hey, man, I was thinking of you.
[56:07.390 --> 56:08.330]  What the fuck?
[56:08.730 --> 56:12.170]  So to get Peach, all you have to do is not roll a three or a four.
[56:12.370 --> 56:12.710]  Okay.
[56:13.890 --> 56:14.750]  All right, that'll work.
[56:14.830 --> 56:16.450]  Pretty good. I'll take that.
[56:18.290 --> 56:20.050]  Let's go Peachwood.
[56:22.110 --> 56:23.110]  What does she give you?
[56:23.110 --> 56:24.970]  A half-off discount with the store.
[56:25.130 --> 56:26.850]  Also double items when you get stuff.
[56:26.950 --> 56:28.090]  So now we'll play for Peach.
[56:29.150 --> 56:30.170]  We'll peach off.
[56:31.310 --> 56:32.250]  We'll peach off.
[56:33.270 --> 56:34.150]  Get peached.
[56:35.050 --> 56:35.830]  Here we go.
[56:39.250 --> 56:40.810]  Damn, that's a great ability.
[56:40.830 --> 56:41.410]  Could've used you.
[56:43.870 --> 56:46.570]  Does that count for Boo as well? Probably not, right?
[56:46.750 --> 56:47.790]  I don't think so.
[56:50.070 --> 56:51.090]  Peach's day off.
[56:51.250 --> 56:51.970]  Oh, this one.
[56:51.970 --> 56:53.090]  Okay.
[56:55.010 --> 56:56.390]  What's the action button?
[56:57.670 --> 56:58.330]  Oh, that's for later.
[56:58.490 --> 56:59.310]  Ah, piss.
[57:00.830 --> 57:01.070]  All right.
[57:01.410 --> 57:01.930]  Get away!
[57:03.150 --> 57:04.990]  All you gotta do is walk down.
[57:06.530 --> 57:06.790]  Easy!
[57:08.070 --> 57:09.890]  This is actually a baby game.
[57:11.770 --> 57:12.150]  Oh.
[57:14.030 --> 57:15.150]  Drop it.
[57:16.230 --> 57:17.270]  Everybody fuck up Wario.
[57:18.730 --> 57:20.550]  You go left, I go right.
[57:20.550 --> 57:21.010]  Okay.
[57:21.490 --> 57:22.790]  That's ridiculous.
[57:23.670 --> 57:24.570]  It worked!
[57:26.790 --> 57:28.970]  I don't think anyone touched Mario.
[57:29.070 --> 57:29.850]  No, I was touched by Wario.
[57:29.850 --> 57:32.070]  You don't need to touch Wario to get me.
[57:32.250 --> 57:34.050]  Okay, that was Nick by himself again.
[57:35.350 --> 57:36.350]  Ah, piss!
[57:36.350 --> 57:36.810]  Fuck you!
[57:37.650 --> 57:39.850]  Nick is, like, against Nick.
[57:40.250 --> 57:41.390]  Damn you, Geoff!
[57:42.430 --> 57:43.530]  Dude, this is Dilkong.
[57:43.810 --> 57:46.310]  Look at Dilkong, he's just running away with the box.
[57:46.330 --> 57:46.850]  He is.
[57:46.850 --> 57:48.090]  This is Dilkong.
[57:48.090 --> 57:50.470]  No! No! Get riddled!
[57:50.670 --> 57:52.410]  Dil time. Dil time.
[57:52.650 --> 57:54.230]  No! Nick's out.
[57:54.790 --> 57:56.230]  Oh, the pole's out.
[57:56.610 --> 57:57.730]  That was me. I was trying to...
[57:57.730 --> 58:01.350]  I don't know if there's a prize for first, but...
[58:01.930 --> 58:03.110]  Is that enough to...
[58:03.110 --> 58:03.610]  Hey guys, wait up!
[58:03.930 --> 58:05.990]  I didn't bring you anything.
[58:07.570 --> 58:08.050]  Ooh!
[58:08.630 --> 58:09.890]  I think you got it, Andrew.
[58:10.150 --> 58:12.070]  Yeah! Good start for Dil!
[58:13.130 --> 58:14.770]  All right. Andrew with the head start.
[58:15.830 --> 58:16.310]  Oh.
[58:17.650 --> 58:18.770]  Here we go.
[58:18.870 --> 58:20.290]  Oh yeah, this one. I love this one.
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.070]  This is a great one.
[58:21.290 --> 58:23.030]  Oh, the tray one.
[58:23.510 --> 58:24.250]  Tray time.
[58:27.750 --> 58:29.290]  All right, I'm locked in.
[58:29.570 --> 58:30.970]  I'm so locked in.
[58:32.230 --> 58:32.650]  Nice.
[58:32.790 --> 58:33.810]  Thank you. I'll take that.
[58:35.110 --> 58:35.590]  Yes!
[58:35.970 --> 58:37.010]  Oh, great.
[58:37.830 --> 58:38.110]  Oh!
[58:38.110 --> 58:38.590]  Ow!
[58:42.110 --> 58:42.950]  Shit!
[58:49.900 --> 58:50.740]  Geoff!
[58:55.640 --> 58:57.020]  I like you.
[58:58.040 --> 58:59.420]  So nobody's just gonna...
[58:59.420 --> 59:00.340]  I like you.
[59:01.500 --> 59:03.860]  Nick! I want some donuts!
[59:04.820 --> 59:06.340]  Andrew, go to hell.
[59:07.040 --> 59:07.780]  Three.
[59:08.160 --> 59:09.520]  Four. Take them.
[59:09.520 --> 59:10.500]  There's yours.
[59:11.640 --> 59:12.460]  Thank you!
[59:13.320 --> 59:13.800]  Wow!
[59:17.780 --> 59:18.840]  Clever for two.
[59:19.060 --> 59:20.920]  Andrew, running away.
[59:28.480 --> 59:28.960]  Guys.
[59:30.080 --> 59:30.440]  Guys.
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.780]  Oh, what's this one?
[59:34.000 --> 59:34.960]  Oh, yeah.
[59:35.740 --> 59:38.040]  What's this shit? Oh, you just collect and throw it in.
[59:38.160 --> 59:39.000]  Give her what she wants.
[59:39.420 --> 59:40.700]  Get her what she wants.
[59:40.760 --> 59:41.460]  What does she want?
[59:46.600 --> 59:48.040]  How do you pick it up?
[59:49.460 --> 59:50.640]  Pick it up!
[59:51.320 --> 59:52.040]  God damn it.
[59:52.560 --> 59:53.620]  Damn you.
[59:54.700 --> 59:57.320]  Well, get the thing, you freaking idiot.
[59:57.620 --> 59:58.480]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[59:58.540 --> 59:59.640]  Come on, Mario, let's go!
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.620]  Mario, let's go!
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.500]  Pick it up!
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.360]  Mario, you fool!
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.580]  Not that!
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.340]  Mario, you fucking put it down!
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.520]  What are you guys doing?
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.060]  Andrew, you got this thing locked in.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.960]  They don't know how to pick shit up.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.880]  They're fucking morons.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.120]  Plumb up!
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.620]  Oh, it's locked in.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.580]  Give us another one!
[01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.980]  Thank you!
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.780]  You prick!
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.380]  Oh, give me that beat!
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.140]  Solace is right.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.800]  Gavin is jeffing this so hard.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.580]  I got second, Geoff got fourth.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.340]  Well, you haven't seen this yet.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.340]  Yeah, you don't know.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.320]  I think Nick got fourth.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:45.980]  No!
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.520]  Oh, wow!
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.860]  Alright, let's see how you did.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.240]  Plus 20.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.720]  And then how did Dilkong do?
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:03.880]  Dil! Dil! Dil!
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.180]  45!
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.820]  Give it to me, Peach!
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.780]  Give me the discount!
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.100]  Congratulations, Andrew bought a friend.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.080]  Idiot flags for all of you!
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.060]  I bought a friend!
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.440]  I said it couldn't be done.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.580]  Hey, how close to you?
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.240]  That's right, you're happy to be ally of Dilkong!
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.940]  Ally of Dilkong?
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:36.980]  Ally of Dil.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:39.680]  No way!
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.360]  Damn!
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.560]  Alright, let's see where he wound up.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.180]  Oh, this is a shot.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.900]  Oh, that would have come in handy for you.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:48.860]  Okay, same items.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.960]  What are these dog items?
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.420]  I'll take a glove.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.360]  Oh, wow!
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.800]  Power glove?
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.080]  Yeah, give me that.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.420]  Let me take every coin of someone.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:23.960]  No!
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:25.400]  No!
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:27.080]  Okay.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.180]  I'll take 15, hell yeah!
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.320]  It's like winning a minigame.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.500]  Something I haven't done.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:36.780]  Yeah!
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:40.520]  Punch it!
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:41.880]  Jesus!
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.520]  Oh, he's going to land on a Bowser spot.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.420]  Oh, please.
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:50.880]  I avoided it by one!
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.740]  Don't let him get that cheap star.
[01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:03.190]  Double coins again!
[01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.270]  Although if he gets it right now,
[01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:07.410]  the upside to it is he can't buy a second one.
[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.730]  Unless he wins this.
[01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:10.150]  Because he can't afford it?
[01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:11.570]  Right, he's 29.
[01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:13.350]  Well, it's only 10 though, isn't it?
[01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.230]  You don't stand a chance.
[01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:19.710]  Is this the arrow one?
[01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.290]  Oh, it's this, okay.
[01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:23.410]  Oh, it's Psych Out.
[01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:25.270]  Psych Out, the game!
[01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:32.230]  I'm not going to move.
[01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:34.510]  Oh, I should move.
[01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:35.510]  Yes!
[01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:40.150]  Separate!
[01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:41.350]  Separate!
[01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:43.350]  Wow!
[01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.430]  Straight as an arrow.
[01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.270]  Fly true, Geoff.
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.330]  Ah!
[01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:59.920]  He got plenty more room.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.880]  I believe in you two.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.840]  He can't get us both.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.260]  Oh!
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.500]  How did you dodge that?
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.600]  What a move!
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.440]  If you both go left and right, he can't win.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.080]  Here's what I'm thinking we do.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.500]  I'll be on the far left, you'll be on the far right.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:20.140]  He can't get us both.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.860]  What are you going to do, Geoff?
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.260]  I'm just going to kill you.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.500]  That'll work.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.820]  We did it!
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.200]  Nice fake out.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.440]  I wouldn't have taken the risk.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.340]  Jugs McTugs, 10 gifted.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.660]  That was Jugs McTugs.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.160]  Chugging them tugs.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:42.480]  What?
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.960]  God bless Jugs McTugs.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.480]  All right!
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.340]  Hey, we're in week two.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.960]  That was a nice little ritual to have for a while.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:08.020]  I was recording it at Blaine's almost every day.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.260]  What a misery.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.180]  No!
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.300]  You're going to go twice!
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.740]  Wait, you get the bomb?
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.140]  No, the bomb's going to Andrew.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.740]  Oh, he's getting the bomb!
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.180]  Not cool.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.460]  But I paid for that, friend!
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.640]  Oh, double Bowser?
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.080]  What?
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.220]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:36.160]  Oh my god.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.960]  That's rough.
[01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.270]  Don't you do it, Peach.
[01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.350]  Just the one.
[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.110]  Or maybe he'll realize here.
[01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.410]  You would be so mean.
[01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.910]  Yeah.
[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:55.230]  Oh, I just forgot about something.
[01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.110]  Great, I get another achievement.
[01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:03.410]  Oh, he's bankrupted.
[01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:08.270]  A 35 coin lost turn.
[01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.850]  On the same turn you took a bomb to the face.
[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:12.230]  Insane.
[01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:13.330]  You still have a star, though.
[01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.990]  Eh, not for long.
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:16.210]  Wow.
[01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:16.410]  Wow.
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:19.190]  Could've gone better.
[01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.850]  This has been a rough turn.
[01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:25.370]  Dude, I'm really sorry.
[01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.250]  But if we're going to make it rough for you,
[01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.190]  I think we should make it rough on Gavin, too.
[01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.330]  Oh, you're moving the star!
[01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:34.110]  Hey, let me reconsider.
[01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:35.310]  It's too late!
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:36.650]  I love it.
[01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:39.030]  Okay, reconsider now, though.
[01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:42.190]  Now that you've mentioned it, maybe I shouldn't have done it.
[01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:44.210]  Oh, it's back in the...
[01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.970]  Oh, it's right at the beginning.
[01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:50.410]  Well, that is a bunch of old tosses.
[01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.030]  Oh, where's five gonna get you?
[01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.090]  Let's see.
[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:02.370]  Oh, what's this?
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.250]  Oh, it's a shop.
[01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.790]  Oh, new item!
[01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.450]  Ooh, skeleton key.
[01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:11.550]  Ooh, gates. Ooh, pipe.
[01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:13.170]  Ooh, opponents.
[01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.990]  Custom blocks.
[01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:16.390]  We're going two for it.
[01:07:16.790 --> 01:07:18.770]  After all that, you bought a double die.
[01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:19.950]  I'm just looking at my options!
[01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.650]  You're hearing him.
[01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:24.330]  This is how he is at 100% eat.
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.010]  When we go to a restaurant, and he starts seeing stuff
[01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.430]  that he wants to order, also.
[01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:30.070]  Geoff, we need to do...
[01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.270]  Was it a stakeout?
[01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.330]  Yeah!
[01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.730]  We gotta do that soon, because I need to learn more about Nick at a restaurant.
[01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:38.690]  Dude, I'm gonna...
[01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:39.970]  I'm gonna get a...
[01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:42.210]  Yeah, I'm excited. I need to put some work into it.
[01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:42.790]  It's not for content.
[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.390]  I'm gonna buy some equipment for us.
[01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:46.290]  We're not recording.
[01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:50.050]  Please, just start pointing stuff out.
[01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:51.170]  Oh, no.
[01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:52.410]  Frickass.
[01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:55.450]  What the fuck is that?
[01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.050]  Dude, you get loads all over you.
[01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:00.450]  What?
[01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:02.970]  I blow my load stone.
[01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.070]  What the fuck was that?
[01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:07.110]  I want my friend back.
[01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:09.470]  I paid good money for that friend.
[01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:12.630]  But I bought it.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.590]  You paid for it, too.
[01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:16.610]  No!
[01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.710]  Oh, okay. That's great.
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:23.270]  Is that a thousand?
[01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:26.830]  Stop! Wario, shut up!
[01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.370]  That might be a bonus star for it.
[01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:30.150]  Go right.
[01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:31.010]  I hate him.
[01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:34.250]  Oh my god.
[01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.950]  Oh my god.
[01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.030]  It's so much worse than we can hear him.
[01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.470]  I hate him so much.
[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.190]  Nick.
[01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:51.390]  Hey, bud.
[01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:52.810]  I hope it doesn't involve rowing.
[01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:54.830]  Picking produce.
[01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:56.790]  We got this.
[01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.910]  Stewart the Bumbler, in effect.
[01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:02.370]  Oh, we did so good at this, Nick.
[01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.450]  We've done this before.
[01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.330]  We know what we're doing.
[01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:05.950]  Yeah.
[01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.370]  Oh, why'd you...
[01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:12.330]  There you go.
[01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:14.190]  Alright, Wario, hit it.
[01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:14.730]  Yeah, we got it.
[01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.530]  Yeah.
[01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:18.230]  Let's go, Nick.
[01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.910]  We got it.
[01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:24.130]  We know what's up with fruit.
[01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:25.710]  We're born to fruit.
[01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.990]  It's alright, I got it.
[01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.450]  There you go.
[01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.990]  Wow.
[01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:34.650]  Look at him go, look at him go, boys.
[01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:35.970]  Flying.
[01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:37.930]  Neck and neck here.
[01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.870]  What'd I do that for?
[01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:42.970]  Don't do stuff like that.
[01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.210]  Dilkong going bananas.
[01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.170]  No! It's all gone wrong.
[01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.870]  Dilkong is going ape right now.
[01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:50.550]  Geoff, get those.
[01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:51.650]  Bananas!
[01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.910]  Hey, perfect round, Andrew.
[01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.490]  Andrew crushed it.
[01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.390]  Flawless.
[01:09:59.130 --> 01:09:59.730]  Way to go, boys.
[01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.610]  We didn't say a word.
[01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.610]  I think about a third of the way into that, I forgot which fruit I was thinking of.
[01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:07.070]  Why, Geoff?
[01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.410]  I just got really... I got all spun around.
[01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:11.910]  Had my head up in the grapes.
[01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:14.590]  Idiot flags in the chat.
[01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:16.470]  New turn.
[01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:17.770]  Idiot flags on your wall.
[01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:20.090]  Uh-oh.
[01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:22.190]  Imposter?
[01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:24.070]  Oh, he's making more spaces.
[01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:26.350]  Yeah, that's where he does bad stuff.
[01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:27.990]  Oh, God!
[01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.510]  So why is he an imposter?
[01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:31.030]  Why not?
[01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.770]  I guess he's... yeah, I don't know.
[01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:36.730]  He's got that purple glow around him.
[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.750]  I think he's like a hologram.
[01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:39.810]  Fake it till you make it, right?
[01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:44.770]  Low roll.
[01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:46.370]  Low roll.
[01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:49.670]  Low roll.
[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:51.110]  Roll a ten and come to me.
[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:51.650]  Oh, no.
[01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:53.430]  I'll take that.
[01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:55.370]  My friend again.
[01:10:58.410 --> 01:10:59.070]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[01:10:59.250 --> 01:10:59.490]  Okay.
[01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:05.090]  Reverse the board.
[01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.370]  I think he's gonna get shot.
[01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:09.730]  I think he's about to pull
[01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:10.770]  the fucking trigger.
[01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:12.730]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:15.550]  That might have been good if it sent you back to the start.
[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:17.090]  Nope, that didn't.
[01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.050]  I think it just takes coins?
[01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.250]  Yeah, but I didn't have any.
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.150]  No, you...
[01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:27.550]  No.
[01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.090]  No!
[01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:36.390]  Awesome.
[01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.310]  Cool.
[01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.930]  Very unenthusiastic cool.
[01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.510]  How do I wanna...
[01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.710]  Yeah, get out of here.
[01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:45.130]  Yeah!
[01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:46.890]  There you go.
[01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:47.630]  Here we go.
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.130]  I'm feeling good.
[01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:51.410]  Nice.
[01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.710]  Six.
[01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:55.570]  Holy shit.
[01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:58.550]  You might just get the next star while you're at it.
[01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:00.250]  Hello! Goodbye.
[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:05.250]  I haven't even got to the pipe yet.
[01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.010]  Oh, I can stop at the store on the way.
[01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:07.910]  Oh, and get coins?
[01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.110]  Oh, so the coins you just got shot off.
[01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.530]  Yeah!
[01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.910]  You know what?
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:13.410]  Oh, it's forgiven.
[01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.810]  Oh, man.
[01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:19.270]  This is feeling great!
[01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:20.830]  You know what? This really came in handy.
[01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:23.170]  Yeah! Blow the whistle.
[01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.250]  Call me the whistle blower.
[01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.990]  Actually, don't do that.
[01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.310]  I don't know anything about planes.
[01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:35.210]  Right.
[01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:38.370]  Thank you.
[01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.510]  Yeah!
[01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:43.410]  Wow.
[01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:44.630]  Consecutive stars.
[01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:47.990]  We're in turn nine.
[01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:49.570]  We're getting close to a third of the way through.
[01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:51.470]  Oh, a third?
[01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.370]  I think it's all over the board.
[01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.690]  Yep.
[01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:56.990]  Where's the next one? Right in front of me.
[01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:59.730]  Right behind Gavin.
[01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:01.450]  All the way over there.
[01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:03.910]  How do you get over there?
[01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.830]  Bowser Square.
[01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:07.430]  Damn.
[01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.710]  Oh, God.
[01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:10.970]  Are you going to get more coins?
[01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:13.810]  Oh, my God. So many more coins.
[01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.750]  Ooh!
[01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:17.450]  It's fucking warm.
[01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:18.030]  Oh, I'm ready.
[01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.990]  Go right.
[01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:23.130]  I think, uh...
[01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:23.930]  Take a little detour.
[01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:26.310]  Wow!
[01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:33.870]  He's taking care of this fucking guy.
[01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.010]  I guess I could burn that thing, man.
[01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.470]  So what is that thing?
[01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:38.390]  It just takes up a spot.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:41.690]  Rumored to be valuable, but...
[01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:44.970]  What does it do?
[01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:46.070]  Is there a coin in it?
[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:47.630]  Oh!
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:48.650]  Sick.
[01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:52.010]  Thanks, Lodestone.
[01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:55.410]  Is the office store portion going to be a separate video?
[01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:56.950]  Yeah, probably. We'll upload that separately.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.660]  Oh, this is a big one.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:03.860]  It's a giant one.
[01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:04.300]  Boss fight.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.040]  It takes five coins.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:08.940]  That's rough.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:10.940]  Oh, no.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.520]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.040]  Not enough, dude.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.560]  It burned off my Tash.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.460]  You just lost your load.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:22.500]  What's this?
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.160]  Is this good?
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.620]  Bye-bye.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.680]  A red pipe.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.740]  Yeah, those are always good.
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.260]  Oh!
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:32.920]  Oh, cool!
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:34.480]  Great!
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.100]  You're back in the square.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:42.680]  You're back in the square.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.120]  Punch it.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.780]  Fuck!
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:49.460]  Ow!
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.160]  You ran me over, you son of a bitch.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.180]  Why would you do that?
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.940]  Oh, you took a...
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.080]  Oh, my friend back.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.340]  I think you have to toss them, though.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:00.420]  Ridiculous.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.760]  You didn't get her.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.220]  Nope.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.820]  But I wanted it.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.400]  Geoff just has to run like the wind.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:13.860]  Oh!
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.420]  Alright, we got this.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:18.200]  The red team up.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.280]  Oh, fuck.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.200]  This is a masher.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.820]  Oh, I'm...
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.440]  Oh.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:25.880]  Lock in.
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.040]  Yeah, you wish it was that way.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:30.760]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.420]  Alright, boys.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:37.860]  This is gonna get my bingo.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:38.480]  Is that doing anything?
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.320]  Hold them both in shape.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.820]  I think you have to hold one.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.200]  Why are you not doing anything?
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:50.520]  Are you holding the right button?
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.640]  Yeah, just press start, though, so it's...
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.600]  But it's not doing it.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.080]  There it is.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.660]  I just want to make sure I have the right button.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.200]  Yeah, just make sure my teammate has the right button.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:03.840]  No, they got it.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.900]  Alright, go off.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:07.680]  Oh!
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:08.340]  Geoff!
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.280]  What are you doing?
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:12.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.160]  How do we get back into the game?
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:15.900]  Go up.
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:17.740]  Up.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:18.380]  There you go.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.080]  No!
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.780]  What are you doing?
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.140]  We won!
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:26.600]  We won!
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:27.700]  What?
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:32.820]  Andrew, is this playing in the background?
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.060]  What?
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.100]  I think it's just gonna play the whole time.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:36.580]  Yeah!
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.320]  Clip that.
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:40.060]  Clip it.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.580]  He fucking Geoffed it.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.460]  He fucking Geoffed it.
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.880]  Geoff went to the dashboard for the entire round.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.120]  Andrew, we only saw the dashboard,
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.860]  and then he almost closed the game.
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.880]  Idiot flags like crazy in the chat.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.700]  I'm freaked out.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.020]  I'm freaked out.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.180]  I like how the game keeps going.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.040]  What the fuck is that?
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:10.860]  It's my turn now.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.080]  Oh my god, I'm gonna puke.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.040]  That was Geoff. That was insane.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:17.600]  Thank you.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.540]  So were you just mashing completely alone, Andrew?
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:26.640]  No, I was also stuck in a screen.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.460]  I hit the wrong button.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.780]  How did you win?
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.720]  I think we got like four in.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.780]  Yeah, I think we got like a few more in before they did.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:35.900]  And then timed out.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.580]  Oh my god.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.320]  Yeah, from what I saw, Andrew, only I was hitting it.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:41.920]  Yeah.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:44.220]  Oh, it got everybody.
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:45.660]  Whoops.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:46.860]  I don't want that.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.160]  Nice.
[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:52.800]  Thank you.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.240]  I can't believe you.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.820]  When the thing went over to close and then started bumping around.
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.240]  Did you press it?
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.780]  Oh my god.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.620]  I thought it was over.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.200]  I watched it very carefully look at A...
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.140]  B...
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.340]  Is it this way now or is it this way?
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.440]  Oh my god.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.800]  I love that we went to that screen and Andrew went,
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.480]  Oh, I went to that screen too.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.560]  I was in the exact same place trying to not close the game.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.880]  One. One. One. One. One.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.720]  One. One. One. One.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.820]  Come on, man.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.960]  One. One. One. One.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.480]  One. One. One. One.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.780]  One. One. One. One.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.440]  Boo!
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.280]  Yes!
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.760]  Well, I don't...
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.300]  I don't want Nick to feel left out.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.540]  I mean, we all got one.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.980]  You know what? Fair is fair.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.780]  Fair is fair, Andrew.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.760]  I came so fast.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:58.880]  I came so fast.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.400]  Nick is trying to show him what buttons to press
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:04.520]  that are on the screen.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.120]  Well, it's because when the controller's sideways
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.020]  the buttons are placed far enough
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.800]  and it gets scary all of a sudden.
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:11.480]  Yeah, it did.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.100]  Oh my god.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.240]  When you were on close, it was just hopping around.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.000]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.220]  Incredible. Incredible.
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.580]  And egg for breakfast. Gifting subs.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.000]  Thank you so much.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:24.200]  Thank you.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200]  Appreciate everyone coming through and watching here today.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.560]  This has been a great anniversary.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.180]  Really fun celebration.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.000]  And we're one third of the way through this.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:32.920]  I love this one.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.100]  And I guess we'll be out here
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.380]  trying to over-deliver again
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.880]  by accident for this whole year.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.120]  We're gonna try.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.840]  We were just kind of excited to make stuff.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.440]  It wasn't even that intentional.
[01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:55.210]  Too late.
[01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.830]  What'd I say?
[01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:01.270]  What'd I say?
[01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:02.610]  I told the yellow one.
[01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:04.770]  He can't hear you.
[01:20:04.890 --> 01:20:05.210]  He's drowning.
[01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.950]  Oh shit.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.200]  Alright boys, how you feeling?
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.440]  Feeling great.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:13.120]  And cut it!
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:17.980]  Oh shit!
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.180]  Oh wait, I did the wrong one.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:22.740]  Was that the wrong one?
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.420]  What's the button to drop it?
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.680]  Oh fuck! I missed it!
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:26.840]  Yes!
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:32.920]  Okay.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.720]  I feel like I've only ever seen that game
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.280]  where everyone's kind of like...
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.380]  That was so immensely different.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.620]  I've never seen the camera
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:45.460]  go that far back.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.580]  I thought it was the first one, Penguin.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.380]  Oh god.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:55.760]  No change!
[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.440]  My face hurts from laughing.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.720]  This is crazy.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.660]  I only turned 11!
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.460]  That should be our tagline.
[01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.060]  Schindler's Fist has gifted Nick a sub.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.100]  That's pretty cool.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.060]  Nick, you have a sub.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.240]  Thanks, Schindler's Fist.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:12.260]  He could have done more.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.220]  It's a movie reference.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.140]  Remember? I could have done more.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:17.820]  I could have done so much more.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.220]  Good movie.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.600]  It's a heavy movie.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.900]  Schindler's List or Schindler's Fist?
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:25.200]  Both. Well, he could have done more.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.220]  Thanks.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.660]  Take my comeuppance.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:42.360]  Hey, what's up?
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:42.980]  Hi, man.
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:43.980]  Good to see you again.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:45.900]  Anything that helped you?
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:47.900]  Yeah.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:48.720]  Thank you.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.860]  It's the two star boys.
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.940]  Oh, I'm in heck.
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.260]  Spin it the other way if you want.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.520]  What would that do for me?
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:00.860]  Spin it the other way.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:03.860]  It would reverse the direction.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:04.920]  Oh, do it then.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.040]  That's why he recommended it.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.280]  Let me think about it.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.240]  Do you need to whiteboard it out?
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.360]  Do it.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.820]  Do it.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:15.740]  Fly away.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.660]  That's right.
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.660]  Giant imposter bastard.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.220]  Suck it.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:27.280]  Suck it, Bowser.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.040]  One.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:29.820]  One.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.400]  It's the funniest.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.580]  Let me just quickly kill this.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.180]  Yeah, you got him.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.360]  I think we always roll high on this guy.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.080]  But never the other one.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.140]  Here we go.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.260]  Damn, you're loaded, dude.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.380]  Go!
[01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:55.160]  Am I supposed to be doing something?
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.200]  That was weird.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.640]  Just having a stare off.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.760]  He went back to the main menu.
[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:02.220]  Sweet.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.860]  Now I can steal two stars.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.420]  I'm not going to allow that.
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.380]  Are we going to get a drink?
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.300]  Anyone want anything?
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.280]  Can I have one of these?
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.540]  I'm going to take a piss later.
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.480]  You can't do that for me.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.100]  Do you want me to mute you?
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:18.540]  I don't give a shit.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.080]  You can go nuts.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.260]  He's going to have his Robert Durst moment.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:34.660]  Twisting sword.
[01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:36.600]  I don't know, I've played this game.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.720]  You killed her.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.680]  You fucking killed her.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.240]  You fucking killed her.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.420]  Shut up.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.680]  You fucking killed her.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:47.580]  You have to shut up.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.880]  Eric, you got Burtmore.
[01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:55.210]  Alright, I'm feeling good.
[01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:56.870]  Okie dokie.
[01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:00.330]  That guy's dead.
[01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.790]  Oh, that guy?
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.400]  Oops.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.020]  Hey, Eric's back.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.560]  What's everybody talking about?
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.980]  Oh, fuck.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.340]  Thanks, Eric-san.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.260]  No problem.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:18.080]  Just moving to Andrew.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.660]  Oh shit, it made me do stupid.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.160]  Oh no.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:25.460]  Fuck.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:26.660]  Fuck.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.280]  I dropped my controller.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.500]  Ah, balls.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:34.880]  Yeah, get in there.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:35.560]  Fuck.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:37.600]  No.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.860]  Damn you fish.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.760]  What a divide.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.400]  Holy shit.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.320]  Roll in.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:49.960]  No.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.340]  We tried.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:52.820]  No.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.460]  I thought it was over and I stopped playing.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:24:59.040]  Yeah, you did.
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:00.760]  We never gave up.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.520]  Never gave up.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:02.440]  No retreat, no surrender.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.020]  Thank you.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.280]  Andrew, can you open my water for me?
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:09.300]  Oh god, no.
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.600]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:11.640]  No problem, here.
[01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:17.780]  Did that open it?
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.660]  A little bit harder.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:21.780]  I'm trying.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:23.100]  Didn't work.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.080]  What about this?
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:25.860]  No.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:26.280]  Didn't work.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.320]  What about this?
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:30.820]  No.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.780]  Thank you.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.180]  We get it?
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:35.780]  Yeah.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.560]  Yoshi.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.080]  Way more than I thought it would.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.440]  Thanks, Geoff.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.420]  That was money well spent.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.040]  Already using the towels?
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:58.600]  Yeah.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.340]  We bought beach towels for some reason.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:06.040]  Oh, there's a video that will come out at some point of our unboxing our first trip to the store.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:06.520]  That was fun.
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:09.460]  Andrew, you've dented it. It's really sharp with the lip bit.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.120]  I dented it?
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:12.060]  Yeah.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.140]  Was it already open?
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:14.540]  No.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.160]  It got dinged.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.860]  Oh, there's a star steal right here.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.320]  Shit!
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.880]  Yeah, don't land on that.
[01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:27.850]  Hello.
[01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:30.130]  I guess I'll just take some for you.
[01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.010]  Well, we'll just let chance decide.
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.950]  Don't look at me.
[01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:39.050]  What was he to do?
[01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.090]  You get $111.
[01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.610]  Yeah.
[01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:43.910]  You have two stars for $75.
[01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:46.110]  I have one star, asshole.
[01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.230]  Yeah, he couldn't get a star from me on that.
[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:48.990]  No, no, I was saying to Nick.
[01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.510]  I just distracted him, that's all.
[01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:53.570]  Nick was like...
[01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:55.450]  Blame fucking fate.
[01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:56.310]  Yeah, dude, fate.
[01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:58.450]  Yeah, blame Lynch.
[01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.330]  Lynch fate, dude.
[01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:04.110]  Fate is fickle, Gavin.
[01:27:04.530 --> 01:27:04.930]  Fickle fate.
[01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:07.530]  Fate is fickle.
[01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.130]  Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
[01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:13.190]  Are you opening that soda as fucking insane?
[01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:14.110]  That was crazy.
[01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:16.270]  That was so much more violent than it should have been.
[01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:16.730]  That was huge.
[01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.430]  Wild.
[01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:19.070]  Yeah!
[01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:23.070]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:24.970]  I'm just raking it in.
[01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:28.530]  For not having anything in this,
[01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.590]  this 7-Up Tropical whatever.
[01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:31.190]  Oh, how is it?
[01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.870]  Really good.
[01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:35.510]  I'd never heard of it before.
[01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:37.590]  I mean, it's like zero sugar, zero anything.
[01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:38.130]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:39.130]  Caffeine free.
[01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:40.990]  Oh, thank God.
[01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:42.430]  Holy shit.
[01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.850]  Pretty good.
[01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:45.630]  Pretty fucking lucky, buddy.
[01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:49.470]  Geoff, I'm really sorry.
[01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.170]  No, I understand.
[01:27:50.730 --> 01:27:51.590]  There's no random.
[01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:54.330]  No, it's...
[01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:57.330]  Alright, Nick has painted quite a large target on himself.
[01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:58.130]  For what?
[01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:02.090]  This fucking guy.
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:03.590]  For what?
[01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:05.630]  That's a great question.
[01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:06.110]  Happy birthday.
[01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:07.870]  Wait, what is that?
[01:28:08.010 --> 01:28:08.810]  Oh, no.
[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:12.150]  You didn't land on Sean this time.
[01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:12.690]  Oh, no!
[01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.950]  Gavin,
[01:28:16.110 --> 01:28:18.170]  our wives got a hot tip
[01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:19.930]  on some labooboos this morning.
[01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:21.990]  And they went hog wild.
[01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.430]  I just got a bunch of labooboo pics.
[01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:28.330]  We gotta figure out what our labooboo is.
[01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:30.050]  Oh, it's Ratty Boy, obviously.
[01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:31.810]  No, it's not.
[01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:32.850]  I hate him so much.
[01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:33.990]  It's been...
[01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:37.290]  This labooboo thing started about a week ago,
[01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:38.970]  but it is intense.
[01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:39.850]  I've seen labooboos.
[01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:40.930]  No!
[01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:44.430]  Fuck this!
[01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:45.810]  I'm outta here. Bye!
[01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.370]  That's some bullshit.
[01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:50.550]  I'm done. I don't even know where I am.
[01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:51.990]  Fuck this.
[01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:54.770]  Insane.
[01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:57.190]  Oh, that was horrific.
[01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:58.050]  Game is done.
[01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:59.210]  Andrew's on the run.
[01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:01.510]  He was coming for me.
[01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:03.330]  He was coming for me with everything he had.
[01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:04.410]  I want my coins back!
[01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:07.390]  That couldn't have gone better for you, Nick.
[01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:09.070]  No, that worked out really well.
[01:29:09.190 --> 01:29:10.370]  I can't believe it.
[01:29:10.670 --> 01:29:12.230]  Definitely look at the board again.
[01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:13.790]  Oh, Yoshi.
[01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:21.110]  Wow.
[01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:24.470]  Oh, you might be able to do it, Gavin.
[01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:26.310]  Go the other way.
[01:29:27.170 --> 01:29:27.970]  Yeah, listen to Nick.
[01:29:28.810 --> 01:29:30.590]  Yeah, get the Bowser square.
[01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:32.030]  Go the other way.
[01:29:32.210 --> 01:29:32.610]  This way?
[01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:32.970]  Go left.
[01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:36.030]  Can I control it?
[01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:36.330]  Damn.
[01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:41.270]  Alright, nobody take this one, alright?
[01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:44.450]  No one take that one?
[01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:44.890]  Is that what you said?
[01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:46.650]  It's gonna be Nick Star in two turns.
[01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:53.010]  It's gonna be like eight stars to zero.
[01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.890]  I like that Andrew controlling his robot
[01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:00.970]  made him lose that sledding minigame.
[01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.810]  Crazy.
[01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:13.390]  Look at that moron bot.
[01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:19.410]  You think you know it?
[01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:24.630]  So is it just like a guess thing?
[01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:26.750]  Am I not just gonna help people know it?
[01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:28.590]  I think you are.
[01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:32.270]  Dude, hell yeah. Oh, it wasn't that.
[01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:34.990]  It wasn't either? Bullshit.
[01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:43.870]  Dude, I wanna just keep eating those kolaches.
[01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:46.370]  Do it, dude. There's plenty. And there's donuts, too.
[01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.170]  I could get up on the donut, actually.
[01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:50.290]  I had one of them. They were very good.
[01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:53.110]  How many donuts is too many for one day?
[01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:54.090]  One?
[01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:54.350]  No.
[01:30:56.650 --> 01:30:57.770]  Honestly? Yeah.
[01:30:58.970 --> 01:31:00.410]  How many donuts is too many?
[01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.850]  Three.
[01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:02.150]  Wow!
[01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.530]  I accept my fate.
[01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:06.130]  You just have so many.
[01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.810]  You know what?
[01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:11.410]  Last time I took one from Gavin, it lasted a turn.
[01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:13.090]  So I just don't trust it at the moment.
[01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.090]  Flaming Ginger just ordered their shirt.
[01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.770]  Thank you.
[01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:18.470]  Thank you so much.
[01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.910]  Regulationstore.com.
[01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:22.650]  Hopefully it's a regulation shirt or a patch shirt.
[01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.710]  And not one of these two ratty boy shirts.
[01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:27.570]  That's up to you, I suppose.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.840]  Thank you.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.060]  Back in the shop.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.580]  Give me one of these.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.080]  Creepy little wizard man.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.020]  What?
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:00.460]  Bullshit.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.220]  Some coins!
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:05.100]  I hope there's dog shit in it.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.380]  It's a bag of dog shit.
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.720]  It's like a flaming bag of dog shit.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.820]  Lumber Tumble.
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:22.900]  I don't remember this one.
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.040]  I don't either.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.600]  Did we do this before?
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:28.740]  Oh yeah.
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.720]  You can do that right away.
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:36.920]  Right away?
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.920]  Yeah, hold down for a boost.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.940]  Oh shit.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:48.480]  Wait.
[01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:50.120]  Wait.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:50.740]  Wait.
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:52.760]  Wait.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.500]  No, you Wario, you dick!
[01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:57.720]  You pushed me off!
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.220]  Then you pricks!
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:02.760]  No!
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:06.160]  Kill that yellow bastard.
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.720]  No, I'm not winning.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.160]  Monkey, get him.
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:11.500]  I'm trying, I'm trying!
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.000]  Come on, Grape Ape, what are you doing?
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.360]  Stop him.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.060]  Win by killing him.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:18.760]  Oh no!
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.300]  Oh shit.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.100]  Oh piss and shit.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:24.740]  Stop him, stop him.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:25.580]  Kill him, kill him!
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.700]  Take that!
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:30.960]  Wait, it doesn't just end?
[01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:32.780]  No, you gotta beat it!
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.580]  Get to the ground!
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.500]  Why would you listen to Geoff?
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.640]  He's the one that's going out.
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.780]  Come on, come on, come on!
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.060]  Come on!
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.900]  Oh shit.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.120]  The dill waited!
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:51.160]  The dill survived.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.140]  Wow.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:54.680]  Wow.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.460]  Dill lives.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.000]  Dill lives again to give somebody else a star.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.320]  He's just a star holder.
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:03.980]  It's me.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.500]  Oh, Yoshi's still on the board.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.280]  I forgot about that.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:13.820]  You can buy a friend.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:16.400]  He's like, guys, I've been hanging next to Bowser a lot lately.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.500]  Oh, look at the board.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.820]  What are you going to the board for?
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.220]  There's a lot of danger on the main circuit.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.540]  With that knowledge, I'm going to do nothing different.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:34.920]  Just like Gavin.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.340]  I don't know whether I'm going to do nothing different.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:46.640]  Okay.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:48.960]  Blink.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.480]  The patch shirt.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.460]  We are sold out of 3 and 4 XL.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:54.440]  Oh shit.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:00.620]  So we still have 2X XL, large, small, and extra medium.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.920]  Extra medium, hell yeah.
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:02.700]  Did you hear that?
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.220]  Yeah.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.160]  It hurt the back of my brain.
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:07.660]  Yeah, mine too.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:09.580]  Yes, we do have it.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.820]  I think we bought thousands of them.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:13.600]  I think there's a lot.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:18.560]  I think we wanted to try to see if we could do something to keep something in the store.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.020]  Yeah.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.700]  Instead of having it sell out immediately.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.220]  The easiest way to do it is to buy more than people want.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:23.720]  Yeah.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.360]  Well, then it's welcome in the Flop Zone, if that's the case.
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:26.760]  It's true.
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:28.500]  Welcome to the Flop Zone, guys.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.340]  But we'll have news on our next merch drop soon, so stay tuned.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:39.800]  We'll talk about probably our Gerpler that's going to be coming soon and some other stuff.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.580]  Dude, I can't wait to show you guys this new Gerpler.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:43.580]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.860]  It has already been ordered, it's already been designed.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.200]  But we have to wait. Patience.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.440]  It's a fucking Gerpler and a half, though.
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.500]  This is a money map.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.160]  Look at the money moves.
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.600]  We've also started conversations about a bit of a DIY.
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.900]  Listen to two podcasts from now.
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.540]  You're going to offer another two weeks?
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:05.360]  Two weeks, yeah.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.880]  I think it's episode 54.
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:08.660]  Sorry.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.820]  Give me 10 coins.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.040]  The Minecraft video seems to be doing really well.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.860]  Everyone really likes it.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:24.720]  Hell yeah.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.380]  It was just so crazy to be back.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:28.020]  It was so familiar, it felt like home.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:29.500]  And then I put the name burns on it.
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.980]  Yeah, pretty cool.
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.280]  Did you cry?
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.380]  Press the wrong button.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.100]  Yeah, it was pretty great.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.160]  No, you're alright.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.480]  It has a lot of people coming through.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.460]  They were really excited.
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.420]  I left a comment that said,
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.840]  we're live today at 11am central on our Twitch channel.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.400]  And a guy named Mr. Awesome said,
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.160]  nobody cares.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.720]  I let him know that maybe he was a little confused about what was happening here.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.500]  You're an idiot.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.120]  You did it from your personal account.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.880]  I'm not going to log into the other account.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.940]  I'm one of five people on this show,
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.900]  and my name is my name.
[01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:12.640]  He doesn't know that.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.040]  He just thinks some guy is promoting his livestream.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.500]  That's insane.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:18.180]  That's crazy.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.920]  He just saw Minecraft, showed up, and then read your comment.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:21.280]  He did.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.660]  He saw Minecraft.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.840]  Without Eric, it's just Ang.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:26.800]  Yeah.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.500]  Ang.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:33.200]  I think it's gang.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:34.140]  We're Ang Lee.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.240]  It's gang.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.900]  This is an interesting move by Andrew.
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.900]  Oh, he's gone to buy a friend.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.120]  He wants to buy a friend.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.520]  Oh no, is this the puzzle one?
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:51.000]  Is this the one with all the doors?
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:52.340]  Yes!
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.400]  No, the doors is Luigi, isn't it?
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:55.220]  Is it? Okay.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.280]  I don't remember.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.480]  It was me again.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.340]  Why was it you?
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:02.420]  Good question.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.940]  Yoshi's Mountain Race.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.240]  Oh!
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.960]  I don't know if I've...
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.100]  Oh, dicks, dude. Look at this.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.160]  Oh wow, this is cool.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.840]  What color Yoshi is everyone?
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.020]  I'm pink.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.180]  I'm red.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:19.700]  That's cool. That's neat.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.960]  I think green is
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.100]  probably the best Yoshi color.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.120]  A purist.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.200]  Definitely.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.880]  That's my advantage.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.840]  Can you do...
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.400]  Fruit makes you run faster.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.040]  Does...
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.700]  Does the jump... Do you get like extra
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:39.420]  Yoshi jump?
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:40.860]  You can flutter.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.400]  Oh my god, wow.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.420]  Taking the lead.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.700]  Oh, you missed, Nick.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.400]  Oh wow!
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.460]  That's a Wario right there.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:54.760]  Nice flutter.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:56.900]  Oh!
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.300]  Oh, Mario!
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:38:59.400]  Mario!
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.260]  What's the camera doing?
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.320]  I don't know, that looked terrible.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:08.600]  Flutter.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:09.820]  Come on, Yoshi.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.160]  Oh! Oh, but that's okay.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.520]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:16.340]  Mario sucks, he's falling apart.
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:17.660]  Go, go!
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.280]  Dilkong, a sizable lead.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:22.780]  Can he do it?
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:25.120]  Get Dil!
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:27.940]  Kill Dil!
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.580]  Kill Dil!
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  No, what the hell is that rock?
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:33.140]  It's made of rubber, you idiot.
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:34.040]  Don't hit the rock!
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.060]  Oh, you avoided it, Nick.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:37.700]  Don't kill Dil.
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:38.920]  I didn't think he'd respawn that quickly.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:41.720]  There you go.
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.580]  There you go.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.900]  Give, give me that.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:47.860]  Oh no!
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.800]  A sizable lead.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.900]  He's up there. Wario's on his tail.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:56.420]  Slow down, Dil, you wanker.
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.900]  Oh my god!
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.440]  Neck and neck!
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.340]  Kill Dil.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.060]  No!
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.440]  You fucked!
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:08.280]  You boxed me out!
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:13.260]  Get boxed, get a box, you giant Boston Bunker shit!
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:13.500]  You missed!
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:14.560]  Take that, you fool!
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.760]  You fucking idiot!
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.800]  You Wario-ass bitch!
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.340]  Oh no!
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.420]  Go back!
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.200]  That's what you get!
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.400]  You're fucking up, Gavin, you're fucking up!
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.100]  You don't box out of Dil!
[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:30.740]  Go back!
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.200]  Victor, no!
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.720]  Gavin!
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.740]  What happened?
[01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:39.740]  Gavin, idiot flex, dude.
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:43.560]  Have a look, bud.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:45.600]  Waving it high.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.180]  Gavin, no.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:48.960]  Wave those idiot flex!
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.080]  Oh, please land on me.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.680]  I got real caught up in trying to call you something mean.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.200]  Oh, shit.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.860]  Oh, yes!
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:00.440]  Wow!
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.220]  He's gonna land on it twice!
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:05.680]  He's getting double-bowsed again.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.420]  And he's gonna get double-teamed like this.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.580]  And he's gonna get double-teamed like this.
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:10.240]  That's not my coins, anyway.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:12.340]  Oh!
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.820]  Oh, you get to tag-team me.
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:15.020]  Oh!
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:20.820]  Yeah!
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:25.440]  Okay, let's get a Bowser revolution going.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:26.520]  No.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.640]  Idiot flex, don't come back.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:31.940]  Just going, yeah, they are being mean to you.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.380]  Deserved.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.400]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:36.920]  Keep it coming.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.780]  All players lose!
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.020]  You piece of shit, DK!
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.320]  Why did you fuck us?
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.740]  Wow.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.220]  Oh, cool.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.080]  We're all ready to be here for it.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.100]  Real prick move.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.960]  Yoshi's just like, what the fuck?
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.580]  I just got here.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.640]  Oh, did you, like, lose it twice?
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.380]  No, no, I get to go again.
[01:42:02.220 --> 01:42:02.520]  Oh.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:04.700]  Oh, my God.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.760]  At least you can't lose a star in this.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:09.620]  No!
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.440]  Okay.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.320]  30 coins.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:19.020]  Not great for the economy.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:22.960]  Oh!
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:28.740]  Now you guys are all going to come around and steal Yoshi's.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:29.300]  That was pointless.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:32.560]  Oh!
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.980]  Deal against the world, as it should be.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:36.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.740]  Lost in pound.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.020]  Which one's this one?
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.840]  It's where you get lost or you get pounded.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:43.860]  Oh, thanks.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.280]  I think that's a movie.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.160]  Oh, this one.
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:47.800]  Oh, we just have to coordinate.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.100]  I gotta get in the brains.
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.100]  You guys let me.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.260]  Let's let him pick first.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.120]  He's not going to do that, though.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.040]  Okay.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:02.520]  Okay.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:04.100]  Locked in.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.760]  I'll go yellow.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.080]  I think I want to go pink.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:09.080]  I'll go green.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:09.440]  Okay.
[01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:13.900]  Yes!
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:15.940]  That ain't good for me.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.040]  He's praying.
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:19.220]  Oh, man.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.880]  Right on the edge.
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:25.700]  All right.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.920]  I'll go blue.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.140]  I'll go pink.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:30.940]  I'll go green.
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.060]  This ain't good for me!
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:35.780]  Nice.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:37.780]  Fuck it.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:41.180]  Last time we did this, Gavin's just mashing buttons.
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.340]  He doesn't want to say anything.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:44.140]  I got slow as shit.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.840]  All right, I'm going to let him go.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.240]  What am I going to do?
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:50.600]  What am I going to do?
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.680]  What am I going to do?
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:55.960]  All right, I'm going to go yellow.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.700]  I'm going to go blue.
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:58.900]  I'm going to go green.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:00.960]  No!
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.380]  No!
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.160]  Yes!
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:06.560]  One for each of us.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:10.280]  Get...
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.060]  That was efficient.
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.020]  That was a real dill hammer.
[01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.870]  It looks like he's just watching.
[01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:25.690]  He's a little guy watching TV.
[01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:28.170]  It's like when my dog sees colors change.
[01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:28.930]  What's that?
[01:44:28.930 --> 01:44:29.890]  The colors, Duke.
[01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:34.870]  We need more guesses on this vault.
[01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:38.390]  Trying to get around to it is not easy.
[01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.870]  Yeah, you have to not hit blue, I think.
[01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:44.910]  Are you fucking kidding?
[01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:47.870]  Oh, this is going to be bad, Geoff.
[01:44:48.170 --> 01:44:49.030]  Oh, no, it's not. Never mind.
[01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:50.730]  No, it is! I'm fucking...
[01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:51.650]  No, it's bad.
[01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:52.790]  No.
[01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.810]  It's bad.
[01:44:58.550 --> 01:45:00.050]  How close is...
[01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:01.350]  I'm going to look at the board for just a second.
[01:45:02.370 --> 01:45:02.930]  It's seven.
[01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:04.950]  What?
[01:45:05.890 --> 01:45:09.010]  Hey, I want to give a shout out to Sensible B in the subreddit.
[01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:10.010]  Oh, look at that.
[01:45:10.610 --> 01:45:12.850]  We've got to print that and stick it on like that.
[01:45:13.290 --> 01:45:14.630]  Would that cover his camera up?
[01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:15.450]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:18.510]  We've just at least got to put a mustache on him.
[01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:21.310]  Do you have a mustache right now, Andrew?
[01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:22.990]  You know what? I'm just going to take a chance.
[01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:24.550]  Wait, why wouldn't you...
[01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.770]  What?
[01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:26.910]  What do you want?
[01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:27.210]  Nothing.
[01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:29.430]  Okay.
[01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:35.290]  I was going to take a chance.
[01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.810]  Why?
[01:45:36.850 --> 01:45:37.290]  Why?
[01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.430]  God damn it.
[01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:45.170]  He's going to be able to buy two stars.
[01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.690]  Wow.
[01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:48.750]  Double stars.
[01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:50.750]  Oh, that's just...
[01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:52.710]  Nice!
[01:45:54.670 --> 01:45:57.130]  Oh my god. Hold the fast forward. Hold the button.
[01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.710]  Oh yeah, sorry.
[01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:05.330]  No, my friend!
[01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:08.690]  Shut up, Wario. Shut up!
[01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:10.830]  It's just excited to be here.
[01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:11.550]  Yeah!
[01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:13.030]  Guys, I'm just excited to be here.
[01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:14.230]  I'm excited.
[01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:19.110]  Andrew, you said you have a mustache, but do you have a full beard?
[01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:19.470]  Yeah.
[01:46:19.530 --> 01:46:21.790]  You've got stars.
[01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:24.430]  Hey Gavin, do you have a mustache?
[01:46:25.730 --> 01:46:26.310]  Yeah, it's on there.
[01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:28.250]  Part of it.
[01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:33.930]  Is that right in front of Gavin?
[01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:35.650]  Check it out!
[01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:36.990]  Gavin, it's right in front of you!
[01:46:37.450 --> 01:46:41.390]  The four of us on the couch, all of us right here, we all have mustaches.
[01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:41.890]  Wow!
[01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:44.350]  That's how I would describe us.
[01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.990]  Mustache boys.
[01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:46.730]  So what, Andrew said no?
[01:46:47.010 --> 01:46:48.830]  No, Andrew said yes, he has a mustache.
[01:46:49.190 --> 01:46:50.590]  Didn't say anything about having a beard.
[01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:52.170]  Well, I wasn't asked if I have a beard.
[01:46:53.230 --> 01:46:54.930]  It's part of the mustache, or beard.
[01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:56.630]  You're fucking crazy.
[01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:58.010]  You're nuts.
[01:46:58.010 --> 01:46:59.770]  Felt like an unnecessary clarification.
[01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:02.090]  Let's go see if we can open the cage.
[01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:04.630]  Oh shit!
[01:47:06.650 --> 01:47:08.590]  Are you going to get two guesses with Yoshi?
[01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:10.250]  Oh, interesting.
[01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:13.310]  So feel good about it, whatever you're guessing.
[01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.890]  Three...
[01:47:14.890 --> 01:47:15.610]  Two.
[01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:17.050]  Why three, two?
[01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:19.630]  Oh, dog shit guess.
[01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:22.130]  Here we go.
[01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:22.970]  What do you think?
[01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:26.570]  I'm going to go with...
[01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:27.190]  18.
[01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:29.050]  Dude, if that's it, that'd be insane.
[01:47:30.130 --> 01:47:31.870]  We've yet to get a single digit right.
[01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:34.330]  There's 139 coins in there?
[01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.990]  That's crazy.
[01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.990]  That's all I want.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.240]  Who does chat think will win?
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:43.740]  I hope they think Nick.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.480]  That's a great question, actually, because we're about halfway.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:47.920]  Who do you guys think is going to win?
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:48.660]  We're two weeks in.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.820]  Oh, dear god.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.340]  Every time you get a lucky space.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:55.840]  I know!
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:56.740]  Every single time.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.260]  I know!
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:01.640]  Oh, another one!
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:02.580]  I'm right!
[01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:04.320]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:06.060]  Oh, a pipe!
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:09.260]  Nick hooked on a pipe.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.260]  I feel like that's a terrible item for this level.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.840]  Yeah, probably, right?
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.260]  Alright, let's not roll...
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.340]  the dog shit.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.400]  Does the glove...
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.600]  Does the glove give you an extra anything for travel?
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:24.680]  No.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:25.260]  Try it.
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:28.960]  I would look if anyone's ahead of me, but I don't want to look at the board.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.200]  Yeah, you've been shamed too many times.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:32.740]  One.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:35.700]  And that 10.
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:36.440]  Back on the move.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.400]  Andrew going into the board blind, not knowing what's in front of him.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.000]  That's very brave of you.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:46.600]  Yeah!
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.320]  You hanging on to that one for Nick, or what?
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:56.300]  Uh, yeah, I'm keeping both of these warm.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.940]  One under each cheek.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:48:58.920]  Aw.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:00.820]  Fuck.
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.120]  Where Yoshi was.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:04.760]  Damn.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.920]  I only had my buy lever.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:07.060]  Geoff has his.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:07.980]  I do.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:11.400]  I should've used the glove.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.300]  I should've looked at the board.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.160]  Son of a bitch!
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.720]  At least it's not a one for that.
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.540]  Oh, only three.
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.200]  Got gauzed on.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:26.040]  A little gauzing.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:27.440]  Oh no!
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.020]  Not near anyone for the glove.
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:29.980]  Ah, fuck!
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.460]  Look, a shop, Gavin!
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:34.400]  Great!
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:36.500]  Oh, cool!
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:38.800]  You're not going to that shop.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:42.400]  Okay.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:47.440]  Big ol' roll.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.460]  Show up to the board.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:48.980]  Fuck!
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:52.240]  How did you not know they were right in front of you?
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.300]  I didn't remember.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:56.920]  Oh, now everyone's in front of me.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:57.800]  It's a natural flip.
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:58.920]  Goddamn glove!
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:02.560]  Thanks, Andrew.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:03.520]  No problem.
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:09.940]  That's right.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.740]  Ah, four player.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.440]  Do you want it to be us against you?
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.780]  I did. I wanted it.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:19.040]  Treasure divers.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.400]  Everybody's going to get some money.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.260]  Keep what you find, baby!
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:27.660]  Ow!
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.500]  This is one that I used to be good at,
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.820]  but I'm no longer good at.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.360]  Oh, shit!
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.420]  DK, you're a bastard.
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:38.040]  It's the test game!
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.440]  You're dead to me already.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:41.900]  Oh, Jesus!
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:43.900]  Oh my God!
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:45.020]  Move!
[01:50:49.570 --> 01:50:50.650]  Oh, the shock!
[01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:52.190]  Oh, you little son of a bitch squid!
[01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:54.290]  I'm not getting shit.
[01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.530]  Nice.
[01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:57.670]  Oh, big one.
[01:50:58.590 --> 01:50:59.150]  Thank you.
[01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:01.230]  Mario on a tear right here.
[01:51:01.670 --> 01:51:02.950]  I just want a few coins.
[01:51:04.650 --> 01:51:05.610]  There you go.
[01:51:06.930 --> 01:51:08.290]  Take it from him.
[01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:11.390]  No!
[01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.690]  Give me that!
[01:51:13.230 --> 01:51:15.150]  No, kill him!
[01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:16.470]  It's my deals!
[01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.710]  Wow!
[01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:22.310]  That tied it.
[01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:25.630]  Ow, ow.
[01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:28.210]  My wrist.
[01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:33.690]  All right.
[01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:35.990]  Turn 15, here we come.
[01:51:36.490 --> 01:51:37.130]  Halfway!
[01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:38.730]  Beginning of week three.
[01:51:42.190 --> 01:51:43.590]  Imposter Bowser!
[01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:49.270]  There's nothing left.
[01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:51.550]  Yeah, it's bad.
[01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:53.670]  Oh, I hate where I am.
[01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.750]  Jesus!
[01:51:58.590 --> 01:52:00.130]  Moisturize seagull with the prime sub.
[01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:00.670]  Thank you.
[01:52:00.710 --> 01:52:01.570]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:04.870]  Watch me roll under four.
[01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:06.570]  Nice.
[01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:08.490]  Nice job, Geoff.
[01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:09.590]  You think you'll buy it?
[01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:10.010]  Yep.
[01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.510]  Nah.
[01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:16.650]  Yeah, I think I'll get it.
[01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:23.610]  Back on the board.
[01:52:23.630 --> 01:52:24.850]  Oh, I'm gonna have to think of shit.
[01:52:26.630 --> 01:52:28.190]  Are we gonna do a halfway shit break?
[01:52:28.330 --> 01:52:29.150]  We might have to do a shit break.
[01:52:29.150 --> 01:52:30.170]  Oh, come on.
[01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:31.590]  Leave my mic on, though.
[01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:32.110]  No!
[01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:34.330]  Something else.
[01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:37.690]  I'm gonna guess now, something else.
[01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:40.790]  Fill that fucking bowl.
[01:52:41.210 --> 01:52:42.770]  Hold the turds in till later.
[01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:44.630]  How do you do those doors?
[01:52:45.690 --> 01:52:46.430]  You gotta get a key.
[01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:48.230]  You can buy those keys.
[01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:51.050]  You need a key.
[01:52:53.230 --> 01:52:55.010]  How do I wanna play this?
[01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:55.930]  Oh, that's a great question.
[01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.910]  I would use the controller.
[01:52:57.950 --> 01:53:00.590]  Oh, problem solved.
[01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:03.070]  Let's just have some fun.
[01:53:03.310 --> 01:53:04.070]  I'm gonna run and take a pee.
[01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:05.710]  Does anybody need anything from the kitchen while I'm up?
[01:53:06.010 --> 01:53:06.290]  No.
[01:53:07.050 --> 01:53:08.530]  I'll take one of the Waterloo's, please.
[01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:09.910]  Fuck.
[01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:11.750]  Definitely should mute Geoff.
[01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:12.170]  Yeah, I done.
[01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:13.150]  Yeah, I done.
[01:53:14.530 --> 01:53:16.070]  Look, I gave it back to you guys.
[01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:17.230]  To the people.
[01:53:21.130 --> 01:53:22.310]  Roll more than one.
[01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.790]  I'd love to buy a double item.
[01:53:31.410 --> 01:53:32.690]  Yeah, you get a double item, don't you?
[01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:33.510]  Sweet.
[01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:36.910]  This is still anyone's game.
[01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.950]  Yeah, really, big time.
[01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:41.610]  Especially with all the Bowser squares and everything locking up.
[01:53:41.610 --> 01:53:42.250]  Crazy.
[01:53:42.610 --> 01:53:43.810]  It's gonna turn into a nightmare.
[01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:49.290]  You know what? I'm having fun with these.
[01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:53.790]  A lot of people saying that
[01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:55.130]  Geoff's mic is not muted.
[01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:59.310]  Is that pretty exciting?
[01:53:59.710 --> 01:54:00.350]  He's muted.
[01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:02.830]  Are you sure?
[01:54:03.590 --> 01:54:06.070]  His mic...
[01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.290]  Nope.
[01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.710]  I don't hear anything.
[01:54:07.710 --> 01:54:08.810]  No, me neither.
[01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:11.230]  Is there like a separate line?
[01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:13.270]  Fingers crossed.
[01:54:13.810 --> 01:54:14.590]  That'd be cool.
[01:54:15.090 --> 01:54:15.630]  Hopefully not.
[01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:19.150]  Yeah, a lot of people saying definitely not muted.
[01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:22.650]  He's muted on our end.
[01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:26.530]  People saying heard the piss.
[01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:28.510]  Did they really?
[01:54:29.150 --> 01:54:30.670]  Geoff, say something quietly.
[01:54:31.170 --> 01:54:34.030]  Hey, what's up? It's Geoff. I just peed all over the place.
[01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:36.390]  Geoff, say something quietly.
[01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:39.230]  I just did a super piss.
[01:54:41.890 --> 01:54:42.690]  I don't know.
[01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:44.930]  Yeah, we heard him. Not muted.
[01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.190]  He's not muted.
[01:54:47.410 --> 01:54:48.650]  Just did some hard piss.
[01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:50.370]  I just did a super piss.
[01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:53.810]  Well, he's not muted.
[01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:56.090]  How was I muted?
[01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.870]  I don't know.
[01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:57.910]  Was I muted?
[01:54:58.130 --> 01:54:59.790]  I didn't hear you in our headphones.
[01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:01.230]  We didn't hear anything in the headphones.
[01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:03.670]  So it's bypassing us straight to Twitch?
[01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:04.090]  That.
[01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:07.870]  How about now?
[01:55:09.010 --> 01:55:09.670]  What about now?
[01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:11.510]  Geoff, say something.
[01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:14.570]  I hear you.
[01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:16.170]  Okay, so we can hear him now.
[01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:17.430]  But they shouldn't be able to hear him.
[01:55:17.670 --> 01:55:18.630]  You're just muting our headphones.
[01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:21.590]  I was muting the main mix, I guess.
[01:55:21.690 --> 01:55:21.950]  What?
[01:55:22.890 --> 01:55:24.450]  Muted. People are saying he's muted.
[01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:25.130]  Okay, sweet.
[01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:27.390]  Alright, well, we figured it out.
[01:55:30.650 --> 01:55:31.130]  What?
[01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:33.930]  Oh, this is personal.
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:36.190]  This is a personal attack.
[01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:37.150]  No, I do not pee quietly.
[01:55:39.490 --> 01:55:41.130]  I'm a loud pisser.
[01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:44.030]  I piss like I mean it.
[01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:45.170]  Gavin, why?
[01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:47.270]  Oh, that won't be in the...
[01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:48.110]  It's fun.
[01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:49.950]  Fun? Okay.
[01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:50.790]  I liked it.
[01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:51.770]  Thank you for this.
[01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:53.330]  Sorry about that.
[01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:56.930]  Oh, don't worry, dude. It's that apology to the audience on me.
[01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:58.630]  You didn't mute the piss
[01:55:58.630 --> 01:56:00.250]  of the one guy who records his own pisses.
[01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:03.030]  Can I get up there, please?
[01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:04.590]  Slow down.
[01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:05.630]  Can I get up there, please?
[01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:07.490]  For God's sake!
[01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:09.290]  Why you guys stop?
[01:56:10.130 --> 01:56:11.250]  Gavin, what the fuck?
[01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:12.990]  Gavin, are you fucking dumb?
[01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:16.090]  What is wrong with you?
[01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:17.370]  Go, go, go!
[01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.350]  What is...
[01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:19.030]  Go, go, go!
[01:56:20.690 --> 01:56:22.210]  Go, go, go!
[01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:25.130]  Go, go, go!
[01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:26.230]  Gavin!
[01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:27.210]  Go, go, go!
[01:56:29.130 --> 01:56:30.370]  Don't mute his shit.
[01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:31.790]  Are you fucking stupid?
[01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:33.670]  What is wrong with you?
[01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:36.430]  What the fuck was that?
[01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:38.750]  Gavin!
[01:56:40.190 --> 01:56:40.750]  81!
[01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:43.510]  That's what you get!
[01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:45.210]  I gave him 40 coins!
[01:56:45.370 --> 01:56:46.870]  Give me all your coins!
[01:56:48.110 --> 01:56:48.530]  You're...
[01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.130]  The timing, I just couldn't get out of it.
[01:56:51.230 --> 01:56:52.250]  I couldn't get out of hell.
[01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.910]  80!
[01:56:54.670 --> 01:56:56.670]  Oh, it's a good day for the Dilkotomy!
[01:56:57.670 --> 01:56:58.710]  That was...
[01:56:58.710 --> 01:56:59.210]  Gavin.
[01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:03.810]  The idiot flags are insane right now.
[01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:05.570]  That was the worst performance
[01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:06.390]  I've ever seen.
[01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:08.470]  That was worse than Andrew during the launch.
[01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:10.070]  That was so bad.
[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.090]  What?
[01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:14.050]  I didn't even need to be in front of anyone
[01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:15.890]  to use the glove anyway.
[01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.910]  Moron.
[01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:18.830]  I just...
[01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:21.510]  You're gonna reverse the polarity.
[01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:23.370]  Or leave and not get the star.
[01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:25.730]  Where is the star?
[01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:28.470]  Right there.
[01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:29.190]  Behind you.
[01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:31.810]  So I'm gonna give it to Andrew?
[01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:33.390]  No, he can't get it.
[01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:35.130]  He can't do it.
[01:57:35.150 --> 01:57:37.090]  He can't get it.
[01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:38.990]  If he rolls high enough.
[01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.910]  Yeah, he won't.
[01:57:40.150 --> 01:57:42.550]  I'm gonna land on a Bowser space is what I'm gonna do.
[01:57:44.770 --> 01:57:45.730]  Yeah, that's...
[01:57:45.730 --> 01:57:46.970]  Man, it sucks to suck.
[01:57:48.590 --> 01:57:50.190]  Bowser charged the erection.
[01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:52.070]  What?
[01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:54.230]  Andrew said something about an erection.
[01:57:55.710 --> 01:57:57.370]  Bowser charged the erection.
[01:57:57.890 --> 01:57:58.950]  That is a lot of flavor
[01:57:58.950 --> 01:58:00.390]  for no caffeine and sugar.
[01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:01.930]  Happy birthday, Erectus.
[01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:02.610]  Thanks, Chemical.
[01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:03.510]  Fuck!
[01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:06.090]  What did he roll?
[01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.770]  Two.
[01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:09.850]  Didn't even get to the Bowser.
[01:58:10.690 --> 01:58:11.550]  Excuse me.
[01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:12.530]  That was a good one.
[01:58:13.210 --> 01:58:14.990]  Oh, damn.
[01:58:16.710 --> 01:58:17.970]  That's the money dice.
[01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:20.690]  Is that your drill
[01:58:20.690 --> 01:58:22.130]  we've been using around the office, Gavin?
[01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:22.670]  The DeWalt?
[01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:25.130]  You like my drill?
[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:26.970]  Dude, is that your claw hammer too?
[01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:29.670]  Man, I gotta stop buying cheap tools.
[01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.210]  You may not know this about me,
[01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:32.830]  but I'm a big DeWalt guy.
[01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:36.010]  I got sucked in early on, and I've just gone all in on DeWalt.
[01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:37.670]  Everybody has their one...
[01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:38.730]  I was talking about this recently.
[01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:41.790]  Everybody has their one tool brand that they ride or die for.
[01:58:41.850 --> 01:58:43.690]  I feel like people also really like Milwaukee.
[01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.570]  Milwaukee and Bosch are my go-tos.
[01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:47.290]  Bosch.
[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:49.410]  Yeah, I'm probably
[01:58:50.710 --> 01:58:51.710]  10, 11 years
[01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:53.330]  deep into DeWalt.
[01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:55.530]  DeWalt used to be
[01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:57.370]  the white label
[01:58:57.370 --> 01:58:59.190]  flagship brand of Black & Decker.
[01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:01.730]  Is that the same company?
[01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:03.510]  Yeah, I don't know if it still is, but it was.
[01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:05.690]  It was like Black & Decker made a prestige brand
[01:59:05.690 --> 01:59:06.250]  and it was DeWalt.
[01:59:06.690 --> 01:59:08.750]  Or they bought it and made it a prestige brand.
[01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:10.330]  Mario, come on.
[01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:11.770]  The jump button is really delayed.
[01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:15.010]  And Andrew's just jumping like a maniac.
[01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:16.430]  Trying to box people out.
[01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:18.090]  It's working.
[01:59:18.690 --> 01:59:19.530]  Box yourself out.
[01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:23.590]  Damn it, Geoff.
[01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:24.550]  You suck.
[01:59:25.730 --> 01:59:26.570]  Ha!
[01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.970]  The bats!
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:33.400]  Oh!
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:34.980]  Oh my god.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:37.020]  Milwaukee gang.
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:38.080]  Did we drop frames?
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:39.320]  No!
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:44.180]  Victory for DeWalt!
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:45.600]  DeWalt!
[01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.680]  I can't do this today.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.220]  You are awful.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:51.360]  No!
[01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:54.420]  Well, now you've got time to talk more about DeWalt.
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.740]  Yeah, the floor's yours.
[01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:01.120]  They sucked me in.
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:02.580]  They suck you off.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.920]  Still got a lot of penance left.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:09.300]  Fuck.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:10.740]  Two turns.
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:14.920]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of penance left.
[02:00:14.940 --> 02:00:16.480]  I didn't kill Yoshi to win this time.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.440]  I don't know what that means.
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:19.500]  Maybe they'll last the whole of year too.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.200]  In the flop section?
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:23.840]  Yeah, in the flop zone all year.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.240]  Yeah.
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.980]  We should see if we can wallpaper a room with them.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:32.340]  If they don't sell, we will.
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:33.040]  We'll have to, yeah.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.660]  That could be how we store them.
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:39.560]  All right.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:45.280]  Not muting Geoff when he took a super piss is so crazy.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:46.140]  Yeah, my bad.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:48.600]  I pissed hard. That was a big yellow piss too.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:48.880]  So insane.
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.040]  I am not hydrated today.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.680]  The one thing we do, because the one is the main feed,
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:53.740]  which is what we hear,
[02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:55.860]  and also what is on that device,
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.660]  what's being fed to the stream is aux 1.
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.240]  Yeah, you know.
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.200]  Because if it's on aux 1,
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.860]  they don't hear Andrew off aux 1.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:05.540]  Exactly.
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.800]  But why wouldn't main be the stream?
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.200]  Right.
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.020]  Because Andrew would get our feed.
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:11.740]  Yeah.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.140]  Because Andrew would hear himself twice.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:18.180]  I agree with you.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:20.080]  Instead of 4,000 people
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:20.820]  got to hear me piss.
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:23.720]  People are asking,
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.260]  where did Andrew Robot go?
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:27.880]  He's taking care of the iPad.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:30.040]  Yeah, he's making sure we can hear Geoff piss.
[02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:32.180]  I think maybe Andrew just
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:32.800]  unmuted it.
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.780]  We should give Andrew
[02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:37.680]  little poking fingers so he can touch it.
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.220]  I was just thinking, I want to upgrade
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:41.980]  Andrew. We need to find the version
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.860]  above this that is self-docking.
[02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:45.880]  That charges itself. Because this one,
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.820]  you gotta plug in. I'd love for Andrew
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:49.720]  to be able to wake up in the morning,
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.940]  unplug himself, go out into the day,
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:53.380]  and at the end of the day,
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.680]  like a Roomba, return to home.
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:01:59.800]  Ooh, you got flamed.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:00.360]  I got fired.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.280]  So this is to keep an eye on your dog
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.500]  or something? Is that what this is?
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:07.880]  Yeah, it's like a pet thing.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.620]  Great find, Geoff.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:11.120]  Pet camera.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:12.280]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:13.520]  I feel like my dog would rip that shit.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.320]  I believe my wife found it on TikTok.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:18.140]  And she goes, you should buy this and make it Andrew.
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:20.360]  And I went, we should really put you
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:20.940]  in charge of the company.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.960]  Wait, when did I get dice blocked?
[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:24.820]  Nowhere, no one. Nick did.
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:28.500]  Can you guess?
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:29.420]  No.
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:31.620]  Why don't we make it random?
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.180]  Pure unadulterated chance.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:36.780]  He just did it.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.800]  He already has one.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:40.720]  Can they stack?
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:41.540]  Oh.
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:43.260]  Piece of shit.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:45.520]  No.
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:48.860]  Damn it.
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.000]  Piece of shit.
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:52.860]  I knew I should have bought the shroom instead of accidentally buying another one of these.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:54.500]  Three.
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:56.080]  Three's good.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.000]  Bowser.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.220]  Hope you lose a star, you fuck.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:01.520]  Money well spent.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:04.880]  Oh, I'd love one now.
[02:03:06.380 --> 02:03:07.180]  Oh, no.
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.080]  Not a star steal.
[02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:12.020]  This game's about to get dangerous.
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:14.260]  Let me look at the star while I get bows.
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:15.620]  We got another hype train going.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:16.280]  Thank you to everyone.
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:17.580]  Thank you so much.
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.640]  One day a hype train.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.320]  Incredible anniversary.
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.840]  What's the highest level hype train?
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.620]  I don't think there's a limit.
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:27.400]  That we've ever had.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.480]  Probably like 15, I'm not sure.
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.240]  If we get to hype level 30, I'll piss again.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.600]  But you won't hear it this time.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.860]  No, you will hear it again.
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.160]  If we get to 30, Geoff will do it on camera.
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:39.180]  No.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:40.260]  What?
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:43.200]  All right.
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:46.140]  You said that in Nojo's 81 gifted tensor.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.000]  What did he slap away?
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:49.380]  What?
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:52.500]  Oh.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.480]  So he just took it.
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:57.600]  He just took it to that hole.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:59.420]  Holy fucking shit.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.080]  Wow.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.520]  Gavin is going to...
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.980]  He knocked the options out of the way.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:06.080]  Gavin quit the game.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:07.520]  I'm going to pee.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:08.900]  Mute it or don't.
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:11.900]  Can you mute it on both sides?
[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.020]  Why don't you crank that up?
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:15.660]  It's muted on both.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:19.040]  Do you want to hear the difference between American and British piss?
[02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:20.120]  Oh, sorry.
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:23.460]  I'm sorry, Mr. Toy in the Boat.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.780]  You got whiz on you.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.120]  Gavin's missing it.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:27.780]  Oh, no.
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:29.920]  Gavin is going to get the star you should have had.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.040]  We're laughing like those fucking weasels in the cartoons.
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.440]  God, that's so funny.
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:47.980]  Thank you.
[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:50.300]  Oh, no, it's a Bowser, right?
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:52.240]  It's going to be Bowser.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:53.580]  Yep.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:55.240]  It's going to be bad, sir.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:56.840]  Uh-oh.
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.240]  Hey, I got a star.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.180]  Now let's see what happens.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:03.680]  Well, I inadvertently
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:05.660]  gave myself more work on this
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:06.640]  VOD.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:07.460]  Yeah.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.160]  Cool.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:12.680]  Store's still open, everybody.
[02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:15.040]  This VOD will be out
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.700]  if Nick says it's okay, it'll be out Thursday.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:18.680]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:20.900]  Might have to do some de-pissing.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:22.580]  Yeah, I gotta do some de-pissing.
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:25.460]  Oh, no, he threw it away!
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:26.960]  He's taking a star!
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.520]  I just bought this!
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:31.300]  Unmute Gavin.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.980]  He just bought a star, landed on a Bowser's face,
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.140]  and lost a star.
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:39.240]  So he just lost all his coins.
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.600]  You guys need to hurry up and crack the code
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.300]  for that vault.
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.460]  Did he get there?
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:49.960]  God damn it!
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:51.300]  What made it better
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.300]  is that you could hear it.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.240]  Now I'm partnered with this dickhead?
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:55.440]  God damn it!
[02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:58.180]  You keep trying to attack me!
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.000]  We got this.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:06.160]  Okay, Gavin.
[02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:06.940]  Gavin?
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:09.180]  Yeah, big time.
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:10.980]  You guys are fucked.
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:13.100]  He got it.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:14.760]  He just went on Wario.
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:17.060]  Yeah, I mean, we don't even need to communicate.
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:17.660]  It's easy.
[02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:20.340]  Yeah, you guys don't need to communicate.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.720]  We can do this wordless.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:24.040]  We are.
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:29.360]  Lock on.
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:30.020]  Locked in.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:31.600]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:33.960]  What are you doing?
[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:35.460]  Nick, hold A!
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.040]  What?
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.320]  Nick, you're killing me.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:41.700]  I know.
[02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:47.040]  What are you doing?
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:49.780]  Every time!
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.080]  He's hitting the button so late.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.920]  He was hitting it so late.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:06:59.380]  There you go.
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.080]  Good job.
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.500]  Good job.
[02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:03.940]  We're right here.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.800]  We're right here.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:08.400]  Gavin was here.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.160]  I was watching him do it and just going,
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:11.200]  no fucking way.
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:13.660]  So late on the button press.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:14.780]  So late.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:16.980]  Can you not get on the way down?
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:18.360]  You can.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.200]  So I was simultaneously late for one
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:23.120]  and early for the next.
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.440]  I'm gonna poo my pants today.
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.680]  Speaking of which, let's fill you up with sugar.
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:33.560]  There's cake in there.
[02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:35.440]  Oh, we should cut the cake in a little while.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:38.000]  Should we do a turn 20 cake break?
[02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:38.320]  Yeah!
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.180]  Turn 20 cake break?
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:41.160]  Yeah.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:45.400]  Guys, thank you for joining us on this anniversary.
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:46.840]  It's been a lot of fun so far.
[02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.760]  We got three more turns and we're gonna cut the cake
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:51.540]  that says happy birthday Erectus.
[02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:55.560]  If you missed the little office tour we did,
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:56.580]  it'll be on the vlog.
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:58.400]  We'll stick it up separate maybe.
[02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:01.300]  So where is the fucking star?
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:02.160]  It's over there.
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.880]  So these dickheads right here are on their way, huh?
[02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:06.220]  Getting that star.
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:06.720]  Yeah.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.540]  How do you know that?
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:09.840]  He looked at you.
[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:13.540]  Grady got jobs in the fight zones.
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:15.600]  Oh, Geoff.
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:16.960]  Oh, Geoff.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:20.040]  Oh, Geoff.
[02:08:20.180 --> 02:08:21.400]  Oh, Geoff.
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:22.180]  Hello.
[02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:24.880]  You have to roll like a 1, 2, 3.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:27.880]  You have to roll a 7 or higher to get out of this.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:28.440]  You got it!
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.100]  Just roll a 1, 2, 3. Go for it.
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:32.040]  I can't because I can only roll a 1, 2, 3.
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.500]  But at least now they're further away from the star.
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:38.940]  Bowser has a mouth as merciful.
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:40.660]  No, he's been a bad Bowser.
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:42.880]  I have a feeling he might just be taking the star from you.
[02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:44.620]  God, I gotta get in that ball.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.260]  Oh, wow. You're lucky.
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:46.980]  Oh.
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:48.440]  No!
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:50.760]  Actually, that's fine.
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:54.120]  That's fine for me.
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:56.180]  It's fine for me too.
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.280]  Not so great for Nick.
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:08:59.760]  No, it's fine.
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.640]  I'd be more worried about Andrew.
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:05.040]  Mark the frog.
[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:05.480]  No way!
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.540]  It's also a bunch of dudes in their 40s can still muck around and enjoy some video games together.
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:13.840]  Some of us are approaching their 50s, thank you.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:16.200]  I'm pretty sure it's 30s and 50s.
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:23.880]  Oh, what a...
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.560]  How did Bernie get to retire and I'm still doing it?
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:28.740]  It's so unfair.
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.460]  Do you want to retire?
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:31.040]  No!
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:33.020]  You know how lame that is?
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:38.320]  I'd much rather get paid to be 15 years old for the rest of my life.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:42.300]  Can you by any chance stop chucking this bullshit into my dice?
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:42.600]  What is it?
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.360]  What is it?
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:47.100]  I've been dribbling for a week in this game.
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:48.320]  Oh, shit.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.940]  Well, I deserve everything coming to me.
[02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:52.940]  It's coming on you.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:53.800]  No!
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.780]  Ooh, that's not going to do it.
[02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:57.240]  What?
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:09:58.840]  He got him.
[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:04.040]  It has lights that tell you how many you have to do.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:06.760]  He was thinking that one, past Bowser.
[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:08.200]  Oh, no.
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:10.100]  Bowser's going to fuck me.
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:11.280]  I don't know.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.620]  Take a star!
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:15.420]  Damn it.
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:17.160]  Oh!
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:20.040]  That's pretty rough.
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:20.780]  That's a lot.
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:21.880]  Especially after a revolution.
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:23.520]  That's a lot to lose all at once.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:24.800]  You know what else is a lot to lose?
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:27.140]  A star that you don't even have a choice for.
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.520]  He still has four stars.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:31.680]  Still holding on to that, huh?
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.540]  Oh, Andrew can shake.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.900]  There's so much misery in your present.
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.020]  All right, let's throw some shite.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:41.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:43.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:44.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:46.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:48.020]  We're the weasels again.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:52.020]  Yeah, yeah, good luck, bad luck.
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:52.640]  It's fun.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.620]  There you go.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:56.440]  I like it.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:10:59.800]  It's kind of like hope, but not.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:04.980]  Kind of like hope, but not.
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:05.220]  All right.
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.140]  Cool.
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:09.740]  Actually, that's fine.
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:13.460]  I probably saved you is what I did.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:14.980]  Oh, cool, some of these.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:19.020]  I thought you wanted the mushroom.
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.480]  Fuck the mushroom.
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:23.460]  Did I not buy that?
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:24.700]  Buy it.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  Did I try to?
[02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.540]  Don't be stupid.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.020]  Oh, I said not right now.
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:32.980]  I just was...
[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:33.240]  Okay.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:36.580]  You just was okay?
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:38.340]  I just was okay.
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.160]  Do you think you're going to win?
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.000]  No.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.240]  Why?
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:44.940]  There's cat piss in here.
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:47.360]  That's...
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.560]  You know what? That's fair.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.880]  If I just put these all over the freaking floor...
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:54.020]  Oh!
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:56.540]  Oh, you have to make a choice.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.520]  Oh, you have to make a real choice.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.820]  Real Sophie's Choice here.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.100]  Which child are you going to kill?
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:05.020]  Oh, interesting.
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:06.460]  I think that's an insane move.
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:09.140]  I don't want to get my stars from the official means.
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:10.420]  I want them from the ground.
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.900]  Let's look at the board for a sec.
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:13.520]  Okay.
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:16.800]  You're touching grass for real?
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:22.060]  Oh, big ol' three.
[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:23.860]  Is that on your star?
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:26.140]  Boy, that was close.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.640]  What is he going to get?
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.660]  I can't believe you didn't use an item before you did this.
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:36.640]  I wasn't sure if yours would block out my item.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:37.520]  My dice block.
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.320]  Oh, it might.
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.080]  But you didn't try.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.100]  Why would you buy one of them?
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:46.520]  Because I want one.
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:48.600]  Wait.
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:50.640]  Wait, you threw away your money dice?
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.120]  Yep, don't need it. I got so much money.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.360]  And now you're going to have...
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:55.580]  I want you to remember that.
[02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:57.340]  I think you had a good choice.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:02.660]  Fuck!
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:04.960]  The same exact position.
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:08.340]  This guy's nuts.
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.660]  I can't believe you didn't try to use an item before doing this.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:16.000]  Yeah, I should have used the money dice.
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:19.460]  You're going to need some idiot flags.
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:20.660]  Yeah, we're going to need some...
[02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:22.160]  Oh, I can already see him.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:23.980]  Hot cross blocks.
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.600]  My favorite.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:27.860]  What's going on in chat?
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:29.280]  Oh, I want idiot flags.
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:29.940]  Oh, nice.
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:32.540]  Oh, this one.
[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:35.260]  This is the donuts.
[02:13:40.070 --> 02:13:41.690]  Can someone only have one?
[02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:42.390]  Can what?
[02:13:43.650 --> 02:13:45.110]  Yes, to answer your question.
[02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.230]  Yes, you can only...
[02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:48.690]  You should just set the controller down.
[02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:48.970]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.850 --> 02:13:52.430]  Oh!
[02:13:55.730 --> 02:13:56.310]  Interesting.
[02:13:56.730 --> 02:13:57.030]  Not good.
[02:13:57.190 --> 02:13:58.190]  Not good at all.
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:03.230]  No!
[02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:04.690]  Fuck off!
[02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:08.790]  Oh, boy.
[02:14:11.850 --> 02:14:12.710]  Oh, my God.
[02:14:12.710 --> 02:14:14.790]  The one I actually wanted was available.
[02:14:15.110 --> 02:14:16.750]  Then why didn't you pick the one you wanted?
[02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:19.130]  Because I thought everyone would. I thought everyone was smart.
[02:14:20.010 --> 02:14:21.350]  Are you...
[02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:22.870]  Are you trying to insult me right now?
[02:14:23.090 --> 02:14:23.310]  Yeah.
[02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:26.170]  It's still there for free!
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:32.080]  Insane.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:33.860]  I only have one option here.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:35.620]  Are you serious?
[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:39.220]  There's one playable thing for me.
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.780]  This is the worst game of Wario Party.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:41.380]  This sucks.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:44.240]  I'm going for the future on this one.
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.280]  Why do you even want to pick that one?
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:49.720]  I did it because no one else would.
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:52.560]  Oh, boy.
[02:14:54.460 --> 02:14:55.420]  Oh, boy.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:55.960]  Why?
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.720]  Nick, why?
[02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:58.320]  Why?
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:02.960]  If you pick this, I'm going to...
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:04.520]  Oh, we don't get one!
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:06.460]  That's future-proofed.
[02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:07.660]  Now I can go anywhere.
[02:15:14.260 --> 02:15:15.180]  Come on, Geoff.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:16.860]  Pick smart.
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:17.420]  Wow!
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:18.280]  Yeah.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.320]  There we go.
[02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:21.960]  Okay.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:22.960]  Okay.
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:26.480]  Oh, shit.
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:28.460]  That's Turbo Yakuza.
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:30.960]  You know what? Fair play.
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:31.540]  Yeah.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.560]  Give me that one.
[02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:37.780]  Come on, please.
[02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:40.120]  Oh, shit.
[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:41.460]  We both could have taken the one we wanted.
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:43.500]  Get me there.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.280]  No, no, no.
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:47.320]  No, no, no.
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:48.400]  I'll block it.
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:49.720]  No, Nick!
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:52.880]  Uh-oh.
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:54.280]  Give me some choices.
[02:15:55.220 --> 02:15:56.420]  Uh-oh, Gavin.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:57.940]  Oh, my God.
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.440]  I'm going for it!
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:02.460]  Well, now you've screamed it.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:03.060]  I'm not.
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:05.560]  I'm not.
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:07.520]  That's a problem.
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:09.720]  That's real bad for us.
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.960]  He went with the bottom one.
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:15.040]  Oh, shit!
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:16.460]  Suck it, Gavin!
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:20.660]  Dilkong, come back.
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.900]  Oh, fuck!
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:23.980]  Dilkong, come back.
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:25.660]  Andrew, you can do it right here.
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:26.600]  Dilkong, come, John.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.400]  Dil! Dil! Dil! Dil!
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.160]  We did it!
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:33.900]  Monkey mode!
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.120]  Great.
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:38.960]  Dil!
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:40.820]  What happened?
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.580]  I'm happy for the Dilkong.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.140]  Andrew, do some robot celebrations.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.080]  Do some robots!
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:49.900]  It's not...
[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:51.160]  Oh, it might be off.
[02:16:51.260 --> 02:16:52.560]  One sec. It's resyncing.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:53.640]  Okay.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:55.540]  One sec. It's waking up.
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:57.400]  I'm back!
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:16:59.180]  Go for the jump!
[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:03.920]  Robot celebration!
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:06.620]  A little bit too much jump.
[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:07.200]  Ow!
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:12.620]  I'm trying to get out of here. Sorry, I'm in the feet.
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:13.280]  I'm in the feet.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:15.360]  How did that carpet get so...
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:18.080]  I don't know. I think everyone's been kicking it forward.
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:20.400]  We should probably put down some of that tape.
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:20.920]  Yeah.
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:23.060]  Whoa, Andrew.
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:30.120]  Oh, my God.
[02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:33.540]  And this is the pee one.
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:35.680]  He's trying to mute it again.
[02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:39.460]  Alright, here we go, Monty Mole. Let's kick some ass.
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:43.420]  Oh, you can just teleport to a shop.
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:45.920]  Yeah, he should do that for sure.
[02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:46.740]  No kidding.
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:48.040]  Pissing off.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:50.500]  See ya!
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:52.720]  Nick has four stars.
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:53.920]  Crazy.
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:58.440]  That was probably the worst shop to wind up at.
[02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:02.700]  Okay.
[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:04.100]  Oh, damn.
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.880]  Oh, it's going to reverse the polarity.
[02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:11.060]  What do I want?
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:14.120]  We're just going to start littering.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.040]  No!
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:18.040]  I'm going to have to stay away from the square.
[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:21.540]  This is how we get his stars.
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:23.720]  We bait him back into the hell square.
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:25.860]  Ow!
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:29.160]  Hahaha!
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.360]  Oh, he got out!
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:35.380]  Interesting.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.360]  He's trying to climb.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.420]  Oh, 15 coins.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:45.060]  It can jump back surprisingly well.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:46.700]  It's so cool.
[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:47.700]  Yeah, it's pretty rad.
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.560]  It's one of the only instances
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.520]  where a TikTok ad
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:53.600]  has been for a real product.
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:55.800]  Oh, wow.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:57.740]  Get me out of here.
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:18:59.120]  Uh-oh.
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:18:59.700]  Uh-oh.
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.260]  Oh, no!
[02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:05.300]  Oh, this is bad for me.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.780]  He's just staring at you.
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:09.260]  Keep attacking me!
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.780]  I got my eyes on you.
[02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:12.940]  Andrew's watching me.
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:20.200]  Man, he's really taking my money.
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:21.040]  Yeah, it's brutal.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.640]  Andrew's staring at us.
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:24.480]  I'm just watching.
[02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.930]  Okay.
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:36.170]  Let's put something down.
[02:19:37.090 --> 02:19:37.770]  Or don't.
[02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:38.990]  You don't have to.
[02:19:39.630 --> 02:19:41.190]  Or let's.
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:43.670]  Let's place.
[02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:46.150]  Let's place.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:50.880]  Perfect.
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.380]  It feels tropical.
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:54.860]  It looks tropical.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:56.420]  I wanna try one.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:57.980]  It's pretty good.
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:01.940]  Wow!
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:04.520]  Wouldn't it be cool if
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:06.820]  a 7-up level brand came to us
[02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.880]  and was like, we want you
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.340]  to make us feel tropical.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.120]  Damn right.
[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:14.880]  We were on the fence about it
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:16.320]  then I see that you got a robot
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.860]  and boy, do we need that robot
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:19.600]  to be tropical.
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:22.700]  Aloha, Andrew.
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:25.720]  We're gonna give you one of those
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:28.840]  7-figure deals you always hear about on the internet.
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:30.500]  Yep, for the podcast?
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:30.960]  Absolutely.
[02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:35.360]  You gonna try your luck?
[02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:37.360]  Whoa.
[02:20:38.200 --> 02:20:38.640]  28?
[02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:42.200]  Yeah, but think about if you get it right.
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:44.600]  Think about if you get it right.
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:45.580]  Are you?
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.220]  Think about if you get it right.
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:49.500]  No, no, no.
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:51.620]  Let's look at the board.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:52.340]  Is Boo this way?
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:53.360]  No.
[02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:55.660]  No, he's back the other...
[02:20:55.660 --> 02:20:59.720]  Oh, hey, what's up, giant bastard?
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:00.820]  One.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:06.000]  You suck.
[02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:09.700]  Five coins, you suck.
[02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:14.220]  Hey, lucky!
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:14.920]  Hey!
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:17.100]  What a roll.
[02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.560]  Oh, you got a key!
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:22.780]  That's very interesting.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:23.820]  I got room for it now.
[02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:25.420]  Give me that key.
[02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:26.200]  What is it?
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:27.140]  Yeah.
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:30.680]  Die spot.
[02:21:31.020 --> 02:21:32.280]  Oh, here we go.
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:34.340]  Hell yeah, baby.
[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:36.220]  Can you replace Gavin's?
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:37.960]  No, you can't.
[02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:39.340]  Damn.
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:40.340]  Damn.
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:42.320]  Oh, God, an exit one.
[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:45.780]  I don't think it counts for you now, though.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:46.860]  Number one.
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:47.840]  Shit.
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:22:04.420]  Oh, now big decision.
[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:07.040]  I'm gonna go this way.
[02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:08.820]  Nice.
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:10.280]  That's the exciting way.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:12.660]  Oh, wait, there's stars in there?
[02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.660]  That's where the stolen stars go.
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:15.880]  I fucking said that.
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:18.240]  Nick was trying to shine it in my ear.
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.720]  He was poisoning my mind.
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:24.800]  He was poisoning my mind.
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:25.920]  It's all of the stuff.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.580]  Here we go.
[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:29.200]  Worm tongue, motherfucker.
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:31.320]  Suck!
[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:32.700]  Oh, poor Denethor.
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:36.820]  Oh, no.
[02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:38.520]  Oh, no, it's Gavin.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:39.680]  This is Gavin's.
[02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:41.100]  This is not good.
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:44.060]  Gavin, just remember which one you have and then do it.
[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:46.360]  I've got the star.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:46.840]  Okay.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:49.360]  Yeah, we gotta see.
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:52.280]  This is great.
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:53.220]  Oh, fuck.
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:55.220]  Yeah, big time.
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.780]  There's a lot of me there, though.
[02:23:08.810 --> 02:23:09.690]  Not a lot of me.
[02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:11.170]  Uh-oh.
[02:23:11.690 --> 02:23:12.490]  Uh-oh.
[02:23:12.690 --> 02:23:12.930]  Here we go.
[02:23:13.810 --> 02:23:15.430]  Fast. It's happening.
[02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.590]  Oh, no!
[02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:17.470]  Sorry.
[02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:23.010]  Neck and neck!
[02:23:23.410 --> 02:23:24.610]  Neck and neck!
[02:23:26.470 --> 02:23:27.450]  Square in the middle!
[02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:28.430]  Oh, it tied!
[02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:29.990]  It might be a tie.
[02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:31.930]  It might be a tie.
[02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:33.330]  What?
[02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.990]  Oh, no!
[02:23:37.690 --> 02:23:39.770]  How are you so good at that?
[02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:41.630]  It's because Geoff blew that one.
[02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:42.630]  I fucked one up.
[02:23:44.010 --> 02:23:46.730]  Honestly, when I'm solo on that, I get, like, 18.
[02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:48.830]  Oh, my brain hurts so bad.
[02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.410]  What was that?
[02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:53.430]  Eli Benj, again.
[02:23:53.650 --> 02:23:55.050]  The Benj monster!
[02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:57.970]  Thank you, Eli Benj!
[02:23:58.510 --> 02:24:00.530]  Eli, thanks for your anniversary Benj.
[02:24:02.390 --> 02:24:03.170]  Oh, God.
[02:24:03.310 --> 02:24:05.230]  My brain hurts after that turn.
[02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:07.090]  That was so good. I can't believe you did that.
[02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:09.250]  Only one more turn, and then we open the cake.
[02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:12.110]  And then this is going to be me.
[02:24:12.670 --> 02:24:13.730]  Oh, you're going to put it on your head?
[02:24:13.890 --> 02:24:15.570]  Yeah, I'm a little Fiesta guy.
[02:24:17.450 --> 02:24:17.890]  Oh!
[02:24:21.570 --> 02:24:22.290]  That's taken.
[02:24:22.730 --> 02:24:23.610]  That's also taken.
[02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:25.230]  That was not.
[02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:28.470]  I'm kidding. This is a rough area.
[02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:30.730]  That's a real bad corner.
[02:24:30.730 --> 02:24:31.030]  That's a rough area.
[02:24:34.090 --> 02:24:35.670]  It's a rough trade through this corridor.
[02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:41.940]  Stockholm child kicker.
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:43.060]  Five gifted. Thank you.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.860]  You might get it, though.
[02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:50.260]  No, what I'll do is I'll knock two off
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.780]  and make it easier for Andrew to figure it out.
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:56.260]  That logic will never open it.
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:00.040]  You're about to make it. You're about to make progress.
[02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.930]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:10.090]  There's a star of both Gavin and Andrews in that cage.
[02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:13.190]  One of them's cold because of how little Andrew had it.
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:14.810]  Oh, Andrew's getting the red pipe.
[02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:16.730]  It's not me.
[02:25:17.430 --> 02:25:18.450]  I mean, Geoff.
[02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:21.330]  Oh, brother.
[02:25:21.430 --> 02:25:22.610]  Oh no, the red pipe!
[02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:23.390]  Yeah, that sucks.
[02:25:24.510 --> 02:25:27.210]  At least you can make the square more dangerous next turn.
[02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:29.390]  Five gifted. Mecha Waluigi, thank you.
[02:25:29.930 --> 02:25:30.950]  Thanks, Mecha Waluigi.
[02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:31.330]  Waluigi.
[02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:34.350]  I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[02:25:40.570 --> 02:25:42.390]  I gotta get out of here.
[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:43.850]  One space into Bowser.
[02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:49.590]  Yes!
[02:25:50.730 --> 02:25:52.390]  It's flying there now!
[02:25:53.430 --> 02:25:55.170]  The vault is looking tasty.
[02:25:56.730 --> 02:25:59.630]  I've been twatting around too long!
[02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:02.650]  I should've gone for the kill early!
[02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:03.810]  That was turbo twat.
[02:26:04.410 --> 02:26:06.350]  Oh, that's terrible luck.
[02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:08.130]  My turn.
[02:26:08.610 --> 02:26:09.170]  Wario.
[02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:12.750]  Definitely look at the board.
[02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:15.790]  Space. Peace.
[02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:18.250]  Hey man, are you him?
[02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:20.290]  What was that?
[02:26:20.430 --> 02:26:21.270]  There's cat pee in here.
[02:26:22.290 --> 02:26:25.330]  Do I have to... if I try placing this, do I have to?
[02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:26.490]  What?
[02:26:26.930 --> 02:26:27.810]  Yes, you do.
[02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:29.450]  If you use an item, you do have to use it.
[02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:31.110]  Oh, we learned that from your phone, didn't we?
[02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:32.490]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:33.350 --> 02:26:33.750]  One.
[02:26:34.210 --> 02:26:34.610]  Shit!
[02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.910]  Incredible.
[02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.930]  Alright, Donkey Kong.
[02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:47.110]  Oh yeah, definitely put it down.
[02:26:47.890 --> 02:26:51.470]  Oh, put it on the space right after.
[02:26:51.730 --> 02:26:52.010]  Or there.
[02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:54.690]  The space right after is brutal.
[02:26:54.690 --> 02:26:55.090]  Oh!
[02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:58.690]  Oh, that's such a...
[02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.850]  fucking awesome fuck you.
[02:27:01.290 --> 02:27:02.630]  Andrew, if you had to guess
[02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:04.530]  what the code was right now, just off the riff,
[02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:05.130]  what do you think it is?
[02:27:05.130 --> 02:27:07.870]  If I just had to guess...
[02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.610]  Uh...
[02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:11.250]  I think it's 27, right?
[02:27:12.330 --> 02:27:14.950]  98 is a good number for us, but the 8's already gone.
[02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:16.230]  Right, but 8's taken, yeah.
[02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:18.050]  Uh...
[02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:20.710]  I'm gonna go with 9.
[02:27:21.490 --> 02:27:21.890]  Uh-huh.
[02:27:21.890 --> 02:27:24.010]  Am I lucky number 5?
[02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:25.170]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:25.490 --> 02:27:26.230]  If this opens.
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:29.230]  Neither of them.
[02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.850]  Fuck.
[02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:33.190]  Down the pipe!
[02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.570]  See ya.
[02:27:35.810 --> 02:27:36.450]  Bloop bloop.
[02:27:38.310 --> 02:27:39.910]  I'll take some coins, please.
[02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:41.070]  Yep.
[02:27:42.730 --> 02:27:43.670]  Thank you.
[02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:46.130]  Brutal game so far.
[02:27:46.210 --> 02:27:47.290]  Yeah. Crazy game.
[02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:48.290]  What's in the menu?
[02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:49.310]  Absolute brute.
[02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:51.850]  I can see why people wanted us to do this for the month one.
[02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:55.150]  I just wouldn't have been able to keep anything straight.
[02:27:55.370 --> 02:27:55.630]  Yeah.
[02:27:56.930 --> 02:27:58.370]  It's hard playing just 30 turns
[02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:00.150]  regular style on this thing.
[02:28:00.250 --> 02:28:00.570]  Mm-hmm.
[02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:03.590]  This is gonna end up with us just passing
[02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:05.650]  the same star back and forth
[02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:07.490]  as we travel around the hell square.
[02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:09.970]  Ooh.
[02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:11.090]  Which way will he go?
[02:28:12.210 --> 02:28:13.170]  Yeah, that's the right decision.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:18.140]  What's a chomp call?
[02:28:18.140 --> 02:28:19.200]  The whistle.
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:20.980]  No, I'm good.
[02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:23.900]  You don't want to go through the gate?
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:24.720]  No, I'm good.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:26.700]  Fuck off.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:29.740]  What if the gate gives you a clue to the code?
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.520]  Oh, shit!
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:33.400]  The doors are gonna whisper to me?
[02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:34.420]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:37.320]  Here we go.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:38.780]  I'm staring you guys down.
[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:40.660]  Basketball.
[02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:40.780]  Oh.
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:48.060]  I don't know what this is, actually.
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:50.180]  Horizontal?
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:50.740]  Okay.
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:52.900]  Oh, this one.
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.800]  This one sucks.
[02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:56.620]  God damn it.
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:00.560]  This is where I'm not gonna get hit and then I missed a president at 30.
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:04.640]  Oh, that's right. Right at the end you gave him the win.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:06.100]  Mm-hmm.
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:06.200]  Ugh.
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:15.220]  This is very unresponsive right now.
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:16.020]  No!
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:18.000]  Oh, shit.
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:19.500]  You guys suck.
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:21.400]  Well, some of us do.
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.320]  The mole's doing great.
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:26.000]  It's just...
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  The mole sucks.
[02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:29.620]  Damn!
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:30.080]  Damn!
[02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:33.480]  90 seconds.
[02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:34.380]  90 seconds.
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:36.740]  Suck. Suck.
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:38.020]  No!
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.420]  Nick, I think you saved it from giving me...
[02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:41.840]  Damn it!
[02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:44.920]  It was well worth it.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:46.660]  I saved the day. You're welcome.
[02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:47.500]  Or thank you.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:51.300]  Damn it.
[02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:52.980]  Insane.
[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:54.580]  We did it.
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:55.880]  Did we?
[02:29:56.300 --> 02:29:57.060]  Yeah, we won.
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.220]  10, 20.
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:03.440]  Do we take a cake break?
[02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:05.160]  Or do we do it after 20?
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:05.700]  Oh.
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:09.120]  Yeah, what are you, dumb?
[02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:10.560]  Nick put his sweet tooth down.
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:13.640]  Then it leaves a straight 10.
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.680]  So you want to do it at 21?
[02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:16.580]  Yeah. Well, at the end of 20.
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:23.780]  Hey, why are you arguing with me? I'm right.
[02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:25.420]  Yeah, sure.
[02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:28.400]  I mean, if we started on number one, then he's right.
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:29.220]  He just starts agreeing.
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:29.980]  20 later.
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:31.860]  Oh, man.
[02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:36.300]  The one oasis is deadly.
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:39.420]  That's not a medal, it's a book.
[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:46.420]  There you go.
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:48.120]  Wow.
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:50.360]  Wait, did he take both of you?
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:51.020]  What?
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:51.560]  Oh, no.
[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:56.180]  It looked like he grabbed him.
[02:30:56.260 --> 02:30:57.640]  Oh, he's just going for it.
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:02.320]  You guys need to crack that code back there.
[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:04.580]  If I were Gavin, I'd take my headphones off
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.240]  and cry in the other room for 30 seconds.
[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:08.460]  But what would you do instead?
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:09.080]  Because you're not me.
[02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:10.980]  I'm just going to eat it like a man.
[02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:13.660]  We shouldn't have had cake.
[02:31:13.900 --> 02:31:14.700]  We shouldn't have eaten the cake.
[02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:23.020]  Yeah, what's your plan here, Nick?
[02:31:23.200 --> 02:31:24.460]  Just get out of here or what?
[02:31:27.020 --> 02:31:27.800]  Square lever.
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:28.860]  Yeah, I'm leaving the square.
[02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:30.920]  Go left.
[02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:34.440]  Oh, wow, Rosalina's left.
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:35.960]  Oh, there's a store, though.
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:36.860]  Oh, she is.
[02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:39.420]  There's a store and Rosalina.
[02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:44.920]  I think this is the last turn she's here, too.
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:46.340]  Nick postponing the cake.
[02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:48.820]  Oh, it's the good store.
[02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:50.560]  The star pipe.
[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:51.900]  Oh, the star pipe.
[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:54.420]  Oh, that'll cost me too much money.
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:56.080]  It might not.
[02:31:57.240 --> 02:31:59.380]  You don't have to use it next turn.
[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:03.960]  But Gavin is putting a hole in my pocket.
[02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:05.840]  This giant golden pipe.
[02:32:11.530 --> 02:32:12.090]  Alright.
[02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:14.870]  Oh, she gave me five coins.
[02:32:15.050 --> 02:32:16.190]  I have enough for the star.
[02:32:16.490 --> 02:32:18.070]  I'll take the pipe next turn.
[02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:19.750]  Maybe.
[02:32:20.430 --> 02:32:21.710]  Oh, another showdown.
[02:32:22.930 --> 02:32:25.110]  Get one cheap item at random.
[02:32:28.650 --> 02:32:31.210]  What is her thing again?
[02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:33.250]  Before hitting the pipe.
[02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:36.870]  Vertical.
[02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:39.090]  Uh-oh.
[02:32:40.090 --> 02:32:41.610]  Oh, shit.
[02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:42.070]  Oh, yeah.
[02:32:43.310 --> 02:32:45.290]  The snowbirds.
[02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:49.070]  Oh, yeah. Hell yeah.
[02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:52.910]  So, Nick gets a little boost, right?
[02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:53.330]  Yeah.
[02:32:53.850 --> 02:32:54.950]  A little prick boost.
[02:32:56.730 --> 02:32:57.130]  Alright.
[02:32:59.410 --> 02:33:01.550]  Goodbye, friends.
[02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:03.390]  I don't know why I jumped.
[02:33:04.130 --> 02:33:05.270]  You're going crazy mode.
[02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:12.290]  Wow, Nick is up there.
[02:33:12.730 --> 02:33:13.590]  He's got a big lead.
[02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:15.290]  You got that prick boost.
[02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:17.410]  I'm going for a Formula 1 sort of line.
[02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:18.190]  Oh!
[02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.770]  How's that working?
[02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:21.010]  Hit the wall.
[02:33:23.170 --> 02:33:24.930]  Wait, how do you get him to do the little...
[02:33:24.930 --> 02:33:26.570]  What the bullshit is that?
[02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:28.190]  How do you do the jump thing?
[02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:30.610]  How do you do the jump thing, Andrew? Tell me.
[02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.510]  Andrew!
[02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.910]  Ow.
[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:38.650]  Why won't you jump?
[02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:41.590]  I am sucking anus
[02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:42.210]  at the back here.
[02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:43.870]  Oh, I see. You're not very good.
[02:33:47.650 --> 02:33:49.410]  Monkey Kong up there is going nuts.
[02:33:49.570 --> 02:33:50.450]  Oh, I'm killing it.
[02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:56.390]  Watching Wario just suck anus
[02:33:56.390 --> 02:33:57.550]  back here is wild.
[02:33:57.610 --> 02:33:59.110]  I just saw the ball jump there.
[02:34:00.390 --> 02:34:01.610]  It made me laugh.
[02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:03.490]  There we go.
[02:34:03.570 --> 02:34:04.110]  I got it now.
[02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:06.590]  I don't even know why I showed up
[02:34:07.150 --> 02:34:08.230]  to some of these.
[02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:10.130]  Ow, balls.
[02:34:11.490 --> 02:34:13.650]  You're good, Andrew. You got nothing to worry about.
[02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:16.570]  He's got plenty to worry about.
[02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:19.110]  I'm right on his fucking donkey ass.
[02:34:19.350 --> 02:34:19.970]  That's right.
[02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:22.390]  Oh no, I'm just dodging guns.
[02:34:22.810 --> 02:34:24.130]  I'm dodging it!
[02:34:24.330 --> 02:34:25.030]  What? No!
[02:34:25.710 --> 02:34:27.990]  Alright, you're good, Andrew.
[02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:28.450]  Shit!
[02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:30.910]  Where?
[02:34:32.890 --> 02:34:33.470]  Fuck!
[02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:34.210]  Go!
[02:34:36.670 --> 02:34:37.390]  Come on!
[02:34:37.930 --> 02:34:38.490]  Fuck!
[02:34:39.890 --> 02:34:40.210]  No!
[02:34:43.860 --> 02:34:46.140]  You piece of fucking
[02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:47.660]  dumb fucking shit!
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:50.720]  Gavin is falling apart.
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:52.340]  How is this not over yet?
[02:34:52.420 --> 02:34:53.400]  Let it end!
[02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:54.580]  Just kill me!
[02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:57.220]  Straight is right, though.
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:34:58.140]  Go!
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:02.480]  Deal for the win!
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:04.460]  Ain't no one close to you.
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:05.100]  Stealing it!
[02:35:07.140 --> 02:35:08.500]  Dillionaires rise up.
[02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:09.380]  Another friend!
[02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.440]  I took a fucking screenshot.
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:14.880]  Whose switch is this?
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:15.640]  His.
[02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:16.200]  Mine.
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:21.740]  What if the game froze up because you took so many screenshots?
[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:23.320]  Took up all the space.
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:26.580]  Hey, you're gonna fuck the game.
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:30.000]  I don't care.
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.680]  I don't even know how to look at them.
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.140]  Doesn't mean they're not filling up your memory.
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:42.460]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:44.520]  We're gonna need to play Mario Party one day
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:45.060]  and I'm gonna go,
[02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:46.400]  my switch doesn't work
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:47.560]  and you go, I'll fix it.
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:48.420]  It won't even turn on.
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:49.280]  Oh, it's full.
[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:50.860]  It's out of space.
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:53.780]  Oh, piss my pants.
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:56.560]  Does the bunny give you two chances at the vault?
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:57.440]  It does.
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:58.100]  Sure does.
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.360]  Someone's guffed.
[02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:04.560]  Who absolutely dropped one?
[02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:06.140]  Andrew, is that you?
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:06.620]  Yep.
[02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:08.980]  Sure was.
[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:17.360]  Oh, hey, it's a star.
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:20.320]  I can't believe we get to do this every day.
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:25.500]  I can't afford boo if I do this.
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:28.280]  I can't afford boo.
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:31.560]  But nobody else can reach the star quickly.
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:32.300]  You know what?
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:34.240]  What?
[02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:34.560]  What?
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:35.880]  Yes!
[02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:39.220]  I love it!
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:39.900]  No thanks.
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:42.280]  No thanks.
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:45.200]  Is it not letting you?
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:46.620]  I've never seen this before.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.600]  I do have something else in mind.
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:50.620]  Prick.
[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.780]  We're not accepting offers right now.
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:54.960]  There's a different star I want.
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:55.540]  From who?
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:36:56.900]  From Nick.
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:00.420]  Okay, I'm gonna hit random.
[02:37:00.420 --> 02:37:00.860]  Okay.
[02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:03.720]  Oh, can you believe it?
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:07.320]  Wow.
[02:37:08.460 --> 02:37:09.420]  Nick will remember that.
[02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:12.300]  Nah, I was already remembering
[02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:14.280]  all the other shit that you'd done.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:16.220]  It's like a telltale game.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.740]  Nick will remember this choice.
[02:37:18.100 --> 02:37:19.940]  Wow, you really had to not want that star.
[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:22.240]  They gave you four chances to say oops.
[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:26.180]  Back to the start.
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:27.840]  Off we go.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:29.100]  Low battery.
[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:32.040]  Well, I guess we'll charge him while we go eat cake.
[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:33.420]  Who's player three?
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:33.860]  That's me.
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:37.120]  I got another one over there.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:39.580]  Did I get idiot flag for the star?
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:41.400]  There were people, but
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:43.140]  the play was fine.
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:46.320]  Crucified Donkey, five gifted.
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:47.640]  Thanks, Crucified Donkey.
[02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:48.780]  Doggy?
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:51.200]  Interesting.
[02:37:56.850 --> 02:37:58.150]  Should've used an item before you did this turn.
[02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:02.390]  Didn't think that far ahead.
[02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:04.430]  That's alright.
[02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.950]  Can afford the star now.
[02:38:06.690 --> 02:38:08.370]  Weren't we supposed to be eating cake already?
[02:38:08.770 --> 02:38:10.350]  Nick said not until turn 21.
[02:38:10.650 --> 02:38:13.970]  It makes sense. We finished 20 and that way there's 10 turns left.
[02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:16.330]  She gave you some trash.
[02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:18.670]  Can I... no.
[02:38:19.890 --> 02:38:21.570]  Let me throw one down
[02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:22.550]  and then you can give me one.
[02:38:23.310 --> 02:38:25.370]  She didn't seem offended that you did that right in front of her.
[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:27.330]  It was magic, it's fine.
[02:38:28.310 --> 02:38:29.510]  She'll conjure up another one.
[02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:31.170]  Oh, it's magic.
[02:38:31.810 --> 02:38:32.250]  You know.
[02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:35.790]  You're really just trapping those lucky spots.
[02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:38.510]  People keep landing on them.
[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:40.910]  There's good luck and there's bad luck.
[02:38:41.290 --> 02:38:42.090]  Oh wow.
[02:38:43.090 --> 02:38:43.790]  Double down.
[02:38:43.930 --> 02:38:44.470]  Oh boy.
[02:38:47.650 --> 02:38:47.970]  Oh.
[02:38:48.850 --> 02:38:49.950]  Oh no.
[02:38:50.930 --> 02:38:51.830]  The hell zone.
[02:38:53.890 --> 02:38:54.430]  Oh.
[02:38:55.350 --> 02:38:56.770]  I think I spin it back the other way.
[02:38:56.770 --> 02:38:57.090]  Oh.
[02:38:58.450 --> 02:38:59.770]  Oh, how nice of her.
[02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:01.030]  Wow.
[02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:05.010]  No, no, no.
[02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:06.510]  It's gonna be double.
[02:39:07.290 --> 02:39:08.230]  Double, double.
[02:39:08.490 --> 02:39:10.170]  She's gonna punk you in front of your new friend.
[02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.830]  No.
[02:39:16.130 --> 02:39:17.430]  That is rough.
[02:39:17.550 --> 02:39:19.190]  Oh man.
[02:39:19.430 --> 02:39:20.550]  So then they'll do that again.
[02:39:22.090 --> 02:39:22.610]  Oh.
[02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:25.550]  What if he just takes the star this time?
[02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:26.330]  Without even thinking.
[02:39:27.550 --> 02:39:28.390]  That would...
[02:39:30.510 --> 02:39:31.850]  That would be a real
[02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:33.470]  full slap into fourth place.
[02:39:37.310 --> 02:39:37.790]  No.
[02:39:38.610 --> 02:39:40.330]  Why did you predict that?
[02:39:41.010 --> 02:39:42.590]  I was trying to jinx it for you.
[02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:44.290]  Why did I win that mini game?
[02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:45.090]  Wow.
[02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:48.790]  I should have just lost the mini game.
[02:39:49.170 --> 02:39:50.230]  Has anything good ever happened
[02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:52.110]  with you and a partner in this game?
[02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:54.370]  It's hell on this map.
[02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:56.170]  This is insane.
[02:39:56.510 --> 02:39:57.610]  It's double suck.
[02:39:59.090 --> 02:40:00.050]  Mini game.
[02:40:02.310 --> 02:40:02.710]  All right.
[02:40:02.910 --> 02:40:03.310]  Then cake.
[02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:06.770]  Dill stalks at an all-time low.
[02:40:08.730 --> 02:40:09.730]  Some shadow play.
[02:40:10.350 --> 02:40:11.270]  Let's do this, Nick.
[02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:13.410]  Oh, I'm gonna do bad at this.
[02:40:13.630 --> 02:40:14.210]  What's shadow play?
[02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:15.310]  Oh, F10.
[02:40:16.390 --> 02:40:17.250]  Oh, what?
[02:40:17.350 --> 02:40:18.970]  I've never played this one.
[02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:22.230]  Bones.
[02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:24.050]  So what, have I got the top bit?
[02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:26.810]  I know why it was right.
[02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:28.170]  Oh, we have to overlap it.
[02:40:29.130 --> 02:40:31.130]  No, I wasn't...
[02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:31.450]  Oh, we got it.
[02:40:31.970 --> 02:40:34.490]  Okay, we got it.
[02:40:34.970 --> 02:40:37.310]  Oh, that's a...
[02:40:37.890 --> 02:40:38.410]  What the fuck is it?
[02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:39.750]  Oh.
[02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:41.530]  Oops!
[02:40:42.350 --> 02:40:43.390]  What are you doing?
[02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:44.930]  Let me get this one in.
[02:40:45.310 --> 02:40:46.230]  Nope, I'm the bottom.
[02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:48.030]  Nope, that's not it.
[02:40:49.150 --> 02:40:50.350]  What are you doing?
[02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:52.090]  What are you doing?
[02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:53.950]  What are you doing?
[02:40:54.810 --> 02:40:56.190]  What are you doing?
[02:40:56.390 --> 02:40:56.530]  What?
[02:40:59.310 --> 02:41:01.670]  You can see what you can select at the bottom.
[02:41:03.630 --> 02:41:04.730]  What the fuck did you say?
[02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:08.270]  Yes!
[02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:11.230]  Alright, now I know what I'm doing.
[02:41:11.430 --> 02:41:12.350]  You didn't know until then?
[02:41:12.690 --> 02:41:14.630]  I'm having a fucking stroke.
[02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:21.810]  I was bad on the last two.
[02:41:22.890 --> 02:41:24.610]  Boys, I'm really losing it today.
[02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:25.370]  That was bad.
[02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:26.770]  I need the cake. I need the sugar.
[02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:29.150]  Well, let's see what Bowser does and let them eat cake.
[02:41:30.250 --> 02:41:32.510]  Alright, let's see what Bowser's gonna fuck us with.
[02:41:33.490 --> 02:41:33.990]  Oh, hey.
[02:41:35.830 --> 02:41:36.310]  Okay.
[02:41:36.610 --> 02:41:39.490]  It's a lot closer of a game than it was one turn ago.
[02:41:42.210 --> 02:41:43.510]  AKA turn 20.
[02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:49.820]  Oh.
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:50.760]  Huh.
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:54.360]  Well...
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:55.040]  Jesus!
[02:41:56.580 --> 02:41:57.920]  What the fuck?
[02:41:58.100 --> 02:41:58.860]  That's real rough.
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:00.900]  He doesn't eat the Star Steals, does he?
[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:02.660]  Alright, boys. Let's eat some cake.
[02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:05.820]  Hang on, Andrew. I'll jump on so you can hear us.
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:08.280]  And I'll turn on the other cam.
[02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:12.520]  Oh, hey. Gavin, will you bring him?
[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:13.620]  Are we kicking in a hit?
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.220]  No, let's go out there.
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:17.060]  Bring the camera and bring the robot.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:19.700]  Alright.
[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:20.580]  Robot's on the move.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:21.960]  Go to cake time.
[02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:24.660]  Yeah, yeah. It's cake time. We hear you.
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:27.880]  Okay, here he comes. Me and Andrew coming.
[02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:29.140]  Here he comes.
[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:30.960]  Go a little left. There you go. A little right.
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:32.160]  Go to the right.
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:33.360]  The camera?
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.020]  You're doing great.
[02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:36.840]  This is a tough one.
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:38.280]  You're doing great.
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.600]  There you go.
[02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:44.540]  You did a trick.
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:46.600]  Gotta go right.
[02:42:51.920 --> 02:42:53.060]  Let's get some cake.
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:54.380]  Let's go get that cake.
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:55.500]  Okay.
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:42:58.420]  Spin around.
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:02.800]  This is kind of how my dog does it.
[02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:03.320]  Here we go.
[02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:05.740]  Hey, are you in the kitchen? I'm in the kitchen too.
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:06.160]  Yeah, me too.
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:08.120]  He's cutting the cake.
[02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:09.840]  Well, boys.
[02:43:11.100 --> 02:43:12.280]  It's been a pretty good year.
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:13.780]  You want to show our cake off?
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:17.080]  Yeah. Happy birthday, Eric, plus us.
[02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:18.080]  Eric and Erectus.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:20.660]  Happy birthday, Erectus.
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.220]  There it is.
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.840]  Long time coming to be able to get a space like this.
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:28.400]  This is really awesome.
[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:30.580]  I'm really happy to be here
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:31.760]  and doing this stuff with you guys.
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:32.800]  Hell yeah.
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:35.680]  Even Andrew, who's a little robot.
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:38.160]  Can you pick me up so I can see the cake?
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:39.860]  Oh, yeah. Can you pick him up so he can see the cake?
[02:43:39.940 --> 02:43:40.800]  He wants to see Erectus.
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.320]  That's a nice cake right there.
[02:43:48.420 --> 02:43:48.700]  You're doing ice cream.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:51.360]  Yeah, that's it, man. How do you feel?
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:52.860]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:55.400]  Good slice here.
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:57.080]  Which part do you want, Andrew?
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:01.430]  I think I'll have the second piece.
[02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:03.640]  Oh, you want the second piece?
[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:05.440]  I want the balloons in the top left.
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:06.820]  Oh, okay.
[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:08.360]  Okay, sounds good.
[02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:12.600]  I see you.
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:21.120]  Cake and ice cream in two stations.
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:22.000]  This is pretty good.
[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:24.780]  Guys, thanks for joining us
[02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:26.480]  on our cake and ice cream adventure.
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:29.040]  One year of doing this podcast.
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:30.020]  Happy Mother's Day.
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:31.200]  Happy Mother's Day also.
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:33.600]  And all the anniversaries.
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:36.500]  Happy Mother's Day to all the MILFs out there
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:37.020]  from Nick.
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:39.820]  If he was here and you were here,
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:41.120]  you'd worship your feet.
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:43.560]  That's Nick howling for MILFs.
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:45.720]  Every full moon he howls
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.820]  from the top of a hill for a bunch of MILFs.
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:49.340]  MILF howl.
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:51.820]  Oh, you just served yourself.
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.160]  Oh, I see. I thought you were going to
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:54.100]  dull out a bunch of cake.
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:55.260]  That's some bullshit.
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:56.780]  I had to make sure it's not poison.
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:44:59.500]  Now, does everybody want a piece?
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:00.540]  Yes.
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:05.240]  Okay, Gavin, you're boring, so you'll get this one.
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:06.320]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:07.920]  You're not going to eat. You'll be like,
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:10.080]  I don't like frosting because it's flavorful.
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:11.680]  Is that what you say?
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:12.340]  I don't like cake.
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:14.940]  My wife's the same way.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:17.000]  We have so many similarities.
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:17.800]  It's very true.
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:21.000]  It's fucked up how you and my wife are similar,
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:22.140]  how me and Meg are similar.
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:24.840]  It's not good. I don't like it.
[02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:26.220]  It's not good.
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:27.660]  Why not?
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.320]  Alright, MILFs over there, why don't you calm down.
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:31.680]  Does everybody want ice cream with their cake too?
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:32.300]  Absolutely.
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:33.400]  This is cake cam.
[02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:37.760]  Do that again.
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:41.700]  You kissed him.
[02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:44.020]  I didn't kiss him.
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:44.980]  Did Andrew look at you?
[02:45:44.980 --> 02:45:47.000]  You know what we should do with Andrew when he's naughty?
[02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:48.060]  Here.
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:52.940]  Andrew, have you been bad?
[02:45:53.140 --> 02:45:53.300]  What?
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:55.580]  No, no, no!
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:45:57.140]  Actually, this feels like home.
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:45:59.360]  You put me in my natural environment.
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:03.220]  He made some ice.
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:05.520]  Get out of here!
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:05.640]  Get out of here!
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:11.160]  Can we put one of the mics in there?
[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:16.940]  Put the mic in there so we can hear him rummaging around.
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:23.460]  I love the idea of having a little robot in the fridge
[02:46:23.460 --> 02:46:24.660]  every time you open it, it's like, no.
[02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:26.720]  I saw you.
[02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:28.680]  It probably voids the warranty.
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:31.120]  Andrew, try and escape.
[02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:32.420]  I'm trying!
[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:36.640]  Is it dark and cold?
[02:46:36.780 --> 02:46:38.060]  It's so cold in here!
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:39.660]  Now put the camera in there.
[02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:42.120]  This is you, Eric.
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:42.860]  Thank you.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:45.780]  He's out!
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.500]  He's cold and scared.
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:54.320]  Happy birthday, guys.
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:56.180]  Happy birthday!
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.700]  Oh, man.
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:04.200]  You don't like cake?
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:05.820]  He's got to eat it.
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:07.800]  Is it the cake or the frosting that's offensive?
[02:47:09.340 --> 02:47:10.400]  The sugar, I guess?
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.840]  We're American, we love this shit.
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:18.260]  My body would probably shut down if I couldn't have it.
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:20.400]  Andrew's just exploring.
[02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:22.220]  I'm trying to fuck up this Mario Party game
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:23.060]  while you guys are away.
[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:25.260]  Did he go back in?
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:29.980]  He said, ooh!
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:31.240]  Stop him!
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:32.840]  He's sabotaging!
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:35.340]  Oh, I'm stuck on the rug! You guys have knotted up the rug!
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.460]  Created a bunch of dunes.
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:40.600]  Rug dunes.
[02:47:44.450 --> 02:47:45.530]  What else can I do?
[02:47:46.050 --> 02:47:47.410]  You know what makes no sense,
[02:47:47.430 --> 02:47:48.450]  if you don't understand us?
[02:47:49.090 --> 02:47:49.570]  This.
[02:47:50.890 --> 02:47:53.010]  Just the weird mannequins
[02:47:54.370 --> 02:47:55.630]  of rumbly suits.
[02:48:03.290 --> 02:48:04.990]  We're just silently eating cake.
[02:48:05.310 --> 02:48:05.710]  Hanging out.
[02:48:05.710 --> 02:48:06.730]  Nice little cake break.
[02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:09.410]  We're at turn 20 of 30 in Mario Party.
[02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:11.070]  66% of the way there.
[02:48:12.890 --> 02:48:13.950]  Headed into the final week.
[02:48:14.170 --> 02:48:16.210]  I've got to try one of these crazy sodies.
[02:48:16.690 --> 02:48:17.310]  What are they, water?
[02:48:17.470 --> 02:48:18.110]  What is it, 7-Up?
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:30.520]  Now I know where the piss came from.
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:32.600]  I need help!
[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:36.180]  Come on, Gavin, let's go help him.
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.380]  Rub it down!
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:42.760]  I am so excited to have Andrew
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:44.580]  just rummaging around the place.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:44.840]  Right?
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:47.940]  Thank you. How's it going, fellas?
[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:49.560]  You're going to think you're alone,
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:51.200]  fucking editing one day.
[02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:54.760]  Dude, I was alone setting up the stream, and I heard him howl at me.
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:55.960]  He's spinning his wheels.
[02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:04.630]  Why is it making that noise?
[02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:05.570]  He's purring.
[02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:07.650]  This guy's a freak.
[02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:08.370]  You happy, bud?
[02:49:09.490 --> 02:49:10.290]  What a freak.
[02:49:15.070 --> 02:49:18.990]  You guys ready for the last third of Mario Party?
[02:49:19.290 --> 02:49:20.830]  I'm getting a second donut first.
[02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:24.510]  I'm going to take a piss.
[02:49:26.130 --> 02:49:27.930]  Be sure to catch that.
[02:49:28.930 --> 02:49:29.850]  You're muted.
[02:49:31.230 --> 02:49:32.010]  We'll see.
[02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:34.390]  Hold on.
[02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:39.150]  Is Geoff pissing?
[02:49:39.650 --> 02:49:40.690]  Geoff be pissing.
[02:49:42.310 --> 02:49:43.050]  Alright, he's muted.
[02:49:43.390 --> 02:49:44.070]  That's what you think.
[02:49:44.850 --> 02:49:47.270]  I've muted him on two different channels this time.
[02:49:48.390 --> 02:49:49.970]  Alright, say something in chat now
[02:49:49.970 --> 02:49:50.970]  to be seen on the stream.
[02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:02.320]  I'm going in.
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:02.540]  I'm going in, shit.
[02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:04.920]  Oh, god.
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:06.700]  Come on.
[02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:09.700]  You're doing great, Andrew.
[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:10.760]  Working on it.
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:16.720]  I'm breakdancing.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:17.320]  Oh my god.
[02:50:22.050 --> 02:50:23.170]  It's a fucking rug.
[02:50:24.570 --> 02:50:25.450]  I had to stop peeing,
[02:50:25.490 --> 02:50:26.090]  or I was going to shit.
[02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:29.070]  Well, nobody heard that,
[02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:29.670]  so excellent.
[02:50:31.170 --> 02:50:31.910]  Alright, you're back.
[02:50:32.110 --> 02:50:33.770]  I couldn't risk that the audience would hear me go
[02:50:35.290 --> 02:50:36.010]  diarrhea-ed.
[02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:39.270]  State chocolate ice cream.
[02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:43.430]  I'm so excited to get back to the Mario party.
[02:50:43.570 --> 02:50:43.950]  Me too.
[02:50:44.330 --> 02:50:46.250]  I keep being like, where is my phone?
[02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:48.030]  Put me next to the donuts.
[02:50:48.270 --> 02:50:49.230]  It's about to die, I think.
[02:50:49.310 --> 02:50:49.710]  I want a donut.
[02:50:52.390 --> 02:50:53.450]  Somebody grab me a donut.
[02:50:54.610 --> 02:50:55.390]  Andrew wants a donut?
[02:50:55.390 --> 02:50:56.490]  What kind?
[02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:58.670]  We got strawberry sprinkles.
[02:50:59.030 --> 02:51:00.910]  He wants regular glazed.
[02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:03.170]  How's the chocolate?
[02:51:04.290 --> 02:51:05.270]  Where's the roof to this?
[02:51:06.130 --> 02:51:06.830]  The roof?
[02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:08.090]  Oh, the lid?
[02:51:08.370 --> 02:51:08.870]  To the ice cream?
[02:51:09.610 --> 02:51:11.050]  Put it on the donut.
[02:51:12.090 --> 02:51:12.850]  Oh, it's right there.
[02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:15.890]  It's sitting straight up and down.
[02:51:18.350 --> 02:51:19.570]  How'd I get ice cream on me?
[02:51:19.890 --> 02:51:20.450]  That's pretty good.
[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:22.750]  Is that the eating sound?
[02:51:24.850 --> 02:51:25.950]  You having your kibble?
[02:51:27.270 --> 02:51:29.350]  What if we put M&M's in that to distribute?
[02:51:30.530 --> 02:51:31.410]  Oh no!
[02:51:31.770 --> 02:51:32.010]  Oh!
[02:51:33.570 --> 02:51:34.570]  That's how we get ants.
[02:51:36.090 --> 02:51:37.450]  I'm trying to eat it.
[02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:38.330]  You can't get in the kitchen.
[02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.930]  Can you get up here?
[02:51:41.350 --> 02:51:42.910]  You just gotta get the angle right.
[02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:45.550]  Wow, he skyrimmed your way up.
[02:51:46.810 --> 02:51:46.990]  Whoa!
[02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:50.490]  Get me.
[02:51:52.950 --> 02:51:53.810]  Can't catch me.
[02:51:54.330 --> 02:51:55.250]  Oh shit!
[02:51:56.130 --> 02:51:57.470]  Ran into a wall.
[02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:00.950]  Thanks for the donut!
[02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:02.130]  Real Frank Abagnale.
[02:52:10.650 --> 02:52:11.110]  Alright.
[02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:13.330]  Let's do some Mario Party back going.
[02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:16.410]  Remember when we found the clothes of the murdered person in the closet earlier?
[02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:18.210]  Yes I do.
[02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:19.210]  She's probably buried in the yard.
[02:52:22.310 --> 02:52:23.290]  It's a floor donut.
[02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:26.450]  I wanna try this Zero Sugar Tropical.
[02:52:26.590 --> 02:52:27.050]  It's pretty good.
[02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:29.190]  Of course I'm full of sugar.
[02:52:30.750 --> 02:52:33.750]  It's gonna be a very hyper last third of the Mario Party.
[02:52:34.810 --> 02:52:35.790]  It's really good right?
[02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:37.850]  No sugar in that though.
[02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:39.750]  Zero sugar.
[02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:43.070]  Alright boys, let's do it.
[02:52:43.450 --> 02:52:44.630]  Andrew, we're diving back in.
[02:52:44.630 --> 02:52:45.110]  I'm ready.
[02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:45.870]  I'm ready.
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:55.840]  It's a little bit warmer in this room.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.740]  Alright, I'm gonna push the camera back.
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:02.320]  Did you charge your controller?
[02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:02.640]  Yep.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.540]  Alright Andrew, you ready?
[02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:24.040]  I'm ready.
[02:53:25.480 --> 02:53:27.160]  Getting reconnected here on this end.
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:28.240]  And then it's time.
[02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:32.800]  Pretty successful break I thought.
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:34.060]  Great cake.
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:36.240]  Good call on the cake fellas.
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:37.620]  Good cake call.
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:41.580]  Alright, we're all connected, let's do it.
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.160]  Roll them dice.
[02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:48.800]  Thanks for spending your Sunday with us.
[02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:50.060]  It's good right?
[02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:51.780]  You're on Mother's Day Sunday.
[02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:52.800]  That's right.
[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:54.820]  Happy Mother's Day baby.
[02:53:55.420 --> 02:53:56.140]  Not your mom.
[02:53:57.980 --> 02:53:59.040]  What'd you say okay for?
[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:01.360]  Yelling happy Mother's Day.
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:04.440]  I mean you know, sometimes you just gotta...
[02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:05.220]  Steer into the skin.
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:08.600]  Look at that corner up there.
[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:09.420]  Oh my god.
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:15.520]  I'm just going straight for the vault.
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:16.260]  Hell yeah.
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:28.500]  I wonder if my wife is tuned into this at all.
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:30.580]  Not my friend again.
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.960]  I'm out of this buying stuffed animals
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:36.660]  with gallons of life.
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:43.540]  Hello friend.
[02:54:48.470 --> 02:54:49.490]  Oh, sorry.
[02:54:50.030 --> 02:54:50.370]  Thank you.
[02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:54.110]  Well.
[02:54:54.910 --> 02:54:55.970]  Alright, it's Mario time.
[02:54:56.730 --> 02:54:57.250]  Alright.
[02:54:59.610 --> 02:55:01.250]  Four plus... what the hell is that?
[02:55:01.650 --> 02:55:03.290]  I think it means if you have the key, you can...
[02:55:03.290 --> 02:55:04.250]  Oh, the key.
[02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:08.630]  Got it.
[02:55:08.890 --> 02:55:09.630]  So you just gotta...
[02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:11.530]  Can Geoff go this way?
[02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:13.850]  No, I can't.
[02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.830]  Yes he can.
[02:55:17.770 --> 02:55:17.790]  Alright.
[02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:20.330]  God, shut up Wario.
[02:55:20.610 --> 02:55:21.570]  Die Wario.
[02:55:21.790 --> 02:55:22.970]  This is a voter star.
[02:55:22.970 --> 02:55:23.390]  Whee!
[02:55:24.350 --> 02:55:25.230]  Might be the one.
[02:55:26.330 --> 02:55:27.890]  You just went into lava.
[02:55:29.250 --> 02:55:30.050]  It burns.
[02:55:31.990 --> 02:55:33.630]  Straight in front of Boo as well.
[02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:35.150]  Don't roll a one, fool.
[02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:36.810]  He's not going to have enough.
[02:55:37.530 --> 02:55:39.010]  Maybe he can say no four times.
[02:55:42.350 --> 02:55:45.090]  I don't have enough to use Boo to my advantage in that sense.
[02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:46.890]  But I do have enough to buy this one.
[02:55:48.130 --> 02:55:48.510]  You do.
[02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:50.370]  Can't you steal coins for free?
[02:55:50.370 --> 02:55:50.750]  Yeah!
[02:55:51.350 --> 02:55:53.390]  Geoff is going to try to steal that star.
[02:55:57.610 --> 02:55:58.830]  Oh my god.
[02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:02.290]  I'm going to mute this part of the stream.
[02:56:06.850 --> 02:56:07.830]  Where's the star going to be?
[02:56:08.010 --> 02:56:08.410]  Right there.
[02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:16.650]  Oh hey, old friend!
[02:56:17.490 --> 02:56:18.730]  Hey, who are you going to steal coins from?
[02:56:18.730 --> 02:56:19.490]  You know what?
[02:56:20.970 --> 02:56:21.290]  Fate.
[02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:22.510]  You're crazy.
[02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.270]  Wow!
[02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:27.470]  That wasn't personal.
[02:56:31.810 --> 02:56:32.890]  Fight him with your two.
[02:56:33.650 --> 02:56:35.170]  I'm going to mash as well, just for helping.
[02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:37.610]  Solidarity mash.
[02:56:37.950 --> 02:56:38.610]  Nah, it's not too bad.
[02:56:40.130 --> 02:56:40.750]  It is what it is.
[02:56:41.650 --> 02:56:42.790]  Should be a recipe in the cookbook.
[02:56:45.990 --> 02:56:47.570]  Back to the front.
[02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:49.490]  Oh hey, Mario.
[02:56:49.770 --> 02:56:50.070]  Hey!
[02:56:50.370 --> 02:56:50.670]  What's up?
[02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.610]  Where are you?
[02:56:56.450 --> 02:56:57.050]  Alright.
[02:57:02.450 --> 02:57:03.650]  Oh boy.
[02:57:05.050 --> 02:57:06.150]  Decisions, decisions.
[02:57:06.330 --> 02:57:07.410]  Let's get in on this.
[02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:10.630]  I think we've got enough players in that game.
[02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:12.550]  No, there's never enough.
[02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:18.650]  Oh, look at this, Gavin!
[02:57:18.930 --> 02:57:19.730]  Look at it!
[02:57:20.270 --> 02:57:20.970]  Look at this!
[02:57:22.850 --> 02:57:23.570]  Alright, which way?
[02:57:24.450 --> 02:57:25.250]  23, 29.
[02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:26.610]  Oh, what's it going to be?
[02:57:28.210 --> 02:57:28.590]  Oh.
[02:57:34.210 --> 02:57:34.910]  Big boy.
[02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:39.470]  What are you going to get rid of, though?
[02:57:42.270 --> 02:57:42.670]  Interesting.
[02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:45.310]  I feel like that thing has never worked in my career.
[02:57:45.430 --> 02:57:47.630]  Yeah, but it's good at getting the goddamn out of there.
[02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:49.610]  Yeah, it took right across the street.
[02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:52.670]  It's a danger, though.
[02:57:52.990 --> 02:57:54.090]  Oh, what are you doing?
[02:57:54.450 --> 02:57:54.750]  Alright.
[02:58:02.940 --> 02:58:04.500]  I can't believe you didn't put an item down.
[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:05.640]  I don't want to put it down there.
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:06.920]  Why?
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:11.840]  He'd rather get an opportunity for another item.
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:12.980]  I want to put it up here.
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:13.720]  Oh, shit.
[02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:17.620]  Up here, eh?
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:18.320]  Oh, man.
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:20.320]  Let's see if he, uh...
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:22.580]  Oh, he lets you.
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:22.880]  Punch!
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:23.880]  Oh!
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:27.680]  Oh, that's rough.
[02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:30.320]  That might have been the best thing that could have happened.
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:32.740]  I mean, if you lost 10, it probably would have been better.
[02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:33.640]  Yeah, 10 would have been better.
[02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:35.620]  That's true. Thanks, Nick.
[02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:38.400]  Bowser Revolution would have been better, too, probably.
[02:58:39.260 --> 02:58:41.920]  You said, like, a kind of untrue statement, so I thought you'd clarify.
[02:58:42.140 --> 02:58:43.400]  Yeah, I was just trying to make myself feel better.
[02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:44.580]  Oh.
[02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:45.540]  Did it work?
[02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:46.060]  Nope.
[02:58:46.920 --> 02:58:47.740]  Did I help?
[02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:48.920]  Nope.
[02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:52.020]  Where did it go wrong, do you think?
[02:58:53.480 --> 02:58:54.780]  Do you think you'll try again later?
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:56.400]  Yeah, I'll give it another go.
[02:59:03.310 --> 02:59:03.910]  Punch it.
[02:59:04.030 --> 02:59:04.470]  Fuck!
[02:59:07.790 --> 02:59:08.670]  Oh, wow.
[02:59:08.810 --> 02:59:09.630]  Oh, no.
[02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:13.890]  I have to go back through all those spaces!
[02:59:14.870 --> 02:59:15.550]  Yes, you do.
[02:59:15.550 --> 02:59:15.670]  There you go.
[02:59:16.810 --> 02:59:17.930]  In the bomb!
[02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:20.170]  In the bomb!
[02:59:21.690 --> 02:59:22.210]  Oh!
[02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:24.470]  That's funny.
[02:59:25.550 --> 02:59:27.690]  That was a good cake.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:29.170]  Yeah, it wasn't bad, right?
[02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:30.670]  Team up.
[02:59:30.790 --> 02:59:33.030]  No slouch, right?
[02:59:33.490 --> 02:59:34.450]  A little tag-team action.
[02:59:37.150 --> 02:59:38.570]  It's all about the money.
[02:59:38.670 --> 02:59:40.370]  Let's get that bunch of coins.
[02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:43.370]  Money, money, money.
[02:59:43.370 --> 02:59:43.530]  Money.
[02:59:44.830 --> 02:59:46.630]  I get nervous whenever it goes vertical.
[02:59:47.490 --> 02:59:48.090]  Where's my strap?
[02:59:49.170 --> 02:59:49.650]  Oh!
[02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:52.310]  Oh, a little bit of this.
[02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:54.530]  Oh, that's bad.
[02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.850]  Okay.
[02:59:58.430 --> 02:59:58.910]  Okay.
[03:00:00.450 --> 03:00:00.930]  Okay.
[03:00:01.350 --> 03:00:02.370]  You guys got it.
[03:00:03.310 --> 03:00:04.650]  Just waiting on this twirl.
[03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:06.770]  Twirl and toss, twirl and toss.
[03:00:07.070 --> 03:00:08.370]  Oh, you have to pull a few times.
[03:00:09.370 --> 03:00:10.110]  Is that true?
[03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:11.530]  I'm the big ones.
[03:00:11.570 --> 03:00:12.130]  Oh, shit.
[03:00:12.690 --> 03:00:15.510]  There's a lot of unfortunate happening here, isn't there?
[03:00:15.630 --> 03:00:16.510]  Give me that big one!
[03:00:17.370 --> 03:00:18.790]  I'm so delayed!
[03:00:19.870 --> 03:00:21.870]  You guys gotta throw it if you want it.
[03:00:22.030 --> 03:00:23.470]  Go faster, Dan!
[03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:23.830]  Pull it!
[03:00:24.870 --> 03:00:26.270]  Son of a bitch!
[03:00:27.270 --> 03:00:29.270]  Throw the fucking thing!
[03:00:29.730 --> 03:00:30.110]  Go!
[03:00:32.430 --> 03:00:33.670]  Mario has not...
[03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:34.210]  Oh, pull, pull!
[03:00:35.810 --> 03:00:37.210]  You guys suck.
[03:00:38.310 --> 03:00:39.430]  Good job, Geoff!
[03:00:39.710 --> 03:00:40.590]  Nice, Geoff!
[03:00:41.270 --> 03:00:41.830]  God!
[03:00:42.050 --> 03:00:42.230]  Fuck!
[03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:46.110]  Yeah!
[03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:48.130]  Come on!
[03:00:48.290 --> 03:00:50.070]  Throw it!
[03:00:51.450 --> 03:00:52.770]  Alright, we got one, Gavin!
[03:00:53.070 --> 03:00:53.790]  Come on, Bob!
[03:00:54.090 --> 03:00:55.870]  Come on!
[03:00:57.130 --> 03:00:58.310]  Give me that shit!
[03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:59.430]  Gavin, help me!
[03:00:59.490 --> 03:01:01.790]  Come on!
[03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:04.290]  You idiot! I don't want it!
[03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:06.810]  Gavin, help me with this one!
[03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:07.130]  Okay.
[03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:09.230]  Fuck!
[03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:10.550]  Come on, Geoff!
[03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:13.130]  No way!
[03:01:14.430 --> 03:01:15.830]  It's gonna end in a tie!
[03:01:17.110 --> 03:01:19.010]  All of that for nothing!
[03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:21.110]  All of that for nothing.
[03:01:21.450 --> 03:01:23.350]  I did not like how that controlled.
[03:01:23.690 --> 03:01:24.950]  That was rough.
[03:01:25.570 --> 03:01:27.590]  Could you even get one with a big one on your end?
[03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:28.430]  Is it impossible?
[03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:31.070]  No, I don't think so. Also, I have wankers cramp now.
[03:01:32.950 --> 03:01:34.630]  He reactivated his wanking.
[03:01:36.270 --> 03:01:37.550]  It's not tennis elbows.
[03:01:38.090 --> 03:01:39.170]  Wankers cramp.
[03:01:42.810 --> 03:01:44.350]  What a turn.
[03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:45.210]  What a turn.
[03:01:48.310 --> 03:01:48.950]  Hello.
[03:01:49.350 --> 03:01:50.310]  See you later.
[03:01:51.570 --> 03:01:52.090]  She's not leaving?
[03:01:54.470 --> 03:01:54.630]  Oh.
[03:01:55.850 --> 03:01:58.230]  Oh, you got an achievement.
[03:01:58.250 --> 03:01:58.750]  Nice achievement.
[03:01:58.750 --> 03:01:59.350]  Oh.
[03:02:03.570 --> 03:02:04.070]  Uh...
[03:02:04.070 --> 03:02:04.850]  Let's look at the board.
[03:02:06.970 --> 03:02:09.090]  Star's right there. Who's closest to the star?
[03:02:09.210 --> 03:02:10.670]  You guys were so bad at that.
[03:02:10.910 --> 03:02:11.310]  What do you mean?
[03:02:11.670 --> 03:02:14.110]  What do you mean?
[03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:16.110]  What were you watching?
[03:02:16.350 --> 03:02:19.490]  It felt horrible to control.
[03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:20.010]  It hurt.
[03:02:21.930 --> 03:02:22.930]  Nick's wanker elbow
[03:02:22.930 --> 03:02:23.730]  flared up again.
[03:02:23.730 --> 03:02:24.530]  It flared up again?
[03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:28.930]  Old professional injury.
[03:02:29.130 --> 03:02:29.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:32.910 --> 03:02:34.130]  I went semi.
[03:02:38.610 --> 03:02:39.590]  What's this way, though?
[03:02:39.610 --> 03:02:40.250]  Where are you?
[03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:41.750]  He's up to the upper left.
[03:02:42.570 --> 03:02:44.290]  I guess I should go this way.
[03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:48.070]  This way.
[03:02:49.470 --> 03:02:50.810]  Oh, the goods store, Geoff.
[03:02:50.810 --> 03:02:51.230]  Mm.
[03:02:54.570 --> 03:02:55.690]  Uh-oh.
[03:02:55.950 --> 03:02:56.750]  Shut up.
[03:02:57.690 --> 03:02:58.250]  No!
[03:03:00.610 --> 03:03:02.530]  This is about to get interesting.
[03:03:03.470 --> 03:03:06.250]  And now it's out of stock, right?
[03:03:06.530 --> 03:03:07.090]  Yeah.
[03:03:09.010 --> 03:03:10.290]  Because of the tariffs.
[03:03:11.890 --> 03:03:13.010]  And then...
[03:03:13.010 --> 03:03:14.370]  Oh, it looks like the tariffs
[03:03:14.370 --> 03:03:15.610]  hadn't taken effect yet.
[03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:16.970]  That was the last boat.
[03:03:16.970 --> 03:03:18.770]  He went ahead
[03:03:18.770 --> 03:03:19.850]  and stocked up early.
[03:03:20.850 --> 03:03:22.990]  You'll probably want to commemorate this, right?
[03:03:24.590 --> 03:03:25.430]  By doing what?
[03:03:29.770 --> 03:03:31.070]  You're the one that's gonna have to
[03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:32.610]  fix it later when we need to record
[03:03:32.610 --> 03:03:34.310]  and it doesn't work. And I'm gonna go,
[03:03:34.390 --> 03:03:35.350]  I don't know, Gavin did something.
[03:03:35.950 --> 03:03:36.910]  Well, that is true.
[03:03:39.570 --> 03:03:39.970]  Oh!
[03:03:40.430 --> 03:03:40.970]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:44.350]  Jesus Christ, Gavin.
[03:03:44.350 --> 03:03:45.010]  Gavin, are you all right?
[03:03:45.130 --> 03:03:45.930]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:47.690 --> 03:03:49.370]  Geoff is like...
[03:03:49.370 --> 03:03:51.890]  You're making money moves, dude.
[03:03:52.290 --> 03:03:54.130]  I don't have any stars. I got zero fucking stars.
[03:03:54.850 --> 03:03:55.910]  You're not losing, though.
[03:03:56.390 --> 03:03:57.450]  You're about to get two.
[03:03:58.330 --> 03:04:00.230]  Compliments are the worst.
[03:04:01.450 --> 03:04:02.170]  I'll remember that.
[03:04:06.090 --> 03:04:06.610]  Oh!
[03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:10.050]  Glug, glug.
[03:04:11.890 --> 03:04:12.290]  Glug, glug.
[03:04:12.290 --> 03:04:13.090]  Is that what you do with keys?
[03:04:17.370 --> 03:04:18.990]  Did you eat a key as a kid?
[03:04:19.790 --> 03:04:21.010]  Did someone eat a key?
[03:04:21.170 --> 03:04:21.470]  Did you?
[03:04:22.230 --> 03:04:25.590]  What the fuck is he talking about?
[03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:27.050]  He said glug, glug on the key!
[03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:29.410]  That'd be drinking a key, surely.
[03:04:29.430 --> 03:04:30.550]  This guy's nuts. Let me go piss.
[03:04:31.570 --> 03:04:33.090]  I took off my microphone.
[03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:36.330]  There's a mute button on the mic.
[03:04:36.650 --> 03:04:38.250]  Go ahead and raise the levels
[03:04:38.250 --> 03:04:39.390]  on the bathroom mic.
[03:04:39.970 --> 03:04:41.590]  Cut to bathroom camera.
[03:04:46.290 --> 03:04:48.150]  What are you thinking of doing with that?
[03:04:48.910 --> 03:04:50.310]  Wait, you can put it on the lift?
[03:04:50.730 --> 03:04:52.130]  Yeah, of course I can.
[03:04:54.810 --> 03:04:55.790]  All right.
[03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:58.870]  Feeling pretty, pretty.
[03:04:59.410 --> 03:04:59.830]  I'm fine.
[03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:01.250]  Wow!
[03:05:03.050 --> 03:05:03.330]  Whoa!
[03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.170]  Shit.
[03:05:05.650 --> 03:05:06.670]  Everything's coming up, Nick.
[03:05:06.850 --> 03:05:07.070]  Uh-oh.
[03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:09.030]  I don't think so.
[03:05:09.670 --> 03:05:11.710]  Yeah, that's a real rough ending.
[03:05:12.770 --> 03:05:13.050]  Oh!
[03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:14.630]  Rough beginning.
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:20.980]  Now get your Bowser.
[03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:26.940]  It's like,
[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:28.040]  you didn't kill my buddy?
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:31.640]  Is he just gonna go for a straight-up
[03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:32.740]  thievin'? Yep.
[03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:33.180]  No!
[03:05:33.180 --> 03:05:33.420]  No!
[03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:42.810]  There's now four in the tank, is that right?
[03:05:42.910 --> 03:05:43.510]  That's right.
[03:05:45.370 --> 03:05:47.070]  Enough to turn the tide forever.
[03:05:47.210 --> 03:05:48.410]  I gotta get my anus over there.
[03:05:48.450 --> 03:05:49.610]  You gotta stop with that fuckin' button.
[03:05:50.730 --> 03:05:51.290]  This one?
[03:05:52.350 --> 03:05:53.190]  No, I didn't look.
[03:05:53.890 --> 03:05:56.730]  What, this one?
[03:05:57.430 --> 03:05:58.150]  No, I won't do it again.
[03:06:00.130 --> 03:06:00.970]  Ah, shit, I can't.
[03:06:05.300 --> 03:06:07.000]  Okay, this should go...
[03:06:07.560 --> 03:06:09.260]  It's such a bad area to be.
[03:06:10.020 --> 03:06:11.260]  This should probably be...
[03:06:12.520 --> 03:06:14.400]  Like, can it go on that?
[03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:15.000]  No.
[03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:18.320]  Oof.
[03:06:20.140 --> 03:06:21.980]  That is a rough stretch.
[03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:22.640]  Yeah.
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.540]  Yeah, that's not good.
[03:06:26.500 --> 03:06:29.460]  This whole area is, uh...
[03:06:29.460 --> 03:06:30.680]  It's a danger zone.
[03:06:30.760 --> 03:06:31.400]  Why don't you roll a one?
[03:06:31.720 --> 03:06:32.180]  Okay.
[03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:38.320]  I'm so excited to be recording out of here.
[03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:39.040]  No, no, no.
[03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:40.000]  This is gonna be...
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.200]  Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:45.960]  This is gonna be so much fun.
[03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:46.520]  This is great.
[03:06:47.380 --> 03:06:49.000]  We got a cool fuckin' place.
[03:06:49.280 --> 03:06:49.960]  This is great.
[03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:52.640]  Andrew's a little robot.
[03:06:52.840 --> 03:06:54.140]  Did the piss make you recognize that?
[03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:56.500]  I just feel so much better after taking that.
[03:06:57.920 --> 03:06:58.720]  That piss.
[03:06:58.940 --> 03:06:59.960]  You got lucky there, bud.
[03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:02.800]  That could've been way worse.
[03:07:03.520 --> 03:07:05.220]  Yeah, you got, uh...
[03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:07.220]  Hey, is Ray in the chat?
[03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:09.160]  I just opened my laptop back up.
[03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:10.200]  He left his own stream?
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:13.600]  Did Ray gift a bunch of subs?
[03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:14.360]  What?
[03:07:14.680 --> 03:07:17.040]  I don't know! I had to go piss!
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:17.920]  Why didn't you read it?
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:20.580]  A hundred subs from Ray.
[03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:21.720]  Oh, Ray!
[03:07:23.980 --> 03:07:26.220]  A sofa and a hundred subs.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:27.380]  Yeah, this is your old sofa.
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:29.060]  Thank you for the old sofa.
[03:07:29.260 --> 03:07:29.720]  Thanks, Ray.
[03:07:29.980 --> 03:07:30.620]  Ray, you're the best.
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:31.460]  Ray, this is great.
[03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:34.140]  I take back all those things Gavin said about you.
[03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:36.300]  Ray, I still never met you.
[03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:37.660]  You never met Ray?
[03:07:38.320 --> 03:07:39.000]  Are you an idiot?
[03:07:39.740 --> 03:07:41.380]  It's a bit of a letdown in person.
[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:44.060]  X-Ray and Beth!
[03:07:46.220 --> 03:07:48.420]  How was playing video games with Chibi?
[03:07:50.320 --> 03:07:51.480]  Chibi's a lunatic!
[03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:53.140]  I love Chibi now.
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:54.240]  It was fun.
[03:07:55.700 --> 03:07:58.100]  It took about 30 seconds for Chibi to win me over.
[03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:00.100]  Joke's on you, fucker!
[03:08:00.880 --> 03:08:01.520]  Oh, no!
[03:08:02.540 --> 03:08:04.000]  I'm already a broken man.
[03:08:04.220 --> 03:08:05.220]  He gave you coins!
[03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:07.060]  He gave you coins!
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:09.180]  That's all bad for you.
[03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:11.000]  Did he take them from the vault?
[03:08:11.560 --> 03:08:12.900]  Or was that his personal coins?
[03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:14.940]  It might have been his coin purse.
[03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:18.560]  I love that we were just all sat here quietly while Ray dropped a hundred subs.
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:21.000]  We didn't know. Eric left.
[03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:21.800]  Eric wasn't at work.
[03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:26.080]  He left the station off the air again.
[03:08:27.060 --> 03:08:27.860]  Snow brawl!
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:30.920]  Someone needs to clip that and send it to Chibi.
[03:08:31.120 --> 03:08:31.680]  Just you guys going,
[03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:32.300]  Oh, I love Chibi.
[03:08:32.900 --> 03:08:34.040]  She's gonna go nuts.
[03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:34.700]  Oh, what's this?
[03:08:34.800 --> 03:08:36.040]  Oh, monkey fight!
[03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:42.460]  Okay, everyone hit start.
[03:08:42.980 --> 03:08:44.920]  Everyone just pick up one ball immediately.
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:45.720]  Come on, Great Bape, let's go!
[03:08:46.080 --> 03:08:48.280]  Throw it at Geoff's face.
[03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:48.940]  Great Bape.
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:50.400]  I'm devastated.
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:52.240]  I'm gonna have to throw these at my friends.
[03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:54.340]  Come on, army of monkeys.
[03:08:54.340 --> 03:08:55.280]  The monkeys are over there, dude.
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:08:56.660]  We got this.
[03:08:58.120 --> 03:08:58.480]  Dude.
[03:09:06.460 --> 03:09:08.360]  I just had a flashback to dodgeball.
[03:09:12.020 --> 03:09:13.480]  We should see if Ray wants to come over.
[03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:15.480]  I mean, not today.
[03:09:15.880 --> 03:09:18.620]  I don't want him to see all the stuff he gave us and realize he won it back.
[03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:20.540]  He's just going like,
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:21.560]  Oh, that stuff was actually good.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:22.580]  I didn't mean to give you that.
[03:09:23.380 --> 03:09:24.880]  Actually, that couch is comfortable.
[03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:26.720]  Is this one of my computers?
[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:28.580]  Bye!
[03:09:33.180 --> 03:09:36.240]  Where are you going?
[03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:37.440]  Probably do this.
[03:09:37.540 --> 03:09:38.520]  Going straight for it?
[03:09:40.700 --> 03:09:41.640]  I don't know why I wouldn't.
[03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:42.360]  Weird move.
[03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:45.480]  I don't know why you would.
[03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:50.520]  All the way up.
[03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:51.120]  That was a lot of distances.
[03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:55.020]  That feels like that was appropriate.
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:00.960]  Are you guys trying to get to the vault?
[03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:02.200]  I am.
[03:10:05.580 --> 03:10:06.960]  I'll go ahead and take that star.
[03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:08.300]  Most of Andrew's shit is in there.
[03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:15.160]  I did not want to go up against this big boy in the background there.
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:17.380]  I think Geoff could take this whole game.
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:18.200]  Hey, shut up.
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:21.340]  I'm believing in him.
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:21.740]  It's close.
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:24.540]  Stop, dude.
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:26.320]  You know what happens.
[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:29.080]  It's right in Geoff's path.
[03:10:29.140 --> 03:10:30.900]  And I got a little star steal right in front of it.
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:34.420]  You've won it.
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:35.780]  You've won that star.
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:39.040]  I don't know. Someone might have more than me.
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:40.640]  Nobody does.
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:43.800]  Oh!
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:45.740]  Now I won't do it anymore.
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:47.080]  Oh!
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:49.000]  That's a money maker.
[03:10:49.240 --> 03:10:49.620]  That's good.
[03:10:51.060 --> 03:10:52.500]  That's great, Geoff.
[03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:55.020]  That's fantastic.
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:10:57.480]  Wow.
[03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:04.140]  If only you had a key.
[03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:05.300]  I know.
[03:11:05.400 --> 03:11:06.360]  I was thinking about that.
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:07.520]  You know what?
[03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:07.880]  Nope.
[03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:08.600]  I'm done with it.
[03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:19.540]  Oh, this is bad.
[03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:19.960]  Did you avoid it?
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:22.700]  I might have. Oh, thank God.
[03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:23.600]  No!
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:26.100]  Oh, you get to pick.
[03:11:28.140 --> 03:11:29.540]  You wanted it to go to Dilko.
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:30.940]  I don't want it to go to anyone.
[03:11:31.220 --> 03:11:32.780]  It's going to go to Bowser in a second.
[03:11:35.140 --> 03:11:35.580]  Dang.
[03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:39.480]  That's what I thought.
[03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:40.280]  The payoff.
[03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:43.760]  Do you remember back when you had four stars?
[03:11:44.660 --> 03:11:45.440]  Yeah, that was fun.
[03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:46.560]  You've only got one now.
[03:11:48.460 --> 03:11:49.640]  Oh, back in third.
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:50.960]  Just win the vault, dude.
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:54.400]  You're like my 401k in 2025.
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:11:57.720]  Man, no kidding.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:11:59.440]  Woof.
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:05.400]  Thanks for making America unretireable again.
[03:12:06.920 --> 03:12:08.360]  Yeah, this time it wasn't the bankers.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:08.740]  Interesting.
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:12.620]  Oh, God.
[03:12:12.740 --> 03:12:13.640]  Oh, this is interesting.
[03:12:13.740 --> 03:12:14.280]  What does this mean?
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:15.440]  Is it for me?
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:18.080]  No, I think you're past me.
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:18.780]  Oh, shit.
[03:12:21.980 --> 03:12:22.660]  That's going to hurt.
[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:25.820]  Right in your eyeballs.
[03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:27.460]  Little toasty.
[03:12:28.880 --> 03:12:29.780]  No, no.
[03:12:31.080 --> 03:12:31.860]  You got the key?
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:34.000]  Get me the hell out of here.
[03:12:34.380 --> 03:12:35.800]  Who was I going to land on?
[03:12:35.880 --> 03:12:36.120]  Yours.
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:38.120]  Ah.
[03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:41.020]  Take it out of one pocket, put it in the other.
[03:12:41.180 --> 03:12:42.460]  Oh, is there boo in there?
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:43.740]  I can't afford boo.
[03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:46.460]  Say never mind, fool.
[03:12:46.940 --> 03:12:47.560]  Yeah, say never mind.
[03:12:51.700 --> 03:12:53.000]  He didn't say never mind.
[03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:53.740]  Oh.
[03:12:54.340 --> 03:12:55.460]  I can still...
[03:12:55.460 --> 03:12:56.160]  I just opened the door.
[03:12:56.260 --> 03:12:57.540]  Can we all go through it now?
[03:12:58.080 --> 03:12:59.660]  Is it permanently open now?
[03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:01.580]  There's two chance times.
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:03.440]  This is good.
[03:13:05.380 --> 03:13:05.860]  Nice.
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:08.540]  That's an unfortunate amount of coins.
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:11.860]  This is definitely a random.
[03:13:12.720 --> 03:13:13.240]  Yeah, really.
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:15.200]  Let's have a look at the scores.
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:19.860]  I'm in fourth.
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:20.920]  What are you in?
[03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:25.100]  Every time it just goes to the person with the most coins.
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:26.240]  It's fair.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:28.580]  Is that true? Is that how it works?
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:30.260]  So far it has worked this game.
[03:13:30.780 --> 03:13:33.280]  It certainly didn't that one fucking game.
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:34.520]  Oof.
[03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:35.400]  Well, not bad.
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:37.660]  Still can't afford boo, but alright.
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:38.880]  Well, you're on boo.
[03:13:39.880 --> 03:13:41.060]  I mean the next boo.
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:44.120]  Always thinking about that next boo.
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:46.500]  Ooh.
[03:13:46.940 --> 03:13:47.380]  Wow.
[03:13:47.380 --> 03:13:47.660]  Wow.
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:49.060]  Interesting.
[03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:53.700]  That is a deliberate chance time.
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:54.020]  Yep.
[03:13:54.720 --> 03:13:56.700]  Time to lose the star I got.
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:13:57.820]  Here we go.
[03:13:59.120 --> 03:13:59.360]  One.
[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:00.480]  Yes!
[03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:03.800]  Damn.
[03:14:04.220 --> 03:14:04.580]  Back to Nick.
[03:14:07.320 --> 03:14:10.680]  And I'm still stuck in this fucking square.
[03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:10.880]  You are.
[03:14:11.180 --> 03:14:13.880]  Because you flipped it back the other way.
[03:14:14.480 --> 03:14:15.520]  Unbagging first.
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:16.340]  Unbelievable.
[03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:18.140]  That's bad for the rest of us with traps.
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:22.480]  Incredible.
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:23.440]  Back.
[03:14:23.740 --> 03:14:25.820]  Go back again, stupid.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:27.820]  Incredible.
[03:14:29.180 --> 03:14:29.660]  Ugh.
[03:14:31.220 --> 03:14:31.700]  Minigame.
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:34.860]  I hate this game.
[03:14:35.820 --> 03:14:37.080]  We're getting on towards the end.
[03:14:37.240 --> 03:14:37.840]  This is crazy.
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:40.360]  I think I prefer to play this over 30 days.
[03:14:40.580 --> 03:14:40.960]  Is that true?
[03:14:40.960 --> 03:14:41.540]  Yes.
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:44.260]  This is like...
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:46.740]  You don't like a game of Mario Party that's longer than the Titanic?
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:48.540]  This is so long.
[03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:50.240]  It's insane.
[03:14:50.780 --> 03:14:51.880]  Oh, shit.
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:04.200]  Okay, Wario.
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:05.360]  Alright, chill out.
[03:15:07.420 --> 03:15:08.900]  He likes the pictures.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.080]  Middle one.
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:21.580]  It's not there.
[03:15:26.190 --> 03:15:26.750]  Wait.
[03:15:26.850 --> 03:15:27.230]  Oops.
[03:15:27.430 --> 03:15:29.550]  We're all fucking stupid.
[03:15:32.130 --> 03:15:33.030]  Idiot flags!
[03:15:34.310 --> 03:15:34.350]  Yep.
[03:15:34.730 --> 03:15:35.610]  Fire in the chair!
[03:15:36.590 --> 03:15:37.030]  Right.
[03:15:40.390 --> 03:15:41.210]  Oh, that's a gamble.
[03:15:41.210 --> 03:15:43.430]  The middle one's a great... shit.
[03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.890]  Thanks, Eric.
[03:15:44.250 --> 03:15:46.870]  Wow, I can't believe...
[03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:50.010]  that is what we were trying to do the last round.
[03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:50.290]  Yeah.
[03:15:50.290 --> 03:15:51.930]  Oh, there's three of us.
[03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:53.630]  Oh, it's that one.
[03:15:53.890 --> 03:15:54.390]  First one.
[03:15:55.010 --> 03:15:55.410]  Shit!
[03:15:59.530 --> 03:16:00.410]  Hey, you know what?
[03:16:02.130 --> 03:16:02.570]  Fuck!
[03:16:06.450 --> 03:16:08.290]  Look, it's a risk someone's gonna take.
[03:16:08.970 --> 03:16:09.370]  Do we?
[03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.270]  Yeah.
[03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:12.250]  Like, for example...
[03:16:12.250 --> 03:16:12.950]  Yeah!
[03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:16.610]  It's good, you're playing the mind game.
[03:16:16.610 --> 03:16:18.210]  It's like, they're not gonna do it back-to-back, right?
[03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:23.520]  Locked in. I love this.
[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:24.720]  Uh-oh.
[03:16:25.260 --> 03:16:26.620]  Damn, it worked that time.
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:27.720]  I can't believe that.
[03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:30.860]  People like graves.
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:32.440]  Damn.
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:34.720]  Not me, what about that?
[03:16:35.780 --> 03:16:36.180]  Wow.
[03:16:37.380 --> 03:16:37.780]  Okay.
[03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:41.260]  Right leaf, right leaf.
[03:16:41.380 --> 03:16:42.920]  Well, Gavin, I don't think it's that one.
[03:16:43.180 --> 03:16:43.360]  Shit!
[03:16:43.360 --> 03:16:43.400]  Shit!
[03:16:46.930 --> 03:16:47.530]  Oh!
[03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:49.190]  What?
[03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.850]  Oops.
[03:16:50.590 --> 03:16:53.730]  I hit the wrong button.
[03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.490]  Finish!
[03:16:58.570 --> 03:17:00.150]  I wish you'd hit the right one.
[03:17:00.490 --> 03:17:01.890]  Another Gil win!
[03:17:06.570 --> 03:17:08.470]  We gotta put a mic on it.
[03:17:09.030 --> 03:17:09.790]  Oh, that's amazing.
[03:17:11.830 --> 03:17:13.750]  Look at Wario, he looks bashful.
[03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.730]  Still last.
[03:17:19.870 --> 03:17:21.690]  It's Animorphs, it's on the subreddit.
[03:17:21.810 --> 03:17:23.250]  I really recommend checking it out.
[03:17:23.610 --> 03:17:24.230]  Uh-oh.
[03:17:24.690 --> 03:17:25.250]  Very good.
[03:17:25.450 --> 03:17:26.730]  This is getting old, says Bowser.
[03:17:27.230 --> 03:17:28.450]  Blue-eyed JJ.
[03:17:29.470 --> 03:17:31.850]  If you're just coming into the stream in the last little bit,
[03:17:31.950 --> 03:17:33.490]  we did an office tour at the beginning,
[03:17:33.610 --> 03:17:35.330]  which we'll clip and make a video later.
[03:17:35.770 --> 03:17:37.410]  This stream will be out Thursday?
[03:17:37.410 --> 03:17:38.530]  Yeah, probably.
[03:17:38.930 --> 03:17:41.210]  And then, uh, what else?
[03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:43.830]  Oh, we put out a Minecraft video today.
[03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:44.490]  That's true!
[03:17:45.490 --> 03:17:47.330]  Yeah, check it out later. Watch the rest of this.
[03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.850]  We went back.
[03:17:49.430 --> 03:17:49.610]  Yep.
[03:17:50.730 --> 03:17:51.390]  Oh, Geoff.
[03:17:52.430 --> 03:17:53.350]  What are you gonna do?
[03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:53.990]  Ray!
[03:17:57.390 --> 03:17:58.890]  Did I just scroll up?
[03:17:59.970 --> 03:18:00.850]  Oh, I scrolled up.
[03:18:00.850 --> 03:18:01.490]  You're just yelling about Ray?
[03:18:01.730 --> 03:18:02.930]  Yeah, I thought it was live.
[03:18:02.930 --> 03:18:03.530]  Never mind.
[03:18:04.570 --> 03:18:06.610]  That was like 20 minutes ago.
[03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:07.270]  Jesus.
[03:18:07.830 --> 03:18:09.610]  Listen, my computer's old.
[03:18:11.190 --> 03:18:11.670]  God.
[03:18:12.030 --> 03:18:14.050]  And we played games on it?
[03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:15.850]  He records on it.
[03:18:15.870 --> 03:18:17.910]  Like, record records on it.
[03:18:18.090 --> 03:18:19.950]  Even though he was sent a nicer computer.
[03:18:20.130 --> 03:18:20.570]  Like it? Yep.
[03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:23.630]  Tell the chats just say Ray.
[03:18:26.310 --> 03:18:26.790]  Ridiculous.
[03:18:27.890 --> 03:18:29.330]  We should clip the bit of chat
[03:18:29.330 --> 03:18:30.510]  where he dropped 100 subs
[03:18:30.510 --> 03:18:32.470]  and then fast forward to Andrew going,
[03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.830]  Ray!
[03:18:33.610 --> 03:18:35.410]  With a time difference in between.
[03:18:37.530 --> 03:18:38.490]  Oh shit.
[03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:39.530]  Oh shit.
[03:18:39.730 --> 03:18:40.650]  Now we're talking.
[03:18:41.470 --> 03:18:42.910]  Who are you gonna do?
[03:18:43.010 --> 03:18:45.230]  Wait, are you doing coins?
[03:18:46.090 --> 03:18:46.450]  Geoff.
[03:18:48.210 --> 03:18:49.150]  Why'd you do coins?
[03:18:50.110 --> 03:18:51.810]  I didn't do coins.
[03:18:51.970 --> 03:18:52.390]  You did the star.
[03:18:53.890 --> 03:18:56.510]  Dude, I legitimately thought you picked coins.
[03:18:56.530 --> 03:18:58.310]  I got so nervous for you, that freaked me out.
[03:18:58.310 --> 03:18:58.910]  I'm sorry.
[03:19:00.830 --> 03:19:01.490]  Oh no.
[03:19:01.730 --> 03:19:02.350]  That's rough.
[03:19:03.350 --> 03:19:04.710]  That was just chance, man.
[03:19:05.390 --> 03:19:06.650]  Hey look, he had enough for Boo.
[03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:09.330]  I don't care.
[03:19:09.770 --> 03:19:12.110]  I was gonna land on a star, and he has the gold pipe.
[03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:13.310]  You can do that forever if you want.
[03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:15.370]  I'll take it as a punishment.
[03:19:19.430 --> 03:19:21.190]  I cannot wait for you to crash this.
[03:19:25.850 --> 03:19:29.650]  Don't worry, I didn't turn Matt Braggs with like 800 screenshots in his file.
[03:19:32.910 --> 03:19:33.690]  I'll take some more.
[03:19:34.470 --> 03:19:38.230]  Geoff's about to get another star, and then he's gonna have the gold pipe to get another star.
[03:19:38.610 --> 03:19:38.890]  Yep, yep.
[03:19:39.010 --> 03:19:39.910]  It's gonna be crazy.
[03:19:40.370 --> 03:19:45.170]  And then, just to add insult to injury, he can whistle us away from the next fucking one.
[03:19:45.430 --> 03:19:46.770]  Yeah, but he can do star steal too.
[03:19:46.770 --> 03:19:47.870]  He can steal a star from you.
[03:19:48.190 --> 03:19:48.770]  He's not listening.
[03:19:49.370 --> 03:19:50.150]  Let's lock down.
[03:19:50.590 --> 03:19:51.330]  Listen to this.
[03:19:54.490 --> 03:19:56.230]  Oh, see, now he can just get rid of the whistle.
[03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:57.490]  Or the gold pipe.
[03:20:00.250 --> 03:20:01.290]  Mark the Frog.
[03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:03.150]  Man, I wish I was out fishing today.
[03:20:03.570 --> 03:20:03.910]  Thanks, Mark.
[03:20:05.530 --> 03:20:06.790]  I'm fishing for stars.
[03:20:06.870 --> 03:20:07.590]  Thanks for stopping by, man.
[03:20:11.790 --> 03:20:12.650]  It's a tough call.
[03:20:13.810 --> 03:20:14.070]  Okay.
[03:20:15.410 --> 03:20:18.030]  Onion Rings with Ranch says whoever gets the vault probably wins.
[03:20:18.030 --> 03:20:19.090]  I agree with that.
[03:20:19.190 --> 03:20:20.870]  I think the vault is gonna be the key.
[03:20:21.270 --> 03:20:22.530]  Onion Rings with Ranch sounds pretty good.
[03:20:22.670 --> 03:20:24.050]  I just hope somebody opens it.
[03:20:24.190 --> 03:20:25.990]  Oh, right. Onion Rings sounds good.
[03:20:28.650 --> 03:20:29.090]  Well.
[03:20:29.350 --> 03:20:30.350]  Didn't the direction change?
[03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:31.850]  Am I going away from the vault again?
[03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.990]  Shit.
[03:20:34.430 --> 03:20:35.910]  You're on your own path.
[03:20:36.270 --> 03:20:38.430]  This is a Geoff game to lose.
[03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:40.890]  Alright, well, I'm fucked now.
[03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.510]  Thank you.
[03:20:42.510 --> 03:20:43.510]  That's the end of Geoff.
[03:20:47.130 --> 03:20:48.770]  Let's see where the next star is, though.
[03:20:52.350 --> 03:20:53.270]  Oh, cool.
[03:20:53.530 --> 03:20:54.610]  On the way.
[03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:56.050]  Where are we in reference to this?
[03:20:56.570 --> 03:20:57.250]  You'll never know.
[03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:58.890]  I'm in the gates.
[03:20:59.930 --> 03:21:01.430]  Oh, it's the long way.
[03:21:01.810 --> 03:21:02.850]  Oh, no.
[03:21:03.070 --> 03:21:05.590]  I hate that.
[03:21:05.730 --> 03:21:07.250]  Bowser the long way.
[03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:08.050]  Put it in the vault.
[03:21:08.050 --> 03:21:09.150]  Put it in the vault.
[03:21:09.450 --> 03:21:10.210]  Put it in the vault.
[03:21:12.450 --> 03:21:13.550]  It's going into the vault.
[03:21:15.090 --> 03:21:17.250]  On the upside, he can't afford the star.
[03:21:18.330 --> 03:21:19.130]  Beastween 99.
[03:21:19.350 --> 03:21:20.870]  Truly no way Geoff could lose this one.
[03:21:21.470 --> 03:21:22.050]  No way?
[03:21:23.250 --> 03:21:23.450]  Yeah.
[03:21:24.810 --> 03:21:26.410]  That's what me and Beastween are saying.
[03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.990]  Did you say Beastweener?
[03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:30.110]  Yeah, dude. Me and Beastween are chilling out.
[03:21:30.250 --> 03:21:32.070]  Fucking saying Geoff can't lose.
[03:21:32.270 --> 03:21:33.450]  Did you say Beastweener?
[03:21:36.450 --> 03:21:39.070]  So to clarify, it was Beastweener.
[03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:41.870]  Me and Beastweener.
[03:21:42.690 --> 03:21:43.610]  I'm not fucking around with this one.
[03:21:45.450 --> 03:21:46.850]  I'm glad I didn't.
[03:21:47.250 --> 03:21:47.570]  Wow.
[03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:48.290]  Nice.
[03:21:48.670 --> 03:21:49.630]  Big style.
[03:21:49.850 --> 03:21:50.250]  Let's go big.
[03:21:50.250 --> 03:21:51.350]  You're going to get a crack at the vault.
[03:21:52.190 --> 03:21:52.490]  Yep.
[03:21:52.730 --> 03:21:53.590]  Crack that vault.
[03:21:54.090 --> 03:21:54.610]  Yes.
[03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:58.530]  Dipping into Borderlands territory.
[03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:04.390]  Alright.
[03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:10.410]  Where's the next one?
[03:22:11.950 --> 03:22:13.250]  My friend Slip said,
[03:22:13.490 --> 03:22:15.150]  like the Celtics in Game 2
[03:22:15.150 --> 03:22:16.890]  when I turned off the game in the third quarter
[03:22:16.890 --> 03:22:18.850]  and never bothered checking in on the final score.
[03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:20.530]  This is Geoff game for sure.
[03:22:20.770 --> 03:22:21.470]  Oh, God.
[03:22:22.450 --> 03:22:24.070]  Maybe Game 3 or something.
[03:22:25.630 --> 03:22:27.230]  Nick, choose with your heart.
[03:22:27.370 --> 03:22:27.970]  I say 81.
[03:22:28.230 --> 03:22:30.250]  I'm going to say...
[03:22:30.250 --> 03:22:31.110]  Eric's birthday.
[03:22:32.250 --> 03:22:32.730]  41!
[03:22:33.890 --> 03:22:34.370]  41!
[03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:35.230]  Thanks, man. I'm just kidding.
[03:22:35.390 --> 03:22:36.210]  I appreciate you.
[03:22:36.930 --> 03:22:38.190]  I'm just kidding.
[03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:40.750]  That was funny.
[03:22:51.560 --> 03:22:53.220]  A little bit of shopping.
[03:22:55.200 --> 03:22:57.020]  How do I want to play this?
[03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:05.300]  Tina has come in
[03:23:05.300 --> 03:23:07.900]  and gifted 50 subs
[03:23:07.900 --> 03:23:09.760]  because Tina is incredible
[03:23:09.760 --> 03:23:11.100]  and we're sitting on her couch.
[03:23:11.340 --> 03:23:12.440]  Tina, thanks for the subs.
[03:23:13.060 --> 03:23:13.840]  Thanks for the couch.
[03:23:14.100 --> 03:23:15.420]  Thank you, Tina.
[03:23:16.660 --> 03:23:18.180]  Not only thank you for the subs and the couch,
[03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:19.740]  but thank you for the ottoman as well.
[03:23:20.180 --> 03:23:21.560]  I'm sitting on that.
[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:23.160]  It looks comfy.
[03:23:24.080 --> 03:23:27.140]  If it wasn't for Tina and Ray, we'd be sat on the floor.
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:29.580]  That's absolutely true.
[03:23:30.480 --> 03:23:31.260]  Alright, Wario.
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:31.900]  Alright, let's see.
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:33.460]  Do I want to hit the chance time?
[03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:35.220]  Or is there something good ahead of me?
[03:23:35.920 --> 03:23:37.520]  See, I saw Tina get the subs right away.
[03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:39.960]  I can't wait for Andrew
[03:23:39.960 --> 03:23:41.280]  to see it in about 20 minutes.
[03:23:41.620 --> 03:23:43.960]  Yeah, I think I'm going to
[03:23:43.960 --> 03:23:44.640]  chance time it up.
[03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:45.280]  Tina!
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:48.520]  Interesting.
[03:23:49.460 --> 03:23:51.520]  I think I'm going to do it. I'm going to cause some trouble
[03:23:53.260 --> 03:23:54.320]  for maybe me.
[03:23:54.520 --> 03:23:55.440]  Look at that cool car.
[03:23:57.060 --> 03:23:57.800]  It's a monster truck.
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:23:58.780]  When is that going to be ready?
[03:24:02.650 --> 03:24:03.590]  Two is alright, right?
[03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:04.610]  There was two of them?
[03:24:09.250 --> 03:24:11.630]  I should have got the first one and then hit the second one afterwards.
[03:24:11.950 --> 03:24:13.590]  Yeah, that was an interesting decision you made.
[03:24:13.590 --> 03:24:16.070]  I just didn't want to be too far from the vault that I don't get to play.
[03:24:16.130 --> 03:24:16.430]  Yeah.
[03:24:20.540 --> 03:24:21.380]  Alright, Andrew.
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:26.300]  How involved do you want to be in this?
[03:24:28.740 --> 03:24:29.060]  Whee!
[03:24:32.440 --> 03:24:33.320]  Not at all.
[03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:34.400]  Okay.
[03:24:40.230 --> 03:24:41.350]  I'd rather not.
[03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.830]  Give me a star.
[03:24:43.570 --> 03:24:44.670]  An ideal if I wasn't.
[03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.910]  I mean, okay.
[03:24:46.330 --> 03:24:49.210]  It would be great because all I have is coins.
[03:24:49.650 --> 03:24:51.730]  As long as I don't have to give coins away.
[03:24:53.270 --> 03:24:54.250]  Andrew, hit the button.
[03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.710]  Hit it!
[03:24:57.230 --> 03:24:58.370]  He has to wake up.
[03:24:58.410 --> 03:24:59.170]  It's going to take forever.
[03:24:59.450 --> 03:24:59.770]  Hit!
[03:25:01.690 --> 03:25:02.730]  Oh, shit!
[03:25:02.730 --> 03:25:02.950]  Fuck!
[03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:05.230]  What a bollock.
[03:25:05.330 --> 03:25:09.930]  I was hoping for a full-blown star swap.
[03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:11.230]  You're a piece of shit.
[03:25:15.370 --> 03:25:16.450]  To the vault!
[03:25:17.230 --> 03:25:17.490]  Let me in!
[03:25:18.850 --> 03:25:20.550]  That could have been good for you.
[03:25:21.650 --> 03:25:22.670]  You won't get that close.
[03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:24.730]  The ridge is too big.
[03:25:29.190 --> 03:25:29.690]  Wow!
[03:25:30.370 --> 03:25:31.950]  Get me out of here.
[03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:32.630]  You might make it out.
[03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:35.650]  Give me.
[03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:39.470]  A lot of stars, a lot of coins.
[03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:40.550]  There's a lot going on.
[03:25:43.590 --> 03:25:45.310]  Thank you, game.
[03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:47.830]  You got a star.
[03:25:51.480 --> 03:25:52.420]  Where are you putting it?
[03:25:52.900 --> 03:25:54.740]  Right there.
[03:25:55.020 --> 03:25:56.040]  Oh, lovely.
[03:25:56.500 --> 03:25:57.240]  Next to Nick.
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:58.360]  Okay.
[03:25:58.740 --> 03:25:59.620]  Give me these coins.
[03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:00.080]  Wow.
[03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:09.590]  You go right.
[03:26:09.930 --> 03:26:10.870]  Got it.
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:20.300]  Do you not want this star?
[03:26:21.660 --> 03:26:22.960]  What in the world?
[03:26:23.240 --> 03:26:23.900]  Do you have a secret
[03:26:23.900 --> 03:26:25.260]  shadow alliance with Geoff?
[03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:26.760]  I'm going for the vault.
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:30.240]  This is the price
[03:26:30.240 --> 03:26:31.080]  to go into the vault.
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:32.920]  It's giving me a star.
[03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:35.140]  I don't have a choice.
[03:26:35.700 --> 03:26:37.620]  He has three already.
[03:26:37.760 --> 03:26:38.680]  Yeah, I don't have a choice.
[03:26:38.840 --> 03:26:39.480]  He has four now.
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:40.400]  What do you mean?
[03:26:41.180 --> 03:26:45.100]  I can't afford boo.
[03:26:46.120 --> 03:26:46.620]  Neither can I.
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:47.200]  I have the money.
[03:26:48.660 --> 03:26:49.660]  Oh, shit.
[03:26:50.380 --> 03:26:51.680]  Better go to me than Bowser.
[03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:53.160]  This is crazy.
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:55.920]  Give me the coins.
[03:26:56.560 --> 03:26:57.840]  He's going to give you coins.
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:26:59.380]  He's going to feel fucking bad.
[03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:01.700]  I made him give to Nick.
[03:27:01.700 --> 03:27:03.280]  Bowser just came back.
[03:27:03.320 --> 03:27:04.380]  Jesus Christ.
[03:27:06.320 --> 03:27:07.960]  I'm getting to this vault.
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:11.340]  Are there idiot flags?
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:11.980]  Yes!
[03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:14.580]  They're crazy.
[03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:16.800]  I want an idiot flag retraction
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:18.100]  when I open that vault.
[03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:21.320]  You guys should consider buying the idiot flag
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:22.020]  in our store.
[03:27:23.220 --> 03:27:25.840]  Let it fly big style.
[03:27:26.580 --> 03:27:27.680]  Let it fly real style.
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:28.740]  God damn.
[03:27:30.620 --> 03:27:31.580]  What the...
[03:27:31.580 --> 03:27:32.760]  Ratty boy shirts,
[03:27:32.900 --> 03:27:34.260]  both available in all sizes.
[03:27:35.900 --> 03:27:36.900]  That's a cool little...
[03:27:37.300 --> 03:27:38.200]  Oh, shit.
[03:27:40.460 --> 03:27:40.940]  Well...
[03:27:40.940 --> 03:27:41.620]  Okey dokey.
[03:27:42.640 --> 03:27:43.420]  Alright, here we go.
[03:27:44.040 --> 03:27:44.860]  Okey dokey.
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:49.120]  This is 30 seconds.
[03:27:49.380 --> 03:27:49.960]  What are you doing?
[03:27:51.660 --> 03:27:52.700]  What are you doing?
[03:27:53.380 --> 03:27:55.040]  You have to pay attention, buddy.
[03:27:55.340 --> 03:27:58.440]  I got flummoxed by that move.
[03:28:01.280 --> 03:28:03.040]  This is Dillkong's to win, baby.
[03:28:03.380 --> 03:28:04.000]  Dillkong time.
[03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:04.860]  Dill all day.
[03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:05.660]  He got this, Dillkong.
[03:28:07.780 --> 03:28:09.020]  He's Dilldog Dylan.
[03:28:10.380 --> 03:28:11.080]  Uh-oh.
[03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:11.960]  Uh-oh.
[03:28:13.080 --> 03:28:14.040]  For Canada!
[03:28:15.700 --> 03:28:16.720]  Can't stop the Dills.
[03:28:18.340 --> 03:28:18.960]  Well done, Dill.
[03:28:19.220 --> 03:28:19.860]  Thank you.
[03:28:20.580 --> 03:28:21.900]  Dill, you little bastard.
[03:28:25.860 --> 03:28:27.200]  The only star I'm going to get
[03:28:27.200 --> 03:28:28.100]  is the minigame star.
[03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:29.740]  That's all I got going for him.
[03:28:30.220 --> 03:28:31.580]  Hopefully they won't include it this time.
[03:28:31.580 --> 03:28:32.460]  That would be perfect.
[03:28:33.380 --> 03:28:35.200]  Hopefully it'll be a reaction star.
[03:28:37.100 --> 03:28:38.260]  New turn.
[03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:39.800]  It is. Uh-oh.
[03:28:40.900 --> 03:28:41.720]  Turn 25.
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:43.320]  We're getting there.
[03:28:43.900 --> 03:28:47.340]  Let's see.
[03:28:47.900 --> 03:28:50.200]  What an anniversary celebration
[03:28:50.200 --> 03:28:51.560]  it's been all day long here
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:54.580]  at the regulation office.
[03:28:54.580 --> 03:28:56.560]  Who let Geoff get so many pipes?
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:28:58.000]  He's going crazy mode.
[03:28:59.140 --> 03:29:00.060]  You hit the pipe.
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:02.040]  I'm hitting the pipe.
[03:29:06.740 --> 03:29:07.880]  Roll a four.
[03:29:08.140 --> 03:29:08.660]  Ah, shit.
[03:29:10.700 --> 03:29:11.940]  We're relying on Bowser
[03:29:11.940 --> 03:29:14.580]  to stop the thing now.
[03:29:15.140 --> 03:29:16.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:29:16.840 --> 03:29:18.120]  Are you sure you want a star?
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:19.240]  Are you sure?
[03:29:19.360 --> 03:29:21.060]  You can say no three times and then say yes.
[03:29:21.060 --> 03:29:22.620]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[03:29:23.980 --> 03:29:25.120]  Geoff's using pipes.
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:25.940]  The pipe layer.
[03:29:26.680 --> 03:29:29.140]  Yeah, dude, you got explicit reasons.
[03:29:29.340 --> 03:29:29.840]  That's awesome.
[03:29:32.900 --> 03:29:34.280]  Let's see where the next star is.
[03:29:36.400 --> 03:29:37.240]  All right.
[03:29:38.400 --> 03:29:39.100]  Top left
[03:29:39.100 --> 03:29:40.020]  where Andrew could have gone.
[03:29:41.140 --> 03:29:41.740]  Don't need to.
[03:29:43.020 --> 03:29:43.680]  Yeah, right.
[03:29:43.940 --> 03:29:46.780]  When he gets to the vault
[03:29:46.780 --> 03:29:49.000]  and he gets the numbers wrong, Gavin, what's going to happen?
[03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:51.260]  Probably Geoff will know the number.
[03:29:52.220 --> 03:29:52.740]  Wow!
[03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:54.000]  What?
[03:29:54.120 --> 03:29:55.320]  What a roll.
[03:29:56.020 --> 03:29:56.860]  Great roll.
[03:29:57.480 --> 03:29:59.600]  Dude, we got Monty Moles in the fucking chat.
[03:30:00.340 --> 03:30:01.680]  People want the mole to win.
[03:30:02.500 --> 03:30:03.440]  Is it mole time in chat?
[03:30:03.540 --> 03:30:05.120]  Dude, it's fucking mole time in the chat.
[03:30:08.260 --> 03:30:11.380]  Did I ever tell you guys about the first gang I ever joined?
[03:30:11.960 --> 03:30:13.300]  Like a violence gang?
[03:30:13.880 --> 03:30:14.780]  We weren't violent.
[03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:16.560]  We were diggers.
[03:30:17.620 --> 03:30:19.280]  And you were in a gang?
[03:30:19.600 --> 03:30:20.800]  Yeah, we caught ourselves...
[03:30:20.800 --> 03:30:22.880]  I had some friends when I lived in Oregon,
[03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:25.520]  my second house in Oregon before I moved to Florida.
[03:30:25.720 --> 03:30:27.600]  We caught ourselves the mole rats.
[03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:28.360]  Whoa!
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:32.120]  And you had to be in the mole rats.
[03:30:32.320 --> 03:30:34.540]  You had to rip a Coca-Cola can in half
[03:30:34.540 --> 03:30:35.640]  and have half of the can
[03:30:35.640 --> 03:30:37.320]  and the other mole rats all had half of the can.
[03:30:37.420 --> 03:30:37.780]  Wow.
[03:30:38.460 --> 03:30:41.020]  I think I fought you in the beginning of Fallout 3.
[03:30:41.120 --> 03:30:42.120]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:30:42.500 --> 03:30:44.240]  The first thing you shoot with a BB gun.
[03:30:44.240 --> 03:30:46.660]  It's interesting that it all comes back around to the moles.
[03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:47.020]  Yeah.
[03:30:48.620 --> 03:30:50.680]  Mole rats rise up in the chat.
[03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:51.860]  Dude, mole rats stand up.
[03:30:52.120 --> 03:30:53.080]  They're going crazy.
[03:30:54.480 --> 03:30:57.200]  That was the spot to trap that one.
[03:30:57.260 --> 03:30:58.120]  Everyone's landing on that.
[03:30:59.940 --> 03:31:00.360]  Damn.
[03:31:02.440 --> 03:31:02.880]  Precarious.
[03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:06.120]  Oh, is it Wario time?
[03:31:06.240 --> 03:31:06.820]  Yeah, it is.
[03:31:07.060 --> 03:31:09.480]  I'm gonna be so fucking mad if he opens that vault.
[03:31:09.500 --> 03:31:09.720]  Three.
[03:31:09.720 --> 03:31:10.260]  Three.
[03:31:11.660 --> 03:31:12.140]  Oh!
[03:31:13.580 --> 03:31:15.540]  Alright, let's see.
[03:31:15.640 --> 03:31:18.200]  Gavin, how are you feeling about it?
[03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:19.320]  I know the code.
[03:31:19.720 --> 03:31:20.420]  Oh, okay.
[03:31:22.440 --> 03:31:23.080]  I know it.
[03:31:23.220 --> 03:31:23.960]  Feels pretty good about it then.
[03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:27.340]  Alright chat, what's the code?
[03:31:27.480 --> 03:31:28.800]  Six stars, 280 coins.
[03:31:30.660 --> 03:31:30.920]  Oh!
[03:31:33.580 --> 03:31:34.060]  Oh!
[03:31:34.780 --> 03:31:35.000]  Oh!
[03:31:36.800 --> 03:31:36.880]  Oh!
[03:31:37.920 --> 03:31:39.140]  That's alright, Andrew won't get there.
[03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:40.200]  I just turned the thing around.
[03:31:40.420 --> 03:31:41.800]  Oh my god!
[03:31:41.980 --> 03:31:43.320]  Get me to the vault!
[03:31:44.840 --> 03:31:45.020]  Oh!
[03:31:47.560 --> 03:31:48.360]  Oh shit.
[03:31:50.360 --> 03:31:50.760]  Crazy.
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:52.840]  You need a drink?
[03:31:52.900 --> 03:31:53.400]  Does anyone want anything?
[03:31:54.700 --> 03:31:56.320]  I'll take a diet, Dr. Pepper.
[03:31:57.040 --> 03:31:58.940]  Or whatever it is, Pepper Zero.
[03:31:59.920 --> 03:32:00.560]  What you gonna buy?
[03:32:04.780 --> 03:32:05.720]  That was not me.
[03:32:06.400 --> 03:32:07.040]  Someone else?
[03:32:07.300 --> 03:32:08.040]  That was Andrew, I think.
[03:32:08.400 --> 03:32:08.780]  That was me.
[03:32:10.520 --> 03:32:12.180]  I was just drinking my soda when it happened.
[03:32:15.300 --> 03:32:15.660]  Oh!
[03:32:19.280 --> 03:32:21.100]  The vault determines the winner.
[03:32:21.800 --> 03:32:22.180]  Go right.
[03:32:23.900 --> 03:32:26.360]  I think the bullshit stars at the end tend to, but yeah.
[03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:30.520]  Wait, which way is it facing now?
[03:32:31.560 --> 03:32:32.720]  That's not it, I'm still going this way.
[03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:37.600]  Yowza!
[03:32:40.020 --> 03:32:41.460]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[03:32:41.580 --> 03:32:42.100]  I don't care.
[03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:46.960]  I prepared for this.
[03:32:49.960 --> 03:32:51.840]  I'm getting out of here, I'm getting to this vault.
[03:32:54.580 --> 03:32:55.380]  Roll a one.
[03:32:55.900 --> 03:32:58.300]  No, no, no.
[03:32:58.400 --> 03:32:59.880]  That's the only thing that could go wrong.
[03:33:00.080 --> 03:33:01.060]  Roll a one.
[03:33:01.200 --> 03:33:01.680]  Oh!
[03:33:01.680 --> 03:33:02.320]  Oh!
[03:33:05.180 --> 03:33:07.800]  That's the second time someone landed on that one too.
[03:33:08.100 --> 03:33:08.860]  Here's your soda.
[03:33:08.920 --> 03:33:09.840]  Thank you.
[03:33:10.720 --> 03:33:12.100]  And a kolache for you.
[03:33:15.840 --> 03:33:16.940]  I'm getting there.
[03:33:20.810 --> 03:33:22.090]  Double the coins.
[03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:25.010]  2v2.
[03:33:25.690 --> 03:33:26.290]  Hello again.
[03:33:26.470 --> 03:33:27.270]  Hello, Nick.
[03:33:27.970 --> 03:33:29.670]  I got up and everyone just said Ray.
[03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:32.590]  He did it again?
[03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:34.330]  No, he didn't do anything.
[03:33:34.370 --> 03:33:35.110]  They did it again?
[03:33:35.270 --> 03:33:37.050]  I dare him to do it again. He won't.
[03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:40.250]  He won't.
[03:33:40.490 --> 03:33:42.550]  Player in the back is left and right.
[03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.650]  I'm in the front.
[03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.510]  Okay.
[03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:49.730]  Easy.
[03:33:54.050 --> 03:33:54.530]  Easy!
[03:33:58.430 --> 03:34:00.030]  Let's just nail this.
[03:34:00.030 --> 03:34:00.910]  Yeah.
[03:34:01.470 --> 03:34:02.510]  Here we go, monkey.
[03:34:03.650 --> 03:34:04.130]  Okay.
[03:34:05.470 --> 03:34:06.790]  I'm going to move this to the right.
[03:34:07.450 --> 03:34:08.370]  You want to go right first?
[03:34:08.930 --> 03:34:10.210]  Can't we do both at the same time?
[03:34:11.230 --> 03:34:11.710]  Nice!
[03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:14.910]  God damn it.
[03:34:15.010 --> 03:34:15.930]  Just wait for it.
[03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:18.690]  Up, up, up!
[03:34:19.290 --> 03:34:20.010]  Now down!
[03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.570]  Down!
[03:34:24.310 --> 03:34:25.270]  Pick one!
[03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:28.890]  Go, go, go!
[03:34:29.010 --> 03:34:29.810]  Go, go, go!
[03:34:29.810 --> 03:34:30.070]  Go, go, go!
[03:34:30.490 --> 03:34:30.950]  Go!
[03:34:40.850 --> 03:34:42.750]  You guys suck.
[03:34:43.370 --> 03:34:44.170]  Damn it.
[03:34:45.150 --> 03:34:46.790]  Do you not want to be somewhere?
[03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.990]  Go up!
[03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:51.490]  What do you want?
[03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:52.310]  There's a cone!
[03:34:53.050 --> 03:34:55.410]  Andrew, please.
[03:34:55.790 --> 03:34:57.190]  I'm working with you!
[03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:58.690]  Right, up!
[03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.710]  Right!
[03:35:01.210 --> 03:35:02.150]  Down!
[03:35:03.250 --> 03:35:05.010]  Why down there?
[03:35:05.490 --> 03:35:06.390]  It's just arbitrary.
[03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:09.050]  Sorry.
[03:35:09.350 --> 03:35:09.610]  That's okay.
[03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.930]  Up!
[03:35:19.100 --> 03:35:20.680]  Keep going, just keep going.
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:21.340]  Yes!
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:24.340]  Good try though.
[03:35:24.340 --> 03:35:25.380]  Unbelievable.
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:29.880]  It's amazing.
[03:35:30.500 --> 03:35:32.000]  Amazing we lost.
[03:35:32.120 --> 03:35:33.940]  Considering whatever that was on their end.
[03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:36.320]  It was good teamwork blocking you guys.
[03:35:36.320 --> 03:35:38.100]  Blocking in front of you was pretty good.
[03:35:39.300 --> 03:35:40.140]  Fucking asshole.
[03:35:45.260 --> 03:35:46.540]  That ruled.
[03:35:47.540 --> 03:35:48.360]  Oh, shit.
[03:35:48.400 --> 03:35:48.960]  That was funny.
[03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:51.900]  Who's getting the chump gift?
[03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:54.920]  Alright, Andrew, remember.
[03:35:55.140 --> 03:35:57.080]  Don't just pick a mushroom.
[03:35:59.660 --> 03:36:00.580]  Preview of the last level.
[03:36:01.020 --> 03:36:02.860]  Just rifle through this, who cares?
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:06.220]  That's what I'm talking about, who gives a shit.
[03:36:06.340 --> 03:36:07.180]  Let's do it, boys!
[03:36:07.440 --> 03:36:07.880]  Rifling.
[03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:09.240]  Third place to decide.
[03:36:11.140 --> 03:36:12.240]  Remember, it doesn't move.
[03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:12.880]  Okay.
[03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:16.920]  One star exchange, what does that mean?
[03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:17.360]  Yep.
[03:36:18.420 --> 03:36:18.840]  Do it.
[03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:21.540]  What does that mean?
[03:36:21.780 --> 03:36:22.340]  Who knows?
[03:36:22.460 --> 03:36:24.180]  Oh, it's just a place you can get a star.
[03:36:25.900 --> 03:36:26.260]  Okay.
[03:36:27.240 --> 03:36:28.440]  Two stars on the map.
[03:36:29.100 --> 03:36:30.440]  I did not know that's what that was called.
[03:36:31.060 --> 03:36:32.960]  I had no clue, yeah, I've never heard that term.
[03:36:34.020 --> 03:36:35.540]  So where does the gold pipe take you then?
[03:36:37.860 --> 03:36:38.660]  Let's find out.
[03:36:39.240 --> 03:36:40.500]  Let's find out.
[03:36:41.720 --> 03:36:42.080]  Luigi.
[03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:43.140]  Luigi!
[03:36:49.380 --> 03:36:51.560]  You'll roll numbers that you don't want to roll.
[03:36:55.920 --> 03:36:57.400]  Alright, mole boy.
[03:36:58.180 --> 03:36:58.980]  Oh, this sucks.
[03:37:03.220 --> 03:37:04.660]  Throw one of these down.
[03:37:05.100 --> 03:37:05.580]  Good idea.
[03:37:09.680 --> 03:37:10.320]  Yeah.
[03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:14.100]  Now it's time to take the pain.
[03:37:18.980 --> 03:37:19.460]  Fuck.
[03:37:19.800 --> 03:37:20.920]  Oh, good roll.
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:24.260]  Uh-oh.
[03:37:24.740 --> 03:37:25.420]  Uh-oh!
[03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:27.220]  Uh-oh.
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:37.580]  Didn't go for the vault.
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:39.520]  You didn't get a star.
[03:37:39.640 --> 03:37:40.840]  Anything else is up by...
[03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:41.540]  Oh, there you go.
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:42.720]  Two additional stars.
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:47.640]  You don't have any coins to spend, so...
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:49.200]  Why even let you stop?
[03:37:49.640 --> 03:37:51.500]  Hey, you fucking suck, keep going.
[03:37:51.900 --> 03:37:52.520]  Kick rocks, idiot.
[03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:53.760]  Anyone got a whistle?
[03:37:54.700 --> 03:37:55.120]  Geoff does.
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:37:57.080]  I can't buy one.
[03:37:58.580 --> 03:37:59.600]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[03:37:59.680 --> 03:38:02.300]  I'm just gonna have to hope I get lucky in a minigame or something.
[03:38:02.780 --> 03:38:04.000]  Maybe a Bowser revolution.
[03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:06.500]  Please no.
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:08.620]  Gavin, I think you're onto something.
[03:38:11.060 --> 03:38:12.540]  Such a good spot for it.
[03:38:12.560 --> 03:38:13.320]  It's a good spot.
[03:38:13.820 --> 03:38:16.100]  Alright, here we go.
[03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:18.120]  Yeah!
[03:38:18.880 --> 03:38:20.020]  Ooh, pretty good.
[03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:20.920]  Big eights.
[03:38:23.860 --> 03:38:25.020]  Get them coins.
[03:38:30.470 --> 03:38:31.450]  But do you want...
[03:38:31.450 --> 03:38:31.750]  Okay.
[03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:34.670]  No hesitation.
[03:38:36.050 --> 03:38:36.450]  Damn.
[03:38:39.190 --> 03:38:40.890]  I can't wait to get to the vault.
[03:38:47.980 --> 03:38:48.760]  Roll a four.
[03:38:48.860 --> 03:38:51.240]  I mean, if I only had one star, I'd probably feel the same way.
[03:38:51.460 --> 03:38:53.440]  What if you had zero?
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:56.080]  I'd definitely feel the same way.
[03:39:00.500 --> 03:39:01.080]  Ooh.
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:02.080]  Alright.
[03:39:03.940 --> 03:39:05.840]  I'm not gonna get to the vault at that speed.
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:06.420]  No.
[03:39:07.280 --> 03:39:07.860]  Ooh.
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:11.940]  Wow, a minigame for this, huh?
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:13.340]  Give me a golden pipe.
[03:39:14.640 --> 03:39:15.680]  Please don't.
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:16.960]  Oh, you can't get it.
[03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:18.700]  Yeah, he sucks at this.
[03:39:19.040 --> 03:39:21.340]  When do I look at...
[03:39:21.340 --> 03:39:22.120]  Oh, dear.
[03:39:22.580 --> 03:39:28.400]  He doesn't understand is so fucking funny.
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:30.340]  It's like, did I say that about my dog?
[03:39:31.780 --> 03:39:32.440]  Nailed it.
[03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:33.380]  I don't know, what does that do?
[03:39:34.580 --> 03:39:35.920]  I should've gone for the trip, really.
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:37.220]  Yeah, probably.
[03:39:37.380 --> 03:39:40.220]  I was just looking at the chest when it started moving, and I was locked in.
[03:39:43.020 --> 03:39:43.380]  Oh.
[03:39:44.260 --> 03:39:45.960]  It's just an item, not a star.
[03:39:48.140 --> 03:39:49.340]  So you can steal it.
[03:39:50.180 --> 03:39:50.900]  Vault time!
[03:39:52.400 --> 03:39:52.760]  Oh.
[03:39:53.920 --> 03:39:54.860]  Is that enough?
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:39:56.720]  No.
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:39:58.660]  Yes, it is.
[03:39:58.660 --> 03:39:59.020]  No, it is.
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:01.960]  This is gonna be a disaster.
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:03.520]  And it's gonna go to a star steal, isn't it?
[03:40:06.220 --> 03:40:07.340]  Well, five is my...
[03:40:07.340 --> 03:40:08.060]  Alright, Andrew, what do you think?
[03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:09.560]  Five's my lucky number.
[03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:11.560]  Please don't be.
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:12.520]  Please don't be.
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:14.180]  Yeah!
[03:40:15.720 --> 03:40:17.680]  Where are the idiot flags now?
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:19.880]  Where are the idiot flags now?
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:22.620]  Where are the idiot flags?
[03:40:22.620 --> 03:40:23.020]  Where are the idiot flags?
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:26.500]  They're not to the store.
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:27.900]  Don't return them to the store.
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:28.700]  Thank you.
[03:40:29.300 --> 03:40:29.900]  Wow.
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:33.040]  Take that!
[03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:35.600]  Crucified Donkey!
[03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:37.680]  50 Gifted Stars!
[03:40:37.920 --> 03:40:39.700]  Thank you so much, Crucified!
[03:40:40.580 --> 03:40:42.300]  The vault is open!
[03:40:46.280 --> 03:40:46.780]  Give me that!
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:47.680]  What?
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:49.760]  It's him.
[03:40:49.980 --> 03:40:51.000]  Oh, shit.
[03:40:51.640 --> 03:40:52.840]  He crapped it.
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:56.640]  Dude, that's gonna be so much in a Bowser revolution.
[03:40:56.760 --> 03:40:57.380]  That's so exciting.
[03:40:57.520 --> 03:40:58.920]  Oh, yeah, we gotta get it.
[03:41:00.580 --> 03:41:03.480]  I've never seen so many coins in one pocket.
[03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:04.200]  Dude, wild.
[03:41:05.980 --> 03:41:09.320]  I can't believe that grab on the 26th turn.
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:12.140]  Oh, God, are you guys gonna get more money?
[03:41:12.320 --> 03:41:12.720]  Yeah!
[03:41:14.540 --> 03:41:15.920]  I'm gonna buy every shop.
[03:41:17.260 --> 03:41:18.160]  I can't wait
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:19.820]  to see how I lose all six of these.
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:21.880]  You could probably
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:23.900]  just pay Bowser off at this point.
[03:41:24.380 --> 03:41:24.680]  Okay.
[03:41:25.340 --> 03:41:27.520]  Oh, we're just grabbing coins, okay.
[03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:29.640]  You piece of shit!
[03:41:30.380 --> 03:41:31.540]  He hasn't started!
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:33.480]  Wasn't sure anything.
[03:41:34.940 --> 03:41:36.260]  He was learning that he's a piece of shit.
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:36.500]  Yeah.
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:41.120]  Oh, you fuck!
[03:41:45.740 --> 03:41:46.700]  You dickhead!
[03:41:49.620 --> 03:41:50.060]  Ow!
[03:41:50.140 --> 03:41:50.520]  Ow!
[03:41:50.740 --> 03:41:51.040]  Ow!
[03:41:51.180 --> 03:41:51.460]  Ow!
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:41:57.440]  Just bullied him.
[03:41:57.920 --> 03:41:59.260]  Bullied him off the edge.
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:00.580]  Nick, you stupid!
[03:42:01.140 --> 03:42:03.520]  There you go.
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:04.800]  Going too fast for my own good.
[03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:06.700]  Ow!
[03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.770]  Die!
[03:42:12.610 --> 03:42:13.750]  That's fine, we shared them.
[03:42:15.190 --> 03:42:15.650]  Yeah, great.
[03:42:15.730 --> 03:42:16.570]  Andrew needs more money.
[03:42:16.570 --> 03:42:16.990]  Yeah.
[03:42:21.410 --> 03:42:22.970]  Was it worth knocking this over?
[03:42:23.310 --> 03:42:24.830]  I mean, I got little bits of satisfaction
[03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:25.810]  every time one of you dropped.
[03:42:25.970 --> 03:42:27.930]  More so than the coins I would have gotten.
[03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:30.210]  If I was playing properly.
[03:42:33.350 --> 03:42:33.750]  388!
[03:42:34.890 --> 03:42:35.210]  Yes!
[03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:37.650]  What can we do?
[03:42:38.290 --> 03:42:39.630]  We did chance times.
[03:42:41.230 --> 03:42:42.510]  A chance time would do it.
[03:42:43.770 --> 03:42:44.810]  Chance time would do it.
[03:42:46.850 --> 03:42:47.330]  Fuck!
[03:42:52.230 --> 03:42:54.710]  This game has gone so badly for me.
[03:42:54.730 --> 03:42:55.530]  So crazy!
[03:42:55.890 --> 03:42:59.970]  That was my life.
[03:43:00.770 --> 03:43:01.370]  For three weeks.
[03:43:03.490 --> 03:43:04.390]  I can't believe
[03:43:04.390 --> 03:43:05.130]  that was the code.
[03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:08.170]  I can't believe we made you enough money to get that star.
[03:43:09.730 --> 03:43:10.950]  I really appreciate it.
[03:43:11.010 --> 03:43:11.670]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[03:43:12.750 --> 03:43:14.650]  You could have gotten more coins.
[03:43:14.650 --> 03:43:16.750]  What are the coins for?
[03:43:16.990 --> 03:43:18.850]  To stop you from getting coins.
[03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:19.650]  To do what?
[03:43:19.730 --> 03:43:20.830]  So I can buy a star.
[03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:24.510]  He's got you there.
[03:43:25.270 --> 03:43:26.950]  I like Nick because it's not like
[03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:28.790]  he plays the long game or the short game.
[03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:30.370]  He's just simply playing the game.
[03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:31.390]  I'm playing the now game.
[03:43:32.330 --> 03:43:33.630]  For a good time, not a long time.
[03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:36.550]  Andrew caused the whole chat to have to retract an idiot flag.
[03:43:36.650 --> 03:43:37.710]  Pretty incredible.
[03:43:37.790 --> 03:43:38.630]  Flags down.
[03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.730]  Incredible.
[03:43:42.210 --> 03:43:44.490]  And then Crucified Donkey with the 50 gifted.
[03:43:44.850 --> 03:43:45.930]  Thank you so much.
[03:43:46.690 --> 03:43:47.510]  Way to go, Donkey.
[03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:48.470]  What are you doing there, bud?
[03:43:49.930 --> 03:43:50.790]  I'm just thinking.
[03:43:52.410 --> 03:43:54.530]  Because Gavin can steal one of my things.
[03:43:54.770 --> 03:43:55.890]  Oh yeah, what can I get?
[03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:58.210]  So if I get two chompers
[03:43:58.210 --> 03:43:59.350]  and he can only steal one,
[03:43:59.430 --> 03:44:00.690]  I still have my second chomper.
[03:44:01.230 --> 03:44:02.030]  I can't believe that.
[03:44:04.990 --> 03:44:05.970]  Where are you headed?
[03:44:05.970 --> 03:44:07.810]  To where the star was.
[03:44:14.130 --> 03:44:15.410]  Damn it.
[03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:20.370]  No one's gone anywhere near any of my traps.
[03:44:20.730 --> 03:44:20.890]  Nope.
[03:44:24.330 --> 03:44:24.870]  Nice.
[03:44:26.890 --> 03:44:28.250]  Andrew had no stars
[03:44:28.250 --> 03:44:29.870]  like two turns ago.
[03:44:31.570 --> 03:44:32.530]  That vault.
[03:44:33.370 --> 03:44:34.050]  Six star vault.
[03:44:34.850 --> 03:44:38.410]  Well, there's still ten coins in it, so...
[03:44:38.410 --> 03:44:39.810]  Hey, Jay, the joke's on you.
[03:44:50.490 --> 03:44:51.670]  Oh, you didn't go to the shop?
[03:44:52.590 --> 03:44:53.070]  No.
[03:44:54.390 --> 03:44:55.170]  He wanted the mushroom.
[03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:57.590]  There you go.
[03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:58.990]  Double dice? Nice.
[03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:01.030]  Alright, I'm on my way.
[03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.670]  I have a plan.
[03:45:04.050 --> 03:45:05.110]  What's your plan, Gavin?
[03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:07.690]  Let's roll dice.
[03:45:08.250 --> 03:45:10.210]  Is that your star steal?
[03:45:11.310 --> 03:45:12.050]  The what?
[03:45:12.050 --> 03:45:13.630]  Your other star steal?
[03:45:15.850 --> 03:45:17.210]  I think you're locked in now.
[03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:20.090]  Oh, that worked out, though.
[03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:22.910]  No one's down there.
[03:45:23.190 --> 03:45:24.430]  Geoff's right behind you!
[03:45:24.570 --> 03:45:26.270]  I'll put it down next turn, then.
[03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:28.110]  More coins?
[03:45:29.530 --> 03:45:30.210]  Rich get richer.
[03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:32.610]  Gavin!
[03:45:33.350 --> 03:45:34.850]  You should go to the right, go to the vault.
[03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:35.530]  Go to the vault.
[03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:39.830]  What's the thing up here?
[03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:40.650]  Go to the vault.
[03:45:41.330 --> 03:45:42.250]  No, there's Boo up there.
[03:45:42.970 --> 03:45:43.410]  No.
[03:45:44.930 --> 03:45:46.990]  The vault's got 10 coins in it.
[03:45:47.310 --> 03:45:48.490]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:45:49.610 --> 03:45:51.830]  Is the gate open still, or did it relock?
[03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.830]  It relocked.
[03:45:54.730 --> 03:45:55.830]  Andrew said it relocked.
[03:45:56.490 --> 03:45:57.170]  Sounds like a lie.
[03:45:57.350 --> 03:45:58.130]  Go right.
[03:45:58.970 --> 03:46:00.730]  I don't think that gate up top was ever open.
[03:46:00.990 --> 03:46:01.450]  It wasn't.
[03:46:05.040 --> 03:46:06.260]  Listen, I know what we can do.
[03:46:07.460 --> 03:46:09.320]  We can go steal Andrew's stars.
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:12.840]  I have to love the sound of that.
[03:46:16.880 --> 03:46:22.560]  Oh, shit!
[03:46:23.160 --> 03:46:24.240]  This might work out for Nick.
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:31.640]  Every trap you put down
[03:46:31.640 --> 03:46:32.480]  gets you a star!
[03:46:32.680 --> 03:46:33.060]  Yes!
[03:46:33.060 --> 03:46:33.080]  Yes!
[03:46:37.960 --> 03:46:38.360]  Jesus!
[03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:40.500]  I'm in first place again.
[03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:42.840]  I really should have put that trap down.
[03:46:42.880 --> 03:46:43.240]  Yeah!
[03:46:45.160 --> 03:46:47.100]  Andrew never needs to worry about money again
[03:46:47.100 --> 03:46:47.900]  as long as he lives.
[03:46:49.360 --> 03:46:51.320]  I'm going to need that to give you all stars.
[03:46:52.940 --> 03:46:54.900]  I guess you truly are a dillionaire.
[03:46:56.620 --> 03:46:57.060]  Oh, yay.
[03:46:57.160 --> 03:46:57.620]  12 more.
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:01.540]  We equal 410.
[03:47:02.160 --> 03:47:03.360]  Andrew's just living off interest.
[03:47:03.920 --> 03:47:07.060]  Oh, another double the coins?
[03:47:09.020 --> 03:47:09.260]  Oh!
[03:47:10.000 --> 03:47:11.020]  Hey, just let me win.
[03:47:13.060 --> 03:47:14.440]  We can't let him get any more money.
[03:47:15.500 --> 03:47:16.360]  I don't think it matters.
[03:47:16.520 --> 03:47:17.140]  It doesn't matter.
[03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:19.660]  It does if he gets a star for it in the end.
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:21.300]  What do you mean? I have 410.
[03:47:22.500 --> 03:47:24.240]  You're going to really stop me from getting it.
[03:47:24.240 --> 03:47:24.860]  Yeah, why not?
[03:47:31.480 --> 03:47:35.080]  Easy, baby.
[03:47:35.280 --> 03:47:35.820]  Walk in.
[03:47:37.900 --> 03:47:38.880]  Let's just not get hit.
[03:47:41.240 --> 03:47:42.460]  Let's just not get hit.
[03:47:45.920 --> 03:47:47.500]  He's just doing circles in the middle.
[03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:48.320]  Let's just not get hit.
[03:47:52.620 --> 03:47:53.060]  Nice.
[03:47:58.440 --> 03:47:59.460]  Nick's having fun.
[03:47:59.540 --> 03:48:00.360]  Yeah, I'm having a great time.
[03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:03.500]  Nick's just having fun with his friends.
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:04.560]  Nick, stop.
[03:48:04.840 --> 03:48:05.400]  Nick, you can get me.
[03:48:06.620 --> 03:48:07.360]  Nick, stop.
[03:48:08.860 --> 03:48:09.740]  I quit.
[03:48:10.940 --> 03:48:12.600]  Like Nintendo analyzing that game.
[03:48:12.740 --> 03:48:15.100]  I want to stop moving three seconds before the end.
[03:48:16.700 --> 03:48:17.860]  I wasn't going to catch you.
[03:48:19.920 --> 03:48:21.180]  You don't want to waste the energy.
[03:48:21.300 --> 03:48:22.280]  Yeah, I hear that.
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:23.360]  I got a lot of schemes.
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:26.780]  Sometimes Nick has four stars.
[03:48:27.100 --> 03:48:27.560]  Crazy.
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:30.060]  They're all star steal spaces too.
[03:48:31.520 --> 03:48:32.000]  Oops.
[03:48:41.130 --> 03:48:42.270]  Nick's doing some maps.
[03:48:42.470 --> 03:48:42.670]  Yeah, I'm thinking.
[03:48:42.970 --> 03:48:44.290]  Alright, we're on 28 of 30.
[03:48:45.190 --> 03:48:47.410]  Guys, you got to lock in who's winning this thing.
[03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:49.050]  Know it in your hearts.
[03:48:49.650 --> 03:48:51.150]  There's like ten traps on the board.
[03:48:51.170 --> 03:48:52.330]  Yeah, it's real bad.
[03:48:52.870 --> 03:48:53.750]  Hell yeah.
[03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:55.570]  Let's see what happens.
[03:48:55.870 --> 03:48:57.290]  Sure, who cares.
[03:48:58.970 --> 03:48:59.850]  Wow, he looks really funny.
[03:49:00.010 --> 03:49:00.710]  He does look funny.
[03:49:02.990 --> 03:49:03.430]  Headbutt.
[03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:05.190]  Oh!
[03:49:06.230 --> 03:49:06.950]  Wow, okay.
[03:49:08.110 --> 03:49:08.550]  Interesting.
[03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:10.210]  That was good for you.
[03:49:11.650 --> 03:49:12.610]  Just roll big.
[03:49:12.690 --> 03:49:13.450]  Is that right behind me?
[03:49:14.390 --> 03:49:14.830]  Damn.
[03:49:17.130 --> 03:49:18.610]  Yeah, I think it is right behind you.
[03:49:19.430 --> 03:49:20.490]  Son of a bitch.
[03:49:24.090 --> 03:49:26.870]  Oh, it's Mario time?
[03:49:27.010 --> 03:49:28.550]  What if we make a gentleman's agreement?
[03:49:28.730 --> 03:49:30.030]  If I one-shot the vault,
[03:49:30.290 --> 03:49:32.130]  guess it first try, I win?
[03:49:32.310 --> 03:49:33.770]  No, I don't think you're going to make it.
[03:49:33.770 --> 03:49:35.430]  Okay, if you get it first try, I'll think about it.
[03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:37.570]  I'll think about it.
[03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.830]  That worked.
[03:49:43.190 --> 03:49:43.710]  Yeah, great.
[03:49:45.010 --> 03:49:51.850]  Oh, boy.
[03:49:52.330 --> 03:49:52.610]  Random.
[03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.850]  Random.
[03:49:56.050 --> 03:49:58.470]  You hit random, you might take mine.
[03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:59.990]  Yeah, I thought I was thinking about that.
[03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:02.150]  Which is very funny.
[03:50:02.570 --> 03:50:03.450]  And then I would say,
[03:50:04.130 --> 03:50:05.090]  It's the funniest move.
[03:50:05.090 --> 03:50:07.930]  It's the funniest move for a comedy podcast.
[03:50:07.930 --> 03:50:08.790]  It's so funny.
[03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:09.890]  There's nothing funny in that!
[03:50:12.770 --> 03:50:14.250]  I felt pretty funny.
[03:50:15.310 --> 03:50:16.490]  Geoff made it pretty funny.
[03:50:18.210 --> 03:50:19.810]  Thank you for proving my point, Geoff.
[03:50:20.370 --> 03:50:21.830]  You guys don't understand comedy!
[03:50:22.430 --> 03:50:24.270]  I like the start of the demo, it's just going,
[03:50:24.430 --> 03:50:25.390]  Content, it's content.
[03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:28.330]  Content company.
[03:50:28.510 --> 03:50:29.430]  That's fucking great.
[03:50:30.850 --> 03:50:32.350]  Screaming, there's nothing funny in that.
[03:50:32.350 --> 03:50:33.890]  That was wild, I absolutely would have been
[03:50:33.890 --> 03:50:35.270]  peer pressured into doing random there.
[03:50:35.410 --> 03:50:36.870]  Oh, I thought about it, but I didn't.
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:41.760]  Fucking prick.
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:45.440]  I needed to buy some.
[03:50:46.700 --> 03:50:47.620]  Oh shit, Ray?
[03:50:51.240 --> 03:50:51.440]  Now,
[03:50:52.180 --> 03:50:53.740]  These have really been working for me.
[03:50:54.000 --> 03:50:55.160]  Yeah, sounds good.
[03:50:55.260 --> 03:50:56.380]  You've got two whole turns left.
[03:50:56.460 --> 03:50:58.760]  I was going to say, I don't get why you would buy them now,
[03:50:58.860 --> 03:50:59.580]  but yeah, absolutely.
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:00.660]  100% dude.
[03:51:00.940 --> 03:51:03.300]  Because Dilkong's right behind you.
[03:51:03.540 --> 03:51:04.800]  Yeah for Dilkong!
[03:51:12.380 --> 03:51:13.980]  Oh, that was close.
[03:51:14.720 --> 03:51:15.400]  Mother...
[03:51:15.400 --> 03:51:16.280]  Piss!
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:17.780]  Oh, Mother Piss.
[03:51:19.240 --> 03:51:20.660]  My favorite famous Broadway play.
[03:51:22.580 --> 03:51:22.940]  Ooh!
[03:51:24.480 --> 03:51:25.160]  Cool.
[03:51:25.320 --> 03:51:25.880]  More dice!
[03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:29.360]  If you could roll low,
[03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:30.280]  that would be fantastic.
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:33.300]  We're not speaking to each other right now.
[03:51:33.300 --> 03:51:35.480]  I made the content move!
[03:51:36.460 --> 03:51:37.660]  It was funny!
[03:51:38.220 --> 03:51:39.560]  I saved it!
[03:51:40.020 --> 03:51:41.080]  Steal the thing from Geoff.
[03:51:41.560 --> 03:51:42.180]  Hold on.
[03:51:42.580 --> 03:51:43.560]  Hold on.
[03:51:44.960 --> 03:51:45.400]  Okay.
[03:51:49.880 --> 03:51:50.980]  You put down the star steal.
[03:51:52.080 --> 03:51:53.700]  I could take your double dice and just...
[03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:54.600]  There you go!
[03:51:55.420 --> 03:51:56.960]  That you can't use at this turn.
[03:51:58.760 --> 03:51:59.820]  Yeah, good point.
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:00.820]  Is that true?
[03:52:01.480 --> 03:52:03.020]  You shouldn't have said anything.
[03:52:03.160 --> 03:52:03.880]  It would have fucked him.
[03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:06.600]  No, because he's still using the next turn.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:08.920]  Go, go, go!
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:10.100]  But it did that!
[03:52:12.660 --> 03:52:13.740]  Oh, you got me!
[03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:15.380]  Incredible.
[03:52:16.960 --> 03:52:18.820]  Yeah, I could have just used the dice block I took, right?
[03:52:18.980 --> 03:52:19.180]  Yeah.
[03:52:19.760 --> 03:52:20.660]  I don't think so.
[03:52:22.420 --> 03:52:23.560]  But now we'll never know.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:24.680]  Until the next turn.
[03:52:25.260 --> 03:52:26.200]  When I've used it.
[03:52:29.280 --> 03:52:30.280]  What's at the end of these?
[03:52:32.140 --> 03:52:32.940]  Don't go that way.
[03:52:33.100 --> 03:52:34.040]  If you want boo, go up.
[03:52:35.540 --> 03:52:36.320]  Yeah, I want boo.
[03:52:36.320 --> 03:52:37.620]  I'm not fucking you over, I'm helping you.
[03:52:37.680 --> 03:52:38.080]  Yeah, thanks.
[03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:42.700]  Give me the key.
[03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:51.590]  Five, five, five, one.
[03:52:54.530 --> 03:52:54.930]  Incredible.
[03:52:57.070 --> 03:52:58.730]  This is the door code to get out of the way.
[03:52:58.730 --> 03:53:02.130]  Yeah, when I guessed half the door code is when it went wrong.
[03:53:05.490 --> 03:53:06.350]  Star steal trap.
[03:53:06.350 --> 03:53:06.390]  Star steal trap.
[03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:11.590]  What do you do?
[03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:15.760]  Star steal trap.
[03:53:16.120 --> 03:53:16.520]  Star steal.
[03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:24.820]  But they might have to be returned if he gets a payoff.
[03:53:25.080 --> 03:53:25.100]  Yeah.
[03:53:27.500 --> 03:53:27.960]  Fuck.
[03:53:29.440 --> 03:53:30.060]  What short?
[03:53:30.840 --> 03:53:31.760]  And he leaves.
[03:53:32.420 --> 03:53:34.180]  He's gonna leave in front of my face.
[03:53:35.240 --> 03:53:37.460]  When has he ever paid off for you, though?
[03:53:38.060 --> 03:53:39.560]  This is a star.
[03:53:39.580 --> 03:53:40.260]  You don't need this.
[03:53:40.800 --> 03:53:41.960]  I bet there's a star in there.
[03:53:43.440 --> 03:53:44.480]  He doesn't need that.
[03:53:44.480 --> 03:53:46.720]  I just really wanted to play the minigame with all the doors.
[03:53:48.500 --> 03:53:50.300]  I actually wanted to do that, too.
[03:53:54.560 --> 03:53:55.300]  You peeing?
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:53:55.980]  Oh, yeah.
[03:53:56.640 --> 03:53:57.540]  Pickaxe dash.
[03:54:00.900 --> 03:54:01.660]  Okay, bye.
[03:54:02.880 --> 03:54:03.880]  Happy anniversary.
[03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:05.160]  I'm not leaving!
[03:54:06.460 --> 03:54:07.660]  Happy birthday, bud.
[03:54:09.380 --> 03:54:10.040]  Oh.
[03:54:11.440 --> 03:54:13.480]  Alright, we're jacking it.
[03:54:16.960 --> 03:54:17.960]  I can jack this.
[03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:21.000]  Unravel your wanking arm.
[03:54:26.110 --> 03:54:27.090]  Geoff, you gotta go!
[03:54:28.050 --> 03:54:29.490]  Geoff, please.
[03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.590]  Geoff, please.
[03:54:31.450 --> 03:54:32.150]  I hit back.
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:36.360]  It's all turnt.
[03:54:36.360 --> 03:54:38.540]  I hit the button and it said it was fine.
[03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:39.880]  What happened?
[03:54:42.460 --> 03:54:44.820]  Why do we give you the one that controls the screen?
[03:54:44.820 --> 03:54:45.740]  I don't know!
[03:54:45.900 --> 03:54:48.900]  Geoff has been disconnected because the host has left.
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:50.060]  You have been made host.
[03:54:55.420 --> 03:54:56.940]  Is that whole turn gone?
[03:54:59.540 --> 03:55:00.020]  Geoff.
[03:55:00.080 --> 03:55:00.780]  How do we get it back?
[03:55:01.680 --> 03:55:02.340]  Fix it!
[03:55:02.340 --> 03:55:05.320]  Andrew, he got the sleep menu
[03:55:05.320 --> 03:55:06.840]  and then very slowly
[03:55:06.840 --> 03:55:08.780]  looked at the controller and pressed sleep.
[03:55:08.940 --> 03:55:09.920]  But it said horizontal
[03:55:09.920 --> 03:55:11.360]  and so I hit what it said.
[03:55:11.580 --> 03:55:13.460]  I got it off for one minute!
[03:55:13.900 --> 03:55:14.840]  He turned it off.
[03:55:16.500 --> 03:55:18.140]  He's Troy from fucking
[03:55:18.140 --> 03:55:18.920]  community.
[03:55:19.560 --> 03:55:22.740]  With the fucking pizzas.
[03:55:23.560 --> 03:55:24.440]  I'm going home.
[03:55:25.480 --> 03:55:26.340]  I'm leaving.
[03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:28.100]  I'm leaving.
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:29.840]  I'm leaving.
[03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:36.940]  Everyone hit the button.
[03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:39.060]  Alright, we're in.
[03:55:39.260 --> 03:55:40.280]  You go next.
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:43.060]  I don't know if we have a save point
[03:55:43.060 --> 03:55:44.720]  because of how he exited it.
[03:55:46.380 --> 03:55:47.460]  Hold on, wait.
[03:55:47.560 --> 03:55:48.820]  Did we just replace each other's things?
[03:55:49.260 --> 03:55:50.520]  Okay, I'm Mario now. That's fine.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:52.660]  No, no, no.
[03:55:52.660 --> 03:55:54.100]  You gotta stick with your own joycon.
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:55:55.760]  What?
[03:55:56.660 --> 03:55:57.860]  Whatever you end up with,
[03:55:57.960 --> 03:55:58.920]  you gotta keep your joycon.
[03:56:00.380 --> 03:56:01.220]  Let's see what happens.
[03:56:02.620 --> 03:56:03.260]  Alright, Geoff, you can
[03:56:03.720 --> 03:56:04.140]  advance.
[03:56:05.660 --> 03:56:06.080]  Rejoin.
[03:56:08.180 --> 03:56:09.060]  Seems right, yep.
[03:56:09.540 --> 03:56:09.740]  No.
[03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:15.710]  I have
[03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:17.510]  my laptop closed.
[03:56:18.690 --> 03:56:19.770]  I don't want to open it.
[03:56:20.270 --> 03:56:20.970]  You gotta open it.
[03:56:21.070 --> 03:56:22.490]  There's a lot of idiot flags on it.
[03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:25.830]  Geoff, what the fuck?
[03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:27.110]  It said my thing was sideways
[03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:28.870]  and it said hit this button to go back
[03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:32.130]  and so I did, and it turned off. Nick is there, he saw me do it.
[03:56:32.270 --> 03:56:33.290]  I did see it.
[03:56:33.690 --> 03:56:34.890]  But I put my hand on my head.
[03:56:35.170 --> 03:56:36.910]  I watched it, I held it out, and I went
[03:56:36.910 --> 03:56:38.310]  and I hit it.
[03:56:38.470 --> 03:56:39.830]  But in the menu, it's this way.
[03:56:40.170 --> 03:56:41.910]  But on the thing, it said it was sideways.
[03:56:42.730 --> 03:56:44.610]  In front of us, it said it was sideways.
[03:56:46.490 --> 03:56:47.070]  Nick knows?
[03:56:49.230 --> 03:56:51.690]  Why do they do that? Why do they change the buttons?
[03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:53.350]  Nintendo sucks.
[03:56:54.010 --> 03:56:55.310]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:56:56.410 --> 03:56:57.390]  Andrew, what's it look like for you?
[03:56:57.970 --> 03:56:59.330]  I'm just sitting in the lobby
[03:56:59.330 --> 03:57:00.530]  in the party plaza.
[03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:03.350]  Wait, so you left the game?
[03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.550]  I think
[03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:06.650]  he was kicked from the game.
[03:57:06.750 --> 03:57:07.910]  I thought he became host of the game.
[03:57:08.170 --> 03:57:09.590]  No, I'm waiting to join.
[03:57:11.070 --> 03:57:11.710]  Yeah, so are we.
[03:57:12.210 --> 03:57:13.910]  But there's nothing to join if Andrew left.
[03:57:15.770 --> 03:57:17.310]  So are we just stuck
[03:57:17.310 --> 03:57:18.370]  in a loop of re-entering?
[03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:21.370]  It says I'm
[03:57:21.370 --> 03:57:23.190]  waiting for players, and I'm in the party plaza.
[03:57:24.770 --> 03:57:25.650]  Well, we did, Gavin.
[03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:28.750]  We launched the game?
[03:57:29.270 --> 03:57:31.250]  You might have to go back to the balloon,
[03:57:32.010 --> 03:57:32.970]  set up a new lobby,
[03:57:35.190 --> 03:57:36.390]  or play Mario Kart.
[03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:38.430]  Oh, shit.
[03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:39.490]  Here, you do it.
[03:57:40.570 --> 03:57:42.490]  I mean, I might touch the controller. It's wrong.
[03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:43.270]  Can I be Mole?
[03:57:44.170 --> 03:57:46.750]  No, just get the game back, dumbass.
[03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:47.130]  Okay.
[03:57:49.030 --> 03:57:50.050]  Oh, my God.
[03:57:50.250 --> 03:57:51.550]  Do I have to full-blown
[03:57:52.530 --> 03:57:53.530]  quit the game, do you think?
[03:57:55.170 --> 03:57:56.210]  Don't ask me.
[03:57:56.470 --> 03:57:57.910]  I don't want the responsibility.
[03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:58.710]  Yes, quit the game.
[03:58:00.190 --> 03:58:02.130]  The responsibility, get real.
[03:58:03.450 --> 03:58:04.130]  Hey, you left.
[03:58:04.630 --> 03:58:05.350]  I don't know, man.
[03:58:06.850 --> 03:58:08.690]  Every time something's gone wrong, you've been out of the room.
[03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:10.870]  Yeah, what does that
[03:58:10.870 --> 03:58:12.510]  say about me
[03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:14.690]  and you fucking morons?
[03:58:14.690 --> 03:58:16.730]  This is 100%
[03:58:16.730 --> 03:58:17.470]  on Nintendo.
[03:58:17.810 --> 03:58:19.270]  That is for you.
[03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:21.310]  He's absolutely right.
[03:58:21.630 --> 03:58:22.990]  You keep pressing this.
[03:58:23.470 --> 03:58:26.550]  This is insane.
[03:58:27.250 --> 03:58:28.330]  I agree.
[03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:30.690]  I'm really disappointed in Nintendo right now.
[03:58:30.690 --> 03:58:31.450]  Yeah, I'm really upset.
[03:58:31.770 --> 03:58:32.810]  Nick and I are upset.
[03:58:36.570 --> 03:58:37.930]  Okay, so...
[03:58:39.570 --> 03:58:40.110]  Who...
[03:58:41.650 --> 03:58:42.190]  Well...
[03:58:42.190 --> 03:58:42.910]  So...
[03:58:42.910 --> 03:58:44.210]  Player two was Gavin.
[03:58:45.270 --> 03:58:47.050]  We're just going to trade controllers then.
[03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:49.230]  I don't think we're allowed to do that.
[03:58:49.410 --> 03:58:51.950]  I think Mario will be Gavin.
[03:58:52.270 --> 03:58:54.110]  No, you're a Wario guy.
[03:58:54.490 --> 03:58:55.310]  I'm not.
[03:58:55.450 --> 03:58:56.130]  We don't get along.
[03:59:00.210 --> 03:59:01.870]  I don't like upside-down M's.
[03:59:05.150 --> 03:59:05.630]  Also known
[03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:06.070]  as a W.
[03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.530]  Really,
[03:59:09.530 --> 03:59:11.170]  really disappointed in Nintendo.
[03:59:15.730 --> 03:59:17.090]  Never happens on an Xbox.
[03:59:17.450 --> 03:59:19.550]  Or a Playstation.
[03:59:19.570 --> 03:59:20.970]  The buttons are the buttons.
[03:59:21.190 --> 03:59:23.910]  Doesn't matter how you hold in your controller.
[03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:26.010]  Do you put it in
[03:59:26.010 --> 03:59:27.150]  sleep mode?
[03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.410]  Yeah.
[03:59:35.900 --> 03:59:37.340]  Wait, what's going on?
[03:59:38.180 --> 03:59:39.480]  The purple one, me.
[03:59:40.680 --> 03:59:42.000]  Because I was third, right?
[03:59:42.000 --> 03:59:42.480]  Yes.
[03:59:42.580 --> 03:59:44.440]  So you're Gash?
[03:59:45.680 --> 03:59:46.200]  No.
[03:59:48.180 --> 03:59:48.720]  I'm Gash.
[03:59:51.380 --> 03:59:53.500]  Just pick the fucking monsters.
[03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:55.460]  Hey Andrew, how you doing?
[03:59:55.960 --> 03:59:56.880]  Now what?
[03:59:58.980 --> 03:59:59.840]  Okay, join.
[04:00:02.260 --> 04:00:04.400]  Do I need to change the screen real fast?
[04:00:04.880 --> 04:00:05.400]  Probably.
[04:00:05.580 --> 04:00:06.220]  Okay, hold on.
[04:00:06.980 --> 04:00:08.200]  Hey dickheads, don't join us.
[04:00:08.200 --> 04:00:10.040]  No room to be found.
[04:00:10.400 --> 04:00:10.980]  I need an ID.
[04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:12.720]  Yeah, hang on.
[04:00:14.380 --> 04:00:16.320]  I think if someone in chat makes it in,
[04:00:16.380 --> 04:00:17.120]  they get to play.
[04:00:18.740 --> 04:00:19.980]  Everything you've said
[04:00:19.980 --> 04:00:22.180]  for the last ten minutes has made me so
[04:00:22.180 --> 04:00:24.180]  mad, I don't know what to do.
[04:00:26.760 --> 04:00:27.380]  Are we off?
[04:00:28.140 --> 04:00:29.620]  Happy one year anniversary.
[04:00:32.060 --> 04:00:33.700]  The final day of the company.
[04:00:34.800 --> 04:00:35.960]  Andrew, I'm going to get a Discord
[04:00:35.960 --> 04:00:37.040]  and tell you to leave.
[04:00:38.320 --> 04:00:39.940]  You guys are ridiculous.
[04:00:40.240 --> 04:00:40.640]  Hit send.
[04:00:41.680 --> 04:00:42.700]  Alright, send info.
[04:00:42.980 --> 04:00:44.680]  No, hit the button for room info.
[04:00:48.940 --> 04:00:50.320]  Okay, I just put it in Slack.
[04:00:50.400 --> 04:00:50.520]  Thank you.
[04:00:50.920 --> 04:00:52.340]  I'm sorry, Discord.
[04:00:53.660 --> 04:00:55.160]  Oh god, my knees.
[04:00:55.820 --> 04:00:56.440]  It's tea?
[04:01:08.640 --> 04:01:09.540]  Same passcode
[04:01:09.540 --> 04:01:10.400]  that we had before too.
[04:01:10.900 --> 04:01:11.500]  He's back.
[04:01:12.720 --> 04:01:14.180]  To the balloon.
[04:01:15.560 --> 04:01:16.980]  Alright, what state is this game in?
[04:01:18.660 --> 04:01:19.820]  I'm so worried.
[04:01:25.140 --> 04:01:26.420]  Okay, okay.
[04:01:27.420 --> 04:01:29.320]  Real early sigh of relief,
[04:01:29.460 --> 04:01:30.140]  but okay, let's see.
[04:01:32.340 --> 04:01:33.600]  That's four ready people.
[04:01:35.200 --> 04:01:36.260]  Turn 28.
[04:01:36.260 --> 04:01:36.700]  Okay.
[04:01:39.980 --> 04:01:41.420]  Geoff lost his stuff.
[04:01:46.560 --> 04:01:48.200]  I'm going to be Dilcom.
[04:01:52.300 --> 04:01:55.940]  What, we could have swapped back?
[04:01:56.060 --> 04:01:56.300]  Yeah.
[04:01:56.940 --> 04:01:57.920]  Then you would have been Gash.
[04:02:00.000 --> 04:02:01.000]  Why'd you guys do it that way?
[04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:03.480]  Oh, we could get another shot at Luigi.
[04:02:04.340 --> 04:02:05.400]  Oh, okay.
[04:02:05.480 --> 04:02:06.880]  Well, let's see what...
[04:02:06.880 --> 04:02:09.320]  If I move this...
[04:02:09.320 --> 04:02:11.240]  Zoe Fell said, well, that's lucky for Geoff.
[04:02:13.060 --> 04:02:15.080]  I mean, it worked out okay for me,
[04:02:15.140 --> 04:02:16.360]  but it was rough getting there.
[04:02:16.400 --> 04:02:17.820]  What it really is, is lucky for Nintendo.
[04:02:18.280 --> 04:02:20.360]  Yeah, lucky that I would have sent an email.
[04:02:20.720 --> 04:02:22.660]  When so much of our livelihood depends on
[04:02:23.080 --> 04:02:24.360]  Mario Party Jamboree,
[04:02:25.280 --> 04:02:27.200]  it's pretty mind-blowing we can't get through
[04:02:27.200 --> 04:02:28.400]  a whole game without quitting it.
[04:02:29.800 --> 04:02:31.400]  That is true, it's happened both times.
[04:02:31.400 --> 04:02:32.320]  We've done 30 turns.
[04:02:33.520 --> 04:02:34.960]  And even the times before that,
[04:02:35.020 --> 04:02:36.440]  when we just did on stream for shits and giggles.
[04:02:36.720 --> 04:02:37.980]  I think it was even the same minigame.
[04:02:41.440 --> 04:02:42.460]  The digging one?
[04:02:42.540 --> 04:02:43.820]  I think it was the digging one, both times.
[04:02:43.820 --> 04:02:45.540]  It's like a game quitter.
[04:02:47.560 --> 04:02:49.520]  You can't hold this tiny controller
[04:02:49.520 --> 04:02:51.600]  in your hand and not touch every other button.
[04:02:51.640 --> 04:02:52.400]  It's a piece of shit.
[04:02:52.540 --> 04:02:54.560]  It's a piece of shit, thank you, Nick.
[04:02:55.760 --> 04:02:57.240]  What a piece of shit.
[04:02:58.740 --> 04:02:59.380]  Oh!
[04:02:59.960 --> 04:03:00.600]  Yeah!
[04:03:01.360 --> 04:03:02.720]  This is a much better turn.
[04:03:03.220 --> 04:03:05.420]  That's way better than another star.
[04:03:05.940 --> 04:03:07.180]  It's just a fanfic.
[04:03:08.540 --> 04:03:09.400]  What a
[04:03:09.400 --> 04:03:10.880]  piece of shit. And
[04:03:10.880 --> 04:03:12.740]  now you have the opportunity to
[04:03:12.740 --> 04:03:14.460]  fix your mistake.
[04:03:15.140 --> 04:03:17.020]  Oh, Nick!
[04:03:17.460 --> 04:03:19.500]  You keep failing at comedy.
[04:03:20.840 --> 04:03:21.420]  Nick keeps
[04:03:21.420 --> 04:03:22.640]  failing the comedy check.
[04:03:22.880 --> 04:03:25.240]  That was the most expected move.
[04:03:27.240 --> 04:03:29.080]  And I can't be mad, I already did the
[04:03:29.080 --> 04:03:30.640]  mad comedy thing, so...
[04:03:30.640 --> 04:03:33.080]  Do you guys think Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be
[04:03:33.080 --> 04:03:34.060]  Geoff-proof? No.
[04:03:34.480 --> 04:03:36.380]  I don't think they're anybody-proof.
[04:03:37.000 --> 04:03:38.260]  They're no-one-proof.
[04:03:39.300 --> 04:03:41.000]  They're dog shit.
[04:03:41.080 --> 04:03:41.800]  They're fucking dumb.
[04:03:43.140 --> 04:03:44.560]  It's such a dumb mechanic.
[04:03:44.580 --> 04:03:46.380]  31-turn Mario part.
[04:03:46.700 --> 04:03:49.120]  Pretty good. That's what we'll call
[04:03:49.120 --> 04:03:51.300]  the VOD. Well, that's what the last one was,
[04:03:51.320 --> 04:03:51.480]  right?
[04:03:52.700 --> 04:03:55.040]  Do I want to change my
[04:03:55.040 --> 04:03:56.420]  mind from last time?
[04:03:57.740 --> 04:03:58.620]  Yes. Yeah.
[04:03:58.980 --> 04:04:00.780]  I would've gotten the stars.
[04:04:00.960 --> 04:04:02.880]  But now, I can slow everybody down.
[04:04:03.680 --> 04:04:05.120]  I'm definitely turning this game off
[04:04:05.120 --> 04:04:05.740]  again on accident.
[04:04:07.660 --> 04:04:09.400]  Please don't. If that happens,
[04:04:09.560 --> 04:04:11.180]  I'm leaving. I'm just putting the controller down
[04:04:11.180 --> 04:04:12.800]  next time, and Gavin can then fuck it.
[04:04:13.040 --> 04:04:15.000]  Because I can't trust what it tells
[04:04:15.000 --> 04:04:17.140]  me to do on screen is not what it wants me to do.
[04:04:17.560 --> 04:04:18.580]  I mean, it was
[04:04:18.580 --> 04:04:19.960]  a real motherfucker.
[04:04:21.360 --> 04:04:23.060]  It looked like it was in
[04:04:23.060 --> 04:04:25.080]  the horizontal. It said it was!
[04:04:25.280 --> 04:04:27.100]  Yeah! Nick can rewind
[04:04:27.100 --> 04:04:29.000]  it and show you later. I hope I'm right.
[04:04:29.640 --> 04:04:31.000]  You are. Nick, you don't have anything
[04:04:31.000 --> 04:04:32.740]  I want to steal this time. Yeah, it's true.
[04:04:32.820 --> 04:04:34.640]  Oh no! What will you do?
[04:04:35.820 --> 04:04:37.360]  Just throw this down, I guess.
[04:04:37.620 --> 04:04:38.820]  Oh yeah? Same spot? Yeah.
[04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:45.190]  Yeah.
[04:04:47.450 --> 04:04:47.850]  Yep!
[04:04:50.410 --> 04:04:51.370]  No more P-breaks
[04:04:51.370 --> 04:04:53.450]  the rest of the string. Oh, I really need one
[04:04:53.450 --> 04:04:54.130]  then. No more digging.
[04:05:02.810 --> 04:05:03.190]  Oh.
[04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:06.630]  Oh, I don't get to get the...
[04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:08.750]  You get shot,
[04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:10.330]  but it's alright. Where do I get shot to?
[04:05:10.750 --> 04:05:12.510]  You just lose some coins.
[04:05:13.050 --> 04:05:13.110]  Yeah.
[04:05:16.390 --> 04:05:17.710]  And they get blown to pieces.
[04:05:19.570 --> 04:05:20.470]  No way!
[04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:22.150]  Nice.
[04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:24.310]  Hey, come on, Luigi.
[04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.750]  Alright, where
[04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:27.150]  were we?
[04:05:29.770 --> 04:05:30.730]  Same fucking
[04:05:30.730 --> 04:05:32.830]  number! The exact same!
[04:05:33.250 --> 04:05:34.810]  Everyone else improved but
[04:05:34.810 --> 04:05:35.110]  me.
[04:05:36.650 --> 04:05:37.050]  Ugh.
[04:05:39.270 --> 04:05:40.790]  I think Gavin got double-diced
[04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:42.710]  last time, didn't he? No, you did,
[04:05:42.770 --> 04:05:45.050]  didn't you? I thought you got it after you landed on the
[04:05:45.050 --> 04:05:46.870]  item space or something. Oh, you're
[04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:47.990]  probably right. I don't remember.
[04:05:49.230 --> 04:05:50.650]  There was a lot of stress a minute ago.
[04:05:52.090 --> 04:05:52.890]  Uh, ClutchMyPearls
[04:05:52.890 --> 04:05:54.830]  in the chat, thank you. Hey, what's up
[04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:56.850]  ClutchMyPearls? Hey! You just missed a really cool moment
[04:05:56.850 --> 04:05:58.790]  where I saved the game. Yeah, it was really awesome.
[04:05:58.790 --> 04:06:00.750]  It was really cool. The stream was
[04:06:00.750 --> 04:06:02.590]  getting boring and I fixed it. Yeah, cool.
[04:06:03.150 --> 04:06:04.570]  Geoff turned on the commentary. Wait, I fixed it by
[04:06:04.570 --> 04:06:06.570]  following directions. Didn't that happen last time?
[04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:07.850]  Yeah, but he only got five this time.
[04:06:08.590 --> 04:06:10.570]  He got twelve last time. Is that
[04:06:10.570 --> 04:06:11.370]  predetermined?
[04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.990]  Seems suspicious.
[04:06:15.650 --> 04:06:16.390]  Wait a minute.
[04:06:18.690 --> 04:06:20.090]  We're not digging at all.
[04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:21.670]  Oh, cage catch.
[04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.870]  Oh.
[04:06:24.730 --> 04:06:25.950]  Avoid the crane!
[04:06:28.230 --> 04:06:28.790]  Oh.
[04:06:29.570 --> 04:06:30.130]  Oh.
[04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:31.910]  This isn't what I thought it was.
[04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:34.730]  Holy shit!
[04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.730]  Okay.
[04:06:36.610 --> 04:06:37.130]  Alright.
[04:06:39.570 --> 04:06:40.650]  Alright, let's get this little
[04:06:40.650 --> 04:06:41.830]  motherfucker. Please don't.
[04:06:46.340 --> 04:06:46.620]  Go!
[04:06:51.640 --> 04:06:53.280]  And we caught a fish.
[04:06:53.340 --> 04:06:54.060]  Goddamn fish.
[04:06:54.200 --> 04:06:56.380]  And we're eating tonight.
[04:06:56.380 --> 04:06:57.900]  Hell yeah. Fish!
[04:06:58.000 --> 04:06:59.820]  I just wanted to get us the save for the next turn.
[04:07:03.540 --> 04:07:03.940]  Alright.
[04:07:04.440 --> 04:07:04.640]  Alright.
[04:07:07.860 --> 04:07:08.540]  Andrew has more
[04:07:08.540 --> 04:07:09.240]  money than God.
[04:07:12.660 --> 04:07:13.560]  Bye, Luigi!
[04:07:14.460 --> 04:07:16.200]  Wait, he's still... oh. Bye.
[04:07:17.580 --> 04:07:18.500]  Did we ever see
[04:07:18.500 --> 04:07:20.040]  him leave last time? No.
[04:07:20.720 --> 04:07:21.780]  We didn't make it that far.
[04:07:22.680 --> 04:07:23.560]  We got to the game.
[04:07:25.460 --> 04:07:26.020]  Do it.
[04:07:29.100 --> 04:07:29.740]  Good lord.
[04:07:29.920 --> 04:07:30.480]  That is hell.
[04:07:30.580 --> 04:07:32.080]  Just move it. Just move the star. It's funny.
[04:07:33.280 --> 04:07:34.740]  And if it's not there...
[04:07:34.740 --> 04:07:35.000]  Uh-huh.
[04:07:37.320 --> 04:07:37.980]  Then there's just houses.
[04:07:37.980 --> 04:07:40.860]  And if you want to chance at it, you're going to have to move it.
[04:07:40.940 --> 04:07:41.820]  Unless you roll two tens.
[04:07:43.600 --> 04:07:44.280]  I shall not.
[04:07:45.100 --> 04:07:46.060]  I just like the way he looks
[04:07:46.060 --> 04:07:47.360]  when he blows the whistle. It's funny.
[04:07:48.540 --> 04:07:49.340]  Like a little badass.
[04:07:49.660 --> 04:07:50.560]  Yeah, he's a cool little guy.
[04:07:50.560 --> 04:07:50.600]  Oh.
[04:07:52.060 --> 04:07:52.700]  Wow.
[04:07:53.920 --> 04:07:56.000]  No, it's the other way!
[04:07:56.540 --> 04:07:57.980]  Don't give it to DK!
[04:07:58.940 --> 04:07:59.600]  Oh, no.
[04:07:59.800 --> 04:08:00.980]  This is some bullshit!
[04:08:03.480 --> 04:08:04.540]  It's coming up
[04:08:04.540 --> 04:08:06.380]  due! Finally!
[04:08:07.460 --> 04:08:08.380]  I wonder if
[04:08:09.100 --> 04:08:10.460]  I lost progress
[04:08:10.460 --> 04:08:11.420]  with some of my reactions.
[04:08:15.300 --> 04:08:16.200]  Uh-oh.
[04:08:17.180 --> 04:08:17.820]  Motherfucker.
[04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:22.590]  How about
[04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:24.790]  receive a hundred stars?
[04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:27.410]  Oh, you're close.
[04:08:30.110 --> 04:08:31.250]  What can we do to
[04:08:31.250 --> 04:08:32.330]  screw over Duncan?
[04:08:33.650 --> 04:08:35.010]  Just let me play.
[04:08:36.210 --> 04:08:37.310]  Just clear the field.
[04:08:37.430 --> 04:08:39.010]  Let me play. I got it.
[04:08:39.090 --> 04:08:39.930]  You can put it in sleep mode.
[04:08:40.850 --> 04:08:41.350]  That's true.
[04:08:41.770 --> 04:08:43.470]  I think that got us in this position.
[04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:48.070]  Use the creep block
[04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.470]  or whatever.
[04:08:49.850 --> 04:08:51.930]  Gavin can get close to the boo.
[04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:57.630]  I'm going to save it for the last turn.
[04:08:59.690 --> 04:09:00.350]  Actually, hold on.
[04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.690]  I'm thinking!
[04:09:01.810 --> 04:09:02.830]  Hold on! I'm thinking!
[04:09:04.030 --> 04:09:05.110]  He's one away. It doesn't matter.
[04:09:06.390 --> 04:09:07.810]  I was going to use it, but
[04:09:07.810 --> 04:09:09.350]  if he rolls a one, he gets it.
[04:09:12.270 --> 04:09:13.490]  That's your favorite spot.
[04:09:14.490 --> 04:09:14.690]  Yeah.
[04:09:15.730 --> 04:09:16.650]  Nice objective
[04:09:16.650 --> 04:09:17.290]  landed there.
[04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:19.710]  I didn't.
[04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:21.270]  You sure didn't.
[04:09:22.050 --> 04:09:23.030]  Coming back, Geoff.
[04:09:24.470 --> 04:09:25.470]  Maybe this time.
[04:09:30.980 --> 04:09:31.800]  Bowser by the way.
[04:09:33.360 --> 04:09:34.480]  You know what you have to do.
[04:09:34.780 --> 04:09:36.780]  Do I know what to do?
[04:09:37.260 --> 04:09:38.260]  You gotta get to
[04:09:39.280 --> 04:09:39.780]  boo.
[04:09:42.420 --> 04:09:44.440]  I thought you meant do something with the item.
[04:09:45.120 --> 04:09:45.980]  Boo, fool!
[04:09:45.980 --> 04:09:47.920]  And steal it from Andrew.
[04:09:48.100 --> 04:09:49.040]  He's about to buy another one.
[04:09:49.680 --> 04:09:52.460]  Still just really disappointed in Nintendo.
[04:09:52.760 --> 04:09:53.160]  Crazy.
[04:09:53.500 --> 04:09:53.920]  I am too.
[04:09:56.240 --> 04:09:57.040]  Don't do it.
[04:09:57.500 --> 04:09:58.220]  You don't want it.
[04:09:59.980 --> 04:10:01.160]  See, that's funny.
[04:10:01.560 --> 04:10:02.480]  And it worked out.
[04:10:03.400 --> 04:10:04.280]  I'm laughing.
[04:10:07.080 --> 04:10:08.060]  That's really funny.
[04:10:10.760 --> 04:10:11.400]  That's funny.
[04:10:11.640 --> 04:10:12.340]  That's funny.
[04:10:12.340 --> 04:10:16.160]  I bet you can't use it till next turn after my last turn.
[04:10:18.620 --> 04:10:19.820]  It won't be for you.
[04:10:20.960 --> 04:10:21.800]  It's gonna be for everybody.
[04:10:21.920 --> 04:10:22.320]  It's super creepy.
[04:10:22.880 --> 04:10:23.280]  Oh.
[04:10:26.500 --> 04:10:27.240]  Get there!
[04:10:28.080 --> 04:10:29.240]  You didn't even get to...
[04:10:29.240 --> 04:10:31.700]  I should have just used them, you worthless...
[04:10:31.700 --> 04:10:32.500]  What are you doing?
[04:10:33.820 --> 04:10:34.220]  Gavin!
[04:10:35.860 --> 04:10:37.340]  I got one more turn, haven't I?
[04:10:37.360 --> 04:10:37.700]  Great!
[04:10:38.140 --> 04:10:39.300]  What are you...
[04:10:39.780 --> 04:10:40.480]  Big roll.
[04:10:42.940 --> 04:10:44.280]  Oh, come on!
[04:10:45.920 --> 04:10:47.380]  Just one time.
[04:10:47.980 --> 04:10:48.980]  I hope you have enough money.
[04:10:49.060 --> 04:10:49.740]  No, you do.
[04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:53.880]  Just once.
[04:10:54.200 --> 04:10:55.520]  You just had to have it, didn't you?
[04:10:57.900 --> 04:10:59.280]  You gave that to Andrew.
[04:11:03.300 --> 04:11:04.140]  Where's the next one?
[04:11:04.160 --> 04:11:06.780]  You better roll more than a two on this next turn.
[04:11:07.520 --> 04:11:09.000]  Oh, it's back there.
[04:11:09.440 --> 04:11:10.900]  So I hit random after that?
[04:11:11.600 --> 04:11:12.840]  Wait, where am I in reference to that?
[04:11:13.040 --> 04:11:13.600]  Very far.
[04:11:17.380 --> 04:11:17.860]  Cool.
[04:11:21.440 --> 04:11:23.100]  Hey Andrew, land on a chance time.
[04:11:26.180 --> 04:11:27.340]  Content move at the end.
[04:11:31.730 --> 04:11:32.210]  3v1.
[04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:34.210]  Alright.
[04:11:34.210 --> 04:11:34.370]  Alright.
[04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:38.150]  Oh, I think this is the green game.
[04:11:40.670 --> 04:11:41.950]  Blame it on the crane.
[04:11:48.970 --> 04:11:49.850]  We know what to do.
[04:11:55.330 --> 04:11:56.510]  I just got a slack from Eric.
[04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:58.290]  What are you talking about, Eric?
[04:11:59.190 --> 04:12:00.950]  I wrote the meta for this.
[04:12:01.530 --> 04:12:02.910]  So I wouldn't have to do it later.
[04:12:05.310 --> 04:12:06.970]  31 turn Mario Party.
[04:12:15.730 --> 04:12:18.650]  If all I had to do was touch you, I'd be fucking killing you.
[04:12:19.810 --> 04:12:20.930]  Go, go, go, go!
[04:12:21.250 --> 04:12:22.330]  It's a long game, though.
[04:12:24.890 --> 04:12:25.770]  Oh, wow!
[04:12:27.650 --> 04:12:28.090]  Wow!
[04:12:29.430 --> 04:12:30.310]  Go, go, go!
[04:12:30.890 --> 04:12:31.530]  Damn it.
[04:12:32.270 --> 04:12:34.890]  Get out of the way, you little shy guy bastards!
[04:12:35.230 --> 04:12:36.350]  What did you call them?
[04:12:36.430 --> 04:12:37.130]  Shy guy bastards.
[04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:41.150]  0.0.
[04:12:41.170 --> 04:12:42.490]  You got Dil!
[04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:45.470]  Take a star from him.
[04:12:47.610 --> 04:12:49.310]  Are we about to play the last turn?
[04:12:49.590 --> 04:12:50.610]  The final turn!
[04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:52.630]  The 31st turn.
[04:13:06.340 --> 04:13:07.460]  Final turn.
[04:13:15.260 --> 04:13:17.200]  This is your last hurrah, buddy.
[04:13:17.420 --> 04:13:18.880]  Make it a good one.
[04:13:24.900 --> 04:13:25.740]  What's it say?
[04:13:27.540 --> 04:13:29.540]  It's the clip of you turning it off,
[04:13:29.760 --> 04:13:31.060]  and somebody leaving a comment
[04:13:31.060 --> 04:13:31.400]  that says,
[04:13:31.680 --> 04:13:33.220]  how could Nintendo do this?
[04:13:36.540 --> 04:13:37.420]  Audience knows.
[04:13:38.980 --> 04:13:39.800]  Oh, yes.
[04:13:40.660 --> 04:13:41.700]  Bowser shuffled.
[04:13:41.700 --> 04:13:42.720]  Uh-oh. Wait.
[04:13:44.220 --> 04:13:45.980]  Is he going to move us?
[04:13:46.320 --> 04:13:46.680]  I don't know.
[04:13:46.900 --> 04:13:47.920]  I'm not going to get to Boo!
[04:13:48.960 --> 04:13:49.920]  Send me!
[04:13:51.640 --> 04:13:52.200]  No!
[04:13:54.060 --> 04:13:55.340]  Send me to Boo!
[04:13:55.640 --> 04:13:56.780]  I was right there!
[04:13:57.320 --> 04:13:59.080]  You scumbag!
[04:13:59.220 --> 04:14:01.280]  Oh, it's Geoff. Geoff can't afford it!
[04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:09.050]  That was pretty cool.
[04:14:09.490 --> 04:14:10.030]  That...
[04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:12.370]  That blue balls
[04:14:12.370 --> 04:14:14.390]  the shit out of me!
[04:14:14.890 --> 04:14:15.410]  Where can I even go?
[04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:17.030]  Where can I even go?
[04:14:17.970 --> 04:14:19.510]  I don't know where to go!
[04:14:19.570 --> 04:14:22.090]  My testicles are solid blue.
[04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:31.170]  I can't believe it.
[04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:34.590]  Oh, jeez.
[04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:35.430]  Sweet.
[04:14:38.230 --> 04:14:39.650]  That is awful.
[04:14:40.450 --> 04:14:41.810]  You were so close!
[04:14:42.390 --> 04:14:44.470]  Imagine if you rolled more than three last time.
[04:14:44.770 --> 04:14:46.450]  Well, I don't think that was down to me, Nick!
[04:14:46.490 --> 04:14:47.330]  I think it was this chip!
[04:14:48.310 --> 04:14:48.790]  No!
[04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:50.270]  Yes!
[04:14:50.590 --> 04:14:51.810]  Oh my god, this is turned out.
[04:14:53.230 --> 04:14:53.710]  Yes!
[04:14:54.410 --> 04:14:55.770]  This is insane.
[04:14:57.050 --> 04:14:58.730]  This last turn...
[04:14:58.730 --> 04:15:00.690]  I hope that was my star that went to Gavin.
[04:15:00.850 --> 04:15:02.310]  I don't want Nick to keep it.
[04:15:02.390 --> 04:15:07.570]  Everything that went wrong happened after the fucking Nintendo system fucked up!
[04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:09.030]  In my extension, Geoff!
[04:15:09.450 --> 04:15:10.690]  Nah, it was the Nintendo system.
[04:15:11.230 --> 04:15:13.090]  Testing Nintendo system!
[04:15:14.850 --> 04:15:16.210]  Stupid Nintendo system.
[04:15:20.890 --> 04:15:22.570]  I'll use an item, I guess.
[04:15:22.650 --> 04:15:22.850]  Great!
[04:15:25.190 --> 04:15:26.090]  Oh no.
[04:15:26.810 --> 04:15:28.730]  I'm the only one impacted by the full dice.
[04:15:29.530 --> 04:15:31.250]  And you've got a dice to get rid of it?
[04:15:31.710 --> 04:15:31.850]  Yep.
[04:15:33.270 --> 04:15:34.830]  Okay, let's see what happens.
[04:15:36.790 --> 04:15:37.730]  Roll a 25.
[04:15:38.450 --> 04:15:39.630]  Ooh, a lovely 8.
[04:15:40.250 --> 04:15:42.110]  How did I look away for a little bit?
[04:15:42.210 --> 04:15:44.430]  Andrew has six stars and 430 points.
[04:15:44.430 --> 04:15:46.110]  Are you shitting me?!
[04:15:46.110 --> 04:15:47.270]  That's funny.
[04:15:47.310 --> 04:15:50.670]  You wound up in the one safe spot on the whole square!
[04:15:51.490 --> 04:15:52.850]  Well, two.
[04:15:54.790 --> 04:15:55.570]  What are you going to land on?
[04:15:57.550 --> 04:15:58.350]  Give me this.
[04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:01.790]  Oh, it cancels it.
[04:16:02.650 --> 04:16:03.490]  Yeah, that's it.
[04:16:04.430 --> 04:16:05.870]  Well, now he gets to use it.
[04:16:06.350 --> 04:16:07.370]  Oh, damn.
[04:16:09.430 --> 04:16:11.510]  I can't believe it ended this way.
[04:16:11.950 --> 04:16:12.850]  It was an unfortunate ending.
[04:16:14.790 --> 04:16:16.350]  There's a hype train going right now.
[04:16:16.530 --> 04:16:18.470]  This is an insane way to cap this off.
[04:16:18.470 --> 04:16:19.870]  Oh, my words. Thank you very much.
[04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:21.190]  If it gets to 30, I'll take a shit.
[04:16:24.930 --> 04:16:26.790]  If it gets to 30, Geoff will leave his mic in there
[04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:27.510]  while he does a poo.
[04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:29.070]  No.
[04:16:30.130 --> 04:16:30.390]  No?
[04:16:32.150 --> 04:16:33.390]  Don't wear it while you take a shit.
[04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:35.150]  Put it on Andrew.
[04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:38.770]  But close the door so he has to find a way out.
[04:16:38.790 --> 04:16:40.430]  And if Andrew wants to take the audience in there,
[04:16:40.470 --> 04:16:40.790]  then he can.
[04:16:44.150 --> 04:16:45.550]  Thanks to everybody who donated today.
[04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:47.150]  Thank you so much.
[04:16:47.430 --> 04:16:49.210]  It's been crazy. It's been crazy all day.
[04:16:49.310 --> 04:16:50.770]  We really appreciate you coming through.
[04:16:51.210 --> 04:16:52.730]  And just thanks for hanging out.
[04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:55.750]  Watching the stream, understanding that Nintendo
[04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:57.030]  is at fault here and not Geoff.
[04:16:58.030 --> 04:17:00.250]  Supporting us with your eyes and your ears
[04:17:00.250 --> 04:17:01.010]  over the last year.
[04:17:01.170 --> 04:17:03.330]  I couldn't be more excited to do another year
[04:17:03.330 --> 04:17:05.310]  of this and hopefully even more stuff.
[04:17:05.570 --> 04:17:07.410]  Well, we have to justify the office.
[04:17:08.150 --> 04:17:09.730]  And we also have a lease.
[04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:11.830]  So we are required to do one more year.
[04:17:12.410 --> 04:17:12.790]  All right.
[04:17:13.690 --> 04:17:14.690]  Last mini game.
[04:17:14.810 --> 04:17:15.550]  Here we go.
[04:17:16.390 --> 04:17:17.310]  Here we go.
[04:17:19.170 --> 04:17:21.310]  You know what I think I'm most excited about
[04:17:21.310 --> 04:17:22.070]  over the next year?
[04:17:22.310 --> 04:17:24.890]  Is not having to get on camera and remind
[04:17:24.890 --> 04:17:26.870]  myself not to spoil that we have an office
[04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:28.790]  over and over and over again in my head.
[04:17:28.830 --> 04:17:29.430]  You did great.
[04:17:29.490 --> 04:17:32.350]  Because we've recorded like 30 hours of content
[04:17:32.350 --> 04:17:33.050]  since we got an office.
[04:17:33.130 --> 04:17:35.070]  What is this?
[04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:36.310]  You guys have done this one, right?
[04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:36.670]  No.
[04:17:37.850 --> 04:17:39.210]  You got to take the picture.
[04:17:39.390 --> 04:17:40.730]  But zoom is really walk.
[04:17:40.850 --> 04:17:41.670]  It's very confusing.
[04:17:44.310 --> 04:17:45.470]  All right.
[04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:48.130]  Let's do it.
[04:17:48.350 --> 04:17:50.350]  It's about framing and timing.
[04:17:50.930 --> 04:17:51.650]  The lolly.
[04:17:51.850 --> 04:17:54.390]  Are you guys camera guys?
[04:17:54.730 --> 04:17:54.970]  Yeah.
[04:17:55.390 --> 04:17:58.090]  Where is this?
[04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:59.770]  Where is this brick?
[04:18:00.190 --> 04:18:00.870]  How do I zoom?
[04:18:02.850 --> 04:18:03.670]  Press Y.
[04:18:08.140 --> 04:18:08.740]  Oops.
[04:18:09.120 --> 04:18:09.300]  Shit.
[04:18:09.660 --> 04:18:11.500]  I think I did it well earlier.
[04:18:13.240 --> 04:18:13.840]  Balls.
[04:18:14.620 --> 04:18:15.220]  Chef.
[04:18:16.720 --> 04:18:18.240]  I'm just going to go home.
[04:18:19.280 --> 04:18:20.980]  I'm going to go home.
[04:18:21.060 --> 04:18:21.380]  Maybe not.
[04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:27.410]  I didn't pay attention to the ledge there.
[04:18:28.610 --> 04:18:29.730]  Plus zero.
[04:18:32.270 --> 04:18:32.670]  Okay.
[04:18:34.170 --> 04:18:35.610]  Oh my morgues.
[04:18:36.650 --> 04:18:37.830]  A shippy.
[04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:39.570]  Foul away.
[04:18:40.730 --> 04:18:41.990]  Everyone is showing up right now.
[04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.710]  Thank you so much.
[04:18:43.230 --> 04:18:44.090]  Thanks to my morgues.
[04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:45.990]  Absolute regular.
[04:18:46.290 --> 04:18:47.010]  Oh shit.
[04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:51.710]  I prematurely went.
[04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:54.130]  Geoff's got that one.
[04:18:54.890 --> 04:18:55.390]  Wow.
[04:18:59.190 --> 04:19:01.650]  Caboose 3, 2, 4.
[04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:03.330]  And Schindler's Fist.
[04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.850]  Damn.
[04:19:04.430 --> 04:19:06.090]  Where are these little bastards?
[04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:07.310]  Is that this one?
[04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.410]  Oops.
[04:19:08.650 --> 04:19:11.950]  I keep popping off.
[04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:20.930]  There you go.
[04:19:21.210 --> 04:19:23.290]  I think I was at the wrong one entirely.
[04:19:23.450 --> 04:19:24.830]  I wasn't even at the right chain shot.
[04:19:24.930 --> 04:19:25.110]  Nope.
[04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:29.110]  Ryan 84, the rye guy.
[04:19:29.350 --> 04:19:31.010]  Oh my god.
[04:19:31.010 --> 04:19:31.610]  50.
[04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:32.710]  Thank you.
[04:19:34.430 --> 04:19:35.630]  Are you guys ready?
[04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:37.330]  This is it.
[04:19:37.730 --> 04:19:39.310]  This is what we've all been waiting for.
[04:19:40.530 --> 04:19:41.890]  Should we turn it off though?
[04:19:43.310 --> 04:19:45.510]  We'll just leave it to you and it might just happen.
[04:19:47.350 --> 04:19:48.210]  Oh, Nintendo really.
[04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:51.050]  How can Nintendo do this?
[04:19:51.090 --> 04:19:52.290]  Let's watch the timeline.
[04:19:53.810 --> 04:19:55.910]  I remember when I had four stars for a long time.
[04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:57.030]  Oh, I had more stars than anyone.
[04:19:57.230 --> 04:19:57.650]  Never mind.
[04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:59.370]  Marauder Frog, 20 gifted.
[04:19:59.870 --> 04:20:00.530]  Thank you.
[04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:02.350]  20 gifted, wild.
[04:20:02.470 --> 04:20:03.310]  Thank you so much.
[04:20:03.390 --> 04:20:04.370]  It's crazy right now.
[04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:13.930]  Hey, do you think you're going to get the reaction, sir?
[04:20:14.110 --> 04:20:15.250]  I hope so.
[04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:16.410]  If they throw it out.
[04:20:17.930 --> 04:20:19.210]  Thank you, James.
[04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:20.230]  Appreciate you, man.
[04:20:21.730 --> 04:20:23.570]  Yeah, the dill!
[04:20:23.890 --> 04:20:25.450]  Well, the game is definitely over.
[04:20:25.450 --> 04:20:27.890]  Wow. Well done, dill family.
[04:20:27.890 --> 04:20:28.350]  Thank you.
[04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:32.110]  You'd have to get three stars because he also has like 300 coins.
[04:20:32.350 --> 04:20:32.750]  It's true.
[04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:34.830]  Reaction. Reaction.
[04:20:35.730 --> 04:20:36.250]  Slowpoke.
[04:20:36.410 --> 04:20:37.030]  Oh, this could be me.
[04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:41.070]  Oh! What?
[04:20:41.250 --> 04:20:42.270]  What a coincidence.
[04:20:43.270 --> 04:20:43.790]  What?
[04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:45.990]  Crucified Donkey, 10 more gifted.
[04:20:46.490 --> 04:20:47.970]  This is a celebration for dill.
[04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:49.710]  Hell yeah, it is. Thank you.
[04:20:50.250 --> 04:20:51.590]  It's a donation for dill.
[04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:52.370]  It's a dill-a-bration.
[04:20:53.190 --> 04:20:55.410]  Okay, I think it's going to be Nick.
[04:20:55.850 --> 04:20:57.330]  Oh, that just might be a little bit more.
[04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:58.110]  Dill!
[04:20:58.310 --> 04:21:00.050]  And total dill-a-nation!
[04:21:01.890 --> 04:21:03.670]  I remember old Mario games,
[04:21:03.850 --> 04:21:05.130]  they used to matter
[04:21:05.130 --> 04:21:06.870]  when you had those other stars.
[04:21:07.010 --> 04:21:09.410]  What? Dill was in charge of
[04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:10.470]  every bonus.
[04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:12.830]  He knew he had each one.
[04:21:13.050 --> 04:21:14.730]  He was smug before each one was read out.
[04:21:14.810 --> 04:21:15.350]  Who's going to get it?
[04:21:17.350 --> 04:21:18.890]  Whoa, look at the chart!
[04:21:20.270 --> 04:21:21.290]  Great chart.
[04:21:21.430 --> 04:21:22.990]  How many stars is that?
[04:21:23.070 --> 04:21:24.910]  Like 10? It's a dill sweep.
[04:21:25.090 --> 04:21:27.050]  It's at 9, I think. That's a strong start
[04:21:27.050 --> 04:21:28.290]  to year 2 for Dillcom.
[04:21:28.370 --> 04:21:30.910]  Nothing but down from here.
[04:21:32.190 --> 04:21:33.470]  ZrCatNoir, thank you.
[04:21:33.550 --> 04:21:33.730]  Good lord.
[04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:36.110]  Another second place star.
[04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:38.930]  An insane ending. What a way
[04:21:38.930 --> 04:21:39.630]  to go out.
[04:21:40.210 --> 04:21:42.490]  What a way to cap off year 1.
[04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:44.530]  What a way to cap off year 1.
[04:21:44.610 --> 04:21:46.950]  Much like the company itself almost went
[04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:48.210]  down in flames, but
[04:21:49.690 --> 04:21:50.570]  we unslept.
[04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:53.150]  Do you want to show some stats?
[04:21:54.270 --> 04:21:54.610]  Geoff?
[04:21:55.230 --> 04:21:56.590]  Do I want to show some stats?
[04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.490]  Yeah, don't you?
[04:22:00.430 --> 04:22:02.290]  You mean, do I want to hit some buttons?
[04:22:02.430 --> 04:22:03.570]  I got item space.
[04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:07.130]  I'm going to clear us off
[04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:08.230]  for a second so we can see
[04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.470]  information.
[04:22:12.010 --> 04:22:13.490]  Okay, there it is.
[04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:15.330]  Dill got 15 stars total.
[04:22:15.330 --> 04:22:17.050]  Dude, look at that.
[04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:19.510]  You got 10 more than me.
[04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:20.010]  Wild.
[04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:22.930]  I got the reaction bonus.
[04:22:23.070 --> 04:22:24.470]  Oh, look at you.
[04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:27.390]  SewageSeer5gifted,
[04:22:27.390 --> 04:22:28.470]  thank you guys so much.
[04:22:28.510 --> 04:22:29.230]  I got 3 achievements.
[04:22:31.050 --> 04:22:32.070]  Way to go, man.
[04:22:33.690 --> 04:22:35.250]  New inventory in stock.
[04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:36.910]  Oh, you got that too?
[04:22:37.230 --> 04:22:38.310]  No, not that also.
[04:22:38.910 --> 04:22:39.430]  Alright.
[04:22:41.610 --> 04:22:43.150]  Gang, we did it.
[04:22:44.110 --> 04:22:45.470]  What a way to cap it.
[04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.550]  What a day.
[04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:49.370]  Yeah, just go to us.
[04:22:49.410 --> 04:22:50.470]  That's fine. We can end it here.
[04:22:51.390 --> 04:22:52.410]  Guys, thank you.
[04:22:52.690 --> 04:22:55.230]  We could not have done this without you over the last year.
[04:22:55.850 --> 04:22:57.310]  We've grown a lot.
[04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:58.530]  One more year.
[04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:01.470]  70 more, we said.
[04:23:01.890 --> 04:23:02.690]  70 more years.
[04:23:03.730 --> 04:23:04.870]  Hopefully that's in the books.
[04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:07.470]  Thank you guys so much for joining us today.
[04:23:08.530 --> 04:23:09.690]  This has been a lot of fun.
[04:23:10.030 --> 04:23:11.310]  The VOD of this will go up
[04:23:11.310 --> 04:23:12.410]  in different pieces and parts.
[04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:13.350]  We'll do the house tour.
[04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:16.530]  We'll have 31 turns of Mario Party.
[04:23:18.670 --> 04:23:21.130]  And you'll start to see stuff filmed in the office now.
[04:23:21.130 --> 04:23:21.370]  Yes.
[04:23:21.650 --> 04:23:23.550]  So now the band-aid's ripped off
[04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:24.710]  and we can actually do stuff here.
[04:23:24.850 --> 04:23:25.610]  I'm really excited.
[04:23:25.890 --> 04:23:26.870]  There'll be a lot of stuff for Patreon
[04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:29.350]  and you can sign up at RegulateTreon.com
[04:23:29.350 --> 04:23:30.050]  if you haven't already.
[04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.630]  Patreon.com.
[04:23:32.810 --> 04:23:36.770]  This has been great.
[04:23:36.970 --> 04:23:38.510]  We really appreciate you guys coming through
[04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:40.430]  and spending any time with us here today.
[04:23:41.290 --> 04:23:42.110]  Thank you guys.
[04:23:42.390 --> 04:23:43.450]  This has been fantastic.
[04:23:44.430 --> 04:23:45.590]  Let's raid Ray.
[04:23:45.770 --> 04:23:48.350]  Since he was here earlier and he's so helpful to us.
[04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:49.830]  Let's raid Ray.
[04:23:49.970 --> 04:23:51.030]  Hopefully he's not in the shitter.
[04:23:51.310 --> 04:23:52.150]  No, not yet.
[04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:54.670]  Let's do this.
[04:23:55.150 --> 04:23:57.670]  That was so much fun.
[04:23:58.170 --> 04:23:59.070]  Cool, guys.
[04:23:59.750 --> 04:24:02.110]  This has been a really fun thing.
[04:24:03.790 --> 04:24:04.370]  Hit that.
[04:24:04.850 --> 04:24:06.090]  Let's have Andrew say goodbye.
[04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:09.730]  Andrew, thank you very much.
[04:24:10.050 --> 04:24:10.610]  Appreciate you guys.
[04:24:10.810 --> 04:24:11.490]  I'll let you know when.
[04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:13.490]  Guys, Andrew the robot.
[04:24:14.130 --> 04:24:15.670]  Andrew, you're going to take us off.
[04:24:16.190 --> 04:24:18.610]  Big finale for me, Andrew!
[04:24:19.230 --> 04:24:20.150]  Going to raid Ray.
[04:24:20.250 --> 04:24:21.010]  Andrew, go crazy!
[04:24:22.450 --> 04:24:23.570]  Oh my God.
[04:24:24.230 --> 04:24:25.790]  He shook free of Gavin.
