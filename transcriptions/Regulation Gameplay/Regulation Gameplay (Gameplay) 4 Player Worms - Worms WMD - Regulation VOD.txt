[00:00.000 --> 00:01.740]  Are we live? Are we real live?
[00:02.460 --> 00:05.260]  Oh we're live! We're definitely live.
[00:05.440 --> 00:06.740]  Alert! Alert!
[00:06.960 --> 00:08.740]  This is a six player game!
[00:09.380 --> 00:10.440]  Buh buh buh! Buh buh buh!
[00:10.820 --> 00:11.440]  Buh buh buh!
[00:12.380 --> 00:15.080]  There's only four of us playing today.
[00:15.180 --> 00:16.480]  Yeah, sometimes we play with just four.
[00:18.940 --> 00:20.680]  Commander, there's a memo coming through!
[00:21.400 --> 00:23.080]  It says six players!
[00:25.220 --> 00:26.520]  Man the worms!
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.720]  You will be banned. No, I'm kidding.
[00:30.140 --> 00:32.080]  Yeah, what if you get Meg's account banned
[00:32.080 --> 00:33.860]  also on Worms for doing whatever you did before?
[00:34.040 --> 00:35.720]  Then you're going to be really in trouble.
[00:35.740 --> 00:38.190]  That'd be rough because I've got some names that I'm not sure will make it.
[00:38.860 --> 00:39.620]  Oh no!
[00:40.960 --> 00:41.380]  Speaking of
[00:41.960 --> 00:44.420]  couldn't make it, Eric couldn't make it today so...
[00:44.420 --> 00:45.220]  That's true!
[00:45.480 --> 00:47.660]  We're bravely soldiering on.
[00:47.940 --> 00:48.760]  With four of us.
[00:49.080 --> 00:51.460]  In Worms, a five player game.
[00:52.760 --> 00:53.260]  At least five.
[00:53.880 --> 00:55.320]  This weekend started much earlier.
[00:55.960 --> 00:56.740]  It's also at least four.
[00:57.640 --> 00:58.000]  Yeah!
[00:58.200 --> 01:00.120]  It could even be at least two, I believe. It's crazy.
[01:00.440 --> 01:01.580]  There's so many player variants.
[01:02.500 --> 01:04.240]  Alright, we've got a lot of piss rats in the chat
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.740]  so I think we're good to start.
[01:06.060 --> 01:07.800]  We're good to start? Well good, because we started.
[01:07.820 --> 01:09.860]  Maybe we'll have a Corn Cat-less Friday.
[01:10.260 --> 01:11.400]  I'll be going first.
[01:13.040 --> 01:14.300]  Oh, I like the clown.
[01:14.740 --> 01:15.180]  Nice clown.
[01:16.580 --> 01:18.940]  Are you going to break in a song like in Joker 2?
[01:19.580 --> 01:20.200]  Uh, yeah.
[01:20.220 --> 01:21.940]  Oh, I didn't see it. Now you spoiled it.
[01:21.940 --> 01:22.020]  Oh, there's a metal.
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.200]  Oh, there's a rabbit.
[01:26.980 --> 01:27.540]  Uh...
[01:27.540 --> 01:29.780]  That's me. What am I even doing here?
[01:30.540 --> 01:32.180]  Oh, Crackle.
[01:33.160 --> 01:33.680]  Uh oh. Uh oh.
[01:34.340 --> 01:35.740]  Uh oh. Gak hazard.
[01:35.780 --> 01:37.020]  What button is attack again?
[01:37.540 --> 01:38.080]  Is it X?
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.100]  Why are you...
[01:41.100 --> 01:42.680]  No! Take that!
[01:43.980 --> 01:46.020]  Let me in! Let me in there!
[01:46.220 --> 01:46.860]  Let me in there!
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.140]  No, die! Die for your crimes!
[01:50.140 --> 01:50.800]  No!
[01:52.080 --> 01:52.440]  No!
[01:53.680 --> 01:55.860]  Wow, you just murdered Nick. Who was that?
[01:56.020 --> 01:58.920]  Oh, I'm sorry Nick. I assumed the name Crackle would be Gavin.
[01:59.620 --> 02:00.840]  No, Crackle is gone.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.740]  Why would you try and kill me if I was Crackle?
[02:03.000 --> 02:03.880]  No, I wasn't trying to kill you.
[02:03.960 --> 02:05.360]  I just figured that would be your name.
[02:05.540 --> 02:08.480]  No, I was just saying I'm surprised it was Nick.
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.180]  Who were you trying to kill?
[02:11.300 --> 02:11.660]  Crackle.
[02:13.140 --> 02:14.780]  I'm just surprised that that's Nick.
[02:14.980 --> 02:16.200]  Who did you think it was?
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.680]  I assumed it was Gavin, but that's not why I targeted it.
[02:20.120 --> 02:22.380]  I targeted it because it was in my view
[02:22.380 --> 02:23.380]  and it was on the side.
[02:23.620 --> 02:24.960]  I'm just saying I'm surprised.
[02:25.940 --> 02:27.420]  This is Eric. Feels like a Gavin name.
[02:27.980 --> 02:29.560]  What? Yeah, he couldn't make it today,
[02:29.640 --> 02:31.340]  so I wanted to help him.
[02:31.580 --> 02:32.560]  Do you have a team of Erics?
[02:33.560 --> 02:34.980]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.760]  Oh, Aussie Stungy Stungus.
[02:37.760 --> 02:39.640]  I don't know what to do.
[02:40.280 --> 02:41.120]  I don't know what to do.
[02:41.880 --> 02:43.660]  Oh, thank you so much for the subs.
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.060]  What the fuck?
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.340]  There we go.
[02:48.040 --> 02:49.420]  What's going on over here?
[02:50.000 --> 02:50.760]  I suck.
[02:51.520 --> 02:52.040]  Okay.
[02:56.990 --> 02:57.510]  Oh!
[03:00.790 --> 03:01.970]  That is in your mouth.
[03:02.350 --> 03:03.330]  Yeah, I suck.
[03:04.270 --> 03:06.630]  Well, that guy is either as safe as can be
[03:06.630 --> 03:07.650]  or dead as dicks.
[03:08.170 --> 03:09.490]  Oh, it's cracked slime.
[03:10.530 --> 03:10.790]  Oh.
[03:12.450 --> 03:13.390]  Sphinctal Bicky.
[03:14.090 --> 03:16.670]  Sphinctal Bicky, and then we've got Eric Snap and A.
[03:18.770 --> 03:20.190]  I wonder if I should just plow through
[03:20.190 --> 03:21.290]  and get Snap and A.
[03:21.650 --> 03:24.470]  No! Please, I've lost so much already.
[03:24.970 --> 03:26.810]  I think I have to start from the other side.
[03:27.350 --> 03:28.570]  There's so much more you could lose, though.
[03:28.670 --> 03:29.270]  I know!
[03:29.830 --> 03:31.970]  I think it flings you the other way.
[03:32.090 --> 03:33.050]  Don't take out Snappa.
[03:34.430 --> 03:35.730]  Leave Snappa alone.
[03:36.570 --> 03:37.550]  Snappa is friends.
[03:38.070 --> 03:38.730]  I need to turn.
[03:40.090 --> 03:40.670]  You got this.
[03:41.810 --> 03:42.190]  Oh, no.
[03:43.830 --> 03:44.670]  You got it.
[03:44.670 --> 03:45.170]  Be too high.
[03:46.390 --> 03:47.570]  You're going down.
[03:47.970 --> 03:49.310]  You're going down.
[03:49.610 --> 03:50.350]  I missed.
[03:51.910 --> 03:52.350]  Whoa!
[03:54.650 --> 03:55.490]  Not me, though.
[03:56.950 --> 03:58.490]  Okay, A got lucky.
[04:00.890 --> 04:01.530]  I...
[04:03.990 --> 04:04.630]  Well...
[04:05.310 --> 04:07.050]  You're having a tough day, Nick.
[04:08.810 --> 04:10.290]  Oh, I lost one.
[04:10.750 --> 04:10.810]  Oh!
[04:10.810 --> 04:11.190]  Oh!
[04:12.870 --> 04:14.330]  Milfstain didn't make it.
[04:15.070 --> 04:17.410]  You thought Milfstain would make the cut?
[04:17.790 --> 04:18.730]  I don't know. I thought it might.
[04:20.750 --> 04:21.610]  Oh, it's Eric and Eric.
[04:21.610 --> 04:22.350]  Oh, my morgues.
[04:22.390 --> 04:23.270]  Thank you for all the subs.
[04:24.950 --> 04:26.110]  Oh, my God. Thank you.
[04:26.530 --> 04:28.150]  Oh, my morgues. If I get the subs, thanks.
[04:28.570 --> 04:29.970]  Thank you very much.
[04:30.210 --> 04:31.270]  Oh, my morgues.
[04:32.070 --> 04:33.330]  How do you...
[04:33.330 --> 04:35.410]  This turn is for the morgues.
[04:36.770 --> 04:38.850]  For all the morgues out there.
[04:39.390 --> 04:40.510]  We're talking to you.
[04:41.970 --> 04:43.030]  Oh, good throw.
[04:43.730 --> 04:44.070]  Thank you.
[04:44.210 --> 04:45.110]  Great throw.
[04:46.090 --> 04:46.490]  Oh!
[04:48.470 --> 04:49.710]  That wasn't your fault.
[04:50.310 --> 04:51.050]  Nice knowing you, Pop.
[04:55.450 --> 04:55.850]  Clowning.
[04:56.650 --> 04:59.090]  I mean, clowning's got to just top on this, right?
[04:59.170 --> 04:59.970]  And see what happens.
[05:02.190 --> 05:03.950]  Are you guys excited about the Celtics game tonight?
[05:04.230 --> 05:05.370]  Oh, I cannot wait.
[05:05.490 --> 05:06.130]  Yeah, me too.
[05:10.960 --> 05:12.140]  Oh, that worked very well.
[05:12.220 --> 05:13.560]  Oh, I shoot more than once.
[05:14.040 --> 05:15.980]  God, you just ended me.
[05:16.180 --> 05:16.520]  That was me.
[05:16.960 --> 05:18.340]  You killed Eric with an A.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.440]  I thought I killed Gavin. I thought he was Eric.
[05:21.900 --> 05:23.220]  You keep thinking you're killing me.
[05:23.620 --> 05:25.400]  I do, but I'm not targeting you.
[05:25.500 --> 05:27.080]  I just keep thinking, oh, that's Gavin.
[05:28.040 --> 05:28.960]  Listen, that's funny.
[05:30.680 --> 05:30.880]  Oh, no.
[05:31.240 --> 05:33.120]  Thanks for the 10 gifted subs.
[05:33.580 --> 05:35.400]  Holy shit, thank you so much.
[05:35.800 --> 05:36.560]  Good luck with your hands.
[05:36.560 --> 05:38.560]  How do I move the fucking...
[05:39.280 --> 05:40.640]  Uh, the left joystick.
[05:40.980 --> 05:41.880]  And then X to shoot.
[05:43.180 --> 05:44.320]  Hold your fire, soldier!
[05:44.920 --> 05:45.320]  Whoa!
[05:46.460 --> 05:47.760]  Oh, it stopped. I can't shoot no more.
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.580]  I can't fly no more.
[05:51.140 --> 05:52.580]  Those are warning shots.
[05:53.420 --> 05:54.880]  I thought, yeah, there's more
[05:54.880 --> 05:55.880]  where that came from, losers.
[05:56.400 --> 05:56.800]  Sweet.
[05:57.760 --> 05:58.580]  I'll remember that.
[05:58.940 --> 06:01.320]  It's time for Sphinctle Bicky.
[06:02.400 --> 06:03.460]  You said Dicky, didn't you?
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.280]  Bicky.
[06:04.820 --> 06:06.480]  No, but Andrew said Dicky.
[06:06.520 --> 06:07.920]  Did I? I didn't mean to if I did.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.660]  Am I the wrong one? I might be.
[06:11.860 --> 06:12.960]  You're throwing a sheep?
[06:13.680 --> 06:13.960]  Uh-oh.
[06:14.260 --> 06:14.700]  Jump!
[06:16.560 --> 06:17.560]  Oh, no!
[06:19.000 --> 06:19.440]  Shit!
[06:20.680 --> 06:21.860]  That was too far.
[06:23.340 --> 06:24.560]  Oh, that was such a good move.
[06:24.940 --> 06:26.600]  I just sent that sheep to his death.
[06:27.280 --> 06:27.400]  Oh.
[06:29.520 --> 06:30.680]  What have we here?
[06:31.520 --> 06:33.020]  Oh, you got a smashing machine.
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.220]  Who is Cornfield?
[06:36.700 --> 06:38.160]  Oh, it's Andrew. That would be me.
[06:38.860 --> 06:40.260]  I don't want to hurt you, Andrew.
[06:40.420 --> 06:42.480]  You've been hitting this clown in a cornfield real hard.
[06:43.520 --> 06:44.700]  It's the cinematic
[06:44.700 --> 06:46.240]  masterpiece of the summer.
[06:46.360 --> 06:47.840]  Go see Clown in a Cornfield.
[06:50.420 --> 06:51.140]  When does that come out?
[06:51.160 --> 06:52.480]  Leave the cornfield alone!
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.600]  Listen, the thing about cornfields is...
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.560]  The cornfield did nothing to you.
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.940]  The thing about cornfields is...
[07:00.320 --> 07:01.400]  They're unstoppable!
[07:01.940 --> 07:04.160]  That's the thing about cornfields!
[07:05.520 --> 07:08.120]  That was only 11 damage.
[07:08.180 --> 07:08.620]  I'm impressed.
[07:08.860 --> 07:11.080]  I can't believe I did not get killed.
[07:12.360 --> 07:13.780]  I'm tracked slime, Andrew.
[07:14.020 --> 07:14.720]  I'm so scared.
[07:15.320 --> 07:16.180]  Want to open my stuff?
[07:16.860 --> 07:19.200]  Tracked slime didn't go for you, though.
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.440]  He tried to.
[07:22.100 --> 07:22.640]  Oh!
[07:23.320 --> 07:23.920]  Oh!
[07:24.020 --> 07:24.620]  Oh!
[07:27.680 --> 07:30.320]  The other guy just shot the wall!
[07:36.400 --> 07:38.140]  That was the best.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.400]  I love it.
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.420]  Oh, God.
[07:41.840 --> 07:43.340]  God help us.
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.040]  I just wanted to put them all in one spot.
[07:48.180 --> 07:50.980]  I was so excited about getting them all in one frame.
[07:50.980 --> 07:53.980]  I was pretty excited about that.
[08:00.240 --> 08:00.800]  X.
[08:05.120 --> 08:06.240]  Okay, that's...
[08:06.240 --> 08:07.200]  Tracked slime.
[08:07.880 --> 08:08.440]  No!
[08:09.500 --> 08:11.280]  It's like the worm in Limbo!
[08:11.700 --> 08:13.240]  You're not turning around anymore, son!
[08:13.980 --> 08:14.540]  He's off!
[08:17.780 --> 08:20.520]  Why didn't it just blow the fuck up when I got the gas in?
[08:20.520 --> 08:22.120]  It doesn't do that.
[08:22.660 --> 08:23.840]  You un-detonate them, I think.
[08:24.380 --> 08:24.980]  I tried!
[08:25.560 --> 08:27.640]  Oh, it's Gak Hazard.
[08:28.140 --> 08:30.580]  Gak Hazard, back at it.
[08:37.660 --> 08:39.940]  I might just hop on this gun, you know?
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.300]  It's a nice little gun.
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.480]  Oh, the guns are great.
[08:44.160 --> 08:44.620]  Great gun.
[08:44.980 --> 08:46.460]  I don't think I've ever used them before.
[08:46.460 --> 08:47.880]  Oh, it's a machine gun.
[08:48.000 --> 08:48.620]  Is that a machine gun?
[08:48.960 --> 08:50.840]  Oh, it sure is.
[08:51.760 --> 08:52.700]  Hey, hold your fire.
[08:53.740 --> 08:54.260]  We're friends.
[08:54.680 --> 08:56.440]  Gavin's about to go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
[08:56.740 --> 08:59.820]  Yeah, I'm about to make the sound of your worm name.
[09:01.160 --> 09:01.780]  Oh, shit!
[09:03.380 --> 09:04.420]  I shot myself!
[09:07.640 --> 09:11.140]  Imagine getting shot so hard you were physically moving a helicopter.
[09:14.900 --> 09:15.340]  Whoa!
[09:16.180 --> 09:16.900]  That was lucky.
[09:20.520 --> 09:22.340]  Uh-oh, it's pop up next.
[09:22.780 --> 09:25.300]  Pop, do you by any chance forget what just happened?
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.240]  You got this, Pop.
[09:32.740 --> 09:34.640]  You're going to want to go after Gak Hazard
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.660]  because he's got that gun trained on you still.
[09:37.120 --> 09:38.880]  Yeah, but he's alright though.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.160]  He didn't kill you.
[09:40.800 --> 09:41.680]  He tried.
[09:43.400 --> 09:44.240]  He did try.
[09:45.360 --> 09:46.220]  He did try.
[09:46.600 --> 09:49.420]  His old Eric with an E and a K, he's just going to fly away.
[09:49.640 --> 09:50.700]  See, I'd say that's a big risk
[09:50.700 --> 09:52.380]  because of wind and like...
[09:52.380 --> 09:55.640]  I felt pretty good about that shot.
[09:55.840 --> 09:56.080]  Okay.
[09:57.320 --> 09:57.760]  Interesting.
[09:57.940 --> 09:59.740]  Hey, Gak, why don't you chill out?
[10:03.340 --> 10:06.680]  Hey, rabbit, how did you get down here?
[10:06.680 --> 10:08.980]  What a cause that.
[10:09.600 --> 10:10.920]  What occurred.
[10:11.940 --> 10:13.560]  What a cause that.
[10:14.880 --> 10:16.580]  Wait, who's rabbit?
[10:18.240 --> 10:18.520]  Me.
[10:19.140 --> 10:19.540]  No!
[10:20.160 --> 10:22.240]  No, I can't sneak in there!
[10:22.780 --> 10:23.280]  No!
[10:23.800 --> 10:25.540]  Get out of there.
[10:26.160 --> 10:27.660]  That is a rough day for Nick.
[10:28.360 --> 10:30.780]  Well, it's down to...
[10:30.780 --> 10:31.140]  Pop.
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.080]  He's dead.
[10:33.080 --> 10:33.960]  He's dead.
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.020]  Go see clowning
[10:37.020 --> 10:37.560]  cornfield.
[10:39.960 --> 10:41.120]  Did he start out yet?
[10:42.540 --> 10:43.200]  Who knows
[10:43.200 --> 10:43.820]  who bought it?
[10:45.240 --> 10:46.420]  When's Edmund come out?
[10:47.300 --> 10:48.060]  Next week.
[10:49.900 --> 10:50.720]  Not even...
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.300]  Isn't it a few days?
[10:54.620 --> 10:55.260]  I don't know.
[10:55.300 --> 10:56.500]  You're the clown in the cornfield guy.
[10:56.960 --> 10:57.180]  Yeah.
[10:57.500 --> 10:59.720]  I thought we were talking about the content, not the clown.
[10:59.720 --> 11:02.000]  Every Saturday,
[11:02.200 --> 11:03.540]  go up to your local cornfield and find the clown.
[11:04.840 --> 11:05.800]  Yeah, the movie
[11:05.800 --> 11:07.300]  auction comes out this weekend, I think.
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.240]  Oh, that's awesome. Like tomorrow?
[11:10.020 --> 11:10.740]  Or Sunday?
[11:10.900 --> 11:12.560]  It's either Saturday or Sunday, yeah, I think.
[11:13.040 --> 11:14.200]  Those are the two days of the weekend.
[11:15.360 --> 11:15.840]  That's a good point.
[11:18.660 --> 11:19.460]  He's got me there.
[11:21.080 --> 11:21.440]  Thief.
[11:23.520 --> 11:24.700]  Stay away from that gun.
[11:25.840 --> 11:26.860]  The gun is dangerous.
[11:26.860 --> 11:27.680]  Where's the gun?
[11:30.600 --> 11:31.480]  The gun.
[11:31.860 --> 11:36.580]  Oh, there's a gun there, too.
[11:37.960 --> 11:39.140]  Is that the end of my turn?
[11:39.280 --> 11:39.680]  Or am I alright?
[11:39.940 --> 11:41.540]  No, you're good. You have 20 seconds.
[11:43.080 --> 11:43.680]  Oh, shit.
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.580]  What's the move?
[11:51.200 --> 11:52.420]  I'm glad you asked, son.
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.180]  This is the move.
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.060]  Oh, shit.
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.940]  Third time surely.
[11:57.740 --> 11:59.320]  It's a super sheep.
[12:00.140 --> 12:02.200]  Where was everyone? Where did I come from?
[12:02.300 --> 12:03.020]  Get Sphinctle Bicky.
[12:03.900 --> 12:05.080]  No, go back.
[12:06.240 --> 12:08.520]  Oh, I lived!
[12:09.400 --> 12:10.020]  I did not.
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.620]  Gert Paul's Glug Race.
[12:13.980 --> 12:14.920]  Thanks for the...
[12:16.260 --> 12:17.880]  Gert Paul's Glug Race.
[12:20.700 --> 12:22.260]  Gert Paul's Glug Race.
[12:22.260 --> 12:26.280]  This is my new favorite Twitch username that I've ever seen.
[12:26.340 --> 12:27.460]  Oh, that's so funny.
[12:29.780 --> 12:32.460]  What do I want to do here?
[12:34.420 --> 12:35.960]  Paul's Glug Race.
[12:38.240 --> 12:39.720]  That really tickled you, Gavin.
[12:40.000 --> 12:40.500]  It did.
[12:40.980 --> 12:41.620]  It's really funny.
[12:43.060 --> 12:44.440]  Oh, nice. A little holy hand grenade.
[12:45.680 --> 12:46.800]  That'll fuck him up.
[12:47.940 --> 12:48.900]  Here for the clown?
[12:49.520 --> 12:50.160]  Oh, no.
[12:50.940 --> 12:52.940]  Oh, that was almost so good.
[12:53.260 --> 12:54.800]  It didn't bounce.
[12:54.920 --> 12:55.620]  It was perfect.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.860]  You gave me a real close look at a holy hand grenade.
[12:59.560 --> 12:59.960]  Well...
[13:00.640 --> 13:01.800]  That'll be the end of Nick.
[13:02.160 --> 13:04.820]  Yeah, that's gonna do it for your old boy, Nick.
[13:04.940 --> 13:06.840]  Oh, no. There's so much stuff over here.
[13:09.740 --> 13:10.260]  Go see.
[13:10.620 --> 13:12.320]  I can do it. I believe in myself.
[13:13.420 --> 13:14.480]  I believe in myself.
[13:16.180 --> 13:17.400]  Faster than the turrets!
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.360]  Faster than the...
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.260]  He's going over them.
[13:22.660 --> 13:23.820]  Where's he going, though?
[13:23.820 --> 13:24.360]  Where's the stuff?
[13:29.080 --> 13:30.160]  Where's he off to?
[13:32.540 --> 13:33.880]  He's gone stuff shopping.
[13:34.180 --> 13:35.120]  There's another stuff down there.
[13:35.660 --> 13:36.900]  Oh, my God!
[13:38.800 --> 13:40.460]  Oh, my God!
[13:40.880 --> 13:41.540]  Look out!
[13:41.680 --> 13:43.560]  I'm lighting myself on fire!
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.940]  Oh, my balls.
[13:46.940 --> 13:47.740]  There's five more.
[13:48.300 --> 13:50.400]  Oh, it's gonna blow.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.960]  It's gonna blow.
[13:54.240 --> 13:56.060]  Thank you so much for the subs.
[13:58.000 --> 13:58.600]  MKNUDSTRUP
[13:58.600 --> 14:00.940]  Careful. Careful, Eric.
[14:03.100 --> 14:03.980]  Oh, no.
[14:04.260 --> 14:06.600]  Oh, you got the old biddy.
[14:07.600 --> 14:08.160]  Oh, what?
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.480]  Oh, what is this guy?
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.840]  What is this?
[14:12.700 --> 14:13.280]  Oh, no.
[14:13.280 --> 14:14.060]  Oh, no.
[14:22.880 --> 14:25.080]  Never fart up wind.
[14:25.560 --> 14:26.360]  Oh!
[14:29.860 --> 14:31.520]  She farted in your face.
[14:31.720 --> 14:33.180]  I'm like a sock.
[14:37.880 --> 14:39.360]  Holy shit.
[14:39.380 --> 14:40.300]  Oh, my God.
[14:40.300 --> 14:41.060]  Oh, my balls.
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.000]  501, please.
[14:43.340 --> 14:44.120]  I've got a plan.
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.140]  Geoff, we've got a while.
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.700]  How can we be so close and so far from 501?
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.700]  I don't know.
[14:53.820 --> 14:54.160]  Oh, shit.
[14:56.080 --> 14:56.600]  All right, he's out.
[14:59.180 --> 14:59.680]  Okay.
[15:01.320 --> 15:02.000]  Excuse me.
[15:02.820 --> 15:03.260]  See ya!
[15:05.340 --> 15:05.680]  Oh!
[15:05.680 --> 15:05.760]  Oh!
[15:06.820 --> 15:07.460]  Oh!
[15:09.280 --> 15:11.740]  That was pretty impressive.
[15:12.500 --> 15:13.640]  I can't believe that worked.
[15:14.120 --> 15:15.060]  I gotta say.
[15:15.260 --> 15:15.900]  Wow.
[15:22.890 --> 15:23.950]  Holy shit.
[15:24.430 --> 15:25.390]  Good job, Gavin.
[15:25.610 --> 15:26.690]  Gavin is doing great.
[15:28.810 --> 15:29.950]  Nick's still alive.
[15:30.230 --> 15:30.930]  Yeah, somehow.
[15:31.990 --> 15:33.270]  So we learned last time.
[15:37.860 --> 15:38.500]  That one's good.
[15:40.280 --> 15:41.400]  Oh, no.
[15:42.240 --> 15:42.940]  Yeah!
[15:43.580 --> 15:44.240]  No!
[15:45.240 --> 15:47.220]  That son of a bitch!
[15:48.280 --> 15:49.640]  Holy shit.
[15:50.100 --> 15:52.180]  I can't believe this horse shit.
[15:55.360 --> 15:56.820]  That's insane.
[15:57.280 --> 15:59.120]  I can't believe it.
[15:59.200 --> 16:00.800]  You found the stretch of beach.
[16:01.300 --> 16:01.520]  Uh-oh.
[16:02.960 --> 16:03.300]  Oh!
[16:05.140 --> 16:06.200]  He's dead.
[16:11.440 --> 16:12.900]  Nice job, clowning.
[16:13.140 --> 16:14.060]  Yeah, good teamwork.
[16:15.700 --> 16:16.720]  He's dismissed.
[16:18.080 --> 16:19.500]  Dismissed gag hazard.
[16:23.120 --> 16:24.140]  All right.
[16:24.240 --> 16:25.740]  That's some cave protection.
[16:26.740 --> 16:27.260]  Yeah.
[16:29.020 --> 16:30.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:30.780 --> 16:33.260]  Yeah, I got some cave protection.
[16:33.480 --> 16:34.420]  You know how that is.
[16:34.600 --> 16:35.300]  Cave protection.
[16:37.380 --> 16:38.700]  Oh, I see. I like what you're thinking.
[16:39.240 --> 16:39.460]  Yeah.
[16:39.700 --> 16:41.640]  Just have a look.
[16:42.300 --> 16:43.580]  That seems unnecessary.
[16:43.740 --> 16:46.660]  I'm just having a little time with the water.
[16:47.620 --> 16:48.100]  Oh!
[16:49.840 --> 16:50.320]  Oh!
[16:50.520 --> 16:51.680]  Oh, that vehicle.
[16:51.920 --> 16:52.180]  Wow.
[16:52.340 --> 16:55.620]  That'll blow up soon.
[16:56.860 --> 16:58.840]  My watch just told me I'm being too loud.
[17:01.500 --> 17:02.180]  Okay.
[17:02.380 --> 17:03.200]  The windage
[17:03.200 --> 17:04.580]  looks decent.
[17:06.200 --> 17:07.580]  So I think
[17:07.580 --> 17:08.580]  a lovely little
[17:08.580 --> 17:10.040]  one of these.
[17:11.420 --> 17:13.180]  Thanks, Clunge Meister.
[17:13.740 --> 17:14.800]  What are you doing there?
[17:14.920 --> 17:16.000]  Thanks, Bim Tech.
[17:17.040 --> 17:17.720]  Okay.
[17:17.900 --> 17:20.560]  I like what you're...
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.800]  Oh, my God.
[17:22.100 --> 17:24.060]  Oh, no.
[17:25.080 --> 17:25.760]  Wow.
[17:26.540 --> 17:27.020]  Okay.
[17:27.380 --> 17:29.180]  Too bad you can't just cook it, you know?
[17:29.380 --> 17:30.660]  A little too much Bickey on that.
[17:31.080 --> 17:32.520]  A little bit too much of a Bickey.
[17:33.700 --> 17:35.080]  Too much Bickey.
[17:41.480 --> 17:42.220]  I'm learning.
[17:42.780 --> 17:45.360]  Oh, shit.
[17:46.940 --> 17:47.920]  What are you doing?
[17:48.700 --> 17:49.260]  What are you doing?
[17:49.500 --> 17:50.280]  What are you doing?
[17:51.180 --> 17:53.480]  The Bic Meister's minding his own business up there.
[17:53.800 --> 17:54.680]  What are you doing?
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.680]  Oh, man.
[18:01.360 --> 18:02.760]  He's lessening the
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.860]  structural supports. That's going to give way eventually.
[18:05.220 --> 18:06.740]  Eventually? With erosion
[18:06.740 --> 18:08.040]  and time? You're fucked.
[18:08.620 --> 18:09.920]  Cornfield is looking strong.
[18:11.220 --> 18:13.060]  Okay. Let's just get rid of this.
[18:13.520 --> 18:14.760]  Don't think this is necessary
[18:14.760 --> 18:17.000]  because I'm just...
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.040]  Gotta get rid of that.
[18:18.980 --> 18:19.540]  Okay.
[18:20.860 --> 18:21.460]  Explode!
[18:22.320 --> 18:23.320]  Now blow.
[18:23.420 --> 18:23.920]  No!
[18:24.660 --> 18:25.360]  Yeah!
[18:26.340 --> 18:26.720]  Yeah!
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.580]  Oh, my Morgs
[18:31.580 --> 18:33.840]  with a third round and five gifted subs.
[18:33.860 --> 18:34.520]  Oh, my God.
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.680]  Thank you so much.
[18:37.340 --> 18:38.840]  NaviDude as well.
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.340]  Thank you so much.
[18:40.960 --> 18:42.540]  So many Morgs and Navis.
[18:44.240 --> 18:45.860]  Alright. Let's see.
[18:45.980 --> 18:47.220]  What are we going to do?
[18:47.340 --> 18:49.180]  We got people to kill.
[18:49.780 --> 18:51.340]  Murder the enemy.
[18:52.540 --> 18:53.280]  Hate you
[18:53.280 --> 18:55.080]  because you're different. Okay.
[18:56.500 --> 18:57.100]  Yeah.
[18:57.280 --> 18:59.320]  I'll just hate this person.
[19:00.800 --> 19:01.780]  What's this about?
[19:02.740 --> 19:04.800]  It's about sending a message.
[19:06.240 --> 19:07.320]  He doesn't trust the name
[19:07.320 --> 19:07.880]  that he can't see.
[19:08.120 --> 19:09.820]  How did I get popped out?
[19:10.200 --> 19:10.800]  Oh!
[19:13.280 --> 19:13.880]  Stop!
[19:14.420 --> 19:15.020]  Stop!
[19:18.220 --> 19:20.500]  How is it only 30 damage?
[19:20.880 --> 19:21.520]  How are you alive?
[19:22.640 --> 19:23.600]  How are you alive?
[19:24.420 --> 19:26.840]  What the God damn am I going to do here?
[19:30.100 --> 19:31.020]  Don't move.
[19:33.760 --> 19:34.780]  I don't even know
[19:34.780 --> 19:35.720]  if that would work.
[19:36.720 --> 19:38.020]  What am I doing?
[19:38.480 --> 19:39.440]  Where are you going?
[19:40.060 --> 19:42.020]  Get out of the way of that God damn turret.
[19:42.020 --> 19:42.220]  Damn it.
[19:44.520 --> 19:45.400]  But why?
[19:45.560 --> 19:46.560]  You're alright. You're okay.
[19:52.160 --> 19:53.960]  If you had a holy hand grenade,
[19:54.100 --> 19:55.080]  what a throw that can be.
[19:56.780 --> 19:59.560]  If you threaded it,
[19:59.620 --> 20:00.160]  that'd be insane.
[20:00.960 --> 20:02.300]  I don't have a holy hand grenade.
[20:04.980 --> 20:06.140]  Doing a take two
[20:06.140 --> 20:07.280]  on the sphincters.
[20:08.320 --> 20:09.500]  I'm thinking about...
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.080]  You know what?
[20:15.090 --> 20:16.970]  A banana bomb?
[20:17.670 --> 20:18.230]  Yeah, why not?
[20:19.820 --> 20:21.750]  Right up the tailpipe.
[20:30.410 --> 20:32.850]  That was a sketchy Donna.
[20:33.310 --> 20:34.150]  I could have gone better.
[20:34.150 --> 20:35.670]  Oh shit.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.860]  I'm learning about
[20:43.860 --> 20:45.400]  weights and distances.
[20:47.200 --> 20:48.040]  What did you guys
[20:48.040 --> 20:48.680]  have for lunch today?
[20:49.720 --> 20:50.960]  I haven't eaten yet.
[20:54.380 --> 20:54.940]  Shit.
[20:56.080 --> 20:56.300]  What?
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.320]  What was that about?
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.000]  Is that your only shot?
[21:01.460 --> 21:02.320]  Yeah, that was it.
[21:03.240 --> 21:04.000]  Turn over.
[21:04.420 --> 21:05.760]  I'm incredibly disappointed.
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.300]  So disappointing.
[21:07.820 --> 21:09.940]  I had eggs and English muffins.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.180]  Eggs and English muffins.
[21:12.380 --> 21:14.140]  What about you, Geoff?
[21:14.180 --> 21:14.640]  What did you have?
[21:15.300 --> 21:17.000]  I had some al pastor tacos.
[21:17.760 --> 21:20.020]  While I was out running errands.
[21:20.060 --> 21:20.520]  Where'd you go?
[21:21.240 --> 21:23.780]  Pueblo Viejo. It's a taco truck over on Tillery.
[21:24.360 --> 21:25.540]  Are you back on trucks?
[21:26.900 --> 21:27.780]  Yeah, sometimes.
[21:28.120 --> 21:30.040]  I thought we were giving it a break since the anal worms.
[21:30.040 --> 21:32.180]  Dude, it's been a years
[21:32.180 --> 21:32.800]  long break.
[21:33.800 --> 21:35.140]  I'm back at it though.
[21:36.160 --> 21:36.580]  Well...
[21:39.040 --> 21:40.020]  I don't think
[21:40.020 --> 21:41.000]  it'll get to you, but I'm going to see.
[21:42.340 --> 21:43.180]  Oh shit.
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.880]  Oh, that donkey saved you, man.
[21:46.340 --> 21:47.880]  The tank saved me more than anything.
[21:48.040 --> 21:48.620]  Oh yeah.
[21:49.540 --> 21:50.940]  Is the tank going to explode?
[21:52.140 --> 21:53.240]  Oh, it's thinking about it.
[21:53.320 --> 21:54.060]  I should be so lucky.
[21:55.620 --> 21:56.780]  Okay, let's see.
[21:56.780 --> 21:57.340]  Oh god.
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.020]  Hand grenade scared the shit out of me.
[22:00.100 --> 22:01.880]  Yeah, I don't blame you. Not a lot of room.
[22:02.440 --> 22:04.980]  I might have to go on a bit of a shopping spree here.
[22:05.740 --> 22:06.560]  Oh, you're shopping?
[22:06.880 --> 22:07.180]  Shit!
[22:08.580 --> 22:09.020]  Oh!
[22:09.620 --> 22:11.360]  I wanted you to die.
[22:13.400 --> 22:14.460]  Oh, damn it.
[22:15.060 --> 22:16.000]  Wow, dude.
[22:16.000 --> 22:16.700]  That's a lot of health.
[22:18.860 --> 22:20.800]  That's a durable worm you got right there.
[22:20.980 --> 22:22.460]  That's a strong worm, isn't it?
[22:22.660 --> 22:23.400]  Holy shit!
[22:23.400 --> 22:23.500]  Yeah!
[22:24.120 --> 22:25.840]  Alright, let's send this one.
[22:26.480 --> 22:29.540]  Let's have a think about the trajectories here.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.060]  What are we going to try and get?
[22:31.060 --> 22:32.500]  I'm curious to see what he's going to do here.
[22:32.840 --> 22:34.100]  I think I'm going to have to go for pop.
[22:35.340 --> 22:35.720]  What?
[22:37.960 --> 22:38.440]  Three.
[22:38.580 --> 22:39.760]  That's a hell of a throw, man.
[22:40.380 --> 22:43.100]  If you make it, holy...
[22:43.100 --> 22:44.500]  Oh my god.
[22:44.900 --> 22:46.060]  It's going to have to be a bank job.
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.540]  Oh!
[22:48.820 --> 22:49.300]  Oh!
[22:49.300 --> 22:50.140]  Oh!
[22:51.920 --> 22:53.300]  Oh my morgues!
[22:53.400 --> 22:54.940]  Five more gifted subs!
[22:55.220 --> 22:57.020]  Thank you so much on my morgues!
[22:57.240 --> 22:57.520]  Thank you!
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.640]  Are you saying lunatic as in you're a lunatic?
[23:01.740 --> 23:02.980]  Or a lunatic also gifted subs?
[23:03.040 --> 23:05.000]  No, just he's a lunatic.
[23:06.100 --> 23:07.760]  He's a sub-given lunatic.
[23:08.280 --> 23:09.300]  Let me...
[23:10.460 --> 23:11.440]  Well, I'm running
[23:11.440 --> 23:12.760]  out of space pretty quick here.
[23:13.380 --> 23:14.320]  Yeah, you are.
[23:17.520 --> 23:18.040]  Um...
[23:19.500 --> 23:19.980]  Hmm...
[23:19.980 --> 23:21.220]  Pineapple pizza, that's a good name.
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.320]  Solid jump.
[23:29.360 --> 23:29.840]  Thank you.
[23:35.510 --> 23:35.990]  Fuck!
[23:36.110 --> 23:37.850]  Now that gun is getting beaned.
[23:39.250 --> 23:40.730]  Next one I'm going to get it.
[23:42.250 --> 23:44.170]  It's going in the hole.
[23:45.170 --> 23:45.470]  Alright.
[23:46.670 --> 23:48.430]  I'm going to have to put a magnet in my door hole.
[23:50.410 --> 23:50.810]  Uh...
[23:50.810 --> 23:52.750]  Is there a...
[23:52.750 --> 23:53.630]  What do we got going on here?
[23:53.670 --> 23:54.930]  Oh, we got a turret over there.
[23:56.670 --> 23:58.070]  No! Wrong button!
[23:58.550 --> 23:58.950]  Fuck!
[24:00.970 --> 24:01.370]  Shit!
[24:03.790 --> 24:04.790]  God damn it!
[24:05.110 --> 24:05.730]  And I love it.
[24:06.790 --> 24:07.650]  God damn it.
[24:07.690 --> 24:08.690]  Oh man, that's great.
[24:09.690 --> 24:12.290]  Every time Geoff is staring down the barrel of his own weapon.
[24:14.070 --> 24:15.270]  I'm feeling pretty good about this time.
[24:15.270 --> 24:16.750]  Oh yeah?
[24:16.750 --> 24:17.590]  Let's go...
[24:18.510 --> 24:19.230]  350!
[24:20.190 --> 24:22.830]  Let's put some damage into Mr. 350.
[24:23.410 --> 24:24.170]  Uh oh.
[24:24.490 --> 24:25.210]  Freedom?
[24:26.890 --> 24:28.630]  This is bad.
[24:29.270 --> 24:30.250]  Time to liberate you.
[24:32.750 --> 24:35.310]  I got away lightly from that.
[24:35.570 --> 24:36.030]  Holy shit.
[24:36.310 --> 24:36.730]  Yeah, you did.
[24:38.330 --> 24:40.250]  You're still 286.
[24:40.430 --> 24:40.990]  Insane.
[24:40.990 --> 24:42.870]  Yeah, I need to go get more health.
[24:45.170 --> 24:45.590]  Okay.
[24:46.270 --> 24:48.990]  What about a lovely bit of...
[24:50.510 --> 24:50.930]  No!
[24:52.210 --> 24:54.710]  Yeah, I feel like you've been aiming at me a lot.
[24:54.790 --> 24:56.770]  You've been aiming at people you thought were me a lot.
[24:57.010 --> 24:57.690]  Have some carpet.
[24:57.750 --> 24:59.850]  All of that is...
[24:59.850 --> 25:00.190]  Here we go.
[25:01.850 --> 25:02.270]  That's...
[25:02.890 --> 25:03.310]  Oh!
[25:05.790 --> 25:07.970]  That's a lot of carpet!
[25:07.970 --> 25:10.010]  That's a lot of carpet!
[25:11.390 --> 25:11.870]  Oh!
[25:12.610 --> 25:13.990]  That's not even a U-kill!
[25:14.870 --> 25:16.330]  You would still have life.
[25:17.890 --> 25:18.270]  I guess so.
[25:18.270 --> 25:19.170]  If that was Sinktle Bicky.
[25:21.050 --> 25:21.530]  Alright.
[25:22.010 --> 25:23.850]  How are you still alive, Nick?
[25:24.930 --> 25:26.070]  I love it.
[25:26.690 --> 25:28.130]  Alright, is he going to adjust to try and...
[25:28.670 --> 25:29.630]  get in this hole?
[25:31.670 --> 25:32.290]  Damn it!
[25:32.370 --> 25:32.690]  Oh!
[25:33.230 --> 25:33.710]  Uh oh.
[25:33.710 --> 25:34.650]  Oh!
[25:35.050 --> 25:35.850]  Uh oh!
[25:37.550 --> 25:38.750]  My hole got bigger.
[25:39.850 --> 25:41.090]  Nick, I like that.
[25:41.770 --> 25:42.570]  I do too.
[25:43.070 --> 25:44.650]  You know what?
[25:44.970 --> 25:46.070]  How do I get off this gun?
[25:46.570 --> 25:48.070]  How do you feel about a collab?
[25:50.350 --> 25:51.690]  Press A a bunch.
[25:53.070 --> 25:53.490]  What collab?
[25:57.530 --> 25:58.010]  Oh!
[25:58.490 --> 26:00.190]  I didn't know how to use it!
[26:00.190 --> 26:00.850]  No!
[26:04.810 --> 26:06.110]  You saved it!
[26:06.230 --> 26:07.950]  And then spun him back around in there!
[26:08.510 --> 26:10.150]  You absolutely saved that!
[26:10.730 --> 26:12.590]  I realized as I did it...
[26:12.590 --> 26:13.910]  I don't know how this works.
[26:14.510 --> 26:16.190]  I didn't think about...
[26:16.770 --> 26:18.230]  Oh, it's tank? Okay.
[26:20.850 --> 26:21.850]  Oh, man.
[26:23.470 --> 26:24.150]  Oh, shit.
[26:24.590 --> 26:25.550]  That was great.
[26:25.830 --> 26:27.090]  Give me the idiot flag.
[26:27.090 --> 26:28.490]  There's a lot of idiot flags.
[26:28.830 --> 26:29.550]  They're flying.
[26:29.930 --> 26:33.470]  Fly those idiot flags for me!
[26:33.570 --> 26:33.990]  Uh oh.
[26:35.550 --> 26:36.510]  Oh, no.
[26:37.330 --> 26:39.230]  It's coming down somewhere next turn.
[26:40.230 --> 26:40.610]  Oh, no.
[26:42.630 --> 26:43.430]  Oh, no.
[26:43.750 --> 26:44.490]  What does that do?
[26:44.890 --> 26:45.570]  What is it gonna be?
[26:47.630 --> 26:49.230]  That's a lot of idiot flags.
[26:49.610 --> 26:49.870]  Wow.
[26:50.090 --> 26:51.110]  They're all deserved.
[26:52.830 --> 26:54.990]  Oh, that's nice. I got some more health.
[26:56.090 --> 26:56.930]  Have we...
[26:56.930 --> 26:59.010]  Have we announced the idiot flag yet?
[26:59.430 --> 27:00.150]  That we're making that?
[27:00.770 --> 27:02.910]  Not, I think, outside of what's coming.
[27:03.070 --> 27:03.250]  No.
[27:04.670 --> 27:06.710]  Maybe we shouldn't. Let's not then.
[27:07.210 --> 27:07.490]  Yeah.
[27:08.330 --> 27:09.490]  Eric will get mad at us.
[27:10.530 --> 27:11.450]  He's not gonna know.
[27:12.770 --> 27:13.970]  That's true. It's not like he watches us.
[27:14.070 --> 27:15.190]  He doesn't read or watch things.
[27:20.120 --> 27:21.240]  Okay, where am I now?
[27:22.220 --> 27:22.660]  No.
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.040]  On top of the donkey.
[27:24.040 --> 27:24.700]  Yeah.
[27:25.800 --> 27:26.440]  Perfect.
[27:28.560 --> 27:29.920]  There's no pop here.
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.020]  I will...
[27:31.020 --> 27:33.140]  Oh, shit. What am I gonna do?
[27:34.180 --> 27:35.500]  Run out of time.
[27:35.620 --> 27:36.780]  Where is he?
[27:37.120 --> 27:37.340]  No.
[27:40.680 --> 27:41.960]  Uh oh.
[27:42.060 --> 27:43.520]  Uh oh.
[27:43.600 --> 27:43.960]  What's that?
[27:46.060 --> 27:47.440]  Successfully dodged that.
[27:47.620 --> 27:48.080]  Nice.
[27:53.010 --> 27:54.470]  I should've got in that.
[27:56.830 --> 27:57.950]  Oh, another health.
[28:02.750 --> 28:03.270]  Pop.
[28:03.570 --> 28:06.070]  No hard feelings about that whiff you just received there.
[28:07.170 --> 28:07.790]  Uh oh.
[28:08.030 --> 28:08.670]  Feelings are hard.
[28:09.030 --> 28:10.550]  Feelings are hard.
[28:15.160 --> 28:16.060]  Oh, it's a grenade.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.600]  Oh, I want this.
[28:18.180 --> 28:18.400]  Yeah.
[28:19.780 --> 28:20.820]  And then...
[28:22.040 --> 28:22.880]  Aiming it up.
[28:23.220 --> 28:24.440]  What about your wind, though?
[28:24.440 --> 28:25.840]  What about the windage?
[28:26.140 --> 28:26.900]  Oh, that's a good point.
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.020]  I don't think you want to fire it towards me because of wind.
[28:33.740 --> 28:35.420]  Oh, just crafting.
[28:37.060 --> 28:38.180]  Uh oh.
[28:39.000 --> 28:39.560]  Oh!
[28:41.020 --> 28:43.040]  That was so close.
[28:49.540 --> 28:50.660]  So close.
[28:51.340 --> 28:52.820]  Alright, I need to craft something.
[28:52.820 --> 28:56.520]  If I dismantle a biddy.
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.700]  Oh, Andrew.
[28:59.320 --> 29:00.240]  No!
[29:04.510 --> 29:07.070]  Fly those flakes high!
[29:07.890 --> 29:08.950]  Wave them!
[29:09.330 --> 29:10.730]  Wave them around!
[29:13.050 --> 29:13.770]  No!
[29:21.810 --> 29:23.590]  Oh, I'm so good.
[29:24.590 --> 29:25.810]  Oh, shit me.
[29:25.810 --> 29:27.610]  Oh, my god.
[29:31.010 --> 29:32.550]  Oh, what are you doing?
[29:33.570 --> 29:34.470]  What are you doing?
[29:36.390 --> 29:37.010]  No!
[29:39.310 --> 29:40.870]  Trying to reunite you and Nick.
[29:40.870 --> 29:44.630]  Oh, Nick.
[29:44.670 --> 29:45.790]  I'm so sorry.
[29:47.580 --> 29:48.270]  I'm so sorry.
[29:48.370 --> 29:50.730]  It's so unfair that you died and he lived.
[29:51.750 --> 29:52.570]  I lived!
[29:52.570 --> 29:54.510]  You weren't even the intended target.
[29:55.130 --> 29:57.010]  Geoff took Nick out of the whole game.
[29:58.910 --> 30:00.910]  Geoff, I survived there for so long.
[30:00.930 --> 30:01.650]  I'm so sorry.
[30:02.170 --> 30:04.290]  I stood in the same spot for ages.
[30:05.850 --> 30:06.710]  Where are you?
[30:06.790 --> 30:07.490]  Oh, you're all the way...
[30:07.490 --> 30:09.330]  Okay, this is gonna be tough.
[30:09.390 --> 30:10.930]  I'm just gonna have to start shooting a hole.
[30:16.850 --> 30:18.810]  Okay, so you're...
[30:18.810 --> 30:19.770]  None of your business is mine.
[30:21.770 --> 30:23.250]  So I think that's about...
[30:25.090 --> 30:26.470]  I'll eventually punch through.
[30:27.630 --> 30:28.470]  Nobody cares.
[30:31.530 --> 30:34.290]  That's a powerful win.
[30:39.340 --> 30:41.260]  There's only so much I can do here.
[30:43.730 --> 30:46.200]  So much I can do here.
[30:46.200 --> 30:48.400]  Are you gonna run out of airstrikes anytime soon?
[30:49.960 --> 30:50.200]  Nah.
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.160]  Now that doesn't seem right.
[30:53.700 --> 30:54.680]  You're fine.
[30:54.680 --> 30:54.700]  I'm fine.
[30:55.440 --> 30:56.740]  This isn't gonna do shit.
[31:00.020 --> 31:06.410]  Oh, I know what I can do.
[31:08.290 --> 31:09.470]  Ooh, some health.
[31:12.990 --> 31:14.070]  Oh, shit.
[31:15.510 --> 31:16.750]  Okay, let's see.
[31:17.990 --> 31:19.810]  Do I have any more jetpacks? No.
[31:20.590 --> 31:22.130]  No, I don't.
[31:22.870 --> 31:24.110]  Can I rope over?
[31:24.110 --> 31:25.330]  Oh, definitely rope.
[31:25.670 --> 31:26.950]  Rope your way home.
[31:27.270 --> 31:29.830]  Go a little lower.
[31:30.490 --> 31:32.010]  First, that's an easy jump to make.
[31:32.110 --> 31:33.330]  You don't even need the rope for that.
[31:33.630 --> 31:35.910]  You got it. Let it out a little bit.
[31:36.070 --> 31:36.770]  There you go.
[31:37.350 --> 31:38.710]  Don't be scared of the water.
[31:39.170 --> 31:40.430]  There you go.
[31:40.770 --> 31:43.070]  Thank God. More health for you.
[31:43.270 --> 31:45.170]  That is some of the best roping.
[31:45.550 --> 31:46.470]  Can I let go, though?
[31:46.830 --> 31:48.450]  I think you probably can.
[31:54.870 --> 31:55.830]  Got confused.
[32:00.130 --> 32:02.230]  I teased the water with my tip
[32:02.230 --> 32:03.090]  while I was on that rope.
[32:04.690 --> 32:06.370]  Your tip? You were in the water.
[32:11.350 --> 32:12.710]  It was slowing you down,
[32:12.750 --> 32:13.530]  how deep you were.
[32:14.550 --> 32:15.890]  Okay, now I just
[32:19.310 --> 32:20.570]  give myself a little
[32:23.450 --> 32:25.350]  opportunity to get out.
[32:25.490 --> 32:26.110]  Oh, I like this.
[32:26.110 --> 32:27.810]  Making a little attack hole.
[32:28.250 --> 32:28.890]  Interesting.
[32:30.630 --> 32:31.910]  Very interesting.
[32:32.810 --> 32:34.710]  Oh, damn it.
[32:35.510 --> 32:35.950]  Out of time.
[32:37.790 --> 32:40.890]  You need some more health.
[32:41.890 --> 32:43.750]  Okay, where are you? You're there.
[32:45.510 --> 32:46.150]  So I could
[32:46.150 --> 32:46.730]  potentially
[32:47.910 --> 32:48.550]  just
[32:50.590 --> 32:51.230]  do
[32:52.430 --> 32:53.070]  this.
[32:54.190 --> 32:55.050]  What are you doing?
[32:57.990 --> 32:58.470]  Oh.
[33:00.950 --> 33:01.430]  That'll
[33:01.430 --> 33:01.950]  make you move.
[33:10.600 --> 33:11.760]  Gavin, what's that one's name?
[33:12.760 --> 33:13.240]  Milfstain.
[33:16.180 --> 33:18.020]  You think the stain or the milf got it?
[33:19.900 --> 33:20.900]  I think milf.
[33:21.540 --> 33:21.980]  Yeah, probably.
[33:25.780 --> 33:26.160]  Alright.
[33:26.900 --> 33:28.000]  Or maybe the combo.
[33:36.950 --> 33:37.830]  Uh-oh.
[33:38.230 --> 33:38.610]  What's this about?
[33:39.350 --> 33:40.110]  What are you doing here?
[33:42.050 --> 33:42.870]  Gonna shoot
[33:42.870 --> 33:43.850]  the cliff?
[33:44.830 --> 33:46.570]  You let the clock run a little bit, Geoff.
[33:48.790 --> 33:49.230]  Oh.
[33:50.370 --> 33:52.930]  No, no. Geoff, you gotta
[33:52.930 --> 33:53.490]  get out of there.
[33:54.270 --> 33:55.410]  I threw him in.
[33:56.950 --> 33:57.810]  It's ready for it.
[33:58.390 --> 33:59.490]  It's ready for it.
[34:07.470 --> 34:08.910]  He dodged it.
[34:09.290 --> 34:10.270]  Oh no, more fire.
[34:11.150 --> 34:12.270]  I'm gonna get you.
[34:14.690 --> 34:16.470]  You got so lucky.
[34:17.610 --> 34:18.750]  It's a bad wind.
[34:20.850 --> 34:22.610]  I got an attack pass, though.
[34:23.910 --> 34:24.310]  Okay.
[34:25.330 --> 34:25.970]  I think.
[34:26.570 --> 34:28.130]  Prank-a-leg sphinctal bicky.
[34:29.450 --> 34:31.350]  I think that's more health to get.
[34:32.490 --> 34:33.390]  What's a
[34:33.390 --> 34:34.990]  bicky? A little biscuit.
[34:34.990 --> 34:36.050]  Oh.
[34:37.090 --> 34:38.470]  An anal biscuit?
[34:38.910 --> 34:39.290]  Biscuit?
[34:40.190 --> 34:41.330]  Come on.
[34:42.270 --> 34:44.450]  You are so good with those ropes.
[34:44.610 --> 34:45.630]  I'm always so impressed.
[34:46.190 --> 34:48.690]  Just keep roping more.
[34:50.270 --> 34:50.770]  Wow.
[34:50.990 --> 34:52.570]  Holy shit.
[34:54.650 --> 34:55.410]  Well.
[34:58.050 --> 34:59.310]  I'm freaking out.
[34:59.690 --> 35:01.150]  This is like Mission Impossible 2.
[35:01.710 --> 35:03.210]  You're stressing me out.
[35:05.130 --> 35:06.050]  Oh, good dig.
[35:06.410 --> 35:09.210]  Good smart dig.
[35:10.450 --> 35:12.890]  The water is about to come up. I had to get out of there.
[35:12.970 --> 35:13.310]  Yeah.
[35:25.190 --> 35:27.270]  I can't believe I didn't
[35:27.270 --> 35:28.910]  waste a single rope for this game.
[35:30.470 --> 35:31.570]  Except for that sheep rope.
[35:32.150 --> 35:32.450]  Same.
[35:34.030 --> 35:35.270]  Almost sounds like me
[35:35.270 --> 35:36.590]  with the CPAP mask on.
[35:37.190 --> 35:37.590]  Alarm.
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.860]  I'm curious to see what
[35:42.860 --> 35:43.520]  you're
[35:45.000 --> 35:45.400]  thinking.
[35:47.880 --> 35:48.760]  I'm thinking about killing
[35:48.760 --> 35:49.080]  Gavin.
[35:51.300 --> 35:52.340]  Wait, what are you doing?
[35:52.440 --> 35:52.920]  What are you using?
[35:54.660 --> 35:55.840]  You've got 11 seconds, Geoff.
[35:57.180 --> 35:57.980]  That's tricky.
[35:58.300 --> 35:59.440]  He's going to hit the cliff, surely.
[36:00.020 --> 36:00.460]  Damn it.
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.640]  Let's open the window and pull it over.
[36:05.820 --> 36:07.120]  I need to get some height
[36:07.120 --> 36:07.820]  with this other worm.
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.040]  Oh, this is bad.
[36:11.160 --> 36:11.860]  Do you have any ropes left?
[36:12.760 --> 36:13.240]  No.
[36:15.780 --> 36:18.920]  Oh, a dodgy
[36:18.920 --> 36:20.560]  phone battery. Can I throw that up?
[36:21.980 --> 36:22.960]  That could work.
[36:30.510 --> 36:31.470]  Wrong button?
[36:32.550 --> 36:33.510]  I was trying to jump.
[36:37.410 --> 36:37.670]  Damn it.
[36:37.770 --> 36:41.170]  You've got a nice cave to wait it out in.
[36:44.960 --> 36:46.960]  Nick and I drifted out for so long.
[36:47.500 --> 36:48.660]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[36:49.060 --> 36:50.540]  I've been enjoying watching, though.
[36:50.660 --> 36:51.820]  I'm having a good time.
[36:52.380 --> 36:54.100]  I got my messaging out. It's okay.
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.620]  He's still got banana?
[36:56.680 --> 36:57.300]  Uh-oh.
[36:58.940 --> 37:00.020]  That's a good trajectory.
[37:00.400 --> 37:01.240]  That's going to hit the cliff.
[37:02.600 --> 37:03.080]  Geoff!
[37:04.300 --> 37:04.780]  No!
[37:09.060 --> 37:09.960]  Oh, man.
[37:10.340 --> 37:11.220]  Oh, my God.
[37:13.820 --> 37:15.460]  What can I do?
[37:16.220 --> 37:17.220]  What can I do?
[37:28.630 --> 37:30.710]  Can I just plop this here?
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.260]  It's going to go straight down.
[37:37.500 --> 37:39.080]  I suck. I'm an idiot.
[37:39.600 --> 37:40.940]  I suck.
[37:42.080 --> 37:42.680]  Moron!
[37:43.320 --> 37:44.540]  You're still alive!
[37:44.540 --> 37:45.700]  Oh, you lived!
[37:46.920 --> 37:48.580]  What if the ground he was standing on
[37:48.580 --> 37:49.180]  just fell?
[37:50.200 --> 37:51.720]  And you took off the ledge?
[37:53.540 --> 37:54.580]  That whole island
[37:54.580 --> 37:56.040]  starts floating away off red.
[37:58.760 --> 38:00.600]  I gave you a little shoot-hole.
[38:05.270 --> 38:08.970]  Uh, let's see.
[38:09.790 --> 38:10.650]  Try this again.
[38:11.230 --> 38:12.250]  A little bit less beans.
[38:21.590 --> 38:22.650]  What is that going to do?
[38:24.410 --> 38:25.430]  Hopefully work.
[38:26.690 --> 38:28.230]  Oh, that's nice, Geoff.
[38:28.750 --> 38:29.350]  Oh!
[38:30.550 --> 38:32.790]  That was so good.
[38:35.390 --> 38:38.730]  Geoff, what a shot.
[38:39.150 --> 38:40.770]  Gavin has one worm left,
[38:40.910 --> 38:43.290]  and it's more than half of the full worm so far.
[38:44.090 --> 38:44.550]  Yeah.
[38:45.970 --> 38:47.710]  He's nearly got four worms
[38:47.710 --> 38:48.450]  in that one worm.
[38:50.710 --> 38:51.610]  How am I...
[38:53.250 --> 38:55.230]  I got nothing left
[38:55.230 --> 38:56.570]  to hit you with.
[38:57.270 --> 38:58.970]  I guess while I've still got some time,
[38:59.130 --> 38:59.730]  I could just
[39:00.410 --> 39:01.490]  try for one of these.
[39:01.710 --> 39:03.410]  Oh, that would be crazy.
[39:04.670 --> 39:06.250]  Oh, that's dangerous.
[39:06.350 --> 39:08.230]  Can't make anything useful.
[39:09.750 --> 39:11.830]  I feel like getting back in that little hole
[39:11.830 --> 39:12.510]  is going to be tricky.
[39:19.710 --> 39:20.150]  Oh!
[39:20.290 --> 39:22.230]  That was incredible, Gavin.
[39:22.230 --> 39:23.010]  Oh my god.
[39:23.010 --> 39:24.550]  That was so good.
[39:26.250 --> 39:26.690]  Great shot.
[39:26.690 --> 39:29.850]  Oh, if it snipped behind him and through him, that would have been incredible.
[39:32.230 --> 39:33.810]  This is getting good.
[39:35.350 --> 39:36.230]  This is tactical.
[39:36.570 --> 39:38.090]  I'm screwed, though, with height.
[39:38.810 --> 39:39.530]  It is a problem.
[39:39.730 --> 39:41.750]  I really don't know what else to do.
[39:42.230 --> 39:43.310]  You could parachute down.
[39:44.250 --> 39:45.410]  Oh, could I?
[39:45.790 --> 39:47.930]  Oh, that's an idea. I hadn't thought about that.
[39:48.930 --> 39:49.790]  Oh, that's cool.
[39:49.790 --> 39:52.130]  What other great ideas for me do you have?
[39:52.610 --> 39:53.010]  Swing over.
[39:53.510 --> 39:54.170]  Get a helicopter.
[39:55.570 --> 39:55.850]  Yeah.
[39:57.130 --> 39:59.370]  I could do this.
[40:00.710 --> 40:02.170]  Like gravity takeover.
[40:03.430 --> 40:05.690]  Oh, he's going to time you out. He's waiting.
[40:07.650 --> 40:08.730]  Skipping the turn, huh?
[40:08.770 --> 40:09.670]  The water rises.
[40:11.790 --> 40:13.030]  You're going to actually skip?
[40:13.810 --> 40:14.850]  He didn't.
[40:15.350 --> 40:16.270]  He just jumped.
[40:16.270 --> 40:18.370]  I just wanted you to see it.
[40:18.710 --> 40:19.050]  Skip and jump.
[40:20.390 --> 40:21.730]  Gotta work on my calisthenics.
[40:23.430 --> 40:23.790]  Okay.
[40:25.130 --> 40:25.490]  This...
[40:25.490 --> 40:27.030]  Oh, I can't even get back into my hole.
[40:27.350 --> 40:29.650]  That was what I was saying. I think that's a tough jump.
[40:31.570 --> 40:31.930]  Okay.
[40:32.670 --> 40:33.630]  Oh, he got it.
[40:33.630 --> 40:34.250]  Oh, good jump.
[40:35.970 --> 40:36.690]  That's disappointing.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.240]  I'm coming back.
[40:41.560 --> 40:42.120]  I'm coming up.
[40:42.300 --> 40:43.780]  Oh, you still have a torch. That's great.
[40:45.380 --> 40:47.020]  The tension rises
[40:47.020 --> 40:48.140]  as the water does.
[40:56.940 --> 40:57.380]  Alright.
[41:00.040 --> 41:01.980]  Can I get that health?
[41:13.360 --> 41:15.020]  Clipped the...
[41:15.020 --> 41:17.240]  Clipped the turret there.
[41:18.900 --> 41:19.860]  With my flamethrower.
[41:22.540 --> 41:23.520]  I've got one more.
[41:23.520 --> 41:25.540]  A couple of idiot flags in the chat right now
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.240]  for some reason.
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.080]  I just need to get to this other hole.
[41:30.520 --> 41:31.360]  Ah, yes.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.320]  Make it.
[41:33.540 --> 41:33.880]  Make it.
[41:34.320 --> 41:35.280]  Oh, no!
[41:38.940 --> 41:40.960]  It's like Gavin and I are having a suck-off.
[41:44.140 --> 41:47.580]  I can hide back in my fucking hole away from the world.
[41:49.180 --> 41:50.680]  What else can I do?
[41:56.420 --> 41:56.760]  Let's see.
[41:59.440 --> 42:02.520]  Let's do a speed round. I'll probably turn the game timer down a little.
[42:03.940 --> 42:05.760]  Just start to clear out his world.
[42:06.100 --> 42:06.880]  A little bit over there.
[42:08.060 --> 42:09.400]  Right in the fucking water.
[42:11.340 --> 42:12.240]  Let's follow that.
[42:12.520 --> 42:13.100]  And there he goes.
[42:19.300 --> 42:20.760]  There's gotta be a better way.
[42:20.960 --> 42:21.740]  There has to be.
[42:22.000 --> 42:23.020]  Surely there is.
[42:24.140 --> 42:24.860]  Maybe if you
[42:24.860 --> 42:27.320]  throw a grenade in there, Gavin, and took a step back.
[42:27.460 --> 42:29.120]  I wish there was something I could build.
[42:29.300 --> 42:30.800]  I mean, I could just airstrike him to death.
[42:30.840 --> 42:32.260]  It just seems...
[42:32.260 --> 42:35.180]  No, no, no. I meant you could blow out the end of the tunnel.
[42:35.580 --> 42:36.980]  Drop a grenade, run away.
[42:37.220 --> 42:37.920]  Yeah, I'll blow it out.
[42:38.860 --> 42:39.040]  Yeah.
[42:44.420 --> 42:44.780]  Start.
[42:49.100 --> 42:49.460]  Brilliant.
[42:56.540 --> 42:59.220]  Why weren't you two playing like this when Nick and I were alive?
[42:59.600 --> 43:00.320]  Yeah, what's going on?
[43:00.320 --> 43:02.400]  Why did this start after you killed us all?
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.380]  It just became tense.
[43:04.880 --> 43:06.540]  And I can't get up there.
[43:08.480 --> 43:09.360]  Oh, Christ.
[43:11.620 --> 43:12.500]  Jump around.
[43:13.480 --> 43:14.200]  Oh, no.
[43:14.560 --> 43:16.120]  I just want to get to that hell.
[43:19.200 --> 43:20.020]  There you go.
[43:20.160 --> 43:21.240]  Oh, you're so close.
[43:22.160 --> 43:22.980]  Be careful.
[43:22.980 --> 43:23.300]  Be careful.
[43:28.440 --> 43:30.560]  The not winning with an airstrike
[43:30.560 --> 43:32.360]  is a historic Honor Rules
[43:33.200 --> 43:34.000]  system.
[43:39.590 --> 43:40.970]  Let's see what happens.
[43:41.590 --> 43:42.010]  Hallelujah.
[43:53.930 --> 43:55.910]  Clear in space.
[44:00.250 --> 44:00.410]  Alright.
[44:04.850 --> 44:06.630]  JMaxx said Honor Rules that only Gavin follows.
[44:06.870 --> 44:07.290]  That's... yeah.
[44:08.370 --> 44:09.510]  You know what? It's fair.
[44:11.430 --> 44:12.430]  Alright. I'm out.
[44:12.810 --> 44:13.490]  I'm free.
[44:15.030 --> 44:15.610]  Am I?
[44:15.790 --> 44:17.130]  Jump straight in the water.
[44:19.630 --> 44:20.470]  You got this.
[44:22.950 --> 44:24.350]  There's a little bit of...
[44:24.350 --> 44:25.850]  Oh, yeah. There's some texture.
[44:26.370 --> 44:28.090]  Oh, you can't fit through!
[44:28.090 --> 44:29.530]  I'm too big.
[44:29.770 --> 44:31.750]  I'm a little too small.
[44:32.230 --> 44:33.770]  Blow it again, Gavin.
[44:38.190 --> 44:39.230]  Well, that...
[44:41.470 --> 44:42.870]  Get me out of here.
[44:44.890 --> 44:46.630]  You're in a pair of balls now.
[44:46.890 --> 44:48.090]  Those are perfect balls.
[44:49.750 --> 44:51.090]  You got to make a shaft.
[44:56.100 --> 44:56.620]  No.
[45:05.910 --> 45:07.430]  God damn it. Iron.
[45:09.830 --> 45:10.870]  Oh, that mine.
[45:11.710 --> 45:12.830]  That's a vehicle mine.
[45:13.270 --> 45:13.590]  Vehicle mine?
[45:14.730 --> 45:15.190]  What?
[45:16.990 --> 45:17.770]  It blew up, Geoff.
[45:18.090 --> 45:18.970]  Yeah, it's fine. I'm just kidding.
[45:21.930 --> 45:22.830]  Gavin's crafting.
[45:23.210 --> 45:23.670]  Crafting.
[45:25.250 --> 45:26.210]  Crafty Gavin.
[45:26.750 --> 45:28.190]  Guess who else can craft now?
[45:31.050 --> 45:33.510]  You can't craft in your turn.
[45:34.090 --> 45:34.470]  No, I know.
[45:34.870 --> 45:35.810]  But I can craft now.
[45:35.810 --> 45:37.430]  Now you can, yes.
[45:43.050 --> 45:44.490]  What did he build?
[45:44.810 --> 45:45.970]  I didn't get anything good.
[45:46.250 --> 45:49.850]  I just realized I crafted stuff that's not in the weapon set.
[45:50.810 --> 45:51.730]  Oh, no, it is.
[45:51.770 --> 45:52.090]  It's good.
[45:54.490 --> 45:55.010]  Okay.
[45:56.550 --> 45:58.090]  Alright, this is a two-stage plan.
[45:58.490 --> 45:58.570]  Alright?
[45:59.730 --> 46:00.390]  Stage one.
[46:02.190 --> 46:02.950]  Blow hole.
[46:05.810 --> 46:06.470]  Alright.
[46:07.530 --> 46:08.390]  We're good.
[46:11.890 --> 46:13.490]  Stage two.
[46:16.790 --> 46:17.870]  More supplies, Geoff.
[46:27.830 --> 46:29.290]  You had a jetpack
[46:29.290 --> 46:29.990]  the whole time?
[46:31.450 --> 46:32.250]  Yeah.
[46:32.730 --> 46:34.470]  I thought you were going to come and kill me.
[46:39.310 --> 46:40.650]  He's getting cozy.
[46:41.870 --> 46:42.810]  Nice little hole.
[46:42.830 --> 46:44.630]  You could have just come and killed me at any point.
[46:44.810 --> 46:45.930]  Uh-oh, he's got two.
[46:46.490 --> 46:48.410]  Yeah, I'm not done. I got other jetpacks.
[46:49.430 --> 46:50.330]  Oh, no.
[46:51.030 --> 46:51.850]  You're not moving.
[46:52.130 --> 46:52.570]  Fourteen.
[46:55.330 --> 46:55.810]  Oh, Geoff.
[46:59.510 --> 46:59.970]  Geoff.
[47:00.790 --> 47:01.630]  Bye, Geoff.
[47:02.650 --> 47:03.110]  Geoff!
[47:07.170 --> 47:08.090]  Oh, no.
[47:08.090 --> 47:10.130]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[47:10.330 --> 47:11.210]  Oh, no, Geoff.
[47:13.290 --> 47:15.490]  Gavin, was this part of your stage two plan?
[47:15.910 --> 47:18.090]  That could have gone better.
[47:19.170 --> 47:20.110]  That could have gone better.
[47:20.410 --> 47:20.750]  Oh, no.
[47:21.770 --> 47:23.970]  The idiot flags are flying.
[47:24.450 --> 47:25.110]  It could have gone better.
[47:25.870 --> 47:27.310]  Oh, I wonder if... I'll tell you what.
[47:27.410 --> 47:28.950]  I wonder if a sheep could make that gap.
[47:29.590 --> 47:29.850]  Oh.
[47:31.510 --> 47:32.850]  I want to see.
[47:33.710 --> 47:36.450]  It's so funny that he's just surviving on a donkey face.
[47:37.290 --> 47:38.610]  Sheep of victory!
[47:40.790 --> 47:41.990]  Go, go.
[47:42.610 --> 47:43.590]  He got me.
[47:43.950 --> 47:44.250]  Yes!
[47:46.690 --> 47:48.150]  You did it!
[47:48.190 --> 47:49.790]  Gavin with the win.
[47:50.330 --> 47:51.950]  That was a long game of worms.
[47:52.130 --> 47:54.270]  That was really...
[47:54.270 --> 47:56.450]  Two expert tacticians
[47:56.970 --> 47:58.490]  at the top of their game
[47:58.490 --> 47:59.890]  battling it out.
[48:00.410 --> 48:01.910]  Wits and strategy.
[48:02.650 --> 48:02.750]  Wow.
[48:02.750 --> 48:04.410]  Winston Churchill
[48:04.410 --> 48:05.730]  versus Sun Tzu.
[48:05.950 --> 48:07.330]  It's a battle of legends.
[48:11.770 --> 48:13.210]  Oh, man.
[48:14.170 --> 48:14.570]  Alright.
[48:15.010 --> 48:15.950]  Let's do one more.
[48:16.630 --> 48:18.070]  Accelerated or something, you said?
[48:18.790 --> 48:20.590]  Yeah, I'll just turn on the
[48:20.590 --> 48:21.650]  game timer.
[48:22.690 --> 48:23.150]  Sweet.
[48:23.710 --> 48:23.850]  Alright.
[48:25.150 --> 48:27.490]  We're going to at least 5-0-1.
[48:28.150 --> 48:28.770]  At least.
[48:30.650 --> 48:31.010]  Obviously.
[48:31.010 --> 48:32.290]  Turn time is fine.
[48:32.410 --> 48:33.930]  Let's do round time.
[48:35.830 --> 48:36.390]  Half.
[48:36.650 --> 48:37.210]  Oh!
[48:43.120 --> 48:44.000]  What map?
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.580]  Let's change the scheme.
[48:47.720 --> 48:48.280]  Scheme.
[48:48.660 --> 48:50.780]  Make it a little bit London-y.
[48:51.060 --> 48:52.240]  Oh, that's a bit snowy.
[48:52.580 --> 48:53.420]  That's a bit snowy.
[48:53.680 --> 48:55.160]  I don't want there to be a roof.
[48:55.960 --> 48:56.740]  No, no roof.
[48:57.700 --> 48:58.260]  Yes!
[48:58.260 --> 48:58.980]  You feel that?
[49:00.100 --> 49:01.160]  Yeah, me like.
[49:06.980 --> 49:07.380]  Andrew?
[49:07.960 --> 49:09.080]  Oh, sorry about that.
[49:10.100 --> 49:11.580]  I readied up and I thought it was good.
[49:12.140 --> 49:12.840]  I was looking at the chat.
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.660]  I think it unreadies you if I change something.
[49:15.100 --> 49:15.460]  Got it.
[49:17.120 --> 49:18.160]  Alright, here we go.
[49:18.540 --> 49:19.720]  This is it. Speed round.
[49:19.940 --> 49:20.920]  Best of luck, everybody.
[49:22.280 --> 49:23.080]  Good luck.
[49:25.400 --> 49:26.200]  Very close.
[49:26.480 --> 49:28.740]  Best time of the day.
[49:28.740 --> 49:29.800]  Week.
[49:30.440 --> 49:31.960]  Oh, this is a small map.
[49:32.080 --> 49:33.120]  Holy shit.
[49:33.120 --> 49:34.520]  Oh, this is a little baby map.
[49:34.520 --> 49:37.720]  Oh, no! Stop your fire!
[49:38.120 --> 49:38.320]  Uh-oh!
[49:39.860 --> 49:40.540]  Everybody!
[49:43.800 --> 49:44.940]  What's up, y'all?
[49:45.040 --> 49:45.400]  Uh-oh.
[49:47.360 --> 49:49.120]  I did shot myself.
[49:50.160 --> 49:50.940]  Peppered everyone.
[49:54.040 --> 49:54.720]  Okay.
[49:55.560 --> 49:56.240]  Indiscriminate.
[49:57.120 --> 49:58.080]  Good old
[49:58.080 --> 49:59.040]  track slam.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.180]  Let's see what's going on
[50:02.180 --> 50:03.100]  over here.
[50:04.720 --> 50:05.920]  Thank you so much,
[50:06.020 --> 50:07.220]  Mr. Sistafista.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.320]  This turn's dedicated to you.
[50:12.020 --> 50:12.720]  Oops.
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.480]  Did you waste that? Yeah.
[50:19.980 --> 50:20.680]  Okay.
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.820]  Careful now.
[50:28.120 --> 50:28.860]  Oh, God.
[50:31.660 --> 50:32.620]  My ears!
[50:34.440 --> 50:35.420]  Oh, seven?
[50:36.560 --> 50:37.340]  Oh, you hit
[50:37.340 --> 50:37.800]  snap.
[50:38.980 --> 50:41.300]  Reliant B, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[50:41.560 --> 50:42.400]  Oh, thank you so much.
[50:43.600 --> 50:44.080]  What?
[50:48.580 --> 50:50.140]  Let's see what we have over here.
[50:50.260 --> 50:51.100]  Yeah, what do we have?
[50:51.500 --> 50:52.780]  What we got, Geoff?
[50:52.780 --> 50:54.520]  What do we have? Let's see.
[50:55.260 --> 50:56.200]  Let's see.
[50:56.500 --> 50:57.600]  I'm crafting something fun.
[50:58.440 --> 50:59.420]  Oh, yeah? Yeah.
[51:03.520 --> 51:05.320]  Yeah, fuck him up over there.
[51:05.780 --> 51:06.560]  Where's that going?
[51:07.100 --> 51:08.680]  Extra beans. Too much mustard.
[51:09.560 --> 51:10.780]  What was that? Whoops.
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.800]  Nothing. Don't worry about it.
[51:12.860 --> 51:14.500]  You really can have too much mustard.
[51:15.160 --> 51:15.680]  Yeah.
[51:17.600 --> 51:18.720]  That was disappointing.
[51:21.740 --> 51:23.020]  Okay, there goes the health.
[51:25.660 --> 51:26.140]  Clowning.
[51:27.940 --> 51:28.840]  Go see.
[51:31.780 --> 51:33.220]  Andrew's a roll on the edge.
[51:33.900 --> 51:34.660]  They really are.
[51:35.800 --> 51:37.380]  Emily asked me what movies
[51:37.380 --> 51:39.420]  I got in the draft, and I was like,
[51:39.540 --> 51:41.520]  you know, I couldn't fucking tell you.
[51:42.480 --> 51:43.300]  I really
[51:43.300 --> 51:43.760]  don't know.
[51:44.640 --> 51:47.040]  Oh, the fickle tickle pickle with five gifted subs.
[51:47.220 --> 51:48.840]  Thank you very much. Nice name.
[51:49.760 --> 51:51.080]  By the way, find out how we did on
[51:51.680 --> 51:52.160]  Sunday?
[51:53.620 --> 51:54.140]  Yeah.
[51:54.640 --> 51:55.280]  On a weekend day.
[51:56.320 --> 51:57.520]  One of these weekend days.
[51:58.060 --> 51:59.360]  What's going on in there?
[52:00.520 --> 52:01.880]  That's the suck-off room.
[52:03.400 --> 52:04.100]  What the?
[52:05.240 --> 52:05.700]  Oh.
[52:06.540 --> 52:07.040]  What'd you do?
[52:07.540 --> 52:08.760]  He put a turret in there.
[52:11.920 --> 52:12.440]  Beware
[52:12.440 --> 52:13.400]  entering this building.
[52:20.170 --> 52:21.010]  Kai13, thanks
[52:21.010 --> 52:21.930]  for the five gifted subs.
[52:21.930 --> 52:23.490]  Thank you so much.
[52:24.750 --> 52:26.110]  What's a baller move?
[52:26.770 --> 52:27.150]  Oh no.
[52:27.330 --> 52:28.470]  Oh no.
[52:30.610 --> 52:31.470]  Let's see.
[52:31.630 --> 52:32.950]  I like what you're thinking here, Geoff.
[52:34.410 --> 52:35.430]  Oh, he's got a second.
[52:35.930 --> 52:36.190]  Whoops.
[52:38.350 --> 52:39.410]  Overshot that a bit.
[52:40.850 --> 52:41.650]  You both
[52:41.650 --> 52:43.030]  under and overshot it.
[52:43.090 --> 52:45.550]  You covered both bases.
[52:45.730 --> 52:46.770]  You're narrowing it in.
[52:47.070 --> 52:48.570]  Not a different splitter, that Geoff.
[52:51.930 --> 52:52.570]  I'm stuck.
[52:53.530 --> 52:55.930]  I can't be in this because it's on a freaking vehicle
[52:55.930 --> 52:56.230]  mine.
[52:56.790 --> 52:57.510]  You'll have to
[52:59.530 --> 53:01.050]  drop a holy hand grenade on yourself.
[53:01.630 --> 53:03.310]  Yeah, that's probably your best bet.
[53:04.190 --> 53:05.870]  Wait, no, I'm right there.
[53:05.910 --> 53:06.270]  Don't do that.
[53:06.430 --> 53:08.510]  I think I'll do a dodgy phone.
[53:10.370 --> 53:11.270]  What's a dodgy phone do?
[53:11.650 --> 53:13.950]  I think it does the chain reaction electric thing.
[53:16.890 --> 53:17.530]  Please don't.
[53:18.390 --> 53:19.550]  Oh god, is that going to come my way?
[53:19.550 --> 53:19.710]  Oh.
[53:21.150 --> 53:22.030]  I hope so.
[53:23.450 --> 53:25.270]  Went the wrong way. Excellent.
[53:26.030 --> 53:27.910]  Oh, it hurt though. It hurt real bad.
[53:28.350 --> 53:28.730]  Damn it.
[53:29.790 --> 53:30.210]  Wow.
[53:34.440 --> 53:36.580]  Thank you so much SFSbox2
[53:36.580 --> 53:38.500]  and BecausePotatoes for subscribing.
[53:40.100 --> 53:41.040]  BecausePotatoes without an E.
[53:42.100 --> 53:42.580]  BecausePotatoes.
[53:43.020 --> 53:44.240]  Wait, does Potatoes have an E?
[53:45.580 --> 53:46.660]  Potatoes has an E.
[53:48.280 --> 53:48.760]  Potatoes.
[53:48.760 --> 53:49.300]  Potatoes.
[53:49.560 --> 53:50.260]  Potatoes.
[53:52.550 --> 53:52.900]  Potatoes.
[53:55.500 --> 53:56.900]  Oh shit.
[53:57.440 --> 53:57.860]  Oh shit.
[53:59.680 --> 54:01.820]  Kodiak's Law with 10 gifted subs.
[54:02.520 --> 54:02.920]  Oh my god.
[54:03.300 --> 54:03.760]  Thank you.
[54:04.460 --> 54:05.680]  Very generous.
[54:06.380 --> 54:09.740]  Listen, we've learned some things.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.100]  We're going to find out what happened.
[54:13.480 --> 54:13.920]  Oh dear.
[54:15.380 --> 54:16.300]  You're right.
[54:16.300 --> 54:17.920]  Don't worry.
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.180]  Oh dear.
[54:19.500 --> 54:21.580]  For everybody.
[54:22.680 --> 54:23.780]  But especially me.
[54:28.660 --> 54:29.580]  Cornfield's really
[54:29.580 --> 54:30.460]  in a sticky situation.
[54:31.720 --> 54:33.280]  Let's get in this.
[54:34.060 --> 54:35.320]  Clown in a helicopter.
[54:36.700 --> 54:37.980]  Looking good.
[54:38.720 --> 54:39.320]  Come on.
[54:39.960 --> 54:40.760]  He's trying to get that health.
[54:41.360 --> 54:41.840]  Get that health.
[54:42.340 --> 54:44.200]  Oh okay.
[54:44.880 --> 54:45.240]  Ow.
[54:45.240 --> 54:45.920]  In the chopper.
[54:46.120 --> 54:48.600]  I don't have my license.
[54:52.210 --> 54:53.290]  I only went
[54:53.290 --> 54:55.290]  to clown school.
[54:59.120 --> 55:00.120]  God damn.
[55:00.300 --> 55:00.820]  Where are you going?
[55:01.380 --> 55:03.240]  Oh for god's sake.
[55:04.040 --> 55:04.700]  Fall.
[55:06.080 --> 55:06.260]  Uh oh.
[55:07.860 --> 55:08.520]  Cornfield.
[55:09.140 --> 55:09.800]  Cornfield.
[55:12.200 --> 55:13.140]  Cornfield's dead.
[55:13.500 --> 55:14.280]  You killed Cornfield.
[55:15.120 --> 55:17.460]  No. I killed Cornfield.
[55:17.460 --> 55:19.480]  You rained fire on him.
[55:19.780 --> 55:20.760]  And he went oh.
[55:21.340 --> 55:22.660]  And then he popped into this.
[55:23.080 --> 55:24.260]  He killed his own twin brother.
[55:24.840 --> 55:25.720]  Oh shit.
[55:26.120 --> 55:28.280]  That ghosty.
[55:32.600 --> 55:33.240]  Jeez.
[55:33.940 --> 55:34.980]  What a freaking turn.
[55:36.740 --> 55:38.080]  That was a lot.
[55:38.600 --> 55:38.920]  Yeah.
[55:39.080 --> 55:39.800]  That was a lot.
[55:41.160 --> 55:41.660]  Oh.
[55:44.060 --> 55:46.280]  You blew up your own guy.
[55:52.040 --> 55:53.280]  Kodiak's low with another ten.
[55:53.460 --> 55:54.420]  Good lord.
[55:55.640 --> 55:56.600]  Thank you.
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.260]  Thank you so much Kodiak.
[55:58.340 --> 55:58.980]  Whose turn is it?
[56:02.610 --> 56:03.970]  Was it a black and white sheep?
[56:04.090 --> 56:04.510]  What is that?
[56:06.630 --> 56:08.030]  It's an electric sheep.
[56:08.770 --> 56:10.190]  Didn't seem to do much though.
[56:10.810 --> 56:11.290]  Disappoint.
[56:12.350 --> 56:13.870]  Do androids dream about them?
[56:15.190 --> 56:15.950]  They do.
[56:17.170 --> 56:18.310]  Oh come on Geoff.
[56:20.110 --> 56:21.510]  Are you upset with what it did?
[56:21.510 --> 56:22.410]  Both.
[56:25.670 --> 56:27.590]  I didn't do fucking nothing dude.
[56:27.850 --> 56:30.430]  I wasted a fucking craft on that.
[56:30.990 --> 56:31.830]  Yeah that's rough.
[56:32.390 --> 56:33.170]  Yeah that's pretty rough.
[56:33.350 --> 56:35.170]  I wasted a craft on this.
[56:36.370 --> 56:36.630]  Oh.
[56:37.130 --> 56:39.010]  This is a charged phone battery.
[56:39.870 --> 56:40.190]  Oh.
[56:42.090 --> 56:43.350]  Oh shit though.
[56:43.630 --> 56:44.510]  It didn't move anywhere.
[56:44.950 --> 56:45.970]  I shoved.
[56:48.310 --> 56:48.910]  Moron.
[56:51.970 --> 56:53.890]  I can never aim that the right way.
[56:54.030 --> 56:55.410]  How do you know what direction?
[57:00.810 --> 57:02.490]  Electrocuted two of my worms.
[57:03.750 --> 57:04.670]  Not a good idea.
[57:11.220 --> 57:11.860]  Whoa.
[57:12.860 --> 57:14.440]  That's just unfortunate.
[57:14.880 --> 57:16.200]  Right in my face.
[57:17.240 --> 57:19.260]  Do it to me.
[57:20.240 --> 57:20.840]  Oh.
[57:21.020 --> 57:21.620]  No.
[57:23.940 --> 57:24.840]  Killed me.
[57:25.160 --> 57:25.880]  Oh nine?
[57:26.580 --> 57:27.660]  Come on.
[57:29.220 --> 57:30.360]  Gah no.
[57:34.800 --> 57:35.400]  Okay.
[57:36.160 --> 57:37.340]  Where do I want to move to?
[57:37.440 --> 57:38.580]  Let's get the cover.
[57:39.620 --> 57:41.280]  Let's get a little bit of cover.
[57:41.960 --> 57:42.700]  Oh I like it.
[57:45.580 --> 57:47.440]  There's no way that this could go wrong.
[57:47.440 --> 57:48.300]  Oh.
[57:50.420 --> 57:51.660]  Armageddon.
[57:54.040 --> 57:54.560]  Oh yeah.
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.600]  Oh no.
[57:58.240 --> 57:59.160]  Oh boy.
[58:00.020 --> 58:02.660]  Oh no.
[58:03.280 --> 58:03.720]  No.
[58:07.540 --> 58:10.460]  I've killed all my worms.
[58:13.100 --> 58:15.540]  How did this go against me?
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.080]  You've killed everyone.
[58:19.080 --> 58:20.020]  Did anyone live?
[58:20.960 --> 58:22.700]  I'm completely out.
[58:23.980 --> 58:25.800]  Gavin and I out.
[58:26.080 --> 58:27.900]  You're gonna end the stream before 5.01.
[58:30.980 --> 58:31.700]  Jesus.
[58:31.980 --> 58:32.860]  That's so much damage.
[58:33.700 --> 58:36.040]  I did like two things this game.
[58:36.840 --> 58:38.280]  Just the first one.
[58:40.680 --> 58:41.840]  Holy shit.
[58:44.260 --> 58:45.700]  Good god.
[58:45.700 --> 58:47.060]  Oh dear.
[58:47.620 --> 58:50.000]  We might end on time. Holy shit.
[58:51.900 --> 58:53.880]  What was that Andrew?
[58:54.140 --> 58:56.100]  I was able to craft an Armageddon
[58:56.100 --> 58:56.880]  from those boxes.
[58:57.400 --> 59:00.020]  Usually I limit that to being like a late game
[59:00.020 --> 59:01.880]  craftable but I guess I forgot.
[59:07.720 --> 59:09.300]  Jesus Christ dude.
[59:11.420 --> 59:13.280]  It's so much faster than I remember.
[59:13.280 --> 59:15.560]  How do I get out of this fucking thing?
[59:15.760 --> 59:16.020]  Why?
[59:16.800 --> 59:18.020]  Because I want to get out.
[59:22.760 --> 59:24.260]  But who's on first?
[59:27.200 --> 59:27.960]  Oh wow.
[59:31.960 --> 59:32.740]  Watch this.
[59:32.980 --> 59:33.700]  This is gonna be brilliant.
[59:34.360 --> 59:35.260]  I can't wait.
[59:37.820 --> 59:38.880]  He's going with it.
[59:39.760 --> 59:41.600]  I just didn't quite make it.
[59:41.780 --> 59:42.940]  Holy shit.
[59:45.700 --> 59:46.540]  I lived.
[59:48.680 --> 59:50.220]  How will it end?
[59:51.280 --> 59:52.080]  Slide off the edge Nick.
[59:55.120 --> 59:56.300]  Backblast area all clear.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.860]  From there you're just gonna
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.540]  throw out the tank.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:07.360]  Oh no.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.160]  It's looking nice.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.060]  That was so close.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.080]  Oh.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.520]  You know what?
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.080]  I'll play this game with you Nick.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.980]  Yeah drop it there.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.140]  What about the wind?
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.460]  Wind go.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.880]  Push more.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.040]  Don't blow. Go.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.180]  Push it right.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.120]  Oh boy.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.480]  Very well.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.240]  Oh.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.220]  That makes it
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:42.860]  easier for Nick.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.700]  Will Nick
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.740]  land it in the death bucket?
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.980]  Here comes the death bucket.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.540]  What has he
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.620]  learned from his last throw?
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.960]  He's completely reset his worm, nevermind.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.280]  No, still got it.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:57.640]  Okay.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.240]  It's going up.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.060]  It's looking good.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:02.820]  Oh.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.240]  Oh no.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:06.540]  No.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:08.820]  No.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.540]  It's not enough.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:13.960]  I'm alive.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.800]  Holy shit.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  That's a tough throw
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.560]  for old Geoff down there.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.400]  It's 5-0-1.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.740]  5-0-1.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.580]  Oh man.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.380]  Oh my god.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.740]  Two haggard old worms.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.160]  Oh, that's great.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.200]  That's perfect.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.180]  What a throw, Geoff.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:47.900]  Textbook.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.060]  Incredible.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.300]  That was some great precision
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:56.860]  in this game.
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.700]  That was really good.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:00.440]  What a stream.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.620]  What a stream.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:03.680]  Wow.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.360]  Right at 5-0-1 too.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.760]  Perfect ending.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.140]  Be out on Tuesday
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.800]  as a VOD.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.180]  What a successful little stream
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:14.900]  we had there.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.160]  Is the game just broken?
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:18.880]  Seems like it.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.640]  It can't handle all the damage that Andrew's single turn did.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.280]  Trying to accumulate the stats
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.120]  and it's just struggling.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.500]  It sensed that I won and it doesn't want to finish and give me credit.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.100]  Yeah.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.120]  Well, should we get the fuck out of here now?
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:36.600]  I guess we should wrap up.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.300]  It'll end. Hold on.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.420]  It'll end? Okay.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.260]  We'll wait. Hang out.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.200]  Maybe we won't.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.260]  You sure about that?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.960]  Even when he's gone, Eric won.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.980]  So how's that Blueprints going for the two of you?
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.980]  I haven't played it
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.660]  in the last couple days. I need to get back to it.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.780]  I got sucked into Oblivion.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.960]  Yeah, it's so good.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:00.380]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.280]  But I do need to finish.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.960]  I'm still so mad I bought it on Steam instead of Game Pass
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.940]  that I'm just gonna play it.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.920]  You gotta stop doing that, man.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.580]  That's the second time you've done that.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.120]  I'm a moron.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.160]  In like two weeks, that's the second time you've done that.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.520]  Literally the last two games we've played.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.600]  Alright, sod it.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.260]  Uh...
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.400]  This is...
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.320]  This isn't gonna fix...
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.660]  I don't think it's fixing. I think it's broken.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:29.660]  I think it's done.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.700]  Thank you so much for watching!
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.220]  We will see you next week.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.880]  Same place, same time.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.020]  Different week.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.200]  Bye-bye.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:40.840]  Bye!
