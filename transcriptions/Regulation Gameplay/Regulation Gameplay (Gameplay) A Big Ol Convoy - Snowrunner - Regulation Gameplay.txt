[00:01.090 --> 00:02.690]  Welcome back, it's Trucks.
[00:02.950 --> 00:07.110]  I thought that was a horn, that was like a truck horn, but it wasn't, it was an air horn.
[00:07.510 --> 00:09.370]  Guys, welcome back to Trucks.
[00:10.430 --> 00:14.070]  Dispatch here, it's me, Eric. I'm joined with the big ol' convoy
[00:14.070 --> 00:16.890]  of Andrew, Nick, Geoff, and Gavin.
[00:17.130 --> 00:21.630]  Guys, looks like nobody has trucks, except Andrew, who's sideways in the river.
[00:22.210 --> 00:22.950]  I started here!
[00:23.510 --> 00:24.670]  Geoff is loaning them all out.
[00:24.730 --> 00:25.150]  You did?
[00:25.570 --> 00:27.210]  This is the bridge we were at last time.
[00:27.950 --> 00:33.070]  I put three trucks outside for anybody that wants them.
[00:33.810 --> 00:35.670]  That's a nice looking truck. Which is the best truck?
[00:36.670 --> 00:38.110]  I'm in one already, so...
[00:38.110 --> 00:39.610]  The one that Geoff's in?
[00:40.550 --> 00:43.210]  The one that I'm in, I'm setting up right now, so...
[00:44.230 --> 00:46.030]  What mission do we want to do, fellas?
[00:46.370 --> 00:49.130]  That's a great question, I need to know what kind of truck I need to build myself.
[00:49.890 --> 00:51.170]  What did we do last time?
[00:51.530 --> 00:54.330]  Should we do the most groupist mission, so we're all together?
[00:54.830 --> 00:55.650]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:55.650 --> 00:56.570]  That's a great idea.
[00:56.570 --> 00:56.710]  Is that what we're going to do?
[00:57.590 --> 00:57.950]  Yeah.
[00:58.090 --> 01:00.790]  The groupist mission. Well, I mean, we just do a mission together, right?
[01:00.870 --> 01:03.350]  Like, they're all kind of groupish.
[01:04.490 --> 01:07.290]  I just pissed off on my own for the last few videos.
[01:08.470 --> 01:11.790]  Well, it was that or sit in the mud with us, so...
[01:11.790 --> 01:13.050]  Yeah, they were in the mud.
[01:13.070 --> 01:13.810]  Sitting in the muck.
[01:15.030 --> 01:17.250]  You need to be able to turn... How do you turn the engine off while you're waiting?
[01:18.330 --> 01:20.650]  Up on the function, then stop engine.
[01:21.230 --> 01:22.690]  Up-jump the function, yeah.
[01:22.790 --> 01:23.510]  Oh, the function.
[01:23.590 --> 01:25.390]  Up-jump the function boogie.
[01:25.390 --> 01:26.550]  Up-jump the boogie.
[01:26.770 --> 01:27.430]  Up on the D-pad.
[01:28.290 --> 01:28.930]  Got it.
[01:29.210 --> 01:29.790]  Hip-hop.
[01:29.870 --> 01:31.070]  It will save it fuel, you know.
[01:31.310 --> 01:33.730]  Yeah, I did the same thing as soon as I hopped in this truck.
[01:34.190 --> 01:36.650]  Alright, pick a mission, Andrew, so I know what to do.
[01:36.670 --> 01:39.110]  Yeah, we're doing not a drill. I don't think we finished that one.
[01:39.630 --> 01:42.250]  Alright, what kind of trucks do we need? What do we got going on?
[01:42.490 --> 01:44.170]  We need an oil rig drill.
[01:45.150 --> 01:46.570]  So we need to pull a drill?
[01:47.590 --> 01:49.010]  I think it's at the drilling site.
[01:49.850 --> 01:52.750]  Uh, let me just...
[01:52.750 --> 01:53.130]  Fuck.
[01:53.990 --> 01:54.410]  Let me just...
[01:54.410 --> 01:54.810]  Fuck.
[01:55.670 --> 01:55.890]  Please don't.
[01:57.430 --> 01:57.830]  Oh.
[01:59.130 --> 01:59.910]  What's this thing called again?
[01:59.910 --> 02:00.590]  Did they update this game recently?
[02:01.670 --> 02:02.530]  Their new mechanic?
[02:03.550 --> 02:04.170]  Not a drill.
[02:04.510 --> 02:05.290]  Not a drill.
[02:05.490 --> 02:08.270]  Is that what we're doing? Deliver to the drilling site, oil rig drill.
[02:08.470 --> 02:08.950]  That sounds familiar.
[02:09.510 --> 02:09.990]  And then...
[02:09.990 --> 02:10.690]  I think that's what we're doing.
[02:10.690 --> 02:14.870]  Deliver to the drilling site, custom rigid semi-trailer.
[02:15.070 --> 02:15.530]  That's gonna...
[02:16.070 --> 02:16.510]  Oh, okay.
[02:17.210 --> 02:18.330]  Doesn't really matter what I pick then.
[02:19.350 --> 02:19.750]  So...
[02:19.750 --> 02:21.050]  Where do we get the drill from?
[02:21.370 --> 02:22.250]  The drilling site.
[02:22.350 --> 02:23.430]  Uh, we gotta go to the other map.
[02:23.430 --> 02:25.270]  Gotta go to the other map for that.
[02:25.430 --> 02:26.430]  Oh, it's actually at the drill site.
[02:26.530 --> 02:26.750]  Got it.
[02:27.370 --> 02:28.110]  Who's this?
[02:29.810 --> 02:30.230]  Heyo!
[02:31.050 --> 02:31.530]  Heyo!
[02:31.930 --> 02:32.670]  Who's this?
[02:33.930 --> 02:36.670]  So Andrew is the purple truck.
[02:37.010 --> 02:40.530]  Looks like Nick is, uh...
[02:40.530 --> 02:42.210]  Red-ish? Red-yellow?
[02:44.370 --> 02:44.850]  What?
[02:45.710 --> 02:47.070]  Who's this with the crane on the top?
[02:47.930 --> 02:49.010]  That's Nick, I believe.
[02:49.130 --> 02:49.530]  That's Nick. That's me.
[02:49.810 --> 02:51.030]  I'd go left if I were Nick.
[02:51.030 --> 02:52.450]  You described that as red and yellow?
[02:52.450 --> 02:53.890]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:54.210 --> 02:54.230]  At the front?
[02:54.230 --> 02:56.110]  Like, if I were to say...
[02:56.110 --> 02:59.870]  I would say if one of you were red, it's Gavin, the all-red truck.
[03:00.150 --> 03:01.010]  Let's take a look.
[03:02.350 --> 03:03.370]  But look at my front.
[03:04.550 --> 03:05.370]  You're right, it's black.
[03:05.370 --> 03:07.610]  That's how you would describe your truck?
[03:09.590 --> 03:10.490]  Ass to ass!
[03:12.370 --> 03:16.690]  The oil rig is at Smithville Dam, so we're gonna have to leave the map.
[03:17.170 --> 03:17.290]  Yup.
[03:17.750 --> 03:18.890]  I don't know where Nick is going.
[03:18.890 --> 03:20.050]  Follow that red truck.
[03:20.790 --> 03:22.230]  It's got red markings.
[03:23.810 --> 03:25.930]  Do not follow that red truck!
[03:26.970 --> 03:27.410]  What are we doing?
[03:27.650 --> 03:28.110]  We wanna go left.
[03:28.770 --> 03:29.890]  Alright, well, I'll follow purple.
[03:29.970 --> 03:30.810]  I thought we were going to the drill.
[03:31.010 --> 03:31.390]  Follow purple!
[03:32.570 --> 03:33.850]  We're going to the drilling site, aren't we?
[03:34.270 --> 03:39.810]  No, we gotta go out of the map to get the drill and then deliver it to the drilling site.
[03:40.350 --> 03:43.250]  I need to activate this mission.
[03:44.790 --> 03:45.490]  Do it, dude.
[03:46.010 --> 03:47.570]  Why can't I? What am I stuck on?
[03:47.650 --> 03:48.170]  Where's that at?
[03:48.830 --> 03:50.750]  Go right, bump, go to...
[03:50.750 --> 03:51.370]  Not a drill.
[03:51.830 --> 03:52.390]  Back, and then, yeah.
[03:53.470 --> 03:54.510]  Start tracking.
[03:55.070 --> 03:56.690]  Tracking the shit out of it.
[03:57.170 --> 03:58.750]  What is wrong with my truck?
[03:59.610 --> 04:01.270]  And you guys are gonna go left, you said?
[04:01.270 --> 04:02.490]  Andrew, are you okay?
[04:02.750 --> 04:02.990]  I can't go!
[04:02.990 --> 04:04.650]  We haven't even, like, started yet.
[04:05.070 --> 04:06.510]  What is happening to my truck?
[04:06.870 --> 04:08.130]  Your winch is connected.
[04:08.970 --> 04:10.190]  Disconnect your winch.
[04:10.510 --> 04:11.130]  To where?
[04:11.530 --> 04:12.830]  I don't know.
[04:12.930 --> 04:14.450]  Wherever you connected it.
[04:14.710 --> 04:15.750]  No, it's not connected.
[04:16.790 --> 04:17.970]  It said winch attached.
[04:18.170 --> 04:18.630]  Didn't it?
[04:18.710 --> 04:20.030]  You had to pull me forward.
[04:20.110 --> 04:20.950]  I can't move.
[04:21.750 --> 04:22.110]  What?
[04:22.390 --> 04:23.510]  You want a little bunce?
[04:23.670 --> 04:24.890]  Yeah, give me a little bunce, please.
[04:25.090 --> 04:25.510]  I don't know what's going on.
[04:25.510 --> 04:26.210]  Are you in neutral?
[04:26.630 --> 04:27.570]  Are you in neutral?
[04:28.170 --> 04:30.530]  Are you in neutral?
[04:30.870 --> 04:31.590]  Yeah, I was in neutral.
[04:31.890 --> 04:32.390]  That was it.
[04:33.630 --> 04:35.550]  Eyes in the sky for a reason.
[04:35.730 --> 04:36.390]  Thanks, Eric.
[04:36.730 --> 04:38.070]  I don't know how that happened.
[04:38.590 --> 04:39.450]  I don't know how to drive.
[04:39.670 --> 04:40.170]  This is dispatch.
[04:40.290 --> 04:42.490]  Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?
[04:43.310 --> 04:43.670]  Nope.
[04:44.330 --> 04:45.090]  My car's in park.
[04:45.130 --> 04:45.650]  Why won't it go?
[04:45.810 --> 04:46.290]  Hold on, hold on.
[04:50.350 --> 04:51.710]  Alright, we got a little convoy.
[04:52.750 --> 04:53.570]  Look at us.
[04:56.190 --> 04:57.370]  You're on all the loose rocks.
[04:58.790 --> 05:00.450]  Gotta be careful on the loose rocks.
[05:01.590 --> 05:03.670]  Geoff, I love these tires you've got on this thing.
[05:04.250 --> 05:04.550]  Thanks, man.
[05:04.550 --> 05:05.430]  They look like balls.
[05:06.810 --> 05:10.350]  Well, I knew you were gonna be driving it, so I wanted to decorate it with your favorite things.
[05:12.170 --> 05:15.050]  I mean, you say it like it is, so I'm fond of the old testies.
[05:15.470 --> 05:16.650]  No, I know you are. That's right.
[05:16.650 --> 05:23.390]  Look, you've had testicle tragedy in your life, so you're gonna appreciate a testicle in a way that the rest of us probably don't.
[05:23.470 --> 05:25.550]  I respect and admire that in some ways.
[05:25.970 --> 05:28.270]  One of my bollocks, he jumped one day.
[05:30.990 --> 05:32.510]  I've watched testicle tragedy.
[05:32.870 --> 05:35.010]  He zigged when the rest of you zagged.
[05:35.190 --> 05:35.450]  Yeah.
[05:36.970 --> 05:38.670]  And then I zigged to the hospital.
[05:45.590 --> 05:46.830]  Where'd you guys go?
[05:47.030 --> 05:48.590]  This is going great.
[05:48.770 --> 05:49.670]  Are you behind me, Geoff?
[05:50.270 --> 05:53.070]  No, I'm behind Nick, so I don't know where the fuck you guys are.
[05:53.470 --> 05:54.250]  Did we go the wrong way?
[05:54.610 --> 05:55.790]  No, we went the right way.
[05:55.950 --> 05:58.170]  I don't know if Nick went the wrong way.
[05:58.390 --> 05:59.830]  No, no, no. We just got held up for a second.
[06:00.430 --> 06:01.310]  I'm following Andrew.
[06:01.910 --> 06:04.230]  Andrew and Gavin are together.
[06:04.990 --> 06:08.110]  Okay, I can see Andrew's guy honking the horn big style.
[06:08.530 --> 06:08.650]  Yeah, I can see Andrew's guy honking the horn big style.
[06:08.650 --> 06:11.110]  He winds up when he does that.
[06:13.270 --> 06:15.290]  It's like Geoff throwing a baseball.
[06:17.750 --> 06:19.210]  Accurate and with speed.
[06:19.590 --> 06:24.810]  Looks like Nick is right there with Gavin now.
[06:25.270 --> 06:26.390]  Oh, it's a beautiful time of year.
[06:26.890 --> 06:28.110]  Fall in Michigan, huh?
[06:28.870 --> 06:29.710]  What are these, sycamores?
[06:30.450 --> 06:31.730]  Oh, you know they are.
[06:35.690 --> 06:39.190]  I bet I could identify maybe two trees and that's it.
[06:39.650 --> 06:41.230]  Yeah, and one of them is Christmas.
[06:42.710 --> 06:45.730]  Can we all go to Detroit sometime this summer together?
[06:45.910 --> 06:46.470]  Wouldn't that be fun?
[06:46.750 --> 06:49.230]  I don't think I've been outside the airport.
[06:50.590 --> 06:52.130]  There's all kinds of stuff out there.
[06:52.550 --> 06:54.230]  Not that you mentioned it, I probably have flown through there.
[06:54.530 --> 06:58.390]  There's so much more outside the airport than in the airport, you're going to be blown away.
[06:58.630 --> 06:59.370]  That's crazy.
[07:00.550 --> 07:00.990]  Oh!
[07:01.970 --> 07:02.870]  Oh, Andrew.
[07:04.010 --> 07:04.770]  When does this come out?
[07:05.210 --> 07:08.930]  I don't know, we just started recording it.
[07:09.230 --> 07:10.170]  After the 11th, right?
[07:10.790 --> 07:11.110]  Yep.
[07:12.150 --> 07:15.510]  Went by the office this morning, dropped that gimbal off for you, Nick.
[07:15.690 --> 07:16.270]  Oh, thank you.
[07:17.030 --> 07:17.470]  No worries.
[07:18.990 --> 07:19.650]  Looking good.
[07:20.650 --> 07:22.590]  Backroom didn't smell like cat piss this morning.
[07:23.070 --> 07:24.690]  Excellent. Way to go.
[07:24.870 --> 07:27.230]  Did Gavin bring a cat piss smell with him to the office?
[07:27.230 --> 07:28.870]  Yeah, he is.
[07:29.450 --> 07:30.870]  Sometimes you just get hit with it in there.
[07:31.110 --> 07:34.370]  You ever see that movie, that horror movie, It Follows?
[07:34.570 --> 07:38.330]  Gavin is looking to relaunch it with one called Piss Follows.
[07:41.150 --> 07:42.310]  It's a similar idea.
[07:42.470 --> 07:43.990]  There's just always a puddle of piss.
[07:44.730 --> 07:49.890]  There's less murder, but there's way more sticky, stinky, hot piss.
[07:50.270 --> 07:50.670]  Excellent.
[07:50.790 --> 07:56.430]  Now, is it the piss follows him, or is there always a cat ready to piss constantly following him?
[07:56.430 --> 07:59.410]  You think I'm going to give you all the secrets of the film away right now?
[07:59.610 --> 08:00.290]  No way, dude.
[08:01.170 --> 08:04.830]  If you can fill up, you should always fill up.
[08:05.250 --> 08:05.390]  Yep.
[08:05.910 --> 08:07.750]  Yeah, I did.
[08:08.410 --> 08:08.770]  Oh, you did?
[08:09.230 --> 08:10.550]  Swerved in, grabbed it real quick.
[08:11.150 --> 08:12.210]  That was fast.
[08:12.510 --> 08:14.990]  What side is my cap on?
[08:17.330 --> 08:18.330]  It's like the Red Bull team.
[08:18.970 --> 08:19.430]  No cap.
[08:19.710 --> 08:21.250]  Are they still good, the Red Bull team?
[08:22.010 --> 08:25.570]  Uh, I think, uh...
[08:25.570 --> 08:26.490]  Was that Verstappen?
[08:27.370 --> 08:28.910]  Verstappen is on the Red Bull team, yeah.
[08:28.990 --> 08:31.550]  I think he finished fourth in the Miami race.
[08:32.370 --> 08:34.550]  I think McLaren's pretty good.
[08:35.330 --> 08:35.590]  Again.
[08:36.630 --> 08:37.050]  Crazy.
[08:38.950 --> 08:40.090]  Where did all the people go?
[08:41.310 --> 08:42.410]  I'm right behind you.
[08:43.010 --> 08:43.730]  No, not you.
[08:44.210 --> 08:44.870]  In the town.
[08:44.870 --> 08:46.270]  The city, in the town.
[08:46.890 --> 08:48.050]  So there's a lot of...
[08:48.050 --> 08:50.630]  If you read the subreddit, there's a lot of lore
[08:50.630 --> 08:52.530]  about the story behind the story.
[08:52.690 --> 08:55.410]  And a lot of people believe that this is a post-apocalyptic world.
[08:56.550 --> 08:57.790]  Looks pretty nice for that.
[08:58.190 --> 09:00.970]  Everything is so beaten down, and all the roads are in shit.
[09:01.550 --> 09:03.330]  I don't think all the barriers across the roads
[09:03.330 --> 09:03.970]  would still be up.
[09:04.530 --> 09:05.990]  But it could also... Well, who's gonna take them down?
[09:06.330 --> 09:08.490]  It could also just be...
[09:08.490 --> 09:09.150]  Sunday.
[09:10.930 --> 09:12.090]  Could be Sunday.
[09:12.090 --> 09:12.970]  That's true.
[09:13.430 --> 09:15.570]  There's a church somewhere full of 500 people.
[09:15.990 --> 09:17.390]  We definitely have to...
[09:17.950 --> 09:20.890]  There's a flooded church at some point we gotta do stuff with.
[09:21.050 --> 09:21.610]  That's where they are.
[09:21.650 --> 09:24.270]  There's only four people that don't know the apocalypse happened,
[09:24.390 --> 09:25.990]  so we're still just doing our job.
[09:26.190 --> 09:27.510]  We gotta go get the drill, guys.
[09:27.950 --> 09:28.670]  Gotta set it up.
[09:29.410 --> 09:30.590]  Dude, I was reading about some
[09:31.810 --> 09:33.170]  movie on Netflix
[09:33.890 --> 09:35.870]  where, I think it's Argentinian,
[09:36.030 --> 09:37.550]  maybe, where it's a bunch of people
[09:37.550 --> 09:39.250]  who go over to play cards at a house,
[09:39.250 --> 09:40.970]  and then it starts snowing outside,
[09:41.070 --> 09:42.990]  but it's like the middle of the summer, and they look out the window
[09:42.990 --> 09:44.870]  and everybody that touches the snow dies.
[09:45.030 --> 09:46.970]  And so they're trapped in the house, and it's like,
[09:47.390 --> 09:48.830]  they don't know what to do. Have you seen that?
[09:49.330 --> 09:49.690]  No.
[09:50.790 --> 09:52.590]  But I've seen the equivalent of rain,
[09:53.010 --> 09:54.970]  and the idea of somebody watching that going,
[09:55.230 --> 09:57.330]  no, no, no, no, no. We're gonna make it snow.
[09:57.550 --> 09:58.550]  It's gonna be way better.
[09:58.690 --> 10:00.810]  In Argentina. That way,
[10:01.370 --> 10:03.190]  there'll be a double... They'll be playing cards,
[10:03.310 --> 10:04.990]  they were playing chess in the other one.
[10:05.070 --> 10:06.790]  It is such a different film.
[10:07.290 --> 10:08.750]  There's also another film
[10:08.750 --> 10:10.510]  I read about recently, starring
[10:10.510 --> 10:11.190]  Jean Reno.
[10:12.570 --> 10:14.150]  I think it's a French film,
[10:14.710 --> 10:16.650]  called Family Pack,
[10:16.810 --> 10:18.730]  maybe? And it's about a group
[10:18.730 --> 10:20.630]  of villagers who go to bed at night,
[10:20.750 --> 10:22.690]  and then one of them is killed by a werewolf,
[10:22.730 --> 10:24.070]  and they have to figure out who did it.
[10:24.250 --> 10:26.410]  So it seems like One Night Werewolf, the movie?
[10:26.750 --> 10:28.850]  It is. That's exactly what this looks like.
[10:29.510 --> 10:30.930]  And I kinda wanna watch that now.
[10:31.450 --> 10:32.730]  It looks very French, too.
[10:33.110 --> 10:35.010]  It looks like it has
[10:35.010 --> 10:36.470]  European whimsy.
[10:37.690 --> 10:38.570]  Like, yuck.
[10:40.330 --> 10:41.070]  I feel like you're
[10:41.070 --> 10:41.870]  pretty anti-Europe.
[10:43.090 --> 10:45.050]  I'm not anti-Europe, I just think their
[10:45.050 --> 10:46.910]  media is so their media.
[10:48.270 --> 10:48.950]  Like, when you
[10:48.950 --> 10:50.850]  watch, like, an
[10:51.530 --> 10:53.030]  action movie, and you can tell
[10:53.030 --> 10:55.030]  when a French director directed it,
[10:55.070 --> 10:56.290]  and you just go, this is different.
[10:56.670 --> 10:58.190]  This is different in a way that I don't wanna watch.
[11:00.170 --> 11:00.930]  We watched that
[11:00.930 --> 11:02.210]  French free-running movie.
[11:02.210 --> 11:03.350]  We didn't watch that.
[11:04.290 --> 11:05.530]  French free-running.
[11:05.890 --> 11:06.110]  What?
[11:07.330 --> 11:09.330]  That was Hardcore Henry.
[11:10.350 --> 11:12.190]  Oh no, why are you sideways?
[11:12.490 --> 11:12.610]  Andrew?
[11:13.590 --> 11:16.310]  That was Russian. I know what you're talking about.
[11:17.230 --> 11:17.670]  Uh...
[11:17.670 --> 11:19.950]  That was a good-ass movie, dude. I don't know what
[11:19.950 --> 11:21.570]  I was talking about. I love French cinema, personally.
[11:21.950 --> 11:22.550]  That's great.
[11:24.250 --> 11:25.490]  Don't leave me!
[11:26.190 --> 11:28.190]  Nick has a crane. He can flip you over easy.
[11:28.250 --> 11:29.130]  Yeah, I'm almost there.
[11:30.870 --> 11:32.410]  Where are you going?
[11:32.830 --> 11:34.090]  I'm reversing, son.
[11:34.510 --> 11:34.910]  Okay.
[11:36.510 --> 11:38.090]  Skip the scene, damn you. Oh!
[11:38.290 --> 11:39.610]  What? Ah! Ah, Jack!
[11:41.070 --> 11:42.450]  You're a little bit ghosted.
[11:42.570 --> 11:44.450]  What are you doing, Nick? This is not good.
[11:44.770 --> 11:46.090]  Oh, boys, this is bad.
[11:46.350 --> 11:47.750]  I need you guys to get away from me.
[11:48.390 --> 11:50.470]  There we go. Why is Andrew
[11:50.470 --> 11:51.870]  on his side? What happened?
[11:52.290 --> 11:54.510]  I think we both spawned in at the same time
[11:54.510 --> 11:56.030]  and it fucked my vehicle up.
[11:56.550 --> 11:57.550]  But you look like ghosts.
[11:57.550 --> 11:58.750]  Sorry, cool. Good job, Gavin.
[11:59.690 --> 12:00.990]  You don't have a winch?
[12:01.830 --> 12:03.030]  He's winching to a tree.
[12:03.150 --> 12:04.590]  Everybody has a winch.
[12:04.930 --> 12:05.310]  Anchor?
[12:07.110 --> 12:09.550]  It's the handbrake. How do you control where the winch
[12:09.550 --> 12:11.110]  points? Up on the D-pad.
[12:11.990 --> 12:13.550]  Oh, yeah. And then...
[12:15.010 --> 12:15.870]  Umch up the boogie.
[12:20.590 --> 12:21.330]  Attach winch.
[12:21.430 --> 12:22.730]  Oh, you're putting your legs down. Nice.
[12:23.130 --> 12:25.510]  You guys have never been to this map before, right?
[12:26.150 --> 12:26.610]  I have.
[12:27.070 --> 12:28.450]  Oh, you have. Okay, I was going to say
[12:28.450 --> 12:30.430]  you should unlock the garage
[12:30.430 --> 12:30.950]  if you haven't.
[12:33.990 --> 12:34.670]  Hey, Geoff.
[12:34.670 --> 12:36.730]  If I winch to your tire there...
[12:36.730 --> 12:38.550]  Geoff, how do I use
[12:38.550 --> 12:39.070]  the crane?
[12:40.610 --> 12:42.490]  It's hard. I've activated the
[12:42.490 --> 12:44.770]  anchor. Yeah, you go to
[12:44.770 --> 12:46.490]  uh, hold on. So you go up
[12:46.490 --> 12:48.530]  on the D-pad and there's a
[12:48.530 --> 12:50.470]  at the bottom maybe, like
[12:50.470 --> 12:52.550]  activate crane near the bottom.
[12:52.790 --> 12:53.590]  Oh, shit.
[12:53.590 --> 12:55.810]  Uh, I have store
[12:55.810 --> 12:57.370]  crane. Okay, so it's
[12:57.370 --> 13:00.010]  out then. Then you uh...
[13:00.010 --> 13:02.290]  Is there an option to turn on crane controls?
[13:02.430 --> 13:03.150]  Here we go.
[13:03.830 --> 13:05.150]  And then you just, it's just
[13:05.150 --> 13:07.370]  bumpers and triggers and
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.750]  B, E, X.
[13:09.090 --> 13:10.250]  Oh, no.
[13:10.750 --> 13:11.630]  Uh-oh.
[13:12.970 --> 13:14.810]  Oh, I'm even more stuck.
[13:15.270 --> 13:17.630]  I'm caught on the tree. Hold on, let me try one more
[13:17.630 --> 13:19.090]  winch. You got it, Gavin.
[13:19.490 --> 13:21.990]  What the fuck do you...
[13:21.990 --> 13:24.030]  Oh. Okay, and then I'm gonna
[13:24.030 --> 13:25.950]  winch to this point.
[13:27.590 --> 13:28.370]  And then...
[13:28.370 --> 13:29.010]  Winch me!
[13:29.750 --> 13:31.810]  Hold on. Winch!
[13:31.950 --> 13:34.010]  No! I hit travel the black river! Fuck!
[13:34.390 --> 13:35.310]  Oh my god!
[13:36.690 --> 13:38.030]  Now is the time to get
[13:38.030 --> 13:40.150]  Andrew out of here. You're not winching me at all
[13:40.150 --> 13:42.230]  Gavin, you're the tree, you got the tree behind
[13:42.230 --> 13:43.890]  me. Oh, that's my bad.
[13:45.290 --> 13:45.770]  Uh...
[13:45.770 --> 13:47.910]  That will happen. It will happen.
[13:48.350 --> 13:50.090]  I've seen it. I'm coming
[13:50.090 --> 13:52.170]  back! Alright, is this
[13:52.170 --> 13:54.250]  on you, Andrew? When he comes back, it's gonna make things
[13:54.250 --> 13:56.030]  easier. You should not have
[13:56.030 --> 13:58.070]  come back. Why don't you winch to the
[13:58.070 --> 13:59.950]  tree, goddammit? I don't know.
[13:59.990 --> 14:02.370]  I don't know. You might not be very good at this.
[14:03.070 --> 14:03.770]  Oh, Nick!
[14:03.970 --> 14:06.150]  There you go. Pick a part of
[14:06.150 --> 14:07.410]  his vehicle.
[14:08.070 --> 14:09.610]  Like the top and then... Oh, Nick.
[14:09.930 --> 14:11.650]  I'm moving! Oh, oh, oh!
[14:11.730 --> 14:13.250]  He got him! He got him!
[14:13.250 --> 14:14.650]  He did it!
[14:16.470 --> 14:17.110]  What a champion.
[14:17.110 --> 14:19.230]  Woo! That tree got a
[14:19.230 --> 14:20.930]  real good winching, though. Yeah, definitely.
[14:21.610 --> 14:23.210]  Alright, which way, Andrew? Oh, Geoff's already at the
[14:23.210 --> 14:25.050]  service hub. We gotta go to the right.
[14:25.450 --> 14:27.290]  Oh, thank you. Go right.
[14:28.130 --> 14:28.910]  Uh, oil
[14:28.910 --> 14:30.390]  big drill, okay.
[14:32.450 --> 14:33.310]  Must be over here
[14:33.310 --> 14:35.190]  to the right. Look at us trucking
[14:35.190 --> 14:37.330]  like truck boys. Oil rig
[14:37.330 --> 14:39.150]  drill. You're saving
[14:39.150 --> 14:41.170]  me, and it's great. Good teamwork.
[14:41.350 --> 14:42.410]  Yeah, you guys are doing fantastic.
[14:43.170 --> 14:44.530]  It's fun when we all stick together.
[14:44.530 --> 14:46.450]  Well, apart from Geoff doing
[14:46.450 --> 14:48.610]  the mission, but... What are we catching
[14:48.610 --> 14:50.670]  up to? Oh, we gotta make a little bit of progress.
[14:50.770 --> 14:51.690]  Uh, I, uh, uh-oh.
[14:52.470 --> 14:54.530]  Uh-oh. Uh-huh.
[14:55.810 --> 14:56.370]  What's up, buddy?
[14:56.570 --> 14:58.450]  My truck's not big enough.
[14:58.570 --> 15:00.190]  Does anybody have a five slot?
[15:01.250 --> 15:02.870]  I don't think so.
[15:02.970 --> 15:04.390]  I think I've got an even smaller one than you.
[15:04.730 --> 15:06.570]  A five slot? Uh, let me find
[15:06.570 --> 15:08.190]  the garage real fast.
[15:08.670 --> 15:09.810]  And I will
[15:10.590 --> 15:11.610]  go get one.
[15:13.170 --> 15:13.690]  Oh, you
[15:13.690 --> 15:15.410]  know what? Andrew, take a left.
[15:15.550 --> 15:17.670]  Or any of you guys. Gavin, take a left instead of
[15:17.670 --> 15:19.570]  the right. Go over to the trailer store
[15:19.570 --> 15:21.210]  and just buy a five slot trailer.
[15:21.610 --> 15:23.670]  That's what you're gonna do. That's what you wanna
[15:23.670 --> 15:25.550]  do. Trailer store.
[15:26.210 --> 15:27.590]  You just wanna make sure that one that has
[15:28.990 --> 15:29.990]  five... five slots.
[15:30.570 --> 15:31.710]  Yeah. And that you can connect to.
[15:32.470 --> 15:33.550]  I mean, I'm broke. This will
[15:33.550 --> 15:34.050]  definitely work.
[15:36.270 --> 15:37.130]  I'm gonna head...
[15:37.130 --> 15:39.570]  I'm gonna head that way just to be safe.
[15:40.170 --> 15:41.110]  Trailer store.
[15:42.290 --> 15:42.770]  Five.
[15:45.170 --> 15:47.110]  Oh, there's no option for a five.
[15:48.090 --> 15:49.690]  Okay, let me come look at it.
[15:49.890 --> 15:51.610]  Might need to get a
[15:51.610 --> 15:52.310]  trailer that
[15:53.530 --> 15:55.470]  won't connect to your truck anyway. So
[15:55.470 --> 15:56.490]  let me see.
[15:57.210 --> 15:59.010]  I definitely don't have the room for this. Let's see.
[15:59.990 --> 16:01.250]  That's a time challenge.
[16:02.450 --> 16:03.550]  Fuck the time challenges.
[16:03.670 --> 16:05.230]  We don't do those. Yeah.
[16:06.170 --> 16:07.830]  Truck boys have fucking banned
[16:07.830 --> 16:08.610]  time challenges.
[16:10.270 --> 16:11.490]  They feel like
[16:11.490 --> 16:13.490]  anti-trucks. The game.
[16:14.250 --> 16:14.650]  I agree.
[16:15.510 --> 16:16.990]  I feel like you'd need a different playlist
[16:16.990 --> 16:19.710]  to listen to if you were doing time. Saddle high
[16:19.710 --> 16:21.590]  is what we need. Okay.
[16:22.470 --> 16:23.150]  So I'm gonna
[16:24.970 --> 16:25.990]  go to the garage
[16:25.990 --> 16:27.810]  real fast. Get a saddle
[16:27.810 --> 16:28.490]  high.
[16:31.770 --> 16:32.730]  Good honks.
[16:33.430 --> 16:34.190]  Pretty good honks.
[16:35.810 --> 16:36.410]  I'm
[16:36.410 --> 16:37.070]  gonna getcha.
[16:40.430 --> 16:41.190]  Oh shit.
[16:41.410 --> 16:43.010]  I got my crane stuck on me.
[16:46.890 --> 16:48.890]  You trying to lift yourself up?
[16:49.450 --> 16:51.430]  No. I'm trying to get Nick but
[16:51.430 --> 16:53.570]  I got myself all tangled.
[16:55.070 --> 16:55.670]  God
[16:55.670 --> 16:56.790]  damn it.
[16:56.970 --> 16:59.010]  Get up. Adjust.
[16:59.630 --> 17:01.510]  Adjust. He's almost got it.
[17:01.530 --> 17:01.990]  I can tell.
[17:01.990 --> 17:02.610]  How do I?
[17:04.210 --> 17:05.890]  Yeah, you got it.
[17:05.950 --> 17:08.110]  Yeah, there you go.
[17:08.290 --> 17:09.310]  Yeah, good work.
[17:09.670 --> 17:11.870]  Now you're in trouble, Nick.
[17:11.890 --> 17:13.050]  Don't touch me with that.
[17:14.330 --> 17:14.890]  Gotcha!
[17:16.050 --> 17:17.830]  Gotcha! Gavin,
[17:17.890 --> 17:19.010]  save me. Hit him.
[17:19.170 --> 17:21.230]  Frame him, Gavin.
[17:21.430 --> 17:23.110]  You're not near him on my screen.
[17:23.750 --> 17:25.410]  Oh, he's winched. I'm winched.
[17:26.390 --> 17:27.250]  I'm pulling him.
[17:27.710 --> 17:30.130]  I'm getting him real good. I'm fishing him in.
[17:30.130 --> 17:31.770]  I got a big one!
[17:32.310 --> 17:33.850]  I got a big one!
[17:34.290 --> 17:35.310]  He's reeling himself in.
[17:36.590 --> 17:38.330]  I'm pulling myself to the fish.
[17:38.470 --> 17:39.690]  This is the new way to fish.
[17:40.530 --> 17:42.170]  Crane mode, engage.
[17:43.550 --> 17:44.390]  If the fish
[17:44.390 --> 17:46.190]  stayed still and the fishermen had to reel
[17:46.190 --> 17:47.770]  themselves to the fish, I would watch fishing.
[17:47.930 --> 17:48.490]  Oh, you've winched me.
[17:49.310 --> 17:51.110]  I've winched you? Me.
[17:51.950 --> 17:54.130]  Okay, boys, I'm coming back to get
[17:54.130 --> 17:55.830]  the big oil rig
[17:55.830 --> 17:58.270]  drill thing. That's good because we're not
[17:58.270 --> 18:00.250]  gonna... we're not getting out of our
[18:00.250 --> 18:02.230]  own way here. Oh, he winched
[18:02.230 --> 18:02.510]  Nick.
[18:05.710 --> 18:06.150]  Nick
[18:06.150 --> 18:06.930]  winched me.
[18:08.190 --> 18:09.450]  Oh, let's get Gavin together.
[18:10.430 --> 18:12.290]  Oh, we can't do it at the same time.
[18:12.830 --> 18:14.290]  Well, wait, maybe I can
[18:14.290 --> 18:16.210]  winch you. No, it'll undo
[18:16.210 --> 18:16.750]  my winch.
[18:18.770 --> 18:20.090]  If there was like a
[18:20.090 --> 18:22.110]  dual winching DLC, I would be
[18:22.110 --> 18:23.130]  interested. Hell yeah.
[18:23.950 --> 18:26.190]  It'd be cool. There's like 15 DLCs in
[18:26.190 --> 18:27.270]  there. No, I don't think it's gonna happen.
[18:29.110 --> 18:30.310]  Damn it. It just breaks
[18:30.310 --> 18:32.310]  immediately. But I'm right there with you, dude.
[18:32.350 --> 18:33.490]  I think that'd be awesome. Okay.
[18:34.950 --> 18:36.410]  Halo just added a new gun.
[18:37.190 --> 18:38.650]  I saw that. People love it too.
[18:38.830 --> 18:40.010]  Which Halo? Infinite.
[18:40.770 --> 18:42.070]  Two. We should play a Halo.
[18:43.470 --> 18:44.210]  Yeah, it's weird. They added
[18:44.210 --> 18:45.890]  it to ODST. I don't know why, but yeah.
[18:48.690 --> 18:49.710]  That doesn't sound right.
[18:50.650 --> 18:52.190]  Oh, look at that. That's a massive
[18:52.190 --> 18:54.150]  old drill. Yeah, it's a big
[18:54.150 --> 18:55.330]  drill. No wonder you needed that trailer.
[18:55.890 --> 18:57.990]  Okay, let's go
[18:58.590 --> 18:59.650]  back? Yeah.
[19:00.650 --> 19:02.170]  We need to take it to the drill site.
[19:02.630 --> 19:03.270]  Let's do it.
[19:03.950 --> 19:05.890]  You have to. We gotta.
[19:06.770 --> 19:07.530]  Let's go.
[19:08.050 --> 19:09.470]  I wanna see how this pans out.
[19:10.050 --> 19:11.630]  Back to the start.
[19:13.390 --> 19:14.050]  Hey, your
[19:14.050 --> 19:15.030]  anchor is out.
[19:16.570 --> 19:18.070]  Yeah, it's extra balance. I'm
[19:18.070 --> 19:20.150]  wider. It's a wider stance. Andrew, I don't think that's what
[19:20.150 --> 19:22.110]  it is. No, it's a wider stance. I won't tip
[19:22.110 --> 19:23.470]  over. Yeah, I agree.
[19:23.810 --> 19:24.210]  Okay.
[19:26.830 --> 19:28.250]  You see the massive
[19:28.250 --> 19:30.310]  boom up still driving down the
[19:30.310 --> 19:32.050]  street. Just so you guys don't
[19:32.050 --> 19:34.090]  lose me. It's like a field
[19:34.090 --> 19:35.090]  trip. Recover your
[19:36.070 --> 19:38.150]  fucking crane before you end up
[19:38.150 --> 19:39.790]  flipped across the map.
[19:39.970 --> 19:41.850]  Andrew, the wires.
[19:42.170 --> 19:44.050]  I'm not gonna flip. I got an extra wide stance, Geoff.
[19:44.430 --> 19:45.790]  Andrew, the power wires.
[19:46.230 --> 19:48.010]  No, when that thing grabs
[19:48.010 --> 19:49.950]  something it's not supposed to grab, you're gonna go
[19:49.950 --> 19:50.230]  pew!
[19:51.510 --> 19:53.490]  I'm gonna cam that. That sounds awesome.
[19:54.350 --> 19:55.930]  I'm a guy like me not worried
[19:55.930 --> 19:57.590]  about that, you know. Slowing down, Nick.
[19:57.730 --> 19:59.490]  I gotta be in the front. I'm the fastest.
[20:00.310 --> 20:01.850]  With my wide stance, look
[20:01.850 --> 20:03.510]  at my wingspan.
[20:03.990 --> 20:05.750]  Or whatever. What's the
[20:05.750 --> 20:07.930]  opposite of wingspan? What's the legspan?
[20:08.230 --> 20:08.650]  Legspan?
[20:10.110 --> 20:11.530]  Oh, I'm going too fast.
[20:11.670 --> 20:12.230]  I'm going to...
[20:14.090 --> 20:14.510]  Splitspan.
[20:15.690 --> 20:17.630]  You guys are doing great. You're such
[20:17.630 --> 20:19.630]  big helps right now. You're doing a lot
[20:19.630 --> 20:20.670]  to accomplish the mission.
[20:21.490 --> 20:22.490]  Keep going.
[20:24.230 --> 20:24.970]  Sorry, Nick.
[20:27.250 --> 20:29.610]  Oh, I'm gonna look so cool going through this puddle.
[20:30.630 --> 20:31.050]  Yeah!
[20:31.970 --> 20:32.790]  How's it look, Gav?
[20:33.010 --> 20:35.750]  It looks great. I don't know how
[20:35.750 --> 20:37.710]  he's not hitting these power lines, but it's
[20:37.710 --> 20:39.610]  very impressive. Luckily, they don't seem
[20:39.610 --> 20:40.090]  to exist.
[20:41.390 --> 20:42.950]  This is gonna exist, though.
[20:43.490 --> 20:45.190]  Oh, he left.
[20:45.190 --> 20:47.030]  Do you think it'll still be up?
[20:49.510 --> 20:50.730]  That's a great question.
[20:50.790 --> 20:52.870]  I doubt it. Let's see.
[20:54.110 --> 20:55.090]  Is this the furthest
[20:55.090 --> 20:57.390]  all of us have ever traveled? Yeah, definitely.
[20:57.830 --> 20:59.330]  Oh, sure. You mean together?
[20:59.530 --> 21:00.570]  All of us together? Yeah.
[21:00.990 --> 21:02.230]  Oh, no!
[21:02.230 --> 21:03.270]  No, no, no, no!
[21:04.390 --> 21:06.650]  Not that it was a high bar to me.
[21:07.090 --> 21:08.390]  Oh, no!
[21:09.050 --> 21:11.030]  It happened again! You flipped?
[21:11.130 --> 21:12.870]  Oh, shit! You guys
[21:12.870 --> 21:14.870]  responded to me to fuck me up
[21:14.870 --> 21:16.130]  real bad. Why did that happen?
[21:16.430 --> 21:19.010]  I'm gonna need you guys to clear the fuck out
[21:19.010 --> 21:20.370]  up there before I can come through.
[21:20.690 --> 21:21.270]  Uh, give us a minute.
[21:22.730 --> 21:24.050]  Andrew's sideways, dude.
[21:24.590 --> 21:26.850]  When Andrew's a ghost, he's like only half
[21:26.850 --> 21:28.830]  a ghost. Yes, absolutely. I'm not a real ghost.
[21:28.970 --> 21:30.210]  It becomes a real problem.
[21:31.770 --> 21:32.690]  Oh, thanks.
[21:34.510 --> 21:36.650]  You guys are getting pretty good at this part of it, I think.
[21:36.870 --> 21:39.130]  I don't think that's a...
[21:39.130 --> 21:40.510]  I don't think that's gonna work.
[21:40.510 --> 21:42.450]  Yeah, but I feel like you're not steering
[21:42.450 --> 21:43.650]  in the right direction either.
[21:44.390 --> 21:45.630]  Hold on! Hold on!
[21:47.030 --> 21:47.430]  Okay.
[21:48.330 --> 21:48.690]  Okay!
[21:50.330 --> 21:51.210]  Now how do I do?
[21:54.210 --> 21:56.450]  Shall I just get behind and drag you back down?
[21:56.890 --> 21:57.430]  Oh, that didn't work.
[21:57.930 --> 21:59.630]  I'll save gas.
[22:00.490 --> 22:01.990]  Alright, I'm gonna work my way around.
[22:02.670 --> 22:03.010]  Okay.
[22:05.170 --> 22:06.930]  Oh! Oh, I'm pulling from the wrong end.
[22:06.990 --> 22:07.350]  Hold on.
[22:12.700 --> 22:13.560]  God damn it, Nick.
[22:13.660 --> 22:14.400]  You fucking idiot.
[22:15.040 --> 22:15.940]  The fact that you have your little
[22:17.180 --> 22:18.720]  stands out is probably...
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.840]  Oh, you know what? Yeah, let me pull those
[22:20.840 --> 22:22.760]  back, because it was helping me not tip over.
[22:22.800 --> 22:24.140]  Could you pull them back while you're upside down?
[22:26.260 --> 22:26.980]  Oh, wow!
[22:27.320 --> 22:28.720]  You almost righted yourself.
[22:31.180 --> 22:31.900]  Attach winch.
[22:32.220 --> 22:32.960]  Pull that back out.
[22:34.160 --> 22:36.080]  He has his test.
[22:36.180 --> 22:36.960]  Winch point.
[22:36.960 --> 22:37.100]  Winch point.
[22:40.740 --> 22:41.660]  Okay, well...
[22:41.660 --> 22:42.200]  Thank you!
[22:43.360 --> 22:44.980]  Oh, I hit the fucking
[22:44.980 --> 22:46.980]  wrong button! Oh no, Geoff, I'm
[22:46.980 --> 22:49.040]  coming back! Please don't.
[22:49.120 --> 22:49.960]  Please don't. Please don't.
[22:50.040 --> 22:51.760]  Go, Geoff, go!
[22:52.380 --> 22:54.440]  Just go through it, Geoff. You're clear.
[22:58.740 --> 23:00.640]  I'm back in the Smithville dam.
[23:00.940 --> 23:01.920]  We're playing with time zones.
[23:02.020 --> 23:04.980]  Alright, you stay here. I don't know if you left again.
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.060]  I'm going back to Black River.
[23:09.240 --> 23:09.960]  Jesus Christ.
[23:10.700 --> 23:11.960]  How's trucks going so far, Geoff?
[23:12.480 --> 23:13.880]  I mean, I'm doing great.
[23:14.300 --> 23:15.340]  We're all doing really good.
[23:16.820 --> 23:17.560]  Staying as a group.
[23:18.980 --> 23:20.740]  Is it safe for me to come through the other end?
[23:20.940 --> 23:22.240]  No, he's still in the zone.
[23:22.840 --> 23:24.860]  And Gavin's backing up into the zone.
[23:25.380 --> 23:25.560]  Yeah.
[23:26.340 --> 23:28.220]  Alright, it's free, Geoff.
[23:28.680 --> 23:29.240]  Yeah, go for it.
[23:29.520 --> 23:32.880]  Should we get gas? Or should we just go straight to the site?
[23:33.520 --> 23:34.340]  Yeah, we should get gas.
[23:34.540 --> 23:36.400]  Gas stop. Is there a gas on the way?
[23:36.920 --> 23:37.740]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[23:38.300 --> 23:38.340]  Where?
[23:40.020 --> 23:41.360]  It's probably the same gas we took.
[23:42.720 --> 23:44.960]  Flying J? I mean, like, really, wherever you need to go.
[23:45.400 --> 23:45.740]  Pilot?
[23:46.280 --> 23:47.140]  Holy shit, Geoff.
[23:49.100 --> 23:51.000]  You spawned, like, a meter out of the zone
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.080]  either side. It's so big.
[23:53.360 --> 23:53.700]  Cool.
[23:54.880 --> 23:56.840]  Alright, I'm gonna take a second
[23:56.840 --> 23:58.440]  to look at where I'm going.
[23:59.620 --> 24:00.400]  You wanna get fuel
[24:00.400 --> 24:02.480]  where we got fuel earlier, or you wanna get to go to the drill site
[24:02.480 --> 24:02.920]  straight away?
[24:02.920 --> 24:04.320]  Excuse me.
[24:05.500 --> 24:06.720]  I'd be up for a fuel.
[24:07.040 --> 24:07.320]  Alright.
[24:08.580 --> 24:09.660]  Excuse me.
[24:10.080 --> 24:11.100]  Pardon me.
[24:12.670 --> 24:13.280]  Excuse me.
[24:14.780 --> 24:15.360]  Uh.
[24:16.580 --> 24:17.360]  Excuse me.
[24:18.040 --> 24:20.620]  What? Oh, sorry, I was looking at my map.
[24:21.900 --> 24:22.340]  Pardon me.
[24:24.420 --> 24:25.920]  I'm just trying to get by bush.
[24:26.580 --> 24:27.120]  Excuse me.
[24:30.060 --> 24:30.640]  Don't.
[24:30.640 --> 24:31.240]  Do not.
[24:32.320 --> 24:34.040]  Do not attach to me.
[24:39.060 --> 24:40.600]  This thing flips
[24:40.600 --> 24:41.100]  over.
[24:41.620 --> 24:44.560]  We gotta start from scratch.
[24:44.660 --> 24:46.700]  There's no way, with the help of you guys, I'm gonna be
[24:46.700 --> 24:47.960]  able to get this thing right.
[24:49.220 --> 24:50.500]  You know exactly what I mean.
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.820]  Come on.
[24:53.820 --> 24:54.660]  This is so much
[24:54.660 --> 24:55.400]  more complicated.
[24:57.860 --> 24:58.120]  Come on.
[24:59.860 --> 25:00.480]  Pull me.
[25:01.020 --> 25:02.120]  Are you sucking on me?
[25:02.240 --> 25:02.720]  Okay, you're not.
[25:06.220 --> 25:08.040]  What a problem in everyday life.
[25:08.140 --> 25:08.680]  You sucking on me?
[25:09.200 --> 25:10.960]  Retract your stands, maybe.
[25:13.220 --> 25:13.540]  I know
[25:13.540 --> 25:17.040]  that idea is anathema to you, but...
[25:17.040 --> 25:17.300]  Fuck.
[25:21.200 --> 25:22.080]  Andrew, would you say
[25:22.080 --> 25:23.620]  that you're in rabbit mode in this truck's video?
[25:24.000 --> 25:24.900]  Oh my god.
[25:24.900 --> 25:26.980]  Okay, I gotta...
[25:26.980 --> 25:28.760]  I gotta get rid of my
[25:28.760 --> 25:30.900]  wide stands. Holy shit.
[25:31.400 --> 25:31.460]  Ah!
[25:33.140 --> 25:34.340]  Slow down for the mud, Gavin.
[25:36.240 --> 25:36.960]  I feel like
[25:36.960 --> 25:38.940]  if I get enough speed in this truck, it starts
[25:38.940 --> 25:39.800]  to feel like I'm on ice.
[25:40.700 --> 25:42.880]  Oh, you skate. Just start sliding
[25:42.880 --> 25:44.540]  around. Dude, we can
[25:44.540 --> 25:46.900]  go to some ice planets, don't you
[25:46.900 --> 25:49.400]  worry. Ice planets?
[25:49.400 --> 25:50.820]  When you're in fucking
[25:50.820 --> 25:52.800]  Alaska, it's gonna feel like a whole other
[25:52.800 --> 25:54.860]  planet, dude. Yeah. Gavin has experienced
[25:54.860 --> 25:56.420]  the bad ice. Yeah.
[25:56.620 --> 25:58.800]  Oh no. I played this once in front of my wife
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.520]  on that level. Oh my god.
[26:00.820 --> 26:02.140]  Like, she hated it.
[26:04.300 --> 26:04.800]  Falling through
[26:04.800 --> 26:06.620]  the fucking ice is the worst.
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.860]  You can fall through the ice? A whole big time.
[26:09.060 --> 26:09.900]  Oh man.
[26:11.260 --> 26:12.800]  A lot. You will do
[26:12.800 --> 26:14.840]  it a lot if we ever progress past Michigan.
[26:15.840 --> 26:16.100]  Yeah.
[26:16.960 --> 26:17.700]  We'll get there.
[26:18.620 --> 26:20.260]  Oh yeah? How many videos do you think that'll be?
[26:21.140 --> 26:22.460]  We'll get there.
[26:22.960 --> 26:23.980]  I'm gonna guess
[26:24.840 --> 26:25.320]  conservatively
[26:26.280 --> 26:27.520]  35. Okay.
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.480]  Almost there.
[26:30.340 --> 26:31.360]  What are we on, three?
[26:31.960 --> 26:34.460]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. As regulation.
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.500]  The fuckface videos
[26:36.500 --> 26:36.920]  won't count.
[26:38.560 --> 26:39.180]  Nick, where are you?
[26:39.540 --> 26:41.660]  You guys are flying, dude.
[26:42.620 --> 26:43.040]  Where are you?
[26:44.740 --> 26:46.280]  Oh, I'm just further back down the street.
[26:46.560 --> 26:48.440]  Oh. I've only got 27 gases there.
[26:48.900 --> 26:50.200]  Out of how many gases?
[26:50.440 --> 26:51.580]  You've got 27 gases?
[26:52.060 --> 26:52.900]  It's not enough, dude.
[26:53.380 --> 26:55.360]  What do you think the route to go here is, Gavin?
[26:56.160 --> 26:57.940]  Go back the exact way we came.
[26:57.940 --> 26:59.680]  Can we ford this non-existent river?
[27:00.680 --> 27:01.580]  Yeah. Why not?
[27:02.400 --> 27:02.820]  Okay.
[27:03.840 --> 27:05.020]  We are gonna drown.
[27:05.620 --> 27:06.840]  Make my way back to you guys.
[27:07.200 --> 27:10.200]  Check a map here in a second. Did you guys get to the city already?
[27:10.580 --> 27:10.740]  Yeah.
[27:12.420 --> 27:14.020]  How the hell do we get over there?
[27:15.320 --> 27:16.000]  Oh, okay.
[27:16.000 --> 27:16.880]  I see.
[27:17.140 --> 27:18.740]  We'll go to the lumber mill, Gavin.
[27:19.100 --> 27:20.840]  There's a little back road.
[27:21.740 --> 27:23.580]  And there's a bridge that's out. But we can ford the river.
[27:24.160 --> 27:24.660]  Yeah, let's do it.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.220]  I feel pretty confident in this truck.
[27:27.420 --> 27:29.220]  These trucks are huge! Geoff, why are you laughing?
[27:32.460 --> 27:33.840]  I was thinking of something else.
[27:34.080 --> 27:34.320]  Okay.
[27:36.860 --> 27:38.440]  I would like to drive a real truck.
[27:39.840 --> 27:40.860]  I'd like to see you drive anything.
[27:41.200 --> 27:42.620]  Yeah, I'd like to see you drive a real car.
[27:43.360 --> 27:44.440]  I'll drive my car.
[27:44.440 --> 27:45.680]  Geoff, can I drive it?
[27:46.340 --> 27:46.780]  Nevermind.
[27:47.120 --> 27:47.300]  Sorry.
[27:49.560 --> 27:50.260]  That was quick.
[27:52.460 --> 27:53.780]  You can see me drive that.
[27:54.340 --> 27:54.760]  Cool.
[27:54.840 --> 27:56.220]  What are you two doing?
[27:57.440 --> 27:59.020]  We're going to the lumber mill.
[27:59.700 --> 28:00.140]  No.
[28:01.000 --> 28:01.440]  Yeah.
[28:02.560 --> 28:03.000]  No.
[28:05.440 --> 28:06.720]  Gavin, we're going to the lumber mill, right?
[28:07.880 --> 28:08.160]  Yeah.
[28:09.920 --> 28:10.360]  Why?
[28:11.120 --> 28:12.340]  To ford the river.
[28:13.200 --> 28:13.720]  Why?
[28:14.580 --> 28:16.060]  It's the fastest route there.
[28:16.700 --> 28:17.200]  Okay.
[28:17.440 --> 28:18.780]  It's the fastest route.
[28:18.980 --> 28:22.400]  I don't think the fastest route
[28:22.400 --> 28:24.700]  is going to be the best route for you.
[28:24.900 --> 28:25.460]  But, okay.
[28:26.280 --> 28:29.440]  I'm not going to join y'all in that.
[28:29.660 --> 28:29.860]  Why?
[28:30.220 --> 28:32.100]  I'm going to go a different way.
[28:32.160 --> 28:32.560]  You getting fuel?
[28:34.020 --> 28:36.440]  It's not my limitations as a driver.
[28:36.700 --> 28:37.640]  I just didn't know.
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.960]  There's something funny happening somewhere else?
[28:40.080 --> 28:40.600]  I don't know.
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.480]  How big is this river?
[28:44.240 --> 28:45.920]  You guys will be able to ford it, probably.
[28:46.140 --> 28:47.900]  But I don't know that this truck is set up for it.
[28:47.980 --> 28:50.380]  I don't know that I want to take a five-slot trailer.
[28:50.540 --> 28:51.280]  You also have a trailer.
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.300]  That's difficult.
[28:52.460 --> 28:53.740]  Why don't we see if we can ford it?
[28:54.140 --> 28:56.380]  You guys should definitely ford it.
[28:56.800 --> 28:58.200]  I think that's a great idea.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.620]  It looked all right on the map.
[29:01.160 --> 29:02.440]  Yeah, it probably is.
[29:03.380 --> 29:05.200]  I'll be honest. I haven't done it in a long, long time.
[29:05.200 --> 29:06.100]  So I don't really remember.
[29:07.140 --> 29:09.960]  I know that there's real marshy in that area around the farm.
[29:10.200 --> 29:11.380]  And I've been stuck there a lot.
[29:11.440 --> 29:12.540]  And I just don't want to do it with this trailer.
[29:13.160 --> 29:13.680]  That's fair.
[29:14.100 --> 29:16.760]  I'm using a new truck. I don't know how powerful it is.
[29:17.880 --> 29:19.000]  But you guys will be fine.
[29:20.720 --> 29:20.980]  Easy.
[29:21.320 --> 29:23.300]  So easy.
[29:23.520 --> 29:24.560]  He don't know shit.
[29:24.900 --> 29:25.540]  Yeah, that's right.
[29:27.220 --> 29:28.540]  Look, Gavin. There it is.
[29:29.980 --> 29:30.620]  I'll speed up.
[29:31.180 --> 29:31.540]  Oh, yeah.
[29:33.700 --> 29:34.500]  Oh, that's...
[29:34.500 --> 29:35.420]  Look, Gavin. We just stick...
[29:35.420 --> 29:36.200]  Look at that.
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.540]  Oh, fuck, Geoff.
[29:41.200 --> 29:43.300]  Goddamn, we're fucking skating in this thing.
[29:43.400 --> 29:44.120]  All right, back up.
[29:45.760 --> 29:47.080]  Oh, just this bit here?
[29:47.260 --> 29:47.620]  Yeah.
[29:48.040 --> 29:50.720]  Oh, that's easy. I thought you meant the bit over there.
[29:51.280 --> 29:52.580]  Oh, wait. No.
[29:54.400 --> 29:55.140]  We're doing bits?
[29:55.640 --> 29:57.860]  Not sure if Nick knows what he means.
[29:58.000 --> 29:58.600]  This is exciting.
[29:58.600 --> 29:59.920]  Where are you going?
[30:00.360 --> 30:01.080]  That's not what I meant.
[30:01.760 --> 30:02.240]  No.
[30:04.600 --> 30:05.500]  Okay, I'll watch.
[30:07.200 --> 30:08.120]  I got a crane.
[30:09.420 --> 30:10.420]  I'm just gonna follow you.
[30:11.660 --> 30:12.200]  Truck down.
[30:12.920 --> 30:13.780]  How deep does this get?
[30:14.680 --> 30:15.160]  Andrew.
[30:16.700 --> 30:18.880]  I'm right by you guys.
[30:19.500 --> 30:19.760]  Where?
[30:21.060 --> 30:22.320]  Yeah, you know what? I don't have the confidence.
[30:22.580 --> 30:23.900]  Oh, he's back behind us.
[30:24.940 --> 30:26.420]  He's testing the river.
[30:26.420 --> 30:28.840]  Yeah, I just thought maybe I could make it.
[30:30.980 --> 30:32.080]  I think Andrew flipped.
[30:33.060 --> 30:34.780]  I sure did. I was going too fast.
[30:35.300 --> 30:36.620]  Let's go help Andrew, I guess.
[30:38.200 --> 30:39.260]  Are you back there?
[30:39.780 --> 30:42.600]  There is a way to get across there.
[30:42.680 --> 30:44.420]  There's that sunken road right there.
[30:44.500 --> 30:45.120]  It is possible.
[30:45.360 --> 30:46.460]  We got it. We crossed.
[30:46.920 --> 30:49.380]  Yeah, but we're going back to get Andrew.
[30:51.300 --> 30:51.720]  All right, let's go.
[30:51.880 --> 30:52.800]  Andrew didn't make it.
[30:52.800 --> 30:54.480]  It really wasn't that bad of a river.
[30:56.420 --> 30:57.440]  Andrew, you tip a lot.
[30:58.880 --> 31:00.760]  I should have had my wide stance out.
[31:03.740 --> 31:07.140]  I just really wanted to see this river you two were crossing, so I got excited.
[31:07.300 --> 31:08.060]  I was driving fast.
[31:08.560 --> 31:09.340]  You got jealous of it.
[31:09.740 --> 31:11.540]  Not jealous, I was excited.
[31:12.660 --> 31:14.640]  I wanted to be part of the river crew.
[31:15.820 --> 31:16.620]  River boys.
[31:17.420 --> 31:19.020]  Yeah, I wanted to be a river boy.
[31:19.240 --> 31:21.240]  Huck Finn and uh...
[31:21.240 --> 31:23.560]  Oh no.
[31:23.900 --> 31:24.340]  Gavin.
[31:25.840 --> 31:27.060]  Let me tell you,
[31:27.140 --> 31:27.840]  you tip over a lot.
[31:27.960 --> 31:29.480]  River boy down.
[31:30.940 --> 31:32.020]  This turnaround phase.
[31:32.440 --> 31:33.900]  That truck was right up.
[31:34.520 --> 31:36.400]  When I looked again, it was down.
[31:38.580 --> 31:40.620]  All right, well...
[31:40.620 --> 31:43.080]  I feel like my engine should stay on when I'm on my side.
[31:45.580 --> 31:47.340]  Which one are you going to pull over first?
[31:47.960 --> 31:48.420]  Wait a minute.
[31:48.420 --> 31:49.600]  Where am I doing this?
[31:49.720 --> 31:51.620]  This is good.
[31:52.420 --> 31:53.340]  I'll start with Andrew.
[31:53.540 --> 31:54.800]  Then I take that motherfucker.
[31:56.640 --> 31:58.440]  You don't have to worry about old Geoff, he's doing fine.
[31:58.820 --> 31:59.040]  I know.
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.280]  You guys just keep making all the progress
[32:02.280 --> 32:04.080]  toward the mission that you're doing over there.
[32:04.140 --> 32:05.500]  You guys are killing it.
[32:06.220 --> 32:07.400]  Turning in all the important stuff.
[32:07.680 --> 32:08.720]  Yeah, we got it.
[32:10.940 --> 32:11.640]  Thank you.
[32:13.040 --> 32:15.080]  Nick is very good at flipping people over.
[32:15.560 --> 32:16.100]  Nick's a pro.
[32:17.020 --> 32:18.520]  I got it.
[32:18.600 --> 32:19.980]  It's an important skill to learn.
[32:20.080 --> 32:21.460]  Yeah, he's really good at it.
[32:22.060 --> 32:22.860]  You got Gavin?
[32:23.120 --> 32:26.260]  I think Andrew wants to do it too, but he's not lined up in a way
[32:26.260 --> 32:28.560]  that I would think would be beneficial to either one of them.
[32:28.640 --> 32:30.120]  He's trying to pull him sideways style.
[32:31.020 --> 32:31.720]  Hit Y, Gavin.
[32:32.040 --> 32:32.840]  Gavin, hit Y.
[32:33.100 --> 32:35.920]  Gavin, hit Y.
[32:36.400 --> 32:37.220]  Okay, all right.
[32:38.140 --> 32:38.940]  All right.
[32:39.840 --> 32:42.080]  I don't know how...
[32:42.080 --> 32:44.340]  Just physics wise, I don't know how that works.
[32:44.340 --> 32:45.620]  Geoff, where the hell are you?
[32:46.200 --> 32:47.180]  Oh, he's going around.
[32:47.440 --> 32:49.160]  He's going up and around to go through the road.
[32:49.840 --> 32:51.140]  I'm not going to make that turn.
[32:51.400 --> 32:52.740]  I'll have to go around.
[32:53.840 --> 32:55.580]  Shoot, I don't know why you would go around.
[32:55.660 --> 32:57.060]  You can just go through river style.
[32:57.600 --> 32:59.000]  River boy style, baby.
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.420]  River boy style.
[33:04.580 --> 33:06.200]  I don't want to make that turn.
[33:06.960 --> 33:07.940]  Get in the river, boys.
[33:09.040 --> 33:09.860]  Splash around.
[33:10.000 --> 33:10.760]  Baptism time.
[33:10.760 --> 33:11.980]  Oh, here we go.
[33:12.100 --> 33:13.240]  Should have followed you guys.
[33:14.220 --> 33:16.600]  Oh, listen to that. River boys win again.
[33:16.780 --> 33:18.620]  River boys won. Geoff, zero.
[33:19.300 --> 33:20.360]  I just don't want to make a turn.
[33:20.820 --> 33:21.680]  Andrew, damn.
[33:22.220 --> 33:24.800]  Just going for it. Just going for the river.
[33:25.300 --> 33:25.540]  Riven.
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.440]  You like turn away from the road. It's nuts.
[33:32.220 --> 33:34.960]  That way, if you flip, you flip harder and get more momentum.
[33:35.200 --> 33:37.220]  You can carry it around and land back on your feet.
[33:37.500 --> 33:38.950]  He's always on two wheels.
[33:38.950 --> 33:40.510]  Two wheels, but steering...
[33:41.150 --> 33:42.930]  Andrew doesn't turn into the skid yet.
[33:43.150 --> 33:43.830]  Nothing can tip me.
[33:45.910 --> 33:46.550]  He's on ice.
[33:47.030 --> 33:48.230]  He's going the opposite way.
[33:50.750 --> 33:52.370]  Why are you wide again?
[33:52.850 --> 33:54.230]  So I don't get tipped over.
[33:54.870 --> 33:55.890]  Yeah, that worked last time.
[33:56.970 --> 33:58.110]  I didn't have it out last time.
[33:58.270 --> 33:59.050]  Wide shoes, baby.
[34:00.510 --> 34:01.290]  Wide shoes.
[34:02.750 --> 34:03.670]  That's for me and you.
[34:04.170 --> 34:05.330]  Yeah, that's for Eric and Geoff.
[34:08.950 --> 34:10.890]  Our wives are never going to watch this, so it's just for us.
[34:17.310 --> 34:17.710]  Dickhead.
[34:19.310 --> 34:19.710]  Okay.
[34:27.070 --> 34:29.230]  I'm glad there's no face cam for that.
[34:29.590 --> 34:31.710]  I want to go have a look-see at Geoff.
[34:31.770 --> 34:35.110]  I bet I did not look like a macho, confident dude in that second.
[34:36.710 --> 34:38.770]  We're going to go slim again.
[34:40.670 --> 34:41.890]  Are you slimming up?
[34:42.490 --> 34:42.970]  Slimming up.
[34:42.970 --> 34:44.330]  Fucking slim mode.
[34:45.250 --> 34:46.070]  God, this Michigan.
[34:46.230 --> 34:47.310]  I shouldn't say anything out loud.
[34:48.310 --> 34:49.150]  Carmel, fuck me.
[34:50.910 --> 34:52.150]  You're going to say it's easy as shit?
[34:52.550 --> 34:54.710]  Yeah, I remember Michigan being a lot tougher
[34:54.710 --> 34:56.170]  when I was learning how to play the game, man.
[34:56.270 --> 34:57.870]  It's fucking...
[34:57.870 --> 34:59.950]  You survive the Yukon and suddenly
[34:59.950 --> 35:01.230]  Michigan doesn't look so scary.
[35:03.410 --> 35:05.690]  I'd see why you'd want to live here, Hannah.
[35:06.510 --> 35:07.250]  Yeah, it's beautiful.
[35:07.790 --> 35:10.330]  I mean, the part of Michigan I'm going to move to
[35:10.330 --> 35:12.750]  has better roads, but yeah.
[35:18.470 --> 35:20.450]  Did you just flip a random truck?
[35:20.890 --> 35:21.810]  Yeah, I did.
[35:23.970 --> 35:24.850]  There he is.
[35:28.490 --> 35:28.990]  Hello.
[35:29.370 --> 35:29.790]  Hello.
[35:31.630 --> 35:33.310]  Just wanted to get the around the bend action.
[35:33.730 --> 35:34.310]  Oil rig drop.
[35:35.370 --> 35:36.270]  Nick, are you coming in backwards?
[35:37.090 --> 35:38.890]  Just backing up so I can watch Geoff.
[35:38.890 --> 35:39.650]  Nice.
[35:40.030 --> 35:42.430]  Oh, I see the objective coming this way. That's great.
[35:42.850 --> 35:44.150]  Geoff is the objective now.
[35:44.450 --> 35:47.330]  Thanks for prepping the site for me, guys.
[35:47.870 --> 35:49.610]  Oh, it's all clear for you.
[35:49.670 --> 35:50.470]  It looks great.
[35:53.210 --> 35:54.910]  A little dicey right there.
[35:58.390 --> 35:59.430]  Hold on.
[35:59.810 --> 36:00.330]  I'm good.
[36:01.350 --> 36:02.790]  I don't need to go low.
[36:04.010 --> 36:05.270]  You don't need low.
[36:05.270 --> 36:05.370]  There we go.
[36:18.300 --> 36:20.080]  Look at that. Coming across the river.
[36:20.740 --> 36:21.100]  Beautiful.
[36:21.580 --> 36:22.600]  This is river boy style.
[36:22.940 --> 36:23.960]  Let's stop here and take a portrait.
[36:24.760 --> 36:26.800]  Oh, no. Stop. Stop moving.
[36:28.160 --> 36:29.740]  Gotta hit the handbrake first.
[36:30.120 --> 36:32.000]  Never mind. I'm just going to keep going.
[36:32.540 --> 36:33.160]  I'm just going to keep going.
[36:33.440 --> 36:34.020]  We'll get a photo later.
[36:38.460 --> 36:39.440]  Need a hit?
[36:39.820 --> 36:41.320]  Nope. Nope. I'm good.
[36:41.480 --> 36:42.860]  Nobody touch me. I'm fine. It's cool.
[36:42.860 --> 36:44.340]  I got it.
[36:44.720 --> 36:47.100]  I'm going to tag you.
[36:48.520 --> 36:49.260]  Please don't.
[36:49.580 --> 36:50.200]  I'm going to tag you.
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.620]  There's no need to do that.
[36:52.520 --> 36:54.500]  You're going to make a victory bridge.
[36:55.680 --> 36:56.840]  If you touch my truck,
[36:56.920 --> 36:58.160]  Geoff will go under like a limbo.
[36:58.400 --> 36:58.820]  Wow.
[37:04.910 --> 37:05.890]  Victory horns.
[37:06.670 --> 37:07.710]  Victory horns.
[37:08.210 --> 37:08.950]  Not victory yet.
[37:09.550 --> 37:10.890]  You want me to pull you out?
[37:11.250 --> 37:12.890]  Nope. No need to touch me.
[37:12.890 --> 37:13.930]  Not touching you?
[37:14.090 --> 37:16.990]  I'll unstick myself.
[37:17.230 --> 37:17.950]  Not touching you?
[37:18.390 --> 37:19.510]  No need to touch me.
[37:20.390 --> 37:20.790]  You sure?
[37:22.390 --> 37:23.870]  I'll ram the fuck out of you.
[37:24.130 --> 37:25.530]  I know you will.
[37:25.610 --> 37:26.750]  I appreciate that.
[37:27.510 --> 37:28.190]  I love that.
[37:28.970 --> 37:31.470]  I have that in my arsenal of options.
[37:31.790 --> 37:33.870]  You want to fall back on it?
[37:36.290 --> 37:37.710]  I'm one of those guys
[37:37.710 --> 37:38.850]  who just wants to do everything.
[37:39.050 --> 37:40.170]  I'm difficult that way.
[37:40.170 --> 37:41.150]  I want to do it myself.
[37:41.970 --> 37:42.590]  You've done it.
[37:43.610 --> 37:46.510]  No need to attach to me.
[37:47.390 --> 37:48.270]  Pulling in with you.
[37:50.830 --> 37:51.630]  I can't.
[37:51.630 --> 37:54.410]  I can't fucking unload it until you let go of me.
[37:54.690 --> 37:55.350]  I'm bowing.
[37:56.230 --> 37:57.150]  You did a good job.
[37:57.290 --> 37:58.530]  A little bow by me.
[38:01.670 --> 38:03.070]  That actually got me stuck.
[38:04.610 --> 38:05.830]  Took away all his momentum.
[38:06.390 --> 38:07.250]  I was just doing a little bow.
[38:08.050 --> 38:09.850]  What Fast and Furious movie was he in?
[38:11.590 --> 38:13.570]  I think he died in the third,
[38:13.670 --> 38:14.870]  but then came back in the sixth.
[38:16.730 --> 38:17.630]  I think that was someone else.
[38:18.150 --> 38:19.030]  I'm one stuck, Geoff.
[38:19.490 --> 38:20.870]  It's definitely someone else.
[38:23.590 --> 38:24.070]  Oh!
[38:26.770 --> 38:28.410]  Oh my god.
[38:29.330 --> 38:31.250]  Gavin, pull ahead of me
[38:31.870 --> 38:32.750]  so I can attach to you.
[38:32.970 --> 38:33.590]  There you go.
[38:33.590 --> 38:36.070]  Somehow I lost
[38:36.070 --> 38:37.430]  my momentum in the mud.
[38:37.510 --> 38:38.930]  I don't know what it could have been.
[38:40.370 --> 38:41.970]  Andrew wants to get his wheels
[38:41.970 --> 38:43.610]  tilted away from the tip.
[38:50.550 --> 38:51.150]  Pulling.
[38:51.990 --> 38:52.890]  Off we go.
[38:57.270 --> 39:03.090]  A little bit further.
[39:03.410 --> 39:05.370]  Let me switch to
[39:06.450 --> 39:06.930]  low.
[39:07.410 --> 39:09.370]  There you go. I got you from the back.
[39:11.070 --> 39:13.450]  It wasn't intentional, but I was helping.
[39:16.290 --> 39:17.450]  What's so close?
[39:18.910 --> 39:19.690]  That's got to be
[39:19.690 --> 39:20.170]  unloadable.
[39:20.410 --> 39:22.410]  You guys are so close.
[39:23.090 --> 39:25.270]  There you go.
[39:26.450 --> 39:27.170]  Stage complete.
[39:28.730 --> 39:30.570]  No one can stop you guys.
[39:31.710 --> 39:33.330]  Another chapter for the
[39:33.330 --> 39:34.570]  truck boys.
[39:35.950 --> 39:36.490]  Congratulations, everybody.
[39:36.730 --> 39:38.570]  That was pure
[39:40.610 --> 39:41.130]  teamwork,
[39:41.430 --> 39:42.050]  you could say.
[39:42.350 --> 39:44.170]  Great teamwork all the way around.
[39:44.450 --> 39:47.330]  We learned a lot. Everybody had nice trucks.
[39:48.570 --> 39:48.990]  What a time.
[39:49.410 --> 39:50.350]  Everybody did have nice trucks.
[39:50.470 --> 39:53.050]  The important thing is we built
[39:53.050 --> 39:54.210]  the drilling site.
[39:54.930 --> 39:55.930]  Andrew's back up.
[39:56.570 --> 39:58.690]  Does it get us some ore or some oil?
[39:59.990 --> 40:01.050]  I think it got us
[40:01.050 --> 40:02.150]  paid a couple bucks.
[40:02.490 --> 40:04.930]  We can forward the next tank
[40:04.930 --> 40:07.050]  of gas now. I just feel like I want a cut
[40:07.050 --> 40:07.890]  of the oil, you know?
[40:08.250 --> 40:09.930]  The river calls to me.
[40:10.390 --> 40:12.970]  I understand. I'm right there with you.
[40:13.030 --> 40:14.910]  Oh god, Andrew. The river
[40:14.910 --> 40:16.770]  calls. Andrew's going to the
[40:16.770 --> 40:18.930]  river boy time. Alright, should we get
[40:18.930 --> 40:19.970]  over the river and then cool it?
[40:21.570 --> 40:22.950]  Are we going to ford
[40:22.950 --> 40:23.690]  it there, Andrew?
[40:24.430 --> 40:26.730]  That's what I'm doing. Don't do that.
[40:26.950 --> 40:27.950]  Don't do what I'm doing.
[40:27.950 --> 40:29.930]  Don't do what I'm doing.
[40:30.690 --> 40:31.850]  I'm a stealth
[40:31.850 --> 40:32.310]  truck.
[40:33.450 --> 40:35.150]  Did he go completely under?
[40:35.530 --> 40:36.930]  Did he drown in this game, Geoff?
[40:38.850 --> 40:39.590]  Sort of.
[40:39.690 --> 40:40.610]  Your truck can die.
[40:42.190 --> 40:43.370]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:43.910 --> 40:44.910]  You won't see him anymore.
[40:45.310 --> 40:46.530]  He's downstream floating.
[40:48.370 --> 40:49.450]  River boy down.
[40:49.790 --> 40:50.770]  River boy down.
[40:51.810 --> 40:52.990]  Can the crane reach him, Geoff?
[40:53.490 --> 40:56.150]  No, he's gone.
[40:56.150 --> 40:57.690]  What if we get right before
[40:57.690 --> 41:00.170]  that depth and try and crane him back?
[41:00.830 --> 41:02.130]  Is that him that I'm
[41:02.130 --> 41:04.230]  looking at right there? Yeah, you're right.
[41:04.630 --> 41:04.810]  Yeah.
[41:05.830 --> 41:06.910]  Yeah, that's me.
[41:09.110 --> 41:10.030]  I don't...
[41:10.030 --> 41:11.550]  Yeah, I know it's a dangerous water level.
[41:12.230 --> 41:12.870]  Oh, handbrake.
[41:14.650 --> 41:16.330]  Let's see. Activate
[41:16.330 --> 41:18.090]  anchor. Nope, it's going to flip me.
[41:18.710 --> 41:19.370]  Yeah, don't do that.
[41:22.810 --> 41:23.510]  Oh wow.
[41:24.510 --> 41:25.250]  He's moving.
[41:25.790 --> 41:26.950]  Are you pulling him, Geoff?
[41:27.010 --> 41:28.450]  I'm becoming one with the river.
[41:29.370 --> 41:30.050]  Yeah, I'm pulling him.
[41:30.890 --> 41:33.090]  Are you pulling him to further danger?
[41:33.550 --> 41:34.590]  No, I'm going to pull him across the water.
[41:34.850 --> 41:35.050]  Okay.
[41:37.230 --> 41:39.530]  I'm going to let you go for a second, okay?
[41:39.610 --> 41:41.590]  But I'm going to go back.
[41:41.970 --> 41:43.610]  I just need to change my winch position.
[41:44.670 --> 41:44.910]  For you.
[41:45.450 --> 41:46.850]  My guy's been through a lot.
[41:48.230 --> 41:48.990]  Stop. You mean
[41:48.990 --> 41:50.670]  your guy put himself through a lot?
[41:50.670 --> 41:51.610]  Yeah.
[41:51.870 --> 41:53.790]  That's a way to put it.
[41:54.210 --> 41:55.870]  Cockpit camera not available underwater.
[42:02.070 --> 42:03.110]  I can't see Gavin's driver.
[42:03.630 --> 42:05.850]  When you're underwater, the cockpit camera should just switch to that
[42:05.850 --> 42:07.950]  Windows 98 fish screensaver.
[42:11.850 --> 42:12.810]  Eric, look!
[42:13.550 --> 42:14.930]  A weredog!
[42:15.490 --> 42:15.910]  Awesome.
[42:17.410 --> 42:18.990]  It's a statue.
[42:18.990 --> 42:20.810]  It's all a statue in the car.
[42:21.570 --> 42:22.350]  Alright, Andrew.
[42:23.050 --> 42:24.330]  We're going to do this.
[42:32.290 --> 42:32.790]  Wow.
[42:34.070 --> 42:35.330]  What a save.
[42:36.410 --> 42:37.470]  Oh, I'm on fire!
[42:38.210 --> 42:38.570]  What?
[42:40.870 --> 42:42.290]  You're on fire in the water?
[42:42.730 --> 42:44.050]  Oh, wow. That's not good.
[42:46.030 --> 42:47.450]  Is your engine getting damaged?
[42:47.830 --> 42:50.630]  His engine is stalling and it's shooting fire out.
[42:51.230 --> 42:52.090]  The fire's great.
[42:52.090 --> 42:53.890]  Did you have a snorkel on that thing?
[42:54.490 --> 42:55.850]  The river has turned me into
[42:55.850 --> 42:57.230]  a twisted metal boy.
[42:58.490 --> 42:59.370]  Sweet tooth.
[43:03.170 --> 43:05.370]  Get the hot dogs out, guys. I got them.
[43:05.390 --> 43:06.150]  Let's help him.
[43:07.470 --> 43:07.910]  Wow.
[43:10.450 --> 43:11.670]  Alright, Geoff. Keep going
[43:11.670 --> 43:12.630]  and I'm going to ram him.
[43:15.230 --> 43:15.930]  Alright, you ram.
[43:16.730 --> 43:18.070]  I'm digging myself into this
[43:18.070 --> 43:19.530]  mud here. I'm going to have to
[43:19.530 --> 43:21.250]  dig myself out first.
[43:21.250 --> 43:22.250]  Here we go.
[43:29.770 --> 43:31.130]  I've installed my engine.
[43:32.830 --> 43:34.290]  You're just spitting flames.
[43:35.590 --> 43:36.270]  I'm almost there.
[43:36.910 --> 43:37.390]  Oh, man.
[43:37.410 --> 43:39.310]  If you could just push him a little bit further, I can...
[43:39.310 --> 43:39.850]  Oh, you got it.
[43:40.230 --> 43:45.330]  Oh, man. I cannot
[43:45.330 --> 43:46.490]  pull you
[43:48.270 --> 43:48.970]  that way.
[43:49.850 --> 43:51.070]  Does this look stupid, Gavin?
[43:52.350 --> 43:53.070]  This way.
[43:54.110 --> 43:55.590]  Andrew's just floating away. That looks pretty
[43:55.590 --> 43:56.550]  stupid. Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[43:57.450 --> 43:59.390]  I got him. I got him. The current's
[43:59.390 --> 44:00.110]  pulling him, Geoff.
[44:02.110 --> 44:03.370]  Geoff, do you need me to get ahead of you
[44:03.370 --> 44:04.650]  so you can winch to me at some point?
[44:05.250 --> 44:07.430]  I got trees to winch to. I just can't get up
[44:07.430 --> 44:07.790]  this hill.
[44:09.610 --> 44:11.490]  I just need to get him to...
[44:13.570 --> 44:15.270]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[44:16.170 --> 44:17.490]  It's okay. It's alright. It's okay.
[44:17.730 --> 44:23.310]  Why are you winching to me?
[44:23.790 --> 44:24.830]  I'm not trying to.
[44:25.650 --> 44:27.790]  But you did. I know I did.
[44:28.310 --> 44:29.030]  It wasn't my intent.
[44:33.850 --> 44:35.110]  I'm trying to winch to Geoff.
[44:36.450 --> 44:37.570]  There you go. Winch to me here.
[44:38.850 --> 44:39.690]  You got it?
[44:41.010 --> 44:41.730]  Thank you.
[44:41.890 --> 44:42.950]  I'll give you another anchor point.
[44:42.950 --> 44:44.470]  There we go.
[44:45.750 --> 44:46.830]  Look at my engine.
[44:47.170 --> 44:47.950]  Gavin, it's just you.
[44:49.930 --> 44:50.710]  We made it.
[44:50.950 --> 44:52.310]  I'll take a running start here.
[44:52.950 --> 44:53.750]  You got it. You got it.
[44:54.830 --> 44:56.370]  Andrew is still shooting fire.
[44:57.490 --> 44:58.950]  It's like firecrackers.
[45:00.190 --> 45:00.950]  River boys.
[45:01.090 --> 45:02.870]  Andrew got the match upgrade.
[45:05.150 --> 45:06.170]  Oh, Gavin went the wrong way.
[45:06.870 --> 45:08.070]  Oh, Gavin, no.
[45:10.210 --> 45:10.990]  Is this the wrong way?
[45:10.990 --> 45:13.170]  You got it.
[45:13.270 --> 45:13.770]  You're alright.
[45:15.030 --> 45:16.030]  Oh, God.
[45:17.030 --> 45:17.590]  How?
[45:20.110 --> 45:21.290]  He's got a snorkel.
[45:21.730 --> 45:22.390]  Yeah, he's snorkeling.
[45:23.510 --> 45:25.010]  Dude, you made that look
[45:25.010 --> 45:26.450]  like a fucking joke, Gavin.
[45:27.290 --> 45:28.030]  That was awesome.
[45:28.330 --> 45:29.350]  I feel good about that one.
[45:30.250 --> 45:30.810]  Congratulations.
[45:32.410 --> 45:33.530]  Hell yeah.
[45:33.830 --> 45:36.170]  Mission accomplished.
[45:37.290 --> 45:38.750]  Good job, everyone.
[45:38.750 --> 45:40.750]  River boys, truck boys.
[45:41.330 --> 45:42.750]  You completed a mission.
[45:48.190 --> 45:50.890]  Geoff, how are you feeling about progress on trucks now?
[45:51.650 --> 45:52.990]  I feel pretty good, man.
[45:53.250 --> 45:54.810]  These guys worked real hard
[45:54.810 --> 45:56.790]  on the mission today. They made a lot of progress.
[45:57.070 --> 45:58.530]  I just kind of was there to
[45:58.530 --> 45:59.810]  dot the i's and cross the t's.
[46:00.670 --> 46:02.410]  But they did most of the yeoman's work,
[46:02.490 --> 46:03.830]  and it's looking real good for us.
[46:03.910 --> 46:07.030]  We can set our sights on the next map,
[46:07.030 --> 46:08.190]  which I believe is Alaska.
[46:08.630 --> 46:08.970]  Wow.
[46:09.650 --> 46:11.410]  What did I say? 35 parts?
[46:12.410 --> 46:14.050]  I'm going to revise it a little bit.
[46:15.410 --> 46:16.610]  Max 48.
[46:16.870 --> 46:17.930]  Max 48 parts.
[46:18.170 --> 46:18.390]  Alaska.
[46:20.950 --> 46:22.850]  It's like a reverse rocket launch.
[46:23.610 --> 46:24.570]  Well, from dispatch,
[46:24.730 --> 46:26.030]  I call this a success.
[46:26.330 --> 46:27.670]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[46:28.050 --> 46:29.190]  This has been truck boys.
[46:30.750 --> 46:32.990]  There's a flying crossbody occurring
[46:32.990 --> 46:34.910]  with some of the trucks
[46:34.910 --> 46:36.410]  in the river. Good stuff.
[46:36.750 --> 46:38.230]  We'll see you guys next time. Bye!
[46:38.890 --> 46:39.350]  Bye!
