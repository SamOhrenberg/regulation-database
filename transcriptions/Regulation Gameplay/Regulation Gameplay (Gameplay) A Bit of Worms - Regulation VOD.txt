[00:00.000 --> 00:01.740]  I have hit the start streaming button.
[00:01.820 --> 00:02.460]  Wow, we're streaming.
[00:02.860 --> 00:07.320]  It's now it's up to God and the Internet.
[00:07.700 --> 00:08.800]  Hello, God. Hello, Internet.
[00:09.940 --> 00:12.600]  I don't even get God when I am hitting start streaming.
[00:12.680 --> 00:13.520]  This is I feel good.
[00:14.400 --> 00:16.460]  Yeah, I'm just what I'm trying, man.
[00:16.580 --> 00:20.980]  If you assume that God is a I mean, I know he's omnipotent and omniscient, right?
[00:21.460 --> 00:24.080]  But if God were to ever to take like a Morgan Freeman
[00:24.080 --> 00:27.660]  esque human form or even the idea of humanity,
[00:27.660 --> 00:30.620]  kind of like in Bruce Almighty. OK.
[00:31.100 --> 00:33.220]  What subreddits do you think he would read and subscribe?
[00:34.880 --> 00:36.800]  What do you think God's a fan of?
[00:37.180 --> 00:39.200]  I think. Am I the asshole?
[00:40.100 --> 00:42.080]  I think he likes that one. Explain to me like I'm five.
[00:42.300 --> 00:44.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44.900 --> 00:46.900]  Accidental renaissance he's been really into.
[00:47.520 --> 00:48.940]  Yeah, dude, that's pretty cool.
[00:49.060 --> 00:54.040]  This is actually a really good like let's let's think what God really likes.
[00:54.140 --> 00:55.060]  Old school. Cool.
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.680]  What's the there's a.
[00:59.340 --> 01:00.640]  There's a man.
[01:01.640 --> 01:02.360]  What's it? Fuck.
[01:02.780 --> 01:04.800]  Somebody said somebody said Argon Wild.
[01:04.960 --> 01:05.940]  I doubt it.
[01:06.060 --> 01:07.960]  No, not not God. He didn't see that.
[01:08.120 --> 01:09.540]  Yeah, he made it all. Yeah.
[01:09.680 --> 01:11.240]  Yeah. Honest. Honestly, he's sick of it.
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.160]  He's so fucking over it. Yeah.
[01:13.460 --> 01:13.700]  Yeah.
[01:14.100 --> 01:15.220]  It's like regularism.
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.600]  Yeah, he's looking at it.
[01:18.620 --> 01:19.440]  He's having a drink.
[01:19.440 --> 01:20.840]  He's laughing his ass off.
[01:21.260 --> 01:23.760]  These dorks. That's what I'm talking about.
[01:23.760 --> 01:27.220]  He reads. He reads our frugal and all those.
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.460]  So you could pick up ideas for ways to fuck with this.
[01:29.840 --> 01:32.220]  It's like these guys are giving me gold today.
[01:32.220 --> 01:34.560]  I'd like to think he's really into Reddit street magic.
[01:35.260 --> 01:37.000]  Just oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.080]  And see what's out there.
[01:38.080 --> 01:39.640]  See what he could do.
[01:39.680 --> 01:45.320]  R slash black magic fuckery where it's just people falling for street magic.
[01:45.500 --> 01:47.760]  But all of the comments are people going, how do you do that?
[01:47.900 --> 01:48.700]  How do you do that?
[01:49.220 --> 01:49.960]  Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
[01:50.240 --> 01:51.560]  So, yeah, that's really funny.
[01:51.680 --> 01:53.060]  That's that's so cool.
[01:53.060 --> 01:54.200]  Oh, it's quite a lot of piss rats.
[01:54.460 --> 01:55.520]  Dude, nature is metal. That's good.
[01:56.040 --> 01:58.200]  Uh, yeah, more corn cats, if I'm really being honest.
[01:58.680 --> 01:58.880]  That's what I'm seeing.
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.880]  All right. Yeah, a lot of corn cats.
[02:01.020 --> 02:01.440]  Thank you.
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.160]  And the stream.
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.880]  Piss rats to stop the stream.
[02:04.380 --> 02:04.960]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:05.260 --> 02:06.500]  Corn cats it is. There they are.
[02:06.940 --> 02:08.660]  There you go. It looks like we should end it.
[02:09.180 --> 02:09.980]  Looks like we should end it.
[02:10.520 --> 02:13.280]  A lot of corn cats made their first comment as corn cat.
[02:13.580 --> 02:16.260]  I love the idea of that being what you lead with,
[02:16.860 --> 02:19.800]  like just showing up here for the first time, being like, ah, you know what?
[02:20.120 --> 02:21.900]  Six corn cats. That's how I'm starting.
[02:22.580 --> 02:25.260]  All right. There's a lot of corn, but there are way more piss.
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.440]  So I think we're starting the stream.
[02:27.600 --> 02:29.120]  Are we? OK, we are.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.020]  Go for piss.
[02:30.180 --> 02:33.460]  Ladies, gentlemen, welcome to Worms.
[02:34.460 --> 02:37.240]  Yeah, baby, we're worming today.
[02:38.500 --> 02:39.860]  It is Eric.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.020]  It is Andrew.
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.000]  It is Geoff. It is Gavin.
[02:43.180 --> 02:45.020]  So therefore, it is Lil Ricky B.
[02:45.180 --> 02:47.740]  It is Gizmo. It is Baby Pepsi.
[02:48.340 --> 02:50.980]  And it is, uh, what's Gavin's?
[02:50.980 --> 02:52.920]  Gassy Goo. Gassy Goo, thank you.
[02:53.340 --> 02:55.640]  We're back and better than ever.
[02:56.820 --> 02:57.700]  Nick is not here.
[02:57.780 --> 03:00.400]  He decided that he doesn't care about you guys on a Friday.
[03:00.880 --> 03:02.460]  He said, I'm better than this.
[03:02.780 --> 03:03.720]  And we said, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:03.740 --> 03:06.140]  You shouldn't like shouldn't say that, man.
[03:06.220 --> 03:08.260]  And he's like, no, I'm not coming to this.
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.300]  He's like, he said, they say silence speaks volumes, but nobody's reading my books.
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.800]  He said, he said, Real G's moving silence like lasagna.
[03:18.140 --> 03:20.520]  And I went, what is that we talking about, man?
[03:22.060 --> 03:25.580]  I think Nick's great as the guy who's going to put this together over the weekend.
[03:25.720 --> 03:27.780]  I'm just going to say, I think Nick's wonderful.
[03:28.420 --> 03:30.400]  I think Nick would love it if Eric readied up.
[03:30.660 --> 03:35.020]  I think my team name is Nick's because clearly I am a big fan of Nick.
[03:35.400 --> 03:38.460]  I'm not quite ready because guys, before we get started,
[03:38.600 --> 03:40.200]  we have a very special announcement.
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.860]  If you're a Falcon, if you're on the Falcon tier of our Patreon,
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.760]  Andrew, tell them what they get today.
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.840]  Tonight, it is Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[03:51.200 --> 03:54.900]  We're going to watch some people be sloppy at a slight angle.
[03:55.420 --> 03:56.420]  We're going to be playing bingo.
[03:56.860 --> 03:57.980]  Someone's going to win a cake.
[03:58.100 --> 04:01.160]  It's probably going to be Eric because he wins every time for some reason.
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.540]  Possibly we'll watch people named Joe, but we doubt
[04:04.540 --> 04:06.280]  we'll be able to find out if that's true or not.
[04:06.600 --> 04:09.260]  Yep. So that is a Falcon exclusive event.
[04:09.340 --> 04:12.760]  Every month we do a Falcon exclusive event.
[04:13.220 --> 04:16.540]  Sometimes it's watching stuff, you know, it's watch alongs, playing games.
[04:17.140 --> 04:20.740]  We are doing Sloppy Joe's bingos for the Falcon.
[04:21.020 --> 04:22.020]  Gavin, are you ready?
[04:22.180 --> 04:24.140]  Were you ready up already? Let's do this.
[04:26.900 --> 04:29.220]  Now, I named my team Fruit Demons.
[04:29.340 --> 04:32.640]  I don't think I ever got around to actually naming the players Fruit Demons.
[04:32.840 --> 04:33.300]  Oh, cool.
[04:33.480 --> 04:35.680]  I think it's just the team name that's named.
[04:36.360 --> 04:36.980]  Oh, that's cool.
[04:37.200 --> 04:38.480]  The part that doesn't really show up at all.
[04:38.840 --> 04:42.660]  Yeah, but we're going to learn some Fruit Demon names is what we're going to do.
[04:44.500 --> 04:45.340]  Well, I'm ready.
[04:45.340 --> 04:48.080]  Oh, look, Harry, the classic Fruit Demon.
[04:48.940 --> 04:50.720]  That's a lot of, that's a lot of Knicks.
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.840]  Well, I figured since we're, since Nick couldn't be here and he was only here in spirit,
[04:55.040 --> 04:59.420]  I would pay an homage to Nick with my four favorite Knicks that are all just named Nick.
[04:59.720 --> 05:00.620]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[05:00.820 --> 05:03.060]  I thought you were going to go for like Stevie and then...
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.260]  Cage and then...
[05:06.260 --> 05:08.140]  Yeah, Sheep on a Rope has to use the rope.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.180]  My favorite, Nick-Nack.
[05:09.620 --> 05:11.220]  No, there's just Nick, Shorts four times.
[05:14.340 --> 05:15.380]  Andrew, no!
[05:15.600 --> 05:16.520]  What the fuck?
[05:16.740 --> 05:17.720]  Are you serious?
[05:19.580 --> 05:19.940]  No!
[05:21.740 --> 05:22.540]  What the hell?
[05:22.540 --> 05:23.740]  Maybe the rope will get it out.
[05:24.500 --> 05:26.600]  How do I rope? How do I rope?
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.220]  How do I rope?
[05:29.240 --> 05:31.180]  Oh, come on!
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.480]  Come on, rope somewhere!
[05:32.800 --> 05:33.380]  Rope somewhere!
[05:34.200 --> 05:35.220]  You're an idiot.
[05:36.740 --> 05:37.740]  That's bullshit!
[05:38.500 --> 05:39.840]  What a start to the game.
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.000]  That was not my fault.
[05:43.080 --> 05:44.740]  There's plenty that will be my fault.
[05:44.820 --> 05:46.220]  That was not my fault.
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.420]  How is that not your fault?
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.860]  It got stuck in the tiniest pixel we've ever seen.
[05:51.160 --> 05:52.260]  Seemed like your fault.
[05:52.720 --> 05:53.900]  Yeah, I don't want to tell you.
[05:54.060 --> 05:55.200]  Alright, Nick's up.
[05:55.220 --> 05:56.540]  Nick, what are we going to do?
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.580]  Let's enter the drill boat.
[05:59.700 --> 06:01.880]  Yeah, honestly, right there.
[06:02.320 --> 06:03.940]  Breezy's right. Such a gizmo move.
[06:05.060 --> 06:06.420]  He's going for it on Patreon.
[06:07.140 --> 06:08.660]  No, not on Patreon.
[06:09.260 --> 06:11.120]  Oh, he's jamming up the car.
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.400]  Oh, Auron261 with a bunch of gifted memberships. Thank you so much.
[06:13.880 --> 06:14.920]  Wow! Awesome.
[06:15.360 --> 06:17.060]  Thanks, Auron261.
[06:17.200 --> 06:17.580]  Boring.
[06:20.140 --> 06:21.320]  Why does he say boring?
[06:23.160 --> 06:24.380]  Did anything happen?
[06:24.420 --> 06:28.120]  Nothing. I completely froze as I was playing the game.
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.360]  I just shut down.
[06:29.760 --> 06:30.400]  Way to go, buddy.
[06:30.740 --> 06:32.800]  Oh, it's BungleFud.
[06:33.700 --> 06:34.580]  Here's BungleFud.
[06:35.560 --> 06:36.680]  Why is it BungleFud?
[06:37.240 --> 06:38.980]  Okay, so A is jump?
[06:39.560 --> 06:39.820]  Shit.
[06:40.180 --> 06:43.260]  First comment I just read.
[06:43.360 --> 06:45.260]  Can't wait for the which one is jump question.
[06:46.200 --> 06:48.000]  Good call, LooneyTunes93.
[06:48.220 --> 06:48.940]  Good call.
[06:49.480 --> 06:50.260]  How do I?
[06:50.840 --> 06:52.640]  How do I?
[06:53.420 --> 06:53.620]  A.
[06:55.720 --> 06:56.760]  Without you.
[06:57.360 --> 06:58.140]  I want to do this.
[06:59.340 --> 07:01.060]  Oh, shit. That's jump.
[07:01.380 --> 07:01.900]  Shit.
[07:02.140 --> 07:04.380]  Okay, cool. So he listened to me when I said it.
[07:04.540 --> 07:05.420]  No, March!
[07:05.940 --> 07:08.040]  Oh, my God.
[07:08.940 --> 07:10.200]  What the fuck, March?
[07:12.660 --> 07:13.180]  Wow.
[07:13.460 --> 07:14.920]  That was a successful first turn for me.
[07:15.200 --> 07:16.320]  That was really good.
[07:16.960 --> 07:17.700]  Yeah, I like it.
[07:18.400 --> 07:21.220]  Gavin, you've been playing this game for years.
[07:21.340 --> 07:24.120]  That's true, but the controls between the games
[07:24.120 --> 07:24.740]  have switched.
[07:25.560 --> 07:28.600]  And we've just been playing so many different worms.
[07:28.960 --> 07:30.160]  And also, I have to now play
[07:30.160 --> 07:32.040]  as Meg's account, DeltaPCrab,
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.980]  and her controls have switched.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.680]  So they switched back.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.100]  So overall, I'm very confused about the buttons.
[07:38.300 --> 07:40.380]  And we've been playing Mario Party all goddamn day,
[07:40.460 --> 07:42.480]  so you've got those buttons in your head.
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.520]  Well, we played for eight minutes this morning.
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.480]  All goddamn day is maybe the largest
[07:46.480 --> 07:48.080]  exaggeration I've ever heard.
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.460]  Oh, you guys didn't keep playing after we stopped?
[07:50.680 --> 07:50.920]  Nope.
[07:51.660 --> 07:53.500]  Who was Knuckle? Who just got murdered?
[07:55.940 --> 07:56.940]  Oh, Andrew got murdered.
[07:56.940 --> 07:57.280]  Oh, me, apparently.
[07:57.820 --> 07:58.780]  What the fuck?
[07:59.040 --> 08:02.320]  I was trying to craft something.
[08:02.320 --> 08:04.020]  I wasn't even paying attention.
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.580]  There you go.
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.820]  Mario Party March on Patreon, guys.
[08:07.920 --> 08:10.220]  That is the name of my team.
[08:10.580 --> 08:12.560]  Mario Party March on Patreon.
[08:13.040 --> 08:13.520]  But...
[08:13.520 --> 08:17.420]  I think March is dead, so Mario Party on Patreon.
[08:17.620 --> 08:19.040]  Check it out, starting tomorrow.
[08:19.400 --> 08:19.720]  Come on.
[08:20.760 --> 08:21.200]  Tomorrow.
[08:23.080 --> 08:25.020]  And then we'll cut it all together at the end
[08:25.020 --> 08:26.700]  for those who don't want to watch it
[08:26.700 --> 08:27.720]  every single day.
[08:27.880 --> 08:30.720]  So what you're saying, Eric, is that we're playing 30 turns every day?
[08:31.430 --> 08:31.680]  Yeah.
[08:32.680 --> 08:34.240]  Man, I don't get it.
[08:34.240 --> 08:36.820]  We're releasing a three and a half hour video every single day.
[08:37.000 --> 08:38.420]  How is there confusion?
[08:38.700 --> 08:40.180]  Oh, I thought they were doing it every day.
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.940]  We are. One turn every day.
[08:42.960 --> 08:43.460]  Crazy.
[08:44.240 --> 08:46.540]  I'm excited. We did turn one.
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.440]  It's kind of wedged in there.
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.100]  Uh-oh.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.020]  Turn it around.
[08:53.460 --> 08:55.200]  Leave on Patreon alone.
[08:55.300 --> 08:55.800]  Turn it around.
[08:56.180 --> 08:57.640]  This was the dilemma I had.
[08:57.640 --> 08:59.660]  This game sucks.
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.140]  Two of the turns so far
[09:02.140 --> 09:03.760]  have been gumming up this car.
[09:03.820 --> 09:05.620]  No! On Patreon!
[09:06.060 --> 09:06.480]  That was cool.
[09:07.240 --> 09:08.120]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[09:09.960 --> 09:11.120]  Not mad at that.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.300]  Okay, it's Nick's turn.
[09:14.800 --> 09:15.980]  What are you going to do, Nick?
[09:16.420 --> 09:17.760]  What are you going to do?
[09:17.880 --> 09:18.820]  How about this?
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.280]  I like this idea.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.280]  I like this idea a lot.
[09:23.280 --> 09:24.060]  Who's that purple one?
[09:25.480 --> 09:25.880]  It's...
[09:27.020 --> 09:27.740]  Who's it?
[09:28.760 --> 09:29.400]  It's me.
[09:31.660 --> 09:32.120]  Classic fruit demon.
[09:33.580 --> 09:34.140]  Uh-oh.
[09:35.860 --> 09:36.400]  Oh no!
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.280]  We don't know where it's going to go.
[09:39.120 --> 09:41.020]  He's going at me. He's mad about Knuckle.
[09:41.660 --> 09:43.100]  Andrew, did you by any chance...
[09:43.100 --> 09:44.480]  Knuckle's not my guy. I don't give a fuck about Knuckle.
[09:45.140 --> 09:46.700]  Oh, I thought this was Andrew's turn. Sorry.
[09:46.740 --> 09:47.640]  Nah, I'm Nick.
[09:51.060 --> 09:52.540]  Why is everyone so confused?
[09:53.560 --> 09:54.840]  It's been a long week, man.
[09:55.000 --> 09:56.120]  We also had...
[09:56.120 --> 09:59.080]  We did only play eight minutes of Mario Party,
[09:59.240 --> 10:00.740]  but we also did other stuff today.
[10:01.060 --> 10:02.920]  There was other stuff today, yeah.
[10:03.120 --> 10:04.920]  Ooh, condo snacks.
[10:05.740 --> 10:07.240]  I don't think you can say that.
[10:07.520 --> 10:07.820]  No?
[10:08.780 --> 10:11.140]  It doesn't sound like a word you can say on Twitch.
[10:12.020 --> 10:12.900]  Let's see what happens.
[10:13.860 --> 10:14.000]  Okay.
[10:15.120 --> 10:16.300]  Let's get back on air.
[10:17.160 --> 10:17.760]  Not really.
[10:19.100 --> 10:21.180]  I might try and slow...
[10:21.180 --> 10:23.940]  Do a back jump.
[10:24.020 --> 10:24.880]  What's a back jump?
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.780]  Do a double back jump.
[10:26.920 --> 10:27.800]  Jump backwards.
[10:28.640 --> 10:30.060]  Is that a gymnastics move?
[10:30.540 --> 10:31.180]  Yep.
[10:32.560 --> 10:33.700]  Is that a good throw?
[10:33.800 --> 10:35.840]  Whoa, what a taser toss, baby!
[10:36.060 --> 10:38.940]  Shit, dude.
[10:39.660 --> 10:40.580]  Wow, that's a good throw.
[10:41.580 --> 10:42.280]  Oh, poor Nick.
[10:42.980 --> 10:43.620]  Yes!
[10:46.840 --> 10:50.100]  What the fuck was that?
[10:50.760 --> 10:51.160]  What the fuck was that?
[10:51.740 --> 10:52.520]  You missed.
[10:54.760 --> 10:55.720]  Oh, condo!
[10:57.780 --> 10:58.740]  Oh, condo.
[10:59.280 --> 10:59.760]  Wow.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.600]  Dude, that was crazy.
[11:02.800 --> 11:03.780]  What a crash and burn.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.080]  That was crazy.
[11:07.160 --> 11:08.080]  What's blowing up?
[11:08.180 --> 11:08.560]  What's happening?
[11:09.080 --> 11:12.300]  All stuff that you zapped on the other side of the map.
[11:12.360 --> 11:12.600]  You're good.
[11:13.160 --> 11:15.520]  That was a great battery thing.
[11:16.740 --> 11:17.660]  Uh-oh, we've got a sniper.
[11:19.620 --> 11:21.580]  No, I don't want to do that.
[11:21.680 --> 11:23.760]  Geoff's crafting and giggling.
[11:24.060 --> 11:25.420]  Geoff, are you crafting and giggling?
[11:25.580 --> 11:26.720]  How do you know I'm crafting?
[11:27.520 --> 11:29.360]  The game dogged you in.
[11:29.980 --> 11:31.000]  Ah, son of a bitch.
[11:32.300 --> 11:32.520]  Uh-oh.
[11:34.580 --> 11:35.380]  Okay, firstly, wait.
[11:35.500 --> 11:37.220]  Before you press this...
[11:38.460 --> 11:38.900]  Why?
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.720]  I like it.
[11:41.220 --> 11:41.580]  Get him!
[11:44.220 --> 11:45.580]  No, that's a bug though.
[11:45.960 --> 11:46.380]  Bust her.
[11:46.380 --> 11:47.240]  Oh, yeah!
[11:55.480 --> 11:59.300]  You halved my team.
[12:00.600 --> 12:00.820]  Yes.
[12:00.860 --> 12:01.460]  Oh, man.
[12:01.960 --> 12:04.440]  That's five times worse than decimating my team.
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.880]  Gavin just got indiscriminately doged.
[12:09.520 --> 12:10.820]  Check your inbox, buddy.
[12:10.860 --> 12:11.540]  You knew about it.
[12:11.700 --> 12:13.920]  You have to hire me back a week later, you idiot.
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.600]  Yeah, but this way you'll have leverage and I'll have to pay you more.
[12:17.780 --> 12:18.260]  Yeah.
[12:19.300 --> 12:21.120]  You're fired. I'm sorry.
[12:21.340 --> 12:21.880]  Come back.
[12:22.020 --> 12:22.500]  I'm sorry.
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.940]  It turns out you were an essential service, which is a thing I didn't know about or think about.
[12:28.020 --> 12:28.680]  Please come back.
[12:29.020 --> 12:30.900]  Holy shit, it's a holy hand grenade.
[12:31.520 --> 12:32.200]  Uh-oh.
[12:32.280 --> 12:33.960]  Oh, Nick is flying!
[12:34.920 --> 12:36.820]  Nick might not survive that.
[12:37.220 --> 12:37.360]  Yeah.
[12:37.940 --> 12:40.160]  That was close.
[12:40.940 --> 12:41.420]  Goddamn.
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.300]  Gavin's whole team is right here, dude. Just take them out.
[12:44.560 --> 12:45.060]  Nah, though.
[12:45.900 --> 12:46.960]  Nah, though.
[12:48.260 --> 12:49.100]  Yeah, but no.
[12:49.480 --> 12:50.880]  Yeah, but you don't have to.
[12:55.620 --> 12:56.760]  Come on, Nick.
[12:57.100 --> 12:58.700]  What is Nick gonna do?
[12:59.120 --> 13:00.320]  What's Nick thinking about here?
[13:00.560 --> 13:01.180]  A doo-doo.
[13:03.740 --> 13:04.000]  Alright.
[13:04.340 --> 13:05.540]  I think I know what I'm gonna do.
[13:06.300 --> 13:06.640]  Okay.
[13:09.980 --> 13:11.320]  Beware to do it.
[13:12.320 --> 13:13.560]  Dismantle some crap.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.560]  Oh, wow.
[13:17.440 --> 13:18.000]  Interesting.
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.000]  Another one?
[13:20.440 --> 13:21.840]  I live in a submarine now.
[13:22.320 --> 13:25.220]  I do all my attacks from my home in my submarine.
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.860]  RIP Gene Hackman.
[13:27.500 --> 13:27.700]  Yeah.
[13:29.760 --> 13:31.720]  I guess we killed Gene Hackman, by the way.
[13:31.820 --> 13:32.400]  We did.
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.640]  I is we.
[13:35.900 --> 13:36.960]  I is we.
[13:37.720 --> 13:39.220]  We are a guy.
[13:42.400 --> 13:43.540]  We is not me.
[13:43.740 --> 13:44.020]  It's us.
[13:45.780 --> 13:46.660]  Okay, so...
[13:46.660 --> 13:49.940]  If I put the banana over here...
[13:49.940 --> 13:50.060]  Yeah.
[13:50.620 --> 13:51.920]  That should be fine.
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.080]  I'm gonna...
[13:54.080 --> 13:55.340]  You think any of the...
[13:57.240 --> 13:58.200]  You got it.
[13:58.580 --> 13:59.100]  You got it.
[13:59.700 --> 14:00.660]  Don't worry about it.
[14:00.720 --> 14:04.200]  ...posts of Gene Hackman reference Welcome to Mooseport?
[14:04.820 --> 14:06.460]  You know where they always pick, like, two movies?
[14:07.280 --> 14:08.340]  Probably not a lot.
[14:08.340 --> 14:09.420]  Why on Patreon?
[14:09.640 --> 14:11.120]  Why did you do it on Patreon?
[14:11.440 --> 14:12.920]  Oh my God.
[14:12.980 --> 14:14.180]  That's how he feels about our Patreon.
[14:15.440 --> 14:18.520]  Oh, party!
[14:19.660 --> 14:19.980]  Party!
[14:23.580 --> 14:25.220]  Party, no!
[14:26.620 --> 14:27.460]  Oh, there goes Andrew.
[14:28.240 --> 14:28.440]  No!
[14:30.140 --> 14:31.100]  Another me?
[14:31.580 --> 14:34.400]  I may have blown the second round of Narnias a little too soon there.
[14:34.840 --> 14:35.120]  Yeah.
[14:37.140 --> 14:37.540]  Shit.
[14:37.540 --> 14:39.960]  I think that's the first time I've not killed myself with one, though.
[14:40.060 --> 14:40.600]  Which is nice.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.940]  That's cool.
[14:45.140 --> 14:46.640]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[14:47.280 --> 14:49.100]  Does anybody have any bargy sauce I can borrow?
[14:50.080 --> 14:50.880]  Bargy sauce?
[14:51.460 --> 14:51.760]  Yeah.
[14:52.300 --> 14:53.400]  Oh, for the crafting?
[14:53.780 --> 14:54.120]  Yeah.
[14:54.900 --> 14:59.260]  Okay, you're throwing them kind of near my only two herbs, so I'd ask that maybe...
[14:59.260 --> 15:01.780]  How do I tilt up? Is it just like a walking thing?
[15:03.080 --> 15:03.720]  Uh, yeah.
[15:03.780 --> 15:04.640]  You have to walk up.
[15:04.640 --> 15:05.980]  Keep walking up.
[15:06.280 --> 15:07.260]  Oh, there we go.
[15:08.400 --> 15:10.680]  Now you're aiming into my worms.
[15:11.100 --> 15:11.360]  No!
[15:13.660 --> 15:14.160]  No!
[15:14.680 --> 15:16.300]  I tried to get the bopper!
[15:17.840 --> 15:18.860]  I tried to get the bopper!
[15:19.340 --> 15:21.240]  I didn't realize someone was in the bopper.
[15:21.460 --> 15:22.340]  I had a whole plan.
[15:23.340 --> 15:24.780]  Well, it went a certain way.
[15:25.180 --> 15:25.440]  Wow.
[15:26.160 --> 15:27.400]  Yeah, I would say sideways.
[15:27.760 --> 15:28.300]  Bye, Nick.
[15:29.760 --> 15:30.600]  Bye, Patreon.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.400]  Thanks to the rigid...
[15:34.340 --> 15:36.240]  Rigid surface of the holy hand grenade.
[15:37.180 --> 15:38.020]  Oh, man.
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.620]  Almost a really good jump.
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.360]  Here we go.
[15:42.460 --> 15:45.740]  There we go.
[15:46.740 --> 15:49.000]  Okay, we're just gonna get in.
[15:50.480 --> 15:51.240]  Jump across!
[15:52.540 --> 15:53.280]  Pretty good jump.
[15:53.460 --> 15:53.800]  Pretty good.
[15:55.120 --> 15:56.680]  There we go.
[15:56.820 --> 15:57.220]  You got it.
[15:58.020 --> 15:58.980]  There you go.
[15:58.980 --> 15:59.760]  Way to go.
[16:05.780 --> 16:07.080]  How do I get out?
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.020]  Well, that vehicle's broken.
[16:10.220 --> 16:10.560]  Shit.
[16:14.180 --> 16:15.000]  There you go!
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.620]  Oh, my God!
[16:17.940 --> 16:18.460]  Wow.
[16:18.760 --> 16:19.060]  Probably?
[16:21.360 --> 16:21.580]  Nope.
[16:23.400 --> 16:23.760]  Nice.
[16:28.050 --> 16:28.770]  I didn't like that.
[16:28.770 --> 16:31.430]  That's fair. I wouldn't like that if I were you, either.
[16:32.930 --> 16:34.410]  I get coming back at me.
[16:35.510 --> 16:37.070]  Unfortunately for you...
[16:37.070 --> 16:37.810]  Oh, God.
[16:38.030 --> 16:39.330]  This is a suicide worm.
[16:39.870 --> 16:41.890]  Oh, no.
[16:42.590 --> 16:43.270]  Do a backflip!
[16:44.070 --> 16:45.070]  Holy shit!
[16:45.450 --> 16:45.970]  Wow!
[16:47.670 --> 16:49.510]  I think Bopper's gonna be okay.
[16:50.210 --> 16:52.250]  I lost two dudes there, but I...
[16:53.310 --> 16:53.930]  It was fun.
[16:54.770 --> 16:56.470]  They both had no health. Didn't matter.
[17:00.830 --> 17:03.390]  I need to get some of my worms a little safer.
[17:04.050 --> 17:04.570]  Oh.
[17:04.890 --> 17:07.510]  Audio says what POV we're watching.
[17:07.670 --> 17:08.450]  Is this Andrew's POV?
[17:09.170 --> 17:09.890]  No, this is mine.
[17:10.010 --> 17:10.210]  Yeah.
[17:13.850 --> 17:15.670]  This is Gavin's POV.
[17:16.330 --> 17:18.790]  I think Geoff is just saying stuff.
[17:18.850 --> 17:20.710]  I don't think Geoff knows what POV means.
[17:29.230 --> 17:31.050]  I enjoyed that. Let's do a little bit more of that.
[17:31.750 --> 17:33.190]  Oh, you're going into the bus?
[17:34.450 --> 17:36.270]  Yeah, does the bus have a little hole?
[17:36.430 --> 17:36.950]  Like a little entrance?
[17:37.950 --> 17:38.290]  Beep, beep.
[17:40.950 --> 17:41.310]  No!
[17:43.050 --> 17:44.030]  There's a bomb in here!
[17:44.130 --> 17:44.870]  There's a bomb in here!
[17:45.110 --> 17:45.210]  Ow!
[17:45.850 --> 17:49.990]  Just checking to see if it had an entrance or not, Gavin.
[17:50.330 --> 17:50.690]  Shit!
[17:50.690 --> 17:53.550]  A little blip gone, I didn't notice it!
[17:54.590 --> 17:55.970]  Did it have an entrance or what?
[17:56.310 --> 17:56.990]  Uh, there was one.
[17:57.530 --> 17:58.050]  Oh, okay.
[17:58.130 --> 17:59.930]  I got helped in eventually by some bullets.
[18:00.570 --> 18:01.670]  Yeah, that happens.
[18:02.150 --> 18:02.510]  Shit.
[18:07.170 --> 18:10.550]  Deadly robe it with the idiot flags after that turn.
[18:12.610 --> 18:13.230]  Let's see.
[18:13.310 --> 18:14.670]  What are we looking at?
[18:14.790 --> 18:15.310]  That's deserved.
[18:16.350 --> 18:17.050]  Fair enough.
[18:18.710 --> 18:20.930]  I think we're gonna grundle milk it.
[18:20.950 --> 18:22.190]  Oh, you're gonna grundle milk it?
[18:22.230 --> 18:23.490]  What do you have against my grundle milk?
[18:23.490 --> 18:24.730]  Oh, you're gonna turn into a shake!
[18:25.630 --> 18:26.190]  Grundle shake!
[18:27.810 --> 18:28.550]  Was that 30?
[18:28.790 --> 18:29.070]  What?
[18:32.250 --> 18:33.570]  Grundle milk's strong, dude.
[18:33.650 --> 18:35.890]  It's called a bunker buster, and I was not underground.
[18:36.690 --> 18:38.010]  Yeah, well, I thought maybe it would
[18:38.010 --> 18:39.590]  turn you into a bunker, you get busted.
[18:39.810 --> 18:41.010]  Oh, like a bunker maker?
[18:41.670 --> 18:42.010]  Yeah.
[18:44.510 --> 18:46.010]  I'm still in this stupid car.
[18:49.250 --> 18:49.830]  Fuck it.
[18:49.990 --> 18:52.110]  Still in this stupid car.
[18:53.990 --> 18:55.270]  Oh, you just destroyed...
[18:55.270 --> 18:56.070]  That should collapse.
[18:56.510 --> 18:57.110]  That's ridiculous.
[19:01.930 --> 19:02.330]  Okay.
[19:02.730 --> 19:05.490]  Well, it's where I live now.
[19:06.350 --> 19:07.170]  Oh, that's cool.
[19:08.490 --> 19:09.730]  Ooh, some stuff.
[19:09.850 --> 19:10.490]  Oh, dang.
[19:10.910 --> 19:11.650]  That is some stuff.
[19:11.810 --> 19:14.390]  And I can't go get it, because I'll get shot.
[19:15.190 --> 19:15.990]  It's Nick.
[19:16.870 --> 19:17.710]  Let's see.
[19:19.450 --> 19:20.810]  You know what I'm gonna do?
[19:21.290 --> 19:21.950]  What are you gonna do?
[19:22.870 --> 19:24.390]  See how this goes.
[19:24.970 --> 19:26.910]  Just jump.
[19:27.910 --> 19:28.190]  There you go.
[19:28.250 --> 19:29.410]  I can't fucking move.
[19:30.310 --> 19:30.730]  There you go.
[19:32.710 --> 19:33.390]  Parachute?
[19:34.910 --> 19:36.270]  Bill Bagg.
[19:37.270 --> 19:38.470]  Where's she gonna go?
[19:39.270 --> 19:40.570]  Oh my god.
[19:41.730 --> 19:43.090]  Oh, did Bob get stinked?
[19:43.090 --> 19:45.330]  He got a little stink.
[19:46.030 --> 19:46.330]  Uh-oh.
[19:49.030 --> 19:50.370]  Oh, it's Grundle Milk.
[19:51.130 --> 19:53.670]  Grundle Milk needs him some...
[19:53.670 --> 19:53.990]  health.
[19:58.830 --> 20:02.890]  That is the funniest fucking audience question I've seen in a long time.
[20:03.370 --> 20:03.590]  Yeah?
[20:03.830 --> 20:06.910]  Do you think that bomb was spelled without the B
[20:06.910 --> 20:08.390]  and then someone got paid $8,000?
[20:08.930 --> 20:12.890]  I gotta go with yeah.
[20:13.310 --> 20:14.290]  I think so.
[20:14.390 --> 20:14.930]  I do now.
[20:15.410 --> 20:16.850]  Alright, check this out.
[20:18.230 --> 20:19.330]  Banana bomb?
[20:20.330 --> 20:20.870]  Not a bomb.
[20:21.610 --> 20:22.510]  Going long?
[20:23.910 --> 20:24.530]  I think it's a little...
[20:25.190 --> 20:26.610]  Oh, it didn't go far enough.
[20:28.550 --> 20:29.370]  Oh, Gavin.
[20:29.810 --> 20:30.290]  Oh no!
[20:30.790 --> 20:32.110]  Oh, Grundle Milk.
[20:34.090 --> 20:36.110]  You might even seed yourself.
[20:36.630 --> 20:37.690]  Could've been worse for you.
[20:37.690 --> 20:38.810]  That could've been worse.
[20:39.390 --> 20:42.830]  I knew the second it left my hand it was bad, but...
[20:42.830 --> 20:43.570]  Got away with it.
[20:43.750 --> 20:45.190]  Good news for you, you're not gonna have any cramps.
[20:46.010 --> 20:47.530]  That was way more than three banana.
[20:50.310 --> 20:51.530]  How do we wanna do this, boys?
[20:52.190 --> 20:53.490]  How many was it? Five? Six?
[20:53.890 --> 20:54.810]  At least six.
[20:55.550 --> 20:56.270]  Six potassiums?
[20:57.650 --> 20:58.550]  Monkeys only eat two.
[21:00.430 --> 21:01.090]  There he is.
[21:03.470 --> 21:04.130]  Yeah, do that.
[21:12.310 --> 21:12.830]  Okay.
[21:13.130 --> 21:16.230]  I regret teaching you how to use the Bunker Buster.
[21:18.950 --> 21:20.550]  Oh, I'm burning up!
[21:20.870 --> 21:21.150]  No!
[21:22.870 --> 21:24.910]  Oh, you should've gone just a little bit further.
[21:27.070 --> 21:27.590]  Shit.
[21:28.130 --> 21:28.870]  That was so cool.
[21:30.750 --> 21:31.530]  Nice, 75.
[21:31.530 --> 21:33.050]  You really messed him up.
[21:33.330 --> 21:35.710]  That was Geoff saying, son of a...
[21:37.590 --> 21:38.690]  I did...
[21:38.690 --> 21:40.830]  I picked the Achievement Hunter voice tracks.
[21:43.090 --> 21:44.410]  Oh, look at that.
[21:44.990 --> 21:45.470]  Nice.
[21:47.510 --> 21:48.970]  Okay, well...
[21:48.970 --> 21:49.530]  I'm trying to...
[21:49.530 --> 21:51.150]  God damn it!
[21:51.750 --> 21:53.130]  Come on, man, you got it.
[21:53.770 --> 21:55.650]  The Captain Curry with the gifted subs.
[21:55.750 --> 21:57.810]  This is humming through big style.
[21:58.090 --> 21:58.550]  Thank you very much.
[22:00.030 --> 22:03.750]  What if Captain Curry was Steph Curry's, like...
[22:03.750 --> 22:04.630]  Fenced account?
[22:05.990 --> 22:07.070]  That'd be pretty cool.
[22:07.130 --> 22:09.550]  Steph Curry's a big regulation community member.
[22:09.850 --> 22:10.350]  I'd like it.
[22:10.710 --> 22:13.170]  Let us know if we can get some tickets, dude.
[22:14.470 --> 22:15.410]  We like you more than your brother.
[22:16.410 --> 22:16.550]  Oh.
[22:17.830 --> 22:18.570]  Here we go.
[22:18.850 --> 22:20.990]  I got nothing against Steph Curry.
[22:21.210 --> 22:21.630]  Here we go.
[22:23.410 --> 22:24.830]  That's a ledge right there.
[22:25.350 --> 22:25.590]  What?
[22:26.450 --> 22:27.390]  Excuse me?
[22:29.490 --> 22:29.970]  No!
[22:30.790 --> 22:31.270]  No!
[22:34.430 --> 22:34.950]  Impressive.
[22:34.950 --> 22:36.010]  That's what I'm talking about.
[22:36.130 --> 22:37.110]  Man, a bomb.
[22:37.670 --> 22:38.510]  Damn, dude.
[22:39.530 --> 22:40.050]  Wow.
[22:40.650 --> 22:41.690]  That was a good one.
[22:42.430 --> 22:43.650]  I'll never do that again.
[22:46.130 --> 22:47.430]  Gizmo throwing heat.
[22:48.350 --> 22:49.850]  That draws a lot of health.
[22:50.730 --> 22:52.150]  But not a lot of worms.
[22:52.570 --> 22:53.730]  Which I think is important to note.
[22:58.190 --> 22:59.430]  What will Nick do?
[23:01.810 --> 23:02.190]  Uh!
[23:04.190 --> 23:05.430]  Eric is crafting.
[23:05.970 --> 23:06.350]  Yeah.
[23:08.990 --> 23:11.710]  I have such a great strategy lined up.
[23:11.830 --> 23:13.050]  That is not going to work.
[23:13.250 --> 23:13.930]  This is not going to happen.
[23:14.570 --> 23:15.630]  You think someone's going to mess it up?
[23:15.950 --> 23:18.350]  I think I don't know how the game works.
[23:18.450 --> 23:19.970]  And this is not going to let me do what I want to do.
[23:20.050 --> 23:22.270]  I don't know how the game works.
[23:24.310 --> 23:24.570]  What?
[23:24.650 --> 23:25.230]  Where is this?
[23:25.390 --> 23:26.890]  What is going on here?
[23:27.410 --> 23:29.410]  Holiday Hippie says you should play Towerfall online.
[23:29.550 --> 23:31.190]  I'm pretty sure it doesn't have...
[23:31.190 --> 23:31.910]  I don't think it does, does it?
[23:32.050 --> 23:34.550]  Yeah, I think it's local.
[23:36.910 --> 23:37.090]  Oh!
[23:37.590 --> 23:37.910]  Damn!
[23:39.410 --> 23:40.050]  Very good!
[23:42.110 --> 23:42.950]  That caught him.
[23:43.590 --> 23:44.590]  That's pretty good, Geoff.
[23:45.010 --> 23:46.230]  He even got Mario down there.
[23:46.270 --> 23:46.850]  That was crazy.
[23:48.710 --> 23:50.290]  I thought I overcooked it a little bit, but that was alright.
[23:50.510 --> 23:51.150]  You killed one!
[23:52.450 --> 23:53.390]  You killed me!
[23:53.390 --> 23:54.570]  What the fuck?
[23:55.010 --> 23:57.910]  Good God!
[23:58.690 --> 23:59.310]  I like bananas.
[24:00.550 --> 24:01.370]  Cryptic, Cassie!
[24:01.370 --> 24:04.250]  That banana bomb was not a 7, I'll tell you that.
[24:04.610 --> 24:08.630]  I'm a Knudstrup with another 10 gifted subs.
[24:09.130 --> 24:09.810]  Jesus Christ.
[24:11.750 --> 24:13.750]  The rats are out in full force, baby.
[24:14.110 --> 24:15.610]  Grindle milk is my only worm.
[24:17.970 --> 24:18.790]  That's rough.
[24:21.450 --> 24:23.370]  It's just not what you want.
[24:24.590 --> 24:25.950]  Oh no, that's you.
[24:26.190 --> 24:28.450]  It's not the worm situation you want to find yourself in.
[24:30.390 --> 24:31.370]  Yeah, it's rough.
[24:31.610 --> 24:33.690]  LOL, it's 10pm when the stream starts for me.
[24:33.970 --> 24:34.010]  Move.
[24:37.010 --> 24:38.610]  Okay, that is...
[24:38.610 --> 24:39.350]  I'm just going to stay here.
[24:39.590 --> 24:40.850]  Time to consider options.
[24:41.190 --> 24:42.130]  Different countries, different places.
[24:42.550 --> 24:43.270]  Are you going to grenade it?
[24:43.490 --> 24:44.030]  Oh no!
[24:45.390 --> 24:45.870]  Yes!
[24:46.250 --> 24:46.410]  No?
[24:46.960 --> 24:47.350]  No?
[24:48.290 --> 24:49.070]  No?
[24:51.250 --> 24:52.810]  Get stinked!
[24:53.250 --> 24:53.350]  No!
[24:53.470 --> 24:54.210]  No!
[24:55.890 --> 24:56.670]  No!
[24:59.150 --> 24:59.770]  Oh no!
[25:01.130 --> 25:01.910]  Wow!
[25:02.790 --> 25:04.310]  Don't drift my way!
[25:04.490 --> 25:05.550]  Vehicle do not blow up!
[25:05.850 --> 25:07.090]  I need you to stay in!
[25:09.060 --> 25:09.930]  Bopper stay!
[25:13.370 --> 25:14.150]  Oh!
[25:14.150 --> 25:14.410]  Oh!
[25:17.330 --> 25:19.850]  I don't think Party's going to go up there and get that.
[25:24.010 --> 25:25.250]  It's Mario himself.
[25:25.590 --> 25:26.770]  No! Yes!
[25:28.070 --> 25:29.150]  Well, I don't know what the fuck.
[25:29.230 --> 25:30.370]  That's what I did.
[25:31.810 --> 25:32.550]  Hang on, I'm thinking.
[25:32.690 --> 25:33.010]  Yes!
[25:33.990 --> 25:35.770]  What do you mean? It's my only worm!
[25:36.030 --> 25:36.530]  What do you mean?
[25:38.210 --> 25:39.950]  We're all down to one worm!
[25:40.110 --> 25:42.550]  Alright, 261, that one's for you!
[25:44.470 --> 25:45.030]  Shit!
[25:47.230 --> 25:48.670]  What do you mean that's my only worm?
[25:51.630 --> 25:52.190]  Auron261!
[25:52.530 --> 25:53.990]  Thanks for the 10 gifted subs!
[25:54.470 --> 25:55.450]  I did that for you.
[25:56.450 --> 25:57.370]  For Auron?
[25:57.910 --> 25:58.190]  Yeah.
[26:02.890 --> 26:05.230]  This has got to stop.
[26:07.430 --> 26:08.970]  What are you doing?
[26:09.030 --> 26:09.790]  That was a mistake.
[26:09.790 --> 26:10.650]  What are you?
[26:11.070 --> 26:15.650]  A little spicy out there?
[26:16.470 --> 26:18.990]  I didn't know it would destroy the crate as well.
[26:19.090 --> 26:20.090]  I just wanted the crate.
[26:20.970 --> 26:22.710]  I'm trying to get out of here.
[26:22.850 --> 26:24.570]  I have a plan and I need to get higher.
[26:25.030 --> 26:27.290]  I have a plan!
[26:29.050 --> 26:30.430]  Okay, let's see.
[26:31.410 --> 26:34.550]  I can use the jetpack
[26:34.550 --> 26:36.570]  and then any other attack, right?
[26:36.810 --> 26:37.050]  Yeah.
[26:37.050 --> 26:38.730]  You can even use them at the same time.
[26:39.110 --> 26:40.530]  I don't need to do that.
[26:42.330 --> 26:43.730]  15 gifted subs!
[26:43.930 --> 26:45.790]  This move is dedicated to you.
[26:46.170 --> 26:46.850]  I don't need to move.
[26:47.910 --> 26:50.670]  This is also dedicated to you.
[26:52.350 --> 26:53.470]  What are you doing?
[26:54.210 --> 26:55.450]  I was looking at the...
[26:55.450 --> 26:56.230]  Where is it going?
[26:57.970 --> 26:58.330]  Okay.
[26:59.030 --> 26:59.510]  Mario!
[27:00.830 --> 27:02.850]  Too much health there with 148.
[27:03.090 --> 27:05.250]  How are we supposed to tell people that
[27:05.250 --> 27:07.810]  Mario Party March is on Patreon starting tomorrow.
[27:08.090 --> 27:09.410]  And if you're watching this on Tuesday,
[27:09.550 --> 27:11.270]  you already have some days that you can catch up on
[27:11.270 --> 27:13.950]  by going to patreon.com slash theregulationpod
[27:13.950 --> 27:15.410]  signing up for a free membership
[27:15.410 --> 27:16.630]  and watching them for free.
[27:16.750 --> 27:18.710]  I think it just can't be done, Eric.
[27:18.890 --> 27:19.210]  Damn.
[27:22.030 --> 27:24.270]  Bobby Bruschi says he's never seen so many gifted subs
[27:24.270 --> 27:25.030]  on any stream ever.
[27:25.170 --> 27:26.210]  Jesus Christ, how many were there?
[27:27.770 --> 27:30.110]  I've been worm strategizing.
[27:31.210 --> 27:31.870]  Are you worming?
[27:32.090 --> 27:32.450]  Yeah.
[27:32.450 --> 27:34.130]  Are you worming and squirming, bro?
[27:34.370 --> 27:36.790]  I'm worming and wubbing, and you guys don't even know about that.
[27:36.830 --> 27:37.970]  We don't even know what that is.
[27:38.190 --> 27:40.550]  Stop saying it.
[27:41.250 --> 27:42.550]  You will. You'll know.
[27:42.730 --> 27:44.190]  I've got four swings left.
[27:45.810 --> 27:47.370]  Okay, let's see. Where are the people?
[27:47.630 --> 27:48.490]  There you go.
[27:48.730 --> 27:50.390]  I'm not going to hit anyone with that one. Are you an idiot?
[27:50.530 --> 27:52.310]  Yeah, you got it. Big toss. Let's go.
[27:53.150 --> 27:54.450]  Give it everything you got, baby.
[27:54.570 --> 27:55.870]  The wind is on your side, dude.
[27:56.150 --> 27:59.950]  Six seconds. Five. Toss. Four. Three.
[28:00.130 --> 28:00.850]  Everything you got!
[28:00.850 --> 28:03.370]  Well, that was not far enough.
[28:03.450 --> 28:05.830]  What a stupid toss. Why'd you do that?
[28:07.050 --> 28:08.350]  The angle wasn't great.
[28:08.550 --> 28:09.730]  The speed wasn't good.
[28:10.030 --> 28:11.850]  The power was lacking.
[28:13.010 --> 28:14.190]  I'm no threat.
[28:14.490 --> 28:15.990]  I'm no threat in this game.
[28:20.150 --> 28:21.610]  Oh, it's Party's turn.
[28:21.890 --> 28:22.290]  Interesting.
[28:22.870 --> 28:25.750]  That was me saying, ah, what, to my own turn.
[28:27.890 --> 28:29.950]  Screwed myself for eight years in the past.
[28:30.510 --> 28:31.070]  No!
[28:31.710 --> 28:32.850]  Without hitting me.
[28:33.010 --> 28:35.450]  No, my plan's about to come together!
[28:36.650 --> 28:37.690]  I've been planning!
[28:38.430 --> 28:39.270]  Is this a triple?
[28:39.750 --> 28:40.890]  No, the plan!
[28:42.590 --> 28:44.210]  Oh my God.
[28:44.210 --> 28:45.730]  I can't believe it didn't hit him.
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.310]  I cannot believe it didn't hit him.
[28:48.490 --> 28:48.770]  Oh!
[28:49.510 --> 28:49.930]  No!
[28:53.890 --> 28:56.970]  That drop looks like Wolverine just clawed the map.
[28:57.210 --> 28:58.950]  Yeah! He went claws out, baby.
[29:02.330 --> 29:02.810]  Snicked!
[29:06.650 --> 29:08.510]  He's a lunatic.
[29:09.630 --> 29:10.190]  Are you girding?
[29:10.570 --> 29:11.710]  He's girding.
[29:12.630 --> 29:13.350]  He's trying.
[29:14.430 --> 29:15.850]  That was my fear.
[29:19.840 --> 29:20.940]  Alright, here we go.
[29:21.700 --> 29:22.680]  Andrew, I want you to know
[29:22.680 --> 29:24.580]  that I wanted to attack you, but I'm not
[29:24.580 --> 29:26.180]  going to because I realize
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.040]  that if I kill you,
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.700]  Eric's just going to decimate us.
[29:30.700 --> 29:33.500]  It's also a thing where I'm going to kill
[29:33.500 --> 29:35.580]  myself in two turns, so you don't have to worry
[29:35.580 --> 29:36.760]  about it.
[29:36.840 --> 29:37.920]  I'm going to fall.
[29:38.820 --> 29:40.240]  What to do, though?
[29:44.530 --> 29:45.630]  No, that's Mario.
[29:45.790 --> 29:46.630]  Leave Mario alone.
[29:47.090 --> 29:47.870]  Mario, no!
[29:50.550 --> 29:51.050]  Mario!
[29:51.530 --> 29:51.770]  Run!
[29:52.430 --> 29:53.990]  I think he's still probably alive, though.
[29:54.550 --> 29:55.970]  They stopped making that.
[30:01.010 --> 30:02.550]  Alright, I gotta move.
[30:02.550 --> 30:04.530]  I'm going to be a worm
[30:04.530 --> 30:06.390]  who wants his freedom.
[30:07.630 --> 30:08.630]  TigerDriver5 gifted,
[30:08.890 --> 30:10.450]  this one is dedicated to you.
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.660]  Everything Gavin's doing
[30:14.660 --> 30:16.960]  right now is your fault, so just consider that.
[30:17.300 --> 30:17.560]  It is.
[30:18.760 --> 30:20.400]  TigerDriver, you're doing this.
[30:20.840 --> 30:22.580]  Look at what you're doing.
[30:22.920 --> 30:24.520]  Look at what your support has done.
[30:28.960 --> 30:30.160]  He missed!
[30:30.940 --> 30:31.960]  He ran out of slack!
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.700]  You moron.
[30:33.700 --> 30:34.360]  Okay.
[30:36.340 --> 30:37.620]  Still got one of these.
[30:38.140 --> 30:38.900]  No harm done.
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.080]  Plenty of fun.
[30:41.420 --> 30:43.300]  All the way up!
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.440]  All the way down, baby!
[30:45.820 --> 30:48.400]  That's a great toss.
[30:48.540 --> 30:49.460]  Not even close.
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.560]  Not even close.
[30:51.660 --> 30:53.600]  Right in the water.
[30:54.820 --> 30:56.740]  What a bad turn that was.
[30:57.020 --> 30:57.700]  Soggy bomb.
[30:58.740 --> 31:00.540]  That might be the last thing you do in this game.
[31:01.060 --> 31:01.300]  Yeah.
[31:01.300 --> 31:03.060]  That sounds pretty threatening.
[31:03.360 --> 31:05.240]  Not from me, from fucking Eric.
[31:05.640 --> 31:05.820]  Oh.
[31:08.480 --> 31:09.140]  Let's see.
[31:10.560 --> 31:12.420]  He's got the best shot of all of Gavin,
[31:12.500 --> 31:13.540]  but he's going to go for it.
[31:13.540 --> 31:13.580]  Fuck!
[31:15.420 --> 31:16.420]  Oh, that gets the gun!
[31:16.700 --> 31:18.840]  I thought one was going to get down in there.
[31:20.180 --> 31:21.340]  You got me.
[31:21.600 --> 31:24.260]  But Andrew, your girder saved your fucking life, buddy.
[31:24.320 --> 31:24.680]  Congratulations.
[31:24.960 --> 31:26.340]  Oh, my girder worked!
[31:29.500 --> 31:29.780]  Oh!
[31:30.540 --> 31:32.220]  I'm pretty sure I just saved Geoff a little bit, though.
[31:32.720 --> 31:33.140]  No, I'm dead.
[31:33.280 --> 31:33.760]  No, he's dead.
[31:33.760 --> 31:36.080]  Yeah, I know he died, but I didn't think it was going to hit you, was it?
[31:37.900 --> 31:38.460]  I don't know.
[31:38.500 --> 31:39.760]  It took out half the bombs.
[31:42.160 --> 31:43.760]  I don't think any of it was going to hit Andrew.
[31:43.860 --> 31:44.860]  Yeah, I think it was all going to hit.
[31:45.260 --> 31:46.960]  Yeah, I thought it was going to get a little bit closer.
[31:48.160 --> 31:48.720]  Oh, jetpack.
[31:49.060 --> 31:49.520]  Oh, wow.
[31:51.340 --> 31:52.060]  Don't overshoot it.
[31:56.810 --> 31:57.090]  Nice.
[31:57.690 --> 31:58.210]  See ya.
[31:58.470 --> 31:59.450]  Oh, no.
[31:59.470 --> 31:59.790]  What?
[32:02.830 --> 32:04.230]  It's not real anymore!
[32:05.230 --> 32:07.690]  I don't think you can land on it, buddy.
[32:08.530 --> 32:09.130]  Fuck!
[32:11.170 --> 32:12.810]  How are you doing?
[32:13.030 --> 32:13.750]  Chief Justice!
[32:14.370 --> 32:14.690]  No!
[32:16.750 --> 32:18.730]  You said it the wrong way.
[32:18.930 --> 32:19.530]  Where is he going?
[32:20.650 --> 32:20.930]  No!
[32:21.430 --> 32:22.570]  Conan Grendel!
[32:23.130 --> 32:24.390]  Conan Grendel!
[32:25.170 --> 32:25.510]  No!
[32:26.270 --> 32:27.970]  All the way to Grendel!
[32:28.310 --> 32:29.630]  No, you fucking idiot!
[32:30.830 --> 32:32.350]  You useless sheep!
[32:33.230 --> 32:34.930]  Oron, this one's for you!
[32:40.370 --> 32:40.930]  Wow.
[32:42.370 --> 32:45.530]  I gotta say, I really appreciate the girder move.
[32:46.350 --> 32:46.590]  Yeah.
[32:46.610 --> 32:48.610]  To land up on the girder, that's class.
[32:52.650 --> 32:53.690]  Oh, right by Mario.
[32:55.370 --> 32:56.530]  Rich get richer.
[32:58.750 --> 32:59.690]  That's what they say.
[33:03.910 --> 33:04.310]  Right.
[33:04.450 --> 33:06.350]  How am I gonna do anything?
[33:06.510 --> 33:08.490]  No jetpack, no...
[33:09.670 --> 33:10.070]  ropes.
[33:17.420 --> 33:19.120]  I know we're not doing it today, obviously,
[33:19.300 --> 33:21.820]  but whose job is it to monitor the monkey mask right now?
[33:22.880 --> 33:23.480]  I think it's mine.
[33:24.120 --> 33:24.360]  Okay.
[33:24.520 --> 33:25.360]  My wife's spring.
[33:25.360 --> 33:27.860]  I think I'm Q1.
[33:27.960 --> 33:28.700]  I'm Q2.
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.220]  I'm Q3.
[33:30.620 --> 33:31.300]  Damn!
[33:34.320 --> 33:34.900]  Wow!
[33:35.900 --> 33:36.680]  Party's toast!
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.700]  Did you have to dismantle stuff to make that?
[33:39.280 --> 33:40.440]  No, it just unlocked.
[33:40.840 --> 33:41.680]  The stinky one I did.
[33:43.940 --> 33:45.000]  That's brutal.
[33:51.520 --> 33:51.860]  Uh-oh.
[33:52.740 --> 33:53.620]  Uh-oh!
[33:53.800 --> 33:54.580]  It's sink time.
[33:56.900 --> 33:57.580]  Dang.
[34:00.600 --> 34:01.380]  Damn it.
[34:01.440 --> 34:03.700]  I'm being teased by all this...
[34:04.360 --> 34:05.460]  all this health.
[34:09.700 --> 34:11.140]  Oh, you got water shoes?
[34:11.200 --> 34:11.920]  You can walk on water.
[34:13.420 --> 34:14.080]  Woo-hoo!
[34:19.770 --> 34:20.750]  Uh-oh.
[34:20.890 --> 34:21.790]  Oh, God.
[34:22.710 --> 34:23.290]  Oh, no!
[34:24.470 --> 34:25.390]  Now who?
[34:25.510 --> 34:27.670]  Is that a stinky one? Is that green?
[34:28.050 --> 34:28.930]  Now who?
[34:30.390 --> 34:31.210]  Now who?
[34:31.650 --> 34:34.210]  Or is it just because Eric's green turn?
[34:34.750 --> 34:35.590]  Who could it be?
[34:36.170 --> 34:37.510]  Who could it be?
[34:38.370 --> 34:39.990]  There's a 50% chance.
[34:40.570 --> 34:40.810]  Yep.
[34:42.190 --> 34:42.950]  Good luck, boys.
[34:48.290 --> 34:50.250]  I'd leave far away.
[34:51.850 --> 34:53.110]  What do I do?
[34:53.330 --> 34:54.490]  Sheep's ready to go.
[34:57.410 --> 34:57.970]  No!
[35:00.650 --> 35:01.130]  No!
[35:05.390 --> 35:06.410]  Wait, where'd that go?
[35:08.310 --> 35:09.690]  Where did that go?
[35:10.890 --> 35:11.790]  Wait, where am I?
[35:12.310 --> 35:13.210]  You're dead!
[35:13.610 --> 35:15.070]  Wait, I didn't even see it.
[35:15.070 --> 35:16.430]  It didn't even shoot on my screen.
[35:16.670 --> 35:16.850]  Why?
[35:19.970 --> 35:22.490]  That was the best case scenario for Eric.
[35:22.610 --> 35:24.330]  I did nothing and he killed you.
[35:24.730 --> 35:26.490]  Did anyone even see what happened?
[35:26.850 --> 35:27.950]  Son of a bitch!
[35:28.550 --> 35:29.690]  Yeah, you died.
[35:29.830 --> 35:31.310]  That was bullshit!
[35:33.050 --> 35:34.610]  Oh, leave me alone!
[35:36.370 --> 35:37.230]  Oh, no!
[35:38.190 --> 35:41.210]  You got to give the people what they want.
[35:41.730 --> 35:42.110]  Oh, no.
[35:42.110 --> 35:44.170]  What did anyone want that you just did?
[35:44.630 --> 35:45.170]  I win.
[35:46.390 --> 35:48.250]  No, no, I'm good.
[35:48.950 --> 35:49.430]  No!
[35:50.230 --> 35:51.630]  Daddy wins again, baby!
[35:51.810 --> 35:54.350]  Alright, let's celebrate with some piss rats in the chat.
[35:54.470 --> 35:55.430]  Eric loves his piss.
[35:55.430 --> 35:57.470]  Eric identifies as a rat.
[35:57.830 --> 35:59.890]  Eric piss rat.
[36:00.470 --> 36:01.790]  Alright, little corn cats.
[36:02.210 --> 36:03.170]  Because I'm so powerful.
[36:03.610 --> 36:06.890]  Corn cats for the true believers, baby.
[36:07.390 --> 36:08.770]  Piss rats if you want another game.
[36:09.290 --> 36:10.460]  Corn cat if...
[36:11.310 --> 36:12.490]  You want to stay in the stream early.
[36:13.390 --> 36:15.070]  There's nothing behind that.
[36:15.330 --> 36:16.500]  Corn cat if you're fucking...
[36:16.850 --> 36:17.050]  I don't know.
[36:19.690 --> 36:21.290]  We got to do it again.
[36:21.610 --> 36:22.610]  That was awesome.
[36:22.610 --> 36:24.790]  That was great. Top worm, baby.
[36:24.990 --> 36:26.990]  All the way at the top.
[36:27.770 --> 36:29.150]  Top worm! Look at that.
[36:29.570 --> 36:30.570]  I want to add an honor rule.
[36:31.590 --> 36:33.850]  If you end the game with an airstrike,
[36:34.110 --> 36:35.190]  you're a little baby.
[36:36.110 --> 36:37.210]  Oh, yeah, I don't care.
[36:37.570 --> 36:39.310]  Does not matter to me.
[36:39.410 --> 36:40.530]  Absolutely. 100%.
[36:40.530 --> 36:42.830]  Don't give a fuck. Yeah, absolutely.
[36:43.490 --> 36:43.770]  Yep.
[36:44.710 --> 36:47.090]  Does not matter to me whatsoever.
[36:47.330 --> 36:47.950]  100%, dude.
[36:48.130 --> 36:49.210]  You don't mind being a little baby?
[36:49.890 --> 36:50.770]  Yeah, no, I don't care.
[36:51.910 --> 36:52.790]  Daddy wins.
[36:53.570 --> 36:55.610]  Congratulations, we have 25,000 followers.
[36:55.950 --> 36:56.350]  Is that good?
[36:56.710 --> 36:59.150]  Seems like too many.
[36:59.170 --> 37:00.010]  Seems undeserved.
[37:00.870 --> 37:03.190]  Yeah, for one day a week, it seems pretty undeserved.
[37:05.430 --> 37:06.330]  I'll take it, though.
[37:06.490 --> 37:08.410]  Andrew, it's time to enact our plan.
[37:08.650 --> 37:09.210]  Let's get Gavin.
[37:09.430 --> 37:11.510]  Oh, I've been waiting for this.
[37:12.170 --> 37:14.710]  I'm going to craft the smartest stuff.
[37:15.410 --> 37:16.170]  You better watch out.
[37:16.810 --> 37:19.050]  Yeah, but the dumbest guy is going to use it, so it's fine.
[37:19.810 --> 37:20.250]  Oh!
[37:21.670 --> 37:22.590]  It evens out.
[37:25.130 --> 37:27.010]  I'm going to craft the smartest stuff.
[37:28.730 --> 37:31.530]  That would be me, and I'd show up with, like, a Lego figurine.
[37:31.550 --> 37:32.710]  Like, just six pieces.
[37:33.030 --> 37:33.750]  I made a tower.
[37:35.130 --> 37:35.890]  Look at this.
[37:40.880 --> 37:42.660]  Leave March alone. That's March.
[37:43.020 --> 37:44.640]  We need people to know that Mario Party
[37:44.640 --> 37:46.440]  March is starting
[37:46.440 --> 37:46.920]  tomorrow.
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.260]  Over on Patreon.
[37:49.420 --> 37:51.380]  I thought I had a melee weapon, but I don't.
[37:51.520 --> 37:53.900]  Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[37:54.000 --> 37:54.760]  For how much?
[37:55.420 --> 37:57.420]  It's zero dollars? It's free?
[37:58.240 --> 37:59.960]  It's free with a free account?
[38:00.280 --> 38:01.320]  I got blasted.
[38:01.820 --> 38:02.460]  I blasted him.
[38:03.020 --> 38:04.840]  Mario and March together?
[38:05.040 --> 38:07.680]  Oh, you can't see it. I was inside the... yeah, I'm in there.
[38:09.960 --> 38:11.300]  I mean, no. Maybe.
[38:11.860 --> 38:12.880]  You don't know.
[38:13.440 --> 38:15.340]  Where's baseball bat? Oh, we don't have any.
[38:15.340 --> 38:17.020]  Can you make one? No. Sweet.
[38:18.000 --> 38:18.580]  Sweet.
[38:19.640 --> 38:21.900]  Great. Cool. Whatever.
[38:23.340 --> 38:25.200]  Oh, do you start with one of these?
[38:26.060 --> 38:28.440]  What? Holy cock hole.
[38:28.900 --> 38:29.380]  A sheep?
[38:30.580 --> 38:31.800]  What are you going to do with it?
[38:33.920 --> 38:36.540]  What was your plan?
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.620]  It's a super sheep, sir!
[38:38.720 --> 38:40.000]  Oh my god!
[38:40.200 --> 38:41.580]  Holy shit!
[38:42.380 --> 38:44.100]  How did you have a super sheep?
[38:44.100 --> 38:47.160]  I made it. Maybe we start with one?
[38:47.520 --> 38:48.620]  Uh-uh. We definitely don't.
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.640]  Don't hit Mario and March. Come on!
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.840]  I've never seen a super sheep.
[38:56.340 --> 38:57.420]  That's pretty super.
[38:57.920 --> 38:58.940]  That was pretty super.
[38:58.960 --> 39:00.660]  It just wouldn't turn in the last minute.
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.380]  It went straight into myself.
[39:03.440 --> 39:04.820]  Probably shouldn't have done that one.
[39:05.440 --> 39:07.380]  Well, I still did a lot of damage to Eric.
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.380]  Yeah, that sucked.
[39:10.300 --> 39:11.700]  I liked it.
[39:13.040 --> 39:14.580]  That's not part of our plan, Andrew.
[39:14.740 --> 39:15.760]  Oh shit, you're right. I forgot.
[39:15.880 --> 39:16.900]  I already forgot we had a plan.
[39:20.060 --> 39:20.860]  Step one.
[39:25.900 --> 39:27.040]  How do I use the sheep?
[39:27.080 --> 39:27.880]  I guess we're going to find out.
[39:28.240 --> 39:30.100]  Push X and then you push X again to detonate.
[39:31.660 --> 39:32.060]  What are you doing?
[39:32.600 --> 39:33.200]  What are you doing?
[39:34.180 --> 39:35.420]  What are you doing?
[39:36.280 --> 39:38.160]  He's doing classic plan one stuff.
[39:38.800 --> 39:39.260]  Oh damn.
[39:40.820 --> 39:41.540]  Step one.
[39:42.440 --> 39:44.960]  Why didn't the mine explode?
[39:45.120 --> 39:46.140]  It's a vehicle mine.
[39:46.940 --> 39:48.580]  I just had a sheep sheep his vehicle.
[39:50.140 --> 39:51.520]  You can ride a sheep.
[39:52.540 --> 39:54.180]  You can ride a sheep.
[39:54.800 --> 39:55.560]  Have you?
[39:57.100 --> 39:58.540]  I've seen it.
[39:59.880 --> 40:00.840]  Oh, the girder play.
[40:01.660 --> 40:02.800]  The girder play.
[40:04.620 --> 40:06.760]  It's his move, man. It's what he knows.
[40:09.680 --> 40:12.940]  Could you, in real life, could you get a girder today if you wanted one?
[40:14.080 --> 40:15.020]  A steel girder?
[40:15.200 --> 40:17.340]  Yeah, if I was like, Eric, get me a girder for tonight.
[40:17.480 --> 40:17.980]  You mean like Amazon?
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.740]  Yeah, I bet you could go to a construction site and pay a guy.
[40:23.000 --> 40:23.320]  Cash?
[40:23.420 --> 40:24.800]  He's got cash. Cash is king, baby.
[40:24.940 --> 40:25.580]  Cash still rules.
[40:25.860 --> 40:28.540]  Is there a girder store you could go to and just pick up some girders?
[40:29.320 --> 40:30.260]  Yeah, Harbor Freight.
[40:33.240 --> 40:34.460]  Specifically the harbor part.
[40:34.800 --> 40:36.280]  How much do you think a girder would cost?
[40:36.360 --> 40:36.740]  A single girder?
[40:36.740 --> 40:37.320]  A regular girder.
[40:37.920 --> 40:39.200]  Oh, it's gotta be thousands.
[40:39.620 --> 40:40.080]  800 bucks?
[40:40.620 --> 40:42.080]  No, it's gotta be thousands.
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.940]  I would guess 20,000.
[40:49.920 --> 40:50.320]  Hillopolis,
[40:51.360 --> 40:51.760]  Hillopolis,
[40:52.380 --> 40:52.400]  Sage,
[40:52.680 --> 40:53.520]  this is for you.
[40:55.360 --> 40:56.580]  Thank you for five gifted.
[40:56.880 --> 40:57.280]  Boring.
[41:00.900 --> 41:03.740]  Okay, that was, sorry, you got assigned a bad turn.
[41:04.860 --> 41:05.520]  What are you talking about?
[41:05.560 --> 41:06.020]  That was a good turn.
[41:06.020 --> 41:08.560]  It's gonna pay off as soon as a
[41:09.220 --> 41:09.660]  move.
[41:11.440 --> 41:11.880]  It?
[41:16.700 --> 41:17.560]  Oh, no.
[41:18.280 --> 41:19.040]  Oh, no.
[41:19.080 --> 41:19.500]  What's happening?
[41:21.000 --> 41:21.880]  Oh, no.
[41:23.080 --> 41:23.960]  Oh, no!
[41:25.660 --> 41:26.800]  This wasn't part of the plan.
[41:28.240 --> 41:29.520]  It didn't go both ways.
[41:29.640 --> 41:32.600]  I thought it was going to.
[41:33.260 --> 41:35.020]  I really thought that was really good.
[41:35.640 --> 41:37.620]  It had so much potential to be something.
[41:37.620 --> 41:38.140]  Yeah.
[41:42.640 --> 41:44.580]  Anywhere from $100 to $400
[41:44.580 --> 41:46.580]  per foot of girder.
[41:49.260 --> 41:50.640]  The person who wrote that
[41:50.640 --> 41:52.600]  spelt girder wrong, though, so I'm not sure I trust it.
[41:52.860 --> 41:53.120]  No!
[41:53.920 --> 41:57.000]  Oh, that's almost drownable.
[41:57.360 --> 41:57.700]  No!
[41:58.100 --> 41:59.440]  1%!
[41:59.560 --> 42:01.460]  Come on!
[42:01.900 --> 42:03.920]  Condo snacks with one health with a
[42:03.920 --> 42:05.660]  freaking vehicle mine on his head.
[42:06.220 --> 42:07.540]  We hate condo snacks.
[42:07.540 --> 42:08.980]  We hate condo snacks.
[42:09.100 --> 42:10.860]  I never liked them.
[42:14.660 --> 42:15.260]  Fuck.
[42:20.840 --> 42:21.640]  What's up?
[42:22.700 --> 42:25.340]  I want to go over here, but there's a mine, right?
[42:25.640 --> 42:25.900]  Yep.
[42:26.820 --> 42:29.100]  Why did you do that?
[42:29.740 --> 42:31.460]  I'm just clearing my way.
[42:32.780 --> 42:33.700]  There you go.
[42:34.980 --> 42:35.420]  What?
[42:35.720 --> 42:36.980]  A lot of rocks.
[42:38.380 --> 42:38.820]  Fuck.
[42:41.320 --> 42:42.720]  There's no moves you can do.
[42:42.840 --> 42:44.000]  Might as well just murder again.
[42:44.220 --> 42:44.600]  Girder time!
[42:45.860 --> 42:48.440]  Are you just building a little box to live in?
[42:49.420 --> 42:50.320]  It won't let you.
[42:51.220 --> 42:51.700]  There you go.
[42:53.020 --> 42:54.100]  Maybe he's doing art.
[42:54.180 --> 42:54.940]  He's going to write something.
[42:55.460 --> 42:58.360]  He's going to write Mario Party March.
[42:58.360 --> 43:00.080]  He's got the first two thirds of an F.
[43:00.680 --> 43:01.400]  Working on it!
[43:04.940 --> 43:06.700]  It's part of my fee for Patreon.
[43:06.880 --> 43:07.860]  Just give me a few turns.
[43:08.460 --> 43:16.080]  Oh, is it Nick's turn?
[43:16.440 --> 43:18.920]  I think...
[43:19.580 --> 43:20.700]  Is my thing ready yet?
[43:20.840 --> 43:21.720]  Or is it still crafting?
[43:22.180 --> 43:23.400]  Oh, it's ready.
[43:24.200 --> 43:25.640]  I think this will be fun.
[43:27.100 --> 43:27.540]  What?
[43:29.260 --> 43:30.540]  I'm going to drop...
[43:31.460 --> 43:32.920]  I'm going to drop this.
[43:33.440 --> 43:34.320]  Let's see what happens.
[43:36.020 --> 43:37.640]  I'm not playing Patreon!
[43:38.580 --> 43:39.660]  Holy shit!
[43:40.500 --> 43:42.880]  That has to take out everyone here, right?
[43:43.160 --> 43:43.760]  You killed Cundersnacks!
[43:44.140 --> 43:45.980]  Yeah, Cundersnacks is toast, dude.
[43:46.920 --> 43:48.420]  Damn, what the hell was that?
[43:49.880 --> 43:51.280]  370 kill damage?
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.260]  Are you kidding me?
[43:52.700 --> 43:54.200]  That, I believe, was a concrete...
[43:54.200 --> 43:56.500]  A concrete angry donkey.
[43:56.880 --> 43:58.140]  Angry concrete donkey, yeah.
[43:58.340 --> 44:00.640]  That was the move of worms, dude.
[44:00.700 --> 44:02.300]  You took out everyone.
[44:02.820 --> 44:04.440]  Where did that come from?
[44:04.880 --> 44:06.920]  I think that's the most powerful thing in the game.
[44:07.840 --> 44:08.240]  Wow!
[44:08.540 --> 44:09.460]  Can we just make it?
[44:10.500 --> 44:13.040]  I had to dismantle some shit to make it, but yeah, I made it.
[44:14.100 --> 44:14.900]  That's crazy.
[44:15.740 --> 44:17.440]  I'm going to dismantle so much stuff.
[44:17.520 --> 44:18.900]  I'm going to make something so good.
[44:19.840 --> 44:21.940]  He's going to make the smartest stuff, dude.
[44:28.840 --> 44:29.660]  So, what's the plan?
[44:32.140 --> 44:33.920]  Oh, it's my turn. Oh, idiot.
[44:34.240 --> 44:35.940]  You're building something so smart. You're in the lab.
[44:35.940 --> 44:38.320]  You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[44:38.440 --> 44:39.200]  He's in the lab.
[44:42.240 --> 44:45.820]  Oh my god, you got so lucky.
[44:46.500 --> 44:47.660]  You got so lucky.
[44:48.180 --> 44:49.000]  There you go.
[44:49.880 --> 44:51.700]  That's why I was going around.
[44:52.220 --> 44:53.980]  Oh my god, get him with the other one.
[44:54.300 --> 44:54.820]  Yes!
[44:56.200 --> 44:58.340]  I told you it was a good turn, Eric.
[44:58.580 --> 44:59.900]  You just had to wait for it.
[45:00.020 --> 45:02.580]  That was a great turn.
[45:03.080 --> 45:04.960]  Okay, I need to lie down.
[45:07.560 --> 45:08.740]  That turn was awesome.
[45:09.580 --> 45:11.320]  To be fair, I made it further across the map
[45:11.320 --> 45:12.940]  than I would have with that jetpack alone.
[45:12.960 --> 45:13.380]  That's true.
[45:13.940 --> 45:15.100]  And with a lot less health.
[45:17.440 --> 45:18.320]  Oh, Christ.
[45:20.080 --> 45:21.640]  Oh, grundle milk sucks.
[45:34.040 --> 45:36.060]  I love this fucking game, man.
[45:37.560 --> 45:39.300]  It just keeps getting better.
[45:40.980 --> 45:42.580]  I thought I had enough distance
[45:42.580 --> 45:43.760]  where it wasn't going to get me.
[45:43.760 --> 45:45.460]  I really didn't think I was that close.
[45:48.480 --> 45:49.900]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[45:58.720 --> 45:59.520]  I'm scared.
[46:01.420 --> 46:02.580]  Oh my god.
[46:05.340 --> 46:06.380]  I'm real scared.
[46:06.380 --> 46:09.900]  I can't move any of my worms.
[46:11.580 --> 46:14.860]  Alright, Nick.
[46:15.500 --> 46:16.920]  Oh, you know what?
[46:17.700 --> 46:18.000]  What's that?
[46:20.360 --> 46:21.260]  Can I?
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.100]  Can she? Will she?
[46:23.280 --> 46:23.720]  No.
[46:24.620 --> 46:25.600]  Would he? No.
[46:26.420 --> 46:27.120]  Let's try this.
[46:27.580 --> 46:28.860]  Geoff has lost like no health.
[46:29.600 --> 46:30.920]  Oh my god.
[46:32.300 --> 46:34.060]  What are you, Gavin?
[46:35.900 --> 46:37.000]  We gotta kill
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.200]  the donkey that's down there.
[46:38.240 --> 46:39.200]  You throw that down there.
[46:41.600 --> 46:42.580]  That'll teach him.
[46:43.540 --> 46:44.940]  You gotta follow up the move
[46:44.940 --> 46:46.900]  of the day with the other kind of move
[46:46.900 --> 46:47.280]  of the day.
[46:47.740 --> 46:51.000]  I can't even go up there
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.460]  because there's a freaking turret.
[46:53.340 --> 46:54.000]  Alright, what am I doing?
[46:54.100 --> 46:54.560]  What am I gonna do?
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.480]  It's tough, right?
[46:58.120 --> 46:59.840]  It's pretty damn tough.
[47:01.200 --> 47:02.760]  Might be one for old
[47:02.760 --> 47:03.520]  sheepson.
[47:08.030 --> 47:08.870]  Alright, sheepson.
[47:09.550 --> 47:10.890]  Okay. Nope. Yep.
[47:11.170 --> 47:12.990]  Now, are you controlling the...
[47:12.990 --> 47:14.390]  Are you controlling the sheep at this point
[47:14.390 --> 47:15.470]  or is he doing that on his own?
[47:15.710 --> 47:16.450]  I'm doing this.
[47:19.690 --> 47:20.770]  Nice! That's great.
[47:21.050 --> 47:22.230]  Maybe a bit further away from me.
[47:22.790 --> 47:24.830]  Yeah, I mean it should be really far from you
[47:24.830 --> 47:26.590]  but you have no time and you're gonna blow it.
[47:27.810 --> 47:29.390]  Wow, you got lucky.
[47:29.970 --> 47:30.810]  But don't worry.
[47:30.910 --> 47:32.450]  I'm sure that tank is gonna explode
[47:32.450 --> 47:33.430]  so you should be okay.
[47:34.870 --> 47:35.990]  Seems like it.
[47:36.810 --> 47:37.630]  Pretty mid-sheep.
[47:37.650 --> 47:38.890]  Oh, he didn't do it. Damn.
[47:40.550 --> 47:41.710]  Not my best sheeping.
[47:47.650 --> 47:48.170]  No!
[47:49.990 --> 47:51.310]  Straight through his girders!
[47:56.140 --> 47:56.660]  That...
[47:56.660 --> 47:58.160]  was amazing.
[47:59.040 --> 48:00.820]  Straight through his girder fort.
[48:01.060 --> 48:03.160]  What was the point of having a thick one
[48:03.160 --> 48:04.520]  if it just goes straight through?
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.940]  It's just more material, isn't it?
[48:07.300 --> 48:08.360]  What's the point?
[48:11.580 --> 48:12.920]  I'm high-flying, baby!
[48:14.300 --> 48:15.460]  I need some worm tears.
[48:15.520 --> 48:15.620]  Look at him go!
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.880]  Getting into the command post.
[48:22.980 --> 48:23.860]  You're gonna have such a nasty spill.
[48:23.860 --> 48:24.980]  Make it rain on you fucks!
[48:26.020 --> 48:26.540]  Okay.
[48:27.680 --> 48:29.420]  You got it. Show him, Andrew.
[48:30.160 --> 48:31.380]  No! Okay.
[48:31.380 --> 48:31.600]  No!
[48:34.260 --> 48:35.220]  You moron.
[48:37.060 --> 48:38.860]  You hurt yourself.
[48:39.580 --> 48:41.400]  You're so lucky it didn't fall.
[48:42.020 --> 48:43.300]  That is so funny.
[48:46.180 --> 48:46.980]  Uh, okay.
[48:47.100 --> 48:49.700]  Well, this'll be fun. I know exactly what I wanna do now.
[48:52.520 --> 48:52.800]  No!
[48:53.700 --> 48:55.320]  Dude, I was doing the same thing
[48:55.320 --> 48:56.000]  if you weren't.
[48:56.580 --> 48:57.880]  Is the plane even high enough?
[48:57.880 --> 48:58.660]  Oh, wow!
[49:07.700 --> 49:10.220]  This turret is the MVP of this game.
[49:11.600 --> 49:13.140]  Oh, it's so good!
[49:17.640 --> 49:19.300]  Why didn't you go up there?
[49:20.280 --> 49:22.420]  They make it very easy to do that.
[49:22.740 --> 49:23.940]  It's so funny.
[49:24.900 --> 49:25.560]  I don't like it.
[49:28.400 --> 49:29.620]  You missed!
[49:29.960 --> 49:30.500]  You missed!
[49:31.800 --> 49:32.600]  Okay.
[49:33.460 --> 49:33.860]  Ooh.
[49:35.480 --> 49:36.280]  Okay.
[49:37.860 --> 49:39.080]  Are you feeling good?
[49:39.540 --> 49:39.700]  Yeah.
[49:44.400 --> 49:45.980]  No! Oh, wow!
[49:46.280 --> 49:46.560]  No!
[49:47.660 --> 49:49.600]  What a dash!
[49:50.300 --> 49:51.100]  Wow!
[49:52.140 --> 49:54.540]  Dude, you took everyone out.
[49:54.740 --> 49:54.780]  Awesome!
[49:55.040 --> 49:56.720]  Harry, hold on!
[49:57.460 --> 49:58.620]  Oh, my God!
[49:58.760 --> 49:59.420]  March, no!
[50:00.180 --> 50:02.660]  But that's the month where we're playing Mario Party
[50:02.660 --> 50:03.640]  all month long! No!
[50:04.600 --> 50:06.960]  That was such a great spot to throw a banana from.
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.880]  Tank, don't blow up! Harry's got 1%!
[50:09.180 --> 50:10.100]  Hold on, Harry!
[50:12.300 --> 50:12.740]  Wow!
[50:16.180 --> 50:17.780]  How did that feel to pull off?
[50:18.580 --> 50:20.980]  Real good after dumping those holy hand grenades earlier.
[50:26.540 --> 50:27.020]  Wow.
[50:27.160 --> 50:28.860]  Some sort of airstrike?
[50:30.000 --> 50:31.360]  Some sort of airstrike.
[50:31.460 --> 50:31.940]  Oh, shit.
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.800]  Who knows where it can go?
[50:33.980 --> 50:34.380]  Oh, no!
[50:40.460 --> 50:42.060]  Did someone say airstrike?
[50:51.250 --> 50:53.790]  A little sneak peek of BungleFud up there.
[50:57.270 --> 50:58.230]  Oh, come on, Mario.
[50:58.330 --> 50:58.970]  You got this.
[50:59.730 --> 51:01.570]  Mario just gets littered with equipment.
[51:02.250 --> 51:03.190]  Well, he needs it.
[51:03.770 --> 51:05.190]  He needs all the help he can get.
[51:05.950 --> 51:07.010]  Let's take this.
[51:08.590 --> 51:10.090]  Man, what am I...
[51:10.090 --> 51:10.530]  Damn it.
[51:11.250 --> 51:13.050]  I was hoping you would leave that for DermalGunk.
[51:13.450 --> 51:14.330]  No, I gotta take it.
[51:15.090 --> 51:15.910]  Sorry, Dermal.
[51:18.310 --> 51:20.010]  But I don't like this airstrike thing.
[51:20.130 --> 51:20.850]  Oh, okay.
[51:20.850 --> 51:22.470]  Alright, so we're gonna...
[51:22.470 --> 51:24.010]  I didn't know you were, I got you.
[51:25.250 --> 51:25.890]  You're all good.
[51:27.330 --> 51:28.290]  Don't worry about it.
[51:29.870 --> 51:30.590]  Thanks, man.
[51:31.350 --> 51:31.850]  There you go.
[51:32.930 --> 51:33.990]  Here you go.
[51:34.290 --> 51:34.770]  All good.
[51:35.650 --> 51:36.050]  No!
[51:38.530 --> 51:39.410]  Oh, where's that going?
[51:41.270 --> 51:42.070]  On Dermal!
[51:44.510 --> 51:46.370]  Why did it snap the camera away?
[51:46.430 --> 51:46.930]  What happened?
[51:46.930 --> 51:47.970]  I don't know.
[51:48.270 --> 51:50.070]  It keeps going to BungleFud for me.
[51:50.410 --> 51:52.970]  Yeah, why is it sucking the camera over to BungleFud?
[51:53.570 --> 51:54.270]  Why? Why?
[51:54.350 --> 51:55.430]  Why are you saying it about him?
[51:56.490 --> 51:57.850]  Is it just because the girder went there?
[51:58.310 --> 51:59.110]  I think so.
[51:59.630 --> 51:59.710]  Okay.
[52:03.550 --> 52:03.990]  Uh...
[52:03.990 --> 52:04.910]  Let's see.
[52:06.450 --> 52:08.670]  It might be time to take some defensive measures.
[52:09.330 --> 52:09.790]  Is that right?
[52:10.230 --> 52:11.710]  Yeah, I think so.
[52:12.790 --> 52:13.950]  Yep, that's smart.
[52:18.490 --> 52:20.490]  Oh, and it's got like an anti-flooding loop there.
[52:20.550 --> 52:21.050]  That's great.
[52:21.650 --> 52:25.530]  The water will collect there in what I call the reflecting pool.
[52:29.790 --> 52:30.910]  Grundle Milk.
[52:32.750 --> 52:34.590]  Alright, let's go shopping, Grundle.
[52:38.650 --> 52:38.950]  Okay.
[52:43.270 --> 52:44.130]  Oh, wow.
[52:45.510 --> 52:47.970]  Yeah, there's all the crafting shit on the right.
[52:48.110 --> 52:48.470]  Fuck.
[52:49.390 --> 52:49.830]  Ouch.
[52:49.930 --> 52:51.030]  Oh, he's going to get loaded up.
[52:51.750 --> 52:52.190]  Dude.
[52:52.390 --> 52:54.230]  Can you see?
[52:54.770 --> 52:56.470]  No, I can't see inside there.
[52:58.050 --> 52:59.130]  Don't worry about it.
[52:59.810 --> 53:02.950]  He's going over to the left to get the health.
[53:03.070 --> 53:03.510]  He's getting the health.
[53:04.630 --> 53:06.230]  Now he's jumping over.
[53:06.330 --> 53:07.230]  He's got to jump over.
[53:08.250 --> 53:10.070]  He's going to try to blow me up.
[53:10.210 --> 53:12.210]  There's a vehicle mine here.
[53:12.750 --> 53:13.930]  Oh, shit.
[53:14.350 --> 53:16.110]  I mean, he's out of time.
[53:16.110 --> 53:17.730]  He's throwing a...
[53:17.730 --> 53:17.970]  Okay.
[53:20.330 --> 53:21.290]  Watch this.
[53:21.650 --> 53:22.610]  There you go.
[53:23.430 --> 53:25.190]  Hey, I can see in now.
[53:25.750 --> 53:27.230]  Oh, that's what it looks like in there.
[53:27.270 --> 53:27.710]  That's pretty cool.
[53:28.130 --> 53:30.410]  I'm never using a holy hand grenade again.
[53:32.030 --> 53:33.170]  That's so heavy.
[53:37.910 --> 53:38.670]  Let's see.
[53:44.480 --> 53:45.700]  Oh, that could be a problem.
[53:46.180 --> 53:46.660]  Oh, dear.
[53:46.920 --> 53:47.940]  That could be a real problem.
[53:48.320 --> 53:48.980]  Oh, no.
[53:48.980 --> 53:50.140]  Oh, no.
[53:50.440 --> 53:52.060]  He just put him over here?
[53:52.480 --> 53:54.200]  That's not what I wanted.
[53:54.740 --> 53:56.040]  Mario, no.
[53:58.540 --> 54:00.560]  Oh, God. Now he's going to get supplies also?
[54:02.700 --> 54:03.480]  Oh, my God.
[54:05.420 --> 54:06.600]  Supplies would be cool.
[54:10.450 --> 54:10.750]  What?
[54:12.330 --> 54:14.250]  Why did you hit X?
[54:14.510 --> 54:15.690]  What did you do?
[54:15.690 --> 54:17.510]  I'm through with that.
[54:17.610 --> 54:18.970]  Your head.
[54:19.030 --> 54:20.470]  No, Harry.
[54:23.570 --> 54:24.170]  Fuck.
[54:24.890 --> 54:26.470]  You only had one health anyway.
[54:26.650 --> 54:28.030]  You're already done for.
[54:30.790 --> 54:31.990]  I had...
[54:34.810 --> 54:37.490]  Yeah, everyone's waving the idiot flag for you there, bud.
[54:40.390 --> 54:41.550]  Oh, Harry.
[54:47.610 --> 54:48.450]  Yeah, right?
[54:48.530 --> 54:49.130]  I want this.
[54:49.530 --> 54:50.190]  Oh, dear.
[54:53.850 --> 54:54.890]  Oh, shit.
[54:56.170 --> 54:57.150]  That's going to be bad.
[54:58.490 --> 54:59.570]  Oh, my God.
[54:59.870 --> 55:01.150]  I think I got away with that.
[55:02.950 --> 55:04.250]  Could have been worse.
[55:04.630 --> 55:04.850]  Yep.
[55:08.230 --> 55:10.310]  That's probably a room full of shit there.
[55:12.490 --> 55:13.430]  Where's my worm?
[55:14.990 --> 55:15.710]  Dermal gunk time.
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.940]  Eep, eep, eep, eep.
[55:23.180 --> 55:24.160]  What the fuck?
[55:24.680 --> 55:24.780]  What?
[55:24.960 --> 55:26.220]  It's the noise it was making.
[55:27.920 --> 55:28.360]  No!
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.220]  You stupid idiot.
[55:36.060 --> 55:36.820]  Hit the button.
[55:36.980 --> 55:37.580]  What are you doing?
[55:37.780 --> 55:40.620]  I protected you. I put a girder over your head.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.480]  This isn't for you.
[55:42.620 --> 55:44.320]  But I'm here.
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.760]  What do you mean it's not for me?
[55:45.760 --> 55:47.120]  It couldn't be more for me.
[55:47.120 --> 55:48.460]  You think that's foul play?
[55:48.720 --> 55:49.200]  No.
[55:49.660 --> 55:51.820]  Are you going to set it or not?
[55:53.740 --> 55:54.860]  You suck.
[55:55.560 --> 55:57.340]  That's so much worse.
[55:59.020 --> 56:01.200]  That is so much worse.
[56:01.600 --> 56:03.120]  That is so much worse.
[56:03.520 --> 56:04.920]  That's insane.
[56:05.360 --> 56:06.300]  What a dick move.
[56:06.760 --> 56:08.400]  That was unfortunate.
[56:08.560 --> 56:11.340]  I got the time limit, and I really got my thumbs in a knot,
[56:11.520 --> 56:12.680]  and it ended up worse.
[56:13.860 --> 56:14.660]  Geez, man.
[56:15.260 --> 56:16.540]  Andrew, don't move that guy.
[56:16.700 --> 56:18.080]  I'll put a girder between you and it.
[56:19.380 --> 56:21.100]  I don't think I can get down there.
[56:21.980 --> 56:22.820]  Try a backflip.
[56:23.300 --> 56:25.740]  There's so much stuff in that house.
[56:28.100 --> 56:28.700]  Let's see.
[56:29.140 --> 56:30.560]  Why don't you just go in the little side bit?
[56:31.080 --> 56:32.380]  What's up, Pigeon Studios? Thanks for the sub.
[56:36.900 --> 56:38.740]  I think if I do this...
[56:38.740 --> 56:38.860]  Yeah.
[56:39.380 --> 56:40.300]  I would like to...
[56:40.300 --> 56:42.720]  Will it hit the vehicle?
[56:42.720 --> 56:45.040]  Oh my God, it hit me.
[56:45.280 --> 56:47.120]  How did he get the one over there again?
[56:47.220 --> 56:48.300]  That's back where he was.
[56:49.720 --> 56:50.880]  That's insane.
[56:51.660 --> 56:53.740]  What is going on?
[56:53.920 --> 56:55.300]  How did you do that?
[56:55.440 --> 56:56.280]  That was crazy.
[56:56.640 --> 56:58.300]  How did you do that?
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.760]  I don't know.
[57:00.160 --> 57:01.620]  That was like dark magic.
[57:02.260 --> 57:03.120]  That was insane.
[57:04.340 --> 57:06.560]  r slash black magic fuckery.
[57:06.680 --> 57:07.840]  Check us out, God.
[57:08.180 --> 57:09.880]  That's like...
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.880]  What was that idea you had earlier? Television time travel?
[57:13.400 --> 57:13.780]  Oh, yeah.
[57:13.900 --> 57:15.840]  I teleported back to the past.
[57:15.860 --> 57:16.960]  That was crazy.
[57:18.320 --> 57:18.520]  Alright.
[57:19.340 --> 57:20.120]  Whose turn is it?
[57:20.540 --> 57:21.140]  My turn.
[57:21.800 --> 57:22.880]  Why are you looking down your gun?
[57:25.600 --> 57:26.840]  You piece of shit!
[57:27.100 --> 57:27.900]  You piece of shit!
[57:28.300 --> 57:29.100]  You piece of shit!
[57:31.160 --> 57:32.740]  You son of a bitch!
[57:33.820 --> 57:35.100]  Why did you do that?
[57:35.300 --> 57:37.400]  Why did you do that?
[57:37.400 --> 57:39.220]  Why would you do that?
[57:39.240 --> 57:41.180]  I was trying to do something and you made me panic.
[57:41.280 --> 57:43.660]  You put a turret on me and you shot me off the map.
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.480]  I put a girder above your head!
[57:50.240 --> 57:51.600]  I was going to put one for you,
[57:51.680 --> 57:52.920]  but you didn't let me do it in time.
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.180]  Put one first, then put the turret.
[57:55.520 --> 57:56.500]  Yeah, I messed up.
[57:57.320 --> 57:58.120]  I messed up.
[57:58.440 --> 57:59.560]  I need you to hang tight.
[58:02.320 --> 58:03.300]  This looks good.
[58:03.700 --> 58:04.640]  This is awful.
[58:05.260 --> 58:05.740]  Oh!
[58:07.040 --> 58:08.700]  I thought you were going to thread the needle.
[58:10.640 --> 58:13.260]  At least shoot me down with a gun or a rocket.
[58:15.140 --> 58:17.040]  There is gun and rocket components
[58:17.040 --> 58:17.560]  in that bomb.
[58:18.060 --> 58:18.920]  That's true, I saw it.
[58:20.500 --> 58:22.780]  You can enact your immediate revenge
[58:22.780 --> 58:24.680]  on Mario over there.
[58:26.880 --> 58:27.740]  There's the climb.
[58:27.980 --> 58:28.800]  It's the climb!
[58:30.480 --> 58:31.180]  There you go.
[58:31.180 --> 58:32.340]  There you go.
[58:32.800 --> 58:33.940]  There you go.
[58:33.980 --> 58:35.880]  Geoff has four worms and I'm out.
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.080]  All the way up.
[58:38.880 --> 58:39.280]  There you go.
[58:39.800 --> 58:41.880]  One worm has four worms.
[58:42.620 --> 58:43.940]  There you go.
[58:44.740 --> 58:45.880]  Nobody knows.
[58:46.200 --> 58:48.480]  Nobody cares about Geoff's worms.
[58:48.980 --> 58:49.380]  You got time.
[58:50.280 --> 58:50.860]  That's fucked.
[58:51.120 --> 58:53.240]  He's going to get all these craft shit.
[58:55.540 --> 58:56.560]  It's too dangerous.
[58:57.280 --> 58:58.720]  There's a turret on top of it.
[58:59.740 --> 59:00.360]  He's...
[59:00.360 --> 59:01.220]  Well, maybe.
[59:04.450 --> 59:05.080]  I'm stuck.
[59:08.470 --> 59:09.400]  Good turn.
[59:10.640 --> 59:11.480]  That might pay off later.
[59:12.360 --> 59:12.540]  Yeah.
[59:14.780 --> 59:16.840]  I can't believe Andrew's out.
[59:18.940 --> 59:20.780]  You did it! What do you mean you did it?
[59:22.100 --> 59:22.720]  Well...
[59:22.720 --> 59:23.700]  You didn't wait.
[59:25.860 --> 59:27.300]  You moved it so much worse.
[59:27.860 --> 59:28.900]  You didn't wait.
[59:29.360 --> 59:30.780]  Yeah, why didn't you wait?
[59:30.860 --> 59:31.900]  I can't believe you did that.
[59:31.900 --> 59:32.920]  Do you remember when Gavin said, wait!
[59:33.560 --> 59:35.720]  I remember when he was like, why you got a gun out?
[59:35.760 --> 59:36.560]  And I was like, wait, what?
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.080]  And then I moved slightly in.
[59:39.680 --> 59:41.140]  It's going to hit the vehicle again.
[59:42.680 --> 59:43.080]  Nope.
[59:43.860 --> 59:44.860]  No, it fucked me up.
[59:45.440 --> 59:45.860]  There you go.
[59:46.560 --> 59:47.900]  I want that specific worm dead.
[59:48.860 --> 59:49.260]  Nick?
[59:49.260 --> 59:49.380]  Nick?
[59:50.880 --> 59:51.880]  Thank you, Pete.
[59:52.200 --> 59:53.980]  This turn's for you.
[59:54.060 --> 59:55.320]  I'm excited about this turn.
[59:55.780 --> 59:56.340]  Why?
[01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:01.910]  Dragon punch?
[01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.430]  No!
[01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.090]  Leave Mario alone!
[01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:09.370]  That really hurt.
[01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:09.970]  Yeah.
[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:10.530]  That was crazy.
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.520]  Sometimes you got to get fisty with it.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.480]  I hear that.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.760]  Y'all ain't got any banana bomb seeds on you, do ya?
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.320]  Tons.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.640]  No, I need some too if you guys are...
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.880]  Dive into the sea, motherfucker.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060]  I got eight. Go ahead.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.080]  I'm loaded with them.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.780]  No, he's having a party. Stop.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:41.980]  Cop it, buddy.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.420]  Cop it, buddy.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.200]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.380]  Oh, man.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.400]  Well, that's the end of Nick.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.080]  Yep.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.240]  Bye, Nick.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.080]  Oh, almost got the other Nick, too.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:54.940]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.780]  36. That's good.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.120]  I think that's gonna blow up, isn't it?
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:00.840]  No? All right, cool.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.180]  I don't think I can chance it.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.080]  I can.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.900]  You going in?
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.380]  I was. I think I'm out of blowtorch.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.640]  I don't think I have the blowtorch.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.700]  You can't just walk in now?
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.000]  There's nowhere to walk in
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.020]  where I'm gonna be able to, like, not get
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.020]  fucking annihilated.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.520]  That's 5-0-1. Almost.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.280]  Oh, it's right on the...
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.820]  5-0-1 banana.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:34.540]  No!
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.360]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.540]  Oh, God, no!
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:40.780]  That was so good.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.860]  Nick died. Boom, baby.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.820]  Ah, fucking... Nick.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:46.920]  No.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.380]  There he is.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.320]  Preston, Nick.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:53.580]  Hell
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.300]  yeah!
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.120]  I'm gonna
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.180]  use what may be my last turn
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.140]  to try something.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:06.580]  I don't know what this thing is.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.960]  5-0-1, baby!
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.200]  5-0-1 is the best time of the week!
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.300]  What is this device?
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.040]  Is that a drone?
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.280]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.580]  I don't know what it does, though.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.660]  I think you have to hit X, don't you?
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.240]  I did hit X.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.060]  Yeah, you shouldn't have done that, I don't think.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.560]  Best time of the week
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.180]  with the best move of the week. Way to go, boys.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.320]  Oh, God. I knew it was gonna fuck me.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.460]  Audience, okay.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.380]  What's a fucking mischievous drone do?
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:35.940]  We've never seen
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.720]  what it actually does.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.780]  Also, the chat
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.100]  has voted it was Andrew's fault.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:42.920]  The turret.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.680]  I'm glad we voted on that.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.060]  Whose turn is it?
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.260]  Are you just done with your turn, or what, Geoff?
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:50.860]  Yeah.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.040]  Set the controller down? Okay, cool.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.780]  That was like half a turn.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.620]  That was only half a turn? I could've done something else.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.820]  Yeah, well.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.840]  Maybe it's to find people?
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:02.900]  I don't know.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.360]  Complete the other half of your turn.
[01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.990]  Shit. Wrong button again.
[01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:11.310]  Frickin' what?
[01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:12.150]  Doesn't that suck?
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.310]  It's fun to see every time.
[01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:19.570]  Alright, just make the jump,
[01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.510]  sheep. Jump the gap.
[01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:23.630]  Alright, here you go, sheep.
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:24.990]  You got it.
[01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.010]  I think it's got this.
[01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:28.070]  I think you got it.
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.230]  Hey, Ghostmaker, thanks for the subs. This move's for you.
[01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:32.630]  Nailed it.
[01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:34.330]  Well, there you go.
[01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:36.370]  Here you go.
[01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.870]  He's got it.
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:38.350]  All the way up.
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.010]  Here you go, sheep.
[01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.090]  Ghostmaker, that was for you.
[01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:48.230]  Sorry, Ghostmaker.
[01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:51.690]  That sheep was called Ghostmaker.
[01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:53.230]  Man, that
[01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:55.610]  restaurant or music store
[01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:57.770]  or whatever it is, has got it really
[01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.910]  hard to park at.
[01:03:59.450 --> 01:04:01.010]  Well, it's got a giant guitar on it.
[01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:04.670]  Here comes the holy.
[01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.750]  Here comes the holy.
[01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:09.810]  Run, ukulele!
[01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.870]  Hey, can we get a vote on whose fault that was?
[01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:15.930]  I think it was Andrew's, honestly.
[01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.350]  No!
[01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:19.510]  Are you trying to rival the worst holy hand grenade throw?
[01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:22.110]  I thought I gave it just enough beans.
[01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.970]  It wasn't enough beans.
[01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:24.310]  You gave it one bean.
[01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:27.270]  Nah, I gave it a little bit more than one bean. I gave it three or four beans.
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:29.190]  I counted at least five.
[01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:32.410]  Geoff's got crafting stuff.
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:33.870]  Game's over.
[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:40.360]  Hey, leave party alone.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.300]  Oh, lovely
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:44.820]  carpet.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.520]  Oh, god.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:50.980]  Oh, boy.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.700]  Pretty close.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.700]  Oh, he got himself!
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.240]  Absolutely perfect.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.660]  Good job, Geoff.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.100]  Oh, seven damage. Awesome.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.320]  Just like I was hoping.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.520]  Pulled it off.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:07.700]  This'll hurt me.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.260]  That probably just did a little bit more.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.360]  Double damage.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.780]  Oh, we're sinking, boys.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.000]  Oh, boy. I don't know, guys.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.540]  Okay, A is jump.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.100]  A is jump.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.000]  If only there was a structure made high up in the sky.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.360]  Here you go, A is jump.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.140]  Here you go, A is jump.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:30.620]  X.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.480]  There you go, A is jump.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:34.780]  X.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.340]  There you go, you wanna hit A?
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:36.720]  X.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.220]  There you go.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:45.140]  Oh, that's the stuff I need, son!
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:50.940]  Get out of there.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.580]  You gotta get to higher ground.
[01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:57.170]  Okay, who's about?
[01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.870]  You're going back in the hole.
[01:05:58.110 --> 01:05:58.570]  Who's about?
[01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:01.090]  Five.
[01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.610]  Four.
[01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:02.290]  Three.
[01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:03.250]  Two.
[01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:04.250]  One.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.120]  You essentially poured one out for Grim Reaper, is what you did.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:14.960]  Oh, no.
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.640]  Let's go!
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.260]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.460]  I'd like to be getting that stuff, but, you know, it is what it is.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.000]  Yeah.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:33.600]  Let's see what happens.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.000]  No!
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:36.660]  No!
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.600]  All of the girders!
[01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:51.710]  Did you know most of that would hit the girders?
[01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.790]  No, no, I didn't. That's great.
[01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:54.770]  That was pretty great.
[01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.070]  Oh, sea level rise.
[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:04.810]  Geoff's in the reflecting pool. That's not good.
[01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:07.730]  You gotta be careful.
[01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:11.830]  All right, let's do something about this.
[01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:14.190]  Dig Reaper, thanks for the five gifted subs.
[01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:18.510]  To the top, all the way up, Geoff.
[01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:21.210]  Wow, what a move.
[01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.070]  Or the music shop on the hill.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.360]  I can kind of see what's happening.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.900]  So he's inside.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.640]  He's inside right next to me, but also right next to
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.100]  an explosive barrel.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.660]  He's placed a very small mine,
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.120]  and now he is leaving.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.620]  If it worked,
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.680]  I blew up.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.160]  I have 99 health, and now I am down to
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.080]  two health.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.400]  Party is hurting.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.580]  All right, your turn, Delta P.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.100]  I gotta get some height.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.620]  I got nothing here.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:14.980]  Yeah, you got nothing.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.140]  Can I aim this in the wind?
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:19.880]  Yeah.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:20.880]  I think so, right?
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.840]  Yeah, of course.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.060]  Okay.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.400]  I mean...
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:28.940]  Clock the side there a little bit.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.340]  Way to go, bud.
[01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:40.110]  I can't believe this game is still going
[01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:41.490]  completely according to plan, Eric.
[01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:41.970]  Good planning.
[01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:45.710]  Don't know if I can airstrike that way.
[01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:47.650]  Tough. Tough.
[01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.730]  You can flip it.
[01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:51.450]  It's not gonna give me anything better
[01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:52.290]  the other way, I don't think.
[01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:53.710]  You know what, Andrew?
[01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.990]  Maybe you're right.
[01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:59.130]  Maybe you're right.
[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:02.110]  We're gonna do this.
[01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.510]  We're gonna see what happens.
[01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.930]  Does it make it? No.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:10.690]  But...
[01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:13.290]  See, so close, but just not quite there.
[01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:14.670]  Had just enough above him.
[01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:17.310]  Just didn't have anything to make something happen with it.
[01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.090]  That's the problem.
[01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.310]  Dermal gunk, you gotta leave, son.
[01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:22.990]  Dermal gunk. Dermal stuck.
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:25.730]  Shit.
[01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.810]  Alright, here comes Geoff.
[01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:33.170]  Oh, he got such a great shot.
[01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:33.550]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:36.510]  Oh, no way. You're so lucky.
[01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.710]  Ow! You're crazy.
[01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:41.450]  That was so lucky.
[01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:43.590]  Bonk my fucking head on the roof.
[01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:46.430]  It's been 13 years of doing that.
[01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.970]  I don't know how to get away from it.
[01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:50.370]  It's incredible. We're an unstoppable group.
[01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:56.590]  Oh, he's gonna get so much stuff.
[01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:57.630]  Yep.
[01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:00.270]  How do I...
[01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:01.210]  Hold Y.
[01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:01.350]  Okay.
[01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:06.730]  Repel. Nice.
[01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:08.630]  Do I want repelling?
[01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:09.410]  Yeah.
[01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:13.400]  Yeah, I just want it to be...
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.560]  Yeah, get away from it.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.560]  This is a fun one.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:21.580]  Yep.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.660]  You think it'll push back the water?
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:31.420]  Oh, boy.
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.560]  Okay, let's see.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.220]  What do we got left, boys?
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.320]  Who is that just coughing?
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.540]  Did we record a cough line?
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:40.560]  Maybe.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.580]  Don't think I want the sheep.
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:44.940]  Grenade?
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.060]  Jesus, dude.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.260]  Alright, we're gonna give it a shot.
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.160]  How strong do you think Repel is?
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.560]  Just asking.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.500]  I think we're about to find...
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.000]  Oh, God.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.720]  Mario, no!
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.860]  I'm down to one worm
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:07.680]  with two health.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:08.960]  Oh, man.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.820]  I didn't realize my turret had already been eaten by the ocean.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.620]  Not a whole hell of a lot
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.000]  for Geoff to do here
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.540]  from my position.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.840]  I mean, you could throw another airstrike
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.940]  because if mine takes out...
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.280]  Oh, the girders.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.300]  Make it, make it, make it.
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:27.960]  Oh!
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.640]  Now, I will say
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.960]  that was a very good move.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:34.860]  Nice.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.600]  Good evade, Geoff.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.580]  It was exactly where Geoff was.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.000]  It landed exactly where Geoff was
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.700]  right before his turn.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.920]  Does anyone know what the goddamn
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.520]  I should do now?
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:51.880]  Help!
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:54.400]  Help!
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.940]  This is awesome. Gotta go up.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.860]  Get me outta here!
[01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:04.330]  It's the climb.
[01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:09.590]  Oh, nice.
[01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.190]  I don't think I can get up there.
[01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:24.750]  Nope, I don't think so.
[01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:27.810]  Yeah, this is not looking
[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:28.290]  good for
[01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:31.410]  my last little guy here.
[01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:32.310]  Yikes.
[01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.570]  What do you think this does?
[01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.050]  Oh, is it like a nasty present of some sort?
[01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.710]  Yeah, it says unwanted present.
[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:42.450]  We're just gonna toss it?
[01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.810]  I mean, we're already so close, we're just gonna get
[01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:45.510]  something going here.
[01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:48.070]  I think it explodes next turn.
[01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:50.830]  Well, I guess we're gonna
[01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:51.310]  find out.
[01:12:55.190 --> 01:12:56.730]  Thermal just holdin' on.
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:57.930]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.880]  You can get Bunglefud, Geoff.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.660]  B-b-b-b-b-
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.220]  Bunglefud.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.260]  Baseball bat him into the
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.680]  sea. There you go.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.700]  I don't have a baseball bat, unfortunately.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.160]  Damn.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:20.700]  Oops.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.700]  Why don't I get up there?
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.000]  Uh...
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.480]  Maybe this'll fuck him up.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:30.260]  Okay.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.980]  You're just gonna burn me? Ow.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.740]  You got him a little hot.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.860]  You burnt my back.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.760]  Oh, the present!
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.320]  What's it gonna do?
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.280]  Oh, here we go.
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.520]  Still hasn't exploded.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.240]  Do you have a bat you can bat Geoff away?
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.440]  Nah, he doesn't.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.040]  Tough.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.500]  He's probably just gonna burn him.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:01.500]  Ooh.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.060]  I...
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.140]  There's no way that that works.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:07.600]  Yeah, it probably will.
[01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:13.190]  Are you regretting your
[01:14:13.190 --> 01:14:14.130]  rappel at this point?
[01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.870]  Uh-oh.
[01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:19.430]  Coming for me, I got two health.
[01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:23.930]  This could be the end of Eric.
[01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.250]  It is.
[01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:26.330]  It's the end of Eric.
[01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:27.870]  Oh, two health.
[01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.090]  Goodbye, Mario Party March
[01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:33.370]  on Patreon.
[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:35.610]  Did you see that bounce?
[01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:37.510]  That was crazy.
[01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.610]  How'd that happen?
[01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:40.810]  And then I guess it plopped?
[01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.910]  Bummer.
[01:14:43.050 --> 01:14:43.890]  Oh, Dermal.
[01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:46.350]  Did Dermal go?
[01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:47.110]  Oh, shit.
[01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:48.970]  Right on the edge.
[01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:52.910]  Poor Dermal.
[01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:55.590]  Oh my god, look at how stacked
[01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.330]  it is right here.
[01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.950]  Uh, okay.
[01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:00.690]  I know what I have to do.
[01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.530]  Is it...
[01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:03.890]  Is it gonna be alright?
[01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:04.970]  Is it gonna be...
[01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:06.110]  No.
[01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:10.010]  No.
[01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:10.530]  You must.
[01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.890]  What?
[01:15:12.450 --> 01:15:13.450]  What the fuck?
[01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:15.210]  What just happened?
[01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:15.330]  Geoff.
[01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.610]  Geoff, you're in the rappel.
[01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.470]  Geoff, you're in the rappel.
[01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.450]  You moron.
[01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:25.050]  Geoff.
[01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:27.610]  Geoff, you're in the middle
[01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:28.490]  of the rappel.
[01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.110]  I can't move.
[01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:39.110]  Geoff wins!
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:40.250]  Geoff wins!
[01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.450]  I'm brilliant!
[01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:43.430]  Put the idiot flags
[01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:44.370]  in the chat!
[01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:47.710]  I wanna see those idiot flags!
[01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.430]  Yes!
[01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.070]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:53.850]  Imagine the Super Bowl
[01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.490]  winning that way. Holy shit.
[01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:56.070]  Wow.
[01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:58.970]  Unreal.
[01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.070]  Geoff, with a huge
[01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:05.550]  win. Do you believe
[01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:06.350]  in miracles?
[01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:08.610]  I can't believe it. That was awesome.
[01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.270]  Michael on ice all over again. Wow.
[01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:12.830]  Geoff, do you have anything to say
[01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:14.770]  to all of your fans who watched you
[01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.870]  gut that out and win the whole damn thing?
[01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:18.250]  Wouldn't have been able...
[01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:19.630]  I'm gonna be honest with you right now.
[01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:22.050]  I wouldn't have stood a chance of pulling through
[01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:24.610]  if it wasn't for the support of the Regulation listeners.
[01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.910]  My family,
[01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:30.470]  my coworkers, comment leavers,
[01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:32.130]  all of you, this victory
[01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.470]  is as much yours as it is mine.
[01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:35.910]  Let's share in it together.
[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:38.010]  And hey, a big round of
[01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.910]  applause and a thanks to the competitors out there
[01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:41.530]  who gave it all today.
[01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:43.790]  They left it out on the field. It might not have been enough
[01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:45.290]  today, but maybe it will be tomorrow.
[01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:47.790]  You really, you made
[01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:49.630]  your families, your spouses proud.
[01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:51.650]  It was a great day. It was a great day of competition
[01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:53.530]  and I couldn't be prouder of everybody.
[01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.690]  Way to go. I had the support of the girders
[01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.870]  and it didn't do shit. Yeah, it didn't do
[01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:58.570]  anything for you.
[01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:02.010]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
