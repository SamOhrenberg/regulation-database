[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Uh, did you- did you want to join?
[00:01.980 --> 00:03.100]  There we go, I'm in.
[00:03.700 --> 00:04.180]  There's Andrew.
[00:05.640 --> 00:08.480]  Gavin, if you're having issues, close it and rejoin it.
[00:08.520 --> 00:09.640]  I mean- oh, there we go.
[00:10.680 --> 00:12.080]  Alright, game starts in...
[00:12.080 --> 00:14.260]  Oh, we've got- no, we've got two identical...
[00:14.260 --> 00:15.420]  brick figs.
[00:15.480 --> 00:17.980]  Yeah, you're both sleepy, guys. Let's do this thing.
[00:18.100 --> 00:19.080]  Let's get tricky, boys.
[00:19.600 --> 00:21.080]  That's been a minute since I played this.
[00:21.620 --> 00:22.520]  Do you have the name bird?
[00:22.620 --> 00:26.240]  Oh, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely have the name bird in.
[00:27.000 --> 00:27.980]  How does this work again?
[00:28.380 --> 00:29.740]  Oh, we're next to each other, too.
[00:29.940 --> 00:31.120]  You just gotta, like, do it, you know?
[00:31.300 --> 00:32.360]  I'm on the right, guys.
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.740]  I'm the one not doing very well.
[00:36.100 --> 00:37.180]  Who's all the way on the left?
[00:37.400 --> 00:39.100]  I believe I am, I'm Geoff on the left.
[00:39.260 --> 00:42.340]  What do you mean, I believe? Why I believe?
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.200]  Because I thought briefly for a second
[00:44.200 --> 00:46.060]  maybe everybody is on the left
[00:46.060 --> 00:46.800]  on their screen.
[00:47.200 --> 00:47.740]  Could've happened.
[00:49.320 --> 00:50.400]  A lot of games do that.
[00:52.560 --> 00:53.840]  I am second
[00:53.840 --> 00:55.640]  from the left, I'm right next to Geoff.
[00:55.640 --> 00:58.460]  And then who's in the third slot?
[00:59.640 --> 01:00.400]  What did I just do?
[01:01.000 --> 01:01.500]  Thank you.
[01:02.380 --> 01:03.920]  And then finally on the right
[01:03.920 --> 01:04.420]  is Gavin.
[01:06.180 --> 01:07.040]  I can't remember.
[01:08.520 --> 01:10.740]  Burn those names into your brain
[01:10.740 --> 01:11.500]  and then you'll know.
[01:12.380 --> 01:12.520]  Yep.
[01:14.620 --> 01:15.580]  That's why we have, guys,
[01:15.680 --> 01:17.460]  that's why Nick is the MVP of this place, baby.
[01:21.900 --> 01:22.300]  Man.
[01:23.220 --> 01:24.580]  I forgot about this game.
[01:24.740 --> 01:25.360]  I love this game.
[01:25.360 --> 01:26.680]  It is a very good game.
[01:26.860 --> 01:28.400]  Why is the ceiling coming down?
[01:30.160 --> 01:32.940]  I'm a dick hole shitting my own ass.
[01:33.320 --> 01:34.900]  That was stupid.
[01:35.460 --> 01:37.360]  Andrew, that was stupid. Why did you do that?
[01:38.800 --> 01:39.580]  Is this gonna
[01:39.580 --> 01:40.700]  knock my shit?
[01:41.740 --> 01:43.600]  Nope. God damn it.
[01:44.300 --> 01:44.840]  Oh, thank God.
[01:45.660 --> 01:47.220]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.840]  I'm on the piss now.
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.940]  I'm on the piss now!
[01:51.520 --> 01:52.300]  Oh, Gavin!
[01:52.300 --> 01:54.100]  Alright, daddy's out.
[01:54.600 --> 01:56.560]  Daddy's out. Do I wanna be high
[01:56.560 --> 01:57.160]  or not?
[01:58.200 --> 02:00.220]  You wanna live for as long as you can.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.140]  Fuck dicks!
[02:01.860 --> 02:02.200]  Fuck!
[02:04.780 --> 02:05.840]  Don't remember.
[02:06.240 --> 02:07.980]  And I won!
[02:09.540 --> 02:10.060]  Boo!
[02:11.400 --> 02:12.060]  Boo!
[02:14.980 --> 02:15.300]  Damn.
[02:15.780 --> 02:16.980]  Zero points for me.
[02:18.060 --> 02:19.420]  Geoff, you been playing trucks?
[02:19.420 --> 02:21.520]  Uh, I haven't been playing
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.700]  any, no, I haven't really been playing anything at night
[02:23.700 --> 02:25.520]  with the boys just cause I was out of town
[02:25.520 --> 02:27.600]  for a couple days there and then we've just
[02:27.600 --> 02:29.540]  been going so hard.
[02:29.860 --> 02:31.860]  I've been going to bed at like
[02:32.700 --> 02:33.140]  9pm.
[02:33.840 --> 02:34.280]  Every night.
[02:35.240 --> 02:37.360]  Really? Yeah. This last two weeks has
[02:37.360 --> 02:39.640]  really taken a lot out of me. Physically.
[02:40.640 --> 02:41.920]  Oh! I completely
[02:41.920 --> 02:43.360]  forgot how this works.
[02:44.000 --> 02:44.460]  Fuck that up.
[02:45.380 --> 02:47.240]  For those wondering why we're not playing Limbo,
[02:47.240 --> 02:49.240]  we want us all to be here for that.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.840]  Yeah, hit Limbo!
[02:52.380 --> 02:53.260]  And uh, Nick
[02:53.260 --> 02:55.360]  is out. Yeah, Nick's
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.560]  not here. What just happened to my
[02:57.480 --> 02:57.880]  thing?
[02:58.840 --> 03:01.200]  You probably suck. I remember now how this works.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.600]  Now we're building under the line.
[03:03.500 --> 03:05.260]  Yeah, you try to get as many pieces
[03:05.260 --> 03:07.100]  as you can. Oh, Eric,
[03:07.280 --> 03:09.460]  that was fucking sneaky, that little one
[03:09.460 --> 03:11.260]  below! I can't believe you guys didn't see
[03:11.260 --> 03:13.040]  that. Oh, that was such a good move.
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.200]  Yeah. Get the little
[03:15.200 --> 03:17.340]  deal. You get the little deal down there.
[03:17.440 --> 03:19.300]  That was great. That's for the
[03:19.300 --> 03:21.420]  corn cats, baby. That's a corn cat move.
[03:22.340 --> 03:23.380]  Corn cats in the chat
[03:23.380 --> 03:24.540]  if you understand my moves.
[03:26.440 --> 03:27.320]  Piss rats if you're a little
[03:27.320 --> 03:29.180]  freak. Survival
[03:29.180 --> 03:31.260]  special, okay? I think
[03:31.260 --> 03:33.220]  this is what we did before, right?
[03:33.620 --> 03:35.200]  Yeah, I think so. Gavin, if you
[03:35.200 --> 03:37.260]  saw a cat eating corn in real life, like, what
[03:37.260 --> 03:38.500]  would that do to you, do you think?
[03:40.520 --> 03:41.240]  Uh, wouldn't
[03:41.240 --> 03:43.380]  change a lot. You don't think so?
[03:43.380 --> 03:44.860]  You don't think he'd be like a different man?
[03:44.980 --> 03:47.260]  I'd go and look at it for a bit, obviously, but...
[03:47.260 --> 03:49.080]  Go and look at it for a bit!
[03:49.460 --> 03:50.460]  What am I gonna do with this?
[03:52.860 --> 03:53.360]  Oh my
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.820]  god. Oh my god.
[03:55.220 --> 03:57.260]  Well, that sucked. Well, I thought it was
[03:57.260 --> 03:59.300]  fine. Is that
[03:59.300 --> 03:59.460]  right?
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.320]  Oh, is that locked in
[04:03.320 --> 04:03.920]  now? That's good.
[04:07.120 --> 04:07.440]  Whoa,
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.140]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no, no!
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.480]  Wait, what did it do? Oh, we can't
[04:11.480 --> 04:11.880]  see.
[04:13.460 --> 04:14.680]  I've got yuck.
[04:15.240 --> 04:17.420]  Oh, no. That sucked. Nope.
[04:17.840 --> 04:19.360]  Oh, that's shit. Also sucks.
[04:19.720 --> 04:21.580]  I hate to get the clouds
[04:21.580 --> 04:23.140]  out of here! Oh, extra sucky!
[04:23.820 --> 04:25.780]  Geoff, you fuckin' idiot.
[04:27.120 --> 04:27.300]  Oh.
[04:29.420 --> 04:30.500]  There we go.
[04:30.780 --> 04:32.920]  Let's get this down here. No!
[04:33.620 --> 04:35.300]  I fuckin' hate the clouds!
[04:35.780 --> 04:36.800]  Now what's this?
[04:37.200 --> 04:37.360]  Oh!
[04:37.360 --> 04:37.500]  Oh!
[04:38.120 --> 04:40.820]  Okay, okay, okay.
[04:40.920 --> 04:42.780]  Oh my god, Gavin! Gavin!
[04:43.240 --> 04:43.620]  Gavin!
[04:46.400 --> 04:47.240]  Man, you know
[04:47.240 --> 04:48.260]  who I'm jealous of?
[04:48.760 --> 04:51.100]  All the people who weren't born me.
[04:51.500 --> 04:52.980]  God damn. Oh no. Oh no.
[04:53.320 --> 04:53.980]  Oh no!
[04:55.880 --> 04:57.080]  Oh, I'm hurtin'.
[04:57.080 --> 04:59.580]  Oh, I'm hurtin' for certain. Oh, it's bad!
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.000]  Oh, that's it. Oh, I'm out.
[05:01.480 --> 05:02.960]  I'm out. Damn.
[05:05.200 --> 05:06.900]  Geoff, that was a hell of a run you were doing, though.
[05:06.940 --> 05:07.460]  Look at that.
[05:08.260 --> 05:10.740]  It's path in the chat with the burn.
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.360]  You guys can look at the top.
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.060]  It's Geoff, Eric, Andrew, Gavin.
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.700]  In that order, left to right.
[05:16.020 --> 05:18.980]  They put that in the chat so everyone knows. These are some tricky-ass towers, baby.
[05:19.220 --> 05:19.920]  That's what I'm talking about.
[05:20.100 --> 05:22.140]  Rockies are up 2-0 on Tampa.
[05:23.260 --> 05:24.520]  Okay. Puzzle normal.
[05:24.640 --> 05:26.640]  I think Tampa might make the playoffs. You think so?
[05:27.420 --> 05:28.700]  Yeah, they're kinda like sneaky.
[05:29.120 --> 05:30.400]  I think they're gonna be a sneaky team.
[05:31.720 --> 05:32.640]  I don't think they're gonna be
[05:32.640 --> 05:34.440]  good, like great, but I think
[05:34.440 --> 05:36.780]  they're gonna have a sneaky year.
[05:37.940 --> 05:38.060]  Hmm.
[05:40.140 --> 05:40.780]  Maybe?
[05:41.960 --> 05:42.560]  Maybe?
[05:43.780 --> 05:44.420]  Well...
[05:45.320 --> 05:45.960]  Shit.
[05:46.720 --> 05:48.760]  I leave that there.
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.280]  I feel good about that one.
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.580]  Well, God...
[05:52.580 --> 05:54.220]  Frickin' what?
[05:54.680 --> 05:55.020]  No!
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.680]  This is not good for me.
[06:02.320 --> 06:03.880]  Ooh, this might have to be my last one.
[06:04.100 --> 06:05.600]  Can I jam this in, do you think?
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.260]  No, you can't.
[06:07.320 --> 06:08.660]  Use the bumpers, use the bumpers.
[06:09.120 --> 06:10.700]  Well, damn, what happened to me?
[06:11.760 --> 06:13.120]  I don't know, you didn't hit the bumpers.
[06:13.800 --> 06:15.720]  Alright, timing is everything, Geoff.
[06:16.340 --> 06:17.700]  Oh, that's such a good move.
[06:18.300 --> 06:18.980]  There we go.
[06:19.340 --> 06:20.920]  Oh, what a move!
[06:21.800 --> 06:23.880]  And that's it. I got nowhere to go.
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.060]  What?
[06:25.240 --> 06:25.680]  No!
[06:26.080 --> 06:26.400]  No!
[06:27.540 --> 06:29.140]  Andrew just didn't pay attention?
[06:29.340 --> 06:31.720]  No, I was trying to attach it to the side.
[06:32.060 --> 06:32.620]  Can you do that?
[06:33.500 --> 06:35.020]  I don't think it attaches to the side.
[06:35.340 --> 06:36.900]  I think you're supposed to set it.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.940]  Oh, I won. I think you set it and then it grabs the one
[06:39.940 --> 06:41.320]  like near it and it hangs on to it.
[06:41.420 --> 06:42.520]  I would have liked to have known.
[06:43.980 --> 06:45.040]  Uh, but I missed.
[06:46.200 --> 06:47.920]  I tried to get it as low as I could on it.
[06:48.620 --> 06:49.180]  You're a mess.
[06:49.300 --> 06:50.000]  I mean, it was a good effort.
[06:50.000 --> 06:50.260]  I am.
[06:56.180 --> 06:58.180]  Alright, let's see.
[06:59.720 --> 07:00.260]  What's the
[07:00.260 --> 07:01.140]  slam down button?
[07:02.540 --> 07:03.440]  What do you mean?
[07:03.520 --> 07:04.240]  I think you just hold down.
[07:05.160 --> 07:06.540]  Yeah, is it not just hold down?
[07:06.780 --> 07:09.420]  Yeah, but what?
[07:09.920 --> 07:12.080]  Well, you know in Tetris there's like hold down and it goes down
[07:12.080 --> 07:13.260]  but there's also the slam down.
[07:14.000 --> 07:14.580]  Oh, I don't know.
[07:14.700 --> 07:17.560]  I don't know if that's a thing in this game.
[07:17.560 --> 07:18.880]  You used to press up.
[07:20.400 --> 07:21.040]  Press up here?
[07:21.240 --> 07:23.400]  Yeah, up makes it flip
[07:23.400 --> 07:24.760]  turn. Flips the flop.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.740]  It does flip the flop.
[07:27.980 --> 07:28.580]  I have seen it.
[07:30.700 --> 07:31.520]  Oh, nice.
[07:31.740 --> 07:32.580]  Okay, that's a good move.
[07:35.080 --> 07:35.440]  Okay.
[07:35.580 --> 07:36.180]  Oh, what are you doing?
[07:36.320 --> 07:36.760]  You guys go to hell.
[07:38.460 --> 07:40.700]  Oh, you guys going to hell?
[07:41.520 --> 07:43.460]  No, no, no, no, don't send me to hell!
[07:44.940 --> 07:45.820]  Give me a piano
[07:45.820 --> 07:46.400]  I can't see anything.
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.580]  Geoff sent me to hell.
[07:49.740 --> 07:50.680]  Geoff sent me straight to hell.
[07:50.940 --> 07:52.520]  Hell is other people.
[07:56.800 --> 07:58.940]  A little Sartre for today?
[07:59.920 --> 08:00.420]  Thanks, man.
[08:00.660 --> 08:01.040]  No problem.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.200]  Ugh, this is rough.
[08:05.620 --> 08:07.240]  Ow! Penis.
[08:07.420 --> 08:08.360]  This is rough trade, boys.
[08:09.680 --> 08:10.640]  Oh, shitballs.
[08:11.580 --> 08:12.880]  Oh, double penis.
[08:12.880 --> 08:14.900]  Oh, I hit the wrong button.
[08:16.340 --> 08:17.460]  Oh, no.
[08:21.280 --> 08:22.820]  Andrew Dice Clay's here?
[08:26.460 --> 08:28.020]  No, why?
[08:28.560 --> 08:30.100]  That's not what happens.
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.140]  Why'd you do that?
[08:32.880 --> 08:33.920]  Oh, no.
[08:34.360 --> 08:35.360]  That's not good.
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.900]  Oh, boy. Stop.
[08:38.300 --> 08:39.060]  Oh, fuck.
[08:39.060 --> 08:40.240]  Oh, God.
[08:40.480 --> 08:41.480]  This is bad now.
[08:41.720 --> 08:43.260]  Oh, you cock.
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.760]  Oh, you cock end. End of the penis.
[08:47.480 --> 08:48.560]  Oh, wizard out.
[08:48.680 --> 08:50.000]  Dude, I have not won one of these.
[08:50.240 --> 08:50.680]  Damn it.
[08:51.280 --> 08:51.500]  Boo.
[08:53.760 --> 08:54.240]  Boo.
[08:58.420 --> 08:59.380]  Damn it.
[09:01.620 --> 09:03.520]  Oh, I needed those.
[09:05.380 --> 09:06.340]  Poor Geoff.
[09:06.340 --> 09:08.020]  If I agree, I agree, regulation guy.
[09:08.060 --> 09:09.880]  I don't know why. I don't want poor Geoff.
[09:10.120 --> 09:11.680]  But I guarantee you I agree.
[09:12.500 --> 09:13.620]  Many are saying this.
[09:16.200 --> 09:18.240]  You've just joined us. I'm on the right.
[09:18.340 --> 09:19.780]  Geoff's on the left. Where are the other two?
[09:19.820 --> 09:21.740]  If you've just joined us, poor Geoff.
[09:21.940 --> 09:23.800]  Where are the other two?
[09:25.260 --> 09:25.760]  Oh, no.
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.720]  What do I want to do?
[09:28.760 --> 09:29.640]  Do I want to do this?
[09:29.960 --> 09:30.600]  I guess I do.
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.520]  What does the lightning do?
[09:33.140 --> 09:35.040]  I don't know. I'm afraid to find out.
[09:36.520 --> 09:37.460]  Does it do this?
[09:37.800 --> 09:39.100]  Oh, it just gets rid of one.
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.480]  I don't think you want to do that in this, do you?
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.080]  Well, in an emergency, that'd be nice, wouldn't it?
[09:46.320 --> 09:47.880]  Ah, it got rid of the wrong one for me.
[09:47.980 --> 09:48.600]  I thought it was the one...
[09:48.980 --> 09:49.440]  Oh, shit.
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.420]  Oh, shit again.
[09:53.820 --> 09:55.780]  Geoff might be struggling, fellas.
[09:56.040 --> 09:57.940]  Is this too much for the weight of it?
[09:58.020 --> 09:58.960]  Is that going to tip it?
[09:59.600 --> 10:00.580]  No, come on!
[10:00.960 --> 10:01.320]  Shit!
[10:01.860 --> 10:03.180]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[10:07.880 --> 10:08.780]  Alright, god damn it.
[10:08.860 --> 10:09.900]  Get it right.
[10:10.700 --> 10:11.440]  There we go.
[10:12.300 --> 10:13.640]  There you go.
[10:14.460 --> 10:16.720]  Alright, god damn it.
[10:16.760 --> 10:17.440]  Get it right again.
[10:17.800 --> 10:18.660]  I think we just have to end it.
[10:18.760 --> 10:20.760]  We just have to be happy with what we got.
[10:22.740 --> 10:24.240]  Not happy? I'm not happy?
[10:26.420 --> 10:27.580]  Equally not happy?
[10:28.700 --> 10:29.340]  Can this go to that?
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.280]  No!
[10:31.020 --> 10:31.780]  Oh, Gavin.
[10:32.020 --> 10:36.500]  Oh, poor Gavin.
[10:37.260 --> 10:41.000]  Oh, shit.
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.140]  I think Andrew won it.
[10:46.220 --> 10:47.180]  Come on.
[10:48.700 --> 10:49.340]  Yeah!
[10:50.400 --> 10:51.460]  Way to go, Andrew.
[10:51.700 --> 10:54.220]  Way to go, man.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.440]  Oh, I'm only one away.
[10:56.800 --> 10:57.120]  Wow.
[10:57.260 --> 10:58.760]  Yeah, and you need to come dead last.
[11:00.520 --> 11:01.640]  Ah, do it Nick style.
[11:02.080 --> 11:02.880]  Pretty even game.
[11:03.420 --> 11:04.020]  Race special!
[11:06.580 --> 11:09.360]  Guys, Mark the Frog is here.
[11:09.460 --> 11:10.920]  And he's here for the race special.
[11:11.720 --> 11:13.640]  Did we just put him in a video game the other day?
[11:13.780 --> 11:14.320]  What was that?
[11:14.380 --> 11:18.540]  We talked about him in Monster Hunter.
[11:18.920 --> 11:19.500]  That's what it was.
[11:20.140 --> 11:22.800]  Oh, and then we played Repo, I think.
[11:22.820 --> 11:23.720]  And we said it was Mark the Frog.
[11:23.720 --> 11:24.580]  Right, right, right.
[11:24.660 --> 11:26.800]  He tried to kill us.
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:28.440 --> 11:29.720]  Oh, shit, it's Mark the Frog.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.840]  I fell apart in this one, fellas.
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.300]  I don't know about this.
[11:37.920 --> 11:38.300]  Oh, no.
[11:38.840 --> 11:40.580]  Oh, boy. Fuck me.
[11:41.060 --> 11:41.700]  I'm stupid.
[11:43.720 --> 11:45.420]  What is someone doing?
[11:46.180 --> 11:46.880]  Yeah, that was me.
[11:47.300 --> 11:48.160]  Why'd you do that?
[11:50.140 --> 11:50.840]  Wasn't funny?
[11:50.840 --> 11:51.500]  That was unfortunate by me.
[11:52.780 --> 11:55.180]  If it wasn't happening to me, it would have been funny.
[11:55.540 --> 11:55.740]  Wow.
[11:56.080 --> 11:58.620]  Oh, it's windy. That's why that's happening.
[11:59.240 --> 11:59.820]  Windage.
[12:04.440 --> 12:06.500]  Oh, no, no, no.
[12:06.620 --> 12:07.180]  I hit the wrong button.
[12:07.560 --> 12:08.160]  Oh, no.
[12:09.660 --> 12:10.780]  Get more height.
[12:13.220 --> 12:13.800]  Whoops.
[12:14.140 --> 12:15.280]  Dude, wow.
[12:15.780 --> 12:17.140]  That is unfortunate.
[12:17.140 --> 12:19.380]  The wind is crazy.
[12:21.460 --> 12:22.780]  I'm in the yuck zone.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.040]  There we go.
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.400]  Stupid fucking block.
[12:28.300 --> 12:29.080]  Damn it.
[12:29.140 --> 12:30.080]  Did I want that? No.
[12:33.260 --> 12:36.640]  No, no, no. I hit the wrong button.
[12:37.340 --> 12:39.000]  My tower got tricky.
[12:39.640 --> 12:40.360]  My tower.
[12:41.440 --> 12:42.040]  Why?
[12:43.100 --> 12:43.940]  It evaporated.
[12:45.940 --> 12:46.940]  There we go.
[12:46.940 --> 12:47.460]  No.
[12:50.280 --> 12:52.120]  My tower got de-towered.
[12:52.460 --> 12:53.420]  Did it really?
[12:54.180 --> 12:54.920]  Oh, my God.
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.800]  The wind is brutal.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.240]  That sucked.
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.840]  Did it? What did it do?
[13:06.440 --> 13:08.380]  It fucking made everything go gammy on me
[13:08.380 --> 13:09.640]  as I was trying to place a block.
[13:10.100 --> 13:10.780]  It's got the gams.
[13:10.780 --> 13:12.420]  Oh, give me that.
[13:12.800 --> 13:13.200]  No.
[13:13.760 --> 13:14.380]  No.
[13:15.140 --> 13:19.280]  Geoff, from first to fourth.
[13:19.520 --> 13:19.740]  No.
[13:20.420 --> 13:22.400]  I was killing it.
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.260]  I got killed by it.
[13:25.400 --> 13:26.260]  It's too ugly.
[13:30.640 --> 13:31.900]  Get that.
[13:32.380 --> 13:33.700]  You piece of...
[13:33.700 --> 13:34.980]  What just happened?
[13:35.340 --> 13:35.800]  No.
[13:35.800 --> 13:36.560]  No.
[13:38.700 --> 13:40.280]  It all fell apart.
[13:40.380 --> 13:41.920]  I had it. I was about to win.
[13:42.020 --> 13:43.500]  I was about to kill you fools.
[13:43.800 --> 13:44.900]  Why did that do that?
[13:46.020 --> 13:47.340]  Yes, yes, yes.
[13:47.400 --> 13:48.360]  Three, two, no.
[13:49.140 --> 13:51.400]  Nothing will take on this stupid platform.
[13:52.280 --> 13:52.840]  I got it.
[13:52.940 --> 13:53.080]  No.
[13:55.500 --> 13:57.060]  Cock-a-doodle-dick.
[13:58.100 --> 13:58.600]  Damn it.
[13:59.240 --> 14:00.440]  Random Sarah, thank you.
[14:01.900 --> 14:02.540]  Damn it.
[14:02.540 --> 14:03.160]  Is that what I needed?
[14:03.540 --> 14:04.980]  No, you keep it third.
[14:06.000 --> 14:06.740]  Damn it.
[14:07.040 --> 14:09.060]  Me and Geoff.
[14:12.760 --> 14:13.160]  Overtime.
[14:13.780 --> 14:14.520]  Are we all in it?
[14:16.060 --> 14:16.420]  No, no.
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.440]  Oh God, this is going to be scary.
[14:22.880 --> 14:23.740]  No, I hit the wrong button.
[14:24.140 --> 14:25.400]  Alright, I can do this.
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.020]  I can do this.
[14:27.440 --> 14:27.840]  Yep.
[14:27.840 --> 14:28.040]  Yep.
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.220]  I can do this.
[14:32.220 --> 14:32.740]  Oh my God.
[14:32.800 --> 14:35.060]  I just blew it so hard.
[14:35.940 --> 14:37.480]  Oh shit.
[14:37.920 --> 14:38.500]  Got it in.
[14:41.180 --> 14:41.480]  What?
[14:44.220 --> 14:45.040]  No.
[14:46.620 --> 14:47.480]  Yep.
[14:48.300 --> 14:49.140]  Got it.
[14:49.180 --> 14:49.400]  No.
[14:53.730 --> 14:55.580]  What happened to me?
[14:57.240 --> 14:58.860]  I can't get in.
[15:02.230 --> 15:03.150]  Get in.
[15:07.940 --> 15:08.600]  Yes.
[15:10.680 --> 15:13.140]  We're locked in right now.
[15:13.800 --> 15:13.820]  Fuck.
[15:14.820 --> 15:15.580]  Oh no.
[15:16.800 --> 15:17.240]  No.
[15:20.700 --> 15:22.080]  Come on, God damn it.
[15:22.660 --> 15:23.940]  I'm on a flat, nice flat.
[15:24.140 --> 15:24.700]  Right there.
[15:27.120 --> 15:28.480]  I can put this, that's fine.
[15:30.440 --> 15:30.840]  No.
[15:34.240 --> 15:34.500]  Okay.
[15:36.180 --> 15:37.400]  I gotta be okay with it.
[15:37.600 --> 15:38.580]  Gotta be okay with it.
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.840]  My shit's so jank.
[15:41.600 --> 15:42.660]  It's not going to stay.
[15:45.300 --> 15:46.420]  Corn cats if I won.
[15:46.720 --> 15:48.360]  Everyone show me corn cats if you think I won.
[15:49.280 --> 15:50.380]  Show me corn cats.
[15:50.640 --> 15:53.080]  What you have is so much better than what we all have.
[15:53.080 --> 15:54.660]  Show me da cats.
[15:55.860 --> 15:57.200]  Show me da cats.
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.220]  I mean Geoff's doing well, but Gavin and I.
[15:59.940 --> 16:01.500]  Yeah, I'm having a meh.
[16:01.900 --> 16:05.200]  Oh, great move.
[16:06.500 --> 16:08.660]  How do you shoo it in real good?
[16:09.420 --> 16:10.580]  Left bumper or right bumper?
[16:12.420 --> 16:13.460]  You idiot.
[16:14.200 --> 16:16.000]  Easier said than fucking done though.
[16:16.200 --> 16:17.940]  Uh oh.
[16:18.540 --> 16:19.340]  Oh no.
[16:22.180 --> 16:22.760]  Dangerous.
[16:23.180 --> 16:24.320]  Show me the corn cats.
[16:24.320 --> 16:25.420]  Get the piss rats out of here.
[16:25.480 --> 16:26.480]  Show me corn cats only.
[16:30.580 --> 16:34.940]  Andrew, you're an insane person.
[16:35.900 --> 16:37.300]  I think Eric's got this.
[16:37.620 --> 16:38.940]  Yeah, he did really well.
[16:38.940 --> 16:40.740]  Come on, come on.
[16:41.200 --> 16:41.660]  Whoa!
[16:45.340 --> 16:46.300]  That was unbelievable.
[16:46.840 --> 16:50.020]  Let's get some piss rats in the chat for that.
[16:50.560 --> 16:51.960]  Way to go, Geoff.
[16:51.960 --> 16:53.520]  Way to go, Geoff.
[16:53.620 --> 16:55.140]  Thank you very much.
[16:55.320 --> 16:57.040]  Geoff, that was huge.
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.160]  That was intense.
[16:59.900 --> 17:01.560]  Geoff's a tricky little guy, man.
[17:01.920 --> 17:02.440]  Wow.
[17:02.540 --> 17:04.840]  I cannot get the things in the hole.
[17:06.620 --> 17:07.200]  Goodness.
[17:08.240 --> 17:08.800]  Wow.
[17:09.060 --> 17:10.240]  Let's get another one going.
[17:13.660 --> 17:15.180]  I'm locked in.
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.320]  I'm locked in.
[17:17.080 --> 17:18.340]  Let's do it.
[17:18.340 --> 17:20.480]  Oh no, not the wind again.
[17:20.600 --> 17:21.900]  Oh, I hate the wind.
[17:22.120 --> 17:23.060]  The wind's a real motherfucker.
[17:25.320 --> 17:28.500]  Okay, let's get a good foundation going.
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.420]  I think that's where I went wrong last time.
[17:30.940 --> 17:31.960]  Is that what happened?
[17:32.040 --> 17:32.320]  Yep.
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.700]  You blew it on the foundation.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.520]  I blew it on the foundation.
[17:39.320 --> 17:40.040]  It happens.
[17:40.940 --> 17:42.860]  It happens to most homes here in Austin.
[17:42.860 --> 17:46.120]  I blew it on the foundation.
[17:51.050 --> 17:55.410]  You fucking toad noise making little freak, dude.
[17:57.010 --> 17:57.770]  I did it again.
[17:57.890 --> 17:58.850]  I blew it on the foundation again.
[17:59.030 --> 18:00.650]  I blew it on the foundation again in a panic.
[18:01.670 --> 18:03.370]  I've got to get this stuff locked in.
[18:03.890 --> 18:05.050]  I need some lockage.
[18:06.270 --> 18:06.770]  Lock me in.
[18:07.230 --> 18:07.930]  Wow, you idiot.
[18:09.850 --> 18:11.170]  Don't talk to Gavin like that.
[18:11.230 --> 18:13.150]  I wish I was talking to Gavin.
[18:13.150 --> 18:14.570]  I tried my hardest.
[18:17.650 --> 18:19.330]  Oh, I hit the wrong button.
[18:19.650 --> 18:21.830]  Oh, fucking kill yourself, Geoff.
[18:21.990 --> 18:22.830]  Jesus Christ.
[18:25.390 --> 18:26.010]  Jesus.
[18:26.970 --> 18:28.070]  That's what I'm saying.
[18:28.590 --> 18:30.290]  Oh, you...
[18:30.290 --> 18:32.630]  Oh my God.
[18:33.270 --> 18:34.690]  And this is what you do with it.
[18:35.070 --> 18:36.010]  You suck.
[18:39.250 --> 18:40.490]  Chill out.
[18:43.150 --> 18:43.690]  Oh my God.
[18:44.570 --> 18:45.630]  What is this ice bullshit?
[18:46.270 --> 18:47.610]  What's the ice doing for me?
[18:48.070 --> 18:49.630]  I don't know. Is it good?
[18:49.970 --> 18:50.130]  No.
[18:50.950 --> 18:52.510]  How do I not have ice?
[18:53.410 --> 18:54.590]  I thought you liked it.
[18:56.730 --> 18:59.630]  The whole bloody shed flew off.
[19:00.210 --> 19:02.630]  I don't think you did think we liked it.
[19:03.850 --> 19:05.930]  I thought maybe you liked it a little bit.
[19:08.230 --> 19:08.790]  Windage.
[19:09.270 --> 19:10.390]  There we go.
[19:10.410 --> 19:12.550]  Dude, my icing lasted so long.
[19:12.770 --> 19:13.070]  No!
[19:13.470 --> 19:15.970]  What if everything's heavy, though?
[19:16.350 --> 19:17.190]  Oh, God.
[19:18.010 --> 19:19.410]  You gotta fucking...
[19:20.230 --> 19:22.290]  Well, see you later.
[19:23.690 --> 19:24.930]  Alright, just keep that there.
[19:25.310 --> 19:26.230]  Just go back to start.
[19:26.470 --> 19:26.930]  Oh, no.
[19:27.530 --> 19:28.290]  Just start from scratch.
[19:30.970 --> 19:32.370]  I'm in the foundation hell.
[19:33.110 --> 19:34.650]  That's about as dog shit as it gets.
[19:40.030 --> 19:40.810]  God damn it.
[19:40.910 --> 19:41.430]  Here we go.
[19:41.470 --> 19:43.730]  It's weird. This game, I see myself panicking.
[19:43.930 --> 19:44.290]  All done, boys.
[19:44.850 --> 19:45.510]  You made it?
[19:46.930 --> 19:47.350]  Locked in.
[19:56.270 --> 19:57.630]  Eric returns in the Avengers.
[20:00.530 --> 20:01.350]  I'll take a second.
[20:03.910 --> 20:04.590]  How you doing, Geoff?
[20:04.590 --> 20:05.890]  I did bad.
[20:06.290 --> 20:07.850]  I did real bad there.
[20:08.930 --> 20:10.530]  Slot the nuggies again.
[20:11.290 --> 20:12.230]  Yeah, it was a tough one.
[20:15.430 --> 20:17.270]  So you just gotta...
[20:18.410 --> 20:19.270]  Double up.
[20:22.290 --> 20:25.070]  No, I fucking...
[20:26.050 --> 20:30.930]  Not sure about what he said there.
[20:34.590 --> 20:35.250]  I don't even know.
[20:36.510 --> 20:38.290]  Just pain. That's all I know.
[20:39.590 --> 20:41.030]  All I know is pain.
[20:44.110 --> 20:45.430]  Oh, that was good.
[20:45.750 --> 20:47.750]  I can do this.
[20:48.690 --> 20:50.070]  Dude, this will be sexy.
[20:50.870 --> 20:51.450]  Pop it in.
[20:52.370 --> 20:54.530]  Nailed it. That was good. That was real good.
[20:56.170 --> 20:58.910]  Fuck. That could have been so much better.
[21:00.290 --> 21:01.610]  That's time to say...
[21:01.610 --> 21:03.450]  You fucking popping sex over there?
[21:03.470 --> 21:05.370]  I hear it could have been so much better.
[21:07.170 --> 21:08.650]  Not the first time you've heard that, right?
[21:08.790 --> 21:09.510]  Oh my God.
[21:12.210 --> 21:12.930]  Popping sex.
[21:14.150 --> 21:15.350]  Oh, I hit the wrong button.
[21:15.430 --> 21:17.010]  Oh my God, it landed for me.
[21:17.510 --> 21:18.710]  God was on my...
[21:18.710 --> 21:20.170]  Guys, God was never on your side.
[21:20.250 --> 21:21.110]  God was on my side.
[21:21.250 --> 21:23.070]  What just happened?
[21:23.970 --> 21:24.310]  God.
[21:24.310 --> 21:24.590]  Okay.
[21:25.910 --> 21:26.390]  No!
[21:27.310 --> 21:29.310]  I shouldn't be allowed to play this game.
[21:30.390 --> 21:30.870]  Okay.
[21:31.650 --> 21:33.390]  God was never on your side.
[21:34.790 --> 21:36.230]  I think that's pretty clear.
[21:36.370 --> 21:36.950]  Is this going to fall?
[21:37.430 --> 21:39.030]  I don't think that was ever in dispute.
[21:42.110 --> 21:43.930]  Let me eat this in.
[21:46.110 --> 21:46.350]  Oh!
[21:47.670 --> 21:49.750]  Bloody hell, I can't even believe that worked.
[21:49.750 --> 21:50.170]  Oh.
[21:52.850 --> 21:54.450]  Oh, you're so annoying, Eric.
[21:54.710 --> 21:56.170]  Your tower's so good.
[21:56.450 --> 21:58.670]  I bumped it too hard.
[21:58.890 --> 21:59.710]  I flew too close.
[22:00.350 --> 22:03.070]  Like Icarus, I flew too close to the sun.
[22:03.610 --> 22:05.710]  I should have listened to Iron Maiden.
[22:06.330 --> 22:08.070]  The flight of Icarus.
[22:08.070 --> 22:08.830]  It doomed me.
[22:09.870 --> 22:12.750]  Did they ever make a sequel to Kid Icarus?
[22:14.770 --> 22:15.410]  Haven't they?
[22:15.470 --> 22:17.070]  I'm sure it was a game on the Wii, right?
[22:17.070 --> 22:19.270]  Probably, or like some 64 game
[22:19.270 --> 22:20.190]  that just didn't do well.
[22:21.050 --> 22:21.310]  Andrew.
[22:24.150 --> 22:25.090]  Andrew's locked in
[22:25.090 --> 22:25.750]  and it's not good.
[22:25.950 --> 22:28.450]  No, I fail once and then it just all collapses.
[22:28.790 --> 22:29.710]  Look at him go.
[22:29.890 --> 22:31.210]  Look at him go.
[22:32.150 --> 22:32.630]  Oh.
[22:35.390 --> 22:35.870]  Oh.
[22:36.910 --> 22:37.870]  Oh, no.
[22:39.790 --> 22:41.090]  There really is one
[22:41.090 --> 22:42.930]  bad move from Andrew and the whole thing
[22:42.930 --> 22:44.390]  falls apart around him. It's so sad.
[22:44.390 --> 22:45.490]  Alright.
[22:46.930 --> 22:48.470]  Can I put this on here?
[22:48.890 --> 22:49.630]  Can this go here?
[22:51.390 --> 22:51.790]  Oh.
[22:53.110 --> 22:53.710]  Oh.
[22:55.770 --> 22:57.950]  Going for a big move here. Going for a big move.
[23:00.450 --> 23:01.050]  What?
[23:01.410 --> 23:03.790]  That seemed like the worst
[23:03.790 --> 23:05.790]  idea on earth.
[23:06.150 --> 23:10.670]  Oh, what did you do?
[23:11.230 --> 23:11.630]  Huh.
[23:12.810 --> 23:14.590]  Hey, Geoff, you know what we should start wearing?
[23:14.850 --> 23:16.450]  Is those, uh...
[23:16.450 --> 23:18.430]  I think Tom Hanks wore it to the Oscars.
[23:18.590 --> 23:20.650]  It's like a collared shirt, but without the
[23:20.650 --> 23:22.570]  collar. You know what I'm talking about?
[23:22.870 --> 23:23.950]  Like Gus used to wear?
[23:24.930 --> 23:26.170]  Is that what Gus used to wear?
[23:26.310 --> 23:28.770]  Gus used to wear a button-up shirt
[23:28.770 --> 23:30.510]  without a collar in the early 2000s.
[23:30.510 --> 23:32.010]  Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We should do that.
[23:32.170 --> 23:32.750]  We should do that.
[23:35.230 --> 23:36.390]  Colorless collared shirts.
[23:36.730 --> 23:37.370]  Gavin won.
[23:38.070 --> 23:38.430]  Wow.
[23:39.650 --> 23:41.710]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[23:43.190 --> 23:43.750]  How'd I go?
[23:46.450 --> 23:48.190]  He did it for Mark the Frog, I can tell.
[23:48.450 --> 23:50.490]  Did you ever have a jumper with a collar of a shirt
[23:50.490 --> 23:52.010]  underneath, but the shirt wasn't there?
[23:52.270 --> 23:54.050]  What? What is a jumper?
[23:54.330 --> 23:55.850]  Is that a sweater? Is a jumper a sweater?
[23:56.230 --> 23:58.210]  Uh, no, but I know what
[23:58.210 --> 24:00.170]  you're talking about. No, I never had that.
[24:01.370 --> 24:02.310]  Ah, they were great.
[24:02.810 --> 24:04.330]  That's like a little too preppy
[24:04.330 --> 24:05.010]  for me, I think.
[24:05.530 --> 24:06.670]  They were good in the summer.
[24:08.190 --> 24:09.570]  When you had to look like a twat.
[24:09.910 --> 24:11.170]  Right, right, right.
[24:15.690 --> 24:17.350]  A sweater in the summer didn't make any sense
[24:17.350 --> 24:18.950]  to me when I was like, alright, it's England.
[24:19.130 --> 24:19.650]  England, England, England.
[24:20.710 --> 24:22.510]  Summer is in, like, it's
[24:22.510 --> 24:25.070]  25 in the day and then minus 2 at night.
[24:25.810 --> 24:26.150]  Right.
[24:26.430 --> 24:29.170]  When you look back on, like, fashion
[24:29.170 --> 24:31.050]  that you participated in, what are you most
[24:31.050 --> 24:31.790]  embarrassed about?
[24:32.450 --> 24:34.170]  Oh, that's a great question.
[24:36.670 --> 24:37.090]  Um...
[24:37.750 --> 24:39.850]  What is it? What am I embarrassed about?
[24:41.510 --> 24:42.610]  Bootcut jeans, probably.
[24:42.950 --> 24:43.850]  Bootcut jeans
[24:43.850 --> 24:45.970]  is a good one. Bootcut jeans
[24:45.970 --> 24:48.190]  are up there, and I know they're making
[24:48.190 --> 24:49.430]  like a little bit of a comeback,
[24:50.270 --> 24:51.870]  but, uh, I do think
[24:51.870 --> 24:53.870]  bootcut jeans are probably up there
[24:53.870 --> 24:55.810]  in terms of, like, what did I wear
[24:55.810 --> 24:56.810]  that was, like, so bad?
[24:58.930 --> 24:59.790]  Other than that,
[24:59.790 --> 25:01.670]  I don't know that there was a ton
[25:01.670 --> 25:03.790]  that I was super embarrassed about. I think I was just a very
[25:04.250 --> 25:05.770]  child of the 90s, so it's
[25:05.770 --> 25:07.990]  like, how many Osiris
[25:07.990 --> 25:09.510]  shoes could I wear, you know what I mean?
[25:09.610 --> 25:11.810]  It's just a lot of that. Big puffy shoes.
[25:12.650 --> 25:13.050]  Chill out.
[25:14.090 --> 25:14.370]  No!
[25:15.350 --> 25:16.910]  Can we not with the ice, do you think?
[25:17.810 --> 25:18.310]  Chill out?
[25:19.590 --> 25:20.590]  It's ice hell.
[25:21.350 --> 25:22.390]  Geoff, what do you think yours is?
[25:23.150 --> 25:24.910]  I think for me it's cardigans
[25:26.070 --> 25:26.790]  and turtlenecks.
[25:26.790 --> 25:27.230]  No!
[25:29.490 --> 25:30.790]  Turtlenecks were a real big deal
[25:30.790 --> 25:32.770]  when I was in, like, 10th and 11th grade
[25:32.770 --> 25:34.710]  and everybody wore them.
[25:36.470 --> 25:36.850]  Turtleneck
[25:36.850 --> 25:38.650]  in Alabama in June, you know?
[25:39.490 --> 25:40.410]  That's a tough one.
[25:40.750 --> 25:41.590]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[25:41.710 --> 25:43.830]  As they say in RU Garbage, it's a tough look.
[25:44.830 --> 25:45.870]  It is a tough look.
[25:48.950 --> 25:50.090]  I was thinking about
[25:50.090 --> 25:52.610]  buying, like, a suit for, uh,
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.530]  for a wedding, and I'm like,
[25:54.570 --> 25:56.370]  oh, maybe I'll do, like, I like this turtleneck
[25:56.370 --> 25:58.210]  look that I had done once before
[25:58.210 --> 25:58.830]  at a friend's wedding.
[25:59.590 --> 26:00.870]  Wow, Geoff, that fell apart.
[26:01.330 --> 26:02.990]  That's okay, this one wilted.
[26:04.910 --> 26:06.210]  But then I was like,
[26:06.270 --> 26:08.490]  oh, it's about to get hot in Austin.
[26:08.630 --> 26:10.210]  I was judging turtleneck wedding
[26:10.210 --> 26:12.390]  by today's weather, and today's weather is not
[26:12.390 --> 26:13.970]  what we have coming up.
[26:15.710 --> 26:16.550]  How you doing, Andrew?
[26:18.670 --> 26:19.270]  Kill it.
[26:19.870 --> 26:20.390]  Got it!
[26:20.950 --> 26:21.390]  Wow!
[26:22.570 --> 26:23.430]  Purple piss.
[26:23.430 --> 26:23.750]  Nice.
[26:25.810 --> 26:26.670]  Tiny little house.
[26:26.870 --> 26:27.770]  Little house at the top.
[26:29.170 --> 26:31.390]  I like, uh, I like a turtleneck under a suit
[26:31.390 --> 26:32.790]  instead of, like, a dress shirt.
[26:32.870 --> 26:33.970]  I think it's, like, a fun look sometimes.
[26:34.470 --> 26:37.510]  I personally, I got no issue with other people wearing turtlenecks,
[26:37.590 --> 26:38.910]  but I think it'll be a cold day in hell
[26:38.910 --> 26:40.170]  before I ever put one on again.
[26:41.010 --> 26:42.090]  Same with the cardigan.
[26:43.510 --> 26:45.350]  Yeah, I can't imagine you with a turtleneck on.
[26:45.850 --> 26:47.250]  It reminds me of when Roger Moore
[26:47.250 --> 26:49.690]  was 59, but was still Bond for some reason,
[26:49.790 --> 26:51.690]  and they had to cover up his neck.
[26:51.690 --> 26:52.630]  Yeah.
[26:54.150 --> 26:55.610]  That's, that's tough.
[27:00.840 --> 27:02.400]  Complete fuck this.
[27:03.540 --> 27:04.180]  Did you?
[27:04.400 --> 27:05.380]  Already. Yep.
[27:05.600 --> 27:07.860]  Me too, I forgot what we were doing.
[27:07.860 --> 27:09.800]  I've given myself no ledges to work with.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.280]  Same. I've gone full moron here.
[27:13.420 --> 27:14.640]  Dude, you and I are morons
[27:14.640 --> 27:15.280]  at the hip.
[27:17.060 --> 27:17.700]  Morons at the hip.
[27:17.700 --> 27:20.480]  Guys, I just got one.
[27:21.500 --> 27:22.640]  I got
[27:23.280 --> 27:23.840]  one.
[27:25.080 --> 27:26.500]  If anyone can beat
[27:26.500 --> 27:28.980]  one, you're gonna be okay.
[27:29.500 --> 27:30.760]  You'll at least get all
[27:30.760 --> 27:32.200]  metal. Wow.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.340]  Who's number three?
[27:34.940 --> 27:36.860]  I am. Oh, look at this.
[27:37.500 --> 27:38.640]  Yeah, he's doing it.
[27:38.780 --> 27:39.880]  Oh, that might be Andrew Dandris.
[27:40.660 --> 27:43.100]  That's the move that did
[27:43.100 --> 27:44.540]  me in. That doesn't matter.
[27:44.820 --> 27:45.940]  I was going the long way.
[27:54.020 --> 27:54.700]  Oh,
[27:55.600 --> 27:56.280]  wow.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.560]  What happens then?
[27:59.900 --> 28:01.120]  Oh, we both get first?
[28:01.500 --> 28:03.160]  That's crazy.
[28:04.220 --> 28:04.900]  Wow.
[28:05.120 --> 28:05.960]  That's pretty cool.
[28:07.140 --> 28:08.500]  Oh, another race.
[28:08.860 --> 28:10.180]  Race easy, though.
[28:10.380 --> 28:11.080]  This is for babies.
[28:12.020 --> 28:13.160]  Oh, baby race.
[28:16.420 --> 28:17.260]  It's a race.
[28:18.080 --> 28:19.140]  Eat that ice.
[28:20.360 --> 28:21.240]  Don't talk to me
[28:21.240 --> 28:21.740]  about Mario.
[28:28.200 --> 28:29.460]  I was doing
[28:30.740 --> 28:31.220]  Enrico
[28:31.220 --> 28:31.660]  Polini.
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.240]  I can't believe
[28:37.240 --> 28:37.980]  you remember the name.
[28:39.280 --> 28:40.700]  I'm a big Ron Atkinson guy.
[28:41.140 --> 28:43.380]  I know you are. I guess I can believe you.
[28:43.820 --> 28:44.900]  You big bean head?
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.680]  I'll have a bit of bean.
[28:47.960 --> 28:48.700]  What do you
[28:48.700 --> 28:50.380]  guys call it? Bean flickers?
[28:50.740 --> 28:51.880]  That's what the Ron Atkinson thing is?
[28:53.340 --> 28:54.400]  Is that what it is?
[28:54.420 --> 28:56.860]  That sounds right. If it's not,
[28:56.920 --> 28:57.940]  I definitely heard the term.
[28:58.420 --> 29:00.820]  I hate myself. I genuinely hate myself.
[29:01.180 --> 29:02.500]  I just fucking suck.
[29:04.640 --> 29:05.760]  Oh, yes.
[29:06.440 --> 29:07.000]  Latched.
[29:10.100 --> 29:12.160]  I latched. There we go.
[29:13.360 --> 29:14.740]  Now I got
[29:14.740 --> 29:16.700]  you in my space.
[29:17.660 --> 29:20.320]  I won't let go of you.
[29:20.340 --> 29:21.260]  Shut up.
[29:21.940 --> 29:23.260]  Shut up.
[29:29.710 --> 29:31.190]  Oh, no!
[29:31.850 --> 29:33.390]  It shackled in my embrace.
[29:34.110 --> 29:34.330]  No!
[29:34.730 --> 29:35.570]  Oh, no.
[29:38.170 --> 29:39.370]  Oh, Geoff.
[29:39.710 --> 29:40.990]  Geoff, Geoff, no!
[29:44.030 --> 29:45.770]  Oh, my God.
[29:46.810 --> 29:47.770]  Are you
[29:47.770 --> 29:49.030]  going to do it, Gavin? No.
[29:50.730 --> 29:51.690]  Maybe. No.
[29:53.370 --> 29:53.850]  This
[29:53.850 --> 29:55.750]  was race? This was the easy
[29:55.750 --> 29:57.390]  race? Oh, my God.
[30:00.970 --> 30:03.330]  That was beat by one brick, I think.
[30:04.070 --> 30:05.370]  Is that game?
[30:05.850 --> 30:06.870]  No. No.
[30:07.530 --> 30:08.170]  He's close, though.
[30:09.430 --> 30:11.290]  Alright, here comes my comeback.
[30:12.710 --> 30:13.750]  Hey, Geoff, did you see the
[30:13.750 --> 30:15.830]  clippers on Twitter wishing the Padres
[30:15.830 --> 30:17.230]  happy opening day yesterday?
[30:18.250 --> 30:19.210]  Did they really?
[30:19.850 --> 30:20.230]  Yeah.
[30:22.670 --> 30:23.710]  They started
[30:23.710 --> 30:25.490]  that G League team. It's in Oceanside in
[30:25.490 --> 30:26.530]  North County, San Diego.
[30:27.170 --> 30:29.150]  I think that's why they did it.
[30:29.270 --> 30:29.950]  That's funny.
[30:31.530 --> 30:33.530]  It's like, I don't know. We're not
[30:33.530 --> 30:35.130]  the Lakers wishing the Dodgers, so
[30:35.550 --> 30:36.530]  we'll just get it on there.
[30:37.050 --> 30:39.690]  Gotta wish somebody a good luck.
[30:40.170 --> 30:41.230]  Yeah, pretty much.
[30:43.750 --> 30:44.530]  Nice, good save.
[30:46.610 --> 30:47.790]  Yeah, that sucks.
[30:47.930 --> 30:49.430]  You suck. That was stupid.
[30:49.530 --> 30:50.070]  You're stupid.
[30:53.750 --> 30:55.630]  Is this gonna topple me? Is this
[30:55.630 --> 30:56.930]  idiotic? Am I an idiot?
[30:57.610 --> 30:57.990]  Yes.
[31:01.210 --> 31:02.910]  There you go, idiot.
[31:04.670 --> 31:06.090]  I shouldn't do that.
[31:07.890 --> 31:08.990]  Oh, just under.
[31:09.230 --> 31:10.210]  Oh, just under.
[31:10.210 --> 31:11.350]  Oh, just under.
[31:12.090 --> 31:14.650]  I gotta be happy. I have to be
[31:14.650 --> 31:16.130]  happy with this. I think I'm gonna
[31:16.130 --> 31:17.130]  lose to Gavin, but
[31:17.770 --> 31:18.850]  feel good about it.
[31:20.050 --> 31:20.530]  I'm...
[31:21.830 --> 31:22.790]  an idiot?
[31:25.190 --> 31:32.050]  Oh, this is gonna toss me,
[31:32.230 --> 31:32.530]  I think.
[31:33.990 --> 31:35.830]  Just go down gentle, gentle, gentle.
[31:36.630 --> 31:38.070]  There you go. Gentle.
[31:39.490 --> 31:40.490]  You worked out
[31:40.490 --> 31:41.670]  left and right really well, Gavin.
[31:43.370 --> 31:43.970]  Uh...
[31:43.970 --> 31:45.650]  Damn it. Oh, no!
[31:46.830 --> 31:48.070]  Oh, Gavin.
[31:48.830 --> 31:50.150]  Binned at the end.
[31:50.490 --> 31:51.850]  Schmuckle. Yeah, he had it.
[31:51.990 --> 31:53.270]  Turbo schmuckage.
[31:55.390 --> 31:55.910]  No!
[31:55.910 --> 31:58.290]  What's wrong? Even with your biffing.
[31:59.010 --> 31:59.270]  Yeah.
[32:00.170 --> 32:01.290]  Biff to victory.
[32:01.930 --> 32:03.270]  I'm gonna be just short.
[32:03.890 --> 32:04.290]  Bummer.
[32:05.110 --> 32:06.550]  Man, I went from first to worst.
[32:06.610 --> 32:08.270]  Well, everyone's won but me,
[32:08.370 --> 32:10.350]  so clearly this is my round. I got
[32:10.350 --> 32:11.630]  this. Way to go.
[32:11.850 --> 32:12.550]  Did Eric win?
[32:13.570 --> 32:16.270]  No. We gotta play Ultimate Chicken Horse until
[32:16.270 --> 32:16.830]  Eric loses.
[32:17.630 --> 32:19.590]  So that's the two G's with a win.
[32:20.610 --> 32:20.870]  Yeah.
[32:22.130 --> 32:23.430]  Should we go again? Let's keep it going, boys.
[32:23.690 --> 32:24.490]  Keep it going!
[32:25.990 --> 32:28.270]  Get the corn cats in the chat. Corn cats only.
[32:28.550 --> 32:29.830]  We're corn cat guys today, guys.
[32:29.970 --> 32:31.230]  Let's corn cat this. Come on, baby.
[32:31.230 --> 32:32.450]  Guys, guys, guys.
[32:32.650 --> 32:34.510]  No! I hate this!
[32:35.290 --> 32:36.590]  No, you like it.
[32:36.690 --> 32:39.150]  I hate it because I look at you
[32:39.150 --> 32:40.030]  and I'm 50.
[32:40.750 --> 32:43.350]  I look at you. I see you.
[32:43.630 --> 32:45.270]  Who are you looking at?
[32:45.690 --> 32:47.170]  I'm looking at Eric and he's always got
[32:47.170 --> 32:48.530]  a giant tower of shit.
[32:49.170 --> 32:50.210]  Why would you look at Eric?
[32:51.190 --> 32:53.110]  Because it's like, oh, you know, I think I'm doing
[32:53.110 --> 32:54.950]  pretty okay and then I look at Eric and I go,
[32:55.150 --> 32:55.850]  ah, fuck.
[32:56.410 --> 32:57.950]  I'm not doing good at all.
[32:58.650 --> 32:59.550]  Worry about
[33:00.190 --> 33:00.710]  yourself.
[33:02.190 --> 33:03.910]  If anything, I worry too much
[33:03.910 --> 33:04.610]  about myself. No!
[33:05.930 --> 33:08.250]  Gavin would be a
[33:08.250 --> 33:09.890]  great tough love motivational
[33:09.890 --> 33:11.370]  speaker. Oh, yeah.
[33:13.870 --> 33:14.810]  It's yourself.
[33:17.890 --> 33:19.790]  I'm so mad I screwed up that swear.
[33:19.790 --> 33:21.030]  Tease it. Tease it in.
[33:21.030 --> 33:22.910]  I don't know about this.
[33:24.890 --> 33:25.690]  Tease it!
[33:25.690 --> 33:27.270]  We're gonna try it.
[33:27.750 --> 33:29.350]  Wow, can't believe it worked, boys.
[33:29.370 --> 33:31.910]  Let's see if this is a thing that'll do.
[33:32.690 --> 33:33.370]  Does it do?
[33:33.530 --> 33:35.050]  It does. Does it do?
[33:35.510 --> 33:36.270]  It does do.
[33:36.930 --> 33:37.610]  It does.
[33:37.970 --> 33:41.550]  Hope everyone liked Does It Do?
[33:41.650 --> 33:43.770]  It's never coming back, so thank you so
[33:43.770 --> 33:45.370]  much for checking it out while it was around.
[33:45.550 --> 33:47.570]  But yes, Break Show will come back.
[33:48.050 --> 33:49.050]  Those are the questions.
[33:49.750 --> 33:50.750]  The three questions are
[33:52.130 --> 33:53.550]  Is Does It Do coming back?
[33:53.550 --> 33:55.150]  Is the Break Show coming back?
[33:55.310 --> 33:57.430]  And when is the next season of Good Morning Gustavo?
[33:58.510 --> 33:58.870]  Oh.
[33:59.330 --> 34:01.550]  Those are the questions I get constantly. And I don't know the answer to the
[34:01.550 --> 34:01.790]  Gus one.
[34:03.030 --> 34:05.730]  That should be in the next month or so
[34:05.730 --> 34:07.530]  for the Gus one. Oh, wow. That's way faster
[34:07.530 --> 34:08.510]  than I thought.
[34:09.410 --> 34:11.070]  Richard's already working on it.
[34:12.830 --> 34:13.550]  That should
[34:13.550 --> 34:15.490]  be a pretty low lift at it since he knows it so
[34:15.490 --> 34:15.830]  well now.
[34:16.830 --> 34:19.450]  I just have to make sure that his time can work out for it.
[34:19.710 --> 34:21.270]  Oh, Andrew, what a play!
[34:22.090 --> 34:23.550]  Andrew, you might just have to be okay with it.
[34:23.610 --> 34:24.670]  Andrew, don't.
[34:25.490 --> 34:26.450]  This is fucked.
[34:27.830 --> 34:29.010]  No, it's too tall.
[34:29.090 --> 34:29.750]  It's too big.
[34:30.330 --> 34:30.950]  Pump it!
[34:33.030 --> 34:34.390]  You wanted it too bad.
[34:34.830 --> 34:36.370]  Can I get this in here?
[34:36.630 --> 34:38.130]  You can certainly try.
[34:39.090 --> 34:39.930]  Oh, Gavin!
[34:40.730 --> 34:41.790]  What a play!
[34:42.130 --> 34:44.490]  That might be the move of the year, bud.
[34:45.090 --> 34:45.650]  I'm done.
[34:47.690 --> 34:48.970]  Oh, Geoff's done too.
[34:51.270 --> 34:52.550]  Come on.
[34:52.830 --> 34:53.810]  That's gotta be mine.
[34:54.030 --> 34:54.930]  That's gotta be mine.
[34:55.130 --> 34:55.890]  Come on.
[34:58.350 --> 35:00.130]  We hate the Gavin.
[35:00.970 --> 35:01.270]  Whoa.
[35:01.890 --> 35:02.690]  Holy shit.
[35:04.110 --> 35:04.970]  Damn it.
[35:05.750 --> 35:06.410]  Damn it.
[35:07.610 --> 35:08.930]  Crunchypoos just subscribed.
[35:09.090 --> 35:10.290]  Thanks, Crunchypoos. Great
[35:10.970 --> 35:12.470]  six months of subscribing.
[35:12.870 --> 35:15.590]  You can name yourself anything on this website.
[35:16.270 --> 35:16.730]  That's phenomenal.
[35:17.350 --> 35:17.830]  Yeah.
[35:21.900 --> 35:22.840]  Why did I do that?
[35:23.340 --> 35:24.120]  I don't like this level.
[35:24.260 --> 35:25.040]  What was that about?
[35:27.660 --> 35:29.280]  What was that about?
[35:29.520 --> 35:30.560]  It's your own move.
[35:30.620 --> 35:31.380]  Look at my tower.
[35:31.780 --> 35:32.660]  What was that about?
[35:33.120 --> 35:35.680]  I was looking at your tower, you idiot.
[35:36.020 --> 35:37.200]  It's all going wrong.
[35:40.260 --> 35:42.120]  I got real dumb there for a second.
[35:42.120 --> 35:43.680]  Boom.
[35:45.040 --> 35:46.080]  Uh-oh.
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.280]  I'm in so much trouble.
[35:49.060 --> 35:49.660]  Uh-oh.
[35:52.940 --> 35:54.040]  We're okay.
[35:54.240 --> 35:54.680]  We're okay.
[35:55.900 --> 35:56.780]  Get it in.
[35:57.120 --> 35:59.320]  Simple, easy.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.420]  We're okay.
[36:01.200 --> 36:01.680]  We're okay.
[36:07.660 --> 36:09.340]  I suck.
[36:13.100 --> 36:13.900]  I'm amazing.
[36:14.940 --> 36:16.660]  Dumb shit I do sometimes.
[36:17.380 --> 36:17.740]  No!
[36:20.360 --> 36:20.840]  Fall.
[36:21.640 --> 36:23.900]  Fall, you idiot with your dumb moves.
[36:24.160 --> 36:24.560]  Fall.
[36:25.100 --> 36:25.860]  You're terrible.
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.180]  I think if you're an idiot, though,
[36:29.240 --> 36:31.300]  it's nice to be surprised at how much
[36:31.300 --> 36:32.980]  of an idiot you can be.
[36:33.340 --> 36:34.480]  How did you get that?
[36:34.740 --> 36:36.320]  How the fuck did you get that?
[36:37.280 --> 36:37.680]  Wow.
[36:39.760 --> 36:40.500]  That was real dumb.
[36:40.780 --> 36:41.460]  Master Anchovy with a subscription.
[36:41.700 --> 36:42.740]  Thank you, Master Anchovy.
[36:44.880 --> 36:46.320]  What are your thoughts on anchovies?
[36:47.080 --> 36:47.540]  Not a fan.
[36:49.160 --> 36:51.020]  I don't like them as a whole thing,
[36:51.120 --> 36:52.420]  but when they're all creamed up
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.780]  and everything, I don't really mind them.
[36:54.100 --> 36:54.500]  Cream?
[36:55.600 --> 36:57.520]  Like when you have a Caesar salad or something.
[37:00.640 --> 37:02.320]  You seem confused about that.
[37:02.600 --> 37:04.600]  That's typically where I see anchovies.
[37:04.600 --> 37:05.800]  In cream?
[37:07.220 --> 37:07.760]  Caesar salad.
[37:08.700 --> 37:09.660]  What the fuck?
[37:11.160 --> 37:13.100]  See, anchovies are in Caesar dressing.
[37:13.860 --> 37:15.000]  Geoff, where the fuck
[37:15.000 --> 37:15.820]  do you find this guy?
[37:16.260 --> 37:17.140]  On the internet.
[37:20.300 --> 37:20.780]  Honestly,
[37:21.020 --> 37:21.920]  in a chat room.
[37:29.580 --> 37:30.740]  I like that you can go
[37:30.740 --> 37:32.480]  from working with someone at multiple companies
[37:32.480 --> 37:33.700]  to this guy.
[37:35.280 --> 37:36.600]  In a couple of sentences.
[37:38.020 --> 37:40.500]  I think that has more to do with you than him, though.
[37:40.760 --> 37:41.100]  No!
[37:41.620 --> 37:42.020]  No!
[37:43.840 --> 37:45.380]  I gotta be okay with it.
[37:45.720 --> 37:47.520]  Sorry, Corncats, that was a bad move by me.
[37:47.640 --> 37:49.660]  GDuff, thank you for the subs. Appreciate you.
[37:54.660 --> 37:55.820]  Gavin is stacking.
[37:56.200 --> 37:57.280]  Oh, but that might be it for Gavin.
[37:58.720 --> 37:59.120]  Yeah.
[37:59.120 --> 37:59.360]  Yeah.
[38:00.760 --> 38:02.160]  We're gonna be neck and neck, though, bud.
[38:04.360 --> 38:05.480]  Geoff might take it, though.
[38:05.980 --> 38:07.280]  Hey, come on. Calm down.
[38:08.380 --> 38:09.200]  You got space.
[38:09.260 --> 38:10.080]  You got time. You can do it.
[38:10.100 --> 38:12.060]  I've also got me in my corner.
[38:13.620 --> 38:15.120]  You got it right here. You're good. Walk it in.
[38:15.440 --> 38:17.360]  Did you call out all those GDuff subs?
[38:17.920 --> 38:19.280]  I did. I did say GDuff.
[38:19.300 --> 38:19.700]  Thank you.
[38:20.560 --> 38:22.180]  And then Arcee Stungus again.
[38:23.640 --> 38:24.720]  Geoff! Good job!
[38:25.540 --> 38:27.560]  Oh, Geoff, I don't know.
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.780]  This is where it ends.
[38:30.100 --> 38:30.540]  Yeah.
[38:31.520 --> 38:32.260]  Not bad.
[38:32.580 --> 38:33.920]  Wow, that was really good.
[38:37.440 --> 38:38.320]  Yes! No!
[38:41.720 --> 38:44.740]  Oh, oh, oh.
[38:45.120 --> 38:46.900]  Aluminum Siding, that's a great username,
[38:47.300 --> 38:49.540]  asked, Eric, are the Padres going to be good this year?
[38:50.460 --> 38:51.320]  Yeah, I think they'll
[38:51.320 --> 38:53.180]  probably win the wild card.
[38:53.600 --> 38:55.000]  I mean, they're not gonna win their division.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.940]  But I think they'll probably win the wild card.
[39:01.020 --> 39:02.860]  I think that's the expectation we have to have.
[39:03.040 --> 39:03.360]  Yeah.
[39:06.220 --> 39:07.380]  You gotta have that expectation.
[39:08.340 --> 39:09.180]  You gotta go out there
[39:09.180 --> 39:11.600]  and try to win 100 games, because the Dodgers are gonna win 108.
[39:12.140 --> 39:13.100]  Yeah, you gotta go out there
[39:13.100 --> 39:15.060]  and you gotta give 100%, 100% of the time.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.760]  You just gotta put it all out there on the field.
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.720]  You know, it's not about
[39:19.760 --> 39:20.960]  just one player out there, you know?
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.280]  We got nine guys, and
[39:23.080 --> 39:24.500]  it's about everyone fielding their
[39:24.500 --> 39:26.400]  it's about fielding their position.
[39:26.620 --> 39:28.400]  Everyone kind of doing what they're paid to do.
[39:28.560 --> 39:29.620]  Everyone doing what they do best.
[39:29.960 --> 39:31.140]  Trusting the guys behind you.
[39:31.820 --> 39:32.680]  And trying to make the outs.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.120]  It's all you can do sometimes.
[39:35.380 --> 39:37.860]  It'd be a lot of fun to do a coaches cliches draft.
[39:38.700 --> 39:39.360]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[39:40.780 --> 39:42.240]  Someone stole my shit!
[39:42.360 --> 39:43.140]  What happened there?
[39:46.690 --> 39:48.270]  Well, I think we have a fucking
[39:48.990 --> 39:50.150]  draft slot opening
[39:50.150 --> 39:52.170]  now that we're never gonna do the...
[39:52.170 --> 39:53.610]  Well, we can't do that one!
[39:53.610 --> 39:55.070]  It's cursed!
[39:55.470 --> 39:57.070]  Maybe it has to be spontaneous.
[39:57.910 --> 39:59.470]  I just don't think, man.
[39:59.670 --> 40:01.050]  I'm too worried about it.
[40:01.050 --> 40:03.010]  Maybe it has to be the first
[40:03.630 --> 40:04.670]  predetermined blindside.
[40:05.790 --> 40:07.790]  The only blindside draft.
[40:12.040 --> 40:12.560]  Dammit!
[40:14.600 --> 40:15.540]  I was trying to stay alive.
[40:15.640 --> 40:16.560]  Couldn't make it happen.
[40:21.220 --> 40:22.560]  What's the plot of this game?
[40:25.660 --> 40:26.660]  There's a plot?
[40:26.660 --> 40:28.760]  Pigeon Studios visited a
[40:28.760 --> 40:30.680]  bar in Shoreditch after work this week.
[40:30.740 --> 40:32.060]  It was very fun. That's awesome, man.
[40:32.360 --> 40:33.460]  How you doing, Pete?
[40:34.820 --> 40:36.120]  We were talking about Shoreditch
[40:36.660 --> 40:37.720]  on stream a little while ago.
[40:39.200 --> 40:40.640]  Pete and Jen from
[40:40.640 --> 40:42.460]  Pigeon Studios are awesome. They did the
[40:42.460 --> 40:43.980]  100% Eat theme song.
[40:45.400 --> 40:46.640]  And it's so good.
[40:46.920 --> 40:48.500]  They're so awesome. They're so good.
[40:48.880 --> 40:50.560]  Not gonna hold that
[40:50.560 --> 40:51.260]  against them, though.
[40:52.920 --> 40:54.020]  As good as what?
[40:54.020 --> 40:54.300]  What?
[40:54.600 --> 40:57.040]  I forgot what the game type is again.
[40:58.360 --> 40:59.700]  You got too worried.
[40:59.780 --> 41:00.600]  You got lost in the plot.
[41:01.460 --> 41:02.860]  I was bloody out in the grapes.
[41:03.800 --> 41:05.440]  You can't be out in the grapes.
[41:05.960 --> 41:08.120]  Nobody's out in the grapes anymore,
[41:08.200 --> 41:08.400]  Gavin.
[41:09.880 --> 41:12.220]  That's the deadest of references.
[41:12.700 --> 41:13.300]  I love it, though.
[41:15.300 --> 41:16.180]  You ever soda stream
[41:16.180 --> 41:16.660]  your grapes?
[41:19.000 --> 41:19.740]  I only
[41:19.740 --> 41:22.000]  soda stream approved
[41:23.560 --> 41:23.960]  liquids.
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.540]  Apparently you can carbonate grapes.
[41:27.980 --> 41:30.120]  You can just carbonate regular grapes?
[41:30.120 --> 41:31.960]  Yeah, you just throw them in your canister
[41:31.960 --> 41:33.160]  and you can carbonate them.
[41:33.500 --> 41:34.640]  That doesn't sound right at all.
[41:35.680 --> 41:36.980]  Definitely doesn't sound right.
[41:38.220 --> 41:39.680]  You might just have to be okay with this, Andrew.
[41:42.280 --> 41:43.820]  Oh, what a move.
[41:44.440 --> 41:46.160]  You have so much space now, too.
[41:46.360 --> 41:47.300]  Holy shit.
[41:51.580 --> 41:52.200]  Lock it in.
[41:52.760 --> 41:54.020]  That'll be just under, won't it?
[41:55.740 --> 41:56.700]  You got it.
[41:56.720 --> 41:59.380]  Don't get greedy.
[41:59.940 --> 42:01.200]  Just be fine with it.
[42:02.060 --> 42:03.740]  Just gotta come to terms with it.
[42:04.020 --> 42:05.020]  I think Gavin won.
[42:06.260 --> 42:07.780]  I think Geoff might take it.
[42:08.760 --> 42:09.940]  It's either you or Geoff.
[42:10.000 --> 42:10.920]  I think Geoff might take it.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.200]  I got the doggest shit.
[42:13.680 --> 42:15.480]  You got the doggest shit?
[42:16.060 --> 42:17.240]  I got the doggest shit.
[42:17.320 --> 42:18.360]  Look at my shit, it's so dog.
[42:19.020 --> 42:19.740]  It's seven.
[42:20.200 --> 42:20.560]  Seven!
[42:21.720 --> 42:22.440]  Oh, twelve!
[42:23.940 --> 42:24.980]  I thought that was a tie, damn.
[42:25.780 --> 42:27.720]  It tells you when it's a tie, it says draw.
[42:28.300 --> 42:29.820]  Really coming on strong in these last few.
[42:31.360 --> 42:32.540]  Yeah, what a run at first.
[42:32.920 --> 42:33.760]  What the fuck?
[42:35.240 --> 42:36.540]  Oh no, it's survival easy.
[42:36.740 --> 42:38.080]  I'll fuck this up for sure.
[42:40.100 --> 42:41.660]  You only need a third place, though, right?
[42:42.720 --> 42:43.420]  Oh, that's a good point.
[42:44.140 --> 42:46.720]  It's gonna have to be a real hard Geoffin'.
[42:48.360 --> 42:48.680]  Haha.
[42:52.720 --> 42:53.120]  Nope!
[42:57.020 --> 42:59.540]  God, I just get completely flummoxed
[42:59.540 --> 43:00.460]  by some shapes.
[43:01.260 --> 43:02.100]  Oh, that happens.
[43:04.880 --> 43:06.200]  Oh, this is so bad.
[43:07.200 --> 43:07.500]  Okay.
[43:08.440 --> 43:10.500]  Gavin, what do you think is a band that you like
[43:10.500 --> 43:11.680]  that a lot of other people don't like?
[43:14.400 --> 43:14.800]  Uh...
[43:15.360 --> 43:16.280]  Do you have a band like that?
[43:16.400 --> 43:17.200]  Do people like Foreigner?
[43:18.040 --> 43:18.520]  Yes.
[43:18.680 --> 43:19.400]  I like Foreigner.
[43:20.300 --> 43:20.780]  Uh...
[43:24.220 --> 43:25.080]  The Darkness?
[43:26.240 --> 43:27.200]  Oh, really?
[43:28.980 --> 43:30.240]  The Darkness is a good answer.
[43:30.800 --> 43:31.180]  Great band.
[43:34.620 --> 43:35.800]  They had the one hit.
[43:36.260 --> 43:37.800]  That whole album was awesome.
[43:38.540 --> 43:39.160]  Was it?
[43:39.180 --> 43:42.960]  Yeah, dude, if you never listened to it, that entire album was just as good as that song.
[43:43.480 --> 43:44.580]  Never listened to it.
[43:45.300 --> 43:45.660]  What's that?
[43:47.000 --> 43:47.600]  Uh, yes.
[43:47.740 --> 43:48.240]  Permission granted.
[43:48.860 --> 43:49.260]  No!
[43:55.160 --> 43:56.360]  I should listen to that album.
[43:56.720 --> 43:57.720]  Yeah, it was really good.
[44:00.280 --> 44:02.180]  Why didn't they make more?
[44:03.420 --> 44:04.520]  I think they were a band
[44:04.520 --> 44:05.560]  for like longer, weren't they?
[44:06.400 --> 44:07.280]  Didn't they like keep going?
[44:07.600 --> 44:07.740]  Who?
[44:09.640 --> 44:10.780]  Are you okay?
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.080]  Oh, no. Daddy's out.
[44:17.660 --> 44:18.820]  I need a power up.
[44:18.860 --> 44:19.660]  I need to lock this in.
[44:20.480 --> 44:21.360]  What was that?
[44:22.320 --> 44:23.540]  What was that?
[44:23.740 --> 44:24.580]  What happened?
[44:25.480 --> 44:27.380]  I think Geoff just took it.
[44:30.000 --> 44:31.720]  I mean, as long as he wasn't last.
[44:32.860 --> 44:34.260]  That's going to give us just enough time
[44:34.260 --> 44:35.400]  to do one more round.
[44:36.000 --> 44:36.540]  It's true.
[44:36.880 --> 44:37.780]  Who needs to win still?
[44:38.260 --> 44:38.580]  Me.
[44:41.200 --> 44:42.900]  I haven't won yet.
[44:42.900 --> 44:44.020]  Oh, really? I thought you won.
[44:44.200 --> 44:45.560]  I have not won yet.
[44:46.380 --> 44:49.480]  Oh, you went into overtime with Geoff.
[44:49.580 --> 44:50.020]  That's what happened.
[44:50.440 --> 44:52.420]  Although, if I win, it'll be 2-2, right?
[44:52.480 --> 44:53.560]  And then we'll have to have a decider.
[44:54.360 --> 44:55.080]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[44:55.260 --> 44:56.140]  Well, there you go. That's interesting.
[44:56.620 --> 44:57.560]  I guess that would be the wrinkle.
[44:59.360 --> 45:01.120]  Hopefully this answers the 501.
[45:02.120 --> 45:03.120]  Hope everyone's doing okay.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.460]  I am, thanks. Thanks for watching.
[45:06.540 --> 45:07.480]  I hope you're doing okay, Eric.
[45:08.560 --> 45:11.000]  I'm doing fine. The allergies are killing me today.
[45:12.240 --> 45:13.180]  Had a lot of Eric
[45:13.180 --> 45:14.000]  in my life today.
[45:15.080 --> 45:16.080]  This week, man.
[45:17.660 --> 45:18.760]  Too much, would you say?
[45:19.260 --> 45:20.080]  No, not at all.
[45:20.700 --> 45:22.340]  I mean, yes, I guess so.
[45:24.220 --> 45:25.800]  Yes, Eric and I
[45:25.800 --> 45:27.040]  feel very differently about each other.
[45:28.340 --> 45:29.480]  Oh, where am I
[45:29.480 --> 45:29.980]  going to put that?
[45:30.700 --> 45:32.800]  I had a good amount of Geoff. I had a bad amount of Eric.
[45:36.480 --> 45:36.840]  Eh!
[45:38.240 --> 45:38.860]  Oh, God.
[45:39.540 --> 45:40.180]  What was that?
[45:40.180 --> 45:42.160]  I mean...
[45:42.160 --> 45:43.460]  Oh, how did that not? Okay, there we go.
[45:43.680 --> 45:45.500]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[45:45.580 --> 45:47.580]  I'm a fucking blind fool.
[45:47.980 --> 45:48.900]  Why so fast?
[45:49.400 --> 45:50.400]  It's fast!
[45:53.980 --> 45:55.020]  Too fast.
[45:55.600 --> 45:56.660]  Way too fast.
[45:58.580 --> 45:59.540]  Oh, cool.
[46:00.720 --> 46:02.020]  Oh, cool!
[46:02.700 --> 46:03.480]  That sucked!
[46:04.440 --> 46:05.220]  Didn't need that.
[46:07.600 --> 46:09.780]  Andrew's just sliding down that slide.
[46:09.780 --> 46:11.780]  Oh, no. Slippery.
[46:12.340 --> 46:13.520]  Oh, no!
[46:14.600 --> 46:15.200]  How do you get such
[46:15.820 --> 46:16.860]  precise ice?
[46:18.400 --> 46:19.780]  How did that
[46:19.780 --> 46:21.840]  happen? How did that happen?
[46:22.100 --> 46:23.080]  It looks like somebody hit a home run.
[46:23.280 --> 46:24.100]  That was crazy.
[46:25.960 --> 46:27.420]  It's always dumb.
[46:27.520 --> 46:28.220]  It's always so quirky.
[46:30.020 --> 46:31.520]  Well, that's the start Eric and I needed.
[46:32.640 --> 46:34.020]  Man, that is bad.
[46:35.120 --> 46:35.920]  Oh, this one,
[46:36.300 --> 46:36.580]  motherfucker.
[46:36.580 --> 46:38.400]  Okay, remember
[46:38.400 --> 46:39.680]  which game type it is.
[46:40.100 --> 46:42.260]  Remember the game type. Remember
[46:42.260 --> 46:44.060]  the game type.
[46:44.760 --> 46:46.300]  Do you remember?
[46:51.460 --> 46:52.200]  Whammo!
[46:56.310 --> 46:57.420]  Got it.
[46:58.940 --> 46:59.680]  What?
[46:59.980 --> 47:01.660]  Is this gonna work this way?
[47:01.700 --> 47:03.360]  Is this gonna work this way?
[47:04.460 --> 47:05.020]  Nope.
[47:06.020 --> 47:07.240]  It worked that way.
[47:11.720 --> 47:12.280]  Great.
[47:13.860 --> 47:15.320]  A little flat land here.
[47:15.600 --> 47:16.600]  It'd be cool if I
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.020]  did anything.
[47:24.270 --> 47:25.050]  Bury it.
[47:29.030 --> 47:30.030]  Alright, I'm gonna have to
[47:30.030 --> 47:31.330]  double tap this in somehow.
[47:32.270 --> 47:34.230]  Here's the double tap. Here come the double tap.
[47:34.810 --> 47:35.530]  Gonna double-double.
[47:38.590 --> 47:39.390]  Idiot, you
[47:40.610 --> 47:41.410]  shitting stupid
[47:41.410 --> 47:42.010]  idiot.
[47:45.990 --> 47:46.390]  Okay.
[47:48.490 --> 47:49.130]  There you go.
[47:50.690 --> 47:51.650]  Way to not embarrass
[47:51.650 --> 47:51.990]  yourself.
[47:53.290 --> 47:54.730]  Okay, I think I just gotta put it here.
[47:55.210 --> 47:57.290]  Gotta put this one here.
[47:58.830 --> 47:59.730]  Think I'll be okay.
[48:02.630 --> 48:03.690]  Yeah, let's just be fine
[48:03.690 --> 48:04.950]  with it. Let's just be fine with it.
[48:04.950 --> 48:06.150]  Let's feel good about that.
[48:06.210 --> 48:08.330]  We're doing okay. We're okay.
[48:08.470 --> 48:09.970]  We're locked in, boys. We're locked in.
[48:13.150 --> 48:15.230]  Great move, Andrew. You have a lot you can build on there.
[48:19.840 --> 48:20.200]  Oops.
[48:21.360 --> 48:23.040]  You went a little early there, bud.
[48:23.660 --> 48:24.400]  Oh my god.
[48:26.360 --> 48:27.520]  Andrew, what a move.
[48:30.800 --> 48:32.120]  Andrew's so locked in right now.
[48:32.220 --> 48:33.140]  I'm trying.
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.240]  There it goes.
[48:35.380 --> 48:36.640]  There goes Gavin.
[48:37.200 --> 48:39.900]  Right in the green hole.
[48:40.560 --> 48:43.400]  What a move, Andrew. What a move.
[48:43.660 --> 48:44.220]  Beautiful.
[48:45.700 --> 48:46.820]  Beautiful, Andrew.
[48:47.540 --> 48:48.760]  You can put that under.
[48:49.280 --> 48:50.520]  Beautiful move.
[48:50.700 --> 48:52.700]  Yeah, you could have slotted that in.
[48:54.220 --> 48:54.560]  Wow.
[48:54.660 --> 48:55.320]  I was too scared.
[48:56.380 --> 48:58.080]  I just killed mine doing that.
[49:00.120 --> 49:00.520]  No.
[49:00.820 --> 49:02.480]  Ooh, daddy wins.
[49:02.740 --> 49:04.500]  Once again, Eric and I, for a second, I'm okay with this.
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.400]  One of us needs to win.
[49:06.300 --> 49:07.380]  Feel good about it.
[49:09.340 --> 49:10.860]  Looking bad for the Gs.
[49:11.320 --> 49:12.040]  Locked in.
[49:12.140 --> 49:13.040]  Scraping up the back end.
[49:16.520 --> 49:17.320]  Survival normal.
[49:19.000 --> 49:20.320]  It's fun that it's Friday.
[49:21.380 --> 49:21.620]  Yeah.
[49:21.620 --> 49:23.220]  I'm so happy it's fucking Friday.
[49:24.180 --> 49:26.840]  There's no wrestling this weekend, so I don't have anything this weekend.
[49:26.840 --> 49:28.040]  I'm so fucking excited.
[49:28.700 --> 49:34.300]  I have not had a weekend off in I don't know how long.
[49:34.800 --> 49:38.660]  Next week, there are three wrestling shows in two days that I am doing.
[49:39.240 --> 49:40.880]  Are they all in Austin, at least?
[49:41.440 --> 49:41.940]  They are.
[49:42.340 --> 49:45.160]  One's at Pinballs, at Lake Creek.
[49:45.340 --> 49:48.240]  One's at AAPW, which is like North Austin.
[49:48.400 --> 49:50.440]  And then the other one's at Empire Control Room.
[49:51.540 --> 49:52.960]  Is that a touring one?
[49:54.340 --> 49:55.460]  Yeah, kind of.
[49:55.460 --> 49:58.440]  The one that I just went out to on Sunday last week, New Texas Pro.
[49:59.420 --> 50:01.140]  They're coming back here to Austin.
[50:01.300 --> 50:03.740]  They tour pretty well.
[50:03.820 --> 50:04.580]  They've been doing really well.
[50:04.700 --> 50:06.220]  Oh, you thieving prick.
[50:07.180 --> 50:09.400]  I do the pre-show that goes on their YouTube channel.
[50:09.720 --> 50:10.500]  It's been really good.
[50:11.620 --> 50:12.840]  April 6th, check it out.
[50:12.900 --> 50:14.200]  New Texas Pro Wrestling YouTube channel.
[50:14.340 --> 50:18.980]  Did a little group of top-hatted ghosts come and steal my thing?
[50:19.220 --> 50:19.440]  Yes.
[50:19.620 --> 50:22.040]  I got my little ghosts in there to help you.
[50:24.080 --> 50:25.380]  Did they help you?
[50:25.640 --> 50:25.880]  No.
[50:26.520 --> 50:27.680]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[50:29.900 --> 50:31.240]  Geoff, 100%, that's on me.
[50:31.260 --> 50:31.700]  Is that on you?
[50:32.420 --> 50:33.360]  Yeah, that's on me, bro.
[50:33.440 --> 50:35.140]  Maybe I have had too much Eric this week.
[50:36.640 --> 50:38.780]  That's all I'm saying.
[50:39.680 --> 50:40.620]  I get it.
[50:41.500 --> 50:42.480]  I get it.
[50:42.700 --> 50:43.600]  My wife gets it.
[50:43.660 --> 50:44.380]  We all get it.
[50:45.280 --> 50:47.040]  Well, for God's sake, though.
[50:47.780 --> 50:48.860]  Yeah, what's up?
[50:49.820 --> 50:50.620]  Fuck me.
[50:53.020 --> 50:53.900]  Constant thieving.
[50:54.800 --> 50:55.700]  Oh, shit.
[50:56.320 --> 50:57.100]  Now I've been fogged.
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.240]  I can't see a damn thing.
[51:00.340 --> 51:00.840]  There we go.
[51:01.460 --> 51:02.720]  I think I got this right here.
[51:03.440 --> 51:05.520]  Oh, no!
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.420]  No, no, no, no!
[51:09.780 --> 51:10.720]  My beautiful tamer!
[51:10.740 --> 51:12.060]  That's unfortunate for me.
[51:12.520 --> 51:14.140]  I blew it, boys. I blew it.
[51:14.380 --> 51:16.660]  I'm sorry, corn cats. I love you. I apologize.
[51:19.280 --> 51:21.320]  I'm sorry, cats.
[51:21.440 --> 51:22.280]  I'm sorry, little corn cats.
[51:22.280 --> 51:23.640]  Eat your corn. I apologize.
[51:25.500 --> 51:26.740]  Good job, Geoff.
[51:27.040 --> 51:27.200]  Damn it.
[51:27.680 --> 51:28.400]  Damn it.
[51:29.500 --> 51:31.060]  That was Andrew's to lose.
[51:31.560 --> 51:33.160]  And I blew it.
[51:36.140 --> 51:37.700]  That's okay. We're climbing.
[51:38.160 --> 51:39.060]  Eric and I are both halfway.
[51:40.580 --> 51:41.580]  Get a first here.
[51:42.820 --> 51:44.080]  Put me in a good position.
[51:46.660 --> 51:47.300]  Feeling good.
[51:47.560 --> 51:48.900]  Look good, feel good, you know what I'm saying?
[51:52.800 --> 51:54.120]  I suppose so.
[51:54.280 --> 51:55.780]  Gotta be patient.
[51:55.860 --> 51:57.320]  Does this lock into the...
[51:57.320 --> 51:57.940]  No!
[52:00.040 --> 52:00.800]  There we go.
[52:01.740 --> 52:03.380]  All across the nation, baby.
[52:03.800 --> 52:05.240]  That's what I'm looking for.
[52:05.520 --> 52:06.900]  Is there a cure for dumb?
[52:08.700 --> 52:09.900]  Eventually, will I be all right?
[52:10.260 --> 52:12.680]  Hey, if there is, we don't have a show.
[52:13.200 --> 52:14.420]  You better hope there's not.
[52:17.740 --> 52:19.460]  Careful what you ask for, dumbass.
[52:19.740 --> 52:20.380]  Yeah, no kidding.
[52:20.640 --> 52:21.020]  Please.
[52:21.920 --> 52:23.780]  This is our livelihood, bud.
[52:27.880 --> 52:36.470]  You know what's not funny?
[52:37.150 --> 52:37.630]  What?
[52:37.830 --> 52:38.330]  Science.
[52:39.710 --> 52:42.050]  You get blinded by it and everything, dude.
[52:43.190 --> 52:45.310]  It's the science that even make it past one season.
[52:46.450 --> 52:48.470]  Is it the upcoming episode where I asked about ribs?
[52:50.330 --> 52:51.850]  Yeah, I think so.
[52:52.730 --> 52:54.790]  Yeah, there's plenty of dumb to come.
[52:55.330 --> 52:56.430]  Yeah, that's a pretty good one.
[52:56.670 --> 52:58.130]  That's legendary stupid.
[52:58.530 --> 53:00.430]  The title is just so good.
[53:00.490 --> 53:01.430]  I'm so happy with it.
[53:01.590 --> 53:04.410]  I was trying to explain it
[53:04.410 --> 53:06.710]  to my wife and she couldn't
[53:06.710 --> 53:07.310]  grasp
[53:08.290 --> 53:10.410]  how it couldn't be grasped.
[53:10.870 --> 53:12.050]  She just couldn't get there.
[53:12.670 --> 53:13.570]  It was pretty cool.
[53:14.450 --> 53:15.010]  Guys,
[53:16.730 --> 53:18.050]  as we were talking,
[53:18.050 --> 53:19.790]  New Texas Pro Wrestling
[53:19.790 --> 53:22.330]  just announced Dimitri Aleksandrov.
[53:22.450 --> 53:23.770]  Whoa, Brick Savage. What?
[53:24.030 --> 53:25.650]  And Rachel Rose? Wow.
[53:25.750 --> 53:26.950]  Against Living in Fashion
[53:26.950 --> 53:29.910]  and Jesse Funaki, who's the son
[53:29.910 --> 53:31.930]  of Smackdown wrestler Funaki.
[53:32.270 --> 53:33.770]  Who can believe this? Gavin?
[53:34.770 --> 53:35.290]  Yeah.
[53:36.150 --> 53:37.150]  Gavin can't believe it.
[53:41.930 --> 53:44.130]  Yeah! Three-way, baby!
[53:46.630 --> 53:47.430]  Let's go.
[53:48.970 --> 53:50.290]  Survival easy. Let's go.
[53:50.870 --> 53:52.270]  Lock in.
[53:56.940 --> 53:58.280]  Next time we stream this,
[53:58.500 --> 54:00.000]  I'm going to employ someone in the audience
[54:00.000 --> 54:00.740]  who's decent.
[54:03.460 --> 54:05.140]  You're going to employ someone?
[54:05.400 --> 54:06.440]  That sounded bad.
[54:07.960 --> 54:09.580]  To already be screaming
[54:09.580 --> 54:10.740]  on the sixth piece
[54:10.740 --> 54:11.920]  is really something, man.
[54:13.620 --> 54:14.700]  Don't talk to me.
[54:17.860 --> 54:19.320]  I'm having an absolute
[54:20.300 --> 54:20.820]  shambles.
[54:23.180 --> 54:32.470]  Oh, this is already so
[54:33.370 --> 54:34.410]  skinny bollocks.
[54:34.930 --> 54:35.550]  Is it?
[54:37.030 --> 54:38.630]  Oh, bad, bad, bad.
[54:41.710 --> 54:42.710]  There we go.
[54:44.730 --> 54:45.690]  Abandon that one.
[54:45.770 --> 54:46.710]  Let's just work on this one.
[54:50.890 --> 54:51.930]  Never mind.
[54:51.930 --> 54:52.110]  Never mind.
[54:53.110 --> 54:54.870]  Not quite sure what I was thinking there.
[54:55.570 --> 54:56.010]  Moron.
[54:56.990 --> 54:58.170]  Oh, you're one of those too?
[54:59.930 --> 55:00.370]  Ah!
[55:06.890 --> 55:08.050]  Lock it in.
[55:09.850 --> 55:10.290]  Nice.
[55:10.570 --> 55:11.110]  Doing okay.
[55:12.650 --> 55:15.010]  I think that's going to be too much. Let's do this one here.
[55:15.910 --> 55:16.570]  Nice and easy.
[55:17.270 --> 55:18.590]  This one should be okay.
[55:19.630 --> 55:21.270]  Nope, too heavy, too heavy, too heavy!
[55:21.590 --> 55:22.170]  Too heavy!
[55:23.270 --> 55:24.190]  Too heavy.
[55:25.570 --> 55:26.530]  Sorry, rats.
[55:27.750 --> 55:28.470]  Welcome to
[55:28.470 --> 55:30.510]  5-0-1. Can Andrew
[55:30.510 --> 55:31.570]  do it? Never mind.
[55:34.030 --> 55:34.430]  Andrew
[55:34.430 --> 55:36.490]  saved his ass.
[55:36.610 --> 55:37.730]  I don't know how you just did that.
[55:38.090 --> 55:39.550]  Andrew, you're falling apart, buddy.
[55:39.950 --> 55:41.090]  Andrew, relax.
[55:42.130 --> 55:43.170]  Andrew, relax!
[55:43.530 --> 55:44.890]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[55:48.960 --> 55:49.320]  No!
[55:49.800 --> 55:51.520]  Great move. Hang on to that.
[55:51.520 --> 55:52.020]  That's your safety.
[55:53.880 --> 55:54.480]  Shit.
[55:55.280 --> 55:57.440]  Oh, he used all of his pieces.
[55:58.120 --> 55:58.200]  Wow.
[55:59.300 --> 56:01.380]  5-0-1.
[56:02.420 --> 56:02.540]  Oh!
[56:03.340 --> 56:04.360]  Look at this.
[56:04.860 --> 56:06.500]  We're both three away.
[56:07.240 --> 56:09.200]  That's going to be a puzzle with those fucking nuts.
[56:09.780 --> 56:10.960]  Ah! Puzzle easy.
[56:11.200 --> 56:12.400]  It's a puzzle easy.
[56:13.560 --> 56:14.600]  Let's do it, boys.
[56:35.330 --> 56:35.810]  But...
[56:35.810 --> 56:36.810]  That's going to be too much.
[56:48.570 --> 56:49.650]  It's going to be okay.
[56:50.010 --> 56:50.230]  Okay.
[56:55.530 --> 56:57.650]  We both seriously shut up.
[56:58.170 --> 56:59.050]  Mm-hmm. Yep.
[57:01.370 --> 57:02.710]  This is locked in, baby.
[57:05.190 --> 57:06.770]  Finally, somebody got us to stop
[57:06.770 --> 57:07.690]  fucking talking.
[57:09.150 --> 57:10.750]  I'm telling you, if there's a cure for dumb,
[57:10.750 --> 57:11.270]  we're fucked.
[57:12.250 --> 57:14.170]  Oh, why did I do that?
[57:15.290 --> 57:16.650]  Oh, guys.
[57:16.650 --> 57:18.750]  I just blew the whole thing.
[57:18.830 --> 57:20.230]  I can't believe it tilted.
[57:21.970 --> 57:22.570]  Ah!
[57:23.390 --> 57:24.870]  Oh, I just got real
[57:24.870 --> 57:26.970]  double digits there.
[57:34.070 --> 57:36.510]  How does Andrew keep winning with these
[57:36.510 --> 57:38.730]  gappies? I don't know.
[57:38.730 --> 57:40.810]  I'm going to go eat pizza
[57:40.810 --> 57:42.190]  and sit quiet in a corner.
[57:42.370 --> 57:43.750]  This sucks.
[57:44.370 --> 57:46.270]  That was such a heartbreaker.
[57:47.110 --> 57:47.250]  Ugh.
[57:49.150 --> 57:49.590]  Ugh.
[57:50.170 --> 57:50.770]  Please work.
[57:52.750 --> 57:54.250]  You can hit X.
[57:54.550 --> 57:56.570]  Oh, you're on there. You're good.
[57:58.990 --> 58:00.350]  Well, I guess this is it.
[58:00.350 --> 58:01.310]  Yeah, this might just be it, huh?
[58:03.610 --> 58:04.050]  Nice.
[58:04.050 --> 58:06.050]  He got
[58:07.690 --> 58:08.170]  three?
[58:09.050 --> 58:09.530]  Three.
[58:10.050 --> 58:12.170]  I had such a good stack.
[58:12.410 --> 58:14.270]  I had such a good stack going left to right
[58:14.270 --> 58:15.290]  and it all...
[58:15.290 --> 58:17.930]  I mean, five or six pieces just went
[58:17.930 --> 58:19.450]  off. It was so bad.
[58:19.930 --> 58:21.010]  Oh, damn.
[58:21.130 --> 58:24.090]  If I get first place in this next one, that's it.
[58:24.170 --> 58:24.570]  I win.
[58:25.250 --> 58:27.610]  That's a race with wind.
[58:27.810 --> 58:28.910]  With all the wind.
[58:29.790 --> 58:31.750]  This is going to be a catastrophe.
[58:34.490 --> 58:35.550]  Feeds on ice.
[58:35.870 --> 58:36.150]  Andrew?
[58:37.130 --> 58:37.650]  Yep.
[58:40.770 --> 58:41.290]  Yep.
[58:42.950 --> 58:44.250]  I just blew it!
[58:44.410 --> 58:44.870]  No! Why?
[58:44.870 --> 58:46.030]  That's it. That's it to me.
[58:47.410 --> 58:49.710]  How did you do... Oh, you're so stupid.
[58:50.610 --> 58:52.150]  I just blew it so
[58:52.150 --> 58:53.770]  bad. I can't believe that happened.
[58:57.150 --> 58:58.070]  And the dumb
[58:58.070 --> 58:58.650]  get dumber.
[59:00.810 --> 59:02.090]  I'm going to throw up. I'm so
[59:02.090 --> 59:02.530]  upset.
[59:08.240 --> 59:09.660]  Give it. Give it. Give it.
[59:10.120 --> 59:11.540]  Oh my god!
[59:11.840 --> 59:13.600]  Oh no. Right as this happens.
[59:13.700 --> 59:16.020]  Well, that was a mistake. 25 gifted
[59:16.020 --> 59:18.080]  subs. No way. Oh my god. Thank you.
[59:18.460 --> 59:19.300]  That's so many.
[59:20.140 --> 59:21.480]  That threw off my game.
[59:21.880 --> 59:23.340]  It threw off my entire game.
[59:23.700 --> 59:24.620]  The anime character.
[59:26.280 --> 59:27.440]  Thank you, Akira.
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.460]  Oh my god. That fucked me.
[59:29.740 --> 59:31.840]  That fucked me. Everything was going so
[59:31.840 --> 59:32.880]  good and then that happened.
[59:34.740 --> 59:35.960]  Thank you for the 25
[59:35.960 --> 59:37.980]  gifted. We couldn't do this without you. We appreciate
[59:37.980 --> 59:39.440]  you so much. You're incredible.
[59:39.940 --> 59:41.960]  That's an insane amount of subs.
[59:42.080 --> 59:42.440]  Thank you.
[59:44.260 --> 59:45.900]  I have moved
[59:45.900 --> 59:47.820]  to a point where I cannot for the
[59:47.820 --> 59:48.800]  life of me build.
[59:50.020 --> 59:51.660]  You guys deal with that.
[59:51.940 --> 59:53.940]  Extra fucked. Mega fucked. How about that?
[59:54.020 --> 59:55.900]  All the way back to the beginning. Yeah, there
[59:55.900 --> 59:57.900]  we go. Let's start over. All of my stuff
[59:57.900 --> 59:58.840]  is slipping off.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.060]  Oh
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.020]  god.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:03.920]  What?
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.860]  That was
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.260]  unfortunate.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.020]  What am I doing?
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.600]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.500]  Stop
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.520]  thieving. What is that?
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.620]  No, you've muffed it.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.700]  Oh, you've got to be
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.740]  kidding me. What happened?
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]  What just happened?
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.400]  It's all gone. Well, that's
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.380]  exceptionally panicky.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.400]  Corn cats, you
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.120]  saw that. You saw it wasn't me.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.400]  Who did that? Akira? Oh, no.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.740]  Oh, the wind.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.980]  Oh, god.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.940]  The wind is fierce.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.220]  I give it back.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.120]  Well, god damn. What the
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.280]  fricking damn
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.880]  son?
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.660]  Okay.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.300]  Is there a way to hook this game up to
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.400]  Twitch chat where they vote
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.520]  or whatever on what pieces we get
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.300]  and all that stuff? Is that a thing in this game?
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:00.420]  That'd be phenomenal. I'm mentally
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.520]  collapsed. What the fuck?
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.220]  Akira with 10 more gifted.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.980]  What the fuck is going on?
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.700]  Thank you so much. This is uneasy.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:09.780]  Generosity!
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.120]  Akira broke me.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.480]  Akira is spending all
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.160]  of their free resources on us. How is it getting worse?
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.460]  I'm back to the beginning.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.240]  Oh, the wind's going to take it.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.100]  Why would I learn about the wind?
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:22.800]  No!
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.940]  I was so structurally sound.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.800]  No! I had it.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:28.580]  No!
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.240]  I was there.
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.200]  Corn cats! Corn cats!
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.980]  Corn cats!
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.080]  Akira, Odie,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.140]  Becca, that's for you.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.080]  Wow.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.440]  What a...
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.340]  We might get overtime. We do have overtime.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.280]  No, no, Geoff wins!
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:56.900]  Geoff wins!
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:04.660]  Oh, man. I'm sorry.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.660]  I'm sorry, Andrew and Eric.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.000]  Don't apologize to me.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400]  Apologize to Odie,
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.600]  Becca, and apologize to Akira right now.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.660]  I'm sorry, Akira.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.440]  All of those free gifted subs
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.040]  were for nothing.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.220]  We don't want to start again. Who hit start?
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.020]  Oh, man.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.340]  Well, guys, thank you so much
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.100]  for watching. Really appreciate
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.180]  everyone tuning in for that. This has been a great
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.680]  stream. This has been a lot of fun.

[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.060]  out on Patreon. Hey,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.140]  did you know we've been playing Mario Party every
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.100]  day in March? That video should be out
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.060]  Sunday? Yeah.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.700]  Does anyone know? It's Sunday, right?
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.340]  Sunday's the 31st?
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:46.540]  Or Monday. Sunday or Monday.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.220]  But you can watch the dailies as they
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:49.980]  come out every daily.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:50.880]  Yeah.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:51.260]  Yeah.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.080]  I just didn't know what the last day of the month was.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.280]  Guys, thanks
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.240]  for watching. Check this out later.
