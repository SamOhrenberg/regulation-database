[00:00.000 --> 00:03.360]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay. We're playing Gryffball.
[00:04.740 --> 00:07.380]  I've never done this. I've never played this.
[00:07.380 --> 00:09.580]  I was curious. Yeah, I figured you wouldn't have played.
[00:10.220 --> 00:11.180]  It's, uh...
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.920]  The only thing... Here's all I know about Gryffball.
[00:13.540 --> 00:18.660]  When you're at Comic-Con and you're next to Rooster Teeth, people buy them endlessly.
[00:19.260 --> 00:21.060]  That's all I know about Gryffball.
[00:21.240 --> 00:25.400]  If there's something else I need to know, please inform me, but that is all I know about Gryffball.
[00:25.620 --> 00:26.460]  That's pretty much it.
[00:27.320 --> 00:29.080]  It's just a vehicle to sell plushies.
[00:29.080 --> 00:32.240]  And it worked. Boy, did it work. Boy, did it fucking work.
[00:33.020 --> 00:35.440]  Jesus Christ. It felt like you guys had buckets.
[00:35.820 --> 00:42.300]  Like, huge boxes of those things, and you would just sell them by the handfuls.
[00:42.580 --> 00:44.040]  They were just crazy.
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.660]  To be fair, a box only holds about six of them because they're so big.
[00:48.620 --> 00:51.720]  They were really big, and man, they are just like...
[00:51.720 --> 00:54.300]  They went like hotcakes when you guys were doing that. That was crazy.
[00:54.920 --> 00:55.520]  Really nuts.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.500]  Which Halo is this?
[00:58.060 --> 00:59.460]  This is Halo Infinite.
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.980]  I don't think I played this one.
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.660]  The newest one.
[01:03.900 --> 01:06.460]  Did you end up playing with Millie in this or no?
[01:06.880 --> 01:10.320]  Yeah, we beat the game together when they finally patched in co-op.
[01:10.680 --> 01:12.640]  Cool. I didn't know if that was a thing or not.
[01:12.800 --> 01:13.820]  It actually was pretty fun.
[01:14.100 --> 01:15.160]  Yeah, we had a blast doing it.
[01:16.180 --> 01:17.340]  I enjoyed the campaign.
[01:17.460 --> 01:21.060]  I just waited about a year and a half after it came out to finally play it.
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.840]  Yeah, the play date, you know?
[01:22.960 --> 01:23.520]  That was hard.
[01:24.020 --> 01:25.820]  You can't play it on the release date. You gotta wait for the play date.
[01:25.820 --> 01:29.880]  You can't play it on the release date if it's not patched to include co-op.
[01:31.020 --> 01:33.620]  And who needs to play in co-op in this game? Stupid.
[01:36.100 --> 01:39.740]  Yesterday, when we determined we were going to play this, I downloaded Infinite.
[01:40.040 --> 01:43.600]  And then I loaded up and I thought I'd play a couple of rounds of Grifball just to get my feet wet again.
[01:43.680 --> 01:45.540]  And I sat in the searching screen until I gave up.
[01:46.220 --> 01:46.940]  No way!
[01:47.700 --> 01:48.640]  Switched over to Roadcraft.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.700]  Really? Because I haven't had any issues with searching.
[01:51.860 --> 01:53.380]  I'll cancel it and I'll pull it back in.
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.980]  Well, at worst, I suppose we could play SWAT or something. Or do they have SWAT anymore?
[01:58.520 --> 02:02.580]  We shouldn't struggle to find games in this because it's estimated wait time of 26 seconds.
[02:03.100 --> 02:04.280]  Yeah, that was longer.
[02:04.800 --> 02:05.880]  That was a little bit longer than that.
[02:05.880 --> 02:07.020]  That was definitely longer.
[02:08.680 --> 02:10.460]  Let's all close the game.
[02:11.080 --> 02:12.080]  And then we load into it.
[02:12.380 --> 02:12.640]  Yeah?
[02:12.960 --> 02:14.000]  Just to make sure.
[02:14.780 --> 02:15.180]  Sure.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.060]  I'm doing that.
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.160]  I think it might have just kicked it. Like, right when we were just going, it looked like it changed screens.
[02:20.460 --> 02:20.960]  But, I don't know.
[02:21.000 --> 02:21.280]  Sweet.
[02:21.980 --> 02:23.660]  Alright, loading it back in. Halo Infinite.
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.440]  Loading Halo Infinite.
[02:24.940 --> 02:28.620]  I'm paranoid now because of Geoff saying he wasn't able to find a game.
[02:29.040 --> 02:35.220]  I mean, I didn't try for a hell of a long time or anything. I just searched for a couple minutes and kind of did what we're doing here.
[02:35.280 --> 02:36.480]  And then I just moved on to the next thing.
[02:37.260 --> 02:41.480]  I figured, like, ah, it's like riding a bike, right? I am Griff. What do I need to search for?
[02:41.480 --> 02:43.560]  Oh yeah, absolutely. No, you got it locked down.
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.400]  Stupid game's named after me.
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.420]  Were you Griff?
[02:48.760 --> 02:49.140]  In what?
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.120]  In Red vs. Blue?
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.160]  No, he was Ball.
[02:51.160 --> 02:51.800]  I thought you were Simmons.
[02:52.780 --> 02:54.640]  Yeah, no, I was Ball, yeah.
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.360]  I don't know who played Griff.
[02:56.600 --> 02:59.340]  I genuinely, I assume it's you, I don't know.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.420]  I remember, I watched the first two seasons.
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.540]  And, uh, really enjoyed it.
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.480]  Don't remember any of it.
[03:05.580 --> 03:08.120]  When it was coming out, I had to go to your website and download it.
[03:08.760 --> 03:09.940]  I do remember that.
[03:10.180 --> 03:10.860]  Then I would go to English class.
[03:10.860 --> 03:11.660]  I do remember that.
[03:11.820 --> 03:13.180]  Thanks for the support, really appreciate it.
[03:13.200 --> 03:14.160]  Oh dude, no problem, absolutely.
[03:14.520 --> 03:15.980]  Let me know if you want a super sponsorship.
[03:16.260 --> 03:16.880]  I'm happy to do it.
[03:17.020 --> 03:17.520]  I'll throw it your way for free.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.080]  A super sponsorship?
[03:19.080 --> 03:21.160]  Yeah, we still do double gold or what?
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.160]  Wait, you're telling me that I can post emotes in the forums?
[03:26.320 --> 03:27.520]  This is fucking crazy.
[03:27.940 --> 03:31.380]  We're making fun of this, but this is how Gavin lived his life, so I don't know.
[03:31.540 --> 03:33.520]  Yeah, that's how I lived my life.
[03:37.700 --> 03:38.740]  Who we missing?
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.460]  While we're talking about Gavin, do you know, Eric, because I bet you don't.
[03:42.740 --> 03:44.340]  Do you know Gavin invented Griffball?
[03:44.940 --> 03:45.480]  Oh, is that right?
[03:45.880 --> 03:48.500]  Yeah, Gavin and Bernie invented Griffball.
[03:48.500 --> 03:55.760]  We were at work, we were playing with Forge Mode, and we made two game types.
[03:55.880 --> 04:00.500]  We made a paintball game type that I helped build, and then I moved on to do some other work.
[04:00.660 --> 04:04.440]  And Gavin and Bernie invented, like, the next thing, the next build was Griffball.
[04:04.580 --> 04:05.660]  And it was just perfect.
[04:06.100 --> 04:08.420]  So we never played the paintball one anymore, and then, yeah.
[04:08.580 --> 04:13.660]  But Bernie and Gavin are the, I guess, progenitor... progenitor?
[04:14.280 --> 04:14.680]  Creators.
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.180]  Did you get the invite, Geoff?
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.080]  Creators, yeah.
[04:17.040 --> 04:18.300]  I had a lot of fun playing this.
[04:18.300 --> 04:21.140]  This was very nostalgic when I played a few games last night.
[04:21.300 --> 04:23.160]  This is how we met you, really.
[04:24.200 --> 04:25.280]  This is how we got to know you.
[04:25.660 --> 04:26.020]  Yes.
[04:26.200 --> 04:26.620]  Is Griffball.
[04:26.980 --> 04:27.780]  Do you guys know that?
[04:28.320 --> 04:29.560]  That Griffball's how we met Andrew?
[04:29.800 --> 04:30.960]  Didn't know that. Crazy.
[04:31.860 --> 04:32.220]  Wow.
[04:32.440 --> 04:33.880]  Were you, like, the number one Griffball player in the world?
[04:35.600 --> 04:35.960]  Ah...
[04:35.960 --> 04:36.180]  Yes, you were.
[04:36.180 --> 04:37.300]  One nobody was playing?
[04:37.600 --> 04:37.840]  Yes.
[04:37.980 --> 04:40.540]  For about three weeks, you were the best Griffball player in the world.
[04:40.580 --> 04:41.100]  Is that right?
[04:41.280 --> 04:43.440]  Better than Gavin, that was, like, a week and a half.
[04:43.580 --> 04:44.440]  Here we go, we're in.
[04:44.440 --> 04:52.560]  We started a Griffball league and had a draft and everything, and Andrew ended up on Bernie's Griffball team, I believe?
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.400]  I got recruited.
[04:53.980 --> 04:56.280]  And instantly became, like...
[04:56.280 --> 04:57.360]  I got recruited.
[04:58.320 --> 04:59.720]  A prolific scorer.
[05:00.040 --> 05:01.660]  He became a prolific scorer, I'll say that.
[05:01.940 --> 05:03.260]  And then that's when he became our narrator.
[05:03.720 --> 05:05.920]  Okay, so, we're about to get into Griffball.
[05:06.100 --> 05:06.780]  This is gonna be great.
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.100]  What are we supposed to do?
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.560]  So there's a ball in the middle.
[05:10.920 --> 05:13.560]  You gotta get the ball and then put it in their end zone.
[05:13.560 --> 05:14.700]  Oh, okay.
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.660]  It's a little circular pad.
[05:17.520 --> 05:17.840]  Right?
[05:18.320 --> 05:20.100]  Yeah, we have swords and gravity hammers.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.140]  Oh, cool.
[05:21.600 --> 05:22.640]  Gotta kill the other people.
[05:23.040 --> 05:25.180]  Get the fuckin' bomb in the thing.
[05:25.340 --> 05:30.360]  Gravity hammer is good. It takes a little bit to charge up and hit, but it can knock people back.
[05:30.760 --> 05:34.220]  Instead of just killing them, you can, like, knock them away to make room for somebody to run by.
[05:34.240 --> 05:34.980]  Oh, this is good to know.
[05:35.240 --> 05:41.320]  And then the Griff, I believe the character playing Griff runs a little faster than everybody else.
[05:41.420 --> 05:41.720]  Oh, he is faster. Cool.
[05:42.240 --> 05:43.940]  You guys created this? That's crazy.
[05:44.300 --> 05:45.800]  I didn't, but Bernie and Gav did.
[05:46.860 --> 05:48.860]  I'd love to take credit for it, but I can't.
[05:49.180 --> 05:49.920]  Yeah, you might as well.
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.020]  I was in the room, but I don't think they did it.
[05:53.780 --> 05:55.060]  I was in the room.
[05:55.320 --> 05:55.920]  I was documenting.
[05:57.200 --> 05:57.420]  Yeah.
[05:57.580 --> 05:59.600]  I said, history is being made here.
[06:00.020 --> 06:01.920]  I was in the room ignoring them.
[06:02.300 --> 06:02.480]  Yep.
[06:02.620 --> 06:03.000]  I believe.
[06:03.200 --> 06:04.180]  High charity court.
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.600]  There's a bunch of different courts in this.
[06:08.140 --> 06:08.720]  Ooh, high charity.
[06:09.100 --> 06:09.560]  Boop boop.
[06:11.780 --> 06:13.200]  Check it out. Default armor.
[06:14.260 --> 06:14.660]  Hello.
[06:14.800 --> 06:15.580]  It's Griff.
[06:15.900 --> 06:16.300]  It's Griff.
[06:16.860 --> 06:17.160]  It's literally Griff.
[06:19.420 --> 06:20.260]  That's pretty funny.
[06:21.000 --> 06:21.700]  Here we go.
[06:22.980 --> 06:25.060]  I wonder if the people we're playing against have any idea.
[06:25.240 --> 06:25.660]  Run for the bomb.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.640]  Oh, I killed Eric.
[06:30.800 --> 06:31.300]  Guys, I'm dead.
[06:31.620 --> 06:33.080]  Yeah, there's a lot of betrayals in Griffball.
[06:33.620 --> 06:34.600]  Okay, they're pushing on the right.
[06:35.200 --> 06:35.600]  Nice.
[06:35.840 --> 06:36.320]  I got it.
[06:36.780 --> 06:37.460]  Okay, good job, Nick.
[06:38.720 --> 06:39.360]  Eric died.
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.600]  This is fast-paced.
[06:41.920 --> 06:42.320]  Yeah.
[06:44.320 --> 06:44.720]  Sorry.
[06:45.300 --> 06:45.960]  Trying to Griffball.
[06:46.240 --> 06:46.680]  Oh, Jesus, Nick.
[06:47.700 --> 06:48.760]  I was pinned to the wall.
[06:49.240 --> 06:50.120]  Who's Griff right now?
[06:50.760 --> 06:51.180]  I was.
[06:51.300 --> 06:51.820]  Nick was.
[06:51.880 --> 06:53.380]  There's a bomb. Pick it up, Eric.
[06:54.200 --> 06:54.760]  Pick it up, Eric.
[06:54.860 --> 06:55.600]  Oh, he didn't grab it.
[06:55.840 --> 06:56.940]  How do I grab it?
[06:57.540 --> 07:00.600]  Right bumper, I believe, or X or something like that.
[07:00.820 --> 07:02.460]  Whatever the prompt is.
[07:03.020 --> 07:04.460]  I didn't see a prompt at all. I'm sorry.
[07:05.080 --> 07:05.480]  That's okay.
[07:08.240 --> 07:09.340]  What? How did I die?
[07:09.920 --> 07:10.600]  I think you tied.
[07:10.760 --> 07:11.440]  Oh, we killed each other.
[07:11.640 --> 07:11.920]  Yeah.
[07:12.300 --> 07:14.020]  Killed by Geoff.
[07:14.220 --> 07:14.440]  To the left.
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.600]  Yeah, there's probably friendly fire.
[07:17.580 --> 07:18.140]  Got him.
[07:18.340 --> 07:19.320]  Oh, there's so much friendly fire.
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.920]  Eric, you killed both of them.
[07:21.940 --> 07:23.600]  Yeah, I heard there's friendly fire.
[07:24.560 --> 07:25.540]  Yes, you did.
[07:25.720 --> 07:26.020]  Sorry.
[07:26.660 --> 07:27.740]  Andrew killed me.
[07:27.980 --> 07:28.340]  True did.
[07:28.480 --> 07:28.900]  Got the bomb.
[07:29.380 --> 07:30.080]  I'm getting it out.
[07:30.380 --> 07:31.640]  You're a Griff man.
[07:32.460 --> 07:33.160]  Get it away.
[07:33.160 --> 07:35.280]  Holy moly.
[07:40.460 --> 07:41.640]  Go, go, go, you're good.
[07:41.640 --> 07:42.300]  Jump, jump.
[07:42.700 --> 07:43.780]  Jump, avoid, jump.
[07:43.960 --> 07:44.680]  Go crazy.
[07:45.140 --> 07:45.640]  Go crazy.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.160]  Score.
[07:46.700 --> 07:47.480]  Yeah, go crazy.
[07:49.260 --> 07:50.440]  Nice job, Andrew.
[07:50.860 --> 07:51.860]  Thank you, Nick.
[07:52.540 --> 07:53.520]  Good job, team.
[07:54.160 --> 07:57.060]  Now I know you have to press a button to pick up the bomb.
[07:57.160 --> 07:57.820]  This is good to know.
[08:02.060 --> 08:03.320]  I did it again.
[08:04.480 --> 08:06.040]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[08:06.040 --> 08:06.600]  Go, go, go.
[08:06.980 --> 08:08.100]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.900]  Way to go.
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.300]  Oh, you did it, wow.
[08:12.480 --> 08:12.880]  2-0.
[08:14.540 --> 08:15.380]  Way to go, boys.
[08:16.760 --> 08:17.640]  One more point.
[08:17.820 --> 08:19.040]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[08:20.240 --> 08:22.140]  Oh, the middle is always such a clusterfuck.
[08:25.540 --> 08:25.900]  Nice.
[08:26.580 --> 08:27.200]  There you go.
[08:27.200 --> 08:27.640]  Oh, no.
[08:28.800 --> 08:29.580]  Balls on the left.
[08:30.340 --> 08:32.020]  They're going for it, they're going for it, I got them.
[08:33.180 --> 08:33.980]  I got it.
[08:35.060 --> 08:35.980]  I got it.
[08:35.980 --> 08:36.780]  I got it.
[08:37.740 --> 08:39.300]  Eric for betraying.
[08:42.120 --> 08:42.440]  Oops.
[08:42.960 --> 08:43.600]  Double kill.
[08:43.820 --> 08:45.220]  You got it, Andrew, you got it.
[08:45.280 --> 08:46.140]  Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[08:47.140 --> 08:48.260]  Just stay alive, stay alive.
[08:48.540 --> 08:49.920]  I couldn't get out of his range.
[08:50.660 --> 08:51.680]  All right, Griff's got it.
[08:51.900 --> 08:52.100]  Yep.
[08:52.240 --> 08:52.840]  Griff's got the Griff.
[08:53.080 --> 08:53.780]  Griff's got the Griff.
[08:54.080 --> 08:54.860]  Griff's got the Griff.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.300]  Oh, he got it, he got it, he got it.
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.200]  Griff's down.
[08:58.740 --> 08:59.440]  Griff's got Griff.
[09:02.240 --> 09:03.060]  Where'd he go?
[09:04.120 --> 09:04.940]  Oh, he's dead.
[09:06.040 --> 09:07.360]  That ball went flying.
[09:07.920 --> 09:08.620]  I'm getting it out.
[09:10.260 --> 09:11.020]  I'm booking it.
[09:11.240 --> 09:11.760]  You got it.
[09:13.280 --> 09:14.220]  Use me as a shield.
[09:14.560 --> 09:15.220]  Go, go, go.
[09:15.420 --> 09:16.180]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[09:16.820 --> 09:17.140]  There you go.
[09:17.200 --> 09:17.480]  Thank you.
[09:18.000 --> 09:18.460]  You got it.
[09:20.480 --> 09:21.320]  Killed by Geoff.
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.280]  That's good, that's good.
[09:23.320 --> 09:25.140]  Killed by Griff in Griff ball? God damn.
[09:25.760 --> 09:26.440]  That's an achievement.
[09:26.620 --> 09:27.160]  Oh, he threw it!
[09:27.180 --> 09:27.960]  Oh, they threw it.
[09:28.640 --> 09:29.780]  Some rugby style.
[09:30.180 --> 09:31.280]  Didn't know you could throw it.
[09:32.000 --> 09:32.580]  Getting it out.
[09:32.580 --> 09:34.540]  Right trigger with the ball to throw.
[09:34.800 --> 09:35.660]  Right bumper to punch.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.100]  Go, go, go.
[09:39.780 --> 09:40.040]  Oh!
[09:40.680 --> 09:41.200]  Try it, Nick.
[09:41.320 --> 09:41.560]  Oh!
[09:42.380 --> 09:42.700]  Shit.
[09:43.640 --> 09:44.420]  Behind you, Andrew.
[09:45.780 --> 09:46.780]  There you go, there you go.
[09:46.820 --> 09:47.120]  Ball back.
[09:47.320 --> 09:47.680]  I got you.
[09:47.840 --> 09:48.240]  I'm pulling.
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.200]  Nice, thank you.
[09:50.980 --> 09:52.000]  We got it, we got it, we got it right here.
[09:52.120 --> 09:52.420]  We got it.
[09:52.480 --> 09:53.780]  Push it, push it, push it, push it.
[09:55.120 --> 09:55.440]  Oh!
[09:57.320 --> 09:57.800]  Get in there!
[09:58.220 --> 09:58.540]  Oh!
[09:59.580 --> 10:00.220]  Right there.
[10:01.460 --> 10:02.400]  They don't know where it is.
[10:02.440 --> 10:02.720]  Now they do.
[10:02.920 --> 10:03.340]  They're stupid.
[10:03.780 --> 10:04.540]  They're gonna throw it.
[10:04.620 --> 10:05.640]  They're throwing it again.
[10:06.440 --> 10:06.960]  Those dirty dogs.
[10:06.960 --> 10:07.760]  You got it, Andrew, you got it.
[10:08.000 --> 10:08.340]  I got it.
[10:08.360 --> 10:09.780]  They just wanted to clear it out, I think.
[10:12.220 --> 10:12.540]  Nice.
[10:12.800 --> 10:13.100]  Alright.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.280]  Oh, Eric with the double.
[10:15.760 --> 10:16.240]  I'm on the move!
[10:18.420 --> 10:18.740]  Oh!
[10:21.760 --> 10:23.080]  You got it right here, you got it.
[10:23.180 --> 10:23.760]  Put it in there.
[10:23.940 --> 10:24.260]  Yeah!
[10:24.540 --> 10:25.620]  That's what I'm talking about, boys.
[10:26.360 --> 10:28.040]  I had a triple kill to win that.
[10:28.360 --> 10:28.680]  Yeah!
[10:28.680 --> 10:29.520]  Three to nothing.
[10:29.520 --> 10:29.900]  Three to zero.
[10:33.360 --> 10:34.680]  I pledge allegiance...
[10:36.220 --> 10:36.740]  Allegiance.
[10:36.900 --> 10:37.840]  Jesus Christ.
[10:37.840 --> 10:39.720]  Allegiance to the flag.
[10:40.040 --> 10:40.460]  Progenitor.
[10:40.880 --> 10:41.600]  To the griff.
[10:42.500 --> 10:43.540]  To the griff.
[10:45.020 --> 10:45.260]  Yeah.
[10:45.260 --> 10:46.500]  Ooh, that's a lot of points.
[10:46.700 --> 10:47.780]  Ooh, congratulations, everybody.
[10:51.100 --> 10:52.400]  Get back in there.
[10:52.460 --> 10:52.700]  Nice job.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.440]  Who want us to go undefeated this run?
[10:55.640 --> 10:56.560]  Yeah, let's go.
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.460]  Let's stop right now.
[10:57.460 --> 10:58.800]  Yeah, then I think we're done.
[10:58.920 --> 11:00.260]  Thank you guys for watching this video.
[11:00.440 --> 11:01.540]  I really appreciate everyone watching.
[11:01.820 --> 11:02.860]  Thanks for coming through.
[11:03.100 --> 11:04.560]  That's it, undefeated in that run.
[11:04.920 --> 11:05.080]  Bye.
[11:05.280 --> 11:05.680]  Bye-bye.
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.140]  Are we playing again?
[11:07.340 --> 11:08.100]  Is it going right into it?
[11:08.260 --> 11:08.400]  Yeah.
[11:08.500 --> 11:08.620]  Yeah.
[11:08.940 --> 11:09.260]  Oh, cool.
[11:09.420 --> 11:10.120]  Launching right back in.
[11:11.740 --> 11:13.240]  Whole world playing griffball right now.
[11:13.460 --> 11:14.020]  You don't want to miss out.
[11:14.240 --> 11:14.600]  Oh!
[11:15.220 --> 11:16.380]  Oh, we're playing in...
[11:16.380 --> 11:16.960]  What is that?
[11:16.980 --> 11:17.680]  Hotline Miami?
[11:17.980 --> 11:18.320]  Yeah.
[11:19.580 --> 11:20.800]  Far Cry Blood Dragon.
[11:21.340 --> 11:21.980]  Yeah, no kidding.
[11:23.900 --> 11:24.780]  Hey, it's Eric.
[11:24.880 --> 11:25.200]  It's me.
[11:25.900 --> 11:26.500]  Hey, it's me.
[11:26.500 --> 11:27.260]  That's Nick.
[11:28.480 --> 11:29.140]  It's me.
[11:29.260 --> 11:29.940]  Merry Christmas.
[11:30.460 --> 11:31.220]  And that's Griff.
[11:31.340 --> 11:32.900]  You still have that Christmas skin, huh?
[11:32.920 --> 11:33.420]  Yeah, I'm the guy.
[11:33.760 --> 11:34.460]  Gotta keep it on.
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.440]  I had that once upon a time.
[11:37.620 --> 11:38.240]  Here we go.
[11:39.680 --> 11:42.660]  We basically invented Rocket League before Rocket League.
[11:42.720 --> 11:43.080]  Yeah.
[11:43.140 --> 11:46.860]  Which is just soccer, so I guess we basically reinvented soccer, which already existed.
[11:47.120 --> 11:47.260]  Yep.
[11:48.300 --> 11:49.060]  Oh, they're pushing.
[11:49.480 --> 11:50.280]  Oh, they're pushing.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.520]  They might be pretty good at this.
[11:54.460 --> 11:55.040]  Oh, we died.
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.160]  Man, they spawn camp me.
[11:56.380 --> 11:57.900]  I'm getting a bad vibe from this.
[11:58.140 --> 11:59.060]  You gotta get moving, boys.
[11:59.840 --> 12:00.220]  Oh!
[12:01.620 --> 12:02.720]  What is going on?
[12:02.720 --> 12:03.300]  We got fucked.
[12:03.480 --> 12:05.800]  Mild Candy has killed everybody.
[12:08.340 --> 12:09.560]  Bomb is in the spawn.
[12:09.700 --> 12:10.140]  I got it.
[12:10.480 --> 12:11.880]  These people know what they're doing.
[12:12.740 --> 12:15.180]  They are, like, staying just out of range of, like, the Gravity Hammer.
[12:15.320 --> 12:16.420]  Like, they know exactly what they're doing.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  They have tactics.
[12:18.300 --> 12:18.840]  Yeah, they know what they're doing.
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.620]  Nice, Nick!
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.140]  They've played this game before.
[12:21.180 --> 12:23.000]  I've never played this, so that's, you know, sort of...
[12:23.840 --> 12:25.340]  You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[12:27.780 --> 12:28.600]  Jesus, dude.
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.480]  How do you know what the distance is on this thing?
[12:30.500 --> 12:31.720]  You just played for hours and hours?
[12:31.720 --> 12:31.880]  Got it.
[12:32.520 --> 12:33.320]  Yeah, there you go.
[12:33.320 --> 12:33.660]  Nice job!
[12:33.980 --> 12:34.680]  Nice job, boys.
[12:36.040 --> 12:36.680]  Round one.
[12:38.340 --> 12:41.100]  Wow, they came at us hard, and we repelled them.
[12:41.100 --> 12:43.200]  They came at us hard, and we finished them off.
[12:48.600 --> 12:51.060]  I'd love to know when the last time was you played football, Geoff.
[12:51.660 --> 12:51.880]  Me?
[12:52.240 --> 12:52.540]  Yeah.
[12:53.180 --> 12:53.980]  Oh, I don't know.
[12:54.440 --> 12:55.340]  I'd love to see.
[12:55.480 --> 12:56.780]  Oh, he launched me back.
[12:57.500 --> 12:57.740]  You good?
[12:58.380 --> 12:59.500]  It's been a minute.
[12:59.500 --> 13:00.060]  It's been a bit.
[13:00.400 --> 13:00.820]  For sure.
[13:07.820 --> 13:08.560]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[13:08.560 --> 13:09.300]  You got it, you got it, you got it.
[13:09.460 --> 13:10.300]  Oh, shit!
[13:10.680 --> 13:10.960]  Grab it!
[13:10.980 --> 13:11.480]  Ah, damn it.
[13:11.620 --> 13:12.140]  Oh, they got it.
[13:12.200 --> 13:12.460]  That's okay.
[13:12.480 --> 13:12.920]  They got it.
[13:13.000 --> 13:13.380]  We're gonna fuck them up.
[13:13.520 --> 13:13.960]  We're okay.
[13:14.340 --> 13:14.760]  We'll get them.
[13:14.820 --> 13:15.840]  They threw it.
[13:17.500 --> 13:18.420]  Damn, they're really good.
[13:21.560 --> 13:21.860]  Also...
[13:25.040 --> 13:25.520]  Got him.
[13:26.200 --> 13:26.960]  Got the bomb.
[13:27.420 --> 13:28.000]  Wasted me.
[13:28.120 --> 13:28.260]  Fuck.
[13:28.660 --> 13:29.300]  Nice, Geoff.
[13:30.020 --> 13:30.520]  There you go.
[13:30.880 --> 13:32.240]  Thank you.
[13:33.360 --> 13:33.680]  Great.
[13:33.760 --> 13:34.260]  There you go, Geoff.
[13:35.580 --> 13:36.700]  Fall back, fall back, fall back.
[13:36.780 --> 13:37.620]  Yeah, pull him back, pull him back.
[13:38.100 --> 13:38.340]  I gotcha.
[13:39.440 --> 13:40.080]  Come on.
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.140]  It is funny how, like, the distance and stuff starts to come back to you after a few minutes.
[13:46.160 --> 13:46.320]  Yeah.
[13:47.000 --> 13:47.660]  Is that right?
[13:47.820 --> 13:47.980]  Yeah.
[13:47.980 --> 13:49.940]  Like, you guys feel like you have, like, a feel for it?
[13:50.080 --> 13:50.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[13:50.920 --> 13:51.600]  I did for a second.
[13:51.800 --> 13:51.840]  That's funny.
[13:51.840 --> 13:53.020]  And then I missed it.
[13:53.280 --> 13:53.480]  Oh, boy.
[13:53.720 --> 13:56.900]  It doesn't mean I'm gonna be good with that feel because I wasn't good to begin with,
[13:57.020 --> 13:58.720]  but I definitely picked it up again.
[13:59.380 --> 14:00.180]  Oh, that guy's good.
[14:00.700 --> 14:01.860]  Oh, get it out, get it out.
[14:02.920 --> 14:04.260]  Oh, I spawned to die.
[14:04.660 --> 14:04.840]  Yeah.
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.900]  Yeah, that's been known to happen.
[14:07.920 --> 14:08.840]  All right, did it again.
[14:08.920 --> 14:09.680]  Trying to keep this guy back.
[14:10.300 --> 14:10.920]  Good job, Geoff.
[14:11.880 --> 14:12.320]  Got him.
[14:12.880 --> 14:13.200]  Nice.
[14:13.260 --> 14:14.740]  If you have to, you could always chuck it across the way.
[14:14.860 --> 14:14.980]  Yeah.
[14:16.640 --> 14:17.460]  Ah, spawn camp.
[14:19.600 --> 14:21.160]  Okay, I don't think he had the distance.
[14:23.040 --> 14:23.400]  Nice.
[14:24.000 --> 14:24.820]  Pushing him back.
[14:25.200 --> 14:25.820]  Oh, that's Geoff.
[14:26.120 --> 14:26.400]  Oh.
[14:26.600 --> 14:26.960]  Oh!
[14:27.260 --> 14:28.040]  You're getting into it, Eric.
[14:28.120 --> 14:28.740]  That was good movement.
[14:29.220 --> 14:29.360]  Yeah.
[14:30.120 --> 14:31.960]  Ah, you figure out the distance.
[14:32.280 --> 14:32.720]  To the right, to the right.
[14:32.860 --> 14:33.420]  Right up the middle.
[14:37.340 --> 14:38.400]  You just have to bait them.
[14:39.440 --> 14:40.500]  Everything's about baiting them.
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.820]  You just have to, like, let them get a little bit too close.
[14:45.640 --> 14:46.000]  Okay.
[14:51.210 --> 14:51.590]  Damn it.
[14:51.630 --> 14:52.830]  What does wizard candy taste like?
[14:53.350 --> 14:53.710]  Shit.
[14:54.190 --> 14:56.090]  I bet it's like Pop Rocks.
[14:56.770 --> 14:57.230]  Got him.
[14:57.490 --> 14:57.850]  Oh.
[14:58.190 --> 14:59.690]  Some wizard candy sounds good.
[14:59.950 --> 15:00.730]  Yeah, it does.
[15:04.360 --> 15:04.960]  Good kill.
[15:05.300 --> 15:05.440]  Okay.
[15:05.620 --> 15:05.980]  There you go.
[15:09.560 --> 15:09.820]  Oh!
[15:10.700 --> 15:11.380]  Ah, fuck.
[15:11.960 --> 15:12.580]  Nice, go!
[15:12.740 --> 15:13.140]  You're good.
[15:13.920 --> 15:14.340]  I got him.
[15:14.340 --> 15:14.620]  Go, go.
[15:15.120 --> 15:15.320]  Yep.
[15:16.000 --> 15:16.660]  Damn it!
[15:17.400 --> 15:18.140]  Alright, I got there.
[15:18.140 --> 15:18.800]  I got it, I got it.
[15:19.620 --> 15:20.180]  I got there.
[15:23.570 --> 15:24.310]  I threw it.
[15:24.930 --> 15:25.030]  Okay.
[15:25.030 --> 15:25.890]  I just want to get it out of there.
[15:25.890 --> 15:26.530]  Sure.
[15:29.050 --> 15:29.920]  Alright, they got it.
[15:31.610 --> 15:32.170]  Watch that right.
[15:32.410 --> 15:33.010]  Oh, they're going for it.
[15:33.170 --> 15:33.710]  Watch that right.
[15:40.030 --> 15:40.850]  Andrew, it's about you.
[15:41.210 --> 15:42.650]  I hammered it away.
[15:43.810 --> 15:44.490]  Come on!
[15:45.190 --> 15:45.530]  Nice!
[15:46.470 --> 15:47.610]  Got it, got it, got it.
[15:47.970 --> 15:48.630]  Go, pass it out.
[15:48.710 --> 15:49.290]  Go, go, go.
[15:50.410 --> 15:51.370]  Gonna hold it for now.
[15:51.810 --> 15:51.970]  Yep.
[15:52.570 --> 15:53.790]  Alright, they're coming up to the right.
[15:55.430 --> 15:56.330]  Nice, good.
[15:56.530 --> 15:56.910]  Got me.
[15:59.230 --> 16:00.170]  Got them both.
[16:02.210 --> 16:03.410]  Okay, I'm pushing left.
[16:03.950 --> 16:04.490]  Do it.
[16:05.610 --> 16:06.390]  That was a hair too close.
[16:06.850 --> 16:07.670]  Okay, coming back.
[16:08.710 --> 16:09.070]  Hey.
[16:10.690 --> 16:11.250]  Oh.
[16:11.930 --> 16:13.410]  Nice job Geoff, you saved my ass.
[16:14.730 --> 16:15.370]  Got him.
[16:15.810 --> 16:16.470]  Come on, Andrew.
[16:17.490 --> 16:17.810]  Yep.
[16:18.190 --> 16:19.010]  Let's get this push going.
[16:20.750 --> 16:21.910]  Alright, let's...
[16:21.910 --> 16:22.230]  Oh!
[16:22.530 --> 16:22.810]  Damn.
[16:25.610 --> 16:26.070]  Alright, boys.
[16:26.110 --> 16:26.910]  You got it, you got it, you got it.
[16:27.410 --> 16:28.670]  Stay alive, Andrew, I'm on my way.
[16:29.090 --> 16:29.350]  Nope.
[16:29.510 --> 16:30.290]  We're all right here, Andrew.
[16:30.410 --> 16:31.110]  You're good, you're good, you're good.
[16:31.330 --> 16:32.050]  Oh, damn.
[16:32.910 --> 16:34.390]  Ah, fuck, they're on Griff on the far right.
[16:34.410 --> 16:34.770]  Yeah, we got him.
[16:35.230 --> 16:35.950]  They threw it, they threw it.
[16:36.070 --> 16:36.130]  Got it.
[16:36.770 --> 16:37.470]  I'm just running.
[16:37.870 --> 16:38.630]  You're good, you're doing great.
[16:38.650 --> 16:39.130]  Oh, I'm dead.
[16:39.370 --> 16:40.270]  They're coming up from the right.
[16:40.390 --> 16:41.050]  I'm just running.
[16:42.670 --> 16:42.950]  Yeah.
[16:43.030 --> 16:43.610]  Oh, shit.
[16:44.290 --> 16:44.930]  They're all tied down.
[16:44.990 --> 16:45.790]  They're coming straight up the middle.
[16:46.710 --> 16:47.530]  Oh, no way!
[16:47.710 --> 16:48.230]  Oh, tied.
[16:48.410 --> 16:48.610]  Okay.
[16:48.890 --> 16:49.390]  That's fine.
[16:49.570 --> 16:50.470]  It burns around.
[16:50.770 --> 16:51.170]  That's fine.
[16:51.490 --> 16:53.690]  If we get one more point, the worst we can do is tie.
[16:57.390 --> 16:58.750]  Okay, big middle push.
[17:01.370 --> 17:02.890]  Oh, I can't believe I got too close.
[17:03.010 --> 17:04.150]  Damn it, I tried to squeeze through.
[17:04.490 --> 17:05.770]  Oh, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming.
[17:07.570 --> 17:07.930]  Yep.
[17:08.410 --> 17:09.250]  God damn it.
[17:09.630 --> 17:10.570]  Oh, I'm playing like shit now.
[17:11.030 --> 17:11.450]  Did I kill him?
[17:11.550 --> 17:12.950]  Oh, that was rough.
[17:13.350 --> 17:14.070]  That was bad.
[17:14.370 --> 17:15.930]  We played so bad on that.
[17:16.070 --> 17:16.710]  That was brutal.
[17:16.850 --> 17:16.950]  Yeah.
[17:17.170 --> 17:17.850]  That was a bad play.
[17:19.190 --> 17:19.550]  Oh, I'm dead.
[17:20.370 --> 17:23.250]  Okay, let's just try to figure out the middle a little bit.
[17:25.330 --> 17:26.870]  Geoff is pushing for it.
[17:28.790 --> 17:29.150]  Okay.
[17:29.870 --> 17:31.490]  I tried to squeeze it by him.
[17:32.990 --> 17:33.770]  Oh, who got me?
[17:38.970 --> 17:41.650]  It's interesting when you respawn and they're like, is that a friendly?
[17:41.910 --> 17:42.070]  Nope.
[17:44.690 --> 17:45.050]  Sorry.
[17:45.230 --> 17:45.650]  Okay, they're to the right.
[17:45.870 --> 17:48.650]  Geoff killed me and then hit me three more times.
[17:50.410 --> 17:51.270]  Back it up, back it up.
[17:51.270 --> 17:51.610]  There you go.
[17:51.690 --> 17:52.550]  Good work.
[17:52.890 --> 17:53.190]  Damn.
[17:55.070 --> 17:56.410]  Oh, God damn it.
[17:59.850 --> 18:01.510]  And they're pushing kind of mid.
[18:06.550 --> 18:07.350]  Got it.
[18:07.450 --> 18:09.030]  Oh, what a play.
[18:09.530 --> 18:12.530]  God, this game is just as frustrating as I remember.
[18:12.850 --> 18:13.130]  Yeah.
[18:13.150 --> 18:13.570]  I got it.
[18:13.890 --> 18:14.850]  Watch out, guy on the right.
[18:15.950 --> 18:16.750]  He's right into me.
[18:16.830 --> 18:17.690]  Got it, got it, got it.
[18:18.090 --> 18:18.810]  Bull-trued me.
[18:19.390 --> 18:22.650]  God, dude, I'm so bad at judging distance on this map for some reason.
[18:23.930 --> 18:24.330]  Oops.
[18:24.570 --> 18:25.410]  They're pushing in.
[18:25.450 --> 18:26.270]  You know who's not?
[18:26.810 --> 18:27.050]  Going left.
[18:27.150 --> 18:27.770]  These guys.
[18:28.810 --> 18:29.150]  Ow.
[18:29.230 --> 18:29.490]  Got him.
[18:30.910 --> 18:31.650]  Thank you, Geoff.
[18:32.030 --> 18:32.310]  Sorry.
[18:32.710 --> 18:33.370]  Going left.
[18:35.190 --> 18:35.450]  Mid.
[18:35.610 --> 18:36.450]  Nice, good play.
[18:38.350 --> 18:39.130]  Oh, betrayed.
[18:39.210 --> 18:39.430]  Pick it up.
[18:39.490 --> 18:39.770]  I got it.
[18:39.790 --> 18:40.030]  Pick it up.
[18:40.090 --> 18:40.810]  Run, run, run, run.
[18:43.910 --> 18:44.530]  They're coming.
[18:45.710 --> 18:46.030]  Okay.
[18:48.510 --> 18:48.870]  Fuck.
[18:49.090 --> 18:49.670]  Throw it.
[18:50.130 --> 18:50.530]  I tried.
[18:50.670 --> 18:51.190]  Did I get it out?
[18:51.270 --> 18:51.710]  No, yeah.
[18:51.790 --> 18:53.250]  Oh, you threw it so far.
[18:53.470 --> 18:53.910]  Did I?
[18:53.910 --> 18:54.610]  Oh, I just...
[18:54.610 --> 18:54.790]  Yeah.
[18:55.350 --> 18:55.650]  Oh.
[18:56.790 --> 18:57.750]  Oh, duct tape.
[18:59.570 --> 19:00.590]  God dang it.
[19:02.410 --> 19:03.390]  So irritating to spawn into that.
[19:03.390 --> 19:04.310]  Kill that guy, kill that guy, kill that guy.
[19:05.170 --> 19:05.710]  He's dead.
[19:06.030 --> 19:06.370]  Nice.
[19:06.730 --> 19:07.310]  They're right.
[19:07.750 --> 19:08.670]  Camping dick wagon.
[19:09.430 --> 19:10.350]  This guy got a dick wagon?
[19:11.310 --> 19:11.870]  Dick wagon.
[19:13.190 --> 19:13.550]  Ow.
[19:13.730 --> 19:14.310]  Oh, who got me?
[19:15.470 --> 19:16.490]  Is there a guy coming, Andrew?
[19:16.670 --> 19:17.030]  Relax, Felix.
[19:17.030 --> 19:17.510]  They got it.
[19:17.830 --> 19:18.270]  Yeah, that's it.
[19:19.370 --> 19:20.170]  No, they didn't get it.
[19:20.190 --> 19:20.530]  They didn't get it.
[19:20.530 --> 19:21.870]  We held, we held.
[19:21.950 --> 19:22.270]  I killed him.
[19:22.650 --> 19:23.790]  Get the ball and get it out.
[19:24.150 --> 19:24.790]  We got it.
[19:24.970 --> 19:25.330]  Damn.
[19:26.050 --> 19:26.410]  Shit.
[19:26.590 --> 19:27.070]  All right, okay.
[19:27.450 --> 19:28.730]  The best we can do is tie.
[19:29.110 --> 19:30.070]  Yep, we can bring it back.
[19:31.610 --> 19:32.330]  Not a problem.
[19:32.930 --> 19:33.570]  We got this.
[19:34.090 --> 19:34.690]  We got this.
[19:35.070 --> 19:35.630]  We got this.
[19:35.630 --> 19:35.790]  All right.
[19:36.530 --> 19:39.050]  We're playing against probably the best griffball team in the world.
[19:39.870 --> 19:40.590]  Oh, undeniably.
[19:42.730 --> 19:43.730]  That was a rough start.
[19:44.330 --> 19:47.070]  Oh, here they come.
[19:48.210 --> 19:49.470]  Okay, killed the bomb guy.
[19:51.110 --> 19:51.470]  Nice.
[19:51.590 --> 19:52.030]  It's all clear.
[19:52.090 --> 19:52.410]  All clear.
[19:52.610 --> 19:53.670]  I am very bad.
[19:53.950 --> 19:54.670]  Very bad.
[20:01.060 --> 20:01.680]  Lane's open.
[20:03.140 --> 20:04.640]  Oh, shit.
[20:04.860 --> 20:05.180]  That's okay.
[20:05.220 --> 20:05.560]  That's okay.
[20:05.580 --> 20:06.120]  You pick that up.
[20:06.180 --> 20:06.520]  I got it back.
[20:06.680 --> 20:07.140]  I got it back.
[20:15.900 --> 20:17.220]  Oh, come on.
[20:18.200 --> 20:18.900]  Oh, man.
[20:18.900 --> 20:19.800]  I thought I could get you.
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.080]  I went to the right.
[20:22.880 --> 20:23.820]  Watch your back, Andrew.
[20:23.820 --> 20:24.260]  He's right behind you, Andrew.
[20:25.240 --> 20:25.980]  I got him.
[20:26.040 --> 20:26.480]  Chased him down.
[20:28.000 --> 20:28.860]  He threw it.
[20:29.620 --> 20:30.300]  Yeah, he sure did.
[20:30.360 --> 20:30.600]  Got it.
[20:30.700 --> 20:30.920]  Down.
[20:34.260 --> 20:35.100]  Ah, terrible.
[20:35.480 --> 20:35.820]  Got him.
[20:36.220 --> 20:36.880]  Got double kill.
[20:37.480 --> 20:38.180]  Went right up the middle.
[20:41.140 --> 20:41.700]  That's it.
[20:41.860 --> 20:42.720]  Ah, damn it.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.140]  They got it.
[20:43.220 --> 20:43.560]  Ah, damn.
[20:44.400 --> 20:44.820]  How?
[20:45.380 --> 20:49.720]  Well, the winning streak continues if we edit that game out.
[20:49.800 --> 20:50.560]  What game?
[20:51.580 --> 20:53.100]  What game was that?
[20:53.880 --> 20:54.500]  Oh, well.
[20:54.820 --> 20:56.440]  Here comes the second round, fellas.
[20:57.740 --> 21:00.080]  Oh, I was not credit to team that game.
[21:01.960 --> 21:02.680]  That was a rough one.
[21:02.980 --> 21:03.340]  It's okay.
[21:06.560 --> 21:07.760]  What did everybody do?
[21:08.920 --> 21:09.900]  You don't want to know.
[21:11.040 --> 21:11.260]  Ooh.
[21:12.340 --> 21:15.340]  Yeah, that is the appropriate response.
[21:16.260 --> 21:16.880]  It was bad.
[21:17.840 --> 21:19.180]  You ever win the championship, Geoff?
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.400]  In the Grip Ball League?
[21:21.680 --> 21:22.580]  In the Grip Ball League, yeah.
[21:22.820 --> 21:23.400]  No, no.
[21:23.540 --> 21:24.200]  I never did.
[21:25.340 --> 21:25.920]  It's okay.
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.340]  The trophy looks like you.
[21:27.500 --> 21:28.360]  You don't need to.
[21:30.940 --> 21:33.900]  Andrew, I win the trophy every day when I get up and look in the mirror.
[21:34.400 --> 21:34.440]  Oh.
[21:35.480 --> 21:38.960]  You wake up, you flip those coins, then you put your socks on, and then...
[21:38.960 --> 21:41.260]  Put my left sock on, right foot, and...
[21:41.260 --> 21:42.620]  Flip those coins.
[21:44.260 --> 21:45.500]  Winter League 2008.
[21:45.700 --> 21:49.300]  Yeah, this gave me big nostalgia when I first loaded into this.
[21:50.520 --> 21:52.940]  There was so much drama at the time.
[21:53.040 --> 21:56.820]  There's a truck that is in a crane in the top right.
[21:57.040 --> 21:59.060]  Or top left, I guess, depending on your side.
[21:59.780 --> 22:01.680]  So much drama in the league around that truck.
[22:02.280 --> 22:03.840]  We put so much into this, Eric.
[22:03.960 --> 22:12.000]  We would release weekly recap videos, highlights with commentating and ESPN SportsCenter type shit.
[22:12.320 --> 22:13.320]  It was a whole thing.
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.540]  Oh, what a goal!
[22:15.620 --> 22:16.160]  That was great.
[22:16.400 --> 22:16.780]  Who was that?
[22:17.140 --> 22:18.480]  One of them wasn't moving.
[22:18.480 --> 22:20.380]  Yeah, I mean, it's a three on four, but that's okay.
[22:20.980 --> 22:23.400]  I'll take it. I just love winning, so this works for me.
[22:23.820 --> 22:24.220]  Yeah.
[22:24.840 --> 22:25.840]  Yeah, I really like this, actually.
[22:25.840 --> 22:27.760]  The truck troubles, people would, like, bounce into it.
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.340]  And, uh...
[22:29.340 --> 22:31.200]  It's like collision-type issues.
[22:31.400 --> 22:32.100]  Yeah, my bad, Andrew.
[22:32.300 --> 22:32.740]  That's so good.
[22:33.220 --> 22:34.760]  Daddy went down. We're fine.
[22:37.900 --> 22:38.300]  Who killed him?
[22:38.620 --> 22:39.280]  Oh, nicked it.
[22:39.280 --> 22:39.840]  Oh, okay.
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.120]  Killed me and Andrew.
[22:41.800 --> 22:41.960]  Yep.
[22:44.820 --> 22:45.220]  Nice!
[22:45.340 --> 22:46.500]  Oh, Andrew, you got robbed.
[22:46.920 --> 22:47.840]  Hey, I died.
[22:47.840 --> 22:48.620]  There's a guy camping.
[22:48.820 --> 22:50.280]  Yeah, to your right, to your right, to your right, to your right.
[22:50.420 --> 22:51.880]  Yeah, they're gonna...
[22:52.260 --> 22:52.580]  Okay.
[22:53.100 --> 22:53.700]  Ties it up.
[22:54.200 --> 22:54.400]  Yeah.
[22:54.800 --> 22:56.780]  They, uh, they love camping right by your spawn.
[22:57.800 --> 22:58.680]  Do you think that's fun?
[22:58.800 --> 22:59.440]  Spawn camping was a big part.
[22:59.760 --> 23:00.720]  Do you think that's fun?
[23:00.980 --> 23:02.720]  It is if you're the person camping.
[23:03.360 --> 23:03.600]  Yeah.
[23:09.780 --> 23:10.100]  Ow.
[23:11.020 --> 23:11.640]  Fuck me.
[23:12.780 --> 23:14.240]  Shit, that ball flying.
[23:14.640 --> 23:14.980]  I'm dead.
[23:15.080 --> 23:15.540]  Where is it?
[23:15.880 --> 23:16.820]  Back of our spawn.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.120]  Oh, there it is.
[23:19.140 --> 23:19.580]  Alright, I got it.
[23:21.360 --> 23:21.740]  Shit.
[23:22.140 --> 23:23.840]  Oh, we're playing the same fucking people again.
[23:24.120 --> 23:24.180]  Yes.
[23:24.260 --> 23:25.160]  Oh, it's a rematch?
[23:25.620 --> 23:26.600]  Yeah, did you not know that?
[23:26.660 --> 23:27.460]  Did you not know that immediately?
[23:27.880 --> 23:28.360]  No, I didn't.
[23:28.520 --> 23:28.820]  Sorry, Jenna.
[23:28.840 --> 23:29.680]  Oh, you guys are crazy.
[23:30.460 --> 23:33.260]  I saw relax, relax, and I went, no, stress, stress.
[23:34.420 --> 23:35.180]  Oh, shit.
[23:37.940 --> 23:38.880]  God dang it.
[23:39.680 --> 23:40.900]  Ah, good job.
[23:41.140 --> 23:41.640]  Who the fuck?
[23:42.840 --> 23:43.820]  Oh, we killed each other.
[23:44.540 --> 23:47.340]  I'm going to put my fist through a wall.
[23:47.620 --> 23:49.520]  I'm not built for online video games.
[23:49.520 --> 23:55.720]  This is like everything that I try to overcome just as like a human man.
[23:56.180 --> 23:58.040]  Like, I can't, I'm not built for this.
[23:58.300 --> 24:01.080]  This is like the worst instincts in me come out.
[24:01.160 --> 24:01.940]  Oh, Geoff, you got it.
[24:02.060 --> 24:02.520]  Get in there.
[24:02.820 --> 24:03.580]  Got it, got it, got it.
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.080]  Oh, yeah.
[24:04.740 --> 24:06.040]  Hell yeah, Geoff.
[24:06.540 --> 24:07.060]  Way to go.
[24:07.720 --> 24:08.320]  I killed them all.
[24:08.560 --> 24:09.380]  Way to go, dude.
[24:09.460 --> 24:10.260]  Great score, Andrew.
[24:10.320 --> 24:10.820]  Was that you, Andrew?
[24:11.080 --> 24:11.740]  That was me.
[24:11.860 --> 24:12.640]  That was all you, though.
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.500]  You led that.
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.320]  That was great.
[24:15.160 --> 24:16.460]  It's all about teamwork.
[24:16.460 --> 24:19.140]  Oh, they tried the leap thing.
[24:21.580 --> 24:22.300]  All right.
[24:25.440 --> 24:27.000]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[24:27.700 --> 24:28.510]  Well, the Geoff...
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.460]  I got you, I got you.
[24:30.740 --> 24:31.520]  Yeah, that was great.
[24:31.660 --> 24:31.960]  Thank you.
[24:32.200 --> 24:34.400]  Okay, I don't know how I didn't kill him at the same time.
[24:35.860 --> 24:37.180]  I'm starting to feel like Eric.
[24:38.140 --> 24:39.400]  A little pinched.
[24:41.200 --> 24:41.800]  That's okay.
[24:42.020 --> 24:43.320]  All right, Eric.
[24:46.320 --> 24:47.700]  God fucking damn it.
[24:47.880 --> 24:48.280]  Okay.
[24:49.540 --> 24:50.780]  I'm not built for this.
[24:51.140 --> 24:54.780]  Every worst instinct comes out in me when I play online games.
[24:54.860 --> 24:57.040]  This is why I stopped playing Call of Duty in 2009.
[24:58.140 --> 24:59.380]  I'm not built for this.
[25:00.640 --> 25:01.620]  This is like...
[25:01.620 --> 25:04.780]  This makes me understand when people just put holes in drywall.
[25:04.920 --> 25:06.940]  It's like, oh, yeah, I remember feeling like that all the time.
[25:10.650 --> 25:11.930]  We're coming, we're coming, we're coming.
[25:11.930 --> 25:14.910]  Holes in drywall should be the name of our gaming-centric podcast.
[25:16.630 --> 25:16.910]  Got him.
[25:17.030 --> 25:17.590]  Two down, two down.
[25:17.670 --> 25:18.530]  Go, jump in, jump in, go.
[25:18.690 --> 25:19.470]  Push him, push him, push him.
[25:21.550 --> 25:21.870]  Nope.
[25:22.250 --> 25:22.930]  God damn it.
[25:23.070 --> 25:23.430]  That ain't gonna work.
[25:23.450 --> 25:23.970]  So close.
[25:24.290 --> 25:25.150]  Geoff, Geoff, grab it.
[25:25.150 --> 25:26.230]  Grab it, grab it.
[25:26.430 --> 25:26.970]  Did I get it?
[25:27.350 --> 25:27.670]  No.
[25:27.930 --> 25:29.490]  No, we're so close.
[25:29.710 --> 25:30.950]  I was backing up into it, but...
[25:33.750 --> 25:34.990]  Yes, no, no, yes.
[25:37.230 --> 25:37.690]  Damn it.
[25:38.790 --> 25:39.570]  Okay, they're pushing left.
[25:39.990 --> 25:41.310]  Yeah, they're going across.
[25:43.970 --> 25:44.770]  Ah, what?
[25:46.270 --> 25:46.670]  Bullshit.
[25:47.330 --> 25:49.710]  Oh, okay, that's right, they have the extra health, don't they?
[25:50.150 --> 25:50.670]  They sure do.
[25:50.810 --> 25:51.490]  Okay, left still.
[25:51.950 --> 25:53.310]  God damn it, he's coming right in.
[25:53.490 --> 25:53.630]  Yeah!
[25:54.290 --> 25:55.110]  Nice, sorry, Eric.
[25:55.490 --> 25:57.190]  I don't care, it's fine with me.
[25:59.690 --> 26:01.830]  As long as we win, I do not care.
[26:03.250 --> 26:03.650]  Ow.
[26:05.310 --> 26:05.710]  God.
[26:09.120 --> 26:11.460]  Whoa, that was an insane lunge.
[26:11.740 --> 26:12.960]  Yeah, that leap was crazy.
[26:14.780 --> 26:15.100]  Ah.
[26:16.440 --> 26:19.000]  I think sometimes it's a little inconsistent with the distance.
[26:19.240 --> 26:20.600]  Right side, right side, back right, back right.
[26:22.960 --> 26:24.020]  And I got me.
[26:24.620 --> 26:24.920]  Whoops.
[26:27.160 --> 26:28.180]  Nice sword kill.
[26:28.300 --> 26:29.320]  You're good, go, go, go.
[26:29.400 --> 26:30.000]  Okay, we're clear.
[26:30.520 --> 26:31.000]  Grabbing it.
[26:31.620 --> 26:32.280]  Push up the right.
[26:32.460 --> 26:32.860]  Thanks, Geoff.
[26:33.320 --> 26:34.440]  I didn't know you were next to me, I'm sorry.
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.180]  You were behind me, I guess.
[26:36.520 --> 26:36.840]  Ow.
[26:38.280 --> 26:39.580]  Oh, they're closing on you.
[26:39.660 --> 26:41.240]  Oh, they got it, they got it, they got it.
[26:41.260 --> 26:41.600]  They got it.
[26:43.800 --> 26:44.680]  Okay, reset.
[26:45.680 --> 26:46.660]  Alright, here we go.
[26:46.920 --> 26:48.180]  Alright, alright, this is for marbles.
[26:49.080 --> 26:50.920]  This is for marbles, everybody likes marbles.
[26:51.500 --> 26:52.480]  I love marbles.
[26:52.680 --> 26:53.180]  I love a marble.
[26:55.100 --> 26:55.980]  Marble ride!
[26:57.020 --> 26:57.460]  Just go.
[26:57.700 --> 26:57.880]  Go.
[26:58.600 --> 26:58.860]  Thank you.
[26:58.980 --> 27:00.140]  Go, go, go.
[27:00.400 --> 27:00.480]  Ah!
[27:03.580 --> 27:04.400]  My death.
[27:04.520 --> 27:05.640]  Camping, camping at the top.
[27:05.860 --> 27:05.980]  Yep.
[27:06.520 --> 27:07.340]  They're just camping.
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.160]  They threw it over.
[27:09.260 --> 27:10.320]  They're just camping, they're camping.
[27:10.900 --> 27:11.740]  Get him, get him.
[27:11.860 --> 27:12.340]  One's dead.
[27:13.840 --> 27:14.600]  I got the ball.
[27:15.200 --> 27:15.920]  Alright, Nick, stay behind.
[27:16.060 --> 27:16.560]  Oh, fuck.
[27:16.920 --> 27:16.960]  Oh.
[27:17.340 --> 27:18.380]  Go, go, go, go.
[27:18.500 --> 27:19.460]  Go, Nick, go, Nick, go, Nick.
[27:19.580 --> 27:19.780]  Ah!
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.720]  Oh, I thought you had the...
[27:22.380 --> 27:22.740]  Yeah.
[27:26.380 --> 27:26.840]  Got it.
[27:27.580 --> 27:28.300]  Good work.
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.300]  Yeah, we're working it.
[27:31.280 --> 27:31.640]  Press.
[27:32.140 --> 27:32.840]  Fall back just a hair.
[27:32.860 --> 27:33.020]  Okay.
[27:33.140 --> 27:33.480]  Fall back.
[27:33.580 --> 27:34.180]  Yep, yep, yep.
[27:35.380 --> 27:36.380]  Nice cover, Eric.
[27:40.660 --> 27:41.720]  Oh, come on.
[27:41.820 --> 27:42.580]  Come on, you got this.
[27:42.580 --> 27:42.920]  Come on.
[27:43.040 --> 27:43.380]  Nice hit, Andrew.
[27:43.740 --> 27:43.900]  Okay.
[27:44.480 --> 27:45.420]  I'll press, I'll press.
[27:46.020 --> 27:46.380]  Nice.
[27:46.560 --> 27:48.380]  Do you just hit with B when you have the ball?
[27:48.480 --> 27:50.640]  I use right bumper, but I may have control of the...
[27:50.640 --> 27:50.740]  Okay.
[27:50.900 --> 27:51.220]  Okay.
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.600]  The range on that swing from that guy is...
[27:55.600 --> 27:56.020]  Oh, shit.
[27:56.040 --> 27:57.140]  I got it downfield, I got it downfield.
[27:57.140 --> 27:57.580]  That's on me.
[27:58.040 --> 27:58.260]  Yeah.
[27:58.640 --> 27:59.240]  Nice job.
[28:03.240 --> 28:03.600]  Damn.
[28:05.560 --> 28:06.280]  Okay, that...
[28:06.280 --> 28:06.460]  Okay.
[28:10.960 --> 28:12.340]  Shields to be down on that Griff.
[28:13.220 --> 28:13.840]  It is.
[28:13.980 --> 28:14.480]  They're back though.
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.360]  Spawn camping, spawn camping.
[28:16.540 --> 28:16.880]  That's it.
[28:17.160 --> 28:17.700]  Yeah, they're behind.
[28:18.060 --> 28:18.560]  I can track.
[28:19.000 --> 28:19.200]  Damn it.
[28:20.540 --> 28:21.540]  I mean, that's not bad.
[28:21.680 --> 28:24.740]  We went 3-2 against the best Griffball team in the world.
[28:26.580 --> 28:28.560]  It's just tough once they get you pinched in.
[28:29.020 --> 28:29.240]  Yep.
[28:29.560 --> 28:30.060]  There you go.
[28:31.000 --> 28:31.940]  Boys, it's Griffball.
[28:32.740 --> 28:33.720]  That is Griffball.
[28:34.960 --> 28:36.440]  It was so funny when I remember the last time we played,
[28:36.440 --> 28:42.400]  the first tournament we did the team lives on, we got destroyed because the other team was spawn camping,
[28:42.580 --> 28:43.820]  and I thought that was so rude.
[28:43.920 --> 28:45.560]  I was so offended by it.
[28:45.740 --> 28:46.620]  I was like, how dare they?
[28:46.740 --> 28:51.000]  That is unsportsmanlike, and that is like the crux of the game.
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.100]  I mean, I hate spawn camping.
[28:53.160 --> 28:53.780]  I think it's bullshit.
[28:54.020 --> 28:54.820]  I think it's fucking bullshit.
[28:55.080 --> 28:56.040]  I don't think it is the crux of the game.
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.100]  I think it's bullshit to do that.
[28:57.160 --> 29:03.020]  I think we should compile a list of things you think is bullshit about Griffball for Gavin when he comes back.
[29:03.240 --> 29:04.940]  I want to watch Gavin play this game.
[29:04.940 --> 29:06.600]  I really want to watch Gavin play this.
[29:06.680 --> 29:07.940]  This is, uh...
[29:07.940 --> 29:10.720]  I can't... this brings out the worst instincts in me.
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.360]  This makes me feel so bad.
[29:12.760 --> 29:14.840]  This, like, physically, it makes me feel bad.
[29:15.300 --> 29:17.020]  Yeah, like it hurts a little bit.
[29:17.020 --> 29:18.940]  Like, yes. Like, physically...
[29:19.640 --> 29:23.380]  It's the thing where I don't know where to put it.
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.580]  Like, the anger that I feel when I play this.
[29:26.960 --> 29:30.200]  And so I just swallow it, and it makes me feel fucking sick.
[29:30.440 --> 29:31.120]  It's like bile.
[29:31.320 --> 29:33.240]  It's like bile in the back of my throat.
[29:33.240 --> 29:36.460]  It's why I stopped playing online multiplayer games like this.
[29:38.320 --> 29:39.740]  It's like, it makes me crazy.
[29:40.000 --> 29:40.900]  Like, this makes me crazy.
[29:41.060 --> 29:42.580]  I don't know how people can do this all the time.
[29:42.840 --> 29:46.940]  It must make people, like, physically ill to do this all the time.
[29:46.960 --> 29:51.800]  Dude, I go through this before every podcast we record, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[29:54.120 --> 29:59.520]  It's this feeling, plus knowing that at any second they could just start the teabag thing,
[29:59.620 --> 30:01.960]  and when they do that, it takes me to 11.
[30:02.100 --> 30:03.080]  Like, I just lose it.
[30:04.320 --> 30:08.420]  Like the purge, I need one day a year where it's socially acceptable.
[30:08.620 --> 30:12.380]  Instead of killing people, just socially acceptable that I can punch holes in drywall.
[30:12.660 --> 30:15.660]  And everyone goes, that's okay, this is the one day.
[30:15.840 --> 30:16.980]  It's drywall day.
[30:17.360 --> 30:21.640]  This is drywall day, this is the day that you're allowed to do that, and no one judges you for it.
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.340]  Because, man, it is...
[30:23.340 --> 30:28.080]  Maybe we need a little drywall phone booth in the office.
[30:28.260 --> 30:32.360]  Dude, it just makes me feel so bad.
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.160]  I'll put a fist through it.
[30:34.340 --> 30:37.620]  This is the thing where it's like, this is what you need therapy for, where it's like,
[30:37.640 --> 30:41.840]  how do you have coping mechanisms so that way it doesn't make you physically sick?
[30:42.800 --> 30:43.280]  That's what this is.
[30:43.280 --> 30:44.380]  I know exactly what you mean, dude.
[30:44.460 --> 30:52.180]  It gives me, not this game, but games where I just cannot get better and are frustrating.
[30:52.320 --> 30:53.820]  It gives me a cringe anger.
[30:54.700 --> 30:55.860]  Where the fuck is the ball?
[30:56.120 --> 30:58.720]  It's on the right. It's in their hands, they have it.
[30:59.540 --> 31:01.820]  And they're pushing the right side. Trip right, trip right.
[31:03.500 --> 31:04.380]  He's up in the wall.
[31:05.100 --> 31:05.920]  He's gonna run it.
[31:06.460 --> 31:08.340]  Yeah, they're gonna spawn campus and then they're gonna get it.
[31:09.720 --> 31:10.640]  Dude, isn't this fun?
[31:11.020 --> 31:12.040]  These guys should play the other team.
[31:12.060 --> 31:12.700]  Dude, isn't this fun?
[31:13.340 --> 31:17.880]  This is like when I play Rocket League and there's people who do the thing where they just flip upside down
[31:17.880 --> 31:20.240]  and start spinning in circles because they scored a goal.
[31:20.980 --> 31:25.000]  It's definitely the like, it's one of those like, how are we playing the same games thing.
[31:26.120 --> 31:28.000]  Like, how are they able to like...
[31:29.660 --> 31:32.440]  I have the same Xbox controller they do. I don't understand.
[31:32.700 --> 31:33.520]  Yeah, but I'm an idiot.
[31:34.120 --> 31:34.480]  Yeah.
[31:35.300 --> 31:40.560]  Oh, it's not right bumper for me. God damn it.
[31:40.920 --> 31:41.160]  Sorry.
[31:41.900 --> 31:42.260]  Drywall.
[31:43.500 --> 31:43.880]  Drywall.
[31:44.460 --> 31:45.500]  Putting in drywall.
[31:47.480 --> 31:48.980]  Are you renovating the house?
[31:49.100 --> 31:51.780]  No, I just, I got into multiplayer games again.
[31:51.960 --> 31:52.820]  I just need a place.
[31:52.820 --> 31:53.500]  What is my spawn camping?
[31:54.220 --> 31:55.080]  Spawn camping.
[31:58.240 --> 31:59.420]  Kay, he's down.
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.060]  Another one on the far right.
[32:01.400 --> 32:05.100]  I don't accept that death game. That's not a real death. Doesn't count.
[32:05.520 --> 32:06.040]  Hit him, hit him.
[32:06.400 --> 32:07.400]  Okay, far left now.
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.260]  Kill the coward.
[32:13.080 --> 32:14.280]  The coward uncounting.
[32:14.340 --> 32:14.560]  Got him, got him.
[32:14.840 --> 32:16.380]  Yes. Behind us.
[32:17.240 --> 32:18.100]  How did that not...
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.320]  Oh, Eric betrayed me. Never mind.
[32:20.320 --> 32:24.300]  It's like some of these dickheads know how to be like one pixel outside of your range.
[32:28.700 --> 32:30.360]  It's okay, we're going left.
[32:30.900 --> 32:32.620]  You're good, you're good, you're good, you're good.
[32:32.680 --> 32:33.500]  Go, go, go, press.
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.640]  Go, press, you're in.
[32:35.920 --> 32:36.960]  You got it, way to go.
[32:38.980 --> 32:39.860]  Fuck you.
[32:40.660 --> 32:41.180]  Fuck you.
[32:41.240 --> 32:42.240]  On the board.
[32:42.760 --> 32:43.440]  Go to hell.
[32:45.840 --> 32:46.720]  Drywall, drywall.
[32:46.720 --> 32:50.500]  I like the drywall thing because it does take a little bit of the edge off.
[32:50.780 --> 32:51.220]  Yeah.
[32:54.740 --> 32:55.580]  Got him, go.
[32:57.580 --> 32:58.460]  Well, that's...
[32:59.080 --> 32:59.520]  That's...
[32:59.520 --> 33:01.240]  That's good right there.
[33:01.480 --> 33:02.800]  That's what I'm talking about.
[33:03.100 --> 33:04.080]  That's some drywalling right there.
[33:04.460 --> 33:06.620]  That's my best round. That's my best round.
[33:06.640 --> 33:07.280]  Nice job.
[33:07.640 --> 33:08.100]  Good job, Eric.
[33:08.300 --> 33:09.400]  They're punching drywall.
[33:10.880 --> 33:12.160]  Right now, they're mad.
[33:12.400 --> 33:14.740]  You think they're talking about having a drywall phone booth right now because of that?
[33:15.280 --> 33:15.500]  Absolutely.
[33:16.100 --> 33:17.120]  Oh, he got it, he got it, he got it.
[33:17.120 --> 33:18.360]  Yeah, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[33:18.560 --> 33:18.660]  We're good.
[33:20.060 --> 33:21.000]  They're getting desperate.
[33:21.240 --> 33:22.120]  They're doing crazy shit.
[33:22.200 --> 33:22.940]  I'm with you again, Eric.
[33:24.520 --> 33:25.040]  Oh, shit.
[33:25.040 --> 33:25.540]  Nah, he got me.
[33:25.980 --> 33:26.460]  I'm coming up.
[33:26.660 --> 33:26.700]  I baited, I baited, I baited.
[33:26.700 --> 33:28.080]  There was like four people on you.
[33:28.420 --> 33:29.080]  Yeah, I baited.
[33:29.360 --> 33:31.440]  It was fucking pointless shit.
[33:34.440 --> 33:34.800]  I'm dead.
[33:35.980 --> 33:36.480]  I'm dead.
[33:36.920 --> 33:37.660]  Okay, to the right.
[33:37.700 --> 33:38.080]  They got it.
[33:40.140 --> 33:41.100]  He got me, I suck.
[33:41.360 --> 33:41.660]  Fuck!
[33:42.460 --> 33:42.780]  Okay.
[33:46.200 --> 33:48.200]  Spawn camping, spawn camping, spawn camping.
[33:48.260 --> 33:48.660]  Go for it.
[33:49.460 --> 33:49.860]  You got him.
[33:49.980 --> 33:50.880]  Yep, they sure are.
[33:51.000 --> 33:51.160]  Damn it.
[34:00.600 --> 34:06.460]  Hey, boys, why are you killing me?
[34:06.500 --> 34:07.060]  Don't you know it's me?
[34:09.220 --> 34:10.380]  Don't you know that's my ball?
[34:10.560 --> 34:10.920]  I'll take it.
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.880]  I earned a mythical medal in a matchmaking, man.
[34:13.880 --> 34:14.540]  I don't know what that means.
[34:14.860 --> 34:15.780]  That's fucking awesome.
[34:16.980 --> 34:17.960]  You got a lot of kills.
[34:18.240 --> 34:19.560]  I'm going to write you a congratulations letter.
[34:19.740 --> 34:19.800]  Yeah.
[34:23.900 --> 34:24.620]  Watch that left.
[34:24.780 --> 34:25.260]  Nick, you got it.
[34:25.320 --> 34:25.840]  Nick, you got it.
[34:28.040 --> 34:28.420]  Got him.
[34:28.500 --> 34:29.140]  Nice, good work.
[34:29.740 --> 34:30.720]  Press, press, all sides.
[34:30.960 --> 34:31.500]  Press all sides.
[34:31.780 --> 34:32.700]  Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[34:32.720 --> 34:33.020]  Kill him.
[34:33.100 --> 34:33.360]  Nice.
[34:33.580 --> 34:34.040]  Got him.
[34:34.960 --> 34:35.240]  Back.
[34:35.640 --> 34:36.220]  Yes, got two.
[34:36.420 --> 34:37.280]  Get it, get it, get it, get it.
[34:37.300 --> 34:38.060]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.360]  God damn it.
[34:39.620 --> 34:39.960]  Good try.
[34:40.160 --> 34:40.960]  Oh, you got him.
[34:41.220 --> 34:42.200]  If Andrew can get to it.
[34:42.220 --> 34:43.080]  Oh my God, it's right there.
[34:43.080 --> 34:44.280]  I got two, but I'm not going to be able to push.
[34:44.380 --> 34:45.340]  Back up, back up, back up.
[34:45.340 --> 34:45.640]  You're good.
[34:45.660 --> 34:46.400]  Back up, back up.
[34:46.540 --> 34:47.220]  You're fine, you're fine.
[34:47.480 --> 34:47.680]  Double.
[34:47.980 --> 34:48.480]  Press, press left.
[34:48.480 --> 34:49.200]  Press left.
[34:49.620 --> 34:49.880]  Go.
[34:50.060 --> 34:51.100]  Press it, press it, press it, press it.
[34:51.300 --> 34:51.460]  Oh, damn it.
[34:52.580 --> 34:53.420]  That's what I'm talking about.
[34:53.500 --> 34:54.440]  Good job, guys.
[34:54.500 --> 34:55.200]  Good work, boys.
[34:55.480 --> 34:56.100]  Fuck yeah.
[34:56.380 --> 34:56.780]  Woo, woo, woo, woo.
[34:56.780 --> 34:57.540]  You know what I heard?
[34:57.820 --> 35:02.180]  I heard that team considered themselves even better than the last team we played, so beating
[35:02.180 --> 35:05.400]  them is really like beating that other team every round, so we're kind of 4-0 right now.
[35:05.460 --> 35:06.740]  Oh shit, really?
[35:07.340 --> 35:07.580]  Yeah.
[35:11.180 --> 35:13.240]  Chalk one up for the drywall punchers.
[35:13.280 --> 35:14.120]  Chalk one up.
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.080]  That was my best, that was my best game that I've played here, and it feels no different
[35:17.080 --> 35:17.560]  from losing.
[35:18.120 --> 35:18.440]  Really?
[35:18.840 --> 35:19.540]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:20.500 --> 35:21.620]  It felt different?
[35:21.940 --> 35:22.200]  Nope.
[35:22.380 --> 35:22.940]  As a teammate?
[35:23.340 --> 35:23.500]  Nope.
[35:23.580 --> 35:24.520]  I felt different.
[35:24.540 --> 35:25.460]  It feels no different.
[35:25.780 --> 35:31.160]  Kill four enemies, I got overkill, triple kill, double kill, bolt, true, kill, joy.
[35:31.680 --> 35:32.720]  No, none of it felt different.
[35:32.820 --> 35:36.460]  All of it feels, I just, there's, I don't know where to put any of it.
[35:37.480 --> 35:37.880]  Drywall.
[35:38.400 --> 35:39.120]  Yeah, pretty much.
[35:41.180 --> 35:43.740]  Alright, one more, because I don't know if I can physically do more than that.
[35:43.740 --> 35:45.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:45.080 --> 35:45.700]  Last one.
[35:45.920 --> 35:48.720]  This is the last round of griffball that Eric can physically do.
[35:48.860 --> 35:49.960]  I think that might be true.
[35:49.980 --> 35:52.960]  We're gonna have to extract as much joy as possible.
[35:55.160 --> 35:57.660]  It just, it fucks me up so bad.
[35:57.860 --> 35:58.460]  You can't do it.
[35:58.620 --> 35:59.660]  It makes me feel awful.
[36:00.040 --> 36:00.920]  If you can't do it, you can't do it.
[36:01.380 --> 36:02.340]  Yeah, we get it.
[36:04.660 --> 36:05.580]  Ooh, underwater cage.
[36:06.140 --> 36:08.380]  I really wanna watch Gavin play this.
[36:09.660 --> 36:10.940]  Like, I really wanna see it.
[36:11.940 --> 36:12.320]  Cool.
[36:13.940 --> 36:14.920]  I don't know why.
[36:16.000 --> 36:17.160]  He invented it.
[36:18.560 --> 36:19.660]  Yeah, surely he knows some tricks.
[36:19.660 --> 36:21.940]  He's not, he's, I wouldn't say he's very good or anything.
[36:23.020 --> 36:24.760]  No, it's the same team!
[36:25.820 --> 36:27.120]  It's relax, relax!
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.720]  Oh, relax, relax is back!
[36:30.100 --> 36:31.520]  No, it's that team!
[36:32.180 --> 36:33.860]  Yeah, but he's playing with the Wizzy guy now.
[36:35.120 --> 36:37.120]  He was good, so that's, I don't like that.
[36:37.120 --> 36:37.280]  Oh.
[36:42.460 --> 36:44.500]  Leave me alone, relax, relax!
[36:45.560 --> 36:47.360]  Relax, don't do it.
[36:47.540 --> 36:49.120]  When you wanna score the Griff ball.
[36:49.520 --> 36:51.020]  Relax, don't do it.
[36:51.200 --> 36:52.280]  Eric's gonna come.
[36:53.160 --> 36:54.060]  Eric's gonna come.
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.660]  If that's what happened when I played this, I'd play it all the time.
[36:56.840 --> 36:59.240]  I don't cum, it just makes me mad.
[37:00.840 --> 37:01.280]  Geoff.
[37:01.680 --> 37:02.140]  That's me.
[37:03.100 --> 37:03.600]  You killed me.
[37:04.000 --> 37:04.780]  What are you gonna do?
[37:06.460 --> 37:07.380]  Well, come back to life.
[37:07.380 --> 37:08.400]  Watch that right side, watch that right side!
[37:08.560 --> 37:08.900]  Got him.
[37:10.320 --> 37:11.220]  Relax, relax, he's down.
[37:11.700 --> 37:13.480]  I didn't do that on purpose, I want you to know.
[37:13.860 --> 37:14.140]  Shit.
[37:14.700 --> 37:16.080]  There you go, good, good play, good play.
[37:16.240 --> 37:17.240]  Push, Ray, push, Ray, push.
[37:17.280 --> 37:18.040]  He's coming, he's coming!
[37:18.300 --> 37:18.620]  They're in.
[37:18.820 --> 37:19.500]  Oh, you got him!
[37:20.040 --> 37:20.600]  Geoff, run!
[37:20.960 --> 37:21.860]  Oh, he's still there though.
[37:23.180 --> 37:24.020]  I got it, I'm out.
[37:24.560 --> 37:25.040]  Good work.
[37:25.120 --> 37:25.460]  Okay, we're good.
[37:26.700 --> 37:27.500]  We can slow it down.
[37:28.700 --> 37:29.660]  Speed it up, slow it down.
[37:29.660 --> 37:30.820]  Got him, relax, relax, he's down.
[37:30.920 --> 37:31.280]  Speed it up.
[37:33.340 --> 37:34.220]  Okay, they got it.
[37:34.360 --> 37:34.540]  Got him!
[37:34.640 --> 37:35.180]  Alright, I killed him.
[37:35.260 --> 37:35.860]  Relax, relax.
[37:36.360 --> 37:37.480]  And he killed me as well.
[37:40.420 --> 37:41.820]  Jack, the train is down.
[37:42.280 --> 37:42.500]  Yep.
[37:43.840 --> 37:44.380]  Nick, move right.
[37:46.920 --> 37:47.360]  Bloatin'.
[37:47.900 --> 37:48.540]  Ah, shit.
[37:48.540 --> 37:49.240]  Sorry, Eric.
[37:53.190 --> 37:53.950]  Boys, boys, boys.
[37:53.950 --> 37:55.170]  Dang it, I can't throw it.
[37:55.230 --> 37:55.550]  Triple.
[37:56.090 --> 37:56.530]  He...
[37:56.530 --> 37:57.230]  He...
[37:57.230 --> 37:59.790]  Four-head jacked me so bad.
[38:00.570 --> 38:01.570]  He killed me too.
[38:03.350 --> 38:04.850]  Okay, middle push, middle push.
[38:06.630 --> 38:06.990]  Nice.
[38:07.330 --> 38:08.830]  Pinzer, don't all converge.
[38:08.950 --> 38:09.610]  Go left and right of him.
[38:09.830 --> 38:10.550]  Yep, yep.
[38:17.430 --> 38:18.170]  Relax, relax.
[38:19.610 --> 38:21.190]  I'm pretty sure that's a Russian bot.
[38:24.490 --> 38:26.430]  Just some fuckin' stoner that works at the mall.
[38:28.170 --> 38:29.870]  Reads fuckin' Fangoria Magazine.
[38:30.490 --> 38:31.210]  Nice job, Geoff!
[38:31.290 --> 38:31.510]  No!
[38:31.850 --> 38:32.950]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[38:33.330 --> 38:33.590]  Me.
[38:33.610 --> 38:34.030]  Score that bitch.
[38:34.050 --> 38:34.310]  I'm dead.
[38:34.310 --> 38:36.910]  I mean, realistically, the time we're playing...
[38:36.910 --> 38:37.530]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[38:37.550 --> 38:38.370]  Me, me, me, I got it, I got it.
[38:38.390 --> 38:38.810]  These are all kids on break.
[38:39.170 --> 38:39.770]  A hundred percent.
[38:40.170 --> 38:42.070]  It's summer and they're playing this and they went...
[38:42.070 --> 38:43.950]  I remember when my dad used to play this mode.
[38:45.650 --> 38:47.970]  Whoever slacked me better have a good reason.
[38:49.110 --> 38:50.590]  If they did, they'd be outside playing Cache.
[38:50.650 --> 38:51.650]  Oh, what a kill!
[38:52.390 --> 38:53.350]  Andrew, I got you, I got you.
[38:54.050 --> 38:54.370]  Nice.
[38:54.570 --> 38:55.190]  Oh, fuck.
[38:55.710 --> 38:57.190]  Okay, now we can build off this.
[38:59.730 --> 39:00.430]  Andrew, fall back.
[39:00.470 --> 39:01.430]  You can no longer build on this.
[39:05.010 --> 39:06.850]  You had a tenuous hold at best.
[39:07.130 --> 39:07.830]  There you go.
[39:08.130 --> 39:09.210]  Good press, good press.
[39:09.270 --> 39:09.870]  You got it.
[39:11.630 --> 39:12.450]  Saw that coming.
[39:13.350 --> 39:15.750]  So many fucking text messages and shit right now.
[39:16.170 --> 39:17.190]  Yeah, me too.
[39:17.430 --> 39:17.990]  Tell them you're playing Griffball.
[39:18.250 --> 39:18.810]  They'll understand.
[39:22.640 --> 39:23.080]  Overtime.
[39:23.240 --> 39:23.560]  Oh, shit.
[39:24.300 --> 39:24.640]  They're pushing.
[39:25.500 --> 39:25.940]  Overtime.
[39:26.340 --> 39:26.660]  Thanks, Geoff.
[39:29.140 --> 39:29.580]  Okay.
[39:29.720 --> 39:30.720]  That's my bad, Andrew.
[39:30.820 --> 39:31.300]  That's okay.
[39:32.680 --> 39:33.200]  Got him.
[39:33.320 --> 39:34.780]  I think I got the...
[39:34.780 --> 39:35.340]  Got the ball!
[39:35.500 --> 39:36.540]  Run, run, run, run, run!
[39:36.900 --> 39:38.180]  Alright, slow, slow it up.
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.120]  You guys got it, you guys got it.
[39:48.160 --> 39:48.560]  Nick, turn around.
[39:48.620 --> 39:48.900]  There you go.
[39:50.180 --> 39:51.360]  I took that guy with me.
[39:51.420 --> 39:51.720]  Got him.
[39:52.340 --> 39:52.880]  God damn it.
[39:57.910 --> 39:58.490]  Nice, Geoff.
[39:58.710 --> 39:59.390]  Watch your right, Geoff.
[40:00.990 --> 40:01.750]  Go, Andrew, go!
[40:03.170 --> 40:03.810]  I couldn't.
[40:04.170 --> 40:04.870]  Oh, bullshit.
[40:05.030 --> 40:05.570]  God damn it.
[40:10.180 --> 40:16.130]  Oh, fuck.
[40:16.130 --> 40:17.150]  That's fine.
[40:19.310 --> 40:19.750]  It's all good.
[40:20.110 --> 40:21.130]  We're gonna tie it up.
[40:25.930 --> 40:27.530]  Wow, that was intense.
[40:28.350 --> 40:29.590]  That was the first round.
[40:29.830 --> 40:30.990]  I thought it was the end of the game.
[40:31.290 --> 40:35.870]  Do you think these guys are like, holy shit, we didn't know there were people out there that were as good as us at Griffball.
[40:36.590 --> 40:38.770]  I think the people on the outside are going...
[40:39.110 --> 40:41.750]  Mom, I want my Scooby-Doo snacks now!
[40:42.090 --> 40:42.530]  Mom!
[40:43.610 --> 40:45.130]  Take out the trash, Carl.
[40:45.730 --> 40:46.710]  Mom, I'm playing Griffball.
[40:46.710 --> 40:47.850]  I'm in the middle of the game.
[40:48.030 --> 40:49.930]  I'm playing Griffball with the real Griff guy.
[40:51.990 --> 40:52.350]  Gavin?
[40:54.770 --> 40:55.370]  They're coming.
[40:55.630 --> 40:56.090]  Up the gut.
[40:56.170 --> 40:57.030]  Oh, they're going for it.
[40:57.070 --> 40:58.090]  They're going for it.
[40:58.250 --> 40:58.990]  They got it.
[40:59.870 --> 41:00.230]  Ow!
[41:01.550 --> 41:02.310]  Good for them.
[41:03.090 --> 41:03.770]  Good for them.
[41:04.150 --> 41:04.790]  Well, drywall.
[41:05.850 --> 41:06.890]  Oh, that guy's teabagging.
[41:06.970 --> 41:07.530]  Fuck that guy.
[41:07.630 --> 41:07.850]  Drywall.
[41:10.610 --> 41:10.970]  Alright.
[41:12.730 --> 41:13.870]  At least that was a quick round.
[41:15.370 --> 41:16.750]  It's less emotionally draining.
[41:17.350 --> 41:18.410]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[41:19.650 --> 41:20.290]  Oh, bullshit.
[41:21.650 --> 41:22.110]  Got him.
[41:22.390 --> 41:22.630]  Drywall.
[41:22.790 --> 41:23.330]  Got the ball back.
[41:24.310 --> 41:24.730]  Ball back.
[41:28.390 --> 41:28.890]  I'm coming.
[41:28.950 --> 41:29.350]  Coming around.
[41:30.410 --> 41:30.990]  Got one.
[41:31.110 --> 41:31.450]  Thank you.
[41:31.610 --> 41:32.070]  Got the other.
[41:32.150 --> 41:32.490]  Go, press.
[41:33.050 --> 41:33.870]  Yeah, you got it.
[41:34.030 --> 41:34.510]  There you go.
[41:34.570 --> 41:35.430]  Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[41:35.510 --> 41:36.330]  That's how you do it.
[41:36.390 --> 41:37.170]  That's how you do it.
[41:38.070 --> 41:38.930]  That's how you press.
[41:38.970 --> 41:40.530]  You press that one side, pull them off.
[41:40.590 --> 41:41.670]  Everyone comes up from behind.
[41:42.030 --> 41:43.010]  That's the way you do it, boys.
[41:43.010 --> 41:43.470]  Way to go.
[41:44.290 --> 41:44.850]  Fuck you.
[41:44.930 --> 41:45.670]  One more, one more.
[41:45.670 --> 41:46.470]  Let's go, one more, huh?
[41:46.650 --> 41:47.610]  Let's go, you guys got it.
[41:47.710 --> 41:48.030]  Let's go.
[41:49.870 --> 41:50.270]  Got it.
[41:50.810 --> 41:51.410]  Nope, died.
[41:51.530 --> 41:51.710]  Alright.
[41:52.530 --> 41:52.810]  Nope.
[41:53.990 --> 41:54.450]  They're pushing.
[41:54.550 --> 41:54.850]  They're pushing.
[41:55.510 --> 41:55.790]  Nice.
[41:57.750 --> 41:58.530]  Sorry, I got excited.
[41:58.850 --> 41:59.290]  No worries.
[41:59.330 --> 41:59.670]  I'm loose.
[41:59.790 --> 42:00.090]  That happens.
[42:00.770 --> 42:01.610]  Just started swinging.
[42:01.870 --> 42:03.730]  I thought relax, relax was right there and I just got scared.
[42:08.180 --> 42:09.360]  And I got a good push on the right.
[42:09.760 --> 42:10.440]  Got him, got him, got him.
[42:10.460 --> 42:10.980]  You guys got it.
[42:11.080 --> 42:11.880]  Oh, way to go, Nick.
[42:11.940 --> 42:12.520]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[42:12.520 --> 42:12.880]  Good job.
[42:13.020 --> 42:13.500]  Kill Andrew.
[42:14.500 --> 42:15.200]  You got him.
[42:15.340 --> 42:16.700]  You're ultimate enemy.
[42:20.820 --> 42:23.640]  Jack the Train, when I find you, I'm going to destroy you.
[42:23.800 --> 42:24.420]  Middle, middle, middle.
[42:24.540 --> 42:25.180]  I killed his own teammate.
[42:25.920 --> 42:26.240]  Dead.
[42:26.560 --> 42:26.800]  That's it.
[42:27.480 --> 42:27.700]  Damn.
[42:27.880 --> 42:28.580]  Okay, that's fine.
[42:29.260 --> 42:30.040]  One more, we can tie it.
[42:33.800 --> 42:35.300]  I don't know how people do this all day.
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.460]  Like, I don't know how, like, you just must not care about winning and losing.
[42:39.740 --> 42:42.780]  You must just go like, yeah, I don't know, I just kind of like turn off my brain and do
[42:42.780 --> 42:44.760]  it, and it's like, that's like the craziest thing in the world.
[42:45.160 --> 42:46.200]  Or they just get really good.
[42:46.580 --> 42:47.200]  Oh, shit.
[42:48.940 --> 42:52.780]  But like, you know there's like a, I don't know, it's just like, it's fucking crazy.
[42:55.700 --> 42:56.020]  Damn.
[42:57.840 --> 42:58.500]  Good push, Nick.
[42:58.500 --> 42:58.920]  You got it, Nick.
[42:59.020 --> 42:59.560]  Nick, you got it.
[43:00.640 --> 43:00.960]  Nope.
[43:01.760 --> 43:02.620]  His shield is down, though.
[43:02.740 --> 43:02.880]  Yep.
[43:03.580 --> 43:04.240]  And then I died.
[43:04.880 --> 43:05.520]  Got a spawn killer.
[43:05.680 --> 43:06.140]  Spawn camp.
[43:06.180 --> 43:06.500]  Spawn kill.
[43:06.920 --> 43:07.380]  He's dead.
[43:07.720 --> 43:08.220]  I killed him.
[43:08.420 --> 43:08.840]  Spawn camp.
[43:08.920 --> 43:09.380]  Relax, relax.
[43:09.380 --> 43:09.660]  Relax in the back.
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.540]  Relax, relax in the back.
[43:10.620 --> 43:10.920]  Behind you.
[43:11.340 --> 43:11.700]  Behind you.
[43:13.520 --> 43:13.880]  He's dead.
[43:13.880 --> 43:14.100]  There you go.
[43:14.180 --> 43:14.500]  Thank you.
[43:16.360 --> 43:17.100]  Oh, okay.
[43:17.260 --> 43:17.700]  Right push.
[43:18.100 --> 43:19.320]  Guy right there on the spawn.
[43:19.460 --> 43:19.820]  Got him.
[43:22.800 --> 43:23.360]  All right.
[43:23.640 --> 43:24.120]  This is fun.
[43:26.020 --> 43:26.820]  Where's the ball?
[43:26.940 --> 43:27.200]  Sorry.
[43:27.380 --> 43:27.620]  Sorry.
[43:27.660 --> 43:27.860]  God!
[43:30.740 --> 43:32.520]  I just, there were so many spawn killings.
[43:32.520 --> 43:33.240]  I know, it's okay.
[43:33.440 --> 43:35.260]  I just like, spawn and start swinging immediately.
[43:35.540 --> 43:36.220]  It's all right.
[43:36.260 --> 43:36.880]  I don't blame you.
[43:37.240 --> 43:37.900]  I don't blame you.
[43:37.900 --> 43:38.460]  Clear it out.
[43:39.460 --> 43:39.820]  Okay.
[43:42.540 --> 43:42.900]  Yep.
[43:43.900 --> 43:44.760]  Well, that's it.
[43:44.940 --> 43:45.500]  Well, it was fun.
[43:45.580 --> 43:45.720]  Well.
[43:47.940 --> 43:52.500]  I'd like to continue having a company with Eric, so we are going to end this video here.
[43:52.500 --> 43:53.080]  Thank you very much.
[43:53.180 --> 43:53.940]  I appreciate that.
[43:54.060 --> 43:54.340]  Thank you.
[43:54.460 --> 43:54.980]  Relax, relax.
[43:55.080 --> 43:56.100]  I'm going to beat you up.
[43:59.120 --> 44:00.260]  Take all his lunch money.
[44:00.700 --> 44:00.860]  Yep.
[44:01.040 --> 44:01.900]  This has been Griffball.
[44:02.500 --> 44:06.060]  I enjoyed this as someone who played it a lot in the past.
[44:06.060 --> 44:06.760]  Yeah, it was fun.
[44:06.760 --> 44:09.720]  Maybe we'll do this again with Gavin.
[44:09.920 --> 44:11.580]  Get all the trip, trips?
[44:12.100 --> 44:12.980]  All the tricks.
[44:13.480 --> 44:14.440]  I don't know why he would trip.
[44:14.780 --> 44:16.380]  Although, I always enjoy a Gavin trip.
[44:16.600 --> 44:17.860]  He falls very well.
[44:17.960 --> 44:19.720]  It depends on if Gavin or Stuart's playing.
[44:20.080 --> 44:20.820]  That's true.
[44:20.920 --> 44:21.580]  That's a good point.
[44:21.680 --> 44:24.100]  Maybe he'll sign in on his alternate account of Stuart.
[44:24.720 --> 44:26.300]  But, thank you so much for watching.
[44:26.740 --> 44:28.800]  Check out the Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[44:30.100 --> 44:30.980]  We couldn't do it without you.
[44:31.400 --> 44:31.960]  We love you.
[44:32.440 --> 44:32.680]  Bye.
[44:33.300 --> 44:34.000]  Bye-bye.
[44:34.580 --> 44:34.880]  Bye.
[44:34.880 --> 44:35.740]  Match lost.
[44:35.840 --> 44:36.880]  That doesn't just make you mad.
[44:37.100 --> 44:38.600]  That doesn't make you sick to your stomach.
[44:38.860 --> 44:39.540]  Oh my God.
[44:39.680 --> 44:40.280]  Let me do this.
[44:40.800 --> 44:43.540]  This is Private Dexter Griff signing off.
[44:43.600 --> 44:44.040]  Whoa!
[44:47.580 --> 44:48.860]  Son of a bitch!
