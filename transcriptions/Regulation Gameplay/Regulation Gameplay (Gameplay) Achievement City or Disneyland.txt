[00:00.000 --> 00:01.580]  So where are you? I've already lost you.
[00:02.020 --> 00:04.080]  That X thing, I couldn't figure out what it was from...
[00:04.860 --> 00:10.380]  Uh, I vaguely remember it was some sort of a contest where you'd get like a weapon and have to fight and like...
[00:10.380 --> 00:12.220]  Like little people would come out of the walls. Yeah.
[00:12.580 --> 00:15.640]  Man, Snowbound was a cool Let's Play that we never did again and we should have.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.560]  We should have done the Snowbound X. Maybe we did. I don't know.
[00:18.720 --> 00:23.260]  The draw distance, I think the thing that's so weird to me is the draw distance is so much further than it used to be.
[00:23.560 --> 00:25.240]  It's crazy. And it kind of fades in now.
[00:26.040 --> 00:28.060]  It's crazy how much you can see all at once.
[00:28.060 --> 00:29.540]  I like this looks...
[00:29.540 --> 00:30.500]  It feels like...
[00:30.500 --> 00:34.800]  It feels like I just went to Disneyland like a month ago. This is what it looks like when you look up.
[00:35.460 --> 00:38.120]  Just... impossible structures in the distance that make no sense.
[00:38.280 --> 00:40.120]  I don't know if it... it kind of makes it feel smaller.
[00:40.340 --> 00:43.960]  Like being able to see the Altar of Pimps in the same frame as Dan the Man.
[00:44.200 --> 00:46.600]  Yeah, it does. I feel like that would have never loaded together.
[00:47.320 --> 00:49.640]  It does compact it in some way. Where are you?
[00:49.980 --> 00:51.020]  Oh, I'm walking the back.
[00:51.840 --> 00:52.540]  Is this Snowbound?
[00:53.880 --> 00:54.800]  I bet it's not.
