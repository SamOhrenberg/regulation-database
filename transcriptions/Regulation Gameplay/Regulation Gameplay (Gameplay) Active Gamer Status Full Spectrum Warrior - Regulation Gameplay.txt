[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  Blast off all the way back to 2004, where we are playing the biggest game of that year, undeniably.
[00:08.640 --> 00:10.080]  Everyone's talking about it.
[00:10.380 --> 00:15.300]  Everyone is excited for full Spectrum Warrior. Has anyone played this?
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.060]  I feel like I probably played a little bit of it, but I have no memory of it.
[00:20.300 --> 00:26.760]  But you know, there's a world where this game came out and was a hit, and instead of like 300 Call of Duties,
[00:26.760 --> 00:33.660]  we have three studios cranking out a new full Spectrum Warrior clone like every 11 months.
[00:34.900 --> 00:38.360]  It's like full Spectrum Warrior, Modern Warrior, Advanced Warrior.
[00:39.940 --> 00:47.940]  Ultra Spectrum Warrior, Space Spectrum Warrior. Now, I will say, as an active gamer myself, I'm very into this. Thank you, Andrew.
[00:48.780 --> 00:49.680]  Of course.
[00:50.800 --> 00:53.800]  I'm gonna guess ACC's accept. Oh, difficulty...
[00:54.720 --> 00:55.680]  Sergeant Major.
[00:57.620 --> 01:00.500]  You only get two? It's only two. Wow.
[01:01.580 --> 01:05.060]  Sergeant Major? I guess I'm Sergeant Major according to Gavin.
[01:06.360 --> 01:07.060]  Like the sergeant.
[01:08.760 --> 01:13.900]  Oh, we gotta see what the extra content is. What is this, your obsession? We don't even play the game.
[01:14.520 --> 01:16.380]  Oh shit, Punishment Trailer?
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.280]  Oh my god. Oh, oh, it's the game. Oh, this is good.
[01:22.280 --> 01:30.500]  This is... So did I. What I'm learning about playing games with Andrew is that he's a bonus content guy. I love bonus content.
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.160]  Because this exists.
[01:34.760 --> 01:42.800]  Well, and now we're playing the Punisher game next. Oh, I want to play the Punisher game. Is the Punisher a full Spectrum Warrior?
[01:44.000 --> 01:44.720]  I think he is.
[01:45.040 --> 01:50.920]  Oh, this is the one that has all the torture shit, right? Yeah, yeah.
[01:52.280 --> 01:55.760]  I have never seen anybody get ladder stabbed. Is that Sean McClane?
[01:56.820 --> 01:57.860]  Take that die hard.
[01:59.840 --> 02:01.800]  More like gone McClane.
[02:05.740 --> 02:11.380]  It's better than the last one. Oh for sure. No, thank you. It's better than anybody. What a trailer. It was a PS2 game?
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.160]  Oh, it's a Volition game.
[02:14.020 --> 02:18.820]  That's right, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, oh no.
[02:19.100 --> 02:21.940]  Put that in the hopper for a future...
[02:22.500 --> 02:22.980]  ...gameplay.
[02:23.960 --> 02:26.520]  Why? Why can't I play a solo campaign?
[02:27.720 --> 02:30.260]  What do you mean? You gotta do the mount course first.
[02:30.260 --> 02:30.600]  Yeah, you have to do the mount course.
[02:30.980 --> 02:31.460]  Okay.
[02:33.940 --> 02:36.800]  Oh, that implies there will be multiple mount training.
[02:37.180 --> 02:38.960]  Do you guys know what mount stands for?
[02:39.900 --> 02:46.600]  No. No, you do. What is it? Yeah, it stands for military operations under urban terrain. Oh, interesting.
[02:46.900 --> 02:51.920]  So the training you're about to do is gonna be like, it's gonna be like clearing buildings and shit.
[02:52.280 --> 02:54.060]  Is it like the goat in Fallout?
[02:54.500 --> 02:56.200]  Oh, man. Hang on.
[02:56.880 --> 02:57.320]  Sure.
[02:57.680 --> 02:59.460]  What kind of game is this?
[03:00.660 --> 03:01.880]  I don't know.
[03:02.200 --> 03:04.120]  Looks fun. Oh! No, it doesn't.
[03:04.340 --> 03:06.220]  Oh! Look at all these birds.
[03:06.260 --> 03:09.180]  I definitely played this game. I remember that shit.
[03:10.280 --> 03:12.300]  You have to like, command your...
[03:12.300 --> 03:13.780]  You have to like, command your guys?
[03:13.900 --> 03:15.500]  Yes. Is that what it is? Yes. Yes.
[03:15.620 --> 03:16.200]  Oh my god.
[03:18.320 --> 03:20.060]  No, I think it's com... What is this?
[03:20.060 --> 03:21.140]  Is it a strategy?
[03:21.720 --> 03:24.260]  It's... It's what... Yeah, it's SOCOM. It's like SOCOM, right?
[03:24.260 --> 03:25.600]  SOCOM. Yeah.
[03:27.980 --> 03:28.860]  This sucks.
[03:29.380 --> 03:31.100]  Well, hold on. No!
[03:31.160 --> 03:31.800]  We don't know yet.
[03:33.480 --> 03:35.860]  Oh, never mind. We do know.
[03:36.260 --> 03:37.960]  I wanted Andrew to be an active gamer
[03:37.960 --> 03:39.300]  who went full spectrum warrior.
[03:39.580 --> 03:41.240]  And now he has to command a team.
[03:41.940 --> 03:45.060]  Yeah, I definitely played this game.
[03:47.020 --> 03:47.960]  I think it...
[03:47.960 --> 03:49.100]  I think it might...
[03:49.100 --> 03:50.020]  Just let me play.
[03:50.360 --> 03:51.740]  What was your score on the mount?
[03:53.660 --> 03:54.720]  I don't remember.
[03:55.540 --> 03:56.720]  I had to fucking...
[03:56.720 --> 03:59.080]  I beat it in 25 seconds on veteran.
[04:00.040 --> 04:00.660]  To get the achievement.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.580]  Gavin, do you like this?
[04:05.180 --> 04:06.820]  What kind of question is that?
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.680]  I believe it's loaded.
[04:14.360 --> 04:17.140]  You can't just throw around a question like that.
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.140]  It could go off.
[04:22.940 --> 04:24.780]  Why are we doing this again?
[04:25.400 --> 04:25.480]  It's dangerous.
[04:35.060 --> 04:37.780]  Is the game gonna play or what?
[04:38.360 --> 04:39.980]  We're missing the lore.
[04:44.960 --> 04:47.180]  It's gonna be so much sadder
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.940]  when Private Silverman dies
[04:48.940 --> 04:50.500]  because we learned his backstory.
[04:52.660 --> 04:54.680]  I've noticed that a lot of these old game
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.000]  play videos we keep doing
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.720]  involve a lot of Andrew going...
[04:58.860 --> 05:00.220]  Just let me play.
[05:00.860 --> 05:01.960]  Check to see what the game is.
[05:02.020 --> 05:03.860]  You just heard full spectrum warrior.
[05:04.080 --> 05:05.100]  He's like, let's get a rock.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.920]  Look at my neck.
[05:07.240 --> 05:09.500]  It shouldn't bend that way.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.920]  Look at the skin.
[05:11.920 --> 05:13.300]  Oh my god.
[05:13.740 --> 05:15.740]  Is the guy up on that water tower thing
[05:15.740 --> 05:16.600]  talking to you?
[05:16.700 --> 05:19.600]  Oh, he is.
[05:20.140 --> 05:21.400]  They gave him an animation.
[05:21.580 --> 05:22.260]  They animated him.
[05:22.440 --> 05:24.740]  I wish to Christ they would let you do it.
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.540]  His hands are so big.
[05:28.460 --> 05:29.480]  Y'all hear that?
[05:29.540 --> 05:30.920]  The DS has two screens.
[05:34.940 --> 05:38.660]  What am I doing?
[05:38.660 --> 05:39.620]  What's that over there?
[05:40.680 --> 05:42.280]  Everybody look west.
[05:43.420 --> 05:45.300]  Oh shit, there's a battalion of crows.
[05:45.440 --> 05:46.060]  Get them.
[05:47.080 --> 05:47.640]  Get them.
[05:48.520 --> 05:49.820]  Switch to the crows.
[05:52.720 --> 05:54.680]  And there's a crow on a different
[05:54.680 --> 05:56.360]  water tower just going...
[06:00.380 --> 06:01.700]  This is Overwatch.
[06:09.080 --> 06:10.860]  There's a certain kind of person
[06:10.860 --> 06:11.960]  that likes this game.
[06:12.020 --> 06:12.620]  No.
[06:14.640 --> 06:16.600]  There isn't a person
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.320]  alive in 2024
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.660]  that wants to go through a
[06:20.660 --> 06:22.700]  tutorial where you don't get
[06:22.700 --> 06:24.140]  to play the tutorial
[06:24.600 --> 06:26.080]  for 15 minutes.
[06:26.240 --> 06:26.720]  I disagree.
[06:26.900 --> 06:30.300]  I think there are some full spectrum warriors
[06:30.300 --> 06:31.620]  out there who love this shit.
[06:32.420 --> 06:34.580]  This might have been a good game
[06:34.580 --> 06:36.320]  but nobody would know
[06:36.320 --> 06:38.160]  because nobody's gonna make it
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.040]  past the tutorial.
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.060]  Of all 8 billion people on the Earth,
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.320]  how many did the
[06:44.320 --> 06:45.760]  moat today? Or the mout?
[06:47.140 --> 06:48.320]  What are we...
[06:49.520 --> 06:50.500]  What am I doing?
[06:50.800 --> 06:52.580]  Just find the sniper.
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.440]  No, I just
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.280]  can't hear them.
[06:55.320 --> 06:57.420]  Follow the blue arrow.
[06:57.940 --> 06:59.300]  Is the blue arrow not pointing to anything?
[07:03.700 --> 07:04.820]  Look up!
[07:04.820 --> 07:05.700]  Look up, goddammit.
[07:05.760 --> 07:09.100]  I don't know what was confusing
[07:09.100 --> 07:09.620]  about that.
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.700]  We didn't hear a word he
[07:12.700 --> 07:14.660]  fucking said and we all knew what he wanted.
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.800]  The crow spectrum warrior got it
[07:16.800 --> 07:17.220]  first try.
[07:22.500 --> 07:24.440]  You're looking at the tops of the trees
[07:24.440 --> 07:26.380]  for the sniper instead of the building.
[07:28.940 --> 07:29.900]  Iron Man!
[07:30.140 --> 07:31.560]  Sergeant Iron Man Mendez.
[07:32.020 --> 07:33.080]  What are the other nicknames?
[07:33.740 --> 07:35.660]  Okay, don't let me do the thing you taught me to do.
[07:35.900 --> 07:36.200]  Cool.
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.140]  I just wanna play this video game.
[07:40.300 --> 07:41.580]  Should we look up a cheat for the
[07:41.580 --> 07:42.080]  first level?
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.100]  Yeah, look it up, Gavin.
[07:45.080 --> 07:47.240]  Oh, what button?
[07:47.580 --> 07:49.200]  My controller doesn't have that button!
[07:49.480 --> 07:50.820]  You know the black button? There you go.
[07:51.720 --> 07:51.860]  Okay.
[07:53.480 --> 07:55.020]  Oh shit, it is the DS.
[07:55.260 --> 07:57.320]  As somebody who was an active gamer in 2004,
[07:57.500 --> 07:59.520]  I don't know how the fuck I made it to continue
[07:59.520 --> 08:00.660]  to be a gamer in 2014.
[08:01.700 --> 08:02.980]  This was a trying time.
[08:05.620 --> 08:07.640]  Yeah, dude, it's gotta be like hyper-realistic.
[08:07.820 --> 08:09.140]  Oh, cool. Yeah, is it fun?
[08:09.280 --> 08:09.560]  No.
[08:12.140 --> 08:13.260]  What's the gameplay like?
[08:13.340 --> 08:15.840]  Well, we don't know yet. Nobody's made it far enough in to get there.
[08:17.900 --> 08:18.760]  Fire and move.
[08:19.580 --> 08:21.260]  I would argue that the name of the game
[08:21.260 --> 08:23.000]  is not fire and move, it is
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.280]  stand still and listen.
[08:26.820 --> 08:28.240]  This is a game
[08:28.240 --> 08:29.660]  for guys
[08:29.660 --> 08:30.780]  who work in IT
[08:30.780 --> 08:33.680]  who didn't serve in the military
[08:33.680 --> 08:36.280]  but will treat you
[08:36.280 --> 08:37.440]  like they did.
[08:38.320 --> 08:40.160]  This is a game that somehow skipped
[08:40.160 --> 08:41.980]  doing every focus group.
[08:42.600 --> 08:44.100]  This is a game
[08:44.100 --> 08:45.480]  that so isn't a game.
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.200]  I invented my own game
[08:47.200 --> 08:48.800]  a little while ago that I've been playing
[08:48.800 --> 08:50.820]  where I look at the letters on the left
[08:50.820 --> 08:52.980]  and I try to find words like rat
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.180]  or tar
[08:54.180 --> 08:55.320]  or lag
[08:59.420 --> 09:00.300]  tag
[09:03.280 --> 09:04.160]  rag
[09:05.760 --> 09:06.640]  log
[09:07.640 --> 09:08.800]  I wish
[09:08.800 --> 09:10.620]  garg was a word.
[09:10.760 --> 09:13.260]  I feel like garg should be a word now.
[09:13.260 --> 09:14.140]  Garg?
[09:15.160 --> 09:16.040]  Garg?
[09:16.500 --> 09:17.880]  G-A-R-G?
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.280]  Gargle.
[09:19.280 --> 09:20.620]  Oh, gargle.
[09:20.760 --> 09:23.020]  I feel like garg is the noise you
[09:23.020 --> 09:25.260]  involuntarily make when you get stuck in this
[09:25.260 --> 09:25.740]  tutorial.
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.740]  People honestly thought
[09:39.320 --> 09:41.440]  you'd want to stand and listen for the first
[09:41.440 --> 09:42.380]  ten minutes of a game.
[09:43.020 --> 09:44.380]  This is crazy.
[09:45.260 --> 09:46.340]  Can you imagine renting this?
[09:46.660 --> 09:48.360]  Could you imagine getting this at midnight?
[09:48.360 --> 09:49.400]  Oh my god.
[09:50.880 --> 09:52.360]  Sure as shit wouldn't be planned
[09:52.360 --> 09:54.140]  until 25 past 12.
[09:56.600 --> 09:58.340]  This definitely wasn't in the E3
[09:58.340 --> 09:59.060]  conference.
[10:00.280 --> 10:02.360]  It was. No, this part.
[10:03.340 --> 10:04.260]  They definitely
[10:04.260 --> 10:05.860]  fast forwarded some action bits.
[10:08.420 --> 10:10.520]  You don't think they showed the shield icons
[10:10.520 --> 10:11.260]  above their heads?
[10:14.120 --> 10:16.260]  He ran away and you won or what?
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.780]  I was really hoping I could skip this.
[10:21.860 --> 10:22.740]  Yeah, fucking right.
[10:26.510 --> 10:26.950]  Go!
[10:30.930 --> 10:31.370]  Okay.
[10:31.630 --> 10:33.290]  Oh cool, it became the sims.
[10:34.670 --> 10:35.470]  Taking fire!
[10:38.610 --> 10:40.190]  That guy's got some guts.
[10:41.710 --> 10:42.870]  He's reloading! Shoot him!
[10:43.490 --> 10:45.070]  Move to the corner. No, we gotta move to the corner.
[10:46.470 --> 10:47.350]  Run away!
[10:47.350 --> 10:47.470]  Run away!
[10:51.880 --> 10:53.240]  I feel like I'm half
[10:53.240 --> 10:55.040]  out the wall. Yeah.
[10:55.500 --> 10:56.580]  I'm so exposed.
[10:56.900 --> 10:58.600]  This is what Gears of War should have been.
[11:00.620 --> 11:01.500]  Oh god.
[11:02.640 --> 11:03.460]  Tactically use your
[11:03.460 --> 11:04.080]  chainsaw gun.
[11:06.220 --> 11:07.360]  Gavin, you and I
[11:07.360 --> 11:08.980]  gotta finish those achievements in Gears 2.
[11:10.540 --> 11:11.200]  Can we not get ammo?
[11:11.340 --> 11:13.240]  Which ones do you guys need? Can we watch you
[11:13.240 --> 11:14.580]  do that instead of this?
[11:15.060 --> 11:15.640]  What the?
[11:17.360 --> 11:18.540]  He shot the door open.
[11:19.640 --> 11:20.620]  I'm gonna still
[11:20.620 --> 11:22.560]  find Hexic HD and get that achievement
[11:22.560 --> 11:23.640]  I'm missing. You should.
[11:24.600 --> 11:26.580]  I like that you're just chasing
[11:26.580 --> 11:27.160]  this guy.
[11:28.780 --> 11:30.580]  What do you mean incorrect positioning?
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.720]  Let it light up green. It's not lined up.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.800]  Yeah. Yeah, why don't you get it right?
[11:35.360 --> 11:36.560]  Yeah, come on. Put the
[11:36.560 --> 11:38.660]  yellow in the yellow, dude. You gotta put your yellow
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.460]  in that yellow. Yeah, yellow and yellow
[11:40.460 --> 11:42.080]  make green. Are you colorblind?
[11:42.480 --> 11:42.860]  Yeah.
[11:43.900 --> 11:44.880]  Why are you doing that?
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.980]  I'm not doing anything.
[11:48.040 --> 11:48.960]  This makes me want to play.
[11:49.640 --> 11:51.280]  It's lined up green. Yeah, it's green.
[11:51.500 --> 11:52.120]  That's so hard, dude.
[11:54.320 --> 11:56.200]  We believed in you, we just don't know how you did that.
[11:56.220 --> 11:57.780]  I would rather play Rogue Agent.
[11:58.520 --> 11:59.540]  Yeah, that game was awesome.
[12:00.400 --> 12:01.840]  You shoot people and that's enough.
[12:02.380 --> 12:04.060]  The kill count was already 100 at this
[12:04.060 --> 12:04.760]  point in that game.
[12:07.240 --> 12:08.000]  Stop chasing
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.060]  this guy.
[12:09.060 --> 12:10.420]  Hey, don't
[12:10.420 --> 12:12.900]  chuck all the graphics away. This game has put
[12:12.900 --> 12:14.100]  the circle in the circle.
[12:14.240 --> 12:15.300]  It is.
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.160]  I hate this part too, I agree.
[12:20.540 --> 12:21.180]  Look at
[12:21.180 --> 12:22.880]  those fingers on that
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.500]  gun barrel.
[12:24.680 --> 12:25.460]  So now what?
[12:28.320 --> 12:29.840]  His hands are so big.
[12:31.340 --> 12:32.920]  Is it resting
[12:32.920 --> 12:34.040]  on his index finger?
[12:35.240 --> 12:36.980]  Oh my god, I can't
[12:36.980 --> 12:38.040]  go through objects.
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.420]  There you go.
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.440]  Line it up, warrior.
[12:49.440 --> 12:50.040]  Trolls.
[12:51.820 --> 12:52.720]  You're gonna invert
[12:52.720 --> 12:54.280]  the X axis?
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.880]  Now it's not
[12:56.880 --> 12:57.360]  inverted.
[12:59.420 --> 13:00.620]  It was...
[13:00.620 --> 13:02.180]  You guys are gonna have to shoot this dude eventually.
[13:03.080 --> 13:04.880]  I'd imagine standing in a line
[13:04.880 --> 13:06.920]  of fire right now, you probably shouldn't shoot him.
[13:10.540 --> 13:12.300]  Nope, you gotta take cover.
[13:13.740 --> 13:14.740]  There it is.
[13:19.360 --> 13:20.420]  This is...
[13:20.420 --> 13:21.200]  I don't...
[13:21.200 --> 13:23.220]  I hate this.
[13:23.480 --> 13:26.000]  How long has this genuinely been going?
[13:26.440 --> 13:27.200]  How long have I been doing this?
[13:27.400 --> 13:28.420]  15 minutes?
[13:29.400 --> 13:30.800]  Oh my god!
[13:30.820 --> 13:32.940]  It feels like a day.
[13:34.080 --> 13:34.520]  Oh...
[13:34.520 --> 13:37.120]  I just wanna do some
[13:37.120 --> 13:37.800]  warrioring.
[13:38.140 --> 13:39.720]  This is utter torture.
[13:41.060 --> 13:43.000]  Is this the first video we record
[13:43.000 --> 13:43.960]  that we don't put out?
[13:45.040 --> 13:46.480]  No, I think we gotta say it.
[13:46.480 --> 13:47.380]  People gotta know.
[13:51.040 --> 13:52.520]  I'm ready to leave!
[13:53.440 --> 13:54.820]  There are going to be people that
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.520]  leave comments on this that are like,
[13:56.660 --> 13:58.960]  these guys are too harsh on this game, this game is actually
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.880]  really good, I remember playing this with my friends
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.600]  and this was actually like so much fun
[14:02.600 --> 14:03.960]  and it's like, no, this sucks.
[14:05.220 --> 14:05.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:06.560 --> 14:08.440]  They kept talking over it.
[14:09.400 --> 14:10.780]  Let's give it a full chance then.
[14:11.360 --> 14:11.680]  Alright.
[14:13.320 --> 14:14.940]  We're gonna be silent.
[14:15.520 --> 14:16.240]  Okay, we're locked in.
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.400]  Okay, locked in on fun.
[14:18.980 --> 14:20.980]  We're getting out of the tutorial, so maybe
[14:20.980 --> 14:22.320]  this is where the fun will begin.
[14:23.340 --> 14:23.720]  Crows!
[14:23.840 --> 14:26.500]  I went too far.
[14:27.280 --> 14:27.980]  You gotta go back.
[14:27.980 --> 14:28.300]  Sorry.
[14:30.480 --> 14:30.840]  Objective.
[14:31.540 --> 14:31.760]  Yay!
[14:34.300 --> 14:35.840]  The second we locked in,
[14:35.980 --> 14:38.140]  he beat the level. Maybe we should've locked in a while ago.
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.460]  Yeah, we just need to lock in, guys.
[14:41.080 --> 14:41.440]  Alright.
[14:41.980 --> 14:43.080]  Can I play the game now?
[14:43.500 --> 14:45.260]  Well, we're gonna have a cutscene explaining what we're doing.
[14:45.760 --> 14:47.180]  Yeah, we're having fun. That's what you think.
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.400]  Oh no, we're just guarding right in.
[14:53.450 --> 14:54.170]  I always
[14:54.170 --> 14:54.870]  maintain unity.
[14:57.110 --> 14:57.470]  No!
[14:57.470 --> 14:57.670]  No!
[14:59.210 --> 15:00.630]  This is more tutorial.
[15:01.490 --> 15:01.890]  No!
[15:02.690 --> 15:04.770]  But we knew it was more tutorial, because when he started
[15:04.770 --> 15:07.290]  it was mount one, and you knew there was gonna be like three.
[15:07.310 --> 15:07.710]  No!
[15:08.490 --> 15:10.070]  Everybody, let's go ahead and lock in.
[15:10.730 --> 15:11.330]  We're locked in.
[15:12.250 --> 15:15.210]  Geoff, I'm locked in.
[15:16.530 --> 15:17.810]  I'm gonna be bravo team now.
[15:17.930 --> 15:18.170]  Nope.
[15:18.930 --> 15:19.470]  Won't let me.
[15:21.550 --> 15:22.790]  That's not locked in, Gavin!
[15:23.370 --> 15:25.430]  Hold on, I have an unlock all chapters
[15:25.430 --> 15:26.490]  cheat code.
[15:26.990 --> 15:27.970]  Please.
[15:29.470 --> 15:31.230]  Let's unlock for that.
[15:33.190 --> 15:35.490]  How close to the
[15:35.490 --> 15:37.530]  Is there any way
[15:37.530 --> 15:39.130]  to find out how far into the fucking
[15:39.130 --> 15:40.550]  tutorial we are?
[15:42.410 --> 15:45.010]  They really hate doors.
[15:47.570 --> 15:49.790]  Just kill anyone.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.420]  Understood.
[15:57.920 --> 15:59.100]  Here we go.
[16:00.540 --> 16:01.160]  Oh my
[16:01.160 --> 16:01.740]  god.
[16:03.420 --> 16:05.140]  Can James Bond die now?
[16:05.560 --> 16:07.360]  It is put the circle in the circle, Gavin.
[16:08.400 --> 16:09.360]  It is put the circle
[16:09.360 --> 16:11.020]  in the circle. Rain down hell!
[16:13.380 --> 16:15.020]  He's dead. That's what happens when they die.
[16:15.940 --> 16:16.240]  Yeah.
[16:17.100 --> 16:18.200]  Ah, you got me.
[16:19.240 --> 16:21.200]  Walking away. Country's all yours.
[16:21.600 --> 16:22.620]  I'll just be on my way.
[16:32.450 --> 16:33.490]  Oh shit.
[16:33.630 --> 16:34.590]  Oh shit.
[16:35.170 --> 16:36.190]  Someone's flanking.
[16:38.910 --> 16:39.630]  I'm sorry.
[16:39.710 --> 16:41.390]  I didn't know that Bob already
[16:41.750 --> 16:43.010]  conceded the country to you.
[16:43.670 --> 16:44.790]  Sorry about that.
[16:45.330 --> 16:46.270]  Let me walk back.
[16:47.190 --> 16:48.930]  Sorry, I was going to the bathroom.
[16:49.090 --> 16:50.470]  I missed the country thing.
[16:52.170 --> 16:53.730]  Hey Bob, wait up!
[17:00.270 --> 17:02.110]  I feel like this is
[17:02.110 --> 17:04.190]  every Airsoft dude's fantasy.
[17:04.370 --> 17:05.670]  100%
[17:06.310 --> 17:07.950]  This is what they want.
[17:15.310 --> 17:17.370]  I'm trying, but you won't let me.
[17:24.080 --> 17:26.240]  Hey, we're seeing
[17:26.240 --> 17:27.780]  the other side of the coin now, guys.
[17:28.980 --> 17:30.280]  Now we're seeing their
[17:30.280 --> 17:30.860]  perspective.
[17:33.980 --> 17:36.020]  One that Geoff doesn't actually own.
[17:37.180 --> 17:38.140]  The one that no
[17:38.140 --> 17:40.440]  matter which side comes up, it puts you to sleep.
[17:43.680 --> 17:44.120]  B.
[17:47.980 --> 17:48.420]  Yeah.
[17:49.700 --> 17:50.560]  Grenade his ass.
[17:51.580 --> 17:52.740]  Go ahead and lock in.
[17:53.480 --> 17:54.380]  I'm locking in.
[17:54.920 --> 17:56.280]  Dude, you gotta lock in.
[17:56.820 --> 17:59.140]  I want to use my hands instead of my ears.
[18:00.440 --> 18:01.280]  Okay, left.
[18:01.500 --> 18:02.800]  Hit the button that we don't have anymore.
[18:04.320 --> 18:05.380]  Yeah, it's right bumper.
[18:11.040 --> 18:11.700]  Oh no.
[18:11.780 --> 18:12.920]  Oh no, are we going to have to send Bravo
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.560]  all the way around?
[18:27.630 --> 18:29.670]  Just let me play your game.
[18:31.230 --> 18:33.710]  I'm not sure what you think the game is going to be
[18:33.710 --> 18:34.730]  when you start playing it.
[18:34.750 --> 18:38.350]  There was one dude on the development team
[18:39.110 --> 18:40.190]  Everybody's playing and he goes
[18:40.190 --> 18:42.330]  Guys, can I just ask one
[18:42.330 --> 18:43.910]  question. Is it
[18:43.910 --> 18:44.690]  fun?
[18:46.530 --> 18:48.250]  Everybody looks at him and is like, what the fuck
[18:48.250 --> 18:49.710]  are you talking about? Of course it's fun.
[18:50.050 --> 18:50.970]  And the one guy's like
[18:50.970 --> 18:52.950]  I don't know.
[18:54.270 --> 18:55.790]  What do you want from me?
[18:56.210 --> 18:57.350]  What button is this?
[18:57.970 --> 19:00.270]  L. What button is this?
[19:01.050 --> 19:01.810]  Press L.
[19:02.390 --> 19:03.170]  L down.
[19:05.950 --> 19:07.350]  What is L down?
[19:10.410 --> 19:10.850]  Wow.
[19:12.410 --> 19:13.190]  Is it the left stick?
[19:13.890 --> 19:14.610]  Is it the left stick?
[19:15.250 --> 19:16.370]  No. Okay.
[19:18.430 --> 19:19.150]  Okay, no.
[19:19.330 --> 19:21.090]  Maybe it's because you inverted everything. It's really
[19:21.090 --> 19:21.530]  off.
[19:24.590 --> 19:25.290]  I didn't think
[19:25.290 --> 19:25.710]  about that.
[19:30.020 --> 19:31.300]  I would love it if
[19:31.300 --> 19:33.140]  the game is so shitty it lets you
[19:33.140 --> 19:34.840]  invert the controls but doesn't
[19:34.840 --> 19:35.980]  invert the instructions.
[19:40.220 --> 19:42.240]  Oh, I gotta keep moving?
[19:42.960 --> 19:50.480]  Ah, just go.
[19:52.380 --> 19:54.480]  Now I gotta go down here, I bet you.
[19:54.820 --> 19:56.860]  Just let me run the whole way.
[19:57.220 --> 19:58.720]  Don't make me run in these little
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.780]  chunks. I know I
[20:00.780 --> 20:01.840]  have to go around.
[20:01.840 --> 20:03.820]  Why are we moving halfway?
[20:04.160 --> 20:05.620]  It's all about moving fire.
[20:06.060 --> 20:07.300]  It's not just move.
[20:13.800 --> 20:15.760]  This is how it is in the military,
[20:16.080 --> 20:17.560]  Andrew. They're strict.
[20:18.100 --> 20:19.540]  And you need to be strict.
[20:20.060 --> 20:21.220]  Yeah, come on, Andrew.
[20:21.420 --> 20:24.060]  This is just like the real
[20:24.060 --> 20:24.680]  military.
[20:33.080 --> 20:33.580]  Okay.
[20:34.560 --> 20:35.060]  No!
[20:37.200 --> 20:37.700]  No!
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.480]  Not another course!
[20:42.040 --> 20:43.680]  Yeah, we gotta do the cheat code to at least play
[20:43.680 --> 20:46.060]  one level because we're 20 minutes in.
[20:47.740 --> 20:49.840]  We're so close after the next course
[20:49.840 --> 20:50.220]  we're done!
[20:50.320 --> 20:53.800]  There can't be another course after the grenade
[20:53.800 --> 20:54.160]  course.
[20:54.160 --> 20:54.960]  That's a good point.
[20:55.180 --> 21:02.260]  I don't need you to
[21:02.260 --> 21:04.140]  recap what I just learned. I appreciate
[21:04.140 --> 21:05.980]  it. I just learned it. Previously
[21:05.980 --> 21:07.400]  on Full Spectrum War.
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.340]  Oh, this is gonna go so fast.
[21:17.480 --> 21:18.220]  Yeah, this is
[21:18.220 --> 21:19.060]  gonna be the easiest one.
[21:20.800 --> 21:22.180]  Go ahead and lock in.
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.220]  Okay, locked in.
[21:25.580 --> 21:26.580]  Yeah, they do.
[21:28.340 --> 21:29.320]  Don't waste them.
[21:31.320 --> 21:31.840]  What?
[21:34.640 --> 21:35.160]  Okay.
[21:36.840 --> 21:37.880]  Press hold.
[21:38.400 --> 21:40.380]  Oh, this is fun.
[21:40.400 --> 21:41.780]  That's the coolest thing that's happened yet.
[21:43.560 --> 21:44.220]  There's no
[21:44.220 --> 21:45.340]  circles here, I like it.
[21:46.620 --> 21:47.340]  Oh, yeah.
[21:47.940 --> 21:49.020]  Throw it on Glog.
[21:53.190 --> 21:53.790]  Oh, yeah.
[21:53.910 --> 21:54.770]  It sure does.
[21:56.350 --> 21:56.830]  Okay.
[22:15.870 --> 22:16.910]  What if I
[22:16.910 --> 22:17.790]  mess it off the wall?
[22:17.790 --> 22:19.930]  You tripped shot it.
[22:21.950 --> 22:22.950]  Tripped shot.
[22:29.970 --> 22:32.290]  Any birds I can throw this at?
[22:32.850 --> 22:33.750]  Where are those crows?
[22:37.390 --> 22:39.310]  Let's actually beat this thing.
[22:43.630 --> 22:44.530]  Not even close.
[22:44.690 --> 22:45.350]  Oh, wow.
[22:53.220 --> 22:53.520]  Oh.
[22:55.760 --> 22:56.840]  Sometimes you can do that.
[22:57.580 --> 22:59.200]  Sometimes you just do it right between the two.
[22:59.280 --> 23:01.520]  I mean, I feel like they're pretty far apart. That's pretty wide range.
[23:02.220 --> 23:03.540]  Interesting gravity on this planet.
[23:03.800 --> 23:04.120]  Yeah.
[23:06.600 --> 23:06.960]  Wow.
[23:07.720 --> 23:09.400]  The range on that is insane.
[23:10.200 --> 23:11.040]  Yeah, that was ridiculous.
[23:14.440 --> 23:15.040]  What do you mean?
[23:17.720 --> 23:18.080]  What?
[23:19.920 --> 23:20.900]  Did you mess it up?
[23:20.900 --> 23:22.820]  I don't know.
[23:30.030 --> 23:31.480]  You gotta hold X.
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.760]  It's just using words
[23:41.760 --> 23:43.640]  like correspond. It's just
[23:43.640 --> 23:45.000]  not for me.
[23:47.290 --> 23:49.000]  It's not corresponding in my brain.
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.600]  Hit him. Over the left.
[23:55.900 --> 23:56.560]  Look at that.
[23:57.140 --> 23:57.980]  Let's get him.
[23:59.020 --> 24:00.180]  Do it. Put the circle in the circle.
[24:00.640 --> 24:01.260]  Do it.
[24:01.840 --> 24:02.620]  I'm doing it.
[24:03.380 --> 24:05.100]  It won't let me.
[24:09.390 --> 24:10.210]  What are we doing?
[24:10.730 --> 24:11.130]  Do it.
[24:11.930 --> 24:13.370]  I'm trying. I did it.
[24:17.210 --> 24:17.650]  Fire.
[24:18.030 --> 24:18.930]  Maybe you gotta do that.
[24:19.250 --> 24:20.730]  Maybe you gotta do that one first.
[24:22.730 --> 24:23.170]  Missed.
[24:24.270 --> 24:25.750]  How did he know it was negative kill
[24:25.750 --> 24:26.610]  before he shot it?
[24:26.890 --> 24:28.410]  There you go. Right there. Lower.
[24:30.510 --> 24:31.130]  Get him.
[24:33.390 --> 24:34.250]  Final kill.
[24:34.550 --> 24:37.030]  That was cool.
[24:37.490 --> 24:38.150]  That was pretty cool.
[24:44.450 --> 24:44.930]  No!
[24:46.810 --> 24:49.870]  I was under the impression that this one was the last one, Andrew.
[24:51.410 --> 24:53.190]  What else could we learn?
[24:53.190 --> 24:55.750]  I like that they make you walk over there
[24:55.750 --> 24:56.630]  to end the level.
[24:56.850 --> 24:58.250]  They're like, you can't end it here.
[25:00.410 --> 25:01.370]  It's not safe
[25:01.370 --> 25:01.950]  to end here.
[25:07.190 --> 25:08.670]  Okay, finally the game.
[25:09.310 --> 25:11.590]  I think they're just gonna let us play the game now.
[25:16.290 --> 25:16.770]  What?
[25:17.110 --> 25:18.210]  I thought it was over.
[25:21.510 --> 25:22.270]  Oh, okay.
[25:35.480 --> 25:36.860]  This will teach you guys.
[25:40.470 --> 25:40.950]  Yeah!
[25:42.870 --> 25:43.670]  Never see you
[25:43.670 --> 25:44.170]  coming, bud.
[25:46.830 --> 25:48.990]  And you won't see yourself going either.
[25:51.510 --> 25:53.690]  Oh, shit. Where am I supposed to go?
[25:54.130 --> 25:54.930]  Oh, fuck.
[25:55.330 --> 25:57.490]  Where's the box?
[26:00.990 --> 26:01.610]  Let's just
[26:01.610 --> 26:03.550]  go this way, guys. We'll figure it out.
[26:03.550 --> 26:04.590]  Oh, god.
[26:07.820 --> 26:09.040]  No, I wanna go.
[26:09.520 --> 26:11.580]  This is what all your shenanigans have brought.
[26:11.660 --> 26:12.140]  Oh, there you go.
[26:12.660 --> 26:21.120]  Oh, this sucks.
[26:21.960 --> 26:22.800]  Oh, man.
[26:24.520 --> 26:25.980]  You got a guy over there you gotta kill.
[26:26.260 --> 26:26.760]  Grenade launcher!
[26:30.460 --> 26:30.940]  Okay.
[26:32.080 --> 26:33.840]  Put my little circle over
[26:33.840 --> 26:35.800]  the smaller one.
[26:36.360 --> 26:36.980]  Oh!
[26:44.010 --> 26:44.630]  Yep.
[26:45.210 --> 26:47.090]  Easy. Got it. Bam.
[26:48.970 --> 26:49.770]  Throwing it.
[26:53.110 --> 26:53.910]  Oh, man.
[26:55.150 --> 26:57.190]  Do you think Bill Gates ever played Full Spectrum Warrior?
[26:59.950 --> 27:00.570]  No.
[27:01.090 --> 27:01.350]  No.
[27:02.770 --> 27:04.550]  Do you think that's where that guy met Ginny McCarthy?
[27:05.190 --> 27:06.310]  Xbox Live Games.
[27:06.430 --> 27:07.290]  Full Spectrum Warrior.
[27:07.730 --> 27:09.410]  I don't think anybody's played this.
[27:10.730 --> 27:12.490]  I'd love to see the percentage
[27:12.490 --> 27:14.110]  of people that made it through the tutorial.
[27:15.570 --> 27:16.690]  I bet it's more than you think
[27:16.690 --> 27:17.450]  for back then.
[27:18.550 --> 27:18.950]  Sure.
[27:19.930 --> 27:22.690]  I wish achievements exist so we can actually see that data.
[27:25.150 --> 27:26.710]  Nope. I went through it again.
[27:27.370 --> 27:27.610]  Okay.
[27:28.530 --> 27:30.570]  What is with the eyes in that font?
[27:31.770 --> 27:32.910]  Bugging the piss out of me.
[27:34.550 --> 27:35.630]  Full Spectrum Warrior
[27:35.630 --> 27:38.250]  has a generally favorable
[27:38.250 --> 27:39.970]  meta score on Metacritic.
[27:40.290 --> 27:42.410]  Which makes sense to me
[27:42.410 --> 27:44.510]  given who uses stuff
[27:44.510 --> 27:45.530]  like Metacritic
[27:46.250 --> 27:47.830]  and how they're friendly people.
[27:50.330 --> 27:50.890]  So
[27:52.250 --> 27:54.170]  is this more tutorial
[27:54.170 --> 27:55.970]  or is this a game? Yeah, absolutely. No, no, no.
[27:56.030 --> 27:56.630]  This is tutorial.
[27:58.230 --> 27:59.870]  Oh, God! That's a big bird.
[28:00.750 --> 28:01.830]  Slow bird, too.
[28:08.720 --> 28:10.500]  We're never gonna get to the field.
[28:12.120 --> 28:14.240]  How much of the audience do you think
[28:14.240 --> 28:15.620]  is still with us?
[28:16.280 --> 28:18.320]  No, they're gone. If you're still
[28:18.320 --> 28:20.320]  watching this far, you're a Full Spectrum
[28:20.320 --> 28:22.220]  Warrior. And I want to thank you.
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.980]  You're on the Full Spectrum Warrior.
[28:24.520 --> 28:26.120]  Should that be a tier on our Patreon?
[28:26.940 --> 28:27.780]  Oh, God.
[28:28.740 --> 28:30.120]  It's where we give them money.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.340]  So we're sorry, Patreon?
[28:34.180 --> 28:36.200]  Yes. These are some pretty sharp shadows
[28:36.200 --> 28:37.260]  for such a cloudy day.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.560]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[28:41.960 --> 28:44.180]  This could only be worse if when
[28:44.180 --> 28:46.240]  you bought the game, you had to give them your address
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.240]  and then they mailed you a manual you had
[28:48.240 --> 28:50.100]  to fill out while you did the tutorial.
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.180]  I'm holding it!
[28:56.740 --> 28:58.100]  I'm holding it!
[28:58.120 --> 28:58.980]  I don't think you are.
[29:00.240 --> 29:02.260]  It doesn't seem like you are.
[29:02.600 --> 29:03.820]  I wish you would.
[29:05.420 --> 29:05.860]  What?
[29:06.480 --> 29:08.200]  Gavin, thanks for looking up the cheat code, though.
[29:08.220 --> 29:09.060]  I appreciate that, man.
[29:09.600 --> 29:11.040]  There you go.
[29:11.600 --> 29:12.980]  Still got it.
[29:14.520 --> 29:14.960]  Move!
[29:16.380 --> 29:18.020]  I've got to watch the speed of this game.
[29:18.420 --> 29:20.160]  I want to see how fast someone did the mouse.
[29:22.540 --> 29:23.900]  This game sold nearly one million
[29:23.900 --> 29:25.080]  copies for Xbox and PC.
[29:25.860 --> 29:26.300]  Wow.
[29:28.120 --> 29:28.880]  Oh, shit.
[29:29.340 --> 29:30.740]  I'm holding it!
[29:34.060 --> 29:35.160]  Oh, my God.
[29:35.360 --> 29:36.080]  You've got to hold A, dude.
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.080]  I am holding it!
[29:38.180 --> 29:39.720]  I mean, it's not lighting up green. You can see that.
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.760]  Put the peg in the hole.
[29:43.900 --> 29:44.280]  Yes!
[29:44.680 --> 29:45.400]  You did it!
[29:45.860 --> 29:46.720]  It's not that hard.
[29:51.230 --> 29:52.750]  What do you mean the fire sector?
[29:53.650 --> 29:54.750]  You're never going to believe this.
[29:55.810 --> 29:57.830]  Full Spectrum Warrior was initially
[29:57.830 --> 29:59.750]  developed for the U.S. Army
[29:59.750 --> 30:01.870]  as a tool to help train
[30:01.870 --> 30:04.330]  soldiers for high-intensity urban combat.
[30:04.330 --> 30:05.130]  Of course.
[30:06.730 --> 30:08.730]  Don't get me out of the frag screen.
[30:09.150 --> 30:10.410]  What does the X button do?
[30:11.810 --> 30:12.770]  Use down
[30:12.770 --> 30:14.750]  on the D-pad. Use up on the D-pad.
[30:15.170 --> 30:15.570]  Use right.
[30:16.670 --> 30:18.150]  Aren't you paying attention, soldier?
[30:18.690 --> 30:19.990]  Oh, my God!
[30:21.410 --> 30:21.790]  Ah!
[30:22.850 --> 30:24.870]  Get me out of the screen!
[30:26.930 --> 30:27.710]  You've got to put it in the blue.
[30:27.710 --> 30:28.790]  It won't let me leave!
[30:30.430 --> 30:31.730]  Do I have to look west?
[30:31.730 --> 30:32.650]  Put it on the blue.
[30:34.650 --> 30:35.870]  It wants me to run
[30:35.870 --> 30:36.870]  to the blue, but I can't.
[30:38.130 --> 30:38.650]  Oh!
[30:41.130 --> 30:41.910]  I'm trying
[30:41.910 --> 30:42.410]  to bound,
[30:43.530 --> 30:45.550]  but every button is disabled.
[30:47.830 --> 30:49.430]  Oh, my God, I hate this.
[30:49.610 --> 30:50.850]  Okay, cheat codes.
[30:51.870 --> 30:53.150]  That's where you give up?
[30:53.890 --> 30:55.850]  Cheat codes. That's how far you got?
[30:56.570 --> 30:57.430]  Cheat codes.
[30:57.970 --> 30:59.370]  Okay, I got you some cheat codes.
[30:59.370 --> 31:00.530]  Give me one.
[31:00.650 --> 31:03.550]  This is a great one. Canadian Vision.
[31:09.100 --> 31:10.840]  What did that do?
[31:11.540 --> 31:13.160]  That puts all enemies
[31:13.160 --> 31:13.800]  on the GPS.
[31:14.580 --> 31:14.840]  Good.
[31:16.760 --> 31:17.700]  Now what?
[31:17.980 --> 31:19.200]  Are you ready?
[31:20.680 --> 31:22.220]  A pan papa.
[31:23.100 --> 31:23.480]  What?
[31:24.200 --> 31:25.680]  A-P-A-N.
[31:25.680 --> 31:27.060]  A-P-A-N.
[31:29.420 --> 31:30.440]  A pan.
[31:30.900 --> 31:33.800]  Are we ordering from Domino's?
[31:33.940 --> 31:34.300]  What's going on?
[31:34.680 --> 31:36.740]  P-A-P-A.
[31:39.500 --> 31:40.760]  A pan papa.
[31:41.380 --> 31:42.120]  Papa John!
[31:43.560 --> 31:43.900]  M.
[31:45.440 --> 31:47.320]  S-N. No, N.
[31:48.320 --> 31:49.560]  N-S-N, okay.
[31:50.180 --> 31:51.360]  N for Nunky.
[31:52.280 --> 31:53.240]  N-S-N.
[31:53.240 --> 31:53.820]  Yeah.
[31:55.060 --> 31:56.400]  A-L-E.
[31:58.160 --> 32:00.040]  Is this a lie?
[32:00.860 --> 32:01.600]  Nine.
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.460]  Nine? What the hell is that?
[32:07.440 --> 32:08.600]  I'm gonna jab him.
[32:09.160 --> 32:10.400]  A pan.
[32:10.640 --> 32:11.160]  A pan.
[32:11.160 --> 32:11.620]  A pan.
[32:16.660 --> 32:17.420]  Papa.
[32:20.280 --> 32:22.200]  N-S-N-A-L-9.
[32:22.660 --> 32:24.100]  What's wrong? Hold on.
[32:25.200 --> 32:26.800]  This is for the PS2.
[32:27.740 --> 32:28.640]  You idiot!
[32:31.560 --> 32:32.800]  Oh my god!
[32:32.940 --> 32:35.480]  I looked up a walkthrough on GameFAQs
[32:35.480 --> 32:36.760]  because we're in 2004.
[32:37.460 --> 32:39.300]  And if you guys want
[32:39.300 --> 32:41.180]  I can read what it says about the training area.
[32:41.780 --> 32:42.300]  Please.
[32:42.440 --> 32:44.700]  It says, this is the full walkthrough.
[32:46.200 --> 32:47.200]  Here we go.
[32:47.660 --> 32:49.460]  Welcome to Full Spectrum Warrior.
[32:51.600 --> 32:53.260]  Complete the mount training.
[32:55.420 --> 32:55.940]  Great.
[32:56.120 --> 32:58.580]  And then it says, chapter one.
[33:00.180 --> 33:01.080]  That's all it says.
[33:01.280 --> 33:02.500]  Complete mount training.
[33:02.720 --> 33:05.000]  Why did Canadian Vision work
[33:05.000 --> 33:05.820]  but a pan...
[33:05.820 --> 33:06.700]  I don't think it did.
[33:07.760 --> 33:09.300]  Well, it didn't say no, did it?
[33:10.020 --> 33:11.100]  It didn't say anything.
[33:12.220 --> 33:14.040]  What if it makes us start the mount training?
[33:14.060 --> 33:15.500]  Just give me the Xbox version.
[33:15.880 --> 33:17.600]  Okay, now it says Xbox version.
[33:18.260 --> 33:18.780]  A pan.
[33:19.440 --> 33:19.880]  Papan.
[33:21.760 --> 33:22.640]  Snail nine.
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.040]  That's the same thing.
[33:25.880 --> 33:26.760]  A pan.
[33:27.420 --> 33:29.420]  You said nail nine or snail nine.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.120]  Snail, but S-N-A-L-E.
[33:32.440 --> 33:33.080]  And then nine.
[33:33.760 --> 33:35.000]  Wow, it didn't work again?
[33:35.080 --> 33:36.740]  What are you doing?
[33:37.200 --> 33:39.480]  That's crazy. That's insane that we put in the same thing
[33:39.480 --> 33:40.740]  and it didn't work again.
[33:41.660 --> 33:42.680]  Well, let's try a different one.
[33:43.260 --> 33:43.720]  Swedish Army.
[33:45.840 --> 33:46.360]  Okay.
[33:47.180 --> 33:47.640]  Swedish Army.
[33:47.980 --> 33:48.520]  You have to clear.
[33:50.880 --> 33:52.540]  Oh my god.
[33:53.100 --> 33:54.340]  This has to be our first time.
[33:55.140 --> 33:57.320]  There's no way anyone's watching this.
[33:57.540 --> 33:59.440]  Swedish Army.
[34:00.520 --> 34:02.180]  I think this has to come out
[34:02.180 --> 34:03.520]  because this is going to go down
[34:03.520 --> 34:04.900]  in Regulation Infamy.
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.520]  We're going to be talking about this.
[34:07.060 --> 34:08.380]  I think that worked.
[34:09.120 --> 34:11.780]  You have to complete the mount
[34:11.780 --> 34:13.640]  to unlock
[34:13.640 --> 34:15.160]  a pan-papan snail.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.020]  There's no way.
[34:17.900 --> 34:19.500]  You've got to be spelling it wrong, right?
[34:20.300 --> 34:21.340]  Oh my god.
[34:22.160 --> 34:22.960]  I don't know.
[34:23.440 --> 34:23.500]  No!
[34:24.180 --> 34:25.100]  You've got to finish.
[34:25.100 --> 34:26.520]  You've got to finish, man.
[34:27.800 --> 34:29.120]  You've got to finish the mount.
[34:29.240 --> 34:30.280]  We're almost done.
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.740]  We're so close. We'd probably be done already
[34:32.740 --> 34:34.540]  if we had to pan-papan it for half an hour.
[34:34.980 --> 34:36.120]  It broke!
[34:37.700 --> 34:38.920]  If we had to pan-papan it.
[34:40.100 --> 34:41.260]  I don't think
[34:41.260 --> 34:43.020]  I've ever wanted to do anything less
[34:43.020 --> 34:43.620]  than this.
[34:44.280 --> 34:46.840]  I think this is the least I've ever
[34:46.840 --> 34:47.960]  wanted to do anything.
[34:48.180 --> 34:50.980]  This is the least fun I've ever had.
[34:51.280 --> 34:51.760]  Oh.
[34:52.840 --> 34:54.140]  Oh my god.
[34:54.680 --> 34:56.040]  What am I saying
[34:56.040 --> 34:57.860]  wrong with a pan-papan snail now?
[34:58.020 --> 34:58.380]  I don't know.
[35:01.220 --> 35:02.180]  This sucks
[35:02.180 --> 35:03.500]  so very much.
[35:07.080 --> 35:07.220]  Oh!
[35:09.900 --> 35:10.540]  Just
[35:10.540 --> 35:11.860]  let me move!
[35:13.700 --> 35:14.540]  Oh god
[35:14.540 --> 35:16.320]  in heaven. No one's watching
[35:16.320 --> 35:18.320]  this. We can say whatever
[35:18.320 --> 35:18.780]  we want.
[35:20.440 --> 35:20.660]  Oh!
[35:20.660 --> 35:21.140]  Oh!
[35:23.860 --> 35:24.660]  Yeah, that is
[35:24.660 --> 35:26.880]  true too. It's sort of a tree falls in the woods
[35:26.880 --> 35:28.720]  and nobody's there. Does anybody hear it?
[35:28.860 --> 35:30.820]  It doesn't matter if we hate this.
[35:30.860 --> 35:32.780]  Hey Geoff, the Lakers just fired their coach.
[35:33.260 --> 35:34.500]  No! Darvin Ham just got fired?
[35:34.960 --> 35:35.220]  Yeah.
[35:36.480 --> 35:38.400]  Finally some excitement. Wow.
[35:39.100 --> 35:40.740]  I'm glad that you felt something, Geoff.
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.620]  I missed that. I'm gonna google
[35:42.620 --> 35:44.040]  a pan-papan snail.
[35:44.820 --> 35:44.860]  Hahaha!
[35:47.220 --> 35:48.100]  God almighty!
[35:50.660 --> 35:52.240]  Man, Darvin Ham's had a rough couple years
[35:52.240 --> 35:53.220]  in the NBA. That sucks.
[35:53.440 --> 35:54.760]  How are we still talking?
[35:55.340 --> 35:57.860]  Do you guys see, while we're dating it,
[35:58.020 --> 36:00.200]  Eric, did you see Pat Beverley throw that basketball
[36:00.200 --> 36:02.040]  out on the floor? Oh yeah! That was awesome!
[36:02.960 --> 36:04.260]  All I saw was a bunch of people
[36:04.260 --> 36:06.080]  going, dude, he's not gonna be in the league next year.
[36:06.160 --> 36:07.540]  And I'm like, that guy's gonna be in a team.
[36:08.040 --> 36:09.620]  He'll be in the league, he's just not gonna
[36:10.160 --> 36:11.940]  play the first eight games of the season probably.
[36:12.080 --> 36:14.120]  Move! Oh, someone on Reddit.
[36:14.300 --> 36:15.920]  Unlock all chapters doesn't work for me.
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.620]  It says, incorrect cheat, try again.
[36:18.260 --> 36:18.660]  Oh.
[36:19.540 --> 36:21.780]  Do they have a solution to that problem?
[36:21.940 --> 36:23.940]  Sorry to say, I don't know what to do or
[36:23.940 --> 36:25.920]  say, other than double check what you enter.
[36:26.900 --> 36:27.220]  Hahaha!
[36:30.680 --> 36:31.080]  Andrew's
[36:31.080 --> 36:31.960]  already locked
[36:31.960 --> 36:33.920]  in. You can feel how locked in he is.
[36:34.120 --> 36:35.420]  Yeah, I'm locked in.
[36:37.040 --> 36:37.920]  I'm not gonna get
[36:37.920 --> 36:39.300]  broken by this fucking mound.
[36:40.520 --> 36:41.920]  By the way, if this is
[36:41.920 --> 36:43.220]  how we're training our soldiers
[36:43.220 --> 36:45.040]  in 2004,
[36:45.280 --> 36:47.040]  it's a wonder we made it as a country in
[36:47.040 --> 36:47.540]  2024.
[36:51.160 --> 36:53.500]  Okay. Okay. There we go.
[36:54.500 --> 36:55.360]  I got it.
[36:55.680 --> 36:57.440]  Look at the walk animation.
[36:58.000 --> 36:58.920]  No. It's
[36:58.920 --> 36:59.960]  terrible.
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.140]  Yeah, that's
[37:03.140 --> 37:04.320]  the only terrible thing.
[37:05.100 --> 37:06.040]  It is, yeah.
[37:07.400 --> 37:08.880]  Bird, take me with you.
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.680]  Let me get out of here.
[37:10.680 --> 37:12.420]  Take me with you!
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.780]  How long have we been doing this?
[37:15.560 --> 37:15.980]  Seven
[37:16.720 --> 37:17.140]  years.
[37:18.260 --> 37:20.580]  It's been seven years since we started this quest.
[37:30.440 --> 37:32.200]  Okay. I never got to do mount training
[37:32.200 --> 37:34.460]  in the army, but I took a lot of pictures of other people doing it.
[37:34.540 --> 37:36.300]  It seemed cool. That's cool. Did it look like this?
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.220]  It did it. There was no
[37:38.220 --> 37:38.740]  circles.
[37:40.320 --> 37:40.940]  I'm out.
[37:42.100 --> 37:43.900]  Yeah. Yeah. Not realistic.
[37:43.940 --> 37:45.700]  There was no diamonds, I remember.
[37:45.700 --> 37:47.640]  What are we doing?
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.440]  Diamonds are forever. Okay.
[37:51.100 --> 37:51.720]  Got it!
[37:51.940 --> 37:53.680]  Nailed it! Go, soldier!
[37:54.680 --> 37:55.720]  I think we gotta face
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.680]  west? Go, soldier. Go, soldier.
[37:57.860 --> 37:59.580]  Go. Where's the fucking west?
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Where's west? Where are they hiding west?
[38:02.380 --> 38:03.720]  What are you talking about? That's right there.
[38:03.840 --> 38:05.260]  That's west. Yeah, it's blue.
[38:05.560 --> 38:07.880]  I just don't understand
[38:07.880 --> 38:09.780]  that blue is there, and then
[38:09.780 --> 38:11.100]  you go to it. I...
[38:11.600 --> 38:13.720]  He wants to face west. You're not playing this.
[38:14.600 --> 38:15.540]  I mean...
[38:15.540 --> 38:17.140]  You're not experiencing this.
[38:17.280 --> 38:19.540]  I am experiencing this. I mean, you're not really
[38:19.540 --> 38:21.140]  playing it either. You're not on the same level.
[38:22.440 --> 38:23.280]  That's true.
[38:24.240 --> 38:25.880]  Not by any fault of your own.
[38:26.440 --> 38:26.740]  No.
[38:29.980 --> 38:31.540]  Ho, ho, ho.
[38:33.180 --> 38:33.680]  AHHHHHH!
[38:34.260 --> 38:35.560]  I don't give a fuck.
[38:35.720 --> 38:37.420]  I agree, though.
[38:37.500 --> 38:39.660]  I do think that once you're done with
[38:39.660 --> 38:41.120]  mount training, you have to
[38:41.120 --> 38:42.380]  a-pan-pa-pan snail mount.
[38:43.140 --> 38:43.620]  Yeah.
[38:44.580 --> 38:48.400]  Okay, switch back to alpha.
[38:48.600 --> 38:51.020]  No problem.
[38:53.600 --> 38:54.980]  Yep, they sure are.
[38:56.520 --> 38:57.000]  Finally.
[38:59.500 --> 39:01.080]  I hope you're taking notes as secretary.
[39:01.240 --> 39:02.920]  Really? The difference is two feet?
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.160]  We can't just throw
[39:05.160 --> 39:06.580]  our grenade from... Okay.
[39:06.720 --> 39:09.200]  If we ever want to do one of those Twitch streams
[39:09.200 --> 39:10.080]  where we
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.940]  allow our audience to
[39:12.940 --> 39:15.740]  torture us for some reason for long periods of time
[39:15.740 --> 39:16.960]  and then we get money or something.
[39:17.280 --> 39:18.760]  No, don't put that out there!
[39:18.940 --> 39:20.720]  Just saying. Full playthrough.
[39:21.740 --> 39:22.260]  No!
[39:22.820 --> 39:25.140]  Oh, God. I'm sick that day.
[39:28.640 --> 39:29.840]  Oh, shut up!
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.460]  What a rookie mistake by me.
[39:34.460 --> 39:34.940]  You fool.
[39:37.180 --> 39:38.580]  I'll decide what's best for my
[39:38.580 --> 39:39.480]  team, soldier.
[39:40.120 --> 39:41.840]  Do you think they want you to run behind that car?
[39:42.960 --> 39:43.360]  Definitely.
[39:44.120 --> 39:46.100]  Wait until they tell you.
[39:48.540 --> 39:48.860]  No!
[39:53.970 --> 39:54.370]  Go!
[39:54.650 --> 39:56.410]  I like when you tell them to go and then it's
[39:57.350 --> 39:58.570]  sort of a... Oh, my God.
[40:01.210 --> 40:02.250]  There you go. Finally!
[40:03.010 --> 40:05.430]  I didn't do anything different.
[40:05.430 --> 40:07.130]  The exact same buttons.
[40:08.170 --> 40:08.990]  I'm deleting
[40:08.990 --> 40:11.130]  old emails while watching this.
[40:13.850 --> 40:15.390]  It's about as entertaining, yeah.
[40:16.030 --> 40:17.710]  And I just found one from 2016
[40:17.710 --> 40:19.550]  that says, don't miss out on tickets to
[40:19.550 --> 40:21.390]  Lazer Team. Oh, hell yeah.
[40:21.770 --> 40:22.950]  Did you miss out?
[40:23.190 --> 40:24.250]  I think I did.
[40:24.730 --> 40:26.790]  I haven't accessed this email in a long time.
[40:27.990 --> 40:29.470]  It was left unread.
[40:31.210 --> 40:32.010]  Oh, it was.
[40:32.010 --> 40:32.830]  Kill him.
[40:33.170 --> 40:35.570]  Oh, we got him real good.
[40:35.630 --> 40:36.890]  You're gone, buddy.
[40:37.090 --> 40:38.670]  And that's the end of them all.
[40:39.990 --> 40:40.670]  B.
[40:41.810 --> 40:42.630]  Yup. Y.
[40:43.230 --> 40:43.930]  Sure is.
[40:44.870 --> 40:46.190]  Stop shooting.
[40:47.650 --> 40:48.930]  They've surrendered.
[40:49.710 --> 40:50.970]  Jesus Christ.
[40:51.270 --> 40:53.050]  Papan, Papan, Snail 9.
[40:53.710 --> 40:56.090]  This fucking Alpha team is psychos.
[40:56.790 --> 40:57.570]  Papan, Papan,
[40:57.610 --> 40:58.690]  Papan, Papan.
[40:58.690 --> 41:00.250]  These guys are Seal Team sick.
[41:02.790 --> 41:04.370]  I just made that up on the spot.
[41:05.010 --> 41:05.530]  I liked it.
[41:05.750 --> 41:07.990]  That's a code to unlock another Punisher trailer.
[41:10.170 --> 41:11.930]  At least we got the Punisher trailer, right?
[41:12.330 --> 41:14.890]  Yeah. That's the best part
[41:14.890 --> 41:15.470]  of this game.
[41:15.830 --> 41:17.250]  We're only like 45 minutes.
[41:18.050 --> 41:20.110]  This has felt like the longest gameplay of all time.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.520]  I just think we know it's not over.
[41:25.540 --> 41:27.060]  How is this not the end?
[41:27.060 --> 41:29.640]  I just think we need to do a little bit more research
[41:29.640 --> 41:31.160]  before we play games from now on.
[41:31.280 --> 41:31.940]  That's all I'm saying.
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.720]  Just watch a YouTube video.
[41:39.540 --> 41:40.060]  Who, me?
[41:40.640 --> 41:41.500]  Yeah, you alright?
[41:42.220 --> 41:42.780]  Yeah, man.
[41:53.100 --> 41:54.880]  I liked earlier when I asked Gavin
[41:54.880 --> 41:55.980]  if he liked this game.
[41:56.320 --> 41:57.600]  What kind of question is that?
[41:57.960 --> 41:59.680]  I think I understand what he meant.
[42:01.100 --> 42:02.560]  I just asked him how he was.
[42:02.660 --> 42:04.000]  I didn't ask him about any of this.
[42:07.480 --> 42:09.060]  Let me end this.
[42:11.760 --> 42:14.580]  Hey, if you like this...
[42:15.100 --> 42:16.380]  What's wrong with you?
[42:16.620 --> 42:19.200]  A million people bought this game
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.220]  and suffered through this.
[42:21.960 --> 42:23.060]  Did it say how many people
[42:23.060 --> 42:24.620]  asked for refunds?
[42:24.620 --> 42:24.960]  It did.
[42:31.980 --> 42:38.400]  I mean, this has to be the end of this.
[42:38.680 --> 42:41.000]  You keep saying that and I don't...
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.040]  Oh no!
[42:42.980 --> 42:44.220]  They're breaking our box!
[42:44.920 --> 42:45.800]  Oh shit!
[42:47.600 --> 42:48.900]  They're chunking it!
[42:48.900 --> 42:49.400]  Oh!
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.240]  There's gonna be a little Peter Molyneux
[42:53.240 --> 42:53.680]  in this thing.
[42:54.740 --> 42:56.420]  You're gonna die in this pictorial.
[42:57.460 --> 42:58.680]  No, no, we're going to cover.
[43:02.650 --> 43:04.870]  No! Why does all the cover
[43:04.870 --> 43:05.570]  break?
[43:06.350 --> 43:07.770]  You guys are gonna have to...
[43:07.770 --> 43:09.910]  You'll be safe behind the couch.
[43:10.250 --> 43:12.750]  Yeah, the couch is gonna hold strong.
[43:13.470 --> 43:14.110]  Couch potatoes.
[43:16.730 --> 43:18.590]  Oh no, not the couch now!
[43:18.590 --> 43:19.830]  Oh no.
[43:22.390 --> 43:23.870]  I mean, he's not shooting right now.
[43:24.770 --> 43:26.350]  Blow him away, bro.
[43:27.290 --> 43:28.850]  He's walking slowly away.
[43:31.290 --> 43:31.890]  Oh!
[43:34.890 --> 43:36.710]  The final course!
[43:37.150 --> 43:37.930]  Is that what he said?
[43:38.450 --> 43:40.330]  Yes. I think you ran past him.
[43:43.070 --> 43:44.170]  We better not.
[43:45.070 --> 43:45.310]  Go.
[43:45.310 --> 43:46.330]  It's not green.
[43:47.770 --> 43:48.290]  Shit!
[43:49.990 --> 43:51.290]  I mean, like, I don't get
[43:51.290 --> 43:53.370]  what you don't get about some of
[43:53.370 --> 43:55.190]  these indicators. They're different
[43:55.190 --> 43:57.470]  colors and they only
[43:57.470 --> 43:59.310]  show up...
[44:00.230 --> 44:01.310]  You're saying next time
[44:01.310 --> 44:02.970]  I'm never gonna see this game again.
[44:03.110 --> 44:04.950]  I'm never gonna see this game again.
[44:05.030 --> 44:07.410]  When the audience makes us do a full playthrough on Twitch
[44:07.410 --> 44:07.730]  we will.
[44:09.590 --> 44:11.470]  We is a loose term in that
[44:11.470 --> 44:12.050]  situation.
[44:12.050 --> 44:14.050]  Are we on lesson five?
[44:14.670 --> 44:16.150]  This is it. This is the
[44:16.150 --> 44:18.030]  final one. It's the five
[44:18.030 --> 44:20.010]  part series. He said.
[44:20.390 --> 44:20.630]  Oh.
[44:22.570 --> 44:24.130]  We got a distress
[44:24.130 --> 44:25.570]  call. It was us.
[44:29.370 --> 44:30.050]  Okay.
[44:32.590 --> 44:33.950]  Save them.
[44:35.450 --> 44:35.770]  Yeah.
[44:36.310 --> 44:37.930]  Let's go. Let's do it.
[44:46.500 --> 44:47.180]  What's
[44:47.180 --> 44:47.940]  the white button?
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.160]  That was opposite the black button. The opposite of the black button.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.700]  Yeah. It's on the other side of the controller.
[45:03.340 --> 45:04.180]  That's the blue one.
[45:04.620 --> 45:05.020]  Yeah.
[45:07.400 --> 45:08.120]  There it is.
[45:11.140 --> 45:11.540]  What?
[45:11.800 --> 45:13.900]  At least the voice acting's good.
[45:16.940 --> 45:17.840]  Where's the little bird?
[45:18.960 --> 45:19.180]  Oh!
[45:21.980 --> 45:23.660]  I think it's on the other side of that tree
[45:23.660 --> 45:24.620]  you keep spinning away from.
[45:26.520 --> 45:27.240]  There you go.
[45:29.220 --> 45:30.640]  I mean it's blue.
[45:31.780 --> 45:33.100]  It shows you where it is.
[45:33.860 --> 45:35.460]  The thing pops up in the top right
[45:35.460 --> 45:36.640]  when you roll over it.
[45:36.800 --> 45:38.620]  I don't know.
[45:39.400 --> 45:39.680]  There it is.
[45:41.600 --> 45:41.720]  Oh.
[45:44.900 --> 45:46.680]  You managed to avoid that thing.
[45:52.260 --> 45:53.000]  Sort of an
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.920]  if I can't see it, it can't see me
[45:54.920 --> 45:55.700]  kind of situation.
[45:58.260 --> 45:58.700]  Okay.
[46:02.810 --> 46:04.150]  Okay, we got some symbols.
[46:07.710 --> 46:08.750]  As soon as
[46:08.750 --> 46:10.310]  it started, I knew I fucking hate it.
[46:10.870 --> 46:12.150]  As soon as it started.
[46:12.950 --> 46:14.230]  This is so calm
[46:14.230 --> 46:16.630]  and fucking squad
[46:16.630 --> 46:17.290]  based.
[46:17.850 --> 46:19.390]  I hate it.
[46:19.930 --> 46:22.250]  It's not even a video game. It's like reading a book.
[46:22.250 --> 46:23.250]  Shit sucks.
[46:25.130 --> 46:25.750]  You like reading?
[46:26.550 --> 46:27.490]  Fuck no.
[46:30.270 --> 46:31.150]  Glart.
[46:31.510 --> 46:33.050]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[46:34.210 --> 46:35.090]  Alright.
[46:35.970 --> 46:38.090]  Down to 48 unreads.
[46:40.290 --> 46:41.170]  Lorg.
[46:45.250 --> 46:46.130]  Trag.
[46:50.210 --> 46:51.570]  Oh my god.
[46:51.810 --> 46:52.530]  Oh my god.
[46:52.530 --> 46:53.910]  I gotta go meet Jack Petillo.
[46:56.330 --> 46:56.550]  When?
[46:57.010 --> 46:58.350]  No you don't, he's coming to your house.
[46:58.370 --> 46:59.210]  Does he owe you something?
[47:01.170 --> 47:03.530]  No, I'm helping him do a thing at the studio.
[47:03.790 --> 47:04.490]  Oh, that's nice of you.
[47:05.050 --> 47:05.950]  Oh, that's very nice.
[47:07.790 --> 47:09.250]  Isn't the studio your house?
[47:09.910 --> 47:10.130]  No.
[47:10.770 --> 47:12.790]  Is this your way of saying you're
[47:12.790 --> 47:14.490]  sticking out the rest of the video?
[47:14.730 --> 47:15.610]  We appreciate it.
[47:16.330 --> 47:18.550]  Yeah, I mean, you did say you didn't have to leave
[47:18.550 --> 47:20.590]  until 24 more minutes or whatever.
[47:20.810 --> 47:21.710]  Do you have Discord on your phone?
[47:22.170 --> 47:23.730]  Be there at 24 minutes.
[47:24.590 --> 47:26.710]  Oh, you know, you have Discord on your phone though, right?
[47:26.850 --> 47:28.550]  Well, you know, if the
[47:28.550 --> 47:30.650]  pan pan snail pan
[47:30.650 --> 47:32.870]  worked, we wouldn't be
[47:32.870 --> 47:34.430]  doing this right now, so I feel like
[47:34.430 --> 47:35.450]  this is your fault.
[47:35.970 --> 47:38.490]  Gavin, Andrew's about to get fucking blown away.
[47:38.490 --> 47:39.930]  You just got full spectrum murder.
[47:39.930 --> 47:40.990]  Gavin can just go mobile.
[47:41.430 --> 47:42.190]  Yeah, you just lost.
[47:42.390 --> 47:43.390]  No. No.
[47:44.250 --> 47:44.690]  No!
[47:46.010 --> 47:46.330]  No!
[47:50.030 --> 47:51.790]  I mean, he didn't do
[47:51.790 --> 47:52.310]  anything.
[47:53.090 --> 47:55.750]  He didn't do anything that was asked of him
[47:55.750 --> 47:57.750]  and just ran out into the street.
[47:57.990 --> 48:00.010]  What did he expect was going to happen?
[48:00.030 --> 48:01.990]  Why are you never paying attention, soldier?
[48:02.130 --> 48:03.830]  He said, go behind this thing,
[48:03.950 --> 48:05.170]  call in and give me a report.
[48:05.510 --> 48:07.430]  So you ran somewhere,
[48:07.430 --> 48:09.330]  you didn't hit the button,
[48:09.670 --> 48:11.190]  and then you ran out into the street
[48:11.190 --> 48:12.810]  where the guys with guns are.
[48:13.290 --> 48:14.490]  You're killing us!
[48:14.510 --> 48:17.430]  In a previous company, we'd have called that a
[48:17.430 --> 48:19.090]  let's fail. We don't have access to that.
[48:19.130 --> 48:20.670]  Is this a regulation fail?
[48:20.870 --> 48:23.250]  It is a regulation fail, 100%.
[48:24.330 --> 48:25.630]  Oh my god.
[48:26.850 --> 48:27.530]  This is gonna
[48:27.530 --> 48:28.250]  need a part two.
[48:32.690 --> 48:35.250]  I like the one cheat code which is almost
[48:35.250 --> 48:36.910]  your name doesn't work.
[48:40.130 --> 48:43.290]  Okay, well I'm gonna get to see the helicopter
[48:43.290 --> 48:45.360]  this time at least. We'll see about that.
[48:51.510 --> 48:53.170]  This is insane.
[48:53.570 --> 48:55.310]  There it is, there it is. This is awful.
[48:56.790 --> 48:59.430]  I feel like we could've cut when he was freaking out.
[49:01.770 --> 49:03.030]  Yeah, well we didn't.
[49:03.030 --> 49:05.050]  When he dies again here...
[49:05.050 --> 49:07.330]  That's the whole reason I said it was to give us the out.
[49:07.930 --> 49:08.870]  That was a good out.
[49:08.930 --> 49:10.090]  Let's take the out.
[49:10.570 --> 49:12.270]  No, we've gone too far.
[49:12.390 --> 49:13.370]  But I gotta go!
[49:14.530 --> 49:15.810]  You better go then.
[49:15.830 --> 49:17.090]  My problem is everything.
[49:18.090 --> 49:20.070]  You can cut your audio,
[49:20.650 --> 49:22.690]  and I'll just use Craig for whenever you pop back in.
[49:22.990 --> 49:25.250]  Hey Gav, it's no big deal if you need to leave
[49:25.250 --> 49:26.570]  to go do your thing with Jack.
[49:26.690 --> 49:29.050]  Now as soon as Gav leaves, let's start talking about
[49:29.050 --> 49:30.350]  divvying up his 20%.
[49:30.350 --> 49:31.710]  Yeah, I mean, we haven't...
[49:31.710 --> 49:33.590]  I technically haven't sent it to the lawyer,
[49:33.750 --> 49:35.330]  so we can just kind of figure it out.
[49:36.290 --> 49:38.530]  I feel like he's giving a real...
[49:38.530 --> 49:40.930]  He's giving a real 18% effort,
[49:41.090 --> 49:41.650]  so I'm thinking...
[49:41.650 --> 49:44.110]  Yeah, I mean, as the president, I'm okay with this.
[49:44.650 --> 49:45.410]  Write that down, Andrew.
[49:50.990 --> 49:51.870]  Okay, bye Gavin.
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.220]  Four years of this shit.
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.180]  Okay.
[50:08.240 --> 50:09.300]  Move towards the objective,
[50:09.540 --> 50:10.300]  keep a low profile.
[50:10.460 --> 50:13.820]  So much funny shit happened in this video, nobody's ever gonna see.
[50:14.000 --> 50:14.480]  That's so sad.
[50:16.740 --> 50:17.540]  God damn.
[50:18.680 --> 50:19.520]  Did you blow it again?
[50:20.140 --> 50:21.100]  No, no, no.
[50:21.520 --> 50:23.540]  This is where the guy says,
[50:23.660 --> 50:25.060]  okay, now get behind cover,
[50:25.180 --> 50:27.320]  and then call me to give me a sitrep.
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.460]  And then Andrew didn't do that last time,
[50:29.480 --> 50:31.740]  so he's gonna do it this time. He's gonna find the white button,
[50:31.820 --> 50:32.680]  and he's gonna fucking nail it.
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.240]  Okay.
[50:36.880 --> 50:37.720]  Okay, I got it.
[50:37.740 --> 50:39.240]  I'm gonna go stand in that circle,
[50:39.460 --> 50:40.500]  and I'm gonna hit the white button.
[50:40.820 --> 50:44.220]  If it helps, I really needed to leave about a half an hour ago.
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.040]  I'm just fucking...
[50:49.040 --> 50:52.320]  Every minute I'm here in this video
[50:52.320 --> 50:53.860]  is affecting me negatively
[50:53.860 --> 50:55.180]  in my personal life right now.
[50:56.380 --> 50:56.740]  Same.
[50:59.060 --> 51:00.560]  I'm right there with you, Gav.
[51:02.300 --> 51:03.380]  I'm reporting in.
[51:03.620 --> 51:06.320]  I just looked at the clock and realized how bad I fucked up.
[51:06.480 --> 51:06.840]  Okay.
[51:09.700 --> 51:11.120]  Am I good to go?
[51:12.360 --> 51:12.900]  Yeah, man.
[51:13.040 --> 51:14.460]  I hit the white button.
[51:16.280 --> 51:17.500]  Guys, look at the white button.
[51:17.720 --> 51:19.340]  Game boy.
[51:20.280 --> 51:21.200]  Where's your second screen?
[51:22.380 --> 51:23.480]  I know what they want from me.
[51:24.180 --> 51:25.460]  Okay, we're gonna move up on the edge.
[51:25.740 --> 51:26.220]  We're gonna peek.
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.060]  I'm not peeking.
[51:32.060 --> 51:33.240]  Why can't I peek?
[51:37.200 --> 51:39.980]  Why is that still there?
[51:42.200 --> 51:43.500]  Fall back, soldiers!
[51:44.860 --> 51:46.220]  Okay, let's go back into this.
[51:47.360 --> 51:48.580]  Uh, maybe you wanna go around that.
[51:48.640 --> 51:49.420]  Do we gotta bring Bravo?
[51:50.460 --> 51:52.440]  Oh, maybe you're advancing these guys now.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.120]  God, I feel like he gave so many instructions.
[51:59.800 --> 52:01.600]  Let's get everybody in the little circle.
[52:03.420 --> 52:04.640]  Your attention, Bravo.
[52:09.180 --> 52:09.980]  Jesus Christ.
[52:11.980 --> 52:14.220]  We're not gonna take your percent. You can go.
[52:14.820 --> 52:15.560]  Yeah, you're alright.
[52:16.000 --> 52:16.200]  Oh!
[52:17.900 --> 52:18.820]  Oh my god.
[52:19.540 --> 52:20.240]  That was it!
[52:22.300 --> 52:24.300]  Come back for part two!
[52:24.860 --> 52:25.740]  There's no part two.
[52:26.120 --> 52:27.180]  Funny would it be if that was the end of the training.
[52:27.180 --> 52:29.320]  Well, now we have to try a pan-pa-pan-pa-tan.
[52:29.660 --> 52:31.620]  Well, he's not done with this. He's still in the training.
[52:31.700 --> 52:32.320]  He's still in the mouth.
[52:34.360 --> 52:35.320]  He's still in the mouth.
[52:38.660 --> 52:39.000]  No?
[52:39.480 --> 52:40.100]  See that big red dot?
[52:40.100 --> 52:43.120]  You need to go to the corner and look around and see where these guys are.
[52:43.460 --> 52:44.400]  Yeah, there you go.
[52:47.900 --> 52:49.340]  There you go.
[52:51.580 --> 52:53.420]  Why did that look like the end and then it wasn't?
[52:55.020 --> 53:01.020]  Oh, do you think that you could die and reload to that spot?
[53:02.420 --> 53:03.480]  Should we just kill him?
[53:04.760 --> 53:08.160]  No, you probably have to suppress fire, run the other team up to the closer building.
[53:08.860 --> 53:09.720]  Oh, he's dead.
[53:10.880 --> 53:11.320]  Insane.
[53:11.780 --> 53:13.280]  Run up to that building. There you go.
[53:13.800 --> 53:15.040]  You don't know what you're on about, Eric.
[53:16.660 --> 53:19.740]  That's fucking outrageous that it just let you do that.
[53:20.060 --> 53:23.260]  Everything was about tactically moving up and it was that.
[53:23.300 --> 53:27.120]  That was be as far as you can and just start pulling the trigger.
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.860]  That is fucking crazy.
[53:28.860 --> 53:31.320]  Fire full auto from 200 feet away.
[53:32.940 --> 53:35.500]  Four to one, you like those odds a little bit more.
[53:36.680 --> 53:37.700]  Right? Maybe?
[53:39.840 --> 53:40.980]  Oh shit, dude.
[53:41.700 --> 53:43.240]  I guess do it again.
[53:44.200 --> 53:55.040]  Okay, let's move them now.
[53:55.180 --> 53:56.280]  Oh, I'm getting the hang of this.
[53:59.120 --> 54:00.500]  You could flank him.
[54:01.260 --> 54:02.200]  That's what I'm doing.
[54:02.200 --> 54:03.400]  I'm pincering him.
[54:06.360 --> 54:07.920]  Let's move them over here.
[54:08.660 --> 54:09.800]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[54:10.780 --> 54:12.540]  Oh, this flank is going to be so good.
[54:12.620 --> 54:14.020]  That's thinking on the spectrum.
[54:14.880 --> 54:16.320]  Mm-hmm, the full spectrum.
[54:20.820 --> 54:22.360]  Can you get up closer?
[54:23.700 --> 54:24.820]  Oh, there you go.
[54:29.690 --> 54:31.450]  Oh, they're about to get fucked up.
[54:31.510 --> 54:32.630]  Fucking dead.
[54:33.450 --> 54:35.030]  Dude, just grenade launch that dude.
[54:35.290 --> 54:35.570]  There you go.
[54:37.130 --> 54:37.930]  Oh God.
[54:39.750 --> 54:40.530]  Done. Wow.
[54:40.970 --> 54:41.830]  Dead as dicks.
[54:43.270 --> 54:44.930]  Gavin, you're still here? Why don't you leave?
[54:46.670 --> 54:47.750]  I want my 20%.
[54:48.950 --> 54:50.950]  We're not going to take your 20%.
[54:51.890 --> 54:53.470]  Yeah, we were going to take maybe two.
[54:53.670 --> 54:54.930]  Oh, I'm almost there. I'm almost there.
[54:55.650 --> 54:57.870]  I almost did it. Guys, I almost did it.
[54:58.510 --> 54:59.490]  We're almost there.
[55:00.330 --> 55:01.150]  Oh, he's dead.
[55:01.150 --> 55:02.370]  What happened to you?
[55:03.290 --> 55:04.830]  Someone brought live rounds.
[55:07.430 --> 55:08.410]  Hit the white button.
[55:11.290 --> 55:11.890]  No!
[55:13.990 --> 55:14.590]  No!
[55:15.810 --> 55:16.110]  No!
[55:20.370 --> 55:23.750]  That is like the worst thing he could have said.
[55:23.850 --> 55:26.670]  That is the worst thing he could have said.
[55:26.730 --> 55:28.690]  That is the worst thing he could have said.
[55:28.910 --> 55:31.030]  That is the worst thing he could have said.
[55:31.030 --> 55:32.730]  That's so crazy.
[55:32.890 --> 55:33.890]  This was great.
[55:34.990 --> 55:37.250]  E3 2004, love it.
[55:37.630 --> 55:41.050]  If we leave now, you have to do that whole level 5 again.
[55:41.310 --> 55:42.830]  Oh, Geoff.
[55:43.350 --> 55:43.590]  I'm just saying.
[55:45.990 --> 55:46.550]  Geoff!
[55:47.310 --> 55:48.370]  I'm just saying.
[55:48.550 --> 55:50.670]  No, not more of this.
[55:51.490 --> 55:52.830]  Leave now, let's go.
[55:53.190 --> 55:54.710]  Listen, I'm in deep shit.
[55:54.910 --> 55:56.010]  I need to leave.
[55:56.010 --> 55:56.350]  Dude.
[55:58.410 --> 56:00.610]  I got more important people to disappoint than Jack.
[56:00.790 --> 56:01.830]  No offense to him.
[56:05.950 --> 56:07.570]  Wait, this guy is going to die?
[56:08.470 --> 56:09.790]  Well, we can't let him die.
[56:12.370 --> 56:13.730]  Oh, how do I aid him?
[56:14.110 --> 56:15.370]  Why are we still playing this?
[56:15.550 --> 56:17.330]  I thought we just went, that's good enough.
[56:17.350 --> 56:18.850]  This guy is going to die.
[56:19.310 --> 56:19.730]  Good!
[56:20.230 --> 56:23.390]  That guy is me.
[56:23.390 --> 56:24.930]  Let me go.
[56:25.210 --> 56:27.030]  No, he bleeds red, white, and blue.
[56:27.190 --> 56:28.130]  He's American.
[56:28.870 --> 56:30.550]  Take care of our own.
[56:31.250 --> 56:32.170]  And Gavin.
[56:33.950 --> 56:36.830]  Hey, my flag is red, white, and blue.
[56:37.230 --> 56:37.610]  That's true.
[56:38.370 --> 56:42.030]  I thought it was white and red.
[56:42.570 --> 56:43.310]  By the way, Eric.
[56:43.770 --> 56:48.650]  You need to start acting a little more presidential in times like this.
[56:49.090 --> 56:50.830]  I feel like I'm being very presidential.
[56:50.830 --> 56:53.590]  I'm going to veto the fuck out of this game.
[56:56.670 --> 57:00.250]  When this game crosses my desk.
[57:01.350 --> 57:03.070]  Veto stamp in the trash.
[57:05.810 --> 57:06.970]  Alright, I'm leaving.
[57:07.290 --> 57:08.090]  Bye, Gavin.
[57:11.250 --> 57:13.750]  I think we could have ended the video twice already.
[57:14.330 --> 57:14.870]  Yeah, absolutely.
[57:15.270 --> 57:16.010]  Here we are.
[57:18.950 --> 57:20.550]  I'm still doing this.
[57:21.490 --> 57:22.330]  Here we are.
[57:22.470 --> 57:24.010]  Should we bump him down to 15%?
[57:24.090 --> 57:26.270]  Yeah, just a little bit more.
[57:26.430 --> 57:27.310]  I'm making him my call.
[57:27.710 --> 57:28.770]  Could we do 16%?
[57:28.850 --> 57:29.810]  We each get one more percent.
[57:30.090 --> 57:30.450]  Yes!
[57:31.470 --> 57:32.870]  Look at what he missed.
[57:34.990 --> 57:36.390]  Do you think he...
[57:36.790 --> 57:38.890]  Yeah, his thing is still on.
[57:39.010 --> 57:40.330]  Is it over?
[57:40.750 --> 57:41.390]  That's not a half.
[57:42.550 --> 57:44.230]  He's going to be like, I didn't leave!
[57:46.670 --> 57:47.190]  See?
[58:00.070 --> 58:03.850]  This is the funniest video we've ever done.
[58:04.190 --> 58:06.370]  And no one's ever going to see it.
[58:06.750 --> 58:07.450]  What are you talking about?
[58:07.790 --> 58:08.870]  No one's going to know.
[58:09.350 --> 58:11.090]  They're never going to see the funny parts.
[58:11.090 --> 58:12.870]  They're going to watch the beginning and then leave.
[58:13.330 --> 58:14.130]  Oh man.
[58:14.910 --> 58:16.470]  Kill him. Kill him!
[58:17.250 --> 58:20.270]  Suppress fire here and then just switch over to your other team and flank him.
[58:20.690 --> 58:22.150]  I gotta send you guys...
[58:22.150 --> 58:23.210]  Fuck, Gavin's going to miss this.
[58:23.310 --> 58:25.230]  I gotta send you guys a photo right now.
[58:25.750 --> 58:27.250]  My dog is at doggy daycare.
[58:28.670 --> 58:29.470]  Oh no.
[58:29.710 --> 58:32.370]  They send updates throughout the day of him playing and stuff.
[58:32.530 --> 58:32.950]  Oh, okay.
[58:34.950 --> 58:36.230]  Emily just sent this to me.
[58:36.710 --> 58:39.850]  This picture, the dog looks like Predator.
[58:39.850 --> 58:41.150]  I swear to God.
[58:41.210 --> 58:42.830]  You've never seen anything like this in your life.
[58:43.810 --> 58:45.210]  Oh wow, cool!
[58:45.350 --> 58:46.850]  He does look like Predator.
[58:48.530 --> 58:50.750]  His floppy cheeks are up in the air.
[58:50.930 --> 58:52.950]  And he's just like all mouth and teeth.
[58:53.130 --> 58:53.530]  That's crazy.
[58:55.030 --> 58:55.730]  That's awesome.
[58:59.380 --> 59:00.180]  Oh no!
[59:00.400 --> 59:01.740]  Well, I mean, what were you thinking?
[59:02.680 --> 59:03.080]  Good.
[59:03.740 --> 59:05.000]  Honestly, good.
[59:05.840 --> 59:08.940]  Oh, let's see where it kicks you back to.
[59:09.100 --> 59:09.900]  No, we hit a save.
[59:09.900 --> 59:10.460]  We hit a save.
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.960]  The whole game has been moving to cover from an area.
[59:16.420 --> 59:18.540]  So you ran into the middle of the street.
[59:18.960 --> 59:19.260]  Again.
[59:19.600 --> 59:21.820]  I just want it to be over, Eric.
[59:21.960 --> 59:22.980]  So do we, man.
[59:23.420 --> 59:24.640]  You're making it take longer.
[59:25.360 --> 59:25.760]  You are.
[59:26.640 --> 59:27.940]  Now switch to Bravo.
[59:28.240 --> 59:30.460]  While this is happening.
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.200]  Everything can work in tandem.
[59:34.240 --> 59:36.020]  It's a real time strategy game.
[59:36.160 --> 59:37.460]  You can work in real time.
[59:39.360 --> 59:40.360]  Yeah, this is good.
[59:42.040 --> 59:43.300]  Nick has doubts.
[59:43.860 --> 59:44.520]  Can he?
[59:45.380 --> 59:46.360]  Point blank shooting.
[59:47.080 --> 59:47.520]  Wow.
[59:49.760 --> 59:51.380]  Okay, so now let's move them here.
[59:51.540 --> 59:53.060]  Yeah, and then you switch over to the other team.
[59:53.140 --> 59:54.300]  You move them up also.
[59:54.580 --> 59:56.140]  Again, this is like...
[59:56.140 --> 59:58.400]  This is the worst style of video game.
[59:58.800 --> 59:59.760]  I hate...
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.760]  I hate this kind of video game.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.780]  It sucks.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.020]  It's not fun, and it sucks.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.740]  And you have to do everything all at once.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.880]  And you don't get to play anything.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.240]  Oh.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.900]  What happened?
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.180]  You lost again.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.320]  Who killed me?
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.740]  Another team.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.500]  I think the enemy.
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.620]  Yeah, but where?
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.680]  I was in cover.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.700]  Maybe you were moving too much in tandem.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.460]  That's...
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.520]  I didn't mean to go that far.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.580]  That was an accident.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.160]  Somebody came out.
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.480]  She tried to do it on purpose.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.380]  Get back into cover.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.940]  We're going this way because that's where we died from.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.140]  I think there's somebody in here that got me.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:53.760]  Yeah.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:55.980]  Good catch.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:56.700]  Got him.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.120]  Got him.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.720]  Got that motherfucker.
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.200]  Now I'll sneak around this.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:03.980]  I like it.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.880]  You're killing it.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.600]  Is there any more back there?
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.340]  No, we're clear.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.800]  Only just needs Alpha.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.220]  I only need Alpha, man.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.140]  Andrew, you are 100%
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.780]  fully on the spectrum right now.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.100]  Yeah, you're full spectrum.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.920]  You're full spectrum gaming right now, dude.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.480]  You're an active gamer if I've ever seen one.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.980]  He's extremely active.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:27.940]  Uh-oh.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:35.880]  We got tank busters.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.080]  So you need to bring up another team
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.460]  that can use the tank buster.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.660]  Oh, cool.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.520]  Mortars?
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.580]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.020]  I mean, Helmo.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.700]  God, I hate this.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.700]  Why is it still going?
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.280]  Mission go.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.600]  Gavin was right.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.820]  I should've said that I was meeting Jack or something too.
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.540]  I should've lied.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.180]  I just remembered I'm supposed to meet Jack and Gavin.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:12.740]  Okay.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.540]  Back where I was.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.900]  Anybody else that wants to give up 2%
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.740]  feel free.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.880]  What I meant to say is I'm having a good time.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.680]  Oh, I'm not having a good time.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.580]  I'm just not going anywhere.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.280]  I'm miserable. I'm just not losing my 2%.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.560]  I'm having a bad time.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:31.760]  Okay.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:35.300]  Okay.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.740]  Press and hold.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.080]  Okay.
[01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:50.010]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:51.510]  Boom.
[01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:55.550]  Yep.
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:56.630]  Yeah, we saw that.
[01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.130]  Okay.
[01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.790]  Okay.
[01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.370]  Can we do it now?
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:06.950]  Just tell me how.
[01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.150]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.890]  Oh, my God. Shut.
[01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:14.950]  We're losing Nick here.
[01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.950]  Hey. No, it's okay. I'm alright.
[01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:19.450]  Yeah.
[01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.770]  Oh.
[01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:22.250]  Fuck you, tank.
[01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.690]  Just die.
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:25.830]  Hey.
[01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:28.010]  Wow.
[01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:33.530]  Okay, that has to...
[01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:34.270]  Okay, we did it.
[01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:36.410]  Hey, we can stop now.
[01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:38.050]  They're very dead.
[01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:41.310]  I kind of need to go that way.
[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:45.870]  Yeah, I don't care, though.
[01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.730]  I just want to...
[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:49.090]  I just...
[01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:49.990]  I just want to go.
[01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:51.650]  We're just going to go.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.500]  The we're just going to go
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.780]  is why we restart a bunch.
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:03:59.060]  Yeah.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.840]  You're right.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.760]  I'm not arguing. You're right.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.700]  It's factually correct.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.680]  Let's give the other teams some love.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.200]  They're just hanging out still.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.520]  Oh, there it is.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.120]  That's it.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:26.540]  That's it.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.240]  Yeah.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.000]  Oh, thank God.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.880]  I hope that guy doesn't shoot you.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.440]  Oh, the doctor.
[01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:53.090]  What's a casavac?
[01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:56.090]  It's a...
[01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.050]  I was asking Geoff, the guy who was in the military.
[01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:59.790]  A casavac?
[01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:02.370]  Bravo is all the way back.
[01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:03.850]  A casavac?
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.290]  You know, I've never heard that phrase before,
[01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.150]  but I assume he means casualty.
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:12.170]  Oh, like a casualty evacuation?
[01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.910]  Yeah.
[01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.870]  Go. Straight shot. Straight shot. All the way.
[01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:17.310]  Come on, Charlie!
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.610]  You think Bravo's in there or no?
[01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.470]  No. Almost.
[01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.930]  They're so close.
[01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.470]  Get everybody in the circle.
[01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.710]  Okay, this has to be it.
[01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:40.150]  Yeah!
[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:40.850]  Yes!
[01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:44.850]  No one will see this part,
[01:05:45.010 --> 01:05:45.750]  but we did it.
[01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:46.550]  Oh, thank God.
[01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.870]  I just want to play the game.
[01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.390]  That was the game. Game over.
[01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.570]  Wait, why isn't it ending?
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.310]  You just did it faster than everyone else.
[01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.610]  Why isn't it ending?
[01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.310]  What's the blue icon?
[01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:01.390]  There's still a blue...
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:02.990]  There you go.
[01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:05.470]  Move to the objective when you want to exit.
[01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:07.150]  Oh my God.
[01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.150]  Why did you say the course was over?
[01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:13.310]  There it is.
[01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.210]  Please land on it.
[01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:16.370]  Victory.
[01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:18.150]  Just head right to that objective.
[01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.670]  To victory!
[01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.510]  Yes!
[01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.110]  Oh my God.
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.010]  No one saw that we did this.
[01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:26.710]  Just like that.
[01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:30.690]  Oh, you gotta try. Snap Snail 5 or whatever.
[01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:31.090]  Okay.
[01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.830]  Barely an hour and five minutes into it.
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.790]  Our service members will be feeding.
[01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.130]  In the next moment, they will be holding
[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.510]  two warring tribes apart.
[01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.730]  Finally.
[01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:46.670]  I just want the moment where the campaign starts.
[01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.670]  I don't care about any of these other moments.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:56.520]  Cutscene.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:57.580]  No.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.500]  It's a puppy.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.180]  A dog.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.220]  And an umbrella.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.380]  Fallout.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.620]  Dogs didn't get blown up. War never changes.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.460]  Oh no.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.180]  Thank God war changed from this.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.440]  I love watching the Fallout TV show with somebody who doesn't know video games.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.280]  When that part came up in the show,
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.400]  I said it like three seconds ahead of time.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.560]  Emily thought I was a genius.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.180]  How the fuck did you know they were going to say that?
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.320]  Oh dude,
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.160]  Zekistan? You ever been?
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.520]  It's not safe to go to Zekistan.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.180]  I think that's where Gavin's meeting Jack.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.820]  Dude, Zekistan's not our...
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.680]  They're not friendly to us in Zekistan.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:38.800]  Damn.
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.480]  This is what I thought I would see
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.000]  three minutes into this video.
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.030]  I've got green smoke!
[01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.390]  Why are we...
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.260]  I was so excited that you finished it, and we're trapped.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.640]  Yeah, so was I.
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.660]  We're trapped.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.900]  Is this what it's like, Geoff?
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.500]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:10.840]  Did it freeze?
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.020]  Geoff? Andrew?
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:14.100]  Andrew?
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.540]  God, Andrew.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.280]  Geoff, just leave.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.880]  I'll kill you, Andrew. I will kill you.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.080]  Look at the bottom, the timer.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:22.940]  It froze.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.140]  Well, thank you guys so much
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.620]  for watching. We appreciate you guys...
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:28.920]  Anyone?
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.720]  Okay, you're there, you're there.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.160]  Any Spectrum Warriors out there?
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.220]  Any active gamers?
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:36.720]  Hello?
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.720]  Yeah, can you hear us?
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.240]  That's fine, I didn't need them anyway.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.320]  What? We can hear you!
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.880]  I'm back on board.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.260]  See that goose?
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:47.580]  It's spitting blood.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.000]  Hell yeah.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.060]  Aim into that, hey.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.600]  Aim into that, brother.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.620]  Oh, you can hear me?
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.860]  We're back!
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.260]  We didn't lose anything!
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.160]  Yes!
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.140]  Andrew, can you hear us?
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.440]  This is not a bit.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.340]  No, you were gone for a full minute.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.700]  I'm assuming this is a bit.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.440]  No, it froze and you were completely gone.
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.120]  We thought we lost everything.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.560]  We thought we lost everything.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.620]  This isn't a bit, we just need to end this.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.480]  As much as I'd like to learn more about Iron Man Mendes.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.760]  Yeah, it's in the video.
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:27.160]  Oh, I think he's still in the past.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.320]  Oh. Do we have to get through the cutscene to end it?
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.060]  Oh God, please, no.
[01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:39.550]  That's beautiful.
[01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:41.050]  No, it's not.
[01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:44.510]  Shut up, rabbit, you stupid bitch.
[01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:46.570]  I don't know what's going on anymore.
[01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.990]  I feel like I've lost my mind.
[01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:50.370]  So you can't hear us at all, Andrew?
[01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:51.170]  I don't know if you can hear me.
[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:53.210]  Oh, this is terrible.
[01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:54.950]  This is awful.
[01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:56.270]  I don't know.
[01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:04.330]  Should we sign off or what?
[01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.790]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.530]  Should we wait until the cutscene's over?
[01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:08.870]  I don't know. Can I end the video?
[01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:10.330]  Are you hearing us?
[01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.750]  How do I even end this video? I can't hear them anymore.
[01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:13.910]  Oh my God.
[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.550]  God, it's the worst.
[01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:17.830]  I did not think he was going to say aftershave.
[01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.430]  He's an elite speaking gamer.
[01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.630]  I can still hear us.
[01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:25.650]  Are we going to see every soldier?
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:28.370]  Air through the outro and then message me when the outro's done.
[01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.210]  Guys, thank you so much for listening and watching.
[01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:33.890]  And are you a full-spectrum warrior?
[01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.470]  Let us know in the comments
[01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.150]  if you made it
[01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.670]  all the way to the bitter fucking end
[01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.270]  of what this is.
[01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:44.010]  Listen to the podcast
[01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:46.470]  and watch the videos. Check us out on Patreon.
[01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:48.890]  Regulation podcast.
[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.390]  Oh man.
[01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.470]  Patreon.com
[01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:55.590]  slash regulation pod, I think.
[01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:58.190]  Now you can hear us?
[01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.790]  Yeah, now I can hear you.
[01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:00.630]  Oh my God!
[01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.750]  Where have you been?
[01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:04.250]  I don't know where you guys have been.
[01:11:04.350 --> 01:11:07.010]  You were gone for a full minute.
[01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:09.930]  The video froze. You were gone for a full minute.
[01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:11.650]  Then all of a sudden we could hear you.
[01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:13.410]  But it was like...
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.150]  You in the past.
[01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:17.490]  Yeah, and then it all caught up and now we can just hear each other.
[01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:18.070]  Now we're back.
[01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:21.570]  So, level one.
[01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:23.290]  Level one.
[01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:24.330]  It's about Philly.
[01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.770]  He's a Jewish kid from the Philadelphia hood.
[01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:29.530]  Is it going to introduce us to
[01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:31.650]  every single person in the United States military?
[01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:32.310]  Yeah.
[01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:35.650]  Would they show you on here?
[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:36.610]  We know it's gone too far.
[01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:39.630]  This is like
[01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.650]  halftime at the Army-Navy game when you get all the
[01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:42.210]  fucking...
[01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:43.850]  Hi moms.
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.410]  Geoff aka T-Bone.
[01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:51.310]  Oh shit!
[01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:52.050]  Oh shit!
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:54.750]  This is what we saw in E3.
[01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:56.630]  NYPD, huh?
[01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:58.650]  Is that 3rd Infantry Division?
[01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:01.250]  I think it is.
[01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:04.410]  Don't just stand there.
[01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:06.770]  Hit the black button and then move
[01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.750]  over and hit the white button.
[01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:10.290]  Geoff remembers his army.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:12.270]  That's the 3rd Infantry Division we're watching, fellas.
[01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:15.290]  Okay, we're done.
[01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:18.810]  But you have to exit because we need to try
[01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:20.430]  snap, snap, nail...
[01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.850]  Whatever.
[01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:22.770]  Oh my god.
[01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:24.010]  And a Panasnail.
[01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:26.790]  Now we're just in a different
[01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:27.730]  resolution cutscene.
[01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:28.570]  Yes.
[01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:33.790]  Oh my god.
[01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:35.270]  Is that our tank?
[01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.770]  Yeah.
[01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.190]  We're gonna retreat.
[01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.370]  What would redeploy mean?
[01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.990]  Please don't.
[01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:43.110]  Don't do it.
[01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:48.950]  That's fine.
[01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:49.850]  It remembered.
[01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:51.990]  See, it plays.
[01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:56.750]  Okay, so go to cheat codes.
[01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:58.210]  Alright, got it.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.730]  A Pan.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.670]  A-P-A-N.
[01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:04.870]  A-P-A-N.
[01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.690]  P-A-P-A.
[01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:09.090]  P-A...
[01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:11.230]  P-A...
[01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:12.810]  S... I'm sorry, hang on.
[01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.370]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:16.210]  N-S-N.
[01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:18.670]  N-S-N.
[01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:19.290]  N-S-N.
[01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:20.890]  A-L-E.
[01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.530]  A-L-E.
[01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:24.290]  The number nine.
[01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:29.390]  Okay.
[01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:30.190]  This game sucks.
[01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:31.110]  Try this one.
[01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:33.770]  Clear it.
[01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:36.670]  Nick?
[01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:37.710]  N-I-C-K?
[01:13:38.670 --> 01:13:40.170]  You son of a bitch.
[01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:41.710]  You been holding out on us?
[01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:43.830]  I didn't know this.
[01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:46.110]  West. W-E-S-T.
[01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:49.530]  West. W-E-S-T.
[01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:51.110]  What if that's Nick's alter ego?
[01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:52.230]  That'd be cool.
[01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:55.510]  Okay, that one...
[01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:56.450]  That's big head mode.
[01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:58.890]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:01.450]  Alright, guys, thank you so much for watching. Are you a full Spectrum Warrior?
[01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:04.210]  Let us know. Andrew's gonna deploy into the sea if big head mode worked.
[01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:05.830]  He's gonna skip the cutscene, though.
[01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:07.150]  Please, God, for the love of God.
[01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.290]  Oh, hell yeah!
[01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:10.690]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:13.570]  Gavin had access to all of these codes earlier.
[01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:15.430]  Why did he not give us big head mode?
[01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:16.670]  I don't know.
[01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.190]  Insane!
[01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:19.710]  Alright, guys, thank you so much.
[01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:22.690]  This has been, uh...
[01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.770]  A video.
[01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:25.150]  This has been a video.
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:28.290]  Just for the love of God, say bye!
[01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:29.570]  Just let us leave!
[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:32.590]  It's almost done, but guys, it's really important
[01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:33.870]  that you want to come through.
[01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.870]  You want to support us, you can.

[01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.730]  like this one.

[01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.510]  and let a friend know and say I'm a full spectrum warrior
[01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:55.110]  in the comments.
[01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:58.250]  Yeah, say I'm an active gamer and a full spectrum warrior
[01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:59.410]  and that's how we'll know.
[01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:02.530]  That's how we know you made it to the end.
[01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:03.290]  Are you blowing up chickens?
[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.990]  Okay, we'll see you next time. Bye!
[01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:06.050]  Bye!
