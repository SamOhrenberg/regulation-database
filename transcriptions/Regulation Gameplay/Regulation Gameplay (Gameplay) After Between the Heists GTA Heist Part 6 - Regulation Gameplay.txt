[00:02.490 --> 00:03.590]  Nick, get in this car.
[00:07.730 --> 00:08.090]  What?!
[00:09.290 --> 00:10.690]  Brucie, shut up!
[00:12.270 --> 00:13.790]  Oh, for God's sake, I went to the wrong door.
[00:13.870 --> 00:15.210]  Get in! What are you doing?
[00:16.050 --> 00:16.770]  He's driving!
[00:17.810 --> 00:18.230]  Let's go!
[00:18.630 --> 00:20.230]  That's why he's here! Oh my God!
[00:27.230 --> 00:28.950]  How much did that cost you?
[00:29.290 --> 00:30.710]  How much did that cost you for my car?
[00:32.750 --> 00:34.070]  More than the strip club.
[00:39.170 --> 00:39.850]  That was so...
[00:39.850 --> 00:40.750]  Hey, welcome to...
[00:40.750 --> 00:41.730]  That was so awesome.
[00:42.570 --> 00:45.030]  Welcome to After the Heist, also called The Heist.
[00:46.690 --> 00:47.530]  Or Before the Heist.
[00:47.550 --> 00:48.750]  Welcome to After Between the Heists.
[00:52.890 --> 00:53.990]  Our new series.
[00:56.030 --> 00:57.610]  Oh my God, go pick up Nick.
[00:58.330 --> 00:59.510]  Let's go. I mean, let's go.
[01:00.410 --> 01:01.130]  Let's go.
[01:02.630 --> 01:04.990]  Man, this is a downgraded vehicle, isn't it?
[01:04.990 --> 01:05.610]  Get in!
[01:06.110 --> 01:07.810]  I'm getting in the damn car!
[01:08.190 --> 01:08.870]  Where's Andrew?
[01:09.710 --> 01:11.710]  I'm driving to his house already, I guess.
[01:12.510 --> 01:13.770]  You could just warp there.
[01:14.390 --> 01:16.210]  How do I warp? Explain to me how I do it.
[01:16.530 --> 01:17.150]  Tell me how I do it.
[01:19.810 --> 01:22.010]  Classic. See? Classic Gavin.
[01:22.590 --> 01:24.830]  Hey, just fix your audio, idiot.
[01:25.210 --> 01:26.630]  I don't know how to. Tell me how.
[01:27.390 --> 01:27.830]  Nothing.
[01:28.050 --> 01:29.410]  I've never done it myself, but...
[01:29.410 --> 01:30.350]  Exactly!
[01:30.830 --> 01:31.750]  You're drowning!
[01:31.970 --> 01:32.330]  Not exactly.
[01:32.970 --> 01:35.150]  Why is a $7000 bounty on me?
[01:36.330 --> 01:37.470]  Did you wrong someone?
[01:37.810 --> 01:39.730]  It just said you fucked with the wrong people.
[01:40.030 --> 01:40.570]  And it's like...
[01:40.570 --> 01:41.950]  Oh, you probably stole a car.
[01:42.390 --> 01:42.910]  Let's get in this.
[01:42.950 --> 01:44.370]  I'm in your car!
[01:47.270 --> 01:47.770]  Uh...
[01:47.770 --> 01:48.070]  Yeah.
[01:50.730 --> 01:51.490]  We're switching.
[01:59.120 --> 01:59.380]  Huh.
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.700]  Well, uh...
[02:01.700 --> 02:01.980]  Goodbye.
[02:02.080 --> 02:02.500]  Climb in the back.
[02:02.620 --> 02:03.260]  Jump in.
[02:05.320 --> 02:05.920]  Alright.
[02:06.300 --> 02:07.120]  Alright, let's go.
[02:08.860 --> 02:10.200]  Oh, shit!
[02:10.460 --> 02:11.160]  Oh my god.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.720]  That's alright.
[02:16.420 --> 02:16.780]  I'm okay.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.900]  Take this electric box.
[02:19.820 --> 02:20.260]  What?
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.240]  This thing.
[02:22.380 --> 02:23.980]  Take this electric box?
[02:25.320 --> 02:26.620]  I don't know what that's called.
[02:26.780 --> 02:26.900]  What?
[02:27.100 --> 02:27.220]  Generator.
[02:32.910 --> 02:33.890]  I'm just trying to...
[02:38.810 --> 02:40.290]  I'm just trying to get a wheel up, you know?
[02:40.410 --> 02:40.830]  Oh, there we go.
[02:45.390 --> 02:45.910]  Whoops.
[02:48.930 --> 02:50.250]  Oh, man.
[02:50.270 --> 02:51.110]  We're down here, huh?
[02:51.690 --> 02:52.770]  Why'd you get out?
[02:56.910 --> 02:58.090]  Why'd you get out?
[02:58.510 --> 02:59.690]  We have to go.
[03:00.870 --> 03:01.830]  Nick started something.
[03:04.170 --> 03:04.690]  What?
[03:04.990 --> 03:05.690]  What happened?
[03:05.690 --> 03:06.050]  What?
[03:08.730 --> 03:10.050]  You guys need a ride?
[03:10.130 --> 03:10.610]  I'll come down.
[03:11.330 --> 03:13.050]  I'm gonna go to my other vehicle.
[03:13.510 --> 03:14.230]  What vehicle?
[03:15.030 --> 03:15.830]  Bastard man.
[03:17.330 --> 03:18.130]  Do you see it?
[03:19.630 --> 03:20.970]  Yeah, I'm going back to shore.
[03:21.990 --> 03:23.230]  You're not gonna come to my vehicle?
[03:23.410 --> 03:23.770]  No!
[03:30.190 --> 03:30.670]  Yes.
[03:30.850 --> 03:31.510]  Nick, yes.
[03:32.350 --> 03:33.090]  Nick, yes.
[03:33.270 --> 03:33.410]  Oh!
[03:33.410 --> 03:34.850]  Someone's shooting my vehicle with stuff.
[03:34.870 --> 03:35.210]  Nick, yes.
[03:35.890 --> 03:36.730]  What happened?
[03:38.110 --> 03:39.150]  There's a hole in it.
[03:39.150 --> 03:41.250]  You're making it all go gammy.
[03:44.390 --> 03:45.770]  What's happening out there?
[03:46.130 --> 03:46.890]  What's happening, Gavin?
[03:48.610 --> 03:50.090]  The ship's vibrating.
[03:52.510 --> 03:53.730]  Oh, a Series A funding.
[03:54.650 --> 03:55.670]  Eric, are you still on the beach?
[03:56.290 --> 03:56.630]  Yeah.
[03:58.290 --> 03:58.790]  Sweet.
[04:01.230 --> 04:02.250]  Gavin, I'm right here.
[04:02.730 --> 04:02.990]  Gavin.
[04:03.330 --> 04:04.510]  That's an oddly...
[04:04.510 --> 04:05.650]  Gavin, I'm right here.
[04:06.490 --> 04:06.730]  Gavin.
[04:06.870 --> 04:07.130]  No!
[04:12.190 --> 04:14.750]  Hey, Andrew invited me to a Series A funding. Here we go.
[04:14.950 --> 04:16.250]  Hey, there you go.
[04:16.370 --> 04:17.170]  A Series A funding.
[04:18.350 --> 04:19.390]  Series A funding.
[04:19.770 --> 04:19.910]  Yep.
[04:22.990 --> 04:23.730]  Fucking Mario.
[04:24.230 --> 04:28.290]  Listen, it's not a pyramid scheme, but I need us to get into a Series A funding.
[04:28.470 --> 04:29.530]  I need a Series A funding.
[04:32.430 --> 04:35.170]  Get some of that armor, some of that ammo.
[04:36.010 --> 04:37.710]  It's like between the Heist naming convention.
[04:39.970 --> 04:45.810]  Is this the heist that I was in the middle of, that I had to cancel out of when we first started this?
[04:46.290 --> 04:46.590]  Is it?
[04:46.790 --> 04:47.370]  You tell us.
[04:47.730 --> 04:50.130]  I think so. I think we're about to get Trevor and all that.
[04:51.590 --> 04:52.270]  Why do I need that?
[04:53.630 --> 04:58.650]  So all these original five heists take place before the main game, and then everything else after that is after. Is that right?
[04:59.850 --> 05:02.710]  I have no idea where these heists line up chronologically.
[05:03.450 --> 05:06.290]  Yeah, I think it's all a prequel. Until some point.
[05:06.990 --> 05:09.830]  So is this the middle of a heist, then, or the beginning?
[05:10.650 --> 05:11.130]  It's the beginning.
[05:12.690 --> 05:15.670]  This is kind of crazy, though, because they made it sound like Trevor had been in hiding.
[05:15.990 --> 05:19.230]  Well, not been hiding, but just been living way up north and never came across Michael.
[05:19.390 --> 05:23.250]  And now he's just down south in the same city as Michael? Crazy.
[05:24.290 --> 05:24.650]  Insane.
[05:28.510 --> 05:29.470]  Can't skip it.
[05:36.850 --> 05:38.830]  We should get a shirt that says TTI.
[05:39.970 --> 05:40.370]  Yeah?
[05:40.630 --> 05:41.890]  And it's just Team Tape Industries.
[05:42.070 --> 05:45.430]  Oh, Team Tape, dude! Oh, fuck it, I know about Team Tape, hell yeah.
[05:46.350 --> 05:47.090]  NBI, baby.
[05:49.030 --> 05:49.790]  Bad ideas?
[05:51.030 --> 05:51.370]  No bad ideas.
[05:51.410 --> 05:51.810]  NBI.
[05:52.130 --> 05:53.290]  Oh, no bad ideas.
[05:55.610 --> 05:56.010]  NBI.
[05:56.670 --> 05:57.430]  Can you skip this?
[05:58.250 --> 06:00.110]  No, that's what I said a minute ago.
[06:00.490 --> 06:01.650]  Yeah, but can you actually skip it?
[06:02.310 --> 06:02.850]  Eh, no.
[06:03.410 --> 06:04.070]  Wish I could.
[06:04.070 --> 06:09.790]  I think it's funny that he doesn't like people calling him Trevor and being all about this.
[06:12.030 --> 06:13.070]  Just embrace it.
[06:13.810 --> 06:14.290]  Oh, the actor?
[06:15.030 --> 06:16.330]  Yeah, the actor hates it.
[06:18.130 --> 06:19.510]  But that was like...
[06:19.510 --> 06:24.030]  Yeah, but that's like people walking up to Gavin going, like, hey, you're Mark Nutt, or whatever.
[06:25.690 --> 06:27.170]  Gavin, does that happen often?
[06:28.770 --> 06:32.070]  I mean, it's been a while since I've had a Mark Nutt scream to me, but...
[06:32.070 --> 06:34.910]  But has anyone walked up to you and said, hey, you're Mark Nutt?
[06:38.150 --> 06:39.150]  It's you, Mark Nutt.
[06:39.170 --> 06:39.890]  I don't think so.
[06:40.030 --> 06:42.810]  Hey, Mark Nutt. Hey, everybody, Mark Nutt is here.
[06:43.090 --> 06:50.650]  When you give your face to one of the most popular games ever on Earth, there's a certain amount of sacrifice that you're going to have to deal with there.
[06:50.970 --> 06:51.370]  Mark Nutt.
[06:53.230 --> 06:55.450]  Oh, my favorite game.
[06:57.150 --> 06:58.330]  The Pills and the Meds?
[06:58.450 --> 06:58.750]  Yeah.
[07:01.450 --> 07:02.250]  Hey, they're leaving.
[07:02.990 --> 07:03.350]  Sweet.
[07:03.610 --> 07:05.170]  All right, what should we do first? Coke?
[07:05.610 --> 07:05.950]  Yeah.
[07:06.010 --> 07:06.410]  Oh, Coke.
[07:06.750 --> 07:07.650]  Oh, it's on the boat.
[07:07.990 --> 07:09.530]  You don't even have to ask, Gavin.
[07:10.290 --> 07:11.370]  What should we do first, Coke?
[07:11.590 --> 07:12.270]  Absolutely, bud.
[07:12.450 --> 07:12.890]  Let's do it.
[07:13.670 --> 07:14.710]  Eric's going back to the club.
[07:16.030 --> 07:17.850]  Take me back to Vanilla Unicorn.
[07:18.270 --> 07:18.630]  Now!
[07:19.670 --> 07:20.530]  Oh, oh!
[07:21.630 --> 07:22.910]  Outfit, bandana, street.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.010]  Uh-oh, helicopter.
[07:24.490 --> 07:25.170]  Duct tape!
[07:26.050 --> 07:28.130]  So, do I have to be on the helicopter team, you think?
[07:28.510 --> 07:28.830]  Wait.
[07:29.010 --> 07:30.130]  Oh, yeah, how do you swap to that?
[07:30.190 --> 07:33.030]  No, me and Gavin need to be on helicopter. Me and Gavin are in, dude.
[07:33.410 --> 07:34.650]  But you can't. I'm the pilot.
[07:35.050 --> 07:36.230]  Nick and I can swap to helicopter.
[07:37.290 --> 07:37.990]  Fine, go fly fly.
[07:39.350 --> 07:40.550]  How did you swap, Nick?
[07:40.870 --> 07:41.910]  You go up to view team.
[07:42.410 --> 07:43.790]  Oh, join team. I see, I see, okay.
[07:44.110 --> 07:45.170]  Hey, we're all copper.
[07:45.370 --> 07:46.790]  Why are we all in this?
[07:47.090 --> 07:47.830]  Fuck the boat.
[07:48.410 --> 07:48.730]  What?
[07:49.650 --> 07:50.610]  We need people on the boat.
[07:51.390 --> 07:52.150]  You two go boat.
[07:52.570 --> 07:56.370]  You mean that we're not on the team that we started on and now we have to move team?
[07:56.370 --> 07:57.190]  Why do we...
[07:57.190 --> 08:00.450]  Okay, well, do you want not, not, want, want, want, not, Nick?
[08:00.450 --> 08:01.230]  What the fuck?
[08:01.550 --> 08:02.650]  Are you okay?
[08:03.450 --> 08:03.930]  Are you...
[08:03.930 --> 08:06.090]  Do you want Nick to fly or no?
[08:06.350 --> 08:06.550]  Yeah.
[08:06.650 --> 08:07.010]  Yes.
[08:07.950 --> 08:09.410]  Okay, well, then you guys gotta go boat.
[08:09.450 --> 08:11.050]  All right, all right, me and you, boat.
[08:12.510 --> 08:13.710]  How do I move?
[08:13.830 --> 08:17.730]  Gavin, you just go up to the, to the top thing where it says helicopter, change to boat.
[08:18.310 --> 08:18.830]  Got it.
[08:19.170 --> 08:20.330]  I don't know fly fly.
[08:21.310 --> 08:23.470]  I mean, you're just, like, making noise at...
[08:24.090 --> 08:25.150]  Like, I don't even know what's happening.
[08:25.830 --> 08:27.290]  Uh, do we do on street?
[08:27.510 --> 08:28.650]  I think we gotta do street, right?
[08:29.130 --> 08:30.370]  Oh, I like the bag look.
[08:30.810 --> 08:31.610]  I do too.
[08:31.770 --> 08:32.870]  Yeah, I think team tape's back.
[08:33.590 --> 08:34.150]  Team bag.
[08:34.590 --> 08:35.130]  Oh, I like this.
[08:35.150 --> 08:36.890]  Oh, there's no, there's no caution tape, weird.
[08:38.930 --> 08:39.450]  Is there not?
[08:39.510 --> 08:40.850]  Oh, no, you have to go over to tape.
[08:41.190 --> 08:42.530]  It's, you're, you're in duct tape.
[08:42.830 --> 08:43.370]  And then there's...
[08:43.370 --> 08:44.050]  I'm in duct tape.
[08:44.190 --> 08:44.310]  Yep.
[08:44.430 --> 08:45.750]  I wanted to try out the rainbow tape.
[08:45.990 --> 08:46.490]  I like it.
[08:47.510 --> 08:47.910]  Dude, I'm...
[08:47.910 --> 08:48.830]  Oh, I like it, it looks good.
[08:49.150 --> 08:50.570]  I think I, I think I might like this.
[08:51.090 --> 08:52.390]  I think, I think I might like...
[08:52.390 --> 08:54.790]  Guys, guys, I'm starting to think...
[08:54.790 --> 08:56.710]  Yeah, I like this.
[08:57.730 --> 08:58.850]  Uh, I'm doing crime scene.
[08:59.590 --> 08:59.830]  That's...
[08:59.830 --> 09:00.590]  Okay, now I'm ready.
[09:01.590 --> 09:03.810]  Has anyone ever, like, heat-shrinked their head?
[09:04.630 --> 09:05.490]  Uh, we can be the first.
[09:05.730 --> 09:08.430]  Why did we spend all that time if we don't have the masks on?
[09:08.850 --> 09:09.870]  You put it on when you get there.
[09:09.870 --> 09:11.390]  We pull them, we pull the masks on, yeah.
[09:12.790 --> 09:15.250]  I'm sick of this game being halfway with masks.
[09:15.590 --> 09:16.390]  Let me have masks.
[09:17.370 --> 09:17.730]  Well...
[09:17.730 --> 09:20.310]  They don't want you to draw attention to yourself on the way.
[09:20.930 --> 09:22.470]  Andrew, I think we have to go to the same spot.
[09:22.670 --> 09:22.870]  Yep.
[09:23.690 --> 09:24.050]  Okay.
[09:24.130 --> 09:25.090]  I'm gonna get in this BF.
[09:26.730 --> 09:27.450]  Let's do it, bud.
[09:27.610 --> 09:29.210]  Team, team chopper in route.
[09:29.390 --> 09:30.130]  I got, I said it.
[09:30.130 --> 09:30.970]  Oh my god, I got hit.
[09:31.110 --> 09:31.710]  Sorry, fellas.
[09:32.410 --> 09:32.670]  Oh.
[09:33.230 --> 09:34.430]  There you go, Andrew, I gotcha.
[09:35.050 --> 09:35.730]  Thanks, Nick.
[09:36.510 --> 09:37.230]  Thanks, man.
[09:38.610 --> 09:40.110]  Excuse me, pardon, coming through.
[09:40.310 --> 09:40.630]  Excuse me.
[09:40.650 --> 09:41.110]  I gotcha!
[09:41.230 --> 09:41.630]  Oh, no.
[09:41.790 --> 09:42.690]  Whoa, someone's upside down.
[09:43.110 --> 09:44.010]  It's alright, it's alright.
[09:44.550 --> 09:44.790]  Physics.
[09:45.470 --> 09:45.750]  Oh!
[09:47.250 --> 09:47.610]  Woo!
[09:47.730 --> 09:48.490]  This ain't four.
[09:48.710 --> 09:49.750]  This car, this car is fine.
[09:50.910 --> 09:51.490]  Hang a right.
[09:51.490 --> 09:52.450]  Oh, you missed it.
[09:52.710 --> 09:53.350]  Where are you going?
[09:53.650 --> 09:54.510]  Was I supposed to go right?
[09:54.670 --> 09:56.710]  I mean, do you not see my marker?
[09:57.070 --> 09:58.170]  Yeah, I was just following them.
[09:58.290 --> 09:59.110]  What was I supposed to go from?
[10:01.330 --> 10:01.970]  I don't...
[10:01.970 --> 10:04.770]  So wait, you see it, and then you just didn't...
[10:04.770 --> 10:06.250]  I don't even know what to tell you.
[10:06.990 --> 10:08.130]  Maybe we have a different route.
[10:08.770 --> 10:12.390]  My map was big, which made the line tiny, and I was just following the car in front.
[10:14.770 --> 10:15.330]  Team tape.
[10:16.110 --> 10:16.570]  Team tape.
[10:17.790 --> 10:18.650]  Hey, you know what, Gavin?
[10:18.690 --> 10:19.810]  That sounds like a no bad idea.
[10:23.670 --> 10:24.810]  Why'd that car go there?
[10:25.270 --> 10:26.090]  Oh, boy!
[10:26.770 --> 10:27.570]  We're accepting offers.
[10:28.270 --> 10:28.730]  Oh, nice.
[10:29.950 --> 10:31.250]  That was pretty cool.
[10:36.670 --> 10:37.550]  Quip mask.
[10:38.750 --> 10:39.690]  Oh, you're a quippin' already?
[10:40.250 --> 10:40.450]  Yep.
[10:42.070 --> 10:42.950]  You ready?
[10:43.090 --> 10:43.270]  Oh, God.
[10:44.130 --> 10:45.130]  On the other side.
[10:45.870 --> 10:46.770]  Alright, let's go to the beach.
[10:46.770 --> 10:47.230]  Oh, God.
[10:47.230 --> 10:48.230]  Oh, God.
[10:50.890 --> 10:54.950]  Andrew, that could've been a lot different.
[10:55.210 --> 10:57.050]  That was, yeah, that was dangerous.
[10:57.070 --> 10:58.450]  That could've been a lot different.
[10:58.570 --> 10:59.290]  Oh, we boatin', baby.
[10:59.410 --> 11:00.290]  That could've been real bad.
[11:00.390 --> 11:01.090]  Boat, baby!
[11:01.270 --> 11:02.350]  Why would you run into it?
[11:04.650 --> 11:05.430]  It's our boat.
[11:07.770 --> 11:09.230]  Oh, my vehicle got destroyed.
[11:09.690 --> 11:10.070]  Good.
[11:12.490 --> 11:13.270]  I put my mask on.
[11:13.270 --> 11:13.470]  You see that?
[11:15.090 --> 11:15.670]  Yeah, how do I do that?
[11:15.910 --> 11:16.730]  Left on the D-pad.
[11:16.730 --> 11:17.910]  Is mine on?
[11:18.070 --> 11:18.470]  I can't see.
[11:19.270 --> 11:19.330]  Yes.
[11:19.650 --> 11:20.350]  I think so.
[11:20.690 --> 11:22.750]  If you go first person, Eric, do I look cool?
[11:23.170 --> 11:23.870]  Uh, let's see.
[11:23.930 --> 11:24.170]  Hang on.
[11:25.370 --> 11:27.030]  Oh, yeah, you look fuckin' awesome.
[11:27.950 --> 11:28.570]  You see the tape?
[11:28.830 --> 11:29.930]  Yeah, you got the tape.
[11:30.110 --> 11:31.450]  You're flying in, like, a boat.
[11:31.590 --> 11:33.610]  I see the sea, and then I see the air, baby.
[11:34.530 --> 11:35.750]  Alright, are we coordinating the attack?
[11:35.970 --> 11:36.590]  Yeah, coordinated.
[11:36.710 --> 11:36.890]  Go.
[11:36.990 --> 11:38.290]  Yeah, we're landed.
[11:38.730 --> 11:39.530]  Oh, my God.
[11:39.990 --> 11:40.350]  Engage!
[11:40.590 --> 11:41.330]  You guys are on.
[11:44.210 --> 11:44.650]  Aaaahhh!
[11:46.410 --> 11:46.850]  Goddamn.
[11:48.830 --> 11:49.330]  What happened?
[11:49.670 --> 11:50.590]  Someone died?
[11:50.630 --> 11:51.110]  Andrew's dead.
[11:51.810 --> 11:52.690]  Andrew, what happened?
[11:52.710 --> 11:54.110]  That's not a good place to land.
[11:54.310 --> 11:56.290]  It's not a good place to land.
[11:57.030 --> 11:58.230]  So, do you have any guns on that thing?
[11:58.750 --> 11:59.030]  No.
[11:59.250 --> 11:59.530]  No.
[12:01.210 --> 12:04.410]  Well, maybe we'll wait until they're...
[12:04.410 --> 12:05.750]  Let's wait until they're there.
[12:06.490 --> 12:08.010]  Yeah, it should be a coordinated attack.
[12:08.110 --> 12:10.170]  I mean, we came in right when you guys came in.
[12:10.790 --> 12:13.930]  We'll let you guys dock first, and then we'll land.
[12:15.610 --> 12:19.410]  So you scream, we're here, and then we'll be okay.
[12:19.890 --> 12:22.110]  Should we strap bombs to this boat and dive out?
[12:23.590 --> 12:24.030]  Yes.
[12:25.810 --> 12:27.170]  You wanna bomb it up?
[12:28.290 --> 12:28.870]  Yeah, big time.
[12:30.650 --> 12:32.130]  Alright Andrew, that was good, except for the dying.
[12:34.070 --> 12:37.470]  I wasn't expecting it to be so hot as soon as we landed.
[12:37.590 --> 12:38.750]  Hang on, hang on, give me a second.
[12:40.170 --> 12:40.950]  Okay, alright, now we're good.
[12:41.310 --> 12:42.210]  Alright, we're on our way?
[12:43.130 --> 12:43.790]  We're on our way.
[12:43.970 --> 12:44.830]  We can go under that dock, right?
[12:45.410 --> 12:46.110]  Yeah, sure can.
[12:48.950 --> 12:49.750]  Alright, fellas.
[12:50.370 --> 12:53.990]  Alright, so we'll hit the back, we'll go up, we'll jump out, and kaboomies.
[12:54.410 --> 12:54.810]  Absolutely.
[12:57.390 --> 12:58.750]  Alright, coordination team.
[12:59.230 --> 13:00.850]  Give me a countdown when we see you.
[13:01.050 --> 13:01.610]  We're coming in.
[13:01.970 --> 13:02.630]  Coming in now.
[13:02.650 --> 13:03.190]  Go when you're ready, baby.
[13:06.250 --> 13:08.950]  Three, two, one, jump!
[13:10.190 --> 13:10.810]  I jumped!
[13:11.410 --> 13:12.530]  That looked pretty cool from up here.
[13:12.550 --> 13:13.750]  I just straight back on it.
[13:14.150 --> 13:14.870]  Ah, shit.
[13:15.450 --> 13:16.210]  Alright, I'm climbing up.
[13:20.520 --> 13:21.560]  That was pretty cool.
[13:23.560 --> 13:24.980]  Bit of a delayed explosion.
[13:25.920 --> 13:26.740]  It happens.
[13:27.880 --> 13:29.280]  Get your shins shot, son.
[13:30.140 --> 13:30.680]  Alright, Andrew.
[13:31.080 --> 13:32.020]  I'm taking them all out.
[13:32.120 --> 13:32.480]  Safely landed.
[13:33.860 --> 13:34.940]  Oh, nice landing, guys.
[13:35.520 --> 13:36.460]  Oh, it's not me.
[13:36.460 --> 13:36.920]  It's not.
[13:37.360 --> 13:38.100]  It's not.
[13:38.740 --> 13:39.460]  Be careful.
[13:40.160 --> 13:40.860]  Be careful.
[13:40.860 --> 13:41.780]  Be careful!
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.760]  There's a lot going on.
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.320]  I hope we didn't need the chop.
[13:47.400 --> 13:48.700]  Wait, we could have just crashed it?
[13:48.740 --> 13:49.420]  Who gives a shit?
[13:49.760 --> 13:49.920]  Yeah.
[13:51.020 --> 13:52.600]  Oh, these guys have money.
[13:56.500 --> 13:57.680]  Got some coke.
[13:58.360 --> 13:58.960]  You got the coke?
[13:59.140 --> 13:59.520]  Got some.
[14:00.900 --> 14:01.580]  There's more.
[14:02.700 --> 14:03.680]  Got another one.
[14:04.560 --> 14:05.100]  Doing good.
[14:05.520 --> 14:06.320]  Oh, Andrew, watch out!
[14:07.700 --> 14:08.140]  Outside.
[14:08.900 --> 14:09.780]  There he is.
[14:09.780 --> 14:14.760]  Look at the green on your map, if it's above or below.
[14:15.840 --> 14:16.200]  Cocaine!
[14:16.780 --> 14:21.360]  I think I took everything from the inside cabin that we can get.
[14:22.040 --> 14:22.580]  Alright, I'll get this.
[14:22.740 --> 14:24.880]  So now we need to head towards the front of the boat.
[14:25.640 --> 14:27.520]  I can be at the back and go above.
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.780]  Am I getting shot from a chopper?
[14:28.960 --> 14:29.360]  Yeah, probably.
[14:30.920 --> 14:32.180]  Let me see what I can do about it.
[14:34.780 --> 14:35.540]  Oh, health.
[14:36.080 --> 14:36.240]  Yeah.
[14:37.220 --> 14:37.580]  Needed.
[14:37.760 --> 14:38.120]  Necessary.
[14:39.980 --> 14:40.340]  Holy!
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.440]  I got it!
[14:42.780 --> 14:43.140]  Goddamn!
[14:44.020 --> 14:44.540]  I got some.
[14:44.580 --> 14:45.340]  Yeah, you definitely got it.
[14:45.340 --> 14:46.020]  Put some clothes on!
[14:47.020 --> 14:47.680]  Oh, God.
[14:47.820 --> 14:48.200]  Oh, God.
[14:48.280 --> 14:50.380]  I can't climb up because of the fucking helicopter tail.
[14:50.680 --> 14:50.880]  Oh!
[14:52.980 --> 14:53.700]  Oh, you can't.
[14:53.780 --> 14:55.460]  What the hell are people talking about?
[14:55.520 --> 14:57.060]  You can get armor from this fucking menu.
[14:57.320 --> 14:58.460]  Oh, I see.
[14:58.580 --> 14:58.680]  Ow!
[14:59.700 --> 15:00.500]  Gavin, no!
[15:00.680 --> 15:01.360]  Gavin, no!
[15:04.780 --> 15:05.500]  What happened?
[15:05.580 --> 15:07.060]  That was a way better run that time.
[15:07.200 --> 15:07.600]  Yeah, my bad.
[15:08.120 --> 15:09.560]  Andrew, do you want to just parachute in?
[15:10.720 --> 15:11.780]  Yeah, we can parachute in.
[15:11.940 --> 15:12.240]  Okay.
[15:12.560 --> 15:15.200]  Oh, I got a surveillance camera to film you guys going in.
[15:15.460 --> 15:16.700]  Oh, it's like a TV show.
[15:16.780 --> 15:17.340]  Where are you going?
[15:17.520 --> 15:18.360]  Where are you going?
[15:18.580 --> 15:19.760]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[15:20.960 --> 15:22.220]  It's like a news chopper.
[15:22.960 --> 15:23.880]  Oh, you can see us?
[15:24.320 --> 15:24.640]  Yeah.
[15:24.880 --> 15:25.500]  We're right above you.
[15:25.660 --> 15:25.980]  It's a surveillance camera.
[15:27.660 --> 15:28.060]  Alright, are you ready?
[15:28.360 --> 15:28.680]  Yep.
[15:28.920 --> 15:29.320]  Count it down.
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.740]  Okay, I'm going to get us right over and then I'll give us the go-ahead, okay?
[15:34.220 --> 15:34.480]  Okay.
[15:35.100 --> 15:35.220]  Jump out now!
[15:35.220 --> 15:37.580]  I'm thinking maybe the front of the yacht since they're going to the back.
[15:39.560 --> 15:39.920]  Alright, you ready?
[15:40.840 --> 15:41.000]  Yep.
[15:41.180 --> 15:41.500]  Let's do it!
[15:41.780 --> 15:42.980]  It's right above me.
[15:47.800 --> 15:49.000]  Alright, buddy, whenever you're ready.
[15:50.020 --> 15:50.780]  Oh, no.
[15:53.800 --> 15:54.680]  Gavin, what happened?
[15:55.660 --> 15:56.020]  Ah!
[15:56.320 --> 15:56.680]  Fuck!
[15:57.720 --> 15:58.260]  Why are you on the-
[15:58.260 --> 16:00.320]  I hit the side of the yacht and I fell in the water.
[16:00.440 --> 16:01.160]  I'm in the water.
[16:03.300 --> 16:04.720]  Parachuting was not a good idea.
[16:04.860 --> 16:05.580]  The chopper!
[16:05.840 --> 16:06.500]  You're in the sea?
[16:07.160 --> 16:07.460]  Ah!
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.450]  Okay, we're up.
[16:18.130 --> 16:18.830]  Eric, are you here?
[16:19.070 --> 16:19.810]  Yeah, I'm right.
[16:19.970 --> 16:22.130]  If you go down these stairs, I'm right here with you.
[16:22.930 --> 16:23.950]  Eric, are you here?
[16:24.130 --> 16:26.990]  Guys, you can re-equip armor in the weapons wheel.
[16:28.370 --> 16:29.430]  I always forget that.
[16:29.970 --> 16:30.610]  I didn't know you could do that.
[16:30.610 --> 16:31.250]  That's great to know.
[16:32.110 --> 16:36.190]  You can hold it and then just press down on- or press in the right-
[16:36.190 --> 16:39.110]  I think it tells you that every time you open the left wheel.
[16:39.470 --> 16:40.890]  And you can get snacks there, too.
[16:40.890 --> 16:41.270]  Oh, shit.
[16:41.270 --> 16:42.070]  Didn't know that.
[16:42.450 --> 16:43.310]  You got him, Gavin? You alright?
[16:44.290 --> 16:45.150]  Plug tub's empty.
[16:45.570 --> 16:46.890]  I read some comments. Thanks, guys.
[16:48.910 --> 16:49.610]  Grab that health.
[16:49.990 --> 16:50.650]  I got this coke.
[16:51.430 --> 16:52.670]  Okay, now we gotta move towards the-
[16:52.670 --> 16:54.990]  So we got everything that's down here, we gotta move towards the front of the boat.
[16:55.130 --> 16:58.130]  Oh, that's fucking Nick. You're terrifying me.
[16:58.450 --> 17:00.630]  Okay, we gotta move up and towards the front of the boat.
[17:03.130 --> 17:05.690]  Yeah, we were hoping to do that with the parachutes, but we fell in the water.
[17:05.770 --> 17:05.810]  I'm good!
[17:06.130 --> 17:07.570]  Oh, you're- I'm with you! Hell yeah!
[17:07.830 --> 17:08.910]  Yeah, it's us, yeah!
[17:10.110 --> 17:10.810]  Yeah, where's Gavin?
[17:10.810 --> 17:12.330]  We got the coke down here.
[17:12.730 --> 17:14.230]  Are you guys off the back of the boat?
[17:14.830 --> 17:15.930]  We're on the bottom of the boat.
[17:17.050 --> 17:17.370]  Ow!
[17:18.130 --> 17:19.130]  I'll take the chopper.
[17:20.290 --> 17:21.530]  Oh, that chopper's going down.
[17:22.390 --> 17:23.070]  Oh, never mind.
[17:23.290 --> 17:23.690]  Nice.
[17:24.190 --> 17:25.010]  Ow, ow, ow, ow!
[17:25.010 --> 17:25.690]  Good work.
[17:27.170 --> 17:28.870]  Okay, looking for the coke on this floor.
[17:35.450 --> 17:36.790]  Alright, the other chopper's down.
[17:42.120 --> 17:42.780]  Oh, shit!
[17:43.420 --> 17:43.720]  You alright?
[17:44.100 --> 17:45.120]  That's two for Andrew.
[17:45.620 --> 17:46.320]  That's two for me.
[17:47.520 --> 17:50.000]  Alright, we'll just land it this time, yeah?
[17:53.820 --> 17:54.880]  Parachuting was not a good idea.
[17:55.060 --> 17:59.100]  I hit the side of the yacht, and then just, like, cartwheeled into the sea.
[18:01.740 --> 18:02.520]  Let's do it, boys!
[18:02.840 --> 18:03.880]  Oh, I'm feeling good.
[18:04.060 --> 18:04.760]  Look good, feel good.
[18:05.660 --> 18:09.040]  Gavin, I don't think we need to blow up the boat, but I am still for it.
[18:09.320 --> 18:10.920]  Why don't we keep the boat this time?
[18:11.260 --> 18:12.740]  Oh, I kind of like that idea.
[18:13.240 --> 18:13.980]  We're changing it up.
[18:14.440 --> 18:14.960]  Team tape.
[18:16.080 --> 18:16.800]  Team tape.
[18:17.520 --> 18:18.240]  Series of coke.
[18:18.280 --> 18:19.300]  A series of coke.
[18:22.460 --> 18:23.960]  Took the words right out of my mouth, bud.
[18:31.240 --> 18:32.620]  Wait, is this boat different?
[18:33.100 --> 18:34.300]  Wait, wait, I'm not on the boat!
[18:35.480 --> 18:37.120]  You had ample time to get on the boat.
[18:37.300 --> 18:38.600]  Hey, I tried to get on the boat.
[18:38.780 --> 18:39.680]  It wouldn't, oh my god.
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.120]  Oh my god, let me get on the boat.
[18:41.460 --> 18:41.780]  Jesus Christ.
[18:42.080 --> 18:43.440]  Did you get in? That was great.
[18:43.540 --> 18:44.160]  That was scary.
[18:45.220 --> 18:46.440]  Go off the ramp, go off the ramp.
[18:46.900 --> 18:48.820]  Hitting the ramp, hitting the old sprunk ramp.
[18:50.200 --> 18:50.560]  Sprunk?
[18:50.820 --> 18:51.580]  Oh, boy.
[18:53.840 --> 18:54.360]  Oh, god.
[18:57.140 --> 18:58.100]  Okay, yeah, you're good.
[19:03.990 --> 19:04.790]  Oh, I landed!
[19:05.290 --> 19:05.990]  I landed!
[19:06.210 --> 19:07.030]  Oh, that was so cool!
[19:07.430 --> 19:08.350]  Oh, that was so cool!
[19:08.630 --> 19:09.730]  Oh, you're right next to a man.
[19:09.850 --> 19:10.090]  Oh, boy.
[19:11.010 --> 19:12.330]  Oh, that was so cool.
[19:12.550 --> 19:12.670]  Oh, boy.
[19:12.830 --> 19:13.570]  Oh, my god.
[19:13.810 --> 19:14.830]  Oh, that was awesome.
[19:15.270 --> 19:15.690]  Oh, boy.
[19:15.710 --> 19:16.390]  We're taking fire.
[19:16.390 --> 19:17.150]  Okay.
[19:17.270 --> 19:17.670]  Nick.
[19:18.010 --> 19:18.410]  Oh!
[19:19.130 --> 19:19.530]  Nick!
[19:20.230 --> 19:21.230]  He's got me in half!
[19:22.910 --> 19:23.270]  Oh, okay.
[19:23.590 --> 19:24.270]  Didn't need to heal.
[19:24.650 --> 19:26.570]  Dude, that was, oh, that was so sick.
[19:26.790 --> 19:28.630]  Gavin, I landed in there shooting people.
[19:28.770 --> 19:29.590]  Oh, that was awesome.
[19:29.770 --> 19:29.970]  Nick!
[19:30.450 --> 19:31.510]  That was our best run yet.
[19:31.610 --> 19:32.230]  What happened, guys?
[19:32.450 --> 19:33.450]  Wow, guys, what happened?
[19:35.970 --> 19:37.970]  Nick did not land it.
[19:38.030 --> 19:40.190]  He crashed us, and then he kept crashing.
[19:40.350 --> 19:44.250]  And I tried to get out, and the blade sliced me in half.
[19:46.390 --> 19:47.630]  Sorry, that was my fault.
[19:48.450 --> 19:51.770]  I got scared, so I bailed on the chopper.
[19:52.990 --> 19:54.250]  I got scared.
[19:55.630 --> 19:56.510]  I was scared.
[19:59.110 --> 19:59.750]  Oh, man.
[20:00.390 --> 20:01.030]  All right.
[20:02.230 --> 20:03.170]  We were coming in too hot.
[20:03.330 --> 20:03.770]  That was the problem.
[20:03.790 --> 20:04.230]  We got this.
[20:04.390 --> 20:05.110]  Yeah, we got this.
[20:06.370 --> 20:07.230]  All right, Gavin, you ready?
[20:07.350 --> 20:08.710]  I'm glad you guys had a great landing, though.
[20:09.230 --> 20:10.670]  Dude, it rocked.
[20:10.690 --> 20:11.690]  It was so cool.
[20:12.330 --> 20:13.650]  We've had a great landing every other time.
[20:13.670 --> 20:14.850]  What am I doing every time?
[20:14.850 --> 20:15.150]  I don't know.
[20:15.150 --> 20:16.790]  It was doing that for me, too.
[20:17.130 --> 20:17.890]  Now we're good.
[20:19.330 --> 20:22.510]  I think the sun's getting lower in the sky every time we try this.
[20:22.570 --> 20:24.090]  I think the sun's getting low on us, bud.
[20:24.710 --> 20:24.870]  Yeah.
[20:25.870 --> 20:27.310]  Oh, what a beautiful sunset, though.
[20:28.210 --> 20:28.790]  Is this the back of the ramp?
[20:28.790 --> 20:30.170]  And look, the Ferris wheel's on.
[20:34.210 --> 20:35.110]  No, no, no, no, no.
[20:35.230 --> 20:36.030]  Oh, my God.
[20:39.340 --> 20:40.580]  All right, y'all ready for piss?
[20:43.500 --> 20:44.660]  All right, all the way.
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.980]  All the way.
[20:47.600 --> 20:48.040]  Wallop.
[20:52.680 --> 20:53.560]  Holy shitballs.
[20:54.480 --> 20:55.440]  That was awesome.
[20:57.500 --> 20:58.100]  Guy right here, Gavin.
[21:02.940 --> 21:04.440]  You just came in out of nowhere.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.060]  I stomped him.
[21:06.800 --> 21:07.540]  I saved my friend.
[21:08.620 --> 21:09.760]  I had to save my buddy.
[21:09.820 --> 21:10.340]  It's a good landing.
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.120]  Let's get out.
[21:11.180 --> 21:11.840]  From tape to tape.
[21:14.180 --> 21:15.440]  Shot on all sides.
[21:15.620 --> 21:16.880]  That guy folded me up.
[21:16.880 --> 21:17.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:17.480 --> 21:18.500]  He got his head up his ass.
[21:19.560 --> 21:20.460]  Guy over here or what?
[21:20.560 --> 21:24.020]  Okay, I'm gonna come down here and get all the coke that's in this...
[21:24.020 --> 21:24.580]  Oh, shit!
[21:25.940 --> 21:26.300]  Yep.
[21:27.200 --> 21:29.760]  So, if you want to start working your way upstairs...
[21:29.920 --> 21:30.380]  Moving up.
[21:33.400 --> 21:34.120]  Oh, God.
[21:34.380 --> 21:35.260]  Put him on a table.
[21:37.060 --> 21:38.040]  What the fuck?
[21:38.240 --> 21:38.560]  You okay?
[21:38.920 --> 21:39.280]  Andrew!
[21:39.760 --> 21:40.240]  Andrew died.
[21:40.260 --> 21:41.160]  That's three for Andrew.
[21:41.160 --> 21:41.960]  Andrew died.
[21:42.560 --> 21:43.300]  That was me.
[21:43.360 --> 21:44.000]  Andrew, what happened?
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.080]  I didn't see him.
[21:47.180 --> 21:48.060]  I walked into a room.
[21:48.080 --> 21:48.580]  I didn't see him.
[21:48.660 --> 21:49.000]  He was hiding.
[21:50.460 --> 21:51.860]  Did you like the landing that time?
[21:52.480 --> 21:53.400]  It was a great landing.
[21:53.520 --> 21:53.680]  Okay.
[21:54.680 --> 21:55.320]  It looked clean.
[21:55.320 --> 21:56.120]  I'm not gonna die again.
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.560]  Unless Nick kills me.
[21:59.020 --> 21:59.940]  Declaring that right now.
[22:00.140 --> 22:00.480]  That's it.
[22:00.520 --> 22:01.340]  That was my last mistake.
[22:01.740 --> 22:01.920]  Okay.
[22:02.540 --> 22:04.300]  Why would it have to be on me to kill you?
[22:05.380 --> 22:06.800]  Well, it happened one time.
[22:06.880 --> 22:08.720]  So, I'm just covering my bases if I die.
[22:08.820 --> 22:09.360]  You know what?
[22:09.440 --> 22:09.760]  Fair point.
[22:09.760 --> 22:11.320]  What if Gavin kills you?
[22:13.800 --> 22:14.660]  That's assumed.
[22:15.560 --> 22:16.500]  I would never kill you.
[22:17.160 --> 22:18.820]  Unless there was a bounty truck.
[22:20.380 --> 22:23.980]  Me and Gavin have been team Tastin' Rockin' here.
[22:24.300 --> 22:27.300]  A series of coke is so fucking good for us.
[22:28.280 --> 22:28.820]  It is.
[22:29.760 --> 22:32.860]  Also think the boat is the much better vehicle to approach this.
[22:32.960 --> 22:33.520]  Agreed.
[22:33.660 --> 22:35.180]  I don't understand why.
[22:36.020 --> 22:39.680]  Why don't you guys dive out, land in our boat, and we'll go full on boat assault.
[22:39.880 --> 22:40.260]  Oh!
[22:40.680 --> 22:41.280]  I like that.
[22:41.280 --> 22:41.620]  You know what?
[22:41.980 --> 22:42.760]  I like that.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.740]  But you've gotta land on a moving boat.
[22:45.300 --> 22:45.520]  Yeah.
[22:46.120 --> 22:48.060]  Problem is you get there before we do.
[22:48.160 --> 22:48.840]  Why don't you stop?
[22:49.900 --> 22:50.300]  Okay.
[22:53.740 --> 22:55.640]  I see you going towards this yacht.
[22:55.780 --> 22:56.480]  Why aren't you stopping?
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.240]  Oh, guys.
[23:02.320 --> 23:03.280]  It might be on this one.
[23:03.360 --> 23:03.800]  Okay, hang on.
[23:05.180 --> 23:06.180]  Did you land up there?
[23:06.360 --> 23:06.700]  I did.
[23:07.260 --> 23:07.980]  That's great.
[23:08.160 --> 23:08.440]  Andrew!
[23:09.900 --> 23:10.680]  Hey, you know what?
[23:10.820 --> 23:11.220]  He's right.
[23:12.440 --> 23:12.840]  Fuck.
[23:13.200 --> 23:14.400]  Okay, that was... I'm not right.
[23:14.420 --> 23:15.020]  Oh my god, I'm so close to dying.
[23:15.020 --> 23:15.920]  That was way too early.
[23:16.540 --> 23:18.360]  I accidentally got on a jet ski instead of the boat.
[23:18.780 --> 23:19.580]  I'm gonna have to come in again.
[23:21.300 --> 23:21.760]  That's on...
[23:21.760 --> 23:22.420]  What?
[23:24.860 --> 23:25.260]  So...
[23:25.260 --> 23:26.160]  What's going on?
[23:27.240 --> 23:27.640]  So...
[23:29.040 --> 23:32.000]  This is the first mission in the heist.
[23:32.700 --> 23:36.560]  Yeah, we got five series of coke, series of bank, whatever.
[23:37.320 --> 23:38.580]  Series of bank.
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.780]  I don't...
[23:40.780 --> 23:41.440]  I couldn't remember the other ones.
[23:42.720 --> 23:43.460]  What happened?
[23:44.100 --> 23:45.800]  I followed Andrew's lead and...
[23:45.800 --> 23:46.020]  Andrew?
[23:46.280 --> 23:47.820]  Andrew's lead and I jumped out of the...
[23:47.820 --> 23:49.700]  Oh, it was Andrew's fault.
[23:50.460 --> 23:51.100]  Well, no.
[23:51.280 --> 23:54.940]  I jumped out, deployed the chute late, went straight into the water and died.
[23:56.780 --> 23:58.700]  Oh, I can't believe Andrew did that to you.
[23:59.660 --> 24:01.820]  No, he got... he jumped out first, so then I followed him.
[24:04.340 --> 24:06.160]  You guys wanna land on our boat?
[24:07.860 --> 24:08.700]  Uh, if you want.
[24:08.720 --> 24:10.060]  Yeah, if you're gonna wait for us, sure.
[24:10.380 --> 24:10.880]  Give it a go.
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.020]  You want us to land the chopper on your boat?
[24:14.520 --> 24:14.700]  No.
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.680]  We'll just jump out.
[24:17.620 --> 24:18.360]  Yeah, just jump out.
[24:19.760 --> 24:21.060]  I'm lined up on the boat.
[24:21.440 --> 24:21.600]  Yeah.
[24:23.840 --> 24:25.580]  Are you guys right past the dock or what?
[24:26.040 --> 24:26.300]  Yeah.
[24:26.300 --> 24:26.460]  Yeah.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.340]  You're gonna leave us, aren't you?
[24:29.860 --> 24:30.080]  Nope.
[24:30.400 --> 24:31.740]  No, we're trying to beat the mission.
[24:31.780 --> 24:32.340]  Oh, I see you.
[24:32.820 --> 24:33.440]  That's it.
[24:34.260 --> 24:35.460]  Alright, you ready, Andrew?
[24:36.000 --> 24:36.400]  Yep.
[24:37.540 --> 24:40.080]  Oh my god, you guys are going way past us.
[24:40.240 --> 24:42.180]  Where are you going, guys?
[24:42.740 --> 24:43.200]  Oh, here we go.
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.500]  They're coming back.
[24:44.500 --> 24:44.960]  Gavin, they're coming back.
[24:46.060 --> 24:47.020]  Coming back around, are ya?
[24:47.100 --> 24:47.300]  Yeah.
[24:48.780 --> 24:49.800]  Here they come.
[24:50.020 --> 24:52.040]  Wow, that's a significantly wide berth.
[24:54.160 --> 24:54.840]  Andrew's above.
[24:54.840 --> 24:56.560]  You might have to cut your chute and land.
[24:58.320 --> 24:59.360]  Oh, Nick missed.
[25:02.060 --> 25:03.260]  Alright, Nick's way back there.
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.480]  Go forward with the boat!
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  Forward with the boat!
[25:06.140 --> 25:07.120]  Forward with the boat!
[25:07.420 --> 25:07.900]  Going for Andrew!
[25:07.900 --> 25:08.560]  You can catch me!
[25:08.740 --> 25:09.880]  Going for Andrew!
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.320]  You can catch me!
[25:11.540 --> 25:12.380]  Catching Andrew!
[25:12.700 --> 25:13.600]  Catch me!
[25:14.140 --> 25:15.000]  Catch Andrew!
[25:15.220 --> 25:16.480]  Put me in your arms!
[25:25.520 --> 25:28.100]  I don't think we're getting criminal masterminds.
[25:34.500 --> 25:36.600]  I may have rigged the boat before we set off.
[25:37.040 --> 25:37.400]  No!
[25:38.100 --> 25:40.940]  Yeah, we've been doing that. It's been really working for us.
[25:41.700 --> 25:42.240]  Oh yeah?
[25:42.640 --> 25:43.540]  Yeah, it's been pretty cool.
[25:44.040 --> 25:45.980]  I mean, I haven't been dying. I've been doing great.
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.700]  I get in there, I have like a plan of attack, I feel good about it.
[25:50.520 --> 25:52.940]  How many videos do you think this heist alone is gonna be?
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.940]  Why don't we do this? Why don't we do this?
[25:55.040 --> 25:56.420]  Eric, you bomb the boat.
[25:57.580 --> 25:57.940]  Why?
[25:57.940 --> 26:03.740]  And then, well because if there's no friendly fire, I can keep driving the boat, and then you can blow it up.
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.820]  You're gonna blow up, you're gonna die when the boat explodes.
[26:07.340 --> 26:08.540]  But there's no friendly fire.
[26:08.940 --> 26:11.000]  The boat is going to kill you when it explodes.
[26:11.880 --> 26:13.020]  I don't know if that's right.
[26:13.200 --> 26:14.060]  I do and it is!
[26:14.060 --> 26:16.480]  The bomb will kill you, but the boat will kill you. He is correct.
[26:17.060 --> 26:17.520]  You will die.
[26:17.520 --> 26:17.740]  Who's correct?
[26:18.480 --> 26:18.840]  Eric!
[26:19.400 --> 26:20.740]  I don't think we know that for sure.
[26:22.480 --> 26:23.200]  So stupid.
[26:23.200 --> 26:25.500]  Hey guys, the night sky is beautiful.
[26:26.620 --> 26:28.620]  Let's test it, let's test it right now. Look at this, look at this.
[26:28.780 --> 26:30.700]  Alright, do you die if I do this?
[26:30.880 --> 26:31.120]  Okay.
[26:32.180 --> 26:32.580]  Go.
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.240]  Okay, I'm going.
[26:35.480 --> 26:36.540]  Alright, whenever you're ready.
[26:37.520 --> 26:37.640]  Oh!
[26:39.200 --> 26:40.300]  Oh, you didn't die.
[26:40.320 --> 26:40.820]  Andrew died.
[26:42.820 --> 26:43.220]  Andrew!
[26:45.500 --> 26:45.900]  Andrew?
[26:46.060 --> 26:46.320]  Andrew?
[26:46.840 --> 26:47.940]  What happened?
[26:48.600 --> 26:52.380]  I thought you were going to die and I was trying to dive into your boat, but I got excited.
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.620]  I jumped way too early and Nick was low and I hit the sand. I just died in the sand.
[26:57.780 --> 27:00.240]  I was low because I was going to do a swoop check on them.
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.100]  That's not a thing.
[27:02.680 --> 27:05.080]  Yeah, you should do it. You should do a swoop check.
[27:05.420 --> 27:05.780]  Okay.
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.640]  I didn't get off the beach.
[27:10.360 --> 27:11.620]  Alright, we'll swoop into you guys.
[27:11.880 --> 27:16.220]  Gavin, load up the boat with explosives. I'll drive the boat and then you blow it up when you feel ready.
[27:17.020 --> 27:18.900]  Okay, I'm going to put five bombs on it.
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.660]  That's way too many, but okay.
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.600]  Well, it didn't blow up, but I did one.
[27:23.560 --> 27:24.980]  Right, but it didn't kill me.
[27:26.220 --> 27:27.440]  Right, because of friendly fire.
[27:28.480 --> 27:29.920]  Right, but the boat didn't blow up.
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.250]  Yeah, but if the boat...
[27:32.020 --> 27:34.620]  Go ahead and blow as many as you want, dude. Go for it.
[27:36.000 --> 27:36.300]  One.
[27:36.380 --> 27:38.480]  Nick, land on the top of the yacht, not the helipad.
[27:38.500 --> 27:38.760]  Three.
[27:40.040 --> 27:40.340]  Four.
[27:40.860 --> 27:42.120]  Yeah, I was just going on top.
[27:43.500 --> 27:44.940]  Alright, we'll give it a shot.
[27:45.000 --> 27:45.640]  We've got a disco boat. Look at this.
[27:45.640 --> 27:46.880]  We do have a disco boat.
[27:49.800 --> 27:50.600]  Are you ready?
[27:51.380 --> 27:51.640]  Yep.
[27:51.680 --> 27:52.440]  I'm going to take it all the way in.
[27:54.100 --> 27:55.060]  Okay, I'm jumping now.
[27:56.900 --> 27:57.380]  Now!
[27:57.700 --> 27:58.020]  Oh no!
[27:58.540 --> 27:59.440]  I landed!
[28:02.180 --> 28:06.100]  Alright, the very top. The very top. The very top. The very top. The very top. The very top.
[28:08.200 --> 28:10.580]  This is working! This is working!
[28:10.580 --> 28:10.900]  This is working!
[28:15.160 --> 28:17.420]  Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
[28:18.480 --> 28:19.680]  B, play safely.
[28:22.220 --> 28:23.600]  Oh, I shot that woman!
[28:27.990 --> 28:28.430]  Sorry.
[28:28.770 --> 28:31.690]  I put so many bullets in this. Fucking die!
[28:32.250 --> 28:32.670]  There we go.
[28:32.870 --> 28:34.230]  Okay, got some coke.
[28:37.030 --> 28:37.970]  Got some more.
[28:40.330 --> 28:42.270]  Making my way up now.
[28:42.930 --> 28:43.750]  Andrew, careful.
[28:44.370 --> 28:44.770]  Yeah.
[28:45.390 --> 28:46.290]  Oh, we got one at level.
[28:47.070 --> 28:47.610]  Yeah, we do.
[28:49.090 --> 28:50.030]  Careful of helicopters.
[28:50.890 --> 28:51.190]  I got it.
[28:53.890 --> 28:55.130]  That's for you, sir.
[28:55.230 --> 28:55.510]  Whoa!
[28:55.710 --> 28:56.590]  Oh, they lived!
[28:56.990 --> 28:57.690]  I'm getting lit up!
[28:59.770 --> 29:00.810]  Have a nice evening.
[29:03.510 --> 29:05.410]  Oh, there's a coke right over here.
[29:05.650 --> 29:06.410]  Okay, they're dead.
[29:07.210 --> 29:07.950]  Okay, we got the coke.
[29:08.450 --> 29:09.230]  Series of coke.
[29:09.270 --> 29:10.230]  Top of the boat is secure.
[29:10.230 --> 29:11.770]  I got it. I got it. I got coke.
[29:12.810 --> 29:13.190]  Motherfucker!
[29:15.090 --> 29:17.150]  Keep making it happen, boys. You got it.
[29:20.550 --> 29:20.970]  Stop!
[29:21.490 --> 29:21.770]  Whoa!
[29:25.250 --> 29:26.790]  I'll just manually do it.
[29:26.950 --> 29:27.490]  Hey, hey, hey!
[29:28.790 --> 29:30.810]  I almost shot you.
[29:31.210 --> 29:32.330]  Got it. Let's keep going.
[29:33.090 --> 29:34.090]  Gavin, Gavin, watch your health.
[29:35.230 --> 29:35.870]  Watching it.
[29:36.130 --> 29:36.250]  Okay.
[29:39.800 --> 29:41.420]  Keep moving, keep moving. Doing good.
[29:41.540 --> 29:42.400]  Oh, oh, coke back here.
[29:44.460 --> 29:46.460]  Okay, getting the next one.
[29:51.460 --> 29:53.420]  I think we're getting the last thing of coke right now.
[29:53.620 --> 29:54.020]  Yep, yep.
[29:55.400 --> 29:57.360]  Okay, let's get our jet skis.
[29:58.320 --> 29:59.820]  Oh, how appropriate.
[29:59.980 --> 30:00.320]  Oh, the chopper.
[30:01.060 --> 30:01.580]  Is there a chopper?
[30:01.580 --> 30:01.760]  Chopper's dead.
[30:02.120 --> 30:02.520]  Well...
[30:02.520 --> 30:03.820]  Well, they had one.
[30:04.100 --> 30:06.620]  Okay, so I'm asking, is there a chopper?
[30:07.220 --> 30:08.320]  No, it's dead.
[30:08.440 --> 30:08.660]  Okay.
[30:09.520 --> 30:10.700]  It's got no rotors.
[30:12.700 --> 30:14.620]  We landed a little too close to the mast.
[30:15.060 --> 30:16.660]  Hang on, I'm coming to the back, I'm coming to the back.
[30:16.660 --> 30:17.280]  I'm coming back to the sea.
[30:17.380 --> 30:18.500]  Don't leave without me, please.
[30:22.490 --> 30:23.450]  Have you nicked our boat?
[30:24.630 --> 30:26.270]  No, I'm in a jet ski.
[30:27.130 --> 30:27.450]  Geronies!
[30:29.290 --> 30:30.830]  Where the hell is this chopper?
[30:31.090 --> 30:31.810]  Oh, there it is.
[30:33.130 --> 30:34.550]  Me and you, Andrew, let's do it.
[30:35.270 --> 30:35.730]  Get on it.
[30:37.850 --> 30:38.610]  I got it.
[30:38.970 --> 30:42.610]  I think you got to get to land, and then we got to get out of here, dude.
[30:43.690 --> 30:44.290]  You think land?
[30:44.670 --> 30:47.410]  Yeah, well, it says we have to go to a warehouse. Where's the warehouse?
[30:48.130 --> 30:49.470]  I have to lose the cops.
[30:50.070 --> 30:53.190]  Yeah, I know, but if they're in helicopters, we're not going to lose them, right?
[30:53.790 --> 30:54.310]  I shot them.
[30:54.310 --> 30:54.630]  Yeah, we can.
[30:56.990 --> 30:58.190]  I'm about to be under the rain.
[30:58.250 --> 30:58.530]  No!
[31:00.230 --> 31:00.550]  What?
[31:00.630 --> 31:01.450]  It's okay, we're okay.
[31:03.050 --> 31:03.810]  Yep, I'm under rain.
[31:04.210 --> 31:06.110]  No, no, they're coming right ahead of you! Turn!
[31:06.890 --> 31:07.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[31:08.250 --> 31:11.250]  You're good, Andrew. Oh, Andrew, you're killing it right now. You're doing so good.
[31:11.410 --> 31:12.910]  You're fucking crushing it, Andrew.
[31:13.610 --> 31:14.430]  It's fine, we're fine.
[31:15.450 --> 31:16.250]  We're going to go up?
[31:16.250 --> 31:18.950]  Yeah, dude. Oh, Andrew, you're killing it. Killing it.
[31:19.010 --> 31:20.590]  I just got to get to my jet ski.
[31:21.270 --> 31:21.990]  Good work.
[31:22.430 --> 31:23.250]  There's no problem.
[31:23.430 --> 31:25.290]  Andrew, you're doing fucking great.
[31:27.790 --> 31:28.510]  They're coming up.
[31:28.850 --> 31:30.230]  Oh, no, no, right ahead. Dead ahead!
[31:30.850 --> 31:31.210]  Shit.
[31:31.210 --> 31:32.210]  Make a move! Make a move!
[31:34.390 --> 31:35.310]  Fuck. Okay.
[31:38.490 --> 31:42.470]  That's fine. We'll lose them again because there's nothing. Oh, well, there was nothing over here.
[31:43.790 --> 31:44.710]  I'm just going to go out to sea.
[31:44.710 --> 31:46.430]  I think that might be too...
[31:46.430 --> 31:46.970]  Okay.
[31:48.710 --> 31:49.030]  Whoa.
[31:50.590 --> 31:52.990]  Oh, hang right. Right or left? Right or left? Right or left?
[31:54.430 --> 31:55.210]  Gavin, where are you?
[31:55.810 --> 31:56.850]  I'm just following them.
[31:58.030 --> 32:00.490]  Well, watch out. The cop's right there, man. They're going to get you.
[32:01.350 --> 32:01.610]  Nah.
[32:05.280 --> 32:06.500]  Further out to sea.
[32:08.380 --> 32:09.300]  Oh, there you go.
[32:09.340 --> 32:10.300]  Another one on the right.
[32:10.400 --> 32:11.520]  Hang that left. Hang that left.
[32:11.680 --> 32:11.940]  There you go.
[32:12.020 --> 32:12.520]  Oh, oh, oh.
[32:12.820 --> 32:15.220]  Little right. Little right. You're all right. You're good. You're good.
[32:16.480 --> 32:17.500]  Okay, now right.
[32:17.580 --> 32:19.300]  Yep, there's one to the left now, so go right.
[32:19.420 --> 32:19.680]  Yeah, you're good. You're good.
[32:21.800 --> 32:22.460]  What happened?
[32:23.420 --> 32:26.220]  Oh, shit. My camera got so fucking wacky we were underwater.
[32:26.540 --> 32:26.700]  Oh!
[32:28.340 --> 32:28.700]  Warehouse time.
[32:28.700 --> 32:30.340]  We got it. We got it. We got it. All right, turn around.
[32:30.340 --> 32:30.980]  We're going to the warehouse.
[32:31.100 --> 32:31.460]  Oh!
[32:36.210 --> 32:37.730]  The 5-0's all over me.
[32:37.910 --> 32:39.070]  Let's group up. Let's group up.
[32:39.390 --> 32:40.970]  We lost the cops.
[32:41.690 --> 32:42.510]  I haven't yet.
[32:43.090 --> 32:44.650]  Nick, lose the cops and then beat us up.
[32:46.130 --> 32:48.510]  The warehouse is so far away.
[32:49.250 --> 32:51.410]  Oh, my God! No! The chopper!
[32:52.490 --> 32:53.550]  Nick, get out of there, son.
[32:53.630 --> 32:55.010]  It swung around and saw me.
[32:55.230 --> 32:56.510]  Nick, just keep doing your thing, man.
[32:57.810 --> 32:58.610]  I'm going to die.
[33:00.730 --> 33:01.710]  Ah, fuck it. I'll just get in the car.
[33:01.750 --> 33:03.910]  I think, can we take the water all the way there, Andrew?
[33:05.230 --> 33:05.750]  We can.
[33:06.190 --> 33:06.470]  Can we?
[33:06.550 --> 33:11.770]  If you go, like, check it out. Go south. You can go around. You can take...
[33:11.770 --> 33:14.690]  Is that river going to have water in it, though?
[33:15.130 --> 33:15.810]  Yeah, maybe it is.
[33:15.930 --> 33:16.110]  Try it.
[33:17.690 --> 33:18.450]  Nah, try it.
[33:19.990 --> 33:21.290]  I think it's better just to go to land.
[33:22.070 --> 33:23.410]  Gavin's right. Try it.
[33:23.610 --> 33:24.050]  I'm going to beat you.
[33:27.550 --> 33:28.810]  Hey, did you lose the cops yet, Nick?
[33:29.590 --> 33:29.910]  Almost.
[33:33.250 --> 33:35.570]  Where's the warehouse in relation to the beach?
[33:35.630 --> 33:36.670]  It's in East Vinewood.
[33:36.670 --> 33:43.750]  It's northeast of the ammunition range that's, like, in Pillbox.
[33:46.330 --> 33:46.730]  Ow.
[33:46.910 --> 33:49.250]  It's, like, on the northeast part of the city.
[33:55.710 --> 33:56.990]  That was pretty epic.
[33:57.450 --> 33:58.190]  That was awesome.
[33:59.470 --> 33:59.870]  Yes!
[34:00.470 --> 34:01.210]  You lose them?
[34:01.990 --> 34:02.250]  Yeah.
[34:03.170 --> 34:03.670]  Good job.
[34:04.050 --> 34:04.390]  Here we go.
[34:06.810 --> 34:07.790]  Hop in, boys.
[34:10.590 --> 34:11.370]  Let's pick up Nick.
[34:12.390 --> 34:13.070]  Where is he?
[34:15.150 --> 34:16.110]  He's still in the sea.
[34:16.530 --> 34:17.630]  No, I'm not allowed to see anyone.
[34:17.810 --> 34:18.170]  He's down the road.
[34:18.270 --> 34:19.190]  Oh, my God. He's so far.
[34:19.370 --> 34:20.430]  Okay, I'll pick him up.
[34:21.870 --> 34:22.690]  What are you guys in?
[34:23.710 --> 34:24.510]  We're in a little Ford.
[34:24.510 --> 34:24.990]  Pretty cool.
[34:25.930 --> 34:27.750]  Yeah, pretty cool Ford.
[34:28.270 --> 34:29.330]  In awesome Kia.
[34:32.890 --> 34:33.810]  I'm coming to you, though.
[34:34.650 --> 34:36.330]  Okay, well, I'm heading your way, too.
[34:37.310 --> 34:38.190]  Oh, hit that bike.
[34:38.570 --> 34:39.510]  Not gonna hit the bike.
[34:40.150 --> 34:40.770]  Hit the bike.
[34:41.150 --> 34:41.970]  Oh, let's take the bus.
[34:42.750 --> 34:43.730]  Oh, my God.
[34:44.530 --> 34:44.770]  Yeah.
[34:45.510 --> 34:46.490]  Let's help the environment.
[34:46.870 --> 34:47.990]  We'll deliver Coke in style.
[34:48.590 --> 34:49.590]  Stealing a bus.
[34:50.670 --> 34:51.570]  See us coming, Nick?
[34:52.230 --> 34:52.670]  Yeah.
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.400]  Oh!
[35:10.600 --> 35:11.480]  All right, here we go, boys.
[35:12.420 --> 35:13.020]  Where's Andrew?
[35:14.360 --> 35:15.240]  He's in the car with us.
[35:15.260 --> 35:15.600]  I'm in the car.
[35:16.600 --> 35:17.220]  Hop in, guys.
[35:18.180 --> 35:18.440]  Oh!
[35:19.720 --> 35:20.520]  Coke bus.
[35:22.140 --> 35:23.120]  There's a Coke bus.
[35:25.500 --> 35:26.780]  Everybody on the bus.
[35:27.280 --> 35:28.560]  No, get on the bus.
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.280]  50 cents, please.
[35:30.520 --> 35:30.960]  50.
[35:32.060 --> 35:32.540]  Coke bus.
[35:33.520 --> 35:34.400]  All right.
[35:34.980 --> 35:35.520]  All right.
[35:36.740 --> 35:37.180]  Inconspicuous.
[35:37.340 --> 35:38.180]  Welcome to Coke bus.
[35:38.340 --> 35:39.700]  We're gonna go first person in Coke bus.
[35:41.060 --> 35:41.840]  Oh, my God.
[35:43.620 --> 35:46.020]  If the guy was still on that, he'd be very upset.
[35:46.140 --> 35:47.500]  Dude, first person in Coke bus rocks.
[35:48.440 --> 35:49.100]  He liking it?
[35:49.380 --> 35:49.680]  Oh, wow.
[35:50.440 --> 35:50.560]  Yeah.
[35:53.580 --> 35:54.160]  Uh-oh.
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.040]  I'm gonna stare out longingly at the sea.
[36:00.200 --> 36:01.640]  Oh, there's a bunch of buildings, so never mind.
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.100]  Guys, this bus can't go below 50.
[36:04.440 --> 36:04.760]  No!
[36:05.060 --> 36:06.260]  This is the wrong bus.
[36:08.700 --> 36:10.060]  Well, it's the speed bus.
[36:10.260 --> 36:11.500]  It's just a different kind of speed.
[36:14.580 --> 36:15.540]  Wait, do the Coke.
[36:20.790 --> 36:24.650]  Well, we really figured out that that yacht thing took a few attempts.
[36:24.950 --> 36:25.030]  Yeah.
[36:25.130 --> 36:29.630]  Some of us maybe died a few more times than others, but I don't think I died once.
[36:30.410 --> 36:31.370]  No, you did great.
[36:31.690 --> 36:35.150]  And from someone diving out of an airborne boat, that's pretty impressive.
[36:35.170 --> 36:35.850]  Yeah, it was pretty sick.
[36:36.050 --> 36:37.370]  It was pretty fucking sick.
[36:39.590 --> 36:43.530]  Did you have to hit Y and then jump out physically or did it let you out automatically?
[36:43.710 --> 36:47.910]  Yeah, it was like you hit Y and it would like stand you up, walk towards like the back of the boat,
[36:47.910 --> 36:51.670]  and then it would like release you, and by then the boat was kind of like in the air,
[36:51.850 --> 36:54.310]  and you would just end up somewhere, and I would land on the boat.
[36:54.390 --> 36:54.890]  It was sick.
[36:55.630 --> 36:56.350]  That's awesome.
[36:56.910 --> 36:57.490]  This is great.
[36:57.630 --> 36:57.890]  The Coke.
[36:58.330 --> 36:58.870]  Here's the thing.
[36:58.990 --> 37:02.350]  Coke bus is great just to kind of reminisce and think about.
[37:02.550 --> 37:03.010]  It's serene.
[37:03.190 --> 37:04.370]  We can talk about a mission.
[37:04.590 --> 37:04.990]  This is nice.
[37:05.550 --> 37:12.490]  This is just like when you go to 6th Street and then you come back with all your buds and catch up at the end of the night on the bus to West Campus.
[37:14.170 --> 37:15.010]  You fingered who?
[37:18.770 --> 37:22.370]  I was just going to say we went to the dueling piano bar, but all right.
[37:22.390 --> 37:23.510]  Yeah, their first album.
[37:24.310 --> 37:26.050]  Johnny had an adventure that night.
[37:27.030 --> 37:28.350]  We're almost there.
[37:29.030 --> 37:30.390]  A few more wacky turns.
[37:30.890 --> 37:32.140]  A few more wacky turns.
[37:33.490 --> 37:34.570]  Everyone ready to dive?
[37:34.910 --> 37:35.130]  Yep.
[37:42.270 --> 37:44.610]  Can we get down there like a shortcut?
[37:45.230 --> 37:45.850]  Oh my God.
[37:48.230 --> 37:48.730]  No.
[37:48.930 --> 37:50.370]  What are you doing, Gavin?
[37:50.370 --> 37:50.930]  Come on.
[37:50.930 --> 37:52.090]  That's just not going to work.
[37:52.270 --> 37:53.370]  Gavin, this is...
[37:54.650 --> 37:55.510]  All right, everyone out.
[37:55.510 --> 37:56.090]  This is not going to work.
[37:56.450 --> 37:57.250]  Everyone out.
[38:01.550 --> 38:02.470]  You're going to die.
[38:04.250 --> 38:05.030]  No, you don't die from that.
[38:05.030 --> 38:05.870]  Oh, is it that far?
[38:06.010 --> 38:06.930]  Oh, don't do that.
[38:07.370 --> 38:08.050]  Oh, hell no.
[38:09.590 --> 38:09.990]  Nick.
[38:10.150 --> 38:10.550]  Nick.
[38:11.550 --> 38:11.950]  Nick.
[38:12.730 --> 38:13.550]  No, Eric.
[38:13.810 --> 38:14.930]  You're the driver.
[38:15.590 --> 38:16.290]  Pedestrians on the right way.
[38:16.290 --> 38:18.330]  Right, and you're the guy running in the way.
[38:19.030 --> 38:19.590]  No.
[38:20.490 --> 38:21.790]  You're driving in the way.
[38:24.870 --> 38:25.970]  No, you're insane.
[38:26.150 --> 38:26.370]  No.
[38:26.750 --> 38:27.550]  Oh, yeah, officer.
[38:27.730 --> 38:29.350]  I didn't mean to run that person over.
[38:32.470 --> 38:34.470]  I walked over there.
[38:36.970 --> 38:38.730]  Oh, get over here, Eric.
[38:39.550 --> 38:40.490]  Last to Team Tate.
[38:42.510 --> 38:43.070]  Awesome.
[38:45.750 --> 38:47.150]  It's cocaine, dipshit.
[38:49.590 --> 38:51.230]  You sent us here to do this.
[38:55.460 --> 38:55.900]  What?
[39:13.980 --> 39:15.340]  Way to go, Team Tate.
[39:16.900 --> 39:17.740]  Way to go.
[39:17.840 --> 39:18.460]  No bad ideas.
[39:18.460 --> 39:19.300]  No bad ideas.
[39:19.460 --> 39:20.180]  Carrying us again.
[39:24.540 --> 39:25.980]  That man is having a coke day.
[39:26.180 --> 39:27.360]  Oh, my setup passed.
[39:27.500 --> 39:27.900]  We did it.
[39:28.840 --> 39:29.760]  Who's all the way at the top?
[39:31.520 --> 39:32.240]  Eric Badour.
[39:32.640 --> 39:33.000]  Wow.
[39:33.740 --> 39:34.820]  I don't know why I got bronze.
[39:35.340 --> 39:36.020]  Yeah, that's kind of bullshit.
[39:38.900 --> 39:39.900]  Wow, I went up there.
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.600]  Well, this is the first setup of another heist.
[39:41.620 --> 39:42.640]  Oh, my God, we did it.
[39:42.700 --> 39:44.580]  Thank you so much for watching.
[39:45.400 --> 39:46.760]  We got plenty more videos to come.
[39:47.840 --> 39:49.620]  It's all in charred territory for me.
[39:49.760 --> 39:50.200]  Yeah, me too.
[39:50.380 --> 39:50.700]  I'm enjoying this.
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.260]  And Gavin because he doesn't remember.
[39:52.380 --> 39:52.920]  It's pretty exciting.
[39:52.920 --> 39:53.480]  Right.
[39:54.480 --> 40:00.960]  But our guarantee is that Geoff will not be in town when these heists happen, guys.
[40:01.060 --> 40:02.240]  That's a promise to you.
[40:02.540 --> 40:03.540]  Look at this crew.
[40:04.220 --> 40:04.920]  Look at this.
[40:04.920 --> 40:05.520]  Oh, what a crew.
[40:05.520 --> 40:07.020]  Bunch of scumbags.
[40:07.160 --> 40:07.320]  What?
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.180]  Look at this.
[40:08.260 --> 40:09.540]  Look at this crew right here, baby.
[40:09.980 --> 40:10.840]  Look at this crew.
[40:15.340 --> 40:16.260]  Immediately dead.
[40:16.260 --> 40:16.760]  Thank you so much.
[40:16.840 --> 40:19.440]  Check out our Patreon, the Regulation Pod.
[40:19.640 --> 40:20.240]  We got a podcast.
[40:20.600 --> 40:21.360]  We got all sorts of stuff.
[40:21.360 --> 40:22.820]  Regulatrion.com.
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.180]  And we'll be back soon.
[40:24.620 --> 40:24.900]  Whoa!
[40:25.500 --> 40:25.860]  Bye!
[40:26.160 --> 40:26.560]  Bye!
[40:26.840 --> 40:27.240]  Bye!
[40:27.660 --> 40:28.100]  Ah!
[40:28.680 --> 40:29.120]  Wait.
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.180]  Ratt, stay there.
[40:30.340 --> 40:30.820]  Stay there, Ratt.
[40:30.860 --> 40:31.100]  Okay, okay.
[40:32.000 --> 40:32.940]  Stay by the railing.
[40:33.100 --> 40:33.740]  You got it.
[40:34.740 --> 40:35.420]  Not moving.
[40:35.680 --> 40:36.240]  I'm dancing for you.
[40:36.240 --> 40:37.520]  No, that was my own car!
[40:37.720 --> 40:38.820]  I'm dancing in the dark, baby.
[40:40.340 --> 40:41.080]  You wish.
[40:41.340 --> 40:42.400]  You fucking wish, Gavin.
[40:42.640 --> 40:42.840]  Oh, shit.
[40:44.900 --> 40:45.720]  Oh, shit.
[40:46.040 --> 40:46.580]  You wish.
[40:50.300 --> 40:51.240]  Oh, shit.
[40:51.320 --> 40:52.340]  It really slowed me down.
[40:53.840 --> 40:54.480]  Ah!
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.140]  Oh!
[40:57.700 --> 40:59.720]  Oh, you keep getting saved.
[41:01.920 --> 41:03.000]  Oh!
[41:10.960 --> 41:11.600]  Bye!
