[00:00.000 --> 00:02.180]  All right, Andrew, you want to kick it off?
[00:02.300 --> 00:04.660]  This was your idea, and I know you're excited to do it.
[00:05.280 --> 00:05.960]  We're Predators.
[00:06.380 --> 00:08.240]  It's a regular gameplay of Predators.
[00:08.640 --> 00:10.760]  I am going to become a Predator.
[00:11.040 --> 00:13.820]  What? You're going to what?
[00:13.820 --> 00:14.720]  I'm going to become a Predator.
[00:15.740 --> 00:17.080]  It's got to stop saying that.
[00:17.100 --> 00:17.780]  No, you know, the Predator.
[00:18.600 --> 00:20.740]  Is it called Predators or Preda? Predator.
[00:22.260 --> 00:25.120]  OK, well, there's a movie called Predators with,
[00:25.820 --> 00:27.860]  I think that's the Adrian Brody one.
[00:28.260 --> 00:28.780]  Yeah, I don't think.
[00:28.920 --> 00:29.360]  Yeah, no, I mean,
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.640]  I don't think you have to explain the movies when I'm playing the game.
[00:32.840 --> 00:34.320]  Could you explain that movie to me?
[00:34.360 --> 00:37.500]  OK, so Adrian Brody is a soldier
[00:37.500 --> 00:40.260]  and he wakes up falling from the sky.
[00:41.020 --> 00:41.880]  Ready up, Schmucks.
[00:42.140 --> 00:44.460]  I'm going to Mutant Defen since I am the Predator.
[00:44.580 --> 00:47.740]  OK, that is sort of the thing we do because this is a 4v1 game.
[00:48.180 --> 00:50.100]  So whoever is the Predator,
[00:52.000 --> 00:52.780]  Mutant Defens.
[00:53.860 --> 00:55.280]  OK, OK. Nice.
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.700]  Geoff, you've played the tutorial or something, have you?
[00:58.700 --> 01:01.020]  I did play the tutorial like three weeks ago.
[01:01.060 --> 01:02.280]  So what tips do you have for us?
[01:02.620 --> 01:04.480]  Zero. You got no tip.
[01:04.920 --> 01:06.940]  I think I think right triggers fire.
[01:07.820 --> 01:10.160]  Yeah. OK, well, that's yeah.
[01:10.500 --> 01:12.220]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:13.220 --> 01:15.720]  Why is Gavin? Gavin, why are you the Predator?
[01:15.860 --> 01:16.660]  Gavin is the Predator.
[01:16.760 --> 01:18.780]  Wait what? They ignored my preference!
[01:19.300 --> 01:20.820]  You idiot. You idiot.
[01:21.100 --> 01:22.340]  I don't know how to be the Predator.
[01:22.440 --> 01:24.280]  Mutant Defen, Mutant Defen, Gavin.
[01:25.220 --> 01:26.780]  Hold on, let me switch input.
[01:26.780 --> 01:27.820]  God damn it.
[01:27.900 --> 01:28.920]  Son of a bitch.
[01:29.340 --> 01:30.340]  I'm going to be the shittiest Predator.
[01:30.420 --> 01:31.080]  OK, bye, guys.
[01:31.220 --> 01:31.700]  I'll see you later.
[01:31.900 --> 01:32.100]  Bye, buddy.
[01:36.700 --> 01:37.640]  Who's a moron?
[01:38.880 --> 01:39.800]  Him, not you.
[01:40.120 --> 01:40.860]  I just want to make sure.
[01:41.140 --> 01:42.840]  How the fuck do I get into the... Oh.
[01:43.700 --> 01:44.140]  It's going.
[01:44.240 --> 01:46.700]  Did he pick? Did he pick Predator at the last second?
[01:46.880 --> 01:47.580]  No, he picked.
[01:47.680 --> 01:49.240]  He didn't pick one thing or the other.
[01:49.520 --> 01:50.460]  He just said random.
[01:51.460 --> 01:52.260]  Yeah, turd.
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.680]  Oh, headquarters.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.000]  I'm a snack.
[01:57.160 --> 01:58.100]  Oh, look at me.
[01:59.840 --> 02:03.060]  Was the Predator always just a ripped man from the neck down?
[02:04.040 --> 02:06.760]  He was too busy asking you for tips or whatever.
[02:07.080 --> 02:09.300]  I just really wanted to know the plot of the film Predators,
[02:09.360 --> 02:10.620]  which stars Walton Goggins.
[02:10.740 --> 02:11.500]  He's an inmate.
[02:12.360 --> 02:13.380]  Oh, well, it is.
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.780]  The the plot of Predators is just a baby's first movie.
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.520]  It's like, well, what if Predator went after the most dangerous game?
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.340]  One is a samurai and one is a gunslinger.
[02:26.460 --> 02:27.960]  So Walton Goggins was a samurai?
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.280]  Uh, he was an inmate.
[02:30.420 --> 02:31.680]  That was really good at stabbing.
[02:31.860 --> 02:34.280]  Yeah. Yeah, he was a stabby, stabby boy.
[02:35.140 --> 02:36.620]  All right. Jump. Oh, I can jump high.
[02:39.460 --> 02:41.840]  OK, I've got throw.
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.000]  Oh, some vision.
[02:46.260 --> 02:48.860]  Very nice. And invisibility, I assume.
[02:50.520 --> 02:51.300]  Hell yeah.
[02:53.620 --> 02:55.060]  Where are these schmucks at?
[02:57.260 --> 02:58.060]  Preddy's hungry.
[02:59.960 --> 03:02.120]  All right, now there's there's dudes together.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.740]  There's AI we got to kill.
[03:04.040 --> 03:05.840]  All right. We have to complete little missions.
[03:06.340 --> 03:08.960]  OK, it'll be like collect the data or whatever.
[03:09.420 --> 03:12.240]  A lot of it can be done stealth, but you really just kind of run through
[03:12.240 --> 03:13.560]  and kill the dumb ass AI.
[03:13.820 --> 03:17.740]  And then at some point, Predator shows up and he tries to fuck us up.
[03:17.740 --> 03:22.320]  But if we complete all the missions, we can escape like helicopter.
[03:22.320 --> 03:23.260]  Get the fuck out of here.
[03:23.420 --> 03:26.480]  Let's let's stick together to the. Yeah.
[03:27.280 --> 03:30.600]  Geoff, classically the leader of the podcast and the video game.
[03:30.840 --> 03:31.660]  Most disposable.
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.900]  And if I I'm putting myself out there first, because if I go down,
[03:36.280 --> 03:38.260]  you guys have the best shot of survival without me.
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.520]  All right. Right behind you, Cap.
[03:41.580 --> 03:45.060]  All right. I just need to find everyone who isn't Andrew.
[03:45.060 --> 03:48.720]  I'm sure I can eat Geoff almost instantly.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.920]  Ah. Is there stuff to like?
[03:55.240 --> 03:57.040]  Oh, there. Yeah. Oh, there's a riverboat.
[03:57.540 --> 03:59.760]  How do you can like, is there like a way to climb?
[04:00.080 --> 04:01.440]  Or I guess you just have to jump in.
[04:01.920 --> 04:03.520]  That's a doesn't.
[04:03.760 --> 04:04.980]  A is like mental jump.
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.780]  What is this? Oh, I got veritanium.
[04:11.820 --> 04:14.800]  I think you use that as like a currency to buy shit or sweet.
[04:15.060 --> 04:17.700]  Seems like it. I mean, we'll see.
[04:17.820 --> 04:20.520]  Am I Wolverine now? Really? Yeah. OK.
[04:20.640 --> 04:22.160]  Yeah. That's what Wolverine is.
[04:22.260 --> 04:24.680]  He's a guy who collects veritanium. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:24.920 --> 04:26.380]  That's what his bones are made of. Right.
[04:27.940 --> 04:29.480]  Veritanium. Can I kill Nick?
[04:30.020 --> 04:31.480]  I would like it. I don't know.
[04:31.580 --> 04:34.120]  Friendly fire is on, but you can. Oh, let's find out.
[04:36.300 --> 04:37.660]  It's not friendly fires off.
[04:37.700 --> 04:38.920]  OK, let's turn it on the next game.
[04:48.770 --> 04:50.250]  Did I kill someone?
[04:50.870 --> 04:52.490]  Or is that A.I.?
[04:54.250 --> 04:55.790]  I don't know if these are real people.
[05:01.110 --> 05:01.970]  Predator Hospital.
[05:03.810 --> 05:05.310]  Let me suck this blood bag.
[05:09.800 --> 05:10.680]  Oh, shit.
[05:12.140 --> 05:15.200]  Let's do the let's do the mission where we have to plant the communications
[05:15.200 --> 05:16.640]  devices or whatever one down.
[05:16.860 --> 05:19.800]  Oh, and at some point, Gavin's going to figure out how to play.
[05:20.060 --> 05:21.480]  He got incoming already.
[05:21.480 --> 05:24.300]  He's not, which leads you to believe.
[05:24.440 --> 05:25.620]  Well, I feel like I heard him.
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.980]  I heard some like weird noises. OK.
[05:28.320 --> 05:29.800]  Oh, it's Predator! It's Predator!
[05:30.060 --> 05:31.900]  Wait, where? Where? It's Predator!
[05:33.020 --> 05:35.080]  On me! Oh no! Eric!
[05:36.740 --> 05:38.460]  Call for help. I got Predator'd.
[05:38.480 --> 05:40.240]  Are you alive? Oh, you are. Yes.
[05:40.400 --> 05:42.680]  I'm I'm climbing. I see him. I see him. I see him. He's right behind you.
[05:42.740 --> 05:43.900]  He's running. I got you. I got you.
[05:44.160 --> 05:45.880]  There goes Predator. I know. I got you.
[05:47.220 --> 05:49.000]  Fuck him up. Fuck him up. Kill Gavin. Kill Gavin.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.660]  He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.
[05:50.660 --> 05:52.920]  I'm disabling. I'm disabling the alarm.
[05:53.240 --> 05:55.520]  Yeah, put the jammer down. Oh, we got to kill this guy.
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.420]  Yeah, go kill that guy.
[05:57.700 --> 05:58.880]  Oh, I shot him in the back.
[05:59.420 --> 06:01.660]  All right. We've gathered all the...
[06:01.660 --> 06:04.540]  Oh, now we have to get the info on the tech location, working on it.
[06:05.640 --> 06:07.900]  Got the... I got the blood. I'm hiding behind this leaf.
[06:08.780 --> 06:09.460]  Is my health recharged?
[06:11.380 --> 06:13.660]  What are they doing?
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.660]  How do I tell who's real?
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.440]  They look real to me.
[06:19.780 --> 06:21.360]  Gathering info. Info gathered.
[06:21.560 --> 06:24.200]  I can assure you it doesn't take this long to pick up a brochure... brochure.
[06:28.040 --> 06:30.720]  Gathering info. Gathering info. Gathering info.
[06:30.920 --> 06:33.120]  Be on the lookout for da Predator.
[06:33.640 --> 06:34.660]  Input code sequence.
[06:35.140 --> 06:36.780]  All right, got to put the code sequence in.
[06:41.340 --> 06:42.660]  Input the correct sequence.
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.080]  4, 3, 2, 1. Where do we got to put it in?
[06:45.580 --> 06:47.540]  I don't know. It hasn't given us anywhere on the map yet.
[06:48.240 --> 06:49.120]  What is this?
[06:49.420 --> 06:50.440]  Ooh, bomb?
[06:51.780 --> 06:52.720]  What is that?
[06:54.180 --> 06:55.240]  Oh, we got it.
[06:56.100 --> 06:57.960]  So, 4, 3...
[06:57.960 --> 06:59.280]  I think I have one, maybe?
[07:01.200 --> 07:01.960]  There's two...
[07:01.960 --> 07:02.940]  Oh, I have two.
[07:04.100 --> 07:06.060]  No, no, it's two all around the same.
[07:06.620 --> 07:08.020]  Wait, what if we do it at the same time?
[07:08.880 --> 07:09.460]  No, no, no.
[07:09.460 --> 07:11.660]  Now it's left. Now it's this one.
[07:11.740 --> 07:12.360]  Oh, it's green.
[07:13.020 --> 07:13.620]  There you go.
[07:13.620 --> 07:16.180]  Wait for the time lock to disengage.
[07:16.260 --> 07:18.300]  Okay, so, be careful.
[07:18.420 --> 07:19.420]  Watch the doors, watch the doors.
[07:20.560 --> 07:22.320]  They're going to send AI and Predator.
[07:24.120 --> 07:25.040]  Geoff, you should get back in.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.200]  I'm just looking out to see.
[07:28.080 --> 07:28.920]  He's at the door!
[07:31.540 --> 07:31.980]  Shit!
[07:32.300 --> 07:32.920]  I can't see!
[07:33.300 --> 07:35.140]  I can't see a goddamn thing!
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.140]  Grenade!
[07:37.140 --> 07:37.180]  Grenade!
[07:42.440 --> 07:44.380]  Random ass guy just walked in like,
[07:44.480 --> 07:45.800]  What's going on in here?
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.820]  What are those guys screwing about?
[07:47.840 --> 07:49.020]  There's an alarm guy we gotta go kill.
[07:49.640 --> 07:51.500]  Go for it, I can watch them.
[07:51.700 --> 07:52.760]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.880]  Oh, we got triggered.
[07:56.080 --> 07:57.520]  Alright, well let's get ready.
[07:59.040 --> 07:59.720]  Shit's about to kick.
[08:01.940 --> 08:02.820]  Okay, just heal up.
[08:03.160 --> 08:04.200]  Oh, that feels good.
[08:05.600 --> 08:06.600]  We got it!
[08:06.940 --> 08:08.020]  Predator, Predator!
[08:10.020 --> 08:11.600]  Predator tech, Predator tech engaged!
[08:11.820 --> 08:13.640]  Alright, we got the Predator tech. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[08:13.880 --> 08:15.120]  Okay, let's do it.
[08:15.200 --> 08:17.540]  Inner Stargazer HQ. Okay, we're on our way, on our way.
[08:17.600 --> 08:18.100]  Let's do it.
[08:18.980 --> 08:20.380]  Thank God the Predator sucks.
[08:23.040 --> 08:24.840]  I think he might be in the tree.
[08:25.620 --> 08:26.180]  The tree.
[08:26.760 --> 08:27.640]  The singular tree.
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.600]  Shut the fuck up. Shut up.
[08:32.600 --> 08:33.980]  Look out, up in the tree.
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.380]  Come on, Nick, come on.
[08:37.820 --> 08:39.260]  I hope I never have to play Predator.
[08:39.400 --> 08:40.440]  I have no idea how to do it.
[08:40.880 --> 08:42.320]  Oh, you're playing Predator.
[08:42.320 --> 08:45.380]  I think whoever survives the longest should be Predator.
[08:45.560 --> 08:47.300]  No, it's gotta be Andrew. He wants to do it.
[08:47.320 --> 08:48.020]  He's the Predator man.
[08:49.660 --> 08:52.020]  Andrew keeps talking about wanting to beat the Predator.
[08:52.020 --> 08:52.760]  Oh, I'm gonna get in here.
[08:52.980 --> 08:57.540]  I don't think he used the word, though, when he said it though.
[08:59.940 --> 09:00.580]  I don't think he used the word, though, when he said it though.
[09:01.300 --> 09:02.640]  Over here. Come to me.
[09:03.920 --> 09:05.820]  Good move. I'm with you, I'm with you.
[09:06.460 --> 09:07.340]  We don't need no elevator.
[09:14.310 --> 09:16.030]  Just mashing AI to pieces.
[09:17.790 --> 09:19.450]  You wanna hop? Go straight across or go right?
[09:19.790 --> 09:20.990]  Let's hop and die.
[09:21.970 --> 09:23.570]  I'm gonna go right. I'm gonna disable this alarm.
[09:24.290 --> 09:25.690]  Oh, wow. Hey guys, what's up?
[09:26.170 --> 09:27.090]  Me and Nick ran across.
[09:28.130 --> 09:28.830]  Alarm disabled.
[09:30.670 --> 09:32.930]  Nice. Geoff's gone.
[09:33.350 --> 09:34.930]  Geoff? Oh, I'm on my way.
[09:35.710 --> 09:37.530]  Oh, Predator! Predator's back!
[09:37.790 --> 09:38.510]  I'm down!
[09:40.050 --> 09:40.830]  I'll come get you, buddy.
[09:41.770 --> 09:43.270]  Watch out for Predator. I'm gonna pick him up.
[09:43.810 --> 09:44.510]  I'm watching you.
[09:45.870 --> 09:47.650]  He went inside. I'm pretty sure he went inside.
[09:47.650 --> 09:48.930]  I hear him slashing some shit.
[09:50.290 --> 09:51.990]  Okay, look for the green blood on the ground.
[09:52.530 --> 09:53.730]  Oh, good call.
[09:55.850 --> 09:56.850]  He bleeds green.
[09:57.430 --> 09:58.490]  And we ain't got time to bleed.
[09:59.550 --> 10:00.790]  Like a Celtic.
[10:01.990 --> 10:03.910]  Ah! Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.
[10:08.110 --> 10:10.010]  Are you guys getting stabby?
[10:10.370 --> 10:11.350]  Or is that the Predator?
[10:11.710 --> 10:12.370]  Retrieval tech.
[10:13.130 --> 10:15.030]  Oh my god, it's everywhere.
[10:15.450 --> 10:16.810]  It's tech all over the place.
[10:18.470 --> 10:19.050]  Got it.
[10:19.450 --> 10:20.710]  Tech retrieved.
[10:21.110 --> 10:22.430]  Guys, we are in tech town now.
[10:22.970 --> 10:23.690]  Yeah, let's keep moving.
[10:25.390 --> 10:27.170]  Oh shit, that's big tech.
[10:30.330 --> 10:30.770]  Let's...
[10:30.770 --> 10:32.590]  No, it's the green.
[10:32.950 --> 10:34.330]  It's targeting me.
[10:36.150 --> 10:37.550]  I'm shooting the Predator in the back.
[10:37.630 --> 10:38.370]  I'm shooting the Predator.
[10:38.790 --> 10:39.550]  I'm down.
[10:42.490 --> 10:44.670]  I put 18 shotgun rounds in him.
[10:45.070 --> 10:46.290]  Nick, you gotta come get us, buddy.
[10:47.270 --> 10:48.330]  Oh god, I'm getting shot.
[10:48.850 --> 10:49.830]  Oh hello, soldier.
[10:51.030 --> 10:52.170]  I got you.
[10:53.130 --> 10:55.490]  Get the alarm guy.
[10:56.250 --> 10:57.530]  Hold on, I'm getting you.
[10:58.150 --> 10:59.150]  Alright, who do we gotta get?
[10:59.150 --> 11:01.170]  We're fine.
[11:02.650 --> 11:03.930]  He's down, he's down.
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.670]  Kill him, keep killing him.
[11:06.050 --> 11:06.930]  I'm gonna explode.
[11:08.970 --> 11:10.390]  Run, run, run.
[11:10.530 --> 11:12.250]  You're so far away.
[11:12.370 --> 11:13.470]  It's a nuclear bomb.
[11:16.210 --> 11:18.090]  Wait, Nick, you're leaving me.
[11:18.230 --> 11:19.110]  Son of a bitch.
[11:19.670 --> 11:20.750]  I was right here.
[11:21.190 --> 11:23.670]  I'm still in the blast range.
[11:23.670 --> 11:24.770]  I'm sending it back to you.
[11:26.170 --> 11:27.570]  I'm still in the blast range.
[11:27.570 --> 11:31.110]  I was on the fucking edge.
[11:32.350 --> 11:34.270]  Nick was the elevator.
[11:38.490 --> 11:41.130]  God damn son of a bitch killed us all.
[11:43.010 --> 11:44.010]  Oh boy.
[11:45.170 --> 11:46.070]  Wow. Shit.
[11:48.510 --> 11:50.650]  You killed every one of us, you prick.
[11:51.370 --> 11:52.410]  Wow. Did I really?
[11:53.190 --> 11:55.070]  Yes, we all died.
[11:55.090 --> 11:56.270]  We couldn't get out of the blast zone in time.
[11:56.790 --> 11:58.670]  That blast zone is huge.
[11:58.870 --> 11:59.850]  That's crazy.
[12:00.930 --> 12:03.270]  I may have doomed Andrew unintentionally.
[12:04.730 --> 12:08.130]  You took forever to hit the button and then as soon as I got there.
[12:11.590 --> 12:13.330]  That was a massive explosion.
[12:13.490 --> 12:14.430]  I got an achievement for that.
[12:16.450 --> 12:19.170]  Look at how much damage we had to put into the predator.
[12:19.530 --> 12:20.830]  God damn, that's crazy.
[12:21.530 --> 12:23.530]  Was that as fun for you as it was for me?
[12:23.970 --> 12:25.030]  Did you have a good time?
[12:25.030 --> 12:26.110]  I had a really great time.
[12:26.790 --> 12:32.610]  Gavin, you're going to hit in on the right stick until you're a blue icon.
[12:33.010 --> 12:35.530]  Oh, I'm sorry. Left stick.
[12:35.850 --> 12:37.030]  There you go.
[12:38.130 --> 12:39.770]  Now we're good. Now we got it.
[12:39.910 --> 12:40.970]  It's the same mission.
[12:41.430 --> 12:43.830]  We can ready up and now Andrew's the predator.
[12:44.190 --> 12:46.350]  Andrew's going to mute and deafen.
[12:46.490 --> 12:46.690]  We'll see.
[12:47.190 --> 12:49.290]  Except we're on Blackwater instead of headquarters this time.
[12:51.470 --> 12:52.850]  Andrew is the predator.
[12:52.850 --> 12:56.690]  That picture of Danny DeVito is so funny.
[13:00.670 --> 13:01.470]  Let's start.
[13:01.730 --> 13:02.830]  I think I want to start there.
[13:02.990 --> 13:03.450]  I think we're good.
[13:04.110 --> 13:05.430]  Do you need to pick a loadout?
[13:06.670 --> 13:08.530]  No, it's pretty straight forward.
[13:08.630 --> 13:11.110]  It's just pick a place to start and then we all start together.
[13:11.770 --> 13:14.010]  It's like you pick a default kind of loadout
[13:14.010 --> 13:15.410]  and then as you level up you unlock
[13:16.070 --> 13:16.790]  scopes and shit.
[13:17.550 --> 13:17.890]  Yeah.
[13:19.050 --> 13:21.770]  But we're all level zero so it doesn't matter.
[13:23.290 --> 13:24.630]  He's going to push our shit in.
[13:24.730 --> 13:26.730]  If I could do damage
[13:26.730 --> 13:27.990]  he's going to kill us.
[13:30.010 --> 13:31.770]  What was the hardest part?
[13:31.990 --> 13:34.490]  Was it trying to get everyone away from each other or what?
[13:36.370 --> 13:38.410]  My hardest part was finding out who was AI
[13:38.410 --> 13:39.110]  and who was real.
[13:40.990 --> 13:42.470]  Did the AI attack you?
[13:43.310 --> 13:44.990]  Yeah, but they're really weak.
[13:45.150 --> 13:46.730]  You just slap them in half basically.
[13:47.190 --> 13:48.810]  Did you realize that you were
[13:48.810 --> 13:50.510]  hunting Andrew a good chunk of the time?
[13:51.130 --> 13:51.590]  No.
[13:51.830 --> 13:53.910]  He felt specifically targeted by you.
[13:54.270 --> 13:55.730]  And with good reason.
[13:55.870 --> 13:58.230]  You seemed to very clearly be targeting him.
[13:58.590 --> 14:01.670]  You can climb really high in the trees
[14:01.670 --> 14:03.910]  so maybe getting a roof over our heads
[14:03.910 --> 14:04.570]  is a good deal.
[14:05.190 --> 14:07.450]  The whole mode of transportation for the predator
[14:07.450 --> 14:09.530]  for those that have never done it is to run through the trees
[14:09.530 --> 14:10.470]  go from limb to limb.
[14:11.010 --> 14:13.330]  Kind of like Assassin's Creed in Boston.
[14:13.870 --> 14:15.110]  I spent most of my time
[14:15.110 --> 14:17.590]  on foot running around and also crouching
[14:17.590 --> 14:18.570]  and hiding in a hospital.
[14:20.350 --> 14:22.010]  Were you just waiting for us?
[14:22.930 --> 14:24.910]  I was just trying to
[14:24.910 --> 14:25.530]  figure things out.
[14:25.710 --> 14:27.110]  See if my health recharged and all that.
[14:27.290 --> 14:27.810]  Did it recharge?
[14:28.190 --> 14:30.830]  I don't think so. It charged halfway back.
[14:32.510 --> 14:33.450]  I got a marker.
[14:34.550 --> 14:35.490]  Is this just...
[14:38.270 --> 14:38.930]  The red?
[14:39.110 --> 14:40.810]  I wonder if the red thing is just
[14:41.450 --> 14:43.450]  a general location or if it's
[14:43.450 --> 14:45.130]  where they are. We'll find out.
[14:45.210 --> 14:46.290]  We're just going to start running at it.
[14:49.900 --> 14:50.920]  But then at some point
[14:50.920 --> 14:52.480]  I did a big heel.
[14:53.920 --> 14:55.640]  I did a big heel.
[14:58.640 --> 15:00.040]  My weekly big heel.
[15:03.980 --> 15:04.940]  Primary objectives
[15:04.940 --> 15:07.060]  make sure we don't run into any of those alarm
[15:07.060 --> 15:09.000]  guys. If there are alarm guys
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.800]  just kill them. Oh, they're against us?
[15:11.420 --> 15:12.880]  Yes. We're like
[15:12.880 --> 15:14.660]  trying to complete a military mission
[15:14.660 --> 15:16.160]  and against
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.900]  who knows
[15:18.540 --> 15:21.200]  but at the same time we're getting hunted by the predator.
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.580]  It's kind of like the movie, you know?
[15:22.940 --> 15:25.280]  We're here on a mission and the predator also happens to be here.
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.100]  Yeah, it's really unfortunate.
[15:27.620 --> 15:28.980]  Yeah, it's bad timing on our part.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.060]  Oh, alarm man!
[15:31.900 --> 15:32.780]  I'm disabling
[15:33.520 --> 15:34.260]  the alarm.
[15:35.460 --> 15:37.220]  Ha, you idiot! I disabled the alarm.
[15:38.660 --> 15:40.980]  And then someone disabled that guy.
[15:41.840 --> 15:42.640]  Yeah, I disabled him.
[15:42.640 --> 15:43.740]  Are these gaming PCs?
[15:44.980 --> 15:47.200]  Yeah, you know like Razer products?
[15:50.980 --> 15:53.660]  Oh shit! He's blasting us!
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.740]  We have to steal the Turtle Beach prototype
[15:55.740 --> 15:57.020]  for Razer. He's up there!
[15:57.080 --> 15:57.760]  He's in the trees!
[15:59.540 --> 16:00.900]  He's in the trees? Yes.
[16:01.600 --> 16:03.000]  No, that doesn't sound right. Mark him.
[16:03.940 --> 16:05.360]  I tried. He disappeared.
[16:05.380 --> 16:05.900]  How do you mark him?
[16:07.640 --> 16:08.520]  I'm getting shot!
[16:08.700 --> 16:11.300]  There's still assholes running around. I'm trying to take them out while you guys
[16:11.300 --> 16:12.620]  look for him.
[16:14.480 --> 16:14.840]  Bastards.
[16:17.140 --> 16:17.860]  Oh, Jesus!
[16:18.040 --> 16:18.680]  This is not Gavin!
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.400]  Ah! He's on me!
[16:21.740 --> 16:21.920]  Getcha!
[16:24.320 --> 16:25.080]  Gavin's down here.
[16:27.520 --> 16:27.880]  Okay.
[16:28.160 --> 16:28.640]  I got you, Gav.
[16:31.760 --> 16:32.780]  I want to run inside.
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.060]  You know you can heal, right?
[16:35.860 --> 16:37.120]  How do you heal? Right bumper?
[16:37.420 --> 16:40.220]  Right bumper? But you can switch that
[16:41.220 --> 16:42.200]  Cover me, Gavin!
[16:43.240 --> 16:43.960]  Let me through!
[16:45.340 --> 16:45.740]  Run!
[16:47.640 --> 16:48.680]  Look out, Geoff! There's a grenade!
[16:49.580 --> 16:49.760]  Oh!
[16:51.640 --> 16:52.680]  He's above us!
[16:56.240 --> 16:56.900]  Come here, Andrew!
[16:57.140 --> 16:57.860]  Come here, you schmuck!
[17:04.340 --> 17:05.760]  Let's kick it off over there.
[17:06.420 --> 17:07.900]  There's a lot going on.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.580]  We gotta retrieve these drives.
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.620]  Yeah, let's go get the drives.
[17:11.700 --> 17:12.480]  Got it.
[17:13.620 --> 17:14.860]  There's only one more.
[17:14.860 --> 17:17.200]  I'm with you, Geoff.
[17:18.540 --> 17:19.540]  Let's stay together.
[17:20.640 --> 17:21.880]  I'm also covered in mud.
[17:21.920 --> 17:24.660]  I have a feeling Andrew's gonna be more capable than Gavin.
[17:25.520 --> 17:25.960]  No!
[17:26.340 --> 17:27.720]  So we should probably stay in pairs.
[17:28.340 --> 17:30.000]  Only because Gavin hasn't played it before.
[17:30.280 --> 17:32.000]  It's not an indictment on Gavin, anyway.
[17:33.360 --> 17:34.720]  Let's move to our next objective.
[17:34.720 --> 17:35.880]  I'm not trying to demoralize my teammate.
[17:36.040 --> 17:37.240]  Oh, I'm getting attacked!
[17:37.520 --> 17:38.100]  He's behind me!
[17:38.720 --> 17:40.360]  Now Predator was behind me, but not anymore.
[17:41.300 --> 17:43.420]  There he is! How do I mark him?
[17:43.420 --> 17:46.460]  Up on the D-pad.
[17:46.620 --> 17:47.800]  Okay, thank you very much.
[17:50.100 --> 17:51.720]  He's right here!
[17:52.920 --> 17:53.320]  Alright.
[17:55.360 --> 17:55.820]  I hit him!
[17:56.700 --> 17:57.020]  Grenade out!
[17:58.660 --> 17:59.820]  Did he throw that?
[18:00.440 --> 18:01.140]  No, I did.
[18:02.240 --> 18:04.720]  He's invisible, but you can still kinda see his outline.
[18:04.880 --> 18:05.060]  Yeah.
[18:06.500 --> 18:08.680]  He can only be invisible for so long.
[18:09.460 --> 18:10.280]  Oh, Geoff's moved.
[18:10.440 --> 18:10.780]  Let's go.
[18:10.780 --> 18:12.520]  Up the tree.
[18:12.780 --> 18:14.060]  I hear him. He's clicking.
[18:15.840 --> 18:17.340]  Heal up if you can.
[18:18.100 --> 18:19.740]  I think I'm good so far.
[18:20.220 --> 18:22.140]  This is like Assassin's Creed.
[18:22.700 --> 18:24.860]  Just make sure you're switched to the right thing.
[18:25.000 --> 18:25.500]  If you need a...
[18:25.500 --> 18:27.140]  He's behind me!
[18:27.300 --> 18:28.560]  Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
[18:30.300 --> 18:31.460]  Did someone flush by me?
[18:31.520 --> 18:31.900]  What happened?
[18:33.500 --> 18:36.100]  He zaps. He has electricity or something.
[18:36.320 --> 18:38.520]  He's in the killing fields!
[18:38.780 --> 18:39.000]  Jesus!
[18:39.640 --> 18:41.340]  I'm planting the explosives, guys. Don't worry.
[18:41.400 --> 18:44.020]  Keep doing what you're doing. We're gonna be on the lookout for him.
[18:45.740 --> 18:46.060]  Headshot.
[18:46.540 --> 18:47.820]  He appears to be Nick.
[18:48.000 --> 18:48.580]  He's over...
[18:50.440 --> 18:50.760]  Sorry!
[18:52.400 --> 18:54.140]  I thought that was heal, but it wasn't.
[18:54.600 --> 18:55.180]  There's a sniper!
[18:55.920 --> 18:57.140]  Yeah, there's a couple snipers.
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.700]  I'm gonna see if I can move up and get him.
[19:01.280 --> 19:01.920]  Got him.
[19:02.620 --> 19:03.260]  Almost done.
[19:04.180 --> 19:05.140]  Oh, shit! You can run out of ammo?
[19:06.020 --> 19:06.660]  Sniper down.
[19:07.840 --> 19:09.400]  You guys killing the snipers helps a lot.
[19:09.440 --> 19:10.060]  Thank you.
[19:11.640 --> 19:13.880]  So many people behind me.
[19:13.960 --> 19:14.080]  Ah!
[19:15.200 --> 19:15.560]  Nice!
[19:17.960 --> 19:18.560]  Good grenade!
[19:19.240 --> 19:21.600]  Looks like there's one more explosive to plant over that way.
[19:22.580 --> 19:23.360]  I'm heading that way.
[19:24.800 --> 19:25.960]  I'm with you, Gavin.
[19:26.580 --> 19:28.060]  Gavin, I'm up here with you.
[19:28.240 --> 19:28.600]  Does anyone have ammo?
[19:29.660 --> 19:31.040]  Oh, dude! That's Predator!
[19:31.900 --> 19:32.920]  Oh, he's up in the trees!
[19:33.780 --> 19:34.520]  He's up in the trees!
[19:35.440 --> 19:37.080]  Look in buildings and shit.
[19:40.540 --> 19:42.000]  He separated me.
[19:42.860 --> 19:43.840]  Where are you?
[19:44.000 --> 19:44.960]  By the sticks.
[19:45.980 --> 19:47.580]  Let's go to Gavin, Nick.
[19:48.020 --> 19:48.520]  I'm with you.
[19:50.280 --> 19:53.360]  He was up in the tree last I saw.
[19:53.980 --> 19:54.940]  I'm real hurt.
[19:55.260 --> 19:55.940]  I'm looking for ammo.
[19:56.120 --> 19:58.340]  Oh, no. There's a sniper.
[19:59.980 --> 20:01.020]  Oh, shit!
[20:01.760 --> 20:02.520]  That's a Predator!
[20:04.860 --> 20:05.740]  He's invisible.
[20:05.900 --> 20:07.440]  He's over here.
[20:10.220 --> 20:11.000]  He's right there.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.180]  I hit him a few times.
[20:13.740 --> 20:14.940]  Over that way.
[20:15.820 --> 20:16.420]  I hear his ass.
[20:17.620 --> 20:18.460]  I'm with Eric.
[20:19.560 --> 20:20.700]  Oh, he's right behind you!
[20:21.420 --> 20:22.680]  Damn it. I'm down.
[20:22.880 --> 20:24.400]  Just keep hitting him.
[20:25.900 --> 20:26.860]  Thank you.
[20:28.020 --> 20:29.860]  He is in...
[20:29.860 --> 20:30.960]  Oh, sniper!
[20:30.960 --> 20:34.320]  I hit him.
[20:34.600 --> 20:35.620]  He's bleeding.
[20:36.460 --> 20:37.600]  Gavin, I got you.
[20:38.460 --> 20:40.000]  He ran off.
[20:40.220 --> 20:41.560]  He's up in the trees.
[20:42.360 --> 20:43.280]  He's up there.
[20:44.120 --> 20:45.200]  I'm reloading.
[20:46.240 --> 20:46.860]  Can he...
[20:46.860 --> 20:47.540]  Okay.
[20:49.520 --> 20:50.600]  He's up there.
[20:51.100 --> 20:52.560]  I need ammo so bad.
[20:53.800 --> 20:55.700]  I don't need a shit.
[20:56.540 --> 20:58.080]  Let's go see if we can find you ammo, Gav.
[20:58.840 --> 20:59.120]  Okay.
[21:00.280 --> 21:01.520]  Reach drop pod. Is that it?
[21:01.600 --> 21:02.020]  Are we done?
[21:03.520 --> 21:04.320]  Let's go.
[21:05.640 --> 21:06.500]  Let's just do it.
[21:08.500 --> 21:10.240]  There might be ammo there.
[21:10.720 --> 21:11.380]  Alright, me and Geoff.
[21:13.840 --> 21:14.640]  Initializing detonation.
[21:15.300 --> 21:16.260]  Let's go to the drop point.
[21:16.840 --> 21:17.420]  Wait, that's optional?
[21:18.900 --> 21:20.800]  The truck flew up right on me.
[21:21.100 --> 21:22.980]  I had to do something to it.
[21:23.300 --> 21:23.700]  I'm getting you.
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.080]  I got him.
[21:25.740 --> 21:26.700]  Fuck the optional thing.
[21:26.700 --> 21:27.600]  He's on top.
[21:29.920 --> 21:30.920]  He's on the ground.
[21:31.140 --> 21:31.540]  I'm nuking.
[21:32.680 --> 21:35.080]  Go. Run.
[21:35.920 --> 21:37.080]  I didn't get any of them.
[21:37.200 --> 21:39.220]  Just run.
[21:40.440 --> 21:41.420]  We're almost there.
[21:41.820 --> 21:42.480]  We're almost there.
[21:42.940 --> 21:43.780]  Come back.
[21:45.180 --> 21:45.660]  Yes.
[21:47.900 --> 21:49.300]  They definitely got away.
[21:49.300 --> 21:50.140]  We're out of here.
[21:50.300 --> 21:52.700]  We have to defend ourselves at the exfil.
[21:53.700 --> 21:54.340]  That's bad.
[21:54.340 --> 21:56.020]  You survived.
[21:56.380 --> 21:58.400]  I think we have to exfil if he's dead.
[21:58.540 --> 21:59.760]  No, I think we did it.
[22:00.960 --> 22:01.440]  Predator!
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.260]  Hold on.
[22:05.840 --> 22:06.680]  We did it.
[22:07.340 --> 22:08.600]  Let's watch our cutscene.
[22:08.980 --> 22:10.260]  Let's watch our cutscene.
[22:11.940 --> 22:12.960]  We're down there waving.
[22:13.100 --> 22:15.360]  That's where he exploded, but we're on the chopper because we rock.
[22:16.420 --> 22:16.920]  It was.
[22:17.480 --> 22:18.180]  How'd that go, Andrew?
[22:18.720 --> 22:20.140]  There's a little bit of a learning curve.
[22:20.980 --> 22:21.860]  But it's fun.
[22:21.860 --> 22:24.640]  Do you want to be Predator one more time?
[22:24.740 --> 22:24.900]  Sure.
[22:28.100 --> 22:30.160]  Instead of having to learn the buttons and go,
[22:30.220 --> 22:30.700]  Oh, what the fuck?
[22:31.100 --> 22:32.160]  You kind of know now.
[22:32.360 --> 22:34.700]  I feel like it's going to move it up.
[22:34.920 --> 22:35.760]  This is...
[22:36.760 --> 22:39.000]  Why didn't this game take off?
[22:39.520 --> 22:40.260]  I have no idea.
[22:41.860 --> 22:42.980]  I'm having a great time.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.880]  Part of it was it didn't come out on consoles.
[22:45.220 --> 22:46.860]  This just launched on the Xbox.
[22:47.300 --> 22:47.960]  Are you serious?
[22:48.460 --> 22:49.420]  I came out on PlayStation.
[22:49.940 --> 22:52.120]  Oh, it was only PlayStation?
[22:52.540 --> 22:54.520]  I didn't even know that.
[22:55.060 --> 22:56.470]  Was anybody else disappointed
[22:56.880 --> 22:58.480]  when they were a kid and they learned
[22:58.480 --> 23:00.820]  that when they talk about gorillas like that,
[23:00.900 --> 23:03.320]  they're not talking about a group of
[23:03.320 --> 23:04.800]  intelligent apes
[23:04.800 --> 23:06.700]  that live in the jungle and are freedom fighters?
[23:07.540 --> 23:09.360]  I think it was a pretty big blow to me.
[23:10.600 --> 23:12.300]  It never occurred to me, I guess.
[23:12.460 --> 23:13.880]  Maybe it did, I just don't remember.
[23:17.940 --> 23:19.080]  I'm more upset that
[23:19.080 --> 23:21.660]  gold bars as currency isn't a normal thing.
[23:21.680 --> 23:22.340]  You and Joel Heyman.
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.780]  So fucking funny, dude.
[23:35.540 --> 23:37.120]  I like how much Eric liked that.
[23:39.400 --> 23:41.420]  I felt like it was a pretty obvious joke.
[23:41.860 --> 23:44.120]  I felt like the strength of the joke
[23:44.120 --> 23:45.500]  was just how fast I was with it,
[23:45.520 --> 23:46.720]  but the joke itself was really strong.
[23:47.720 --> 23:49.420]  The strength was how fast you were
[23:49.420 --> 23:50.660]  and how funny you found it.
[23:54.440 --> 23:56.580]  Imagine just being known for that.
[23:57.340 --> 23:59.860]  That's the thing people know you for.
[24:00.260 --> 24:03.460]  I keep firing on accident.
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.200]  In the tree!
[24:06.660 --> 24:07.400]  Is it a sniper?
[24:08.760 --> 24:09.540]  It's the Pred!
[24:11.220 --> 24:12.020]  It's gotta be.
[24:12.820 --> 24:15.520]  These dudes are fucking tough, by the way.
[24:16.980 --> 24:17.940]  Jesus Christ.
[24:18.180 --> 24:19.900]  I ran right into some...
[24:19.900 --> 24:20.580]  Well, some of them aren't.
[24:20.940 --> 24:22.940]  The armored ones are fucking brutal.
[24:24.620 --> 24:25.100]  Pig!
[24:26.860 --> 24:28.140]  You killed a pig?
[24:28.300 --> 24:28.940]  Yeah, I killed a hog.
[24:29.320 --> 24:31.620]  You got hog wild?
[24:32.960 --> 24:33.620]  On me!
[24:34.980 --> 24:35.740]  Hog on me.
[24:38.540 --> 24:40.020]  You know what else has hogs?
[24:40.220 --> 24:40.520]  DTA?
[24:41.300 --> 24:43.080]  Yeah, just something to think about.
[24:43.080 --> 24:45.320]  Oh, I found some more Veritasium.
[24:45.700 --> 24:48.460]  That makes you Wolverine, according to Nick.
[24:48.460 --> 24:48.980]  Oh, is that ammo?
[24:49.400 --> 24:49.880]  What is that?
[24:50.480 --> 24:50.940]  Veritanium.
[24:52.680 --> 24:54.160]  An owlf recording.
[24:54.540 --> 24:55.320]  Dude, owlf tapes?
[24:55.840 --> 24:56.760]  Owlf recording.
[24:57.240 --> 24:57.900]  What is this?
[25:01.680 --> 25:02.840]  What'd you get?
[25:03.960 --> 25:05.280]  A fucking shotgun?
[25:05.460 --> 25:07.100]  Did you get some collectibtanium or whatever?
[25:08.040 --> 25:09.080]  Yeah, I got collectibtanium.
[25:09.460 --> 25:10.780]  You guys got shotguns?
[25:11.340 --> 25:12.620]  Yeah, I got a shotgun, dude.
[25:14.280 --> 25:16.220]  There was one down over there.
[25:16.220 --> 25:17.200]  Oh, we gotta kill that alarm guy.
[25:17.560 --> 25:18.460]  Yeah, I got him.
[25:19.200 --> 25:19.760]  He's dead.
[25:21.340 --> 25:23.380]  It might just be a handgun now.
[25:24.000 --> 25:24.400]  Veritanium?
[25:26.400 --> 25:27.760]  It's so much veritanium.
[25:28.200 --> 25:29.180]  Bust out the claws, Geoff.
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.120]  Oh, cool, you did it.
[25:31.260 --> 25:31.880]  Defend the laptop.
[25:33.360 --> 25:34.740]  Kill the alarm guy.
[25:34.980 --> 25:37.000]  And then we have to defend this laptop over here.
[25:38.400 --> 25:40.220]  Yeah, there's a laptop over here that we just...
[25:41.060 --> 25:42.500]  Not a predator.
[25:43.360 --> 25:44.640]  It's a laptop, right?
[25:44.740 --> 25:46.900]  The security footage clearly shows
[25:46.900 --> 25:48.860]  that there's no way the laptop
[25:48.860 --> 25:50.320]  could have committed the crime.
[25:50.780 --> 25:53.020]  It was in a completely different location
[25:53.020 --> 25:55.020]  at a different part of town
[25:55.020 --> 25:57.220]  at the exact time stamp
[25:57.220 --> 25:59.500]  said crime was said to be committed.
[25:59.900 --> 26:00.780]  I rest my case.
[26:02.200 --> 26:02.860]  Guilty.
[26:03.240 --> 26:03.720]  Protected.
[26:06.220 --> 26:07.500]  Where's the predator?
[26:08.580 --> 26:10.020]  Is he just waiting us out
[26:10.020 --> 26:11.400]  Yeah, I think so.
[26:12.160 --> 26:14.560]  Predator's in recess re-evaluating the data.
[26:14.700 --> 26:16.480]  He's trying to figure out what to do with the
[26:17.940 --> 26:18.360]  recent...
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.420]  Killing a few guys coming in this way.
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.880]  He was pretty moved by your defense
[26:22.880 --> 26:23.800]  of the laptop, I think.
[26:29.560 --> 26:30.520]  We're almost there.
[26:31.100 --> 26:31.540]  I hear him.
[26:32.480 --> 26:32.900]  Where?
[26:34.080 --> 26:35.160]  Oh, I hear him. He's clicking.
[26:36.900 --> 26:39.020]  Tag the general location if you can.
[26:39.020 --> 26:41.520]  I would say maybe around...
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.340]  We'll just use the up d-pad thing.
[26:43.460 --> 26:44.400]  I did.
[26:45.620 --> 26:47.420]  Got a gold bar.
[26:48.100 --> 26:49.340]  You know, I was reading the other day
[26:49.340 --> 26:51.560]  that Costco sold gold bars for a while
[26:51.560 --> 26:54.140]  and they made like a hundred million dollars.
[26:54.820 --> 26:55.900]  Holy shit, that's awesome.
[26:56.340 --> 26:58.320]  I started shopping at Costco at the wrong time.
[26:58.720 --> 26:59.340]  Geoff, meet Geoff.
[26:59.900 --> 27:01.300]  Oh, he's over here!
[27:01.440 --> 27:03.080]  He's milking it! He's on me!
[27:03.340 --> 27:04.140]  He's on me!
[27:06.460 --> 27:07.680]  He's slicing Nick up!
[27:07.680 --> 27:09.500]  Oh, he's slicing me to pieces!
[27:11.080 --> 27:11.780]  What happened?
[27:12.040 --> 27:14.620]  He was like killing you.
[27:14.620 --> 27:15.500]  Did he steal you?
[27:16.100 --> 27:16.780]  I'm alive!
[27:17.420 --> 27:20.180]  He was trying to waste you.
[27:20.180 --> 27:20.740]  Did we kill him?
[27:21.540 --> 27:22.740]  No, he ran off.
[27:22.840 --> 27:23.300]  He's pretty hurt.
[27:23.740 --> 27:26.820]  We killed him. He'd be blowing up right now.
[27:27.300 --> 27:27.700]  Oh, he's there!
[27:28.720 --> 27:29.360]  He's back!
[27:30.140 --> 27:32.900]  We're gonna be in some trouble if he blows up in here.
[27:33.720 --> 27:35.220]  No, we can get out of here.
[27:35.220 --> 27:36.940]  Maybe it would...
[27:38.740 --> 27:40.200]  block some of the explosion.
[27:41.420 --> 27:42.240]  Hang on, I'm putting on mud.
[27:42.420 --> 27:43.700]  Reach the dig camp.
[27:45.480 --> 27:46.380]  Oh, he's aiming!
[27:46.660 --> 27:47.140]  He's aiming!
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.020]  Where'd he go?
[27:54.080 --> 27:54.880]  Let's just run.
[27:55.980 --> 27:57.280]  Oh, shit!
[27:57.500 --> 27:57.820]  Oh, balls!
[28:00.820 --> 28:01.700]  What's up?
[28:01.960 --> 28:03.500]  What does a shit-o-fuck-o-balls mean?
[28:03.800 --> 28:05.200]  Was any of that words?
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.100]  I heard balls.
[28:08.180 --> 28:09.540]  Predators right here.
[28:09.620 --> 28:11.240]  He's gonna be coming around this other side.
[28:11.240 --> 28:14.440]  He'll be coming around the other side very soon.
[28:14.800 --> 28:15.380]  Here he comes.
[28:16.600 --> 28:17.240]  Oh, there he goes!
[28:17.540 --> 28:19.160]  Oh, he's back!
[28:19.620 --> 28:20.200]  He went left.
[28:21.560 --> 28:23.020]  I shot Eric a lot.
[28:23.820 --> 28:25.740]  Okay, we gotta pull back. We gotta readjust.
[28:27.160 --> 28:28.780]  My health is low.
[28:29.300 --> 28:29.880]  Should we keep going?
[28:29.960 --> 28:31.600]  Or should we have our stand here?
[28:32.320 --> 28:33.640]  I think we should try to...
[28:33.640 --> 28:35.220]  Okay, let's move in.
[28:36.100 --> 28:38.240]  He's gonna be right behind us, but I think we're gonna be okay.
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.240]  Yeah, we'll be right in front of him. That's all good.
[28:40.880 --> 28:42.080]  That's an excellent point, Nick.
[28:45.860 --> 28:48.340]  He's not behind, but we're in front of him.
[28:48.940 --> 28:49.520]  That's right.
[28:50.000 --> 28:50.620]  He's on the roof.
[28:51.500 --> 28:52.120]  Our roof?
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.520]  No, he's on the cave.
[28:53.680 --> 28:54.780]  You gotta tag it.
[28:58.220 --> 28:59.620]  He's on the move this way.
[28:59.760 --> 29:00.320]  Here he comes.
[29:03.620 --> 29:05.780]  I threw a grenade in the area that he's in.
[29:05.840 --> 29:07.000]  He's coming around this way.
[29:10.020 --> 29:10.380]  Kill.
[29:11.780 --> 29:13.440]  Alright, I got the ID or whatever.
[29:13.480 --> 29:13.600]  Disabling the alarm.
[29:15.960 --> 29:16.280]  Oh!
[29:20.320 --> 29:21.000]  I hear him.
[29:22.080 --> 29:22.940]  He's up in the trees.
[29:23.840 --> 29:26.460]  Oh, I see him.
[29:26.880 --> 29:27.520]  He's right there.
[29:27.580 --> 29:28.260]  Yeah, he's up in the trees.
[29:28.400 --> 29:29.660]  Oh yeah, he's leaving his green goo stain.
[29:30.420 --> 29:30.640]  Yep.
[29:30.640 --> 29:32.520]  The finest of the goo.
[29:34.060 --> 29:34.860]  He's still up there.
[29:35.920 --> 29:37.340]  He's on the move.
[29:37.460 --> 29:38.140]  Directly above us.
[29:39.940 --> 29:40.620]  Tree above.
[29:42.600 --> 29:43.760]  The tree above the tree?
[29:43.900 --> 29:44.380]  What are you saying?
[29:44.760 --> 29:45.480]  Let's keep going.
[29:48.000 --> 29:48.920]  Start that. We'll cover.
[29:50.080 --> 29:50.480]  He's up.
[29:50.660 --> 29:54.220]  He's up there.
[29:54.520 --> 29:55.560]  He's moving down.
[29:56.680 --> 29:57.800]  He's on this tree.
[29:57.800 --> 29:59.340]  There you go.
[30:01.360 --> 30:01.820]  Fuck.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.260]  I lost him.
[30:05.680 --> 30:06.380]  I'm healing.
[30:07.760 --> 30:08.540]  Watch your health.
[30:09.400 --> 30:10.560]  Oh shit, I should heal.
[30:11.360 --> 30:11.620]  Yes.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.240]  Okay, we're on the last part of this mission.
[30:17.140 --> 30:18.300]  Let's stay together here.
[30:18.320 --> 30:19.080]  Do we have to do the optional?
[30:20.920 --> 30:21.800]  There you go.
[30:21.820 --> 30:22.320]  Let's do the optional.
[30:24.020 --> 30:25.060]  Let's kill him.
[30:25.620 --> 30:27.080]  I ran out of ammo again.
[30:27.140 --> 30:29.120]  Son of a bitch.
[30:32.860 --> 30:33.560]  What's up?
[30:35.380 --> 30:36.460]  Eric screamed.
[30:38.100 --> 30:40.580]  I'm way away from you guys.
[30:40.740 --> 30:41.120]  Oh shit.
[30:41.560 --> 30:42.900]  I'm not even close.
[30:43.020 --> 30:46.000]  I thought we were killing the guys who were coming for us.
[30:46.440 --> 30:47.740]  I'm even further than you.
[30:47.760 --> 30:48.800]  Predators on me.
[30:49.860 --> 30:50.520]  Come back.
[30:52.660 --> 30:54.260]  We're on our way.
[30:54.260 --> 30:57.200]  On our way.
[30:59.320 --> 30:59.960]  Gotcha.
[31:01.040 --> 31:02.260]  Stop them.
[31:02.300 --> 31:02.500]  No.
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.560]  We gotta go.
[31:06.520 --> 31:07.160]  Run.
[31:09.780 --> 31:11.060]  Run fools.
[31:11.380 --> 31:12.340]  Shit, they're gonna escape.
[31:13.440 --> 31:13.760]  Run.
[31:14.900 --> 31:17.380]  My skull and spine came out of my body.
[31:17.560 --> 31:18.040]  I'm almost there.
[31:19.040 --> 31:20.640]  I'm gonna make it.
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.160]  I made it.
[31:24.180 --> 31:25.280]  Poor Eric's spine.
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.880]  That was his favorite feature.
[31:28.040 --> 31:29.300]  That was my favorite spine, yeah.
[31:29.380 --> 31:32.520]  He made the most of the one time you were alone there.
[31:32.640 --> 31:32.980]  He did well.
[31:33.460 --> 31:34.380]  He really did.
[31:34.580 --> 31:37.080]  I thought we were standing our ground killing those guys
[31:37.080 --> 31:38.240]  that were gonna try to take out the predator.
[31:38.480 --> 31:39.020]  I was wrong.
[31:39.120 --> 31:40.740]  Geoff and I said we're gonna go get the option.
[31:41.920 --> 31:43.820]  I thought the optional stuff was killing those guys.
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.440]  No, that was another option.
[31:47.020 --> 31:48.980]  I just went to the optional thing on the map.
[31:49.080 --> 31:50.540]  I thought that's what we said.
[31:50.540 --> 31:53.500]  At the end of the day, the majority survived
[31:54.040 --> 31:55.220]  and we killed a predator
[31:55.220 --> 31:57.580]  and sometimes you gotta break a few Eric eggs.
[31:58.660 --> 31:59.620]  Andrew, how'd that feel?
[32:00.780 --> 32:01.500]  Very confused
[32:01.500 --> 32:02.800]  because of the map change.
[32:03.160 --> 32:05.740]  I learned the buttons more but I didn't know where anything was.
[32:08.040 --> 32:09.060]  Let's run that back.
[32:09.140 --> 32:10.060]  I think I can get you guys.
[32:11.640 --> 32:13.560]  You wanna do same map?
[32:13.560 --> 32:14.240]  I'm level 12.
[32:15.900 --> 32:16.980]  Okay, same map. Let's do it.
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.440]  It was very funny to be hitting you in the back
[32:18.440 --> 32:20.720]  Little soldier jumps.
[32:20.880 --> 32:23.640]  I was just like, how can I get away from this?
[32:23.700 --> 32:24.660]  If I stop, I'm toast.
[32:25.640 --> 32:27.160]  Excavation at night. Let's try night.
[32:27.460 --> 32:28.620]  Okay, that's cool.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.760]  Night time.
[32:31.980 --> 32:32.600]  Night time.
[32:33.780 --> 32:34.120]  Okay.
[32:36.500 --> 32:37.820]  Alright, Andrew Deffin.
[32:37.900 --> 32:38.620]  We're gonna kill you.
[32:40.200 --> 32:41.480]  Okay, so now that he's
[32:42.140 --> 32:43.320]  Let's go to a different
[32:44.160 --> 32:45.100]  launch this time.
[32:45.740 --> 32:46.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[32:47.180 --> 32:49.220]  What if we just sat in a building
[32:49.220 --> 32:50.000]  the whole game?
[32:51.180 --> 32:51.720]  Yeah, Western Creek.
[32:52.480 --> 32:53.700]  I don't know if there's a timer.
[32:54.040 --> 32:55.640]  But if not, I think we can do that.
[32:57.660 --> 32:59.140]  You can change your
[32:59.140 --> 33:00.960]  custom loadouts here but you can't change
[33:00.960 --> 33:01.960]  what your actual loadouts are.
[33:03.120 --> 33:04.520]  So it's slightly different
[33:05.080 --> 33:07.200]  mission pieces here where we're
[33:07.200 --> 33:08.900]  finding weapon shipments
[33:08.900 --> 33:10.740]  taking pictures of the weapons and destroying the arsenal
[33:10.740 --> 33:12.500]  but I think it's all gonna be pretty close.
[33:12.680 --> 33:14.880]  Weapon shipments.
[33:15.280 --> 33:16.240]  Predator already has me.
[33:16.280 --> 33:16.960]  How was that shotgun?
[33:18.360 --> 33:20.780]  Great. Really strong against the small guys
[33:20.780 --> 33:22.500]  and then the guys that were a little bit heavier
[33:22.500 --> 33:25.460]  they were taking a lot of damage with it.
[33:25.680 --> 33:27.040]  I was trying to use it against the Predator
[33:27.040 --> 33:29.460]  but he never got really close
[33:29.460 --> 33:30.120]  close enough for that.
[33:30.120 --> 33:32.120]  I use a shotgun as a secondary
[33:32.540 --> 33:33.560]  and it's really good.
[33:33.960 --> 33:36.180]  You can use a shotgun as a secondary
[33:36.180 --> 33:37.240]  and then you don't have to give up.
[33:39.320 --> 33:40.520]  I'm gonna use that as my secondary.
[33:40.700 --> 33:41.280]  It was fantastic.
[33:41.980 --> 33:44.200]  I'm not sure how accurate I need to be
[33:44.200 --> 33:44.860]  with the blaster.
[33:45.640 --> 33:46.800]  I think I'm learning a little bit.
[33:46.860 --> 33:47.520]  It's definitely
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.700]  the swinging, the stabbing
[33:51.700 --> 33:53.720]  popping claws is the way to go.
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.600]  Oh, we have night vision by the way.
[33:56.220 --> 33:58.060]  What button is that? Hold down on the D-pad.
[33:59.320 --> 34:00.160]  Down on the D-pad?
[34:00.440 --> 34:01.660]  Yeah, hold it. Oh, cool.
[34:03.660 --> 34:04.000]  Nice.
[34:04.580 --> 34:05.860]  Oh, that guy, did you see his head go?
[34:06.240 --> 34:07.640]  Yeah. Yeah, it's gone.
[34:07.640 --> 34:09.440]  I had to take it away from him.
[34:09.440 --> 34:11.040]  Head confiscation.
[34:11.480 --> 34:14.360]  I needed his thoughts.
[34:17.300 --> 34:19.460]  Geoff the brain bug over here.
[34:19.580 --> 34:20.400]  Oh, no.
[34:21.440 --> 34:22.320]  It's afraid.
[34:24.100 --> 34:24.980]  She's afraid!
[34:27.380 --> 34:28.440]  Brett! Oh, nope, just a guy.
[34:28.600 --> 34:28.980]  Thought it was Brett.
[34:30.980 --> 34:33.140]  He's gonna let you shoot some stuff
[34:33.140 --> 34:33.880]  but not lights.
[34:34.600 --> 34:36.480]  Yeah, you gotta be able to shoot lights, right?
[34:36.600 --> 34:37.160]  It's so stupid.
[34:39.380 --> 34:39.820]  Brett!
[34:43.020 --> 34:43.460]  Weapons!
[34:43.700 --> 34:44.360]  Hey Geoff, look at this.
[34:45.260 --> 34:46.620]  Oh, there's a first aid thing.
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.180]  Alright, hold on. Do I need my night vision on?
[34:50.340 --> 34:50.560]  No.
[34:51.140 --> 34:53.840]  Look at this. Do you see what it says on the label?
[34:56.200 --> 34:57.880]  Uh, it says...
[34:57.880 --> 34:59.660]  Oh! Yeah, it does.
[35:00.260 --> 35:01.940]  It says flammable. That was really good.
[35:02.360 --> 35:03.540]  You showed me.
[35:04.520 --> 35:05.040]  Pretty good.
[35:05.960 --> 35:07.580]  You got that, Nick?
[35:08.320 --> 35:09.420]  Yeah, he's got it.
[35:09.500 --> 35:11.960]  It wanted me to shoot that.
[35:12.660 --> 35:13.540]  What are we supposed to...
[35:13.540 --> 35:14.260]  Oh, take pictures.
[35:14.660 --> 35:17.340]  You can pick up ammo off dead guys, too.
[35:17.620 --> 35:20.120]  Yes, I just did that. And I covered myself in mud.
[35:21.360 --> 35:22.200]  Where's the mud hole?
[35:22.900 --> 35:23.440]  I don't know.
[35:23.560 --> 35:26.040]  It's just like a square thing on the ground sometimes.
[35:26.280 --> 35:28.000]  Sometimes you find a prompt for it.
[35:28.200 --> 35:28.340]  Yeah.
[35:29.140 --> 35:29.980]  Look straight at the mud.
[35:32.520 --> 35:33.900]  Oh, you need mud? Look at the mud.
[35:33.900 --> 35:36.320]  Yeah, seriously. Just look straight down.
[35:36.820 --> 35:37.360]  Oh, predator!
[35:38.100 --> 35:39.320]  He's on me!
[35:40.540 --> 35:41.340]  He jumped.
[35:42.740 --> 35:43.900]  Ow! I'm down.
[35:44.440 --> 35:47.200]  I parried. I punched him in the face.
[35:47.320 --> 35:47.640]  Ow!
[35:48.540 --> 35:49.680]  Can someone shoot him?
[35:50.540 --> 35:52.560]  Ryan, he's gotta get away.
[35:52.900 --> 35:53.940]  We're getting you up.
[35:54.080 --> 35:54.540]  Thank you.
[35:55.500 --> 35:58.420]  You can right stick and punch him.
[35:58.780 --> 35:59.400]  Thank you.
[36:00.900 --> 36:01.880]  He's right here!
[36:01.880 --> 36:03.220]  He's right here!
[36:04.940 --> 36:06.920]  What do you wanna...
[36:06.920 --> 36:07.660]  Let's get in the building.
[36:07.880 --> 36:08.240]  Ow!
[36:10.280 --> 36:11.300]  In the building!
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.020]  I'm healing up.
[36:14.560 --> 36:15.800]  Okay, there you go.
[36:16.500 --> 36:17.400]  Get in the building with Nick.
[36:18.020 --> 36:18.780]  I'll cover you.
[36:20.800 --> 36:22.400]  Getting in the building with Gavin and Nick.
[36:23.220 --> 36:24.320]  That's the other building, Geoff.
[36:25.180 --> 36:26.280]  Getting in the wrong building.
[36:27.600 --> 36:28.700]  I'm guarding the other door.
[36:29.440 --> 36:30.160]  I don't wanna go to Claymore.
[36:32.400 --> 36:33.620]  Fuck, I wish I had grenades.
[36:34.080 --> 36:35.900]  Yeah, I got grenades. You want me to drop them?
[36:39.400 --> 36:40.080]  Watch your health.
[36:40.360 --> 36:40.980]  Here he comes!
[36:42.900 --> 36:43.580]  He's circling.
[36:45.100 --> 36:46.440]  He's hiding under the stairs.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.700]  Oh shit, there's three doors to this building.
[36:51.360 --> 36:51.620]  Oh boy.
[36:53.120 --> 36:53.920]  I hear him.
[36:57.450 --> 36:58.490]  Hey, we got windows.
[36:59.310 --> 37:00.190]  That's defense, baby.
[37:02.010 --> 37:03.230]  He's never gonna come in here.
[37:03.790 --> 37:05.150]  Should we do Bombay?
[37:05.290 --> 37:06.810]  I'll bend over and stick my ass out the door.
[37:16.570 --> 37:17.710]  Where's the moon button?
[37:20.030 --> 37:21.090]  I think we should...
[37:21.570 --> 37:23.750]  I think we should make a break for the weapons truck.
[37:24.070 --> 37:25.230]  Tap X to slap ass.
[37:25.510 --> 37:26.190]  Here's the thing.
[37:26.970 --> 37:28.610]  Me and Gavin will start going.
[37:28.810 --> 37:29.930]  You guys stagger out.
[37:29.930 --> 37:31.130]  Give us a minute.
[37:32.110 --> 37:34.130]  Alright, Gavin, we're gonna make our move.
[37:34.250 --> 37:34.390]  Let's go.
[37:35.230 --> 37:38.910]  See if he comes out for us.
[37:42.370 --> 37:43.310]  He's on the roof!
[37:44.290 --> 37:44.950]  Where's the backup?
[37:46.150 --> 37:47.370]  We staggered out.
[37:49.110 --> 37:50.150]  Keep going.
[37:51.150 --> 37:51.670]  Run!
[37:52.470 --> 37:53.530]  He slit my back.
[37:55.350 --> 37:56.390]  Oh shit!
[37:57.210 --> 37:58.650]  He jumped on my head.
[37:59.350 --> 38:00.310]  I got you.
[38:01.870 --> 38:02.370]  Alright.
[38:04.110 --> 38:04.850]  Keep moving.
[38:05.050 --> 38:05.610]  Let's go, boys.
[38:06.790 --> 38:09.370]  Night vision's on. I hear him.
[38:09.890 --> 38:10.350]  There's a pig.
[38:12.490 --> 38:13.170]  There you go.
[38:13.650 --> 38:14.050]  I hit him.
[38:16.010 --> 38:17.190]  Where is he?
[38:18.150 --> 38:19.470]  He's playing patiently.
[38:21.030 --> 38:22.010]  He is. It sucks.
[38:25.710 --> 38:27.570]  He shot me in the face!
[38:27.570 --> 38:28.950]  I got you.
[38:29.190 --> 38:30.210]  He's coming for us!
[38:32.450 --> 38:33.070]  Where'd he go?
[38:34.230 --> 38:35.110]  I think he jumped.
[38:36.550 --> 38:37.230]  I'm mudding.
[38:38.110 --> 38:38.890]  I got mud up.
[38:39.870 --> 38:40.970]  He's right around this corner.
[38:42.590 --> 38:43.330]  I just saw him.
[38:44.030 --> 38:44.550]  He's right there.
[38:45.370 --> 38:46.310]  I'll do the objective.
[38:47.250 --> 38:51.650]  If you can hit him with the up on the D-pad...
[38:51.650 --> 38:53.170]  Oh, he's on you!
[38:54.170 --> 38:55.030]  He's up in the tree.
[38:55.710 --> 38:56.690]  He just dropped to your level.
[38:57.810 --> 38:59.050]  I got mud up.
[38:59.310 --> 38:59.930]  He's coming!
[39:00.310 --> 39:02.230]  Oh, Gavin.
[39:02.630 --> 39:03.610]  Gavin, where'd you go?
[39:04.830 --> 39:05.730]  Oh, you're dead.
[39:05.850 --> 39:09.210]  I should stop talking. I'm dead.
[39:15.390 --> 39:16.610]  Watch your health.
[39:17.190 --> 39:18.550]  Let's move towards the objective.
[39:18.810 --> 39:22.070]  That alien son of a bitch just killed my best friend!
[39:23.190 --> 39:24.930]  Get your night vision on if you need it.
[39:27.230 --> 39:28.850]  What do you see, Gavin, when you're dead?
[39:30.070 --> 39:31.430]  You can watch the other perspectives.
[39:32.170 --> 39:33.190]  It's not tracking anyone, though.
[39:34.150 --> 39:34.390]  Oh.
[39:35.510 --> 39:37.470]  I think that truck is going to blow up.
[39:37.490 --> 39:39.630]  Are we supposed to blow this up?
[39:39.790 --> 39:42.550]  No, get away from it. I think there's a UAV strike coming on it.
[39:44.410 --> 39:45.390]  The one of you is alone.
[39:46.390 --> 39:47.570]  Oh, it's a pig. Fuck.
[39:47.930 --> 39:48.290]  Fuck.
[39:49.450 --> 39:49.850]  A pig!
[39:52.350 --> 39:52.870]  Pig's dead.
[39:54.250 --> 39:56.430]  Alright, UAV striking coming on that thing.
[39:56.430 --> 39:57.730]  So let's move up here.
[40:00.150 --> 40:01.330]  Wow, I missed every shot.
[40:01.910 --> 40:02.570]  Way to go, man.
[40:03.450 --> 40:06.010]  Hey, what's the help a brother up thing?
[40:06.530 --> 40:07.370]  Can we bring Gavin back?
[40:07.950 --> 40:08.410]  Oh, I don't know.
[40:09.550 --> 40:10.630]  Reinforcement mission available.
[40:11.310 --> 40:12.530]  Do it. Let's do it.
[40:12.750 --> 40:13.410]  Let's get him.
[40:14.650 --> 40:15.550]  Okay, let's go to the blue.
[40:17.950 --> 40:19.110]  Gavin, are you alive?
[40:19.550 --> 40:20.250]  No, he's not alive.
[40:21.450 --> 40:22.470]  I see his name.
[40:22.910 --> 40:23.930]  Oh, that's you. I'm sorry.
[40:23.930 --> 40:25.990]  I was looking at Geoff's name. I think it was Gavin.
[40:26.550 --> 40:27.690]  Hit a fucking wall.
[40:30.030 --> 40:30.630]  Oh, there's a wall.
[40:33.310 --> 40:34.590]  Careful, careful for Predator.
[40:34.950 --> 40:36.590]  Man, he is not struck in a little while.
[40:37.150 --> 40:38.690]  No, I think it's starting to...
[40:38.690 --> 40:39.410]  Aaron, cut left.
[40:40.490 --> 40:42.170]  I'm going right for this stuff.
[40:42.730 --> 40:44.010]  Do you think he's got Predator plans?
[40:44.790 --> 40:45.410]  Yeah, probably.
[40:47.830 --> 40:49.070]  Alright, I'm getting close.
[40:49.150 --> 40:49.490]  I'm 31.
[40:51.590 --> 40:52.770]  Oh, Gavin. Oh, no.
[40:53.710 --> 40:55.090]  I'm getting him.
[40:56.150 --> 40:57.250]  Come back to life.
[40:57.470 --> 40:58.190]  Come back to life.
[40:59.230 --> 41:02.570]  I've made an unholy deal with the devil and I've brought my best friend back to life.
[41:02.610 --> 41:03.790]  And I don't care about the ramifications.
[41:04.510 --> 41:05.970]  What if he comes back as a Predator, Geoff?
[41:06.510 --> 41:07.230]  And I read it.
[41:07.650 --> 41:08.650]  What if he comes back as a Predator?
[41:10.110 --> 41:11.550]  That would be pretty fucking ironic.
[41:13.610 --> 41:16.570]  Oh, the finest plot twist.
[41:16.570 --> 41:16.590]  Is he back?
[41:16.950 --> 41:18.430]  He's coming back in one second.
[41:19.430 --> 41:20.590]  He should be back now.
[41:21.570 --> 41:22.370]  Geoff? Or Gavin?
[41:22.750 --> 41:23.450]  Are you with us?
[41:27.710 --> 41:29.410]  How'd you get here? We didn't even carry your body.
[41:29.910 --> 41:30.310]  I had a bad dream.
[41:30.310 --> 41:31.510]  What was it like on the other side?
[41:31.650 --> 41:34.730]  Why can't I move? Have you cemented my feet to the ground?
[41:34.970 --> 41:35.610]  Am I in a...
[41:37.050 --> 41:37.390]  Oh!
[41:38.810 --> 41:39.670]  I killed you!
[41:42.230 --> 41:43.410]  He's up there somewhere.
[41:44.090 --> 41:46.110]  He only cares about killing Gavin.
[41:46.250 --> 41:48.610]  You resurrected me in glue, you bastard.
[41:49.590 --> 41:50.030]  What?
[41:51.450 --> 41:52.610]  There he goes!
[41:53.450 --> 41:55.070]  I can walk! No, I can't!
[41:55.270 --> 41:56.170]  I can't move!
[41:57.170 --> 41:59.190]  I can't move, he stunned me!
[41:59.810 --> 42:01.390]  Oh, he's aiming right at you!
[42:03.490 --> 42:04.910]  What have you done to me?
[42:05.470 --> 42:07.730]  Here, let me get you up. Maybe you can move after that.
[42:07.750 --> 42:08.410]  He's shooting us!
[42:12.430 --> 42:13.970]  You son of a bitch!
[42:16.570 --> 42:17.010]  No!
[42:20.110 --> 42:21.230]  Help me, please!
[42:21.230 --> 42:22.190]  I can't move!
[42:23.530 --> 42:23.950]  Move!
[42:25.530 --> 42:26.390]  Push me!
[42:26.630 --> 42:27.850]  Push me into the building!
[42:29.710 --> 42:31.090]  He's on us!
[42:33.190 --> 42:34.150]  He's gonna blow!
[42:34.490 --> 42:35.150]  We gotta get out of here!
[42:38.260 --> 42:39.180]  I hope I downed someone.
[42:39.180 --> 42:40.320]  We gotta get out of here!
[42:41.600 --> 42:43.840]  Run, Gavin!
[42:44.420 --> 42:45.860]  Why was I brought back just...
[42:45.860 --> 42:48.580]  Why was I brought back just to die?
[42:48.580 --> 42:52.480]  You gave me lit boots, you bastards!
[42:56.360 --> 42:57.780]  Gavin's been killed!
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.640]  Why was I programmed to feel pain?
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.520]  What the hell happened?
[43:10.900 --> 43:16.080]  Wait, Andrew, we brought Gavin back to life and he could not move.
[43:16.460 --> 43:17.840]  That's so funny.
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.340]  He's cemented to the ground and so it's us trying to scramble and help him.
[43:22.500 --> 43:25.260]  And then you blasting us.
[43:30.380 --> 43:32.220]  Holy shit, that was funny.
[43:34.360 --> 43:36.160]  I killed Gavin twice.
[43:36.440 --> 43:38.020]  That was fucking great, man.
[43:38.140 --> 43:42.400]  It seemed like you only cared about killing Gavin.
[43:42.420 --> 43:44.440]  No, I'm still figuring out how to tell who's who.
[43:46.380 --> 43:47.560]  That was so funny.
[43:47.720 --> 43:49.140]  God, that's so fucking funny.
[43:49.440 --> 43:50.800]  I don't know how to top that.
[43:50.900 --> 43:53.080]  That was about as fucking hard as I've laughed in a while.
[43:53.160 --> 43:54.760]  We gotta play this game.
[43:54.920 --> 43:56.120]  We gotta play this game again.
[43:56.280 --> 43:59.820]  Andrew, I like that you're getting more honed in on being a predator.
[44:00.140 --> 44:00.920]  I'm gonna get you guys.
[44:01.040 --> 44:01.980]  I'm gonna get all of you guys.
[44:03.640 --> 44:08.400]  When you stopped attacking for a long time, it was all of us going,
[44:08.540 --> 44:10.780]  Oh no, oh shit, do you think he has fucking predator plans?
[44:10.940 --> 44:11.280]  Oh no.
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.980]  You cut to me and I accidentally tracked a boar thinking it was one of you.
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.840]  And then I was so lost.
[44:19.940 --> 44:22.200]  I did not have predator plans.
[44:22.760 --> 44:23.840]  Oh man.
[44:24.040 --> 44:26.180]  This predator is actually hunting a pig.
[44:26.380 --> 44:30.440]  I accidentally locked down on several pigs throughout that game.
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.780]  Dude, you were the pig-eater?
[44:32.900 --> 44:33.340]  I was the pig-eater.
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.000]  I was absolutely the pig-eater.
[44:35.820 --> 44:39.720]  The nice thing is that when we come back to play this video again,
[44:39.720 --> 44:45.300]  in the between times, everybody can level up their characters and hone in their classes.
[44:45.740 --> 44:48.280]  I immediately want to go to the lobby and start tweaking stuff.
[44:48.320 --> 44:48.860]  Yeah, me too.
[44:49.300 --> 44:51.720]  I can't wait to play this again.
[44:51.940 --> 44:53.360]  This was fucking awesome.
[44:53.680 --> 44:56.200]  Andrew, thank you for bringing this to us.
[44:56.580 --> 44:57.780]  Great game. So much fun to play.
[44:58.820 --> 44:59.740]  You know what else is fun?
[45:00.160 --> 45:05.860]  Going to Regulatrion.com or RegulationStore.com
[45:05.860 --> 45:08.420]  or even Geoff.Sucks.
[45:08.420 --> 45:10.620]  I like RegulationStore.store.
[45:10.900 --> 45:14.820]  You can also go to RegulationStore.store.
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.640]  Just go...
[45:17.340 --> 45:18.840]  Just go.
[45:19.760 --> 45:20.920]  Bye.
