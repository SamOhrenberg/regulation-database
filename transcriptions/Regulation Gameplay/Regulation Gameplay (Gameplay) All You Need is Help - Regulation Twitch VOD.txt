[00:00.000 --> 00:02.160]  Nick, you nailed those names. Look at that.
[00:02.260 --> 00:03.540]  Oh, oh, thank you.
[00:03.580 --> 00:06.640]  Dude, slightly confused about the order, but that's fine.
[00:07.740 --> 00:08.480]  Doesn't matter.
[00:09.020 --> 00:10.280]  Wait, it's an egg.
[00:11.520 --> 00:12.300]  Oh, there we go.
[00:12.520 --> 00:12.700]  That's true.
[00:13.080 --> 00:14.000]  That's, you know what?
[00:14.720 --> 00:16.960]  Gavin gives you shit about that all the time,
[00:17.020 --> 00:18.660]  and then you always come back with it's an egg,
[00:18.720 --> 00:19.800]  and there's just no response.
[00:19.940 --> 00:21.620]  You just, that's a, you win that argument at that point.
[00:21.620 --> 00:24.760]  I always feel pretty good when I take a little dump in Nick's direction,
[00:24.900 --> 00:27.200]  and then he always slaps that shit back in my face.
[00:27.600 --> 00:29.300]  He's definitely a shit slapper,
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.500]  but he does it with a smile.
[00:30.820 --> 00:33.480]  You gotta flush that down before I can get it back to you, you know?
[00:38.340 --> 00:38.980]  All right.
[00:39.260 --> 00:40.180]  Okay, I'm spinning.
[00:40.540 --> 00:42.760]  Oh, shit, I'm facing the wrong way.
[00:43.360 --> 00:44.240]  Welcome, everyone.
[00:44.400 --> 00:49.040]  We're about to be fleshy, like woolen pig Tetris blocks or something.
[00:49.200 --> 00:50.060]  What's this game called?
[00:50.060 --> 00:50.320]  I think that's it.
[00:50.780 --> 00:51.720]  All you need is help.
[00:53.840 --> 00:55.700]  I think you have to play it for players.
[00:56.440 --> 00:56.840]  Okay.
[00:58.100 --> 00:59.460]  All right, so you hit it.
[00:59.500 --> 01:00.340]  Oh, here we go.
[01:01.820 --> 01:02.720]  Oh, God.
[01:02.960 --> 01:03.420]  Next stage.
[01:03.660 --> 01:04.560]  Oh, shit, it's random.
[01:05.360 --> 01:06.440]  Whoa, whoa.
[01:06.580 --> 01:07.780]  Oh, okay.
[01:08.960 --> 01:10.220]  Uh, I hit the buttons, I guess.
[01:10.300 --> 01:11.440]  Move the wood.
[01:12.400 --> 01:13.080]  Hey, that's me.
[01:13.640 --> 01:14.200]  Hey, that's Gavin.
[01:14.260 --> 01:15.840]  Oh, shit, look at my extra shit.
[01:16.460 --> 01:17.900]  Gavin's an alpha loser.
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.360]  It is named-
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.400]  Ah, I got everything.
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.560]  I got a hat.
[01:22.600 --> 01:23.380]  I got arms.
[01:23.420 --> 01:24.200]  I got a leg.
[01:24.920 --> 01:25.960]  I'm a C for cunt.
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.180]  What am I?
[01:30.940 --> 01:31.920]  Uh, you're a period.
[01:32.700 --> 01:32.980]  What?
[01:33.160 --> 01:33.320]  Wait.
[01:34.340 --> 01:35.280]  I'm just me?
[01:35.720 --> 01:36.360]  Yeah, you're just a period.
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.040]  Nigger, this is you.
[01:37.380 --> 01:37.560]  Okay.
[01:37.660 --> 01:38.340]  You got nothing?
[01:38.560 --> 01:39.260]  We got five minutes.
[01:40.000 --> 01:40.780]  All right, I'll do this.
[01:40.780 --> 01:40.940]  Where do we-
[01:42.820 --> 01:43.900]  Uh, I need to spin-
[01:43.900 --> 01:44.360]  Hey, no, no, no.
[01:44.420 --> 01:44.840]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:44.840 --> 01:45.560]  Here, let me see.
[01:45.660 --> 01:47.660]  I can knock out three of these if you get out of my way.
[01:47.900 --> 01:48.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48.160 --> 01:48.580]  And then Nick-
[01:48.580 --> 01:49.220]  I'm trying to move.
[01:49.220 --> 01:49.480]  Or period.
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.620]  And then the period.
[01:52.060 --> 01:53.340]  The cunt and the period can do this.
[01:53.420 --> 01:53.800]  All right, here we go.
[01:55.420 --> 01:56.080]  You go down.
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.200]  Oh, wait, I gotta spin.
[01:57.440 --> 01:57.800]  I gotta spin.
[01:57.800 --> 01:59.720]  I think I'm getting it, though.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.800]  How do I-
[02:01.800 --> 02:01.860]  Nick!
[02:01.880 --> 02:03.800]  Maybe you'll lock into place when you press A.
[02:04.360 --> 02:04.760]  Yeah.
[02:04.960 --> 02:05.620]  Oh, look at that.
[02:07.880 --> 02:08.280]  Nice.
[02:08.820 --> 02:10.860]  God, I wanna punch this music in the face.
[02:10.860 --> 02:10.980]  Oh, no. Andrew!
[02:11.980 --> 02:13.160]  Oh, Andrew's useless.
[02:13.700 --> 02:14.160]  I'm trying-
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.300]  Oh, it turns out he's in the wrong shape for that.
[02:16.600 --> 02:19.420]  Yeah, well, then maybe you should come down here and do this one.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.200]  Yeah.
[02:22.020 --> 02:22.420]  Yeah.
[02:22.540 --> 02:24.580]  Yeah, well, you're in the wrong hole, bro.
[02:25.160 --> 02:25.900]  All right, chill out.
[02:26.000 --> 02:26.380]  Chill your bean.
[02:26.640 --> 02:27.440]  Let me-
[02:27.440 --> 02:29.100]  So, I'm excited.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.100]  Oh, we're fucked.
[02:30.180 --> 02:31.280]  Oh, come on.
[02:31.320 --> 02:32.500]  All right, all right.
[02:32.560 --> 02:34.060]  There we go. There we go. There we go. I'm in.
[02:34.220 --> 02:34.400]  I'm in.
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.020]  Ram at home. Let's go.
[02:36.200 --> 02:37.300]  No time to chill yet.
[02:37.540 --> 02:38.120]  Okay, 60 seconds.
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.780]  Oh, it's not over. It's not over.
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.600]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:42.020 --> 02:42.960]  I gotta use these coins.
[02:43.600 --> 02:44.160]  Get the coins.
[02:44.320 --> 02:45.520]  Get the coins.
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.060]  I'll get the coins.
[02:47.220 --> 02:48.200]  You guys get in position.
[02:50.180 --> 02:50.940]  Yeah, Nick.
[02:51.080 --> 02:52.200]  I think-
[02:52.200 --> 02:53.480]  What did Nick just say?
[02:53.800 --> 02:54.120]  I don't know.
[02:54.200 --> 02:54.480]  I'm gonna sit here.
[02:54.480 --> 02:54.880]  I'm gonna sit in the corner.
[02:55.200 --> 02:56.660]  Why don't you two figure that out?
[02:56.660 --> 02:58.180]  I'll get in the gap that you leave.
[02:58.180 --> 02:59.780]  No, we-
[03:00.360 --> 03:03.000]  Well, that's definitely not correct.
[03:03.340 --> 03:05.020]  I think that's probably-
[03:05.020 --> 03:06.540]  Geoff needs to figure himself out.
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.580]  Why don't you be the top, Geoff?
[03:07.660 --> 03:08.520]  The top, yeah, exactly like that.
[03:08.520 --> 03:09.380]  I don't think that-
[03:09.380 --> 03:10.200]  Okay, I'll be the top.
[03:10.360 --> 03:10.740]  On the top.
[03:11.000 --> 03:11.200]  Okay.
[03:11.720 --> 03:11.920]  Okay.
[03:12.060 --> 03:12.900]  Don't you ever forget it, too.
[03:13.180 --> 03:13.840]  Gavin's the bottom.
[03:14.040 --> 03:14.760]  All right, now you go, Gavin.
[03:14.780 --> 03:15.920]  We did it. We did it. We did it.
[03:15.960 --> 03:16.860]  We got it. We got it. We got it.
[03:17.120 --> 03:17.720]  Fuckin'-
[03:17.720 --> 03:18.900]  Nick, what are you doing?
[03:19.040 --> 03:19.560]  You shrank.
[03:19.860 --> 03:20.080]  Stop.
[03:24.560 --> 03:26.220]  I got gunshot. I got gunshot.
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.200]  Who said 60 seconds?
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.740]  Didn't we have, like, five minutes for all that?
[03:30.020 --> 03:31.220]  Yeah, it added 60 seconds.
[03:31.220 --> 03:32.240]  It added 60 seconds, yeah.
[03:32.260 --> 03:33.100]  Somebody said Andrew's-
[03:33.100 --> 03:35.000]  It made it sound like we were out of time.
[03:36.460 --> 03:37.580]  I'll lower myself.
[03:40.020 --> 03:41.600]  Take the power out of Nick's hands.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.980]  I like that when someone's loud,
[03:44.060 --> 03:46.200]  you always go to your own mixer first.
[03:46.500 --> 03:49.760]  Okay, I'm turning myself back up to where I was.
[03:50.040 --> 03:50.740]  No, it's too much.
[03:50.800 --> 03:51.800]  You've overshooted it now.
[03:51.820 --> 03:52.740]  Too much, too much.
[03:52.760 --> 03:54.280]  Okay, now I'm turning myself down.
[03:54.480 --> 03:55.200]  Jesus Christ.
[03:55.840 --> 03:56.060]  All right.
[03:57.580 --> 03:58.300]  All right.
[03:58.860 --> 04:02.140]  If you change your own mixer, you change it on the recording.
[04:02.760 --> 04:03.340]  That's true.
[04:04.120 --> 04:04.400]  Recording.
[04:05.020 --> 04:05.380]  Recording.
[04:06.240 --> 04:07.160]  I won't touch it.
[04:07.200 --> 04:08.880]  I assume you're only too loud for the stream.
[04:09.060 --> 04:09.240]  All right.
[04:09.580 --> 04:10.480]  I want to be the E.
[04:10.760 --> 04:11.680]  Oh, shit, I'm the A.
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.260]  I'll turn my hair down a hair.
[04:16.380 --> 04:16.880]  There we go.
[04:17.500 --> 04:19.740]  You look like a crown, kind of.
[04:20.380 --> 04:21.460]  Turn Geoff up a hair.
[04:21.660 --> 04:22.620]  Oh, you got-
[04:22.620 --> 04:22.980]  I'm an L.
[04:23.200 --> 04:23.760]  I'm the big-
[04:23.760 --> 04:24.660]  I'm a capital loser.
[04:25.540 --> 04:26.360]  Too big of a hair.
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.840]  I was hoping so much Nick would just be a dot again.
[04:28.840 --> 04:29.640]  Holy shit.
[04:30.780 --> 04:31.520]  On the P.
[04:32.520 --> 04:32.840]  Okay.
[04:33.420 --> 04:35.000]  All right, we gotta spin ourselves around.
[04:35.340 --> 04:36.400]  Oh, I'm slow.
[04:37.180 --> 04:38.040]  I'm weighty now.
[04:38.300 --> 04:39.580]  Remember, you can run.
[04:39.980 --> 04:40.600]  How do you run?
[04:41.200 --> 04:41.500]  A, right?
[04:41.500 --> 04:42.040]  You hold A.
[04:42.260 --> 04:42.820]  Oh, you hold A.
[04:42.940 --> 04:44.220]  Oh, god, you can go off the ledge.
[04:44.880 --> 04:45.520]  Don't do that, though.
[04:46.820 --> 04:47.280]  I'm in.
[04:49.340 --> 04:50.900]  All right, L, as soon as you're in position, I'm in.
[04:50.940 --> 04:52.760]  Oh, shit, I gotta spin.
[04:56.480 --> 04:56.840]  Andrew.
[04:58.880 --> 05:01.100]  Oh, no.
[05:01.460 --> 05:02.120]  Oh, no.
[05:02.620 --> 05:03.120]  Oh, no.
[05:03.120 --> 05:03.240]  Oh, no.
[05:03.320 --> 05:03.560]  It's perfect.
[05:03.880 --> 05:04.340]  It's perfect.
[05:04.600 --> 05:04.980]  Wait, wait, wait.
[05:04.980 --> 05:05.200]  This is great.
[05:05.320 --> 05:05.660]  You're great.
[05:05.800 --> 05:06.060]  You're great.
[05:06.140 --> 05:06.780]  Wait, wait.
[05:07.520 --> 05:07.880]  Reverse.
[05:08.060 --> 05:08.380]  Yeah, you're great.
[05:08.700 --> 05:09.060]  Reverse.
[05:09.180 --> 05:09.880]  Three point-
[05:09.880 --> 05:10.180]  Oh, no!
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.560]  Oh, shit.
[05:13.500 --> 05:13.900]  We're gonna-
[05:13.900 --> 05:14.260]  You got it.
[05:14.280 --> 05:14.840]  We're gonna have to get up probably.
[05:14.840 --> 05:15.380]  Oh, oh, oh.
[05:15.380 --> 05:16.920]  No, he's got it.
[05:16.920 --> 05:17.760]  Come on, come on.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.820]  He's got it.
[05:18.920 --> 05:19.400]  Look at that.
[05:19.940 --> 05:20.300]  Shimmy.
[05:20.480 --> 05:22.000]  This is for babies.
[05:23.080 --> 05:23.320]  Shimmy.
[05:24.020 --> 05:24.820]  There we go.
[05:25.620 --> 05:25.980]  I might be able to-
[05:25.980 --> 05:26.560]  Fuck yeah!
[05:26.840 --> 05:27.180]  World record.
[05:27.520 --> 05:27.880]  Achievement.
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.420]  Whoa, achievement.
[05:29.780 --> 05:30.980]  Oh, somebody said congrats, Gavin.
[05:31.060 --> 05:32.700]  They thought you did very well on that stage.
[05:33.100 --> 05:34.660]  A lot of people think you did well today.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.040]  I'm giving Gavin some hearts.
[05:38.540 --> 05:42.220]  People give a lot of people giving Meg credit for your performance in this game.
[05:42.340 --> 05:42.620]  That's weird.
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.200]  Oh, we're getting-
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.440]  Oh, this is great.
[05:47.160 --> 05:47.960]  I got loads of money.
[05:48.420 --> 05:50.320]  Dude, we're gonna buy so many fucking-
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.680]  Yeah, let me, let me, let me buy-
[05:51.680 --> 05:52.540]  I can buy a new thing.
[05:52.620 --> 05:53.440]  Let me buy a new thing.
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.640]  Oh, we're gonna buy cash?
[05:55.140 --> 05:55.380]  Yeah.
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.380]  I can't.
[05:57.960 --> 05:59.540]  I'm gonna get a fabric ball.
[05:59.740 --> 06:01.020]  Oh, I got a skin.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.320]  Oh, I got a-
[06:02.480 --> 06:04.240]  I don't have to be a fleshy guts.
[06:06.260 --> 06:08.920]  I got two hearts on my stamp card.
[06:09.500 --> 06:10.720]  All right, how do I change my skin?
[06:11.960 --> 06:13.840]  How do I change my skin?
[06:14.540 --> 06:17.440]  How do I change my skin?
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.040]  Oh, I see.
[06:20.140 --> 06:20.380]  X.
[06:21.540 --> 06:22.580]  Mazily monster.
[06:22.960 --> 06:25.480]  Hey, well, I'm currently red chick.
[06:25.480 --> 06:26.680]  I got a new nickname.
[06:26.820 --> 06:27.820]  Oh, yeah.
[06:27.940 --> 06:28.800]  Let me adjust.
[06:29.580 --> 06:31.720]  How do you go back to your home?
[06:31.960 --> 06:32.980]  Oh, yeah, I'm monster.
[06:33.260 --> 06:34.160]  My home?
[06:34.300 --> 06:34.400]  Yeah.
[06:34.440 --> 06:35.060]  Oh, I have a home.
[06:35.420 --> 06:35.640]  Yeah.
[06:36.360 --> 06:37.160]  Nick, you have a home.
[06:37.360 --> 06:37.680]  Finally.
[06:37.980 --> 06:39.260]  Oh my god, I did it.
[06:40.620 --> 06:42.360]  Crying genius, which I'm okay with.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.280]  I'm camouflaged now.
[06:44.700 --> 06:45.500]  I have a camel skin.
[06:46.000 --> 06:46.760]  You're so sneaky.
[06:52.140 --> 06:54.100]  Geoff needs Thuman's hot dogs.
[06:54.810 --> 06:56.180]  Yeah, give me that dude's hot dogs.
[06:56.480 --> 06:58.120]  Why does he get to have them all?
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.480]  I'm a nasally pig.
[07:01.620 --> 07:05.440]  Oh, that's a great unlock.
[07:06.360 --> 07:06.800]  Yeah.
[07:09.240 --> 07:09.780]  Okay.
[07:14.550 --> 07:16.230]  Red Kappa coming over.
[07:19.410 --> 07:20.370]  Here we go.
[07:21.530 --> 07:22.750]  Oh, this one looks serious.
[07:23.710 --> 07:25.150]  We got a lot of buttoners.
[07:25.750 --> 07:26.950]  Bridges and stuff too.
[07:27.690 --> 07:28.510]  Over there.
[07:30.450 --> 07:31.350]  I'm an L.
[07:32.690 --> 07:33.150]  Nice.
[07:35.110 --> 07:35.570]  Nice.
[07:35.870 --> 07:36.590]  Oh, shit.
[07:37.190 --> 07:38.510]  I'm a little L, actually.
[07:39.990 --> 07:41.170]  You forgot you weren't Gavin?
[07:41.350 --> 07:42.070]  I forgot who I was.
[07:45.070 --> 07:46.690]  Oh, we're all grouped up.
[07:47.110 --> 07:49.410]  If I flip over, I'll be like a little cock and balls.
[07:49.410 --> 07:50.510]  Is it?
[07:55.850 --> 07:57.350]  How do we...
[07:57.350 --> 07:57.930]  All right, there you go.
[07:57.990 --> 07:58.310]  There you go.
[07:58.430 --> 07:58.850]  There you go.
[07:58.930 --> 07:59.530]  Nailed it.
[08:00.550 --> 08:01.270]  Oh, shit.
[08:01.930 --> 08:03.450]  Oh, no, stop it.
[08:03.710 --> 08:04.350]  I think so.
[08:06.150 --> 08:07.550]  We need some woolidge.
[08:08.210 --> 08:08.850]  All right, hold on.
[08:09.130 --> 08:09.610]  We'll do it.
[08:09.630 --> 08:10.370]  You guys catch it.
[08:11.050 --> 08:12.050]  Gavin, group up.
[08:15.350 --> 08:15.710]  Okay.
[08:16.470 --> 08:17.830]  Dear God, just sit down on it.
[08:18.010 --> 08:18.310]  Oh, it's not.
[08:20.590 --> 08:21.470]  That's a...
[08:21.470 --> 08:22.750]  That's an unfortunate phrase.
[08:24.250 --> 08:24.970]  Oh, all right.
[08:25.110 --> 08:26.150]  Put the ball in the hole.
[08:26.390 --> 08:26.890]  Slide it.
[08:28.410 --> 08:28.850]  Oh.
[08:30.590 --> 08:32.150]  He needs to be saved.
[08:32.310 --> 08:32.790]  Look at that.
[08:33.410 --> 08:33.730]  He needs...
[08:33.730 --> 08:34.490]  Oh, hell yeah.
[08:34.610 --> 08:34.830]  Okay.
[08:36.390 --> 08:37.990]  Make sure we get these loose coins.
[08:38.950 --> 08:40.410]  All right, I'll go in the bottom corner.
[08:41.170 --> 08:42.210]  What makes the coins loose?
[08:42.310 --> 08:42.870]  Just get the coin.
[08:44.570 --> 08:45.010]  Uh.
[08:46.090 --> 08:46.410]  That's it.
[08:46.890 --> 08:48.010]  I need to spinny-do.
[08:48.010 --> 08:49.390]  And then, Geoff.
[08:50.170 --> 08:51.410]  Yeah, I just need to spin around.
[08:53.010 --> 08:54.490]  The starting positions.
[08:55.830 --> 08:55.930]  Yeah.
[08:57.130 --> 08:58.290]  I seem to be stuck.
[08:58.930 --> 08:59.850]  What's Yellow doing?
[09:00.050 --> 09:00.870]  Nick, what are you playing at?
[09:01.350 --> 09:02.110]  I'm stuck.
[09:02.890 --> 09:03.770]  Why are you going over there?
[09:04.410 --> 09:05.210]  I'm stuck.
[09:06.110 --> 09:07.630]  You're the opposite of me.
[09:08.010 --> 09:09.390]  Be the opposite of me on the other side.
[09:09.610 --> 09:10.430]  I need to move.
[09:10.690 --> 09:12.170]  I'm trying to move.
[09:12.290 --> 09:13.710]  My character is stuck.
[09:13.990 --> 09:15.250]  Why did you even come over here?
[09:15.250 --> 09:18.510]  What are you doing over here, Nick?
[09:18.650 --> 09:19.710]  That's not your world.
[09:19.870 --> 09:20.430]  Hold on, hold on.
[09:20.510 --> 09:20.850]  I can do it.
[09:20.890 --> 09:21.530]  I can do it.
[09:21.550 --> 09:21.910]  I can do it.
[09:21.930 --> 09:22.390]  I can do it.
[09:22.410 --> 09:22.990]  I can do it.
[09:23.030 --> 09:23.470]  I can do it.
[09:23.470 --> 09:23.770]  I can do it.
[09:23.810 --> 09:24.910]  We don't have to get up now.
[09:25.030 --> 09:25.930]  We're gonna have to move.
[09:26.230 --> 09:26.950]  I'm sleeping.
[09:27.170 --> 09:28.730]  Look at how cozy I am.
[09:28.750 --> 09:29.270]  Oh, you know what?
[09:29.610 --> 09:31.170]  Let Nick get back to the microphone.
[09:31.450 --> 09:31.990]  Yeah, I did it.
[09:32.030 --> 09:32.390]  I'm free.
[09:36.420 --> 09:37.180]  There we go.
[09:37.240 --> 09:37.700]  Hey, Nick.
[09:37.760 --> 09:38.280]  Great job.
[09:40.420 --> 09:41.420]  Never a doubt.
[09:41.740 --> 09:45.160]  We spent more time trying to get Nick out of the corner than doing anything else.
[09:45.360 --> 09:46.740]  Well, I got stuck in the corner.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.280]  I'm gonna give Nick some love because of that.
[09:51.120 --> 09:53.620]  I gave Geoff and Andrew some hearts.
[09:53.820 --> 09:54.900]  Oh my god.
[09:55.720 --> 09:56.340]  I didn't.
[09:56.440 --> 09:57.240]  I wasn't paying attention.
[09:57.520 --> 09:58.100]  I didn't know you could do that.
[09:59.340 --> 10:00.420]  I'll start doing it now.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.300]  I think I was trying.
[10:03.400 --> 10:04.700]  I don't think I gave any to Nick.
[10:04.760 --> 10:05.460]  I was trying to though.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.600]  Still figuring out the hard ones.
[10:07.600 --> 10:08.700]  You sure didn't give any to me.
[10:10.040 --> 10:10.800]  Well, you deserved them.
[10:10.860 --> 10:11.180]  I'm sorry.
[10:12.120 --> 10:14.060]  Uh, probably not, honestly.
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.160]  Does he remember which ones we played or?
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.120]  I hope so.
[10:18.620 --> 10:19.500]  Uh, yeah.
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.180]  I think I said yeah.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.060]  Good idea.
[10:22.240 --> 10:22.640]  Yeah.
[10:23.220 --> 10:24.700]  What am I gonna be?
[10:31.200 --> 10:33.200]  Frost1990, thanks for the gifted sub.
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.060]  Oh, thank you.
[10:34.120 --> 10:35.480]  And the level nine hype train.
[10:35.640 --> 10:36.080]  That's crazy.
[10:36.260 --> 10:36.820]  Thank you so much.
[10:40.250 --> 10:40.690]  And...
[10:40.690 --> 10:42.690]  Oh no, you're a Z.
[10:43.370 --> 10:45.170]  Oh, the worst thing I could possibly be.
[10:45.370 --> 10:47.050]  Where shall I put my fleshy penis?
[10:47.530 --> 10:49.050]  We gotta roll the ball into the hole.
[10:49.750 --> 10:50.570]  I'm grabbing the coins.
[10:52.050 --> 10:53.270]  Where does the ball go?
[10:54.170 --> 10:55.010]  Are we the well?
[10:56.890 --> 10:57.890]  Do I just go in?
[10:59.070 --> 10:59.830]  No, I don't think you can.
[10:59.910 --> 11:01.150]  The ball will drop down the ramp.
[11:01.310 --> 11:02.070]  There's a button.
[11:02.130 --> 11:04.070]  Go get the ball up here, probably.
[11:04.550 --> 11:04.690]  Yeah.
[11:04.970 --> 11:05.330]  Guys.
[11:06.350 --> 11:07.470]  I just wanna...
[11:07.470 --> 11:07.610]  Nick.
[11:07.910 --> 11:08.610]  Hold on, I got it.
[11:08.830 --> 11:09.530]  I got it. It's okay.
[11:10.190 --> 11:10.850]  Is it okay?
[11:11.070 --> 11:11.190]  Okay.
[11:11.370 --> 11:12.090]  No, you know what?
[11:12.430 --> 11:13.630]  You know what? No, I don't have it.
[11:14.410 --> 11:16.410]  Nick, are you all right?
[11:16.950 --> 11:17.930]  I don't know.
[11:17.930 --> 11:18.630]  Here comes the ball.
[11:20.230 --> 11:21.290]  I don't know.
[11:22.890 --> 11:24.250]  Wait, I could be a good...
[11:24.250 --> 11:24.430]  Oops.
[11:24.850 --> 11:26.510]  I could be a good edge piece.
[11:26.690 --> 11:27.510]  Yeah, good edge.
[11:28.590 --> 11:29.430]  There we go.
[11:29.570 --> 11:30.070]  There we go.
[11:30.150 --> 11:30.510]  Doing good.
[11:31.190 --> 11:32.190]  I just push it straight.
[11:32.950 --> 11:33.930]  There we go.
[11:34.470 --> 11:35.210]  We got this.
[11:35.350 --> 11:36.070]  We got this.
[11:36.070 --> 11:37.730]  Oh, so much speed, boys.
[11:38.010 --> 11:38.570]  Big balls.
[11:39.790 --> 11:39.930]  Yes.
[11:40.990 --> 11:42.810]  We got it.
[11:43.910 --> 11:45.830]  Okay, now what's the sitch?
[11:49.490 --> 11:50.090]  Oh, okay.
[11:51.610 --> 11:53.790]  I think you're gonna need to stand up for a second there.
[11:53.890 --> 11:54.890]  Yeah, there you go.
[11:55.050 --> 11:55.170]  Oh.
[11:55.270 --> 11:56.530]  How do I spin around?
[12:00.130 --> 12:00.770]  Geoff, you...
[12:01.510 --> 12:02.690]  Nick, you're on the left, right?
[12:03.390 --> 12:04.450]  Yeah, I will be.
[12:05.770 --> 12:07.770]  Well, Geoff, you might need to spin and...
[12:07.770 --> 12:08.410]  Oh, Nick.
[12:08.750 --> 12:09.390]  There you go.
[12:09.750 --> 12:11.390]  I'll wait until other people are...
[12:12.690 --> 12:13.370]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[12:13.430 --> 12:14.250]  I can't move.
[12:14.410 --> 12:14.950]  All right, there we go.
[12:15.210 --> 12:16.310]  How the hell did you do that?
[12:18.370 --> 12:19.030]  I'm a little...
[12:21.790 --> 12:23.090]  So, I'm gonna want that...
[12:23.710 --> 12:24.750]  I'm gonna want to try that...
[12:25.450 --> 12:27.030]  Ethernet cable you were talking about.
[12:29.430 --> 12:30.450]  Where do I go?
[12:30.710 --> 12:31.690]  What position should I be in?
[12:31.690 --> 12:32.710]  I think you're just at the bottom.
[12:32.810 --> 12:33.910]  I think you're just the bottom four.
[12:34.510 --> 12:35.190]  Oh, me?
[12:35.910 --> 12:36.390]  I think so.
[12:36.810 --> 12:37.210]  I'm three.
[12:38.250 --> 12:39.430]  The three people green.
[12:39.430 --> 12:40.570]  Nick, why don't you put yourself where you...
[12:41.110 --> 12:41.390]  Oh.
[12:41.430 --> 12:43.010]  Well, I'll be in his way if I do, though.
[12:43.010 --> 12:44.290]  Yeah, Geoff, move to the middle.
[12:44.910 --> 12:45.150]  Okay.
[12:45.270 --> 12:45.450]  There you go.
[12:45.490 --> 12:45.990]  See, like that.
[12:46.870 --> 12:48.450]  And then, Nick, go there.
[12:49.470 --> 12:49.830]  Yeah.
[12:50.170 --> 12:50.430]  Yeah.
[12:50.730 --> 12:51.250]  All right.
[12:51.550 --> 12:51.710]  Yeah.
[12:52.030 --> 12:52.330]  Okay.
[12:55.620 --> 12:57.440]  No, Geoff, you just spin.
[12:57.700 --> 12:58.840]  Oh, God, what are you doing?
[12:59.240 --> 13:00.020]  He's trying to spin.
[13:00.180 --> 13:00.920]  He's trying to spin.
[13:01.020 --> 13:02.800]  He's rubbing up against you to spin.
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.460]  Oh, God.
[13:04.680 --> 13:05.040]  There we go.
[13:05.300 --> 13:05.620]  Let Gavin...
[13:05.620 --> 13:06.720]  Maybe let Gavin get...
[13:06.720 --> 13:07.120]  Well, nope.
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.100]  That's not gonna work, is he?
[13:08.280 --> 13:08.420]  Gavin!
[13:12.040 --> 13:13.640]  There, now Gavin can't be moved.
[13:15.360 --> 13:15.540]  Oops.
[13:15.680 --> 13:15.980]  There we...
[13:15.980 --> 13:16.760]  Oh, that's a game.
[13:18.660 --> 13:19.340]  It's cheesy.
[13:19.860 --> 13:20.980]  We look like a shroom.
[13:23.540 --> 13:23.880]  Okay.
[13:24.200 --> 13:24.720]  Putting to Nick.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.660]  Does Geoff not understand the game?
[13:26.760 --> 13:27.200]  Do you?
[13:27.540 --> 13:28.220]  Oh, I gotta hit X.
[13:28.340 --> 13:28.860]  Okay, I see.
[13:29.460 --> 13:30.560]  It's X, Y, B, A.
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.900]  MKNUDSTRUP, thanks for the 10 gifted subs, by the looks of it.
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.060]  Oh, thank you so much.
[13:37.320 --> 13:37.880]  Oh, dang it.
[13:38.000 --> 13:38.620]  Got more coins.
[13:38.720 --> 13:39.880]  I gotta go buy another thing.
[13:44.960 --> 13:45.640]  All right.
[13:46.640 --> 13:47.300]  Oh, are you shopping?
[13:47.460 --> 13:48.760]  We're shopping every two levels.
[13:48.980 --> 13:50.460]  I'm shopping every time I got enough points.
[13:50.540 --> 13:51.160]  I could shop.
[13:54.100 --> 13:54.900]  Ribbon green.
[13:55.160 --> 13:57.680]  I wonder if I have enough coins to buy an ethernet cable.
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.160]  Oh, a bunny bow pink.
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.380]  The way you said that made it sound like you did.
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.880]  I don't know if I see myself as a bunny bow pink kind of cube.
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.100]  I'm gonna go over here.
[14:11.140 --> 14:12.480]  Why did I get a ribbon that's green?
[14:12.600 --> 14:13.180]  I'm not green.
[14:16.280 --> 14:17.640]  Where the X?
[14:21.340 --> 14:21.780]  Go.
[14:22.160 --> 14:23.860]  Oh, I guess it's on this one.
[14:24.020 --> 14:25.880]  Oh, I got my new skin on.
[14:28.560 --> 14:29.180]  Me too.
[14:29.380 --> 14:30.420]  How do you change skin hold?
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.520]  Go to the closet to the right.
[14:32.740 --> 14:33.500]  Oh, what the shit?
[14:34.420 --> 14:34.860]  Hello?
[14:35.900 --> 14:36.200]  Hello?
[14:36.600 --> 14:37.360]  What happened?
[14:37.420 --> 14:37.620]  Hey, wait.
[14:38.040 --> 14:38.960]  I wasn't even on the...
[14:39.880 --> 14:40.640]  Me neither.
[14:41.120 --> 14:41.540]  Okay.
[14:41.780 --> 14:43.160]  It only takes two to start it, I guess.
[14:43.630 --> 14:44.280]  I guess.
[14:44.440 --> 14:45.140]  We already did this level.
[14:46.640 --> 14:48.080]  It looks different.
[14:48.100 --> 14:48.740]  Different boxes.
[14:51.220 --> 14:51.760]  Also.
[14:53.280 --> 14:53.820]  Yeah.
[14:54.860 --> 14:56.560]  Oh, now I'm a lightning bolt.
[15:01.420 --> 15:03.800]  How do I change the voice to say nothing?
[15:05.800 --> 15:07.420]  We can do this together.
[15:08.660 --> 15:10.020]  We've done this one, haven't we?
[15:11.740 --> 15:12.760]  A version of it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:13.880]  So this looks different.
[15:13.880 --> 15:16.820]  Yeah, there's only one set of boxes in the middle last time.
[15:18.800 --> 15:20.480]  This is like the harder version.
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.020]  Yeah.
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.840]  This is inconceivable.
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.380]  Bring it back.
[15:26.720 --> 15:27.180]  I'm pushing.
[15:28.680 --> 15:30.340]  All right, let's take it up.
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.580]  All right, well, I...
[15:32.580 --> 15:33.220]  Gavin, do you want to...
[15:33.220 --> 15:35.400]  Gavin, you're in the perfect position to push up.
[15:36.700 --> 15:38.060]  I'm just a tiny little chode.
[15:38.140 --> 15:38.220]  I don't know what you want from me.
[15:38.220 --> 15:39.600]  Yeah, just be a tiny little chode.
[15:39.620 --> 15:40.100]  I'm so weak.
[15:40.580 --> 15:41.700]  Chode your way to the top.
[15:41.760 --> 15:42.740]  I got no pushing power.
[15:42.740 --> 15:45.160]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[15:45.260 --> 15:45.700]  Get in front of it.
[15:45.920 --> 15:47.600]  Green was in perfect position to save that.
[15:47.780 --> 15:48.220]  Green.
[15:48.420 --> 15:49.980]  Green's got problems.
[15:50.740 --> 15:51.260]  God damn it.
[15:51.920 --> 15:53.400]  All right, I'll deploy another one.
[15:54.000 --> 15:54.180]  Whoops.
[15:55.260 --> 15:55.820]  Damn it.
[15:56.020 --> 15:57.540]  All right, here we go.
[15:57.760 --> 15:59.380]  That's so easy on the button.
[15:59.680 --> 16:01.020]  I'll keep it right here.
[16:03.040 --> 16:03.920]  Okay, pushing.
[16:04.560 --> 16:05.240]  I'm pushing.
[16:07.500 --> 16:08.900]  All right, let's go, chode man.
[16:09.760 --> 16:11.820]  I'm goal keeping the right side.
[16:11.820 --> 16:14.840]  I feel like Mick was, but okay.
[16:15.360 --> 16:17.380]  Well, I had the north part.
[16:17.560 --> 16:18.100]  Hook it up, blue.
[16:18.440 --> 16:18.940]  Oh, no.
[16:19.660 --> 16:20.700]  It's all on you.
[16:21.720 --> 16:23.120]  I can't, I'm not under it.
[16:23.280 --> 16:23.940]  There we go.
[16:24.640 --> 16:25.480]  There we go.
[16:25.780 --> 16:26.700]  There we go.
[16:26.840 --> 16:27.920]  There we go.
[16:28.140 --> 16:28.960]  Pass it to yellow.
[16:30.000 --> 16:31.300]  Nope, past me.
[16:32.140 --> 16:33.880]  Oh, we had it in there.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.260]  All right, now what?
[16:38.260 --> 16:38.840]  Uh.
[16:40.500 --> 16:42.080]  I'd probably go like right here.
[16:43.380 --> 16:45.080]  And the chode goes at the bottom.
[16:46.200 --> 16:47.760]  And then you spin around.
[16:48.960 --> 16:50.800]  Yeah, you do a 45 degrees.
[16:51.000 --> 16:51.720]  And then you do that.
[16:51.780 --> 16:52.260]  And then we're good.
[16:53.980 --> 16:54.780]  45 degrees.
[16:55.280 --> 16:55.720]  There we go.
[16:56.940 --> 16:57.540]  Hold on.
[16:57.760 --> 16:58.580]  And then another 45.
[16:58.820 --> 16:59.400]  No, come on, Nick.
[16:59.400 --> 16:59.960]  You got this.
[17:00.440 --> 17:01.140]  I got it.
[17:01.180 --> 17:01.480]  Hold on.
[17:01.580 --> 17:02.740]  You got this, Nick.
[17:02.840 --> 17:03.900]  I got it.
[17:05.760 --> 17:06.560]  Easy peasy.
[17:07.320 --> 17:10.000]  We're forming so many Tetrises.
[17:10.760 --> 17:12.820]  Kicking bucket gifted subs.
[17:13.300 --> 17:15.620]  Thank you for the subs.
[17:15.920 --> 17:17.400]  You're kicking the subs, dog.
[17:18.060 --> 17:18.280]  Nice.
[17:18.680 --> 17:19.620]  Giving out subs.
[17:21.580 --> 17:23.840]  Set 50 likes to new friends.
[17:24.300 --> 17:24.860]  Oh, hell yeah.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.960]  Wow, you're really liking it.
[17:27.260 --> 17:27.520]  Achievements.
[17:27.820 --> 17:29.280]  I'm just mashing these buttons.
[17:29.520 --> 17:29.960]  It's great.
[17:30.880 --> 17:32.440]  I'm going to buy another item.
[17:32.820 --> 17:33.460]  Yeah, as am I.
[17:33.760 --> 17:34.580]  What can I get next?
[17:35.860 --> 17:37.420]  Give me a little wooly ball.
[17:37.640 --> 17:39.120]  Oh, looks like a maxi pad.
[17:39.300 --> 17:40.700]  Oh, footprints blue.
[17:41.680 --> 17:42.920]  Little maxi pad.
[17:42.920 --> 17:43.140]  Explored.
[17:46.820 --> 17:48.720]  Just need one more stamp.
[17:49.440 --> 17:50.440]  Dude, I got furniture.
[17:51.860 --> 17:53.120]  You got furniture?
[17:53.640 --> 17:53.880]  Yeah.
[17:54.820 --> 17:56.100]  I didn't know you could get furniture.
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.480]  You jealous of shit?
[17:58.700 --> 17:59.580]  I'm so jealous.
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.380]  I'm going to change my nameplate to be...
[18:04.800 --> 18:05.880]  Puppy Prince.
[18:07.420 --> 18:09.540]  I'm changing mine to be...
[18:10.260 --> 18:11.180]  Just got an achievement.
[18:11.840 --> 18:12.520]  Congratulations.
[18:13.060 --> 18:13.720]  Thanks.
[18:14.500 --> 18:15.760]  Crying party goer.
[18:17.020 --> 18:17.980]  Here we go.
[18:19.400 --> 18:21.300]  It's your party and you will cry.
[18:24.260 --> 18:25.200]  I'm a cat.
[18:25.740 --> 18:26.440]  Oh shit.
[18:27.420 --> 18:28.140]  I'm a chican.
[18:29.220 --> 18:30.580]  Holy shit.
[18:30.700 --> 18:31.520]  You're a whole new animal?
[18:31.920 --> 18:32.260]  Whoa.
[18:32.700 --> 18:32.880]  Yeah.
[18:33.400 --> 18:33.880]  Whoa.
[18:36.360 --> 18:36.840]  What?
[18:39.340 --> 18:41.060]  I was definitely sitting, but okay.
[18:43.800 --> 18:44.900]  Hey, Tina's in here.
[18:45.000 --> 18:45.400]  What's up, Tina?
[18:46.720 --> 18:47.200]  Tina.
[18:47.740 --> 18:48.180]  Hi, Tina.
[18:48.720 --> 18:49.800]  Tina Naveas?
[18:50.440 --> 18:50.920]  Yes.
[18:51.720 --> 18:52.920]  Is there any other?
[18:53.760 --> 18:55.520]  I was trying to think of other Tinas I know.
[18:55.920 --> 18:56.080]  Turner.
[18:56.480 --> 18:56.700]  Yeah.
[18:58.700 --> 18:59.820]  I think she's dead, right?
[18:59.820 --> 19:01.300]  Gavin and Tina Turner are best friends.
[19:01.300 --> 19:03.680]  Didn't Tina Turner die with Tom Savini?
[19:04.260 --> 19:05.120]  I can't remember.
[19:06.500 --> 19:08.580]  These are future callbacks.
[19:10.220 --> 19:12.260]  These are callbacks to jokes you don't know about.
[19:13.340 --> 19:15.780]  Sad about Maggie Smith, by the way, huh?
[19:15.920 --> 19:16.200]  Yeah.
[19:16.560 --> 19:17.420]  That sucked.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.980]  Where are the switches?
[19:22.460 --> 19:25.280]  Okay, well...
[19:25.800 --> 19:26.100]  What?
[19:27.620 --> 19:28.720]  What the hell are the switches?
[19:29.020 --> 19:29.980]  Wait, wait.
[19:30.080 --> 19:30.940]  Oh, is it talking about these?
[19:31.220 --> 19:31.820]  I think so.
[19:32.800 --> 19:34.160]  Oh, we have to do that?
[19:35.660 --> 19:36.220]  Do it.
[19:37.520 --> 19:37.880]  Here?
[19:38.400 --> 19:38.580]  Okay.
[19:42.520 --> 19:43.240]  Oh, dear.
[19:44.480 --> 19:45.460]  I'll steal this one.
[19:45.580 --> 19:46.060]  Oh, help!
[19:46.180 --> 19:46.920]  So I'll sit here.
[19:47.120 --> 19:47.240]  Oh!
[19:47.480 --> 19:48.160]  Uh-oh.
[19:48.680 --> 19:49.640]  Oh, I see.
[19:49.860 --> 19:50.320]  Go back.
[19:50.480 --> 19:50.820]  Pick it up.
[19:51.180 --> 19:51.500]  Pick it up.
[19:51.760 --> 19:52.180]  In the water.
[19:52.400 --> 19:53.000]  No, no, no.
[19:53.040 --> 19:53.520]  Pick it up.
[19:53.960 --> 19:54.320]  Oh.
[19:55.380 --> 19:55.940]  There you go.
[19:56.120 --> 19:56.480]  There you go.
[19:56.580 --> 19:56.860]  No, no.
[19:56.860 --> 19:57.220]  Pick it up.
[19:57.800 --> 19:58.640]  See, now you can get it.
[20:00.460 --> 20:01.220]  Oh, wait. Hold on.
[20:02.000 --> 20:03.200]  You gotta stand on it.
[20:03.200 --> 20:04.540]  I'll stand on it.
[20:05.160 --> 20:06.020]  Who's standing on what?
[20:06.240 --> 20:06.820]  Drop that.
[20:06.820 --> 20:08.180]  I'll stand on that. You drop.
[20:08.600 --> 20:09.280]  I do this.
[20:09.280 --> 20:09.460]  There you go.
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.140]  Now don't move.
[20:10.320 --> 20:10.940]  Okay, now go.
[20:11.900 --> 20:13.040]  There you go.
[20:13.680 --> 20:13.900]  Yeah.
[20:13.900 --> 20:15.620]  You put that guy right where I am.
[20:16.020 --> 20:16.960]  Here, let me get out of the way.
[20:17.380 --> 20:17.580]  Yeah.
[20:17.740 --> 20:17.980]  There you go.
[20:18.520 --> 20:19.340]  I'll sit here.
[20:19.340 --> 20:19.600]  Hey.
[20:19.860 --> 20:20.540]  There you go.
[20:20.700 --> 20:21.140]  Okay.
[20:22.360 --> 20:24.140]  And then you guys figure that out.
[20:25.320 --> 20:26.600]  I don't think so.
[20:26.600 --> 20:27.140]  That doesn't work.
[20:27.140 --> 20:27.460]  Okay.
[20:28.840 --> 20:31.300]  Well, you probably have to leave the block.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.080]  How do I?
[20:33.880 --> 20:34.540]  There you go.
[20:34.680 --> 20:35.380]  There we go.
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.060]  How about like that?
[20:36.780 --> 20:36.960]  No.
[20:37.060 --> 20:38.500]  No, that's still not good.
[20:38.680 --> 20:45.680]  I think you need to rotate so that you go underneath it.
[20:46.360 --> 20:46.980]  No, no, no.
[20:47.100 --> 20:48.220]  Geoff, no, no.
[20:49.100 --> 20:53.220]  Geoff, flick your tail up the gap between the yellow and the thingy.
[20:53.520 --> 20:53.540]  Geoff.
[20:53.660 --> 20:53.900]  Okay.
[20:54.040 --> 20:55.060]  Flick your chain up there.
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.180]  How do I flick that tail?
[20:57.340 --> 20:57.520]  There we go.
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.080]  That's it. That's it.
[20:58.220 --> 20:58.580]  Nice.
[20:59.720 --> 21:00.860]  And then shove that up the gap.
[21:01.280 --> 21:01.300]  No.
[21:01.300 --> 21:01.840]  Oh, no.
[21:04.160 --> 21:05.800]  I wanted shove.
[21:07.360 --> 21:08.380]  Thread the needle.
[21:08.700 --> 21:09.980]  I'm trying, man.
[21:10.600 --> 21:11.800]  This needle's a cunt.
[21:12.140 --> 21:12.720]  All right, here we go.
[21:14.720 --> 21:15.680]  Get it up there.
[21:15.840 --> 21:16.520]  Get it up there.
[21:16.680 --> 21:17.210]  You got it.
[21:17.760 --> 21:18.480]  Get it up there.
[21:19.040 --> 21:20.040]  Bring it home.
[21:21.660 --> 21:23.560]  Well, I'm just facing the wrong way.
[21:23.620 --> 21:25.020]  And now it's up to Andrew.
[21:26.840 --> 21:27.300]  Shit.
[21:28.520 --> 21:28.960]  Shit.
[21:30.200 --> 21:32.060]  Just lock in one way or the other.
[21:32.480 --> 21:33.400]  One way or the other.
[21:33.660 --> 21:34.380]  What do you want from me?
[21:35.000 --> 21:35.660]  Pick one.
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.300]  You, look at you.
[21:42.080 --> 21:43.620]  What are you doing?
[21:43.980 --> 21:46.400]  I'm trying to get it to the angle.
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.200]  Oh, no.
[21:49.840 --> 21:51.020]  Oh, oh.
[21:51.180 --> 21:51.900]  It's so...
[21:51.900 --> 21:52.240]  There we go.
[21:52.240 --> 21:52.560]  There we go.
[21:52.620 --> 21:53.020]  It's...
[21:53.020 --> 21:53.420]  There we go.
[21:53.500 --> 21:53.580]  There we go.
[21:53.580 --> 21:53.840]  There we go.
[21:54.960 --> 21:55.840]  Oh, you go in there?
[21:55.920 --> 21:56.100]  Okay.
[21:56.460 --> 21:58.040]  Well, how else would he...
[21:58.040 --> 21:58.820]  I don't know, I don't know.
[21:59.700 --> 22:02.340]  Do you think he would continue to rotate after that?
[22:04.640 --> 22:07.000]  I know who's getting my likes.
[22:09.140 --> 22:10.960]  Oh, I'd like to give the shit out of Geoff.
[22:11.180 --> 22:12.400]  Well, he did all the moving.
[22:12.400 --> 22:13.260]  Holy God.
[22:13.560 --> 22:13.840]  MVP.
[22:14.320 --> 22:14.360]  Oh, my God.
[22:14.440 --> 22:15.120]  You guys are so nice.
[22:19.560 --> 22:20.680]  Look at that bunce.
[22:20.840 --> 22:21.760]  Ah, 96.
[22:22.640 --> 22:23.120]  Four away.
[22:23.620 --> 22:25.380]  Four away from the new anything.
[22:25.940 --> 22:28.160]  Thank you, the Norse Rider, for the gifted subs.
[22:28.160 --> 22:29.580]  Oh, thank you, Norse Rider.
[22:31.200 --> 22:32.960]  Best of luck on your ride.
[22:33.940 --> 22:34.100]  Yeah.
[22:39.080 --> 22:40.200]  Oh, no.
[22:40.760 --> 22:41.500]  That's a lot.
[22:42.360 --> 22:42.880]  That's a lot.
[22:43.360 --> 22:44.380]  That's a lot of stuff.
[22:44.840 --> 22:47.580]  I want to be the long, the long, fleshy...
[22:47.580 --> 22:49.920]  Oh, you're a small little guy.
[22:50.100 --> 22:51.300]  You're a crooked wiener.
[22:55.360 --> 22:57.120]  It's not enough of us for this, surely.
[22:57.680 --> 22:58.740]  Do we need to get long?
[22:58.980 --> 22:59.720]  Am I about to be...
[23:00.480 --> 23:01.840]  What do we need to get long?
[23:02.440 --> 23:02.860]  Oh, no.
[23:02.920 --> 23:03.860]  Nick's is huge.
[23:05.360 --> 23:06.720]  Holy shit, Nick.
[23:07.040 --> 23:07.520]  Wow.
[23:08.200 --> 23:12.640]  Nick's got a flip around and we've all got to survive somehow while he does.
[23:17.020 --> 23:17.500]  Uh.
[23:21.060 --> 23:21.540]  Okay.
[23:23.860 --> 23:24.340]  Nick.
[23:24.720 --> 23:25.200]  Nick.
[23:26.220 --> 23:26.800]  I got it.
[23:26.900 --> 23:27.400]  Nice turn.
[23:28.360 --> 23:29.320]  Rotating on...
[23:29.320 --> 23:30.940]  Yeah, I got to flip it the other way.
[23:31.200 --> 23:31.560]  Gavin.
[23:32.580 --> 23:34.560]  What, what, what, what do you need?
[23:35.240 --> 23:35.920]  Probably to...
[23:35.920 --> 23:35.980]  What?
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.940]  I was being the anchor.
[23:39.980 --> 23:41.020]  Yeah, you did great.
[23:43.060 --> 23:44.100]  I could do this.
[23:44.200 --> 23:44.620]  What about this?
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.300]  Are we missing anything?
[23:47.580 --> 23:48.400]  Yeah, that looks good.
[23:48.600 --> 23:49.060]  Let me spin.
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.800]  No, that doesn't work.
[23:50.920 --> 23:52.060]  I think it's got a...
[23:52.560 --> 23:53.300]  I see it.
[23:53.340 --> 23:53.740]  I see it.
[23:53.820 --> 23:54.020]  Okay.
[23:54.820 --> 23:55.780]  Blue, you're the middle.
[23:56.680 --> 23:58.200]  You go put your wiener to the sky.
[23:58.500 --> 23:59.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:59.020 --> 23:59.520]  Wiener up.
[23:59.520 --> 24:01.360]  Put your wiener to the sky.
[24:01.380 --> 24:02.760]  Oh, so I should go to where I first was.
[24:03.500 --> 24:08.480]  Yeah, and then I just need to spin around, which is easier said than done for me.
[24:08.840 --> 24:09.340]  No, it's...
[24:09.340 --> 24:10.040]  Hey, it's tough.
[24:10.220 --> 24:10.920]  You figured it out.
[24:11.140 --> 24:11.600]  Use me.
[24:11.920 --> 24:13.560]  You try and...
[24:13.560 --> 24:15.560]  It's just a fucking input.
[24:15.580 --> 24:16.460]  Yeah, now go up.
[24:16.500 --> 24:16.840]  There you go.
[24:16.840 --> 24:17.660]  There you go.
[24:18.340 --> 24:18.940]  There we go.
[24:19.600 --> 24:20.000]  Nice.
[24:21.420 --> 24:22.220]  So fast.
[24:23.280 --> 24:24.700]  We're killing this game.
[24:25.040 --> 24:26.080]  Yeah, we really, really are.
[24:26.280 --> 24:26.500]  Let's see.
[24:27.420 --> 24:28.440]  I can't get myself any.
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.040]  Thank you.
[24:32.920 --> 24:33.800]  Holy God.
[24:33.960 --> 24:35.660]  Just trying to give them all to Nick.
[24:37.200 --> 24:38.740]  Oh, that should give a lot to you.
[24:38.900 --> 24:39.880]  Back to the store.
[24:40.640 --> 24:44.300]  I thought we would be fighting more, but this is very, very smooth.
[24:44.420 --> 24:46.140]  Maybe Eric's the weak link after all.
[24:47.360 --> 24:49.400]  I think he's the angry link.
[24:49.460 --> 24:50.500]  He's definitely the absent link.
[24:51.020 --> 24:53.660]  Oh, now that I will say...
[24:53.660 --> 24:55.100]  Oh, a flower pot.
[24:55.340 --> 24:56.280]  A toilet flower pot.
[24:56.640 --> 24:57.000]  Give it.
[24:57.040 --> 24:58.020]  You guys always got flower pots.
[24:58.340 --> 24:59.180]  I filled my stamp card up.
[24:59.860 --> 25:01.720]  Dude, I get a free sub now.
[25:01.960 --> 25:02.160]  Yeah.
[25:02.460 --> 25:03.900]  Oh, I got a party hat for five stamps.
[25:03.920 --> 25:05.460]  A gift for five stamps.
[25:05.520 --> 25:06.540]  I kind of want the party hat.
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.400]  Me too. I'm going to go get the party.
[25:08.700 --> 25:09.200]  Another hat.
[25:12.960 --> 25:14.080]  Let's take a look-see.
[25:14.960 --> 25:15.360]  Oh.
[25:15.660 --> 25:19.680]  Oh, yeah.
[25:20.380 --> 25:21.020]  Oh, yeah.
[25:21.760 --> 25:22.540]  I'll be taking that.
[25:22.840 --> 25:23.080]  Thank you.
[25:23.300 --> 25:24.600]  Oh, this music is...
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.860]  No longer care about the bow tie.
[25:27.700 --> 25:28.920]  Put the turnips down.
[25:29.240 --> 25:30.920]  Where do I put my house crap?
[25:30.920 --> 25:31.920]  Put the footy goal.
[25:33.020 --> 25:34.080]  Also known as furniture.
[25:35.120 --> 25:36.520]  Dude, are you jealous of my shit?
[25:36.640 --> 25:36.700]  Look at that.
[25:36.700 --> 25:38.200]  Man, Gavin's got a full-
[25:38.200 --> 25:38.240]  How'd you do that?
[25:38.240 --> 25:39.480]  It's like fucking Animal Crossing.
[25:39.480 --> 25:40.660]  Oh, I ruined his house.
[25:40.840 --> 25:41.120]  Yeah.
[25:42.080 --> 25:42.880]  Holy shit.
[25:43.280 --> 25:45.940]  I can kick a turnip into my football goal.
[25:49.970 --> 25:50.850]  Oh, look at...
[25:50.850 --> 25:51.470]  By the window.
[25:51.910 --> 25:53.270]  Oh, I can't have glasses and a hat.
[25:53.330 --> 25:54.170]  I'm blind now.
[25:54.590 --> 25:55.590]  And then over here.
[25:56.650 --> 25:57.110]  By the window.
[25:57.150 --> 25:57.630]  Look at that.
[25:57.950 --> 25:58.470]  Oh, oh, oh, shit.
[25:58.830 --> 25:59.790]  I'm a crying detective.
[26:02.290 --> 26:03.570]  Put the fucking thing down.
[26:03.690 --> 26:04.450]  There we go.
[26:04.930 --> 26:05.350]  What do you think?
[26:05.390 --> 26:05.930]  You like my house?
[26:06.090 --> 26:06.410]  Oh, shit.
[26:06.950 --> 26:07.490]  It's great.
[26:07.810 --> 26:09.110]  Everybody's got so much stuff.
[26:10.810 --> 26:11.750]  Andrew and I are just...
[26:11.750 --> 26:12.690]  We just have room for activities.
[26:13.130 --> 26:14.830]  We just have so many names, I think.
[26:16.090 --> 26:16.930]  I got a lot of hats.
[26:17.050 --> 26:17.370]  Oh.
[26:17.570 --> 26:18.330]  Got a lot of headgear.
[26:20.370 --> 26:23.430]  Any regulation viewers getting reamed by this hurricane?
[26:24.590 --> 26:25.110]  Oh, yeah.
[26:25.230 --> 26:25.650]  That's a good question.
[26:28.050 --> 26:29.910]  Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are.
[26:31.350 --> 26:31.630]  Oh.
[26:31.630 --> 26:34.490]  That motherfucker is as big as, like, the state of Georgia.
[26:35.510 --> 26:35.950]  It's crazy.
[26:36.070 --> 26:36.930]  That's a huge storm.
[26:37.070 --> 26:37.370]  It's a Georgia storm?
[26:38.550 --> 26:38.870]  Yeah.
[26:39.310 --> 26:39.490]  Yeah.
[26:39.610 --> 26:41.290]  Well, I think now it's on its way to Tennessee, but yeah.
[26:42.170 --> 26:42.490]  Yeah.
[26:43.330 --> 26:44.270]  All right, so we just...
[26:44.270 --> 26:44.990]  The Carolinas.
[26:45.150 --> 26:46.750]  Do we just spit around?
[26:51.130 --> 26:52.030]  How do we...
[26:53.150 --> 26:54.110]  Oh, wait, I'm green.
[26:55.710 --> 26:56.610]  What were you trying to do?
[26:56.970 --> 26:57.290]  Pink.
[26:59.150 --> 26:59.970]  Oh, my...
[26:59.970 --> 27:00.750]  Excuse me.
[27:00.870 --> 27:01.610]  Coming through.
[27:01.830 --> 27:02.250]  Trying to help you.
[27:02.250 --> 27:02.910]  Coming through.
[27:03.290 --> 27:04.130]  Excuse me.
[27:04.270 --> 27:06.090]  I feel like I can help you spin if I do this.
[27:06.170 --> 27:06.910]  Excuse me.
[27:08.190 --> 27:08.490]  Oh.
[27:09.130 --> 27:10.190]  Oh, good help.
[27:11.130 --> 27:13.130]  Good rotational spinning help.
[27:15.510 --> 27:15.990]  And I...
[27:15.990 --> 27:17.430]  Can't be that rotational spinning help.
[27:17.710 --> 27:18.090]  Oh, shit.
[27:18.610 --> 27:18.830]  No!
[27:19.530 --> 27:20.090]  I spun the wrong way.
[27:20.170 --> 27:20.330]  Okay.
[27:20.550 --> 27:20.830]  There we go.
[27:20.830 --> 27:21.070]  That's all right.
[27:21.310 --> 27:21.790]  We got...
[27:21.790 --> 27:22.050]  Here we go.
[27:22.070 --> 27:23.410]  This game makes me feel smart.
[27:23.790 --> 27:24.070]  Wrong way.
[27:24.250 --> 27:25.310]  We're killing these puzzles.
[27:26.030 --> 27:26.470]  Here we go.
[27:26.470 --> 27:27.190]  Nope.
[27:27.270 --> 27:27.650]  Puzzles.
[27:28.230 --> 27:28.630]  Yeah.
[27:28.630 --> 27:29.890]  What are you playing at?
[27:30.730 --> 27:31.690]  He's trying to puzzle.
[27:32.930 --> 27:34.470]  He's been puzzling right now.
[27:34.510 --> 27:35.130]  Not doing that.
[27:35.210 --> 27:35.790]  He's got it.
[27:35.910 --> 27:36.030]  Okay.
[27:36.150 --> 27:37.090]  It's tricky, man.
[27:37.210 --> 27:38.250]  It's tricky to be an elf.
[27:38.470 --> 27:38.790]  There you go.
[27:39.150 --> 27:40.610]  Oh, you just back...
[27:40.610 --> 27:41.690]  Oh, I just bonked it up.
[27:43.350 --> 27:44.170]  There you go.
[27:44.250 --> 27:44.570]  There you go.
[27:44.610 --> 27:45.670]  That'll work, that'll work, that'll work.
[27:45.930 --> 27:46.710]  Let me sit down.
[27:46.810 --> 27:47.430]  There we go.
[27:47.650 --> 27:47.850]  Okay.
[27:48.130 --> 27:48.390]  Yeah.
[27:48.730 --> 27:50.410]  Oh, lined up real good.
[27:50.670 --> 27:51.110]  Early sit.
[27:51.210 --> 27:51.750]  That was smart.
[27:51.930 --> 27:52.510]  There we go.
[27:52.590 --> 27:52.770]  Yeah.
[27:53.330 --> 27:54.090]  Nick, are you...
[27:57.810 --> 28:03.390]  ThatMexican98 says we were in the red zone where I live until it made landfall and turned just so slightly.
[28:03.550 --> 28:04.610]  Well, thank God it turned slightly.
[28:05.210 --> 28:05.570]  Woof.
[28:05.670 --> 28:06.110]  Yeah, no kidding.
[28:06.510 --> 28:06.670]  All right.
[28:06.690 --> 28:07.470]  What were you going to ask, Gavin?
[28:07.630 --> 28:07.750]  What?
[28:08.110 --> 28:10.110]  Well, I can't tell if you're doing a bit.
[28:11.950 --> 28:12.770]  That's how I feel.
[28:12.810 --> 28:14.430]  I assure you, no bit is being had.
[28:15.210 --> 28:18.470]  Gavin, I feel that way about you 85% of the time when we're playing games.
[28:19.170 --> 28:21.750]  These physics are wreaking havoc on my brain.
[28:23.430 --> 28:25.390]  I like shopping every time.
[28:25.630 --> 28:26.430]  Every two times.
[28:27.390 --> 28:28.290]  Ooh, a lamp.
[28:28.650 --> 28:29.510]  Oh, my stamp cards.
[28:30.050 --> 28:31.430]  God, it's gonna be a while before I get a sub now.
[28:31.490 --> 28:32.690]  I got another nameplate.
[28:32.970 --> 28:34.490]  Oh, I got a nameplate as...
[28:35.450 --> 28:37.090]  Goddamn, this constant shopping.
[28:37.950 --> 28:38.450]  You know what?
[28:41.250 --> 28:42.630]  You know what I have like a stamp?
[28:42.810 --> 28:46.990]  I have like 6,000 stamp cards to lick ice cream, but I always forget them.
[28:48.690 --> 28:50.090]  Do you gotta lick ice cream a lot?
[28:51.450 --> 28:54.310]  Uh, we do trivia at BD Riley sometimes.
[28:54.750 --> 28:55.890]  And there's a lick right next door.
[28:56.230 --> 29:00.430]  And so I, being unable to resist the sweet siren call of ice cream...
[29:01.210 --> 29:03.030]  The official pub of Liverpool.
[29:03.610 --> 29:04.750]  We should have a trivia team.
[29:06.710 --> 29:08.890]  Except Eric doesn't want to do anything organized.
[29:09.630 --> 29:11.450]  He got so mad when I recommended a softball game.
[29:12.030 --> 29:13.290]  And all that crime he suggested?
[29:13.530 --> 29:14.590]  He didn't want any of that either.
[29:15.750 --> 29:16.850]  Yeah, messed up.
[29:17.550 --> 29:18.590]  I would do trivia.
[29:19.430 --> 29:19.750]  Yeah.
[29:20.430 --> 29:23.410]  Emily and I did trivia, I want to say on our second date.
[29:23.570 --> 29:25.230]  And we were like both like, this is so much fun.
[29:25.290 --> 29:26.010]  We should do it all the time.
[29:26.190 --> 29:27.390]  I've never done it since.
[29:27.470 --> 29:30.210]  But it was a great icebreaker for a date.
[29:31.050 --> 29:34.770]  I don't know if my friend is a Latin teacher.
[29:35.650 --> 29:36.410]  Fucking brag about it.
[29:36.410 --> 29:36.990]  He's usually the one.
[29:37.270 --> 29:38.950]  Well, he's the one usually carrying the team.
[29:39.030 --> 29:43.970]  So I don't know if it'd be as fun without like an anchor.
[29:44.190 --> 29:44.530]  You know what I mean?
[29:44.790 --> 29:46.150]  Oh, it's gonna roll right over you.
[29:46.150 --> 29:49.650]  Oh, but we have Gavin.
[29:49.870 --> 29:51.610]  He has all the British knowledge.
[29:51.750 --> 29:54.370]  This sounds wrong, but somehow I think the water will be doomed.
[29:54.790 --> 29:57.910]  Yeah, I think that's a smart early date idea.
[29:58.090 --> 30:01.830]  Because it lets you know if the other person is an idiot or not.
[30:01.870 --> 30:02.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[30:02.870 --> 30:05.570]  Or if they're way too into something you're not into.
[30:06.670 --> 30:09.050]  Oh, like if they know too much about something.
[30:09.230 --> 30:09.530]  Right.
[30:09.570 --> 30:11.010]  Like if you're like, I like Harry Potter too.
[30:11.090 --> 30:13.470]  But that's a lot of Harry Potter, you know, or something like that.
[30:14.390 --> 30:15.030]  Let's go!
[30:17.010 --> 30:19.850]  I don't know, I could do without the pushing the ball in the hole part.
[30:19.970 --> 30:20.990]  I just want to make the shape.
[30:22.790 --> 30:25.390]  I think this is gonna be how it goes, but I might be wrong.
[30:26.130 --> 30:27.010]  Okay, we got it.
[30:27.010 --> 30:27.610]  It's not, I was right.
[30:28.530 --> 30:29.110]  Where do I go?
[30:30.850 --> 30:31.690]  Here, I'll move out of the way.
[30:37.840 --> 30:38.160]  No.
[30:39.100 --> 30:39.420]  No.
[30:39.660 --> 30:39.880]  No.
[30:39.880 --> 30:40.820]  I think we locked it in.
[30:40.940 --> 30:41.260]  No.
[30:41.840 --> 30:42.160]  No.
[30:42.240 --> 30:43.180]  What do you mean we locked it in?
[30:43.660 --> 30:45.680]  I think I go in the middle and then yeah.
[30:45.740 --> 30:46.000]  Yeah.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.300]  Now we need blue to...
[30:48.300 --> 30:48.680]  Come on, Andrew.
[30:48.900 --> 30:49.600]  I can't, there's...
[30:49.600 --> 30:50.960]  Maybe, maybe it's pink with...
[30:50.960 --> 30:52.340]  Here, I'll tell you what, I'll move up.
[30:52.380 --> 30:52.840]  There you go.
[30:52.940 --> 30:55.420]  I was just trying to get here the whole time and I was being blocked.
[30:55.720 --> 30:56.180]  There you go, there we go.
[30:56.540 --> 30:56.760]  Oh.
[30:58.100 --> 30:59.280]  Flipping hell, of course you're the one.
[30:59.460 --> 31:01.320]  Oh, balls.
[31:03.420 --> 31:05.120]  Gavin, can you, can you...
[31:05.120 --> 31:06.420]  You don't need me to...
[31:06.420 --> 31:07.540]  Nick, just turn around.
[31:08.300 --> 31:09.280]  How do I turn?
[31:09.600 --> 31:12.260]  Just bump your left thing, bump your top thing on something.
[31:12.880 --> 31:14.240]  Like hook it on my arsehole.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.660]  What are you doing?
[31:15.660 --> 31:18.720]  Hey, hook it on his arsehole.
[31:19.580 --> 31:21.320]  What are you doing, Nick?
[31:21.380 --> 31:22.480]  You're doing a bit.
[31:26.580 --> 31:28.700]  I swear I'm not doing anything.
[31:28.980 --> 31:32.300]  It's not like Andrew's doing any better than Nick right now.
[31:32.540 --> 31:33.960]  What's everyone on about?
[31:34.660 --> 31:36.200]  Just smear the corners.
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.740]  Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[31:39.260 --> 31:41.100]  There we go, there we go, there we go.
[31:41.820 --> 31:42.180]  Oh boy.
[31:45.540 --> 31:46.580]  Classic Nick.
[31:48.480 --> 31:51.720]  I like the way Nick gets shit on, but it took Andrew another 20 seconds.
[31:53.520 --> 31:55.920]  I'm getting all the Nick.
[31:58.680 --> 32:00.260]  Oh, double MVPs.
[32:00.520 --> 32:01.800]  How the hell does that work?
[32:05.600 --> 32:11.020]  Uh, speaking of trivia, I found the trivia, I think, that I used for the
[32:12.440 --> 32:15.140]  the sports pub trivia I hosted.
[32:16.160 --> 32:18.480]  Oh, I found, I found some of the docs.
[32:18.660 --> 32:21.360]  I also, and also from when I was a producer on a sports show.
[32:21.980 --> 32:22.620]  Hell yeah.
[32:22.700 --> 32:27.820]  We should have a trivia night where Nick gives us trivia and we have to do it.
[32:28.100 --> 32:28.960]  Dude, special map.
[32:29.520 --> 32:30.040]  We're playing footy?
[32:30.520 --> 32:32.700]  We should play, oh, we could call it quiz Nick.
[32:32.980 --> 32:33.580]  Oh shit.
[32:33.960 --> 32:34.600]  I think we're in teams.
[32:36.240 --> 32:37.580]  Okay, Gavin, you and I.
[32:38.620 --> 32:39.860]  Oh, my recording crashed.
[32:39.860 --> 32:41.180]  I hope we didn't need the backup.
[32:41.840 --> 32:42.740]  Nah, we'll be all right.
[32:42.880 --> 32:43.120]  Okay.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.840]  Why did we let you be the backup?
[32:46.360 --> 32:47.280]  In the same way that...
[32:47.280 --> 32:49.180]  Because I couldn't record at all today earlier.
[32:50.360 --> 32:52.740]  Yeah, we did, we did lose a little something, didn't you?
[32:53.260 --> 32:53.520]  Yeah.
[32:53.780 --> 32:54.140]  All right.
[32:54.380 --> 32:56.020]  Plushmines, the team to score more balls.
[32:56.340 --> 32:57.440]  Oh, Gavin, we got this.
[32:57.660 --> 32:58.340]  Oh, shit.
[32:58.340 --> 32:59.000]  Oh, it's you, Geoff.
[32:59.220 --> 33:00.680]  Oh, shh.
[33:00.780 --> 33:01.080]  No.
[33:01.340 --> 33:02.600]  Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.
[33:02.820 --> 33:03.660]  No, I'm being turned.
[33:04.180 --> 33:04.500]  Get him.
[33:04.540 --> 33:06.860]  No, no, no.
[33:07.240 --> 33:07.800]  Scoring on my own.
[33:07.800 --> 33:08.860]  Geoff, you score, I'll goal.
[33:08.860 --> 33:10.400]  Oh, I'm scoring, baby.
[33:10.700 --> 33:11.600]  Scoring all day.
[33:13.460 --> 33:14.900]  Now get that weak shit out of here.
[33:15.500 --> 33:15.900]  Shit.
[33:17.920 --> 33:18.320]  No.
[33:21.040 --> 33:21.380]  No.
[33:21.580 --> 33:22.500]  Got one, got one, got one.
[33:29.150 --> 33:29.550]  Ow.
[33:29.630 --> 33:31.270]  Oh, don't forget you can hold A to run.
[33:31.390 --> 33:32.150]  I totally forgot.
[33:33.090 --> 33:33.750]  No, you can't.
[33:35.470 --> 33:35.870]  No, you can't.
[33:35.870 --> 33:41.660]  Oh, no.
[33:42.740 --> 33:43.140]  Shit.
[33:43.440 --> 33:43.980]  Goddammit, Nick.
[33:44.860 --> 33:45.580]  Fuck off, Andrew.
[33:45.800 --> 33:46.480]  See if the player scored a goal.
[33:47.080 --> 33:48.280]  No, no.
[33:49.100 --> 33:49.960]  What a strike.
[33:50.960 --> 33:51.640]  No.
[33:53.180 --> 33:54.140]  Get in there.
[33:54.140 --> 33:54.680]  Get in there.
[33:56.160 --> 33:56.840]  Christ.
[33:57.220 --> 34:00.240]  Oh, no, no, no.
[34:01.380 --> 34:01.680]  Go.
[34:03.040 --> 34:03.280]  Geoff.
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.140]  Gavin, come on.
[34:08.360 --> 34:08.380]  Goddammit.
[34:09.760 --> 34:10.640]  Go, Nick.
[34:10.700 --> 34:11.080]  Oh, no.
[34:11.480 --> 34:12.300]  My own weakness.
[34:16.700 --> 34:17.020]  No.
[34:18.140 --> 34:19.140]  Get it in there, you little...
[34:21.420 --> 34:22.260]  Oh, shit, Geoff.
[34:22.280 --> 34:23.120]  We gotta score fast.
[34:23.220 --> 34:23.900]  I know, I know.
[34:24.060 --> 34:24.520]  I gotta get...
[34:24.520 --> 34:25.560]  I wish I was spun around.
[34:26.520 --> 34:28.360]  You'll be seeing all this on match of the day later.
[34:28.560 --> 34:29.140]  Oh, shit.
[34:29.180 --> 34:30.000]  No, rolling in.
[34:30.240 --> 34:30.820]  That's a goal.
[34:30.900 --> 34:31.440]  It's a buzzer.
[34:31.860 --> 34:32.020]  Yeah.
[34:32.780 --> 34:33.580]  Oh, he didn't do it.
[34:33.580 --> 34:34.260]  That sucks.
[34:34.500 --> 34:34.600]  Dude.
[34:34.720 --> 34:35.240]  Fuck you.
[34:35.680 --> 34:36.500]  Nice, Gavin.
[34:38.280 --> 34:39.340]  I'm giving all mine to Nick.
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.560]  That was close.
[34:41.820 --> 34:44.160]  Why are you giving me any hearts, Gavin?
[34:44.280 --> 34:45.240]  I gave you all the hearts.
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.260]  It's a two-way team.
[34:47.640 --> 34:48.440]  Oh, sorry.
[34:53.400 --> 34:55.040]  Oh, that's a lot of coins.
[34:56.440 --> 34:58.920]  Has anyone here tried making mashed potatoes yet?
[34:59.020 --> 34:59.900]  The audience wants to know.
[35:00.460 --> 35:01.340]  Oh, boy.
[35:01.460 --> 35:02.160]  We did.
[35:03.080 --> 35:04.020]  Look for that out.
[35:04.120 --> 35:04.340]  Coming soon.
[35:04.780 --> 35:10.760]  Well, coming is whenever we get through the previous company's supplementals.
[35:12.020 --> 35:13.500]  Oh, I'm skinned.
[35:13.500 --> 35:14.320]  You have a bit of a backlog.
[35:14.680 --> 35:14.940]  Yeah.
[35:16.680 --> 35:17.200]  All right.
[35:17.240 --> 35:17.720]  I see the heart.
[35:17.820 --> 35:18.160]  Let me go.
[35:19.540 --> 35:20.100]  Uh-oh.
[35:20.980 --> 35:21.600]  Uh-oh.
[35:22.500 --> 35:22.900]  What?
[35:24.360 --> 35:25.160]  OBS crashed.
[35:27.220 --> 35:27.620]  Right.
[35:28.040 --> 35:28.660]  We know.
[35:29.540 --> 35:32.020]  The recording crashed before, but now the whole thing crashed.
[35:32.100 --> 35:32.960]  I can't see anything.
[35:35.040 --> 35:35.620]  All right.
[35:35.660 --> 35:36.860]  Well, we'll just have to guide you.
[35:38.560 --> 35:39.740]  Run in safe mode.
[35:39.800 --> 35:40.880]  No, I don't want to run in safe mode.
[35:40.960 --> 35:42.840]  Open the freaking preview window.
[35:43.100 --> 35:43.340]  There we go.
[35:43.340 --> 35:46.360]  I'm so fucking glad it wasn't just me today.
[35:46.920 --> 35:49.140]  God, misery definitely loves company.
[35:51.320 --> 35:53.320]  And I am misery.
[35:56.780 --> 35:58.140]  Oh, let's see.
[35:59.580 --> 36:00.900]  Attach blocks by shape.
[36:02.900 --> 36:04.100]  Oh, another achievement.
[36:05.060 --> 36:05.580]  Oh, yeah.
[36:05.780 --> 36:07.040]  Loads of achievements.
[36:07.980 --> 36:08.280]  Okay.
[36:08.320 --> 36:09.560]  I see which one I'm supposed to be.
[36:12.900 --> 36:13.860]  Oh, wait, what?
[36:15.640 --> 36:16.060]  Shit.
[36:16.080 --> 36:16.620]  What the hell was it?
[36:19.970 --> 36:20.530]  Why can't I?
[36:20.530 --> 36:20.950]  Well, shut up.
[36:21.150 --> 36:21.910]  Hell just happened.
[36:22.090 --> 36:24.450]  Oh, do I have to move it to do that?
[36:24.650 --> 36:24.970]  Okay.
[36:25.590 --> 36:26.470]  Why can't I move?
[36:27.110 --> 36:27.650]  God damn.
[36:29.390 --> 36:31.930]  Oh, do I need to do it to free myself first?
[36:33.310 --> 36:33.530]  You.
[36:37.330 --> 36:38.470]  Say it, you bitch.
[36:41.890 --> 36:42.730]  All right.
[36:42.730 --> 36:44.910]  I'll just do the other thing that I'm supposed to do.
[36:47.970 --> 36:48.570]  I'm in.
[36:49.590 --> 36:50.730]  You okay, Nick?
[36:51.350 --> 36:51.810]  I'm all right.
[36:53.870 --> 36:55.070]  If I'm a big dick.
[36:55.450 --> 36:59.310]  Somebody has made it very difficult for Geoff to get out of the fucking game.
[37:00.990 --> 37:01.410]  There we go.
[37:01.530 --> 37:01.610]  Get.
[37:01.890 --> 37:02.290]  I got you.
[37:02.530 --> 37:02.850]  Oh, my.
[37:05.930 --> 37:07.110]  I have a question.
[37:07.950 --> 37:08.750]  It's not a bit.
[37:09.170 --> 37:10.370]  I have a question for the group.
[37:10.770 --> 37:11.090]  Okay.
[37:13.190 --> 37:14.570]  Nick, are you doing it like a bit?
[37:19.090 --> 37:20.090]  No, not a bit.
[37:21.050 --> 37:22.310]  Just very stupid.
[37:24.450 --> 37:25.330]  Get up, dummy.
[37:28.030 --> 37:28.390]  Stop.
[37:30.250 --> 37:31.870]  You need to take it with you.
[37:32.970 --> 37:35.110]  When you want to unsnap from it, you just move.
[37:35.170 --> 37:36.090]  You don't have to press A or anything.
[37:40.340 --> 37:40.840]  Uh-huh.
[37:43.080 --> 37:43.440]  Okay.
[37:44.120 --> 37:45.540]  I don't know.
[37:46.240 --> 37:47.460]  Getting out of y'all's way.
[37:50.560 --> 37:52.760]  I'm just sat here showing you where I'm going to go.
[37:52.820 --> 37:53.980]  I can move if you want me to.
[37:54.660 --> 37:55.980]  I can't fucking move.
[37:58.500 --> 38:00.060]  All right, let me get out of here.
[38:00.880 --> 38:02.800]  I just want to put this fucking block down.
[38:02.880 --> 38:03.600]  Why won't it let me?
[38:03.740 --> 38:04.140]  Stop.
[38:07.560 --> 38:09.000]  It just won't let me.
[38:09.900 --> 38:10.360]  All right.
[38:10.620 --> 38:11.360]  All right.
[38:11.500 --> 38:12.040]  God damn it.
[38:12.040 --> 38:13.560]  Which one do you want to drop it on?
[38:13.660 --> 38:14.140]  I don't care.
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.320]  I just want to drop it on that one.
[38:15.480 --> 38:15.980]  Oh, you went over it.
[38:16.060 --> 38:16.540]  You went over it.
[38:16.720 --> 38:16.940]  I know.
[38:16.940 --> 38:18.220]  I just got to spin back around more.
[38:18.380 --> 38:19.160]  No, just put it down now.
[38:19.280 --> 38:19.660]  Put it down now.
[38:19.680 --> 38:20.380]  It won't let me.
[38:20.880 --> 38:21.400]  No, no.
[38:21.860 --> 38:22.300]  One over.
[38:25.360 --> 38:26.040]  Yeah, there, there.
[38:26.100 --> 38:26.640]  There, put it there.
[38:27.340 --> 38:27.660]  Nice.
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.040]  All right, now you move.
[38:29.760 --> 38:31.120]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[38:31.280 --> 38:32.260]  I'm gonna drop the dipshit.
[38:32.720 --> 38:33.100]  Hold on.
[38:33.260 --> 38:33.660]  Here we go.
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.460]  All right, I missed.
[38:37.520 --> 38:38.580]  I'm gonna drop the dipshit.
[38:38.780 --> 38:39.500]  There we go.
[38:39.940 --> 38:41.720]  I need to squeeze where you are up there.
[38:42.040 --> 38:43.220]  Let's go together.
[38:44.020 --> 38:44.460]  All right.
[38:44.560 --> 38:45.420]  Oh, this is a nightmare.
[38:47.140 --> 38:47.760]  All right, hold on.
[38:48.320 --> 38:50.240]  Let me, uh, let me shimmy shake.
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.780]  Seems like you probably want to go...
[38:54.780 --> 38:55.640]  Like a glove.
[38:55.900 --> 38:56.380]  Down and up.
[38:56.380 --> 38:57.240]  Blue, you want to go...
[38:57.240 --> 38:57.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep.
[39:01.760 --> 39:03.900]  I want Eric to watch this footage
[39:03.900 --> 39:05.840]  and determine if Nick's doing a bit or not.
[39:05.980 --> 39:07.120]  It's not a bit!
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.220]  I just suck!
[39:10.440 --> 39:11.540]  You fucking asshole.
[39:13.900 --> 39:14.820]  There you go.
[39:16.560 --> 39:20.060]  I went down like that just to lock it in directionally.
[39:20.440 --> 39:20.700]  That's fair.
[39:20.820 --> 39:24.800]  I don't know why I just cannot pivot around the corners.
[39:24.800 --> 39:26.940]  Just smear the corners on stuff, Nick.
[39:27.020 --> 39:28.000]  Just smear it.
[39:28.280 --> 39:30.140]  You turn around in like two seconds.
[39:32.100 --> 39:34.780]  What the fuck does smear the corners mean?
[39:35.300 --> 39:37.160]  Just hug the, just hug shit and turn.
[39:37.460 --> 39:39.040]  Just fucking hug, I guess.
[39:39.180 --> 39:39.560]  Smear?
[39:39.720 --> 39:40.200]  What the fuck?
[39:40.400 --> 39:42.600]  Spread, you know, like a bagel.
[39:43.720 --> 39:44.920]  Yeah, bagel smear.
[39:50.050 --> 39:52.050]  That's your office, I don't want to smear anything around.
[39:55.890 --> 39:59.050]  I want to play until I get my next sub.
[40:03.470 --> 40:05.250]  I'm just gonna wait here, I've waited too long.
[40:05.410 --> 40:07.410]  I've got two stamps on my free sub card.
[40:09.590 --> 40:11.990]  One sec, I gotta change my name, I gotta get one.
[40:12.710 --> 40:14.050]  Don't forget the running, Andrew.
[40:14.050 --> 40:14.650]  The running.
[40:14.970 --> 40:15.990]  Oh yeah, hold A, thanks.
[40:17.830 --> 40:19.470]  I'm an overslept detective.
[40:19.970 --> 40:20.850]  Let's do this!
[40:25.090 --> 40:26.950]  You could have prevented the murder.
[40:27.490 --> 40:29.170]  I could have, but I overslept.
[40:30.010 --> 40:31.550]  I like Geoff's, it's just monster.
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.430]  I'm the idiot.
[40:38.650 --> 40:39.610]  Yeah, well.
[40:42.850 --> 40:43.810]  What's the...
[40:43.810 --> 40:44.490]  It's a creeper.
[40:46.010 --> 40:46.730]  Creeper head.
[40:47.050 --> 40:48.250]  Hey Gavin, it's your parents.
[41:06.850 --> 41:09.390]  Oh Christ, we just need to spin around.
[41:12.390 --> 41:15.910]  Oh no, we just need to spin around, we just need to do like 360.
[41:20.890 --> 41:22.550]  Purple needs to flip.
[41:22.890 --> 41:23.610]  Or pink.
[41:24.630 --> 41:26.370]  Gavin's not gonna let us out.
[41:27.510 --> 41:28.610]  He's killing us.
[41:28.690 --> 41:28.950]  Come on.
[41:28.950 --> 41:30.230]  He's not gonna let us out.
[41:32.070 --> 41:33.430]  You're coming with me.
[41:37.010 --> 41:39.970]  Get away, I'm on the edge, I'm on the dippy edge.
[41:40.490 --> 41:41.990]  You can't kill people in this game, huh?
[41:42.490 --> 41:44.550]  Oh yeah, I feel a lot better about it.
[41:45.030 --> 41:46.370]  Yeah, I don't seem to be able to die.
[41:46.510 --> 41:46.870]  I'm trying.
[41:47.590 --> 41:49.810]  If we stand still, can you flip?
[41:52.190 --> 41:53.110]  Here, try it.
[41:53.270 --> 41:58.450]  You and the blue are at the bottom, and then me and uh piss cat will figure out the top.
[42:01.470 --> 42:03.170]  Try to get these coins.
[42:04.430 --> 42:05.150]  You pull those coins?
[42:05.490 --> 42:06.110]  You're yanking my chain.
[42:06.770 --> 42:07.430]  Yeah, I know.
[42:08.150 --> 42:08.550]  There we go.
[42:09.370 --> 42:11.730]  Now what do we do?
[42:12.870 --> 42:14.010]  We need to get him in position.
[42:14.350 --> 42:16.910]  We get Gavin in position, and then I think blue gets in position.
[42:17.370 --> 42:18.690]  Yeah, blue goes down there.
[42:19.130 --> 42:19.650]  Oh, I see.
[42:19.650 --> 42:23.510]  Okay, uh, one sec, one sec.
[42:23.810 --> 42:24.490]  Hold on, I'll move.
[42:24.890 --> 42:27.850]  All right, if green can move that way, I can move this way.
[42:28.330 --> 42:30.770]  If you stop shoving the shit out of me, I can sit down.
[42:31.350 --> 42:32.150]  Sit down!
[42:32.630 --> 42:33.810]  And you're touching me!
[42:34.070 --> 42:34.390]  There you go.
[42:34.450 --> 42:35.030]  There we go.
[42:35.210 --> 42:36.410]  There you go, spin that.
[42:36.530 --> 42:37.030]  We got it.
[42:37.230 --> 42:38.190]  There we go!
[42:41.410 --> 42:42.070]  Sit down.
[42:42.410 --> 42:42.810]  Nice.
[42:43.110 --> 42:44.250]  Now I just need to spin.
[42:48.510 --> 42:50.090]  Gavin is losing his mind.
[42:50.530 --> 42:52.770]  It's harder than Gavin wants you to believe.
[42:52.770 --> 42:54.890]  All right, I'm sitting to lock myself in.
[42:55.050 --> 42:57.470]  Now I'm speaking up, and now I'm locking in.
[42:58.070 --> 42:58.990]  Is it harder?
[42:59.390 --> 43:00.270]  Sit down, Nick!
[43:00.270 --> 43:00.930]  You're not sitting!
[43:02.350 --> 43:04.270]  Even Andrew's getting pissed off.
[43:06.550 --> 43:07.770]  He needs to sit!
[43:08.210 --> 43:09.490]  I hit the A button!
[43:09.590 --> 43:10.790]  Why the fuck won't he sit?
[43:12.290 --> 43:13.230]  No, you weren't.
[43:13.290 --> 43:13.830]  That was the problem.
[43:14.030 --> 43:15.830]  It's hard to sit if you're getting schmeared.
[43:16.490 --> 43:16.970]  That is true.
[43:17.170 --> 43:18.030]  Okay, okay.
[43:18.570 --> 43:19.190]  That's a great point.
[43:20.090 --> 43:21.310]  I'm a corner.
[43:23.950 --> 43:25.650]  Dude, we fucking nailed that.
[43:26.530 --> 43:27.450]  That went really well.
[43:33.810 --> 43:35.270]  I'm sitting right now.
[43:39.610 --> 43:41.430]  We need to make an Among Us alien.
[43:43.510 --> 43:45.690]  Or an A that's trying to hug you.
[43:46.070 --> 43:46.830]  Or a huggy A.
[43:47.030 --> 43:47.810]  Yeah, that's true too.
[43:48.470 --> 43:49.210]  A huggy A.
[43:49.470 --> 43:50.090]  Red beginner.
[43:53.740 --> 43:55.040]  I think Nick's the alien.
[43:56.240 --> 43:56.960]  I might be.
[44:02.430 --> 44:06.030]  Well, at least I don't have much responsibility in this one.
[44:09.630 --> 44:11.690]  Okay, I'm probably going...
[44:11.690 --> 44:12.490]  I'm probably the kid at the top.
[44:12.550 --> 44:14.470]  I'm probably the hat at the top.
[44:15.750 --> 44:16.230]  I'll go here.
[44:20.970 --> 44:21.750]  Or should I go...
[44:22.650 --> 44:23.670]  No, you were right.
[44:23.770 --> 44:24.170]  You were right.
[44:24.350 --> 44:25.150]  Let me be the roof.
[44:26.070 --> 44:27.290]  Yeah, you need to be the roof.
[44:28.290 --> 44:30.570]  Yeah, and then I'll fill in on the left side.
[44:31.390 --> 44:32.290]  And Andrew gets the right.
[44:33.370 --> 44:34.510]  Uh, Andrew needs to be on the left.
[44:34.690 --> 44:37.010]  Why the flipping...
[44:37.010 --> 44:37.270]  Boom.
[44:37.550 --> 44:37.730]  Boom.
[44:38.130 --> 44:38.770]  There we go.
[44:39.730 --> 44:41.250]  All you guys got to do is just do it.
[44:41.650 --> 44:41.910]  Yep.
[44:42.010 --> 44:43.210]  You're in the wrong place.
[44:44.490 --> 44:44.850]  Yeah.
[44:45.270 --> 44:46.030]  Oh, am I?
[44:46.150 --> 44:47.250]  Yeah, you need to go that way.
[44:47.530 --> 44:47.830]  Yeah.
[44:49.230 --> 44:50.610]  Sorry, I stopped paying attention.
[44:51.650 --> 44:53.310]  To when I said Andrew needs to be on the left.
[44:53.310 --> 44:53.810]  I...
[44:54.690 --> 44:55.530]  You said that?
[44:56.710 --> 44:57.790]  Oh, so easy.
[45:03.490 --> 45:04.210]  Oh, Christ.
[45:06.130 --> 45:06.790]  I'm gonna...
[45:06.790 --> 45:07.230]  You know what, Gavin?
[45:07.290 --> 45:07.710]  You were good.
[45:07.850 --> 45:08.490]  You're good on that one.
[45:08.490 --> 45:09.290]  I'll give you some hearts.
[45:09.650 --> 45:10.310]  Yeah, that was good.
[45:10.530 --> 45:10.730]  I'll take...
[45:12.850 --> 45:13.570]  I'll like...
[45:15.230 --> 45:15.590]  Bunts.
[45:25.570 --> 45:27.110]  Chill end to a week.
[45:27.650 --> 45:28.690]  Hey, man, that's right.
[45:28.710 --> 45:29.590]  It's almost 5.01.
[45:30.110 --> 45:31.590]  We only have 13 minutes to go.
[45:37.770 --> 45:38.730]  I, uh...
[45:38.730 --> 45:42.750]  I had so much fun recording the podcast with you guys yesterday.
[45:43.430 --> 45:44.150]  Yeah, it was great.
[45:44.470 --> 45:48.030]  It felt like it had been a year since we had recorded a podcast together.
[45:48.710 --> 45:49.190]  Yeah.
[45:50.110 --> 45:50.510]  Yeah.
[45:52.090 --> 45:53.950]  It creates such an interesting dynamic.
[45:53.950 --> 45:58.470]  It teaches you to hate travel because it disrupts the routine,
[45:58.610 --> 46:03.490]  but then also it creates such an anticipation as well that it's almost, you know, it's kind of worth it.
[46:10.480 --> 46:12.520]  All right, we just gotta match the shape.
[46:13.580 --> 46:14.520]  I can be the...
[46:15.040 --> 46:16.120]  I'll be the roof again.
[46:17.540 --> 46:18.760]  Andrew's coming in hot.
[46:21.240 --> 46:22.120]  Definitely fucking...
[46:22.120 --> 46:22.980]  All right, I'm gonna go up top.
[46:23.400 --> 46:24.680]  I think I'm on top.
[46:25.240 --> 46:25.620]  Oh, okay.
[46:26.240 --> 46:27.140]  I think I'm right here.
[46:31.270 --> 46:31.630]  Okay.
[46:33.030 --> 46:34.590]  All right, I'm gonna spin around.
[46:35.390 --> 46:36.110]  I was right.
[46:36.290 --> 46:38.770]  Holy shit, I just wasn't making a joke, but I was right.
[46:39.250 --> 46:40.990]  Okay, I'll go in my spot.
[46:44.780 --> 46:45.960]  I see where I'm supposed to go.
[46:46.800 --> 46:48.660]  Yeah, I just gotta get up to my spot.
[46:48.700 --> 46:49.380]  Oh, there you go.
[46:49.440 --> 46:50.120]  Nice, Geoff.
[46:51.920 --> 46:52.960]  Taking my time.
[46:53.120 --> 46:54.860]  I'm gonna back up a little bit to straighten that out.
[46:54.860 --> 46:55.600]  There you go.
[46:55.740 --> 46:56.220]  Oh, oh, oh.
[46:56.480 --> 46:57.620]  No, no, we're good, we're good.
[46:57.640 --> 46:58.340]  There you go.
[47:00.380 --> 47:01.040]  Fuck yeah.
[47:02.300 --> 47:04.560]  Andrew with the blind correct cooler.
[47:04.580 --> 47:06.320]  Yep, I'm just gonna sit here.
[47:07.520 --> 47:08.320]  Sometimes it's...
[47:08.320 --> 47:08.780]  Oh, wow, right.
[47:09.120 --> 47:09.420]  Better be lucky than good.
[47:12.260 --> 47:13.220]  Yay, oh.
[47:14.140 --> 47:15.580]  Is that because I wasn't an idiot that time?
[47:16.760 --> 47:18.640]  You get all my hearts, Nick, every time.
[47:18.960 --> 47:19.360]  Aw.
[47:20.640 --> 47:21.620]  They're pity hearts.
[47:22.480 --> 47:24.460]  I got 350 bucks for the spinner.
[47:25.420 --> 47:27.080]  Oh, you got some money for that spinner?
[47:27.320 --> 47:29.100]  Yeah, I might spend a little bit of bunts too, actually.
[47:29.220 --> 47:29.880]  Let's do a little bit of shopping.
[47:30.600 --> 47:31.020]  A little shopping.
[47:31.020 --> 47:33.140]  Oh, what a table I've got.
[47:34.060 --> 47:35.580]  How does this motherfucking get...
[47:35.580 --> 47:37.320]  Oh, a puzzle skin.
[47:37.440 --> 47:38.800]  That's like right up my alley.
[47:39.040 --> 47:40.560]  Oh, that's perfect for you, Geoff.
[47:40.620 --> 47:41.540]  That is perfect for me.
[47:41.560 --> 47:42.420]  I'm the puzzle guy.
[47:42.980 --> 47:44.440]  I got accented gentleman.
[47:44.620 --> 47:45.540]  I think I went to the wrong guy.
[47:49.100 --> 47:51.600]  He should have got person who doesn't understand curves.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.640]  Another skin.
[47:52.940 --> 47:54.680]  I don't care about wave skin.
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.400]  Although I am a jet ski guy.
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.220]  Person who doesn't understand pivots.
[47:59.240 --> 48:00.240]  More of a puzzle guy.
[48:00.240 --> 48:01.580]  Oh, I got a watering can.
[48:03.360 --> 48:05.500]  You guys aren't really displaying a lot of furniture.
[48:06.080 --> 48:07.760]  I just got my first piece.
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.240]  Let me put my first piece of furniture down.
[48:15.980 --> 48:17.580]  I don't get judged by Gavin.
[48:19.020 --> 48:20.520]  You freaking moron.
[48:20.660 --> 48:21.360]  All right, there we go.
[48:21.920 --> 48:22.940]  Oh, I have more lamps.
[48:24.320 --> 48:25.420]  I got my puzzle.
[48:25.920 --> 48:27.200]  Can I do anything in my watering can?
[48:28.520 --> 48:29.180]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[48:29.180 --> 48:31.320]  Oh, I can do my name plate now.
[48:31.320 --> 48:32.820]  And then I can be...
[48:33.860 --> 48:34.220]  There we go.
[48:34.300 --> 48:35.080]  I did get a new skin.
[48:35.240 --> 48:36.520]  Change my name there.
[48:36.980 --> 48:37.940]  Let's throw that on.
[48:42.430 --> 48:44.070]  Yeah, see, I don't have any furniture.
[48:44.390 --> 48:44.810]  It's a bummer.
[48:45.790 --> 48:48.630]  Well, I got my puzzle skin.
[48:48.990 --> 48:49.470]  That's good.
[48:49.710 --> 48:50.850]  The antique table's gone down.
[48:51.250 --> 48:53.390]  Changed my name to annoying monster.
[48:57.460 --> 48:59.340]  Geoff, are you excited for postseason baseball?
[48:59.840 --> 49:00.380]  Yes, I am.
[49:00.620 --> 49:03.440]  I'm excited for Detroit Tigers in the playoffs.
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.160]  Magic number's one.
[49:07.920 --> 49:08.520]  Hell yeah.
[49:09.880 --> 49:11.580]  Have they scheduled those yet?
[49:12.280 --> 49:14.440]  No, I think the weekend still has to play out.
[49:14.540 --> 49:17.660]  I think in the NL, it's even dicier.
[49:18.540 --> 49:19.220]  It's real dicey.
[49:19.220 --> 49:21.980]  It's like a three-way race between the Braves and...
[49:24.380 --> 49:25.180]  The Mets.
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.120]  Yeah, Mets and some other team.
[49:28.120 --> 49:28.620]  And whoever else.
[49:28.700 --> 49:29.240]  Giants, maybe?
[49:29.480 --> 49:29.780]  I don't know.
[49:30.260 --> 49:31.240]  Might be.
[49:34.200 --> 49:35.300]  Who the hell am I again?
[49:36.000 --> 49:36.740]  Who am I?
[49:36.980 --> 49:37.360]  Oh, right.
[49:38.780 --> 49:39.560]  Oh, I should probably...
[49:40.480 --> 49:42.100]  Can someone come and sit on my butt?
[49:42.120 --> 49:42.880]  Oh, I see, I see.
[49:42.920 --> 49:43.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:43.740 --> 49:44.320]  Hold on, let me...
[49:47.160 --> 49:47.780]  You got it?
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.300]  Okay, I'll sit on your...
[49:49.300 --> 49:49.520]  Yeah, I got it.
[49:49.620 --> 49:50.140]  I'll sit on...
[49:50.140 --> 49:50.980]  There you go, I'll sit down.
[49:51.240 --> 49:53.120]  And then sit on the...
[49:53.660 --> 49:55.040]  Yeah, then I'll sit on your butt.
[49:55.040 --> 49:56.200]  I'll sit wherever you need me to sit.
[49:57.640 --> 49:58.500]  I'm blocking you?
[49:58.720 --> 49:59.300]  That's dumb.
[49:59.860 --> 50:00.120]  That's all right.
[50:01.040 --> 50:01.620]  All right.
[50:01.680 --> 50:02.080]  Oh, we're done.
[50:02.320 --> 50:03.320]  Now you're out.
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.160]  He sits on that.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.420]  And you can...
[50:09.420 --> 50:10.280]  I need someone to sit on my butt.
[50:10.280 --> 50:10.980]  And maybe I can...
[50:10.980 --> 50:11.760]  Can I...
[50:11.760 --> 50:12.940]  Bit over like that?
[50:13.120 --> 50:14.300]  Oh, nice.
[50:14.700 --> 50:15.000]  Yeah.
[50:16.820 --> 50:17.260]  Perfect.
[50:19.080 --> 50:19.640]  All right, you'll hold on.
[50:19.640 --> 50:22.560]  Now, you go sit on that, and then he can come out.
[50:23.420 --> 50:24.640]  You can get off of the thing.
[50:24.720 --> 50:27.860]  You know, that was a pretty big brain move there, I gotta say.
[50:27.860 --> 50:28.720]  Oh, genius.
[50:30.680 --> 50:31.500]  All right.
[50:31.500 --> 50:32.780]  Now, I need to spin...
[50:34.720 --> 50:35.460]  Doing it again.
[50:37.180 --> 50:39.500]  And blue, I need to be where you are, I think.
[50:41.000 --> 50:41.360]  Okay.
[50:41.660 --> 50:42.320]  And then pink...
[50:42.320 --> 50:42.920]  Oh, no, no, no.
[50:42.940 --> 50:44.480]  And then yellow needs to be the...
[50:44.480 --> 50:45.520]  I think blue is right.
[50:45.720 --> 50:45.900]  Oh.
[50:45.980 --> 50:46.880]  I think blue is right.
[50:47.560 --> 50:47.820]  Really?
[50:47.860 --> 50:48.580]  Because I think you can...
[50:49.380 --> 50:49.980]  Oh, maybe not.
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.820]  Oh, I just realized how long our shapes are.
[50:55.100 --> 50:56.460]  Because I feel like you and I are...
[50:57.300 --> 50:59.240]  Geoff, come down the side.
[50:59.720 --> 51:00.160]  Nick, go there.
[51:00.300 --> 51:00.460]  Yeah.
[51:01.920 --> 51:02.620]  Yeah, and then...
[51:03.500 --> 51:04.160]  Oh, no, I need to go up.
[51:04.220 --> 51:04.320]  Sorry.
[51:04.460 --> 51:04.900]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[51:05.080 --> 51:05.660]  I hit it wrong.
[51:06.860 --> 51:08.220]  I still have the input lag.
[51:08.220 --> 51:08.580]  There you go.
[51:09.460 --> 51:09.980]  Oh, right.
[51:10.120 --> 51:11.520]  I think I've gone, and then I haven't.
[51:11.620 --> 51:11.720]  Okay.
[51:11.780 --> 51:12.300]  Yeah, me too.
[51:12.400 --> 51:13.280]  That's why I've been such an idiot.
[51:13.280 --> 51:13.980]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.020]  Nick's having the same internet issues I am.
[51:18.400 --> 51:19.420]  This is Andrew's perspective.
[51:20.800 --> 51:21.220]  Stage clear.
[51:24.020 --> 51:26.180]  I like that we're all facing each other in the middle.
[51:28.240 --> 51:28.880]  We made it!
[51:28.900 --> 51:29.320]  We did it!
[51:32.700 --> 51:33.060]  We.
[51:41.860 --> 51:43.220]  I'm so glad I got furniture.
[51:43.640 --> 51:44.720]  $4.54.
[51:45.140 --> 51:46.380]  Everybody's got furniture but Geoff.
[51:46.480 --> 51:47.620]  But what are you going to do about it?
[51:47.820 --> 51:48.860]  You know, I'm living lean.
[51:49.260 --> 51:50.300]  Whoops, whoops.
[51:50.400 --> 51:52.480]  When I move, I'm not going to need any help.
[51:53.420 --> 51:54.180]  That is a good point.
[51:54.720 --> 51:56.280]  Dude, that's the kicker.
[51:56.300 --> 51:58.000]  And unfortunately for you guys, I'm out of town that weekend.
[52:01.120 --> 52:01.440]  What?
[52:01.820 --> 52:02.480]  When you need to move.
[52:02.920 --> 52:03.680]  Oh, I see.
[52:03.880 --> 52:03.960]  Yeah.
[52:04.820 --> 52:06.720]  I was like, why would you be out of town on the weekend you're moving?
[52:11.510 --> 52:12.710]  You hear Geoff's out of town?
[52:12.850 --> 52:13.850]  No, he just moved.
[52:15.930 --> 52:16.950]  To another town.
[52:17.390 --> 52:18.110]  Yeah, he's out of town.
[52:18.770 --> 52:19.490]  What did I say wrong?
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.480]  Let's do this.
[52:25.680 --> 52:26.200]  Oh, money.
[52:26.340 --> 52:27.420]  Okay, we gotta get the ball in the hole.
[52:27.520 --> 52:28.560]  Roll the ball into the hole.
[52:28.700 --> 52:29.020]  Catch!
[52:29.740 --> 52:30.340]  I'm catching.
[52:30.620 --> 52:30.940]  Where's his spawn?
[52:31.100 --> 52:31.680]  Oh.
[52:33.200 --> 52:34.160]  Oh, shit.
[52:34.500 --> 52:34.820]  Oh, no.
[52:35.400 --> 52:36.180]  I'd catch it.
[52:36.320 --> 52:37.000]  It's a good catch.
[52:38.080 --> 52:39.320]  No bonus for you.
[52:42.940 --> 52:44.380]  Why are you pushing it that way?
[52:44.620 --> 52:45.220]  What are you doing?
[52:45.420 --> 52:45.960]  Let's get a new one.
[52:45.980 --> 52:47.440]  I don't like the vibes of that one.
[52:47.680 --> 52:48.380]  Let's get a new one.
[52:48.480 --> 52:48.800]  I'll wait over here.
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.200]  I'm gonna hang out up here and catch it.
[52:52.480 --> 52:53.180]  Oh, shit.
[52:53.620 --> 52:54.440]  It's too fast.
[52:54.620 --> 52:54.940]  You know what?
[52:55.020 --> 52:56.540]  Sit down, you tool shit.
[52:57.020 --> 52:58.240]  Maybe I'll relax.
[53:00.320 --> 53:01.420]  What's going on over here, though?
[53:01.460 --> 53:01.800]  I'm sitting.
[53:01.940 --> 53:02.140]  I'm sitting.
[53:02.260 --> 53:02.540]  I'm kidding.
[53:04.140 --> 53:04.620]  All right.
[53:04.900 --> 53:06.780]  Now, you guys just gotta straight through.
[53:10.030 --> 53:11.350]  Or you can go the long way around.
[53:12.410 --> 53:14.090]  Take the long way home.
[53:14.730 --> 53:15.390]  Here, come push it.
[53:15.590 --> 53:16.730]  Gavin, I'll guard.
[53:17.670 --> 53:18.050]  All right.
[53:18.890 --> 53:19.770]  Oh, we gotta go around this way?
[53:20.030 --> 53:20.130]  Okay.
[53:20.350 --> 53:20.750]  Yeah, why not?
[53:20.850 --> 53:21.850]  We've already come this far.
[53:22.210 --> 53:23.010]  Yeah, fair play.
[53:24.770 --> 53:25.090]  Ouch.
[53:25.250 --> 53:25.570]  Just don't...
[53:27.170 --> 53:28.210]  Yeah, good.
[53:28.250 --> 53:29.330]  It's all safe on that corner.
[53:29.790 --> 53:30.550]  Looking good.
[53:30.670 --> 53:30.830]  Okay.
[53:31.030 --> 53:32.990]  Ain't gonna fall out on my side.
[53:33.350 --> 53:34.070]  Lovely stuff.
[53:34.970 --> 53:35.370]  Okay.
[53:35.970 --> 53:37.130]  I'll push it that way.
[53:37.190 --> 53:37.370]  Yep.
[53:37.410 --> 53:39.210]  Geoff, you help me anchor it.
[53:39.610 --> 53:39.750]  Okay.
[53:40.630 --> 53:41.110]  All right.
[53:42.370 --> 53:43.170]  Oh, careful.
[53:43.950 --> 53:44.770]  Let me be the wall.
[53:45.030 --> 53:46.030]  Okay, you be the wall.
[53:46.310 --> 53:46.870]  Let me get out of the way.
[53:47.550 --> 53:48.150]  I'll be this wall.
[53:51.230 --> 53:51.830]  All right.
[53:52.250 --> 53:53.850]  I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.
[53:54.170 --> 53:55.130]  Don't be an idiot about it.
[53:55.210 --> 53:56.110]  Nice, nice.
[53:56.310 --> 53:56.630]  Nice.
[53:56.630 --> 53:57.630]  Put some arrows on it.
[53:57.630 --> 53:58.070]  There we go.
[53:58.070 --> 54:00.130]  Ah, give me the coins.
[54:02.050 --> 54:02.770]  Let's see.
[54:04.290 --> 54:05.230]  Oh, I bet I could...
[54:07.750 --> 54:08.790]  Block me from getting in?
[54:08.950 --> 54:09.450]  Yes, you could.
[54:10.110 --> 54:10.790]  That's not me.
[54:13.090 --> 54:13.790]  Now I am.
[54:15.430 --> 54:16.930]  You can just move over to the other one.
[54:17.110 --> 54:17.510]  The other side.
[54:17.690 --> 54:17.890]  All right.
[54:18.110 --> 54:18.610]  Oh, I could.
[54:19.670 --> 54:20.390]  But I didn't.
[54:20.670 --> 54:21.130]  It's not a bit.
[54:21.670 --> 54:23.190]  Oh, not a bit.
[54:23.450 --> 54:24.410]  Geoff, if you stood up.
[54:24.950 --> 54:25.030]  Yeah.
[54:25.210 --> 54:26.210]  Nah, he didn't need it.
[54:26.530 --> 54:27.130]  There you go.
[54:28.790 --> 54:30.190]  Nah, he doesn't need it.
[54:30.490 --> 54:33.350]  He needs me to be stalwart and sturdy.
[54:33.510 --> 54:33.990]  Why would you go there?
[54:34.170 --> 54:35.210]  Why would you go there?
[54:35.350 --> 54:35.690]  Maybe go down.
[54:35.810 --> 54:36.270]  Where do you want me to go?
[54:36.490 --> 54:36.990]  There you go.
[54:37.190 --> 54:37.610]  Down!
[54:40.990 --> 54:41.790]  Sit down!
[54:42.010 --> 54:43.110]  Guys, it's 4.57.
[54:43.350 --> 54:46.190]  Can you believe we are only four minutes away from 5.01.
[54:46.330 --> 54:46.810]  5.01?
[54:47.170 --> 54:49.210]  The best moment of the week.
[54:50.210 --> 54:50.950]  Good sitting instructions.
[54:50.950 --> 54:54.310]  Everybody says, what do you have to be excited about 5.01 for?
[54:54.370 --> 54:56.090]  Your lives are fucking video games.
[54:56.090 --> 54:58.550]  That is a point.
[54:59.250 --> 55:00.130]  The audience doesn't make a point.
[55:00.690 --> 55:02.430]  Well, we're celebrating playing video games.
[55:02.470 --> 55:02.770]  That's true.
[55:02.950 --> 55:03.150]  Yeah.
[55:04.570 --> 55:06.270]  It's a different celebration, but it's still one.
[55:06.530 --> 55:06.710]  Yeah.
[55:07.590 --> 55:08.710]  I really like this game.
[55:09.350 --> 55:13.930]  I gotta go nurse my poor little dog back to health now that he got his balls removed.
[55:14.750 --> 55:15.770]  He got a lot of work done.
[55:16.050 --> 55:16.490]  He did.
[55:16.730 --> 55:19.530]  He did all his plastic surgery all at once.
[55:20.230 --> 55:20.670]  Damn.
[55:21.090 --> 55:21.750]  Reaper face.
[55:21.750 --> 55:26.270]  We got, uh, because he doesn't go to the gym, but he wants to look to find,
[55:26.370 --> 55:27.330]  we got abs installed.
[55:27.510 --> 55:28.490]  So it looks like he has a six pack.
[55:28.750 --> 55:29.130]  It's pretty nice.
[55:30.670 --> 55:31.690]  We gave him pecs too.
[55:31.970 --> 55:32.990]  So he looks like he's, you know.
[55:33.950 --> 55:35.550]  He's like one of those ripped kangaroos.
[55:35.730 --> 55:36.350]  Yeah, kind of.
[55:36.370 --> 55:37.530]  He looks kind of like a ripped kangaroo.
[55:38.330 --> 55:39.770]  They offer that procedure for humans.
[55:41.210 --> 55:45.790]  I had his chin extended a little bit, kind of like, uh, the dude in Eastbound and Down.
[55:45.950 --> 55:47.110]  So he looks, you know.
[55:48.890 --> 55:51.990]  Like, uh, Jim Carrey and me, myself and Irene.
[55:52.150 --> 55:52.410]  Yes.
[55:54.870 --> 55:55.330]  Huh.
[55:55.590 --> 55:56.330]  What if I...
[55:56.330 --> 55:57.250]  Man, I keep thinking I'm blue.
[55:57.390 --> 55:58.090]  Holy shit.
[55:58.650 --> 55:59.210]  Bet you're not.
[55:59.370 --> 56:00.370]  I keep thinking I'm red.
[56:00.890 --> 56:02.710]  So we're unified.
[56:07.890 --> 56:08.590]  Excuse me.
[56:08.750 --> 56:09.110]  Pardon me.
[56:09.110 --> 56:09.710]  Excuse me.
[56:09.830 --> 56:10.250]  Pardon me.
[56:10.390 --> 56:10.910]  Excuse me.
[56:12.390 --> 56:14.150]  I don't think I'm supposed to be where I was.
[56:14.190 --> 56:17.150]  Maybe blue needs to go to the far left side there.
[56:18.170 --> 56:19.150]  That looks good.
[56:19.610 --> 56:20.570]  Maybe I go there.
[56:20.590 --> 56:22.430]  Then I can go next to him.
[56:22.690 --> 56:24.470]  I can go up the top right.
[56:24.650 --> 56:25.950]  Yeah, I think I see where I go.
[56:26.090 --> 56:26.310]  Yeah.
[56:27.010 --> 56:28.930]  And then once you're there...
[56:28.930 --> 56:29.520]  Maybe I go...
[56:30.450 --> 56:32.210]  No, that's not right.
[56:34.490 --> 56:35.430]  Sounds like you guys...
[56:35.430 --> 56:36.430]  Maybe I go this.
[56:36.610 --> 56:36.890]  Hold on.
[56:36.930 --> 56:37.560]  Maybe I go...
[56:38.670 --> 56:39.290]  Don't move, blue.
[56:39.810 --> 56:40.310]  Oh, okay.
[56:42.770 --> 56:43.630]  God damn it.
[56:44.070 --> 56:44.930]  Okay, there we go.
[56:45.210 --> 56:49.390]  Maybe I spin around and fit that top area.
[56:49.390 --> 56:51.670]  And then you guys just have to make a...
[56:51.670 --> 56:52.470]  Yeah, this is it.
[56:52.550 --> 56:52.910]  This is it.
[56:53.230 --> 56:53.670]  Let me just...
[56:53.670 --> 56:54.750]  I'm just using this to spin around.
[56:54.870 --> 56:56.670]  Don't let me freak out and think I'm doing something wrong.
[56:57.470 --> 56:57.930]  All right.
[56:58.230 --> 57:00.510]  Well, that still leaves that...
[57:00.510 --> 57:01.030]  Now, what do you want?
[57:01.230 --> 57:02.530]  Oh, no, that doesn't work.
[57:02.670 --> 57:05.950]  I think this is all about blue and green figuring out their relationship.
[57:06.730 --> 57:07.050]  Yeah.
[57:07.170 --> 57:07.490]  Yeah.
[57:07.830 --> 57:08.750]  You got to talk it through.
[57:09.730 --> 57:10.370]  That might work.
[57:10.590 --> 57:10.690]  Do that.
[57:10.690 --> 57:12.030]  Oh, that actually might work.
[57:12.510 --> 57:12.850]  Do that.
[57:12.890 --> 57:13.730]  And then I'm gonna go like this.
[57:13.870 --> 57:14.610]  Yeah, come left.
[57:14.710 --> 57:15.170]  Yeah, come down.
[57:15.370 --> 57:15.590]  Come on.
[57:18.860 --> 57:21.760]  Uh, no, I think we've just created the exact same problem.
[57:21.880 --> 57:22.860]  Just a different...
[57:22.860 --> 57:24.380]  Yeah, but what if...
[57:24.380 --> 57:25.240]  What if...
[57:25.240 --> 57:27.320]  But what if it was facing this way this time?
[57:27.920 --> 57:30.420]  What if he spins around on me?
[57:30.740 --> 57:31.860]  Then we have that.
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.140]  That works.
[57:33.480 --> 57:34.620]  Yeah, if he spins around...
[57:35.400 --> 57:35.840]  Right?
[57:37.520 --> 57:38.160]  Excuse me.
[57:38.220 --> 57:38.580]  Pardon me.
[57:38.720 --> 57:39.480]  It works this time.
[57:39.820 --> 57:40.820]  Oh, excuse me.
[57:41.180 --> 57:41.380]  Yeah.
[57:41.480 --> 57:41.760]  Pardon.
[57:41.960 --> 57:42.180]  Yeah.
[57:42.300 --> 57:42.860]  Out the way.
[57:43.040 --> 57:43.260]  Yeah.
[57:44.300 --> 57:44.700]  Bingo.
[57:45.620 --> 57:46.060]  Easy.
[57:46.060 --> 57:47.080]  Bingo, bingo.
[57:47.360 --> 57:48.640]  I'll go bottom left.
[57:50.800 --> 57:52.280]  You say that like you have a choice.
[57:54.160 --> 57:55.840]  There's one place for you to go.
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.520]  I will say Gavin is more comfortable spinning than anybody else.
[57:59.640 --> 58:00.900]  He's definitely got a knack for it.
[58:00.900 --> 58:02.840]  You just wipe yourself for someone at a turn.
[58:02.840 --> 58:04.720]  Everybody understands how to do this.
[58:05.180 --> 58:06.100]  Spinning gets blue!
[58:06.360 --> 58:07.560]  Spinning gets blue, you idiot!
[58:07.900 --> 58:09.100]  I got news for you, Gavin.
[58:09.200 --> 58:11.560]  I understand how to fire a fucking gun in Halo 2.
[58:11.620 --> 58:13.320]  But when I do it, different shit happens.
[58:14.280 --> 58:18.280]  Walk your face into Andrew's face and turn it!
[58:18.580 --> 58:19.220]  No!
[58:19.900 --> 58:21.180]  From the other side!
[58:21.400 --> 58:22.000]  From the...
[58:22.000 --> 58:22.780]  Chin to chin!
[58:23.760 --> 58:24.860]  Running out of time!
[58:25.080 --> 58:25.480]  There you go!
[58:26.580 --> 58:27.360]  5.01!
[58:28.020 --> 58:28.560]  I'm running out of fucking minutes!
[58:29.620 --> 58:30.480]  5.01!
[58:30.860 --> 58:31.740]  What are you doing?
[58:32.140 --> 58:33.620]  It's 5.01!
[58:33.760 --> 58:34.400]  I'm turning!
[58:35.980 --> 58:37.280]  Oh my god.
[58:37.660 --> 58:38.340]  This is it!
[58:41.120 --> 58:41.860]  Nick!
[58:42.500 --> 58:42.740]  I missed it!
[58:42.740 --> 58:43.860]  We're gonna miss 5.01!
[58:44.220 --> 58:44.860]  5.01!
[58:45.240 --> 58:45.880]  5.01!
[58:46.460 --> 58:47.980]  We're done working at 5.01!
[58:48.200 --> 58:49.320]  We timed it perfectly!
[58:49.420 --> 58:50.900]  From this point on, we're dicking around!
[58:52.140 --> 58:53.900]  I still gotta fill the card!
[58:54.320 --> 58:55.020]  Oh god.
[58:55.400 --> 58:55.760]  How many...
[58:55.760 --> 58:57.740]  How much more of the card do we have to go?
[58:58.280 --> 58:59.520]  I don't know, let me look on the shop.
[59:01.800 --> 59:03.340]  I think, like, three more?
[59:09.920 --> 59:11.600]  Let me go buy some stuff.
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.380]  I can buy two things, here.
[59:13.440 --> 59:14.600]  Yeah, me too, yeah.
[59:16.420 --> 59:17.720]  I'll put this back.
[59:17.960 --> 59:18.520]  I got horns.
[59:19.200 --> 59:19.600]  Okay.
[59:19.780 --> 59:20.460]  I got a stripe.
[59:20.980 --> 59:22.080]  Once again, not furniture.
[59:23.420 --> 59:24.600]  Yeah, I need two more...
[59:24.600 --> 59:25.940]  Two more rounds, and then I...
[59:25.940 --> 59:26.700]  Oh, three, three...
[59:26.700 --> 59:27.440]  Three more rounds.
[59:27.580 --> 59:28.960]  Three more rounds, then I got a new, uh...
[59:28.960 --> 59:29.260]  Let's do it.
[59:29.260 --> 59:31.480]  Oh great, I got another fucking nameplate!
[59:33.720 --> 59:37.060]  If anybody wants to trade furniture for nameplates, hit me up.
[59:38.380 --> 59:39.620]  I got a full set.
[59:41.860 --> 59:43.840]  I feel like the real weak link.
[59:43.920 --> 59:48.980]  Man, it's amazing that we timed it so well to end up 5-0-1,
[59:49.140 --> 59:51.400]  but because of Gavin's greed, we're gonna keep it going.
[59:52.540 --> 59:52.940]  Greed.
[59:53.800 --> 59:55.720]  One second, one second, let me move, let me move.
[59:55.780 --> 59:56.900]  I gotta put something in my house.
[59:57.280 --> 59:57.680]  One sec.
[59:58.340 --> 59:59.820]  Sorry, audience, we're, uh...
[59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.600]  We're going into Friday night overtime.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.140]  You guys can't leave yet.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:03.700]  You're not...
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.060]  You're not off the clock just yet.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.760]  Oh, Andrew can make a podcast.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:08.700]  Yeah, I'm...
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.860]  My, uh, watering can is talking away.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:14.560]  Oh, balls.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.740]  Okay, we got four of these.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.860]  Uh, chat, could you let me know if you think Nick's doing a bit or not?
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.140]  It's not...
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:22.340]  Yeah.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:23.780]  It's a bit.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.340]  Nick wants it to be a bit so bad.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.500]  Oh god, I wish it were a bit.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.540]  I like your sweater, Andrew.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.960]  I assume that's what that is.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.300]  Aw, thank you.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.780]  Like a holiday sweater or something?
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.520]  Chat seems to think it's a bit, so I'm going with that.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.260]  Well, it definitely makes you sound less dumb.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.560]  Well, yeah, especially when Gavin's like, go this way, you idiot.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.000]  All right, I put my thing down.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.180]  I put my thing down.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.080]  Uh, I would like to get my thing.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.620]  Don't move there yet, Pink.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.340]  Back up. Back up.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:00.920]  There you go.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.960]  Let's put my thing down again.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.300]  Oh, fuck it.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.720]  Bingo.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.760]  Let's see where I'm supposed to go.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.780]  Okay, I see where I'm supposed to go.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.400]  Then you go there.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.780]  That would have been an impasse.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.500]  Yeah, I was just trying to...
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.220]  God damn it.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:29.680]  Okay.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.360]  Look, look, I'm doing it.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:31.860]  I'm doing it.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.420]  I'm doing it.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:32.960]  I got it.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.880]  I got it.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.020]  Easy.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.100]  Stage clear.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.840]  I was staring at Pink trying to figure it out.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.720]  If I was right.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.500]  Giving it all to Nick.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.820]  All the love to Nick.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.400]  Hey, thank you.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:49.880]  I need it.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.020]  Why are you laughing?
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.460]  I was waiting...
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.220]  Figuring out what Pink was doing.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.480]  Making sure I was right.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.900]  It's so funny in this game when you're in position and every...
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.660]  Like, you're good and you just get to watch.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.580]  It comes with such a feeling of superiority.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.400]  I just start screaming at people.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.420]  Yeah, I've noticed.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.900]  Do you think we're not gonna stop playing this game?
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.220]  Because this is the only time we're truly happy.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.240]  And as soon as we're...
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.960]  It's over and we are done with regulation for the week.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.520]  We have to face our sad, miserable personal lives.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.320]  I used to get bummed out on Friday afternoons when, uh...
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.580]  My early Achievement Hunter days.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.140]  Yeah.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.280]  Because I didn't really have a personal life.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.320]  I just used to wait.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.060]  Should I walk into that?
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:54.500]  Probably.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.940]  Probably how it's gonna go for me.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.020]  Make this work.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.620]  Let me get...
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.060]  Excuse me.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:00.580]  Pardon?
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.820]  Okay, well, that's...
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.260]  Excuse me.
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.580]  Is this for me?
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.200]  Pardon me.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:05.500]  Is this for me?
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.120]  Excuse me.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:06.800]  Okay.
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.220]  Oh, perfect.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.460]  I think blue...
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.460]  No, this is right.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.380]  Yeah, I'm gonna need...
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.480]  Blue and green will be...
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.020]  I'll tell you what, dude.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.000]  Green can move out of the way.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.880]  And here, and by green, I mean me.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.120]  I'm talking to myself in third person.
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.120]  And then blue, you move to the right one.
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:25.840]  Okay.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.980]  And then he can slot right in.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.480]  There you...
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.300]  Well, well, well.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.720]  You gotta smear the wall.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.460]  You just gotta smear the wall, Gavin.
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.080]  Just gotta smear the wall, Gavin.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.400]  Is this a bit?
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.700]  Well, the blue keeps hitting my undercarriage.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.540]  It's never your fault.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.460]  There you go.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:42.880]  Okay.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.000]  See, that's what happens to me every single round.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.560]  It's crazy.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:45.900]  I'll give you a little help.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:46.340]  All right.
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.620]  Thank you.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:47.760]  There you go.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.420]  Rammed him home.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.760]  That actually was a lot of help.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:50.540]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.240]  I got you.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:53.540]  There.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:54.600]  Yeah!
[01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:01.510]  Oh, ClutchMyPearlsPod is here.
[01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:03.150]  Hello, ClutchMyPearlsPod.
[01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:04.230]  Wow, hi.
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.510]  I believe that's probably my wife.
[01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:08.150]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.770]  Because she was like, that's the one time I turned in.
[01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:11.430]  You're talking about how sad your personal life is.
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:12.890]  No, I don't mean me, sweetie.
[01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:14.650]  I just mean, I'm just asking the group.
[01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:17.730]  It was a hypothetical that you happened to catch.
[01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:18.150]  Yeah.
[01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.090]  Only the finest hypothetical.
[01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.430]  It's a hypothetical.
[01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.110]  You don't have to laugh at that.
[01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:28.050]  I like it.
[01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.510]  Puns are good.
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:29.310]  I choose not to.
[01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:30.270]  I got a flower pot!
[01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:32.430]  He got some furniture.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:33.190]  I got furniture!
[01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:35.490]  Dude, put your furniture down.
[01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.470]  Well, I'll do it when after we do that.
[01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:38.730]  It doesn't have to go up right now.
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:39.830]  It's enough to know that I have it.
[01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:40.510]  Another faceplate!
[01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:41.030]  Yay!
[01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.570]  Don't take Albert.
[01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.390]  You have to share custody.
[01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:51.130]  Aw.
[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.970]  Which half of Albert would you want?
[01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.970]  Uh, I don't care.
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.330]  I could make it work.
[01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.410]  I'll take the left side.
[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:01.190]  I'd like to cut him down.
[01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:04.030]  Instead of cutting him face or butt, I just go...
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:04.850]  I'd take the left side.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:08.410]  I was going to say, he's got a lot of face work done, so face could be the way to go.
[01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.730]  Aw, he's so cute.
[01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:17.390]  You remember that Simpsons episode where they're talking to Homer and they're like,
[01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:19.750]  I made this pie, but you know, it's my stuff.
[01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:22.590]  And Homer goes,
[01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:28.350]  Ah, the pie shall be cut in half and each man shall receive death.
[01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:29.870]  I'll eat the pie.
[01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:32.330]  I do not.
[01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.490]  Okay.
[01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.170]  I do remember that one.
[01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.050]  I love it though.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.340]  Surely my wife knows I'm kidding.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.300]  Blue, you can only go at the top.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.020]  Yeah, blue's up top.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.240]  Yeah, blue's up top.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.560]  And then I probably will be right here on the left side.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:56.980]  Yeah.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.120]  Look, look, look, look.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:01.760]  Gavin, look.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:02.520]  Gavin, look.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.900]  I did it, Gavin.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.080]  Nice.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.460]  Can I go here?
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.160]  There we go.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.840]  Everything just snapped into piece.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.640]  Anyway, everybody should listen to Clutch My Pearls.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.400]  It's a podcast about dirty things.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:17.660]  Yeah.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.720]  Come.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.540]  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.640]  Celestial Glorbosis.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.340]  Of peace and poimals, but not so much the poimals.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:30.380]  Yeah.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.360]  Of peace and...
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:34.400]  Ellipses.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.840]  I think we need to do one more and then we'll be able to fill our card.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.100]  I can't wait to see what the free thing is.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.900]  I got a fucking purple flower hat.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:44.480]  Whee!
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.740]  There was a party hat last time for all of us, right?
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:47.200]  Yep.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.060]  Oh, what's it gonna be? Maybe a dild?
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.220]  What?
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.240]  A dild?
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.700]  Is that... a dild?
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.260]  Oh, we're playing this shit again.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.720]  Oh, yes we are.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:03.180]  Match.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:05.720]  All right.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:06.560]  Oh.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.940]  Geoff, you think we're on the same team?
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.200]  It's us again, Gavin.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.200]  We gotta keep the strength.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:10.890]  Yes, I get it.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.180]  All right, Geoff.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:12.840]  We're gonna...
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.220]  All right, Nick.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.060]  We gotta redeem ourselves.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:14.880]  Shit.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.380]  I'm so jealous.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.940]  I want to be the long piece.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.060]  The long piece, I feel like it's a lot easier.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:20.940]  I agree.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.300]  I wish I could be the long piece.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.080]  All right, Nick.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:24.620]  You're the long piece.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.300]  You play defense.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.020]  Okay.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:27.360]  Wait.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:27.940]  Okay.
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:28.900]  Gavin, you're the long piece.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.640]  You play offense.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.040]  Yeah, I'm gonna...
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.240]  Whatever you want to do.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.120]  Oh, it's a giant one.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.280]  Oh, balls.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.560]  Oh, balls.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.480]  I'm scoring on our own goal.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:44.300]  Nick, please don't do that.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.480]  Nick, please don't do that.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:47.180]  No easy shit.
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.700]  Geoff, you gotta score.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.360]  I'm trying, but they're playing defense.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.260]  Okay.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.220]  They weren't doing that last time.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.040]  Get out of here.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.840]  Now, don't sit down, you stupid fool.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.380]  Oh, Andrew.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.540]  Nick's taking the big ball.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.200]  Oh, I'm gonna get the big boy in.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.200]  Yeah!
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:09.540]  No!
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.880]  Geoff, come finish this shit.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:11.500]  Andrew, get it out.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.300]  I'm getting it out.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.100]  Now, I'm carrying it to their side.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.100]  Oh, no.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:16.560]  No!
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:17.760]  You bastard.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.260]  Oh, we're gonna...
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.540]  Go, big balls, big balls, big balls.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.260]  Nick, go, go, go.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:24.480]  That was worth 10 points.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.640]  Nick, we're fucked.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:25.800]  Good lord.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.340]  Nick, we're fucked, buddy.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.040]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:28.540]  We're both.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.540]  We're boned, we're boned, we're boned, we're boned.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.220]  But don't worry about it.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.560]  Stop sitting down.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.880]  Oh, big 10s, big 10s, big 10s.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.840]  Oh, get in another one.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:37.680]  26.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.440]  All right, Nick, we're gonna have to hurt their players.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.220]  You know what?
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.220]  Let's get some red cards and fuck them up.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.740]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.740]  I'm in goal.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.620]  I'm playing defense.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.180]  Help me hit the big bull.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.100]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:56.580]  We're up by 26.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.380]  You already got two of them.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:57.840]  No!
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.700]  Oh, I just missed.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.520]  This blows.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.080]  All right, Nick, I'm gonna get Andrew out of the way.
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.180]  37 to one.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.620]  37 to one.
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.440]  Oh, thank god we didn't stop at 5-0-1 for that.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.780]  That was worth every bit of money.
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.820]  Definitely gonna nick all my hearts.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.480]  Oh, did we just drop down to the lower tier?
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.280]  Yeah, we just got relegated.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.220]  Yeah.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.620]  Man, we gotta do another one, too.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:28.960]  Let's buy.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.420]  I don't have enough to get my star.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.140]  I'm sitting at 61, 62.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:36.440]  But y'all go ahead.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.140]  I'm gonna put my flower pile up.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.860]  Maybe I got paid more handsomely because of the goals.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.140]  Maybe, yeah.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.440]  Yeah, I've got enough now.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.460]  Yeah, I got enough now, too.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.060]  I got a drum set.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.800]  Oh, I also don't have enough.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.360]  Oh, I got the horns.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.800]  That's my second item.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:57.980]  And the thing is...
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.100]  Oh, I got the horns, too.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.340]  Wooly Winterland!
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.260]  Ooh, that sounds nice.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.320]  What's that?
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.520]  Did you unlock a new level?
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.620]  Wooly Winterland selection ticket.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.540]  Is that on here?
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:14.540]  Oh!
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.000]  Oh, we unlocked...
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.300]  So we have plush pines, now you've unlocked Wooly Winterland.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.340]  So can I turn everything off apart from the game?
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:24.440]  From Wooly Winterland?
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.720]  That's to leave the game.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.860]  Oh, I see.
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.400]  All right, let's see what this does.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.620]  Maybe it won't let you, though, because Geoff and I don't have it.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:35.960]  I bet it will.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.360]  Let's see.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.140]  On my way.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.720]  I also selected Wooly.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.040]  Oh, shit!
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:49.720]  It's in there.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.820]  Oh, it's a mix.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.300]  Yes!
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:51.960]  Oh, no!
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:52.660]  Shit!
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.860]  Oh, it's slippery.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.020]  Oh, dude, this is gnarly.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:58.820]  All right, final level.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.720]  Final level.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.140]  What is this thing?
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:01.820]  What is this, a bomb?
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:03.520]  That's what I thought.
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:08.440]  Oh, god.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.760]  I can do this together.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.120]  I'm a space invader.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.200]  I'm a chode.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.960]  Uh, how does...
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:26.860]  What?
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.680]  It's a... it is a bomb.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.260]  What?
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.460]  Is it gonna blow?
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.460]  Ah, shit!
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.960]  What the...
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:41.940]  I don't know.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.400]  What's happening?
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.340]  I can't...
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.620]  What?
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.620]  I can't see a damn thing up here.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.420]  Am I doing it wrong?
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.860]  I don't know what's happening.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.700]  So, okay, so the ball is getting bigger down here, like the more snow it accumulates.
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.480]  Oh, you have to put a snowball in?
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.040]  There we go.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.220]  Get it through, get it through, get it through, get it through.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.240]  Oh, it's going in the water.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.500]  Careful, careful, careful.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:18.860]  I know.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.120]  Oh, no.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:20.940]  Not the water, not the water.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.780]  I see that's the water.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.220]  That may have been me.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.060]  Okay, let's push this guy.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.920]  Oh, shit!
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:30.920]  He pushes back.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:33.300]  Stop making that god dang noise.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.540]  Which noise?
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.320]  Not you, them.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.220]  Push another... I'm getting another snowball.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:39.780]  Oh!
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.860]  Oh, you just wanted me to do it, didn't you?
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.360]  Okay, we're gonna need somebody to hook that snowball back in.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.200]  Okay.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.260]  I would love to.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.880]  Let me see if I can...
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.020]  Oh, this fucking wind.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.280]  Can you sit down and block that thing?
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:59.480]  Oh, that's a good...
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.700]  Here, what if I push it and block it?
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.740]  And what if he comes over?
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.780]  Oh, yeah.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.560]  I think, what if you push it all the way to the right?
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.060]  Then maybe, or let it go left.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:07.880]  Let it go left.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:08.640]  Okay, yeah.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.220]  Oh, all right.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.180]  And then, then, now.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:13.660]  Yeah, all right.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.740]  Now sit down.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.480]  Wedge it in place.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.620]  Sorry, sorry.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:19.780]  Oh, fuck.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.560]  Do we have to start again because the bull's stuck?
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.580]  I...
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.600]  Maybe.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:26.920]  Maybe.
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:29.900]  I can't get it.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.640]  Although maybe if you put the bomb thing in the middle...
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.520]  Gavin, put the bomb down.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.820]  What happens when you put that thing down?
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:36.960]  Put it down.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:37.880]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna get it.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.440]  Bring it to Geoff.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.780]  If Geoff's extended, he can use...
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.380]  That sounded weird.
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:45.120]  If Geoff can, uh, extend into it, maybe he can hit...
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.520]  Excuse me, pardon.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.200]  Andrew, I would like to...
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.360]  I'm trying to get out of your way.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:51.960]  Thank you.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:52.840]  What is that?
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:54.020]  What if I melt the bull?
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:54.800]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.640]  Oh, there it goes.
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.000]  Oh!
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.920]  It's a radiator.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.760]  Oh, I saved us.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.260]  Yay!
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.680]  All right, so what do we do with it now?
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.500]  Because it needs to come past this.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.660]  Yeah, so push the other one to the right.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.060]  I'm gonna move this up.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.720]  I guess I'll stay out of the...
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.740]  How the fuck am I gonna do that?
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.640]  Just push the, the thing and then sit.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.060]  Sit where?
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.340]  Push the thwomp to the right and then sit.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:24.740]  Ah.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:25.600]  I need somebody...
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.540]  I gotta...
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.040]  I need somebody to help me with the stupid ball down here.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.280]  Okay, Andrew can help you, maybe.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.660]  Okay, it's deactivated now.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.260]  I don't think that's how that works, Nick.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:38.880]  What are you talking about?
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:39.500]  It's deactivated.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.100]  I guess you're right.
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:41.320]  Yeah, okay, never mind.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:41.860]  All right, we got...
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.480]  You see a big glowing...
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:43.840]  All right, watch out!
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.100]  No!
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:45.660]  Oh!
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:47.620]  God damn it.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.360]  God damn it.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.920]  Okay, well, let me deactivate this thing.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:54.580]  Ugh.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.140]  All right.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:55.800]  Shit.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.280]  Shit.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:01.900]  Maybe...
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.640]  All right, it's coming towards you, yellow.
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:04.860]  Shit.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.160]  Right, and I'm blocking the thwomp.
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.160]  Okay, I'll just...
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.260]  Yeah, but I'm gonna need you to help.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:09.080]  Yeah, I got you.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:09.860]  Well, now it's gonna get...
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:10.240]  Oh god.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:10.860]  Well...
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.480]  Don't let it...
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.020]  I didn't let...
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.440]  It's okay.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:15.960]  All right, that's not bad.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.280]  Oh look, the wind's helping.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.300]  How the fuck did you deactivate this, Nick?
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.220]  You just...
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.860]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.460]  Which part?
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:26.580]  Oh, you put the...
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.580]  I see, never mind, never mind.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:30.380]  Never mind, I thought you like clicked it into place.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.220]  Oh shit.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.560]  That's for if we need to shrink the ball.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:36.720]  But we shouldn't need to.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.200]  We should be able to just push this through.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:39.900]  All right.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:40.920]  This is too fat for the owl.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.380]  How can that be?
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.240]  It is?
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.160]  Are you saying unless?
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:45.660]  Unless.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:46.660]  Ah.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.740]  I don't think so.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:51.460]  There we go.
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:51.700]  Yes!
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:52.160]  Okay.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.300]  Oh, we got to grab that thing though.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.240]  I'll take the heater.
[01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:00.730]  This...
[01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:01.550]  He's getting complicated.
[01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:03.050]  Shoot myself.
[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:04.470]  There you go.
[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.150]  Drop it.
[01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:06.070]  There you go.
[01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:06.410]  Boom.
[01:16:06.810 --> 01:16:07.430]  Easy peasy.
[01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.390]  Easy peasy.
[01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:13.270]  God.
[01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.110]  Easy peasy.
[01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.530]  Oh no, why did you do that?
[01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:20.710]  I was smearing.
[01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:22.150]  What do you mean?
[01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.570]  I was...
[01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.970]  You're talking to him?
[01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:27.450]  Easy peasy.
[01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:30.630]  I'll be right back.
[01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:34.030]  We have 52 seconds, Gavin.
[01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:35.270]  Gavin!
[01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.950]  Easy peasy.
[01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:43.950]  You can't make me sit down though.
[01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:45.550]  All right.
[01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:46.270]  I'm gonna do a lap.
[01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:46.770]  Check this out.
[01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.070]  We're gonna fail this because of you.
[01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:54.410]  No, we won't.
[01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:57.710]  Good lap.
[01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:01.250]  Is your life already so sad you can't let this in?
[01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.050]  I just don't want to say goodbye.
[01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:08.370]  If I go here, it ends.
[01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.870]  If I go here, it keeps going.
[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:14.710]  What should I do?
[01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:19.050]  Oh, it was so hard.
[01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.090]  All right, bye.
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:24.550]  Stage clear.
[01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:26.170]  We did it.
[01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:31.910]  No hearts for Gavin.
[01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.050]  No hearts for Gavin.
[01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:37.610]  Oh my god.
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:39.470]  What a game.
[01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:40.110]  There you go.
[01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.910]  501520.
[01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:43.990]  Just like every Friday.
[01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:45.430]  The second best time.
[01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.810]  You guys gotta unlock your wintery wonderland.
[01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:49.770]  Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.990]  We should do a sloppy soon, I think.
[01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:53.990]  I think we really should do a sloppy soon.
[01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:56.390]  It's almost, uh, it's almost fantasy fest too.
[01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.950]  When it gets wild.
[01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:00.690]  I got a nickname, of course.
[01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.070]  And my stamp card filled up.
[01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.890]  I also got a nickname.
[01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:05.690]  Woolly Winterland.
[01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.390]  Hell yeah.
[01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:10.190]  All right.
[01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.630]  Well, we should definitely play this again.
[01:18:11.710 --> 01:18:12.450]  This game is pretty fun.
[01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:14.590]  We should keep Eric far away from this game.
[01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:15.110]  We should.
[01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:15.470]  Yeah.
[01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.050]  I just want Eric to play with Nick.
[01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.130]  Hmm, that's okay.
[01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:24.830]  I'm not sure if Nick needs that.
[01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:26.110]  I don't.
[01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:26.430]  Yeah.
[01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:29.330]  No, I don't think anybody needs that.
[01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:32.590]  All right.
[01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:33.370]  Well, end the video.
[01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:34.130]  Yeah.
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:35.790]  Do you want to take us out, Nick?
[01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.190]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:40.050]  Make sure you check out our podcast.
[01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:41.210]  When you started to do it.
[01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.910]  Okay.
[01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.070]  Well, I don't, you know.
[01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:46.490]  We've, uh, we've been going long enough that where there's some pretty good
[01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:48.830]  shit on the old, uh, Patreon these days.
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.990]  So if you haven't signed up, get, get stuck in if you can.
[01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:53.790]  Yeah. And if you can't, that's cool.
[01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:56.870]  We got a ton of free content, uh, as well for you to enjoy.
[01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:58.750]  And it'll still be there when you can.
[01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:01.090]  It'll still be there for the future.
[01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:02.670]  See what I mean? Gavin and I are redundant.
[01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:03.890]  Saying the same shit.
[01:19:04.330 --> 01:19:05.490]  Saying the same shit.
[01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.090]  What?
[01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:07.690]  Regulatrion.com.
[01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.630]  What did you say?
[01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:10.890]  What did I say? Regulatrion?
[01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:12.430]  Geoff thought sucks.
[01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:14.730]  I said the exact same thing you did as you were saying it.
[01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:16.670]  We were just, we were one mind.
[01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:17.870]  No, I know.
[01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:20.490]  But then Nick flubbed Regulatrion by the sounds of it.
[01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.930]  I did?
[01:19:21.370 --> 01:19:21.790]  Didn't you?
[01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:22.390]  What did I do?
[01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:22.890]  I don't think I did.
[01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:23.490]  You didn't sync?
[01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:26.150]  And...
[01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:26.490]  All right.
[01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:27.250]  And bye!
[01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:27.970]  Bye!
