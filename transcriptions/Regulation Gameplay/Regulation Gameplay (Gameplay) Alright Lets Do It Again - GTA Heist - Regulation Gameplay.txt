[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  You already played GTA? See, you like this. That's cool.
[00:03.860 --> 00:05.620]  You think this is good? You like that?
[00:05.720 --> 00:06.580]  What? Don't throw it at me.
[00:06.800 --> 00:07.820]  Don't throw it at me.
[00:08.860 --> 00:10.160]  Throw it right in your rat face.
[00:10.240 --> 00:12.400]  No, don't throw it in my rat face.
[00:12.920 --> 00:14.140]  What are we doing, Geoff?
[00:14.660 --> 00:14.860]  What?
[00:17.060 --> 00:18.200]  Geoff's flying somewhere.
[00:18.320 --> 00:19.580]  His mic is low.
[00:20.340 --> 00:21.220]  Oh, not again.
[00:21.640 --> 00:22.760]  Gavin's kicking my car.
[00:23.240 --> 00:23.860]  Is this your car?
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.040]  Or is it a car you stole?
[00:25.240 --> 00:26.020]  No, it's just a car I stole.
[00:26.520 --> 00:28.220]  OK, well then, what are you worried about?
[00:29.600 --> 00:30.840]  I had some not.
[00:31.120 --> 00:32.440]  It's not like I'm doing this to it.
[00:34.660 --> 00:37.800]  We're members of the same crew, so it didn't kill me.
[00:39.440 --> 00:42.040]  I just, I just lit this.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.460]  Hey, guys, the next time we end a video at the top of Mount Chiliad,
[00:47.500 --> 00:49.560]  will you remind me so I can get down off the mountain?
[00:49.660 --> 00:50.720]  Yeah. To start the next video.
[00:50.720 --> 00:53.340]  I've been playing this for about an hour before you guys got here.
[00:53.620 --> 00:55.700]  So I got down from the mountain pretty easy.
[00:55.820 --> 00:56.540]  I was happy about it.
[00:58.580 --> 00:59.440]  Hop in, son!
[01:04.180 --> 01:05.580]  All right, let's go to Andrew.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.140]  I want to do a test, actually.
[01:07.440 --> 01:08.380]  OK. Oh, if.
[01:08.940 --> 01:09.660]  All right, hold on.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.980]  OK, get back in the passenger seat.
[01:12.260 --> 01:13.880]  I don't think I can. How do you switch?
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.660]  Well, just get out. OK.
[01:17.140 --> 01:18.920]  Get out. You want to blow up your car?
[01:19.620 --> 01:20.740]  Yeah, but you won't die.
[01:21.680 --> 01:22.700]  Do you want me to get on it?
[01:23.420 --> 01:24.820]  You got run over.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.000]  No, no, get in it.
[01:26.400 --> 01:27.720]  Oh, get in it. Get in it.
[01:27.720 --> 01:29.820]  Oh, oh, this is a cool idea.
[01:30.040 --> 01:31.220]  OK, let's do it.
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.960]  And we'll see how far you go.
[01:34.100 --> 01:35.340]  Yeah, I like this.
[01:35.940 --> 01:36.980]  We got to find, like, a ramp.
[01:38.980 --> 01:39.160]  Oops.
[01:39.720 --> 01:40.020]  Pfft.
[01:41.380 --> 01:42.680]  You just killed that guy.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.480]  They're dead now.
[01:46.800 --> 01:48.020]  Andrew, where should we be going?
[01:48.620 --> 01:50.560]  What if we did a game of...
[01:50.560 --> 01:51.820]  What's that taxi quiz show?
[01:52.980 --> 01:53.460]  Cash Cab?
[01:54.380 --> 01:55.040]  Cash Cab.
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.200]  But if you get a wrong answer...
[01:56.200 --> 01:58.420]  Oh, it killed me.
[01:59.720 --> 02:00.780]  Oh, I died.
[02:01.420 --> 02:04.000]  Oh, Gavin died and Gavin killed an associate.
[02:06.320 --> 02:08.200]  Hopefully it costs you money, you son of a bitch.
[02:08.540 --> 02:09.660]  So you can't kill an associate.
[02:10.060 --> 02:12.820]  Yeah, you can. I'm just flying back to the apartment to start the heist.
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.740]  OK, do we have to be there also or are you just like...
[02:15.740 --> 02:18.280]  I think I can just pull you in now that we're cool.
[02:19.720 --> 02:21.000]  Nick, are you still on the mountain or what?
[02:21.460 --> 02:23.420]  Yeah, I'm on the mountain trying to find that car.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.120]  Car?
[02:25.320 --> 02:26.040]  Oh, the ghost car?
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.380]  I want the ghost car.
[02:27.460 --> 02:28.420]  Where do I get the ghost car?
[02:28.640 --> 02:29.760]  Is the ghost car on the mountain?
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.220]  No, but I am.
[02:33.440 --> 02:34.620]  OK, so I don't understand.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.400]  Is the car delivered to the mountain?
[02:37.240 --> 02:39.420]  The car is probably in your phone.
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.680]  So unless you can't get reception on the mountain,
[02:44.760 --> 02:47.040]  I don't really see how the mountain...
[02:47.040 --> 02:48.640]  No, it is in the middle of nowhere.
[02:48.720 --> 02:51.140]  I don't I don't understand what the mountain has to do with this, I guess.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.100]  I'm on it.
[02:54.100 --> 02:55.820]  I think he's just unhappy about it.
[02:55.880 --> 02:58.240]  I don't think it has anything to actually do with it.
[02:58.320 --> 03:01.380]  But he said, well, he's on the mountain to get the car here.
[03:01.500 --> 03:03.360]  Did you know that he can save whenever he wants?
[03:04.940 --> 03:06.920]  I know that. Does he know that?
[03:07.460 --> 03:08.680]  He does now.
[03:10.400 --> 03:11.720]  No, I'm just waiting for
[03:12.720 --> 03:15.420]  for Andrew to suck me into the planning room.
[03:15.740 --> 03:19.140]  Well, and while I'm doing that, I'm trying to buy a car.
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.320]  Yeah, suck me up, bud.
[03:21.820 --> 03:22.860]  Yeah, I'm excited for the suck.
[03:22.860 --> 03:24.580]  That was the coolest thing about
[03:25.940 --> 03:28.760]  playing with Rockstar, is that they use that like
[03:30.260 --> 03:33.280]  developer controls on the online lobby so they could just
[03:33.280 --> 03:36.700]  at the click of a button, just pull you into whatever they want
[03:36.700 --> 03:38.020]  without you pressing anything.
[03:38.500 --> 03:41.460]  Damn, that sounds like something that should be available to me,
[03:41.500 --> 03:43.060]  a person who's just playing the video game.
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.900]  You can just pull any game or tag into your lobby.
[03:45.920 --> 03:47.120]  Yeah, I just want in.
[03:47.980 --> 03:49.600]  Oh, oh, oh.
[03:50.440 --> 03:50.880]  Shit.
[03:50.880 --> 03:53.080]  OK, well, hi, Andrew.
[03:53.580 --> 03:55.680]  Hey. OK, bye, Andrew.
[03:56.080 --> 03:59.680]  Bye. Hey, there it is.
[04:00.980 --> 04:01.460]  Oops.
[04:02.840 --> 04:03.680]  What's oops?
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.300]  I just pressed A on a bunch of stuff.
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.060]  I think I just paid Lester for my wanted level.
[04:11.200 --> 04:13.460]  See, that's how you get sucked out of a game.
[04:13.940 --> 04:16.260]  I haven't noticed a place to change difficulty.
[04:17.140 --> 04:17.620]  Interesting.
[04:18.360 --> 04:20.360]  Oh, oh, oh, I think, yeah.
[04:21.500 --> 04:22.540]  It'll do it after this.
[04:26.710 --> 04:27.950]  I don't know if we got a car.
[04:28.050 --> 04:28.970]  I think we just got outfits.
[04:33.630 --> 04:35.030]  Do we have to listen to Lester talk?
[04:35.270 --> 04:35.410]  Yep.
[04:36.650 --> 04:36.970]  Get it.
[04:38.950 --> 04:42.270]  Is this the end of another heist?
[04:43.250 --> 04:43.910]  It's the start.
[04:44.010 --> 04:45.150]  The start of a new one.
[04:45.830 --> 04:46.350]  That's fine.
[04:46.870 --> 04:48.490]  This is the last heist.
[04:49.270 --> 04:49.630]  What?
[04:49.970 --> 04:51.190]  Is this the last original?
[04:51.490 --> 04:53.110]  Is this on the end of the last part, though?
[04:53.110 --> 04:53.210]  Yeah.
[04:54.810 --> 04:57.990]  Because wasn't our heist like a 20 minute segment in a new video?
[04:58.550 --> 04:59.550]  I have no idea.
[05:01.330 --> 05:03.150]  That was months ago.
[05:03.750 --> 05:04.190]  Are you all right?
[05:04.590 --> 05:05.390]  I'm great.
[05:06.170 --> 05:07.490]  I doesn't want to be heisting.
[05:07.570 --> 05:07.990]  You can tell.
[05:08.170 --> 05:09.750]  No, I don't know how.
[05:09.950 --> 05:11.070]  I don't.
[05:11.130 --> 05:12.150]  Is that true?
[05:12.290 --> 05:12.950]  I don't know.
[05:13.250 --> 05:13.550]  I don't.
[05:13.630 --> 05:18.690]  Well, I remember we were doing it in parts and then the final part was a new recording,
[05:18.770 --> 05:19.630]  but it was so short.
[05:20.470 --> 05:22.070]  Maybe it's just a little baby heist.
[05:23.110 --> 05:23.470]  Hmm.
[05:25.150 --> 05:25.670]  Okay.
[05:26.130 --> 05:26.530]  All right.
[05:27.310 --> 05:28.590]  Or we can take it on this.
[05:28.690 --> 05:29.330]  I don't know.
[05:30.070 --> 05:30.510]  Hold on.
[05:30.570 --> 05:30.890]  Let's see.
[05:31.050 --> 05:32.570]  GTA Heist 9.
[05:32.830 --> 05:33.210]  Uh-huh.
[05:33.830 --> 05:34.690]  Overly leveraged.
[05:34.850 --> 05:35.290]  Nine.
[05:36.130 --> 05:37.230]  Yeah, number nine.
[05:37.570 --> 05:38.150]  Oh my God.
[05:38.610 --> 05:40.210]  This would come out this year.
[05:41.230 --> 05:42.630]  Welcome to 2025.
[05:42.990 --> 05:44.990]  Thank you guys so much for watching us heist.
[05:45.530 --> 05:46.990]  Has Nick worn the mask yet?
[05:47.050 --> 05:47.510]  Who knows?
[05:48.870 --> 05:50.090]  Oh, good question.
[05:50.690 --> 05:51.210]  Transponder.
[05:51.630 --> 05:54.310]  We need our transponder to blimp out.
[05:54.310 --> 05:58.650]  Oh, we did one of the jobs after that.
[06:00.250 --> 06:01.310]  What is the jobs?
[06:01.430 --> 06:01.830]  What do you mean?
[06:01.870 --> 06:02.410]  What does that mean?
[06:02.530 --> 06:05.390]  I think we captured a big dude.
[06:05.390 --> 06:06.010]  Oh, we arrested somebody?
[06:06.610 --> 06:07.570]  Yeah, we arrested somebody.
[06:07.570 --> 06:10.030]  Oh, we did one of the in-between things.
[06:11.230 --> 06:11.630]  Yeah.
[06:11.970 --> 06:12.190]  Okay.
[06:12.550 --> 06:12.950]  Okay.
[06:13.290 --> 06:14.330]  Don't know why you were...
[06:14.330 --> 06:16.450]  You seem timid in answering that.
[06:16.890 --> 06:19.810]  Well, because it was a heist and then it was an in-between the heist in the same video.
[06:21.210 --> 06:23.490]  Okay, but that answers all of our questions, doesn't it?
[06:25.450 --> 06:26.010]  Yes.
[06:27.350 --> 06:28.590]  I'm on the mountain.
[06:32.650 --> 06:34.330]  Has Nick always been like this?
[06:34.570 --> 06:35.150]  Dude, no.
[06:35.250 --> 06:36.230]  It has gotten worse.
[06:39.210 --> 06:41.310]  I haven't been sleeping much lately.
[06:41.730 --> 06:42.510]  That's understandable.
[06:43.090 --> 06:43.790]  Oh, man.
[06:46.190 --> 06:48.150]  Nick's last name for a second.
[06:49.490 --> 06:51.010]  Let's go get some vans.
[06:51.830 --> 06:53.070]  We're stealing vans?
[06:55.130 --> 06:55.690]  Hard.
[06:55.910 --> 06:56.890]  Okay, here we go.
[06:57.250 --> 06:58.330]  Difficulty hard.
[06:58.770 --> 07:00.330]  Let's do this goddamn thing.
[07:00.790 --> 07:02.510]  We got to disable the die packs.
[07:03.270 --> 07:03.550]  Okay.
[07:03.970 --> 07:04.210]  Oh.
[07:04.410 --> 07:05.750]  You'll photograph a few vans.
[07:06.030 --> 07:06.590]  Okay.
[07:07.190 --> 07:09.810]  And in the field to identify the right one.
[07:10.290 --> 07:10.610]  Sweet.
[07:10.950 --> 07:11.790]  Let's do this.
[07:11.790 --> 07:12.210]  Let's do it.
[07:13.010 --> 07:15.090]  Oh, drivers, navigators.
[07:15.570 --> 07:16.270]  Oh, I'm going.
[07:16.490 --> 07:17.230]  I'm navigating.
[07:18.330 --> 07:18.570]  Okay.
[07:18.730 --> 07:19.610]  I mean, I'll drive.
[07:19.670 --> 07:20.050]  I don't care.
[07:20.050 --> 07:20.690]  All right.
[07:20.710 --> 07:21.330]  Let's go on Andrew.
[07:21.690 --> 07:22.250]  Keep tape.
[07:23.450 --> 07:23.870]  Oh, yeah.
[07:23.870 --> 07:25.330]  I don't think they're going to have that for us.
[07:25.430 --> 07:26.330]  I think it's just going to be here.
[07:26.450 --> 07:26.870]  We got to hang out.
[07:26.910 --> 07:27.330]  We got to match.
[07:27.410 --> 07:28.190]  We should both wear hats.
[07:29.790 --> 07:30.750]  Tourists, the traveler.
[07:31.450 --> 07:32.550]  We'll match as tourists.
[07:32.710 --> 07:32.950]  Uh-huh.
[07:34.330 --> 07:35.070]  We're day tripping.
[07:35.330 --> 07:38.130]  We are day tripping so hard, Nick.
[07:39.770 --> 07:40.930]  No bad ideas, baby.
[07:41.090 --> 07:41.530]  No bad.
[07:41.670 --> 07:43.550]  We kind of look like the dude a little bit.
[07:45.310 --> 07:45.950]  Oh, okay.
[07:46.030 --> 07:46.650]  I'm ready.
[07:47.710 --> 07:48.030]  Okay.
[07:48.030 --> 07:50.570]  I like a white rush.
[07:51.470 --> 07:52.350]  Oh, wow.
[07:52.430 --> 07:53.470]  We're matching teams.
[07:53.750 --> 07:54.470]  This is great.
[07:56.790 --> 07:57.230]  Okay.
[07:57.410 --> 07:57.990]  We got two drivers.
[07:58.150 --> 07:58.230]  All right.
[07:58.230 --> 07:58.750]  Who's with me?
[07:59.930 --> 08:01.730]  Somebody want to drive my armored car?
[08:01.950 --> 08:03.470]  I'm going to drive my burger car.
[08:06.010 --> 08:06.670]  All right.
[08:06.670 --> 08:07.270]  Here we go.
[08:07.490 --> 08:07.910]  Where to?
[08:08.010 --> 08:10.530]  The navigator will guide you towards the vans using voice chat.
[08:10.610 --> 08:12.410]  So Andrew doesn't understand what we're doing.
[08:12.870 --> 08:13.710]  Is that what's going on?
[08:13.790 --> 08:15.230]  I was just trying to back up.
[08:16.370 --> 08:17.330]  Nick, what are you doing?
[08:17.330 --> 08:18.450]  I'll drive myself.
[08:18.770 --> 08:21.530]  I need a navigator.
[08:21.530 --> 08:22.550]  You're a navigator.
[08:22.710 --> 08:23.390]  You dunce.
[08:24.870 --> 08:25.470]  All right.
[08:25.710 --> 08:27.910]  So how do I use trackify?
[08:28.490 --> 08:29.430]  Andrew, are you a navigator?
[08:29.810 --> 08:30.810]  I'm navigating.
[08:31.190 --> 08:31.570]  All right.
[08:31.670 --> 08:32.150]  Navigate me.
[08:32.490 --> 08:32.750]  Trackify.
[08:32.970 --> 08:33.410]  Okay.
[08:35.850 --> 08:36.830]  Oh, God.
[08:36.970 --> 08:37.830]  Oh, God.
[08:37.830 --> 08:38.170]  Okay.
[08:38.270 --> 08:39.170]  So go left.
[08:39.530 --> 08:40.990]  Where am I going, Nick?
[08:41.170 --> 08:42.310]  Just mark it, mark it.
[08:42.430 --> 08:43.170]  No, I can't.
[08:43.170 --> 08:43.770]  I can't.
[08:43.770 --> 08:44.670]  You can't mark it.
[08:45.150 --> 08:46.990]  What color is it, Andrew, that we're looking for?
[08:47.330 --> 08:48.330]  The red dot.
[08:50.630 --> 08:52.510]  You can't just put a mark on a map.
[08:52.510 --> 08:52.850]  No!
[08:54.370 --> 08:56.030]  Nick, talk to me.
[08:56.990 --> 08:57.290]  Hold on.
[08:57.370 --> 08:58.750]  I'm trying to figure out what we're looking for.
[08:58.890 --> 08:58.950]  Okay.
[08:59.030 --> 09:00.070]  So we're looking for these red dots.
[09:00.170 --> 09:00.270]  All right.
[09:00.310 --> 09:01.610]  Coming up here on the left.
[09:01.710 --> 09:03.170]  This guy driving right past us right now.
[09:03.170 --> 09:03.930]  That right there?
[09:04.570 --> 09:04.750]  Yeah.
[09:04.850 --> 09:06.430]  Take a photo of the license plate.
[09:06.730 --> 09:07.950]  Okay, that'll be you.
[09:08.310 --> 09:09.630]  Go left.
[09:09.930 --> 09:10.290]  Okay.
[09:11.570 --> 09:12.230]  On the highway?
[09:12.630 --> 09:13.930]  Just the next left.
[09:14.210 --> 09:14.570]  Got it.
[09:14.710 --> 09:15.050]  You got it?
[09:15.130 --> 09:15.270]  Okay.
[09:15.430 --> 09:15.730]  Now where?
[09:15.810 --> 09:16.010]  Yep.
[09:16.110 --> 09:16.350]  All right.
[09:16.350 --> 09:18.030]  Now let's go look for another one.
[09:18.190 --> 09:18.270]  Yep.
[09:18.390 --> 09:18.510]  All right.
[09:18.570 --> 09:19.270]  Turn right up here.
[09:19.310 --> 09:19.870]  Turn right.
[09:20.010 --> 09:20.770]  You got it.
[09:20.810 --> 09:22.470]  I think this is the one where for achievement.
[09:22.550 --> 09:23.210]  What happened?
[09:24.110 --> 09:25.250]  What just happened?
[09:27.790 --> 09:28.190]  Nice.
[09:29.510 --> 09:31.590]  It ran into me.
[09:31.890 --> 09:34.090]  I mean, you turned in front of him, but full speed.
[09:34.330 --> 09:34.670]  It ran into...
[09:34.670 --> 09:35.810]  You have to be done by 1.30.
[09:36.330 --> 09:39.710]  It ran into me.
[09:42.290 --> 09:43.670]  What do you mean no?
[09:43.990 --> 09:44.470]  It ran into me.
[09:44.470 --> 09:46.210]  I mean, you turned in front of him, Eric.
[09:47.170 --> 09:48.770]  Who ran into who?
[09:50.630 --> 09:51.430]  Thank you.
[09:51.510 --> 09:56.230]  But if I slam on my brakes and the person behind me is not paying attention.
[09:56.550 --> 09:56.910]  Oh, wait.
[09:57.050 --> 09:57.170]  Yep.
[09:57.270 --> 09:57.430]  Okay.
[09:57.510 --> 09:57.830]  Fair enough.
[09:57.950 --> 09:58.190]  Okay.
[09:58.310 --> 10:00.150]  So shut up forever.
[10:01.150 --> 10:01.910]  Now you're wrong.
[10:03.170 --> 10:07.010]  This is what happens when you separate Team No Bad Ideas and Team Tape.
[10:08.190 --> 10:08.590]  Animosity.
[10:09.550 --> 10:11.570]  Yeah, we really blew it, I think.
[10:12.470 --> 10:13.010]  Well, you did.
[10:13.770 --> 10:14.070]  All right.
[10:14.530 --> 10:15.550]  All right, here we go.
[10:15.550 --> 10:16.730]  Okay, you left again.
[10:16.950 --> 10:17.310]  All right, turn around.
[10:17.430 --> 10:17.630]  I'm just assuming.
[10:17.730 --> 10:17.870]  Left.
[10:19.070 --> 10:21.110]  Go down that little street right here.
[10:21.210 --> 10:21.350]  Okay.
[10:21.950 --> 10:24.750]  There is one coming up on the left side.
[10:24.890 --> 10:25.770]  Go down that street.
[10:25.990 --> 10:26.430]  Down this one?
[10:26.450 --> 10:26.530]  Right.
[10:26.750 --> 10:27.110]  There you go.
[10:27.250 --> 10:27.390]  Yep.
[10:28.630 --> 10:28.990]  Straight.
[10:29.330 --> 10:32.750]  Oh, you hit a guy that looked like our car.
[10:32.750 --> 10:33.270]  All right, keep going straight.
[10:33.350 --> 10:33.770]  Keep going straight.
[10:33.810 --> 10:34.890]  He was dressed as our car.
[10:35.010 --> 10:35.450]  You hit him.
[10:36.910 --> 10:37.270]  And...
[10:37.270 --> 10:38.730]  He was cosplaying us and I ran him over.
[10:40.050 --> 10:40.770]  Okay, turn.
[10:41.170 --> 10:42.710]  So now we're cosplaying as him.
[10:44.910 --> 10:46.490]  I hope we're going to the same one.
[10:46.490 --> 10:47.190]  Just keep going straight.
[10:47.430 --> 10:47.750]  And I think...
[10:48.490 --> 10:49.790]  Keep going straight.
[10:51.190 --> 10:51.910]  Okay, perfect.
[10:52.670 --> 10:53.810]  So this one in Sheep and Hunter,
[10:53.970 --> 10:56.890]  we had one team talking in a high voice and one team talking in a low voice.
[10:57.570 --> 10:58.770]  Pick a left.
[10:59.390 --> 11:00.070]  Go left.
[11:00.610 --> 11:02.030]  At your next availability.
[11:02.530 --> 11:03.270]  The next left?
[11:03.570 --> 11:04.510]  Where do you want me to go?
[11:05.010 --> 11:05.710]  Keep going straight.
[11:05.830 --> 11:05.950]  Okay.
[11:06.210 --> 11:06.810]  Keep going straight.
[11:08.110 --> 11:09.450]  Are we going to the same van?
[11:10.350 --> 11:11.290]  No, I don't think so.
[11:11.390 --> 11:11.590]  Okay.
[11:12.170 --> 11:12.950]  Keep going straight.
[11:13.070 --> 11:13.810]  I'm doing fucking...
[11:13.810 --> 11:14.330]  Uh, go left.
[11:14.630 --> 11:15.170]  Uh, yeah.
[11:15.330 --> 11:17.090]  This is a terrible tracking system.
[11:17.310 --> 11:18.050]  So we are going to the same van.
[11:18.050 --> 11:18.290]  Yeah, go left.
[11:18.590 --> 11:19.770]  The tracking thing sucks.
[11:21.010 --> 11:21.450]  Turn right.
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.210]  And then hang a right.
[11:22.410 --> 11:23.210]  And then let me guess.
[11:23.310 --> 11:23.910]  First left?
[11:23.910 --> 11:24.530]  Turn left.
[11:24.710 --> 11:24.890]  Yeah.
[11:25.190 --> 11:25.490]  Turn left.
[11:25.530 --> 11:26.050]  Is this the right way?
[11:26.410 --> 11:26.530]  Yeah.
[11:26.690 --> 11:26.710]  Okay.
[11:26.850 --> 11:27.330]  Just keep going straight.
[11:27.370 --> 11:27.570]  It is.
[11:27.650 --> 11:28.570]  We're going to the same van.
[11:28.570 --> 11:29.070]  Keep going straight.
[11:29.690 --> 11:30.710]  I don't think we are.
[11:31.270 --> 11:32.330]  We are going.
[11:32.730 --> 11:34.110]  How do you change the van?
[11:39.930 --> 11:40.670]  Okay, wait.
[11:40.770 --> 11:41.350]  Turn around, turn around.
[11:42.330 --> 11:43.070]  Turn left, turn left.
[11:43.170 --> 11:44.230]  Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[11:44.530 --> 11:45.470]  We might be going to the same van.
[11:45.570 --> 11:45.790]  They're moving.
[11:46.230 --> 11:46.350]  Uh...
[11:46.350 --> 11:46.690]  Oh, yeah!
[11:46.790 --> 11:48.210]  Take a right, take a right, take a right.
[11:48.670 --> 11:49.450]  What do you want me to do?
[11:51.190 --> 11:51.470]  Uh...
[11:52.210 --> 11:53.070]  Turn right, turn right.
[11:53.510 --> 11:53.790]  Turn right.
[11:54.030 --> 11:54.690]  Turn right?
[11:55.490 --> 11:56.470]  Okay, take your next.
[11:57.330 --> 11:57.890]  Uh, left?
[12:00.410 --> 12:01.090]  And then, uh...
[12:02.850 --> 12:04.150]  Okay, right there, right there, right there.
[12:04.190 --> 12:05.510]  There's the van, there's the van, there's the van.
[12:06.190 --> 12:07.190]  It's parked next to us.
[12:07.310 --> 12:08.050]  Yeah, that van.
[12:08.130 --> 12:08.370]  This one?
[12:09.010 --> 12:10.150]  Yeah, take a photo of that van.
[12:12.830 --> 12:13.150]  Okay.
[12:13.150 --> 12:13.730]  You can take the photo.
[12:13.930 --> 12:14.170]  Oh, I can't?
[12:14.170 --> 12:15.310]  Turn right, turn right, turn right.
[12:15.350 --> 12:16.090]  Line me up, line me up.
[12:16.150 --> 12:16.470]  Turn right?
[12:16.610 --> 12:16.730]  Turn left to the plate.
[12:17.270 --> 12:17.830]  Yeah, turn right.
[12:18.210 --> 12:19.150]  I need to see that plate.
[12:20.230 --> 12:20.870]  Get a zoom on it.
[12:21.390 --> 12:21.470]  Got it.
[12:21.470 --> 12:21.730]  Fill the frame.
[12:21.730 --> 12:21.990]  Got it.
[12:22.570 --> 12:22.890]  Nice.
[12:23.310 --> 12:23.630]  Okay.
[12:24.490 --> 12:24.810]  Uh...
[12:26.930 --> 12:27.250]  Uh...
[12:27.250 --> 12:27.830]  Keep going straight.
[12:27.910 --> 12:28.250]  Go right.
[12:28.350 --> 12:28.550]  Go straight.
[12:28.550 --> 12:31.310]  Oh, Nick is still doing this fucking low voice talking?
[12:31.670 --> 12:32.350]  Oh, my God.
[12:34.070 --> 12:34.670]  I'm helping.
[12:36.570 --> 12:36.890]  Uh...
[12:38.350 --> 12:39.430]  Turn left up here.
[12:39.530 --> 12:39.850]  Okay.
[12:40.230 --> 12:41.690]  We'll see if we get any closer.
[12:41.810 --> 12:43.310]  Sorry, this thing is really...
[12:44.090 --> 12:46.230]  I'm not worried about your navigating.
[12:46.470 --> 12:48.030]  I just need you to talk to me.
[12:49.270 --> 12:51.990]  Once you take a left now down this street...
[12:52.790 --> 12:54.030]  All right, turn right up here.
[12:54.290 --> 12:55.990]  And just go straight for a while.
[12:56.070 --> 12:56.930]  We'll leave these with them.
[12:57.850 --> 12:58.090]  Okay.
[12:58.330 --> 12:59.050]  Yeah, we're coming up.
[12:59.710 --> 13:01.790]  It's lined up on this road, but it's going right.
[13:02.110 --> 13:03.210]  So we're going to keep going straight.
[13:03.330 --> 13:03.710]  Keep going straight.
[13:04.630 --> 13:05.790]  Keep going straight.
[13:05.790 --> 13:06.110]  Okay.
[13:07.510 --> 13:08.010]  Going straight.
[13:08.010 --> 13:08.430]  Is that a van?
[13:08.490 --> 13:08.890]  It's a van.
[13:08.890 --> 13:09.830]  I think we're coming up on it.
[13:09.830 --> 13:10.530]  It's a van up here.
[13:10.630 --> 13:11.270]  Yeah, that's it.
[13:11.470 --> 13:11.930]  I see it.
[13:12.190 --> 13:13.050]  I'll get close.
[13:13.770 --> 13:15.230]  I'll get close and then I'll bail off it.
[13:16.730 --> 13:17.370]  Uh, okay.
[13:17.450 --> 13:17.810]  You got that?
[13:17.910 --> 13:18.050]  All right.
[13:18.070 --> 13:18.470]  I got a picture.
[13:18.610 --> 13:18.930]  I got it.
[13:19.090 --> 13:19.210]  Okay.
[13:19.230 --> 13:20.730]  Well, they just took the one we were going to.
[13:20.930 --> 13:21.490]  So turn around.
[13:21.710 --> 13:21.750]  Okay.
[13:21.790 --> 13:22.010]  Perfect.
[13:22.190 --> 13:23.190]  Turn around.
[13:26.310 --> 13:27.030]  Turn left.
[13:27.270 --> 13:27.490]  Okay.
[13:28.350 --> 13:28.970]  When you can.
[13:29.170 --> 13:29.370]  Yep.
[13:29.850 --> 13:31.090]  Let's go back the way we came.
[13:31.930 --> 13:32.350]  Oh, hey.
[13:35.010 --> 13:35.590]  What the?
[13:35.690 --> 13:38.750]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:38.750 --> 13:40.250]  Oh, boy.
[13:45.150 --> 13:46.290]  Oh, get him.
[13:46.290 --> 13:46.350]  Get him.
[13:46.390 --> 13:46.630]  Get him.
[13:46.670 --> 13:47.930]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[13:48.150 --> 13:48.610]  Oh, that actually.
[13:49.770 --> 13:50.170]  Go.
[13:50.330 --> 13:50.610]  Go left.
[13:50.810 --> 13:51.090]  Go straight.
[13:51.350 --> 13:51.750]  Go left.
[13:52.550 --> 13:53.170]  What did you say?
[13:53.210 --> 13:53.410]  Right?
[13:53.610 --> 13:53.970]  Straight.
[13:54.250 --> 13:54.650]  Straight.
[13:54.850 --> 13:55.370]  Turn around, Eric.
[13:55.450 --> 13:55.690]  Turn around.
[13:55.850 --> 13:57.290]  I told you I'd start recording by accident.
[13:57.990 --> 13:58.490]  You what?
[13:59.050 --> 13:59.650]  You what?
[14:00.110 --> 14:00.830]  I hit actually.
[14:00.850 --> 14:01.870]  And then go left at this light.
[14:02.170 --> 14:02.650]  Left here?
[14:02.810 --> 14:02.970]  Okay.
[14:03.370 --> 14:03.570]  Yeah.
[14:04.150 --> 14:04.550]  Yeah.
[14:05.450 --> 14:06.270]  Let me get around this bus.
[14:06.270 --> 14:07.050]  Mm-hmm.
[14:07.990 --> 14:08.570]  Are we good?
[14:08.690 --> 14:09.030]  All right.
[14:09.310 --> 14:10.630]  We're going to go straight.
[14:10.790 --> 14:11.390]  We're going straight.
[14:11.490 --> 14:12.290]  We're getting away from it.
[14:12.290 --> 14:13.570]  We're going to turn right.
[14:14.290 --> 14:14.710]  Not yet.
[14:14.830 --> 14:15.010]  Not yet.
[14:15.070 --> 14:16.170]  Across the bridge, turn right.
[14:16.350 --> 14:16.470]  Okay.
[14:19.710 --> 14:20.310]  Yeah, up here.
[14:20.590 --> 14:21.130]  Keep going straight.
[14:21.450 --> 14:22.390]  That's what I'm looking for.
[14:22.530 --> 14:22.830]  That's...
[14:22.830 --> 14:23.850]  I don't know why you didn't keep...
[14:27.750 --> 14:28.070]  Okay.
[14:28.230 --> 14:29.790]  Turn left here.
[14:30.770 --> 14:33.110]  Sorry, you were flying.
[14:33.630 --> 14:33.910]  You're fine.
[14:34.730 --> 14:35.050]  Okay.
[14:35.110 --> 14:35.630]  That was a move.
[14:35.630 --> 14:38.770]  And then it should be coming up here on the right somewhere.
[14:38.950 --> 14:39.470]  Do you want me to turn?
[14:39.590 --> 14:39.870]  Keep going straight for now.
[14:39.890 --> 14:40.270]  A little shim.
[14:40.290 --> 14:41.250]  No, keep going straight for now.
[14:41.430 --> 14:41.530]  Okay.
[14:41.830 --> 14:42.710]  Yeah, now we go straight.
[14:44.130 --> 14:46.610]  Now I know how this thing operates here.
[14:46.630 --> 14:46.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:46.990 --> 14:47.490]  Just keep going.
[14:47.910 --> 14:48.870]  Just a little bit further.
[14:49.010 --> 14:49.650]  Yeah, keep going.
[14:49.750 --> 14:50.190]  Keep going.
[14:50.310 --> 14:51.010]  Okay, it's pinging.
[14:51.270 --> 14:52.050]  I got my eyes...
[14:52.050 --> 14:52.850]  Oh, oh, I see it.
[14:52.910 --> 14:53.110]  I see it.
[14:53.150 --> 14:53.390]  I see it.
[14:53.870 --> 14:54.490]  Okay, now left.
[14:54.510 --> 14:55.670]  Yeah, it's up ahead.
[14:56.030 --> 14:56.150]  All right.
[14:56.190 --> 14:56.430]  It's up ahead.
[14:56.610 --> 14:56.770]  Ready?
[14:57.590 --> 14:58.170]  I got it.
[14:58.230 --> 14:58.570]  Get your camera.
[14:58.750 --> 15:00.090]  Yeah, getting it out right now.
[15:00.850 --> 15:01.130]  And...
[15:01.130 --> 15:01.470]  Got it?
[15:01.490 --> 15:01.770]  Got it.
[15:01.770 --> 15:02.230]  Let's go.
[15:02.890 --> 15:03.250]  Okay.
[15:03.410 --> 15:04.930]  Let's see if we can beat them to the last one.
[15:07.150 --> 15:07.510]  Turn.
[15:08.310 --> 15:09.050]  Turn right here.
[15:09.410 --> 15:10.070]  There it is, there it is, there it is.
[15:10.890 --> 15:11.770]  Ah, it sounds like they got it.
[15:12.910 --> 15:13.670]  Well, they haven't done it.
[15:13.730 --> 15:14.630]  Oh, we've got blockage.
[15:16.470 --> 15:16.910]  Get in!
[15:18.610 --> 15:19.550]  Oh, oh, oh.
[15:19.570 --> 15:20.530]  Did you almost...
[15:20.530 --> 15:21.250]  Did you almost hit it?
[15:21.370 --> 15:22.670]  Oh, he was so close.
[15:22.950 --> 15:24.150]  Yeah, they don't want you to do that.
[15:25.390 --> 15:27.170]  Man, you snapped that picture quick.
[15:27.390 --> 15:28.910]  It's like we were about to hit him.
[15:29.970 --> 15:30.710]  That was terrifying.
[15:32.090 --> 15:33.050]  All right, what are we doing now?
[15:33.190 --> 15:35.210]  Are we going to wait for Lester to do something?
[15:35.710 --> 15:36.230]  Oh, there we go.
[15:36.350 --> 15:37.330]  Okay, putting a marker down for you.
[15:37.370 --> 15:38.550]  Okay, I'll mark it for us.
[15:38.670 --> 15:39.130]  Thank you.
[15:39.530 --> 15:40.330]  Steal the van.
[15:42.270 --> 15:43.070]  Oh, it's moving.
[15:43.610 --> 15:44.150]  Oh, okay.
[15:44.250 --> 15:44.930]  Well, just keep...
[15:44.930 --> 15:46.190]  I'll keep an eye on it on the map.
[15:46.450 --> 15:47.570]  Just in that area is fine.
[15:47.910 --> 15:48.830]  Damn, what the hell?
[15:49.190 --> 15:49.830]  We're getting bullied.
[15:51.070 --> 15:52.690]  I thought my wheels pushed.
[15:56.170 --> 15:59.230]  Is that the like Fast and Furious equivalent of getting your shit pushed in?
[16:00.230 --> 16:01.370]  I got my wheels pushed in.
[16:01.370 --> 16:02.770]  Oh, he's pushing my wheels.
[16:02.910 --> 16:04.270]  He's putting my wheels pushed in.
[16:07.770 --> 16:10.170]  Okay, we're on the move.
[16:11.890 --> 16:13.690]  All right, right now it seems to be stopped at all.
[16:13.770 --> 16:14.110]  Yeah, I see.
[16:15.570 --> 16:17.150]  So what do we have to do when we get there?
[16:17.390 --> 16:18.170]  Steal it, I guess.
[16:19.070 --> 16:21.030]  You want me to pull around front or do you want me to just pull up next to it?
[16:21.070 --> 16:21.590]  You hop out.
[16:22.230 --> 16:22.830]  Pull around front.
[16:23.090 --> 16:23.190]  Okay.
[16:23.750 --> 16:24.590]  Oh, what the fuck?
[16:24.870 --> 16:25.230]  Oh, shit.
[16:25.350 --> 16:27.010]  Oh, I think it wanted you to go on the upper deck.
[16:27.170 --> 16:27.330]  It did.
[16:27.470 --> 16:27.710]  Yeah.
[16:27.850 --> 16:28.190]  Oh, well.
[16:28.450 --> 16:28.730]  It's fine.
[16:28.950 --> 16:29.430]  What can you do?
[16:30.070 --> 16:30.910]  Let me check the map again.
[16:31.890 --> 16:33.090]  Oh, they're going to beat us to it.
[16:33.410 --> 16:33.870]  Oh, shite.
[16:34.150 --> 16:34.610]  Oh, maybe not.
[16:34.710 --> 16:35.210]  They hit a wall.
[16:37.450 --> 16:38.530]  It's coming to us anyway.
[16:39.290 --> 16:40.050]  Oh, look at this.
[16:40.710 --> 16:42.230]  Oh, it's a photo finish.
[16:43.570 --> 16:43.830]  All right.
[16:44.870 --> 16:45.450]  Steal the van.
[16:45.630 --> 16:45.830]  All right, get it.
[16:45.930 --> 16:46.770]  I'm just going to get out and take it.
[16:46.790 --> 16:47.150]  No!
[16:47.850 --> 16:49.190]  No, my body!
[16:51.870 --> 16:52.630]  Gonna get it.
[16:53.550 --> 16:54.430]  Why are you laughing?
[16:56.990 --> 16:57.710]  Let's go.
[16:58.930 --> 16:59.970]  I'm trying to get in!
[17:00.330 --> 17:00.930]  Come on.
[17:02.950 --> 17:03.750]  Oh, let's go.
[17:03.790 --> 17:04.830]  All right, we're in.
[17:04.850 --> 17:05.750]  Let's go.
[17:08.890 --> 17:11.750]  Andrew's blood chin stain is on the back.
[17:12.510 --> 17:13.550]  I wish I saw it.
[17:13.570 --> 17:14.230]  I don't see it.
[17:15.890 --> 17:17.070]  It's all over the back.
[17:18.410 --> 17:18.950]  Oh, dear.
[17:18.950 --> 17:19.810]  Oh, my God.
[17:20.370 --> 17:21.450]  That guy took a spill.
[17:22.230 --> 17:25.010]  On my screen, he like magnetized to the vehicle.
[17:28.650 --> 17:29.350]  We're doing...
[17:29.350 --> 17:31.130]  We are doing Fast and Furious stuff with magnets.
[17:31.130 --> 17:31.710]  Oh, my God.
[17:31.770 --> 17:32.310]  This is awesome.
[17:32.750 --> 17:33.490]  Who's driving the van?
[17:33.890 --> 17:34.090]  Me.
[17:34.250 --> 17:34.910]  I'm driving there.
[17:35.050 --> 17:35.870]  I'm driving to Lester's thing.
[17:36.410 --> 17:36.750]  Oh, why?
[17:37.330 --> 17:39.030]  Because I thought we were going to get start getting shot at.
[17:39.110 --> 17:39.610]  I got nervous.
[17:40.110 --> 17:40.530]  Get in the van.
[17:41.570 --> 17:41.890]  Okay.
[17:43.010 --> 17:43.810]  I'm coming to the van.
[17:43.930 --> 17:44.690]  We're catching up to you.
[17:44.910 --> 17:46.150]  Well, yeah, I'm coming.
[17:46.390 --> 17:46.810]  Are you driving, Gavin?
[17:47.550 --> 17:48.210]  What's that, Nick?
[17:48.830 --> 17:49.610]  You're driving, right?
[17:49.770 --> 17:49.970]  Yeah.
[17:50.430 --> 17:50.750]  Okay.
[17:52.110 --> 17:52.790]  Certainly not me.
[17:52.870 --> 17:53.310]  I'm in the back.
[17:53.490 --> 17:53.770]  Oh!
[17:55.610 --> 17:55.770]  All right, here I come.
[17:55.870 --> 17:57.110]  Lester's going to be so mad.
[17:57.770 --> 17:58.550]  Okay, here I come.
[18:00.790 --> 18:02.190]  I don't know if there's room back here.
[18:02.650 --> 18:03.010]  Okay.
[18:06.910 --> 18:08.710]  We don't need to be reporting this.
[18:08.850 --> 18:09.430]  Okay, I'm in.
[18:10.070 --> 18:10.790]  Hell, yeah.
[18:11.550 --> 18:13.070]  I don't quite know where you warped to.
[18:13.290 --> 18:14.110]  Oh, he's in the back.
[18:14.790 --> 18:15.430]  You're in the back?
[18:15.830 --> 18:17.350]  I gotta go first person to see this.
[18:18.510 --> 18:18.950]  Yeah, me too.
[18:19.330 --> 18:20.450]  Party van.
[18:22.390 --> 18:24.250]  This van looks like it's padded back here.
[18:24.250 --> 18:26.430]  Bop, bop, bop, ba-da-da-da.
[18:30.860 --> 18:31.800]  Turn this in.
[18:33.680 --> 18:34.320]  Hell, yeah.
[18:34.440 --> 18:35.340]  Under the bridge.
[18:35.700 --> 18:37.820]  Under the bridge forever.
[18:38.240 --> 18:38.900]  We did it!
[18:40.940 --> 18:41.460]  Yeah.
[18:42.080 --> 18:42.800]  Now we're blaze people.
[18:45.040 --> 18:46.240]  Who the fuck are you?
[18:46.780 --> 18:47.580]  That's Lester.
[18:48.280 --> 18:48.920]  Oh, shit.
[18:52.600 --> 18:56.460]  I've heard you're the master of disguise, Lester, but even I'm in...
[18:57.160 --> 18:57.760]  Yeah.
[19:00.360 --> 19:00.960]  Skip.
[19:02.240 --> 19:04.100]  When you can, take it to Lester's guy.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.120]  Who's Lester's guy?
[19:07.340 --> 19:09.980]  Walks around the corner and then turns into Lester.
[19:12.080 --> 19:13.500]  I'm Lester's guy.
[19:13.920 --> 19:15.180]  Oh, the navigator.
[19:15.220 --> 19:16.620]  I'm Drew with the plat.
[19:17.220 --> 19:17.960]  We took all the pictures.
[19:18.140 --> 19:18.360]  Wow.
[19:19.140 --> 19:19.620]  That's true.
[19:19.780 --> 19:20.020]  You're my grand.
[19:20.320 --> 19:21.120]  Because of my navigator.
[19:21.860 --> 19:23.120]  Platinum in photography.
[19:25.040 --> 19:26.600]  I took two pictures.
[19:26.720 --> 19:27.720]  I played Dead Rising.
[19:29.580 --> 19:32.900]  The new one's out.
[19:33.540 --> 19:34.060]  It's out.
[19:34.380 --> 19:35.760]  Oh, it's been out.
[19:35.940 --> 19:40.440]  I have every achievement, but the seven day survivor is thinking about doing a long story.
[19:40.500 --> 19:40.660]  Do it live.
[19:41.040 --> 19:41.820]  I want to.
[19:42.240 --> 19:46.080]  It's apparently a lot shorter than it was before.
[19:48.480 --> 19:49.260]  Seven days.
[19:49.500 --> 19:49.600]  Yeah.
[19:49.620 --> 19:51.620]  The seven day survivor thing is apparently a lot shorter now.
[19:51.700 --> 19:52.940]  Oh, interesting.
[19:53.100 --> 19:54.980]  Okay, I guess we got to go back to the apartment.
[19:55.520 --> 19:55.820]  Okay.
[19:57.360 --> 19:57.820]  That's cool.
[19:57.940 --> 19:58.260]  Everyone jump in.
[19:58.340 --> 19:58.600]  My car.
[19:58.840 --> 19:59.740]  My car's up the street.
[20:00.240 --> 20:00.900]  Everyone jump in.
[20:00.960 --> 20:01.680]  Where the fuck is my car?
[20:02.080 --> 20:02.740]  Looks around the corner.
[20:04.460 --> 20:05.180]  Why don't we take the bus?
[20:06.880 --> 20:07.440]  That's a good idea.
[20:07.540 --> 20:08.120]  Good for the environment.
[20:08.520 --> 20:09.080]  Where are we going?
[20:09.180 --> 20:10.280]  We're going to his apartment or whatever?
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.520]  Can you put a waypoint down for me, Gavin?
[20:13.680 --> 20:14.580]  What is your apartment under?
[20:15.160 --> 20:17.420]  It's a fancy one that everyone bought when it launched.
[20:17.600 --> 20:18.760]  I assume it's the orange thing on the map.
[20:19.360 --> 20:20.200]  I would think so.
[20:23.900 --> 20:24.800]  Oh, God.
[20:25.140 --> 20:26.100]  Oh, God.
[20:26.380 --> 20:27.500]  Things okay over there?
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.160]  Yeah, I helped them reposition a little.
[20:30.300 --> 20:30.540]  Nice.
[20:33.640 --> 20:34.720]  Well, I'm almost back.
[20:34.940 --> 20:36.560]  So I can pull all of you in.
[20:37.020 --> 20:37.320]  Great.
[20:37.720 --> 20:38.480]  Suck us in.
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.920]  Fuck that.
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.980]  My brain broke when you said that.
[20:46.480 --> 20:48.680]  I hit a car.
[20:48.860 --> 20:51.440]  I hit a car that I don't feel I actually hit.
[20:51.440 --> 20:53.060]  Oh, fuck!
[20:53.900 --> 20:54.800]  Eric, get alongside him.
[20:54.840 --> 20:56.060]  I want to jump out onto his car.
[20:56.260 --> 21:00.000]  Oh, a cyclist.
[21:05.870 --> 21:06.230]  Okay.
[21:07.290 --> 21:08.730]  Nick, yeah, we got to go side to side.
[21:08.810 --> 21:08.890]  Ready?
[21:09.030 --> 21:09.210]  Go.
[21:09.490 --> 21:09.710]  All right.
[21:09.750 --> 21:09.870]  Yeah.
[21:10.010 --> 21:10.190]  Go.
[21:11.010 --> 21:12.430]  Now, Andrew or Gavin.
[21:14.230 --> 21:14.590]  Cyclist!
[21:15.670 --> 21:16.110]  I'm going.
[21:16.410 --> 21:17.710]  Oh, I got hit by the bike.
[21:18.810 --> 21:19.530]  My car!
[21:27.150 --> 21:28.710]  Gavin, you know the rules!
[21:34.030 --> 21:34.930]  I made it.
[21:35.030 --> 21:35.510]  Andrew, hurry up.
[21:35.590 --> 21:36.410]  I'm in.
[21:36.670 --> 21:37.850]  I'm walking in right now.
[21:38.070 --> 21:39.010]  Oh my god.
[21:40.590 --> 21:43.910]  That was the longest blood streak of my own blood I've ever seen.
[21:45.810 --> 21:47.470]  Nobody streaks my own blood.
[21:49.230 --> 21:49.950]  Catch me.
[21:52.410 --> 21:53.810]  Andrew, invite us.
[21:54.010 --> 21:56.430]  I'm walking into my apartment.
[21:57.130 --> 21:57.410]  Oh.
[21:58.850 --> 22:00.350]  Um, get a high-splanning board.
[22:00.510 --> 22:00.830]  Oh shit, oh shit.
[22:02.650 --> 22:03.650]  The signal.
[22:04.590 --> 22:05.750]  That was incredible.
[22:06.350 --> 22:07.330]  That was awesome.
[22:07.770 --> 22:08.330]  Here, hop in.
[22:09.190 --> 22:12.070]  You blew up and drove into my forehead at the same time.
[22:13.550 --> 22:16.170]  Listen, that deserves a free ride back to the apartment.
[22:16.170 --> 22:17.010]  There you go.
[22:17.810 --> 22:18.910]  Oh wait, never mind.
[22:19.610 --> 22:20.030]  Oh!
[22:20.930 --> 22:23.690]  Bring the transponder to Abby Schwarzman.
[22:24.570 --> 22:25.370]  Signal expert.
[22:25.530 --> 22:28.150]  So you can tune it to the right frequency for the Pacific Standard die packs.
[22:28.850 --> 22:32.030]  I just watched Nick's soul get sucked out while I was in the car with him.
[22:32.110 --> 22:32.510]  Cool.
[22:35.010 --> 22:35.410]  Accepted.
[22:38.090 --> 22:38.490]  Accepted.
[22:39.770 --> 22:40.690]  Did you put it on hard?
[22:41.390 --> 22:41.850]  I sure did.
[22:42.470 --> 22:43.270]  Just making sure.
[22:43.590 --> 22:43.770]  Going.
[22:45.450 --> 22:45.890]  I'm in.
[22:46.750 --> 22:48.530]  Oh, my starting weapon is a machete.
[22:50.030 --> 22:51.510]  Tune it to the right frequency.
[22:52.090 --> 22:53.350]  Oh, we're doing boat stuff?
[22:53.690 --> 22:54.790]  Oh, I like the raid.
[22:56.470 --> 22:58.230]  I'm gonna put the raid on for TPG.
[22:58.450 --> 23:00.110]  I, dude, I was thinking the raid also.
[23:01.730 --> 23:02.810]  Dude, the raid's sick.
[23:03.210 --> 23:04.310]  Raid, Raid 2 is sick.
[23:04.810 --> 23:06.470]  Raid 1 and 2, what do you mean?
[23:07.270 --> 23:08.170]  You don't like Raid 1?
[23:09.310 --> 23:10.590]  Yeah, but Raid 2 is sick.
[23:10.770 --> 23:12.750]  They're both, they're both real good.
[23:14.050 --> 23:17.770]  I don't think you should diminish the raid because of how sick the Raid 2 is.
[23:19.130 --> 23:20.250]  You know what? Fair.
[23:21.370 --> 23:26.790]  The guy gets a light bulb in the throat and blood starts spurting out of it while he's fighting other dudes.
[23:26.790 --> 23:28.050]  Where is me vehicle?
[23:28.290 --> 23:29.630]  I think this is what I picked.
[23:30.310 --> 23:31.370]  I think this is what I picked.
[23:31.710 --> 23:32.710]  Nope, that's not mine.
[23:33.070 --> 23:33.710]  Let's do it.
[23:34.650 --> 23:35.630]  Andrew's got my Fagia.
[23:37.570 --> 23:38.990]  Andrew's gonna drive himself, I guess.
[23:39.230 --> 23:39.310]  All right.
[23:39.310 --> 23:39.970]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[23:39.990 --> 23:40.190]  Okay, I'll see you there.
[23:40.870 --> 23:41.910]  No, there's no, no, no.
[23:41.910 --> 23:43.010]  What are you no, no, no-ing?
[23:43.010 --> 23:45.390]  One sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec, one sec.
[23:45.550 --> 23:45.930]  What do you want?
[23:45.970 --> 23:46.270]  What do you want?
[23:46.290 --> 23:46.590]  What do you want?
[23:46.730 --> 23:46.910]  I wanna get in.
[23:47.230 --> 23:48.190]  Okay, okay.
[23:48.490 --> 23:48.530]  Sure.
[23:48.530 --> 23:50.470]  There we go.
[23:50.870 --> 23:51.630]  You're a mess.
[23:51.910 --> 23:52.410]  Oh, boy.
[23:53.130 --> 23:54.670]  This is a little tanky.
[23:56.730 --> 23:57.490]  I'm in first person.
[23:57.590 --> 23:58.050]  We look cool.
[23:58.730 --> 23:58.950]  Perfect.
[23:59.170 --> 23:59.310]  Yeah.
[24:00.230 --> 24:00.490]  Oops.
[24:01.210 --> 24:01.710]  Oh, shoot me.
[24:01.950 --> 24:02.070]  Streetlight.
[24:02.270 --> 24:02.830]  Okay, I don't like-
[24:03.890 --> 24:06.610]  Hitting other cars in first person feels so much worse.
[24:08.270 --> 24:09.790]  What is going on with the-
[24:09.790 --> 24:10.110]  Okay.
[24:10.270 --> 24:10.550]  Whoa!
[24:10.670 --> 24:12.070]  What is that car doing?
[24:12.470 --> 24:12.790]  What's up?
[24:13.070 --> 24:14.210]  What is he doing?
[24:15.290 --> 24:16.290]  Hey, what you got there?
[24:16.910 --> 24:17.550]  Can you see this?
[24:18.970 --> 24:19.610]  Jesus Christ!
[24:19.610 --> 24:21.030]  Dear God, you're making the car swing out!
[24:21.030 --> 24:21.570]  What's the matter?
[24:21.610 --> 24:23.370]  Why don't we all hold a grenade out the window?
[24:26.290 --> 24:27.950]  I thought we wanted to beat this.
[24:28.650 --> 24:29.690]  We just have to hold it.
[24:29.730 --> 24:30.510]  We don't have to use it.
[24:31.710 --> 24:32.910]  Isn't that a problem?
[24:33.090 --> 24:33.890]  Do you want to go off?
[24:34.470 --> 24:34.790]  Nope.
[24:35.570 --> 24:36.690]  Is this one going off?
[24:38.870 --> 24:39.970]  I guess-
[24:41.190 --> 24:42.850]  I don't see any other grenades hanging out the window.
[24:43.210 --> 24:44.390]  What's the button to cycle the weapons?
[24:44.550 --> 24:44.850]  Is it X?
[24:44.910 --> 24:45.210]  X.
[24:45.290 --> 24:45.510]  X.
[24:45.570 --> 24:45.730]  X.
[24:45.830 --> 24:46.030]  There we go.
[24:46.030 --> 24:46.710]  And then we just hold left trigger.
[24:46.810 --> 24:47.190]  There we go.
[24:47.230 --> 24:47.470]  Got it.
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.570]  That's three.
[24:49.290 --> 24:50.990]  This is awesome!
[24:51.430 --> 24:51.850]  Who's driving?
[24:52.190 --> 24:53.650]  Am I holding out the window for you?
[24:53.750 --> 24:54.230]  You are.
[24:54.510 --> 24:54.570]  Yeah.
[24:54.750 --> 24:56.590]  And first person, I'm just holding it in the car.
[24:57.670 --> 24:58.310]  Oh, really?
[24:58.450 --> 24:58.730]  I want to see.
[24:58.990 --> 25:00.710]  How do you hold it without chucking it?
[25:00.970 --> 25:01.090]  Oh, wow.
[25:01.090 --> 25:02.510]  It does look like I'm holding it in the car.
[25:02.790 --> 25:03.650]  No, you're holding it out the window.
[25:03.790 --> 25:04.130]  That's cool.
[25:04.390 --> 25:07.270]  Well, left trigger for me is different.
[25:07.670 --> 25:07.930]  Well, yeah.
[25:10.690 --> 25:12.410]  So if I just hold it like this-
[25:12.410 --> 25:13.010]  Oh, someone threw it.
[25:13.630 --> 25:14.230]  Oh, that was me!
[25:14.970 --> 25:15.510]  Oh, no, it wasn't.
[25:16.970 --> 25:19.870]  Nick just saying shit.
[25:20.190 --> 25:21.230]  Wanted level!
[25:22.910 --> 25:23.730]  That was me!
[25:24.170 --> 25:24.670]  No, it wasn't.
[25:24.670 --> 25:25.730]  This looks so good.
[25:29.250 --> 25:29.810]  Get away.
[25:30.350 --> 25:31.230]  Get away from us.
[25:32.370 --> 25:34.150]  This is what we do to intimidate red lights.
[25:34.530 --> 25:35.910]  We'll do it.
[25:36.530 --> 25:37.730]  You got to get down there, buddy.
[25:38.230 --> 25:38.730]  I know, I know.
[25:38.790 --> 25:39.610]  There's a left turn up here.
[25:42.010 --> 25:43.610]  Coming up, coming up, coming up, coming up.
[25:43.610 --> 25:45.150]  Is it the safer version as well?
[25:49.220 --> 25:51.060]  Oh, what a drift!
[25:51.540 --> 25:52.400]  That was incredible!
[25:53.140 --> 25:54.160]  That was so good!
[25:54.520 --> 25:54.720]  Wow!
[25:55.660 --> 25:57.060]  That was awesome!
[25:57.920 --> 25:58.700]  How do I get down there?
[25:58.700 --> 25:59.300]  You just hang a right.
[25:59.360 --> 25:59.780]  There you go.
[26:01.120 --> 26:01.340]  Easy.
[26:02.140 --> 26:05.120]  Oh, it's a Chomsky's mission.
[26:05.460 --> 26:06.100]  Witnesses!
[26:07.020 --> 26:08.200]  No, Nick.
[26:11.100 --> 26:12.660]  Well, wanted level.
[26:13.180 --> 26:13.800]  Come on!
[26:15.340 --> 26:16.200]  You fuck!
[26:16.580 --> 26:17.660]  You piece of shit!
[26:18.440 --> 26:18.840]  What?
[26:21.060 --> 26:21.080]  What?
[26:21.880 --> 26:22.880]  All right, we're out of here.
[26:24.300 --> 26:24.820]  Uh-oh.
[26:25.080 --> 26:26.560]  Got to escape this wanted level, guys.
[26:26.600 --> 26:26.960]  Come on.
[26:27.840 --> 26:28.820]  Yeah, who did that?
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.600]  Go to the island.
[26:30.580 --> 26:31.920]  Guys, we got to go to the island.
[26:32.040 --> 26:32.280]  Let's go.
[26:32.560 --> 26:32.900]  Fuck me.
[26:33.600 --> 26:34.840]  We have to go back.
[26:36.080 --> 26:37.140]  Who has to go back?
[26:37.300 --> 26:37.800]  Oh, I see.
[26:37.840 --> 26:38.720]  It's like a lost thing.
[26:38.760 --> 26:39.100]  That's fun.
[26:39.340 --> 26:39.620]  Yeah.
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.740]  I'm over here by the banyan trees.
[26:46.960 --> 26:52.640]  When we were playing Graw the other day, Bernie was online in Dead Rising, the original.
[26:53.180 --> 26:56.960]  And he just sent me a text of both of us in the 360.
[26:57.180 --> 26:59.660]  He said, are you watching Lost this week?
[27:07.460 --> 27:08.380]  Oh, man.
[27:08.880 --> 27:11.080]  Why was he playing the original Dead Rising?
[27:11.900 --> 27:12.780]  I don't know.
[27:14.120 --> 27:14.640]  Jesus.
[27:15.460 --> 27:17.140]  We're gonna slap in the sea.
[27:17.320 --> 27:19.740]  Maybe he was comparing back and forth or something.
[27:19.880 --> 27:20.200]  I don't know.
[27:22.140 --> 27:24.740]  Is this the longest we've gone in heists without killing anyone?
[27:25.720 --> 27:26.360]  Oh, baby.
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.300]  Oh, it has to be.
[27:27.580 --> 27:29.560]  We've done photography and jet ski so far.
[27:30.940 --> 27:32.840]  I mean, I shot a bystander on the beach.
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.700]  Oh, I'm not saying there wasn't some collateral in terms of, like, missioning.
[27:37.060 --> 27:37.300]  Right.
[27:37.440 --> 27:38.660]  Oh, then yeah.
[27:40.280 --> 27:40.720]  Jeez.
[27:41.340 --> 27:44.320]  Where the god damn is the island?
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.160]  Remember when we were doing this in real life?
[27:46.980 --> 27:47.120]  No.
[27:47.320 --> 27:47.620]  Yeah.
[27:48.000 --> 27:48.440]  No.
[27:49.140 --> 27:50.180]  Guys, we have to go around.
[27:50.600 --> 27:51.060]  Go around.
[27:51.160 --> 27:51.660]  Go around.
[27:51.880 --> 27:52.420]  This is land.
[27:53.580 --> 27:54.660]  I hate this.
[27:55.180 --> 27:56.200]  This is awful.
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.580]  I really don't enjoy slapping the sea.
[28:01.580 --> 28:04.880]  No, it's just so this guy can do his voice lines.
[28:05.220 --> 28:06.160]  Like, oh, come on.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.220]  Is there this much slapping in real life?
[28:12.100 --> 28:13.860]  Are you guys beached?
[28:13.860 --> 28:16.120]  No, you're right by the fucking land.
[28:16.340 --> 28:16.780]  No!
[28:19.100 --> 28:20.340]  Gavin hit me.
[28:21.520 --> 28:23.560]  It won't let me on my on my jet ski.
[28:23.780 --> 28:24.420]  Oh, no.
[28:24.860 --> 28:25.640]  Okay, there we go.
[28:30.160 --> 28:31.960]  Was I yellow or were you?
[28:33.720 --> 28:34.700]  I don't remember.
[28:35.460 --> 28:36.280]  I don't remember.
[28:38.920 --> 28:39.880]  Oh, a speedophile.
[28:40.100 --> 28:40.480]  That's funny.
[28:42.780 --> 28:43.660]  What's the joke?
[28:43.860 --> 28:45.320]  Oh, what the hell?
[28:47.380 --> 28:50.480]  I was like right on top of Nick when that happened, too.
[28:50.640 --> 28:51.580]  Oh, my God.
[28:51.640 --> 28:53.500]  I may have put a sticky bomb on that one earlier.
[28:55.300 --> 28:56.460]  And you didn't blow up.
[28:56.560 --> 28:57.020]  That's insane.
[28:57.560 --> 28:57.940]  Crazy.
[28:59.140 --> 29:00.100]  Oh, my God.
[29:00.240 --> 29:01.180]  Oh, yeah, that's insane.
[29:01.420 --> 29:03.720]  Imagine starting this part over again.
[29:04.940 --> 29:05.600]  Please, no.
[29:06.400 --> 29:08.440]  When Gavin blows up all the jet skis.
[29:08.460 --> 29:08.800]  Please, no.
[29:11.800 --> 29:12.740]  We're so close.
[29:12.820 --> 29:13.760]  God, this sucks.
[29:14.120 --> 29:15.720]  Editor, edit all this out.
[29:16.440 --> 29:17.540]  Edit, cut it back in.
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.760]  No, editor, take it out.
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.500]  Cut back for this argument.
[29:23.900 --> 29:24.960]  Oh, I see a helicopter.
[29:25.480 --> 29:25.740]  I see it.
[29:25.740 --> 29:28.420]  Without looking it up, do sharks have tongues?
[29:29.280 --> 29:29.640]  No.
[29:29.860 --> 29:30.020]  Yeah.
[29:31.000 --> 29:31.380]  Whales have tongues.
[29:31.380 --> 29:32.180]  Oh, no, they don't.
[29:32.240 --> 29:32.740]  Whales have tongues.
[29:32.780 --> 29:34.920]  Okay, so Nick said yes and then immediately said no.
[29:35.000 --> 29:35.160]  Got it.
[29:35.160 --> 29:36.360]  Oh, we're killing people now.
[29:36.360 --> 29:37.640]  Yeah, well, I had to think about it.
[29:37.680 --> 29:40.700]  I was like, what was the movie where they were feeding the...
[29:41.820 --> 29:42.340]  Free Willy?
[29:43.760 --> 29:44.120]  Yeah.
[29:45.760 --> 29:46.900]  How do we get up here?
[29:47.500 --> 29:47.900]  Jesus!
[29:48.480 --> 29:49.200]  Just jump.
[29:49.500 --> 29:49.960]  Jump and go.
[29:50.000 --> 29:50.680]  Oh, shit.
[29:50.840 --> 29:51.620]  It's the police.
[29:52.900 --> 29:53.300]  Interesting.
[29:56.240 --> 29:57.660]  I'm stuck on the hill.
[29:58.000 --> 29:58.620]  Way to go, buddy.
[29:59.520 --> 30:00.360]  All right, got this.
[30:00.980 --> 30:04.240]  I ran in with the intent of, yeah, let's fucking kill some people and then remember it.
[30:04.260 --> 30:04.960]  Oh, this is hard.
[30:05.440 --> 30:07.200]  I should probably be somewhat careful.
[30:08.420 --> 30:09.360]  Oh, I like that.
[30:09.480 --> 30:09.820]  Good shooting.
[30:10.500 --> 30:10.720]  Yeah.
[30:10.940 --> 30:11.340]  There you go.
[30:11.660 --> 30:12.260]  Gotta do something.
[30:12.440 --> 30:13.060]  That's for you.
[30:13.060 --> 30:13.920]  Nice.
[30:14.780 --> 30:15.740]  All right.
[30:15.880 --> 30:16.880]  I can't fucking see.
[30:17.060 --> 30:17.480]  Oh, shit.
[30:17.500 --> 30:17.920]  I'm going to die.
[30:18.040 --> 30:18.360]  Fuck.
[30:19.020 --> 30:20.240]  Please go up there.
[30:20.580 --> 30:20.620]  Well.
[30:21.440 --> 30:22.660]  See you back at the boats, boys.
[30:22.860 --> 30:23.120]  Okay.
[30:23.560 --> 30:26.800]  I swear, if it does not checkpoint us at this island.
[30:28.560 --> 30:30.240]  If we have to go all the way.
[30:31.860 --> 30:32.960]  There's no way.
[30:36.220 --> 30:37.180]  Oh, God.
[30:39.360 --> 30:40.340]  Restart from checkpoint.
[30:41.240 --> 30:41.640]  Oh, God.
[30:41.640 --> 30:43.020]  It's going to go straight back down.
[30:43.220 --> 30:44.740]  This is going to go straight back down.
[30:45.000 --> 30:45.840]  Straight to the ground.
[30:46.040 --> 30:46.520]  Straight down.
[30:46.800 --> 30:47.000]  Straight.
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.160]  Zoom. Zoom in.
[30:48.380 --> 30:48.740]  Okay.
[30:49.400 --> 30:49.940]  Is it?
[30:50.340 --> 30:50.600]  Yeah.
[30:51.280 --> 30:53.200]  It just moved us across the way.
[30:53.320 --> 30:53.480]  No!
[30:54.500 --> 30:58.300]  Why wouldn't this be the place that we start from?
[30:58.540 --> 30:59.440]  It doesn't make sense.
[31:02.480 --> 31:03.540]  It's okay. It's not far.
[31:04.340 --> 31:05.180]  No, I get it.
[31:05.220 --> 31:09.280]  I'm saying that, like, why wouldn't this be the spot instead of having to go on the water
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.640]  for that long?
[31:12.920 --> 31:14.500]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[31:15.380 --> 31:15.880]  Is it?
[31:16.340 --> 31:16.520]  Is it?
[31:16.900 --> 31:17.920]  Get my weapon equipped.
[31:18.840 --> 31:19.340]  There we go.
[31:19.680 --> 31:20.940]  Anyone want to ride to the other ones?
[31:21.800 --> 31:21.940]  Yeah.
[31:25.960 --> 31:26.980]  Why don't we just...
[31:26.980 --> 31:28.400]  At least it's a shorter path.
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.020]  Oh, I thought that's what you meant.
[31:31.920 --> 31:32.280]  Oh.
[31:32.900 --> 31:34.780]  You were going to take me to a different jet ski?
[31:35.020 --> 31:35.800]  Yeah, I was just going to...
[31:35.800 --> 31:36.840]  Why would he take...
[31:36.840 --> 31:37.440]  Why would you...
[31:37.440 --> 31:38.580]  Oh, my God.
[31:39.580 --> 31:41.200]  Hey, why would you engage without us?
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.200]  There's a question.
[31:42.500 --> 31:42.980]  Engage what?
[31:43.140 --> 31:43.920]  I'm not engaged yet.
[31:44.060 --> 31:44.320]  He's married.
[31:44.560 --> 31:45.260]  I'm on the island.
[31:45.260 --> 31:45.460]  He's already married.
[31:45.500 --> 31:45.680]  Wah!
[31:48.340 --> 31:49.260]  Oh, got me there.
[31:50.000 --> 31:50.440]  Thanks, Nick.
[31:51.320 --> 31:51.740]  You're welcome.
[31:52.520 --> 31:53.900]  Let's kill all these beasts and take care of this.
[31:54.200 --> 31:54.640]  Can we take out the helicopter again?
[31:55.400 --> 31:55.900]  Got it.
[31:56.120 --> 31:56.700]  Thank you.
[31:58.940 --> 32:00.560]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[32:02.520 --> 32:04.180]  There's just, like...
[32:04.180 --> 32:06.680]  There's just, like, a backing vocal in an Eminem track.
[32:07.820 --> 32:08.960]  There's, like, no cover.
[32:10.580 --> 32:11.560]  That was a tree, guys.
[32:11.560 --> 32:12.620]  I shredded it.
[32:15.160 --> 32:16.800]  I hate the shape of this.
[32:16.940 --> 32:17.860]  Everything about this.
[32:17.900 --> 32:18.740]  Oh, I'll take care of the chopper.
[32:18.940 --> 32:19.240]  Yeah, you got it.
[32:19.420 --> 32:19.620]  Thank you.
[32:19.720 --> 32:20.060]  Bad angles.
[32:20.180 --> 32:20.420]  Yeah.
[32:21.480 --> 32:22.160]  That's for you.
[32:22.900 --> 32:23.220]  Nice.
[32:23.860 --> 32:24.500]  Nice shot.
[32:25.260 --> 32:27.460]  Well, I have homing, to be fair, but...
[32:28.680 --> 32:29.100]  But thank you.
[32:29.380 --> 32:30.340]  Take the compliment.
[32:31.420 --> 32:32.260]  You're right, it was all me.
[32:32.300 --> 32:33.200]  No, he's an honest man.
[32:34.120 --> 32:34.220]  Oh.
[32:38.740 --> 32:40.280]  There's some rocks here, Eric, if you want to cover.
[32:40.360 --> 32:41.380]  I got, I got one.
[32:41.560 --> 32:42.300]  There we go.
[32:42.520 --> 32:45.020]  I better run out of ammo before I get there.
[32:45.900 --> 32:46.640]  Switch guns.
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.340]  I'm committed now.
[32:49.520 --> 32:49.860]  Okay.
[32:51.220 --> 32:52.320]  Yeah, what was I thinking?
[32:57.400 --> 32:57.820]  Headshot.
[32:58.280 --> 32:58.980]  Pushing up.
[33:02.280 --> 33:03.800]  The heist music's so good.
[33:04.420 --> 33:05.200]  You have heist music on?
[33:05.320 --> 33:06.360]  I don't have any music.
[33:06.560 --> 33:07.040]  You have music?
[33:07.400 --> 33:08.360]  Yeah, I don't have any music.
[33:08.460 --> 33:09.020]  I have music turned off.
[33:09.700 --> 33:10.700]  Music's great in this.
[33:11.480 --> 33:12.600]  I don't have any music on.
[33:13.440 --> 33:13.980]  Why not?
[33:14.240 --> 33:14.820]  I don't know.
[33:14.840 --> 33:16.540]  Seems like a dangerous game to have music for.
[33:17.680 --> 33:18.760]  I don't have the radio on.
[33:20.060 --> 33:22.240]  You can turn off the radio without turning off all the music?
[33:22.680 --> 33:22.920]  Big time.
[33:24.900 --> 33:25.260]  Oh.
[33:26.280 --> 33:27.200]  And you can shoot people.
[33:29.060 --> 33:30.400]  You can do anything in this game.
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.400]  Oh, we're still on a police boat.
[33:33.680 --> 33:35.020]  Oh, that's the one I crashed into earlier.
[33:36.400 --> 33:37.840]  When I was like, oh, the police are here.
[33:40.720 --> 33:42.420]  Oh, I love that stride.
[33:43.220 --> 33:44.040]  I see you.
[33:44.040 --> 33:44.240]  Are we?
[33:44.540 --> 33:45.200]  Andrew, wait.
[33:45.700 --> 33:45.980]  Okay.
[33:46.440 --> 33:47.200]  All right, bye, dude.
[33:47.220 --> 33:48.340]  Oh, sorry.
[33:48.700 --> 33:49.080]  Here we go.
[33:50.020 --> 33:50.980]  Oh, God, I'm going to get hit.
[33:51.020 --> 33:52.420]  Backing up, backing up, backing up, backing up.
[33:52.820 --> 33:53.800]  I'm on the jet ski.
[33:56.280 --> 33:57.040]  I'm in the boat.
[33:57.460 --> 33:58.460]  Every time with you.
[33:58.560 --> 33:59.320]  Gavin, for God's sake.
[33:59.320 --> 34:00.140]  Every time with you.
[34:02.080 --> 34:03.320]  All right, I'll be the mounted turret.
[34:03.360 --> 34:03.560]  Oh!
[34:03.900 --> 34:04.980]  Oh, my God, Nick!
[34:04.980 --> 34:05.000]  Oh, my God, Nick!
[34:05.420 --> 34:06.140]  What happened?
[34:06.280 --> 34:06.520]  Woo!
[34:07.080 --> 34:07.780]  I entered it.
[34:07.800 --> 34:08.760]  I entered it with a gun.
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.020]  That was pretty cool.
[34:10.660 --> 34:11.180]  Chill out.
[34:11.180 --> 34:12.960]  I'm getting shot.
[34:13.060 --> 34:13.660]  Help me.
[34:14.020 --> 34:15.140]  You'll figure it out.
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.980]  No, he'll die.
[34:17.160 --> 34:18.020]  It will start over.
[34:19.480 --> 34:20.240]  He'll be fine.
[34:20.860 --> 34:22.220]  Come back for me.
[34:22.260 --> 34:22.800]  No bad idea.
[34:23.100 --> 34:24.220]  If he dies, we have to redo it.
[34:26.120 --> 34:26.820]  That's me.
[34:26.920 --> 34:27.760]  That's me.
[34:27.980 --> 34:29.800]  I have to get to where you're going.
[34:30.200 --> 34:31.160]  And I don't have a thing.
[34:31.820 --> 34:33.200]  I just wanted to be a bit smokier.
[34:34.300 --> 34:35.080]  Whoops, I shot him.
[34:36.560 --> 34:37.000]  Guys.
[34:37.340 --> 34:37.580]  Yeah.
[34:38.440 --> 34:39.080]  Please fix it up.
[34:39.300 --> 34:39.960]  Get a jet ski.
[34:40.060 --> 34:40.580]  Yeah, you'll be fine.
[34:40.580 --> 34:41.420]  From where?
[34:41.880 --> 34:43.680]  There's vehicles all over the island.
[34:43.880 --> 34:44.700]  We barely left.
[34:44.740 --> 34:46.040]  There were like three jet skis.
[34:46.060 --> 34:47.180]  Andrew doesn't go back for anyone.
[34:47.680 --> 34:47.940]  Yeah.
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.580]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[34:49.940 --> 34:52.660]  You forgot about Andrew going back or you forgot about jet skis?
[34:53.100 --> 34:54.320]  I forgot about Andrew going back.
[34:54.420 --> 34:54.520]  Yeah.
[34:54.580 --> 34:55.380]  The jet ski...
[34:55.380 --> 34:58.160]  I fell out so far from land and there's cops everywhere.
[34:59.260 --> 35:00.300]  I'm looking at the map right now.
[35:00.320 --> 35:00.980]  You're not that far.
[35:01.060 --> 35:01.800]  You're on land.
[35:02.560 --> 35:04.560]  I'm on A land, not B land.
[35:05.020 --> 35:06.240]  Oh, oh, hey, hey, Andrew.
[35:06.300 --> 35:10.560]  I think we should probably take an inlet here to the right and get on the ground
[35:10.560 --> 35:11.780]  and get a car and get out of here.
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.580]  Oh, you know, we could actually go if we...
[35:14.580 --> 35:14.700]  Here.
[35:15.180 --> 35:15.960]  I'm going to go the other way.
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.880]  We can go to the sea the entire way.
[35:18.140 --> 35:19.200]  We don't even need to get on land.
[35:19.640 --> 35:20.860]  Eric, park it on this boat.
[35:22.200 --> 35:22.760]  Park what?
[35:23.140 --> 35:23.760]  My jet ski?
[35:23.900 --> 35:24.140]  Follow me.
[35:24.300 --> 35:24.480]  Yeah.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.100]  Okay.
[35:27.260 --> 35:28.060]  I'm faster than...
[35:28.060 --> 35:28.640]  Oh, no, I'm not.
[35:28.700 --> 35:29.440]  No, I'm not even close.
[35:29.680 --> 35:29.920]  You're not.
[35:30.000 --> 35:30.680]  There's a jet ski.
[35:30.840 --> 35:31.200]  Kind of close.
[35:31.680 --> 35:32.700]  But it's not even close.
[35:32.760 --> 35:33.000]  Come on.
[35:34.660 --> 35:36.800]  If I hit one of these waves just right, I think I can do it.
[35:39.760 --> 35:41.040]  Go on, you can do it.
[35:42.760 --> 35:44.080]  You got to get behind the...
[35:44.080 --> 35:44.420]  Hit the button.
[35:45.140 --> 35:47.460]  You will not believe if you...
[35:47.460 --> 35:47.640]  Do it.
[35:47.660 --> 35:49.120]  If you can cut to what just happened to me.
[35:49.120 --> 35:51.220]  Definitely don't look right behind you or I'll be standing.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.320]  I saw you in a boat, Nick, and then nodded about.
[35:55.380 --> 35:56.460]  Yeah, well, uh...
[35:56.460 --> 35:56.980]  Did you capsize?
[35:57.000 --> 35:57.440]  The waves...
[35:58.280 --> 35:59.380]  Nope, I hit a rock.
[36:00.180 --> 36:00.620]  He's done it.
[36:00.680 --> 36:00.960]  Oh!
[36:01.420 --> 36:02.160]  This looks great.
[36:03.160 --> 36:03.920]  Hell, yeah!
[36:05.320 --> 36:06.300]  Oh, it's so good.
[36:06.300 --> 36:07.080]  Oh, damn it!
[36:08.760 --> 36:10.020]  He's going to blow us up.
[36:11.440 --> 36:12.080]  No, I'm not.
[36:12.340 --> 36:12.760]  Hey, it's Nick!
[36:12.800 --> 36:13.160]  Woohoo!
[36:14.160 --> 36:14.520]  Yeah!
[36:16.080 --> 36:17.080]  Yeah, let's go this way.
[36:17.760 --> 36:18.240]  All right.
[36:18.840 --> 36:19.960]  That was a full squad swap.
[36:23.760 --> 36:26.040]  I wonder what Abby's thinking of this.
[36:27.380 --> 36:28.120]  Of all the stunts?
[36:28.160 --> 36:28.960]  Yeah, of all the stunts.
[36:28.980 --> 36:29.840]  Oh, Gavin, you got it.
[36:29.860 --> 36:30.560]  I got a good shot right here.
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.580]  Oh, you swashed it real good.
[36:32.280 --> 36:32.540]  You got it.
[36:32.540 --> 36:32.620]  Woo!
[36:33.120 --> 36:33.480]  Yeah!
[36:33.520 --> 36:34.640]  Oh, you got the rocks.
[36:35.200 --> 36:35.740]  Oh, shit.
[36:35.960 --> 36:36.480]  Come on, boys.
[36:36.560 --> 36:36.920]  Come on.
[36:37.000 --> 36:37.500]  We're banking.
[36:37.500 --> 36:37.980]  Oh, shit.
[36:41.100 --> 36:43.260]  Oh, damn it, you knocked me off.
[36:43.420 --> 36:43.780]  Sorry.
[36:46.920 --> 36:47.740]  Gavin, come on.
[36:47.780 --> 36:48.380]  You got to catch up.
[36:48.980 --> 36:49.600]  Here I come.
[36:49.800 --> 36:50.380]  Okay, here you come.
[36:51.860 --> 36:52.220]  Whoops.
[36:52.400 --> 36:53.280]  Right into the rocks.
[36:55.100 --> 36:55.980]  It's squirrely.
[36:58.000 --> 36:58.680]  Getting there.
[36:59.180 --> 37:00.140]  Man, I'm getting soaked.
[37:00.860 --> 37:02.640]  It's like when I was behind Emily in Key West.
[37:06.300 --> 37:07.180]  Come on.
[37:08.900 --> 37:09.800]  Take my hand.
[37:10.660 --> 37:12.240]  Going up the rapids.
[37:18.440 --> 37:22.400]  Oh, shit, they set up an aquatic police barricade up ahead, it looks like.
[37:22.420 --> 37:22.700]  What?
[37:22.780 --> 37:24.240]  Hold on, let me take the lead.
[37:24.340 --> 37:25.320]  Nick ran me over.
[37:28.700 --> 37:30.940]  An aquatic police barricade?
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.980]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[37:31.980 --> 37:33.060]  Look at it on the map.
[37:33.780 --> 37:35.260]  They got to be just above us, right?
[37:35.800 --> 37:36.460]  Oh, there they are.
[37:36.460 --> 37:37.540]  Oh, they're going to be so mad.
[37:37.540 --> 37:38.300]  Oh, they are on a bridge.
[37:38.500 --> 37:39.360]  Oh, they're about to be pissed.
[37:45.720 --> 37:46.520]  Oh, Nick.
[37:49.920 --> 37:51.760]  Aquatic police barricade.
[37:52.120 --> 37:56.900]  Check this shit out.
[37:57.580 --> 37:59.180]  Oh, this is real cool.
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.680]  Oh, this is some Disneyland shit.
[38:02.880 --> 38:03.840]  What the fuck?
[38:04.420 --> 38:05.420]  You scooped me.
[38:05.580 --> 38:06.420]  You scooped me.
[38:07.000 --> 38:07.660]  Come on, Nick.
[38:08.440 --> 38:09.220]  Come on, Nick.
[38:10.880 --> 38:11.480]  Yeah.
[38:12.380 --> 38:12.980]  Ready?
[38:13.220 --> 38:13.760]  I'm going to jump.
[38:16.660 --> 38:17.820]  Police boat.
[38:20.720 --> 38:21.640]  Police boat?
[38:22.300 --> 38:22.440]  Whoa.
[38:22.480 --> 38:23.800]  Got him.
[38:26.740 --> 38:27.900]  Another one.
[38:29.020 --> 38:30.980]  Oh, God, the cops are right on me.
[38:31.140 --> 38:32.080]  I'll take care of this.
[38:32.340 --> 38:33.380]  An aquatic barricade.
[38:33.380 --> 38:35.100]  I got him, I got him.
[38:35.440 --> 38:36.600]  Aquatic barricade.
[38:37.980 --> 38:38.920]  Gavin, no.
[38:39.840 --> 38:41.000]  Oh, my God.
[38:43.980 --> 38:44.380]  Okay.
[38:44.660 --> 38:45.120]  All right.
[38:45.280 --> 38:45.520]  All right.
[38:45.960 --> 38:46.760]  Oh, shit.
[38:51.780 --> 38:54.500]  Do you guys shoot the cops on these boats?
[38:54.920 --> 38:55.120]  Yep.
[38:55.740 --> 38:56.140]  Okay.
[39:00.410 --> 39:01.170]  We close.
[39:01.250 --> 39:02.130]  Can somebody look at the map?
[39:02.210 --> 39:02.910]  I think we're close.
[39:03.190 --> 39:03.690]  Yeah, give me a second.
[39:04.230 --> 39:05.350]  Gavin's trying to kill us.
[39:05.390 --> 39:05.650]  Hang on.
[39:07.050 --> 39:08.030]  That was pretty cool.
[39:09.070 --> 39:11.610]  Yeah. Hey, Andrew, the problem is it is on land.
[39:12.990 --> 39:13.570]  We can cut.
[39:13.570 --> 39:14.590]  It's close, though, right?
[39:14.850 --> 39:15.510]  I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:15.590 --> 39:20.070]  If you get on the dock here on the left, then we can probably find a car and get through.
[39:20.210 --> 39:22.390]  But like, that's what we got to go.
[39:22.530 --> 39:22.770]  Like.
[39:31.410 --> 39:34.370]  Oh, well, we're definitely on land now.
[39:35.310 --> 39:36.170]  Oh, all right.
[39:36.170 --> 39:37.310]  We got to find a car.
[39:38.070 --> 39:39.430]  Do that little a-hole get out of the boat?
[39:41.230 --> 39:41.830]  Yeah, he's here.
[39:43.690 --> 39:44.290]  Come on.
[39:44.670 --> 39:46.930]  Hey, isn't this where we drop shit for Trevor's heist?
[39:46.930 --> 39:48.850]  Andrew, Andrew, there's a truck here.
[39:49.050 --> 39:49.490]  Awesome.
[39:49.730 --> 39:52.990]  Grab it. Where's where's Avi?
[39:57.180 --> 40:00.640]  We got to make sure he gets in the car and then hang on.
[40:00.800 --> 40:01.820]  I'll get him.
[40:02.820 --> 40:03.980]  Who's this man in the back?
[40:04.060 --> 40:04.640]  He's coming. He's coming.
[40:04.820 --> 40:04.880]  It's me.
[40:06.540 --> 40:07.460]  You moved me.
[40:07.960 --> 40:10.060]  After after he gets in the car.
[40:10.420 --> 40:11.880]  Look how intimate this is.
[40:12.100 --> 40:13.060]  This is really intimate.
[40:13.360 --> 40:15.140]  Our knees are like through each other.
[40:15.520 --> 40:16.920]  Can I get in?
[40:17.080 --> 40:17.540]  Yes, I can.
[40:17.600 --> 40:18.120]  Okay, let's go.
[40:18.700 --> 40:18.960]  Let's do it.
[40:19.060 --> 40:19.660]  What do you want to talk about?
[40:20.780 --> 40:22.920]  Hey, if you can watch your health.
[40:25.860 --> 40:26.920]  The gate's closed.
[40:27.300 --> 40:28.220]  I know I'll keep it safe.
[40:29.500 --> 40:31.600]  Is it an explosive grenade?
[40:32.020 --> 40:34.900]  Oh, God, they pull it out.
[40:35.800 --> 40:36.520]  All right, hold on.
[40:36.600 --> 40:37.520]  I got you, buddy.
[40:40.460 --> 40:41.740]  Meet you, amigo.
[40:42.080 --> 40:42.340]  There it is.
[40:43.800 --> 40:45.000]  We'll do it.
[40:46.160 --> 40:46.680]  Intimidation.
[40:50.900 --> 40:54.860]  I like how many times I've done these heists without understanding anything about the plot.
[40:55.180 --> 40:56.780]  I've never listened to it.
[40:56.880 --> 40:58.200]  I don't want to know.
[40:58.340 --> 40:58.880]  I don't know.
[40:59.020 --> 41:01.220]  I don't want to know a goddamn thing about what we're doing.
[41:01.400 --> 41:02.420]  I just want to do it.
[41:02.580 --> 41:03.120]  That's it.
[41:04.160 --> 41:05.040]  Don't want to know it.
[41:06.640 --> 41:07.900]  Don't tell me why.
[41:08.040 --> 41:09.180]  Just let me do it.
[41:11.320 --> 41:12.200]  Oh, shit.
[41:13.220 --> 41:13.960]  Cops are coming.
[41:15.620 --> 41:17.220]  Oh, Andrew, if you can hide.
[41:17.500 --> 41:18.680]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[41:21.400 --> 41:22.780]  I'm gonna get away from that helicopter.
[41:23.140 --> 41:23.520]  They're coming this way.
[41:23.640 --> 41:24.840]  They're coming this way, Andrew.
[41:26.660 --> 41:27.660]  Don't roll it.
[41:27.800 --> 41:28.500]  Oh, Andrew.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.220]  Oh, it's gonna be tight.
[41:31.500 --> 41:31.560]  Nope.
[41:32.920 --> 41:34.980]  All right, go off-road.
[41:36.780 --> 41:37.340]  Where are...
[41:37.340 --> 41:38.280]  Oh, my God.
[41:38.860 --> 41:40.260]  Oh, you got precious cargo.
[41:40.260 --> 41:43.940]  To be honest, this truck is not the best choice for what we're doing.
[41:44.220 --> 41:45.420]  It was all we had, man.
[41:45.640 --> 41:47.040]  Yeah, I'm not blaming anyone.
[41:47.040 --> 41:49.500]  Every time you have a bomb, Nick...
[41:49.500 --> 41:50.980]  Oh, no.
[41:52.720 --> 41:53.560]  You're good, you're good.
[41:53.620 --> 41:53.800]  Hey, come back.
[41:54.300 --> 41:54.840]  Hey, wait.
[41:55.740 --> 41:57.420]  Come back. The cops are on us.
[41:57.960 --> 41:58.860]  Bitch, you left us.
[41:59.100 --> 41:59.560]  Yeah, bitch.
[42:01.100 --> 42:02.680]  There you go. There you go.
[42:02.700 --> 42:03.300]  No, you fool.
[42:04.640 --> 42:05.360]  Get in.
[42:06.000 --> 42:06.800]  All right, man.
[42:08.180 --> 42:09.940]  What happened to backseat buddies, Nick?
[42:10.120 --> 42:11.200]  They're right on top of us, Andrew.
[42:11.480 --> 42:12.200]  All right, I'm coming back.
[42:15.140 --> 42:16.740]  What are you doing, Andrew, son?
[42:17.040 --> 42:19.000]  Trying to get away from these fucking cops.
[42:19.200 --> 42:20.440]  I'm doing the objective.
[42:21.960 --> 42:23.100]  Did it say come down here?
[42:23.400 --> 42:26.860]  Did it say you guys be fucking backseat buddies?
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.600]  What have you done to us?
[42:31.820 --> 42:32.320]  Oh, no.
[42:32.780 --> 42:33.800]  What have you done?
[42:34.020 --> 42:34.820]  Oh, one sec.
[42:34.840 --> 42:35.360]  What do we do?
[42:35.400 --> 42:37.600]  One sec. All our wheels are elevated.
[42:38.600 --> 42:40.200]  I shot down the pilot.
[42:40.800 --> 42:41.200]  Oh.
[42:45.480 --> 42:46.480]  The transponder locked.
[42:46.480 --> 42:47.760]  I don't know what that means.
[42:48.060 --> 42:48.560]  I don't know.
[42:48.800 --> 42:49.780]  We ran out of time.
[42:50.240 --> 42:50.400]  Yeah.
[42:52.760 --> 42:56.340]  Turns out a timed mission rolling around on a rock in the ocean.
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.000]  Yeah, the rock was the problem of all the things.
[43:00.220 --> 43:01.220]  That was the issue.
[43:01.700 --> 43:02.760]  You think we were the issue?
[43:03.060 --> 43:04.520]  I didn't say that.
[43:05.420 --> 43:07.220]  It seems like you implied it.
[43:07.420 --> 43:08.800]  You were throwing shade at backseat buddies.
[43:09.320 --> 43:12.940]  I was throwing shade at the backseat buddies not being able to stay in the backseat.
[43:13.100 --> 43:13.320]  What?
[43:13.580 --> 43:13.920]  Wait.
[43:14.700 --> 43:15.940]  We're back here on the boat.
[43:17.500 --> 43:18.380]  Jesus Christ.
[43:19.720 --> 43:21.840]  Wait, this isn't before we detect the others.
[43:22.600 --> 43:23.700]  No, it's after.
[43:23.920 --> 43:25.820]  We just have to scorn him all the way.
[43:26.560 --> 43:29.020]  And we're just going straight to land.
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.260]  Oh, you don't want to go a fun way that's so circumnavigating the entire map?
[43:36.620 --> 43:37.740]  It was really fun, though.
[43:38.320 --> 43:38.360]  Skip.
[43:38.420 --> 43:38.800]  Can we skip?
[43:38.860 --> 43:39.200]  Skip.
[43:39.440 --> 43:39.880]  Skip.
[43:40.060 --> 43:41.360]  We know his shitty life story.
[43:43.780 --> 43:44.740]  Andrew, skip it.
[43:50.990 --> 43:54.050]  I will turn this Xbox off and end this heist for all of us.
[43:57.050 --> 43:59.090]  I will take this heist home.
[43:59.910 --> 44:00.390]  Okay.
[44:01.990 --> 44:04.670]  Don't take off right away.
[44:05.890 --> 44:06.950]  It's a good rule of thumb.
[44:09.350 --> 44:10.310]  I need...
[44:10.310 --> 44:11.230]  I need a...
[44:11.230 --> 44:12.290]  Why am I...
[44:12.290 --> 44:13.790]  Why am I piloting the boat?
[44:14.850 --> 44:16.790]  Because they couldn't trust Andrew anymore.
[44:16.930 --> 44:17.150]  Wow.
[44:17.290 --> 44:17.810]  All right, Gavin.
[44:18.670 --> 44:19.230]  Me and you, I guess.
[44:19.230 --> 44:21.290]  I have time to go for a poo while this happens.
[44:22.810 --> 44:23.570]  In the back?
[44:23.730 --> 44:24.070]  Probably.
[44:24.310 --> 44:24.450]  Andrew.
[44:24.530 --> 44:24.870]  Oh, shit.
[44:24.950 --> 44:25.730]  I'm getting shot.
[44:26.390 --> 44:27.010]  Okay, let's go.
[44:32.460 --> 44:34.760]  Are we just getting to land?
[44:34.960 --> 44:36.800]  Are we getting rid of these guys and they're going to land?
[44:37.160 --> 44:39.340]  Can somebody take out the helicopter?
[44:40.820 --> 44:41.540]  Yeah, one sec.
[44:45.250 --> 44:46.070]  Or maybe not.
[44:46.370 --> 44:47.110]  Okay, so the...
[44:47.110 --> 44:48.430]  I can once we get on land.
[44:48.990 --> 44:50.890]  It's an eight minute timer and you failed.
[44:51.190 --> 44:53.330]  I can't pull out my...
[44:53.330 --> 44:55.070]  Rocket launcher here.
[44:55.170 --> 44:57.530]  But I can't just stand up.
[45:00.390 --> 45:02.270]  I don't think we were seated at...
[45:03.950 --> 45:06.190]  The stand up button is the dive out button.
[45:07.050 --> 45:08.390]  Yeah, that's what happened to me too.
[45:09.410 --> 45:10.770]  Hold on, I'll get it from land.
[45:12.750 --> 45:13.190]  Oh, Gavin.
[45:14.530 --> 45:15.110]  Nice job.
[45:15.150 --> 45:15.550]  It's gone.
[45:15.970 --> 45:18.050]  Here, I'm picking up the pieces.
[45:18.510 --> 45:19.150]  Oh, Nick.
[45:19.290 --> 45:19.630]  Perfect.
[45:23.500 --> 45:24.920]  Can you kill these guys?
[45:26.140 --> 45:26.800]  Or are you taking a shit?
[45:27.400 --> 45:27.500]  Okay.
[45:27.820 --> 45:31.320]  No, I tried to see if I could speed poo, but I just don't think it's going to happen.
[45:31.820 --> 45:33.000]  Here, Andrew, you can run.
[45:33.080 --> 45:33.700]  Oh, he's alive.
[45:33.840 --> 45:34.300]  He's alive.
[45:34.440 --> 45:35.060]  He's alive.
[45:35.240 --> 45:35.860]  He's alive.
[45:35.900 --> 45:37.120]  Did he fall down and get back up?
[45:38.580 --> 45:39.500]  I want to call Lester.
[45:39.700 --> 45:40.460]  Just get rid of my...
[45:40.460 --> 45:41.120]  Oh, shit.
[45:44.280 --> 45:46.140]  Andrew just ran into the forest.
[45:46.280 --> 45:47.600]  Yeah, I'm just going to hop in a car.
[45:47.940 --> 45:49.360]  I'm not doing the water thing.
[45:49.360 --> 45:51.260]  I'm pretty sure that's how this is going to go.
[45:51.260 --> 45:52.280]  First spotted Bigfoot.
[45:52.440 --> 45:55.360]  Just some dude on a heist running off into the woods.
[45:55.840 --> 45:57.360]  I'm getting a phone call and it says...
[45:57.760 --> 45:59.340]  It, like, guesses the name of who it is.
[45:59.400 --> 45:59.660]  It says...
[46:01.700 --> 46:02.500]  Pape Dawson.
[46:05.660 --> 46:06.940]  We got dogs in here.
[46:08.100 --> 46:08.640]  Oh, fuck.
[46:08.700 --> 46:09.840]  Hey, Pape, how's it going?
[46:10.700 --> 46:11.480]  Hey, Pape.
[46:16.140 --> 46:16.940]  Pape Dawson.
[46:18.940 --> 46:19.720]  That company?
[46:19.920 --> 46:20.700]  Or is that, like, a man?
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.540]  Oh, we talking Pape?
[46:25.060 --> 46:25.700]  That's how Jet Skis work, right?
[46:25.700 --> 46:26.360]  Pape and I go way back.
[46:26.440 --> 46:26.520]  Yeah.
[46:28.300 --> 46:28.820]  Oh, shit.
[46:28.940 --> 46:30.820]  I gave Pape your number.
[46:30.920 --> 46:31.720]  I didn't think he'd actually call.
[46:34.100 --> 46:34.740]  Excuse me.
[46:36.080 --> 46:36.700]  Pardon me.
[46:38.260 --> 46:39.160]  Oh, is that Eric ahead?
[46:39.700 --> 46:40.120]  It is.
[46:40.360 --> 46:41.000]  Oh, let's do it.
[46:41.340 --> 46:42.400]  You just went up on the shore.
[46:42.620 --> 46:43.280]  I'm up on land.
[46:44.040 --> 46:45.400]  I got to take out these cops.
[46:47.920 --> 46:48.760]  That was close.
[46:49.760 --> 46:51.540]  I expected to land on you.
[46:52.340 --> 46:53.620]  Okay, so Avi's here.
[46:53.840 --> 46:55.700]  We just need... we need to get a car.
[46:55.800 --> 46:56.720]  We got to get out of here.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.340]  The problem is we keep going further in.
[46:59.700 --> 47:01.080]  It's going to be cops in boats.
[47:01.680 --> 47:03.380]  I'll go see if I can steal a cop car.
[47:03.580 --> 47:04.900]  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
[47:05.700 --> 47:06.460]  Andrew, is that you?
[47:06.640 --> 47:06.800]  Yeah.
[47:06.940 --> 47:07.000]  In the car?
[47:07.500 --> 47:08.340]  Fuck, yes.
[47:08.840 --> 47:11.740]  There it is.
[47:12.160 --> 47:12.320]  Yep.
[47:12.960 --> 47:15.960]  Do you have enough seats for all of us or no?
[47:16.160 --> 47:17.300]  If not, go without me.
[47:17.300 --> 47:19.800]  I mean, I'm up at the bridge.
[47:19.800 --> 47:20.620]  I'm going to just grab a car.
[47:20.760 --> 47:21.260]  All right, cool.
[47:21.440 --> 47:22.740]  All right, let's do it.
[47:22.940 --> 47:23.160]  All right.
[47:23.620 --> 47:24.640]  I'm up the road.
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.900]  I'm up the road by the bridge.
[47:26.620 --> 47:27.940]  Let's see if you can get in also.
[47:28.140 --> 47:28.260]  Yep.
[47:28.440 --> 47:29.940]  I got a backseat for you, Nick.
[47:30.820 --> 47:32.100]  I think it's a four-seat.
[47:32.160 --> 47:32.680]  I think that's it.
[47:32.720 --> 47:33.380]  There's a seat in the middle.
[47:34.100 --> 47:35.180]  There's a fucking headrest.
[47:35.280 --> 47:37.120]  I don't think they do middle seats in this game.
[47:37.320 --> 47:38.660]  Then why is it in the car?
[47:39.640 --> 47:40.000]  Fictional.
[47:40.940 --> 47:42.100]  Yeah, just go drive.
[47:42.220 --> 47:42.560]  I'll be there.
[47:42.680 --> 47:43.620]  That is insane.
[47:44.500 --> 47:44.860]  I'm ready.
[47:44.860 --> 47:47.280]  Listen, heisters don't share cars.
[47:47.340 --> 47:48.740]  Oh, there's my ride.
[47:49.580 --> 47:54.580]  Now, when we have to lose the cops here, is there anything we can do to assist, Andrew?
[47:54.660 --> 47:55.140]  Or what do you think?
[47:55.880 --> 47:56.920]  Sorry, I'm just...
[47:56.920 --> 48:01.080]  I'm imagining this is one person extending both hands out the window.
[48:01.640 --> 48:03.220]  It's one very long...
[48:03.220 --> 48:03.920]  Oh, tractor.
[48:05.720 --> 48:07.340]  Oh, Gavin.
[48:08.180 --> 48:09.500]  Nick is right behind us.
[48:10.580 --> 48:11.740]  What do you think that grenade is for?
[48:11.740 --> 48:15.840]  I heard you use a little of it, you motherfucker.
[48:17.820 --> 48:19.200]  Oh my god!
[48:19.640 --> 48:20.280]  Nick!
[48:20.360 --> 48:20.820]  Oh!
[48:22.300 --> 48:22.980]  What's up?
[48:23.980 --> 48:25.640]  Didn't think this had that much power.
[48:27.960 --> 48:28.600]  Gavin!
[48:33.160 --> 48:35.140]  So we got four minutes left.
[48:35.320 --> 48:36.560]  We have to lose the cops.
[48:37.660 --> 48:40.960]  I wonder if you get off this winding road,
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.900]  when it's like, oh, you got to lose the police and they start coming for you.
[48:44.200 --> 48:47.100]  I wonder if you just kind of barge it, go past and through them,
[48:47.220 --> 48:49.300]  and then see if we can lose them in the hills somewhere.
[48:49.620 --> 48:50.400]  I'm not really sure.
[48:50.520 --> 48:52.780]  I assume we can't lose them this early, because it's not flashing or anything.
[48:53.020 --> 48:53.400]  No, no, no.
[48:53.520 --> 48:56.520]  They're going to tell us in a minute, like, hey, you got to lose the cops.
[48:57.040 --> 48:59.520]  I think we just got to keep moving forward in that instance.
[49:00.560 --> 49:02.040]  We'll evaluate once...
[49:02.040 --> 49:04.580]  If I get into the hills, that's the move, for sure.
[49:06.160 --> 49:07.020]  I threw an indicator down...
[49:07.020 --> 49:08.220]  We have three and a half minutes, though.
[49:08.620 --> 49:10.940]  I threw an indicator down of where we're supposed to go.
[49:11.300 --> 49:13.640]  Hopefully, when the yellow one disappears here in a minute,
[49:14.200 --> 49:17.240]  then we know we're close, or whatever.
[49:17.820 --> 49:18.220]  Good call.
[49:19.460 --> 49:20.620]  Gaming the GPS.
[49:21.040 --> 49:21.360]  Trying.
[49:24.240 --> 49:25.840]  Fuck, it went away.
[49:26.300 --> 49:28.320]  Did you memorize where it was?
[49:28.380 --> 49:29.880]  No, it took my indicator with me.
[49:31.140 --> 49:31.660]  Oh, don't...
[49:31.660 --> 49:32.920]  Oh, Andrew, I don't know about this.
[49:33.340 --> 49:34.020]  Nah, this is great.
[49:38.630 --> 49:40.270]  The chopper, the chopper, the chopper.
[49:40.270 --> 49:41.330]  Yeah, the chopper's view.
[49:41.790 --> 49:43.210]  Alright, should we take out the chopper?
[49:43.330 --> 49:44.050]  Yeah, we have to.
[49:44.430 --> 49:44.950]  Alright, I'll take it out.
[49:45.070 --> 49:45.490]  I'll do it from...
[49:53.770 --> 49:55.310]  Didn't quite lock on, but it didn't matter.
[49:55.430 --> 49:56.150]  Alright, Gavin, get back in.
[49:57.710 --> 49:58.510]  Oh, there's another one.
[49:58.690 --> 49:59.110]  Another one.
[49:59.230 --> 50:01.190]  I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[50:03.050 --> 50:03.630]  I got it.
[50:04.790 --> 50:05.070]  Awesome.
[50:05.690 --> 50:06.030]  Let's go.
[50:06.670 --> 50:07.170]  Alright, let's go.
[50:07.950 --> 50:08.950]  Oh, goddammit, another one.
[50:09.310 --> 50:11.110]  Yeah, it's really evading.
[50:11.830 --> 50:12.050]  Yeah.
[50:12.650 --> 50:13.810]  Alright, you keep going, I'll do it.
[50:14.830 --> 50:16.690]  Yeah, but are you gonna get the cops on you?
[50:16.690 --> 50:18.970]  Yeah, stop, don't, we just gotta evade them.
[50:19.910 --> 50:20.530]  Okay, fair enough.
[50:21.710 --> 50:22.490]  Okay, we made it.
[50:27.200 --> 50:28.080]  Keep it going.
[50:28.280 --> 50:29.280]  Oh, there you go, Andrew.
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.300]  Is your thing just to lose the cops?
[50:34.320 --> 50:34.440]  Yeah.
[50:35.200 --> 50:36.680]  Okay, mine is just to help.
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.340]  Goddammit, I was on the other side of a hill.
[50:41.560 --> 50:42.380]  That's such bullshit.
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.380]  It wasn't, it's a helicopter.
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.680]  Yeah, they see over hills.
[50:47.180 --> 50:47.900]  But it was...
[50:47.900 --> 50:48.660]  Oh, get onto that.
[50:49.700 --> 50:50.820]  I think it's gonna be too late.
[50:51.560 --> 50:51.960]  Fuck!
[50:52.120 --> 50:52.500]  We're alright.
[50:52.700 --> 50:54.100]  Oh, shit, bus piece.
[50:58.980 --> 50:59.920]  God dang it.
[51:05.810 --> 51:06.210]  Nice!
[51:08.790 --> 51:09.810]  Cruising with players.
[51:10.010 --> 51:10.790]  Hell yeah, baby.
[51:11.130 --> 51:12.530]  Oh, shit, Andrew, where are we gonna go?
[51:13.750 --> 51:14.950]  We just gotta go left.
[51:18.090 --> 51:19.250]  Nick, what does your thing say?
[51:19.770 --> 51:20.410]  Does it say lose the cops?
[51:20.410 --> 51:22.210]  It says help take him to the drop-off.
[51:23.530 --> 51:25.110]  Oh, fuck, I am getting lit up.
[51:28.850 --> 51:29.710]  God damn it.
[51:29.830 --> 51:30.950]  We're not gonna get it, fuck.
[51:32.470 --> 51:33.930]  What do we need to do differently?
[51:34.130 --> 51:34.970]  Like, what are we missing?
[51:45.850 --> 51:46.490]  Oh, dear.
[51:47.190 --> 51:47.470]  Uh-oh.
[51:48.210 --> 51:48.590]  Uh-oh.
[51:53.790 --> 51:54.530]  I got him.
[52:01.220 --> 52:02.380]  I just don't know what to...
[52:02.380 --> 52:03.760]  I don't know what to do.
[52:04.240 --> 52:05.020]  You know what I mean?
[52:05.020 --> 52:06.500]  I don't understand how we're still on it.
[52:06.980 --> 52:07.800]  Yeah, I don't...
[52:07.800 --> 52:08.940]  We got 30 seconds left.
[52:09.040 --> 52:11.100]  I just don't know what we're supposed to do.
[52:16.750 --> 52:17.950]  Snapped my back on a tree.
[52:18.150 --> 52:19.110]  Yeah, we're gonna have to do it again.
[52:19.330 --> 52:20.850]  What are we doing wrong?
[52:22.050 --> 52:22.450]  It's not...
[52:22.450 --> 52:23.670]  I don't think we're doing anything wrong.
[52:23.730 --> 52:24.730]  We're just not evading it.
[52:24.890 --> 52:26.170]  Like, it's just we're failing at that.
[52:26.270 --> 52:28.010]  I don't think there's a strategic issue.
[52:28.530 --> 52:30.230]  I'm almost out of the cop's view.
[52:30.410 --> 52:31.290]  I don't know if you guys are.
[52:31.590 --> 52:32.510]  Okay, we got two seconds.
[52:32.630 --> 52:33.450]  So do you think we can do it?
[52:34.290 --> 52:35.390]  Oh, I think the time ran out.
[52:36.410 --> 52:37.810]  I don't remember this being hot.
[52:38.230 --> 52:40.630]  Maybe we're being too aggressive trying to take down the choppers.
[52:41.350 --> 52:42.070]  I got an idea.
[52:42.890 --> 52:43.370]  What are you thinking?
[52:43.710 --> 52:44.770]  I'm gonna get us a helicopter.
[52:45.470 --> 52:45.870]  How?
[52:46.010 --> 52:46.950]  Take to the skies.
[52:47.910 --> 52:48.290]  Okay.
[52:48.810 --> 52:49.570]  I mean, do it.
[52:49.610 --> 52:50.650]  Just go without us.
[52:51.510 --> 52:52.210]  Yeah, I'm gonna go...
[52:52.210 --> 52:52.910]  Like, I'll just...
[52:52.910 --> 52:54.790]  I'll head to the airport, grab one.
[52:55.430 --> 52:56.070]  Or could we...
[52:56.070 --> 52:57.350]  Could we take him to the airport?
[52:57.710 --> 52:59.670]  Where are we in relation to the airport from this?
[53:00.210 --> 53:00.930]  Pretty far.
[53:01.910 --> 53:02.210]  Let's see.
[53:02.350 --> 53:02.710]  Northwest.
[53:06.090 --> 53:06.670]  Fuck, man.
[53:06.750 --> 53:08.090]  I just like...
[53:08.090 --> 53:09.690]  I don't know what...
[53:09.690 --> 53:10.130]  I don't know.
[53:10.410 --> 53:10.770]  I'm not sure.
[53:11.070 --> 53:11.410]  Oh, we have to...
[53:11.410 --> 53:12.010]  Yeah, it's pretty far.
[53:12.130 --> 53:12.290]  Okay.
[53:17.930 --> 53:19.910]  I think Nick's gonna drive the boat this time.
[53:20.350 --> 53:21.210]  Oh, no, it might be...
[53:21.210 --> 53:21.270]  Uh-oh.
[53:21.670 --> 53:21.830]  Shit.
[53:22.730 --> 53:25.390]  Oh, every time I see this cutscene, I need more of a poo.
[53:27.390 --> 53:29.530]  Don't answer the phone to Lester Crest.
[53:29.850 --> 53:32.290]  How do we always end up having such long...
[53:32.290 --> 53:32.690]  Let's go.
[53:33.690 --> 53:33.970]  Video.
[53:38.930 --> 53:40.670]  Am I really driving the fucking boat again?
[53:41.490 --> 53:43.330]  Do you guys want in the boat or you want in the jet ski?
[53:43.970 --> 53:44.950]  I'll hop in the boat this time.
[53:45.750 --> 53:46.830]  I'll go in the jet ski.
[53:47.530 --> 53:47.730]  Okay.
[53:49.370 --> 53:50.530]  I've had my jet ski before.
[53:50.550 --> 53:50.790]  And Gavin...
[53:51.850 --> 53:52.410]  I'm in the boat.
[53:53.310 --> 53:53.470]  Okay.
[53:54.170 --> 53:54.790]  All right, I'm in.
[53:54.970 --> 53:55.250]  Somebody...
[53:55.250 --> 53:56.890]  Oh, you gotta take out the helicopter.
[53:57.170 --> 53:58.090]  Somebody has to take out the helicopter.
[53:58.310 --> 53:58.810]  Okay, I'll do it.
[53:58.890 --> 53:59.210]  I'll do it.
[54:02.840 --> 54:03.240]  You get it, Nick?
[54:03.240 --> 54:04.160]  Thank you.
[54:04.300 --> 54:04.740]  Yep.
[54:07.480 --> 54:08.920]  Oh, what the fuck?
[54:09.720 --> 54:10.160]  Jesus.
[54:10.440 --> 54:11.360]  What happened?
[54:11.520 --> 54:12.440]  We went sideways.
[54:14.320 --> 54:15.520]  Oh, you're leaving.
[54:15.740 --> 54:16.600]  I'm not leaving.
[54:16.700 --> 54:17.440]  Shut up.
[54:17.520 --> 54:18.340]  Now I'm gonna leave you.
[54:21.160 --> 54:24.100]  Well, to be fair, the last time somebody did that, they just left.
[54:24.160 --> 54:24.780]  And that was Andrew.
[54:24.940 --> 54:25.360]  Yeah, that's true.
[54:29.980 --> 54:31.320]  I should get better on the...
[54:31.320 --> 54:31.880]  More on the...
[54:34.620 --> 54:35.720]  I'm gonna go...
[54:39.060 --> 54:39.660]  What?
[54:40.200 --> 54:40.500]  What?
[54:41.560 --> 54:42.560]  Well, wait.
[54:43.320 --> 54:43.660]  What?
[54:45.160 --> 54:46.600]  Are you not in the boat?
[54:47.260 --> 54:49.740]  He's like, I gotta get a better seat.
[54:50.560 --> 54:51.700]  How'd that work, man?
[54:51.920 --> 54:52.320]  Boat.
[54:52.900 --> 54:54.480]  Will you kill this fucking cop already?
[54:55.180 --> 54:55.460]  Where?
[54:55.900 --> 54:56.020]  Where?
[54:56.280 --> 54:57.060]  Vaden, Vaden, Vaden.
[54:57.300 --> 54:59.480]  It's on the map.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.740]  Next to him is he laughing.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.120]  I'm laughing, man.
[55:02.160 --> 55:03.780]  I have tears in my fucking eyes.
[55:04.920 --> 55:05.800]  Oh, boy.
[55:06.060 --> 55:07.000]  All right, better seat yet?
[55:07.480 --> 55:08.460]  Get the RPG out.
[55:08.640 --> 55:09.360]  Grenade launcher out.
[55:09.720 --> 55:10.680]  And I'm anchored in.
[55:10.860 --> 55:11.340]  Fuck you.
[55:11.340 --> 55:11.620]  Nice.
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.680]  We're just gonna go to this first dock and see if we can make something happen.
[55:19.260 --> 55:20.140]  Are we...
[55:20.140 --> 55:21.140]  Are we able to dock here?
[55:22.940 --> 55:24.240]  Don't be such a dock tease.
[55:25.040 --> 55:26.340]  I don't know if we can.
[55:26.980 --> 55:28.600]  Eat the food, moron.
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.620]  It's Nick talking to his kid like that.
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.300]  That's fucked up.
[55:32.580 --> 55:33.380]  Oh, yeah.
[55:35.080 --> 55:36.220]  They don't respond well to that.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.100]  I guess we'll just go here.
[55:39.060 --> 55:39.920]  You guys figured out a car yet?
[55:41.400 --> 55:41.860]  Oh, this one.
[55:42.000 --> 55:42.360]  We're approaching.
[55:43.740 --> 55:45.000]  See if I can get Avi up to the road.
[55:45.080 --> 55:46.500]  He's way down here for some reason.
[55:46.780 --> 55:47.720]  See if we can get a decent.
[55:48.940 --> 55:51.740]  Gavin, if you want to grab a second car, that might be a good idea.
[55:53.180 --> 55:54.540]  All right, don't come too fast.
[55:54.640 --> 55:54.980]  We're right here.
[55:55.320 --> 55:55.640]  Got it.
[55:55.720 --> 55:56.040]  Got it.
[55:59.960 --> 56:00.280]  Yeah...
[56:02.300 --> 56:02.620]  Shagging.
[56:04.200 --> 56:05.360]  Don't shit too fast, Gavin.
[56:06.120 --> 56:07.040]  Oh, you hit!
[56:07.380 --> 56:08.240]  Gavin, let's do it again.
[56:10.680 --> 56:12.300]  Hey, hey, I hope you shit your pants.
[56:13.620 --> 56:14.640]  I'm going to.
[56:14.800 --> 56:15.680]  I hope you shit your pants.
[56:16.200 --> 56:16.920]  I hope you do it.
[56:17.700 --> 56:18.420]  I hope you do it.
[56:18.440 --> 56:20.480]  I can't believe he was just right there on that side.
[56:20.780 --> 56:21.880]  I hope you shit your pants.
[56:22.560 --> 56:23.220]  I can't believe it.
[56:23.220 --> 56:24.140]  I hope you shit your pants.
[56:24.240 --> 56:24.800]  You're going to do it.
[56:24.880 --> 56:25.560]  You're going to shit your pants.
[56:25.800 --> 56:27.940]  We're going to watch the cutscenes again, and you're going to shit your pants.
[56:27.940 --> 56:31.000]  I can't believe that you did it.
[56:31.000 --> 56:31.220]  Oh.
[56:32.700 --> 56:41.840]  I thought I'd give the car a little bump, but I just couldn't slow down.
[56:43.380 --> 56:45.620]  And he was there, he was right in front of me.
[56:46.920 --> 56:47.620]  I'm going to shit.
[56:48.240 --> 56:48.500]  Good.
[56:49.080 --> 56:51.060]  I'm going to piss my pants.
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.020]  Good, you too.
[56:52.860 --> 56:54.620]  I didn't do anything that time.
[56:56.440 --> 56:57.400]  Sins of the father.
[57:00.260 --> 57:04.920]  It looked like he went flying into the ocean.
[57:07.300 --> 57:08.960]  Andrew's got the boat this time.
[57:14.120 --> 57:15.000]  My butt.
[57:17.780 --> 57:22.440]  If I just stay in the hut, do I get a wanted level?
[57:23.340 --> 57:24.100]  Yeah, I think so.
[57:24.320 --> 57:26.020]  Yeah, it's a wanted level.
[57:26.280 --> 57:30.240]  I think it's associated with all of us together.
[57:30.260 --> 57:32.000]  That was a poo.
[57:32.600 --> 57:32.960]  Good.
[57:33.060 --> 57:33.660]  This is on you.
[57:34.100 --> 57:34.720]  We would have beat it.
[57:34.780 --> 57:35.320]  This is your fault.
[57:35.820 --> 57:37.840]  Andrew, can you back up a little bit?
[57:37.880 --> 57:38.280]  I want to jump in.
[57:38.680 --> 57:38.840]  Yep.
[57:40.400 --> 57:41.140]  Oh, okay.
[57:41.260 --> 57:42.200]  I guess I won't.
[57:42.500 --> 57:43.120]  I'm gonna...
[57:43.120 --> 57:44.680]  You guys go, I'll take the jet ski.
[57:45.060 --> 57:45.260]  Okay.
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.100]  All right, take it out of the chopper.
[57:48.000 --> 57:48.600]  Oh, shit.
[57:50.020 --> 57:50.520]  Oh, shit.
[57:52.300 --> 57:53.780]  We're getting to land immediately.
[57:53.820 --> 57:54.920]  For Christ's sake.
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.420]  There's tears in my fucking eyes.
[57:58.520 --> 57:59.060]  There you go.
[58:03.080 --> 58:03.600]  Gasploosh.
[58:10.480 --> 58:12.620]  There's surely better places to get off.
[58:12.720 --> 58:13.780]  Yeah, this is awful.
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.660]  You want to go the way up to the road?
[58:16.140 --> 58:16.440]  You can drive.
[58:18.400 --> 58:19.440]  Get trapped.
[58:20.760 --> 58:22.220]  There's nowhere to go.
[58:22.600 --> 58:23.500]  Up the hill.
[58:23.880 --> 58:25.940]  There's a bunch of parked cars up here.
[58:28.800 --> 58:29.900]  Okay, I'll get off.
[58:29.940 --> 58:30.760]  Okay, I'll get off.
[58:32.880 --> 58:33.560]  There you go.
[58:33.960 --> 58:34.680]  Oh, God.
[58:35.420 --> 58:36.200]  Oh, God.
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.820]  You're still laughing at this.
[58:40.040 --> 58:41.080]  Oh, dude, it was so...
[58:41.800 --> 58:43.920]  Just the angle I had of it, it was incredible.
[58:44.180 --> 58:48.240]  When you smashed in between the two cars.
[58:51.460 --> 58:52.340]  Oh, God.
[58:52.800 --> 58:54.400]  I'm getting us a nice van if we need it.
[58:54.800 --> 58:55.560]  Oh, it hurts.
[58:57.140 --> 58:58.300]  I'm gonna grab another car.
[59:01.600 --> 59:02.860]  They can't catch all of us.
[59:06.880 --> 59:08.580]  It's fine, we can't evade them.
[59:17.860 --> 59:18.620]  I'm getting us a van.
[59:19.320 --> 59:19.700]  Hang on.
[59:21.880 --> 59:22.980]  All right, Gavin, let's go.
[59:23.420 --> 59:24.540]  All right, we'll run interference.
[59:29.750 --> 59:30.430]  Oh, man.
[59:30.550 --> 59:31.190]  Oh, hang on.
[59:31.310 --> 59:31.630]  I'm sorry.
[59:31.830 --> 59:32.950]  You keep going, keep going, keep going.
[59:33.430 --> 59:33.870]  I got you.
[59:34.270 --> 59:36.110]  I hurt very badly.
[59:36.130 --> 59:36.410]  I'm ready.
[59:41.820 --> 59:42.820]  I finished him off.
[59:50.280 --> 59:51.420]  Oh, you wanted it so bad.
[59:51.440 --> 59:52.140]  I saw that.
[59:52.440 --> 59:52.680]  Oh, shit.
[59:52.820 --> 59:53.300]  Oh, you missed.
[59:53.400 --> 59:53.720]  I got him.
[59:53.980 --> 59:55.280]  Andrew, we're just not...
[59:55.280 --> 59:58.160]  We're not gonna make it just because Gavin's driving like a fucking maniac.
[59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.880]  Just following the rules of GTA, damn it.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.920]  Oh, you missed that one and I did too.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.700]  Ah, shit.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.520]  Nicely done.
[01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:14.970]  Oh, I'm on it.
[01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:16.590]  Oh, nice.
[01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.130]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:23.710]  I just crossed the aquatic barricade.
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.590]  Oh, you continued on the normal path?
[01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:34.030]  I wish there was a shortcut to get over there.
[01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:34.890]  Boy, there's not.
[01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.170]  Nice hit.
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:40.790]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.470]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.410]  Thank you.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.720]  This guy's chatting some real shit.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.340]  Yeah, he just keeps saying stuff.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.020]  Talking about brains and jaws.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:58.840]  Futurama?
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:00:59.340]  Whoa.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.420]  Oh.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.040]  Oh, that was close.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.060]  That was cool.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.740]  How you doing, Andrew?
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.140]  I'm, um, uh, moving.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.440]  I'm on a road now.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.920]  Andrew's on a road.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.220]  Seems like the other way might have been faster.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.040]  But you're good.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:19.500]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.640]  Don't worry about it.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.480]  I'm just following the marker that I put down for myself.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.440]  Oh, what the?
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.000]  Uh, how do I get back over there?
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.580]  You're on the wrong side, man!
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.160]  Shit.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.480]  Oh, the choppers!
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.500]  Oh, we get in the tunnel!
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.260]  The tunnel!
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.500]  The tunnel!
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.020]  Oh, there's cops on the other end, though.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.340]  Here, we'll just camp on this side.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.060]  Let's just keep going.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.640]  Yeah, you just have to keep going.
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.150]  Boy, I don't know.
[01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:55.770]  I don't know how to take this thing out, Gavin.
[01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.810]  What thing?
[01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:58.870]  The helicopter.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:04.010]  Okay, so we share a sight, I guess.
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.530]  Oh, no we don't.
[01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.690]  I just got caught from behind.
[01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:06.490]  That sounded weird.
[01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:08.550]  Should we go off-road?
[01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:10.510]  I mean, you're gonna have to.
[01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:11.810]  We got four minutes and...
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:13.150]  I don't know, man.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:13.790]  Oh, oh, oh!
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:14.690]  Here we go.
[01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:15.190]  Okay.
[01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:18.150]  Just be careful about getting too...
[01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.430]  Okay.
[01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:21.030]  There you go.
[01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:22.510]  Helicopter's to your right.
[01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:23.810]  Hang a right, hang a right, hang a right!
[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:24.370]  There you go.
[01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:26.510]  There you go.
[01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:30.070]  Okay, dip, dip a little left.
[01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:32.850]  Helicopter's...
[01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.830]  Yeah, I know, but the helicopters are gonna turn around.
[01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:35.710]  There's a bike path.
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:39.490]  Helicopter's turning around.
[01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.090]  You're gonna have to duck down left.
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:42.150]  You're gonna have to.
[01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:45.470]  Helicopter's coming up behind us.
[01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:47.770]  You're gonna have to go further down the mountain to the left.
[01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.650]  Uh-oh.
[01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.130]  I mean, you're...
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.450]  Yes!
[01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:52.950]  Yes!
[01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:54.830]  Did you get it?
[01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:56.350]  Yeah, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.490]  Easy, easy, easy.
[01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.990]  There you go.
[01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.750]  No, nope.
[01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:01.350]  All right, flip it.
[01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:02.870]  Come on, come on.
[01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:08.850]  Cool.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.430]  We did it!
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:11.550]  Nick, get out of the way.
[01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:12.890]  I'm out of the way.
[01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:13.810]  He's backing up.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:14.830]  Oh!
[01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.110]  Yeah, Gavin's a classic back it in park job guy.
[01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.850]  Did it.
[01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:26.270]  Hell yeah!
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:27.250]  Hey!
[01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.990]  Good job, Gavin.
[01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:29.850]  There it is, Lester Crest.
[01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:33.290]  I'm helping Lester.
[01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:34.130]  Have you done it?
[01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:34.670]  What?
[01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:35.470]  Has he done it?
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:42.600]  Well, I don't have the Pacific Standard Frequency here.
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.680]  I don't have my tool.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.060]  Isn't that convenient?
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.340]  Oh, I'm annoyed by that.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:46.860]  I've got some tools.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.100]  Come on, let's throw me back at your place.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.100]  And don't worry, the transponder will be ready for the job.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:53.880]  I like that shirt.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:54.720]  His shirt?
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.880]  Yeah, we should sell his shirt.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.060]  We have a store now.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:03:59.920]  Hey!
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:01.060]  Interesting.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.320]  What if, uh, there's a page on our store just for us to get rid of shit we don't want?
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.660]  Just like a flea market?
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.340]  I have an old air fryer.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.440]  I got a nice chest of drawers that since I moved, I have no idea where to put.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.600]  But it was, it was like 800 bucks and I don't want to throw it away.
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.820]  So you want to sell it?
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.480]  So you want to sell it to a listener for $800?
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.740]  No, I'll sell it for 200.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:32.600]  Wow.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.020]  Ooh, only the finest.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.800]  What a bunch of fucking menaces outside of this little liquor store.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.280]  Well, well, we did it.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.140]  We did it.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.060]  Thanks for watching this heist. Gavin has to go shit.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.940]  So, uh, we appreciate you guys watching.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.460]  Go to, uh, Regulatrion.com, patreon.com slash regulation pod, uh, regulation.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.980]  If you didn't have to go, we could do the next part.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.480]  You have to shit and I do have to go.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.960]  And also you're, you were both half an hour late.
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.300]  Well, I was half an hour in advance late.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.560]  Wait, who was late?
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.580]  Oh, you were late, but only by two minutes.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.780]  But I can't, I put, I tack it onto the 30 minutes.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.940]  I was waiting for Gavin. I was not late.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:20.740]  I was here before Gavin.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:21.680]  You were late.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.200]  Hey, Gavin.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:23.800]  Yeah.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.680]  I'm on a scooter. Come get me.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:26.740]  Okay.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.420]  All right, guys, we'll see you next time.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.500]  Thanks for watching this heist.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.640]  Did it come out in 2024?
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.460]  Probably not.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:31.900]  Bye.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.060]  You didn't catch.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.140]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.320]  That was my Faggio.
