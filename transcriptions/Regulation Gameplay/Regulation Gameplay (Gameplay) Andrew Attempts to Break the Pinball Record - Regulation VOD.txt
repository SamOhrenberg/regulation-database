[00:00.000 --> 00:08.380]  What? Don't go live. Oh no! It's too late! It is. The earth is already shaking! Oh shit!
[00:11.180 --> 00:16.860]  That was very convincing. Gavin, that was great. You've been working on that. I believe it. Oh shit.
[00:18.400 --> 00:22.020]  I'm in my yell stuff at the beginning of recordings era for some reason.
[00:22.620 --> 00:27.820]  That's fun. It's always fun to yell at the beginning. And right before it starts go...
[00:28.580 --> 00:34.320]  Like to put a stop to it, I guess. Yeah, definitely to make me question everything in that moment.
[00:38.720 --> 00:45.020]  So, big stream. Anyway. It's a pinball stream because I realized that Earthshaker,
[00:45.400 --> 00:51.140]  the cabinet in our office, is in pinball FX. And I want to set the high score,
[00:51.260 --> 00:57.800]  which coincidentally was set by Eric this morning. I set the high score today. You can hear about it
[00:57.800 --> 01:05.360]  in two weeks on the podcast. I would love to be able to go back to 17-year-old Geoff,
[01:05.500 --> 01:10.900]  who's hanging out at the bowling alley in Mobile, Alabama. Theodore, Alabama.
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.620]  Playing this fucking Earthshaker pinball machine and thinking how great it is. And show him a video
[01:17.620 --> 01:24.220]  of him at 50 years old watching somebody from Canada play a virtual version of this video game
[01:24.220 --> 01:29.720]  while he talks on a computer to his friend from England and his two friends from Texas,
[01:29.900 --> 01:34.180]  which, by the way, is where he lives. I think my dick would have fell off. Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:34.460 --> 01:40.220]  This is... To hundreds of people watching. Yeah, no kidding. I might check out pinball FX.
[01:40.720 --> 01:47.540]  I hate paying for pinball. I love free play pinball. And this might be it for me, man. Like,
[01:47.620 --> 01:52.820]  I might jump on some pinball FX. I want to try to get the high score, but I also have a bunch of
[01:52.820 --> 01:57.680]  tables. I have various pinball games. I can do some deep diving into this. I'm excited. I should
[01:57.680 --> 02:02.900]  start now, I assume. Gavin, what were you saying? Well, I noticed, Derek, that when we were in the
[02:02.900 --> 02:08.980]  pinball museum, which is a video on our Patreon, all of the games were in free play and you still
[02:08.980 --> 02:16.920]  were quite miserable. They weren't in free play. I had to get coins and put them into the machine.
[02:17.200 --> 02:21.260]  What the fuck are you talking about? What are you talking about, Gavin? Oh, because you put the
[02:21.260 --> 02:27.380]  coins in. So for me, it was still free play. That's why. So anyway, starting to understand
[02:27.380 --> 02:32.840]  why Eric might have been miserable as he was walking around playing Gavin's mom with the coin.
[02:36.020 --> 02:42.560]  Can I have more quarters? Okay, Andrew, Earthshaker, I have the high score in.
[02:42.860 --> 02:47.060]  So now it's on you to try to beat it. It's 6.6 million, right? That's the high score.
[02:47.060 --> 02:54.880]  Yes, I've eclipsed. Let's do it. Good luck. Yeah, good luck. There's a shot. Yeah, yeah,
[02:54.960 --> 02:59.940]  you want to go. You want to ride the highway as much as you can. He's exactly right. Ride the
[02:59.940 --> 03:04.280]  highway as much as humanly possible. And if you find the sweet spot, you can just do it over and
[03:04.280 --> 03:11.260]  over again. Yep. Okay, well, bad start. Rough start. Yep. Usually my thumb, my left thumb will
[03:11.260 --> 03:18.060]  betray me around like the seventh or eighth time. Yeah, yeah. My son, you guys earlier, but
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.740]  my cousin who lives in Austin, wanted to see the regulation office. So
[03:24.720 --> 03:29.940]  came over and she saw it and she couldn't believe that there was pinball. Like, she's like,
[03:29.940 --> 03:36.740]  you guys just have pinball? And yeah, she's like, do you have to put quarters in it? Like, no,
[03:37.520 --> 03:44.920]  no, that would be insane. That would be crazy. I would hate it so much. I mean, if I had to
[03:44.920 --> 03:49.920]  Geoff's game, like Geoff could turn it off free play and you would have to put money in and start
[03:49.920 --> 03:55.760]  charging. I'm going to get the high score back and then I'm going to make it 50 cents a play.
[04:00.520 --> 04:04.380]  See Rob in the chat said I literally played this week ago at the arcade museum. I didn't
[04:04.380 --> 04:09.020]  know. Hell yeah. This is a great machine. This is a really good machine. It's crazy that this
[04:09.020 --> 04:14.460]  found its way into our lives. So we were in Las Vegas at the end of June, I guess,
[04:14.760 --> 04:19.100]  because I was throwing the first pitch out at a triple A ballgame. And then Gavin,
[04:19.400 --> 04:25.460]  low key, huge pinball fan has been for a while. So we took him to the Pinball Hall of Fame. It's
[04:25.460 --> 04:30.040]  like the big museum there. Saw this pinball machine said, hey, that's the one I used to play
[04:30.040 --> 04:33.560]  when I was a kid. It's like the only pinball machine I give about or give a shit about. So
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.480]  Gavin bought it for me for my birthday and then put it in the office. Nobody knows how to get it
[04:37.480 --> 04:44.440]  out of the office. So now it lives in the office. And it's become very important to us. Yeah, I
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.500]  realized that I'd known you for 20 years and I don't think I'd ever got you anything for any of
[04:49.500 --> 04:54.680]  those birthdays. You got me 20 years of friendship. Yeah, like the right one. Well, 20 years of
[04:54.680 --> 05:02.200]  friendship and 20 gifted subs from Kelzula Games. Hell yeah. And then and then also Gavin cover
[05:02.200 --> 05:09.300]  your ears for this one. 10 gifted from Jorky Belfus. Oh no, Jorky! Big Jorky Belfus here, baby.
[05:09.800 --> 05:17.180]  We also had five from Beeford64 a little bit earlier. And ElbowDeepDaddy had a very early five. Oh great.
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.980]  So thanks for all those gifted subs. Yeah, we appreciate you guys. This is fun. I've been
[05:20.980 --> 05:26.140]  looking forward to this. But since Andrew revealed it to us earlier today, I've been
[05:26.140 --> 05:31.300]  really excited to watch him play pinball. It was really funny how the whole thing unfolded.
[05:31.300 --> 05:35.400]  Yeah. Is this like a free game on Xbox or it costs money or what?
[05:35.980 --> 05:42.600]  Uh, the game itself is free and then you have to buy the tables. Oh, how much was this?
[05:43.420 --> 05:47.660]  I think this was like $12 and it came with two other tables. It's like a three pack.
[05:47.960 --> 05:53.540]  That's way too much. Oh, it's too much. Whoa! Okay. Queef Wellington, five gifted.
[05:55.320 --> 05:59.020]  Thank you, Queef! This highway's for you, Queef!
[06:02.460 --> 06:07.500]  Goddammit! Have you hit the highway once yet? No! I don't think so. I haven't!
[06:08.040 --> 06:14.480]  Life is a highway. Yeah, if life is a highway, Andrew's dead. Yep. Yep. Life is a highway. I
[06:14.480 --> 06:19.860]  haven't been born yet. Yeah. We don't entirely know the way to score big in this game yet. We're
[06:19.860 --> 06:24.220]  still kind of all learning it, but I feel like we regularly get the multiball going. Come on!
[06:24.880 --> 06:28.400]  Yeah, get the multiball going pretty well. George the third, thanks for the gifted. Yeah,
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.400]  to me, it's riding that highway. I think I did it 42 times or something, when I got that high
[06:34.400 --> 06:41.460]  score. Damn! But also, 42 is one number, but so is 10, like 10 gifted from Grunk Funkle.
[06:41.980 --> 06:48.840]  Thank you, Grunk! Also, Gavin's fixing the multiball so that it doesn't electrocute us
[06:48.840 --> 06:57.360]  anymore. Yeah, that's nice. There you go. Whoa! Blindly into the high voltage area.
[06:57.360 --> 07:05.760]  Yeah, that's how you get electrocuted. Night slash in the chat, 25 gifted. Wow, thank you!
[07:06.220 --> 07:12.100]  Wow, shit. The night slash... The night slash one, is the night slash like a piss at night,
[07:12.200 --> 07:17.160]  or does it mean something different? Watch your back if you're going to the bathroom at night.
[07:17.620 --> 07:24.560]  Yeah, I'm telling y'all about it. Literally watch your back. Yeah. Tune in next week.
[07:25.480 --> 07:30.660]  Two weeks. Two weeks. I don't even know anymore. Two weeks. It is two weeks. We got to record a
[07:30.660 --> 07:34.960]  podcast Monday. I got to do a lot of life living between now and then, because I'm... Life living?
[07:35.060 --> 07:40.040]  No! My tank is empty. I got nothing to talk about. You got to live hard until... Yeah,
[07:40.120 --> 07:46.680]  I got to come up with two days worth of life, otherwise. Hey, Geoff? Yeah? Mark the Frog
[07:46.680 --> 07:52.060]  just gifted a sub. Oh, Mark, you're the best. There's some life. Mark the Frog's thinking
[07:52.060 --> 07:56.580]  about getting his first tattoo. Oh, really? Yeah. We were talking about it yesterday.
[07:57.300 --> 08:02.420]  We have some video stuff that we'll be shooting soon, and I think I'm going to ask my friend
[08:02.420 --> 08:07.380]  Richard if he wants to edit it. He's been doing some editing stuff for 100%E. Yeah, solid work.
[08:07.760 --> 08:11.760]  I texted him and I said, hey man, might have this. Are you interested? And he said, yeah. Also,
[08:11.800 --> 08:16.560]  I just got a tattoo gun, so I might go get a tattoo from Richard also. Oh, nice. What are you
[08:18.700 --> 08:21.680]  doing? Thanks for the 10 gifted subs, Schindler's Fist. We got an Earthshaker.
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.040]  You got Earthshaker. Earthshaker, baby. That was a locked ball, so you got a locked ball now.
[08:26.800 --> 08:31.900]  Lock another one, then you can get multi-ball. Yep. Also, Schindler's Fist with the gifted is
[08:31.900 --> 08:37.440]  so cool. It really is. I love Schindler's Fist so much. It's the fist of generosity, you know?
[08:39.380 --> 08:43.280]  Who in the chat has seen some of our Instagram posts this week?
[08:43.520 --> 08:46.220]  Oh, that's right. I may or may not be excited about a video tomorrow.
[08:46.560 --> 08:53.300]  Yeah, that's going to be crazy. Yeah, the chat seems to have seen it. That's pretty cool.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.060]  Thank you, PC Gamer. Tomorrow on the Regulation Gameplay channel, you guys return to
[09:01.240 --> 09:08.580]  Rainbow Six Vegas 2 to play Terrorist Hunt. Is that right? Yeah, it was, I think,
[09:09.240 --> 09:19.840]  a six-year-old game the first time we played it. It's crazy that we went 12 years between videos
[09:19.840 --> 09:30.320]  with that game. Also, it's Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, and special guest Ray Nervais Jr. who will be
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.660]  playing with you guys. How are you feeling about that? How did it feel to get back in with Ray?
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.680]  Piece of piss? Well, as somebody who's made endless amounts of content with Ray, I slipped
[09:41.680 --> 09:47.420]  right back into our old rhythm, just finishing each other's sentences and all that. It was
[09:47.420 --> 09:54.380]  flawless. It was like we had never performed... I don't know what I'm saying. Highway! Highway!
[09:56.420 --> 10:00.560]  Gavin's right. It was, what did he say? Piece of piss. It was just like we were touching each
[10:00.560 --> 10:07.980]  other's piss or whatever. Just like the old days. Hands on dicks. It was lovely. All hands on dicks.
[10:09.460 --> 10:13.520]  Slipped right back into it immediately like it was yesterday. We enjoyed it so much when we
[10:13.520 --> 10:17.240]  finished, we just hit record again and did a second one. Just went right into another one.
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.460]  Cranium Overlord with the gifted. Regulation Moon Girl with the gifted. Shippy with the gifted.
[10:23.620 --> 10:28.080]  There's so many gifted subs. You guys are awesome. I'm really excited for this Ray video tomorrow.
[10:28.640 --> 10:35.060]  The social posts for it, I'm so happy with. The turning and showing them. That took a lot more
[10:35.060 --> 10:41.100]  work than I think people will understand. Originally, I wanted it just to be the pictures of our faces,
[10:41.340 --> 10:46.960]  like one each day. And then someone had the idea to do the actual turnaround in the game,
[10:47.040 --> 10:52.140]  which was way better because we could put the game music on it and have a little reveal.
[10:52.840 --> 10:56.940]  But I think it got the exact reaction I wanted, where it was like people were kind of like,
[10:56.940 --> 11:04.640]  why are we revealing Andrew's face? That should be the final reveal. You may be saying to yourself
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.000]  as an audience member, a regulation listener, a comment leaver, you might be saying,
[11:08.520 --> 11:12.740]  well, this came out of nowhere, just out of the blue, wasn't expecting it. How did that come
[11:12.740 --> 11:18.560]  together? Not for us, it didn't. We've been planning this, I shit you not, for almost two
[11:18.560 --> 11:25.760]  years. It's been so long. We had set up the recording environment at Rooster Teeth right
[11:25.760 --> 11:32.720]  when the fucking company took a nosedive. And so we had to tear it down, never had the opportunity
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.240]  to film it. And then we had to wait till we had another office. You not only set it up,
[11:37.480 --> 11:42.120]  you guys had gone through and started taking the pictures in the office of your faces.
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.380]  Yeah, you guys had already done the face scan. The old office. Oh dude, and it's Larry,
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.420]  it me Larry in the chat. Larry was the helpful one. Yeah, that's right. Larry's the one that
[11:51.420 --> 11:55.380]  made it all possible. That's right. He helped us figure out all the tech, the old tech.
[11:55.940 --> 12:02.060]  I actually think, because I took my face scan last week in the office or whenever we recorded it.
[12:02.180 --> 12:06.600]  Yeah. But I realized that that console didn't have cloud saves. So when I moved to the desk
[12:06.600 --> 12:12.360]  I was playing on, I think it pulled from my cloud saves, which was the one I did in the old office.
[12:12.680 --> 12:16.980]  Oh really? Yeah. I don't think that was my most recent picture. I think that was the one I did
[12:16.980 --> 12:22.620]  in our little room. That's crazy. Like 18 months ago or whatever. Yeah. That's wild. That's funny.
[12:22.620 --> 12:28.260]  Yeah. That's really crazy. Andrew, how are you feeling about this game? You're still on ball
[12:28.260 --> 12:32.880]  one. You cracked a million. Yeah, I'm feeling like I'm getting it. I'm getting the highways
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.180]  a little bit. I'm picturing myself in a bowling alley while I play. Yeah. And that doesn't help
[12:38.180 --> 12:41.500]  apparently. That's a terrible thing to do. I'm never doing that again. We're out of the bowling
[12:41.500 --> 12:48.640]  alley. I've at least cracked a million on a ball. I'm feeling good about ball two. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,
[12:48.640 --> 12:54.080]  I got one locked in already. So I'm primed for a multi-ball, it sounds like. Okay. Not feeling
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.140]  good about ball two, but ball three, I'm telling you ball three is going to be the magic ball.
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.200]  This is the way this game goes. It sucks. It's so rough. It's a motherfucker. It's so rough.
[13:03.580 --> 13:09.260]  Hey, Mark the Frog, put your earmuffs on real fast. Thank you, Frog Damager for the subscription.
[13:10.060 --> 13:15.920]  Thank you Alpha Kappa for the subscription. Frog Damager. Frog, you can take those off now.
[13:16.420 --> 13:24.980]  No! Andrew, are you feeling earth-shaken right now? I've got a lot of things shaken. My pride,
[13:25.180 --> 13:31.440]  my confidence. Earth, not so much so far. But we're getting there. We're climbing. Each game,
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.500]  I feel like I'm getting a little bit better. I'm almost at two million. Yeah. Where we have
[13:36.500 --> 13:44.680]  the machine in the house, when the earth shaker like shakes, like when it actually kicks,
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.940]  boy, it moves like crazy. And my cousin could not believe, like thought there was something wrong
[13:51.940 --> 13:57.480]  when it started doing it. Like worried that something had gone wrong. The whole house rattles.
[13:57.700 --> 14:01.380]  It's crazy. I've never set the high score on earth shaker. Does it have a knocker inside,
[14:01.500 --> 14:07.100]  do you know? What's a knocker? It's basically when you hit the high score, it has a solenoid that's
[14:07.100 --> 14:11.740]  just aimed in the wood. It just like punches the inside of the machine really loud. Isn't that
[14:11.740 --> 14:16.140]  the same as when you get an extra life and it makes that noise? Yeah, because it does that.
[14:16.440 --> 14:20.080]  This game does that. It definitely does that. It sounds like a big old click. Yeah,
[14:20.680 --> 14:23.820]  it's scary as shit. It scares the shit out of you, yeah. It scares the dicks off you.
[14:24.120 --> 14:28.760]  Comes from the back left somewhere. Santa 1563 with the gifted subs and the Captain Curry.
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.140]  Wow. Thank you. If Larry's still in the chat. Hi, Larry. I hope you're doing well. Hi, Larry.
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.320]  Hi, Laurel. Andrew, you got to ride the rails, man. You got to get up that highway.
[14:41.780 --> 14:46.380]  I got to try to... I had a little run of highway. Oh, oh, that's close.
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.640]  You got to put a little English on it, man. You got to tilt that table. Did you do any table shakes,
[14:53.840 --> 15:00.100]  Eric, while you were playing? Yeah, on my first two lives, yes. On ball three, when I was close
[15:00.100 --> 15:05.400]  to the high score, I was so gentle with it. I can do a little shakes. Yeah, yeah, you just tilted
[15:05.400 --> 15:13.440]  you more. I think you've really got to learn to trust that center post. If it's going straight
[15:13.440 --> 15:35.380]  down the middle, just don't flip until it bounces back up. You know what? I understand. It's like
[15:36.100 --> 15:45.300]  we just got broken by Eric today, Nightmare, and it's a 6.6 million, 6.649 or something like that.
[15:45.600 --> 15:49.880]  I've genuinely been considering going into the weekend to try and spend a day beating that.
[15:50.640 --> 15:54.900]  Have you really? Hey, man, I think it's a really cool idea. If you think you can do it, good luck.
[15:55.160 --> 15:59.160]  Oh, damn. I got to go drop the mail off anyway, and my wife is out of town,
[15:59.240 --> 16:03.780]  so it's not like I have anything else to do. Oh, no! There's just going to be a line for the
[16:03.780 --> 16:13.910]  pinball machine. I think what we've learned is we need another pinball machine. Oh, interesting.
[16:14.330 --> 16:18.510]  An Iron Maiden pinball machine? I think that's such a good idea. We did talk about how we need
[16:18.510 --> 16:35.050]  a pinball machine for everybody's personality. Is there a food one? Oh, there has to be. Yeah,
[16:35.050 --> 16:39.750]  I think I played on a Simpsons one in Galveston. It was the first one I'd ever shown Archie,
[16:39.810 --> 16:44.470]  and he liked it a lot. Oh, that's cool. It was a free play, though, so I got mad.
[16:44.950 --> 16:48.070]  Maybe when I've known Archie for 20 years, I'll get it for him. Okay, sweet!
[16:55.250 --> 17:00.030]  So who is Earthshaker personality-wise? It's clearly me. It's Geoff. Yeah, it's Geoff.
[17:00.250 --> 17:04.430]  Yeah. I mean, not just because of being a literal pinball machine from my childhood,
[17:04.430 --> 17:11.030]  but I feel like I fit the Earthshaker vibe. There you go. A bit of a menace. Cool sunglasses. Loud.
[17:13.670 --> 17:17.470]  It's Miller time, baby. Five gifted sunglasses. Thanks, baby. It is Miller time.
[17:19.190 --> 17:23.550]  Match up. Uh-oh, what you got? Uh-oh, what are you gonna get? You got five
[17:23.550 --> 17:27.110]  miles. Yeah, you match up, baby. Oh, that's pretty sweet, actually. Gave me five miles
[17:27.110 --> 17:33.550]  right there, baby. So does anyone know what the order of this game is? You want to light up the
[17:33.550 --> 17:38.110]  numbers and then do something after that? How do you get the numbers lit? I think you want to hit
[17:38.110 --> 17:45.210]  all of the zone numbers. And then once you do that, I think you're supposed to go into
[17:45.790 --> 17:51.970]  that highway that's like on the right by where it says center ramp advances ball value. That's
[17:51.970 --> 17:56.130]  the Earthshaker ramp. So I think you want to go up there to get the Earthshaker. And then once
[17:56.130 --> 18:02.290]  that's happening, I think you want to go into... there's a... it says get to shelter. And I think
[18:02.290 --> 18:08.130]  that there's a thing to get to shelter, but I don't know where that is yet. When you get up
[18:08.130 --> 18:13.390]  there, that's when you split California and Nevada in half. Oh, is that right? Yeah, your ball goes
[18:13.390 --> 18:19.430]  between them and they break apart. Yeah, it tells you to do that. And then it tells you to get to
[18:19.430 --> 18:24.370]  shelter. It keeps yelling it at you. And then there's a countdown timer to do it. Holiday Hippie
[18:24.370 --> 18:28.350]  says, I know the podcast is audio, but do the boys have each other on video? Can they see each
[18:28.350 --> 18:36.190]  other? No. And in fact, we saw Andrew for the first time in about five or seven years. Come on!
[18:36.650 --> 18:41.230]  On our Instagram. Yeah. And even if there was, I have my eyes closed through the whole podcast.
[18:41.390 --> 18:48.920]  Yeah, I do too. I don't want to know. I love the music in this game. It is insane.
[18:48.920 --> 18:55.520]  No! This is like the most video game music. It just sounds so Nintendo.
[18:58.480 --> 19:03.960]  That's a lot of points. Doing great right here. That's a lot of points, Andrew. Keep that going.
[19:04.080 --> 19:11.400]  Keep railing it. Oh, you did it! Oh my god! Yeah! There you go! Earthshaker! Earthshaker!
[19:15.540 --> 19:17.340]  It's a ball lock. You got a ball lock on that.
[19:18.940 --> 19:22.320]  Andrew, this, I don't want to, I don't want to freak out or anything, but this could be it.
[19:22.620 --> 19:25.880]  Yeah, this could be the run, Andrew. This could be the run. Because you just got zone five.
[19:25.900 --> 19:30.840]  There's no good or bad. It's the best you've looked in a long time.
[19:32.680 --> 19:36.920]  How do we get your one, Geoff, to have numbers fly out of each thing that gets hit?
[19:38.140 --> 19:42.400]  We can have, we can have Nick hold like little numbers and just like throw them up at you if
[19:42.400 --> 19:48.020]  you want. Wait, I got us a little, uh, I got us a leaf blower for the bit barrel. We can just use
[19:48.020 --> 19:54.240]  that. Oh, okay. Perfect. Perfect. Where's the, where's the what? You were at the office, right?
[19:54.320 --> 19:57.900]  Were there a bunch of boxes this week? Yeah, there's like two or three in there for you.
[19:58.100 --> 20:03.180]  Okay, thanks. I mean, feel free to open it. It's all stuff for us, but you know. Nah, I don't care.
[20:07.760 --> 20:14.040]  Panic flips. Watch him just panic. This is so funny. 2.3. Was that your first ball?
[20:14.700 --> 20:19.500]  No, that was ball two, but I get another ball at three million. Yep. And I'm close. I don't think
[20:19.500 --> 20:23.540]  that's the way our machine is set. I think you get a ball at like four million. I think it's like
[20:23.540 --> 20:28.420]  four, four, one, five or something. I think I let extra go and got it one time. Yeah.
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.040]  Uh, come on. It told me that I got a free game because I got the high score,
[20:35.140 --> 20:37.760]  uh, but then I was almost late for the podcast. So yeah,
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.340]  free games don't mean a lot when it doesn't cost you anything.
[20:44.860 --> 20:48.500]  Rough. Oh, that's tough stuff.
[20:51.120 --> 20:56.200]  Oh man. Dude, that's pretty good. You were almost halfway there. Yeah. Yeah. You're basically
[20:56.200 --> 21:00.120]  halfway. I think you've got this. How do you get the jackpot? Basically you were halfway.
[21:01.140 --> 21:05.460]  Jackpots usually happen in multiball and it's like you have to hit a bunch of stuff and then
[21:05.460 --> 21:09.480]  it'll light the jackpot arrow, which I think is the arrow pointing to the right in the middle.
[21:09.480 --> 21:19.280]  I think that's right. That was crazy. That was cool. Yeah. Way to hit it. I don't think I would
[21:19.280 --> 21:25.060]  have got that man. That was nuts. That was a 30 year old Geoff could have done that. I don't know
[21:25.060 --> 21:33.980]  about 50. 40 year old Geoff. It's a 50, 50 shot. Yeah. Geoff, have you thought about what you're
[21:33.980 --> 21:37.740]  going to do with this gigantic box when you don't have the office anymore? Yeah. When,
[21:37.740 --> 21:41.540]  when this company goes out of business? When this company goes out of business,
[21:41.660 --> 21:46.720]  I'm getting off the carousel guys. Don't worry about it. I don't give a shit what happens to
[21:46.720 --> 21:55.920]  this because I'm not going to be around. I'm getting off the carousel. So one of the cool
[21:55.920 --> 22:03.140]  things about these virtual boards is if you click B, they have like altered graphics. Wow. So like
[22:03.140 --> 22:08.540]  there's more animation to it and there's like some additional things. So like they have both,
[22:09.120 --> 22:13.540]  they have like the authentic table look, and then you can have enhanced as well,
[22:13.600 --> 22:17.660]  which doesn't change the game at all. This makes it look nice. Wow. This is neat. That's so cool.
[22:18.080 --> 22:21.920]  It is awesome. I'll, I'll tell you guys, like I told the Achievement Hunters when they came in,
[22:21.960 --> 22:29.200]  but I mean it here. Nobody gets out of regulation alive. Okay. All right. I'll let my wife know.
[22:29.200 --> 22:35.420]  This doesn't stop. There's no after. Got it. Yeah. There is just regulation.
[22:42.580 --> 22:47.180]  Not going to deal with finding another group of assholes to turn a company into.
[22:47.260 --> 22:50.920]  No, I hear that. I hear that. God damn, man. You wouldn't just try,
[22:51.060 --> 22:55.180]  try with me again? Third time's the charm? You'd be a part of it, of course, dipshit.
[22:55.180 --> 22:58.980]  Do you want to start over again? Try it with me again? Isn't it exhausting?
[22:59.860 --> 23:08.460]  Oh, man. 2024 was a real tiring one. Yeah. That was a big year. Yeah, it was.
[23:10.500 --> 23:17.760]  I feel like I'm still recovering. Yeah. There's a mode you can get in. I feel like I'm seeing
[23:17.760 --> 23:22.820]  Andrew hit it for the first time today. There's a mode you can get in on the physical one where
[23:22.820 --> 23:29.900]  nothing you do results in points. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It just the game gets so quiet and like
[23:29.900 --> 23:35.860]  it makes you feel so bad. Yeah. Feels so bad. Yeah. You end up just like hitting posts and
[23:35.860 --> 23:40.200]  like targets between ramps that get you like a hundred points. It's like you're off track
[23:40.200 --> 23:47.180]  and you just can't get back on. I watched it really hard. Go up the highway like six times
[23:47.180 --> 23:51.020]  in a row the other day. Yeah, you have to. That's that's the key to like the whole thing, dude.
[23:52.820 --> 23:58.940]  Hey, guys. Played it. Yeah. That's the key to the city. It's true. And guy like me, I'm a fool for
[23:58.940 --> 24:05.580]  the city. Guy like me likes a key, likes a city. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Interesting. Guy like
[24:05.920 --> 24:13.760]  me likes to foreshadow. Yeah. Something to consider, I suppose. Joe Hormone, thanks for the five gifted
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.560]  subs. Thank you so much. Let's do one more of this and then maybe we explore some of the other
[24:18.560 --> 24:21.620]  people. Yeah, because I kind of want you to end on this one, too, because I think you can come
[24:21.620 --> 24:29.120]  back to it. Maybe like he's getting like the zone. Are there like a bunch of different pinball
[24:29.120 --> 24:34.000]  machines on this thing? Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's so many. I used to play this back in the like
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.880]  Xbox arcade days, I think. Yeah, I feel like we we were trying to get Sheamus in this one.
[24:41.140 --> 24:46.140]  Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. I think they had like a Marvel pinball table in here. Oh, they did. Yeah.
[24:46.680 --> 24:50.240]  I remember playing that. My only complaint with these games is that there's a weird thing where
[24:50.240 --> 24:55.320]  I'll buy access to a table and it will be available in one version of the game, but not all
[24:55.320 --> 25:01.860]  versions. Oh, I know there's one table I have in pinball FX3 that they also have in this one,
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.520]  but I'd have to pay to play it in this one, even though they're identical. Oh, that's crazy.
[25:06.780 --> 25:11.600]  Yeah. So I have like three different pinball FX games just because I have multiple tables.
[25:11.880 --> 25:17.000]  They need to like World of Assassination them all together. Fuck. Yeah, I would have thought your big
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.300]  problem with the game would have been your inability to get the high score. But that makes
[25:21.300 --> 25:25.860]  sense, too. Well, now I'm used to that. That's that's just it's day to day life trying to get
[25:25.860 --> 25:34.700]  high scores. I just I got to say I'm not. Oh, just enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy the rain. Yeah, I'm at the
[25:34.700 --> 25:40.120]  time. Oh, you did it. You split the states. Oh, it's in the enhancement. Oh, they're back together
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.420]  now. Oh, they're going to stay open, though, and they say it goes a different way. I believe so.
[25:44.420 --> 25:52.160]  Oh, that's kind of shit that it didn't stay open. Well, I think you have to in order for it to stay
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.980]  open or whatever. You have to, like, clear everything. I see. I think I think that's
[25:57.980 --> 26:02.680]  what's going on with different tables. OK, yeah, sounds good. All three. That was you can come
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.580]  back here. What's your what's your review of Earthshaker? Oh, it's great. Very good. A lot
[26:08.580 --> 26:14.940]  of fun. Eight out of ten. Mark, more earth, more shaking could be required. Let's go to cinematic
[26:15.820 --> 26:20.380]  classic Jaws. Yeah. Oh, cool. Jaws pinball. Hey, Mark the Frog, I'm gonna need you to get your
[26:20.380 --> 26:25.160]  hands on that key and I'm gonna need you to get that key to us. Mark the Frog is letting people
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.520]  know that at the end of the Gasparilla parade in Tampa, the mayor gives the key to the city to
[26:29.520 --> 26:37.820]  pirates. Oh, that's why. Oh, shouldn't it be Gasparilla? Probably. This is a really small
[26:37.820 --> 26:43.700]  table. Yeah, the angles. So like these more narrative bait, like the ones they create
[26:43.700 --> 26:49.480]  have like campaigns within them and they're typically smaller. They yeah, the opening
[26:49.480 --> 26:58.140]  looks smaller too. Have you guys ever done the Jaws on the lake thing that they do? The Alamo
[26:58.140 --> 27:04.200]  Draft House thing? Yeah. Nah. It's one of the things that I always use to when I'm explaining
[27:04.200 --> 27:08.580]  what the Draft House is. It's one of my immediate examples and people are like, what's that like?
[27:08.580 --> 27:14.420]  And I'm like, I would I would never do that. I have no interest in doing that. Whoa. It seems
[27:14.420 --> 27:19.800]  like the best of all worlds because I've done they used to do like a movie in the park thing
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.140]  where like it's Zilker. They would get one of those big blow ups and show something. Yeah. But
[27:24.140 --> 27:27.760]  it's out in the heat, you know? So it's yeah. You don't really want to do that. But if you're on a
[27:27.760 --> 27:33.840]  lake and you're sitting in a boat or like a little life raft or whatever. Sounds kind of fun. I think
[27:33.840 --> 27:41.500]  I think it's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should go back and let us know. OK, here's more stable than it
[27:41.500 --> 27:46.940]  seems. Why'd that guy jump on there? That's a man in this one. You're trying to kill us. Knock
[27:46.940 --> 27:53.440]  them off. Oh, you got it. You got to hit the pier five times. I see. You got to kill him.
[27:53.620 --> 28:03.280]  Are you? Here's a shark. OK. Oh, wow. Oh. Nice get the ball.
[28:05.500 --> 28:11.260]  I don't think he said that in the movie. Get the ball. Someone hasn't seen the director's cut.
[28:14.920 --> 28:22.820]  Did you ever see the sequels? Yes. Of course. I have not. Oh, we should do a Jaws watch along.
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.140]  Each one is better than the last. Yeah. Yeah. They keep what's so unnecessary,
[28:29.420 --> 28:33.260]  they keep relating the sharks to each other. Yeah. So like by the fourth one,
[28:33.260 --> 28:37.280]  it's like the cousin of the second shark that was the brother of the first.
[28:37.840 --> 28:41.560]  Oh, no. Oh. Oh, wow. A little kickback down there.
[28:43.820 --> 28:49.160]  There you go. Take that, Quinn. Much like much like Alien, it gets better as it goes.
[28:52.220 --> 28:56.880]  Yep. Have we released episode three of Charmed yet? Did that come out? Comes out
[28:56.880 --> 29:02.160]  on Monday. I think it's Monday. And then and then who knows? We might greenlight it for more guys.
[29:02.160 --> 29:10.480]  We might. We might. I'm trying, Quinn. If you haven't watched those, you're missing out on some
[29:10.480 --> 29:18.080]  actual kind of fun. And we've seen the views, so we know you haven't watched. Yeah. Oh, fuck.
[29:20.640 --> 29:28.060]  Oh, bummer. He's making fun of you, dude. Gavin comes up with a great idea in the third episode.
[29:28.060 --> 29:35.120]  Mm hmm. I do. Yeah, it's about chess. Oh, now I'm just getting docked all day.
[29:38.020 --> 29:40.180]  Shows you how much I wasn't thinking about Charmed.
[29:42.340 --> 29:45.100]  Well, there might have been chess in the show. I don't remember what brought us to it.
[29:45.200 --> 29:47.420]  You were an absolute delight that whole series.
[29:49.500 --> 29:55.660]  What else did I do? Oh, here's the ray of sunshine. You were. You were so happy to be
[29:55.660 --> 30:05.400]  there and watching that show with us. I had fun. I had a great time. I was having so much fun.
[30:09.810 --> 30:13.770]  I'm not watching Charmed unless you're paying me. Don't care how good you say it. I don't
[30:13.770 --> 30:19.530]  think we said it was good, do we? Yeah, I'm not sure how the show works. We didn't say Charmed
[30:19.530 --> 30:23.730]  was good. We said we were good. I'll tell you this. You can just listen to it without getting
[30:23.730 --> 30:29.010]  in the show. Yeah, I would say it was definitely the hardest I've ever laughed at a wheelchair.
[30:30.890 --> 30:36.570]  I agree with that. We could pick a mission. Menace, shipwreck, evade,
[30:36.710 --> 30:42.730]  evade, evade, evade. I'm always dodging stuff. I laughed crying at that moment.
[30:42.730 --> 30:43.130]  Yeah.
[30:47.470 --> 30:53.510]  It was really something. Oh, it was good. Hang on. Oh, no. Oh, she's listed.
[30:54.230 --> 31:03.270]  Oh, shit. It's tilting the table. So the physics. Oh, no. Way to the ball.
[31:03.630 --> 31:05.290]  Oh, that's a million dollar shot.
[31:05.290 --> 31:15.970]  Oh, no, you fuck. Who are you yelling at? Gravity? The ocean? Yeah, I think the shark.
[31:17.930 --> 31:19.490]  Sometimes shark do this.
[31:24.180 --> 31:29.200]  You know, if I if I had to pick a regulation surprise of the year so far in 2025,
[31:30.280 --> 31:35.520]  I think for our universe, I think it would be how few people have heard of a chicken burger.
[31:36.680 --> 31:39.140]  Yeah, I was surprised. Yeah, crazy.
[31:40.940 --> 31:44.380]  It's been it surprises me every day when I go to social media. Yeah.
[31:44.920 --> 31:48.300]  Think you did good? Nuts. We still haven't caught the beast.
[31:50.540 --> 31:54.220]  We're going to need. Oh, this is earthquake. I'd feel really good about that. 3.8. Yeah,
[31:54.260 --> 31:59.520]  that's halfway. 3.8. It's halfway, but it's well, back out and we can look at all the boards. Yeah,
[31:59.540 --> 32:04.320]  I want to see. Yeah. Run them all down. Yeah. Run them down. Run them down in the street table.
[32:04.320 --> 32:08.500]  Run them down like Mad Max's wife and kid at the end of the first movie. Run them down wild in the
[32:08.500 --> 32:16.900]  street. Yeah. We'll go all the way to the top. Whoa, there's a lot. A World War Z one. Is it
[32:16.900 --> 32:22.940]  movie based? Here we go. OK, let's see. So we got these are like whatever. Yeah. Play Tomb Raider.
[32:23.400 --> 32:28.760]  Goat Simulator. Princess Bride. Oh, wow. Bunch of ones that they made like original boards.
[32:30.060 --> 32:34.240]  Crypt and the Necromancer. DreamWorks pinball games. Good douche. Oh, look at that. Game
[32:34.240 --> 32:41.780]  Night pinball. What is that? Gearbox pinball. Hasbro pinball. Legendary Films pinball.
[32:42.400 --> 32:49.120]  And then we got a bunch of Marvel. A lot of Marvel. Whoa. Garfield pinball. Oh,
[32:49.240 --> 32:54.820]  cool. Oh, hell yeah. World War Z pinball. Snoopy pinball. Oh, let's do that.
[32:55.620 --> 33:03.460]  South Park. Star Trek. Star Wars. Universal. Williams boards. And I think that's it. Yeah.
[33:03.460 --> 33:07.140]  There's a Snoopy pinball. That's so cool. You've got Champion Pub.
[33:07.980 --> 33:12.260]  Oh, Champion Pub is awesome. My favorite machine. And I know it's Meg's as well. Get it. Play it.
[33:12.320 --> 33:16.400]  Play Champion Pub. Want to play some Champion's Pub? Yeah. So good. You got the jump rope. You
[33:16.400 --> 33:22.820]  got the you got the speed bag. So good. You got punch the guy in the face. Crazy Davey wants to
[33:22.820 --> 33:33.440]  know if there's a Charmed pinball. I bet it's original. You can see it in there. The original
[33:33.440 --> 33:37.320]  one. And then you can do the enhanced one where like the guy moves.
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  You want the enhanced one. You want the guy to move. This game's crazy because those green things
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.860]  on the real one, they're like ramps that just send the ball straight up. And sometimes
[33:49.300 --> 33:53.720]  the guy will flail his hand and literally just punch the ball up into the glass.
[33:53.860 --> 34:00.360]  It's so it's so cool. They have this at pinballs at the arcade. It's really cool back.
[34:00.360 --> 34:05.360]  Yeah, I just I like that they keep this one in the corner next to the pinball tools. Yeah,
[34:05.620 --> 34:12.740]  yeah. Geoff, I remember there was an idea that we wanted to do a long time ago at pinballs,
[34:14.320 --> 34:18.880]  filming some stuff in there where you guys are playing a game and we couldn't because of the
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.840]  company we worked for. But I think I think maybe we can now if that's something we wanted to explore.
[34:25.820 --> 34:30.480]  Fuck, boy, I can't wait to go offline and have you explain what the fuck you're talking about.
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.460]  Here we go. I'm down. I think I'm down. Hey, crucified donkey, you're the real shit,
[34:37.540 --> 34:44.540]  buddy. Thank you so much. Whoa. Thanks for the 10. Was it the night that Gavin and I were playing
[34:44.540 --> 34:48.540]  that game together? We were going to beat it. And then. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Yeah,
[34:48.540 --> 34:55.100]  absolutely. Why weren't we allowed to do it? Because Achievement Hunter tried to do it,
[34:55.200 --> 34:59.020]  and then they're like, yeah, they have to like sign a release. It's like, what are you talking
[34:59.020 --> 35:03.260]  about? It was a thing. Yeah, there's a whole thing. Legal got involved instead of us just
[35:03.260 --> 35:14.360]  shooting like we used to. Yep. Pretty cool, right? Yeah. Like, remember when we went to
[35:14.360 --> 35:21.940]  and we played the claw machine, right? Was that a go pizza pie? I think so. Yeah. Ray was there.
[35:22.000 --> 35:30.920]  We did that. If we'd have tried to do that in 2021, it would have required six meetings.
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.580]  We would have had to change the name three times. We would have. I would have had to personally
[35:37.240 --> 35:43.720]  vouch for the video. Yep. But if I like spend like like company capital to get it,
[35:43.720 --> 35:51.180]  it was. So now we're just going to do it. Yeah, let's get to it. Yeah. Cool. What do you think
[35:51.180 --> 35:54.480]  it would have been like to go to the pinball museum? And then when we get sued, we'll beg
[35:54.480 --> 36:01.100]  those lawyers to help us out. Eat shit. I'll let you go a real cheap shot of after he was already
[36:01.100 --> 36:06.320]  beaten. Oh, got to get a cheap shot in. This is cool, man. Ref wasn't looking. He's beaten one.
[36:09.720 --> 36:15.000]  How many are there? How many fights? Yeah, I think 10.
[36:16.500 --> 36:19.860]  You're trying to become pub champion in the middle of a circle thing.
[36:21.540 --> 36:25.600]  Extra ball is lit. There's also like little mini games on the screen on this one, too.
[36:31.190 --> 36:34.050]  I keep West the rad. It was right of you to subscribe.
[36:36.230 --> 36:37.790]  Are poo and ass taken?
[36:44.210 --> 36:49.950]  Ah, no free game. Let's do another one. Well, I didn't know tattoos are so expensive,
[36:49.970 --> 36:54.250]  says Mark the fraud. Seeing just how many people around me have tattoos that I don't believe
[36:54.650 --> 36:58.590]  have five hundred dollars. That's very funny. Now, I will say that's most tattoo
[36:58.590 --> 37:02.110]  people. Yeah, I don't have it. And the reason they don't have it is because they spend it on
[37:02.110 --> 37:09.150]  tattoos. Yeah, because they spend it on tattoos and not food or rent or bills. Yeah. Are there
[37:09.150 --> 37:14.570]  any? I mean, obviously Snoop. I mean, just so you know, I downloaded this game and downloaded
[37:14.570 --> 37:20.850]  Snoopy pinball and I'm playing it right now. So just FYI, I will say, Mark, in my experience,
[37:20.930 --> 37:28.490]  I've been getting tattooed now for 32 years. And it's one of those things where the more money you
[37:28.490 --> 37:33.570]  spend, the better the tattoo. Ninety nine point nine percent of the time. So if somebody if
[37:33.570 --> 37:36.990]  somebody quotes you a price that's like and you get sticker shock, just go ahead and hire them.
[37:37.250 --> 37:41.970]  I mean, look at their work first, but chances are they're worth it. Yep. If they're not good
[37:41.970 --> 37:45.070]  enough to command the price, they don't they don't command it for very long and they don't
[37:45.070 --> 37:49.110]  stay in business. So just so you know, I flipped the doghouse already and then the ball went in
[37:49.110 --> 37:54.870]  the doghouse and it's a ball lock, I believe. And it's Snoopy started writing his his Great
[37:54.870 --> 37:58.990]  American novel and says it's a dark and stormy night. I'm just letting you I'm letting you know
[37:59.550 --> 38:04.850]  that I already know. Is this one a physical machine or a fake one? No, I think this is a fake
[38:04.850 --> 38:10.070]  one. It's too it's too wide and weird. It's not a real pinball machine. I mean, you can get wide
[38:10.070 --> 38:19.210]  ones. Oh, really? Oh, nice. Got it. Wide body. It was a dark and stormy night. That's Snoopy's
[38:19.690 --> 38:25.110]  when he writes his novel. That's what he that's what he writes to to play devil's advocate. I
[38:25.110 --> 38:29.550]  think I said earlier, there's also a tremendous amount of charm and fun in getting cheap, bad
[38:29.550 --> 38:33.970]  tattoos. Yeah, oh, definitely. I have my friend Richard gave me a stick and poke on my ankle.
[38:34.070 --> 38:39.210]  Like you. Yeah, you just do it like I you know, my wife dared me to get fart hard tattooed on my
[38:39.210 --> 38:47.110]  ankle. A lot of artistry in that. My one tattoo was cheap and he was challenging himself to see
[38:47.110 --> 38:54.290]  if he could do it in the fastest possible. That's insane. Nick, that's crazy. Yeah,
[38:54.370 --> 38:57.430]  I was at the time. I was like, oh, whatever. Sure. You just traced it. I don't care.
[38:57.890 --> 39:05.290]  Did you kill in that hole? Every time I walked in. Oh, blockhead.
[39:08.390 --> 39:12.490]  Whoa. Anyway, my wife hates my tattoo. Yeah, I mean, it's fine.
[39:13.890 --> 39:19.130]  I think I hate every character in Peanuts who isn't Snoopy. Really? Oh, yeah. You say that a lot.
[39:19.530 --> 39:27.710]  I mean it a lot. I like every character in Peanuts probably. Like, like imagine Linus,
[39:27.850 --> 39:34.750]  like get real. But shut up. I have no issue with Linus. The one I have the issue with is Charlie
[39:34.750 --> 39:40.110]  Brown because he's such a... Charlie Brown is the worst. Sad sack. He's just ahead of the curve.
[39:40.110 --> 39:45.650]  You can buy a Charlie Brown shirt at like Knott's Berry Farm. Why would you want to dress
[39:45.650 --> 39:54.070]  like Charlie Brown? That's crazy. Charlie Brown has just figured out life early. That's all.
[39:56.330 --> 40:03.150]  You wouldn't wear that outfit? No. It was a big look in skating in the 90s.
[40:06.410 --> 40:08.370]  What, having a tuft of hair on your forehead?
[40:08.370 --> 40:15.030]  No, not like a dumb Charlie Brown shirt. Shut up. Would you wear it for 80 bucks a day?
[40:16.430 --> 40:23.690]  Yeah. Sure. Yeah, probably for 80. Oh, Batman. Oh, wait. Baseball? Playing baseball with a gang?
[40:25.130 --> 40:29.290]  Strike. Gavin fucked it up immediately. I didn't know what I was doing. If we got you that shirt,
[40:29.390 --> 40:36.030]  Gavin, would you wear it? Yeah, why not? Why wouldn't I? Eric? I'll wear it for less than 80
[40:36.030 --> 40:42.890]  bucks. I'll wear it for 40. There you go. You'll wear it for 40? What about for free if I give you
[40:42.890 --> 40:50.790]  this shirt? Yeah, I'll wear it for free. I'll bet you this is what the shirt costs. What if you had
[40:50.790 --> 40:58.670]  to build a wardrobe for a year, you could only wear clothes that cartoons wear? That'd be crazy.
[40:59.250 --> 41:03.030]  That'd be crazy. You'd have to find like real world equivalents. Like you'd basically have to
[41:03.030 --> 41:08.210]  cosplay everything you did. Dressing like CatDog. Yeah. Andrew cosplays Woody the Pooh every day.
[41:09.970 --> 41:20.290]  And more. If we're lucky. And more. No! I hate that Red Baron. Fuck! Stupid Red Baron. Yeah,
[41:20.350 --> 41:24.530]  we hate the Red Baron. It's like Snoopy's rival. Like, they didn't even like him.
[41:25.210 --> 41:28.690]  I'm gonna have to eat my emergency Red Baron soon because it's been in the freezer for like
[41:28.690 --> 41:31.590]  18 months. Oh, is that right? Yeah.
[41:33.310 --> 41:42.730]  What's the type of pizza? I think it's a Supreme-ish one. Andrew's out of here.
[41:45.250 --> 41:51.750]  See y'all later. Well, I reckon I'll leave my Garfield on this one. I think your record is in
[41:51.750 --> 41:57.230]  no danger for a while. Oh, I wasn't worried. At no point was I worried. I'm still not worried.
[41:57.230 --> 42:05.910]  You will be. Oh yeah. Nick knows. I know. I have yet to play the game in the office.
[42:06.370 --> 42:14.010]  Once I get it. No! It's over. Yeah, it's definitely over. You haven't played it? Not yet.
[42:15.070 --> 42:18.670]  What do you mean? Nick's like the guy who watches like the whole fight go down,
[42:18.790 --> 42:23.230]  the whole bar fight go down. Yeah. For like two minutes and just stand still and everybody just
[42:23.230 --> 42:26.430]  knows when he jumps in he's gonna be a total badass. And he's just waiting for the right
[42:26.430 --> 42:30.470]  moment. It sounds like Nick is the guy who watches the whole fight happen in the bar and
[42:30.470 --> 42:36.450]  then it ends and he goes, I would have done that different. Anyway, let me take another drink.
[42:36.610 --> 42:44.570]  And now I criticize. No, I haven't played it yet because every time I come in someone else
[42:44.570 --> 42:47.570]  is either playing it or we're gonna record something or I need to set something up.
[42:47.690 --> 42:54.630]  No. I think you're intimidated. I agree. Oh, I think you need to get Archie on that table. I
[42:54.630 --> 43:00.290]  think you need to get a milk carton. Nick, if you come in the mix, if he comes to the office and
[43:00.290 --> 43:05.750]  I'm playing it, I'll just get off. Okay. I just assume he can't see the glass. You mean the pinball
[43:05.750 --> 43:15.630]  machine, right? Yeah. Oh no. I'm not excited you get to see Nick. So on this board we have Fallout,
[43:15.630 --> 43:24.510]  Doom, Skyrim, Fallout! Aliens, Pinball. Aliens! Dude, Aliens! Aliens, Aliens! I'm watching the
[43:24.510 --> 43:28.590]  show right now and it's so good. I'm halfway through the second episode. I need to catch up.
[43:29.210 --> 43:32.350]  I think episode three is the best episode so far. Oh, it is! I agree.
[43:35.980 --> 43:38.220]  God, those first two movies are so fucking good.
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.040]  I think you can buy the alien Queen Replica on Prop Store at the moment.
[43:43.860 --> 43:45.620]  Really? That's so funny.
[43:45.800 --> 43:48.340]  I think it's like a different model, but from the same mold.
[43:48.460 --> 43:50.840]  So it's like one for one, one to one scale.
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.880]  I think that's probably also a different price range than us.
[43:56.520 --> 43:59.360]  It also needs special shipping.
[43:59.940 --> 44:02.240]  Yeah. Yeah, I already dealt with special shipping.
[44:02.380 --> 44:02.900]  I'm done with that.
[44:03.140 --> 44:06.180]  Yeah, I've seen what their normal shipping is, and it's like $2,500.
[44:07.380 --> 44:09.880]  Let me see how much the reserve is on
[44:09.880 --> 44:12.580]  on the old prop store.
[44:16.780 --> 44:17.560]  You know what?
[44:19.840 --> 44:21.140]  It's kind of a dark table.
[44:21.420 --> 44:24.220]  Yeah, it only says 15 to 30 grand.
[44:25.080 --> 44:27.860]  Oh, well, that's a lot of material for that price.
[44:30.900 --> 44:34.840]  Did you ever play the old AVP game that was on PC
[44:34.840 --> 44:36.200]  like years and years ago?
[44:36.460 --> 44:37.140]  Which one was that?
[44:37.420 --> 44:39.780]  I can't remember. I have one of them.
[44:40.800 --> 44:43.340]  Is it a first person shooter where you play as all three sides?
[44:43.340 --> 44:45.660]  Yes. And each one is a different.
[44:45.860 --> 44:47.520]  It takes place in the same campaign.
[44:48.300 --> 44:52.180]  So it's like it starts with the xenomorph and you start as a facehugger
[44:52.180 --> 44:54.460]  and work your way up the chain.
[44:54.760 --> 44:58.220]  And then I think it goes to the predator next.
[44:59.200 --> 45:01.160]  And then I think it goes to the Marine.
[45:01.260 --> 45:04.420]  Either way, it's like it continues depending on which group you pick.
[45:05.620 --> 45:09.980]  I said I said only 15 to 30 grand because there are some actual props
[45:09.980 --> 45:13.100]  from Alien Chat that are like 250 grand.
[45:13.340 --> 45:17.720]  Oh, that's why I said only 30 grand.
[45:18.080 --> 45:19.380]  Yeah, we're we're. Yeah.
[45:22.040 --> 45:22.980]  That's a lot of money.
[45:24.480 --> 45:25.740]  Yep. It's a lot of money.
[45:26.060 --> 45:27.000]  But I don't pinball for that.
[45:27.240 --> 45:28.680]  It's a lot of money to spend on a thing.
[45:29.160 --> 45:31.700]  Yeah. Think about all the Iron Maiden pinball we could be playing, guys.
[45:32.660 --> 45:34.040]  What would you even do with it?
[45:35.140 --> 45:36.020]  With that much money?
[45:36.380 --> 45:38.780]  You'd better figure out a way to soak a quarter
[45:38.780 --> 45:40.960]  a million dollars of enjoyment out of having it. Yeah.
[45:45.080 --> 45:47.860]  Guys, we're going to have we're having so much fun right now.
[45:48.080 --> 45:49.940]  You know, Sausage Talk episode four came out today.
[45:50.140 --> 45:54.180]  It's always my favorite time when we release Sausage Talks, because you always
[45:54.180 --> 45:56.920]  get such you get to see people's reaction to everything.
[45:57.100 --> 46:00.340]  You have insights to the dumb shit we say.
[46:00.480 --> 46:01.160]  That part's so cool.
[46:01.260 --> 46:04.020]  And then, yeah, we kick off with Ray's thing tomorrow.
[46:04.340 --> 46:06.460]  A video that's almost two years in the making.
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.000]  And then stuff's happening next week that we can't talk about.
[46:10.040 --> 46:10.760]  That's going to be fun.
[46:10.760 --> 46:13.040]  Yep. Egg! Egg!
[46:13.220 --> 46:14.240]  Good time to be regulating.
[46:14.640 --> 46:15.960]  It is a good time to be regulating.
[46:16.400 --> 46:17.140]  It's a lot of fun.
[46:17.300 --> 46:18.940]  Hey, hey, and it's because of you guys.
[46:19.080 --> 46:19.820]  So thank you very much.
[46:20.320 --> 46:21.260]  Thank you so much.
[46:21.400 --> 46:22.700]  We appreciate you guys. Thank you.
[46:25.710 --> 46:27.690]  Yeah, we don't have a thumbs up our assholes.
[46:27.930 --> 46:28.110]  Otherwise.
[46:28.690 --> 46:29.330]  Yep. Yeah.
[46:29.390 --> 46:30.470]  I don't know what we'd be doing.
[46:30.670 --> 46:31.470]  It would not be good.
[46:31.990 --> 46:33.890]  Smelling our asshole thumbs, probably.
[46:34.570 --> 46:36.230]  Yeah. Can't get it clean.
[46:39.610 --> 46:40.750]  The soap does nothing.
[46:41.290 --> 46:42.790]  Am I ninja grilling tonight?
[46:42.930 --> 46:43.750]  Crazy duck man.
[46:43.910 --> 46:46.450]  I'm being a piece of shit tonight is what I'm doing.
[46:46.530 --> 46:48.110]  My wife is out of town.
[46:48.190 --> 46:49.370]  Yeah, my wife is out of town.
[46:49.490 --> 46:52.350]  I've been home by myself for two days with the dog.
[46:52.630 --> 46:54.030]  I have no groceries.
[46:54.330 --> 46:55.870]  I haven't left the house.
[46:56.410 --> 46:57.350]  Yeah, that's nice.
[46:57.530 --> 46:58.090]  In two days.
[46:58.250 --> 47:00.190]  I don't want to go to the grocery store after this.
[47:00.270 --> 47:01.490]  I'm just going to order a pizza.
[47:01.990 --> 47:03.470]  Oh, are you? From where? Where? Where?
[47:04.190 --> 47:07.570]  Well, you know, I've been on a Jets kick lately.
[47:07.570 --> 47:11.430]  OK, I got burned dog into Jets and we've been eating Jets like mad.
[47:11.530 --> 47:14.050]  And I've had it like maybe five times in a row.
[47:14.170 --> 47:15.590]  So I think I might take a break.
[47:16.130 --> 47:17.510]  Oh, OK.
[47:19.750 --> 47:23.950]  Maybe I like a good palm pizza over on Cesar Chavez.
[47:24.170 --> 47:25.610]  OK, good to order from there.
[47:26.430 --> 47:29.630]  You know, Pint House makes a good just fucking bog standard pizza.
[47:29.910 --> 47:33.590]  I think Pint House is really underrated in the world of Austin pizza.
[47:33.970 --> 47:34.390]  Agreed.
[47:34.590 --> 47:36.710]  They lean too heavily into their beer bullshit.
[47:36.710 --> 47:38.890]  I agree. I totally agree.
[47:39.270 --> 47:41.950]  They don't. And it is really good pizza.
[47:42.210 --> 47:43.550]  Yeah, it's really good.
[47:43.730 --> 47:46.470]  It's like they make a they make it if you look at
[47:46.470 --> 47:50.390]  if you looked in the dictionary and under pizza, that would be the picture.
[47:50.470 --> 47:52.330]  You'd see their pizza. Yeah, it's good.
[47:52.330 --> 47:53.890]  But it's a pain in the dick to eat there.
[47:54.230 --> 47:55.410]  Yeah. Yeah, it sucks.
[47:55.930 --> 47:56.650]  Nobody wants to eat.
[47:57.030 --> 47:58.850]  Nobody wants to eat on fucking benches.
[47:59.230 --> 48:00.890]  Yeah. Yeah. I hate that.
[48:01.190 --> 48:02.790]  You know what? I'm not on a picnic.
[48:03.390 --> 48:06.490]  I'm paying you a lot of money over there that I really recommend.
[48:06.490 --> 48:13.190]  It is Eastside Pies open to location over by Pint House on Burnet.
[48:14.250 --> 48:15.850]  I really recommend it.
[48:16.030 --> 48:20.690]  It is they have a they have like a deep dish pizza now.
[48:20.750 --> 48:23.430]  Like what am I saying?
[48:23.470 --> 48:25.830]  Like via 313 style. Oh, like a Detroit style pizza.
[48:25.890 --> 48:28.510]  Yeah. Yeah. Andrew's holding off.
[48:28.610 --> 48:30.790]  Look at this. Oh, man. I eat. Do I have health?
[48:30.870 --> 48:32.730]  I can't look. I'm scared to look at the top left.
[48:32.970 --> 48:33.630]  You're good. You're good.
[48:33.870 --> 48:34.570]  Five health.
[48:34.570 --> 48:37.190]  I eat so much fucking Detroit style pizza now.
[48:37.310 --> 48:38.790]  Yeah. The Detroit. You're going to make it.
[48:39.050 --> 48:40.710]  Which by the way. Yeah.
[48:41.230 --> 48:42.030]  We don't even.
[48:42.510 --> 48:44.150]  Did I even tell you guys I was in Detroit this week?
[48:44.850 --> 48:46.650]  Oh, were you? No, no, you didn't.
[48:46.830 --> 48:49.290]  I drove to Detroit just for the morning.
[48:49.530 --> 48:52.770]  I met a real estate agent, toured three houses and then went to the airport.
[48:53.390 --> 48:55.430]  Yeah. Geez. Oh, God. Kill them. Kill them.
[48:55.570 --> 48:57.670]  I'm trying. I'm trying. Kill it.
[48:58.550 --> 49:00.430]  Oh, that was close. Oh, you're nailing these aliens.
[49:00.850 --> 49:02.130]  Oh, wow. You're doing great, Andrew.
[49:02.890 --> 49:04.170]  You're nailing. Come on.
[49:04.170 --> 49:06.050]  Be windy. Be windy.
[49:07.370 --> 49:08.670]  Oh, get him in the back.
[49:08.750 --> 49:10.650]  Oh, my God. Shoot. Shoot him.
[49:11.050 --> 49:12.730]  Shoot him. Oh, wow. Great play.
[49:12.990 --> 49:13.730]  Oh, wrong movie.
[49:14.510 --> 49:15.010]  Get him.
[49:15.870 --> 49:17.810]  I feel like you like this a lot better than Earthshaker.
[49:18.590 --> 49:22.350]  No, I like Earthshaker more, but this is a cool concept for this machine.
[49:22.570 --> 49:23.010]  Yeah, it is.
[49:23.150 --> 49:26.770]  Like up until this, I was like, this machine's just OK, but this is a really cool idea.
[49:28.610 --> 49:29.770]  Dude, they're getting close to you.
[49:30.110 --> 49:30.730]  Oh, my God.
[49:31.220 --> 49:31.450]  Damn it.
[49:33.350 --> 49:33.810]  Nice.
[49:35.330 --> 49:36.810]  Wait. Oh, Bishop!
[49:40.370 --> 49:42.270]  Come on. Hit her. Get in there.
[49:42.450 --> 49:44.810]  Damn it. Hit her in the face, you bitch.
[49:45.110 --> 49:45.210]  OK.
[49:47.350 --> 49:48.670]  And nuts drop.
[49:49.150 --> 49:50.150]  Yeah, thank you. No!
[49:50.970 --> 49:51.310]  Nice.
[49:52.890 --> 49:56.430]  I think the most unexpected thing outside of the Ice Age connections
[49:56.430 --> 49:59.590]  in Alien Earth is that it has made me want to rewatch Peter Pan.
[49:59.590 --> 50:04.050]  That was one of my favorite animated movies as a kid, and I haven't watched it since.
[50:04.450 --> 50:08.070]  And that was not an experience I was anticipating watching Alien Earth.
[50:08.250 --> 50:09.230]  I get it. I get it.
[50:09.450 --> 50:09.590]  Yeah.
[50:10.490 --> 50:11.010]  Yeah.
[50:12.490 --> 50:13.570]  Local high score.
[50:14.210 --> 50:14.510]  Ass.
[50:15.990 --> 50:16.730]  Oh, doctor.
[50:16.970 --> 50:19.990]  I definitely don't remember all the characters from Peter Pan
[50:19.990 --> 50:21.930]  that everyone's named after, you know?
[50:22.450 --> 50:23.190]  Who's Tim?
[50:24.450 --> 50:25.110]  Timothy Olyphant.
[50:25.750 --> 50:28.110]  Star of Alien Earth.
[50:28.110 --> 50:29.610]  He's fucking...
[50:29.610 --> 50:32.750]  He has a scene in season... in episode three that's awesome.
[50:33.090 --> 50:36.210]  Just peek him being a fucking intimidating weirdo.
[50:36.210 --> 50:36.830]  That's cool.
[50:37.490 --> 50:38.330]  He's like baseball.
[50:38.790 --> 50:40.450]  He's like one of my favorite actors, man.
[50:40.730 --> 50:42.290]  He's in my yard.
[50:43.470 --> 50:45.310]  Now your baseball belongs to me.
[50:47.510 --> 50:48.070]  Pinball.
[50:48.190 --> 50:50.550]  Speaking of cinematic horror classics.
[50:50.750 --> 50:51.690]  Uh-huh. Pinball.
[50:51.810 --> 50:52.970]  I'm going to go over to Pinball M.
[50:53.190 --> 50:53.970]  It's a horror one?
[50:54.630 --> 50:55.390]  To check out.
[50:55.630 --> 50:57.150]  I think maybe my...
[50:57.150 --> 50:58.250]  Not my favorite.
[50:58.370 --> 51:01.710]  It's in my top five favorite movies of all time.
[51:03.530 --> 51:03.870]  Tables.
[51:04.470 --> 51:05.670]  The Thing Pinball.
[51:06.090 --> 51:06.910]  Oh, wow. Cool.
[51:07.130 --> 51:08.430]  God, that movie rules.
[51:08.650 --> 51:10.830]  Man, Andrew's pinball knowledge is deep.
[51:11.290 --> 51:11.930]  Yep. Pin knowledge.
[51:11.930 --> 51:13.270]  I don't know about any of these games.
[51:13.810 --> 51:15.090]  He's got ball knowledge, baby.
[51:15.230 --> 51:15.890]  He knows ball.
[51:16.370 --> 51:16.970]  Andrew knows ball.
[51:16.970 --> 51:17.590]  Is this a fake one as well?
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.770]  I know ball.
[51:19.970 --> 51:21.070]  It looks kind of fake.
[51:21.150 --> 51:22.810]  Is this fake, Andrew, or is this based on a real one?
[51:22.870 --> 51:24.030]  This is not a real table.
[51:24.250 --> 51:24.890]  Damn, man.
[51:25.510 --> 51:25.670]  Yeah.
[51:26.190 --> 51:28.510]  Do they have X-Men 97 or whatever in this one?
[51:30.170 --> 51:30.570]  Shit.
[51:31.050 --> 51:31.590]  Oh, dear.
[51:32.310 --> 51:32.890]  What is that?
[51:33.210 --> 51:34.890]  What's that X-Men game called, Gavin?
[51:35.330 --> 51:35.950]  Is it just X-Men?
[51:35.970 --> 51:36.270]  The one I've got?
[51:36.630 --> 51:36.850]  Yeah.
[51:37.330 --> 51:38.470]  It's just called Uncanny X-Men.
[51:38.850 --> 51:41.090]  OK. It's such a cool machine.
[51:42.870 --> 51:44.350]  I played it a bunch last weekend.
[51:44.510 --> 51:46.170]  It's got some amazing shots on it.
[51:46.470 --> 51:47.830]  It goes like, boing, boing, boop.
[51:47.950 --> 51:48.870]  Yeah, it's really neat.
[51:50.310 --> 51:52.990]  Do you think you play pinball every day, Gavin?
[51:53.870 --> 51:55.190]  No, I go through phases.
[51:55.190 --> 51:55.890]  Yeah.
[51:56.210 --> 51:57.810]  Every time I get busy, I...
[51:57.810 --> 51:59.110]  Forget about it for a minute.
[51:59.670 --> 52:03.050]  I don't ever forget them because they're giant and they lean out into the frickin' room.
[52:03.170 --> 52:04.270]  And they're really annoying to walk around.
[52:04.510 --> 52:05.590]  But other than that...
[52:05.590 --> 52:06.930]  Nobody trusts anybody now.
[52:07.370 --> 52:09.230]  But yeah, put that aside. I forget about it.
[52:09.710 --> 52:15.810]  If there was a way to like, in like futuristic movies where the cars like stack up on each other when you park them.
[52:15.930 --> 52:19.790]  If you could stack pinballs and like get the one down that you want to play, that'd be sick.
[52:19.970 --> 52:23.550]  I don't know what the hell is in there, but it's weird and it's pissed off.
[52:23.950 --> 52:24.510]  Come on!
[52:24.510 --> 52:27.030]  It's weird and it's pissed off!
[52:28.770 --> 52:31.090]  Oh, you got the tentacles.
[52:34.070 --> 52:37.630]  I love that if you hit the barriers, the flares light up.
[52:37.850 --> 52:38.470]  Like this is...
[52:39.170 --> 52:43.170]  This is one of the few examples of an absolutely perfect film.
[52:43.970 --> 52:44.810]  Yes, I agree.
[52:45.850 --> 52:48.730]  Have you ever seen the original? The black and white one from the 50s?
[52:48.850 --> 52:49.410]  It's really good.
[52:49.910 --> 52:51.590]  It's not as good as this, obviously, but it's really good.
[52:55.380 --> 53:04.280]  I'd forgotten that the when they did the prequel movie that they had originally done it with actual like effects.
[53:04.580 --> 53:08.940]  And then they just did everything in post and overwrote it for some reason here.
[53:10.240 --> 53:12.500]  This is all practical effects. And then we did CGI.
[53:12.960 --> 53:13.900]  Yeah. Why?
[53:14.440 --> 53:17.460]  I don't know. The studio was really big into CGI, I guess.
[53:17.980 --> 53:22.380]  I mean, I feel like they just did that with the alien Romulus movie, didn't they?
[53:22.860 --> 53:23.500]  Yeah, I think so.
[53:24.020 --> 53:26.220]  With the Ashbrook robot.
[53:28.440 --> 53:31.620]  Oh, they did that weird uncanny valley thing.
[53:32.160 --> 53:35.300]  Yeah, they kind of just like deep faked his face.
[53:40.320 --> 53:42.100]  I need to watch the thing prequel.
[53:42.740 --> 53:43.500]  I still never seen it.
[53:43.720 --> 53:44.520]  You know, you don't.
[53:44.840 --> 53:45.580]  I've never seen it either.
[53:45.860 --> 53:46.980]  But I like the universe.
[53:47.800 --> 53:48.280]  I do too.
[53:49.820 --> 53:52.420]  Yeah, it's really your only other opportunity to play in the universe
[53:52.420 --> 53:54.160]  unless you play that PlayStation 2 game.
[53:54.700 --> 53:55.880]  Well, yeah, I have that.
[53:55.980 --> 53:56.740]  They remastered it.
[53:56.800 --> 53:57.360]  We should play that.
[53:57.480 --> 53:57.920]  Oh, we should.
[53:58.100 --> 53:58.260]  Let's do it.
[53:58.440 --> 53:59.400]  I've never played it.
[53:59.920 --> 54:01.240]  It's official canon, right?
[54:02.160 --> 54:02.740]  I believe so.
[54:02.840 --> 54:03.360]  I think so.
[54:03.480 --> 54:06.380]  They also did a comic that takes place after the movie.
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.420]  The comic's ridiculous.
[54:07.940 --> 54:10.180]  It is. So I don't know if it's actually canon or not.
[54:11.440 --> 54:13.680]  Have you ever read the comic of the mosque?
[54:14.920 --> 54:15.320]  No.
[54:15.640 --> 54:16.080]  Dude, no.
[54:16.220 --> 54:17.760]  It's freaking brutal.
[54:18.400 --> 54:18.940]  Is it really?
[54:19.340 --> 54:21.060]  Yeah, it's horrific.
[54:21.620 --> 54:21.900]  Yeah.
[54:22.060 --> 54:22.880]  Holy shit.
[54:22.880 --> 54:24.100]  It's freaking... he's a psychopath.
[54:24.460 --> 54:26.420]  They, uh, they dumbed it down a bit for the movie.
[54:26.760 --> 54:27.500]  Oh, is that right?
[54:27.580 --> 54:28.320]  Oh, yeah.
[54:28.920 --> 54:29.520]  That's cool.
[54:29.520 --> 54:32.140]  The movie definitely has a happier ending for Stanley Ipkiss.
[54:32.480 --> 54:33.660]  Oh, dang.
[54:34.660 --> 54:36.800]  And a lot of other people, to be honest.
[54:37.140 --> 54:37.280]  Yeah.
[54:45.270 --> 54:46.110]  Son of a...
[54:46.770 --> 54:47.750]  I feel that.
[54:49.810 --> 54:53.110]  OK, let's go back to Pinball FX and end with some Earthshakers.
[54:53.310 --> 54:53.510]  Yeah!
[54:54.550 --> 54:56.930]  Is Andrew some kind of pinball warlock?
[54:56.930 --> 54:57.750]  Quite possibly.
[54:58.270 --> 54:59.410]  Uh, no, I think I am.
[54:59.570 --> 55:00.550]  But I mean, that's up to...
[55:00.550 --> 55:01.990]  I think it's definitely Eric.
[55:02.150 --> 55:02.310]  Yeah.
[55:02.450 --> 55:05.050]  Also, I just got a new high score on Snoopy, but it doesn't matter.
[55:05.190 --> 55:05.770]  It doesn't matter.
[55:07.870 --> 55:09.050]  Why did I hit continue?
[55:09.950 --> 55:11.530]  Should have hit new game.
[55:11.610 --> 55:11.870]  Yeah.
[55:12.770 --> 55:13.690]  What's the difference?
[55:15.050 --> 55:16.570]  That he just lost the last one.
[55:16.690 --> 55:17.830]  And so it picked up from where he lost.
[55:18.590 --> 55:20.110]  It's sunny drive time!
[55:20.710 --> 55:22.090]  It's sunny drive time!
[55:22.250 --> 55:22.570]  All right.
[55:23.750 --> 55:24.950]  Yeah, I like this.
[55:24.950 --> 55:29.210]  Do you think Rainbow Six Siege will ever bring back Terrorist Hunt?
[55:29.910 --> 55:30.070]  No.
[55:30.290 --> 55:31.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:31.130 --> 55:32.330]  But we won't want to play it.
[55:33.090 --> 55:33.490]  Yeah.
[55:33.670 --> 55:34.270]  You know what I mean?
[55:34.310 --> 55:35.930]  Like, it'll just be like, what's the point?
[55:36.050 --> 55:37.030]  Like, you're going to take it away again.
[55:38.850 --> 55:39.410]  I'd play it.
[55:39.970 --> 55:42.450]  I think the game has moved so far away from that.
[55:42.770 --> 55:44.370]  I just love that game type.
[55:44.570 --> 55:45.470]  I know, I do too.
[55:45.910 --> 55:49.170]  But like, I don't need the competitive online stuff.
[55:49.570 --> 55:49.750]  Yeah.
[55:49.850 --> 55:50.970]  That's not that good.
[55:51.430 --> 55:53.050]  Unfortunately, that's all that game is.
[55:53.190 --> 55:53.950]  That's all it is, yeah.
[55:54.750 --> 55:59.170]  West the Rat says, speaking of deep fakes, is Rainbow Six a stream or a YouTube video?
[55:59.290 --> 56:00.390]  It's a YouTube video tomorrow.
[56:00.970 --> 56:04.290]  Yeah, YouTube video come out normal time and on the Patreon, obviously.
[56:04.870 --> 56:08.230]  The greatest Patreon on the planet Earth is what I heard somebody say.
[56:08.230 --> 56:09.830]  Is that Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod?
[56:10.070 --> 56:10.730]  Yes, it is.
[56:10.990 --> 56:11.210]  Wow.
[56:15.200 --> 56:18.200]  Isn't that quarantine Rainbow Six game a co-op terrorist hunt thing?
[56:18.340 --> 56:18.740]  Oh, I don't know.
[56:19.220 --> 56:20.080]  I'll look that up.
[56:21.500 --> 56:22.200]  Yeah, look it up.
[56:27.640 --> 56:31.140]  I like that Gavin's one working bollock is chatting away today.
[56:31.440 --> 56:31.660]  No!
[56:31.980 --> 56:32.000]  Oh, good.
[56:32.200 --> 56:32.520]  Cool.
[56:34.780 --> 56:35.600]  Okay, ball three.
[56:35.720 --> 56:36.900]  Here's where you make your money.
[56:37.920 --> 56:40.800]  I don't think March's GoochTat is yet, and he gets this one.
[56:42.900 --> 56:43.220]  Fuck.
[56:48.640 --> 56:49.660]  I'm back in there.
[56:49.880 --> 56:50.600]  One more, one more, buddy.
[56:50.640 --> 56:51.060]  You got this.
[56:51.440 --> 56:51.900]  You got this.
[56:51.900 --> 56:51.920]  You got this.
[56:51.920 --> 56:54.340]  You gotta take us all the way to 5.01, the best time of the week, baby.
[56:54.600 --> 56:55.620]  Thank you, Manta Joe.
[56:59.740 --> 57:02.560]  I feel seven million points coming on.
[57:03.860 --> 57:04.300]  Why?
[57:04.440 --> 57:04.940]  I'm not playing.
[57:10.620 --> 57:12.420]  Geoff, can you get rid of that feeling, please?
[57:12.520 --> 57:13.620]  Can you throw that feeling away?
[57:20.650 --> 57:25.370]  It makes no sense for them to do it, but I would play a completely different game with
[57:25.370 --> 57:27.610]  the characters of Earthquake or Earthshaker.
[57:28.070 --> 57:31.210]  You think there should be like a son of Earthshaker or something?
[57:31.650 --> 57:33.050]  I just want like that.
[57:33.210 --> 57:36.170]  I'm looking at the car and the character model of him in the bottom left.
[57:36.290 --> 57:39.350]  And I'm like, I would play an open world shooter with him.
[57:39.490 --> 57:41.030]  He feels like he could exist.
[57:42.570 --> 57:43.330]  Yeah, why not?
[57:43.430 --> 57:44.130]  Who owns the IP?
[57:44.570 --> 57:46.010]  Can we buy the IP for Earthshaker?
[57:46.350 --> 57:47.310]  Can we look into that?
[57:47.370 --> 57:50.190]  Can we buy the Earthshaker IP and then build this world out?
[57:53.190 --> 57:53.410]  Whoa!
[57:54.790 --> 57:56.130]  It'd be in the Tremors universe.
[57:57.530 --> 57:58.330]  Oh, interesting.
[58:01.830 --> 58:04.450]  I enjoyed that for all of the five seconds I had it.
[58:04.550 --> 58:05.770]  Did you immediately lose the second ball?
[58:06.610 --> 58:06.830]  Yeah.
[58:07.790 --> 58:08.270]  Instantly.
[58:08.550 --> 58:09.530]  It's too much to keep an eye on.
[58:11.130 --> 58:12.410]  Now we can focus again.
[58:12.550 --> 58:13.870]  You got another Earthshaker lock there.
[58:15.890 --> 58:17.350]  Oh, building came down.
[58:18.630 --> 58:19.270]  It's up.
[58:20.130 --> 58:21.150]  Dude, the whole office shakes.
[58:22.290 --> 58:23.050]  So much.
[58:24.030 --> 58:24.830]  It worries me.
[58:25.710 --> 58:29.590]  We should film in the main room when Earthshaker's being...
[58:29.590 --> 58:32.090]  Just to show what it feels like.
[58:32.090 --> 58:32.850]  I think we should do that.
[58:34.550 --> 58:35.850]  You're doing really well, Andrew.
[58:37.130 --> 58:38.050]  Trying to lock in.
[58:38.390 --> 58:39.510]  You're locked in, buddy.
[58:39.650 --> 58:40.010]  A million.
[58:42.950 --> 58:45.430]  That was a quick 40k.
[58:45.830 --> 58:48.370]  I'm telling you, man, you gotta go up the highway. Life is a highway.
[58:49.050 --> 58:51.850]  Regulation Rob asks, any more food or cooking content coming?
[58:52.030 --> 58:55.190]  I feel like we came up with at least one today on the podcast.
[58:55.890 --> 58:58.990]  Okay, but there's no way that's something else.
[58:59.410 --> 59:00.330]  That's crazy.
[59:01.010 --> 59:02.190]  You're a nut, dude.
[59:02.350 --> 59:02.870]  I'm doing it.
[59:02.970 --> 59:03.410]  What do you mean?
[59:18.140 --> 59:18.620]  Earthshaker!
[59:26.020 --> 59:27.180]  Alright, you got this.
[59:27.540 --> 59:28.020]  You're doing it.
[59:30.020 --> 59:31.460]  You got the cheevo!
[59:31.480 --> 59:34.100]  I can't see my paddles because of the achievement!
[59:38.300 --> 59:40.540]  What a ridiculous place to put these messages.
[59:40.720 --> 59:43.380]  No! Stop giving me achievements!
[59:44.180 --> 59:46.660]  You got an achievement for getting an achievement.
[59:50.360 --> 59:51.160]  Incredible.
[59:52.960 --> 59:54.300]  Well, that's some bullshit!
[59:54.740 --> 59:55.020]  No!
[59:55.420 --> 59:57.980]  I agree with former Cardinal. Skill issue.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.060]  Sabotage!
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.360]  Oh, no.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.360]  Sabotage!
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.280]  Okay, well, at least next time I get a multi-ball, that won't happen.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.460]  You got two multi-balls! Achievement!
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.600]  Still, that's got to be a high score for you, right?
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.320]  I don't think it was.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.080]  No, I don't think so.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.640]  One more.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.960]  I can fit one more in.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.520]  Not even 501.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:30.340]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.360]  Not even 501!
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.800]  I was feeling so good about that until the achievements popped up.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.260]  That was crazy.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.380]  What would be a feature of the Regulation Podcast pinball table?
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.760]  Well, it'd be a pencil.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.500]  There'd be a sushi container.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.860]  There'd be a falcon.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.100]  A falcon.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.180]  You'd have to shoot the ball through Ian's nostril.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.480]  Yeah, I think the falcon would be protecting something like a big bonus multi-ball thing.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.380]  And you'd have to hit the falcon enough times.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.420]  I think the falcon's protecting the apple tree from scrumping.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.400]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:05.960]  Yeah.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.840]  You get a lot of power-ups.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.340]  A lot of 16s.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.340]  The VCK kicks some kids over.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.380]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.760]  Andrew's dick would be out.
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.380]  There'd be a puddle of piss over by the McDonald's.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.240]  Oh, we should have a section that's five little circles at the bottom.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.420]  And it's all our names.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.140]  And above it, it says, we is not me.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.220]  And you have to light them all up.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.300]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.340]  Oh, and you've got to take it all the way to 501.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.920]  You've got to 501 it.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.220]  There's a lot of premature 501ing in the chat today.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.760]  It's been known to happen in the chat.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.320]  People getting a little excited, you know what I mean?
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:56.100]  Guys, you've got to calm down until exactly 501.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.600]  You got it right here, Andrew.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.660]  I think there'd be piss-wrapped multiball.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:04.960]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.520]  I love the idea of that, a regulation pinball machine.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.060]  That'd be fun.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:18.040]  Hey, Williams, or whoever owns Williams, or whatever it is at this point, let us know.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.180]  Let's hook up and do this thing.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:22.220]  I want to be in pinball effects.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.400]  Have to survive the guillotine.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.600]  Oh, you've got to get to 70 hot dogs.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.660]  It gives you a bit, quote-unquote, to do.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.160]  You'd have to fight someone in the tuxedo.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:37.900]  Yeah, pretty good.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.700]  Well, Andrew, no high score today.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.000]  That just proves that I'm very good at this game.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.760]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.900]  This has been a great stream.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.000]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:04.780]  Tomorrow, if you're watching this live, we will have a new video where Andrew, Geoff, and Gavin play Rainbow Six with Ray.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.540]  And if you're watching this on Tuesday, go back and watch that, because you can.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.200]  That's incredible.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:11.600]  12 years in the making.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.700]  Garfield pinball, what the heck?
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.780]  Any big thoughts to end on with this, guys?
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.120]  Anything that you want to leave the folks with?
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.340]  I'd just like to say, Gavin, I'm glad you finally apologized to Ray so we can make videos with him again.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.000]  Thank you, Gavin.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.100]  Thanks, Gavin.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.460]  Also, hey, Gavin, I just want to be the first one to say, thanks for the career, man.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.420]  I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.200]  We'll see you next time. Bye!
