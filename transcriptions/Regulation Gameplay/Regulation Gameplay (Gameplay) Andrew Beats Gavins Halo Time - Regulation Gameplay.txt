[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Hello and welcome to Gavin's birthday!
[00:02.620 --> 00:03.540]  Happy birthday Gavin!
[00:03.560 --> 00:05.920]  Happy birthday Gavin!
[00:06.880 --> 00:08.480]  Recording this on his birthday.
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.680]  Unfortunately, he couldn't be here.
[00:10.900 --> 00:11.420]  Wasn't invited.
[00:11.560 --> 00:14.120]  He's away. He also wasn't invited.
[00:15.000 --> 00:17.920]  So we wanted to make a little piece of content just for him.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.020]  A little birthday gift for him.
[00:20.520 --> 00:21.560]  We talked about what we could do.
[00:21.680 --> 00:23.600]  Maybe we could have played some Hitman.
[00:23.920 --> 00:25.340]  We could have done a lot of things.
[00:25.740 --> 00:28.860]  But I like a gift that has some longevity to it.
[00:28.860 --> 00:31.120]  Something that he can enjoy for a while.
[00:31.740 --> 00:34.140]  So what we're going to do is...
[00:34.140 --> 00:36.560]  You may remember in the past...
[00:36.560 --> 00:38.160]  I immediately had to click extras.
[00:38.340 --> 00:39.560]  Because I'm an extras guy.
[00:41.720 --> 00:44.340]  Gavin and I had a race in Halo 2.
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.280]  With campaign timing.
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.400]  And he has had an open window to challenge any of the times.
[00:52.620 --> 00:53.520]  And he has a few of them.
[00:53.780 --> 00:56.640]  But he challenged once and it was the wrong level.
[00:56.880 --> 00:58.840]  And he has not gone back to it.
[00:59.940 --> 01:04.220]  So I figured we could go into the last level of the game.
[01:04.300 --> 01:04.920]  The Great Journey.
[01:05.760 --> 01:06.640]  And beat Gavin's time.
[01:08.140 --> 01:08.300]  What?
[01:08.840 --> 01:11.400]  Why does it say I'm ahead of him?
[01:11.580 --> 01:13.100]  It says Ray is number one.
[01:13.160 --> 01:15.520]  Oh, it's because I'm in the wrong thing.
[01:15.780 --> 01:16.000]  That's why.
[01:16.260 --> 01:17.880]  I'm in campaign scoring.
[01:19.360 --> 01:20.080]  That's pretty funny.
[01:21.100 --> 01:23.180]  Gavin did it wrong and then you did it wrong.
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.680]  Yeah, then I did it wrong.
[01:24.840 --> 01:26.220]  But I just picked the wrong thing.
[01:27.160 --> 01:28.280]  There we go.
[01:28.380 --> 01:29.740]  So I need to try to beat Gavin.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.260]  15.52.
[01:32.740 --> 01:35.500]  Do you think you can beat Ray at 11 minutes?
[01:37.740 --> 01:39.280]  I am going to be honest.
[01:39.620 --> 01:41.440]  I have some regrets about this.
[01:41.620 --> 01:42.120]  Why?
[01:42.500 --> 01:43.900]  Some real regrets.
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.020]  Because I thought Gavin's time was a lot better than that.
[01:48.240 --> 01:50.360]  I was running this a little bit last night.
[01:50.540 --> 01:52.400]  So I beat his time last night.
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.260]  At High Charity.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.200]  And I was thinking about trying to beat all his time.
[01:56.200 --> 01:57.320]  For one.
[01:58.320 --> 01:58.960]  For today.
[01:59.220 --> 02:00.620]  But it was just too much.
[02:01.140 --> 02:04.140]  I was finishing this last night.
[02:04.580 --> 02:07.220]  At like 10 minutes.
[02:07.520 --> 02:07.820]  No way!
[02:08.180 --> 02:08.720]  Wow.
[02:09.160 --> 02:12.360]  I thought his run was at...
[02:12.880 --> 02:13.580]  Wait a sec.
[02:13.900 --> 02:16.600]  This is...
[02:16.600 --> 02:18.480]  This birthday sucks shit.
[02:18.760 --> 02:19.760]  Hey, how about this?
[02:20.180 --> 02:22.820]  Let's all say something nice about Gavin on his birthday.
[02:22.960 --> 02:23.460]  I'll start.
[02:23.460 --> 02:24.160]  Okay.
[02:26.520 --> 02:27.960]  Okay, I got one.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.640]  A lot of people don't know this.
[02:29.780 --> 02:31.640]  Gavin has a little brother and a little sister.
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.860]  Who his family all kind of universally likes more than him.
[02:36.460 --> 02:38.700]  And if it weren't for Gavin.
[02:38.980 --> 02:41.340]  His parents wouldn't have a barometer.
[02:41.820 --> 02:44.720]  Of how to choose who's a better kid.
[02:45.160 --> 02:47.680]  So he fills a very important role.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.680]  At least in his family.
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.860]  As being the one with which you measure the more popular kids by.
[02:52.640 --> 02:52.840]  Oh.
[02:53.320 --> 02:53.440]  Okay.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.160]  So that's something.
[02:54.620 --> 02:55.120]  A barometer.
[02:55.280 --> 02:57.360]  Okay, happy birthday.
[02:57.680 --> 03:00.180]  Gavin, I think you have...
[03:00.180 --> 03:02.680]  I think you keep a fine home.
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.240]  You have a great home.
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.740]  It's filled with hornets and stuff.
[03:08.880 --> 03:10.260]  And his fan though, isn't he?
[03:10.320 --> 03:12.100]  Oh, his cable organization is second to none.
[03:12.100 --> 03:13.520]  Mini cats and wasps.
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.400]  I like his cat.
[03:15.460 --> 03:16.220]  I like his slime.
[03:17.020 --> 03:18.000]  Oh, the slime.
[03:19.180 --> 03:22.060]  One time he had a lot of dust.
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.660]  On his door jam, I remember.
[03:25.940 --> 03:27.940]  And he stopped mid-episode to clean it up.
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.220]  So he's very meticulous.
[03:30.660 --> 03:31.460]  Very clean.
[03:31.880 --> 03:32.180]  Okay.
[03:32.500 --> 03:34.180]  He had a wasp fan, that was cool.
[03:34.620 --> 03:37.400]  Yeah, I don't want to interrupt saying nice things about Gavin.
[03:37.520 --> 03:39.280]  But did we figure out what the fuck is going on here?
[03:39.780 --> 03:40.980]  Yeah, so he has 1552.
[03:41.660 --> 03:42.460]  We're gonna beat his time.
[03:42.820 --> 03:44.100]  1552, that is the goal.
[03:44.780 --> 03:46.840]  Let's lock it in, 1552.
[03:47.200 --> 03:47.520]  Okay.
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.400]  So what was the confusion?
[03:51.480 --> 03:53.420]  So I misread
[03:53.420 --> 03:55.220]  the game last night and thought
[03:55.220 --> 03:57.800]  his time was like 9 minutes, 40 seconds.
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.380]  Oh, okay.
[03:58.520 --> 04:01.160]  The confusion was Andrew was giving
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.140]  Gavin too much credit and now
[04:03.140 --> 04:04.840]  has realized in the moment that
[04:04.840 --> 04:07.300]  beating his time is going to be the stuff
[04:07.300 --> 04:08.640]  of babies, not men.
[04:09.020 --> 04:11.380]  This is gonna be a lot easier than I was anticipating.
[04:11.740 --> 04:13.060]  And he started out
[04:13.060 --> 04:14.620]  you know, this is behind the scenes
[04:14.620 --> 04:17.240]  a little sausage talk for you, but when we all sat down to record
[04:17.240 --> 04:18.380]  today and we asked what we were doing
[04:18.380 --> 04:20.780]  Andrew kind of explained it.
[04:20.920 --> 04:21.580]  What the fuck?
[04:22.500 --> 04:25.140]  He said, don't worry, this won't take
[04:25.140 --> 04:26.040]  very long at all.
[04:26.320 --> 04:29.600]  That was before he knew he had a bad time.
[04:31.960 --> 04:33.260]  I mean, it's a solid
[04:33.260 --> 04:34.540]  time, it's just not
[04:35.100 --> 04:37.240]  what I thought it was. I don't know how I got
[04:37.240 --> 04:39.420]  confused. Maybe we'll see when we get to that position.
[04:40.360 --> 04:41.080]  He's barely above
[04:41.080 --> 04:42.000]  par time for this.
[04:43.240 --> 04:44.040]  I think it's the accent.
[04:44.980 --> 04:47.060]  It's easy to confuse Gavin because of the accent.
[04:47.060 --> 04:49.700]  It throws you off.
[04:49.980 --> 04:51.040]  Nine really sounds like.
[04:51.400 --> 04:51.820]  Fifteen.
[04:53.460 --> 04:55.940]  You put that there, then you go invisible.
[04:57.060 --> 04:57.700]  Oh, it froze.
[04:57.960 --> 05:00.040]  Whenever you go invisible, it has a tendency to do that.
[05:00.420 --> 05:01.560]  I went invisible too early!
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.220]  Oh, fuck.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.820]  This is not looking good for your time, dude.
[05:06.100 --> 05:07.640]  No, we're good, we're good.
[05:08.900 --> 05:09.660]  Fifteen minutes.
[05:13.770 --> 05:15.350]  My favorite thing about Gavin
[05:15.350 --> 05:17.510]  is his nose. Sturdy as an
[05:17.510 --> 05:19.130]  unbreakable nose-haver myself.
[05:19.710 --> 05:20.610]  I respect his.
[05:21.110 --> 05:24.010]  What do you think about his back-to-leg ratio?
[05:28.890 --> 05:30.290]  I feel like he's
[05:30.290 --> 05:31.210]  largely legs.
[05:31.570 --> 05:34.510]  He feels like a leg-heavy kind of guy to me.
[05:34.650 --> 05:35.830]  I don't know that I've ever looked
[05:36.350 --> 05:38.370]  at it with that discerning an eye,
[05:38.490 --> 05:39.470]  but I would assume.
[05:39.950 --> 05:40.690]  What just happened?
[05:41.590 --> 05:42.550]  I died.
[05:43.390 --> 05:44.670]  You have to go all the way out?
[05:45.650 --> 05:47.990]  Yeah, you have to back out
[05:47.990 --> 05:49.470]  because you lose time otherwise.
[05:50.190 --> 05:50.350]  Really?
[05:50.770 --> 05:53.230]  Oh, does it count the respawn or something?
[05:54.090 --> 05:55.650]  I guess there's no checkpoint, so I can just
[05:55.650 --> 05:57.310]  hit restart, but yeah, once you checkpoint
[05:57.310 --> 05:59.790]  for the first time, you have to exit, save, and quit.
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.610]  Right, because this is just the beginning
[06:01.610 --> 06:02.430]  of the level, right?
[06:02.610 --> 06:02.870]  Yeah.
[06:03.790 --> 06:05.970]  We're going 15 minutes.
[06:06.530 --> 06:09.310]  Yeah, we have to try to beat it within 15
[06:09.310 --> 06:10.970]  freezes when I go camo, because
[06:11.510 --> 06:12.370]  this is a great game.
[06:13.810 --> 06:15.550]  Okay, take that. Remember how broken
[06:15.550 --> 06:17.290]  this was at launch? Like, nobody could even
[06:17.290 --> 06:19.390]  play the Master Chief Collection.
[06:19.410 --> 06:20.230]  Is that right? I don't remember.
[06:20.650 --> 06:22.590]  It had issues.
[06:23.250 --> 06:25.230]  It was a rocky first year, so...
[06:25.770 --> 06:26.990]  But it works so well now.
[06:27.910 --> 06:29.370]  Oh yeah, it's great now, but it was
[06:29.370 --> 06:30.850]  broken to the point, Eric, where
[06:30.850 --> 06:33.190]  people realized that in matchmaking
[06:33.190 --> 06:34.510]  games, in multiplayer,
[06:35.050 --> 06:37.030]  that someone on either team would be
[06:37.030 --> 06:39.050]  designated a host, and you could just
[06:39.050 --> 06:40.570]  boot everybody on the other team.
[06:41.570 --> 06:42.890]  There's a custom session.
[06:43.210 --> 06:44.610]  We win again, guys!
[06:47.110 --> 06:48.930]  So we're doing a little loop. This is
[06:49.550 --> 06:51.630]  the first of a few tricks
[06:51.630 --> 06:53.550]  we're gonna have to do. This will despawn
[06:53.550 --> 06:54.770]  all those enemies.
[06:55.290 --> 06:56.530]  Is that a Scarab you went under?
[06:58.150 --> 06:59.030]  Uh... yeah.
[06:59.830 --> 07:01.210]  Do you have to fight in the game?
[07:01.350 --> 07:02.110]  Do you fight that Scarab?
[07:02.610 --> 07:05.590]  Uh, you have to... Johnson, I think,
[07:05.650 --> 07:07.770]  takes it later. What game are we playing right now?
[07:08.030 --> 07:09.310]  We're playing Halo 2.
[07:09.910 --> 07:12.390]  The final level of Halo 2.
[07:12.630 --> 07:13.870]  I love the soundtrack
[07:13.870 --> 07:15.410]  in this game.
[07:15.790 --> 07:17.370]  Oh, it's great. I love Gavin.
[07:18.070 --> 07:18.610]  I love Gavin!
[07:19.570 --> 07:22.110]  Happy birthday. I think he's okay. I got another nice
[07:22.110 --> 07:24.010]  thing I can say about him. I was texting with him earlier
[07:24.010 --> 07:26.070]  today, and that's something I noticed.
[07:26.250 --> 07:27.970]  If you text Gavin a compliment,
[07:28.750 --> 07:30.190]  you know, something nice to him
[07:30.190 --> 07:31.630]  or about him, he'll text you right back.
[07:32.050 --> 07:34.010]  He's real good about responding to compliments
[07:34.010 --> 07:35.510]  and kind words.
[07:36.770 --> 07:38.110]  So that's something nice about him.
[07:38.790 --> 07:40.950]  If you ask him for a favor or something,
[07:41.070 --> 07:42.870]  it might be a couple weeks, but
[07:42.870 --> 07:45.010]  if you say something real nice to him, he'll get back
[07:45.010 --> 07:46.770]  real fast. I'm going to text him right now.
[07:46.850 --> 07:47.350]  I'm going to say,
[07:48.590 --> 07:49.850]  you're a great guy.
[07:50.650 --> 07:51.290]  Yeah, do that.
[07:52.550 --> 07:55.090]  And then we'll see how long it takes for an
[07:55.090 --> 07:56.970]  acknowledgement, because I was texting him earlier as well.
[07:57.110 --> 07:58.810]  This is great. This is good. I said,
[07:58.850 --> 08:00.910]  hey man, happy birthday. You're a great guy. So now he's
[08:00.910 --> 08:03.270]  going to think something's up, and that's more fun to me.
[08:03.270 --> 08:03.830]  Oh, yeah.
[08:06.310 --> 08:06.650]  Geoff,
[08:07.470 --> 08:09.310]  just let him know he's a great guy.
[08:09.450 --> 08:09.890]  That'd be great.
[08:10.910 --> 08:11.310]  Alright.
[08:13.230 --> 08:14.790]  Great guy message away.
[08:15.470 --> 08:17.030]  He told me this morning when we were texting,
[08:17.290 --> 08:18.830]  because I was saying nice stuff, so he texted right back.
[08:19.610 --> 08:21.490]  He told me that he has now known me longer
[08:21.490 --> 08:23.510]  than he hasn't, which I thought was cool.
[08:23.670 --> 08:24.990]  Wow. That's very interesting.
[08:25.630 --> 08:27.890]  Yeah, we've crossed the halfway mark in his life.
[08:27.990 --> 08:28.390]  Wow.
[08:29.790 --> 08:30.870]  How old is he now?
[08:31.690 --> 08:33.010]  He's in his 40s, I think.
[08:33.210 --> 08:35.610]  Yeah, at least. He's getting up there.
[08:35.610 --> 08:37.430]  I'm trying to remember.
[08:37.690 --> 08:39.510]  He's two years older than Gus.
[08:40.290 --> 08:40.730]  What?
[08:41.750 --> 08:43.130]  Yeah, he's two years older than Gus.
[08:43.230 --> 08:45.070]  He's one year younger than Bernie, I believe.
[08:45.210 --> 08:46.950]  No, two years younger than Bernie.
[08:46.950 --> 08:47.850]  Two years younger than Bernie.
[08:48.310 --> 08:51.870]  I was trying to remember where you guys line up,
[08:51.930 --> 08:53.850]  and I just remember it's like...
[08:53.850 --> 08:54.790]  I think he's...
[08:54.790 --> 08:56.630]  Hold on. I was born in 75.
[08:57.110 --> 08:58.410]  I think he's 53.
[08:59.070 --> 09:00.030]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[09:03.450 --> 09:04.570]  See in the bottom right
[09:04.570 --> 09:06.230]  where it says Gavin Free 948?
[09:07.410 --> 09:09.290]  That's what was fucking me up yesterday.
[09:09.370 --> 09:10.230]  Wait, why does it say that?
[09:10.230 --> 09:11.930]  I don't know.
[09:12.190 --> 09:14.770]  Also, why does it say you've been doing this for a minute and a half?
[09:15.110 --> 09:17.570]  What if Gavin has like bookmarked
[09:17.570 --> 09:19.030]  a time, but he hasn't published it yet,
[09:19.090 --> 09:20.430]  but the game doesn't know that,
[09:20.550 --> 09:23.270]  and it's confusing, so it knows he's got a 948
[09:23.270 --> 09:25.050]  and he's just been holding on to it.
[09:25.350 --> 09:27.490]  You think he did this level faster than Ray?
[09:28.990 --> 09:29.350]  No.
[09:29.350 --> 09:31.210]  Maybe he paid Ray to do it.
[09:31.350 --> 09:33.330]  He went over to Ray's house
[09:34.610 --> 09:35.450]  with an Xbox.
[09:36.970 --> 09:38.210]  I don't think he needs
[09:38.210 --> 09:39.630]  to bring an Xbox to Ray's house.
[09:40.290 --> 09:40.610]  What do you mean?
[09:42.190 --> 09:43.710]  What do you mean? You think Ray has one?
[09:44.570 --> 09:45.890]  I think Ray might have an Xbox.
[09:46.130 --> 09:48.710]  I think Ray probably has a house built out of an Xbox.
[09:50.230 --> 09:52.570]  The Xbox I use for this show
[09:52.570 --> 09:55.050]  is one that Ray gave me
[09:55.050 --> 09:55.410]  because he went,
[09:55.490 --> 09:56.530]  Hey man, I know you don't have an Xbox,
[09:56.530 --> 09:59.390]  you just want this one? And I went, Hell yeah, baby.
[09:59.870 --> 10:01.270]  One of the awesome
[10:01.270 --> 10:03.510]  fringe benefits of doing this thing
[10:03.510 --> 10:04.890]  back in the time
[10:04.890 --> 10:07.350]  when video games
[10:07.350 --> 10:08.590]  were just wild and exploding
[10:09.210 --> 10:11.210]  is that they would give away
[10:11.210 --> 10:12.850]  branded Xboxes like candy.
[10:12.970 --> 10:14.210]  Hey, you want a Gears of War Xbox?
[10:14.310 --> 10:15.350]  You want a Taco Bell Xbox?
[10:16.410 --> 10:18.450]  Every family member I have
[10:18.450 --> 10:21.170]  has a special Xbox of some kind
[10:21.170 --> 10:23.430]  that plays the Taco Bell
[10:23.430 --> 10:24.690]  chime or
[10:25.990 --> 10:27.190]  what does whatever.
[10:27.790 --> 10:27.870]  Yeah.
[10:29.530 --> 10:31.830]  Fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck,
[10:31.870 --> 10:32.530]  oh fuck!
[10:33.890 --> 10:35.590]  I don't typically want to date these
[10:35.590 --> 10:37.090]  but since we already know it's Gavin's birthday
[10:37.090 --> 10:38.190]  it's not that big of a deal.
[10:39.210 --> 10:40.410]  One hour ago.
[10:41.530 --> 10:42.970]  I no longer feel hunger.
[10:44.090 --> 10:45.910]  Former competitive eating champion
[10:46.510 --> 10:47.070]  Kobayashi
[10:47.070 --> 10:48.410]  announced his retirement.
[10:49.870 --> 10:50.950]  I no longer feel hunger.
[10:50.950 --> 10:52.490]  Nobody cares about Kobayashi anymore.
[10:52.490 --> 10:53.990]  I no longer feel hunger.
[10:54.470 --> 10:54.910]  Wow.
[10:56.050 --> 10:57.530]  He finally filled up.
[10:57.730 --> 11:00.170]  He hung up his fork and knife.
[11:00.310 --> 11:00.570]  Mouth.
[11:01.970 --> 11:02.730]  He hung up his teeth.
[11:02.830 --> 11:03.950]  What's the other guy?
[11:05.010 --> 11:05.850]  Joey Chestnut.
[11:06.650 --> 11:08.690]  Joey Chestnut beat the hunger out of him.
[11:08.870 --> 11:11.750]  I feel like Joey Chestnut just dominated him.
[11:11.770 --> 11:13.330]  I know he's like a national treasure and shit
[11:13.330 --> 11:15.290]  but I find Joey Chestnut to be so creepy.
[11:15.990 --> 11:16.410]  Oh really?
[11:16.790 --> 11:17.070]  Yeah.
[11:17.070 --> 11:18.990]  This is something I don't know.
[11:19.730 --> 11:20.730]  Just like in interviews and stuff
[11:20.730 --> 11:23.350]  something scares me about him.
[11:23.950 --> 11:25.410]  I'm gonna eat these hot dogs.
[11:26.270 --> 11:26.450]  Yeah.
[11:27.730 --> 11:29.870]  Maybe I'm just overwhelmed
[11:29.870 --> 11:32.030]  by his hot dog power as a hot dog lover
[11:32.030 --> 11:33.450]  myself. What do you think is going on here Andrew?
[11:34.790 --> 11:35.790]  I just can't.
[11:35.970 --> 11:38.090]  So the fastest
[11:38.090 --> 11:39.730]  way to do it is to go
[11:39.730 --> 11:41.910]  straight across but I'm bad
[11:41.910 --> 11:43.850]  at that so instead I take a little detour
[11:44.750 --> 11:45.990]  but I have to get out of the
[11:45.990 --> 11:47.910]  ghost, activate camo and then get back
[11:47.910 --> 11:49.950]  in and the timing of that
[11:49.950 --> 11:50.810]  can be a little tricky.
[11:51.930 --> 11:53.970]  So that's what I'm struggling with at the moment.
[11:55.990 --> 11:57.450]  See cause you gotta go through here.
[11:57.750 --> 11:59.290]  Well if it's hard for you it'd be impossible for me.
[12:00.450 --> 12:01.370]  I think you can do it.
[12:01.370 --> 12:03.290]  You have to try to get through that.
[12:03.470 --> 12:06.150]  You have to be fast through this.
[12:06.750 --> 12:07.510]  The car's in front of us.
[12:07.730 --> 12:09.630]  Yeah I need the ghost.
[12:11.930 --> 12:12.650]  Oh boy.
[12:13.450 --> 12:14.170]  I'm uh
[12:14.170 --> 12:16.530]  I'm really mad at this game for displaying
[12:17.630 --> 12:18.030]  948
[12:18.610 --> 12:20.290]  cause I had it. I had a save
[12:20.290 --> 12:22.290]  last night at the very end that I
[12:22.290 --> 12:23.730]  could consistently do
[12:24.650 --> 12:25.670]  at 10 minutes.
[12:26.070 --> 12:28.250]  Do you have to quit out of the whole game? Is that what's happening?
[12:28.470 --> 12:30.030]  No it's just crashing.
[12:30.410 --> 12:32.570]  Oh. It is crashing when reloading.
[12:32.650 --> 12:33.410]  Yeah that's what's happening.
[12:34.150 --> 12:35.650]  Yeah they fixed the Master Chief collection error.
[12:42.070 --> 12:43.050]  Sure did.
[12:43.170 --> 12:45.390]  It's only crashing after he fails.
[12:45.490 --> 12:47.050]  It doesn't crash mid-fail.
[12:47.350 --> 12:48.170]  That's true.
[12:48.310 --> 12:49.750]  At least it lets him fail.
[12:51.670 --> 12:53.990]  This was so much worse
[12:53.990 --> 12:55.310]  on the previous gen Xbox.
[12:55.790 --> 12:57.510]  Like at least the load time here is like
[12:57.510 --> 12:59.450]  3 seconds maybe. It's pretty quick.
[12:59.530 --> 13:00.090]  It is pretty quick.
[13:00.090 --> 13:02.490]  Compared to like 20 seconds per run.
[13:06.350 --> 13:09.190]  I love the Hunters. I mean, the Elites.
[13:16.250 --> 13:28.630]  No, where's my camo? Where's my camo? Where's my camo?
[13:28.650 --> 13:29.890]  You have to hit the camo button.
[13:29.890 --> 13:31.550]  You gotta hit the camo button.
[13:31.750 --> 13:32.670]  I need the camo.
[13:34.090 --> 13:35.390]  Andrew, what happened to your camo?
[13:35.650 --> 13:36.370]  Why didn't you initiate camo?
[13:36.370 --> 13:39.010]  It was never there, Eric. It was never there.
[13:39.330 --> 13:40.870]  It was supposed to be. It wasn't there.
[13:41.450 --> 13:42.310]  I just want to point out.
[13:42.330 --> 13:45.230]  It's been a few minutes. I haven't heard back from Gavin yet.
[13:46.130 --> 13:47.710]  Yeah, he hasn't replied to me either.
[13:49.710 --> 13:50.950]  Pretty messed up.
[13:55.170 --> 13:55.570]  Well...
[13:57.010 --> 13:58.410]  That's another thing about Gavin.
[13:58.410 --> 13:59.470]  Gavin, you gotta love.
[13:59.830 --> 14:01.450]  His ability to ruin a bit.
[14:06.710 --> 14:06.970]  Really?
[14:07.650 --> 14:09.590]  You really gotta hang out with him until his birthday.
[14:10.210 --> 14:11.350]  Yes, and nobody.
[14:13.730 --> 14:14.610]  Oh, this could be it.
[14:15.230 --> 14:16.070]  Oh, please!
[14:16.870 --> 14:17.970]  Fit, you piece of shit!
[14:18.390 --> 14:20.790]  No! No! Recover! Recover!
[14:21.270 --> 14:21.470]  Fuck!
[14:22.310 --> 14:22.830]  No!
[14:24.710 --> 14:25.230]  No!
[14:25.230 --> 14:25.530]  No!
[14:26.870 --> 14:27.730]  Hey, Andrew.
[14:28.390 --> 14:30.310]  Can you turn down your game knob a hair?
[14:32.010 --> 14:33.150]  Can you turn up
[14:33.150 --> 14:34.510]  your ability two clicks?
[14:35.070 --> 14:35.630]  Yeah, please.
[14:35.910 --> 14:36.830]  What about now?
[14:38.750 --> 14:40.250]  It's okay. It'll be fine.
[14:42.550 --> 14:44.130]  What about now?
[14:44.330 --> 14:45.270]  Perfect. Wow.
[14:46.230 --> 14:48.590]  Can you have that exact same enthusiasm throughout?
[14:49.530 --> 14:49.890]  Yeah!
[14:50.430 --> 14:51.710]  That works really well for us.
[14:51.710 --> 14:53.070]  Can you beat this part?
[14:53.170 --> 14:53.910]  I wanna see the next part.
[14:54.590 --> 14:56.790]  Yeah, I'm trying to get to the next part, Eric.
[14:57.530 --> 15:00.190]  And do it super fast, because we're kind of on a time crunch here.
[15:00.390 --> 15:00.570]  Yeah.
[15:00.810 --> 15:02.590]  No, we're not! We started early.
[15:04.150 --> 15:04.950]  Fuck me!
[15:06.930 --> 15:07.770]  Can you explain
[15:07.770 --> 15:09.710]  the strategy of getting out, activating your camo,
[15:09.750 --> 15:10.390]  and then driving through?
[15:10.930 --> 15:11.490]  He's picking it up.
[15:11.550 --> 15:14.150]  So, if you're invisible, they won't shoot you.
[15:15.750 --> 15:17.770]  There's a turret right around that corner.
[15:17.870 --> 15:18.470]  Oh, I see.
[15:19.530 --> 15:20.870]  So, I need to get out.
[15:20.970 --> 15:22.930]  And I can't activate my camo in the ghost,
[15:23.130 --> 15:24.450]  so I have to get out and do it.
[15:25.310 --> 15:27.330]  Let me try doing the pro version
[15:27.330 --> 15:29.270]  of what you're supposed to do here,
[15:29.330 --> 15:30.250]  as opposed to what I'm doing.
[15:30.610 --> 15:32.030]  What are you doing? The cheese version?
[15:32.670 --> 15:33.390]  Yeah, he's doing the...
[15:33.750 --> 15:36.090]  No, I'm doing the I'm-not-good-enough version.
[15:36.370 --> 15:37.270]  Oh, I got it.
[15:37.650 --> 15:39.090]  But you're not good enough for that.
[15:39.210 --> 15:39.930]  Well, that's the problem.
[15:42.570 --> 15:44.310]  Do you think this is the way Gavin did it?
[15:45.630 --> 15:46.310]  Uh, yes.
[15:46.310 --> 15:48.470]  This is absolutely the way Gavin did it.
[15:50.190 --> 15:52.630]  I didn't realize you could save scum like this
[15:52.630 --> 15:53.610]  until Gavin did it.
[15:54.290 --> 15:56.530]  So, it's a lot easier doing it this way
[15:56.530 --> 15:57.410]  than saving scum.
[15:57.410 --> 15:58.670]  I'll tell you another thing about Gavin.
[15:59.010 --> 16:01.630]  When he cheats, and he does cheat often,
[16:02.070 --> 16:04.010]  he does it real well, and he covers up.
[16:04.250 --> 16:05.450]  So, you don't even know, usually.
[16:05.810 --> 16:06.390]  Oh, okay.
[16:07.050 --> 16:09.010]  Like, he's able to make a lot of stuff look legit.
[16:09.590 --> 16:11.810]  I'll give him credit for that. That's not an easy thing to do.
[16:12.230 --> 16:12.690]  That's great.
[16:12.690 --> 16:15.610]  He's saying, like, maybe that overkill achievement he got?
[16:16.010 --> 16:16.930]  Listen, I don't want to go back
[16:16.930 --> 16:19.170]  and, you know,
[16:19.430 --> 16:20.370]  re-swim in those waters.
[16:20.430 --> 16:21.770]  I'm just saying in general, as
[16:22.570 --> 16:24.690]  someone who's known him for now more than half of his life.
[16:24.830 --> 16:26.470]  No! Come on!
[16:26.970 --> 16:27.170]  Yeah.
[16:28.090 --> 16:29.630]  He's real good at hiding the cheats.
[16:30.030 --> 16:31.170]  He is, it's true.
[16:32.870 --> 16:34.150]  Make it, make it, make it!
[16:34.190 --> 16:34.970]  Oh, you got it!
[16:35.670 --> 16:39.310]  Oh, you were so much further, though!
[16:39.450 --> 16:40.430]  That was it!
[16:41.030 --> 16:41.910]  Legit progress!
[16:43.150 --> 16:45.790]  That was the pro way? The way the big boys do it?
[16:46.490 --> 16:47.390]  No, it wasn't.
[16:48.430 --> 16:50.150]  The ghost was really broken,
[16:50.310 --> 16:51.690]  so I thought it would fit, and it did.
[16:51.770 --> 16:52.550]  We were so close.
[16:53.510 --> 16:55.310]  What would you do differently this time?
[16:56.350 --> 16:58.610]  Not get stuck, I guess.
[16:59.550 --> 17:00.390]  Be better?
[17:00.610 --> 17:01.190]  I don't know.
[17:02.630 --> 17:04.110]  I'm not sure of the specifics.
[17:06.790 --> 17:07.570]  Okay, come on.
[17:07.570 --> 17:08.230]  Alright, well that...
[17:09.150 --> 17:11.630]  No, you piece of shit!
[17:11.990 --> 17:12.750]  You piece of shit!
[17:14.690 --> 17:15.130]  No!
[17:15.790 --> 17:16.690]  God damn it!
[17:16.770 --> 17:17.570]  That's the wrong way.
[17:20.370 --> 17:21.250]  I hate this game.
[17:22.950 --> 17:23.650]  No, it wasn't, Eric.
[17:24.190 --> 17:24.970]  It wasn't right.
[17:26.210 --> 17:27.130]  You know what else isn't right?
[17:28.030 --> 17:29.770]  Gavin not texting me back
[17:29.770 --> 17:31.450]  from saying he's a great guy.
[17:33.410 --> 17:34.510]  Yeah, I haven't gotten anything.
[17:34.550 --> 17:35.310]  Piece of shit.
[17:35.310 --> 17:37.370]  Man, I'm real sorry there, guys.
[17:37.750 --> 17:39.210]  Yeah, what a scumbag.
[17:39.210 --> 17:40.650]  He's let us all down in that moment.
[17:41.130 --> 17:41.290]  Yeah.
[17:42.550 --> 17:44.490]  Geoff, did you ever hear the story about
[17:45.170 --> 17:47.370]  Pax East, the kid who came up
[17:47.370 --> 17:49.230]  to the Mega64 booth thinking
[17:49.230 --> 17:51.090]  it's the Rooster Teeth booth, and then Rocco said
[17:51.090 --> 17:53.470]  that he was Bernie, and then the kid was like
[17:53.470 --> 17:54.950]  If you're Bernie,
[17:55.490 --> 17:57.350]  then you tell Gavin
[17:57.350 --> 17:59.330]  that he didn't earn
[17:59.330 --> 18:01.050]  the achievement in the
[18:01.050 --> 18:02.590]  Minecraft video.
[18:02.590 --> 18:02.810]  No.
[18:03.830 --> 18:05.870]  We repeat that all the time,
[18:06.050 --> 18:08.470]  and so that's the only reason that I think
[18:08.470 --> 18:10.670]  that Gavin cheats to get these things.
[18:11.770 --> 18:12.750]  That kid knew.
[18:12.890 --> 18:14.870]  That kid knew, even way back then.
[18:15.330 --> 18:15.530]  Yep.
[18:16.630 --> 18:17.370]  See? Smart.
[18:18.170 --> 18:19.870]  It's the accent. It confuses people.
[18:20.050 --> 18:22.730]  You're like, I can tell he's cheating, but he sounds so smart.
[18:23.230 --> 18:24.990]  He sounds like he knows what he's doing.
[18:25.730 --> 18:26.910]  Like, the words are dumb,
[18:27.050 --> 18:27.990]  but the way it sounds.
[18:29.190 --> 18:30.490]  I'd like to imagine he bought
[18:30.490 --> 18:32.630]  a Mega 64 DVD, and he's expecting it to be
[18:32.630 --> 18:33.310]  Red vs. Blue.
[18:33.570 --> 18:36.070]  What the fuck is this?
[18:36.230 --> 18:37.930]  We call him the man from Boston,
[18:38.090 --> 18:40.630]  because he was a child
[18:40.630 --> 18:42.630]  that sounded like an adult man.
[18:44.590 --> 18:46.310]  Do you find out now, years later,
[18:46.330 --> 18:47.510]  that was a young Jeremy Dooley?
[18:48.010 --> 18:49.950]  I mean, honestly, it probably was. Who knows?
[18:50.250 --> 18:50.870]  That would be funny.
[18:55.570 --> 18:57.630]  Bought some merch, then kicked the table in half.
[18:57.770 --> 18:58.070]  That's right.
[18:59.250 --> 19:00.190]  How do you guys
[19:00.190 --> 19:01.790]  like having this company so far?
[19:02.830 --> 19:03.690]  I'm for it.
[19:04.710 --> 19:06.090]  It's not this
[19:06.090 --> 19:08.130]  company that has...
[19:08.130 --> 19:10.210]  I think if we started any kind of company,
[19:10.330 --> 19:11.890]  we'd have to be dealing with the stuff that we're
[19:11.890 --> 19:14.430]  dealing with that is the no-fun parts of having a company.
[19:15.450 --> 19:16.330]  Other than
[19:16.330 --> 19:18.050]  the no-fun parts, I love this.
[19:18.050 --> 19:18.410]  Fuck!
[19:19.390 --> 19:21.890]  There's definitely some non-great parts
[19:21.890 --> 19:24.190]  to having a company.
[19:24.530 --> 19:25.730]  Starting a business, right.
[19:25.730 --> 19:27.570]  It's fun because it's
[19:27.570 --> 19:29.570]  unlocking so many un-fun
[19:29.570 --> 19:31.650]  memories from the last time I did this.
[19:32.030 --> 19:33.550]  21 years ago
[19:33.550 --> 19:35.910]  that I just didn't
[19:35.910 --> 19:37.170]  think I'd have to remember again.
[19:37.990 --> 19:38.290]  Yeah.
[19:39.690 --> 19:40.810]  It's been awesome.
[19:41.830 --> 19:43.170]  A lot of
[19:44.230 --> 19:45.770]  remember... Alright, don't fuck this
[19:45.770 --> 19:46.970]  up next time, LLC.
[19:47.750 --> 19:49.430]  Remember not to fuck that part up.
[19:49.990 --> 19:51.810]  Not learning from that mistake, clearly.
[19:53.170 --> 19:54.230]  I can still do it.
[19:54.710 --> 19:55.190]  Unbelievable.
[19:56.010 --> 19:57.050]  You got it.
[19:57.150 --> 19:59.230]  That was a pro-gamer move right there.
[19:59.310 --> 20:00.370]  That was really impressive.
[20:01.610 --> 20:02.650]  You gotta jump out.
[20:02.730 --> 20:05.430]  You got it, buddy.
[20:06.570 --> 20:07.710]  Look at that.
[20:08.270 --> 20:08.950]  What a move.
[20:09.570 --> 20:10.130]  Right on through.
[20:10.250 --> 20:11.930]  He has no camo activated.
[20:12.410 --> 20:15.090]  He can't even see you.
[20:15.230 --> 20:16.990]  You don't even need the camo.
[20:17.010 --> 20:17.930]  Fuck off.
[20:17.930 --> 20:18.190]  You got it.
[20:18.190 --> 20:21.170]  You got it, baby.
[20:21.450 --> 20:23.110]  You're good as gold like Sheetah.
[20:23.410 --> 20:24.610]  On Vanderpump Rules.
[20:24.910 --> 20:27.390]  Didn't even need the camo, dude.
[20:28.230 --> 20:29.290]  Look at that.
[20:30.290 --> 20:31.570]  Now I gotta clear this.
[20:31.650 --> 20:33.310]  This is baby mode at this point, dude.
[20:34.290 --> 20:34.910]  Oh, nice.
[20:36.050 --> 20:36.810]  What's five?
[20:38.690 --> 20:39.250]  Killatrocity.
[20:39.450 --> 20:40.010]  Killtacular.
[20:42.210 --> 20:42.770]  Killsmith.
[20:44.630 --> 20:45.510]  Killswitch engage.
[20:48.010 --> 20:49.130]  Sneak on through.
[20:49.350 --> 20:49.930]  Sneak on through.
[20:50.710 --> 20:51.350]  No!
[20:51.730 --> 20:53.370]  I don't think I've checkpointed.
[20:53.630 --> 20:54.690]  I don't think I've checkpointed.
[20:54.790 --> 20:56.390]  You just did.
[20:57.110 --> 20:57.810]  It's not checkpoint.
[20:58.430 --> 20:59.810]  There it is.
[21:00.270 --> 21:05.950]  Now we gotta snipe this.
[21:08.470 --> 21:09.630]  Go snipe the other thing.
[21:09.970 --> 21:10.350]  Yeah, hurry up.
[21:11.250 --> 21:11.890]  Fuck.
[21:15.100 --> 21:16.520]  Oh, you're trying to get the guys with the...
[21:16.520 --> 21:17.360]  Okay, there we go. The door is open.
[21:17.600 --> 21:18.000]  Uh-oh.
[21:18.120 --> 21:19.420]  What happened?
[21:21.500 --> 21:22.400]  Did you need that?
[21:22.440 --> 21:23.100]  I don't know.
[21:24.060 --> 21:26.040]  Now, did you need that one?
[21:26.500 --> 21:27.580]  Did you need that?
[21:29.020 --> 21:30.660]  Been riding it through here the whole time.
[21:30.760 --> 21:32.000]  Is that good or bad, Andrew?
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.220]  That's not important to the run, is it?
[21:36.300 --> 21:38.000]  You haven't been restarting over and over
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.140]  because that happens, right?
[21:39.960 --> 21:41.640]  I have recently...
[21:41.640 --> 21:43.380]  Y'all know how I feel about jet skis, right?
[21:43.640 --> 21:44.740]  It's been well-established.
[21:44.940 --> 21:46.120]  We've sold jet ski merch.
[21:47.620 --> 21:49.800]  I've recently fallen into jet ski
[21:49.800 --> 21:51.640]  TikTok, which is this
[21:51.640 --> 21:54.040]  kids in college age
[21:54.040 --> 21:55.820]  kids that'll buy a jet ski for $100
[21:55.820 --> 21:57.680]  and then figure out how to fix it for $50
[21:57.680 --> 21:59.280]  and then flip it and sell it.
[21:59.940 --> 22:01.460]  I'm on lawnmower TikTok
[22:01.460 --> 22:02.160]  in the same way.
[22:03.600 --> 22:05.100]  I was just sitting here thinking
[22:05.640 --> 22:08.160]  if we lived in the
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.420]  Halo universe, that's what
[22:09.420 --> 22:11.020]  high schoolers would do with ghosts.
[22:11.720 --> 22:13.260]  They'd be like, I got a ghost for $100
[22:13.260 --> 22:14.760]  and it fucking doesn't run.
[22:15.300 --> 22:17.660]  Plasma coils are all fucking fucked up.
[22:19.280 --> 22:20.240]  You're totally right.
[22:20.720 --> 22:23.540]  I can buy a new decoupler on Etsy
[22:23.540 --> 22:25.560]  for $50 and I should get this thing.
[22:25.660 --> 22:27.440]  I should get this thing back out
[22:27.440 --> 22:27.980]  on the glass.
[22:29.660 --> 22:31.640]  Now, is it a lot of jet ski repairs?
[22:31.960 --> 22:33.680]  It's mostly all jet ski repairs.
[22:33.960 --> 22:35.060]  It's just people going like,
[22:35.140 --> 22:36.940]  I can tell that this is what's wrong with it
[22:36.940 --> 22:38.200]  and there's so much it takes to fix it.
[22:38.580 --> 22:40.740]  It makes jet ski seem incredibly easy to work on.
[22:42.620 --> 22:44.880]  So, if the stuff
[22:44.880 --> 22:47.000]  we do where we talk about inside the business is sausage
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.540]  talk, we're seeing
[22:48.540 --> 22:50.340]  behind the scenes of how Andrew
[22:50.340 --> 22:52.020]  gets better times than Gavin.
[22:52.680 --> 22:53.940]  Should this be sausage gameplay?
[22:55.780 --> 22:57.020]  Yeah, this is sausage
[22:57.020 --> 22:57.460]  play.
[22:59.120 --> 23:00.640]  There's gotta be...
[23:00.640 --> 23:01.320]  Technically,
[23:02.740 --> 23:04.080]  this is sausage play.
[23:04.080 --> 23:06.320]  I mean, you're not allowed to name stuff anymore.
[23:06.680 --> 23:07.880]  I mean, I've pretty much
[23:07.880 --> 23:09.580]  named everything from
[23:10.180 --> 23:10.940]  day one.
[23:12.300 --> 23:13.060]  Sausage play...
[23:13.060 --> 23:15.300]  You understand that's the issue, I hope.
[23:16.080 --> 23:18.200]  Well, yeah, but see, it's a play. I came up with sausage talk too,
[23:18.280 --> 23:19.800]  which is a great name. Everybody loves it.
[23:20.480 --> 23:21.200]  A++, right?
[23:22.200 --> 23:24.040]  So, it's a clear homage to sausage
[23:24.040 --> 23:25.980]  talk while being a clear homage to
[23:25.980 --> 23:28.080]  gameplay, which is what it is. And it has
[23:28.080 --> 23:29.920]  the playful nature. Like, remember Rooster Teeth just
[23:29.920 --> 23:31.100]  playing? Sausage play.
[23:31.100 --> 23:33.160]  Hey, I'd just like to apologize
[23:33.160 --> 23:35.020]  for even bringing it up. Yeah, no.
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.140]  Hey, Nick, apology not
[23:37.140 --> 23:39.100]  accepted. Nick, you're the sausage
[23:39.100 --> 23:41.200]  play master. Oh, I thought you were gonna call me
[23:41.200 --> 23:42.020]  the sausage king.
[23:42.740 --> 23:43.260]  No!
[23:45.440 --> 23:45.960]  No!
[23:53.610 --> 23:54.950]  Is the whole run done?
[23:57.130 --> 23:58.470]  Oh! Yeah!
[24:03.160 --> 24:04.700]  This time on sausage
[24:04.700 --> 24:05.120]  play.
[24:07.720 --> 24:08.880]  I didn't even know that was
[24:08.880 --> 24:09.420]  possible.
[24:11.540 --> 24:12.320]  Crazy stupid stream.
[24:12.320 --> 24:14.700]  We just wanted to give you guys a little peer behind the
[24:14.700 --> 24:15.620]  sausage veil.
[24:22.300 --> 24:24.800]  That thin membrane of intestine
[24:24.800 --> 24:26.740]  that's dried out that they stuff the
[24:26.740 --> 24:27.600]  sausage through.
[24:28.640 --> 24:30.360]  Before you play with it.
[24:34.700 --> 24:35.660]  Oh my god.
[24:36.860 --> 24:38.460]  I did all this yesterday.
[24:40.060 --> 24:40.620]  It was
[24:40.620 --> 24:41.120]  done.
[24:44.880 --> 24:45.680]  Through here.
[24:47.480 --> 24:47.880]  Hey.
[24:50.840 --> 24:52.740]  How are you guys feeling about sausages these days?
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.480]  I'm not a big...
[24:54.480 --> 24:56.560]  I like a sausage patty. I'm not a links
[24:56.560 --> 24:58.160]  guy. I've been doing a lot of
[24:58.800 --> 25:00.380]  chop it up, put it in with some eggs
[25:00.380 --> 25:02.220]  kind of situation. Ooh, I like that.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.200]  I've been eating a lot of sausage
[25:04.200 --> 25:05.720]  links lately. Really?
[25:06.220 --> 25:08.140]  Yeah, like on a tortilla with some
[25:08.140 --> 25:09.500]  barbecue sauce and cheese.
[25:09.780 --> 25:12.140]  Just like on a hot dog bun. I don't know.
[25:12.220 --> 25:14.260]  I've just been feeling real sausage-y lately. Sausage
[25:14.260 --> 25:15.940]  has been a big part of my life lately. I don't know why.
[25:16.180 --> 25:18.320]  It's kind of weird because I was thinking about this the other day.
[25:18.380 --> 25:20.080]  I feel like it's the reverse for
[25:20.080 --> 25:22.060]  barbecue. I'm not interested in
[25:22.060 --> 25:23.680]  barbecue and I haven't been for a while.
[25:23.940 --> 25:25.760]  But for some reason, sausage only.
[25:26.380 --> 25:28.020]  Comes in waves, bud. Yeah.
[25:28.260 --> 25:29.540]  Sausage comes in waves, I guess.
[25:29.540 --> 25:31.780]  Yeah. Or meat comes in waves.
[25:32.100 --> 25:32.380]  Right.
[25:33.560 --> 25:35.620]  You got this right here, Andrew. This is
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.340]  fucking... Wow, you've nailed this.
[25:36.720 --> 25:39.280]  Now you've gotten past this, this is like baby mode shit.
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.260]  This is like so easy. FUCK!
[25:43.640 --> 25:45.440]  Now, technically, that's where you wanted
[25:45.440 --> 25:47.640]  to go. You just should have taken your
[25:47.640 --> 25:48.880]  life and the ghost with you. Yeah, so you should have just
[25:48.880 --> 25:50.720]  keep it rocking and rolling, bud. Yeah.
[25:52.180 --> 25:52.580]  Uhhhhhhh.
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.420]  Ideally, they don't get separated, but...
[25:55.420 --> 25:57.160]  Maybe if you said something nice about Gavin,
[25:57.160 --> 25:58.220]  it would help you.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.200]  I appreciate his
[26:01.200 --> 26:03.280]  vulnerability and sharing how much he likes
[26:03.280 --> 26:05.460]  feet. It takes a
[26:05.460 --> 26:07.040]  brave man to do that.
[26:07.700 --> 26:09.240]  Yeah. Nick, any
[26:09.240 --> 26:09.900]  thoughts on that?
[26:11.900 --> 26:12.460]  Uhhhhhhh.
[26:13.220 --> 26:15.340]  Well, he's probably into the arches
[26:15.340 --> 26:15.660]  a lot.
[26:17.160 --> 26:18.520]  I'll say this in
[26:19.360 --> 26:21.280]  kind of in support of what you
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.340]  said. You've both said now.
[26:24.160 --> 26:25.280]  He, uh...
[26:25.280 --> 26:27.240]  He's got the honesty of a much
[26:27.240 --> 26:28.180]  smarter man.
[26:30.100 --> 26:30.980]  Yup. Yup.
[26:32.380 --> 26:33.300]  Well, you got to
[26:33.300 --> 26:35.240]  fucking spin. Got to do-si-do before you
[26:35.240 --> 26:37.380]  die. A little nose spin, yeah.
[26:37.780 --> 26:38.140]  That...
[26:39.460 --> 26:40.660]  Doesn't make me feel any better.
[26:41.560 --> 26:42.920]  Did you ever skateboard, Nick?
[26:43.100 --> 26:43.980]  No. God, no.
[26:44.880 --> 26:46.720]  Did they ever call you Skateboard Nick?
[26:47.420 --> 26:49.220]  Back in the day? If they did, it was an
[26:49.220 --> 26:49.560]  insult.
[26:50.960 --> 26:53.160]  Because I could not stand on one for more
[26:53.160 --> 26:54.160]  than two seconds.
[26:56.620 --> 26:57.220]  I love
[26:57.220 --> 26:59.480]  the idea of Skateboard Nick being derogatory.
[27:00.840 --> 27:01.240]  Dude,
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.300]  old Skateboard Nick.
[27:03.020 --> 27:03.980]  Am I right?
[27:05.860 --> 27:06.980]  Fucking idiot. Can't
[27:06.980 --> 27:07.740]  ride one.
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.160]  He thinks he's the prom king, but they get up
[27:11.160 --> 27:13.120]  there and then instead of his crown, they hand him a skateboard
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.340]  and everybody laughs at him.
[27:15.020 --> 27:17.060]  And then for some reason, they pour pig's blood
[27:17.060 --> 27:17.840]  on him.
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.160]  He's dropping
[27:21.160 --> 27:22.800]  helmets from the ceiling.
[27:33.220 --> 27:35.580]  It's how the bucket gets knocked over. It's just like
[27:35.580 --> 27:37.220]  Bob Burnquest grinding across.
[27:38.540 --> 27:39.760]  Do you remember in that movie
[27:39.760 --> 27:41.920]  Carrie, when Sissy SpaceX's
[27:41.920 --> 27:43.800]  mom was yelling at her and she called her
[27:43.800 --> 27:44.980]  boobs dirty pillows?
[27:45.660 --> 27:45.840]  Yeah.
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.080]  That always stuck with me.
[27:51.240 --> 27:51.720]  Dirty
[27:51.720 --> 27:53.660]  pillows. It's funny, I hadn't heard that
[27:53.660 --> 27:54.620]  referenced since
[27:54.620 --> 27:55.900]  Spin City.
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.620]  I know of it, but I don't know
[27:59.620 --> 28:01.800]  if I ever watched it. Was Phil Hartman on that?
[28:02.860 --> 28:03.340]  No.
[28:03.620 --> 28:04.260]  Michael J. Fox.
[28:05.940 --> 28:07.360]  You're thinking of
[28:08.600 --> 28:09.380]  news radio.
[28:10.140 --> 28:10.620]  Oh yeah!
[28:11.460 --> 28:13.220]  Was Alan Ruck on Spin City?
[28:13.620 --> 28:13.920]  Yes.
[28:17.060 --> 28:17.700]  He's the one
[28:17.700 --> 28:18.640]  I think who did that line.
[28:20.380 --> 28:21.760]  Spin City does feel like
[28:21.760 --> 28:23.460]  a show Phil Hartman would've been on.
[28:24.820 --> 28:25.880]  In my head, even though
[28:25.880 --> 28:27.600]  he's not there, he fits.
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.820]  You know the guy who made that show
[28:29.820 --> 28:30.720]  is the same guy who
[28:31.740 --> 28:33.480]  also did Scrubs.
[28:34.440 --> 28:34.640]  Yeah.
[28:35.420 --> 28:36.060]  Zach Braff.
[28:37.600 --> 28:38.560]  Yeah, Zach Braff.
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.260]  And Donald Faison, it turns out.
[28:43.040 --> 28:43.960]  Both not pictured
[28:43.960 --> 28:44.600]  on the first show.
[28:45.180 --> 28:47.880]  Now they just do cell phone commercials in their underwear.
[28:47.920 --> 28:48.640]  Yes they do.
[28:48.640 --> 28:50.880]  And boy is it obnoxious.
[28:52.520 --> 28:54.720]  And they got together with all
[28:54.720 --> 28:56.680]  the ad execs
[28:56.680 --> 28:58.480]  at Deutsch or Wieden Kennedy
[28:58.480 --> 29:00.220]  or Richards or wherever the fuck they
[29:00.220 --> 29:02.060]  hire out. And they said,
[29:02.360 --> 29:04.700]  the two of us are on a scale
[29:04.700 --> 29:06.320]  of like 1 to 10.
[29:06.440 --> 29:08.040]  We're a 12 on the annoying scale.
[29:08.220 --> 29:09.960]  But how do we get it to a 15?
[29:10.160 --> 29:12.520]  And the ad exec said, what if we add Aquaman
[29:12.520 --> 29:14.020]  in too? And it would be perfect.
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.380]  What if Jason Momoa
[29:16.380 --> 29:17.400]  came up for no reason?
[29:18.220 --> 29:19.920]  Yeah, that's what he's been up to.
[29:20.280 --> 29:21.140]  That makes sense.
[29:22.720 --> 29:24.380]  And Jason Momoa's like,
[29:24.440 --> 29:26.580]  I'll do anything if you tell me it helps water.
[29:27.680 --> 29:28.420]  Oh my god.
[29:30.140 --> 29:31.300]  Oh shit.
[29:31.740 --> 29:33.080]  Gavin texted back.
[29:36.160 --> 29:37.220]  It's a screenshot.
[29:37.560 --> 29:38.700]  It's just a group text.
[29:39.360 --> 29:42.120]  This is good. Not worrying at all.
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.640]  And it's just our text.
[29:46.960 --> 29:48.160]  Look, each one of these
[29:48.160 --> 29:49.300]  has a different cadence.
[29:50.160 --> 29:51.320]  Was that like 20 minutes?
[29:52.320 --> 29:53.880]  Uh, yeah. Yeah, roughly.
[29:58.780 --> 30:00.080]  Hey, for Gavin, that's like
[30:00.080 --> 30:02.480]  almost instantaneous response.
[30:04.640 --> 30:06.000]  Gavin is like that planet
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.240]  on Interstellar where like a minute in his
[30:08.240 --> 30:10.540]  time is the equivalent of like 16 years
[30:10.540 --> 30:12.360]  on Earth. Remember when he admitted
[30:12.360 --> 30:14.260]  to going 10 years without responding to somebody
[30:14.260 --> 30:15.800]  on Facebook and not realizing it?
[30:16.080 --> 30:17.300]  Oh yeah. Uh huh.
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.860]  It was me.
[30:23.180 --> 30:26.360]  Oh, you got this buddy.
[30:26.460 --> 30:28.380]  That was a cool move you did. Now you're gonna get back on that
[30:28.380 --> 30:29.560]  as soon as it's done freezing.
[30:30.580 --> 30:31.920]  Oh, don't upside down Z.
[30:32.060 --> 30:34.080]  Why are you shooting me? I was visible.
[30:34.260 --> 30:36.220]  It took damage. That's why.
[30:36.460 --> 30:37.220]  Oh my god.
[30:37.800 --> 30:40.220]  I think it didn't appreciate you flipping
[30:40.220 --> 30:41.960]  in front of it. It was like taunting it.
[30:41.960 --> 30:42.400]  Almost.
[30:43.340 --> 30:45.020]  Gavin did this faster than you. That wasn't my choice.
[30:45.140 --> 30:45.520]  It's crazy.
[30:48.850 --> 30:50.070]  Gavin's like good at this then.
[30:51.010 --> 30:52.710]  I don't think that sigh came through
[30:52.710 --> 30:54.590]  for that response, but it was just a
[30:54.590 --> 30:56.050]  long sigh.
[30:58.990 --> 31:01.250]  Should I just thumbs up?
[31:03.970 --> 31:05.010]  How much
[31:06.330 --> 31:07.370]  more level
[31:07.370 --> 31:08.970]  is there after we get to the part
[31:08.970 --> 31:11.130]  where we got... We got, if I
[31:11.130 --> 31:13.070]  would have been able to get on that thing that
[31:13.070 --> 31:15.290]  blew up, we'd be 85% done the level.
[31:15.430 --> 31:16.930]  Wow. At that moment?
[31:17.030 --> 31:18.790]  That was 85%? Yeah. Okay. That was
[31:18.790 --> 31:21.310]  85% done. You'd make great time too.
[31:21.690 --> 31:23.010]  Shame. I think you could beat this
[31:23.010 --> 31:24.670]  faster. This is easy.
[31:25.670 --> 31:27.130]  Uh oh, that fruit
[31:27.130 --> 31:29.070]  followed you. He doesn't like you.
[31:29.430 --> 31:31.070]  This one's not gonna like you either. Andrew,
[31:31.150 --> 31:32.970]  I don't know about this one. None of them like you.
[31:32.970 --> 31:34.230]  I don't think this is the one.
[31:35.450 --> 31:36.270]  There's no jelly.
[31:38.270 --> 31:39.170]  You'll be dead.
[31:40.190 --> 31:41.210]  When's the last time
[31:41.210 --> 31:42.830]  anyone thought about The One?
[31:43.170 --> 31:44.750]  Oh, I think about it all the time.
[31:44.910 --> 31:47.230]  Are you kidding me? Dude, I watched
[31:47.230 --> 31:49.290]  that movie with my mom. We rented
[31:49.290 --> 31:51.270]  it from Blockbuster. Don't know why I watched it
[31:51.270 --> 31:53.310]  with my mom, but watched it
[31:53.830 --> 31:54.590]  with her
[31:55.070 --> 31:56.970]  and it's the first time I saw Jason
[31:56.970 --> 31:58.850]  Statham, I think, and he does a terrible
[31:58.850 --> 32:00.850]  Boston accent and
[32:01.890 --> 32:03.130]  there's a part at the
[32:03.130 --> 32:05.010]  beginning where they attach a bomb
[32:05.010 --> 32:06.350]  to a rat and
[32:06.990 --> 32:07.630]  there's a
[32:08.590 --> 32:10.390]  there's a song that
[32:10.390 --> 32:10.990]  plays
[32:12.370 --> 32:14.290]  it's Lincoln Parker's, it might be Let the
[32:14.290 --> 32:16.370]  Bodies Hit the Floor, I don't remember. It's pretty funny
[32:16.370 --> 32:18.590]  so hang on, I gotta look it up. The rat bomb part's
[32:18.590 --> 32:20.370]  cool because I think you can see his balls. He has like
[32:20.370 --> 32:21.110]  huge rat balls.
[32:22.450 --> 32:24.370]  Dude, my dog has the biggest fucking
[32:24.370 --> 32:25.230]  balls right now. Yeah.
[32:25.910 --> 32:27.010]  Yeah, we gotta get rid of them.
[32:28.670 --> 32:30.410]  Oh, oh, the rat
[32:30.410 --> 32:32.190]  bomb is about to go off and
[32:32.190 --> 32:33.450]  it goes
[32:33.450 --> 32:35.410]  and then it
[32:35.410 --> 32:37.030]  fucking erupts. Oh, that's great.
[32:38.470 --> 32:39.750]  It's cool. The ending of that movie's
[32:39.750 --> 32:41.630]  cool. The whole movie's good. The one rules.
[32:41.770 --> 32:42.650]  I think about the one all the time.
[32:44.270 --> 32:45.450]  It's a style of movie that
[32:45.450 --> 32:47.390]  we don't have anymore. Oh, that's
[32:47.390 --> 32:49.450]  definitely true. I think about the
[32:49.450 --> 32:51.470]  one time right before we started this
[32:51.470 --> 32:53.390]  video when Andrew said, don't worry, this part
[32:53.390 --> 32:55.450]  won't take long and then we're gonna play robot
[32:55.450 --> 32:56.830]  golf. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:57.370 --> 32:59.330]  We'll do moving out. We'll do... oh, okay, cool.
[32:59.450 --> 33:00.010]  Yeah, right on, dude.
[33:02.430 --> 33:02.930]  I
[33:02.930 --> 33:04.170]  did this all yesterday.
[33:04.310 --> 33:05.590]  He's so locked in.
[33:05.830 --> 33:08.130]  He doesn't give a fuck. I did this all
[33:08.130 --> 33:09.830]  yesterday. Hey, I think that
[33:09.830 --> 33:12.270]  in order to give us
[33:12.270 --> 33:13.570]  some stake in this thing, Geoff,
[33:13.970 --> 33:15.030]  we need to...
[33:15.030 --> 33:15.650]  We need to
[33:19.550 --> 33:21.770]  each get assigned a run.
[33:21.990 --> 33:23.590]  This run can be Nick's.
[33:24.050 --> 33:26.010]  Oh, okay. So, like, Nick's
[33:26.010 --> 33:27.150]  really rooting for this one.
[33:27.810 --> 33:29.170]  And the next one can be yours
[33:29.170 --> 33:30.610]  since it was my idea to go last. Why?
[33:30.890 --> 33:33.210]  Can I trade it? No, no, no.
[33:33.210 --> 33:34.670]  This is your run, Nick.
[33:35.070 --> 33:37.070]  This could be it. He's still
[33:37.070 --> 33:38.570]  in it. He's still in it.
[33:39.770 --> 33:41.170]  What the fuck?
[33:41.290 --> 33:43.350]  Oh, my God. You're good, you're good, you're good,
[33:43.410 --> 33:45.070]  you're good. Let me through!
[33:46.190 --> 33:47.350]  Suddenly... Let me
[33:47.910 --> 33:48.310]  through!
[33:49.250 --> 33:50.890]  Alright, Nick, so now you're running.
[33:51.070 --> 33:52.570]  So, Geoff... Alright, my run, my run.
[33:52.870 --> 33:54.370]  Alright, Andrew, we got it right here.
[33:54.370 --> 33:56.090]  I'm gonna buy you a cake.
[33:56.450 --> 33:57.850]  Yep, man, go through.
[33:58.270 --> 34:00.390]  If this is the
[34:00.390 --> 34:02.510]  run, you get a cake of your choice
[34:02.510 --> 34:03.390]  within reason.
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.670]  Cake of my choice within reason.
[34:06.830 --> 34:07.970]  Fulfilled any cakes yet?
[34:09.010 --> 34:10.250]  This'll be the first one.
[34:10.710 --> 34:11.350]  Unless Andrew did.
[34:11.910 --> 34:12.790]  Looking good so far.
[34:13.050 --> 34:16.330]  Looking good, looking good.
[34:16.930 --> 34:17.450]  Bonk.
[34:18.210 --> 34:19.290]  Watch out for the hunter.
[34:19.570 --> 34:21.730]  Oh, that was clean.
[34:21.730 --> 34:23.310]  That was good.
[34:23.530 --> 34:25.510]  Looking good, looking cakeward.
[34:28.290 --> 34:29.930]  Alright, barely took any damage
[34:29.930 --> 34:31.630]  there. Gotta get around these fellas.
[34:31.910 --> 34:33.610]  Oh, that's the best run you've had through there lately.
[34:33.610 --> 34:36.050]  Dude, this might be it.
[34:36.170 --> 34:37.370]  Dude, this might be the...
[34:37.370 --> 34:39.750]  Oh, where'd your cake go?
[34:40.030 --> 34:41.230]  Can I make a recommendation?
[34:41.590 --> 34:43.630]  I feel like when you stop up on the ramp,
[34:43.850 --> 34:45.710]  whatever it is on the other side can see you
[34:45.710 --> 34:47.610]  and is shooting at you, but if you stopped further
[34:47.610 --> 34:49.850]  on the flat behind the rock part, that didn't seem to be happening.
[34:50.990 --> 34:51.390]  Okay.
[34:52.050 --> 34:52.850]  Good note.
[34:53.010 --> 34:55.850]  Thank you for giving him advice on my run, baby.
[34:56.090 --> 34:57.610]  This is the winner right here.
[34:57.870 --> 34:58.950]  Eric's gonna buy you two cakes.
[34:59.350 --> 35:01.030]  Alright, you're locked in, Andrew. You got this thing.
[35:02.650 --> 35:03.990]  So does Andrew get cake no matter what?
[35:04.090 --> 35:05.470]  What the hell is this?!
[35:05.470 --> 35:07.310]  What the fuck?!
[35:13.390 --> 35:15.770]  What the fuck is this?!
[35:15.770 --> 35:16.910]  This is bullshit!
[35:16.910 --> 35:19.170]  How do you like them rat balls?
[35:20.270 --> 35:21.750]  Alright, back to Nick's run.
[35:21.950 --> 35:24.830]  What the fuck?!
[35:24.830 --> 35:27.050]  Alright, Andrew, here we go. River on the flat part.
[35:27.290 --> 35:27.710]  Yeah, I got this, Nick.
[35:31.810 --> 35:33.550]  Way better than last run already.
[35:35.770 --> 35:37.370]  You're making progress.
[35:37.950 --> 35:39.850]  I was like, man, he's taking an interesting route.
[35:40.110 --> 35:43.470]  I think that might be...
[35:43.470 --> 35:44.710]  That might have to be one of the moments
[35:44.710 --> 35:46.310]  that we clip out and put out everywhere.
[35:46.430 --> 35:47.490]  Because that was fucked up.
[35:48.730 --> 35:50.290]  This is your best run yet.
[35:50.470 --> 35:51.190]  Don't fuck it up.
[35:52.010 --> 35:53.730]  Oh, I love it. Right here.
[35:54.110 --> 35:57.130]  Oh, that might be okay.
[35:58.670 --> 36:00.490]  Oh yeah, that may have worked.
[36:01.790 --> 36:04.570]  Wow, that cloaking lasted for two seconds.
[36:08.430 --> 36:09.930]  The music went away.
[36:10.390 --> 36:11.590]  It's so messy.
[36:12.310 --> 36:13.190]  Why is...
[36:14.830 --> 36:17.850]  You gave them plenty of time to change their defenses.
[36:18.250 --> 36:19.950]  Move the little barrier, yeah.
[36:20.890 --> 36:21.770]  They're like, he's coming.
[36:22.890 --> 36:25.530]  Alright, here we go.
[36:25.610 --> 36:26.930]  Here we go, Andrew.
[36:27.290 --> 36:29.930]  This is a cakeless run.
[36:30.570 --> 36:31.490]  We're going cakeless.
[36:31.570 --> 36:32.510]  That's okay, though.
[36:33.490 --> 36:34.690]  We're still gonna do it.
[36:34.810 --> 36:35.730]  I don't think we own that.
[36:36.150 --> 36:37.170]  I don't think we can say that.
[36:37.170 --> 36:37.870]  Oh, right.
[36:39.470 --> 36:40.430]  Let's play!
[36:41.290 --> 36:43.170]  Oh, we definitely don't know that.
[36:44.130 --> 36:44.610]  Gameplay!
[36:46.530 --> 36:48.410]  I don't think anyone can claim that.
[36:48.510 --> 36:49.550]  How about sausage play?
[36:50.230 --> 36:52.430]  I can't wait until we own enough of our vocabulary
[36:52.430 --> 36:54.310]  where we can actually fucking talk about everything.
[36:54.490 --> 36:55.050]  Yeah, we'll see.
[36:56.730 --> 36:58.190]  I'm excited for sausage talk.
[36:59.690 --> 37:01.290]  I'm excited for sausage play.
[37:01.730 --> 37:01.950]  This is Geoff's run.
[37:02.130 --> 37:03.790]  This is my run, yeah.
[37:05.650 --> 37:06.230]  Look at that.
[37:06.270 --> 37:07.590]  He took your advice and everything, dude.
[37:08.030 --> 37:09.830]  Yeah, I think that helps a little bit.
[37:10.550 --> 37:12.570]  That camo does not last very long, bud.
[37:12.770 --> 37:13.590]  Not at all.
[37:14.350 --> 37:15.910]  Just long enough. This is a game of inches.
[37:17.050 --> 37:17.810]  Football and hailing.
[37:18.490 --> 37:19.610]  Oh, look at this!
[37:19.770 --> 37:20.490]  Sometimes golf.
[37:20.510 --> 37:22.090]  Look at this bad boy.
[37:23.670 --> 37:25.710]  Big time bad boy.
[37:25.990 --> 37:26.750]  Oh, and a checkpoint!
[37:27.410 --> 37:29.310]  Wow, you hit this checkpoint last time.
[37:32.390 --> 37:33.430]  laughter
[37:35.050 --> 37:35.570]  laughter
[37:38.310 --> 37:39.350]  laughter
[37:39.350 --> 37:40.510]  laughter
[37:40.510 --> 37:41.310]  laughter
[37:41.310 --> 37:41.410]  laughter
[37:41.410 --> 37:41.850]  laughter
[37:42.910 --> 37:46.230]  Oh, shit. That was incredible.
[37:46.490 --> 37:47.450]  We checkpointed.
[37:48.090 --> 37:49.130]  Wow.
[37:50.810 --> 37:51.910]  Oh, man.
[37:52.410 --> 37:53.790]  I got blasted.
[37:55.030 --> 37:55.550]  Okay.
[37:55.550 --> 37:55.730]  Okay.
[37:58.370 --> 37:59.090]  Oh, man.
[37:59.530 --> 38:00.330]  Okay, through here.
[38:01.390 --> 38:02.610]  Alright, I got this one. This one's mine.
[38:03.150 --> 38:05.390]  Boom. Easy. One and done.
[38:05.790 --> 38:06.930]  Hit that grenade. Let's go.
[38:07.450 --> 38:08.510]  Hit the green on the left.
[38:08.850 --> 38:10.270]  Easy as baby mode, dude.
[38:11.410 --> 38:12.450]  Throw those grenades.
[38:12.730 --> 38:13.850]  I don't like that he's in the back.
[38:14.670 --> 38:15.930]  You missed all those.
[38:16.050 --> 38:17.370]  Just show him who's business.
[38:19.550 --> 38:20.470]  You can't go that way.
[38:20.610 --> 38:21.310]  You have to go the other way.
[38:21.310 --> 38:22.550]  There you go. You go that way.
[38:25.170 --> 38:26.670]  God, I hate the bugs.
[38:27.150 --> 38:28.250]  Yeah, they'll never see you again.
[38:28.370 --> 38:29.590]  Oh, my God. Let me around.
[38:30.250 --> 38:32.170]  Okay, well, there goes my run.
[38:32.610 --> 38:33.370]  Alright, me again!
[38:34.830 --> 38:38.110]  That's what it looks like when Dave gets hit in gears, Andrew.
[38:38.990 --> 38:39.230]  laughter
[38:40.390 --> 38:43.130]  You get shot once, and then Dave freezes,
[38:43.270 --> 38:44.650]  and then just slowly catches on fire.
[38:45.310 --> 38:45.630]  Ah!
[38:47.850 --> 38:49.170]  Reminded me of Private Miller.
[38:50.110 --> 38:50.570]  Aww.
[38:51.410 --> 38:52.710]  We just gotta make that video.
[38:53.590 --> 38:54.930]  All the Millers in video games.
[38:55.310 --> 38:56.170]  That's such a good idea.
[38:58.950 --> 38:59.810]  How are y'all?
[39:00.890 --> 39:02.330]  How did that kill no one?
[39:03.490 --> 39:05.150]  How did that kill no one?
[39:05.690 --> 39:07.010]  Well, my run sucked.
[39:07.750 --> 39:08.890]  Alright, we're back on Geoff's run.
[39:08.970 --> 39:11.050]  Back on Geoff's run. Syncing up with Geoff's previous run.
[39:11.210 --> 39:12.350]  I like Geoff runs.
[39:12.350 --> 39:15.510]  We're gonna carry the success from the previous checkpoint
[39:15.510 --> 39:16.810]  into this checkpoint.
[39:16.810 --> 39:18.950]  We're gonna bip that dude at the top,
[39:19.010 --> 39:21.370]  then we're gonna have an awesome grenade throw to the right,
[39:21.450 --> 39:23.010]  then an awesome grenade throw to the left,
[39:23.050 --> 39:25.450]  and then it's just easy-peasy clean-up mode all the way to the end.
[39:26.110 --> 39:26.490]  Pew-pew.
[39:28.790 --> 39:29.150]  Well.
[39:29.970 --> 39:31.030]  Alright, back on Eric's run.
[39:35.130 --> 39:35.490]  Goddamn.
[39:35.630 --> 39:37.910]  I think that might be the shortest run we've ever had.
[39:38.830 --> 39:40.610]  That was even shorter than the intentionally
[39:41.630 --> 39:42.170]  ended run.
[39:44.050 --> 39:44.990]  I feel like
[39:44.990 --> 39:46.830]  I didn't do any of the stuff I said.
[39:47.970 --> 39:48.450]  It's true.
[39:48.450 --> 39:49.570]  I mean, I tried. I started.
[39:50.930 --> 39:52.090]  You got it. Here we go.
[39:52.470 --> 39:54.330]  Grenade him. Easy. Grenade him. Easy.
[39:57.370 --> 39:58.410]  They're really, like, dodging a lot here.
[39:58.410 --> 40:00.690]  Wow, they are not getting touched by those, dude.
[40:01.770 --> 40:02.970]  They're little bad boys.
[40:04.550 --> 40:06.870]  They are. They are. These are little bad boys.
[40:10.330 --> 40:10.770]  GASP
[40:11.450 --> 40:11.890]  UGH
[40:15.130 --> 40:15.570]  UGH
[40:15.570 --> 40:17.850]  I feel like it's the music.
[40:18.250 --> 40:20.510]  The music stopped and it makes me... I don't know.
[40:20.650 --> 40:21.370]  I don't trust it.
[40:21.950 --> 40:23.750]  I feel like that's changed the entire thing.
[40:23.910 --> 40:27.150]  Who picked up bad boys in the movie draft?
[40:28.970 --> 40:30.610]  Oh, I don't know. I can look real quick.
[40:30.930 --> 40:32.210]  It wasn't any of y'all then, right?
[40:32.430 --> 40:33.010]  Probably Gavin.
[40:34.230 --> 40:35.110]  Probably Gavin.
[40:35.950 --> 40:37.170]  Where the fuck is he?
[40:37.910 --> 40:39.930]  I think he's out of town.
[40:43.050 --> 40:44.570]  Oh, there we go.
[40:45.430 --> 40:46.710]  When does that movie come out?
[40:46.790 --> 40:47.050]  Let's see.
[40:47.110 --> 40:48.010]  Bad boys, Gavin.
[40:49.010 --> 40:49.410]  Yeah.
[40:51.550 --> 40:53.210]  That was the first movie he picked up, too.
[40:53.510 --> 40:55.350]  That might be the franchise
[40:56.890 --> 40:57.290]  where...
[40:57.870 --> 40:59.490]  that I like the most
[40:59.490 --> 41:01.290]  that I want more of the least.
[41:01.630 --> 41:02.130]  You know what I mean?
[41:02.690 --> 41:02.730]  Yeah, totally.
[41:02.730 --> 41:05.410]  We were talking about going through that list
[41:05.410 --> 41:06.450]  and there's so many where it's, like,
[41:06.450 --> 41:07.830]  striking while the iron's ice cold.
[41:08.790 --> 41:10.430]  Yeah, it's like, I'm so glad you guys
[41:10.430 --> 41:12.250]  decided to do another bad boys, but why not
[41:12.250 --> 41:13.290]  15 years ago?
[41:13.770 --> 41:16.370]  No offense, but...
[41:16.370 --> 41:17.810]  Bad boys, it's old boys.
[41:18.170 --> 41:19.810]  And old jokes, you know?
[41:20.210 --> 41:21.990]  Bad boys is old boys.
[41:24.770 --> 41:25.950]  Did the music start again?
[41:26.530 --> 41:27.810]  It did. It sure did.
[41:27.890 --> 41:28.810]  It's nice to have it back.
[41:33.090 --> 41:34.670]  Excuse me, pardon me.
[41:35.270 --> 41:36.030]  Excuse me.
[41:36.270 --> 41:38.370]  Pardon me.
[41:38.370 --> 41:42.830]  Oh, I'm so fucked up.
[41:42.930 --> 41:43.730]  This is a me run, right?
[41:44.650 --> 41:45.030]  Checkpoint.
[41:46.470 --> 41:47.530]  Oh, no. I don't know.
[41:48.090 --> 41:50.570]  He's 85% of the way through here, don't worry about it.
[41:53.270 --> 41:54.430]  Well, he is after this bit.
[41:57.450 --> 41:57.830]  Dude.
[41:58.870 --> 42:00.870]  How long does that guy have to stand there
[42:00.870 --> 42:01.410]  and take it?
[42:02.690 --> 42:04.130]  Let me die!
[42:05.190 --> 42:05.710]  Why isn't it...
[42:05.710 --> 42:07.070]  There we go.
[42:07.430 --> 42:08.350]  Alright, cutscene.
[42:09.150 --> 42:11.290]  Alright, so now you gotta go back here
[42:11.290 --> 42:13.430]  and this will despawn the wraith
[42:13.430 --> 42:14.890]  that's up ahead.
[42:15.810 --> 42:16.610]  That's nice.
[42:17.350 --> 42:19.510]  Go all the way back, and then it'll go like
[42:19.510 --> 42:21.290]  brrp. Now, see, Gavin,
[42:21.490 --> 42:23.410]  he had a time of zero
[42:23.410 --> 42:25.330]  at this point, so you're
[42:25.330 --> 42:27.490]  actually three minutes behind, almost four
[42:27.490 --> 42:29.810]  minutes behind him. Are you worried about that?
[42:30.970 --> 42:31.750]  I'm good.
[42:32.310 --> 42:33.830]  We know 15 minutes,
[42:33.970 --> 42:35.970]  whatever. Whatever that
[42:35.970 --> 42:36.350]  was.
[42:38.170 --> 42:39.410]  I'm gonna get below 15.
[42:41.130 --> 42:41.950]  Now, the only
[42:41.950 --> 42:43.850]  worrying part is you have to do
[42:43.850 --> 42:45.950]  a glitch, and if I fail
[42:45.950 --> 42:48.030]  the glitch, then the run ends, and it's the last
[42:48.030 --> 42:48.630]  thing you have to do.
[42:50.810 --> 42:51.970]  I'm probably like
[42:51.970 --> 42:53.210]  50% on it.
[42:53.570 --> 42:54.050]  Oh, boy.
[42:56.890 --> 42:57.770]  But on the upside,
[42:58.370 --> 42:59.770]  he's hit a checkpoint, so...
[43:00.730 --> 43:00.750]  Yeah.
[43:01.230 --> 43:04.090]  Well, the problem is it's a cutscene,
[43:04.250 --> 43:05.450]  so if you fuck it up, it's
[43:06.070 --> 43:07.930]  dead. I will say, I don't
[43:07.930 --> 43:09.850]  know whose run this is.
[43:10.070 --> 43:11.690]  Mine. Oh, is it?
[43:12.530 --> 43:12.670]  Yeah.
[43:13.790 --> 43:15.830]  Gavin has now jumped to nine minutes,
[43:16.130 --> 43:17.830]  so you somehow are five minutes ahead
[43:17.830 --> 43:19.870]  of him. It's a great eight-minute swing for you there.
[43:23.630 --> 43:25.950]  Oh, what the...
[43:25.950 --> 43:27.630]  Is this... I didn't know this...
[43:27.630 --> 43:28.630]  Is this what you're supposed to do?
[43:29.390 --> 43:31.910]  You're doing some sneaky glitches in this.
[43:32.030 --> 43:33.390]  Master Chief can't swim.
[43:34.410 --> 43:34.650]  Yeah.
[43:35.410 --> 43:37.270]  Luckily, he's in a ship.
[43:39.730 --> 43:41.370]  Gotta ride them walls.
[43:41.870 --> 43:42.670]  Begin a skateboarding.
[43:43.290 --> 43:45.830]  Yeah, no kidding. Have you seen that Japanese...
[43:45.830 --> 43:47.410]  Here I am! That Japanese TV show
[43:47.410 --> 43:49.350]  where they have skateboarders on and they have to just do, like,
[43:49.830 --> 43:50.750]  escalatingly more difficult,
[43:52.590 --> 43:53.830]  uh, like, runs?
[43:53.830 --> 43:55.810]  And they have the one where the ground
[43:55.810 --> 43:57.890]  just gets skinnier and skinnier and skinnier and skinnier
[43:57.890 --> 43:59.010]  and skinnier as they go in the circle.
[43:59.010 --> 44:00.830]  Oh, that sounds great.
[44:01.570 --> 44:03.710]  It's neat. It's just like wipe-out
[44:03.710 --> 44:05.290]  on skateboards? Kind of. It's like a wipe-out,
[44:05.550 --> 44:06.630]  skateboard-based wipe-out.
[44:08.010 --> 44:09.430]  I like it.
[44:12.390 --> 44:13.810]  Here... Boy, Master Chief really
[44:13.810 --> 44:16.050]  fucked up by going full head-on, didn't he?
[44:18.030 --> 44:18.830]  Yeah. In the original.
[44:19.710 --> 44:21.110]  Yeah, he really should have just gone around.
[44:21.110 --> 44:21.810]  Yeah.
[44:22.670 --> 44:24.930]  Now, are we happy? Is this good?
[44:25.190 --> 44:26.110]  This is where we want to be?
[44:27.370 --> 44:28.590]  Uh, maybe.
[44:29.250 --> 44:30.870]  Oh, look at you.
[44:31.130 --> 44:32.510]  Look at you. Big boy.
[44:33.590 --> 44:34.550]  Big boy.
[44:35.550 --> 44:36.850]  Very big boy.
[44:38.390 --> 44:39.250]  There you go.
[44:39.430 --> 44:40.570]  There you go.
[44:40.910 --> 44:42.350]  There we go, there we go, there we go.
[44:43.890 --> 44:44.850]  What the...
[44:44.850 --> 44:46.790]  Okay, going straight down.
[44:46.830 --> 44:47.670]  What's happening?
[44:48.550 --> 44:49.830]  This is the first thing I did
[44:49.830 --> 44:51.670]  in the citadel when I went to the...
[44:53.770 --> 44:55.990]  So now we just gotta wait for that to catch up
[44:55.990 --> 44:57.070]  and it'll shoot in.
[44:57.390 --> 44:59.710]  And the glitch is we gotta position the specter
[44:59.710 --> 45:00.990]  to slide down
[45:00.990 --> 45:03.550]  and we gotta fall at a certain time.
[45:03.830 --> 45:05.010]  And if it works,
[45:05.310 --> 45:07.730]  it will spawn the specter into the final
[45:07.730 --> 45:08.430]  boss area.
[45:10.170 --> 45:11.830]  Which is what you have to do?
[45:12.450 --> 45:13.770]  Which is what we have
[45:13.770 --> 45:14.190]  to do.
[45:14.190 --> 45:14.930]  Okay.
[45:15.590 --> 45:18.330]  This is actually the only way to beat this game
[45:18.330 --> 45:20.210]  on lasso. Like, you have to
[45:20.210 --> 45:22.010]  do this or else it doesn't work.
[45:22.090 --> 45:22.430]  Wow.
[45:25.370 --> 45:26.290]  I only got a
[45:26.290 --> 45:27.830]  checkpoint, but that doesn't really matter.
[45:28.610 --> 45:30.110]  Gotta wait for the thing,
[45:30.470 --> 45:31.610]  the... what was it? Scarab?
[45:32.110 --> 45:34.270]  Yes, a scarab. And then Johnson yells
[45:34.270 --> 45:35.750]  and he starts shooting at it.
[45:36.910 --> 45:38.070]  Me, my friends, and my chance.
[45:38.070 --> 45:38.630]  Oh, I'm clear.
[45:43.610 --> 45:44.410]  And he goes...
[45:45.410 --> 45:45.830]  Baaaaa!
[45:52.210 --> 45:52.630]  Baaaaa!
[45:53.250 --> 45:54.650]  So now, let's get into position.
[45:55.030 --> 45:56.410]  It's funny to see it from up here.
[45:58.970 --> 46:00.310]  Do you know when to fall?
[46:02.330 --> 46:04.430]  I just gotta try to time it and get
[46:04.430 --> 46:06.750]  out when...
[46:14.410 --> 46:14.990]  Nailed it.
[46:15.590 --> 46:17.090]  Oh god. Nailed it.
[46:17.090 --> 46:17.130]  Nailed it.
[46:20.950 --> 46:21.590]  Nailed it.
[46:21.590 --> 46:22.870]  Go, go, go.
[46:24.130 --> 46:24.630]  Nailed it.
[46:25.810 --> 46:26.890]  Good job, buddy.
[46:27.010 --> 46:29.230]  Get in it. Oh, you did it. My run.
[46:29.730 --> 46:31.090]  So is this a checkpoint then?
[46:32.850 --> 46:33.210]  Uh, yeah.
[46:33.330 --> 46:33.950]  Now we should be fine.
[46:36.270 --> 46:36.990]  Hold on.
[46:37.210 --> 46:39.030]  Get the fuck out. What is happening?
[46:40.210 --> 46:41.310]  I can't. I don't want
[46:41.310 --> 46:43.110]  them in my vehicle. I need them to leave.
[46:44.010 --> 46:44.650]  Can you kill them?
[46:46.010 --> 46:46.370]  Leave.
[46:46.710 --> 46:47.430]  Why do you need them to leave?
[46:48.510 --> 46:50.350]  Because I need to get Johnson in it.
[46:51.350 --> 46:53.130]  You're wasting a lot of time.
[46:53.150 --> 46:54.030]  Yeah, no kidding. I am!
[46:54.690 --> 46:55.550]  Oh my god.
[47:02.050 --> 47:02.770]  I do.
[47:02.910 --> 47:04.650]  I like that he's here. You know better than that.
[47:07.070 --> 47:08.690]  So now what? Okay, now we gotta spawn
[47:08.690 --> 47:10.350]  a Johnson. Okay.
[47:10.710 --> 47:12.150]  What? We gotta do some wiggles.
[47:12.930 --> 47:14.130]  It spawns a second
[47:14.130 --> 47:15.370]  Johnson? Oh god.
[47:15.490 --> 47:17.930]  So you're trying to spawn a new Johnson.
[47:18.150 --> 47:19.530]  This really is sausage play.
[47:19.690 --> 47:20.770]  It is.
[47:21.510 --> 47:23.230]  We gotta get this second Johnson in here.
[47:23.250 --> 47:24.290]  For god's sake.
[47:28.260 --> 47:28.760]  Come on.
[47:29.600 --> 47:31.220]  Give me a second Johnson.
[47:32.680 --> 47:33.240]  Oof.
[47:34.100 --> 47:36.080]  Oof. Quit stalling.
[47:36.380 --> 47:38.040]  Why aren't you spawning
[47:38.040 --> 47:39.740]  me a...
[47:39.740 --> 47:41.320]  Why do you need two?
[47:41.320 --> 47:42.920]  Hang tight, ma'am.
[47:43.020 --> 47:45.460]  Because it clones
[47:45.460 --> 47:47.560]  and then it does more damage to the boss.
[47:47.620 --> 47:49.220]  You don't have to actually fight the boss.
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.460]  I think I might have to reset
[47:51.460 --> 47:53.480]  this run because we should have a second
[47:53.480 --> 47:55.200]  Johnson. The whole run or just go back to the
[47:55.600 --> 47:57.000]  checkpoint? Just the last
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.080]  checkpoint. Sorry, Nick.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.600]  Sorry, Nick!
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.420]  This feels like a Geoff run.
[48:04.840 --> 48:04.920]  No.
[48:08.320 --> 48:09.740]  Feels like this is probably where it's gonna happen.
[48:10.560 --> 48:11.640]  It should.
[48:13.120 --> 48:13.840]  I'm gonna get my
[48:13.840 --> 48:14.580]  snipe off.
[48:15.780 --> 48:17.040]  I go, bah!
[48:17.840 --> 48:18.900]  Now I'm gonna run.
[48:20.320 --> 48:21.480]  Go invisible.
[48:23.540 --> 48:25.120]  Let's flip this.
[48:27.160 --> 48:27.880]  Okay.
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.180]  Here he comes.
[48:34.280 --> 48:35.980]  Here we go. Here we go.
[48:36.080 --> 48:36.640]  Here we go.
[48:36.640 --> 48:38.420]  Sergeant Johnson, get in.
[48:38.500 --> 48:39.200]  Uh-oh. Okay.
[48:39.720 --> 48:40.980]  Stay away from them.
[48:44.460 --> 48:45.600]  Don't you come over here.
[48:46.380 --> 48:47.440]  Don't you fucking dare.
[48:48.020 --> 48:50.800]  I will fucking drive you over so quick.
[48:51.080 --> 48:51.660]  Go die.
[48:53.880 --> 48:54.940]  Oh my god.
[48:57.760 --> 48:58.820]  Push him off.
[49:01.200 --> 49:02.180]  There we go.
[49:02.540 --> 49:02.940]  Awesome!
[49:04.520 --> 49:07.160]  And now we gotta get Johnson hip-thrusting.
[49:07.400 --> 49:08.840]  Gotta fuck up another
[49:09.960 --> 49:10.380]  Johnson.
[49:11.620 --> 49:13.040]  Watching Andrew knock his
[49:13.040 --> 49:14.940]  teammate off the bridge reminded me
[49:14.940 --> 49:16.780]  of another great thing about Gavin that I love.
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.720]  Anytime he plays a video game like Halo
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.300]  and there are other
[49:20.790 --> 49:22.760]  NPC characters on your team, he likes to kill
[49:22.760 --> 49:24.960]  them immediately. He doesn't wanna get to
[49:24.960 --> 49:26.860]  know them and grow attached to them
[49:26.860 --> 49:28.240]  and then watch them die down the road.
[49:28.580 --> 49:30.600]  He'll just put a bullet in their head and take their ammo
[49:30.600 --> 49:31.240]  right at them.
[49:32.060 --> 49:33.600]  You know what? Respectful.
[49:34.120 --> 49:35.060]  I always appreciate that.
[49:35.220 --> 49:40.980]  And you gotta
[49:40.980 --> 49:41.700]  throw a grenade.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.080]  I don't know.
[49:44.600 --> 49:45.840]  That gets them out of the vehicle.
[49:47.860 --> 49:49.040]  Now I grab this.
[49:50.040 --> 49:50.620]  Dual wield.
[49:51.480 --> 49:52.180]  Hop up.
[49:52.700 --> 49:53.040]  Wow.
[49:54.760 --> 49:55.500]  Where even are they?
[49:55.660 --> 49:57.300]  Damn, this really did feel like a Geoff run, huh?
[49:58.500 --> 49:59.080]  Oh shit!
[49:59.740 --> 50:00.100]  Andrew.
[50:00.840 --> 50:02.420]  He dropped one of his plasma.
[50:02.960 --> 50:03.780]  Why did you do that?
[50:04.940 --> 50:06.580]  Because you want it to be an Eric run?
[50:08.580 --> 50:08.880]  No,
[50:09.160 --> 50:10.960]  it's sweet. Listen, we're gonna nail it.
[50:11.820 --> 50:13.100]  You need to nail him in the head with a
[50:13.100 --> 50:14.700]  pistol. I'm working on it.
[50:14.900 --> 50:15.860]  You got one round left.
[50:20.120 --> 50:21.280]  Is this like the boss
[50:21.280 --> 50:21.680]  or something?
[50:22.240 --> 50:24.420]  Nah, it's just a guy.
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.860]  This is the final boss of the game.
[50:26.200 --> 50:26.640]  Oh, is it?
[50:27.400 --> 50:27.920]  Yeah.
[50:28.420 --> 50:30.300]  That's right, you finish the game playing as the Arbiter, don't you?
[50:30.800 --> 50:31.160]  Yeah.
[50:31.820 --> 50:32.840]  That's weird.
[50:36.040 --> 50:38.640]  That's the alien version of Master Chief you're fighting.
[50:39.880 --> 50:40.700]  He's their hero.
[50:44.970 --> 50:46.170]  Come on, get him!
[50:46.710 --> 50:46.890]  Get him!
[50:48.730 --> 50:49.770]  Jesus Christ.
[50:51.350 --> 50:53.090]  Let's see how we got...
[50:53.090 --> 50:54.750]  We got a Johnson over there.
[50:55.530 --> 50:56.910]  We got one down there.
[50:56.910 --> 50:58.250]  Another one.
[51:01.050 --> 51:02.170]  Any other Johnson?
[51:02.410 --> 51:03.550]  I think that might be it.
[51:04.050 --> 51:06.430]  Oh, is he just supposed to stay across on the bridge the whole time?
[51:06.750 --> 51:08.930]  Yeah, he's just supposed to be there
[51:08.930 --> 51:11.070]  helping. But if you bring the three across
[51:11.070 --> 51:12.790]  it spawns a new one and you have the
[51:12.790 --> 51:14.670]  three others sniping him.
[51:14.950 --> 51:16.470]  This guy will not die.
[51:16.750 --> 51:18.410]  Yeah, he's just eating it, dude.
[51:19.590 --> 51:20.750]  Tough for a speed run, huh?
[51:20.850 --> 51:22.570]  There we go. There we go!
[51:23.170 --> 51:24.830]  Hey! Happy
[51:24.830 --> 51:26.870]  birthday, Gavin!
[51:27.430 --> 51:27.750]  Okay.
[51:28.370 --> 51:30.190]  Hold on, let's see. We're not there yet.
[51:30.410 --> 51:31.870]  There we go. Now it ends.
[51:32.610 --> 51:33.610]  Where does your time stop?
[51:35.130 --> 51:36.010]  Uh, let's see.
[51:36.330 --> 51:37.390]  Skip this.
[51:39.470 --> 51:41.150]  And let me skip it.
[51:41.150 --> 51:43.430]  You said skip this and you didn't skip anything.
[51:44.110 --> 51:44.170]  Oh.
[51:46.690 --> 51:47.250]  Ha!
[51:47.790 --> 51:49.250]  Completely different between those.
[51:49.250 --> 51:49.670]  Ha!
[51:53.710 --> 51:56.870]  Go to the other one.
[51:56.930 --> 51:57.150]  Yeah.
[52:00.810 --> 52:03.230]  That looks more like it.
[52:03.590 --> 52:03.830]  Yeah.
[52:08.900 --> 52:09.480]  Ha!
[52:10.780 --> 52:11.520]  Ha!
[52:12.580 --> 52:12.600]  Ha!
[52:12.600 --> 52:12.620]  Ha!
[52:12.980 --> 52:13.420]  Ha!
[52:13.960 --> 52:14.140]  Ha!
[52:21.260 --> 52:21.740]  Uh...
[52:22.260 --> 52:23.800]  Switching the graphics has been a real
[52:23.800 --> 52:26.240]  boon. For anybody that may be watching
[52:26.240 --> 52:28.020]  this that isn't familiar with the Master Chief Collection,
[52:28.160 --> 52:30.140]  there's an option that lets you
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.980]  switch the graphics between the
[52:31.980 --> 52:34.040]  original and the new updated versions
[52:34.040 --> 52:34.780]  on the fly.
[52:35.980 --> 52:36.460]  Ha!
[52:38.360 --> 52:38.760]  Ha!
[52:39.620 --> 52:40.220]  That's old.
[52:40.420 --> 52:40.800]  Let me tell you.
[52:42.020 --> 52:44.440]  The old one's a little underwhelming by comparison, isn't it?
[52:45.180 --> 52:45.580]  Yeah.
[52:46.580 --> 52:48.440]  It was pretty special when it happened, huh?
[52:48.520 --> 52:49.400]  Like when it came out. Very cool.
[52:50.660 --> 52:51.360]  That's new.
[52:52.260 --> 52:52.460]  What?
[52:55.980 --> 52:58.000]  I guess it's not new anymore. Newer.
[52:58.720 --> 52:58.960]  Yeah.
[53:01.160 --> 53:02.380]  Gross. What's he look like normal?
[53:04.120 --> 53:04.840]  Let's find out.
[53:07.360 --> 53:07.880]  Ha!
[53:24.650 --> 53:26.570]  You think this is affecting your time?
[53:28.070 --> 53:29.610]  No! I didn't think about that!
[53:29.670 --> 53:31.450]  You did not think about that!
[53:31.570 --> 53:33.530]  Are you a lunatic?
[53:33.970 --> 53:35.730]  No, I'm sure it's done.
[53:35.890 --> 53:37.210]  You're sure? It has to be done.
[53:37.330 --> 53:39.110]  It was still counting after he died.
[53:41.430 --> 53:42.810]  How fucking funny would that be?
[53:43.310 --> 53:43.790]  Oh!
[53:45.570 --> 53:46.470]  Dicking around.
[53:46.770 --> 53:47.790]  Loses two minutes.
[53:49.810 --> 53:50.570]  Give me the time!
[53:52.010 --> 53:52.750]  Oh boy.
[53:53.510 --> 53:54.650]  Oh my god!
[53:54.930 --> 53:56.050]  Give me the time!
[54:03.820 --> 54:04.620]  It's creepy.
[54:04.840 --> 54:06.700]  What's Gavin's time? 15 minutes or something?
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.940]  If his clock's in at like 1630,
[54:09.040 --> 54:09.800]  I'm going to laugh so fucking hard.
[54:12.420 --> 54:25.110]  Man, Halo 2 is a weird one.
[54:27.910 --> 54:29.250]  Did they kind of avoid the
[54:29.250 --> 54:30.950]  grave mine thing in the third game?
[54:32.370 --> 54:32.850]  No.
[54:33.530 --> 54:35.170]  It's kind of a central part of it.
[54:35.430 --> 54:35.770]  Yeah.
[54:37.090 --> 54:39.210]  You have to go and retrieve
[54:39.210 --> 54:40.110]  Cortana from it.
[54:40.670 --> 54:43.230]  He's not like, I have so many questions
[54:43.230 --> 54:44.130]  for you now.
[54:44.530 --> 54:47.270]  No, but you get like the broken up Cortana fragments.
[54:47.670 --> 54:48.290]  Oh, that's true.
[54:49.370 --> 54:49.850]  1054!
[54:51.190 --> 54:52.410]  You beat Ray's time, I think.
[54:53.350 --> 54:53.830]  Ray?
[54:53.830 --> 54:56.110]  Ray LMAO, you lost.
[54:57.410 --> 54:58.790]  So let's confirm
[54:58.790 --> 55:00.750]  options and career.
[55:02.770 --> 55:04.850]  Campaign timing, Halo 2.
[55:05.710 --> 55:06.370]  Wow.
[55:06.750 --> 55:07.670]  Legendary.
[55:09.570 --> 55:11.810]  Will he notice this?
[55:12.290 --> 55:12.930]  Or do you think
[55:13.470 --> 55:14.470]  he'll see this video?
[55:15.350 --> 55:15.510]  Yeah.
[55:18.330 --> 55:19.530]  Hey, Journey.
[55:22.410 --> 55:22.850]  What?
[55:24.790 --> 55:25.230]  1802.
[55:26.470 --> 55:26.910]  What?
[55:27.830 --> 55:28.650]  Yeah, he's got you.
[55:29.010 --> 55:30.210]  He's got you by about three minutes.
[55:30.230 --> 55:31.050]  Yeah, you lost, dude.
[55:32.650 --> 55:33.530]  What happened?
[55:33.970 --> 55:34.410]  1802.
[55:34.630 --> 55:36.810]  We just saw it, though.
[55:37.030 --> 55:38.190]  It's down there at 1802.
[55:39.310 --> 55:41.610]  I was ahead of Ray, though.
[55:42.270 --> 55:43.730]  No, Ray's at 1130.
[55:43.810 --> 55:44.950]  You're at 1802.
[55:46.910 --> 55:47.870]  No, wait a minute.
[55:47.870 --> 55:49.430]  We're gonna... wait a minute.
[55:51.070 --> 55:51.790]  Wait a minute.
[55:52.490 --> 55:53.630]  We're gonna reboot it.
[55:55.890 --> 55:57.090]  We're gonna reboot it.
[55:57.830 --> 55:59.870]  And then we're gonna go...
[56:00.610 --> 56:02.370]  And we're gonna look at the leaderboard again.
[56:03.550 --> 56:04.430]  Campaign timing,
[56:04.570 --> 56:05.230]  Halo 2.
[56:06.810 --> 56:08.130]  We're gonna go all the way down
[56:08.130 --> 56:09.670]  to the last one, the Great Journey.
[56:10.890 --> 56:11.890]  Legendary, and then...
[56:13.730 --> 56:14.170]  Friends.
[56:14.430 --> 56:16.010]  And it's loading, and I'll be number one.
[56:16.010 --> 56:17.190]  As I should be.
[56:17.450 --> 56:17.990]  Yeah!
[56:20.950 --> 56:22.990]  That's what we told you, Gavin.
[56:23.710 --> 56:23.850]  1054.
[56:24.250 --> 56:25.790]  Happy birthday, Gavin.
[56:26.190 --> 56:27.690]  Happy birthday.
[56:28.470 --> 56:29.130]  Happy birthday, Gavin.
[56:29.130 --> 56:29.870]  Happy birthday.
[56:31.750 --> 56:34.050]  Thank you so much for watching.

[56:41.990 --> 56:43.690]  our socials, the Regulation Pod.
[56:43.690 --> 56:45.710]  Pretty easy to find. Outside of our Twitter,
[56:46.350 --> 56:47.530]  which is just Regulation Pod.
[56:48.510 --> 56:49.610]  I'm happy with this run.
[56:49.830 --> 56:51.470]  This is a good video. Great run. I had a lot of fun.
[56:51.550 --> 56:53.170]  I had a lot of fun, too. And actually,
[56:53.390 --> 56:55.690]  it brings up something I've been meaning to talk to you guys
[56:55.690 --> 56:57.130]  real fast before we nod out here.
[56:57.790 --> 56:59.710]  You know how my birthday and
[57:00.410 --> 57:01.830]  Eric and Gavin's birthdays
[57:01.830 --> 57:03.770]  are all, like, right next to each other, pretty much?
[57:04.370 --> 57:04.670]  Sure.
[57:05.390 --> 57:07.190]  What if, Nick and Andrew,
[57:07.450 --> 57:09.630]  you guys changed your birthdays to be in
[57:09.630 --> 57:10.350]  May or June?
[57:10.910 --> 57:11.250]  Wow.
[57:12.470 --> 57:14.210]  And then that way, we're all just right together.
[57:14.770 --> 57:15.550]  Something to think about.
[57:16.650 --> 57:18.430]  I'll talk to my mom. When is your birthday, Nick?
[57:19.050 --> 57:19.390]  December.
[57:20.530 --> 57:22.490]  See, I'm August. I feel like I'm already kind of
[57:22.490 --> 57:24.070]  close. Yeah, I'm the furthest. I'm around.
[57:24.390 --> 57:26.070]  I'm the furthest. It's Nick.
[57:26.510 --> 57:28.450]  Nick is definitely a huge problem, but if we could
[57:28.450 --> 57:30.410]  bump you up to even July, Andrew, that'd
[57:30.410 --> 57:32.410]  be great. I don't mind that.
[57:32.510 --> 57:33.510]  I like a July birthday.
[57:34.210 --> 57:36.510]  And I'm close, too. I'm the fifth. Like, it's a week?
[57:36.610 --> 57:38.530]  Yeah, that's fine. Anyway, thank you
[57:38.530 --> 57:39.650]  so much for watching.
[57:40.530 --> 57:41.730]  Bye. Bye.
