[00:00.000 --> 00:04.180]  Hello and welcome to a regulation heist of gang members. Gang fight.
[00:04.340 --> 00:05.540]  Taking out these gang members, dude.
[00:07.900 --> 00:09.940]  Gavin keeps trying to shoot me with an EMP.
[00:10.600 --> 00:13.700]  It's not an EMP, it's a... an alien blaster of some sort.
[00:13.880 --> 00:14.100]  Oh.
[00:14.980 --> 00:15.780]  I'm here to help!
[00:16.820 --> 00:18.660]  Why are the cops after me now? What the?
[00:19.360 --> 00:19.580]  Ah!
[00:20.480 --> 00:23.740]  Oh, there's a helicopter. What is going on? It's crazy over here.
[00:24.800 --> 00:25.480]  You can make it.
[00:25.480 --> 00:25.840]  Hahaha!
[00:27.640 --> 00:27.880]  Ah!
[00:28.940 --> 00:30.500]  Hey, can you give me a pill?
[00:30.500 --> 00:33.440]  They came over to help. They were of no help. I've died.
[00:34.480 --> 00:35.000]  Well...
[00:35.720 --> 00:36.540]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.360]  Whoops. There you go.
[00:38.700 --> 00:38.980]  Thanks.
[00:40.200 --> 00:40.700]  Oh!
[00:41.380 --> 00:41.840]  Hahaha!
[00:47.820 --> 00:49.440]  I can save you all.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.160]  Is it by inviting us?
[00:51.980 --> 00:52.180]  Yep.
[00:52.380 --> 00:52.840]  Thank you.
[00:54.040 --> 00:55.180]  Nick started a gang attack.
[00:55.180 --> 00:59.540]  Oh, that's not a cop. That's a cop I shot. Not... oops.
[00:59.960 --> 01:01.280]  You did not, um...
[01:01.280 --> 01:02.340]  Wait, that is a cop?
[01:02.560 --> 01:03.660]  Gang attack pass, baby.
[01:03.700 --> 01:04.140]  Oh, that is not a cop.
[01:04.720 --> 01:05.820]  That's a cop you shot.
[01:06.900 --> 01:09.740]  I killed 15 guys. I got 11 headshots. I'm good at this.
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.980]  I thought I was fighting the gang.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.920]  Think about it. We could have done that, and then, like, Lester would have called us right away.
[01:15.260 --> 01:15.760]  Did you invite?
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.420]  Sure did.
[01:17.580 --> 01:18.200]  Thank you.
[01:19.280 --> 01:21.420]  Aw, man. I had to pay money to lose that wanted level?
[01:21.700 --> 01:22.260]  Of course.
[01:22.260 --> 01:26.200]  I'm gonna say I didn't have a choice or difficulty on this one.
[01:26.380 --> 01:27.240]  Oh, is that right?
[01:28.720 --> 01:29.740]  Do you believe him?
[01:29.780 --> 01:31.160]  I did not. I looked at it.
[01:31.260 --> 01:33.640]  Well, I assume you said it before you start any of the heists.
[01:33.940 --> 01:36.800]  That's not true. I swapped it for the last one.
[01:37.000 --> 01:37.200]  Oh.
[01:37.520 --> 01:38.360]  The last one we did was hard.
[01:38.620 --> 01:39.920]  Maybe there's no killing in this.
[01:40.600 --> 01:41.520]  That seems wrong.
[01:41.620 --> 01:41.840]  Yeah.
[01:42.020 --> 01:43.500]  But this is a series of funding.
[01:44.100 --> 01:47.180]  Come to the warehouse and help move two vans loaded with product.
[01:49.160 --> 01:53.980]  That's too easy, and I don't... and I can't... put on your fucking mask!
[01:55.960 --> 01:58.320]  Guys, I'm covered in blood. I don't know what happened.
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.420]  Is this when... is this... are we gonna see the cutscene that we saw, like, the very first time?
[02:04.620 --> 02:07.120]  Like, when we started playing these and this is, like, what you were in the middle of?
[02:08.300 --> 02:10.080]  I don't know. I don't remember that cutscene, is it?
[02:11.040 --> 02:11.360]  Oh.
[02:11.640 --> 02:12.260]  I don't know.
[02:12.260 --> 02:18.580]  It seems to me that if you keep this up, maybe he won't... well, he's very happy.
[02:18.700 --> 02:22.980]  And trust me, a happy Trevor is a good Trevor, and we all want a good Trevor.
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.860]  I mean, he suffered a lot.
[02:25.160 --> 02:26.000]  We can't skip this?
[02:26.580 --> 02:27.560]  He was a horrific, bloodthirsty maniac...
[02:28.440 --> 02:29.560]  I'm just, you know, I'm just checking.
[02:30.360 --> 02:31.680]  Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[02:31.720 --> 02:31.820]  Yeah.
[02:31.980 --> 02:32.720]  It's a good thought.
[02:32.800 --> 02:33.800]  I like the thought, too.
[02:34.600 --> 02:35.900]  Can we kill Ron once this is over?
[02:36.820 --> 02:37.540]  I'd love to.
[02:37.980 --> 02:39.260]  And you can get to know him better.
[02:39.260 --> 02:44.560]  A kind man who likes animals and children and smoking crystal while the sun sets.
[02:46.260 --> 02:47.740]  Smoking crystal while the sun sets.
[02:48.740 --> 02:50.060]  Do you like animals and children, Gavin?
[02:51.540 --> 02:52.480]  Gavin, are you still here?
[02:53.100 --> 02:53.280]  Gavin?
[02:55.740 --> 02:57.440]  Is he still dealing with the piss room?
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.800]  Oh, cool, yeah, we gotta get Craig in here.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.040]  Hey, you know what? Just in case.
[03:03.540 --> 03:03.700]  Yep.
[03:05.100 --> 03:06.100]  Is Gavin here?
[03:06.860 --> 03:07.900]  I heard him in the background.
[03:07.900 --> 03:10.700]  I thought I heard it, too, but I don't hear him now.
[03:13.900 --> 03:14.220]  Gavin?
[03:17.180 --> 03:18.060]  That ain't good.
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.200]  No, that's not good.
[03:20.700 --> 03:23.680]  How's he gonna know what we're supposed to do when he's not here listening to Ron?
[03:24.220 --> 03:25.620]  He's not gonna get all the story.
[03:26.720 --> 03:27.640]  Series of weed!
[03:28.300 --> 03:28.860]  Now we're talking.
[03:30.140 --> 03:32.400]  Okay, this is for the heist leader to set up the setup.
[03:32.540 --> 03:33.340]  Maybe we should wait?
[03:34.520 --> 03:35.700]  Do you know the way to Polito Bay?
[03:36.600 --> 03:36.880]  I'm in.
[03:36.880 --> 03:38.060]  Oh, okay, cool.
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.280]  Hey, it says difficulty normal.
[03:40.500 --> 03:40.960]  Oh, now we can do hard.
[03:40.960 --> 03:41.680]  No, he switched it, look!
[03:42.380 --> 03:43.740]  Hey, it's hard now, Gavin!
[03:44.700 --> 03:47.540]  Gavin, we're going after weed, man!
[03:48.120 --> 03:50.240]  Where were you? Were you rolling around in the cat piss or what?
[03:51.140 --> 03:52.040]  No, I'm in my own piss.
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.940]  Oh, you're rolling around in your own piss.
[03:54.520 --> 03:57.220]  Well, I was just putting it somewhere else. Didn't want to hold it.
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.920]  Okay, mask style.
[04:02.380 --> 04:03.900]  This is not... nope, uh-uh.
[04:04.940 --> 04:05.880]  Oh, I'm a lookout?
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.400]  On the west side.
[04:07.540 --> 04:08.840]  Dude, you've got to be kidding me.
[04:08.960 --> 04:11.340]  They don't have the fucking rat mask and they don't have tape.
[04:11.460 --> 04:13.020]  This is the worst. This game sucks.
[04:13.040 --> 04:13.940]  I'll go paper bag.
[04:15.140 --> 04:17.900]  Hey, Eric, why don't you go on the ground team?
[04:18.140 --> 04:19.540]  And then I'll be... look at east.
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.200]  I can go ground team, sure.
[04:21.240 --> 04:21.880]  You go ground team.
[04:23.460 --> 04:24.560]  Why am I doing ground team?
[04:25.860 --> 04:26.620]  Gavin's ground team.
[04:26.720 --> 04:27.000]  Oh, okay.
[04:27.700 --> 04:30.600]  Team tape sticks together and so does, uh... no bad ideas.
[04:31.000 --> 04:31.400]  Got it.
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.040]  Yeah.
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  How many teams are there?
[04:34.760 --> 04:36.920]  Oh, I see. You guys are both lookouts, but from other sides.
[04:37.220 --> 04:37.720]  Yeah, we're both lookouts.
[04:37.920 --> 04:40.420]  I'm gonna do button up and a help me mask.
[04:40.600 --> 04:44.180]  Okay, I'm also doing a help me mask, but I think I'm gonna be...
[04:48.220 --> 04:49.240]  Yeah, I think we're good here.
[04:50.320 --> 04:54.480]  I had a rec league hockey game right before this and I did not have time to change.
[04:54.800 --> 04:55.260]  Is that right?
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.620]  Oh, did you?
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.080]  Oh, I see, like in your thing.
[04:59.720 --> 05:00.360]  Hey, you know what?
[05:02.540 --> 05:03.660]  It's my weekend with the kid.
[05:03.660 --> 05:06.080]  Oh, damn, you drew the same thing I did, Gavin.
[05:07.000 --> 05:07.820]  Oh, damn it.
[05:09.820 --> 05:11.280]  I mean, I called out the button up.
[05:11.500 --> 05:12.340]  Yeah, I heard you.
[05:12.780 --> 05:13.380]  That's fair.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.080]  Alright, Gavin, where to?
[05:15.800 --> 05:16.380]  Oh, boy.
[05:18.800 --> 05:19.480]  Sawmill, fellas.
[05:19.980 --> 05:21.120]  I don't know if it'll let me on this.
[05:21.820 --> 05:22.660]  Oh, this is a one seer?
[05:22.960 --> 05:23.580]  Yeah, it might be.
[05:24.020 --> 05:25.600]  I'll grab something else, I guess.
[05:25.980 --> 05:26.720]  Is there a shoulder?
[05:26.720 --> 05:27.700]  Are we going to the same place?
[05:27.940 --> 05:28.760]  Are you going to the sawmill?
[05:29.300 --> 05:29.540]  Yeah.
[05:30.100 --> 05:30.320]  Okay.
[05:31.860 --> 05:32.040]  Let's go, boys.
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.060]  We're just, like, at different levels.
[05:33.960 --> 05:35.180]  I like that thing, Gavin.
[05:35.380 --> 05:36.100]  How fast is it?
[05:36.960 --> 05:37.500]  Not very.
[05:39.500 --> 05:40.460]  Oh, shit.
[05:42.520 --> 05:44.540]  What a pointless fucking wall.
[05:45.260 --> 05:45.900]  Look at this.
[05:46.500 --> 05:47.140]  Get over here.
[05:47.220 --> 05:47.860]  Look at what I crashed.
[05:47.940 --> 05:49.760]  Look at how fucking dumb this is.
[05:49.980 --> 05:51.280]  Why did they do this?
[05:52.100 --> 05:53.140]  What is that?
[05:53.820 --> 05:54.600]  What's the point?
[05:54.660 --> 05:55.080]  This thing?
[05:55.400 --> 05:56.760]  Yeah, what's the point?
[05:56.820 --> 05:59.420]  This is where Nick got his car stuck last time, isn't it?
[05:59.420 --> 05:59.720]  Oh, yeah.
[06:00.460 --> 06:02.480]  Oh, this guy is cute.
[06:02.480 --> 06:04.980]  Nick had vengeance on his mind.
[06:05.200 --> 06:05.720]  That was so funny.
[06:05.720 --> 06:07.620]  That guy was giving me the finger the whole way.
[06:07.820 --> 06:08.940]  Oh, I would be, too, man.
[06:09.000 --> 06:09.640]  That was crazy.
[06:10.460 --> 06:10.840]  Excuse me.
[06:11.360 --> 06:11.780]  Shortcut.
[06:12.040 --> 06:12.560]  It's a good one.
[06:13.180 --> 06:13.640]  Great car.
[06:14.040 --> 06:14.660]  Oh, I'm following.
[06:15.320 --> 06:16.040]  I don't think that's a shortcut.
[06:17.380 --> 06:18.220]  We'll find out.
[06:19.560 --> 06:20.260]  Oh, my God.
[06:22.760 --> 06:23.180]  Wahoo!
[06:24.040 --> 06:25.320]  Oh, you got some hair.
[06:25.540 --> 06:25.700]  Oh, shit!
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.000]  I think we're about to be walking.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  I think I drove on you, like, while you hit the air.
[06:32.140 --> 06:32.780]  Oh, shit.
[06:33.660 --> 06:34.460]  You all right?
[06:37.540 --> 06:38.760]  We'll wait for you for a second.
[06:39.820 --> 06:40.740]  Make sure you're all right.
[06:44.320 --> 06:44.900]  Oh, there's someone over there.
[06:44.900 --> 06:45.860]  What happened in Top Gear?
[06:46.220 --> 06:46.740]  There's Andrew!
[06:47.420 --> 06:48.540]  Look out, Gavin!
[06:50.840 --> 06:52.280]  Get back on the road, Andrew!
[06:53.280 --> 06:53.860]  Thanks, Nick.
[06:54.000 --> 06:54.920]  Oh, my God.
[06:55.020 --> 06:55.920]  Get back in your car!
[06:59.700 --> 07:00.840]  Come on, buddy!
[07:03.280 --> 07:03.340]  Andrew?
[07:03.420 --> 07:03.800]  Gavin?
[07:04.540 --> 07:04.960]  Are you all right?
[07:08.220 --> 07:09.800]  I couldn't remember who got hurt.
[07:11.520 --> 07:12.760]  Oh, you guys aren't shortcutting?
[07:12.840 --> 07:13.200]  You're insane.
[07:13.480 --> 07:14.160]  I'm shortcutting.
[07:14.360 --> 07:15.300]  Oh, we're shortcutting.
[07:17.840 --> 07:20.240]  I don't know how much of a shortcut it is, though.
[07:21.540 --> 07:22.200]  That's a tree.
[07:22.400 --> 07:24.160]  Oh, my God.
[07:24.320 --> 07:25.220]  Oh, shit.
[07:25.500 --> 07:26.240]  Oh, shit.
[07:28.940 --> 07:30.300]  Oh, back to the start!
[07:31.220 --> 07:32.960]  Oh, yeah, because it's the heist already.
[07:34.900 --> 07:35.680]  That's my bad.
[07:35.740 --> 07:37.900]  I should not maybe drive that.
[07:38.500 --> 07:38.760]  Yep.
[07:43.970 --> 07:47.310]  You want to hop in one of the enclosed vehicles, Gavin?
[07:47.850 --> 07:50.730]  Yeah, because I got killed by a tree on the way to the heist.
[07:52.230 --> 07:53.470]  Can you imagine if you were like,
[07:53.550 --> 07:54.850]  Hey, we lost half the ground team.
[07:54.950 --> 07:56.690]  We hit a tree on the way.
[07:57.870 --> 07:58.310]  Oh.
[08:00.230 --> 08:00.950]  All right.
[08:01.670 --> 08:02.450]  Weren't we just outside?
[08:03.050 --> 08:03.350]  Yep.
[08:06.830 --> 08:09.990]  I wonder if we drive by that tree if we'll see your impaled body.
[08:10.630 --> 08:11.810]  All right, Gavin, I'm with you.
[08:12.450 --> 08:13.670]  Okay, let's take this.
[08:16.810 --> 08:17.450]  I don't think that worked.
[08:17.630 --> 08:17.850]  He lived.
[08:18.750 --> 08:19.370]  Let's get this one.
[08:20.130 --> 08:20.630]  Oh, there you go.
[08:24.420 --> 08:25.300]  Oh, Nick.
[08:25.420 --> 08:25.960]  Spin out.
[08:26.760 --> 08:27.060]  Whoa!
[08:27.060 --> 08:27.300]  Whoa!
[08:29.660 --> 08:30.360]  Oh, dear.
[08:34.200 --> 08:39.560]  Oh, that guy got lucky.
[08:39.680 --> 08:40.200]  He turned right.
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.080]  Let me tell you.
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.060]  He knew what was coming.
[08:42.280 --> 08:42.600]  Oh, yeah.
[08:43.600 --> 08:45.020]  Was it about to come from you as well?
[08:45.440 --> 08:46.660]  Oh, my God.
[08:48.700 --> 08:50.120]  Yes, yes, it was.
[08:51.600 --> 08:52.400]  Oh, shit.
[08:52.480 --> 08:52.760]  Sorry.
[08:53.640 --> 08:56.580]  You pit maneuvered me about three times already on this journey.
[08:57.060 --> 08:57.380]  Yeah.
[09:00.560 --> 09:01.200]  Oh.
[09:01.520 --> 09:02.760]  We merge vehicles.
[09:02.980 --> 09:04.200]  We create a supercar.
[09:04.400 --> 09:04.700]  Ooh.
[09:04.920 --> 09:06.040]  Eight wheels of power.
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.080]  Wasn't that the plot of Mad Max?
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.080]  Was it?
[09:10.220 --> 09:10.700]  I don't know.
[09:11.640 --> 09:13.120]  That was just about a dude being mad.
[09:13.820 --> 09:14.720]  Yeah, pissed Max.
[09:16.300 --> 09:18.780]  Every sequel, he's just progressively angrier.
[09:18.880 --> 09:19.260]  Ah!
[09:19.520 --> 09:20.740]  Really mad Max.
[09:21.100 --> 09:22.220]  Really mad.
[09:23.660 --> 09:24.760]  Livid Max.
[09:24.960 --> 09:25.100]  Yeah.
[09:25.460 --> 09:25.920]  Ooh!
[09:25.920 --> 09:26.940]  The final.
[09:26.960 --> 09:27.600]  Oh, God.
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.640]  Gavin, that was awesome looking.
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.060]  God damn it.
[09:32.620 --> 09:33.540]  Machete and pots.
[09:33.920 --> 09:35.260]  Yeah, it's not looking good for us.
[09:35.400 --> 09:36.380]  Team Tape's falling apart.
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.840]  Oh, that's ironic, isn't it?
[09:39.040 --> 09:39.220]  Bah!
[09:42.080 --> 09:43.080]  Oh, nice shortcut.
[09:44.120 --> 09:46.100]  I think that's the tree that killed Gavin.
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.280]  Yeah, it was over his head.
[09:47.280 --> 09:48.140]  Oh, my God.
[09:48.140 --> 09:49.100]  Look at you guys.
[09:49.640 --> 09:50.620]  Yeah, we're flying, baby.
[09:51.200 --> 09:51.920]  Little roll.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.200]  Come on, all the way.
[09:53.320 --> 09:53.560]  All the way.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.980]  Hey, watch out for the river down there.
[09:54.980 --> 09:55.720]  Whoa!
[09:55.920 --> 09:56.480]  Oh, God.
[09:56.680 --> 09:57.300]  That was close.
[09:57.680 --> 09:58.480]  Did you go in the river?
[09:58.740 --> 09:59.740]  No, not this time.
[10:01.040 --> 10:01.900]  Just hit a tree.
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.840]  I see how you died.
[10:04.660 --> 10:04.820]  Yeah.
[10:05.240 --> 10:05.360]  Yeah.
[10:06.440 --> 10:07.380]  Bad tree, that one.
[10:07.680 --> 10:07.980]  Mm-hmm.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.260]  Shout out to whoever placed that.
[10:10.900 --> 10:11.460]  Oh, no!
[10:13.140 --> 10:13.560]  Shit.
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.480]  I'm really getting fucked up.
[10:17.700 --> 10:18.160]  Jesus Christ.
[10:18.160 --> 10:18.880]  By what?
[10:19.880 --> 10:20.720]  Just everything.
[10:20.920 --> 10:22.440]  Little plants, trees.
[10:22.660 --> 10:23.400]  Little plants.
[10:23.420 --> 10:24.560]  I'm getting fucked up by little plants.
[10:25.540 --> 10:26.360]  It's all hurting.
[10:26.420 --> 10:27.500]  I mean, this is the weed mission.
[10:29.800 --> 10:30.740]  And it's a little plant.
[10:31.140 --> 10:31.660]  Through the sky.
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.200]  Nice evasive maneuvers around Nick there.
[10:33.240 --> 10:33.540]  That's good.
[10:34.200 --> 10:34.500]  Hey, man.
[10:34.920 --> 10:36.420]  It's the only thing I've evaded.
[10:38.220 --> 10:39.340]  Hit every other rock.
[10:40.820 --> 10:41.040]  Oh.
[10:41.680 --> 10:42.120]  Oh!
[10:43.060 --> 10:45.480]  Oh, I just saw Andrew just start flipping around.
[10:46.700 --> 10:48.000]  Right into a tree.
[10:48.180 --> 10:50.920]  Like his arrow just went one way and then the other way.
[10:52.800 --> 10:53.740]  Nice way to overtake him.
[10:55.540 --> 10:56.020]  Shortcut.
[10:56.380 --> 10:56.860]  Goodbye.
[10:57.180 --> 10:58.340]  Holy shit.
[10:58.480 --> 10:58.700]  Fuck me.
[10:59.320 --> 10:59.860]  Oh, no.
[11:00.320 --> 11:00.980]  Did you make it?
[11:01.080 --> 11:02.380]  Oh, you just landed on him!
[11:02.700 --> 11:03.020]  Wow!
[11:04.900 --> 11:05.740]  That was cool.
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.880]  That was cool as shit.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.400]  Oh, you hit a rock.
[11:11.100 --> 11:11.480]  Oh!
[11:17.570 --> 11:18.370]  Oh, no.
[11:18.530 --> 11:19.070]  How you doing, Andrew?
[11:20.010 --> 11:21.230]  I'm in a creek.
[11:22.910 --> 11:24.330]  Getting out of a creek.
[11:26.090 --> 11:27.150]  Look out, Jackass!
[11:28.370 --> 11:29.130]  Oh.
[11:29.230 --> 11:30.150]  Oh!
[11:30.530 --> 11:30.990]  Alright.
[11:31.550 --> 11:32.050]  Oh!
[11:32.230 --> 11:32.610]  Oh!
[11:33.430 --> 11:35.550]  He's flipping us off all the way.
[11:37.610 --> 11:37.970]  Oh!
[11:38.150 --> 11:38.330]  Oh!
[11:38.530 --> 11:39.090]  Oh!
[11:39.210 --> 11:39.410]  Oh!
[11:39.410 --> 11:39.890]  Oh!
[11:39.890 --> 11:40.390]  Oh!
[11:40.390 --> 11:40.650]  Oh!
[11:41.470 --> 11:41.670]  Oh!
[11:45.470 --> 11:45.930]  Oh!
[11:46.930 --> 11:47.050]  Oh!
[11:52.410 --> 11:53.330]  Oh!
[11:53.410 --> 11:54.230]  Oh!
[11:54.750 --> 11:56.490]  I took that long.
[11:57.910 --> 11:58.590]  I should have shortcut.
[12:03.270 --> 12:03.990]  My car!
[12:11.830 --> 12:12.650]  Who pay him?
[12:12.750 --> 12:13.510]  The dick guys?
[12:16.170 --> 12:17.470]  Oh, I guess that is what it is, huh?
[12:17.830 --> 12:19.030]  It's probably up near the sawmill.
[12:22.210 --> 12:22.830]  Yeah, you can like...
[12:22.830 --> 12:24.210]  There's a mission in the...
[12:24.210 --> 12:27.970]  There's a story mode where you can like take hitchhikers and stuff to them.
[12:28.250 --> 12:28.330]  Oh, yeah.
[12:28.410 --> 12:28.770]  Yeah.
[12:29.350 --> 12:30.330]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[12:30.610 --> 12:31.130]  Oh, Gavin.
[12:31.390 --> 12:31.970]  Oh, Gavin.
[12:32.470 --> 12:33.730]  Get up the hill!
[12:33.930 --> 12:34.690]  Skyrim it, fool!
[12:36.830 --> 12:37.550]  Okay, we're here.
[12:37.610 --> 12:37.850]  Now what?
[12:38.990 --> 12:39.910]  Wait for us, please.
[12:40.010 --> 12:40.450]  Mask's on.
[12:42.030 --> 12:42.470]  Finally!
[12:45.650 --> 12:46.410]  Oh, it's...
[12:46.410 --> 12:49.010]  I forgot it's the paper bags and not the rat mask.
[12:49.470 --> 12:49.730]  No!
[12:50.550 --> 12:53.310]  The car I was gonna steal drove off the road.
[12:54.210 --> 12:55.530]  Go to the lookout position.
[12:56.510 --> 12:57.130]  We're getting into position.
[12:57.130 --> 12:57.550]  We're almost there!
[13:00.710 --> 13:01.070]  Um...
[13:01.070 --> 13:02.330]  We're creeping. This is cool.
[13:03.830 --> 13:05.050]  Yeah, I don't want to draw too much attention.
[13:05.210 --> 13:05.490]  Nuh-uh.
[13:07.370 --> 13:08.370]  Yep, I agree.
[13:15.410 --> 13:17.110]  Wait for the lookouts to get into position.
[13:17.250 --> 13:17.430]  Yep.
[13:17.710 --> 13:18.010]  Alright.
[13:19.390 --> 13:22.210]  Gavin said we don't want to draw too much attention. He has a rocket launcher?
[13:22.990 --> 13:23.210]  Yep.
[13:23.690 --> 13:24.930]  Yeah, but he hasn't fired it yet, has he?
[13:25.490 --> 13:25.950]  That's true.
[13:26.310 --> 13:27.450]  Hey, he's waiting for you guys.
[13:27.750 --> 13:28.350]  Yeah, well...
[13:28.970 --> 13:30.010]  I'm almost there.
[13:30.110 --> 13:30.890]  I hit a traffic jam.
[13:33.510 --> 13:34.310]  I'm in position.
[13:34.490 --> 13:34.710]  Okay!
[13:34.710 --> 13:36.170]  I got a real itchy RPG finger.
[13:36.590 --> 13:36.850]  Yeah.
[13:37.530 --> 13:38.130]  I can tell.
[13:38.450 --> 13:40.010]  I'm really sorry, fellas. I'm almost there.
[13:40.970 --> 13:41.630]  Can I see you?
[13:42.710 --> 13:43.910]  I can't see you guys.
[13:45.310 --> 13:45.730]  What kind of...
[13:45.730 --> 13:46.630]  Oh, wait, no. There you are!
[13:46.990 --> 13:47.490]  I see ya!
[13:47.910 --> 13:50.450]  Are we stealing this pickup with a gun on the back?
[13:50.570 --> 13:52.010]  I don't know what we're about to do.
[13:52.150 --> 13:52.630]  I think so.
[13:52.650 --> 13:53.430]  I think we should get in that.
[13:54.170 --> 13:55.230]  It's got a gun on it.
[13:55.770 --> 13:56.470]  Is that Nick?
[13:56.730 --> 13:57.590]  It has to be Nick.
[13:57.830 --> 13:57.990]  Let's see!
[13:58.550 --> 13:59.090]  Heal the Bensons?
[13:59.350 --> 13:59.950]  Oh, my God.
[14:00.010 --> 14:00.390]  Let's go!
[14:01.330 --> 14:01.750]  Okay.
[14:04.170 --> 14:05.630]  There are so many guys.
[14:06.430 --> 14:08.830]  Well, when we're on this Benson, we'll be unstoppable.
[14:10.230 --> 14:11.650]  I don't think that's a Benson, dude.
[14:12.250 --> 14:14.550]  Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[14:17.830 --> 14:19.290]  What happened? What happened?
[14:19.810 --> 14:20.410]  Gavin's dead.
[14:21.890 --> 14:23.790]  When I'm on the Benson, I'm being unstoppable!
[14:24.230 --> 14:26.190]  That's not the thing that we were trying to get.
[14:26.690 --> 14:30.790]  No, I ran up to it. I ran up to the turret car, and the door was locked, and I died on it.
[14:30.890 --> 14:33.590]  Oh, I'd be so happy if it makes us drive all the way there.
[14:34.650 --> 14:35.550]  That would be so funny.
[14:35.730 --> 14:35.990]  Oh, please.
[14:35.990 --> 14:36.250]  Surely not.
[14:36.490 --> 14:37.230]  Please don't.
[14:38.330 --> 14:38.810]  Oh, no.
[14:39.970 --> 14:40.410]  Zoom in.
[14:40.710 --> 14:41.310]  Zoom in.
[14:41.530 --> 14:42.450]  Just go straight back down.
[14:42.550 --> 14:43.630]  Move camera back. Back, back, back.
[14:43.630 --> 14:44.250]  Straight back down.
[14:44.490 --> 14:45.350]  All the way back to the city.
[14:45.470 --> 14:46.250]  Back to the start.
[14:46.250 --> 14:47.150]  No, because they won't like me.
[14:47.350 --> 14:47.690]  No.
[14:48.530 --> 14:48.870]  Please.
[14:49.290 --> 14:50.310]  Oh, God, it's just hovering.
[14:50.850 --> 14:51.050]  Yes!
[14:52.210 --> 14:53.030]  Ah, damn it.
[14:58.130 --> 14:59.690]  Nick hasn't got a mask on.
[14:59.750 --> 14:59.930]  Yeah.
[15:00.510 --> 15:01.430]  Yeah, he doesn't care.
[15:01.890 --> 15:04.790]  No, I was in the river when the prompt came up.
[15:08.710 --> 15:09.770]  I got it now.
[15:10.030 --> 15:11.010]  Going to the lookout.
[15:12.170 --> 15:14.110]  I thought Gavin was holding a chainsaw for a second.
[15:15.670 --> 15:16.230]  Holding a what?
[15:16.490 --> 15:17.410]  A chainsaw.
[15:17.690 --> 15:19.110]  Do you guys have sniper rifles?
[15:20.010 --> 15:20.410]  Yeah, I do.
[15:20.650 --> 15:21.370]  I was sniping.
[15:22.290 --> 15:24.090]  If you could, yeah, snipe, that'd be great.
[15:24.250 --> 15:24.790]  Use them, yeah.
[15:24.830 --> 15:25.370]  I was sniping.
[15:25.950 --> 15:27.730]  Everything was going great until...
[15:27.730 --> 15:28.950]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[15:30.050 --> 15:31.830]  That's usually how it goes in life.
[15:34.610 --> 15:36.830]  I don't think I've ever said ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[15:36.830 --> 15:37.810]  Okay, steal the Benson's.
[15:37.830 --> 15:38.290]  We'll actually get hurt.
[15:38.330 --> 15:38.870]  Let's do it.
[15:39.730 --> 15:41.990]  Well, a lot of deaths are just one big ow.
[15:42.410 --> 15:43.050]  Not a bunch.
[15:43.150 --> 15:43.470]  That's true.
[15:44.050 --> 15:44.770]  Plane crash.
[15:44.870 --> 15:45.310]  The big ow.
[15:45.330 --> 15:46.030]  Probably just the one.
[15:51.570 --> 15:52.170]  I got you.
[15:52.370 --> 15:53.210]  One shot, one kill.
[15:53.650 --> 15:54.110]  Oh, shit.
[15:54.210 --> 15:55.850]  No, actually it's...
[15:55.850 --> 15:56.390]  Two shots.
[15:56.390 --> 15:58.710]  Wow, that guy is taking a lot of bullets down there.
[16:01.230 --> 16:01.670]  Oh.
[16:03.210 --> 16:03.790]  What's up?
[16:04.610 --> 16:06.210]  I was just zoomed in on someone and they fell.
[16:06.870 --> 16:08.830]  Oh, right in the cranio.
[16:08.930 --> 16:09.930]  Is he still alive?
[16:10.850 --> 16:12.410]  How is this guy still alive?
[16:13.810 --> 16:15.330]  Is this the one where Lamar shows up?
[16:15.730 --> 16:16.590]  Or is that in the campaign?
[16:17.310 --> 16:18.650]  I think that's the campaign.
[16:19.210 --> 16:20.210]  But I could be wrong.
[16:22.950 --> 16:23.670]  Oh, missed.
[16:24.290 --> 16:24.970]  Not that time.
[16:27.610 --> 16:28.210]  Still locked.
[16:32.030 --> 16:33.350]  I don't see anybody else.
[16:33.910 --> 16:35.730]  There's a guy up here.
[16:37.030 --> 16:37.930]  I think I can get him.
[16:37.950 --> 16:40.070]  There's a guy near on my side, but I don't have an angle.
[16:40.770 --> 16:41.670]  Yeah, there's more.
[16:45.290 --> 16:46.630]  Alright, two of us are getting in vans.
[16:46.710 --> 16:47.550]  Two of us are getting in the pickup.
[16:49.670 --> 16:51.390]  Okay, we gotta start moving down there.
[16:52.530 --> 16:53.290]  Okay, let's go.
[17:01.270 --> 17:01.830]  Still locked.
[17:02.910 --> 17:04.430]  Well, that's because you're not getting in that.
[17:04.530 --> 17:05.890]  You're getting in the...
[17:05.890 --> 17:07.750]  No, I just wanted to get over there with it.
[17:10.590 --> 17:11.970]  Okay, I got one of these things.
[17:15.330 --> 17:16.850]  Wait for your team to steal a Benson.
[17:18.370 --> 17:19.390]  Apologies, I'm just killing a man.
[17:19.450 --> 17:20.170]  I'm gonna Benson up.
[17:20.510 --> 17:21.950]  Oh, I'm supposed to steal the technical.
[17:22.970 --> 17:24.790]  Yeah, I got a technical prompt.
[17:25.370 --> 17:26.110]  I'm coming to you.
[17:26.670 --> 17:27.770]  Oh, so it wasn't locked for you?
[17:28.130 --> 17:28.370]  No.
[17:30.050 --> 17:32.070]  Wait for your team to reach the technical.
[17:32.670 --> 17:34.330]  Are you guys doing this or what?
[17:34.670 --> 17:35.490]  I'm waiting on Andrew.
[17:36.550 --> 17:39.590]  I gotta get to Andrew. Can you let me go past you? Thank you.
[17:40.050 --> 17:40.610]  I opened the gate.
[17:40.710 --> 17:41.530]  Why is... what?
[17:42.470 --> 17:43.230]  Here you go, hop on.
[17:44.870 --> 17:46.090]  Alright, Gavin, let's go.
[17:47.990 --> 17:49.550]  Come on, got it.
[17:50.030 --> 17:51.570]  I don't know. There you go.
[17:53.210 --> 17:53.870]  Let's go.
[17:56.650 --> 17:57.570]  Wants me to go on this?
[17:57.710 --> 17:58.590]  Now we gotta escort them.
[17:58.730 --> 17:59.890]  We can cover your retreat.
[18:00.630 --> 18:03.490]  If you two could both go on the same roads, that'd be great.
[18:03.690 --> 18:03.810]  Yeah.
[18:04.290 --> 18:05.250]  We'll let Eric go.
[18:09.280 --> 18:11.160]  Alright, let's regroup on the main road.
[18:11.400 --> 18:11.600]  Yeah.
[18:14.940 --> 18:19.140]  Alright, are you going through the tunnel?
[18:19.800 --> 18:20.520]  Yeah, I think so.
[18:21.120 --> 18:21.940]  We're not there yet though.
[18:23.600 --> 18:24.720]  We're still going up the hill.
[18:24.720 --> 18:26.080]  You okay?
[18:26.800 --> 18:28.280]  Yeah, the turning is rough.
[18:29.600 --> 18:31.260]  Especially on this.
[18:31.720 --> 18:32.020]  Oh, yeah.
[18:33.540 --> 18:34.460]  Terrible terrain.
[18:35.860 --> 18:39.300]  It also goes way faster than you think it's going to.
[18:39.700 --> 18:39.980]  Oh, yeah.
[18:40.620 --> 18:41.680]  Alright, Gavin, let's do it.
[18:42.020 --> 18:43.080]  Let's do it.
[18:43.220 --> 18:45.280]  Should we hold back or take the lead?
[18:46.420 --> 18:47.360]  Probably lead.
[18:48.740 --> 18:49.720]  Pass on the right.
[18:49.800 --> 18:50.760]  Oh, Nick!
[18:51.340 --> 18:52.100]  Look at that.
[18:53.340 --> 18:54.580]  Now, pass on the right.
[18:55.040 --> 18:57.040]  What is that? Why are you saying pass on the right?
[18:58.440 --> 19:00.360]  I moved them to the left so they could pass on the right.
[19:00.560 --> 19:01.420]  No, I understand.
[19:03.380 --> 19:04.100]  Oh, thanks!
[19:04.320 --> 19:06.540]  We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[19:06.660 --> 19:08.400]  We're okay, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[19:08.540 --> 19:10.220]  I don't like that, Gavin!
[19:11.020 --> 19:11.340]  Gavin!
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.180]  We're good.
[19:14.960 --> 19:15.600]  We're fine.
[19:15.920 --> 19:17.420]  Hey, what's up, fellas?
[19:18.540 --> 19:19.720]  Well, we had some trouble.
[19:20.280 --> 19:20.720]  Uh-huh.
[19:20.900 --> 19:21.760]  But we're okay now.
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.780]  And you're protecting us, right?
[19:24.900 --> 19:27.760]  Well, see, here's the thing. It's hard to protect those that want to kill you.
[19:28.700 --> 19:28.880]  Uh-huh.
[19:29.020 --> 19:30.340]  And Gavin definitely wanted to kill us.
[19:30.960 --> 19:32.280]  Well, I was just flooring it.
[19:34.300 --> 19:35.460]  Gavin's just trying to beat the mission, you know?
[19:36.820 --> 19:37.860]  Who was passing on the right?
[19:37.860 --> 19:38.640]  Oh, I gotta kill these guys.
[19:39.040 --> 19:41.620]  No, you know what, Gavin? You bypassed some of the enemies. You did great.
[19:42.100 --> 19:43.680]  Well, Gavin, the left is passing.
[19:43.680 --> 19:44.540]  You pass on the left.
[19:44.540 --> 19:46.780]  No, I was on the left.
[19:48.880 --> 19:50.940]  Well, I was in the middle.
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.500]  And that's why I hate London.
[19:54.700 --> 19:54.740]  Gavin!
[19:55.400 --> 19:57.040]  And then I just moved to the left.
[19:57.240 --> 19:58.020]  Uh-huh, yes.
[19:58.300 --> 20:02.500]  You are describing why I hate London.
[20:04.620 --> 20:05.560]  Oh, my God.
[20:05.700 --> 20:07.380]  Almost into the river with those two, huh?
[20:08.040 --> 20:12.700]  Are you saying you want me to abide by the real-world rules in GTA?
[20:12.700 --> 20:15.000]  Well, it makes sense with passing.
[20:16.700 --> 20:17.560]  It just makes sense.
[20:18.100 --> 20:20.440]  We drive constantly on the wrong side of the road in this game.
[20:20.860 --> 20:21.960]  In the middle, guys. Go.
[20:22.320 --> 20:22.680]  Yeah!
[20:23.340 --> 20:27.000]  I would like to help, but Gavin keeps going ahead without his defenders.
[20:27.020 --> 20:28.080]  Oh, just get ahead of me.
[20:31.460 --> 20:32.460]  Hey, pass on the left.
[20:32.940 --> 20:33.260]  See?
[20:34.520 --> 20:39.520]  Oh, that was just a guy.
[20:39.520 --> 20:40.040]  Yeah, it was just a person.
[20:40.240 --> 20:41.120]  Oh, you guys are just...
[20:41.120 --> 20:42.080]  You guys...
[20:46.640 --> 20:48.340]  I'm about to fucking die.
[20:49.040 --> 20:49.440]  Whoa!
[20:50.760 --> 20:53.220]  Straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead.
[20:53.860 --> 20:55.100]  I'm turning, I'm turning.
[20:57.500 --> 21:00.040]  I really appreciate that the enemies all have lime...
[21:00.040 --> 21:00.540]  Oh, never mind.
[21:00.900 --> 21:01.880]  Yeah, lime green.
[21:02.620 --> 21:04.060]  We got one straight ahead, by the way.
[21:07.080 --> 21:07.700]  Oh, dear.
[21:09.820 --> 21:10.980]  I'm catching up, fellas.
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.100]  You don't seem to be killing a lot of people.
[21:14.260 --> 21:16.320]  You just sort of crash it into them and then leaving.
[21:16.780 --> 21:17.940]  Well, I don't have a gun.
[21:20.000 --> 21:20.700]  Well, that was a good kill.
[21:20.860 --> 21:21.440]  I don't have a driver.
[21:23.020 --> 21:23.260]  Oh, wait.
[21:23.420 --> 21:25.640]  Oh, did I run someone over? Oh, I think I did.
[21:26.080 --> 21:26.740]  Straight ahead.
[21:31.260 --> 21:31.800]  Excuse me.
[21:34.020 --> 21:34.380]  Fuck!
[21:36.200 --> 21:36.680]  Nick died.
[21:37.100 --> 21:37.340]  Yep.
[21:39.600 --> 21:41.460]  I don't understand how that happened.
[21:41.460 --> 21:44.400]  I got spun out, and when we got hit, I died instantly.
[21:45.260 --> 21:46.820]  You just died in a car accident?
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  I died in a car accident.
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.340]  Where's that checkpoint going to be?
[21:55.380 --> 21:56.700]  Probably at the vehicles, right?
[21:59.060 --> 22:01.000]  Oh, boy.
[22:01.760 --> 22:03.240]  Alright, we'll just lead the way this time.
[22:06.620 --> 22:08.140]  Alright, what do you want us to do, game?
[22:09.900 --> 22:10.900]  Be the same thing, right?
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.200]  You guys take the technical, we take the Bensons, and that's it.
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.220]  Unless it wants us to do Overwatch again.
[22:16.640 --> 22:17.920]  It wants you to do Overwatch?
[22:17.920 --> 22:18.140]  No, I don't want to do that.
[22:18.920 --> 22:20.140]  We were lookouts.
[22:21.340 --> 22:24.200]  Oh, I thought you meant, like, the game.
[22:24.640 --> 22:25.260]  No, fuck no.
[22:25.280 --> 22:28.660]  Does the game always have this conveyor turned on?
[22:28.680 --> 22:29.480]  That looks cool.
[22:29.740 --> 22:30.760]  Yeah, it does look cool.
[22:31.280 --> 22:33.380]  I got the higher one, Gavin, if you want to take that lower one.
[22:33.440 --> 22:35.360]  It's giving us a different route back, for some reason.
[22:35.760 --> 22:37.020]  You take the higher route, I'll take the lower?
[22:37.340 --> 22:39.060]  Yeah, we'll get there together.
[22:39.760 --> 22:42.000]  Alright, this is leading us this way, if you guys want to come this way.
[22:42.960 --> 22:43.760]  Oh, really?
[22:44.120 --> 22:45.540]  Because my waypoint is not...
[22:45.540 --> 22:47.580]  Yeah, mine either. I'm following Nick, though.
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.080]  Go ahead, dude. I'm following you.
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.260]  I'm waiting on Gavin to make sure he's following us.
[22:52.420 --> 22:53.820]  It's wrong on my screen, but sure.
[22:53.860 --> 22:55.620]  Yeah, mine too. I'm excited to see it.
[22:56.240 --> 23:00.500]  Oh, he just added a mile to our trip.
[23:00.580 --> 23:00.900]  No way.
[23:01.360 --> 23:03.520]  This went way faster.
[23:03.940 --> 23:04.440]  Oh, boy.
[23:06.540 --> 23:08.760]  We're on the road fast.
[23:09.640 --> 23:11.140]  We don't actually want to be on the road.
[23:11.660 --> 23:12.080]  Wow.
[23:12.340 --> 23:13.820]  That's where the cars are.
[23:13.960 --> 23:15.580]  See, Gavin, you passed on the left. It makes sense, right?
[23:18.540 --> 23:20.020]  What was that, Nick?
[23:20.580 --> 23:22.720]  It's Gavin coming right for you.
[23:23.100 --> 23:24.560]  Yeah, it's Gavin coming right for you.
[23:24.660 --> 23:25.420]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[23:25.480 --> 23:27.480]  From my perspective, I didn't see anything.
[23:27.800 --> 23:28.520]  Oh, let me tell you.
[23:29.760 --> 23:31.860]  Gavin is just barreling down.
[23:32.780 --> 23:35.220]  It's Gavin versus the world in this thing.
[23:36.460 --> 23:38.640]  How are we so slow right now?
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.440]  I don't know. We're fast.
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.820]  These Bensons are quick.
[23:45.760 --> 23:47.580]  It doesn't really feel like we're necessary.
[23:48.460 --> 23:49.920]  I think you will be eventually.
[23:52.700 --> 23:53.900]  I'd rather have the Karuma.
[23:54.340 --> 23:56.420]  Do you think the enemies are like, where the fuck are they?
[23:56.460 --> 23:57.800]  Yeah. Oh, Gavin.
[23:58.660 --> 23:59.220]  Oh, Gavin.
[23:59.940 --> 24:01.120]  That just snapped.
[24:02.140 --> 24:03.800]  I don't know what happened to him, but everyone's crashing.
[24:04.220 --> 24:05.760]  Yeah, everyone.
[24:07.780 --> 24:09.520]  Well, there were a bunch of dumps that crashed.
[24:09.520 --> 24:12.720]  Did you say dumps or dumbs?
[24:13.480 --> 24:13.800]  Dumps.
[24:14.380 --> 24:15.480]  Like dump truck.
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.160]  Oh, should we go into the military base?
[24:18.960 --> 24:19.280]  No.
[24:19.640 --> 24:19.760]  Oh.
[24:28.770 --> 24:30.390]  There they are.
[24:31.150 --> 24:32.070]  Open up.
[24:33.590 --> 24:34.270]  Hi, enemies.
[24:39.400 --> 24:39.900]  Oh, no.
[24:40.260 --> 24:40.400]  Nick!
[24:40.800 --> 24:41.440]  Nick!
[24:41.440 --> 24:42.760]  Cars trapped me.
[24:48.240 --> 24:49.560]  Yeah, me and you, Gavin. You're good.
[24:50.520 --> 24:50.960]  Nice shooting.
[24:51.840 --> 24:52.700]  I'm on your right.
[24:55.380 --> 24:56.400]  Great big convoy.
[24:56.540 --> 24:58.100]  You're passing on one side?
[24:58.140 --> 24:59.680]  No, it's just because you were going too slow.
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.700]  You don't want to pass on the right. It's not good.
[25:04.120 --> 25:04.980]  Oh, we missed our turn.
[25:05.640 --> 25:06.400]  I missed my turn.
[25:08.760 --> 25:10.200]  Wait, now it's going straight?
[25:10.920 --> 25:11.780]  No, go the other way.
[25:11.780 --> 25:12.960]  Go up the hill.
[25:13.980 --> 25:15.260]  We'll cover you.
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.240]  Remind me to buy more armor when this is over.
[25:25.400 --> 25:27.920]  Ah, you lime green fucks.
[25:29.260 --> 25:30.420]  There's some lime greens up here.
[25:31.100 --> 25:31.660]  I'll get you.
[25:33.480 --> 25:35.020]  Oh, you got a lot of lime on you.
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.460]  A lot of lime.
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.580]  Too many limes.
[25:45.710 --> 25:47.070]  Alright, we're rocking this time.
[25:50.350 --> 25:51.650]  Gavin's flying up there.
[25:51.990 --> 25:53.550]  Oh my god, Gavin!
[25:54.950 --> 25:57.110]  Has there ever been a Dr. Pepper lime?
[25:57.750 --> 25:59.510]  Uh, I don't think so.
[26:01.130 --> 26:02.350]  Feels like that should exist.
[26:02.570 --> 26:04.110]  I had lime too late in life.
[26:04.350 --> 26:05.090]  It's ruined for me.
[26:05.470 --> 26:07.770]  It just reminds me of Corona.
[26:08.150 --> 26:09.770]  I just taste Corona when I have a lime.
[26:09.890 --> 26:10.530]  Oh yeah, I see.
[26:12.530 --> 26:13.930]  I'll drink that all day.
[26:14.330 --> 26:14.830]  Yeah, me too.
[26:15.310 --> 26:17.610]  So like a key lime pie is a Corona pie to you?
[26:17.610 --> 26:19.110]  Corona pie.
[26:19.690 --> 26:22.090]  Oh man, were we eating fucking Corona pies?
[26:25.830 --> 26:28.230]  Hey, where do you think our coverage is?
[26:28.270 --> 26:29.570]  Because I'm getting shot and I'm going to die.
[26:30.150 --> 26:32.010]  Yeah, where's this car with a gun on it?
[26:32.390 --> 26:32.670]  Wow.
[26:34.850 --> 26:36.750]  I got surrounded by two lime cars
[26:36.750 --> 26:37.850]  because no one was covering me
[26:37.850 --> 26:38.310]  and I died.
[26:38.730 --> 26:40.710]  Well, we were getting rid of the ones behind us.
[26:41.010 --> 26:42.190]  Oh, okay.
[26:42.950 --> 26:45.170]  Were you worried about the ones behind you, Gavin?
[26:45.170 --> 26:45.710]  No.
[26:47.090 --> 26:49.370]  But you can also just leave your food window open
[26:49.370 --> 26:50.410]  and just eat food.
[26:52.450 --> 26:53.550]  Oh, you're saying like
[26:53.550 --> 26:54.330]  hold... oh.
[26:55.270 --> 26:56.230]  No, you don't have to hold it.
[26:56.390 --> 26:58.330]  No, no, no, I'm saying to open it
[26:58.330 --> 26:59.550]  because you're not doing anything.
[27:01.630 --> 27:02.630]  It's only D-pad.
[27:03.030 --> 27:05.830]  Alright, so for this third and final round
[27:06.890 --> 27:07.870]  do we want to take
[27:07.870 --> 27:08.830]  the high road or the low road?
[27:09.610 --> 27:10.730]  The fastest road.
[27:12.370 --> 27:13.670]  I don't know which of the two
[27:13.670 --> 27:14.110]  is faster.
[27:14.690 --> 27:15.990]  I assume the first line.
[27:16.410 --> 27:18.330]  I can drive this time, Nick, and you can enjoy the turret.
[27:19.370 --> 27:20.410]  It's a lot more fun.
[27:21.210 --> 27:22.590]  Hold on, hold on.
[27:24.430 --> 27:24.830]  Get...
[27:24.830 --> 27:26.150]  What the fuck?
[27:27.450 --> 27:29.590]  Get on the thing, dumbass.
[27:31.050 --> 27:31.630]  Alright, let's go.
[27:32.310 --> 27:33.350]  Okay, I'm gonna follow Nick.
[27:33.470 --> 27:34.270]  Or Andrew, I guess.
[27:36.490 --> 27:36.870]  Oh, okay.
[27:36.970 --> 27:38.250]  Is that the way you went?
[27:39.250 --> 27:40.230]  That's the waypoint.
[27:40.230 --> 27:41.410]  Taking the high road this time.
[27:42.450 --> 27:44.130]  Oh, Gavin, what are you doing?
[27:44.810 --> 27:46.090]  I thought you were gonna...
[27:46.090 --> 27:48.310]  I was making the turn
[27:48.310 --> 27:50.450]  and then you went, and me too.
[27:52.530 --> 27:53.810]  I went for a handbrake turn.
[27:54.170 --> 27:56.290]  I like it. It's for style.
[27:56.930 --> 27:57.810]  Whatever it takes, man.
[27:58.970 --> 27:59.890]  Was that a handbrake turn?
[28:02.930 --> 28:04.730]  I'm just asking. I'm just asking for a friend.
[28:05.010 --> 28:05.550]  Was that a handbrake turn?
[28:06.930 --> 28:08.130]  I'll talk to your friend directly.
[28:11.850 --> 28:12.730]  Alright, we got people
[28:12.730 --> 28:13.930]  at the bottom of this hill, I remember.
[28:15.110 --> 28:16.210]  They should be here.
[28:16.330 --> 28:17.930]  No, they're down there. I see them.
[28:18.210 --> 28:19.670]  Start unloading here in a second.
[28:22.430 --> 28:22.830]  Nice.
[28:23.790 --> 28:24.310]  Thank you.
[28:24.650 --> 28:25.390]  Alright, dead.
[28:26.210 --> 28:28.510]  I'm going slow over this bridge. Please don't run into me, Gavin.
[28:30.390 --> 28:30.610]  Oh.
[28:32.250 --> 28:33.170]  Ooh, real slow.
[28:33.290 --> 28:33.350]  They're all dead.
[28:34.210 --> 28:36.530]  I'm just trying to negotiate this here.
[28:37.150 --> 28:37.470]  Okay.
[28:37.470 --> 28:39.810]  I'm not trying to fly down and end up sideways.
[28:40.230 --> 28:41.390]  I'll see you down there.
[28:41.510 --> 28:43.090]  Cool. Sounds good.
[28:45.290 --> 28:45.730]  Dead.
[28:46.950 --> 28:47.390]  Nice.
[28:52.930 --> 28:53.810]  Let's see.
[28:54.030 --> 28:54.230]  Ah.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.840]  Round three. Fight.
[28:59.400 --> 28:59.840]  Thank you.
[29:02.720 --> 29:03.980]  Oh, there's a guy right there.
[29:04.000 --> 29:04.960]  Gavin, did you see me down there?
[29:06.120 --> 29:07.380]  I went a bit far down.
[29:07.860 --> 29:08.560]  Blow up!
[29:09.900 --> 29:10.780]  Jesus Christ!
[29:10.920 --> 29:11.960]  What is with this car?
[29:12.360 --> 29:13.240]  Alright, keep going. We're alright.
[29:15.560 --> 29:16.220]  Okay, there we go.
[29:16.280 --> 29:18.160]  I'm catching up to you two right now.
[29:19.500 --> 29:20.120]  I'm not.
[29:20.660 --> 29:21.400]  Yeah, Gavin's not.
[29:21.760 --> 29:23.300]  Oh yeah, now Gavin holds back.
[29:24.360 --> 29:25.380]  That's not what's happening.
[29:25.620 --> 29:27.420]  Instead of spinning out the lead car.
[29:27.760 --> 29:29.160]  Yeah, that's not what he's doing.
[29:30.200 --> 29:31.780]  He's not holding anything back.
[29:41.160 --> 29:42.180]  I guess I'll wait.
[29:44.820 --> 29:45.700]  Probably a good idea.
[29:45.940 --> 29:46.860]  Oh, well.
[29:50.040 --> 29:50.960]  He's up ahead.
[29:54.000 --> 29:54.960]  Well, you know.
[29:55.520 --> 29:57.160]  No time like the present, I suppose.
[30:02.500 --> 30:04.200]  Oh my god, Gavin!
[30:06.540 --> 30:07.720]  That was pretty cool.
[30:07.720 --> 30:08.940]  That was pretty cool.
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.680]  Jesus! Oh, Nick!
[30:12.020 --> 30:12.900]  Well, don't be right there.
[30:13.140 --> 30:13.980]  Why'd you scream Nick?
[30:16.960 --> 30:18.840]  I'm not the one driving this time!
[30:20.540 --> 30:20.940]  Nick!
[30:24.380 --> 30:25.380]  Alright, Gavin, I'm with you.
[30:26.240 --> 30:27.840]  What do you think this guy's gonna do when I hit him?
[30:28.020 --> 30:29.020]  I guess we're gonna find out.
[30:31.660 --> 30:32.060]  Squish!
[30:32.860 --> 30:34.060]  Oh, you didn't follow up.
[30:34.560 --> 30:35.100]  I tried.
[30:35.100 --> 30:37.360]  He shot off to the left.
[30:37.620 --> 30:38.080]  Mmm.
[30:39.080 --> 30:40.020]  Good speed.
[30:41.800 --> 30:42.280]  Whoa!
[30:49.420 --> 30:50.240]  Sandwich attack!
[30:50.800 --> 30:51.900]  Oh my god!
[30:53.420 --> 30:54.900]  Nick doesn't know what to shoot.
[30:55.020 --> 30:56.760]  There's so many rigid targets!
[31:00.040 --> 31:02.060]  Oh god, as soon as we slow down, it's a problem.
[31:02.160 --> 31:03.240]  They group up real quick.
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.080]  Come on, Eric!
[31:05.860 --> 31:07.140]  Why did my car get so slow?
[31:07.140 --> 31:14.420]  Okay, I'm in front.
[31:14.800 --> 31:15.740]  Okay, one sec.
[31:19.650 --> 31:20.630]  Okay, hello.
[31:23.230 --> 31:23.750]  Done.
[31:26.930 --> 31:27.410]  Gah!
[31:27.910 --> 31:29.590]  Shit, that civilian vehicle!
[31:30.430 --> 31:31.350]  Where's the gun car?
[31:31.870 --> 31:32.890]  We're back here!
[31:33.630 --> 31:34.630]  We've been fucking ganged up on!
[31:34.630 --> 31:36.870]  They're protecting us from those cars behind us again, remember?
[31:37.050 --> 31:40.450]  Hey, you know that this thing has the ability of a squirrel?
[31:40.870 --> 31:42.570]  It's so shitty
[31:42.570 --> 31:43.890]  when we get hit by something.
[31:44.990 --> 31:45.350]  Don't do that.
[31:47.490 --> 31:47.850]  Okay.
[31:48.370 --> 31:49.210]  Why don't you put it that way?
[31:50.650 --> 31:51.690]  It's actually great advice.
[31:53.710 --> 31:54.430]  I'm sorry.
[31:55.730 --> 31:56.310]  That's on us.
[31:57.290 --> 31:58.570]  I got a line right up my ass.
[31:59.150 --> 32:00.410]  I got one right in front of me.
[32:00.930 --> 32:02.090]  Don't worry, I took care of him.
[32:02.930 --> 32:03.570]  Oh yeah, you did.
[32:04.850 --> 32:06.410]  I got to do it.
[32:08.070 --> 32:09.050]  We're almost there!
[32:09.650 --> 32:11.030]  Pretty big talk from guys who keep
[32:11.030 --> 32:11.870]  Leaving their
[32:12.970 --> 32:14.170]  Support line.
[32:14.370 --> 32:15.570]  We're leaving.
[32:16.710 --> 32:18.230]  You were faster than us.
[32:18.510 --> 32:20.010]  You were faster than this vehicle.
[32:20.410 --> 32:21.710]  Whoa, Gavin!
[32:22.270 --> 32:22.570]  Hello!
[32:23.710 --> 32:28.170]  Oh, make this jump!
[32:29.230 --> 32:29.870]  AAAAAAH!
[32:31.610 --> 32:33.430]  Keith's snack screen up advice
[32:33.430 --> 32:33.990]  was really good.
[32:35.230 --> 32:38.230]  It's not good if you need to handbrake.
[32:38.650 --> 32:39.690]  No, no, no.
[32:40.170 --> 32:43.110]  You just have to take it a little slower.
[32:43.930 --> 32:45.050]  We're almost there!
[32:45.690 --> 32:46.130]  Oh, Gavin.
[32:48.590 --> 32:51.130]  I just realized we have a time limit on the bottom right.
[32:51.750 --> 32:52.250]  Oh, we do!
[32:52.350 --> 32:53.250]  Oh, you didn't realize?
[32:53.570 --> 32:53.850]  No.
[32:53.950 --> 32:54.930]  Why do you think I'm holding off?
[32:55.910 --> 32:56.250]  What?
[32:56.310 --> 32:57.390]  I had no idea.
[32:57.690 --> 32:58.930]  I didn't even notice that one.
[33:01.410 --> 33:03.830]  Dear God, your truck has seen better days.
[33:04.790 --> 33:06.190]  Gavin, take the split right.
[33:06.710 --> 33:08.210]  Follow me, so that way it's...
[33:08.210 --> 33:08.590]  There you go.
[33:09.690 --> 33:11.490]  We take it down here.
[33:12.270 --> 33:13.210]  Just like that!
[33:16.390 --> 33:17.830]  Wait for the team in the technical.
[33:18.190 --> 33:18.670]  Got it.
[33:19.430 --> 33:19.910]  We're here.
[33:20.430 --> 33:21.070]  Nick, no!
[33:21.310 --> 33:22.150]  I shot out their tires.
[33:22.450 --> 33:22.670]  Yeah!
[33:24.290 --> 33:24.770]  Oh.
[33:25.030 --> 33:25.310]  Wow!
[33:26.210 --> 33:27.590]  That's so much weed!
[33:28.190 --> 33:28.550]  That's a lot of weed.
[33:29.370 --> 33:32.310]  Not a bit of it moved on the drive. That's crazy.
[33:36.170 --> 33:37.890]  Look at how fucked up the truck is.
[33:37.890 --> 33:38.450]  It is...
[33:38.450 --> 33:38.830]  Yeah!
[33:38.830 --> 33:40.870]  I'm seeing it all crumpled up.
[33:41.090 --> 33:42.730]  I'm trying to like stand on it.
[33:42.990 --> 33:44.930]  And I'll get this unloaded.
[33:45.190 --> 33:45.930]  But unless...
[33:45.930 --> 33:46.990]  Well, it's heist time now.
[33:47.690 --> 33:49.030]  Yeah, are we doing the series again?
[33:49.030 --> 33:50.510]  Is it another video or is it this one?
[33:50.850 --> 33:51.350]  It's this one.
[33:51.430 --> 33:51.950]  I think it's this one.
[33:52.250 --> 33:53.310]  Hell yeah!
[33:54.570 --> 33:55.950]  Oh, this is it, baby.
[33:56.790 --> 33:57.730]  What is there left to do?
[33:59.370 --> 34:00.510]  Nothing, just the heist.
[34:01.790 --> 34:03.350]  Didn't we heist all the things already?
[34:04.090 --> 34:04.490]  Yeah.
[34:05.190 --> 34:07.770]  Yeah, but now it's, I guess, whatever we're doing with it.
[34:07.770 --> 34:09.050]  Maybe selling it?
[34:11.070 --> 34:12.830]  I don't know. I've never done this.
[34:14.310 --> 34:15.210]  Gavin, do you remember?
[34:16.050 --> 34:16.790]  There's no way.
[34:16.850 --> 34:17.370]  Gavin's gone.
[34:17.870 --> 34:19.030]  Oh, he's rolling around in the P.
[34:19.070 --> 34:19.490]  I don't remember.
[34:20.010 --> 34:20.610]  How's the piss?
[34:21.390 --> 34:24.230]  I was just grabbing lunch from the doorstep.
[34:24.970 --> 34:25.570]  Was it cat piss?
[34:25.670 --> 34:26.470]  Oh, what's for lunch?
[34:27.050 --> 34:28.050]  I went for a soup.
[34:29.010 --> 34:29.730]  Oh, what kind of soup?
[34:31.030 --> 34:32.310]  A little bit of a Tommy soup.
[34:33.370 --> 34:34.810]  What's a Tommy soup?
[34:35.890 --> 34:36.530]  Yeah, tomorrow.
[34:36.990 --> 34:37.750]  Oh, no.
[34:37.750 --> 34:38.150]  Oh.
[34:39.270 --> 34:40.450]  Hang on, Andrew, wait.
[34:41.650 --> 34:42.530]  Let's do a death proof.
[34:43.770 --> 34:44.450]  Death proof.
[34:45.330 --> 34:49.770]  Yeah, but the thing about the car is to get its full benefits, you gotta be in the seat.
[34:51.790 --> 34:53.050]  Oh, fuck, your seat.
[34:53.510 --> 34:54.030]  Oh, shit.
[34:54.030 --> 34:55.090]  Yeah, for some reason...
[34:55.090 --> 34:56.250]  Why did I build the car this way?
[34:56.450 --> 34:59.110]  For some reason, the passenger seat is death proof.
[34:59.250 --> 34:59.950]  Oh, fuck.
[35:00.110 --> 35:01.250]  This car sucks.
[35:01.290 --> 35:02.070]  Oh, shit.
[35:05.510 --> 35:07.730]  Oh, hey, can we dip into ammunition real quick?
[35:07.730 --> 35:09.250]  I'm going there right now.
[35:09.590 --> 35:11.890]  Uh, I need to buy like a bunch of armors and stuff.
[35:12.490 --> 35:13.310]  You could do that from the menu.
[35:16.070 --> 35:16.430]  What?
[35:16.790 --> 35:17.110]  What?
[35:17.450 --> 35:17.810]  What?
[35:18.370 --> 35:19.370]  What are you talking about?
[35:19.390 --> 35:20.410]  When you go to like health and ammo?
[35:21.930 --> 35:23.670]  No, like when in the lobby menu.
[35:24.270 --> 35:26.510]  I need to buy like backup ones and everything.
[35:26.750 --> 35:27.310]  I don't have...
[35:27.310 --> 35:29.050]  You know when you're going like, oh, I need like...
[35:29.050 --> 35:30.170]  I have like four or whatever.
[35:30.290 --> 35:31.230]  I have zero of everything.
[35:32.830 --> 35:33.190]  Okay.
[35:34.330 --> 35:36.370]  I don't know what else to say.
[35:37.730 --> 35:38.610]  Neither do I.
[35:38.790 --> 35:39.710]  You can get it in the menu.
[35:40.630 --> 35:41.630]  What? Where?
[35:42.210 --> 35:42.690]  I...
[35:42.690 --> 35:44.570]  You can't stock up on that, can you?
[35:44.690 --> 35:44.850]  No.
[35:44.970 --> 35:46.010]  You can buy one.
[35:46.170 --> 35:46.750]  You can... right.
[35:46.910 --> 35:48.630]  It's... it's... wait, one?
[35:49.050 --> 35:49.570]  Yes.
[35:50.710 --> 35:51.230]  Oh.
[35:52.710 --> 35:54.530]  You... shut up forever.
[36:02.250 --> 36:02.770]  Seriously?
[36:04.850 --> 36:07.070]  I guess we still have one more prep mission.
[36:07.070 --> 36:07.670]  What?
[36:07.910 --> 36:08.030]  Oh, yeah.
[36:08.110 --> 36:08.470]  Oh, shit.
[36:08.570 --> 36:09.210]  We're heisting.
[36:09.830 --> 36:10.250]  Oh, yeah.
[36:10.650 --> 36:11.150]  Steal meth. You got it.
[36:11.310 --> 36:12.430]  A series of meth.
[36:12.810 --> 36:13.550]  Steal the meth.
[36:14.190 --> 36:15.030]  Let's do it, boys.
[36:15.690 --> 36:16.910]  We're on... it's on hard and everything.
[36:17.430 --> 36:18.290]  Hey, guys, we're a good team.
[36:19.110 --> 36:20.090]  So far, so good.
[36:20.430 --> 36:21.710]  This is what happens when Geoff's out of town.
[36:22.210 --> 36:24.810]  When Geoff is away, the rats will play.
[36:25.510 --> 36:26.270]  Squeak, squeak.
[36:26.810 --> 36:27.410]  I'm saying.
[36:29.150 --> 36:30.130]  Oh, I like that.
[36:32.270 --> 36:33.070]  Don't have...
[36:33.070 --> 36:33.710]  Rat masks.
[36:34.370 --> 36:34.590]  Yeah.
[36:35.070 --> 36:35.870]  Or tape.
[36:37.070 --> 36:37.710]  Some bullshit.
[36:41.190 --> 36:42.230]  Casey Jones.
[36:42.830 --> 36:44.010]  I guess skull masks?
[36:44.090 --> 36:45.070]  Skull masks isn't cool.
[36:47.070 --> 36:47.770]  They suck.
[36:48.150 --> 36:49.930]  Putting on the apparatus mask.
[36:50.790 --> 36:54.350]  Not because I'm trying to cover my identity, but because I have severe asthma.
[36:54.850 --> 36:56.550]  And this is a medical device.
[36:59.910 --> 37:01.230]  Maybe pick the mask.
[37:01.350 --> 37:02.250]  Not even wearing the mask.
[37:03.390 --> 37:04.170]  Not yet.
[37:08.910 --> 37:09.790]  Steal meth.
[37:09.930 --> 37:10.570]  All right, Gavin, let's do it.
[37:10.570 --> 37:11.730]  Let's do it.
[37:11.930 --> 37:12.810]  God damn it.
[37:12.870 --> 37:14.030]  All right, Nick, let's do it.
[37:14.150 --> 37:14.690]  All right.
[37:17.310 --> 37:18.290]  Oh, Jesus.
[37:18.670 --> 37:19.510]  Thanks for the lift.
[37:21.770 --> 37:23.910]  This car is 100% death proof.
[37:24.450 --> 37:26.970]  The only thing is, to take full advantage, you gotta be in the trunk.
[37:27.470 --> 37:28.850]  You have to be in your seat.
[37:29.590 --> 37:31.530]  I mean, your seat in the other car.
[37:32.930 --> 37:35.510]  Gavin, I'm fighting every temptation right now.
[37:36.110 --> 37:36.850]  Keep fighting.
[37:37.990 --> 37:38.770]  Oh, Gavin.
[37:39.150 --> 37:39.830]  But you're weaving.
[37:39.830 --> 37:40.990]  You're like a target.
[37:41.570 --> 37:42.010]  Okay.
[37:42.130 --> 37:42.610]  He is.
[37:42.690 --> 37:43.650]  It's like a rabbit.
[37:43.790 --> 37:45.530]  I feel like we're chasing a rabbit on a track.
[37:45.910 --> 37:47.110]  Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.
[37:49.370 --> 37:50.530]  Oh, my car.
[37:52.490 --> 37:53.370]  My car!
[37:56.920 --> 37:57.360]  Ha!
[37:58.680 --> 37:59.420]  Oh, Jesus.
[38:00.100 --> 38:02.380]  Oh, I just saw the back of your car.
[38:02.480 --> 38:02.920]  Shortcut.
[38:03.760 --> 38:04.660]  Oh, boy.
[38:08.860 --> 38:09.740]  Excuse me.
[38:09.860 --> 38:10.120]  Pardon.
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.680]  It's a clip, Eric, of Bobby Bacala at some wrestling event in the past.
[38:15.760 --> 38:16.580]  Like, cutting a promo.
[38:16.700 --> 38:17.320]  Have you seen that?
[38:17.620 --> 38:19.660]  Bobby Bacala was at a wrestling event?
[38:20.600 --> 38:21.640]  Like, a long time ago.
[38:21.720 --> 38:23.580]  Like, when The Sopranos was on.
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.800]  He was, like, cutting a promo.
[38:26.120 --> 38:26.400]  Really?
[38:27.120 --> 38:27.560]  Yeah.
[38:29.120 --> 38:30.320]  I guess you haven't seen it.
[38:30.480 --> 38:30.660]  No.
[38:31.040 --> 38:31.760]  You gotta find it.
[38:33.260 --> 38:34.680]  I think he was with the Dudley Brothers.
[38:35.100 --> 38:35.820]  Whoa, that's cool.
[38:36.200 --> 38:36.420]  It's about...
[38:37.080 --> 38:39.600]  Did he cut a promo about, like, his hobby of trains or what?
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.240]  I would hope so.
[38:41.320 --> 38:41.680]  Choo-choo.
[38:42.600 --> 38:43.900]  Oh, I have seen this.
[38:43.900 --> 38:45.520]  I'm gonna run a train on you.
[38:45.720 --> 38:45.940]  It was.
[38:46.080 --> 38:46.580]  Not that way.
[38:46.700 --> 38:51.320]  It's him and the Dudley Boys in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.
[38:51.600 --> 38:52.060]  I remember this.
[38:53.440 --> 38:53.840]  Wahoo!
[38:54.020 --> 38:54.340]  Hey, look.
[38:54.500 --> 38:55.160]  It's the windmill farm.
[38:56.780 --> 38:58.500]  I bet you could drive through those windmills.
[38:58.580 --> 38:59.100]  It wouldn't even hurt you.
[38:59.820 --> 39:01.040]  In this armored car?
[39:05.290 --> 39:06.030]  Oh, sorry.
[39:06.110 --> 39:07.150]  I started drooling.
[39:07.270 --> 39:07.890]  I'm thinking about it.
[39:10.450 --> 39:11.370]  Where are you, Gavin?
[39:11.770 --> 39:13.950]  Are you just way in the back because you're in your shitty little thing?
[39:14.730 --> 39:15.250]  Uh, pretty much.
[39:15.590 --> 39:15.790]  Okay.
[39:16.010 --> 39:20.010]  I took a pretty nasty spill and came probably the closest to death I've ever been.
[39:20.410 --> 39:22.350]  But I said nothing about it and ate some snacks.
[39:23.270 --> 39:23.670]  Nice!
[39:27.010 --> 39:29.050]  That'd be like you if you were in GTA.
[39:29.310 --> 39:32.210]  Like, if you, as Gavin, were injected into this game.
[39:37.420 --> 39:38.320]  I'm almost there.
[39:38.400 --> 39:40.340]  Well, it turns out he got closer to death.
[39:40.380 --> 39:40.760]  Hey, Gavin!
[39:43.840 --> 39:46.420]  I literally just said, I'm almost there.
[39:47.140 --> 39:48.200]  Yeah, I'm almost there.
[39:48.440 --> 39:50.820]  Do you want to drive my car this time and I'll just sit in the passenger seat?
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.060]  No, no, you're fine. Drive it.
[39:52.120 --> 39:54.700]  No, no, you drive because I'm gonna, I'm gonna run to the back.
[39:55.200 --> 39:55.860]  Ah, got it.
[39:55.960 --> 39:57.860]  Glad you buy that super heavy armor again.
[39:58.240 --> 39:59.300]  Glad I bought it last time.
[40:01.140 --> 40:03.460]  That pole really snuck up on me.
[40:03.780 --> 40:04.840]  Yeah, it does that.
[40:05.480 --> 40:07.520]  I'd argue you really snuck up on the pole.
[40:07.600 --> 40:08.580]  The pole was stationary.
[40:08.900 --> 40:09.100]  It's true.
[40:09.300 --> 40:10.560]  The pole claimed the space.
[40:11.280 --> 40:12.880]  Yeah, you scared the shit out of it.
[40:12.880 --> 40:14.560]  Yeah, it reacted. You died.
[40:16.240 --> 40:18.840]  This is, the pole just going, I killed a guy!
[40:19.100 --> 40:20.160]  Oh my god!
[40:20.960 --> 40:22.600]  I'll have to live with this for the rest of my days.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  What? Which one's Nick's car?
[40:28.420 --> 40:29.060]  This armored one.
[40:29.200 --> 40:29.860]  I'm gonna do this again.
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.100]  All right, let's do it.
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.760]  This car is 100% death proof.
[40:33.940 --> 40:34.780]  It's just in the trunk.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  Gavin, are you getting in or not?
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.420]  I will.
[40:39.880 --> 40:40.360]  Okay, I'm in.
[40:40.940 --> 40:41.480]  God damn.
[40:47.130 --> 40:49.290]  Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
[40:52.130 --> 40:53.750]  Feel free to go at any point.
[40:54.710 --> 40:55.290]  I'm going.
[40:59.760 --> 41:00.460]  I'm flying.
[41:01.120 --> 41:02.040]  Yeah, yeah, we're almost there.
[41:02.200 --> 41:02.600]  Six times.
[41:06.260 --> 41:07.780]  Nick got up and went to go piss.
[41:07.920 --> 41:09.920]  We could get out of this car, get in a different car,
[41:10.040 --> 41:11.580]  and then he would just be in the middle of the floor.
[41:14.120 --> 41:16.180]  Oh, I shouldn't, but this looks tempting.
[41:16.640 --> 41:17.000]  Do it.
[41:17.340 --> 41:19.400]  Shark gut! Shark gut!
[41:19.400 --> 41:21.860]  Oh, I couldn't get enough speed to really...
[41:21.860 --> 41:22.720]  Ah, that sucked.
[41:23.160 --> 41:26.860]  Yeah, what if Nick came back and he was alone in the passenger seat of the car
[41:26.860 --> 41:27.660]  and we were in the strip club?
[41:28.820 --> 41:31.100]  All right, Vanilla Unicorn, here we come.
[41:31.420 --> 41:34.520]  That would be in the middle of a heist mission.
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.200]  It's so funny.
[41:36.780 --> 41:37.700]  Where'd you guys go?
[41:38.060 --> 41:38.920]  Why are we at the strip club?
[41:41.880 --> 41:42.760]  Speed racing.
[41:42.760 --> 41:46.940]  I'm trying to get crazy taxi bonus where you drive against traffic.
[41:47.080 --> 41:47.180]  Oh, great.
[41:47.380 --> 41:49.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:49.400 --> 41:51.240]  And it gives me points.
[41:51.340 --> 41:53.720]  You get more dollars for delivering these guys to the KFC.
[41:54.780 --> 41:57.420]  I was so excited for the new crazy taxi game.
[41:57.620 --> 41:59.400]  It's like, we just haven't had one of those in a while.
[41:59.520 --> 41:59.640]  Yeah.
[41:59.700 --> 42:03.700]  And then learning it's like a massive multiplayer, like, open world thing.
[42:03.840 --> 42:04.640]  I don't know.
[42:05.180 --> 42:06.440]  There's one version.
[42:06.660 --> 42:07.200]  It's crazy.
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.640]  There's one version since the original that is the best version of that game,
[42:11.680 --> 42:13.060]  and it's the iPhone version.
[42:13.560 --> 42:13.840]  What?
[42:14.220 --> 42:14.600]  Oh, really?
[42:14.760 --> 42:15.720]  The iPhone version of that game?
[42:16.700 --> 42:17.360]  No, no, no, no.
[42:17.420 --> 42:18.780]  Since the, like, originals.
[42:18.780 --> 42:19.960]  Since the one on the Dreamcast.
[42:20.320 --> 42:22.640]  Because the iPhone version has the original soundtrack.
[42:24.200 --> 42:25.080]  The offspring?
[42:25.660 --> 42:25.980]  Yes.
[42:26.820 --> 42:27.720]  Is that Pizza Hut?
[42:28.260 --> 42:29.220]  I don't remember.
[42:29.340 --> 42:32.440]  I think, I think they're Pizza Hut KFC, but they might have been renamed.
[42:33.520 --> 42:37.360]  But they have, it's, the fact they have the original soundtrack is awesome.
[42:37.620 --> 42:38.460]  It's so crazy.
[42:40.860 --> 42:43.680]  Like, that soundtrack is like more than 50% of that game.
[42:44.000 --> 42:44.560]  Oh, absolutely.
[42:44.880 --> 42:48.520]  It's like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, where, what an awesome game.
[42:49.260 --> 42:52.440]  But boy, the soundtrack did a lot of heavy lifting for, like,
[42:52.620 --> 42:56.500]  making it playable infinitely in the missions where it's like,
[42:56.540 --> 42:58.160]  I have to get skate and I only got scat.
[42:58.340 --> 42:58.600]  Fuck.
[43:01.400 --> 43:03.260]  The soundtrack did a lot of heavy lifting there.
[43:03.700 --> 43:05.820]  And, uh, yeah, Crazy Taxi's the same.
[43:05.860 --> 43:11.140]  I was, uh, reminiscing last night about Disney Extreme Skateboarding.
[43:11.240 --> 43:11.660]  Oh, yeah.
[43:11.980 --> 43:12.540]  Tony Hawk Team.
[43:12.560 --> 43:13.160]  Yeah, I remember that.
[43:13.340 --> 43:13.560]  The Disney thing.
[43:13.640 --> 43:14.360]  Yeah, that has a good soundtrack.
[43:14.560 --> 43:15.140]  It's so funny.
[43:15.420 --> 43:17.640]  It does, but it's also, like, really funny to be like,
[43:17.640 --> 43:20.880]  okay, what is, like, the youth version of a Tony Hawk soundtrack?
[43:20.880 --> 43:24.360]  Yeah, it's, it's like a lot of, it's like some of the same songs.
[43:24.500 --> 43:27.120]  And then it's like, here's Simple Plan or something like that.
[43:27.300 --> 43:28.340]  And you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[43:28.580 --> 43:32.640]  All right, uh, Aggressive Inline has a really good soundtrack too.
[43:32.780 --> 43:38.680]  I love those games where, uh, like specifically those extreme sports mid-2000s games.
[43:40.200 --> 43:41.000]  All right.
[43:42.260 --> 43:42.480]  Yep.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.400]  Time to kill some meth dealers.
[43:44.900 --> 43:45.540]  Let's do it.
[43:46.080 --> 43:47.040]  10-8, you slow it down, Gordon.
[43:47.200 --> 43:47.740]  Oh, who just went?
[43:48.160 --> 43:48.400]  Me.
[43:49.400 --> 43:49.800]  I'm okay.
[43:52.200 --> 43:53.420]  Uh, let's spread out a little.
[43:53.540 --> 43:54.340]  Gavin, you gotta put your mask on.
[43:55.680 --> 43:57.720]  I should probably not be running down the middle of...
[43:57.720 --> 43:59.940]  You know, I thought so too, but yeah, you know, you're doing your thing.
[44:00.500 --> 44:02.640]  I'm peeling off left, Andrew, if you want to do that also.
[44:02.980 --> 44:04.020]  Then I can, uh, yep.
[44:04.480 --> 44:05.940]  What gun are you guys thinking for this?
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.640]  I have, I have the special carbine.
[44:08.960 --> 44:10.740]  Yeah, I also have the special carbine.
[44:14.220 --> 44:14.860]  Good lord.
[44:16.120 --> 44:17.740]  Wait, why are those guys white now?
[44:18.020 --> 44:18.900]  Yeah, who are the white ones?
[44:19.340 --> 44:20.380]  Oh, did they meth up?
[44:21.600 --> 44:21.900]  Oh.
[44:23.620 --> 44:25.240]  They're just roiding themselves up.
[44:25.360 --> 44:25.500]  Yeah.
[44:28.990 --> 44:30.570]  Oh my god, I can't hit anything.
[44:30.650 --> 44:30.930]  Oh, fuck.
[44:36.940 --> 44:38.580]  Where are you, you little prick?
[44:39.200 --> 44:41.280]  I'm not hitting a single fucking guy.
[44:41.440 --> 44:43.360]  I'm feeling it, it's the same fucking thing for me.
[44:45.020 --> 44:47.940]  It's like the snap aim is low.
[44:48.780 --> 44:49.500]  I need to get a better angle.
[44:50.660 --> 44:51.240]  There we go.
[44:51.240 --> 44:52.200]  There we go.
[44:52.240 --> 44:52.580]  There we go.
[44:57.400 --> 44:58.340]  Oh shit.
[44:59.680 --> 45:00.400]  Come on.
[45:00.680 --> 45:02.820]  I'm trying to kind of flank them from the side here.
[45:07.540 --> 45:09.320]  Uh, how did I miss that?
[45:12.820 --> 45:15.260]  Snacks, put on some armor I bought.
[45:16.520 --> 45:17.020]  Caught him.
[45:19.080 --> 45:20.020]  Let's cover here.
[45:22.020 --> 45:22.540]  Shit.
[45:22.700 --> 45:22.900]  Ow.
[45:23.120 --> 45:23.500]  Hey, Andrew.
[45:24.600 --> 45:24.880]  Hey.
[45:29.160 --> 45:31.280]  Dude, these methed out guys are crazy.
[45:35.010 --> 45:36.450]  Thank god for you, you prick.
[45:38.850 --> 45:40.950]  All right, let's...
[45:40.950 --> 45:42.230]  Are they just all inside?
[45:44.510 --> 45:45.470]  I guess so.
[45:48.650 --> 45:50.690]  Oh yeah, see them through the windows.
[45:52.730 --> 45:55.330]  I hear them talking shit inside.
[46:00.560 --> 46:01.820]  Die, die, Jesus.
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.360]  Oh, I got someone.
[46:05.640 --> 46:06.480]  Steal the tanker.
[46:06.700 --> 46:07.440]  Oh shit.
[46:08.440 --> 46:08.880]  I got...
[46:08.880 --> 46:09.700]  There's the tanker here.
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.380]  What are we supposed to do with it?
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.540]  I'm going to steal it.
[46:13.740 --> 46:14.300]  Oh my god.
[46:14.600 --> 46:15.200]  Andrew, you can do it.
[46:15.220 --> 46:15.720]  I believe in you.
[46:17.100 --> 46:17.820]  Oh shit.
[46:17.960 --> 46:18.940]  I'm supposed to steal this?
[46:19.400 --> 46:20.780]  You need to hook a thing to it.
[46:20.940 --> 46:21.820]  You gotta hook up a... yeah.
[46:25.500 --> 46:26.880]  Be nice if they mark that.
[46:26.920 --> 46:27.280]  Boom.
[46:27.860 --> 46:29.200]  Die, you prick.
[46:33.440 --> 46:34.820]  Yeah, where's the front bit?
[46:35.120 --> 46:35.140]  Do I have any armor?
[46:36.000 --> 46:36.300]  Oh no.
[46:37.000 --> 46:37.940]  Have you found it?
[46:38.100 --> 46:38.320]  Ow.
[46:38.700 --> 46:39.280]  Not yet.
[46:41.540 --> 46:42.600]  The front fell off.
[46:42.760 --> 46:43.100]  Fuck.
[46:46.740 --> 46:48.100]  Oh, fuck me.
[46:48.420 --> 46:49.540]  Oh, fuck us.
[46:51.160 --> 46:55.140]  Well, I think the truck that was attached to it probably blew up.
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.280]  Oh, I think we have to kill them.
[46:57.520 --> 46:58.400]  We should probably just kill them.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.060]  Kill who?
[47:00.080 --> 47:01.360]  It felt like they just kept spawning.
[47:01.560 --> 47:01.680]  Yeah.
[47:02.020 --> 47:02.820]  I don't think they did.
[47:02.880 --> 47:05.340]  We had whittled them down quite a bit.
[47:06.120 --> 47:06.480]  Okay.
[47:06.700 --> 47:08.820]  What if we just show up with the front half?
[47:10.340 --> 47:11.200]  I mean, that'd be nice.
[47:11.480 --> 47:11.580]  The what?
[47:11.620 --> 47:12.780]  Yeah, I don't think we have one.
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.240]  I barely have a back.
[47:20.120 --> 47:21.020]  You have a long back.
[47:21.060 --> 47:21.580]  What are you talking about?
[47:21.820 --> 47:23.100]  Man, this guy's all back, too, man.
[47:23.100 --> 47:23.600]  It's fucked up.
[47:23.700 --> 47:24.340]  Yeah, it's literally.
[47:25.800 --> 47:26.460]  The old backs.
[47:31.300 --> 47:31.980]  Where are we?
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.680]  Uh, huh.
[47:33.980 --> 47:36.520]  Hey, oh, a buggy.
[47:36.760 --> 47:37.060]  That's a lot of fronts.
[47:37.940 --> 47:38.920]  Oh, they're all here.
[47:39.240 --> 47:39.940]  Oh, wow.
[47:40.080 --> 47:41.980]  We checkpointed in like a better way.
[47:42.100 --> 47:44.000]  We actually progressed via the checkpoint.
[47:44.160 --> 47:45.520]  So these were not here, right?
[47:45.700 --> 47:46.300]  Did we blow them all?
[47:46.560 --> 47:47.400]  I don't know.
[47:48.160 --> 47:49.780]  I didn't blow up anything.
[47:50.920 --> 47:52.220]  Yeah, I don't think.
[47:52.220 --> 47:54.440]  That made it sound like I blew up stuff, but I didn't.
[47:54.540 --> 47:55.560]  I did just genuinely.
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.580]  Is Gavin taking it?
[47:58.280 --> 47:59.520]  Let's see if I can hit this bad boy.
[47:59.880 --> 48:00.000]  Okay.
[48:01.140 --> 48:02.920]  Oh, hey, okay.
[48:04.260 --> 48:05.160]  Let's go.
[48:06.820 --> 48:07.420]  What?
[48:08.220 --> 48:10.380]  Nick, what are you doing?
[48:11.860 --> 48:14.240]  Nick, why did you jump out?
[48:15.020 --> 48:16.860]  I was laying there for ages.
[48:18.460 --> 48:20.280]  I watched you jump out.
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.200]  I watched Gavin roll into you.
[48:22.300 --> 48:24.500]  And then I watched Andrew purposely run into you.
[48:24.920 --> 48:25.280]  I know.
[48:25.320 --> 48:26.420]  I didn't even see him.
[48:29.160 --> 48:31.100]  I just wanted to take the buggy.
[48:32.180 --> 48:33.180]  The buggy's great.
[48:33.420 --> 48:33.940]  Little BF.
[48:34.400 --> 48:34.520]  Yeah.
[48:35.860 --> 48:37.840]  I wanted to live and have a good time.
[48:38.140 --> 48:40.040]  As I jumped out, Gavin rolled over.
[48:40.060 --> 48:41.500]  I've got some bad news for you.
[48:41.740 --> 48:42.940]  I just don't.
[48:44.120 --> 48:44.820]  What's the bad news?
[48:45.920 --> 48:46.700]  You died.
[48:46.820 --> 48:47.560]  You did not live.
[48:47.700 --> 48:49.060]  For someone who just wanted to live.
[48:49.160 --> 48:52.640]  I hope that we didn't, for some reason, kick it.
[48:52.720 --> 48:53.840]  And now there's a bunch of meth heads.
[48:54.080 --> 48:54.440]  No.
[48:56.620 --> 48:57.960]  Who wants to come with me in the buggy?
[48:58.080 --> 48:58.540]  There's two of them.
[48:58.920 --> 48:59.360]  Nobody.
[49:00.700 --> 49:01.920]  I'm going to enjoy your semi, prick.
[49:04.760 --> 49:06.100]  A hot prick from Nick.
[49:07.180 --> 49:07.860]  Hey, hey.
[49:09.460 --> 49:10.760]  Somebody talking about peas?
[49:14.100 --> 49:14.540]  No.
[49:16.360 --> 49:17.160]  Oh, Eric.
[49:23.240 --> 49:24.720]  You're not dicking around, by the way?
[49:24.760 --> 49:25.000]  No.
[49:26.760 --> 49:27.120]  Yes.
[49:30.540 --> 49:31.660]  Oh, God in heaven.
[49:33.480 --> 49:34.020]  Oh, wow.
[49:34.080 --> 49:35.360]  There's tanker health on this thing.
[49:36.260 --> 49:37.040]  Oh, big time.
[49:37.440 --> 49:37.800]  Oh, no.
[49:37.940 --> 49:39.860]  Nick, you want to dive out of that or are you good?
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.140]  No, I'm quite comfy now.
[49:42.220 --> 49:42.640]  Thank you.
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.600]  Oh, we only have to do it a mile or two.
[49:44.860 --> 49:45.120]  Let's go.
[49:46.980 --> 49:50.360]  I paid like $750,000 for this thing.
[49:50.620 --> 49:51.880]  And the guy told me it was a transformer.
[49:53.520 --> 49:56.940]  Yeah, but he like, I think that he's too afraid to transform.
[49:57.060 --> 49:57.980]  I think that's the problem.
[49:58.440 --> 50:00.340]  Yeah, I think we just got to get him more comfortable.
[50:00.500 --> 50:03.580]  Nick has not driven more than 30 feet without running into something.
[50:05.200 --> 50:05.600]  Yeah.
[50:09.740 --> 50:11.100]  Where's the turret car?
[50:12.380 --> 50:13.080]  I need it.
[50:14.340 --> 50:15.500]  I got you.
[50:17.160 --> 50:17.960]  Uh oh.
[50:18.760 --> 50:20.160]  I'm getting all kinds of shot up.
[50:20.740 --> 50:22.360]  Yeah, they're smashing all my shit to pieces.
[50:22.540 --> 50:23.020]  Yeah, we're trying.
[50:23.060 --> 50:23.700]  We're trying, man.
[50:25.860 --> 50:27.020]  I'm shitting this thing.
[50:27.020 --> 50:28.180]  Ah, my tires! My tires!
[50:29.820 --> 50:31.280]  I don't want the buggy anymore!
[50:32.400 --> 50:32.760]  Shortcut.
[50:32.800 --> 50:33.080]  I died.
[50:33.920 --> 50:34.640]  Oh boy.
[50:35.100 --> 50:37.980]  Yeah, we just, we got caught up on a car and I was trying to blast it.
[50:38.040 --> 50:38.680]  There's nothing we could do.
[50:40.300 --> 50:41.700]  It's a pretty short drive though.
[50:41.740 --> 50:42.440]  You were almost there.
[50:42.660 --> 50:43.780]  Keep filling your food bag.
[50:44.260 --> 50:44.940]  Yeah, no, I got it.
[50:46.300 --> 50:48.840]  I didn't think that we were going to have to run into what we ran into.
[50:49.460 --> 50:50.700]  Keep stuffing your food hole.
[50:51.380 --> 50:52.040]  I got it now.
[50:53.260 --> 50:54.740]  I remember what I said about being a good team.
[50:54.960 --> 50:55.720]  I still think we are.
[50:56.740 --> 50:57.060]  Good.
[50:57.300 --> 50:57.760]  I'm glad.
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.420]  You disagreed?
[51:01.640 --> 51:01.960]  No.
[51:02.260 --> 51:02.480]  Oh.
[51:02.680 --> 51:03.840]  I'm just glad you reconfirmed.
[51:03.900 --> 51:06.240]  The way you set that up, it made me feel like you're about to flip that.
[51:06.320 --> 51:06.640]  No!
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.220]  You getting in the buggy again?
[51:11.120 --> 51:11.840]  I'm thinking about it.
[51:14.100 --> 51:15.000]  Son of a stupid.
[51:15.780 --> 51:16.100]  Why?
[51:16.620 --> 51:18.080]  I guess I'll ride with Gavin.
[51:18.280 --> 51:19.080]  I guess I'll ride with Gavin.
[51:19.180 --> 51:20.140]  You don't have to ride with Gavin.
[51:20.260 --> 51:20.640]  Ride in your own fucking car.
[51:20.740 --> 51:21.800]  No, I'll protect him.
[51:22.040 --> 51:22.580]  Alright.
[51:22.980 --> 51:24.940]  Which one are you in?
[51:25.820 --> 51:26.100]  Red.
[51:26.220 --> 51:28.260]  I got a big old convoy.
[51:28.380 --> 51:29.460]  It's gonna be a transformer.
[51:30.220 --> 51:30.780]  Oh, there's red.
[51:31.540 --> 51:31.860]  Jesus.
[51:33.280 --> 51:33.760]  Oh.
[51:34.220 --> 51:35.240]  Are you getting in this?
[51:35.500 --> 51:35.780]  Yes!
[51:36.960 --> 51:37.100]  Oh.
[51:37.200 --> 51:37.340]  Sweet.
[51:37.640 --> 51:37.860]  Let's go.
[51:38.920 --> 51:39.400]  Guys!
[51:40.400 --> 51:40.880]  Transformer.
[51:41.420 --> 51:43.140]  All the vehicles are on fire!
[51:44.080 --> 51:44.560]  Transformer.
[51:44.560 --> 51:46.940]  Who blows it up and then stole Nick's spot?
[51:50.000 --> 51:51.300]  It's so specific.
[51:52.040 --> 51:55.520]  Who blew everything up and then stole Nick's spot?
[51:55.620 --> 51:57.040]  You fucking prick.
[51:57.340 --> 51:57.980]  Dog test!
[51:58.240 --> 51:58.680]  Oh, you got it.
[52:06.820 --> 52:08.680]  Hey guys, I think we're a really good team.
[52:09.480 --> 52:10.460]  I think we're...
[52:10.460 --> 52:12.320]  I think we might be a little loopy.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.500]  I think we've been playing this for a little bit.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.900]  I think we might be a little loopy.
[52:16.000 --> 52:17.920]  I've been huffing pissoline all morning.
[52:18.560 --> 52:20.540]  I was just trying to cut in front of you.
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.040]  Trying to steal it.
[52:39.160 --> 52:40.620]  Your food bag hurts?
[52:45.660 --> 52:47.080]  Sun's getting real low again.
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.600]  Oh, it's low.
[52:50.380 --> 52:52.900]  I've seen a lot of sunsets on this hike.
[52:53.200 --> 52:54.220]  Andrew, Andrew, Andrew, we can do it.
[52:54.340 --> 52:55.040]  Andrew, we can do it.
[52:55.040 --> 52:56.860]  Andrew, Andrew, we can do it.
[52:56.920 --> 53:00.100]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[53:00.200 --> 53:01.060]  I believe in us, Gavin.
[53:02.940 --> 53:03.820]  Oh, shit.
[53:06.700 --> 53:07.640]  Where's the problem, Eric?
[53:07.700 --> 53:09.260]  I don't know how to do it once we're there.
[53:14.120 --> 53:14.520]  Fuck.
[53:15.320 --> 53:18.040]  So, Nick is firing a gun, I think.
[53:19.220 --> 53:20.560]  Yeah, definitely not at your tires.
[53:21.580 --> 53:22.680]  I mean, we're about to...
[53:24.500 --> 53:25.900]  We're trying to beat the level.
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.220]  You got it. There it is, hooked up, right?
[53:30.420 --> 53:30.960]  Yeah, we got it.
[53:30.960 --> 53:32.320]  There you go. All right, all right, let's go.
[53:34.380 --> 53:36.180]  Oh, my God, I'm crying. That was so...
[53:37.820 --> 53:38.460]  Oh, Andrew.
[53:38.800 --> 53:39.180]  Oh, my God.
[53:40.720 --> 53:42.660]  That pull is strong.
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.260]  Oh, there we go. Now we broke. It took two of us, but we got it.
[53:46.140 --> 53:46.780]  Could you...
[53:47.580 --> 53:49.040]  I'm stuck on the pool.
[53:49.340 --> 53:51.160]  We only have two and a half minutes to do this.
[53:51.580 --> 53:53.980]  Much like, much like Eric at the unicorn.
[53:54.280 --> 53:55.120]  He's stuck on the pool.
[53:55.560 --> 53:56.920]  Guys, now you know how it feels.
[54:01.500 --> 54:02.640]  All right, that's what happened to me last...
[54:02.640 --> 54:04.100]  Oh, the tanker!
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.440]  Hurry, hurry, Andrew, hurry!
[54:06.780 --> 54:09.200]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[54:11.360 --> 54:13.980]  All right, group with the tanker gets paid more on the final race.
[54:13.980 --> 54:14.740]  Yeah, there you go. All right.
[54:14.820 --> 54:15.180]  Oh, wait, no.
[54:15.200 --> 54:15.420]  Let's do it.
[54:16.360 --> 54:16.640]  No.
[54:16.720 --> 54:17.040]  Damn it.
[54:17.080 --> 54:17.900]  Go, come on.
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.500]  I swiped it.
[54:18.640 --> 54:20.460]  I got heisted in the middle of a heist.
[54:20.700 --> 54:21.920]  I got swiped.
[54:23.140 --> 54:24.640]  All right, I'll just be battering Ram.
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.860]  Yeah, you guys lead and just kind of take them out here.
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.000]  Oh, man, I hope the transformer doesn't mind.
[54:35.960 --> 54:37.760]  Oh, hell of a shortcut, bud.
[54:38.160 --> 54:38.880]  You're insane.
[54:41.120 --> 54:41.600]  Andrew.
[54:42.160 --> 54:43.880]  It looks like it's wiggling a real...
[54:44.820 --> 54:48.560]  The Austin Powers did a little bit between a couch and I don't even know.
[54:49.260 --> 54:49.640]  We're fine.
[54:50.420 --> 54:50.920]  Got him.
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.080]  The driver's dead.
[54:52.360 --> 54:53.820]  Muscle flesh is coming out of the front.
[54:54.560 --> 54:55.840]  We only got a minute left.
[54:56.020 --> 54:56.260]  Yep.
[54:57.280 --> 54:58.900]  Oh, I killed that motorcyclist.
[54:58.980 --> 54:59.140]  Whoops.
[55:03.600 --> 55:06.700]  I think I stole a bike.
[55:07.180 --> 55:07.620]  He's lost.
[55:07.780 --> 55:07.940]  Yeah.
[55:12.060 --> 55:12.420]  Jeez.
[55:13.100 --> 55:14.100]  Keep it going, Andrew.
[55:14.220 --> 55:15.440]  You gotta make those turns, buddy.
[55:16.220 --> 55:17.080]  There you go.
[55:17.160 --> 55:17.620]  Oh, my.
[55:19.120 --> 55:20.160]  Oh, that guy.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.020]  All right, we're almost there.
[55:24.100 --> 55:24.640]  We're almost there.
[55:24.720 --> 55:25.100]  Keep it going.
[55:25.380 --> 55:25.900]  Minute left.
[55:26.360 --> 55:27.040]  Come on, keep it going.
[55:27.100 --> 55:27.440]  Rock and roll.
[55:27.580 --> 55:27.920]  Let's go.
[55:28.680 --> 55:29.420]  Come on, Andrew.
[55:29.780 --> 55:30.540]  Okay, they're on our tail.
[55:30.540 --> 55:32.080]  I can't believe that we have a tanker.
[55:32.140 --> 55:33.800]  They're on our tail, but I can't shoot them.
[55:34.360 --> 55:34.900]  Killed the driver.
[55:34.920 --> 55:35.740]  I'm gonna shoot the tanker.
[55:36.680 --> 55:37.280]  That's fine.
[55:37.440 --> 55:38.740]  We're barely taking any damage.
[55:39.300 --> 55:39.880]  No, it's fine.
[55:39.960 --> 55:40.280]  We're fine.
[55:40.400 --> 55:40.640]  We're fine.
[55:40.740 --> 55:40.920]  We're fine.
[55:40.960 --> 55:42.160]  I would love your help.
[55:42.720 --> 55:43.280]  We're shortcutting away.
[55:43.280 --> 55:44.440]  Where are you going, firstly?
[55:45.180 --> 55:46.440]  I'm following the marker.
[55:46.520 --> 55:47.980]  Yeah, following the marker here.
[55:48.860 --> 55:49.100]  Oh.
[55:49.300 --> 55:49.700]  Uh-oh.
[55:50.780 --> 55:52.580]  Oh, guys, this tanker's losing health.
[55:53.620 --> 55:54.040]  Got him.
[55:54.180 --> 55:54.960]  Yes, I got him.
[55:55.060 --> 55:55.600]  Fuck yes.
[55:55.840 --> 55:56.140]  He got him.
[55:56.140 --> 55:56.420]  He got him.
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.380]  We're good.
[55:57.380 --> 55:58.980]  All right, we got guys coming across the way.
[55:59.140 --> 56:00.320]  We only have 30 seconds.
[56:00.620 --> 56:01.740]  Don't run into us.
[56:01.780 --> 56:02.520]  What are you doing?
[56:03.140 --> 56:03.520]  Deliver it.
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.220]  There's not enough time for you to steal it back.
[56:05.320 --> 56:06.040]  Take the shortcuts.
[56:07.460 --> 56:08.180]  Come on, Andrew.
[56:08.280 --> 56:08.940]  Come on, Andrew.
[56:09.220 --> 56:09.900]  Not that shortcut.
[56:10.480 --> 56:11.380]  Yeah, that's not one.
[56:11.700 --> 56:12.220]  Come on, Andrew.
[56:12.260 --> 56:12.860]  You're almost there.
[56:13.100 --> 56:14.620]  Oh my God, get there, Anderson.
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.300]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[56:16.300 --> 56:16.760]  Come on.
[56:17.620 --> 56:18.100]  You're almost there.
[56:18.140 --> 56:18.600]  You're almost there.
[56:18.660 --> 56:19.160]  You're almost there.
[56:19.440 --> 56:20.300]  10 seconds.
[56:21.540 --> 56:21.860]  Oh.
[56:23.260 --> 56:23.620]  Got it.
[56:24.020 --> 56:24.340]  Yes.
[56:24.860 --> 56:25.180]  Yeah.
[56:27.600 --> 56:27.960]  Bravo.
[56:28.500 --> 56:29.880]  You didn't blow yourselves up.
[56:30.060 --> 56:30.660]  What a finish.
[56:30.920 --> 56:31.780]  Not on this run.
[56:32.240 --> 56:34.560]  As much as I want the old tanker sitting right here.
[56:35.060 --> 56:37.800]  I'm gonna empty it quick and get out of here and sell it for some crap.
[56:44.410 --> 56:45.030]  Did we do it?
[56:45.870 --> 56:46.530]  We did it.
[56:47.410 --> 56:48.830]  There's no way that was the whole mission.
[56:48.930 --> 56:49.570]  That was it, dude.
[56:50.910 --> 56:51.630]  No way.
[56:51.750 --> 56:52.990]  We almost didn't pass it.
[56:53.030 --> 56:54.010]  What are you talking about?
[56:55.190 --> 56:59.850]  It just felt like we ran up to some meth heads and then we checkpointed away from them and then
[56:59.850 --> 57:02.810]  we just crashed into each other for like 10 minutes.
[57:02.970 --> 57:05.310]  Yeah, we skipped the mission, but that was it.
[57:05.730 --> 57:05.930]  Yeah.
[57:09.270 --> 57:10.110]  That's crazy.
[57:11.510 --> 57:12.970]  Who blew up all the cars and took all the spots?
[57:12.970 --> 57:14.630]  Well, I guess next video will be the heist.
[57:14.970 --> 57:15.410]  Wow.
[57:15.830 --> 57:16.210]  Wow.
[57:17.210 --> 57:17.970]  That's rough.
[57:18.750 --> 57:19.790]  That's pretty incredible.
[57:20.330 --> 57:21.510]  These heists have been so good.
[57:22.010 --> 57:23.450]  I hope the audience likes them.
[57:23.570 --> 57:26.530]  If they don't, that sucks that we've made so many.
[57:29.190 --> 57:30.450]  Then they were just for us.
[57:30.670 --> 57:31.030]  Yeah.
[57:31.190 --> 57:32.830]  Oh, look at us hanging out.
[57:33.170 --> 57:33.430]  Yeah.
[57:33.930 --> 57:40.290]  I will say, I was proofing part two, the team tape one, and man, team tape has said a lot.
[57:40.470 --> 57:42.170]  Yeah, we really go for team tape.
[57:42.330 --> 57:45.810]  We really go for team tape and then it doesn't come back until like the sixth video.
[57:46.670 --> 57:51.750]  I feel like I should send a note to the editor and say, please remove half of the team tapes.
[57:52.250 --> 57:53.010]  No way, baby.
[57:53.050 --> 57:53.670]  We're team tape.
[57:53.750 --> 57:54.450]  What are you talking about?
[57:55.690 --> 57:56.510]  Well, we did it.
[57:57.070 --> 57:59.050]  The next one is the actual heist.
