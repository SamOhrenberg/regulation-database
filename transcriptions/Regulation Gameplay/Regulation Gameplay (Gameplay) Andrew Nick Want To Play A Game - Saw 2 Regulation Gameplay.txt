[00:06.800 --> 00:08.200]  You ready to start, Nick?
[00:08.360 --> 00:08.660]  Yeah.
[00:09.600 --> 00:12.800]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:12.940 --> 00:14.240]  We are in October.
[00:14.480 --> 00:18.200]  It is time for some spooky games, which I assume this is,
[00:18.300 --> 00:19.360]  but I've never played it.
[00:19.680 --> 00:20.800]  Nick, how do you feel about Saw?
[00:21.040 --> 00:21.980]  Like the movies.
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.720]  At least the first two or three.
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.660]  First three are good.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.640]  Never played the games, never knew there were games.
[00:27.960 --> 00:30.480]  I wonder what happens if we just let that timer
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.020]  in the in the back right fully deplete.
[00:33.780 --> 00:34.780]  That 11 minutes.
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.420]  First 11 minutes of this video, just sitting in this lobby is waiting.
[00:41.800 --> 00:43.640]  There has to be a might be more engaging than the gameplay.
[00:45.620 --> 00:47.940]  Whoa. Oh, do you want to play?
[00:48.120 --> 00:50.940]  Holy God. I do want to play a game.
[00:51.560 --> 00:54.100]  This game flashback and bonus video.
[00:55.940 --> 00:57.740]  Oh, there's a bonus video.
[00:59.280 --> 01:00.980]  Oh, I got to get the bonus video.
[01:02.300 --> 01:03.860]  Eric's yelling at me from somewhere.
[01:05.320 --> 01:07.460]  Create a new save game will overwrite auto.
[01:07.480 --> 01:08.900]  Yeah, who cares? I've never played this.
[01:10.020 --> 01:11.420]  OK, normal, insane.
[01:11.700 --> 01:12.700]  Those are your options.
[01:13.040 --> 01:13.800]  No easy.
[01:15.280 --> 01:17.380]  Maybe we should see what we can do with normal.
[01:17.600 --> 01:20.860]  Yeah. Yeah, I want to actually play the game.
[01:21.540 --> 01:23.580]  We've learned a few things about hard modes lately.
[01:26.420 --> 01:26.820]  Jigsaw.
[01:28.160 --> 01:30.140]  Weak walls can be smashed with the what?
[01:30.320 --> 01:31.580]  Smashed open with the right tool.
[01:32.680 --> 01:33.880]  I don't know why I just assume
[01:33.880 --> 01:35.940]  this was like escape the trap simulator.
[01:36.540 --> 01:37.720]  You would. You know what?
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.580]  I think that's what you would want this to be.
[01:40.260 --> 01:43.240]  It would be insane if they don't really do a lot of that.
[01:44.740 --> 01:46.260]  Can't wait to break through some walls, though.
[01:47.240 --> 01:48.180]  Oh, shit. Oh.
[01:52.560 --> 01:54.700]  Maybe let me look at the back of the box.
[01:56.180 --> 01:57.800]  No descriptor. Whoa.
[02:01.770 --> 02:03.910]  Oh, no, there's a key in your face.
[02:03.910 --> 02:08.090]  Oh, and they're very few frames.
[02:12.010 --> 02:15.180]  I can't tell if this is a design choice
[02:16.070 --> 02:20.660]  or if it's just like 15 frames per second.
[02:49.140 --> 02:51.920]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[02:52.420 --> 02:56.660]  Wait, oh, I hate it. Oh look in the but I'm supposed to mash a
[02:57.840 --> 03:04.900]  I'm supposed. I don't want I don't want to do this. I'm taking my glasses off for this. Can we just can we just stop?
[03:05.420 --> 03:09.980]  Oh, why'd you what if I don't do it? Why'd you pick this game? Why'd you do it?
[03:13.820 --> 03:17.560]  God damn it, okay. Oh fuck
[03:18.020 --> 03:18.420]  Oh
[03:20.060 --> 03:25.460]  Do something I'm mashing it. Oh, I gotta go left. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry my dude.
[03:28.800 --> 03:34.240]  It's just it's just okay, we're doing it again. Oh you have to do it for each
[03:36.940 --> 03:40.900]  Wait, what's this? Wait, did I take too long? Wait.
[03:44.340 --> 03:47.780]  I mean, I definitely waited a while. That may have been on me
[03:52.930 --> 03:58.430]  Wait, did I fail? Do we have to do that again? Because I took too long. Please tell me that was supposed to happen
[03:58.430 --> 04:04.110]  I hope there's loads of different scenarios, and it doesn't make you do this again. I don't want to do that again. No!
[04:05.290 --> 04:05.670]  No!
[04:09.810 --> 04:15.890]  Did I skip it? Okay. Okay. I'm just getting it done. Nick. I'm sorry. We gotta do this. I'm taking off again.
[04:15.910 --> 04:19.210]  We gotta do this. Audience. I'm sorry. Oh
[04:19.210 --> 04:20.970]  God, oh god. It's fine. Oh
[04:22.510 --> 04:26.190]  He's great, he's doing great. He doesn't mind this.
[04:27.570 --> 04:35.030]  I guess on the upside, the sutures. You just have to cut the sutures, not the face. Yeah, it's not as bad. Sutures, not face.
[04:36.510 --> 04:43.550]  Sutures or stitchers? Is it sutures? They're stitches, right? Which is a suture, isn't it? I have no idea. Oh, the key!
[04:49.510 --> 04:52.130]  Achievement! Would you like to play a game?
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.520]  The first assassin.
[05:01.080 --> 05:07.660]  The sutures are the threads or materials used to close a wound, while stitches is the process of closing a wound using sutures.
[05:08.260 --> 05:15.460]  How do I? This is fucking really dark. Wow, that is really dark game.
[05:16.340 --> 05:19.460]  No options! That is insane!
[05:20.240 --> 05:21.680]  Look, there's a room that's lit over there.
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.420]  Okay, settings is in this. Oh, what a weird game.
[05:26.420 --> 05:30.540]  Why would it give you a map that shows you that much already?
[05:31.300 --> 05:36.740]  Why? Why do I control my movement speed in the pause setting?
[05:37.760 --> 05:41.500]  What? Walk, run. Have you ever seen?
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.500]  Now off, walk, run.
[05:44.160 --> 05:46.620]  That is that can't be what?
[05:47.660 --> 05:50.140]  I refuse to believe that I'm going to just start running now.
[05:51.160 --> 05:52.480]  You passed the test.
[05:52.540 --> 05:55.360]  This is not how this is not how John Kramer operates.
[05:55.360 --> 05:58.320]  Come on. You're free now.
[06:01.440 --> 06:02.140]  Wait, OK.
[06:03.560 --> 06:05.940]  So this is what I'm moving at with running.
[06:06.160 --> 06:09.500]  OK. Let's see walking settings.
[06:13.220 --> 06:14.200]  That's insane.
[06:14.500 --> 06:15.960]  That is an insane choice.
[06:16.380 --> 06:17.920]  I've never seen a game do that.
[06:18.700 --> 06:21.240]  When you're injured, find a hypodermic needle.
[06:21.560 --> 06:24.860]  Oh, there's no button to sprint.
[06:24.860 --> 06:27.380]  OK, so we choose to walk.
[06:29.220 --> 06:30.720]  Who is doing this?
[06:30.960 --> 06:32.620]  Also, best times.
[06:33.160 --> 06:33.280]  What?
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.040]  Oh, I guess if you just OK.
[06:36.280 --> 06:38.160]  Oh, it's like different puzzles or whatever.
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.800]  Now is the time to take a hard look at yourself, yourself.
[06:43.640 --> 06:45.260]  So do you think this game is going to be scary?
[06:45.420 --> 06:47.560]  I mean, obviously, it's cringing.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.140]  I think it's going to be disturbing at times, but not scary.
[06:54.280 --> 06:56.000]  I don't think I'm going to get spooked.
[06:59.680 --> 07:01.300]  What else is wrong with you?
[07:01.620 --> 07:02.860]  Oh, look close. Look closely.
[07:03.780 --> 07:06.360]  Oh, OK. Oh, I hate it.
[07:06.400 --> 07:08.740]  I got signs in my chest.
[07:09.040 --> 07:10.480]  I'm a big M night guy. Yeah.
[07:11.460 --> 07:14.720]  That was that was pre being captured.
[07:17.160 --> 07:20.120]  Oh, oh, it's it's based off of the thing on your chest.
[07:21.840 --> 07:23.020]  It's got to match the shape.
[07:26.060 --> 07:28.320]  OK, let's look at the chest again.
[07:29.460 --> 07:32.540]  It's a dot at the top and then kind of like a hump dot
[07:32.540 --> 07:36.220]  on the middle line and then and then a dot at the bottom.
[07:36.940 --> 07:38.480]  Oh, I didn't even see that dot. Nice.
[07:40.700 --> 07:43.460]  So this is I asked you before we started this because both of us
[07:43.460 --> 07:45.680]  didn't know if this was a movie tie in.
[07:45.880 --> 07:48.040]  And so far, it seems like not.
[07:50.180 --> 07:52.600]  This character is not someone you recognize.
[07:52.860 --> 07:58.060]  No, but also the location doesn't look familiar either.
[07:58.120 --> 07:59.320]  From like the second movie.
[08:01.720 --> 08:04.520]  I feel like in the sub real, I feel like it wants the.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.060]  I think you need to hit select, which is there you go.
[08:12.590 --> 08:14.010]  Ah, that's it.
[08:14.470 --> 08:17.870]  Got it. Whoa.
[08:19.910 --> 08:21.390]  I like I was.
[08:21.590 --> 08:22.610]  Where did he get this stuff?
[08:23.290 --> 08:25.510]  There's always sort of one of my problems with the movies
[08:25.510 --> 08:27.490]  is that everything feels so elaborate.
[08:27.790 --> 08:30.570]  He was there. Oh, he was like an engineer, I think.
[08:31.290 --> 08:33.310]  Oh, he was. OK, I think so.
[08:35.270 --> 08:36.890]  Oh, sweet. Now it's a Resident Evil game.
[08:40.470 --> 08:42.470]  Jesus, Alexa, let there be light.
[08:42.730 --> 08:44.870]  You have a flashlight that can be used to illuminate dark areas.
[08:44.990 --> 08:46.290]  Press Y to turn it on and off.
[08:47.090 --> 08:51.070]  I was expecting it to say hit select and go into your settings to determine
[08:51.590 --> 08:54.590]  want to use it. What is it?
[08:54.590 --> 08:57.130]  My Amazon Echo just scared the show. Oh.
[08:58.150 --> 08:59.490]  What a little preview.
[09:00.910 --> 09:02.850]  A little taste of maybe what's to come.
[09:04.310 --> 09:05.450]  Vice Crusher.
[09:06.470 --> 09:09.430]  Oh, oh, a little crush action.
[09:11.430 --> 09:13.810]  Oh, five, seven, three.
[09:14.610 --> 09:16.750]  You can see what do you understand?
[09:19.190 --> 09:20.570]  Campbell. Oh, you are Campbell.
[09:21.930 --> 09:24.830]  Now, that is a trap from the first.
[09:24.950 --> 09:26.810]  That is like the most iconic one, right?
[09:26.870 --> 09:29.750]  The reverse bear trap. Yeah, it was.
[09:31.190 --> 09:33.950]  What the main one of the main characters from the second movie
[09:33.950 --> 09:37.550]  had in the first movie, Amanda, I think is her character's name.
[09:39.210 --> 09:41.370]  I don't know how I remember that she was also in.
[09:41.970 --> 09:45.070]  Do you remember the Ted Danson show, Becker?
[09:46.890 --> 09:48.590]  I remember it was a thing.
[09:48.690 --> 09:50.690]  I can't tell you anything specific about Becker.
[09:50.950 --> 09:54.690]  I think I think she worked in his office in that show.
[09:55.290 --> 09:57.830]  So it was kind of weird to see her in that movie.
[09:58.610 --> 10:04.190]  But it's also weird because the dude who owns the coffee shop in Gilmore Girls
[10:04.190 --> 10:06.590]  is like a detective in.
[10:07.750 --> 10:10.350]  I want to say starting in that the second movie.
[10:10.350 --> 10:12.470]  Oh. Oh, shit.
[10:12.670 --> 10:14.930]  Sorry. Keep going about Gilmore Girls.
[10:16.490 --> 10:21.910]  Yeah, the the guy who was in that movie suddenly pops up as a
[10:21.910 --> 10:24.590]  as a detective in this series.
[10:24.750 --> 10:26.670]  So it was weird to see all these wholesome people.
[10:27.990 --> 10:30.150]  Being like, that's really funny.
[10:30.450 --> 10:32.450]  Well, and then Danny Glover was in the first one.
[10:32.570 --> 10:37.530]  And then that's the first time I ever remember seeing the guy from Lost.
[10:37.950 --> 10:38.770]  Yeah, Ben. Yeah.
[10:39.210 --> 10:40.450]  I think Michael Emerson.
[10:40.970 --> 10:42.970]  Yeah, I I don't remember ever. Oh.
[10:44.070 --> 10:45.730]  What even is that trap?
[10:46.230 --> 10:47.370]  Oh, like swung down.
[10:48.190 --> 10:52.130]  OK. Always slowly opened.
[10:54.270 --> 10:55.570]  I have a game.
[10:56.070 --> 10:57.610]  Always knock before going in.
[10:59.510 --> 11:01.210]  He walked in on me once.
[11:01.390 --> 11:02.290]  Not again.
[11:03.030 --> 11:04.070]  I will teach you a lesson.
[11:05.170 --> 11:06.570]  What does occupied mean to you?
[11:06.570 --> 11:08.450]  Oh, right, right, right, Eric.
[11:12.350 --> 11:14.430]  What a necessary quick time event.
[11:16.130 --> 11:16.850]  Wait, what?
[11:17.830 --> 11:19.570]  No, no, you got to knock.
[11:19.930 --> 11:21.350]  You got to knock. Trust me.
[11:22.270 --> 11:24.690]  I just thought you're going to get killed if you don't knock.
[11:25.250 --> 11:26.350]  Got a knock, bro.
[11:28.610 --> 11:30.630]  Oh, it's in here. Oh.
[11:31.710 --> 11:33.450]  Well, on the wall, I can't.
[11:34.310 --> 11:36.050]  No knob, no dog in there.
[11:38.530 --> 11:39.730]  Oh, really, you're not just
[11:40.310 --> 11:41.630]  oh, the rat.
[11:41.930 --> 11:46.030]  Oh, this is a rat game and we didn't even know it.
[11:47.930 --> 11:48.930]  We're going to save.
[11:49.390 --> 11:50.650]  So this is a ratatouille spin off, yeah?
[11:51.410 --> 11:54.010]  Oh yeah, this is absolutely in line.
[11:54.330 --> 11:56.850]  Remy, no Remy is going to be here any minute now.
[11:58.230 --> 11:59.350]  He's going to be cooking you up.
[12:00.390 --> 12:00.890]  Puzzle piece.
[12:01.050 --> 12:02.790]  Oh, hell yeah.
[12:05.730 --> 12:08.550]  Uh. I want to knock.
[12:08.890 --> 12:11.270]  Start with the corner is a valuable lesson for y'all's competition.
[12:11.570 --> 12:13.570]  Wait, what? Oh, what?
[12:14.090 --> 12:15.310]  What? What is happening?
[12:15.590 --> 12:17.410]  What is that? Oh, that's the.
[12:17.490 --> 12:18.290]  Oh, I got to go through it.
[12:18.750 --> 12:19.830]  OK. All right.
[12:19.830 --> 12:20.330]  So left.
[12:26.220 --> 12:27.420]  What an insane.
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.120]  Have you ever seen a lockpick mechanic like this?
[12:30.480 --> 12:32.620]  What an insane thing.
[12:32.700 --> 12:35.160]  It's like your eyes like slithering through the hole.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.260]  It's a superpower.
[12:40.200 --> 12:41.820]  Uh, history repeats itself.
[12:41.940 --> 12:42.680]  OK, we got to knock.
[12:43.560 --> 12:45.740]  Oh, there was a there was a dude in red who just walked through that door.
[12:47.340 --> 12:47.700]  Which one?
[12:48.060 --> 12:48.760]  This one behind you.
[12:49.260 --> 12:50.020]  I saw like his.
[12:50.600 --> 12:51.980]  Oh, just for like a split second.
[12:53.520 --> 12:54.540]  History repeats itself.
[12:54.720 --> 12:55.580]  OK, knock button.
[12:56.520 --> 12:57.500]  Oh, we got to knock.
[12:57.580 --> 12:58.120]  We got to knock.
[12:58.600 --> 12:59.900]  Oh, I hit X.
[13:00.560 --> 13:02.220]  Oh, this piece of shit.
[13:04.160 --> 13:05.080]  Oh, fuck you.
[13:05.560 --> 13:06.520]  Thank you for laughing.
[13:06.520 --> 13:07.700]  I hit X.
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.020]  Man, he's going to mash it, maybe.
[13:10.940 --> 13:13.880]  I think that laugh box is the definition of a chuckle fuck.
[13:15.200 --> 13:16.400]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[13:19.760 --> 13:21.660]  Make sure we follow the rules.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.720]  Oh, it's from Saw 5.
[13:25.620 --> 13:28.860]  Oh, so this came out later than this is not weird.
[13:30.460 --> 13:36.500]  Wouldn't you be worried about Saw, Saw 2 and just the connection to all of them?
[13:37.120 --> 13:38.160]  Probably, yeah.
[13:38.300 --> 13:42.240]  You would think I'd turn my stupid light on.
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.400]  I just unlocked this again.
[13:43.620 --> 13:45.260]  Excellent. Oh my God.
[13:45.300 --> 13:46.680]  Maybe unlock it and save it again.
[13:49.900 --> 13:52.640]  Oh, OK, so I've been holding right trigger
[13:52.640 --> 13:55.780]  thinking that speed right trigger meant go fast.
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.120]  That actually means slow down.
[13:57.520 --> 13:58.060]  Oh, there we go.
[13:59.160 --> 14:00.060]  That's who you're talking about.
[14:00.120 --> 14:01.080]  I don't see any of this.
[14:01.900 --> 14:04.700]  I just saw like, hey, Pigman, that frame.
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.720]  That's honestly probably all you should have seen.
[14:08.820 --> 14:10.300]  That is creepier than what they did.
[14:10.900 --> 14:11.860]  It repeats itself.
[14:11.980 --> 14:12.800]  OK, I got it.
[14:12.860 --> 14:13.440]  I got it.
[14:13.500 --> 14:14.060]  This time.
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.840]  B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B.
[14:17.940 --> 14:20.040]  Oh, I thought I still fucked it up somehow.
[14:20.620 --> 14:22.820]  Well, it sure played the same way.
[14:24.300 --> 14:25.800]  Yeah, it was essentially the same animation.
[14:25.960 --> 14:30.020]  I like that he also just trusted that to stay there as opposed to like going.
[14:30.260 --> 14:31.780]  Yeah, it would come back down. Yeah.
[14:31.780 --> 14:32.660]  Uh.
[14:36.520 --> 14:38.820]  Oh, whoa, man.
[14:39.860 --> 14:41.320]  Fuck door sealed.
[14:42.920 --> 14:43.560]  What is that?
[14:43.820 --> 14:45.720]  Oh, for God's sake.
[14:47.060 --> 14:48.200]  Everything's falling apart.
[14:50.240 --> 14:51.500]  Finally, some light.
[14:52.740 --> 14:54.980]  Oh, for your life to alter your movement speed.
[14:55.100 --> 14:55.600]  Hold OK.
[14:55.700 --> 14:59.080]  So there is a button that will make some events more difficult to survive.
[14:59.080 --> 15:02.880]  I don't... okay.
[15:03.200 --> 15:04.220]  What the hell does that mean?
[15:04.900 --> 15:06.340]  I have no idea, Nick.
[15:06.960 --> 15:08.220]  You mean running on a balance beam?
[15:09.460 --> 15:10.100]  Oh, maybe.
[15:11.540 --> 15:13.680]  Just full sprinting on a balance beam.
[15:14.180 --> 15:14.980]  Oh, do you need to go up?
[15:16.840 --> 15:23.840]  The ladder thing with that gave me a bit of Alan Wake 2 vibes in the theater alleyway.
[15:24.460 --> 15:25.320]  Oh, yeah.
[15:27.020 --> 15:30.560]  I mean, a lot of people compare the Saw 2 game to Alan Wake 2.
[15:32.220 --> 15:34.680]  Well, they both have a 2 in the title.
[15:35.520 --> 15:36.320]  That's true.
[15:37.200 --> 15:38.260]  And watch your step.
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.000]  Oh.
[15:45.180 --> 15:49.200]  Isn't that one of the Gyarados things from Resident Evil 4?
[15:50.420 --> 15:51.380]  Silent Hill?
[15:52.800 --> 15:54.400]  Oh, dude, I'm excited for Silent Hill 2.
[15:56.220 --> 15:57.720]  Yeah, I never really played any of them.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.260]  I hope it's good. I know, like, it's...
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.500]  People didn't seem to love the first trailer, but then later ones seemed a little bit better.
[16:06.200 --> 16:08.640]  Defeat the Rammer? What the fuck?
[16:09.960 --> 16:15.640]  What does this possibly... like, what did this man do that this needs to be his lesson?
[16:16.840 --> 16:17.620]  Fuck you!
[16:18.220 --> 16:20.240]  He was a juggernaut impersonator.
[16:20.620 --> 16:21.540]  What am I supposed to do?
[16:23.020 --> 16:24.580]  Oh, sh... I don't...
[16:24.580 --> 16:24.760]  Oh.
[16:25.660 --> 16:27.420]  Maybe get behind him once he hits the wall?
[16:28.780 --> 16:30.060]  That's what I... nope.
[16:30.980 --> 16:34.020]  Oh no! Oh, tell me that the checkpoint's right here.
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.180]  Please, for the love of God, do not send me back to the save.
[16:39.840 --> 16:42.340]  Do not send me back to the manual save.
[16:44.260 --> 16:48.900]  That would be the most vicious, sadistic, torturous move of all.
[16:49.900 --> 16:51.780]  Bring me back...
[16:51.780 --> 16:52.800]  Okay. Okay.
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.360]  We felt very... unsure.
[16:57.080 --> 16:58.960]  And we're just gonna hit the thing.
[17:01.120 --> 17:02.800]  So how do we...
[17:05.510 --> 17:10.410]  He was in front of me in the grocery store at the self-checkout and he was taking too long.
[17:10.930 --> 17:12.250]  Took up too much space.
[17:14.950 --> 17:16.810]  He's learned to be small.
[17:22.570 --> 17:24.150]  No man can define gravity.
[17:24.150 --> 17:26.410]  Okay, we gotta send him down the hole.
[17:28.350 --> 17:30.010]  What the fu... Oh my God!
[17:30.990 --> 17:32.690]  How did he turn on a dime?
[17:32.970 --> 17:34.710]  How did he turn on a dime like that?
[17:34.910 --> 17:36.070]  What the fuck?
[17:37.790 --> 17:38.690]  No! Okay.
[17:38.970 --> 17:40.470]  I'm the juggernaut bin.
[17:42.290 --> 17:44.930]  Nick, for a moment I thought he said that. I didn't really...
[17:44.930 --> 17:46.370]  I thought that that was in-game.
[17:46.370 --> 17:47.630]  That's it.
[17:49.610 --> 17:50.990]  He is running like that.
[17:52.170 --> 17:54.110]  Oh man. Vinnie Jones.
[17:54.270 --> 17:54.830]  Vinnie Jones.
[17:55.330 --> 17:55.930]  What a career.
[17:57.890 --> 17:59.750]  Man, that movie was not good.
[18:01.090 --> 18:02.130]  No, it wasn't.
[18:03.830 --> 18:07.330]  What a shame. X2 is still such a good movie.
[18:07.450 --> 18:07.790]  So cool.
[18:09.630 --> 18:11.070]  Can I skip this? Yeah. Okay.
[18:11.630 --> 18:13.170]  And you know, the original X-Men is fine.
[18:15.390 --> 18:16.030]  But...
[18:16.030 --> 18:18.390]  But 2 is insanely good.
[18:19.750 --> 18:21.290]  Oh my God.
[18:21.850 --> 18:22.930]  He can just zigzag.
[18:23.450 --> 18:24.610]  Okay, let's go again.
[18:25.870 --> 18:27.530]  Okay, I gotta hit this.
[18:27.950 --> 18:28.370]  Oh God!
[18:29.570 --> 18:31.170]  Oh, come on!
[18:33.210 --> 18:34.810]  Please don't close the door.
[18:35.930 --> 18:37.530]  Over here. X3
[18:37.530 --> 18:38.990]  Oh shit!
[18:39.270 --> 18:40.110]  Oh shit!
[18:43.450 --> 18:44.650]  Oh, come on!
[18:44.930 --> 18:45.690]  Come on, you prick.
[18:46.750 --> 18:48.570]  Stop it. X2
[18:50.050 --> 18:51.190]  Oh shit.
[18:51.470 --> 18:51.870]  Okay.
[18:54.410 --> 18:56.290]  I got caught in the box.
[18:56.870 --> 18:58.630]  The box, the most deadly enemy.
[18:59.430 --> 19:00.350]  Oh my God, what the hell?
[19:01.010 --> 19:02.090]  His hands are free.
[19:04.970 --> 19:06.630]  Come on. X3
[19:07.110 --> 19:07.410]  No!
[19:07.410 --> 19:09.230]  You bailed too fast.
[19:11.590 --> 19:12.310]  Okay.
[19:13.170 --> 19:13.970]  I'm gonna wait.
[19:16.630 --> 19:17.670]  Oh my God!
[19:17.690 --> 19:18.570]  Was I not lined up?
[19:19.090 --> 19:20.450]  Maybe stand right in the middle.
[19:21.530 --> 19:21.910]  That's what I'm doing.
[19:23.410 --> 19:25.270]  He never stopped running!
[19:27.990 --> 19:30.230]  The real Sonic the Hedgehog, that guy.
[19:31.450 --> 19:32.170]  Yeah.
[19:33.030 --> 19:35.910]  Moving around at the speed of sound.
[19:35.910 --> 19:37.570]  Places to go.
[19:37.790 --> 19:39.370]  Gotta follow my rainbow.
[19:40.390 --> 19:41.430]  What a song.
[19:42.530 --> 19:45.450]  I was playing that level and I was like,
[19:45.530 --> 19:47.250]  what the hell is happening? What is this?
[19:50.150 --> 19:52.290]  Did you ever play Dead Rising?
[19:53.190 --> 19:53.830]  Yes.
[19:54.370 --> 19:56.210]  I started playing the remaster
[19:56.210 --> 19:57.310]  the other day.
[19:57.850 --> 19:59.390]  And the
[19:59.910 --> 20:01.890]  rap song when the prisoners
[20:01.890 --> 20:03.470]  are driving around in the jeep.
[20:03.470 --> 20:05.310]  That's another one of those
[20:05.310 --> 20:07.430]  for me where it's just burnt into my brain.
[20:10.090 --> 20:10.610]  Okay.
[20:12.770 --> 20:15.030]  I remember a lot of Conker's Bad Fur Day.
[20:15.670 --> 20:16.190]  Stupid.
[20:16.750 --> 20:17.890]  The Great Mighty Poo.
[20:18.930 --> 20:20.250]  I never played this.
[20:21.950 --> 20:23.190]  I remember thinking
[20:23.190 --> 20:24.710]  it was hilarious when I was a kid.
[20:25.870 --> 20:27.390]  That, I mean tracks.
[20:27.510 --> 20:28.910]  I feel like that is a game for
[20:28.910 --> 20:30.890]  a very specific age demographic.
[20:30.890 --> 20:31.770]  Yeah.
[20:33.330 --> 20:34.050]  There we go.
[20:34.390 --> 20:36.270]  This is impossible.
[20:39.430 --> 20:40.710]  Not only do you have to
[20:40.710 --> 20:42.770]  eviscerate yourself, you have to kill another man to
[20:42.770 --> 20:43.490]  get out of this.
[20:46.880 --> 20:47.720]  There we go!
[20:52.620 --> 20:53.540]  Stupid animation.
[20:54.900 --> 20:56.260]  It didn't even look like he fell
[20:56.260 --> 20:57.520]  that far. Oh, okay, he did.
[20:58.300 --> 21:00.220]  He ain't gonna be in Saw III.
[21:02.260 --> 21:03.540]  Turns out, nobody will.
[21:04.200 --> 21:06.280]  Yeah, this studio, I don't
[21:06.280 --> 21:07.380]  think exists anymore.
[21:11.220 --> 21:13.340]  I'd love to know, I think they made this game
[21:13.340 --> 21:15.160]  and the one before it and
[21:16.060 --> 21:17.260]  that might be it.
[21:18.220 --> 21:18.740]  That's a shame.
[21:19.380 --> 21:21.680]  It is a shame. I mean, it looks like
[21:21.680 --> 21:22.820]  it could actually be fun.
[21:23.760 --> 21:23.960]  Maybe.
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.680]  Yeah, it looks like it for sure.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.120]  Okay. A coupler.
[21:29.560 --> 21:30.180]  A coupler?
[21:31.720 --> 21:32.480]  I think
[21:32.480 --> 21:33.920]  what you brought up is really
[21:34.840 --> 21:35.600]  more... Oh.
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.040]  I'm expecting everything to be a trap.
[21:38.720 --> 21:38.940]  Yeah.
[21:41.120 --> 21:41.980]  What you brought up
[21:41.980 --> 21:43.820]  would be more fun of like
[21:43.820 --> 21:46.180]  you don't really want to do this in a Saw game.
[21:46.320 --> 21:47.880]  You want to be doing traps.
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.240]  I think we're
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.740]  gonna have to mess with the... Oh, nope.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.040]  I thought we were gonna have to do like a
[21:54.040 --> 21:56.140]  lock combo. I saw that the other
[21:56.140 --> 21:58.180]  clock was four. This one is...
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.640]  I'll be back to it for you.
[22:02.560 --> 22:03.820]  Where is it? Where's the... Oh.
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.180]  Right there. Four, nine...
[22:07.780 --> 22:08.240]  Okay, well
[22:08.240 --> 22:09.400]  you lock in on these clocks.
[22:09.840 --> 22:12.060]  Okay. I got you.
[22:13.480 --> 22:14.220]  Oh, there's another
[22:14.220 --> 22:15.600]  one. Four, nine, three.
[22:20.460 --> 22:20.920]  Oh, sweet.
[22:23.660 --> 22:24.680]  Four, nine, three.
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.140]  Danger, danger, high voltage.
[22:32.300 --> 22:33.580]  Oh, okay.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.720]  One of these. Oh.
[22:36.340 --> 22:38.320]  So that's not anything to do
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.440]  with the clocks at all.
[22:40.580 --> 22:41.840]  It doesn't look like it.
[22:48.970 --> 22:49.610]  Okay.
[22:53.030 --> 22:53.510]  Ah.
[22:56.610 --> 22:57.890]  I don't...
[22:57.890 --> 22:58.970]  Oh, because it's red.
[22:58.970 --> 22:59.350]  Ah.
[23:06.100 --> 23:07.720]  Thrilling Saw gameplay!
[23:08.480 --> 23:09.380]  Oh, man.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.580]  This is actually
[23:11.580 --> 23:12.880]  giving me Resident Evil vibes, though.
[23:17.340 --> 23:18.300]  I don't...
[23:18.300 --> 23:20.160]  I don't think you've connected
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.120]  anything to anything. Nope, sure
[23:22.120 --> 23:22.620]  haven't.
[23:24.600 --> 23:26.200]  I'm trying to figure out where
[23:26.940 --> 23:28.260]  it... It looks like
[23:28.260 --> 23:30.160]  it needs to go from... Oh.
[23:30.160 --> 23:32.240]  Oh. Oh, now I get it.
[23:32.240 --> 23:33.180]  Okay, now, yeah.
[23:33.940 --> 23:35.020]  I was doing it backwards.
[23:36.460 --> 23:38.400]  I thought we were trying to take it from the sides
[23:38.400 --> 23:40.280]  to the middle, not from the...
[23:41.380 --> 23:41.640]  Okay.
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.040]  I fucking...
[23:52.040 --> 23:52.920]  Oh my god, this game.
[23:55.260 --> 23:56.240]  Okay, so it has to be
[23:56.240 --> 23:56.460]  yellow.
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.820]  I mean, okay.
[24:04.180 --> 24:05.340]  Well, can you not...
[24:05.340 --> 24:06.820]  Can you turn the thing on the right?
[24:06.900 --> 24:07.760]  I don't think you can, can you?
[24:08.640 --> 24:10.500]  The top right. Can you turn that?
[24:10.980 --> 24:11.440]  Top right?
[24:12.360 --> 24:14.460]  Yeah, because then you could just close the top...
[24:16.360 --> 24:16.760]  middle.
[24:17.980 --> 24:18.840]  And that's done.
[24:20.260 --> 24:20.660]  I...
[24:20.660 --> 24:22.580]  Okay, I did not understand
[24:22.580 --> 24:23.700]  I was trying to get to that.
[24:24.120 --> 24:24.480]  Yeah.
[24:25.300 --> 24:26.880]  I assume that's what you're trying to do.
[24:27.040 --> 24:28.540]  You are absolutely right.
[24:31.680 --> 24:33.340]  Okay, so now I gotta move this
[24:33.340 --> 24:34.320]  and then do that.
[24:34.500 --> 24:36.660]  And then done. Nice job.
[24:37.980 --> 24:39.520]  I thought I was trying to get it to
[24:39.520 --> 24:40.980]  the side breaker things.
[24:41.300 --> 24:42.260]  I didn't realize the buttons.
[24:43.100 --> 24:45.420]  That's what I thought at first, too, because I saw where the cables were.
[24:45.460 --> 24:46.140]  Oh, 493.
[24:49.850 --> 24:51.030]  Oh, they're color-coded, though.
[24:51.050 --> 24:51.790]  I wonder if that's right.
[24:53.030 --> 24:54.030]  Ah, okay.
[24:54.210 --> 24:55.770]  Okay, we'll have to go back and see what the...
[24:55.770 --> 24:57.230]  Oh, I bet it's based on the room color.
[24:58.310 --> 24:58.710]  Okay.
[24:59.950 --> 25:01.490]  Okay, so not that one.
[25:02.510 --> 25:04.130]  It was... there's one in here
[25:04.130 --> 25:06.090]  in the... through the gate, which is green.
[25:06.730 --> 25:07.870]  Which was three.
[25:08.210 --> 25:08.990]  So green is three.
[25:10.730 --> 25:12.130]  And then through that door,
[25:12.250 --> 25:13.150]  which is red.
[25:13.270 --> 25:14.510]  So red is four.
[25:15.750 --> 25:17.450]  Okay. Oh wait, no, that's green.
[25:19.090 --> 25:20.110]  So green is nine,
[25:20.110 --> 25:22.310]  red is four, and then whatever's left can be three.
[25:22.330 --> 25:22.490]  Yeah.
[25:23.770 --> 25:25.390]  Red is four, green is nine.
[25:25.490 --> 25:26.730]  Red is four, green is nine.
[25:27.730 --> 25:28.550]  Blue is three.
[25:33.610 --> 25:35.490]  Uh, red is...
[25:36.030 --> 25:37.830]  four, green is nine.
[25:39.610 --> 25:40.750]  Hell yeah, Nick!
[25:40.910 --> 25:41.730]  Hell yeah.
[25:42.230 --> 25:44.850]  I bet you the code for blue is over here.
[25:45.970 --> 25:47.850]  I think it was in that other...
[25:47.850 --> 25:48.430]  Oh.
[25:48.710 --> 25:50.730]  Oh no, okay, maybe...
[25:50.730 --> 25:52.730]  Let me go back, let me just see what was in here.
[25:57.830 --> 25:58.790]  Billy Puppet!
[26:00.590 --> 26:01.070]  Oh!
[26:02.490 --> 26:03.730]  A single puppet exists in each
[26:03.730 --> 26:05.690]  area for you to find. They are locked away using
[26:05.690 --> 26:07.590]  Jigsaw's most devious
[26:07.590 --> 26:09.650]  puzzles. Nick, that was one of his most
[26:09.650 --> 26:10.890]  devious puzzles you just solved.
[26:11.150 --> 26:13.530]  Well, he tricked me right nice with those clocks.
[26:19.780 --> 26:20.960]  Motherfucker, you had them
[26:20.960 --> 26:21.680]  before us.
[26:22.620 --> 26:23.760]  You made the
[26:23.760 --> 26:26.080]  collectible. What are you talking about?
[26:27.400 --> 26:30.080]  Maybe he was just talking to the gamer in me.
[26:32.120 --> 26:33.180]  Oh, there.
[26:33.420 --> 26:34.140]  It is a blue room.
[26:34.400 --> 26:36.820]  I thought it was green. I'm an idiot.
[26:37.300 --> 26:39.600]  No, well listen, I didn't even see the clock until then
[26:39.600 --> 26:41.580]  in that space. Put on some
[26:41.580 --> 26:43.020]  pounds, okay.
[26:45.600 --> 26:46.080]  Okay.
[26:47.520 --> 26:48.860]  How do we...
[26:48.860 --> 26:50.400]  Can you bring that cart over here?
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.100]  Oh, yeah. Good idea, good idea.
[26:59.010 --> 27:00.530]  I'm a puzzle guy like Eric.
[27:01.850 --> 27:02.910]  Oh, mash A.
[27:08.280 --> 27:09.900]  I'm trying to remember when...
[27:10.900 --> 27:12.080]  What year the Saw movies
[27:12.080 --> 27:12.680]  came out?
[27:17.930 --> 27:18.410]  2005.
[27:21.810 --> 27:23.650]  I met the Jigsaw killer and I let him escape.
[27:23.750 --> 27:25.770]  His price was too high and I was too weak.
[27:26.330 --> 27:27.890]  Jigsaw was holding Gordon's family
[27:27.890 --> 27:29.270]  hostage at gunpoint. Commissioner?
[27:30.130 --> 27:31.630]  Yeah, it is. This is a Batman game.
[27:32.050 --> 27:33.770]  And I ran over to respond. If I hadn't been in the
[27:33.770 --> 27:35.390]  next building, I don't know what would have happened.
[27:35.830 --> 27:37.410]  We had a shootout in Gordon's apartment.
[27:37.810 --> 27:39.570]  Then Jigsaw escaped and I gave chase.
[27:40.130 --> 27:41.810]  Jigsaw was a short man with brown
[27:41.810 --> 27:43.250]  hair, large blue eyes.
[27:43.770 --> 27:45.910]  I gave a render to the officer that found
[27:45.910 --> 27:47.210]  me after I was released
[27:47.590 --> 27:49.930]  from that hellhole. Whitehurst.
[27:50.250 --> 27:51.450]  Jigsaw trapped me there.
[27:51.730 --> 27:53.650]  He did horrible things.
[27:53.650 --> 27:55.250]  In the end, he made me choose.
[27:55.510 --> 27:57.290]  Give up chasing him so that others may live,
[27:57.490 --> 27:59.590]  or continue pursuit and watch them die.
[27:59.910 --> 28:01.670]  I gave up the chase. I don't know if I made
[28:01.670 --> 28:02.330]  the right choice.
[28:03.630 --> 28:05.610]  Is that supposed to be...
[28:05.610 --> 28:07.290]  Wouldn't he still watch them die?
[28:07.670 --> 28:08.870]  One of fifty?
[28:09.550 --> 28:10.990]  There are fifty of those?
[28:12.370 --> 28:13.470]  That doesn't make sense
[28:13.470 --> 28:14.870]  because everything else is like
[28:15.620 --> 28:17.550]  seven. One of seven. One of twenty.
[28:17.870 --> 28:19.610]  One of fifty? Escape
[28:19.610 --> 28:20.370]  Jigsaw's game?
[28:20.370 --> 28:20.490]  Hmm?
[28:22.250 --> 28:23.850]  Oh, did you just start a new one?
[28:23.990 --> 28:26.050]  I think so. Here we go.
[28:27.430 --> 28:27.850]  Oh!
[28:28.250 --> 28:28.890]  What's up?
[28:30.550 --> 28:32.410]  Oh, that was the bull guy from before,
[28:32.530 --> 28:34.190]  wasn't it? The bull?
[28:36.050 --> 28:36.490]  Well...
[28:36.490 --> 28:37.730]  It was, maybe.
[28:39.250 --> 28:40.350]  I see how many times we
[28:40.350 --> 28:41.350]  encounter the bull guy.
[28:45.070 --> 28:48.690]  Oh, this looks like a rule room.
[28:49.290 --> 28:50.250]  Tell me the rules.
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.660]  Wait, what? I have cancer?
[29:06.760 --> 29:06.920]  What?
[29:10.120 --> 29:11.680]  I mean, that doesn't seem bad.
[29:18.390 --> 29:19.010]  Wait, he's
[29:19.010 --> 29:19.670]  cancer-free?
[29:22.930 --> 29:23.330]  Oh!
[29:24.610 --> 29:26.850]  This is a tie-in to the second movie, I think.
[29:27.210 --> 29:27.990]  Oh, it is? Okay.
[29:27.990 --> 29:29.230]  Yeah, I saw it too.
[29:32.230 --> 29:32.870]  Rats!
[29:37.020 --> 29:37.660]  Oh,
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  okay. More rats.
[29:39.580 --> 29:40.940]  So he's like the main detective
[29:41.940 --> 29:43.360]  in the second movie.
[29:44.180 --> 29:45.160]  Donnie Wahlberg?
[29:46.860 --> 29:47.780]  Are we
[29:47.780 --> 29:49.420]  supposed to be Donnie Wahlberg right now?
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.800]  Oh, no.
[29:54.880 --> 29:56.380]  Is he not?
[29:56.380 --> 29:58.280]  Oh, no. Never mind.
[29:58.860 --> 29:59.620]  It's not him.
[30:16.540 --> 30:17.580]  I think we should let
[30:17.580 --> 30:18.500]  this guy live, Nick.
[30:19.360 --> 30:20.260]  Which one?
[30:21.040 --> 30:22.940]  We're going to sacrifice, I think, right?
[30:23.020 --> 30:24.240]  We'll let this guy live.
[30:26.340 --> 30:26.840]  Uh...
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.460]  Yeah.
[30:30.020 --> 30:30.520]  Huh.
[30:37.380 --> 30:38.380]  End credits.
[30:42.460 --> 30:43.000]  Restart?
[30:45.920 --> 30:46.960]  What do I want?
[30:47.060 --> 30:48.400]  I want to play a game.
[30:52.830 --> 30:53.910]  How long
[30:53.910 --> 30:55.890]  do you think this game is?
[30:56.670 --> 30:57.750]  Probably five
[30:57.750 --> 30:58.750]  hours, I would assume.
[31:00.150 --> 31:01.510]  You want to look up how long to beat
[31:01.510 --> 31:02.170]  Saw 2?
[31:04.570 --> 31:05.650]  How long
[31:05.650 --> 31:07.950]  to beat Saw 2?
[31:09.770 --> 31:11.630]  Oh, what the?
[31:12.250 --> 31:12.490]  What?
[31:12.490 --> 31:12.710]  What?
[31:14.750 --> 31:15.230]  What?
[31:17.430 --> 31:19.710]  Is this Silent Hill The Room?
[31:19.870 --> 31:20.990]  What the hell is going on?
[31:23.050 --> 31:24.410]  I'm so confused.
[31:25.570 --> 31:26.210]  Did we
[31:26.210 --> 31:26.930]  complete it?
[31:28.330 --> 31:29.970]  Were we supposed to die?
[31:34.710 --> 31:35.670]  Oh, I...
[31:36.230 --> 31:37.550]  Nick, give me the insights.
[31:37.710 --> 31:39.510]  Is the Saw guy between the two of us...
[31:39.510 --> 31:40.290]  What is happening?
[31:40.770 --> 31:42.650]  Hold on, I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see here.
[31:43.170 --> 31:44.570]  That's the introduction to the game.
[31:46.830 --> 31:47.330]  Oh.
[31:49.650 --> 31:50.790]  That makes sense.
[31:53.290 --> 31:53.810]  Oh.
[31:54.590 --> 31:55.110]  Oh.
[31:57.930 --> 31:59.490]  Apparently you can make it through
[31:59.490 --> 32:00.090]  that section.
[32:02.310 --> 32:03.730]  Oh, nope.
[32:03.730 --> 32:04.110]  Oh.
[32:07.190 --> 32:09.350]  Oh, I guess you die no matter what.
[32:14.320 --> 32:14.800]  Wow.
[32:18.880 --> 32:19.820]  I believe in you.
[32:19.820 --> 32:21.840]  I don't know who you've become
[32:21.840 --> 32:23.820]  now. Yeah, I don't know why we're
[32:23.820 --> 32:25.180]  first person for this.
[32:26.200 --> 32:28.180]  I feel like we must be a recognizable
[32:28.180 --> 32:29.860]  character. There's no other
[32:29.860 --> 32:30.180]  reason.
[32:36.340 --> 32:37.940]  I'm tap. Is that...
[32:42.920 --> 32:43.840]  Oh, I'm
[32:43.840 --> 32:44.940]  the son now.
[32:46.460 --> 32:47.560]  That's what's happening.
[32:48.040 --> 32:49.600]  We're playing my dad, I think.
[32:56.500 --> 32:57.860]  Fucking Riddler here?
[33:04.830 --> 33:06.710]  I mean, this is...
[33:06.710 --> 33:08.410]  It wasn't a great third person
[33:08.410 --> 33:10.310]  game. This is a horrendous first.
[33:10.310 --> 33:12.230]  Oh, David
[33:12.230 --> 33:12.650]  Tap.
[33:15.030 --> 33:16.290]  Sorry, Tap?
[33:17.170 --> 33:18.210]  David Tap
[33:19.110 --> 33:19.770]  was
[33:21.530 --> 33:22.190]  the...
[33:23.190 --> 33:24.370]  He was the
[33:24.370 --> 33:25.930]  Danny Glover character from the first movie.
[33:26.250 --> 33:27.830]  Oh, I'm Danny Glover's son?
[33:28.450 --> 33:30.010]  Apparently so.
[33:30.190 --> 33:31.370]  That's fucking awesome.
[33:32.490 --> 33:33.310]  Okay, I'm back in.
[33:33.990 --> 33:35.670]  Is this deep
[33:36.430 --> 33:37.370]  lore here?
[33:41.870 --> 33:43.070]  Now we're
[33:43.070 --> 33:44.330]  third. I don't know why.
[33:45.690 --> 33:46.710]  I guess it was
[33:46.710 --> 33:48.610]  supposed to be a big reveal of what
[33:48.610 --> 33:50.110]  Danny Glover's son looks like?
[33:51.190 --> 33:52.590]  I guess so.
[33:54.290 --> 33:55.990]  Oh, I think we're about to get trapped.
[33:56.490 --> 33:56.750]  Yup!
[33:57.650 --> 33:58.250]  Pigman!
[34:00.190 --> 34:01.210]  But why?
[34:04.950 --> 34:06.510]  Tap, you're a smoker.
[34:07.090 --> 34:07.610]  Do needles
[34:08.770 --> 34:09.570]  needles work
[34:09.570 --> 34:10.530]  that way?
[34:10.990 --> 34:13.670]  Is that a thing? Can you do that to somebody
[34:13.670 --> 34:14.290]  in real life?
[34:15.190 --> 34:16.850]  Oh, I don't want to think about it. I hate needles.
[34:17.170 --> 34:19.590]  That's fair. Listen, we don't have to go deep into that.
[34:19.710 --> 34:21.350]  I just... I don't know if that...
[34:21.350 --> 34:23.130]  You see that happen all the time
[34:23.130 --> 34:24.030]  in movies.
[34:24.690 --> 34:27.550]  I don't know if that's an actual...
[34:27.550 --> 34:28.370]  how real life works.
[34:28.990 --> 34:31.710]  I think that's more accurate than something like
[34:33.510 --> 34:33.910]  Chloroform.
[34:33.970 --> 34:35.030]  The way they depict it.
[34:35.030 --> 34:36.970]  Because I think I remember reading that
[34:36.970 --> 34:39.030]  Chloroform does
[34:39.030 --> 34:41.230]  nothing unless you completely block
[34:41.230 --> 34:43.250]  the airway, and even then
[34:43.950 --> 34:45.170]  it only lasts as
[34:45.170 --> 34:46.710]  long as it's in place, I think.
[34:47.550 --> 34:49.090]  So like, once you take it away
[34:49.770 --> 34:51.030]  you're back. You're like
[34:51.030 --> 34:51.850]  conscious again.
[34:52.850 --> 34:55.030]  If you're not first, you're last.
[34:57.250 --> 34:58.670]  Have you guys seen the
[34:58.670 --> 34:59.750]  Ricky Bobby movie?
[35:00.510 --> 35:02.670]  No, this is the Ultimate Floor is Lava shit right here.
[35:03.830 --> 35:04.590]  I like
[35:04.590 --> 35:06.270]  the Ricky Bobby story.
[35:11.150 --> 35:11.590]  What?
[35:12.250 --> 35:14.110]  He was a NASCAR driver.
[35:21.140 --> 35:21.800]  Oh, you're
[35:21.800 --> 35:22.740]  gonna die in here, I think.
[35:24.840 --> 35:25.720]  Unless it
[35:31.240 --> 35:31.680]  kills...
[35:31.680 --> 35:32.820]  I guess I'm just gonna
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.800]  die in here? Oh, maybe not.
[35:35.060 --> 35:36.700]  Well, I guess Tortoise and the Hare, right?
[35:36.780 --> 35:38.860]  Like the guy who's slower wins. I think
[35:38.860 --> 35:40.640]  maybe that's the clue. That you want to be
[35:40.640 --> 35:42.760]  second to all this stuff.
[35:50.100 --> 35:52.040]  I have more game.
[35:52.600 --> 35:53.960]  I actually thought you would win.
[35:54.380 --> 35:56.560]  I have like six games built around you.
[35:58.220 --> 36:00.560]  But I'm serious about this this time.
[36:02.060 --> 36:04.100]  No, no, no. No thirdsies.
[36:05.520 --> 36:06.380]  Honestly, it
[36:06.380 --> 36:07.800]  was my fault for making a
[36:08.340 --> 36:10.060]  hare and turtle analogy.
[36:10.060 --> 36:12.080]  It kind of implied you want to be slow.
[36:18.690 --> 36:19.950]  I gotta free you?
[36:21.090 --> 36:21.490]  Yeah, right?
[36:25.320 --> 36:25.840]  What?
[36:30.300 --> 36:32.220]  It must be so fun to be that actor
[36:32.220 --> 36:34.220]  and to just be able to do that voice about
[36:34.220 --> 36:35.580]  whatever you want all day.
[36:35.780 --> 36:38.300]  That guy rules. I love
[36:38.300 --> 36:38.820]  that guy.
[36:41.700 --> 36:44.180]  He was the bad guy in the
[36:44.180 --> 36:45.320]  second season of 24.
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.240]  Ah.
[36:46.800 --> 36:48.360]  He was really good in that show too.
[36:51.060 --> 36:53.380]  Certain hazards in the environment will injure you like the
[36:53.380 --> 36:55.400]  broken glass on the ground. What a lame way
[36:55.400 --> 36:55.860]  to die.
[36:59.240 --> 36:59.700]  Okay.
[37:01.260 --> 37:03.380]  Maybe you can use the mattresses somehow.
[37:04.260 --> 37:04.720]  Possibly.
[37:07.540 --> 37:08.760]  Let's get some first aid.
[37:10.920 --> 37:13.040]  When Saw 2 came out,
[37:15.320 --> 37:17.440]  I didn't see it in theater. My brother, though,
[37:17.800 --> 37:19.360]  who's younger than me, he was like 12
[37:19.360 --> 37:21.500]  at the time, he really wanted to see the movie.
[37:21.840 --> 37:23.640]  And he convinced
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.480]  my mom to take
[37:25.480 --> 37:27.480]  him and his best friend to see it.
[37:29.060 --> 37:31.040]  In the opening sequence,
[37:32.160 --> 37:32.580]  there's
[37:34.840 --> 37:37.420]  a high-octane moment, kind of like the first one
[37:37.420 --> 37:39.280]  with the reverse bear trap. I don't remember what the
[37:39.280 --> 37:41.220]  trap is, though. And as it's
[37:41.220 --> 37:43.480]  happening, my brother is very much
[37:43.480 --> 37:45.440]  like, oh, I fucked up. I need to get out of here.
[37:45.480 --> 37:47.000]  I need to get out of here. So he turned to my mom,
[37:47.380 --> 37:49.640]  who was also like, yo, this is
[37:49.640 --> 37:51.000]  freaky, like kind of freaking out.
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.460]  And he turned to her and was
[37:53.460 --> 37:55.040]  like, we need to leave. We need to leave.
[37:55.200 --> 37:56.960]  And she turned back to him and was like,
[37:57.100 --> 37:58.760]  you paid for these tickets. We're going to stay.
[38:05.500 --> 38:06.600]  Oh, my God.
[38:07.540 --> 38:08.500]  That's so funny.
[38:10.560 --> 38:11.140]  Wow.
[38:11.140 --> 38:12.680]  Wow, you really had
[38:12.680 --> 38:14.760]  to be sure when you went to a movie
[38:14.760 --> 38:16.540]  with your mom, you had to do
[38:16.540 --> 38:18.480]  the due diligence, the research.
[38:19.060 --> 38:20.580]  You better not be
[38:20.580 --> 38:20.940]  scared.
[38:22.250 --> 38:23.500]  She doesn't fuck around.
[38:25.500 --> 38:25.960]  Okay.
[38:28.080 --> 38:28.660]  So...
[38:30.200 --> 38:30.780]  Gideon...
[38:30.780 --> 38:32.500]  I don't think... you think that
[38:32.500 --> 38:33.880]  matters? We got an alphabet.
[38:35.680 --> 38:36.100]  Oh.
[38:37.220 --> 38:38.060]  Okay.
[38:38.680 --> 38:39.420]  S-O-N.
[38:40.840 --> 38:40.900]  Okay.
[38:41.840 --> 38:43.320]  So, S-O.
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.200]  Okay.
[38:47.320 --> 38:48.220]  Flip the lights
[38:48.220 --> 38:49.440]  to get the lower ones.
[38:52.460 --> 38:54.140]  3-7.
[38:55.460 --> 38:56.400]  Oh, 7-
[38:56.400 --> 38:57.440]  3-2.
[38:58.300 --> 38:59.360]  7-3.
[39:00.800 --> 39:02.180]  Let me get
[39:02.180 --> 39:03.340]  to the lock.
[39:03.880 --> 39:04.860]  Let me look at the lock.
[39:05.740 --> 39:07.020]  7-7.
[39:08.140 --> 39:08.980]  3-
[39:09.900 --> 39:12.240]  2. At least they illuminated the lock.
[39:12.860 --> 39:13.200]  Yeah.
[39:13.840 --> 39:15.440]  I was thinking the same thing.
[39:16.840 --> 39:18.060]  Oh, fucking
[39:18.060 --> 39:19.840]  Jesus, stupid glass.
[39:21.800 --> 39:23.440]  I'd like to believe that...
[39:24.260 --> 39:26.140]  What type of Looney Tunes
[39:26.140 --> 39:27.440]  bullshit is this?
[39:27.840 --> 39:29.320]  Where's Wile E. Coyote?
[39:32.700 --> 39:33.420]  Uh...
[39:33.420 --> 39:36.120]  That other guy just goes by.
[39:36.380 --> 39:36.500]  Yeah.
[39:37.580 --> 39:39.760]  The bull guy runs through the background.
[39:41.240 --> 39:42.120]  I don't see
[39:42.120 --> 39:43.860]  anything in here. Yeah.
[39:46.260 --> 39:46.980]  Oh!
[39:47.840 --> 39:49.180]  I hit B!
[39:50.260 --> 39:52.080]  What the fuck?
[39:53.960 --> 39:56.040]  What does it want from me?
[39:58.220 --> 39:59.920]  I even mashed it.
[39:59.920 --> 40:02.020]  It has
[40:02.020 --> 40:03.280]  to be a timing thing, right?
[40:03.560 --> 40:05.720]  Also, once again, where is it going to put me?
[40:06.620 --> 40:07.900]  Oh, God. Oh, no.
[40:08.760 --> 40:09.780]  Alright, back to the
[40:09.780 --> 40:10.700]  intro.
[40:12.600 --> 40:13.080]  Nick!
[40:13.760 --> 40:14.240]  Nick!
[40:15.280 --> 40:16.740]  I'm not dying in here.
[40:17.380 --> 40:17.840]  Nick!
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.680]  Why did you weld this onto us?
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.740]  I don't have that kind of magical power.
[40:23.840 --> 40:24.300]  Don't do that.
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.000]  Don't do that to me.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.120]  Oh, let me skip at least.
[40:29.240 --> 40:29.440]  Okay.
[40:31.700 --> 40:32.780]  I am never gonna
[40:32.780 --> 40:35.180]  fail, even though I didn't fail one of those
[40:35.180 --> 40:36.880]  stupid traps ever again.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.100]  And blah, blah, blah.
[40:39.180 --> 40:40.780]  You failed. I'll give you a second chance.
[40:40.920 --> 40:42.580]  Nobody cares. We've seen it.
[40:42.700 --> 40:44.000]  Bare feet sucks.
[40:45.980 --> 40:46.380]  Uh...
[40:46.380 --> 40:48.960]  Grab the health, because I don't know how to use it.
[40:50.380 --> 40:50.780]  But...
[40:50.780 --> 40:53.140]  Oh, yeah. Have you even looked at your...
[40:53.140 --> 40:53.500]  Yeah.
[40:54.500 --> 40:56.500]  Have you even looked at your items list?
[40:56.920 --> 40:59.060]  I don't... Oh, I guess...
[40:59.060 --> 40:59.480]  In here?
[41:00.960 --> 41:01.840]  Yeah, inventory.
[41:03.140 --> 41:05.140]  What a weird spot for the inventory.
[41:05.940 --> 41:06.640]  Also, like,
[41:06.760 --> 41:09.020]  there's no button
[41:09.020 --> 41:10.380]  to use anything with it.
[41:11.580 --> 41:12.100]  Uh...
[41:13.560 --> 41:15.380]  Maybe you haven't even heard enough yet.
[41:15.760 --> 41:16.180]  That's true.
[41:18.600 --> 41:20.140]  Flip the light immediately.
[41:20.140 --> 41:21.640]  It's 7-3-2, right?
[41:23.240 --> 41:24.440]  7-3-2.
[41:24.500 --> 41:25.340]  Yeah, you're right.
[41:25.820 --> 41:28.040]  Look at you. Good memory.
[41:28.880 --> 41:29.240]  Thank you.
[41:29.340 --> 41:31.460]  Let me tell you, whenever it's my playthrough,
[41:31.660 --> 41:32.340]  don't remember shit.
[41:35.620 --> 41:36.920]  7-3-2.
[41:39.960 --> 41:42.360]  Steam just notified me my friend is playing the finals.
[41:43.160 --> 41:43.360]  Ah!
[41:45.100 --> 41:46.400]  Looney Tunes door.
[41:46.400 --> 41:46.580]  Door.
[41:48.180 --> 41:49.280]  Here comes real door.
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.080]  Oh, you gotta click it twice.
[41:55.300 --> 41:55.440]  Okay.
[41:56.700 --> 41:58.200]  You gotta get both sides of it.
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.080]  And what are you doing with both sides of it, exactly?
[42:02.260 --> 42:02.920]  Like, I don't understand.
[42:03.160 --> 42:04.420]  Great question, Nick.
[42:06.960 --> 42:09.460]  You know the My Hump song from Black Eyed Peas?
[42:09.940 --> 42:10.380]  Oh, yeah.
[42:10.560 --> 42:12.700]  I think he makes the...
[42:14.620 --> 42:16.480]  I think he does that when he hits glass.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.080]  But can I do it?
[42:23.360 --> 42:24.680]  Oh, no. It changes.
[42:24.900 --> 42:26.060]  It's not the same note every time.
[42:26.200 --> 42:26.900]  That's disappointing.
[42:27.720 --> 42:28.940]  He also doesn't say it every time.
[42:30.200 --> 42:30.640]  Checkpoint!
[42:32.020 --> 42:33.340]  What a weird song that was.
[42:33.760 --> 42:35.700]  Yeah, it was. Very odd song.
[42:36.680 --> 42:38.200]  What we gonna do with all that junk?
[42:40.520 --> 42:47.140]  I guess the button.
[42:47.140 --> 42:48.160]  Yeah, I guess so.
[42:49.040 --> 42:50.200]  I had, you know.
[42:53.460 --> 42:54.080]  Oh, a crutch.
[42:54.220 --> 42:55.200]  What am I going to do with this?
[42:55.840 --> 42:56.540]  Is it a weapon?
[42:57.880 --> 42:59.020]  It looks like a weapon.
[43:02.220 --> 43:03.920]  What happened in that elevator?
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.340]  Yeah, I don't want to know.
[43:05.980 --> 43:07.240]  I do not want to know.
[43:08.100 --> 43:08.840]  Door sealed.
[43:09.460 --> 43:10.680]  But I got this crutch.
[43:15.620 --> 43:16.580]  Stupid glass.
[43:17.780 --> 43:19.260]  What else can I interact with?
[43:20.460 --> 43:21.440]  Anything in here?
[43:21.860 --> 43:22.840]  Doesn't look like it.
[43:23.080 --> 43:25.040]  Panel. OK, now the panel works.
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.640]  OK, you got to be right up on it, I guess.
[43:29.840 --> 43:32.760]  This sort of reminds me of the elevator from Final Destination 2.
[43:33.660 --> 43:34.120]  A little bit.
[43:34.660 --> 43:36.020]  Is there a phone? Looks padded.
[43:39.040 --> 43:40.680]  Looks like an insane asylum room.
[43:41.840 --> 43:44.480]  Yeah, is this like just in a warehouse?
[43:44.860 --> 43:49.100]  Like, where, where is Jigsaw's lair?
[43:49.680 --> 43:51.880]  Where is he getting all these televisions?
[43:53.460 --> 43:55.840]  Oh, man, I would love one of those televisions now.
[43:56.300 --> 43:57.240]  Some retro gaming.
[43:57.860 --> 43:59.320]  Oh, classic CRT.
[43:59.720 --> 44:01.560]  It just looks so good that way.
[44:02.140 --> 44:05.320]  Wait, oh, wait, what?
[44:05.320 --> 44:07.540]  Oh, what?
[44:09.540 --> 44:11.160]  What? OK.
[44:13.880 --> 44:16.400]  Well, he's dead.
[44:16.960 --> 44:18.400]  I'm going to take the nail bat.
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.200]  Dead body, check for items.
[44:22.340 --> 44:23.020]  Hell yeah, fuse.
[44:23.660 --> 44:25.700]  Just what I was hoping for. Damn.
[44:27.140 --> 44:28.500]  Your dad put me here, dead.
[44:33.180 --> 44:34.380]  To get to the lobby.
[44:35.620 --> 44:36.480]  Here we go.
[44:39.060 --> 44:40.420]  The whole thing electrified.
[44:40.780 --> 44:41.740]  It looks like it.
[44:46.520 --> 44:47.400]  Uh, so.
[44:48.580 --> 44:50.540]  Can you push those carts onto it?
[44:50.640 --> 44:52.200]  Take his life to earn yours.
[44:52.440 --> 44:53.300]  Well, I already did that.
[44:53.380 --> 44:54.000]  I killed the guy.
[44:55.260 --> 44:56.220]  Can you toss him on there?
[44:56.940 --> 44:58.840]  Oh, let me see.
[44:59.260 --> 45:00.580]  I don't think so.
[45:01.020 --> 45:02.160]  An insult to injury.
[45:02.700 --> 45:03.520]  Let's see.
[45:04.560 --> 45:06.100]  Nah, nah.
[45:10.060 --> 45:11.080]  Yeah, nothing.
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.900]  I have to be sure.
[45:14.140 --> 45:14.720]  Let me close this.
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.180]  Yeah, let me because the prompts have been a bit funky.
[45:17.320 --> 45:18.840]  I had to be thorough.
[45:19.420 --> 45:19.980]  OK.
[45:21.060 --> 45:23.360]  Oh, I guess it just is visual.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.400]  It's just so it's a trap.
[45:26.620 --> 45:28.480]  Don't worry about the electric floor.
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.480]  That's that's related to a different room.
[45:30.580 --> 45:32.480]  It's just working on your side.
[45:32.780 --> 45:35.120]  That electricity is not meant for you.
[45:39.540 --> 45:40.700]  Ah, checkpoint.
[45:41.420 --> 45:43.400]  The most dangerous bathtub of all.
[45:45.640 --> 45:47.200]  Follow the rules.
[45:47.920 --> 45:49.340]  Oh, 30 second timer.
[45:50.860 --> 45:51.280]  Oh, well.
[45:59.860 --> 46:00.740]  The zoom.
[46:00.740 --> 46:02.420]  He doesn't have much time.
[46:03.500 --> 46:04.860]  It's so dramatic.
[46:06.800 --> 46:07.300]  OK.
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.160]  Well, tell me about it.
[46:13.500 --> 46:14.740]  Tell me about it.
[46:15.480 --> 46:17.700]  4, 2, 3, 1.
[46:19.880 --> 46:22.420]  Oh, I'm trying to get them all to be the same number.
[46:23.020 --> 46:23.660]  What the hell are you?
[46:23.760 --> 46:24.340]  Yeah, I don't know.
[46:34.100 --> 46:35.740]  Oh, leave it on to one.
[46:35.740 --> 46:36.780]  See what happens there. Oh.
[46:42.200 --> 46:43.520]  Uh, you all right?
[46:45.640 --> 46:47.500]  Jake, I need a do over.
[46:48.480 --> 46:49.280]  Do over.
[46:49.680 --> 46:51.340]  Hey, can that guy have a second chance?
[46:53.040 --> 46:54.260]  No, I get.
[46:58.200 --> 46:58.960]  You want it?
[47:01.820 --> 47:03.660]  You want to see if we could do that?
[47:04.440 --> 47:06.140]  Oh, God. Oh, you did hit a checkpoint.
[47:06.140 --> 47:08.380]  Oh, I think there's a checkpoint right before it.
[47:09.260 --> 47:10.000]  God, I hope so.
[47:10.340 --> 47:12.720]  Yeah, we walked into the bathroom with the fucked up tub.
[47:12.820 --> 47:13.720]  It gave me a checkpoint.
[47:14.200 --> 47:15.420]  Unless it lied to me.
[47:17.600 --> 47:18.900]  Which, why not?
[47:20.180 --> 47:21.280]  You want to play a game?
[47:21.920 --> 47:24.960]  I'm going to make a game that says you got checkpoints when you didn't.
[47:26.880 --> 47:29.460]  I'm truly the most devious man of all.
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.240]  You thought you knew what safety was and you played this game.
[47:35.220 --> 47:37.020]  OK, follow the rules.
[47:39.740 --> 47:41.220]  And we can skip this.
[47:41.560 --> 47:42.960]  OK, the hell does that mean, though?
[47:44.560 --> 47:47.460]  Three, five, four, five.
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.120]  Zero five.
[47:55.220 --> 47:56.940]  I don't get it.
[48:03.180 --> 48:05.760]  Well, yeah, he's he's going to die.
[48:06.280 --> 48:07.080]  Yeah, he's he's done.
[48:14.720 --> 48:16.140]  Yeah, I don't understand that game.
[48:17.880 --> 48:18.860]  Whatever. We tried.
[48:19.220 --> 48:20.160]  Hey, man, you know what?
[48:20.360 --> 48:22.180]  We reverted the checkpoint for you.
[48:28.290 --> 48:29.830]  I bet you he knew the code.
[48:33.940 --> 48:35.820]  What the fuck are we supposed to do with the time?
[48:37.220 --> 48:38.620]  Let's look around this room real fast.
[48:38.700 --> 48:40.180]  Maybe there's something in here that tells us something.
[48:40.780 --> 48:42.040]  I mean, there has to be right.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.200]  Follow the rules.
[48:50.020 --> 48:51.120]  The rules of time.
[48:51.120 --> 48:52.180]  What the hell are you talking about?
[49:00.060 --> 49:02.720]  Also, it seems like that guy's just supposed to die there.
[49:02.820 --> 49:03.740]  Oh, you just get the code.
[49:05.340 --> 49:05.960]  Peak. Peak?
[49:06.840 --> 49:08.440]  Oh, for God's sake.
[49:10.660 --> 49:12.160]  This game is a real dumb.
[49:13.900 --> 49:14.620]  This is.
[49:15.340 --> 49:18.180]  Oh, I think that's the timer for the timers to save him.
[49:19.020 --> 49:20.460]  Three zero five four.
[49:21.080 --> 49:21.340]  Yeah.
[49:22.460 --> 49:23.200]  We're reverting back.
[49:23.260 --> 49:24.180]  We got to save this man.
[49:24.340 --> 49:24.880]  We got. Yeah.
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.380]  Santa, time it. Let's go.
[49:31.180 --> 49:32.300]  Those are good games, right?
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.340]  I never really played this.
[49:35.300 --> 49:36.200]  Yeah, the first two.
[49:37.400 --> 49:38.820]  First one's cool, like nice.
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.140]  I like that the game mechanic of like rewinding time and stuff.
[49:43.200 --> 49:45.880]  The second one goes on a bit of an emo adventure.
[49:47.140 --> 49:49.360]  And then I don't I remember not liking the third one.
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.720]  And there are a lot of those, right?
[49:52.820 --> 49:54.180]  It's like five or six.
[49:54.420 --> 49:55.220]  You play the most recent.
[49:57.100 --> 49:57.500]  No.
[50:00.020 --> 50:02.120]  Oh, yeah, they just put out a new one, didn't they?
[50:02.220 --> 50:04.880]  Fairly recently, three years before that, right?
[50:05.140 --> 50:06.060]  That was like a reboot.
[50:06.920 --> 50:07.840]  I suck, though.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.320]  I think it was three zero five four.
[50:12.020 --> 50:12.140]  Yeah.
[50:13.660 --> 50:13.840]  OK.
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.080]  Three.
[50:17.880 --> 50:18.280]  Zero.
[50:20.960 --> 50:21.260]  Well.
[50:25.260 --> 50:25.660]  Wait.
[50:27.240 --> 50:28.440]  Let's let's double check.
[50:30.400 --> 50:32.260]  How did I get the five?
[50:33.180 --> 50:34.660]  I don't know.
[50:36.880 --> 50:39.160]  Well, I guess we can play around with it now.
[50:39.960 --> 50:40.840]  Oh, never mind.
[50:42.600 --> 50:43.760]  We're saving this man.
[50:44.760 --> 50:45.620]  I don't care.
[50:46.420 --> 50:48.420]  This is how you get the bonus video, Nick.
[50:49.380 --> 50:50.260]  Oh, shit.
[50:50.440 --> 50:51.020]  You got to save that.
[50:51.080 --> 50:52.180]  That's what he's going to tell you.
[50:52.500 --> 50:53.420]  That's his information.
[50:53.980 --> 50:55.420]  I've got a bonus bonus video
[50:56.380 --> 50:57.440]  going to the next room.
[50:59.420 --> 51:00.520]  OK, this is the last shot.
[51:00.600 --> 51:01.920]  If I don't get him here, then we'll just keep going.
[51:02.540 --> 51:04.200]  I just want to get to another trap.
[51:04.860 --> 51:07.520]  Well, you assume we'll be able to unlock that door without him being alive.
[51:08.320 --> 51:09.480]  That is true.
[51:12.700 --> 51:14.920]  OK, three zero five four.
[51:15.820 --> 51:17.340]  Three zero five four.
[51:17.380 --> 51:18.620]  How do you even do it?
[51:19.040 --> 51:20.020]  All right, well, let's see.
[51:21.140 --> 51:22.280]  Yeah, yeah, we know his life story.
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.440]  I can tell you things about this place.
[51:24.540 --> 51:26.460]  OK, please help me.
[51:35.370 --> 51:37.850]  I don't think it's I don't think it's beatable, Nick.
[51:39.870 --> 51:41.910]  Well, maybe it's just the code to the door, then.
[51:43.630 --> 51:44.890]  I doubt it, but.
[51:51.160 --> 51:52.200]  Three zero.
[51:53.800 --> 51:54.660]  Five four.
[51:54.840 --> 51:57.080]  I don't even I mean, look, OK, what?
[51:58.020 --> 51:58.900]  OK, what?
[51:59.440 --> 52:00.900]  What? What?
[52:02.300 --> 52:06.860]  Oh, what's what kind of stupid shit?
[52:07.380 --> 52:07.620]  All right.
[52:08.420 --> 52:11.280]  Oh, I thought that was a I thought he was alive for a second.
[52:11.600 --> 52:12.900]  You got a knock, man.
[52:13.180 --> 52:13.980]  We've been over this.
[52:16.780 --> 52:17.960]  We go see your buddy.
[52:19.640 --> 52:21.240]  Uh, yeah, you're.
[52:24.140 --> 52:25.140]  Dude, I totally.
[52:25.320 --> 52:25.920]  Oh, my God.
[52:29.080 --> 52:30.100]  It's going to click it.
[52:33.410 --> 52:34.910]  Is this the bomb room?
[52:35.270 --> 52:36.630]  Yeah, there is.
[52:36.950 --> 52:38.790]  Oh, my God.
[52:43.770 --> 52:45.490]  Red versus blue.
[52:46.030 --> 52:47.390]  Geoff just died.
[52:54.010 --> 52:56.870]  Oh, oh, Jesus Christ.
[52:57.330 --> 52:58.230]  What the fuck?
[52:58.370 --> 53:01.710]  I really regret trying to save this guy.
[53:02.050 --> 53:02.270]  Yeah.
[53:05.180 --> 53:06.480]  Oh, no.
[53:09.660 --> 53:11.000]  Oh, man, we.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.040]  Oh, that.
[53:13.280 --> 53:16.680]  I really regret trying like six times to.
[53:23.680 --> 53:24.520]  Oh, boy.
[53:25.160 --> 53:26.660]  OK, so we got another combination.
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.940]  I bet he had that combo on him.
[53:38.740 --> 53:39.860]  Oh, I thought you got.
[53:40.460 --> 53:42.580]  Oh, that would have been incredible.
[53:43.700 --> 53:44.080]  Uh.
[53:46.360 --> 53:46.840]  I don't know.
[53:46.880 --> 53:48.360]  There's another hole in that door over there.
[53:48.960 --> 53:49.220]  Yeah.
[53:50.340 --> 53:51.660]  I guess just poke your head out there.
[54:00.200 --> 54:01.240]  Nope. OK.
[54:03.760 --> 54:06.180]  I was hoping maybe I could Alan Wake to it.
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.680]  Oh, no, I'll bet a collectible or something's in there.
[54:13.140 --> 54:14.880]  Has to be. Yeah.
[54:19.140 --> 54:21.280]  But what? Oh.
[54:24.810 --> 54:26.550]  What a weird mechanic.
[54:26.930 --> 54:28.910]  Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry, dude.
[54:29.410 --> 54:32.150]  Oh, I didn't mean to get stuck.
[54:32.710 --> 54:34.730]  Give me your back on how baseball bats work, though.
[54:35.470 --> 54:36.690]  No, it is not.
[54:38.710 --> 54:39.310]  That's yeah.
[54:40.370 --> 54:40.710]  Whatever.
[54:42.410 --> 54:43.610]  Bolted from the other side.
[54:44.550 --> 54:45.610]  You found a case file.
[54:48.770 --> 54:50.150]  Oh, oh.
[54:51.710 --> 54:52.090]  What?
[54:52.490 --> 54:53.470]  X, X, X, X, X, X.
[54:55.330 --> 54:59.030]  It's the exact same animation from the last hole that he fell down.
[55:02.120 --> 55:03.000]  Need a key.
[55:06.830 --> 55:07.610]  Jigsaw doesn't go.
[55:07.730 --> 55:10.150]  He goes to a lot of trouble, but not this much trouble.
[55:10.550 --> 55:11.230]  Yeah, he doesn't.
[55:11.390 --> 55:13.230]  That's why he brings henchmen in later, right?
[55:15.090 --> 55:15.590]  Oh, yeah.
[55:16.950 --> 55:19.150]  It sounds like he's still running the show right now.
[55:19.450 --> 55:19.990]  That is true.
[55:20.810 --> 55:22.870]  Although he does have the big tall pig guy.
[55:23.190 --> 55:24.730]  That's definitely not Jigsaw.
[55:25.750 --> 55:26.170]  That's true.
[55:31.490 --> 55:34.170]  OK, I don't have anything to open the case.
[55:35.970 --> 55:36.870]  But in here.
[55:39.310 --> 55:41.910]  Oh, oh, oh.
[55:41.930 --> 55:45.750]  OK, that legitimately got me.
[55:45.890 --> 55:46.650]  That caught me off guard.
[55:47.030 --> 55:50.670]  I did not... I did not anticipate, once again,
[55:50.970 --> 55:53.230]  that Looney Tunes bullshit of looking down the barrel.
[55:53.850 --> 55:55.970]  There's just a revolver on the other side.
[55:57.430 --> 55:59.050]  That does happen in the second movie.
[56:00.530 --> 56:01.690]  Oh, well, there we go.
[56:02.270 --> 56:03.670]  You got to warn me about these things, Nick.
[56:03.690 --> 56:05.970]  What else should I anticipate based on the second film?
[56:06.610 --> 56:09.950]  There should be a giant hole with hypodermic needles in it.
[56:10.190 --> 56:10.630]  No.
[56:13.310 --> 56:15.830]  There's an antidote in a...
[56:17.170 --> 56:21.390]  In a case where if you put both your hands in it, it'll slit your wrists.
[56:23.810 --> 56:25.610]  But if you if you have some...
[56:25.610 --> 56:25.950]  Oh, well.
[56:34.250 --> 56:35.810]  Do you think the time is still?
[56:36.870 --> 56:38.530]  Oh, oh, oh, I get it.
[56:38.610 --> 56:39.750]  I get it now. I get it now.
[56:39.870 --> 56:39.990]  What?
[56:42.210 --> 56:44.090]  It's lowest to biggest, I think.
[56:46.530 --> 56:47.350]  Maybe not.
[56:48.050 --> 56:49.690]  Oh, it is. I never saw the...
[56:53.240 --> 56:54.680]  And I did it.
[56:55.900 --> 56:59.040]  Hell, yeah, we're dumb.
[56:59.940 --> 57:01.020]  We're real stupid.
[57:01.440 --> 57:03.440]  I never paid attention to that red mark.
[57:03.600 --> 57:04.580]  I never saw the red mark.
[57:04.760 --> 57:06.780]  I never saw the red mark. It did not appear.
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.940]  We're trying to, like, use this.
[57:10.940 --> 57:12.580]  Oh, no, we let him go.
[57:12.700 --> 57:13.780]  We let him go.
[57:14.040 --> 57:14.900]  Let's go get him.
[57:15.000 --> 57:15.820]  Let's go get him with the bat.
[57:15.860 --> 57:17.480]  Let's go attack him. Yeah.
[57:18.540 --> 57:19.960]  Let's go get this guy. Yeah.
[57:20.960 --> 57:21.760]  What the fuck?
[57:21.840 --> 57:22.300]  Get back here.
[57:22.420 --> 57:23.500]  I can't believe.
[57:25.260 --> 57:26.880]  That we did not notice that.
[57:27.440 --> 57:29.200]  No, it was so obvious.
[57:29.580 --> 57:30.560]  Oh, God.
[57:30.700 --> 57:31.800]  I'll bet people were yelling.
[57:32.700 --> 57:33.740]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[57:34.360 --> 57:35.200]  There are people just...
[57:35.200 --> 57:36.560]  What are they doing?
[57:37.820 --> 57:40.220]  Audience, if you saw that
[57:40.220 --> 57:43.020]  the first time and were like, what the hell are they doing?
[57:43.480 --> 57:44.200]  Please let us know.
[57:44.420 --> 57:44.960]  Thank you.
[57:45.640 --> 57:46.520]  In the comments below.
[57:51.230 --> 57:53.230]  That got us nothing.
[57:54.550 --> 57:55.210]  Except an achievement.
[57:55.570 --> 57:56.750]  But what's that?
[57:56.810 --> 57:57.310]  What's through that hole?
[57:58.650 --> 58:00.430]  What? He said he knew things about.
[58:01.030 --> 58:01.650]  I'm going to go back.
[58:01.690 --> 58:03.290]  I'm going to listen to this still.
[58:03.950 --> 58:06.010]  Oh, 640. For what?
[58:06.610 --> 58:07.990]  Oh, that was just for him to get out.
[58:09.130 --> 58:10.110]  Oh, wait, what's down?
[58:10.150 --> 58:10.650]  What's down there?
[58:10.770 --> 58:11.230]  What's down there?
[58:13.430 --> 58:14.470]  Can you not drop down there?
[58:14.630 --> 58:15.230]  Jump down.
[58:22.260 --> 58:23.420]  We haven't been in here, have we?
[58:24.140 --> 58:25.160]  I don't think so.
[58:27.380 --> 58:27.820]  Puzzle piece.
[58:29.040 --> 58:29.560]  Hell yeah.
[58:29.700 --> 58:30.340]  Two of 25.
[58:31.360 --> 58:32.660]  That was a huge piece.
[58:33.020 --> 58:33.600]  That might be it.
[58:34.200 --> 58:36.040]  OK, this is the door that was bolted from the other side.
[58:36.300 --> 58:36.440]  Yeah.
[58:37.260 --> 58:37.720]  All right.
[58:38.320 --> 58:38.680]  All right.
[58:38.700 --> 58:39.580]  It did get us something.
[58:39.700 --> 58:40.460]  We got to fight the guy.
[58:40.560 --> 58:41.020]  OK, yeah.
[58:41.040 --> 58:41.760]  So we got a collectible.
[58:43.880 --> 58:45.660]  That's a really narrow window of defense.
[58:47.260 --> 58:48.140]  That's OK.
[58:49.520 --> 58:50.560]  We are not dying.
[58:50.780 --> 58:51.400]  We're not dying.
[58:53.160 --> 58:53.640]  There we go.
[58:53.720 --> 58:54.700]  It's stuck in his head.
[58:56.440 --> 58:57.100]  He dies.
[58:57.200 --> 58:57.580]  He did.
[58:58.360 --> 58:59.200]  You take that.
[58:59.320 --> 59:00.240]  He's stuck on the wall.
[59:00.980 --> 59:02.220]  Yeah, let's get through this section.
[59:02.320 --> 59:03.780]  Then we wrap up this video.
[59:04.120 --> 59:06.060]  Part one of this thrilling part.
[59:06.960 --> 59:07.520]  Saw experience.
[59:07.700 --> 59:08.100]  OK.
[59:10.100 --> 59:12.200]  The finest of the Saw franchise.
[59:13.540 --> 59:15.620]  The greatest Saw game ever made.
[59:16.700 --> 59:18.020]  There's not many to pick from.
[59:18.880 --> 59:19.600]  No, there's two.
[59:20.160 --> 59:25.000]  And I don't remember the first one really at all.
[59:25.260 --> 59:26.080]  8-1-2-0.
[59:29.240 --> 59:30.380]  So it's the next.
[59:30.580 --> 59:31.640]  It's the one on the left.
[59:31.820 --> 59:32.620]  That's the death hole.
[59:34.900 --> 59:35.760]  Let's try that.
[59:35.800 --> 59:37.420]  But there was a button prompt for it.
[59:37.740 --> 59:38.360]  Oh, there was?
[59:39.120 --> 59:40.540]  Yeah, I just screwed it up.
[59:40.620 --> 59:40.760]  6-4-3-8.
[59:42.820 --> 59:45.600]  I don't know why I went that way for that, but hey.
[59:45.780 --> 59:46.240]  You know what?
[59:46.460 --> 59:46.960]  Got you there.
[59:46.980 --> 59:47.200]  We got it done?
[59:47.360 --> 59:47.540]  Yeah.
[59:49.240 --> 59:51.500]  Uh, is there a lockpick or anything in here?
[59:51.560 --> 59:52.280]  Oh, puzzle piece.
[59:52.380 --> 59:52.800]  Whoa!
[59:56.100 --> 59:56.940]  Banjo Kazooie.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:02.620]  Oh!
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.080]  Surely it's not loaded with more than one bullet.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.920]  That would be so funny.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.160]  Go back 5-4-3-0.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.440]  Oh.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:21.950]  Oh.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.260]  There's just a pile of bodies of people that keep failing.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.480]  Ah, extended mag.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.440]  What is this?
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:36.680]  Oh my God.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.900]  I mean...
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.720]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.200]  So you can only move them into those holes.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.940]  This has to go here.
[01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:56.370]  Uh...
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:58.710]  Let's just move that, and then this has to go here.
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:00:59.950]  Nope.
[01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:00.290]  Nope.
[01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:01.270]  That's interesting.
[01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:03.510]  Can you move that one?
[01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.250]  I am...
[01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:07.390]  I assume you can't move the one that's moving.
[01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:11.110]  Maybe we're missing some of the pieces.
[01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:14.970]  Because...
[01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:16.630]  Oh, wait.
[01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:17.590]  Oh, wait.
[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.470]  What happened to Craig, that little son of a bitch?
[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:20.090]  He left.
[01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.090]  I don't know.
[01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:22.590]  Has to be this one, right?
[01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:23.610]  Ah, fuck.
[01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.650]  Okay, I got it now.
[01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.550]  We gotta move this...
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:29.330]  down.
[01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:32.090]  And then this up.
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.270]  And then this down.
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.610]  Ah...
[01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.730]  Ah.
[01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:40.790]  This here.
[01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.970]  Look at you!
[01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.430]  There we go!
[01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:46.070]  Gee!
[01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.150]  I think that's the key for the lockbox then, yeah?
[01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:52.590]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:55.550]  A lot of health.
[01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:57.750]  Handmade lockpick.
[01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:00.070]  Nothing.
[01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:02.270]  You get nothing.
[01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:04.390]  Good day, sir.
[01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.090]  Uh, where do you think the key goes?
[01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.510]  I think it goes to the cabinet that gets you the bat.
[01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.390]  To the right here.
[01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.690]  Oh, no, this is just a...
[01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.410]  Oh, shit. I forgot about this.
[01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.030]  Oh. Oh, God.
[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.210]  Oh, God.
[01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.990]  Okay.
[01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.970]  Well, that was way...
[01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:31.250]  Whoa!
[01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.150]  Okay.
[01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:36.670]  Alright.
[01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:39.630]  Just a slightly different bat.
[01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.110]  I guess this is the key to this.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:42.970]  Yep.
[01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.030]  Here we go.
[01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.470]  Okay.
[01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:47.090]  Oh, no.
[01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:47.730]  Oh, boy.
[01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:50.710]  I didn't do good at this last time.
[01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.530]  Yeah, this is how the opening chapter ended.
[01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:54.730]  Oh.
[01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.470]  Oh, you don't think...
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.250]  What does it want from me? I'm clicking...
[01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.210]  What do you think...
[01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:03.510]  Where do you think it's going to take us?
[01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:09.350]  Well, that has been Saw II, flesh and blood.
[01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.690]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:15.290]  Make sure to check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.010]  We got other gameplay videos.
[01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:20.930]  We're doing a bunch of October stuff.
[01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:22.630]  A lot of creepy games.
[01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.630]  I think it's going to take me to the bathtub again before to save the guy.
[01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:27.070]  Oh, no.
[01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:27.670]  That would be my guess.
[01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.630]  Let's just confirm and then wrap up this video, which I've already done.
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.230]  But let's just see.
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:35.390]  We can wrap up round two.
[01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.910]  Here we go.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.870]  Maybe.
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:37.530]  Slowly.
[01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:38.450]  We're not doing this.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:40.070]  We can't do it again.
[01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:41.670]  Oh!
[01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:42.470]  Oh, okay.
[01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.450]  Got the bat.
[01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.910]  You know what?
[01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:46.490]  We might be doing a second wrap up.
[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.290]  That wasn't...
[01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:48.430]  I want to...
[01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:49.710]  I just want to get through this.
[01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:49.950]  Okay.
[01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.010]  I just want to get through this door.
[01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.810]  We're going to cross this balance beam.
[01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:54.630]  Alright, let's give it a shot.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.600]  Use left stick to balance, it says.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:03.540]  Okay.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:05.480]  Try it one more time.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:05.820]  Okay.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:06.300]  Yeah.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.080]  We're getting through this.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.140]  Because the triggers pop up and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with those.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:19.460]  I think those make you move your feet and then the stick is supposed to help you balance.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.080]  Okay.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.440]  Left stick helps you balance.
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:23.860]  Okay.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.340]  Okay.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:25.820]  Alright.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.520]  We got it.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.180]  I got it now.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.520]  We got it.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.260]  Good explanation by you.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:30.720]  Thank you.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.660]  Real Pico Park situation.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.460]  I bet you...
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.760]  We're going to lock it in right here.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.700]  And by we, I mean me.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.020]  You would be fine.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:38.800]  You're doing this.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.280]  I mean, I'm locked in, baby.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.340]  Let's cross.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:42.640]  Okay.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.460]  I'm going to pay attention.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:44.900]  Right.
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:46.700]  Okay.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.840]  Yeah, you're totally right.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.420]  This looks real stupid.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.920]  This looks real dumb.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:51.760]  Oh!
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.900]  Come on!
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:53.680]  Wait!
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.180]  You piece of shit game.
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.080]  You piece of shit game.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.020]  Shut up!
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.180]  We are going to cross one of these fucking balance beams.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:07.980]  Oh, are we?
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.260]  Yup.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:10.800]  It's happening.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:11.560]  This one.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:17.840]  I'm so glad that we're not committed to a full playthrough of this because it would take forever for me to do any of these.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.480]  Okay.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.080]  Here we go.
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:25.620]  Alright, here we go.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.300]  Easy peasy.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.260]  First time's the charm.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:28.900]  Sprinting.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.440]  Here we go.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.100]  Lock.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:33.500]  Open.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.080]  Unlock.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.040]  Walk the deck.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:36.340]  Right.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.080]  Left.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:37.760]  Right.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.460]  Left.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.200]  Right.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:39.920]  Left.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:40.700]  Right.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.440]  Left.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.080]  What?
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:42.780]  Left.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.140]  I'm going to throw my controller.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.820]  I'm going to fucking throw my controller.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.300]  God!
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.260]  Damn it!
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.720]  You piece of shit.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.600]  Did you know we have a podcast?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.860]  Yeah, we got a podcast.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.520]  It's called the Regulation Pod.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.660]  Regulatrion.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.320]  God damn it.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.700]  Go to Regulatrion.com.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.900]  What's wrong with me, Nick?
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.660]  Why can't I do this?
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.640]  It's a balance beam issue, man.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  Oh my God.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:15.940]  Okay.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.660]  Right, left.
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.200]  Right, left.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:18.820]  Right, left.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.600]  If you like this video...
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:20.800]  And then balance with the stick.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:27.460]  I suggest you watch the Pico Park 2 stream video, Vod, that we have up.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.440]  Right, left.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.620]  Right, left.

[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.420]  Right, left.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.420]  Right, left.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.360]  Oh my God, you did it.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.240]  Right, yeah!
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.140]  Yeah!
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.760]  Fuck you, balance beam.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.560]  Piece of shit.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.580]  Gymnastics.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.360]  Dumb it.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.920]  Why did I say dumb it?
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.780]  What a fucking idiot I am.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.600]  Oh my God, dumb it.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.980]  Anyway, thank you so much for watching.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.500]  Let's see if this is a hole that will blow my...
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.280]  Needs a nail?
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.140]  Wait.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.080]  You didn't take the bat with a nail, did you?
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.360]  Oh wait, do you have a nail?
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:01.680]  No!
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:03.500]  No!
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:04.760]  No!
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.340]  Thanks for watching.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:11.760]  Bye!
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.580]  Bye.
