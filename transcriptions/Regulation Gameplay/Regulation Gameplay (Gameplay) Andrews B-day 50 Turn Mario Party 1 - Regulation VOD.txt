[00:00.000 --> 00:01.780]  Alright, well I'm going live on that note.
[00:02.060 --> 00:03.540]  Here we go. On that what?
[00:05.320 --> 00:06.120]  On that...
[00:06.120 --> 00:06.740]  You know what?
[00:07.500 --> 00:08.540]  Gavin's got you rattled.
[00:09.340 --> 00:10.200]  I guess so.
[00:10.340 --> 00:14.020]  We're live. Hi everybody! Welcome to Andrew's birthday stream.
[00:14.460 --> 00:15.420]  Happy birthday, Andrew.
[00:15.940 --> 00:18.920]  Oh, wait. I was muted. I was muted because we had to do a re-sync.
[00:19.020 --> 00:19.980]  No! Stop!
[00:21.240 --> 00:22.240]  Stop with the mutes.
[00:22.260 --> 00:23.660]  Happy birthday to me!
[00:24.420 --> 00:25.600]  Andrew, how old are you, son?
[00:25.860 --> 00:27.620]  I'm 30 now.
[00:27.620 --> 00:28.420]  Wow!
[00:28.900 --> 00:31.900]  So probably like 30 turns, right?
[00:32.440 --> 00:32.760]  No!
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.260]  There's no 30 turns.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.940]  Why would we do 30 turns?
[00:38.920 --> 00:40.040]  I want to end this company.
[00:40.220 --> 00:42.360]  We're doing 50 turns. We're shutting this thing down.
[00:42.700 --> 00:43.300]  We're wrapping it up.
[00:43.640 --> 00:45.860]  Next year when Geoff is 50, we'll do 30 turns.
[00:46.080 --> 00:46.620]  That sounds great.
[00:48.820 --> 00:50.900]  Isn't it the more recent Mario Parties?
[00:51.020 --> 00:52.440]  Isn't their max 30? Or is it 20?
[00:53.060 --> 00:54.080]  On the Switch ones.
[00:54.580 --> 00:57.000]  Yeah, like 25 or something.
[00:57.000 --> 00:57.840]  Definitely not 50.
[00:58.640 --> 00:59.200]  Great.
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.380]  Maybe they determined that 50 turns was unhealthy
[01:03.380 --> 01:04.960]  for anyone to sit down for.
[01:06.260 --> 01:08.680]  What I'm so excited about
[01:08.680 --> 01:09.980]  is apparently...
[01:09.980 --> 01:11.460]  Nick, you've played this.
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  Geoff, you may have played this once.
[01:12.940 --> 01:14.100]  Gavin, you've never played this.
[01:14.720 --> 01:17.560]  You were the most decorated Mario Party guy
[01:17.560 --> 01:18.560]  amongst us.
[01:19.500 --> 01:21.260]  Bong. Bong.
[01:22.220 --> 01:23.460]  There you go.
[01:23.600 --> 01:23.960]  Yeah!
[01:24.320 --> 01:24.680]  Yeah!
[01:27.760 --> 01:28.480]  That's horrendous.
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.900]  How many of these are going to be sound based?
[01:32.720 --> 01:33.680]  Not really any.
[01:33.780 --> 01:34.960]  Because I also don't have any audio.
[01:35.400 --> 01:35.600]  Great.
[01:37.180 --> 01:38.920]  No, because I was going to run it through
[01:38.920 --> 01:39.480]  my HDMI.
[01:40.700 --> 01:41.840]  You were very helpful.
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.440]  Well, I said you don't have to capture.
[01:44.540 --> 01:45.620]  You can run it straight to your telly.
[01:46.780 --> 01:48.340]  But I don't have audio when I do that.
[01:48.520 --> 01:50.900]  It's fine. I'm going to kick your ass anyway.
[01:51.020 --> 01:51.820]  I'm kicking everyone's ass.
[01:51.820 --> 01:54.160]  I'm winning this Mario Party. It's my party.
[01:54.460 --> 01:55.500]  I'm winning this game.
[01:55.500 --> 01:57.040]  I'm going to smash your face into your own cake.
[01:57.340 --> 02:00.480]  If this game wasn't any good,
[02:00.540 --> 02:02.420]  there wouldn't have been all those other Mario Parties
[02:02.420 --> 02:03.060]  you guys played.
[02:03.720 --> 02:06.060]  Must be pretty fucking good, this game.
[02:06.920 --> 02:08.960]  I mean, one of the great games
[02:08.960 --> 02:09.500]  of all time.
[02:10.340 --> 02:11.820]  One of the great series of all time.
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.820]  I would take the Mario Party series
[02:14.820 --> 02:16.360]  over GTA, personally.
[02:17.440 --> 02:18.140]  You know,
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.540]  Gavin, while you were taking your shit,
[02:20.540 --> 02:22.900]  Andrew was mentioning how he sees
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.660]  me as more of a Wario
[02:24.660 --> 02:27.180]  and you as more of a...
[02:27.180 --> 02:28.760]  Who'd you say? Kirby?
[02:29.380 --> 02:29.640]  Yoshi.
[02:30.180 --> 02:32.840]  I love Kirby in Mario's Party.
[02:34.160 --> 02:35.220]  I've just always been
[02:35.220 --> 02:36.660]  an annoying bastard like Wario.
[02:38.860 --> 02:40.400]  Wario is an annoying bastard.
[02:41.820 --> 02:42.920]  You know, I've really felt it
[02:42.920 --> 02:44.120]  in these last few streams.
[02:45.680 --> 02:46.740]  Hi! No!
[02:47.580 --> 02:47.880]  No!
[02:48.440 --> 02:48.800]  Shit.
[02:51.740 --> 02:52.760]  The end of my
[02:52.760 --> 02:53.840]  9 fell off.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.500]  That's my ATM code.
[02:56.860 --> 02:57.220]  What?
[03:00.800 --> 03:01.560]  1, 2, 3?
[03:03.760 --> 03:04.900]  Hey Gavin, what's your friend code?
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.440]  1, 2, 3.
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.420]  I was reading out my friend code to Nick earlier.
[03:09.020 --> 03:10.880]  I was slowly reading 1, 2, 3,
[03:10.980 --> 03:12.840]  4, 5. I'd say we got all the way
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.100]  to 4 before he sighed.
[03:15.820 --> 03:16.760]  I sighed a little
[03:16.760 --> 03:17.880]  and I was like, what are the odds?
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.040]  And then I typed it.
[03:20.520 --> 03:22.540]  I did it Spaceball style too.
[03:22.600 --> 03:23.580]  I was like, 1,
[03:25.440 --> 03:25.840]  2,
[03:28.720 --> 03:30.340]  This is the star spot.
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.040]  I miss Spaceballs. I want to watch that sometime soon.
[03:34.180 --> 03:34.580]  Spaceballs!
[03:34.840 --> 03:35.960]  What about the sequel?
[03:38.260 --> 03:38.980]  Coming soon.
[03:39.420 --> 03:40.200]  That's what they say.
[03:40.720 --> 03:41.000]  We'll see.
[03:42.400 --> 03:44.820]  We're flying through this game. This is going to take no time at all.
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.180]  We got some blues going.
[03:49.040 --> 03:50.780]  God, look how bad this looks.
[03:50.960 --> 03:51.940]  This looks like shit.
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.440]  The N64 wasn't terrible.
[03:55.740 --> 03:56.860]  What year did this game
[03:56.860 --> 03:59.020]  come out? Were you guys alive when this game came out?
[03:59.140 --> 04:00.420]  This game came out,
[04:00.500 --> 04:02.740]  it's funny, 98 in Japan,
[04:03.280 --> 04:04.600]  99 in North America.
[04:05.440 --> 04:06.900]  And what year were you born, Andrew?
[04:07.540 --> 04:08.020]  94.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.060]  Oh, we got a 1 for 3.
[04:11.860 --> 04:12.980]  We've got a hype train
[04:12.980 --> 04:13.940]  level 9.
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.160]  What does that mean?
[04:15.940 --> 04:17.160]  Thank you for the hype train, everybody.
[04:17.340 --> 04:18.740]  Thank you so much for the hype train.
[04:19.120 --> 04:19.960]  People are hyping it up.
[04:21.360 --> 04:22.820]  Hey, Andrew, buy yourself something nice.
[04:23.020 --> 04:25.820]  Drop the treasure chest into the pipe so it falls down.
[04:26.020 --> 04:27.500]  I gotta get this treasure chest first.
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.140]  And drop it with A.
[04:29.700 --> 04:29.940]  Okay.
[04:31.340 --> 04:32.980]  What count is the C buttons?
[04:33.140 --> 04:34.120]  Okay, it's the other stick.
[04:35.160 --> 04:36.780]  So Luigi does that. What do we do?
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.920]  I don't think we do anything. I think we just watch.
[04:39.960 --> 04:41.060]  Are you serious?
[04:41.060 --> 04:42.440]  I think so. My favorite game.
[04:43.320 --> 04:45.240]  Alright, we'll figure out what would...
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.340]  Yeah, why did it just say Luigi?
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.180]  It's 3v1.
[04:51.480 --> 04:52.340]  Well, good luck, Geoff.
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.520]  Thanks. So you're just gonna...
[04:55.260 --> 04:56.620]  Okay. And now we just watch.
[04:57.520 --> 04:59.180]  It's just complete random chance.
[04:59.420 --> 05:00.500]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:00.500 --> 05:01.600]  Go, go, go.
[05:02.220 --> 05:04.020]  I don't even know where I am. I don't know why I'm yelling together.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.920]  Oh, I don't either. Do we want to be here or not?
[05:06.240 --> 05:08.300]  Uh, we want it to land on her head.
[05:08.520 --> 05:08.720]  No!
[05:08.720 --> 05:09.040]  No!
[05:09.880 --> 05:10.420]  No!
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.940]  Well, shit.
[05:13.580 --> 05:15.320]  Thanks, Geoff.
[05:15.620 --> 05:16.460]  That was stupid.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.640]  Goddammit.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.600]  49 more of that bullshit.
[05:22.560 --> 05:23.660]  It's gonna get worse.
[05:25.140 --> 05:25.920]  Oh, that rules.
[05:26.360 --> 05:27.320]  Look how sad you all look.
[05:28.400 --> 05:30.000]  I look how I feel.
[05:32.040 --> 05:32.980]  That game was basically...
[05:32.980 --> 05:33.980]  Happy birthday, Andrew.
[05:34.460 --> 05:36.740]  That was basically a dice roll with only four numbers.
[05:36.740 --> 05:39.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:39.400 --> 05:40.400]  I know, I know. It's my turn.
[05:40.480 --> 05:41.340]  Gotta move, gotta move.
[05:42.140 --> 05:44.360]  Our hype train is over 9,000.
[05:44.660 --> 05:46.140]  That doesn't seem accurate.
[05:46.760 --> 05:48.500]  No, it says this has massive damage.
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.860]  That is accurate.
[05:52.500 --> 05:54.540]  For those just joining us, this is round...
[05:54.540 --> 05:55.460]  Two.
[05:56.340 --> 05:56.740]  No!
[06:03.470 --> 06:04.590]  Luigi! Geoff!
[06:05.750 --> 06:06.310]  That's me.
[06:07.490 --> 06:07.930]  Alright.
[06:08.810 --> 06:09.650]  I'll take it.
[06:10.050 --> 06:11.850]  Bring it on, you fuckers.
[06:13.310 --> 06:14.370]  Let's do this.
[06:16.230 --> 06:17.670]  Oh, coin block bash.
[06:21.570 --> 06:22.370]  Smug cloud.
[06:23.470 --> 06:24.170]  Oh, shit.
[06:24.210 --> 06:24.770]  I got a hammer.
[06:25.430 --> 06:26.890]  Coins come out of these sturdy blocks.
[06:26.930 --> 06:29.490]  When you break them, the person with the hammer can break them in one hit.
[06:30.410 --> 06:32.790]  Oh, someone pressed...
[06:32.790 --> 06:32.930]  Okay.
[06:33.750 --> 06:34.270]  Alright.
[06:34.330 --> 06:35.450]  We'll figure it out.
[06:40.670 --> 06:42.210]  Give me the coin.
[06:43.210 --> 06:45.310]  How many times do I have to hit something?
[06:46.350 --> 06:47.490]  Oh, I didn't even take the coin.
[06:47.730 --> 06:48.190]  You idiot.
[06:51.450 --> 06:52.770]  Give me this one.
[06:56.810 --> 06:57.850]  Get away!
[06:58.730 --> 06:59.250]  Shit!
[06:59.250 --> 06:59.590]  Shit!
[07:00.170 --> 07:01.770]  Oh, we can take the hammer?
[07:03.010 --> 07:04.310]  Give me that!
[07:04.910 --> 07:07.170]  I have no idea what just happened.
[07:07.410 --> 07:09.330]  I didn't know we could steal the hammer.
[07:09.510 --> 07:10.610]  I got some money bags.
[07:10.670 --> 07:11.310]  This is what happened.
[07:14.410 --> 07:15.250]  Twelve coins.
[07:15.590 --> 07:16.450]  Son of a bitch.
[07:17.730 --> 07:18.650]  Oh, yeah.
[07:20.390 --> 07:21.530]  That's a happy DK.
[07:23.410 --> 07:25.110]  If you bet on me to win,
[07:25.530 --> 07:27.070]  I apologize in advance.
[07:27.650 --> 07:29.010]  I'm not good.
[07:31.130 --> 07:31.630]  Seven!
[07:32.650 --> 07:33.650]  Oh, shit.
[07:34.550 --> 07:35.410]  What's it gonna be?
[07:36.430 --> 07:38.390]  Which way is the star?
[07:39.250 --> 07:40.150]  Oh, Boo's up there.
[07:42.610 --> 07:44.150]  Is there a jump to star button?
[07:44.330 --> 07:46.910]  Yeah, right. It's shorter.
[07:47.930 --> 07:48.450]  But here's the thing.
[07:48.550 --> 07:50.770]  You can only get a star when Toad is displayed.
[07:51.850 --> 07:52.190]  Oh!
[07:52.750 --> 07:53.970]  So Toad is currently there.
[07:53.970 --> 07:55.050]  So if you're first, you're fine.
[07:55.090 --> 07:57.350]  As long as nobody hits a green space.
[08:00.010 --> 08:00.830]  Like this.
[08:01.030 --> 08:02.450]  Sounds very complicated.
[08:03.110 --> 08:04.770]  So now, it's Bowser.
[08:05.190 --> 08:07.490]  So if you get to the end, you don't get anything.
[08:09.050 --> 08:10.690]  So you don't want to be there first.
[08:11.890 --> 08:12.810]  I'm there first!
[08:14.650 --> 08:15.650]  Look at that way.
[08:18.790 --> 08:20.350]  Level 11 hype train.
[08:21.410 --> 08:21.870]  Woo!
[08:22.790 --> 08:24.010]  You guys are nuts!
[08:25.330 --> 08:26.350]  Shy Guy says...
[08:29.030 --> 08:30.110]  Oh, I'm so happy.
[08:30.250 --> 08:31.330]  I love this game so much.
[08:31.410 --> 08:33.410]  I haven't played it since...
[08:34.110 --> 08:34.570]  1998?
[08:36.610 --> 08:38.630]  A is white. B is red.
[08:39.010 --> 08:40.250]  A is white.
[08:40.970 --> 08:42.250]  B is red.
[08:42.330 --> 08:44.530]  I feel like if we just look at what he's...
[08:44.530 --> 08:47.030]  He has the symbol on his flag, it appears.
[08:48.210 --> 08:49.150]  I'm not gonna try to remember.
[08:49.150 --> 08:51.090]  I'm just gonna put whatever thing he says.
[08:51.350 --> 08:53.470]  This is gonna confuse the dick out of me.
[08:53.470 --> 08:53.950]  I can just tell.
[08:54.210 --> 08:56.430]  A is white.
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.190]  A is white.
[08:59.590 --> 09:00.350]  B is red.
[09:01.250 --> 09:02.370]  A. B.
[09:02.970 --> 09:04.730]  A. B.
[09:05.170 --> 09:06.650]  3. 4.
[09:07.310 --> 09:09.130]  Alright, everybody hold on.
[09:09.450 --> 09:09.690]  White!
[09:11.050 --> 09:12.050]  Alright, good job Mario.
[09:12.490 --> 09:12.830]  Red!
[09:13.450 --> 09:17.550]  No, you guys are all idiots.
[09:17.550 --> 09:18.710]  It's just not a Shy Guy.
[09:19.010 --> 09:20.270]  I'm thinking full steps or not.
[09:20.970 --> 09:22.590]  This is how the Edmund Fitzgerald happened.
[09:24.690 --> 09:25.570]  Oh, fuck.
[09:27.310 --> 09:28.490]  Oh, this is easy.
[09:29.690 --> 09:30.550]  Oh, no!
[09:32.730 --> 09:33.170]  Oh, no!
[09:33.310 --> 09:34.150]  You piece of shit!
[09:34.750 --> 09:36.410]  You piece of shit!
[09:37.110 --> 09:39.130]  I didn't know he would trick us, the prick.
[09:39.330 --> 09:42.170]  He said he would sometimes raise two flags to trick us.
[09:42.250 --> 09:43.390]  He did a stutter step.
[09:43.670 --> 09:44.530]  Say that on the news.
[09:44.530 --> 09:45.110]  I can't read!
[09:45.790 --> 09:49.570]  I didn't watch the news today.
[09:49.750 --> 09:50.350]  Sorry.
[09:50.730 --> 09:51.950]  That's on me.
[09:53.600 --> 09:54.780]  Where's Mario going?
[09:55.300 --> 09:57.880]  Andrew has a level 13 birthday hype train.
[09:57.940 --> 09:58.760]  Oh my god!
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.420]  I'm a train guy!
[10:01.340 --> 10:02.700]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.620]  When will it reach his age?
[10:06.320 --> 10:06.920]  Five.
[10:09.180 --> 10:11.860]  So you have to actually land right on it.
[10:12.520 --> 10:12.860]  No!
[10:13.440 --> 10:15.040]  I want baby steps!
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.740]  I want baby steps!
[10:17.440 --> 10:17.840]  Baby.
[10:19.960 --> 10:21.620]  How are we ever going to get this star?
[10:21.880 --> 10:23.000]  You have to land right on it.
[10:23.140 --> 10:24.440]  No, you just loop.
[10:24.560 --> 10:26.440]  When you get to the end, it loops you back to the start.
[10:26.440 --> 10:28.460]  I'll steal the stars or coins for you.
[10:28.520 --> 10:31.200]  The cost is 50 coins, so I don't have 50 coins.
[10:31.400 --> 10:32.720]  Stealing coins is absolutely free.
[10:33.040 --> 10:34.180]  Yeah, steal some coins, please.
[10:34.900 --> 10:37.120]  There's a certain person with 49 coins.
[10:37.160 --> 10:38.140]  Yeah, there's a...
[10:38.140 --> 10:38.680]  Hey!
[10:38.680 --> 10:39.700]  Yeah.
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.700]  That's what you get for reading instructions.
[10:43.460 --> 10:45.280]  That's what you get for watching the news.
[10:46.040 --> 10:46.400]  Oh, wow.
[10:46.760 --> 10:47.920]  Three coins?
[10:48.440 --> 10:48.840]  Thanks, man.
[10:49.640 --> 10:49.800]  Oh.
[10:52.560 --> 10:53.160]  Hello.
[10:55.360 --> 10:56.480]  Oh, no.
[10:57.400 --> 10:59.680]  That's the least threatening browser I've ever seen.
[10:59.680 --> 11:01.900]  That's some real Mario 64 looking browser.
[11:03.320 --> 11:04.600]  He still looked better in that game.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.460]  Wait, what?
[11:07.300 --> 11:07.780]  Uh...
[11:07.780 --> 11:09.640]  One on three, and the losers lose 10 coins.
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.500]  Geoff! You son of a bitch!
[11:12.080 --> 11:13.380]  Yeah, why am I involved?
[11:13.920 --> 11:15.260]  Oh, no!
[11:15.680 --> 11:17.740]  Oh, for God's sake!
[11:18.080 --> 11:18.800]  Oh, rotate.
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.480]  It's the hand destroyer.
[11:22.460 --> 11:22.740]  Okay.
[11:22.980 --> 11:24.380]  I'm gonna put my palm on the line.
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.120]  Do we do clockwise?
[11:26.920 --> 11:27.900]  Yeah, it's clockwise.
[11:29.260 --> 11:30.960]  Oh, no!
[11:32.440 --> 11:34.220]  That's not the way I use my palm.
[11:34.220 --> 11:36.160]  You don't use it clockwise?
[11:36.380 --> 11:37.060]  No.
[11:37.320 --> 11:38.120]  No!
[11:40.000 --> 11:40.700]  Get him!
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.640]  No!
[11:43.300 --> 11:46.580]  I was going as hard as I could!
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.140]  Ow.
[11:48.420 --> 11:49.320]  That definitely hurt.
[11:50.160 --> 11:50.380]  God.
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.560]  Why are you jerking off
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.380]  onto our bodies?
[11:55.840 --> 11:56.400]  Oh!
[12:04.420 --> 12:05.300]  Taisha Dominance.
[12:06.160 --> 12:07.700]  Oh, no, we have to do another
[12:07.700 --> 12:08.820]  Cardio Mini Game!
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.360]  He just spunked all over us.
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.320]  Are there only three?
[12:13.440 --> 12:14.280]  I've claimed you.
[12:15.160 --> 12:16.840]  Is there a rope kink in the smut?
[12:17.740 --> 12:19.080]  You are right, there can be.
[12:20.520 --> 12:22.280]  Hit the plant in the Bowser suit
[12:22.280 --> 12:23.080]  with your hammer.
[12:24.000 --> 12:24.980]  How do you hit?
[12:25.580 --> 12:25.600]  A.
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.140]  Alright, so let's just beat the
[12:29.140 --> 12:30.520]  shit out of him with a hammer.
[12:30.940 --> 12:31.680]  Smash that.
[12:32.380 --> 12:33.260]  Come on, kids!
[12:34.180 --> 12:35.460]  Let's get all his money!
[12:36.380 --> 12:39.200]  Let's get those coins back!
[12:39.560 --> 12:39.880]  Ow!
[12:42.360 --> 12:42.920]  Ow!
[12:43.340 --> 12:44.180]  This is bullying!
[12:44.660 --> 12:45.580]  You're bullying!
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.200]  You stole all our coins!
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.060]  I didn't do that!
[12:50.060 --> 12:50.440]  I did!
[12:50.600 --> 12:52.000]  Give me that bag!
[12:53.060 --> 12:54.400]  Come back here!
[12:54.800 --> 12:55.400]  Stop!
[12:56.400 --> 12:59.400]  He doesn't have any bags worth of money anymore!
[12:59.960 --> 13:00.880]  We're robbing him blind!
[13:02.020 --> 13:02.620]  Ow!
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.660]  You motherfuckers!
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.100]  Did we just steal all his money?
[13:09.200 --> 13:10.060]  I think we...
[13:12.620 --> 13:15.960]  You lost sixteen coins!
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.640]  Your actual coins are on the line for that!
[13:17.640 --> 13:19.360]  You dickheads!
[13:20.360 --> 13:21.940]  This game is so harsh!
[13:26.220 --> 13:27.640]  Nick's fucking losing it.
[13:27.840 --> 13:29.000]  I think I know why
[13:29.460 --> 13:31.760]  that dude in England stopped talking to me after this game.
[13:33.560 --> 13:35.080]  I don't know what that means.
[13:35.180 --> 13:36.840]  What dude? I'm just kidding.
[13:38.280 --> 13:39.380]  Hey, it's back at that thing.
[13:40.380 --> 13:40.940]  A friend I had.
[13:41.300 --> 13:41.900]  On base housing.
[13:43.680 --> 13:45.140]  Did this game end our friendship?
[13:45.900 --> 13:46.380]  Yes!
[13:46.540 --> 13:47.360]  I think it might have.
[13:47.720 --> 13:49.300]  Do you think it could tonight?
[13:51.500 --> 13:53.800]  Things are already tense between Gavin and Andrew.
[13:54.380 --> 13:54.940]  Yeah, that's true.
[13:55.780 --> 13:57.300]  I think it's nice at the moment.
[13:57.800 --> 13:58.460]  Yeah, it's great.
[13:59.540 --> 14:00.700]  Well, that's because I'm streaming.
[14:02.440 --> 14:04.640]  I'm thinking of changing my focus to Eric anyway.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.540]  He could use it.
[14:07.020 --> 14:07.840]  Yeah, he could use it.
[14:08.320 --> 14:10.460]  Gavin only gets me when we're streaming.
[14:11.040 --> 14:12.480]  He's the worst when streaming.
[14:12.480 --> 14:14.280]  Outside of that, Gavin is fantastic.
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.120]  Guys.
[14:17.080 --> 14:17.500]  Crane game.
[14:19.220 --> 14:21.420]  You gave me some audio feedback online.
[14:23.120 --> 14:25.180]  Yeah, I can talk about that on the show.
[14:26.400 --> 14:27.620]  Crane game crane.
[14:28.700 --> 14:29.420]  A repeatedly.
[14:30.680 --> 14:31.080]  Okay.
[14:32.380 --> 14:34.320]  Luigi has to move and lower the crane.
[14:35.500 --> 14:36.040]  We just wiggle.
[14:36.740 --> 14:37.120]  Wiggle wiggle.
[14:38.740 --> 14:40.320]  Don't you dare try to grab me.
[14:41.080 --> 14:43.080]  Don't you dare try to come after me.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.540]  I'm gonna wiggle so hard.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.860]  I'm wiggling so much.
[14:46.220 --> 14:47.700]  I'm gonna...
[14:47.700 --> 14:48.580]  Oh, hey.
[14:49.060 --> 14:50.160]  I can't do anything.
[14:52.220 --> 14:53.360]  I dropped it.
[14:54.920 --> 14:56.620]  You never pulled it up.
[14:57.280 --> 14:58.640]  It never made it off the ground.
[14:59.480 --> 15:00.240]  I dropped it.
[15:00.480 --> 15:02.020]  You got distracted by the loot.
[15:02.460 --> 15:03.300]  I wanted loot.
[15:08.140 --> 15:09.260]  Yeah.
[15:12.820 --> 15:13.700]  Low roll.
[15:20.230 --> 15:21.830]  Jesus Christ.
[15:22.390 --> 15:23.490]  Holy shit.
[15:24.010 --> 15:25.510]  Can I extend this?
[15:27.750 --> 15:28.470]  Just a hair.
[15:29.210 --> 15:29.770]  I guess not.
[15:31.250 --> 15:32.270]  Oh boy.
[15:33.070 --> 15:33.630]  Okay.
[15:33.730 --> 15:34.810]  If I get a five,
[15:35.270 --> 15:36.730]  I get a star.
[15:37.530 --> 15:38.470]  Five or above.
[15:39.030 --> 15:41.870]  Can we get some piss rats in the chat?
[15:42.550 --> 15:42.690]  No!
[15:43.810 --> 15:44.930]  No piss rats.
[15:45.350 --> 15:46.870]  What does the exclamation mean?
[15:47.750 --> 15:49.230]  Oh, it's like a chaos space.
[15:49.630 --> 15:51.390]  Hope for a reversal of fortune.
[15:51.670 --> 15:53.050]  Oh, don't you know.
[15:53.670 --> 15:54.530]  Chance time.
[15:55.570 --> 15:56.650]  Oh, balls.
[15:57.470 --> 15:58.250]  You can switch with me.
[15:58.250 --> 15:59.410]  Just so we can up the stakes.
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.040]  It's pointless.
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.420]  Oh, I appreciate it.
[16:12.760 --> 16:14.620]  I'm not going to forget that shit later.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.480]  Too bad.
[16:19.580 --> 16:21.000]  Give me a mean later.
[16:21.960 --> 16:23.860]  I feel like he owes me.
[16:24.020 --> 16:24.400]  You owe me.
[16:27.180 --> 16:27.960]  I'll take it.
[16:31.060 --> 16:32.000]  It's always me versus you guys.
[16:34.020 --> 16:35.320]  I feel like the modern games
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.360]  so rarely have a 1v3 now.
[16:37.960 --> 16:38.180]  Really?
[16:38.220 --> 16:38.840]  That's all they play.
[16:41.040 --> 16:41.940]  Oh, it's your favorite.
[16:42.060 --> 16:43.240]  Oh, this one's the best.
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.080]  I love this one.
[16:44.420 --> 16:48.580]  Just fucking sit back and watch you not win.
[16:48.800 --> 16:49.220]  It's great.
[16:50.780 --> 16:51.660]  Alright, let's go.
[16:52.480 --> 16:53.460]  Put in the same one.
[16:58.700 --> 17:00.140]  I once again did not pay attention
[17:00.140 --> 17:01.020]  to where I was at the bottom.
[17:01.020 --> 17:03.000]  Nope, not even a little.
[17:05.440 --> 17:07.020]  I think it might be
[17:07.020 --> 17:07.980]  the second pipe
[17:08.720 --> 17:09.940]  going left to right.
[17:10.300 --> 17:11.120]  Oh, it's going third.
[17:11.800 --> 17:13.880]  Oh, the birthday boy!
[17:14.560 --> 17:15.620]  Give me them coins!
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.820]  He's already got enough here.
[17:18.340 --> 17:20.800]  Okay, now I just... we can't...
[17:20.800 --> 17:22.140]  Gavin, you need to have a low roll.
[17:22.400 --> 17:23.580]  You can't be above six.
[17:24.740 --> 17:25.600]  Six or lower.
[17:25.780 --> 17:27.820]  Are we about to beat a record on Twitch?
[17:27.820 --> 17:29.220]  We're beating a record?
[17:30.100 --> 17:31.460]  Oh, we're close to it.
[17:31.600 --> 17:33.300]  It says about to beat your last record.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.140]  Keep up the support.
[17:34.140 --> 17:36.780]  Thank you so much, everyone.
[17:37.100 --> 17:38.540]  You're breaking our shit.
[17:40.220 --> 17:40.740]  Blam!
[17:40.900 --> 17:43.100]  Oh, come on! Son of a bitch!
[17:44.880 --> 17:45.400]  Okay.
[17:45.840 --> 17:46.860]  Two or higher.
[17:47.340 --> 17:48.740]  One, one, one.
[17:48.900 --> 17:49.160]  No!
[17:52.020 --> 17:54.120]  I hate this game!
[17:54.120 --> 17:55.020]  Why?
[17:57.800 --> 17:58.360]  Why?
[17:58.380 --> 17:59.680]  Why did this happen?
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.180]  What's it gonna be?
[18:13.760 --> 18:15.520]  No, no!
[18:16.760 --> 18:18.000]  So to make the world a more
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.020]  peaceful place, I've decided to divide everyone's
[18:20.020 --> 18:20.920]  coins evenly.
[18:20.920 --> 18:22.960]  It's a power revolution!
[18:24.160 --> 18:25.260]  I love this!
[18:25.900 --> 18:26.940]  Oh, it sucks!
[18:28.740 --> 18:30.120]  Oh, son of a bitch!
[18:30.540 --> 18:32.440]  I just got...
[18:32.440 --> 18:34.980]  Oh, man! I'm back in the game!
[18:37.440 --> 18:38.600]  Son of a bitch!
[18:39.060 --> 18:39.920]  Fucking celebrate.
[18:40.840 --> 18:43.040]  Oh, it's about to be chaos over here.
[18:43.340 --> 18:44.760]  All the flipping back and forth.
[18:46.060 --> 18:47.140]  I am so mad.
[18:47.200 --> 18:48.300]  I can't believe I didn't get there.
[18:49.340 --> 18:50.740]  Oh, Donkey Kong.
[18:52.080 --> 18:53.120]  Donkey Kong.
[18:53.700 --> 18:54.220]  DK...
[18:54.220 --> 18:55.360]  Not Bash.
[18:55.860 --> 18:58.520]  So they didn't really have anything in place to prevent repeat game types.
[18:58.600 --> 19:00.120]  Oh, no. Absolutely not.
[19:01.020 --> 19:01.480]  Have we?
[19:01.760 --> 19:04.060]  We've played one four-player game, right?
[19:04.680 --> 19:05.800]  Yeah, okay.
[19:07.800 --> 19:09.780]  We have a level 17 now.
[19:10.340 --> 19:11.040]  Oh, shit! I've got to concentrate.
[19:15.140 --> 19:15.900]  Give me that!
[19:15.900 --> 19:17.400]  Oh, come on!
[19:18.020 --> 19:18.600]  Ow!
[19:19.580 --> 19:20.500]  Oh, no!
[19:22.880 --> 19:23.900]  Don't do it again!
[19:24.060 --> 19:25.260]  I'm trying to get the...
[19:25.260 --> 19:27.360]  Give me this.
[19:27.920 --> 19:29.360]  No! I got it!
[19:29.480 --> 19:31.460]  Fuck off, Wario!
[19:33.780 --> 19:35.060]  I got you, bitch!
[19:35.740 --> 19:36.680]  Get away!
[19:38.820 --> 19:39.740]  Give me that!
[19:40.180 --> 19:41.460]  No! Oh, shit!
[19:42.860 --> 19:43.360]  Ooh.
[19:44.860 --> 19:45.760]  Did we all win?
[19:46.320 --> 19:46.860]  Let's see.
[19:48.260 --> 19:48.920]  Hell yeah.
[19:49.560 --> 19:50.240]  That's not bad.
[19:51.980 --> 19:53.480]  Why did they move us?
[19:53.660 --> 19:54.800]  We stayed the exact same.
[19:57.660 --> 20:00.220]  Was it like who collected that coin first or something?
[20:00.440 --> 20:00.620]  Alright.
[20:00.900 --> 20:02.360]  Need a nice big jump!
[20:02.560 --> 20:02.740]  No!
[20:04.580 --> 20:05.860]  Have I done it?
[20:06.260 --> 20:06.660]  Go right!
[20:06.660 --> 20:07.420]  Here we go.
[20:08.900 --> 20:09.340]  Yes!
[20:10.020 --> 20:10.340]  No!
[20:12.800 --> 20:13.240]  God!
[20:14.140 --> 20:15.800]  I should have counted. Why didn't I do that?
[20:18.580 --> 20:20.280]  Oh, my God! We had a new record!
[20:20.560 --> 20:22.840]  Nick got fucked by math again.
[20:23.020 --> 20:23.700]  It's flying!
[20:24.720 --> 20:25.680]  My greatest enemy.
[20:25.820 --> 20:27.880]  This is insane! Thank you so much!
[20:28.520 --> 20:29.680]  Yeah, thank y'all!
[20:30.480 --> 20:33.180]  If you don't get more than 90 points, Bowser will steal your coins.
[20:33.680 --> 20:34.200]  Oh, please.
[20:34.200 --> 20:35.380]  Don't want that.
[20:35.700 --> 20:36.900]  Move, grab, undo.
[20:40.620 --> 20:42.580]  It's the Mario 64 load screen.
[20:43.560 --> 20:44.840]  We just have to grab coins?
[20:45.380 --> 20:46.340]  No, we gotta...
[20:46.340 --> 20:47.380]  match the face.
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.340]  Oh, we gotta match the face.
[20:50.100 --> 20:50.560]  Oh, I see.
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.340]  I don't know why I helped you right there.
[20:54.420 --> 20:55.540]  Grab the coins.
[20:56.320 --> 20:57.520]  Yeah, go find them.
[20:58.820 --> 21:00.420]  Oh, God, he's got all sagged.
[21:01.260 --> 21:02.400]  Alright, which one's who?
[21:02.780 --> 21:03.900]  Okay, here we go.
[21:05.260 --> 21:06.080]  Oh, that's not it.
[21:06.080 --> 21:07.720]  Why can't I grab it? What am I doing?
[21:10.740 --> 21:11.100]  Oops.
[21:17.480 --> 21:18.580]  Well, this is not going well.
[21:18.580 --> 21:21.100]  Boy, the music is wigging out on mine, let me tell you.
[21:21.480 --> 21:22.880]  Is it going all like...
[21:28.400 --> 21:31.100]  Why can't I see this turd's eyes?
[21:33.860 --> 21:35.200]  Ah, shit, I muffed it.
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.200]  I screwed it.
[21:37.960 --> 21:38.460]  Yeah.
[21:39.200 --> 21:39.700]  No!
[21:40.820 --> 21:43.320]  God, this is bullshit.
[21:44.180 --> 21:44.500]  No!
[21:47.220 --> 21:48.220]  Holy shit.
[21:49.260 --> 21:50.100]  Oh, no!
[21:53.800 --> 21:55.160]  One, two, three, four...
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.560]  I need a five at least, is that right?
[21:57.140 --> 21:58.860]  Doesn't even matter for me now.
[21:59.740 --> 22:00.240]  Blam!
[22:01.100 --> 22:02.740]  Okay, no matter what, it wouldn't matter.
[22:02.740 --> 22:04.360]  It's all coming up, Gavin!
[22:04.880 --> 22:05.900]  Take me to the star!
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.440]  Although, now there's stars for the stealing.
[22:11.240 --> 22:13.040]  Oh, level 18!
[22:13.540 --> 22:14.320]  On the Hype Train.
[22:14.660 --> 22:16.220]  Good God, we're never gonna beat this record.
[22:16.860 --> 22:18.200]  Our Hype Train's legal.
[22:18.980 --> 22:19.500]  It's an adult.
[22:20.620 --> 22:22.680]  Thanks for everyone who's gifted subs and everything.
[22:23.220 --> 22:25.920]  Our Hype Train can drink in Europe.
[22:27.540 --> 22:29.180]  Can't drink in America yet, but...
[22:29.180 --> 22:30.040]  I mean, it's heading that way.
[22:30.680 --> 22:31.080]  Ah!
[22:31.900 --> 22:33.100]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[22:33.380 --> 22:34.560]  Depends on where you are, I guess.
[22:36.840 --> 22:37.400]  Somebody said,
[22:37.540 --> 22:38.760]  happy 40th birthday to Andrew.
[22:38.820 --> 22:39.260]  Hell yeah.
[22:41.040 --> 22:42.040]  We split the difference.
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.940]  I better get a 10 coin bonus when I get there.
[22:46.280 --> 22:46.760]  For what?
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.820]  For what?
[22:49.340 --> 22:50.960]  Hey, you got a star. Here's some money.
[22:51.680 --> 22:52.260]  Oh, man.
[22:54.540 --> 22:55.540]  You wanna hit A?
[22:55.980 --> 22:56.980]  Hey, Gavin, come on.
[22:56.980 --> 22:57.180]  I'm sorry.
[23:01.800 --> 23:02.400]  Oh!
[23:02.580 --> 23:03.180]  No!
[23:03.980 --> 23:06.560]  No! I don't have the coins!
[23:08.280 --> 23:09.940]  I don't have the coins either!
[23:10.080 --> 23:11.140]  I don't have the coins!
[23:12.280 --> 23:14.360]  Akira101 with a shitload of gifted subs.
[23:14.700 --> 23:15.860]  Oh, thank you.
[23:18.580 --> 23:19.180]  Oh!
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.220]  I got there!
[23:22.220 --> 23:24.700]  Save up 20 coins and come back.
[23:24.700 --> 23:25.660]  So close.
[23:27.440 --> 23:27.960]  And...
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.640]  Oh, that means I'm fucked!
[23:30.380 --> 23:30.900]  Zernick!
[23:32.100 --> 23:33.460]  Give me my 10 coin bonus!
[23:34.300 --> 23:35.120]  I've already met!
[23:35.660 --> 23:36.720]  Hey, you got enough coins now.
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.120]  Yeah.
[23:40.260 --> 23:40.780]  Okay.
[23:41.700 --> 23:42.860]  Hey, could you roll a 1?
[23:43.560 --> 23:46.380]  Or a 4? Or just perfectly in between?
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.160]  That'd be great.
[23:48.160 --> 23:48.540]  Oh!
[23:48.800 --> 23:49.020]  Oh!
[23:49.020 --> 23:49.580]  Oh!
[23:49.620 --> 23:50.220]  Oh!
[23:51.080 --> 23:51.680]  Oh!
[23:52.780 --> 23:52.960]  Oh!
[23:53.280 --> 23:53.520]  Oh!
[23:56.760 --> 24:00.200]  What do I do?
[24:00.860 --> 24:02.900]  Coins fall down in a shower
[24:02.900 --> 24:03.760]  on the flower.
[24:05.060 --> 24:05.360]  Alright.
[24:06.060 --> 24:07.760]  We gotta move boat.
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.080]  Move boat.
[24:10.360 --> 24:11.620]  Dude, I'll move boat.
[24:12.560 --> 24:14.460]  I'll move boat like you wouldn't believe.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.140]  I'm gonna move a lot of boat here.
[24:16.680 --> 24:17.080]  Hey!
[24:19.080 --> 24:20.480]  I'm just gonna stay on this side.
[24:21.680 --> 24:22.920]  Tip some shit in my boat.
[24:23.460 --> 24:24.260]  No, it's going that way.
[24:24.420 --> 24:24.860]  Oh, shit.
[24:26.240 --> 24:27.240]  Oh, hell yeah!
[24:27.580 --> 24:28.520]  He almost went off!
[24:30.220 --> 24:31.160]  Yeah, fall off.
[24:32.220 --> 24:34.060]  How do I create a roadblock?
[24:34.200 --> 24:34.660]  Oh, I might have enough!
[24:35.700 --> 24:38.300]  It's like we're trying to catch home run balls in San Francisco.
[24:39.920 --> 24:41.460]  It's like we're in a Giants game.
[24:41.820 --> 24:43.940]  I'm getting dregs! I'm getting nothing!
[24:43.940 --> 24:44.800]  It's shit!
[24:46.740 --> 24:48.060]  He's getting everything!
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.240]  It's my money!
[24:49.740 --> 24:50.560]  Give me that!
[24:52.060 --> 24:53.040]  Oh, God!
[24:54.320 --> 24:55.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[24:55.740 --> 24:57.240]  Yes, I got all the money!
[24:57.820 --> 24:59.380]  Nick got so much money!
[25:00.200 --> 25:00.940]  So much money!
[25:00.960 --> 25:01.940]  Let me at least get a coin.
[25:05.480 --> 25:06.380]  30 coins!
[25:07.080 --> 25:07.900]  I got one!
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.500]  I got dregs!
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.180]  Oh, please have Bowser steal all your shit now.
[25:18.460 --> 25:20.160]  Oh, I'm going to be so upset!
[25:21.180 --> 25:21.940]  Hey, buddy!
[25:25.860 --> 25:27.300]  What does he do?
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.160]  He gives you a black star?
[25:29.580 --> 25:30.240]  What is that?
[25:30.560 --> 25:32.140]  Mario's like, what the fuck?
[25:32.680 --> 25:34.940]  There's a hip hop group in the early 2000s.
[25:35.380 --> 25:37.060]  It'll cost 40 points!
[25:37.620 --> 25:37.840]  No!
[25:37.840 --> 25:38.940]  Nick has three!
[25:39.100 --> 25:41.020]  Nick has three points if he starts!
[25:41.440 --> 25:42.560]  You got ripped off!
[25:42.700 --> 25:45.860]  You got a 3D printed star, piece of shit!
[25:49.500 --> 25:50.780]  You fell for it!
[25:51.500 --> 25:52.880]  I'm going to take the rest of your coins!
[25:54.020 --> 25:54.140]  Fuck.
[25:56.560 --> 25:57.440]  Level 19!
[25:57.960 --> 25:58.560]  On the hype train!
[25:59.920 --> 26:00.660]  That is insane!
[26:01.660 --> 26:03.640]  Our hype train is almost in its 20s!
[26:04.920 --> 26:05.400]  Oh, an item!
[26:05.400 --> 26:07.640]  Thank you so much, everyone!
[26:08.240 --> 26:08.820]  Ah, piss!
[26:09.400 --> 26:10.560]  Poisonous mushroom!
[26:10.780 --> 26:12.380]  I hope it kills your star.
[26:12.740 --> 26:14.600]  I got chlamydia.
[26:15.680 --> 26:15.940]  Oh, no!
[26:18.960 --> 26:19.380]  Fuck!
[26:20.560 --> 26:21.380]  It's okay.
[26:21.960 --> 26:23.760]  I'm slowly getting there.
[26:25.140 --> 26:26.100]  Hey, it's a me!
[26:26.940 --> 26:27.620]  It's a you!
[26:28.240 --> 26:28.920]  It's a two!
[26:30.480 --> 26:31.400]  Ooh, four player.
[26:31.480 --> 26:32.240]  Oh, we got four player.
[26:33.280 --> 26:34.360]  Skateboard scamper!
[26:35.300 --> 26:36.260]  Crazy cutter!
[26:41.230 --> 26:42.690]  What turn are we on?
[26:43.310 --> 26:45.970]  Cut the fossilized characters free.
[26:46.090 --> 26:47.170]  Oh, hell yeah.
[26:47.270 --> 26:49.690]  If you cover up half the screen,
[26:50.130 --> 26:51.590]  it's quite the visual.
[26:54.170 --> 26:56.250]  Look at how Mario has to do it.
[26:56.970 --> 26:58.270]  I feel like DK's really good.
[27:00.230 --> 27:01.410]  Geoff, collect the coins.
[27:01.930 --> 27:02.830]  Yeah, I'll collect the coins.
[27:05.050 --> 27:06.890]  I can't stop collecting these coins!
[27:07.410 --> 27:11.850]  Oh, I've taken that a bit wide.
[27:12.350 --> 27:13.470]  Oh, dear.
[27:14.070 --> 27:20.340]  God, Mario's having the time of his life, though.
[27:23.100 --> 27:28.240]  Oh, I think I did pretty good.
[27:29.640 --> 27:30.280]  Yes!
[27:30.940 --> 27:32.400]  Gavin, you know what?
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.700]  It's this netcode.
[27:33.700 --> 27:34.540]  That's what it is.
[27:34.680 --> 27:35.280]  Netcode!
[27:36.440 --> 27:39.060]  Oh, everyone won except Andrew?
[27:39.180 --> 27:39.460]  No!
[27:41.400 --> 27:42.000]  Dang.
[27:42.980 --> 27:43.980]  I needed those coins!
[27:50.460 --> 27:53.020]  I'm about to eat my time, so sad.
[27:55.620 --> 27:57.340]  Oh, big tens, love it.
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.460]  Big ten.
[28:00.200 --> 28:00.700]  Huh.
[28:01.540 --> 28:03.260]  Oh, I've got my gammy mushroom.
[28:03.340 --> 28:04.080]  I think it's you, lazy.
[28:04.240 --> 28:04.700]  You're still sick!
[28:05.140 --> 28:07.860]  Oh, I didn't even get to go?
[28:08.260 --> 28:08.980]  That's bullshit!
[28:09.880 --> 28:12.440]  I thought I'd be rolling low or something.
[28:12.560 --> 28:13.660]  I just sat here?
[28:15.580 --> 28:16.640]  Alright, here we go.
[28:17.120 --> 28:17.380]  Yay!
[28:20.420 --> 28:21.840]  Oh, Geoff's about to get on the board.
[28:22.460 --> 28:24.820]  If I get back around to fucking Bowser.
[28:25.720 --> 28:26.720]  Uh, yes!
[28:27.260 --> 28:28.620]  I guess I would.
[28:29.980 --> 28:30.500]  Okay.
[28:30.720 --> 28:31.640]  Well, thank you.
[28:33.180 --> 28:34.220]  I'll take that.
[28:35.340 --> 28:35.780]  Alright.
[28:36.040 --> 28:38.220]  Don't you look at me like that, Wolf Luigi, you piece of shit.
[28:40.320 --> 28:41.420]  Somebody else's turn.
[28:45.610 --> 28:46.770]  What a fun game.
[28:48.670 --> 28:49.710]  Another ten coins!
[28:50.010 --> 28:50.850]  I get another coin!
[28:52.690 --> 28:53.090]  Oh!
[28:53.530 --> 28:55.470]  Oh, you might have saved the farm!
[28:57.170 --> 28:57.550]  Switch up.
[28:59.750 --> 29:01.070]  Is it gonna be Geoff?
[29:01.130 --> 29:02.190]  Oh, another four player.
[29:04.770 --> 29:05.450]  Bumper balls!
[29:05.590 --> 29:05.930]  Bumper balls!
[29:06.570 --> 29:06.810]  Yeah!
[29:09.330 --> 29:10.470]  That never happens.
[29:13.690 --> 29:14.170]  Oh!
[29:15.830 --> 29:16.930]  I remember this.
[29:17.190 --> 29:19.870]  Ride your bull and bump the others.
[29:20.170 --> 29:20.650]  Let's do it.
[29:22.530 --> 29:23.350]  There's no buttons.
[29:23.490 --> 29:24.670]  I think you just run.
[29:25.590 --> 29:26.870]  Get bumped!
[29:28.430 --> 29:28.930]  Oh!
[29:31.910 --> 29:32.330]  Pull him!
[29:33.030 --> 29:34.330]  Not me!
[29:35.730 --> 29:36.610]  It has to be you!
[29:37.030 --> 29:37.210]  Oh!
[29:38.510 --> 29:39.350]  Oh!
[29:39.750 --> 29:39.950]  Oh!
[29:42.350 --> 29:43.190]  No!
[29:43.650 --> 29:44.010]  No!
[29:46.870 --> 29:48.010]  Don't let go!
[29:49.010 --> 29:50.530]  He's right on the edge!
[29:51.550 --> 29:51.830]  No!
[29:51.830 --> 29:52.550]  Don't let me go!
[29:52.750 --> 29:54.410]  Hit me into him!
[29:57.390 --> 29:58.930]  I'm getting minced!
[30:03.790 --> 30:05.910]  Happy birthday, son!
[30:08.830 --> 30:11.750]  You guys are really hanging in there.
[30:12.170 --> 30:15.110]  Come on!
[30:15.910 --> 30:16.910]  Go, DK!
[30:18.190 --> 30:19.090]  Uh-oh, DK!
[30:19.090 --> 30:19.650]  DK!
[30:21.110 --> 30:23.270]  It went so wide!
[30:23.530 --> 30:24.930]  I was trying to generate speed!
[30:25.830 --> 30:27.630]  Huffy break with the five gifted subs.
[30:27.730 --> 30:28.750]  Thank you very much.
[30:29.250 --> 30:30.410]  God damn it!
[30:33.550 --> 30:33.790]  Oh!
[30:34.710 --> 30:35.750]  That was tense.
[30:36.850 --> 30:38.570]  I like the internet struggling with that one.
[30:39.650 --> 30:40.970]  What bloody turn is it?
[30:43.750 --> 30:45.610]  Oh yeah, how do we figure out what turn we're on?
[30:47.270 --> 30:48.370]  That's a great question.
[30:48.590 --> 30:49.990]  I don't know.
[30:50.230 --> 30:52.490]  Jesus, we're on level 19!
[30:53.150 --> 30:54.110]  That's insane.
[30:54.750 --> 30:55.370]  Wow, 20!
[30:55.730 --> 30:57.310]  We can almost drink in the US.
[31:02.980 --> 31:05.100]  Let's see, what's five away?
[31:05.580 --> 31:05.960]  Nothing.
[31:10.220 --> 31:13.440]  Yeah, the music is muffed on mine.
[31:14.820 --> 31:15.700]  Oh, me too, man.
[31:19.320 --> 31:19.940]  God damn it.
[31:21.920 --> 31:23.280]  I'm not going anywhere.
[31:24.320 --> 31:25.460]  God damn it.
[31:25.520 --> 31:26.780]  Oh, it's Geoff again.
[31:28.380 --> 31:30.800]  Are we ever going to get a 2v2 in this game?
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.280]  No! Not again!
[31:32.780 --> 31:34.200]  Not again, but come!
[31:34.440 --> 31:36.400]  This one's impossible. I'm going to get a power drill.
[31:37.120 --> 31:37.740]  It's definitely clockwise.
[31:42.780 --> 31:43.520]  It's clockwise.
[31:44.220 --> 31:47.360]  Oh, apparently we can drink in Japan.
[31:47.360 --> 31:47.840]  That's good.
[31:48.220 --> 31:49.460]  Come on!
[31:51.050 --> 31:52.060]  We can do it!
[31:57.340 --> 31:59.530]  Get ready for the finish!
[32:00.260 --> 32:01.560]  Here it comes!
[32:04.880 --> 32:05.980]  Open up!
[32:06.560 --> 32:07.880]  It's raining down on you!
[32:09.520 --> 32:12.180]  I'm your god now!
[32:12.180 --> 32:15.560]  What the fuck?
[32:16.540 --> 32:17.900]  That was great, thanks.
[32:18.840 --> 32:19.300]  Jesus.
[32:20.580 --> 32:21.540]  I can be your Jesus.
[32:22.360 --> 32:23.280]  Candy Desk Official.
[32:23.760 --> 32:24.940]  Looks like 10 subs.
[32:25.940 --> 32:26.700]  Thank you very much.
[32:27.220 --> 32:32.240]  Okay, I'm glad I'm in the back now.
[32:32.960 --> 32:33.520]  Yeah, great.
[32:33.600 --> 32:34.620]  You like it in the back, got it.
[32:35.880 --> 32:37.700]  Oh, my hand is...
[32:37.700 --> 32:39.420]  My palm is destroyed.
[32:40.400 --> 32:41.480]  Yeah, my hand hurts.
[32:41.840 --> 32:43.000]  We've already done that twice.
[32:46.080 --> 32:48.140]  Who's out right now? Is it Toad or Bows?
[32:48.860 --> 32:49.260]  Bows.
[32:50.140 --> 32:50.720]  Oh, shit.
[32:52.080 --> 32:53.860]  Yeah, I just switched it to Bows.
[32:56.800 --> 32:56.960]  What?
[32:59.600 --> 33:01.500]  You have the most coins!
[33:01.660 --> 33:02.480]  You have the most!
[33:02.500 --> 33:04.060]  Why are you shocked by that?
[33:06.520 --> 33:07.320]  It's harsh!
[33:08.420 --> 33:09.540]  It's unfair!
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.680]  Take your lumps, money man!
[33:12.940 --> 33:13.980]  Take your lumps!
[33:16.380 --> 33:18.520]  I've got a lump life, what are you on about?
[33:21.080 --> 33:22.420]  That's a lump life.
[33:25.180 --> 33:26.380]  Take my lumps!
[33:28.160 --> 33:28.720]  2v2!
[33:29.540 --> 33:30.400]  Oh, well, who is it?
[33:30.580 --> 33:31.840]  Enemies are now friends.
[33:32.660 --> 33:34.460]  Yeah, we got a bobsled.
[33:35.280 --> 33:36.520]  We're team birthday boy.
[33:36.580 --> 33:37.700]  I'm the boy, you're the birthday.
[33:41.400 --> 33:43.480]  Team up with another player for a bobsled.
[33:43.660 --> 33:44.880]  Push the sled to start.
[33:45.020 --> 33:46.560]  Just get ready to mash that A.
[33:47.100 --> 33:49.120]  So we just have to mash A.
[33:50.360 --> 33:52.280]  We're gonna mash...
[33:52.280 --> 33:53.720]  Oh, let's see, I'm pushing it already.
[33:53.860 --> 33:54.420]  I'm already moving.
[33:55.500 --> 33:56.360]  You got this.
[33:56.920 --> 33:59.720]  Go, go, go!
[34:00.360 --> 34:01.040]  Go, go, go!
[34:01.040 --> 34:03.540]  Oh, we're so much faster than they are!
[34:04.100 --> 34:06.060]  Do we still press A, or is that it?
[34:06.440 --> 34:07.200]  Oh, hold forward!
[34:07.920 --> 34:09.340]  Oh, we blew our lead!
[34:10.240 --> 34:10.860]  That's a blow.
[34:12.520 --> 34:13.540]  We got this.
[34:14.120 --> 34:14.580]  Inside line!
[34:15.660 --> 34:16.500]  Oh no!
[34:19.460 --> 34:20.620]  I got removed.
[34:21.480 --> 34:21.780]  No!
[34:22.460 --> 34:23.600]  From the whole game?
[34:23.800 --> 34:24.060]  Yeah.
[34:26.100 --> 34:26.620]  No!
[34:26.620 --> 34:28.120]  Oh, Geoff!
[34:29.200 --> 34:30.520]  You need to get off Wi-Fi.
[34:31.000 --> 34:31.980]  I'm not on Wi-Fi!
[34:32.180 --> 34:33.040]  I'm plugged in!
[34:35.780 --> 34:36.700]  I get like
[34:36.700 --> 34:38.180]  800 down up here!
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.320]  Well, it just went down.
[34:40.520 --> 34:41.220]  Well, it went down.
[34:42.020 --> 34:44.280]  The only way to do that would be to go downstairs
[34:44.280 --> 34:45.380]  to my living room.
[34:46.260 --> 34:48.600]  I don't know how I'd do that.
[34:50.120 --> 34:50.840]  Oh no!
[34:51.040 --> 34:52.340]  Hold on, let's just win this race
[34:52.340 --> 34:53.120]  and then we'll figure it out.
[34:53.120 --> 34:54.820]  I'll invite you again.
[34:54.980 --> 34:57.200]  Why don't you guys hold back on the
[34:57.200 --> 34:59.140]  stick, just to give us a fair shot
[34:59.140 --> 34:59.540]  here.
[35:00.600 --> 35:01.520]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[35:02.160 --> 35:03.260]  Okay, you're not doing that.
[35:05.220 --> 35:06.200]  I'm off the stick.
[35:08.300 --> 35:09.180]  I'm holding
[35:09.180 --> 35:09.940]  back on the stick.
[35:10.040 --> 35:12.000]  Yeah, I'm holding as far back as I can.
[35:13.240 --> 35:15.240]  Why don't you hold left into the wall?
[35:15.380 --> 35:16.560]  I'm worried the stick is going to break.
[35:16.760 --> 35:17.100]  No!
[35:19.460 --> 35:19.900]  Dammit!
[35:20.960 --> 35:21.520]  Alright.
[35:22.520 --> 35:23.500]  Let's get Geoff.
[35:23.900 --> 35:24.480]  Easy peasy.
[35:26.400 --> 35:27.380]  We did it.
[35:27.460 --> 35:27.700]  Alright.
[35:29.260 --> 35:31.320]  Thanks for the help everyone in chat.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.740]  So Bowser is out, yeah?
[35:34.920 --> 35:35.880]  I think so.
[35:40.200 --> 35:42.100]  You can see if you go up to the tower.
[35:42.600 --> 35:43.040]  Who's up there?
[35:45.120 --> 35:45.860]  Oh yeah, that's Bowser.
[35:55.340 --> 35:56.020]  You know what?
[35:57.080 --> 35:57.600]  Yeah.
[35:58.680 --> 35:59.880]  Nick said yeah.
[36:00.080 --> 36:00.880]  Yeah.
[36:01.240 --> 36:02.540]  What does that do? I don't know.
[36:02.600 --> 36:04.140]  Oh no Nick!
[36:05.340 --> 36:06.080]  Oh shit!
[36:06.440 --> 36:08.660]  You can take stars!
[36:10.140 --> 36:11.820]  There are now stars on the board.
[36:13.340 --> 36:13.680]  Ah!
[36:13.900 --> 36:14.300]  Dammit!
[36:15.320 --> 36:16.000]  That code!
[36:18.780 --> 36:20.400]  Oh come on!
[36:22.380 --> 36:22.920]  Yeah!
[36:24.320 --> 36:25.060]  Yeah!
[36:25.060 --> 36:25.480]  Yeah!
[36:27.220 --> 36:27.700]  Woo!
[36:30.460 --> 36:31.340]  Thanks Nick!
[36:31.920 --> 36:33.860]  I could have just gone the other way.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.360]  Oh, you don't have any money now.
[36:35.380 --> 36:36.100]  I have nothing!
[36:37.140 --> 36:39.560]  I can't believe our hype train
[36:39.560 --> 36:41.520]  is at a bar getting drunk right now legally.
[36:41.680 --> 36:42.240]  That's awesome.
[36:42.560 --> 36:43.680]  I wish I was with him.
[36:43.780 --> 36:44.320]  Good for it.
[36:47.940 --> 36:48.420]  Oh!
[36:53.850 --> 36:55.190]  I'm going the long way.
[36:56.150 --> 36:57.190]  Getting them coins.
[36:57.990 --> 36:58.590]  I don't know.
[37:01.290 --> 37:01.770]  Oh!
[37:04.290 --> 37:07.770]  Oh, this is stressful.
[37:07.930 --> 37:09.670]  I don't want to pay $40 for a dud.
[37:10.870 --> 37:12.070]  We're all ending up
[37:12.070 --> 37:12.790]  over here again.
[37:13.170 --> 37:13.710]  It's a cluster.
[37:15.130 --> 37:16.530]  Yeah, I don't want that again either.
[37:19.210 --> 37:20.290]  Nick has lost
[37:20.290 --> 37:21.510]  the most money by far.
[37:23.170 --> 37:23.650]  Money!
[37:24.370 --> 37:24.710]  Hope!
[37:24.710 --> 37:27.150]  All right.
[37:27.150 --> 37:28.150]  Mario Bandstand.
[37:28.530 --> 37:29.810]  Be part of the bandstand.
[37:29.950 --> 37:32.710]  Play instruments
[37:32.710 --> 37:33.230]  with A.
[37:33.750 --> 37:34.030]  Okay.
[37:37.890 --> 37:38.630]  It's play
[37:38.630 --> 37:40.510]  each time so play as the cursor lines up.
[37:41.930 --> 37:42.290]  Oh.
[37:43.670 --> 37:44.910]  How do I mess you up?
[37:49.820 --> 37:50.380]  What?
[37:51.900 --> 37:53.120]  Thank you so much
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.320]  B-Manny and MetalMuse18 for the subs.
[37:55.320 --> 37:57.440]  Did you say MetalMuse18?
[37:58.060 --> 37:58.400]  Yep.
[37:58.520 --> 37:59.400]  That's what I said.
[38:01.940 --> 38:02.680]  MetalMuse18.
[38:06.320 --> 38:06.480]  What?
[38:06.720 --> 38:08.180]  I don't know what's happening.
[38:09.000 --> 38:09.740]  Oh.
[38:12.720 --> 38:13.960]  What did I do?
[38:17.120 --> 38:21.310]  What the...
[38:21.310 --> 38:21.950]  Okay.
[38:23.630 --> 38:24.370]  Jesus.
[38:25.010 --> 38:26.530]  I don't...
[38:26.530 --> 38:27.590]  Oh, there's so many!
[38:29.210 --> 38:30.090]  Ah!
[38:31.150 --> 38:32.030]  So...
[38:32.030 --> 38:33.630]  Did I do well or bad?
[38:34.190 --> 38:34.830]  I don't know.
[38:34.830 --> 38:36.390]  Every single one!
[38:36.770 --> 38:37.650]  What am I doing?
[38:38.550 --> 38:39.030]  What?
[38:39.430 --> 38:40.310]  Okay.
[38:42.650 --> 38:44.150]  That was hard work by me.
[38:44.470 --> 38:45.050]  Good lord.
[38:46.110 --> 38:46.390]  What?
[38:47.350 --> 38:48.130]  What?
[38:49.810 --> 38:51.570]  Now I...
[38:51.570 --> 38:52.830]  Oh.
[38:53.390 --> 38:53.870]  Oh.
[38:58.050 --> 38:59.590]  I got nothing, man.
[38:59.670 --> 39:00.930]  You can't take anything from me.
[39:01.370 --> 39:03.330]  You can't break me. I'm already broken.
[39:03.470 --> 39:05.730]  You can't get milk from a turnip.
[39:07.210 --> 39:07.730]  Oh, good.
[39:08.050 --> 39:09.070]  That helped.
[39:09.430 --> 39:10.010]  Who's close?
[39:11.870 --> 39:13.810]  Are you within reaching distance, Gavin?
[39:14.570 --> 39:15.950]  Hey, man. You got ten coins.
[39:16.570 --> 39:17.010]  I think so.
[39:20.680 --> 39:21.160]  Maybe.
[39:21.160 --> 39:21.260]  Maybe.
[39:21.660 --> 39:23.280]  Maybe it's a real high roll.
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.700]  Oh my god.
[39:29.180 --> 39:29.460]  Alright.
[39:33.140 --> 39:35.280]  Alright, you gotta close your eyes and hit the middle one.
[39:35.940 --> 39:36.260]  Yeah.
[39:39.500 --> 39:40.060]  No!
[39:45.210 --> 39:46.230]  I can't reach.
[39:46.230 --> 39:46.750]  I'm too short.
[39:48.490 --> 39:49.050]  Alright.
[39:49.410 --> 39:50.790]  This doesn't concern me at all.
[39:53.290 --> 39:54.410]  Come on!
[39:54.410 --> 39:54.790]  Come on!
[39:55.330 --> 39:57.050]  You son of a bitch!
[39:59.230 --> 40:00.490]  I'll take it.
[40:01.090 --> 40:01.850]  Fuck!
[40:03.910 --> 40:05.910]  I had plans with those coins.
[40:07.390 --> 40:11.380]  At least you have coins.
[40:12.280 --> 40:13.700]  You have thirteen.
[40:14.800 --> 40:15.360]  Oh, yeah.
[40:15.980 --> 40:17.800]  God damn it! I can't go anywhere!
[40:21.240 --> 40:22.480]  Fucking game.
[40:25.120 --> 40:26.300]  Hey, happy birthday, man.
[40:26.440 --> 40:27.300]  Thanks, man.
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.080]  Hey, four player.
[40:31.840 --> 40:32.780]  Hey, four player.
[40:34.220 --> 40:35.160]  Skateboard scamper.
[40:35.440 --> 40:37.120]  Oh, we scamping.
[40:38.420 --> 40:39.980]  We're scamping and scrumping.
[40:44.320 --> 40:47.120]  The floor beneath you breaks up as players scamper across.
[40:47.260 --> 40:49.900]  Best B repeatedly to skate and A to jump.
[40:50.200 --> 40:50.400]  Okay.
[40:50.400 --> 40:53.780]  Why can't we just use the controller?
[40:56.480 --> 40:56.840]  Alright.
[40:57.360 --> 40:58.080]  What was it?
[40:58.600 --> 41:00.620]  B to skate and A to jump.
[41:01.340 --> 41:02.480]  Tap B, is that right?
[41:02.600 --> 41:02.700]  Yeah.
[41:03.780 --> 41:05.620]  Oh, I got the MVP advantage.
[41:06.680 --> 41:08.320]  I got that MVP advantage.
[41:08.480 --> 41:09.000]  No!
[41:12.620 --> 41:14.660]  Did I need to jump that last one?
[41:19.290 --> 41:20.490]  Oh, balls!
[41:20.490 --> 41:21.490]  I missed the coin.
[41:22.110 --> 41:23.490]  Go, go, go!
[41:23.690 --> 41:30.130]  Go, go, go!
[41:30.370 --> 41:30.990]  No, Mario!
[41:31.590 --> 41:32.930]  Come on!
[41:34.790 --> 41:37.490]  Oh, my...
[41:37.490 --> 41:37.910]  No!
[41:39.470 --> 41:40.510]  God, no!
[41:42.410 --> 41:43.250]  Bullshit!
[41:44.770 --> 41:45.470]  How?
[41:46.450 --> 41:48.330]  And DK plays second?
[41:50.610 --> 41:51.850]  I got the coin bag.
[41:52.450 --> 41:54.390]  Did you lean forward with your chest?
[41:54.570 --> 41:56.270]  Was it like a Noah Lyles situation?
[42:08.780 --> 42:11.720]  Well, this is going to end poorly.
[42:13.960 --> 42:14.400]  No!
[42:15.100 --> 42:16.140]  I thought it was Bowser.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.760]  Oh, I thought it was Bowser too. When did that change?
[42:19.260 --> 42:20.940]  When I went through and had nothing.
[42:21.360 --> 42:21.980]  Oh, yeah!
[42:23.720 --> 42:24.560]  Oh, no.
[42:26.560 --> 42:27.980]  Oh, Gavin's a real problem.
[42:29.540 --> 42:30.320]  Well, shit.
[42:35.600 --> 42:36.500]  You dick.
[42:37.400 --> 42:38.300]  I cannot believe it.
[42:38.300 --> 42:38.580]  What do you mean?
[42:38.940 --> 42:39.840]  I gotta go next.
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.480]  Take your ten coins.
[42:47.260 --> 42:47.700]  Shit, son.
[42:49.460 --> 42:50.960]  Oh, for God's sake.
[42:51.080 --> 42:53.860]  I just get to play with myself?
[42:54.760 --> 42:55.600]  Sure do.
[42:56.420 --> 42:57.680]  In a game called Ground Pound.
[42:57.720 --> 42:59.960]  You get the ground to pound yourself all day, buddy.
[42:59.960 --> 43:06.520]  It dropped into the flattop post.
[43:06.680 --> 43:09.440]  Try to remember which are flat and which are pointy.
[43:09.600 --> 43:10.420]  Oh, dear.
[43:13.240 --> 43:14.640]  Look beneath the butterflies
[43:14.640 --> 43:16.100]  and you'll see parts of the post.
[43:17.740 --> 43:18.300]  Okay.
[43:19.960 --> 43:20.660]  Oh, dear.
[43:22.340 --> 43:23.720]  That seems easy.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.540]  A very memorable pattern.
[43:28.540 --> 43:29.540]  What's the Z button?
[43:30.980 --> 43:31.540]  Oh.
[43:31.880 --> 43:32.180]  That's the Z button.
[43:32.180 --> 43:32.780]  That's a good question.
[43:32.900 --> 43:34.800]  Yeah, it's for you to find out, I think.
[43:35.380 --> 43:36.020]  Oh, I found it.
[43:36.300 --> 43:37.680]  I got makeup for last time.
[43:38.540 --> 43:39.940]  Even my kid could do this.
[43:41.940 --> 43:43.820]  Miss. Miss. Miss one.
[43:44.420 --> 43:45.000]  Miss one.
[43:46.260 --> 43:46.700]  Wow.
[43:47.120 --> 43:50.140]  You spent the first ten seconds just fucks it about
[43:50.140 --> 43:51.660]  and you still had sentences
[43:52.180 --> 43:53.000]  left on the clock.
[43:59.750 --> 44:01.030]  I agree, Geoff.
[44:01.590 --> 44:02.530]  Well said.
[44:06.120 --> 44:07.120]  Okay, low roll.
[44:08.380 --> 44:09.240]  Don't want to get there.
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.040]  Okay, I'm going this way.
[44:12.500 --> 44:13.460]  God damn it.
[44:16.300 --> 44:18.100]  Oh, yes. Yes. Yes.
[44:19.320 --> 44:20.520]  Metal Mew said this game is
[44:20.520 --> 44:21.380]  made for kids.
[44:23.020 --> 44:23.540]  Hey.
[44:24.200 --> 44:25.340]  My kid's three.
[44:25.340 --> 44:25.980]  They don't know anything.
[44:32.510 --> 44:35.130]  Oh no. This just got
[44:35.130 --> 44:36.050]  interesting.
[44:37.590 --> 44:39.150]  So interesting.
[44:39.490 --> 44:39.530]  Oh.
[44:40.850 --> 44:42.390]  Geoff, I'm so sorry.
[44:43.070 --> 44:44.050]  It better not go to Gavin.
[44:45.670 --> 44:45.710]  No.
[44:47.210 --> 44:47.990]  No.
[44:49.130 --> 44:49.510]  Yes.
[44:51.230 --> 44:53.050]  What have you done?
[44:53.270 --> 44:54.950]  This game sucks.
[44:54.950 --> 44:57.190]  This game rules.
[44:58.050 --> 44:58.830]  What the...
[44:58.830 --> 45:00.990]  Candy Disc Official with a shitload
[45:00.990 --> 45:02.890]  more gifted stuff. I didn't even see how many that was.
[45:02.970 --> 45:03.770]  Oh my god.
[45:04.590 --> 45:06.390]  What have you done?
[45:06.910 --> 45:07.430]  This sucks.
[45:09.090 --> 45:10.390]  It feels like...
[45:10.390 --> 45:12.130]  I wonder if this is what it's like to be Michael.
[45:15.970 --> 45:16.830]  Alright, Geoff.
[45:17.110 --> 45:18.490]  We need to roll a one.
[45:18.570 --> 45:18.870]  Alright.
[45:19.970 --> 45:21.050]  For your own safety.
[45:21.050 --> 45:21.290]  Three.
[45:23.970 --> 45:25.010]  Hold on.
[45:25.090 --> 45:26.650]  My controller desynced.
[45:27.250 --> 45:28.330]  God damn it.
[45:29.510 --> 45:30.050]  What do I do?
[45:30.550 --> 45:31.770]  Can I plug it in?
[45:32.130 --> 45:35.230]  There we go.
[45:39.650 --> 45:40.830]  All of that
[45:40.830 --> 45:41.730]  just to get the Bowser.
[45:43.410 --> 45:44.430]  I'm really sorry.
[45:44.710 --> 45:45.350]  Yeah, man.
[45:47.410 --> 45:49.030]  If it helps, I know you're
[45:49.030 --> 45:49.330]  in pain.
[45:55.110 --> 45:57.130]  Why is this fucking controller
[45:57.130 --> 45:59.030]  syncing? I just plug it into the side, right?
[46:00.110 --> 46:00.810]  The side of what?
[46:01.230 --> 46:03.230]  The base station?
[46:04.110 --> 46:05.290]  Where there's two USB ports
[46:05.290 --> 46:05.730]  on the side?
[46:06.690 --> 46:08.070]  It's got blue lights on it.
[46:09.030 --> 46:09.670]  Stick it in that.
[46:16.110 --> 46:17.910]  What is Geoff talking about?
[46:17.910 --> 46:20.130]  He's trying to...
[46:20.130 --> 46:21.550]  Wait, does he have
[46:21.550 --> 46:22.790]  a different controller?
[46:23.890 --> 46:26.390]  Can you post a picture of your second controller, Geoff?
[46:26.470 --> 46:27.130]  Are you guys still there?
[46:28.250 --> 46:28.730]  Yeah, we're here.
[46:31.370 --> 46:32.070]  Are you?
[46:32.550 --> 46:33.970]  You're sounding a bit robot-y
[46:33.970 --> 46:34.910]  like you're on Wi-Fi.
[46:37.690 --> 46:39.890]  Now I've lost you guys. God damn it.
[46:40.490 --> 46:41.590]  Now we're here!
[46:42.230 --> 46:43.350]  We're right here!
[46:43.730 --> 46:45.690]  It says controller not connecting
[46:45.690 --> 46:47.410]  and then it just says single
[46:48.250 --> 46:49.430]  press L and R
[46:49.430 --> 46:50.970]  on the controller, and I'm doing that.
[46:55.110 --> 46:56.030]  Try plugging
[46:56.030 --> 46:56.990]  the controller
[46:56.990 --> 46:58.730]  into the dock?
[46:59.050 --> 46:59.210]  Yeah.
[47:03.630 --> 47:05.850]  Are you using like a ProSwitch
[47:05.850 --> 47:06.210]  controller?
[47:07.330 --> 47:09.870]  It's just like a third-party one, but it's got lights on it.
[47:10.570 --> 47:11.330]  And the lights are on?
[47:11.610 --> 47:11.750]  Yeah.
[47:13.610 --> 47:14.050]  No,
[47:14.090 --> 47:15.690]  it has lights on it, they just aren't any.
[47:16.410 --> 47:17.470]  But I know that it does...
[47:17.470 --> 47:18.430]  No, of course the lights are on.
[47:19.850 --> 47:21.930]  Somebody's saying don't press hold LR.
[47:23.070 --> 47:23.950]  Oh, okay.
[47:26.590 --> 47:26.870]  Okay.
[47:29.970 --> 47:30.370]  Okay.
[47:32.070 --> 47:33.490]  Not Benson Malone says
[47:33.490 --> 47:35.470]  is technical difficulty music property of RT?
[47:35.590 --> 47:37.590]  I assume that was some royalty-free
[47:37.590 --> 47:39.950]  piece of shit, but I'm not entirely sure.
[47:39.950 --> 47:41.210]  Oh, yeah.
[47:41.730 --> 47:43.910]  Geoff is using a Mad Catz.
[47:43.930 --> 47:45.810]  Hey! It appears that worked.
[47:45.890 --> 47:47.390]  Thank you, whoever made that suggestion.
[47:48.190 --> 47:49.950]  Nah, it didn't work. I'm just fucking...
[47:51.170 --> 47:51.970]  Don't worry about it.
[47:52.650 --> 47:53.050]  Okay.
[47:53.330 --> 47:55.370]  I went handheld just to get past my turn.
[47:57.990 --> 48:00.110]  You went through all that, and you still have more money
[48:00.110 --> 48:02.010]  than I do. And you're in a one-player
[48:02.010 --> 48:03.950]  game. Oh, for God's
[48:04.630 --> 48:05.030]  sake.
[48:06.330 --> 48:07.050]  Whack-a-plant.
[48:08.030 --> 48:09.050]  I'm gonna kill myself.
[48:13.630 --> 48:14.430]  This sucks.
[48:15.110 --> 48:15.870]  Oh, Geoff's back.
[48:17.290 --> 48:19.130]  It cutting out on Discord makes it sound much better.
[48:19.330 --> 48:20.270]  It does. Oh, yeah.
[48:23.210 --> 48:24.670]  Sometimes when you yell, Gavin,
[48:24.790 --> 48:26.990]  it does that. When I yell, yeah.
[48:27.370 --> 48:27.890]  When you yell.
[48:28.950 --> 48:31.010]  Discord, I feel like maybe if you get
[48:31.010 --> 48:32.990]  Discord Nitro, it should allow the
[48:32.990 --> 48:33.610]  yells through.
[48:35.730 --> 48:37.030]  Oh. We still haven't gotten
[48:37.030 --> 48:37.950]  Nitro. Nope.
[48:40.190 --> 48:40.930]  I don't think...
[48:40.930 --> 48:42.950]  What is happening here? What is happening?
[48:43.250 --> 48:44.370]  Are you supposed to hit them?
[48:44.710 --> 48:46.230]  Are you supposed to jump on them, Geoff?
[48:46.470 --> 48:49.050]  You're supposed to land on their heads, but he's been evading them.
[48:50.350 --> 48:51.230]  They ain't fucking...
[48:51.230 --> 48:51.850]  They ain't hurting me.
[48:53.770 --> 48:54.790]  And you're not hurting them either.
[48:54.790 --> 48:56.970]  I can deal with that. I'm a pacifist.
[48:57.010 --> 48:57.430]  I don't care.
[48:59.410 --> 49:00.990]  I think you bounce on them, and they give you
[49:00.990 --> 49:02.750]  coins for each one you kill within the set.
[49:03.230 --> 49:04.970]  So I'm a killer for hire?
[49:05.250 --> 49:06.610]  You're a killer for hire.
[49:12.010 --> 49:12.690]  Well, hey,
[49:12.750 --> 49:14.490]  you got seven coins out of it.
[49:14.670 --> 49:15.390]  More than y'all got.
[49:16.110 --> 49:17.910]  That's true. That's a great point.
[49:18.870 --> 49:19.290]  Oh.
[49:20.570 --> 49:22.670]  Slow descend into the pipe.
[49:26.170 --> 49:28.350]  I can't believe you have three stars.
[49:28.490 --> 49:29.250]  I'm so mad.
[49:30.870 --> 49:31.710]  Yeah, it's real cool.
[49:32.250 --> 49:33.310]  Yeah, you gave him one.
[49:34.870 --> 49:35.590]  And by
[49:35.590 --> 49:37.410]  gave him one, I mean you gave him one of Geoff's.
[49:37.410 --> 49:39.870]  You stole my fucking star and gave it to him.
[49:40.190 --> 49:41.690]  Treasure divers, let's move on.
[49:42.490 --> 49:43.370]  We don't need to talk about how.
[49:44.150 --> 49:45.190]  I'm just mad it happened.
[49:46.670 --> 49:47.450]  A to dive.
[49:50.330 --> 49:51.090]  Move and swim.
[49:53.770 --> 49:54.890]  What do we not want to get?
[49:56.870 --> 49:57.770]  Eaten by a shark.
[49:57.770 --> 49:58.510]  Shark.
[49:59.690 --> 50:01.850]  Oh, you need to come back for air every once in a while.
[50:01.990 --> 50:02.190]  It says.
[50:02.750 --> 50:03.990]  So just avoid drowning.
[50:05.590 --> 50:07.890]  Pretty good rule of thumb in the swimming world.
[50:08.030 --> 50:09.070]  I think sharks too, maybe.
[50:10.150 --> 50:10.590]  Sharks.
[50:11.290 --> 50:11.510]  Oh!
[50:13.090 --> 50:14.070]  I'll beat up a shark.
[50:15.890 --> 50:17.150]  I'm not worried about sharks.
[50:18.170 --> 50:19.450]  Oh god! Oh god!
[50:21.250 --> 50:22.450]  That was really close, Andrew.
[50:22.790 --> 50:23.330]  It was.
[50:24.270 --> 50:25.390]  Get away from me,
[50:25.570 --> 50:25.770]  Wario.
[50:26.350 --> 50:29.010]  Why are my chest so small and shit?
[50:29.970 --> 50:31.550]  You squid fuck.
[50:33.130 --> 50:33.830]  No!
[50:34.350 --> 50:35.830]  No, Wario.
[50:40.590 --> 50:42.390]  I don't know if I did well or not.
[50:43.030 --> 50:43.810]  Was that teams?
[50:44.290 --> 50:45.810]  No, I don't think so.
[50:46.270 --> 50:46.650]  Shit.
[50:47.490 --> 50:48.850]  Just nine?
[50:49.950 --> 50:50.590]  Ten.
[50:52.730 --> 50:53.370]  Whatever.
[50:53.690 --> 50:55.570]  I'm building up a hull.
[50:57.370 --> 50:58.010]  Oh.
[51:04.240 --> 51:05.200]  Oh, Nick.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.220]  Hey, it's red like you.
[51:08.440 --> 51:08.720]  Yeah.
[51:10.480 --> 51:12.460]  Just turn 16.
[51:13.420 --> 51:15.040]  Oh, it feels like at least 26.
[51:15.700 --> 51:16.760]  Holy shit.
[51:17.640 --> 51:18.500]  How long have we been going for?
[51:18.500 --> 51:19.280]  An hour.
[51:21.820 --> 51:23.700]  So we'll be...
[51:23.700 --> 51:25.600]  Two and a half hours.
[51:26.480 --> 51:27.080]  We're doing good.
[51:27.500 --> 51:27.560]  What?
[51:30.060 --> 51:32.260]  In another hour we'll be at 32.
[51:32.580 --> 51:34.240]  Yeah, and then another hour we'll be at...
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.000]  32.
[51:35.820 --> 51:39.100]  And then that leaves 18, so we just pretend it goes faster.
[51:43.160 --> 51:43.600]  Hey!
[51:44.020 --> 51:46.740]  Well, we're not going to have technical difficulties for the rest of it,
[51:46.740 --> 51:47.540]  so that'll help too.
[51:48.480 --> 51:49.640]  The Wii is...
[51:50.500 --> 51:52.820]  I'm going to knock on this piece of wood right here.
[51:53.560 --> 51:54.820]  Give me the star!
[51:55.760 --> 51:56.100]  Yeah!
[52:00.760 --> 52:03.060]  DK looks so freaking weird in this game.
[52:03.240 --> 52:06.580]  He looks traumatized.
[52:07.040 --> 52:08.040]  PTSD DK.
[52:09.100 --> 52:10.380]  Did you ever watch that CG
[52:11.300 --> 52:12.460]  DK TV show?
[52:12.480 --> 52:14.320]  No, I've always wanted to. It looks so bad.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.900]  Oh, yeah!
[52:15.900 --> 52:17.360]  I used to like it.
[52:17.500 --> 52:20.640]  I used to like Cranky being a real miserable bastard.
[52:21.520 --> 52:22.740]  Oh, birthday boy!
[52:24.200 --> 52:25.500]  Back in action!
[52:26.500 --> 52:27.200]  Oh, go! No!
[52:27.340 --> 52:29.420]  Bombskip ball! That's right up Geoff and my alley.
[52:29.600 --> 52:30.920]  What's desert dash?
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.020]  You're going to be hot on your toes.
[52:34.820 --> 52:36.640]  Bring in the teams for a ski race in the desert.
[52:36.840 --> 52:37.500]  Push left.
[52:37.760 --> 52:39.180]  Okay, so we've got to in sync.
[52:39.520 --> 52:41.120]  Gavin, left and right.
[52:42.180 --> 52:42.880]  Alright, Nick.
[52:43.820 --> 52:45.180]  How do we call it?
[52:45.240 --> 52:46.380]  You call it, I'll listen.
[52:46.860 --> 52:49.240]  Left, right, left, right.
[52:49.840 --> 52:51.720]  Left, right, left, right.
[52:52.040 --> 52:52.640]  Which stick though?
[52:54.360 --> 52:54.700]  Right!
[52:54.820 --> 52:56.780]  Alright, left, right. Oh, I see.
[52:56.960 --> 52:57.520]  Left, right.
[52:58.840 --> 53:00.020]  Gavin, ready?
[53:00.660 --> 53:02.040]  No, we've got to do it together.
[53:03.100 --> 53:04.060]  Right, left.
[53:04.720 --> 53:05.240]  We got it.
[53:06.880 --> 53:09.220]  Right, left, right, left.
[53:09.240 --> 53:11.160]  Right, left, right, left.
[53:11.160 --> 53:13.340]  Right, left, right, left.
[53:13.720 --> 53:15.240]  Left, right, left, right.
[53:15.580 --> 53:19.080]  Left, right, left, right.
[53:19.080 --> 53:22.280]  Left, right, left, right.
[53:22.280 --> 53:23.620]  Left, right, left, right.
[53:23.720 --> 53:24.280]  Left, right, left, right.
[53:24.780 --> 53:25.500]  Left, right, left.
[53:25.500 --> 53:27.080]  Yeah! What a comeback!
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.400]  What a comeback!
[53:30.700 --> 53:31.960]  Team Birthday Boy!
[53:32.780 --> 53:35.200]  Let me be honest with you.
[53:35.540 --> 53:37.400]  For the first five or so steps,
[53:37.440 --> 53:38.400]  I was pressing the wrong stick.
[53:41.840 --> 53:44.000]  I don't have enough money!
[53:44.820 --> 53:45.060]  Alright.
[53:47.900 --> 53:48.460]  Woah.
[53:49.980 --> 53:52.040]  Team Birthday Boys on an absolute tear.
[53:52.140 --> 53:53.280]  Oh, that was beautiful.
[53:56.400 --> 53:58.140]  What happened to the other team?
[53:58.820 --> 53:59.940]  We died. We died.
[54:00.320 --> 54:01.220]  We just got bit flat.
[54:01.600 --> 54:04.180]  Oh, I helped myself.
[54:05.900 --> 54:06.980]  Oh, I fucked myself.
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.040]  No, you have to win the next minigame.
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.740]  Well, I better be a money maker.
[54:14.360 --> 54:14.940]  Ooh.
[54:15.540 --> 54:16.040]  Ooh.
[54:21.290 --> 54:22.150]  What are you thinking?
[54:23.190 --> 54:24.290]  What are you buying?
[54:30.080 --> 54:31.970]  Just a thing my old friend used to say.
[54:35.340 --> 54:35.960]  Oh, okay.
[54:41.660 --> 54:42.240]  Geoff?
[54:45.320 --> 54:45.940]  That's me.
[54:47.040 --> 54:47.940]  That is you.
[54:47.940 --> 54:50.340]  Oh, you got a mushroom.
[54:51.160 --> 54:51.720]  Oh.
[54:53.760 --> 54:54.320]  Nice.
[54:54.960 --> 54:56.380]  I've been embiggened.
[54:57.080 --> 54:57.980]  Go again.
[54:58.280 --> 54:59.100]  Emboldened, even.
[55:02.750 --> 55:03.330]  Oh, what's up?
[55:05.230 --> 55:06.510]  Oh, another four player.
[55:07.510 --> 55:08.010]  Need the money.
[55:09.530 --> 55:10.610]  Running with the bulb.
[55:11.950 --> 55:13.650]  Oh, this is not going to get me ten coins.
[55:14.650 --> 55:15.730]  Not with that attitude.
[55:16.650 --> 55:17.070]  You're right.
[55:17.070 --> 55:18.710]  Run the bulb down the socket.
[55:19.030 --> 55:20.350]  Punch the booze before they grab you.
[55:21.450 --> 55:22.390]  How do I punch?
[55:22.530 --> 55:25.110]  So just wail it on booze.
[55:25.610 --> 55:26.490]  B was hit.
[55:26.630 --> 55:28.330]  That's what I used to do in my 20s.
[55:29.770 --> 55:30.850]  Shut the fuck up.
[55:32.750 --> 55:33.770]  Oh, we're working together?
[55:33.970 --> 55:34.650]  I think so, yeah.
[55:35.950 --> 55:37.330]  You guys have to keep me safe.
[55:37.390 --> 55:38.490]  Oh, kick the shit out of him.
[55:39.690 --> 55:40.230]  Oh, shit.
[55:42.770 --> 55:43.810]  They're flanking us.
[55:43.810 --> 55:44.990]  They're on our six.
[55:45.050 --> 55:45.790]  I gotcha.
[55:45.890 --> 55:48.830]  Watch out for the womp.
[55:50.150 --> 55:51.470]  Oh, no.
[55:51.870 --> 55:52.350]  Punch him.
[55:53.470 --> 55:53.850]  Punch Mario.
[55:54.410 --> 55:55.070]  Ow.
[55:58.430 --> 55:59.750]  Punch Luigi.
[56:00.430 --> 56:02.310]  Go, go, go.
[56:02.390 --> 56:02.910]  Get Gavin.
[56:03.670 --> 56:04.650]  Get Gavin.
[56:04.990 --> 56:05.530]  Oh, no.
[56:07.850 --> 56:09.290]  Beat the shit out of him.
[56:09.290 --> 56:10.650]  I can't do anything.
[56:10.650 --> 56:11.570]  I have to pull.
[56:11.730 --> 56:12.970]  I'm trying to get here.
[56:14.030 --> 56:16.650]  We did it.
[56:17.950 --> 56:18.430]  We did it.
[56:19.270 --> 56:20.530]  Oh, my God.
[56:21.050 --> 56:22.490]  That was intense.
[56:25.390 --> 56:26.390]  Oh, man.
[56:27.030 --> 56:27.550]  Ten coins.
[56:28.810 --> 56:29.210]  Ten coins.
[56:30.350 --> 56:31.770]  I thought it broke for a second.
[56:31.890 --> 56:32.430]  It was just frozen.
[56:32.790 --> 56:34.250]  Good job, everyone.
[56:35.810 --> 56:36.610]  Great game.
[56:37.850 --> 56:39.110]  Hey, great teamwork.
[56:39.170 --> 56:39.550]  Oh, my God.
[56:39.590 --> 56:40.430]  Here we go.
[56:41.490 --> 56:42.190]  No!
[56:45.970 --> 56:46.670]  This...
[56:47.530 --> 56:49.090]  Don't you dare.
[56:49.190 --> 56:50.510]  Don't you dare
[56:50.510 --> 56:51.810]  do a Bowser revolution.
[56:57.030 --> 56:57.490]  No.
[56:59.070 --> 56:59.770]  No.
[57:06.090 --> 57:06.440]  Oh.
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.700]  Just from you as well.
[57:08.780 --> 57:10.740]  Oh, Nick.
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.980]  That very only
[57:12.980 --> 57:14.400]  specifically fucked you.
[57:15.040 --> 57:16.240]  Oh, God.
[57:16.760 --> 57:18.380]  Holy shit.
[57:20.220 --> 57:22.340]  My eyes hurt from that.
[57:23.280 --> 57:25.400]  Go left.
[57:25.920 --> 57:26.480]  Go left.
[57:30.400 --> 57:31.520]  Okay.
[57:32.340 --> 57:33.100]  Okay.
[57:35.800 --> 57:36.560]  Okay.
[57:37.740 --> 57:38.920]  Oh, God.
[57:45.510 --> 57:46.890]  Look at him wait.
[57:47.470 --> 57:48.150]  He's waiting.
[57:49.010 --> 57:49.710]  He's learning.
[57:50.750 --> 57:55.190]  Oh, there's one that's like a full-on swap.
[57:56.030 --> 57:56.270]  Yeah.
[57:57.290 --> 57:58.050]  Fuck.
[57:59.250 --> 58:00.010]  No!
[58:00.750 --> 58:01.610]  Piece of shit.
[58:01.610 --> 58:02.030]  Yeah!
[58:03.150 --> 58:03.870]  God damn it.
[58:04.730 --> 58:06.010]  I'm still in it.
[58:06.670 --> 58:07.510]  Thank you, man.
[58:07.970 --> 58:11.230]  I could still make it if I win this next mini-game.
[58:12.010 --> 58:12.450]  Oh, shit.
[58:17.190 --> 58:18.230]  Oh, God.
[58:20.850 --> 58:22.130]  Is this turn 17?
[58:24.790 --> 58:27.090]  Oh, it's team birthday boy again.
[58:27.530 --> 58:27.750]  Alright, Geoff.
[58:27.750 --> 58:28.650]  Here we go.
[58:28.810 --> 58:31.670]  I don't need you to be all defeated like this, okay?
[58:31.930 --> 58:33.090]  No, no, no, no.
[58:33.110 --> 58:34.510]  We're gonna kick some dick.
[58:34.630 --> 58:36.090]  We're not, but it's okay.
[58:36.850 --> 58:37.850]  What, what, what?
[58:39.190 --> 58:39.590]  Race.
[58:39.990 --> 58:43.010]  The more the two of you press A, the faster you will go.
[58:43.250 --> 58:44.750]  Alright, I'm just gonna be slamming it.
[58:45.390 --> 58:45.550]  Wait.
[58:46.830 --> 58:47.670]  What's the controls?
[58:47.690 --> 58:52.470]  If you move left to right against the lean, you can go around corners without losing speed.
[58:53.830 --> 58:54.830]  Team dick kickers.
[58:54.830 --> 58:56.270]  There's a B button. What does the B do?
[58:57.070 --> 58:57.410]  Break.
[58:58.650 --> 58:59.710]  There's a break? Uh oh.
[59:00.470 --> 59:01.630]  The more the two of you press...
[59:01.630 --> 59:04.450]  Oh, so is it just absolute button bash salad?
[59:04.570 --> 59:06.330]  Watch this button bash. Go, go, go, go, go.
[59:06.830 --> 59:08.490]  Remember, lean against the turn, Nick.
[59:09.150 --> 59:11.250]  Remember, lean into the lava on the turn.
[59:12.830 --> 59:16.010]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[59:16.170 --> 59:16.490]  Birthday boy.
[59:18.810 --> 59:19.490]  What happened?
[59:20.730 --> 59:21.890]  I don't know.
[59:21.890 --> 59:23.930]  We're dead. We lost.
[59:24.150 --> 59:24.810]  It's just over?
[59:25.510 --> 59:26.430]  It's just over.
[59:26.690 --> 59:29.290]  I don't know how we...
[59:29.290 --> 59:30.650]  I was going against the thing.
[59:33.790 --> 59:35.950]  Just keep it on the tracks. Don't die.
[59:36.110 --> 59:36.890]  You can't die like this.
[59:37.830 --> 59:39.110]  Just hold.
[59:39.730 --> 59:40.690]  Please die.
[59:42.210 --> 59:42.850]  Yeah!
[59:43.790 --> 59:44.690]  Birthday boy!
[59:48.270 --> 59:49.910]  Team birthday boy.
[59:49.910 --> 59:50.790]  Fucking funny.
[59:50.890 --> 59:52.830]  We broke the record of five minutes.
[59:57.530 --> 59:58.730]  Minus ten?!
[59:58.730 --> 59:59.510]  Oh!
[01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:01.990]  Oh!
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:21.100]  Hey, there you go.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.500]  Oh, fuck!
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.900]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.920]  Oh, Christ.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.120]  Oh, that was good.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.040]  Oh, that's funny.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.200]  Goddamn.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.500]  Someone in the chat said at least I got to
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.940]  screw over whoever goes next.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.060]  And that was undone instantly by whoever
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.520]  landed on the edges.
[01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:54.470]  You want to get there first?
[01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:55.050]  Okay.
[01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:58.010]  Okay.
[01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.670]  That was interesting.
[01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.350]  What's this team?
[01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.030]  I didn't have enough points
[01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:06.810]  and I was worried that I would just get there and not be able to...
[01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:08.790]  I see. Okay. Totally fair.
[01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:10.910]  What's our team name, Nick?
[01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.730]  Uh...
[01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:16.870]  Team Blow McBomb.
[01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.050]  Team what?
[01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:20.050]  What?
[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:22.350]  Bomb McBlow? No.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.210]  Okay.
[01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.510]  Uh, Bomb Boyz. Bomb Boyz.
[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.590]  How about Bomb Boyz?
[01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:30.110]  Yeah, come on, Bomb Boyz over there.
[01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:31.610]  Wait.
[01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:34.550]  Am I playing defense?
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:36.530]  I don't know.
[01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:37.870]  I'm taking it fucking right to the hoop.
[01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.470]  What the...
[01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.290]  Oh, bullshit.
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.550]  Yeah! What?
[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.350]  That's how you do it!
[01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.070]  You can't beat Donkey Kong in a game of basketball!
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.530]  What?!
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.130]  You just fucking posterized us and that's the end of the game?
[01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.770]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.790]  First team to score.
[01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:56.070]  That's what I'm talking about, Geoff.
[01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:57.890]  Playground rules. That's how we do it.
[01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:59.650]  I don't have any money.
[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:02.430]  Nick, you cursed me with your loss of coins.
[01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:03.490]  I...
[01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:05.270]  Oh, Nick.
[01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:06.630]  Oh.
[01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.810]  Just gonna...
[01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.990]  I'll just hit the button when it's my turn.
[01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:14.110]  And...
[01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.530]  Oh, I should've looked at the thing.
[01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:16.970]  Oh.
[01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:18.110]  Oh.
[01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.470]  Come on!
[01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:24.770]  What is this game?
[01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:26.390]  Why?
[01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.290]  Oh, man.
[01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.890]  Oh, you're so boned.
[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.130]  It really likes the green game.
[01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:37.030]  Oh, I got the green game.
[01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.210]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:42.890]  Ah.
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:49.510]  Hey.
[01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.430]  Hey.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:58.960]  All right.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.520]  We just have to work together to win.
[01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:08.750]  You haven't had much luck recently.
[01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:12.490]  Don't test the theory of my man.
[01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:13.290]  Just keep going.
[01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:16.990]  See what you can do with Wario or something.
[01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:17.790]  Oh!
[01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:19.590]  Wiggle! Wiggle!
[01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:20.330]  No!
[01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:24.630]  Shit!
[01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:26.430]  Fuck!
[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:28.710]  Are you shitting me?
[01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:29.690]  Why don't we get coins?
[01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:30.370]  Yeah!
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:32.450]  Nobody gets anything.
[01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.070]  I win one and I get nothing?
[01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:37.070]  Awesome.
[01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.990]  So you can't even count on winning a minigame sometimes.
[01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:41.670]  That's insanity.
[01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:45.130]  Shit.
[01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:46.230]  Ah.
[01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:48.890]  Are you...
[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:52.230]  kicking my dick in right now?
[01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.910]  Yeah, this game fucking loves Gavin.
[01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:55.770]  What is this?
[01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:57.410]  God damn.
[01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.130]  No.
[01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.430]  Why?
[01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:03.170]  Why even?
[01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:05.390]  You need to land on one of those squares
[01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.470]  and do a star swap with Gavin.
[01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:08.930]  Yup.
[01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.210]  Nah.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.020]  Oh.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.920]  No, Geoff.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.460]  I know, I know, I know.
[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.070]  We're not even at 20 turns, are we?
[01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.350]  I think we are.
[01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:25.810]  We're probably at like 22.
[01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:26.950]  What?
[01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.350]  Fuck off!
[01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.430]  You gotta be
[01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:33.930]  fucking kidding me.
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:35.230]  21.
[01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:37.550]  Happy birthday.
[01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.630]  Thanks.
[01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:42.350]  I'm moving
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:44.470]  fucking one at a time.
[01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:45.410]  One, two, one, two.
[01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.050]  About to get personal in here.
[01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.390]  You know what you have to do.
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.610]  Give me one of those fucking stars.
[01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.570]  Ooh.
[01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:53.710]  Hell yes.
[01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:55.790]  That's unfortunate.
[01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.870]  Wow. Dang.
[01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:00.230]  I worked hard for my stars.
[01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:01.830]  Hmm.
[01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.510]  Once again, DK looks alarmed
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.570]  by everything that's happening.
[01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:07.430]  How much did that cost you? 40?
[01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:08.370]  50.
[01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.830]  Hmm.
[01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.190]  10 more than a fake Bowser one.
[01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:15.630]  Knock block tower.
[01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:16.390]  Tower.
[01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:19.470]  Is that like
[01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:20.050]  tricky towers?
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.530]  Stacking of wood blocks comes crashing down.
[01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:25.670]  Break the boxes to get to the treasure chest on top.
[01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:26.070]  Jump.
[01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:29.190]  Okay. So we just smash the wood?
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:30.590]  Just break the wood.
[01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:32.270]  Just he does.
[01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:34.430]  I'll watch.
[01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.250]  Good luck, little DK.
[01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:43.110]  Fuck!
[01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.750]  No, I lost coins.
[01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:01.010]  How did that happen?
[01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.310]  Oh, boy.
[01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:05.650]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:08.030]  I love it. Thank you.
[01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.390]  I'll bet you do.
[01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:11.070]  I'll take that.
[01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.330]  Oh, fucking hell.
[01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.730]  I can't believe that.
[01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.970]  Shy Guy says...
[01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:20.010]  We know what's going on this time.
[01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:21.910]  This is going to be a more competitive game.
[01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:23.590]  Don't have to read it.
[01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.190]  A is white.
[01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:27.210]  B is red.
[01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:38.650]  Can't get me this time.
[01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.070]  Uh-uh.
[01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:48.090]  Whoa.
[01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:48.730]  Oh, God.
[01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:53.980]  Oh, I almost hit B.
[01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:58.930]  It got so intense in here.
[01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:01.010]  I'm pissed off.
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:08.750]  Damn it.
[01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:14.450]  What? That's bullshit.
[01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:19.990]  I'll cut you in, little five of those coins shy guy.
[01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:20.750]  You know what's going on.
[01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.550]  We worked out a deal beforehand.
[01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:24.290]  Five for him, five for me.
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:25.490]  None.
[01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:27.730]  Pay him in the back.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.040]  So, we're almost done then, huh?
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.500]  This is insane.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.920]  It's such a short course, too.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.000]  Oh, no.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.040]  I can't do anything other than...
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.360]  What the...
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.640]  Has anyone asked Boo to do anything else?
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.260]  Take all his money.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.840]  Nick, take all his money.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.980]  I will, if Boo had, you know, bigger pockets.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.020]  That was like freaking 27 coins.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.240]  Yeah, not enough.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.340]  But not good enough.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.940]  It could have been more.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:08.640]  But no cigar.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.580]  Okay, there we go.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.240]  Just a little bit of movement.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:18.700]  Here comes Jack.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.200]  Here we go.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:20.860]  Thank you.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.400]  Wow, back in the saddle.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.840]  Back in the star saddle.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.200]  Here we go.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.160]  I would like to purchase one.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.100]  Yes, thank you.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.660]  What's it like?
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:36.380]  It feels half as good as it should right now.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.780]  As one of my stars is out there in the wild.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.940]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Geoff.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.060]  But I'll take it.
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.720]  I'd be interested to know in chat
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.600]  if anyone has turned in their regulation listener status
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.240]  and become a comment leaver
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.200]  to wish Andrew a happy birthday.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.140]  That's a good question.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.540]  That's a great way to do it.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.180]  Can we create clemency
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.540]  to comment leavers?
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.460]  Someone said no.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.960]  Sounds like you've converted a lot of people today, Andrew.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:10.720]  Oh, that's great.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.660]  Congratulations, your conversion rate's through the roof.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.880]  Just by being a day older than you were yesterday.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:16.640]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.400]  Do it again tomorrow.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:26.640]  No, not me.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:28.440]  Stupid.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.840]  Hey, Nick, you know what's up.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.920]  Oh, there you go.
[01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:40.130]  That's the fucking classic rivals.
[01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:40.950]  At it again.
[01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:43.110]  A fight as old as time.
[01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:45.650]  Like God and Satan.
[01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.470]  I can't allow you to leave this platform.
[01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.110]  I need the money.
[01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:53.610]  Oh, balls.
[01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:55.110]  No!
[01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.810]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:59.310]  He just binned it.
[01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:01.430]  Network latency.
[01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:06.910]  I wonder what's the bigger gap.
[01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.330]  The original Donkey Kong to this game
[01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.410]  or this game to now.
[01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.090]  Oh, it's probably this game to now.
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:14.170]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:27.280]  Once again, just...
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:27.960]  Hey, give me your money.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.040]  Oh, Nick.
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.340]  That sucks.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.370]  Is it because I'm Mario?
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.520]  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.040]  They should make a Wario party
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.400]  that's just a piece of shit.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.100]  Isn't that WarioWare? Sort of?
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.500]  It's not a four-player game, though, is it?
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.520]  Fuck this thing.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.500]  Oh, shit.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:05.980]  Well, damn.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.420]  What are we doing here?
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.220]  Randomly click pipe.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:11.840]  I'm going to memorize.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.220]  Third from the left.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.720]  P-Dog Biscuit breaking his comment
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.720]  regulation listener status.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.580]  Congratulations.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.960]  Oh, that's really far away
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.880]  from me. I don't like this at all.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.640]  Come back over.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.460]  No, shit.
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:29.640]  No!
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.320]  Put it in my mouth.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.020]  Those are my coins.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.660]  It's a little preview of the smut that's coming
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.200]  in the future.
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.740]  Very excited. It's ready to go.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.520]  It is done.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.460]  Gavin and I shipped
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.700]  it off to the editor, and they
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.300]  stamped their approval.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:53.580]  Hey, that's...
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.500]  Oh, so you can play a game. You can redeem yourself.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.660]  Oh, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.520]  See, this is the shit that
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.020]  makes the game a lot longer.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.080]  It is.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.960]  You get a shell game.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.560]  Find the Koopa. Oh, shit.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.320]  Alright.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:16.020]  Let's see what you want.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.400]  Oh, God.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:24.460]  Well...
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.780]  Oh, it's that one. It's that one.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.500]  I think I still have it. I have it, too,
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.180]  still, I think.
[01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:37.190]  Let's see.
[01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:39.870]  It's the one at the bottom.
[01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:41.190]  I agree.
[01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:41.270]  I agree.
[01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:43.890]  I'll trust you.
[01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.590]  Yay! Thank you!
[01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.090]  You need to help Nick a little bit.
[01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.270]  Yeah. Do we?
[01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:52.810]  You're just getting coins
[01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:54.510]  so that you can steal them from him later.
[01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:57.150]  Yeah. You're gonna take his wealth anyway.
[01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:58.270]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.890 --> 01:12:59.870]  I've seen how you work.
[01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:05.490]  For God's sake.
[01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:08.590]  Low.
[01:13:09.130 --> 01:13:10.710]  Now I'm getting high when I want it low.
[01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:11.290]  Great.
[01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:13.670]  Andrew, please be responsible.
[01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.390]  Think of your family.
[01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:18.270]  You've got so much to live for.
[01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:19.590]  Put it down.
[01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:29.510]  I need a green so bad.
[01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.470]  Poor player game.
[01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:33.390]  Mushroom.
[01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.610]  Crazy cutter again.
[01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:37.750]  I'm not losing this time.
[01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:39.930]  I'm not having a repeat of what happened before.
[01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:44.670]  Let's do it.
[01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:47.790]  Oh, this is a tough one.
[01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.490]  Wow.
[01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:52.010]  You ever notice how much
[01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.030]  a Goomba looks like something?
[01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:56.070]  Mushroom?
[01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:57.310]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:59.270]  I just gave mine a dick.
[01:14:00.650 --> 01:14:02.030]  I got a little bit tangled up
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.930]  in the penis.
[01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:05.310]  I fucking suck.
[01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.690]  Wow, I wish you could see anywhere
[01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:08.910]  around this thing.
[01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:12.090]  Oh, what am I doing? I've given him a lump.
[01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:13.510]  Right out of the toilet.
[01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:16.110]  It's the worst.
[01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.630]  I fucked it.
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.470]  96! Yeah!
[01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.330]  That was a great Goomba.
[01:14:22.350 --> 01:14:24.330]  Nobody loses this time?
[01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.990]  We all just win this time?
[01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:28.230]  Oh, what a load of
[01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.190]  horseshit.
[01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.370]  Wait, why did Luigi fall down?
[01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:33.310]  Maybe he's dead.
[01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:34.870]  That was his celebration.
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:38.190]  I was exhausted.
[01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.030]  A lot of work.
[01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:43.770]  Here we go!
[01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:45.010]  Damn it!
[01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:48.090]  Ah, Andrew, I need you
[01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:48.870]  to go through.
[01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:51.010]  It doesn't matter, you go straight.
[01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.930]  Ooh. Uh-oh.
[01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.450]  Oh, I know it's... hey.
[01:14:57.630 --> 01:14:58.530]  Oh no.
[01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:00.630]  Oh no!
[01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:03.930]  Ah, I got some spare
[01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:05.330]  bunts. Let's see.
[01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:07.990]  You don't need it.
[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.110]  You don't... hey, you got plenty
[01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:12.190]  of them. You don't...
[01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:15.910]  Excuse me?
[01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:17.510]  Why would you take my star?
[01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.070]  I only have one. He's got two.
[01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:21.690]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:23.430]  Alright, well, I'll leave it to chat.
[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:25.410]  What? What?
[01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:27.090]  What a monster.
[01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:29.670]  Chat said, please don't steal from Geoff. Thank you,
[01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:31.690]  Fire Trooper. Please don't
[01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:32.630]  steal from Geoff.
[01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:34.770]  DK, DK, DK,
[01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:37.430]  DK, DK, DK, so many
[01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:39.310]  DK. I feel like maybe
[01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.290]  having it put in chat instead of an official
[01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:42.230]  poll was the wrong move.
[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.890]  Close your eyes. Close your eyes and just
[01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:46.470]  shut the fuck up.
[01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:49.070]  You're not helping.
[01:15:49.690 --> 01:15:50.770]  I did see a lot of DK.
[01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:53.390]  Just shut the fuck up.
[01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:55.270]  To be fair, that's my
[01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:56.270]  frickin' star anyway.
[01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:59.310]  Technically, it was Geoff's star, but...
[01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.950]  Alright, happy birthday.
[01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:06.290]  No!
[01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:08.610]  Birthday lumps.
[01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:09.330]  Yes!
[01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.890]  Oh no!
[01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:14.150]  Oh, it's poppin' off. Come on, come on.
[01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.130]  Daddy needs a star.
[01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.970]  He really wants the star swap.
[01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:31.230]  But missing the star swap
[01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:33.070]  I think means ten coins.
[01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.350]  He did not miss.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.910]  Well, it's just a one-er.
[01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:42.630]  No!
[01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.550]  No!
[01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:47.270]  No!
[01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:49.810]  He could only give his star
[01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:50.390]  to someone.
[01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:52.370]  He gave it to Nick!
[01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:55.030]  No, to me. Oh, to Geoff. Shit.
[01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:57.010]  Thanks for getting my hopes up.
[01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:58.970]  I looked away for a second like I didn't see it.
[01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:05.810]  I really appreciate that.
[01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:06.190]  Thank you.
[01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:09.730]  That means a lot to me,
[01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:09.910]  Andrew.
[01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:11.870]  I really does, man.
[01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.650]  In the last two minutes,
[01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:16.890]  he lost his shit.
[01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:20.290]  He's down two stars.
[01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.270]  I lost two stars.
[01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.710]  Everyone turned from riches to rags.
[01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:27.410]  Real sweet gesture.
[01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:29.850]  I'm sorry for getting your hopes up.
[01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:31.110]  It was your star, once again.
[01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.830]  Oh, it's okay.
[01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:35.530]  If I had to give it to anyone, I guess I'm glad it's you,
[01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:36.510]  but that still hurts.
[01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:39.290]  Oh, boy.
[01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:41.050]  That was my face
[01:17:41.050 --> 01:17:41.930]  when I gave it away.
[01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:19.790]  Are you...
[01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:23.350]  Fucked myself on the mouth.
[01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:27.110]  That's unfortunate.
[01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:28.590]  I've seen videos of that.
[01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:33.490]  I only turned 30 once.
[01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.770]  Oh, somebody said I had it basically perfect.
[01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:36.710]  I guess not, though.
[01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:40.750]  Oh, I'm sorry. I need the money.
[01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:43.810]  Sorry to make this longer.
[01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:48.730]  I need a green.
[01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:54.230]  Okay, this is match game.
[01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:57.630]  Best of luck, Nick.
[01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.830]  Thanks, man.
[01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:01.370]  Don't fuck yourself in the mouth.
[01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:05.010]  What the hell's pound?
[01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:06.570]  Probably B.
[01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:07.410]  Okay, I found it.
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:09.810]  It's a...
[01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:10.990]  Wow, okay.
[01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.990]  Yeah, good start.
[01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:15.450]  Let's see what this is.
[01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:17.530]  Ah, Bowser, you prick.
[01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:19.090]  Alright.
[01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:22.170]  Oh, that's top left.
[01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:25.870]  Okay, yeah, you might be right.
[01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:27.530]  Green.
[01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:29.210]  Big hit there.
[01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.190]  There's a lot of time on this clock.
[01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.790]  Ah, that was bottom left.
[01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.030]  I'm an idiot!
[01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:37.690]  What am I doing?
[01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:41.430]  I hope she went for the one that you know again
[01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:42.530]  instead of finding...
[01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:47.290]  3, 2, 1!
[01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.730]  Get up, you lazy bum!
[01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:56.650]  6!
[01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.070]  6!
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.220]  All of that time for 6 coins.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.760]  Oh, no.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:13.000]  1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:13.920]  Yeah!
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.180]  Do you really want that?
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.040]  Now you're gonna...
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.000]  Bowser revolution.
[01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:27.930]  Oh!
[01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:30.110]  Bowser's facelift.
[01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:31.150]  Oh, no.
[01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:33.150]  Everyone plays the minigame.
[01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:34.490]  Not everyone!
[01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:38.030]  If you don't get at least 90, you lose 30 coins.
[01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.850]  Oh, no!
[01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:42.310]  I'll kill you! No! It's my lifeline!
[01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.430]  It's what I have!
[01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:45.210]  Okay.
[01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:48.570]  Oh, I gotta lock into this face.
[01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:51.550]  Oh, that's good.
[01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:52.410]  That's a good face.
[01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.770]  Whoa, shit!
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:01.920]  Oops!
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:25.700]  Ah, shit!
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.260]  I definitely didn't get it.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:27.820]  No!
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.180]  Oh, we all suck!
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.280]  My money!
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.740]  We just lost 120 coins from the economy.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.220]  I have 8 again.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.240]  For the love of God,
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.220]  please, somebody flip that header,
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.900]  or else I'm about to lose 70 coins.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:50.440]  I can't even afford
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.640]  to steal a star anymore.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.420]  Flip that head!
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:56.880]  Flip!
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:57.360]  Oh!
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:21:59.980]  Oh, no!
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.500]  Oh, no!
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:04.000]  What is this?
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.020]  Piranha's Pursuit.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.140]  Is this the coin one?
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:09.880]  No?
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.020]  No, press B repeatedly
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.040]  to escape the Piranha Plant.
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.000]  Okay.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:18.180]  Hip drop to feed the Piranha Plant with rain.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:18.460]  Okay.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.580]  Seems easy enough.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.400]  I got that MVP advantage.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.200]  I'm ready to win another one on a skateboard.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.920]  I gotta kill that monkey.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:29.800]  I came third?
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:31.120]  Shit!
[01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:35.710]  Left trigger is Z.
[01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:44.950]  This is in the new one as well.
[01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:46.550]  This must be just directly from the
[01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:48.230]  old game.
[01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:50.110]  It's impossible to win as the Piranha.
[01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:51.170]  Good.
[01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:54.490]  What?!
[01:22:54.490 --> 01:22:55.630]  Ah, he's shit!
[01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:57.410]  Get him!
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:59.530]  Are you fucking kidding me?!
[01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.790]  I've never seen that happen!
[01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.530]  Network latency!
[01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:13.050]  Five?!
[01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:13.990]  I'm gonna lose coins.
[01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:15.830]  Not yet!
[01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:17.150]  Please!
[01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:19.070]  Oh, balls!
[01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:21.170]  Oh, wait!
[01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:22.430]  Oh no!
[01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.350]  There are so many chances for this to happen.
[01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:27.510]  It's such a commonly hit.
[01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:30.170]  In the newer ones,
[01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:31.590]  it's so rare that this happens.
[01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:33.090]  We've had it like eight times.
[01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:36.730]  Oh no!
[01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:40.730]  Yes!
[01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.990]  Yes!
[01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.850]  Yes!
[01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:48.030]  This is bullshit!
[01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.450]  Straight in my pocket!
[01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:52.470]  God damn it!
[01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:53.990]  Oh my god!
[01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:56.730]  I cannot believe...
[01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:58.110]  I didn't want it!
[01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:59.150]  I didn't want it!
[01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:01.750]  How much is he paying you, Nick?
[01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:09.370]  He can't keep getting away with it.
[01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:12.530]  Oh no!
[01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:14.650]  Three turns ago,
[01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:17.170]  I had two stars and 90 coins!
[01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:21.170]  I've got four coins!
[01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:26.410]  You'll have ten more after that.
[01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:34.190]  DK's like,
[01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:35.050]  did I do well?
[01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:37.050]  Do we want this?
[01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:39.410]  Hell yeah!
[01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:41.250]  Said Gavin,
[01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:42.950]  it's really just Michael and a mask.
[01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:44.430]  It's crazy!
[01:24:44.730 --> 01:24:47.250]  It's like I've been absorbing some of Michael's soul.
[01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:50.870]  You should probably get that looked at.
[01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.370]  When was the last time
[01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:54.290]  you got a tetanus shot?
[01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:55.790]  Oh, good point.
[01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:58.570]  Oh my god!
[01:24:59.750 --> 01:25:00.310]  Wow!
[01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.130]  That couldn't have happened a turn ago?
[01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:06.210]  How are you
[01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:08.390]  kidding me?
[01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.410]  I'm so
[01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:11.990]  fucked!
[01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:14.990]  I just don't
[01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:16.010]  even know
[01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:18.030]  what I'm gonna do!
[01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:19.450]  I hate this so much!
[01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.270]  What am I gonna do?
[01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:23.530]  I'm just gonna...
[01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:27.070]  Anything I win
[01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.730]  is gone!
[01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:31.090]  I've given up three stars
[01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:31.630]  now, I think.
[01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:36.250]  What arrow is it?
[01:25:37.210 --> 01:25:38.850]  You gotta find it, dumbass.
[01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.950]  No!
[01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.510]  Yes!
[01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:43.350]  Fuck, okay.
[01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:45.870]  Wasn't this supposed to be an arrow?
[01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:48.530]  Arrows point the direction of where it goes.
[01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.690]  What arrow?
[01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:51.430]  You just didn't find it!
[01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:54.490]  He's gonna lose all that in a turn anyway.
[01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.050]  It's all good.
[01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:58.410]  Either I go there, or I go there.
[01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:00.570]  Either way, Bowser's gonna ram me in the can.
[01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:02.530]  Here comes the can rammer!
[01:26:02.530 --> 01:26:03.950]  Yeah, here we go!
[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:06.930]  It's a real ram can.
[01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:08.290]  Go ahead and unbuckle.
[01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:10.650]  Hold on.
[01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:12.470]  Do you remember when we played
[01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:14.270]  Sloppy Joe's Bingo the other day? Wasn't that so much fun?
[01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:15.590]  Oh, what? It was great.
[01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:17.170]  When's that VOD out?
[01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:19.530]  It comes out Thursday.
[01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.870]  For the public, or for Patreon?
[01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:23.330]  For everybody.
[01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:25.450]  And that'll be on our YouTube channel.
[01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:27.770]  Yeah, it was a good one.
[01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:29.370]  It was really good.
[01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:30.910]  It was the one where we had
[01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:33.330]  we did the live draft where we
[01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:34.330]  drafted our bingo
[01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:36.250]  boards.
[01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:38.970]  And we took suggestions from the Falcons.
[01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:41.370]  I'm really sad I didn't get
[01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:43.310]  Dog and a Hog, but...
[01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.930]  Yeah, me too.
[01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:45.710]  It came close a bunch.
[01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:47.570]  Hell yeah.
[01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:50.950]  You get there just in time again.
[01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:52.670]  We just hit 20,000 followers.
[01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:54.750]  Holy shit, that's awesome.
[01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.410]  Thanks for spreading the word.
[01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.970]  Yeah.
[01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:01.310]  Spread the word. Spread it like a virus.
[01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.750]  Infect everyone.
[01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.970]  Good luck, Geoff.
[01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:06.790]  Thank you.
[01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.870]  Yeah.
[01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:11.030]  I can't believe how many
[01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:13.450]  people have been consistently
[01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:14.030]  watching this.
[01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:16.970]  This is quite a commitment of the
[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:18.910]  whole day.
[01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:20.950]  It's a commitment for us alone.
[01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.050]  How many people in chat has it passed midnight for?
[01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:24.030]  Oh, goodness.
[01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:25.610]  Oh, dear.
[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:35.070]  Revealing the picture.
[01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:38.690]  Trying to uncover the picture.
[01:27:39.750 --> 01:27:40.050]  Okay.
[01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:42.890]  Oh, it's tomorrow for some people.
[01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:43.970]  Tomorrow morning.
[01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:46.610]  Oh, I see.
[01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.810]  Shit.
[01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:54.630]  Shit, shit, shit,
[01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:55.150]  shit, shit.
[01:27:57.370 --> 01:27:58.010]  Come on.
[01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:58.390]  Come on.
[01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:00.930]  Oh, come on now.
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.050]  Come on, you silly sack.
[01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:04.190]  Yes!
[01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:08.230]  No! I had it!
[01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:13.830]  Oh, I needed it.
[01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:18.050]  What else is coming out this week? Our Spider-Heck stream
[01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:20.030]  from Friday, which turned out to be a lot of fun.
[01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.950]  No!
[01:28:22.810 --> 01:28:23.290]  Nick!
[01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.490]  I didn't want it!
[01:28:25.490 --> 01:28:27.130]  It's true! I didn't want it!
[01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:28.010]  I know it's not your fault.
[01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.570]  I know!
[01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:32.190]  Are you
[01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:34.510]  channeling Robin Williams?
[01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:36.350]  It's not your fault.
[01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.630]  It's not.
[01:28:38.770 --> 01:28:41.530]  You gotta get that star.
[01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:43.670]  You gotta get it.
[01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.870]  Gotta get it.
[01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:46.730]  Fuck.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.360]  Alright, here we go.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:51.780]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:52.660]  Yes!
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.880]  Oh, yeah!
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:55.940]  Don't.
[01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.900]  I'll go ahead and park this.
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.120]  Go ahead and park this so that Gavin
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.020]  can take it later.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.220]  Oddly enough, it's gonna be one of the
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.980]  other two that gives it to him, but
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:11.320]  okay, here we go. What do we have coming out on
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.300]  Saturday this week?
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.500]  I can tell you. We have
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.260]  regulation gameplay. Oh, EA Football.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.760]  I think it's coming out.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.400]  England versus...
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.200]  Yeah, does it come home?
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.380]  We had some
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.840]  England versus Canadian action.
[01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:28.200]  And then Sunday...
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:29.800]  A few times.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.420]  Sunday, we have
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.340]  a demo disc...
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.120]  What is it called? Demolition?
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.540]  We change the name of it every episode.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.300]  I don't know. I think the first one was called
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.000]  Demolish Me.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:44.680]  That comes out. That's free as well
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.460]  for everybody, but you gotta watch it on the
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.040]  Patreon because of...
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.560]  Some rights.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.060]  Some copyright.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.460]  There's a lot of shit coming out this week.
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.620]  Yeah, we really do. And we're also making a lot
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:58.500]  of shit this week. It's true.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.380]  You can't outmuscle a monkey!
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:03.340]  You can't take the aim!
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:04.400]  It's so hard!
[01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.140]  Wow.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.740]  Let me go over.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.160]  I'm opening my mouth.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:17.320]  Tumbleweeds.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:21.380]  Tumbleweeds.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:24.100]  Yucky.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:29.580]  I would love a version of this game where you
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:30.920]  just rename all the minigames.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.560]  Definitely be
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.260]  Tumbleweeds.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.620]  Yes. No. No. No.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.800]  No. No. Yes.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.360]  Someone help me out.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:43.440]  Okay.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.240]  Nice job, Andrew.
[01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:49.450]  Ooh.
[01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:50.330]  Ooh.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:56.200]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.300]  One, two, three,
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.960]  four, five, six. That's the number.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.300]  I'll take that guy.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.500]  Wow, you wasted no time.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.000]  Oh!
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:06.620]  Big tens!
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.820]  Go left, go left, go left, go left!
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.660]  Boo! You gotta go to Boo!
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.320]  You gotta steal from Gavin!
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:14.200]  He can't afford Boo.
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.480]  Everybody can afford Boo.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.480]  Well, I mean, not for the star.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:22.240]  No, but he can steal your money.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.020]  Yeah, and you're gonna lose 40 coins.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:26.980]  You bankrupt him.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.400]  Do a limbo dance under all the limbo sticks.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.220]  Lean back and jump forward by pressing A.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:33.800]  Lean back.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.460]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:40.440]  A?
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.660]  Oh, I like the setting.
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:47.000]  Kinda cool.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.320]  Yeah.
[01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:55.650]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:31:55.890 --> 01:31:56.270]  Wow!
[01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:57.650]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:31:57.670 --> 01:31:58.830]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:01.450]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:05.890]  We are nailing these single players.
[01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:07.670]  You lost five coins!
[01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:09.630]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:10.610]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:12.930]  You lost it!
[01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:15.470]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:17.230]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:22.030]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:25.230]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:29.900]  Okay.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.200]  When my brother was little, he called him Louie G.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.100]  Louie G?
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.880]  Louie G.
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.640]  What are we doing?
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.580]  Break the blocks, get the money.
[01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:47.920]  Missed that.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.740]  Oh, where did I go?
[01:32:58.630 --> 01:32:59.090]  What?
[01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:03.550]  What happened to me?
[01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:05.850]  Oh, a bag of money! Where'd it go?
[01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.570]  Where'd that bag go? There!
[01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:09.430]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:10.310]  I didn't get shit!
[01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:14.010]  I didn't get a damn thing.
[01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:15.250]  Oh no!
[01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:17.790]  Twenty-two!
[01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:21.410]  God damn it!
[01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:23.150]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:24.490]  DK can afford boo!
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:26.530]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:28.650]  I would like to move!
[01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:31.670]  Come on, Gavin! Bad roll, bad roll, bad roll!
[01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:34.370]  Need to roll a one!
[01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.590]  Yes!
[01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.010]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:40.950]  Take a star, take a star, take a star,
[01:33:41.010 --> 01:33:42.670]  take a star, take a star,
[01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:42.970]  take a star, take a star, take a star!
[01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:43.810]  Nice to meet you.
[01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:47.270]  Oh, you're gonna get that star?
[01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:49.110]  That'll cost you two stars.
[01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:50.810]  Oh, that costs you two stars but you get one.
[01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:52.570]  You should do it.
[01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:54.670]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:57.430]  Not a fan of this.
[01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:58.930]  More stars than coins.
[01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:02.870]  That is insane.
[01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.830]  Yeah, I would be a fan of that.
[01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:07.490]  We're on Turn 31! Jesus Christ.
[01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:14.270]  We're almost done. We're gonna start doing moves against Gavin.
[01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:18.050]  Nah, what do you mean? You've already been doing it every time you get to boo.
[01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:23.330]  Ah, shit. I think my luck has turned in the back half of this game.
[01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:24.790]  Fuck. Welcome to my world.
[01:34:28.770 --> 01:34:29.210]  Boink.
[01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:37.650]  Oh, there's a single player game.
[01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:40.770]  Oh, here we go again. I'll take it.
[01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:45.970]  Ooh, pedal power. Let's see how quickly I fail this.
[01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:51.590]  Look at the audio on this stream.
[01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:53.130]  It's so bad.
[01:34:57.210 --> 01:34:58.370]  My audio's bad?
[01:34:59.030 --> 01:35:04.150]  No, just the sync of the game online makes it all warped and slow down.
[01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:13.990]  Just like riding your bike, Geoff.
[01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:17.770]  That's what I'm doing. I didn't ride my bike today. I didn't ride my bike yesterday either.
[01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:18.950]  Why are you not pedaling?
[01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:21.910]  You gotta pedal a lot faster than that, Geoff.
[01:35:24.210 --> 01:35:25.570]  Hey, he just started playing.
[01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:28.190]  Okay, okay. Pedal that bike!
[01:35:28.770 --> 01:35:30.590]  Okay, okay, okay.
[01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:31.690]  What was that?
[01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:36.310]  Geoff is used to the automated bike. He's used to having that battery.
[01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:41.030]  I was going left and right, I thought, but then that didn't work, so I started going in a circular motion.
[01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:44.690]  One of those left and right wheels.
[01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:47.970]  Shit.
[01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:50.870]  God bless America, this fucking game.
[01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:54.510]  I'm calling you out right now. Bring it on. Come scoop me.
[01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:56.350]  Well, it doesn't work. You just press A and then I lose.
[01:35:58.230 --> 01:35:59.090]  Bring it on.
[01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:01.330]  Do I have to smash A as well?
[01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.870]  No.
[01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:02.250]  Yes.
[01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:03.010]  No.
[01:36:03.690 --> 01:36:04.310]  He does?
[01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.670]  No.
[01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:07.970]  Bring it on. Get over here.
[01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.850]  I'm waiting.
[01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:13.050]  I'm gonna grab your anus.
[01:36:13.210 --> 01:36:14.010]  Bring it on.
[01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:17.150]  Oh shit.
[01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:26.290]  I'll be honest, my depth perception is a little off.
[01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:33.050]  I thought that was bang on.
[01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:35.330]  How does this man have five stars?
[01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:39.570]  He has a god damn shadow.
[01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:41.890]  I was like a whole space over.
[01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:45.690]  What? What happened to me?
[01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:48.350]  I've lost all of my ability.
[01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:51.590]  That was dog.
[01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:55.370]  No!
[01:36:59.870 --> 01:37:00.590]  Why?
[01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:09.270]  This game is a shit show.
[01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:11.570]  What is this?
[01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:13.530]  Don't make us.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:17.170]  It's one on three.
[01:37:18.610 --> 01:37:19.250]  Wait, wait.
[01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.870]  Which three?
[01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:22.090]  Yeah!
[01:37:24.330 --> 01:37:25.530]  This sucks.
[01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:27.910]  This is bullshit. There's no way to win.
[01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:28.790]  This sucks.
[01:37:29.130 --> 01:37:30.450]  Are you sure it's clockwise?
[01:37:31.630 --> 01:37:32.110]  I don't know.
[01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:34.830]  I'm not a Nintendo guy.
[01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.710]  Wait.
[01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:40.970]  You cheated piece of shit!
[01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:55.550]  My palm!
[01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:00.150]  Nick almost ended the game I think.
[01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:03.650]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:05.570]  My hand was going nuts.
[01:38:05.650 --> 01:38:07.150]  Everyone chill out. Hold on a sec.
[01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:11.790]  Just in case Nick loses his mind again.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.120]  Those other three.
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:17.660]  Each!
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:19.820]  No!
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.320]  That's brutal dude.
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.100]  He likes to take out
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.160]  120 coins at a time.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:27.940]  It's not even that.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:29.800]  Nothing.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:31.920]  Each.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:34.080]  Great.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.000]  This is awful.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:37.440]  No!
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:40.460]  You asshole!
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.980]  You piece of shit!
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.280]  I'm going to piss my pants dude!
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:53.120]  I don't want to be on a team with this scumbag!
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.420]  Oh shit!
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.980]  It's getting bad!
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.160]  Oh his hand got hammock again.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:07.440]  This sucks!
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.900]  Okay hold on let's see.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:13.020]  Lean car. If you move left and right against the lean.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.000]  Against the lean.
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:17.140]  Oh but then you can probably fall off.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.020]  Ready Geoff? You and me Gavin.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.900]  Against the lean buddy.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.580]  And we're off!
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:29.660]  Here we go!
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.000]  That's right!
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.560]  Alright we got this Andrew.
[01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:36.440]  Yeah we're good.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.720]  It's neck and neck!
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.620]  No we got this.
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.540]  It's neck and neck!
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.320]  Come on!
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:47.860]  We got it!
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.600]  We gotta speed up!
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.140]  Come on!
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.960]  Nick blow it!
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.680]  You can't do it!
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.500]  You don't have it in you Nick!
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.020]  You suck!
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:11.000]  I'm sweating now.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.560]  I can't do the tug of war game again.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.940]  It's not in my palm.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.020]  I'm down to the bone.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:17.780]  I'm down to the bone.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:30.760]  Oh it's good.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:31.900]  Oh god.
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:32.980]  Fuck me.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.960]  All this way.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.060]  For nothing.
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.400]  Well not nothing.
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:41.680]  A nice big nothing stop.
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:44.720]  I bought three of these.
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:46.900]  Oh wow.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.320]  You're down to my level.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.580]  You really bought three fucking stars?
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:52.960]  This is my third one!
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.880]  Well maybe two.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.280]  Two or three.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.100]  You shouldn't buy those.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.520]  That's a waste of money.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.620]  Hey you're the one that put me in this position.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.500]  That wasn't my fault.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.840]  It's those goddamn dice.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.840]  Enjoy it Geoff!
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.000]  Enjoy that.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.100]  Why do I care? I don't have the money to pay for one anyway.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.360]  All my money got fucking stolen.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:22.920]  I'm broke.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:23.760]  I don't care.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.700]  Not tug of war.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.760]  Thank god.
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.700]  I think this whole game is going to come down to the exclamation spot.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:32.500]  With a big star swap.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:33.620]  Yeah.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.440]  No! This is just where you guys rob me!
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.560]  Let's do it.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:39.540]  No!
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.080]  Why? You don't have anything.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.320]  I have everything.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.360]  You're the guy.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.800]  You got the money.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.060]  Let's rob him senseless.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.900]  It's my birthday!
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.540]  It's my birthday!
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.800]  Well we're going to open you up like a pinata.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.380]  Fuck off! It's my birthday!
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:59.380]  Hit him!
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.620]  Give me my fucking money back.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.720]  Give me my money back.
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:04.200]  He snagged it.
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.980]  It's my birthday!
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:06.660]  Happy birthday!
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.900]  He's the easiest person in the world to hit, but when it's Andrew, nobody can fucking...
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:11.300]  Yeah!
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.440]  Yes! Get him again!
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.160]  No! He got it back!
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.340]  It's my birthday!
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.840]  Yes! Now it went right through me!
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.100]  Stop stealing all my money on my birthday!
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.720]  He got it all back, did he?
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:25.080]  No, I lost 20.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:26.260]  Okay, good.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.740]  Okay, good.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.040]  I lost 10. Okay.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:32.740]  Oh, sweet.
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.780]  I'll upload that.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:38.400]  Nightmare.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.120]  I'm still lightheaded from that minecart one.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:42.500]  I'm really...
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.660]  I'm really sorry.
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.320]  Nick, I can steal a star from him.
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.100]  No, you know what? You're right.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.220]  Nobody made you right!
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:51.760]  He's right.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.180]  Fuck you, you got five stars.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.880]  I'll take your...
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.320]  measly amount of money.
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.380]  To chop him down!
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.140]  I got no coin, stop chopping!
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:07.920]  Uh-oh.
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:09.340]  Ah, shit.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.540]  He's gonna try to steal money from me to prevent me from stealing from him.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:17.740]  Right.
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.640]  It's a real...
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.200]  not Robin Hood situation.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:25.480]  Yeah? That's me.
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.300]  Now Gavin's in position to...
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.800]  I fucking hate this game!
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.260]  Ah! I don't have any money.
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:37.000]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:39.980]  You just take it. Take my $13.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:41.660]  Just robbed.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.140]  At least I get $10.
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.700]  Bowser's a real prick in this game.
[01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.700]  Is there a game where he isn't a real prick?
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.740]  Well, sometimes he's...
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.580]  not as much of a prick.
[01:43:58.460 --> 01:43:59.620]  Ooh, hammer drop.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.700]  Woah, woah, woah.
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:03.920]  Woah, woah, woah.
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:05.120]  Woah, woah, woah. Hammer drop.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.580]  Try to get the coins to him when he throws down.
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.680]  But watch out because he throws hammers too!
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:12.860]  Jump.
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:16.300]  Was Hip Drop the old name for ground pound?
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.980]  Maybe. I thought it was always ground pound.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.100]  There's also a game in this called ground pound.
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:25.760]  It is true.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.060]  And that's what Gavin used to do in high school.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:29.240]  What?
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:29.920]  Nice.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:34.140]  I thought that's what happened when he left that job.
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:36.920]  He got a ground pound.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:38.220]  Oh, my supermarket job.
[01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:39.860]  Ow.
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:41.260]  Oh, I got a coin.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.520]  I would like a coin now.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.480]  I'd like a coin, please.
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:48.680]  Oh, give me that.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.360]  Son of a bitch.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:51.480]  I died.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.440]  I didn't know you could do that.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.140]  Don't do it. Use life.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:55.840]  Oh, I did.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:44:58.500]  Ow. Frickin' hammer. Ow.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.040]  Give me that.
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:02.040]  Oh, shit.
[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.000]  Oh, bag.
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:09.920]  I don't think it.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:12.500]  I really don't feel like any of us gain that much from that.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.020]  Yes.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:20.940]  I mean, I increased
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.280]  my personal wealth by something like 40%
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.920]  there, so it was kind of a big deal to me.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.160]  Maybe not for you fat cats.
[01:45:31.730 --> 01:45:33.190]  You get more coins from Luigi.
[01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:35.670]  How's that work?
[01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:38.550]  I'm not gonna tell you.
[01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:45.230]  Is that true?
[01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:46.330]  You're gonna get more coins from Luigi!
[01:45:47.190 --> 01:45:48.430]  You're not taking any of my coins!
[01:45:50.050 --> 01:45:51.570]  Stop taking my coins!
[01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:53.250]  Oh, wow, he didn't take that many.
[01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:55.290]  I've got enough to buy a star.
[01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:00.890]  Go, Donkey Kong.
[01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:02.870]  It's okay.
[01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:05.390]  You'll rebuild your wealth by the time you get to it.
[01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:06.130]  Go, Luigi.
[01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:08.530]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:10.310]  And Geoff will lap you in the meantime.
[01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:11.450]  Hey, I'm right here with the monkey.
[01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:13.910]  And I'll take his star.
[01:46:14.590 --> 01:46:14.930]  Okay.
[01:46:18.030 --> 01:46:19.190]  I don't wanna burst
[01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:19.890]  your balloon.
[01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:22.070]  Unless that's what I'm supposed to do right here.
[01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:23.130]  Yeah.
[01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.290]  Oh, balls.
[01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:27.090]  Oh, alternate.
[01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.790]  B can be used instead of Z.
[01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:36.230]  What?
[01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:41.990]  When the phone flashes full of air.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:49.860]  What happened to the sound?
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.440]  You okay over there, Geoff?
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:02.680]  What's going on?
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:04.560]  What's that?
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.100]  A and Z.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.600]  God damn it.
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:10.800]  A and Z wasn't working for me.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:11.720]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, Wario.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.900]  Stop what you're doing.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:14.980]  Nah.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.820]  Oh, my brain hurts
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:19.700]  from this bullshit.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.060]  We're gonna check on my balloon.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.600]  Boy, Geoff.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.880]  Do I go for the star or do I just
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.840]  keep my 50 and go around
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.220]  and start stealing?
[01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:47.010]  Oh, one more.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:50.840]  Shit.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:55.780]  Fuck.
[01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:02.130]  Hell yeah. That's okay.
[01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:04.730]  Give me the daisy one and I'll get all
[01:48:04.730 --> 01:48:06.610]  the coins. Nope, it's not on there.
[01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:09.090]  Fuck. Tightrope treachery.
[01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:10.510]  Why is the rope...
[01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:12.510]  Why is the R rope capitalized?
[01:48:14.010 --> 01:48:14.790]  The person
[01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:16.490]  on the tightrope must walk to the goal line.
[01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:17.990]  Players in boats can shoot their cannons.
[01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:22.810]  Move boat, shoot cannon.
[01:48:23.770 --> 01:48:24.630]  Seems simple.
[01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:26.670]  Oh, you're fighting cannonballs
[01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:27.430]  and the wind.
[01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:29.910]  Damn.
[01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:31.510]  Twins!
[01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:34.630]  Oh, it's like
[01:48:34.630 --> 01:48:35.070]  Sea of Thieves.
[01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:39.470]  Ow!
[01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:41.430]  You're shooting me!
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:46.800]  There we go.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.880]  Get that motherfucker. There you go.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:50.440]  Dumb dude.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.780]  How's he getting away
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:54.200]  with it?
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.780]  This rope sucks.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.180]  I like this rope.
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.260]  What am I doing?
[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:02.720]  No!
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.160]  Yes! Yes!
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.540]  Get him again, you loser!
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:08.580]  You suck!
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:09.120]  Come on!
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.200]  Knock him off!
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.880]  Come on!
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.380]  I'm so close!
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:15.680]  No!
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.180]  Ah, shit!
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.160]  Goddamnit.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.360]  We lost money!
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.380]  What determines whether we lose money
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:30.980]  playing these?
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.340]  I think the 1v3s.
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:35.140]  Okay.
[01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:36.620]  I guess.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:38.880]  Give me a 10!
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:40.800]  It's not a 10.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.360]  Alright, let me look at this.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.260]  No, don't.
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:45.600]  Make a guess.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:47.740]  Oh.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.480]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.260]  Well, it's pretty much...
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:55.660]  Uh-oh.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.660]  We're in the danger zone here.
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:05.320]  Steal Gavin's money.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:06.000]  I sure am.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.520]  Not my money, though, Shully.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:08.440]  Not my money!
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.500]  That's all I can do.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.920]  Alright, we just take 17.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:16.040]  Just 17.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:17.760]  Yeah!
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:18.900]  That was great.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.700]  Now we just have to make sure Gavin doesn't win.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.200]  This next game.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:26.040]  Boink.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.260]  Spin it!
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:29.860]  Oh, no!
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.380]  Here we go.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:32.960]  Oh, yeah!
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.540]  My cone hole!
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.480]  Ooh, fun.
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.140]  Crazy cutter.
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:44.440]  Shit!
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:46.200]  Dear God.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:52.420]  My Donkey Kong body is so big, it's hard to see some of the turns.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.640]  This frickin' thing again.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:56.640]  I hate it.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:00.380]  They're fuckin' lickin' it like in...
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:02.340]  Uh-oh.
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:05.040]  Oh, I should've started moving, I guess.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.040]  Yeah, there's plenty of time.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.980]  I think I'm acing this.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.680]  Wow, I can't see anything.
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:14.860]  Fuckin' thing.
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.180]  Oof.
[01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:22.540]  Oh, I feel real good about that.
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:23.820]  Ah, shit.
[01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.200]  65, I fuckin' blew it.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:28.980]  92, baby.
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:30.660]  Wow, what a win.
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:32.040]  Great job, guys.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:35.240]  I think yours looks pretty good as well, Geoff.
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:36.840]  I thought it was fine.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:38.780]  Game doesn't like me.
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:39.920]  What can I say?
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.240]  Oh, yeah?
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.780]  Nick, could you go ahead and change it back to Toad for me?
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:46.800]  Uh, no.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.160]  Hmm.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:51.460]  I mean, I would've if I coulda,
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.660]  but I didn'ta, so...
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:55.660]  I woulda if I coulda, but I didn'ta.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.360]  That is...
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:51:59.600]  unfortunate.
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:00.740]  I like it a lot.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.760]  I'm suckin' on these nothin' stars now.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:07.920]  You've invested a lot of money in those things.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.000]  Hey, Toad, what's up, dude?
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:14.040]  Yeah, your liquid assets are gone.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:15.740]  But you got a lot of equity.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:16.960]  A lot of investments.
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.920]  In what world are Gavin and Geoff first and second?
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.820]  Uh, this is the, uh,
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.020]  what do they call it in Deadpool?
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:24.720]  I don't know.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:25.460]  The Sacred Timeline?
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.940]  The Sacred Timeline. In the Sacred Timeline world.
[01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:34.670]  Oh, no.
[01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:36.850]  No, okay.
[01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:42.530]  Bombs!
[01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:44.150]  Oh, we're scampin' again.
[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.440]  I like this one.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.900]  Oh, bollocks.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.000]  What was Go?
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.160]  Tap B.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.520]  And then A is jump?
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:58.640]  Yes.
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:03.680]  Geoff goin' for it. Just a jump.
[01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:15.190]  Ah, balls.
[01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:18.550]  And never go for it.
[01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:24.390]  No, no, not like this.
[01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:26.510]  Get there, get there, get there, get there.
[01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:28.310]  Get there, get there, get there.
[01:53:28.450 --> 01:53:29.590]  Oh, shit.
[01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:32.250]  Gavin, what are you doin'?
[01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:32.490]  Gavin!
[01:53:34.710 --> 01:53:36.110]  I'm still tapping the B button.
[01:53:36.190 --> 01:53:36.310]  No!
[01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:40.950]  I'm freakin' out.
[01:53:41.010 --> 01:53:41.110]  Fuck.
[01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:44.870]  I ended up hovering over like...
[01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:46.490]  What was I doin'?
[01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:52.270]  I almost died Animal Crossing.
[01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:53.250]  I don't know where I ended up.
[01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:57.830]  Oh, no.
[01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:59.390]  No, no, no, no.
[01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:00.050]  Okay.
[01:54:01.930 --> 01:54:03.370]  Hey, I just saw my audio
[01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:04.050]  stopped recording.
[01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:05.510]  No!
[01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:08.270]  Start another one.
[01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:08.710]  We have Craig.
[01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:11.430]  How'd it stop?
[01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:12.350]  I don't know.
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:16.460]  How long was that?
[01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:20.610]  I can't tell. Maybe an hour.
[01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:22.530]  Shit.
[01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:25.270]  Well, balls.
[01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:27.270]  I'm back in it, fellas.
[01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:28.630]  Testing, testing. Okay, I'm back in.
[01:54:28.630 --> 01:54:30.610]  My first star of the game.
[01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:38.850]  What's it doin'?
[01:54:38.850 --> 01:54:39.790]  I'll be back in.
[01:54:41.150 --> 01:54:42.150]  Geoff disconnected?
[01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:43.650]  What is goin' on?
[01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:45.650]  Dude, I don't know.
[01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:46.770]  What's goin' on?
[01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:49.810]  Your controller's dying.
[01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:51.970]  You're not recording audio.
[01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:54.390]  I don't know what happened to me today.
[01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:56.210]  I set all this up yesterday.
[01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:58.490]  I record audio all the time. I never drop audio.
[01:54:58.570 --> 01:54:59.750]  I don't know what happened.
[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.630]  Geoff's back.
[01:55:01.650 --> 01:55:03.410]  Did you stop it while you were rummaging around
[01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:04.790]  trying to charge your controller?
[01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:06.350]  It's entirely possible.
[01:55:07.770 --> 01:55:09.110]  Well, Nick will find out.
[01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:10.310]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:13.750]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.770]  Shit.
[01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:18.410]  Uh-oh.
[01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:19.810]  Blam!
[01:55:21.190 --> 01:55:22.370]  The house is gonna get struck
[01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:23.190]  by lightning now.
[01:55:23.190 --> 01:55:23.370]  Oh.
[01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:29.370]  Oh, it doesn't strike twice, Geoff.
[01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:33.430]  I can tell you a story about it doing it.
[01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:39.110]  Boink.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.340]  Oh, boy.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:51.980]  We've been going for two hours.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.280]  Sure have.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:55.920]  Sure have.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.300]  I can't believe you have five stars.
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:00.580]  And one hour of audio.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:03.280]  That's what Craig's for.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:04.520]  That's what Craig's for.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:06.620]  Oh, right.
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.360]  No, I royally
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:14.820]  Yeah.
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.800]  I'm with you, Nick.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:20.540]  I got hit by my own shell a little bit.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:21.240]  Oh!
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.860]  Oh, fuck.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:23.920]  Turned it around.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.740]  Sucker, that one. Hate it.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:27.900]  Yeah.
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.440]  Let's only do that one.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.480]  Let's keep it on loot.
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.060]  Look how much money you have.
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.320]  In last place.
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:37.660]  For now.
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.140]  Ooh!
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:39.940]  No!
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:43.380]  Geoff, you gotta get there.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:44.700]  I'll work on it.
[01:56:49.710 --> 01:56:51.690]  You gots to beat Gavin there.
[01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:52.130]  Oh.
[01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:53.570]  Oh.
[01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.950]  Oh.
[01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.050]  He's not gonna risk the star.
[01:56:59.170 --> 01:57:00.750]  He's just gonna jump as soon as he can.
[01:57:03.730 --> 01:57:04.690]  That'd be like...
[01:57:04.690 --> 01:57:06.090]  Oh, hang on.
[01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:09.730]  You said now and it really confused me.
[01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.910]  Now.
[01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:13.450]  Shut up.
[01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:20.330]  Wait.
[01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:21.590]  I've made a mistake.
[01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:25.510]  If I'm involved, this is not good.
[01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:28.830]  Wario, Wario.
[01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:33.150]  Stop missing the block!
[01:57:34.530 --> 01:57:34.830]  No!
[01:57:35.530 --> 01:57:35.950]  No!
[01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:38.530]  Wait, I don't have...
[01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:38.990]  Yeah!
[01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:42.210]  I'm the birthday boy!
[01:57:43.330 --> 01:57:45.190]  I'm the birthday boy!
[01:57:45.190 --> 01:57:46.770]  Happy birthday!
[01:57:49.290 --> 01:57:49.810]  Oh!
[01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:51.930]  Oh!
[01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:53.610]  Oh!
[01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:54.650]  All of them?
[01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:55.610]  All of them?
[01:57:56.630 --> 01:57:58.430]  Oh my god.
[01:57:58.730 --> 01:58:00.150]  Wait, I don't even get your money?
[01:58:00.450 --> 01:58:01.650]  This is bullshit!
[01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:02.550]  Oh!
[01:58:05.170 --> 01:58:06.310]  Andrew, happy birthday.
[01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:07.110]  What a reverse!
[01:58:08.850 --> 01:58:09.750]  This suck!
[01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:11.410]  Everyone hit that freaking space!
[01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:13.070]  Let's do it again. Redo.
[01:58:13.530 --> 01:58:13.730]  Shit!
[01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:18.230]  Happy, happy birthday, Andrew.
[01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:19.450]  It's coming home!
[01:58:19.450 --> 01:58:20.390]  Gavin got you...
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:23.110]  Gavin got you the biggest gift of all. Five stars.
[01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:24.070]  Five stars.
[01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:26.030]  Son of a bitch!
[01:58:26.410 --> 01:58:27.470]  And he did it too.
[01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:29.490]  I did it to myself!
[01:58:30.110 --> 01:58:31.350]  Okay, let's...
[01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:34.470]  Oh no, this is the hand game.
[01:58:35.130 --> 01:58:36.230]  This is the palm one.
[01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.650]  Oh god.
[01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:38.730]  Let's rob Nick.
[01:58:40.230 --> 01:58:41.290]  It's worth it.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:44.960]  Oh!
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:48.600]  As if I need that right now. I just lost five stars.
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:52.200]  Stop doing it!
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.920]  Wario, do some fucking paddling!
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.680]  Use your strength, Mario!
[01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:57.180]  No!
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:57.700]  No!
[01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:00.080]  Mario, get off of the bank!
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.600]  Get off of the bank!
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:02.820]  God damn it!
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:03.780]  No!
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:08.100]  God damn it!
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.160]  It hurts!
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:10.040]  God!
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.660]  Keep going!
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:15.280]  Yeah!
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.280]  Oh god!
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:19.040]  Fucking anus!
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:19.680]  Jesus!
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.480]  What's that hand on the screen?
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:22.980]  I don't know.
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:25.080]  What's going on?
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:26.600]  Ow, my palm!
[01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:32.410]  This game sucks.
[01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:33.110]  I'm winning!
[01:59:34.130 --> 01:59:35.730]  Ten turns to go!
[01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:38.570]  Fuck!
[01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:41.250]  I hate this game.
[01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:42.550]  It's shit.
[01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:44.330]  I can't believe
[01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:46.480]  how many fucking catastrophes
[01:59:47.010 --> 01:59:47.710]  I've been today.
[01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:49.110]  I'm so sorry, guys.
[01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:50.790]  God damn.
[01:59:52.570 --> 01:59:54.190]  I mean, this seems a little unnecessary.
[01:59:55.530 --> 01:59:55.950]  What do you mean?
[01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:58.150]  I want payment for the really good gift.
[02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:04.170]  Most people don't ask for things in return.
[02:00:04.170 --> 02:00:04.490]  Cheers.
[02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:07.290]  It depends on the gift.
[02:00:11.730 --> 02:00:13.130]  Like, I'm sure with politicians,
[02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:14.850]  they do want stuff in return.
[02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:16.690]  You know what? That's a good point.
[02:00:19.810 --> 02:00:21.250]  Also the Sopranos do.
[02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.750]  Huh.
[02:00:27.190 --> 02:00:28.570]  Geoff, you're our only hope, I think.
[02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:31.490]  Yeah, I'll buy it.
[02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:34.910]  I guess I'll do it.
[02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:37.310]  Man, if anyone took a five-minute break
[02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:39.250]  from the stream, they must be wondering...
[02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:40.490]  What the hell just happened?
[02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:41.270]  Hahaha!
[02:00:44.430 --> 02:00:45.390]  Tide's turned.
[02:00:46.250 --> 02:00:47.530]  Tide has definitely turned.
[02:00:48.190 --> 02:00:48.930]  I blame the moon.
[02:00:50.490 --> 02:00:51.130]  Hahaha!
[02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:55.390]  Come on!
[02:00:56.610 --> 02:00:58.130]  Oh, it's Geoff. That's cool.
[02:00:58.290 --> 02:00:58.850]  Good job, Geoff.
[02:00:58.950 --> 02:01:01.550]  30 coins? That's a lot.
[02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:04.890]  And I got that.
[02:01:05.170 --> 02:01:06.950]  This turn never ends.
[02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:08.450]  Hahaha!
[02:01:15.650 --> 02:01:16.770]  What's it gonna be?
[02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:18.790]  Jump across the tops of the teetering towers.
[02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:21.170]  Depending on where you land, the towers tilt in different directions.
[02:01:21.330 --> 02:01:23.290]  Jump and A. Once the tower teeters over...
[02:01:24.150 --> 02:01:24.570]  Oh.
[02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:26.030]  Okay.
[02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:28.690]  It doesn't sound like that.
[02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:31.310]  Got a cutscene?
[02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.210]  Oh, Christ.
[02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:34.030]  Oh, that's cool.
[02:01:35.050 --> 02:01:35.910]  What are you doing?
[02:01:36.450 --> 02:01:37.090]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:38.950]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:39.130 --> 02:01:40.170]  That wasn't Geoff.
[02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.950]  Hahaha!
[02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:45.470]  I was the first one.
[02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:46.510]  I wasn't the second one.
[02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:49.130]  Have a compilation of these single-player
[02:01:49.130 --> 02:01:50.710]  immediate mis-turns.
[02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.550]  Hahaha!
[02:01:58.230 --> 02:01:59.430]  Human disconnection!
[02:01:59.790 --> 02:02:00.190]  Geoff!
[02:02:00.610 --> 02:02:01.970]  God damn it!
[02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:05.150]  Geoff, we're getting you a
[02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:07.510]  200-foot Ethernet cable next time.
[02:02:08.230 --> 02:02:09.210]  I want to point out to the chat
[02:02:09.210 --> 02:02:10.990]  that yesterday, in real life,
[02:02:11.070 --> 02:02:13.170]  I gave Geoff a USB-to-Ethernet
[02:02:13.170 --> 02:02:14.750]  adapter so he could go wired.
[02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:16.410]  I used it!
[02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:19.330]  You used it to put a wire into the wireless!
[02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:21.430]  That's all I can do!
[02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:22.690]  I have a signal extender!
[02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:23.850]  It's the best thing I got!
[02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:27.110]  Next time we do this,
[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:29.090]  I'll run a 100-foot Ethernet cable from down here.
[02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:30.050]  Geoff has come to play.
[02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:32.650]  No, I haven't.
[02:02:32.650 --> 02:02:33.110]  Hahaha!
[02:02:35.210 --> 02:02:36.090]  You're in second, Geoff.
[02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:37.690]  You gotta represent...
[02:02:37.690 --> 02:02:38.070]  Gasp!
[02:02:40.810 --> 02:02:41.330]  Yeah!
[02:02:42.990 --> 02:02:44.490]  Okay. Push.
[02:02:45.170 --> 02:02:46.550]  I'm pretty sure when Geoff's out,
[02:02:46.670 --> 02:02:48.190]  the audio goes back to normal.
[02:02:49.410 --> 02:02:50.710]  I think so.
[02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:51.970]  Nah, I can't be right.
[02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:53.490]  I'm pretty sure it is.
[02:02:53.490 --> 02:02:54.670]  Geoff rejoices like...
[02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:57.490]  I don't think that's correct.
[02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:58.150]  Shit!
[02:02:58.150 --> 02:02:58.450]  Shit!
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.320]  Uh-oh!
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:04.180]  Fuck!
[02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:11.550]  Mario!
[02:03:12.150 --> 02:03:13.970]  You worthless turd, stop spinning!
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:24.280]  Ah, shit!
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:25.900]  Yes!
[02:03:26.020 --> 02:03:27.160]  New record!
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.220]  Thank you!
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:31.220]  I got a rough start on that one.
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:36.680]  My brain hasn't adjusted to
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.660]  winning. I'm still in the mindset
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:40.700]  of I'm at the bottom, I need to attack Gavin.
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:42.520]  Ooh, now here we go.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:43.600]  Well, that's how you keep winning.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.300]  Don't let up.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:48.540]  It's not enough for you to beat
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:50.520]  Gavin, Andrew. You need to punish him.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:51.200]  What do you mean?
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.880]  It's the eye of the tiger.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.960]  It's the mindset he's gonna have to have to win.
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.020]  Another one.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.660]  Another fake one.
[02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:15.430]  Is this good?
[02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:25.010]  It took you so long to steal
[02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:27.050]  those five stars, Gavin. That's a lot
[02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:28.510]  of work to...
[02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:30.090]  I only stole one, didn't I?
[02:04:31.210 --> 02:04:32.330]  I had two stolen.
[02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:34.750]  One of them I was
[02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:35.990]  taking mine back.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.020]  Man, going into
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:44.000]  fourth place has really distracted me from the
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:44.460]  minigames.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.600]  Musical mushroom.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.520]  What is this?
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:50.700]  Is this what we did before?
[02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:53.740]  Jump.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:54.740]  Jump.
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:55.840]  Oh no.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.440]  We don't have audio, Geoff.
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:01.220]  Oh.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.220]  Oh, that's great.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:05.240]  Oh wait, wait.
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:06.300]  I didn't read that last bit. Shit.
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.340]  I didn't either.
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.380]  Sounds like we're all at a disadvantage.
[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:11.380]  Nah.
[02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:19.500]  Now!
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:22.060]  Fuck.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:23.240]  Oh shit.
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.300]  Come on. Yes!
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:26.780]  Yes! Really?
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.660]  That's great, Andrew. Thanks.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:30.720]  Music schmusic.
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:31.620]  Team no audio.
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:34.560]  Oh shit.
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:35.680]  He doesn't need the money.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.100]  I'm about to get hit by all of you.
[02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:40.000]  I think I do.
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:43.340]  This sucks. I know how you feel, Gavin.
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:45.060]  Go rob somebody else.
[02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.060]  No, I'm afraid I can't do that.
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.380]  Oh, he's going for stars.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:51.040]  That's hey. I respect it.
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.080]  I gotta.
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:56.080]  That's my star.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:05:58.500]  Well.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:01.360]  Oh, well look at that.
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:02.040]  Just like that.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.740]  I have two stars.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:06.960]  Never thought I'd see the day.
[02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:09.500]  Looking good, Nick. It looks good on you.
[02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:10.580]  Hey, thanks, man.
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.440]  Oops.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.420]  Ooh.
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.260]  Like an insult to injury.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.820]  Hey, Gav. Welcome to where I was.
[02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:23.490]  I'll do it.
[02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:28.650]  Anything but the rope.
[02:06:29.490 --> 02:06:30.730]  Anything but. Okay, good.
[02:06:32.590 --> 02:06:33.150]  Shit.
[02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:36.770]  I just watched someone lose this.
[02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:41.570]  I've only seen someone lose this.
[02:06:42.370 --> 02:06:42.890]  Yeah.
[02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.290]  So what do I do on the cloud?
[02:06:46.610 --> 02:06:47.310]  I just butt stomp?
[02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:48.850]  Yeah, butt stomp.
[02:06:49.110 --> 02:06:52.590]  Ground pound that cloud to water him.
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:58.620]  I'm on my skateboard.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.160]  Jump in the logs.
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:03.120]  Get the goddamn away from me, you bastard.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.560]  There's another log.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:07.260]  It's a home stretch.
[02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:08.680]  That's a log that falls.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:10.320]  On my face.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:10.860]  You can't do it.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.280]  You can't do it.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:14.780]  I keep trying, though. I keep trying.
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.000]  Keep trying to ace it.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:18.560]  Get in the water, you worthless plant.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.160]  No! Get off my asshole!
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:21.400]  Fuck.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.180]  Get off my freaking ass!
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:25.780]  Oh, yeah, there you go.
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:26.440]  Get him!
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:26.980]  Get him!
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:34.940]  I suck! I freaking suck!
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:39.760]  Maybe they made it easier to win in the newer games.
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:40.520]  Oh, baby.
[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:43.380]  15! Minus 15.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:45.420]  Woo! That's a lot.
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:47.300]  That's a lot when you ain't got a lot.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.720]  Yeah. Oh, thank God
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:50.360]  that was not a 1.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:53.360]  Earlier Gavin wouldn't have sweat 15.
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:07:54.940]  15 to current Gavin?
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:56.120]  Recession Gavin?
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.340]  Uh-oh, Gavin.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:07:59.200]  Alright.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.120]  Look forward to that.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.280]  That's phenomenal.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:11.140]  Tide really turned.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:13.120]  Big turn.
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:16.520]  Not many turns left.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.840]  Don't, don't, don't, no!
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:19.900]  Oh, sweet, thanks.
[02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:24.400]  I'm a benevolent man.
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.780]  Team Benevolent.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:31.500]  Plan G.
[02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:33.340]  Hey, Plan G.
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.620]  You ready, Nick?
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:37.700]  Yeah, hey, man. I've got some good ideas.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:39.740]  I'll call it.
[02:08:40.620 --> 02:08:41.180]  Okay.
[02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:43.040]  Oh, God. What are we doing?
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.620]  We're doing left and then we're doing right.
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:46.300]  Alright. Ready, Nick?
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:48.500]  Yeah. Alright.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.040]  Right. Left.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:51.180]  Right. Left.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:52.300]  Right. Left.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:53.060]  Right. Left.
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.260]  Right. Left.
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:56.180]  Right. Left.
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:57.860]  Right. Left.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:00.600]  Right. Left.
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.640]  Right. Stop. Left.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:03.440]  Oh, shit.
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:05.200]  Right. Left.
[02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:07.160]  Right. Left.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:10.360]  Right. Left.
[02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:11.000]  No.
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:14.080]  Right. Left.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.440]  Right. Left. Right.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:17.860]  Left. Right.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:19.500]  Left. Right.
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:21.740]  Right. Left.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.340]  Left.
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:24.120]  Gavin.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.640]  I believed in you.
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.260]  Why was that my fault?
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:32.320]  Because of your ability to do it right.
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:40.860]  Gavin doesn't even have enough coins now to buy the star.
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:41.860]  Oh, dear.
[02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:43.800]  Oh, eat away.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:44.720]  Nick.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.620]  Ah, dear.
[02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:55.230]  Yep.
[02:09:56.690 --> 02:09:57.090]  Yep.
[02:09:59.190 --> 02:10:01.550]  I hope this has been a good birthday for you.
[02:10:01.770 --> 02:10:02.110]  No.
[02:10:02.610 --> 02:10:03.630]  Andrew, give it back.
[02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:06.410]  Do it. I dare you.
[02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:07.870]  Do a star swap.
[02:10:09.570 --> 02:10:10.370]  Do it, son.
[02:10:13.190 --> 02:10:14.550]  Oh, he's going to leave it up to fate.
[02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:16.470]  Oh, yeah. Chance.
[02:10:21.090 --> 02:10:23.570]  No. I was trying to avoid that.
[02:10:24.230 --> 02:10:25.190]  Oh, no.
[02:10:25.250 --> 02:10:26.550]  Oh, no.
[02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:28.590]  Will Andrew hand all of his shit to Jack?
[02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:33.610]  Everyone's giving him away.
[02:10:34.150 --> 02:10:34.750]  No.
[02:10:35.710 --> 02:10:37.210]  What are the chances of that?
[02:10:37.230 --> 02:10:37.750]  No.
[02:10:40.090 --> 02:10:42.110]  This is the craziest game
[02:10:42.110 --> 02:10:43.190]  I've ever seen.
[02:10:46.690 --> 02:10:48.610]  Oh, it's really just one star.
[02:10:48.750 --> 02:10:49.750]  It's just one star.
[02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:50.290]  Oh, wow.
[02:10:50.410 --> 02:10:53.230]  I thought you had none.
[02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.910]  I forgot.
[02:10:55.290 --> 02:10:56.590]  Oh, shit.
[02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:59.290]  Oh, shit.
[02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:01.590]  All that drama
[02:11:01.590 --> 02:11:02.770]  for one star.
[02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:05.230]  That was not nearly as bad as I thought.
[02:11:05.850 --> 02:11:06.370]  Oh, okay.
[02:11:07.330 --> 02:11:10.930]  Oh, not again.
[02:11:11.650 --> 02:11:12.650]  God almighty.
[02:11:13.050 --> 02:11:13.710]  I hate this.
[02:11:14.070 --> 02:11:16.050]  Every time I think I do good, then I do bad.
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:22.440]  Oh, shit.
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:24.660]  Oh, I can do that.
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:25.760]  He looks like a cat.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.300]  Cat yawning.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:35.960]  I don't know why, but this music makes me want to play
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:36.780]  Super Mario Sunshine.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:37.620]  What music?
[02:11:44.650 --> 02:11:45.610]  Why can't I grab
[02:11:45.610 --> 02:11:46.430]  the smeggin' thing?
[02:11:55.050 --> 02:11:56.490]  I think mine's pretty spot on.
[02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:59.750]  Uh, close.
[02:12:01.110 --> 02:12:01.590]  90!
[02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.290]  Damn.
[02:12:02.290 --> 02:12:03.010]  Damn.
[02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:04.290]  98.
[02:12:05.710 --> 02:12:07.750]  94. Nice job, Gavin.
[02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:10.230]  I'm good with faces.
[02:12:12.930 --> 02:12:13.770]  Holy shit.
[02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:14.790]  Last five.
[02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:16.690]  Give me some chump cherry.
[02:12:17.170 --> 02:12:18.550]  Let's see who he thinks is gonna win.
[02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:21.390]  Now I will announce the current standings.
[02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:24.310]  If Geoff wins this game,
[02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:25.010]  I swear to God.
[02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:26.950]  It'll be awesome.
[02:12:27.590 --> 02:12:29.190]  I've earned a lot of fucking stars today.
[02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:30.610]  What?!
[02:12:31.150 --> 02:12:31.470]  Wow!
[02:12:33.370 --> 02:12:35.290]  From this round until the game ends,
[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:37.030]  blue spaces and red spaces will be worth twice as much.
[02:12:37.130 --> 02:12:38.950]  Also, when you pass the start, your bonus is now worth 20.
[02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:41.330]  This is truly amazing. If used correctly, this is the perfect set for a comeback.
[02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:42.850]  Keep your eyes on Super Stardom. Good luck.
[02:12:43.530 --> 02:12:43.850]  Comeback.
[02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:46.510]  See that? I told you Nick could read.
[02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.610]  Nobody believed me.
[02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:50.370]  I believed you and me.
[02:12:50.430 --> 02:12:52.190]  I've been standing up for you for a while now, Nick.
[02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:54.610]  Hey, you know what? It's appreciated, Geoff. Thank you.
[02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:56.290]  What is the even...
[02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:58.290]  Who is even up there? Bowser. Oh, God.
[02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:01.770]  Alright, man.
[02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:11.210]  Now we have an interesting situation developing here.
[02:13:11.710 --> 02:13:13.090]  He's just gonna get his star back.
[02:13:13.670 --> 02:13:13.830]  Yeah.
[02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:18.650]  Undoing
[02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:19.970]  all of the drama.
[02:13:21.150 --> 02:13:21.910]  What a bang.
[02:13:25.290 --> 02:13:26.710]  I can't believe you did a full
[02:13:26.710 --> 02:13:28.890]  star swap and one turn later you've completely
[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:30.010]  recovered from it.
[02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:32.310]  Yeah, that never happens.
[02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:34.390]  It's his fucking birthday. That's true.
[02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:38.290]  Ow.
[02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:42.430]  If it's tug of war, I'm not even pulling.
[02:13:43.130 --> 02:13:43.970]  Why bother?
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:50.560]  I thought about swapping hands, but I don't need both hands to be dead.
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:51.720]  Not even pulling.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:13:58.820]  Go, thumb. Go.
[02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:04.370]  There we go.
[02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:05.690]  Come believe it.
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:08.430]  Hey, guys, I got something for you.
[02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.850]  Hold on a second.
[02:14:10.130 --> 02:14:12.450]  Open up your mouths like little baby birds.
[02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:13.710]  No!
[02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:17.070]  It's everywhere!
[02:14:17.690 --> 02:14:18.770]  It's everywhere!
[02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:22.290]  This isn't how glory holes work.
[02:14:23.950 --> 02:14:25.970]  Has that come out yet? No.
[02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:30.110]  Not yet. Last four turns.
[02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:32.250]  Oh, balls.
[02:14:33.330 --> 02:14:34.870]  I'm taking the long way.
[02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:42.570]  Alright, just plow through.
[02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:48.050]  I swear to God.
[02:14:48.690 --> 02:14:49.630]  Oh, dear.
[02:14:50.730 --> 02:14:51.550]  Oh, dear.
[02:14:52.130 --> 02:14:53.570]  I can't watch. Put it to chance.
[02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:54.670]  Put it to chance, Gavin.
[02:14:55.730 --> 02:14:57.550]  Yeah, alright. Let's do that one last.
[02:14:57.590 --> 02:15:00.110]  Let the stars align in such a way...
[02:15:00.110 --> 02:15:00.770]  I can't watch.
[02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:04.310]  Uh-oh.
[02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:06.810]  Let's get a bit of decay.
[02:15:08.110 --> 02:15:08.750]  Uh-oh.
[02:15:09.810 --> 02:15:12.150]  Well, Nick, apologies in advance.
[02:15:13.690 --> 02:15:14.070]  Oh.
[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:18.530]  That could have been worse, I suppose.
[02:15:19.610 --> 02:15:20.010]  Could have been.
[02:15:20.070 --> 02:15:21.070]  It could have cost you two stars.
[02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:22.970]  That's all my money.
[02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:25.510]  I'm going to give it directly to Bowser, don't worry.
[02:15:26.050 --> 02:15:26.650]  You sure are.
[02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:30.410]  Oh.
[02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:33.210]  That audio.
[02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:41.870]  Oh, we've been recording so long, my headphones
[02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:42.690]  are running out of battery.
[02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:45.230]  Oh.
[02:15:47.150 --> 02:15:48.250]  Plug him into Ethernet.
[02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.990]  PoE.
[02:15:52.090 --> 02:15:52.450]  Oh!
[02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:54.550]  Cheers, Geoff. No!
[02:15:54.990 --> 02:15:56.170]  Oh, man. No!
[02:15:57.130 --> 02:15:58.370]  You've done it twice now.
[02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:01.130]  Yeah, but I really didn't want to do it that time.
[02:16:01.130 --> 02:16:02.510]  I didn't care the other time.
[02:16:04.610 --> 02:16:05.670]  God damn it!
[02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:09.850]  We've never played the fucking Shy Guy game!
[02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:16.020]  Oh, my eyes are watering.
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:16.960]  This is going to be...
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:18.600]  I have to close one eye to do this.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:20.380]  It's just a freaking circle again.
[02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:27.370]  God damn it, Geoff.
[02:16:27.610 --> 02:16:28.530]  Oh, Nick.
[02:16:29.230 --> 02:16:30.250]  My eye's watering.
[02:16:30.930 --> 02:16:33.370]  Oh, this is a sad sack.
[02:16:35.090 --> 02:16:37.490]  I fucking ruined that.
[02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:38.990]  I had to close my eye.
[02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:40.190]  That fucked everything up.
[02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:41.310]  Oh, I pissed that one up.
[02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:43.570]  I sausage that one.
[02:16:43.670 --> 02:16:44.710]  Oh, wow.
[02:16:49.630 --> 02:16:50.230]  Boom!
[02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.930]  Fucking eye.
[02:16:59.410 --> 02:17:01.030]  I thought it was A.
[02:17:03.510 --> 02:17:07.190]  No, I had to...
[02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:08.850]  My eye started to water a little bit.
[02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:10.630]  And then I had sunscreen on because I went swimming earlier.
[02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:13.490]  And so my eye started in the middle of those.
[02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.650]  Not again.
[02:17:14.970 --> 02:17:16.530]  Chance. All for chance.
[02:17:17.550 --> 02:17:18.530]  Here we go. I don't even care.
[02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:20.390]  Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to run over here.
[02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:22.670]  I've closed my eyes. Am I under it?
[02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.210]  Okay.
[02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:25.910]  Sure, why not.
[02:17:26.430 --> 02:17:27.050]  Give me everything.
[02:17:29.090 --> 02:17:30.050]  What is it?
[02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:31.630]  Oh, god damn it.
[02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:34.750]  In the middle. Here we go. Close eyes.
[02:17:34.750 --> 02:17:35.310]  Hey!
[02:17:35.850 --> 02:17:39.470]  You just completely undid the last one.
[02:17:43.090 --> 02:17:43.730]  Yep.
[02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:46.090]  Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:48.150]  Great. Fantastic.
[02:17:48.810 --> 02:17:50.830]  At least those coins are going to get the star.
[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:54.310]  Like intended.
[02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:57.750]  God damn.
[02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.610]  Well,
[02:18:01.850 --> 02:18:04.930]  I need somebody to hit the question mark.
[02:18:05.490 --> 02:18:06.170]  Oh, god.
[02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:07.710]  I almost pressed no.
[02:18:08.550 --> 02:18:10.170]  I was just mashing buttons.
[02:18:11.730 --> 02:18:12.210]  Hey!
[02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:13.010]  Back on the board.
[02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:14.910]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[02:18:15.130 --> 02:18:15.870]  The board for fourth.
[02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:17.510]  Alright, Nick.
[02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:21.190]  I get 20 coins though, right?
[02:18:22.130 --> 02:18:23.050]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.730]  Oh, cheers.
[02:18:24.850 --> 02:18:25.490]  And then six.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:30.260]  Wow.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:31.680]  Not bad.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.160]  Got my first star.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:35.020]  God damn.
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:37.220]  Geoff.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.120]  Roll three or ten.
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:39.940]  Fuck!
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:45.800]  Hot road.
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:46.880]  Hot road jump.
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:50.240]  Oh, man. My fucking sunscreen eye.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:52.860]  I can't be precise.
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:55.400]  Oh, no.
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.820]  I've always lost this as a kid.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:00.480]  This one's impossible though.
[02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:04.080]  Oh, great. I'm fucking blinded.
[02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:06.840]  If you thought your depth perception was off on the crane game.
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:10.440]  When do I jump?
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:12.400]  Right there. I got it.
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:15.020]  Wait, so we all...
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.220]  Oh, wait. We all lose?
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:18.600]  I think just I lost.
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.260]  Oh, sweet. I'll take that.
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:21.880]  Oh, fuck.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:21.940]  Oh, shit.
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:26.920]  Well, last two turns.
[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:28.440]  Two turns left.
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:30.300]  I'm a little boned here.
[02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:35.330]  You have a real star this time?
[02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:38.910]  What if...
[02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:40.970]  Ah, you bastard.
[02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:42.610]  You couldn't even give me a real one at the end.
[02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.330]  Mario looking like,
[02:19:45.390 --> 02:19:46.470]  did I do that?
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:52.720]  Thanks for spinning that around for me.
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:54.980]  Did I do bonus stars in this?
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:19:57.900]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.320]  Oh, hey, what's up?
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:02.360]  Hey, man.
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:07.000]  Do you think it'll give me a star for being the Geoffiest?
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:10.880]  No, I think that honor may go to me.
[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:12.620]  That's fair.
[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:13.920]  Come on!
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:18.340]  Oh, you're not going to get your fifth star?
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:19.440]  No!
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.460]  Oh, yes!
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:23.340]  Yeah, buddy!
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:25.020]  Alright.
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:26.080]  Leave it to chance, Geoff.
[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:27.940]  Yeah, of course.
[02:20:29.340 --> 02:20:30.680]  Alright, I'm going to go over here.
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:32.260]  I'm going to close my eyes.
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.400]  My eyes are closed.
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:35.240]  No!
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:38.940]  I'm going to go back over to the right side.
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:39.900]  I'm going to close my eyes.
[02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:44.180]  I'm going to count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:44.500]  Jump.
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:45.140]  No!
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:45.640]  Oh, dear.
[02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:48.260]  I'm going to close my eyes.
[02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:51.160]  I'm going to count down from 3.
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:53.100]  3, 2, 1.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:53.420]  Jump.
[02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:58.340]  No!
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.120]  No!
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:04.080]  No!
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.460]  It's my birthday!
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:10.740]  God!
[02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:14.380]  Frickin' Koopa don't know shit.
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:18.440]  Oh, this is shite, Geoff.
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:25.620]  This sucks.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.440]  Piece of shit.
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:36.820]  Stop it.
[02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:40.970]  Get out.
[02:21:41.470 --> 02:21:42.410]  Stop shooting shit.
[02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:45.390]  Ow!
[02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:48.290]  Cut it out.
[02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:51.770]  Gavin, for God's sake.
[02:21:51.770 --> 02:21:52.750]  Give up.
[02:21:53.410 --> 02:21:55.350]  The line's right there. Why would I give up?
[02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:56.710]  Yeah, just give up.
[02:21:57.570 --> 02:21:58.350]  Hit me.
[02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:00.650]  Stop moving me, game.
[02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:02.590]  I'm lined up where I want to be.
[02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:04.490]  I didn't think you'd hit me once and the wind wasn't even there.
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:11.530]  It's bullshit.
[02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:12.710]  The game keeps moving you.
[02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:14.130]  Oh, that's stealing money.
[02:22:15.010 --> 02:22:16.830]  Let me roll a 24 and I'll be there.
[02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.850]  Last turn.
[02:22:17.850 --> 02:22:19.570]  Here we go.
[02:22:22.690 --> 02:22:25.730]  Can I roll a 10?
[02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:27.430]  Don't do it.
[02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:27.890]  Okay.
[02:22:28.770 --> 02:22:30.130]  Hey, what's up, Nick?
[02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:32.250]  DK?
[02:22:35.930 --> 02:22:37.930]  You greedy fuck.
[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:38.910]  Take it again.
[02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:42.510]  You greedy piece of shit.
[02:22:44.170 --> 02:22:45.450]  I want some coins.
[02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:47.370]  Hip flex, whatever they called it.
[02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:47.710]  What was it?
[02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:50.370]  What do they call it?
[02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:52.670]  Hip drop.
[02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:55.170]  There you go.
[02:22:56.450 --> 02:22:57.430]  The game's called Ground Pound.
[02:22:58.830 --> 02:23:00.210]  This is a little bit of a harder one.
[02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:01.190]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:01.690 --> 02:23:02.910]  Don't get a spike up the anus.
[02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:05.510]  You can even see them.
[02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:12.300]  Uh-oh, Andrew.
[02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:15.420]  Oh, no, that's not one.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:17.080]  Damn.
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:17.940]  Whoops.
[02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:18.920]  Good hit.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:20.360]  There we go.
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:24.380]  Yeah, they're pretty easy to see.
[02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:25.520]  Yeah, they're pretty noticeable.
[02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.640]  10 coins?
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.900]  I want to interview the person
[02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:31.940]  that made that game type.
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:34.800]  I had one hour.
[02:23:36.620 --> 02:23:38.660]  Alright, Geoff, just don't roll a 1.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.060]  I didn't.
[02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:42.980]  Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and grab
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:43.760]  another star.
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:45.160]  I would've put me tied with Andrew,
[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:46.220]  but he stole yours.
[02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:48.760]  Might come down to the bonus stars.
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:52.660]  Alright, there's my fourth.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.740]  Maybe it'll hand out six bonus stars.
[02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:55.760]  It's time for the bullshit.
[02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:00.580]  I do want to paint a beautiful rainbow.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:02.260]  Here we go.
[02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:05.040]  Oh, wait, we have another mini-game.
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:05.780]  Oh, one more mini-game.
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:09.380]  And you get money.
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:10.740]  I'd like that, thank you.
[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:13.080]  God damn it.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:14.620]  Oh my god.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.160]  I just...
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.560]  Oh, it's knock block.
[02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:21.740]  Cock knocker.
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:24.780]  Oh god, this thing.
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.920]  We got this, Geoff.
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.180]  Jump and attack.
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:31.160]  Remember, if you hit the thwomp...
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:32.420]  He's gotta adjust the timing.
[02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:39.310]  Yeah, I get it.
[02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:41.070]  Yeah, it's rough.
[02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:42.430]  It's real rough.
[02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:49.010]  There's another one.
[02:24:49.310 --> 02:24:51.070]  Paid five on my way out.
[02:24:51.090 --> 02:24:51.830]  To end the game.
[02:24:57.150 --> 02:24:58.870]  Oh, Shy Guy says at the end.
[02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:02.490]  High octane shit here.
[02:25:05.850 --> 02:25:07.850]  Everybody just close your eyes and do it.
[02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:10.010]  I need my eyes for this one.
[02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:15.150]  For a second, my brain thought that was a practice round.
[02:25:15.250 --> 02:25:15.990]  I didn't need to do it.
[02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:22.650]  God, the music.
[02:25:25.890 --> 02:25:27.430]  I'm so glad I can't hear it.
[02:25:29.850 --> 02:25:30.990]  And you're the chorus.
[02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:33.630]  Yeah, I'm so glad I'm doing it to you.
[02:25:35.310 --> 02:25:37.130]  It makes it all the sweeter.
[02:25:42.310 --> 02:25:43.510]  Plungy out here.
[02:25:44.530 --> 02:25:45.690]  We're playing gone.
[02:25:48.510 --> 02:25:49.030]  Oh.
[02:25:49.410 --> 02:25:50.710]  I guess I didn't do it fast enough.
[02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:53.830]  Hey, you're on your way out.
[02:25:54.130 --> 02:25:54.550]  Congratulations.
[02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:55.590]  On your birthday.
[02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:59.810]  Give me those coins.
[02:26:01.450 --> 02:26:02.350]  I can't believe we threw it.
[02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:04.090]  Now it's time for the bullshit.
[02:26:04.890 --> 02:26:06.070]  Here we go.
[02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:07.470]  Stop mashing buttons.
[02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:08.230]  Don't mash.
[02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:12.850]  Take a look at everybody's stars.
[02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:14.490]  Okay.
[02:26:15.210 --> 02:26:17.030]  Yeah, five well-earned stars.
[02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:18.770]  Those used to be yours, Gavin.
[02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:19.730]  Gavin and Nick, man.
[02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:23.530]  If it can't be decided by stars, then we must go to coins.
[02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:25.830]  So let's see how everybody's coins has...
[02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:26.670]  That's not what I said.
[02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:28.890]  Everybody's coins looks like this.
[02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:31.590]  Nick, you're a much better reader.
[02:26:33.330 --> 02:26:33.730]  Oh, thank you.
[02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:37.210]  Before announcing the superstar, I will announce the winners of each award.
[02:26:37.370 --> 02:26:39.910]  These winners will each receive bonus points.
[02:26:40.650 --> 02:26:41.550]  What do you mean, points?
[02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:42.190]  The Game Star.
[02:26:42.450 --> 02:26:44.990]  This award goes to the player who collected the most coins in many games.
[02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.730]  Not Geoff.
[02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.950]  Yeah.
[02:26:49.290 --> 02:26:51.390]  Great. Rich get richer.
[02:26:52.130 --> 02:26:52.330]  Yeah.
[02:26:52.430 --> 02:26:54.090]  I'm the birthday boy.
[02:26:55.650 --> 02:26:57.150]  Hey, it's not that you earned.
[02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:58.530]  Next is the Coin Star.
[02:26:58.630 --> 02:27:01.110]  This award goes to the player who collected the most coins throughout the game.
[02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:02.470]  It goes to DK.
[02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:04.930]  I'm the birthday boy.
[02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:06.610]  For God's sake.
[02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.870]  For shit.
[02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:11.390]  Last is the Happening Star.
[02:27:11.530 --> 02:27:14.150]  This award goes to the player who landed on the most question mark spaces.
[02:27:14.430 --> 02:27:15.710]  The Happening Star goes to Nick.
[02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:19.230]  Geoff's the most happening guy.
[02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:20.170]  That's right.
[02:27:20.690 --> 02:27:21.630]  That's happening to shit.
[02:27:23.350 --> 02:27:24.670]  Oh, who's gonna win?
[02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:25.470]  Don't even.
[02:27:25.890 --> 02:27:27.230]  Who is the superstar?
[02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:31.050]  The birthday boy.
[02:27:34.290 --> 02:27:35.250]  That was a lot of fun, guys.
[02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:35.990]  Thank you.
[02:27:36.930 --> 02:27:41.650]  Oh, congrats to me.
[02:27:42.510 --> 02:27:44.650]  Look at my stars.
[02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:47.190]  Oh, it's the superstar.
[02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:50.690]  Oh, I made that.
[02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:51.590]  Look at that rainbow.
[02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:53.450]  Good job.
[02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:55.130]  Congratulations, man.
[02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:58.990]  Everyone loves the birthday boy.
[02:27:59.530 --> 02:28:01.250]  What a great...
[02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:03.210]  Oh, I made the rainbow road.
[02:28:03.210 --> 02:28:04.970]  I did that.
[02:28:05.170 --> 02:28:06.090]  That was beautiful.
[02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:07.130]  Thanks.
[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:08.270]  What happened?
[02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:10.530]  I don't know.
[02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:16.870]  Geoff doesn't get to cross the rainbow road.
[02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:19.210]  Oh, neither does Mario.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:20.990]  Bye, Mario.
[02:28:21.570 --> 02:28:22.710]  Did I die?
[02:28:23.310 --> 02:28:24.530]  Nick died.
[02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:26.050]  What?
[02:28:26.890 --> 02:28:28.110]  Why are you getting taken?
[02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:31.650]  What was that about?
[02:28:31.650 --> 02:28:33.290]  Am I being murdered?
[02:28:34.370 --> 02:28:35.670]  Geoff's joining.
[02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:38.910]  He can't get rid of me.
[02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:43.610]  Connection strength may vary.
[02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:47.210]  Yeah, real bad.
[02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:48.550]  Real variation.
[02:28:49.290 --> 02:28:49.610]  I'm back.
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.350]  Happy 30th birthday.
[02:28:53.770 --> 02:28:56.110]  Happy 30th birthday, Andrew.
[02:28:58.690 --> 02:28:59.850]  Wow, pre-rendered.
[02:28:59.850 --> 02:29:00.410]  Look at that.
[02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:03.170]  Congratulations to second place.
[02:29:03.290 --> 02:29:05.330]  Five stars, that's nothing to laugh at.
[02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:07.410]  Good job, Luigi, whoever that was.
[02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:09.470]  The other two, better luck next time.
[02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:11.110]  Detailed results.
[02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:12.710]  Did someone press detailed results?
[02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.370]  No.
[02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:16.270]  Who pressed something there?
[02:29:17.130 --> 02:29:18.130]  I don't even have it in my hands.
[02:29:18.610 --> 02:29:19.990]  I put mine down.
[02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:22.570]  It's gotta be Andrew.
[02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:24.250]  I said I put it on my desk.
[02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.850]  Mine's also on my desk.
[02:29:25.850 --> 02:29:26.690]  Mine's also on my desk.
[02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:28.610]  Gavin, what'd you do?
[02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:31.530]  I was waiting to press start.
[02:29:32.650 --> 02:29:33.970]  Mario Party, there's a start.
[02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:40.890]  What a win.
[02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:41.630]  Thanks for watching.
[02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:42.910]  Wait, hold on.
[02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:50.350]  Gonna live back to turn 35?
[02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:54.250]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:29:54.250 --> 02:29:55.750]  You're watching Mario Party Europe.
[02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:58.330]  Turn 35, we're just gonna see who wins.
[02:29:58.410 --> 02:29:59.330]  Almost done.
[02:29:59.510 --> 02:30:01.250]  Getting real close.
[02:30:01.470 --> 02:30:02.530]  It's Andrew's birthday.
[02:30:03.350 --> 02:30:04.610]  Anyone can win.
[02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:06.090]  It's anyone's game.
[02:30:07.290 --> 02:30:08.950]  Thank you so much.
[02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:11.610]  Thank you for coming to our stream of this.
[02:30:12.250 --> 02:30:14.590]  I hope you had fun, I certainly did.
[02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:15.370]  Who are we raiding?
[02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:18.650]  Thanks so much for the donations and hype trains.
[02:30:18.850 --> 02:30:20.030]  Let's raid Larry.
[02:30:21.430 --> 02:30:22.810]  Let's go see what Larry's up to.
[02:30:22.810 --> 02:30:23.290]  Yeah, raid Larry.
[02:30:24.290 --> 02:30:24.710]  Say it.
[02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:27.030]  One word, it me Larry.
[02:30:27.430 --> 02:30:27.970]  No spaces.
[02:30:29.550 --> 02:30:30.870]  Go raid him.
[02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:33.170]  Alright, I'll raid him.
[02:30:33.250 --> 02:30:34.050]  Thanks for watching, everybody.
[02:30:34.170 --> 02:30:37.510]  Have a fantastic rest of your day.
[02:30:38.130 --> 02:30:39.450]  Happiest birthday, Andrew.
[02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:40.610]  Happy birthday, buddy.
[02:30:40.850 --> 02:30:41.590]  Thanks, Nick.
[02:30:43.010 --> 02:30:43.930]  Love you guys.
[02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:45.070]  Bye!
