[00:00.780 --> 00:07.160]  Oh, we are live on Twitch! I hope you saw the social post bringing you here.
[00:07.320 --> 00:14.880]  How is everyone doing? It's Pico Park 2. We're jumping around. I'm saying okay.
[00:15.560 --> 00:16.800]  Are we even live?
[00:18.020 --> 00:18.600]  We're live!
[00:19.120 --> 00:19.500]  Sorry.
[00:20.700 --> 00:22.960]  Are we live? Did people hear that?
[00:24.400 --> 00:27.740]  Gavin, are you asking if we're live or are you saying that we're live?
[00:27.740 --> 00:27.940]  Yeah.
[00:28.620 --> 00:31.960]  No, I was asking because I kept refreshing the page and it said we were offline.
[00:32.540 --> 00:34.340]  Are we online now?
[00:35.560 --> 00:40.680]  We sure are! Unnecessary chaos being created, but that's our brand.
[00:40.980 --> 00:44.100]  Who's ready to go to the Pico Park a second time?
[00:44.280 --> 00:46.540]  Hang on, let me see. I'll find my answer in the game.
[00:46.540 --> 00:47.500]  Someone says you're online.
[00:48.640 --> 00:50.320]  Rebecca says let's go!
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.740]  Oh, cool. Geoffrey the cat title. Here we go.
[00:53.860 --> 00:55.960]  Alright, you guys ready? We're gonna start the game.
[00:55.960 --> 00:58.800]  Oh, hey, do we want to talk about who's what color?
[00:59.140 --> 01:02.760]  Should I cut and then re-record so that we can sync?
[01:04.120 --> 01:04.440]  No.
[01:04.780 --> 01:06.000]  Do you know what that does?
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.040]  Yeah, it's like a ritual.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.240]  Starting game.
[01:09.540 --> 01:11.600]  Well, our names are on the screen, so we don't need to do that other thing.
[01:11.920 --> 01:14.380]  But there's a lot of piss rats happening in the chat.
[01:14.660 --> 01:17.200]  Well, the cats are actually superior, so it's fine.
[01:17.260 --> 01:20.880]  Here we go. Level 1, Pico Park 2. Let's go.
[01:21.240 --> 01:22.120]  Oh, God.
[01:24.440 --> 01:26.340]  Orange, all the way in the back. Geoff, anytime.
[01:26.540 --> 01:27.800]  Oh, sorry, I was looking at my feet.
[01:28.140 --> 01:29.800]  Oh, cool, dude. That's pretty awesome.
[01:30.440 --> 01:33.980]  Well, I know, because I had a cord. I was touching a cord. I wanted to make sure I wasn't about to unplug something.
[01:34.940 --> 01:35.340]  You know what I mean?
[01:36.220 --> 01:39.920]  I feel like there should be a way to use these. These very much look like trampolines.
[01:40.340 --> 01:40.560]  Yes.
[01:41.340 --> 01:42.740]  Tramampoline. Tramampoline.
[01:43.260 --> 01:45.220]  How would we do it?
[01:45.840 --> 01:47.360]  Just stack. Let's just stack up.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.120]  Yeah, let's just stack.
[01:48.320 --> 01:49.820]  And see if somebody can get up there and do something.
[01:50.640 --> 01:52.140]  Good job, Blue.
[01:52.140 --> 01:53.920]  Ah, shit. I'm in people prison.
[01:55.620 --> 01:57.800]  Looking for a place to go.
[01:58.200 --> 01:59.820]  Alright, and then if I go...
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.380]  You guys, there you go.
[02:01.780 --> 02:02.300]  Yeah, there we go.
[02:03.440 --> 02:04.860]  Well, you went too far, Blue.
[02:05.140 --> 02:05.240]  Gavin!
[02:06.980 --> 02:08.100]  What the fuck, Blue?
[02:09.180 --> 02:11.140]  It's the first level.
[02:12.220 --> 02:13.780]  Just don't move. Nobody has to move.
[02:13.780 --> 02:15.960]  So if I'm here, but that doesn't help anyone.
[02:16.140 --> 02:17.160]  No, just keep going.
[02:17.160 --> 02:18.940]  Just see what's up ahead.
[02:18.960 --> 02:22.660]  Probably flip a switch or turn the tramampolines on.
[02:22.680 --> 02:22.960]  There it is.
[02:24.240 --> 02:25.320]  The tramampolines!
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.120]  Boing me.
[02:27.960 --> 02:28.500]  Awesome.
[02:29.680 --> 02:31.540]  Went up here and came back down.
[02:32.020 --> 02:33.500]  There's nothing up here.
[02:33.840 --> 02:34.060]  Hit it.
[02:35.560 --> 02:36.820]  It doesn't work for that one.
[02:37.480 --> 02:38.800]  I'll go get the next one.
[02:39.960 --> 02:41.480]  I'm on my way.
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.000]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[02:47.780 --> 02:48.400]  Thanks, Orange.
[02:48.480 --> 02:48.900]  We all jumped.
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.060]  Let's try that again.
[02:53.600 --> 02:55.460]  We all have to be down here and go.
[02:55.640 --> 02:55.820]  Yep.
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.420]  Okay, I didn't get there fast enough.
[03:00.260 --> 03:00.660]  Run!
[03:00.880 --> 03:01.120]  I'm coming!
[03:04.160 --> 03:04.960]  3, 2, 1, go!
[03:05.260 --> 03:05.560]  Move!
[03:06.640 --> 03:07.740]  Orange, you schmuck!
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.580]  You didn't make it either.
[03:11.900 --> 03:13.300]  Yeah, I backed into you, you fool.
[03:13.820 --> 03:14.160]  No.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.360]  Blue, go left.
[03:16.160 --> 03:16.960]  Hey, what's up, Eric?
[03:19.780 --> 03:20.100]  Okay.
[03:22.140 --> 03:24.760]  I didn't trust it, so I was holding the key and I was waiting.
[03:25.220 --> 03:25.700]  Here I go.
[03:26.760 --> 03:27.880]  Let's clear the way.
[03:29.120 --> 03:30.740]  Make a wall, don't let him in.
[03:34.140 --> 03:34.760]  It's working.
[03:36.060 --> 03:36.300]  Yeah.
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.240]  Now I have the key.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.880]  Now I'm the key master.
[03:40.420 --> 03:41.420]  Now you have the key.
[03:43.780 --> 03:45.560]  Okay, well that's one done.
[03:46.920 --> 03:48.920]  This is going to go great.
[03:53.060 --> 03:56.300]  Thank you for the subs, TheSaltyStick.
[03:59.380 --> 04:00.920]  I'm so happy it's Friday.
[04:02.500 --> 04:04.620]  I haven't streamed with y'all in like a month.
[04:04.700 --> 04:05.280]  I've missed it.
[04:05.840 --> 04:07.500]  I have a question for SaltyStick.
[04:07.580 --> 04:09.020]  How salty is your stick?
[04:09.620 --> 04:10.980]  Oh, fuck. What did I do?
[04:10.980 --> 04:12.320]  Oh, you fell a falling?
[04:12.740 --> 04:13.920]  I mean you died a falling.
[04:13.920 --> 04:15.400]  And we have to reset.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.380]  I don't need to be up there.
[04:19.540 --> 04:19.660]  Okay.
[04:19.820 --> 04:20.020]  Alright.
[04:20.500 --> 04:23.960]  Let me catch it.
[04:24.500 --> 04:24.640]  Okay.
[04:26.340 --> 04:26.740]  Yeah.
[04:30.180 --> 04:31.940]  He ram jammed me right up in there.
[04:32.160 --> 04:33.460]  Yeah, I can't believe Gavin did that.
[04:33.940 --> 04:35.240]  Yeah, it's alright.
[04:35.980 --> 04:37.100]  Alright, let's try this again.
[04:37.740 --> 04:38.200]  Alright, you're fine.
[04:38.720 --> 04:39.500]  Alright, push.
[04:39.740 --> 04:41.420]  Alright, Gavin, don't ram jam.
[04:41.880 --> 04:42.180]  Nice.
[04:43.180 --> 04:44.940]  I'm taking bullets.
[04:45.320 --> 04:45.860]  You're doing great.
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.520]  Hang on.
[04:49.740 --> 04:50.200]  Okay.
[04:50.860 --> 04:53.180]  Gotta stack.
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.340]  Takes three.
[04:57.540 --> 04:59.840]  Are we just trying to move it or are we just trying to climb it?
[05:00.540 --> 05:00.700]  No.
[05:01.200 --> 05:02.120]  God damn it.
[05:02.200 --> 05:05.020]  I thought we would make stairs.
[05:05.020 --> 05:05.740]  Yeah, we could.
[05:06.620 --> 05:07.220]  It's fine.
[05:07.500 --> 05:10.880]  Oh, well.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.300]  Gavin's gotta get back over here.
[05:12.480 --> 05:12.920]  Okay.
[05:14.300 --> 05:15.760]  Now we got it.
[05:17.580 --> 05:18.020]  Easy.
[05:18.420 --> 05:18.820]  Yay!
[05:19.260 --> 05:21.180]  And then you shifted us.
[05:23.320 --> 05:23.640]  God.
[05:23.820 --> 05:25.700]  Hey guys, thanks so much for watching this stream.
[05:25.960 --> 05:26.760]  We really appreciate it.
[05:27.660 --> 05:29.400]  You're really gonna be in for it today.
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.620]  This one might be a long one.
[05:30.620 --> 05:33.180]  We really appreciate everyone who's coming out and watching on Twitch.
[05:34.040 --> 05:34.960]  Supporting our channels.
[05:35.240 --> 05:36.460]  And you can watch this VOD on Tuesday.
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.240]  So you can rewind and say,
[05:38.400 --> 05:39.760]  Hey, who fucked that one up?
[05:39.960 --> 05:41.660]  You'll see clearly on Tuesday.
[05:41.860 --> 05:42.320]  Thanks, bye.
[05:42.840 --> 05:43.400]  Who did it?
[05:43.760 --> 05:46.780]  It seems like we cleared the board.
[05:47.180 --> 05:47.860]  I blame Spummer.
[05:50.380 --> 05:51.780]  We're going into Spum Autumn.
[05:52.040 --> 05:52.320]  Absolutely.
[05:53.400 --> 05:55.180]  Does Spummer ever hang out and chat?
[05:56.260 --> 05:57.440]  I don't know, he's bound to be here, right?
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.560]  I hope he doesn't.
[05:58.700 --> 06:01.920]  And he doesn't know there's an emote with his name on it.
[06:01.980 --> 06:03.840]  He's got no idea what this is.
[06:03.860 --> 06:05.400]  He showed up one time and was like,
[06:05.460 --> 06:06.060]  Eh, it's whatever.
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.000]  He has no idea the mark he made.
[06:08.700 --> 06:10.240]  I only like red versus blue.
[06:11.180 --> 06:11.580]  Whoa!
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.760]  He's like, I'm more of a Michael and Ray fan.
[06:15.860 --> 06:17.560]  There you go, there you go.
[06:17.760 --> 06:18.800]  Keep doing it, keep doing it.
[06:19.540 --> 06:19.940]  Go!
[06:21.300 --> 06:21.960]  Go back!
[06:22.600 --> 06:23.620]  Hit it with all your power.
[06:23.620 --> 06:24.620]  There you go.
[06:24.620 --> 06:25.040]  Boom!
[06:27.500 --> 06:29.060]  Why does it keep pushing us around?
[06:29.400 --> 06:30.440]  They're all slippery.
[06:31.080 --> 06:32.020]  Got it!
[06:32.380 --> 06:34.760]  There you go, let's go.
[06:36.180 --> 06:37.560]  Wow, that level was easy.
[06:38.020 --> 06:38.700]  No biggie.
[06:39.540 --> 06:43.240]  Unless we're babies and little tiny baby people.
[06:45.760 --> 06:46.420]  Zipzeridlilin.
[06:47.080 --> 06:48.820]  Shitload of gifted subs.
[06:48.960 --> 06:49.340]  Get in here.
[06:50.020 --> 06:50.460]  Thank you!
[06:50.460 --> 06:51.560]  Thank you!
[06:52.140 --> 06:54.720]  Spumming all over the chat right now.
[06:58.110 --> 06:58.590]  Bloop.
[06:59.010 --> 07:00.030]  Let's do it, almost done.
[07:00.650 --> 07:02.810]  I wonder how many levels this game is.
[07:03.010 --> 07:05.350]  Yeah, no, it doesn't show.
[07:05.730 --> 07:06.190]  Seven.
[07:06.550 --> 07:07.470]  Well, it's at least four.
[07:09.390 --> 07:11.070]  Oh shit, what is seven?
[07:11.450 --> 07:11.690]  Oh!
[07:12.630 --> 07:13.610]  There's spikes there.
[07:14.030 --> 07:15.930]  No, it's not number of lives, is it?
[07:16.810 --> 07:17.930]  I don't think so.
[07:19.010 --> 07:20.630]  Switches, maybe, that we have to hit?
[07:20.630 --> 07:22.690]  Yeah, I think it may have been buttons.
[07:22.770 --> 07:23.030]  God!
[07:25.810 --> 07:27.410]  I don't see what the number is.
[07:28.030 --> 07:30.790]  You guys, you guys.
[07:30.990 --> 07:31.910]  You can't see it.
[07:32.550 --> 07:33.630]  Right into it.
[07:35.670 --> 07:36.530]  That was me.
[07:37.630 --> 07:38.130]  That was me.
[07:38.930 --> 07:40.270]  No excuses on that one.
[07:40.710 --> 07:41.670]  I feel like it was you last time.
[07:42.070 --> 07:42.590]  No, it wasn't.
[07:42.910 --> 07:44.370]  It was a lot of us last time.
[07:46.750 --> 07:47.150]  Okay.
[07:48.110 --> 07:49.550]  Then we gotta go all the way right?
[07:49.730 --> 07:50.450]  Oh, can you hit that?
[07:52.170 --> 07:52.490]  Whoa.
[07:52.790 --> 07:53.550]  Oh, interesting.
[07:55.650 --> 07:57.370]  Where do I wanna go?
[07:57.830 --> 07:58.930]  Can you go all the way to the left?
[07:59.010 --> 08:00.010]  Go left? Yeah.
[08:01.410 --> 08:02.430]  Alright, I got that one.
[08:03.270 --> 08:04.370]  Hey, purple, come down here.
[08:04.870 --> 08:05.390]  Oh, shit.
[08:06.710 --> 08:07.490]  Alright, there you go.
[08:07.670 --> 08:09.310]  And blue or...
[08:10.990 --> 08:13.310]  Yeah, you gotta stay on him.
[08:13.670 --> 08:15.070]  Okay, so I gotta hit this bottom one?
[08:15.070 --> 08:17.210]  Yeah, and I think we're good.
[08:18.050 --> 08:19.230]  Hey, way to go, boys.
[08:20.170 --> 08:21.550]  Look at us, big boys.
[08:21.870 --> 08:22.070]  I'm trapped.
[08:22.450 --> 08:24.150]  Red, hit yours.
[08:25.270 --> 08:26.490]  There you go. Oh, thank you.
[08:27.530 --> 08:27.970]  Bye.
[08:29.150 --> 08:29.930]  Please don't die.
[08:30.890 --> 08:33.190]  Oh, that would suck.
[08:33.350 --> 08:34.550]  No! You're fine.
[08:35.390 --> 08:36.150]  Yeah, thanks, man.
[08:37.490 --> 08:38.370]  Appreciate it.
[08:39.950 --> 08:41.010]  What the fuck?
[08:42.310 --> 08:44.570]  Gavin, stop trying to touch me in this dark room.
[08:46.330 --> 08:47.650]  How did you see?
[08:48.090 --> 08:49.290]  The world is clear!
[08:49.610 --> 08:52.730]  That's the world record speed run for Pico Park 2.
[08:52.970 --> 08:53.610]  Hell yeah.
[08:53.630 --> 08:54.510]  We're all done with the game.
[08:54.710 --> 08:55.430]  Oh, there's more?
[08:56.010 --> 08:58.690]  Oh, that one is like...
[08:58.690 --> 08:59.430]  string.
[09:01.210 --> 09:02.330]  No, it's like the other game.
[09:02.330 --> 09:03.970]  This is where we do our best.
[09:04.150 --> 09:06.070]  It's like the other game. No.
[09:07.310 --> 09:08.450]  Oh, wow, what tipped you off?
[09:10.410 --> 09:10.890]  Yeah!
[09:10.890 --> 09:11.630]  No!
[09:13.710 --> 09:14.430]  Oh, yeah.
[09:14.730 --> 09:15.450]  Hey, guys.
[09:16.590 --> 09:17.170]  You guys killed me.
[09:17.870 --> 09:19.310]  Stay in line, fella.
[09:20.250 --> 09:23.090]  If you had to guess which one of us
[09:23.090 --> 09:24.810]  in regulation makes the best
[09:24.810 --> 09:26.330]  mashed potatoes, who would you guess?
[09:28.090 --> 09:28.570]  Me.
[09:28.850 --> 09:31.010]  I'd like to throw myself into the ring
[09:31.010 --> 09:31.770]  for consideration.
[09:32.710 --> 09:33.310]  Get off me.
[09:33.970 --> 09:35.770]  Oh, you did that to me.
[09:35.770 --> 09:35.930]  Who?
[09:38.610 --> 09:39.770]  Geoff just pointing
[09:39.770 --> 09:41.630]  fingers, but not at anyone in particular.
[09:43.070 --> 09:43.670]  You could
[09:43.670 --> 09:45.890]  jump on it. You don't have to get killed by it.
[09:45.930 --> 09:46.630]  No, I was...
[09:46.630 --> 09:49.170]  I thought I was Nick for a second.
[09:49.510 --> 09:50.350]  I'm at the end.
[09:51.910 --> 09:53.490]  I mean, Nick can jump on it, too.
[09:54.350 --> 09:55.230]  That's true. I did.
[09:55.350 --> 09:56.370]  There you go.
[09:57.970 --> 09:59.070]  Gotta make a bridge.
[09:59.430 --> 10:01.290]  Gotta make a bridge. Yep, bridge.
[10:03.450 --> 10:04.710]  You wanna keep going, Red?
[10:04.930 --> 10:05.710]  Just a little bit further.
[10:07.470 --> 10:07.870]  Thanks.
[10:08.450 --> 10:09.050]  Thanks, Purple.
[10:09.870 --> 10:11.230]  Alright, Purple, why don't you start the bridge?
[10:11.470 --> 10:12.130]  Alright, Purple, me.
[10:13.510 --> 10:14.530]  I? What?
[10:15.210 --> 10:16.310]  There's an order?
[10:16.770 --> 10:18.070]  Like, we're in a line.
[10:18.950 --> 10:20.410]  Let me get to the end.
[10:22.570 --> 10:23.370]  Nightmare memories.
[10:23.530 --> 10:24.210]  Alright, then Orange.
[10:25.310 --> 10:26.370]  I'm the funny one, Griff.
[10:26.410 --> 10:27.230]  Oh, I went too far.
[10:27.230 --> 10:28.610]  Wait, wait.
[10:28.790 --> 10:30.470]  There's one person over there.
[10:31.130 --> 10:32.330]  Move, Blue!
[10:33.130 --> 10:34.150]  I'm on your head.
[10:35.690 --> 10:37.150]  Alright, now Orange.
[10:37.410 --> 10:38.150]  Now Green.
[10:38.870 --> 10:41.030]  Okay, alright.
[10:42.390 --> 10:43.190]  There you go.
[10:45.170 --> 10:45.810]  Yay!
[10:46.690 --> 10:47.710]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10:48.110 --> 10:50.510]  I'll jump to the other side.
[10:50.930 --> 10:51.490]  Get up at it.
[10:53.030 --> 10:54.130]  I'll jump to the other side.
[10:54.130 --> 10:54.710]  I'll hold him.
[10:55.050 --> 10:56.810]  I did not have it.
[10:57.470 --> 10:59.010]  Keep going back, Red.
[10:59.430 --> 11:00.370]  Blue's gotta help.
[11:01.330 --> 11:01.670]  Alright.
[11:04.370 --> 11:05.930]  Stay close to me, would you?
[11:06.070 --> 11:06.550]  Yeah, I gotcha.
[11:06.990 --> 11:08.370]  Gavin's gonna kill us, but alright.
[11:09.290 --> 11:10.310]  We got the key.
[11:11.850 --> 11:14.490]  He made it happen.
[11:14.590 --> 11:14.930]  Okay, you ready?
[11:15.910 --> 11:17.510]  Why do people keep walking off?
[11:18.310 --> 11:18.490]  Why?
[11:19.450 --> 11:20.970]  That's you asking that?
[11:21.590 --> 11:23.410]  Well, I thought we were going all the way over.
[11:23.970 --> 11:25.250]  Yeah, come all the way over.
[11:25.510 --> 11:26.250]  Alright, let's go.
[11:27.270 --> 11:28.990]  Gavin, you were...
[11:28.990 --> 11:30.910]  I got you, guys!
[11:31.190 --> 11:31.870]  You better keep playing.
[11:33.090 --> 11:33.590]  Jump, Green!
[11:34.150 --> 11:35.030]  Jump, Green!
[11:37.510 --> 11:37.970]  Goal!
[11:39.010 --> 11:39.930]  What happened?
[11:40.650 --> 11:43.050]  It wasn't as consequential as I thought it was gonna be.
[11:46.950 --> 11:48.110]  I'm not even moving.
[11:48.110 --> 11:49.630]  I'm not even touching my controller.
[11:49.650 --> 11:50.610]  What's happening to me?
[11:50.930 --> 11:52.430]  I'm getting shished around.
[11:54.130 --> 11:54.530]  Why?
[11:56.570 --> 11:57.370]  Alright, let's take a break.
[11:58.550 --> 11:59.350]  Let's reorder.
[11:59.370 --> 12:02.030]  Get to the other side, and then we'll drip off the back.
[12:02.410 --> 12:03.690]  Don't worry about the key first.
[12:04.490 --> 12:05.290]  Let's regroup.
[12:05.510 --> 12:06.290]  Should we just jump?
[12:06.470 --> 12:08.430]  What if I just ran and jumped to the other side?
[12:09.710 --> 12:10.830]  Are you an end?
[12:11.130 --> 12:13.610]  Yeah, and then you guys could come with me.
[12:17.110 --> 12:18.550]  Alright, you jump, and I'll run off.
[12:18.550 --> 12:20.250]  I can't jump if you're on top of me!
[12:22.430 --> 12:23.270]  Oh, perfect!
[12:25.210 --> 12:26.150]  Alright, make the bridge.
[12:26.270 --> 12:28.010]  Maybe we can anchor it, Eric.
[12:29.670 --> 12:31.330]  I'm letting them tire themselves out,
[12:31.450 --> 12:32.110]  and then we can actually...
[12:32.110 --> 12:34.590]  Can I take the lead again?
[12:34.870 --> 12:35.470]  Yeah, please!
[12:35.830 --> 12:36.490]  I'm begging you.
[12:36.630 --> 12:39.090]  But you, and then sometimes also Gavin.
[12:40.050 --> 12:40.250]  Yeah.
[12:41.010 --> 12:41.830]  Well, I'm just getting on.
[12:44.470 --> 12:46.090]  What are you doing, green?
[12:47.690 --> 12:48.570]  I'm trying.
[12:49.170 --> 12:51.570]  I'm trying to get next to you.
[12:51.890 --> 12:52.710]  What do you want?
[12:53.030 --> 12:53.290]  Go!
[12:53.490 --> 12:55.570]  Go, go, go, go!
[12:55.710 --> 12:57.670]  I don't know how we did it.
[12:58.130 --> 12:58.970]  That was an accident.
[13:00.230 --> 13:01.430]  Get over!
[13:02.010 --> 13:03.490]  Talk about failing forward.
[13:03.690 --> 13:04.410]  Jesus Christ.
[13:04.550 --> 13:06.910]  Alright, we got a stack again.
[13:07.030 --> 13:07.830]  So let's reorder.
[13:09.430 --> 13:11.170]  Just green, jump on orange.
[13:11.170 --> 13:13.630]  The game doesn't care, just...
[13:14.830 --> 13:15.510]  There we go.
[13:16.590 --> 13:16.990]  Okay.
[13:18.170 --> 13:19.810]  I think two of us are going to have to go up there.
[13:20.170 --> 13:21.490]  I think it's going to be one of us.
[13:22.370 --> 13:22.770]  Okay.
[13:25.050 --> 13:26.190]  Hang on, the game doesn't care.
[13:27.750 --> 13:28.190]  There you go.
[13:28.330 --> 13:29.410]  You and I made it.
[13:29.710 --> 13:30.070]  There we go.
[13:34.210 --> 13:35.430]  Alright, credit to team.
[13:35.570 --> 13:36.810]  Three more levels of that!
[13:37.130 --> 13:37.570]  That's fine.
[13:37.570 --> 13:39.130]  Good job, team.
[13:39.970 --> 13:41.030]  Good teamwork.
[13:41.530 --> 13:43.970]  I think we're having so much success today.
[13:44.070 --> 13:46.150]  Maybe we don't even care when it's 5-0-1.
[13:47.150 --> 13:47.710]  Woah!
[13:48.350 --> 13:49.330]  Don't touch me!
[13:50.410 --> 13:51.170]  That's fine.
[13:51.250 --> 13:52.150]  We're starting over.
[13:53.490 --> 13:54.870]  We've got lethal heads.
[13:55.950 --> 13:57.510]  Thank God I'm in the back.
[13:59.430 --> 14:00.590]  Don't touch me, blue.
[14:02.270 --> 14:03.370]  Who's braving it?
[14:03.950 --> 14:05.490]  Okay, that's nice.
[14:05.490 --> 14:07.430]  Red, you go.
[14:07.770 --> 14:08.030]  And I'll go.
[14:08.390 --> 14:10.790]  We need two people to go on that now.
[14:11.170 --> 14:12.770]  Somebody has to come back.
[14:12.870 --> 14:14.110]  I'll wait down.
[14:15.290 --> 14:16.730]  Why did you do that?
[14:16.990 --> 14:18.250]  What was that?
[14:20.250 --> 14:21.630]  Purple would go.
[14:21.990 --> 14:23.910]  Now blue...
[14:23.910 --> 14:24.170]  Ow!
[14:25.590 --> 14:26.930]  You both have to go at the same time.
[14:27.190 --> 14:28.030]  Gavin, ready?
[14:28.290 --> 14:28.670]  Gavin!
[14:30.290 --> 14:31.850]  Nick will do it.
[14:31.850 --> 14:34.210]  I think Nick has done all the damage
[14:34.210 --> 14:34.890]  this whole time.
[14:35.890 --> 14:36.930]  Yes, however...
[14:38.410 --> 14:39.830]  So purple did
[14:39.830 --> 14:41.370]  100% damage.
[14:42.050 --> 14:44.190]  No, orange hit me on that last one.
[14:44.470 --> 14:45.930]  So red and purple
[14:45.930 --> 14:47.690]  go together. Red jumps out.
[14:47.770 --> 14:48.530]  One of us comes back.
[14:49.490 --> 14:51.670]  We did it right the first time.
[14:51.950 --> 14:52.430]  There you go.
[14:55.590 --> 14:56.570]  I'll come back.
[14:57.430 --> 14:58.410]  I'll get on.
[14:58.410 --> 15:00.110]  What are you doing, Nick?
[15:00.110 --> 15:01.270]  You jump off, Gav.
[15:02.350 --> 15:03.010]  That's it.
[15:03.290 --> 15:05.770]  Just clear the fuck out of the way.
[15:05.970 --> 15:06.650]  Ready, Geoff?
[15:08.850 --> 15:09.290]  Geoff!
[15:10.290 --> 15:10.730]  Stop!
[15:13.730 --> 15:15.810]  We need to hit our spots.
[15:16.030 --> 15:17.710]  I'm sorry. That's tough.
[15:18.510 --> 15:19.410]  But they were fucked up anyway.
[15:20.450 --> 15:22.310]  You guys are going to have to be better about that.
[15:25.150 --> 15:25.670]  Alright.
[15:26.550 --> 15:27.270]  You ready?
[15:27.710 --> 15:28.630]  You and me, Geoff.
[15:29.510 --> 15:30.010]  Yeah.
[15:30.870 --> 15:32.030]  You didn't come last time.
[15:32.290 --> 15:34.210]  I have to stay for green.
[15:34.570 --> 15:36.990]  What are you talking about, Gavin?
[15:38.230 --> 15:39.470]  Do you understand
[15:39.470 --> 15:40.210]  what we're doing?
[15:42.030 --> 15:42.550]  No.
[15:43.070 --> 15:44.690]  I'm sorry. I thought I'd slide.
[15:45.210 --> 15:46.150]  I didn't slide.
[15:47.630 --> 15:48.710]  I don't know why I didn't.
[15:48.990 --> 15:51.050]  You're coming with me, Geoff.
[15:51.050 --> 15:51.690]  What?
[15:53.210 --> 15:53.750]  Red.
[15:54.970 --> 15:55.610]  You got it.
[15:55.810 --> 15:57.030]  Everyone move to the right.
[15:57.470 --> 15:59.830]  Keep moving.
[16:01.610 --> 16:02.550]  There we go.
[16:02.750 --> 16:02.950]  Sorry.
[16:05.330 --> 16:05.870]  Blue.
[16:06.510 --> 16:06.530]  Gavin.
[16:07.330 --> 16:08.290]  You little menace.
[16:15.370 --> 16:17.090]  I'm never going to stop thinking about
[16:17.090 --> 16:18.670]  Alright, Geoff. Now you come with me.
[16:18.670 --> 16:21.370]  What are you talking about?
[16:22.450 --> 16:24.670]  I thought there were more of you back there.
[16:26.030 --> 16:26.770]  Oh, shit.
[16:26.870 --> 16:28.830]  I appreciate you wanting to include me.
[16:29.010 --> 16:29.130]  What?
[16:30.850 --> 16:31.350]  Wait.
[16:33.430 --> 16:34.930]  This actually is good.
[16:35.570 --> 16:35.790]  Okay.
[16:36.530 --> 16:37.490]  Blue and red, go.
[16:38.350 --> 16:39.490]  Oh, yeah. Jump.
[16:39.910 --> 16:40.830]  Hit jump button.
[16:41.870 --> 16:42.550]  I'm jumping.
[16:43.590 --> 16:44.710]  Look at that.
[16:45.530 --> 16:46.590]  Oh, what the?
[16:47.730 --> 16:49.130]  Have some hangers.
[16:49.410 --> 16:50.970]  Have some hangers down there.
[16:51.090 --> 16:53.550]  Okay, me and Geoff are going to hang down.
[16:53.810 --> 16:53.970]  Okay?
[16:54.250 --> 16:55.710]  And then you guys start moving right.
[16:57.470 --> 16:57.710]  What?
[16:59.770 --> 17:01.170]  Okay, wait.
[17:04.950 --> 17:05.670]  Just one.
[17:07.130 --> 17:08.470]  Okay, okay.
[17:08.530 --> 17:10.310]  Geoff, you're the only one that goes.
[17:10.550 --> 17:11.730]  Geoff, you're the only one that goes.
[17:11.730 --> 17:13.030]  Okay, now everyone else move right.
[17:13.270 --> 17:14.270]  Wait, wait, wait.
[17:14.510 --> 17:17.270]  What if green...
[17:17.270 --> 17:18.310]  Gavin is on my head.
[17:18.390 --> 17:21.910]  I think green needs to climb.
[17:22.430 --> 17:23.810]  I think green's got to climb purple.
[17:24.210 --> 17:24.690]  Yep, yep.
[17:25.750 --> 17:27.990]  Alright, yeah. Let me get right on that.
[17:28.190 --> 17:29.470]  Like, what do you mean?
[17:30.090 --> 17:31.390]  Yeah, maybe...
[17:32.190 --> 17:32.930]  Let's reset.
[17:33.230 --> 17:34.590]  Maybe we do that before we drop.
[17:35.030 --> 17:36.310]  Wait, wait, wait.
[17:37.650 --> 17:39.050]  What do you want to do?
[17:39.050 --> 17:40.970]  I just want to see...
[17:40.970 --> 17:43.770]  If it's one button or if it's hitting two.
[17:44.170 --> 17:45.870]  Like, is it any of the buttons there?
[17:45.990 --> 17:46.990]  I think it's any of the buttons.
[17:47.230 --> 17:48.790]  Okay, so...
[17:48.790 --> 17:51.570]  I think green gets on top of purple.
[17:51.890 --> 17:52.750]  To the right, Gavin.
[17:53.870 --> 17:55.010]  I just don't like...
[17:55.010 --> 17:57.270]  Like, Gavin, are you green?
[17:58.170 --> 17:59.470]  Go forward a little bit.
[17:59.970 --> 18:00.490]  Purple.
[18:01.190 --> 18:01.710]  No!
[18:03.150 --> 18:03.850]  The other right.
[18:04.170 --> 18:04.690]  Thank you.
[18:04.690 --> 18:05.110]  Alright.
[18:06.570 --> 18:07.950]  Just go off.
[18:08.510 --> 18:09.010]  Go off.
[18:12.800 --> 18:13.640]  There we go.
[18:13.940 --> 18:15.980]  He wants to restart. He wants to refresh.
[18:16.180 --> 18:16.340]  Okay.
[18:18.160 --> 18:18.720]  Alright.
[18:20.360 --> 18:22.500]  Green, just stay glued to purple.
[18:22.700 --> 18:23.300]  I'm trying to.
[18:23.460 --> 18:25.380]  Yeah, I know.
[18:25.600 --> 18:26.160]  Alright.
[18:28.940 --> 18:29.880]  Swing me back.
[18:30.300 --> 18:30.760]  Nice.
[18:32.220 --> 18:33.940]  There we go.
[18:33.940 --> 18:34.640]  Hell yeah!
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.120]  Alright, you're gonna have to keep...
[18:37.120 --> 18:39.480]  I'm trapped. Can you go up?
[18:40.240 --> 18:40.760]  Oh.
[18:41.440 --> 18:43.000]  I can't climb this?
[18:43.740 --> 18:44.960]  There you go.
[18:46.180 --> 18:47.160]  Yeah, alright. There we go.
[18:47.620 --> 18:48.260]  Perfect!
[18:48.920 --> 18:50.040]  Great work!
[18:50.700 --> 18:52.900]  God, that was easy.
[18:53.260 --> 18:55.180]  Like I was standing there doing nothing.
[18:55.740 --> 18:56.740]  Like I wasn't...
[18:56.740 --> 18:59.960]  It kind of appeared that way.
[18:59.960 --> 19:01.120]  Struggling? What does that mean?
[19:01.120 --> 19:02.560]  What does that mean?
[19:04.760 --> 19:05.620]  Here's the thing.
[19:05.940 --> 19:07.780]  When one person says something like that...
[19:07.780 --> 19:08.700]  Don't touch me!
[19:09.220 --> 19:11.060]  It's like none of it's gonna help us.
[19:11.340 --> 19:11.660]  That's true.
[19:12.800 --> 19:13.720]  I turn back and we're all dead.
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.980]  Hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Everyone stop.
[19:17.180 --> 19:18.500]  Blue has to move this thing.
[19:20.020 --> 19:20.460]  Yeah.
[19:21.980 --> 19:22.420]  Green's...
[19:23.220 --> 19:24.400]  That's the only way I could've gone.
[19:25.120 --> 19:26.220]  That's the only way I could've gone.
[19:26.780 --> 19:28.520]  Purple, purple, clear out.
[19:28.520 --> 19:29.200]  Blue!
[19:30.440 --> 19:32.000]  What are you doing?
[19:32.940 --> 19:33.980]  Wait, hang on.
[19:34.260 --> 19:35.540]  Don't die yet.
[19:35.740 --> 19:37.160]  What are you doing?
[19:37.780 --> 19:39.500]  I could go wherever I want.
[19:39.620 --> 19:41.960]  What could you do?
[19:46.460 --> 19:48.080]  You're killing me!
[19:49.660 --> 19:51.860]  Do whatever you want now.
[19:53.220 --> 19:53.860]  Alright.
[19:54.420 --> 19:54.660]  Red!
[19:54.660 --> 19:56.460]  Okay, Gavin's just...
[19:56.460 --> 19:57.080]  Gavin.
[19:58.760 --> 20:00.040]  Kick the shit out of me.
[20:00.780 --> 20:01.260]  Nice!
[20:01.960 --> 20:04.460]  Well, hold on.
[20:04.540 --> 20:06.500]  He's supposed to jump up and behind him.
[20:06.760 --> 20:08.800]  Nick is fucking useless sometimes.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.640]  I'm telling you.
[20:11.920 --> 20:13.100]  You need to...
[20:13.100 --> 20:14.380]  Look, here's what happens.
[20:14.620 --> 20:16.720]  Gavin! For fuck's sake!
[20:16.820 --> 20:18.040]  Now we do this.
[20:18.100 --> 20:19.500]  This is what I was waiting to do.
[20:19.500 --> 20:20.600]  You did it!
[20:23.380 --> 20:26.020]  Now, what is getting in the way doing for us?
[20:27.300 --> 20:28.100]  There you go.
[20:29.760 --> 20:30.680]  I'm purple!
[20:33.520 --> 20:34.100]  Okay.
[20:35.860 --> 20:40.520]  Oh, man.
[20:43.760 --> 20:48.220]  Gavin, you're doing great, dude.
[20:48.960 --> 20:50.060]  Don't kick the workman.
[20:52.620 --> 20:53.500]  Hang on.
[20:53.640 --> 20:54.740]  This thing's coming back.
[20:54.960 --> 20:56.820]  I think you have to be down there.
[21:02.200 --> 21:03.760]  Why are you guys...
[21:03.760 --> 21:06.180]  This is the closest we've ever been to each other.
[21:06.340 --> 21:07.540]  And I don't understand why.
[21:10.060 --> 21:11.720]  I don't know. That is a good question.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.040]  Jesus Christ!
[21:15.680 --> 21:17.840]  We're bunched up. Where else are we going to go?
[21:18.240 --> 21:19.240]  We need to see what's up next.
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.420]  Right, but we don't have to be on top of each other to do it.
[21:23.040 --> 21:23.960]  There you go.
[21:24.860 --> 21:25.880]  We just need to...
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.660]  Okay. Red, go down.
[21:29.620 --> 21:30.940]  Boy, this is going to be tough.
[21:33.420 --> 21:34.280]  I'm going to die!
[21:35.760 --> 21:36.480]  No, you're fine.
[21:37.200 --> 21:38.720]  That's good. That's what we want. Get up there.
[21:38.880 --> 21:39.460]  Green, go.
[21:40.280 --> 21:41.560]  Shut the fuck up.
[21:43.220 --> 21:44.660]  I'm going to die.
[21:46.280 --> 21:47.640]  Why didn't you come over here?
[21:47.640 --> 21:48.540]  You got it.
[21:53.040 --> 21:53.880]  Thanks, Andrew.
[21:54.140 --> 21:54.720]  You're welcome.
[21:54.940 --> 21:55.860]  I got it.
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.920]  For a brief moment,
[22:00.020 --> 22:01.020]  I forgot we couldn't touch.
[22:01.260 --> 22:03.200]  I'm going to go just to see what happens.
[22:03.320 --> 22:03.940]  But then I remembered.
[22:04.580 --> 22:05.400]  All five of us.
[22:07.500 --> 22:09.420]  Did you forget again or what happened?
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.020]  I thought you were going to jump. I just mistimed it.
[22:11.880 --> 22:13.260]  Nudge to the left, Gavin!
[22:13.400 --> 22:14.900]  Nudge to the left, Gavin!
[22:14.900 --> 22:16.620]  Piece of shit, Gavin.
[22:16.840 --> 22:17.760]  Son of a bitch.
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.160]  Gavin's like, I'm on here. It should be totally fine.
[22:20.180 --> 22:22.120]  I was going to wait until...
[22:22.120 --> 22:23.540]  It was pushing!
[22:24.340 --> 22:25.380]  Way to go, Red. Thanks.
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.420]  What are you doing?
[22:29.120 --> 22:30.580]  Why are you moving?
[22:31.240 --> 22:32.140]  We just needed a wipe.
[22:32.440 --> 22:33.540]  We needed a reset.
[22:33.620 --> 22:35.120]  Hey, Spummer's here and he's honored.
[22:36.240 --> 22:37.000]  What's up, Spummer?
[22:38.780 --> 22:39.760]  What's up, Spumdog?
[22:40.460 --> 22:42.260]  Also, somebody asked if we're still going to do the idea
[22:42.260 --> 22:43.380]  where Eric and Gavin
[22:44.640 --> 22:45.240]  control... Yes, we are.
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.420]  We talked about it today.
[22:46.860 --> 22:49.520]  We will definitely get there.
[22:49.680 --> 22:50.940]  Hang on, hang on. Wait, wait, wait. Gavin, wait.
[22:52.280 --> 22:53.540]  Oh, okay. No, we're fine.
[22:53.960 --> 22:55.020]  Alright. Yeah, you got it.
[22:55.280 --> 22:58.580]  Me and Andrew are going to go down all the way to as far right as we can go.
[22:59.560 --> 23:00.260]  I'm going down.
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.240]  There you go.
[23:02.080 --> 23:03.620]  Gotta come back for Nick.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.180]  Alright, if Orange wants to go up there
[23:06.180 --> 23:07.480]  and get the key, there you go.
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.860]  You can drop, okay.
[23:09.860 --> 23:10.520]  Yeah, that's good.
[23:10.660 --> 23:12.920]  Or I'll just come down.
[23:13.340 --> 23:13.940]  Yeah, you're good.
[23:14.720 --> 23:16.820]  Why don't we not go on that yet?
[23:18.200 --> 23:20.280]  Okay, when do you want to go on it?
[23:20.980 --> 23:21.200]  Okay.
[23:21.740 --> 23:23.740]  You just have to keep slowly moving left.
[23:25.160 --> 23:26.260]  It's so funny.
[23:27.260 --> 23:28.460]  The slightest tap.
[23:28.660 --> 23:29.400]  The slightest tap.
[23:29.520 --> 23:30.980]  A little bit more. Keep purple!
[23:31.900 --> 23:33.160]  Blue! I'm moving!
[23:33.460 --> 23:33.800]  What the fuck?
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.860]  I was in the middle.
[23:36.860 --> 23:37.300]  There we go!
[23:37.780 --> 23:38.220]  Stop!
[23:41.300 --> 23:42.180]  Move left!
[23:42.900 --> 23:43.580]  Thanks, Gavin.
[23:44.600 --> 23:46.220]  What do you want me to move left for?
[23:46.320 --> 23:47.440]  You can't take it!
[23:47.660 --> 23:49.140]  You will do damage if you take it.
[23:49.660 --> 23:51.580]  I think you can get close enough to take it.
[23:52.260 --> 23:53.640]  Alright, yeah.
[23:54.580 --> 23:54.940]  No.
[23:56.920 --> 23:57.740]  No, I can't.
[23:58.540 --> 24:00.920]  What did you think?
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.140]  Wait, wait, wait.
[24:02.660 --> 24:04.420]  Yeah, go ahead, Gavin.
[24:04.420 --> 24:06.000]  Go ahead, Gavin. What's the plan?
[24:06.140 --> 24:08.380]  I wanted to see how long it takes to die on someone's head.
[24:08.740 --> 24:09.380]  Uh-huh.
[24:09.500 --> 24:10.960]  Five hits.
[24:12.820 --> 24:13.480]  Alright, moving.
[24:14.340 --> 24:14.780]  Now, Eric.
[24:20.080 --> 24:20.340]  Okay.
[24:22.300 --> 24:23.480]  Getting off the thing.
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.780]  We know every part of this.
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.480]  It's so funny.
[24:27.940 --> 24:28.700]  Stop, stop!
[24:30.160 --> 24:31.960]  This is the easy part, guys.
[24:32.220 --> 24:32.800]  I know.
[24:32.800 --> 24:32.820]  I know.
[24:34.620 --> 24:35.800]  Alright, Gavin, a little further.
[24:36.340 --> 24:37.160]  There you go.
[24:39.320 --> 24:40.660]  Red, careful, man.
[24:41.340 --> 24:42.560]  We're good, we're good.
[24:43.380 --> 24:43.720]  It's all good.
[24:44.940 --> 24:46.040]  I'm not moving, dude.
[24:46.260 --> 24:47.960]  I'm not moving.
[24:48.880 --> 24:50.160]  Until you guys move.
[24:51.980 --> 24:52.160]  Okay.
[24:53.340 --> 24:54.600]  Gavin, do you feel confident?
[24:54.980 --> 24:55.620]  Oh, my God.
[24:57.020 --> 24:58.020]  You got it.
[24:58.640 --> 24:59.640]  You're doing great.
[24:59.640 --> 25:01.900]  You're doing great.
[25:01.940 --> 25:03.400]  Green, come on, man.
[25:03.660 --> 25:05.940]  I can't go any further.
[25:06.300 --> 25:07.900]  Look at how much room you have.
[25:07.940 --> 25:08.420]  This is good.
[25:08.440 --> 25:11.600]  This is good.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.880]  Go left, go left, go left.
[25:14.560 --> 25:15.100]  There you go.
[25:15.940 --> 25:16.460]  Easy.
[25:17.100 --> 25:17.540]  Gavin!
[25:20.280 --> 25:21.780]  Guys, thanks so much for watching
[25:21.780 --> 25:22.700]  so far into this.
[25:22.940 --> 25:24.920]  How are you liking it so far?
[25:25.360 --> 25:26.460]  Just getting started.
[25:27.920 --> 25:28.260]  Argh!
[25:29.080 --> 25:30.380]  I don't want to yell at you, Gavin.
[25:30.500 --> 25:31.000]  I'm gonna.
[25:33.400 --> 25:34.080]  World clear!
[25:36.300 --> 25:38.260]  This is low stakes still, alright?
[25:38.700 --> 25:38.840]  Yeah.
[25:41.300 --> 25:41.980]  Don't touch me.
[25:42.140 --> 25:43.580]  Wait, why is this the same one?
[25:44.660 --> 25:45.680]  This is the same one.
[25:46.280 --> 25:47.260]  We don't want to do that again.
[25:47.360 --> 25:49.380]  I thought it took us back. It did not.
[25:51.380 --> 25:51.720]  Formation!
[25:51.720 --> 25:51.940]  We did it!
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.900]  Like a biker club.
[25:56.220 --> 25:57.900]  When did the first pico part come out?
[25:57.980 --> 25:58.200]  I wonder.
[25:59.540 --> 26:00.680]  That kills it.
[26:01.480 --> 26:02.360]  Avoid the light.
[26:04.000 --> 26:04.760]  Got it.
[26:05.580 --> 26:05.920]  Okay.
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.000]  We can touch each other.
[26:08.740 --> 26:09.120]  Shit.
[26:10.820 --> 26:12.140]  Good job, Gavin.
[26:13.080 --> 26:14.640]  I was trying to stop short.
[26:15.140 --> 26:16.440]  It's directly under it.
[26:16.760 --> 26:19.340]  So if you go, I'll follow.
[26:20.080 --> 26:20.880]  I'm locked in.
[26:20.880 --> 26:21.760]  And I'll jump on you.
[26:22.020 --> 26:25.020]  Alright, you two do the same.
[26:28.120 --> 26:29.900]  Well, Andrew still stood there.
[26:30.140 --> 26:30.840]  Yeah, I'm not sure what that was.
[26:30.840 --> 26:31.920]  You could've jumped on me.
[26:33.540 --> 26:34.680]  We're going two at a time here.
[26:35.460 --> 26:36.760]  Geoff, why don't you stand on my head?
[26:38.160 --> 26:39.420]  Oh, that's not a bad idea.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.520]  I'll do the walking.
[26:41.520 --> 26:42.900]  Either way, Andrew. Right in the middle.
[26:43.260 --> 26:43.920]  We're dead here.
[26:47.400 --> 26:48.420]  Why did you stop?
[26:48.540 --> 26:50.540]  I'm going to stand on your head again.
[26:50.880 --> 26:51.700]  I'll follow you.
[26:51.920 --> 26:53.740]  We could also just stand on one person's head.
[26:54.420 --> 26:55.600]  No, I think it would be too tall.
[26:56.360 --> 26:57.420]  You want to get on me?
[26:57.720 --> 26:59.500]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was trying to say.
[27:00.000 --> 27:00.260]  Okay.
[27:00.540 --> 27:01.540]  I'll let you lead.
[27:01.880 --> 27:03.160]  Andrew, you stand on his head.
[27:06.020 --> 27:06.900]  There we go.
[27:06.900 --> 27:07.520]  Oh, God.
[27:08.380 --> 27:08.960]  We're centered.
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.060]  You got this, Geoff.
[27:10.060 --> 27:10.720]  Perfect.
[27:11.740 --> 27:13.380]  Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[27:13.560 --> 27:16.560]  I apologize. I thought I was right up against it.
[27:16.620 --> 27:17.040]  I'm sorry.
[27:17.100 --> 27:17.440]  It's okay.
[27:17.500 --> 27:17.820]  It's okay.
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.940]  Gavin's so fucking tickled with himself.
[27:31.880 --> 27:33.140]  I'm more just panicked.
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.200]  I'm in charge of your life.
[27:36.100 --> 27:38.300]  Oh, I mistimed it.
[27:38.620 --> 27:39.640]  God damn it.
[27:39.640 --> 27:39.920]  What?
[27:40.540 --> 27:43.800]  I just mistimed it. I was trying to get there as soon as possible.
[27:44.760 --> 27:47.100]  I never thought your one weakness would be lights.
[27:49.260 --> 27:50.220]  Geoff doesn't want to play anymore.
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.160]  Geoff doesn't want to play anymore.
[27:52.380 --> 27:52.940]  Oh, God.
[27:56.620 --> 27:58.700]  I just want to see what Eric's got to offer.
[27:58.820 --> 27:59.720]  Oh, Gavin.
[28:01.100 --> 28:02.380]  Got my lower chin there.
[28:03.200 --> 28:03.440]  Yeah.
[28:05.040 --> 28:06.380]  You know, this Eric's not bad.
[28:08.300 --> 28:08.860]  All right.
[28:10.760 --> 28:11.120]  So...
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.120]  Oh, Jesus. The key has to be up here.
[28:14.040 --> 28:14.400]  Right?
[28:15.540 --> 28:16.300]  You would think.
[28:16.440 --> 28:16.860]  Should we go upstairs?
[28:17.800 --> 28:18.520]  I don't know.
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.480]  Oh, that's a checkpoint?
[28:21.760 --> 28:23.240]  Hang on. Me and Gavin are going to go.
[28:23.360 --> 28:24.880]  Next time it changes, we're going to fly over.
[28:25.940 --> 28:26.680]  All right, here we go. Ready?
[28:28.120 --> 28:28.480]  Go!
[28:29.560 --> 28:31.400]  I don't know what Geoff... Geoff killed us.
[28:32.240 --> 28:32.920]  No, you guys got it.
[28:35.140 --> 28:35.460]  Oh.
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.160]  Oh.
[28:37.280 --> 28:38.740]  I think we got to head to you guys now.
[28:39.420 --> 28:40.520]  Well, how are you going to...
[28:40.520 --> 28:41.700]  Yeah, what's the... So, okay.
[28:44.920 --> 28:45.240]  Oh.
[28:47.640 --> 28:47.960]  Gavin.
[28:48.060 --> 28:49.260]  So I think we all got to do it together.
[28:50.040 --> 28:50.740]  I think so.
[28:51.320 --> 28:53.200]  We should probably stack.
[28:53.960 --> 28:54.760]  It's a great idea.
[28:57.400 --> 28:58.040]  I'm stuck.
[28:59.920 --> 29:00.940]  Okay, you can come on up, Eric.
[29:04.380 --> 29:04.780]  Ah.
[29:05.580 --> 29:07.280]  Are you figuring out that you can come on up, too?
[29:08.680 --> 29:08.900]  Okay.
[29:09.160 --> 29:10.320]  Nick just got jumping down.
[29:11.040 --> 29:12.920]  You think I wasn't mashing the A button?
[29:13.880 --> 29:14.740]  I don't think...
[29:14.740 --> 29:17.420]  No, I don't think you were. I was watching you stand there.
[29:18.000 --> 29:18.660]  All right, here we go.
[29:21.660 --> 29:22.500]  That was pretty good.
[29:23.920 --> 29:24.520]  Get down.
[29:25.180 --> 29:25.580]  Oh!
[29:26.900 --> 29:28.000]  We were done.
[29:28.360 --> 29:28.940]  Now we know.
[29:28.940 --> 29:30.120]  Now we know.
[29:31.740 --> 29:32.840]  Now we know.
[29:42.270 --> 29:42.670]  Okay.
[29:43.170 --> 29:43.570]  Tower.
[29:45.350 --> 29:47.570]  Are we all going to go on one?
[29:47.730 --> 29:48.130]  Oh, boy.
[29:48.930 --> 29:50.270]  Let's go. Okay, let's not.
[29:50.710 --> 29:52.430]  Go, go, go, go.
[29:53.370 --> 29:53.770]  Absolutely.
[29:54.650 --> 29:55.730]  I mistimed it again.
[29:56.370 --> 29:56.730]  It's okay.
[29:59.030 --> 30:00.070]  Go, go, go, go.
[30:00.070 --> 30:00.790]  Go, go, go, go.
[30:01.070 --> 30:01.570]  Go, go, go.
[30:03.590 --> 30:05.010]  Up the tower.
[30:05.470 --> 30:05.990]  Get in.
[30:06.490 --> 30:07.510]  Oh, my God.
[30:09.610 --> 30:11.590]  Somebody check Awesome Games Done Quick.
[30:11.710 --> 30:12.390]  That might be a record.
[30:19.610 --> 30:20.790]  Okay, five people.
[30:21.850 --> 30:22.330]  Easy.
[30:22.330 --> 30:22.570]  Easy.
[30:25.010 --> 30:25.510]  Eh.
[30:27.490 --> 30:27.990]  Okay.
[30:29.330 --> 30:30.310]  Oh, what the fuck?
[30:31.070 --> 30:31.510]  Oh, boy.
[30:33.310 --> 30:34.870]  Get away from the spike.
[30:35.190 --> 30:36.030]  Get away from the spike.
[30:36.430 --> 30:38.090]  Oh, and the wall.
[30:38.350 --> 30:40.230]  The ceiling also crushes you.
[30:40.550 --> 30:41.210]  It's all red.
[30:42.170 --> 30:43.250]  Anything red is bad.
[30:43.650 --> 30:44.650]  Should we make a front stack?
[30:45.150 --> 30:45.790]  Yeah, I think so.
[30:47.330 --> 30:48.550]  Stack on front.
[30:48.550 --> 30:49.370]  Oh, not yet.
[30:51.190 --> 30:52.590]  Now do it.
[30:52.670 --> 30:53.230]  Stack on front.
[30:53.850 --> 30:54.470]  Okay.
[30:56.690 --> 30:57.310]  Alright.
[31:04.070 --> 31:04.380]  Alright.
[31:08.500 --> 31:09.680]  Just be agile.
[31:10.460 --> 31:12.840]  Purple, blue, green, orange.
[31:12.980 --> 31:13.500]  I got it.
[31:14.100 --> 31:15.980]  Why did someone freak out?
[31:17.320 --> 31:19.740]  I think everyone's very calm.
[31:19.740 --> 31:20.680]  You just missed it.
[31:21.820 --> 31:23.600]  What do we...
[31:23.600 --> 31:25.620]  I think someone has to go forward.
[31:25.960 --> 31:26.760]  Go left.
[31:27.360 --> 31:27.580]  Okay.
[31:29.220 --> 31:31.700]  I think you guys went too left.
[31:32.400 --> 31:33.740]  Yep, that was on me.
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.100]  Yeah, it's okay.
[31:36.580 --> 31:37.340]  Yeah, we got it.
[31:37.880 --> 31:38.440]  We're learning.
[31:39.860 --> 31:41.060]  It's gonna start with blue.
[31:41.500 --> 31:43.080]  It's gonna end with blue.
[31:43.340 --> 31:44.580]  Purple, orange.
[31:45.900 --> 31:46.400]  Green.
[31:46.400 --> 31:46.780]  Green.
[31:47.620 --> 31:48.460]  Yep, trying.
[31:50.040 --> 31:51.740]  Green? What are you playing at?
[31:51.920 --> 31:54.860]  I couldn't go. Orange was on top of me.
[31:55.100 --> 31:55.280]  Okay.
[31:57.800 --> 31:59.160]  I think we got it here.
[32:00.440 --> 32:01.400]  Couldn't move left.
[32:02.240 --> 32:03.260]  It's boxed in.
[32:08.240 --> 32:11.940]  So we're just gonna make sure we're not too far on the right when we go on that section.
[32:11.940 --> 32:13.620]  Purple, orange, green, blue.
[32:14.680 --> 32:14.860]  Yep.
[32:14.860 --> 32:15.960]  It's a good call.
[32:16.940 --> 32:18.240]  Purple, go ahead.
[32:18.420 --> 32:18.840]  Please.
[32:21.540 --> 32:22.240]  That's on me.
[32:22.460 --> 32:23.940]  Absolutely on me. I'd like to apologize.
[32:26.800 --> 32:27.480]  That's fine.
[32:28.180 --> 32:31.060]  We're getting really good at this. We're finding all the ways to fail.
[32:31.280 --> 32:31.640]  Gotta wait.
[32:34.040 --> 32:36.240]  Alright, here we go.
[32:37.340 --> 32:38.740]  Didn't account for the movement physics.
[32:39.560 --> 32:40.240]  There we go.
[32:40.500 --> 32:42.180]  Come back left.
[32:42.180 --> 32:43.160]  Come back left a little.
[32:43.340 --> 32:43.800]  Little more left.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.020]  I think me and Geoff are too far left.
[32:47.240 --> 32:49.660]  This is it. Right here.
[32:50.920 --> 32:51.400]  Perfect.
[32:52.360 --> 32:52.980]  Hell yeah.
[32:54.180 --> 32:56.180]  What an exchange on that key.
[32:57.500 --> 32:58.420]  That went through everybody.
[33:00.240 --> 33:00.860]  That's teamwork.
[33:01.440 --> 33:02.800]  That was amazing teamwork.
[33:04.080 --> 33:05.480]  And this is where it breaks down.
[33:08.780 --> 33:09.240]  What?
[33:09.240 --> 33:11.340]  Are you gonna...
[33:11.820 --> 33:12.280]  Yeah!
[33:14.060 --> 33:17.920]  I think we died on literally every possible obstacle in that level.
[33:17.980 --> 33:19.360]  Which is great, but we got there.
[33:19.480 --> 33:21.340]  We were checking the code to make sure it was all working.
[33:21.680 --> 33:22.140]  Yes!
[33:22.960 --> 33:25.900]  Yeah, we're doing like some QA testing stuff.
[33:26.360 --> 33:26.600]  Yep.
[33:27.060 --> 33:27.520]  What?
[33:28.700 --> 33:29.640]  Oh, yes.
[33:30.140 --> 33:31.740]  Alright, suck me off.
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.900]  Thank you.
[33:34.520 --> 33:35.280]  What's this do?
[33:35.720 --> 33:35.980]  Alright.
[33:36.880 --> 33:37.460]  Oh, shit.
[33:37.520 --> 33:40.820]  Oh, boy.
[33:41.680 --> 33:43.780]  Well, I mean, we didn't even make it.
[33:44.620 --> 33:46.100]  We're gonna have to suck each other?
[33:46.460 --> 33:48.300]  We have to go to the very right.
[33:48.740 --> 33:51.580]  So I think what has to happen is the person on the very right...
[33:51.580 --> 33:54.440]  Don't worry, I'll try and get you, Blue.
[33:55.280 --> 33:56.080]  Purple's hanging out.
[33:56.200 --> 33:57.220]  Don't worry about them.
[33:57.340 --> 33:57.840]  They're busy.
[33:58.440 --> 34:00.840]  I was listening to your explanation.
[34:01.120 --> 34:01.280]  Uh-huh.
[34:03.580 --> 34:05.660]  I mean, I don't like this.
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.740]  Why did that happen?
[34:08.420 --> 34:08.820]  Just suck.
[34:09.960 --> 34:11.020]  Andrew wasn't sucking.
[34:11.900 --> 34:12.840]  He wasn't.
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.200]  Listen, I was over the edge.
[34:15.680 --> 34:16.760]  Go ahead and suck, man.
[34:18.080 --> 34:18.880]  Go ahead and suck.
[34:19.340 --> 34:21.140]  I can't move left. I'm trying.
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.420]  Red has to... there you go.
[34:22.800 --> 34:25.060]  The person in the back has to... there you go, guys.
[34:25.060 --> 34:27.860]  And then we just keep this suck line going, but face it the other way.
[34:27.940 --> 34:29.540]  But we have to turn it the other way.
[34:30.180 --> 34:30.820]  Turn around.
[34:31.320 --> 34:32.460]  Let me turn around.
[34:33.000 --> 34:33.820]  Everyone all the way.
[34:34.360 --> 34:35.300]  On the very edge.
[34:35.740 --> 34:36.280]  That's it.
[34:37.760 --> 34:40.640]  Oh, God.
[34:41.080 --> 34:42.780]  I think we gotta get over there.
[34:43.420 --> 34:44.260]  Keep moving right.
[34:45.580 --> 34:46.120]  Suck line.
[34:46.820 --> 34:47.600]  We're all sucking.
[34:49.280 --> 34:49.880]  Oh, no.
[34:50.000 --> 34:50.820]  We have to go the other way.
[34:51.960 --> 34:52.620]  It's okay.
[34:52.980 --> 34:55.520]  Once we're up there, we just have to face the other way and do it.
[34:55.880 --> 34:57.140]  We'll never run off.
[34:57.460 --> 34:57.940]  No, we're good.
[34:58.020 --> 34:59.100]  We got it.
[35:00.400 --> 35:01.460]  There you go.
[35:01.920 --> 35:02.960]  You're sucking me blue.
[35:03.660 --> 35:05.080]  What is Nick doing?
[35:06.800 --> 35:08.320]  Hold on. Shut the fuck up.
[35:09.560 --> 35:10.820]  You're facing the wrong way.
[35:10.920 --> 35:11.900]  I don't know what the explanation is.
[35:11.900 --> 35:14.720]  Gavin is sucking my face off.
[35:15.160 --> 35:15.900]  I can't move left.
[35:17.300 --> 35:18.700]  Nick facing the wrong way.
[35:19.560 --> 35:20.600]  Let's face the other way.
[35:21.140 --> 35:22.220]  Stop sucking, man.
[35:23.980 --> 35:25.160]  Nick, you're facing the wrong way.
[35:25.280 --> 35:25.640]  There you go.
[35:26.400 --> 35:27.000]  All the way.
[35:28.760 --> 35:29.800]  Sucking Nick's mouth.
[35:31.200 --> 35:33.220]  You're sucking my mouth the wrong way, Gavin.
[35:33.520 --> 35:34.660]  We gotta move all the way right.
[35:34.880 --> 35:35.960]  And then just turn the other way.
[35:36.380 --> 35:37.020]  Let go.
[35:37.020 --> 35:40.580]  We gotta get over there first.
[35:40.740 --> 35:41.440]  Red, what are you doing?
[35:41.660 --> 35:44.160]  There we go.
[35:44.380 --> 35:45.220]  Holy shit.
[35:45.800 --> 35:46.360]  Almost.
[35:46.640 --> 35:48.240]  That almost fucking worked.
[35:48.420 --> 35:49.020]  We're getting there.
[35:49.300 --> 35:50.960]  That almost fucking worked.
[35:52.500 --> 35:53.860]  It's the best level.
[35:56.560 --> 35:57.480]  Red, pull.
[35:57.760 --> 35:58.440]  Anytime, Red.
[35:59.560 --> 36:00.580]  Hang on.
[36:00.680 --> 36:02.420]  Why would you start it?
[36:02.540 --> 36:03.640]  Go, go, go.
[36:04.260 --> 36:05.460]  We don't have to go.
[36:05.620 --> 36:06.600]  It will come back.
[36:07.540 --> 36:09.600]  It's never going to return again.
[36:10.140 --> 36:11.940]  Then we won't die.
[36:11.940 --> 36:12.900]  Go, go, go.
[36:13.240 --> 36:13.800]  Red, pull us.
[36:14.180 --> 36:15.240]  I'm pulling.
[36:16.620 --> 36:17.140]  Nice.
[36:18.820 --> 36:19.520]  That's good.
[36:20.580 --> 36:21.240]  Good work.
[36:22.020 --> 36:22.600]  Super good.
[36:25.520 --> 36:26.560]  Now we're done.
[36:27.780 --> 36:28.560]  Excuse me.
[36:28.920 --> 36:30.320]  Now Green's got it.
[36:30.600 --> 36:31.720]  It sucked.
[36:33.360 --> 36:33.880]  Gavin!
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.360]  Remember when you asked me what I was doing?
[36:37.560 --> 36:39.540]  I just want to be very clear about what was happening.
[36:39.540 --> 36:41.100]  And that was Gavin sucking my face hole.
[36:42.880 --> 36:45.360]  Well, you also were never turning around when I wasn't sucking.
[36:48.180 --> 36:49.600]  How was I to know when you stopped sucking?
[36:49.600 --> 36:51.380]  What's a guy to do with it?
[36:52.700 --> 36:53.480]  And the level.
[36:55.680 --> 36:56.380]  And the level.
[36:56.900 --> 36:58.460]  I was waiting for orange.
[37:01.640 --> 37:02.800]  I want to get out of here.
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.180]  We're almost done with this game.
[37:05.280 --> 37:05.500]  It was easy.
[37:05.500 --> 37:07.540]  I swear, we start streaming.
[37:08.360 --> 37:09.460]  I get mildly giddy.
[37:09.560 --> 37:11.880]  And then a poo moves right next to my anus.
[37:12.140 --> 37:13.100]  Every week.
[37:13.940 --> 37:14.280]  Remember.
[37:15.580 --> 37:17.780]  I'm not going to remember that.
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.640]  Remember where you are.
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.040]  I don't have a block.
[37:22.580 --> 37:23.140]  Oh my god.
[37:23.680 --> 37:24.180]  Oh no.
[37:27.700 --> 37:29.080]  What am I doing?
[37:29.900 --> 37:31.480]  I think we're just going where we were.
[37:31.860 --> 37:34.260]  Yeah, but you have to remember your block color also.
[37:34.260 --> 37:36.420]  Because you have to move your block.
[37:36.940 --> 37:37.940]  To where it goes.
[37:38.540 --> 37:40.260]  So, orange, where was your block?
[37:40.560 --> 37:40.920]  There you go.
[37:42.820 --> 37:43.340]  Ah, shit.
[37:43.740 --> 37:45.120]  I'm in my spot.
[37:46.040 --> 37:47.560]  Get off my...
[37:47.560 --> 37:48.420]  I'm in my spot.
[37:48.660 --> 37:49.500]  Try again!
[37:50.780 --> 37:52.340]  Where's red's block supposed to go?
[37:53.580 --> 37:54.380]  Ah, shit.
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.000]  I want to see where red was.
[37:57.920 --> 37:59.660]  So, red, what was your plan?
[38:00.500 --> 38:02.260]  My plan was, I did not...
[38:02.260 --> 38:04.160]  Listen, I nailed...
[38:04.160 --> 38:06.520]  Nothing about that.
[38:07.280 --> 38:07.800]  Um...
[38:07.800 --> 38:08.520]  Aw, I missed.
[38:10.520 --> 38:11.700]  Hey guys, I did it.
[38:12.200 --> 38:14.460]  Oh, you have to be facing the same way
[38:14.460 --> 38:15.680]  and in the exact same spot.
[38:16.180 --> 38:17.740]  Like, exact same, right?
[38:18.240 --> 38:19.300]  Okay, got it.
[38:19.420 --> 38:21.280]  I know where mine is.
[38:22.860 --> 38:23.900]  And it's...
[38:23.900 --> 38:25.460]  Oh, don't forget your block also.
[38:25.760 --> 38:25.900]  Yep.
[38:27.520 --> 38:28.040]  Okay.
[38:28.040 --> 38:28.640]  Okay.
[38:29.720 --> 38:30.260]  Okay.
[38:30.480 --> 38:31.800]  Piss poor easy.
[38:33.340 --> 38:35.340]  I'm right here, locked in.
[38:36.860 --> 38:37.360]  Gavin!
[38:37.820 --> 38:38.360]  What?
[38:39.520 --> 38:40.500]  Get your red out of here.
[38:40.840 --> 38:41.360]  No!
[38:42.720 --> 38:43.240]  Okay.
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.340]  Is that close enough?
[38:46.960 --> 38:48.740]  Did you say close enough?
[38:49.300 --> 38:50.020]  Is it? I don't know.
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.580]  I don't know, I don't look at blue.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.920]  I mean, there's a circle, it'll circle around.
[38:54.920 --> 38:55.920]  Which way was I facing?
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.160]  That's...
[38:59.540 --> 39:00.340]  Finish.
[39:04.100 --> 39:04.900]  Good!
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.040]  I might give it to me.
[39:10.380 --> 39:10.640]  Yes!
[39:11.920 --> 39:12.400]  Yes!
[39:13.460 --> 39:13.840]  Yeah!
[39:14.920 --> 39:15.340]  Yeah!
[39:17.180 --> 39:18.160]  Way to go, boys!
[39:19.000 --> 39:19.620]  Nailed it!
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.020]  Did great!
[39:22.020 --> 39:23.140]  Get that key, boys!
[39:23.840 --> 39:26.000]  Eat my butt! That's awesome.
[39:26.480 --> 39:26.960]  Way to go!
[39:28.960 --> 39:30.240]  Yeah, the first round we did that,
[39:30.320 --> 39:31.860]  I didn't pay attention to the blocks at all,
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.500]  and then once you said that was a variable,
[39:33.720 --> 39:34.460]  I just didn't move.
[39:35.580 --> 39:36.600]  It's not happening.
[39:37.180 --> 39:37.920]  He froze up.
[39:39.240 --> 39:40.320]  Alright, we're halfway.
[39:40.620 --> 39:42.300]  Cleared world 3 levels.
[39:43.600 --> 39:45.660]  We're moving down into Danger Park!
[39:46.460 --> 39:47.140]  Oh no!
[39:48.460 --> 39:49.460]  A little parkour, maybe?
[39:49.460 --> 39:51.160]  To Danger Park.
[39:52.380 --> 39:53.500]  I missed my
[39:53.500 --> 39:54.720]  suck gun. Seems
[39:55.400 --> 39:57.580]  pretty safe so far.
[39:59.120 --> 40:00.160]  We know how to do this.
[40:01.480 --> 40:03.380]  Yeah, keep jumping at the exact same time.
[40:03.580 --> 40:05.060]  Thank you, M. Nudeson.
[40:05.360 --> 40:06.620]  Nudestrup? Nudestrup.
[40:08.420 --> 40:09.360]  So, what do you guys
[40:09.360 --> 40:09.780]  want to do?
[40:11.980 --> 40:13.640]  Gavin, now you go.
[40:13.800 --> 40:15.440]  Now I go. Now Eric goes.
[40:15.520 --> 40:16.320]  Okay, but what if we...
[40:16.320 --> 40:17.040]  Oh my god.
[40:17.100 --> 40:20.080]  Oh no, get flat. Get level.
[40:20.280 --> 40:21.400]  Get level. Get flat.
[40:22.380 --> 40:24.280]  I think this is gonna kill us, dude.
[40:24.580 --> 40:25.940]  Nah, there's no way.
[40:26.040 --> 40:27.580]  It's gonna stop.
[40:28.360 --> 40:29.600]  It's gonna stop.
[40:30.260 --> 40:31.080]  It's gonna...
[40:32.420 --> 40:34.360]  Somebody has to keep the door open, maybe.
[40:35.020 --> 40:36.620]  But I don't think we're tall enough.
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.380]  What if I wedge my head
[40:38.380 --> 40:38.920]  in the door?
[40:39.360 --> 40:42.180]  Oh, I like that. That's a good idea.
[40:42.440 --> 40:42.980]  You think so?
[40:42.980 --> 40:44.980]  So if you stand there...
[40:45.540 --> 40:46.060]  Well, don't worry.
[40:47.880 --> 40:48.180]  Okay.
[40:49.400 --> 40:50.400]  I'll stand there.
[40:50.940 --> 40:51.920]  Oh, okay.
[40:51.980 --> 40:53.720]  Alright, here we go.
[40:53.760 --> 40:56.160]  Okay, everyone go.
[40:57.160 --> 40:58.060]  Now you go.
[40:58.360 --> 40:58.880]  Now you go.
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.620]  Now you go.
[41:02.220 --> 41:04.920]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[41:05.220 --> 41:06.960]  That's the first time I've been
[41:06.960 --> 41:09.040]  genuinely upset the whole time we've played
[41:09.040 --> 41:09.380]  this one.
[41:09.380 --> 41:11.020]  That was so...
[41:11.020 --> 41:13.320]  That was so brain-dead simple
[41:13.320 --> 41:15.140]  to just keep going and
[41:15.140 --> 41:16.920]  everyone stopped in the door.
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.720]  Like, why did everyone stop?
[41:19.760 --> 41:21.440]  Not everyone. One person.
[41:21.700 --> 41:22.280]  One person.
[41:23.360 --> 41:24.620]  Don't do that shit.
[41:25.640 --> 41:26.860]  Dick's taking it personally.
[41:28.120 --> 41:28.720]  I am!
[41:29.640 --> 41:30.840]  Oh God.
[41:32.120 --> 41:32.920]  That's rough.
[41:33.000 --> 41:33.520]  How does that work?
[41:34.500 --> 41:36.860]  I think it goes in a pattern once you touch the key.
[41:36.860 --> 41:38.900]  Yeah, don't touch the key.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.200]  Let us go all the way right.
[41:40.620 --> 41:40.800]  Yep.
[41:42.380 --> 41:44.240]  And then we have to go...
[41:44.240 --> 41:45.360]  Oh, jeez. Hang on.
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.960]  Can I hide behind the block?
[41:50.260 --> 41:51.140]  Oh, you...
[41:51.140 --> 41:52.200]  Hey, Gavin.
[41:52.780 --> 41:54.360]  Gavin, did it work?
[41:55.300 --> 41:55.540]  Nah.
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.140]  We haven't seen the whole map yet.
[41:59.140 --> 42:00.520]  Yeah, I was just checking to see if it worked.
[42:01.120 --> 42:02.040]  That was awesome.
[42:02.500 --> 42:04.480]  Gavin has one hour a week to see
[42:04.480 --> 42:07.000]  how many years of Eric's life he can reduce.
[42:07.300 --> 42:08.040]  Yeah, he's doing great.
[42:08.280 --> 42:09.200]  He's really killing it.
[42:10.900 --> 42:12.880]  What do we have going together here?
[42:13.020 --> 42:14.400]  What don't we have figured out?
[42:14.940 --> 42:16.200]  I think we're just trying to...
[42:16.200 --> 42:17.240]  I think the block
[42:18.280 --> 42:19.640]  is gonna block it, right?
[42:19.940 --> 42:22.420]  We just need to get it closer to the key.
[42:24.240 --> 42:25.040]  You think
[42:25.040 --> 42:26.440]  that's what it is? You don't think the block
[42:26.440 --> 42:27.600]  at the top up here does anything?
[42:28.640 --> 42:30.140]  It's gonna block the one on the right.
[42:30.260 --> 42:32.500]  We just don't know the pattern until we figure out
[42:32.500 --> 42:33.380]  the pattern of this one.
[42:33.380 --> 42:35.420]  Should we jump up and grab the block?
[42:36.120 --> 42:36.640]  Yes.
[42:40.080 --> 42:42.080]  Maybe put one on each side?
[42:42.300 --> 42:43.480]  That was my thought.
[42:43.920 --> 42:44.460]  Right here?
[42:45.880 --> 42:48.120]  And then this one over this way?
[42:48.140 --> 42:48.800]  We'll all push together.
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.000]  And then, Red, you wanna jump and grab it?
[42:52.280 --> 42:52.760]  I'll grab it.
[42:53.480 --> 42:55.480]  I guess the question is...
[42:55.480 --> 42:55.740]  Ready?
[42:57.640 --> 42:58.780]  Okay, let's go.
[42:58.780 --> 43:00.020]  Go, go, go, go!
[43:00.560 --> 43:01.440]  It's gonna come back!
[43:02.240 --> 43:03.520]  So we have to keep pushing back.
[43:04.160 --> 43:05.340]  We just have to keep pushing the block.
[43:05.840 --> 43:07.940]  So after we get it, we'll push the thing the rest of the way.
[43:09.260 --> 43:10.800]  Babies. Just baby stuff.
[43:11.100 --> 43:12.060]  Don't jump into the key, hon.
[43:13.240 --> 43:14.080]  Sorry, I got excited.
[43:15.860 --> 43:17.160]  Were you trying to smash your grab?
[43:17.820 --> 43:19.000]  I thought maybe I'd make it.
[43:20.240 --> 43:20.900]  I thought maybe
[43:20.900 --> 43:22.280]  you guys were just going too slow earlier.
[43:22.880 --> 43:25.180]  So we do need to get the block up above, too.
[43:25.300 --> 43:26.860]  I think so, because it stops the second
[43:26.860 --> 43:27.660]  when I'm rolling.
[43:28.420 --> 43:30.080]  Alright, Blue and Green, you can figure this out.
[43:30.340 --> 43:31.740]  I was just waiting for Gavin to stop.
[43:32.080 --> 43:32.220]  We're good.
[43:34.940 --> 43:35.300]  Gavin?
[43:36.640 --> 43:37.620]  Alright, you got it, Gavin.
[43:37.920 --> 43:38.820]  Alright, let's do it.
[43:40.120 --> 43:40.900]  Alright, sounds good.
[43:42.000 --> 43:42.680]  Yeah, you got it.
[43:43.840 --> 43:44.900]  Yeah, you got it.
[43:46.400 --> 43:47.120]  You fucking...
[43:47.120 --> 43:49.700]  Eric, why'd you do it?
[43:50.800 --> 43:52.740]  If it's a hat, does it still kill you,
[43:52.860 --> 43:53.000]  do you think?
[43:53.000 --> 43:54.900]  Eric, you're turning into
[43:54.900 --> 43:56.340]  all the things that you hate.
[43:56.700 --> 43:57.120]  Yeah.
[43:59.840 --> 44:00.680]  Why would...
[44:01.920 --> 44:03.040]  I don't know why people
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.000]  say it in my name, but Eric's the one killing us
[44:05.000 --> 44:05.420]  every time.
[44:10.000 --> 44:10.420]  Don't
[44:10.420 --> 44:12.440]  do it, Eric, you little son of a gun.
[44:12.940 --> 44:13.860]  Son of a gun.
[44:14.260 --> 44:16.000]  You know Nick's mad when he almost curses.
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.080]  Yeah. Alright, let's go.
[44:19.360 --> 44:20.260]  Somebody, here.
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.060]  Eric, will you please go up to...
[44:22.060 --> 44:23.240]  Oh, okay, yeah, sure.
[44:23.660 --> 44:24.620]  Anyone wanna catch it like a hat?
[44:25.540 --> 44:27.760]  Oh, okay, cool. Oh, we wanna beat the level?
[44:27.920 --> 44:28.480]  Okay, let's do it.
[44:29.720 --> 44:32.140]  I kinda wanted to do that the last time you grabbed the key.
[44:33.000 --> 44:34.120]  Okay, Red, you wanna jump
[44:34.120 --> 44:34.520]  and get it?
[44:35.760 --> 44:37.400]  Do you want us to back off so you can...
[44:37.920 --> 44:39.640]  Let's push. Push boys.
[44:40.060 --> 44:41.780]  We gotta go past it.
[44:42.100 --> 44:43.640]  Why don't we just squash
[44:43.640 --> 44:45.660]  the green thing? Why don't we just kill it?
[44:45.880 --> 44:47.640]  Yeah, go for it. Yeah, go punch it.
[44:48.940 --> 44:50.040]  Go show him who's boss.
[44:50.040 --> 44:50.980]  Hahaha.
[44:52.620 --> 44:54.420]  We could've kept it as a pet.
[44:55.000 --> 44:55.640]  Hahaha.
[44:56.660 --> 44:57.340]  Pet bull.
[44:58.280 --> 44:59.580]  That real chain-chomp energy.
[45:00.820 --> 45:02.280]  Whoa! Whoa!
[45:02.460 --> 45:03.860]  Whoa! Whoa!
[45:04.140 --> 45:06.580]  Hey! I didn't even see what happened.
[45:06.660 --> 45:08.040]  What's going on?
[45:08.560 --> 45:08.860]  Ah!
[45:09.580 --> 45:10.500]  I'm alive!
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.340]  I'm just...
[45:13.340 --> 45:16.300]  I'm just like going. I don't know what to do.
[45:16.720 --> 45:16.920]  Ah!
[45:17.720 --> 45:19.080]  I don't know what to do.
[45:19.360 --> 45:20.840]  I don't know what to do.
[45:21.020 --> 45:22.900]  Well, look where the arrows come.
[45:23.200 --> 45:25.020]  Okay. I jumped into it.
[45:25.220 --> 45:27.040]  Fuck! Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[45:27.160 --> 45:28.600]  I see. The pattern, you gotta move.
[45:28.680 --> 45:30.640]  Okay, I'm on the right side, then I'm on the left side. Okay, I got it.
[45:31.660 --> 45:32.160]  Got it.
[45:32.780 --> 45:33.600]  You've killed me.
[45:37.060 --> 45:38.180]  You've killed me.
[45:39.320 --> 45:40.480]  Right side, left side.
[45:40.500 --> 45:42.120]  You keep killing me, Eric. Jeez.
[45:43.140 --> 45:43.860]  You lived.
[45:44.840 --> 45:45.460]  You lived.
[45:45.980 --> 45:47.060]  No, thanks to you.
[45:47.900 --> 45:50.460]  What do you mean? You landed on me and I kept you alive.
[45:50.720 --> 45:51.580]  Hey, how about this?
[45:51.680 --> 45:52.360]  How about this?
[45:53.520 --> 45:54.240]  Never mind.
[45:58.560 --> 46:01.180]  Three people is a lot for that one little ledge.
[46:01.720 --> 46:02.220]  What if...
[46:02.220 --> 46:03.180]  Nobody has to move.
[46:04.360 --> 46:06.400]  What if I move over and jump to the right
[46:06.400 --> 46:08.020]  where the door is to free up a spot
[46:08.020 --> 46:10.300]  on the one that I'm doing in the middle
[46:10.300 --> 46:12.060]  and then one of you from the left can land in the middle.
[46:12.060 --> 46:14.460]  Yeah, do that. And I'll go right, Gavin, you go left.
[46:15.260 --> 46:15.740]  I'll go left.
[46:16.080 --> 46:16.280]  Sweet.
[46:18.200 --> 46:18.580]  Nice.
[46:18.900 --> 46:19.280]  Oh.
[46:21.440 --> 46:22.540]  Gavin, who killed you that time?
[46:23.260 --> 46:24.940]  The block reappeared and killed me.
[46:27.060 --> 46:28.140]  Oh, shit, I forgot.
[46:29.180 --> 46:31.440]  Alright, me, Geoff, we didn't forget.
[46:32.040 --> 46:32.500]  I didn't forget.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.080]  No, I haven't forgotten most of the time.
[46:35.240 --> 46:35.700]  Oh, that's good.
[46:38.120 --> 46:39.320]  I mean, you kept walking.
[46:39.320 --> 46:41.060]  If you just land on me, I gotcha.
[46:41.800 --> 46:42.160]  Okay.
[46:42.880 --> 46:43.580]  I fucked up.
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.300]  So what happened there is that Geoff forgot.
[46:47.300 --> 46:47.780]  How did you die?
[46:47.860 --> 46:49.340]  I made a mistake there.
[46:51.560 --> 46:52.140]  Okay, I'm on you.
[46:53.980 --> 46:55.120]  Watch out for blocks.
[46:55.780 --> 46:56.500]  Stack on Geoff.
[46:57.240 --> 47:01.220]  Okay, so nothing falls from the ceiling again.
[47:01.400 --> 47:02.060]  No, no, no.
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.100]  We can take our time, but I feel like...
[47:06.100 --> 47:07.640]  I just didn't make it far enough, I'm sorry.
[47:08.240 --> 47:08.780]  That's okay.
[47:10.900 --> 47:11.460]  I win.
[47:11.700 --> 47:13.860]  I win, I just didn't get over fast enough.
[47:13.960 --> 47:14.320]  Okay, there we go.
[47:15.480 --> 47:16.080]  That's okay.
[47:16.960 --> 47:19.400]  No, you were faster than me on that one.
[47:20.280 --> 47:21.720]  Eric and I have this down to a science.
[47:21.820 --> 47:22.280]  Oh, we're good.
[47:23.280 --> 47:24.540]  We own two companies together.
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.640]  Alright, purple, jump on me.
[47:25.780 --> 47:28.760]  You wanna go, Andrew? You have the key.
[47:29.000 --> 47:30.180]  I'm just gonna wait.
[47:31.540 --> 47:32.300]  There you go.
[47:33.080 --> 47:34.360]  Alright, Gavin, you wanna go?
[47:34.360 --> 47:35.280]  Or you want me to?
[47:36.120 --> 47:38.260]  You want me to go? That's up to you.
[47:42.840 --> 47:43.820]  That's so funny.
[47:46.720 --> 47:48.620]  Okay, last one for Danger Park.
[47:49.120 --> 47:50.320]  Love it, Danger Park, easy.
[47:50.340 --> 47:52.520]  Man, we blew through Danger Park.
[47:52.960 --> 47:54.960]  Like the way Gavin blows through Halloween candy.
[47:55.080 --> 47:55.760]  Holy shit.
[47:56.740 --> 47:57.900]  I thought you were gonna say something else.
[47:59.020 --> 47:59.460]  Okay.
[47:59.980 --> 48:03.380]  Okay, so purple has to get the key?
[48:03.380 --> 48:03.860]  I'll get it.
[48:05.020 --> 48:06.760]  Blue has to get it now.
[48:06.840 --> 48:07.200]  Okay, key.
[48:08.680 --> 48:09.760]  Oh, it's so fast.
[48:13.100 --> 48:13.980]  And now...
[48:13.980 --> 48:15.880]  If you're in the middle...
[48:16.440 --> 48:17.800]  I don't think there's enough time.
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.140]  It might be from the floor.
[48:21.720 --> 48:22.400]  I think it might.
[48:23.180 --> 48:24.520]  But how do we do that?
[48:25.220 --> 48:25.980]  So I'd get it.
[48:26.360 --> 48:28.220]  So you have to walk all...
[48:28.220 --> 48:28.600]  And then stop.
[48:32.460 --> 48:34.220]  Oh, sorry, I just went a little too far.
[48:35.120 --> 48:37.220]  Everyone has to just move one up.
[48:37.500 --> 48:38.120]  That's all we're doing.
[48:38.220 --> 48:38.740]  One up.
[48:40.180 --> 48:42.660]  So Gavin, you gotta wait until the squiggly line is gone.
[48:45.940 --> 48:46.360]  Alright.
[48:49.830 --> 48:50.570]  I moved too late.
[48:50.570 --> 48:54.170]  My timing was off.
[48:58.540 --> 49:00.080]  What the fuck was that?
[49:01.420 --> 49:02.820]  You tried to jump the gun.
[49:04.960 --> 49:06.340]  I just wanted to be ready.
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.400]  So why'd you move so far, Blue?
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.780]  You only gotta move one.
[49:15.320 --> 49:15.780]  I know.
[49:16.500 --> 49:18.300]  I know what I've got to do.
[49:18.660 --> 49:19.480]  I moved too far.
[49:19.480 --> 49:20.160]  I have the key.
[49:21.460 --> 49:24.120]  You just told Gavin I only had to move one.
[49:24.280 --> 49:25.820]  I did the same thing.
[49:29.080 --> 49:31.040]  How did I not get there in time?
[49:32.340 --> 49:33.280]  That is so...
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.440]  Yeah, because I did it last time.
[49:38.640 --> 49:39.520]  I did it there.
[49:39.820 --> 49:39.920]  Gun!
[49:40.580 --> 49:41.580]  I have the key.
[49:42.020 --> 49:43.800]  You can make that run.
[49:44.500 --> 49:45.460]  That was impressive.
[49:47.920 --> 49:49.040]  That was me.
[49:49.900 --> 49:50.840]  Yeah, it was.
[49:51.180 --> 49:54.780]  And I'm sweating.
[49:56.060 --> 49:56.780]  I'm sweating.
[49:59.620 --> 50:01.460]  Once you're there, you can just move.
[50:02.620 --> 50:03.440]  You gonna stay on me, Gavin?
[50:03.800 --> 50:03.980]  Yeah.
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.300]  Hey, I don't think being on top of each other here is a good idea.
[50:09.820 --> 50:12.220]  It would work if we were a perfect totem.
[50:12.540 --> 50:15.220]  Right, so I don't think it's gonna be a good idea.
[50:16.060 --> 50:17.400]  You also, Purple,
[50:17.540 --> 50:19.960]  at the top, you don't have to just be...
[50:19.960 --> 50:21.160]  I know, I know.
[50:21.200 --> 50:22.140]  I realized it after I stopped.
[50:22.640 --> 50:23.080]  Who's B?
[50:25.180 --> 50:27.540]  That time I was just watching Geoff.
[50:27.900 --> 50:29.320]  I never had the key before.
[50:29.900 --> 50:30.400]  I panicked.
[50:35.000 --> 50:35.440]  Fuck.
[50:39.900 --> 50:41.620]  Yeah, I don't like the key responsibility.
[50:41.900 --> 50:43.160]  I'm like not even...
[50:44.120 --> 50:44.900]  Here's the thing.
[50:45.280 --> 50:47.480]  The other level, like some of the other levels
[50:47.480 --> 50:49.160]  I've been upset. I'm not even frustrated
[50:49.160 --> 50:50.640]  by this one. This is insane.
[50:51.300 --> 50:52.500]  This is so stupid.
[50:53.040 --> 50:54.120]  That's on me.
[50:59.620 --> 51:01.060]  It's been a while since I did that.
[51:09.660 --> 51:11.040]  It's too early. Fuck.
[51:11.500 --> 51:13.740]  I'm sorry. It's all good.
[51:14.000 --> 51:14.340]  It happens.
[51:14.340 --> 51:14.840]  It's okay.
[51:15.660 --> 51:17.040]  Nobody be mad.
[51:17.560 --> 51:18.720]  Everybody be happy.
[51:19.420 --> 51:20.360]  Fuck. Sorry.
[51:21.040 --> 51:22.760]  It wasn't just you.
[51:23.480 --> 51:26.060]  It's Jugs McTugs for the gifted sugs.
[51:26.400 --> 51:27.440]  Jugs McTugs?
[51:29.020 --> 51:29.460]  Is that a fake?
[51:30.960 --> 51:32.160]  Gavin just walked in.
[51:32.380 --> 51:34.540]  Gavin caught me and then walked me into the floor.
[51:39.630 --> 51:41.450]  Hey, Gavin didn't move at all.
[51:42.270 --> 51:43.470]  Gavin, are you okay?
[51:44.690 --> 51:46.830]  Gavin, are you here still?
[51:47.490 --> 51:47.770]  Yeah.
[51:52.530 --> 51:54.510]  My body won't let me succeed.
[51:54.970 --> 51:56.750]  Alright, next person to die sucks.
[52:01.470 --> 52:02.370]  It's you.
[52:03.150 --> 52:05.430]  It hasn't been me in a while.
[52:05.990 --> 52:07.130]  He ate so many hot...
[52:07.130 --> 52:07.570]  Oh.
[52:11.610 --> 52:12.850]  This might take an hour.
[52:13.190 --> 52:13.850]  This is one level.
[52:17.310 --> 52:18.290]  Geoff got me.
[52:18.450 --> 52:20.450]  Geoff went early and made me go early.
[52:20.570 --> 52:21.390]  That was really exciting.
[52:25.150 --> 52:26.290]  It's been a while since...
[52:27.290 --> 52:29.090]  It's been a while since I've been in the back.
[52:29.230 --> 52:30.010]  That was crazy.
[52:31.070 --> 52:32.570]  Going from the front to the back.
[52:32.670 --> 52:33.210]  Real different.
[52:37.130 --> 52:38.130]  Oh, it's hard.
[52:38.330 --> 52:40.150]  I don't think I've ever got the key.
[52:42.150 --> 52:43.510]  Oh, it's hard.
[52:44.750 --> 52:46.270]  I've never reached the key.
[52:46.450 --> 52:47.770]  You fucking blue bitch!
[52:48.010 --> 52:49.150]  What are you doing to me?
[52:50.170 --> 52:51.210]  Fucking move!
[52:52.890 --> 52:53.830]  Blue's got it.
[52:56.530 --> 52:57.810]  God damn it, Geoff.
[52:59.010 --> 53:01.570]  After complaining about Gavin, you do that?
[53:01.990 --> 53:04.110]  I'm having fun watching the chat
[53:04.110 --> 53:05.550]  because you can see how far back
[53:05.550 --> 53:07.110]  some people are when they call
[53:08.430 --> 53:09.190]  people out.
[53:09.590 --> 53:11.310]  When they're like, oh, Eric, how could you do that?
[53:11.350 --> 53:12.870]  It was three turns ago.
[53:25.550 --> 53:27.110]  Get off me.
[53:27.170 --> 53:27.570]  Get off me.
[53:29.370 --> 53:31.370]  Oh, no.
[53:32.710 --> 53:33.070]  No.
[53:33.410 --> 53:33.770]  Sorry.
[53:34.750 --> 53:35.110]  Sorry.
[53:36.890 --> 53:37.610]  I panicked.
[53:37.990 --> 53:39.790]  Did you look at me going for the key or something?
[53:39.890 --> 53:42.990]  I panicked when you started running.
[53:43.590 --> 53:44.690]  Oh, thank God it wasn't me.
[53:45.090 --> 53:46.170]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[53:46.310 --> 53:48.290]  Every time it's not me, I just go, oh, thank God.
[53:49.090 --> 53:50.170]  I just twitched.
[53:50.430 --> 53:51.530]  Do you still have the shit?
[53:52.290 --> 53:52.530]  Yeah.
[53:54.990 --> 53:55.790]  It's gonna be a while.
[53:57.070 --> 53:59.070]  Yeah, it's gonna be a long time.
[53:59.070 --> 54:01.250]  I think 60% of my
[54:01.250 --> 54:03.150]  attention is on the game and 40%
[54:03.150 --> 54:04.670]  is on my anus.
[54:08.120 --> 54:08.680]  God.
[54:10.680 --> 54:11.420]  Just listen.
[54:12.100 --> 54:13.280]  I think we've got
[54:13.280 --> 54:14.560]  20 minutes left.
[54:14.800 --> 54:15.160]  What?
[54:16.860 --> 54:18.120]  You were walking.
[54:27.580 --> 54:30.340]  That one fell swoop move is a little risky.
[54:30.660 --> 54:32.760]  I think that's the move.
[54:36.160 --> 54:36.940]  Oh, I finally
[54:36.940 --> 54:38.220]  get the fucking key properly.
[54:38.380 --> 54:39.380]  You did a great job.
[54:41.520 --> 54:42.600]  Andrew got net coded.
[54:42.780 --> 54:43.720]  Oh, hey.
[54:44.220 --> 54:45.020]  Good job, Nick.
[54:45.360 --> 54:48.280]  I was like, I'm gonna try this one fell swoop.
[54:48.480 --> 54:49.620]  Didn't think I was on the bottom.
[54:51.020 --> 54:52.120]  Well, we're all color coded,
[54:52.240 --> 54:53.000]  is the thing.
[54:53.560 --> 54:54.680]  Every time with Andrew.
[54:54.680 --> 54:55.520]  Uh-huh.
[55:01.780 --> 55:04.060]  I have not died
[55:04.620 --> 55:06.160]  as many times as others.
[55:06.880 --> 55:08.780]  I am not gonna be
[55:08.780 --> 55:10.040]  the burden of this.
[55:12.340 --> 55:13.460]  That's me.
[55:13.820 --> 55:15.440]  Every time with Andrew.
[55:16.020 --> 55:16.760]  That's me.
[55:16.940 --> 55:19.380]  I accept responsibility.
[55:23.140 --> 55:24.800]  Every time with Andrew.
[55:25.280 --> 55:26.720]  That one's Eric.
[55:27.580 --> 55:28.300]  I'm sorry, who?
[55:28.760 --> 55:29.820]  Who else was that?
[55:30.320 --> 55:32.340]  Every time with Andrew.
[55:37.360 --> 55:38.420]  Oh, me.
[55:38.760 --> 55:40.000]  This is not.
[55:41.020 --> 55:42.300]  Oh my god.
[55:42.420 --> 55:43.500]  I didn't even make it.
[55:43.640 --> 55:45.500]  This is not doable.
[55:46.900 --> 55:49.060]  We haven't even got to the hot bit.
[55:49.820 --> 55:50.640]  I fucking
[55:50.640 --> 55:51.540]  am in.
[55:52.880 --> 55:54.180]  Why'd you guys go so far?
[55:54.460 --> 55:55.740]  Why did the G's do that?
[55:57.220 --> 55:59.100]  We both went the same amount of
[55:59.100 --> 56:00.540]  too far.
[56:00.700 --> 56:01.640]  Not enough.
[56:05.320 --> 56:07.200]  Both went the same amount of not enough.
[56:10.260 --> 56:11.280]  Do you fucking purple?
[56:11.380 --> 56:11.600]  Fuck.
[56:12.240 --> 56:13.020]  Why would I?
[56:14.460 --> 56:16.340]  Why are you trying to clear both?
[56:17.720 --> 56:18.180]  Oh.
[56:30.560 --> 56:31.480]  I just...
[56:31.480 --> 56:32.720]  Oh, wow. Nice, Eric.
[56:34.400 --> 56:36.220]  Do we want to make the perfect stack?
[56:36.660 --> 56:36.900]  No.
[56:41.540 --> 56:43.340]  Is that the first time you moved?
[56:44.380 --> 56:46.740]  Yeah, I was really hoping someone else would fail.
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.060]  And then it didn't.
[56:48.120 --> 56:49.060]  It made it so much worse.
[56:50.900 --> 56:51.260]  Andrew,
[56:51.380 --> 56:52.740]  you did not move very quickly there.
[56:52.980 --> 56:55.060]  I moved as soon as I was able to.
[56:58.200 --> 56:58.840]  I'm sorry.
[56:59.080 --> 57:00.960]  I'm sorry. I was watching Gavin
[57:00.960 --> 57:02.760]  and just going, I don't think he knows it's his turn.
[57:08.640 --> 57:10.500]  Oh, I was too far and I knew it. I'm sorry.
[57:10.780 --> 57:12.540]  I knew I was too far. Fuck.
[57:12.800 --> 57:13.600]  It happens.
[57:13.880 --> 57:17.180]  It happens all the time, it turns out.
[57:19.060 --> 57:19.260]  Nope.
[57:19.460 --> 57:21.420]  Now, I will say,
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.040]  I hate that the chat is right.
[57:25.160 --> 57:26.740]  Why doesn't everybody
[57:26.740 --> 57:29.000]  just stand still until the one
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.860]  person with the key gets the door open
[57:30.860 --> 57:32.140]  and then take turns?
[57:32.620 --> 57:33.880]  I don't know.
[57:34.260 --> 57:36.720]  And I don't know why we never thought of that.
[57:37.620 --> 57:38.880]  How is that any different
[57:38.880 --> 57:40.540]  than what we're doing? We're just getting it done faster.
[57:42.180 --> 57:43.360]  It's all dangerous.
[57:43.980 --> 57:44.280]  Right.
[57:44.880 --> 57:47.520]  But, now I guess you're right.
[57:47.520 --> 57:49.360]  Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier.
[57:49.900 --> 57:51.640]  It really ratchets up the pressure
[57:51.640 --> 57:53.500]  as you watch one person go, though.
[57:53.620 --> 57:54.880]  I couldn't, I mean, I can't,
[57:55.180 --> 57:56.480]  I could not go, Gavin.
[57:56.700 --> 57:57.580]  Just so you know.
[57:57.940 --> 58:00.540]  I'm all for it, just for building tension.
[58:00.740 --> 58:01.220]  That was me.
[58:03.960 --> 58:05.000]  Well, thank you.
[58:05.160 --> 58:07.620]  I thought we were doing
[58:07.620 --> 58:08.600]  one at a time.
[58:08.860 --> 58:10.800]  We literally just talked about one at a time.
[58:11.040 --> 58:12.860]  We talked about it, we did not agree on it.
[58:12.880 --> 58:13.800]  Everyone watch me do it.
[58:13.800 --> 58:15.420]  Everyone stand still.
[58:15.760 --> 58:16.380]  You got it.
[58:17.400 --> 58:19.460]  I think I can jump one time, though.
[58:21.300 --> 58:21.760]  What?
[58:22.240 --> 58:23.680]  I think I can just do one little jump.
[58:26.840 --> 58:27.800]  Let me get around you.
[58:28.480 --> 58:29.340]  Take that back for me.
[58:29.540 --> 58:29.840]  There you go.
[58:31.060 --> 58:31.840]  This is all you, buddy.
[58:34.360 --> 58:35.000]  That was
[58:35.000 --> 58:35.880]  generous.
[58:37.380 --> 58:38.480]  Oh, that wasn't!
[58:38.860 --> 58:41.240]  Alright, person in the front, it's game time, baby!
[58:41.860 --> 58:43.320]  Maybe we should stack.
[58:43.320 --> 58:45.340]  Because then we'd be able to see how it
[58:45.340 --> 58:46.440]  lines up.
[58:47.220 --> 58:49.060]  We just gotta be under the block.
[58:50.400 --> 58:51.460]  Yeah, but I mean, look at how
[58:51.460 --> 58:53.320]  you can tell how easy it is on the
[58:53.320 --> 58:55.340]  left side because of the lower blocks. But on the right
[58:55.340 --> 58:56.820]  side, there's just the higher.
[58:57.140 --> 58:59.400]  So if we're stacked, we'll be able to see where we
[58:59.400 --> 59:01.360]  fall in that. Geoff, if it helps, I don't know what
[59:01.360 --> 59:03.940]  you're saying either. I get what he's saying.
[59:04.100 --> 59:05.180]  I understand what he's saying.
[59:06.140 --> 59:07.640]  I just don't trust the stack.
[59:07.880 --> 59:09.400]  No, me neither. But here's the thing.
[59:09.620 --> 59:11.320]  Everybody who's not the person
[59:11.320 --> 59:13.200]  on the bottom needs to put their controller down.
[59:13.460 --> 59:15.500]  One at a time. Oh, I just don't trust it.
[59:19.070 --> 59:19.510]  Okay.
[59:22.730 --> 59:23.910]  Oh, Gavin!
[59:24.250 --> 59:25.190]  Go left, go left, go left.
[59:25.270 --> 59:27.150]  Oh, you had the opportunity to do the funniest thing.
[59:27.350 --> 59:27.770]  Alright, purple.
[59:32.040 --> 59:33.340]  This is so much more
[59:34.560 --> 59:35.580]  pressure for everyone.
[59:36.660 --> 59:37.840]  I'm gonna fucking kill myself
[59:37.840 --> 59:38.560]  if I blow this.
[59:42.250 --> 59:43.610]  Alright, who's next?
[59:43.770 --> 59:44.710]  I'll go next, I'll go next.
[59:46.030 --> 59:46.590]  Boo!
[59:47.010 --> 59:49.270]  Oh god, you scared the fuck out of me.
[59:49.770 --> 59:49.990]  Oh.
[59:54.960 --> 59:57.160]  Geoff, do you want to go next or do you want to go last?
[59:57.780 --> 59:58.240]  No!
[59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.620]  No big deal.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.160]  I fucked it.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.100]  I'm so sorry.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.140]  The pressure really builds.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:17.410]  I'll be the last?
[01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:20.070]  You've already proven you can do it.
[01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:20.830]  Just man up.
[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:26.090]  Imagine how I feel.
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.050]  I suck at everything.
[01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:29.890]  I'll go next.
[01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:32.510]  Because Gavin has shown he can do it.
[01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.590]  Guys, we're counting down to 5-0-1.
[01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.170]  We want to say thank you so much
[01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.690]  for being here watching with us.
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.350]  Watching it live on twitch.tv
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:47.230]  slash the regulation.
[01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.550]  No!
[01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:50.930]  Let's stack.
[01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:52.170]  No!
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.870]  Yes! No!
[01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:55.150]  Fuck!
[01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:57.650]  Alright, Andrew, it's over to you.
[01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:58.450]  Easy.
[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:01.330]  Are we going to stack?
[01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:04.230]  No, I just don't want to be back there anymore.
[01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:05.550]  Same.
[01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.630]  It's stressful being back there.
[01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:09.650]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.750]  I just don't want to have to go through that danger
[01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:15.510]  as everybody else has already gone through the door.
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.950]  Fuck!
[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.310]  Fuck!
[01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.670]  Why did you go?
[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.790]  I got excited.
[01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:27.210]  Can we stack?
[01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.270]  I don't think we'll ever make the perfect stack.
[01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.950]  We can try.
[01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:35.270]  Next time Nick is first, we stack.
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.790]  Okay, next time Nick is first, we stack.
[01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.330]  Yep.
[01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.670]  But watch Andrew get all the way to the door right now.
[01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:42.250]  Yep. Easy.
[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:43.650]  Easy peasy.
[01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.410]  It's easy.
[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:45.350]  Easy clap.
[01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:47.930]  It's easy!
[01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:50.390]  Oh god.
[01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.050]  I'm going to take off my headphones.
[01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.410]  It's easy.
[01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.150]  Why would headphones make it easy?
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:57.250]  Okay, I put my headphones back on. What happened?
[01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:01.210]  Geoff, it's easy.
[01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:02.570]  Nope.
[01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.530]  Huh.
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.390]  Welcome to 501, the best time of the week, baby.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.080]  You just got off work and you're watching this.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.480]  You're a psycho.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.600]  Settle in.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.400]  It's going to be a long weekend.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.940]  Work has only just begun.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.920]  We play hard.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.100]  Geoff!
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.020]  That was nuts.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.740]  I thought I was going to fuck it up either way.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.360]  It was better I get it out of the way now.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.880]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.860]  I did it.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.420]  I reset it quicker.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.560]  I've had it.
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.160]  Nick is first! Let's stack!
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.680]  Alright, we'll do it.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.120]  Alright.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.040]  Andrew didn't want to stack that much.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.820]  Nick, I'm sorry.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:05.660]  You know what? It's all good.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.660]  Shit happens.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.060]  It's okay.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.940]  Yeah, you dropped the gun.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.940]  It's okay though. I appreciate the tenacity.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.240]  I like the tenacity.
[01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:18.910]  I like the word tenacity.
[01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.790]  It's tenacity.
[01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:26.270]  Ass city?
[01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.110]  Yeah, sequel to City of Angels.
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:33.130]  Eric, get away from him!
[01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:34.470]  No, I want to go.
[01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:35.430]  We can go.
[01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:37.810]  There's no reason to wait.
[01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.290]  If there's plenty of gap, there's no reason.
[01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:41.250]  We can just go.
[01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.350]  Aren't you the one who wants to do it one at a time?
[01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:46.130]  Yeah, but now you can see
[01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.850]  how far we've gotten.
[01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:49.530]  We know we're capable of doing it.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:54.690]  Has everyone got to the door?
[01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.890]  I'm going to stack on Nick.
[01:03:58.450 --> 01:03:59.530]  Let's work on the perfect stack.
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:00.650]  There you go.
[01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.230]  Andrew died.
[01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.390]  Who cares?
[01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.770]  I do!
[01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:08.410]  It was my key, Nick!
[01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.410]  We all could have shared the key!
[01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:11.810]  All that I had.
[01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.410]  Knew it.
[01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:16.610]  Alright, this is the stack run.
[01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.890]  Okay.
[01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:19.870]  Never mind.
[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.570]  He does not want to stack that bad.
[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:24.090]  No, I want to stack.
[01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:25.690]  He wants to stack.
[01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:29.870]  Next time.
[01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.330]  Geoff doesn't want to stack that bad.
[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:33.750]  I do, I just don't have the skills
[01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.870]  to stack the bills.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.660]  Alright Gavin, you got this.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.680]  Andrew hates stacking.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.480]  Andrew waits until I get the key
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.320]  then he just eats the first laser.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:50.880]  Let's stack.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.240]  I don't want to live anymore!
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.600]  I'm sorry Gavin, I didn't move.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.060]  That's on me.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.080]  I was just going to wait.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.880]  Oh, that was close.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.840]  I'm on top of Geoff.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.180]  Okay.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.220]  Andrew sees stack and he jumps off the cliff.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.480]  No!
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.380]  God damn it!
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.560]  As soon as people stack, Andrew's like,
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.320]  I'm over this shit.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.020]  Now we have to have the neatest stack
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.340]  the world has ever seen.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:21.900]  Alright.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.420]  Alright, now wait.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.380]  Micro adjustments.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.220]  Tiny adjustments.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.240]  Okay, I think blue needs to be...
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:31.460]  Okay.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.700]  I'm not right.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:36.540]  That's good.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.660]  How does this look?
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.780]  I think green needs to be over here.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.340]  Okay, hang on.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.120]  I'm trying to get in between his ears here.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.180]  A little too far.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.580]  Now who's on the bottom?
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.980]  I'm just trying to line this up.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.040]  It's hard to go little, little, little.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.840]  Don't move, Andrew!
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.620]  I'm waiting.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.800]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.120]  Use the d-pad. Micro tap.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.200]  I didn't know you could use the d-pad.
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.180]  That's good, that's good!
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.860]  I didn't know you could use the d-pad.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.020]  Oh, God.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.660]  This was your idea.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.040]  It's perfect.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.140]  The stack's perfect.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.380]  It's not the ship, it's the captain.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:18.180]  Fuck off.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:20.880]  Show him, Andrew.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.360]  Fucking show him, Andrew!
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.960]  What happened?
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.380]  Who went?
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.020]  Who did that?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.920]  Take responsibility.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:30.920]  Did you move?
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.700]  No, I didn't move.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.480]  Andrew just ran straight.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:36.720]  I'm getting the key!
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.240]  No, I mean last time.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:40.940]  Who did it?
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.980]  I will.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.380]  Purple, stay up there.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.760]  He's going back to my earlier analogy.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.540]  We were like one away.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.720]  So Nick angered the captain.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.800]  My bad.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.520]  No, I just tried to adjust.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.180]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.680]  Micro adjustment.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:02.160]  Green's on.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.540]  Hang on.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.100]  I think that's pretty good.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.260]  No, no, no.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.240]  This is as good as...
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.100]  Gavin, stop moving.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.860]  I'm trying to get perfect.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.700]  No, no, no, look.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.780]  Oh boy.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:26.880]  We're okay, we're okay.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.700]  Andrew, me and you were a little too far up.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.400]  We're getting good at this.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.320]  I went too fast.
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:38.180]  I went too fast.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.820]  Oh god.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.480]  Don't worry, this is the attempt.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.720]  Congratulations in advance, we're doing it.
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:52.580]  Is it?
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.240]  I'll wait until you two stack up.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.820]  Okay, I think that's good.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:00.700]  I think that's good.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.920]  I feel good about where we're at.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.220]  You think green should be over a little?
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.720]  When you're saying over, hang on.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.640]  Left or right?
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.340]  Just the tiniest bit.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:11.120]  How's that?
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.240]  Andrew, you tap slightly left.
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:20.800]  I wonder if it's different per screen.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.580]  That looks good.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.580]  My controller is set down, I'm not touching it.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.900]  Same, mine's down.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:29.780]  Mine is down.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.200]  Oh my god.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.120]  I'm freaking out.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.900]  Oh my god.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.880]  Oh my god.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.040]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.680]  Red, stop.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.100]  Red, go right.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:52.700]  Open the door.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.760]  Gavin, I'm going to...
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.200]  Gavin, I'm going to drive...
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.560]  Oh my god, Gavin, I'm going to beat you up.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.920]  I'm going to beat you up.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.420]  I'm going to...
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.480]  Everyone, get out of the way.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.520]  Orange has it.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.600]  Guys, I want to thank you so much for watching.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.720]  We did it.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.480]  Did you have fun? What if I went left?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.540]  But, guys, I would never do that.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.180]  Hey, guys,
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.540]  the next time, 501, you're going to try again.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:24.900]  Yeah!
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.340]  Gavin,
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.520]  Gavin fucking killed it.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.300]  Way to go,
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.380]  Gavin. How are you feeling?
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.360]  Gavin, how are you feeling?
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.160]  Well, I feel like the celebration was short-lived,
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.720]  because right after that, you said you were going to come and beat me up.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.040]  But you kept
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.800]  moving. All you had to do
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.700]  was stop, and you just started going
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.400]  left and right. Crazy.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.460]  Crazy.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.480]  We have 1, 2,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:57.760]  3,
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.800]  4, 5, 6,
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.500]  7, 8,
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.520]  9, 10, 11
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.720]  levels. Well, we're going to have
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.320]  some streams of this.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.140]  Oh, fuck.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.920]  Alright, well, we'll see you next time, guys. Thanks for watching.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.040]  Watch this on Tuesday
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.420]  and let us know who did the best job.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.580]  Uh, boy.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:18.240]  Woo!
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:20.320]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.120]  Bye!
