[00:00.000 --> 00:02.820]  Let's play some f***ing video games. Let's have some fun.
[00:04.140 --> 00:07.420]  Uh, you and Gavin should have a live level bet. I would love that.
[00:08.440 --> 00:12.480]  That may be some content you see, uh, tomorrow.
[00:13.220 --> 00:20.020]  We made a birthday video for Gavin, uh, tomorrow that we'll release as our Let's Play, I believe.
[00:21.220 --> 00:25.640]  And... that could potentially reignite, uh, some level races.
[00:27.780 --> 00:29.860]  How's the new chair? The new chair is so good.
[00:30.600 --> 00:35.740]  Oh man, it's so nice. It is way better than, uh, the broken chair, obviously.
[00:35.900 --> 00:37.160]  Not that that's a high bar.
[00:39.920 --> 00:41.220]  But... I'm lovin' it.
[00:42.520 --> 00:43.720]  Let's launch into this.
[00:44.380 --> 00:46.460]  I don't know anything about this outside of it's apparently good.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.420]  You press all the buttons. I haven't pressed all the buttons.
[00:52.420 --> 00:58.660]  I saw in the subreddit somebody, I think, put together, like, a tutorial thing.
[00:59.340 --> 01:02.980]  That I wanted to look at. I noticed last night. I just, I didn't open it. I fell asleep.
[01:03.440 --> 01:04.840]  But, uh, I need to.
[01:08.260 --> 01:08.920]  Hey, Phoenix.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.920]  Oh, this is 100%. Now a comment leaver dragon.
[01:21.840 --> 01:23.200]  Hey, welcome Ninja Pastry.
[01:24.100 --> 01:25.600]  Ninja Pastry sounds good.
[01:26.260 --> 01:30.220]  Like, just as an idea. Like a sneaky, a good surprise pastry.
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.280]  You can't go wrong with a surprise pastry.
[01:36.240 --> 01:40.060]  Boilers or stars tonight? Uh, I hope stars. But I don't really care.
[01:41.620 --> 01:43.500]  But I'd lean more Dallas stars.
[01:50.330 --> 01:51.030]  Hey, Soudgold.
[01:53.750 --> 01:59.190]  Uh, I gave up Regulation Lister status a long time ago. I am all in on comment leaving. Awesome.
[02:00.130 --> 02:04.190]  Nothing wrong with comment leaving. I feel like some people feel like being a comment leaver is a bad thing. Not at all.
[02:04.930 --> 02:05.650]  It's just a preference.
[02:07.230 --> 02:08.970]  Okay, let's get into this. This is gonna be messy.
[02:09.450 --> 02:11.130]  Oh, wow, so this is really...
[02:12.030 --> 02:14.670]  I hate that gun, so I'm gonna avoid that.
[02:16.870 --> 02:18.670]  Can I reseal these?
[02:21.130 --> 02:24.090]  I wonder to what extent this is, like, Call of Duty. So it's Wave 1.
[02:25.110 --> 02:28.330]  Oh, shit. Oh. Oh, fuck.
[02:29.110 --> 02:29.390]  Okay.
[02:31.410 --> 02:35.410]  Oh, I gotta... yeah. You're supposed to melee the first waves.
[02:37.590 --> 02:40.090]  I think I fucked up by just using all my ammo.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.480]  Okay.
[02:47.180 --> 02:48.480]  Can we seal these?
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.920]  I can activate this?
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.220]  .600. Fuck it.
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.620]  What did I just do?
[03:02.670 --> 03:03.350]  Oh.
[03:03.350 --> 03:03.930]  Is that health?
[03:05.030 --> 03:06.870]  I have no idea. Whatever.
[03:07.910 --> 03:10.170]  Let's get some melees going. Get more points.
[03:12.330 --> 03:13.750]  Okay, I'm now injured.
[03:15.990 --> 03:17.150]  Does it recharge or no?
[03:17.930 --> 03:18.770]  Oh, battle rifle.
[03:19.850 --> 03:20.410]  Oh, fuck.
[03:21.710 --> 03:21.970]  Oh!
[03:22.850 --> 03:23.530]  Oh!
[03:24.130 --> 03:24.630]  Okay.
[03:25.550 --> 03:27.190]  Let me grab this.
[03:29.650 --> 03:31.470]  That cost me anything?
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.060]  Health recharges.
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.360]  So although this says burger, I don't think that this is a burger.
[03:44.540 --> 03:46.540]  I don't... I don't understand.
[03:50.230 --> 03:51.910]  Get away. Get away.
[03:54.790 --> 03:57.990]  Surprise Prime hasn't been shoehorned into the pack a bunch.
[03:59.270 --> 04:00.210]  Let's back up.
[04:01.490 --> 04:03.350]  Has anyone played this that's in the chat?
[04:05.850 --> 04:10.290]  This is a custom mode, but they put it into the official playlist.
[04:10.550 --> 04:12.170]  So it has proper matchmaking.
[04:14.130 --> 04:15.250]  It's always the climb.
[04:16.250 --> 04:17.930]  Is it in official mode? Am I wrong?
[04:18.710 --> 04:20.070]  I thought it was forge mode.
[04:21.830 --> 04:24.790]  But then like, I guess what is official mode at this stage?
[04:26.430 --> 04:27.450]  Oh, we open that?
[04:28.730 --> 04:32.570]  Am I just opening doors when I'm hitting that thing down below?
[04:37.380 --> 04:38.220]  Oh, oh!
[04:39.300 --> 04:40.880]  Oh, no, no, no, reload, reload!
[04:42.320 --> 04:42.720]  Okay.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.520]  Oh, give me this.
[04:48.820 --> 04:49.520]  Hell yeah.
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.880]  I wonder if this counts for the challenges, because I'm still doing challenges every week.
[04:59.580 --> 05:01.300]  I don't know where that guy was trying to go.
[05:05.370 --> 05:06.030]  Oh, melee?
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.100]  Juggernaut? What is this?
[05:15.440 --> 05:16.320]  Andrew, are you still sick?
[05:17.020 --> 05:17.820]  Uh, sort of.
[05:18.160 --> 05:21.560]  Like, I'm better than I was, but I definitely still have some lingering.
[05:26.670 --> 05:28.510]  Aw, thank you so much, Blazer.
[05:29.770 --> 05:31.030]  Oh, oh, no!
[05:31.250 --> 05:32.210]  I can't, oh, no!
[05:32.490 --> 05:33.510]  Okay, okay.
[05:34.050 --> 05:34.710]  It's okay.
[05:35.590 --> 05:38.310]  I was just reading the chat and walked into like eight guys.
[05:38.730 --> 05:39.870]  Okay, we're good.
[05:40.230 --> 05:40.650]  Whoa!
[05:41.710 --> 05:42.170]  Okay.
[05:43.350 --> 05:45.590]  I can see how this could get overwhelming pretty quick.
[05:46.450 --> 05:47.170]  What's this?
[05:47.650 --> 05:48.370]  Is this an ability?
[05:51.350 --> 05:52.530]  It's okay, I have time.
[05:55.110 --> 05:55.910]  Invisibility, maybe?
[05:56.550 --> 05:59.670]  I don't remember what that symbol is, or is that the teleport one?
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.010]  Ooh.
[06:11.810 --> 06:12.270]  21.
[06:12.750 --> 06:14.570]  Okay, so it counts down.
[06:14.670 --> 06:15.830]  That's how many zombies are in a wave.
[06:16.310 --> 06:17.430]  I'm starting to get this a little bit.
[06:20.470 --> 06:22.270]  I still don't understand how that works.
[06:28.650 --> 06:31.710]  I was never the biggest Call of Duty zombie guy.
[06:32.950 --> 06:37.950]  So maybe there's just things that would be obvious if you played more that are not registering for me.
[06:39.270 --> 06:42.690]  It was really cool, I just, I never had like a core group to play with.
[06:44.270 --> 06:54.810]  And it got so layered as the zombie games extended, like the puzzles in them and all the things you had to do built on itself in an insane way, but it was fun.
[06:55.270 --> 06:58.090]  Especially when they started bringing in like recognizable actors.
[06:59.550 --> 07:01.210]  Okay, we got Brutes.
[07:03.230 --> 07:04.190]  Oh, shit.
[07:05.230 --> 07:07.830]  Is there any other weapons? I don't like that.
[07:10.450 --> 07:13.930]  Is it D-Swan once I pull it from the wall, I'm guessing? No?
[07:17.610 --> 07:19.050]  Points 3,075.
[07:21.750 --> 07:23.950]  I'm gonna try activating that thing again.
[07:28.080 --> 07:28.560]  Oh!
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.460]  Oh, it gives a random weapon.
[07:32.020 --> 07:33.400]  Did I just not have the points before?
[07:35.320 --> 07:36.860]  Wait, is it combining weapons?
[07:37.830 --> 07:41.980]  Cause I feel like I'm shooting the shotgun out of this.
[07:43.900 --> 07:45.960]  What the fuck is...
[07:46.860 --> 07:47.740]  What is happening?
[07:48.680 --> 07:49.820]  This is crazy.
[07:53.560 --> 07:55.960]  Oh! No, I don't like running.
[07:56.680 --> 07:57.720]  Calm down.
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.340]  Oh, fuck, that one was visible.
[08:01.400 --> 08:03.060]  Get back, get back, get back.
[08:07.340 --> 08:08.160]  Uh, oh!
[08:10.000 --> 08:10.520]  Get away!
[08:11.380 --> 08:12.240]  No, get away!
[08:12.920 --> 08:13.560]  Get away!
[08:14.800 --> 08:15.520]  Oh, no!
[08:19.170 --> 08:21.630]  You got this, Halo 1183517!
[08:23.690 --> 08:25.190]  Oh, there's still so many guys left.
[08:25.350 --> 08:26.670]  Oh, I can... Oh!
[08:28.190 --> 08:29.710]  Awesome, but I lose all my shit.
[08:30.310 --> 08:31.030]  Dammit, okay.
[08:34.330 --> 08:37.290]  That is, uh, not an effective weapon.
[08:37.690 --> 08:38.930]  We need to replace that.
[08:41.190 --> 08:41.550]  Hey!
[08:42.690 --> 08:43.050]  Oh!
[08:46.670 --> 08:48.950]  Oh, shit. Grenade, grenade. No, I don't have any grenades.
[08:49.930 --> 08:51.650]  Oh, boy. Okay, we're running, we're running.
[08:53.370 --> 08:55.290]  We're running. We're not going that way.
[08:55.710 --> 08:56.750]  We're turning back around.
[08:57.190 --> 08:58.330]  Oh! Oh!
[09:00.470 --> 09:00.830]  Goddammit.
[09:03.850 --> 09:05.310]  Hey, where's the rest of the team at?
[09:05.630 --> 09:10.630]  Uh, Nick and Eric had to do a 100% eat thing.
[09:10.850 --> 09:15.970]  Geoff has stuff going on in his personal life that's, like, that sounded ominous, but, like, fun stuff.
[09:16.670 --> 09:23.110]  Um, and then Gavin has been traveling, so it's just me today.
[09:25.590 --> 09:28.610]  Aw, the rest of the crew's off to a dirty week in the Bahamas? I'd love that.
[09:28.610 --> 09:32.190]  Everyone else just hanging out at Sloppy Joe's on their way.
[09:32.990 --> 09:35.930]  We need to do another Sloppy Joe's bingo soon. That was a lot of fun.
[09:36.810 --> 09:38.750]  I really enjoyed that with our community.
[09:40.570 --> 09:42.030]  Are you ready for the Final Shape?
[09:42.390 --> 09:51.030]  I know nothing about the Final Shape. Final Shape is the last Destiny content, I believe, right, for Destiny 2? Like, the bit, the last DLC expansion?
[09:51.710 --> 09:56.310]  I didn't play Last Light, I think, as the one before it.
[09:56.310 --> 10:02.970]  I really fell off of Destiny when they started, uh, deleting content that you'd pay for.
[10:03.590 --> 10:09.490]  It just, like, it made it feel not important in the seasonal model. I just, I found it kind of confusing.
[10:10.370 --> 10:13.670]  It was both too much and also felt like nothing at all to me.
[10:14.950 --> 10:20.950]  Uh, so I really haven't played a lot of Destiny 2 in probably, I don't know, two years, at least?
[10:20.950 --> 10:27.550]  But I hope it's great. Like, I'd love for them to really nail the story and put a through line on that.
[10:27.830 --> 10:35.210]  I'd love a Destiny 3. I just don't understand some of the decision making they've done as far as their DLC releases.
[10:36.070 --> 10:41.550]  Like, even just trying to understand if I wanted to catch up how I, what I would need to buy is so confusing.
[10:47.920 --> 10:53.640]  Game audio is a little overpowering versus your voice. I can adjust that, Ali. That's no problem.
[10:55.620 --> 10:57.300]  Let me... I say that.
[11:05.230 --> 11:06.030]  What about now?
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.500]  Andrew, how much time do you have today? Want to start a last run? No, I should not.
[11:15.860 --> 11:18.580]  I never want to start another last run after doing that.
[11:21.120 --> 11:25.120]  Is it a bit better? Do you want me to, I can boost it even more if needed.
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.900]  It'd be great to have a regular Destiny raid for the Vault of Glass. I would love to do that.
[11:34.370 --> 11:40.510]  Sweet. I am recording all this as well, so this will be a VOD that comes up on Tuesday for us.
[11:40.610 --> 11:46.190]  And I am using a mic in a direct feed, so it will look and sound better in VOD form.
[11:47.210 --> 11:52.350]  That was okay. Like, that was impressive for what it was, but I think we're probably going to move off of that and play something else.
[11:54.810 --> 12:02.490]  I think that's really cool as an idea, and it's amazing they made that. And if you loved zombies, I could see that being a lot of fun.
[12:02.490 --> 12:08.130]  But, let's do something else. Let's swap it up. Let's see what my challenges are. Do we go into Ranked, maybe?
[12:09.530 --> 12:11.390]  Oh, Ranked Snipers. Feels like a mistake.
[12:16.490 --> 12:22.110]  Going to win a match, splatter an enemy with a vehicle, win another match, multi-kill. Okay.
[12:27.320 --> 12:32.680]  Have you ever played the remake in Destiny 2 or just the original? Have you ever played the remake?
[12:33.560 --> 12:35.940]  Oh, that's not for me. That's a response to somebody else.
[12:36.880 --> 12:42.820]  Let's do Ranked Snipers. Let's try this. Oh, I've played three of five? Let's get my ranking in Ranked Snipers.
[12:43.700 --> 12:47.800]  Do two of these. I forgot that we're still technically in a season.
[12:48.940 --> 12:53.660]  So we are in the Banished Honor, I believe, and there's three days left.
[12:55.000 --> 13:03.220]  I'm working on getting the coins. They swapped from if you do a weekly, you get an ultimate reward to you now get currency to buy stuff.
[13:04.160 --> 13:10.940]  But the highest item to buy is more expensive than if you were to do most of the dailies and weeklies.
[13:11.040 --> 13:13.220]  So I haven't actually bought anything with my coins.
[13:13.440 --> 13:15.780]  Top right, 26,500.
[13:22.090 --> 13:25.910]  Did you play much Firefighter, King of the Hill? I played a little bit of it. I really enjoyed that.
[13:26.050 --> 13:27.730]  I enjoyed that a lot more than the Call of Duty thing.
[13:28.550 --> 13:31.510]  Is Halo multiplayer friendly for new players? Easy to get into?
[13:32.350 --> 13:38.350]  That's tough to answer. I don't think it's any harder than any of the other existing titles.
[13:39.110 --> 13:44.570]  The Halo Infinite player base, I don't know what it's at anymore, but at one time it was pretty small.
[13:44.950 --> 13:49.610]  So you're going to get a lot of people that are largely playing a lot, which can be a lot to go through.
[13:50.990 --> 13:55.990]  Do you play every week for rewards? I do. Still getting the weekly ultimate every week.
[13:57.010 --> 13:58.550]  Thank you for the good luck.
[14:02.870 --> 14:09.090]  It's almost as if 343 wants you to spend real money on their free multiplayer game. Totally, but there's no way to buy.
[14:09.430 --> 14:16.750]  There's no cash transaction you can get for that aspect of their store.
[14:17.450 --> 14:23.210]  So it's not like I could just pay for it. It just feels like their balancing is maybe a little bit off.
[14:23.210 --> 14:28.990]  I don't know what they gain. I guess maybe the idea is if I play more, I'm more incentivized to buy stuff?
[14:29.210 --> 14:32.110]  But that's just not how I've ever operated.
[14:33.570 --> 14:37.150]  What do you and Geoff think of Celtic's match?
[14:37.290 --> 14:41.150]  I haven't talked to Geoff specifically about it, but I'm sure he's excited.
[14:42.050 --> 14:45.910]  I'm sure he is terrified because I think the Celtics are a huge favorite.
[14:46.850 --> 14:51.010]  It has felt like that team should win for a long time now.
[14:51.870 --> 14:56.450]  The fact that I'm still searching for matchmaking. Estimated wait? 2 minutes 20 seconds?
[14:57.390 --> 15:02.210]  Jesus. Okay, remember what I said about smaller player counts and stuff?
[15:02.310 --> 15:06.230]  That is certainly the case in ranked snipers. So it might be tough.
[15:07.710 --> 15:12.890]  You honestly might have better luck playing the Master Chief collection if you're going to try to get into Halo.
[15:17.100 --> 15:20.200]  Do you have the chair or the long keys? I do.
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.960]  I got the chair for long. Anything. It's great. I would love to do a long sloppy Joe stream.
[15:28.320 --> 15:29.680]  Um. I'm I'm prepared.
[15:29.900 --> 15:35.000]  I now have the ability to sit for long periods of time doing dumb stuff.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.420]  Need a chair for a long back.
[15:44.300 --> 15:49.060]  Although the last year I had no backrest at all because of it breaking, but we make it work.
[15:50.420 --> 15:51.780]  It sucked, but we make it work.
[15:55.310 --> 16:00.790]  Oh, really? You've had worse luck with the Master Chief collection? That's surprising.
[16:02.290 --> 16:06.050]  Are you guys going to continue Escape Academy? Also, would you guys consider playing Sea of Thieves together?
[16:06.830 --> 16:09.010]  Absolutely going to continue Escape Academy.
[16:09.710 --> 16:13.410]  And we've played one episode. We filmed a let's play in Sea of Thieves.
[16:14.190 --> 16:21.190]  But Nick doesn't have a lot of experience doing multicam, so that has been sort of a testing thing for him.
[16:21.190 --> 16:27.050]  I think we probably won't do more multicam until we bring somebody on to do that for us.
[16:30.090 --> 16:32.370]  Love these Friday afternoon streams. Oh, thank you so much.
[16:33.050 --> 16:35.850]  I'm so glad you like them. I love that we're doing these.
[16:36.330 --> 16:46.570]  I think it's a really fun way to interact with the community and just, you know, be able to do like trivial pursuit where y'all were putting in answers.
[16:46.650 --> 16:49.490]  It's so much fun. I'd love to do more of that.
[16:49.490 --> 16:54.650]  I've been looking into more Twitch enabled stuff, but it's outside of Jackbox.
[16:55.430 --> 16:59.290]  There's not always the best choices or like the integration isn't what you'd want.
[16:59.910 --> 17:07.570]  There's a family feud game that I'd love to play that if it was like Twitch chat versus another party is awesome.
[17:07.670 --> 17:10.370]  But their Twitch integration in the game makes no sense.
[17:13.190 --> 17:16.690]  I am live. Cult of the Lame is a great game.
[17:17.890 --> 17:20.050]  Yeah, Trivial Pursuit chat integration was amazing.
[17:20.390 --> 17:23.590]  We ever do Patreon subathons? I don't know.
[17:24.350 --> 17:26.510]  Would you carry on the regular stream with long, long back?
[17:29.630 --> 17:32.150]  I'm so happy that you're going to be able to enjoy these in the summer.
[17:33.570 --> 17:36.190]  There's nothing better than being in school and having summer off.
[17:36.590 --> 17:41.330]  What a time. That and like two week Christmas vacation highlights.
[17:42.710 --> 17:46.090]  Great feelings. Summer vacation, especially though.
[17:47.390 --> 17:50.710]  I'll say that I'm so happy you all start fuck face that I got to continue into this.
[17:51.450 --> 17:53.670]  Oh, thank you so much. That means so much to us.
[17:53.710 --> 17:57.790]  I'm so glad that we are able to add some laughter to your day.
[17:58.670 --> 18:03.610]  It has certainly meant so much to us having the support and being able to make this content.
[18:05.150 --> 18:07.110]  It is hard to imagine.
[18:09.010 --> 18:11.310]  Navigating life without having the space.
[18:12.750 --> 18:14.950]  It's just it's brought us so much joy.
[18:16.690 --> 18:20.870]  Life hack, get a job at a school like me and you still get those vacations.
[18:21.910 --> 18:23.930]  First of all, thank you so much for being a teacher.
[18:24.530 --> 18:26.270]  Those are very important jobs.
[18:27.250 --> 18:29.930]  I guess the trade off is the pay, right?
[18:30.910 --> 18:33.050]  Teachers should be paid a lot more than they are.
[18:38.950 --> 18:40.630]  Vacations are great though, I imagine.
[18:41.890 --> 18:44.010]  It's so funny, I've been thinking about that in school.
[18:44.010 --> 18:47.910]  I was homeschooled through high school.
[18:48.570 --> 18:52.890]  So I didn't really have that teacher day to day experience in that way.
[18:53.310 --> 18:58.610]  But elementary school, it felt like those people were like 60 as a kid.
[18:59.310 --> 19:03.630]  My second grade teacher felt like they were probably 70 or 60.
[19:04.090 --> 19:06.630]  Everyone feels so old, they all feel like adults.
[19:07.690 --> 19:13.550]  And having the thought that I'm probably older than some of my teachers were at that time.
[19:13.550 --> 19:20.830]  Definitely, I had some substitute teachers come in that were certainly mid-20s at the oldest.
[19:22.230 --> 19:28.030]  It's so weird to now think like, oh fuck, I would not be able to handle a classroom of kids.
[19:28.650 --> 19:31.890]  That is insane that there are people my age that are doing this job.
[19:35.440 --> 19:38.020]  Sure, yeah, like totally a mix of old.
[19:38.200 --> 19:40.120]  I definitely had very old teachers as well.
[19:40.120 --> 19:46.520]  But the vast majority were probably like, I'd assume, late 20s to early 30s.
[19:50.290 --> 19:52.430]  Oh, your fifth grade teacher lived on the street?
[19:52.570 --> 19:53.310]  Oh man.
[19:57.090 --> 19:58.270]  That is tricky.
[19:59.230 --> 20:02.770]  I missed school one year.
[20:03.630 --> 20:06.110]  Not well, no, I didn't miss school for a year. Jesus.
[20:06.630 --> 20:10.670]  I skipped school one day and it was Halloween and I trick or treated.
[20:10.670 --> 20:14.690]  And I ended up in the same neighborhood as my principal, which I didn't know.
[20:15.030 --> 20:15.930]  And that was very awkward.
[20:17.130 --> 20:19.610]  I absolutely got yelled at the following day.
[20:21.630 --> 20:23.050]  Oh, thank you so much, Ramos.
[20:24.810 --> 20:31.350]  Yeah, it seems like I'm going to give this, if we don't have a match by 1227, we're moving on.
[20:31.790 --> 20:36.070]  As much as I want to be ranked, I don't know how I played three games.
[20:37.010 --> 20:39.890]  Analyst run, ranked arena, I'm ass at snipers.
[20:42.290 --> 20:43.810]  NFT Steven is in a game?
[20:45.110 --> 20:45.710]  I'm jealous.
[20:48.470 --> 20:51.790]  Oh, you had to hide from your teacher in Target? That's incredible.
[20:52.730 --> 20:57.550]  My teacher in a school for SEN kids and had a chair thrown at me last week.
[20:58.110 --> 20:58.430]  Wow.
[21:00.290 --> 21:03.010]  Do you still have your flamethrower? I do still have the flamethrower.
[21:03.610 --> 21:07.750]  A middle school social studies teacher, super glad to be off for the summer.
[21:07.990 --> 21:12.090]  I'm glad for you, too. You enjoy your summer vacation. It is well deserved.
[21:14.410 --> 21:16.230]  Other people are saying they found games.
[21:17.890 --> 21:20.550]  We can fill up a Garfield lobby, we can fill up ranked snipers.
[21:23.130 --> 21:30.570]  If we took over ranked snipers and just general Halo, that would say a lot about the state of Halo Infinite's multiplayer, sadly.
[21:30.570 --> 21:32.370]  At least for ranked snipers.
[21:33.090 --> 21:35.370]  I'm going to back out. I just don't think this is meant to be.
[21:35.930 --> 21:41.030]  Let's play Tactical Slayer.
[21:42.450 --> 21:45.930]  That's typically pretty fast. I'm awful at it, especially when filming.
[21:50.340 --> 21:51.260]  That sounds awesome.
[21:55.420 --> 21:57.420]  Rest in peace, ranked snipers, indeed.
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.380]  Thank you so much for watching, GoldStandard46.
[22:10.730 --> 22:13.210]  Yeah, you're definitely now Comet Lever Pigeon Tears.
[22:20.880 --> 22:23.780]  Yeah, maybe I'll go into Firefight King of the Hill as well.
[22:30.840 --> 22:35.280]  Just really any game would be nice. I was expecting more gameplay in my Halo experience.
[22:36.380 --> 22:39.740]  But these load times...
[22:40.580 --> 22:48.700]  I'm streaming through my Xbox right now. Does anyone know if you're streaming through the Xbox on Twitch, can you play 360 games?
[22:57.820 --> 23:00.780]  Because if we play 360 games, I'm just going to swap games.
[23:06.330 --> 23:08.810]  Let's try it. Let's see if we break anything.
[23:09.570 --> 23:13.250]  Because we've been... okay. We're going to have to be quick.
[23:23.240 --> 23:25.260]  Are we back? Are we...
[23:25.260 --> 23:29.660]  Oh, hell yeah! Okay, this works. Let's do Burnout Revenge. Let's play a game.
[23:29.960 --> 23:32.800]  No wait times. You haven't seen this content.
[23:33.700 --> 23:37.860]  But we have been filming a lot of videos with old demo discs on Xbox.
[23:37.860 --> 23:39.640]  And we've been playing a lot of race games.
[23:40.420 --> 23:43.880]  And Burnout Revenge... I'm typically not a car game guy.
[23:44.160 --> 23:46.140]  But I loved Burnout Revenge.
[23:46.400 --> 23:50.160]  So I've been playing so much of this recently.
[23:51.420 --> 23:53.240]  So let's do this. Let's just lock in an event.
[23:53.740 --> 23:58.020]  I got all these achievements and stuff in the past. Or at least I think I did.
[23:58.860 --> 24:00.760]  I'm not going to look. That's going to pause the stream.
[24:01.420 --> 24:05.440]  Let's just do this. If you're not familiar with Burnout Revenge, it's a really dumb car game.
[24:05.440 --> 24:07.180]  In like the best ways.
[24:13.880 --> 24:16.020]  Oh, is my audio choppy? Fuck!
[24:16.940 --> 24:23.990]  Nothing wants to work. Okay, what about now?
[24:24.670 --> 24:28.310]  Is it still choppy? Are we good now?
[24:28.510 --> 24:31.470]  Okay. Maybe it's just the menus.
[24:34.130 --> 24:36.050]  Is the mic audio choppy still?
[24:38.070 --> 24:40.010]  Still choppy. God damn it.
[24:41.770 --> 24:43.730]  Okay. We're going back to Halo.
[24:44.910 --> 24:48.010]  We'll find a game. We're going to find...
[24:49.630 --> 24:51.690]  What about now? Are we still choppy?
[24:54.310 --> 24:55.350]  Are we back?
[24:59.220 --> 25:01.560]  Immediately fixed. Okay, well there we go.
[25:02.020 --> 25:05.220]  I can't play backwards compatible streaming. We've figured that out.
[25:05.420 --> 25:07.760]  Let's find the fastest 28 seconds.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.060]  We're doing this. What a disaster of a stream.
[25:12.640 --> 25:13.300]  But that's okay.
[25:16.260 --> 25:17.580]  They are holding us hostage.
[25:19.680 --> 25:24.660]  This might be the least gameplay of any stream that is a gameplay stream.
[25:25.480 --> 25:26.420]  In the history of streams.
[25:32.330 --> 25:33.930]  That's very sweet of you, Mark Sally.
[25:34.870 --> 25:40.230]  I'm enjoying just talking to you all. It's nice to be able to do that in this way.
[25:53.700 --> 25:55.720]  Somebody just said I know a lot of gameplay streams
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.180]  that are spending 90% of their time in menus, talking.
[26:00.360 --> 26:01.740]  I don't watch a lot of streams.
[26:02.540 --> 26:07.360]  That is just a perception I don't have. That makes me feel a little bit better that this has been
[26:07.860 --> 26:11.520]  just this. Maybe this is more of a Q&A, I guess.
[26:11.780 --> 26:12.880]  Than a gameplay stream.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.120]  What a lovely community we have here.
[26:20.260 --> 26:21.820]  Oh my god, it's a game!
[26:22.520 --> 26:25.660]  We have an amazing community. We're so lucky to have the community that we have.
[26:26.280 --> 26:27.240]  Y'all are incredible.
[26:34.110 --> 26:37.070]  My favorite animal? Oh, what a tough question.
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.060]  I mean, a monkey is fun. Like a chimpanzee?
[26:44.680 --> 26:46.300]  That's a fun animal.
[26:52.420 --> 26:55.920]  I feel lucky to be a part of this community. Grizzly bear?
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.980]  Oh, the grizzlies are cool.
[27:03.020 --> 27:06.400]  Feelings on sloths? They're okay.
[27:07.620 --> 27:10.600]  There's a video game that Rooster Teeth was related to
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.360]  in some way called Sloth Battle. What was the sloth
[27:14.360 --> 27:16.580]  game that Rooster Teeth had an affiliation with?
[27:18.880 --> 27:20.600]  It was fine. It was a fun game.
[27:26.680 --> 27:31.160]  It was not Ratty Boy. I wish... oh, imagine if Rooster Teeth
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.400]  developed Ratty Boy. Battle Sloths! That was it. Thank you.
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.120]  I am Ginger Dale. That was the game.
[27:40.500 --> 27:43.320]  It was fun. I think you can unlock
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.840]  like some Rooster Teeth themed cosmetics in it.
[27:46.940 --> 27:50.200]  Back during the Rooster Teeth making video games days.
[27:52.280 --> 27:54.600]  Oh! Fuck.
[27:56.620 --> 27:59.180]  Fun story about Rooster Teeth making video games days.
[28:00.220 --> 28:03.500]  They were the console publisher I believe
[28:03.500 --> 28:07.160]  of Bendy and the Ink Machine. Which I think is
[28:07.160 --> 28:10.300]  like a really big game on PC. Or it was.
[28:11.060 --> 28:12.840]  And they ported it. They were part of the port.
[28:14.140 --> 28:18.260]  And they wanted Achievement Hunter to film
[28:19.120 --> 28:23.220]  guides in it. Like content. So that was designated to me.
[28:23.600 --> 28:26.720]  Because that was the type of thing I would do when I was doing contract work for Achievement Hunter.
[28:26.720 --> 28:29.220]  But the achievements were broken.
[28:29.980 --> 28:32.440]  I am trying to remember the specifics of the story.
[28:33.440 --> 28:38.720]  The UI gave no indication of how many things were
[28:38.720 --> 28:42.560]  in the game for certain collectibles. And they changed the number of them.
[28:42.720 --> 28:46.700]  So I couldn't use previous guides that existed to cross reference
[28:46.700 --> 28:50.440]  the numbers. So I ended up having to play Bendy and the Ink Machine
[28:50.440 --> 28:54.720]  like four times. Just to film guides. That never came out.
[28:55.480 --> 28:57.960]  None of the footage I used
[28:58.500 --> 29:03.000]  ever turned into anything. So I have this weird relationship
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.580]  with Bendy and the Ink Machine where I think some people love those games
[29:06.580 --> 29:10.680]  and it is a drag whenever I think about that first one.
[29:11.580 --> 29:12.660]  I think there might be multiples.
[29:15.040 --> 29:19.060]  It's probably the most amount of hours I put into a game that I didn't
[29:19.680 --> 29:20.580]  necessarily love.
[29:22.300 --> 29:25.140]  Oh, the ads were absolutely dead by that time.
[29:25.480 --> 29:28.700]  We did a few. I shot a
[29:28.700 --> 29:32.920]  Resident Evil 7 collectible guide. I think that was the last
[29:33.840 --> 29:36.820]  proper guide that was made. I think it was just
[29:36.820 --> 29:40.700]  like, hey, we need to make some content in this game to support it and give some attention
[29:40.700 --> 29:41.880]  to that this is available.
[29:45.620 --> 29:48.700]  So that was the idea. But clearly it was not a huge priority
[29:48.700 --> 29:51.040]  because that content never came out.
[29:58.610 --> 30:01.430]  I have not seen the regulation
[30:01.430 --> 30:05.110]  Minecraft world that Discord came out. Or that was posted on Discord.
[30:06.330 --> 30:09.770]  Along with Rooster Teeth. I started in
[30:09.770 --> 30:11.950]  2016 officially.
[30:13.410 --> 30:16.410]  And then was there until it got shut down.
[30:18.230 --> 30:19.450]  Just as a contract.
[30:29.510 --> 30:31.610]  We are getting
[30:31.610 --> 30:35.990]  rolled. I'm just realizing. 23 to
[30:35.990 --> 30:39.830]  7. And I have 5 of the kills.
[30:41.290 --> 30:43.830]  MarkyMark98 let me down. How dare you MarkyMark.
[30:44.470 --> 30:45.770]  I believed in you.
[30:48.450 --> 30:50.570]  I don't even recognize... is that gold?
[30:51.430 --> 30:55.270]  So if you look when you die
[30:55.990 --> 30:59.750]  in this game. I'm sure it will happen soon enough.
[31:00.450 --> 31:02.570]  I'll point it out for people that aren't familiar.
[31:03.710 --> 31:06.230]  They changed the ranking system in this game.
[31:07.710 --> 31:10.490]  So you get XP. They didn't add it until later.
[31:10.650 --> 31:15.150]  I played a bunch of games that just didn't count. Which kind of sucks. But they eventually made it.
[31:15.370 --> 31:18.850]  So you get ranks based on experience.
[31:19.290 --> 31:22.270]  And it just accumulates. And it's the same as their
[31:23.030 --> 31:26.550]  ranking levels. But this is just for gameplay experience.
[31:26.630 --> 31:30.290]  Wins and losses don't contribute. There's no way to lose
[31:30.290 --> 31:34.150]  experience. It's just purely a reflection of time
[31:34.150 --> 31:38.190]  played from that point. And if you see on their name
[31:38.190 --> 31:42.210]  where it says the guy killed me on the right. That symbol. It's all the same symbol as you start
[31:42.210 --> 31:46.190]  in bronze. You go through to onyx. I think I am on
[31:46.190 --> 31:48.310]  one of the last tiers of gold.
[31:50.070 --> 31:52.310]  It is a cool system to reflect
[31:53.790 --> 31:56.170]  the time you've put into this game. But it's
[31:56.170 --> 32:00.550]  sort of annoying that I had so many
[32:00.550 --> 32:04.250]  games not count. I also feel like it kind of screws me because
[32:05.070 --> 32:08.570]  and maybe this is a player based thing once again. I don't
[32:08.570 --> 32:12.250]  think they ever claim that they're matchmaking based off of that. But I
[32:12.250 --> 32:14.570]  definitely am getting matchmade based off of that.
[32:19.930 --> 32:20.950]  I was even saying
[32:20.950 --> 32:24.410]  the ranks. This is probably why it took so long to match me. Maybe. Like it is
[32:24.410 --> 32:28.350]  crazy if they use that as a primary matchmaking
[32:28.350 --> 32:32.430]  pairing tool. Because it's not a reflection
[32:32.430 --> 32:35.110]  of skill. It's just a reflection of time spent.
[32:36.170 --> 32:40.590]  Which is not an implication of skill. I am standing
[32:40.590 --> 32:43.630]  proof that you can do something a lot and not be good at it.
[32:55.370 --> 32:56.030]  Get him!
[32:57.090 --> 33:01.350]  Oh shit! I'm getting killed a lot by Project
[33:01.350 --> 33:05.550]  Meta. Which I feel
[33:05.550 --> 33:09.370]  like in Halo especially I see Meta. I think Rooster Teeth
[33:09.370 --> 33:13.350]  Red vs Blue. I wonder what the odds are that they are
[33:13.350 --> 33:15.110]  aware of Meta and all that.
[33:19.860 --> 33:23.780]  Did my whole team quit? Essentially my whole team quit. Outside of Mr. Pick.
[33:24.400 --> 33:26.440]  We just got 4 kills and 7 deaths.
[33:27.360 --> 33:31.800]  We're not judging. That's fine. I got AI.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.720]  I got Wiggle Cat and Meowmer. What a team.
[33:37.960 --> 33:38.920]  Take that Meta.
[33:42.020 --> 33:43.620]  Oh can I sneak one more kill in before
[33:44.480 --> 33:45.980]  they get to 50? Haha!
[33:47.540 --> 33:51.080]  Take that. Gonna turn it around here.
[33:52.560 --> 33:54.840]  29 consecutive kills before
[33:54.840 --> 33:57.120]  they get one.
[34:10.380 --> 34:11.940]  Banged on her. Challenges.
[34:12.600 --> 34:19.830]  Definitely didn't win. Let's get some more points.
[34:25.660 --> 34:26.300]  Okay.
[34:28.840 --> 34:30.500]  I thought I'd do more challenges
[34:30.500 --> 34:34.260]  than that. That was disappointing. Let's do a big team
[34:34.260 --> 34:36.600]  battle. That's a minute 17.
[34:37.980 --> 34:42.280]  Squad battle, 58. Oh Husky Raid?
[34:42.380 --> 34:51.130]  Let's do a Husky Raid. What would you do if you had
[34:51.130 --> 34:55.470]  1k and the option to shoot a horse or buy a Herman Miller chair?
[34:56.030 --> 34:58.150]  I would definitely buy the Herman Miller chair.
[35:00.790 --> 35:03.250]  Welcome to being comment leaver status
[35:03.250 --> 35:12.320]  Gildamore. Oh thank you so much for watching, DarkMaming.
[35:21.970 --> 35:23.990]  Okay, Gavin just wants to kill horses.
[35:24.330 --> 35:33.770]  I've never called Gavin before.
[35:37.630 --> 35:38.510]  Let me text Gavin.
[35:43.690 --> 35:46.930]  I'd rather kill a horse.
[35:49.330 --> 35:50.990]  Wait, what is the hypothetical?
[35:51.710 --> 35:55.390]  $1,000 to kill a horse or get a Herman Miller chair?
[35:55.490 --> 35:58.010]  Or would you kill a horse for a Herman Miller chair?
[36:05.030 --> 36:07.390]  The Umidigi Bison has never called Gavin
[36:07.390 --> 36:09.750]  before. I don't think I can call people in the US with my phone plan.
[36:10.890 --> 36:15.430]  I'm just going to ask him if he'd kill a horse for a Herman Miller. Not officially endorsed
[36:15.430 --> 36:19.510]  by Herman Miller. This is not their
[36:19.510 --> 36:20.190]  advertising.
[36:23.250 --> 36:26.450]  Herman Miller, the chair that people would murder horses for.
[36:29.010 --> 36:30.410]  I'm going to get kicked for inactivity.
[36:30.410 --> 36:32.670]  Would you kill a horse?
[36:38.440 --> 36:41.840]  Miller. It will Herman autocorrected to German.
[36:42.520 --> 36:44.160]  A German Miller chair.
[36:46.340 --> 36:50.040]  Okay, let's play this game. We've got to get a win.
[36:53.930 --> 36:55.450]  Oh! Oh!
[36:56.250 --> 36:58.270]  They went invisible and that really threw me.
[37:04.580 --> 37:08.200]  That's right, speed run on the bison. I was personally insulted
[37:08.200 --> 37:12.360]  recently where I got a text alert for a sign in
[37:12.360 --> 37:16.000]  to my Amazon account and it described my
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.860]  Umidigi Bison as generic
[37:19.860 --> 37:24.200]  Android. It's very hurt. It's a top of the
[37:24.200 --> 37:28.120]  line, high quality phone. They need to recognize the
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.060]  bison for what it is. Do you think HarryHR3 is
[37:32.060 --> 37:36.140]  also texting their friend if they would murder a horse for a Herman Miller?
[37:44.280 --> 37:45.100]  Oh, okay.
[37:45.180 --> 37:45.220]  Oh, okay.
[37:45.220 --> 37:48.000]  I got a reply from Gavin. Is the horse about to die anyway?
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.200]  What do we say chat? Is the horse on the edge of death or is this a
[37:52.200 --> 37:59.960]  perfectly healthy horse? Young and healthy?
[38:00.620 --> 38:04.200]  Oh, it seems like unanimously the chat is all about this being a healthy horse.
[38:05.300 --> 38:07.480]  Even close. Baby horse.
[38:07.480 --> 38:08.800]  Healthy and young.
[38:11.360 --> 38:13.380]  I'm going to take healthy and young.
[38:18.800 --> 38:21.620]  Healthy and young. Gavin is
[38:21.620 --> 38:25.660]  actually, I believe, editing the Krutoth right now, which will be available
[38:25.660 --> 38:29.020]  soon. I know that's something people have been excited about.
[38:32.920 --> 38:35.300]  I'll give you an update on his healthy
[38:35.300 --> 38:38.600]  and young. The horse is Black Beauty.
[38:44.500 --> 38:45.440]  Let me get it.
[38:45.460 --> 38:45.880]  Let me get it.
[38:47.080 --> 38:47.440]  No!
[38:50.120 --> 38:52.180]  We're so close to scoring and it's not at all deserved.
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.240]  Gavin doesn't think he can do it. As good of a chair as Herman Miller is, he
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.180]  doesn't have it in him. Where are you going? Oh, never mind sir.
[39:02.900 --> 39:05.880]  I'm a fool. You know where to go. Just ignore me.
[39:05.880 --> 39:08.580]  I got no fucking idea what's happening.
[39:14.380 --> 39:16.840]  I am so lost.
[39:17.800 --> 39:19.160]  Jesus Christ!
[39:27.960 --> 39:31.600]  Okay, we got it. If we win this, this is the least deserved win
[39:31.600 --> 39:33.060]  of my Halo career.
[39:37.610 --> 39:39.210]  Oh, the shields!
[39:42.110 --> 39:43.250]  Why did you
[39:43.250 --> 39:47.270]  take it into their base? I'm in no position to
[39:47.270 --> 39:49.330]  judge in this match, but that was a move.
[39:51.090 --> 39:54.070]  Oh, 2-2. Okay, we can do this.
[39:56.690 --> 39:57.690]  Holy shit!
[39:59.070 --> 40:00.750]  Everything is exploding in my screen.
[40:15.350 --> 40:17.830]  Let's get some good weapons. Let's make a push.
[40:18.790 --> 40:22.050]  Here we go. Oh, I got you, Victor.
[40:23.870 --> 40:25.230]  I don't got you, Victor.
[40:25.770 --> 40:29.390]  Go! Go! Come on! Oh, come on!
[40:29.870 --> 40:33.210]  Come on! Sneak! Sneak! Oh, it's so close!
[40:35.270 --> 40:36.410]  Any of us!
[40:37.630 --> 40:41.330]  Anyone! Grab it! Grab it! Come on!
[40:42.810 --> 40:44.850]  Ah, fuck! Stop them!
[40:44.850 --> 40:47.990]  Get them! Return it!
[40:48.430 --> 40:52.190]  Return it! Victor, you got this!
[40:53.590 --> 40:55.350]  Oh, no! Come on!
[40:56.710 --> 41:01.090]  Come on! Ah, it was so close!
[41:05.210 --> 41:06.450]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[41:06.910 --> 41:10.850]  Let's just hide. This is not what I wanted.
[41:10.990 --> 41:14.170]  This is stressful. We're lined up.
[41:15.610 --> 41:19.090]  There's flags on each side. It's going to come down to who can get the kill first.
[41:24.550 --> 41:25.890]  Oh, this is weird.
[41:25.890 --> 41:26.950]  We are locked in.
[41:33.500 --> 41:35.520]  It is just me today, unfortunately.
[41:43.720 --> 41:46.540]  I'll return it. Y'all got this!
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.460]  I just realized one of the people on my team is called Gay Satan.
[41:54.600 --> 41:55.080]  3963.
[41:56.360 --> 41:58.980]  We got Victor Canseco,
[41:59.340 --> 42:01.600]  Gay Satan, and HarryHR3.
[42:04.460 --> 42:07.340]  How long am I streaming today? Probably...
[42:07.660 --> 42:11.320]  90 minutes, I'll say. Maybe a little bit less.
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.860]  We'll see how we're doing. We just recorded an episode.
[42:16.180 --> 42:19.120]  My throat is still not fully
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.600]  100%. I'm a little tired, so maybe somewhere between 60 and 90 minutes.
[42:24.240 --> 42:25.400]  Plus, I'm doing this solo.
[42:28.660 --> 42:31.200]  We'll see. Stick around as long as I can.
[42:36.430 --> 42:38.770]  What the fuck happened? I looked at the chat
[42:38.770 --> 42:42.730]  for a second. This is not good. Oh, we lost. It's over.
[42:45.190 --> 42:45.630]  Yeah.
[42:46.850 --> 42:50.350]  I mean, listen. I had 5 kills, 13 deaths.
[42:50.590 --> 42:53.830]  That was on me. Let's do that again. I like that game mode.
[42:58.590 --> 43:00.110]  Thank you, my master
[43:02.670 --> 43:04.730]  CyclonusHD. I'm happy that we have our IP
[43:04.730 --> 43:11.490]  back as well. Who won the Spelling Bee?
[43:11.590 --> 43:13.530]  That is a great question, Lee Bratton.
[43:15.010 --> 43:19.690]  The kid that I selected won the Bee this year. Big winner.
[43:20.050 --> 43:23.450]  I've never won the Spelling Bee before. Our kid was locked in.
[43:23.550 --> 43:25.630]  It went to a spell-off. It was very exciting.
[43:32.880 --> 43:35.540]  We didn't talk about it on the podcast
[43:35.540 --> 43:38.380]  today. It did not come up, which you'll hear on Wednesday.
[43:39.560 --> 43:43.180]  We did talk about something else, though, that I'll tease
[43:43.180 --> 43:47.120]  right now. We are... expect...
[43:48.520 --> 43:51.180]  How do I want to tease this? There is
[43:51.180 --> 43:55.200]  a thing that we've talked about that has
[43:55.200 --> 43:59.240]  been asked about quite a bit that will be available next week. And if you're
[43:59.240 --> 44:12.290]  a patron, you will get it for free. People
[44:12.290 --> 44:16.310]  are making guesses and I will not confirm or deny
[44:16.310 --> 44:20.390]  how correct they are, but it will be a thing that we release
[44:20.390 --> 44:24.350]  for free for all our patrons at each tier. And we're also going to have it available
[44:24.350 --> 44:28.270]  in our shop for individual purchase if you're someone who doesn't
[44:28.270 --> 44:30.210]  want to be a patron but want to buy the cookbook.
[44:38.660 --> 44:42.140]  We don't have anything in our store, but Patreon, I guess, recently
[44:42.140 --> 44:46.320]  once again, I probably am not the most qualified to talk about it
[44:46.320 --> 44:50.300]  because I don't have a long history of Patreon, but I think they relatively recently implemented
[44:50.300 --> 44:54.040]  the ability to sell things via a store on your patron page.
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.020]  So we are going to be able to sell things
[44:58.020 --> 45:01.300]  through that if we want. And
[45:01.960 --> 45:04.820]  we will list the item.
[45:06.560 --> 45:10.260]  I almost said what it was. That was very close.
[45:10.260 --> 45:13.900]  We'll list the item that I'm teasing and not at all confirming what it is despite
[45:14.380 --> 45:17.080]  a lot of guesses on the store.
[45:22.470 --> 45:25.410]  Wait, did I say... I said it already?
[45:26.050 --> 45:28.610]  I suck at this. I am
[45:28.610 --> 45:32.070]  not allowed to tease things anymore. It took one question.
[45:33.470 --> 45:37.110]  That's phenomenal. Yeah, I'm never teasing
[45:37.110 --> 45:40.270]  again. That was the worst tease of all time.
[45:42.210 --> 45:44.430]  It's like playing Deal or No Deal with all the cases
[45:44.430 --> 45:45.890]  open. I'm like, which one do you want to pick?
[45:47.870 --> 45:49.470]  Well, the cookbook is coming next week.
[45:51.630 --> 45:56.350]  I don't think it matters if I say it. I don't know why it had to be teased. That's just a lot of weird
[45:56.350 --> 46:00.390]  decision making by me. But this is what happens when I'm playing a game
[46:00.390 --> 46:02.470]  and trying to conduct the stream at the same time.
[46:04.710 --> 46:08.210]  A salad cream tease would be like
[46:08.210 --> 46:11.790]  if it didn't come out next week. That would be it being salad creamed.
[46:11.850 --> 46:14.930]  If there was no release. I don't think I salad creamed it yet.
[46:15.670 --> 46:20.230]  A salad cream has to be like a negative. It's not just that you
[46:20.230 --> 46:24.330]  screwed it up. You made the situation worse because of the actions you did.
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.420]  I definitely alberted it.
[46:34.360 --> 46:35.080]  Ooh.
[46:38.120 --> 46:39.240]  Oh my god.
[46:39.820 --> 46:42.260]  Stop shooting me. I'm gonna shoot you.
[46:44.680 --> 46:45.400]  Yeah.
[46:46.720 --> 46:48.540]  Take that. Oh shit.
[46:50.820 --> 46:54.800]  Okay. Oh. Oh. Holy shit.
[46:55.340 --> 46:58.680]  Holy. They got Spider-Man on their team.
[46:58.680 --> 47:02.720]  What the fuck was that? Oh my god it was Batman.
[47:02.940 --> 47:06.660]  Never mind. Holy shit. I was joking.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.980]  They have a superhero. That's crazy.
[47:11.180 --> 47:15.060]  What are you? How did you learn to do that?
[47:16.080 --> 47:17.840]  Where did you come from?
[47:20.680 --> 47:21.820]  Bruce Wayne.
[47:22.520 --> 47:27.200]  That wasn't even Bruce Wayne. Who's teaching you guys all these moves?
[47:28.900 --> 47:31.040]  I'm gonna try this.
[47:32.420 --> 47:35.120]  I can jump here.
[47:37.320 --> 47:39.060]  Y'all are a problem.
[47:40.320 --> 47:42.900]  That's a problem. You guys deal with him.
[47:44.220 --> 47:45.560]  I could tell that was Batman.
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.180]  I'm not Batman. I am not Batman. Holy shit.
[47:51.960 --> 47:54.320]  Nope. That did not work in the slightest.
[47:55.900 --> 47:57.120]  I'm not even Robin.
[47:58.460 --> 48:01.940]  Whatever is a tier below... six tiers below Robin, I'm them.
[48:03.920 --> 48:05.600]  I'm like Baskin Robbins.
[48:06.620 --> 48:10.500]  Okay. We got health. We got a hammer.
[48:10.780 --> 48:13.120]  Let's just run down the middle. We don't need to be fancy.
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.080]  Oh you got health too? Never mind. I was gonna say
[48:18.080 --> 48:19.920]  it doesn't help. But it helped a lot.
[48:24.340 --> 48:26.060]  I don't even deserve to be on Wayne's
[48:26.060 --> 48:27.820]  premises. Like the office.
[48:30.200 --> 48:33.000]  Thankfully we got Baxel.
[48:35.660 --> 48:37.920]  Kay Satan is back as well. Kay Satan
[48:37.920 --> 48:38.900]  just murdered Batman.
[48:44.610 --> 48:45.570]  Saved my life.
[48:47.470 --> 48:50.270]  Never mind. That didn't save my life at all.
[48:50.950 --> 48:52.790]  You throw grenades into that thing?
[48:53.970 --> 48:57.870]  I feel like it kind of takes away the point of the bubble. Oh go. Go Baxel!
[48:58.670 --> 49:01.170]  Run! You've got this!
[49:01.790 --> 49:06.570]  We beat Batman! What a win!
[49:11.050 --> 49:12.350]  Yeah Nick is editing all the
[49:12.350 --> 49:15.350]  gameplay for us. Nick is editing everything. He's amazing.
[49:16.170 --> 49:19.930]  I love Nick. Completely unrelated to that. But he's just insanely talented.
[49:23.130 --> 49:23.490]  Heh.
[49:27.110 --> 49:29.150]  Who won? Kendrick or Dre? Is that even a question?
[49:30.170 --> 49:33.170]  That's not a question. Kendrick absolutely destroyed him.
[49:39.100 --> 49:39.420]  Yeah.
[49:41.560 --> 49:45.480]  This is obvious. This is not even. I don't understand how you can argue otherwise.
[49:46.740 --> 49:48.840]  Uh okay. What else we gotta do? We gotta win three.
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.400]  Why does it want me to win every match in the world? I'm not good at this.
[49:53.400 --> 49:56.420]  At least it's gonna make me do eight of them.
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.380]  Later. Um...
[50:02.940 --> 50:05.320]  I guess let's do another. See if we get
[50:05.320 --> 50:15.760]  gay Satan again. I just climbed.
[50:16.300 --> 50:20.160]  I'm a... I'm a fool. Is what I just
[50:20.160 --> 50:23.560]  realized. I apologize for how loud that cough was.
[50:23.880 --> 50:28.240]  I'm wearing two headsets right now. Cause I am streaming through my console.
[50:28.240 --> 50:31.180]  Cause I don't trust my streaming setup until Nick is available.
[50:31.780 --> 50:36.400]  So I'm wearing my Xbox headset. And that is what you're hearing me through. And I'm speaking into
[50:36.400 --> 50:40.320]  my podcast headset for the VOD. And every time I've coughed, I've
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.320]  like moved away from the mic. But I just realized I'm wearing
[50:44.320 --> 50:48.280]  the mic that you're hearing. So you're just hearing me cough into the mic.
[50:48.300 --> 50:52.440]  I am so sorry. I should mute. I will mute
[50:52.440 --> 50:53.120]  going forward.
[50:56.080 --> 50:57.980]  I'm like leaning all the way back.
[50:58.080 --> 51:02.440]  Being like, I'm being sneaky about it. And that is not
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.940]  at all the case. I am a mess today.
[51:06.220 --> 51:08.880]  Is what I am. Spoiling the cookbook.
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.340]  Coughing into the mic.
[51:17.680 --> 51:19.300]  I like this map. This is fun.
[51:20.340 --> 51:22.900]  Never mind. My opinions have lowered.
[51:25.760 --> 51:26.860]  Am I just
[51:26.860 --> 51:29.720]  perpetually sick? I've had this throat thing for like two minutes.
[51:31.560 --> 51:34.940]  Outside of that, no. This throat
[51:34.940 --> 51:37.380]  thing does not want to go away. It is real annoying.
[51:45.580 --> 51:48.640]  Get away! Get away! Get away! Get back!
[51:49.380 --> 51:49.620]  Ah!
[52:04.760 --> 52:05.720]  Stop him!
[52:07.900 --> 52:09.640]  I feel like I was dead for a long time.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.680]  Oh. Oh. Oh.
[52:15.240 --> 52:17.420]  Oh. Who killed? Oh, the pistol. Okay.
[52:18.320 --> 52:20.700]  I was gonna say, I feel like I definitely killed that person before they got me.
[52:31.120 --> 52:33.800]  Yeah, I'm not sure if I have like laryngitis or
[52:35.360 --> 52:37.160]  bronchitis or... GG to you.
[52:37.560 --> 52:41.920]  What sucks is from my research... I mean, you're right. I should really
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.720]  just book an appointment with my doctor. It'll take a while, though, to get there, but
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.180]  at least maybe get some clarity. It's annoying where it'll get
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.140]  better. It'll get like 98% better and then it will
[52:54.800 --> 52:56.400]  get all raspy again.
[52:58.380 --> 53:00.580]  But I should just get checked out for it.
[53:02.600 --> 53:05.760]  But from my research, because I am a qualified Google
[53:05.760 --> 53:09.960]  doctor, it sounds like it could be a thing that is just... you have
[53:09.960 --> 53:13.920]  to deal with. And then I'm sure with what I do and yelling
[53:13.920 --> 53:17.260]  a lot at games, because that's who I am,
[53:18.020 --> 53:25.040]  it's not helping. Drink honey?
[53:26.640 --> 53:28.400]  I should just... I should
[53:28.920 --> 53:33.060]  lean further into the Winnie the Pooh Bear thing. Just have honey
[53:33.060 --> 53:36.180]  in my desk. Just fist it into my mouth.
[53:38.360 --> 53:41.160]  Hot tea would probably be a great thing to have. I just never really
[53:41.600 --> 53:44.220]  got into tea outside of the iced variety.
[53:59.020 --> 54:00.340]  Now let's try to do a big team
[54:00.340 --> 54:00.620]  battle.
[54:04.180 --> 54:07.820]  Skip all that. Let's do a big team battle. I want to try to run somebody over the vehicle.
[54:09.080 --> 54:10.820]  And maybe we'll call the stream there.
[54:13.040 --> 54:14.940]  Not as much gameplay as I would like, but
[54:16.960 --> 54:20.140]  we'll be back again next week. I know Nick will be around.
[54:20.140 --> 54:23.400]  And I think we'll have a much fuller crew. We'll do something fun.
[54:25.200 --> 54:26.460]  Sheriff's holding up great.
[54:28.520 --> 54:31.860]  Andrew, are you the Winnie the Poohing right now just eating honey in a shirt?
[54:32.120 --> 54:35.320]  Ah, no. No, I don't have the honey.
[54:39.210 --> 54:41.370]  You have to be a bottomless or it won't help.
[54:43.350 --> 54:44.330]  That's just science.
[54:45.530 --> 54:49.530]  That's just the medical opinion. Not even
[54:49.530 --> 54:51.150]  medical opinion, medical fact.
[54:52.290 --> 54:56.430]  Sometimes I wish I could just shove high pressure warm water into all my orifices.
[54:56.930 --> 54:59.030]  I don't like that.
[55:07.050 --> 55:10.650]  Aw, thank you so much $5 shake. It's been a pleasure to spend this time with you.
[55:12.290 --> 55:15.070]  I knew a dude from a previous job that would eat Tostitos nachos
[55:15.070 --> 55:17.110]  out of a jar like Winnie the Pooh eats honey.
[55:19.370 --> 55:20.510]  What a character.
[55:26.230 --> 55:28.030]  Oh, easily the best chair I've ever owned.
[55:33.590 --> 55:34.690]  Hey, the colored gecko.
[55:37.070 --> 55:38.270]  Have a good day at work, Gigi Blue.
[55:46.730 --> 55:49.350]  What did Gavin text me? I forgot to check on that.
[55:55.890 --> 55:59.630]  Don't think I could do it unless it was really passive, like if it was falling off a cliff
[55:59.630 --> 56:01.690]  and I didn't help it. Maybe.
[56:04.310 --> 56:05.830]  He's saying he's against horse murder.
[56:08.930 --> 56:10.850]  Would you drink regulation alcohol?
[56:11.210 --> 56:11.950]  Probably not.
[56:14.170 --> 56:19.730]  I get congested when I consume alcohol a lot of the time. I think I might have an allergy to it.
[56:25.470 --> 56:27.830]  Have you played Helldivers? I haven't played Helldivers.
[56:27.990 --> 56:30.490]  I don't have a PlayStation, but it looks great.
[56:31.310 --> 56:35.890]  I know there were some controversy around it recently with them briefly
[56:35.890 --> 56:39.850]  forcing people to connect a PlayStation ID
[56:39.850 --> 56:44.190]  for the account, but outside of that, everything I've seen about that game looks like a ton of fun.
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.980]  I don't PC game at all.
[56:51.040 --> 56:52.840]  I only am on console.
[56:54.540 --> 56:59.180]  I honestly forgot Helldivers 2 is even available on PC as well.
[57:04.060 --> 57:04.840]  Just getting the warthog.
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.080]  This is not an ideal splatter vehicle, but we can make it work.
[57:10.100 --> 57:12.140]  I think it's honestly better than the
[57:14.520 --> 57:15.080]  chopper.
[57:18.340 --> 57:19.500]  I'll take the chopper.
[57:20.060 --> 57:22.860]  I feel bad about wasting a warthog in that way.
[57:23.900 --> 57:28.280]  Chopper is just a disaster. Oh, a ghost is the ideal vehicle for this.
[57:32.420 --> 57:34.060]  Let's see if we can sneak around.
[57:35.040 --> 57:37.800]  Oh! Yeah! There we go. That was easy.
[57:38.300 --> 57:42.300]  I'll just play normally. Got the splatter out of the way.
[57:47.020 --> 57:49.280]  Yeah, I like the chopper a lot in design.
[57:49.540 --> 57:53.560]  I'm really bad at using it, so maybe it's a lot better than I think it is.
[57:53.660 --> 57:56.760]  It's just me sucking, but I
[57:56.760 --> 57:58.180]  struggle with it in this game.
[58:07.700 --> 58:10.060]  Oh my god. How am I alive?
[58:10.200 --> 58:12.680]  How did I not die? That was ridiculous.
[58:19.260 --> 58:20.480]  What do we got?
[58:20.480 --> 58:21.320]  What do we got?
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.880]  Is that Batman again flying around? Get back here.
[58:29.840 --> 58:30.800]  Edgar Bear.
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.100]  I want a Batman! Fuuuuck!
[58:43.060 --> 58:43.940]  Yeah, sorry
[58:43.940 --> 58:48.120]  Voltage Viking. Don't feel bad about it though. There's nothing wrong with comet leaving,
[58:48.260 --> 58:50.240]  but you are absolutely a comet leaver.
[59:01.530 --> 59:04.030]  It is weird to think about that there are people that are
[59:04.030 --> 59:07.930]  listening or watching the stream that are
[59:07.930 --> 59:11.430]  adamant will never be comet leavers for whatever reason.
[59:11.730 --> 59:14.890]  It's your choice. I respect that. You don't have to comet leave.
[59:15.670 --> 59:19.810]  But there are definitely people... I wonder if anyone has
[59:19.810 --> 59:23.770]  witnessed all of these streams and have remained
[59:23.770 --> 59:24.630]  a comet leaver.
[59:27.530 --> 59:28.670]  Is Lee Ken saying
[59:28.670 --> 59:32.990]  we all suck? Or is he on the other team? Or was that the last game?
[59:33.890 --> 59:34.770]  I just noticed that.
[59:41.110 --> 59:44.570]  A million dollars but you can only play on PC from now on? Yeah, that's fine.
[59:46.890 --> 59:49.150]  Somebody who primarily plays on
[59:49.150 --> 59:52.990]  Xbox. All of their first party I think
[59:52.990 --> 59:56.850]  is PC based. I'm sure there are exceptions,
[59:56.850 --> 01:00:00.070]  but I know generally speaking they try to release both.
[01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:04.650]  Game Pass Ultimate exists. It would be pretty easy for me to switch to PC.
[01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.150]  I struggle with the technical barriers
[01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:12.990]  of making things work and troubleshooting and then some days it just
[01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:15.190]  doesn't work and it did the previous.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:20.310]  I like the simplicity of a console just making a game.
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.510]  But for how
[01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.590]  Steam has developed on the other game
[01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:31.530]  stores and just PC gaming in general, especially on the indie scene,
[01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.150]  absolutely is probably the best place to play.
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:40.590]  Andrew, with the Fall Guys community event, you did
[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:44.410]  be a VOD. I was Sonic in that stream. It was supposed
[01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:48.370]  to be, but we had issues with
[01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:52.450]  the video. So that unfortunately did not make it
[01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:56.810]  as a VOD. My recording got screwed up.
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.570]  So unless you were there, you missed it, we are going
[01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.870]  to try to solve that so it doesn't happen again.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.380]  It's also a great point of you can always
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.900]  just plug in a controller to a PC.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.530]  Okay, not bad. 6 and 7.
[01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:25.810]  Almost 50-50.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:32.970]  Let's see what else we can get into.
[01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:35.570]  I mean, a win would be huge.
[01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:37.850]  We're not that far behind.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.320]  Always feels good to get an assist.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.600]  I screwed that up.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:57.760]  How do you think a horse would, if given a chance, buy a Herman Miller chair?
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.120]  I think a horse would rather have a Herman Miller chair.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.780]  What is a sensible horse?
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.860]  I don't think anyone needs a horse reaction channel.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.620]  I don't think anyone needs a horse reaction channel.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.760]  Like Mr. Ed watching Mr. Ed.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.420]  I'm kind of into that.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.800]  We do a community event
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.880]  at the Falcon Tier and above on our Patreon.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.320]  We did a Fall Guys Night.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:46.280]  We do one a month of those events.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.240]  The first one we did was a Fall Guys Night.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.460]  I recorded it, but I lost the footage or the footage broke.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.420]  The plan was to release that as VOD later, but that will not be the case.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.760]  That was the event. We don't have the next one
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.760]  scheduled currently. It will be in this upcoming month.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.500]  When we do, you will
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.860]  learn more about it on our Patreon page.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.840]  Andrew's hiding his losses. I had two wins!
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.380]  One legitimate. It wasn't all losing.
[01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:34.310]  Fuck!
[01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:40.090]  Oh wow, that guy is Diamond. He's about to be
[01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:42.610]  Onyx last tier.
[01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.530]  We're not doing good. And I blame me.
[01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:51.090]  I feel like since I called out a win would be nice, the play has really dropped off.
[01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:52.930]  On my end especially.
[01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:58.630]  I feel like I helped at least.
[01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:01.030]  Another assist! Yeah!
[01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:05.230]  Third assist!
[01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:08.230]  Racking up those assists!
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.220]  Do not allow what?
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.440]  They're about to win or something?
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.860]  Give me a person.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.540]  Damn it, not even an assist on that.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.920]  Go for you, go for you.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:44.940]  If you were a little taller...
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.080]  Get away, get away, get away.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.800]  Okay, health recharge.
[01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.950]  Oh, let me in, let me in.
[01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:00.970]  How do I get up there?
[01:05:03.250 --> 01:05:05.430]  Coming! Oh, never mind.
[01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.970]  Over there? I see him.
[01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.770]  He's got rockets. Gotta stop him.
[01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:18.410]  He got destroyed!
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:20.110]  Jesus!
[01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:25.190]  Where did the rockets go?
[01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.490]  I think we found them based on that noise.
[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:31.570]  Yeah, okay, he got them.
[01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:33.990]  As long as they don't have them.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.140]  That is how that went for that guy.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:52.380]  Is how it goes for me and the chopper 98% of the time.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.260]  That is why I don't use them.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.040]  I am bad.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.180]  Turn this into a fight at the end.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.080]  Wow, never mind.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.760]  You got this!
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.640]  Defeat!
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.100]  Well, that'll be our last game for now.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.640]  Oh, gg. Bottom half sucks, go play COD.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.260]  It's only game!
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.200]  Why are you so mad?
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.080]  We got this ladder, that's a win.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.280]  Anyone have any questions?
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.120]  Exactly, why do you have to be mad?
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.080]  It's only game.
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.020]  Any idea when the next draft is releasing?
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.400]  Thank you so much, we need to record more.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.980]  We don't have any in the can right now, but we have so many we want to do.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.940]  It's just about finding that time.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:11.640]  We've been figuring stuff out and getting our RSS feed and the IP sorted out.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.220]  Once we have all of our systems in place.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.840]  Pretty much, I want to say, we are at that level.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:24.040]  We'll be able to pump out more content and grow and do all that fun stuff.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.180]  Andrew, your villain draft picks were top.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.260]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.180]  We are doing a summer movie auction.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.760]  It's a game I played with my friends for years.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.960]  Where we have an auction draft of all the summer movies that are going to release.
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.480]  We recorded it a few weeks ago, so some of them are out already.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.620]  That will be available Sunday, I want to say.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.960]  I think it's great.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.540]  The guys really had a lot of fun with it.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:02.960]  It is an auction that has never played out the way it did in all the years I've done it with my friends.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.000]  It has never played out the way it did with the regulation crew.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:09.880]  Which is fun.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.800]  And I hope you really like it.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.660]  It's a thing that we can do more of than is sort of a format that we can definitely work more with.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.020]  So please let us know if you like it.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.600]  Anything else you can tease? No, nothing else I can tease.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.880]  Do you guys have a preference when it comes to party games you like to play?
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.640]  Party games you like to play?
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.620]  I really like party animals. I don't play that as much.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.200]  Have you been settling into your role as secretary? I've been trying.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.040]  It's been a lot for everyone. A lot of work.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.320]  But I feel like we're getting there.
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:47.520]  Will that be on YouTube or Patreon only? That will be everywhere.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:51.980]  That is completely free. It will be on all the audio feeds.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:55.460]  Wherever you seek our content, it will be there.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.760]  Will you do a Survivor draft for the next season? That could be a lot of fun.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:06.060]  I didn't watch Survivor the last season. I kind of fell out of it.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.200]  But I heard that the next Survivor Australia season
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.240]  is going to be American vs Australian.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.460]  And returning players. That would interest me.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.700]  But we'll see. That's a fun idea though.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.720]  Can we have a draft draft? We need to do enough drafts.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.260]  I don't think we've done enough yet to do that.
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.740]  Oh yeah, that would be a lot of fun.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.760]  Famous horse draft.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.040]  Famous horse draft and then side draft of how many of these horses Gavin would willingly kill.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.000]  What were you saying about multi-cam videos?
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.680]  A lot of the Let's Plays we've recorded are games that are single cam.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.280]  Largely. Or it's me playing a game
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.320]  and then sharing the screen. We have some other content in that way.
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.940]  We need to figure out our editing situation on that.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:11.760]  Which I'm hoping we will be able to do soon.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.140]  Any plans to travel for the US content now that you are a part owner?
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.560]  No. Not any plans currently.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.900]  About draft or drafts that are done.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.600]  Oh! Drafting other drafts. That's funny.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.280]  I'd have to look into that.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.900]  I'll think about that. I'll explore that.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.620]  Nick is killing it. He's doing so good.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.560]  Video game draft would be a lot of fun.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:46.440]  Trucks? Yes. Haven't played trucks recently. Would love to get back into it.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.140]  I think Geoff is craving some trucks.
[01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.210]  No, not even for Beanhole Days. I'm going to be honest.
[01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:02.330]  Once Beanhole Days was described to me, the attractions, I'm not that excited about Beanhole Days.
[01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.330]  A TikTok draft is interesting.
[01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:09.290]  I could speak, it would be even better.
[01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:15.210]  Are the VODs of those special events going to be for everyone or only Falcons and Up?
[01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.850]  That's a fantastic question. We haven't talked about that.
[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:22.990]  I could see it being for Falcons and Up and then maybe
[01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:27.510]  Clips. It being like taking some highlights from that and then having that be
[01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:29.270]  for everyone.
[01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:32.910]  Any more competition plans like Fuck Face Off or March
[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.350]  Madness Trivia?
[01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.890]  We'd love to do more Fuck Face Off. There's nothing
[01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:43.270]  in the works for that at the moment.
[01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:45.470]  What's your favorite game?
[01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.850]  What Remains of Edith Finch is my favorite game.
[01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:55.330]  Thank you, Crack and Meat, for being a first time chatter.
[01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:57.470]  Potentially a first time comment leaver.
[01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.550]  I'm not going to line up on a merchandise distributor yet.
[01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:07.450]  We're all killing it right now. I've been having a rough time in my personal life
[01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:11.410]  recently. Thank you so much, Trickster. I hope that things
[01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:15.350]  turn around for you soon. Have you listened to Morning Somewhere? Will you be one of their possible guests?
[01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:19.450]  They have, I believe Bernie has mentioned, considered having you on before. That's very kind of Bernie.
[01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.650]  Love Bernie.
[01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:26.770]  There's some time people expect so much.
[01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:29.810]  We're working on it. All the stuff where people are like,
[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.730]  have you figured this out? Are all things that we're excited about as well.
[01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.770]  And we appreciate the enthusiasm for it.
[01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:40.250]  And we appreciate your patience as well.
[01:12:41.410 --> 01:12:45.070]  I was just about to start playing some Halo as well. Awesome. Well, you have fun. You take the lead.
[01:12:45.190 --> 01:12:48.890]  You look out for Batman though. He's grappling, hooking, doing all that stuff.
[01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:51.770]  Do you still own Not The Rooster Teeth Store.com? I do not.
[01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.890]  Can you convince Geoff to do a haunted amusement park haunted house?
[01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:00.970]  I don't know about that, but I would love to get some
[01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.770]  and scare Geoff content as well.
[01:13:04.910 --> 01:13:08.430]  Who are you going to raid? I don't know how to raid is the answer to that. So nobody.
[01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:12.910]  But I would love to raid like Larry or Matt. Go check out
[01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:17.030]  Larry. I don't think he's streaming right now, but Larry streams and they're
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:19.450]  great. Matt streams. He's great. Love Matt.
[01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:23.690]  Just go watch somebody that's great, I guess.
[01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.450]  Have you eaten the pencil? Never. Matt is streaming.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.020]  Matt and Ray are live. Ray is also wonderful.
[01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:43.830]  I don't... if I dodged... did I dodge your question? I didn't mean to dodge
[01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:47.790]  your question. Hearts... heart sword
[01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:54.990]  or heart's word? Long time
[01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.410]  Will we see more RayGastron Food Slice
[01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:03.450]  items besides the bagel and sandwich? I would love that.
[01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.490]  That'd be cool.
[01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:10.310]  Matt is also a great streamer. People should check him out. I don't know about that.
[01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:15.170]  I'd actually say otherwise. Do you have a coin collection? What's your favorite
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.970]  coin? I do have a coin collection. I don't have a favorite coin.
[01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:22.790]  I have some quarters
[01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:27.150]  from like 1898.
[01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:30.970]  I have some old coins that were
[01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:34.970]  I inherited within the last year
[01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:38.990]  or so. I don't think I'd ever necessarily
[01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:43.170]  get into coin collecting otherwise, but it is really cool to hold a physical item like that
[01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:46.930]  that's been around a long time and thinking about all the history and different people
[01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:51.030]  it would have touched. Will chatting on stream make us comment leavers? Yes.
[01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:54.310]  I'll do like five more questions.
[01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:02.970]  Would you do a show and tell of coins?
[01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:07.630]  I'm not opposed. Who was the biggest help
[01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:10.270]  in you guys figuring out what to do post RT?
[01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.470]  Tina was a huge help.
[01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:19.610]  Tina, I know, hooked us up with some
[01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:23.850]  stuff that definitely was huge for us. On the company side
[01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.950]  Jordan and Hannah and there are a lot of people that helped
[01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:35.540]  us. Am I going to get in trouble for the cookbook
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.040]  thing? No, I'm just a fool. I won't get in trouble. I'm just dumb.
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:45.470]  Thank you so much
[01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:49.590]  Snowberry Nugs. I'm glad you enjoyed
[01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:52.350]  the Punisher villain clip. It's a dumb movie.
[01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:55.210]  I would like to rewatch.
[01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:59.290]  Who do you think is winning the NBA finals? It's going to be the
[01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:02.990]  Boston Celtics by far. Easily. Boston's going to get that win.
[01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.410]  They deserve it. It's been a long time coming.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.740]  A last question.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:20.320]  What do we got? Who wants it? Who wants to claim?
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:24.940]  How you doing?
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.200]  Is the last question. I'm doing pretty good. I'm a little tired.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.080]  But this was a lot of fun. Thank you so much for joining me. We will have
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.400]  much more of the crew next week. It will be a better setup.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:41.280]  I'm amazed that this didn't light on fire. We appreciate you
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.600]  all so much for the support and for checking us out.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:49.260]  If you just have stumbled onto this, please check out our Patreon. We have tons
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.860]  of content there. Just thank you.
[01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:57.220]  I hope you all have an amazing weekend. If you are
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:01.140]  working a job, that Saturday and Sunday is your weekend. And if not,
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.540]  I hope that you have an amazing rest of your work week.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.500]  Thank you so much for joining me. This was
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:13.380]  a lot of fun. I love you all so much. I will talk to you soon.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.300]  Enjoy the Let's Play tomorrow and the auction. Please let us
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.200]  know what you think of the auction format on Sunday. Talk to you all
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.060]  later. Bye!
