[00:00.000 --> 00:03.880]  Hello everyone, and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:03.960 --> 00:07.880]  Today, we are going to take the new Call of Duty for a spin.
[00:08.060 --> 00:12.200]  Andrew recommended that we do this last week, and then today, suddenly nobody seemed to
[00:12.200 --> 00:15.520]  particularly want to do it or know what we're doing, so we're just going to play a little bit of Team Deathmatch.
[00:15.640 --> 00:19.740]  I brought up some zombies, some multiplayer. I got one eye. I'm ready to kill people.
[00:20.740 --> 00:21.520]  I can do zombies.
[00:21.920 --> 00:22.640]  I got one eye.
[00:23.040 --> 00:25.900]  We can't do zombies because there's five of us, but...
[00:25.900 --> 00:27.860]  Why do you have one eye?
[00:28.020 --> 00:29.600]  My character, I don't know what happened to him.
[00:29.600 --> 00:30.560]  He's got an eye patch.
[00:31.120 --> 00:35.260]  Unless there's a twist and he has two functioning eyes, and he's playing.
[00:35.600 --> 00:36.200]  He's doing a bit.
[00:36.500 --> 00:38.080]  It's decorative, like pro wrestling.
[00:38.740 --> 00:42.380]  So nobody has played Call of Duty multiplayer yet.
[00:42.480 --> 00:45.160]  Has anybody played any of the other game types, Warzone or anything?
[00:45.940 --> 00:46.420]  No.
[00:47.260 --> 00:49.280]  I have to figure out how to mute the other people.
[00:49.540 --> 00:50.300]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:50.820 --> 00:51.760]  Oh, how do we...
[00:52.960 --> 00:54.400]  Proximity chat off.
[00:55.200 --> 00:55.600]  Friends.
[00:56.900 --> 01:00.700]  You hit left trigger and then just go down to friends and channels.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.840]  Yeah, I just have it to friends only.
[01:03.840 --> 01:05.920]  I mean, you can do friends only, party only, whatever.
[01:07.420 --> 01:07.820]  Perfect.
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.560]  They're talking about something about a taxidermist.
[01:11.060 --> 01:15.840]  I don't want to hear what Dino Taco Nuggies has to say, dude.
[01:16.000 --> 01:16.960]  That's all I want to hear.
[01:17.060 --> 01:19.300]  But I do want to hear what Spider Nut has to say.
[01:19.520 --> 01:20.660]  What about Tiny Dancer?
[01:21.280 --> 01:22.960]  I wonder what crossplay...
[01:22.960 --> 01:25.940]  Particular insight Spider Nut would have.
[01:26.140 --> 01:26.800]  Yeah, I believe it is.
[01:26.840 --> 01:28.680]  Are we playing against people who use mouse and keyboard?
[01:29.040 --> 01:29.400]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29.440 --> 01:30.940]  You can see the icon what they're using.
[01:31.300 --> 01:33.020]  What the... that's not good.
[01:33.440 --> 01:33.940]  That's bad.
[01:34.100 --> 01:34.600]  Modern multiplayer.
[01:35.240 --> 01:39.780]  You can also use a mouse and keyboard on the Xbox, I think now.
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.140]  This is going to be the most embarrassing Let's Play we've ever made.
[01:43.340 --> 01:43.720]  No.
[01:45.100 --> 01:47.620]  No, we've made some very embarrassing Let's Plays.
[01:47.620 --> 01:48.480]  Surely not.
[01:48.840 --> 01:51.340]  Let's have the editor cut away every time one of us is bad.
[01:52.000 --> 01:52.800]  Oh, boy.
[01:52.900 --> 01:53.760]  There's going to be no footage.
[01:55.280 --> 01:56.640]  Oh, nice dive.
[01:56.780 --> 01:57.680]  This is going to be good.
[01:58.480 --> 02:00.340]  This game's all about dolphin dives.
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.240]  All of the movement is weird and you can't like...
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.360]  Nothing is color-based.
[02:05.560 --> 02:07.980]  It's all... it's all based on movement.
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.200]  And that's what makes it hard.
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.740]  This is set in 1991.
[02:13.080 --> 02:13.740]  I wonder what I was doing.
[02:15.340 --> 02:16.300]  Well, what were you doing?
[02:16.460 --> 02:17.660]  Well, you would know.
[02:18.280 --> 02:19.820]  You think it was one of the last times you set your pants?
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.580]  You set that drooling.
[02:20.580 --> 02:21.380]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[02:21.940 --> 02:22.680]  Here we go.
[02:24.200 --> 02:24.340]  Up there.
[02:24.640 --> 02:25.100]  Andrew's dead.
[02:25.860 --> 02:26.320]  Where they at, Nick?
[02:26.520 --> 02:29.120]  You can ping with the... up on the D-pad.
[02:29.280 --> 02:29.680]  I just did.
[02:30.560 --> 02:31.380]  I'm never going to ping.
[02:31.680 --> 02:33.540]  I'm never going to be alive enough to ping.
[02:34.140 --> 02:36.200]  I haven't seen... I saw one person.
[02:36.740 --> 02:38.120]  I haven't seen an enemy at all.
[02:38.240 --> 02:38.760]  I'm with you, Nick.
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.040]  Come on, man. Let's go.
[02:40.260 --> 02:41.720]  Follow me to Glory.
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.120]  Oh, shit.
[02:44.180 --> 02:44.680]  Oh, fuck.
[02:44.860 --> 02:45.380]  Behind the tunnel.
[02:45.420 --> 02:46.300]  In the tunnel right there, Gavin.
[02:46.560 --> 02:47.000]  In the tunnel?
[02:48.420 --> 02:49.240]  Down below us?
[02:49.480 --> 02:49.720]  Where?
[02:49.720 --> 02:52.780]  That was a rough time to realize my gun was single shot, not automatic.
[02:52.900 --> 02:53.480]  Holy shit.
[02:53.860 --> 02:55.920]  I shot him once in the butt, and then I looked at him.
[02:56.020 --> 02:56.940]  How do you change it?
[02:57.100 --> 02:58.160]  You can switch it.
[02:58.260 --> 03:00.180]  Left on the D-pad, I believe, if your gun has it.
[03:00.240 --> 03:00.980]  It's below your ammo.
[03:01.120 --> 03:02.480]  It'll say what your fire modes are.
[03:02.660 --> 03:03.120]  Yep, that's it.
[03:03.520 --> 03:04.800]  I have not seen an enemy.
[03:05.320 --> 03:05.580]  Where are the...
[03:05.580 --> 03:06.160]  I avenged you, Nick.
[03:06.160 --> 03:07.600]  I died once, and they all vanished.
[03:07.780 --> 03:10.180]  I've seen Nick... I've seen Nick five times.
[03:10.760 --> 03:11.180]  What's up, man?
[03:11.860 --> 03:12.480]  Nick's everywhere.
[03:12.880 --> 03:14.020]  He won't stop moving. It's great.
[03:14.600 --> 03:16.620]  Is our reputation getting out there?
[03:16.680 --> 03:18.360]  Nobody wants to actually fight us.
[03:18.620 --> 03:19.060]  Very high...
[03:19.060 --> 03:20.640]  Oh, I found a guy.
[03:21.840 --> 03:23.040]  I just pinged where they're at.
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.380]  Oh, I just murdered him.
[03:26.240 --> 03:26.640]  Is he upstairs?
[03:27.020 --> 03:29.480]  I was in turn murdered on the far right of the map.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.100]  I'm on the board.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.560]  Far right of the map.
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.340]  I don't know what that means.
[03:32.880 --> 03:34.060]  Oh, in the tunnel, in the tunnel.
[03:35.140 --> 03:36.000]  Yeah, they like to...
[03:36.000 --> 03:36.540]  Oh, I know where the tunnel is.
[03:36.700 --> 03:37.760]  They like to hang out in the tunnel.
[03:41.300 --> 03:42.020]  Frag kill.
[03:42.780 --> 03:43.020]  Nice.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.600]  0 for 2.
[03:45.960 --> 03:47.820]  Yeah, I'm not doing great.
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.200]  0 for 3.
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.100]  Oh, already?
[03:52.440 --> 03:52.660]  Damn.
[03:53.260 --> 03:54.060]  Did you spawn to die?
[03:54.900 --> 03:56.580]  Uh, yeah, I immediately saw somebody.
[03:57.360 --> 03:58.040]  Which was great.
[03:58.740 --> 04:00.740]  I'd rather that than not find anyone.
[04:01.560 --> 04:01.820]  Oh.
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.440]  0 for 4.
[04:03.880 --> 04:05.420]  Nick, we're not even close to the action.
[04:05.900 --> 04:06.560]  What is happening?
[04:06.560 --> 04:08.720]  Oh, Andrew Panton Halo guy.
[04:09.560 --> 04:10.300]  Pick it up.
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.860]  I was never a Call of Duty guy for multiplayer.
[04:12.960 --> 04:13.540]  Halo is better.
[04:13.580 --> 04:14.300]  That's the same thing.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.680]  Right trigger shoots.
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.660]  Nah, I've always felt different.
[04:18.220 --> 04:20.380]  I don't know how to play this game.
[04:20.900 --> 04:24.980]  I don't know how to play this game not stoned in my roommate's bedroom.
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.080]  Well, get stoned in your roommate's bedroom.
[04:28.180 --> 04:28.560]  I don't know.
[04:28.800 --> 04:29.720]  Ian, where are you?
[04:30.680 --> 04:31.700]  He's looking up.
[04:35.300 --> 04:35.740]  Geoff.
[04:37.180 --> 04:38.880]  Why don't we stick together as a bad team?
[04:40.280 --> 04:40.920]  Thank you.
[04:42.460 --> 04:43.240]  I'm with Geoff.
[04:43.360 --> 04:44.780]  Oh, Eric, Eric in the...
[04:44.780 --> 04:45.680]  Got... oh, I saw him.
[04:47.360 --> 04:48.080]  Oh, he's dead.
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.160]  Okay, it's good to know that X just means you can skip the kill cam and get back in.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.580]  Oh, Jesus, you scared me.
[04:54.540 --> 04:56.500]  Geoff avenged me when Schmeet killed me.
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.120]  Schmeet?
[04:57.960 --> 04:58.760]  Nah, he got me too.
[04:58.780 --> 04:59.400]  Oh, hi, Nick, sorry.
[04:59.560 --> 05:00.640]  Oh, shit, right behind you, Geoff.
[05:00.740 --> 05:01.280]  He's coming in.
[05:01.920 --> 05:02.720]  Oh, I'm coming to you guys.
[05:03.040 --> 05:03.640]  Oh, shit.
[05:04.100 --> 05:05.240]  Spotted up with the triple.
[05:06.540 --> 05:07.920]  Dude, Schmeet's going crazy.
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.860]  All right, now that you guys have played for a second,
[05:10.980 --> 05:13.820]  if you hit right bumper and left bumper, you have some sort of an ability.
[05:14.120 --> 05:14.260]  Goddamn.
[05:14.260 --> 05:16.120]  Yeah, I chucked a laptop on the ground or something.
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.860]  It's probably ammo for, I think, if you start out.
[05:19.280 --> 05:19.560]  Okay.
[05:20.660 --> 05:21.520]  Oh, God, it's you.
[05:21.620 --> 05:25.220]  Left bumper is your, like, concussion or flashbang.
[05:25.380 --> 05:26.440]  Right bumper is your...
[05:26.440 --> 05:26.820]  Got one guy.
[05:27.520 --> 05:28.520]  Gonna be your kill grenade.
[05:28.760 --> 05:29.920]  Oh, that's just the other guy on our team.
[05:30.380 --> 05:31.100]  I keep shooting at him.
[05:31.100 --> 05:34.980]  These games have always made me feel like a nameless henchman in an action movie.
[05:35.300 --> 05:35.920]  It's just die.
[05:36.340 --> 05:37.060]  Just run and die.
[05:37.500 --> 05:39.620]  This is... they really distilled...
[05:41.180 --> 05:41.740]  Oh, shit.
[05:41.740 --> 05:46.440]  They really distilled, like, an arcade game into a home console.
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.460]  It's like, oh, dying does not matter at all.
[05:48.460 --> 05:50.200]  How did that guy fucking kill me?
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.820]  How did that guy fucking kill me?
[05:53.540 --> 05:54.300]  Fuck me.
[05:54.640 --> 05:55.060]  Is this a grenade?
[05:55.280 --> 05:55.840]  Hell yeah.
[05:57.160 --> 05:57.600]  Nice.
[05:58.740 --> 05:59.840]  That was awesome.
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.140]  Oh, I got a spring mine kill.
[06:02.600 --> 06:03.420]  Let's eat my butt.
[06:03.580 --> 06:04.020]  God, I...
[06:04.020 --> 06:05.300]  Geoff with the equipment kills.
[06:05.520 --> 06:06.000]  Holy shit.
[06:06.300 --> 06:07.260]  Fuck me, I just spawned.
[06:07.680 --> 06:11.500]  I played long enough this morning to unlock loadouts, just so that I could...
[06:11.500 --> 06:12.640]  Now that's a move.
[06:12.740 --> 06:13.200]  ...have some loadouts.
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.120]  Oh, boy.
[06:14.300 --> 06:16.020]  It took about 18 minutes.
[06:16.240 --> 06:18.000]  I played the training thing, and that was it.
[06:18.220 --> 06:18.920]  I did nothing.
[06:18.980 --> 06:19.580]  I did that as well.
[06:20.000 --> 06:20.160]  Yeah.
[06:22.120 --> 06:24.820]  Training's like, hey, man, we really give a shit about dives this year.
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.480]  Yeah, dude, that...
[06:25.480 --> 06:26.660]  I don't know why, but it's all about it.
[06:27.980 --> 06:32.680]  It was so annoying when you had to, like, jump off the fucking building and turn around and shoot the guy.
[06:33.080 --> 06:35.860]  Well, I thought I had to do it in midair, and you don't.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.460]  It's just like, oh, land and shoot him.
[06:38.140 --> 06:39.100]  It's so stupid.
[06:39.380 --> 06:40.340]  It's so stupid.
[06:42.460 --> 06:44.200]  I remember being better at this.
[06:45.520 --> 06:46.280]  I don't.
[06:46.680 --> 06:50.140]  As you said that, I looked at the stats and saw your KD is 0.25.
[06:50.720 --> 06:50.860]  Yep.
[06:51.360 --> 06:51.740]  It's bad.
[06:51.940 --> 06:59.340]  I had nothing for the podcast today, so I made a bunch of merch to show you guys.
[06:59.340 --> 06:59.540]  Ooh.
[07:00.020 --> 07:00.280]  Those examples.
[07:01.180 --> 07:04.200]  I can't get more than one kill without getting a kill kill.
[07:05.260 --> 07:05.860]  A kill killed?
[07:07.160 --> 07:08.400]  I can't get a kill.
[07:09.740 --> 07:10.000]  Oh.
[07:12.300 --> 07:13.160]  I've been level 2.
[07:15.580 --> 07:17.800]  I'm having a day.
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.320]  And it just started.
[07:20.660 --> 07:21.540]  A shit day.
[07:21.740 --> 07:22.380]  Just a shit.
[07:22.560 --> 07:23.180]  Everything's shit.
[07:23.640 --> 07:25.520]  And I'm getting annihilated in this game.
[07:25.880 --> 07:30.040]  It started out, I took my kid to school, didn't bring his water bottle, had to drive back home,
[07:30.200 --> 07:34.820]  take the water bottle back, took the dogs for a walk, didn't bring a bag with me,
[07:35.040 --> 07:38.660]  dog took a shit, had to walk home, get a bag, go back, pick up the shit.
[07:39.560 --> 07:41.660]  I thought you were going to say you forgot your dog.
[07:42.940 --> 07:46.080]  Took a dog for a walk, got halfway, didn't have the dog, had to go back, get the dog.
[07:46.360 --> 07:47.480]  I had no idea where he was.
[07:47.560 --> 07:48.100]  Forgot the dog.
[07:48.260 --> 07:48.860]  Was just, can't remember.
[07:48.980 --> 07:50.080]  Just dragging the shit around.
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.560]  Started the walk with a dog.
[07:54.060 --> 07:56.440]  My neighbor walked up and said, why are you walking a bag of shit?
[07:56.560 --> 07:57.340]  And I said, oh no!
[07:57.700 --> 07:58.020]  Marshall!
[08:00.740 --> 08:02.840]  Realized I accidentally put my dog in the garbage can.
[08:04.840 --> 08:05.160]  Shit.
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.180]  That was some teamwork.
[08:07.180 --> 08:09.460]  We're all stacked up on each other's arseholes there.
[08:10.580 --> 08:12.020]  I'm doing the, I'm doing download.
[08:12.500 --> 08:14.780]  I get why streamers play this.
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.480]  I think playing this for more than an hour would be the most insane way to spend your time.
[08:21.060 --> 08:22.460]  This is crazy.
[08:23.040 --> 08:25.820]  This is, Call of Duty for me is a 30 minute game.
[08:26.120 --> 08:28.660]  You play two matches, maybe three, and then you call it.
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.180]  I was never a multiplayer guy, but Warzone and Zombies, so much fun.
[08:33.300 --> 08:35.840]  Right, see, I don't know anything, I don't know anything about those.
[08:35.860 --> 08:36.680]  Totally different animals.
[08:36.680 --> 08:38.840]  Can we play Zombies after this instead of this?
[08:39.620 --> 08:40.220]  Yeah, of course.
[08:40.420 --> 08:44.920]  I remember Jack always had an absolute hard on for Zombies, but I never really understood it.
[08:45.000 --> 08:45.460]  I didn't either.
[08:46.740 --> 08:48.140]  It's fine, it's okay.
[08:48.420 --> 08:52.180]  It's only four player, so somebody, I'll sit out.
[08:53.060 --> 08:56.200]  I'm not a big Zombies fan, so I'm happy to sit out.
[08:57.040 --> 08:57.920]  I'll watch you guys play.
[08:58.060 --> 09:01.900]  Yeah, didn't you play with Burndog like a bunch of nights, but you weren't that into it?
[09:02.440 --> 09:05.900]  Yeah, I was just playing to hang out with them, and so I ended up doing
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.920]  hundreds of hours of Zombies, and I was just kind of like, okay with it.
[09:10.520 --> 09:11.520]  Oh, okay, so...
[09:12.720 --> 09:13.780]  Warzone was always my jam.
[09:13.900 --> 09:16.700]  So, melee kills are just, hit them with the buddy or gun?
[09:17.460 --> 09:18.060]  It's not...
[09:18.060 --> 09:18.940]  Fucking suck shit.
[09:19.240 --> 09:19.760]  Okay, whatever.
[09:19.760 --> 09:20.500]  As opposed to what?
[09:20.720 --> 09:21.400]  Using a knife?
[09:22.980 --> 09:24.880]  If you hold it, you assassinate them.
[09:25.260 --> 09:27.340]  I mean, I feel like the original melee was hitting them with the gun.
[09:27.740 --> 09:28.680]  It was always hitting them with the gun.
[09:29.040 --> 09:29.400]  Was it?
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.640]  Why do I remember a knife?
[09:30.660 --> 09:31.240]  What was the knife?
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.440]  I mean, they introduced knives.
[09:32.460 --> 09:37.080]  You could grab knives as weapons, but like as your default melee, it's been the gun.
[09:37.360 --> 09:37.500]  Huh.
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.080]  Dude, you bloodied that guy's butt.
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.040]  He's got a blood butt.
[09:40.440 --> 09:40.900]  Blood butt?
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.220]  Oh, that's unfortunate.
[09:42.720 --> 09:43.760]  That guy's got a blood cock.
[09:44.980 --> 09:45.320]  Ow.
[09:46.040 --> 09:46.780]  Damn shit.
[09:47.640 --> 09:48.820]  I had scorpions and...
[09:48.820 --> 09:50.680]  Yeah, I hit my goal hitting one.
[09:50.920 --> 09:51.960]  That was rough.
[09:52.180 --> 09:55.860]  I feel like the next game, we've got it.
[09:57.840 --> 09:58.120]  Yeah.
[09:58.740 --> 10:00.000]  All right.
[10:00.100 --> 10:00.520]  That's Spider-Nut.
[10:00.520 --> 10:02.000]  He's a tough guy to kill.
[10:02.500 --> 10:03.960]  Oh my god.
[10:07.420 --> 10:09.180]  Why was Eric just standing still?
[10:10.340 --> 10:10.960]  I don't know.
[10:11.220 --> 10:11.340]  Why?
[10:11.420 --> 10:12.360]  Not the Mad Hatter.
[10:13.920 --> 10:15.120]  That was a fury kill.
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.000]  I think I had just spawned.
[10:17.960 --> 10:19.240]  Wow, shout out to Spider-Nut.
[10:19.360 --> 10:20.360]  Way to go, Spider-Nut.
[10:20.960 --> 10:22.100]  Congratulations, Spider-Nut.
[10:22.140 --> 10:23.360]  You're a worthy adversary.
[10:23.720 --> 10:24.420]  Yeah, real champ.
[10:24.420 --> 10:27.160]  So that was just like the team deathmatch game mode, I'm guessing?
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.280]  Yeah, it was just tedium.
[10:29.900 --> 10:30.620]  Level 2.
[10:31.200 --> 10:32.220]  I'm still level 7.
[10:32.340 --> 10:33.280]  I'm still level 1.
[10:33.540 --> 10:34.340]  You're level 7?
[10:34.480 --> 10:36.060]  Your KD should have been way better than that.
[10:37.320 --> 10:38.800]  You're playing a video game with me?
[10:39.160 --> 10:39.840]  No, it shouldn't.
[10:40.120 --> 10:40.800]  What was the score?
[10:40.900 --> 10:41.540]  How do I see the score?
[10:42.460 --> 10:43.540]  Uh, hit right trigger for AR.
[10:43.540 --> 10:44.840]  Loadout's available at level 4.
[10:46.300 --> 10:46.660]  Scoreboard...
[10:47.160 --> 10:48.160]  Gavin, you had...
[10:49.840 --> 10:52.140]  7 kills and a .54 KD.
[10:52.320 --> 10:53.720]  I had 11 kills, .55.
[10:54.440 --> 10:57.560]  Johnny Caviar had 16 kills and a 1-0 ratio.
[10:57.660 --> 10:58.440]  You can stop right there.
[10:58.440 --> 10:59.360]  Oh, wow.
[10:59.520 --> 11:00.980]  Alright, I'm gonna try and get double digits then.
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.240]  The score should just be like on the screen.
[11:04.820 --> 11:07.100]  I don't know why I have to press nine buttons to get to it.
[11:07.880 --> 11:08.440]  What do you mean?
[11:08.520 --> 11:10.620]  Let's lodge a formal complaint.
[11:11.060 --> 11:13.380]  Did you want to do one more, Gavin, before we switch over to...
[11:13.380 --> 11:13.980]  Seems like you do.
[11:15.160 --> 11:17.100]  Uh, I would, but what does everyone else do?
[11:17.560 --> 11:18.180]  Let's do it.
[11:18.520 --> 11:18.980]  We should.
[11:20.320 --> 11:22.140]  They're so fast, it doesn't matter.
[11:22.340 --> 11:22.760]  There's no...
[11:23.540 --> 11:24.800]  There's nothing to this.
[11:25.100 --> 11:25.680]  This is so...
[11:26.280 --> 11:30.780]  I don't think I've played a Call of Duty online game really since like 2009.
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.900]  And it is more ephemeral now than it was then.
[11:36.080 --> 11:36.620]  And that's...
[11:36.620 --> 11:37.880]  Man, that's like really saying something.
[11:38.500 --> 11:38.760]  Like...
[11:38.760 --> 11:42.340]  Eric, did you ever get Mile High Club Achievement in Cod 4?
[11:42.500 --> 11:46.000]  Was that the one where you had to go through the, uh, the plane?
[11:46.600 --> 11:46.780]  Yeah.
[11:47.100 --> 11:48.520]  No, I never did it.
[11:49.160 --> 11:50.440]  Maybe, maybe now's the time.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.680]  Maybe now that you're approaching 40.
[11:53.060 --> 11:54.500]  Yeah, no, I don't think so.
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.260]  I don't think I can.
[11:55.260 --> 11:59.840]  I don't think my Twitch reflexes work that way.
[11:59.980 --> 12:01.540]  Do you think you could get it again, Gav?
[12:01.980 --> 12:04.040]  Uh, I bet if you gave me two hours I could do it.
[12:04.080 --> 12:04.800]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[12:04.980 --> 12:05.980]  Oh, it sucked so much.
[12:05.980 --> 12:06.900]  Oh no, the door!
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.180]  The door got me!
[12:08.640 --> 12:09.540]  That's a lot of grenades.
[12:09.720 --> 12:10.560]  Did you die from the door?
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.220]  I did, my feet got stuck in it.
[12:13.940 --> 12:14.440]  Oh, Gavin!
[12:15.800 --> 12:16.760]  Oh my god.
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.780]  We got blown up.
[12:18.620 --> 12:19.720]  We were sat on each other.
[12:20.000 --> 12:20.160]  Yeah.
[12:20.240 --> 12:20.580]  Double kill!
[12:24.020 --> 12:25.660]  Oh, that was almost really cool.
[12:25.940 --> 12:27.920]  I think this is one of those billion dollar plates.
[12:30.020 --> 12:32.100]  In my mind, every plate is a billion dollar plate.
[12:33.820 --> 12:35.380]  Oh, that explodes on impact.
[12:35.480 --> 12:36.000]  That's good to know.
[12:36.260 --> 12:36.880]  Guys, I got two.
[12:37.300 --> 12:38.420]  I prefer bouncy grenades.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.640]  I gotta do more diving, I think.
[12:41.760 --> 12:42.200]  I gotta do more.
[12:42.580 --> 12:44.920]  This game is all about, like, if you're not diving, you're done.
[12:45.380 --> 12:45.580]  Shit.
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.520]  If you're not diving, you're dying.
[12:46.520 --> 12:47.520]  If you're not diving, you're dying.
[12:48.820 --> 12:50.340]  Hey, Nick, we're still here.
[12:50.340 --> 12:50.980]  Hell yeah.
[12:52.520 --> 12:52.920]  Dive!
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.040]  I dove in all of them!
[12:59.100 --> 13:00.280]  I ended up in the middle of all the grenades.
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.700]  Fucking suicide, man.
[13:01.740 --> 13:02.240]  Drop a grenade.
[13:04.540 --> 13:07.000]  Maybe I should just walk around with a claymore on my chest.
[13:07.280 --> 13:07.640]  Oh, shit.
[13:12.650 --> 13:13.930]  Oh, I got eliminations now.
[13:14.190 --> 13:14.730]  That's cool.
[13:16.210 --> 13:17.210]  Hasn't every killed an elimination?
[13:17.950 --> 13:19.370]  I was dead when I got the pop-up.
[13:19.370 --> 13:19.870]  He's got you there.
[13:20.270 --> 13:20.490]  Oh.
[13:21.710 --> 13:22.710]  He's got you there.
[13:23.850 --> 13:24.490]  I like this level.
[13:24.830 --> 13:25.750]  It's really small.
[13:26.190 --> 13:27.230]  Yeah, this one's fun.
[13:27.470 --> 13:27.730]  Tight.
[13:29.010 --> 13:30.170]  Ooh, three kills in a row.
[13:34.430 --> 13:38.690]  My biggest issue with these games is that I instinctively reload after every kill.
[13:38.730 --> 13:40.210]  Yeah, I do the same thing.
[13:41.370 --> 13:43.610]  I gotta let my clip be half full.
[13:43.690 --> 13:44.350]  Yeah, you have to.
[13:44.890 --> 13:46.310]  Are you a clip half full or empty guy?
[13:47.470 --> 13:48.510]  I'm a clip half full.
[13:48.510 --> 13:50.790]  If anything, it's always empty in my mind.
[13:51.530 --> 13:53.290]  If anything, it's a magazine dog clip.
[13:53.810 --> 13:54.310]  Thank you.
[13:56.570 --> 13:57.030]  Got him.
[13:57.090 --> 13:57.470]  Fuck him up.
[13:57.630 --> 13:57.990]  Can you still make those?
[14:01.630 --> 14:01.950]  Blowed.
[14:02.470 --> 14:03.790]  Oh, I thought I was gonna get a double.
[14:04.070 --> 14:04.430]  Damn it.
[14:05.270 --> 14:05.970]  That guy did.
[14:08.010 --> 14:08.490]  Oh, shit.
[14:08.530 --> 14:08.750]  Oh, shit.
[14:08.810 --> 14:09.030]  Oh, shit.
[14:09.210 --> 14:09.450]  Drupal.
[14:11.890 --> 14:12.610]  Billion dollar plane.
[14:14.450 --> 14:15.090]  Save the plane.
[14:15.190 --> 14:15.590]  Save the plane.
[14:15.910 --> 14:16.370]  Billion dollar plane.
[14:18.510 --> 14:20.050]  I like this map.
[14:20.190 --> 14:21.810]  I like this map so much more.
[14:21.870 --> 14:22.250]  It's crazy.
[14:23.050 --> 14:24.570]  We've turned Eric into a fan.
[14:24.730 --> 14:25.450]  Now we can play more.
[14:25.570 --> 14:27.810]  This feels like a totally different game.
[14:28.370 --> 14:29.170]  Holy shit.
[14:29.990 --> 14:31.810]  Well, it's because you've got one round in your belt too.
[14:31.830 --> 14:32.310]  Yeah, that's true.
[14:32.650 --> 14:33.350]  We were getting the feel of it.
[14:33.370 --> 14:33.850]  Where's he going?
[14:33.950 --> 14:35.090]  Oh, he's looping around the other way.
[14:35.830 --> 14:38.150]  I'm sporting in into the middle of the fight.
[14:38.310 --> 14:38.910]  It's crazy.
[14:39.090 --> 14:42.570]  Spent the first half of the other game not even seeing any enemies.
[14:44.370 --> 14:45.230]  All right, we get ping.
[14:45.410 --> 14:45.750]  Oh, shit.
[14:45.970 --> 14:46.030]  Oh!
[14:46.030 --> 14:47.310]  Kills under your belt.
[14:47.490 --> 14:48.710]  Now, suddenly, it's...
[14:48.710 --> 14:49.570]  Oh, hell yeah, Geoff.
[14:49.970 --> 14:50.810]  Hell yeah, Geoff.
[14:50.990 --> 14:51.590]  Billion dollar plane.
[14:52.870 --> 14:53.770]  The door is opened.
[14:55.370 --> 14:57.210]  I think if something costs a thousand million dollars...
[14:57.210 --> 14:59.010]  I'm going to open this fucking door back up.
[14:59.510 --> 14:59.550]  A thousand...
[14:59.550 --> 15:00.310]  Door's back open.
[15:01.630 --> 15:01.750]  Oh.
[15:03.450 --> 15:04.610]  Oh, that was a mistake.
[15:04.790 --> 15:05.970]  Do not try to use the pistol.
[15:06.750 --> 15:07.210]  Just reload.
[15:07.230 --> 15:07.550]  Oh, yeah?
[15:09.530 --> 15:09.930]  Just...
[15:11.010 --> 15:12.070]  God damn it!
[15:12.190 --> 15:12.990]  Oh, a melee kill.
[15:13.070 --> 15:13.490]  That's rare.
[15:15.190 --> 15:16.250]  Yeah, we're in this.
[15:16.410 --> 15:16.950]  52-54.
[15:16.970 --> 15:19.590]  How come my dog doesn't come check on me when I scream like that?
[15:19.670 --> 15:21.150]  She can be worried about me right now.
[15:23.430 --> 15:25.010]  What if there's a real problem?
[15:25.330 --> 15:25.730]  It's true.
[15:27.870 --> 15:29.230]  Why don't you check on him when he's barking?
[15:29.630 --> 15:30.870]  Ted Bundy 2 over there.
[15:30.950 --> 15:31.790]  I do every time.
[15:31.790 --> 15:31.850]  Oh, okay.
[15:31.870 --> 15:32.490]  Don't just shut up.
[15:33.410 --> 15:34.350]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[15:34.870 --> 15:35.910]  Oh, that's not you shooting me.
[15:36.170 --> 15:36.530]  Nope.
[15:38.870 --> 15:39.750]  Yeah, we can win this.
[15:40.050 --> 15:42.150]  Oh, the grenades don't kill them instantly.
[15:42.410 --> 15:42.590]  What?
[15:42.590 --> 15:44.930]  Spring mine kill.
[15:45.070 --> 15:47.010]  That's fucking embarrassing for you, you loser.
[15:47.010 --> 15:47.310]  Is that your loadout?
[15:48.290 --> 15:52.070]  Yeah, I unlocked it at like level five or something.
[15:52.710 --> 15:53.670]  Oh, an impact grenade.
[15:53.890 --> 15:54.130]  Eat shit.
[15:58.670 --> 15:59.910]  Oh my God.
[16:00.730 --> 16:01.370]  They got a sniper.
[16:02.290 --> 16:02.630]  Do they?
[16:02.750 --> 16:05.390]  Fun fact, impact grenades are chocked full of shit.
[16:07.210 --> 16:08.610]  Now part of this balanced breakfast.
[16:10.710 --> 16:12.330]  I spawned and that guy was right there.
[16:12.590 --> 16:12.970]  Yeah.
[16:14.310 --> 16:14.990]  Oh, fuck.
[16:15.910 --> 16:17.390]  I just lit you up, Nick.
[16:17.550 --> 16:18.150]  You sure did, dude.
[16:19.750 --> 16:21.070]  I was chasing a dude.
[16:21.130 --> 16:21.790]  You must have killed him.
[16:22.790 --> 16:25.330]  Dude, wallbanging is pretty prevalent.
[16:26.230 --> 16:26.990]  Oh, God damn it.
[16:26.990 --> 16:27.530]  I should have thrown a grenade.
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.320]  Man, it's the first time I haven't seen someone in like ten seconds.
[16:34.320 --> 16:34.960]  Fucking die.
[16:35.360 --> 16:35.880]  All right, thank you.
[16:38.020 --> 16:39.000]  Oh, there's Geoff.
[16:40.180 --> 16:40.840]  Oh, the other one.
[16:41.000 --> 16:41.720]  Yep, yep, yep.
[16:41.860 --> 16:42.580]  Oh, they're the other way.
[16:42.880 --> 16:44.380]  He walked right through us.
[16:44.500 --> 16:45.240]  Oh my God.
[16:46.280 --> 16:48.320]  Yeah, we got mowed down.
[16:48.540 --> 16:50.220]  Sometimes the good ones will do that.
[16:50.220 --> 16:51.900]  Oh, bees on the billionaire plane.
[16:53.620 --> 16:53.900]  Bees?
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.080]  Bees, bees.
[16:58.000 --> 16:58.920]  Not the bees.
[17:01.020 --> 17:01.980]  All right.
[17:02.180 --> 17:03.700]  God damn, too many of them.
[17:04.800 --> 17:06.900]  That would be an awesome kill streak, bees.
[17:07.180 --> 17:08.120]  Oh, dude.
[17:09.340 --> 17:10.160]  Oh, fuck.
[17:10.280 --> 17:11.340]  What bad time to reload.
[17:11.500 --> 17:12.120]  I just got to get two dudes.
[17:13.800 --> 17:15.020]  That may even play the game.
[17:16.460 --> 17:17.560]  Woo hoo hoo.
[17:18.080 --> 17:18.820]  Third kill.
[17:19.700 --> 17:20.360]  On a tear, boys.
[17:20.380 --> 17:23.040]  Listen to everybody in round two.
[17:23.340 --> 17:25.180]  Suddenly we're having a good time.
[17:25.480 --> 17:26.720]  Fucking thank God.
[17:27.060 --> 17:27.500]  We're going to win.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.340]  Nobody die.
[17:28.600 --> 17:29.260]  I did it.
[17:33.180 --> 17:33.620]  Dude.
[17:35.440 --> 17:37.020]  I think I got to play the game.
[17:37.140 --> 17:37.480]  Let's see.
[17:37.560 --> 17:38.180]  Let's see if it's Andrew.
[17:38.440 --> 17:39.240]  Give it to me.
[17:42.040 --> 17:43.760]  Just crouched in the corner.
[17:44.360 --> 17:45.420]  I was like, oh, there's a guy.
[17:45.780 --> 17:46.280]  Kill you.
[17:46.640 --> 17:47.920]  Oh, there's another guy.
[17:48.140 --> 17:49.740]  Oh, somebody just spawned in.
[17:49.920 --> 17:50.120]  Wow.
[17:52.200 --> 17:52.980]  Smoked him.
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.280]  Kingslayer.
[17:56.780 --> 17:57.500]  Hell yeah.
[17:57.800 --> 17:58.320]  Look at that.
[17:58.560 --> 17:59.460]  Hey, third place.
[17:59.640 --> 17:59.880]  In the middle.
[18:00.940 --> 18:01.460]  Hell yeah.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.080]  Oh, I can pose.
[18:04.080 --> 18:04.600]  That's right, baby.
[18:04.880 --> 18:05.860]  My bee boy stance.
[18:06.320 --> 18:06.640]  Hell yeah.
[18:07.200 --> 18:07.640]  Hey, guys.
[18:07.720 --> 18:09.160]  With me and Eric, it's feast or famine.
[18:11.460 --> 18:12.080]  Let's see.
[18:12.180 --> 18:13.680]  Level two.
[18:15.920 --> 18:16.640]  Level three.
[18:18.740 --> 18:21.240]  Oh, I got a loadout.
[18:21.540 --> 18:22.820]  That was a fun map.
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.080]  Yeah, it was very fun.
[18:24.240 --> 18:25.680]  Nick, you had 28 kills that round.
[18:25.700 --> 18:26.260]  Hot damn.
[18:26.500 --> 18:26.900]  You did great.
[18:27.040 --> 18:27.960]  Can we do zombies or whatever?
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.520]  I already shot.
[18:32.340 --> 18:32.580]  What?
[18:34.780 --> 18:35.300]  What's happening?
[18:35.380 --> 18:39.520]  I mean, so, Eric, the first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to want to make
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.460]  enough money to buy a decent gun.
[18:41.900 --> 18:42.120]  Okay.
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.280]  The way, the only way to do that is to go kill these zombies.
[18:46.780 --> 18:50.340]  And then also the route, like where they're coming through the wall,
[18:50.660 --> 18:54.160]  you can repair those walls if you run up to them and hold an X on them, probably.
[18:54.980 --> 18:55.440]  Or whatever.
[18:56.140 --> 18:56.920]  Not all of them.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.040]  Some of them you might not be able to.
[18:58.920 --> 19:00.280]  And then that's another way to make money.
[19:00.340 --> 19:01.480]  You get like 20 bucks a time.
[19:01.840 --> 19:03.920]  Is the money you shared or for us individually?
[19:04.240 --> 19:04.420]  Individually.
[19:04.860 --> 19:05.440]  I think it's individual.
[19:05.460 --> 19:07.000]  You can see in the bottom left the money.
[19:08.580 --> 19:11.180]  You might not be able to for some reason, Eric,
[19:11.180 --> 19:14.340]  but it's been the case for every single zombie I've ever made that you can.
[19:15.380 --> 19:17.180]  Round accelerant increased difficulty.
[19:17.460 --> 19:18.960]  No, no, no, no, no.
[19:18.960 --> 19:19.480]  You don't want zombies.
[19:20.560 --> 19:21.000]  Oh, God.
[19:21.060 --> 19:23.240]  That's what people are trying to beat the Easter egg.
[19:23.780 --> 19:25.620]  These Easter eggs are like the most.
[19:26.220 --> 19:29.260]  Every Call of Duty zombies map has an Easter egg in it.
[19:29.300 --> 19:30.140]  That's multi parts.
[19:30.140 --> 19:35.100]  That takes four to 12 hours of gameplay in a row or something.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.300]  And they're insanely complicated.
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.660]  I'm trying to melee these guys,
[19:40.660 --> 19:41.760]  but I don't know if that was the best.
[19:43.580 --> 19:45.480]  They're a little rough sometimes here.
[19:45.900 --> 19:47.920]  You don't want to melee anybody when you're in a group of them.
[19:48.020 --> 19:52.820]  But if they're one hit, mostly.
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.200]  The guns that you can buy are on the walls.
[19:58.460 --> 20:02.920]  Eric, you're going to want to look for some sort of assault rifle.
[20:03.240 --> 20:03.380]  Okay.
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.940]  Is salvage money?
[20:07.000 --> 20:08.100]  I don't know what salvage is.
[20:08.180 --> 20:09.060]  I've never seen that before.
[20:09.240 --> 20:09.440]  Okay.
[20:12.320 --> 20:13.120]  Ooh, salvage.
[20:13.980 --> 20:15.020]  Salvage appears to be different.
[20:17.740 --> 20:19.380]  That increases the difficulty, Gavin.
[20:19.980 --> 20:21.600]  Yeah, I already hit that like six or seven times.
[20:21.940 --> 20:22.280]  Oh, no!
[20:22.840 --> 20:23.240]  No, I didn't really.
[20:23.580 --> 20:23.900]  Okay.
[20:24.620 --> 20:25.560]  What is this?
[20:25.960 --> 20:26.640]  All the elevator.
[20:26.840 --> 20:27.760]  It's a gumball machine, probably.
[20:29.680 --> 20:30.620]  I did the gumball machine.
[20:31.460 --> 20:32.380]  Oh, I didn't turn on.
[20:34.400 --> 20:35.580]  Arsenal accelerator, sure.
[20:36.340 --> 20:39.340]  I'm not sure what you get, how it works in this one.
[20:39.420 --> 20:39.700]  Oh, shit.
[20:39.700 --> 20:45.060]  In every other zombies game, gumballs are perks you get.
[20:45.340 --> 20:46.000]  Oh, my good god.
[20:46.400 --> 20:48.840]  Like, that you can apply to your character.
[20:49.080 --> 20:52.940]  Like, if you fall down, you get up fast or you reload quicker or whatever.
[20:53.820 --> 20:55.780]  There you go. That's the gun you want when you can afford it.
[20:55.940 --> 20:56.280]  I got it.
[20:57.360 --> 20:58.120]  Who shot me?
[20:58.920 --> 21:00.180]  What? Was that a security guard?
[21:01.040 --> 21:01.920]  Oh, he was.
[21:02.200 --> 21:03.420]  There's like a guy with a gun down here.
[21:04.600 --> 21:05.100]  Climb us.
[21:05.700 --> 21:06.600]  Oh, shit, they hopped.
[21:07.240 --> 21:08.660]  Oh, I didn't know we were all hanging.
[21:08.660 --> 21:10.720]  I didn't know that the goal was to be together.
[21:11.100 --> 21:12.760]  You guys are going to have to stay together.
[21:14.040 --> 21:19.720]  The only way that I've ever seen this game is my roommate playing it very, very high,
[21:19.800 --> 21:20.720]  like by himself.
[21:21.620 --> 21:23.100]  Yeah, it's something you do on your own.
[21:23.200 --> 21:26.540]  The only way I've ever seen this.
[21:27.340 --> 21:30.780]  This is the ultimate teamwork game.
[21:31.180 --> 21:33.900]  Should we be shielding up or no?
[21:35.200 --> 21:37.220]  We have armor like in Warzone.
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.960]  I'm not sure.
[21:39.060 --> 21:39.740]  I don't know.
[21:39.800 --> 21:40.380]  Oh, hell yeah.
[21:40.520 --> 21:40.880]  Yeah, probably.
[21:41.140 --> 21:41.900]  We got max armor.
[21:42.240 --> 21:43.340]  Yeah, I just picked up a thing.
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.300]  There was a guy in here with a gun.
[21:46.240 --> 21:49.600]  Sometimes when you kill a zombie, it'll drop a green power up if you hit it.
[21:49.900 --> 21:54.120]  It'll be like max ammo, automatic, all zombies die.
[21:55.580 --> 21:56.040]  What's this?
[21:56.200 --> 21:56.540]  Locked door.
[21:56.700 --> 21:57.400]  So I'm gonna...
[21:57.400 --> 21:57.720]  Oh, you're...
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.780]  Should we buy the door open?
[21:59.200 --> 22:00.120]  We can buy it open.
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.320]  Yeah, let's do it.
[22:02.540 --> 22:02.940]  I'm on my way.
[22:03.340 --> 22:04.300]  Buy, pay half.
[22:04.980 --> 22:05.420]  I'll pay half.
[22:05.640 --> 22:06.500]  You guys want to split the bill?
[22:06.500 --> 22:07.560]  Yeah, I'll split it.
[22:07.780 --> 22:08.660]  Cool, you can do that, man.
[22:08.720 --> 22:08.940]  Nice.
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.140]  Andrew, they're right behind you.
[22:11.280 --> 22:12.460]  Yeah, I'm running past.
[22:13.640 --> 22:15.240]  I'm headed to the star.
[22:16.380 --> 22:16.640]  Okay.
[22:18.600 --> 22:19.000]  Oh.
[22:20.640 --> 22:22.080]  You think you'll get Luigi this time?
[22:24.180 --> 22:26.720]  Oh man, I was gonna cut a social video from that.
[22:27.400 --> 22:27.800]  I...
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.780]  Okay, I'm activating a thing.
[22:32.900 --> 22:32.960]  What?
[22:33.740 --> 22:34.520]  Die, you bitch.
[22:35.440 --> 22:36.140]  Die, bitch ass.
[22:36.500 --> 22:36.680]  Yeah.
[22:38.100 --> 22:39.700]  Oh, refill weapon ammo.
[22:39.900 --> 22:40.300]  Oh, are you...
[22:40.300 --> 22:40.720]  Cost money.
[22:40.840 --> 22:41.480]  Fuck, I didn't read it.
[22:41.600 --> 22:41.720]  Shit.
[22:42.380 --> 22:44.060]  Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
[22:44.340 --> 22:44.540]  Oh boy.
[22:44.540 --> 22:46.200]  And you already paid for one of these two doors.
[22:48.380 --> 22:52.240]  Also, I might as well tell you guys, or I guess Eric, because you guys probably know,
[22:52.300 --> 22:55.880]  there's a thing called a mystery box that's somewhere on the map at all times.
[22:56.240 --> 22:58.660]  You can buy into it for like two grand,
[22:58.860 --> 23:01.540]  and it will give you a random weapon that might be amazing.
[23:01.960 --> 23:02.340]  Oh, really?
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.460]  Can you guys group up on me and help cover this thing in a minute?
[23:05.600 --> 23:05.940]  Sure.
[23:05.940 --> 23:12.400]  Then, also, all of the weapons on the game that you have can be thrown into a machine
[23:12.400 --> 23:14.080]  that increase them, their abilities.
[23:14.540 --> 23:16.320]  You can do it to each gun like three times.
[23:16.460 --> 23:17.700]  You'll have to at some point.
[23:17.880 --> 23:19.900]  The guns, the base guns won't be powerful enough.
[23:21.660 --> 23:22.940]  Can I get a better gun?
[23:23.340 --> 23:23.540]  Oh, okay.
[23:23.680 --> 23:24.900]  Yeah, just buy one off the wall or whatever.
[23:25.700 --> 23:26.680]  You guys are level five.
[23:26.840 --> 23:28.040]  There were a bunch on the ground earlier.
[23:28.800 --> 23:29.460]  Yeah, I picked one up.
[23:29.520 --> 23:31.300]  I just thought it ran out, but I got ammo somehow.
[23:31.700 --> 23:33.920]  Gavin, could you throw 500 bucks into this?
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.340]  Yeah, I mean, I bought that door, but...
[23:36.340 --> 23:37.280]  I mean, I just bought it.
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.360]  I can.
[23:38.420 --> 23:39.000]  Where is it?
[23:39.060 --> 23:39.220]  This?
[23:39.420 --> 23:40.500]  I helped buy the door.
[23:41.100 --> 23:41.900]  I helped buy the door.
[23:42.180 --> 23:43.600]  What do I buy into?
[23:43.720 --> 23:45.220]  Okay, now we got to protect the amp thing.
[23:45.720 --> 23:45.900]  Okay.
[23:46.720 --> 23:47.980]  Wow, this pistol's so easy.
[23:48.180 --> 23:48.320]  Hey, Nick.
[23:48.500 --> 23:49.700]  Nick, they're coming right behind you.
[23:50.020 --> 23:50.420]  Oh, cool.
[23:53.400 --> 23:54.120]  Oh, it's on it.
[23:54.220 --> 23:54.760]  They're on it.
[23:56.320 --> 23:56.960]  Oh, God.
[23:58.500 --> 24:00.120]  He's got to hold for seven more seconds.
[24:05.000 --> 24:05.360]  Woo!
[24:06.300 --> 24:06.660]  Fuck.
[24:07.120 --> 24:08.240]  Oh, fuck me.
[24:08.420 --> 24:09.740]  That escalated so bad.
[24:09.760 --> 24:10.220]  There we go.
[24:10.340 --> 24:11.060]  Nice, nice, nice.
[24:11.220 --> 24:11.360]  Okay.
[24:13.360 --> 24:14.840]  We just got to do that one more time.
[24:15.280 --> 24:15.640]  Okay.
[24:15.840 --> 24:17.100]  Really? I was not ready for that.
[24:20.320 --> 24:21.120]  Felt like you got it.
[24:21.200 --> 24:23.280]  Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[24:23.940 --> 24:24.300]  Sorry.
[24:25.140 --> 24:26.880]  So when I say, what?
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.720]  Yeah, I got really excited and I blocked you out.
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.620]  So I said it, and then there was like five seconds of you dying.
[24:32.620 --> 24:36.480]  Not really excited because there were a lot of them around me.
[24:36.560 --> 24:39.500]  The only reason there were five seconds is because it took them that long to get to you.
[24:39.800 --> 24:40.860]  Yes, exactly.
[24:41.100 --> 24:42.280]  Yeah, don't do this, don't do this.
[24:42.640 --> 24:43.300]  You got it, man.
[24:43.340 --> 24:43.880]  I got it.
[24:43.920 --> 24:44.740]  I'm going to do it.
[24:45.100 --> 24:46.600]  Why were we not hitting the noose?
[24:46.880 --> 24:47.540]  So that way...
[24:47.540 --> 24:48.900]  Do you want to wait until there's more enemies on the screen?
[24:48.900 --> 24:49.240]  Yeah, so that way...
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.700]  There were five near you, and now there's 30 around all of us.
[24:54.880 --> 24:56.760]  To be fair, I got all of them outside too.
[24:57.120 --> 24:58.060]  I've killed everything.
[24:58.240 --> 25:00.960]  It's true, but the longer you wait, the more spawns.
[25:00.960 --> 25:01.560]  It clears the hole up.
[25:01.980 --> 25:02.200]  Right.
[25:03.300 --> 25:07.040]  It clears what's on the screen at the moment, but they're continually spawned.
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.020]  Oh, dude, I know about nuke.
[25:10.480 --> 25:12.580]  I know how important nuke is.
[25:13.200 --> 25:13.560]  The town?
[25:16.080 --> 25:16.460]  Woo!
[25:17.140 --> 25:17.700]  They're burning.
[25:18.160 --> 25:19.040]  That is a good map, though.
[25:19.240 --> 25:19.900]  Yeah, it's a great map.
[25:20.700 --> 25:21.420]  Oh, we should play a lot.
[25:21.640 --> 25:22.500]  Is there a new nuke town?
[25:23.240 --> 25:24.160]  I don't know, I can look.
[25:24.280 --> 25:25.800]  Is that the one with like the mannequins or whatever?
[25:26.340 --> 25:27.180]  Yeah, like the old...
[25:27.180 --> 25:27.960]  The old, yeah.
[25:28.500 --> 25:29.520]  The old 60s.
[25:29.740 --> 25:30.180]  I remember that.
[25:30.380 --> 25:31.060]  Double points.
[25:32.060 --> 25:32.500]  Nice.
[25:32.880 --> 25:34.320]  I'm so low on ammo, what happened?
[25:36.100 --> 25:36.620]  You shot it.
[25:36.840 --> 25:37.040]  Shopping.
[25:38.000 --> 25:38.860]  Run, Gavin!
[25:40.420 --> 25:42.040]  Oh, I also need ammo, damn.
[25:42.320 --> 25:43.080]  Oh, shit!
[25:43.380 --> 25:44.600]  Didn't realize this got so low.
[25:48.380 --> 25:49.040]  I'm surrounded.
[25:49.320 --> 25:49.940]  Up top, I'm getting...
[25:50.760 --> 25:51.180]  I'm down.
[25:54.460 --> 25:57.300]  There are a couple at the top of the stairs as well here.
[25:58.500 --> 26:00.020]  I'm running for ammo and then I'll be back.
[26:01.900 --> 26:02.500]  We tried.
[26:04.940 --> 26:05.240]  Goddamn.
[26:08.600 --> 26:11.080]  Gavin, if you want to hop down and give me a hand, that'd be cool.
[26:11.200 --> 26:12.800]  But also, you're up there with Nick, so it's up to you.
[26:13.280 --> 26:14.020]  I'm jumping down.
[26:14.660 --> 26:14.800]  Okay.
[26:15.360 --> 26:15.780]  Oh, I'm up.
[26:16.900 --> 26:17.500]  Thank you.
[26:18.740 --> 26:20.460]  I'm out of ammo, so I'll let you help.
[26:24.040 --> 26:24.340]  Balls.
[26:25.460 --> 26:28.540]  Man, my biggest issue is just the slow reloading.
[26:28.740 --> 26:29.200]  Holy shit.
[26:29.220 --> 26:30.460]  Oh, yeah, very slow.
[26:31.100 --> 26:33.900]  Oh, do you want to start grouping up near me on the right?
[26:34.180 --> 26:35.080]  You want to come over to here?
[26:37.520 --> 26:38.180]  Where on the right?
[26:38.440 --> 26:38.800]  The right wall.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.340]  Just my name, just see my name.
[26:42.360 --> 26:45.360]  I'm not gonna lie to you, there's a lot of zombie between you and them.
[26:45.740 --> 26:46.620]  Yep, sure is.
[26:46.700 --> 26:47.600]  Or between you, yeah.
[26:48.540 --> 26:49.000]  Between us.
[26:49.040 --> 26:49.440]  Okay, covering.
[26:51.240 --> 26:51.780]  Grenade out.
[26:53.460 --> 26:54.200]  Oh, who's down?
[26:54.720 --> 26:55.580]  Me, still.
[27:00.040 --> 27:00.720]  I'm gonna get you.
[27:01.240 --> 27:02.020]  I'm coming to Andrew.
[27:02.460 --> 27:03.340]  Yep, gotcha.
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.240]  Thank you.
[27:04.280 --> 27:04.700]  I'll cover you.
[27:04.980 --> 27:05.260]  Welcome.
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.240]  I'm gonna open this.
[27:11.500 --> 27:13.860]  Yeah, yeah, that was a bad situation right now.
[27:14.000 --> 27:14.560]  You got ammo anywhere?
[27:16.840 --> 27:17.830]  We can, uh...
[27:18.720 --> 27:19.420]  Oh, body armor.
[27:20.260 --> 27:22.540]  I think you can buy ammo for 500 bucks.
[27:22.580 --> 27:23.560]  Oh, Gavin, are you down?
[27:23.780 --> 27:25.200]  I'm looking for it.
[27:25.660 --> 27:26.660]  It'd be on the wall somewhere.
[27:26.960 --> 27:29.140]  We can, uh, we can probably play Nuketown, Gav,
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.260]  but we'll have to load an older Call of Duty game to do it.
[27:32.260 --> 27:33.980]  Maybe we'll plan to do that down the road,
[27:34.400 --> 27:35.760]  and make sure everybody has it installed.
[27:36.060 --> 27:37.680]  Because it might be, I'm not sure which version it is,
[27:37.740 --> 27:38.760]  so I'll have to poke around.
[27:39.100 --> 27:41.140]  I was just wondering if they had, like, a remake.
[27:41.920 --> 27:45.300]  I mean, they've remade it a hundred times, but not in this one.
[27:51.080 --> 27:52.760]  Still out of ammo.
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.520]  There should be an ammo box somewhere else.
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.580]  The move typically is to leave one zombie that doesn't have legs.
[28:00.920 --> 28:01.940]  Oh, like a shopping zombie?
[28:02.360 --> 28:02.680]  Yeah.
[28:03.720 --> 28:06.080]  So maybe that one that's crawling, let's keep him alive.
[28:06.160 --> 28:06.760]  Yeah, keep it alive.
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.000]  And then somebody just kites him around while everybody else does shit.
[28:12.760 --> 28:13.260]  Is this ammo?
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.860]  So if you guys come to where I'm at, there's an ammo cache here.
[28:17.780 --> 28:18.140]  Awesome.
[28:19.240 --> 28:21.160]  Is there a pack-a-punch machine anywhere?
[28:21.240 --> 28:21.940]  Have you seen one, Andrew?
[28:21.980 --> 28:22.960]  Hey, there's the mystery box.
[28:24.580 --> 28:24.940]  Oh.
[28:25.120 --> 28:26.260]  Mystery box is on Eric, if anybody cares.
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.060]  Yeah, I got it.
[28:27.160 --> 28:27.260]  Oh, shit.
[28:28.120 --> 28:28.740]  And the mystery ammo...
[28:29.380 --> 28:30.840]  Switch your gun, Eric. Switch your gun.
[28:30.900 --> 28:31.740]  Hit Y before you do that.
[28:31.920 --> 28:32.120]  Thank you.
[28:32.140 --> 28:32.440]  There you go.
[28:34.320 --> 28:36.640]  Oh, you have to switch the guns for that, got it.
[28:36.720 --> 28:37.840]  Were we supposed to kill this zombie?
[28:37.920 --> 28:39.020]  Oh, I see. There's another zombie.
[28:39.040 --> 28:39.480]  There's a bunch.
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.200]  Blup, blup, blup, blup, blup, blup.
[28:41.320 --> 28:42.140]  What's it got up?
[28:42.220 --> 28:43.100]  Blup, blup, blup, blup, blup.
[28:44.220 --> 28:44.700]  Ooh, shotgun.
[28:45.100 --> 28:45.280]  Ooh.
[28:46.000 --> 28:47.100]  Where's the mystery thingy?
[28:47.360 --> 28:47.880]  Right here?
[28:48.020 --> 28:48.920]  It's a... thing?
[28:50.000 --> 28:50.120]  Okay.
[28:51.520 --> 28:54.500]  Now, any weapon you guys pull out of there, you should pack-a-punch if you can find it.
[28:55.280 --> 28:56.300]  You got your crawler, watch out.
[28:57.440 --> 28:57.760]  Yep.
[28:58.420 --> 28:58.920]  He's crawling.
[28:59.180 --> 28:59.560]  Here we go.
[28:59.880 --> 29:00.680]  Where's pack-a-punch?
[29:01.960 --> 29:03.480]  Run around. Let's see if we can find it.
[29:03.860 --> 29:04.900]  Wow, a pistol.
[29:05.300 --> 29:08.420]  If you guys leave that dude alive though, you get the map to just explore it.
[29:08.480 --> 29:09.680]  A wondrous pistol.
[29:10.460 --> 29:10.580]  Oops.
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.400]  How do I zoom on this map?
[29:12.500 --> 29:14.400]  You could, you could open the map and see where the pack-a-punch is.
[29:14.840 --> 29:14.980]  Oh.
[29:15.580 --> 29:17.680]  Did somebody just kill the zombie that was crawling on the ground?
[29:18.680 --> 29:18.880]  Yeah.
[29:19.560 --> 29:19.740]  Who?
[29:20.220 --> 29:21.340]  Yeah, who killed him?
[29:21.440 --> 29:22.140]  Because it wasn't me.
[29:22.300 --> 29:24.260]  And I was watching Andrew, so it wasn't Andrew.
[29:24.480 --> 29:25.620]  And then Gavin said...
[29:25.620 --> 29:26.200]  He...
[29:26.200 --> 29:26.580]  Somebody did it.
[29:26.580 --> 29:28.340]  He might have just died.
[29:28.540 --> 29:28.780]  Uh-huh.
[29:29.520 --> 29:31.640]  Oh, I fired my gun while I was in the map by accident.
[29:31.820 --> 29:32.880]  I don't think I was aimed at him.
[29:32.880 --> 29:33.620]  Yeah, so was you.
[29:33.880 --> 29:34.840]  Okay, cool.
[29:34.860 --> 29:37.160]  That would have been amazing if I accidentally killed it.
[29:38.240 --> 29:38.560]  Uh...
[29:38.560 --> 29:39.180]  Surely not.
[29:39.300 --> 29:39.760]  There's one here.
[29:39.980 --> 29:40.600]  Oh, behind you.
[29:41.660 --> 29:42.500]  Oh, it's just news, obviously.
[29:42.860 --> 29:43.960]  Right, we ended the round.
[29:45.780 --> 29:46.460]  Oh, you know what?
[29:46.500 --> 29:47.120]  Maybe he didn't.
[29:47.800 --> 29:48.300]  What do you mean?
[29:49.960 --> 29:51.280]  Oh, I think he did.
[29:51.820 --> 29:52.320]  Did what?
[29:53.300 --> 29:53.900]  End the round.
[29:54.000 --> 29:54.500]  I guess he did.
[29:54.620 --> 29:56.220]  Yeah, no, it said that we were going into a new round.
[29:56.360 --> 29:56.760]  We went into a second.
[29:56.760 --> 29:57.560]  Oh, shit!
[29:58.400 --> 29:59.400]  I'm down on the bridge.
[30:00.400 --> 30:00.740]  Uh-oh.
[30:01.080 --> 30:01.400]  Fuck.
[30:02.040 --> 30:03.620]  I'll crawl to you, luckily.
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.680]  What the fuck is that?
[30:05.200 --> 30:05.660]  Shit, shit, shit.
[30:05.660 --> 30:06.740]  If Nick...
[30:06.740 --> 30:08.100]  They got stuff from the thing over here?
[30:08.180 --> 30:09.520]  Oh my god, it's a SPID.
[30:12.040 --> 30:12.580]  Oh, yeah, we're...
[30:12.580 --> 30:13.580]  Oh, nice grenade!
[30:13.980 --> 30:14.340]  Nice.
[30:14.700 --> 30:16.940]  You guys gotta get him up.
[30:17.100 --> 30:17.880]  The nuke's a new thing.
[30:18.020 --> 30:18.860]  Don't touch it yet.
[30:19.020 --> 30:19.880]  Yeah, well...
[30:21.120 --> 30:22.220]  Give it time, Andrew, we'll find it.
[30:24.160 --> 30:24.880]  I'm on my way!
[30:24.980 --> 30:25.320]  I'm gonna ping it.
[30:26.600 --> 30:27.140]  Right here.
[30:27.660 --> 30:28.620]  It doesn't time out, does it?
[30:29.400 --> 30:30.440]  Uh, yes, I think it will.
[30:30.740 --> 30:31.380]  It's about to.
[30:31.380 --> 30:31.900]  It's about to.
[30:32.660 --> 30:32.880]  No!
[30:34.040 --> 30:34.980]  Don't let it time out.
[30:36.460 --> 30:37.780]  Okay, so do you guys see over here?
[30:37.900 --> 30:39.740]  There's health you can buy and an additional armor thing?
[30:40.480 --> 30:40.620]  Yeah.
[30:40.860 --> 30:41.980]  Oh, that was five grand?
[30:42.040 --> 30:42.560]  What a rip.
[30:44.080 --> 30:44.900]  That's very expensive.
[30:45.760 --> 30:46.540]  Gotta turn on the power.
[30:51.330 --> 30:52.050]  Are we...
[30:52.050 --> 30:53.610]  You must turn on the power first.
[30:53.970 --> 30:55.610]  Yeah, so that orange marker?
[30:56.070 --> 30:56.250]  Yeah.
[30:56.370 --> 30:57.230]  We have two of three of those.
[30:57.370 --> 30:58.390]  We almost have power back.
[30:58.730 --> 30:59.270]  Oh, okay, cool.
[30:59.610 --> 31:01.310]  Do we need to, like, jump to it or what?
[31:02.910 --> 31:03.390]  Uh...
[31:03.390 --> 31:04.430]  Do we go down?
[31:04.950 --> 31:05.910]  What the fuck?
[31:06.550 --> 31:08.330]  Oh, there's a down over here.
[31:08.450 --> 31:09.170]  What are these?
[31:09.550 --> 31:10.670]  Oh, there's a, yeah, elevator.
[31:11.670 --> 31:13.730]  Oh, shit, we got, like, fucking bugs!
[31:13.810 --> 31:14.930]  Ah, bugs!
[31:15.310 --> 31:15.690]  Creatures!
[31:17.890 --> 31:18.770]  There's an elevator?
[31:18.890 --> 31:19.370]  Oh, I see.
[31:20.330 --> 31:22.070]  Do you want to group up on the...
[31:22.070 --> 31:22.430]  Okay.
[31:22.830 --> 31:23.450]  I've already descended.
[31:24.510 --> 31:27.090]  There's also a ramp that circles them.
[31:29.370 --> 31:30.210]  I mean, we...
[31:30.210 --> 31:31.550]  I don't like these bugs!
[31:31.790 --> 31:33.630]  We keep standing around, I just know what the point is.
[31:34.930 --> 31:35.790]  All right, I'm down.
[31:36.870 --> 31:37.470]  Oh, wait.
[31:37.670 --> 31:38.690]  Oh, shit, up there you're down?
[31:39.030 --> 31:39.470]  You're down up?
[31:39.730 --> 31:40.510]  I'm down up, baby.
[31:40.710 --> 31:41.090]  Whoa!
[31:41.490 --> 31:43.510]  Ah, you guys are in a lot of trouble if he's down up.
[31:43.610 --> 31:44.530]  You gotta get up there and get him.
[31:44.610 --> 31:44.950]  I'm mid.
[31:46.390 --> 31:47.790]  Where the fuck is mid?
[31:48.830 --> 31:49.450]  Hang on.
[31:49.770 --> 31:50.370]  Hey, Nick.
[31:50.770 --> 31:50.990]  Yeah?
[31:51.230 --> 31:53.970]  When you say you're down, what does that mean to you?
[31:54.330 --> 31:55.750]  I came down the ramp.
[31:56.030 --> 31:56.950]  Oh my god, Nick.
[31:56.950 --> 31:57.670]  Oh my god.
[31:57.670 --> 31:58.330]  Oh my god.
[31:58.530 --> 32:00.190]  You guys are level seven somehow, by the way.
[32:01.570 --> 32:02.370]  Um, Nick.
[32:02.790 --> 32:03.190]  Yes?
[32:03.430 --> 32:04.630]  That's not what that means.
[32:05.570 --> 32:10.410]  When you say you're down, that means you need to be picked up because you're bleeding out.
[32:11.450 --> 32:11.890]  Yeah, that bit?
[32:13.430 --> 32:15.390]  That's kind of a universal one, Nick.
[32:15.990 --> 32:16.190]  Yeah.
[32:16.410 --> 32:16.810]  Nice.
[32:17.090 --> 32:18.010]  I see what you're saying, yes.
[32:18.150 --> 32:19.110]  I'm down the ramp.
[32:20.710 --> 32:23.110]  Again, with a pause there is still weird.
[32:23.770 --> 32:24.750]  What's a foot flopper?
[32:27.430 --> 32:28.230]  Another door.
[32:28.930 --> 32:32.910]  I feel like this... my guns are so ineffective so soon.
[32:33.010 --> 32:33.410]  Yeah.
[32:33.410 --> 32:34.630]  That's why you guys need to pack a punch.
[32:36.650 --> 32:37.050]  Ow.
[32:37.930 --> 32:38.890]  Oh yeah, let me get out.
[32:39.090 --> 32:42.130]  These level one guns are, uh, by level 10 are useless.
[32:42.470 --> 32:43.630]  Yeah, this is not working for me.
[32:43.630 --> 32:44.450]  You'll kill anybody.
[32:44.570 --> 32:45.590]  The reloads, please.
[32:46.210 --> 32:46.610]  Damn it.
[32:46.790 --> 32:47.910]  What the fuck is this guy?
[32:48.190 --> 32:48.670]  Let me out.
[32:49.130 --> 32:49.830]  Oh god.
[32:49.910 --> 32:50.130]  Let me fucking time out.
[32:50.470 --> 32:51.730]  Oh shit, I'm down.
[32:52.030 --> 32:52.770]  I am actually down.
[32:54.970 --> 32:56.970]  The stairs over by where we need to go.
[32:57.030 --> 32:57.550]  Come on, guys.
[32:58.410 --> 32:59.490]  Reservation wins again.
[33:01.570 --> 33:01.970]  Yes.
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.410]  Come get me.
[33:02.750 --> 33:03.570]  Come get me.
[33:04.850 --> 33:05.990]  Ah, I just went down.
[33:05.990 --> 33:06.630]  Eric's down too.
[33:08.710 --> 33:09.270]  God damn it.
[33:09.970 --> 33:11.670]  I just got too separated from everyone.
[33:11.950 --> 33:15.150]  I was trying to make my way to Nick and it just wasn't happening.
[33:15.530 --> 33:16.690]  You want to hold hands while we die?
[33:17.450 --> 33:18.250]  Certainly not.
[33:18.910 --> 33:19.370]  All right.
[33:20.010 --> 33:20.870]  Oh, I'm gonna shoot myself then.
[33:21.510 --> 33:22.610]  Gavin's, Gavin's down too.
[33:22.870 --> 33:24.090]  Yeah, I got the power back on.
[33:24.790 --> 33:25.210]  Oh, cool.
[33:25.610 --> 33:25.910]  Cool.
[33:26.170 --> 33:26.430]  Cool.
[33:26.850 --> 33:30.230]  I'll get to see one light one last time as the light fades in my brain.
[33:30.230 --> 33:33.270]  Well, yeah, you'll see the light turn on at the end of the tunnel.
[33:33.470 --> 33:34.030]  Yeah, goodbye.
[33:35.550 --> 33:37.070]  Holy fuck, there's a lot of them.
[33:37.470 --> 33:39.990]  Yeah, it would be helpful if you had like three more teammates, huh?
[33:42.870 --> 33:44.110]  Hang on, he's got to think on that one.
[33:47.210 --> 33:55.210]  I think if Andrew can complete, if Andrew and, uh, if Andrew and, well, whoever's left alive.
[33:55.270 --> 33:55.830]  Okay, Andrew.
[33:55.830 --> 33:58.610]  Can complete the level, you guys will all respawn.
[33:58.750 --> 34:02.370]  Well, we, Andrew, Andrew's doing it a number one style, baby.
[34:02.990 --> 34:06.010]  All he has to do is find a nuke.
[34:07.210 --> 34:08.610]  Yeah, so you will.
[34:08.710 --> 34:08.890]  Yep.
[34:09.530 --> 34:14.330]  You will respawn with pistols again and none of your perks, which sucks.
[34:14.630 --> 34:14.850]  Great.
[34:15.310 --> 34:16.610]  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[34:16.630 --> 34:19.470]  It's like a, it really is like a death knell to die.
[34:20.670 --> 34:22.630]  Well, I suppose that makes sense.
[34:24.430 --> 34:29.290]  It's real hard to fight your way back into the game at that point.
[34:33.030 --> 34:34.050]  That was clever.
[34:34.570 --> 34:35.430]  That was very cool.
[34:36.490 --> 34:37.430]  Is this where you're supposed to go?
[34:37.770 --> 34:38.550]  I think so, yeah.
[34:39.210 --> 34:39.530]  Oh, neat.
[34:40.750 --> 34:41.510]  Oh, nice.
[34:41.790 --> 34:42.890]  It did not go further than that.
[34:42.990 --> 34:43.450]  I thought it would.
[34:46.070 --> 34:47.570]  Hey, pack a punched.
[34:47.850 --> 34:48.410]  There you go.
[34:49.050 --> 34:51.250]  Oh, wow, that makes a big difference, huh?
[34:51.870 --> 34:52.510]  That's, uh-huh.
[34:52.530 --> 34:53.210]  That's amazing.
[34:53.310 --> 34:54.030]  Imagine if we all had that.
[34:54.710 --> 34:55.110]  Wow.
[34:56.110 --> 34:59.290]  Is this like a, is this like a limited time boost to your gun?
[34:59.370 --> 35:00.710]  Or is this just like what your gun does now?
[35:00.770 --> 35:01.930]  No, it's your gun is this level now.
[35:02.010 --> 35:02.390]  Oh, wow.
[35:02.810 --> 35:07.130]  And then, so what you end up doing is you can put that your gun, the same gun through,
[35:07.330 --> 35:08.530]  I think, two times?
[35:09.710 --> 35:14.070]  And so what you end up doing is you just hit the, this game just becomes about collecting
[35:14.070 --> 35:19.090]  money to hit the mystery box to get the best gun to then max it out, to then switch out
[35:19.090 --> 35:22.250]  your other gun for the best gun to max it out.
[35:22.390 --> 35:22.630]  Huh.
[35:23.430 --> 35:24.550]  Whoa, Goku showed up.
[35:24.670 --> 35:28.590]  And you really got to, because by like level 40, it's insane.
[35:29.030 --> 35:29.430]  Interesting.
[35:32.870 --> 35:34.270]  Oh, fuck me.
[35:34.710 --> 35:36.430]  Oh, dude, you're, you're, can you hit?
[35:36.650 --> 35:37.370]  I'm dead, I'm dead.
[35:37.610 --> 35:39.790]  Whoa, it just went black, like a horror movie.
[35:40.030 --> 35:40.970]  It's like the Sopranos.
[35:41.510 --> 35:42.830]  It's pretty cool, oh my god.
[35:43.170 --> 35:43.550]  Get away!
[35:44.490 --> 35:45.950]  Oh, why is Jack doing that?
[35:48.210 --> 35:49.870]  Well, I think that was Call of Duty.
[35:51.230 --> 35:54.430]  Having a couple of, uh, why'd the announcer laugh at us?
[35:54.890 --> 35:55.910]  Because he messed up.
[35:56.250 --> 35:56.710]  He's evil.
[35:56.930 --> 35:58.030]  We got the same kills.
[35:58.350 --> 35:59.950]  Oh, that's fun for us.
[36:00.190 --> 36:01.650]  How many doorbys did you have?
[36:03.310 --> 36:04.110]  Uh, half.
[36:07.690 --> 36:13.110]  Uh, I can see how this is like a, like a gameplay loop that you can get like really addicted to.
[36:13.710 --> 36:13.830]  Um.
[36:14.730 --> 36:15.410]  Yeah, I enjoyed that.
[36:15.730 --> 36:16.970]  I leveled up a bunch.
[36:17.050 --> 36:17.870]  I leveled up like two levels.
[36:18.750 --> 36:19.810]  Cool, I'm level four.
[36:19.970 --> 36:20.930]  I don't know what I get.
[36:21.030 --> 36:23.190]  Do I get to do anything with this stuff or it's just like stuff?
[36:23.830 --> 36:24.230]  Loadout.
[36:24.490 --> 36:27.790]  Call of Duty is the ultimate upgrade game.
[36:27.970 --> 36:30.610]  You now go into your gunsmith and you go nuts.
[36:30.750 --> 36:34.970]  There's one for multiplayer, so you level up your multiplayer and your zombies differently.
[36:35.210 --> 36:40.010]  I think that, I think they're on the same loop now, aren't they?
[36:40.270 --> 36:43.670]  Aren't, isn't the prestige for the online the same for the prestige for the zombies?
[36:44.610 --> 36:46.410]  It might be, but I think you have different loadouts.
[36:46.610 --> 36:47.930]  I think it changed for this, which is crazy.
[36:48.130 --> 36:48.330]  What's up?
[36:48.410 --> 36:49.950]  Who's friends with your mom's flaps?
[36:51.030 --> 36:51.390]  Nobody.
[36:52.110 --> 36:52.310]  Oh.
[36:53.190 --> 36:56.650]  Yeah, my loadout on Call of Duty on zombies is different than my loadout.
[36:56.830 --> 36:57.010]  Oh, cool.
[36:57.070 --> 36:57.990]  Well, that's good to know.
[36:58.250 --> 36:59.150]  Well, that was a lot of fun.
[36:59.670 --> 37:01.930]  This is a game that I'll play with you guys.
[37:02.350 --> 37:11.030]  And I guess if I have friends who need keys jingled in their face, they would also like this game.
[37:11.570 --> 37:14.710]  This is very, there's a lot here.
[37:15.170 --> 37:18.090]  So much happens in this game all at once.
[37:18.230 --> 37:19.270]  That is crazy.
[37:19.930 --> 37:22.790]  It is definitely a learning curve to go into zombies.
[37:22.790 --> 37:24.390]  At Black Ops 6.
[37:24.870 --> 37:24.990]  Yeah.
[37:25.070 --> 37:28.270]  Have you played, have you played Warzone, Eric?
[37:28.650 --> 37:29.350]  Which one's Warzone?
[37:29.430 --> 37:33.210]  Is that, is that like, uh, the, uh, it's like that open map.
[37:33.390 --> 37:33.890]  It's okay.
[37:34.170 --> 37:34.330]  Yeah.
[37:34.330 --> 37:35.590]  It's like Fortnite, but this.
[37:36.130 --> 37:36.490]  Yeah.
[37:36.610 --> 37:37.170]  I have it not.
[37:37.310 --> 37:37.450]  No.
[37:38.090 --> 37:40.850]  That's probably the best Call of Duty game type.
[37:41.010 --> 37:41.650]  It is.
[37:42.070 --> 37:44.270]  Yeah, I watched Meg play it.
[37:45.470 --> 37:47.990]  Maybe next time we play Call of Duty, we'll play a little Warzone.
[37:48.150 --> 37:48.910]  I'm fine with that.
[37:48.950 --> 37:50.230]  I would, I would totally play that.
[37:50.290 --> 37:52.770]  Is that the one where you guys said you wanted to do stuff like ramp jump?
[37:52.790 --> 37:54.150]  And then like, yeah.
[37:54.350 --> 37:54.830]  Oh, yeah.
[37:55.510 --> 37:55.910]  Yeah.
[37:56.730 --> 37:58.670]  Well, thank you so much for watching.
[37:59.230 --> 38:01.990]  If you want to check out our podcast, it's Regulation Pod.
[38:02.490 --> 38:04.230]  We have a Patreon, the Regulation Podcast.
[38:05.630 --> 38:06.830]  All that good stuff.
[38:08.270 --> 38:08.970]  This is fun.
[38:09.250 --> 38:10.670]  I'm excited to do Warzone with you guys.
[38:12.250 --> 38:13.130]  Until then, though.
[38:13.670 --> 38:14.070]  Bye.
[38:14.570 --> 38:14.970]  Bye.
[38:16.470 --> 38:18.450]  I tried to do the outro two other times.
[38:18.630 --> 38:20.370]  It was just like somebody else has to do it, I guess.
