[00:00.000 --> 00:02.720]  Your game attack sucks, Eric. You should change it to Lil Ricky B.
[00:03.960 --> 00:05.680]  Can you change your gamer tag on Xbox?
[00:06.160 --> 00:07.840]  Oh, big time. Once for free.
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.300]  And then after that, it costs a couple bucks.
[00:09.400 --> 00:11.260]  Oh, I'll change it. I'll change it to Lil Ricky B. I don't care.
[00:11.840 --> 00:13.140]  Welcome to Human Fall Flat.
[00:13.360 --> 00:18.600]  The dog, the yellow top hat man, the chef, the other dog.
[00:18.900 --> 00:20.060]  It's a dog day afternoon.
[00:20.720 --> 00:23.240]  We're at the Aztec level because I don't think we played this.
[00:23.800 --> 00:25.540]  What are we, uh...
[00:25.540 --> 00:27.100]  I gotta put my dog down.
[00:27.620 --> 00:29.600]  Oh, your dog is fine.
[00:29.600 --> 00:31.180]  You don't have to put your dog down.
[00:31.280 --> 00:31.840]  Are you sure?
[00:32.260 --> 00:34.180]  No, I'll help. I'll help you put your dog down.
[00:34.240 --> 00:35.600]  Come on. Let's put your dog down.
[00:36.180 --> 00:37.080]  Let's go down together.
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.520]  Come on. My dog's putting me down.
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.420]  Man's best friend.
[00:42.040 --> 00:43.500]  Man's best friend.
[00:43.760 --> 00:44.760]  Yeah. Come on.
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.780]  Come on. We're putting your dog down. Let's go.
[00:47.380 --> 00:48.580]  My dog won't let go.
[00:48.680 --> 00:49.020]  Come on.
[00:50.300 --> 00:52.080]  Man's best friend.
[00:52.520 --> 00:53.460]  Albert, don't watch.
[00:53.940 --> 00:56.720]  Oh, I'm holding you up with my spine.
[00:57.200 --> 00:58.340]  Come on. Put your dog down.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.860]  Nick, chef.
[01:00.140 --> 01:01.900]  Where the hell are you? Oh, there you are.
[01:02.100 --> 01:04.140]  Nick, help us put his dog down.
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.140]  You got it.
[01:07.840 --> 01:09.840]  Come on. Come on, Gavin. Let's put your dog down.
[01:10.000 --> 01:10.380]  I missed.
[01:11.060 --> 01:11.940]  All right, the dog stays.
[01:12.460 --> 01:13.140]  Body slam!
[01:13.420 --> 01:14.660]  That was like a wrestling match.
[01:14.740 --> 01:15.740]  Great job, everybody.
[01:16.120 --> 01:17.560]  You put me down.
[01:19.260 --> 01:20.080]  What are we...
[01:20.080 --> 01:20.500]  What are we doing?
[01:21.060 --> 01:21.880]  See if you could...
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.600]  See if you could smoke this.
[01:23.600 --> 01:24.000]  It's my stick.
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.160]  It's a big cigar.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.420]  This is my stick.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.400]  Give me my stick.
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.320]  I just play fetch.
[01:30.920 --> 01:31.320]  Yep.
[01:32.020 --> 01:32.440]  Throw it.
[01:32.700 --> 01:32.820]  Throw it.
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.780]  Come on, buddy.
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.000]  Come on.
[01:36.000 --> 01:36.120]  Ready?
[01:36.480 --> 01:36.780]  Come on.
[01:36.920 --> 01:37.560]  Come on, buddy.
[01:37.640 --> 01:38.260]  Come get the stick.
[01:38.820 --> 01:39.480]  Come on, buddy.
[01:40.100 --> 01:40.480]  Throw it.
[01:40.840 --> 01:41.300]  Throw it.
[01:41.540 --> 01:41.900]  Go get it.
[01:42.880 --> 01:43.440]  Throw it.
[01:43.660 --> 01:44.540]  Go get the stick, buddy.
[01:45.100 --> 01:45.440]  Throw it.
[01:46.800 --> 01:47.360]  Throw it.
[01:47.620 --> 01:47.980]  Come on.
[01:48.000 --> 01:48.800]  Let's go get the stick.
[01:49.040 --> 01:49.720]  Throw it.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.760]  Where is it?
[01:55.660 --> 01:56.060]  Oh.
[01:56.740 --> 01:58.120]  Did you get those sticks?
[01:58.260 --> 01:58.760]  I'll fetch.
[02:00.720 --> 02:01.840]  Nick, what are you doing?
[02:02.180 --> 02:02.820]  Where'd he go?
[02:03.060 --> 02:04.060]  He's doing leverage.
[02:04.600 --> 02:05.040]  Leverage.
[02:05.620 --> 02:06.060]  Leverage.
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.440]  He's doing a pivot point and...
[02:09.440 --> 02:09.920]  Yeah!
[02:10.660 --> 02:11.100]  Fulcrum?
[02:11.860 --> 02:12.940]  Yeah, the fulcrum.
[02:13.060 --> 02:14.900]  Yeah, I fulked it up real crumbed.
[02:15.800 --> 02:16.180]  Okay.
[02:16.700 --> 02:17.280]  Yeah, good joke.
[02:18.940 --> 02:20.000]  We're going to need another one.
[02:20.160 --> 02:20.560]  All right, hold on.
[02:20.820 --> 02:21.460]  We're going to need...
[02:21.460 --> 02:22.800]  This is full of crumb.
[02:22.940 --> 02:23.480]  Full of crumb.
[02:23.540 --> 02:23.920]  Take two.
[02:25.580 --> 02:26.900]  I'm a silent bee.
[02:28.580 --> 02:29.500]  Oh, shit.
[02:29.700 --> 02:30.380]  Me and you, dog man.
[02:31.820 --> 02:33.680]  All right, Andrew, get that through there.
[02:33.860 --> 02:35.280]  We just got to wedge it here.
[02:36.040 --> 02:37.040]  What are you doing, dog?
[02:37.480 --> 02:37.880]  Getting through?
[02:38.460 --> 02:38.580]  Dog.
[02:38.580 --> 02:39.320]  Dog's going around.
[02:39.600 --> 02:40.960]  Dog on Mission Impossible.
[02:41.240 --> 02:41.380]  Dog.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.260]  Well, okay.
[02:45.340 --> 02:45.940]  All right.
[02:46.700 --> 02:47.300]  There goes the dog.
[02:47.340 --> 02:49.120]  My people eyes dog does shit like that.
[02:49.360 --> 02:50.080]  Where's my stick?
[02:50.900 --> 02:52.060]  Oh, you took the stick off the ledge?
[02:52.540 --> 02:54.240]  Oh, I have a question for you, Nick.
[02:54.340 --> 02:54.420]  Let me go.
[02:54.620 --> 02:55.740]  Let go of me, you psycho.
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.740]  You know, in the last...
[02:58.740 --> 03:00.280]  No, I'm trying to get up.
[03:00.440 --> 03:01.220]  Guys, come on.
[03:01.660 --> 03:02.400]  What do you mean?
[03:02.560 --> 03:02.860]  What's wrong?
[03:03.660 --> 03:04.720]  I'm trying to get...
[03:04.720 --> 03:05.320]  Yeah, you did it.
[03:05.560 --> 03:07.140]  I know in the last...
[03:07.140 --> 03:07.980]  You know, when we were...
[03:07.980 --> 03:10.860]  You know, I was throwing the coal off and you...
[03:10.860 --> 03:10.880]  Oh.
[03:11.540 --> 03:12.180]  You were...
[03:12.180 --> 03:12.560]  Yeah.
[03:13.060 --> 03:16.300]  Saying that it wasn't respawning and you weren't putting it on the conveyor belt, even though
[03:16.300 --> 03:19.440]  on your footage at the time you were saying that it was respawning and landing in front
[03:19.440 --> 03:19.660]  of you.
[03:19.840 --> 03:20.400]  Was that a bit?
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.260]  Yep.
[03:22.320 --> 03:22.660]  Yep.
[03:23.180 --> 03:24.200]  All right, there we go.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.060]  All right, let's do it, dog.
[03:25.540 --> 03:27.060]  Would it be better if it was or wasn't?
[03:27.300 --> 03:27.380]  Climb.
[03:28.220 --> 03:28.900]  I don't...
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.700]  I think it's better if it was.
[03:31.160 --> 03:31.420]  Climb.
[03:31.600 --> 03:31.980]  Okay, it was a bit.
[03:32.360 --> 03:33.260]  I can't...
[03:33.640 --> 03:34.560]  Get us up there.
[03:34.620 --> 03:35.060]  What are you doing?
[03:35.060 --> 03:36.340]  I think it was better for your...
[03:36.340 --> 03:38.980]  Like, his well-being of understanding you as a person.
[03:39.060 --> 03:39.900]  You're fucking...
[03:39.900 --> 03:40.720]  But funnier if it wasn't.
[03:41.060 --> 03:41.580]  What's the...
[03:41.580 --> 03:42.060]  There you go.
[03:42.060 --> 03:42.540]  You're climbing.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.060]  Climb.
[03:43.160 --> 03:43.360]  Pull.
[03:43.460 --> 03:43.900]  Pull us up.
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.660]  I think it was because I had already made up my mind when the truck went off the ledge
[03:48.660 --> 03:49.880]  and none of the coal respawned.
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.340]  Pull us up.
[03:51.100 --> 03:51.420]  Okay.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.580]  And so when you did it, I was like, well, no, I'm just not gonna...
[03:56.240 --> 03:57.720]  Yeah, without your help, we would've...
[03:57.720 --> 04:00.240]  Without your help, Eric, I would've been there and I could've...
[04:00.240 --> 04:03.400]  But it was landing next to you in your footage.
[04:03.580 --> 04:05.040]  Yeah, but here's the thing, Gavin.
[04:05.100 --> 04:05.980]  I see what I want to see.
[04:06.460 --> 04:07.180]  Okay, yeah.
[04:07.860 --> 04:08.820]  I know a lot of people like that.
[04:08.900 --> 04:09.160]  Here's the thing, Gavin.
[04:09.460 --> 04:10.300]  Shut the fuck up.
[04:14.400 --> 04:15.600]  You see, the thing about that is...
[04:15.600 --> 04:16.160]  Fuck off.
[04:18.080 --> 04:19.300]  I'm getting the real Nick experience.
[04:19.300 --> 04:19.600]  Almost made it.
[04:19.600 --> 04:20.860]  What? What do you mean?
[04:21.540 --> 04:23.020]  Where did the rest of you guys go?
[04:23.740 --> 04:26.780]  Geoff was trying to climb up or something.
[04:27.120 --> 04:28.040]  He wouldn't help.
[04:28.520 --> 04:29.540]  I'm over here.
[04:30.620 --> 04:31.800]  Where's the other doggo?
[04:33.800 --> 04:34.900]  I'm over here.
[04:36.040 --> 04:39.140]  I don't ever get to make efforts for RVB anymore, so I have to do it here.
[04:39.540 --> 04:40.720]  We're on the cage bit.
[04:41.420 --> 04:42.120]  The scales.
[04:43.980 --> 04:44.900]  Scales of fate.
[04:46.160 --> 04:47.320]  That was not a good jump.
[04:47.760 --> 04:49.520]  Geoff, you barely cleared that.
[04:49.520 --> 04:50.280]  That's not a good jump.
[04:50.540 --> 04:51.340]  I don't have hops.
[04:54.200 --> 04:55.240]  I'm Woody Harrelson.
[04:55.860 --> 04:56.560]  Great movie.
[04:57.820 --> 04:58.720]  Didn't they remake it?
[04:59.740 --> 05:01.500]  I think they did with, like, fucking...
[05:01.500 --> 05:03.160]  It's like Jack Harlow or some shit.
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.180]  Yeah, Jack Harlow.
[05:04.460 --> 05:06.060]  That dude loves to play ball.
[05:06.780 --> 05:08.040]  He's a big basketball fan.
[05:08.480 --> 05:09.400]  Yeah, but so are you.
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.600]  I wouldn't watch a movie with...
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.440]  Nah, I'd watch White Man.
[05:11.440 --> 05:13.680]  You would absolutely watch a movie.
[05:13.800 --> 05:14.260]  I would watch White Man catch up if you were in it.
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.420]  I would watch that.
[05:16.260 --> 05:16.720]  I would watch that.
[05:18.320 --> 05:18.980]  I'm wrong.
[05:20.320 --> 05:22.280]  Are we thick as shit? Oh, Andrew just fell.
[05:22.380 --> 05:23.080]  Where are we going?
[05:23.620 --> 05:24.580]  I was doing a lava thing.
[05:24.580 --> 05:25.340]  We are thick as shit.
[05:25.480 --> 05:26.440]  Oh, over here, there's a...
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.720]  We're going to Thick Town.
[05:27.980 --> 05:29.740]  Dog? Why is the dog grabbing me?
[05:30.040 --> 05:30.820]  Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.
[05:31.320 --> 05:32.560]  Oh, I see how it is.
[05:32.960 --> 05:34.080]  We have to climb on the block?
[05:34.440 --> 05:36.000]  I think we need... yeah.
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.100]  Yeah, it's like that.
[05:37.280 --> 05:37.580]  Nah.
[05:38.100 --> 05:39.000]  We'll probably have to...
[05:39.000 --> 05:39.400]  There you go.
[05:39.700 --> 05:41.520]  We'll probably have to lift this...
[05:41.520 --> 05:43.160]  Why'd you put it down there?
[05:43.860 --> 05:45.400]  We gotta bring this down.
[05:45.660 --> 05:45.860]  Oh.
[05:45.860 --> 05:46.780]  And then we'll lift it up.
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.020]  We'll raise this up higher again and... yeah, put that in the thing.
[05:51.320 --> 05:52.660]  Somebody bring this thing down.
[05:53.260 --> 05:54.440]  But how far down can that go?
[05:54.740 --> 05:55.180]  All the way.
[05:56.140 --> 05:59.120]  Alright, not all the way, but it won't lift us up to that...
[05:59.600 --> 05:59.960]  Stop...
[06:00.360 --> 06:00.940]  Yes, it will.
[06:01.280 --> 06:01.880]  It'll lift.
[06:02.480 --> 06:03.400]  Somebody needs to get on it.
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.340]  Come on, balance the scales.
[06:04.560 --> 06:05.660]  No, somebody needs to get off it.
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.280]  Uh-oh.
[06:06.340 --> 06:06.500]  Here.
[06:07.140 --> 06:08.780]  Hold on, stop, stop, stop.
[06:08.860 --> 06:09.100]  Uh-oh.
[06:09.240 --> 06:09.440]  Eric.
[06:09.820 --> 06:10.960]  Uh-oh, I'm underneath.
[06:11.340 --> 06:12.040]  You might die here.
[06:12.160 --> 06:12.580]  There we go.
[06:12.700 --> 06:12.920]  Okay.
[06:13.620 --> 06:16.160]  Okay, now we need to go to the other scale.
[06:16.280 --> 06:16.520]  Stop.
[06:16.940 --> 06:17.380]  Okay.
[06:17.800 --> 06:18.760]  That was helpful.
[06:18.980 --> 06:19.700]  Okay, thank you.
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.840]  Yeah, other scale.
[06:24.160 --> 06:30.100]  Oh, I got an achievement for traveling 10 kilometers.
[06:30.880 --> 06:31.180]  Okay.
[06:31.580 --> 06:32.200]  Now raise it.
[06:32.820 --> 06:33.300]  Hi, guys.
[06:34.060 --> 06:34.500]  Hi.
[06:34.900 --> 06:36.800]  Alright, now everybody else get on that.
[06:37.260 --> 06:37.800]  Everybody... here.
[06:38.180 --> 06:39.640]  White dog, you stay on that.
[06:39.820 --> 06:42.060]  Everybody else get in here with the box and we'll raise it.
[06:42.060 --> 06:43.700]  I don't know why we brought race into it.
[06:43.700 --> 06:44.260]  White Fang.
[06:45.200 --> 06:45.760]  What do you mean?
[06:45.860 --> 06:46.960]  We'll just bring it over here.
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.660]  Oh, we can do that too.
[06:50.020 --> 06:50.940]  We can do that too.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.160]  That's the nice thing about this game is there's so many different ways to do it.
[06:55.340 --> 06:57.120]  I think for each part we should have...
[06:57.120 --> 06:58.140]  And everybody's way is valid.
[06:58.400 --> 07:01.480]  We should have one foreman per part and they're in charge.
[07:01.740 --> 07:02.680]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.780]  I kind of like the way we're doing it where it's just a fucking mess.
[07:06.160 --> 07:06.380]  Okay.
[07:06.540 --> 07:09.520]  Oh, you don't think it'll be a mess when one person is directing the whole time?
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.240]  Yeah, no shit.
[07:10.240 --> 07:13.040]  All right, who's in charge of this round?
[07:13.500 --> 07:13.920]  That's my face.
[07:13.920 --> 07:14.060]  Did you do it?
[07:15.020 --> 07:15.720]  Oh, it's a real mustache.
[07:15.960 --> 07:17.660]  I thought I was just testing to see if it was real.
[07:17.840 --> 07:18.620]  It's a real mustache.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.040]  Let's check his mustache.
[07:20.260 --> 07:20.360]  Come here.
[07:20.660 --> 07:25.600]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[07:25.620 --> 07:26.280]  I'm a chef.
[07:27.260 --> 07:27.680]  Okay.
[07:28.700 --> 07:29.320]  You've grabbed my back pockets.
[07:29.320 --> 07:30.360]  You grabbed the other dog.
[07:30.780 --> 07:31.280]  My keys.
[07:31.280 --> 07:32.340]  You grabbed the other dog.
[07:32.420 --> 07:32.820]  Climb up.
[07:32.820 --> 07:33.480]  My keys.
[07:33.920 --> 07:34.420]  Nick, climb.
[07:35.800 --> 07:36.960]  Geoff, come back.
[07:37.280 --> 07:37.380]  What is a seesaw?
[07:38.560 --> 07:38.980]  Seesaw?
[07:38.980 --> 07:39.980]  Oh, no.
[07:40.000 --> 07:40.880]  Geoff, we need you.
[07:41.300 --> 07:41.940]  I can't.
[07:42.100 --> 07:42.880]  I'm hanging on the side.
[07:42.980 --> 07:43.960]  Oh, I'm gonna die.
[07:44.340 --> 07:45.000]  Oh, that's it.
[07:45.100 --> 07:45.460]  Don't worry, Geoff.
[07:45.480 --> 07:46.060]  I'll rescue you.
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.500]  Death's sweet embrace.
[07:48.880 --> 07:50.300]  Oh, I fell down the stairs.
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.520]  I bonked my head.
[07:51.600 --> 07:52.460]  I can't get my hand out.
[07:55.920 --> 07:56.900]  What's the thing in here, bud?
[07:56.960 --> 07:57.140]  I'm trying.
[07:57.720 --> 08:02.660]  I don't know, but there's a companion cube over there.
[08:02.720 --> 08:03.560]  There's a big cigarette.
[08:04.020 --> 08:05.400]  There's a companion cube.
[08:07.000 --> 08:07.560]  Get him.
[08:08.760 --> 08:16.860]  If I stand on this backside, can you go up on the other side of the seesaw?
[08:16.980 --> 08:17.920]  Gavin, let go of him.
[08:17.960 --> 08:18.560]  He's dead weight.
[08:19.420 --> 08:21.880]  And then you climb up, maybe?
[08:22.780 --> 08:23.320]  Whoa.
[08:24.100 --> 08:24.640]  Whoa.
[08:25.180 --> 08:25.640]  That was crazy.
[08:26.660 --> 08:27.360]  Andrew, jump.
[08:27.540 --> 08:28.200]  Jump off the cube.
[08:28.460 --> 08:29.900]  Andrew, use the cube.
[08:30.420 --> 08:31.080]  I'm trying.
[08:31.380 --> 08:31.880]  Use the cube.
[08:33.020 --> 08:33.980]  Gavin, swerve.
[08:34.240 --> 08:34.820]  Swerve left.
[08:35.440 --> 08:35.980]  Swerve?
[08:36.420 --> 08:36.680]  Yep.
[08:36.680 --> 08:38.160]  Touch the old spark.
[08:38.320 --> 08:39.780]  We gotta go up and around it.
[08:41.040 --> 08:41.840]  Oh, no.
[08:42.120 --> 08:42.600]  Oh, no.
[08:42.680 --> 08:44.900]  I think the idea is sound.
[08:45.000 --> 08:45.920]  I just missed the jump.
[08:46.080 --> 08:47.680]  Why don't you try while I'm on it?
[08:48.320 --> 08:51.040]  It might take two people on the bike to balance the weight out.
[08:51.120 --> 08:51.640]  I think so, too.
[08:51.980 --> 08:54.520]  But I think we're also... I think we're missing something.
[08:54.540 --> 08:55.220]  Missing something?
[08:55.340 --> 08:55.980]  Missing a step?
[08:56.220 --> 08:56.820]  Grab my head.
[08:57.140 --> 08:57.300]  Okay.
[08:57.940 --> 08:58.800]  Grab the hat.
[08:59.740 --> 09:00.580]  Okay, and then...
[09:00.580 --> 09:00.760]  Nope.
[09:02.460 --> 09:04.240]  We gotta put both hands in.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.080]  Gavin, why did you let go?
[09:06.080 --> 09:07.840]  Well, I didn't wanna...
[09:07.840 --> 09:08.860]  Okay, hold on.
[09:09.140 --> 09:10.180]  Yeah, there's something we're missing.
[09:10.180 --> 09:10.440]  I can get you.
[09:10.720 --> 09:12.420]  I can get you.
[09:12.460 --> 09:13.620]  Made it so much harder.
[09:13.780 --> 09:14.240]  I can get you.
[09:14.240 --> 09:14.980]  Oh, Mick.
[09:15.280 --> 09:15.680]  Mick.
[09:15.860 --> 09:16.220]  I got him.
[09:16.680 --> 09:17.700]  You're so close.
[09:17.820 --> 09:18.120]  I know.
[09:18.580 --> 09:18.880]  I know.
[09:19.760 --> 09:20.220]  I know.
[09:21.040 --> 09:21.480]  Come on.
[09:21.540 --> 09:21.880]  You know what?
[09:22.240 --> 09:23.820]  We can already climb up, can't we?
[09:24.660 --> 09:25.020]  Yeah.
[09:25.060 --> 09:25.380]  Go.
[09:26.060 --> 09:27.000]  You're so close.
[09:28.080 --> 09:29.140]  Yes, we got him.
[09:29.780 --> 09:30.640]  Oh, shit.
[09:30.980 --> 09:32.800]  I can just walk up here.
[09:33.060 --> 09:33.280]  Woo.
[09:33.640 --> 09:33.820]  Yeah.
[09:34.080 --> 09:34.780]  And then you're good.
[09:34.780 --> 09:35.960]  I'm up here to cross.
[09:36.500 --> 09:37.140]  I think you're right.
[09:37.220 --> 09:37.820]  I think you're right.
[09:39.360 --> 09:43.260]  Why don't you put it on the end where...
[09:43.260 --> 09:44.660]  that's closest to me?
[09:44.940 --> 09:47.440]  And then stand on the far end to see if I can...
[09:47.440 --> 09:49.040]  I don't think I can grab it that way, can I?
[09:49.400 --> 09:49.720]  Ah!
[09:50.320 --> 09:51.420]  Oh, you shouldn't have grabbed me, Nick.
[09:52.460 --> 09:53.240]  I didn't see you.
[09:56.720 --> 09:58.100]  How can I pick this up?
[09:58.940 --> 09:59.280]  Oh.
[10:00.920 --> 10:03.980]  Yeah, I think you just have to pick it up, like, the long way.
[10:05.580 --> 10:07.200]  I'll stand at the bottom here.
[10:08.380 --> 10:10.560]  I think Andrew maybe just solved it.
[10:11.880 --> 10:14.260]  Are you talking about, like, weighing down Geoff's end?
[10:14.320 --> 10:14.780]  Did you grab it?
[10:14.920 --> 10:17.160]  No, I'm trying to get this stick.
[10:17.880 --> 10:20.220]  Let me know when to let go.
[10:21.420 --> 10:21.800]  No!
[10:23.400 --> 10:24.360]  Alright, I like it.
[10:24.440 --> 10:25.440]  Grab my foot!
[10:26.840 --> 10:28.460]  Alright, right arm down.
[10:28.940 --> 10:30.160]  That's a bad spot for you, dude.
[10:30.160 --> 10:31.780]  Yeah, man, I'm not loving this.
[10:32.200 --> 10:33.320]  You seem to be trapped.
[10:33.320 --> 10:36.020]  Yeah, I don't know why you held on to the stick for so long.
[10:36.080 --> 10:38.220]  That was a very interesting move.
[10:38.220 --> 10:38.720]  Because clearly...
[10:40.780 --> 10:41.420]  Oh, balls.
[10:41.820 --> 10:42.440]  I'm under one hand.
[10:42.940 --> 10:45.480]  Well, if it doesn't get better, Geoff, we can just move on.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.040]  Yeah, I'm already over there.
[10:47.580 --> 10:49.380]  Apparently, you just gotta jump good.
[10:49.820 --> 10:52.900]  Well, you stand on one end of the seesaw, then other people can jump over the gap.
[10:53.420 --> 10:54.060]  Jump on you.
[10:55.120 --> 10:56.000]  Jump over your gap.
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.140]  Oh, wow!
[10:59.860 --> 11:00.560]  That was awesome.
[11:00.740 --> 11:01.180]  That was nice, dude.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.660]  That was pretty cool.
[11:02.660 --> 11:03.500]  Wow!
[11:03.880 --> 11:05.680]  And then that's like a platform or something?
[11:05.820 --> 11:06.300]  Oh, Andrew.
[11:06.760 --> 11:07.380]  Andrew, let go!
[11:07.560 --> 11:08.340]  Drop! Drop! Drop!
[11:08.620 --> 11:08.820]  Drop, fool!
[11:08.920 --> 11:10.420]  No, you missed it.
[11:10.540 --> 11:10.860]  Drop!
[11:11.840 --> 11:12.200]  There you go.
[11:12.460 --> 11:12.720]  There we go.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.660]  Alright, and now what?
[11:19.640 --> 11:20.080]  Nope.
[11:26.140 --> 11:27.020]  Me too.
[11:27.820 --> 11:28.420]  There we go.
[11:28.540 --> 11:29.540]  Hey, all of us together.
[11:30.320 --> 11:31.240]  Now, why did we do this?
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.360]  I don't know.
[11:32.500 --> 11:33.700]  Swing it over right, maybe?
[11:33.720 --> 11:33.780]  Fulcrum.
[11:33.900 --> 11:34.340]  There you go.
[11:34.600 --> 11:36.060]  Oh, you got me!
[11:37.020 --> 11:38.540]  Oh, I can see Nick's shoes!
[11:38.900 --> 11:39.020]  Oh!
[11:39.020 --> 11:40.000]  Where are you?
[11:40.080 --> 11:40.420]  Why am I over here?
[11:41.200 --> 11:41.880]  Nick, I'm underneath!
[11:42.420 --> 11:42.720]  You are?
[11:43.400 --> 11:43.760]  Yeah.
[11:45.460 --> 11:46.560]  Did you see me?
[11:46.760 --> 11:47.000]  No.
[11:47.640 --> 11:47.820]  Oh.
[11:48.100 --> 11:48.920]  Andrew, what are we doing?
[11:49.680 --> 11:50.100]  Alright, okay.
[11:50.160 --> 11:51.580]  Andrew, what is he doing?
[11:52.040 --> 11:52.500]  I don't know.
[11:55.700 --> 11:56.220]  Oh, there he is!
[11:56.520 --> 11:57.100]  Andrew, by God!
[11:57.280 --> 11:58.060]  Totally quiet.
[11:58.240 --> 11:59.580]  I don't trust it at all.
[12:00.080 --> 12:00.560]  I don't know.
[12:00.560 --> 12:01.780]  I don't know how quiet Andrew is at all.
[12:01.780 --> 12:02.380]  I don't know what's happening.
[12:03.760 --> 12:04.940]  I don't know what's going on here.
[12:05.220 --> 12:06.240]  Andrew's, like, stuck?
[12:06.740 --> 12:07.820]  Yeah, I don't know what's happening.
[12:08.360 --> 12:09.320]  You're, like, messed up.
[12:09.700 --> 12:10.540]  You're asking me where to go?
[12:10.580 --> 12:10.960]  I don't know.
[12:11.440 --> 12:12.500]  You're, like, messed up, dude.
[12:12.620 --> 12:12.900]  Oh!
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.600]  I think we need to swing this thing around so that...
[12:17.600 --> 12:18.580]  Oh, right.
[12:19.020 --> 12:19.480]  Solved it.
[12:20.200 --> 12:20.640]  Okay.
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.200]  Andrew solved it.
[12:23.600 --> 12:23.900]  Easy.
[12:25.080 --> 12:25.740]  No problem.
[12:26.320 --> 12:27.240]  Top dog on the case.
[12:27.520 --> 12:28.200]  Down I go.
[12:30.120 --> 12:30.680]  White Fang.
[12:31.700 --> 12:31.980]  Oh!
[12:32.820 --> 12:33.500]  I need a hand.
[12:33.640 --> 12:34.140]  Can someone help me?
[12:34.660 --> 12:35.380]  You need a hand?
[12:35.480 --> 12:35.980]  I'm coming back.
[12:36.220 --> 12:36.920]  I'm by the water.
[12:37.260 --> 12:38.620]  What do we...
[12:38.620 --> 12:39.000]  Hey, bud.
[12:39.240 --> 12:39.500]  I don't know.
[12:39.540 --> 12:40.080]  Let's do it together.
[12:40.580 --> 12:40.760]  Okay.
[12:41.740 --> 12:42.800]  There's a giant ball!
[12:42.900 --> 12:43.740]  Yeah, we gotta go get it.
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.880]  We gotta go get the giant ball, Nick.
[12:44.980 --> 12:45.600]  Well, it fell down.
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.540]  Oh, are we going after it?
[12:46.880 --> 12:47.360]  Yeah, let's go.
[12:48.040 --> 12:48.280]  Yeah!
[12:50.140 --> 12:51.420]  Do you think you can run across that?
[12:51.600 --> 12:51.620]  Boom!
[12:51.720 --> 12:52.360]  Oh, my God.
[12:52.900 --> 12:53.460]  Oh, snap.
[12:53.740 --> 12:54.120]  Oh, hey, Geoff.
[12:55.880 --> 12:56.160]  Um...
[12:56.480 --> 12:56.760]  Geronies!
[12:56.760 --> 12:57.360]  Oof!
[12:57.520 --> 12:57.860]  Oof!
[12:58.060 --> 13:00.060]  Can we go up this?
[13:01.800 --> 13:02.760]  I'm going for the ball!
[13:03.840 --> 13:04.520]  I missed.
[13:04.700 --> 13:04.960]  Up!
[13:09.160 --> 13:10.900]  I think we can do this.
[13:10.940 --> 13:12.020]  So, there's a block right here.
[13:12.100 --> 13:13.520]  I assume we do something with this, yeah?
[13:14.060 --> 13:14.540]  Oh, shit.
[13:14.580 --> 13:15.640]  Can I try and catch the ball?
[13:16.100 --> 13:16.960]  Do the, uh...
[13:16.960 --> 13:17.780]  Do what I just did.
[13:18.100 --> 13:18.300]  Oh.
[13:18.660 --> 13:19.040]  Oh!
[13:20.160 --> 13:21.200]  Maybe that'll do something.
[13:21.720 --> 13:21.960]  Oh.
[13:22.260 --> 13:22.540]  Oh.
[13:23.080 --> 13:23.660]  Oh, no!
[13:24.100 --> 13:25.120]  When does the ball come back?
[13:26.100 --> 13:26.700]  In a second.
[13:26.700 --> 13:28.240]  I think it takes a little while.
[13:28.480 --> 13:29.180]  It's about to.
[13:29.360 --> 13:30.680]  I'm going to try and catch it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:31.540]  All right.
[13:33.200 --> 13:33.960]  Here it is.
[13:34.940 --> 13:35.620]  Here it comes.
[13:35.760 --> 13:36.260]  Oh, here it comes.
[13:36.460 --> 13:37.860]  I'm going to hold this up just a little bit.
[13:37.940 --> 13:39.800]  We'll see if we can angle it just enough to...
[13:39.800 --> 13:40.160]  I'm going to die.
[13:40.160 --> 13:40.480]  Oh!
[13:40.940 --> 13:41.480]  Got it!
[13:41.660 --> 13:42.300]  I got it!
[13:42.640 --> 13:43.180]  We did it!
[13:43.180 --> 13:43.240]  Ah!
[13:43.460 --> 13:44.060]  We got it!
[13:44.520 --> 13:44.880]  Ah!
[13:45.160 --> 13:45.700]  Hell, yeah.
[13:46.620 --> 13:47.460]  Oh, try to hold it.
[13:47.620 --> 13:48.180]  Try to hold it.
[13:49.800 --> 13:50.860]  Hold on, boys!
[13:51.340 --> 13:51.600]  Oh!
[13:52.480 --> 13:53.080]  Oh, no!
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.720]  Oh, it threw me off!
[13:57.320 --> 13:57.780]  Gavin!
[13:58.060 --> 13:59.080]  There's just a ledge!
[13:59.860 --> 14:00.100]  Where?
[14:00.640 --> 14:01.020]  There!
[14:02.660 --> 14:04.740]  Oh, I think we need to get to that platform.
[14:07.380 --> 14:08.380]  That would make sense.
[14:08.600 --> 14:09.100]  This one, right?
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.900]  What's all the way down here?
[14:15.360 --> 14:15.820]  So...
[14:15.820 --> 14:16.580]  Here it goes again.
[14:17.240 --> 14:18.100]  What are you doing, Chef?
[14:18.700 --> 14:20.720]  I'm trying to figure out the...
[14:20.720 --> 14:20.980]  Uh-oh.
[14:22.140 --> 14:23.480]  I think you might have...
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.160]  I think we might have fucked ourselves.
[14:25.540 --> 14:26.940]  I think you might be right.
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.160]  Where's the ball?
[14:29.400 --> 14:30.780]  That dropped the ball the wrong way.
[14:30.940 --> 14:31.340]  Oh!
[14:32.560 --> 14:33.320]  We can die.
[14:33.760 --> 14:34.340]  Yeah, we...
[14:34.340 --> 14:34.560]  Oh!
[14:36.460 --> 14:40.520]  Well, if the ball hits the sticks, could it ping you across the map?
[14:41.300 --> 14:41.900]  Oh, interesting.
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.280]  If you hold the back of the stick.
[14:43.640 --> 14:45.680]  Yeah, that was the...
[14:45.680 --> 14:46.640]  That was a good thought.
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.660]  Okay, well, somebody has to hold it just enough to where it catches the stick.
[14:50.660 --> 14:53.420]  Yeah, someone grab the back of the stick and someone just bend the stick over.
[14:53.720 --> 14:54.360]  Oh, Eric fell.
[14:55.320 --> 14:56.780]  Let me pull the stick out.
[14:57.720 --> 15:00.080]  And then we'll see if it works like a little catapult.
[15:01.160 --> 15:01.520]  Cool.
[15:01.680 --> 15:01.880]  Yeah.
[15:02.860 --> 15:06.120]  Yeah, so get the stick into the hitting zone, and then someone grab the back of the stick.
[15:09.500 --> 15:11.200]  We need to lift it a little bit, though.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.360]  So, like, right about here.
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.700]  Yeah, there you go.
[15:16.360 --> 15:19.200]  And then when the stick gets hit, Chef let go.
[15:20.940 --> 15:24.360]  You look like a crazed instructor on my screen.
[15:24.480 --> 15:24.940]  Oh, I'm ready.
[15:25.040 --> 15:25.800]  Where you're standing, Gavin.
[15:27.720 --> 15:29.460]  I'm going to hold up the number when it happens.
[15:30.140 --> 15:32.520]  I'm going to trust this because the other dog is holding it.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.140]  Here it comes.
[15:33.800 --> 15:34.260]  Here we go.
[15:36.360 --> 15:36.800]  Steady.
[15:39.120 --> 15:39.560]  Whoa!
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.360]  No, the brown dog did not let go.
[15:44.620 --> 15:45.540]  You gotta let go.
[15:45.800 --> 15:46.540]  Brown dog did not let go.
[15:46.540 --> 15:47.380]  I let go.
[15:47.720 --> 15:48.900]  Eric grabbed on to me.
[15:48.920 --> 15:50.280]  Brown dog did not let go.
[15:50.280 --> 15:51.400]  I let go.
[15:51.440 --> 15:52.360]  Why don't you stand on it?
[15:52.880 --> 15:53.060]  See?
[15:53.260 --> 15:54.000]  That's why I'm not touching it.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.100]  Stand on it this time.
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.120]  See if that makes a difference.
[15:59.100 --> 15:59.380]  Yeah.
[15:59.620 --> 16:00.120]  Great idea.
[16:01.700 --> 16:02.060]  Oh!
[16:02.300 --> 16:02.480]  Nope.
[16:03.140 --> 16:06.360]  Well, that wasn't quite... that wasn't in the slam zone.
[16:07.240 --> 16:07.760]  Alright, hold on.
[16:07.840 --> 16:08.640]  Let me lift this up.
[16:10.140 --> 16:11.420]  This should be the slam zone.
[16:12.020 --> 16:12.300]  Alright.
[16:12.540 --> 16:12.840]  No one's on it.
[16:12.840 --> 16:13.980]  You guys in the slam zone right now?
[16:14.560 --> 16:16.020]  Somebody going to get on the slammer?
[16:16.680 --> 16:17.640]  Andrew, get on the slammer.
[16:17.820 --> 16:18.400]  Hey, you did it.
[16:19.200 --> 16:19.560]  Well...
[16:24.260 --> 16:26.300]  Did he spawn the ball because he did that?
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.500]  Actually, we've advanced to the next area.
[16:29.760 --> 16:30.760]  That'd be real tragic.
[16:30.940 --> 16:31.220]  Oh no!
[16:31.300 --> 16:31.720]  Here he comes!
[16:31.800 --> 16:32.400]  Here he comes!
[16:32.600 --> 16:32.860]  What?
[16:34.440 --> 16:35.400]  I got this block.
[16:36.920 --> 16:37.420]  I got this...
[16:37.980 --> 16:38.340]  Board.
[16:38.620 --> 16:39.960]  Yeah, I used the board to get the block.
[16:40.300 --> 16:40.600]  Okay, Gavin.
[16:41.040 --> 16:41.680]  You do that.
[16:42.340 --> 16:44.200]  Well, we don't actually need someone to hold the stick.
[16:44.240 --> 16:45.420]  We could just have the block under it.
[16:45.440 --> 16:46.220]  Let's see where it takes me.
[16:46.640 --> 16:46.740]  Oh!
[16:47.480 --> 16:48.040]  Fuck!
[16:48.680 --> 16:50.020]  It's crushing me!
[16:50.580 --> 16:50.940]  Good.
[16:51.440 --> 16:53.200]  Alright, I'm going to see if this sends me.
[16:58.940 --> 16:59.460]  Alright.
[16:59.800 --> 17:01.180]  Next ball, this could work.
[17:03.460 --> 17:09.330]  Okay, I got a pretty good shot of this.
[17:10.790 --> 17:11.730]  See you later, guys!
[17:11.990 --> 17:12.210]  Okay.
[17:12.570 --> 17:12.770]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[17:12.770 --> 17:13.430]  I'm going to the moon!
[17:13.890 --> 17:14.870]  Bye, Gavin!
[17:15.210 --> 17:16.090]  Full send!
[17:16.410 --> 17:17.430]  Oh my god!
[17:17.990 --> 17:18.130]  Oh!
[17:19.450 --> 17:21.650]  You went two feet forward.
[17:24.810 --> 17:26.070]  Well, alright.
[17:27.430 --> 17:41.470]  I think what we're supposed to do is take this plank and put it across this gap and use the...
[17:41.470 --> 17:42.770]  I'm going for another one!
[17:42.970 --> 17:43.730]  Companion cube.
[17:43.730 --> 17:45.650]  Yeah, the cube is the weight in the back.
[17:46.210 --> 17:46.610]  Here we go!
[17:48.150 --> 17:49.290]  Didn't work, Gavin.
[17:49.610 --> 17:51.490]  I think that's the wrong gap, boys.
[17:51.490 --> 17:52.130]  Oh.
[17:52.570 --> 17:53.610]  Yeah, that's bad.
[17:53.770 --> 17:57.670]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know why you went that way at all, but that's pretty cool, I guess.
[17:58.810 --> 17:59.190]  You died.
[18:01.930 --> 18:03.890]  Because I think that this needs to go...
[18:03.890 --> 18:05.090]  Do you think that's long enough to reach that?
[18:06.290 --> 18:06.730]  Maybe.
[18:07.010 --> 18:08.910]  I don't know, but I think it has to be...
[18:08.910 --> 18:14.110]  I think it's a weighted thing where it has to be, like, pushed across with that on this backside.
[18:14.690 --> 18:15.510]  You can try it.
[18:15.610 --> 18:16.050]  Oh.
[18:16.450 --> 18:16.910]  Let's see.
[18:17.010 --> 18:17.370]  I see what you're saying.
[18:18.810 --> 18:19.130]  Huh?
[18:19.370 --> 18:20.430]  Because I'm going to fall off.
[18:20.430 --> 18:22.110]  Yeah, at least I'll get it close.
[18:22.550 --> 18:22.630]  Yeah.
[18:23.030 --> 18:24.510]  But, like, keep pushing it.
[18:25.510 --> 18:26.190]  Help me push.
[18:26.470 --> 18:26.870]  There you go.
[18:27.190 --> 18:27.690]  You just have to...
[18:27.690 --> 18:28.750]  I think that's what we have to...
[18:28.750 --> 18:30.510]  You have to get close and then make the jump, maybe.
[18:31.150 --> 18:31.270]  We're doing this all wrong.
[18:31.270 --> 18:32.070]  We're doing this all wrong.
[18:32.230 --> 18:32.550]  And I think...
[18:32.550 --> 18:33.550]  Oh, you know what?
[18:33.670 --> 18:35.030]  I think that's what this other block's for.
[18:35.110 --> 18:36.130]  I think we need two blocks.
[18:37.190 --> 18:37.810]  For the weight?
[18:38.290 --> 18:38.530]  Yeah.
[18:38.850 --> 18:39.630]  I think we're doing this all right.
[18:39.630 --> 18:40.050]  Well, that's...
[18:40.050 --> 18:40.790]  I mean, why are you...
[18:40.790 --> 18:41.470]  Don't do that.
[18:42.090 --> 18:42.770]  I'm not trying to.
[18:42.790 --> 18:43.310]  I'm trying to pull it...
[18:43.310 --> 18:44.030]  I'm trying to hold it down.
[18:44.090 --> 18:44.550]  It's just too far.
[18:44.590 --> 18:46.250]  See if you can push the block further back on the thing.
[18:47.390 --> 18:48.190]  Or pull...
[18:48.190 --> 18:48.370]  There you go.
[18:48.530 --> 18:49.650]  I don't think this is right at all.
[18:49.730 --> 18:50.930]  I think we're supposed to put it under this.
[18:51.530 --> 18:51.890]  No, no, no.
[18:52.070 --> 18:52.470]  That's...
[18:52.470 --> 18:56.050]  Andrew, I already did that to get the cube that was across the other way.
[18:56.410 --> 18:56.710]  Help me.
[18:56.770 --> 18:56.970]  Got it.
[18:57.190 --> 18:57.490]  Help me.
[18:57.850 --> 18:59.590]  The cube was...
[18:59.590 --> 19:00.530]  That's why it keeps spawning right here.
[19:00.530 --> 19:01.950]  Andrew, please help me.
[19:02.490 --> 19:03.090]  Oh, okay.
[19:03.170 --> 19:04.050]  Well, you didn't ask for help.
[19:04.150 --> 19:04.450]  How was I supposed to help you?
[19:04.450 --> 19:05.770]  I said help me, please.
[19:06.350 --> 19:07.770]  You're insane, Andrew.
[19:08.190 --> 19:09.210]  I didn't hear anything.
[19:09.590 --> 19:10.210]  I think...
[19:10.210 --> 19:12.450]  I think both of the cubes maybe need to be...
[19:13.130 --> 19:15.170]  I don't think this is long enough.
[19:15.170 --> 19:17.490]  Do we have to just go do something with the ball?
[19:17.730 --> 19:18.450]  I think it's the ball.
[19:18.690 --> 19:20.330]  Yeah, I think maybe we bring it back to the ball.
[19:20.390 --> 19:23.470]  I think we can do both and just pick which one we want to do.
[19:23.470 --> 19:26.250]  Wait, do you think the cube comes over this way?
[19:26.770 --> 19:27.490]  Good luck with that.
[19:28.730 --> 19:29.510]  We need it.
[19:29.670 --> 19:30.330]  We need the ball.
[19:30.410 --> 19:30.870]  We need it.
[19:31.390 --> 19:31.970]  It'll respawn.
[19:32.210 --> 19:33.510]  Yeah, let go, dipshit.
[19:34.590 --> 19:39.650]  I think you might just need to ride the ball till you can jump off on the right there.
[19:40.010 --> 19:42.370]  Yeah, I think we use both cubes on the wood sticks.
[19:42.610 --> 19:44.450]  I think Andrew's right.
[19:44.450 --> 19:46.890]  I think the point of the...
[19:47.510 --> 19:52.610]  The long plank is to put it here where I am so you can get the cube across.
[19:52.870 --> 19:57.850]  And then it's the cubes over here to ride this stuff.
[19:58.390 --> 20:00.130]  But there's this path over here.
[20:01.110 --> 20:02.210]  Through the mountain.
[20:02.690 --> 20:03.630]  The mountain path.
[20:04.250 --> 20:06.510]  I think it's gotta be this, but I'm not sure.
[20:07.070 --> 20:08.470]  Alright, let's...
[20:08.470 --> 20:09.050]  Why?
[20:09.710 --> 20:10.270]  Why?
[20:10.610 --> 20:11.150]  Why?
[20:11.710 --> 20:12.510]  I missed my jump.
[20:12.630 --> 20:13.850]  Yeah, cause you grabbed me!
[20:13.850 --> 20:16.010]  What if we try a full group send?
[20:17.070 --> 20:19.530]  Where we put the plank across the top of the sticks.
[20:20.670 --> 20:21.110]  Oh!
[20:21.750 --> 20:23.410]  With the cube on each thing.
[20:23.830 --> 20:25.410]  And we can do a full fiver.
[20:25.910 --> 20:27.790]  That's nuts. I think that's nuts.
[20:27.950 --> 20:28.710]  Let's do it.
[20:29.450 --> 20:34.790]  I'm gonna try to run on top of this ball and then jump off on the right there to advance.
[20:35.490 --> 20:37.410]  You're gonna jump over here?
[20:38.150 --> 20:39.210]  I think I'm gonna try... yeah.
[20:39.730 --> 20:41.090]  Oh, that's good.
[20:41.090 --> 20:41.490]  That's good.
[20:42.310 --> 20:44.630]  Hold on, let me readjust it.
[20:44.850 --> 20:45.810]  Just so it's in line.
[20:48.310 --> 20:51.730]  Pull back, pull back, pull back.
[20:52.550 --> 20:54.150]  Oh, interesting. Someone needs help.
[20:54.930 --> 20:55.430]  Pull back.
[20:55.890 --> 20:57.090]  Well, just say you need help.
[20:58.250 --> 20:58.810]  Pull back.
[20:59.090 --> 20:59.910]  Why didn't you just say something?
[21:00.110 --> 21:00.830]  Pull back isn't help.
[21:00.850 --> 21:02.350]  In my defense, I am a dog.
[21:04.570 --> 21:06.350]  Andrew, grab this side, where I am.
[21:06.650 --> 21:07.470]  How did I miss?
[21:07.530 --> 21:07.830]  One sec.
[21:08.250 --> 21:08.610]  Okay.
[21:09.170 --> 21:09.650]  Coming back.
[21:09.650 --> 21:10.190]  Okay.
[21:10.390 --> 21:11.030]  Oh, there you are.
[21:11.330 --> 21:12.030]  Oh, there's Eric.
[21:12.590 --> 21:12.990]  Okay.
[21:13.850 --> 21:16.530]  Yeah, come grab it just the opposite of me and we can just lift it together.
[21:17.510 --> 21:18.010]  Well, maybe.
[21:20.450 --> 21:21.790]  Where are you hoping to go?
[21:22.350 --> 21:23.390]  Just across the... oh.
[21:24.090 --> 21:29.590]  Over here to the right, you can see there's a... like a cave that you can cut through.
[21:29.810 --> 21:32.170]  I was hoping to ride the ball.
[21:32.650 --> 21:34.770]  I saw somebody ride it initially. I thought it was cool.
[21:34.770 --> 21:41.150]  I was going to try to ride the... if I could grab onto it, maybe I could be on top of it and then just...
[21:41.150 --> 21:42.270]  Why don't you just start from over here?
[21:43.250 --> 21:44.010]  Could do that too.
[21:44.630 --> 21:45.830]  I wonder if I could start from over here.
[21:45.930 --> 21:49.570]  Yeah, I was thinking you might be in a pretty good position where you're at.
[21:50.110 --> 21:51.790]  Oh, I don't think you... good luck climbing that.
[21:51.890 --> 21:52.230]  Oh, yeah.
[21:53.310 --> 21:54.650]  It was angled, so I thought maybe.
[21:56.390 --> 21:56.970]  How's it going?
[21:57.270 --> 21:58.390]  I'll just counterweight it.
[21:59.430 --> 22:00.910]  Almost, almost, almost.
[22:01.070 --> 22:03.350]  Oh, I think it's almost there.
[22:03.510 --> 22:04.430]  It might be over there.
[22:04.850 --> 22:05.830]  I think you got it.
[22:05.970 --> 22:06.870]  I'll go check. No, it's just off.
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.910]  You don't have it. You don't have it. You don't have it.
[22:08.950 --> 22:10.410]  Do you want me to grab this?
[22:10.570 --> 22:11.650]  Yeah, please do.
[22:12.030 --> 22:12.410]  We'll pull.
[22:12.870 --> 22:13.650]  Alright, you got it. Perfect.
[22:14.030 --> 22:14.450]  There you go.
[22:14.770 --> 22:15.210]  Thank you.
[22:15.410 --> 22:15.610]  Bridge complete.
[22:16.710 --> 22:17.750]  Oh, that took longer than it needed.
[22:19.190 --> 22:20.490]  Get that other cube.
[22:23.570 --> 22:26.790]  Oh, so you're bringing the cube over. I thought we were doing the other thing, sorry.
[22:27.570 --> 22:28.070]  What thing?
[22:29.050 --> 22:34.750]  The initial idea that Eric had where we were using the cubes to balance the beam to get across to the right.
[22:34.890 --> 22:38.250]  I thought that's what we were going to do, but you guys seem to have an idea.
[22:40.910 --> 22:42.610]  I thought we were doing the full launch.
[22:43.350 --> 22:44.130]  Yeah, group launch.
[22:44.830 --> 22:46.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Geoff, group launch.
[22:47.210 --> 22:47.950]  Group launch, got it.
[22:48.130 --> 22:49.630]  Andrew took the other block out for some reason.
[22:50.170 --> 22:50.650]  No, I didn't.
[22:51.030 --> 22:51.710]  Yeah, yeah, Andrew did.
[22:51.750 --> 22:53.090]  Oh, Geoff took the other block out for me.
[22:53.990 --> 22:57.830]  I mean, I just had a whole fucking conversation where I apologized for doing it.
[22:57.830 --> 22:59.350]  Because I misunderstood what we were doing.
[22:59.410 --> 22:59.730]  Andrew!
[23:00.250 --> 23:01.650]  I just hate blocks.
[23:01.810 --> 23:03.270]  All right, somebody get the other block over here.
[23:04.230 --> 23:05.050]  All right, there you go.
[23:05.710 --> 23:06.030]  Okay.
[23:07.170 --> 23:09.790]  We might be in a situation where this might be glitched.
[23:10.290 --> 23:10.610]  What?
[23:11.250 --> 23:12.250]  Oh, nope, there we go.
[23:18.040 --> 23:18.680]  All right, boys.
[23:19.360 --> 23:20.140]  You got there, didn't you?
[23:20.240 --> 23:22.400]  Guys, whenever you're ready, full group send.
[23:23.040 --> 23:24.680]  Did that work, Eric, what I was trying to do?
[23:24.840 --> 23:26.880]  Oh, yeah, I just jumped on top of the...
[23:27.460 --> 23:27.780]  Ball.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.780]  Yeah, jumped on top of the ball and just kind of rode it over.
[23:29.780 --> 23:34.020]  I went so far, so that way we didn't hit the next checkpoint yet.
[23:34.200 --> 23:36.380]  So, I just want to make sure that you guys can do your full group send.
[23:36.400 --> 23:36.680]  I'm ready.
[23:37.400 --> 23:38.300]  Whenever you guys are ready.
[23:38.980 --> 23:40.180]  Well, we need the plank on it.
[23:40.240 --> 23:41.760]  Yeah, somebody come help me get the plank.
[23:42.060 --> 23:43.480]  Oh, my God.
[23:43.480 --> 23:44.800]  Oh, my God, dog launch.
[23:45.480 --> 23:46.520]  That was a good dog launch.
[23:46.600 --> 23:47.740]  That was a good dog launch.
[23:47.800 --> 23:50.440]  All right, put this plank across the blocks.
[23:51.040 --> 23:51.740]  You guys got it?
[23:51.920 --> 23:53.380]  I think this is going to work.
[23:53.580 --> 23:54.960]  The top of the... okay.
[23:55.420 --> 23:56.180]  Top of the sticks.
[23:56.820 --> 23:57.020]  Okay.
[23:57.820 --> 23:58.840]  I think it's going to work.
[24:02.140 --> 24:02.800]  I'm trying.
[24:04.120 --> 24:05.880]  We'll need someone on top to pull it.
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.640]  I'm going to... I'm working on being somebody on top.
[24:12.840 --> 24:13.840]  What, just did like...
[24:14.900 --> 24:15.300]  Yeah.
[24:18.340 --> 24:19.900]  I was on top, then I fell.
[24:20.380 --> 24:20.860]  Oh, my God.
[24:21.280 --> 24:21.880]  Sandwiched in the middle.
[24:21.900 --> 24:24.020]  Can someone grab... Nick, do you have it at least?
[24:24.260 --> 24:24.600]  I'm trying.
[24:25.380 --> 24:26.080]  You guys got it?
[24:26.660 --> 24:27.320]  Oh, that's it, yeah.
[24:28.220 --> 24:31.440]  Why did you let go, Gavin?
[24:31.620 --> 24:31.940]  Why did you let go, Gavin?
[24:31.960 --> 24:32.440]  I'm lifting up.
[24:33.140 --> 24:35.680]  Okay, I'm pushing up on this side so it's grabbable.
[24:37.680 --> 24:39.560]  Can one of the uppers grab something?
[24:39.740 --> 24:41.020]  Oh, my God, we have no uppers.
[24:41.040 --> 24:42.260]  There's no uppers.
[24:43.080 --> 24:44.560]  We're only downers.
[24:44.820 --> 24:45.380]  Oh, man.
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.680]  I'm truly an uppers guy, but I'm already over here.
[24:49.200 --> 24:49.680]  Pull it up.
[24:49.760 --> 24:50.820]  Come on, come on, come on.
[24:50.880 --> 24:51.400]  Pull it up.
[24:52.220 --> 24:52.620]  Try it.
[24:52.880 --> 24:54.500]  Someone pull it.
[24:54.580 --> 24:55.140]  Hold on, hold on.
[24:55.720 --> 24:56.220]  Oh, shit.
[24:56.220 --> 24:57.280]  No balls, oh, shit.
[24:59.320 --> 25:00.140]  Uppers or downers?
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.300]  Nailed it.
[25:02.580 --> 25:02.960]  Fuck.
[25:03.460 --> 25:03.740]  Shit.
[25:03.880 --> 25:04.900]  All right, it's perfect.
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.020]  Someone pull it up.
[25:06.580 --> 25:07.520]  All right, somebody pull it up.
[25:07.740 --> 25:08.860]  Why is there no uppers ever?
[25:09.620 --> 25:10.900]  I don't know.
[25:11.180 --> 25:11.460]  Ow.
[25:13.020 --> 25:13.580]  Ow.
[25:15.720 --> 25:16.640]  My back.
[25:18.840 --> 25:19.940]  You're killing me.
[25:20.260 --> 25:21.480]  There's no uppers.
[25:21.580 --> 25:22.620]  I'm up now.
[25:23.280 --> 25:23.640]  Grab it.
[25:23.880 --> 25:23.960]  Nick's up.
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.240]  I don't...
[25:25.240 --> 25:26.920]  I'm close to being up.
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.140]  You have to go back.
[25:28.380 --> 25:28.880]  What about now?
[25:29.120 --> 25:29.360]  There you go.
[25:29.440 --> 25:30.320]  What about now?
[25:30.640 --> 25:30.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:30.880 --> 25:31.280]  Grab it.
[25:32.320 --> 25:32.960]  Grab it.
[25:33.160 --> 25:34.760]  Geoff, were you just snapping my spine?
[25:35.000 --> 25:35.700]  Oh, my God.
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.460]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[25:37.500 --> 25:38.140]  I'm just trying to help.
[25:38.420 --> 25:38.800]  All right, thanks.
[25:39.520 --> 25:39.880]  Uppers.
[25:40.160 --> 25:40.340]  Geoff.
[25:41.080 --> 25:41.320]  Geoff.
[25:41.460 --> 25:42.440]  Yeah, I'm Geoff.
[25:42.460 --> 25:43.140]  Oh, we almost got it.
[25:43.680 --> 25:44.540]  Yeah, we're good.
[25:45.420 --> 25:47.400]  All right, one of us needs to let go so we can reposition.
[25:50.780 --> 25:51.140]  Oops.
[25:51.720 --> 25:52.460]  Oh, my God.
[25:52.680 --> 25:52.760]  I died.
[25:52.760 --> 25:55.140]  All right, so this is the thing that I didn't think about until now.
[25:55.500 --> 25:56.300]  Yeah, this is great.
[25:56.420 --> 25:57.060]  This is cool.
[25:57.860 --> 25:58.860]  I died dying.
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.260]  It's going to flip.
[26:03.560 --> 26:04.340]  It's going to flip.
[26:04.660 --> 26:05.120]  It's going to flip.
[26:05.480 --> 26:06.000]  Oh, no.
[26:06.300 --> 26:06.980]  Oh, no.
[26:07.680 --> 26:09.280]  You guys need to get on the back.
[26:10.000 --> 26:10.500]  Help me.
[26:10.600 --> 26:11.100]  Help me.
[26:11.140 --> 26:11.960]  Grab that end, Gavin.
[26:12.080 --> 26:12.900]  Grab it before the bullets.
[26:13.080 --> 26:13.300]  Grab it.
[26:13.600 --> 26:13.800]  Grab it.
[26:13.960 --> 26:14.480]  Oh, no.
[26:15.380 --> 26:15.960]  Oh, no.
[26:19.000 --> 26:19.720]  Oh, no.
[26:20.020 --> 26:20.380]  Oh, no.
[26:20.600 --> 26:20.700]  Oh, no.
[26:21.740 --> 26:22.460]  Oh, no.
[26:22.460 --> 26:23.040]  Nick, help!
[26:24.900 --> 26:26.180]  It's so precarious.
[26:27.260 --> 26:27.360]  Nick!
[26:27.440 --> 26:27.800]  Nick!
[26:28.060 --> 26:29.540]  What do you want me to do, man?
[26:29.640 --> 26:29.700]  I'm on the roof.
[26:29.700 --> 26:30.140]  I got you.
[26:30.740 --> 26:31.440]  Nick, pull!
[26:32.460 --> 26:32.900]  Eve!
[26:33.060 --> 26:34.360]  I'm being torn asunder.
[26:38.560 --> 26:39.460]  Eric, help!
[26:39.880 --> 26:40.680]  No, no, you got it.
[26:42.180 --> 26:44.780]  Oh, my God.
[26:45.320 --> 26:46.640]  I'm tackling in the muck.
[26:47.340 --> 26:48.500]  I'm in the muck.
[26:49.440 --> 26:50.700]  Let go of my brain.
[26:53.840 --> 26:55.160]  Okay, let's go.
[26:56.080 --> 26:56.960]  Oh, can I stay?
[26:57.100 --> 26:57.640]  Keep swinging me.
[26:57.740 --> 26:58.640]  I'm going to lunge.
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.520]  I wonder if I stay holding on to the ball if I'll be spun up top.
[27:01.620 --> 27:02.460]  You're in the love.
[27:02.520 --> 27:03.620]  I can't even see you.
[27:05.020 --> 27:06.360]  Let's work together and swing.
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.240]  Yeah, work together.
[27:08.720 --> 27:09.640]  Get him, Drew!
[27:09.740 --> 27:10.420]  Adjusting the weight.
[27:13.040 --> 27:14.440]  Whose head do I need to pull?
[27:15.920 --> 27:16.280]  Back.
[27:17.900 --> 27:18.380]  Forward.
[27:19.660 --> 27:21.180]  Where did he come from?
[27:21.460 --> 27:22.440]  I thought you were still alive.
[27:22.460 --> 27:23.940]  I thought you were at the bottom.
[27:24.180 --> 27:25.060]  I got cooked in there.
[27:25.500 --> 27:26.640]  What are you going to do to help?
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.820]  All right, I'm going to go for a personal launch.
[27:32.400 --> 27:33.780]  What happened to the group launch?
[27:34.840 --> 27:36.300]  Well, the plank fell off.
[27:37.080 --> 27:37.460]  Go get it.
[27:37.520 --> 27:39.380]  I think a couple of people abandoned the launch plan.
[27:39.520 --> 27:41.380]  I mean, the plank's still there.
[27:42.200 --> 27:43.340]  I don't think it was going to work.
[27:44.100 --> 27:44.880]  Nope, plank's gone.
[27:46.200 --> 27:47.440]  Nick finally let go of it.
[27:47.440 --> 27:47.840]  Yeah.
[27:51.780 --> 27:55.180]  All right, we're just going to elephant ball to the end.
[27:55.440 --> 27:56.380]  I'm ready to elephant.
[27:56.880 --> 27:57.080]  Yeah.
[27:59.440 --> 27:59.840]  Yeah.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.420]  Bye, guys.
[28:03.720 --> 28:04.560]  All right, we're ready.
[28:04.900 --> 28:05.220]  We're ready.
[28:05.400 --> 28:06.840]  Let's all do this together on one ball.
[28:07.940 --> 28:08.620]  Oh, shit.
[28:09.000 --> 28:09.880]  Way to go, Nick!
[28:09.920 --> 28:10.720]  On one ball.
[28:11.940 --> 28:12.720]  That's not there yet.
[28:14.820 --> 28:15.140]  Uh-oh.
[28:15.400 --> 28:15.580]  Hurry.
[28:15.580 --> 28:18.680]  All right, everyone get in a big conga line.
[28:19.060 --> 28:22.460]  Jump on and ride the wave.
[28:23.040 --> 28:23.620]  There you go.
[28:25.580 --> 28:27.040]  My head got crushed.
[28:27.280 --> 28:27.860]  Nick made it.
[28:28.240 --> 28:29.160]  Nick went too far.
[28:33.360 --> 28:34.340]  You guys can do it.
[28:34.340 --> 28:35.260]  I believe in you guys.
[28:35.460 --> 28:36.880]  I think you can do it.
[28:38.600 --> 28:39.340]  You've done this far.
[28:39.920 --> 28:40.080]  What?
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.020]  Oh, Nick, were you close?
[28:41.040 --> 28:44.560]  I haven't walked far enough to activate the checkpoint.
[28:44.560 --> 28:46.220]  No, I thought you said Nick made it.
[28:46.340 --> 28:48.340]  Oh, no, Nick kept riding the ball all the way down.
[28:49.900 --> 28:51.640]  Yeah, all the way.
[28:52.340 --> 28:52.980]  Oh, here's the ball.
[28:53.220 --> 28:53.680]  Here comes the ball.
[28:53.940 --> 28:54.720]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[28:55.300 --> 28:56.660]  All right, hold on tight.
[28:59.800 --> 29:00.640]  I'm stomping it.
[29:03.140 --> 29:03.780]  And then...
[29:03.780 --> 29:04.880]  I'm in a real bad spot, guys.
[29:04.900 --> 29:06.940]  Yeah, what's the plan here, boys?
[29:06.940 --> 29:07.540]  I'm in a real bad spot.
[29:08.060 --> 29:08.860]  Has he stopped the ball?
[29:09.020 --> 29:09.460]  That's amazing.
[29:09.740 --> 29:10.560]  He's stopped the ball.
[29:10.600 --> 29:11.360]  He's being crushed.
[29:11.420 --> 29:12.060]  It looks pretty awful.
[29:13.020 --> 29:13.740]  All right, so can I...
[29:13.740 --> 29:16.100]  It's sprinkling me the wrong way.
[29:16.280 --> 29:17.760]  It looks pretty awful.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.640]  It's sprinkling me the wrong way.
[29:18.700 --> 29:19.760]  Gavin, it's now or never.
[29:20.140 --> 29:20.260]  Hold the ball!
[29:20.860 --> 29:21.820]  Hold the ball!
[29:23.040 --> 29:24.380]  I'm losing it.
[29:25.200 --> 29:26.220]  Goodbye, Andrew!
[29:26.720 --> 29:27.280]  Bye, Andrew.
[29:31.800 --> 29:35.000]  All right, I think I'm ready for the next pool.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.040]  Okay, you got this one, bud.
[29:38.120 --> 29:39.900]  I bet Eric's getting some great footage.
[29:40.380 --> 29:42.200]  It looks great from where I'm at.
[29:42.200 --> 29:44.480]  You related to the Pringles guy?
[29:45.460 --> 29:45.700]  Oh, me?
[29:46.540 --> 29:48.780]  Yeah. Yeah, he's my cousin. I died.
[29:49.900 --> 29:51.040]  Yeah, he got... yeah.
[29:52.120 --> 29:52.560]  Okay.
[29:54.640 --> 30:00.560]  You can do it. Come on, buddy. My brother-in-law is Mr. Peanut. All right, me and Gavin.
[30:01.240 --> 30:01.820]  Help me!
[30:01.880 --> 30:03.400]  Wait, we gotta help the dog. Grab my head!
[30:04.140 --> 30:10.280]  Eric, I'm gonna dangle my little legs for dog. Okay. Grab these. Grab the dog. Grab the legs.
[30:11.300 --> 30:14.620]  One sec. Grab his dog legs, little dog.
[30:16.020 --> 30:20.340]  Eric, you're gonna have to bridge the gap. I don't think I can. This footage is too good.
[30:20.880 --> 30:25.040]  You're gonna have to... Well, I can't because if the footage is so good, I don't think I can do it.
[30:25.300 --> 30:28.120]  Yeah, but how about this? Oh, yeah. Other dog. Bridge the dog gap.
[30:28.720 --> 30:29.720]  Grab the other dog.
[30:30.680 --> 30:38.180]  Eric just became a nature photographer. Yeah, this is really good footage. Other dog, grab me. Geoff, hang a bit lower so the other dog can grab.
[30:38.640 --> 30:40.800]  That's it. Grab dog. Dog, grab dog.
[30:42.160 --> 30:45.740]  Dog, grab dog. I'm trying to grab you, but I'm grabbing you with the wrong hand.
[30:45.780 --> 30:47.440]  I got him! I got him! Eric, pull us up!
[30:47.840 --> 30:51.480]  All right, go. Okay, ready? One, two, three, pull!
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.280]  Nick! Come here!
[30:55.080 --> 30:55.520]  Nick!
[30:56.140 --> 30:57.020]  Single man!
[30:57.680 --> 31:00.000]  Eric's shagging. He's not pretending to...
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.080]  Eric! Yeah. Eric's doing doggy style on someone.
[31:05.020 --> 31:07.840]  He's not helping the dogs. He's... He's absolutely... You got it, guys!
[31:07.840 --> 31:12.160]  He's pretending to do the dogs. What's he doing? Help the dogs, don't shag him!
[31:12.940 --> 31:14.500]  Eric! There's no one there!
[31:14.920 --> 31:15.760]  Eric's shagging Nick!
[31:16.280 --> 31:18.320]  Eric, stop! Eric, you're a dog helper!
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.660]  You're being a dog herder!
[31:21.000 --> 31:23.180]  Get your cock out of no one and help us!
[31:23.500 --> 31:25.580]  You're being cruel to animals!
[31:25.860 --> 31:26.740]  Think of Tyson!
[31:27.080 --> 31:27.900]  I can't see anything!
[31:28.160 --> 31:29.380]  Guys, the footage is too good.
[31:29.800 --> 31:31.540]  The footage is too good. Where is he?
[31:31.640 --> 31:35.420]  The chief, he's the chief and he needs ailing.
[31:35.640 --> 31:36.540]  Where is Eric?
[31:36.540 --> 31:38.560]  Oh, he's back at it, baby!
[31:38.920 --> 31:40.960]  It looks like he's shagging my fist,
[31:41.060 --> 31:41.980]  based on the perspective.
[31:42.380 --> 31:44.100]  He's putting his cock in my hand.
[31:45.480 --> 31:47.440]  Well, fucking don't close your hand then.
[31:48.200 --> 31:48.460]  Okay.
[31:48.740 --> 31:48.960]  Hey!
[31:50.020 --> 31:50.380]  No!
[31:53.760 --> 31:54.280]  Fuck!
[31:55.860 --> 31:57.160]  Land around me!
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.120]  Alright, everybody whack Eric.
[32:01.160 --> 32:03.480]  What are you talking about? The footage was too good.
[32:03.520 --> 32:04.480]  I was being the cameraman.
[32:04.480 --> 32:05.700]  Come on, let's get him!
[32:06.940 --> 32:07.900]  Nick's shagging him in the mouth!
[32:09.260 --> 32:10.080]  Gang B style!
[32:10.640 --> 32:11.660]  Gang B style!
[32:12.220 --> 32:12.960]  Help his leg!
[32:14.220 --> 32:14.300]  No!
[32:15.520 --> 32:18.140]  This is what we do to traitors!
[32:19.300 --> 32:20.440]  We're pulling him down!
[32:20.780 --> 32:21.780]  You're in the duck pound!
[32:24.720 --> 32:25.820]  Oh my god!
[32:29.880 --> 32:32.720]  Okay, so it looks like all these
[32:33.160 --> 32:35.080]  all these blocks can be moved.
[32:36.320 --> 32:36.760]  Alright.
[32:37.920 --> 32:38.660]  Even this one?
[32:39.300 --> 32:39.820]  Can they?
[32:41.800 --> 32:43.180]  Oh shit, that's not the floor!
[32:45.800 --> 32:46.880]  Can they be moved?
[32:47.300 --> 32:47.880]  Maybe not.
[32:48.060 --> 32:49.740]  These top ones can be.
[32:50.480 --> 32:52.720]  There's like two little ones that look like they should.
[32:57.700 --> 32:59.100]  Good teamwork, good teamwork.
[32:59.100 --> 32:59.640]  Yep.
[33:03.730 --> 33:05.610]  I suppose we don't need this for that then, eh?
[33:06.450 --> 33:08.050]  So where would we use this?
[33:09.950 --> 33:10.990]  Let it rain.
[33:12.070 --> 33:13.230]  Respawn a hundred times.
[33:13.770 --> 33:15.670]  Damn. Cool, way to go man.
[33:15.890 --> 33:16.510]  I suck.
[33:19.070 --> 33:19.550]  So...
[33:19.550 --> 33:20.410]  What do we do with these blocks?
[33:20.670 --> 33:22.370]  Where are these supposed to go?
[33:26.990 --> 33:29.270]  Do we need to make some sort of tippage?
[33:34.070 --> 33:34.430]  Ohhhhhh.
[33:36.050 --> 33:36.410]  Maybe.
[33:37.270 --> 33:39.710]  Like a way to put this here and then now the stick will reach?
[33:40.730 --> 33:41.930]  Doesn't this look like
[33:42.330 --> 33:43.710]  this block should go there
[33:43.710 --> 33:45.330]  and this looks like that block should go there?
[33:45.610 --> 33:47.870]  Oh, you wanna like complete the puzzle?
[33:48.550 --> 33:49.830]  Yeah, that's just like what it looks like
[33:49.830 --> 33:50.970]  but I don't think that matters, right?
[33:51.830 --> 33:53.610]  I think the box is too big.
[33:54.310 --> 33:55.690]  A million ways to do it.
[33:55.730 --> 33:56.330]  Yeah, they're too big.
[33:56.730 --> 33:57.770]  No, I think probably just one.
[33:57.770 --> 33:59.910]  I think just one way, probably.
[34:02.370 --> 34:04.630]  I think all these have just had one solution.
[34:04.830 --> 34:07.230]  I think if you slot them in
[34:07.230 --> 34:08.050]  those spots,
[34:08.390 --> 34:09.750]  they turn into stairs.
[34:10.310 --> 34:11.530]  Or jump across.
[34:11.930 --> 34:13.610]  I like Andrew's thinking!
[34:14.510 --> 34:15.010]  Oh no.
[34:16.770 --> 34:17.510]  Shooting star press!
[34:18.430 --> 34:20.310]  Nick, Nick, shove the stick and see if it will reach.
[34:20.490 --> 34:20.730]  Alright.
[34:26.030 --> 34:27.070]  Nick, come on.
[34:27.150 --> 34:29.210]  Somebody grab this end, just so it doesn't fall.
[34:29.210 --> 34:30.250]  Oh, the back?
[34:32.030 --> 34:32.650]  What the?
[34:32.750 --> 34:35.690]  I think it might work if we put
[34:35.690 --> 34:36.490]  the block here.
[34:36.510 --> 34:38.590]  Alright, let's try this.
[34:39.410 --> 34:40.770]  What does the block do?
[34:41.390 --> 34:42.470]  It holds it up on this end.
[34:43.210 --> 34:44.150]  That one block reset.
[34:46.150 --> 34:46.530]  Oh no.
[34:47.530 --> 34:48.470]  Oh Christ, no!
[34:49.150 --> 34:50.270]  Both blocks reset.
[34:52.150 --> 34:53.050]  Who pushed the stick?
[34:53.190 --> 34:54.170]  They both go up there.
[34:54.730 --> 34:56.170]  Who pushed the stick?
[34:57.070 --> 34:58.830]  Who pushed the stick?
[34:59.930 --> 35:00.770]  Who pushed it?
[35:01.170 --> 35:02.610]  Who pushed the stick?
[35:03.850 --> 35:06.630]  Oh, Nick, that was close.
[35:06.750 --> 35:07.830]  Yeah, right? Not bad.
[35:09.090 --> 35:10.050]  What's your idea, Andrew?
[35:11.430 --> 35:12.030]  Let me get up.
[35:12.530 --> 35:13.050]  Didn't work.
[35:14.130 --> 35:14.850]  Here's a block.
[35:16.570 --> 35:18.530]  And then, if you just grab it and start
[35:18.530 --> 35:20.410]  hitting jump, you'll move it around.
[35:21.630 --> 35:22.090]  Here's a block.
[35:22.610 --> 35:22.930]  Here you go, Nick.
[35:23.690 --> 35:24.730]  Here you go, Nick.
[35:25.370 --> 35:26.270]  Pass me the stick!
[35:27.890 --> 35:29.150]  You want the stick?
[35:29.510 --> 35:30.170]  I want the stick!
[35:32.050 --> 35:32.930]  Oh, Geoff!
[35:35.010 --> 35:36.310]  Not perfectly level.
[35:41.230 --> 35:43.510]  I don't know if we can get you the stick, buddy.
[35:44.050 --> 35:44.430]  Damn.
[35:45.610 --> 35:46.150]  I think we can.
[35:47.730 --> 35:48.130]  Hahaha.
[35:51.790 --> 35:52.790]  Oh, flippin' hell.
[35:53.550 --> 35:53.890]  Andrew.
[35:54.890 --> 35:55.870]  God bless Flip.
[35:58.490 --> 35:58.890]  Alright.
[35:59.670 --> 36:00.590]  You're straddling me.
[36:00.850 --> 36:01.570]  You're straddling me.
[36:03.430 --> 36:04.930]  Is this helping, Andrew?
[36:05.070 --> 36:05.530]  Oh no!
[36:06.450 --> 36:08.530]  I don't think you guys are going to be able to get it to me.
[36:08.850 --> 36:09.770]  No, I don't think so.
[36:10.650 --> 36:11.710]  So what is planned?
[36:12.550 --> 36:14.710]  What if two people were down the back of the stick
[36:14.710 --> 36:16.410]  and we just slide the stick over the gap?
[36:17.310 --> 36:17.410]  Yeah.
[36:19.530 --> 36:20.830]  Everyone get on the back.
[36:21.590 --> 36:22.990]  So it doesn't go flying.
[36:24.810 --> 36:27.170]  You should probably try to position it to this.
[36:27.350 --> 36:29.950]  And then put it on top of a block or something.
[36:30.270 --> 36:31.190]  You're grabbing me?
[36:33.870 --> 36:36.270]  Try this cubular block down there.
[36:37.370 --> 36:39.190]  And that could be our...
[36:40.070 --> 36:41.830]  Hey, this looks like the podcast table.
[36:42.750 --> 36:43.610]  Jesus Christ.
[36:45.030 --> 36:46.210]  Who's at the head of the table?
[36:47.410 --> 36:48.630]  Alright, now slide it.
[36:52.850 --> 36:54.210]  That's alright. It's okay.
[36:54.650 --> 36:55.650]  And then back on the block.
[36:55.670 --> 36:59.050]  You know what we could do? We could just drop this big-ass block on the back.
[36:59.070 --> 36:59.550]  I'm going to let go.
[37:01.570 --> 37:01.910]  Jesus.
[37:03.170 --> 37:04.710]  Well, we're going to have to get that block again.
[37:05.090 --> 37:05.650]  Oh, it's still there.
[37:07.090 --> 37:09.390]  Did you get stretched Matrix style?
[37:09.670 --> 37:10.590]  Oh, you still have the block?
[37:11.830 --> 37:13.370]  I snapped my neck on it.
[37:13.370 --> 37:15.490]  I came to help you and you let go.
[37:16.450 --> 37:18.990]  Yeah, I can't believe you did that, Andrew.
[37:19.790 --> 37:21.350]  That was really funny though.
[37:21.890 --> 37:24.450]  He ran to help and I'm just like, okay, you carry it.
[37:24.470 --> 37:25.910]  And I let go and I pulled it down.
[37:26.310 --> 37:26.710]  Oh.
[37:27.550 --> 37:28.630]  We could just climb on this wall.
[37:29.570 --> 37:29.970]  Yeah.
[37:30.670 --> 37:31.770]  That's a great idea.
[37:31.950 --> 37:32.730]  Put the cube on it.
[37:35.910 --> 37:37.210]  Chuck the jube.
[37:37.330 --> 37:39.490]  Alright, hold on.
[37:39.570 --> 37:39.990]  There it is.
[37:39.990 --> 37:41.510]  Did you call it the jube?
[37:43.310 --> 37:44.410]  The jube.
[37:44.590 --> 37:45.270]  The jube.
[37:45.630 --> 37:47.370]  So what's the plan here?
[37:47.730 --> 37:49.670]  So the plan is this, right?
[37:50.010 --> 37:51.990]  And then this.
[37:52.810 --> 37:53.090]  Okay.
[37:53.270 --> 37:54.610]  And then this.
[37:55.590 --> 37:59.050]  Yeah, they know the plan.
[37:59.150 --> 37:59.810]  Look at that.
[38:00.990 --> 38:01.590]  Balls.
[38:01.850 --> 38:02.230]  Balls.
[38:04.190 --> 38:04.990]  Dog jump!
[38:05.290 --> 38:06.370]  We made it!
[38:06.370 --> 38:07.890]  What a grab!
[38:08.250 --> 38:09.470]  What a dog grab!
[38:11.430 --> 38:12.390]  450 splash.
[38:14.230 --> 38:14.710]  Oh!
[38:15.850 --> 38:16.750]  You bumped my head.
[38:17.390 --> 38:19.470]  Oh, this looks like a send.
[38:19.770 --> 38:21.830]  Hey, I'm with you.
[38:21.970 --> 38:23.350]  I'm with you right now. Stay there.
[38:25.790 --> 38:26.610]  Body splash!
[38:27.550 --> 38:28.310]  I tell you what.
[38:28.470 --> 38:30.250]  It needs to be a four block send.
[38:30.910 --> 38:32.370]  Everyone grabbing a square.
[38:33.050 --> 38:34.030]  Dog stand on the end.
[38:35.890 --> 38:36.250]  Okay.
[38:37.350 --> 38:37.710]  Wait.
[38:38.390 --> 38:38.750]  What?
[38:39.530 --> 38:41.350]  Eric falling on the back is too light.
[38:41.830 --> 38:43.010]  What are we launching?
[38:43.210 --> 38:45.270]  Because right now, there's like a...
[38:46.810 --> 38:49.850]  If everybody stands on the back, it'll probably lift the person up front.
[38:49.950 --> 38:50.470]  Yeah, it's boring.
[38:50.650 --> 38:52.990]  Move this, and I'm gonna shoot you into the sky.
[38:53.470 --> 38:54.830]  Yeah, so dog get on the end.
[38:55.550 --> 38:56.610]  The front end or the back end?
[38:56.610 --> 38:58.010]  The front end. The send end.
[38:59.170 --> 39:00.650]  I mean, either one could be a send end.
[39:02.130 --> 39:03.910]  Well, not where we land though, I don't think.
[39:03.910 --> 39:05.150]  Oh, I see.
[39:06.130 --> 39:08.310]  Alright, brown dog, and then everyone else huddle.
[39:08.570 --> 39:08.750]  Huddle.
[39:10.070 --> 39:11.370]  Everyone grab on.
[39:11.450 --> 39:14.170]  Okay, everyone grab and hold on.
[39:14.710 --> 39:15.910]  The weight of four men.
[39:16.230 --> 39:17.150]  Okay, let's go over the edge.
[39:18.770 --> 39:19.890]  Keep holding!
[39:20.170 --> 39:21.250]  Keep holding! Hold!
[39:22.750 --> 39:23.390]  Oh, shit.
[39:24.450 --> 39:25.490]  He did it!
[39:25.550 --> 39:25.890]  It worked!
[39:26.570 --> 39:27.890]  That was perfect.
[39:28.950 --> 39:30.490]  That was awesome!
[39:31.750 --> 39:32.550]  Holy shit!
[39:32.750 --> 39:35.190]  I don't appear to be able to go anywhere from here,
[39:35.250 --> 39:36.730]  but that was very cool.
[39:38.650 --> 39:39.590]  That was so cool!
[39:39.590 --> 39:41.530]  Yeah, there's really no point for you being up there.
[39:41.690 --> 39:43.970]  I'm not really sure what to do now,
[39:44.150 --> 39:45.890]  but man, was it cool to get up there.
[39:47.830 --> 39:49.130]  You can't jump across?
[39:49.430 --> 39:50.450]  Oh, no, that's far.
[39:50.530 --> 39:51.770]  No, it's way too far.
[39:52.170 --> 39:55.850]  What if we put the long bridge piece on this end,
[39:57.010 --> 39:58.690]  and I don't know if we're shooting it up to you,
[39:58.710 --> 39:59.930]  or if we're just standing on the back,
[39:59.930 --> 40:01.530]  but either way, we're getting it up to you.
[40:02.090 --> 40:04.210]  Yeah, I don't know where to go from here.
[40:05.830 --> 40:08.370]  There's stuff on both sides.
[40:08.750 --> 40:10.430]  Do you think it's this way?
[40:11.790 --> 40:13.570]  To the orange fulcrum?
[40:13.990 --> 40:14.890]  To the...
[40:15.690 --> 40:16.930]  West? East?
[40:18.510 --> 40:18.890]  Oh!
[40:19.670 --> 40:21.050]  Geoff, you got the plank!
[40:21.150 --> 40:22.190]  I got the plank!
[40:23.830 --> 40:25.730]  That was serendipitous.
[40:25.970 --> 40:26.890]  How did that happen?
[40:27.330 --> 40:29.010]  I fell and landed on the thing,
[40:29.090 --> 40:29.930]  and it launched it up.
[40:30.250 --> 40:33.570]  In that case, let's give Geoff the box as well.
[40:33.710 --> 40:34.690]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:34.810 --> 40:35.750]  Put it down.
[40:36.030 --> 40:37.430]  Put it on that end.
[40:37.670 --> 40:38.770]  Oh, that's the send end, isn't it?
[40:39.730 --> 40:41.810]  Geoff, where'd you go?
[40:42.450 --> 40:43.110]  I'm on top.
[40:43.770 --> 40:46.550]  Although, I don't really know what I'll be doing with it.
[40:46.670 --> 40:48.590]  You don't know shit. It's fine. Don't worry about it.
[40:48.710 --> 40:49.430]  Geoff, catch!
[40:50.850 --> 40:51.530]  Oh, shit.
[40:51.890 --> 40:54.150]  We gotta do all four. It has to be the four men.
[40:54.150 --> 40:55.410]  It has to be the four men.
[40:55.550 --> 41:00.890]  I will say, it does look like you could get up on this tree, maybe, if you were a little higher.
[41:01.010 --> 41:01.770]  Although, I don't know what you'd do.
[41:01.770 --> 41:03.610]  Dog, grab! Dog, bark!
[41:04.690 --> 41:05.050]  Dog!
[41:07.510 --> 41:08.530]  Stupid ass dog.
[41:08.990 --> 41:09.990]  I'm trying to grab!
[41:10.290 --> 41:10.790]  Let's go!
[41:11.930 --> 41:12.490]  Hold on.
[41:12.670 --> 41:13.490]  Here we go, Geoff!
[41:15.970 --> 41:16.770]  It's off the ledge.
[41:17.730 --> 41:18.810]  We're off to the side there.
[41:21.170 --> 41:22.890]  I think maybe if we get up there,
[41:22.890 --> 41:24.130]  we can make a plank
[41:24.130 --> 41:25.470]  that's weighted down.
[41:25.770 --> 41:28.610]  I mean, you know,
[41:28.630 --> 41:29.970]  like a walk-the-plank type situation.
[41:30.110 --> 41:33.830]  I do think we're supposed to go over where, like, the fulcrum or whatever is, right?
[41:34.530 --> 41:37.010]  Like, not the across with all the swinging things,
[41:37.150 --> 41:38.750]  but, yeah, like that way where Gavin's facing.
[41:39.130 --> 41:39.330]  Yeah.
[41:40.330 --> 41:41.250]  The one with the two trees.
[41:41.670 --> 41:44.570]  How are you guys gonna get up here? I guess maybe you won't.
[41:44.630 --> 41:45.310]  Maybe it'll just be me.
[41:45.530 --> 41:48.930]  What if we get more people up there,
[41:48.990 --> 41:50.730]  and then we edge the plank
[41:51.190 --> 41:52.370]  out towards the edge,
[41:52.510 --> 41:54.870]  and then have people stand on the back to keep it rigid.
[41:55.490 --> 41:55.890]  100%.
[41:55.890 --> 41:58.330]  Yeah, that's what I thought we were already doing.
[41:58.350 --> 41:58.650]  I gotcha.
[42:00.070 --> 42:02.250]  We need more men.
[42:02.470 --> 42:04.510]  More men. Three men go.
[42:05.050 --> 42:05.730]  Where's the dog?
[42:07.370 --> 42:08.270]  Hold on tight, Gavin.
[42:08.810 --> 42:09.030]  Oh, no!
[42:10.450 --> 42:13.030]  Gotta be one more. Andrew, unfortunately...
[42:13.030 --> 42:13.670]  I'm here. I'm here.
[42:15.550 --> 42:16.490]  Andrew, preed it.
[42:17.090 --> 42:17.210]  Yep.
[42:17.210 --> 42:17.570]  Alright.
[42:18.230 --> 42:20.450]  Ready to grab me.
[42:22.530 --> 42:24.090]  Oh, I hit the tree!
[42:24.530 --> 42:25.490]  Alright, let's try again.
[42:26.010 --> 42:29.130]  You gotta be positioned at the right front edge.
[42:29.350 --> 42:29.890]  Let's go.
[42:30.890 --> 42:31.650]  Here we go.
[42:32.390 --> 42:33.150]  Oh, boy.
[42:33.390 --> 42:35.850]  Gotta clear the canopy.
[42:36.790 --> 42:37.350]  Wow.
[42:38.110 --> 42:40.850]  Alright, so...
[42:40.850 --> 42:42.310]  Come on over here.
[42:42.550 --> 42:45.150]  I think our best bet, I guess, is to
[42:45.150 --> 42:46.990]  put that box on the back of this
[42:46.990 --> 42:47.310]  and then
[42:48.750 --> 42:50.390]  plank this out, I guess? I don't know.
[42:50.490 --> 42:52.390]  But the box isn't gonna be heavy enough, is it?
[42:52.510 --> 42:54.870]  No, it'll probably take the box plus everybody else.
[42:54.990 --> 42:57.250]  I just don't know what else we're supposed to do
[42:57.250 --> 42:59.030]  from up here. I think we need one
[42:59.030 --> 43:01.270]  person. We need one more
[43:01.270 --> 43:02.990]  person up here, and then
[43:02.990 --> 43:05.230]  two hold the back, one runs
[43:05.230 --> 43:06.950]  across and goes. I agree.
[43:08.130 --> 43:08.530]  Alright.
[43:08.950 --> 43:10.410]  Oh, yeah. There we go.
[43:10.470 --> 43:13.070]  Alright, you guys grab the left.
[43:13.070 --> 43:14.590]  It's a single. I guess I'll go
[43:15.350 --> 43:17.130]  left farthest back and the right farthest
[43:17.130 --> 43:17.430]  back.
[43:19.230 --> 43:20.530]  You wanna here? Like in the middle?
[43:21.010 --> 43:22.990]  You have to grab
[43:22.990 --> 43:24.030]  like far back.
[43:24.710 --> 43:27.110]  Because we're gonna walk it off, and I'm
[43:27.110 --> 43:29.090]  gonna try to run and jump it.
[43:29.330 --> 43:30.750]  You're stuck? Yeah, like that.
[43:30.930 --> 43:31.950]  There you go. Where are you?
[43:33.230 --> 43:35.330]  Careful, careful, careful.
[43:35.630 --> 43:36.510]  It's getting wonky.
[43:36.890 --> 43:39.210]  Alright, grab it. There you go.
[43:39.590 --> 43:41.170]  Let me come back to where you were. Grab it both hands,
[43:41.170 --> 43:43.170]  Geoff. Okay. There you go.
[43:44.610 --> 43:44.990]  We're
[43:44.990 --> 43:46.310]  drifting that way a little bit.
[43:48.330 --> 43:49.290]  I'm not grabbing it.
[43:49.670 --> 43:50.370]  Geoff's on the ledge.
[43:50.590 --> 43:52.430]  I'm hanging off the edge, but that's fine.
[43:53.070 --> 43:54.290]  We're trying to get you up.
[43:54.530 --> 43:55.650]  We got you up.
[43:56.030 --> 43:58.790]  We need to angle it a bit more.
[43:58.810 --> 44:00.790]  Is that jumpable now, do you think, if it's like half out?
[44:01.110 --> 44:02.310]  Woah, woah, woah, Nick!
[44:02.490 --> 44:05.010]  It's okay, it's okay. That's great!
[44:05.130 --> 44:06.810]  Someone make the jump! Hang on.
[44:07.090 --> 44:08.090]  Alright, hold on. Hold on.
[44:08.090 --> 44:09.990]  I'm holding it down. We're holding it down.
[44:10.010 --> 44:11.090]  Look at him go!
[44:13.010 --> 44:13.430]  Yes!
[44:14.190 --> 44:15.250]  I'm just short!
[44:16.570 --> 44:17.310]  So close.
[44:17.850 --> 44:19.770]  We just need to go forward a little bit.
[44:20.330 --> 44:21.590]  Andrew, let's go for the send.
[44:22.270 --> 44:23.390]  I'm on the other side.
[44:23.790 --> 44:24.210]  What?
[44:25.430 --> 44:26.570]  You're on the other side of what?
[44:27.110 --> 44:28.470]  I went back. Why?
[44:29.370 --> 44:31.050]  I went back to across.
[44:32.530 --> 44:32.930]  On my way.
[44:33.630 --> 44:34.930]  Oh, fuck.
[44:34.930 --> 44:36.330]  It's not going to be enough.
[44:38.190 --> 44:39.470]  It's not going to be enough!
[44:39.590 --> 44:40.350]  I'm here.
[44:40.710 --> 44:41.430]  Alright, we need the dog.
[44:42.690 --> 44:45.950]  Quickly, before Nick and Geoff lose concentration.
[44:46.670 --> 44:47.710]  It's hard.
[44:48.650 --> 44:49.790]  Dog jump!
[44:51.010 --> 44:52.190]  Jump in!
[44:52.470 --> 44:53.270]  Eric send!
[44:54.470 --> 44:55.770]  Woah, what the fuck?
[44:56.610 --> 44:58.330]  I got wonky.
[44:59.370 --> 45:00.330]  Alright, dog jump!
[45:00.850 --> 45:01.530]  Jump in!
[45:01.530 --> 45:02.650]  Oh, I'm watching.
[45:02.950 --> 45:03.670]  I got the angle.
[45:04.630 --> 45:05.450]  This is great!
[45:06.550 --> 45:07.350]  Come on!
[45:08.790 --> 45:10.730]  It feels like I'm hitting something.
[45:10.890 --> 45:11.370]  Alright, one more time.
[45:11.470 --> 45:12.530]  We got this.
[45:12.890 --> 45:13.590]  Dog jump!
[45:16.150 --> 45:16.550]  Nice!
[45:20.210 --> 45:21.930]  So, I'm going to start going.
[45:22.050 --> 45:23.650]  You guys just have to go out a little bit further.
[45:23.890 --> 45:24.550]  That's all it is.
[45:25.110 --> 45:26.170]  We already did.
[45:26.630 --> 45:28.370]  Look at this!
[45:28.370 --> 45:30.230]  Big jump!
[45:30.810 --> 45:31.890]  He's done it!
[45:33.770 --> 45:34.390]  Hang on.
[45:35.550 --> 45:37.150]  There we go.
[45:38.310 --> 45:39.450]  Pull myself up.
[45:39.530 --> 45:39.930]  Yeah!
[45:42.190 --> 45:43.950]  Alright boys, come across.
[45:44.530 --> 45:45.570]  That was teamwork.
[45:46.910 --> 45:48.990]  Nick, you made it!
[45:49.050 --> 45:49.550]  I made it!
[45:50.210 --> 45:50.890]  What?
[45:52.350 --> 45:53.850]  Nick, did you make that?
[45:54.190 --> 45:56.230]  I ran as the plank fell and jumped.
[45:56.230 --> 45:57.310]  That's awesome!
[45:57.870 --> 45:59.590]  Did the plank start up there?
[46:00.130 --> 46:00.390]  Yes.
[46:02.030 --> 46:02.710]  That's funny.
[46:03.690 --> 46:04.990]  You guys didn't know that?
[46:05.130 --> 46:05.350]  No.
[46:08.650 --> 46:09.310]  That's funny.
[46:09.710 --> 46:11.190]  Because we bounced it up there.
[46:11.530 --> 46:12.250]  Yeah, we bounced it back.
[46:14.310 --> 46:16.090]  We returned it from whence it came.
[46:17.350 --> 46:18.390]  What's going on over here?
[46:20.090 --> 46:20.710]  What's that?
[46:21.290 --> 46:22.590]  Well, the spinning shit.
[46:22.750 --> 46:24.270]  It feels like we don't have to go that way.
[46:24.930 --> 46:26.130]  Maybe we'll come to it.
[46:26.390 --> 46:28.170]  Yeah, I think we get to it eventually, don't we?
[46:28.490 --> 46:29.810]  Or do we bypass it?
[46:30.030 --> 46:31.870]  Do you think we skipped it?
[46:31.990 --> 46:32.750]  I assume.
[46:33.790 --> 46:35.550]  Alright, I'm going to move this around.
[46:35.950 --> 46:36.690]  Put the thing in it.
[46:36.910 --> 46:37.910]  We might have skipped it.
[46:38.390 --> 46:42.290]  We skipped all the hard part.
[46:43.790 --> 46:46.370]  That's maybe not great for a video,
[46:46.790 --> 46:47.330]  but that's awesome.
[46:48.270 --> 46:49.370]  Did you not see the jump?
[46:50.250 --> 46:51.110]  It was awesome!
[46:51.510 --> 46:52.870]  Alright, Eric, get in the platform.
[46:53.030 --> 46:55.410]  In the platform.
[46:55.810 --> 46:57.650]  Alright, and now get the block when we come down.
[47:01.870 --> 47:02.790]  Get that block.
[47:02.930 --> 47:03.710]  Nope, nope, nope.
[47:04.910 --> 47:05.710]  It's got to be further.
[47:06.950 --> 47:09.110]  There has to be a run and a jump to it, I think.
[47:11.630 --> 47:13.210]  Okay, I am ready.
[47:17.130 --> 47:18.050]  Here we go.
[47:18.050 --> 47:19.710]  I think we need to do it the opposite.
[47:19.890 --> 47:21.350]  More people need to be on Eric's thing,
[47:21.450 --> 47:23.790]  and then I will send up to that block.
[47:25.210 --> 47:26.370]  Why would that?
[47:28.170 --> 47:31.110]  Now, dog, drag the platform around.
[47:32.150 --> 47:32.630]  Got it.
[47:34.250 --> 47:35.570]  That's it, that's it.
[47:37.630 --> 47:39.410]  Wait, what?
[47:39.730 --> 47:40.610]  What the fuck?
[47:40.850 --> 47:42.550]  Oh, that's cool.
[47:43.570 --> 47:44.150]  So smart.
[47:45.130 --> 47:46.090]  Alright, and now,
[47:46.590 --> 47:47.810]  what do we do with this?
[47:50.950 --> 47:51.630]  No idea.
[47:53.390 --> 47:54.250]  But Andrew has
[47:54.250 --> 47:55.350]  not let go of this platform.
[47:56.650 --> 47:58.210]  Well, now there could be a block in it.
[47:58.710 --> 48:00.150]  Okay, do you think that helps?
[48:00.690 --> 48:02.150]  Well, maybe now it's weighed
[48:02.150 --> 48:04.430]  down enough that we can all use the other end.
[48:04.510 --> 48:06.050]  I think maybe what we do,
[48:06.170 --> 48:08.170]  what we can do is we can bring it up here
[48:08.170 --> 48:09.890]  instead of right here and jump off of it.
[48:09.910 --> 48:11.390]  You mean the other end that we can't reach now?
[48:11.390 --> 48:12.290]  We can get to that maybe.
[48:13.410 --> 48:15.550]  We'll drag it around. No, you can drag the platform
[48:15.550 --> 48:16.470]  and it'll come back around.
[48:16.730 --> 48:18.270]  Go to the top.
[48:25.160 --> 48:25.520]  Damn.
[48:26.540 --> 48:27.880]  That's even close.
[48:30.140 --> 48:31.700]  I think we can take it up here,
[48:32.920 --> 48:34.740]  put it right here, stand on top of it
[48:34.740 --> 48:35.680]  and make that jump maybe.
[48:36.120 --> 48:37.760]  Oh, for sure. Okay, it's a wide gap.
[48:38.300 --> 48:40.560]  But now, I think Gavin's a little...
[48:40.560 --> 48:41.900]  Yeah, I think we gotta move that thing.
[48:50.200 --> 48:51.260]  There you go.
[48:52.860 --> 48:53.540]  Okay.
[48:55.580 --> 48:56.560]  Come on.
[48:56.680 --> 48:58.180]  Oh boy. Okay.
[48:59.140 --> 49:00.280]  Try to stabilize it.
[49:02.140 --> 49:02.940]  Nope.
[49:04.160 --> 49:06.540]  Here we go. Come on.
[49:09.080 --> 49:10.400]  Climb up!
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.760]  Bastard man!
[49:14.440 --> 49:16.680]  Why won't he go up?
[49:18.440 --> 49:19.020]  There we go.
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.140]  No!
[49:21.380 --> 49:23.240]  I'm gonna go insane.
[49:23.560 --> 49:26.180]  It looked like on my screen that the dog pulled you down.
[49:26.260 --> 49:26.940]  But I don't think he did.
[49:27.480 --> 49:28.840]  I definitely did not.
[49:29.440 --> 49:29.980]  Yay!
[49:32.440 --> 49:33.140]  Good thinking, Geoff.
[49:33.540 --> 49:35.160]  That was awesome.
[49:35.740 --> 49:37.360]  Now, what do we do?
[49:39.860 --> 49:40.440]  Well...
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.240]  I went over here earlier
[49:42.240 --> 49:44.460]  and there was a whole
[49:44.460 --> 49:45.960]  downstairs part here.
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.220]  Well, what if you...
[49:47.220 --> 49:50.140]  What if you...
[49:50.140 --> 49:51.980]  Yeah, what if instead of
[49:51.980 --> 49:54.020]  stopping at this block that I did last time
[49:54.020 --> 49:55.320]  I just keep going up to the next one?
[49:55.740 --> 49:57.960]  I don't know that it has...
[49:59.100 --> 50:00.280]  Oh, yeah, I could keep going.
[50:00.440 --> 50:02.020]  Alright, so you gotta put that on the ground
[50:02.020 --> 50:04.020]  because I think these two blocks go in this thing
[50:04.020 --> 50:05.340]  to help it weigh down so we can go.
[50:06.080 --> 50:07.040]  Yeah, do wait.
[50:08.060 --> 50:08.820]  Or just have...
[50:09.380 --> 50:10.960]  Or just have a bunch of people hold it.
[50:11.360 --> 50:12.660]  Alright, do wait.
[50:12.660 --> 50:13.500]  Pulling it down.
[50:13.740 --> 50:15.500]  Here we go.
[50:16.480 --> 50:17.360]  Pull it down.
[50:18.020 --> 50:20.400]  Gavin, I think you can let go.
[50:22.800 --> 50:23.800]  Oh, nice job, Andrew.
[50:25.380 --> 50:26.600]  Well, now I can't reach it.
[50:27.440 --> 50:27.900]  Oh, really?
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.880]  What if we lift it up
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.180]  while the blocks are on it?
[50:33.120 --> 50:33.600]  If you can.
[50:34.220 --> 50:34.540]  Trying.
[50:35.420 --> 50:37.380]  Alright, so I'll grab the end.
[50:37.840 --> 50:38.720]  Let us know when you're there.
[50:40.860 --> 50:41.260]  Okay.
[50:41.480 --> 50:42.020]  Got it?
[50:42.220 --> 50:43.720]  Let's walk it all the way.
[50:44.980 --> 50:45.820]  No, I'm in.
[50:46.980 --> 50:47.900]  No, I'm not on it.
[50:48.300 --> 50:50.000]  Why did you say that you were on it?
[50:50.220 --> 50:52.040]  I said okay when I fell off
[50:52.040 --> 50:53.680]  and I realized that sounded like I was ready.
[50:56.020 --> 50:56.820]  Jesus Christ.
[50:57.240 --> 50:58.160]  Okay, I'm ready.
[50:58.480 --> 50:59.400]  Oh, guys, I'm not ready.
[50:59.840 --> 51:01.560]  Alright, hang on.
[51:02.180 --> 51:02.640]  Down a bit.
[51:02.720 --> 51:03.240]  Down a bit.
[51:03.240 --> 51:04.020]  Trying to grab it.
[51:04.200 --> 51:05.700]  There you go.
[51:07.600 --> 51:08.480]  And then...
[51:08.480 --> 51:11.380]  Do we want to attach a dog to me for style or what?
[51:11.620 --> 51:12.500]  Yeah, you got it.
[51:13.980 --> 51:15.580]  This one dog is being crushed.
[51:16.240 --> 51:16.540]  Oh, shit.
[51:17.160 --> 51:17.940]  I'm limboing.
[51:18.880 --> 51:19.660]  Did it work out?
[51:19.680 --> 51:21.500]  What is this going to do for us?
[51:21.880 --> 51:23.520]  We're going to get all the way across. Watch.
[51:24.860 --> 51:25.020]  Oh.
[51:25.360 --> 51:26.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:29.060 --> 51:30.060]  There you go.
[51:30.060 --> 51:31.620]  Keep going.
[51:31.780 --> 51:32.620]  Keep going.
[51:32.860 --> 51:33.720]  There you go.
[51:35.420 --> 51:36.400]  Keep going.
[51:36.480 --> 51:38.360]  Go, go, go.
[51:39.300 --> 51:39.720]  Jump.
[51:41.620 --> 51:42.180]  Yeah.
[51:44.360 --> 51:44.920]  Woo.
[51:46.100 --> 51:46.660]  So...
[51:47.220 --> 51:49.380]  We're just going back to do the part we missed.
[51:49.800 --> 51:50.340]  Is that backwards?
[51:51.060 --> 51:51.640]  I think so.
[51:51.820 --> 51:53.100]  I think this is forward.
[51:55.280 --> 51:56.720]  We're going up to the temple.
[51:56.720 --> 51:57.420]  Yeah, we are.
[51:57.920 --> 52:00.280]  What's this area behind us with all the...
[52:00.280 --> 52:01.060]  We skipped it.
[52:02.720 --> 52:04.340]  I knew we skipped something.
[52:04.560 --> 52:06.040]  Nick didn't say that he needed help.
[52:06.580 --> 52:08.220]  Yeah, we skipped all that.
[52:08.480 --> 52:09.700]  We can try and get to it.
[52:09.920 --> 52:11.780]  No, I think we just have to replay this level later.
[52:11.960 --> 52:13.440]  This just means we have to replay it.
[52:14.340 --> 52:15.740]  Did I skip this last time?
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.080]  I mean, it is a little confusing that they run parallel.
[52:22.100 --> 52:24.480]  I feel like I've never seen that bit with the pendulum.
[52:25.900 --> 52:27.020]  I want to go there.
[52:27.560 --> 52:29.140]  Well, too bad, dickhead.
[52:29.420 --> 52:29.520]  Okay.
[52:30.200 --> 52:31.200]  Wait, why am I the dickhead?
[52:31.400 --> 52:34.220]  You should have thought of that before we didn't go that way.
[52:34.220 --> 52:36.760]  You should have thought of that before we came up with an awesome way to get around it.
[52:36.760 --> 52:39.580]  Yeah, I mean, what we did ended up being fucking rad.
[52:40.060 --> 52:40.760]  It was pretty cool.
[52:41.080 --> 52:41.840]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[52:42.240 --> 52:43.340]  So maybe get off your high horse.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.400]  God.
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.020]  Yeah.
[52:48.660 --> 52:51.060]  Okay, there's a stick over here.
[52:51.060 --> 52:55.540]  This stick has to get lifted to like poke one side down.
[52:55.740 --> 52:56.260]  Yeah, I think so.
[52:56.420 --> 52:57.220]  That makes sense.
[52:59.160 --> 53:00.380]  Let's get it.
[53:01.760 --> 53:02.200]  Ow.
[53:05.300 --> 53:07.500]  Can you get kind of like underneath it?
[53:07.640 --> 53:12.180]  Instead of like on top and pulling it down, like poke under it so the other side lowers?
[53:12.540 --> 53:13.420]  Let's put it here.
[53:14.840 --> 53:15.580]  And go up.
[53:16.600 --> 53:17.460]  Oh, yeah.
[53:18.620 --> 53:19.380]  Let's take a look.
[53:21.780 --> 53:23.160]  Nick with a stick.
[53:23.280 --> 53:24.460]  There you go. That's it.
[53:24.660 --> 53:25.000]  Wow.
[53:26.200 --> 53:27.520]  Oh, it goes all the way over.
[53:27.900 --> 53:29.600]  Oh my god, it doesn't stop.
[53:29.900 --> 53:31.680]  Oh, boys.
[53:32.040 --> 53:32.960]  Oh, boys.
[53:35.620 --> 53:36.580]  Oh, guys.
[53:37.100 --> 53:37.720]  Alright, send me.
[53:38.120 --> 53:39.440]  Oh, boys.
[53:40.260 --> 53:41.600]  You gotta swing with it, Gavin.
[53:42.260 --> 53:42.700]  Okay.
[53:45.380 --> 53:46.220]  This is great.
[53:46.220 --> 53:46.900]  Huh?
[53:48.260 --> 53:51.340]  Oh, I'm realizing what the sticks are for now.
[53:51.460 --> 53:52.660]  Oh, to stop it?
[53:53.000 --> 53:53.120]  Yeah.
[53:53.480 --> 53:53.980]  The catchment zone.
[53:55.640 --> 53:56.520]  I'm swinging.
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.220]  Oh!
[54:00.440 --> 54:03.060]  The lower I get, the better I'll swing.
[54:03.560 --> 54:04.080]  Oh, god.
[54:04.660 --> 54:05.260]  Oh, it stopped.
[54:05.800 --> 54:06.680]  Not dead yet.
[54:07.140 --> 54:09.640]  Oh, this is much worse. What happened?
[54:10.200 --> 54:11.460]  It's so bad over here.
[54:11.840 --> 54:13.080]  Alright, going for the swing.
[54:13.080 --> 54:14.240]  I'm swinging.
[54:16.300 --> 54:16.960]  Oh, no!
[54:20.660 --> 54:22.960]  I think I'm gonna get squished.
[54:26.540 --> 54:28.080]  Why would you do that?
[54:28.320 --> 54:30.460]  I was just aiming for anything.
[54:30.980 --> 54:32.400]  Let me go!
[54:32.880 --> 54:33.820]  Oh, that was good.
[54:34.720 --> 54:36.040]  Oh, did that help? I do good?
[54:36.720 --> 54:39.780]  I feel like the lower we hang, the more pendulous we are.
[54:40.720 --> 54:42.960]  Well, that is true of most low-hanging things.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.140]  Oh, there you go. Andrew, you got it.
[54:45.380 --> 54:47.100]  I'm shafted.
[54:47.600 --> 54:48.820]  Oh, this is going well.
[54:48.820 --> 54:49.600]  This is going great.
[54:50.760 --> 54:52.260]  Come on, Andrew, come on.
[54:52.780 --> 54:53.700]  We're in, I think.
[54:56.260 --> 54:57.440]  We're getting too far to one side.
[54:57.500 --> 54:57.820]  There we go.
[54:59.540 --> 55:00.140]  Come on.
[55:00.840 --> 55:02.380]  Yeah, I don't...
[55:02.380 --> 55:04.440]  I don't think this is quite it.
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.580]  No, definitely not.
[55:06.580 --> 55:07.920]  Oh, well...
[55:09.160 --> 55:09.700]  Hang on.
[55:10.380 --> 55:12.240]  He loves that.
[55:12.940 --> 55:14.000]  No, he does not.
[55:15.160 --> 55:16.240]  Yeah, I don't think we go...
[55:16.240 --> 55:16.860]  I don't think it goes here.
[55:16.960 --> 55:19.460]  I think it just needs to go...
[55:20.300 --> 55:21.520]  down back here.
[55:25.280 --> 55:26.840]  Look how much we're swinging.
[55:28.200 --> 55:29.120]  Oh, look at that.
[55:29.180 --> 55:29.940]  That looks great.
[55:31.300 --> 55:32.060]  Alright, fellas.
[55:32.840 --> 55:34.540]  Alright, we're making progress now, Gav.
[55:34.540 --> 55:35.960]  Yep. Alright, Geoff.
[55:36.060 --> 55:37.600]  You can probably let go now.
[55:39.460 --> 55:40.260]  You motherfuckers.
[55:41.460 --> 55:42.220]  You guys can let go.
[55:42.420 --> 55:42.960]  We got it.
[55:43.780 --> 55:44.900]  Andrew, you got it.
[55:45.500 --> 55:46.220]  Go for it, buddy.
[55:47.860 --> 55:48.900]  Oh, no!
[55:49.780 --> 55:51.460]  No, we had to anchor it.
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.300]  Derek said let go, and I was confused
[55:54.300 --> 55:55.220]  as to why he wanted that.
[55:56.020 --> 55:56.820]  Wanted him to go.
[55:57.720 --> 55:58.600]  To where? Hell?
[55:59.100 --> 55:59.380]  Yeah.
[55:59.380 --> 55:59.980]  Okay.
[56:00.740 --> 56:01.300]  Aw!
[56:02.640 --> 56:04.740]  I spent about a minute, like,
[56:04.860 --> 56:05.840]  getting it up to speed.
[56:06.600 --> 56:07.700]  Don't do that.
[56:09.720 --> 56:10.280]  Oh!
[56:10.680 --> 56:11.060]  Hahaha!
[56:12.120 --> 56:12.680]  Hahaha!
[56:14.840 --> 56:15.660]  Not on purpose.
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.280]  I know, it's okay.
[56:17.740 --> 56:20.440]  I had such a brutal view of that.
[56:20.480 --> 56:21.300]  It looked awful.
[56:21.760 --> 56:24.620]  I was like, yes, there's hope,
[56:24.700 --> 56:26.040]  and then I was ripped away.
[56:26.900 --> 56:28.240]  Do your Derek thing again,
[56:28.300 --> 56:29.240]  and I'll stay on it.
[56:29.840 --> 56:32.040]  Oh, balls. God damn it.
[56:42.430 --> 56:43.450]  Oh, flipping hell.
[56:44.690 --> 56:45.770]  Andrew, is there another stick up there
[56:45.770 --> 56:46.650]  that you can knock over? Yep.
[56:47.550 --> 56:49.590]  Placed it. Oh, you already placed it?
[56:50.070 --> 56:51.390]  Yep. Hey, Gavin?
[56:51.950 --> 56:53.030]  Yep? You wanna grab?
[56:57.670 --> 56:58.490]  Alright, I'm low.
[56:59.070 --> 57:00.550]  Sorry. Are you able to?
[57:00.550 --> 57:02.230]  Let me...
[57:02.230 --> 57:04.790]  do some magic. I think we just have to drag it
[57:05.650 --> 57:06.550]  one way here.
[57:07.010 --> 57:08.510]  I think it just needs to get... yeah, like that.
[57:08.630 --> 57:10.330]  There we go. We're getting it now, Geoff.
[57:10.330 --> 57:11.970]  I think that's all it needs to be. There we are.
[57:11.990 --> 57:13.910]  Because now it'll block this one side.
[57:14.770 --> 57:15.770]  Yeah, so someone can... oh.
[57:16.310 --> 57:18.470]  We're swinging, fellas! Oh, Nick,
[57:18.530 --> 57:20.650]  we're doing great. We got this!
[57:21.110 --> 57:22.370]  Hey, Nick, guess what? What's up?
[57:22.950 --> 57:24.290]  We're swingers. Oh!
[57:25.110 --> 57:25.970]  Nick loves that.
[57:26.410 --> 57:28.610]  This is how you find out. Andrew can jump on the...
[57:28.610 --> 57:30.650]  Oh, wrong side. Oh, Andrew!
[57:31.150 --> 57:31.930]  Oh, Andrew!
[57:32.670 --> 57:34.670]  I have a pineapple tattoo update, actually.
[57:34.770 --> 57:36.610]  Instead of jumping on the top, Andrew jumped
[57:36.610 --> 57:37.650]  on the bottom. Yeah.
[57:40.730 --> 57:42.650]  I felt really good about it. Oh, yeah?
[57:43.050 --> 57:44.290]  And how do you feel about it now?
[57:44.450 --> 57:46.030]  That thing is hitting me in the back.
[57:46.650 --> 57:48.610]  So this... I think this stick...
[57:49.270 --> 57:50.710]  Gavin, will you grab the other side of this?
[57:51.210 --> 57:52.550]  Yeah. I mean, it was in
[57:52.550 --> 57:54.610]  position. It was, but I
[57:54.610 --> 57:56.390]  think it's gonna keep bonking them.
[57:56.390 --> 57:58.150]  They need to go all the way,
[57:58.370 --> 58:00.550]  and then we need to walk it in after they go.
[58:00.730 --> 58:00.970]  Yep.
[58:03.170 --> 58:03.890]  Here we come!
[58:04.470 --> 58:06.130]  Can we hold it up so that we...
[58:06.130 --> 58:07.670]  Oh, you guys are
[58:08.230 --> 58:10.090]  going the wrong way. We are?
[58:10.470 --> 58:11.410]  It's not gonna go
[58:12.110 --> 58:14.190]  a full 360. This isn't
[58:14.190 --> 58:16.290]  hitting you. We...
[58:16.830 --> 58:17.230]  Okay.
[58:19.290 --> 58:20.310]  You were gonna be
[58:20.310 --> 58:22.390]  really indignant about that, but then you figured out that I was
[58:22.390 --> 58:24.470]  right. Is that right? No, I was just gonna say, we can't
[58:24.470 --> 58:26.070]  really choose what we're doing here.
[58:26.290 --> 58:28.470]  And we are getting higher each time,
[58:28.610 --> 58:29.750]  except for the thing that we're hitting.
[58:30.130 --> 58:31.810]  Yeah, we need Andrew to stand on top of it.
[58:33.610 --> 58:34.510]  Eric! Hang on.
[58:35.170 --> 58:35.950]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[58:37.090 --> 58:38.230]  If... Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[58:38.350 --> 58:39.650]  If you keep it over there,
[58:40.770 --> 58:42.910]  and they're swinging back and forth...
[58:42.910 --> 58:44.390]  Yeah, you need to jump on the top from where
[58:44.390 --> 58:46.490]  Andrew was. Alright, here we go. We got it now, Geoff.
[58:46.490 --> 58:47.470]  Here we go. Ready?
[58:48.630 --> 58:50.070]  Jam that shithole. Ah!
[58:50.290 --> 58:51.150]  Why is it there?
[58:53.510 --> 58:54.230]  Yeah, he...
[58:54.230 --> 58:55.470]  Like, I mean,
[58:55.510 --> 58:57.450]  everything we said makes perfect sense,
[58:57.510 --> 58:59.450]  and it's just like, he's not paying attention, so it's fine.
[58:59.570 --> 59:01.470]  We're gonna flip up, and then you can slide it right under us!
[59:01.710 --> 59:02.610]  We don't slide it under!
[59:02.690 --> 59:04.490]  Alright, yeah, go ahead and flip up.
[59:04.770 --> 59:06.950]  You need to come lower on the other side.
[59:07.290 --> 59:08.930]  Gavin, let them flip up.
[59:09.130 --> 59:11.590]  They got big ideas. Let them flip up.
[59:12.190 --> 59:13.190]  Don't say they!
[59:13.510 --> 59:15.270]  Don't say they! All I'm doing is
[59:15.270 --> 59:17.330]  sitting here fucking swinging. That's all
[59:17.330 --> 59:19.110]  I'm doing. My job is to swing. I don't have any
[59:19.110 --> 59:21.330]  big ideas. I don't have any small ideas.
[59:21.770 --> 59:23.110]  I just swing.
[59:23.270 --> 59:25.190]  Now, Nick, what do you want us
[59:25.190 --> 59:25.590]  to do?
[59:26.770 --> 59:29.150]  On the next one, we're gonna be able to actually go
[59:29.150 --> 59:30.510]  higher than where you are,
[59:30.890 --> 59:33.210]  and then you can slide it under us, and then we'll be up.
[59:33.770 --> 59:34.070]  Absolutely.
[59:35.030 --> 59:35.750]  Alright, what are we hitting?
[59:37.390 --> 59:39.170]  There's another goddamn plank up there.
[59:39.710 --> 59:41.210]  Gavin, what I explained makes sense, right?
[59:41.270 --> 59:41.830]  I'm not crazy?
[59:42.710 --> 59:45.130]  Okay, so what do you want us to do?
[59:45.150 --> 59:46.230]  So you're gonna make it the full way, Nick?
[59:46.230 --> 59:47.850]  Nope, there's a plank in the way.
[59:53.740 --> 59:55.160]  It's been there so long.
[59:55.840 --> 59:57.140]  It's been there so long.
[59:58.060 --> 59:59.460]  All I see is dog
[59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.060]  and plank.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.360]  All Nick and I see is dog
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.280]  and brown. You'll have to forgive us for doing
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.120]  you know. Nope, no forgiveness
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.400]  given. Alright.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.600]  And we're done.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.860]  It's stuck. Oh no.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.980]  That's a shame.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.380]  I wonder how that could have been fixed.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.120]  It's stuck.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.320]  Guys.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.720]  Oh, it's stuck. Oh no. Geoff, what do you think?
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:26.900]  That's
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.100]  really stuck.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.260]  Looks like he stuck it.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.920]  How'd he do that?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:32.940]  I don't know.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.880]  I tried to get it across so at least
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.900]  we could just get that. So at least their swinging
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.820]  could pay off since it was such a
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.920]  lost cause. I tried just to help them
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.680]  at the end, and then this thing
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.940]  kicked left, and now it's just stuck.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.740]  And now this dog is humping me
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.600]  big style.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.820]  Oh, how does it feel to be humped?
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.700]  It feels like I'm at your
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.780]  house with your dog.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:57.980]  How do you think I learned?
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.680]  Is the stick on top just blocking it?
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.920]  Is that where it starts? Yes.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.600]  But we need it
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.160]  we need it there, I
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.640]  think, so that way it can't go backwards
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.300]  and forwards.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.380]  What we need to do is just trap either end of it
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.440]  so it's ramping up. Yeah, and then just have
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.100]  one person stand on the end to
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.340]  bounce away. I think we might be fucked.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.340]  I think this
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.140]  wood is just stuck.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.480]  We gotta find another way around this. Can we jump
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.880]  onto the
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.460]  moving piece? Does this
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.680]  move? Is this moving at all?
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.340]  That is not moving.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.320]  It is.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.420]  Here, let me get down to you, Eric.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.760]  It's stuck, right?
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:39.500]  Yeah.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.320]  I think
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.440]  Gavin and I got it.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.180]  Just keep...
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.680]  Everyone pile on. Everyone weigh it down.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.460]  That's it.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.340]  Get it?
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.540]  We need more weight.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.460]  We need more bodies.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.800]  Bodies.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.980]  Bodies for what? Bodies are here.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.640]  We're trying to dislodge. Alright, while you do that
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  I'm going to try to do this.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.000]  Good job.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.940]  I have a great shot of this. This is great.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.460]  Alright, next swing.
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:09.440]  Oh shit, dog!
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.560]  How's it going up there, Geoff?
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.780]  I think we gotta get to the other corner.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.020]  Nick, there you go!
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:16.960]  This is the end.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.600]  It's moving. There's something moving.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.420]  It's moving.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.600]  Everyone grab it.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.220]  Jam on jump and just keep hitting buttons.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.500]  Go crazy mode.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:28.940]  It's moving!
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:30.880]  We got it.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.920]  There it goes!
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920]  There we go.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.560]  Alright, so we moved
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.040]  the trap plank at the top?
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.320]  Yeah, it's gone.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.360]  I think it needs to go across
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.240]  What?
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.120]  Oh, Geoff jumped on it.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.520]  It's swinging.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.060]  I think it needs
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.480]  to go across
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.220]  Like where I was trying to put it
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.400]  I think it's going to give us enough so we can get across.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:11.520]  I'm sniffing your butt, Nick.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.620]  Dude, you were in there.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.780]  It either needs to go across there or here.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.640]  But like, if it goes across here, you have to be
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.340]  so fast and boy
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.040]  is it hard.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.880]  I need a shower.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.160]  It looks like I'm doing something dirty
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.600]  with my left paw.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.640]  Wouldn't it be better
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.520]  to get the top stick
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.520]  off first so it can freely spin?
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.240]  Yeah, we can do that.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.800]  Otherwise they keep slamming the backstop.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.560]  Yeah, do you know how to get up?
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.700]  I don't know how to get up there.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.420]  If they keep swinging, right?
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.220]  I'll grab it.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.740]  Ow! Oh, Andrew, that's the same thing
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.840]  that happened to me and it got all sideways.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.080]  What?
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.080]  Oh, Geoff hit the platform. That's what that was.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.540]  I was like, I've hit some resistance.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.820]  Yeah, yeah, jam it under there.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:03.880]  There you go.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.040]  That might be it.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.400]  Yeah, yeah, keep standing there.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.080]  We're back here, Gavin. You're good.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.860]  Locked it in.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.160]  Geoff, don't.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.100]  Can you just run up this plank
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.100]  and jump off the other end? Maybe.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.920]  Is that far enough? Maybe.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.400]  Did it work?
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.000]  Did it work?
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.300]  I just watched him do it.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.860]  We didn't get a save.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.500]  There it is!
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.600]  Now we can go, we can tilt, and we're good.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.840]  So we were all right in the end.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.960]  We were all right in the end, guys.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:37.860]  I mean, I was right.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.680]  The thing we ended up doing was my idea, right?
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:42.100]  Yeah, you're the foreman.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.020]  You're the genius of the group.
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.720]  You're the architect.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.300]  Yeah, that's what they call you.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.960]  That's why you're dressed like an architect.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.560]  I'm Indiana Chef.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.500]  I mean, clearly we've got to do some rolling.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.740]  That was pretty funny.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.540]  Does this lift?
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.680]  Oh, I see.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.220]  So it needs weight to lift it.
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.400]  I'll go with the other dog.
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320]  We're dogging it up.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.560]  Hey, look, look, look.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.100]  Can you put the block there?
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.900]  Yeah, look, put the block there.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.600]  Yeah, do that.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:16.700]  There's a block there.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.340]  On the trapdoor.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.660]  Are we talking about the architect?
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:22.100]  He's architecting it.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:22.880]  Are we talking about the architect?
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.220]  Geoff, I'd expect more from my swinging buddy.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.600]  I'm fucking supporting you!
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.940]  It felt sarcastic.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.760]  Everybody listen to the architect.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.340]  I wish I could re-nickname you,
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.220]  but you're Mecha Nick for the year.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.140]  Which I've decided.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.400]  Are you talking about the architect?
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.080]  I think it's supposed to be mechanic,
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.280]  but I like Mecha Nick better.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.760]  You know Mecha Nick, the architect?
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.460]  Like a Mecha Koopa?
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.040]  Yeah.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.100]  What are we doing in here, Gavin?
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.600]  We just did a circle.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.620]  Geoff, we beat it.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.540]  Way to go, guys!
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.740]  What an incredible game
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.880]  of human fall flat.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.480]  It's gizmo.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.560]  It's gassy goo.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.020]  It's baby Pepsi.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.940]  It's Lil Ricky B.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.200]  And it's the mechanic, aka the architect.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.220]  Guys, what a game.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.280]  What a way to play.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.360]  Everyone climb on top of Nick, the architect.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.560]  See if you can build the way out of here.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.380]  It's not human fall flat
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.640]  as much as it is
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.100]  dog jump round.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.260]  I think maybe we should all be dogs
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.200]  when we play this again.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.220]  The dogs have been pretty good.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.500]  You mean the dog pounds?
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.080]  Dog pounds for the boys!
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.240]  Alright guys, check out the podcast.
