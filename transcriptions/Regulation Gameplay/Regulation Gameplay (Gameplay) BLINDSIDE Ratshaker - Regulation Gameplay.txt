[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  My nose is extra open today.
[00:02.240 --> 00:03.860]  Blindside! Hey guys, what's up?
[00:03.980 --> 00:08.000]  Welcome to a Blindside that I have not used all year.
[00:08.200 --> 00:09.820]  So excited to be here.
[00:10.280 --> 00:13.600]  Guys, we are playing a brand new game.
[00:14.100 --> 00:16.820]  Hopefully everyone's recording. I'm already recording the game, Nick.
[00:16.840 --> 00:18.260]  Don't worry about it.
[00:18.460 --> 00:22.460]  Guys, this is a brand new game.
[00:23.180 --> 00:24.260]  Is it called the podcast?
[00:24.840 --> 00:27.780]  This is called Rat Shaker. Welcome to Rat Shaker!
[00:27.780 --> 00:29.140]  Oh, Rat Shaker.
[00:29.600 --> 00:30.980]  Guys, welcome to Rat Shaker.
[00:31.180 --> 00:33.560]  We have to record the podcast. I'm going out of town.
[00:34.140 --> 00:35.600]  Wait, we have to record too, don't we?
[00:35.660 --> 00:37.060]  Guys, are you watching my screen?
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.620]  Oh, I like this.
[00:40.320 --> 00:41.240]  Shake that rat!
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.840]  What are you doing to the rat?
[00:44.000 --> 00:44.680]  I'm shaking him.
[00:45.840 --> 00:47.240]  Welcome to Rat Shaker.
[00:47.880 --> 00:50.120]  Well now, hold on. So this is a Blindside?
[00:50.480 --> 00:50.740]  Yeah.
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.460]  Does the rat have AIDS? What's the AIDS thing?
[00:53.600 --> 00:56.100]  No, there's no AIDS here. This is just simply Rat Shaker.
[00:56.100 --> 00:57.800]  What are you trying to get out of the rat?
[00:58.780 --> 00:59.220]  Information.
[01:00.260 --> 01:01.740]  The bar's filling.
[01:02.080 --> 01:02.320]  Yeah.
[01:04.540 --> 01:05.420]  That's the rat!
[01:06.420 --> 01:06.920]  What do you mean?
[01:07.440 --> 01:09.860]  Gavin doesn't understand a thing about Rat Shaker.
[01:10.300 --> 01:11.320]  I got a lot of questions about it.
[01:11.540 --> 01:12.740]  Gavin, this is Rat Shaker.
[01:13.520 --> 01:14.800]  Why are we doing this?
[01:15.120 --> 01:15.640]  What do you mean?
[01:16.660 --> 01:17.900]  It's a Blindside, Nick.
[01:19.100 --> 01:20.540]  Andrew, are you in on the Blindside?
[01:21.220 --> 01:22.300]  No one was in on the Blindside.
[01:22.300 --> 01:23.980]  I'm just going along with it. I'm just having fun.
[01:24.400 --> 01:25.920]  You seem very okay with this.
[01:26.080 --> 01:28.120]  Blindside happens. You can't fight it. You gotta go with the tide.
[01:28.580 --> 01:30.280]  I shook the rat 100 times.
[01:30.480 --> 01:31.460]  I just got an achievement.
[01:32.200 --> 01:34.740]  This kind of reminds me of a game called Soda Drinker Pro.
[01:34.980 --> 01:36.120]  Where you just drink sodas.
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.680]  It's pretty similar, I think.
[01:38.860 --> 01:40.700]  Gavin, how are you feeling about Rat Shaker so far?
[01:42.380 --> 01:44.100]  Yeah, I can't wait to see. Oh, his eyes.
[01:44.460 --> 01:44.820]  Horrible.
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.560]  Why did you stop shaking him?
[01:46.720 --> 01:47.920]  Oh, okay. Keep shaking the rat?
[01:47.920 --> 01:48.140]  Yeah!
[01:50.360 --> 01:52.320]  That's not Rat Holder, Eric.
[01:54.020 --> 01:54.540]  Oh!
[01:55.440 --> 01:55.960]  Jake!
[01:58.300 --> 01:59.340]  Don't stop!
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.860]  Eric, shake that rat!
[02:01.320 --> 02:02.360]  I'm shaking the rat?
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.340]  Whoa! Did you see that?
[02:05.360 --> 02:07.500]  Yeah, some dust just flew in the frame.
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.660]  The house built in the background?
[02:10.280 --> 02:12.100]  You're building a house with a rat?
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.580]  I don't know. I guess so.
[02:13.900 --> 02:15.920]  Was the house in the rat?
[02:15.920 --> 02:17.080]  Did you shake it out of him?
[02:18.160 --> 02:20.000]  It's like a Terrence Malik movie.
[02:21.920 --> 02:23.220]  Keep shaking the rat!
[02:23.780 --> 02:25.140]  Keep shaking the rat!
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.720]  I've never played Rat Shaker.
[02:27.860 --> 02:30.680]  I just downloaded it. It was $3 on Steam.
[02:30.780 --> 02:31.500]  Oh, this is good.
[02:32.220 --> 02:33.680]  Yeah, I'm shaking this rat.
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.720]  Geoff, how are you feeling about it?
[02:35.240 --> 02:37.520]  I mean, you definitely seem to be shaking it.
[02:37.940 --> 02:38.960]  I am shaking it.
[02:39.120 --> 02:41.640]  I'm pressing all the other buttons. There's only one button that works.
[02:41.720 --> 02:44.400]  And it is the left mouse button and shaking the rat.
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.180]  How much money do you think the person that made this has made off this?
[02:48.600 --> 02:51.340]  Uh, they've sold over a thousand copies so far.
[02:51.580 --> 02:53.220]  They lost money on it.
[02:53.520 --> 02:54.020]  Stop! Stop!
[02:56.640 --> 02:59.140]  Whoa, you built some sort of statue thing?
[02:59.380 --> 03:00.200]  Feel it.
[03:00.580 --> 03:02.760]  Feel it. Oh, you're making a windmill.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.300]  Taste it.
[03:04.300 --> 03:05.060]  Is that a demon?
[03:05.360 --> 03:06.920]  Why does it say taste it?
[03:07.340 --> 03:07.800]  What?
[03:09.300 --> 03:12.380]  And then the rat says, it doesn't matter how much you shake me,
[03:12.380 --> 03:14.180]  you can't undo what's been done.
[03:14.180 --> 03:16.060]  Oh, we're gonna see about that.
[03:16.700 --> 03:17.640]  Shake to undo?
[03:18.380 --> 03:18.940]  Shake that rat!
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.180]  This should be a Switch game.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.760]  I just thought you'd have to physically shake this fucking
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.300]  Wiimote type thing.
[03:26.620 --> 03:29.400]  Are you just holding down the mouse button or are you actually moving your arm?
[03:29.460 --> 03:30.340]  Oh, no, I'm actually...
[03:30.340 --> 03:32.040]  Here's what happens when you just hold it.
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.700]  But here I have to shake it.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.180]  You really have to work it.
[03:36.940 --> 03:39.600]  Do you think it's better with small shakes like this?
[03:39.960 --> 03:41.340]  Or do you think it's better with big shakes?
[03:41.340 --> 03:43.320]  Why don't you ask the rat what he thinks?
[03:43.820 --> 03:46.440]  Do you think this is how they stress test mice at raising?
[03:56.320 --> 03:57.760]  There's nothing to move.
[03:57.880 --> 03:58.420]  This is it.
[03:58.880 --> 04:00.320]  I pressed every other button.
[04:00.620 --> 04:02.120]  Listen to the demon.
[04:06.380 --> 04:06.860]  Squeeze!
[04:06.860 --> 04:07.460]  Did he squeeze?
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.200]  He's choking!
[04:11.820 --> 04:13.420]  That is fucking disturbing, dude.
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.160]  The eye is coming out.
[04:15.340 --> 04:17.560]  I hate this so much.
[04:17.740 --> 04:20.660]  It's like a high-def joke cartoon.
[04:21.260 --> 04:22.640]  Yeah, it is!
[04:23.140 --> 04:24.100]  Holy shit!
[04:25.340 --> 04:26.240]  Oh, stop it!
[04:26.460 --> 04:27.420]  I hate it!
[04:28.440 --> 04:29.440]  He'll die!
[04:33.020 --> 04:35.640]  This is the worst thing we've ever filmed.
[04:36.860 --> 04:37.520]  I don't like it.
[04:37.520 --> 04:38.380]  I don't either.
[04:39.180 --> 04:41.200]  Stop, please stop.
[04:41.760 --> 04:45.260]  You broke him!
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.660]  What does that mean?
[04:46.820 --> 04:47.800]  What does it mean?
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.260]  Is this Nicodemus?
[04:50.980 --> 04:51.520]  What?
[04:51.900 --> 04:52.980]  You built a factory.
[04:54.740 --> 04:55.900]  That's true.
[04:56.180 --> 04:57.480]  Can you walk now?
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.500]  I'm hitting the buttons.
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.120]  Nope.
[05:01.860 --> 05:03.920]  He keeps screaming.
[05:05.160 --> 05:06.760]  The house built by sin.
[05:06.860 --> 05:08.060]  Jesus Christ.
[05:08.100 --> 05:08.620]  Good lord.
[05:09.040 --> 05:10.140]  What is this?
[05:11.940 --> 05:13.240]  Oh, you can move now.
[05:14.700 --> 05:16.900]  There's a lot more game here than I thought.
[05:17.280 --> 05:19.660]  Also, he seems to be talking and screaming simultaneously.
[05:19.660 --> 05:20.680]  Yeah, it's the best.
[05:21.560 --> 05:22.820]  They've even got lighting on him.
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.760]  I'm getting a migraine.
[05:25.840 --> 05:26.420]  Hang on.
[05:26.620 --> 05:28.140]  You are imagining how he feels.
[05:28.880 --> 05:30.580]  We have a bunch of languages we can do.
[05:30.660 --> 05:31.740]  I feel good about English.
[05:33.800 --> 05:35.000]  There's no inversion.
[05:35.200 --> 05:35.780]  We have subtitles.
[05:35.880 --> 05:36.480]  We have head bob.
[05:36.580 --> 05:37.520]  I think this is all fine.
[05:38.140 --> 05:40.720]  I think we're good.
[05:41.100 --> 05:43.080]  I just wanted to make sure.
[05:43.680 --> 05:45.740]  It seems really difficult to walk.
[05:47.380 --> 05:48.400]  There we go.
[05:49.460 --> 05:49.940]  Oh my god.
[05:49.940 --> 05:52.140]  Now is it naturally constantly pointing up?
[05:52.280 --> 05:52.540]  Yes.
[05:52.760 --> 05:54.080]  Yes, it is.
[05:54.760 --> 05:56.140]  This is what happens if I don't.
[05:59.780 --> 06:01.180]  We're almost at the house.
[06:01.880 --> 06:06.260]  I never thought I'd say that I miss content about AIDS.
[06:08.880 --> 06:11.040]  It just keeps pulling up.
[06:11.420 --> 06:12.900]  It won't let me stop.
[06:13.200 --> 06:13.880]  Oh, you know what?
[06:14.060 --> 06:15.920]  If I shake the rat, it won't.
[06:16.060 --> 06:18.460]  Oh, the rat is controlling it.
[06:19.480 --> 06:21.200]  Shake that fucking rat.
[06:21.560 --> 06:22.360]  Oh, we're almost at the house.
[06:23.700 --> 06:24.800]  Oh my god.
[06:25.040 --> 06:25.620]  Oh!
[06:28.400 --> 06:29.260]  What's inside?
[06:29.260 --> 06:31.980]  This is the treatment for Ratatouille 2.
[06:33.600 --> 06:34.900]  I must find it.
[06:34.940 --> 06:36.480]  It just keeps pulling me up.
[06:36.480 --> 06:36.960]  What?
[06:39.050 --> 06:39.380]  Shake!
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.240]  We're at the house.
[06:42.940 --> 06:44.520]  Is it like PT now?
[06:45.220 --> 06:46.040]  Oh shit.
[06:46.220 --> 06:46.820]  Walk backwards.
[06:48.600 --> 06:50.040]  It's called rat tea.
[06:51.540 --> 06:52.060]  Walk rat woods.
[06:54.560 --> 06:56.620]  Oh, he's immortal and you can't hurt him.
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.900]  I went backwards.
[07:04.780 --> 07:05.740]  Shake it.
[07:05.800 --> 07:07.160]  Oh, it's easy shakes.
[07:08.340 --> 07:09.940]  That bar is filling fast.
[07:10.220 --> 07:12.220]  Maybe you leveled up your bicep or something.
[07:12.500 --> 07:12.860]  Yeah.
[07:13.400 --> 07:15.960]  It keeps pulling me up and I don't know why.
[07:16.400 --> 07:17.340]  I think...
[07:17.340 --> 07:19.980]  Have you got like a controller plugged in that you'll sat on or something?
[07:20.220 --> 07:21.280]  What are you doing to it?
[07:22.420 --> 07:23.740]  Oh my god, you're right.
[07:23.740 --> 07:25.060]  I have a controller.
[07:26.280 --> 07:27.080]  You idiot.
[07:27.520 --> 07:28.700]  You dumb dumb.
[07:29.020 --> 07:30.560]  Eric blindsided himself.
[07:32.660 --> 07:33.400]  Oh man.
[07:33.640 --> 07:36.140]  Okay, so now I've shaken the rat, but what do I do?
[07:36.600 --> 07:37.020]  Kill it.
[07:37.220 --> 07:38.560]  I think you gotta go the other way, right?
[07:38.660 --> 07:40.760]  Because you went backwards. Can you go the other way?
[07:41.600 --> 07:43.320]  Are you making it suck you off?
[07:43.360 --> 07:44.760]  Oh, there we go.
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.120]  Oh, it is PT.
[07:48.120 --> 07:48.180]  It's PT.
[07:52.200 --> 07:52.860]  Find it.
[07:55.200 --> 07:59.680]  Oh, can you throw that rat in the fire?
[08:00.380 --> 08:01.520]  Alright, guys we're looking.
[08:06.760 --> 08:08.640]  Turn the TV on with the rat.
[08:11.360 --> 08:13.360]  Okay, so I'm getting the...
[08:13.360 --> 08:16.240]  So whenever that... I think if you shake, it powers it up.
[08:18.540 --> 08:19.800]  No, maybe not.
[08:19.820 --> 08:21.700]  Okay, never mind.
[08:24.120 --> 08:26.360]  You have to squeeze him.
[08:29.460 --> 08:31.380]  You have to squeeze him.
[08:31.820 --> 08:32.100]  I see.
[08:34.480 --> 08:35.440]  Rat shaker?
[08:38.840 --> 08:40.480]  Can I buy a rat shaker?
[08:41.220 --> 08:42.000]  It got spooky.
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.920]  You know what's crazy to think about?
[08:43.920 --> 08:44.800]  What's that?
[08:45.240 --> 08:47.220]  Somebody had this idea.
[08:47.960 --> 08:48.120]  Yeah.
[08:49.620 --> 08:50.700]  No bad ideas.
[08:51.360 --> 08:53.320]  Didn't say it was bad, just crazy.
[08:54.260 --> 08:55.600]  Yeah, anything can get made now.
[08:55.660 --> 08:58.340]  This would have taken millions of dollars at one point.
[08:58.500 --> 09:00.020]  Yeah, you would have had to pitch this
[09:00.020 --> 09:02.600]  to some sort of an angel investing company
[09:02.600 --> 09:04.080]  who didn't understand it
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.140]  and saw potential.
[09:06.860 --> 09:09.000]  It won't let me go through this door.
[09:09.180 --> 09:09.720]  I think it's locked.
[09:10.260 --> 09:12.340]  Is it a QR code that won't stop moving?
[09:12.680 --> 09:13.000]  Yeah.
[09:15.140 --> 09:16.060]  Somebody screenshot, quick.
[09:17.680 --> 09:19.580]  I don't like it when I can't see the rat, actually.
[09:19.640 --> 09:20.700]  Because I don't know what you're doing with it.
[09:22.280 --> 09:24.280]  Keep the rat in front of you at all times, please.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.540]  Is this the rat's family?
[09:26.720 --> 09:27.380]  Is this my home?
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.440]  I will say Smee loves this.
[09:29.540 --> 09:30.900]  He's all over my screen right now.
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.940]  Yeah, it's just the door.
[09:34.500 --> 09:34.800]  Okay.
[09:37.700 --> 09:38.400]  Oh, I don't like that.
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.700]  Is this someone home, but with rats?
[09:40.140 --> 09:40.540]  Yeah.
[09:55.140 --> 09:56.780]  Oh, some VHS tapes.
[09:58.880 --> 10:00.860]  So are we moving in or moving out?
[10:03.440 --> 10:05.580]  I'll be honest, I thought that was the rat, but it was Nick.
[10:05.580 --> 10:08.800]  Yeah, that happens.
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.060]  Oh, a lot of toilet paper.
[10:12.280 --> 10:14.020]  Damn, too much toilet paper.
[10:17.360 --> 10:20.360]  Also, people have octagonal butts here, apparently.
[10:21.080 --> 10:21.560]  How weird.
[10:23.660 --> 10:24.180]  What else?
[10:24.420 --> 10:25.360]  Oh, can you turn the sink on?
[10:28.300 --> 10:28.900]  Okay.
[10:29.780 --> 10:30.880]  What about the toilet?
[10:31.440 --> 10:32.240]  Rat shaker?
[10:33.780 --> 10:34.700]  Okay, let's...
[10:36.140 --> 10:37.600]  Is he going to overflow?
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.440]  Did I actually wake up today?
[10:40.980 --> 10:41.120]  Yeah.
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.440]  You're still sleeping, open your eyes.
[10:43.440 --> 10:44.660]  Did I lapse into your dream?
[10:44.900 --> 10:47.640]  You're 11 minutes into episode 29 of the regulation podcast right now.
[10:49.680 --> 10:50.480]  Let's see.
[10:50.740 --> 10:52.420]  Oh, here we go. Andrew, how about this?
[10:52.660 --> 10:54.980]  Oh, that's a big tub.
[10:56.100 --> 10:56.880]  I like that.
[10:58.580 --> 11:00.560]  Don't you wish it worked that way for you, Andrew?
[11:00.560 --> 11:02.640]  Where you hit a button and then it was instantly full?
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.240]  Yeah, unlike where I have to squeeze a rat and then it slowly fills.
[11:08.700 --> 11:09.100]  Oh.
[11:10.220 --> 11:11.580]  What was the other hand doing there?
[11:12.400 --> 11:13.120]  I think it tickled him.
[11:13.880 --> 11:14.980]  Whatever you wanted to do.
[11:15.620 --> 11:17.100]  A little rat tickle?
[11:17.420 --> 11:18.060]  Throw him in the fire.
[11:19.740 --> 11:21.500]  I tried, but I don't think I can.
[11:21.940 --> 11:22.620]  Cook him and eat him.
[11:22.840 --> 11:23.520]  Oh, there you go.
[11:25.240 --> 11:28.680]  Maybe that goes on the wall.
[11:28.680 --> 11:31.380]  Where the QR code is.
[11:31.520 --> 11:33.400]  Oh, it is.
[11:33.780 --> 11:34.340]  Geoff, you're right.
[11:35.160 --> 11:36.720]  We'll shake the rat about it.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.100]  Yep.
[11:38.660 --> 11:39.680]  Probably the next step.
[11:40.040 --> 11:42.360]  Oh, shit.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.500]  What the...
[11:44.500 --> 11:46.240]  What was this?
[11:48.100 --> 11:49.500]  Is this Slenderman shit?
[11:50.260 --> 11:50.840]  Whoa.
[11:52.240 --> 11:54.340]  Is there going to be a rat king?
[11:55.720 --> 11:56.600]  Don't. That's scary.
[11:58.920 --> 12:00.740]  Don't come near me. I have this rat.
[12:01.720 --> 12:04.080]  There's going to be a ratty boy on the other side of that door.
[12:04.340 --> 12:04.580]  No.
[12:09.040 --> 12:10.040]  Is there anything here?
[12:10.420 --> 12:13.320]  How did you find this?
[12:13.560 --> 12:14.700]  Were you looking for it?
[12:14.720 --> 12:15.740]  What do you mean? Rat shaker?
[12:16.380 --> 12:17.980]  You don't just search rat shaker?
[12:18.400 --> 12:19.420]  Oh, it's a loop.
[12:20.240 --> 12:21.000]  Find it.
[12:21.460 --> 12:22.100]  It is P.T.
[12:24.720 --> 12:26.120]  Help me find it, Gavin.
[12:26.120 --> 12:28.080]  Gavin, rat cheese.
[12:30.460 --> 12:31.660]  Everything lights up.
[12:32.000 --> 12:32.760]  It's going to be scary.
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.080]  Whoa!
[12:37.820 --> 12:39.680]  Did a rat just fly out of that TV?
[12:41.220 --> 12:41.700]  No.
[12:44.980 --> 12:47.020]  I'm cheese to meet you too.
[12:48.180 --> 12:49.240]  You mean rats?
[12:50.020 --> 12:51.560]  Dude, this is crazy.
[12:51.840 --> 12:54.000]  I hope we live in a world where this becomes the next
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.180]  Five Nights at Freddy's.
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.260]  I feel the same way.
[12:58.500 --> 12:59.220]  Well, quick.
[12:59.300 --> 13:01.760]  We should try and buy the rights to this rat before anyone else does.
[13:02.060 --> 13:04.800]  Who do you think is going to star in the rat shaker movie?
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.340]  Chris Pratt.
[13:06.920 --> 13:07.500]  Oh, you think so?
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.280]  The other side of the screen duo.
[13:10.440 --> 13:12.180]  Five Nights at Freddy's and Matthew Lillard.
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.740]  I think Skeet Ulrich would be perfect.
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.960]  I think it's Sebastian Stan.
[13:17.480 --> 13:18.200]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[13:18.380 --> 13:19.380]  I like that.
[13:19.580 --> 13:22.000]  I think it might be a return for Mike Myers.
[13:22.000 --> 13:22.400]  Uh-oh.
[13:22.420 --> 13:23.240]  Uh-oh.
[13:28.100 --> 13:28.980]  Rat down!
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.880]  You got cooked, rat.
[13:32.320 --> 13:32.600]  Uh-oh.
[13:32.860 --> 13:35.600]  Well, that'll do it for my blindside.
[13:35.660 --> 13:36.180]  What do you mean?
[13:36.280 --> 13:38.760]  What do you mean?
[13:39.100 --> 13:42.780]  Guys, we have to record two episodes, remember?
[13:43.140 --> 13:44.040]  Why the fuck would you do that?
[13:44.040 --> 13:46.040]  Well, you blindsided us into this.
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.240]  Now we're in the rat's adventure.
[13:48.640 --> 13:50.380]  Alright, we'll play a little bit more.
[13:50.380 --> 13:52.220]  And then we have to record some episodes, guys.
[13:52.340 --> 13:54.180]  We can't just be playing rat shaker all day.
[13:54.420 --> 13:56.560]  I think you binned the second one when you brought out the rat shaker.
[13:57.240 --> 13:57.640]  Yeah.
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.060]  I swear to God, if we have to record an episode tomorrow before the stream...
[14:02.060 --> 14:02.560]  We do.
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.760]  We do now.
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.440]  Okay, so I can turn stuff on in this level, but it explodes.
[14:10.700 --> 14:11.680]  Something to think about.
[14:12.500 --> 14:12.760]  Watch.
[14:13.980 --> 14:15.520]  Because this blew up last time, right?
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.760]  Yeah. You just gotta blow everything up until you find it.
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.500]  I think so.
[14:20.060 --> 14:23.040]  I just pulled up a full game playthrough of rat shaker.
[14:23.160 --> 14:23.900]  You're halfway through.
[14:24.440 --> 14:24.720]  Really?
[14:25.040 --> 14:27.960]  Get out of this room.
[14:28.600 --> 14:29.540]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[14:29.920 --> 14:31.100]  Gas leak.
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.320]  Oh, shit!
[14:35.080 --> 14:37.080]  Alright, so that's not it.
[14:37.440 --> 14:38.000]  Maybe not.
[14:38.680 --> 14:39.580]  Nope. Nope.
[14:40.200 --> 14:41.120]  Okay, here we go.
[14:41.720 --> 14:44.240]  Hang on, I gotta get my rat points up.
[14:45.500 --> 14:46.640]  I'll bet the tub's got something.
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.060]  Should I blow up this TV right now or wait?
[14:51.960 --> 14:52.440]  Do it now.
[14:52.720 --> 14:53.760]  Yeah, do it now. We're here.
[14:54.440 --> 14:55.360]  Ooh, what's this?
[14:55.960 --> 14:56.620]  It's a lamp.
[14:57.520 --> 14:58.760]  Oh, okay. I guess it's the whole thing.
[15:00.220 --> 15:01.500]  You gotta find it.
[15:01.560 --> 15:01.620]  What?
[15:04.840 --> 15:05.560]  Spooky rat.
[15:06.040 --> 15:06.160]  Oh!
[15:08.360 --> 15:09.940]  This makes me think you're on the right path.
[15:10.440 --> 15:10.780]  Yeah.
[15:11.240 --> 15:14.220]  Feels like a long time ago we were standing in a wheat field, huh?
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.260]  It does.
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.240]  Yeah, I think we all got over the initial shock pretty quickly.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.260]  Now we're all on board.
[15:22.980 --> 15:24.800]  Do you think Kojima made this?
[15:25.200 --> 15:25.460]  Yeah.
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.220]  He wishes.
[15:27.540 --> 15:29.360]  This is why they kicked him out of Konami.
[15:30.620 --> 15:37.040]  This is like when a famous groundbreaking director's kid makes a movie like one of David Lynch's kids, you know?
[15:37.100 --> 15:37.280]  Yeah.
[15:37.400 --> 15:38.920]  By Kojima's kid made this.
[15:39.020 --> 15:39.380]  Yep.
[15:42.820 --> 15:44.220]  Dude, I'm a big rat shaker head.
[15:44.300 --> 15:45.400]  Okay, so we got this full.
[15:45.840 --> 15:46.940]  We got that full.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.160]  So we're good here.
[15:48.520 --> 15:50.160]  We can try this.
[15:50.480 --> 15:50.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.080]  Nope, didn't do anything.
[15:54.180 --> 15:54.960]  Doesn't do nothing.
[15:55.920 --> 15:57.140]  I think you gotta go to the other room.
[15:58.040 --> 15:58.200]  Yep.
[15:59.140 --> 16:01.640]  I think Andrew's watching the playthrough and leading us on.
[16:02.260 --> 16:02.860]  Oh, this is it.
[16:03.000 --> 16:03.260]  Oh!
[16:05.320 --> 16:07.080]  We can't undo what we've done!
[16:07.080 --> 16:08.140]  Look up!
[16:08.640 --> 16:09.900]  It's raiding rats.
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.780]  Oh, that kid was eaten by rats.
[16:14.880 --> 16:14.940]  Oh!
[16:16.680 --> 16:19.700]  This is like a cut episode of Max Payne.
[16:20.160 --> 16:20.340]  Yeah.
[16:20.740 --> 16:21.620]  Guys, we're halfway!
[16:25.600 --> 16:28.000]  Wasn't this a Crispin Glover movie?
[16:28.900 --> 16:29.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:30.700 --> 16:32.660]  This is me shaking the shit out of Ben.
[16:35.840 --> 16:36.620]  All right.
[16:36.660 --> 16:38.580]  I guess we just keep going, huh?
[16:38.840 --> 16:39.000]  Yeah.
[16:39.140 --> 16:39.960]  Good luck, man.
[16:40.280 --> 16:41.340]  Thanks, bud.
[16:42.280 --> 16:42.520]  Ah!
[16:42.940 --> 16:45.980]  I don't know, something scared me, though.
[16:46.120 --> 16:46.640]  Ow!
[16:47.540 --> 16:49.220]  Can you put the picture together?
[16:50.320 --> 16:50.680]  No.
[16:51.240 --> 16:55.040]  If I saw a blurry little dude, I don't think I would...
[16:55.040 --> 16:55.880]  Oh, shit!
[17:00.930 --> 17:02.890]  Are we playing our first
[17:02.890 --> 17:04.250]  horror game right now?
[17:04.350 --> 17:04.750]  Yep.
[17:05.110 --> 17:05.710]  Whoa!
[17:09.230 --> 17:09.830]  Yep.
[17:10.610 --> 17:11.350]  It's factual.
[17:13.210 --> 17:13.810]  Wow!
[17:17.090 --> 17:18.030]  Find her!
[17:18.910 --> 17:20.470]  This is the dumbest fucking thing.
[17:21.210 --> 17:22.290]  Oh, God.
[17:22.750 --> 17:24.710]  I waited all year for this blindside, guys.
[17:24.850 --> 17:26.390]  It looks like it has ray tracing.
[17:26.650 --> 17:27.830]  Anti-gravity microwave.
[17:28.150 --> 17:28.650]  Yeah, it does.
[17:29.470 --> 17:30.650]  They gotta run back the
[17:30.650 --> 17:32.610]  Game Award nominations that just came out.
[17:32.690 --> 17:34.490]  We got a new contender, Game of the Year.
[17:34.710 --> 17:35.470]  What is that?
[17:35.970 --> 17:37.370]  Is that a dummy or a man?
[17:39.210 --> 17:40.590]  What the f...
[17:40.590 --> 17:41.570]  Is it like a meat man?
[17:41.930 --> 17:42.970]  I think it's a meat man.
[17:45.010 --> 17:45.410]  Whoa!
[17:46.250 --> 17:46.570]  Bottle.
[17:49.190 --> 17:49.810]  Oh, what is that?
[17:49.830 --> 17:51.070]  It's just a bunch of meat people.
[17:52.770 --> 17:54.310]  Can I not go?
[17:54.650 --> 17:55.090]  Oh, I went.
[17:55.090 --> 17:57.290]  Is it a man made of rat meat?
[18:01.700 --> 18:03.280]  Spiritual successor to dog meat?
[18:04.180 --> 18:04.240]  What?
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.160]  I can't see where I'm going.
[18:07.360 --> 18:07.780]  At all.
[18:08.280 --> 18:10.100]  I don't think you're supposed to go there.
[18:10.200 --> 18:11.320]  You don't think so?
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.240]  There's nowhere else to go.
[18:14.380 --> 18:17.260]  That's a good point. Can you interact with the door
[18:17.260 --> 18:17.820]  from the outside?
[18:21.980 --> 18:22.460]  No.
[18:23.180 --> 18:25.440]  Do you have an inventory or anything?
[18:26.040 --> 18:26.400]  No.
[18:26.400 --> 18:27.460]  No. This is it.
[18:27.980 --> 18:29.800]  I can shake a rat or I can choke a rat.
[18:30.160 --> 18:33.160]  Does choking the rat make your meat go down?
[18:33.600 --> 18:33.920]  Yes.
[18:34.520 --> 18:36.480]  And then I have to shake the rat to get it back up.
[18:46.180 --> 18:48.160]  I'm trying. Are there stairs?
[18:48.840 --> 18:49.180]  Am I?
[18:49.820 --> 18:50.980]  No, it doesn't look like it.
[18:50.980 --> 18:51.440]  No.
[18:54.500 --> 18:56.800]  Can you push the meat man out?
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.920]  No, you just walk right through him.
[18:59.320 --> 19:00.180]  Maybe I go back up.
[19:00.380 --> 19:01.460]  Yeah, go back to the house.
[19:04.540 --> 19:06.440]  Maybe we got ahead of ourselves.
[19:07.720 --> 19:09.020]  I don't think so.
[19:09.160 --> 19:09.720]  You think so?
[19:10.040 --> 19:10.660]  I don't know.
[19:16.400 --> 19:17.160]  EV room.
[19:18.120 --> 19:19.120]  Should I jump in?
[19:19.880 --> 19:20.480]  Yeah, try.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.240]  Oh, shit.
[19:24.440 --> 19:25.440]  I think you died.
[19:25.740 --> 19:26.560]  Oh, you became one.
[19:27.720 --> 19:29.240]  Oh, it just reset me.
[19:30.780 --> 19:32.560]  So I think this is where we're supposed to be
[19:32.560 --> 19:33.560]  if it put me back here, right?
[19:33.920 --> 19:35.500]  Maybe that little dude that you kicked apart
[19:35.500 --> 19:36.640]  was a part of the problem.
[19:40.200 --> 19:41.740]  Do I just keep going straight?
[19:42.020 --> 19:43.020]  I don't think I can.
[19:43.140 --> 19:45.460]  I don't think so. What even is that thing on the roof?
[19:45.540 --> 19:46.580]  Oh, oh, oh.
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.260]  Wait, no, this is where we came from, isn't it?
[19:48.260 --> 19:48.800]  Yeah, fuck.
[19:49.820 --> 19:51.280]  What's hanging in front of the light?
[19:53.100 --> 19:54.420]  I can't interact with it.
[19:55.120 --> 19:55.700]  Just the wall?
[19:56.320 --> 19:56.560]  Yeah.
[20:00.500 --> 20:01.820]  Sorry, I gotta get my rat meter up.
[20:01.980 --> 20:02.700]  Yeah, try boosting.
[20:08.840 --> 20:10.800]  It looks like you're turning the lights off.
[20:10.880 --> 20:11.880]  Maybe turn all the lights off?
[20:12.980 --> 20:14.260]  I can't. There's nothing to...
[20:14.260 --> 20:15.440]  Oh, wait. Oh, that was the door.
[20:15.440 --> 20:17.640]  Yeah. And I can't do anything
[20:17.640 --> 20:19.140]  with this door, I don't think.
[20:20.800 --> 20:22.360]  Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[20:24.160 --> 20:25.260]  Andrew, look at the playthrough.
[20:25.380 --> 20:25.700]  What do we do?
[20:25.880 --> 20:27.460]  Yeah, I'm skipping.
[20:32.120 --> 20:33.060]  Okay, dude.
[20:33.500 --> 20:34.600]  That one actually hurt.
[20:34.920 --> 20:37.680]  Okay, so we go through...
[20:38.560 --> 20:39.400]  What am I missing?
[20:40.440 --> 20:41.760]  I'm just holding forward
[20:41.760 --> 20:43.120]  and it's like...
[20:45.700 --> 20:47.400]  And they go through the door.
[20:48.520 --> 20:48.920]  Wait.
[20:49.240 --> 20:50.240]  No, it's a corridor.
[20:50.840 --> 20:51.100]  Oh.
[20:52.820 --> 20:53.860]  Hey, we found it.
[20:54.260 --> 20:54.920]  Yeah, you found it.
[20:55.660 --> 20:56.820]  Hey, this is covered in rats.
[20:56.880 --> 20:57.640]  Is that good or bad?
[20:59.760 --> 21:01.120]  Alright, if you say so.
[21:01.260 --> 21:01.740]  It looks fine.
[21:02.460 --> 21:04.000]  There you go. That's what I'm talking about, Nick.
[21:04.280 --> 21:04.880]  They're distracted.
[21:05.120 --> 21:05.220]  Okay.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.220]  Do I turn this on?
[21:09.220 --> 21:09.460]  No.
[21:11.480 --> 21:12.640]  We know what happens.
[21:13.300 --> 21:15.200]  It doesn't leave it up to Gavin, but that's fine.
[21:15.320 --> 21:15.940]  I would have said yeah.
[21:16.800 --> 21:18.320]  That's why we're not leaving it up to Gavin.
[21:18.580 --> 21:19.040]  That's fair.
[21:21.620 --> 21:23.460]  There's rat poison everywhere.
[21:23.740 --> 21:24.680]  Do I turn these on again, you think?
[21:25.080 --> 21:26.460]  I gotta flush this.
[21:27.220 --> 21:28.260]  Please flush that.
[21:29.520 --> 21:30.820]  Don't put your finger on it.
[21:33.760 --> 21:35.840]  Poos, this game is the worst.
[21:38.460 --> 21:40.460]  Just think, we could be doing two episodes right now.
[21:40.600 --> 21:42.160]  Can you get in the shower?
[21:42.660 --> 21:43.540]  Clean off a little bit?
[21:44.140 --> 21:44.600]  It's a good idea.
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.520]  Oh, a blood pan.
[21:47.320 --> 21:48.660]  I bet you don't have blood in the tub.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.900]  This doesn't turn on this time.
[21:51.300 --> 21:52.000]  Look behind you.
[21:55.160 --> 21:56.380]  Are you going to drown?
[21:56.800 --> 21:57.420]  It's like Minecraft.
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.440]  Gavin, is this good or bad?
[21:59.700 --> 22:00.080]  Bad.
[22:01.120 --> 22:01.800]  No, it's fine.
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.020]  Okay, cool.
[22:05.320 --> 22:05.720]  Whoa!
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.080]  I think he died.
[22:08.180 --> 22:09.800]  I guess so.
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.000]  Too much blood.
[22:11.700 --> 22:13.560]  Alright, so don't do that.
[22:14.080 --> 22:15.240]  We gotta ignore the bathroom.
[22:15.620 --> 22:16.100]  Just keep going.
[22:18.400 --> 22:20.720]  No matter how bad you have to go,
[22:20.800 --> 22:21.800]  you're gonna have to hold it.
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.560]  Is this the way we're supposed to go?
[22:23.820 --> 22:24.440]  Is it the other way?
[22:24.800 --> 22:26.800]  Just keep going?
[22:26.900 --> 22:28.800]  We're not stopping for another 110 miles.
[22:28.960 --> 22:31.400]  So it is this way, and then to the right, I guess.
[22:32.020 --> 22:32.840]  There we go.
[22:40.020 --> 22:42.100]  So there's this that we haven't done yet.
[22:43.120 --> 22:43.560]  But...
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.540]  That's the bathroom. We don't need to fuck with that.
[22:45.920 --> 22:47.000]  This was the room with...
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.540]  Oh, the rat baby thing.
[22:50.840 --> 22:51.280]  Gross.
[22:52.280 --> 22:53.460]  Oh, nothing here.
[22:53.740 --> 22:54.720]  There we go.
[22:56.240 --> 22:56.680]  Whoa!
[22:59.120 --> 23:01.500]  Does it worry you that people make games like this?
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.360]  No, I think this is great.
[23:03.580 --> 23:05.500]  Like, who was the first person born
[23:05.500 --> 23:07.020]  who thought like this?
[23:07.620 --> 23:07.920]  Yeah.
[23:09.120 --> 23:10.260]  Might just be this guy.
[23:11.380 --> 23:13.100]  This is probably the kind of shit
[23:13.100 --> 23:15.140]  guys like H.P. Lovecraft would have done
[23:15.140 --> 23:16.560]  if they were born in 2004.
[23:17.560 --> 23:17.820]  Yes.
[23:18.600 --> 23:20.140]  It's this and the back rooms.
[23:20.960 --> 23:24.000]  Okay, so I activated this TV.
[23:24.220 --> 23:24.440]  Uh oh.
[23:26.900 --> 23:28.320]  The rat died?!
[23:28.320 --> 23:29.180]  You killed the rat.
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.540]  I thought he was immortal.
[23:30.760 --> 23:32.560]  Well, we're in the upside down world.
[23:32.960 --> 23:33.560]  Oh no.
[23:38.200 --> 23:39.680]  Let me out!
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.600]  The rat was keeping you safe.
[23:43.360 --> 23:44.420]  From the rats.
[23:44.820 --> 23:46.000]  It won't let me out!
[23:46.660 --> 23:48.540]  Oh, you're fucking...
[23:48.540 --> 23:50.200]  What the fuck?
[23:51.080 --> 23:52.280]  You got ate by rats.
[23:52.820 --> 23:54.040]  Alright, so don't do that.
[23:55.040 --> 23:56.540]  Or do that and then do something else.
[23:58.300 --> 23:59.800]  I didn't know the rat could die.
[24:00.640 --> 24:02.100]  You killed it with the TV?
[24:02.540 --> 24:03.860]  I don't think he knew he could die either.
[24:04.340 --> 24:04.560]  Yeah.
[24:05.800 --> 24:06.200]  Okay.
[24:07.060 --> 24:08.960]  So this way...
[24:09.460 --> 24:10.200]  Find it.
[24:10.280 --> 24:11.960]  Okay, so we know we blew him up with the TV.
[24:13.860 --> 24:14.940]  Which was this way.
[24:20.480 --> 24:22.300]  Then it's like, find her.
[24:23.160 --> 24:23.440]  Yeah.
[24:24.540 --> 24:25.240]  Okay, let's see.
[24:25.460 --> 24:27.200]  Maybe if we activate this TV and then go?
[24:27.840 --> 24:29.040]  Like, don't stay here?
[24:29.500 --> 24:30.840]  Maybe you have to go and look at the other TV.
[24:30.840 --> 24:32.020]  Because you killed the rat immediately, right?
[24:32.120 --> 24:32.920]  And you need the rat.
[24:33.800 --> 24:35.940]  It blew up because we were standing next to it, I think.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.880]  The rat is our fucking hall pass.
[24:40.140 --> 24:41.180]  Yep. Okay, there we go.
[24:42.100 --> 24:42.940]  Oh, that's a good sign.
[24:43.420 --> 24:45.160]  Turn it into a glow stick.
[24:45.180 --> 24:45.700]  Glow stick?
[24:46.080 --> 24:47.260]  You've got a glow rat.
[24:47.760 --> 24:49.180]  Yeah, glow rat!
[24:49.560 --> 24:51.040]  You have a nasty rat-itude.
[24:53.140 --> 24:56.260]  It's kind of lighting up your own eyes more than it is the area in front of you.
[25:02.500 --> 25:02.860]  Yeah.
[25:02.920 --> 25:05.300]  Wow, I'm just going, man.
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.660]  We just keep going, you think?
[25:07.460 --> 25:10.320]  I want a prequel. I want to know how we found this rat.
[25:10.800 --> 25:12.680]  How did we end up in the field?
[25:14.120 --> 25:16.000]  You know at the end of...
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.300]  Is it end of Portal or Portal 2 you end up in a field?
[25:19.640 --> 25:20.000]  Yes.
[25:20.240 --> 25:20.700]  Portal 2.
[25:21.160 --> 25:23.520]  Yeah, maybe this is the sequel to Portal 2.
[25:24.640 --> 25:25.120]  Whoa!
[25:25.600 --> 25:26.800]  Is this a cage?
[25:29.460 --> 25:30.820]  Despite all my rage?
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.320]  Turns out you were the rat the whole time.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.300]  Okay, should I go to this thing?
[25:35.260 --> 25:35.900]  What's that?
[25:36.120 --> 25:36.540]  The radio?
[25:48.520 --> 25:51.060]  Did you fully prompt the radio to do it?
[25:51.060 --> 25:53.320]  I did because it sapped my whole meter.
[25:53.460 --> 25:53.680]  Watch.
[25:55.760 --> 25:57.340]  My whole rat meter goes away.
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.420]  Can you shake and...
[25:59.980 --> 26:01.180]  Can you charge and action?
[26:01.520 --> 26:01.840]  Or no?
[26:02.940 --> 26:03.840]  Oh, I guess I can.
[26:09.280 --> 26:10.860]  But it doesn't make this go up.
[26:11.100 --> 26:11.220]  Ah.
[26:12.540 --> 26:14.760]  So, there was another way over here.
[26:17.710 --> 26:20.150]  Eric, did you ever play P.T.?
[26:20.150 --> 26:20.430]  Yeah.
[26:21.130 --> 26:21.990]  Was it scary?
[26:22.730 --> 26:25.550]  Yeah. I mean, I didn't play it. I watched somebody play it. Fuck that.
[26:25.750 --> 26:27.150]  It's very scary. Holy shit.
[26:29.330 --> 26:31.010]  It's mostly like this.
[26:31.010 --> 26:32.830]  Three hours of me looking at my feet.
[26:33.370 --> 26:35.050]  Yeah, I played it kind of like Geoff.
[26:36.810 --> 26:40.130]  I'm excited to see what the Kojima horror game that's coming out on Xbox.
[26:40.890 --> 26:41.550]  Oh, yeah!
[26:42.590 --> 26:46.890]  There is a lot of beds and cages here.
[26:48.510 --> 26:50.330]  Busted furniture. Is that all toilets?
[26:52.130 --> 26:53.050]  Taped up box?
[26:56.820 --> 26:59.580]  If you replace toilets with desk chairs, that's my room.
[27:02.760 --> 27:04.300]  I think this is where I came in, isn't it?
[27:04.540 --> 27:04.680]  No?
[27:08.280 --> 27:09.780]  I don't think I've been this way.
[27:10.260 --> 27:12.320]  No, this is new.
[27:13.740 --> 27:15.240]  Oh, we didn't find...
[27:15.240 --> 27:15.720]  Oh, wait, wait.
[27:18.020 --> 27:19.140]  That's a living man.
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.960]  There you go.
[27:22.920 --> 27:23.580]  Door's open.
[27:24.180 --> 27:25.660]  Man, that is a creepy smile.
[27:26.640 --> 27:29.540]  Is it going to be that we're actually choking her, not the rat?
[27:29.840 --> 27:30.840]  And we just think it's a rat?
[27:32.920 --> 27:35.280]  I thought you were walking into a jail cell for a minute.
[27:36.140 --> 27:37.120]  I think I am.
[27:37.240 --> 27:38.260]  I'm here to rat myself out.
[27:39.620 --> 27:40.340]  What the hell?
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.200]  He's just talking to me now.
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.780]  I feel like he's been talking to you a long time.
[27:47.240 --> 27:49.540]  No, no, but that was unprompted.
[27:49.680 --> 27:51.560]  I didn't hit a button and he started talking to me.
[27:51.740 --> 27:53.540]  Every other time it's because I'm hitting something.
[27:55.540 --> 27:58.040]  He's been talking to you a long time now.
[27:59.980 --> 28:01.920]  I'm just bummed that we discovered the controller.
[28:01.920 --> 28:03.720]  It would have been funny if you were doing this while looking at the thing.
[28:03.720 --> 28:05.780]  Doing this the whole time like that? Oh my god.
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.580]  It's like a corn maze.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.600]  Yeah, I don't...
[28:13.600 --> 28:15.280]  I guess I keep going?
[28:18.600 --> 28:18.920]  Yeah.
[28:20.100 --> 28:20.420]  Yeah.
[28:22.640 --> 28:23.540]  Yeah, tell him, Geoff.
[28:24.840 --> 28:25.720]  Get him, get him, get him.
[28:26.960 --> 28:28.000]  I just like the way you said it.
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.600]  Where am I?
[28:29.600 --> 28:30.800]  Oh, do I need to go in?
[28:31.120 --> 28:35.080]  Maybe I have to go back to that middle...
[28:35.080 --> 28:36.280]  where that bed was.
[28:38.900 --> 28:40.180]  Or maybe not?
[28:41.580 --> 28:44.360]  Oh, they're all rats.
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.720]  Are they talking about rat race recently?
[28:47.900 --> 28:49.360]  Wow, look at all this rat art.
[28:49.980 --> 28:51.600]  You know you're wasting your time.
[28:52.360 --> 28:53.620]  We were going to play Rat Craft.
[28:53.620 --> 28:55.180]  Yep.
[28:57.440 --> 28:57.920]  Whoa.
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.440]  What the?
[29:05.420 --> 29:07.420]  There's our final picture piece.
[29:08.020 --> 29:08.820]  It's the last one.
[29:09.780 --> 29:11.280]  I think the meat man will get up.
[29:15.860 --> 29:17.100]  Shut up.
[29:19.520 --> 29:20.000]  Ew.
[29:23.840 --> 29:25.080]  You might be right, Gavin.
[29:26.380 --> 29:28.060]  Oh, I thought he said antiquities.
[29:29.980 --> 29:30.420]  Okay.
[29:37.850 --> 29:39.570]  I like giving him little jokes.
[29:42.650 --> 29:43.090]  Huh.
[29:48.130 --> 29:49.450]  Are you going to turn the corner
[29:49.450 --> 29:51.190]  and go to a room with like Chuck E. Cheese
[29:51.190 --> 29:52.490]  just looking at the wall?
[29:53.990 --> 29:54.870]  Blair Witch?
[29:55.270 --> 29:55.410]  Yeah.
[29:55.410 --> 29:55.490]  Yeah.
[29:56.890 --> 29:58.070]  Can't do anything here.
[29:59.250 --> 30:00.130]  Nothing there.
[30:00.630 --> 30:01.690]  Oh, there's a red room.
[30:02.910 --> 30:04.690]  Red room is never good in this context.
[30:05.070 --> 30:05.870]  What do you mean?
[30:07.070 --> 30:08.310]  Oh, check it out, boys.
[30:09.090 --> 30:10.030]  TV, blow it up.
[30:11.350 --> 30:12.230]  Let's see.
[30:13.790 --> 30:14.610]  Okay, let's go.
[30:15.330 --> 30:16.550]  We're going to make the run.
[30:16.990 --> 30:19.030]  Definitely in that room in Alan Wake 2.
[30:20.030 --> 30:20.670]  Here we go.
[30:20.950 --> 30:21.950]  Are you in your mind palace?
[30:21.950 --> 30:23.310]  Oh, God.
[30:25.770 --> 30:27.490]  Oh, no.
[30:27.510 --> 30:28.210]  That's your wife?
[30:29.150 --> 30:29.550]  No.
[30:31.610 --> 30:31.970]  Sorry.
[30:33.430 --> 30:34.530]  She's reduced to rat food.
[30:34.890 --> 30:35.850]  Why'd you do that?
[30:35.970 --> 30:37.250]  You are the wife shaker.
[30:38.310 --> 30:39.630]  Was I right?
[30:40.250 --> 30:43.750]  Gavin, what is it about you
[30:43.750 --> 30:45.430]  that you were able to identify
[30:45.430 --> 30:46.390]  so easily?
[30:46.390 --> 30:46.730]  Hahaha.
[30:50.170 --> 30:50.950]  Oh!
[30:54.100 --> 30:55.630]  What was that?
[30:56.050 --> 30:57.390]  Rat shaker.
[30:58.170 --> 30:58.210]  Why?
[30:59.530 --> 31:01.490]  Oh, it's a game jam.
[31:03.050 --> 31:04.650]  Way to go, Squeaks.
[31:05.110 --> 31:06.130]  That makes more sense.
[31:06.630 --> 31:07.070]  Yeah.
[31:08.990 --> 31:10.910]  We have to record an episode now.
[31:11.450 --> 31:11.590]  Two.
[31:11.790 --> 31:12.810]  We have to record two.
[31:14.090 --> 31:14.550]  Guys.
[31:15.670 --> 31:16.570]  We did it.
[31:17.730 --> 31:18.470]  Not again.
[31:18.930 --> 31:20.070]  Guys, that was Rat Shaker.
[31:20.190 --> 31:21.250]  That was my blindside.
[31:21.570 --> 31:24.170]  Found out about it yesterday.
[31:24.630 --> 31:25.870]  Was very excited about it today.
[31:26.210 --> 31:27.610]  There you have it.
[31:28.690 --> 31:29.850]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[31:30.990 --> 31:32.030]  We'll see you next time.
[31:32.070 --> 31:33.490]  Who can do another blindside? No one.
[31:33.610 --> 31:33.930]  Bye!
