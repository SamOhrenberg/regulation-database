[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  Guys, we can't show what's on my screen.
[00:02.860 --> 00:05.720]  Uh, I... we need to do another heist. I'm out of money.
[00:06.640 --> 00:07.300]  Are you in the script?
[00:08.320 --> 00:13.840]  Well, I... I haven't left. I have not left. Someone needs to invite me somewhere. I cannot...
[00:14.440 --> 00:19.700]  I've been... I've been stuck in a dance. Uh, don't tell my wife. This is not good for me.
[00:19.920 --> 00:23.880]  We need to do something to get more money now. Now. Should I tell your sponsor?
[00:24.540 --> 00:27.380]  Andrew. Andrew. Oh, we can't show this. Andrew. Oh.
[00:28.960 --> 00:31.140]  I'm waiting for Lester to call me.
[00:31.740 --> 00:35.940]  It's all right. We'll call Lester. Gavin and I are a little busy hunting, uh, motorcyclists.
[00:38.200 --> 00:39.720]  Oh, I thought we were hunting milfs.
[00:45.060 --> 00:48.020]  I've been following that guy for a long time.
[00:50.600 --> 00:51.080]  Oh.
[00:53.080 --> 00:54.820]  Got him. All right, Justice.
[00:55.480 --> 00:56.720]  Eric. What?
[00:57.160 --> 01:01.900]  Are you okay? I need help. I need to get out of here. I've been trapped in this place for weeks.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.260]  I've been in this club. I've been... it just... under this...
[01:05.260 --> 01:09.340]  The only light that I've seen for weeks is this beautiful lady's neon sign.
[01:09.540 --> 01:12.520]  I don't know what to do. Help. We need to get out of here.
[01:12.860 --> 01:16.700]  We need to... I need to get invited to this crew, guys. We gotta make money.
[01:17.880 --> 01:19.200]  I'll make... I'll set up the crew.
[01:19.900 --> 01:24.780]  Please. Hair associates. I don't like addicted, Eric. There we go. I... I can't do...
[01:24.780 --> 01:29.340]  There's nothing I can do about this. I'm trapped. Yeah, but do you remember how to start the next heist?
[01:30.680 --> 01:31.080]  No.
[01:32.080 --> 01:36.840]  Yeah, I don't think I've done it before so I think I just have to wait for the game to be like, hey, what?
[01:37.720 --> 01:38.520]  Is that right?
[01:39.840 --> 01:45.840]  Well, I called Lester and he wouldn't let me do anything. Wow, Lester's kind of a dick. And I went into my apartment
[01:46.480 --> 01:48.380]  and it just says join a heist.
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.420]  Okay. Doesn't give me an option to start one.
[01:51.420 --> 01:51.820]  Huh.
[01:53.200 --> 01:53.780]  Let me double check.
[01:54.620 --> 01:56.540]  Go back in. Can you call him?
[01:57.400 --> 02:02.740]  I did and it didn't give me any options to like initiate the next heist. Don't call him. He'll call you.
[02:03.180 --> 02:07.220]  Last time we called at the strip club, he's like, I'll call you when I get everything set up.
[02:08.260 --> 02:09.900]  Gavin! So I think I might have to just wait.
[02:13.060 --> 02:16.320]  What the? Where'd you go? I'll just drive around the city for a little bit.
[02:16.780 --> 02:17.140]  Gavin?
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.040]  Hello. You've abandoned me. Where'd you go?
[02:20.700 --> 02:26.080]  Oh, there you go. We're just splitting the attention. Okay. I drove into a tree. Did I do good?
[02:28.240 --> 02:34.000]  I'll call you every five seconds in this game and when I want to call, zero calls. Oh, it's like real life too.
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.320]  Let's drive around a little bit. Are you busy right now? I'm gonna call you five times. I just housed a whole BLT.
[02:39.860 --> 02:40.420]  Whoa, really?
[02:41.500 --> 02:42.300]  Yeah. Good.
[02:43.280 --> 02:43.400]  Oh.
[02:44.100 --> 02:44.980]  What type of bread?
[02:45.800 --> 02:50.020]  Oh, I don't remember. Guys, guys, we have to start this next thing. Another
[02:51.140 --> 02:53.880]  woman approached me asking if I want to dance and I had to say yes.
[02:54.180 --> 02:59.380]  I don't know. You have to get me out of here. I need time. All these women like me.
[03:00.780 --> 03:02.160]  They all like me too much.
[03:02.860 --> 03:04.520]  They like me and my wallet a lot.
[03:05.180 --> 03:08.740]  Eric, you should just go live and stream yourself going broke on this stripper.
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.740]  See how long it takes. We cannot show any of this. We can't show this.
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.160]  Well, sometimes she's not in a position where it looks like her growl is about to pop out.
[03:19.480 --> 03:26.160]  I mean, I'm trying to keep the camera off of it just in case, but it's not good, guys. It's not good.
[03:26.520 --> 03:27.220]  This is not good.
[03:29.580 --> 03:30.960]  We have to do something.
[03:32.220 --> 03:34.480]  I'm just waiting. I don't know. I'm gonna... We're waiting on Lester.
[03:35.500 --> 03:36.460]  Do you have a good time?
[03:37.480 --> 03:42.560]  And just sparingly, you know, make it rain. Nah, you gotta keep the torrent coming. Oh.
[03:43.320 --> 03:45.440]  We do need a downpour. It's true.
[03:47.240 --> 03:47.760]  Whoops.
[03:49.620 --> 03:50.140]  Gavin?
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.620]  What happened?
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.620]  I got a little close to one of my bombs.
[03:58.600 --> 04:03.880]  Uh-oh. Your CEO left. I'm no longer a member of an organization. They're gonna like me less.
[04:05.980 --> 04:07.800]  Now you're unemployed. No!
[04:08.420 --> 04:09.140]  Not again!
[04:10.260 --> 04:15.940]  Oh, the fire department's put out my car. That's nice of them. Oh, it's really nice. In the rain, is it? In the rain.
[04:16.740 --> 04:17.340]  Give me this.
[04:23.300 --> 04:23.620]  Oh!
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.700]  Off I go to Andrew's world. Oh, do we have invites? Yeah, I sent invites out. Oh, I didn't see. Thank God. Get me out of here.
[04:33.660 --> 04:39.320]  I'm... Oh, I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. Thank God. I really hope it just respawns you back.
[04:39.320 --> 04:39.500]  No!
[04:41.800 --> 04:43.440]  Right into a lap dance.
[04:45.060 --> 04:48.560]  My worst nightmare! Ah! I woke up here!
[04:52.180 --> 04:53.960]  I woke up here.
[04:56.340 --> 04:59.840]  I swear, honey, I just woke up here. That's what I have to tell her.
[05:00.340 --> 05:01.840]  I just... I don't know what happened.
[05:02.660 --> 05:05.580]  Oh, I'm... I'm like in the back alley of this place. Oh, no.
[05:05.580 --> 05:12.540]  It's making it sleep rain, huh? Yeah. Oh, invite me to your, uh, crew or whatever, Andrew. Making it sleep rain.
[05:12.960 --> 05:13.620]  Yeah, man.
[05:14.120 --> 05:20.140]  When I... when I said I like to sleep to rain sounds, this isn't what I meant. Oh, brother. Oh, no.
[05:20.580 --> 05:21.720]  Wait, wait a second.
[05:24.480 --> 05:24.920]  Andrew.
[05:25.820 --> 05:27.380]  Gavin, what happened? Here we go.
[05:28.180 --> 05:28.640]  Where are you?
[05:29.320 --> 05:31.300]  Where are you? Where do you mean where am I?
[05:31.780 --> 05:34.320]  Where are you? Are you still in the club? I'm at the club!
[05:38.580 --> 05:42.680]  I'm in the offices of Fecal Beecle. I'm gonna pick you guys up. Please. Where are you guys all at?
[05:43.300 --> 05:44.200]  Come get me.
[05:44.780 --> 05:49.200]  I'm just calling your friend. What do you mean where am I? I'm at the club! What are you talking about? I'm trapped!
[05:51.580 --> 05:56.840]  Oh. Who's coming up? Where are you? Oh, there you are. I'm coming up.
[05:58.780 --> 06:00.200]  Nick, get in. I'm coming.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.680]  Are you gonna pick me up in a helicopter?
[06:03.520 --> 06:07.040]  No. No. What? I can pick you up in a helicopter. You're getting close.
[06:09.540 --> 06:13.340]  I'm really easy to find. Then we'll go get Eric. Who's this down here?
[06:15.120 --> 06:21.640]  Is Gavin the one in the skull? Why are you in a skull? Oh, that's why. Are you in a helicopter? Yeah. Oh, shit. Get in.
[06:21.840 --> 06:23.480]  Now here.
[06:24.340 --> 06:24.940]  Do you mind if I fly?
[06:26.060 --> 06:30.480]  Do you want to fly my helicopter? Yeah, I do. I think you have to be in my organization. God damn it.
[06:30.560 --> 06:31.780]  Well, join my organization.
[06:32.240 --> 06:35.840]  Well, then I won't be able to use this, will I? Okay. This is company property.
[06:36.520 --> 06:39.680]  Can you invite me to let me ride in your vehicle? Oh.
[06:42.700 --> 06:45.400]  Well, sorry, Nick. Gavin just cut Nick in half.
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.900]  Can I ride with you?
[06:49.840 --> 06:52.540]  Guys, if you don't get here soon, I'm afraid I might go back inside.
[06:53.220 --> 06:55.220]  All right, Nick, get in so we can pick up Eric. Okay.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.860]  Oh! Stop it!
[07:01.160 --> 07:03.060]  All right, all right, all right.
[07:03.140 --> 07:05.700]  Nick, chill out. I only cut you. I'm trying to unite the team.
[07:07.460 --> 07:08.080]  What the?
[07:11.740 --> 07:18.020]  I mean, you're kind of on my helipad. Guys, I'm a real Tom Hardy type where I gotta drink and go to this club and
[07:18.020 --> 07:20.340]  I'm like, I'm like Tom Hardy in Inception. Go get Eric!
[07:21.140 --> 07:24.960]  Eric, Gavin! Which direction? Can you mock him? I don't even know where he is. He's marked. He's marked.
[07:25.540 --> 07:28.460]  I meant, you know where the, you know where the shoe is? I meant the shoe.
[07:30.260 --> 07:35.000]  Go into the shoe. Is that the name of the club? Big on feet there, huh? You tell me.
[07:36.700 --> 07:37.320]  All right.
[07:37.940 --> 07:40.640]  I don't know why you brought it up.
[07:41.420 --> 07:42.900]  Because you're at the shoe!
[07:50.040 --> 07:50.900]  Oh, Gavin.
[07:52.180 --> 07:56.720]  Oh, that's not the shoe. Here we go. I'm over here. I'm over here. That's a parking garage.
[07:57.940 --> 07:59.980]  I'm over here. He's on the other side of the highway.
[08:00.620 --> 08:05.560]  Nick! I lived. I'm coming. Guys, you gotta land. I hear help. The dance has a hold of me.
[08:05.560 --> 08:08.360]  All four of us in one thing. The dance has a hold of me.
[08:09.120 --> 08:09.520]  Get outside.
[08:10.200 --> 08:11.560]  I'm right here. I'm on the roof.
[08:12.380 --> 08:13.120]  Oh, you're on the roof.
[08:14.820 --> 08:17.480]  How do you get on the roof? Well, I'm back. I'm to your left.
[08:19.300 --> 08:23.820]  Where are you? Oh, he's on the roof. He's dancing. He was looking at the shoe. Wait for me.
[08:23.960 --> 08:25.300]  That's the only way I can get out.
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.100]  Uh-oh, Ratman.
[08:27.100 --> 08:27.660]  On the roof?
[08:28.660 --> 08:32.240]  What's up, Rat? Let's do it, baby. Hold on. I'm almost here.
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.040]  Rat-spammer. Nick's got back in.
[08:35.820 --> 08:40.620]  Hey, Gavin, I need you. Once we're all in, take us all the way up to the, uh, to the north.
[08:41.420 --> 08:42.560]  All the way up north? Put the marker down.
[08:43.540 --> 08:48.700]  Yeah. Okay. Like to the top of the map? Top of the map. All right. Is this where the heist is?
[08:50.000 --> 08:50.720]  Uh, maybe.
[08:52.460 --> 08:52.820]  Are...
[08:52.820 --> 08:55.720]  Are we supposed to be in a crew? Are we all different colors right now?
[08:56.500 --> 09:01.720]  We are, but we'll reunite once we're... Okay. They'll join our crew once we get over there.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  Oh, dear. Who is that, Nick? Yeah, what the fuck, dude?
[09:10.060 --> 09:12.720]  That's such a Nick move. That was not Nick.
[09:13.460 --> 09:18.140]  I have no gun back here. Oh, wait, do I have a gun? Such a Nick move. You do. What are you talking about?
[09:18.260 --> 09:20.500]  Of course you do. Can I pull... Can I pull my gun? Do you think we can...
[09:20.500 --> 09:23.540]  Do you think we can make it through the D? Oh, I do have a gun. Yeah. I do.
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.220]  No, I think so. I think we can. If I die, I'm going... I'm going back to heaven, aka vanilla.
[09:29.220 --> 09:31.680]  I don't think we can make it through the D on foot.
[09:32.480 --> 09:34.480]  I mean, we flew a plane through the D once.
[09:35.040 --> 09:37.200]  Let's try a chopper. Oh, it's close.
[09:37.460 --> 09:38.460]  Oh, I don't think you can go through the D.
[09:40.520 --> 09:46.620]  Well, I got mugged on that. That sounds right. Maybe the best mugging of all time. Oh, wow. It says, uh,
[09:47.180 --> 09:51.660]  doing a job. We'll get Lester to call us. I'm taking us to a thing where we can do a quick job.
[09:52.220 --> 09:53.700]  That's great. Are you taking us to the dicks?
[09:54.480 --> 09:54.880]  No.
[09:56.060 --> 09:59.100]  Is this video started? Are we in this video? I mean, we're recording.
[09:59.960 --> 10:05.400]  Yeah, it's in the video. Welcome to the video. It started at some point. Hello. Probably. Hello.
[10:06.840 --> 10:12.220]  Eric, how much did you lose to the strip club? I'm broke. We need to do another heist, boys.
[10:12.500 --> 10:18.300]  We're doing a gig and that'll unlock the heist. We're doing a... listen, I got a business. Okay.
[10:18.820 --> 10:23.400]  What are we doing? You know, you're part of my organization. I am. It's not all fun and games. There's some real work.
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.820]  Oh my... gotta go over this mountain. One of the levels gone. That's good. Nick has joined an organization. That's great.
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.600]  Hey, what's up? Hey guys. Congratulations, dude.
[10:32.480 --> 10:38.400]  It was nice of you to let this other, uh... keep going up, Gavin. Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, up, Gavin, up. Keep going up.
[10:38.500 --> 10:40.220]  I mean, I'm flooring it. He's good.
[10:40.600 --> 10:42.840]  Stop holding forward. Stop. Why would you...
[10:42.840 --> 10:47.080]  We also want to make progress. Right. That's true. Okay, never mind. I take it back.
[10:47.780 --> 10:49.920]  It's time versus distance versus height.
[10:52.100 --> 10:55.080]  Anyway, we're gonna die. Divided by velocity equals...
[10:56.260 --> 10:58.280]  Try to crack a hole in that mountain? Yeah, I'm trying.
[10:58.820 --> 11:00.520]  Should we have a race down the mountain from the top?
[11:01.160 --> 11:01.480]  No.
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.260]  I'll get out and I'll jump. We gotta do a job. We got a job. We got a job to do?
[11:06.820 --> 11:12.280]  We got a job to do. Okay, now Gavin, start going down. Does it pay? Because I got a bunch of girlfriends in this game now.
[11:12.300 --> 11:16.720]  It pays. Oh boy. Okay, that works. Let's go. Everybody out. Wait, hang on. What happened? He's going down to the sea.
[11:17.240 --> 11:18.940]  Wait, wait, why am I... wait.
[11:20.860 --> 11:24.920]  Why do you want us? Wait, to what? Uh, follow me into the town?
[11:26.020 --> 11:28.240]  Wherever you bloody well please.
[11:28.720 --> 11:29.320]  The purple dot.
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.920]  Go to the purple dot. Purple dot. Got it. That's the name of the other... that's the name of the next strip club, Eric.
[11:36.500 --> 11:40.100]  Ah, I'm on my way. I'm on my way. It was a ruse. No!
[11:40.620 --> 11:46.800]  Oh, no. Okay, not quite the purple dot. I'm moving the purple dot. Where? Where's the...
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.340]  There we go. That's where the purple dot... that's where you should go. Okay, I'm there.
[11:53.540 --> 11:55.940]  Oh, fuck. Oh, no, I just saw that.
[11:56.720 --> 11:57.440]  What happened?
[11:58.900 --> 12:03.400]  Oh, I hit the fence. Yeah, you did. Uh, Gavin, you want to join up on my organization?
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.340]  Nick just swat his face on a chain link fence. Oh, did you see it? Did you see it? Yeah, that was awesome.
[12:13.460 --> 12:13.820]  Clotheslined.
[12:17.080 --> 12:18.720]  That was awesome. Join the organization!
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.200]  Where's that? In my phone?
[12:22.060 --> 12:26.860]  Should be. Oh, continue data breaches. Ow, ow, ow, ow. I don't have a...
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.240]  I don't have a... Hire associates, offer to friends.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.920]  There are no... you gotta leave your association.
[12:34.860 --> 12:37.080]  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.540]  Nick, I want you so bad. Okay, he's left. Okay. Oh, it's so tempting. Oh, action roll, shoot him!
[12:43.540 --> 12:44.200]  Associates?
[12:46.260 --> 12:48.840]  He's hiding behind the CEO. Which one do I shoot?
[12:50.080 --> 12:52.980]  Which one's the real one? Not the CEO. Okay, follow me.
[12:53.560 --> 12:56.980]  Not, not the... We got a job. We got criminals to deal with. Oh, we do?
[12:57.860 --> 12:58.220]  Yeah.
[12:59.340 --> 13:02.040]  Give me that. Oh god. Oh, Gavin, I heard that.
[13:02.580 --> 13:04.120]  Jeez, you son of a bitch.
[13:04.780 --> 13:10.020]  Wait, how are we? Wait, how do we get back up here? Wait, Andrew, where are you going? Just follow through me. Follow me.
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.420]  I'm the only one following you. I'm the only one following you in this organization. We're right behind you.
[13:14.420 --> 13:18.600]  Oh, a cat. You're doing great. Oh, there's a cat. I'm like seven feet behind you. Yeah.
[13:19.080 --> 13:24.640]  And he got hit by a car. Yeah, that's pretty cool. We're bottom dollar bail enforcement. Bail enforcement.
[13:25.540 --> 13:29.240]  We gotta go get some fucking criminals. Hell yeah. We're just doing a...
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.680]  like a bounty hunt? What are we doing? Yeah, we gotta do a mission because we got away for the call. Lester's not calling me,
[13:34.760 --> 13:37.960]  so we gotta do a mission. If we were just gonna spend time
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.820]  not doing a heist, I could be at the Vanilla Unicorn right now. We know.
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.240]  The Vanilla Shoe?
[13:45.500 --> 13:48.760]  I've been hearing good things from Nick about the feet stuff.
[13:49.660 --> 13:50.580]  Who's this woman?
[13:52.160 --> 13:53.020]  Oh, here's...
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.340]  She's the secretary. Listen, I'm logging into my bail thing. We're gonna start a mission. We're gonna go get a guy.
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.480]  Do you own this building? Yeah. Nice.
[14:01.560 --> 14:04.720]  We're gonna go get Brock Thompson. Can we sit on the couch?
[14:05.580 --> 14:05.740]  No.
[14:06.680 --> 14:09.120]  There's something that's kicking over here. What is it? Is it eat snacks?
[14:09.920 --> 14:12.080]  Yeah. Oh, my snacks are full. I'm full of snacks.
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.080]  Yeah, grab some snacks.
[14:14.700 --> 14:16.360]  Where's the snack? Oh, dude, an iPod dock.
[14:18.160 --> 14:19.920]  Uh, remember when this came out, please?
[14:20.980 --> 14:27.000]  Okay, we gotta secure this guy. We need to get Brock Thompson. Hey, where the hell'd you go?
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.540]  We're loading in. We are? Do we have to leave? Oh, we're getting Rock Lobster.
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.080]  Rock Lobster!
[14:37.340 --> 14:41.860]  Whoa, down, down, down. All right, let's do it.
[14:43.240 --> 14:44.640]  What the? All right.
[14:47.500 --> 14:51.600]  So, are we bringing him in or killing him? No, we gotta bring him in. Don't kill him.
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.420]  Oh, man. Do we have, like, lassos? Are we cowboys? Yeah, do we have a rope? Yeah. I don't know. We'll figure it out.
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.480]  I don't have a lot of faith in the CEO. You don't often hear, I don't know, from the top.
[15:02.720 --> 15:04.380]  Yeah, man, I don't know. Break his legs.
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.820]  Actually, I feel like I heard that quite a lot. You do. You'd be surprised so often.
[15:11.320 --> 15:12.140]  Okay. Get in!
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.840]  It's locked. So...
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.300]  I guess, we have to take another car. All right. Oh, you gotta hang on, hang on to the side, Nick, Nick, Nick!
[15:23.620 --> 15:28.980]  This way, Nick. Let's go! Okay, we gotta go take out the signal jammers.
[15:30.520 --> 15:33.620]  Oh, we're gonna die. We are going to die. Oh my god.
[15:34.380 --> 15:36.660]  All right, hang on. I'll put a, uh...
[15:37.560 --> 15:40.780]  Thank you. Oh my god, these are so far.
[15:41.420 --> 15:45.080]  Good lord. Yeah, you will be fine. Why did we start all the way up here?
[15:45.860 --> 15:51.100]  Because it's the cheapest one. Holy shit. It's not cheap when it comes to time.
[15:52.360 --> 15:53.960]  Better eat time... Jesus!
[15:56.080 --> 15:58.000]  What happened to him? I hit it!
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.780]  What? He hit the sign? The sign did its job.
[16:03.980 --> 16:07.240]  I did stop and I lost all my armor. Let me get some back.
[16:08.260 --> 16:12.020]  All right. Oh, wait. The weapon wheel, apparently, we can access armor.
[16:12.700 --> 16:17.620]  That's cool that you can hold on to the side. That's awesome. Yeah, it's great. It's not cool when it rolls. Yep. Yeah.
[16:20.020 --> 16:22.100]  I'd argue it's still pretty cool as the driver.
[16:24.940 --> 16:29.580]  I'd like to believe that I'd be hugged up against this vehicle a bit more if I was on the side.
[16:29.580 --> 16:29.940]  Oh!
[16:32.420 --> 16:33.040]  Light show!
[16:35.420 --> 16:39.880]  Where's the question mark in relation to the other stuff? I don't know. I'm looking. I don't see it.
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.120]  Oh, oh, it's way down. We can do all the jammers and then go to the question mark. It is
[16:45.580 --> 16:46.700]  way down there, dude.
[16:48.180 --> 16:50.280]  We started northwest. Everything's
[16:51.420 --> 16:51.860]  southeast.
[16:53.200 --> 16:56.680]  I'm surprised I could hold this gun with one hand. You're pretty strong.
[16:57.680 --> 16:58.840]  Yeah, you get a good grip.
[17:00.760 --> 17:02.840]  This guy's probably getting a bit pissed off.
[17:03.300 --> 17:06.000]  Pissed off? Oh! Oh!
[17:06.380 --> 17:10.600]  Yeah, I'd say they look pissed. I don't think they're alive. Oh! Oh!
[17:11.380 --> 17:14.360]  Okay, well. Well, it turns out they're not. No longer pissed.
[17:15.900 --> 17:19.140]  Squad! You're not supposed to go to sleep angry, and he did, permanently.
[17:20.780 --> 17:21.180]  Permanently.
[17:23.860 --> 17:24.960]  Don't die angry.
[17:27.300 --> 17:28.500]  They always do that.
[17:28.500 --> 17:30.880]  Nick! Nick, what the hell?
[17:31.680 --> 17:34.460]  He shot the guy in the heart and swerved into him.
[17:35.860 --> 17:37.060]  I had that coming.
[17:38.680 --> 17:43.740]  Yeah, he did. That AI acted appropriately. That was great work by that AI.
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.600]  Oh, hit the jump and land in the in the army base, and then we can fly. No. No? Oh, yeah.
[17:53.420 --> 17:58.740]  We could just fly there. The camera just changed, and I'm just staring at Nick's shoes. I don't know why.
[17:59.400 --> 18:00.760]  Uh-oh. Nick! Oh, no!
[18:01.480 --> 18:02.660]  Oh my god.
[18:04.800 --> 18:08.240]  I saw the rat just shake its head. It's so much more stressful if you do two on the sides. Yeah, not feeling good.
[18:09.380 --> 18:10.300]  I just leveled up.
[18:11.580 --> 18:11.940]  Nice!
[18:12.400 --> 18:17.580]  Cruising with friends. Get more health. Yeah, it just said like CEO proximity bonus and all that stuff. Hey, Nick,
[18:17.640 --> 18:19.140]  there might be a guy behind you who's pretty pissed.
[18:19.780 --> 18:24.760]  Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Hey, bud. He's not there anymore.
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.980]  Oh, Gavin! Oh, Gavin!
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.880]  That was atrocious!
[18:35.980 --> 18:36.500]  Sorry.
[18:37.500 --> 18:38.600]  I'm just curious.
[18:40.460 --> 18:43.480]  Oh, Gavin! Oh, fuck. Sorry.
[18:46.100 --> 18:47.300]  Get back on.
[18:49.360 --> 18:52.580]  Sorry about that. I got you covered, Gavin. No, no, that's mine.
[18:54.860 --> 18:56.500]  No, that's it. That's mine.
[18:57.480 --> 18:58.580]  I'm trying to grab on.
[19:00.140 --> 19:04.900]  No, that's mine. No, that's mine! All right, let's do it, Gavin!
[19:05.660 --> 19:06.520]  Grab on. Wait!
[19:07.340 --> 19:07.740]  Wait.
[19:08.920 --> 19:11.880]  Wait, you gotta- I'm not gonna try to fucking take it. Just let me on.
[19:12.700 --> 19:17.380]  There. Okay, good. All right, Gavin, we're on our way. Let's do this thing. Let's do it!
[19:17.380 --> 19:23.640]  Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba! Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba! Hey, we're really close to that. I was gonna say that was very close.
[19:25.980 --> 19:27.500]  You can get pretty close to stuff.
[19:27.660 --> 19:34.700]  That is terrifying. Yeah! Oh, the sign!
[19:37.460 --> 19:38.540]  Out of the way, prick!
[19:39.500 --> 19:42.780]  This is the most psychopath mission we've ever done.
[19:43.640 --> 19:46.600]  Nothing is happening. Two people are hanging off a van.
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.900]  No! Gavin!
[19:49.960 --> 19:53.380]  Oh, you got me on the phone pool! Come on, Andrew, hang on!
[19:56.820 --> 19:58.100]  Oh, Gavin! Oh, Nick!
[19:59.460 --> 20:02.380]  Hey, you almost went over that, buddy.
[20:06.500 --> 20:08.220]  All right, let's try and find a jump.
[20:11.440 --> 20:16.140]  Hey, Andrew, why'd you give up your seat in the drive? I didn't give it up, Nick!
[20:16.640 --> 20:17.680]  You're not in it!
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.360]  You gave up your seat!
[20:22.920 --> 20:27.200]  I mean, technically, before that, my seat got given up by a couple of signs. Oh, man.
[20:27.900 --> 20:28.620]  Oh, no!
[20:29.760 --> 20:32.300]  Stop doing it! All right, Gavin, that wasn't your fault.
[20:33.980 --> 20:35.640]  Hey, I'll take responsibility on that one.
[20:36.660 --> 20:42.040]  Oh, you tried to clip that. I was close on the mailbox. Yeah, I'm gonna go to sleep angry at this rate.
[20:43.440 --> 20:45.240]  As long as you don't die angry.
[20:46.560 --> 20:48.300]  Ugh. No, just drive angry.
[20:50.360 --> 20:52.660]  I wanted that movie to be so good. Absolutely!
[20:56.100 --> 20:56.520]  Gavin.
[20:57.420 --> 21:03.320]  Oh, that was awesome. I had such a good shot of that. I didn't think that you would, uh, that's such a low fence.
[21:04.260 --> 21:05.000]  That's my bad.
[21:08.060 --> 21:08.900]  All right, thank you.
[21:10.220 --> 21:16.360]  What? Yeah, it's such a low fence. Look at how freaking high my legs are versus the fence. Good point.
[21:16.900 --> 21:17.880]  Very good point.
[21:23.150 --> 21:23.910]  Oh, God.
[21:25.530 --> 21:27.730]  Yeah, we're almost there. How's this thing handle?
[21:29.150 --> 21:31.110]  It's pretty slow moving.
[21:31.690 --> 21:33.470]  How's this thing handle?
[21:37.070 --> 21:39.710]  Well, I'll never know. What's the horsepower under that hood there, bud?
[21:39.710 --> 21:44.830]  Gavin! Oh, Gavin. Oh, Gavin. Oh, Gavin.
[21:44.970 --> 21:48.070]  I just asked you a question. You killed me for it.
[21:50.470 --> 21:54.310]  Okay, here comes Nick. Here comes Nick.
[21:56.890 --> 21:59.870]  All right, there's blood all over that step on your side.
[22:01.810 --> 22:05.330]  Are we getting closer to these freaking things yet? Yes. Yeah. Are they moving?
[22:05.570 --> 22:08.250]  We would have been there if you didn't slam into every wall.
[22:08.730 --> 22:10.270]  Do you not have the waypoint?
[22:10.810 --> 22:13.910]  It moved. Yeah, but they're on the very edge of my mini-map. I can't tell how far away they are.
[22:13.990 --> 22:18.110]  Yeah, we're getting there. You're gonna keep going. You're gonna cut up into the city and then...
[22:19.710 --> 22:26.570]  Gavin. Nick was about to die and I made a little correction. There you go. Way to go. Nick was about to die mad.
[22:29.510 --> 22:35.810]  Oh, boy. Oh, trees. You have me to consider things you never did before, huh?
[22:38.530 --> 22:42.290]  Can I knock you off on a person, do you think? Oh, try it. Try it. I want to see it.
[22:42.810 --> 22:44.470]  Try it. I want to see that experiment.
[22:45.870 --> 22:51.090]  All right, when I see someone. Okay. You gotta hang a left here. Oh, God. There you go.
[22:52.310 --> 22:58.150]  And streets are empty as soon as you said that. Everyone went into hiding. Well, everyone knew we were coming. Yeah.
[22:58.730 --> 23:03.850]  Maybe a cyclist. We should try a motorcyclist. Oh, that was close. Oh, there we go. Here we go.
[23:04.750 --> 23:05.230]  You missed.
[23:08.630 --> 23:11.010]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[23:13.210 --> 23:17.650]  I'm pretty sure Nick got run over in the air. No, it bounced over me somehow.
[23:18.570 --> 23:22.450]  Oh, that was crazy. Wow, that was awesome. Well, we're almost to point A.
[23:23.690 --> 23:24.550]  There we go.
[23:26.230 --> 23:28.290]  Nope. Oh, there's the sign now.
[23:30.810 --> 23:32.290]  Stay there. Wait your turn.
[23:36.790 --> 23:37.190]  Oh
[23:37.190 --> 23:38.270]  Where the hell are we going?
[23:39.010 --> 23:45.890]  Where are you taking us? I'm following the line. Do you don't see it? Yeah, but what kind of piece of shit GPS is this?
[23:46.710 --> 23:51.970]  Oh, he did it. Okay, so if you hit a person with the person on the side, they fall off. Yeah.
[23:52.050 --> 23:56.130]  Oh, he's dead. You killed that guy. You killed that guy with your body. Yeah.
[23:56.930 --> 23:58.290]  I'm not hurt that bad either.
[23:59.030 --> 24:02.270]  So is this like an in-between heist video? Is that what we're doing?
[24:02.290 --> 24:03.990]  In-between. In-between the heists.
[24:04.830 --> 24:11.290]  Yeah, I figured it would take maybe 10 minutes. Uh-huh. And then that's just the driving. Yeah. Well, uh,
[24:11.910 --> 24:12.930]  uncertain people are driving.
[24:16.270 --> 24:18.750]  I mean, what's going on?
[24:19.970 --> 24:24.370]  I was trying not to get hit and I slowed down real real good.
[24:25.350 --> 24:27.570]  Man, I wasted a lot of ammo on this drive.
[24:28.610 --> 24:30.910]  I've wasted a lot of health. You're dead. Yep. Oh.
[24:32.430 --> 24:34.190]  Oh boy. Is it really down here?
[24:36.250 --> 24:36.930]  Oh, this is-
[24:40.310 --> 24:42.730]  Watching Nick fucking die.
[24:45.510 --> 24:51.670]  It's the most- I'm so angry and I want to just blow up this vehicle so much that that would end it.
[24:52.750 --> 25:01.410]  You said it's on a journey with a car with two seats. I said it's on a journey that you took over and drove the wrong way.
[25:01.410 --> 25:03.310]  I was getting taken advantage of.
[25:04.310 --> 25:05.850]  I was getting walked all over.
[25:06.270 --> 25:10.630]  I tested one thing. Get out of the heist! Don't forget the heist. Oh my god.
[25:12.150 --> 25:13.050]  All right, it was up here.
[25:14.650 --> 25:19.230]  Oh, were we supposed to kill him? Uh, yeah. Oh god. Yeah. Okay, coming around.
[25:20.770 --> 25:24.450]  Oh, please don't go into the water. Not going. Why'd you go this way?
[25:25.050 --> 25:26.510]  Because that's how the hell else would I get up there.
[25:27.250 --> 25:28.650]  Wow, this really was tucked away.
[25:29.270 --> 25:33.490]  Uh, what do we do here? Oh, destroy it. We killed it. We got the signal jammer. All right, next one.
[25:34.190 --> 25:36.930]  Mark me the next one. I gotcha. Boom, walked in.
[25:37.790 --> 25:40.470]  Okay. Nice job, fellas. Into the water we go.
[25:40.610 --> 25:45.130]  Oh, the thing switched. Well, what's it doing?
[25:51.530 --> 25:53.570]  Because you kept going back and forth.
[25:59.430 --> 26:05.970]  Andrew died. Wait, really? That was the one life we had. We have team lives. It just occurred to us.
[26:06.950 --> 26:13.490]  I'm gonna go ahead and bomb him. I knew we had team lives. I didn't. Yeah, it occurred to us as maybe a strong statement. Yes.
[26:14.210 --> 26:16.290]  All right, Andrew, are you still there? No!
[26:17.030 --> 26:22.990]  You're not, you're not around? Let him get his own vehicle to us. Don't. Gavin, I know what you're thinking. I...
[26:22.990 --> 26:24.950]  Gavin. Well, he's gonna go get him. It's gonna help him out.
[26:25.430 --> 26:26.490]  Keep going. Keep going straight.
[26:28.590 --> 26:30.030]  Andrew, do you have armor?
[26:32.370 --> 26:33.790]  Please put your armor on.
[26:35.450 --> 26:40.210]  Stick to the road. Yeah, dude, I'm leveling up and making money. I'm living right now.
[26:40.410 --> 26:47.530]  If this is how money really worked where I just rode around with someone driving and here they hand me a thousand dollars, I'd be stoked.
[26:48.670 --> 26:50.550]  Also gain life experience. Great.
[26:52.110 --> 26:53.070]  Life experience.
[26:53.510 --> 26:56.030]  I assume that's the equivalent here. This going on your resume, Nick?
[26:56.410 --> 27:02.110]  Oh, yeah, definitely. This is a number one experience. He's still gonna list college on there, but this is going on there. Yeah.
[27:03.170 --> 27:05.810]  Van cruising. College radio. Can't take it off.
[27:11.370 --> 27:13.210]  Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[27:15.310 --> 27:16.570]  That was real good.
[27:19.390 --> 27:20.570]  Okay, we gotta keep going.
[27:21.610 --> 27:27.830]  Does the bounty value change based on how hurt he gets or something? Dude, I have no idea. If we kill him we get less.
[27:28.230 --> 27:34.650]  Ah, got it. Ah, all right. But not nothing. No headshots. But way less. Way less. Oh god, that's tight.
[27:40.070 --> 27:45.510]  Sorry guys, that was real tight. Stop moving the cart. You're gonna run them over. Yeah, I've been hit several times that way.
[27:45.590 --> 27:48.010]  Look at the blood on his ankle. You could have just hit one of us.
[27:48.610 --> 27:53.950]  The fact that you got both of us is impressive. Is this an intimidation factor? Oh shit, we gotta kill these guys!
[27:56.710 --> 27:58.930]  Ah, oh damn it!
[27:59.670 --> 28:02.010]  We're killing them. You killed me!
[28:03.290 --> 28:08.610]  Oh. Nick died, Andrew died. Guess who's gonna have to drive from the beacon? Oh wait, no, it's just done.
[28:09.730 --> 28:16.330]  Never mind. Wait, it's done? Yeah, it's over. We have lives now. I'm still doing it. No, it's done!
[28:16.810 --> 28:20.510]  Bounty over. No chance at the money. It says open the door.
[28:21.630 --> 28:27.790]  Did we kill the guy? Oh, I'm dead. I'm just out. You've just eliminated me from playing. And me! And we lost. I'm out.
[28:30.570 --> 28:34.830]  Mission failed. Well, that was our one chance of doing that.
[28:37.090 --> 28:40.390]  Good job team! I made a bunch of money just cruising around. I almost leveled up again, dude.
[28:41.010 --> 28:46.810]  I'm confused as to why we were doing that. Because we- oh my god. Did you go to quit job or restart?
[28:46.950 --> 28:48.190]  Please don't tell me you went to restart.
[28:48.190 --> 28:53.650]  I think I hit restart instinctually because Gavin- NOOOOOO!
[28:59.630 --> 29:06.150]  I'm just gonna take a secondary vehicle this time. Yeah, that's fine. We can surely just do the heist.
[29:07.090 --> 29:13.370]  We can't do the heist! You fucking fool! We've been over this! I need a call from Lester!
[29:13.370 --> 29:20.290]  I don't have a call from Lester! And someone said do an activity, so I load up an activity, and you're just like-
[29:20.290 --> 29:26.030]  I can't hear you! I can't hear you! I'm talking over you! I can't hear you!
[29:28.270 --> 29:34.150]  Oh, a pup and a hydrant.
[29:44.910 --> 29:50.830]  You launched so high! That was awesome! I've never been so high on a hydrant!
[29:52.790 --> 29:56.030]  Oh my god. Oh my god, that was the funniest shit in the world.
[29:57.910 --> 30:00.490]  Alright, I'm going to D. Everybody should just go to their own.
[30:01.350 --> 30:05.310]  Yeah, we actually- just remember we don't actually need to drive that. We can drive whatever we want.
[30:07.230 --> 30:09.730]  Are you sure? Do we not have to arrest him in that? Yep, positive.
[30:10.230 --> 30:15.770]  Alright, Nick, do you have my waypoint on your map? I do. What if I just start the heist?
[30:16.550 --> 30:18.590]  What if we just do this mission real quick?
[30:19.050 --> 30:24.910]  Why don't we do it real quick? We're already 20 minutes into this video!
[30:33.530 --> 30:36.710]  Why didn't you say that? I don't know what you're doing!
[30:39.420 --> 30:42.960]  Why didn't you say that? Say what? What happened? It's all documented!
[30:43.440 --> 30:45.200]  Oh, I'm having a good time. It's all in the tape!
[30:45.720 --> 30:48.880]  I said we got to do an activity and then he'll do it. Yeah, check the tape.
[30:49.220 --> 30:52.680]  I don't think I ever heard you say we got to do an activity. I heard him say it.
[30:52.680 --> 30:53.780]  You just all of a sudden- I said it!
[30:54.080 --> 30:56.340]  All of a sudden you're in a bail bonds thing. He said it.
[30:56.340 --> 31:03.340]  I was having a great time at Vanilla Unicorn. I told you I needed to make some money. Drop the clip!
[31:03.860 --> 31:05.360]  It says, uh...
[31:05.360 --> 31:09.860]  Doing a job. We'll get Lester to call us. I'm taking us to a thing where we can do a quick job.
[31:10.320 --> 31:13.220]  That's great. You just had vagina in your ears. Come on.
[31:16.160 --> 31:17.920]  I only liked their first album.
[31:20.860 --> 31:25.940]  Too far? No. Far Enough was their first album.
[31:28.220 --> 31:29.520]  Hence why it sucked.
[31:30.360 --> 31:31.140]  Oh, yes.
[31:32.740 --> 31:35.660]  Is there an album called Far Enough? It has to be.
[31:36.860 --> 31:38.220]  Where's Geoff when you need him? He'd know.
[31:39.220 --> 31:39.660]  He would.
[31:40.820 --> 31:44.400]  We're playing GTA, so Geoff must be out of town. Should we go get a jet?
[31:46.400 --> 31:48.120]  Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's do it.
[31:49.340 --> 31:52.640]  I mean this would be over if we got the jet the first time. Well, we're getting it now.
[31:55.020 --> 31:56.660]  If I remember how to do it. We never started it.
[31:58.520 --> 32:06.740]  Oh, what? Oh, Nick, that was so sick. I haven't forgotten how to get a jet. Nick, that was awesome.
[32:07.080 --> 32:12.980]  Thanks, man. Did you go straight over? Oh, yeah. Oh, dude, he did like a spin move. That was so sick.
[32:13.120 --> 32:14.220]  Where the hell are the planes?
[32:14.960 --> 32:18.560]  Up here to the left. Oh, are they? By the runway? Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
[32:19.680 --> 32:23.440]  I think they're right here, left. See? Oh, yeah, perfect. Wow.
[32:23.940 --> 32:29.420]  Are these two people in the jet or one people in the jet? You take that one. I'll find another one. The one?
[32:29.600 --> 32:32.180]  Oh, there's another one. Yeah, there's one right there. I see it.
[32:33.900 --> 32:34.560]  See you soon.
[32:41.440 --> 32:44.160]  It sounded oddly threatening, didn't it?
[32:46.840 --> 32:47.960]  These aren't jump jets, right?
[32:53.840 --> 32:54.160]  Oh
[32:54.160 --> 32:59.180]  Eric took off from the park spot. Oh, you know what? You can't just do that.
[33:01.120 --> 33:03.420]  I'm so mad that animals are in the game
[33:07.080 --> 33:11.580]  When what? Well, I just wish animals were in the game the whole time. Yeah
[33:13.760 --> 33:16.760]  Did he's not how do you how do you shoot missiles hit x
[33:17.520 --> 33:21.220]  Oh, then press y god, oh no us
[33:22.160 --> 33:24.000]  Okay, we're out of lives. Yep
[33:25.240 --> 33:28.480]  Well, the good news is if one of us dies the rest of us can keep going
[33:30.740 --> 33:33.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[33:35.720 --> 33:40.280]  Yep, how you doing over there gavin? I don't know where I am. Am I near them?
[33:41.240 --> 33:43.900]  Am I in? You've played this game so much. How are you?
[33:44.940 --> 33:45.340]  Oh, i'm not
[33:46.180 --> 33:50.140]  I just was trying to get into the military base and I you sound like everyone online nick. Come on
[33:51.600 --> 33:53.040]  Oh, you played this a lot
[33:53.900 --> 33:56.160]  I'm gonna go to the question mark. I want to see what that is
[33:56.620 --> 33:57.420]  It's a good idea
[33:58.020 --> 34:01.740]  I just saw a jet fly over doing something a lot doesn't mean you're good at it
[34:02.380 --> 34:03.060]  bombs away
[34:04.440 --> 34:08.260]  That one I eat a lot of food. It doesn't mean I don't bite the inside of my own mouth
[34:08.680 --> 34:12.180]  Yeah, it doesn't mean i've never clamped down on a on a fork before
[34:16.220 --> 34:21.800]  Yes, it feels pretty humiliating when you bite a fork and you think it's probably the millionth time a fork was in my mouth
[34:23.640 --> 34:30.460]  Remember when I put the harrier jet in the ocean that was fun. That was great trying to pick up gavin. Yeah
[34:37.000 --> 34:37.440]  Convoy
[34:43.760 --> 34:46.380]  You okay nick I crashed my jet
[34:47.860 --> 34:48.600]  No

[36:17.060 --> 36:17.940]  it probably
[36:18.720 --> 36:24.020]  Destroys the things a lot faster. You probably just fire at it and it immediately breaks the jammer, you know
[36:24.020 --> 36:25.800]  It blows them up really fast a jet
[36:26.480 --> 36:28.120]  I also got the insurgent

[40:57.720 --> 41:03.880]  Like except for the beginning I really like this the beginning is a wild drive

[41:58.840 --> 42:01.720]  There you go, that was what the third album was called
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.080]  I'm curious if we'll all get 121 000 or if it will divvy it up between the forks
[42:08.440 --> 42:10.900]  Oh good question, or if it's only for the survivors
[42:11.540 --> 42:14.300]  Yeah, I was gonna say I don't think me and gavin are about to get any of this money
[42:15.080 --> 42:17.000]  I'd be mad if I don't

[42:31.760 --> 42:35.960]  Oh what I really hope it was a coyote and not a dog. Did you hit it?
[42:36.740 --> 42:38.960]  Yeah, I did. I certainly felt it
[42:39.660 --> 42:42.800]  It went what it went I mean, isn't it a coyote a dog
[42:43.440 --> 42:45.560]  It's a no canine. It's a coyote
[42:46.540 --> 42:51.020]  Kind of dog ish a cane. It is dog ish, but I would say they're very different things
[42:51.020 --> 42:53.320]  Where do dogs come from? Is it a wolf or a coyote?
[42:54.040 --> 42:55.960]  I think a wolf right? They made it ireland
[42:56.560 --> 42:57.320]  Yeah, it's a wolf
[43:01.820 --> 43:02.380]  Out of the way
[43:03.380 --> 43:06.460]  Oh my god, that is the exact opposite of out of the way
[43:07.780 --> 43:09.660]  Oh who would have predicted they would have gone that way
[43:10.420 --> 43:15.100]  Oh here they come they're on your tail they're on you again, they're in front front front of us
