[00:00.000 --> 00:02.520]  You look like you're made of mushy peas.
[00:03.300 --> 00:05.240]  Oh, I'll show you who I am. I made a character.
[00:05.460 --> 00:06.880]  I'll show you who I am.
[00:07.140 --> 00:08.220]  Not wearing a helmet, dude.
[00:09.160 --> 00:10.280]  Why would I need a helmet?
[00:10.780 --> 00:13.440]  Armor. Holy shit, you've done so much more than I have.
[00:13.640 --> 00:14.980]  Wait, Geoff. Yeah?
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.800]  Did we pick the same nose?
[00:17.660 --> 00:18.660]  Yes. Oh, for God's sake.
[00:18.780 --> 00:19.400]  Yes, we did.
[00:24.320 --> 00:26.260]  And we have the same pants on.
[00:27.880 --> 00:28.580]  You guys are twins.
[00:29.120 --> 00:30.200]  You guys are so matchy.
[00:30.520 --> 00:31.800]  How do you keep doing that?
[00:31.940 --> 00:34.440]  Hello, and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:34.540 --> 00:38.660]  First of all, thank you so much to Xbox and Stoic for giving us early access to Towerborn.
[00:39.580 --> 00:40.540]  I'm liking it a lot.
[00:41.060 --> 00:41.840]  Yeah, it's pretty fun.
[00:42.240 --> 00:44.600]  This is so my speed of video game, it's crazy.
[00:44.780 --> 00:46.580]  Like, when you're like, hey, let's play this.
[00:46.620 --> 00:47.440]  I went, eh, we'll see.
[00:47.900 --> 00:51.880]  And then it is just keep walking and fighting these things.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.160]  They're little gobbling gremlins.
[00:53.380 --> 00:54.760]  I can't get enough of it.
[00:54.760 --> 00:56.300]  I've been playing it all morning. I love it.
[00:56.460 --> 00:59.460]  I love a video game that's like, no, you can't go backwards.
[00:59.580 --> 01:01.160]  There's nothing back there for you.
[01:01.160 --> 01:02.980]  Just keep going forward. Don't pick up a ton of stuff.
[01:03.040 --> 01:05.080]  Okay, let's start with an easy one here.
[01:05.460 --> 01:07.760]  We're just gonna jump into a regular one.
[01:07.880 --> 01:09.820]  This is just the Biome of Grasslands.
[01:10.200 --> 01:10.520]  Classic.
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.420]  Here's all of us.
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.820]  I'm attempting to start a mission.
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.860]  Okay, just gotta ready it up.
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.540]  I'm readyin'.
[01:18.540 --> 01:20.520]  Oh, dude, so ready.
[01:21.500 --> 01:22.480]  Why wouldn't it do it?
[01:23.140 --> 01:24.900]  Recommended gear score 5.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.080]  What's everybody's gear score?
[01:26.620 --> 01:27.960]  I think mine might be 1.
[01:29.360 --> 01:31.920]  Nick, what's your gear score?
[01:33.040 --> 01:33.440]  Zero.
[01:34.780 --> 01:36.020]  Oh, well, we're in better shape than Nick.
[01:36.340 --> 01:38.060]  Oh, look at how cool we look together.
[01:38.180 --> 01:39.440]  We're like little adventurers.
[01:39.540 --> 01:42.420]  He's got giant fists. Let's make a pose.
[01:42.720 --> 01:44.380]  Yeah, I just put my big fists on.
[01:44.580 --> 01:45.620]  Look, I haven't used it yet.
[01:46.000 --> 01:47.120]  How do I get fists?
[01:47.780 --> 01:49.420]  Oh, it's your different...
[01:49.420 --> 01:51.680]  Yeah, it's your different...
[01:51.680 --> 01:52.500]  I'm having a seat.
[01:53.300 --> 01:55.140]  I'm just gonna have a little sit down.
[01:55.460 --> 01:57.500]  Guys, I made the classic
[01:58.580 --> 01:59.300]  fighting scamp
[01:59.300 --> 01:59.900]  Bart Simpson.
[02:03.040 --> 02:05.240]  The pose you struck was a real Captain Ginyu, though.
[02:06.160 --> 02:07.400]  But now I'm having a seat.
[02:07.460 --> 02:08.040]  Are you guys ready?
[02:09.060 --> 02:11.660]  How do I run and cut the grass like Link?
[02:13.300 --> 02:14.060]  Get the rupees.
[02:16.140 --> 02:16.700]  Oh, man.
[02:17.140 --> 02:18.780]  Oh, I should turn on my sound.
[02:19.040 --> 02:19.880]  Oh, probably.
[02:21.780 --> 02:22.900]  I like having the big fit.
[02:22.980 --> 02:24.160]  It just feels like a beat-em-up.
[02:24.340 --> 02:26.000]  Like I'm truly in full beat-em-up mode.
[02:26.180 --> 02:28.140]  It's so nice to have fucking teammates
[02:28.140 --> 02:29.260]  and not have to do this all by myself.
[02:29.600 --> 02:31.220]  Oh, boy. It feels really different.
[02:31.720 --> 02:34.020]  Seeing more stuff on the screen that isn't just me
[02:34.020 --> 02:35.140]  fighting ten guys.
[02:36.020 --> 02:37.860]  Oh, that was sick, Gavin.
[02:37.940 --> 02:39.320]  It's like a colorful gauntlet.
[02:39.500 --> 02:42.140]  The secret to this game is don't be flanked.
[02:42.640 --> 02:44.500]  Yeah, definitely you want to
[02:44.500 --> 02:46.020]  evasive roll a lot
[02:46.020 --> 02:48.480]  and then as much as you can
[02:48.480 --> 02:50.320]  use your, uh, like
[02:50.320 --> 02:52.060]  magic and specials.
[02:52.500 --> 02:54.240]  They want you to use them.
[02:54.640 --> 02:55.700]  Yeah, and then also
[02:55.700 --> 02:58.200]  don't be afraid to use your little right trigger, Gavin.
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.080]  Oh, I like that they jump from off-screen.
[03:00.240 --> 03:02.420]  Oh, boy. Is that my floating pustule thing?
[03:02.540 --> 03:04.080]  Yeah, yeah. It fires a missile.
[03:04.720 --> 03:06.540]  He gets like a little refill charge.
[03:06.840 --> 03:08.360]  You get three of them, but then like they keep
[03:08.360 --> 03:09.580]  refilling. It's great.
[03:10.820 --> 03:12.500]  Also, I don't know this
[03:12.500 --> 03:14.480]  for sure, but I'm pretty sure this game is
[03:14.480 --> 03:16.520]  inspired by a lot of
[03:16.520 --> 03:18.420]  fighting games, because a lot of the special moves
[03:18.420 --> 03:20.380]  that the characters do look like
[03:20.380 --> 03:21.840]  King of Fighters special moves.
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.400]  Oh, really? Yeah, when I saw them, I'm like
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.040]  Oh, that's... Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck yeah.
[03:26.180 --> 03:28.600]  Well, it's definitely not
[03:28.600 --> 03:30.560]  inspired by non-fighting games.
[03:30.920 --> 03:31.200]  Yeah.
[03:32.900 --> 03:34.500]  I thought it was inspired by The Witness.
[03:35.460 --> 03:36.560]  You know those arcade games
[03:36.560 --> 03:38.400]  with the boxing, uh, ball?
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.600]  Whatever. I want to do... I didn't want to...
[03:41.040 --> 03:41.440]  Wow.
[03:43.140 --> 03:45.080]  Is that going to stay in the video?
[03:45.460 --> 03:45.720]  Yeah.
[03:46.980 --> 03:48.560]  Keep that flub in.
[03:49.020 --> 03:50.500]  I lost... I was trying to say
[03:50.500 --> 03:52.780]  speed bag, and I just couldn't find the word.
[03:52.980 --> 03:54.680]  What do you mean? I thought you had it.
[03:54.780 --> 03:56.900]  Boxing ball? Boxing ball
[03:56.900 --> 03:58.540]  is the official terminology. Yes.
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.700]  Um, I just want to hit one of those.
[04:00.800 --> 04:01.900]  I got my big Hulk hands.
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.620]  Geoff has a tremendous flub in this
[04:04.620 --> 04:06.360]  week's episode. Thank you. He does?
[04:06.600 --> 04:08.600]  He just stops altogether
[04:08.600 --> 04:10.120]  and starts again. Are we leaving that in?
[04:11.740 --> 04:12.440]  Uh, please.
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.540]  You gotta leave all flubs in.
[04:14.680 --> 04:16.500]  Nick didn't cut it, so I assume it's...
[04:16.500 --> 04:18.300]  Uh, I think we should cut it. What did I do?
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.660]  You, you, uh, it was right at the end
[04:20.660 --> 04:23.040]  of the episode, and you're, I think you're talking about Clutch by Pearls
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.700]  or something, and then you just lose the will to live
[04:24.700 --> 04:25.500]  halfway through the sentence.
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.800]  And then we just, we all just go quiet
[04:28.800 --> 04:30.660]  and you take it again, but it's like, it's a weird
[04:30.660 --> 04:32.620]  flub where it sounds like we were gonna
[04:32.620 --> 04:34.660]  cut it out. I don't think I was feeling
[04:34.660 --> 04:36.280]  well when we recorded that or something.
[04:36.280 --> 04:38.940]  I remember that. I think I was sick.
[04:39.420 --> 04:40.380]  Yeah. I would
[04:40.380 --> 04:42.360]  appreciate that it was cut, if it's not funny.
[04:42.460 --> 04:43.920]  Alright, I'll put that note in for Nick.
[04:43.940 --> 04:44.760]  There's no point to it.
[04:46.220 --> 04:48.120]  I mean, Nick's not playing the game, he can do it.
[04:48.280 --> 04:50.380]  If I went quiet, didn't make
[04:50.380 --> 04:52.420]  a joke, and then took another pass at it,
[04:52.460 --> 04:54.700]  I was definitely intending for it to be cut.
[04:57.880 --> 05:00.340]  Uh, the other thing
[05:00.340 --> 05:01.980]  that I figured out with this game,
[05:02.280 --> 05:04.260]  with, like, your left trigger
[05:04.780 --> 05:06.320]  specials or whatever, and then your right
[05:06.320 --> 05:08.240]  trigger, like, little guy, that
[05:08.240 --> 05:10.420]  right bumper move that, like,
[05:10.740 --> 05:12.180]  the different classes have
[05:12.180 --> 05:14.540]  is so useful
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.080]  for
[05:16.080 --> 05:18.560]  everyone. It, they're all different
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.140]  and fucking awesome.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.200]  Oh, what? How do you get a class?
[05:23.260 --> 05:24.480]  Uh, you can change
[05:24.480 --> 05:26.400]  it after this level. Go to school.
[05:27.140 --> 05:27.820]  You will all,
[05:28.040 --> 05:30.240]  the annoying thing is you have to level your classes
[05:30.240 --> 05:32.280]  individually though, so, like, you'll start
[05:32.280 --> 05:34.360]  at level one. I really
[05:34.360 --> 05:36.160]  like that, cause it's giving me a reason
[05:36.160 --> 05:38.300]  that this is my kind of game, cause I want
[05:38.300 --> 05:39.760]  the replayability of
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.400]  leveling this thing up from the beginning again.
[05:42.460 --> 05:44.220]  So that just adds to it for you. Oh, I fucking
[05:44.220 --> 05:46.220]  I love that shit. Dude, it's
[05:46.220 --> 05:48.440]  hard to see where I am sometimes.
[05:48.660 --> 05:50.540]  Very fucking castle crashers
[05:50.540 --> 05:52.260]  in that I think I'm fighting a dude, and then I
[05:52.260 --> 05:53.740]  realize I'm on the other side of the screen.
[05:54.080 --> 05:56.340]  Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm doing a good job
[05:56.340 --> 05:58.100]  or that I'm fighting a shrub.
[05:59.160 --> 06:00.360]  Yeah, but that shrub's really
[06:00.360 --> 06:02.380]  paying for it. Yeah, it's got
[06:02.380 --> 06:04.380]  money in it. Do you have to dodge with B, or
[06:04.380 --> 06:06.320]  can you just jump out of the way sometimes? You can
[06:06.320 --> 06:08.400]  jump out of the way sometimes, but you can do
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.820]  if you do a single B
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.360]  press, you can go up
[06:12.360 --> 06:14.540]  or down also. It doesn't have to be left or right.
[06:15.040 --> 06:15.720]  Oh, yeah. So that
[06:16.440 --> 06:18.100]  evasion up into, like, a corner
[06:18.100 --> 06:20.280]  really works. It is pretty
[06:20.280 --> 06:22.220]  good too, cause they don't really fight in those
[06:22.220 --> 06:24.400]  directions. They're pretty, uh... Yeah, they're pretty, well
[06:24.400 --> 06:26.280]  at least at, like, the level that we're
[06:26.280 --> 06:27.980]  at, these guys are pretty left and right.
[06:27.980 --> 06:29.480]  Um, which is
[06:29.480 --> 06:31.740]  good, cause if they're up and down, I'd be
[06:32.360 --> 06:33.540]  messed up early.
[06:34.460 --> 06:35.900]  I died so many
[06:35.900 --> 06:37.860]  times at the beginning of this game.
[06:39.480 --> 06:40.040]  I'd hate
[06:40.040 --> 06:41.300]  having to have a spiked tail
[06:41.740 --> 06:44.300]  in real life. What? Why? I would struggle.
[06:45.260 --> 06:45.980]  Really? I don't
[06:45.980 --> 06:48.020]  I think I'd sit on my tail all the time. I'd use it all the time. Dude, I
[06:48.020 --> 06:50.160]  would never be afraid of anything
[06:50.160 --> 06:52.080]  ever again. What about
[06:52.080 --> 06:54.100]  taking a dump, though? No way.
[06:54.560 --> 06:55.960]  Oh, man. Yeah, do you need, like,
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.900]  a tail rack to hang it on when you're
[06:57.900 --> 07:00.020]  shitting? A tail rack? What would I be
[07:00.020 --> 07:01.820]  afraid of? Taking a dump?
[07:01.940 --> 07:03.980]  Dude, that would rock. Shitting on your tail?
[07:04.100 --> 07:05.860]  Yeah. No, I'm not shitting on my tail.
[07:05.900 --> 07:07.840]  I'm lifting it. What are you, shit on your leg? What are you
[07:07.840 --> 07:09.020]  talking about? I'm dead again.
[07:09.840 --> 07:11.440]  I'm getting fucked up in this.
[07:12.700 --> 07:14.000]  I don't have any more lives.
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.840]  How do you deal with the tank? But my legs don't go in the
[07:15.840 --> 07:17.860]  bowl. Yeah. Why would
[07:17.860 --> 07:19.920]  your tail go in the bowl? Well, where do I
[07:19.920 --> 07:21.640]  put it while I'm sat? Yeah, where is it?
[07:21.760 --> 07:23.740]  On a toilet. Up above! What are you talking about?
[07:23.740 --> 07:25.200]  You turn and face the wall,
[07:25.200 --> 07:27.320]  and then you hit your tail
[07:27.720 --> 07:29.680]  hanging off the back. I don't know
[07:29.680 --> 07:31.000]  what you guys don't get.
[07:31.560 --> 07:32.680]  I want a tail rack.
[07:33.180 --> 07:35.700]  No, just turn and face the wall.
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.040]  What's the problem?
[07:38.260 --> 07:39.540]  Yeah, you have to hug the bowl.
[07:40.080 --> 07:41.240]  The top of the bowl.
[07:41.560 --> 07:42.660]  To me, it's a non-issue.
[07:43.260 --> 07:45.780]  Be sure to hit these boxes. They always have a little bit of loot in them.
[07:45.800 --> 07:47.080]  You get little things in it. There you go.
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.220]  Yeah. We got it.
[07:49.520 --> 07:50.960]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[07:50.960 --> 07:51.220]  No idea.
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.600]  Look at that.
[07:54.900 --> 07:56.260]  Oh, cool. A bunch of level 4 shit.
[07:56.380 --> 07:57.940]  I got hats!
[07:58.300 --> 07:59.740]  I got the fists.
[08:00.120 --> 08:01.180]  Check it out. I'm Bart Simpson.
[08:02.820 --> 08:03.600]  Oh, you are Bart Simpson.
[08:05.140 --> 08:06.040]  Oh, that's cool.
[08:06.200 --> 08:09.060]  So you get loot for classes you don't necessarily have.
[08:09.120 --> 08:11.060]  Return to B
[08:11.060 --> 08:12.100]  to hold B, right?
[08:12.640 --> 08:14.000]  You want to go back to the Belfry?
[08:14.680 --> 08:16.320]  No, X is Belfry.
[08:16.720 --> 08:17.880]  B is exit.
[08:17.880 --> 08:18.420]  Let's go back.
[08:18.840 --> 08:20.780]  What's the little floaty guy?
[08:21.240 --> 08:24.320]  He's your little dude who does magic spells with you.
[08:24.460 --> 08:26.560]  They have an Umbra, I think is the name.
[08:27.140 --> 08:27.280]  Yeah.
[08:27.840 --> 08:30.220]  And he just does a little thing with you.
[08:30.320 --> 08:32.120]  Gavin, if you press the start button
[08:32.120 --> 08:34.760]  and then hit right bumper to go to class,
[08:34.980 --> 08:36.540]  that's where you can change your class.
[08:37.140 --> 08:38.340]  Sentinel has a shield.
[08:39.300 --> 08:41.340]  Pyroclast has a big fire thing.
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.800]  Rockbreaker has fists.
[08:43.080 --> 08:45.120]  And Shadowstriker is mad.
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.580]  They're all pretty good.
[08:46.580 --> 08:47.960]  Sentinel is probably the most boring,
[08:48.260 --> 08:49.900]  but they're all pretty good.
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.200]  I will say, after you pick a class,
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.020]  then go to your loadout and go through everything.
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.480]  Yeah, you have to reapply everything.
[08:56.680 --> 08:57.520]  So you have different loads.
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.140]  It's class specific.
[08:59.400 --> 09:01.180]  I have the Pyro. I like it a lot.
[09:02.020 --> 09:02.800]  I do like it a lot.
[09:03.320 --> 09:06.360]  I will say, being able to wear a hat in a game
[09:06.360 --> 09:07.640]  is always a good feeling for me.
[09:07.880 --> 09:09.060]  It's nice to throw one on.
[09:09.220 --> 09:11.420]  Take advantage of it where you can.
[09:11.720 --> 09:13.860]  I picked my character's look
[09:14.580 --> 09:16.180]  specifically with his hair in mind
[09:16.180 --> 09:17.800]  and everything, and I don't want to wear a hat.
[09:17.900 --> 09:20.740]  So did I. I have the perfect kind of bald head
[09:20.740 --> 09:21.660]  and I can't see it.
[09:21.880 --> 09:23.920]  It looks like I've been scalped wearing this hat.
[09:27.920 --> 09:30.020]  Do we want to play another level
[09:30.020 --> 09:31.120]  so you guys can get a feel for it?
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.860]  Or do we want to go right into the Snaggleshire?
[09:33.440 --> 09:34.980]  Oh, let's snaggle it up.
[09:36.400 --> 09:37.240]  You guys ready to snaggle?
[09:37.620 --> 09:39.060]  Let's get some Snaggleshire going.
[09:39.100 --> 09:40.080]  Take your time.
[09:40.080 --> 09:42.060]  Guys, welcome to the Snaggleshire.
[09:42.280 --> 09:44.000]  A gobo army may be
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.560]  forming at Snaggleshire.
[09:45.660 --> 09:48.040]  Did that activate any sleeper cells in the audience?
[09:48.540 --> 09:50.140]  Rumors have surfaced of a
[09:50.140 --> 09:51.760]  gobo lieutenant in the area.
[09:52.280 --> 09:54.000]  When you said gobo, I was thinking
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.960]  of a bogo. I wanted to buy one
[09:55.960 --> 09:56.520]  and get one free.
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.440]  Are you going to gobo bogo?
[10:00.280 --> 10:00.960]  Gobo bogo!
[10:02.460 --> 10:03.840]  Yeah, I'm pretty bummed out
[10:03.840 --> 10:05.200]  about this hat, to be honest.
[10:05.660 --> 10:07.280]  You don't have to wear the hat.
[10:07.280 --> 10:08.660]  I mean, you probably should.
[10:08.900 --> 10:10.220]  Recommended gear score 16?
[10:12.320 --> 10:13.020]  Snaggleshire, guys,
[10:13.180 --> 10:15.060]  we might not do well in the Snaggleshire.
[10:15.520 --> 10:17.060]  I think we're going to get our ass kicked
[10:17.060 --> 10:19.400]  in the Snaggleshire. I think we've hit a snaggle.
[10:19.920 --> 10:21.340]  Damn it, you beat me to it,
[10:21.420 --> 10:22.420]  you son of a gun.
[10:24.240 --> 10:25.260]  Hey, watch your language.
[10:25.360 --> 10:26.200]  Don't son of a gun me.
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.200]  Do you get any flashbacks
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.020]  when you see that windmill?
[10:31.580 --> 10:33.260]  You go right into the windmill, come on.
[10:34.380 --> 10:35.420]  Okay, what does this guy say?
[10:35.420 --> 10:36.720]  We gotta talk.
[10:37.820 --> 10:39.500]  Send them back to where they came from,
[10:39.580 --> 10:40.400]  guys, let's go get them.
[10:42.160 --> 10:43.260]  I am struggling
[10:43.260 --> 10:44.340]  to kill the fence.
[10:44.840 --> 10:46.480]  I don't like my chances.
[10:47.260 --> 10:48.780]  I don't like my chances.
[10:49.420 --> 10:51.000]  Oh, Gavin, we're in trouble.
[10:51.920 --> 10:52.580]  Oh, no!
[10:53.180 --> 10:53.940]  Oh, fuck!
[10:55.920 --> 10:57.320]  Don't forget to use
[10:57.320 --> 10:59.240]  all your weapons, everything that you have.
[10:59.500 --> 11:01.160]  You have so many spells.
[11:02.380 --> 11:03.360]  Vary your combos,
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.740]  look out for bombs here.
[11:05.560 --> 11:07.100]  Yeah, if you can hit the bomb guy,
[11:07.200 --> 11:09.220]  when he's got a bomb in his hand, he'll drop it and it'll kill him.
[11:09.800 --> 11:11.320]  You just have to be far away
[11:11.320 --> 11:13.360]  from his bomb because he will... look out, look out!
[11:14.020 --> 11:14.540]  There you go, see?
[11:15.740 --> 11:17.380]  What's the, uh, Eric, what's the
[11:17.380 --> 11:19.240]  slam the thing onto the ground RB
[11:19.240 --> 11:19.920]  attack do?
[11:20.820 --> 11:23.140]  Oh, so you are, with this
[11:23.140 --> 11:25.180]  pyro class guy, you are trying
[11:25.180 --> 11:26.760]  to build that yellow bar.
[11:27.060 --> 11:29.300]  When the yellow bar is built,
[11:30.340 --> 11:31.140]  you can
[11:31.140 --> 11:32.960]  hit RB and then
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.080]  all of your
[11:35.020 --> 11:37.100]  damage that you do for a short period of time
[11:37.100 --> 11:38.400]  is all fire imbued.
[11:38.840 --> 11:41.460]  So everything you do has fire damage to it.
[11:41.680 --> 11:42.620]  So I can't block anymore?
[11:43.500 --> 11:44.980]  No, there's no block with this character.
[11:45.260 --> 11:47.200]  Oh, shit. Sentinel is the only block
[11:47.200 --> 11:49.260]  class. It's why you have to consider
[11:49.260 --> 11:50.600]  the pros and cons. I got your back, Andrew.
[11:51.540 --> 11:52.420]  Oh, thank you, Eric!
[11:52.560 --> 11:55.140]  Yeah, like, I'm a pure offense character.
[11:55.380 --> 11:56.160]  Like a rogue.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.800]  No armor, no defense.
[11:58.800 --> 12:00.260]  Oh, shit!
[12:01.560 --> 12:02.380]  There we go.
[12:02.840 --> 12:04.000]  Billy Kane style.
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.640]  Oh, we gotta take these out.
[12:06.880 --> 12:07.580]  We have to take out the tent.
[12:08.780 --> 12:10.760]  They're like the spider spawners
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.800]  in the caves of Minecraft.
[12:12.400 --> 12:12.880]  Oh, careful!
[12:15.060 --> 12:15.840]  Suck us!
[12:19.340 --> 12:20.220]  Suck us.
[12:21.020 --> 12:22.460]  Wouldn't want to do that with a spiked tail.
[12:23.860 --> 12:24.620]  Yeah, well,
[12:24.940 --> 12:26.400]  you really gotta be cleanly for that.
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.640]  Man, I just attacked no one
[12:28.640 --> 12:30.200]  for like seven hits in a row.
[12:30.200 --> 12:31.060]  Oh, I learned a bunch.
[12:33.500 --> 12:34.840]  Are you the only one
[12:34.840 --> 12:36.320]  who didn't do the tutorial, Gav?
[12:36.940 --> 12:38.840]  Uh, I did...
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.540]  Oh, you did it.
[12:40.120 --> 12:41.720]  So you don't mind juggling the enemies?
[12:42.080 --> 12:42.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.540]  I just didn't ever get to a class in the tutorial.
[12:48.920 --> 12:49.800]  I didn't do it.
[12:52.100 --> 12:52.500]  Boom!
[12:53.020 --> 12:53.420]  Nice!
[12:53.420 --> 12:55.320]  You know what, we're doing way better than I thought we would.
[12:55.540 --> 12:57.340]  We're tearing it up! We're a team, baby!
[12:57.580 --> 12:59.460]  I am concerned that we're
[12:59.460 --> 13:00.680]  gonna get a boss or something.
[13:01.020 --> 13:02.760]  This is gonna wreck us.
[13:02.780 --> 13:04.640]  There's no way we're losing in this.
[13:04.860 --> 13:05.980]  They wouldn't do that to us.
[13:07.320 --> 13:09.580]  Not when we're trying to show off the game.
[13:10.140 --> 13:10.500]  That's right.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.440]  Making us lose would make us
[13:13.440 --> 13:14.980]  look bad, and they don't want to do that.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.380]  Us succeeding only makes
[13:17.380 --> 13:18.100]  them look good.
[13:18.500 --> 13:19.240]  That's right.
[13:23.860 --> 13:24.380]  Fire.
[13:27.200 --> 13:28.020]  There we go.
[13:29.380 --> 13:30.520]  Ripping this leather.
[13:31.780 --> 13:32.660]  Oh, hell!
[13:33.180 --> 13:34.820]  That rock!
[13:35.680 --> 13:37.620]  Nobody was coming out of that stuff.
[13:37.660 --> 13:38.000]  Great job.
[13:39.800 --> 13:40.980]  No shelter for you.
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.860]  It'd be funny if it was just like a
[13:43.420 --> 13:44.060]  villager's tent.
[13:44.480 --> 13:46.220]  Like they're just camping.
[13:46.520 --> 13:49.600]  You've armored yourself now, Gav, so you went from level 1 to level 4
[13:49.600 --> 13:50.800]  on some stuff, probably.
[13:50.800 --> 13:52.680]  Yeah, on my clothes.
[13:53.260 --> 13:55.140]  Yeah. So that makes a big difference.
[13:56.240 --> 13:56.940]  So in those
[13:56.940 --> 13:58.820]  regular items, there are things in them sometimes?
[13:58.900 --> 14:00.300]  Because I have yet to find anything.
[14:00.400 --> 14:02.940]  There are occasionally, you pick
[14:02.940 --> 14:05.000]  it up instant. Like, it's so
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.900]  fast, so you've probably
[14:06.900 --> 14:08.160]  seen stuff.
[14:08.580 --> 14:11.120]  It just looks like one of those little spheres
[14:11.120 --> 14:12.820]  in Power World that you
[14:12.820 --> 14:13.820]  use to catch the creatures.
[14:14.620 --> 14:15.680]  Like a little gold one of those.
[14:16.200 --> 14:17.520]  The spear guy is pretty strong.
[14:18.180 --> 14:19.280]  Yeah, you just have to
[14:19.280 --> 14:21.420]  be careful with the way these guys
[14:21.420 --> 14:22.000]  attack.
[14:23.760 --> 14:25.260]  Oh, damn!
[14:25.520 --> 14:26.480]  You've got to get out of there.
[14:27.360 --> 14:28.880]  Get out of the middle of things.
[14:30.440 --> 14:31.560]  How do you heal?
[14:32.240 --> 14:32.840]  You don't.
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.960]  There are like healing stations
[14:35.960 --> 14:37.660]  at least. I've never seen
[14:37.660 --> 14:39.860]  one in the game after the first one they showed me.
[14:40.040 --> 14:41.060]  Yeah, I saw one in the tutorial.
[14:41.560 --> 14:41.720]  Yep.
[14:43.240 --> 14:43.820]  Bomb guy.
[14:43.820 --> 14:44.780]  Flame power!
[14:46.160 --> 14:47.720]  Did you just spawn
[14:47.720 --> 14:48.160]  health?
[14:49.680 --> 14:51.680]  I just saw a green health thing
[14:51.680 --> 14:52.940]  shoot out of your spear, Gavin.
[14:53.600 --> 14:54.340]  Maybe you did.
[14:55.040 --> 14:57.580]  Maybe there's a healing class. Andrew's getting
[14:57.580 --> 14:58.500]  plus sixes.
[14:59.740 --> 15:00.740]  Oh yeah, plus twelve.
[15:01.540 --> 15:03.260]  I mean, there is...
[15:03.260 --> 15:05.960]  You can get stuff to heal over time.
[15:06.080 --> 15:06.900]  Maybe it's my gear?
[15:07.760 --> 15:09.860]  Hang on, you've got to make these jumps. Come on, Pico Park.
[15:09.880 --> 15:11.900]  You can do it. Oh, what? You have a double
[15:11.900 --> 15:12.280]  jump?
[15:13.280 --> 15:13.960]  Don't hit that.
[15:14.940 --> 15:19.140]  Hit it when you draw them to it.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.900]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[15:24.120 --> 15:24.240]  Gavin!
[15:25.860 --> 15:27.400]  You want to hit it once.
[15:27.400 --> 15:29.540]  Oh, that's the one I shouldn't hit. And then back away.
[15:33.420 --> 15:34.500]  Oh, Gavin.
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.920]  Stand still for a second. I've got a dog I need to cook.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.120]  I've got some marshmallows.
[15:40.320 --> 15:40.720]  Yeah!
[15:42.700 --> 15:43.240]  I also keep
[15:43.240 --> 15:45.160]  trying to fight Gavin because his name is Red.
[15:45.940 --> 15:46.240]  Yeah.
[15:47.080 --> 15:48.440]  Oh, really?
[15:48.800 --> 15:50.220]  How do I set this off?
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.300]  Yeah, just like that.
[15:52.580 --> 15:54.360]  Yeah, and then just put the dudes over by it.
[15:56.300 --> 15:57.140]  I like that you can throw
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.300]  people in the air and shoot them.
[16:01.160 --> 16:01.860]  I got you.
[16:02.680 --> 16:04.620]  I'm holding my own. Yeah, you're doing great.
[16:06.940 --> 16:08.020]  That, uh,
[16:08.160 --> 16:09.780]  like the poison attack thing
[16:09.780 --> 16:11.320]  that you do, Geoff, is like so good.
[16:11.720 --> 16:12.760]  Yeah, it's fucking awesome.
[16:13.900 --> 16:14.980]  Dude, this game looks fun.
[16:15.480 --> 16:17.400]  Gavin is out of lives, I've just noticed.
[16:17.760 --> 16:18.180]  Oh, really?
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.620]  You know what, Nick? You'll never know.
[16:21.360 --> 16:21.960]  Yeah, that's true.
[16:23.960 --> 16:25.240]  Have you guys failed
[16:25.240 --> 16:25.960]  one of these?
[16:26.360 --> 16:28.320]  Yes, I have. I failed one.
[16:28.680 --> 16:30.120]  You just restart it if you want to.
[16:31.500 --> 16:33.160]  There didn't seem to be any punishment
[16:33.160 --> 16:33.560]  or anything.
[16:35.480 --> 16:36.700]  We're doing great.
[16:36.940 --> 16:38.540]  Oh my god.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.580]  Oh, you're fighting
[16:44.880 --> 16:45.540]  guys over here.
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.620]  A couple of guys keep spawning over here.
[16:48.800 --> 16:49.720]  Keep dropping stuff, too.
[16:50.540 --> 16:52.940]  I'm so used to
[16:52.940 --> 16:54.920]  a side-scrolling
[16:54.920 --> 16:57.140]  brawler game being restricted to the same
[16:57.140 --> 16:58.440]  perspective for everyone.
[16:58.800 --> 17:01.300]  It healed all of us, too.
[17:02.320 --> 17:03.120]  Hell yeah.
[17:04.160 --> 17:05.660]  There's a big camp up ahead.
[17:06.200 --> 17:07.440]  You need to shake it out quickly.
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.520]  There's a bonus in it for you.
[17:10.380 --> 17:11.200]  Occasionally you come across
[17:11.200 --> 17:11.880]  challenge encounters.
[17:12.720 --> 17:14.280]  Cool, let's do it.
[17:15.100 --> 17:16.740]  I'm fucking running with my knives behind me.
[17:17.060 --> 17:17.460]  Fast!
[17:19.520 --> 17:20.480]  Take out four tents.
[17:20.780 --> 17:21.700]  Let's focus on each.
[17:23.420 --> 17:25.080]  You focus on the tents together.
[17:25.220 --> 17:26.300]  I think we'll do this really fast.
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.300]  I'm just running through.
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.280]  I'm at the second tent.
[17:30.740 --> 17:31.540]  I'm going bottom.
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.300]  I like this strategy. This is good.
[17:37.660 --> 17:38.520]  Feel good about
[17:38.520 --> 17:39.740]  what we're doing.
[17:40.320 --> 17:40.940]  There's that tent.
[17:41.280 --> 17:42.660]  Coming down to the bottom.
[17:43.540 --> 17:44.520]  One more, one more.
[17:44.640 --> 17:45.980]  Let's keep moving.
[17:47.700 --> 17:48.640]  Gavin, you want to give me a hand?
[17:49.780 --> 17:50.860]  Working at it.
[17:52.360 --> 17:53.620]  I'm trying to keep off our backs.
[17:54.040 --> 17:54.620]  Double up.
[17:54.620 --> 17:56.120]  Uh, uh, uh.
[17:56.500 --> 17:57.520]  We almost got it.
[17:57.920 --> 17:58.420]  Nice!
[18:00.900 --> 18:02.160]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18:02.440 --> 18:03.480]  Got some pal-spheres.
[18:04.500 --> 18:05.280]  Oh shit.
[18:06.380 --> 18:07.580]  Gobo and Pirate Tail.
[18:09.360 --> 18:10.320]  Oh shit, that's the boss.
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.480]  Hold Y on him to break his shield.
[18:15.180 --> 18:16.180]  Oh boy.
[18:16.840 --> 18:18.080]  I'm going to slam my fire on.
[18:18.520 --> 18:20.580]  Do it. I'll do the same.
[18:21.140 --> 18:21.540]  Good move.
[18:22.400 --> 18:23.280]  There we go.
[18:23.420 --> 18:25.620]  Keep taking him out. You break that shield down.
[18:25.820 --> 18:27.380]  And then he'll get dazed.
[18:27.480 --> 18:28.440]  You beat the fuck out of him.
[18:28.960 --> 18:30.300]  There we go.
[18:30.520 --> 18:32.220]  Just fucking land him.
[18:33.340 --> 18:34.460]  Get him with everything.
[18:34.700 --> 18:35.900]  We're doing so much damage.
[18:37.200 --> 18:38.040]  Oh no.
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.800]  Damn, he's got a lot of health.
[18:41.740 --> 18:43.180]  We only got to do that one more time though.
[18:43.360 --> 18:43.740]  We got it.
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.560]  Tail, tail, tail.
[18:48.120 --> 18:48.540]  Damn.
[18:52.560 --> 18:53.780]  There we go.
[18:54.760 --> 18:55.360]  Got him.
[18:55.540 --> 18:56.740]  Get him with everything.
[18:57.860 --> 18:59.660]  Fucking using my powers.
[19:01.760 --> 19:02.880]  Got him.
[19:03.200 --> 19:04.600]  Hell yeah.
[19:05.640 --> 19:06.120]  Yeah.
[19:06.500 --> 19:07.160]  Give me some loot.
[19:11.020 --> 19:11.580]  Nice.
[19:12.500 --> 19:13.060]  Victory.
[19:13.620 --> 19:15.140]  I really like this game.
[19:15.180 --> 19:16.260]  I can't believe we did that.
[19:16.380 --> 19:18.120]  Level 16 or what was it? 28?
[19:18.120 --> 19:18.860]  Level 300?
[19:19.140 --> 19:20.600]  We were supposed to be at level 1,000?
[19:20.740 --> 19:22.040]  Level 7,000 I believe, yeah.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.380]  It said over 9,000 recommended.
[19:26.180 --> 19:27.380]  Oh, Oasis Daggers?
[19:27.720 --> 19:29.100]  Maybe it's just all levels combined.
[19:30.200 --> 19:31.160]  Oasis Daggers.
[19:31.460 --> 19:33.920]  Should we go to the Belfry for everybody to level up?
[19:33.920 --> 19:35.480]  Yeah, let's go back to the Belfry.
[19:36.440 --> 19:36.700]  What?
[19:37.120 --> 19:37.540]  What?
[19:41.260 --> 19:42.220]  Do you remember that
[19:42.220 --> 19:44.080]  Sesame Street song that the Count
[19:44.080 --> 19:45.880]  would sing about bats in his Belfry?
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.080]  It went...
[19:48.080 --> 19:50.300]  One bat in my Belfry.
[19:50.720 --> 19:52.040]  One bat flies
[19:52.040 --> 19:53.160]  in through the door.
[19:53.400 --> 19:56.040]  That makes two bats in my Belfry.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.380]  Ah, but wait.
[19:57.640 --> 19:58.500]  There's more.
[19:59.260 --> 20:01.300]  Two bats sitting in my Belfry.
[20:02.340 --> 20:04.480]  One bat flies in through the door.
[20:05.000 --> 20:05.620]  Nah, but wait.
[20:05.860 --> 20:06.740]  That makes three bats.
[20:08.400 --> 20:09.300]  There you go.
[20:09.520 --> 20:09.860]  It's a cool song.
[20:10.500 --> 20:11.820]  I had the LP when I was a kid.
[20:11.820 --> 20:13.360]  Oh, really?
[20:14.700 --> 20:17.020]  I wore that record out, dude.
[20:17.340 --> 20:18.380]  It had that
[20:18.380 --> 20:19.540]  and it had Burt and Ernie
[20:19.540 --> 20:21.860]  singing the ABC 123 song.
[20:22.600 --> 20:23.880]  That was fucking awesome too.
[20:26.060 --> 20:26.860]  Rubber Ducky?
[20:27.660 --> 20:28.780]  Yeah, that was in it as well.
[20:29.500 --> 20:32.200]  I think the cover of the record might have been
[20:32.200 --> 20:33.620]  Ernie or Burt in the bathtub.
[20:33.860 --> 20:34.560]  No, Ernie in the bathtub.
[20:36.040 --> 20:37.800]  Complete the danger license trial?
[20:37.900 --> 20:38.560]  What does that mean?
[20:38.560 --> 20:40.000]  I wanna just go fight stuff.
[20:40.080 --> 20:41.420]  Let me know when you're done upgrading.
[20:41.640 --> 20:42.340]  I'm in the world map.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.540]  How do I get licensed in danger?
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.120]  You have to do a mission for that.
[20:50.840 --> 20:52.780]  Are you not licensed in danger?
[20:55.100 --> 20:56.100]  Alright, I'm gonna go back to the world map.
[20:56.100 --> 20:58.440]  I had my license in danger, but then I didn't think
[20:58.440 --> 21:00.420]  I'd be in danger, so I let it lapse.
[21:00.460 --> 21:02.360]  Honestly, I did it.
[21:02.460 --> 21:04.600]  I got my license in danger, but something happened.
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.540]  Danger's my middle name and it fucked up
[21:06.540 --> 21:07.500]  the whole process.
[21:08.080 --> 21:09.800]  Everything got messed up because of it.
[21:10.180 --> 21:11.020]  It was very confusing.
[21:12.800 --> 21:14.540]  I'm gonna change my middle name to DMV.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.400]  Alright, I'm ready to go.
[21:19.140 --> 21:20.360]  I'm in the world map.
[21:20.420 --> 21:21.100]  Do you want me to just pick one?
[21:21.300 --> 21:22.860]  Let's do it.
[21:24.220 --> 21:25.880]  Alright, ready it up.
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.380]  I'm gonna play this game.
[21:30.160 --> 21:31.760]  I'm gonna play this game so much.
[21:32.280 --> 21:33.320]  Here's the thing to note, Eric.
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.580]  We are in a pre-early build
[21:35.580 --> 21:37.900]  that will not carry progress over.
[21:38.860 --> 21:39.420]  What?!
[21:39.420 --> 21:40.880]  But I have Bart Simpson!
[21:41.460 --> 21:42.420]  I'm like level 4!
[21:43.480 --> 21:45.340]  No! Bart Simpson!
[21:48.140 --> 21:50.800]  After this, we should play MapleStory.
[21:52.660 --> 21:54.260]  He's not kidding, he loves that game.
[21:55.600 --> 21:57.300]  I probably played it 20 years ago.
[21:58.440 --> 21:58.820]  Fuck.
[22:01.060 --> 22:03.020]  Got my shit pushed in by a tree trunk.
[22:04.960 --> 22:07.080]  You know, if I didn't know you were talking about MapleStory,
[22:07.140 --> 22:08.200]  that's a weird sentence, man.
[22:10.020 --> 22:11.060]  Just fell down hard.
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.120]  Without knowing what MapleStory is, it's still weird.
[22:17.460 --> 22:19.240]  Bet it wouldn't happen if you had a spiked tail.
[22:20.500 --> 22:21.540]  Now we're talking.
[22:21.540 --> 22:22.580]  Oh, yeah.
[22:25.060 --> 22:26.740]  Gavin, what are those bees up to over there?
[22:27.280 --> 22:27.880]  Don't do it.
[22:28.480 --> 22:29.460]  Oh, no!
[22:30.340 --> 22:34.460]  Oh, I got bees all over that guy.
[22:36.780 --> 22:37.880]  I find bee stings
[22:37.880 --> 22:38.820]  to take to kill a man.
[22:39.160 --> 22:41.320]  I find the bees to be unpredictable
[22:41.320 --> 22:42.080]  as a weapon.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.700]  They are very unpredictable.
[22:45.380 --> 22:47.280]  If I'm hitting someone with bees on,
[22:47.360 --> 22:48.060]  do I get the bees?
[22:48.060 --> 22:49.480]  You might get the bees.
[22:49.560 --> 22:52.160]  I think if you're close to the bees,
[22:52.320 --> 22:53.720]  they may transfer to you.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.580]  You might get bee transferred.
[22:55.760 --> 22:56.640]  You just reminded me,
[22:56.740 --> 22:59.740]  I was watching the Phillies
[22:59.740 --> 23:01.680]  and Braves play
[23:01.680 --> 23:03.300]  on ESPN last night,
[23:03.340 --> 23:05.780]  and they had a commercial for an episode coming up
[23:05.780 --> 23:09.080]  for that 9-1-1 show
[23:09.080 --> 23:10.000]  that takes place in Austin.
[23:11.440 --> 23:12.780]  It said something like,
[23:12.860 --> 23:15.040]  500 bee stings can kill a man.
[23:15.040 --> 23:16.620]  And then it was like...
[23:16.620 --> 23:16.800]  Oh, really?
[23:17.280 --> 23:19.960]  Someone calling on a phone,
[23:20.400 --> 23:22.260]  and a 9-1-1 operator picking up,
[23:22.380 --> 23:22.900]  and someone going,
[23:23.740 --> 23:24.300]  BEEEEEE!
[23:25.920 --> 23:28.320]  And then just the sound
[23:28.320 --> 23:31.220]  of thousands of bees,
[23:31.340 --> 23:31.880]  and it said,
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.140]  BeeNato is coming.
[23:35.720 --> 23:36.800]  BeeNato coming?
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.900]  Dude, that fucking show.
[23:40.020 --> 23:41.980]  I tried to watch three episodes of it.
[23:41.980 --> 23:46.780]  It is... the only thing that takes place in Austin in that show is the intro.
[23:47.740 --> 23:48.420]  Oh, really?
[23:48.840 --> 23:53.220]  Yeah. The title screen is in Austin. It goes over the fuckin' Congress Bridge.
[23:53.280 --> 23:56.880]  But that's about it. The entire show is shot in L.A. and it is very clear.
[23:56.960 --> 23:57.180]  Yes.
[23:57.320 --> 23:59.220]  When you're like, we don't have chain-link fences.
[23:59.840 --> 24:00.940]  We don't have those kind of trees.
[24:02.220 --> 24:04.160]  We don't have back alleys like that. Like, what the fuck?
[24:05.800 --> 24:06.840]  Like, it's, uh...
[24:06.840 --> 24:07.480]  That's South Central.
[24:07.480 --> 24:12.100]  Anything... might be my favorite moment from Jackass 3.
[24:12.420 --> 24:14.140]  They do the beehive tetherball.
[24:14.300 --> 24:14.620]  Oh, yeah!
[24:15.160 --> 24:17.220]  And they ask, how many bee stings does it take to kill a man?
[24:17.300 --> 24:18.760]  And Manny's like, oh, I think it's a hundred.
[24:19.280 --> 24:21.080]  And then they have like 10,000 bees.
[24:21.280 --> 24:23.160]  Dave England is just like, what are we doing here?
[24:25.440 --> 24:26.560]  Manny was so great.
[24:27.100 --> 24:28.020]  Oh, he's the best.
[24:28.760 --> 24:29.740]  Oh, he's so funny.
[24:31.740 --> 24:35.000]  I really like the, uh... that last Jackass movie.
[24:35.120 --> 24:35.840]  I didn't see it.
[24:36.060 --> 24:37.080]  Yeah. It was good.
[24:37.640 --> 24:38.300]  It was fun.
[24:38.440 --> 24:42.400]  I have enjoyed every Jackass movie at the time in which it came out.
[24:42.440 --> 24:43.380]  Yeah, absolutely.
[24:44.040 --> 24:45.000]  I wonder if...
[24:45.000 --> 24:45.620]  You don't like Jackass 1 now?
[24:46.580 --> 24:51.360]  I don't think it holds up as well, considering the budget and stuff they acquired.
[24:51.680 --> 24:52.040]  Oh, interesting.
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.940]  You know what? I tried to go back...
[24:53.940 --> 24:54.280]  But it has a charm to it.
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.040]  I tried to go back and watch an episode of Jackass, uh, maybe six months ago.
[24:58.060 --> 25:01.620]  And I was like, oh yeah, this is not as polished as I remember.
[25:01.880 --> 25:02.140]  No.
[25:02.640 --> 25:02.920]  No.
[25:03.100 --> 25:05.580]  Not that you think it is polished, but you know what I mean.
[25:05.580 --> 25:07.360]  Early seasons are like...
[25:07.360 --> 25:09.040]  I love early Jackass.
[25:09.440 --> 25:12.760]  I love just Stevo, like, hunched behind a building, swallowing a fish.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.200]  It's like so...
[25:15.060 --> 25:16.420]  So ropey looking, I love it.
[25:20.540 --> 25:20.900]  Okay.
[25:21.200 --> 25:23.320]  Dude, we are tearing these guys apart. We rock.
[25:23.400 --> 25:25.740]  I wish... I wish they would start a...
[25:25.740 --> 25:27.840]  They were supposed to have a new series, right?
[25:27.880 --> 25:30.000]  That's what they were doing with Poopies and all those guys.
[25:30.000 --> 25:30.680]  Oh, is that the plan?
[25:31.240 --> 25:32.760]  I think so. It was supposed to be a Paramount show.
[25:33.080 --> 25:35.440]  I feel like I read about it, and then it just never...
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.100]  Yeah.
[25:36.380 --> 25:36.900]  Never happened.
[25:37.220 --> 25:41.040]  That was a mistake where I think it was reported they were doing a Jackass show.
[25:41.460 --> 25:44.820]  It was actually the Johnny Knoxville prank show that he did.
[25:44.980 --> 25:45.240]  Oh.
[25:46.940 --> 25:47.720]  Somebody pick me up.
[25:47.820 --> 25:48.660]  It was completely unrelated.
[25:48.960 --> 25:49.240]  Never mind.
[25:49.340 --> 25:49.780]  Oh, you're down?
[25:49.880 --> 25:50.080]  Yeah.
[25:50.380 --> 25:52.020]  Shit. I didn't know I could pick you up. Sorry.
[25:52.240 --> 25:54.540]  I don't know if you can. I just thought we could.
[25:55.940 --> 25:57.280]  Now that we're all in the thing together.
[25:57.280 --> 25:58.520]  He just wanted someone to pick us up.
[25:59.140 --> 26:01.720]  Well, it's like in Gears. If you go down, you're pretty much dead.
[26:01.880 --> 26:03.040]  Yeah, this is just like Gears.
[26:03.920 --> 26:05.300]  Well, four-player co-op.
[26:06.340 --> 26:07.260]  Helping each other out.
[26:07.500 --> 26:08.820]  This game breaks a lot less than Gears.
[26:08.820 --> 26:09.400]  Yeah, who's the robot?
[26:10.280 --> 26:10.980]  Who's the robot?
[26:11.880 --> 26:15.160]  I think we're all recording right now, which is different than Gears.
[26:16.120 --> 26:16.740]  Well, at least one's picking you up.
[26:16.740 --> 26:18.820]  You just wait until you see what we end up with.
[26:19.060 --> 26:19.300]  Yeah.
[26:22.380 --> 26:23.680]  Man, I love juggling people.
[26:24.780 --> 26:24.960]  Wow.
[26:27.720 --> 26:29.100]  Discuss a problem, solve it.
[26:29.180 --> 26:32.060]  I was like, I wish there was a way to get the quests off my screen.
[26:32.060 --> 26:34.980]  That is a button that says quests.
[26:35.400 --> 26:35.880]  Yep.
[26:36.140 --> 26:38.060]  Oh, I didn't even see that was there.
[26:39.160 --> 26:40.220]  I turned it off.
[26:49.380 --> 26:53.540]  I need to get into the swing of not just sitting on my specials forever.
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.100]  No.
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.360]  Yeah, they can't recharge if you don't use them.
[26:56.760 --> 26:59.140]  Yeah, they want you to use them a lot.
[27:00.040 --> 27:04.720]  Are you like me in that you will keep every single bit of ammo
[27:04.720 --> 27:05.780]  that you have?
[27:08.020 --> 27:09.480]  Save it for the boss that's never coming.
[27:10.180 --> 27:11.480]  What if I need 150 Phoenix Downs, Nick?
[27:11.500 --> 27:12.580]  What am I supposed to do then?
[27:13.560 --> 27:14.580]  You just have to restart the game.
[27:15.560 --> 27:15.800]  Yeah.
[27:17.080 --> 27:21.400]  I have 330 minor potions and I'm about to fight the last boss.
[27:21.540 --> 27:22.560]  What if I need them?
[27:23.780 --> 27:26.440]  I started doing a thing when I was a teenager when in games,
[27:26.520 --> 27:29.040]  if ever I got a power weapon or something that had like three shots,
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.200]  I would use it on the next three enemies that I saw.
[27:31.240 --> 27:32.320]  Oh my God.
[27:32.320 --> 27:33.980]  That's an interesting rule of thumb.
[27:34.180 --> 27:36.980]  Just as like a way to force yourself to not save it.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.560]  And you end up just getting a lot more of it.
[27:38.740 --> 27:42.760]  Whereas Dan would always end up with like just holding the gun until the end of the game.
[27:42.800 --> 27:43.160]  Oh, the gauntlets.
[27:43.560 --> 27:44.140]  That's crazy.
[27:46.160 --> 27:48.520]  Dude, I love this class.
[27:48.660 --> 27:49.500]  Geoff, you look like shit.
[27:49.880 --> 27:50.300]  Thank you.
[27:50.620 --> 27:51.720]  I look like Bart Simpson.
[27:52.080 --> 27:52.600]  This is awesome.
[27:52.680 --> 27:55.720]  I guess it is one thing I liked about Halo is that it kind of forced you to do that.
[27:56.520 --> 27:58.020]  Because you could only carry a couple weapons.
[27:59.340 --> 27:59.800]  Let's see.
[28:00.820 --> 28:01.880]  Want to jump into another one?
[28:01.880 --> 28:02.620]  What do you guys want to do?
[28:02.980 --> 28:03.500]  Yeah, let's do it.
[28:03.500 --> 28:04.020]  Let's do one more.
[28:05.040 --> 28:06.680]  Yeah, I used to love rockets on grunts.
[28:09.380 --> 28:10.640]  I'll teach him, little bastards.
[28:11.660 --> 28:12.880]  Recommended gear score five.
[28:13.020 --> 28:13.940]  I think we got it.
[28:14.440 --> 28:16.840]  Um, yeah, I think we got it.
[28:19.200 --> 28:20.460]  Gavin doesn't got it.
[28:20.660 --> 28:20.920]  Apparently.
[28:21.800 --> 28:23.060]  Would you like to have it, Gavin?
[28:24.280 --> 28:25.740]  Am I meant to be not on a loading screen?
[28:26.200 --> 28:26.440]  Oh.
[28:27.960 --> 28:29.020]  Oh, there he is.
[28:30.540 --> 28:31.400]  Or he's gone.
[28:32.100 --> 28:33.760]  We'll drag you out kicking and screaming.
[28:36.480 --> 28:38.280]  Yep, the windmill does remind me.
[28:39.140 --> 28:40.140]  Oh, no.
[28:40.560 --> 28:42.380]  It's all I think of when I see that.
[28:44.460 --> 28:47.880]  On a rewatch, it turns out that all Gavin did was say yes.
[28:49.160 --> 28:49.540]  Oh, yeah.
[28:50.360 --> 28:51.640]  I have not to blame.
[28:52.340 --> 28:53.160]  Gavin, do you think this is cool?
[28:53.240 --> 28:54.060]  Oh, wait, let me go back.
[28:54.300 --> 28:57.700]  I don't think it's as cool as me charging up my stick before we fight.
[28:57.700 --> 29:00.980]  Looks like Gavin is doing the setup for we will rock you and Eric.
[29:02.860 --> 29:04.840]  Geoff, Geoff didn't care for it.
[29:04.900 --> 29:09.020]  So he decided he's like, let's go fight idiots.
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.000]  We have to save the people of the Belfry.
[29:16.380 --> 29:20.200]  They already destroyed the city of numbers or whatever the fuck it was called.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.720]  You guys taking care of business?
[29:23.480 --> 29:24.760]  Yeah, every day.
[29:24.840 --> 29:25.080]  Hang on.
[29:25.140 --> 29:26.260]  You might not be able to see that.
[29:26.300 --> 29:26.540]  Hang on.
[29:27.820 --> 29:28.600]  There you go.
[29:28.800 --> 29:29.480]  Is that cool?
[29:29.920 --> 29:30.800]  Oh, you saw dancing?
[29:31.480 --> 29:31.820]  Oh, yeah.
[29:31.920 --> 29:32.980]  You know, he's stinking.
[29:33.160 --> 29:34.940]  Yeah, I'm picking it up, bro.
[29:35.120 --> 29:36.500]  You're a real Bruce Green over there.
[29:42.480 --> 29:42.880]  Forever.
[29:43.920 --> 29:46.620]  I have one fact and you're going to hear about it.
[29:47.260 --> 29:47.660]  Forever.
[29:53.020 --> 29:54.920]  Oh, I got hit enough of this.
[29:54.920 --> 29:55.380]  Yeah.
[30:00.130 --> 30:03.130]  God, I love this gameplay loop.
[30:03.310 --> 30:03.850]  I love.
[30:04.150 --> 30:05.410]  Oh, no, they want to fight.
[30:05.630 --> 30:08.330]  I thought maybe if I was friendly, waved at one.
[30:09.570 --> 30:09.930]  Waved.
[30:10.050 --> 30:14.970]  This is making me think I need Hulk hands or like better Hulk hands in real life.
[30:15.050 --> 30:15.710]  Oh, yeah.
[30:15.730 --> 30:16.250]  Better Hulk.
[30:16.410 --> 30:17.190]  I'm going around with these.
[30:17.350 --> 30:19.390]  Yeah, I gotta be a better Hulk hand.
[30:20.010 --> 30:20.630]  There has to be.
[30:20.630 --> 30:22.190]  What if you just made him out of metal, you know?
[30:23.310 --> 30:24.630]  Nah, then you'd be Dr. Doom.
[30:26.150 --> 30:28.510]  Oh, or Cyclops or Colossus, rather.
[30:28.710 --> 30:30.570]  Sorry, Cyclops, Cyclops.
[30:30.610 --> 30:31.430]  He just had normal hands.
[30:31.510 --> 30:34.870]  Yeah, it's Cyclops's things.
[30:35.130 --> 30:36.230]  They were not his hands.
[30:36.350 --> 30:37.430]  No, he had normal hands.
[30:37.570 --> 30:38.570]  That like wasn't his thing.
[30:39.610 --> 30:40.890]  Was there ever a Cyclops?
[30:41.850 --> 30:42.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:42.710 --> 30:43.810]  I think it was everyone else.
[30:44.270 --> 30:47.850]  He had a brother named Havok who was more powerful than him.
[30:48.070 --> 30:49.550]  Yeah, I mean, I guess he still does.
[30:50.030 --> 30:54.470]  His brother Havok was so powerful that if he used these the least amount of his
[30:54.470 --> 30:55.830]  power on a human, it would kill them.
[30:55.910 --> 30:57.950]  And so he was always scared to use his powers.
[30:58.670 --> 31:02.310]  I'm gonna go to an ophthalmologist and say I've got a problem with my clops.
[31:05.350 --> 31:06.110]  Sir, get out.
[31:06.530 --> 31:09.050]  Yeah, I haven't been able to shoot lasers like I used to.
[31:09.910 --> 31:10.470]  I don't know.
[31:11.870 --> 31:13.690]  Need like a contact for that.
[31:15.890 --> 31:18.770]  Eric is fucking raking up all the skank in XP.
[31:20.070 --> 31:25.790]  This rot. Being able to dance in the middle of all this is so awesome.
[31:28.230 --> 31:31.250]  There was a game we did once for Achievement Unaware.
[31:31.870 --> 31:33.170]  I think it was an X-Men game.
[31:33.270 --> 31:35.930]  It was like we're all on the same screen smacking the shit out of stuff.
[31:36.210 --> 31:39.710]  Yeah, I was sat really far away from the screen and it was tiny.
[31:40.050 --> 31:44.430]  So all I did was the same jumping move for the entire video.
[31:44.830 --> 31:47.590]  I would like jump dash across the screen back and forth.
[31:48.290 --> 31:52.230]  For literally an hour and people were not happy.
[31:56.570 --> 31:57.870]  I remember that.
[31:58.550 --> 32:00.550]  That sounds like something you would do.
[32:00.990 --> 32:02.010]  11 years ago.
[32:02.190 --> 32:04.170]  Yeah, I was about to say it was probably 2012.
[32:05.010 --> 32:05.290]  Yeah.
[32:05.490 --> 32:05.950]  13.
[32:06.250 --> 32:10.090]  Back when we used to play on like 15 inch monitors in the same room.
[32:10.610 --> 32:11.370]  Oh my God.
[32:11.690 --> 32:12.670]  Piled around each other.
[32:12.950 --> 32:13.510]  Fucking stinky.
[32:13.890 --> 32:16.850]  I was like three rows back and I couldn't see the screen.
[32:16.850 --> 32:17.550]  Oh my God.
[32:17.590 --> 32:18.310]  That's crazy.
[32:26.750 --> 32:27.190]  Fly.
[32:27.510 --> 32:28.470]  Try this again.
[32:28.690 --> 32:29.290]  Watch this.
[32:30.070 --> 32:30.950]  Let me try the...
[32:31.990 --> 32:32.930]  What do I got here?
[32:34.710 --> 32:34.970]  Throw!
[32:35.750 --> 32:36.030]  Throw!
[32:36.430 --> 32:37.270]  This is Eric's move.
[32:37.350 --> 32:37.730]  Oh my God.
[32:38.550 --> 32:39.150]  Yeah, I rock.
[32:39.870 --> 32:40.330]  Ooh, me?
[32:41.970 --> 32:42.750]  Everything's on fire.
[32:44.010 --> 32:46.630]  You guys encountered any like grappling classes?
[32:46.810 --> 32:47.510]  Because that'd be awesome.
[32:47.630 --> 32:48.750]  No, that would be really cool.
[32:48.750 --> 32:49.950]  I'd love to be able to throw things.
[32:49.950 --> 32:50.210]  Ooh.
[32:51.210 --> 32:53.250]  Yeah, I want to throw these guys at these guys.
[32:54.030 --> 32:58.250]  I just want to like suplex these fucking dumb goblin dudes.
[33:00.570 --> 33:06.390]  The amount of enemies that you get when it is four people I think is more than when you are just playing by yourself.
[33:06.390 --> 33:06.670]  Oh yeah.
[33:06.850 --> 33:07.370]  Oh yeah.
[33:07.530 --> 33:10.630]  But I don't think it's four times as much.
[33:11.110 --> 33:11.330]  No.
[33:14.470 --> 33:16.390]  It's definitely easier with a group.
[33:18.610 --> 33:22.010]  Remember when we went through Snaggleshire and we were afraid and now we live in no fear?
[33:22.650 --> 33:23.050]  Hey!
[33:23.690 --> 33:24.530]  We were afraid.
[33:24.730 --> 33:24.870]  Victory!
[33:26.530 --> 33:27.950]  I'm just glad there isn't friendly fire.
[33:28.690 --> 33:29.370]  That'd be a real problem.
[33:29.430 --> 33:30.050]  No, that'd be bad.
[33:31.730 --> 33:32.750]  Dude, this game's cool.
[33:32.990 --> 33:33.530]  I'm Bart Simpson.
[33:33.710 --> 33:34.450]  This is really cool.
[33:34.690 --> 33:35.830]  I'm excited to play more of this.
[33:36.390 --> 33:41.150]  Thank you once again so much to Xbox and Stoic for giving us a code to play it.
[33:41.770 --> 33:42.390]  This is great.
[33:44.950 --> 33:45.930]  Let's play again soon.
[33:46.390 --> 33:49.150]  That was the worst outro ever.
[33:49.550 --> 33:52.310]  There has to be something better you can say.
[33:52.510 --> 33:55.970]  I paused to see if any of you wanted to say anything.
[33:56.110 --> 33:58.850]  We were just hanging on your every word, Andrew.
[33:59.190 --> 34:00.830]  Why would we do the outro also?
[34:01.170 --> 34:03.350]  No, I was just curious if anyone had anything to say.
[34:03.770 --> 34:07.090]  I just realized that Geoff looks like Tobias from Arrested Velvet.
[34:08.730 --> 34:11.570]  Which is now my narrative headcanon for what you're doing.
[34:11.610 --> 34:13.150]  I was definitely going for a blue man group.
[34:14.450 --> 34:15.730]  I appreciate it a lot.
[34:15.730 --> 34:17.630]  Thank you so much for watching.
[34:17.730 --> 34:20.350]  We have a podcast, RegulationPod.
[34:20.490 --> 34:21.850]  We have a Patreon on the RegulationPod.
[34:23.090 --> 34:23.810]  RegulationPod.com
[34:23.810 --> 34:24.550]  Am I missing anything?
[34:24.710 --> 34:26.570]  No, but that was 30% better.
[34:26.790 --> 34:27.010]  Yeah.
[34:27.610 --> 34:28.170]  30%?
[34:28.350 --> 34:28.590]  Yeah.
[34:29.210 --> 34:29.970]  I'll take it.
[34:30.710 --> 34:31.770]  I'll take 30%.
[34:31.770 --> 34:33.090]  What a fun game.
[34:33.230 --> 34:35.130]  Can't believe we got to play it together.
[34:35.350 --> 34:36.310]  Jesus Christ.
[34:36.430 --> 34:38.490]  I can't wait until it comes out so we can do it some more.
[34:38.590 --> 34:39.370]  Thanks for watching.
[34:39.490 --> 34:41.970]  Thanks for listening to our podcast, The Regulation Podcast.
[34:42.190 --> 34:42.870]  If you do.
[34:42.970 --> 34:43.370]  If you don't.
[34:43.410 --> 34:44.290]  What is your problem?
[34:44.290 --> 34:46.110]  Why don't you like podcasts?
[34:46.290 --> 34:47.350]  Get into podcasts.
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.530]  It's 2024.
[34:49.170 --> 34:49.910]  We'll see you next week.
[34:50.410 --> 34:51.490]  Alright, now Eric, your turn.
[34:52.250 --> 34:54.550]  Guys, thanks so much for watching this.
[34:54.690 --> 34:56.150]  Did I look like Bart Simpson?
[34:56.350 --> 34:57.170]  You know I did.
[34:57.290 --> 35:02.510]  And here's me talking with Nick, who is Courage the Little Rabbit Man.
[35:02.910 --> 35:06.430]  And if you want to see more of Bart Simpson talking to Courage the Rabbit Man,
[35:06.610 --> 35:07.170]  you can.
