[00:00.000 --> 00:03.340]  Joining the game now, Wreckfest in effect.
[00:03.640 --> 00:04.820]  I see you loading in.
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.260]  Yeah, I'm trying. I'm trying.
[00:07.980 --> 00:11.660]  If you guys are watching this live, we want to thank you so much.
[00:11.720 --> 00:15.540]  But don't forget, you can also watch the VOD of this on Tuesday.
[00:16.600 --> 00:17.760]  You can check it out there.
[00:18.540 --> 00:21.120]  Try to make it as available as we can to everyone.
[00:21.380 --> 00:22.560]  Who's that message for?
[00:23.540 --> 00:24.020]  What?
[00:24.440 --> 00:26.460]  Well, this is the beginning of the stream.
[00:26.740 --> 00:29.340]  We haven't started yet, and you're saying that people can watch the VOD.
[00:29.340 --> 00:32.420]  Somebody who's listening right now, Gavin, has to leave in five minutes.
[00:32.500 --> 00:33.480]  And they're like, damn, I'll miss it.
[00:33.560 --> 00:36.480]  Yeah, I think maybe you could think about it for two seconds
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.980]  and figure out the answer to your questions.
[00:38.260 --> 00:41.740]  I just feel like this is one of the more useful places to say it.
[00:42.420 --> 00:44.540]  I like that Gavin attacks whoever's streaming.
[00:44.740 --> 00:46.340]  I'll leave it to you to say it.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.800]  You can say it when you feel appropriate.
[00:49.520 --> 00:51.840]  Okay, I'm going to start inviting people because we're...
[00:53.260 --> 00:55.520]  You can't have a three-person demolition derby.
[00:56.120 --> 00:57.300]  Right, that would be insane.
[00:57.300 --> 00:59.520]  And have people send messages.
[00:59.700 --> 01:02.460]  So I'm going to start sending out invites to those who have sent messages.
[01:02.920 --> 01:04.540]  I think we can have a max of eight people.
[01:04.900 --> 01:08.040]  We'll probably swap it around and get different people in here.
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.400]  What car are we doing?
[01:09.960 --> 01:10.280]  Or whatever.
[01:10.420 --> 01:11.040]  That's a good question.
[01:11.200 --> 01:13.140]  That is a great question.
[01:13.400 --> 01:15.520]  I kind of want to go with the sofa again, but that's me.
[01:15.620 --> 01:17.680]  Do you want to go sofa right off the gun?
[01:18.220 --> 01:19.160]  I love the sofa.
[01:19.460 --> 01:21.500]  I think it's a good description of what this game is.
[01:23.580 --> 01:24.220]  What, Gavin?
[01:24.860 --> 01:26.020]  Do you want to be the sofa king?
[01:26.940 --> 01:28.100]  Okay, all right.
[01:28.440 --> 01:29.600]  What is the sofa king?
[01:29.620 --> 01:31.700]  Let me know when you think it's appropriate to plug
[01:31.700 --> 01:32.720]  that people can watch this later.
[01:35.920 --> 01:36.800]  What is the sofa king?
[01:38.160 --> 01:40.060]  I change it to the sofa, the end.
[01:41.020 --> 01:41.660]  The end.
[01:42.340 --> 01:42.600]  Okay.
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.940]  Guys, thanks so much for the subs, the gifted subs, and the prime subs.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.400]  We appreciate it.
[01:51.500 --> 01:52.480]  This has been really great.
[01:52.560 --> 01:54.620]  Doing these Friday streams has been a lot of fun.
[01:55.020 --> 01:55.880]  It's been amazing.
[01:55.880 --> 01:57.000]  Mm-hmm.
[01:58.780 --> 01:59.820]  Yeah, I'm gonna swap.
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.360]  I'd say all of them.
[02:09.100 --> 02:10.820]  I've had a good time at all of them.
[02:11.140 --> 02:11.480]  So have I.
[02:12.220 --> 02:12.900]  Uh, okay.
[02:13.320 --> 02:13.840]  Oh, shit.
[02:14.020 --> 02:15.080]  Okay, change car.
[02:16.420 --> 02:16.900]  Save.
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.360]  There we go.
[02:18.600 --> 02:21.360]  Okay, let's get everyone on the sofa car.
[02:22.020 --> 02:23.360]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[02:23.820 --> 02:24.820]  How many people did you invite?
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.400]  I, uh, more than eight.
[02:28.400 --> 02:31.040]  But I'm just inviting, I'm just going down the list.
[02:34.120 --> 02:35.120]  We're at six.
[02:35.360 --> 02:36.480]  We only have two more slots.
[02:36.740 --> 02:37.880]  Oh, is that seven?
[02:39.700 --> 02:41.880]  I feel like you should be able to do like 70.
[02:42.820 --> 02:43.640]  You should be able to.
[02:43.660 --> 02:45.720]  Yeah, for this game, it should be 100.
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.180]  100%, absolutely.
[02:47.720 --> 02:49.220]  It should be way too many people.
[02:54.380 --> 02:56.140]  I see six of us so far.
[02:56.140 --> 02:58.320]  Yeah, I'm sending out invites.
[02:58.800 --> 02:59.160]  Cool.
[02:59.440 --> 03:00.660]  Nah, just keep doing what you're doing, man.
[03:01.720 --> 03:02.180]  I'm doing great.
[03:03.900 --> 03:05.780]  We recorded some stuff earlier today.
[03:05.900 --> 03:07.580]  I don't know when it's going to come out, but we...
[03:08.100 --> 03:11.300]  I thought that was really fun, what we recorded earlier.
[03:11.460 --> 03:12.280]  Just the three of us.
[03:12.740 --> 03:14.100]  Yeah, had a great time.
[03:14.300 --> 03:15.280]  It was one of the...
[03:15.280 --> 03:17.520]  We've never done it before, so it's always like,
[03:17.580 --> 03:19.580]  eh, I hope it goes well, and I think it did.
[03:20.020 --> 03:21.380]  Yeah, it was really, it was really good.
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.500]  I just feel like it's going to be one that we remember about in three months.
[03:25.500 --> 03:26.700]  And we're like, oh yeah!
[03:27.640 --> 03:29.280]  It's absolutely what's going to happen.
[03:29.800 --> 03:31.980]  Yeah, I definitely agree with you.
[03:33.060 --> 03:35.940]  I mean, there's stuff that we recorded that Eric doesn't even know about.
[03:36.300 --> 03:39.860]  I had to explain the thing we recorded last week, Gavin, with Geoff.
[03:40.540 --> 03:42.460]  I was originally going to do that today.
[03:42.700 --> 03:43.980]  Geoff is out.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.680]  He is, it's true.
[03:46.560 --> 03:49.700]  All right, J. Coop, switch over to that sofa car and let's do this thing.
[03:51.180 --> 03:51.720]  Yeah, we got eight.
[03:51.900 --> 03:52.120]  Awesome.
[03:52.600 --> 03:53.440]  Looks like it.
[03:53.640 --> 03:54.500]  We got eight!
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.680]  Yeah, all right.
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.480]  Oh, he's changing car.
[03:57.020 --> 03:58.880]  He's changing car, but I'm watching him.
[03:58.940 --> 03:59.620]  He's still on sweeper.
[03:59.640 --> 04:00.240]  I don't trust him.
[04:00.460 --> 04:01.800]  I don't trust J. Coop, honestly.
[04:02.480 --> 04:03.680]  Yeah, J. Coop is...
[04:04.440 --> 04:04.980]  Sofa car!
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.000]  All right, I set to ready.
[04:06.420 --> 04:08.500]  Is it murders or is it survival?
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.460]  Last man standing.
[04:10.580 --> 04:11.340]  Yep, this is it.
[04:12.120 --> 04:12.180]  Yeah.
[04:12.460 --> 04:14.040]  You'll find me hiding in the corner.
[04:17.220 --> 04:18.720]  You'll find me stretched out.
[04:19.020 --> 04:21.240]  Trying to find out who the sofa king is.
[04:21.380 --> 04:23.540]  And this is very exciting.
[04:23.540 --> 04:25.280]  I'm really, really excited to do this.
[04:25.420 --> 04:26.240]  What is the sofa king?
[04:26.340 --> 04:28.600]  J. Scoops or whatever just has to hit ready and then we're in business.
[04:28.780 --> 04:32.560]  And guys, there's no need to bully just one person who might be,
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.600]  you know, a part of the podcast that gets bullied a lot.
[04:36.340 --> 04:37.580]  Whoever you want to kill.
[04:38.040 --> 04:40.980]  I appreciate you advocating against me or for me, Gavin.
[04:42.220 --> 04:42.580]  Okay.
[04:44.280 --> 04:45.060]  Oh, who's that?
[04:45.140 --> 04:45.360]  Who's that?
[04:45.420 --> 04:46.620]  I'm going for the person in the corner.
[04:46.880 --> 04:47.620]  Oh, it's you, Gavin.
[04:52.080 --> 04:53.160]  Gavin's trying to hide.
[04:53.160 --> 04:55.520]  I got absolutely done.
[04:56.940 --> 04:57.840]  Can't hide, dude.
[04:58.640 --> 04:59.380]  Boom, baby.
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.300]  Oh, man.
[05:00.440 --> 05:01.100]  Come on, come on, come on.
[05:01.240 --> 05:02.020]  You're off the map.
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.020]  Are you dead, Gavin?
[05:03.720 --> 05:04.660]  I just have a light.
[05:04.840 --> 05:08.420]  Oh, no.
[05:09.300 --> 05:10.420]  I'm running you over.
[05:10.700 --> 05:11.960]  Ooh, I got run over.
[05:12.480 --> 05:13.280]  Come on.
[05:15.300 --> 05:16.100]  Oh, no.
[05:16.640 --> 05:18.020]  Now I'm fucking up my own car.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.220]  So people are chatting.
[05:19.740 --> 05:21.240]  You're watching Andrew's perspective.
[05:21.860 --> 05:22.880]  We don't have a name.
[05:22.880 --> 05:24.580]  No, we're watching Eric's perspective.
[05:24.760 --> 05:25.820]  We didn't put a name burn.
[05:27.160 --> 05:27.880]  Yeah, we don't have Nick.
[05:28.060 --> 05:31.760]  Why do we need a name burn?
[05:32.060 --> 05:32.940]  That's also a good point.
[05:33.040 --> 05:34.200]  There's only one perspective.
[05:34.200 --> 05:35.560]  Yeah, but they need to know who.
[05:36.220 --> 05:36.820]  But it's Eric.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.700]  Yeah, it's mine.
[05:37.920 --> 05:38.960]  We just solved it.
[05:39.260 --> 05:41.480]  Did you feel like that was the appropriate time to say that?
[05:41.940 --> 05:44.440]  Yeah, because people were asking in the chat and it doesn't say on the screen.
[05:44.600 --> 05:44.760]  So, yeah.
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.260]  No, that's fair.
[05:45.460 --> 05:45.760]  That's fair.
[05:46.700 --> 05:47.540]  Any other questions, Eric?
[05:48.120 --> 05:48.640]  No, no.
[05:48.700 --> 05:50.060]  I think that answered all of them.
[05:50.060 --> 05:52.260]  Oh, whoa, Andrew.
[05:52.660 --> 05:54.700]  I can't turn.
[05:54.820 --> 05:55.940]  I can't turn.
[05:56.880 --> 05:57.840]  Oh, Gavin.
[05:59.520 --> 06:00.980]  Gavin out of nowhere.
[06:01.640 --> 06:02.500]  Oh, no.
[06:03.140 --> 06:04.520]  There's four people left.
[06:05.560 --> 06:07.820]  Somehow, all three of us are in the group.
[06:09.600 --> 06:10.440]  Oh, here we go.
[06:11.640 --> 06:12.520]  Watch out, Josh.
[06:12.620 --> 06:13.660]  Oh, I got ragged.
[06:14.420 --> 06:15.780]  Both of your names just vanished.
[06:16.720 --> 06:17.320]  I finished.
[06:17.540 --> 06:18.640]  Is it just Gavin and I?
[06:19.200 --> 06:21.520]  Uh, no, Jacobs is still in here.
[06:21.520 --> 06:22.320]  They don't include you in the opponents.
[06:22.560 --> 06:22.700]  I see.
[06:22.740 --> 06:24.080]  Take their game in a cool way.
[06:24.360 --> 06:24.760]  Gotcha.
[06:25.180 --> 06:27.180]  No, they got me.
[06:28.460 --> 06:30.100]  How do I go to the next car?
[06:30.120 --> 06:30.820]  Oh, there you go.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.860]  Jacobs is in this thing, baby.
[06:35.360 --> 06:36.460]  If you want to go to...
[06:36.460 --> 06:36.700]  I'm going to take him.
[06:36.840 --> 06:37.560]  I'm going to take him.
[06:37.820 --> 06:38.560]  What's up, Jacobs?
[06:38.920 --> 06:40.680]  Oh, go, Gavin, go.
[06:40.720 --> 06:42.120]  Oh, flying off the side.
[06:43.320 --> 06:44.420]  Go, Gavin, go.
[06:44.920 --> 06:45.860]  All right, I'm going to eat him.
[06:45.960 --> 06:47.220]  I'm going to eat him for brekkie.
[06:47.820 --> 06:49.340]  I can't turn left, good.
[06:50.060 --> 06:51.240]  Oh, Gavin, there you go.
[06:51.720 --> 06:51.920]  Damn it.
[06:52.100 --> 06:52.840]  Oh, you missed.
[06:53.960 --> 06:54.900]  Hard to turn.
[06:55.380 --> 06:56.580]  Hard to turn.
[06:57.620 --> 06:58.620]  You got this thing.
[06:58.940 --> 06:59.080]  Uh-oh.
[06:59.520 --> 06:59.920]  Uh-oh.
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.400]  My legs are through my asshole.
[07:02.940 --> 07:05.580]  Eric, if you go to the camera, you can go free cam.
[07:05.620 --> 07:07.160]  Select camera, go to free cam.
[07:07.180 --> 07:08.440]  And then how do I follow?
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.160]  And then click B once and then scroll to the right and click hide UI.
[07:15.560 --> 07:17.040]  To the right, all the way to the right.
[07:17.400 --> 07:19.140]  Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.120]  It kicked me back.
[07:21.180 --> 07:23.840]  Okay, so once you got a select camera, go free cam.
[07:24.800 --> 07:25.600]  Yeah, no, I did that.
[07:25.860 --> 07:26.860]  Yeah, and now hide them.
[07:27.400 --> 07:28.660]  And now go all the way to the right.
[07:28.940 --> 07:30.380]  Nope, further right to the eye.
[07:30.400 --> 07:31.360]  To this, got it.
[07:31.360 --> 07:32.420]  To the eyeball, the eyeball.
[07:32.500 --> 07:32.820]  That's it.
[07:33.040 --> 07:35.340]  All right, Gavin, take him out.
[07:35.600 --> 07:36.760]  Jacobs, do something.
[07:37.100 --> 07:37.720]  Come on, Jacobs.
[07:37.820 --> 07:38.220]  What are you doing?
[07:38.260 --> 07:39.300]  You look like shit, dude.
[07:39.300 --> 07:41.880]  He might not be able to move.
[07:42.260 --> 07:43.020]  I can't turn.
[07:43.620 --> 07:45.080]  Gavin, Gavin, he's on your tail.
[07:45.180 --> 07:46.320]  Oh, he's coming for you.
[07:46.320 --> 07:46.840]  Gavin!
[07:47.500 --> 07:48.400]  Oh, jeez.
[07:48.540 --> 07:49.520]  What? Oh, no, Jacobs!
[07:52.360 --> 07:53.320]  Where's he gonna spawn?
[07:53.700 --> 07:54.920]  Where's he gonna freaking spawn?
[07:55.920 --> 07:56.840]  I'm gonna sniff you.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.360]  Where are they?
[07:57.660 --> 07:59.580]  Oh, Gavin, I've got my eye on you.
[07:59.820 --> 08:00.700]  Gavin, behind you!
[08:02.120 --> 08:04.000]  Oh my god, he's neck and neck.
[08:04.080 --> 08:04.980]  He's chasing.
[08:08.500 --> 08:09.380]  Oh, Gavin!
[08:10.340 --> 08:11.940]  My thing's still driving.
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.780]  Speed too high, I can't respawn.
[08:14.840 --> 08:15.320]  Okay, here we go.
[08:15.320 --> 08:16.940]  Oh, oh, he's done for.
[08:17.620 --> 08:18.240]  Oh, he's right there.
[08:18.320 --> 08:18.800]  He's right there.
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.260]  He's right there.
[08:19.380 --> 08:19.860]  Head to head.
[08:20.440 --> 08:20.760]  Get him.
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.700]  He lost the wheel.
[08:23.780 --> 08:24.680]  That has to be it.
[08:24.800 --> 08:25.480]  Dude, you got him.
[08:25.780 --> 08:26.240]  There he is, Gavin.
[08:26.640 --> 08:27.320]  Dead ahead.
[08:29.000 --> 08:29.580]  Dead ahead, which?
[08:29.600 --> 08:30.460]  How is this still going?
[08:30.460 --> 08:30.820]  No, no, behind.
[08:31.100 --> 08:31.920]  There you go, left.
[08:32.080 --> 08:33.480]  No, right, right.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.840]  No, okay, now behind you directly.
[08:35.140 --> 08:35.380]  Oh, god.
[08:35.680 --> 08:37.760]  Okay, run, Gavin, run!
[08:38.080 --> 08:38.980]  He's coming for you.
[08:39.420 --> 08:39.980]  Oh, cool.
[08:40.720 --> 08:41.440]  Evasive maneuvers.
[08:41.540 --> 08:44.260]  I'm so bent up, it's impossible to get anywhere.
[08:44.260 --> 08:46.080]  He's in the ground.
[08:46.620 --> 08:47.960]  He's on fire.
[08:49.420 --> 08:51.640]  We got any Jcoop supporters in the chat?
[08:52.960 --> 08:54.140]  What's going on, Jcoops?
[08:54.520 --> 08:57.240]  I've got a ton of Jcoop support.
[08:58.220 --> 08:58.820]  Get him.
[08:59.320 --> 08:59.700]  Come here.
[09:00.120 --> 09:00.620]  Come here, son.
[09:01.180 --> 09:02.440]  Get out of the ground and fight me.
[09:04.020 --> 09:07.760]  For some reason, reversing is making me go forwards better than forwards.
[09:08.580 --> 09:09.900]  This is so funny.
[09:09.920 --> 09:10.880]  Bump him, bump him.
[09:10.940 --> 09:11.260]  Die!
[09:12.260 --> 09:13.440]  Oh, he's reversing.
[09:13.440 --> 09:14.480]  He's evading.
[09:14.780 --> 09:15.780]  Come on, Jcoops.
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.200]  Come on, you old bastard.
[09:17.640 --> 09:18.200]  977.
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.140]  Oh, you're mounting Jcoops.
[09:25.020 --> 09:27.120]  Come on, how do I punch?
[09:29.840 --> 09:30.980]  He's on fire.
[09:31.700 --> 09:33.140]  There you go, you got him, you got him.
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.540]  Oh, Jcoops is getting out of there.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.220]  He's evading.
[09:43.440 --> 09:46.140]  If this is really how a demolition derby was, everyone would leave.
[09:48.060 --> 09:49.540]  He's on fire again.
[09:50.360 --> 09:51.640]  How is he still in this?
[09:53.460 --> 09:54.420]  Oh, nice.
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.760]  Oh, where'd he go?
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.520]  He reset.
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.200]  Where is he?
[09:59.360 --> 09:59.940]  Oh, he's moving.
[10:00.180 --> 10:00.900]  He's got speed.
[10:01.260 --> 10:02.560]  He's got speed, he's going.
[10:04.120 --> 10:05.480]  Gavin, he's coming right for you.
[10:05.980 --> 10:06.740]  Oh, he missed.
[10:07.800 --> 10:09.200]  Yeah, you were too evasive.
[10:09.560 --> 10:10.180]  You're a little cheetah.
[10:12.440 --> 10:13.080]  Get him.
[10:13.080 --> 10:15.300]  Oh, oh, now you missed.
[10:16.900 --> 10:21.000]  Oh, I saw it drive straight at you, leopard skin moron.
[10:21.240 --> 10:21.940]  Come on.
[10:23.840 --> 10:24.620]  Get him.
[10:31.100 --> 10:32.920]  You got him, Gavin, here it comes.
[10:33.120 --> 10:33.300]  You got him.
[10:34.220 --> 10:34.860]  Line it up.
[10:34.900 --> 10:36.000]  Right there, dead ahead.
[10:37.240 --> 10:38.360]  He's not enough speed.
[10:41.560 --> 10:42.940]  Oh, he respawned.
[10:43.900 --> 10:44.880]  He's behind you.
[10:45.320 --> 10:47.600]  Every time he respawns, I can get speed back.
[10:47.800 --> 10:48.120]  Oh, here it is.
[10:48.320 --> 10:48.940]  Oh, this is it.
[10:49.320 --> 10:49.920]  Oh, this is it.
[10:50.560 --> 10:51.280]  This is it.
[10:52.340 --> 10:53.340]  Gavin did it.
[10:53.700 --> 10:54.520]  Gavin wins.
[10:56.580 --> 10:58.000]  What a battle.
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.100]  Wow, that was incredible.
[11:01.500 --> 11:01.720]  What a game.
[11:01.720 --> 11:02.500]  That was awesome.
[11:02.880 --> 11:03.480]  What a game.
[11:04.160 --> 11:06.340]  Do we want to do the same thing, but change the vehicle?
[11:06.700 --> 11:07.140]  Absolutely.
[11:09.060 --> 11:10.020]  You want to do motorhome?
[11:10.680 --> 11:11.600]  Yeah, let's do motorhome.
[11:12.500 --> 11:13.300]  I like it.
[11:13.500 --> 11:14.300]  Yeah, I like that.
[11:15.060 --> 11:15.380]  Motorhome.
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.360]  Moat or home.
[11:18.800 --> 11:20.140]  Let's go to the paint shop.
[11:21.320 --> 11:22.280]  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
[11:22.380 --> 11:23.080]  See if we got any paint.
[11:24.200 --> 11:27.760]  Why do I still have the sofa?
[11:28.560 --> 11:28.860]  What?
[11:29.100 --> 11:30.920]  You can't press B, you gotta press A again.
[11:32.360 --> 11:33.600]  How many times do I have to press A?
[11:34.200 --> 11:34.520]  Multiple.
[11:34.860 --> 11:35.180]  Awful.
[11:35.800 --> 11:37.300]  Man, look at everyone just on top of it.
[11:37.380 --> 11:38.340]  Everyone's motorhome already.
[11:38.520 --> 11:38.940]  That's brilliant.
[11:39.020 --> 11:39.960]  Yeah, everyone's pretty cool.
[11:40.040 --> 11:40.940]  Oh, this one's got dogs?
[11:41.100 --> 11:41.500]  All right, cool.
[11:42.080 --> 11:43.460]  All right, ain't nothing but a hound dog.
[11:43.680 --> 11:44.120]  Here we go.
[11:45.060 --> 11:46.260]  Save paint changes, you fucking know it.
[11:46.300 --> 11:47.260]  I'm ready, let's do it.
[11:47.800 --> 11:48.980]  I'm going for my second win.
[11:50.260 --> 11:50.820]  I'm ready.
[11:51.660 --> 11:52.340]  Oh, man.
[11:52.480 --> 11:53.100]  Let's do this.
[11:54.300 --> 11:55.020]  Yep, huanchachos.
[11:56.940 --> 11:57.640]  I reckon...
[11:57.640 --> 11:58.360]  All right, let's do this thing.
[11:58.400 --> 11:58.640]  Same course.
[11:59.520 --> 12:00.560]  Jcoops' sniffed victory.
[12:00.660 --> 12:01.560]  He's gonna go hard this time.
[12:01.580 --> 12:01.680]  Oh, yeah.
[12:02.000 --> 12:02.820]  Jcoops wants it too.
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.460]  He wants it so fucking bad on this one.
[12:04.860 --> 12:05.640]  He tasted it.
[12:06.120 --> 12:06.860]  He was so close.
[12:08.600 --> 12:10.400]  Oh, shit, me and Andrew are next to each other.
[12:11.100 --> 12:11.980]  Oh, I'm going left.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  Hard left.
[12:13.300 --> 12:13.860]  You're right in front of me?
[12:13.960 --> 12:15.340]  Okay, I see how it is.
[12:16.820 --> 12:17.480]  I want to find Eric.
[12:17.680 --> 12:18.320]  I want to screen time.
[12:20.440 --> 12:21.500]  Oh, my God.
[12:24.260 --> 12:25.320]  Oh, I'm hurting.
[12:25.640 --> 12:26.520]  I'm hurting bad, guys.
[12:26.720 --> 12:26.960]  Gavin!
[12:27.540 --> 12:28.760]  Oh, Andrew, ouch!
[12:29.700 --> 12:30.100]  Cidermane!
[12:30.300 --> 12:30.760]  Oh, no.
[12:31.400 --> 12:32.620]  Andrew, you murdered me.
[12:32.820 --> 12:34.720]  You guys got a convoy going over here.
[12:35.060 --> 12:35.400]  Yeah.
[12:35.780 --> 12:36.500]  Oh, shit.
[12:36.860 --> 12:37.220]  Gavin!
[12:38.400 --> 12:39.340]  Oh, I'm out!
[12:39.440 --> 12:40.180]  I killed myself on it.
[12:40.180 --> 12:40.960]  Dude, I came in eighth.
[12:41.040 --> 12:41.980]  I came in eighth.
[12:41.980 --> 12:43.620]  I came in seventh.
[12:43.640 --> 12:45.840]  Oh, my truck is not doing good in the front.
[12:46.460 --> 12:46.820]  No.
[12:47.340 --> 12:47.780]  Oh.
[12:48.780 --> 12:49.800]  Dude, free cam, fool.
[12:50.460 --> 12:51.600]  Uh, let's, uh...
[12:51.600 --> 12:52.500]  That's a good idea.
[12:52.800 --> 12:54.480]  I was gonna pick someone to follow.
[12:54.620 --> 12:55.440]  Let's just free cam it.
[12:57.320 --> 12:58.980]  Oh, how did I get an assist?
[12:59.220 --> 13:00.060]  I didn't touch anyone.
[13:01.200 --> 13:01.440]  Whatever.
[13:02.040 --> 13:02.860]  Not complaining.
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.080]  Just don't understand it.
[13:04.100 --> 13:05.800]  All right, we got everyone's all bunched up.
[13:05.880 --> 13:07.160]  Oh, there goes Morris off the edge!
[13:08.860 --> 13:09.640]  Reliant, James!
[13:10.480 --> 13:10.920]  Andrew!
[13:11.980 --> 13:13.060]  I was trying to hit him.
[13:13.460 --> 13:13.720]  Oh.
[13:14.340 --> 13:15.400]  Gavin, where'd you go?
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.620]  I died on you.
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.180]  I came in seventh when you came in eighth.
[13:18.460 --> 13:18.860]  Oh, did you?
[13:18.960 --> 13:19.740]  Really? That sucks.
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.120]  Whoa, CiderMane is taking it to the people.
[13:22.500 --> 13:24.720]  Oh, somebody just died smashing at me.
[13:25.280 --> 13:26.220]  We got four left.
[13:27.760 --> 13:28.640]  Reliant, CiderMane!
[13:29.100 --> 13:30.420]  Oh, my God!
[13:30.560 --> 13:31.820]  Off the edge!
[13:33.240 --> 13:33.680]  Wow.
[13:34.800 --> 13:36.300]  Dude, Reliant's going bananas.
[13:36.700 --> 13:37.340]  Come on, come on, come on.
[13:37.900 --> 13:39.820]  Oh, Andrew's sniffing at tips.
[13:40.040 --> 13:40.860]  I'm trying.
[13:40.860 --> 13:42.420]  Trying to get for Jcoop.
[13:42.500 --> 13:43.220]  Tiff's sniffing.
[13:43.760 --> 13:44.440]  I'm going to reset.
[13:45.180 --> 13:46.000]  Here's CiderMane.
[13:48.440 --> 13:49.980]  Head-to-head action!
[13:50.520 --> 13:51.000]  CiderMane!
[13:52.540 --> 13:53.440]  Take that!
[13:56.520 --> 13:57.900]  Hey, let's loop around.
[13:58.240 --> 13:59.240]  Keeping an eye on you.
[13:59.740 --> 14:00.300]  Get the elbow!
[14:02.340 --> 14:02.820]  Almost.
[14:03.120 --> 14:04.260]  Is it down to the final three?
[14:04.660 --> 14:04.920]  Yep.
[14:05.560 --> 14:07.420]  Oh, look at this battle up here at the top.
[14:08.320 --> 14:10.440]  Oh, Tiff tried to go over there.
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.200]  Camera's setting.
[14:12.540 --> 14:14.180]  Oh, come on, come on.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.540]  Might be the final two here.
[14:16.140 --> 14:16.780]  Bring it on!
[14:17.120 --> 14:18.380]  What happened to your vehicle?
[14:18.760 --> 14:20.000]  Oh, what happened to my vehicle?
[14:20.520 --> 14:21.360]  You stole mine!
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.720]  You guys are toast.
[14:24.060 --> 14:24.780]  They're going up to get some speed.
[14:24.780 --> 14:25.860]  He's got nothing left!
[14:25.980 --> 14:26.880]  And then I'm going to loop around.
[14:27.600 --> 14:28.180]  Looping around.
[14:28.300 --> 14:29.060]  Coming right for you!
[14:30.040 --> 14:30.440]  Andrew!
[14:31.220 --> 14:31.620]  Yeah!
[14:33.420 --> 14:34.760]  I own the RV!
[14:36.280 --> 14:37.200]  Huge, big win.
[14:37.920 --> 14:38.640]  Big win.
[14:38.640 --> 14:41.640]  I basically had one crash and I was out.
[14:41.820 --> 14:42.140]  Yeah, me too.
[14:42.480 --> 14:44.400]  And it was into me and we both got eliminated.
[14:45.180 --> 14:49.120]  What I like about this is you both lost your vehicle and your house.
[14:49.220 --> 14:49.700]  You're not homeless.
[14:50.160 --> 14:52.260]  I don't know where I'm going to live.
[14:52.600 --> 14:53.000]  We're done here.
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.740]  Where do we want to go now?
[14:54.800 --> 14:55.360]  What do we want to pick?
[14:56.400 --> 14:58.580]  Let's race and let's put on...
[14:59.260 --> 15:01.160]  Let's keep the motorhomes, but let's race.
[15:01.380 --> 15:02.180]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[15:02.700 --> 15:04.460]  Let me make some options.
[15:05.120 --> 15:06.340]  Let's swap levels.
[15:06.760 --> 15:07.200]  Cool.
[15:07.200 --> 15:08.720]  I like that we both got a win.
[15:10.640 --> 15:12.080]  Do we want to do...
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.260]  What is an elimination race?
[15:16.120 --> 15:18.620]  I think if you're in last in the time trap, it probably kicks you out.
[15:18.640 --> 15:19.180]  That seems fun.
[15:19.220 --> 15:19.760]  You want to do that?
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.000]  Oh, yeah.
[15:21.000 --> 15:21.620]  Yeah, sure, whatever.
[15:21.960 --> 15:23.360]  Like a loser sucks race.
[15:24.060 --> 15:24.140]  Yeah.
[15:25.840 --> 15:26.200]  Okay.
[15:27.000 --> 15:27.620]  All right, here we go.
[15:27.980 --> 15:30.360]  Oh, that's a lot of turns for an RV.
[15:30.920 --> 15:32.160]  For the motorhome.
[15:34.460 --> 15:37.880]  Uh, okay, uh, everyone on motorhome and we can do this thing.
[15:37.880 --> 15:38.980]  All right, let's do it.
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.540]  It's already locked in.
[15:40.700 --> 15:42.560]  Just ready up as soon as you log in.
[15:43.060 --> 15:43.820]  Load in, I guess.
[15:46.220 --> 15:47.780]  Load, load, load, load.
[15:49.400 --> 15:50.540]  Ponchachos are almost there.
[15:51.520 --> 15:52.220]  There you go.
[15:52.340 --> 15:53.260]  Now we're in, baby.
[15:54.480 --> 15:54.920]  Motorhelmets.
[15:58.580 --> 15:59.560]  Come on, Ponchachos.
[15:59.620 --> 15:59.940]  What the hell?
[16:00.180 --> 16:00.900]  There we go.
[16:03.540 --> 16:03.980]  Ponchachos.
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.300]  Are you deliberately saying it a different way?
[16:06.320 --> 16:10.240]  Yeah, I've heard it as Ponchachos one time and I went, oh, that's good.
[16:10.280 --> 16:10.900]  That's his name now.
[16:11.900 --> 16:13.140]  Oh, my God.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.780]  Oh, my God.
[16:15.580 --> 16:16.440]  This is crazy.
[16:16.800 --> 16:17.840]  Get out of the way.
[16:18.280 --> 16:19.180]  I don't want to be last.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.440]  I don't want to be the first one out.
[16:24.980 --> 16:25.760]  Oh, man.
[16:26.360 --> 16:27.320]  Oh, this is bad.
[16:27.560 --> 16:29.320]  I'm holding us up front here.
[16:29.320 --> 16:30.060]  Oh, fuck.
[16:30.060 --> 16:31.190]  For this bloke.
[16:32.680 --> 16:33.700]  Oh, I'm tipping.
[16:34.240 --> 16:34.940]  I'm tipping.
[16:35.260 --> 16:35.820]  Oh, Andrew.
[16:36.100 --> 16:36.340]  I'm tipping.
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.700]  Oh, Andrew.
[16:39.880 --> 16:41.900]  Oh, my God.
[16:42.300 --> 16:42.940]  That was awful.
[16:44.000 --> 16:44.980]  I feel bad about that.
[16:45.780 --> 16:46.680]  We're all bunched up.
[16:46.860 --> 16:51.300]  There we go.
[16:51.380 --> 16:51.880]  We're feeling good.
[16:51.960 --> 16:52.540]  We're feeling good.
[16:53.000 --> 16:53.800]  Gavin, where are you at?
[16:53.820 --> 16:54.320]  You at first?
[16:54.540 --> 16:55.340]  Yeah, I'm at first.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.340]  Oh, freaking hell.
[16:58.420 --> 17:00.380]  Whoa, huge turd fishtail.
[17:00.660 --> 17:02.400]  I need people to crash.
[17:02.480 --> 17:02.920]  I'm in the back.
[17:03.660 --> 17:04.480]  Yeah, I think it's happening.
[17:04.740 --> 17:06.620]  I'm trying to get Jacobs out of here for you, dude.
[17:07.340 --> 17:08.520]  Oh, someone rolled again.
[17:09.020 --> 17:09.620]  Oh, wow.
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.320]  Yeah, Jacobs.
[17:11.840 --> 17:13.380]  Oh, I'm still in the back.
[17:13.680 --> 17:14.460]  I'm in fourth.
[17:15.200 --> 17:16.020]  We've got elimination.
[17:16.520 --> 17:17.740]  No, here it comes.
[17:18.340 --> 17:18.360]  No!
[17:20.840 --> 17:22.700]  Andrew Canton has been eliminated.
[17:23.280 --> 17:25.460]  I was too busy looking at the elimination timer.
[17:27.560 --> 17:31.140]  I cannot wait for you guys to deal with where I got eliminated.
[17:32.420 --> 17:33.880]  Oh, my God!
[17:33.920 --> 17:34.920]  What happened?
[17:35.920 --> 17:36.440]  Wachachos!
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.860]  Oh, oh, Cytomane two-wheeling, edging like a madman.
[17:44.380 --> 17:45.120]  Oh, my God.
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.280]  Jacobs.
[17:46.540 --> 17:48.180]  Oh, Cytomane rolling.
[17:48.760 --> 17:48.960]  I am.
[17:49.640 --> 17:50.880]  Oh, yeah, I am.
[17:51.160 --> 17:53.680]  Oh, man, I did not do what I did on purpose.
[17:54.160 --> 17:56.540]  But boy, am I glad that it worked out that way.
[17:56.540 --> 17:57.500]  I'm excited.
[17:57.800 --> 17:58.760]  Oh, this is gonna be great.
[17:58.760 --> 17:58.900]  Oh, God.
[17:59.100 --> 18:00.480]  Oh, big turn, big turn, big turn.
[18:00.600 --> 18:02.060]  Ah, Jacobs!
[18:04.800 --> 18:05.720]  Oh, he's kicking up behind me.
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.180]  Jacobs is trying to pit maneuver me.
[18:07.380 --> 18:08.580]  Jacobs, you son of a bitch.
[18:10.020 --> 18:10.900]  No, Andrew!
[18:11.180 --> 18:12.100]  That's my wreck!
[18:13.400 --> 18:14.420]  Blocking out Jacobs.
[18:15.100 --> 18:16.540]  It's so dead center.
[18:17.060 --> 18:18.380]  Oh, Gavin rolled!
[18:20.540 --> 18:21.840]  Xloris has been eliminated.
[18:22.400 --> 18:24.620]  Oh, he got eliminated right as he overtook me.
[18:24.680 --> 18:25.100]  That was so unlucky.
[18:25.100 --> 18:26.380]  He was about to overtake.
[18:27.100 --> 18:29.080]  Gavin is way far behind.
[18:29.420 --> 18:31.460]  This sucks.
[18:31.700 --> 18:31.820]  All right.
[18:31.880 --> 18:33.040]  Oh, I'm so out.
[18:33.100 --> 18:34.560]  I'm so freaking out.
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.900]  I respect the idea.
[18:38.740 --> 18:39.920]  I'm just going to get somewhere good.
[18:40.340 --> 18:41.940]  Yeah, I get it.
[18:42.840 --> 18:43.820]  There we go.
[18:44.060 --> 18:44.620]  Big turn.
[18:44.820 --> 18:46.840]  We've created a little bit of a problem over here.
[18:47.300 --> 18:49.260]  Reliant Jables all the way at the front.
[18:49.520 --> 18:50.600]  He's way ahead of me.
[18:53.690 --> 18:55.110]  Oh, yeah, he's doing great.
[18:55.790 --> 18:57.990]  These turns are tough in this thing.
[18:58.690 --> 18:59.650]  Come on.
[18:59.650 --> 19:00.310]  You're holding.
[19:00.590 --> 19:00.910]  Oh, my God.
[19:01.290 --> 19:02.130]  For Eric.
[19:03.130 --> 19:04.510]  Getting everyone's name wrong.
[19:05.630 --> 19:07.170]  I stopped the elimination.
[19:08.390 --> 19:10.230]  What the hell is this?
[19:10.470 --> 19:12.990]  I blocked first place and I can't be eliminated now.
[19:13.010 --> 19:13.750]  What the fuck?
[19:14.070 --> 19:15.410]  Oh, oh.
[19:15.710 --> 19:16.130]  He ghosted through.
[19:16.390 --> 19:17.190]  That was bullshit.
[19:17.990 --> 19:18.990]  Oh, they're ghosting.
[19:19.170 --> 19:20.610]  They're ghosting me out.
[19:21.930 --> 19:23.010]  Jacobs, hurry.
[19:23.570 --> 19:25.170]  Oh, they're pushing my wreck out of the way.
[19:25.190 --> 19:26.250]  I did what I had to do.
[19:26.330 --> 19:27.470]  Gavin has been eliminated.
[19:27.790 --> 19:27.850]  I'm out.
[19:29.470 --> 19:30.530]  Oh, no.
[19:31.730 --> 19:34.090]  Oh, you've trapped Jacobs, Gavin.
[19:34.450 --> 19:36.350]  Once again, stealing their glory.
[19:39.950 --> 19:41.030]  Oh, man.
[19:41.370 --> 19:44.730]  I mean, this is a really a two person race at the moment.
[19:44.990 --> 19:45.710]  Yeah, big time.
[19:45.910 --> 19:47.130]  Can Eric catch up?
[19:47.390 --> 19:49.750]  No, I'm like five seconds behind this guy.
[19:50.790 --> 19:51.530]  There's no way.
[19:52.810 --> 19:54.790]  This takes one bad crash.
[19:54.790 --> 19:57.610]  To those in the chat, we're watching Eric.
[19:58.190 --> 19:58.650]  Yeah.
[19:59.210 --> 20:00.790]  In the red motorhome.
[20:01.530 --> 20:02.930]  I gotta get in there.
[20:03.010 --> 20:04.070]  I gotta get closer.
[20:04.650 --> 20:07.010]  I've been racing a good race, but goddamn.
[20:07.650 --> 20:09.650]  I think Cidermane is like right behind me, too.
[20:11.270 --> 20:13.430]  No, he's about the same distance.
[20:14.150 --> 20:14.390]  Yeah.
[20:14.490 --> 20:15.090]  You to first.
[20:16.150 --> 20:17.030]  Oh, my God.
[20:17.150 --> 20:18.290]  Oh, my God.
[20:18.470 --> 20:20.530]  Oh, he's gonna catch up now.
[20:20.750 --> 20:21.610]  I'm wrecked.
[20:21.830 --> 20:22.650]  Why am I wrecked?
[20:23.590 --> 20:25.070]  Eric is out.
[20:25.210 --> 20:26.370]  TNF, is it over?
[20:27.970 --> 20:29.010]  I wrecked.
[20:29.090 --> 20:31.850]  Now it's all it's huge lead for Reliant.
[20:35.510 --> 20:36.450]  Cidermane is in the contest.
[20:37.830 --> 20:39.110]  How did my car?
[20:39.510 --> 20:40.490]  Oh, my God.
[20:40.490 --> 20:41.390]  You guys fucked me.
[20:41.510 --> 20:42.550]  You guys fucked me.
[20:42.790 --> 20:44.850]  We made a pretty nasty pile, I'll be honest.
[20:44.890 --> 20:47.070]  Yeah, it's quite the barricade we got going.
[20:49.050 --> 20:50.430]  Oh, Reliant is going in for the win.
[20:50.550 --> 20:51.050]  I agree.
[20:51.590 --> 20:52.330]  King Kale knows.
[20:56.340 --> 20:58.840]  Dude, Reliant is just like cruising.
[20:59.280 --> 21:00.480]  Miles ahead of everybody.
[21:00.640 --> 21:01.240]  Like it's nothing.
[21:02.060 --> 21:02.360]  Just cruising.
[21:02.440 --> 21:04.400]  How's he going to get past all our trash, though?
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.740]  I'm about to find out.
[21:07.100 --> 21:07.980]  I'm excited to see it.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.240]  Because I wrecked right here, too.
[21:09.440 --> 21:11.560]  Oh, what a navigating move.
[21:11.700 --> 21:13.240]  Professionally, just like it was nothing.
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.080]  Slowed down, going across the finish for the big win.
[21:18.680 --> 21:19.200]  Bam.
[21:20.840 --> 21:22.060]  What a finish.
[21:23.000 --> 21:23.380]  That's it.
[21:23.680 --> 21:24.180]  Dead last.
[21:24.180 --> 21:24.940]  Look at me.
[21:29.700 --> 21:31.820]  Oh, man, that was great.
[21:32.020 --> 21:34.080]  Why don't we do the same thing?
[21:34.140 --> 21:37.140]  But let's swap to either the couches or the lawnmower.
[21:37.540 --> 21:38.620]  Oh, yeah, lawnmower.
[21:38.820 --> 21:39.520]  Let's do the lawnmower.
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.780]  OK, let's get the lawn guy.
[21:41.580 --> 21:42.220]  Yeah, I like that.
[21:42.560 --> 21:43.420]  Gavin's a big lawn guy.
[21:43.460 --> 21:44.360]  He should have an edge.
[21:44.720 --> 21:45.020]  I was.
[21:45.100 --> 21:46.020]  My lawnmower broke.
[21:46.560 --> 21:47.580]  Oh, no, really?
[21:47.960 --> 21:48.180]  Yeah.
[21:48.180 --> 21:48.740]  Did it really?
[21:49.140 --> 21:49.340]  Yeah.
[21:49.380 --> 21:49.880]  That's crazy.
[21:50.080 --> 21:50.720]  I'll talk about it.
[21:51.640 --> 21:52.040]  That's...
[21:52.040 --> 21:53.240]  Is it a podcast talk?
[21:53.240 --> 21:53.940]  Yeah.
[21:54.740 --> 21:55.100]  Nice.
[21:55.960 --> 21:56.440]  Hang on.
[21:56.940 --> 21:58.100]  I'm just making some adjustments here.
[22:02.800 --> 22:06.040]  I don't think that did shit.
[22:07.160 --> 22:07.740]  Looks good.
[22:08.960 --> 22:11.300]  We'll do one more race and then we'll see if I can...
[22:11.720 --> 22:13.040]  Swap out some people and stuff?
[22:13.160 --> 22:13.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.940]  I'll swap out people afterwards.
[22:15.460 --> 22:18.040]  Is this the appropriate time to tell people if they want to watch this on Tuesday,
[22:18.180 --> 22:19.960]  they can watch it over on the Regulation Gameplay channel?
[22:20.080 --> 22:21.020]  I think it's a great time.
[22:21.520 --> 22:22.240]  Whenever you want, man.
[22:23.240 --> 22:23.940]  Oh, is that right?
[22:31.550 --> 22:33.270]  Uh, do I want to do anything with the paint?
[22:33.690 --> 22:34.050]  Good.
[22:37.820 --> 22:41.120]  Guys, if you're watching this live, you can go and watch this on Tuesday
[22:41.120 --> 22:43.300]  when it comes out on the Regulation Gameplay channel.
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.720]  You leave a comment, let us know who you think should have won,
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.580]  if it was Jcoops or Wanchachos.
[22:48.120 --> 22:52.040]  Why always Jcoops got an A-level lawnmower from?
[22:52.140 --> 22:53.900]  I don't know, but he's gonna fucking blow us out of the water.
[22:54.000 --> 22:54.500]  He sucks.
[22:56.100 --> 22:57.720]  Real jerk, that Jcoops.
[22:59.900 --> 23:00.260]  Yep.
[23:00.880 --> 23:01.600]  Who's not ready?
[23:01.820 --> 23:02.540]  XMorris, what the hell?
[23:02.680 --> 23:03.040]  Come on.
[23:03.040 --> 23:03.920]  Come on, Ryan Jables.
[23:05.460 --> 23:05.780]  Jables.
[23:08.140 --> 23:09.060]  No, Jcoops is...
[23:09.060 --> 23:09.420]  All right.
[23:09.740 --> 23:10.240]  Okay, here we go.
[23:10.380 --> 23:10.920]  Jcoops, you're fucking toast.
[23:11.380 --> 23:12.380]  I like my positioning.
[23:13.240 --> 23:14.360]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:14.540 --> 23:15.400]  XMorris, what the hell?
[23:16.940 --> 23:17.660]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:19.220 --> 23:19.740]  Oh, wow.
[23:19.780 --> 23:22.060]  These turn way different from the last thing.
[23:22.580 --> 23:24.940]  I'm trading paint with Andrew, thankfully with the same color.
[23:25.000 --> 23:25.900]  Oh, I'm getting pushed.
[23:26.260 --> 23:26.660]  I'm getting pushed.
[23:27.100 --> 23:27.460]  Oh, my God.
[23:27.800 --> 23:28.720]  Oh, my God.
[23:28.720 --> 23:29.720]  Oh, my God.
[23:29.720 --> 23:31.280]  Oh, my God.
[23:31.720 --> 23:32.960]  That was horrible.
[23:33.640 --> 23:34.680]  I'm out.
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.640]  How are you out already?
[23:37.920 --> 23:38.860]  I'm out.
[23:40.700 --> 23:41.940]  What the hell?
[23:42.180 --> 23:43.240]  You have to free cam again.
[23:43.900 --> 23:45.240]  There's too many people just to follow one.
[23:45.260 --> 23:46.940]  All right, I'm following Andrew because I can see Gavin also.
[23:48.280 --> 23:48.780]  Are you up?
[23:48.900 --> 23:49.340]  Who's first?
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.100]  Someone's way up ahead.
[23:52.100 --> 23:52.660]  Andrew is zipping.
[23:54.920 --> 23:56.080]  He's zipping us all.
[23:56.820 --> 23:57.000]  Yep.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.740]  Oh, like the guy streaming is always the first out.
[24:04.020 --> 24:05.280]  I just don't understand.
[24:05.440 --> 24:06.680]  I don't know how I didn't finish.
[24:06.840 --> 24:08.280]  Everyone was bumping into everyone.
[24:08.420 --> 24:10.520]  And then all of a sudden it was like, oh, yeah, you're wrecked.
[24:10.600 --> 24:13.560]  And it's like, well, everyone just wrecked in front of me.
[24:13.860 --> 24:14.680]  Jcoops is out.
[24:15.740 --> 24:17.020]  Oh, Jcoops, no.
[24:18.920 --> 24:20.380]  Coming for you, Morris.
[24:21.880 --> 24:23.320]  Oh, I just dinged myself.
[24:23.340 --> 24:24.800]  Oh, Gavin just saw that happen.
[24:25.200 --> 24:26.160]  Oh, there goes Andrew.
[24:27.120 --> 24:28.700]  Oh, Gavin on his tail.
[24:29.420 --> 24:30.540]  Oh, is this Andrew here?
[24:30.640 --> 24:31.260]  I see him.
[24:31.640 --> 24:32.380]  I see him.
[24:32.880 --> 24:36.080]  The one right in front of you is Reliant Jables.
[24:36.460 --> 24:37.060]  And then you get right there.
[24:37.180 --> 24:37.720]  Oh, Gavin.
[24:37.980 --> 24:38.820]  Oh, Gavin.
[24:39.200 --> 24:39.580]  Trees.
[24:41.060 --> 24:43.720]  Oh, Gavin, you might be getting eliminated here, bud.
[24:44.060 --> 24:44.820]  Uh, I might.
[24:45.140 --> 24:45.800]  That might be happening.
[24:46.240 --> 24:47.860]  I need someone to scoff some shit.
[24:47.940 --> 24:49.280]  Oh, I see someone else behind me.
[24:51.360 --> 24:51.960]  Oh, no.
[24:52.720 --> 24:53.160]  No!
[24:53.760 --> 24:54.060]  No!
[24:55.160 --> 24:55.760]  Come on, Gavin.
[24:56.040 --> 24:56.300]  Come on!
[25:00.720 --> 25:02.960]  Oh, did Andrew just fall off the track?
[25:03.040 --> 25:04.400]  Oh my god, they're right next to each other.
[25:06.180 --> 25:07.960]  Oh, Gavin's been eliminated.
[25:10.460 --> 25:11.880]  Andrew's still in this thing.
[25:12.620 --> 25:15.720]  I tried to jump across the track and it did not like it.
[25:16.100 --> 25:16.920]  Uh, don't do that.
[25:18.100 --> 25:18.680]  It was pretty cool.
[25:18.980 --> 25:20.500]  I was just mowing the lawn back there.
[25:21.100 --> 25:21.320]  Yeah.
[25:23.440 --> 25:25.040]  That was my fastest lap yet.
[25:25.120 --> 25:25.400]  Come on, Andrew.
[25:25.500 --> 25:26.060]  You're patting around.
[25:26.140 --> 25:26.660]  You're doing great.
[25:26.900 --> 25:28.160]  I'm trying my best to catch him.
[25:28.160 --> 25:30.920]  All your wheels are on the same spot.
[25:31.340 --> 25:32.600]  He's a motorcycle.
[25:33.760 --> 25:34.440]  Catch him.
[25:34.980 --> 25:37.140]  What's a quad-wheeled motorcycle called?
[25:37.600 --> 25:38.840]  They're all in line.
[25:39.100 --> 25:40.440]  It's like an inline skate.
[25:43.800 --> 25:45.420]  It's like a one wheel but four.
[25:45.940 --> 25:47.440]  It really is.
[25:48.240 --> 25:49.700]  It's just a tiny car.
[25:50.360 --> 25:50.520]  Yeah.
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.340]  How long until you're eliminated here, bud?
[25:52.420 --> 25:53.840]  Oh my god, you're still in this thing!
[25:53.840 --> 25:55.000]  We're still in it!
[25:56.120 --> 25:56.320]  Oh!
[25:56.320 --> 25:58.740]  Oh, wait, that's dead Gavin.
[25:58.900 --> 25:59.160]  Shit!
[25:59.540 --> 26:00.920]  Oh, there goes Andrew.
[26:01.480 --> 26:03.540]  You're still in your car, so you tricked me.
[26:04.100 --> 26:04.220]  Yep.
[26:04.820 --> 26:05.960]  Reliant just blew it.
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.140]  There goes X-Morris.
[26:07.700 --> 26:08.780]  Cidermane on his tail.
[26:09.200 --> 26:10.300]  I love when you get eliminated.
[26:10.420 --> 26:12.000]  It looks like you've been sniped.
[26:14.460 --> 26:16.540]  Cidermane is right on the tail of X-Morris.
[26:16.680 --> 26:16.880]  Right there.
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.980]  Oh no, going to the outside.
[26:18.140 --> 26:18.520]  Too far!
[26:19.600 --> 26:20.480]  Oh, Cidermane!
[26:20.700 --> 26:22.460]  Did he go flying off?
[26:22.680 --> 26:24.160]  Oh, Cidermane.
[26:24.440 --> 26:25.760]  Way off the edge.
[26:29.980 --> 26:31.500]  Dude, Wreckfest is awesome.
[26:31.620 --> 26:32.400]  This game is too funny.
[26:32.560 --> 26:34.300]  I am so happy that they just-
[26:34.300 --> 26:34.740]  Oh no!
[26:34.880 --> 26:35.740]  Look at Cider-
[26:35.740 --> 26:36.660]  Oh, Cidermane is-
[26:36.660 --> 26:37.140]  He can't drive.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.100]  He's too messed up.
[26:38.120 --> 26:38.680]  Cidermane can't go.
[26:39.960 --> 26:40.760]  Oh, Cidermane.
[26:42.460 --> 26:43.540]  Oh, he's turning around!
[26:43.880 --> 26:44.360]  X-Morris is on fire.
[26:44.440 --> 26:45.700]  Oh, Cidermane, no.
[26:46.160 --> 26:47.160]  Cidermane is going to get flung.
[26:47.300 --> 26:47.760]  Oh, he-
[26:47.760 --> 26:49.220]  Yeah, just got lapped.
[26:50.140 --> 26:52.540]  Rinala, 10 gifted.
[26:52.740 --> 26:53.560]  Thank you so much.
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.120]  Oh my god.
[26:54.120 --> 26:54.680]  Thank you.
[26:55.760 --> 26:56.600]  Yeah, he's just hanging out.
[26:56.700 --> 26:57.440]  Oh, there he goes.
[26:57.440 --> 26:59.200]  That man watched another man die.
[26:59.400 --> 27:00.180]  Yeah, absolutely.
[27:00.900 --> 27:01.680]  And his hive is...
[27:04.400 --> 27:06.080]  That's a lot of gifted subs.
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.260]  It is.
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.180]  Rinala, thank you.
[27:08.200 --> 27:08.660]  10 gifted.
[27:08.860 --> 27:09.440]  Appreciate it.
[27:09.540 --> 27:11.460]  Appreciate you guys coming through on a Friday.
[27:11.620 --> 27:14.000]  This is a great way to kind of clock out for the week.
[27:14.200 --> 27:15.140]  This is a fun time.
[27:15.480 --> 27:16.820]  As we approach 5.01.
[27:17.460 --> 27:19.000]  Yeah, the best time.
[27:19.240 --> 27:20.120]  I might crack a cold one.
[27:21.320 --> 27:22.120]  Uh-oh, Rel-
[27:22.120 --> 27:22.800]  Oh no, Reliant!
[27:22.800 --> 27:23.700]  Reliant crashed!
[27:24.040 --> 27:24.700]  Oh no!
[27:25.040 --> 27:25.920]  Reliant's on wheels!
[27:27.840 --> 27:30.260]  He might have to go in reverse the rest of the way.
[27:30.540 --> 27:31.240]  Oh no!
[27:32.380 --> 27:32.960]  Oh no!
[27:33.460 --> 27:34.100]  Morris is gating!
[27:35.560 --> 27:37.020]  Oh, he's managed it.
[27:37.160 --> 27:37.940]  Oh, look at that.
[27:38.240 --> 27:40.000]  He's doing it.
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.680]  Oh, it's ugly, but he's going.
[27:42.860 --> 27:44.260]  Morris definitely has more speed.
[27:45.140 --> 27:47.040]  Is Morris gonna make it before he's eliminated?
[27:47.260 --> 27:50.120]  Oh, he's gonna limp across the finish, it looks like.
[27:50.760 --> 27:51.660]  Smart trying!
[27:53.120 --> 27:54.660]  And he gets it!
[27:57.820 --> 28:00.340]  Ex-Morris is on their tail.
[28:01.400 --> 28:03.140]  He can't close the gap though.
[28:03.440 --> 28:03.920]  Oh!
[28:05.540 --> 28:06.620]  Ex-Morris has done it.
[28:07.300 --> 28:07.780]  Congratulations.
[28:08.900 --> 28:09.860]  Great games.
[28:10.760 --> 28:12.940]  Thank you so much to everyone who joined us.
[28:13.100 --> 28:13.760]  I am going to-
[28:13.760 --> 28:14.400]  Yeah, that was awesome.
[28:14.580 --> 28:16.400]  Let's swap in for some new blood.
[28:16.740 --> 28:17.860]  Swap in some new people.
[28:18.420 --> 28:21.080]  Yeah, thank you guys so much for jumping on.
[28:21.340 --> 28:24.000]  I love playing these kinds of games with the community.
[28:24.100 --> 28:24.940]  It's a fucking blast.
[28:25.520 --> 28:26.300]  This is so much fun.
[28:26.300 --> 28:33.200]  And now, while we get new blood in, this is where Gavin is going to keep us entertained
[28:33.200 --> 28:35.820]  as a classic streamer, the way he is.
[28:35.860 --> 28:37.040]  So Gavin, take it away.
[28:37.240 --> 28:37.680]  I'll be right back.
[28:38.400 --> 28:39.660]  What? Huh?
[28:40.260 --> 28:41.000]  What happened?
[28:45.720 --> 28:51.280]  I was talking to Michael last night and I was saying that we've been playing heists and stuff
[28:51.280 --> 28:54.520]  and it's a bunch of comments going,
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.000]  it's really weird watching Gavin be the best one at video games
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.940]  after years of that not being the case.
[29:01.800 --> 29:04.500]  It's also because I always had the shittiest stuff.
[29:05.120 --> 29:07.540]  I probably had the least money put on my account.
[29:09.180 --> 29:12.240]  Now, in comparison to you guys, I've got everything.
[29:12.480 --> 29:13.480]  Oh, you have everything.
[29:13.480 --> 29:14.060]  I've got gold miniguns.
[29:14.260 --> 29:15.240]  You've got the coolest shit.
[29:15.960 --> 29:17.260]  Your stuff's awesome.
[29:17.420 --> 29:18.840]  I'm level 41.
[29:19.540 --> 29:21.200]  Your shit's all cool as shit.
[29:21.340 --> 29:22.540]  It's so fucking crazy.
[29:22.540 --> 29:27.980]  I think Michael and Ray were over level 100 like the week online came out.
[29:28.040 --> 29:29.360]  Oh, yeah. Oh, I don't doubt it.
[29:29.840 --> 29:32.020]  Hey, Andrew, did you, uh, leave?
[29:32.760 --> 29:33.040]  No.
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.360]  I'm here with Eric and Sabby Boy.
[29:36.520 --> 29:37.540]  Oh, there, okay, there it is.
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.560]  Andrew's back. Andrew's back. Andrew's back.
[29:39.880 --> 29:40.920]  All right, let's look at these names.
[29:41.060 --> 29:43.260]  Who do we think's got the best chance?
[29:43.760 --> 29:48.380]  Saddy Boy, Slim Chance, Christophicus, Spummer.
[29:48.900 --> 29:52.280]  Honestly, me personally, I'm a Spummer head.
[29:53.380 --> 29:54.700]  Sabby Boy and Spummer.
[29:55.740 --> 29:59.440]  Yeah, um, let's do, do you guys have, do you guys have the Harvester?
[30:00.180 --> 30:00.540]  Yeah.
[30:00.960 --> 30:01.320]  Yeah.
[30:01.460 --> 30:04.060]  Can we do the Harvester? Can we do a Demolition Derby with it?
[30:04.340 --> 30:05.020]  Totally, yeah.
[30:05.560 --> 30:05.900]  There we go.
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.540]  All right, guys, jump, if you can, jump on that Harvester.
[30:11.200 --> 30:11.920]  Uh, okay.
[30:12.600 --> 30:14.500]  Where are all the Spumheads in the chat?
[30:14.600 --> 30:15.740]  We got Spumheads right now?
[30:16.140 --> 30:17.100]  Oh, Sir Peppermint.
[30:21.080 --> 30:21.800]  Sir Peppermint.
[30:26.090 --> 30:27.290]  Haha, that's funny.
[30:28.510 --> 30:29.290]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[30:31.290 --> 30:31.690]  Spummer.
[30:32.330 --> 30:33.990]  Yeah, dude, you big Spummer head.
[30:34.790 --> 30:36.330]  I'm gonna see his gamer card.
[30:37.650 --> 30:38.310]  Okay, there we go.
[30:38.710 --> 30:39.610]  That's what I'm looking for.
[30:40.530 --> 30:41.330]  Uh, okay.
[30:43.570 --> 30:45.930]  Okay, I am, okay, we all getting on Harvester.
[30:45.970 --> 30:48.150]  Sir Peppermint, you better, Sir Peppermint.
[30:48.710 --> 30:49.110]  What happened?
[30:49.690 --> 30:51.890]  I'm just letting him do the Demolition, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:51.890 --> 30:53.090]  So it's fine, yeah.
[30:53.290 --> 30:53.810]  Are you guys ready?
[30:53.810 --> 30:55.450]  Are you guys in for a Spummer bummer?
[30:58.130 --> 31:00.010]  Mocking, mockingbird, that's fucking great.
[31:01.770 --> 31:03.630]  Uh, Spummer of 98.
[31:11.240 --> 31:13.260]  Oh man, the boys of Spummer.
[31:15.880 --> 31:17.340]  All right, I'm ready.
[31:18.640 --> 31:19.140]  Dude.
[31:19.920 --> 31:20.740]  Ready and up.
[31:20.760 --> 31:21.260]  Where are all the Spumheads at?
[31:21.400 --> 31:22.260]  Ready as chuff.
[31:22.380 --> 31:22.860]  Here we go.
[31:23.100 --> 31:23.440]  All right.
[31:24.580 --> 31:25.480]  Oh my god.
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.300]  What have you done?
[31:28.060 --> 31:30.780]  There's a freaking car park before the game starts.
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.220]  Oh my god.
[31:36.800 --> 31:37.840]  Grinding it up.
[31:38.880 --> 31:39.800]  Oh, Christopher Cue.
[31:39.880 --> 31:41.000]  Oh, there you get him, Spummer.
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.280]  Save me, Spummer.
[31:42.920 --> 31:45.380]  Dude, my controller is vibrating like a slag.
[31:45.760 --> 31:46.540]  Oh, I'm dipping.
[31:47.480 --> 31:49.100]  Dude, Spummer, what the fuck?
[31:50.420 --> 31:51.820]  All right, Spummer, you're fucking dead.
[31:52.080 --> 31:52.920]  Oh, I got Spummed.
[31:53.400 --> 31:53.940]  Oh no.
[31:55.040 --> 31:55.600]  Die, Spummer.
[31:56.340 --> 31:56.860]  No.
[32:00.060 --> 32:01.480]  Oh, this is so much fun.
[32:01.940 --> 32:03.340]  Oh my god, this is crazy.
[32:03.520 --> 32:03.820]  Spummer!
[32:04.340 --> 32:04.760]  Go for it.
[32:05.000 --> 32:05.960]  Ah, I missed.
[32:06.160 --> 32:06.420]  Fuck.
[32:08.900 --> 32:10.020]  No, I tipped.
[32:10.920 --> 32:11.880]  Eric's two-wheeling.
[32:13.520 --> 32:14.980]  These things have so much health.
[32:17.140 --> 32:17.660]  Oh.
[32:18.080 --> 32:18.600]  Oh.
[32:19.040 --> 32:20.100]  Oh my god.
[32:20.400 --> 32:20.800]  Oh, I got wrecked.
[32:21.600 --> 32:22.120]  Madness.
[32:22.220 --> 32:23.920]  It's madness in the middle.
[32:24.420 --> 32:25.440]  Oh, Eric, reset.
[32:25.440 --> 32:26.460]  What a baby.
[32:27.200 --> 32:27.460]  Had to.
[32:27.540 --> 32:28.280]  Had to get out of there.
[32:28.440 --> 32:29.300]  Had to.
[32:29.720 --> 32:30.300]  Had to.
[32:30.400 --> 32:31.080]  Had no choice.
[32:31.380 --> 32:32.420]  Oh, very slim chances.
[32:32.520 --> 32:33.000]  Absolutely.
[32:33.260 --> 32:34.120]  I was getting Spummed.
[32:34.380 --> 32:36.320]  He's getting fucking Spummed, dude.
[32:36.840 --> 32:37.140]  No!
[32:38.040 --> 32:39.140]  Eat corner, son.
[32:39.660 --> 32:40.620]  Oh my god.
[32:40.960 --> 32:42.300]  Oh my god, no.
[32:42.680 --> 32:43.740]  I got no wheels.
[32:44.300 --> 32:45.400]  I got no wheels.
[32:45.960 --> 32:47.020]  I can't go nowhere.
[32:49.040 --> 32:49.560]  No!
[32:49.980 --> 32:51.020]  He was coming for me.
[32:52.820 --> 32:54.880]  I've genuinely lost one of my wheels.
[32:54.880 --> 32:56.120]  Oh, me too.
[32:56.260 --> 32:56.720]  Big time.
[32:56.820 --> 32:57.160]  Where's Spummer?
[32:57.560 --> 32:58.860]  Oh, I'm barely moving.
[32:59.200 --> 33:00.200]  Oh, here we go.
[33:00.600 --> 33:01.720]  Oh, I'm coming in hot.
[33:02.380 --> 33:05.520]  Oh, you shed a little piece of something.
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.440]  Oh, I got nothing left.
[33:07.540 --> 33:08.880]  My gearbox is damaged, dude.
[33:12.000 --> 33:14.060]  I've still got some speed on these wheels.
[33:14.260 --> 33:14.680]  Where's Spummer?
[33:14.680 --> 33:15.480]  Is Spummer out?
[33:15.860 --> 33:18.060]  No, Spummer just got tipped in the middle.
[33:18.240 --> 33:18.960]  Oh, Spummer.
[33:19.380 --> 33:20.540]  Oh, Spummer, you fool.
[33:21.380 --> 33:22.200]  Oh my god.
[33:22.400 --> 33:24.300]  Very slim chances rolling me.
[33:25.380 --> 33:26.820]  Oh my god.
[33:26.820 --> 33:27.800]  I can't reset.
[33:27.820 --> 33:28.780]  I'm going too fast.
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.780]  Oh, I got body slammed.
[33:31.120 --> 33:32.380]  It won't let me reset.
[33:32.820 --> 33:34.160]  Oh my god.
[33:34.840 --> 33:35.680]  Brat Spummer.
[33:38.600 --> 33:40.260]  That's the colors you've got.
[33:43.300 --> 33:44.340]  I can't.
[33:44.800 --> 33:46.620]  Oh, I'm totally upside down.
[33:46.640 --> 33:46.820]  Oh, Spummer in the back.
[33:46.980 --> 33:47.600]  Spummer in the back.
[33:48.860 --> 33:50.040]  Die, Spummer, die.
[33:50.880 --> 33:52.200]  Somebody come get Spummer.
[33:54.160 --> 33:55.840]  Die, mother Spummer, die, mother.
[34:00.400 --> 34:01.920]  You got Spummed.
[34:03.000 --> 34:04.500]  Spummed to death, eighth place.
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.980]  I just... somebody kill me.
[34:08.820 --> 34:12.680]  Oh my god, I just noticed I had somebody's body in the back of my...
[34:12.680 --> 34:13.240]  Oh, is that me?
[34:13.940 --> 34:14.500]  I think so.
[34:14.520 --> 34:15.200]  Are you escorting me?
[34:15.700 --> 34:16.260]  I think I was.
[34:16.380 --> 34:16.500]  Die, Spummer.
[34:17.280 --> 34:17.840]  Oh no.
[34:17.840 --> 34:26.220]  Oh, I'm dead.
[34:28.320 --> 34:29.860]  Sir Peppermint, no.
[34:32.460 --> 34:34.040]  We should do a race in these.
[34:34.680 --> 34:35.220]  Oh, absolutely.
[34:35.500 --> 34:36.020]  Absolutely.
[34:36.300 --> 34:37.180]  I think that's next.
[34:38.860 --> 34:39.380]  100%.
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.060]  Okay.
[34:40.460 --> 34:41.320]  Hang on, I'm backing up.
[34:41.780 --> 34:42.680]  Hang on, I'm backing up.
[34:44.260 --> 34:45.700]  Very slim chance, you fool.
[34:48.220 --> 34:48.880]  Backing up.
[34:50.320 --> 34:52.380]  Oh, oh, slim chance is coming back.
[34:52.460 --> 34:52.780]  Oh no.
[34:53.680 --> 34:55.460]  I... oh, I just wrecked someone.
[34:56.360 --> 34:57.300]  Yeah, baby.
[34:58.740 --> 34:59.420]  That's right, guys.
[34:59.440 --> 35:00.280]  I have one.
[35:00.320 --> 35:02.140]  I have one wheel in the front.
[35:03.420 --> 35:04.210]  Spummer was going...
[35:04.640 --> 35:04.780]  Oh no.
[35:05.100 --> 35:06.740]  Oh, savvy boy.
[35:10.080 --> 35:12.360]  That wasn't very brat Spummer of you.
[35:14.360 --> 35:16.400]  Spummer getting bullied by the savvy boy.
[35:16.640 --> 35:17.060]  Good.
[35:17.060 --> 35:18.120]  Bullied Spummer.
[35:18.400 --> 35:20.780]  Oh, very slim chance takes Eric out.
[35:21.560 --> 35:22.320]  I wrecked.
[35:23.120 --> 35:23.960]  All right, hang on.
[35:24.080 --> 35:24.700]  I gotta follow.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.900]  I gotta follow Spummer.
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.000]  Four people left by the looks of it.
[35:30.260 --> 35:32.380]  Oh, pretty much everyone besides us.
[35:32.380 --> 35:34.120]  Does that eliminate two people that hit the head?
[35:34.740 --> 35:35.380]  All right, let's see.
[35:35.820 --> 35:36.940]  It might be final two now.
[35:37.220 --> 35:38.460]  Spummer and Sir Peppermint.
[35:39.040 --> 35:41.180]  Oh, Sir Peppermint, huge tip over.
[35:42.320 --> 35:42.980]  Here comes Spummer.
[35:43.380 --> 35:45.400]  We're on the ground in the mess.
[35:45.400 --> 35:48.100]  We're following Spummer as he tips.
[35:48.180 --> 35:49.300]  No, what a save.
[35:49.820 --> 35:51.380]  Sir Peppermint on his heels.
[35:51.560 --> 35:53.400]  Oh, Peppermint navigating through the line.
[35:54.040 --> 35:55.220]  Oh my God, Spummer.
[35:57.580 --> 35:58.800]  Spummer and Peppermint.
[35:58.940 --> 36:00.820]  Chipping off every piece of every dead guy.
[36:01.440 --> 36:02.280]  Oh my God.
[36:02.460 --> 36:03.280]  Oh, and he missed.
[36:04.280 --> 36:04.700]  What a turn.
[36:04.980 --> 36:06.200]  A bummer for Spummer.
[36:06.880 --> 36:08.660]  And Sir Peppermint is still in this thing.
[36:09.580 --> 36:10.560]  He's so smashed in.
[36:10.640 --> 36:11.440]  It looks like a bike.
[36:12.700 --> 36:13.840]  Head to head.
[36:14.640 --> 36:15.600]  Spummer wins!
[36:16.140 --> 36:17.000]  Spummer with the win.
[36:19.660 --> 36:20.560]  What a way to end.
[36:20.560 --> 36:22.680]  We're in our Spummer era, clearly.
[36:24.620 --> 36:26.620]  Let's swap to a race level.
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.580]  How did you find Spummer, Andrew?
[36:29.940 --> 36:31.220]  It's just messages.
[36:32.380 --> 36:33.660]  Spummer found me, Gavin.
[36:33.720 --> 36:34.560]  You don't find Spummer.
[36:35.040 --> 36:36.260]  Yeah, you don't find Spummer.
[36:36.420 --> 36:37.380]  Spummer finds you, bro.
[36:38.420 --> 36:40.960]  Okay, let's do same cars, but let's do a race.
[36:43.880 --> 36:45.080]  Spummer lovin'.
[36:47.020 --> 36:50.720]  Claire Pothole saying Spummer lovin'.
[36:52.940 --> 36:55.100]  We got some Spummer of 69.
[36:58.540 --> 36:59.520]  Oh my God.
[37:04.000 --> 37:04.800]  I'm a dude.
[37:04.900 --> 37:06.300]  I'm a Spum head, no doubt.
[37:07.520 --> 37:09.620]  Spummer just messaged me, best day ever.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.400]  His name is Spummer.
[37:18.640 --> 37:19.280]  Oh, fuck.
[37:19.940 --> 37:21.320]  Elimination race again.
[37:21.860 --> 37:22.520]  Let's do it.
[37:23.520 --> 37:25.800]  Oh, oh, I'm in the front this time.
[37:27.100 --> 37:29.300]  Now when I fuck up, everyone can see.
[37:29.640 --> 37:30.700]  Nobody moved.
[37:30.960 --> 37:32.020]  Why didn't anybody move?
[37:32.260 --> 37:33.140]  I'm flying.
[37:33.540 --> 37:35.700]  I want to know who in chat's got money on the Spum this game.
[37:36.180 --> 37:37.520]  Who's in front of me?
[37:37.820 --> 37:38.880]  Who is this?
[37:39.100 --> 37:40.380]  You son of a bitch.
[37:40.380 --> 37:42.240]  Who's tipped over in the front?
[37:42.400 --> 37:43.400]  It's Spummer.
[37:44.380 --> 37:46.360]  I got Spum fucked.
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.600]  I got Spum fucked.
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.660]  No, I'm tipping over.
[37:53.780 --> 37:55.360]  This is, I'm in hell.
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.480]  I'm in Spummer hell.
[38:00.800 --> 38:02.880]  Spummer, you son of a bitch.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.900]  Oh, this is easy for me being in the front.
[38:09.900 --> 38:11.340]  I got nobody to bump.
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.140]  I just got to maintain the lead.
[38:19.100 --> 38:20.220]  Oh, my God.
[38:20.580 --> 38:22.280]  I can see you, but I can't catch up.
[38:23.540 --> 38:24.900]  You still Spum fucked, Eric?
[38:24.980 --> 38:25.380]  Are you in the back?
[38:25.380 --> 38:26.260]  No, I was.
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.560]  I don't think I'm in last anymore.
[38:27.700 --> 38:29.140]  I'm about to get Spum fucked.
[38:30.480 --> 38:33.100]  I'm trying to catch up to Spummer so I can fuck him.
[38:38.820 --> 38:41.040]  I don't know what era we're in.
[38:44.320 --> 38:45.280]  Uh-oh.
[38:45.940 --> 38:47.360]  I got Savvy Boy on my ass.
[38:47.820 --> 38:48.440]  Oh, no.
[38:50.900 --> 38:51.380]  Elimination.
[38:52.100 --> 38:52.800]  Oh, no.
[38:53.220 --> 38:53.580]  Coming up.
[38:53.660 --> 38:54.440]  Very slim chance.
[38:54.520 --> 38:55.460]  Looks like they're getting out.
[38:56.440 --> 38:57.400]  Who's it gonna be?
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.080]  Very slim chance has been eliminated, which is bad news for Eric, who's in seventh place.
[39:05.640 --> 39:07.440]  After getting Spum fucked.
[39:09.100 --> 39:11.400]  Oh, I crashed in the exact same place.
[39:11.540 --> 39:12.060]  What an idiot.
[39:15.660 --> 39:16.480]  Come on.
[39:16.580 --> 39:17.560]  That was rough.
[39:17.800 --> 39:19.120]  I crashed into the man.
[39:19.360 --> 39:20.380]  I'm stuck on the bloke.
[39:21.040 --> 39:22.040]  You're stuck on the guy?
[39:22.320 --> 39:22.840]  The bloke's got me.
[39:22.900 --> 39:23.580]  Good, stay there.
[39:23.620 --> 39:24.900]  Let me go, you idiot.
[39:25.400 --> 39:26.280]  Come on.
[39:26.820 --> 39:29.660]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[39:30.080 --> 39:30.860]  Get out of the way.
[39:31.100 --> 39:32.080]  You get eliminated.
[39:32.720 --> 39:33.220]  No!
[39:34.900 --> 39:35.400]  No!
[39:38.580 --> 39:40.420]  Oh, fuck, I spun out.
[39:40.740 --> 39:41.860]  Sir Peppermint!
[39:42.420 --> 39:43.140]  You spummed out?
[39:43.880 --> 39:46.060]  I, I, I spummed out.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.520]  This is an endless spummer.
[39:52.980 --> 39:53.540]  This sucks.
[39:54.820 --> 39:56.440]  This spummer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.
[40:00.620 --> 40:01.740]  Oh, all right.
[40:01.900 --> 40:03.140]  Big turn, big turn, big turn.
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.960]  Not in seventh, not in seventh.
[40:07.120 --> 40:07.860]  Oh, my God.
[40:08.980 --> 40:10.580]  I think Sir Peppermint just got fucked.
[40:14.970 --> 40:15.530]  Idiot!
[40:15.670 --> 40:17.070]  Gavin, Gavin, is that you?
[40:17.270 --> 40:18.050]  You fool.
[40:19.390 --> 40:20.650]  It's a cruel spummer.
[40:23.110 --> 40:23.590]  No!
[40:24.010 --> 40:25.490]  Oh, Sir Peppermint is out.
[40:26.310 --> 40:26.950]  I'm some...
[40:26.950 --> 40:27.470]  No!
[40:29.130 --> 40:29.690]  Yes!
[40:34.450 --> 40:35.550]  Oh, my God.
[40:36.090 --> 40:37.230]  What the fuck is this?
[40:37.390 --> 40:37.950]  What is this?
[40:38.010 --> 40:38.370]  No!
[40:39.450 --> 40:40.490]  This can't be...
[40:50.620 --> 40:51.900]  Getting spummed.
[40:52.200 --> 40:53.200]  Are you getting spummed?
[40:53.200 --> 40:55.360]  I got spummed against the railings.
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.760]  Oh, my God.
[41:00.440 --> 41:01.580]  Oh, my God.
[41:02.320 --> 41:05.960]  I'm, I'm 34 seconds behind first place.
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.280]  I'm really, I'm just hanging on for dear life right now.
[41:12.360 --> 41:13.360]  I'm not in last.
[41:14.460 --> 41:16.460]  I think Spum's about to go.
[41:18.780 --> 41:19.600]  You think Spum...
[41:19.600 --> 41:21.100]  Oh, because you're right behind me.
[41:21.280 --> 41:21.440]  Yes!
[41:21.560 --> 41:22.160]  You're in fifth.
[41:22.520 --> 41:22.700]  Yeah.
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.200]  Oh, man.
[41:23.340 --> 41:24.060]  That's what I needed.
[41:27.260 --> 41:27.660]  Yes!
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.360]  Oh, he spun out.
[41:29.780 --> 41:30.500]  Took the lead again.
[41:30.580 --> 41:31.100]  He spummed out?
[41:31.300 --> 41:31.500]  He spummed.
[41:31.760 --> 41:32.540]  He spummed out.
[41:37.320 --> 41:38.680]  Eric, come here, you little prick.
[41:39.300 --> 41:42.340]  We need to remember when we have to get the metadata for this.
[41:42.400 --> 41:43.060]  Like, what's the title?
[41:43.160 --> 41:44.100]  It's Boys of Spummer.
[41:44.460 --> 41:46.160]  I definitely don't want to forget that.
[41:46.500 --> 41:47.460]  I don't want to forget that.
[41:48.180 --> 41:50.600]  Spummer has been eliminated.
[41:50.860 --> 41:51.700]  There he goes.
[41:51.900 --> 41:54.020]  A bummer for Spummer.
[41:54.820 --> 41:56.180]  Oh, shit.
[41:57.900 --> 41:58.980]  Shit butt.
[42:00.980 --> 42:03.320]  Gavin is 30 seconds behind me.
[42:03.460 --> 42:05.140]  I'm 40 seconds behind Andrew.
[42:07.980 --> 42:09.260]  Oh, fuck.
[42:10.880 --> 42:12.200]  Oh, I'm getting...
[42:12.200 --> 42:13.120]  Oh, he's gaining on me.
[42:13.740 --> 42:14.900]  Oh, he's right on the tail.
[42:15.160 --> 42:15.340]  No!
[42:15.340 --> 42:15.560]  No!
[42:16.980 --> 42:17.780]  Fuck off!
[42:17.900 --> 42:18.320]  Oh, Andrew.
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.700]  Savvy boy is right there.
[42:22.920 --> 42:23.660]  Oh, fuck.
[42:23.660 --> 42:25.000]  Gavin is still in this thing.
[42:25.100 --> 42:26.780]  Gavin is a full minute behind me.
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.320]  Oh, I'm getting hit.
[42:32.060 --> 42:33.060]  Gavin, I think you need to...
[42:33.060 --> 42:34.360]  I think you need to change your game plan.
[42:34.980 --> 42:38.380]  No, Gavin had a very clear game plan and it worked pretty well.
[42:39.160 --> 42:41.140]  Oh, was he doing some Spummer stuff?
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.520]  Oh, he was doing some dark Spummer stuff.
[42:43.520 --> 42:46.280]  Yeah, he was doing dark Spummer stuff.
[42:46.520 --> 42:47.620]  Oh, no!
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.080]  Oh, no!
[42:49.800 --> 42:50.460]  No!
[42:53.420 --> 42:55.360]  I tipped over.
[42:55.940 --> 42:56.180]  Stop.
[43:00.420 --> 43:02.220]  Get me out of here.
[43:02.660 --> 43:04.520]  You smell what Gavin was Spumming?
[43:04.620 --> 43:05.220]  Get away.
[43:05.400 --> 43:06.960]  Get away from me.
[43:07.800 --> 43:08.800]  Get eliminated.
[43:09.000 --> 43:09.660]  Go to hell.
[43:14.120 --> 43:14.840]  Oh, man.
[43:19.160 --> 43:21.060]  I tried to take a shortcut, I didn't like that.
[43:21.340 --> 43:22.180]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[43:22.220 --> 43:24.500]  I am... I'm a full minute behind Andrew.
[43:25.460 --> 43:27.120]  You did the exact same thing as me.
[43:27.160 --> 43:30.260]  I tried to take that shortcut, I got slow for it, and then I just turned around.
[43:30.860 --> 43:31.360]  Yep, yeah.
[43:32.200 --> 43:34.080]  It seems like that's the way you should go.
[43:34.220 --> 43:36.400]  It seems like, oh yeah, this is classically a shortcut.
[43:36.720 --> 43:37.560]  And it's, uh, it's not.
[43:37.800 --> 43:38.080]  It's not.
[43:40.940 --> 43:41.660]  You know what?
[43:42.300 --> 43:43.120]  It's Spum time.
[43:44.120 --> 43:44.480]  Yeah?
[43:45.940 --> 43:46.600]  What does that mean?
[43:48.500 --> 43:50.020]  I think we all know what that means.
[43:50.580 --> 43:51.900]  Yeah, we're Spumming.
[43:52.020 --> 43:52.300]  Oh.
[43:53.740 --> 43:55.980]  Oh, wow, it really doesn't want you to go backwards, huh?
[43:56.980 --> 43:57.320]  No.
[43:57.420 --> 43:58.420]  Oh, no.
[43:58.820 --> 43:59.760]  It's slow prog.
[44:01.600 --> 44:02.040]  No.
[44:03.820 --> 44:04.260]  No.
[44:06.220 --> 44:07.100]  Eric, no.
[44:08.500 --> 44:10.440]  No, I was in first.
[44:10.740 --> 44:12.180]  I was doing so good.
[44:12.540 --> 44:13.940]  Andrew, did you just get Spummed?
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.120]  I got Spummed out.
[44:16.640 --> 44:17.120]  Oh.
[44:18.820 --> 44:20.300]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[44:20.940 --> 44:21.700]  Why, what's wrong?
[44:21.780 --> 44:22.000]  What happened?
[44:22.000 --> 44:22.600]  I was winning.
[44:23.320 --> 44:24.440]  It's Spummer time.
[44:24.820 --> 44:26.000]  I was gonna bring it home.
[44:27.460 --> 44:28.780]  It's not coming home.
[44:29.100 --> 44:30.040]  Oh, no.
[44:30.660 --> 44:32.340]  Oh, Andrew might get to watch Eric die.
[44:33.480 --> 44:35.220]  Oh, yeah, I'm just gonna enjoy this.
[44:35.300 --> 44:36.320]  I'm 20 seconds behind.
[44:37.080 --> 44:37.980]  I'm gonna like this.
[44:39.420 --> 44:41.900]  All my wheels don't even touch the ground anymore.
[44:43.140 --> 44:44.660]  It's only three at a time.
[44:46.700 --> 44:47.680]  Oh, Andrew.
[44:51.140 --> 44:52.560]  He's just beating me up.
[44:52.820 --> 44:53.540]  I don't even have a car.
[44:53.740 --> 44:54.640]  I'm not even there anymore.
[44:55.200 --> 44:56.080]  Ah, you're going.
[44:56.740 --> 44:59.520]  Even in death, you're not doing what I need.
[45:00.940 --> 45:03.060]  Is he like speed bumping you?
[45:03.480 --> 45:04.380]  He's stuck.
[45:04.580 --> 45:06.240]  He doesn't have a front right tire.
[45:07.680 --> 45:11.040]  I don't have a front right tire and my back left is in the air.
[45:12.140 --> 45:13.820]  I'm on two tires, essentially.
[45:14.820 --> 45:15.980]  Oh, my God.
[45:16.040 --> 45:17.060]  All right, here he comes.
[45:18.360 --> 45:19.980]  You can only turn.
[45:20.540 --> 45:21.680]  You can only turn left.
[45:24.100 --> 45:26.020]  Dude, remember when you were in first?
[45:26.120 --> 45:26.440]  What happened?
[45:26.700 --> 45:27.620]  Oh, that was great.
[45:29.100 --> 45:30.600]  I could see the victory.
[45:33.220 --> 45:33.520]  OK.
[45:35.640 --> 45:36.860]  And the spammer.
[45:37.020 --> 45:38.940]  Oh, no, you missed.
[45:39.080 --> 45:40.120]  You missed.
[45:40.220 --> 45:41.460]  Not you missed this one.
[45:41.460 --> 45:42.560]  Ah, you got him.
[45:43.020 --> 45:43.140]  You got him.
[45:43.140 --> 45:44.100]  You got Christophicus.
[45:46.800 --> 45:47.340]  Victory.
[45:51.160 --> 45:52.600]  They're coming for revenge.
[45:52.980 --> 45:54.020]  They're getting revenge.
[45:54.380 --> 45:55.000]  Oh, no.
[45:55.420 --> 45:56.040]  Oh, no.
[45:56.280 --> 45:58.020]  He's going to Christophicus you out.
[46:00.120 --> 46:03.820]  In the spammer time when the weather's fine.
[46:06.320 --> 46:07.400]  Oh, my God.
[46:07.900 --> 46:08.940]  Oh, it's Christophicus.
[46:09.040 --> 46:09.820]  You got to take out Andrew.
[46:10.460 --> 46:11.540]  Oh, he's already out.
[46:11.620 --> 46:12.340]  Andrew got eliminated.
[46:13.040 --> 46:13.540]  Yeah.
[46:14.760 --> 46:15.900]  Who could have guessed?
[46:17.260 --> 46:19.520]  Christophicus, it's time for you to go spammer style.
[46:21.420 --> 46:23.220]  Man, Savvy Boy untouched.
[46:23.400 --> 46:24.660]  Just reaming through the front.
[46:24.840 --> 46:27.680]  I mean, just look at how clean Savvy Boy's car is.
[46:28.560 --> 46:29.660]  Still got the wheels.
[46:30.540 --> 46:33.380]  You got to get in the road, Christophicus.
[46:34.040 --> 46:34.540]  Christophicus.
[46:35.220 --> 46:35.720]  Christofucius.
[46:38.340 --> 46:39.660]  Savvy Boy is cruising.
[46:39.660 --> 46:42.260]  Yeah, he's just he's running into the fucking pole.
[46:42.840 --> 46:44.120]  He's trying to off himself.
[46:49.450 --> 46:50.690]  Come on, where's the head?
[46:50.770 --> 46:51.330]  Oh, here it comes.
[46:51.550 --> 46:52.690]  Here comes the head to head.
[46:57.070 --> 46:57.870]  Oh, impact.
[46:59.630 --> 47:03.010]  Oh, Savvy Boy is dragging Christophicus to the finish.
[47:05.410 --> 47:06.490]  He's coming with me.
[47:06.690 --> 47:07.690]  Carrying him like a backpack.
[47:10.030 --> 47:11.550]  Oh, that's going to be some signage.
[47:11.550 --> 47:13.430]  Oh, my God.
[47:15.210 --> 47:17.870]  I like Savvy Boy blowing away from all the shrapnel.
[47:18.430 --> 47:19.810]  Gavin, you created a...
[47:19.810 --> 47:21.550]  Oh, Savvy Boy with the roll.
[47:22.750 --> 47:24.050]  Christophicus, can you get a second blow?
[47:24.250 --> 47:25.090]  No, they're moving.
[47:25.490 --> 47:27.430]  Gavin, you set a trend when you got eliminated,
[47:27.570 --> 47:31.490]  that every car after you would just turn around and go backwards trying to hit.
[47:33.370 --> 47:37.250]  Dude, that was, that was spammed out.
[47:39.510 --> 47:42.110]  Savvy Boy making the turn for the final stretch.
[47:42.390 --> 47:44.050]  Yeah, bringing in the glory.
[47:44.190 --> 47:45.630]  You can smell the rubber.
[47:46.030 --> 47:46.390]  Yeah.
[47:46.910 --> 47:50.050]  Oh, greater than the final crash.
[47:50.690 --> 47:51.430]  Oh, he's drift.
[47:51.570 --> 47:53.450]  He's rolling, he's rolling.
[47:55.530 --> 47:56.730]  He's so close.
[47:58.190 --> 47:59.370]  Oh, he might have to do a reset.
[47:59.830 --> 48:02.970]  He's stuck resetting as a ghost car.
[48:03.310 --> 48:05.950]  He crosses the finish.
[48:06.110 --> 48:06.750]  He did it.
[48:07.470 --> 48:08.790]  Savvy Boy did it.
[48:09.330 --> 48:11.230]  Christophicus just flies off in the background.
[48:13.110 --> 48:17.010]  I say we got time for one more Demolition Derby.
[48:17.090 --> 48:17.690]  How does that sound?
[48:18.130 --> 48:19.370]  So you want to do it in car?
[48:20.210 --> 48:21.150]  Yeah, let's do car.
[48:21.310 --> 48:22.870]  Let's do, let's find a classic car.
[48:23.290 --> 48:23.550]  Okay.
[48:24.190 --> 48:29.610]  You want to go with rocket or gremlin or what are you thinking, Gavin?
[48:30.310 --> 48:32.210]  Yeah, Bobat's just classic rocket.
[48:32.750 --> 48:33.190]  Rocket?
[48:33.410 --> 48:34.290]  All right, rocket it is.
[48:34.910 --> 48:36.190]  Guys, switch it over.
[48:36.310 --> 48:36.970]  Rocket time.
[48:37.130 --> 48:39.230]  And we're going to be doing Demolition Derby stylies.
[48:39.730 --> 48:42.310]  This is the end of the stream.
[48:42.450 --> 48:44.150]  This is how we wrap it all up.
[48:44.330 --> 48:46.390]  Guys, if you want to watch this later, you can.
[48:46.450 --> 48:49.150]  You can watch it on the Regulation Gameplay channel.
[48:49.410 --> 48:55.870]  It's going to be a lot of fun to go through and see all the bummer of spummer and everything
[48:55.870 --> 48:56.570]  that's happened here.
[48:56.910 --> 49:01.410]  So that was a really smart place to say that, Eric, as we draw to an end.
[49:01.930 --> 49:02.590]  Thanks, man.
[49:03.110 --> 49:03.910]  Appreciate that.
[49:05.290 --> 49:05.990]  It's great.
[49:07.610 --> 49:08.410]  Let's do this.
[49:08.830 --> 49:09.310]  Oh, you know what?
[49:09.370 --> 49:09.930]  I do like this.
[49:11.290 --> 49:11.670]  Here.
[49:13.250 --> 49:13.650]  Yeah.
[49:15.870 --> 49:16.270]  Okay.
[49:16.950 --> 49:17.410]  Safe paint.
[49:18.190 --> 49:18.670]  All right, guys.
[49:18.710 --> 49:20.170]  The Rocket Demolition Derby.
[49:20.470 --> 49:22.090]  This is the way we're going to finish it out.
[49:22.250 --> 49:22.610]  I can't wait.
[49:22.650 --> 49:22.890]  Here we go.
[49:23.250 --> 49:23.710]  I'm excited.
[49:25.470 --> 49:26.630]  In the Madman Stadium.
[49:28.050 --> 49:29.290]  Can Spummer do it?
[49:29.430 --> 49:31.110]  Can Spummer do the impossible?
[49:34.590 --> 49:37.330]  I think Spummer is going to have some friend requests after this.
[49:37.690 --> 49:39.570]  Oh, dude, everyone wants to play with Spummer.
[49:41.390 --> 49:43.170]  Spummer for world leader.
[49:49.230 --> 49:50.030]  All right.
[49:50.230 --> 49:53.190]  We got very slim chance changing their car and then we're good to go.
[49:53.610 --> 49:54.510]  We're ready for it.
[49:55.230 --> 49:56.350]  Let's do this thing, guys.
[49:56.390 --> 49:57.150]  This is how we go out.
[49:57.230 --> 49:58.990]  Last man standing, Spummer style.
[49:59.750 --> 50:00.370]  Oh, I don't even see it.
[50:00.450 --> 50:01.510]  Oh, everyone's like...
[50:07.280 --> 50:08.080]  Oh, shit.
[50:08.360 --> 50:08.780]  Can't get anybody.
[50:09.540 --> 50:10.760]  I'm going up.
[50:12.620 --> 50:13.820]  Oh, shit.
[50:14.120 --> 50:15.360]  Oh, yeah, you can climb the sides.
[50:17.700 --> 50:19.120]  I only damage me.
[50:20.620 --> 50:21.720]  I'm on the wall.
[50:22.860 --> 50:23.100]  Yeah.
[50:25.300 --> 50:25.900]  Oh.
[50:27.220 --> 50:27.960]  Oh, shit.
[50:28.040 --> 50:28.740]  Breaks damage.
[50:28.920 --> 50:29.200]  That's fine.
[50:29.460 --> 50:30.660]  I just...
[50:30.660 --> 50:32.160]  I just fucking flip Spummer, baby.
[50:32.160 --> 50:33.380]  I'm already wrecked.
[50:33.840 --> 50:34.700]  Are you really?
[50:35.100 --> 50:36.080]  I'm dead.
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.080]  Eighth place.
[50:38.080 --> 50:39.360]  Oh, shit.
[50:39.440 --> 50:40.960]  I wrecked myself on the ceiling.
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.880]  That's... I think, yeah, the ceiling does a lot of damage.
[50:43.900 --> 50:44.080]  Boom, got him.
[50:45.040 --> 50:46.180]  Sir Peppermint toast.
[50:47.100 --> 50:48.660]  We still got Spummer in it.
[50:48.680 --> 50:49.700]  Oh, I can't believe I missed him.
[50:52.680 --> 50:54.800]  Christophicus is in the tiniest little car.
[50:57.040 --> 50:57.920]  Sir Peppermint!
[50:58.420 --> 51:00.900]  Oh, how are you still both alive?
[51:03.420 --> 51:04.500]  Spummer coming up the rear.
[51:04.800 --> 51:06.160]  Yeah, it was a tag team.
[51:06.420 --> 51:07.820]  Me and Spummer tag team in it.
[51:08.080 --> 51:09.240]  I'm missing a tire.
[51:12.820 --> 51:13.260]  Spummer!
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.440]  Oh, you're rinsed.
[51:18.340 --> 51:20.900]  I got two tires in the back and that's it.
[51:22.140 --> 51:23.180]  You got half a car.
[51:23.520 --> 51:25.380]  Oh, Savvy Boy's looking real narrow.
[51:25.740 --> 51:26.980]  Oh, Spummer's...
[51:26.980 --> 51:27.620]  Oh, God.
[51:28.080 --> 51:28.400]  Uh-oh.
[51:28.760 --> 51:29.200]  Uh-oh.
[51:29.620 --> 51:30.640]  Oh, Gavin, what do I do?
[51:31.800 --> 51:32.240]  Reset.
[51:32.860 --> 51:34.920]  Savvy Boy looks like he's in a light cycle.
[51:35.580 --> 51:35.740]  All right.
[51:35.780 --> 51:37.820]  You just look like the back half of a car.
[51:38.080 --> 51:39.080]  Nobody hit me.
[51:39.180 --> 51:40.280]  Everyone be nice to me.
[51:40.360 --> 51:41.180]  Spummer, no!
[51:41.400 --> 51:42.380]  Look how short you are.
[51:42.400 --> 51:42.480]  Ah!
[51:46.280 --> 51:47.360]  I'm on fire.
[51:47.760 --> 51:48.680]  I'm on fire!
[51:51.100 --> 51:51.920]  Oh, no.
[51:52.560 --> 51:53.520]  No one's coming for...
[51:53.520 --> 51:54.480]  Dude, they don't even know I'm here.
[51:54.720 --> 51:56.260]  I'm gonna win this whole thing just by hanging out.
[51:56.700 --> 51:57.660]  They don't even know I'm here.
[51:57.960 --> 51:59.060]  You're in your back seats.
[51:59.440 --> 52:00.660]  They have no idea.
[52:00.920 --> 52:01.680]  No, Spummer!
[52:02.480 --> 52:03.880]  Oh, my God.
[52:04.800 --> 52:06.280]  How are you still alive?
[52:06.280 --> 52:07.280]  You're still alive?
[52:07.280 --> 52:09.600]  I'm still in this baby.
[52:12.180 --> 52:14.480]  Wait, look, it's Savvy Boy.
[52:14.700 --> 52:15.660]  Oh, now I'm wrecked.
[52:16.040 --> 52:16.860]  That got me.
[52:17.220 --> 52:18.020]  That got me.
[52:18.940 --> 52:19.140]  Oh.
[52:19.680 --> 52:20.980]  I think you wrecked each other.
[52:21.580 --> 52:22.540]  Wait, wait.
[52:22.640 --> 52:23.400]  I'm still in!
[52:25.280 --> 52:27.680]  Savvy Boy wrecked.
[52:27.740 --> 52:28.620]  I'm still in it.
[52:29.460 --> 52:30.520]  No, Spummer!
[52:32.140 --> 52:35.840]  You can't phase back in because you're stuck on Savvy Boy.
[52:35.840 --> 52:37.300]  I can't move.
[52:37.700 --> 52:40.380]  You're just hiding on Savvy Boy's corpse.
[52:40.960 --> 52:42.560]  I can't move.
[52:47.780 --> 52:49.800]  Oh, no, they brought you back.
[52:49.880 --> 52:50.820]  Oh, you've been cleared.
[52:51.460 --> 52:53.880]  Oh, they're tank teaming.
[52:54.480 --> 52:55.840]  No, no, no, no, no!
[52:56.360 --> 52:56.740]  Go!
[52:57.040 --> 52:57.700]  Eric, run!
[52:58.060 --> 52:58.680]  Run, Eric!
[52:59.060 --> 53:00.640]  Andrew, get everything I got!
[53:00.680 --> 53:01.440]  Go, Eric!
[53:02.160 --> 53:02.640]  Spummer!
[53:03.440 --> 53:06.780]  Oh, you got slammed and double slammed!
[53:06.780 --> 53:09.360]  You're still alive!
[53:09.560 --> 53:10.440]  I'm still in it!
[53:10.980 --> 53:12.020]  You're all bent up.
[53:12.460 --> 53:14.320]  And you're all warped in there.
[53:16.920 --> 53:18.400]  Stop moving for a sec.
[53:20.340 --> 53:21.980]  You gotta pan your camera around.
[53:27.920 --> 53:29.340]  He can't get me.
[53:29.540 --> 53:30.540]  Spummer can't steer.
[53:30.820 --> 53:31.740]  He can't turn.
[53:32.820 --> 53:33.820]  Oh, man.
[53:37.720 --> 53:39.720]  I'm giving it everything I got, Gavin.
[53:41.360 --> 53:43.120]  Here comes Spummer.
[53:43.420 --> 53:44.820]  He's using the wall to turn around.
[53:45.000 --> 53:45.340]  That's smart.
[53:45.680 --> 53:45.840]  No!
[53:47.540 --> 53:49.000]  I'm still in it!
[53:49.220 --> 53:50.880]  I'm still in it!
[53:53.640 --> 53:56.080]  You look like you're sucking your own legs in there.
[53:56.500 --> 53:58.380]  I'm faster than ever.
[53:59.060 --> 53:59.800]  Here comes Spummer.
[53:59.800 --> 54:00.600]  He's coming again.
[54:02.520 --> 54:05.400]  Oh, I'm still in it.
[54:06.780 --> 54:08.420]  I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[54:08.500 --> 54:10.100]  Like, what's the geometry of your body?
[54:13.860 --> 54:15.720]  Like a crushed spider.
[54:19.160 --> 54:21.560]  Spummer... Spummer's got nothing left.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.740]  He's just slow crawling over.
[54:27.040 --> 54:29.940]  I've been holding the gas this whole time!
[54:31.700 --> 54:33.420]  He's lining up for another hit!
[54:36.780 --> 54:37.620]  Here he comes!
[54:41.180 --> 54:43.620]  He just loses his wheel!
[54:44.000 --> 54:44.120]  No.
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.100]  You can see me turning the wheel!
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.620]  It's two crushed up soda cans slowly moving at each other.
[54:51.780 --> 54:54.160]  My car was like three times the size when I went out.
[54:55.940 --> 54:58.400]  I can almost start moving again.
[54:58.540 --> 54:59.160]  Oh, oh!
[54:59.920 --> 55:00.420]  Hang on.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.720]  I'm getting, I'm getting a little bit, hang on.
[55:02.720 --> 55:06.100]  He keeps trying to re-sport you and he keeps stopping.
[55:08.440 --> 55:09.780]  Here he comes!
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.700]  He just taps you and you both burst into flames.
[55:18.380 --> 55:19.800]  Oh, double reset for speed.
[55:20.240 --> 55:21.520]  Yep, yep, for speed.
[55:21.860 --> 55:22.780]  Immediately stops.
[55:27.760 --> 55:30.460]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna shit my pants.
[55:35.330 --> 55:36.670]  We're out of juice.
[55:37.430 --> 55:38.930]  Come and get it, you son of a bitch.
[55:43.570 --> 55:46.750]  Just keep resetting and tapping yourselves to death.
[55:52.570 --> 55:55.350]  Neither one of us is going fast enough.
[55:57.410 --> 55:57.690]  Oh.
[55:59.010 --> 56:00.510]  Oh my god.
[56:01.470 --> 56:02.630]  Oh, finish!
[56:02.770 --> 56:03.710]  It's over, you won!
[56:03.830 --> 56:04.590]  I win!
[56:04.590 --> 56:06.570]  I win, I win!
[56:08.590 --> 56:09.190]  Yes!
[56:10.510 --> 56:11.110]  Insane.
[56:11.350 --> 56:13.330]  Oh, I did it!
[56:14.150 --> 56:15.890]  You got skitspammed.
[56:19.690 --> 56:20.770]  Oh man.
[56:20.930 --> 56:21.810]  Oh my god.
[56:22.030 --> 56:23.150]  Oh my god.
[56:24.970 --> 56:27.150]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[56:27.350 --> 56:29.490]  I cannot, that was the craziest shit in the world.
[56:29.770 --> 56:30.950]  That rocked so hard.
[56:31.430 --> 56:33.050]  Oh my god guys, thank you.
[56:34.590 --> 56:35.690]  Thank you for everyone who came.
[56:35.810 --> 56:37.190]  Thank you for everyone watching live.
[56:37.690 --> 56:39.390]  You can watch this VOD on Tuesday.
[56:39.690 --> 56:40.670]  You can clip out Spummer.
[56:41.190 --> 56:42.550]  You can have a Spummer-Summer.
[56:43.630 --> 56:44.770]  I'm feeling insane.
[56:45.410 --> 56:47.410]  Oh my god, I need to like, lay down.
[56:48.130 --> 56:51.870]  To all the piss rats, to all the corn cats, thank you guys so much for coming out.
[56:52.430 --> 56:53.850]  This has been really great.
[56:54.630 --> 56:55.270]  Enjoy 5.01.
[56:55.270 --> 56:57.930]  And we have a, go, it's just, you know what?
[56:58.030 --> 56:59.130]  Do you want to take it to 5.01?
[56:59.370 --> 57:00.210]  Let's take it to 5.01.
[57:00.670 --> 57:01.370]  Let's do it.
[57:01.450 --> 57:02.790]  5.01's quitting time, guys.
[57:02.950 --> 57:04.350]  And that's, I'm feeling good about it.
[57:04.590 --> 57:07.250]  Why don't you stop the stream at exactly 5.01?
[57:07.670 --> 57:08.710]  That sounds good to me.
[57:09.090 --> 57:09.870]  I'm, I'm down.
[57:10.090 --> 57:13.510]  We got, we got about a minute and a half left.
[57:14.170 --> 57:16.290]  So, hey, it's five o'clock somewhere, guys.
[57:16.370 --> 57:17.070]  You know how it goes.
[57:18.610 --> 57:20.130]  Oh my god, I feel fucking nuts.
[57:20.130 --> 57:22.210]  I'm gonna send Spummer a friend request in this last minute.
[57:22.570 --> 57:23.310]  Oh, hell yeah, dude.
[57:23.550 --> 57:30.250]  Yeah, you gotta get, you gotta get Spummer, you gotta get Spummer going, dude.
[57:34.590 --> 57:37.690]  I hope he signs on every time I record from this point on.
[57:39.830 --> 57:41.090]  Spummer is joined.
[57:42.250 --> 57:44.050]  Oh fuck, Spummer's on the line.
[57:48.310 --> 57:49.550]  Oh my god.
[57:49.950 --> 57:51.610]  Oh fuck, this is so good.
[57:51.810 --> 57:56.270]  Guys, don't forget to go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[57:56.790 --> 58:00.570]  Go sign up there for some bonus content, the stuff we have over there and everything.
[58:00.730 --> 58:01.350]  Keep up to date.
[58:01.430 --> 58:02.970]  It's sort of like why we treat a website, so.
[58:02.970 --> 58:05.310]  We got some great supplementals that have gone up recently.
[58:05.410 --> 58:08.230]  I think the summer activities, did that just go up?
[58:08.450 --> 58:10.390]  Oh yeah, I think you won that, Gavin.
[58:10.930 --> 58:12.290]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[58:12.290 --> 58:13.930]  Hell yeah, my first win.
[58:14.970 --> 58:15.450]  Congratulations.
[58:16.750 --> 58:19.210]  Guys, we are down to the last 40 seconds.
[58:20.010 --> 58:24.250]  It's five o'clock somewhere, and it's just about time to end this.
[58:27.320 --> 58:31.040]  We all just sound like we lost our minds halfway into the stream.
[58:32.120 --> 58:34.260]  We got derailed by a game of Tekken.
[58:35.540 --> 58:37.040]  5-0 Spum.
[58:39.740 --> 58:41.720]  Oh my god, thank you everyone watching.
[58:42.180 --> 58:44.380]  Thank you to Spummer specifically, guys.
[58:44.440 --> 58:45.460]  Give it up for Spummer.
[58:45.800 --> 58:46.920]  Leave a Spum in a comment.
[58:47.120 --> 58:48.260]  We'll see you guys next time.
[58:48.920 --> 58:50.920]  We are signing off.
[58:51.220 --> 58:53.420]  Regulation podcast, Eric, Andrew, Gavin.
[58:53.580 --> 58:54.280]  And we'll see you next time.
[58:54.380 --> 58:54.660]  Bye.
[58:55.320 --> 58:55.360]  Bye.
