[00:00.000 --> 00:03.160]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay.
[00:03.260 --> 00:04.440]  We're checking out Grounded 2.
[00:04.560 --> 00:07.620]  Xbox was kind enough to give us early access so we could check things out.
[00:08.140 --> 00:12.120]  I'm so excited to share this with my good friend, my best bud,
[00:12.580 --> 00:15.100]  the other grounded person on our crew, Geoff.
[00:15.340 --> 00:15.960]  How are you doing?
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.080]  I'm excited, man.
[00:17.200 --> 00:20.800]  I just got into Grounded 1 through the Truck Boys
[00:21.500 --> 00:25.780]  maybe three months ago, and I put like 15 quick hours into it
[00:25.780 --> 00:28.940]  and then I get distracted by Roadcraft, but I'm very excited to see
[00:29.540 --> 00:31.300]  what the sequel has to offer.
[00:32.120 --> 00:34.940]  It's cool when you load in immediately, you agree with the screen of like
[00:34.940 --> 00:35.940]  difficulty, that's fine.
[00:35.980 --> 00:39.140]  But I'm really excited to see what custom mode will be available.
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.520]  OK, medium.
[00:41.880 --> 00:43.480]  I'm a first person guy.
[00:44.120 --> 00:44.560]  Interesting.
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.420]  Who's feeling I pick Max before.
[00:48.220 --> 00:50.300]  So these are the same people from the last game.
[00:50.700 --> 00:52.280]  Yeah. Let's do hoops.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.600]  You and I both like basketball.
[00:54.620 --> 00:58.800]  So I hoops is who I play in in Grounded 1 as well.
[00:58.940 --> 01:02.400]  I have not beaten Grounded 1 yet,
[01:02.500 --> 01:05.980]  but I'm assuming this is is a canonical sequel.
[01:06.320 --> 01:08.000]  Yes, it is a direct sequel.
[01:08.460 --> 01:10.200]  I'm going to pick our park world name.
[01:10.380 --> 01:13.920]  Did Grounded 1 in on a cliffhanger or did it resolve?
[01:14.780 --> 01:16.700]  I would say it resolved. You got big.
[01:16.760 --> 01:18.140]  You found a way to become big again.
[01:18.300 --> 01:22.300]  So this game is about it's like a year later, I believe, since that happened.
[01:22.520 --> 01:26.060]  And you're at a park commemorating the event and everything goes wrong again.
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.260]  This event.
[01:27.380 --> 01:29.280]  You gotta stay away from these events.
[01:30.240 --> 01:32.060]  We're going to make a goof world.
[01:32.320 --> 01:34.200]  I love the name of our park.
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.740]  In goof time, obviously.
[01:37.100 --> 01:41.200]  Dude, goof world has just become a part of the parlance of my family
[01:41.720 --> 01:42.960]  since that episode.
[01:43.500 --> 01:46.940]  It's just become accepted logic that we all are accepted lore
[01:46.940 --> 01:48.100]  that we all live in goof world.
[01:48.560 --> 01:49.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51.340 --> 01:53.660]  I really want them to sell one of these action figures.
[01:53.660 --> 01:58.160]  Oh, I'm not an action figure guy, but I would buy that.
[01:58.600 --> 02:00.560]  Yeah, you got you got to get a yoked girth.
[02:01.480 --> 02:02.480]  Absolutely. Yeah.
[02:05.160 --> 02:06.400]  A lot of hot dogs.
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.460]  So I've played this game a bit.
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.320]  A lot of hot dogs in this game.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.060]  Well, they know their audience.
[02:12.760 --> 02:13.320]  They sure do.
[02:17.700 --> 02:20.780]  That looks like the mom from The Incredibles a little bit.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.200]  I can see that.
[02:23.060 --> 02:24.760]  If you put glasses, those glasses.
[02:24.760 --> 02:27.480]  Yes, we're also going to renovate.
[02:27.600 --> 02:30.300]  I really enjoy the writing in this game so far.
[02:30.380 --> 02:30.940]  It's very funny.
[02:31.900 --> 02:32.820]  Breaking news.
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.760]  There's been an explosion at Brook Hollow Park.
[02:36.080 --> 02:39.940]  That's where we were descended on a ceremony commemorating the two year
[02:39.940 --> 02:44.340]  anniversary of when four teenagers were miniaturized against their will
[02:44.340 --> 02:47.200]  and left to fight for their survival in the backyard.
[02:49.460 --> 02:52.880]  Formerly evil company, Ominent Practical Technologies
[02:52.880 --> 02:56.020]  was set to dedicate a statue of formerly evil.
[02:56.620 --> 02:58.860]  Yep. Oh, they're transparent now.
[02:58.860 --> 03:02.180]  Geoff Tully, inventor of the revolutionary spacer
[03:02.180 --> 03:03.400]  shrinking technology.
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.220]  When an explosion erupted, the park has been evacuated and sealed off by Ominent.
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.640]  So instead of an abandoned backyard, this game is set in a park,
[03:12.800 --> 03:15.320]  which allows for some interesting things.
[03:15.680 --> 03:19.020]  Yeah, that I imagine that makes the map a lot bigger, too.
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.780]  Probably grilling hamburgers.
[03:20.860 --> 03:21.880]  It's hard to tell.
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.620]  I would assume so, but this is a game that's releasing in early access.
[03:26.040 --> 03:29.160]  And I know the first Grounded, when they put it out in early access,
[03:29.220 --> 03:30.340]  it was very early.
[03:30.460 --> 03:33.440]  So I don't know necessarily how far along they are within this one.
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.140]  But I also got to say, it's not like I'm complaining about the map size in Grounded.
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.280]  Oh, the map is huge, dude.
[03:39.820 --> 03:42.060]  Actually, now that I think about it, I don't know that I need a bigger map.
[03:44.900 --> 03:48.500]  No, it is definitely massive and like very biome centric.
[03:49.420 --> 03:50.860]  It's cool how they incorporate
[03:52.240 --> 03:55.920]  things like you have an ice world because there's like a fridge or an ice cream
[03:55.920 --> 03:57.540]  that you got knocked over.
[04:00.020 --> 04:01.160]  All the bugs.
[04:04.360 --> 04:07.780]  And I've never been scared of spiders, you know, I'm a snake guy.
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.820]  Yeah, but if I were to become scared of spiders,
[04:10.820 --> 04:12.860]  it might be because of the spiders in this game.
[04:13.740 --> 04:14.640]  Oh, they're terrifying.
[04:14.880 --> 04:16.900]  Yeah, it's seen like a scorpion.
[04:16.960 --> 04:17.840]  They got scorpions now.
[04:18.260 --> 04:19.220]  Yeah, it's
[04:20.220 --> 04:22.680]  it's brutal, brutal out there in this park.
[04:28.850 --> 04:31.650]  Oh, I bet I would be
[04:32.850 --> 04:36.410]  pretty pissed off if I got re-shrunk two years
[04:36.410 --> 04:38.830]  after being shrunk and going through that ordeal.
[04:39.410 --> 04:41.350]  Yeah, it happening twice is insane.
[04:41.650 --> 04:42.630]  What are the odds?
[04:46.670 --> 04:50.370]  The park, this is where we're going to be.
[04:53.010 --> 04:55.230]  Why? I need to jog my memory.
[04:55.410 --> 04:57.870]  Hey, I would just stay in here on TV.
[04:58.070 --> 04:58.970]  Yeah, we're just going to live here now.
[04:59.130 --> 05:00.890]  I mean, they did plenty of coffee.
[05:00.910 --> 05:02.650]  Apparently they got nice TV.
[05:02.870 --> 05:05.910]  Oh, so many places to sit.
[05:06.150 --> 05:07.690]  I think I followed some brochures.
[05:09.990 --> 05:10.270]  What?
[05:12.570 --> 05:13.870]  You have a favorite mug.
[05:16.770 --> 05:18.910]  Uh, yeah, I got a
[05:18.910 --> 05:21.590]  Millie got me a like a number one dad mug
[05:21.590 --> 05:22.930]  that I like quite a lot.
[05:23.530 --> 05:24.190]  That's great.
[05:24.490 --> 05:25.490]  Got like an anchor on it.
[05:25.550 --> 05:26.770]  It's like a little tattoo kind of mug.
[05:27.210 --> 05:28.050]  Oh, very cool.
[05:28.150 --> 05:30.570]  I also I don't know why, but I have a
[05:30.990 --> 05:34.170]  I think it's a 20th anniversary Rooster Teeth mug,
[05:34.250 --> 05:35.550]  but it could be 19th.
[05:35.550 --> 05:36.310]  It could be 21st.
[05:36.350 --> 05:37.450]  I don't pay attention to the date.
[05:37.790 --> 05:39.330]  I just really like that that mug.
[05:39.430 --> 05:43.190]  And it's like one of my only pieces of Rooster Teeth ephemera that I have left.
[05:46.670 --> 05:47.430]  Scab 2k.
[05:49.830 --> 05:50.850]  What a good mugs.
[05:51.370 --> 05:52.930]  I'll say that about the Rooster Teeth store.
[05:53.050 --> 05:55.050]  Yeah, I thought they did good mugs.
[05:55.470 --> 05:57.510]  We definitely over indexed in mug quality.
[05:57.670 --> 06:00.110]  Do you, Andrew, have a favorite mug?
[06:00.870 --> 06:04.350]  No, I'm not really a mug user because I don't drink coffee.
[06:04.470 --> 06:05.790]  I'm not much of a tea drinker.
[06:06.190 --> 06:09.570]  I enjoy a hot chocolate, but I'm not drinking it enough to like
[06:09.570 --> 06:12.110]  establish a favorite mug.
[06:12.390 --> 06:14.790]  I'm having this whole conversation with you, and I just realize
[06:14.790 --> 06:19.370]  I'm looking at an Anma and a drunk gamers dot com mug on my desk
[06:19.370 --> 06:22.510]  next to my fucking TV or my monitor right now.
[06:23.110 --> 06:24.350]  Maybe I should have picked one of those.
[06:24.890 --> 06:27.770]  I could see mugs being like the Trojan horse of collectibles.
[06:28.130 --> 06:31.050]  Yeah, like people just collecting mugs, not really realizing
[06:31.050 --> 06:32.970]  that they're becoming a collector of the thing.
[06:33.050 --> 06:35.430]  And then all of a sudden they have 15 mugs.
[06:35.790 --> 06:39.470]  Can I tell you a mug thing that I do that I've been doing my entire adult life?
[06:39.570 --> 06:42.170]  And it's kind of a joke, but it's also kind of serious.
[06:43.030 --> 06:47.010]  When I was a kid, you know, grownups were always obsessed with the royal family,
[06:47.010 --> 06:49.950]  at least in the 80s when I was a kid.
[06:50.150 --> 06:52.450]  And my wife still seems to be pretty obsessed with the royal family.
[06:52.670 --> 06:55.470]  But so anytime there would be like a new wedding
[06:56.750 --> 07:00.030]  or a coronation or whatever, I would I would always like,
[07:00.290 --> 07:03.470]  I feel like in my life, aunts and grandparents and stuff
[07:03.470 --> 07:05.430]  would get like commemorative plates and shit.
[07:06.050 --> 07:10.050]  Mm hmm. So I started buying commemorative mugs
[07:10.050 --> 07:12.190]  every time something happens with the royal family.
[07:12.270 --> 07:13.270]  So I like have a
[07:15.070 --> 07:18.650]  I have a William and Kate marriage mug in my fridge.
[07:18.710 --> 07:20.070]  Oh, my God. Right now.
[07:20.150 --> 07:21.590]  That's the most recent one I bought.
[07:21.810 --> 07:24.410]  But does it say William and Kate on it or is it?
[07:24.550 --> 07:26.970]  Yeah, it's like a picture of them and they're like flowers around it.
[07:26.970 --> 07:27.990]  And it's from when they got married.
[07:29.090 --> 07:29.730]  That's phenomenal.
[07:30.150 --> 07:32.850]  I realize I need to get a Harry and Meghan mug if they make one.
[07:33.410 --> 07:35.410]  Sure do. But I buy it.
[07:35.450 --> 07:37.210]  I bought it kind of as a joke, but also not.
[07:37.270 --> 07:39.230]  You know, like it's kind of it's like, yeah, this is funny.
[07:39.270 --> 07:40.130]  I'm still doing it, though.
[07:40.170 --> 07:42.170]  And I'm the only and I'm only doing it to make me laugh.
[07:42.170 --> 07:43.070]  Nobody else in the world.
[07:43.070 --> 07:45.590]  So am I really just doing it, you know?
[07:48.550 --> 07:49.710]  Oh, it's amazing.
[07:49.910 --> 07:51.110]  I didn't know that. Yeah.
[07:52.470 --> 07:54.390]  OK, so we got to analyze some stuff.
[07:56.310 --> 07:57.590]  And then you get recipes.
[07:57.910 --> 07:59.710]  It's very grounded. It's great.
[08:02.150 --> 08:03.770]  Essentially, you can scan an item
[08:03.770 --> 08:07.990]  and then you learn recipes relating to that item and you get raw science
[08:08.510 --> 08:11.650]  and brain power, and when you level up, you unlock a tier of items
[08:11.650 --> 08:13.270]  every time you level up your brain power.
[08:13.730 --> 08:15.150]  So this sometimes you already know them.
[08:15.450 --> 08:18.330]  Pretty similar to the mechanics of Grounded One, then.
[08:18.890 --> 08:20.070]  It is. Yeah, that's cool.
[08:21.010 --> 08:23.330]  It's one of the things that I like about the game is you
[08:23.330 --> 08:26.110]  like when you sit down to play it, it's so different.
[08:26.290 --> 08:27.650]  You're not sure what to expect.
[08:27.790 --> 08:32.750]  And then you realize how deep the leveling and inspecting
[08:33.370 --> 08:35.510]  mechanics are and the combining.
[08:35.750 --> 08:38.130]  It's like there's a lot to this game, or at least the first one.
[08:39.390 --> 08:43.630]  Yeah, I played it when it launched and I had fun, but it wasn't, you know,
[08:43.690 --> 08:47.170]  like something I felt like, oh, I'm definitely going to be putting tons of hours.
[08:47.350 --> 08:51.770]  Yeah. And then when it fully released, I revisited it and completely fell in love
[08:51.770 --> 08:53.490]  with it. Yeah, I had so much fun.
[08:53.570 --> 08:55.810]  It was all I could play for like a month.
[08:56.110 --> 08:58.570]  I think the last time I played it, I'd spent probably two hours
[08:58.570 --> 09:02.630]  just collecting stuff to level up armor, you know, and you're just like, oh, yeah.
[09:03.470 --> 09:06.150]  It's addictive, so it's plant fiber.
[09:06.870 --> 09:10.290]  Yeah, it becomes the joy of like, oh, I got to figure out how I'm going to take out
[09:10.290 --> 09:12.510]  this spider and then you just it's sort of,
[09:13.530 --> 09:16.810]  I don't know, I find it strangely meditative in some ways.
[09:16.810 --> 09:22.470]  I'm like, I'm going to really focus in and just sort of be in this mini wilderness.
[09:23.010 --> 09:26.790]  Yeah, got her spear.
[09:29.010 --> 09:30.410]  Pretty solid looking spear.
[09:31.570 --> 09:34.130]  Yeah, I certainly couldn't build a spear that good.
[09:36.150 --> 09:43.150]  To receive an opponent, your combat skills, you even have a holodeck here
[09:43.150 --> 09:45.410]  that I just don't leave.
[09:45.530 --> 09:46.650]  They'll come for you eventually.
[09:47.590 --> 09:48.970]  This is your life now.
[09:50.790 --> 09:55.630]  It's like Dave England, Jackass 4 with the science of the lambs.
[09:55.710 --> 09:56.810]  I'll make a life in here.
[09:57.170 --> 09:57.850]  I'm not leaving.
[10:01.270 --> 10:02.390]  This way.
[10:03.350 --> 10:05.130]  Is that technician calling in?
[10:05.130 --> 10:08.990]  So one of the things I figured we could do is that this save will carry over
[10:08.990 --> 10:10.930]  when it comes out to early access.
[10:11.430 --> 10:11.770]  Oh, it will.
[10:11.850 --> 10:12.830]  So maybe. Yeah.
[10:12.950 --> 10:16.810]  So maybe we could like start designing a base once we get out there for
[10:17.750 --> 10:19.850]  us and the rest of the guys.
[10:20.270 --> 10:21.210]  I would love that.
[10:21.270 --> 10:24.430]  How many is it for players for player call? Yeah.
[10:27.170 --> 10:31.030]  So we'll dump either Nick or Eric and then the others.
[10:32.650 --> 10:33.730]  I think Eric.
[10:33.730 --> 10:34.890]  Yeah. Get rid of Eric.
[10:35.110 --> 10:36.030]  That's that makes sense.
[10:36.190 --> 10:38.890]  Yeah, I think I think Nick will be into the building and all that.
[10:39.190 --> 10:39.590]  Absolutely.
[10:44.980 --> 10:47.100]  I'm going to try to save Burgl is like
[10:47.640 --> 10:50.260]  seems to be the central campaign hook so far.
[10:50.620 --> 10:52.940]  OK. And you're further than this.
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.780]  You've already played a few hours.
[10:54.980 --> 10:58.500]  Yeah, I've probably played like four or five hours in my own time.
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.280]  It's cool.
[11:01.340 --> 11:03.700]  Let's see if I can if we can get far enough.
[11:04.300 --> 11:07.040]  I'd love to show you one of the big new mechanics in this game.
[11:08.400 --> 11:10.400]  Does it feel pretty intuitive?
[11:10.680 --> 11:13.400]  Like you're just picking up grounded one that just looks better?
[11:13.920 --> 11:14.640]  OK. Yes.
[11:16.120 --> 11:19.240]  It wasn't a huge learning curve as somebody who played grounded.
[11:19.780 --> 11:22.840]  The biggest learning curve I had in my first run through
[11:23.340 --> 11:27.180]  was it'll tell you like go find an acorn and then me having to go
[11:27.180 --> 11:29.220]  where the fuck were acorns in the first game.
[11:29.560 --> 11:30.780]  How do I find an acorn?
[11:31.240 --> 11:34.940]  Uh, which took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.300]  Turns out the big tree.
[11:36.660 --> 11:37.580]  Yeah, the oak tree.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.860]  I would think you'll find some.
[11:39.160 --> 11:41.800]  It'd be pretty close to the tree on that thing.
[11:41.940 --> 11:43.240]  Well, uh.
[11:44.760 --> 11:45.960]  So we can go in here.
[11:46.160 --> 11:47.440]  I like these little bases.
[11:47.540 --> 11:49.460]  I know they had them in the first game, but it just it
[11:49.880 --> 11:52.740]  almost gives me Fallout vibes, which I really appreciate.
[11:52.940 --> 11:53.220]  Yeah.
[11:54.420 --> 11:55.080]  Omni tool.
[11:55.820 --> 11:57.680]  No weapon, but the next best thing.
[11:58.140 --> 11:59.600]  I can't wait to chop things up.
[11:59.600 --> 12:02.470]  That looks much improved than last time.
[12:05.240 --> 12:05.940]  Shit.
[12:08.460 --> 12:09.880]  Don't go around.
[12:18.060 --> 12:20.380]  Cut some grass down.
[12:21.180 --> 12:22.120]  That's some tough grass.
[12:23.040 --> 12:23.380]  Yes.
[12:25.670 --> 12:27.840]  How do you think you'd fare as a mini version of you?
[12:28.780 --> 12:30.480]  How old am I?
[12:31.820 --> 12:33.020]  Let's say now.
[12:33.360 --> 12:33.800]  Not great.
[12:35.100 --> 12:36.020]  Not great.
[12:36.460 --> 12:37.700]  20 years ago. Awesome.
[12:38.520 --> 12:39.820]  I'd be up for the adventure.
[12:40.360 --> 12:43.240]  Now I don't want an adventure.
[12:43.860 --> 12:46.560]  I would hang out in the Omni net building
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.760]  and just eat their food and watch reruns of Brady Bunch
[12:51.760 --> 12:55.600]  or whatever's on their closed circuit TV and just wait it out.
[12:56.740 --> 12:59.840]  I wonder how long it would take you to finish a glass
[12:59.840 --> 13:02.380]  or a mug filled with coffee in your
[13:03.240 --> 13:04.740]  Mary and Harry or whatever.
[13:04.900 --> 13:05.660]  What's your name?
[13:06.920 --> 13:08.880]  Not Harry, William and Kate.
[13:08.960 --> 13:09.500]  Oh, William and Kate.
[13:10.340 --> 13:13.360]  Dude, I could that'd be my swimming pool if I was a little guy.
[13:15.720 --> 13:16.860]  I'm trying to think of like
[13:16.860 --> 13:19.800]  how long it would take me to go from my bed to the desk.
[13:20.040 --> 13:22.980]  That might be like I might have to expedition like a day
[13:22.980 --> 13:24.020]  before we start recording.
[13:24.740 --> 13:26.860]  Do you think you would
[13:28.380 --> 13:31.740]  like being tiny in your home, or do you think you would
[13:31.740 --> 13:35.220]  immediately hate yourself for the way your home is laid out?
[13:35.320 --> 13:36.880]  Now that you're a tiny person, do you think you'd be like, Oh,
[13:36.920 --> 13:39.240]  I had no idea that there was this much dirt under my bed.
[13:39.740 --> 13:40.980]  Disgusting. Oh, yeah.
[13:41.080 --> 13:42.440]  Or why did I hate it?
[13:42.660 --> 13:43.580]  Why did I put that there?
[13:43.600 --> 13:45.200]  I'll never be able to get to the top shelf now.
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.600]  It would be terrible.
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.140]  Yeah, I feel like I don't design my my home with mini me in mind.
[13:54.020 --> 13:56.580]  It would be incredibly frustrating because my brain goes
[13:57.120 --> 13:59.300]  immediately to like, I need a Barbie doll house.
[13:59.420 --> 14:00.440]  That's going to be my new home.
[14:00.600 --> 14:02.720]  But like, it would be frustrating to live in a house
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.200]  and the plumbing doesn't work like nothing.
[14:04.380 --> 14:07.800]  It's all like visually everything is there, but nothing is functional.
[14:08.380 --> 14:10.280]  It is like shit in a plastic thimble.
[14:10.500 --> 14:15.880]  Yeah, I mean, combat is trying to fight me.
[14:17.440 --> 14:18.140]  Where you at?
[14:18.700 --> 14:19.600]  That's this little guy.
[14:20.000 --> 14:20.580]  Two of them to.
[14:25.390 --> 14:26.710]  You ever tried spearfishing?
[14:27.410 --> 14:29.470]  I have not.
[14:29.870 --> 14:31.730]  No. Oh, have you?
[14:32.430 --> 14:35.850]  No, but I see it on Survivor all the time and it looks kind of fun.
[14:36.830 --> 14:40.930]  It seems like it used to be such a bigger part of Survivor in those,
[14:40.950 --> 14:42.810]  you know, teens and 20s seasons.
[14:43.630 --> 14:47.650]  Now it's like they're like, you get the big fishing gear or the medium
[14:47.650 --> 14:49.310]  fishing gear and they're like, whoo.
[14:49.310 --> 14:50.910]  And then you see one
[14:52.130 --> 14:54.870]  eight second shot of somebody coming out of the water
[14:54.870 --> 14:58.570]  with one fish, and then it's like the fishing gear never exists again
[14:58.570 --> 14:59.470]  for the rest of the season.
[15:00.190 --> 15:03.350]  Yeah, it's definitely not near the priority it once was.
[15:03.430 --> 15:07.110]  Gosh, OK, this is embarrassing, but you might recognize me from the commercial.
[15:08.210 --> 15:09.570]  Have you seen our new headquarters?
[15:10.010 --> 15:11.070]  It's transparent.
[15:15.110 --> 15:18.130]  If I had friends, I bet they'd tease me over that.
[15:18.650 --> 15:21.470]  I was brought on as part of the reforms after,
[15:22.170 --> 15:24.010]  well, you know, the dead teenagers.
[15:25.750 --> 15:30.230]  We're there in the company that turned out so there are dead teenagers person.
[15:31.730 --> 15:35.630]  Uh, the evacuation was, I guess I'm trying to remember.
[15:35.830 --> 15:37.490]  I haven't played the first game in so long.
[15:37.670 --> 15:39.490]  I don't remember anybody being dead in the first one.
[15:40.430 --> 15:41.570]  These guys are evil.
[15:41.710 --> 15:43.330]  Please be very careful.
[15:43.450 --> 15:44.450]  Oh, but used to be evil.
[15:44.690 --> 15:45.610]  You know, I apologize.
[15:45.870 --> 15:47.530]  Used to be a clear rebrand.
[15:48.290 --> 15:48.930]  I'm sorry.
[15:49.090 --> 15:50.190]  They brought in a mascot.
[15:50.370 --> 15:51.210]  They changed the logo.
[15:51.370 --> 15:52.150]  Everything was way better.
[15:52.150 --> 15:56.390]  They rebranded, just like Rushdie did in twenty twenty one, twenty two.
[15:56.830 --> 15:57.430]  Just playing.
[15:57.850 --> 15:58.230]  Just playing.
[16:00.370 --> 16:01.570]  You specifically.
[16:03.030 --> 16:03.730]  Oh, yeah, just me.
[16:03.790 --> 16:04.730]  I'm just playing currently.
[16:05.390 --> 16:09.010]  Specifically, you loved that tagline.
[16:10.110 --> 16:10.950]  Just playing.
[16:14.270 --> 16:14.870]  OK.
[16:17.330 --> 16:18.750]  Visit the rager station.
[16:20.210 --> 16:21.490]  So this is where, like,
[16:21.490 --> 16:23.150]  you can get recipes, love to get ice.
[16:23.850 --> 16:25.270]  We need to get a multi-story base.
[16:25.350 --> 16:27.710]  So we need to get some research points so we can get that going.
[16:33.020 --> 16:35.360]  Grass seed, if I want to do that, let's get a hammer going.
[16:37.400 --> 16:40.520]  So it is this game very much as like you said, is looking at like,
[16:40.800 --> 16:44.700]  I need a ladybug head and lingonberry leather and then just like spending
[16:45.180 --> 16:47.400]  a bunch of time trying to figure out how to get those things.
[16:47.680 --> 16:49.400]  You can help me become mega powerful.
[16:49.560 --> 16:50.760]  I need the shovel upgrade.
[16:52.040 --> 16:53.280]  And we're going to need a grass seed
[16:53.280 --> 16:54.540]  and we're going to need more science.
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.300]  Oh, God, we got to go get science.
[16:56.860 --> 16:57.980]  Let's open this up.
[16:58.140 --> 16:59.080]  Gathering when we need them.
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.160]  Oh, man.
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.520]  Who could do that?
[17:05.940 --> 17:07.580]  Science points in it.
[17:07.880 --> 17:08.540]  That'd be him.
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.220]  Oh, wait, I need a.
[17:17.880 --> 17:21.520]  It's like grass flower, but I need to get a grass seed.
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.160]  The last one didn't look bad,
[17:25.720 --> 17:27.280]  but this looks better.
[17:27.900 --> 17:30.100]  Oh, yeah, it looks beautiful.
[17:30.300 --> 17:31.480]  Like it wasn't like I played the last one.
[17:31.540 --> 17:32.620]  I thought, oh, this doesn't look good.
[17:32.660 --> 17:33.840]  It looked fine, but this is definitely.
[17:35.520 --> 17:37.440]  A brighter, more polished version of the game.
[17:38.800 --> 17:39.600]  Grass seed.
[17:40.540 --> 17:43.800]  Yeah, it's like a certain I think it's a grass flower.
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.740]  Get it from mainly just chopped some grass down just to be thorough.
[17:49.500 --> 17:51.180]  Listen, you're going to use it eventually.
[17:52.140 --> 17:52.920]  Oh, for sure.
[17:52.980 --> 17:54.500]  Yeah, we're going to need it for building our house.
[17:54.920 --> 17:56.440]  It's not those little sprigs, huh?
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.080]  No, definitely want to grab it.
[17:59.920 --> 18:00.280]  Yeah.
[18:01.320 --> 18:02.880]  Grass seed, grass seed, maybe this.
[18:03.500 --> 18:04.520]  Oh, that could be it.
[18:04.900 --> 18:05.360]  Grass flower.
[18:05.520 --> 18:05.840]  There we go.
[18:05.860 --> 18:06.200]  There you go.
[18:07.120 --> 18:08.280]  You're going to find like the wheat.
[18:10.040 --> 18:12.440]  You got to separate the wheat from the chaff.
[18:12.940 --> 18:13.580]  Oh, there we go.
[18:14.300 --> 18:14.840]  I saw it.
[18:15.540 --> 18:16.440]  Big old seed.
[18:17.700 --> 18:18.520]  That's a big boy.
[18:18.520 --> 18:20.540]  Single sunflower seed.
[18:20.640 --> 18:22.620]  If you're this small, that's a full dinner.
[18:22.780 --> 18:23.720]  It's a main course.
[18:24.620 --> 18:27.860]  That's so much sunflower that you are sick of sunflower seed
[18:27.860 --> 18:29.840]  before you even get close to finishing your meal.
[18:31.060 --> 18:35.100]  It's funny to think about like what would become dangerous at this scale.
[18:35.400 --> 18:39.020]  Like, I feel like you could die of hypothermia falling into a slurpee.
[18:39.300 --> 18:40.000]  If you're this small.
[18:40.300 --> 18:41.180]  You absolutely could.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.300]  Also, it's a dangerous drink.
[18:43.860 --> 18:46.940]  You know, portion size plays into it.
[18:46.940 --> 18:51.040]  But I wonder if actual item size affects how yummy it is.
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.360]  Like our sunflower seeds good because we can eat 20 at once and they're tiny.
[18:55.560 --> 18:57.080]  And it's like one bite per.
[18:57.420 --> 18:58.820]  Like if you had a big
[19:00.140 --> 19:03.380]  sunflower seed that was like the size of a T-bone,
[19:03.660 --> 19:06.200]  would that still taste as good as a little one?
[19:06.220 --> 19:08.480]  Or would it be too much in a proportion?
[19:08.600 --> 19:09.480]  You know what I mean? I don't know.
[19:09.680 --> 19:10.820]  That's such a good point.
[19:11.480 --> 19:13.140]  I'm trying to like think about
[19:13.760 --> 19:17.680]  would rice be at all appetizing if you're having two things of it?
[19:17.900 --> 19:19.500]  Exactly. Exactly.
[19:21.280 --> 19:23.400]  I mean, sushi feels like an impossibility.
[19:23.840 --> 19:24.500]  Oh, my God. Yeah.
[19:24.580 --> 19:26.320]  I feel like peanut butter is the same, right?
[19:26.340 --> 19:27.600]  Like some stuff. Oh, my God.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.480]  Doesn't change.
[19:28.640 --> 19:32.860]  But other stuff like the size of the the the size of the item
[19:32.860 --> 19:34.520]  you ingest, I think, plays a big part into
[19:36.300 --> 19:37.400]  how yummy it might be.
[19:37.760 --> 19:40.040]  Peanut butter, the scale, it becomes quicksand.
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.780]  But you'd also use it.
[19:42.960 --> 19:45.180]  You could also use it to build shit with, right?
[19:45.260 --> 19:46.740]  Like it'd become glue. Oh, yeah.
[19:49.340 --> 19:50.960]  You're going to attract all the ants.
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.160]  I'm just trying to add an expansion to my Barbie dream house.
[19:57.820 --> 19:59.000]  Or it gets a little too hot,
[19:59.080 --> 20:01.600]  the peanut butter melts in your house, just falls all around you.
[20:06.540 --> 20:09.100]  I wonder what video game
[20:09.620 --> 20:12.680]  was the first video game, Andrew,
[20:13.520 --> 20:16.220]  to incorporate workbench technology.
[20:16.800 --> 20:18.080]  Oh, that's interesting.
[20:18.640 --> 20:22.280]  Because the workbench has become a very important part
[20:22.280 --> 20:26.180]  of almost all open world sandbox games we play.
[20:26.920 --> 20:27.760]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[20:29.020 --> 20:32.500]  I wouldn't be surprised if like technically it was in some of those old
[20:32.500 --> 20:35.320]  like adventure games where you have to go to like the workbench
[20:35.320 --> 20:38.300]  to try different things via typing in commands.
[20:38.900 --> 20:40.060]  Do you remember?
[20:41.420 --> 20:43.820]  A workbench in a video game before Minecraft?
[20:44.180 --> 20:45.600]  I know it wasn't the first.
[20:46.680 --> 20:47.660]  I go, you know what?
[20:47.860 --> 20:48.680]  Yeah, Resident Evil.
[20:48.960 --> 20:51.180]  Resident Evil had workbenches. Oh, yeah.
[20:53.360 --> 20:57.100]  Fallout had workbenches prior to for that.
[20:58.940 --> 20:59.260]  I don't know.
[20:59.300 --> 21:00.880]  That's a really interesting question, though, Geoff.
[21:02.260 --> 21:05.480]  So we luckily the Clover Hood
[21:06.100 --> 21:08.460]  audience is infinitely smarter than we are.
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.480]  So they'll be. Oh, absolutely.
[21:09.620 --> 21:12.780]  Yeah, I'm excited to look at the comments and be like, Oh, it's this.
[21:13.960 --> 21:15.640]  Let's just put a roasting spit down.
[21:15.700 --> 21:18.700]  We can move it later, but we just need them science points. Yeah.
[21:22.040 --> 21:24.620]  I like the idea of a baby pebble being called a pebblet.
[21:28.140 --> 21:29.000]  Pebblet Junior.
[21:31.420 --> 21:33.900]  Pebblet is going to fight Ilia Tepuria next, right?
[21:35.480 --> 21:37.120]  Patty Pebblet. Patty Pebblet.
[21:37.760 --> 21:39.880]  Yeah. Oh, fuck you.
[21:42.780 --> 21:44.120]  That's an angry pebble.
[21:48.900 --> 21:50.480]  With the grass.
[21:52.960 --> 21:54.260]  Thank you. Yeah.
[21:55.860 --> 21:57.120]  Going to be hungry later.
[21:57.640 --> 21:59.940]  Dude, that's one thing about being tiny, too.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.460]  You're just you're going to get covered in goo all the time.
[22:05.480 --> 22:08.540]  At that size, everything makes good about them.
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.340]  Yeah, the cats of the grass jungle.
[22:14.580 --> 22:18.700]  Yeah, really like things like there's no functional bandaid for you.
[22:19.980 --> 22:21.360]  They're not going to translate at all.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.400]  It's a full body thing.
[22:22.620 --> 22:23.660]  You're mummifying yourself.
[22:24.420 --> 22:28.480]  Yeah, but you're still going to get cuts and scrapes and 100%. Yeah.
[22:32.400 --> 22:33.700]  It's science points.
[22:33.720 --> 22:35.340]  How many science points would be at 300?
[22:35.460 --> 22:36.440]  I think I need 50 more.
[22:38.120 --> 22:42.140]  Probably the number one cause of death for tiny people is is tetanus.
[22:42.240 --> 22:48.540]  I would think, oh, just like not being able to get big enough to take antibiotics.
[22:50.760 --> 22:55.700]  Yeah, I I appreciate the ability that this game gives of allowing us
[22:55.700 --> 22:59.040]  to speculate what life is like at a microscopic scale.
[23:00.420 --> 23:02.680]  Tell you what, it makes me appreciate the size I'm at.
[23:03.500 --> 23:04.200]  Sure does.
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.620]  Build lean to. Yeah.
[23:07.140 --> 23:09.380]  Kill gnats. OK, we can find some gnats.
[23:11.500 --> 23:14.340]  Find some gnats and then maybe we could start building some bases,
[23:14.500 --> 23:15.900]  which is something I typically don't do,
[23:15.960 --> 23:18.580]  but I want to make sure we're all cozy and ready to go.
[23:19.340 --> 23:22.520]  Well, plus it will have a little regulation home for everybody, you know.
[23:22.880 --> 23:24.760]  That's true. That is essential.
[23:26.160 --> 23:27.800]  There's some gnats over here, maybe.
[23:30.260 --> 23:31.240]  Oh, is that a gnat?
[23:31.520 --> 23:32.260]  It's a mite. Oh, here we go.
[23:32.920 --> 23:34.640]  Oh, we got some gnats.
[23:35.660 --> 23:38.500]  Get over here. Oh, he's a kill.
[23:39.280 --> 23:40.640]  Dude, don't slope that water.
[23:41.980 --> 23:45.180]  Oh, shit. I'm getting messed up by these mites.
[23:45.360 --> 23:49.080]  Oh, dude, where's my respawn point?
[23:49.180 --> 23:50.200]  OK, nearest outpost.
[23:51.340 --> 23:52.180]  That's not bad.
[23:53.180 --> 23:53.440]  Close.
[23:56.800 --> 24:01.020]  It's a lot of oh, no, I died and I'm on the other side of the map.
[24:01.020 --> 24:02.400]  I'm playing solo.
[24:02.800 --> 24:04.380]  I'm excited we have a full crew.
[24:04.480 --> 24:06.640]  We're able to play this. Yeah, a lot of fun.
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.100]  I've been looking for like a building game for all of us.
[24:11.420 --> 24:12.820]  And I think this could be it.
[24:13.020 --> 24:16.920]  I've only played multiplayer once and just with burned on, but it was a lot of fun.
[24:17.600 --> 24:19.000]  I dude, I want a building game.
[24:19.100 --> 24:22.520]  I want a persistent world for us to act with so badly.
[24:24.200 --> 24:26.420]  If this is a good one, I would love it. Yeah.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.320]  Uh, I'm a gnat.
[24:30.380 --> 24:31.260]  Stop flying.
[24:32.560 --> 24:35.280]  Uh, I throw these.
[24:35.380 --> 24:36.580]  OK, this is dangerous.
[24:38.180 --> 24:42.240]  I tried to in my my single player game, I needed some water,
[24:42.380 --> 24:45.380]  so I was aiming it at a water droplet, but I missed and didn't think about
[24:45.380 --> 24:47.480]  the fact that my spear was now just gone.
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.580]  Dude, that's the first mistake everybody makes on a new season of alone.
[24:51.960 --> 24:55.120]  They get excited to see a bird or a pheasant or something in a tree,
[24:55.120 --> 24:58.120]  and then they like launch an arrow and they go, Oh, my God.
[24:58.840 --> 24:59.960]  I'm going to never find that.
[25:00.060 --> 25:01.840]  I'll never find. I only have eight arrows left.
[25:04.200 --> 25:05.920]  Let's go scan some stuff.
[25:07.740 --> 25:11.200]  If you see any areas, Geoff, that you think would be good for a base start,
[25:11.300 --> 25:13.840]  let me call it out. We can clear it out for a second.
[25:14.680 --> 25:18.060]  Turn around. I think up on a hill is nice like this.
[25:18.200 --> 25:20.260]  It's a big, flat, hilly area.
[25:20.320 --> 25:22.120]  I'm not saying this one, but something like this.
[25:22.120 --> 25:24.620]  You know, you want to build up there.
[25:24.720 --> 25:27.180]  It could be good where the acorn, by the way, there's an acorn if you need one.
[25:27.640 --> 25:29.360]  Yeah. Oh, we're we're going to need one.
[25:30.080 --> 25:31.220]  Up there could be nice.
[25:32.680 --> 25:35.700]  Someplace higher up so that maybe you can see it from a distance.
[25:36.400 --> 25:37.240]  That's fair. Better.
[25:38.420 --> 25:40.560]  Oh, you can put markers down, which is nice.
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.280]  That's just one really easily. So.
[25:43.840 --> 25:46.680]  Uh, I have everything I need for the shovel upgrade.
[25:49.200 --> 25:50.440]  Is that going to cost me?
[25:50.880 --> 25:54.140]  Uh, could also could also be cool to build out.
[25:54.220 --> 25:54.860]  Can we get these?
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.040]  Uh, we eventually get these devices in our house.
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.880]  The ranger stations, not from what I've seen.
[26:02.720 --> 26:04.560]  The maybe maybe the house connects.
[26:05.400 --> 26:07.660]  To this place or what I could.
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.220]  Like this could be the basement.
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.400]  Let's go see if some Nats respond and then get the shovel.
[26:17.600 --> 26:19.220]  Got some food going.
[26:20.400 --> 26:21.280]  Oh, he's got to get some.
[26:21.460 --> 26:22.880]  Oh, I collected some new stuff.
[26:22.940 --> 26:24.400]  I should scan it.
[26:26.280 --> 26:26.840]  He's me.
[26:29.820 --> 26:30.180]  Science.
[26:30.920 --> 26:31.960]  A lot of science here, buddy.
[26:32.560 --> 26:33.500]  Oh, we're getting some points.
[26:34.280 --> 26:36.300]  You can do four charges at a time and you got to wait.
[26:36.480 --> 26:38.580]  But we'll get some of this done.
[26:42.470 --> 26:45.510]  I'd love to know who the Ross is, the science guy is.
[26:45.650 --> 26:47.150]  Yeah, that's somebody at the studio.
[26:47.810 --> 26:50.930]  Is that like a voice actor of a different character?
[26:53.350 --> 26:55.230]  It's like the EA sports guy.
[26:55.370 --> 26:59.370]  Like, I really I like people that have one line that's very iconic,
[26:59.370 --> 27:03.490]  but it's like, I'm the I'm the I'm the science guy, the raw science guy.
[27:04.530 --> 27:08.990]  It's the new like the 2025 version of being like the micromachines guy.
[27:09.730 --> 27:10.150]  Yes.
[27:12.650 --> 27:13.610]  Some clover.
[27:13.950 --> 27:15.310]  Any Nats respawn?
[27:17.290 --> 27:18.530]  That's not looking like it.
[27:18.610 --> 27:20.810]  I guess maybe we'll go further out, see if we can find some.
[27:21.050 --> 27:22.230]  How many more do you Nats?
[27:23.110 --> 27:24.730]  I think just oh, dead person.
[27:25.210 --> 27:26.190]  That's a dead person.
[27:26.650 --> 27:28.370]  Oh, we can rummage their stuff.
[27:29.230 --> 27:30.430]  Got some rotten food.
[27:31.330 --> 27:32.290]  That's disappointing.
[27:33.710 --> 27:34.630]  Another acorn.
[27:36.410 --> 27:39.230]  They were all around the starting area, which makes sense,
[27:39.250 --> 27:41.990]  or the starting base, and I just could not find them.
[27:42.670 --> 27:43.650]  Popping lights.
[27:45.470 --> 27:48.710]  Sometimes you just dumb, you know,
[27:49.130 --> 27:52.530]  no matter how smart you are other times, sometimes even
[27:52.530 --> 27:57.930]  even Albert Einstein must have had his just absolutely just dipshit days.
[27:59.050 --> 28:03.570]  That'd be a great book of the dumbest, the smartest people ever felt.
[28:03.890 --> 28:07.390]  Yeah. The smartest people's the smartest people's dumbest days.
[28:07.630 --> 28:09.130]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[28:09.450 --> 28:10.630]  You are not up for that, buddy.
[28:10.630 --> 28:12.170]  No, I'm still.
[28:12.390 --> 28:15.190]  Oh, do you? You better get to base.
[28:15.330 --> 28:16.670]  I'm running. I'm running. I'm running.
[28:17.870 --> 28:19.850]  I die. I want to be close to home.
[28:19.990 --> 28:21.890]  I can hear them. They're up your ass.
[28:21.970 --> 28:24.350]  I can hear them. Get them stuck in a spider web.
[28:24.790 --> 28:26.130]  Oh, don't turn back around.
[28:26.550 --> 28:28.530]  They're not. They're not coming off there.
[28:28.730 --> 28:29.870]  They're they're sticking with you.
[28:30.710 --> 28:32.510]  They can climb better than you can.
[28:33.690 --> 28:36.430]  Like that. Oh, no, they can definitely climb.
[28:36.950 --> 28:38.990]  OK. No.
[28:39.950 --> 28:41.250]  Why are they mad at me?
[28:42.070 --> 28:43.630]  You rolled up in their territory.
[28:44.110 --> 28:46.790]  I guess. Yeah. You flashed the wrong colors.
[28:47.310 --> 28:53.110]  And let's. You were repping the wrong set.
[28:54.590 --> 28:57.590]  Get more brainpower, at least in some raw science.
[28:58.790 --> 29:00.310]  I mean, like 20 more.
[29:00.370 --> 29:01.310]  Oh, do I have enough now?
[29:01.910 --> 29:02.670]  I think I have enough.
[29:03.570 --> 29:04.670]  Yeah. Hell yeah.
[29:08.420 --> 29:09.880]  The hammer and the shovel.
[29:11.960 --> 29:14.180]  How do we need to do follow Sloan's coordinates?
[29:14.580 --> 29:23.170]  OK. I'm going to break some more grass down just so we have it.
[29:24.130 --> 29:25.290]  I also should heal.
[29:29.030 --> 29:31.750]  I always hit the wrong button no matter what.
[29:31.870 --> 29:34.970]  Like, you know, you with flipping coins, you're always putting on the wrong sock.
[29:35.050 --> 29:38.190]  Like, I know there's one of three buttons I need to hit.
[29:38.250 --> 29:40.990]  I know what all those buttons are, but I always click the wrong one
[29:40.990 --> 29:42.030]  for what I'm going for initially.
[29:42.030 --> 29:43.950]  I have that problem with road as well.
[29:44.850 --> 29:46.150]  I'm just like a left.
[29:46.370 --> 29:48.290]  There's like a left bumper menu and a right button member.
[29:48.410 --> 29:51.550]  And I'll menu and I always hit the opposite one that I mean to.
[29:56.790 --> 29:57.670]  Oh, spooky.
[29:58.330 --> 29:59.750]  Well, spooky cave.
[30:01.730 --> 30:02.750]  Snack bar, anthill.
[30:03.010 --> 30:03.630]  That's not good.
[30:05.930 --> 30:08.250]  Let's grab some of these and then.
[30:10.070 --> 30:11.350]  We can craft.
[30:13.370 --> 30:14.170]  I mean, we can't.
[30:14.170 --> 30:15.510]  Maybe I haven't discovered it yet.
[30:16.350 --> 30:20.310]  Let's go back and scan it and then we'll be able to make a torch.
[30:20.850 --> 30:22.370]  Yeah. Make a little glowstone.
[30:22.610 --> 30:23.310]  Oh, is that a quarter?
[30:23.570 --> 30:28.050]  But yeah, it's seeing it at this scale
[30:28.050 --> 30:32.310]  makes it feel like it's worth so much more, even though that's not how currency
[30:32.310 --> 30:35.390]  works, but my brain, I'm like, that's like a million dollars. Yeah.
[30:36.530 --> 30:37.670]  That's so much money.
[30:37.710 --> 30:38.650]  It's worth his weight in gold.
[30:38.750 --> 30:41.030]  Oh, more nets get over here.
[30:42.490 --> 30:44.370]  Oh, oh, nice.
[30:44.770 --> 30:45.850]  I just need one more.
[30:46.870 --> 30:48.130]  Yes, science.
[30:48.130 --> 30:49.450]  Raw science right there, buddy.
[30:51.910 --> 30:52.730]  I should eat something.
[30:52.850 --> 30:54.930]  I like that this game encourages STEM.
[30:56.310 --> 30:57.110]  Oh, absolutely.
[31:01.460 --> 31:02.900]  Cooked bug meat on a campfire.
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.800]  Going to get some more bugs.
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.100]  Some easy science right there.
[31:07.300 --> 31:08.700]  You low on bug right now?
[31:09.420 --> 31:11.100]  I'm low on cookable bug.
[31:12.700 --> 31:14.080]  This is a place you don't want to be.
[31:14.320 --> 31:15.320]  That would also suck.
[31:16.160 --> 31:16.560]  Yeah.
[31:16.740 --> 31:20.560]  Having to eat bugs, cook and eat bugs and get used to it, you know?
[31:21.780 --> 31:26.260]  It would be a weird thing to have to describe if you became big again
[31:26.740 --> 31:30.340]  of like trying to convince people that like, no, like these gnats.
[31:30.600 --> 31:31.500]  Delicious steak.
[31:31.740 --> 31:33.560]  Yeah, I'm telling you, it's better than wagging.
[31:34.040 --> 31:34.500]  I understand.
[31:35.020 --> 31:39.580]  I understand how small you think it is, but trust me, it is huge.
[31:39.580 --> 31:40.980]  Absolute delicacy.
[31:43.720 --> 31:47.940]  Throw these on the fire and then I can scan that thing.
[31:48.560 --> 31:50.580]  The fall damage are just not that size.
[31:51.360 --> 31:51.860]  Is it the other one?
[31:51.920 --> 31:55.780]  Did you have to get like you had to like you made parachutes
[31:55.780 --> 31:58.700]  and you could make a golden parachute that lasted forever?
[32:00.080 --> 32:03.660]  And this one, it's like you get like dandelion stem type thing.
[32:04.080 --> 32:05.340]  And kind of like float down.
[32:05.520 --> 32:07.180]  Yeah, that's I haven't found any like.
[32:08.240 --> 32:09.200]  Functional parachutes.
[32:10.960 --> 32:13.500]  Try to unlocks, but now I can build a torch.
[32:14.880 --> 32:16.840]  Let's wait a minute for these to cook.
[32:17.500 --> 32:20.620]  While that cooks, let's craft.
[32:22.420 --> 32:24.520]  Did I not get a torch for that?
[32:25.280 --> 32:27.880]  I got a torch and nifty needle.
[32:28.960 --> 32:30.220]  Oh, maybe I had it.
[32:30.740 --> 32:31.240]  Here we go.
[32:32.280 --> 32:35.960]  This is another mechanic that's in so many video games.
[32:35.960 --> 32:40.960]  You you build a fire and then you bring in meat and then you roast it
[32:40.960 --> 32:42.660]  and then you take it off and then you have food.
[32:43.160 --> 32:44.140]  I feel like they do.
[32:44.260 --> 32:47.600]  They do such a good job of getting you to the moment where you put the meat on
[32:47.600 --> 32:52.080]  and then video games just drop the next important part of that scenario,
[32:52.200 --> 32:55.300]  which is where everybody sits around the fire and like tell stories and stuff.
[32:55.580 --> 32:58.500]  There should be some sort of a mini game you can enter into
[32:58.500 --> 33:03.040]  that if you hit the buttons right, you like increase your social skills or something.
[33:03.980 --> 33:06.680]  Oh, then you can befriend bugs.
[33:09.100 --> 33:11.320]  Not the insects like Bugs Bunny.
[33:11.420 --> 33:12.820]  We're bringing Bugs Bunny in this.
[33:12.940 --> 33:15.240]  We're doing a full we're bringing it back.
[33:17.320 --> 33:19.900]  I thought that Fable did that very well.
[33:20.340 --> 33:22.040]  The Fable franchise. Yeah.
[33:22.760 --> 33:24.760]  They would have those little social mini games you would do.
[33:25.980 --> 33:26.460]  Yeah, they're fun.
[33:29.280 --> 33:30.440]  That's nice, Torch.
[33:31.100 --> 33:31.980]  Pill bug. That's cool.
[33:31.980 --> 33:34.100]  No, I don't want to take one of those.
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.060]  I think over here, I supposed to go.
[33:41.300 --> 33:45.020]  Yeah. Break this pebble.
[33:49.710 --> 33:50.850]  Get ready to fight.
[33:53.050 --> 33:53.550]  Good luck, man.
[33:54.150 --> 33:55.070]  Each one made it through.
[33:55.430 --> 33:57.450]  I got this. I got this.
[33:57.510 --> 33:58.030]  I've been training.
[33:58.410 --> 34:00.630]  I've been watching tape on this soldier, aunt.
[34:04.410 --> 34:06.270]  Oh, this actually isn't going great.
[34:07.610 --> 34:08.770]  He'll he'll he'll.
[34:09.130 --> 34:09.950]  That's not he'll.
[34:12.810 --> 34:14.890]  I died eating a little snack.
[34:16.870 --> 34:18.030]  Maybe I need some armor.
[34:18.470 --> 34:19.950]  You don't drop your stuff on. That's cool.
[34:20.710 --> 34:21.330]  Oh, yeah, you do.
[34:21.530 --> 34:22.590]  Oh, you just keep some of it.
[34:22.710 --> 34:25.010]  But like, yeah, you see your backpack over there.
[34:26.230 --> 34:28.950]  Let's let's build a bed so I can make a day.
[34:28.950 --> 34:30.970]  Yeah, probably.
[34:31.270 --> 34:33.570]  Although it's never going to be daytime in the anthill.
[34:34.370 --> 34:35.750]  Wrong button three times.
[34:36.770 --> 34:39.690]  I like that you can like place these things and then
[34:40.430 --> 34:43.170]  you just know it's here like you get the outline and it's like, OK,
[34:43.210 --> 34:45.590]  I mean, cloverleafs and yeah, that is very cool.
[34:47.670 --> 34:49.390]  Let's get some of those. Those are easy.
[34:49.870 --> 34:53.790]  It lets you do some of the design work before you have to, you know.
[34:54.310 --> 34:55.910]  Yes. Which is kind of cool.
[34:55.990 --> 34:57.870]  And then you can just move it if you need to.
[34:58.450 --> 35:01.770]  I also like games that don't penalize you for moving stuff.
[35:03.530 --> 35:04.570]  Yes, absolutely.
[35:06.010 --> 35:08.690]  It's annoying when you have to like you decide you want to move something
[35:08.690 --> 35:10.390]  and you lose like 20 percent.
[35:10.670 --> 35:12.030]  Yeah, sources. Exactly.
[35:13.310 --> 35:13.910]  Super build.
[35:15.050 --> 35:17.030]  Let's put the torch down.
[35:18.730 --> 35:20.850]  I set a spawn point, sleep to morning.
[35:23.330 --> 35:26.870]  Imagine if sleep was this efficient, you just can't sleep the morning.
[35:27.490 --> 35:28.990]  Get a solid eight hours.
[35:30.270 --> 35:31.250]  What a life.
[35:31.510 --> 35:33.730]  Not far off from what I got going on here.
[35:34.090 --> 35:36.410]  Really? How is your sleep going these days?
[35:36.470 --> 35:37.170]  How's sleep happen?
[35:38.050 --> 35:39.850]  Oh, it's good.
[35:40.030 --> 35:41.910]  It's it's a learning curve for sure.
[35:42.390 --> 35:46.990]  I was having issues where the pipe would get filled with water
[35:46.990 --> 35:50.190]  because I had the moisture wrong with like the tube thing.
[35:50.310 --> 35:54.210]  So like there's a rainforest cafe in my nose in the middle of the night.
[35:54.210 --> 35:57.810]  It was this huge trial and error process.
[35:58.110 --> 36:00.030]  I would hate to drown by CPAP.
[36:00.850 --> 36:02.650]  Oh, what a terrible way to go.
[36:03.330 --> 36:05.410]  Do you now are you using it every night?
[36:06.070 --> 36:07.950]  Religiously, like you don't ever take a night off.
[36:08.090 --> 36:08.750]  Do you know?
[36:08.830 --> 36:11.310]  Do you think on the whole you're sleeping better, though?
[36:11.750 --> 36:13.430]  So much better. That's great.
[36:14.350 --> 36:15.110]  Insanely better.
[36:19.860 --> 36:23.840]  My so I knew that like I needed a CPAP
[36:23.840 --> 36:26.600]  and I knew that like the way I was sleeping,
[36:26.600 --> 36:29.960]  it was it was blocking my air hole when I'd sleep.
[36:30.320 --> 36:33.840]  And so I would try to manually solve this.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.040]  I went through a run where I'd like try to breathe heavier as I would fall asleep.
[36:39.140 --> 36:41.320]  Like I'd go like, like,
[36:43.280 --> 36:44.920]  and then I'd fall asleep.
[36:45.380 --> 36:47.580]  And this is just the strategy I had.
[36:47.660 --> 36:51.420]  And then I was explaining this once I got like the CPAP machine to my partner.
[36:51.420 --> 36:53.500]  They're like, you were doing that on purpose.
[36:53.700 --> 36:54.760]  That was so annoying.
[36:55.020 --> 36:59.840]  I never complained because I thought that's something that like was just happening.
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.880]  I didn't know that you were purposefully doing that.
[37:03.020 --> 37:03.900]  That sucked.
[37:04.100 --> 37:06.120]  I'm so glad that you're not doing that anymore.
[37:06.520 --> 37:07.240]  That's funny.
[37:07.520 --> 37:10.420]  I felt so bad. I didn't consider he healed.
[37:10.660 --> 37:11.220]  That sucks.
[37:11.420 --> 37:14.640]  Yeah. If you leave the area, they get health back.
[37:14.660 --> 37:17.860]  But maybe I can be a little stinker and.
[37:18.800 --> 37:21.000]  Oh, oh, you got me, too.
[37:21.420 --> 37:22.540]  Oh, he got me, too, though.
[37:23.180 --> 37:25.600]  Yeah. You heal up here. Bandage, bandage. Yeah.
[37:26.820 --> 37:28.900]  Yeah, I'm going to use that bandage technology.
[37:29.500 --> 37:30.360]  He doesn't have that.
[37:31.180 --> 37:33.580]  He does. He just has you leave technology.
[37:35.640 --> 37:39.220]  Nice. This game also has a block button, which I'm sure I'd be so much better
[37:39.220 --> 37:40.980]  if I used it, but I just never do.
[37:41.080 --> 37:42.360]  I'm just always on the attack.
[37:42.620 --> 37:45.720]  I tend to ignore block buttons in all video games.
[37:47.920 --> 37:48.940]  Oh, oh, oh.
[37:49.340 --> 37:50.980]  OK, stand up, stand up.
[37:52.260 --> 37:53.140]  There you go.
[37:54.340 --> 37:54.880]  Take that.
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.880]  It's exciting to kill something like that because you get the parts,
[37:57.940 --> 38:01.160]  you're like, oh, I'll be able to scan it at the base and get more recipes.
[38:02.580 --> 38:05.440]  Dude, another another skeleton over there.
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.340]  Yeah, let's see what they got on them.
[38:08.840 --> 38:10.520]  Listen, I am dead tired.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.200]  Shoe. I'm dead tired.
[38:12.400 --> 38:14.280]  You can't take a shoe. Can you take it for my work?
[38:15.340 --> 38:16.560]  Oh, no, I can't.
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.880]  In the taming program,
[38:18.400 --> 38:22.120]  it's like they don't even care if we succeed in riding insects.
[38:22.960 --> 38:26.940]  They're hiding the eggs so they could steal my hatchery design.
[38:27.720 --> 38:28.520]  Oh, I know it.
[38:29.860 --> 38:32.520]  Well, I can hide my work, too.
[38:34.180 --> 38:36.500]  Nobody would think to look here.
[38:38.420 --> 38:42.720]  OK, well, I think a soldier did think to look there,
[38:42.940 --> 38:44.240]  unfortunately for them.
[38:46.700 --> 38:47.800]  Anything else in here?
[38:47.980 --> 38:48.580]  I think we're all good.
[38:49.380 --> 38:50.340]  I was pretty fruitful.
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.500]  I really appreciate.
[38:53.700 --> 38:54.240]  So essentially,
[38:56.260 --> 38:59.800]  this park has a bunch of research labs under it where they're doing experiments
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.480]  and stuff, so it's fun to like
[39:02.540 --> 39:07.040]  encounter those and learn about a little bit about what's happening in different areas.
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.580]  It's a little bit, you know, it taps into like a Jurassic Park feel to me.
[39:12.660 --> 39:15.340]  We're like, oh, there's shit that went wrong here,
[39:15.340 --> 39:19.360]  as well as a little bit of like the Dharma initiative stations and loss.
[39:19.640 --> 39:20.520]  Like, I like that.
[39:20.680 --> 39:22.640]  I definitely get that vibe.
[39:22.720 --> 39:24.920]  Yeah, I just think outposts.
[39:24.980 --> 39:26.980]  God, I wish we had more Dharma initiative.
[39:28.260 --> 39:28.900]  There are a lot of.
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.540]  It was maybe my favorite, like, hook to last later season.
[39:34.660 --> 39:36.860]  The only time there was a new like hatch or whatever.
[39:37.700 --> 39:38.380]  So exciting.
[39:38.900 --> 39:39.320]  Absolutely.
[39:39.540 --> 39:43.260]  They did such a good job with that part of it while they did.
[39:44.380 --> 39:44.780]  Yeah.
[39:46.980 --> 39:53.220]  So this is the thing I encounter sometimes where like I'll follow the objective and it's below where I need to be.
[39:55.400 --> 39:59.160]  Okay, let me figure out how to get down there, which is just in the research base.
[40:03.120 --> 40:04.360]  Does this game have boss fights?
[40:05.440 --> 40:06.280]  Oh, yeah, it does.
[40:06.280 --> 40:08.560]  But there's some gems in the mess.
[40:11.560 --> 40:13.940]  First one had some brutal boss fights.
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.100]  I didn't really encounter them.
[40:21.700 --> 40:22.960]  Sure did. They're dead.
[40:32.720 --> 40:35.180]  Uh oh. I found a body in an anthill.
[40:38.140 --> 40:39.020]  Oh, gosh.
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.720]  I will make arrangements with our funerary services.
[40:42.040 --> 40:42.620]  No, she won't.
[40:42.660 --> 40:43.540]  Thank you for letting me know.
[40:44.640 --> 40:46.120]  I know what I'm being bastard.
[40:47.340 --> 40:48.860]  I work with you assholes.
[40:49.020 --> 40:49.980]  I know what I'm like.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.080]  That's so tragic.
[40:52.800 --> 40:54.000]  Let's not dwell on it.
[40:54.160 --> 40:56.960]  Let's move on. Let's talk about the business needs.
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.900]  Listen, I won't bore you with the details, but we ran experiments on insect taming.
[41:02.600 --> 41:05.720]  The installations were set up right near the onboarding facility.
[41:06.280 --> 41:07.360]  Inside an anthill.
[41:07.540 --> 41:08.920]  It might come in handy.
[41:09.260 --> 41:11.340]  We might be able to complete this research.
[41:12.080 --> 41:13.180]  All the burgle, though.
[41:13.280 --> 41:13.800]  Nothing so far.
[41:13.900 --> 41:14.720]  I don't care about any of this.
[41:14.820 --> 41:15.880]  Why not? Give me some burgle.
[41:16.100 --> 41:17.340]  Domestication method in the meantime.
[41:18.420 --> 41:19.300]  That's the spirit.
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.020]  First, you'll have to get this new blueprint from the rain.
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.460]  Oh, yeah. Employees exchange raw science for.
[41:25.400 --> 41:25.620]  OK.
[41:27.080 --> 41:28.260]  Buy some blueprints.
[41:30.960 --> 41:31.400]  Hatchery.
[41:31.800 --> 41:33.020]  And riding it around.
[41:33.460 --> 41:36.540]  We would be a multi story bases yet.
[41:36.660 --> 41:38.740]  Now we're close.
[41:38.880 --> 41:40.420]  We just need 20 more science points.
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.940]  We need to get 20 science points and we can go find some.
[41:43.540 --> 41:45.540]  I want to build a hatchery that I want to show you.
[41:45.620 --> 41:46.560]  Do you have anything to scan?
[41:49.180 --> 41:50.640]  Yeah, I'll do that in a second.
[41:50.700 --> 41:52.200]  I'll just put it to see this hatchery first.
[41:52.700 --> 41:56.580]  Park down. So this is how we breed our Pokemon stem.
[41:57.380 --> 41:58.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[41:59.000 --> 41:59.520]  Uh.
[42:01.060 --> 42:01.980]  Let me put.
[42:02.740 --> 42:04.060]  We put the might for us.
[42:04.260 --> 42:05.320]  That's not wanting me to.
[42:06.660 --> 42:08.520]  Suddenly the acorns are necessary.
[42:09.060 --> 42:11.500]  Yep. Acorns have come into play.
[42:16.900 --> 42:18.460]  Green power up. Oh, yeah.
[42:19.580 --> 42:20.720]  I wish it was so easy.
[42:21.980 --> 42:22.860]  Oh, man.
[42:23.600 --> 42:27.420]  Did you imagine if I if you could still level up
[42:27.960 --> 42:30.420]  like at some point, we're not we can't level up anymore?
[42:30.420 --> 42:32.220]  I don't think I get to level up anymore.
[42:32.320 --> 42:33.520]  You know? Yeah.
[42:34.420 --> 42:37.740]  Like maybe I can get back to some base stats that I let slip,
[42:37.900 --> 42:40.200]  but I think I don't think I'm going above base.
[42:41.940 --> 42:44.020]  No, I would actually be terrified
[42:44.020 --> 42:46.820]  if I could find out what my brain score was currently.
[42:46.960 --> 42:49.800]  Yeah, not good. I don't think I want to know.
[42:51.420 --> 42:54.060]  Although I do wish that it was as easy to level up
[42:54.060 --> 42:56.340]  as like just bringing new items to a machine.
[43:00.560 --> 43:02.040]  Ready to break up a sweat.
[43:03.760 --> 43:04.640]  Oh, I'm hungry.
[43:05.080 --> 43:06.980]  Let's get some snacking going.
[43:08.660 --> 43:09.640]  You medium rare guy?
[43:10.240 --> 43:11.520]  Yes, I am. For your sticks?
[43:11.520 --> 43:12.920]  Yeah. And you?
[43:14.580 --> 43:19.080]  I definitely grew up in a house of well done, but I have I'm a medium rare person.
[43:19.260 --> 43:23.120]  I also grew up in a well done house and became medium rare on my own.
[43:23.500 --> 43:24.240]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[43:25.580 --> 43:29.620]  It is a thing where it's like every chef says you should eat it this way.
[43:29.620 --> 43:31.160]  I feel like they probably know.
[43:31.880 --> 43:33.880]  I'm absolutely like.
[43:34.060 --> 43:34.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[43:35.400 --> 43:38.820]  I'm in the process of trying to Emily and I are trying to convince ourselves.
[43:40.320 --> 43:44.140]  I don't I have a pretty nice grill, but I don't grill anymore
[43:44.760 --> 43:46.900]  or very often because
[43:47.680 --> 43:50.640]  the reality is now that Millie's off in school
[43:50.640 --> 43:53.460]  and we don't like have parties or anything. Sure.
[43:54.180 --> 43:55.480]  It's just Emily and I.
[43:55.620 --> 43:58.720]  And so we probably share a steak, right?
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.280]  If we if we if I wanted to do a grill night,
[44:02.440 --> 44:06.440]  maybe like some Brussels sprouts or something as well.
[44:07.240 --> 44:09.640]  It's like you pull the grill out, you clean it.
[44:09.760 --> 44:15.060]  You put 45 minutes into getting it up to temperature with the briquettes
[44:15.820 --> 44:19.420]  and then you grill for seven to eight minutes
[44:19.420 --> 44:22.980]  and then you have to, you know, tear it down again.
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.620]  And it's just so much work for two people that I find myself never grilling anymore.
[44:28.240 --> 44:32.540]  But her dad, we were just up in Michigan, had a Ninja electric grill.
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.940]  It's like the modern version of the George Foreman. OK.
[44:36.380 --> 44:40.360]  And I think I might I think I might be interested in your back in.
[44:40.740 --> 44:43.540]  Yeah, because I do want to cook steak all the time.
[44:43.640 --> 44:44.980]  I want to grill chicken all the time.
[44:45.060 --> 44:49.320]  I just don't want to go through all the hassle for sure for that little amount of food.
[44:49.740 --> 44:53.920]  But with the electric thing, man, it's just like it's also like an air fryer, too.
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.360]  Not that I need any more of those in my life.
[44:55.360 --> 44:58.360]  Everything I own has an air fryer in it, it feels like in 2025.
[44:58.720 --> 45:02.920]  Yes. But just to be able to turn on an outside grill and grill a couple of steaks
[45:02.920 --> 45:06.540]  and turn it off and not have to deal with, you know, charcoal.
[45:06.780 --> 45:08.160]  And I don't have a gas grill.
[45:08.200 --> 45:09.320]  Otherwise, that'd be much easier.
[45:09.380 --> 45:11.340]  But I don't know. I'm thinking about it.
[45:11.380 --> 45:15.300]  It's just. At some point, you're like, it's just another fucking thing
[45:15.300 --> 45:17.940]  to own, another purchase to make. Sure, absolutely.
[45:18.760 --> 45:22.180]  It's also a thing where I feel like for it to make sense for you and Emily,
[45:22.680 --> 45:24.660]  you need to really become a grill guy.
[45:24.660 --> 45:28.200]  Like you need to get invested in like, I'm going to try different sear methods.
[45:28.560 --> 45:30.700]  I'm going to like experiment in all these ways.
[45:30.760 --> 45:32.600]  Like it becomes more than just about cooking.
[45:33.120 --> 45:35.260]  You like, OK, weed stems or 20.
[45:37.980 --> 45:40.800]  Uh, this is the laziest fucking joke ever made.
[45:41.300 --> 45:43.420]  Everybody like, Oh my God, Ray's hilarious.
[45:44.280 --> 45:48.520]  Is there is there any non lazy number based jokes?
[45:48.680 --> 45:49.620]  No, all number based.
[45:49.920 --> 45:53.620]  I think I would argue that they're all kind of lazy and they're all beggars.
[45:53.620 --> 45:56.400]  They all hit. Ray is also hilarious, by the way.
[46:00.420 --> 46:02.000]  It's all in the delivery anyway.
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.320]  Absolutely. Yeah. Timing delivery.
[46:04.940 --> 46:05.800]  Yeah, I know what you mean.
[46:05.860 --> 46:09.340]  Like, I just I don't use the grill I have.
[46:09.420 --> 46:12.640]  So I'm trying to convince myself that if I buy a different grill, I'll use it.
[46:12.820 --> 46:15.840]  And that almost never plays out the way you think it does.
[46:17.780 --> 46:20.880]  But no, but I mean, what you're describing makes sense, though,
[46:20.900 --> 46:22.280]  where it's like it's a timing thing.
[46:22.280 --> 46:25.300]  And if that really reduces how much time and prep is required.
[46:25.620 --> 46:30.020]  Yeah, I just I have a problem with barriers to entry.
[46:30.560 --> 46:32.300]  That's beautiful. That looks good.
[46:33.660 --> 46:34.400]  For more of this.
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.180]  I don't want if there's too much of a barrier to entry to do the thing,
[46:38.220 --> 46:39.360]  I just won't do it.
[46:40.360 --> 46:41.140]  Totally. Yeah.
[46:42.660 --> 46:44.260]  And like the whole idea of life.
[46:44.660 --> 46:45.820]  Did you did you try?
[46:46.100 --> 46:49.860]  Did you like eat up some steak or like some chicken off of one of these?
[46:49.900 --> 46:50.820]  Or did you just see it?
[46:51.600 --> 46:52.460]  Emily's dad has it.
[46:52.520 --> 46:53.440]  And so we used it.
[46:53.820 --> 46:55.360]  OK, for sure. And it was good.
[46:56.040 --> 46:56.880]  If it's good. Yeah.
[46:57.020 --> 46:59.880]  Well, then, you know, we cooked and you enjoy the taste.
[47:00.220 --> 47:02.100]  Yeah, we cooked chicken on and it was awesome.
[47:02.240 --> 47:05.900]  And it was it was definitely handy dandy, you know, kind of thing. Sure.
[47:06.840 --> 47:09.880]  These are the these are the problems you'll face when you turn 50.
[47:10.060 --> 47:11.840]  Andrew, just, you know,
[47:12.880 --> 47:14.800]  what kind of they're now in my own way.
[47:15.260 --> 47:16.860]  I get excited about.
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.240]  Uh, I started looking at shower heads one day and just be like,
[47:22.520 --> 47:23.240]  where are we?
[47:23.760 --> 47:25.240]  There's probably some innovation here.
[47:25.440 --> 47:27.200]  What's going on in the showerhead world?
[47:27.820 --> 47:31.920]  Emily got on showerhead tick tock a while back and she bought a showerhead
[47:31.920 --> 47:34.020]  for us that is pretty fucking awesome.
[47:34.120 --> 47:35.320]  I got a I got it.
[47:35.540 --> 47:38.800]  Let me know what you what you land on.
[47:40.160 --> 47:42.680]  It's not we need weed stems.
[47:44.180 --> 47:45.660]  Take my take my weed stems.
[47:45.660 --> 47:46.640]  I don't know why it's not.
[47:47.940 --> 47:50.060]  I have weed stems for you, please.
[47:50.720 --> 47:51.800]  I got a look in it.
[47:51.900 --> 47:54.020]  I see. OK, that's what's happening.
[47:54.080 --> 47:55.920]  I'm not I'm just like looking at the completed part.
[47:55.960 --> 47:58.600]  I didn't realize that the like look at where it goes missing.
[47:58.880 --> 47:59.660]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.320]  I, uh, I get really irrationally excited on tick tock
[48:07.320 --> 48:12.440]  for things that are like this concrete solids up way faster.
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.400]  And it's like I personally have no use for it.
[48:14.400 --> 48:18.580]  But I get tick tocks of like people at trade shows
[48:18.580 --> 48:23.800]  for construction stuff or just like building equipment and going like,
[48:23.940 --> 48:25.060]  oh, that's fucking awesome.
[48:25.700 --> 48:27.160]  That paint is crazy.
[48:27.260 --> 48:28.480]  That paint works so well.
[48:28.700 --> 48:30.200]  That hole is instantly gone.
[48:30.440 --> 48:34.020]  Like I dude, I feel like I'm deep in the old person.
[48:34.140 --> 48:35.760]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[48:35.840 --> 48:39.480]  Yesterday, I got caught in a loop watching this guy
[48:39.480 --> 48:42.740]  explain the different ways you can pressure treat lumber.
[48:45.780 --> 48:49.340]  And the different kinds of lumber and ratings of pressure
[48:49.340 --> 48:53.240]  treating and then ratings of the joists that you use to connect them.
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.080]  And I probably watched 35 minutes of just this guy staring
[48:57.080 --> 49:00.360]  at the edge of a piece of wood and like showing how to paint it.
[49:01.160 --> 49:02.780]  Oh, man, I'm right there with you.
[49:04.400 --> 49:05.380]  Let's get this going.
[49:05.900 --> 49:11.560]  I will never pressure treat wood and build a deck myself again in my life, but.
[49:13.020 --> 49:13.480]  No.
[49:15.140 --> 49:16.320]  No, it's a lot of work.
[49:16.620 --> 49:19.660]  If I were to, I would know I would know exactly the pressure
[49:19.660 --> 49:22.760]  treating scenarios that I would want to create for myself.
[49:23.060 --> 49:25.420]  Sprigs I needed. I think I needed sprigs. Yeah.
[49:28.100 --> 49:29.640]  Check out some sprigs.
[49:30.200 --> 49:31.800]  OK, well, here. Easy.
[49:32.220 --> 49:34.540]  One, two. You collecting anything right now?
[49:37.600 --> 49:39.000]  Not really, no.
[49:40.460 --> 49:44.400]  I have this Pokemon game on my phone where you can open two packs a day
[49:44.400 --> 49:49.420]  and that keeps the beast away of actually spending money on cards, which is nice.
[49:49.700 --> 49:53.360]  Yeah, well, I know you were getting into graded movies for a while
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.380]  and then you had video games for a bit, too.
[49:55.660 --> 50:00.400]  Yeah, it's it's becomes a thing, like you said, where it's it's space.
[50:00.400 --> 50:05.020]  Like, yeah, it's incredibly, you know, being able to afford
[50:05.020 --> 50:08.360]  something is incredibly nice, but then it's another layer of like, OK, I can.
[50:08.360 --> 50:09.420]  This is on sale.
[50:09.540 --> 50:13.100]  This is really cheap, but like this has to physically exist somewhere
[50:13.100 --> 50:14.820]  and I just don't have the room for it.
[50:14.940 --> 50:19.740]  So, yeah, I try to I try to adhere to a rule I had for Millie
[50:19.740 --> 50:23.500]  when she was a kid where I would go over to other people's houses
[50:23.500 --> 50:26.780]  and the entire house was just toys on the ground.
[50:27.020 --> 50:29.980]  And I always was like, I do not want to live in that kind of clutter.
[50:30.940 --> 50:36.120]  Yeah. And I was also like, how many toys can a kid genuinely play with?
[50:36.180 --> 50:37.520]  Millie had a bunch of toys,
[50:37.520 --> 50:39.520]  but I felt like we never went past that critical mass.
[50:39.700 --> 50:43.920]  And so we had a rule where if Millie got a new toy, any new toy that came in,
[50:43.960 --> 50:45.880]  an old toy had to go out and be donated.
[50:46.100 --> 50:51.000]  And I am trying to maintain that balance with my collections, too, but it's hard.
[50:52.600 --> 50:55.780]  It's much easier to hold somebody else to that than yourself.
[50:57.520 --> 51:00.040]  I've kind of gone through a little bit of an existential crisis
[51:00.040 --> 51:01.980]  with my collecting as well.
[51:02.580 --> 51:05.540]  This is a very morbid thought, but like when you're collecting stuff,
[51:05.640 --> 51:06.940]  everything is so expensive.
[51:06.940 --> 51:08.720]  Yeah. You're looking for a deal.
[51:09.200 --> 51:13.460]  You're like looking for somebody selling something that maybe they don't know
[51:13.460 --> 51:16.760]  what it's worth or just like they just want to get rid of it.
[51:17.080 --> 51:18.560]  They're sick of it being in the space.
[51:19.020 --> 51:22.560]  And I had this realization that I'm building a collection.
[51:23.100 --> 51:27.620]  I'm like building a thing that I'm looking for somebody else's
[51:27.620 --> 51:29.820]  like somebody else to have to die with.
[51:29.960 --> 51:35.260]  Yeah. Like I realized that I'm like I am the person I'm looking for is me.
[51:35.260 --> 51:38.760]  And every time I buy something, I'm becoming more of that person.
[51:39.020 --> 51:45.240]  Yes. And it creates this weird factoring in of like, I'm going to eventually die.
[51:45.980 --> 51:50.640]  What what am I doing with the like these are what does this bring me?
[51:50.660 --> 51:54.020]  Join this moment like it has become a little bit of a crisis for me
[51:54.020 --> 51:57.560]  where I'm trying to like come up with a purpose for having these things
[51:57.560 --> 51:58.960]  beyond just they look nice.
[51:59.500 --> 52:02.840]  It's weird. It's a weird thing to to to reconcile.
[52:02.840 --> 52:05.380]  I do know what you mean, because I have felt that similarly, too,
[52:05.460 --> 52:07.920]  because, you know, Emily goes to a ton of estate sales
[52:07.920 --> 52:10.520]  and that's like you're just walking through dead people's shit
[52:10.520 --> 52:14.680]  or somebody is going into a home or assisted living
[52:14.680 --> 52:16.060]  and they just don't have room for all the stuff.
[52:16.140 --> 52:17.780]  But it's never like a positive.
[52:18.200 --> 52:20.000]  It's never like, oh, we're getting rid of all this stuff
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.460]  because we got even more stuff somewhere else. Yes.
[52:23.060 --> 52:26.840]  And so you're basically building a collection on other people's
[52:26.840 --> 52:27.780]  like what you were saying.
[52:28.020 --> 52:29.400]  You're either trying to find a deal.
[52:31.360 --> 52:35.380]  Or you're so you're either you're essentially building a collection
[52:35.380 --> 52:39.600]  based on other people's either ignorance in what they have or desperation
[52:40.240 --> 52:42.600]  to get rid of it. Yes.
[52:42.720 --> 52:45.380]  And it's kind of a bummer when you think about it in those times.
[52:45.620 --> 52:49.300]  Absolutely. And then also, as you go through, I think about this.
[52:49.420 --> 52:52.040]  Every fucking estate sale I walk through, we went through one in Michigan
[52:52.040 --> 52:55.120]  the other day, and you're just like you look around and think
[52:55.120 --> 52:57.600]  and all this stuff mattered to the person who lived here
[52:57.600 --> 53:00.880]  and means next to nothing to anybody else on Earth
[53:00.880 --> 53:03.900]  and definitely not to other people in their lives or they would have removed it.
[53:04.600 --> 53:08.620]  You're just everything that you own is creating a problem
[53:08.620 --> 53:12.940]  for the family members in your life that have to take care of it when you're gone.
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.520]  And it is like a weird thing, too, where they had that David Lynch estate sale,
[53:18.560 --> 53:22.040]  and it's really cool the idea of like, oh, this mug was owned by David Lynch.
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.100]  But it also is a weird thing of like, I own this mug because he died
[53:26.100 --> 53:30.840]  and I'm a huge fan of his and I don't necessarily want to think about that
[53:30.840 --> 53:32.400]  every time I look at this mug.
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.560]  I'm right there with you.
[53:34.700 --> 53:36.560]  I count myself as a massive David.
[53:36.620 --> 53:39.180]  Oh, it sucks as a massive David Lynch fan, right?
[53:39.340 --> 53:44.180]  But and I looked at every item in that auction
[53:44.860 --> 53:48.000]  and I was blown away by some of the stuff and I was interested
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.440]  in some of the stuff, some of the scripts and I could have potentially swung.
[53:51.440 --> 53:55.120]  But just something felt I don't know why,
[53:55.440 --> 53:58.360]  because I will definitely go through an estate sale and if I find baseball cards,
[53:58.400 --> 53:58.820]  I'll buy them.
[53:59.140 --> 54:00.800]  And that's essentially the digital version of that.
[54:00.920 --> 54:03.980]  But something just didn't feel right to me about it.
[54:04.060 --> 54:05.920]  And I didn't want to participate in it.
[54:06.460 --> 54:07.500]  That's very fair.
[54:07.640 --> 54:12.740]  That didn't didn't make me feel like I didn't look down on people who did or anything.
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.680]  I don't feel like high minded about it.
[54:14.700 --> 54:19.500]  I just like it just felt wrong to me to own David Lynch's stuff in that way.
[54:19.500 --> 54:22.000]  Like, I would love to own a coffee mug that David Lynch owned,
[54:22.100 --> 54:24.640]  but I would love for David Lynch to give it to me.
[54:26.780 --> 54:27.580]  Yes. Yeah.
[54:27.680 --> 54:29.520]  I mean, that's really that's really weird.
[54:30.020 --> 54:34.920]  I don't think you want to know the dead people's stuff, whose stuff you have,
[54:35.380 --> 54:36.920]  even if it's somebody you looked up to.
[54:38.140 --> 54:41.320]  Yeah, I think you want David Lynch to know you have this mug.
[54:41.560 --> 54:41.720]  Yeah.
[54:44.240 --> 54:45.920]  Let's let's start building a little bit.
[54:46.060 --> 54:47.340]  Let's do it. Let's find an area.
[54:47.420 --> 54:48.060]  Let's craft.
[54:49.100 --> 54:51.480]  So I was trying to do, but I would need to get more armor and stuff,
[54:51.520 --> 54:54.640]  I think, to survive there is they got rid of zip lines, which were a big part
[54:54.640 --> 54:55.340]  of the first game.
[54:55.520 --> 54:56.860]  But now you get mounts.
[54:56.940 --> 54:59.200]  You can have like ant mounts and they're so cool.
[54:59.280 --> 55:00.560]  You can run around the map with them.
[55:00.640 --> 55:01.320]  They can gather.
[55:01.660 --> 55:02.580]  They're like a backpack.
[55:03.500 --> 55:04.360]  They are great.
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.260]  Can they can they climb vertically?
[55:07.420 --> 55:08.640]  Yeah, that's a little bit.
[55:08.720 --> 55:11.660]  I mean, like they can't climb up walls, but like if you need to jump up stuff,
[55:12.020 --> 55:12.800]  that's a problem.
[55:12.900 --> 55:15.200]  That's a big that's a real problem.
[55:16.060 --> 55:19.600]  You can get the ladybug to fight the spider.
[55:19.800 --> 55:21.360]  Looks like it wants to see.
[55:22.880 --> 55:23.640]  Hey, ladybug.
[55:24.860 --> 55:25.860]  Oh, that's a big one.
[55:26.100 --> 55:27.760]  We're not building camp near these spiders.
[55:28.160 --> 55:30.220]  No, I think maybe we go closer to where we were.
[55:30.260 --> 55:31.180]  It seems kind of safe.
[55:32.960 --> 55:33.580]  Let's scout out.
[55:34.160 --> 55:37.300]  Let's get out an area and see if we can find something.
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.920]  That's where I died.
[55:40.200 --> 55:41.760]  Are there any materials you can't build on?
[55:41.760 --> 55:44.820]  Like, could we build on water or water?
[55:45.860 --> 55:46.380]  Let's see.
[55:46.520 --> 55:47.600]  I don't know that I want to understand.
[55:48.220 --> 55:50.500]  Yeah, I haven't really tried that.
[55:50.600 --> 55:50.980]  Let's see.
[55:51.840 --> 55:52.200]  That's.
[55:54.740 --> 55:57.780]  We got a floor, we got doors, walls.
[55:57.920 --> 55:58.900]  I guess we don't really need a floor.
[55:58.940 --> 55:59.580]  We got floor everywhere.
[55:59.680 --> 56:00.500]  Let's try a wall.
[56:02.540 --> 56:03.480]  A building combat.
[56:04.140 --> 56:04.420]  Shit.
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.240]  All these stupid mites.
[56:07.760 --> 56:08.720]  Get out of here.
[56:09.480 --> 56:10.840]  Once again, covered in goo.
[56:11.360 --> 56:12.860]  Oh, I'm just goo city.
[56:14.440 --> 56:14.900]  OK.
[56:19.850 --> 56:20.730]  Grass wall.
[56:21.430 --> 56:22.030]  We should make it.
[56:22.290 --> 56:22.710]  Yeah, we can build water.
[56:23.070 --> 56:26.350]  We should make it so that everybody you can't tell that there's water
[56:26.350 --> 56:30.310]  from the outside of the house and you go in and it's a fully normal house.
[56:30.430 --> 56:33.910]  But then when Gavin opens the door to his bedroom, it's just a pit of water.
[56:34.930 --> 56:37.590]  OK, so we build out from here, right?
[56:37.830 --> 56:38.530]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:38.630 --> 56:40.150]  OK, let's.
[56:40.150 --> 56:46.750]  Well, let's let's build Gavin's room first, so we want it right on the edge of the water.
[56:48.010 --> 56:50.550]  Everybody else, everybody else gets floors and shit.
[56:54.490 --> 56:55.870]  And that's Gavin's room.
[56:56.010 --> 56:56.570]  Yeah, I love that.
[57:09.850 --> 57:10.290]  Diagonal.
[57:12.190 --> 57:15.470]  I guess we can't build there, so let's start going inward.
[57:18.130 --> 57:20.670]  I bet it would be really loud if you were small.
[57:21.810 --> 57:23.690]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[57:23.870 --> 57:24.630]  It would be my drive.
[57:24.670 --> 57:25.050]  You crazy.
[57:25.130 --> 57:27.570]  Be like before Daredevil learned how to shut things out.
[57:32.670 --> 57:33.610]  Why is it?
[57:35.490 --> 57:36.490]  OK, here we go.
[57:38.590 --> 57:39.370]  Some more grass.
[57:46.200 --> 57:50.140]  What's the biggest repair you've done on a place that you've lived in?
[57:50.720 --> 57:52.720]  Most substantial thing you've done yourself.
[57:53.360 --> 57:54.540]  Myself or just done?
[57:56.580 --> 57:58.500]  Uh, done yourself.
[57:58.860 --> 58:02.240]  Uh, I've done a lot of bathroom work, you know?
[58:02.400 --> 58:04.840]  OK, I've replaced a pedestal sink before.
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.960]  I've done some.
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.740]  Not a lot of I've never done tile work or anything.
[58:16.220 --> 58:16.900]  Hmm.
[58:19.440 --> 58:20.340]  I've built.
[58:20.620 --> 58:21.260]  Here we go.
[58:21.680 --> 58:22.900]  I built a few fences.
[58:24.960 --> 58:29.100]  Like we were talking about, yeah, I've built a couple of fences like wooden fences.
[58:29.280 --> 58:34.020]  Yeah, like you have Home Depot deliver all the boards and then you do the plumb line
[58:34.020 --> 58:37.660]  and you'd like put the concrete in the ground and make the post.
[58:37.840 --> 58:41.500]  And then you line all the fence posts up and you put like a nail between them
[58:41.500 --> 58:44.620]  to give them a nail and then you like use the electric nail gun to go like.
[58:45.780 --> 58:48.440]  Yeah, I built I built a fence around my first house
[58:48.440 --> 58:51.220]  or I rather I had a fence go bad and I replaced it.
[58:53.240 --> 58:54.460]  That's that's cool.
[58:54.560 --> 58:55.840]  I have a fun thing.
[58:55.960 --> 58:58.440]  Did it suck at all rewarding?
[58:58.640 --> 59:00.320]  Dude, it's yes, it sucked.
[59:00.460 --> 59:01.240]  Yes, it was rewarding.
[59:01.340 --> 59:03.780]  I was twenty four, maybe twenty five.
[59:04.000 --> 59:05.220]  I just got the house.
[59:05.580 --> 59:09.180]  I was young and full of energy and I was also broke.
[59:09.520 --> 59:12.360]  So doing it myself was the only way it was going to get done.
[59:12.520 --> 59:13.740]  You know? Yeah.
[59:14.680 --> 59:20.260]  I I've probably done something here or there that's more intensive than that,
[59:20.260 --> 59:21.800]  but I genuinely can't remember it.
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.260]  I mean, a beanhole is pretty intensive.
[59:24.500 --> 59:26.800]  That's true. Yeah, I've been hold a lot of work.
[59:28.940 --> 59:32.440]  But really, I'm liking the feel of Gavin's room quite a bit.
[59:32.520 --> 59:36.000]  Thanks, man. I think I think that's pretty, pretty rad, right?
[59:36.580 --> 59:38.180]  I think we're really on to something here.
[59:38.980 --> 59:40.920]  Yeah, let's go on to you.
[59:41.700 --> 59:44.640]  I also love the idea that mites just burrow out and attack him in his sleep.
[59:47.340 --> 59:48.160]  Where's the door?
[59:48.300 --> 59:50.400]  OK, we need a grass door. Beautiful.
[59:51.800 --> 59:53.640]  He doesn't get a roof, I don't think.
[59:53.740 --> 59:56.540]  I think this should just be how it is.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.180]  We need sprigs, glass bank, weed stem.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:03.720]  Rage it.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.180]  420.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.420]  I just say rage and flip it.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:18.070]  And spill this.
[01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:22.090]  Where's some weeds?
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:23.870]  Where's some sprigs? Sprig, easy.
[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.710]  Weeds, weeds, weeds.
[01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.610]  Is that one?
[01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:32.770]  I don't think so. I think that's the grass.
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.630]  That's the weed. Yeah.
[01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.710]  It's like dandelions we're looking for.
[01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:41.750]  Where are you hiding?
[01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.890]  Oh, here we go.
[01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:45.590]  The only yard in the world with no weeds.
[01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:52.350]  Man, some stems.
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.770]  That's something I don't miss.
[01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.130]  I had a zero scaped yard at my old house.
[01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:59.390]  And just because it's so fucking hot in Texas, you know?
[01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:04.890]  But even with that, just weeds constantly coming up out of the rocks.
[01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:09.250]  And then it looks like immediate shit, like all it's like a field of rocks
[01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.610]  and then one green ass weed.
[01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:14.390]  And so I spent six years just walking around that front yard,
[01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:16.670]  weeding twice a day, probably
[01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:22.390]  every day, beating them back or pouring down poison.
[01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.090]  It's an exhaustive process that feels like it will never end.
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.410]  I like this a lot.
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.930]  I don't miss that part of owning homes for sure.
[01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.750]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:34.910]  That's his little little house.
[01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.490]  Let's move the bed.
[01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:40.490]  He deserves a bed.
[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.770]  Dude, if you can put the bed in the water, I would be.
[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.330]  I will be so happy.
[01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:47.410]  Yeah, let's move this bed.
[01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.270]  Relocate.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.720]  Run it back over.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.820]  Please let me put it in the water.
[01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.710]  Oh, it's obstructed.
[01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:10.690]  Damn it.
[01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:15.810]  Maybe we can get a blueprint for a floor or something and then make that work.
[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.330]  Yeah, we'll figure that out at some other point in the meantime.
[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:20.670]  I want to sleep. I want to get the morning.
[01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:22.050]  I want to get out of the dark.
[01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:25.970]  Let's let's try to kill something way bigger than us
[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:26.930]  that we shouldn't be able to kill.
[01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:28.490]  And then maybe we wrap it here.
[01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:29.910]  All right. So suicide mission.
[01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:31.530]  Let's do suicide.
[01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:34.910]  I like the work we've put into Gavin's room.
[01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:38.710]  We've finalized this thing.
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.310]  I like the idea of us loading in and being like, Gavin, you're a number.
[01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:42.190]  You're number one.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:43.870]  You know, we prioritize you.
[01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:45.050]  We need you to be safe.
[01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.310]  So you're the we only built your room.
[01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.630]  We closed the door.
[01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:50.210]  So it's a little bit of a surprise.
[01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.870]  Oh, it is the fun thing.
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.770]  Once we have four people playing this, people being able to, like,
[01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:01.990]  go off and do their own roles like I'm typically not someone who enjoys
[01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:03.310]  building a base. Yeah.
[01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:05.050]  I'll like go scavenge stuff.
[01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:05.990]  Someone else can build it.
[01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:09.330]  I know when I played grounded one, that was very much like the people
[01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.150]  I played with all had our own roles.
[01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.710]  I feel like Nick would get into building.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.010]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
[01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:19.190]  Something I really like about games like this were there
[01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:22.530]  all these sort of different systems in which you can have fun
[01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:26.730]  and being able to lean into what resonates the most with you.
[01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.950]  I'd love that little snack.
[01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:32.750]  Pretty beautiful.
[01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.050]  All my stuff is in the cave, but.
[01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:37.670]  Where's the threat?
[01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:42.730]  Where's that?
[01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:44.710]  Let's see if we can get grub meat.
[01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:46.650]  Hey, friend.
[01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.050]  No meat. Shit.
[01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:53.050]  OK, well, when you dig these up, we are either going to get grub,
[01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.410]  stono grub meat or something that can really fuck us up.
[01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.570]  Let's keep rolling the dice.
[01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.150]  Then we get some meat.
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.610]  That's it. That's it. Dice rolled.
[01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:04.750]  That was the bad dice.
[01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.950]  Oh, no.
[01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:10.510]  Oh, oh, it's all it's that you got it at about 75% health.
[01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:11.430]  OK.
[01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.050]  Oh, there's this.
[01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.630]  Oh, that's that's another cool thing you can do.
[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:18.910]  Where you can like click, why go into your binoculars?
[01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.570]  And then you can like ping them and you learn what their weaknesses are.
[01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.450]  You get like little little training cards.
[01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.350]  Oh, he jumped.
[01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:27.090]  I'm going up. I'm going up.
[01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.870]  Get away.
[01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:32.470]  Go get a hobby.
[01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:36.850]  Go go build a fence for your home that needs it.
[01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.210]  Well, you wanted a.
[01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.170]  Did you wanted a challenge?
[01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:43.210]  See if we can sneak out of here.
[01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:48.290]  This way.
[01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.950]  Oh, I missed.
[01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.510]  No, that's bad.
[01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:54.030]  That's going to be that's going to go badly.
[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:55.310]  Go fall down.
[01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.130]  Oh, the full damage.
[01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.870]  We lose them.
[01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:02.770]  I think we lost them.
[01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:03.410]  I think we're OK.
[01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.510]  Oh, OK.
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.770]  Rub.
[01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.730]  No, not again.
[01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:18.730]  That's great, too.
[01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.250]  I'm really excited to play it as a group of four.
[01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.450]  That was really chill.
[01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.350]  It is a really just like fun, relaxing game.
[01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:28.170]  And once you get deeper into the story, like it really hooks you.
[01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:29.910]  At least that's how Grand and one was for me.
[01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.650]  And in my four or five hours playing solo,
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:35.010]  I'm definitely very intrigued as to what's happening.
[01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:36.910]  These are really fun games.
[01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.730]  I'm really excited.
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:38.610]  They made a second one.
[01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:42.050]  I wasn't expecting there to be another one necessarily, especially so soon.
[01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.850]  Yeah, but Obsidian once again, killing it.
[01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:46.630]  I really like Devoud. I like this.
[01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.570]  I'm so excited for the Outer Worlds 2.
[01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:50.850]  That's coming out soon.
[01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:52.090]  Oh, wow. That's right.
[01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:53.270]  Forgot about that stuff.
[01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:54.790]  But yeah, this is grand, too.
[01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:55.870]  I can't wait for it to release,
[01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:58.750]  which will be the day that this video comes out.
[01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.750]  Once again, thank you so much to Xbox for giving us early access
[01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.870]  so we can make this ahead of time.
[01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:04.170]  I can show it to you, Geoff.
[01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.610]  This has been so much fun.
[01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.830]  Thanks for hanging out with me today.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.510]  I had a blast looking at some parks.
[01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.650]  Can't wait to do this with everybody.
[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.470]  Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
[01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:15.010]  Make sure to check out our Patreon.
[01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.310]  The patreon.com slash the regulation pod.

[01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:23.830]  Got podcasts, we got other gameplay videos, all sorts of stuff.
[01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.930]  I'm sure you'll find something you like.
[01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:29.610]  You at least I hope you did such a good job with that outro.
[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:33.270]  I did listen, but I'm not when you not when you don't
[01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:35.590]  throw the ball to me midway when I'm not expecting it.
[01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.330]  I can I can be competent every one in ten outro.
[01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:39.130]  I don't know.
[01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:42.290]  I think maybe you might be official outro man from here on out.
[01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.450]  Oh, I'm sneaking in on the outros.
[01:06:44.910 --> 01:06:48.090]  I'm going to steal outros, much like it's a base in baseball.
[01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:53.370]  But this game hasn't stolen my heart yet, but I really love it.
[01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.070]  Maybe it will.
[01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:54.530]  All right.
[01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.350]  Oh, you're rambling now.
[01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:56.470]  I am rambling.
[01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:58.530]  I was trying to figure out how to make steel work.
[01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.630]  The outro is falling apart.
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.530]  I really like this game.
[01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:01.530]  I can't wait to play with you guys.
[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:02.810]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:04.350]  Bye bye.
[01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:05.610]  See, that was terrible.
[01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.830]  That was an awful way to take back every good thing.
[01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:08.670]  Give me some compliments.
[01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:09.610]  Yeah, it's back to you.
[01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:11.150]  Yeah. Bye.
