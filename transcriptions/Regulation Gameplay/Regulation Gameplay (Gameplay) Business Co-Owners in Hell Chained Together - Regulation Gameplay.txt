[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Hey guys, we're trying out Chain Together!
[00:03.200 --> 00:03.520]  Pfft.
[00:03.920 --> 00:04.460]  That was good.
[00:04.940 --> 00:05.280]  I think it was great.
[00:05.280 --> 00:06.140]  Who did the pfft?
[00:06.180 --> 00:07.120]  I thought that was great!
[00:07.580 --> 00:07.840]  What?
[00:07.880 --> 00:08.240]  Hey, thanks guys.
[00:08.240 --> 00:08.900]  Nick, don't listen to him.
[00:09.400 --> 00:10.020]  Who did laugh?
[00:10.100 --> 00:12.280]  I thought you did a great job, man.
[00:12.320 --> 00:13.480]  Nick, that was awesome.
[00:13.780 --> 00:14.000]  Hey.
[00:14.020 --> 00:15.500]  Don't listen to the haters, Nick.
[00:15.620 --> 00:16.140]  I won't.
[00:16.380 --> 00:16.920]  Let's do it.
[00:17.000 --> 00:18.440]  So all four of us are in here.
[00:18.600 --> 00:18.880]  Alright.
[00:18.960 --> 00:21.220]  I'm gonna jam on that play button and we're gonna get after it.
[00:21.240 --> 00:21.760]  Ooh, chain smitten.
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.560]  Okay, let's...
[00:23.560 --> 00:23.900]  A little jump.
[00:23.900 --> 00:24.520]  There we go.
[00:24.560 --> 00:25.100]  There is jump.
[00:25.780 --> 00:26.260]  Oh, we gotta go.
[00:26.400 --> 00:26.480]  Hang on.
[00:26.880 --> 00:27.020]  Wait.
[00:27.020 --> 00:27.720]  Grab and chain?
[00:27.980 --> 00:30.360]  X is grab or pull.
[00:30.560 --> 00:31.000]  There we go.
[00:32.420 --> 00:32.920]  How do I sprint?
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.020]  Oh, hey, look at me.
[00:34.660 --> 00:35.160]  Is there a sprint?
[00:35.780 --> 00:36.180]  Geoff!
[00:37.120 --> 00:37.680]  That's me, I'm Geoff.
[00:37.700 --> 00:38.840]  Oh, this is already a nightmare.
[00:39.180 --> 00:41.720]  I am so glad I'm not playing this already.
[00:42.500 --> 00:44.520]  Alright, so this is Chained Together.
[00:44.800 --> 00:45.480]  Come on!
[00:45.660 --> 00:46.380]  Jesus Christ, Gavin.
[00:46.380 --> 00:48.260]  This is Chained Together, a game...
[00:48.260 --> 00:48.780]  Let's go!
[00:48.780 --> 00:51.880]  It's a game where we're in hell...
[00:51.880 --> 00:52.540]  Oh, wait, hold on.
[00:52.560 --> 00:53.660]  ...and we're trying to make it out.
[00:53.720 --> 00:53.980]  Here we go.
[00:53.980 --> 00:54.720]  It says it right here.
[00:54.780 --> 00:55.260]  This game?
[00:55.260 --> 00:55.640]  Chained...
[00:55.640 --> 00:56.900]  Chained in this hell...
[00:56.900 --> 00:57.000]  What?
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.620]  An escape is offered.
[00:58.760 --> 00:59.100]  What?
[00:59.660 --> 01:00.380]  What are you doing?
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.080]  Come on.
[01:01.120 --> 01:02.860]  I'm reading the sign to tell us what to do.
[01:02.880 --> 01:03.740]  Who gives a fuck?
[01:04.120 --> 01:04.480]  Alright, guys.
[01:04.580 --> 01:05.480]  Now I know.
[01:05.640 --> 01:06.440]  We need to reach the summit.
[01:06.460 --> 01:07.480]  Is this Hades 2?
[01:08.240 --> 01:08.920]  Gavin, did you...
[01:08.920 --> 01:09.100]  Yeah.
[01:09.700 --> 01:09.820]  Ooh.
[01:11.700 --> 01:15.200]  So we got an open chain, which means we're not all chained in a loop.
[01:15.320 --> 01:16.120]  We're chained in a line.
[01:16.140 --> 01:20.560]  Me and Nick are the furthest apart from each other, which is probably safe for both of us.
[01:20.620 --> 01:22.200]  Safe for all of us.
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.240]  I have seen people play this on TikTok.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.660]  Now I know what the fuck it is.
[01:26.660 --> 01:29.000]  Gavin, what the hell are you doing?
[01:30.220 --> 01:30.780]  How do you pull?
[01:30.980 --> 01:32.440]  Stop practicing your pulling.
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33.700 --> 01:34.000]  Okay.
[01:34.100 --> 01:34.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:35.120 --> 01:35.500]  First lift.
[01:36.060 --> 01:36.460]  Ooh.
[01:36.580 --> 01:38.080]  We're almost there to the first level.
[01:38.260 --> 01:38.920]  Alright, come on in.
[01:39.040 --> 01:41.200]  If three of you are on and I'm off, you'll probably go up.
[01:41.520 --> 01:41.980]  Yeah, we will.
[01:42.560 --> 01:43.360]  What do you mean, probably?
[01:43.580 --> 01:43.760]  Pull!
[01:44.260 --> 01:44.840]  Pull him!
[01:45.120 --> 01:45.760]  Pull him!
[01:46.260 --> 01:46.660]  Pull!
[01:47.920 --> 01:48.660]  Pull him!
[01:48.680 --> 01:48.760]  Jump!
[01:48.760 --> 01:50.080]  I can't pull the chain from here.
[01:50.780 --> 01:52.760]  That's only one person pulling currently.
[01:52.860 --> 01:53.440]  I'm flying.
[01:53.620 --> 01:54.240]  Oh, there we go.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.440]  Oh, Geoff just went off.
[01:56.880 --> 01:57.720]  Oh, Geoff's on.
[01:58.500 --> 01:59.740]  Alright, we did it.
[01:59.820 --> 02:00.700]  That was amazing.
[02:01.240 --> 02:01.480]  Okay.
[02:02.580 --> 02:05.840]  So, I wish the chain got tangled on objects, but it doesn't.
[02:06.100 --> 02:07.360]  So, if you jump...
[02:07.360 --> 02:08.200]  Oh, my God.
[02:08.440 --> 02:09.600]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:10.540 --> 02:13.820]  We need to be smart about this and not just...
[02:13.820 --> 02:14.660]  Oh, my God, guys.
[02:14.780 --> 02:15.560]  Come on!
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.660]  I think I'll guess no brakes is the way to go.
[02:18.040 --> 02:19.280]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[02:19.280 --> 02:20.900]  Don't stop to think about it.
[02:20.940 --> 02:22.020]  We just gotta go.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.200]  That's not how this works.
[02:24.200 --> 02:26.240]  Time creates fear.
[02:26.440 --> 02:26.840]  Go!
[02:27.120 --> 02:27.820]  We're all doing it.
[02:27.980 --> 02:28.460]  We're in a line.
[02:28.700 --> 02:29.520]  We're all nailing it.
[02:33.680 --> 02:34.800]  Can I start?
[02:35.420 --> 02:37.520]  Yes, and then you start again.
[02:37.800 --> 02:39.340]  We're in a line.
[02:39.740 --> 02:41.360]  We need to go in a line.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.460]  Oh, you guys are done.
[02:43.240 --> 02:45.900]  Okay, the all-gas approach was interesting, but I don't think it's a winner.
[02:46.640 --> 02:47.320]  I think it could have worked.
[02:47.600 --> 02:50.380]  I think it could have been if everybody was on the gas.
[02:51.760 --> 02:52.960]  Who wasn't gassed, do you think?
[02:53.280 --> 02:54.180]  I was in the air.
[02:55.080 --> 02:56.560]  Yes, but here's the thing.
[02:56.700 --> 02:57.400]  You were in the lead.
[02:57.500 --> 02:58.840]  You were in the middle of the chain.
[02:59.240 --> 03:01.460]  It doesn't make sense for you to be in the lead.
[03:01.540 --> 03:02.540]  Yeah, I'm the anchor point.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.280]  I'm pulling all the prawns with me.
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.780]  You think the anchor point is the thing that's in the front?
[03:08.960 --> 03:09.720]  It worked until it didn't.
[03:11.500 --> 03:12.220]  Where's the demon?
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.580]  Okay, there you go.
[03:17.740 --> 03:18.220]  Now we go.
[03:18.320 --> 03:18.720]  Look at this.
[03:18.980 --> 03:20.060]  Nick is leading the way.
[03:20.200 --> 03:20.980]  Then Geoff goes.
[03:21.260 --> 03:23.800]  Because we're in a line and it's not complicated.
[03:24.860 --> 03:25.520]  There we go.
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.560]  There we go.
[03:28.580 --> 03:29.460]  He almost ran out of chain.
[03:31.020 --> 03:32.620]  Gavin jumped his place in that line.
[03:32.680 --> 03:33.340]  Gavin, me and you.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.100]  Gavin, me and you.
[03:34.180 --> 03:34.640]  We got this.
[03:34.720 --> 03:36.000]  This is good.
[03:36.360 --> 03:36.980]  Look at this.
[03:37.500 --> 03:38.220]  What a team.
[03:38.500 --> 03:39.040]  What a team.
[03:39.260 --> 03:40.360]  Wow, oh yes.
[03:40.820 --> 03:41.660]  Baby mode shit.
[03:41.820 --> 03:43.100]  Okay, now we have to go up this.
[03:43.500 --> 03:45.940]  Get in the line, me, Gavin, Geoff, then Nick.
[03:46.460 --> 03:47.240]  Okay, I'll follow up.
[03:49.540 --> 03:51.060]  Oh, you're having a laugh with this.
[03:51.660 --> 03:52.700]  What are you doing, Eric?
[03:53.460 --> 03:54.760]  I'm trying to climb it.
[03:54.760 --> 03:55.480]  Just run.
[03:56.580 --> 03:57.660]  I'm not running.
[03:57.740 --> 03:58.160]  I'm moving.
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.560]  I'm making sure everyone's on the link.
[03:59.640 --> 04:00.520]  We're getting going.
[04:00.900 --> 04:01.760]  Nice and easy.
[04:02.020 --> 04:02.500]  Look at this.
[04:02.680 --> 04:03.440]  Slow and steady, baby.
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.640]  Having a good time.
[04:05.780 --> 04:06.520]  Who's behind me?
[04:06.580 --> 04:07.680]  Slow and steady.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.340]  Is that every NFL official has to complete this before they can hold the first down marker.
[04:12.820 --> 04:13.660]  Part of the ritual.
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.740]  How are we looking back there?
[04:17.920 --> 04:19.020]  How's everyone doing back there?
[04:19.160 --> 04:19.680]  I'm walking.
[04:19.860 --> 04:20.540]  I'm doing good.
[04:20.780 --> 04:22.320]  I just don't want to ever do this again.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.800]  Oh, you're going to end up doing it again.
[04:25.580 --> 04:26.780]  We're very high up.
[04:27.380 --> 04:28.940]  Does anybody else have issues with heights?
[04:30.500 --> 04:30.800]  No.
[04:32.440 --> 04:33.500]  Everyone keep coming.
[04:33.840 --> 04:34.640]  There we go.
[04:34.680 --> 04:35.700]  You're not a chain guy, Gavin.
[04:36.140 --> 04:37.060]  Gavin, keep coming.
[04:38.820 --> 04:40.640]  Nick, you want to lead this one?
[04:41.020 --> 04:41.340]  Yeah.
[04:41.760 --> 04:42.460]  I like that.
[04:42.660 --> 04:42.840]  Okay.
[04:43.340 --> 04:43.820]  Well, Geoff.
[04:44.040 --> 04:44.920]  Come on, Nick, lead it.
[04:45.640 --> 04:46.860]  Geoff's for some reason in the front.
[04:47.340 --> 04:47.740]  Okay.
[04:49.180 --> 04:50.200]  Geoff, now you go.
[04:51.060 --> 04:51.600]  Okay.
[04:51.600 --> 04:52.740]  I'm anchoring.
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.260]  Alright.
[04:54.720 --> 04:55.400]  We'll go up and around.
[04:56.740 --> 04:57.500]  Oh, God.
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.500]  Up and around.
[04:59.720 --> 05:00.720]  This is going pretty well, Nick.
[05:00.800 --> 05:01.500]  You're being crazy.
[05:01.900 --> 05:03.120]  This is baby work.
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.600]  This is so easy.
[05:05.040 --> 05:06.680]  Even with Nick jumping his place.
[05:07.420 --> 05:07.640]  Alright.
[05:07.740 --> 05:08.940]  We got death beams.
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.440]  What was that?
[05:10.740 --> 05:11.360]  What was that?
[05:11.520 --> 05:12.480]  Oh, my God.
[05:12.600 --> 05:13.400]  Gavin, pull him.
[05:14.770 --> 05:16.040]  What the fuck?
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.260]  You gotta pull him.
[05:17.560 --> 05:18.180]  Pull me up.
[05:18.460 --> 05:18.820]  Gavin, pull him.
[05:20.300 --> 05:21.980]  I'm tangled through the stuff.
[05:22.520 --> 05:23.540]  Geoff, pull him up.
[05:23.760 --> 05:24.600]  I'm pulling.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.300]  Grab on, Nick.
[05:32.160 --> 05:32.460]  Alright.
[05:32.580 --> 05:33.040]  There you go.
[05:33.100 --> 05:33.580]  There we go.
[05:33.660 --> 05:34.420]  Okay, okay, okay.
[05:35.780 --> 05:37.620]  Now, don't touch the wire.
[05:37.940 --> 05:38.120]  Got it.
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.440]  Is it just easy like that to jump?
[05:39.700 --> 05:40.100]  Hold on.
[05:40.360 --> 05:40.520]  Yep.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  Let's wait till everybody gets up.
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.660]  You get tons of height.
[05:43.780 --> 05:44.100]  You're all good.
[05:44.140 --> 05:44.540]  Next up.
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.040]  Easy.
[05:45.800 --> 05:46.240]  Last one.
[05:47.860 --> 05:48.760]  Okay, okay, okay.
[05:48.760 --> 05:50.220]  Just go through like this.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.340]  That's gonna...
[05:51.340 --> 05:52.120]  Oh, my God.
[05:52.340 --> 05:52.640]  Oh, God.
[05:52.740 --> 05:54.940]  You guys are so lucky it doesn't impact the chain.
[05:55.300 --> 05:56.000]  Oh, we've got a wall.
[05:56.000 --> 05:56.360]  Hang on.
[05:56.740 --> 05:58.280]  We've got like a Super Mario wall.
[05:58.320 --> 05:59.340]  Oh, we have to do it like Mario.
[05:59.340 --> 06:00.240]  Yeah, Mario shit.
[06:00.900 --> 06:02.240]  So, do we have to hold on?
[06:02.460 --> 06:02.720]  Okay.
[06:03.760 --> 06:04.400]  What's the button?
[06:04.440 --> 06:04.600]  Press X.
[06:04.600 --> 06:05.280]  Do you just run into it?
[06:05.400 --> 06:05.780]  Press X.
[06:05.820 --> 06:05.940]  Yeah.
[06:06.000 --> 06:06.920]  How do I punch a Koopa?
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.740]  Where's the gate that spins me onto the back?
[06:12.520 --> 06:13.460]  Y'all are insane.
[06:13.660 --> 06:14.320]  This is great.
[06:14.880 --> 06:15.680]  What if I press spacebar?
[06:15.680 --> 06:16.080]  Feeling good.
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.300]  This is what it is.
[06:17.500 --> 06:18.740]  This is regulation right here.
[06:19.640 --> 06:21.540]  We're a regulation team, baby.
[06:22.720 --> 06:23.660]  Oh, my God.
[06:23.740 --> 06:24.580]  What is happening?
[06:28.800 --> 06:29.520]  Hang on.
[06:29.680 --> 06:30.240]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:30.560 --> 06:31.240]  What does that do?
[06:31.500 --> 06:32.340]  Hang on.
[06:33.240 --> 06:35.720]  I think we all should get on it together at the same time.
[06:36.540 --> 06:37.620]  One, two, three.
[06:37.980 --> 06:39.540]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[06:39.540 --> 06:40.300]  Oh, you chained it.
[06:41.740 --> 06:43.380]  Just go, just go, just go, just go.
[06:43.760 --> 06:44.100]  Just go.
[06:44.380 --> 06:44.960]  Yes, yes, yes.
[06:45.320 --> 06:46.040]  Okay, we did it.
[06:47.580 --> 06:48.620]  That was safe.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.400]  We're in the safety cave.
[06:50.480 --> 06:51.180]  We're in the safety cave.
[06:51.620 --> 06:53.340]  Oh, boys.
[06:53.740 --> 06:55.160]  Boys, I don't know about this.
[06:56.620 --> 06:57.260]  Oh, here we go.
[06:59.540 --> 07:00.560]  Okay, there we go.
[07:00.900 --> 07:03.180]  Easy, easy, a ladder, simple.
[07:03.380 --> 07:05.480]  Which way are we going?
[07:05.660 --> 07:06.260]  Oh, no.
[07:06.660 --> 07:07.260]  Wait, what?
[07:07.260 --> 07:07.920]  We got a tightrope.
[07:08.380 --> 07:09.520]  Oh, no.
[07:10.560 --> 07:11.140]  No, no, no.
[07:11.160 --> 07:11.640]  All right, then.
[07:11.820 --> 07:14.080]  We went from level two to level eight in difficulty.
[07:15.760 --> 07:16.720]  So, okay.
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.200]  Oh, my God.
[07:18.620 --> 07:19.700]  You're shitting me with this.
[07:19.700 --> 07:22.580]  You are fucking kidding me.
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.640]  How are the heights going, Geoff?
[07:26.160 --> 07:28.040]  Andrew, how are you feeling about not playing?
[07:28.140 --> 07:29.220]  Oh, so happy.
[07:29.680 --> 07:30.640]  I'm so relieved.
[07:32.380 --> 07:34.940]  I would feel so stressed right now if I were you guys.
[07:35.060 --> 07:35.980]  Oh, yeah, it's great.
[07:36.360 --> 07:40.520]  My butthole is so fucking tight right now, I'm going to throw up.
[07:41.340 --> 07:43.220]  It's not even the UFO.
[07:43.220 --> 07:44.580]  It's the impact.
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.600]  My butthole is so tight, it's sticking out somehow.
[07:48.940 --> 07:52.300]  It's like I've stress prolapsed.
[07:53.080 --> 07:55.420]  Respectfully, Geoff, I don't think you have a regulation butthole.
[07:55.880 --> 07:58.340]  I think you're trying to make the most of it.
[07:59.160 --> 07:59.760]  That's fair.
[08:04.680 --> 08:05.400]  Oh, no.
[08:06.660 --> 08:07.680]  Nick, you got to relax.
[08:07.900 --> 08:08.740]  No, this is the wrong way.
[08:09.180 --> 08:10.500]  This might be the wrong way.
[08:10.760 --> 08:11.680]  Eric, go the other way.
[08:11.960 --> 08:12.320]  Back and left.
[08:12.320 --> 08:14.000]  Oh, you had to turn around.
[08:14.200 --> 08:15.380]  Should we see if I can jump to that?
[08:15.860 --> 08:16.060]  No.
[08:17.320 --> 08:17.720]  Alright.
[08:18.720 --> 08:20.160]  Nick is insane.
[08:20.640 --> 08:21.520]  You're saying go this way.
[08:21.680 --> 08:22.580]  You have to learn.
[08:24.060 --> 08:27.060]  Yeah, learning not to jump is the first lesson.
[08:28.060 --> 08:29.600]  But if you guys could pull me back.
[08:29.900 --> 08:31.040]  Oh, there's no way.
[08:31.040 --> 08:31.760]  Moving up just enough.
[08:32.040 --> 08:32.840]  This is fine.
[08:33.120 --> 08:33.840]  This is fine.
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.100]  This is so fine.
[08:36.880 --> 08:38.200]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[08:39.040 --> 08:41.300]  If I go up here, that is the way, right?
[08:41.300 --> 08:42.760]  If I go up here, yeah.
[08:43.320 --> 08:45.120]  Just making sure.
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.660]  You know how companies have team building exercises?
[08:49.060 --> 08:51.820]  Do you think this could be used for some of those?
[08:52.740 --> 08:54.300]  This is like a ropes course.
[08:54.440 --> 08:54.980]  You kill someone.
[08:55.020 --> 08:56.500]  This is like the demonic ropes course.
[08:56.780 --> 08:57.900]  What am I doing?
[08:58.420 --> 08:58.820]  I can't climb.
[08:59.060 --> 09:00.220]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin!
[09:00.920 --> 09:02.320]  What are you doing?
[09:02.360 --> 09:03.060]  You can climb.
[09:04.040 --> 09:05.440]  What are you doing?
[09:05.600 --> 09:07.400]  This is modeled after Donda Academy, right?
[09:08.420 --> 09:09.600]  Careful, careful, careful.
[09:09.600 --> 09:10.300]  Where the hell are we going?
[09:10.300 --> 09:11.080]  That's rounded, it's tough.
[09:11.080 --> 09:13.200]  Okay, I see it.
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.660]  That guy was leading us.
[09:15.800 --> 09:16.320]  Thank you, Andrew.
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.110]  To be fair, they're all skulls.
[09:22.220 --> 09:22.560]  Oh no!
[09:22.920 --> 09:28.600]  Oh my god, oh my god, I fell and got caught myself.
[09:29.060 --> 09:31.940]  I'm glad we're recording with lag because I didn't see anything that happened with you.
[09:32.300 --> 09:32.840]  Nope, me neither.
[09:33.900 --> 09:36.840]  Don't get on that, don't get on that, wait until we're all up.
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.280]  Okay, okay, here I go.
[09:39.700 --> 09:41.000]  I'm sweating so bad!
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.180]  I'm going completely sideways!
[09:43.640 --> 09:44.660]  Who the hell did that?
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.500]  Too late to tell.
[09:47.380 --> 09:49.380]  Wait, wait, wait, we're gonna go to the next one!
[09:49.560 --> 09:49.840]  Wait!
[09:53.280 --> 09:54.160]  Ready, go!
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.860]  Why did you say one when you weren't committed?
[09:57.000 --> 09:57.140]  Go!
[09:59.460 --> 10:01.620]  Oh my fucking god.
[10:01.680 --> 10:02.640]  Whose fault was that?
[10:03.420 --> 10:03.860]  Eric's.
[10:03.920 --> 10:04.220]  Gavin.
[10:04.600 --> 10:05.460]  You said one.
[10:05.900 --> 10:07.900]  Gavin just decided to go.
[10:08.060 --> 10:08.780]  He went on one.
[10:09.000 --> 10:09.540]  What's the number for go?
[10:10.320 --> 10:11.280]  That is not...
[10:12.640 --> 10:14.160]  This is insane.
[10:15.720 --> 10:17.640]  Ah, shit, guys, it looks like it's gonna rain.
[10:20.340 --> 10:21.740]  Gonna make everything slippery.
[10:22.520 --> 10:23.520]  Okay, okay, we're good, we're good.
[10:23.560 --> 10:23.940]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10:24.140 --> 10:25.400]  Hang on, hang on.
[10:25.520 --> 10:26.220]  There's a gap here.
[10:26.860 --> 10:27.780]  We gotta make this jump.
[10:28.540 --> 10:29.120]  There we go.
[10:29.640 --> 10:32.020]  Alright, and then everybody up.
[10:33.580 --> 10:35.340]  Oh my god, what happened?
[10:36.160 --> 10:37.040]  What happened?
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.580]  Yes, I'm dead!
[10:40.640 --> 10:48.090]  Gavin, what happened?
[10:48.270 --> 10:50.030]  The ladder expelled us.
[10:50.730 --> 10:54.710]  So, I tried to sprint to climb the ladder...
[10:55.790 --> 10:56.920]  and it threw me.
[10:58.090 --> 10:58.750]  You...
[10:58.750 --> 10:59.370]  Fuck!
[10:59.570 --> 11:00.530]  Is there no checkpoint?
[11:01.810 --> 11:02.470]  Gavin.
[11:04.110 --> 11:04.770]  Gavin!
[11:05.150 --> 11:06.990]  That was, look, that was a learning thing.
[11:07.450 --> 11:07.670]  How?
[11:07.670 --> 11:10.170]  Gavin, bringing us down to earth.
[11:10.390 --> 11:13.010]  I just wanted to jump to another ledge.
[11:13.170 --> 11:14.810]  We need a relegation system.
[11:15.790 --> 11:17.370]  Oh, I'm so mad.
[11:17.550 --> 11:19.210]  I'm so fucking mad.
[11:19.250 --> 11:20.890]  I have to be in the front still?
[11:21.510 --> 11:22.430]  I'm so mad.
[11:22.610 --> 11:23.150]  Hey, you know what?
[11:23.690 --> 11:24.670]  Group huddle, guys, group huddle.
[11:24.790 --> 11:25.570]  I'm really sorry about that.
[11:26.050 --> 11:27.550]  I want to apologize to each of you individually.
[11:27.690 --> 11:28.210]  Eric, I'm sorry.
[11:29.190 --> 11:30.450]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[11:30.690 --> 11:33.330]  No, apology not accepted.
[11:33.350 --> 11:35.590]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[11:36.050 --> 11:38.750]  Do you think we make it back that far?
[11:39.090 --> 11:39.710]  Oh, definitely.
[11:40.910 --> 11:42.150]  Oh no, Eric's stuck.
[11:42.570 --> 11:43.970]  Eric's stuck under the lift.
[11:44.190 --> 11:45.190]  Pull him, pull Eric.
[11:45.330 --> 11:45.930]  I don't want to go.
[11:45.950 --> 11:46.650]  No, he can't.
[11:47.470 --> 11:47.990]  I don't want to go.
[11:47.990 --> 11:49.090]  Swing this way, swing this way.
[11:49.270 --> 11:49.670]  Okay, there you go.
[11:49.670 --> 11:50.670]  Oh, he can go through, okay.
[11:51.070 --> 11:51.770]  Gavin, wait!
[11:52.130 --> 11:52.410]  Geoff!
[11:52.690 --> 11:53.030]  Whoever!
[11:54.730 --> 11:55.330]  I'll guess.
[11:55.490 --> 11:55.630]  Oh, God!
[11:55.850 --> 11:56.730]  Oh, shit!
[11:58.090 --> 11:58.750]  Leave him!
[11:59.010 --> 12:00.230]  Leave him, he deserves it!
[12:00.350 --> 12:00.510]  No, no!
[12:00.650 --> 12:01.690]  Leave him down there!
[12:01.730 --> 12:02.570]  I can't leave me!
[12:02.570 --> 12:03.510]  That's where you belong!
[12:03.790 --> 12:04.170]  Pull him up!
[12:04.170 --> 12:05.810]  That's where you belong, do you understand?
[12:06.030 --> 12:06.870]  Eric, forgive and forget.
[12:06.890 --> 12:07.310]  That's it!
[12:10.030 --> 12:12.250]  Okay, okay, okay.
[12:12.270 --> 12:20.070]  So, I wonder if, was I tossed from the ladder because the sprint key is just jump off the ladder or because I twanged the chain and it was like, it was too taut.
[12:20.330 --> 12:22.330]  Something shot out at you and knocked you off.
[12:22.330 --> 12:23.130]  Yeah, something shot out.
[12:23.130 --> 12:25.230]  So maybe, maybe it wasn't my fault at all.
[12:26.310 --> 12:27.290]  It's funnier if it is.
[12:27.290 --> 12:29.050]  I will say, that remains to be seen.
[12:29.370 --> 12:29.670]  Okay.
[12:29.870 --> 12:33.110]  It could have been a coincidence that I was about to screw us, but something screwed me.
[12:35.330 --> 12:36.330]  I've had that happen.
[12:36.390 --> 12:37.770]  I had some electrical problems.
[12:37.870 --> 12:42.770]  I plugged something in, something turned off, the electrician went, now look, you either caused that or it just happened.
[12:42.950 --> 12:44.030]  I can't be sure.
[12:44.470 --> 12:50.750]  Do you guys remember how scary we thought these chains were before the bone scaffolding?
[12:50.770 --> 12:52.090]  Oh, this is fucking, this is nothing now.
[12:52.250 --> 12:53.950]  I don't give a fuck about these chains.
[12:54.150 --> 12:54.990]  At all.
[12:55.090 --> 12:56.490]  Giant fat chains.
[12:57.010 --> 12:58.890]  I could drive a car on these chains or something.
[12:58.890 --> 12:59.670]  Yeah, you sure could.
[13:02.070 --> 13:05.850]  This is, when you come back here, this ain't shit.
[13:06.030 --> 13:06.390]  Yeah.
[13:06.450 --> 13:07.670]  This is crazy.
[13:07.850 --> 13:08.110]  Uh-oh.
[13:08.150 --> 13:09.210]  This is...
[13:09.210 --> 13:09.830]  Who won?
[13:10.350 --> 13:10.970]  Little Geoffy.
[13:11.530 --> 13:11.850]  Pull me up.
[13:11.850 --> 13:12.370]  Oh, God.
[13:12.570 --> 13:13.010]  Oh, no.
[13:13.210 --> 13:13.490]  Pull him.
[13:14.110 --> 13:14.630]  Pull Geoff.
[13:15.030 --> 13:15.470]  Pull me.
[13:15.750 --> 13:16.190]  Pull me.
[13:16.830 --> 13:17.210]  Pull him.
[13:17.450 --> 13:18.330]  Geoff, you gotta pull Nick.
[13:18.590 --> 13:18.950]  I am.
[13:19.630 --> 13:21.010]  Oh, you're killing me.
[13:21.010 --> 13:21.730]  You're pulling the other one.
[13:21.870 --> 13:23.070]  You're pulling, you're pulling Gavin.
[13:23.310 --> 13:23.630]  Pull me.
[13:23.790 --> 13:24.830]  Hold on, I'm in a bad spot.
[13:25.130 --> 13:25.430]  Hold on.
[13:25.590 --> 13:28.490]  All of this happening while you guys talk about how this ain't shit.
[13:28.490 --> 13:31.670]  Nick keeps pulling me off while I'm trying to pull him.
[13:32.390 --> 13:33.850]  Nick, stop pulling Geoff off.
[13:34.310 --> 13:35.610]  These guys are morons.
[13:38.230 --> 13:39.770]  Oh, even this ain't no shit.
[13:39.770 --> 13:40.070]  That's good, that's good.
[13:42.190 --> 13:43.170]  That was Eric.
[13:43.650 --> 13:44.630]  Oh, that was Eric's fault.
[13:44.630 --> 13:45.350]  That was not me.
[13:45.390 --> 13:45.810]  I didn't touch it.
[13:45.810 --> 13:46.590]  That was definitely Eric.
[13:47.010 --> 13:47.550]  That was Eric.
[13:47.710 --> 13:48.830]  That didn't touch it.
[13:48.970 --> 13:49.290]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:49.310 --> 13:49.790]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:49.890 --> 13:49.950]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:49.950 --> 13:51.070]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:51.070 --> 13:51.090]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:51.090 --> 13:51.970]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:52.450 --> 13:55.310]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:55.610 --> 13:56.290]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:57.730 --> 13:58.470]  I'm 100% Eric.
[13:59.170 --> 14:00.530]  I didn't touch it.
[14:01.130 --> 14:02.150]  Bitch, you touched everything.
[14:02.470 --> 14:02.630]  Go!
[14:03.210 --> 14:07.050]  All I know is that I went afterwards after everyone was gone.
[14:09.230 --> 14:10.430]  Stop abseiling off me.
[14:10.910 --> 14:13.250]  Is this an endless climber or can you be...
[14:13.250 --> 14:14.190]  No, no, people can beat this.
[14:14.270 --> 14:14.650]  There's an end.
[14:14.770 --> 14:15.530]  There's gotta be an end.
[14:16.270 --> 14:17.430]  You gotta do it all in one shot?
[14:17.990 --> 14:18.150]  Yeah.
[14:18.150 --> 14:20.990]  Yeah, but I think you get to the point where you can punch that demon in the tongue.
[14:21.570 --> 14:21.970]  Yeah, good.
[14:22.470 --> 14:23.830]  Punch his dick off.
[14:24.710 --> 14:24.930]  Uh-oh.
[14:29.420 --> 14:31.000]  This is actually a prequel to Doom.
[14:31.740 --> 14:32.820]  This is how it all started.
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.180]  We opened the door.
[14:36.000 --> 14:36.360]  Yeah.
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.080]  Is Carl Urban on the other side?
[14:41.520 --> 14:41.840]  Hello.
[14:43.260 --> 14:44.160]  Y'all are moving.
[14:44.400 --> 14:44.960]  This is great.
[14:45.120 --> 14:45.880]  Y'all are doing great.
[14:46.080 --> 14:46.820]  I'm trying.
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.900]  I just came up with the shittiest joke that was so bad I didn't even say it.
[14:50.960 --> 14:51.340]  No, say it.
[14:51.760 --> 14:52.380]  That's cool.
[14:52.540 --> 14:53.260]  You wanna hit us with it?
[14:53.260 --> 14:54.380]  So everyone can clip it out?
[14:54.580 --> 14:55.240]  Yeah, you wanna hear it?
[14:55.480 --> 14:55.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[14:56.560 --> 14:57.600]  Do you ever play Doom backwards?
[14:59.780 --> 15:00.160]  No.
[15:00.520 --> 15:00.800]  No?
[15:01.740 --> 15:02.540]  The real boot.
[15:03.340 --> 15:03.620]  Okay.
[15:04.040 --> 15:04.500]  You know what?
[15:04.580 --> 15:08.300]  Yeah, I saw the joke coming, but I was hoping it wasn't coming, but then it did come.
[15:08.300 --> 15:08.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:08.760 --> 15:09.080]  Me too.
[15:10.000 --> 15:10.560]  Absolutely, 100%.
[15:10.560 --> 15:11.700]  Yeah, that's why I didn't say it.
[15:11.860 --> 15:12.380]  No one heard it.
[15:12.500 --> 15:13.380]  But then you did say it.
[15:13.380 --> 15:13.840]  Oh, you're right.
[15:14.000 --> 15:14.660]  Well, no, but yeah.
[15:14.660 --> 15:14.840]  Oh, shit.
[15:15.600 --> 15:16.320]  Yeah, you shouldn't have done that.
[15:16.420 --> 15:17.060]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[15:17.340 --> 15:18.000]  Oh, that's Gavin's bad.
[15:18.020 --> 15:20.180]  Alright, this is where things went to shit last time.
[15:20.420 --> 15:20.920]  Going for it.
[15:22.720 --> 15:25.740]  Gavin finishes the joke in two of you just start choking him out with the chain.
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.180]  Alright, hold on.
[15:29.180 --> 15:30.520]  Alright, here we go.
[15:30.880 --> 15:31.420]  Lock it in.
[15:31.660 --> 15:31.800]  Go.
[15:33.680 --> 15:34.480]  Nice, nice.
[15:34.740 --> 15:35.500]  One more time.
[15:35.900 --> 15:36.540]  Alright, we did it.
[15:36.620 --> 15:37.080]  Look at that.
[15:37.300 --> 15:38.260]  Touch it.
[15:38.280 --> 15:39.120]  Get off the stuff.
[15:40.040 --> 15:40.820]  Nick got seven.
[15:40.820 --> 15:41.320]  Hang on, hang on.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.360]  No, next one.
[15:42.620 --> 15:43.280]  Okay, now we're good.
[15:43.280 --> 15:46.000]  Get off the stuff would be a great name for one of these games.
[15:46.240 --> 15:47.040]  Alright, I'll lead the way here.
[15:47.160 --> 15:49.080]  That's my rehab facility.
[15:52.200 --> 15:55.580]  I am sweating like fucking crazy.
[15:57.920 --> 15:59.640]  Dude, I'm pitting out right now.
[15:59.640 --> 16:00.480]  This is bad.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.200]  It's real bad.
[16:01.860 --> 16:04.320]  You've got so many more recordings today, you're going to be all stink.
[16:04.460 --> 16:05.300]  I'm going to have to take a shower.
[16:05.420 --> 16:07.640]  Yeah, there's a shower between this and the next.
[16:08.380 --> 16:09.020]  Alright, straight on.
[16:09.440 --> 16:10.440]  Hold on, wait, wait, now.
[16:11.000 --> 16:11.280]  Let's go.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.160]  And the next one.
[16:13.440 --> 16:13.760]  Yep.
[16:13.860 --> 16:14.620]  That's awesome.
[16:14.840 --> 16:16.100]  And the next one.
[16:16.320 --> 16:16.640]  Yep.
[16:17.180 --> 16:17.500]  Easy.
[16:17.800 --> 16:18.640]  Oh, we can make it on top.
[16:18.800 --> 16:19.640]  There we go.
[16:20.660 --> 16:21.300]  Good landing.
[16:23.840 --> 16:24.660]  Boys, we're up here.
[16:24.680 --> 16:24.960]  Make the jump.
[16:24.960 --> 16:25.500]  Look at that.
[16:26.560 --> 16:27.480]  What are you doing?
[16:28.100 --> 16:28.720]  No, no, it's okay.
[16:29.300 --> 16:29.780]  It's alright.
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.540]  Oh, we went a different way.
[16:31.660 --> 16:32.060]  That's cool.
[16:32.580 --> 16:32.740]  Yeah.
[16:33.240 --> 16:33.500]  Alright.
[16:34.240 --> 16:35.080]  Okay, who's leading?
[16:35.080 --> 16:36.120]  Alright, everybody dry your hands.
[16:36.980 --> 16:37.820]  Go ahead, Eric.
[16:37.920 --> 16:38.460]  You have better luck.
[16:38.620 --> 16:39.320]  I'm going first?
[16:39.460 --> 16:40.800]  Alright, so it's me, Gavin, Geoff.
[16:40.880 --> 16:41.240]  Right, Nick.
[16:41.360 --> 16:41.700]  Let's go.
[16:43.980 --> 16:45.280]  Hang on, am I going left or right?
[16:45.280 --> 16:46.020]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[16:46.020 --> 16:46.540]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:46.580 --> 16:47.080]  Stop, stop, stop.
[16:47.140 --> 16:47.640]  Stop, stop, stop.
[16:48.300 --> 16:49.980]  You couldn't have looked before you leaped?
[16:50.680 --> 16:51.000]  No.
[16:51.620 --> 16:52.540]  The penitent man.
[16:52.760 --> 16:53.900]  You go left and then right?
[16:54.260 --> 16:57.280]  If I go this way, I think this will make a skip.
[16:57.500 --> 16:58.200]  I think we'll get there.
[16:58.400 --> 16:59.340]  Why would you go that way?
[16:59.700 --> 17:01.140]  Why is Gavin behind Geoff?
[17:01.180 --> 17:02.060]  Which way do you want me to go?
[17:02.140 --> 17:02.500]  Go left.
[17:02.580 --> 17:03.120]  You want me to go the other way?
[17:03.240 --> 17:03.600]  Alright, guys.
[17:03.700 --> 17:05.180]  Alright, guys, Gavin said go this way.
[17:05.320 --> 17:05.460]  Go right, go right.
[17:05.480 --> 17:05.960]  Let's do it.
[17:06.300 --> 17:06.720]  And then up.
[17:06.740 --> 17:07.160]  Go right.
[17:08.180 --> 17:09.400]  I think you both can work here.
[17:09.400 --> 17:10.520]  You're pulling me off, you fool!
[17:10.760 --> 17:11.340]  You're an idiot!
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.240]  Oh, okay, we've created...
[17:15.140 --> 17:16.940]  I'm going to kill...
[17:16.940 --> 17:19.200]  I mean, we were going right, everything was locked in.
[17:19.320 --> 17:20.340]  Gavin's second guess is it.
[17:20.380 --> 17:21.180]  Here we are at the bottom.
[17:21.420 --> 17:21.660]  Gavin!
[17:21.780 --> 17:22.040]  What do you mean?
[17:22.040 --> 17:23.000]  I didn't do anything.
[17:23.080 --> 17:24.240]  I got pulled off the damn thing.
[17:24.300 --> 17:27.060]  I was just waiting for the people at the end to decide which way.
[17:28.220 --> 17:32.920]  Oh, it was decided, and then second in the chain decided to...
[17:32.920 --> 17:34.160]  Oh, why are we going that way?
[17:34.380 --> 17:35.320]  Because last time we went left.
[17:35.320 --> 17:36.520]  Okay, let's go the way Gavin wants to go.
[17:36.540 --> 17:37.900]  Let's go the way the middle man wants to go.
[17:37.900 --> 17:39.080]  Last time we died!
[17:39.540 --> 17:41.600]  Left got us to the end of that part, though.
[17:42.220 --> 17:43.100]  Yeah, I was going to just...
[17:43.100 --> 17:44.280]  There's clearly...
[17:44.280 --> 17:48.460]  Yeah, and we had to stop which way we were going.
[17:48.740 --> 17:50.700]  I think if we went right, it's a shorter route.
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.640]  Alright, let's go right.
[17:51.640 --> 17:53.140]  Right might have been the easier way.
[17:53.200 --> 17:53.960]  Oh, I hope it's not.
[17:55.060 --> 17:55.960]  I'm going to...
[17:56.820 --> 17:57.980]  We lost Eric again.
[17:59.800 --> 18:00.680]  I don't want to.
[18:00.880 --> 18:02.660]  I don't think Eric's built for this kind of game.
[18:02.920 --> 18:03.140]  No.
[18:03.940 --> 18:04.780]  Not at all.
[18:04.880 --> 18:05.200]  Eric's...
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.600]  Nothing about this is...
[18:06.600 --> 18:07.340]  I don't know.
[18:07.700 --> 18:10.060]  As opposed to Gavin, who was created in a lab.
[18:11.700 --> 18:13.580]  Oh my god, we're going crazy.
[18:14.500 --> 18:14.940]  I got you.
[18:15.020 --> 18:17.300]  It's the second jump, guys. Come on.
[18:17.320 --> 18:20.560]  Hey, Eric's definitely the guy who brought the kickball and then went home when his team didn't win.
[18:20.560 --> 18:25.820]  Oh, I would absolutely never take it home if I didn't win.
[18:26.220 --> 18:31.060]  I would absolutely judge the rest of my team for losing it for me.
[18:31.920 --> 18:33.060]  Yeah, that sounds like you.
[18:36.220 --> 18:37.460]  Someone's got to be in the front.
[18:37.560 --> 18:37.860]  Yeah, you!
[18:37.860 --> 18:39.100]  It's not an easy job, Nick.
[18:39.380 --> 18:39.580]  What?
[18:40.040 --> 18:40.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[18:41.320 --> 18:43.280]  Don't question the leadership.
[18:44.140 --> 18:48.940]  I just watched you run to the front and assumed that it was less stupid for me to hang back.
[18:48.940 --> 18:54.000]  I have asked if you want to go first, I don't know how many times in this video.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.540]  Oh, I got my ball!
[18:55.700 --> 18:56.720]  Oh, my ball!
[18:57.480 --> 19:00.940]  Man, when Eric and Nick are going at each other, you know something's gone wrong.
[19:01.260 --> 19:03.840]  Do you think they fight like this on the other podcast they do?
[19:04.100 --> 19:04.660]  The food one?
[19:04.940 --> 19:06.160]  No, not really.
[19:07.760 --> 19:09.220]  There's less to fight about.
[19:09.540 --> 19:09.900]  There's judgment.
[19:11.420 --> 19:12.600]  Oh, there's definitely judgment.
[19:12.920 --> 19:13.400]  Oh, I fell!
[19:13.620 --> 19:14.120]  Oh god, oh god.
[19:14.340 --> 19:14.620]  Oh shit.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.020]  Alright, one, two, three, go.
[19:16.280 --> 19:16.580]  Go.
[19:17.900 --> 19:18.280]  Go.
[19:19.500 --> 19:19.900]  Nice!
[19:20.780 --> 19:21.900]  Good job, good job, good job.
[19:21.960 --> 19:22.840]  Stay off the shit.
[19:23.220 --> 19:23.860]  Stay off the shit.
[19:24.320 --> 19:25.740]  That's why Eric rehabbed the place.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.280]  Nah, we're good, we're good.
[19:27.480 --> 19:29.380]  Once you get off the shit, you gotta stay off it.
[19:29.940 --> 19:30.220]  That's our maintenance plan.
[19:30.220 --> 19:31.380]  It's a prequel to The Floor Sucks.
[19:36.400 --> 19:37.840]  Thanks for watching this video.
[19:38.060 --> 19:39.880]  If you really like this part, sit tight.
[19:39.980 --> 19:41.780]  We'll probably be seeing it again here in just a minute.
[19:44.460 --> 19:47.640]  Watch us get really good at this specific part over and over.
[19:47.640 --> 19:48.220]  All together.
[19:48.400 --> 19:48.920]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[19:49.300 --> 19:49.720]  And go.
[19:50.040 --> 19:50.120]  Alright, stop.
[19:50.460 --> 19:50.580]  Go.
[19:52.260 --> 19:52.980]  Alright, here we go.
[19:53.080 --> 19:53.600]  One, one.
[19:53.880 --> 19:54.160]  Go!
[19:54.560 --> 19:55.940]  And here we...
[19:56.540 --> 19:56.820]  Go!
[19:57.700 --> 19:59.300]  Let's take it all the way to the top again.
[19:59.360 --> 19:59.600]  Yes!
[20:00.260 --> 20:00.800]  Oh, shortcut.
[20:05.100 --> 20:05.720]  Okay, let's go.
[20:07.340 --> 20:07.620]  Nice.
[20:07.820 --> 20:08.660]  Oh, the chain didn't get it.
[20:08.740 --> 20:09.440]  Okay, so.
[20:09.700 --> 20:09.920]  So.
[20:10.600 --> 20:13.600]  I'm looking, because if we go to the right, I think it's going to be shorter, but if you
[20:13.600 --> 20:15.480]  guys want to go to the left, we can absolutely do that.
[20:15.540 --> 20:16.000]  No, go right.
[20:16.720 --> 20:17.460]  You gotta live a little.
[20:17.860 --> 20:18.540]  Lead the way, Captain.
[20:18.540 --> 20:18.920]  Okay.
[20:19.680 --> 20:20.480]  Gotta break an egg.
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.460]  Maybe we'll find like a...
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.500]  Gavin, Gavin needs to be second, Geoff.
[20:23.560 --> 20:24.260]  The alien...
[20:24.260 --> 20:24.720]  Geoff, Gavin needs to be second.
[20:24.720 --> 20:25.340]  I'm going to let him be second.
[20:25.500 --> 20:26.860]  Maybe we'll find like the alien blasters.
[20:27.960 --> 20:28.380]  Bull Easter.
[20:32.120 --> 20:32.560]  Oh, boy.
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.860]  If you want Eric to play this game more, make sure to sign up on our Patreon and just keep
[20:36.860 --> 20:38.280]  voting for us to play this game.
[20:39.200 --> 20:39.400]  No.
[20:39.400 --> 20:39.440]  No.
[20:40.200 --> 20:40.600]  Climb.
[20:41.140 --> 20:41.540]  Climb.
[20:42.080 --> 20:42.460]  There we go.
[20:42.780 --> 20:43.040]  No!
[20:43.280 --> 20:43.600]  Climb!
[20:45.440 --> 20:46.520]  What's going on?
[20:46.640 --> 20:48.040]  Gavin, can you climb?
[20:48.260 --> 20:48.540]  Climb!
[20:48.540 --> 20:48.920]  Climb!
[20:49.380 --> 20:49.460]  Climb!
[20:49.880 --> 20:51.200]  That's a bit of an ugly climb, that.
[20:51.640 --> 20:53.140]  Yeah, that's a rough one.
[20:53.880 --> 20:54.180]  Oh, God.
[20:54.460 --> 20:54.720]  Oh, God.
[20:56.160 --> 20:56.920]  Geoff, stay right.
[20:57.060 --> 20:57.680]  Oh, I can't.
[20:57.760 --> 20:58.360]  Oh, my God.
[20:58.800 --> 20:59.160]  Pull me up.
[20:59.260 --> 20:59.700]  Pull me up.
[20:59.800 --> 21:00.240]  Pull me up.
[21:00.260 --> 21:00.700]  Pull me up.
[21:00.940 --> 21:01.440]  Pull me up.
[21:01.960 --> 21:02.600]  I can't.
[21:02.680 --> 21:02.860]  Wait.
[21:03.020 --> 21:03.280]  Hang on.
[21:03.500 --> 21:03.860]  Hang on.
[21:04.680 --> 21:05.200]  Hang on.
[21:06.060 --> 21:06.380]  Yes.
[21:06.580 --> 21:06.860]  No.
[21:07.040 --> 21:08.480]  I need to get closer to the...
[21:08.480 --> 21:08.860]  Grab it.
[21:08.940 --> 21:09.160]  I'm on.
[21:09.480 --> 21:09.800]  No!
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.080]  No, Eric went down.
[21:11.200 --> 21:11.660]  Geoff's up.
[21:11.940 --> 21:13.600]  Come on.
[21:15.140 --> 21:15.580]  Pull.
[21:16.120 --> 21:17.080]  Pull him, Geoff.
[21:17.240 --> 21:17.700]  Pull him.
[21:17.780 --> 21:18.100]  Oh, no.
[21:18.260 --> 21:18.540]  I'm up.
[21:18.580 --> 21:19.020]  No!
[21:19.640 --> 21:20.940]  I'll kill you.
[21:21.300 --> 21:21.720]  No!
[21:22.740 --> 21:23.620]  What happened?
[21:24.800 --> 21:26.020]  You fucking idiot.
[21:27.500 --> 21:28.080]  All right.
[21:28.560 --> 21:30.320]  Maybe right wasn't the way to go.
[21:31.060 --> 21:32.020]  Okay, let's go.
[21:32.140 --> 21:32.380]  All right.
[21:32.460 --> 21:33.100]  Hey, you know what?
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.280]  Let's go left, baby.
[21:34.500 --> 21:37.500]  Yeah, because if you remember, left is the way we went when we did it.
[21:38.220 --> 21:38.660]  Yeah.
[21:38.660 --> 21:42.020]  Yeah, but we ended up having to backtrack, go a different way.
[21:42.540 --> 21:45.660]  That's what I'm trying to avoid because going right seemed like it was shorter.
[21:46.460 --> 21:48.120]  I still stand by right, but we'll go left.
[21:48.400 --> 21:49.460]  You want to do right again?
[21:49.740 --> 21:51.200]  No, I don't want to.
[21:51.380 --> 21:51.400]  Let's go left.
[21:51.460 --> 21:53.040]  I think that jump's a little tricky.
[21:54.600 --> 21:56.900]  I held that chain for so long.
[21:57.240 --> 21:57.920]  You did, Nick.
[21:57.960 --> 21:59.460]  You did such a good job at that shit.
[21:59.560 --> 22:00.260]  You did a great job, Nick.
[22:00.740 --> 22:01.260]  Can I pull...
[22:01.260 --> 22:01.480]  Oops.
[22:01.940 --> 22:05.220]  Can I pull myself when I'm hanging to pull myself up?
[22:05.260 --> 22:05.560]  Maybe.
[22:05.560 --> 22:05.960]  I don't know.
[22:06.240 --> 22:08.020]  I think it pulls Geoff down.
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.580]  It pulls Geoff down.
[22:10.620 --> 22:11.880]  Nick, pull us up!
[22:11.900 --> 22:12.640]  What are you doing?
[22:18.410 --> 22:21.370]  After 20 minutes, we're hanging off the lift at the beginning.
[22:22.750 --> 22:23.110]  No!
[22:23.650 --> 22:23.950]  No!
[22:25.030 --> 22:25.790]  Now we're not.
[22:26.190 --> 22:26.550]  Alright.
[22:27.870 --> 22:31.450]  You guys have gotten progressively worse with each run.
[22:31.970 --> 22:33.890]  That first run was a banger, though, wasn't it?
[22:34.170 --> 22:36.490]  What are you doing, you silly bastard?
[22:38.710 --> 22:39.230]  Nick!
[22:39.230 --> 22:40.330]  Pull it, Nick!
[22:40.530 --> 22:41.270]  Why bother?
[22:41.590 --> 22:42.050]  Why bother?
[22:42.670 --> 22:43.690]  How do I cut my chain?
[22:46.030 --> 22:47.650]  How do I cut Eric off my chain?
[22:54.190 --> 22:55.630]  Don't pull me, I pull you!
[22:57.010 --> 22:58.910]  No, I pull you, you don't pull me.
[22:58.970 --> 22:59.550]  I pull you.
[23:00.650 --> 23:02.850]  I think Eric's a real anchor right now.
[23:06.830 --> 23:07.770]  Eric the anvil.
[23:08.230 --> 23:08.870]  Ah, there you go.
[23:09.570 --> 23:10.050]  Whoops!
[23:10.650 --> 23:11.510]  Alright, alright!
[23:11.690 --> 23:12.710]  Hold on, hold on!
[23:12.910 --> 23:13.490]  Everyone chill!
[23:13.890 --> 23:14.590]  Alright, you...
[23:14.590 --> 23:15.930]  I'll get Geoff.
[23:16.110 --> 23:16.570]  You pull Gavin.
[23:16.590 --> 23:17.350]  I'm already up.
[23:17.370 --> 23:17.850]  Alright, let's go.
[23:24.680 --> 23:27.220]  Remember how slow-going we were at the beginning of this?
[23:28.180 --> 23:28.660]  Alright.
[23:31.120 --> 23:31.600]  Okay.
[23:34.140 --> 23:34.380]  Oops.
[23:35.140 --> 23:36.320]  Just don't fucking fall.
[23:37.660 --> 23:40.240]  The smallest, the smallest...
[23:40.240 --> 23:40.440]  Whoops.
[23:41.960 --> 23:45.140]  Well, he recovered pretty quick, too, so I think it matched the crime.
[23:45.480 --> 23:46.960]  It's a low-stakes chain, alright?
[23:47.560 --> 23:48.320]  Someone's pulling me!
[23:48.560 --> 23:49.400]  Someone's yanking my chain!
[23:49.580 --> 23:50.220]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[23:55.200 --> 23:57.740]  There's just complete silence on this early part.
[24:02.880 --> 24:03.960]  I'm proud of you guys.
[24:04.340 --> 24:05.820]  You guys are doing great on this one.
[24:05.820 --> 24:06.360]  Thanks, Andrew.
[24:06.920 --> 24:07.140]  Appreciate it.
[24:07.480 --> 24:09.440]  I mean, after the last few runs, this is good.
[24:09.940 --> 24:11.340]  We have to record two episodes today.
[24:11.420 --> 24:12.180]  Careful, careful, careful.
[24:12.180 --> 24:12.680]  Okay.
[24:13.120 --> 24:13.480]  Go.
[24:14.280 --> 24:14.580]  Go.
[24:15.180 --> 24:17.460]  Just gonna be us mad at each other later.
[24:17.640 --> 24:18.560]  To the right, to the right.
[24:18.620 --> 24:19.120]  There we go.
[24:19.240 --> 24:20.100]  Okay, and now we're good.
[24:23.020 --> 24:24.820]  Gavin's been in the lead this whole run.
[24:25.020 --> 24:26.060]  He's just been at the front.
[24:26.200 --> 24:28.540]  Well, if our chains aren't taut, it doesn't matter who's in the lead.
[24:29.120 --> 24:30.220]  Well, I don't think that's true.
[24:30.340 --> 24:31.300]  I think there's actually...
[24:31.300 --> 24:33.380]  I think there's something with whoever's in the lead.
[24:34.080 --> 24:34.960]  What do you mean there's something?
[24:35.380 --> 24:40.960]  I think it said in the settings that there was some advantage or whoever was leading had more power.
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.180]  More of an anchor, I think.
[24:44.840 --> 24:45.600]  Alright, ready?
[24:46.960 --> 24:47.680]  Good jump.
[24:48.800 --> 24:49.580]  Good jump.
[24:50.040 --> 24:51.400]  Oh, that was a little close.
[24:51.400 --> 24:51.840]  Way up there.
[24:52.500 --> 24:53.000]  Goddamn.
[24:53.560 --> 24:53.920]  Big jump.
[24:53.940 --> 24:54.400]  All the way up.
[24:55.140 --> 24:55.340]  Oh.
[24:56.260 --> 24:57.480]  Alright, there we go.
[24:57.480 --> 24:58.340]  Nice recovery.
[24:58.340 --> 24:58.840]  There we go.
[24:58.920 --> 24:59.260]  Good job, guys.
[24:59.260 --> 24:59.800]  Good work, boys.
[25:02.340 --> 25:03.300]  Alright, let's do it.
[25:04.160 --> 25:05.200]  Through all the babies.
[25:06.020 --> 25:06.400]  Yeah.
[25:06.880 --> 25:07.220]  Okay.
[25:07.700 --> 25:08.200]  Alright.
[25:08.460 --> 25:09.400]  Who goes first?
[25:09.400 --> 25:10.360]  You go left or right?
[25:10.360 --> 25:10.800]  Oh, am I going again?
[25:10.880 --> 25:11.040]  Okay.
[25:11.320 --> 25:13.240]  I said Eric or me, and then he said, I'll meet ya.
[25:13.320 --> 25:14.060]  No, no, we'll go left.
[25:14.600 --> 25:15.060]  Go left.
[25:17.580 --> 25:18.700]  Is it this first one?
[25:19.880 --> 25:20.600]  I mean...
[25:20.600 --> 25:20.960]  Yeah.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.700]  Trying to remember where you went where we didn't go the right way.
[25:25.820 --> 25:26.080]  I agree.
[25:27.100 --> 25:27.980]  I think it's further.
[25:28.240 --> 25:29.000]  I think it's further up.
[25:31.140 --> 25:31.320]  Ooh.
[25:31.600 --> 25:32.520]  Ooh, a little push.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.200]  Yeah, that was rough.
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.740]  I think it's here.
[25:36.800 --> 25:37.520]  I think we gotta go...
[25:37.520 --> 25:38.460]  We go right here?
[25:38.460 --> 25:38.860]  I think right.
[25:39.560 --> 25:40.060]  You went right.
[25:40.120 --> 25:40.680]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:42.820 --> 25:44.340]  I think last time we went straight.
[25:44.740 --> 25:45.420]  When I went straight.
[25:45.660 --> 25:46.200]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:46.560 --> 25:46.660]  Yeah.
[25:46.760 --> 25:49.040]  Because it looked like it connected, kind of, from that angle?
[25:49.160 --> 25:49.780]  Right, right.
[25:50.040 --> 25:50.660]  It's a trick.
[25:50.900 --> 25:52.180]  It's the devil.
[25:52.320 --> 25:52.800]  He's tricking you.
[25:52.820 --> 25:53.500]  Wow, what a prick.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.000]  It's the devil's greatest trick.
[25:56.400 --> 25:58.000]  Wait, that said it didn't exist.
[25:58.240 --> 25:58.900]  Oh, shit.
[25:59.660 --> 26:02.700]  Do you think this game has been the last straw in a friendship yet?
[26:03.800 --> 26:04.600]  Oh, 100%.
[26:04.600 --> 26:06.240]  Do you think it hasn't?
[26:06.480 --> 26:06.880]  Absolutely.
[26:07.320 --> 26:08.580]  Yeah, I think that's been a...
[26:08.580 --> 26:09.060]  There's no way it hasn't.
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.440]  You're dead to me with an 0F4.
[26:10.780 --> 26:11.380]  Like, uh...
[26:11.380 --> 26:11.520]  Yup.
[26:11.760 --> 26:13.280]  Fucking remove you from my friends list?
[26:13.540 --> 26:13.740]  Yeah.
[26:14.200 --> 26:14.480]  Yup.
[26:14.600 --> 26:15.220]  Oh, definitely.
[26:16.140 --> 26:16.920]  I would love...
[26:16.920 --> 26:21.660]  I wonder what's the most heated argument that this was the, like, ignition point for the fuse.
[26:21.820 --> 26:23.700]  Like, just everything came up with this.
[26:24.500 --> 26:25.720]  Alright, we made it back to Skull Mountain.
[26:26.000 --> 26:26.960]  Skull Mountain, yeah.
[26:27.420 --> 26:27.900]  Up that.
[26:28.100 --> 26:29.020]  Okay, just keep...
[26:29.020 --> 26:30.140]  Climbing up Skull Mountain.
[26:30.140 --> 26:30.640]  Party t-shirt?
[26:31.160 --> 26:31.460]  All the way?
[26:31.860 --> 26:33.840]  Alright, everybody wait until we're all up here.
[26:34.860 --> 26:35.520]  Andrew's right.
[26:35.660 --> 26:35.980]  Okay, ready?
[26:35.980 --> 26:38.260]  It absolutely looks like we're climbing an Ed Hardy t-shirt.
[26:38.340 --> 26:38.980]  Oh, my God!
[26:39.500 --> 26:40.660]  Okay, sync up here.
[26:40.780 --> 26:41.320]  Next one, ready?
[26:41.740 --> 26:42.900]  3, 2, 1, go.
[26:43.560 --> 26:44.180]  Go, go, go.
[26:44.220 --> 26:45.600]  All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way.
[26:45.600 --> 26:46.000]  Oh, nice!
[26:46.180 --> 26:47.040]  Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[26:47.220 --> 26:48.140]  Alright, now what's the thing...
[26:48.140 --> 26:49.740]  Nobody hit Ryan!
[26:50.040 --> 26:50.440]  Okay.
[26:51.640 --> 26:54.880]  Now, let's make sure when we get to the next level, we look up first.
[26:55.740 --> 26:59.740]  So, I think that there's something in the shack over to the left?
[26:59.980 --> 27:00.500]  There is.
[27:00.660 --> 27:03.160]  I can see lasers spinning on the right there.
[27:03.180 --> 27:04.260]  Oh, there is Gavin.
[27:04.520 --> 27:04.840]  Gavin?
[27:04.840 --> 27:06.240]  I want to apologize.
[27:06.540 --> 27:08.220]  It wasn't your fault that we got shot off.
[27:08.280 --> 27:08.640]  Oh, there's spikes.
[27:09.780 --> 27:11.320]  There's spikes that shoot us off.
[27:11.340 --> 27:11.640]  Okay.
[27:11.780 --> 27:13.300]  So, we'll just have to pay attention to that.
[27:13.300 --> 27:13.420]  Look at that.
[27:14.280 --> 27:14.720]  Alright, hang on.
[27:14.900 --> 27:16.040]  Okay, Gavin, Gavin.
[27:16.360 --> 27:17.220]  Should we check the shack though?
[27:17.460 --> 27:17.860]  I'm looking.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.600]  You said look and I looked, you fool.
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.280]  Shack first, boys.
[27:21.460 --> 27:21.620]  Hang on.
[27:22.120 --> 27:23.520]  Yeah, nobody go up, nobody go up.
[27:23.660 --> 27:24.740]  I want to see if there's anything in here.
[27:25.520 --> 27:26.220]  A save point?
[27:26.820 --> 27:28.060]  Imagine there's a jetpack.
[27:28.420 --> 27:28.720]  Of course not.
[27:29.180 --> 27:32.580]  What if it just drops you to the bottom?
[27:33.160 --> 27:33.520]  Curiosity.
[27:33.700 --> 27:33.820]  Okay.
[27:34.640 --> 27:35.580]  I'm going to start.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.520]  Gavin, you come up behind me, but we need space between us.
[27:38.700 --> 27:40.780]  And can you test sprinting on the ladder?
[27:40.880 --> 27:41.640]  Can you get a little boost?
[27:42.160 --> 27:42.640]  No, I don't think so.
[27:42.640 --> 27:43.540]  Yeah, there's no...
[27:43.540 --> 27:44.380]  No, there's no boost.
[27:44.580 --> 27:45.440]  Okay, so it's just timing.
[27:46.160 --> 27:46.260]  Yeah.
[27:47.720 --> 27:48.560]  I'm going to go.
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.340]  Hang on, hang on.
[27:51.480 --> 27:51.960]  Wait, wait, wait.
[27:52.680 --> 27:53.220]  Yeah, we're waiting.
[27:54.480 --> 27:55.240]  Okay, I'm going up.
[27:56.380 --> 27:56.880]  Oh, God.
[27:57.880 --> 27:58.520]  My legs.
[27:58.680 --> 27:59.160]  You pulled me.
[27:59.220 --> 27:59.840]  You pulled me.
[27:59.960 --> 28:00.440]  You pulled me.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.580]  I'm up still.
[28:01.860 --> 28:02.420]  I'm up still.
[28:02.420 --> 28:04.940]  Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
[28:05.020 --> 28:06.020]  What a recovery.
[28:07.400 --> 28:08.800]  Okay, pull Nick, pull Nick.
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.700]  Okay, so let's look at it again.
[28:11.980 --> 28:13.120]  Should we go as a group?
[28:13.320 --> 28:13.880]  We need to go as a group.
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.400]  We should, because I got pushed off by the shins because I couldn't climb any higher.
[28:18.160 --> 28:20.120]  We're going to be all in each other's shit and we all go.
[28:20.120 --> 28:23.500]  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:23.500 --> 28:24.900]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[28:26.300 --> 28:26.780]  Oh, God.
[28:26.860 --> 28:27.880]  There you go.
[28:28.040 --> 28:28.400]  Hang on.
[28:28.540 --> 28:29.820]  Okay, and wait, wait, wait.
[28:30.060 --> 28:30.080]  Nick!
[28:30.400 --> 28:31.820]  Look, I'm getting us as close as possible.
[28:31.820 --> 28:33.540]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[28:33.540 --> 28:34.540]  I don't think that's going to work.
[28:34.900 --> 28:36.100]  I don't think that's going to work.
[28:36.140 --> 28:36.980]  What the hell?
[28:37.360 --> 28:37.700]  No!
[28:38.740 --> 28:39.800]  Pull us up!
[28:40.040 --> 28:40.900]  Pull us up!
[28:41.200 --> 28:41.680]  Pull us up!
[28:42.140 --> 28:42.600]  Eric!
[28:42.760 --> 28:43.400]  Pull us up!
[28:44.880 --> 28:45.360]  Eric!
[28:46.300 --> 28:47.180]  I'm pulling!
[28:47.520 --> 28:48.220]  You're not!
[28:48.800 --> 28:49.600]  Oh, man.
[28:49.620 --> 28:51.120]  Shut the fuck up!
[28:51.420 --> 28:52.020]  Oh, God.
[28:52.580 --> 28:53.340]  What a recovery.
[28:54.700 --> 28:56.120]  Okay, okay, okay.
[28:56.340 --> 28:58.840]  When we're hanging, if you press nothing, you can be pulled easily.
[28:59.420 --> 29:00.120]  Yeah, don't we?
[29:00.120 --> 29:00.600]  Yes.
[29:00.600 --> 29:03.860]  And you can't hold sprint and pull.
[29:03.940 --> 29:04.680]  It won't pull.
[29:05.840 --> 29:06.960]  Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[29:06.980 --> 29:07.340]  Right here.
[29:07.920 --> 29:08.280]  And wait.
[29:09.360 --> 29:09.760]  Go!
[29:12.020 --> 29:13.540]  Okay, I'll show you where to wait.
[29:13.680 --> 29:14.080]  God!
[29:14.920 --> 29:15.720]  What happened?
[29:16.040 --> 29:16.280]  It's okay, it's okay.
[29:16.580 --> 29:18.020]  Oh, we're here, we're here, we're here.
[29:18.320 --> 29:18.540]  Oh!
[29:18.840 --> 29:20.220]  We didn't go fast enough.
[29:20.760 --> 29:21.300]  We didn't go fast enough.
[29:21.300 --> 29:22.800]  We didn't go quick enough after it came.
[29:23.080 --> 29:23.180]  Yeah.
[29:23.460 --> 29:24.640]  Who, what do you mean we?
[29:24.720 --> 29:25.160]  Who's we?
[29:25.260 --> 29:25.660]  What's we?
[29:25.900 --> 29:27.160]  I felt like we made that.
[29:27.220 --> 29:27.600]  When you said go, it was already too late.
[29:27.600 --> 29:28.820]  When you said go, it was already too late.
[29:28.820 --> 29:30.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:30.180 --> 29:30.800]  Nick is right.
[29:30.940 --> 29:32.040]  When you said go, it was too late.
[29:32.460 --> 29:33.500]  All right, why don't we have Nick call the goods?
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.540]  Okay, so somebody else needs to say it because I must be, I must be lagging.
[29:36.540 --> 29:37.600]  It was just that time.
[29:37.760 --> 29:38.140]  It was just that one time.
[29:38.140 --> 29:39.460]  Yeah, you were right the first time.
[29:39.460 --> 29:40.340]  It was fine other times.
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.760]  I mean, someone else make the call-out.
[29:42.820 --> 29:42.960]  Okay.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.620]  If we feel stronger about someone else making the call-out, that's totally fine.
[29:45.700 --> 29:47.540]  Wait until everyone is inside each other.
[29:47.600 --> 29:48.500]  Come inside me here.
[29:48.540 --> 29:48.700]  Get inside.
[29:48.740 --> 29:49.520]  Okay, let's wait again.
[29:49.680 --> 29:51.120]  Next cycle, next cycle.
[29:51.480 --> 29:52.440]  Who's calling it out?
[29:52.460 --> 29:52.740]  I will.
[29:53.420 --> 29:53.720]  Now!
[29:56.200 --> 29:57.320]  I thought there'd be a countdown.
[29:57.940 --> 29:58.720]  But, I mean, hey, it worked.
[29:59.280 --> 30:00.580]  Stay down, stay down, stay down.
[30:00.740 --> 30:02.080]  Come up to me, come up to me, come up to me.
[30:02.120 --> 30:02.520]  Wait, wait.
[30:02.600 --> 30:03.240]  We'll wait for the next one.
[30:03.560 --> 30:04.560]  Okay, Nick's calling it out.
[30:05.100 --> 30:05.340]  Go!
[30:05.660 --> 30:05.740]  Go!
[30:09.180 --> 30:09.700]  There's no more.
[30:09.760 --> 30:11.300]  All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way, all the way.
[30:11.340 --> 30:11.720]  You're welcome.
[30:11.840 --> 30:12.220]  I got it.
[30:12.260 --> 30:12.500]  Yes.
[30:12.680 --> 30:13.240]  Now we go to the right.
[30:13.240 --> 30:13.960]  Good work, Nick.
[30:13.980 --> 30:14.320]  Thank you.
[30:14.480 --> 30:15.660]  Good fucking work, man.
[30:16.200 --> 30:17.140]  Is there anything in the shack?
[30:18.540 --> 30:18.940]  Yeah, I'm scared.
[30:19.120 --> 30:20.080]  I'm scared of the right shacks, I'll be honest.
[30:20.740 --> 30:21.540]  Can we sleep?
[30:23.120 --> 30:23.880]  I have a little nap.
[30:23.920 --> 30:24.460]  Can you climb this?
[30:24.860 --> 30:25.180]  Oh, look.
[30:25.280 --> 30:25.680]  Oh, I think we should.
[30:26.480 --> 30:27.560]  Yeah, but it doesn't go anywhere.
[30:27.560 --> 30:28.660]  What's the point?
[30:29.520 --> 30:29.940]  Yeah, I don't know.
[30:29.940 --> 30:30.800]  I don't have a kid.
[30:31.140 --> 30:33.040]  Okay, there's a ladder here to this side.
[30:33.160 --> 30:34.040]  Is there anything on the other side?
[30:34.180 --> 30:34.420]  Let's go see.
[30:34.760 --> 30:36.020]  Uh, not that I see.
[30:39.020 --> 30:39.740]  Jesus Christ.
[30:41.440 --> 30:42.880]  Okay, all right, let's do the ladder.
[30:43.000 --> 30:43.540]  Let's make it happen.
[30:46.040 --> 30:49.160]  There's some real unfortunate phrasing when we were stuck inside each other.
[30:49.900 --> 30:53.000]  Eric wanted to go right, and half of you were running left going,
[30:53.220 --> 30:54.960]  no, I don't think there's anything over there.
[30:58.060 --> 30:59.080]  Yeah, I don't see anything.
[30:59.100 --> 30:59.700]  Yeah, you're not moving.
[31:00.760 --> 31:01.400]  Oh, God.
[31:02.220 --> 31:02.540]  Fellas.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.540]  Oh, fuck me.
[31:04.860 --> 31:06.000]  Hang on, hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[31:06.160 --> 31:08.120]  Wait, let's think about this before we go.
[31:08.340 --> 31:09.340]  How do we want to do this?
[31:09.420 --> 31:11.040]  We'll just all jump at the same time.
[31:11.500 --> 31:12.040]  Okay, ready?
[31:12.720 --> 31:13.340]  We're gonna go.
[31:13.460 --> 31:14.200]  Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[31:14.260 --> 31:15.320]  We're gonna go on the next one, okay?
[31:15.520 --> 31:16.280]  All right, Nick, get closer.
[31:16.540 --> 31:16.900]  We're gonna go on the next one.
[31:16.920 --> 31:17.600]  Now, when are you jumping?
[31:18.040 --> 31:19.320]  When it's going away from you or...
[31:19.320 --> 31:20.400]  Okay, that is...
[31:20.400 --> 31:20.900]  What happened?
[31:21.180 --> 31:22.460]  Why did everyone do an idiot?
[31:22.820 --> 31:23.880]  What is everyone doing?
[31:24.100 --> 31:25.960]  Why did everyone do an idiot?
[31:25.960 --> 31:26.900]  Gavin, pull us!
[31:26.900 --> 31:27.780]  You gotta pull us up.
[31:27.940 --> 31:28.380]  Gavin.
[31:28.640 --> 31:29.900]  Well, hold on, I...
[31:30.580 --> 31:32.200]  Gavin, it's up to you.
[31:32.340 --> 31:32.660]  Oh, God.
[31:32.800 --> 31:34.340]  Get off the other side.
[31:34.740 --> 31:35.500]  I'm trying to pull.
[31:35.940 --> 31:37.120]  You absolute sausages.
[31:37.620 --> 31:39.500]  You went at the weirdest time.
[31:41.320 --> 31:42.540]  Geoff, look at me.
[31:42.880 --> 31:43.420]  Geoff, look at me.
[31:44.100 --> 31:44.140]  Geoff, pull up, Eric.
[31:44.140 --> 31:45.040]  Oh, my God.
[31:45.260 --> 31:45.480]  Ryan.
[31:45.960 --> 31:47.420]  Geoff, you're facing the wrong way, Eric.
[31:47.880 --> 31:49.440]  You gotta pull me, Geoff.
[31:49.840 --> 31:50.300]  Oh, no!
[31:52.560 --> 31:53.940]  Gavin, pull me up.
[31:53.960 --> 31:54.360]  What is everyone...
[31:54.360 --> 31:55.320]  I'll stay in there with you.
[31:55.500 --> 31:56.680]  Here, I'm right here.
[31:56.680 --> 31:57.300]  Gavin's gone.
[31:57.460 --> 31:58.180]  I'm right here.
[31:58.180 --> 31:59.140]  Oh, God.
[31:59.960 --> 32:00.500]  I gotcha.
[32:00.620 --> 32:01.660]  Nice transition.
[32:02.500 --> 32:02.880]  How'd you do that?
[32:02.920 --> 32:04.900]  Everyone, everyone, everyone shut up.
[32:05.200 --> 32:05.940]  Everyone relax.
[32:06.360 --> 32:07.300]  Everyone relax.
[32:07.820 --> 32:08.700]  Everyone relax.
[32:08.780 --> 32:09.540]  Everybody's relaxed.
[32:10.200 --> 32:11.080]  Everyone relax.
[32:11.460 --> 32:12.040]  Everyone's relaxed.
[32:12.060 --> 32:13.240]  Everyone shut up.
[32:13.260 --> 32:13.700]  Everyone shut up.
[32:13.700 --> 32:14.620]  And everyone relax.
[32:15.540 --> 32:17.880]  Everyone shut the fuck up and everyone relax.
[32:17.940 --> 32:18.880]  See, now we got it.
[32:19.060 --> 32:19.940]  That's all we had to do.
[32:20.020 --> 32:21.720]  That's all we had to do was calm down.
[32:22.200 --> 32:22.820]  That's all we had to do was calm down.
[32:22.820 --> 32:26.660]  All we had to do was listen to Eric say shut up to himself for 5 minutes.
[32:28.400 --> 32:30.380]  Wait, let's talk about what happened.
[32:30.500 --> 32:31.320]  Did people overshoot?
[32:32.000 --> 32:32.960]  No, we jumped too late.
[32:33.040 --> 32:33.160]  We undershot.
[32:33.600 --> 32:34.200]  We jumped too late.
[32:34.340 --> 32:35.940]  So, here's what happened.
[32:36.100 --> 32:41.880]  When I walked towards it, I jumped, but it grabbed the edge and I started climbing.
[32:42.060 --> 32:42.260]  Yeah, same.
[32:42.820 --> 32:48.940]  So, we need to wait until I think it's swinging towards us to jump on it.
[32:49.100 --> 32:49.320]  Okay.
[32:49.680 --> 32:50.120]  Alright, ready?
[32:50.640 --> 32:50.960]  Ready?
[32:51.340 --> 32:51.560]  Ready?
[32:52.380 --> 32:52.900]  Now.
[32:54.800 --> 32:55.900]  You bunch of...
[32:57.060 --> 32:58.900]  What is wrong with everyone?
[32:59.840 --> 33:00.480]  No, you did it.
[33:00.620 --> 33:01.460]  I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
[33:01.480 --> 33:03.860]  We might have just overjumped a bit.
[33:04.000 --> 33:04.420]  There you go.
[33:04.840 --> 33:05.080]  Yes.
[33:05.660 --> 33:06.260]  Okay, hang on.
[33:06.500 --> 33:07.820]  Hang on, hang on, hang on!
[33:09.200 --> 33:09.680]  Geoff!
[33:10.540 --> 33:10.820]  Geoff!
[33:10.820 --> 33:11.680]  This is like the begin...
[33:14.200 --> 33:15.380]  Okay, so.
[33:15.820 --> 33:17.820]  So, this is 100% on Gavin.
[33:18.320 --> 33:19.960]  This is absolutely on Gavin.
[33:20.300 --> 33:22.140]  This is like baby beginning shit.
[33:22.720 --> 33:25.640]  This is totally on Gavin.
[33:26.580 --> 33:27.060]  100%.
[33:28.460 --> 33:31.680]  I've been slung all over the place. Stop pulling me.
[33:32.120 --> 33:33.400]  Gavin, stop pulling!
[33:34.200 --> 33:36.560]  I'm not... I'm not pressing anything.
[33:37.280 --> 33:38.380]  You gotta pull me up, Gavin.
[33:38.380 --> 33:40.680]  I can't, I'm fucking sliding all over the map.
[33:40.820 --> 33:42.220]  Is nobody else sliding?
[33:43.260 --> 33:43.740]  No.
[33:44.380 --> 33:45.840]  Can you see my character sliding?
[33:46.340 --> 33:47.860]  Yeah, you're slipping. Chill out.
[33:47.920 --> 33:48.600]  I mean, I'm hanging out.
[33:48.620 --> 33:49.660]  I can't do anything!
[33:49.940 --> 33:50.180]  No!
[33:50.220 --> 33:52.320]  It just moves. You're pulling me.
[33:53.180 --> 33:54.780]  Everyone press nothing if you're hanging.
[33:54.780 --> 33:56.780]  You yanked us to hell!
[33:58.300 --> 33:58.740]  Okay.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.620]  That is 100% the people who were hanging's fault.
[34:01.980 --> 34:05.620]  That's on Ga... That is absolute... Gavin just started going.
[34:05.960 --> 34:08.020]  We got through the hard part and Gavin went,
[34:08.180 --> 34:09.880]  I'll just go. I'm in the middle. I'll just go.
[34:09.900 --> 34:12.820]  Wasn't that a bit like the beginning where it's just easy, quick jumps?
[34:13.360 --> 34:14.920]  But we didn't talk about it first!
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.020]  After everything we did, are you out of your mind?
[34:21.020 --> 34:22.940]  Are you fucking crazy?
[34:24.900 --> 34:28.020]  I've never been so sweaty in all my fucking life!
[34:28.420 --> 34:29.660]  I'm getting soaked.
[34:31.100 --> 34:33.020]  I don't want to come up.
[34:33.480 --> 34:36.240]  I want to be down here. No. I want to be down here.
[34:37.040 --> 34:38.200]  Oh, you will be soon enough.
[34:39.500 --> 34:40.160]  Yeah, don't worry.
[34:40.280 --> 34:41.480]  That bit was just like this part.
[34:41.840 --> 34:42.120]  No!
[34:43.060 --> 34:45.300]  We need to look ahead!
[34:47.200 --> 34:49.560]  These pieces are much bigger than those ones.
[34:50.120 --> 34:50.500]  Are they?
[34:51.060 --> 34:51.260]  Yeah.
[34:51.600 --> 34:51.980]  Yes!
[34:52.680 --> 34:55.980]  You know what? The time I apologized for the ladder stuff...
[34:56.900 --> 34:57.520]  You didn't mean it?
[34:57.700 --> 34:58.940]  No, it doesn't count.
[34:59.980 --> 35:01.540]  No, you have to apologize again.
[35:02.920 --> 35:03.920]  That doesn't count.
[35:04.640 --> 35:05.660]  I don't know.
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.740]  I do! I know!
[35:09.860 --> 35:11.680]  Seems like a good time to use an enemy bullet.
[35:13.680 --> 35:21.960]  Gavin, I think I'm gonna...
[35:22.680 --> 35:24.420]  It sounds like the others don't.
[35:24.660 --> 35:26.160]  If you line us all up, Gavin, you might get us.
[35:26.180 --> 35:27.020]  I definitely think...
[35:27.020 --> 35:29.820]  I think that if I win, I go to hell...
[35:29.820 --> 35:30.980]  and this is the only way out.
[35:31.100 --> 35:31.720]  I think I'll just stay.
[35:35.040 --> 35:36.480]  Maybe I can trade some of it...
[35:36.480 --> 35:38.400]  because on that swinging pendulum part...
[35:38.400 --> 35:39.360]  when I had to pull people up...
[35:39.360 --> 35:41.720]  maybe I can just trade my apology against that.
[35:41.940 --> 35:42.560]  That's pretty good.
[35:43.340 --> 35:46.120]  Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[35:46.200 --> 35:46.740]  Wait, wait, wait.
[35:46.920 --> 35:47.100]  Go!
[35:50.200 --> 35:53.020]  I mean, you guys are just so much better at that.
[35:53.160 --> 35:53.900]  Let's go to the right.
[35:54.040 --> 35:54.560]  God damn.
[35:55.120 --> 35:55.280]  What?
[35:55.340 --> 35:56.000]  Alright, we'll go to the left.
[35:57.460 --> 35:58.460]  What are you dabbing me for?
[35:59.100 --> 36:00.300]  We didn't. I said let's do it this time.
[36:00.820 --> 36:01.000]  Oh.
[36:01.420 --> 36:01.640]  Yeah.
[36:03.660 --> 36:05.620]  It looks like it's slightly closer to go to the right.
[36:05.960 --> 36:06.680]  Oh my god.
[36:06.860 --> 36:10.300]  What we're not great at is grabbing the earlier parts of the map on the way down.
[36:10.760 --> 36:10.980]  Yep.
[36:11.080 --> 36:11.320]  No.
[36:11.680 --> 36:13.080]  Oh, I tried so hard.
[36:13.140 --> 36:14.560]  I was swinging my whole fucking body...
[36:14.560 --> 36:14.680]  Yep.
[36:14.680 --> 36:16.440]  ...towards anything I could land on.
[36:16.700 --> 36:18.120]  I was trying so hard.
[36:18.240 --> 36:18.660]  Alright, ready?
[36:19.540 --> 36:19.820]  Yeah.
[36:19.960 --> 36:20.100]  Yep.
[36:20.420 --> 36:21.200]  Three, two, go.
[36:22.540 --> 36:22.980]  Oh shit.
[36:23.460 --> 36:23.820]  Oh shit.
[36:24.220 --> 36:24.620]  Ooh.
[36:25.220 --> 36:25.700]  Ooh.
[36:26.460 --> 36:26.940]  Ooh.
[36:27.320 --> 36:27.340]  Ooh.
[36:27.340 --> 36:27.520]  Ooh.
[36:30.300 --> 36:30.780]  Nice.
[36:30.960 --> 36:31.200]  Nice.
[36:31.460 --> 36:32.040]  Good job.
[36:32.180 --> 36:32.460]  I'm coming.
[36:34.260 --> 36:35.280]  Alright, Nick, just make it.
[36:35.340 --> 36:35.520]  Yep.
[36:35.520 --> 36:35.740]  Let's go.
[36:37.240 --> 36:37.720]  Yep.
[36:38.260 --> 36:38.880]  Alright, Derek.
[36:42.780 --> 36:43.100]  Oh.
[36:43.100 --> 36:43.500]  Alright.
[36:44.720 --> 36:47.240]  Yeah, these earlier parts are a little quiet.
[36:50.580 --> 36:51.020]  Oh.
[36:52.860 --> 36:53.540]  Andrew, how you doing?
[36:54.260 --> 36:54.860]  I'm great.
[36:55.640 --> 36:56.460]  You guys are locked in.
[36:56.500 --> 36:57.800]  It's doing amazing.
[36:59.800 --> 37:03.180]  Took you 12 minutes-ish to get to this point on your first run.
[37:03.960 --> 37:04.140]  Yeah.
[37:04.820 --> 37:05.760]  What's someone done?
[37:06.120 --> 37:06.400]  Gavin.
[37:06.920 --> 37:07.740]  No, no.
[37:07.940 --> 37:09.080]  Gavin, that's you.
[37:09.180 --> 37:09.460]  Get up there.
[37:09.540 --> 37:10.740]  Yeah, but I just got yanked sideways.
[37:10.740 --> 37:11.360]  You are...
[37:11.360 --> 37:12.720]  You fell by yourself.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.520]  What's someone done?
[37:14.820 --> 37:15.880]  Are you someone?
[37:16.320 --> 37:17.080]  What have you done?
[37:17.740 --> 37:19.600]  I just got pulled off the side.
[37:20.280 --> 37:21.260]  No, didn't look like it.
[37:21.360 --> 37:21.880]  No, I don't think so.
[37:21.900 --> 37:23.700]  My pace has been the same the whole time.
[37:23.920 --> 37:24.660]  Watch the replay.
[37:25.020 --> 37:26.540]  I'm not even keeping the chain taut.
[37:27.040 --> 37:28.660]  I'm giving you so much slack.
[37:28.800 --> 37:29.900]  Ooh, I'm giving you so much slack.
[37:29.940 --> 37:32.160]  This might as well be called slack together.
[37:34.560 --> 37:35.980]  That's what we use for work.
[37:36.400 --> 37:36.840]  Thank you, Nick.
[37:37.220 --> 37:37.580]  Thank you, Nick.
[37:37.720 --> 37:38.780]  You ever played Doom Backwards?
[37:39.820 --> 37:41.380]  That was a real Doom Backwards joke.
[37:41.520 --> 37:42.480]  Yeah, it really was.
[37:42.980 --> 37:44.120]  Hey, everyone up.
[37:44.180 --> 37:44.580]  Don't jump on it.
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.520]  Don't jump on it.
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.060]  That's a mood.
[37:49.600 --> 37:50.700]  Okay, here we go.
[37:50.760 --> 37:51.040]  Hang on.
[37:51.120 --> 37:51.420]  Hang on.
[37:51.520 --> 37:52.240]  The next one.
[37:52.820 --> 37:53.660]  And then we're running.
[37:53.780 --> 37:53.940]  Ready?
[37:54.040 --> 37:54.240]  Go.
[37:55.440 --> 37:57.200]  And then all the way.
[37:57.620 --> 37:57.780]  Yep.
[37:58.020 --> 37:58.440]  There we go.
[37:58.620 --> 37:58.880]  Easy.
[37:59.380 --> 38:00.060]  Easy as that.
[38:00.500 --> 38:01.220]  Oh, my God.
[38:02.080 --> 38:02.400]  Nick.
[38:02.520 --> 38:02.820]  Nick.
[38:03.180 --> 38:03.260]  Nick.
[38:03.260 --> 38:03.380]  Nick.
[38:03.380 --> 38:04.100]  What the hell happened?
[38:05.240 --> 38:07.500]  You started climbing left and right.
[38:09.660 --> 38:11.860]  No one climbs a ladder like that, okay?
[38:13.180 --> 38:14.260]  Right, I agree.
[38:14.420 --> 38:15.180]  So why did you?
[38:15.280 --> 38:16.200]  Well, that's on me.
[38:16.340 --> 38:17.360]  That's physics for you.
[38:18.960 --> 38:20.380]  Is it physics or is it Nick?
[38:20.700 --> 38:21.640]  Well, yeah.
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.660]  I was like Nick went to get a sip of water or something.
[38:25.240 --> 38:25.940]  All right, hold on.
[38:26.140 --> 38:27.020]  Let's bunch up.
[38:27.280 --> 38:27.380]  Hang on.
[38:28.060 --> 38:28.340]  Go.
[38:28.640 --> 38:29.200]  Hang on.
[38:29.380 --> 38:30.140]  Go, go, go.
[38:30.160 --> 38:30.520]  Back it down.
[38:30.520 --> 38:32.660]  Back down.
[38:33.540 --> 38:34.540]  Everybody get in place.
[38:34.960 --> 38:35.060]  All right.
[38:35.060 --> 38:35.820]  Everybody join me.
[38:36.100 --> 38:37.020]  Okay, I'm in place.
[38:37.500 --> 38:38.240]  Nick, you call it out.
[38:39.060 --> 38:40.620]  Only one person can call it.
[38:41.400 --> 38:41.780]  Yes.
[38:42.080 --> 38:42.260]  All right.
[38:42.260 --> 38:43.740]  I don't know why Geoff called it.
[38:43.960 --> 38:44.440]  Wait right here.
[38:44.600 --> 38:44.980]  Wait right here.
[38:45.140 --> 38:45.560]  Wait right here.
[38:47.900 --> 38:48.340]  Go.
[38:51.240 --> 38:52.260]  There you go.
[38:52.560 --> 38:52.960]  All right.
[38:53.140 --> 38:53.960]  That bit is tense.
[38:54.180 --> 38:55.160]  It sure is.
[38:55.960 --> 38:58.300]  I'm sweating so hard I hate this.
[38:58.300 --> 39:00.880]  My fingers are soaked.
[39:03.440 --> 39:05.880]  If my hands could sweat, they'd be wet right now.
[39:09.920 --> 39:11.600]  Okay, so what's the plan?
[39:12.660 --> 39:13.100]  All right.
[39:13.120 --> 39:13.920]  It was last time.
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.580]  Do it again, but don't over jump.
[39:16.120 --> 39:16.460]  Hang on.
[39:16.460 --> 39:17.120]  Okay, hang on.
[39:17.220 --> 39:17.840]  Everyone stop.
[39:17.960 --> 39:18.380]  Everyone stop.
[39:18.420 --> 39:18.820]  Don't go.
[39:19.340 --> 39:20.280]  Who is calling it out?
[39:20.280 --> 39:21.180]  Nick is calling everything.
[39:21.500 --> 39:23.220]  Oh, that's a lot.
[39:23.300 --> 39:24.420]  Okay, we'll wait until it comes back.
[39:24.760 --> 39:25.080]  And...
[39:25.080 --> 39:25.740]  It's the shot caller.
[39:26.180 --> 39:26.400]  Now!
[39:29.860 --> 39:32.600]  Everyone keeps jumping the goddamn over that.
[39:32.760 --> 39:33.040]  It's fine.
[39:33.100 --> 39:33.520]  We're fine.
[39:33.580 --> 39:33.900]  We're fine.
[39:33.980 --> 39:34.440]  Yeah, but look.
[39:34.580 --> 39:35.100]  Look at where we're at.
[39:35.260 --> 39:35.440]  Now, Gavin.
[39:36.080 --> 39:36.560]  50% made it.
[39:36.680 --> 39:37.040]  Not that time.
[39:37.140 --> 39:37.440]  You're good.
[39:37.540 --> 39:38.000]  I got you.
[39:38.140 --> 39:39.060]  Gavin, I have you.
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.120]  You just pull him up back up.
[39:40.480 --> 39:41.200]  Pull him up back up.
[39:41.260 --> 39:41.820]  Easy as that.
[39:42.180 --> 39:42.700]  Easy as that.
[39:42.780 --> 39:42.940]  All right.
[39:43.100 --> 39:43.680]  There you go.
[39:44.000 --> 39:44.800]  Geoff, we got you.
[39:44.900 --> 39:45.240]  Thank you.
[39:45.320 --> 39:45.520]  We got you.
[39:45.580 --> 39:46.100]  Just pull him up.
[39:46.380 --> 39:47.080]  Geoff, you got to turn around.
[39:47.240 --> 39:47.520]  Okay.
[39:48.220 --> 39:49.700]  Now, Eric, you lead the way on this.
[39:49.700 --> 39:50.400]  So, let's wait.
[39:51.040 --> 39:51.660]  Let's wait.
[39:51.820 --> 39:52.740]  Because here's the thing.
[39:53.120 --> 39:55.020]  That wheel is going to move.
[39:55.200 --> 39:55.620]  Oh, shit.
[39:56.220 --> 39:56.580]  So...
[39:57.400 --> 39:57.760]  Like...
[39:58.560 --> 39:59.460]  You fucking dunce.
[40:00.500 --> 40:01.220]  You numpty.
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.680]  You fucking idiot.
[40:03.260 --> 40:05.500]  Of course, this is what happens when you look ahead.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.280]  You look to your right, Eric.
[40:07.300 --> 40:08.100]  That wheel is going to move.
[40:08.540 --> 40:08.920]  What's that?
[40:09.140 --> 40:10.080]  Look to your right.
[40:10.260 --> 40:12.040]  There looks like there's some stairs or something over there.
[40:12.080 --> 40:12.940]  I don't know if that's a thing.
[40:13.660 --> 40:13.900]  Do that.
[40:14.240 --> 40:14.740]  What stairs?
[40:14.980 --> 40:15.500]  Right in front of you.
[40:16.060 --> 40:16.820]  Like this, you mean?
[40:16.960 --> 40:17.580]  Yeah, that.
[40:17.740 --> 40:18.360]  That looks slimy.
[40:18.360 --> 40:20.500]  No, I think that's just geometry teasing you.
[40:21.040 --> 40:21.360]  Okay.
[40:22.100 --> 40:23.100]  Yeah, I wouldn't mess with it.
[40:23.100 --> 40:23.880]  I don't think it leads anywhere.
[40:24.140 --> 40:24.440]  No way.
[40:24.660 --> 40:25.320]  There's nowhere to go.
[40:25.540 --> 40:25.600]  Okay.
[40:26.280 --> 40:27.480]  It was a good thought.
[40:27.620 --> 40:28.000]  It was a good thought.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.040]  So...
[40:29.040 --> 40:29.980]  Here's what I'm predicting with this.
[40:30.120 --> 40:33.920]  If we just treat it like the beginning, surely there'll be so little time spent on the wheel,
[40:33.980 --> 40:34.700]  we'll just keep hopping.
[40:35.380 --> 40:36.560]  So, here's what I'm thinking.
[40:36.780 --> 40:36.920]  Okay.
[40:36.920 --> 40:38.140]  We have to go together again.
[40:38.440 --> 40:38.520]  Yep.
[40:38.520 --> 40:39.800]  I think we have to go together again.
[40:39.800 --> 40:39.940]  Alright.
[40:40.180 --> 40:41.960]  So, Nick, do you want to call it out?
[40:42.280 --> 40:42.560]  Alright.
[40:43.360 --> 40:43.680]  Uh...
[40:43.680 --> 40:45.440]  You can say no if you don't want to.
[40:45.500 --> 40:46.220]  Yeah, I'll do it on this one.
[40:46.560 --> 40:46.900]  Alright, ready?
[40:46.900 --> 40:47.080]  Wait.
[40:47.280 --> 40:47.500]  Okay.
[40:47.620 --> 40:48.380]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[40:48.620 --> 40:50.040]  Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[40:50.300 --> 40:53.960]  When we land on the square cube box, are we just jumping straight again?
[40:54.000 --> 40:54.160]  Yes.
[40:54.160 --> 40:54.560]  Or are we stopping?
[40:54.620 --> 40:55.020]  No, no, no.
[40:55.100 --> 40:56.500]  I think we have to go.
[40:56.600 --> 40:57.800]  I think it's go, go, go.
[40:57.820 --> 40:58.780]  Oh, boy, I'm glad we talked.
[40:58.820 --> 40:59.980]  Okay, boy, I'm glad we talked.
[41:00.460 --> 41:01.080]  Go, go, go.
[41:02.020 --> 41:02.240]  Alright.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.840]  I think once we hit it, we just keep going.
[41:04.860 --> 41:05.040]  Okay.
[41:05.200 --> 41:05.320]  Yeah.
[41:05.600 --> 41:05.940]  Here we go.
[41:05.940 --> 41:07.440]  Once we get to the platform beyond it.
[41:07.940 --> 41:08.240]  Hang on.
[41:08.300 --> 41:09.140]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:09.860 --> 41:10.140]  Okay.
[41:11.780 --> 41:12.640]  40 minutes in.
[41:13.100 --> 41:13.260]  Yep.
[41:13.340 --> 41:14.500]  And 225 meters up.
[41:14.580 --> 41:16.000]  Look at where our dot is on the line.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.200]  Oh, my God.
[41:20.980 --> 41:22.980]  We're like maybe 5% up this.
[41:23.300 --> 41:24.500]  That's the most depressing.
[41:24.760 --> 41:26.320]  I didn't even know that line was there.
[41:26.740 --> 41:28.020]  Yeah, I wish you hadn't told me that.
[41:28.140 --> 41:29.700]  I just assumed that was a bunch.
[41:30.340 --> 41:30.480]  Alright.
[41:31.540 --> 41:31.900]  Alright.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.400]  Okay, I'll give us a 3, 2, 1, go.
[41:33.400 --> 41:34.000]  Are you gonna call it out?
[41:34.120 --> 41:35.460]  I'll give us a 3, 2, 1, go.
[41:35.900 --> 41:36.120]  Okay.
[41:36.120 --> 41:38.060]  Okay, so go is go, Gavin, not one.
[41:38.360 --> 41:38.940]  Yep, yep.
[41:39.060 --> 41:39.160]  Ready?
[41:39.420 --> 41:39.560]  Okay.
[41:39.680 --> 41:41.560]  3, 2, 1, go.
[41:45.580 --> 41:46.200]  Oh, it didn't spin.
[41:46.660 --> 41:47.180]  It's alright.
[41:47.180 --> 41:47.760]  Pull up, Geoff.
[41:48.240 --> 41:48.840]  Everyone stop.
[41:48.940 --> 41:49.280]  Everyone stop.
[41:49.520 --> 41:49.660]  Stop!
[41:50.240 --> 41:51.020]  Okay, it's fine.
[41:51.100 --> 41:51.320]  It's fine.
[41:51.380 --> 41:51.600]  It's fine.
[41:51.760 --> 41:53.000]  Okay, that wheel did not move.
[41:53.920 --> 41:54.120]  Yep.
[41:54.940 --> 41:55.260]  Interesting.
[41:55.980 --> 41:56.420]  We're good.
[41:56.540 --> 41:56.640]  We're good.
[41:56.740 --> 41:56.880]  We're good.
[41:56.880 --> 41:57.920]  No, no, no.
[41:58.160 --> 41:58.400]  Gavin.
[41:58.460 --> 41:58.760]  Gavin.
[41:58.820 --> 41:59.000]  Gavin.
[41:59.040 --> 42:00.320]  I got pulled off the other edge.
[42:01.180 --> 42:01.920]  I got you, Geoff.
[42:02.000 --> 42:02.320]  I got you.
[42:02.380 --> 42:02.860]  I got Geoff.
[42:03.560 --> 42:03.880]  Okay.
[42:05.240 --> 42:05.560]  Alright.
[42:05.720 --> 42:06.240]  Okay, are you up?
[42:06.320 --> 42:07.080]  Okay, Gavin, jump up.
[42:07.180 --> 42:08.040]  Now Geoff.
[42:08.520 --> 42:08.800]  Now me.
[42:09.080 --> 42:09.640]  I'm going forward.
[42:09.800 --> 42:10.280]  There we go.
[42:10.280 --> 42:13.580]  That was not nearly as bad as it appeared it could have been.
[42:13.700 --> 42:14.400]  Okay, okay.
[42:14.400 --> 42:16.980]  I think all the talking about it made it so complicated we should have just gone.
[42:18.820 --> 42:19.160]  Okay.
[42:20.440 --> 42:21.120]  We just go?
[42:21.240 --> 42:21.820]  We cross bridge.
[42:22.900 --> 42:23.020]  Yeah.
[42:23.160 --> 42:24.220]  But hang on, hang on, okay.
[42:24.540 --> 42:25.340]  Okay, Gavin says go.
[42:25.820 --> 42:27.980]  I think there's a thing that's going to hit us.
[42:28.120 --> 42:28.280]  No.
[42:28.700 --> 42:30.900]  Okay, this is little leap hurdles.
[42:30.900 --> 42:32.780]  Oh my god, we have to jump those?
[42:33.020 --> 42:33.620]  Yeah, we'll be fine.
[42:33.700 --> 42:34.520]  This is like Mario Party.
[42:34.680 --> 42:35.360]  We'll get on it now.
[42:35.860 --> 42:36.120]  Alright?
[42:36.260 --> 42:36.680]  We'll get on it now.
[42:36.680 --> 42:38.060]  Yeah, we can walk on to it.
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.020]  Walk on?
[42:39.020 --> 42:39.840]  Yeah, walk on.
[42:40.020 --> 42:41.880]  And then it's just a case of simple jumps.
[42:42.200 --> 42:42.380]  Jumpy.
[42:43.940 --> 42:44.420]  Jumpy.
[42:44.840 --> 42:45.280]  Jumpy.
[42:45.500 --> 42:46.700]  Oh, shit.
[42:46.860 --> 42:48.460]  That looks so messy.
[42:48.960 --> 42:49.280]  Shit.
[42:49.960 --> 42:50.400]  You know what?
[42:50.760 --> 42:51.500]  That's all that matters.
[42:51.960 --> 42:52.260]  It's okay.
[42:52.620 --> 42:56.020]  I was a big fan of a simple walk on and Geoff jumped.
[42:56.320 --> 42:56.540]  Yeah, me too.
[42:56.960 --> 42:58.520]  I just gotta be safe.
[42:59.120 --> 43:00.960]  Do you think those ropes are real?
[43:01.620 --> 43:01.840]  Yeah.
[43:02.300 --> 43:02.880]  What about them?
[43:02.960 --> 43:03.180]  I don't think so.
[43:03.720 --> 43:04.600]  I really don't think so.
[43:04.600 --> 43:05.980]  Why don't we test it?
[43:06.980 --> 43:08.120]  Wait, you want to test it?
[43:08.240 --> 43:09.020]  There's nothing to land on.
[43:09.380 --> 43:09.960]  No, there's nothing to land on.
[43:09.960 --> 43:10.920]  You can pull me right back.
[43:12.180 --> 43:13.280]  Do you think you'll make it over there?
[43:13.560 --> 43:14.800]  I mean, I'll make it to the barrel first.
[43:15.040 --> 43:16.940]  Here, let's go to this first barrel and try.
[43:17.900 --> 43:19.840]  Okay, Gavin leading the way for some reason.
[43:20.180 --> 43:20.860]  Weird, Gavin.
[43:21.260 --> 43:21.640]  Hey, Gavin.
[43:22.080 --> 43:22.740]  Why'd you do that?
[43:23.340 --> 43:24.520]  You gotta pull me up.
[43:24.740 --> 43:25.460]  Pull me, Nick.
[43:25.660 --> 43:26.560]  There's a dragon.
[43:26.740 --> 43:26.780]  I got you.
[43:27.100 --> 43:27.460]  Goddamn.
[43:29.260 --> 43:29.900]  Hey, Gavin.
[43:30.220 --> 43:31.140]  Didn't you just say go?
[43:31.720 --> 43:32.460]  Gavin, any thoughts?
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.180]  Nobody said anything.
[43:33.360 --> 43:34.320]  Gavin, any thoughts on what just happened?
[43:34.720 --> 43:36.540]  I thought you said we're jumping on the barrel.
[43:37.180 --> 43:37.660]  Uh-huh.
[43:37.780 --> 43:38.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:38.420 --> 43:39.240]  And so you just...
[43:39.240 --> 43:41.600]  And then as the guy in the middle of the chain, you just did it?
[43:43.880 --> 43:44.520]  Is that...
[43:44.520 --> 43:45.700]  Is that what happened?
[43:45.860 --> 43:46.640]  I'm really freaking out.
[43:46.660 --> 43:47.080]  I'm just curious.
[43:47.240 --> 43:47.640]  I'm just asking.
[43:48.160 --> 43:48.800]  Grab Eric.
[43:49.100 --> 43:50.180]  You gotta pull Eric.
[43:51.760 --> 43:52.280]  Alright, we're good.
[43:52.560 --> 43:53.560]  Am I trying the rope?
[43:53.920 --> 43:54.740]  Nick, are you gonna try?
[43:56.100 --> 43:56.940]  Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
[43:57.060 --> 43:57.380]  Okay, ready?
[43:57.460 --> 43:58.240]  Wait, who's next to Nick?
[43:58.320 --> 43:59.060]  They might both have to...
[43:59.060 --> 43:59.540]  Didn't work.
[43:59.820 --> 44:00.080]  Nope.
[44:00.400 --> 44:01.900]  Alright, well, you've pulled me off.
[44:03.680 --> 44:04.220]  Well, look.
[44:04.300 --> 44:04.940]  We had to know.
[44:05.480 --> 44:05.880]  And...
[44:06.580 --> 44:06.980]  And...
[44:06.980 --> 44:07.220]  Up.
[44:07.860 --> 44:11.260]  Guys, you gotta pull me while I pull him or I slide off.
[44:11.260 --> 44:12.700]  Do we all have to be pulling all the time?
[44:12.820 --> 44:14.300]  No, you just have to pull Geoff.
[44:14.440 --> 44:16.000]  Oh my god, Gavin.
[44:17.840 --> 44:18.240]  Don't...
[44:18.240 --> 44:19.980]  Gavin, do not touch a thing right now.
[44:20.400 --> 44:21.320]  Not touching shit.
[44:22.320 --> 44:23.040]  Let Eric...
[44:23.040 --> 44:23.200]  I'm pulling.
[44:25.080 --> 44:26.040]  Swing the other way.
[44:26.080 --> 44:26.600]  I'm pulling.
[44:26.720 --> 44:26.840]  Okay.
[44:27.560 --> 44:28.060]  I'm pulling.
[44:28.420 --> 44:29.540]  Gavin, you don't know how to get him up.
[44:29.540 --> 44:31.220]  Can you maneuver yourself slightly, Gav?
[44:33.920 --> 44:35.340]  Are you coming up at all, Gavin?
[44:36.320 --> 44:37.020]  Not really.
[44:37.120 --> 44:37.940]  I'm gonna try and like...
[44:39.000 --> 44:39.400]  Yes.
[44:40.000 --> 44:40.320]  There.
[44:40.760 --> 44:40.960]  Okay.
[44:42.360 --> 44:43.140]  I'm in the barrel.
[44:43.140 --> 44:43.560]  Are you moving?
[44:43.660 --> 44:44.340]  Are you coming up or no?
[44:44.360 --> 44:45.200]  Doesn't look like it.
[44:46.220 --> 44:48.320]  If I go back, do I pull you down?
[44:48.800 --> 44:49.020]  Yes.
[44:49.020 --> 44:49.420]  What if I pull?
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.020]  Don't pull.
[44:51.120 --> 44:51.400]  Why?
[44:51.580 --> 44:52.920]  Why would you do that?
[44:52.960 --> 44:54.380]  You would kill all of us.
[44:54.400 --> 44:55.300]  What if I pull?
[44:56.260 --> 44:57.620]  Let's try a different side of the barrel.
[44:57.940 --> 45:01.700]  Does it make sense to maybe have you guys swing to the left?
[45:01.700 --> 45:03.700]  That's what I was looking at.
[45:03.880 --> 45:04.500]  Oh, yeah.
[45:04.600 --> 45:05.240]  What if we could do that?
[45:06.700 --> 45:06.840]  Oh.
[45:07.120 --> 45:07.560]  No, no, no.
[45:07.560 --> 45:07.800]  Stop.
[45:08.120 --> 45:08.960]  Stop, stop, stop.
[45:09.160 --> 45:09.840]  You're jangling the shit out of me.
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.200]  I stopped.
[45:10.280 --> 45:10.620]  I stopped.
[45:10.720 --> 45:11.060]  I stopped.
[45:11.140 --> 45:11.460]  I stopped.
[45:11.700 --> 45:12.540]  All right, Eric, keep pulling.
[45:13.440 --> 45:13.740]  I'm...
[45:13.740 --> 45:15.480]  Andrew, you can see I'm pulling, right?
[45:15.540 --> 45:17.220]  He is pulling full speed.
[45:18.580 --> 45:22.700]  What if I try just pressing up and doing some wiggles?
[45:24.340 --> 45:25.400]  Is this anything for you?
[45:29.860 --> 45:30.500]  All right.
[45:31.180 --> 45:33.400]  What if I pull up Geoff?
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.340]  Try that.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.380]  You just have to look down at him.
[45:37.640 --> 45:38.300]  I don't think you can.
[45:38.800 --> 45:39.300]  Wait, hang on.
[45:39.340 --> 45:40.620]  So you're on the barrel?
[45:41.120 --> 45:41.520]  Yeah, I'm up.
[45:41.680 --> 45:42.100]  Well, there we go.
[45:42.160 --> 45:42.580]  I got me up.
[45:43.480 --> 45:43.920]  I just pulled.
[45:43.920 --> 45:44.840]  I'm holding on to you still.
[45:46.000 --> 45:46.180]  Okay.
[45:46.960 --> 45:47.280]  Nice.
[45:47.840 --> 45:48.140]  No!
[45:49.200 --> 45:49.700]  Oh, no.
[45:50.200 --> 45:50.460]  Oh, no.
[45:50.560 --> 45:51.000]  It's fine, just keep pulling.
[45:51.120 --> 45:51.500]  Keep pulling.
[45:51.860 --> 45:52.300]  Just keep pulling.
[45:54.840 --> 46:00.480]  Oh, my God.
[46:00.520 --> 46:01.280]  Andrew, any thoughts?
[46:02.280 --> 46:02.600]  Andrew?
[46:02.600 --> 46:03.140]  Yeah.
[46:03.140 --> 46:03.420]  Anything?
[46:04.380 --> 46:04.940]  Yeah, anything?
[46:05.400 --> 46:05.840]  No.
[46:06.340 --> 46:06.780]  All right, I'm up.
[46:06.780 --> 46:09.700]  It helps if I pull Geoff to get up.
[46:09.880 --> 46:11.420]  Stop pulling me off!
[46:11.980 --> 46:12.700]  God damn.
[46:13.220 --> 46:14.900]  The second I'm off, I get yanked off.
[46:15.560 --> 46:16.880]  I am just hanging.
[46:18.700 --> 46:21.640]  Oh, for fuck's sake.
[46:24.920 --> 46:26.280]  I don't want to get pulled up.
[46:26.340 --> 46:28.700]  The second I get pulled up, I'm going to get yanked off.
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.220]  How does it feel to watch this and not play?
[46:32.220 --> 46:33.200]  Is it good?
[46:33.220 --> 46:33.960]  It's so good.
[46:34.500 --> 46:34.780]  All right.
[46:35.160 --> 46:36.820]  I'm having such a good time.
[46:37.120 --> 46:37.880]  Geoff, grab.
[46:38.320 --> 46:38.740]  All right, I'm up.
[46:38.760 --> 46:39.560]  And then stay.
[46:40.320 --> 46:42.220]  I'm going to try to stay, but fuck, it's hard.
[46:42.280 --> 46:43.080]  I can't pull Eric.
[46:43.200 --> 46:44.180]  I can't try to pull Nick up.
[46:44.200 --> 46:45.180]  Don't pull Eric, pull Nick.
[46:45.260 --> 46:46.900]  Well, yeah, you need to walk over to where we are.
[46:47.300 --> 46:49.340]  I can't, it just fucking yanks me off.
[46:49.520 --> 46:51.980]  I don't know why, you're just like, you're like hanging out on like the edge.
[46:52.120 --> 46:53.020]  It's not on my screen.
[46:53.180 --> 46:54.360]  On my screen, I'm in the middle of the barrel.
[46:55.540 --> 46:56.500]  All right, now pull up, Nick.
[46:56.500 --> 46:59.960]  On my screen, I'm in the middle of the barrel, and I just started getting yanked.
[47:01.180 --> 47:03.540]  It's sliding me all over the goddamn thing.
[47:03.640 --> 47:04.700]  Is he getting pulled up at all?
[47:05.180 --> 47:05.380]  No.
[47:05.660 --> 47:06.500]  Ah, fuck!
[47:08.040 --> 47:09.760]  I can't do it.
[47:09.800 --> 47:12.260]  I think you need to keep pulling Geoff while he pulls me.
[47:13.080 --> 47:13.600]  We are.
[47:13.720 --> 47:13.980]  Okay.
[47:14.360 --> 47:15.420]  I'm almost there.
[47:15.600 --> 47:16.000]  We're pulling.
[47:16.660 --> 47:17.280]  Everyone's pulling.
[47:18.000 --> 47:18.980]  I'm almost there.
[47:19.260 --> 47:19.660]  Ah!
[47:19.840 --> 47:20.200]  Yes!
[47:20.500 --> 47:20.540]  All right.
[47:21.080 --> 47:23.060]  Now we got Geoff.
[47:23.320 --> 47:23.640]  Okay.
[47:24.220 --> 47:24.780]  Okay.
[47:25.260 --> 47:25.760]  Good job.
[47:26.080 --> 47:27.020]  One barrel down.
[47:28.000 --> 47:28.560]  Okay.
[47:28.560 --> 47:30.040]  All right.
[47:30.040 --> 47:32.220]  We're gonna make a jump to this barrel.
[47:32.360 --> 47:33.360]  We're gonna do it together.
[47:33.540 --> 47:33.860]  Okay.
[47:34.660 --> 47:35.460]  On go.
[47:35.780 --> 47:36.800]  On go.
[47:36.960 --> 47:38.240]  So it's gonna be three, two, one, go.
[47:38.340 --> 47:39.340]  I'm gonna call it out.
[47:39.400 --> 47:39.700]  Okay.
[47:40.700 --> 47:41.180]  Okay.
[47:41.560 --> 47:41.800]  Ready.
[47:42.040 --> 47:43.900]  Three, two, one, go.
[47:45.380 --> 47:45.840]  Okay.
[47:46.000 --> 47:46.200]  Perfect.
[47:47.020 --> 47:47.200]  Okay.
[47:47.500 --> 47:49.460]  Now, we're gonna jump over to that edge together.
[47:49.780 --> 47:50.360]  On go.
[47:50.760 --> 47:52.880]  Three, two, one, go.
[47:53.640 --> 47:54.060]  Okay.
[47:54.480 --> 47:55.020]  There we go.
[47:55.400 --> 47:55.700]  Easy.
[47:56.000 --> 47:56.280]  Easy.
[47:56.280 --> 47:56.820]  Wow.
[47:56.820 --> 47:58.080]  Anything in the shack?
[47:58.180 --> 48:00.740]  We got food or a sandwich or somewhere to, like, lay down?
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.900]  One of these shacks is certainly gonna kill us.
[48:03.460 --> 48:03.600]  Yeah.
[48:03.820 --> 48:04.360]  Yeah, definitely.
[48:05.840 --> 48:06.640]  Ladder over here.
[48:06.720 --> 48:07.260]  Ladder over here.
[48:07.980 --> 48:08.840]  Where's that?
[48:08.960 --> 48:09.800]  Oh, good eye, Nick.
[48:10.000 --> 48:10.240]  Thank you.
[48:10.480 --> 48:10.620]  Ah!
[48:11.560 --> 48:11.920]  Okay.
[48:12.160 --> 48:14.680]  Gavin is just climbing everything he sees.
[48:15.040 --> 48:15.180]  That's fine.
[48:15.180 --> 48:16.220]  Just laying on a torch.
[48:17.900 --> 48:18.340]  Okay.
[48:18.360 --> 48:21.040]  Gavin is climbing up the backside of the ladder.
[48:24.080 --> 48:24.520]  You...
[48:24.520 --> 48:25.280]  I'm gonna...
[48:25.280 --> 48:27.620]  I'm going to send you to hell for real.
[48:28.900 --> 48:29.560]  Immunity bullet.
[48:31.380 --> 48:31.680]  Okay.
[48:31.920 --> 48:32.100]  Good.
[48:32.300 --> 48:32.780]  I don't...
[48:32.780 --> 48:35.120]  Hey, Nick, I don't need the immunity.
[48:36.860 --> 48:37.660]  I accept...
[48:37.660 --> 48:38.980]  I accept my punishment.
[48:40.480 --> 48:40.880]  Okay.
[48:41.160 --> 48:41.740]  What's this about?
[48:42.260 --> 48:43.380]  That's a jumpy, isn't it?
[48:43.480 --> 48:43.700]  Jumper.
[48:43.940 --> 48:45.620]  So, we're gonna have to jump it on the...
[48:45.620 --> 48:47.260]  I say we follow it as far...
[48:47.260 --> 48:48.280]  Like, right when it leaves...
[48:48.280 --> 48:49.620]  As far out as we can go.
[48:49.680 --> 48:50.380]  And then we'll jump with it once.
[48:50.380 --> 48:51.280]  But we have to go together, right?
[48:51.280 --> 48:52.040]  Yeah, we have to go together.
[48:52.880 --> 48:53.700]  Get inside each other.
[48:53.720 --> 48:54.060]  Who's gonna call it out?
[48:54.060 --> 48:54.620]  I will.
[48:54.920 --> 48:55.160]  It's always Nick.
[48:55.180 --> 48:56.120]  Who's gonna call the go?
[48:56.340 --> 48:56.920]  I'll call go.
[48:57.860 --> 48:58.140]  Okay.
[48:58.300 --> 48:58.700]  On this one.
[48:59.900 --> 49:00.060]  Go!
[49:03.190 --> 49:03.630]  Hell yeah.
[49:04.710 --> 49:05.790]  Good job, boys!
[49:06.510 --> 49:07.270]  Way to go.
[49:07.870 --> 49:08.510]  Oh, we got a tramp.
[49:08.710 --> 49:09.630]  Where's that tramp in us to?
[49:09.670 --> 49:10.130]  The next one.
[49:10.290 --> 49:10.430]  Okay.
[49:11.330 --> 49:12.710]  I don't think that's a jump, isn't it?
[49:12.770 --> 49:13.570]  I don't know that we can get there.
[49:13.570 --> 49:14.390]  Yeah, it really is.
[49:14.490 --> 49:15.650]  I think we have to do it all together.
[49:16.330 --> 49:16.610]  Uh...
[49:16.610 --> 49:17.890]  Do you think we can win this trampoline?
[49:18.450 --> 49:18.690]  Hang on.
[49:18.710 --> 49:19.690]  It might be a sprint jump.
[49:20.050 --> 49:20.470]  Yeah, I think it is.
[49:20.470 --> 49:20.970]  Can you practice that?
[49:20.990 --> 49:22.150]  I think it is.
[49:22.230 --> 49:22.790]  I think it is.
[49:22.790 --> 49:25.150]  Oh, you guys haven't practiced sprinting the other way.
[49:27.110 --> 49:27.470]  Alright.
[49:27.790 --> 49:28.870]  Yeah, that'll be it.
[49:29.210 --> 49:29.670]  We got it.
[49:29.710 --> 49:29.890]  Okay.
[49:30.350 --> 49:31.010]  I'll get in the same line.
[49:31.850 --> 49:32.830]  We're gonna start from here.
[49:33.470 --> 49:34.510]  Everyone mob on me.
[49:35.130 --> 49:36.790]  I'm gonna call out the go.
[49:36.930 --> 49:39.050]  On go, and then just get as far as you can and jump.
[49:39.210 --> 49:40.870]  You guys are gonna fuck this up, and I can't wait.
[49:42.430 --> 49:44.250]  Three, two, one, go!
[49:46.010 --> 49:46.270]  Okay.
[49:47.110 --> 49:48.530]  Why didn't you wait?
[49:50.890 --> 49:51.250]  Okay.
[49:51.250 --> 49:51.550]  Oh, yeah.
[49:51.770 --> 49:52.010]  God!
[49:52.350 --> 49:53.370]  Pull me up!
[49:53.910 --> 49:54.270]  Pull me up!
[49:54.510 --> 49:54.690]  Pull!
[49:55.030 --> 49:55.810]  There we go.
[49:56.310 --> 49:56.710]  What?
[49:57.110 --> 49:57.830]  Jump and hold?
[49:57.970 --> 49:58.430]  What does that say?
[49:59.190 --> 50:00.270]  It said jump and hold?
[50:00.530 --> 50:00.710]  Jump?
[50:01.170 --> 50:02.070]  Is that what it was?
[50:02.610 --> 50:02.990]  Hang on.
[50:03.190 --> 50:03.490]  Hang on.
[50:03.530 --> 50:03.710]  Hang on.
[50:03.730 --> 50:04.130]  Wait, wait, wait!
[50:04.190 --> 50:06.010]  Everyone stop fucking jumping!
[50:06.250 --> 50:06.390]  I did it.
[50:06.470 --> 50:07.070]  I just had it.
[50:07.090 --> 50:07.390]  Stop!
[50:07.590 --> 50:08.610]  Oh, it's leaving us!
[50:09.790 --> 50:10.190]  Nick!
[50:10.330 --> 50:10.490]  What?
[50:11.830 --> 50:15.930]  I think that one of us has to try to jump and hang on.
[50:16.090 --> 50:16.310]  Uh-huh.
[50:18.010 --> 50:22.070]  Do we all try it together, or should it just be one of us?
[50:22.310 --> 50:22.730]  It's gotta be all of us, right?
[50:22.730 --> 50:23.510]  What did you do to do that?
[50:23.510 --> 50:24.730]  You just held the jump button?
[50:24.890 --> 50:26.130]  Yeah, I just jumped up to it and held jump.
[50:26.330 --> 50:28.090]  And then I let go and Eric started yelling at everybody.
[50:28.110 --> 50:28.330]  All right.
[50:28.630 --> 50:30.270]  On go, we're all gonna do it.
[50:30.370 --> 50:30.550]  Ready?
[50:30.750 --> 50:30.950]  Yeah.
[50:31.850 --> 50:33.870]  Three, two, one, go!
[50:34.750 --> 50:35.250]  Got it.
[50:35.550 --> 50:36.350]  Did not grab it.
[50:36.390 --> 50:36.610]  I'm on it.
[50:36.650 --> 50:37.490]  Did not grab it.
[50:37.590 --> 50:37.890]  Why?
[50:38.270 --> 50:38.630]  Why?
[50:39.130 --> 50:39.870]  Why did only...
[50:39.870 --> 50:40.350]  Oh, my God.
[50:40.350 --> 50:40.710]  It's all right.
[50:41.230 --> 50:42.530]  Don't let go, Gavin.
[50:42.810 --> 50:43.750]  It's me and Gavin.
[50:43.750 --> 50:45.350]  Yeah, Gavin, I'm on it.
[50:45.410 --> 50:46.330]  My thumb is slipping all over the space bar.
[50:46.930 --> 50:47.570]  Oh, my God.
[50:47.710 --> 50:49.570]  I'm inside of Geoff, and Geoff's inside of me.
[50:49.710 --> 50:49.910]  I'm so sweaty.
[50:50.370 --> 50:51.810]  So sweaty.
[50:52.470 --> 50:53.770]  Do not let go.
[50:55.150 --> 50:56.270]  Don't let go.
[50:56.670 --> 50:57.350]  Where are we going?
[50:57.470 --> 50:58.250]  Do we have to time this?
[50:58.290 --> 50:58.990]  Hang on.
[50:59.270 --> 50:59.830]  We're going up.
[50:59.970 --> 51:00.510]  We're going up.
[51:00.570 --> 51:00.950]  We're going up.
[51:00.990 --> 51:01.310]  We're good.
[51:01.390 --> 51:01.690]  We're good.
[51:01.790 --> 51:02.110]  We're good.
[51:02.690 --> 51:03.190]  Oh, this is gonna be great.
[51:03.190 --> 51:05.110]  Eric's telling us to hang on like we'll do anything at all.
[51:05.130 --> 51:06.190]  Like I'm gonna let go.
[51:06.370 --> 51:08.230]  Dude, if I don't say it, I don't know what the fuck's gonna happen.
[51:08.230 --> 51:09.190]  There's a chunk!
[51:10.210 --> 51:10.550]  All right.
[51:11.110 --> 51:11.430]  All right.
[51:11.570 --> 51:12.330]  And let go.
[51:12.330 --> 51:12.890]  Let go.
[51:13.190 --> 51:13.530]  Oh!
[51:15.110 --> 51:15.790]  Easy peasy.
[51:16.210 --> 51:16.790]  The car race.
[51:17.390 --> 51:17.830]  No!
[51:18.770 --> 51:19.650]  Oh, it's trucks.
[51:20.230 --> 51:21.410]  We saved our progress?
[51:23.690 --> 51:24.570]  I'm driving.
[51:25.470 --> 51:27.490]  No, why would you be the one to drive?
[51:28.570 --> 51:31.250]  Guys, we hit a checkpoint or something.
[51:31.390 --> 51:31.750]  We did?
[51:31.990 --> 51:32.650]  Did we?
[51:32.810 --> 51:33.950]  I think that's what happened.
[51:34.730 --> 51:36.490]  Oh, I hate driving so much.
[51:36.590 --> 51:36.970]  Oh, good.
[51:37.510 --> 51:38.230]  Someone else do it?
[51:38.630 --> 51:39.830]  No, you got it.
[51:40.130 --> 51:40.290]  Go.
[51:41.290 --> 51:44.030]  Yeah, just pretend you're Nico Bellet.
[51:44.550 --> 51:44.950]  Yeah.
[51:46.210 --> 51:47.190]  Hey, cousin!
[51:48.070 --> 51:48.870]  Just be careful, careful.
[51:49.090 --> 51:50.170]  The end of Halo 3.
[51:50.530 --> 51:51.270]  You got this.
[51:52.890 --> 51:54.370]  And he drove straight into it.
[51:56.750 --> 51:57.790]  Watch out for the rocks.
[51:57.910 --> 51:59.190]  You're good, you're good, you're good.
[51:59.390 --> 52:00.290]  Gavin, you're doing great.
[52:00.370 --> 52:02.430]  Gavin, you're fucking killing this right now, bud.
[52:02.870 --> 52:03.910]  You're doing so good.
[52:03.970 --> 52:04.930]  I'm so proud of you, man.
[52:04.970 --> 52:05.490]  This is baby.
[52:05.490 --> 52:06.370]  You're doing so good.
[52:06.470 --> 52:07.530]  This is baby stuff.
[52:07.770 --> 52:08.930]  Oh, that was...
[52:08.930 --> 52:09.410]  Could've been better.
[52:11.250 --> 52:11.790]  Good job.
[52:11.850 --> 52:12.790]  There you go.
[52:14.370 --> 52:14.730]  Okay.
[52:15.610 --> 52:16.570]  Here's what I'm thinking.
[52:16.790 --> 52:17.390]  Grab this.
[52:19.150 --> 52:20.090]  We have it.
[52:20.810 --> 52:23.010]  We have it as far as we're gonna go right now.
[52:23.330 --> 52:25.590]  Let's go until we fall, and that'll be the end of the video.
[52:25.750 --> 52:25.790]  Okay.
[52:26.030 --> 52:28.330]  Do we have to stand on this or hold the side of this?
[52:28.810 --> 52:30.410]  I think it's Super Mario Sunshine.
[52:30.570 --> 52:31.430]  I think you gotta ride it.
[52:32.050 --> 52:32.630]  Yeah, but...
[52:32.630 --> 52:32.950]  I think so, too.
[52:33.250 --> 52:34.570]  Alright, let's memorize the pattern, then.
[52:34.810 --> 52:35.390]  Oh, God.
[52:35.530 --> 52:37.030]  Okay, so it goes up at the...
[52:37.030 --> 52:38.290]  So, we're gonna see it on the way back.
[52:38.430 --> 52:39.110]  It's up, up.
[52:39.110 --> 52:39.430]  Okay.
[52:39.810 --> 52:40.830]  Unless you were up, up.
[52:40.870 --> 52:42.690]  Well, it'll be forwards, backwards, left, and right, won't it?
[52:43.510 --> 52:43.770]  Yeah.
[52:44.790 --> 52:45.430]  So, let's...
[52:45.430 --> 52:48.510]  When it comes back here, let's watch the directions that we'll need to move.
[52:48.530 --> 52:48.830]  Oh, it's different.
[52:49.050 --> 52:49.490]  It's different.
[52:49.710 --> 52:50.230]  Oh, it's different.
[52:50.490 --> 52:50.810]  Okay.
[52:51.010 --> 52:51.330]  Never mind.
[52:52.430 --> 52:52.750]  Well...
[52:54.050 --> 52:55.210]  Let's just give it a shot.
[52:55.210 --> 52:55.390]  Here we go.
[52:55.590 --> 52:56.030]  You guys ready?
[52:56.510 --> 52:56.750]  Nope.
[52:56.750 --> 52:57.270]  Yeah, totally.
[52:57.310 --> 52:57.830]  Let's do it.
[52:57.970 --> 52:58.370]  You guys ready?
[52:58.450 --> 52:58.630]  Yeah.
[52:58.790 --> 52:59.430]  Okay, let's do it.
[53:00.690 --> 53:01.210]  I'm on it.
[53:01.350 --> 53:02.630]  You cannot grab onto the cage.
[53:02.690 --> 53:03.170]  It's good to know.
[53:03.330 --> 53:04.770]  No, you just have to run opposite.
[53:06.270 --> 53:06.870]  Not a problem.
[53:06.870 --> 53:07.090]  All right.
[53:09.310 --> 53:10.110]  Got it.
[53:12.850 --> 53:13.830]  Don't jump, just run.
[53:15.290 --> 53:16.030]  Now we jump.
[53:16.330 --> 53:17.190]  Go, go, go, go.
[53:17.190 --> 53:17.230]  Hang on, hang on.
[53:17.910 --> 53:18.710]  Okay, there we go.
[53:19.690 --> 53:19.930]  Ooh.
[53:20.290 --> 53:22.190]  Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[53:22.390 --> 53:23.970]  Everyone's just hitting the jump button.
[53:24.110 --> 53:24.830]  Everyone's going crazy.
[53:25.130 --> 53:26.250]  Let's chill for a second.
[53:27.750 --> 53:28.970]  We gotta climb the screw.
[53:29.090 --> 53:29.550]  Okay, ready?
[53:30.170 --> 53:30.790]  We're getting up here.
[53:32.150 --> 53:32.650]  There we go.
[53:34.110 --> 53:34.710]  Gavin, need a hand?
[53:34.890 --> 53:35.190]  Yeah.
[53:37.790 --> 53:38.310]  I'm trying.
[53:38.510 --> 53:39.250]  Stop swinging.
[53:39.410 --> 53:39.750]  Here we go.
[53:40.170 --> 53:40.930]  Why can't I pull?
[53:41.510 --> 53:41.830]  Thank you.
[53:42.010 --> 53:42.350]  There we go.
[53:42.750 --> 53:43.150]  Okay.
[53:43.890 --> 53:45.350]  All right, here comes the next one.
[53:45.770 --> 53:47.290]  Man, I always hated Whomp's Fortress.
[53:49.450 --> 53:51.410]  I'm sweating so fucking bad.
[53:53.390 --> 53:54.490]  All right, Gavin.
[53:54.690 --> 53:55.970]  I'll pull you up again, I guess.
[53:56.030 --> 53:57.050]  Gavin, I don't understand.
[53:57.450 --> 53:59.370]  For some reason, having a real hard time with just a vertical jump.
[53:59.370 --> 53:59.590]  Yeah.
[53:59.610 --> 54:00.270]  Just a vertical jump.
[54:00.290 --> 54:01.190]  What am I doing wrong?
[54:02.290 --> 54:02.930]  Gavin, wait.
[54:03.190 --> 54:03.570]  Hey, man.
[54:03.790 --> 54:04.330]  I don't know.
[54:04.950 --> 54:05.750]  I'm not sure.
[54:05.750 --> 54:06.530]  You'll get it this time.
[54:07.150 --> 54:07.910]  You'll get it this time.
[54:07.930 --> 54:08.570]  It's not working.
[54:09.430 --> 54:10.390]  You got it right here.
[54:10.450 --> 54:11.350]  I believe in you, Gavin.
[54:11.430 --> 54:12.290]  All right, here we go.
[54:13.870 --> 54:14.190]  Gavin.
[54:14.390 --> 54:15.170]  All right, Gavin.
[54:15.170 --> 54:18.330]  I'm going to pull you up for the third fucking time.
[54:18.390 --> 54:19.130]  Here you go.
[54:19.350 --> 54:20.410]  Yeah, just nice and easy.
[54:20.450 --> 54:20.690]  All right.
[54:20.750 --> 54:21.770]  No problem, dude.
[54:22.170 --> 54:22.650]  No problem.
[54:22.670 --> 54:22.890]  All right.
[54:23.010 --> 54:24.950]  Okay, Gavin, I believe in you this time.
[54:25.210 --> 54:25.490]  You ready?
[54:26.650 --> 54:27.530]  All right, that was my bad this time.
[54:27.530 --> 54:27.990]  All right, Gavin.
[54:28.090 --> 54:29.370]  I'm going to go ahead and pull you up.
[54:29.690 --> 54:31.810]  Gavin, I'm going to go ahead and pull you up for a fourth time.
[54:33.630 --> 54:38.010]  Every time we just had to make the easy vertical jump, you decided, I don't want to do that.
[54:38.050 --> 54:40.250]  I just can't do that.
[54:40.590 --> 54:41.050]  Oh, look.
[54:41.050 --> 54:41.650]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[54:42.410 --> 54:43.290]  Not really clear on...
[54:44.730 --> 54:45.170]  Okay.
[54:45.750 --> 54:46.450]  Okay, hang on.
[54:46.470 --> 54:46.790]  Wait!
[54:46.990 --> 54:49.470]  That was insane by you, dude.
[54:49.490 --> 54:51.550]  Why did you just try that?
[54:52.010 --> 54:55.670]  If I could push you off this thing and it wouldn't hurt us, I'd do it.
[54:55.770 --> 54:57.370]  Well, it would, so fuck you.
[54:57.750 --> 54:58.010]  Anyway.
[55:00.530 --> 55:02.270]  Let's take a moment to look straight up.
[55:02.630 --> 55:02.970]  Yeah.
[55:02.990 --> 55:04.290]  Oh, my God.
[55:04.690 --> 55:05.350]  Oh, dear.
[55:06.330 --> 55:06.570]  Okay.
[55:06.790 --> 55:07.210]  All right.
[55:07.530 --> 55:08.590]  Okay, here's what I'm thinking.
[55:08.730 --> 55:11.690]  We need to go in a line, like in a sequence.
[55:11.690 --> 55:12.050]  Okay.
[55:12.070 --> 55:15.970]  We can all go together, but I don't think we should.
[55:16.130 --> 55:16.270]  Okay.
[55:16.310 --> 55:17.830]  I think, of course, we should.
[55:17.910 --> 55:18.390]  Are you crazy?
[55:18.710 --> 55:19.030]  Of course, we should.
[55:19.230 --> 55:20.170]  You want to go together?
[55:20.290 --> 55:22.130]  Yeah, I think it's too long.
[55:22.630 --> 55:23.850]  It's a long gap.
[55:24.430 --> 55:26.390]  I mean, at least that first jump, but you all have to be together.
[55:26.690 --> 55:27.790]  Okay, who wants to call it?
[55:27.790 --> 55:28.290]  Nick.
[55:28.390 --> 55:28.870]  I'll do it.
[55:28.870 --> 55:31.050]  And then we're going to stop on.
[55:31.150 --> 55:31.970]  There's another group of four.
[55:32.010 --> 55:32.850]  We're going to stop on it.
[55:32.950 --> 55:33.070]  Help.
[55:33.490 --> 55:33.750]  All right.
[55:33.970 --> 55:34.910]  Okay, we're going to stop on it.
[55:35.090 --> 55:36.210]  Have you considered that it'll break?
[55:36.910 --> 55:37.630]  Oh, am I?
[55:37.810 --> 55:38.490]  We'll find out.
[55:39.110 --> 55:39.510]  You ready?
[55:40.570 --> 55:41.870]  Three, two, one, go.
[55:41.870 --> 55:42.890]  Who is going to call it out?
[55:43.810 --> 55:43.990]  Okay.
[55:44.090 --> 55:44.630]  What do you mean?
[55:46.030 --> 55:46.390]  Okay.
[55:46.550 --> 55:46.770]  All right.
[55:47.050 --> 55:48.030]  Three, two, one, go.
[55:50.250 --> 55:50.410]  Up.
[55:50.910 --> 55:51.590]  Oh, I fell.
[55:51.870 --> 55:52.010]  Yeah.
[55:52.270 --> 55:52.930]  Oh, I fell.
[55:52.990 --> 55:53.390]  Oh, God.
[55:53.650 --> 55:54.050]  Oh, God.
[55:54.130 --> 55:54.470]  Oh, God.
[55:54.470 --> 55:54.850]  Hold it, hold it.
[55:54.870 --> 55:55.810]  Holding, holding, holding.
[55:56.190 --> 55:56.330]  All right, you got this, Nick.
[55:56.410 --> 55:57.110]  Just pull me up.
[55:57.210 --> 55:58.090]  You just pull me up.
[55:59.270 --> 56:00.090]  Pull me up.
[56:00.450 --> 56:00.870]  Pulling Geoff.
[56:01.610 --> 56:02.150]  Pulling Geoff.
[56:02.730 --> 56:03.070]  Pulling Geoff.
[56:03.090 --> 56:05.850]  Well, at least if you fall the way Eric is.
[56:05.970 --> 56:07.330]  Don't, don't even say it.
[56:07.570 --> 56:08.410]  Don't, don't.
[56:08.570 --> 56:10.670]  Why the fuck would you jinx it right now, bud?
[56:10.710 --> 56:11.310]  All right, you got to pull.
[56:11.410 --> 56:12.850]  You got to pull, Nick, so I can pull.
[56:13.330 --> 56:13.670]  I'm pulling.
[56:13.790 --> 56:14.470]  Oh, fuck.
[56:15.610 --> 56:15.970]  Geoff.
[56:16.370 --> 56:17.630]  Well, I'm alive.
[56:17.770 --> 56:18.110]  Bring me over.
[56:18.210 --> 56:19.050]  All right, I'm over at the next one.
[56:19.050 --> 56:19.850]  Oh, yeah, that worked.
[56:20.630 --> 56:21.150]  Never mind.
[56:24.470 --> 56:26.210]  All right, Nick, now you jump to the next one.
[56:26.630 --> 56:27.110]  All right.
[56:27.610 --> 56:28.770]  Let's just swing him along.
[56:29.090 --> 56:29.230]  What?
[56:29.230 --> 56:29.830]  What are you doing?
[56:29.910 --> 56:30.470]  Well, we're dead.
[56:30.830 --> 56:31.430]  Oh, no, that didn't work.
[56:31.710 --> 56:32.210]  Grab the rope.
[56:32.210 --> 56:32.710]  No, we're not, no, we're not.
[56:32.790 --> 56:33.250]  Grab it.
[56:33.350 --> 56:33.730]  Grab the rope.
[56:34.070 --> 56:35.270]  Yeah, you got it.
[56:36.670 --> 56:36.990]  Whoa.
[56:37.870 --> 56:38.550]  Oh, yeah.
[56:39.990 --> 56:41.050]  What a recovery.
[56:41.730 --> 56:42.570]  We've got no car.
[56:42.670 --> 56:43.110]  Let's go and get it.
[56:43.110 --> 56:43.470]  From who?
[56:43.730 --> 56:44.990]  Who made, who made the recovery?
[56:45.290 --> 56:45.990]  Who made that recovery?
[56:46.970 --> 56:48.070]  Looks like Eric to me.
[56:48.890 --> 56:50.210]  Thank you so much, guys.
[56:50.210 --> 56:54.910]  Guys, thanks for watching this video where I'm in an actual hell of our own creation.
[56:55.130 --> 56:56.130]  We've got to keep going.
[56:56.350 --> 56:57.170]  We didn't create this.
[56:57.390 --> 56:58.650]  It's, no, no, I can't.
[56:58.650 --> 57:00.550]  Why are you going this way with cars down there?
[57:01.590 --> 57:03.470]  Because we can't, I don't think it's blocked.
[57:03.770 --> 57:07.730]  Why don't we, why don't we stop here and keep playing and do another one?
[57:08.370 --> 57:09.730]  I don't want to keep playing.
[57:09.870 --> 57:10.110]  Why not?
[57:10.190 --> 57:12.410]  I never want to see this game again for as long as I live.
[57:12.450 --> 57:13.250]  It's a one-er.
[57:13.330 --> 57:14.490]  We can't just stop halfway.
[57:14.570 --> 57:16.530]  We need to fall or we need to, you know.
[57:17.290 --> 57:18.630]  Oh, we just fell.
[57:19.790 --> 57:20.590]  Who's driving?
[57:21.110 --> 57:22.250]  Well, it didn't let us.
[57:23.090 --> 57:23.670]  What happened?
[57:23.890 --> 57:24.810]  Someone was driving.
[57:24.990 --> 57:25.230]  There we go.
[57:25.630 --> 57:26.110]  Who's driving?
[57:26.610 --> 57:26.850]  Me.
[57:27.130 --> 57:27.570]  Geoff.
[57:27.930 --> 57:28.590]  Oh, boy.
[57:28.730 --> 57:29.710]  Hit that ramp.
[57:29.830 --> 57:31.210]  Hit the ramp, hit the ramp, hit the ramp, hit the ramp.
[57:31.450 --> 57:31.710]  Yeah.
[57:38.090 --> 57:39.970]  Get out on the highway.
[57:41.510 --> 57:43.030]  Looking for some holes.
[57:43.270 --> 57:45.950]  I see why Gavin hated this so much.
[57:46.550 --> 57:48.130]  It's not great.
[57:48.130 --> 57:49.230]  It's a dude-er.
[57:49.390 --> 57:49.970]  Hit that jump.
[57:50.190 --> 57:51.170]  I'm going to jump that ramp.
[57:52.210 --> 57:53.250]  There you go, buddy.
[57:54.230 --> 57:56.110]  How are the physics compared to GTA 4?
[57:56.910 --> 57:57.450]  Still better.
[57:57.690 --> 57:59.030]  Still better than GTA 4.
[57:59.770 --> 58:00.550]  Holy shit.
[58:06.150 --> 58:06.630]  Nice.
[58:07.110 --> 58:08.170]  Okay, you're back to sunshine.
[58:09.930 --> 58:10.590]  Alright, back to this.
[58:10.590 --> 58:11.250]  And this is easy.
[58:11.630 --> 58:12.190]  Easy peasy.
[58:14.650 --> 58:16.410]  Oh, we got one more fortress to get.
[58:17.050 --> 58:17.450]  Oh, shit.
[58:18.230 --> 58:20.490]  You have to make one jump.
[58:20.770 --> 58:21.650]  You have to.
[58:21.810 --> 58:22.470]  That's why we fell.
[58:22.470 --> 58:23.630]  You have to be able to make one.
[58:23.750 --> 58:24.250]  Alright, you ready?
[58:24.930 --> 58:25.150]  Yep.
[58:25.390 --> 58:25.590]  Go!
[58:32.870 --> 58:34.510]  Eric's now down to small grunts.
[58:34.910 --> 58:35.030]  Oops.
[58:38.170 --> 58:39.450]  Back to the car.
[58:49.950 --> 58:50.350]  Meow.
[58:50.350 --> 58:50.470]  Oh, wow.
[58:50.710 --> 58:51.970]  Dude, it's like a Tesla.
[58:52.270 --> 58:54.410]  When you release the gas, it just stops.
[58:55.390 --> 58:56.150]  What are you doing?
[58:57.390 --> 58:58.190]  Holy shit.
[58:58.190 --> 58:58.850]  You crazy, baby.
[58:59.630 --> 59:00.750]  What, you don't like that?
[59:00.990 --> 59:01.390]  Meow.
[59:02.670 --> 59:04.570]  This is how I drive my 9800X, huh?
[59:04.990 --> 59:05.810]  Yeah, we know.
[59:07.010 --> 59:07.750]  I can't go.
[59:07.830 --> 59:08.370]  It's not going forward.
[59:08.390 --> 59:09.150]  Okay, stop.
[59:10.210 --> 59:10.610]  You...
[59:10.610 --> 59:11.630]  That's when you went?
[59:11.970 --> 59:12.630]  No, the gap...
[59:12.630 --> 59:14.310]  Well, I think it might be different on our screens.
[59:14.870 --> 59:15.590]  Because you hit...
[59:15.590 --> 59:18.350]  Because when you were driving, you hit every one of those on my screen.
[59:18.490 --> 59:18.990]  Oh, okay.
[59:19.370 --> 59:20.670]  Oh, yeah, you did.
[59:20.870 --> 59:21.150]  Absolutely.
[59:21.270 --> 59:23.090]  Yeah, you hit every single one on my screen.
[59:23.490 --> 59:23.510]  Interesting.
[59:23.770 --> 59:25.770]  Maybe you got glanced by a couple.
[59:28.110 --> 59:28.870]  Didn't touch them.
[59:29.410 --> 59:29.910]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[59:29.910 --> 59:30.370]  Ask Andrew.
[59:30.470 --> 59:31.070]  It does.
[59:31.250 --> 59:31.850]  Yeah, that was clean.
[59:31.870 --> 59:32.430]  Ask Andrew.
[59:32.550 --> 59:33.210]  Clean run.
[59:34.750 --> 59:36.310]  Alright, we're making this one, guys.
[59:36.490 --> 59:36.930]  Let's go.
[59:37.310 --> 59:37.490]  Ready?
[59:37.830 --> 59:39.530]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[59:39.970 --> 59:40.370]  Go!
[59:40.550 --> 59:41.370]  You said let's go.
[59:41.590 --> 59:42.090]  I just don't...
[59:42.090 --> 59:43.410]  I just don't understand.
[59:43.490 --> 59:45.270]  You said let's go!
[59:45.270 --> 59:47.150]  You know that it turns one more time.
[59:47.150 --> 59:47.610]  He screamed let's go.
[59:47.670 --> 59:49.150]  Like, you know it turns.
[59:49.350 --> 59:50.390]  We've done it three times.
[59:50.390 --> 59:51.390]  You screamed let's go.
[59:51.550 --> 59:54.270]  You can't scream let's go if you're not ready to go.
[59:54.510 --> 59:54.930]  You know.
[59:55.070 --> 59:56.170]  You've seen it do it.
[59:56.490 --> 59:57.290]  You've seen it do it.
[59:57.290 --> 59:59.990]  Which is why it was irresponsible of Eric to scream that.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.050]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.070]  Hey, go!
[01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.190]  Oh, no, don't go.
[01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:06.450]  Hey, hey, hey.
[01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:06.770]  Insane.
[01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:08.590]  I know I said go, but I didn't fucking mean it.
[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:09.250]  Alright, hang on, wait.
[01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.850]  Hang on.
[01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.030]  This is my favorite part.
[01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.590]  Gavin is just...
[01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:13.370]  He's leading.
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.470]  I don't know why we're waiting.
[01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:16.490]  Why don't we just do this?
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.330]  He's right, you know.
[01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:19.870]  Okay.
[01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.190]  Okay.
[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:24.950]  I'm getting weighed down a little bit now.
[01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:25.830]  I can't sort of...
[01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:26.190]  Yeah.
[01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.270]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.270]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.150]  Everyone else is weighing down Gavin.
[01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:30.710]  That's what's going on.
[01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:31.030]  There you go, Geoff.
[01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:31.410]  I got you.
[01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.030]  There you go.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:39.680]  Jesus.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.460]  This is the funniest way to do this from the guy that couldn't do it.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.260]  Well, this is much easier.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.460]  I'm protecting you from my incompetence.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.040]  Geoff.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:50.840]  We're all like...
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.560]  We tied this freaking thing in a knot.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.380]  Someone needs to...
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.560]  There you go.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.160]  I have sweat running down to my elbows.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.000]  It sucks.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:06.680]  It sucks.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.000]  It's not even hot in here.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.500]  Is that scene from Airplane for all of you?
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.200]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.320]  Okay.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.900]  So, how did we fail this last time?
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.920]  Two people over jumped.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.500]  Spectacularly.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.000]  Yeah.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:19.540]  Okay.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.500]  So, is this just a go, go, go situation?
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.200]  Yeah.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.180]  Let's just take it one at a time.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.680]  I think it's a stop and land.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:24.920]  Yeah.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:25.760]  Stop, land, go.
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:27.700]  You're up.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:28.640]  All right.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.660]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:31.700]  Okay.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.120]  Wait.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.320]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:36.520]  Oops.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:38.960]  Overshot it at that.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.400]  All right.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.380]  All right.
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:40.580]  Ready?
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.580]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.640]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.160]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.420]  All right.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.520]  Why did someone go without going?
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:56.660]  Geoff, what the hell?
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.060]  What was that?
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:57.700]  All right.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.160]  Let's...
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.160]  All right.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.320]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:00.660]  This is a sprint jump.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.040]  I didn't know if that was real or not.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.480]  I just went.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.020]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:05.880]  All right.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:06.520]  Oops.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.100]  All right.
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.360]  This one we'll just do like the beginning.
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:09.980]  Okay.
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:12.400]  Yeah.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.740]  This is very beginning vibes.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.120]  Easy.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.220]  Now, let's look.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.080]  Let's stop and...
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.200]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:17.760]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.260]  Hold on.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.160]  I got to blame Geoff for that one.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.160]  I mean, that's an easy...
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:23.400]  Okay.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.220]  That's an easy thing to do.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:24.380]  All right.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.420]  I definitely think it's not my fault, but that's cool.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:27.780]  Okay.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.560]  Okay, so we've got to just go.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:29.840]  All right.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.440]  Well, I guess...
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.520]  That was crazy.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.800]  That was madness.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:33.560]  Insane.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.120]  Yeah, I mean, that was...
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.800]  That was jumping to the wrong one.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:36.820]  Keep going.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.000]  Oh, word.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.460]  We're losing our shit.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:39.880]  All right.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.320]  That was perfect.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:40.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.960]  I got to put that on Geoff.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:43.720]  Hey, Geoff?
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:43.940]  Yeah.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:44.920]  Geoff, we made it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.580]  That's on you.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:45.960]  Good job.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:46.920]  I'll take it.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.380]  We made it.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.860]  I got to give it up to you, dude.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.380]  Thank you.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:49.840]  Thank you.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:50.340]  What?
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.940]  Oh, it made some stuff.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:52.600]  Yeah.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.400]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.040]  Hang on.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.420]  Come back.
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:55.860]  Come back.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.120]  Come back.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.620]  It's time.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:56.920]  We're waiting.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.200]  We're waiting.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.040]  It's time.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.700]  Let's see how long it goes.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.160]  So, stop touching it.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:01.760]  Right.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.180]  I'm going to be back here.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:07.020]  You guys get as close as you can to it, and then I'll come back and press the thing again.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.540]  Oh, that's not long.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:10.780]  Yes.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.560]  No.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.520]  Okay, hang on.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:12.840]  Ready?
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.320]  Yeah.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.280]  Okay, I'm going to hit it, and then we're going to go.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:15.580]  Okay.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.340]  Here we go.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.300]  Go.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:17.680]  Let's go.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.020]  Run.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:20.820]  Ooh.
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:21.320]  Spring, baby.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:23.800]  Oh, Eric, you should not be...
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.160]  While we can't be climbing, we're just going to be jumping.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.340]  This isn't...
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:27.840]  We're going to go.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.380]  Eric should not be in the front.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.580]  Andrew, I'm jumping as ha...
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.980]  Like, Gavin is in the back, and it is just killing me.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:36.520]  You guys got to go.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.000]  Like, I need to go.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.580]  I need you to know that none of...
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:42.360]  I need you to know that none of what just happened, that was all Gavin, dude.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.160]  Gavin is in the back dragging it down.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.060]  I couldn't stop mantling.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.080]  Both jump.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:47.880]  All right.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.780]  All right, we're going to need to sprint jump to this, probably.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.400]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.340]  Yeah, I think...
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.960]  And I think when we hit it, we just go again.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.240]  Yeah.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:53.740]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.080]  But, Nick, you call it out.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.540]  Okay, ready?
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.760]  Three, two, one, go.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:01.760]  That's it, fellas.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.040]  That was nicely done.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.740]  That was so good.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.160]  Ooh, an elevator.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.600]  Oh, it's a lift.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.560]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.160]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:07.700]  Oh, we're good.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.160]  Okay, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like a jump or we fell or something.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.100]  I'm...
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:12.660]  I'm...
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.480]  I have sweat.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.920]  I'm so fucking wet.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:16.000]  I'm wet.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.040]  I'm soaked.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.100]  Look at our...
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:18.440]  Look at our...
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.400]  We're getting three meters here.
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.000]  Not even having to do anything.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.560]  That is some height.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.160]  Ooh, the whispering vault.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.580]  The whispering vault.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.040]  Wow, we've reached the mysterious cave.
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.540]  So...
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.500]  And Eric wanted to stop.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.960]  There's a few different ways to go.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:34.620]  Well, let's...
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.780]  Let's check this way first.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.100]  It's mysterious.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.620]  I need to turn my fan on.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.060]  Okay, I turned mine off.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.980]  We're supposed to record two episodes of the podcast today?
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:46.620]  Yeah, we have to.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.780]  I'm not gonna have it in me.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.900]  I just don't know what it's gonna...
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.620]  We could do one tomorrow.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.340]  I...
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.800]  I don't like...
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.960]  I don't like...
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.860]  I'll jump in and see if it kills me.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.080]  Okay.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:58.520]  Okay.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:04:59.160]  No?
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.680]  Oh, we can get an oxygen...
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.140]  There's not an oxygen meter as far as I can tell, but there is a spot to swim under over here.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.440]  Okay, let's go.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.740]  How do you go down?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.960]  Looks like you just look down.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.000]  Think you just aim?
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.240]  Thanks.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:13.960]  Easy.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.460]  Not bad.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.660]  Not bad, guys.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.920]  Like an Elden Ring gate.
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.840]  Wish I had a sword.
[01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.080]  More free meters.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.820]  Might be pushing 500 here.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:31.620]  Backwards.
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.650]  Think tomorrow might be a long day.
[01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:44.870]  I'm thinking today's my long day. It's getting a bit ragged.
[01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:46.350]  Half a K!
[01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.630]  When? After the podcast?
[01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:51.930]  Andrew, I don't know about you, but I'm thinking taking this week off.
[01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:55.090]  Oh, we got another time thing.
[01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:56.630]  Oh, hang on.
[01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:57.330]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:58.950]  Let's see where it goes.
[01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:00.550]  There's two of them.
[01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:02.170]  You guys just entered a destiny ring.
[01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:05.210]  Oh, I think the two of us have to be on it at the same time. Let's see.
[01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.750]  You think so?
[01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:05.890]  Yeah.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:06.730]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:09.890]  Okay, so it's me and Nick because I'm the furthest from him.
[01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:11.510]  So I need you guys to come over this way.
[01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:12.010]  Okay, so I'll stay here.
[01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:14.450]  Nick, I need you to stay on that.
[01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:17.350]  Gavin and Geoff, come with me and just go as far as you can, Geoff.
[01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:18.110]  Where?
[01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.590]  Higher up.
[01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:23.150]  There's two.
[01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:24.010]  What?
[01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:24.970]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:26.730]  Oh, you know what? We activated it. It's activated.
[01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:28.450]  We just need to reach the other one.
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:31.470]  Yeah, because if you were a closed chain, that wouldn't be possible.
[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:32.650]  No, no, you're right.
[01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.410]  Oh, damn it.
[01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:38.570]  Good jumps.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:39.810]  Oh, fucking hell.
[01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:43.730]  Yeah, there we go. We're good.
[01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:47.290]  Let me lead this. Gavin, you're going to come with me. Ready?
[01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:47.690]  Yeah.
[01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:49.430]  One, two, three.
[01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.350]  There we go. I just needed to get the slack going.
[01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.130]  You got it?
[01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:58.190]  You going to give us the old pull here?
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:06.560]  Alright.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.260]  I want to pull Geoff. I want to pull Eric.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.760]  You got to stay up there if you're going to do that, I think.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.080]  Alright.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.380]  Good pull, man.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.400]  You're just going.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:24.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.260]  I got tired of you.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.500]  It's open. Let's go.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.880]  Go, go, go, go.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.900]  Alright, it's Mario but with a spike.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.480]  Oh, shit. Hang on. Wait.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.480]  Okay, I guess we're going.
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:38.900]  Oh, God.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:39.620]  Are we?
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.480]  Keep climbing up. Keep climbing up.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]  Oh, you're on the back.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:48.640]  We're on the back but I don't think it matters.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.580]  I think it does because you have less time to avoid spikes.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.540]  No, no, no. Don't go yet.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.600]  Why, why, why?
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:55.900]  Stop.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:57.220]  God.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.880]  Oh, you guys saved me.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Geoff, we were safe, right?
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.780]  We were fine.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.160]  Geoff, Geoff, we were totally fine.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.240]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.940]  Get off the...
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.140]  We did it, we did it, we did it.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.160]  How did we do that like that?
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.300]  Geoff, I feel like we were locked in, right?
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.240]  Yeah, pretty locked in. I think how we did it was super skilled.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.860]  I mean, like you and me, dude, we had that shit.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.920]  They were fucking scared little babies.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.320]  Y'all did it. Y'all did it.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:22.600]  Oh, no.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:23.980]  Y'all did it. We did it.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.520]  I'll just hang out here on the side.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:29.920]  Geoff.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:33.580]  You gotta see that on my screen.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.880]  Oh, fuck me.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.620]  I lost the...
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620]  Oh, no.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.120]  We got some crossies and jumpies. Do we need to transfer?
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.640]  Yeah, we should transfer over.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.580]  I think what we do is we transfer over there on the right and we have to keep transferring.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.780]  All right, you wanna make a run?
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.660]  So transfer every available?
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.700]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think so. Let's do it.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:56.380]  So the next one that we come across here, I think that's where we have to transfer.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.180]  Okay.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:57.960]  Ready?
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:58.460]  Yeah.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:08:59.860]  Go.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:00.940]  Okay.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.400]  Okay, so we have to jump that when we get close to it.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.360]  I think we do have to jump this.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.080]  Okay.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.100]  Nicely done.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.320]  And then transfer to the...
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.320]  And I think we transfer here.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:12.460]  Yeah.
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.220]  We transfer here. Ready?
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:13.740]  This is our stop.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:13.980]  Let's go.
[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.180]  Okay.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:17.540]  Okay.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:18.280]  Fine.
[01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.980]  Okay, so I think we do have to transfer to this one.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:21.520]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:22.860]  Okay.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:23.500]  You guys ready?
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:23.880]  Yeah.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:24.460]  Here we go.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:25.680]  Okay.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:27.100]  Good work.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.840]  Okay, now we ride this all the way.
[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.480]  Easy peasy.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:30.280]  This is team building.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.160]  We're building the team.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.060]  Yeah.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:35.700]  I like you guys a lot more now than earlier.
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:36.340]  Please wait.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.960]  Please don't jump until we're like way closer.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:38.920]  Please just wait.
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.560]  That's so funny that you said that.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.400]  I was just about to jump.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:41.720]  Please just wait.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.000]  Yeah, I had the same thought actually.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.760]  Yeah, that's part of the team building, Gavin.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.420]  Yeah.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.880]  See, I was ready to receive instruction.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.620]  Why am I in the front?
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.240]  Okay, hang on.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:50.640]  Wait.
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.180]  Wait.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:51.560]  Wait.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.440]  Let me go first.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:56.760]  I'm on.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.220]  I'm on.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:57.860]  Gavin, we're on.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:58.560]  Up a little.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.020]  Up a little.
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:09:59.440]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.760]  Okay.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  Okay, here we go.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.040]  Ready?
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:02.520]  Yeah.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.300]  Here we go.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.840]  Okay, I'll hold the line for a sec.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:05.500]  No.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:05.980]  All right.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.700]  We're fucked.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.560]  We're fucked.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.580]  Well, that's everything.
[01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:13.850]  What are we on?
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:15.150]  What are we on?
[01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:16.070]  What are you on top of?
[01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.030]  That doesn't matter.
[01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.390]  I think this is the thing we have to swim down.
[01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:21.010]  No.
[01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:22.690]  We're on top of a pool?
[01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:25.750]  This is like the whispering cave.
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:27.670]  Can you hear it?
[01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.550]  Yeah, I got a whisper for you.
[01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:30.830]  Hurry up.
[01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.090]  Yeah, I mean, eventually, Gavin's going to start pulling you guys up and it's going to be so sick.
[01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:35.790]  I'm pulling.
[01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:36.810]  I don't know what you want from me.
[01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:38.030]  To pull us?
[01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:41.770]  Come on, Geoff.
[01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:43.050]  I mean, I think that's pretty clear.
[01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.810]  I'm with you.
[01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:45.010]  How did we get Nick before Geoff?
[01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.170]  I swung.
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.770]  I was pulling back up.
[01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:49.870]  Yeah, he was, Geoff.
[01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:50.390]  Oh.
[01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:51.790]  Well, this is interesting.
[01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:53.150]  We'll just make our way up here.
[01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:54.650]  We're on top of the swimmy tunnel.
[01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:55.370]  Tummel?
[01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:55.930]  Great.
[01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:57.150]  Not sure.
[01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:58.670]  Oh, no, there you go.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:10:59.310]  Humming Nester.
[01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:03.010]  Oh, okay, look, guys.
[01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.850]  We can climb up this little alcove.
[01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.410]  Oh, wait.
[01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.830]  Stop, stop, stop.
[01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.670]  Stop.
[01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:08.230]  What?
[01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.970]  Hold on to the hole, right?
[01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:09.990]  Oh, yeah, there's a hole.
[01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.230]  There's a hole to fall down where we go.
[01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:12.970]  Jeez.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.480]  Hey, man, you want to go the wrong way, we keep doing that.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.400]  You let me know.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.040]  I got no problem.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.900]  Listen, I'm a better climber than a swimmer, all right?
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.660]  I can tell by the way you're hanging off.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.700]  Well, that...
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.980]  Oh, it's like a...
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:33.480]  That was it.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.060]  No free meters on this trip.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:39.520]  Oh, no.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.560]  I feel like this is a three-part video already.
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.320]  There's surely some repeat chain work we can cut.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:48.860]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.300]  Yeah, but not discussion.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.440]  Half a K.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780]  All right.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:57.900]  Again.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.780]  Okay, the door is still open.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.180]  The door is pre-opened.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:04.720]  This is my favorite.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.780]  No need for a rush.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.720]  Maybe you guys can do it on the same side.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.460]  Hang on.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.540]  Okay, Nicky, you can call it out.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.560]  Three, two, one, go!
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:20.200]  Okay.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.540]  Okay, let's wait, let's wait, let's wait.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.540]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.260]  Eric, wait.
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:25.700]  I'm waiting.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:27.780]  I'm just waiting.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.880]  I'm waiting on the other side.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.540]  And we have to wait.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.160]  Me and Geoff already locked this one in.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.720]  This is nothing.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:33.960]  All right, go.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.420]  Geoff, first aid is dropped.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:46.760]  What are you doing?
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:47.400]  Geoff.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.440]  I'm with Geoff.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:48.900]  Let's go.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.540]  How powerful my grip on that fence was.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.180]  Pretty good.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.020]  Oh, man.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.160]  Geoff's got to do this again.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.860]  I'm trying to hang out with my friend Geoff all the way in the back.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.280]  Yep.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.460]  Every time.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.460]  All right, let's just hit it as soon as this one goes.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.440]  We're getting on this one.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.580]  I like everyone has their weaknesses in this.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:17.600]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.100]  What's yours?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:20.780]  Mine's womp.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:22.740]  What's mine?
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.220]  Mine's womping.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.960]  Oh, man.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.000]  This game is crazy.
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.720]  Mine's direction, but that's it.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.240]  Oh, good dodge.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.240]  Oh, that was...
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.340]  All right, here comes our ride.
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.180]  Just going to the airport, Gavin.
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:53.200]  Ready?
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:54.720]  Here we go.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:56.960]  Nice and easy.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.420]  All right, what did we do wrong with this one?
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:03.960]  We fell.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:04.920]  We just fell.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.660]  The jump is hard to...
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.020]  Yeah, the jump is hard to time.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.560]  Should we have been walking instead of jumping?
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:12.520]  We could try.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.360]  No, I think the gap is too big to walk, but the jump is too...
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.840]  Like, you have to, like, not aim for, like, the very edge.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.720]  You have to, like, find the next closest part.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.500]  Yeah, you got to get the middle.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.220]  So, here.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.040]  Okay, I'm going to go.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:24.380]  Ready?
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.140]  Here I go.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:28.500]  Gavin?
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:28.840]  Oh!
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:29.800]  Okay.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:30.420]  Oh.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.660]  Going to land the right way.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.060]  Guys, thank you so much for watching this video.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.140]  Surely, this is the end of the video.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:40.720]  Yeah.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.000]  I can't... I can't keep playing this.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.420]  One more go?
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.340]  One more go.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:44.860]  What?
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:45.640]  This is it.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.240]  This is it.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.840]  And if we fall this time, we'll miss the roof and we'll just head all the way down.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.160]  Yeah, we'll just go to the beginning.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.260]  Really teach ourselves a lesson.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.220]  Doing it another time.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:01.960]  Okay, we got it.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.440]  I mean, it's easy to that point.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.420]  You guys had no problems to that point.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.580]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.420]  Eric has figured out how to bully.
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.020]  Great.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.000]  Oh my God.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.400]  Yeah, that's my weakness in this game.
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:21.760]  Half a K?
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.140]  Okay, shut up. Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.920]  Eric, by chance, who would you replace in this with Andrew if you had to pick?
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.220]  Me.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:32.600]  Yeah.
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:35.780]  The classic...
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.860]  I would replace me.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.400]  The classic immunity bullet question.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.640]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.360]  Why? Why? Why?
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.460]  I thought we weren't talking about this one anymore.
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.120]  Why are you talking about it?
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.900]  We just do this one now. We don't stop for this.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.740]  I think...
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.860]  I think we lost.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:05.440]  Well, guys, thanks for watching. Make sure you follow us on social media.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.100]  Regulation podcast.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.120]  Really appreciate you watching this piece of shit.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.120]  What the fuck?
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.940]  You think I can still get a refund for this game?
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.880]  Thank you guys so much for watching. Listen to the podcast.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.360]  Next time, watch us do it, but we're in a square.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.200]  What?
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:25.980]  Yeah.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:26.280]  No.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.920]  This isn't even the hard... I put this on normal instead of beginner.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.180]  And I put us in a line instead of the square.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.940]  So we're just gonna do it different next time.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.700]  Guys, thank you so much for watching. We'll see you next time.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:35.300]  Bye.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.040]  Bye.
