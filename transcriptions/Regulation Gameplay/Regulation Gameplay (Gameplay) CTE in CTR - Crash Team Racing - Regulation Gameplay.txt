[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Andrew do you want to lead it since you picked the game?
[00:02.920 --> 00:03.120]  Sure
[00:12.470 --> 00:13.210]  Go right ahead
[00:13.850 --> 00:14.450]  Yeah, I
[00:15.830 --> 00:17.410]  I'm not sure. What are we waiting for now?
[00:17.550 --> 00:23.450]  Hello and welcome to a regulation gameplay of Crash Team Racing, a game that I picked. This is my game
[00:23.450 --> 00:27.410]  I made this choice fully me. Did you not pick it? Who else picked it?
[00:27.650 --> 00:31.470]  Oh, I suggested it and then I felt like we were all playing it
[00:31.470 --> 00:35.630]  I honestly thought we were gonna do something else, but I'm excited to play it. What? You thought you were?
[00:35.630 --> 00:41.470]  What are you talking about? You sound like you're having 20% less fun than you used to. No, I'm really excited to play it
[00:41.470 --> 00:46.030]  I look like a Beyblade. I'm representing Canada. This is gonna be a whole national pride thing.
[00:46.970 --> 00:53.470]  I did some Beyblading at Christmas this year. All you guys looking like a bunch of losers with your blue everything
[00:53.470 --> 01:00.130]  I'm switching it up. You did some real Beyblading? Yeah. Yeah, I did some real Beyblading when I was in Detroit
[01:00.790 --> 01:01.190]  Really?
[01:02.030 --> 01:02.390]  Yeah
[01:03.150 --> 01:04.970]  Kids kids got Beyblades for Christmas
[01:06.710 --> 01:09.210]  I've never done it before it was fun. Why did Andrew say yeah?
[01:09.490 --> 01:13.170]  Well, yeah, why didn't Andrew say yes, did you hear the part that Geoff did it?
[01:13.210 --> 01:16.230]  I thought you're asking anyone who has done real Beyblading and I certainly
[01:19.850 --> 01:23.290]  We just started you don't even know like you're
[01:25.090 --> 01:26.810]  You want to like I
[01:27.750 --> 01:30.830]  Dude, is it a is go or a trigger is go?
[01:32.650 --> 01:34.470]  Hey, hey, hey, oh
[01:35.410 --> 01:35.790]  Yeah
[01:36.990 --> 01:40.590]  Get out of my way. Oh god. Oh, how do you use?
[01:42.770 --> 01:48.850]  That's for you Gavin, oh, why'd you do that shit? I could do a little jumpy jump
[01:53.330 --> 01:58.590]  Played this a little bit. I don't know. I didn't had to be done Nick. I did
[01:58.590 --> 02:01.570]  You were next. Yeah, what the fuck like I think
[02:03.230 --> 02:04.590]  Me I did that
[02:06.070 --> 02:11.070]  I'm no threat. I mean you're a threat. All right. All right
[02:12.990 --> 02:13.950]  Older game
[02:16.050 --> 02:22.050]  According to Eric it has the load times of one to God that load time suck for no reason
[02:24.670 --> 02:28.730]  This pop mean drift or is it just hop? Okay, right bumpers drift
[02:29.270 --> 02:33.210]  Okay, I see you hop in but you have to hit the opposite
[02:34.150 --> 02:38.090]  Drift to get a boost. It's so the controls of this game
[02:38.670 --> 02:43.210]  Suck, if you made this game, why did you do this? Oh
[02:43.210 --> 02:44.730]  Boy, oh, I'm getting exploded
[02:45.670 --> 02:49.570]  It's like, uh, this is naughty dog. Yeah, I
[02:50.710 --> 02:55.810]  Wish you guys would stop attacking me. Sorry. It's not there are there I think there are computers here, too
[02:59.010 --> 03:06.090]  Yeah, you got me yeah be cool if I could note which one oh, there's Nick great
[03:07.570 --> 03:10.210]  By the way, what am I one of I
[03:11.270 --> 03:18.630]  Think Bernie Burns least favorite things about me is my mocking and I am definitely like back in a mocking phase right now
[03:23.250 --> 03:28.490]  Place this is brutal. Yeah, I think the other day we had an old school. I was saying something and you just went
[03:31.650 --> 03:37.510]  What I would do when we would sit and do season one of Red vs. Blue and it was just me and the other one
[03:37.510 --> 03:38.990]  in a spare bedroom
[03:39.890 --> 03:43.290]  Listening to fucking Gus and Eric or not Eric Gus and Jason
[03:44.250 --> 03:51.890]  Bad act for fucking four hours at a time. I would just fucking I just make fun of them mercilessly and it would drive Bernie nuts
[03:55.330 --> 03:58.130]  It's good to know I'm the Jason that's pretty cool
[04:00.510 --> 04:05.130]  We lost all of the yeah, we lost. Yeah, we we lost the AI Nick came in second
[04:06.850 --> 04:08.850]  Challenge completed. Yeah
[04:10.390 --> 04:12.350]  Nick's classic catchphrase was
[04:14.430 --> 04:16.650]  Call me on my phone
[04:17.150 --> 04:20.310]  Okay, so this game you drink controls insanely
[04:20.830 --> 04:25.670]  You drift with the right bumper or left bumper and you slide and then you hit the other bumper to initiate a bit
[04:25.670 --> 04:28.210]  Yeah, but yeah, but there's like a timing to it
[04:28.710 --> 04:34.650]  Like your meter will fill up in like your lower left like lower right hand corner. It's so
[04:35.170 --> 04:40.130]  Dumb, but you hit the other bumper. Yeah. Yeah shit. Yeah, I want to change
[04:41.030 --> 04:46.210]  Hang on do I have to go back? Notice you're gonna quit. I don't want to quit game settings. Here we go
[04:46.210 --> 04:51.810]  All right, let's go to this is called turbo track. Yeah, I like a turbo track. Yeah
[04:51.810 --> 04:56.550]  It's also gonna be five laps because it's turbo. Okay turbo. Yeah
[04:56.550 --> 05:02.970]  I think one of these crashes needs to not be crash. I agree. Yeah, I agree
[05:04.690 --> 05:06.750]  Do you remember Gavin one time
[05:09.270 --> 05:10.750]  What the end
[05:12.370 --> 05:16.890]  Go ahead one of these guys go ahead. Yeah. Anyway, Gavin you remember this stuff
[05:18.610 --> 05:21.030]  Do you remember one time
[05:21.910 --> 05:23.470]  There was like a new
[05:24.170 --> 05:26.530]  motorcycle racing game that came out on
[05:27.690 --> 05:32.950]  Game pass not game. Whatever is arcade Xbox arcade and I was like, oh we should play that Monday and everybody's like, okay
[05:32.950 --> 05:37.770]  So I had everybody download it and then over the weekend. I played I want to say I put like 35 hours
[05:38.350 --> 05:39.310]  Are you serious?
[05:40.410 --> 05:44.190]  Completely and totally maxed out my character, but it didn't look any different
[05:44.190 --> 05:51.430]  Didn't change the gear or anything, you know, and I destroyed you guys and everybody gets so fucking angry
[05:51.430 --> 05:53.830]  And it was it like the Avatar bike game. Yeah
[05:56.890 --> 06:01.950]  I just secretly fucking I just hammered it all weekend long just to fucking
[06:02.610 --> 06:06.390]  Just to have the most unfair edge ever. That should have been shenanigans
[06:07.670 --> 06:13.230]  That was just a fucking oh, I get this now. Okay happy again
[06:19.810 --> 06:22.130]  I'm stuck face first into a wall
[06:27.550 --> 06:31.350]  Nick attacks, do you have some sort of a special deal with the officials or have you hit me?
[06:31.610 --> 06:33.690]  I'm gonna time you get official second place
[06:35.870 --> 06:42.790]  Second you know what Gavin he Gavin wants to come in guaranteed second place. Ah, you moved. Never mind
[06:43.970 --> 06:50.050]  Suck it. I'm gonna hit these booze. Thanks. There we go. Second way bad. There's a lot of money in being Carlos signs
[06:50.630 --> 06:52.310]  That's for you. Oh
[06:53.050 --> 06:53.690]  I missed
[06:54.530 --> 06:56.490]  Wow, I was caught up to my rocket. That was cool
[06:56.550 --> 07:01.930]  What am I do? I'm trying to get a boost when I have nitrous. It's used to nitrous dummy Gavin. That's for you
[07:04.870 --> 07:10.470]  Get Andrew does this bring back Garfield memories? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to tap into that right now. I'm trying to get my od on
[07:13.070 --> 07:14.790]  Drifting in this game sucks
[07:16.510 --> 07:17.150]  Pin bit
[07:18.790 --> 07:19.690]  Don't think you do
[07:20.410 --> 07:22.090]  Do you use the break to do this? What?
[07:23.570 --> 07:28.850]  No, is this a stopping break I'm getting my I miss you but full flat
[07:31.050 --> 07:37.630]  Well, we would be playing that if Andrew didn't pick this game and then immediately back away from picking me picking that you guys are
[07:37.630 --> 07:38.970]  all playing the game
[07:41.370 --> 07:46.430]  You said here's this game let's play this game I even said
[07:46.430 --> 07:50.550]  Last night. I said, I think the audience really liked it when we played human fall flat
[07:52.410 --> 07:56.870]  Sounds like it would be fun. Yeah a couple thumbs up for it and I thought okay. Well, we'll probably doing that
[07:57.970 --> 08:01.330]  It's like, okay, I guess we'll do that second. I
[08:01.330 --> 08:02.650]  Think they're just upset. He's not winning
[08:04.450 --> 08:06.670]  Where we had to lead Andrews law
[08:08.450 --> 08:12.510]  This might be the worst car racer I've ever played. Yeah, I agree. Oh shit
[08:14.450 --> 08:17.410]  Like Sonic team racing and shit is like better than this
[08:18.130 --> 08:20.810]  Racing is great though. That's a bad comparable. Yeah
[08:22.490 --> 08:27.110]  Yeah compared to this is a really great Mario Kart is great compared to this Mario
[08:28.550 --> 08:31.730]  Don't don't bring that I know it's against Andrews religion. I don't like yeah
[08:34.450 --> 08:36.310]  What about it
[08:37.330 --> 08:39.410]  Mushrooms, I guess I don't know much
[08:45.490 --> 08:46.910]  Not for racing
[08:46.910 --> 08:51.250]  God, I've hit the wall on every one of these fucking hairpin turns
[08:52.530 --> 08:59.310]  I'm in hell. I'm it this sucks mid third place and it feels like I might as well be in 10th. I'm in fourth and I
[09:00.070 --> 09:05.210]  Don't know not forth anymore Gavin. Damn it Nick bastard. I
[09:05.210 --> 09:07.170]  Figured out the hairpin. How'd you do it?
[09:07.710 --> 09:12.790]  Use the brake not the hand one break X. Okay, I'm gonna give it to you
[09:15.630 --> 09:20.730]  Alright, I'm on my I'm on the final lap here get me out of here. Oh, no, no put it away
[09:20.730 --> 09:22.570]  No, don't shoot me. No
[09:23.410 --> 09:25.330]  No, that's for you. Okay, so you go, right?
[09:27.690 --> 09:29.930]  Andy's over here learning. I'm trying

[09:34.710 --> 09:38.470]  This is for you really are in your fucking bully face right now
[09:39.110 --> 09:41.530]  Bully faces had mocking face pay attention
[09:42.730 --> 09:44.230]  essentially the same
[09:44.930 --> 09:47.150]  Subtle difference. Oh, no, Nick you fool
[09:47.150 --> 09:47.850]  Oh
[09:49.370 --> 09:53.430]  Gavin please. Oh squash. Yeah, Gavin, please
[09:53.950 --> 09:59.470]  I'm flat. Oh, I squished you. I'm playing full flat. Oh
[10:00.430 --> 10:04.950]  Okay, daddy wins you guys lost a big norm and Papa Papa

[10:33.270 --> 10:33.750]  Oh
[10:35.950 --> 10:36.910]  My god
[10:47.400 --> 10:52.620]  Geoff is getting really in the baseball cards. It's bringing out his little inner inner inner shit stir as a kid
[11:03.360 --> 11:05.800]  I just mean that I'm having a lot of fun racing with you
[11:06.360 --> 11:11.860]  Could you do a track that doesn't have nine hairpin turns every that would be nice. No deal
[11:12.680 --> 11:15.700]  Um, I don't how do I how do I set it to turp?
[11:16.500 --> 11:17.380]  turbo track

[11:28.300 --> 11:31.180]  I am my style of driving is justice
[11:31.180 --> 11:35.020]  How do I set it to a different game mode
[11:35.020 --> 11:39.220]  I don't know if I can set two
[11:41.020 --> 11:42.260]  options no, I
[11:44.280 --> 11:48.400]  Don't I don't think I can set it to a battle. I think I have to quit all the way out. Let's
[11:49.020 --> 11:53.800]  Let's do one more race on barren ruins and then because I cuz Geoff's having a really good time and I want to make sure
[11:53.800 --> 11:57.740]  He keeps the ball rolling, you know, yeah, and then we'll yeah keep his wheels turning
[11:58.640 --> 11:59.000]  Yeah

[12:34.120 --> 12:40.080]  I'm trying to give the people at home a cinematic. Look. I like that the tires pick up the dust from the track
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.280]  I'm doing this for Canada
[12:44.100 --> 12:45.660]  Go go go go go go go go
[12:49.940 --> 12:52.300]  Okay, okay, this is a tight pack
[12:53.380 --> 13:02.600]  Always slip careful guys is a little slow. Oh, oh, there's no people in on the course. This is slippery. I
[13:02.600 --> 13:04.580]  These jumps feel unimpressive, don't they?
[13:04.580 --> 13:05.380]  Yep
[13:20.240 --> 13:26.320]  No the fucking beaker no missiles stop hitting me
[13:27.580 --> 13:31.840]  Have you guys seen the please don't destroy movie I'm told
[13:33.480 --> 13:33.840]  No.
[13:34.820 --> 13:35.840]  Did you watch it?
[13:35.940 --> 13:38.160]  Yeah. Legend of the Foggy Mountain or whatever.
[13:38.240 --> 13:38.660]  Yeah, it was alright.
[13:38.840 --> 13:38.900]  Yeah.
[13:39.580 --> 13:39.940]  Shit.
[13:40.660 --> 13:41.540]  God, you prick!
[13:41.540 --> 13:45.160]  Did it read like some kids whose dads were SNL writers wrote that movie?
[13:45.320 --> 13:50.100]  It... I thought it was gonna be... I was in the impression that they were like the Lonely Island.
[13:50.180 --> 13:51.600]  The new, like, version of the Lonely Island.
[13:51.940 --> 13:53.680]  That is the impression they're trying to give you.
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.440]  But they're not. They're like the workaholics people.
[13:55.920 --> 13:56.280]  Yeah.
[13:57.060 --> 13:58.560]  And... yeah, it was alright.
[13:59.320 --> 14:00.620]  Conan O'Brien was in it. He was pretty funny.
[14:00.620 --> 14:01.420]  Yeah.
[14:02.600 --> 14:05.340]  Eric, I shot you with a missile and then it just didn't do it.
[14:06.060 --> 14:07.500]  Well, that's because I'm so strong.
[14:07.700 --> 14:07.900]  Oh.
[14:08.420 --> 14:09.920]  I'm the Dingo Dial, baby.
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.260]  He's got you there.
[14:11.700 --> 14:14.840]  Yeah, you don't even consider who the Dingo Dial is. And it's me.
[14:14.920 --> 14:16.020]  This is the best I've done.
[14:16.320 --> 14:16.640]  Shit.
[14:16.820 --> 14:17.300]  Hey, congratulations.
[14:18.740 --> 14:19.580]  What place are you in?
[14:19.700 --> 14:20.440]  Third place.
[14:20.980 --> 14:21.420]  Oh, nice.
[14:22.480 --> 14:23.400]  God damn it.
[14:28.850 --> 14:31.170]  There's just men walking over the course. It's like...
[14:31.170 --> 14:31.750]  Yeah.
[14:31.750 --> 14:32.630]  It's like Starwing.
[14:35.230 --> 14:35.710]  Starwing?
[14:36.270 --> 14:36.570]  Yeah.
[14:37.090 --> 14:37.850]  What's Starwing?
[14:38.850 --> 14:39.330]  Starfox.
[14:39.650 --> 14:40.150]  Damn it.
[14:40.390 --> 14:41.710]  Oh, that's right. It's a different...
[14:41.710 --> 14:44.410]  It's Andrew. What are you talking about? It's Lilac Wars.
[14:44.690 --> 14:45.710]  Teenage Hero League.
[14:45.830 --> 14:46.590]  You love...
[14:46.590 --> 14:46.890]  It's Lilac Wars, dude.
[14:46.890 --> 14:50.310]  It's one of your favorite things, Gavin, having people say, what is it?
[14:50.390 --> 14:53.150]  And then explain it's the thing they know, but slightly different.
[14:55.970 --> 14:58.150]  Why would they take out the word fox?
[14:58.150 --> 15:00.190]  No, because... I don't know.
[15:00.870 --> 15:01.370]  Some of the...
[15:01.370 --> 15:07.050]  I think the worst one is Contra 4?
[15:08.370 --> 15:08.670]  Yeah?
[15:08.930 --> 15:09.490]  What is that?
[15:09.670 --> 15:15.810]  Where in England, it's called something like Super Probotector the Alien Wars.
[15:16.230 --> 15:16.750]  What?
[15:17.190 --> 15:18.750]  Or something. It's something similar to that.
[15:19.170 --> 15:19.690]  Probotector?
[15:20.210 --> 15:20.710]  Yeah.
[15:21.510 --> 15:27.690]  You're like, I think it's vaguely called this, and then said four of the most specific words I've ever heard.
[15:28.270 --> 15:30.270]  It's a mix of that kind of junk.
[15:30.510 --> 15:32.670]  And I remember liking it as a kid.
[15:32.730 --> 15:33.430]  My uncle had it.
[15:34.030 --> 15:36.850]  And then I was talking to someone about Contra.
[15:36.990 --> 15:37.770]  I was like, I've never heard of it.
[15:37.850 --> 15:39.910]  And then we ended up talking about the same game somehow.
[15:43.170 --> 15:47.730]  Oh, you mean Infestation Planet Liver Killer 6?
[15:48.390 --> 15:48.670]  Yeah.
[15:49.610 --> 15:50.890]  I love that game.
[15:52.130 --> 15:54.690]  I don't... The Star Fox one is such a weird one to me.
[15:54.690 --> 15:56.390]  It's like Star Fox?
[15:56.930 --> 15:59.050]  You had to change the Star Fox?
[15:59.050 --> 16:00.250]  They changed it to Star Wing.
[16:00.470 --> 16:04.330]  And then Star Fox 64 was called Delilah Wars.
[16:04.770 --> 16:05.750]  Yeah, Delilah Wars.
[16:06.290 --> 16:08.810]  That is the name of the system that they're in.
[16:08.990 --> 16:10.190]  And it's very strange.
[16:10.230 --> 16:11.550]  I always thought that was so bizarre.
[16:11.850 --> 16:13.870]  And once again, people talk about Star Fox.
[16:13.990 --> 16:14.970]  I was like, huh?
[16:18.390 --> 16:19.770]  Sounds a lot like Star Wing.
[16:19.790 --> 16:20.950]  Canada was called Star Frog.
[16:23.150 --> 16:26.350]  Yeah, big slippy toad guys up there.
[16:26.470 --> 16:27.650]  Yeah, they know their markets.
[16:27.730 --> 16:28.590]  Fox, help me!
[16:28.710 --> 16:28.870]  Yep.
[16:29.450 --> 16:29.870]  Eric wins.
[16:30.690 --> 16:31.490]  Did you win?
[16:32.130 --> 16:32.350]  Yeah.
[16:32.590 --> 16:33.010]  Damn you.
[16:34.730 --> 16:36.170]  I'm the dingo dial, baby.
[16:36.390 --> 16:37.630]  This is what happens when you dingo dial.
[16:38.130 --> 16:39.050]  I'm dingo dialed in.
[16:39.570 --> 16:40.770]  He did say that earlier on.
[16:40.990 --> 16:44.130]  Dude, I'm so far back in third.
[16:44.710 --> 16:46.310]  Yeah, I'm never gonna get to the end.
[16:47.310 --> 16:50.150]  Dingo dial sounds like a promotion a company would run in the 90s.
[16:50.150 --> 16:51.890]  Like, oh, you gotta call the number.
[16:51.990 --> 16:52.630]  You gotta dingo dial.
[16:53.970 --> 16:57.290]  The first dingo's to dial in get a free pizza for a year.
[16:58.110 --> 17:00.630]  It's definitely like a crocodile dundee tie-in.
[17:03.430 --> 17:04.730]  No crocs here.
[17:05.030 --> 17:06.110]  Dingo dial in.
[17:09.890 --> 17:12.450]  Okay, I will back out and have to send everyone invites.
[17:12.810 --> 17:13.130]  Yeah, let's do battle.
[17:13.450 --> 17:13.890]  I wanna do battle.
[17:14.010 --> 17:17.430]  Yeah, you're like itching for it.
[17:17.690 --> 17:17.830]  Yeah.
[17:17.830 --> 17:20.410]  Yeah, cause I'm coming in dead last and I just suck.
[17:20.450 --> 17:21.650]  I think it's the Beyblade vehicle.
[17:22.030 --> 17:24.370]  I think not having wheels is really throwing me.
[17:24.430 --> 17:25.350]  I gotta put some wheels on.
[17:25.990 --> 17:27.050]  Oh, yeah, you think that's it?
[17:27.430 --> 17:28.290]  I think so, yeah.
[17:28.810 --> 17:29.830]  There's the dingo dial.
[17:31.930 --> 17:35.150]  Is that Robin Williams when he was a robot on the ride?
[17:35.330 --> 17:35.850]  Oh, it's Gavin.
[17:36.730 --> 17:37.830]  I made it.
[17:38.910 --> 17:43.150]  Gavin, do you like Rocky Road or Parking Lot?
[17:44.190 --> 17:45.270]  Oh, Rocky Road.
[17:45.490 --> 17:45.730]  Yeah.
[17:46.110 --> 17:46.570]  Rocky Road it is.
[17:46.570 --> 17:47.330]  Okay, I found it.
[17:47.390 --> 17:50.470]  It was Contra 3, which was called The Alien Wars.
[17:50.770 --> 17:56.510]  But in Europe, it was Super Probotector Alien Rebels.
[17:57.630 --> 17:58.730]  What the fuck?
[17:58.730 --> 17:59.950]  They love Rebels over there.
[18:00.190 --> 18:02.410]  And they replaced the two men with two robots.
[18:02.810 --> 18:04.150]  What's a Probotector?
[18:04.510 --> 18:05.470]  I don't know.
[18:06.930 --> 18:08.250]  Pro Robot Protector.
[18:08.330 --> 18:10.730]  We should invent a Probotector.
[18:11.350 --> 18:11.730]  Yeah.
[18:11.870 --> 18:12.470]  Professional.
[18:12.910 --> 18:14.750]  That sounds like main podcast.
[18:14.750 --> 18:15.570]  Professional Robot.
[18:15.570 --> 18:17.210]  Professional Robot Protector.
[18:17.550 --> 18:18.170]  Or Detector.
[18:18.350 --> 18:19.410]  I guess this is Enema.
[18:20.530 --> 18:22.750]  I'm thinking something more like Enema as well.
[18:23.350 --> 18:25.470]  Do we want to do first to five points?
[18:25.650 --> 18:26.350]  No teams?
[18:26.770 --> 18:27.570]  I think that's the way to go.
[18:28.090 --> 18:28.850]  Free for all.
[18:29.190 --> 18:29.350]  Cool.
[18:30.090 --> 18:31.290]  Let me make sure it's saved.
[18:31.350 --> 18:32.670]  Everybody's somebody different now.
[18:33.850 --> 18:34.370]  That's great.
[18:34.530 --> 18:35.810]  And nobody's that obnoxious.
[18:35.970 --> 18:36.350]  Crash.
[18:40.010 --> 18:41.550]  Who's the little cat?
[18:42.090 --> 18:42.690]  A little kitty cat.
[18:43.270 --> 18:43.770]  That's nice.
[18:44.250 --> 18:45.830]  And then Andrew picked himself.
[18:45.910 --> 18:46.510]  That's really nice.
[18:47.630 --> 18:49.270]  I put a nuke in my head.
[18:49.350 --> 18:50.790]  If you hit me, we're all going to die.
[18:51.230 --> 18:53.390]  I will take this ball and go home with it.
[18:53.490 --> 18:54.150]  No fun.
[18:54.150 --> 18:55.190]  I thought you didn't like the Beyblade.
[18:56.530 --> 18:58.610]  I forgot to swap the Beyblade?
[19:00.910 --> 19:01.310]  Fuck.
[19:02.170 --> 19:03.190]  There's something wrong with this guy.
[19:03.350 --> 19:04.010]  I must have...
[19:04.010 --> 19:05.290]  I swore I did it.
[19:06.410 --> 19:06.810]  Okay.
[19:06.870 --> 19:07.290]  Here we go.
[19:07.390 --> 19:08.270]  This is Rocky Road.
[19:08.470 --> 19:09.670]  Who knows what we're doing?
[19:09.790 --> 19:10.170]  I don't.
[19:10.590 --> 19:11.010]  We're going to battle.
[19:12.870 --> 19:13.890]  Here comes the fun.
[19:14.110 --> 19:14.470]  Here comes the fun.
[19:14.470 --> 19:15.110]  We should play...
[19:15.110 --> 19:19.870]  We should mod every game so that right trigger is look backwards in every game we play.
[19:22.190 --> 19:22.690]  Oh shit.
[19:22.690 --> 19:23.430]  You really liking that?
[19:23.870 --> 19:24.890]  What are you supposed to do?
[19:24.890 --> 19:25.350]  Gavin is leaning.
[19:26.950 --> 19:27.630]  Kill each other.
[19:27.810 --> 19:28.370]  Kill each other, I think.
[19:29.430 --> 19:29.790]  Shit.
[19:29.950 --> 19:30.530]  Give me a weapon.
[19:31.250 --> 19:32.510]  No, you got to get a box.
[19:33.050 --> 19:34.690]  You got to go get your own weapons, dude.
[19:34.730 --> 19:36.130]  I know, but it's just giving me boosts.
[19:36.610 --> 19:37.550]  What fucking good is that?
[19:37.950 --> 19:39.530]  So you can drive faster to other boxes.
[19:40.070 --> 19:40.310]  Okay.
[19:41.010 --> 19:41.970]  Are there some weapons on the perimeter?
[19:41.970 --> 19:42.790]  Ah, you fuck.
[19:43.690 --> 19:44.170]  Got him.
[19:44.330 --> 19:45.430]  Oh, did he not die?
[19:45.910 --> 19:46.870]  Oh, get fucked.
[19:47.850 --> 19:48.770]  Gavin is leading.
[19:49.090 --> 19:50.230]  Get fucked by Geoff.
[19:50.290 --> 19:51.330]  Geoff just fucked you.
[19:51.770 --> 19:54.010]  Someone hit my thing on the floor.
[19:54.190 --> 19:54.950]  I put a thing down.
[19:57.150 --> 19:57.950]  It worked.
[20:00.110 --> 20:00.510]  Oh.
[20:01.970 --> 20:03.890]  Oh, I shot Geoff with something.
[20:04.210 --> 20:05.130]  Gavin, you keep seeing...
[20:05.550 --> 20:06.430]  I see how...
[20:06.430 --> 20:07.230]  Oh, let's see what's going on here.
[20:07.770 --> 20:08.710]  Oh, here we go.
[20:08.790 --> 20:09.890]  Here we go.
[20:09.890 --> 20:10.990]  Some issues, clearly.
[20:12.190 --> 20:13.250]  I shot someone.
[20:13.790 --> 20:14.750]  Where's somebody? Where's somebody?
[20:16.590 --> 20:17.170]  Take that.
[20:17.430 --> 20:18.610]  Nope, I didn't even fire.
[20:21.330 --> 20:22.370]  Take that.
[20:24.350 --> 20:25.230]  I'm on the board.
[20:25.510 --> 20:25.790]  Shit.
[20:29.330 --> 20:30.210]  God damn it.
[20:30.510 --> 20:32.750]  Maybe somebody will run into this trap that I have.
[20:32.870 --> 20:33.210]  Oh, good.
[20:33.330 --> 20:33.510]  No.
[20:34.330 --> 20:36.470]  I dropped down and I landed on a TNT.
[20:37.410 --> 20:37.770]  Whoa.
[20:38.450 --> 20:39.790]  Gavin won somehow.
[20:40.210 --> 20:41.510]  Fuck, I'm still AIDS.
[20:41.610 --> 20:41.810]  Okay.
[20:42.150 --> 20:43.230]  We'll do...
[20:44.450 --> 20:46.130]  We'll do more points.
[20:46.230 --> 20:48.150]  I think now we know what we're doing.
[20:49.210 --> 20:50.270]  Could you do it without AI?
[20:51.750 --> 20:55.870]  Let's do Capture the Flag where you bring it back to your own base and then see what happens.
[20:56.010 --> 21:03.030]  What if Capture the Flag is so much fun here that we create a machinima series out of it and it changes the course of all of our futures?
[21:04.690 --> 21:05.570]  What would we call it?
[21:06.550 --> 21:07.350]  We have to...
[21:07.350 --> 21:09.090]  It will be inspired in the moment.
[21:09.090 --> 21:09.730]  I don't know.
[21:09.850 --> 21:11.730]  Red Beyblade versus blue tires.
[21:12.170 --> 21:12.610]  Hell yeah.
[21:14.130 --> 21:15.510]  Okay, we're going to go to Parking Lot.
[21:16.230 --> 21:16.970]  I got it.
[21:17.130 --> 21:17.750]  I got no AI.
[21:18.750 --> 21:18.970]  Oh, wow.
[21:19.170 --> 21:19.610]  So it's the same.
[21:19.730 --> 21:25.690]  We're going to kill each other in this mode and then we'll Capture the Flag or whatever after.
[21:25.810 --> 21:27.070]  I saw my dad fight in one of these.
[21:27.210 --> 21:28.470]  This is going to be great.
[21:29.230 --> 21:29.790]  Go to Parking Lot?
[21:30.090 --> 21:30.250]  Yeah.
[21:30.470 --> 21:31.930]  You saw your dad fight in a parking lot?
[21:33.350 --> 21:33.730]  Maybe.
[21:34.990 --> 21:36.270]  I saw Michael do that once.
[21:36.290 --> 21:36.870]  He punched it.
[21:40.310 --> 21:42.010]  Wow, look at this parking lot.
[21:42.070 --> 21:42.870]  What the fuck?
[21:43.230 --> 21:44.470]  This is not what a parking lot looks like.
[21:45.210 --> 21:46.410]  This isn't a parking lot.
[21:46.530 --> 21:46.830]  What the hell is this?
[21:46.830 --> 21:47.470]  No, not at all.
[21:48.190 --> 21:49.450]  Especially not for the Dingo Dial.
[21:50.090 --> 21:51.810]  I mean, anywhere you stop driving is...
[21:51.810 --> 21:54.450]  Yeah, everywhere is a parking lot if you're not too scared to stop.
[21:56.010 --> 21:56.390]  Fire!
[21:57.530 --> 21:58.450]  Oh, come on.
[21:58.450 --> 21:59.030]  That didn't hit.
[21:59.130 --> 21:59.610]  That's bullshit.
[22:00.170 --> 22:00.910]  Oh, that's bullshit.
[22:02.530 --> 22:03.290]  Tell him, Geoff.
[22:04.510 --> 22:06.010]  I got all jangled up on something.
[22:07.910 --> 22:08.230]  Why?
[22:08.950 --> 22:09.870]  Let me fire!
[22:10.810 --> 22:11.130]  No.
[22:13.090 --> 22:14.010]  Eric, have a bomb.
[22:14.650 --> 22:15.230]  Gotcha, bitch!
[22:15.230 --> 22:15.970]  I had a bomb!
[22:16.650 --> 22:16.970]  Ow!
[22:18.450 --> 22:19.090]  Oh, shit!
[22:19.150 --> 22:19.750]  I bounced over the box.
[22:19.770 --> 22:20.410]  Gavin, did you have a bomb?
[22:20.850 --> 22:21.550]  Gavin, did you have a bomb?
[22:21.730 --> 22:22.150]  I had one.
[22:22.670 --> 22:23.210]  Oh, here we go.
[22:23.270 --> 22:23.550]  Here we go.
[22:23.570 --> 22:24.230]  Here we go.
[22:24.350 --> 22:25.530]  What does apples mean?
[22:26.510 --> 22:28.090]  Uh, they're wampa fruit, you moron.
[22:28.930 --> 22:29.590]  Yeah, what does it do?
[22:30.110 --> 22:30.690]  I don't know.
[22:30.770 --> 22:31.750]  I think it makes you go faster.
[22:33.110 --> 22:34.010]  Keeps you from getting scurvy.
[22:35.310 --> 22:35.630]  Yeah.
[22:35.630 --> 22:40.390]  Ooh, I did a fucking...
[22:40.390 --> 22:40.770]  Got him!
[22:40.910 --> 22:41.930]  Got him!
[22:42.270 --> 22:42.370]  Awesome.
[22:42.630 --> 22:43.170]  Wee-wee!
[22:43.270 --> 22:44.510]  Oh, he gets the big boy.
[22:45.010 --> 22:46.210]  Fuck myself up.
[22:47.790 --> 22:48.310]  Oh!
[22:49.230 --> 22:50.130]  Andrew, you lucky.
[22:50.650 --> 22:53.850]  I was invisible with a boost, and I still got hit by something.
[22:54.470 --> 22:55.270]  That's pretty cool.
[22:57.350 --> 22:59.450]  I bet that was personally frustrating for you.
[23:00.270 --> 23:01.310]  Another invisible.
[23:01.730 --> 23:02.110]  Excellent.
[23:02.650 --> 23:03.930]  Give me any weapon.
[23:03.950 --> 23:04.270]  Got him!
[23:04.670 --> 23:04.990]  Ow.
[23:04.990 --> 23:05.770]  Eric Badour's leading.
[23:06.610 --> 23:07.410]  I just want a weapon.
[23:07.590 --> 23:08.290]  Alright, that'll work.
[23:10.650 --> 23:11.390]  Oh, I slipped.
[23:13.250 --> 23:14.610]  Yeah, it's useless.
[23:18.560 --> 23:19.260]  Ah, shit.
[23:20.160 --> 23:22.980]  Any common household item can be a weapon if you're clever.
[23:23.480 --> 23:23.860]  Cool.
[23:26.460 --> 23:26.900]  Cool.
[23:28.420 --> 23:29.400]  Thanks, man.
[23:29.580 --> 23:30.140]  Yeah, thanks, dude.
[23:30.460 --> 23:31.020]  Yeah, no problem.
[23:31.560 --> 23:32.000]  That's what I'm here for.
[23:32.180 --> 23:32.540]  Oh!
[23:35.420 --> 23:35.860]  What?
[23:36.280 --> 23:37.640]  Damn it to hell, Gavin!
[23:38.340 --> 23:38.620]  What happened?
[23:39.160 --> 23:39.780]  I didn't get you.
[23:40.080 --> 23:40.980]  You just got damned to hell.
[23:41.220 --> 23:42.300]  Oh, but I did get you with that.
[23:43.120 --> 23:43.480]  Damn you.
[23:44.180 --> 23:45.860]  You just got season 7 of Supernatural'd.
[23:49.340 --> 23:49.840]  Oh, yeah.
[23:50.000 --> 23:50.320]  Here you go, Nick.
[23:51.920 --> 23:53.580]  I thought you upped the kill count.
[23:54.220 --> 23:55.440]  Oh, I left it at 5, sorry.
[23:55.620 --> 23:57.180]  Because I didn't know how the AI was going to do.
[23:57.480 --> 23:58.520]  I mean, like, without the AI.
[23:59.280 --> 24:00.280]  Now we got it.
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.200]  Now we got no AI.
[24:01.200 --> 24:02.240]  We're going to capture flags.
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.340]  It's going to go nuts.
[24:03.480 --> 24:04.200]  We're about to go nuts.
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.120]  You guys ready to go nuts?
[24:05.120 --> 24:05.560]  Yeah.
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.320]  Are you ready to go?
[24:06.600 --> 24:10.180]  Are you ready to go insane Crash Team Racing style?
[24:10.280 --> 24:12.320]  Are you ready to get CTRCTE?
[24:17.600 --> 24:18.820]  That's the title of the video.
[24:22.760 --> 24:24.320]  Let's capture the flag.
[24:27.520 --> 24:28.540]  We're going to go in.
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.540]  We're going to go in the Rampage Ruins.
[24:30.740 --> 24:31.820]  And then I think we're good.
[24:31.900 --> 24:34.500]  We're going to capture the flag and immediately go into Concussion Protocol.
[24:36.580 --> 24:38.260]  They're going to put the blue tent around us.
[24:38.260 --> 24:39.200]  It's not going to be good.
[24:39.240 --> 24:39.540]  It's in the blue tent.
[24:39.680 --> 24:39.940]  Just go.
[24:40.440 --> 24:41.780]  Ah, it's teams.
[24:42.640 --> 24:43.800]  Yeah, what did you think?
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.600]  It's capture the flag.
[24:45.060 --> 24:45.500]  It's capture the flag.
[24:45.640 --> 24:47.120]  You wanted us to only get the flag.
[24:47.400 --> 24:47.480]  Are you a moron?
[24:47.480 --> 24:48.440]  You wanted five flags?
[24:49.040 --> 24:49.440]  Are you an idiot?
[24:50.380 --> 24:50.500]  Yeah.
[24:50.960 --> 24:51.360]  Yeah?
[24:52.360 --> 24:54.380]  So who's the team of two?
[24:54.880 --> 24:55.800]  So now what?
[24:56.300 --> 24:58.000]  Well, the team of two is boned.
[24:58.440 --> 24:58.620]  Yeah.
[25:00.160 --> 25:00.760]  That's what you think.
[25:00.860 --> 25:02.940]  Should we do sports improvements tomorrow as well?
[25:03.380 --> 25:03.980]  We can.
[25:03.980 --> 25:05.000]  It's a lot of drafts.
[25:05.020 --> 25:06.120]  It's a lot of drafts.
[25:06.200 --> 25:07.760]  It is, but damn, that sounds fun.
[25:10.760 --> 25:11.560]  Oh, man.
[25:11.840 --> 25:12.820]  I was trying to get that.
[25:15.260 --> 25:16.920]  I'm going to get the flag.
[25:17.060 --> 25:17.840]  Ah, shit.
[25:18.000 --> 25:18.760]  The flag is mine.
[25:22.220 --> 25:23.300]  I got the flag.
[25:23.900 --> 25:25.260]  They stole our flag, Nick.
[25:26.260 --> 25:27.420]  I got their flag.
[25:27.780 --> 25:28.160]  Oh, sick.
[25:28.240 --> 25:28.660]  What team?
[25:28.860 --> 25:30.140]  Am I on blue or red?
[25:30.240 --> 25:30.660]  It doesn't matter.
[25:31.840 --> 25:32.280]  Who cares?
[25:32.280 --> 25:32.940]  Yeah.
[25:33.340 --> 25:34.540]  I got a flag.
[25:35.040 --> 25:36.960]  I got a pretty car with a blue flag.
[25:37.160 --> 25:38.860]  So, does the flag need to be back to score?
[25:39.760 --> 25:40.580]  Let's get the flag.
[25:40.740 --> 25:41.360]  I don't know.
[25:42.780 --> 25:44.040]  Where did my flag go?
[25:44.640 --> 25:46.580]  I shot the flag out of his hands.
[25:47.020 --> 25:47.680]  Oh, you dick.
[25:47.680 --> 25:48.020]  Nice work.
[25:48.480 --> 25:49.020]  Ah, Bob!
[25:52.760 --> 25:54.240]  I'll get the flag back.
[25:56.620 --> 25:58.820]  Yeah, you can't score until the flag is returned.
[25:59.340 --> 25:59.760]  Okay.
[26:04.510 --> 26:04.770]  Okay.
[26:05.150 --> 26:05.710]  Okay.
[26:06.270 --> 26:06.610]  Okay.
[26:07.350 --> 26:07.750]  Okay.
[26:10.670 --> 26:11.230]  Ow!
[26:11.790 --> 26:13.590]  I don't know if I'm on a team with you, Gavin.
[26:14.830 --> 26:15.730]  You aren't.
[26:16.230 --> 26:18.370]  What color is my thing above me?
[26:20.250 --> 26:21.370]  Am I blue or red?
[26:21.750 --> 26:21.970]  Yeah.
[26:22.470 --> 26:22.790]  Yeah.
[26:23.470 --> 26:23.750]  Yeah.
[26:24.610 --> 26:25.550]  I assume...
[26:25.550 --> 26:26.090]  Am I red?
[26:26.130 --> 26:26.790]  I think I'm red.
[26:26.950 --> 26:27.430]  Yeah.
[26:28.090 --> 26:28.330]  Yeah.
[26:29.930 --> 26:30.590]  Of course.
[26:31.090 --> 26:32.590]  Where's the red flag?
[26:33.210 --> 26:33.910]  Oh, it's over there.
[26:33.910 --> 26:35.310]  I think Nick's got it.
[26:35.310 --> 26:36.110]  I'm going for you!
[26:37.530 --> 26:38.670]  Red team dropped a flag.
[26:38.670 --> 26:40.610]  Dropped a flag, and that's good?
[26:41.050 --> 26:41.810]  I think so.
[26:42.090 --> 26:42.610]  Kill Andrew!
[26:42.930 --> 26:43.330]  Kill him!
[26:44.310 --> 26:44.690]  Yeah, okay.
[26:44.750 --> 26:45.270]  Ride the flag!
[26:46.890 --> 26:48.210]  Does Geoff have a flag?
[26:48.910 --> 26:49.890]  Who has the flag?
[26:50.490 --> 26:51.890]  Whose team am I on?
[26:52.230 --> 26:52.850]  Somebody score!
[26:53.270 --> 26:56.010]  What kind of fucking stupid-ass game is this?
[26:56.010 --> 26:56.690]  Somebody score!
[26:57.970 --> 27:00.150]  Geoff is just driving around with the blue flag!
[27:00.350 --> 27:01.450]  Geoff, you'll score it!
[27:01.590 --> 27:02.410]  Red team flag.
[27:02.470 --> 27:03.650]  Go, Gavin, go!
[27:05.310 --> 27:06.270]  Red team flag is stolen.
[27:06.270 --> 27:08.290]  No, we can't score it now that the flag is gone!
[27:09.610 --> 27:10.790]  Come back here, Gavin!
[27:12.270 --> 27:13.210]  Run, Gavin, run!
[27:13.810 --> 27:15.550]  I'm getting it, I'm getting it, I'm getting it!
[27:16.310 --> 27:17.690]  Geoff, go score the flag!
[27:17.950 --> 27:19.210]  Geoff, you're in their base!
[27:19.490 --> 27:20.450]  What are you doing, Geoff?
[27:21.610 --> 27:24.190]  I have the red flag now.
[27:24.230 --> 27:24.630]  Shit!
[27:24.630 --> 27:25.310]  It's stolen?
[27:25.770 --> 27:26.830]  Do I have to take it to blue?
[27:27.150 --> 27:29.770]  Yeah, you have to take the red flag to blue.
[27:30.710 --> 27:32.710]  Somebody get the blue flag off Geoff!
[27:33.490 --> 27:35.330]  No, I gotta go back and get it, I just dropped it.
[27:36.110 --> 27:38.170]  Oh, so the blue flag's back at base?
[27:38.570 --> 27:39.130]  Not yet!
[27:39.290 --> 27:40.150]  No, Geoff!
[27:40.750 --> 27:42.290]  Nick, get our flag back, Nick!
[27:42.430 --> 27:43.990]  I'm working on it, I'm working on it, I'm working on it!
[27:44.690 --> 27:47.270]  Alright, I'm gonna go score now, but you gotta get them to drop the flag.
[27:47.270 --> 27:48.950]  Uh, you're not, because Gavin's got the-
[27:48.950 --> 27:49.730]  No, I don't.
[27:49.970 --> 27:50.350]  Oh, right.
[27:52.130 --> 27:53.610]  Whose team am I on?
[27:55.190 --> 27:56.250]  Alright, I didn't score.
[27:57.530 --> 27:59.570]  How are you alive? I shot you!
[27:59.730 --> 28:00.750]  What is this bullshit?
[28:00.930 --> 28:01.890]  Did you shoot me?
[28:01.890 --> 28:03.750]  I got it, I got it, Gavin, I got it!
[28:04.070 --> 28:04.530]  Yes!
[28:05.250 --> 28:05.570]  No!
[28:06.190 --> 28:06.830]  I blew up Andrew.
[28:07.570 --> 28:08.990]  I couldn't figure out how to reverse.
[28:10.390 --> 28:10.870]  No!
[28:12.890 --> 28:14.150]  This game's so stupid.
[28:14.710 --> 28:15.570]  Did I win?
[28:15.870 --> 28:16.230]  No.
[28:16.430 --> 28:17.490]  Oh, I was on red team.
[28:23.470 --> 28:26.090]  I just kinda drove around in circles.
[28:29.370 --> 28:32.210]  The editor doesn't need to use any of my footage for that part.
[28:32.330 --> 28:35.110]  I was like, nothing happened.
[28:35.330 --> 28:37.090]  Maybe you were a great cameraman of all the action.
[28:37.470 --> 28:38.310]  I don't-
[28:38.310 --> 28:39.410]  I don't think so.
[28:40.770 --> 28:41.470]  I doubt it.
[28:41.710 --> 28:44.750]  I doubt a non-team-based game we can play.
[28:45.130 --> 28:46.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's see.
[28:47.130 --> 28:47.850]  Oh, man.
[28:48.030 --> 28:48.910]  Last cart driving.
[28:49.270 --> 28:49.690]  Yes!
[28:50.350 --> 28:51.410]  Three minutes, no AI.
[28:51.530 --> 28:52.070]  Alright, go ahead.
[28:52.490 --> 28:53.610]  We're going to Temple Turmoil.
[28:53.870 --> 28:56.070]  Now, I don't think I'm gonna be on anyone's team for this.
[28:57.310 --> 28:58.190]  I'm ready.
[28:58.690 --> 29:02.490]  Well, you really weren't on anyone's team last time.
[29:02.690 --> 29:03.330]  The way you played.
[29:05.130 --> 29:06.390]  But I made it.
[29:06.490 --> 29:07.390]  You know, it was interesting.
[29:07.510 --> 29:10.130]  Because then it was like, at least these are even teams maybe.
[29:17.690 --> 29:18.570]  Temple Turmoil.
[29:19.990 --> 29:21.770]  Oh, the moon's pissed.
[29:22.570 --> 29:23.110]  Oh, is it?
[29:23.750 --> 29:25.490]  Oh, it's so grumpy.
[29:25.490 --> 29:26.070]  It's a vampire moon.
[29:26.070 --> 29:30.010]  What if we did a video where we pick the angriest moons in video games?
[29:30.950 --> 29:32.350]  Oh, Majora's Mask takes the cake.
[29:36.590 --> 29:40.010]  Do you ever play Wiz and Liz?
[29:40.790 --> 29:40.950]  Yeah.
[29:42.850 --> 29:43.890]  Everybody plays Wiz and Liz.
[29:43.890 --> 29:44.410]  Every day, man.
[29:44.770 --> 29:47.290]  The moon would be asleep, and then it would wake up and look real pissed.
[29:47.290 --> 29:48.950]  And then it would wake up and look real angry.
[29:49.430 --> 29:51.130]  My friends would be like, hey, you wanna come over?
[29:51.190 --> 29:52.690]  And I'd say, nah, I'm Wiz and Liz-ing today.
[29:53.010 --> 29:53.390]  Can't do it.
[29:53.870 --> 29:54.230]  Gavin.
[29:56.010 --> 29:56.710]  Oh, that's me!
[29:56.830 --> 29:58.550]  Gavin, I think they're making fun of you.
[29:58.710 --> 29:59.110]  I think so.
[29:59.290 --> 30:02.430]  And then sometimes you could blow the sunflower's nose off.
[30:02.510 --> 30:03.330]  Right off his face.
[30:03.330 --> 30:04.470]  Oh, yeah, the sunflower.
[30:04.830 --> 30:05.990]  His eyes would pop out.
[30:06.330 --> 30:06.650]  Oh, man.
[30:07.090 --> 30:07.610]  Did I get you, Eric?
[30:07.630 --> 30:08.270]  That's some shit, Wiz and Liz.
[30:08.450 --> 30:09.470]  I think I got me.
[30:09.990 --> 30:11.590]  Either way, I lost a life.
[30:11.930 --> 30:12.630]  Oh, my God.
[30:12.710 --> 30:13.210]  I'm throwing a bomb.
[30:14.990 --> 30:17.430]  There's something we're missing with these fruit things.
[30:17.890 --> 30:18.570]  Or realism.
[30:18.810 --> 30:20.470]  Well, I think they just make you go faster.
[30:21.030 --> 30:21.290]  Do they?
[30:21.390 --> 30:22.530]  I don't know how to redeem them.
[30:22.530 --> 30:23.530]  I guess that's my problem.
[30:23.810 --> 30:24.850]  I don't think there's a redemption.
[30:24.990 --> 30:26.050]  I think they're coins in Mario.
[30:26.350 --> 30:28.310]  Is this a remake of Wizard and Halo?
[30:30.310 --> 30:31.790]  Oh, it kind of does remind me.
[30:31.870 --> 30:32.210]  Yeah.
[30:32.730 --> 30:33.710]  Can we play Halo?
[30:34.610 --> 30:36.350]  Yeah, this is a Wizard-Lizard level.
[30:36.570 --> 30:37.170]  It's kind of like Halo.
[30:38.110 --> 30:39.790]  I mean, yeah.
[30:40.650 --> 30:41.510]  They both have vehicles.
[30:43.330 --> 30:44.570]  I'm Meowster Chief.
[30:45.590 --> 30:46.210]  Who did that?
[30:46.750 --> 30:47.410]  That was me.
[30:49.750 --> 30:50.230]  What?
[30:50.950 --> 30:51.890]  Are you okay?
[30:51.890 --> 30:52.570]  Mystery solved.
[30:52.570 --> 30:54.050]  He knocked his words out, dude.
[30:55.030 --> 30:55.330]  What?
[30:58.210 --> 30:59.890]  I watched Gavin die.
[31:00.630 --> 31:01.050]  I love it.
[31:01.190 --> 31:01.890]  Oh, no.
[31:01.890 --> 31:03.010]  I only have one life now.
[31:03.330 --> 31:04.090]  Did Gavin cut his mic?
[31:04.730 --> 31:07.770]  I thought I could win by just hiding and not getting involved.
[31:07.770 --> 31:08.930]  He was hiding in the corner.
[31:09.150 --> 31:09.850]  Oh, no.
[31:09.950 --> 31:10.890]  I'm getting locked behind.
[31:11.470 --> 31:12.990]  Now my screen just says, what happened?
[31:13.070 --> 31:14.110]  And I'm staring at the ground.
[31:14.530 --> 31:15.970]  Mine says insurance risk.
[31:16.530 --> 31:17.990]  Oh, I just ran into a thing.
[31:18.230 --> 31:19.730]  I didn't even have to do anything.
[31:20.090 --> 31:20.210]  Nick won.
[31:20.210 --> 31:20.830]  I win.
[31:21.210 --> 31:22.610]  Hey, Nick, do you feel like a real winner?
[31:22.990 --> 31:23.250]  No.
[31:26.410 --> 31:27.670]  Well, you know who was a winner?
[31:27.910 --> 31:29.810]  My dad in a Home Depot parking lot.
[31:30.070 --> 31:31.930]  This has been Crash Team Racing.
[31:32.430 --> 31:34.030]  Thank you so much for watching us drive.
[31:34.830 --> 31:36.050]  We have other Let's Play content.
[31:36.150 --> 31:36.630]  We have a Patreon.
[31:37.390 --> 31:39.270]  We'll be back with a different video soon.
[31:39.610 --> 31:40.410]  Have a great rest of your day.
[31:40.690 --> 31:40.910]  Goodbye.
[31:41.410 --> 31:42.530]  I don't know why you're muting the game.
[31:42.590 --> 31:43.190]  It's not over.
[31:43.790 --> 31:44.710]  We're playing one more.
[31:46.510 --> 31:47.010]  We are?
[31:47.550 --> 31:47.810]  Yeah.
[31:48.270 --> 31:49.270]  Look, it's loading up.
[31:49.270 --> 31:50.270]  We're playing one more.
[31:50.490 --> 31:51.550]  I don't know why we synced.
[31:51.610 --> 31:52.510]  I don't know why we did all that.
[31:52.710 --> 31:53.510]  That video wasn't long enough.
[31:53.630 --> 31:54.270]  We gotta do one more.
[31:54.750 --> 31:56.030]  Yeah, that's what you think.
[31:56.690 --> 31:57.850]  But we got Temple Turmoil.
[31:58.670 --> 32:00.090]  Guys, it's first to ten points.
[32:00.190 --> 32:00.630]  This is it.
[32:01.070 --> 32:02.910]  Once again, my game.
[32:03.670 --> 32:04.390]  My game.
[32:05.210 --> 32:06.270]  This is my game.
[32:07.030 --> 32:08.150]  You don't want to own it.
[32:08.230 --> 32:08.750]  I'll own it.
[32:09.130 --> 32:09.770]  It's Eric's game.
[32:10.550 --> 32:10.770]  Yeah.
[32:11.710 --> 32:12.690]  First to ten points.
[32:12.770 --> 32:13.570]  This is for all the marbles.
[32:13.690 --> 32:16.770]  This is to see who the CTRCTE champion is.
[32:16.770 --> 32:22.590]  Should we have literal marbles that we have to give each other when we lose and see who can collect all the marbles?
[32:22.630 --> 32:23.350]  Oh, it's like Squid Game.
[32:26.470 --> 32:27.530]  Am I dead?
[32:27.650 --> 32:32.210]  And then when somebody declares this for all the marbles, it takes on a whole different meaning for us.
[32:32.270 --> 32:34.650]  We're like, oh fuck, marbles are on the line.
[32:35.310 --> 32:36.790]  It suddenly becomes a marble match.
[32:37.290 --> 32:38.410]  Uh-oh, I lost my marbles.
[32:40.230 --> 32:41.590]  Ooh, Gavin is leading?
[32:41.910 --> 32:43.030]  I shot Andrew's buns.
[32:43.590 --> 32:44.410]  Look at this, right?
[32:44.470 --> 32:45.610]  Oh, the video's over.
[32:45.610 --> 32:46.250]  The video's over.
[32:46.350 --> 32:46.950]  Look at you.
[32:47.550 --> 32:50.250]  Like a phoenix from the ashes, Gavin sucks.
[32:51.810 --> 32:52.630]  Gavin's back.
[32:52.870 --> 32:53.250]  Gavin's back.
[32:53.350 --> 32:54.530]  That's what I meant to say.
[33:00.900 --> 33:02.600]  Stupid papaya things.
[33:03.580 --> 33:10.140]  In mythology, has a phoenix ever risen with another phoenix's cock in its mouth?
[33:11.620 --> 33:12.980]  What the fuck?
[33:13.800 --> 33:16.100]  Somebody was in my dreams last night.
[33:17.300 --> 33:19.360]  Somebody inception me.
[33:24.060 --> 33:25.260]  Oh, man.
[33:25.260 --> 33:26.340]  It's just like, oh!
[33:28.540 --> 33:29.360]  Got him.
[33:33.080 --> 33:36.120]  He's getting all hot and bothered about this phoenix cock situation.
[33:37.020 --> 33:38.280]  Like a phoenix.
[33:39.580 --> 33:40.940]  A phoenix penis.
[33:44.880 --> 33:49.160]  See, we never would have had that if you guys just ended the video.
[33:49.320 --> 33:49.900]  How boring.
[33:50.080 --> 33:51.320]  We got one more in us.
[33:51.560 --> 33:52.880]  That's what I'm talking about.
[33:54.260 --> 33:55.120]  What does this do?
[33:56.500 --> 33:56.940]  Damn it!
[33:57.920 --> 33:59.460]  Hey, don't say my name.
[34:01.860 --> 34:02.460]  No, leave me be.
[34:03.960 --> 34:04.660]  I'm a good guy.
[34:05.940 --> 34:07.180]  Are there bad guys?
[34:07.540 --> 34:08.420]  That's what I tell my team.
[34:08.580 --> 34:08.920]  I'm a good guy.
[34:09.000 --> 34:10.040]  I'm a good guy.
[34:10.900 --> 34:13.440]  I don't want the crappy IMs.
[34:15.860 --> 34:18.120]  You worthless shitlord.
[34:19.960 --> 34:20.260]  Shitlord.
[34:21.720 --> 34:24.780]  Merry Christmas or whatever the fuck Nick usually says.
[34:25.080 --> 34:30.380]  Boy, Nick went from God bless the United States of America, dang it, to worthless shitlord.
[34:30.680 --> 34:30.840]  Yep.
[34:31.200 --> 34:32.700]  Well, yeah.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.780]  Somebody's had a long week already.
[34:36.980 --> 34:37.320]  Yeah, dude.
[34:37.400 --> 34:38.760]  You're getting everything in front of me.
[34:38.760 --> 34:40.520]  My kid was home sick for two days.
[34:41.860 --> 34:42.820]  Kids are the worst.
[34:43.580 --> 34:44.640]  Let's take them out together.
[34:45.760 --> 34:46.300]  Got him.
[34:46.560 --> 34:47.740]  It's so true.
[34:48.160 --> 34:48.800]  They really are.
[34:49.340 --> 34:51.100]  And I can say that as a parent.
[34:51.380 --> 34:52.540]  Yeah, as a parent you can say it.
[34:52.560 --> 34:53.760]  Yeah, Gavin can't say that.
[34:53.900 --> 34:54.320]  Kids suck.
[34:54.700 --> 34:55.280]  I'm not a parent.
[34:55.620 --> 34:56.660]  Oh shit, I'm going to jail.
[34:57.860 --> 34:59.160]  I'm going to jail.
[34:59.900 --> 35:03.020]  If you go to jail for anything, it's going to be for kicking the kids, not insulting them.
[35:03.420 --> 35:03.740]  Allegedly.
[35:06.140 --> 35:07.740]  He's just screaming that on the stand.
[35:07.740 --> 35:08.240]  Allegedly.
[35:08.680 --> 35:09.120]  Allegedly.
[35:09.340 --> 35:10.260]  Tell that to the families.
[35:11.300 --> 35:11.980]  I will.
[35:15.820 --> 35:16.740]  Steal it from me, Nick.
[35:17.220 --> 35:18.720]  Oh no, it was a bomb.
[35:18.940 --> 35:19.420]  It was fake.
[35:19.640 --> 35:20.260]  It was a fake.
[35:20.540 --> 35:21.560]  It was TNT, bitch.
[35:22.260 --> 35:24.940]  It was TNT, bitch.
[35:26.760 --> 35:27.340]  Got him.
[35:28.820 --> 35:29.300]  I'm at seven.
[35:29.300 --> 35:29.740]  That's for Gavin.
[35:30.200 --> 35:31.040]  I'm at two.
[35:32.900 --> 35:33.100]  Bomb.
[35:33.740 --> 35:34.720]  Did I get anyone?
[35:35.440 --> 35:36.920]  How many kills do you have?
[35:37.060 --> 35:38.200]  There's like no indication apart from the number going up.
[35:38.920 --> 35:39.920]  Well, we go up.
[35:40.380 --> 35:40.700]  Right.
[35:41.220 --> 35:43.160]  There's no indication other than the indicator.
[35:43.160 --> 35:46.220]  Shouldn't there be like a point come up or something?
[35:47.820 --> 35:50.820]  I fucking hope not.
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.580]  Oh, I shot Andrew's invisible ass.
[35:55.080 --> 35:55.480]  Bomb.
[35:56.840 --> 35:57.820]  Shit, I missed.
[35:58.520 --> 36:01.360]  It's real embarrassing when you miss and you're both driving in the same direction.
[36:01.500 --> 36:02.320]  You just watch it go.
[36:03.860 --> 36:04.460]  I'm at four.
[36:05.440 --> 36:06.120]  I got seven.
[36:06.520 --> 36:06.660]  Eight.
[36:07.420 --> 36:07.720]  Seven.
[36:08.440 --> 36:08.900]  Fuck!
[36:11.200 --> 36:11.680]  No!
[36:12.600 --> 36:12.680]  Geoff wins!
[36:13.140 --> 36:13.520]  Double kill?
[36:14.100 --> 36:14.580]  Wow!
[36:14.580 --> 36:15.420]  I got a double kill.
[36:15.480 --> 36:15.920]  What?
[36:16.200 --> 36:17.560]  What an ending.
[36:18.140 --> 36:19.120]  What an ending.
[36:19.320 --> 36:21.020]  Guys, check out the Patreon.
[36:21.240 --> 36:22.580]  Check out the other Let's Play content.

[36:26.900 --> 36:27.620]  Incredible stuff.
