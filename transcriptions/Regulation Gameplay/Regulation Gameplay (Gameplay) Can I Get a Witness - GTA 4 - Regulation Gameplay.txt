[00:00.000 --> 00:01.100]  I guess we just go, right?
[00:01.680 --> 00:05.440]  Yeah. I think we should probably, like, introduce the video and then, like, start it, yeah.
[00:05.500 --> 00:06.940]  Oh, is that how this works? Oh, yeah, Andrew, go.
[00:08.440 --> 00:12.400]  Hello, welcome to a thing that I don't know anything about, but apparently Geoff and Gavin played a lot of this.
[00:12.480 --> 00:13.580]  This is called Lone Wolf Bikers.
[00:14.020 --> 00:17.080]  I don't think we played a lot of it, but I remember playing it once. It was fun.
[00:19.780 --> 00:21.180]  Story keeps changing, doesn't it?
[00:21.180 --> 00:23.300]  Yes, it does. Man, it really does.
[00:24.060 --> 00:24.760]  Hey, I've ready to go.
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.880]  Can you suggest this, Gavin?
[00:26.380 --> 00:26.920]  Yeah, big time.
[00:27.800 --> 00:33.060]  Uh, we went through a lot of work this morning to make this happen because Gavin loved this game type so much that he played it once.
[00:33.700 --> 00:37.000]  Well, we should stop playing a PC because this is hideous.
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.300]  What's happening?
[00:38.560 --> 00:38.800]  That looks great.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.620]  All right, how do I shoot?
[00:41.720 --> 00:42.900]  How do I shoot the gun?
[00:43.440 --> 00:43.940]  Left bumper.
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.260]  What's the draw distance?
[00:45.960 --> 00:46.220]  Ah!
[00:46.420 --> 00:46.680]  Two.
[00:47.960 --> 00:48.580]  Why are you drawing?
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.020]  Gotta go to the checkpoints.
[00:51.760 --> 00:52.080]  Ah!
[00:52.900 --> 00:54.740]  God, why do you like this?
[00:54.760 --> 00:55.620]  I'm the Lone Wolf Biker!
[00:55.620 --> 00:57.080]  Oh, the Lone Wolf Biker.
[00:57.140 --> 00:58.860]  I'm a Lone Wolf Biker!
[01:01.140 --> 01:03.860]  Hey, Gavin, what is there to like about this?
[01:04.100 --> 01:04.400]  Ah!
[01:05.220 --> 01:06.060]  Kill him!
[01:06.420 --> 01:09.260]  Andrew's in such a fucking mood today. I am so here for this.
[01:09.260 --> 01:12.200]  It's so weird. He's just on one.
[01:12.360 --> 01:13.300]  Did you forget your meds today?
[01:13.680 --> 01:15.020]  Hey, I think Andrew woke up feeling good.
[01:15.020 --> 01:16.160]  I doubled them down.
[01:18.220 --> 01:18.740]  Ah!
[01:18.940 --> 01:19.120]  Oh!
[01:19.320 --> 01:19.700]  Get it, Nick!
[01:20.100 --> 01:21.620]  Gavin, you're killing me, man!
[01:22.020 --> 01:24.240]  Not killing me, the Lone Wolf Biker!
[01:24.460 --> 01:25.340]  I don't understand.
[01:25.340 --> 01:27.940]  Gavin said that he liked this, and I don't...
[01:27.940 --> 01:31.380]  Oh, that's right. He likes the, like, the car physics in this game.
[01:31.500 --> 01:32.260]  Well, this isn't a car.
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.780]  This controls like shit.
[01:34.940 --> 01:35.680]  Oh, shit.
[01:35.800 --> 01:36.580]  That's pretty rough.
[01:37.340 --> 01:38.260]  What is this L?
[01:38.820 --> 01:39.540]  Oh, shit.
[01:39.800 --> 01:40.320]  He's down there.
[01:40.520 --> 01:40.920]  Oh!
[01:43.500 --> 01:45.820]  Wait, why am I the Lone Wolf Biker?
[01:46.080 --> 01:48.680]  Because I died as the Lone Wolf Biker.
[01:51.080 --> 01:51.740]  How do I drown?
[01:51.900 --> 01:54.500]  This game is so gray and ugly.
[01:54.700 --> 01:55.080]  Swim downward.
[01:55.980 --> 01:58.120]  Oh, shit, that was pretty cool, though.
[01:58.120 --> 01:58.600]  Thanks, man.
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.960]  Oh, I didn't make the next one!
[02:00.140 --> 02:00.580]  How'd I...
[02:00.580 --> 02:02.520]  Oh, no! I'm taking a nap!
[02:02.940 --> 02:03.920]  Ah, I fell off!
[02:04.180 --> 02:05.620]  I fell off! Lone Wolf Walker!
[02:05.980 --> 02:06.820]  Lone Wolf Walker!
[02:08.680 --> 02:10.280]  Where are you, Lone Wolf Walker?
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.080]  No, Lone Wolf!
[02:12.520 --> 02:14.480]  How much back do... how much... what?
[02:15.700 --> 02:16.140]  What?
[02:16.360 --> 02:17.720]  What did you just say?
[02:18.360 --> 02:19.300]  How much back to what?
[02:19.580 --> 02:21.460]  I was trying to ask how many bullets this bat could take.
[02:21.540 --> 02:22.260]  It didn't come out that way.
[02:22.980 --> 02:24.040]  It's me, I'm the guy!
[02:24.120 --> 02:24.700]  No, it did not.
[02:24.700 --> 02:26.180]  How much back to bullet, eh?
[02:26.380 --> 02:27.940]  How much back to bullet's back.
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.860]  Dude, I'm holding eight!
[02:32.960 --> 02:33.520]  Andrew, no!
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.260]  I didn't kill... oh, now I'm underwater.
[02:35.380 --> 02:35.920]  I didn't kill myself.
[02:36.220 --> 02:36.840]  Drown, dude.
[02:36.860 --> 02:37.140]  Shit.
[02:37.940 --> 02:38.780]  How do you drown in this game?
[02:38.780 --> 02:40.700]  Tell me... tell me how you do it, because I can't...
[02:41.460 --> 02:42.300]  What? How?
[02:43.400 --> 02:45.100]  Let's figure out how to get there.
[02:45.480 --> 02:46.340]  How to die.
[02:46.360 --> 02:47.540]  You need to figure out how to get a vehicle.
[02:48.480 --> 02:49.380]  How to die.
[02:49.680 --> 02:50.520]  You start on a bike.
[02:51.540 --> 02:52.600]  I just want to die.
[02:52.700 --> 02:53.400]  I don't know if you can.
[02:53.960 --> 02:54.800]  Do you have a grenade?
[02:56.820 --> 02:58.360]  Let me swim back to the shore.
[02:58.740 --> 02:59.400]  I can't get up.
[02:59.700 --> 03:01.860]  In this game, it looks like you have to shit so bad.
[03:03.340 --> 03:03.980]  Fucking suicide?
[03:04.880 --> 03:05.200]  No.
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.580]  Are you guys stuck in the water?
[03:08.980 --> 03:09.520]  Let's go get them.
[03:09.600 --> 03:10.680]  They were. I don't know what they're doing.
[03:10.820 --> 03:11.300]  I just ran down.
[03:11.400 --> 03:12.440]  I don't know why they're still down there.
[03:13.620 --> 03:15.640]  The bike is gone, so what am I going to do?
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.460]  Get in a vehicle.
[03:17.060 --> 03:17.620]  Yeah, get on a bike.
[03:18.820 --> 03:21.620]  Go to the street, and then get a car, and then go.
[03:21.620 --> 03:24.220]  I mean, in fairness to me, I've not sailed out of this car.
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.460]  Driving one.
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.560]  Well, thanks for trying to defend me.
[03:28.700 --> 03:30.520]  This game sucks.
[03:31.320 --> 03:33.040]  I hate the way this controls.
[03:33.240 --> 03:33.880]  This is awful.
[03:34.660 --> 03:35.540]  Gavin, why'd you...
[03:36.380 --> 03:38.140]  Gavin, why'd you have us play on the Xbox?
[03:41.660 --> 03:43.840]  Don't you think this would have looked better on the PC?
[03:44.520 --> 03:46.060]  Yeah, I don't know why you insisted.
[03:47.940 --> 03:51.300]  Some of us had to install it on one anyway.
[03:51.300 --> 03:54.880]  It would have been just as easy to do PC.
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.840]  Really wish we'd thought about that.
[03:57.920 --> 03:58.540]  Oh, well, next time.
[04:00.020 --> 04:01.560]  It's okay, Gavin, you're still learning.
[04:02.100 --> 04:02.620]  We're still learning.
[04:05.380 --> 04:08.840]  What are you supposed to do as the lone wolf biker?
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.540]  I was the lone wolf biker.
[04:13.780 --> 04:15.380]  Is this a pipe bomb?
[04:16.360 --> 04:17.720]  How do I turn the music off?
[04:18.780 --> 04:19.800]  Lone wolf biker!
[04:21.120 --> 04:21.840]  Oh, shit.
[04:24.500 --> 04:25.680]  Coming after you.
[04:26.680 --> 04:28.060]  I'm the lone wolf biker.
[04:28.540 --> 04:29.480]  I don't want that.
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.520]  I don't want this view.
[04:31.620 --> 04:32.280]  Okay, thank you.
[04:32.900 --> 04:33.800]  I turned the music off.
[04:34.060 --> 04:36.020]  I don't know how you turn the music off.
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.380]  Go to audio.
[04:37.760 --> 04:38.340]  No, I'm not doing that.
[04:38.460 --> 04:39.020]  No, no.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  Hey, no dice.
[04:40.860 --> 04:41.340]  All right, sweet.
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.540]  Don't cut to Eric's audio.
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.420]  Yeah, don't use my audio.
[04:44.460 --> 04:44.820]  I don't care.
[04:46.100 --> 04:47.640]  I'm the lone wolf biker, baby.
[04:47.720 --> 04:48.540]  It don't matter to me.
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.480]  Oh, there's...
[04:51.480 --> 04:53.080]  Oh, the yellow things that...
[04:53.080 --> 04:54.340]  Oh, I didn't know there were checkpoints.
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.760]  I didn't understand any of this.
[04:57.360 --> 04:58.480]  We got to stop him.
[04:59.280 --> 05:00.600]  Who said there was a fog?
[05:02.500 --> 05:03.080]  Probably Geoff.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.740]  I mean, we all join a random lobby, right?
[05:05.040 --> 05:05.300]  That's true.
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.220]  I think the game said it.
[05:07.640 --> 05:08.960]  Whose random lobby was it, though?
[05:09.680 --> 05:09.960]  Geoff's.
[05:09.960 --> 05:12.280]  I mean, I was in it first, but I wouldn't say it's my lobby.
[05:12.280 --> 05:12.940]  See, so it's...
[05:12.940 --> 05:13.560]  Okay, so it's Geoff.
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.920]  Okay, I answered the questions, Geoff.
[05:16.620 --> 05:17.020]  It's a...
[05:17.020 --> 05:18.460]  It was a lobby and I was in it.
[05:20.020 --> 05:21.960]  I'm just driving around a construction site.
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.140]  Ah, people!
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.580]  There's been no need to look at my screen for a very long time.
[05:30.260 --> 05:32.900]  Well, you don't know that because you don't know what the rest of us were doing.
[05:33.880 --> 05:36.480]  They can't have been more productive or less productive.
[05:36.520 --> 05:37.260]  Well, Eric's...
[05:37.260 --> 05:38.020]  Lone wolf biker!
[05:39.740 --> 05:41.200]  Why would you die?
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.080]  Die!
[05:44.800 --> 05:45.840]  Come on!
[05:46.480 --> 05:48.280]  I sense Eric is close.
[05:48.280 --> 05:49.520]  I must...
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.700]  Lone wolf biker!
[05:52.460 --> 05:54.100]  This game type sucks!
[05:57.260 --> 05:58.880]  I'm gonna kill you, Eric.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.120]  There's so many cars!
[06:01.080 --> 06:02.460]  You gotta kill him!
[06:02.480 --> 06:03.380]  He's come back around!
[06:03.800 --> 06:04.680]  Oh, he got me!
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.700]  You gotta create one of these every once in a while just so you can be reminded that they can't all be home runs.
[06:11.020 --> 06:11.220]  Yep.
[06:14.040 --> 06:16.520]  I'm blocking him, blocking him, blocking him, I'm blocking him!
[06:19.420 --> 06:20.140]  Get me outta here!
[06:20.480 --> 06:21.000]  Anyone but Eric.
[06:22.500 --> 06:25.820]  We can't have a lone wolf biker the whole video that we can't use their footage for.
[06:30.140 --> 06:30.500]  Eric.
[06:30.740 --> 06:30.960]  Yeah?
[06:31.760 --> 06:33.460]  Let me run him down, then you finish the job.
[06:33.640 --> 06:35.900]  Now, you know what's a good game type, Gavin, is witness protection.
[06:35.900 --> 06:36.260]  GAVIN!
[06:36.760 --> 06:37.880]  That one was fun.
[06:38.440 --> 06:39.100]  And chopper versus chopper.
[06:39.100 --> 06:39.360]  No!
[06:40.140 --> 06:40.980]  And chopper versus chopper.
[06:41.100 --> 06:42.180]  So we can, uh...
[06:42.180 --> 06:43.560]  We can move on from this to...
[06:43.560 --> 06:44.820]  Come get your motorcycle, Gavin!
[06:44.960 --> 06:45.460]  Yeah, we'll pivot.
[06:46.040 --> 06:46.560]  Yeah, we'll pivot.
[06:46.860 --> 06:47.460]  Where are you?
[06:47.460 --> 06:49.600]  I think he jumped, he jumped, he jumped down.
[06:50.840 --> 06:51.740]  But it says up.
[06:52.740 --> 06:53.840]  No, he didn't, he's on the other side.
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.840]  I know, he jumped down.
[06:55.540 --> 06:56.060]  You gotta get him.
[06:58.440 --> 06:59.080]  Oh, Jesus.
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.360]  Mo down.
[07:02.320 --> 07:02.640]  No!
[07:04.300 --> 07:04.620]  Shit.
[07:04.880 --> 07:05.400]  Oh, shit.
[07:05.960 --> 07:07.360]  Is this the lone wolf biker right here?
[07:09.860 --> 07:11.140]  Were you guys talking about the...
[07:11.140 --> 07:11.720]  Get away from me!
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.080]  Now, hang on, are you guys talking about the lone wolf biker over there?
[07:14.380 --> 07:14.460]  No!
[07:15.560 --> 07:16.400]  Goddamn, come back!
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.220]  I'm neither lone nor wolf.
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.220]  Please, sir.
[07:20.400 --> 07:20.820]  Barely a bike.
[07:21.020 --> 07:23.400]  Andrew, can you do your lone wolf biker howl?
[07:26.460 --> 07:28.400]  Oh, so no, you can't?
[07:28.720 --> 07:28.880]  No.
[07:32.020 --> 07:36.540]  Hey guys, I think the lone wolf has a splinter in his paw.
[07:38.300 --> 07:39.560]  He sounds miserable.
[07:42.360 --> 07:45.240]  The lone wolf biker needs an oil change.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.620]  That's what the lone wolf biker needs.
[07:46.700 --> 07:47.500]  Did you become a pirate?
[07:47.700 --> 07:47.960]  What the fuck?
[07:47.960 --> 07:50.040]  I'm the lone wolf biker.
[07:51.080 --> 07:53.160]  That's what he thinks bikers sound like.
[07:53.320 --> 07:58.040]  Oh, you're alive!
[07:58.100 --> 07:59.040]  Lone wolf driver!
[08:01.080 --> 08:02.140]  Please, die!
[08:03.200 --> 08:03.960]  It's Andrew.
[08:05.720 --> 08:06.840]  It's not me.
[08:07.120 --> 08:08.840]  I am not the lone wolf biker.
[08:10.660 --> 08:12.000]  Please, die!
[08:12.560 --> 08:13.120]  Goddamn you.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.800]  What do you guys think Geoff has been up to?
[08:15.620 --> 08:17.000]  I'm just driving around.
[08:17.400 --> 08:19.640]  I'd like to believe he's still in the water somewhere.
[08:19.900 --> 08:20.460]  Nick!
[08:20.740 --> 08:22.640]  Train to God's Sea!
[08:25.160 --> 08:25.600]  Gavin!
[08:27.620 --> 08:29.280]  That's friendly fire, guys.
[08:30.700 --> 08:32.080]  Gavin, you...
[08:34.840 --> 08:36.560]  You couldn't kill him.
[08:36.640 --> 08:37.300]  Go, go, go, go.
[08:37.680 --> 08:39.840]  You couldn't kill him, but you killed me.
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.640]  I didn't mean to. I don't think...
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.320]  I don't think...
[08:43.320 --> 08:43.440]  Fuck!
[08:44.540 --> 08:44.940]  Nick!
[08:47.840 --> 08:48.640]  Get up!
[08:48.820 --> 08:49.660]  Lone wolf!
[08:53.420 --> 08:54.560]  Oh, hey Geoff. What's up?
[08:54.600 --> 08:55.420]  Hey, what's up man?
[08:55.940 --> 08:56.880]  Hey, we made it, man.
[08:57.540 --> 08:58.140]  Oh, shit.
[08:58.140 --> 08:59.400]  Hey, welcome to the video, Geoff.
[08:59.700 --> 09:00.860]  I found some wool. I found...
[09:00.860 --> 09:01.420]  Oh, shit.
[09:01.540 --> 09:02.380]  Oh, shit, Geoff.
[09:03.300 --> 09:05.800]  Yeah, that's rough.
[09:09.660 --> 09:11.420]  That was smoky a little bit after that.
[09:12.360 --> 09:12.840]  Oh!
[09:14.320 --> 09:15.480]  Get away from me!
[09:15.680 --> 09:17.100]  Man, you really can't turn in these cars.
[09:17.560 --> 09:17.900]  No!
[09:18.420 --> 09:20.680]  Do they deliberately make cars shitty and...
[09:20.680 --> 09:22.940]  so you go on bikes in this game type?
[09:23.560 --> 09:24.620]  No, this is what they always want.
[09:24.620 --> 09:26.120]  This is how it is to drive!
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.220]  No one can understand you when you talk about how much fun this is.
[09:30.340 --> 09:31.280]  Lone wolf biker!
[09:34.040 --> 09:34.520]  Survive!
[09:35.100 --> 09:35.400]  Yes!
[09:36.320 --> 09:37.160]  You kill each other?
[09:37.440 --> 09:38.420]  Oh no, Eric's the...
[09:39.040 --> 09:39.960]  Lone wolf!
[09:42.560 --> 09:43.580]  He's not a wolf.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.660]  He's a licensed music wolf right now, probably.
[09:47.560 --> 09:48.780]  Werewolves of London!
[09:51.760 --> 09:52.260]  Werewolves of London!
[09:52.260 --> 09:53.660]  I saw the driving!
[09:54.080 --> 09:55.120]  Oh no, if I die...
[09:55.120 --> 09:55.580]  Oh, Geoff!
[09:56.620 --> 09:57.020]  I'm on fire.
[09:57.060 --> 09:57.400]  Eric!
[09:57.860 --> 09:58.520]  Geoff, hop in!
[09:59.040 --> 09:59.680]  I think I'm dead.
[10:00.080 --> 10:00.500]  Geoff died.
[10:02.120 --> 10:02.960]  I think I'm dead.
[10:03.360 --> 10:04.000]  I was on fire.
[10:07.440 --> 10:10.320]  Yeah, getting stuck behind, you might as well just off yourself.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.780]  It's the easier said than done in this game.
[10:13.160 --> 10:13.400]  Yeah.
[10:16.000 --> 10:16.780]  Oh god.
[10:17.900 --> 10:18.940]  Well, that was awesome.
[10:21.900 --> 10:22.380]  Yeah!
[10:22.660 --> 10:23.200]  Oh no!
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.680]  Lone wolf walker!
[10:28.130 --> 10:28.610]  Oh!
[10:29.170 --> 10:31.690]  How many times do I have to shoot you before I get the credit?
[10:31.910 --> 10:33.110]  God, bless America!
[10:33.870 --> 10:36.390]  Hang on, is Andrew the lone wolf biker?
[10:36.650 --> 10:37.770]  Oh, bless America.
[10:37.770 --> 10:40.110]  You know, Nick's getting really mad when he starts blessing stuff.
[10:40.110 --> 10:42.730]  When he starts cursing non-cursing.
[10:42.930 --> 10:45.350]  Yeah, that's how you know I'm really mad.
[10:47.950 --> 10:49.150]  Andrew, please!
[10:49.430 --> 10:51.690]  Just accept your death!
[10:51.690 --> 10:52.730]  Andrew, please!
[10:54.390 --> 10:56.650]  I refuse to bless America!
[11:00.030 --> 11:01.250]  Oh, fuck!
[11:02.230 --> 11:04.190]  Oh, damn it!
[11:08.700 --> 11:09.540]  Yes!
[11:09.540 --> 11:11.220]  Nick finally got the lone wolf!
[11:12.040 --> 11:12.860]  Achievement!
[11:14.280 --> 11:15.440]  Was that really an achievement?
[11:16.100 --> 11:16.300]  Yeah!
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.660]  For killing him.
[11:20.960 --> 11:22.740]  Oh, I need to go to the checkpoint.
[11:22.880 --> 11:23.380]  You idiot!
[11:25.860 --> 11:27.240]  Do you have to cross the bridge to do that?
[11:27.360 --> 11:27.540]  Yeah.
[11:27.780 --> 11:28.140]  Hello, goodbye.
[11:30.340 --> 11:32.520]  Oh, I missed every shot!
[11:32.640 --> 11:33.120]  I suck!
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.320]  Geoff!
[11:34.840 --> 11:35.120]  Geoff!
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.120]  I'm the lone wolf!
[11:36.700 --> 11:38.200]  Geoff, do your classic howl!
[11:38.420 --> 11:38.880]  I was...
[11:38.880 --> 11:39.320]  Howl!
[11:40.020 --> 11:40.500]  Oh!
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.380]  Ah, Eric!
[11:42.380 --> 11:44.760]  Wo-wo-wo-wo-wolf!
[11:45.400 --> 11:47.520]  Eric, we're on the same team!
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.620]  There's no teams with the lone wolf.
[11:51.060 --> 11:53.980]  I've been lying in wait this whole time for the perfect moment to strike.
[11:54.980 --> 11:55.720]  Howl style!
[11:59.680 --> 12:00.900]  Ah! You're killing me!
[12:01.360 --> 12:01.980]  You killed me!
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.120]  This sucks so much.
[12:03.240 --> 12:04.080]  Oh, my God.
[12:04.800 --> 12:05.600]  This is so much fun.
[12:07.060 --> 12:08.700]  The driving is so bad.
[12:08.820 --> 12:09.200]  It's the worst!
[12:09.420 --> 12:10.580]  Get up, get up, get up, get up!
[12:10.580 --> 12:11.320]  Yeah, just kill me.
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.000]  Oh, my God!
[12:13.340 --> 12:14.180]  Cut me down!
[12:14.440 --> 12:14.860]  Take me!
[12:15.220 --> 12:18.080]  I saved you, Gavin!
[12:18.160 --> 12:18.720]  I saved you!
[12:19.520 --> 12:19.920]  Oh, my God.
[12:19.920 --> 12:20.960]  Wait, did I give you an advantage?
[12:21.400 --> 12:22.240]  Gavin, Eric, kill me!
[12:24.260 --> 12:25.080]  I gotta go.
[12:25.220 --> 12:25.500]  Eric!
[12:26.040 --> 12:26.720]  You fool.
[12:27.440 --> 12:28.280]  Eric, let me die!
[12:30.300 --> 12:30.700]  Eric!
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.360]  It's so hard to catch up.
[12:34.280 --> 12:35.580]  All around me...
[12:35.580 --> 12:36.060]  It can be.
[12:36.260 --> 12:37.520]  Eric, come back and shoot me in the head!
[12:38.600 --> 12:39.080]  Eric, please!
[12:39.380 --> 12:40.400]  I'm gone, buddy!
[12:40.860 --> 12:42.040]  I'm behind you.
[12:43.160 --> 12:43.340]  Ah!
[12:44.660 --> 12:47.780]  But then when they do catch up, boy, are they the lone wolves.
[12:49.280 --> 12:49.940]  Oh, no!
[12:50.020 --> 12:50.660]  He's close!
[12:50.720 --> 12:51.740]  He's close to the bridge!
[12:54.740 --> 12:56.240]  If I get to the bridge, that's safe.
[12:56.320 --> 12:56.900]  He can't shoot me.
[12:57.500 --> 12:58.080]  That's the base.
[12:58.380 --> 12:59.020]  Bridge is base.
[12:59.780 --> 13:00.520]  Wolf rules.
[13:04.340 --> 13:05.820]  Wolf sounded like a ghost.
[13:07.520 --> 13:08.440]  I'm just very dramatic.
[13:08.440 --> 13:08.840]  Ghost wolf!
[13:08.840 --> 13:11.420]  I'm a classically trained theater wolf.
[13:15.580 --> 13:17.600]  Thank God there's only one of them.
[13:19.340 --> 13:20.040]  Oh, no!
[13:20.220 --> 13:20.540]  Ah!
[13:20.720 --> 13:21.360]  Oh, God.
[13:21.460 --> 13:22.760]  Can you calm down, Gavin?
[13:23.120 --> 13:23.500]  You what?
[13:24.360 --> 13:25.640]  Can you calm down?
[13:25.980 --> 13:27.860]  I was trying to spawn you closer.
[13:28.620 --> 13:29.260]  Oh, great.
[13:31.900 --> 13:32.780]  Where are we going?
[13:33.700 --> 13:34.020]  I don't know.
[13:34.140 --> 13:34.680]  Oh, no!
[13:35.000 --> 13:35.800]  Let's kill ourselves.
[13:37.220 --> 13:37.960]  Hot dog stand.
[13:40.240 --> 13:41.320]  I know where he is now.
[13:41.400 --> 13:42.160]  I know the hot dog stand.
[13:42.260 --> 13:43.280]  I'm familiar with the hot dog stand.
[13:44.200 --> 13:46.220]  I don't like that somebody's up my butt.
[13:46.940 --> 13:47.420]  What's up?
[13:48.160 --> 13:48.580]  No!
[13:48.940 --> 13:49.660]  Stupid pole!
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.400]  That helped me do a 360 fucking spin.
[13:52.500 --> 13:53.060]  That was awesome.
[13:53.180 --> 13:53.820]  Did that on purpose.
[13:54.220 --> 13:55.540]  Fucking tutorial right there.
[13:56.840 --> 13:57.940]  That's how you can escape.
[13:58.640 --> 13:59.100]  Gavin!
[13:59.440 --> 14:00.680]  Get out the fucking way!
[14:02.300 --> 14:02.760]  Serpentine.
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.300]  Serpentine.
[14:03.500 --> 14:03.900]  Serpentine.
[14:04.060 --> 14:04.480]  Serpentine.
[14:04.680 --> 14:05.100]  Duck and weave.
[14:05.340 --> 14:07.080]  Oh, shit.
[14:08.840 --> 14:09.420]  There he goes!
[14:12.180 --> 14:14.120]  Damn it, he did a hard turn.
[14:14.180 --> 14:14.580]  Get away.
[14:16.580 --> 14:21.620]  I'm going to use my sneaky tactical maneuvers of slowing down and going the other direction.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.120]  They shall never catch me.
[14:28.040 --> 14:28.520]  Gavin!
[14:29.240 --> 14:29.840]  What happened?
[14:29.940 --> 14:30.340]  What'd I do?
[14:30.760 --> 14:33.960]  When you hit that pole, it made an obstacle.
[14:34.760 --> 14:37.340]  He knocked mixed words out of his mouth, apparently.
[14:37.340 --> 14:39.540]  He knocked my brain from my body.
[14:40.140 --> 14:41.000]  Word obstacle.
[14:43.260 --> 14:43.700]  No!
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.440]  You wanted me to do that, you son of a bitch.
[14:47.500 --> 14:48.200]  Nice, Gavin.
[14:49.200 --> 14:49.340]  Ow!
[14:50.040 --> 14:50.420]  Oh, shit.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.800]  Come here, bastard.
[14:53.500 --> 14:53.960]  Come here.
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.820]  Come here, you...
[14:57.820 --> 14:58.320]  Come here!
[14:59.540 --> 14:59.980]  Yes!
[15:00.200 --> 15:00.360]  No!
[15:04.320 --> 15:04.760]  Shit.
[15:05.600 --> 15:06.540]  Oh, are you on a bridge?
[15:06.540 --> 15:07.260]  Oh!
[15:08.300 --> 15:09.240]  Bridging it!
[15:10.500 --> 15:11.640]  Dodge it! Bridge it!
[15:12.460 --> 15:12.920]  Die, dummy.
[15:14.400 --> 15:15.880]  There we go.
[15:17.240 --> 15:19.020]  Now I'm the lone wolf.
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.360]  Just the lone wolf.
[15:20.380 --> 15:23.300]  It spawned me under the bridge, you shit motorcycle!
[15:25.420 --> 15:26.500]  I'm doing the wheelies.
[15:26.900 --> 15:27.660]  Success wheelies.
[15:27.960 --> 15:29.660]  Victory wheelie!
[15:30.540 --> 15:32.600]  What's the wind condition on this fucking game?
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.480]  Let me through!
[15:34.800 --> 15:35.780]  I think you've got to get to the finish.
[15:35.780 --> 15:36.660]  Oh my god.
[15:36.960 --> 15:37.240]  Ah!
[15:37.820 --> 15:38.100]  Nick died.
[15:39.400 --> 15:40.520]  I caught fire!
[15:42.960 --> 15:44.060]  Trying to catch up to him.
[15:48.980 --> 15:49.840]  Gavin died.
[15:50.560 --> 15:50.900]  Blew up.
[15:54.540 --> 15:56.160]  You gonna try to shoot me like that?
[15:56.460 --> 15:57.560]  Nonsense. Ridiculous.
[15:57.960 --> 16:00.200]  You don't even understand the moves that I'm doing here.
[16:00.680 --> 16:01.240]  Oh!
[16:02.820 --> 16:03.840]  Where did I go?
[16:04.920 --> 16:05.480]  Zing!
[16:06.760 --> 16:09.620]  That was all part of a fucking tutorial there too.
[16:09.760 --> 16:11.160]  Gavin, go ahead and re-cam that.
[16:13.460 --> 16:14.840]  Does that exist in this version?
[16:15.360 --> 16:15.960]  I don't know.
[16:16.300 --> 16:16.820]  It does on PC.
[16:17.960 --> 16:19.240]  Wow, we should have played it, Gavin.
[16:19.500 --> 16:22.280]  I know the reason why I'm confused you didn't want to play the PC version.
[16:23.220 --> 16:23.860]  Very weird.
[16:25.300 --> 16:25.660]  Dambule.
[16:26.160 --> 16:26.680]  Pass the checkpoint.
[16:26.760 --> 16:27.040]  Oh!
[16:27.320 --> 16:27.660]  Wow!
[16:27.780 --> 16:29.060]  Oh shit, Geoff got a point.
[16:29.840 --> 16:30.200]  Geoff!
[16:31.100 --> 16:33.500]  How many times do I have to miss you before you die?
[16:34.740 --> 16:35.700]  I'm afraid you...
[16:35.700 --> 16:36.520]  Gotcha!
[16:36.780 --> 16:37.560]  Exactly that many times.
[16:38.360 --> 16:38.760]  Okay.
[16:39.480 --> 16:40.200]  Took a while.
[16:45.020 --> 16:45.740]  Where's the thing?
[16:53.960 --> 16:55.320]  I'm too fast for you.
[16:55.580 --> 16:55.820]  Goodbye.
[16:56.840 --> 16:57.880]  Oh shit, I killed myself.
[16:59.240 --> 17:01.700]  How did you survive that?
[17:01.820 --> 17:03.480]  It's not good. It's not good.
[17:03.760 --> 17:04.200]  It's not...
[17:05.340 --> 17:06.200]  Who is it? Is it me?
[17:06.520 --> 17:06.860]  Is it you?
[17:07.340 --> 17:08.340]  It's you!
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.280]  Where'd you guys go?
[17:12.000 --> 17:13.420]  We fell into a tunnel.
[17:13.900 --> 17:15.300]  Oh no! He went underground!
[17:15.660 --> 17:16.260]  Kill him!
[17:19.080 --> 17:19.580]  Wait!
[17:21.200 --> 17:22.180]  Get me out of here!
[17:22.360 --> 17:23.120]  Get me out of here!
[17:23.560 --> 17:24.300]  Get me out of here!
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.160]  Lone wolf foot biker!
[17:27.740 --> 17:28.960]  Lone wolf foot biker!
[17:31.020 --> 17:32.420]  How? How?
[17:32.880 --> 17:33.380]  How?
[17:35.420 --> 17:35.980]  Evade!
[17:37.060 --> 17:37.620]  Evade!
[17:40.120 --> 17:41.020]  He's gone.
[17:41.240 --> 17:42.140]  Can I get on?
[17:42.860 --> 17:43.640]  He's in the wind!
[17:44.280 --> 17:45.420]  Okay, he's gone.
[17:48.040 --> 17:48.600]  Andrew!
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.480]  Why do you keep moving?
[17:51.060 --> 17:52.340]  Because I'm scared you're going to knock me off.
[17:52.340 --> 17:53.620]  Get on!
[17:54.080 --> 17:54.800]  I can't get on.
[17:55.020 --> 17:56.420]  Oh my god!
[18:02.520 --> 18:03.260]  Hit him!
[18:05.900 --> 18:07.740]  Fucking Gavin running down the street.
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.660]  He's a fat little fucker.
[18:14.720 --> 18:17.200]  Where the hell is the thing? Is it across the bridge?
[18:25.100 --> 18:26.040]  Where am I supposed to go?
[18:26.060 --> 18:26.740]  You're on the wrong way, Gavin.
[18:27.640 --> 18:28.360]  Where's the thing?
[18:29.640 --> 18:30.880]  Where'd all the cars go?
[18:31.100 --> 18:31.680]  Oh, there we go.
[18:31.920 --> 18:34.040]  Oh, the bridge! It's so far!
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.440]  Where am I supposed to go?
[18:42.540 --> 18:43.560]  Where am I supposed to go?
[18:45.360 --> 18:46.160]  To hell!
[18:46.160 --> 18:46.880]  No!
[18:54.110 --> 18:55.230]  What am I doing?
[18:55.230 --> 18:56.350]  Overlapping wheels of fire!
[18:57.430 --> 18:59.150]  Oh, whoops.
[19:00.370 --> 19:01.510]  Always good to hear.
[19:04.210 --> 19:05.470]  How do I NOS?
[19:06.850 --> 19:07.950]  Great question.
[19:08.350 --> 19:09.170]  I think it's A.
[19:10.430 --> 19:11.590]  I just honked my horn.
[19:12.010 --> 19:12.290]  Why?
[19:13.830 --> 19:14.670]  No, Andrew!
[19:15.530 --> 19:17.490]  He's under the damn thing, stairs!
[19:18.130 --> 19:18.390]  Bridge!
[19:18.390 --> 19:19.510]  How do I...
[19:20.330 --> 19:21.790]  How do I get down there?
[19:21.970 --> 19:22.350]  Up there.
[19:22.650 --> 19:23.390]  I learned it from Tron!
[19:27.650 --> 19:31.150]  Lone biker, lone wolf biker, riding down the street.
[19:31.470 --> 19:32.530]  Not getting shot at.
[19:32.530 --> 19:33.870]  Just to go down the fucking...
[19:33.870 --> 19:34.590]  Are you an idiot, Geoff?
[19:34.630 --> 19:35.270]  Oh, that's great.
[19:36.890 --> 19:38.310]  Went up the stairs just to go down.
[19:42.150 --> 19:42.550]  Shortcut!
[19:43.090 --> 19:43.930]  Do I need a point?
[19:44.010 --> 19:45.150]  There's only 34 seconds left.
[19:45.170 --> 19:46.770]  Squad! Hey, why are you shooting me, dipshit?
[19:47.490 --> 19:48.130]  What?
[19:50.430 --> 19:51.070]  Well...
[19:51.070 --> 19:52.170]  Not with a lone wolf!
[19:54.450 --> 19:54.690]  Whoops!
[19:55.790 --> 19:56.870]  Fuck! Fuck!
[19:57.930 --> 19:58.330]  Fuck!
[20:02.410 --> 20:05.810]  What? What?
[20:06.810 --> 20:07.930]  What? What you talking about?
[20:16.770 --> 20:17.350]  Thanks, Nick.
[20:17.790 --> 20:19.130]  Geoff, you can't drive 55.
[20:20.870 --> 20:21.250]  Winner!
[20:22.610 --> 20:24.490]  All right, I wonder which game type I was thinking of.
[20:24.730 --> 20:27.030]  Yeah, I don't know, because it couldn't have been that, right?
[20:27.930 --> 20:30.030]  All right, let's do...
[20:30.550 --> 20:32.030]  We can't do chopper versus chopper.
[20:32.150 --> 20:33.470]  Let's do witness protection.
[20:33.810 --> 20:34.750]  Andrew, what's our team name?
[20:36.470 --> 20:37.510]  Noose, I believe.
[20:38.370 --> 20:39.610]  All right, guys, we're going to call...
[20:39.610 --> 20:41.470]  Let's say we're the lost.
[20:41.670 --> 20:42.670]  Yeah, we'll be the lost.
[20:43.230 --> 20:44.090]  Okay, I like it.
[20:44.370 --> 20:44.650]  Cool.
[20:45.190 --> 20:46.210]  What's going on?
[20:46.210 --> 20:46.970]  What are we doing?
[20:47.270 --> 20:48.010]  We're killing them.
[20:48.310 --> 20:50.190]  Destroy the prison bus and kill the witness.
[20:50.310 --> 20:51.310]  Oh, shit, I'm in a prison bus.
[20:51.490 --> 20:51.770]  Let's do it.
[20:51.810 --> 20:52.490]  I got you, Gavin.
[20:52.630 --> 20:54.030]  I'm a vehicle behind you.
[20:54.030 --> 20:54.510]  Let's do it, boys.
[20:54.830 --> 20:56.110]  What's with the color scheme?
[20:57.490 --> 20:58.350]  This is the game.
[20:58.430 --> 20:58.710]  I don't know.
[20:58.770 --> 20:59.370]  You love this game.
[20:59.410 --> 21:01.550]  Yeah, you talk about this game all the time.
[21:01.650 --> 21:02.290]  I don't...
[21:02.290 --> 21:04.050]  Like, this is the game you wanted to play.
[21:04.310 --> 21:06.210]  We could be playing regular GTA online.
[21:07.590 --> 21:07.990]  Oh, yeah.
[21:08.110 --> 21:09.330]  We could do that after this.
[21:09.790 --> 21:10.150]  Okay.
[21:11.070 --> 21:12.870]  We're talking about snipers versus stunners.
[21:13.990 --> 21:14.610]  Oh, yeah.
[21:14.630 --> 21:17.010]  We have to find the snipers versus stunners to play.
[21:17.310 --> 21:18.170]  That'd be a lot of fun.
[21:18.490 --> 21:19.250]  We could do that.
[21:19.290 --> 21:19.730]  That'd be great.
[21:19.750 --> 21:19.970]  Yeah, let's do that.
[21:21.010 --> 21:22.710]  But for now, I'm in a prison bus.
[21:23.250 --> 21:24.850]  But for now, you're dead as dicks.
[21:25.250 --> 21:25.510]  Nah.
[21:26.050 --> 21:26.550]  Andrew, help!
[21:26.830 --> 21:27.230]  Whoa!
[21:27.550 --> 21:29.030]  Oh, I missed all of them.
[21:29.050 --> 21:29.290]  Yeah.
[21:29.430 --> 21:30.970]  Okay, I'm circling around.
[21:31.630 --> 21:32.470]  I'll be there in a second, Gavin.
[21:32.470 --> 21:33.190]  I'm circling around.
[21:34.530 --> 21:35.230]  Andrew, help!
[21:35.890 --> 21:36.390]  I'm on my way.
[21:36.450 --> 21:37.150]  I'm circling around.
[21:40.070 --> 21:40.850]  Oh, Gavin!
[21:41.110 --> 21:41.850]  Way to go, idiot.
[21:44.950 --> 21:45.470]  Die!
[21:45.670 --> 21:46.070]  Oh, my God.
[21:46.470 --> 21:47.130]  Oh, shit.
[21:48.630 --> 21:49.770]  I'm circling around.
[21:50.110 --> 21:50.910]  Oh, I went down.
[21:51.290 --> 21:51.990]  I've made a mistake.
[21:52.610 --> 21:53.590]  Geoff killed me.
[21:54.190 --> 21:55.170]  Well, listen.
[21:55.510 --> 21:56.470]  Yeah, go ahead.
[21:57.590 --> 21:58.170]  Listen to this.
[21:58.850 --> 21:59.370]  Gavin!
[21:59.790 --> 22:00.970]  No, Gavin!
[22:01.410 --> 22:02.110]  You fool!
[22:02.790 --> 22:03.690]  Are you driving in the water?
[22:04.070 --> 22:04.490]  Yeah!
[22:06.190 --> 22:07.570]  He's not going to be a problem.
[22:07.970 --> 22:08.670]  Oh, shit!
[22:08.990 --> 22:09.510]  No!
[22:10.210 --> 22:12.550]  I think we lost the game for some reason.
[22:12.550 --> 22:13.110]  Yeah!
[22:13.690 --> 22:14.090]  Yay!
[22:14.610 --> 22:15.570]  Go, The Lost!
[22:16.470 --> 22:17.370]  All right, now I'm the cost.
[22:17.390 --> 22:17.610]  Wait, what?
[22:19.270 --> 22:20.350]  Well, the bus is gone.
[22:21.730 --> 22:22.570]  Didn't we win?
[22:22.670 --> 22:23.830]  Lost win again, baby.
[22:24.710 --> 22:25.590]  Two left!
[22:25.810 --> 22:26.130]  Yeah!
[22:26.850 --> 22:28.010]  The Lost win!
[22:28.570 --> 22:30.570]  That took them a long time to drown.
[22:30.670 --> 22:32.830]  Do you think that was the game type you were thinking of?
[22:39.580 --> 22:41.520]  Oh, you can change traffic to high.
[22:41.960 --> 22:42.500]  Let's do that.
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.060]  Do it!
[22:43.120 --> 22:43.540]  Sounds good.
[22:44.060 --> 22:44.240]  Yep.
[22:46.700 --> 22:47.140]  Uh...
[22:47.140 --> 22:47.560]  Oh, hold on.
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.120]  We can change pedestrians to high.
[22:49.240 --> 22:49.600]  Let's do that.
[22:51.000 --> 22:51.360]  Uh...
[22:51.360 --> 22:52.520]  Do the same thing, Nick.
[22:52.880 --> 22:54.220]  Yeah, Nick, come over to Team 2.
[22:55.120 --> 22:55.920]  Oh, I changed it.
[22:55.920 --> 23:01.500]  You go down until it says Team, and you're on Team 1, and you hit left or right, and you go to Team 2.
[23:01.640 --> 23:02.160]  Okay, so you hit A.
[23:02.160 --> 23:02.800]  You're just readied up.
[23:03.340 --> 23:03.700]  That's...
[23:03.700 --> 23:05.700]  All right, for real this time.
[23:06.000 --> 23:06.640]  Andrew, let's do...
[23:06.640 --> 23:07.720]  Geoff, what the hell?
[23:11.160 --> 23:12.340]  This is a mess.
[23:13.200 --> 23:13.700]  Oh, Andrew.
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.440]  I changed the settings a little bit.
[23:15.800 --> 23:16.200]  All right.
[23:16.200 --> 23:18.920]  I set the spawn timers down to one second, and I set it to close.
[23:19.440 --> 23:20.340]  Oh, hell yeah.
[23:20.920 --> 23:22.100]  We'll have instant action.
[23:23.580 --> 23:25.160]  Andrew, just don't put it in the river.
[23:25.940 --> 23:26.520]  Nah, I'm good.
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.740]  We're staying on land.
[23:29.080 --> 23:29.560]  China Road!
[23:31.140 --> 23:32.820]  I hate driving in this fucking game.
[23:35.180 --> 23:35.920]  What are you doing?
[23:37.260 --> 23:38.540]  I'm going the way I'm supposed to go.
[23:40.540 --> 23:41.640]  I like the sound of that.
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.400]  They're already arguing.
[23:43.000 --> 23:43.200]  Yep.
[23:43.360 --> 23:44.100]  Here we go!
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.380]  This is good for the lost, baby.
[23:45.380 --> 23:46.760]  That's the way we do it at the lost.
[23:48.120 --> 23:49.100]  We might be lost.
[23:49.480 --> 23:52.600]  At lost HQ, where we all hang out all day long, waiting for witnesses to kill.
[23:53.340 --> 23:54.380]  Oh, my God!
[23:55.000 --> 23:55.620]  Oh, careful.
[23:56.080 --> 23:57.220]  That car came out of nowhere, baby.
[23:57.240 --> 23:58.700]  You might be lost, but you're about to be damned.
[23:59.940 --> 24:01.280]  See, they don't know what to do, Gavin.
[24:02.260 --> 24:02.940]  Oh, no!
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.880]  Gavin, you flipped me!
[24:05.580 --> 24:06.600]  Gavin, you flipped me!
[24:06.700 --> 24:07.680]  I think we know what to do now.
[24:07.740 --> 24:07.880]  Yep.
[24:08.700 --> 24:09.000]  Kill him!
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.020]  Gavin, you flipped me!
[24:10.020 --> 24:11.440]  It's okay, Gavin's focused on me.
[24:11.500 --> 24:11.840]  We're good.
[24:12.680 --> 24:13.520]  How do we change weapons?
[24:13.520 --> 24:15.460]  Gavin's not allowed to be on this team anymore.
[24:15.760 --> 24:17.740]  You can't get over?
[24:18.520 --> 24:18.920]  No!
[24:20.960 --> 24:22.720]  Why don't you try driving forwards?
[24:24.080 --> 24:24.880]  I'm trying!
[24:25.780 --> 24:26.280]  There you are.
[24:26.340 --> 24:27.840]  You were driving in the reverse the whole way.
[24:27.880 --> 24:28.920]  I was going back!
[24:30.160 --> 24:30.740]  Alright, hold on.
[24:30.780 --> 24:31.320]  I killed Gavin.
[24:31.440 --> 24:31.960]  Let me get back to killing him.
[24:31.980 --> 24:32.600]  I'm almost up.
[24:32.980 --> 24:35.580]  Oh, my God.
[24:35.740 --> 24:35.920]  What?
[24:36.300 --> 24:36.700]  Gavin!
[24:36.900 --> 24:37.320]  My bad, Nick.
[24:38.100 --> 24:39.020]  Spawned me indoors.
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.580]  Jesus Christ.
[24:43.520 --> 24:43.800]  Gavin!
[24:44.100 --> 24:45.140]  Okay, I'm up.
[24:46.920 --> 24:49.680]  Gavin, you flipped me immediately!
[24:50.220 --> 24:51.540]  What do you mean, no Gavin, you?
[24:51.760 --> 24:52.800]  You drove backwards.
[24:53.060 --> 24:54.400]  You kind of answered the blame.
[24:54.560 --> 24:56.660]  Was the problem I drove backwards?
[24:57.020 --> 24:57.200]  Yeah.
[24:57.420 --> 24:57.780]  No!
[24:58.080 --> 25:00.580]  The problem was I was on my side.
[25:00.880 --> 25:01.620]  Did you end up flipped?
[25:02.700 --> 25:04.080]  What are you talking about?
[25:04.620 --> 25:05.420]  You ended up flipped.
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.000]  If you get stabbed in a different state, you're not at fault for buying a plane ticket to get there.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.260]  What do you mean?
[25:14.580 --> 25:16.540]  Yeah, but if you run backwards into the night...
[25:18.640 --> 25:20.040]  That's kind of what I was thinking.
[25:20.440 --> 25:20.660]  Yeah.
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.080]  This is fun to shoot.
[25:22.920 --> 25:23.640]  Yeah, I like it.
[25:24.680 --> 25:25.140]  That's me.
[25:25.560 --> 25:27.180]  It's fun to have no health on this bus.
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.620]  And this isn't an indictment on anybody in particular in this, but I remember these games being a little more competitive at Achievement Hunt.
[25:33.580 --> 25:34.000]  Oh, yeah?
[25:37.220 --> 25:37.780]  Thank you, Nick.
[25:38.840 --> 25:40.520]  Do you remember, Geoff?
[25:40.520 --> 25:46.780]  Do you remember playing this and having one of them drive the bus into the river immediately and then playing again?
[25:46.980 --> 25:50.720]  And then having them flip the bus on its side immediately?
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.040]  I wasn't trying to play in the river. You were trying to drive the whole way in reverse.
[25:54.640 --> 25:56.660]  Yeah, but that wasn't why we died.
[25:57.040 --> 25:59.100]  We died because I got flipped over.
[26:00.040 --> 26:01.480]  We gotta do it one more time.
[26:01.620 --> 26:02.560]  We gotta do it one more time.
[26:02.640 --> 26:03.580]  Let's do it properly.
[26:04.480 --> 26:05.780]  I agree, Gavin.
[26:06.960 --> 26:09.540]  I think there's blame on both sides.
[26:10.520 --> 26:10.840]  I...
[26:12.240 --> 26:13.760]  Nick, there you go.
[26:13.880 --> 26:14.360]  I moved!
[26:14.880 --> 26:15.700]  Oh, this is great.
[26:16.440 --> 26:17.560]  Yeah, I'm having a great time.
[26:18.220 --> 26:19.120]  Alright, Andrew, it's all you.
[26:20.060 --> 26:20.800]  It's all you.
[26:21.020 --> 26:23.360]  What do you mean it's all me? It's literally been all you every time.
[26:25.700 --> 26:26.860]  Hey, it's a sunny day today.
[26:27.640 --> 26:28.160]  It's beautiful.
[26:28.360 --> 26:29.700]  It's their version of a sunny day today.
[26:30.760 --> 26:33.060]  Nick, what are you doing, man? You trying to go into the house?
[26:33.060 --> 26:34.420]  That was a pretty cool power slide, man.
[26:34.560 --> 26:37.340]  Nick drove up the steps and knocked on the front door with his motorcycle.
[26:38.280 --> 26:38.460]  Yep.
[26:38.460 --> 26:39.300]  Hello?
[26:40.040 --> 26:42.000]  Did you ever get the right way up again, Andrew?
[26:43.480 --> 26:46.120]  At the very end when I had like 5% health.
[26:48.820 --> 26:49.700]  Oh, shit.
[26:49.860 --> 26:50.780]  A little mis-timing.
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.640]  Oh, it changed it.
[26:57.620 --> 26:59.500]  The auto directions keep adjusting.
[27:00.360 --> 27:01.540]  Oh, we got this this time.
[27:04.800 --> 27:05.520]  Get ready, Eric.
[27:08.820 --> 27:09.940]  Die, you bastards.
[27:11.380 --> 27:12.460]  You got him, you got him.
[27:13.480 --> 27:13.920]  Nice.
[27:14.180 --> 27:14.460]  Gavin's dead.
[27:16.180 --> 27:17.620]  Oh, he's spawning that.
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.060]  Yeah, die.
[27:20.120 --> 27:20.560]  Nice.
[27:21.440 --> 27:22.480]  Good job, Gavin.
[27:22.780 --> 27:24.080]  I'm killing them a little bit.
[27:24.160 --> 27:26.540]  Yeah, way to spawn right there, Gavin. Great job.
[27:26.900 --> 27:28.340]  Yeah, you just spawned right there too, though.
[27:29.620 --> 27:32.480]  Yeah, I set the spawns to super close.
[27:33.500 --> 27:34.620]  I took Gavin's old car.
[27:35.840 --> 27:37.100]  Eric's in a police car.
[27:37.700 --> 27:41.500]  No, no, hey, I mean, Gavin has the sirens on.
[27:41.620 --> 27:42.560]  It means pull over.
[27:43.300 --> 27:43.840]  It's me.
[27:44.300 --> 27:44.800]  It's not.
[27:45.140 --> 27:45.740]  It's a noose.
[27:46.480 --> 27:47.380]  It's one of the noose.
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.200]  Andrew, I've made it.
[27:51.840 --> 27:52.320]  Oh, my God.
[27:52.420 --> 27:54.420]  It spawns you under the bridge?
[27:54.560 --> 27:55.420]  Oh, my God.
[27:55.760 --> 27:56.560]  Hell, yeah.
[27:56.760 --> 27:57.220]  Oh, no.
[27:57.260 --> 27:58.080]  I lost my tire.
[27:59.600 --> 28:01.640]  They're coming up from the back, Gavin.
[28:03.480 --> 28:04.720]  They're coming the other way.
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.720]  Sorry, I'm going to need that scooter.
[28:18.130 --> 28:18.770]  The bridge!
[28:19.050 --> 28:19.250]  No!
[28:20.390 --> 28:21.970]  We've still got tons of health, Gavin. We're doing great.
[28:22.050 --> 28:24.750]  Yeah, you guys are killing all this one. Third time's a charm.
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.210]  You guys are doing much better this time.
[28:27.670 --> 28:30.690]  I'm taking right. I don't know how close we are to delivering any of these.
[28:32.690 --> 28:34.030]  Oh, it looks like it's on our mini-map.
[28:34.950 --> 28:35.490]  These people.
[28:35.950 --> 28:39.150]  I've never referred to a bus full of people as these.
[28:41.730 --> 28:42.430]  Oh, no!
[28:43.190 --> 28:43.590]  Fuck!
[28:44.590 --> 28:45.230]  Oh, God.
[28:45.590 --> 28:46.770]  Oh, the humanity.
[28:47.690 --> 28:49.070]  Oh, I flew far.
[28:49.610 --> 28:50.610]  He thinks he's people.
[28:51.530 --> 28:52.190]  Flew far.
[28:54.670 --> 28:55.710]  I need your car.
[28:57.330 --> 28:58.450]  Let's take a little shortcut here.
[28:58.470 --> 29:00.710]  Yeah, you're doing good, too. We're all secure. This is awesome.
[29:01.470 --> 29:02.790]  I'm a bit smoky, but...
[29:03.370 --> 29:04.410]  Man, that sucked.
[29:05.490 --> 29:06.170]  You lost your bike.
[29:06.610 --> 29:09.650]  Yeah, I fucking... I flew about a half a mile.
[29:09.990 --> 29:10.410]  Right when I was...
[29:11.630 --> 29:13.310]  Yeah, like, kind of like that. Kind of like that.
[29:15.090 --> 29:15.410]  God.
[29:17.410 --> 29:17.870]  Oh, hey.
[29:17.990 --> 29:20.370]  Really sets you back. I was right up their ass, too, for a second there.
[29:20.530 --> 29:23.510]  Yeah. Felt like I was gaining good ground. That's gone.
[29:24.770 --> 29:25.110]  Where's Eric?
[29:25.610 --> 29:26.230]  I'm coming.
[29:27.190 --> 29:28.450]  They're starting to drop people off.
[29:29.070 --> 29:30.390]  We need these witnesses to die.
[29:30.470 --> 29:31.770]  They're gonna turn state's evidence.
[29:32.250 --> 29:36.010]  They're gonna find out all about our illegal baseball card raid.
[29:36.150 --> 29:39.430]  Do they think that we couldn't just kill them once they got there?
[29:40.190 --> 29:40.850]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[29:40.850 --> 29:42.550]  That's a good point. We'll get to them eventually.
[29:43.370 --> 29:43.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[29:46.230 --> 29:46.950]  Two left.
[29:50.570 --> 29:52.210]  Oh, they're at the police station. Never mind.
[29:52.970 --> 29:53.850]  All right, put some bullets in it.
[29:54.130 --> 29:54.910]  Oh, my God.
[29:55.870 --> 29:56.590]  Another bridge?
[29:58.230 --> 30:00.730]  I died on that bridge, and it has sent me back.
[30:02.010 --> 30:02.930]  Nice, Gavin.
[30:03.050 --> 30:06.410]  The editor will not use any of my footage for this entire part.
[30:07.090 --> 30:08.130]  Where have you been playing?
[30:08.470 --> 30:13.970]  Dude, I died on the bridge. I spawned under the bridge. I've been so behind the whole time.
[30:14.290 --> 30:15.030]  That's a motherfucker.
[30:15.610 --> 30:16.330]  It's bad.
[30:16.510 --> 30:17.610]  Crossing another bridge.
[30:18.030 --> 30:18.570]  Nice.
[30:19.130 --> 30:20.690]  Oh, I can see you.
[30:22.650 --> 30:25.750]  Well, the handbrake turn failed me.
[30:29.390 --> 30:31.790]  I'd be interested in seeing how they do with the bus.
[30:33.010 --> 30:33.810]  Oh, shit.
[30:36.850 --> 30:39.970]  Oh, this directed me the worst possible way.
[30:43.840 --> 30:44.920]  Oh, we did some tricks?
[30:46.440 --> 30:47.560]  Up the bridge.
[30:49.660 --> 30:50.960]  Geoff, is that you or is that Eric?
[30:51.020 --> 30:51.380]  It's me.
[30:53.280 --> 30:54.080]  Oh, you're in a car?
[30:54.280 --> 30:55.580]  Yeah, we're so not close.
[30:56.080 --> 30:57.680]  For the record, Nick, I am me though.
[30:59.520 --> 31:00.160]  I'm me?
[31:01.420 --> 31:03.640]  Okay, Geoff, I was with you. Don't worry about it.
[31:03.740 --> 31:04.040]  Thanks.
[31:04.240 --> 31:07.160]  No, it's a reference. Also, don't take the middle road. It's the wrong one.
[31:07.260 --> 31:07.820]  Yeah, no, I saw.
[31:08.540 --> 31:09.680]  Is it let me in the bus, do you think?
[31:10.420 --> 31:12.080]  No, we can try. Here, I'll pull over.
[31:13.320 --> 31:15.320]  You guys aren't even close to us, so you've got plenty of time.
[31:15.600 --> 31:16.780]  Go ahead. Hop in.
[31:17.680 --> 31:18.660]  Do whatever you want.
[31:20.020 --> 31:20.540]  Won't let you in?
[31:23.800 --> 31:24.620]  Try hopping on.
[31:24.880 --> 31:26.320]  Why don't you throw a sticky bomb on there?
[31:26.960 --> 31:28.360]  Oh, there are no sticky bombs.
[31:28.640 --> 31:29.780]  What happened?
[31:32.860 --> 31:35.100]  I started driving and he did like a full roll.
[31:37.200 --> 31:41.000]  Okay. Oh, whoops. Oh, shit. I just ran over a guy. I'm so sorry.
[31:41.220 --> 31:41.800]  Oh, shit. There's Eric.
[31:42.560 --> 31:43.280]  My door.
[31:43.840 --> 31:44.960]  Oh, fuck. They're here.
[31:45.980 --> 31:47.160]  Get him, Eric. Slow him down.
[31:49.060 --> 31:50.120]  We're at the second point.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.420]  I'm upside down.
[31:55.500 --> 31:55.860]  Ah.
[31:57.240 --> 31:57.780]  Alright, we'll leave Gavin.
[31:59.080 --> 31:59.300]  Yes!
[32:00.320 --> 32:01.200]  Did it blow him up?
[32:01.840 --> 32:02.940]  Oh, come on.
[32:03.320 --> 32:05.660]  I'm on my side again. I need help, Gavin.
[32:05.940 --> 32:06.580]  I'm coming. I'm coming.
[32:06.620 --> 32:07.740]  Gavin, I need help.
[32:07.900 --> 32:08.220]  Hold on.
[32:09.480 --> 32:11.500]  Anybody got any other explosives? I'm scared to look.
[32:11.660 --> 32:12.600]  I don't know how to do it.
[32:13.240 --> 32:14.160]  I don't know how to do it.
[32:14.180 --> 32:15.740]  Oh, I'm trying to get on my side.
[32:16.020 --> 32:17.420]  I'm a swamp guy on a moped.
[32:18.600 --> 32:20.040]  It's so slow as shit.
[32:20.160 --> 32:20.940]  Okay, I got back up.
[32:22.320 --> 32:24.220]  This is not good. I'm getting triple shotted.
[32:24.220 --> 32:24.880]  Andrew got me.
[32:28.940 --> 32:29.880]  Did I get Gavin?
[32:30.420 --> 32:30.720]  Yeah.
[32:30.840 --> 32:31.380]  I got Gavin.
[32:32.040 --> 32:32.560]  Or you got him.
[32:33.200 --> 32:35.180]  Oh, the prisoner's coming out. I'm shooting him.
[32:36.180 --> 32:37.640]  Shoot the prisoner. No mercy.
[32:38.060 --> 32:39.240]  Oh, fucking him up.
[32:39.360 --> 32:42.160]  Oh, dude. I killed the shit out of him. It was worth it, too.
[32:42.400 --> 32:42.500]  Yeah!
[32:42.800 --> 32:45.540]  He's gonna have to open his dumbass prisoner mouth again.
[32:46.780 --> 32:48.260]  I'm gonna blow. I'm gonna blow.
[32:48.260 --> 32:48.840]  I'm gonna go.
[32:49.080 --> 32:49.620]  Gavin's coming.
[32:49.620 --> 32:50.780]  Gavin, we're almost dead.
[32:51.940 --> 32:53.360]  Go, Andrew. Go, Andrew, son.
[32:53.640 --> 32:53.960]  Keep moving.
[32:54.500 --> 32:55.500]  Oh, my God!
[32:55.880 --> 32:55.940]  The bus is fucked.
[32:56.440 --> 32:57.280]  Always keep moving.
[32:57.660 --> 32:58.800]  The bus is fucked.
[32:59.220 --> 33:01.460]  That car blew up as I drove over it.
[33:01.620 --> 33:02.000]  Oh, he got me.
[33:02.540 --> 33:03.060]  Oh, shit.
[33:03.940 --> 33:05.060]  Andrew, I'm taking bullets for you.
[33:05.180 --> 33:06.240]  He's so close, guys. He's so close, guys.
[33:06.360 --> 33:06.540]  Yep.
[33:07.700 --> 33:08.040]  Oh!
[33:08.120 --> 33:08.820]  Gavin got me.
[33:11.320 --> 33:12.460]  Go, go, go!
[33:13.720 --> 33:14.160]  Ah!
[33:15.020 --> 33:15.500]  Yeah!
[33:16.260 --> 33:17.460]  Oh, my God.
[33:17.740 --> 33:17.980]  Yeah!
[33:20.240 --> 33:22.360]  I tried to slow him down. Did it work?
[33:23.880 --> 33:25.820]  We got the tiniest bit of health.
[33:26.120 --> 33:27.740]  Gavin, you need to really keep it clear.
[33:28.800 --> 33:30.020]  I'm getting Ericked a little bit.
[33:31.020 --> 33:32.620]  I'm trying to shoot backwards and drive forwards.
[33:33.320 --> 33:34.740]  Oh, he got me!
[33:34.940 --> 33:35.340]  I did it.
[33:35.340 --> 33:35.600]  It worked.
[33:38.560 --> 33:39.800]  No, Gavin!
[33:41.020 --> 33:42.660]  I was struggling as I was looking backwards.
[33:46.180 --> 33:47.980]  Oh, shit.
[33:48.320 --> 33:49.240]  That worked out great.
[33:49.240 --> 33:50.200]  Cover me.
[33:51.300 --> 33:51.660]  Covering.
[33:52.300 --> 33:54.500]  Oh, we've got a little Nat's bollock of health.
[33:54.640 --> 33:56.740]  How the fuck do I get down there?
[33:57.260 --> 33:58.540]  How do we get to him?
[33:58.700 --> 34:00.360]  I think we've got to have that one jump that they did.
[34:00.500 --> 34:02.080]  That was a brilliant move by Andrew.
[34:02.920 --> 34:04.580]  That ramp was such a jump scare.
[34:06.340 --> 34:08.320]  Why are you shooting me? Oh, shit.
[34:12.520 --> 34:13.060]  Get him!
[34:13.320 --> 34:13.340]  Die!
[34:14.320 --> 34:16.020]  I'm just moving him up closer.
[34:17.220 --> 34:18.660]  Yes! I think I got him!
[34:18.660 --> 34:20.020]  He did!
[34:20.160 --> 34:20.580]  Fuck!
[34:21.160 --> 34:21.360]  Yes!
[34:22.060 --> 34:22.560]  Andrew!
[34:23.080 --> 34:23.780]  Let's go out together!
[34:24.460 --> 34:25.040]  Push! Push!
[34:25.040 --> 34:25.560]  Push it!
[34:27.520 --> 34:28.020]  Yes!
[34:30.020 --> 34:31.920]  Alright, should we flip teams?
[34:32.660 --> 34:32.820]  Sure.
[34:32.900 --> 34:35.380]  I think that's the video, but let's do it.
[34:35.400 --> 34:36.060]  Let's flip teams.
[34:36.940 --> 34:38.180]  36 minute video?
[34:39.520 --> 34:39.980]  Yes.
[34:41.020 --> 34:41.880]  That many game types?
[34:42.040 --> 34:42.540]  Absolutely.
[34:43.500 --> 34:43.720]  Why?
[34:43.780 --> 34:43.860]  What?
[34:44.560 --> 34:45.200]  Hey, listen.
[34:45.300 --> 34:47.960]  We just played Trivia 40 or whatever the fuck.
[34:49.860 --> 34:52.100]  Also, Geoff put it on Lone Wolf Biker again.
[34:53.080 --> 34:54.980]  I'm just trying to switch it right now.
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.480]  I think I just hit next. I don't know why I put this on Lone Wolf Biker.
[35:01.440 --> 35:04.320]  Well, we might as well finish strong.
[35:05.220 --> 35:05.500]  Alright.
[35:06.420 --> 35:07.600]  Lone Wolf Biker, baby!
[35:07.940 --> 35:09.660]  Lone Wolf. Andrew's the lone wolf.
[35:10.800 --> 35:13.120]  We're going to do road bikes.
[35:13.120 --> 35:14.100]  Can you pick the gun or anything?
[35:15.360 --> 35:16.540]  Let's see. Weapons, all.
[35:17.280 --> 35:19.040]  Traffic, high. Pedestrians, high.
[35:20.000 --> 35:20.320]  Alright.
[35:21.600 --> 35:24.600]  Time of day, morning, day, midday.
[35:25.500 --> 35:27.680]  Voice chat, weather, clear.
[35:29.040 --> 35:29.720]  Okay, that's nice.
[35:29.880 --> 35:31.700]  Radio station, off. Kick player, off.
[35:31.820 --> 35:32.020]  Alright.
[35:32.780 --> 35:33.200]  Let's do it.
[35:39.100 --> 35:40.320]  Okay, not cool.
[35:41.280 --> 35:42.680]  I'm the Lone Wolf Biker.
[35:43.840 --> 35:44.940]  He's getting lit up.
[35:44.940 --> 35:45.100]  Not cool.
[35:45.140 --> 35:47.580]  How the fuck is he alive?
[35:48.580 --> 35:50.080]  Not cool, everybody.
[35:50.320 --> 35:52.580]  He's gone into a weird lone wolf persona.
[35:55.140 --> 35:56.860]  Why won't you die?
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.060]  Why won't he die? We've unloaded on that fool.
[36:00.820 --> 36:03.120]  You got a bloody mallet? What's going on?
[36:03.580 --> 36:05.380]  I got a bloody nose, is what I got.
[36:07.180 --> 36:07.660]  Batman?
[36:08.940 --> 36:10.180]  My parents are dead.
[36:10.480 --> 36:11.860]  Okay, so yeah, Batman.
[36:12.200 --> 36:13.460]  You're riddling me, Nick!
[36:13.960 --> 36:15.900]  I know, I can't let you have the kill.
[36:15.900 --> 36:17.580]  God damn you.
[36:22.570 --> 36:25.270]  Are you guys on that bridge?
[36:26.050 --> 36:27.030]  Hey Gavin, riddle me this.
[36:27.510 --> 36:28.090]  We were.
[36:28.710 --> 36:30.770]  Now we're just in the city.
[36:37.850 --> 36:39.870]  The same thing happened to me.
[36:39.950 --> 36:40.490]  Except I fell.
[36:41.470 --> 36:42.650]  Andrew is home free.
[36:42.950 --> 36:43.690]  Andrew's locked in.
[36:43.730 --> 36:44.310]  He's not even playing.
[36:45.210 --> 36:46.630]  He's playing to win.
[36:46.630 --> 36:47.910]  He's looking out for number one.
[36:47.930 --> 36:49.130]  He's cheating somehow.
[36:49.330 --> 36:50.870]  Yeah, he's just looking out for number one.
[36:51.670 --> 36:52.510]  Fucked it by killing Gavin.
[36:52.610 --> 36:53.070]  Sorry, Gavin.
[36:53.270 --> 36:55.810]  I definitely fucked it by being Geoff.
[36:59.910 --> 37:01.490]  He's the lone wolf biker.
[37:02.770 --> 37:05.970]  Editor, feel free to embarrass me by cutting to that.
[37:07.290 --> 37:08.970]  The lone wolf biker.
[37:09.730 --> 37:11.630]  His bike makes people miss.
[37:12.410 --> 37:13.890]  I thought you said his bike makes pee.
[37:14.450 --> 37:15.010]  No, no, no.
[37:15.030 --> 37:15.730]  Geoff, don't do it again.
[37:15.730 --> 37:17.070]  Please, be stupid once.
[37:17.370 --> 37:17.750]  That way.
[37:17.890 --> 37:19.070]  Be stupid a different way this time.
[37:22.050 --> 37:22.850]  Biking down.
[37:22.990 --> 37:23.770]  Oh, we can pincer him.
[37:23.970 --> 37:24.570]  We can pincer him.
[37:25.570 --> 37:26.370]  Like a pincer.
[37:28.590 --> 37:30.010]  Pincer the lone wolf biker.
[37:31.950 --> 37:33.430]  Boy, the voice is all over the place.
[37:34.290 --> 37:35.190]  Let me down.
[37:35.830 --> 37:36.410]  It's consistent.
[37:37.410 --> 37:38.370]  Ooh, could I snipe him?
[37:38.850 --> 37:39.250]  No!
[37:41.370 --> 37:41.770]  No!
[37:42.190 --> 37:42.570]  Sorry, Nick.
[37:42.570 --> 37:42.770]  What?
[37:43.050 --> 37:44.110]  It appears that the answer is no.
[37:44.110 --> 37:44.950]  Ah, I hit someone!
[37:45.050 --> 37:45.490]  I hit a person!
[37:45.770 --> 37:46.510]  Ah, I hit a car!
[37:51.930 --> 37:52.930]  What's going to happen here?
[37:53.770 --> 37:54.670]  I don't know.
[37:56.010 --> 37:56.610]  About to beat zero.
[37:57.110 --> 37:58.650]  The lone wolf biker is stuck on some cardboard.
[37:59.810 --> 38:00.410]  Oh, there you go.
[38:00.690 --> 38:01.150]  Eric got him.
[38:05.870 --> 38:06.990]  What is blowing up?
[38:07.610 --> 38:08.190]  Lots of stuff.
[38:11.230 --> 38:14.390]  I was going to run over and pull you off your bike.
[38:16.730 --> 38:17.190]  Get off me!
[38:18.210 --> 38:19.150]  Let me out of here!
[38:20.910 --> 38:22.070]  We only have safety!
[38:22.710 --> 38:23.070]  Kill him!
[38:23.070 --> 38:23.730]  Kill him!
[38:23.750 --> 38:24.730]  We only have safety!
[38:28.510 --> 38:29.070]  Where'd he go?
[38:29.330 --> 38:29.710]  There he is.
[38:31.630 --> 38:32.030]  Shit.
[38:33.030 --> 38:33.850]  He's under the bridge!
[38:34.130 --> 38:34.870]  He's under the bridge!
[38:35.110 --> 38:36.050]  He's a biker troll!
[38:37.730 --> 38:39.450]  There's no under the bridge part.
[38:39.990 --> 38:40.750]  Yeah, there's really not.
[38:40.770 --> 38:41.290]  Down in the water!
[38:41.290 --> 38:41.670]  Ah!
[38:42.890 --> 38:45.090]  Oh no, Nick!
[38:46.290 --> 38:47.370]  Fish in a barrel!
[38:48.430 --> 38:49.390]  Get him!
[38:49.750 --> 38:51.390]  How do I fight in the water?
[38:51.910 --> 38:54.270]  This is the worst possible outcome!
[38:54.850 --> 38:59.790]  How the fuck did you become the...
[38:59.790 --> 39:01.670]  Dammit, look unto the right person!
[39:03.590 --> 39:04.130]  Did you move?
[39:04.150 --> 39:04.870]  Just die!
[39:06.410 --> 39:07.150]  Ow!
[39:08.630 --> 39:09.390]  Yes!
[39:10.450 --> 39:11.330]  Run away!
[39:13.890 --> 39:14.670]  Please, sir!
[39:14.870 --> 39:15.790]  Leave me be!
[39:16.230 --> 39:16.830]  I'm a...
[39:16.830 --> 39:17.250]  I'm...
[39:17.250 --> 39:18.070]  Help me!
[39:19.450 --> 39:21.130]  You can't even do a bit!
[39:22.370 --> 39:23.630]  Nope, I was too scared.
[39:23.910 --> 39:24.990]  You shot the bit out of him.
[39:25.690 --> 39:26.050]  Oh yeah.
[39:27.430 --> 39:28.610]  I've gone the wrong way!
[39:28.750 --> 39:29.730]  Riddled his bit out.
[39:31.390 --> 39:32.490]  Hey, let go of my bit.
[39:41.250 --> 39:42.600]  Damn this driving!
[39:44.230 --> 39:44.770]  You...
[39:46.890 --> 39:49.570]  I don't want to hear it, so don't let you!
[39:50.870 --> 39:51.950]  It's glidey!
[39:54.350 --> 39:58.430]  Oh no, it didn't work!
[39:58.670 --> 39:59.310]  It didn't work!
[39:59.570 --> 40:00.510]  It didn't work!
[40:00.550 --> 40:01.990]  That was a hell of a move.
[40:02.490 --> 40:05.730]  How many bullets does it take to kill you?
[40:06.070 --> 40:07.950]  Oh, there we go.
[40:08.090 --> 40:08.530]  What?
[40:08.890 --> 40:10.150]  Oh, I gotta go. See you guys later.
[40:10.430 --> 40:10.990]  I gotta go.
[40:11.130 --> 40:11.570]  Get him!
[40:12.730 --> 40:16.070]  Oh, Geoff's plan of fucking up and then arriving at the right time worked really well!
[40:16.130 --> 40:18.710]  I'm an alone wolf biker. I prefer to be alone.
[40:19.690 --> 40:21.130]  God damn the fence!
[40:22.210 --> 40:23.170]  Ow, bullshit!
[40:24.470 --> 40:24.910]  Shit.
[40:26.690 --> 40:27.430]  Get away!
[40:28.170 --> 40:29.350]  He doesn't have a tire, he's fucked.
[40:29.870 --> 40:30.670]  Get away!
[40:31.790 --> 40:33.750]  Thank you, Nick. Thanks for killing me, Nick.
[40:33.850 --> 40:37.270]  Sorry, Geoff. I was shooting Andrew the whole time, I just wanted to be...
[40:37.770 --> 40:39.850]  Well, you were standing in front of Andrew, so yeah.
[40:40.150 --> 40:40.670]  Andrew, kill him.
[40:41.670 --> 40:42.070]  No.
[40:42.610 --> 40:43.030]  Andrew's dead.
[40:43.390 --> 40:44.190]  My tire!
[40:44.730 --> 40:46.410]  God damn it, Eric, what are you doing to me?
[40:46.930 --> 40:47.750]  Hanging out in a car!
[40:51.470 --> 40:52.270]  Get him!
[40:52.830 --> 40:53.790]  Oh my god!
[40:54.070 --> 40:54.830]  Who's the man?
[40:56.210 --> 40:57.010]  It's Geoff!
[40:57.330 --> 40:58.490]  Geoff's the man now, dog!
[41:00.230 --> 41:02.150]  I'm Sean Connery from that movie.
[41:02.890 --> 41:03.290]  Yeah.
[41:03.330 --> 41:04.910]  He found Forresta.
[41:06.650 --> 41:07.790]  Always the last place you look.
[41:08.230 --> 41:08.830]  Alright, here I come.
[41:09.270 --> 41:11.130]  Oh no, this is bad. This is bad for Geoff.
[41:11.330 --> 41:12.130]  Yep, here I come!
[41:12.450 --> 41:13.330]  Pretty hemmed in there.
[41:13.970 --> 41:14.690]  Bye, bastards!
[41:16.750 --> 41:17.750]  Eat my asshole!
[41:19.870 --> 41:21.770]  It's okay, he'll crash in the river any minute now.
[41:23.130 --> 41:23.930]  The ambulance!
[41:24.370 --> 41:26.670]  Oh, he fell!
[41:27.070 --> 41:27.650]  Murder him!
[41:28.490 --> 41:29.510]  Gotta go!
[41:30.710 --> 41:31.930]  The fence!
[41:33.550 --> 41:34.990]  Our greatest weakness!
[41:37.410 --> 41:39.230]  Damn that wall!
[41:43.990 --> 41:44.830]  He's gaining.
[41:45.730 --> 41:47.650]  That was pretty cool.
[41:48.170 --> 41:49.750]  That was awesome, did you see that?
[41:50.550 --> 41:50.810]  Geoff!
[41:51.210 --> 41:52.510]  It happens, it happens.
[41:56.890 --> 41:58.350]  Why am I upside down?
[41:59.450 --> 42:00.730]  It happens!
[42:01.970 --> 42:03.930]  Oh damn, he just said that.
[42:04.950 --> 42:06.030]  Ah, the bridge!
[42:10.130 --> 42:11.450]  I gotta get out of here.
[42:12.170 --> 42:13.750]  I gotta get out of here.
[42:16.410 --> 42:17.510]  Oh, I'm getting you out.
[42:17.750 --> 42:18.090]  Do it, make the jump!
[42:18.470 --> 42:20.610]  Oh, it's me!
[42:20.930 --> 42:21.410]  No!
[42:23.110 --> 42:23.590]  No!
[42:24.310 --> 42:25.690]  Oh goddammit, he's up there.
[42:30.410 --> 42:30.930]  Oh!
[42:34.940 --> 42:35.780]  It's Andrew!
[42:36.600 --> 42:36.760]  Fuck it!
[42:37.180 --> 42:37.660]  Fuck it!
[42:37.980 --> 42:38.520]  Fuck it!
[42:38.640 --> 42:39.320]  He's going for it!
[42:39.480 --> 42:40.940]  He's going up the ledge!
[42:42.240 --> 42:43.720]  Did you live?
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.180]  Oh my god, that's high.
[42:47.020 --> 42:49.240]  Was not as effective as I would have hoped.
[42:49.880 --> 42:52.420]  And we're right back to where we started a minute ago.
[42:52.920 --> 42:53.980]  That was toxic sludge.
[42:55.500 --> 42:55.780]  Okay.
[42:57.200 --> 42:59.280]  I ran over Geoff like a speed pump.
[42:59.820 --> 43:00.140]  Shit!
[43:00.620 --> 43:01.840]  Oh, Nick, good shooting!
[43:02.140 --> 43:02.560]  Thank you!
[43:06.420 --> 43:07.040]  We're gonna get him.
[43:08.280 --> 43:09.420]  No touchy, no touchy.
[43:13.260 --> 43:15.360]  Oh god, oh god, I just see the blips, I see them.
[43:18.420 --> 43:20.680]  Do you guys think this would look better if we played it on PC?
[43:22.260 --> 43:22.780]  I don't know.
[43:22.960 --> 43:23.760]  I don't know, ask Gavin.
[43:25.560 --> 43:26.880]  I don't know, he didn't say anything beforehand.
[43:27.400 --> 43:27.760]  That's true.
[43:27.840 --> 43:28.620]  How do you switch to weapon?
[43:29.600 --> 43:29.900]  B?
[43:30.720 --> 43:31.040]  X.
[43:31.140 --> 43:31.460]  X.
[43:32.380 --> 43:35.080]  Sorry, I was playing Switch, you know?
[43:35.540 --> 43:38.100]  They just kind of like mix up the letters or whatever where they go, you know?
[43:38.220 --> 43:40.040]  I'm out of weapon, I need to pick up a weapon.
[43:40.620 --> 43:41.940]  It's confidently wrong.
[43:42.260 --> 43:44.440]  Well, that's how we started this company.
[43:45.920 --> 43:47.520]  I figured I'd get one.
[43:52.580 --> 43:53.300]  Ah, truck!
[43:56.880 --> 43:57.680]  Dammit, Nick!
[43:59.200 --> 44:02.300]  Dude, this truck. I just did a front flip.
[44:02.880 --> 44:04.980]  Where is it? Where is it? Where's the road?
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.860]  Wait, is it on the bridge?
[44:07.940 --> 44:08.980]  Oh, there! Checkpoint!
[44:10.500 --> 44:11.300]  What the hell am I...
[44:18.700 --> 44:19.400]  Cook me!
[44:21.340 --> 44:22.100]  The wolf.
[44:24.060 --> 44:24.820]  Ah, woman!
[44:27.280 --> 44:28.460]  Oh, bad. Things are bad.
[44:29.120 --> 44:29.780]  This sucks.
[44:30.460 --> 44:31.240]  Are you down there?
[44:31.920 --> 44:32.740]  No, I'm not anywhere.
[44:34.020 --> 44:35.360]  He looks like he's down there.
[44:37.260 --> 44:38.860]  Seems like he might be down there.
[44:38.940 --> 44:40.240]  Guys, I think Nick might be down there.
[44:40.800 --> 44:43.000]  I'm hearing reports that he's down there.
[44:43.020 --> 44:43.700]  I'm up here now!
[44:44.860 --> 44:45.580]  Nope, he's up.
[44:46.240 --> 44:46.720]  He's up there.
[44:47.300 --> 44:47.920]  I'm up there!
[44:48.340 --> 44:49.140]  I'm down where?
[44:52.540 --> 44:54.160]  I think I'm on him.
[44:54.500 --> 44:56.160]  I think I'm narrowing in on him.
[44:57.160 --> 44:59.160]  Why is every pickup going apeshit?
[45:00.380 --> 45:02.260]  Oh, I see the pickup that's going apeshit.
[45:03.500 --> 45:04.660]  Oh no, I missed the bridge!
[45:04.660 --> 45:06.560]  No, I missed the turn!
[45:07.160 --> 45:07.260]  Oh!
[45:08.820 --> 45:11.120]  Okay, it's okay. It's alright. It's okay.
[45:11.600 --> 45:12.080]  Panic!
[45:15.730 --> 45:16.690]  Oh, the ground!
[45:17.290 --> 45:18.350]  Oh my god.
[45:19.150 --> 45:19.790]  Oh, the ground.
[45:19.830 --> 45:19.990]  Pardon me.
[45:22.030 --> 45:24.630]  Lone wolf biker driving a small truck.
[45:27.930 --> 45:28.710]  Light that truck up.
[45:30.310 --> 45:33.330]  Clearly I'm not the lone wolf biker, guys. I'm in a truck.
[45:33.330 --> 45:36.630]  Oh, the truck's on fire! The truck's on fire!
[45:39.450 --> 45:43.690]  Oh, knock me off the bike!
[45:46.760 --> 45:47.060]  Please!
[45:52.040 --> 45:59.290]  Oh, there's a man.
[46:01.570 --> 46:03.170]  Why is there always a man?
[46:03.170 --> 46:07.510]  Oh, it blew me off again!
[46:10.450 --> 46:12.110]  Here, Geoff. I gotcha.
[46:12.170 --> 46:13.190]  Come here.
[46:19.570 --> 46:21.210]  Oh, didn't kill me.
[46:21.510 --> 46:21.650]  Okay.
[46:22.530 --> 46:22.970]  Anyway.
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.560]  Oh my god.
[46:33.280 --> 46:33.680]  Got him!
[46:35.760 --> 46:38.260]  This fucking car is pinning me!
[46:40.780 --> 46:43.080]  So close to the end. Sneak it, sneak it, sneak it.
[46:43.200 --> 46:43.860]  No, no sneaky.
[46:44.260 --> 46:45.180]  Oh my god.
[46:47.100 --> 46:48.240]  Everything's bad for Eric.
[46:49.940 --> 46:50.500]  Time to take her.
[46:50.540 --> 46:51.100]  Where'd he go?
[46:51.460 --> 46:52.340]  Time to take myself out of the game.
[46:52.700 --> 46:53.620]  See you boys in hell.
[46:54.880 --> 46:55.500]  Okay, I'll get him.
[46:56.700 --> 46:57.080]  Eric's dead.
[46:58.800 --> 46:59.080]  Andrew!
[46:59.500 --> 47:01.060]  Don't get me, don't get me, don't get me, don't get me, don't get me.
[47:01.100 --> 47:04.100]  I need to get on a new bike because my old bike got shot up real good because you got shot up.
[47:04.100 --> 47:04.700]  Stop it.
[47:07.600 --> 47:08.280]  No!
[47:08.620 --> 47:09.780]  Mickey Mouse ass.
[47:10.440 --> 47:11.080]  What the fuck?
[47:12.140 --> 47:13.480]  You can't catch me.
[47:14.660 --> 47:15.500]  I have a billion dollar industry.
[47:20.810 --> 47:24.330]  As Mickey Mouse's want to say often.
[47:24.610 --> 47:25.890]  I have a billion dollar industry.
[47:27.930 --> 47:29.550]  Have you watched my Clubhouse show?
[47:30.230 --> 47:31.530]  Oh, fuck me.
[47:32.090 --> 47:33.810]  Oh god.
[47:34.750 --> 47:35.970]  Oh, that hurt.
[47:35.970 --> 47:37.150]  That hurt my pride.
[47:40.230 --> 47:40.850]  I don't know where to go.
[47:41.150 --> 47:41.670]  I don't know where I'm going.
[47:42.290 --> 47:43.010]  Oh, the map.
[47:44.490 --> 47:44.790]  Okay.
[47:45.630 --> 47:46.350]  Gotta cross a bridge.
[47:47.890 --> 47:48.990]  Oh my god.
[47:50.290 --> 47:51.030]  Ah, the car!
[47:51.330 --> 47:51.930]  No, the car!
[47:52.390 --> 47:53.330]  Oh, the car!
[47:54.230 --> 47:54.690]  Uh oh.
[47:55.830 --> 47:56.150]  Uh oh.
[47:56.290 --> 47:57.530]  Please don't be passing any bridges.
[48:02.910 --> 48:03.390]  Uh oh.
[48:04.050 --> 48:05.490]  I'm so out of it at this point.
[48:05.490 --> 48:06.110]  It's me!
[48:06.270 --> 48:06.810]  I need to loop around.
[48:07.830 --> 48:08.230]  It's Gavin!
[48:08.230 --> 48:09.110]  Oh, come on!
[48:09.210 --> 48:09.490]  No.
[48:11.870 --> 48:12.730]  Let's get him!
[48:14.130 --> 48:14.370]  I'm trying.
[48:14.530 --> 48:15.530]  I'm like six blocks away.
[48:18.530 --> 48:20.790]  Oh, you sneaky peep.
[48:20.930 --> 48:21.490]  Look at you.
[48:22.790 --> 48:24.170]  I'm bouncing off every wall.
[48:25.450 --> 48:26.890]  I could have gone the right direction.
[48:28.630 --> 48:29.310]  Are you close?
[48:29.850 --> 48:30.450]  Are you running?
[48:31.030 --> 48:31.530]  Oh.
[48:31.870 --> 48:35.070]  They're just running around in fucking back alley circles.
[48:36.690 --> 48:37.830]  Playing grab ass.
[48:38.750 --> 48:39.390]  Hell yeah.
[48:39.630 --> 48:41.030]  Looking to buy a hand job.
[48:44.430 --> 48:45.450]  Excuse me.
[48:45.450 --> 48:46.930]  The lone wolfer.
[48:47.210 --> 48:48.270]  The lone wolfer.
[48:48.730 --> 48:49.650]  The lone wolfer.
[48:49.850 --> 48:50.470]  Excuse me.
[48:50.770 --> 48:52.470]  You familiar with Handsome Johnny's?
[48:53.710 --> 48:54.410]  Front flip!
[48:55.030 --> 48:55.130]  Ah!
[48:55.350 --> 48:56.470]  Eric, your bike!
[48:57.650 --> 48:58.750]  I got...
[48:58.750 --> 49:00.170]  A car just got in my way.
[49:01.210 --> 49:01.750]  Wait a minute.
[49:03.470 --> 49:04.670]  Oh, fiddles fuck!
[49:04.690 --> 49:05.590]  I'm almost back into this.
[49:06.630 --> 49:07.750]  Fiddles fuck.
[49:07.750 --> 49:07.970]  Fiddles fuck.
[49:09.030 --> 49:10.150]  Ah, fiddles.
[49:10.430 --> 49:11.230]  Oh, shit.
[49:11.230 --> 49:11.850]  Ah!
[49:12.670 --> 49:13.150]  Ah!
[49:15.150 --> 49:16.790]  Above me or below me?
[49:16.790 --> 49:17.530]  God damn it.
[49:17.710 --> 49:19.430]  I abandoned fiddle sticks halfway through.
[49:20.950 --> 49:22.250]  Put me on the bike.
[49:23.450 --> 49:24.410]  Who's that in the water?
[49:24.430 --> 49:24.870]  Hey, uh.
[49:25.250 --> 49:26.030]  Will you kill me?
[49:26.410 --> 49:26.650]  Gavin.
[49:28.630 --> 49:30.370]  Gavin took a little shortcut across.
[49:31.170 --> 49:32.790]  I was so close to you guys.
[49:32.910 --> 49:33.950]  I almost made it all the way over.
[49:34.270 --> 49:34.650]  Give me this.
[49:35.930 --> 49:37.410]  Give me this goddamn...
[49:37.410 --> 49:37.810]  Goddamn.
[49:44.480 --> 49:46.780]  I'm so close to being back in the action.
[49:47.040 --> 49:48.070]  Nah, I don't think so.
[49:49.180 --> 49:49.740]  A helicopter!
[49:50.100 --> 49:50.420]  Perfect.
[49:52.200 --> 49:53.600]  Nah, a helicopter's a good idea.
[49:54.080 --> 49:54.920]  That's a great idea.
[49:54.960 --> 49:56.180]  I'm gonna go get that little son of a bitch.
[49:56.200 --> 49:57.600]  Where the fuck did you guys go?
[49:57.900 --> 49:58.280]  Whoa!
[49:59.100 --> 50:00.480]  Oh, you flippin' him.
[50:04.150 --> 50:04.530]  Gagalaglag.
[50:05.550 --> 50:05.930]  What?
[50:07.470 --> 50:07.850]  Gagalaglag.
[50:08.050 --> 50:09.030]  I believe you said gagalaglag.
[50:10.390 --> 50:11.790]  No, it's locked!
[50:12.010 --> 50:12.350]  No!
[50:12.350 --> 50:15.710]  I just wanted an opportunity to fly.
[50:17.190 --> 50:18.470]  It's locked on both sides.
[50:19.050 --> 50:20.370]  Where the fuck did the little Eric go?
[50:20.790 --> 50:22.170]  Could you shoot the window open?
[50:23.470 --> 50:24.170]  I jumped off.
[50:24.770 --> 50:24.830]  Oh.
[50:33.360 --> 50:35.080]  Are you a lone wolf now, Eric?
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.100]  The wolf is loose, baby!
[50:38.160 --> 50:39.740]  Oh no, I got derolled!
[50:40.980 --> 50:43.340]  You better kill yourselves to get close to me!
[50:43.480 --> 50:44.740]  I'm in the wind!
[50:45.380 --> 50:47.140]  Andrew just drove past me in a boat.
[50:47.720 --> 50:50.540]  I've been trying to get to the action for ten minutes!
[50:53.600 --> 50:55.740]  Oh, now they're back where I was!
[50:56.360 --> 50:56.800]  Yeah.
[51:00.700 --> 51:01.580]  Aw, man.
[51:01.860 --> 51:03.340]  I just crossed the river!
[51:04.320 --> 51:05.180]  Fuck this.
[51:05.620 --> 51:08.720]  Eric, you can get off your bike down to ten and then get back on it and you can go.
[51:11.660 --> 51:11.940]  Wait, what?
[51:11.940 --> 51:14.400]  Aw, he put me under the bridges on silly bullets!
[51:20.140 --> 51:20.620]  Great.
[51:21.020 --> 51:22.220]  Going back across the river.
[51:22.880 --> 51:25.220]  I was gonna go check out the Statue of Liberty.
[51:25.580 --> 51:26.400]  I fucking give up.
[51:27.180 --> 51:28.880]  This is why we do it wolf style, baby!
[51:30.460 --> 51:32.900]  I'm gonna check the sights out at least.
[51:35.100 --> 51:35.900]  It's hot!
[51:36.560 --> 51:37.360]  It's so hot!
[51:39.240 --> 51:40.180]  Good luck, amigo!
[51:41.560 --> 51:43.260]  I'm doing wolf tricks!
[51:47.820 --> 51:49.840]  I miss when Eric was chasing us.
[51:50.000 --> 51:50.900]  That was fun.
[51:50.960 --> 51:51.480]  Wolf point!
[51:53.180 --> 51:54.020]  Wolf point!
[51:55.420 --> 51:57.260]  Why can't anyone take him out?
[51:57.460 --> 51:58.660]  Cause I'm the wolf, baby!
[51:59.760 --> 52:01.060]  Cause I went for a swim!
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.220]  After your little maneuver.
[52:05.520 --> 52:06.960]  The wolf's in the wind, baby!
[52:08.280 --> 52:09.960]  Gavin, how many times are you gonna die?
[52:10.220 --> 52:11.720]  I keep getting put under him.
[52:13.080 --> 52:14.500]  That's the power of the wolf!
[52:18.240 --> 52:20.500]  Okay, don't get close to the wolf now.
[52:20.560 --> 52:20.920]  Thank you.
[52:21.100 --> 52:21.780]  That's enough.
[52:22.340 --> 52:23.440]  Why don't you hit something?
[52:23.640 --> 52:24.580]  Stay away from the wolf.
[52:24.660 --> 52:25.400]  Thank you.
[52:25.880 --> 52:26.940]  Stay away from the wolf.
[52:27.040 --> 52:27.680]  Thank you.
[52:30.680 --> 52:33.020]  Oh, the wolf is dangerously close.
[52:33.960 --> 52:35.120]  Everyone's closing in on the wolf!
[52:39.020 --> 52:40.520]  The wolf doesn't like it!
[52:41.420 --> 52:42.680]  I just want a nice view.
[52:44.200 --> 52:47.100]  Andrew, you could have rejoined the hunt by now.
[52:47.900 --> 52:50.280]  I spent so long trying to get to that hunt.
[52:50.760 --> 52:52.300]  Well, it came back to you!
[52:52.740 --> 52:55.860]  Yeah, and then I crossed the river, and then it came back to me, and then I...
[52:56.920 --> 52:57.620]  Excuse me?
[52:58.660 --> 53:03.860]  You gotta enjoy the small moments in life, Nick.
[53:04.020 --> 53:06.000]  That's why I'm seeing the Statue of Liberty.
[53:07.680 --> 53:08.880]  Is that a small moment?
[53:09.660 --> 53:09.940]  Yep.
[53:11.500 --> 53:13.120]  For the lone wolf biker's life.
[53:14.220 --> 53:16.020]  The wolf is loose, baby!
[53:16.680 --> 53:17.640]  I'm on him!
[53:19.540 --> 53:21.360]  I'm dicking him! Real good!
[53:26.260 --> 53:27.780]  This is a great straightaway! That prick!
[53:31.640 --> 53:33.120]  Well, bad news, Geoff.
[53:40.300 --> 53:46.880]  I put some bullets into him, but he's fast. He's a quick little wolf.
[53:46.880 --> 53:48.800]  No one can stop the wolf!
[53:51.100 --> 53:52.520]  He's got, like, wolf nos.
[53:53.320 --> 53:54.920]  He's going so fast.
[53:59.430 --> 54:01.270]  You blow up that car.
[54:02.630 --> 54:06.110]  Well, I just set it on fire, and then I stand by the fire.
[54:08.990 --> 54:10.210]  Ah, damn it!
[54:10.850 --> 54:11.810]  Whoa, what happened there?
[54:12.170 --> 54:13.470]  Geoff took it over.
[54:13.970 --> 54:15.090]  The dot went apeshit.
[54:16.610 --> 54:18.810]  Gavin is the wolf! Gavin is the wolf! Repeat!
[54:18.810 --> 54:19.950]  Gavin is the wolf!
[54:20.530 --> 54:21.150]  It's not true.
[54:21.430 --> 54:22.270]  He's the wolf!
[54:23.550 --> 54:23.970]  Kill Gavin.
[54:23.970 --> 54:24.650]  Geoff's the wolf.
[54:24.670 --> 54:25.490]  Geoff's the wolf!
[54:28.010 --> 54:31.850]  Oh my god, I'm getting a boost!
[54:36.810 --> 54:38.450]  What's everyone doing in here?
[54:38.990 --> 54:40.210]  Fucking not escaping.
[54:40.850 --> 54:41.810]  God damn it.
[54:42.350 --> 54:43.150]  Oh, it's him again!
[54:44.890 --> 54:45.770]  He's climbing!
[54:51.040 --> 54:52.220]  No mercy!
[54:52.620 --> 54:53.060]  He's in the car!
[54:53.810 --> 54:54.220]  No!
[54:56.240 --> 54:57.240]  Geoff's the wolf!
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.280]  Why am I on the train tracks?
[55:00.500 --> 55:01.880]  Geoff, you...
[55:01.880 --> 55:03.380]  Why is the door shut?
[55:04.060 --> 55:05.040]  Jesus Christ!
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.400]  Wolf from above!
[55:08.660 --> 55:09.360]  Oh, Eric!
[55:11.420 --> 55:13.160]  Wolf wheelie go!
[55:14.860 --> 55:16.180]  Eight seconds!
[55:17.880 --> 55:18.360]  Five.
[55:18.520 --> 55:19.180]  Ride that bull!
[55:20.200 --> 55:20.700]  Three.
[55:21.440 --> 55:22.040]  Time it!
[55:22.180 --> 55:22.260]  Two.
[55:22.880 --> 55:23.300]  One.
[55:23.420 --> 55:23.900]  Ah!
[55:24.260 --> 55:24.740]  Nick!
[55:25.260 --> 55:26.060]  I win.
[55:26.920 --> 55:27.460]  Oh, I won!
[55:27.600 --> 55:28.340]  Nick won!
