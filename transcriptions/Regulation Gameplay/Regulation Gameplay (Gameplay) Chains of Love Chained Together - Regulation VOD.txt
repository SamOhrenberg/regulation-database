[00:00.000 --> 00:01.980]  All right, audience, so there's five of us,
[00:02.040 --> 00:05.080]  but you can only play four players in chain together.
[00:05.380 --> 00:09.820]  And the way we've decided to deal with that, knowing that Nick is the one
[00:09.820 --> 00:12.060]  that has to stream this every time because he's the only one
[00:12.060 --> 00:13.180]  that knows what the fuck he's doing,
[00:13.640 --> 00:16.340]  that Eric has created a wheel with our four names on it.
[00:16.380 --> 00:17.220]  We're going to spin it.
[00:17.380 --> 00:19.840]  If the wheel lands on you, you are in the game.
[00:20.400 --> 00:22.100]  Why does it look like a flesh wheel?
[00:22.880 --> 00:25.220]  It asked me if I wanted to change the colors.
[00:25.380 --> 00:27.200]  I had it like regular colors.
[00:27.460 --> 00:29.260]  And it's like, do you want to change it to match the logo?
[00:29.260 --> 00:30.300]  And I said, yes.
[00:30.460 --> 00:33.700]  So you picked like, what would it look like if someone rolled down a hill?
[00:34.020 --> 00:35.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:35.800 --> 00:37.480]  I would not say this is the color palette.
[00:37.520 --> 00:40.080]  You'll see the rolling down the hill in real time here
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.740]  in just a second when we spin the wheel.
[00:42.140 --> 00:42.980]  I think it's going to be great.
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.860]  OK, if it lands on your name, you are removed from the wheel and in the game.
[00:49.020 --> 00:50.540]  Are you guys ready for our spins?
[00:50.940 --> 00:53.320]  I cannot wait to not be in the game.
[00:53.760 --> 00:55.640]  Yeah, let's get some piss rats if everyone's ready.
[00:55.800 --> 00:57.300]  Corn cats only in the chat, only corn cats.
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.040]  OK, here we go.
[00:58.040 --> 01:01.040]  First spin, first spins coming through.
[01:01.600 --> 01:02.600]  Not me, not me.
[01:02.820 --> 01:03.840]  Don't land on me, don't land on me.
[01:04.060 --> 01:05.620]  No! Fuck you!
[01:07.200 --> 01:07.640]  Ahhhh!
[01:09.380 --> 01:09.820]  Yeah!
[01:11.020 --> 01:11.120]  Whoa!
[01:12.340 --> 01:15.080]  Eric has been shamed to hell.
[01:15.600 --> 01:16.840]  God damn it.
[01:17.080 --> 01:18.980]  It's because I see piss rats in the chat.
[01:19.320 --> 01:21.060]  Big piece of pie right there.
[01:21.300 --> 01:22.140]  All right, here we go.
[01:22.500 --> 01:24.080]  You guys ready? You guys ready to see who's next?
[01:24.520 --> 01:25.680]  Yeah. All right, here we go.
[01:26.500 --> 01:27.340]  Here comes Andrew.
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.720]  Not me, no, not me.
[01:28.860 --> 01:29.680]  I'm, uh, nope.
[01:30.020 --> 01:30.840]  There goes Andrew.
[01:31.260 --> 01:32.360]  Here comes Gavin!
[01:33.480 --> 01:33.840]  Hey!
[01:35.180 --> 01:38.720]  Gavin, if you want to go ahead and start that game so that way, you can be first.
[01:39.220 --> 01:40.340]  Yeah, you wanted to be first.
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.420]  Now, this is going to be a little bit different this time.
[01:42.520 --> 01:43.580]  We're doing checkpoints.
[01:44.020 --> 01:46.240]  Go ahead and invite Eric for that game.
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.180]  Yeah. Remember, remember to set it to easy, not to normal or whatever,
[01:51.340 --> 01:52.620]  because we need to get those checkpoints.
[01:52.880 --> 01:53.440]  Yeah. Yes.
[01:53.660 --> 01:54.500]  Beginner mode, beginner mode.
[01:54.500 --> 01:56.960]  OK, guys, here it is.
[01:57.540 --> 01:58.420]  This is the whole thing.
[01:58.540 --> 02:00.340]  Who is in and who is out?
[02:00.680 --> 02:01.700]  I don't want to be in.
[02:01.880 --> 02:02.560]  It begins now.
[02:03.140 --> 02:04.300]  Let's spin! Go!
[02:04.860 --> 02:05.880]  I want to pop in next one.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.200]  It's going to be Andrew.
[02:07.640 --> 02:08.660]  And then I'm going to have to...
[02:08.660 --> 02:09.620]  All right, you guys.
[02:10.240 --> 02:10.740]  That's it.
[02:10.940 --> 02:12.380]  You guys have a great weekend.
[02:12.780 --> 02:13.940]  I think you're going to be awesome.
[02:14.280 --> 02:15.080]  What the fuck?
[02:15.280 --> 02:16.300]  I'm going to be a fan.
[02:16.460 --> 02:17.540]  I'm going to be here watching it.
[02:17.800 --> 02:19.760]  I had a feeling I wasn't going to be playing today.
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.000]  Can't say that I'm upset about it,
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.780]  but I am excited to watch you guys play.
[02:25.120 --> 02:25.740]  Geoff is...
[02:25.740 --> 02:28.460]  Geoff is the one who doesn't have to play.
[02:28.460 --> 02:29.060]  God damn it.
[02:30.420 --> 02:30.900]  Unbelievable.
[02:32.440 --> 02:32.920]  Unbelievable.
[02:33.140 --> 02:34.800]  Hey, I was prepared to play.
[02:34.940 --> 02:36.300]  I figured I would play,
[02:36.440 --> 02:38.160]  but this is the way you guys wanted to do it.
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.520]  So we got to adhere to the rules.
[02:40.400 --> 02:42.280]  I'm nothing if not a rule follower,
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.700]  so I will abdicate my ability to play this game to y'all.
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.220]  It's the...
[02:48.220 --> 02:49.620]  What do you guys call it?
[02:49.620 --> 02:50.440]  It's the...
[02:50.440 --> 02:51.440]  It's the heist crew.
[02:52.340 --> 02:53.460]  Have at it.
[02:54.140 --> 02:57.540]  Every authority in the history of your life has just...
[02:57.540 --> 02:59.440]  You pierce their heart.
[02:59.800 --> 03:00.800]  Geoff is claiming,
[03:01.260 --> 03:02.400]  I am a rule follower.
[03:02.920 --> 03:04.400]  As a no-rule follower.
[03:06.020 --> 03:06.920]  Alright, the lobby's up.
[03:07.160 --> 03:07.300]  God.
[03:08.080 --> 03:09.160]  This is crazy.
[03:09.680 --> 03:11.020]  Alright, Gavin, how you feeling about it?
[03:11.060 --> 03:11.340]  You ready?
[03:11.840 --> 03:12.640]  Good. You're a woman?
[03:13.280 --> 03:13.580]  Yeah.
[03:14.140 --> 03:14.580]  Mixed it up.
[03:14.640 --> 03:15.700]  I didn't even see that skin.
[03:16.280 --> 03:16.540]  I'm...
[03:17.040 --> 03:17.520]  I'm...
[03:18.120 --> 03:19.640]  I'm beautiful and I'm ready to escape hell.
[03:21.120 --> 03:22.280]  Well, here we go.
[03:22.320 --> 03:22.760]  Okay.
[03:23.140 --> 03:24.460]  Hey, best of luck, guys.
[03:24.720 --> 03:25.020]  Alright, we're moving.
[03:25.380 --> 03:26.460]  I want you to not believe in you.
[03:27.000 --> 03:27.900]  Gavin's in the front.
[03:28.480 --> 03:29.200]  Gavin's in the front.
[03:29.480 --> 03:31.660]  It's amazing. It's tremendous.
[03:32.220 --> 03:34.120]  Are you guys coming or...
[03:34.120 --> 03:34.500]  What's going on?
[03:35.000 --> 03:36.000]  Hold on. Okay, there we go.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.080]  I had to get my controller to work.
[03:37.260 --> 03:38.720]  You know, everything just breaks sometimes.
[03:38.960 --> 03:40.400]  Andrew does not appear to be coming.
[03:41.100 --> 03:41.580]  Andrew doesn't want to.
[03:41.580 --> 03:43.480]  I'm getting my controller to work.
[03:44.060 --> 03:45.300]  Give me a moment.
[03:45.860 --> 03:47.140]  No one's ready.
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.520]  I don't know.
[03:49.460 --> 03:50.800]  Everything was broken.
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.380]  I don't think anything was broken. I think everything was working.
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.540]  Well, normally we're in the game before we start the stream.
[03:57.060 --> 03:57.620]  That's funny.
[03:58.300 --> 03:59.940]  I was in the game. Mine worked, right?
[04:00.380 --> 04:01.140]  Geoff, you saw it.
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.460]  Yeah, and I'll be honest with you.
[04:03.520 --> 04:07.540]  I was ready to play, too, when we spun the wheel because I understood that was part of it.
[04:07.880 --> 04:08.020]  Yeah.
[04:08.100 --> 04:09.000]  Next time...
[04:09.500 --> 04:10.920]  Next time, Eric can run the stream.
[04:12.640 --> 04:13.440]  Andrew's just...
[04:13.440 --> 04:13.740]  There we go.
[04:14.120 --> 04:16.100]  I was connecting my controller.
[04:16.520 --> 04:17.180]  That's awesome.
[04:17.180 --> 04:18.300]  That's awesome, dude.
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.140]  Thank you for joining us, Andrew.
[04:20.640 --> 04:23.820]  We do not need this animosity on the ground floor.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.460]  Everybody, let's be cool.
[04:25.640 --> 04:27.080]  We're a supportive group.
[04:27.620 --> 04:28.560]  Why is there not a jump button?
[04:29.560 --> 04:29.920]  It's A.
[04:30.040 --> 04:30.680]  There's A.
[04:30.820 --> 04:32.220]  Oh, I'm hitting it.
[04:32.880 --> 04:35.680]  Oh, boys, this might be a WASD.
[04:36.880 --> 04:37.560]  Uh-oh.
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.060]  This ain't good.
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.280]  Were you guys using controllers the last times we played?
[04:41.500 --> 04:41.640]  Yeah.
[04:41.980 --> 04:43.140]  I've always used keyboard.
[04:43.540 --> 04:44.860]  I've always used WASD.
[04:44.860 --> 04:46.280]  I've used controller every time.
[04:46.280 --> 04:48.220]  Plug in this controller and see if it works.
[04:49.140 --> 04:49.760]  Uh-oh.
[04:49.800 --> 04:50.960]  Yeah, mine did that.
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.580]  Jump button not working for Eric.
[04:52.880 --> 04:54.180]  Going to WASD.
[04:55.060 --> 04:55.920]  Uh-oh.
[04:56.580 --> 04:57.960]  WASD not working for Eric.
[04:58.380 --> 04:59.080]  Uh-oh.
[05:01.920 --> 05:02.640]  There we go.
[05:02.760 --> 05:03.200]  I fixed it.
[05:03.260 --> 05:03.780]  Oh, my God.
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.340]  Let's go.
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.960]  Thank you so much for all the subs.
[05:08.340 --> 05:09.620]  What a fucking hero you are.
[05:10.440 --> 05:11.480]  Hey, thanks for being here, everybody.
[05:11.560 --> 05:12.180]  We appreciate it.
[05:12.200 --> 05:12.720]  Happy Friday.
[05:12.980 --> 05:14.100]  Happy Friday?
[05:14.840 --> 05:15.560]  Happy Friday.
[05:15.560 --> 05:16.920]  Happy Friday for Geoff, that's for sure.
[05:17.340 --> 05:20.460]  Was anyone able to catch the 50 turns we did the other day?
[05:20.840 --> 05:21.120]  What was that?
[05:21.140 --> 05:21.360]  Monday?
[05:21.760 --> 05:23.900]  Yeah, any of you guys with us on Monday?
[05:23.900 --> 05:24.660]  That was this week?
[05:25.020 --> 05:26.120]  Yeah, it's been a long week.
[05:26.180 --> 05:26.860]  I can't believe that was this week.
[05:27.140 --> 05:30.360]  Thank you so much, NerdyNagle, for all of the subs.
[05:31.540 --> 05:31.960]  Where you going, Nick?
[05:31.960 --> 05:32.540]  That'll be out.
[05:33.200 --> 05:33.800]  Nick pulled me on that.
[05:33.800 --> 05:34.540]  You going to get on the chain?
[05:35.780 --> 05:36.640]  I would love to.
[05:39.900 --> 05:41.720]  We'll be putting that out next Thursday.
[05:41.720 --> 05:44.560]  Cloudcore was there for the birthday boys' comeback.
[05:45.920 --> 05:46.860]  No spoilers.
[05:47.160 --> 05:48.440]  No spoilers, though.
[05:49.120 --> 05:54.500]  Manny Avocado, currently working on getting my license to become a property adjuster.
[05:54.720 --> 05:56.420]  Got any tips for studying for it?
[05:56.580 --> 05:56.680]  Yeah.
[05:57.420 --> 05:57.940]  What?
[05:58.220 --> 05:59.400]  Who are you asking?
[06:00.040 --> 06:01.980]  I would use Google and YouTube.
[06:02.520 --> 06:03.740]  Are you out of your mind?
[06:03.740 --> 06:05.520]  I would start with what is a property adjuster?
[06:05.760 --> 06:11.300]  Yeah, you're going to do that on Google, and then you're going to find out, and you're going to watch videos on YouTube.
[06:12.180 --> 06:15.180]  Gavin being at the front is not working for me, fellas.
[06:15.440 --> 06:16.760]  We got a group up in the front.
[06:17.180 --> 06:19.660]  I mean, it's just been Gavin at the back the whole time.
[06:19.740 --> 06:22.160]  I've only been at the front when I was dragging Andrew's ass.
[06:23.960 --> 06:27.140]  Hey, big love from Wales. Big love from America. Back to you, Reece.
[06:27.400 --> 06:28.820]  Five. Five. Five.
[06:29.020 --> 06:29.940]  Get him up. Get him up, Gavin.
[06:30.280 --> 06:30.900]  I did.
[06:32.480 --> 06:35.140]  I'm going to pull his fucking load over here. Jesus.
[06:36.420 --> 06:39.040]  This is the first channel he's ever subbed to.
[06:39.040 --> 06:41.140]  Wow. Thank you.
[06:41.660 --> 06:42.720]  Always remember your first.
[06:43.240 --> 06:44.960]  And you're welcome.
[06:45.060 --> 06:45.260]  Okay.
[06:46.840 --> 06:48.200]  That was Nick.
[06:48.620 --> 06:50.340]  That was 100% Nick.
[06:53.340 --> 06:55.020]  Nick was the first one.
[06:55.780 --> 06:56.740]  First draw.
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.700]  How do you use a checkpoint?
[06:59.260 --> 06:59.780]  Do we have any?
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.840]  We have to get there. We have to physically get there.
[07:01.860 --> 07:04.140]  I don't think you're anywhere close to a checkpoint.
[07:04.460 --> 07:08.340]  The first checkpoint, I think, was in the area where you guys swam that one time.
[07:09.040 --> 07:10.440]  That's the first one?
[07:10.780 --> 07:12.460]  I'm pretty sure that's the first checkpoint.
[07:12.460 --> 07:13.620]  We didn't even get to that last stream.
[07:14.280 --> 07:16.580]  That's why we're catching you at this stream.
[07:18.140 --> 07:22.440]  Hey, maybe I'm the weak link. Maybe now that I'm not playing with y'all, it'll be so easy.
[07:22.660 --> 07:23.720]  Hey, what just happened?
[07:24.180 --> 07:25.560]  That was the game.
[07:26.640 --> 07:27.320]  What's going on?
[07:28.260 --> 07:30.440]  We all just fell through the ladder.
[07:30.700 --> 07:31.780]  Come on, Gavin. Pull us up.
[07:32.260 --> 07:34.200]  What the fuck?
[07:34.320 --> 07:37.500]  I feel like whatever happened on our screen did not happen on Gavin's.
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.320]  Okay, that's...
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.520]  If only I had been impaled by the spikes.
[07:45.720 --> 07:46.240]  Thanks, Blamebleeps.
[07:46.600 --> 07:52.460]  Anyway, like I was saying, I feel like you guys are going to just fucking run through this.
[07:52.680 --> 07:56.280]  I feel good about it. If Gavin could take the lead, I'd feel really good about it.
[07:56.280 --> 07:57.320]  You lead, Gavin.
[07:57.320 --> 08:01.240]  I bet you guys, because you guys have your heist time together.
[08:01.340 --> 08:03.680]  You guys are a well-oiled machine. You know how to work together.
[08:04.120 --> 08:05.660]  You understand each other intuitively.
[08:05.920 --> 08:08.320]  I don't even know that we need to do that stupid wheel anymore.
[08:08.320 --> 08:10.680]  We might just recognize that this is the crew for this.
[08:10.680 --> 08:12.740]  No, we gotta do the wheel every time.
[08:12.920 --> 08:16.980]  I mean, you guys are building fucking cohesion and symmetry as you go.
[08:17.060 --> 08:19.460]  It would be weird for me to jump in at any point in the future.
[08:19.460 --> 08:20.960]  Yeah, but we don't want you to feel left out.
[08:21.200 --> 08:23.920]  I don't. I don't. And also, I'll be honest with you guys.
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.040]  I know you're saying it to be kind.
[08:25.320 --> 08:28.880]  I've been kind of left out my whole life. It's my thing. I'm used to it.
[08:28.960 --> 08:29.540]  It's where I'm comfortable.
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.380]  Well, Geoff, that's why this company's different. We're including you, buddy.
[08:33.440 --> 08:34.820]  No, I wanna be on the edges.
[08:35.760 --> 08:39.840]  You know how Gavin and Andrew play video games together in their private lives and never invite me?
[08:39.900 --> 08:40.740]  It's kind of like that.
[08:41.940 --> 08:43.080]  Andrew, you wanna pull them up?
[08:43.160 --> 08:43.740]  I'm trying.
[08:45.660 --> 08:48.920]  The back stopped moving and all of a sudden I didn't pull them. Sorry.
[08:49.740 --> 08:50.540]  No, we all moved.
[08:54.940 --> 08:55.260]  Dots?
[08:57.400 --> 08:58.200]  Let's do it.
[08:59.080 --> 08:59.980]  Go for it, Andrew.
[09:01.140 --> 09:03.360]  I'm in the air. I can't. I'm fanning right now.
[09:03.540 --> 09:04.540]  Alright, here we go, Nick.
[09:04.540 --> 09:05.740]  There you go.
[09:06.940 --> 09:08.100]  That's gonna be an issue.
[09:08.280 --> 09:10.340]  No, we're not going all the way down.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.060]  We're not doing that.
[09:13.080 --> 09:14.460]  Is there a sprint button?
[09:15.880 --> 09:17.160]  It's right trigger.
[09:17.580 --> 09:18.100]  Gotta go right.
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.140]  I don't know. Is Andrew talking to us or himself?
[09:22.640 --> 09:23.060]  Let's storm him.
[09:24.300 --> 09:29.160]  Stormrix in the chat, who I recognize from a lot of streams, said,
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.540]  I really appreciate laid-back Geoff commentary. This really is the best combination.
[09:33.540 --> 09:34.860]  I agree with that.
[09:34.900 --> 09:36.160]  I like it when it's not reading chat.
[09:36.860 --> 09:38.900]  It's nice when it's laid-back Geoff commentary.
[09:39.120 --> 09:42.860]  We should just stick with this configuration is what the audience is saying.
[09:44.940 --> 09:45.060]  Yeah.
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.340]  Let's group up.
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.900]  As soon as other people learn how to stream, Nick's gonna be reading chat.
[09:52.080 --> 09:52.940]  Okay, we're all good.
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.100]  You guys are doing great.
[09:54.720 --> 09:55.960]  We're doing great.
[09:58.260 --> 09:58.960]  We're about to do that.
[09:59.180 --> 10:01.320]  We're going insane mode, making jumps.
[10:01.760 --> 10:02.880]  Who's at the back of the chain?
[10:03.640 --> 10:04.280]  I am.
[10:05.900 --> 10:07.180]  That was not me.
[10:07.340 --> 10:08.220]  That was Aaron.
[10:08.360 --> 10:11.820]  I should lead and then other people just go in the middle of the chain.
[10:12.080 --> 10:12.860]  Why do you keep stopping?
[10:14.280 --> 10:15.920]  So everyone, are you ready to jump?
[10:15.960 --> 10:16.660]  There we go.
[10:17.240 --> 10:18.760]  You freaking mug, what do you mean?
[10:19.060 --> 10:20.180]  I'll lead over here.
[10:20.300 --> 10:22.720]  I think this is what we need. We need Nick.
[10:23.500 --> 10:24.160]  Alright, you go ahead.
[10:28.100 --> 10:35.700]  Well, Lupa Lazuli, even if we could do warp to the highest point we've been to, that kind of defeats what we're trying to do here.
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.740]  Starting from scratch.
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.960]  Warp to the toppest is the way to go.
[10:39.200 --> 10:39.600]  Yeah.
[10:44.130 --> 10:44.910]  There we go.
[10:46.130 --> 10:46.530]  Teamwork.
[10:47.530 --> 10:48.610]  That was progress.
[10:50.790 --> 10:51.810]  Let's see some progress.
[10:52.430 --> 10:54.270]  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang.
[10:54.690 --> 10:55.570]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11:03.810 --> 11:05.010]  Three, two, one.
[11:06.250 --> 11:07.070]  Three, two, one.
[11:08.370 --> 11:09.150]  Three, two, one.
[11:09.490 --> 11:09.630]  Three, two, one.
[11:09.630 --> 11:10.870]  Okay, remember, jump.
[11:12.370 --> 11:14.110]  Oh, you guys are going to nail this.
[11:14.230 --> 11:14.770]  Oh, balls.
[11:15.050 --> 11:15.890]  We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
[11:15.910 --> 11:17.230]  You're fine, you're fine.
[11:19.770 --> 11:21.470]  Reach the ledge!
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.630]  Doesn't really matter.
[11:24.030 --> 11:24.350]  Okay.
[11:25.270 --> 11:27.090]  I got a lot of air on that.
[11:27.850 --> 11:28.590]  Alright, thank you.
[11:28.950 --> 11:30.350]  Need a bidet recommendation.
[11:30.890 --> 11:31.210]  Tushy.
[11:32.250 --> 11:34.690]  Or, I had a Toto. I don't need more, but I did.
[11:35.190 --> 11:36.510]  Now I just have a raw asshole.
[11:37.250 --> 11:38.390]  Alright, there's Andrew in the front.
[11:38.690 --> 11:40.130]  He's in the middle, so he's going to go first.
[11:41.750 --> 11:43.070]  Yeah, no, this should go well.
[11:43.250 --> 11:44.870]  Just get in the middle, and then he's going to go first.
[11:45.250 --> 11:45.630]  I'm waiting.
[11:49.310 --> 11:50.790]  As long as we're together, it's fine.
[11:50.850 --> 11:51.470]  Doesn't really matter.
[11:52.970 --> 11:53.210]  Okay.
[11:53.210 --> 11:55.230]  Are you my family at Christmas?
[11:58.050 --> 11:58.410]  Yes.
[11:59.210 --> 11:59.570]  Okay.
[12:01.250 --> 12:03.210]  There's a little bit of a divide between...
[12:03.890 --> 12:04.690]  Alright, we'll catch up.
[12:05.690 --> 12:06.630]  I'm just letting you know.
[12:06.830 --> 12:09.030]  I'm just vocalizing it, because I know you can't see.
[12:09.410 --> 12:10.810]  You didn't catch that. That was catch up.
[12:15.010 --> 12:16.750]  How are we looking so far to you, Geoff?
[12:17.170 --> 12:18.270]  You guys are looking great.
[12:18.410 --> 12:21.350]  I don't want you guys to focus on what's below you, because I don't want you to...
[12:21.350 --> 12:22.330]  I don't know if you're scared of heights,
[12:22.450 --> 12:26.250]  but I see everything you've accomplished immediately below you,
[12:26.330 --> 12:27.210]  and it looks like a lot.
[12:27.310 --> 12:29.790]  It makes me feel proud,
[12:30.030 --> 12:33.130]  and also excited about the future.
[12:34.190 --> 12:34.670]  Sweet.
[12:35.410 --> 12:38.110]  I'll be happy when we can't see where we started below us.
[12:39.210 --> 12:43.890]  Well, that's certainly something to look forward to.
[12:44.650 --> 12:44.990]  Alright.
[12:45.510 --> 12:46.630]  You didn't call it.
[12:47.130 --> 12:47.950]  Alright, next one.
[12:47.950 --> 12:47.990]  Next one.
[12:53.010 --> 12:54.130]  Someone's calling me.
[12:54.210 --> 12:55.710]  Who just mantled?
[12:56.630 --> 12:57.350]  That was me.
[12:57.430 --> 12:58.630]  You said next one. Nobody went.
[12:59.670 --> 12:59.890]  What?
[13:01.070 --> 13:01.930]  I went.
[13:03.270 --> 13:04.670]  I went to the next one.
[13:04.810 --> 13:05.690]  You guys were slow.
[13:08.630 --> 13:10.150]  I'm trying to speedrun this thing.
[13:10.230 --> 13:11.190]  You guys are taking your time.
[13:12.050 --> 13:12.230]  What?
[13:14.470 --> 13:15.350]  Next one.
[13:15.490 --> 13:17.430]  Instead of thinking of the next one,
[13:17.430 --> 13:17.950]  you thought,
[13:18.490 --> 13:19.690]  let's go.
[13:20.970 --> 13:22.470]  Hype train, level 12.
[13:22.590 --> 13:23.670]  Thank you so much.
[13:24.650 --> 13:25.930]  That's pretty fucking cool.
[13:26.090 --> 13:28.090]  We had a level 21 hype train
[13:28.090 --> 13:29.830]  on Andrew's birthday party.
[13:29.930 --> 13:30.570]  That was awesome.
[13:31.570 --> 13:32.170]  Stop.
[13:34.110 --> 13:34.710]  Go.
[13:36.650 --> 13:37.250]  Easy.
[13:38.050 --> 13:39.330]  Nice job, fellas.
[13:39.610 --> 13:41.390]  We're communicating really well.
[13:41.530 --> 13:42.390]  I'm really proud of you guys.
[13:42.390 --> 13:43.170]  This is fantastic.
[13:46.700 --> 13:48.580]  Taking the lead on this ladder.
[13:49.080 --> 13:50.320]  You jumped on my back.
[13:50.660 --> 13:52.220]  I did, yeah. I wanted to pick you back up.
[13:52.920 --> 13:54.220]  You guys are absolutely
[13:54.220 --> 13:56.000]  killing it. I'm telling you.
[13:56.480 --> 13:58.820]  You can see the GTA work.
[13:59.800 --> 14:00.520]  We're doing this pendulum
[14:00.520 --> 14:01.200]  without Geoff.
[14:01.860 --> 14:04.740]  We only fell off this pendulum one time,
[14:05.140 --> 14:05.780]  by the way.
[14:07.440 --> 14:07.860]  Wow.
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.740]  Everyone made it.
[14:11.300 --> 14:11.800]  Okay.
[14:11.800 --> 14:11.980]  Okay.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.280]  Okay.
[14:15.580 --> 14:16.380]  Wait.
[14:17.800 --> 14:18.760]  It's okay.
[14:19.220 --> 14:19.980]  Pull up, Eric.
[14:20.420 --> 14:21.060]  Okay.
[14:23.780 --> 14:25.000]  We're synced again.
[14:25.920 --> 14:26.740]  Good job.
[14:27.420 --> 14:29.080]  Wait for Eric.
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.580]  Wait, Eric wasn't
[14:31.580 --> 14:32.240]  all the way up.
[14:32.840 --> 14:34.600]  I know.
[14:36.140 --> 14:36.780]  The slack was there.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.640]  We're fine.
[14:37.640 --> 14:38.700]  We're good.
[14:38.880 --> 14:39.660]  Slack was good.
[14:40.980 --> 14:43.300]  You don't have to go left and right. You can just jump.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.120]  Killed it.
[14:46.460 --> 14:47.100]  Nailed it.
[14:47.140 --> 14:48.720]  Up we go.
[14:48.820 --> 14:49.680]  We're flying.
[14:51.380 --> 14:52.680]  Now we got barrels.
[14:54.420 --> 14:55.480]  Didn't even call it out.
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.240]  Just went for it.
[14:57.420 --> 14:59.580]  I could feel it happening.
[14:59.740 --> 15:00.460]  I'm not feeling it.
[15:01.200 --> 15:01.820]  Here's the ladder.
[15:02.940 --> 15:04.460]  I'm not even playing it.
[15:04.460 --> 15:06.720]  I think the whole audience is feeling it.
[15:06.860 --> 15:07.000]  Shortcut.
[15:07.500 --> 15:08.920]  Something special is happening.
[15:11.500 --> 15:12.760]  Andrew's inventing
[15:12.760 --> 15:14.180]  new tactics right in front of us.
[15:14.320 --> 15:14.940]  This is amazing.
[15:17.520 --> 15:18.880]  Remember it's
[15:18.880 --> 15:19.480]  this one.
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.020]  Who's going to...
[15:21.780 --> 15:22.460]  Go.
[15:24.620 --> 15:25.300]  Jump.
[15:26.380 --> 15:27.060]  Easy.
[15:27.560 --> 15:28.960]  Remember this one.
[15:29.460 --> 15:31.680]  I don't remember. Hang on.
[15:31.680 --> 15:32.840]  Why did everyone stop?
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.460]  I don't know what we're doing.
[15:34.660 --> 15:36.960]  I don't remember this one.
[15:37.420 --> 15:39.460]  We're going to land on the platform and wait.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.100]  Then we're all going to jump on the trampoline.
[15:42.120 --> 15:43.040]  Somebody call it.
[15:44.460 --> 15:46.060]  3, 2, 1.
[15:46.160 --> 15:46.500]  Jump.
[15:47.600 --> 15:49.620]  Someone asked if I got any more than drafts.
[15:49.640 --> 15:51.060]  We filmed a draft today actually.
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.200]  3, 2, 1. Jump.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.920]  Everything we filmed today went really well.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.160]  We filmed three things today already.
[15:57.060 --> 15:57.880]  All supplementals.
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.000]  No video games.
[15:59.000 --> 15:59.980]  Who's jumping and grabbing?
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.320]  Apparently Gavin.
[16:03.260 --> 16:04.520]  I can get it.
[16:05.120 --> 16:05.760]  Here we go.
[16:09.720 --> 16:11.080]  Hold on it, Gavin.
[16:11.420 --> 16:13.640]  This is what all those hours in the gym
[16:13.640 --> 16:14.840]  was all about, Gavin.
[16:16.100 --> 16:17.860]  You've trained for this moment.
[16:18.000 --> 16:19.060]  Do not let go.
[16:20.000 --> 16:21.920]  Check to see if he has abs.
[16:22.380 --> 16:23.820]  Check to see if that's the real Gavin.
[16:25.820 --> 16:27.940]  Abs by August. He's got it.
[16:33.040 --> 16:33.660]  Hey, Nick.
[16:33.760 --> 16:35.200]  Double check if you're driving or not.
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.860]  I definitely won't
[16:37.860 --> 16:39.140]  make that mistake again.
[16:39.200 --> 16:39.780]  All the way up.
[16:40.020 --> 16:44.020]  You guys are looking good.
[16:44.560 --> 16:44.920]  Okay.
[16:45.380 --> 16:46.200]  I'm on the back.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.660]  Nick, are you driving?
[16:48.260 --> 16:49.620]  Are you sure?
[16:49.620 --> 16:51.240]  It's very clearly Gavin.
[16:52.020 --> 16:53.360]  I'm not touching the controls.
[16:54.580 --> 16:56.160]  What are you doing?
[16:56.820 --> 16:57.520]  Jesus Christ.
[16:57.960 --> 16:59.280]  It got real lurchy.
[16:59.340 --> 17:00.000]  Did you see that?
[17:00.640 --> 17:02.380]  We saw you.
[17:07.660 --> 17:09.000]  It's different on his screen.
[17:09.100 --> 17:10.680]  We have to remember it's different on his screen.
[17:11.020 --> 17:12.500]  I didn't hit shit on mine.
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.660]  What are you doing?
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.280]  We're going off the edge.
[17:17.280 --> 17:17.900]  You're in the hole.
[17:19.460 --> 17:21.500]  I'm getting real nervous.
[17:21.700 --> 17:22.880]  I've done this before.
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.040]  I don't know what's wrong with you.
[17:25.580 --> 17:26.460]  It's different.
[17:27.300 --> 17:29.280]  That time he definitely hit something.
[17:31.460 --> 17:34.320]  That time he absolutely did.
[17:35.200 --> 17:37.280]  What is wrong with you?
[17:37.280 --> 17:38.800]  It's twitchier than last time.
[17:39.260 --> 17:41.560]  Maybe it's because it's easier.
[17:42.040 --> 17:43.000]  You're playing on easy.
[17:43.980 --> 17:45.440]  They have to up the difficulty.
[17:45.760 --> 17:46.420]  It's the last one.
[17:49.540 --> 17:50.580]  Different on his screen.
[17:50.900 --> 17:52.940]  Every time on the screen.
[17:53.500 --> 17:54.600]  Oh yeah.
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.720]  We have Super Mario.
[17:56.960 --> 17:57.600]  Let's get on.
[17:58.340 --> 17:59.160]  Let's do it.
[18:01.280 --> 18:01.760]  Easy.
[18:02.200 --> 18:03.340]  This is baby stuff right here.
[18:03.520 --> 18:05.220]  It sure is.
[18:06.420 --> 18:09.280]  As Eric says, it goes one further than you think it will.
[18:09.560 --> 18:10.560]  Just stay calm.
[18:10.560 --> 18:11.220]  Yep.
[18:12.200 --> 18:13.040]  It's going to be right here.
[18:13.720 --> 18:14.240]  Nope.
[18:16.240 --> 18:17.320]  Just don't listen at all.
[18:17.760 --> 18:19.640]  We went. It was time.
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.200]  I went because someone said no.
[18:22.300 --> 18:22.660]  Let's go.
[18:23.120 --> 18:24.660]  And we went and it was great.
[18:25.420 --> 18:26.940]  It worked. That's all that matters.
[18:27.360 --> 18:28.960]  This is Gavin's favorite.
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.820]  If you jump from this sticky outcropping...
[18:33.820 --> 18:33.860]  Shit.
[18:35.780 --> 18:37.120]  Gavin just fell off.
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.240]  I got no slack.
[18:38.560 --> 18:40.000]  I got no slack.
[18:41.180 --> 18:42.300]  What's going on?
[18:42.740 --> 18:45.260]  Just climb up on the thing.
[18:45.400 --> 18:47.620]  I was hanging off the side so I couldn't pull him up.
[18:48.060 --> 18:48.840]  Gavin didn't wait.
[18:48.960 --> 18:49.420]  He just went.
[18:50.480 --> 18:51.020]  No.
[18:55.180 --> 18:56.760]  Thanks for asking though.
[18:57.620 --> 18:58.400]  Gavin jumped down.
[18:59.900 --> 19:01.840]  What are you doing?
[19:02.520 --> 19:04.780]  My camera got a little bit stuck under the one above us.
[19:04.840 --> 19:05.620]  So I got lost.
[19:07.100 --> 19:07.500]  Alright.
[19:07.580 --> 19:09.220]  We got to jump on...
[19:09.220 --> 19:10.960]  I guess this thing.
[19:11.520 --> 19:12.800]  Yeah, we can just jump over there.
[19:13.740 --> 19:13.960]  Alright.
[19:15.760 --> 19:16.160]  Alright.
[19:17.140 --> 19:17.940]  This is not safe.
[19:19.740 --> 19:20.540]  Everyone just...
[19:21.040 --> 19:21.440]  Wow.
[19:23.120 --> 19:25.280]  This is where we got to sync up.
[19:25.520 --> 19:26.160]  Or a stop and go.
[19:27.720 --> 19:28.520]  Hang on.
[19:28.800 --> 19:31.980]  I know that's what we're asking right now.
[19:32.020 --> 19:32.940]  I want to make sure we have a consensus.
[19:32.940 --> 19:34.600]  We land and just keep going?
[19:34.760 --> 19:35.420]  Or are we landing and stopping?
[19:36.020 --> 19:38.380]  Let's stop because if we try to keep going
[19:38.380 --> 19:40.260]  and someone misses, we're fucked.
[19:40.280 --> 19:41.720]  So just land and stop.
[19:42.160 --> 19:43.280]  Alright, Gavin, you want to lead?
[19:44.420 --> 19:46.420]  3, 2, 1, I go.
[19:46.840 --> 19:49.140]  Guys, the audience said that the team
[19:49.140 --> 19:51.040]  is falling apart in front of their eyes.
[19:51.160 --> 19:51.820]  Please prove them wrong.
[19:51.820 --> 19:54.100]  I don't give a fuck about the chat right now.
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.040]  Shut up.
[19:55.240 --> 19:57.000]  Shut the fuck up.
[19:57.260 --> 20:01.040]  You guys can do it.
[20:01.660 --> 20:02.780]  Pull Erica.
[20:03.020 --> 20:03.420]  Pull him up.
[20:04.380 --> 20:07.420]  You have to look at him to pull him.
[20:07.960 --> 20:08.100]  Pulling.
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.140]  Pull him up.
[20:13.820 --> 20:14.940]  Andrew, you've
[20:14.940 --> 20:16.200]  proven the audience right.
[20:16.360 --> 20:17.180]  I didn't see that coming.
[20:18.360 --> 20:20.500]  It's okay. We recovered.
[20:21.860 --> 20:22.800]  We did not recover.
[20:23.100 --> 20:23.520]  We recovered.
[20:23.920 --> 20:25.560]  I would welcome that recovery.
[20:27.360 --> 20:29.340]  Next time I just have to mute Geoff
[20:29.340 --> 20:29.800]  and we're fine.
[20:30.500 --> 20:32.160]  If you guys want, I can leave.
[20:32.780 --> 20:35.100]  I'll fly it out.
[20:35.260 --> 20:36.440]  If you guys don't want me talking,
[20:37.940 --> 20:39.360]  I'll see you guys later.
[20:40.040 --> 20:41.020]  Take it easy, man. See you later.
[20:42.100 --> 20:42.380]  That was
[20:43.440 --> 20:43.940]  on me.
[20:44.220 --> 20:46.420]  I thought I could make the jump.
[20:48.100 --> 20:48.680]  Pulling him up.
[20:49.280 --> 20:50.620]  Why did you think you could make the jump
[20:50.620 --> 20:52.300]  when two people were hanging?
[20:52.680 --> 20:53.940]  Because I made it last time.
[20:55.400 --> 20:57.340]  I thought I'd have more floor space
[20:57.340 --> 20:57.820]  to pull.
[20:59.740 --> 21:00.260]  Listen.
[21:00.660 --> 21:02.520]  Okay, I understand.
[21:02.980 --> 21:03.480]  That was on me.
[21:05.140 --> 21:07.560]  We also stopped doing the countdown.
[21:07.880 --> 21:08.880]  We just continued.
[21:09.400 --> 21:10.260]  I couldn't hear anyone.
[21:10.620 --> 21:12.800]  I apologize. I couldn't hear anyone.
[21:14.280 --> 21:15.440]  I mean, nobody
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.080]  said anything.
[21:16.680 --> 21:18.580]  It just ceased and then someone went.
[21:18.680 --> 21:20.500]  I kept making a mistake of saying
[21:22.300 --> 21:23.220]  whatever I said.
[21:23.340 --> 21:23.860]  It doesn't even matter.
[21:24.320 --> 21:24.680]  What?
[21:25.680 --> 21:27.520]  I was saying something to indicate that
[21:27.520 --> 21:29.840]  I had made it, but it implied that
[21:29.840 --> 21:30.660]  we should move.
[21:31.820 --> 21:32.720]  Wait, what did you say?
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.580]  I don't remember what I said. I said something that was
[21:35.580 --> 21:36.520]  like go or whatever.
[21:38.420 --> 21:39.720]  Hold here for just a second.
[21:39.860 --> 21:40.740]  Hold here for just a second. Sorry.
[21:41.240 --> 21:43.860]  Give me just a second to...
[21:44.480 --> 21:45.360]  You gonna make it cool?
[21:45.860 --> 21:47.940]  No, I gotta stop my stream there.
[21:48.240 --> 21:49.680]  So, I'm not using all these
[21:49.680 --> 21:51.280]  fucking resources. Alright, cool. I'm ready.
[21:53.280 --> 21:53.960]  Okay.
[21:54.120 --> 21:54.580]  Okay.
[21:56.400 --> 21:57.360]  Sync up.
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.200]  Yup.
[21:58.800 --> 21:59.060]  Go.
[22:01.020 --> 22:02.960]  Easy, easy, easy.
[22:03.500 --> 22:04.180]  Okay.
[22:06.840 --> 22:07.920]  Somebody calling it?
[22:08.100 --> 22:10.120]  3, 2, 1, go.
[22:10.520 --> 22:10.980]  Thank you.
[22:11.880 --> 22:14.260]  3, 2, 1, go.
[22:14.320 --> 22:15.000]  Good job, Nick.
[22:15.600 --> 22:16.140]  Thank you!
[22:18.720 --> 22:19.040]  Thank you!
[22:19.040 --> 22:19.960]  Ooh, who wants to grab it?
[22:20.600 --> 22:20.920]  Gavin.
[22:22.600 --> 22:24.180]  I'm the middle. That way we don't
[22:24.180 --> 22:25.140]  have to hang all the way down to the bottom.
[22:25.720 --> 22:26.440]  Oh, that's a fair point.
[22:28.100 --> 22:28.740]  Dangling chain.
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.820]  I don't know if my Discord sounds.
[22:34.900 --> 22:36.600]  Did Geoff leave? Yeah, he did.
[22:38.420 --> 22:39.420]  I'm spinning, Nick.
[22:41.100 --> 22:41.940]  You sure are.
[22:44.020 --> 22:44.660]  You are
[22:44.660 --> 22:45.060]  spinning.
[22:46.880 --> 22:47.340]  Wee.
[22:47.680 --> 22:48.600]  I've got a top going.
[22:50.860 --> 22:52.380]  Let me know when you guys are all
[22:54.220 --> 22:55.140]  over ground
[22:55.140 --> 22:55.800]  and I'll let go.
[22:58.120 --> 22:58.460]  Alright.
[22:59.500 --> 23:00.080]  We're good.
[23:01.820 --> 23:03.480]  Geoff called your bluff, Eric.
[23:03.780 --> 23:04.540]  Oh, no.
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.960]  Oh, boy. Okay, here we go.
[23:06.980 --> 23:08.620]  It's not me. I'm not driving.
[23:09.180 --> 23:09.980]  It's you driving?
[23:10.740 --> 23:11.660]  It's Gavin again.
[23:13.560 --> 23:14.080]  Uh...
[23:14.080 --> 23:15.340]  Never again.
[23:17.340 --> 23:17.640]  You're good.
[23:24.180 --> 23:25.820]  It's different on his
[23:25.820 --> 23:27.780]  screen. You know, it's only a
[23:27.780 --> 23:29.660]  problem when he stops. If the car
[23:29.660 --> 23:31.800]  stops, you know that's when we're in
[23:31.800 --> 23:32.060]  trouble.
[23:33.060 --> 23:35.780]  Hey, I recently discovered in Mario
[23:35.780 --> 23:37.360]  Kart that I had this...
[23:37.360 --> 23:39.720]  Are you kidding me? Is this for real?
[23:39.720 --> 23:41.220]  What did you do?
[23:41.380 --> 23:42.640]  We can't get out!
[23:42.820 --> 23:44.300]  Hit a button!
[23:46.300 --> 23:46.540]  Gavin.
[23:47.440 --> 23:48.960]  What did you do, Gavin?
[23:49.320 --> 23:51.340]  What did you do?
[23:51.700 --> 23:52.980]  How did you do that?
[23:53.240 --> 23:55.120]  How the fuck did you do that?
[23:55.180 --> 23:55.740]  That's okay.
[23:57.260 --> 23:59.940]  Yeah, we're fine. We didn't go all the way to the bottom.
[24:00.440 --> 24:01.140]  What happened?
[24:01.180 --> 24:02.240]  We just lost a little bit of progress.
[24:03.440 --> 24:03.720]  It's all good.
[24:04.080 --> 24:05.000]  Gavin!
[24:08.140 --> 24:10.380]  I just discovered in Mario
[24:10.380 --> 24:12.200]  Kart that I accidentally
[24:12.200 --> 24:14.140]  had the bumpers
[24:14.140 --> 24:16.220]  thing turned on, and I thought I was a great
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.160]  driver. It just turns out that the game wasn't
[24:18.160 --> 24:19.620]  letting me crash into the wall.
[24:22.780 --> 24:24.500]  What's going on?
[24:24.600 --> 24:25.060]  Oh, boy.
[24:25.300 --> 24:27.240]  I don't know.
[24:27.720 --> 24:30.100]  There's no checkpoint! We didn't reach a
[24:30.100 --> 24:31.900]  checkpoint! There's no
[24:31.900 --> 24:32.460]  checkpoint!
[24:33.820 --> 24:34.380]  Load checkpoint.
[24:34.880 --> 24:36.400]  What happened?
[24:38.200 --> 24:39.980]  What the fuck is going
[24:39.980 --> 24:40.500]  on?
[24:41.080 --> 24:42.000]  I'm thrown.
[24:42.380 --> 24:44.640]  Why are you thrown?
[24:45.240 --> 24:46.460]  We went all the way back.
[24:47.020 --> 24:47.820]  What happened?
[24:48.900 --> 24:50.220]  I hate this game.
[24:50.820 --> 24:53.460]  I keep not
[24:53.460 --> 24:55.420]  getting an answer. What is
[24:55.420 --> 24:57.220]  going on? What occurred?
[24:58.520 --> 24:59.120]  I don't know.
[24:59.120 --> 25:01.100]  We were too high, I guess, on the ladder.
[25:01.320 --> 25:03.500]  I don't know. I'm not sure who got clipped by that one.
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.260]  That sounds like you.
[25:05.380 --> 25:06.200]  But we're back down.
[25:07.500 --> 25:09.080]  That way you said that makes me think
[25:09.080 --> 25:11.080]  it might be you. No, I just genuinely don't know. We're all
[25:11.080 --> 25:13.080]  kind of grouped up. I didn't see you. I want to know what happened
[25:13.080 --> 25:13.700]  to the car.
[25:15.100 --> 25:16.640]  Yeah, what happened to the car, Gavin? It got hit.
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.100]  Listen, we... the guy
[25:19.100 --> 25:21.020]  that doesn't drive at all, we put behind
[25:21.020 --> 25:22.540]  the wheel twice. I think that's our fault.
[25:24.260 --> 25:25.140]  At a certain point,
[25:25.180 --> 25:26.840]  we have to look in the mirror and say, hey, that was
[25:26.840 --> 25:27.640]  on us. That was on us.
[25:28.120 --> 25:30.840]  That's not on us! Absolutely
[25:30.840 --> 25:32.640]  not on us. I just need my
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.700]  Geoff, but I lost him.
[25:34.060 --> 25:37.080]  I lost
[25:37.080 --> 25:38.800]  my ability to drive.
[25:39.520 --> 25:40.720]  I don't... I just
[25:40.720 --> 25:42.760]  don't know what happened.
[25:42.780 --> 25:44.200]  Well, he does own your car.
[25:45.080 --> 25:47.060]  He does. I can't drive without him.
[25:47.640 --> 25:48.480]  Alright, we need an anchor
[25:48.480 --> 25:50.520]  beam in this world. And that's Geoff.
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.020]  Walking on this chain.
[25:54.680 --> 25:55.700]  This is good.
[25:56.160 --> 25:57.960]  We're a little far in the back.
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.020]  I could slide out.
[26:00.460 --> 26:02.500]  No, you can't. Please don't.
[26:03.180 --> 26:04.040]  Yep, we're still
[26:05.340 --> 26:06.400]  good on slack.
[26:11.080 --> 26:11.960]  Good job.
[26:15.020 --> 26:16.660]  Gavin, what's happening?
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.820]  I'm freaking out, man. I'm freaking out.
[26:18.880 --> 26:19.900]  I want to be in front of the chain.
[26:20.060 --> 26:21.380]  You deliberately...
[26:21.380 --> 26:23.220]  Deliberately, before we did this one,
[26:23.340 --> 26:25.280]  you said specifically you wanted
[26:25.280 --> 26:27.420]  to be at the end. You wanted to be at the front of the chain.
[26:27.620 --> 26:29.420]  No, I think you'll find what I said is I hate
[26:29.420 --> 26:30.620]  being in the middle of the chain.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.920]  Turns out, I hate the front as well.
[26:33.980 --> 26:35.260]  I have no preference
[26:35.260 --> 26:35.920]  to this shit.
[26:37.620 --> 26:38.520]  Okay, good job.
[26:43.200 --> 26:45.520]  I'm at the point now where I'm freaking out about walking.
[26:46.020 --> 26:46.940]  I don't understand.
[26:47.440 --> 26:48.480]  Everything was fine.
[26:53.500 --> 26:53.860]  I...
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.960]  I'm just tired.
[26:58.520 --> 26:59.380]  Real tired.
[27:01.380 --> 27:01.820]  Okay.
[27:02.920 --> 27:07.200]  Okay, here we go.
[27:07.740 --> 27:09.760]  There we go. Now we're locked in.
[27:09.900 --> 27:11.700]  Look at this. This is what we need more of.
[27:11.840 --> 27:13.480]  This is the move right here.
[27:14.260 --> 27:15.660]  Locked in, simple stuff,
[27:15.840 --> 27:17.840]  crushing it. That's the good shit.
[27:18.060 --> 27:19.340]  We fell so far.
[27:19.780 --> 27:22.080]  I agree. I agree with that.
[27:22.080 --> 27:23.900]  Halfway to where we've been.
[27:24.900 --> 27:26.160]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[27:26.160 --> 27:27.900]  I feel like we were close to the checkpoint.
[27:28.940 --> 27:29.520]  Were we?
[27:30.000 --> 27:30.640]  I think so.
[27:30.940 --> 27:33.940]  We were pretty close to the water
[27:33.940 --> 27:34.360]  and hole.
[27:35.260 --> 27:36.160]  The wet hole.
[27:38.580 --> 27:40.120]  My favorite thing to do in the
[27:40.120 --> 27:41.120]  summer is go to the wet hole.
[27:43.420 --> 27:45.820]  That reminds me of one time we played
[27:45.820 --> 27:47.560]  Family Feud in Achievement Hunter.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.980]  And I felt like I had
[27:49.980 --> 27:51.460]  the best answer in the world.
[27:51.540 --> 27:53.720]  I was really proud of it. I was like, it's definitely going to be number one.
[27:53.920 --> 27:54.700]  It wasn't even on the board.
[27:55.580 --> 27:56.640]  Speaking of wet holes,
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.780]  name something that's easier to get out of
[27:59.780 --> 28:01.720]  or easier to get into than out of.
[28:02.920 --> 28:03.120]  And I
[28:03.560 --> 28:04.520]  said a well.
[28:06.620 --> 28:07.820]  That's a great answer.
[28:08.300 --> 28:10.080]  A well is a good answer
[28:10.600 --> 28:11.900]  if you think about it.
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.940]  It's not one that I would expect to see
[28:13.940 --> 28:15.600]  on the board, but it's a good answer.
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.440]  Turns out they were talking about stuff like
[28:17.440 --> 28:17.900]  debt.
[28:18.300 --> 28:20.680]  Oh, I see.
[28:20.860 --> 28:23.300]  But you never hear people worrying about
[28:23.300 --> 28:24.300]  Timmy getting out of the well.
[28:24.480 --> 28:26.640]  Never hear about Timmy getting out of debt.
[28:28.600 --> 28:29.480]  What's that, girl?
[28:29.920 --> 28:31.080]  Timmy's in debt?
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.940]  What's that? Creditors, you say?
[28:39.020 --> 28:39.960]  Oh, shit.
[28:40.380 --> 28:41.760]  Someone just jumped immediately.
[28:42.040 --> 28:43.200]  What's going on?
[28:43.340 --> 28:44.240]  We're not going.
[28:44.240 --> 28:44.780]  We're not going.
[28:44.900 --> 28:46.400]  Go, go, go.
[28:47.820 --> 28:48.780]  What happened?
[28:49.700 --> 28:52.240]  I jumped on it, but I stood in the spot.
[28:52.540 --> 28:53.020]  Alright.
[28:54.520 --> 28:56.340]  Don't forget the run button, Andrew.
[28:56.700 --> 28:57.860]  Listen, we get slack.
[28:58.180 --> 28:58.520]  We're all good.
[29:02.100 --> 29:04.300]  Alright, do you think we can beat
[29:04.300 --> 29:05.000]  this next part?
[29:05.920 --> 29:06.840]  Yes, I do.
[29:07.460 --> 29:08.320]  What is it again?
[29:09.160 --> 29:10.020]  It's the ladder.
[29:11.160 --> 29:11.900]  Oh, God.
[29:12.060 --> 29:14.300]  I know that seems a bit
[29:14.300 --> 29:16.280]  obvious since we're on a ladder, but it is another ladder.
[29:16.460 --> 29:17.080]  It is, yeah.
[29:18.060 --> 29:19.060]  It's the mean ladder.
[29:19.860 --> 29:21.660]  Yeah, spiky ladder.
[29:22.120 --> 29:22.760]  Stay low.
[29:24.080 --> 29:25.060]  Everyone get here.
[29:25.980 --> 29:27.040]  We're here. Wait for the next one.
[29:30.100 --> 29:30.900]  Great job.
[29:31.420 --> 29:32.760]  Let's get close to the next one.
[29:33.040 --> 29:34.660]  Down a little, Gavin.
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.320]  You best be right up.
[29:38.320 --> 29:39.000]  You're okay.
[29:39.100 --> 29:40.820]  We did it.
[29:40.920 --> 29:44.300]  I felt like I needed to go up a little.
[29:44.680 --> 29:45.540]  No, you're fine.
[29:54.440 --> 29:57.140]  Now, the pendulum has been the most successful bit of the night.
[29:58.620 --> 29:59.720]  We did nail it.
[30:01.100 --> 30:06.460]  Oh, balance.
[30:06.920 --> 30:08.200]  Andrew, we gotta go.
[30:08.200 --> 30:08.920]  We gotta go.
[30:09.780 --> 30:11.520]  Okay, we gotta...
[30:13.080 --> 30:13.760]  Oh, balls.
[30:14.760 --> 30:15.980]  So, out of curiosity,
[30:16.680 --> 30:17.840]  when I said we gotta go,
[30:17.900 --> 30:18.960]  why did you go backwards?
[30:19.860 --> 30:22.220]  Because I tried to go forward and I didn't have the slack
[30:22.220 --> 30:23.700]  to do it, so then we synced up.
[30:23.740 --> 30:25.760]  So you went backwards.
[30:26.100 --> 30:28.500]  I did. I adapted to the
[30:28.500 --> 30:29.020]  environment.
[30:29.680 --> 30:31.020]  And how's that going?
[30:31.460 --> 30:32.980]  We're not all the way at the bottom.
[30:34.120 --> 30:36.200]  I think a lot of focus is...
[30:36.760 --> 30:38.620]  Are we out of sight of the environment?
[30:39.640 --> 30:39.980]  Maybe.
[30:40.580 --> 30:42.400]  And we're good vibes here.
[30:42.480 --> 30:43.640]  We're gonna get through this as a team.
[30:43.900 --> 30:46.220]  Why are you in the front?
[30:46.560 --> 30:48.380]  You're putting a lot of focus on the guy
[30:48.380 --> 30:49.260]  that made the jump.
[30:50.800 --> 30:52.340]  I made the jump with you.
[30:53.020 --> 30:55.100]  I didn't drag us down to the bottom.
[30:55.540 --> 30:56.360]  I'm saying that
[30:56.360 --> 30:58.280]  you're putting a lot of focus on one of the
[30:58.280 --> 30:59.740]  other two people who made the jump.
[31:01.380 --> 31:02.400]  Well, I feel
[31:02.400 --> 31:04.340]  the focus should not be on the other
[31:04.340 --> 31:05.700]  person who made the jump.
[31:05.740 --> 31:08.400]  To be fair, I went into an immediate
[31:08.400 --> 31:10.200]  grapple. I didn't overshoot entirely.
[31:11.000 --> 31:11.800]  Fair enough.
[31:11.860 --> 31:14.320]  I also was holding on because Gavin called it
[31:14.320 --> 31:15.420]  as the thing was in our face.
[31:15.420 --> 31:17.640]  It was a jump of the gun.
[31:18.200 --> 31:18.740]  That's okay.
[31:18.960 --> 31:20.840]  We waited like two for that one, didn't we?
[31:21.900 --> 31:22.820]  We're gonna sync back up here.
[31:23.840 --> 31:24.200]  You ready?
[31:25.680 --> 31:26.960]  We fly in.
[31:27.580 --> 31:28.380]  Alright, the next one.
[31:32.770 --> 31:33.250]  Easy.
[31:33.250 --> 31:33.370]  Easy.
[31:34.590 --> 31:36.630]  I look like Lois
[31:37.070 --> 31:38.090]  from Family Guy.
[31:39.590 --> 31:40.950]  That's what my character looks like.
[31:44.920 --> 31:46.600]  We just gotta stay
[31:46.600 --> 31:47.080]  as a unit.
[31:47.900 --> 31:49.140]  I'm gonna remember to sprint.
[31:50.380 --> 31:51.940]  I wish we could sprint up these ladders.
[31:53.040 --> 31:53.300]  Yeah.
[31:53.620 --> 31:55.180]  There's a way to go faster on them.
[32:01.620 --> 32:02.660]  Go down.
[32:03.120 --> 32:05.260]  Are we going? Okay, we are going.
[32:07.000 --> 32:07.440]  Okay.
[32:07.520 --> 32:08.180]  We got it.
[32:10.020 --> 32:10.900]  And going.
[32:12.320 --> 32:13.200]  Well done.
[32:13.460 --> 32:14.700]  Great job, everyone.
[32:15.740 --> 32:16.380]  Ah, yeah.
[32:17.580 --> 32:19.460]  Climb. I always in my brain
[32:19.460 --> 32:21.460]  think the ladder's to the right when we go on that one.
[32:21.620 --> 32:23.100]  And then I flip it in my head.
[32:23.540 --> 32:24.160]  It's the next one.
[32:25.380 --> 32:26.520]  Don't wanna overshoot.
[32:28.320 --> 32:29.100]  On this.
[32:31.140 --> 32:31.460]  Okay.
[32:32.740 --> 32:33.940]  Alright, the next time.
[32:34.220 --> 32:35.300]  Next time it comes.
[32:36.500 --> 32:37.260]  Here we go.
[32:38.140 --> 32:39.000]  That was...
[32:39.680 --> 32:40.460]  That sucked.
[32:41.700 --> 32:42.260]  Okay.
[32:45.600 --> 32:47.220]  Now start pulling us up.
[32:48.180 --> 32:49.300]  I'm very sorry.
[32:49.760 --> 32:51.360]  That, uh...
[32:51.360 --> 32:53.520]  My character just grabbed the thing before I could jump.
[32:54.140 --> 32:55.780]  I'm directly underneath
[32:55.780 --> 32:57.680]  and I don't know if I can...
[32:58.200 --> 32:59.880]  Gavin, why are you... Gavin, stop swinging.
[33:00.800 --> 33:01.800]  Andrew, you have to look at
[33:01.800 --> 33:02.980]  what you're... or Eric.
[33:03.460 --> 33:04.640]  What do you mean by that?
[33:04.680 --> 33:07.760]  You're swinging hard left and right.
[33:08.160 --> 33:09.600]  My hands are on my penis.
[33:10.640 --> 33:12.040]  How do I...
[33:12.040 --> 33:13.280]  That is in my lap.
[33:14.440 --> 33:15.860]  You're doing... What are you doing?
[33:17.720 --> 33:19.940]  If you can get Eric up, we'll be okay
[33:19.940 --> 33:21.260]  because you two can anchor us.
[33:22.960 --> 33:24.140]  I'm just gonna read the chat
[33:24.140 --> 33:25.500]  while I'm dangling above.
[33:25.660 --> 33:27.100]  Uh, hey everyone.
[33:28.040 --> 33:28.600]  Uh...
[33:30.040 --> 33:30.780]  Gavin's playing.
[33:31.060 --> 33:31.460]  I'm swinging.
[33:32.600 --> 33:33.940]  I'm almost there.
[33:35.340 --> 33:36.820]  I'm trying to
[33:36.820 --> 33:39.000]  not go too far off the side here.
[33:39.760 --> 33:40.600]  I'm stuck.
[33:40.940 --> 33:42.460]  I can't move.
[33:42.740 --> 33:44.780]  I'm stuck. You can see my insides.
[33:45.960 --> 33:47.060]  I don't have
[33:47.060 --> 33:48.360]  any more side to go.
[33:48.540 --> 33:50.860]  I understand. I'm trapped
[33:50.860 --> 33:52.240]  in the middle here.
[33:52.640 --> 33:52.960]  There we go.
[33:52.960 --> 33:53.580]  There we go.
[33:55.120 --> 33:57.100]  Okay. Now start
[33:57.100 --> 33:58.660]  pulling. Yeah, now pull.
[33:59.060 --> 33:59.360]  Pulling?
[34:01.580 --> 34:02.520]  Who are you pulling?
[34:03.420 --> 34:04.660]  I'm looking at you
[34:04.660 --> 34:06.340]  and I'm pulling. Okay.
[34:08.040 --> 34:09.080]  This is
[34:09.080 --> 34:09.540]  the worst.
[34:11.060 --> 34:12.880]  I mean, this is just a nightmare.
[34:14.980 --> 34:16.860]  I don't know what... I don't know
[34:16.860 --> 34:18.300]  how to get up from here.
[34:19.780 --> 34:21.140]  There's nothing I can do.
[34:22.640 --> 34:23.360]  Oh, there...
[34:26.570 --> 34:27.230]  I'm pulling
[34:27.230 --> 34:28.830]  as hard as I can.
[34:29.210 --> 34:30.650]  Nick, you're right here. Could you try?
[34:32.350 --> 34:33.170]  Yes, I'm...
[34:33.170 --> 34:34.070]  I would like to try.
[34:34.510 --> 34:36.410]  So Nick could get up
[34:37.050 --> 34:38.930]  the whole time. Nope.
[34:39.070 --> 34:40.450]  He could not from where he was originally.
[34:40.730 --> 34:42.990]  We figured it out. We adjusted...
[34:43.710 --> 34:44.990]  Gavin, there you go.
[34:45.110 --> 34:46.850]  There you go. He took his hands off his dick
[34:46.850 --> 34:48.450]  and he was able to just get right up there.
[34:49.130 --> 34:49.810]  We ready?
[34:50.550 --> 34:51.090]  Yeah.
[34:51.490 --> 34:52.350]  Let's go.
[34:53.850 --> 34:54.390]  Okay.
[34:59.830 --> 35:01.730]  Sometimes I can't see me.
[35:02.230 --> 35:03.270]  Yeah, it is.
[35:03.750 --> 35:05.470]  But then I feel like that's a good thing.
[35:05.530 --> 35:07.710]  If we're so grouped up, I can't see where I am.
[35:08.250 --> 35:09.370]  Then it's like...
[35:09.370 --> 35:11.750]  We're good. We'll get on the next one.
[35:14.110 --> 35:16.110]  It swings on back over.
[35:20.130 --> 35:21.330]  Let's go.
[35:26.970 --> 35:27.570]  Nice.
[35:28.670 --> 35:30.070]  Ladder to the right.
[35:30.550 --> 35:31.090]  Oh my God.
[35:31.310 --> 35:33.950]  I was not on the ladder.
[35:34.510 --> 35:35.230]  Ladder to the right?
[35:35.730 --> 35:38.010]  I'm just reminding myself for when we get across.
[35:38.450 --> 35:39.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:39.810 --> 35:41.030]  Ladder to the right.
[35:41.190 --> 35:43.970]  This is the first time I haven't gone left off that jump.
[35:44.510 --> 35:44.950]  Hahaha.
[35:47.970 --> 35:50.270]  And now we got...
[35:51.530 --> 35:52.410]  The swing.
[35:53.270 --> 35:53.910]  Let's wait.
[35:54.330 --> 35:55.310]  No, no, no. He has this thing.
[35:56.170 --> 35:56.490]  Now go.
[35:57.470 --> 35:58.910]  He said now go.
[36:00.250 --> 36:01.650]  Why did you say now go?
[36:01.670 --> 36:04.130]  Who the frickin' Nick? Why did you call it?
[36:05.010 --> 36:06.050]  That's an interesting question.
[36:06.530 --> 36:06.730]  Nick!
[36:08.610 --> 36:10.230]  He said now go.
[36:10.850 --> 36:12.370]  Nick, why did you say now go?
[36:12.370 --> 36:13.150]  Hahaha.
[36:14.090 --> 36:16.270]  Well, he said now go.
[36:16.450 --> 36:17.630]  I read the situation wrong.
[36:17.750 --> 36:18.310]  Yeah, hey.
[36:19.290 --> 36:20.670]  But I stopped.
[36:21.910 --> 36:24.050]  The problem was two people here.
[36:24.050 --> 36:25.670]  So really I'm double to blame.
[36:26.170 --> 36:27.050]  Yeah, hey.
[36:28.150 --> 36:30.050]  Nick, just now go.
[36:30.690 --> 36:31.590]  Yeah? No.
[36:32.790 --> 36:33.390]  What?
[36:33.610 --> 36:34.190]  I can go.
[36:35.290 --> 36:37.530]  That's fine. We're gonna get there.
[36:40.930 --> 36:42.130]  I uh...
[36:42.130 --> 36:43.610]  I hate this game.
[36:44.430 --> 36:46.390]  We need to get a checkpoint.
[36:47.110 --> 36:48.250]  We need to get to the
[36:48.250 --> 36:49.050]  first checkpoint.
[36:52.110 --> 36:53.670]  We were doing so good.
[36:53.870 --> 36:55.450]  Hey, huddle up, huddle up right now.
[36:55.990 --> 36:56.890]  Let's do a little huddle up.
[36:58.450 --> 37:00.130]  Eric, Eric, Eric.
[37:00.390 --> 37:00.770]  Get up!
[37:01.890 --> 37:02.750]  Opposite of huddling.
[37:03.570 --> 37:04.450]  Don't wanna be in the huddle.
[37:06.310 --> 37:08.110]  You're the guy when the rest of the team
[37:08.110 --> 37:09.090]  was like we need to come together.
[37:09.090 --> 37:10.510]  You're on the bench like I don't give a shit.
[37:11.290 --> 37:11.930]  Yeah, absolutely.
[37:12.310 --> 37:15.090]  When the rest of my team can't pull their weight, yeah, 100%.
[37:16.970 --> 37:18.050]  I don't see you doing nothing.
[37:18.410 --> 37:19.850]  You should see me not falling.
[37:20.850 --> 37:23.250]  You can't see me doing anything because you're all the way on the ground.
[37:23.390 --> 37:24.390]  Nick's stuck. Wait a second, wait a second.
[37:25.190 --> 37:25.730]  I'm fine.
[37:27.350 --> 37:28.770]  No, like his character got glitched.
[37:28.790 --> 37:29.350]  It wasn't his fault.
[37:30.790 --> 37:32.950]  I feel like the job of the middle person
[37:32.950 --> 37:34.690]  in the chain is just to yell at both sides.
[37:34.830 --> 37:37.210]  It's to justify the other people's problems.
[37:37.210 --> 37:38.810]  I'm trying to make sure
[37:38.810 --> 37:40.590]  we're all in sync.
[37:41.710 --> 37:43.310]  We can't even get to the first
[37:43.310 --> 37:43.870]  checkpoint.
[37:44.630 --> 37:45.690]  You've done it before.
[37:47.110 --> 37:47.970]  We were there.
[37:48.710 --> 37:50.430]  Okay, guys.
[37:51.390 --> 37:52.410]  We're a little separated.
[37:53.090 --> 37:54.070]  Gavin, what happened?
[37:54.830 --> 37:56.090]  He ran out of slack.
[37:56.330 --> 37:57.450]  He was going as fast as he could.
[37:59.050 --> 38:00.670]  So we just gotta keep communicating.
[38:01.270 --> 38:01.730]  There we go.
[38:03.090 --> 38:03.710]  There we go.
[38:03.710 --> 38:04.290]  Okay.
[38:06.170 --> 38:07.410]  Good job, everyone.
[38:08.530 --> 38:09.670]  Okay, let's go up.
[38:11.050 --> 38:11.710]  It would be great
[38:11.710 --> 38:13.730]  to see more of hell. Hey, thanks for the fucking
[38:13.730 --> 38:14.210]  intro.
[38:14.910 --> 38:16.210]  It really would be.
[38:17.310 --> 38:18.670]  This is the best version.
[38:23.230 --> 38:23.650]  Respectfully.
[38:23.810 --> 38:24.290]  Thank you.
[38:25.770 --> 38:26.190]  Okay.
[38:27.650 --> 38:28.070]  Nice.
[38:29.930 --> 38:32.170]  I too would like to see more of this place.
[38:32.170 --> 38:33.090]  Oh my god.
[38:34.050 --> 38:34.490]  Andrew.
[38:35.730 --> 38:38.110]  I climbed a statue. I got a new view.
[38:38.630 --> 38:39.870]  Are you okay, bud?
[38:40.010 --> 38:42.010]  I was just checking the field. I wanted to make sure
[38:42.010 --> 38:43.970]  that everything was all good up ahead. We're all good.
[38:45.030 --> 38:45.910]  Nothing unexpected.
[38:50.180 --> 38:52.120]  Whenever we climb this, I just imagine
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.480]  somebody flinging a cookie sheet
[38:54.480 --> 38:55.080]  up and down.
[38:56.180 --> 38:58.100]  Waving it to try to get that sound.
[38:59.740 --> 39:00.580]  It's going mental.
[39:00.780 --> 39:01.900]  Like they're flapping like a bird.
[39:01.900 --> 39:02.800]  Are we ready?
[39:03.980 --> 39:05.000]  Yes, apparently.
[39:07.500 --> 39:09.660]  Hold on, I'm glitched.
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.200]  Good. Let's hit the other one.
[39:14.960 --> 39:15.580]  Jump around!
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.820]  I don't know which ones we wait for.
[39:18.500 --> 39:20.100]  When did we count to the first
[39:20.100 --> 39:20.780]  trampoline ever?
[39:22.000 --> 39:23.900]  It just doesn't hurt to take
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.760]  a moment before any jump, I would say.
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.400]  Just a breath.
[39:29.140 --> 39:29.800]  Oh, this
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.660]  frickin' bone bit for the
[39:31.660 --> 39:32.680]  18th time.
[39:32.860 --> 39:36.960]  I think this is like a rack of ribs
[39:36.960 --> 39:39.340]  at one point. Yeah, all laid out.
[39:39.480 --> 39:40.240]  Some chicken wings.
[39:45.420 --> 39:47.700]  Did Chili's get rid of their baby back ribs?
[39:48.060 --> 39:48.980]  There's no way.
[39:49.260 --> 39:50.480]  No, they still have them.
[39:51.020 --> 39:52.320]  They do? I think so.
[39:54.080 --> 39:54.800]  Triple dipper?
[39:55.500 --> 39:56.860]  Yeah, triple dipper.
[39:57.180 --> 39:58.100]  Just baby backs.
[39:58.700 --> 40:00.260]  Get enough sodium for a week and a meal.
[40:00.540 --> 40:02.420]  No kidding. It makes you feel so bad.
[40:03.600 --> 40:04.660]  That is a dish
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.960]  that really saves itself in the last word.
[40:09.620 --> 40:10.720]  What? Baby back ribs.
[40:11.340 --> 40:11.600]  Uh oh.
[40:17.260 --> 40:18.780]  I was like half
[40:18.780 --> 40:19.040]  on.
[40:20.860 --> 40:22.660]  Alright, I'm gonna wait by this tramp.
[40:22.660 --> 40:24.160]  We're all waiting.
[40:24.460 --> 40:26.260]  I'm here. Okay, we ready?
[40:26.680 --> 40:27.220]  Let's do it.
[40:27.480 --> 40:30.640]  Nobody called it
[40:30.640 --> 40:32.600]  and we just sort of did it in a weird
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.200]  order where nobody called it.
[40:35.900 --> 40:38.300]  My understanding is that the two ends
[40:38.300 --> 40:39.920]  would be the ones to do that.
[40:40.320 --> 40:40.840]  I jumped.
[40:41.660 --> 40:43.520]  You didn't say anything.
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.160]  That was
[40:47.260 --> 40:48.500]  the most realistic
[40:48.500 --> 40:50.760]  trampoline jump I think we've ever had in this game.
[40:50.760 --> 40:52.760]  We went an appropriate
[40:52.760 --> 40:54.620]  distance. I will say, and
[40:54.620 --> 40:56.340]  Nick, this is not a judgment of you,
[40:56.760 --> 40:58.580]  maybe you should not call it anymore.
[41:01.420 --> 41:02.700]  Nick keeps just
[41:02.700 --> 41:04.280]  murdering me with little words.
[41:05.180 --> 41:06.480]  Maybe, Nick, you should
[41:06.480 --> 41:08.360]  refrain from calling it.
[41:08.480 --> 41:09.680]  And I'm not saying that was your fault.
[41:09.680 --> 41:12.860]  You can call it, but just be the...
[41:12.860 --> 41:14.720]  I feel like
[41:14.720 --> 41:16.700]  we have a problem where sometimes someone
[41:16.700 --> 41:18.940]  will set the stage and then Nick will be there.
[41:18.940 --> 41:20.480]  You know what? Absolutely.
[41:20.660 --> 41:22.580]  I'm just gonna hang back. But I get it.
[41:22.720 --> 41:23.560]  And it's not your fault.
[41:24.220 --> 41:24.980]  No, it's okay.
[41:27.280 --> 41:28.540]  I'll take my lumps.
[41:30.280 --> 41:30.840]  We're getting
[41:30.840 --> 41:32.480]  really good at this though. We're fast.
[41:32.620 --> 41:34.120]  We don't even need to communicate the jumps.
[41:34.740 --> 41:36.740]  It's the most times we've fallen
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.540]  so early. And it's the most
[41:38.540 --> 41:39.960]  experience we've ever been.
[41:41.080 --> 41:42.660]  The experience hasn't helped
[41:42.660 --> 41:44.780]  so far. Remember when we were driving
[41:44.780 --> 41:45.740]  the car? I'm sorry.
[41:46.380 --> 41:47.740]  Maybe not all of us driving
[41:47.740 --> 41:49.620]  the car. Do you remember when the car flew
[41:49.620 --> 41:51.620]  all the way off? I've never
[41:51.620 --> 41:53.700]  driven the car. That's true.
[41:53.980 --> 41:55.500]  Nick has never once driven the car.
[41:56.160 --> 41:57.380]  Nick should drive the car next time.
[41:57.700 --> 41:59.400]  Nick should drive the car!
[41:59.940 --> 42:01.560]  And how does one drive it?
[42:01.780 --> 42:03.120]  I think you have to get in it first.
[42:03.700 --> 42:04.020]  Yeah.
[42:07.940 --> 42:09.820]  How does one drive it?
[42:13.760 --> 42:14.200]  Okay.
[42:17.340 --> 42:17.780]  Okay.
[42:18.800 --> 42:20.140]  Okay, here we go.
[42:21.980 --> 42:24.040]  And then we're more beautiful.
[42:27.740 --> 42:29.720]  And let's navigate this.
[42:30.860 --> 42:32.060]  Get to the cookie sheets.
[42:34.300 --> 42:35.320]  What? Oh.
[42:35.780 --> 42:38.020]  You think it was like a cat standing on tin foil?
[42:38.100 --> 42:38.940]  Like, what is this?
[42:39.120 --> 42:40.720]  What is this noise in real life?
[42:44.490 --> 42:45.530]  Oh, that's a good question.
[42:47.510 --> 42:49.050]  Because it's certainly not this.
[42:50.430 --> 42:50.610]  No.
[42:51.490 --> 42:53.590]  It's almost a chain link fence, but not quite.
[42:53.690 --> 42:55.130]  Yeah, it's halfway there. Okay.
[42:55.430 --> 42:55.870]  1, 2, 3!
[42:57.090 --> 42:57.870]  1, 2, 3, go.
[42:59.570 --> 43:00.370]  1, 2, 3, go.
[43:01.490 --> 43:03.250]  Uh-oh. 1, 2, 3, go.
[43:04.150 --> 43:04.950]  Uh-oh.
[43:06.130 --> 43:07.630]  I got a bit of a gnarly bounce.
[43:08.090 --> 43:08.330]  Yeah.
[43:09.610 --> 43:11.210]  I got, like, sibling bounced.
[43:12.630 --> 43:13.030]  Oh.
[43:13.870 --> 43:15.190]  The super bounce? Yeah.
[43:15.190 --> 43:16.430]  Oh, I love the super bounce.
[43:16.430 --> 43:17.550]  This is the one that breaks your legs?
[43:17.970 --> 43:18.270]  Yeah.
[43:22.160 --> 43:24.580]  Hey, do you guys know if Chili still
[43:24.580 --> 43:25.380]  sells its baby back ribs?
[43:28.360 --> 43:29.380]  That'd be ridiculous.
[43:32.660 --> 43:34.200]  No, they got the triple dipper now.
[43:34.940 --> 43:36.320]  Do you think you could tell apart
[43:36.840 --> 43:38.780]  the difference between Chili's
[43:38.780 --> 43:40.940]  and TGI Friday's
[43:40.940 --> 43:42.300]  and Outback
[43:42.300 --> 43:43.320]  and all their ribs?
[43:44.540 --> 43:45.720]  Not on ribs.
[43:45.780 --> 43:46.620]  Probably not.
[43:48.060 --> 43:49.500]  I bet on most of the food
[43:49.500 --> 43:50.420]  I wouldn't be able to.
[43:52.960 --> 43:53.420]  You know,
[43:53.880 --> 43:55.500]  I'm just gonna say this, Chili's is a coward
[43:55.500 --> 43:57.860]  for getting rid of their awesome blossom or whatever the fuck it was called.
[43:57.980 --> 43:59.000]  Do they not have one anymore?
[43:59.800 --> 44:01.180]  No, they don't. Oh, crazy.
[44:02.500 --> 44:03.480]  Chili's is a coward
[44:03.480 --> 44:05.460]  because they got rid of their awesome blossom.
[44:06.880 --> 44:07.500]  You know what?
[44:07.620 --> 44:09.140]  Nick, I've been thinking it for years,
[44:09.300 --> 44:11.840]  and I'm glad that you had the courage to say it.
[44:11.840 --> 44:13.680]  Finally someone said it.
[44:15.960 --> 44:16.640]  Okay.
[44:18.040 --> 44:18.720]  Okay.
[44:19.680 --> 44:22.300]  That was insane, but we're fine.
[44:22.380 --> 44:22.760]  Yeah, Gavin ate it.
[44:23.100 --> 44:25.240]  Okay, next one.
[44:25.700 --> 44:26.500]  Here we go.
[44:29.160 --> 44:30.280]  Great work!
[44:30.440 --> 44:30.660]  Okay.
[44:33.340 --> 44:34.520]  Back at it.
[44:37.480 --> 44:40.100]  What? Chili's has weirdly good chips
[44:40.100 --> 44:42.200]  and queso con carne? Get the fuck out of here.
[44:42.460 --> 44:43.440]  Get him, Nick, get him.
[44:44.060 --> 44:46.380]  It's just meat with some
[44:46.380 --> 44:47.420]  melted cheese on it.
[44:48.740 --> 44:49.640]  I don't know.
[44:50.340 --> 44:51.560]  I've only had Chili's once.
[44:51.940 --> 44:53.940]  I can't comment on the queso.
[44:54.920 --> 44:55.960]  It's not queso.
[44:56.420 --> 44:57.080]  It's just...
[44:57.080 --> 44:59.380]  It's like a weird grey
[45:00.260 --> 45:00.740]  slop.
[45:01.980 --> 45:03.280]  And then we'll reset at the next one.
[45:05.560 --> 45:07.800]  You went way too high.
[45:09.620 --> 45:10.560]  That was me.
[45:10.700 --> 45:11.400]  That was me, but that's fine.
[45:11.520 --> 45:11.900]  We recovered.
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.020]  I went too high.
[45:14.800 --> 45:15.780]  We all make mistakes.
[45:17.620 --> 45:19.200]  At least we didn't go all the way to the bottom.
[45:22.020 --> 45:22.440]  Yep.
[45:23.340 --> 45:24.820]  We're getting really good at this.
[45:25.820 --> 45:26.920]  I got caught up.
[45:27.020 --> 45:28.000]  I was thinking about Chili's.
[45:28.380 --> 45:30.840]  It's climbing a ladder.
[45:31.180 --> 45:33.140]  We're getting really good at this.
[45:33.380 --> 45:35.740]  Trying to find anything positive
[45:35.740 --> 45:36.820]  to say.
[45:36.820 --> 45:38.620]  I'm the glue guy.
[45:38.760 --> 45:40.480]  I'm trying to morale.
[45:41.240 --> 45:43.280]  I'm going to be low.
[45:43.500 --> 45:44.440]  Wait, wait, wait.
[45:44.900 --> 45:45.180]  Go.
[45:48.040 --> 45:49.320]  Oh, Nick.
[45:49.980 --> 45:51.400]  I don't know what happened.
[45:51.700 --> 45:52.480]  I don't know what happened.
[45:53.060 --> 45:53.760]  Andrew, down.
[45:55.100 --> 45:56.380]  I'm here.
[45:56.980 --> 45:59.740]  I don't understand what you don't understand
[45:59.740 --> 46:01.700]  about this specifically, Andrew.
[46:02.240 --> 46:03.080]  Calm down.
[46:03.080 --> 46:05.100]  Nick was dangling.
[46:05.120 --> 46:05.840]  I was looking at Nick.
[46:05.920 --> 46:08.000]  I do not know why I fell.
[46:08.260 --> 46:09.540]  I apologize for that.
[46:10.160 --> 46:11.220]  Walked in on Nick.
[46:12.840 --> 46:13.880]  You're too high.
[46:15.100 --> 46:15.960]  Go now.
[46:17.040 --> 46:18.160]  What's happening?
[46:18.580 --> 46:21.060]  Nick was dangling around below.
[46:21.460 --> 46:22.620]  It was very distracting.
[46:23.160 --> 46:23.540]  We're good.
[46:23.640 --> 46:24.840]  Gavin is too low.
[46:25.220 --> 46:25.900]  We are fucked.
[46:26.500 --> 46:28.840]  We're all good.
[46:30.280 --> 46:31.180]  Hey, this ladder.
[46:31.340 --> 46:31.820]  Guys.
[46:32.600 --> 46:33.320]  Shut up.
[46:33.360 --> 46:37.180]  Shut up.
[46:37.340 --> 46:38.680]  The ladder is on the left.
[46:38.880 --> 46:39.620]  Next one is on the right.
[46:41.440 --> 46:42.380]  I'll remember that next time.
[46:43.420 --> 46:43.660]  Okay.
[46:44.540 --> 46:45.280]  Next one.
[46:46.160 --> 46:47.040]  Next one.
[46:48.260 --> 46:50.000]  I'm not supposed to say anything anymore.
[46:53.500 --> 46:54.500]  Gavin didn't make it.
[46:55.240 --> 46:55.880]  He sure didn't.
[46:58.140 --> 46:58.900]  I'm trying.
[46:59.600 --> 47:00.080]  No!
[47:00.780 --> 47:01.000]  I'm trying.
[47:02.760 --> 47:04.360]  My perspective of...
[47:04.360 --> 47:06.360]  There is something happening.
[47:06.620 --> 47:10.120]  What I'm seeing is not what is happening in this game.
[47:11.540 --> 47:12.580]  It's the lag.
[47:13.920 --> 47:15.680]  That had to have been a tremendous amount.
[47:15.680 --> 47:15.780]  It's fine.
[47:16.480 --> 47:18.540]  Guys, I'll save us. It's okay.
[47:19.480 --> 47:19.680]  Okay.
[47:20.520 --> 47:22.500]  On my screen, I made it.
[47:22.500 --> 47:24.000]  And then I got pulled off.
[47:24.160 --> 47:25.680]  And then I made it. And then it was off.
[47:26.100 --> 47:27.320]  Everyone else wants to be the leader.
[47:27.500 --> 47:27.820]  It's fine.
[47:28.080 --> 47:29.740]  Everyone wants their chance.
[47:30.560 --> 47:31.640]  Gavin, do you want to call it out?
[47:32.320 --> 47:33.320]  3, 2, 1.
[47:33.400 --> 47:33.780]  And go.
[47:38.420 --> 47:39.140]  Hang on.
[47:39.500 --> 47:40.060]  Sit tight.
[47:41.160 --> 47:41.460]  It's fine.
[47:43.520 --> 47:45.560]  Everyone just be standing on their feet.
[47:45.720 --> 47:46.160]  On their legs.
[47:46.440 --> 47:47.260]  Keep going.
[47:47.540 --> 47:50.140]  Everybody stand on their legs.
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.180]  We're getting really good at crossing these bridges, guys.
[47:53.180 --> 47:53.740]  Keep it up.
[47:55.400 --> 47:58.300]  I'm going to need you to not say that anymore, please.
[47:58.420 --> 47:59.200]  Oh, man.
[48:00.060 --> 48:01.040]  Oh, man.
[48:01.380 --> 48:02.420]  Yeah, let's get on this.
[48:02.860 --> 48:05.040]  Alright, remember?
[48:05.460 --> 48:05.760]  Jumpy.
[48:06.900 --> 48:07.420]  Jumpy.
[48:08.800 --> 48:09.320]  Nice.
[48:10.260 --> 48:13.340]  And we go on the barrels, then to the right.
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.320]  Barrels of fun.
[48:18.320 --> 48:19.240]  Barrels of fun.
[48:19.420 --> 48:19.660]  Oh, my God.
[48:19.660 --> 48:20.800]  Oh, my God.
[48:21.660 --> 48:22.500]  I'm pulling them.
[48:22.620 --> 48:23.000]  I'm pulling them.
[48:26.080 --> 48:26.960]  Can't do it.
[48:27.820 --> 48:28.740]  This isn't hard.
[48:29.880 --> 48:30.840]  It's a fun barrel.
[48:31.020 --> 48:32.620]  It's a barrel of fun.
[48:33.180 --> 48:35.020]  I don't know what is happening.
[48:36.120 --> 48:36.980]  There you go.
[48:38.800 --> 48:39.800]  What were you saying?
[48:40.300 --> 48:41.000]  I just can't do it.
[48:41.100 --> 48:41.420]  Let's go.
[48:42.580 --> 48:44.880]  To the right.
[48:46.320 --> 48:47.600]  Great job, everyone.
[48:48.440 --> 48:50.000]  Now, this was my fault last time.
[48:50.060 --> 48:52.000]  So, I'm just going to hang out.
[48:53.780 --> 48:56.340]  Gavin, are you okay?
[48:56.820 --> 48:57.600]  I don't think so.
[48:59.880 --> 49:01.940]  Okay, we're almost at the grabbing bit.
[49:02.060 --> 49:02.740]  And then Nick can drive.
[49:02.820 --> 49:03.740]  We got to get Nick in the car.
[49:04.660 --> 49:04.880]  No.
[49:05.580 --> 49:05.980]  Go.
[49:09.780 --> 49:11.440]  What is happening with this car?
[49:11.800 --> 49:12.660]  I don't know.
[49:12.780 --> 49:13.700]  Why did you go?
[49:13.700 --> 49:14.920]  We always go.
[49:15.640 --> 49:16.620]  We're here.
[49:16.800 --> 49:17.460]  We made it.
[49:17.720 --> 49:20.600]  Oh, my God.
[49:21.220 --> 49:21.520]  We're fine.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.860]  You guys are fucking psychopaths.
[49:24.900 --> 49:27.580]  Three, two, one, go.
[49:27.900 --> 49:31.220]  I still don't know which ones people are going to go for.
[49:31.780 --> 49:33.320]  This one we call.
[49:33.880 --> 49:36.540]  We've done it every time we made it here today.
[49:38.120 --> 49:39.580]  Good job, Gavin.
[49:40.440 --> 49:42.080]  Get that core work in.
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.220]  Gavin, how's the oxygen levels?
[49:45.500 --> 49:47.220]  Not great. I think I need to open a window.
[49:49.460 --> 49:51.700]  Maybe I can separate...
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.400]  Sorry, go ahead.
[49:56.200 --> 49:57.460]  I was just going to say,
[49:57.540 --> 49:59.840]  I went without saying anything because we had enough slack
[49:59.840 --> 50:01.340]  for me to be there and not pull.
[50:01.800 --> 50:03.560]  That's why I did that jump.
[50:04.040 --> 50:06.000]  Oh, you'll be hearing from me on slack for sure.
[50:09.120 --> 50:10.780]  You better make a channel for it.
[50:11.420 --> 50:12.220]  Bring it back, Geoff.
[50:12.300 --> 50:14.340]  I wish Geoff was here.
[50:15.020 --> 50:16.660]  Alright, fine. I'll take the lead.
[50:16.900 --> 50:17.620]  Alright, you got it.
[50:17.820 --> 50:18.580]  You got this, Nick.
[50:20.180 --> 50:21.140]  I missed him too, chat.
[50:21.720 --> 50:22.840]  Alright, so what moves?
[50:24.100 --> 50:25.500]  You got the right trigger.
[50:31.210 --> 50:32.010]  What moves?
[50:33.150 --> 50:33.630]  Well, you know.
[50:34.190 --> 50:35.870]  I say that whenever I get into my car.
[50:37.890 --> 50:38.290]  Flawless.
[50:38.930 --> 50:39.650]  You got it.
[50:39.650 --> 50:41.170]  Watch out for the holes. You're fine.
[50:46.410 --> 50:47.650]  It's different, Gavin.
[50:47.810 --> 50:49.310]  Gavin, it's different on our screen.
[50:49.630 --> 50:52.390]  The only time you have to worry
[50:52.390 --> 50:54.410]  is if it backs up or stops.
[50:54.750 --> 50:55.850]  That's when you go,
[50:55.970 --> 50:57.650]  oh, this is bad all the way.
[50:58.030 --> 50:59.930]  But the spinny things,
[51:00.350 --> 51:01.290]  that's not in sync.
[51:05.200 --> 51:05.720]  Yeehaw.
[51:07.320 --> 51:09.080]  Guarantee Nick didn't touch it
[51:09.080 --> 51:10.300]  I didn't touch it.
[51:10.840 --> 51:12.640]  Nick absolutely smashed it.
[51:12.800 --> 51:15.180]  Great work.
[51:17.180 --> 51:18.580]  Who's calling this one out?
[51:19.880 --> 51:21.220]  We'll wait until it touches
[51:21.220 --> 51:22.900]  and then we'll go as soon as it touches.
[51:28.880 --> 51:30.120]  Here we go.
[51:30.840 --> 51:31.940]  This is us.
[51:32.800 --> 51:34.040]  This is us.
[51:34.700 --> 51:36.640]  Is it just random the way it turns?
[51:36.640 --> 51:37.740]  I think so.
[51:38.140 --> 51:39.080]  It is.
[51:42.480 --> 51:44.100]  After the next one.
[51:44.460 --> 51:44.920]  Here we go.
[51:47.740 --> 51:49.180]  Good work.
[51:50.240 --> 51:52.040]  Womp's Fortress, here we go.
[51:52.480 --> 51:52.940]  Oh boy.
[51:54.100 --> 51:55.460]  Good job, we're all
[51:56.760 --> 51:58.200]  one currently.
[51:58.580 --> 51:59.300]  Nice.
[52:00.460 --> 52:01.420]  Let's stay grouped.
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.440]  I missed it.
[52:04.820 --> 52:05.700]  Oh, I missed.
[52:06.180 --> 52:08.660]  Here, I'll just drop down so we're synced again.
[52:08.860 --> 52:09.920]  Yeah, let's all get on the same level.
[52:10.940 --> 52:11.680]  Nick's going to go for it.
[52:12.720 --> 52:13.280]  Oh boy.
[52:15.200 --> 52:16.660]  We've tied the tower in a knot again.
[52:16.900 --> 52:17.500]  We've tied it in a knot.
[52:17.900 --> 52:20.500]  You're going to loop the loop.
[52:21.980 --> 52:23.160]  It won't let me grab.
[52:23.600 --> 52:24.800]  It won't let me grab the ledge.
[52:26.040 --> 52:26.860]  I'm in hell.
[52:28.280 --> 52:28.840]  The chain
[52:28.840 --> 52:30.020]  doesn't know what to do.
[52:31.700 --> 52:32.340]  There we go.
[52:32.340 --> 52:33.180]  I swung it back.
[52:34.380 --> 52:35.860]  Sorry Nick, too late.
[52:40.100 --> 52:41.620]  Andrew, you have to pull him up.
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.280]  There you go.
[52:43.840 --> 52:44.660]  Nice job, Andrew.
[52:47.400 --> 52:48.700]  Back we go.
[52:48.960 --> 52:49.600]  I'm coming down.
[52:50.780 --> 52:51.720]  What was the illusion?
[52:52.380 --> 52:53.520]  The illusion of success?
[52:54.000 --> 52:54.800]  It was, yeah.
[52:56.820 --> 52:58.340]  Of grandeur, I think.
[52:58.780 --> 52:59.600]  Delusion of grandeur.
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.220]  Okay, we did it.
[53:01.280 --> 53:02.680]  We could make that jump.
[53:03.660 --> 53:05.800]  We could, but why risk it?
[53:06.020 --> 53:06.860]  Let's just be safe.
[53:07.460 --> 53:09.160]  Let's just take the ten seconds.
[53:11.840 --> 53:13.680]  There we go. Okay, we good? Let's go.
[53:15.680 --> 53:16.760]  Great job.
[53:17.020 --> 53:19.720]  This is not all go, it's one at a time.
[53:20.660 --> 53:20.860]  Okay.
[53:21.380 --> 53:23.520]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:25.300 --> 53:27.540]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:29.700 --> 53:31.720]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:33.820 --> 53:35.900]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:37.760 --> 53:39.780]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:41.780 --> 53:43.980]  Three, two, one, go.
[53:44.840 --> 53:46.200]  You make little grunts every time.
[53:46.300 --> 53:46.800]  Oh my god.
[53:48.160 --> 53:48.960]  Alright, let's go.
[53:49.380 --> 53:51.120]  Is this the furthest we made it or not?
[53:51.400 --> 53:51.820]  Yes.
[53:52.460 --> 53:53.780]  In this stream, yes.
[53:54.160 --> 53:56.000]  Oh really? Good for us.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.960]  We fell at that the first time.
[53:58.020 --> 53:59.520]  Easy, easy, easy, easy, wait, wait, wait.
[54:00.060 --> 54:01.560]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[54:01.680 --> 54:03.040]  I was already moving as you said.
[54:03.940 --> 54:04.620]  I'm back.
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.620]  Three, two, one, go.
[54:08.060 --> 54:10.480]  And now let's not immediately go on the trampoline.
[54:11.260 --> 54:11.860]  Yeah, agreed.
[54:12.460 --> 54:13.460]  Where are we going?
[54:13.980 --> 54:15.340]  Right in front of us.
[54:15.720 --> 54:17.840]  Three, two, one, go.
[54:21.060 --> 54:22.400]  So now, hang on.
[54:22.620 --> 54:24.800]  So now I think we have to land and just go.
[54:24.800 --> 54:25.880]  Right? Yes.
[54:26.020 --> 54:29.080]  So next one, we start and we just go all the way across.
[54:29.200 --> 54:29.340]  Yeah.
[54:30.140 --> 54:31.420]  Okay, let's do it.
[54:33.860 --> 54:35.140]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, hang on.
[54:35.560 --> 54:36.500]  I'm getting farted around.
[54:36.720 --> 54:37.240]  Go, go, go.
[54:38.460 --> 54:39.820]  All the way, all the way, all the way, all the way.
[54:40.420 --> 54:42.460]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[54:43.080 --> 54:44.940]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[54:45.200 --> 54:46.180]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[54:47.520 --> 54:48.520]  Good job everyone.
[54:49.000 --> 54:49.800]  Hang on, hang on.
[54:51.260 --> 54:52.380]  Don't, do not.
[54:52.380 --> 54:54.180]  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[54:54.280 --> 54:55.960]  I'm down. Chill.
[54:56.460 --> 54:58.260]  I'm not going to throw you the fuck off.
[54:58.420 --> 55:00.140]  I will throw you down.
[55:02.280 --> 55:03.520]  It's only a button.
[55:04.540 --> 55:05.600]  Gavin. What's up man?
[55:05.960 --> 55:08.320]  You're going to be the one to hit the button. Nick's going to be in the front.
[55:08.740 --> 55:10.360]  So when we start, we have
[55:12.020 --> 55:13.540]  the shortest line to it. Ready?
[55:14.220 --> 55:14.760]  Go for it.
[55:16.540 --> 55:17.880]  On three or three and then go?
[55:18.240 --> 55:19.440]  Three, two, one.
[55:20.260 --> 55:20.700]  Hahaha.
[55:21.700 --> 55:23.260]  Remember, you can jump these without
[55:23.260 --> 55:24.400]  catching. Yeah, you can.
[55:25.840 --> 55:26.520]  Go grab this.
[55:27.720 --> 55:29.160]  I'm grabbing every single one.
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.160]  Cool. I did the same thing.
[55:33.580 --> 55:34.800]  Almost there, almost there. We're good.
[55:36.880 --> 55:38.120]  Plenty of time, plenty of time.
[55:38.640 --> 55:39.140]  Plenty of time.
[55:39.660 --> 55:39.900]  Easy.
[55:40.900 --> 55:41.340]  Okay.
[55:42.980 --> 55:43.860]  Alright, so.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.460]  Just two and we're there, right?
[55:47.460 --> 55:49.420]  Okay, so Andrew, you want to call it off?
[55:49.640 --> 55:50.440]  Do we want to wait?
[55:52.040 --> 55:53.460]  I'll do the countdown on both.
[55:53.700 --> 55:55.520]  Three, two, one,
[55:55.720 --> 55:56.000]  go.
[55:57.000 --> 55:57.460]  Easy.
[56:00.880 --> 56:01.840]  Three, two,
[56:02.140 --> 56:02.900]  one, go.
[56:03.920 --> 56:04.400]  Great.
[56:04.860 --> 56:07.000]  Three, two, one, go.
[56:07.320 --> 56:09.460]  It is the easiest jump, but the checkpoint
[56:09.460 --> 56:10.500]  is right here. Yep.
[56:11.060 --> 56:13.160]  Is this the checkpoint? I think so, coming up.
[56:13.500 --> 56:14.400]  Oh, oh.
[56:14.400 --> 56:16.460]  Andrew almost did it.
[56:16.500 --> 56:17.000]  Get on it.
[56:17.920 --> 56:20.100]  That is one of those
[56:20.100 --> 56:21.920]  developer things where you know what they did.
[56:22.080 --> 56:23.060]  They did that on purpose.
[56:24.120 --> 56:24.820]  They're hoping.
[56:26.180 --> 56:28.120]  I think we might checkpoint in the water thing.
[56:28.380 --> 56:29.760]  Yeah, I don't think this is the checkpoint yet.
[56:29.860 --> 56:30.520]  I think we have to keep going.
[56:31.060 --> 56:32.460]  Getting close to 501.
[56:33.740 --> 56:35.040]  We're getting there, we're getting there.
[56:35.280 --> 56:36.280]  We're very close.
[56:39.520 --> 56:41.300]  So we never have to ever do that
[56:41.300 --> 56:42.440]  first bit again, right? Ever?
[56:42.440 --> 56:43.520]  No, hang on.
[56:44.020 --> 56:45.220]  Let's not say that yet.
[56:45.440 --> 56:46.900]  Let's get to the checkpoint.
[56:48.980 --> 56:50.320]  What does the checkpoint look like?
[56:51.280 --> 56:52.500]  I don't know, actually.
[56:52.580 --> 56:54.160]  I don't know, but we're almost there
[56:54.160 --> 56:56.340]  if you look over on the top left of your map.
[56:58.260 --> 56:58.700]  Oh!
[56:58.880 --> 56:59.700]  Good call out, Eric.
[56:59.800 --> 57:01.340]  I didn't notice that, the three markers.
[57:03.400 --> 57:04.500]  Oh, a
[57:04.500 --> 57:05.740]  pillar with a circle around it.
[57:06.380 --> 57:08.120]  I'm pretty excited to see one of those.
[57:09.680 --> 57:10.400]  Me too.
[57:10.400 --> 57:12.600]  You'll know it when you see it.
[57:19.330 --> 57:20.170]  Awfully quiet.
[57:20.630 --> 57:22.630]  Breathe a little bit. It's been so stressful
[57:22.630 --> 57:23.210]  to get here.
[57:23.550 --> 57:25.810]  You should somehow make it so that
[57:25.810 --> 57:28.090]  chat can control one of the people.
[57:28.650 --> 57:30.290]  You're a psycho.
[57:31.090 --> 57:32.630]  You're absolutely insane.
[57:33.090 --> 57:33.770]  What do you mean?
[57:35.250 --> 57:36.110]  Where are we?
[57:36.210 --> 57:37.810]  Oh, we have to hit all these buttons.
[57:37.810 --> 57:38.270]  Yeah.
[57:44.870 --> 57:46.310]  Nick, where are you going?
[57:47.730 --> 57:48.090]  Nowhere.
[57:49.670 --> 57:50.550]  Just tell us
[57:50.550 --> 57:52.630]  where you're going and we can help you get there.
[57:52.870 --> 57:54.430]  It doesn't have to just be you going
[57:54.430 --> 57:55.250]  in a direction.
[57:56.630 --> 57:57.650]  But I want to do it.
[57:59.010 --> 58:00.650]  I'm going to get up here and hit this last button
[58:00.650 --> 58:01.230]  and then we'll go down.
[58:01.370 --> 58:03.050]  I got it.
[58:03.730 --> 58:04.310]  Alright, cool.
[58:04.530 --> 58:05.270]  There we go.
[58:05.270 --> 58:07.250]  That should be...
[58:07.250 --> 58:08.670]  There we go. Checkpoint?
[58:09.870 --> 58:10.430]  Checkpoint, please.
[58:11.350 --> 58:13.030]  Is that it? I don't think so.
[58:13.210 --> 58:14.450]  Easy. Hang on. Hang on.
[58:14.490 --> 58:16.390]  Hold on. There's still loads to do.
[58:20.310 --> 58:21.230]  Okay. We got to make
[58:21.230 --> 58:23.150]  this jump and then we're good. Here we go.
[58:30.250 --> 58:31.150]  Hang on. Hang on.
[58:31.290 --> 58:31.710]  Next one.
[58:31.710 --> 58:33.490]  Wait. Wait. Wait.
[58:33.490 --> 58:33.550]  Wait. Wait.
[58:35.090 --> 58:35.690]  Go.
[58:38.110 --> 58:39.630]  We can't muff it up
[58:39.630 --> 58:41.610]  now, guys. We have to be strong.
[58:41.610 --> 58:42.850]  No, we've come so far.
[58:43.610 --> 58:44.130]  Hang on.
[58:44.930 --> 58:45.230]  Get up.
[58:47.590 --> 58:48.190]  Go.
[58:49.850 --> 58:50.450]  Left.
[58:51.710 --> 58:52.070]  There you go.
[58:56.210 --> 58:57.190]  5-0-1!
[58:58.270 --> 58:59.310]  5-0-1!
[58:59.750 --> 59:00.710]  Shout out to everyone
[59:00.710 --> 59:02.430]  finishing work right now.
[59:02.790 --> 59:03.230]  Nice.
[59:06.890 --> 59:07.690]  Hey, we're not.
[59:08.850 --> 59:10.270]  Lots of 5-0-1s in the chat.
[59:11.490 --> 59:12.810]  Next time. Next time it goes.
[59:13.290 --> 59:13.830]  What do you mean next time?
[59:13.950 --> 59:15.390]  What does that mean?
[59:15.590 --> 59:17.810]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[59:18.370 --> 59:19.530]  It's so fast.
[59:20.310 --> 59:21.330]  Just count it.
[59:25.530 --> 59:26.730]  There's actually enough slack
[59:26.730 --> 59:28.370]  that we can go at different times.
[59:29.330 --> 59:30.350]  Next time it
[59:30.850 --> 59:31.250]  goes.
[59:31.450 --> 59:33.890]  My brain broke.
[59:35.030 --> 59:36.530]  That was crazy.
[59:37.630 --> 59:38.370]  We made it.
[59:39.190 --> 59:39.810]  Oh, we were at
[59:40.270 --> 59:41.730]  501 meters at 5-0-1.
[59:41.890 --> 59:42.710]  Is that true?
[59:44.310 --> 59:46.370]  Someone in chat said we were at 501
[59:46.370 --> 59:47.850]  meters at 5-0-1. We were.
[59:48.690 --> 59:50.210]  I thought that's what you were talking about.
[59:50.370 --> 59:51.310]  I didn't even see the time.
[59:51.890 --> 59:52.510]  I just saw the height.
[59:54.230 --> 59:54.630]  Ready?
[59:54.630 --> 59:55.330]  On.
[59:56.070 --> 59:57.050]  And let's go.
[59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.770]  This is just an easy
[01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:01.110]  jump.
[01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:03.490]  This is just an easy jump.
[01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.450]  Okay, so.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.110]  When I said that, what I meant was
[01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:12.390]  just make the easy jump. I apologize
[01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:13.670]  if that was confusing.
[01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.630]  Alright.
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:17.010]  Back in the hole.
[01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:19.770]  I guess...
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.430]  I guess I thought
[01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:23.110]  it was clear.
[01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:25.650]  Are we going the wrong way?
[01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:27.650]  It was not me.
[01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:30.430]  I think it was
[01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.750]  Gavin.
[01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:34.610]  No, I think this is the right way.
[01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:36.630]  This is the
[01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:37.010]  right way.
[01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:38.230]  We're good.
[01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:42.510]  Gavin, you hold it together funny.
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.530]  Let me be perfectly honest with you.
[01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.430]  I don't even remember what happened
[01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:47.190]  and what we were on.
[01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:49.770]  What did I just mess up?
[01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.010]  We had to pass
[01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.810]  a beam.
[01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.590]  Oh, I do remember that. It was definitely me.
[01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.790]  It was absolutely me.
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.250]  I sucked on that one.
[01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.050]  Eric said it was easy and then I just...
[01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:03.430]  It wasn't really too easy.
[01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.990]  Too easy.
[01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.790]  We don't have to open the door again. That's great.
[01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:11.890]  Do you need to open that
[01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:12.210]  window?
[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.650]  Are you alright?
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.450]  Alright, well.
[01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.150]  So, Gavin,
[01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:21.650]  just out of curiosity, what was the plan?
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:24.890]  Just like,
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:26.590]  what was going through your head?
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.790]  You're just like, I'm going for it?
[01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:31.150]  Go, go, go.
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:35.110]  I'm getting loopy.
[01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:35.750]  I'm getting dusky.
[01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.250]  Go, go, go.
[01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:40.210]  No, no!
[01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.450]  Well, that was...
[01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.570]  Gavin, that was absolutely
[01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:46.730]  the right move. You did
[01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.450]  very good. You did
[01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.670]  so good there, Gavin. I can't give you enough credit
[01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:52.930]  for that. That was such quick thinking.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.190]  I knew I had to say it and I had to jump off.
[01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:57.010]  No, that was great. That was very smart.
[01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.930]  You were absolutely right to jump. Well done.
[01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:04.050]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:06.670]  We have the slack. It's fine.
[01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.130]  Yeah, we have the slack and also
[01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.850]  if you can time it, you can time it.
[01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:11.530]  There you go.
[01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:14.550]  Next one.
[01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:16.190]  It's the slow-moving
[01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:18.590]  jump that I'm bolloxing
[01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.590]  up. Yeah, it's scary.
[01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.550]  I get it.
[01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.210]  It's just total silence.
[01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.310]  Gavin, lock it in.
[01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:38.710]  Alright, ready? Here we go.
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:41.470]  There we go. Alright. This is it.
[01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:42.190]  Here it comes.
[01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.170]  Good job.
[01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:51.350]  Get on this one.
[01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.090]  There we go. Great work.
[01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:57.130]  This one coming around.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.130]  Here it comes. You ready? Yep. Here we go.
[01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:00.290]  And let's go.
[01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:01.690]  Great work.
[01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.050]  Where is the
[01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.350]  freaking second one? I appreciate everyone
[01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:09.970]  cheering me on.
[01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:13.230]  Hang on. Not yet.
[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.210]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.190]  Here we go.
[01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:18.730]  Nice and easy.
[01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:19.610]  Big sticks.
[01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.690]  Now, this has been the point of
[01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:23.730]  contention in the past.
[01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.670]  Yes, we fell here the first
[01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.590]  few times. Now, how do we do this?
[01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.950]  Are we all going at the same time?
[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:32.610]  And do we land and walk
[01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:33.070]  to the end?
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.110]  I think so.
[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.490]  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
[01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:39.510]  I don't want to hear, I think so.
[01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:42.010]  That's what we're doing, right? We're
[01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:44.590]  landing, stopping, and then walking to the end.
[01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:45.290]  That is the plan.
[01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.510]  Got it.
[01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.910]  I'm making sure.
[01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:50.510]  What are the other options?
[01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:52.930]  I didn't move.
[01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:54.090]  I didn't move.
[01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:56.950]  Did not move.
[01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.270]  I need to try and get back to the platform.
[01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:00.490]  Walk back. Walk back.
[01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.890]  Me and you, Gavin.
[01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:05.130]  Oh, Gavin. Get on the top.
[01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.850]  Get on the top.
[01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.150]  The top's worse!
[01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:11.190]  No, it's not. That's where you need to be.
[01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.850]  Keep pulling me.
[01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:15.470]  Good job.
[01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.250]  There we go.
[01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:20.710]  That's all you have to do.
[01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.010]  Okay.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.390]  Andrew, what happened?
[01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:25.970]  Great work.
[01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.370]  I didn't touch anything.
[01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:30.150]  I know.
[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:32.150]  I didn't touch anything.
[01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.530]  So let's just group up.
[01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:36.510]  I'm going to count down.
[01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:39.310]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.170]  Good. Nice and easy.
[01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.490]  Hang on. Hang on.
[01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.110]  We all ready?
[01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.970]  Yep.
[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.690]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:53.650]  Sausages.
[01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:54.870]  Nice and easy.
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:58.590]  I'm coming. I'm just slowly going.
[01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:59.210]  No, you're good.
[01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:01.010]  Gavin, watch it.
[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:04.610]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:09.070]  Look at that. Like a big slug.
[01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.550]  This is the furthest we've ever made it.
[01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.910]  Ever in the whole game?
[01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.450]  Yes. Let's slow down here.
[01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.310]  Let's look at what we're about to do.
[01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:20.350]  Okay.
[01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:22.990]  Okay.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.550]  We need to make...
[01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:27.390]  this jump.
[01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:29.750]  I think we just have to
[01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.710]  land and take our time and have Andrew
[01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:32.470]  keep calling it out.
[01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.490]  I'm at this arrow. You take that back.
[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:37.350]  Okay.
[01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:42.030]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.810]  Beautiful. Good job.
[01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.950]  Gavin, move up a little bit.
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.770]  Gavin, you're so far away.
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.530]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:55.990]  Okay.
[01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:57.770]  You're okay.
[01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:00.390]  This barrel is smaller.
[01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:03.290]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:07.070]  Good. Gavin, hang on.
[01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:09.550]  I've...
[01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:10.950]  It's okay. You're okay.
[01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:12.230]  You're all good.
[01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.950]  Whatever you're going to say, Gavin,
[01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.510]  hold it until we get to the stopwatch.
[01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:20.250]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:22.310]  Okay.
[01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.430]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.430]  Good. Okay.
[01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.650]  What's happening with this?
[01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:33.690]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:37.090]  Okay.
[01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:39.130]  3, 2,
[01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:40.650]  1, go.
[01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:42.090]  Good.
[01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:45.550]  3, 2, 1,
[01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.350]  go.
[01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.250]  I messed it up.
[01:06:48.490 --> 01:06:51.510]  Gavin, I need you to not
[01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:53.490]  say anything until we get to
[01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:54.790]  the next solid landing.
[01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.250]  Not the jumps. Not the little things.
[01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.110]  I just gotta hold it together
[01:06:59.110 --> 01:06:59.930]  until you get to that.
[01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:03.890]  You run in a circle. Do whatever you want.
[01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.350]  But right now, you just gotta hold it together.
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:07.670]  Make these last few jumps.
[01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.810]  You just keep it in. That's all you gotta do, man.
[01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:11.970]  I believe in you. I believe in you, Gavin.
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:13.890]  I believe in you.
[01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.330]  I believe in you. I believe in you.
[01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:16.490]  Alright, Andrew, all you.
[01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.050]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:20.350]  Good.
[01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:23.570]  3, 2, 1,
[01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:24.230]  go.
[01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:27.690]  3, 2,
[01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.270]  1, go.
[01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.910]  Ugh.
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:33.230]  Alright, Gavin.
[01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.410]  You say whatever you want. You go insane mode.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.150]  You run around in circles. You go insane. You go
[01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:39.170]  fucking crazy. Whatever you want.
[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:41.310]  Whatever you want right now. How are
[01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:41.850]  you feeling?
[01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.150]  What's your life like at this moment?
[01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.230]  Well, I got distracted by two things.
[01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:50.570]  Andrew was making me laugh.
[01:07:51.350 --> 01:07:51.670]  What?
[01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:54.990]  And someone in chat who misses
[01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.030]  Geoff said,
[01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.090]  An egg just isn't the
[01:07:58.090 --> 01:07:59.930]  same, but I would like to think about
[01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.890]  how soon it sounds exactly
[01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:02.510]  the same.
[01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:06.170]  Oh, thank god
[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.850]  you didn't say that.
[01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.290]  Oh, man.
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:10.650]  I agree, though. I agree.
[01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:13.610]  Alright, so...
[01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:14.930]  Now, it looks like
[01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.470]  we make this walk up
[01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.950]  and then go to the cross?
[01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:21.770]  Is that the...
[01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:22.430]  Let's take a look.
[01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.410]  Yep.
[01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:26.430]  Let's all get up here and, Andrew, you can call it off.
[01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:27.590]  We're all going to just jump to the cross.
[01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:28.950]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:31.630]  Cool. Good.
[01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:33.410]  Go ahead and call it off again.
[01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.690]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.630]  Great. You're doing great, Andrew.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.490]  3, 2, 1,
[01:08:40.570 --> 01:08:40.970]  go.
[01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:44.410]  Where is the bloody checkpoint?
[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:46.430]  Stop. Hold it. If you've got
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.210]  something to say, hold it in until we're on
[01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:49.430]  solid ground. Just wait.
[01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:50.990]  Can I just say, Eric?
[01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.670]  Yeah. There's a little lip there.
[01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.010]  3, 2, 1, go.
[01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:56.990]  Great. Great.
[01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:57.950]  Nice.
[01:08:58.790 --> 01:08:59.910]  Is this the checkpoint?
[01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.770]  Is that a checkpoint?
[01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.650]  Hello? Are you a checkpoint?
[01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.390]  Can you give me a
[01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.330]  checkpoint from these hands, please?
[01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:10.870]  It's not a checkpoint.
[01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:13.550]  9 meters
[01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.330]  we get the checkpoint.
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:16.730]  That's what the chat said.
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.590]  The 9 worst meters
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.330]  of my life. This is gonna be nice and easy.
[01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:22.890]  Little jump. There we go.
[01:09:23.190 --> 01:09:24.430]  Nice little walk. Nice and slow.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.950]  I'm doing little shuffle shimmies.
[01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.350]  No, no. You're doing great. You're doing great, Gavin.
[01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:30.450]  Nick. Nick.
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.950]  Nick. I'm here.
[01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.670]  You're way too far up for the guy who's supposed
[01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.610]  to be in the back.
[01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.150]  I'm here. I'm moving.
[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:44.590]  Doing great. You're doing great, Gavin.
[01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:45.850]  Got the little
[01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:48.450]  stick. Slow down. Slow down a little bit.
[01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:49.590]  Nick's a little behind.
[01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.590]  Okay. I was told to slow down.
[01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:54.370]  Yeah, when you were second
[01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:55.630]  I'm supposed to be fourth.
[01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.470]  No fighting on the log!
[01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.610]  Yeah, I mean
[01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:02.230]  as long as there's slack, you're fine to be wherever.
[01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:04.250]  Yeah, let's just make sure we have slack.
[01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.590]  Okay, we're gonna...
[01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.650]  Oh, this is terrifying.
[01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:12.730]  How long is this
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:15.170]  stick? It's the longest...
[01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.690]  You're fine. Just hold it until we get there.
[01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:18.170]  Just hold it until we get there.
[01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:20.690]  We're almost there. Doing great.
[01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:21.430]  Doing great.
[01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.510]  Meeting myself on a road trip.
[01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:30.590]  Doing fantastic. Thank you everyone watching
[01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:32.630]  live on Twitch. If you're watching the VOD,
[01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:34.550]  also thank you.
[01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:38.730]  I imagine you fast-forwarded through so much of this
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:40.690]  video if you're watching on the VOD. Thank you so much
[01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:41.350]  for doing that.
[01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:44.150]  Guys, we're almost there.
[01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:46.250]  Almost there. Nice and easy.
[01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:47.670]  Is this a checkpoint?
[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.310]  The Aquamaze.
[01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:52.990]  What is the Aquamaze?
[01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:54.370]  Woo! Be careful.
[01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:56.830]  Sounds like it's water. Is that drowning?
[01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:58.090]  I don't know.
[01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:00.130]  I hope not.
[01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.610]  Oh, wow. What? Okay, Gavin, you're
[01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:04.910]  leading us. You just keep
[01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:05.510]  going left, right?
[01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:08.130]  That is the way to deal with a maze.
[01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:10.590]  Nope.
[01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:11.810]  Oh, no.
[01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:13.110]  Now we go over here.
[01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.690]  There's an up section right here.
[01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:18.270]  I'll be honest, the ups and downs
[01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.970]  are really throwing me.
[01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.090]  Making you sick? Yep.
[01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:23.750]  Alright, Gavin, we're with you.
[01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:25.770]  Are you? Yep.
[01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.170]  Right here. I mean, we don't really have a choice, but
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:28.370]  yep.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.960]  Is this the way we came in?
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.280]  No. I don't think so.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.420]  I don't think so.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:37.860]  No.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.580]  Waterfall hole?
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.960]  No! No! No!
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.880]  Oh, God. No!
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.140]  No! No!
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.640]  No! No!
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.020]  I'm swimming! I'm swimming!
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.380]  I'm doing what I can!
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.680]  Go left.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.340]  Guys, I want to thank you so much for watching
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.900]  this. I really appreciate it.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.560]  Did we get a checkpoint?
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:00.540]  No.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.160]  No, absolutely not. Thank you guys so much
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.240]  for... Why did they tell us to play with checkpoints
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.800]  when we never fucking hit one? What the fuck?
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.120]  Thank you guys so much for watching
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.420]  this stream. This has been so much fun. Next time,
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.000]  can we get to
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.620]  the checkpoint? No.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.060]  We'll have to watch and find out, guys.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.700]  Every Friday at 4pm,
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.940]  we're doing this until we win. I can feel it.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.080]  And the next time, we're making it all the way,
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.220]  baby. Spin the
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.360]  wheel and join us next week to see
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.220]  who will be
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.320]  playing this game in
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.560]  hell, in the hell game.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.180]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.120]  Any final thoughts for the folks at home, guys?
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.220]  Thanks for watching. I'm sorry. I love you.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:41.880]  Have a good weekend.
