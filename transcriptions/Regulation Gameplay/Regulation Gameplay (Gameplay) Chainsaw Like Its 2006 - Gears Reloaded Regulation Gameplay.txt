[00:00.000 --> 00:03.180]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay.
[00:03.440 --> 00:07.560]  First of all, I would like to say thank you to Xbox for sending us Gears of War Reloaded.
[00:08.280 --> 00:09.520]  We're playing a little bit early.
[00:10.120 --> 00:12.960]  We're playing Gears of War 1 early in 2025.
[00:13.320 --> 00:14.480]  Gears of War 1 early in the future.
[00:14.680 --> 00:18.460]  Now, remember these walls, Gavin, because Gears of War E-Day is the next game
[00:18.460 --> 00:22.380]  and I assume that game will end with us being put in here.
[00:22.500 --> 00:24.020]  Because it is a prequel to this.
[00:24.580 --> 00:25.200]  We're playing Gears...
[00:25.200 --> 00:27.820]  Why don't we just pretend we've just played all of that on Insane.
[00:27.820 --> 00:32.360]  Woah, man, can you believe that scene?
[00:32.400 --> 00:33.020]  Did you see that bit?
[00:33.360 --> 00:38.040]  Oh my god, when you had the lancers attached to your kneecaps
[00:38.040 --> 00:40.640]  and you were killing people with chains on...
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.880]  Isn't it weird?
[00:42.240 --> 00:46.440]  All of those guns that we had, but a lot of them just vanished out of existence now.
[00:46.520 --> 00:48.100]  We don't have them anymore. That's crazy.
[00:48.500 --> 00:51.900]  When you went like, bam, ba-bam, boo-boo-boo, boo-boo.
[00:52.040 --> 00:52.600]  Ah, dude.
[00:53.580 --> 00:54.020]  Inspiring.
[00:54.540 --> 00:56.300]  Now I'm in jail because we did that too much.
[00:56.300 --> 00:56.980]  Woah!
[00:57.580 --> 00:58.940]  You pulled us forward.
[00:59.880 --> 01:03.120]  So we played through all of Gears of War 5 on the hardest difficulty.
[01:03.380 --> 01:05.820]  We are now going to do the same for this game.
[01:06.580 --> 01:07.900]  Combat. We don't need training.
[01:08.220 --> 01:09.120]  Get rid of that.
[01:09.580 --> 01:11.480]  We're experts. We just did five.
[01:12.500 --> 01:15.080]  When we did five on the hardest difficulty, it was what?
[01:15.420 --> 01:16.920]  18? 18 parts?
[01:17.880 --> 01:20.000]  I'm curious how long this one will be.
[01:20.140 --> 01:20.660]  At least.
[01:20.980 --> 01:21.820]  Oh, Cogtax.
[01:22.280 --> 01:25.160]  Oh, I forgot about the...
[01:25.160 --> 01:27.140]  Dude, they're so much easier to see now.
[01:27.400 --> 01:27.720]  Good.
[01:27.860 --> 01:32.600]  Remember back in like 2006 or whatever, this game just looked murky.
[01:32.740 --> 01:33.780]  Just like mud.
[01:34.620 --> 01:39.180]  It was very mucky, and I think the greatest compliment I can give this game,
[01:39.240 --> 01:41.000]  as well as any game that's like a remaster,
[01:41.600 --> 01:44.240]  is it looks the way you remember it looking.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.220]  Like, this looks great.
[01:46.440 --> 01:49.960]  It looks like I remember how it looked in my head outside of the murkiness of like,
[01:49.980 --> 01:50.880]  oh yeah, this looks good.
[01:51.180 --> 01:54.680]  If you go back at that 360 version, it is looking rough.
[01:55.200 --> 01:55.640]  Yeah.
[01:55.720 --> 01:57.720]  And it's like, you can see the pixels.
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.100]  It's like, how do we not remember?
[01:59.500 --> 02:01.820]  How is our memory not in pixels?
[02:02.240 --> 02:06.740]  Actually, let me turn off, because I get dizzy now.
[02:06.880 --> 02:08.060]  I'm an old man now.
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.260]  I need the camera shake off.
[02:09.320 --> 02:09.920]  It is off already.
[02:10.020 --> 02:10.460]  Okay, good.
[02:10.780 --> 02:11.000]  Sweet.
[02:11.240 --> 02:11.860]  When does it shake?
[02:11.900 --> 02:12.320]  When you run?
[02:12.880 --> 02:13.660]  Yeah, when you hold A.
[02:14.240 --> 02:16.600]  Oh, yeah, that's pretty vom-inducing.
[02:18.180 --> 02:21.420]  I didn't notice it when I was younger, but when I was replaying it.
[02:21.920 --> 02:22.600]  Let's go through here.
[02:22.980 --> 02:23.400]  Whoa!
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.080]  You think his lower half is on the left?
[02:27.540 --> 02:29.040]  You think that's his lower half?
[02:30.080 --> 02:30.780]  Oh, like...
[02:30.780 --> 02:31.400]  How many people?
[02:31.480 --> 02:33.300]  Do you think this is three people or two people?
[02:33.880 --> 02:34.480]  Let's see.
[02:34.540 --> 02:35.800]  Is this a penis on this guy?
[02:36.700 --> 02:36.900]  Oh.
[02:37.460 --> 02:40.260]  His penis seems to be gone.
[02:40.260 --> 02:40.940]  Oh, it's gone.
[02:41.580 --> 02:42.640]  So it could be a lady.
[02:42.640 --> 02:45.480]  Isn't it funny that that's like the...
[02:46.140 --> 02:47.980]  that's the too much of this?
[02:48.980 --> 02:52.740]  Like, from an ESRB standpoint, I assume that would be where the line is drawn,
[02:52.740 --> 02:53.880]  compared to what is...
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.660]  It's like, this is fine, but...
[02:55.660 --> 02:57.720]  Yeah, you can show the brutality, but a penis?
[02:58.080 --> 02:58.760]  Absolutely not.
[02:59.100 --> 03:02.600]  Okay, are you ready for the first gunfight we're going to have?
[03:02.660 --> 03:05.880]  Because we're going to walk in here, and if I remember correctly, things get hot immediately.
[03:06.520 --> 03:07.340]  Yes, I'm ready.
[03:07.500 --> 03:08.160]  Let's do it.
[03:08.660 --> 03:09.680]  Let's see who dies first.
[03:09.720 --> 03:10.400]  Not going to be me.
[03:11.060 --> 03:11.640]  Not going to be me.
[03:11.900 --> 03:14.300]  I don't die for another three games, so I'm good.
[03:14.300 --> 03:15.220]  Ha ha ha!
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.440]  It's cool that with this release, it's coming out on PlayStation as well.
[03:25.200 --> 03:25.960]  And it'd be such a...
[03:25.960 --> 03:29.220]  Like, could you imagine playing this for the first time in the year 2025?
[03:30.100 --> 03:30.440]  Whoa!
[03:31.000 --> 03:31.440]  Ow!
[03:31.440 --> 03:31.780]  Okay.
[03:33.760 --> 03:35.040]  That was not your fault.
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.180]  He, like, teleported through the barrier.
[03:37.400 --> 03:37.720]  I got you.
[03:37.800 --> 03:39.020]  Yeah, I was...
[03:39.020 --> 03:40.660]  Oh, you can...
[03:40.660 --> 03:41.800]  Are we on insane?
[03:43.320 --> 03:44.380]  Yeah, I believe so.
[03:44.660 --> 03:45.060]  Are we not?
[03:46.400 --> 03:47.100]  How do we check?
[03:48.340 --> 03:50.520]  Well, you would remember what you set it to, surely?
[03:50.620 --> 03:52.100]  I mean, I set it to insane.
[03:54.420 --> 03:55.980]  I feel like we're in insane mode.
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.240]  I remember back in the day, you had to unlock insane by playing hardcore.
[04:00.580 --> 04:04.980]  Yeah, but I feel like since this is, like, the remaster type thing...
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.940]  Like, no one wants to play it twice again.
[04:07.440 --> 04:07.800]  Yeah.
[04:09.740 --> 04:11.000]  I feel like this is insane.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.160]  Man, I got chewed up pretty good.
[04:13.240 --> 04:16.580]  I'm a very persuadable person that I did the wrong thing.
[04:17.600 --> 04:26.420]  Like, I know I clicked insane, I know I selected it, but if you question it, you can convince me so easily that I somehow screwed things up in a general sense.
[04:27.160 --> 04:27.480]  Whoa!
[04:28.800 --> 04:38.000]  Oh, I wonder if this has the same achievements, because I remember on the original Gears of War, I got the five back-to-back reloads achievement before I got the 25 total...
[04:38.700 --> 04:39.680]  Oh, that's funny.
[04:39.680 --> 04:41.780]  ...perfect reloads, so I'm gonna try and do that again.
[04:43.220 --> 04:43.800]  That's one.
[04:49.260 --> 04:49.860]  That's two.
[04:52.140 --> 04:53.200]  Got the window guy.
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.260]  Oh my god, he's... nice.
[04:56.400 --> 04:56.680]  That's three!
[04:57.900 --> 05:00.060]  Okay, I just did three in a row, I think.
[05:03.980 --> 05:04.560]  That's four!
[05:04.640 --> 05:05.440]  Oh, fuck.
[05:05.580 --> 05:07.180]  I got it! I got the achievement!
[05:07.780 --> 05:08.560]  Oh, you did? Nice!
[05:08.560 --> 05:09.620]  Part two before part one!
[05:11.160 --> 05:13.440]  Oh, fuck. Okay, uh... uh...
[05:14.240 --> 05:15.900]  How did I remember that, though?
[05:16.140 --> 05:17.800]  By me, I'm running back. I'm getting this cocktail.
[05:17.840 --> 05:20.020]  I'm ready for them at this frickin' door right here.
[05:22.260 --> 05:27.880]  I forget so much useful stuff, but I remember which order I got an achievement 20 years ago.
[05:29.180 --> 05:30.000]  Oh, achievement!
[05:31.300 --> 05:31.920]  You got it?
[05:32.480 --> 05:32.820]  Yeah!
[05:36.660 --> 05:37.760]  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
[05:42.680 --> 05:43.860]  Are you getting ammo?
[05:44.940 --> 05:46.180]  I'm gonna do a little scan.
[05:46.180 --> 05:49.080]  If you wanna come back to where I'm at, there is a cocktail back here.
[05:49.680 --> 05:51.080]  Don't we both get it if you get it?
[05:51.140 --> 05:52.480]  Oh, this game is good.
[05:52.980 --> 05:53.820]  Is that how it works?
[05:54.620 --> 05:55.320]  Pretty sure it is.
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.620]  Okay, well, awesome.
[05:56.720 --> 05:58.180]  Well, where is it? Do you see it still?
[05:58.700 --> 06:02.560]  Uh, I don't see it anymore. It's over by me, right here. It was on the floor at my feet.
[06:03.300 --> 06:03.700]  Do you see it?
[06:04.820 --> 06:06.140]  I don't see nothin'.
[06:06.140 --> 06:06.740]  Okay, perfect.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.900]  One of us gets it, the other does.
[06:11.180 --> 06:11.940]  I'm so happy.
[06:11.940 --> 06:15.060]  I love these games. I love the Gears of War franchise.
[06:16.120 --> 06:19.700]  This game changed the look of games for like...
[06:19.700 --> 06:20.900]  Oh! Another achievement.
[06:22.000 --> 06:22.520]  Another achievement.
[06:24.160 --> 06:28.680]  Every game after this game came out looked like this game for like six years.
[06:29.680 --> 06:32.100]  I mean, there are worse games you could try to copy the look of.
[06:36.450 --> 06:40.510]  I just remember how iconic the Madworld trailer was for this thing.
[06:40.990 --> 06:41.370]  Yeah.
[06:42.750 --> 06:43.990]  Was that for the first game?
[06:44.650 --> 06:44.970]  Yes.
[06:49.790 --> 06:56.450]  Like, if we were to do a video game trailer draft, that would be in my first three.
[06:58.370 --> 07:01.690]  Yeah, I'd probably stick that in. I'd probably also stick in that...
[07:01.690 --> 07:04.190]  Uh, everybody wants to rule the world Assassin's Creed trailer.
[07:05.090 --> 07:07.250]  Oh, I don't know. Like, that doesn't come to mind for me.
[07:08.410 --> 07:10.970]  I think that game was dogshit, but I remember liking the trailer.
[07:14.050 --> 07:14.490]  Yeah.
[07:14.490 --> 07:19.530]  It is funny that some of the best game trailers I think of are not necessarily reflective of the game.
[07:20.270 --> 07:26.130]  Like, I feel like Madworld captures the sort of fear and character design well of this universe.
[07:27.370 --> 07:36.030]  But, like, the Dead Island trailer is fantastic, but does not at all accurately convey the tone or experience of what that game ended up being.
[07:38.470 --> 07:39.410]  I never played that game.
[07:40.330 --> 07:47.130]  It's fun, but it's like the trailer was this incredibly emotional, dark thing.
[07:48.010 --> 07:53.390]  And then you play the game and there's a character in it who's a rapper with a hit single that is,
[07:53.510 --> 07:54.570]  Who do you voodoo, bitch?
[07:55.070 --> 07:59.310]  This is not what it was presented as.
[08:01.210 --> 08:06.730]  Oh, I think Madworld actually made it into the game, right? Eventually it was like in Gears 3.
[08:07.210 --> 08:08.210]  I think so, yeah.
[08:09.410 --> 08:09.990]  So was Ice-T.
[08:10.870 --> 08:14.090]  Ice-T and Madworld both finally made it.
[08:15.230 --> 08:19.630]  Complete Chapter 1 Co-op is a .02 achievement.
[08:19.630 --> 08:20.850]  Well, the game's not out yet.
[08:21.390 --> 08:26.810]  It might be the rarest I've ever seen, and I think every achievement is going to be ultra, ultra rare for us.
[08:27.230 --> 08:28.650]  Oh, it's going to just boost our stats.
[08:29.150 --> 08:30.070]  I want to get a .01.
[08:33.230 --> 08:34.310]  Or was it .1?
[08:43.070 --> 08:46.510]  What if that was the twist in the remaster is that you weren't Marcus Fenix?
[08:47.670 --> 08:49.330]  He just gets killed right here.
[08:49.490 --> 08:50.170]  Just an imposter.
[08:54.020 --> 08:55.500]  Man, it looks so much better.
[08:59.620 --> 09:04.380]  Because the original Gears of War had like a, like a blown out look.
[09:04.940 --> 09:05.420]  Sure.
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.780]  It was like very gloomy and hot spots everywhere.
[09:10.120 --> 09:10.400]  Yeah.
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.320]  Which was also like a, an oblivion era sort of look to games.
[09:21.060 --> 09:24.000]  Do you know if they've announced a show or like move?
[09:24.120 --> 09:24.640]  Oh, fuck.
[09:24.880 --> 09:25.740]  Oh, shit!
[09:30.440 --> 09:31.680]  A Gears show?
[09:32.060 --> 09:38.780]  Yeah, because I feel like I'm always hearing, like there were rumors for years, a long time ago, that Batista was going to play Marcus Fenix in like a movie.
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.600]  And it just, it feels like a universe that would convert so well into like a TV show.
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.900]  Maybe the Gears show should be the one time they hire all the voice actors to play the roles.
[09:57.570 --> 09:59.210]  They should just go the other way with it.
[09:59.270 --> 10:04.030]  I wonder if any of the voice actors are as large as the characters they portray.
[10:08.270 --> 10:09.210]  I don't think I know.
[10:09.290 --> 10:11.930]  Well, I know Baird is Bender, right?
[10:13.290 --> 10:14.890]  I thought Marcus was Bender.
[10:15.310 --> 10:15.630]  Is he?
[10:16.510 --> 10:17.310]  See, I don't know.
[10:17.310 --> 10:19.570]  I don't know a lot of other voice actors for these games.
[10:20.350 --> 10:21.510]  Outside of Ice-T, obviously.
[10:25.150 --> 10:25.910]  We're screwed.
[10:33.630 --> 10:40.150]  It'd be interesting to go back and look and see the detailing of did she have blood splatter like that on her?
[10:40.210 --> 10:45.030]  Like I just can't, I can't imagine that looking good on 360 for what it is.
[10:45.030 --> 10:47.010]  Yeah, I mean maybe you just could barely make it out.
[10:47.770 --> 10:53.310]  Because it would have been like 720p or maybe like 720i or something.
[10:55.310 --> 10:58.390]  I mean, I don't think... was HDMI part of the...
[10:59.070 --> 11:02.630]  Wasn't there like a weird converter thing with the first 360 that came out?
[11:03.170 --> 11:04.950]  The original 360 wasn't HDMI.
[11:05.590 --> 11:09.250]  It was component, but then the Elite added HDMI.
[11:09.690 --> 11:13.290]  So it's still like 360 era, but...
[11:13.290 --> 11:17.310]  I remember I played, I played all of the early 360 stuff on a monitor.
[11:17.590 --> 11:18.930]  I had like the VGA adapter.
[11:20.130 --> 11:20.810]  Oh, wow.
[11:27.450 --> 11:27.970]  Cog tag.
[11:30.670 --> 11:31.370]  I want it.
[11:32.150 --> 11:32.770]  Get away, enemies!
[11:33.690 --> 11:34.340]  I feel like the...
[11:36.390 --> 11:40.110]  The Omen, what's the thing called? Crimson Omen thing. It's like so much brighter than it used to be.
[11:40.530 --> 11:40.810]  Yeah.
[11:40.930 --> 11:42.150]  You can see it from like across the map.
[11:46.340 --> 11:48.660]  Before there was yellow paint, there was red paint.
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.300]  I wonder who put that like within the in-world lore.
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.120]  Have they ever explained who's the person putting all these symbols down?
[12:04.160 --> 12:07.460]  It's like a Banksy of the Gears universe.
[12:08.300 --> 12:10.800]  Has anyone got Banksy to do something in a game yet?
[12:11.580 --> 12:12.440]  I don't know.
[12:13.480 --> 12:14.280]  It'd be funny to...
[12:15.380 --> 12:17.220]  Well, I think we know who he is.
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.140]  I'm sure we do.
[12:19.660 --> 12:20.780]  He's not like Batman.
[12:21.360 --> 12:22.480]  That information's out there.
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.140]  I think it'd be cool to add a Banksy to just one person's copy of a game and see if they notice it.
[12:30.940 --> 12:32.240]  I don't think they would.
[12:35.580 --> 12:36.620]  There was...
[12:37.700 --> 12:42.280]  Hanes is an American underwear company that is partnered with Michael Jordan.
[12:42.280 --> 12:49.180]  And they did a run where if you bought a pack of underwear, it came with like a little pack of cards.
[12:49.940 --> 12:54.600]  And he signed like 10 cards that were distributed amongst the packs.
[12:54.980 --> 12:58.220]  And I don't think anyone has ever encountered one of those autographs.
[12:58.460 --> 13:04.080]  So I assume it just went to people that just wanted underwear and didn't give a fuck about their trading cards.
[13:04.640 --> 13:11.840]  So I imagine if it was like two games with Banksy doing something with it, just nobody...
[13:11.840 --> 13:12.900]  Nobody would know.
[13:15.940 --> 13:24.240]  Unless you publicized it and then people would ruin it by like just buying countless copies of the game and not playing it or just like getting rid of them.
[13:27.140 --> 13:33.440]  Like I don't know if you saw, but there was a Pokemon collaboration with McDonald's Japan.
[13:33.940 --> 13:40.960]  It was supposed to go three days, but they had to cancel after one with their Happy Meals.
[13:40.960 --> 13:48.400]  And people were just buying the Happy Meals and throwing the food away to the point where they were like, we can't keep doing this.
[13:49.020 --> 13:50.360]  We just gotta end this promo.
[13:52.540 --> 13:53.200]  That's horrific.
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.420]  Is Gears of War the first game that you played that you slid to a wall that you'd like snap to it like this?
[14:01.500 --> 14:02.340]  Oh, it must have been.
[14:02.660 --> 14:06.780]  I can't think of... It's like something I expect out of third person shooters now.
[14:07.040 --> 14:09.400]  And I don't think I experienced it before this.
[14:09.400 --> 14:14.160]  Because the cover system in this was like one of the selling points, I think.
[14:14.680 --> 14:15.900]  Oh, it feels great.
[14:21.480 --> 14:27.080]  I didn't get my 360 until a little bit later into its life cycle.
[14:27.300 --> 14:29.380]  And by that, I mean probably like a year after it came out.
[14:29.680 --> 14:32.520]  And I don't think I played Gears until a little while after it came out.
[14:32.520 --> 14:42.840]  It was definitely a... rented it at Blockbuster and then spent all three of the days I had with it playing nonstop and just having so much fun going through the campaign.
[14:44.600 --> 14:46.020]  Yeah, I think I bought it.
[14:46.800 --> 14:48.860]  Because this was probably around the time I started working.
[14:49.500 --> 14:57.440]  It was a definite initial rental and then I bought it and there was nothing more rage inducing for me than the multiplayer in this game.
[14:57.780 --> 15:00.340]  Probably the angriest I've ever been playing any game.
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.060]  I would get so mad as a kid.
[15:02.520 --> 15:03.740]  Did you take a hate nap?
[15:05.040 --> 15:06.120]  No, I didn't.
[15:06.380 --> 15:09.320]  I was so young that I hadn't come up with the hate nap yet.
[15:09.520 --> 15:21.500]  I would just... I would just quietly be seething in my chair or I'd just get up and like, I don't know, like flex at my chair, like pretend I was going to hit my chair or something.
[15:21.720 --> 15:24.960]  I was never someone who'd punch anything or would like throw my controller.
[15:26.660 --> 15:29.340]  But... oh boy, did I get close in this game.
[15:31.880 --> 15:37.320]  Trying to get the seriously... that's maybe my biggest gaming regret is I don't have the seriously achievement when I should.
[15:38.400 --> 15:45.620]  Because I got Xbox Live as a birthday gift from my grandparents and then they stopped paying it.
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.660]  And I didn't understand... when it said like your account was no longer around anymore, like couldn't be used, I thought it was like banned.
[15:52.820 --> 15:55.100]  So I just made a new account with somebody else's card.
[15:55.100 --> 15:56.480]  Oh my god, really?
[15:56.480 --> 16:02.060]  Yeah, so I had like 70,000 kills, I think at that point.
[16:02.220 --> 16:03.340]  Oh my god, Andrew.
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.680]  And then I just started over and I think I'm back to like 80,000 on my main account.
[16:10.140 --> 16:12.980]  It'd be cool if you could carry them between versions of the game.
[16:13.380 --> 16:14.320]  Oh, that'd be amazing.
[16:14.440 --> 16:17.040]  Like if it counted my... I don't know how close I got. Are you down?
[16:17.340 --> 16:19.180]  I'm down. Yeah, I need assistance.
[16:19.980 --> 16:21.980]  You didn't sound very down in the way you were speaking.
[16:22.360 --> 16:25.480]  No, I was just, you know, wrapped up thinking about my Seriously.
[16:26.700 --> 16:27.340]  Thank you.
[16:27.780 --> 16:31.620]  Kim's down too. Can Kim die? Do we need to like rush? I can't let him get him.
[16:32.040 --> 16:33.920]  No, okay. You got picked up when you killed that guy.
[16:34.700 --> 16:35.020]  Yeah, the last...
[16:35.020 --> 16:35.780]  Did you get a chainsaw kill?
[16:36.480 --> 16:36.800]  Yeah.
[16:37.320 --> 16:37.640]  Nice.
[16:37.860 --> 16:38.880]  Well, I'm trying to get all the achievements.
[16:42.740 --> 16:45.620]  I need to see if... Seriously has to be in here, right?
[16:47.180 --> 16:48.880]  Oh, I mean, why wouldn't it be?
[16:48.880 --> 16:50.040]  I think...
[16:50.040 --> 16:52.100]  Zen in the art of reloading, part two.
[16:52.800 --> 16:53.520]  You think they made it easier?
[16:53.780 --> 16:55.960]  Grenade. Come on, make it in the hole.
[16:56.840 --> 16:57.600]  Oh, what a grenade.
[17:00.180 --> 17:00.980]  That was great.
[17:01.840 --> 17:02.420]  Cog tag.
[17:04.020 --> 17:08.120]  I mean, you kind of joke. There is part of me that does want to try to get every achievement in this thing.
[17:08.940 --> 17:13.480]  What if I finished playing this game with the exact achievements I originally got and that was it?
[17:18.880 --> 17:22.460]  I wonder how many did you get? Because there were DLC achievements too.
[17:23.200 --> 17:24.000]  Some of those were tricky.
[17:24.720 --> 17:26.020]  There was DLC for Gears of War?
[17:26.380 --> 17:27.980]  Yeah, there was some multiplayer DLC.
[17:29.240 --> 17:34.720]  I remember the only frustrating part of this game for me was when you're in the minecarts with the Lambent wretches.
[17:35.680 --> 17:37.480]  I don't really remember the minecarts.
[17:38.240 --> 17:41.660]  It's because you can't get picked up, so you both had to make it through.
[17:44.340 --> 17:54.100]  I remember there's a sequence where you need to use lights to navigate in a dark city, and it's so unlike the rest of the game.
[17:54.160 --> 17:54.500]  Yeah.
[17:55.100 --> 17:56.540]  You got the Krill car?
[17:57.140 --> 17:57.440]  Yeah.
[17:59.440 --> 18:01.900]  I think that was everyone's least favorite part of the game.
[18:03.580 --> 18:09.980]  I don't remember disliking it. It sticks out in my mind because it was just so unique to what the rest of the game was.
[18:10.820 --> 18:17.440]  So you were saying before we started filming, they've added in some cut content from the original game?
[18:17.680 --> 18:28.380]  I guess from my understanding, and this could be somewhat wrong, they ran out of time to put all of Act 5 in the game for the 360 on the initial release.
[18:29.180 --> 18:34.500]  So the final act of this game is very abbreviated compared to the rest of the other ones.
[18:35.360 --> 18:42.540]  When you play the original campaign where it's like, shit, we need to get on the train, and you're like, what train? What?
[18:45.840 --> 18:46.620]  Maybe it was that.
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.180]  Oh shit, okay. I'm gonna try to get to you.
[18:49.780 --> 18:53.300]  Yeah, so they had to release it without it being fully finished in that way.
[18:53.480 --> 19:01.240]  But they kept developing it, and then when it came to Windows Live, which was the PC release, they put in the rest of Act 5.
[19:01.240 --> 19:10.360]  And every iteration of Gears of War has had that full Act 5 in it from that point, but I've only played the original campaign on the 360.
[19:10.960 --> 19:14.780]  Yeah, I like to have the biggest gap possible between versions.
[19:16.280 --> 19:32.040]  You know what's insane? Eric and I filmed a Ratatouille today, and I looked to see the last time we played that, and it was two days forward from 2024.
[19:32.640 --> 19:40.960]  We're almost a full calendar year apart. The last achievement from the last video we made in it was August 22nd, 2024.
[19:43.260 --> 19:53.020]  It's crazy. Like, just not on purpose, just it lined up in a way where we're just two days away from a full calendar year separation between parts.
[19:54.720 --> 19:56.360]  Oh shit, oh shit, I thought that was you.
[19:57.500 --> 20:02.100]  I went around the back of them, I was flanking. I think we're supposed to be on that troika.
[20:03.240 --> 20:07.520]  That would make so much sense. I went back. I'm playing so defensive.
[20:08.040 --> 20:09.700]  Oh, you're just getting in their business.
[20:09.700 --> 20:15.640]  I'm getting stuck in, you know? It's not like it's Gears 5 insane, we're talking Gears 1 insane.
[20:15.640 --> 20:21.260]  That is true, but we were playing on a tier of difficulty that didn't exist yet for Gears 5. Was it invincible?
[20:22.400 --> 20:23.200]  Oh, inconceivable.
[20:25.340 --> 20:26.920]  Inconceivable. What are we shooting at?
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.160]  Carmine went down over there.
[20:30.300 --> 20:30.440]  What is back there?
[20:31.680 --> 20:33.600]  There's probably just one locust over there.
[20:33.820 --> 20:34.620]  Let me try to find him.
[20:36.020 --> 20:38.520]  What if Carmine just slipped on a banana peel?
[20:39.700 --> 20:40.480]  Shit, I got him.
[20:41.280 --> 20:42.040]  I got you, Carmine.
[20:42.840 --> 20:43.780]  They're just hanging out.
[20:45.720 --> 20:49.120]  Oh my god, the camera shake is crazy on the troika. Holy shit.
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.740]  They're so far away, too.
[20:54.500 --> 20:58.900]  I know. It doesn't overheat. Is this an infinite troika? Hell yeah.
[21:03.720 --> 21:07.800]  I wonder if that's how it was in this game. And I wonder when you're making a remaster,
[21:10.820 --> 21:16.760]  do you want to make the AI smarter, or is there a thing where you want to try to...
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.720]  I think you want the exact experience, but with quality of life changes.
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.120]  Yeah, like it looking nicer, but everything else being as close as possible.
[21:27.420 --> 21:30.540]  Better controls, or like...
[21:30.540 --> 21:36.740]  Well, we recently did a top 20 game list of all time in a really goofy way.
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.260]  But we each had to come up with our own 20.
[21:39.900 --> 21:42.800]  And I found it so uniquely difficult.
[21:43.140 --> 21:46.360]  Because I assume we're going to do more of those, so I did one for movies and TV as well.
[21:46.900 --> 21:55.560]  And it's so much more challenging, I think, for games, because the mechanics of how you experience them
[21:55.560 --> 21:59.260]  has shifted so much, as opposed to those other forms of media.
[22:00.120 --> 22:07.020]  Where things may look older, but you can make them 4K, and it's essentially like it was just made.
[22:07.580 --> 22:14.760]  Where games, there's such an evolution in speed and controls.
[22:16.100 --> 22:23.120]  When we were playing Rainbow Six Vegas 2 recently for the 360, the buttons were so wonky.
[22:23.780 --> 22:28.500]  You kind of forget that Call of Duty set a standard that eventually everybody agreed on.
[22:29.260 --> 22:35.000]  Like, not too relatively far in the past, there were still games that were like,
[22:35.080 --> 22:38.800]  what if we made the Y button melee instead of B?
[22:40.900 --> 22:46.940]  You just take for granted the evolution of both controls beyond just the visuals and games.
[22:47.600 --> 22:50.300]  Yeah, it was always weird playing a game and being like, alright, what are the buttons?
[22:51.180 --> 22:53.820]  As opposed to now just picking it up and being like, well, A is obviously jump.
[22:54.100 --> 22:57.680]  I remember playing Splinter Cell and Y was jump. I was like, oh, that's a new one.
[22:59.340 --> 23:01.560]  Is Y jump in Splinter Cell?
[23:02.260 --> 23:03.020]  It was in the first one.
[23:03.220 --> 23:04.720]  Oh my God, that's crazy.
[23:06.040 --> 23:10.180]  I think that's why those old classics hold up so well still.
[23:10.620 --> 23:13.660]  Because you're just moving like one direction or hitting one button.
[23:13.860 --> 23:19.620]  It's like Pac-Man, the controls can't be wonky. You just point it, and you're shifting.
[23:21.080 --> 23:21.560]  Good kills.
[23:23.920 --> 23:24.660]  Oh shit!
[23:24.660 --> 23:25.420]  We got any health somewhere?
[23:27.240 --> 23:29.640]  I don't have anything. What I want is a shotgun.
[23:31.660 --> 23:32.800]  Let's get you a shotgun.
[23:34.460 --> 23:35.020]  I'm done.
[23:36.480 --> 23:37.200]  I missed.
[23:38.860 --> 23:40.780]  You're done done or like you're down done?
[23:41.400 --> 23:43.240]  No, I wasn't either. I just thought I was done for.
[23:45.840 --> 23:49.060]  I just ran up to a locust hand thinking it was a grenade.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.880]  There were grenades next to it, but I was like, eh, let me grab this hand.
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.100]  Zen in the ivory, lady.
[23:53.780 --> 23:54.280]  Pot one.
[23:58.260 --> 24:03.240]  You need to look at what achievements you have and don't have to make sure you don't accidentally get one.
[24:04.260 --> 24:06.980]  You might need to shift how you're playing to make sure that...
[24:08.840 --> 24:13.020]  We're going to film some head-to-head versus in this tomorrow.
[24:13.860 --> 24:16.960]  And we need to make sure that you do not accidentally get a DLC map.
[24:19.380 --> 24:20.660]  Oh, that's a good point.
[24:21.400 --> 24:22.700]  Unless I played the DLC.
[24:23.860 --> 24:29.620]  That is true. You could play the 360 Gears of War and look at some achievements.
[24:31.580 --> 24:36.420]  Well, I mean, I don't know. I don't know whether I played the DLC back in the day. I have no memory of it.
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.280]  Could have happened.
[24:41.320 --> 24:44.800]  A fun time for multiplayer games where they would sell level packs.
[24:46.140 --> 24:48.940]  Yeah, I remember loving all the different map packs in Halo.
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.380]  They had cool names.
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.160]  Cool names and for Halo 2 having to go out and buy a disc, potentially.
[25:00.460 --> 25:02.200]  I still downloaded it on Halo 2.
[25:03.380 --> 25:05.100]  Oh, I went out and I bought the disc.
[25:05.660 --> 25:08.520]  You had to go to a really weird area of the dashboard to get it, though.
[25:09.000 --> 25:09.600]  Did you?
[25:10.180 --> 25:13.880]  Yeah, I remember there being a special download manager for it.
[25:16.280 --> 25:17.240]  I, uh...
[25:17.240 --> 25:19.640]  Oh, shit. Get away. This is bad.
[25:19.820 --> 25:20.800]  This is bad. We might...
[25:21.560 --> 25:24.260]  Oh, wow. A first setback.
[25:26.360 --> 25:29.380]  Um, I was going to say that I have all the demo discs.
[25:30.100 --> 25:31.240]  Oh, we're all the way back here.
[25:31.600 --> 25:34.620]  I have all the original Xbox and 360 demo discs.
[25:34.900 --> 25:41.960]  And with the demo discs for the 360, it would come with a downloadable thing
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.060]  for the most recent backward compatible games that would get updated.
[25:47.060 --> 25:51.560]  And I think that's the only way that you could do that without being connected online.
[25:52.460 --> 25:56.300]  It is a weird benefit I have of having the physical discs of all these demos
[25:56.300 --> 25:58.920]  where I could theoretically have a...
[25:58.920 --> 25:59.260]  That's crazy.
[26:00.200 --> 26:03.100]  Fully offline 360, but all the backward shit.
[26:03.800 --> 26:08.480]  I like your keep. You'll keep Xbox 360 demo discs, but not our own files.
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.280]  We're going to talk about this on the podcast tomorrow.
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.000]  Okay.
[26:16.400 --> 26:19.420]  I've come to... So for people that don't know the context,
[26:19.900 --> 26:22.220]  I've been getting rid of files because I haven't had space,
[26:22.400 --> 26:24.180]  and Gavin is very protective.
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.520]  Well, save it for the podcast.
[26:26.200 --> 26:28.360]  Well, this isn't what I'm going to be complaining about.
[26:28.580 --> 26:30.820]  Or not even complaining, but this isn't the thing I'm going to highlight,
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.160]  but just for context of it.
[26:32.880 --> 26:35.020]  I've come to the conclusion that I'm wrong.
[26:35.680 --> 26:37.940]  Like, I shouldn't be getting rid of stuff,
[26:37.940 --> 26:39.660]  but I am because I need the space.
[26:40.060 --> 26:43.200]  But I don't feel like your level of emotion about it.
[26:44.140 --> 26:45.260]  That's where my issue is.
[26:46.380 --> 26:50.520]  Well, I've just needed old files maybe like 15 times in my life,
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.720]  and it's way more convenient to keep them than it is to delete them.
[26:56.340 --> 26:58.100]  That's fair, but if it was so meaningful to you,
[26:58.420 --> 27:01.360]  I don't know why you don't just always are backing up those files.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.120]  Like, it is something that you view as so vital, yet you don't do it.
[27:09.480 --> 27:11.060]  Well, I backup my files.
[27:11.280 --> 27:14.720]  I just assumed because we talked about everyone keeping a local copy
[27:14.720 --> 27:17.260]  that we didn't have to have the universal backup up and running yet.
[27:18.300 --> 27:20.960]  It costs like $8,000 to set that thing up.
[27:22.040 --> 27:23.780]  Yeah, it's definitely expensive.
[27:24.340 --> 27:28.380]  So in the meantime, I assume we're all just doing what we said we would do it.
[27:29.620 --> 27:32.540]  But I don't see to you that that conversation means,
[27:32.640 --> 27:35.820]  I think, something different than it does to me or Eric.
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.220]  I think Geoff does it because he knows you so well.
[27:41.080 --> 27:43.320]  No, Geoff does it because Rooster Teeth does it.
[27:44.600 --> 27:46.040]  And every company does it.
[27:50.870 --> 27:52.870]  It's just how it works.
[27:56.110 --> 27:56.550]  Yeah.
[27:58.250 --> 27:59.130]  Yeah, you're not wrong.
[27:59.310 --> 28:01.290]  Like, the thing is, is that you're correct.
[28:01.510 --> 28:03.990]  I can't argue that you're incorrect in any way.
[28:04.910 --> 28:05.990]  I just think...
[28:07.270 --> 28:09.270]  I think you could be a little bit more relaxed.
[28:11.150 --> 28:12.370]  I think there's a scale.
[28:12.990 --> 28:15.190]  Alright, I'll rein it in.
[28:16.250 --> 28:19.130]  I probably won't rein it in on the podcast because...
[28:19.130 --> 28:20.010]  Oh, definitely not!
[28:22.970 --> 28:25.410]  I'm just blind firing this guy's face.
[28:26.010 --> 28:29.950]  I'm just bleeding out into my hands on the cement.
[28:30.590 --> 28:33.270]  Not being able to look up. I'm just living my own life.
[28:33.270 --> 28:34.230]  Oh, where are you?
[28:34.690 --> 28:38.850]  I couldn't tell you. I'm thinking to the left of the fountain if you're looking at a certain way.
[28:39.550 --> 28:41.070]  You might be able to see me if you hold left bumper.
[28:44.530 --> 28:45.430]  I will say...
[28:47.010 --> 28:50.490]  It's the most recent episode came out where you and I had this conversation about saving files.
[28:51.130 --> 28:53.850]  There are a lot of people, and once again, they're on the right side.
[28:54.250 --> 28:57.710]  But it is such an intellectually dishonest argument to be like,
[28:57.990 --> 28:59.430]  Well, what if YouTube went away?
[28:59.910 --> 29:00.990]  Then what would they do?
[29:00.990 --> 29:08.330]  And it's like the whole content creation market would completely shift in a way that us having the file...
[29:08.330 --> 29:11.070]  Like the significance of YouTube no longer existing...
[29:12.290 --> 29:16.130]  Us having the files is not going to be a solution to that issue.
[29:16.850 --> 29:19.050]  We kept all the files that were on Rooster Teeth only.
[29:19.670 --> 29:21.330]  That's how we were able to use them again later.
[29:23.370 --> 29:24.030]  What do you mean?
[29:24.750 --> 29:27.410]  When Rooster Teeth got shut down, everything was deleted.
[29:27.990 --> 29:28.850]  But we had it all.
[29:29.870 --> 29:31.330]  That's how we were able to use it.
[29:31.330 --> 29:33.970]  My point is that YouTube is so much larger than Rooster Teeth.
[29:34.770 --> 29:36.650]  I'm saying the people that are making the argument of like,
[29:36.670 --> 29:38.490]  Well, what if YouTube went away? You wouldn't have a cop.
[29:38.730 --> 29:39.890]  What do you want? Left or right?
[29:42.250 --> 29:42.610]  Left.
[29:47.490 --> 29:48.630]  I'm so sorry.
[29:49.630 --> 29:50.870]  I'm so sorry.
[29:53.850 --> 29:55.490]  I thought it would impair us.
[29:55.830 --> 29:57.330]  I didn't think it would separate us.
[29:57.330 --> 29:58.490]  I forgot how that works.
[29:58.530 --> 30:01.550]  I thought it was sending us both left, not I was picked left.
[30:01.990 --> 30:02.750]  Oh, man.
[30:04.130 --> 30:06.690]  Anyway, we should save files. You're right.
[30:07.570 --> 30:10.930]  The only time I ever delete them is when I don't have space, but I should.
[30:11.110 --> 30:13.470]  You never have to delete anything. Space is so cheap now.
[30:15.690 --> 30:17.070]  I don't agree with that.
[30:17.130 --> 30:21.090]  You can literally buy a 24 terabyte hard drive for less than 500 bucks.
[30:23.750 --> 30:25.610]  Yeah. Okay. That's fair.
[30:25.610 --> 30:32.990]  And we've, as of now, we only have 15 terabytes of regulation in total over like five years.
[30:34.610 --> 30:36.230]  It would all fit on one drive.
[30:38.070 --> 30:43.850]  I think for me, it is a thing of, it is not a thing I think about because you obviously have so much more experience.
[30:44.170 --> 30:51.170]  You also, you are like a black belt in data file management because of all the slow-mo stuff you do.
[30:51.170 --> 30:55.610]  The file sizes that you encounter and deal with and store, like...
[30:55.610 --> 31:00.010]  Yeah, well, that's why I think it's more, our stuff's easy. Regulation is so easy.
[31:00.550 --> 31:11.850]  Yeah. To me, it's all complicated. And even if it's not financially complicated, there is a attention to detail tax to manage and keep track of things.
[31:12.470 --> 31:20.170]  It's not about what if YouTube went away. It's like, what if YouTube decided that features are now behind the paywall?
[31:20.170 --> 31:26.990]  You have to like pay for YouTube to get access to certain levels of quality and stuff, which I think is already like partially in.
[31:28.070 --> 31:32.450]  And if we just say, well, we don't want to, we don't want that. We'll just do Patreon only, blah, blah, blah.
[31:32.610 --> 31:37.590]  We can't pull the files off YouTube. You can't download the file you uploaded.
[31:40.270 --> 31:48.230]  I'm glad that we're getting some of this talk out here because otherwise it would be 40 minutes on the next five minutes.
[31:48.230 --> 31:53.710]  You can download a compressed 720p copy of your uploaded file.
[31:54.210 --> 31:59.010]  I'm going to get this window guy. Grenade!
[32:01.850 --> 32:11.530]  It's interesting replaying this how there are sequences I remember so vividly and then moments like this where I have zero memory of this battle.
[32:11.530 --> 32:21.000]  Yeah, I remember. I remember the introduction of the talk bow being cool. Yes.
[32:22.240 --> 32:29.120]  Which my friend called the tall bow. I remember what happens to Kim pretty clearly. Oh, I don't. What happens to Kim?
[32:30.940 --> 32:36.060]  He meets a bad guy. Oh, he meets General Ram. General Ram.
[32:37.920 --> 32:42.060]  He gets all six teraflops of rippage.
[32:49.060 --> 32:54.720]  Okay, Troika guy's down. I'm going for him. I don't even need to. We killed them all.
[32:55.100 --> 32:56.780]  Hole! Locust hole!
[32:59.020 --> 33:02.840]  Locust hole. What if the next gears changed its name to Locust hole?
[33:02.840 --> 33:08.260]  Locust hole. Gears of War E-Day. Locust hole.
[33:11.960 --> 33:20.000]  If you could locust hole into any event, what would it be? Like locust holing into someone's wedding that you're not invited to would be pretty funny.
[33:21.020 --> 33:26.680]  Oh, that would be great. Shit. I should have Troika'd earlier. I think there's a guy on me.
[33:27.960 --> 33:35.840]  Maybe I try and do something like save a life of someone who died in a way that could have been hole prevented.
[33:39.360 --> 33:43.420]  Is there a historical figure that comes to mind for you that could have been hole prevented?
[33:43.700 --> 33:54.520]  Like imagine if I popped a hole up and the paparazzi chasing Princess Diana just went in the hole and then the actual car gets to get away.
[33:54.520 --> 33:57.520]  And then the paparazzi are like, how do we get in this bloody hole?
[33:59.100 --> 34:05.900]  You and I went different ways with it where I was thinking about using the hole for the person to fall into to save them.
[34:07.020 --> 34:12.340]  You were more leading towards using the hole to trap the bad guy in the scenario that we're setting up.
[34:12.900 --> 34:13.560]  Slow him down a bit.
[34:13.900 --> 34:21.680]  I was thinking about the Lincoln assassination if there was a hole underneath his chair suddenly and he just fell right at the moment.
[34:21.680 --> 34:28.660]  But it might be one of those time travel issues where it's like, ah, but that's what caused him to die.
[34:28.740 --> 34:32.920]  And then all the history books would be like, Lincoln fell into a sinkhole in the middle of a theater.
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.880]  I'm sure they've done this in Star Trek or something, but it would be a really funny premise to explore.
[34:42.540 --> 34:49.900]  Somebody going back in time to save somebody of moral good, of historic significance.
[34:51.080 --> 34:57.660]  And then just learning that by them being alive, the atrocities that came because of it in some way.
[34:58.080 --> 35:06.640]  And then just having to live with the information of being thankful that this person that was an absolute tragedy that they died actually passed for whatever reason.
[35:08.360 --> 35:16.700]  You never see that, like you always hear about like, it's always like back to the future stuff where it's like, oh, if you change the past, then you will be invisible in the future.
[35:16.840 --> 35:26.120]  But the idea that like you just exist, but you know of how miserable the existence is in an unexpected way, I think is so interesting.
[35:34.950 --> 35:36.690]  Did that guy say Monge?
[35:37.550 --> 35:38.910]  I believe he did. Yeah.
[35:40.810 --> 35:42.150]  He's a big Monge fan.
[35:42.930 --> 35:49.190]  I personally think they peaked after their first album, but I get the appeal.
[35:50.450 --> 35:56.590]  If somebody told me there was a locust metal band named Mosh, or what was it, Motch?
[36:00.450 --> 36:00.970]  Monge.
[36:07.390 --> 36:11.370]  I'm so wrapped up in the game that it's like, this happened with Halo before.
[36:11.370 --> 36:15.750]  When we're playing Halo, you will say a goofy name and I will say it once and then it's gone.
[36:15.890 --> 36:23.010]  It's gone forever. I don't catch it. I watch it as it flies by and comment on it. And then it just might as well be a shooting star.
[36:24.410 --> 36:27.190]  Dude, the blood goes a lot higher in the remake, I think.
[36:29.270 --> 36:30.370]  Splash into the ceiling.
[36:32.270 --> 36:34.070]  Yeah? I missed the ceiling splash.
[36:34.650 --> 36:39.210]  You know this map, right? You know where we are in the game right now.
[36:40.210 --> 36:41.030]  Where are we?
[36:41.770 --> 36:42.990]  We're just in this map.
[36:46.390 --> 36:54.470]  Do you think maybe after Gears of War 1, they kept the file so they could use it again in the future?
[36:58.390 --> 37:06.490]  There are so many stories in games of they didn't have the source code anymore so they can't remaster it or remake it. It becomes so much more effort.
[37:17.700 --> 37:29.200]  I wonder if this is the original voice acting or if they had a new recording done. I would assume it is two for the most part. Not all of them.
[37:34.880 --> 37:44.420]  I'm curious if things like how Carmine always dies, is that something they went into Gears 1 thinking would be a running gag?
[37:44.420 --> 37:46.140]  When do those things occur?
[37:46.600 --> 37:49.380]  I would assume in the production of the sequel.
[37:50.000 --> 37:50.340]  Yeah.
[37:50.820 --> 37:55.800]  Because you don't know how impactful a moment is going to be when you're making it the first time.
[37:56.020 --> 37:56.400]  That's true.
[37:58.140 --> 38:01.580]  Oh, we missed the cult tag back there. There was a bloody thing on the fountain.
[38:01.840 --> 38:02.320]  Oh, fuck. Really?
[38:03.520 --> 38:04.040]  Shit.
[38:05.420 --> 38:06.340]  I'll be going back.
[38:06.980 --> 38:09.100]  Oh, Troika! Back left.
[38:19.380 --> 38:20.280]  Grenade out!
[38:21.020 --> 38:21.580]  Nice.
[38:21.840 --> 38:23.540]  Did that land right under his legs?
[38:24.080 --> 38:27.300]  Dude! What a throw! That was awesome!
[38:27.960 --> 38:29.720]  That was pretty good for a blind fire throw.
[38:30.140 --> 38:31.760]  You blind fired that?
[38:32.020 --> 38:33.520]  That was insane!
[38:33.980 --> 38:35.160]  I just looked straight up.
[38:36.300 --> 38:36.980]  Carmine, no!
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.840]  Another one! Another one of the old Troika!
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.220]  Missed that one.
[38:43.220 --> 38:48.760]  Do you think that we, as in regulation, should have an E3 type event?
[38:49.580 --> 38:51.020]  For announcing new stuff?
[38:52.780 --> 38:53.600]  What, like we...
[38:55.180 --> 38:56.800]  What, where we announce our own stuff?
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.080]  Yeah, like if we were going to do a new series or a new show.
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.700]  Does that make any sense for us to have our own fake little mini event thing?
[39:05.700 --> 39:06.940]  Like a keynote?
[39:07.420 --> 39:09.320]  Like a keynote, but like a cool keynote.
[39:09.620 --> 39:13.140]  Like not a... I feel like keynote is such a non-exciting word.
[39:13.920 --> 39:16.200]  Do you think we can get Keanu Reeves to come out and announce...
[39:16.200 --> 39:16.460]  No.
[39:19.500 --> 39:20.800]  Maybe cameo style?
[39:23.060 --> 39:26.260]  Just like a cell phone vid of him pointing at his phone saying,
[39:26.400 --> 39:27.020]  You're breathtaking.
[39:27.020 --> 39:27.180]  Breathtaking.
[39:31.900 --> 39:35.520]  I read that they gave the guy that said you're breathtaking,
[39:35.680 --> 39:37.020]  they gave him like a free something.
[39:38.260 --> 39:38.860]  Did they?
[39:40.860 --> 39:41.960]  He deserves it.
[39:42.080 --> 39:49.400]  I want to get the woman from the one E3 where they did Elder Scrolls online
[39:49.400 --> 39:51.080]  and she was very excited about it.
[39:51.440 --> 39:52.940]  I don't know if you've ever seen that clip,
[39:52.940 --> 39:58.540]  but there's like one person who has a very distinctive, excited,
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.020]  like yell about every single thing that occurs for Elder Scrolls online.
[40:02.260 --> 40:05.320]  It's the most enthusiasm anyone has ever had for anything.
[40:06.680 --> 40:08.200]  I think that could be your baguette.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.080]  Splash.
[40:15.720 --> 40:21.360]  I feel like I am less successful than you've been blind firing grenades.
[40:23.120 --> 40:24.920]  My accuracy not great.
[40:26.060 --> 40:28.100]  Ah shit, they just keep popping out of this hole.
[40:29.620 --> 40:31.560]  Oh no, he's throwing a grenade, he's winding up.
[40:32.200 --> 40:32.800]  Get away.
[40:33.660 --> 40:34.560]  Don't get me, don't get me.
[40:34.900 --> 40:36.000]  Oh, you splashed him.
[40:36.740 --> 40:38.140]  I think I may have got it in the hole.
[40:39.380 --> 40:40.560]  It may have been hole one.
[40:41.720 --> 40:42.460]  Hole two, I guess.
[40:44.100 --> 40:46.400]  Are you on the opposite side? Are we pinching these guys?
[40:47.540 --> 40:47.780]  Yeah.
[40:48.260 --> 40:48.740]  Hell yeah.
[40:50.240 --> 40:51.740]  I think we got to get Troika ready.
[40:52.380 --> 40:53.680]  No respect for tiling.
[40:55.260 --> 40:55.980]  He's locust.
[40:59.660 --> 41:02.360]  What if we pop up here? No, no, no.
[41:02.400 --> 41:06.880]  If we pop up there, even if they kill us, the tiling work will be ruined.
[41:07.780 --> 41:10.800]  They'll never make it look as nice as it once was.
[41:11.560 --> 41:15.700]  That should be the sequel to this. You have to retile all the levels.
[41:15.980 --> 41:16.200]  Yeah.
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.900]  Like a spin-off game in which you are the person that has to do the repairs after the battles of the Gears game.
[41:25.740 --> 41:26.860]  The infrastructure.
[41:30.260 --> 41:31.320]  Like a SimCity...
[41:34.220 --> 41:36.560]  He's not going to get to play SimCity Builder Gears.
[41:40.240 --> 41:41.280]  I'm on the Troika.
[41:47.380 --> 41:50.600]  Definitely feels more colorful than it originally was. It's less brown.
[41:53.500 --> 41:54.380]  Oh, headshot.
[41:56.800 --> 42:04.380]  It'd be great if they modified the Seriously Achievement so it worked like it did in Gears of War 2, where just kills anywhere counted.
[42:05.260 --> 42:06.780]  Oh, instead of one area.
[42:07.200 --> 42:07.640]  Yes.
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.860]  I think that would be a welcome change.
[42:10.940 --> 42:19.320]  It's nice in Gears 2, but it did lead to me just playing one sequence over and over again for hours.
[42:20.240 --> 42:22.480]  I never did any of those grind achievements, I don't think.
[42:24.740 --> 42:29.000]  That's fair. I mean, what about in Dead Rising 7 Day Survivor? Did you get that one?
[42:29.380 --> 42:30.160]  No, I didn't do that.
[42:30.480 --> 42:30.840]  Really?
[42:31.720 --> 42:33.820]  I think that was just mainly a skill issue.
[42:36.280 --> 42:41.040]  That's fair. There has to be one grindy achievement that you've gotten, like one of the main ones.
[42:42.040 --> 42:46.040]  For how long you've been playing Xbox and all the achievements you've gotten over time.
[42:49.300 --> 42:50.160]  It's possible.
[42:50.940 --> 42:53.040]  Ah, the music's good in this game.
[42:53.040 --> 42:53.900]  It's great music.
[42:56.160 --> 42:56.900]  I'm down.
[42:57.360 --> 42:59.220]  Yeah, I'm working on it.
[43:00.060 --> 43:02.460]  Okay, I got you. Come on, get up!
[43:03.020 --> 43:04.600]  I'm up! Oh shit!
[43:06.220 --> 43:14.480]  There is something really funny about a character getting gunned down to their knees and their best friend running up and yelling, get up!
[43:16.960 --> 43:18.140]  Oh, nice pick up.
[43:18.560 --> 43:20.840]  I don't really know what's going on there, there was a little scuffle.
[43:21.020 --> 43:21.860]  I'm with you.
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.700]  Okay, I got the pieces.
[43:28.400 --> 43:30.480]  Do you think locusts would be, like, tasty?
[43:31.460 --> 43:33.380]  Do you think, like, a locust steak would be good?
[43:34.500 --> 43:37.000]  I bet not. I bet it would be, like, a lot of pus.
[43:37.420 --> 43:38.580]  Oh, you think it would be pus?
[43:38.980 --> 43:40.140]  They seem quite pussy.
[43:41.020 --> 43:45.880]  For me, my brain immediately goes that they would taste like crocodile or, like, alligator.
[43:46.360 --> 43:47.800]  But that would be the animal equivalent.
[43:48.140 --> 43:49.820]  Oh, shotgun. Hell yeah.
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.340]  You found one?
[43:52.240 --> 43:53.020]  I got one.
[43:53.780 --> 43:57.560]  Oh, here we go!
[43:58.820 --> 44:00.800]  My favorite character of the series.
[44:02.740 --> 44:03.700]  This guy?
[44:04.160 --> 44:04.780]  This guy.
[44:07.860 --> 44:08.580]  Coltrane.
[44:09.500 --> 44:10.860]  It's the Coltrane baby.
[44:11.280 --> 44:14.620]  Or as known in Gears 1 as Alpha Team Soldier.
[44:18.180 --> 44:19.480]  He's Cole in this, though.
[44:20.260 --> 44:20.580]  He is.
[44:21.440 --> 44:23.720]  When I was holding Y, that's when it popped up as.
[44:24.160 --> 44:24.660]  Oh, I see.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.280]  We don't know his name yet.
[44:30.140 --> 44:33.080]  Well, he went down. It wasn't the best intro for him, I feel like.
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.940]  Coltrane runs on revives. It's okay.
[44:40.240 --> 44:40.920]  We all do.
[44:41.720 --> 44:44.800]  I like they kept in all the really light body ragdoll.
[44:45.520 --> 44:45.920]  Yeah.
[44:46.320 --> 44:49.820]  But you can just suddenly start kicking people across the room.
[44:50.400 --> 44:54.620]  We're not supposed to be here, but it just feels like there'd be a cog tag in here, so I gotta go check it out.
[44:55.040 --> 44:55.800]  See what's going on.
[44:56.340 --> 44:56.780]  Yeah, that's fair.
[44:57.020 --> 44:58.160]  I'm not seeing anything.
[45:04.320 --> 45:09.040]  It is fun to re-experience this, having played all these games.
[45:10.020 --> 45:10.420]  Yeah.
[45:10.840 --> 45:13.320]  Having not done it for me, at least personally.
[45:15.560 --> 45:18.280]  I've never gone back to the campaign of this game.
[45:21.520 --> 45:23.300]  The sonic device.
[45:24.680 --> 45:26.880]  Moving around at the speed of sound.
[45:30.300 --> 45:32.480]  Jim Carrey as Eggman shows up.
[45:36.480 --> 45:40.980]  Isn't it funny that he sang a song that had the lyrics, I am the Eggman?
[45:42.580 --> 45:42.880]  Yeah.
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.860]  And then became Eggman.
[45:46.880 --> 45:47.640]  Really Babe Ruthed it.
[45:48.340 --> 45:49.220]  He called his shot.
[45:54.740 --> 45:58.300]  You need to watch Copper Mountain so we can do the next episode of Carry Away.
[45:59.380 --> 46:00.520]  Oh yeah, when do you want to do it?
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.280]  Whenever you watch it.
[46:03.140 --> 46:03.740]  You want to do it this week?
[46:04.240 --> 46:05.060]  Yeah, sure.
[46:06.120 --> 46:07.660]  They messed this picture up.
[46:07.940 --> 46:09.260]  It's only a 40 minute movie.
[46:12.940 --> 46:14.480]  Still looking for these tags.
[46:16.120 --> 46:18.580]  By collecting them you unlock comic books?
[46:19.380 --> 46:23.220]  Is this the game where they introduce chainsawing the couch in half?
[46:23.520 --> 46:24.020]  Is it?
[46:24.460 --> 46:25.720]  It doesn't look like it.
[46:28.200 --> 46:28.640]  Maybe?
[46:29.200 --> 46:31.260]  Was there an animation for what you were thinking of?
[46:31.380 --> 46:32.280]  Maybe not.
[46:32.940 --> 46:34.280]  I just remember breaking them.
[46:34.740 --> 46:35.420]  Yeah, maybe that was it.
[46:36.420 --> 46:38.540]  Is there going to be some ice that you can shoot me through?
[46:41.600 --> 46:44.180]  I don't think we got ice until Gears 5.
[46:44.800 --> 46:47.200]  What the hell was that?
[46:47.680 --> 46:49.660]  That means I want to go this way.
[46:50.360 --> 46:50.840]  Cocktags!
[46:51.160 --> 46:51.260]  Yeah!
[46:52.440 --> 46:54.220]  They're so blue and shiny.
[46:54.760 --> 46:57.400]  Has the video come out yet where I dropped a bookcase on your head?
[46:58.760 --> 46:59.820]  I don't think so.
[47:02.740 --> 47:06.140]  For those that want to watch our Gears 5 playthrough, they are on our Patreon.
[47:06.940 --> 47:09.480]  At the lowest tier of bog standard.
[47:09.860 --> 47:11.120]  Pretty much every other Monday.
[47:11.240 --> 47:14.540]  You can watch endless hours of Gears of War.
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.120]  And us struggling massively.
[47:18.180 --> 47:21.300]  Eric and Nick went out of town for like a week straight and then we just did that?
[47:22.900 --> 47:23.980]  We did, yeah.
[47:24.820 --> 47:26.600]  We were just having so much fun with it.
[47:26.640 --> 47:31.120]  It was just every day we would play like six hours of Gears for a week.
[47:31.240 --> 47:31.940]  It was awesome.
[47:33.260 --> 47:34.100]  Oh shit.
[47:35.060 --> 47:35.500]  Wretches!
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.600]  I like in the first iteration of every game franchise, they're really good at naming the enemies.
[47:42.080 --> 47:43.200]  And then they kind of lose track of it.
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.560]  Like I don't know what a lot of the shit in Gears 5 was called but...
[47:47.560 --> 47:49.460]  Oh that's cool, the bloody footprints up the wall.
[47:49.740 --> 47:55.640]  This game also does a really good job of like introducing a bunch of different variations of the enemies that you'll be facing.
[47:56.280 --> 47:56.520]  Yeah.
[47:58.660 --> 48:04.020]  Where I love, like obviously the Halo franchise, one of my favorite properties of all time.
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.300]  And you get that amazing reveal of the flood but there isn't like...
[48:08.060 --> 48:09.720]  I guess there's like brutes and stuff.
[48:09.820 --> 48:13.180]  Maybe that's not fair but...
[48:13.180 --> 48:18.400]  The range of enemies you face in these games, they all feel so different even though...
[48:18.400 --> 48:20.800]  Like they feel cohesive but also unique.
[48:21.220 --> 48:26.520]  Yeah, because you can tell they're planning enemies like we need one that can do this and we need one that's like difficult to fight because of this.
[48:26.920 --> 48:29.460]  And then in the sequels they have to be like...
[48:30.020 --> 48:31.880]  Something between this and this?
[48:32.160 --> 48:32.560]  Yes.
[48:33.260 --> 48:34.980]  Or we're creating like new environments.
[48:35.620 --> 48:39.860]  We're doing ice stuff, like what would make sense for Ice Locust?
[48:45.460 --> 48:47.880]  That's you whenever I ask for a tail sink.
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.860]  I'm gonna start covering the flank.
[49:07.100 --> 49:08.820]  Flank seems clear so far.
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.260]  I don't know if we're just going at like a slower rate or maybe they climb down and they didn't come from behind.
[49:17.980 --> 49:20.120]  Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[49:20.880 --> 49:21.540]  Oh shit.
[49:21.540 --> 49:23.000]  Oh shit.
[49:23.440 --> 49:25.160]  I'm gnashing, I'm gnashing.
[49:25.760 --> 49:26.680]  I'm down.
[49:28.660 --> 49:29.760]  Got you, got you.
[49:30.120 --> 49:30.660]  Thank you.
[49:30.920 --> 49:31.680]  Oh, yeah.
[49:32.580 --> 49:33.540]  Get out of here.
[49:34.740 --> 49:35.980]  Back in your hole.
[49:39.570 --> 49:40.470]  Hell yeah.
[49:40.730 --> 49:42.530]  We're just both shooting down a hole.
[49:48.460 --> 49:53.620]  What if we get Geoff to watch the edits of these videos and voice the robot?
[49:55.820 --> 49:56.840]  You want the Hammeradon?
[49:59.600 --> 50:00.660]  Can we both have one?
[50:00.900 --> 50:01.700]  Oh, we can both have one.
[50:02.040 --> 50:02.460]  Never mind.
[50:02.600 --> 50:02.920]  Perfect.
[50:03.460 --> 50:06.620]  Is there two satellites or does the satellite have two nozzles?
[50:07.040 --> 50:07.320]  Oh.
[50:08.560 --> 50:09.560]  Double nozzles, yeah.
[50:10.940 --> 50:14.720]  And then when four player co-op was added, they had to add two more nozzles to the satellite.
[50:14.840 --> 50:15.380]  It was a whole thing.
[50:17.300 --> 50:20.520]  I do wonder how many Hammeradons can occur at one time.
[50:21.260 --> 50:22.740]  Is it only one?
[50:22.840 --> 50:24.380]  Do they have one satellite for it?
[50:25.420 --> 50:31.020]  What if there was an achievement for getting a thousand kills with the Hammer of Dawn, but you have to melee people with the handle?
[50:34.120 --> 50:35.060]  Shit, shit, shit.
[50:35.300 --> 50:36.440]  Things, things coming.
[50:36.680 --> 50:37.160]  Things coming.
[50:37.340 --> 50:38.460]  Yeah, the stuff, the things.
[50:38.700 --> 50:38.980]  What are they called?
[50:39.100 --> 50:39.440]  I'm down.
[50:40.100 --> 50:40.540]  Oh, shit.
[50:41.700 --> 50:43.680]  I better get you the goddammit.
[50:44.100 --> 50:44.840]  Thank you.
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.280]  Oh, fuck you.
[50:50.540 --> 50:51.200]  Fuck you.
[50:54.060 --> 50:54.960]  Did you get me?
[50:55.460 --> 50:55.760]  No.
[50:55.760 --> 50:56.300]  Okay.
[50:57.100 --> 50:57.900]  Can't get you.
[50:58.660 --> 50:59.880]  Can you blind fire the Hammer?
[51:00.060 --> 51:00.440]  Damn.
[51:06.250 --> 51:07.890]  Oh, that was sick.
[51:08.110 --> 51:09.210]  Oh, that poor guy.
[51:10.090 --> 51:11.030]  What happened to you?
[51:13.290 --> 51:14.170]  Got downed.
[51:25.780 --> 51:28.500]  Imagine using a Hammer of Dawn to like cook a hot dog.
[51:31.640 --> 51:32.520]  Some barbecuing.
[51:36.580 --> 51:38.660]  I want to watch the sky when you do it.
[51:38.680 --> 51:39.100]  Okay.
[51:40.520 --> 51:41.980]  Try to get a lock on it.
[51:42.340 --> 51:42.820]  Here we go.
[51:45.360 --> 51:46.340]  That looks cool.
[51:47.640 --> 51:50.000]  I mean, it's the goal of that, right?
[51:50.420 --> 51:52.980]  Like, the ineffectiveness, you need it to look cool.
[51:53.780 --> 51:54.020]  Yeah.
[51:57.900 --> 52:01.560]  Only when satellites are overhead, which is as long as we stand here.
[52:05.780 --> 52:06.980]  Oh, come near me.
[52:07.400 --> 52:08.320]  Where you at? Okay.
[52:08.540 --> 52:08.960]  On my way.
[52:09.480 --> 52:13.280]  Alright, the challenge is you have to cancel the Hammer of Dawn at the last possible second.
[52:13.680 --> 52:13.940]  Okay.
[52:15.660 --> 52:17.560]  Alright, your turn.
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.100]  No!
[52:25.860 --> 52:26.640]  You win.
[52:30.360 --> 52:30.840]  No!
[52:32.340 --> 52:33.120]  Oh, no!
[52:33.120 --> 52:34.220]  Oh, no!
[52:37.400 --> 52:40.100]  We both lost, it turns out.
[52:42.120 --> 52:43.280]  Oh, shit.
[52:47.200 --> 52:50.180]  He said, don't use them until I give the order.
[52:50.440 --> 52:53.740]  He didn't mention about having a contest after he does.
[52:54.360 --> 52:55.800]  And no contests.
[52:57.500 --> 52:58.760]  Especially at the end.
[53:06.490 --> 53:07.950]  The Hammer of Dawn is so cool.
[53:20.340 --> 53:25.020]  It might be the most powerful, I feel, using any weapon in any game.
[53:25.620 --> 53:27.540]  Like, obviously, the BFG is a classic.
[53:28.140 --> 53:29.120]  It's a great one.
[53:29.860 --> 53:33.720]  But I just feel like I could destroy anything when I have a Hammer of Dawn.
[53:38.020 --> 53:39.740]  Oh, I think that guy didn't make it.
[53:43.200 --> 53:47.620]  Come on, come on, come on.
[53:47.760 --> 53:48.120]  Yeah.
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.020]  It'd be cool if we both did it at the same place.
[53:57.100 --> 53:59.480]  It would, like, cause a flare effect or like a double...
[54:00.060 --> 54:02.000]  Oh, yeah, like it came down blue or something.
[54:12.260 --> 54:16.400]  If somebody offered you, and there's only one of them in the world, it could only be used once.
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.880]  A Hammer of Dawn, would you take it?
[54:20.360 --> 54:21.220]  Yeah, who wouldn't?
[54:21.440 --> 54:21.600]  Really?
[54:23.100 --> 54:24.620]  I wouldn't want the responsibility.
[54:27.380 --> 54:29.240]  I feel like it'd come in real handy.
[54:30.640 --> 54:32.060]  But you can only use it once.
[54:32.560 --> 54:32.920]  Yeah.
[54:33.340 --> 54:34.900]  When do you think it would be handy to use?
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.480]  When was there a time in your life where you thought, if only I had a Hammer of Dawn?
[54:39.980 --> 54:40.600]  9-11.
[54:42.420 --> 54:43.540]  That's what you thought?
[54:47.180 --> 54:49.960]  What, like, five years before the game came out?
[54:50.040 --> 54:50.500]  You didn't even know?
[54:50.560 --> 54:51.600]  You're just like, you know what?
[54:51.660 --> 54:52.300]  Hammer of Dawn.
[54:52.880 --> 54:53.980]  Oh, so it has to be...
[54:53.980 --> 54:54.340]  That would resolve things.
[54:54.340 --> 54:56.520]  Post-2005 or post-2025?
[54:57.500 --> 54:58.500]  Is it from now on?
[54:59.080 --> 55:02.820]  I guess from the point in which they made it in the game, right?
[55:02.940 --> 55:03.780]  Like, it wouldn't...
[55:03.780 --> 55:03.960]  Okay.
[55:04.340 --> 55:07.880]  I'm not saying it just didn't exist in the world, and then they brought it into the game.
[55:09.340 --> 55:11.560]  Search for Alpha Squad, destroy all the Cedars.
[55:11.640 --> 55:12.620]  What are we not destroying?
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.340]  I'm so nervous of that.
[55:16.580 --> 55:17.460]  Destroy Cedars?
[55:18.300 --> 55:19.820]  Does it just look similar?
[55:21.000 --> 55:22.760]  Yeah, it just... this is a different area.
[55:22.860 --> 55:24.240]  It just looks very similar.
[55:25.300 --> 55:28.760]  I was popping Cedars left and right.
[55:30.540 --> 55:32.460]  I always knew you were a Cedar guy.
[55:33.900 --> 55:35.920]  Feels like a brand of sunflower seeds.
[55:37.820 --> 55:38.560]  Oh! Oh!
[55:38.680 --> 55:39.720]  Oh, shit!
[55:41.340 --> 55:42.420]  Someone chainsawed me?
[55:44.680 --> 55:47.020]  No! No! Get back! Get back! Get back!
[55:47.980 --> 55:49.640]  I'm using my body to block them.
[55:51.260 --> 55:51.700]  Okay.
[55:54.020 --> 55:56.280]  Satellites are triangulating. There's three satellites, then.
[55:57.460 --> 55:59.180]  Okay. I'm getting you.
[56:05.060 --> 56:05.500]  Shit!
[56:09.390 --> 56:17.410]  Do you think that all the Hammeredons use the same network, or is there, like, someone who's, like, on Verizon, and theirs never connects, and they get shit for it?
[56:17.930 --> 56:19.990]  You have to turn on roaming on your Hammer of Dawn.
[56:20.090 --> 56:20.310]  Yeah!
[56:22.050 --> 56:24.090]  I don't have the data to do this!
[56:24.090 --> 56:25.870]  It's gonna cost me a fortune!
[56:28.630 --> 56:32.070]  We're gonna die! I'm gonna die from these high prices!
[56:33.710 --> 56:35.850]  We'll figure it out! We don't need it!
[56:39.430 --> 56:39.830]  Ugh!
[56:41.850 --> 56:52.390]  That'd be a fun thing to have in a video game. Fun, maybe not the right word, but it'd just be interesting where, you know, like, in a Borderlands-type game, how there's numbers flying constantly from, like, damage?
[56:52.930 --> 57:00.890]  If there was a thing that displayed how much money it would cost to, like, use the weaponry, like, every gunshot, it displayed the cost?
[57:01.070 --> 57:09.930]  Like, a seriously achievement, but instead of kills, it is dollars that you've used in firing weapons and doing damage to structures.
[57:10.450 --> 57:15.530]  What if you were allowed to harm and murder people, but you had to do it with gold?
[57:18.130 --> 57:19.090]  I'd do...
[57:19.090 --> 57:21.550]  Are you fucking Goldfinger?
[57:22.230 --> 57:28.630]  Like, if you could get away with it, but you have to, like, buy a gold knife, so every kill takes a long time to save up.
[57:29.250 --> 57:35.790]  Because if there's one thing that people associate people with absurd's amount of money, it's high character.
[57:37.610 --> 57:40.050]  It's moral thoughtfulness.
[57:42.450 --> 57:45.050]  I think it'd make people think twice about murdering.
[57:46.690 --> 57:47.230]  Would it?
[57:47.770 --> 57:51.110]  You don't just go and buy the gun, you'd be like, alright, I need a...
[57:51.110 --> 57:54.010]  I think you're thinking about this from the wrong perspective.
[57:55.770 --> 57:56.250]  Yeah...
[57:56.250 --> 57:59.250]  Also, wait, are you trying to argue that...
[58:01.070 --> 58:02.810]  Crime is already illegal.
[58:04.730 --> 58:09.230]  All you've done is legalize the way for extremely wealthy people to do it.
[58:09.690 --> 58:16.190]  I wasn't preventing the working man from murdering, I was just making it free for billionaires to kill whoever they want.
[58:17.830 --> 58:19.670]  Now, yeah, that's a terrible scenario.
[58:19.690 --> 58:22.170]  It's an awful... yeah, that doesn't work.
[58:22.170 --> 58:24.590]  Yeah, I got confused by my own situation there.
[58:24.670 --> 58:26.130]  By my own scenario.
[58:28.650 --> 58:34.170]  The premise that the average working person is like, oh man, I would totally murder if only...
[58:35.650 --> 58:37.810]  I got mixed up in golden bullet mode.
[58:38.330 --> 58:38.730]  Sure.
[58:41.210 --> 58:42.490]  Ah, shit, I went down.
[58:42.590 --> 58:43.510]  Gotcha. Yeah, I gotcha.
[58:44.290 --> 58:45.850]  Didn't even have to use a golden bullet.
[58:46.190 --> 58:47.690]  Ah, shit, I punched Kim in the face.
[58:48.170 --> 58:49.410]  Just panic throwing.
[58:49.750 --> 58:50.910]  Yeah, I just panic punched him.
[58:52.170 --> 58:52.450]  Okay.
[58:53.410 --> 58:53.730]  Oh.
[58:54.470 --> 58:54.890]  Cog tech.
[58:57.530 --> 58:58.530]  Are you alright?
[59:00.490 --> 59:01.530]  Oh, Rojas.
[59:12.340 --> 59:17.160]  And we would get revenge for Rojas, but unfortunately he was killed with a golden sword.
[59:21.500 --> 59:26.220]  And then in the sky above the city, a mixture of uranium and gold.
[59:29.740 --> 59:31.980]  I like the posing of this statue.
[59:32.100 --> 59:36.300]  It feels very much like him going like, you guys fucking read this thing?
[59:37.000 --> 59:38.760]  This thing's crazy.
[59:38.900 --> 59:39.060]  Guys, check this out.
[59:39.060 --> 59:41.800]  I never actually read the instruction manual.
[59:43.020 --> 59:44.880]  That's me in like every video game.
[59:45.440 --> 59:46.680]  30 hours in learning.
[59:46.800 --> 59:47.460]  Oh, you can sprint.
[59:48.840 --> 59:50.280]  Act one ashes, wrap.
[59:50.460 --> 59:51.500]  Should we stop here, Gavin?
[59:51.620 --> 59:54.160]  Should we stop down and then continue our run in another video?
[59:54.520 --> 59:55.480]  Make this part one?
[59:56.220 --> 59:57.700]  We've been going for about an hour.
[59:58.380 --> 59:59.060]  Isn't there five?
[59:59.540 --> 01:00:00.880]  Oh, there's five acts.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:05.600]  There is, but if we were to do the full act, it'll probably be so much time for this one video.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.280]  Let's spread it out a little bit.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:08.760]  Listen, we had 18 parts.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.100]  We'll do it in less than 18 parts.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:11.440]  That I can promise.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:12.380]  Big time.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.240]  But thank you so much for watching.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.740]  Once again, thank you so much to Xbox for sending us a code.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.880]  We're going to be doing some versus stuff coming up.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.440]  I'm excited.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.620]  Team No Bad Ideas versus Plan G.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.660]  It's going to be great.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.000]  Thank you for playing this with me, Gavin.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.180]  I'm so excited to continue this year's journey with you.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:29.900]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.280]  Hell yeah.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.120]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.380]  Goodbye.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.340]  Bye.
