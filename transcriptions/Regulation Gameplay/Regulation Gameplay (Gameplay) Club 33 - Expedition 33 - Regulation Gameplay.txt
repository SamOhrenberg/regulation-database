[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  What's with the Andrew's opera music here?
[00:04.960 --> 00:06.660]  This is some emotional singing.
[00:07.260 --> 00:09.200]  Oh, this is what emo is. OK.
[00:10.520 --> 00:13.120]  This is what this is, what emo is.
[00:13.140 --> 00:13.940]  This is the Black Parade, Geoff.
[00:14.500 --> 00:15.520]  I don't know if you've heard about it.
[00:15.520 --> 00:16.940]  When I was a young boy.
[00:18.320 --> 00:20.320]  OK, all right, let's get started.
[00:20.500 --> 00:21.260]  Hey, guys, what's up?
[00:21.300 --> 00:25.600]  It's Claire Obscura Expedition 33, a game that I don't know anything about,
[00:25.660 --> 00:26.580]  but I'm playing, baby.
[00:26.840 --> 00:28.300]  It's really good. You're going to love it.
[00:28.300 --> 00:29.160]  I just turned it on.
[00:29.160 --> 00:32.020]  Should I do anything in settings or do I just go for a new game?
[00:32.640 --> 00:36.080]  Now, does he does he know that this is really just blueprints
[00:36.080 --> 00:37.020]  under a different title?
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.320]  Oh, great. Don't even say it.
[00:39.900 --> 00:41.240]  Don't even say it.
[00:43.560 --> 00:46.640]  If I have to solve puzzles in this, I'm going to be so pissed.
[00:47.360 --> 00:49.440]  I haven't touched that game since we recorded it,
[00:49.460 --> 00:51.080]  because I was in case we do more content.
[00:51.160 --> 00:52.140]  I don't want to spoil anything.
[00:52.300 --> 00:53.380]  There you go. You don't want to.
[00:53.460 --> 00:55.960]  I know, but I'm sitting here like I just want to I want to solve some puzzles.
[00:56.220 --> 00:58.840]  Dude, we could knock out seven or eight days real fast.
[00:59.160 --> 01:01.360]  Oh, did someone ding up the Eiffel Tower?
[01:01.760 --> 01:04.060]  Yeah. Yeah. The Eiffel Tower is all dinged.
[01:04.500 --> 01:05.940]  This is a French developer.
[01:07.060 --> 01:08.180]  Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.920]  The art is taking place in France.
[01:11.060 --> 01:11.860]  This is so important.
[01:14.180 --> 01:16.260]  Where will the triumph go now?
[01:16.380 --> 01:18.240]  What do you think they lit the number 34 with?
[01:19.260 --> 01:20.160]  Do you think those are LEDs?
[01:21.080 --> 01:22.260]  Yeah, they're drones.
[01:23.600 --> 01:24.640]  They're drones.
[01:25.080 --> 01:26.260]  There's a drone show every night.
[01:29.160 --> 01:31.920]  I was thinking the other day how streetlights should be drones.
[01:32.700 --> 01:35.380]  I was thinking the other day how if the
[01:37.320 --> 01:41.420]  if the Eiffel Tower doesn't survive, how would all the pots and plants?
[01:41.840 --> 01:42.680]  But I guess they did.
[01:43.140 --> 01:43.660]  Oh, this is yours.
[01:43.940 --> 01:45.200]  They got to come back later.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.980]  This is yours. You can regrow plants.
[01:47.120 --> 01:50.100]  So you want to make all streetlights drones?
[01:50.900 --> 01:52.060]  Yeah, right. Terrible idea.
[01:52.100 --> 01:54.440]  They just light empty streets a lot of the time.
[01:54.500 --> 01:57.740]  What if they were just on the move and they flew to where all the traffic was?
[01:57.740 --> 01:58.620]  Would they follow you?
[01:59.300 --> 02:01.020]  They just follow the busyness.
[02:01.080 --> 02:01.880]  Is that Jake Gyllenhaal?
[02:02.660 --> 02:04.360]  Yeah, I thought it looked like Robert Pattinson.
[02:05.120 --> 02:05.960]  Yeah, it does kind of.
[02:06.300 --> 02:07.420]  Is it both of those dudes?
[02:07.900 --> 02:09.260]  Holy shit, they got both of them?
[02:09.260 --> 02:11.140]  God, this is so French.
[02:11.220 --> 02:12.540]  Holy shit, a mime!
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.480]  Who's this mime ass girl?
[02:14.720 --> 02:15.500]  What is this?
[02:16.040 --> 02:17.740]  Yeah, it's kind of Robert Pattinson.
[02:18.020 --> 02:19.800]  It is looking more and more like him every second.
[02:21.220 --> 02:25.260]  She looks like she just came from the baguette store where she sells cheese.
[02:25.500 --> 02:26.720]  Like, this is ridiculous.
[02:26.720 --> 02:28.320]  Where's her bag full of baguette?
[02:28.620 --> 02:30.520]  He looks like his character in The Lighthouse.
[02:30.740 --> 02:32.800]  He does.
[02:35.820 --> 02:37.640]  OK, so hang on.
[02:38.080 --> 02:39.360]  Are they French?
[02:39.680 --> 02:40.920]  Oh, it does look like Robert Pattinson.
[02:41.240 --> 02:41.900]  His name's Gustav.
[02:44.220 --> 02:44.960]  Good morning.
[02:45.400 --> 02:47.020]  That's a pretty French hand he's got there.
[02:47.960 --> 02:48.900]  That is a French hand.
[02:49.300 --> 02:51.280]  But they're French, but they have English accents.
[02:52.580 --> 02:55.520]  Uh, it's like set in France, but it's not.
[02:56.280 --> 02:59.000]  I guess technically it's not even France, I don't think.
[02:59.940 --> 03:01.360]  This is his own world.
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.360]  That was the Eiffel Tower, and she's the most French person I've ever seen.
[03:05.880 --> 03:07.940]  Yeah, it's like a French realm.
[03:08.660 --> 03:12.520]  I think it's like it's obviously like French culture
[03:13.220 --> 03:15.340]  imprinted onto this fictional area.
[03:15.960 --> 03:16.320]  Got it.
[03:16.760 --> 03:17.240]  Gotcha.
[03:17.460 --> 03:21.420]  So if like, if like France, if France won World War
[03:21.420 --> 03:25.180]  Three and took over the world, yes, and then destroyed their own shit.
[03:25.620 --> 03:26.700]  Well, that's exactly.
[03:27.100 --> 03:31.000]  Yeah, just, uh, it's kind of like that, like man in the high tower.
[03:31.200 --> 03:33.420]  If one of the Nazis won, it's like, what if France won?
[03:33.540 --> 03:34.640]  Nobody ever thought to ask that.
[03:35.480 --> 03:37.460]  Well, yeah, I can think of some reasons.
[03:39.460 --> 03:42.220]  I really thought Gavin would be all over the French in this thing.
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.160]  Like he would just like hammer, hammer, hammer.
[03:45.640 --> 03:47.620]  Uh, I don't think they've done anything yet.
[03:48.920 --> 03:51.980]  Gavin, what's what's what's the French word for hammer?
[03:53.820 --> 03:54.400]  A hammer.
[03:54.560 --> 03:55.540]  That's a good, that's a good question.
[03:55.780 --> 03:55.940]  Hammer.
[03:56.060 --> 03:56.300]  Hammer.
[03:59.800 --> 04:02.860]  If anyone would know the French word for something, wouldn't it be Andrew?
[04:03.360 --> 04:04.360]  Oh, yeah, it's true.
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.800]  On the wrong side of Canada for French.
[04:06.360 --> 04:06.800]  Oh, he's right.
[04:07.300 --> 04:07.660]  All right.
[04:08.260 --> 04:08.740]  Ace jump.
[04:09.000 --> 04:09.720]  Oh, well, all right.
[04:09.900 --> 04:12.840]  I was hoping, I was hoping this game could be over as soon as it started.
[04:14.940 --> 04:15.640]  Axe throws.
[04:16.180 --> 04:17.200]  Don't forget your flower.
[04:17.380 --> 04:18.680]  A flower for Sophie.
[04:19.440 --> 04:21.720]  I could tell already Eric loves this.
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.100]  You fucking dork.
[04:23.280 --> 04:25.700]  You gotta give your girlfriend a flower, you loser.
[04:26.100 --> 04:26.440]  Hang on.
[04:26.620 --> 04:27.060]  I have to.
[04:27.480 --> 04:27.760]  Can I?
[04:27.960 --> 04:28.840]  Is there a pause?
[04:29.300 --> 04:29.480]  Yeah.
[04:29.920 --> 04:30.460]  Hang on.
[04:31.160 --> 04:32.260]  Is there motion blur?
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.580]  Can I turn that shit off?
[04:34.420 --> 04:35.000]  Graphics maybe?
[04:36.060 --> 04:37.020]  Oh, thank God.
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.000]  Get out of here.
[04:38.000 --> 04:38.600]  I hate that shit.
[04:39.140 --> 04:39.580]  Hey, Gavin.
[04:39.740 --> 04:40.260]  Up to you.
[04:40.580 --> 04:40.840]  Get rid of it.
[04:41.460 --> 04:41.920]  All right.
[04:42.000 --> 04:42.540]  You got it, buddy.
[04:43.820 --> 04:46.420]  Can I ask for no vignettes then while we're at it?
[04:46.420 --> 04:46.560]  Yeah.
[04:46.780 --> 04:46.920]  Yeah.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.960]  What if we all have an optical hatred?
[04:52.300 --> 04:52.660]  What?
[04:52.780 --> 04:55.160]  I just don't understand the pointless vignette.
[04:55.360 --> 04:57.120]  Nick, you can turn something.
[04:57.300 --> 04:58.940]  You can make an adjustment here.
[04:59.020 --> 04:59.620]  What would you like?
[05:01.840 --> 05:02.160]  I'm good.
[05:02.600 --> 05:04.320]  You sure you don't want to change the contrast at all?
[05:04.700 --> 05:05.540]  What about film grain?
[05:06.220 --> 05:06.860]  That one's still going.
[05:06.920 --> 05:09.860]  I thought maybe you would turn chromatic aberration back on.
[05:10.060 --> 05:11.700]  I don't know what it does.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.580]  So you have to know what it does to be able to turn it off or on.
[05:14.660 --> 05:14.900]  Yes.
[05:14.900 --> 05:16.760]  What the fuck?
[05:16.900 --> 05:17.780]  She's really fast.
[05:18.140 --> 05:19.780]  She does not want that flower.
[05:19.780 --> 05:21.120]  I'm just trying to give you a flower.
[05:21.560 --> 05:21.760]  That's insane.
[05:21.760 --> 05:22.460]  That's your sister.
[05:22.760 --> 05:23.900]  That's not who the flower's for.
[05:25.220 --> 05:25.580]  Oh.
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.880]  This isn't like a Luke and Leia weirdo thing?
[05:28.420 --> 05:28.560]  No.
[05:28.620 --> 05:29.120]  No, it is.
[05:29.280 --> 05:29.820]  You know it is.
[05:30.000 --> 05:30.040]  Yeah.
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.100]  I'm looking over here to see if I can pick up like a sword or an ether or a phoenix down
[05:35.100 --> 05:35.480]  or something.
[05:38.080 --> 05:39.080]  Oh, Andrew, look.
[05:39.160 --> 05:39.400]  Opera.
[05:40.280 --> 05:40.680]  Opera.
[05:41.660 --> 05:42.060]  Opera.
[05:42.500 --> 05:42.700]  Opera.
[05:42.700 --> 05:42.740]  Opera.
[05:42.820 --> 05:43.000]  Opera.
[05:43.060 --> 05:43.400]  Opera.
[05:43.400 --> 05:43.500]  Opera.
[05:43.500 --> 05:43.520]  Opera.
[05:43.520 --> 05:43.540]  Opera.
[05:43.540 --> 05:43.820]  Opera.
[05:44.260 --> 05:45.620]  Oh, my God.
[05:45.820 --> 05:46.040]  There you go.
[05:46.300 --> 05:46.660]  Kissed, right?
[05:46.760 --> 05:47.560]  They didn't do anything else.
[05:49.100 --> 05:49.500]  Probably.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.460]  But yeah, I mean, a lot a lot happened between films, I think.
[05:53.800 --> 05:54.000]  Yeah.
[05:54.160 --> 05:55.400]  A cheeky finger behind the bins.
[05:55.780 --> 05:56.060]  Yeah.
[05:56.120 --> 05:56.280]  Yeah.
[05:56.280 --> 05:56.400]  Yeah.
[05:56.400 --> 05:56.640]  Close.
[05:59.460 --> 06:01.060]  Well, probably the back to tanks.
[06:01.480 --> 06:02.120]  But yeah.
[06:02.500 --> 06:03.180]  Cheeky finger.
[06:03.280 --> 06:03.980]  I'm going to catch you.
[06:04.340 --> 06:05.580]  I'm going to fucking catch you.
[06:05.840 --> 06:08.540]  I want to change the subject here.
[06:08.640 --> 06:08.800]  Yeah.
[06:08.820 --> 06:09.860]  How do we get out of this faster?
[06:10.100 --> 06:10.720]  Oh, roof piano.
[06:10.980 --> 06:11.340]  Nice.
[06:12.320 --> 06:13.020]  Roof horse.
[06:13.520 --> 06:13.920]  Wow.
[06:13.980 --> 06:15.240]  The future is bright.
[06:15.400 --> 06:16.760]  Is there like...
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.560]  But I don't understand.
[06:17.680 --> 06:18.860]  There's like a ton of stuff down here.
[06:18.940 --> 06:19.940]  Why is the horse on the roof?
[06:20.080 --> 06:22.040]  Because this is Assassin's Creed in France.
[06:22.820 --> 06:23.540]  Oh, man.
[06:23.680 --> 06:24.400]  Azazu Creed.
[06:26.460 --> 06:29.260]  I can't believe Sophie already turned 33.
[06:30.040 --> 06:30.200]  Wow.
[06:30.320 --> 06:30.500]  Damn.
[06:30.580 --> 06:30.980]  She old.
[06:31.100 --> 06:33.000]  The great Larry Bird jersey 33.
[06:34.060 --> 06:35.120]  She looks so much younger.
[06:35.960 --> 06:38.520]  I'm sure she already has a necklace full of flowers.
[06:38.520 --> 06:42.420]  It's weird that you move super fast and cool over the jumps, but not when you're running.
[06:46.800 --> 06:47.600]  What's the...
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.560]  We just ran on rooftops.
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.160]  Giant tentacles in the background.
[06:51.260 --> 06:51.780]  What's going on there?
[06:55.000 --> 06:57.160]  I need to kick your fucking ass.
[06:58.440 --> 06:59.580]  She wants to duel.
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.360]  Yeah, you need to get into a fight first.
[07:05.000 --> 07:05.580]  Loosen up.
[07:06.180 --> 07:07.560]  His hand is clipping through his clothes.
[07:07.560 --> 07:08.020]  That's weird.
[07:10.760 --> 07:12.120]  Whoa, my Lumina converter?
[07:12.420 --> 07:13.940]  You're not supposed to know about that.
[07:14.240 --> 07:15.440]  People are stealing those lately.
[07:16.660 --> 07:19.760]  Do you wish to go through the battle tutorial for this duel?
[07:19.860 --> 07:21.500]  Andrew, do you want me to go through the battle tutorial?
[07:22.100 --> 07:23.700]  It's probably useful to you.
[07:25.580 --> 07:28.500]  That's about as much yes as I was going to get out of Andrew.
[07:28.700 --> 07:29.760]  Oh, look at that sword.
[07:29.940 --> 07:30.780]  Oh, you're going to hate this.
[07:32.480 --> 07:34.340]  Okay, I'm not reading this shit.
[07:34.980 --> 07:36.760]  Turn by turn, try attack.
[07:36.920 --> 07:37.580]  Very simplistic.
[07:38.020 --> 07:38.800]  You got it.
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.500]  What number game is this in this series?
[07:44.300 --> 07:44.800]  Or is it not?
[07:44.980 --> 07:45.420]  The first.
[07:45.900 --> 07:46.300]  33.
[07:47.300 --> 07:48.980]  You didn't play 1 through 32, Gavin?
[07:50.140 --> 07:54.100]  I pressed the button and it was like, it'll pause me.
[07:54.340 --> 07:55.640]  Come on, just let me hit this person.
[07:56.620 --> 07:57.120]  Skill wheel.
[07:57.840 --> 07:58.660]  I love skills.
[07:59.020 --> 07:59.920]  Skill wheel.
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.380]  Alright, which one do you want me to do, Nick?
[08:03.380 --> 08:04.480]  You're fucking overcharged.
[08:04.680 --> 08:06.240]  Alright, they won't let me.
[08:06.580 --> 08:07.300]  I have to do the...
[08:07.300 --> 08:07.760]  Lumiere Assault then.
[08:08.120 --> 08:09.840]  I have to do the...
[08:10.260 --> 08:13.300]  This is like the candle from Beauty and the Beast, right?
[08:13.320 --> 08:16.560]  Yeah, remember when they got famous French actor Ewan McGregor to play?
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.160]  Gotta hit the A when it's in the golden area.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.160]  Right.
[08:25.580 --> 08:26.000]  Ooh, parry.
[08:26.680 --> 08:27.120]  Parry!
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.440]  Parry!
[08:30.540 --> 08:31.960]  You're parrying in parry.
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.080]  Hi-fucking-ya!
[08:37.580 --> 08:39.140]  Now you can overcharge.
[08:39.540 --> 08:40.080]  Oh, thank god.
[08:40.580 --> 08:40.820]  Alright, Geoff.
[08:41.360 --> 08:42.440]  Alright, Geoff, this is just for you.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.260]  Thanks, man.
[08:45.060 --> 08:47.500]  Make the target be your sister and then destroy her.
[08:48.420 --> 08:49.080]  Oh, I see.
[08:49.280 --> 08:49.600]  Okay.
[08:50.180 --> 08:51.340]  God has given me with the gift.
[08:51.360 --> 08:52.400]  I thought it just stayed there.
[08:52.500 --> 08:53.380]  There's like a...
[08:53.980 --> 08:55.480]  There's a movement element to it.
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.040]  We continue.
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.320]  A button was we continue.
[08:58.360 --> 08:58.640]  Yeah.
[08:59.040 --> 08:59.620]  I feel better.
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.280]  I got the color of Lumiere.
[09:02.300 --> 09:04.060]  How does she know she lost?
[09:05.740 --> 09:06.940]  You kicked the shit out of me.
[09:07.000 --> 09:07.500]  I've had enough.
[09:07.560 --> 09:08.640]  She got overcharged.
[09:09.240 --> 09:09.880]  I give.
[09:10.060 --> 09:10.360]  I give.
[09:11.880 --> 09:12.500]  Jump down.
[09:12.780 --> 09:15.540]  Only you can be overcharged, Gavin, and declare it a win.
[09:19.200 --> 09:20.080]  Whoa, Jesus.
[09:20.980 --> 09:22.480]  Do you think the floor is lava?
[09:23.220 --> 09:23.940]  Yeah, definitely.
[09:24.200 --> 09:27.240]  It feels like there should be stuff to find up here, but I don't think I care enough to find it.
[09:28.380 --> 09:28.740]  That...
[09:28.740 --> 09:29.020]  Don't worry.
[09:29.020 --> 09:29.620]  The floor is lava.
[09:30.060 --> 09:30.860]  Sorry, go ahead, Nick.
[09:31.020 --> 09:31.320]  No, no.
[09:31.400 --> 09:36.580]  I was going to say, floor is lava would be so much more fun if you had the ability to rip yourself across an open chasm.
[09:37.420 --> 09:37.800]  Yes.
[09:38.040 --> 09:38.600]  Grappling hooks?
[09:39.020 --> 09:39.400]  Yeah.
[09:44.360 --> 09:52.560]  I feel like if I ever tried to use a grappling hook in even a semi-horizontal fashion, I would bunk my head and my knees on everything.
[09:53.140 --> 09:53.460]  We should.
[09:53.860 --> 09:55.720]  Bunk, bunk, bunk all the way across.
[09:56.260 --> 09:57.080]  It'd be so painful.
[10:00.320 --> 10:02.340]  Lower half is just a big bruise.
[10:02.400 --> 10:02.640]  Yeah.
[10:04.180 --> 10:06.560]  And you're telling me these people are in their 30s?
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.000]  Dressing like this?
[10:09.060 --> 10:09.980]  They dress like dickheads.
[10:10.680 --> 10:10.980]  Yeah.
[10:14.240 --> 10:16.900]  This is more like 22-year-old fashion, dude.
[10:17.320 --> 10:18.460]  Oh, yeah, I'm wearing a beret.
[10:19.040 --> 10:21.640]  Some real Cinderella haircut from the new movie.
[10:22.180 --> 10:22.740]  Can we talk?
[10:28.300 --> 10:31.540]  This is exactly how Juliet and Romeo started.
[10:31.900 --> 10:32.260]  Whoa!
[10:32.940 --> 10:34.220]  Then they're going to start singing and dancing?
[10:34.400 --> 10:34.780]  That's awesome.
[10:34.940 --> 10:36.000]  In three days, they'll all be dead.
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.280]  Eric, you get 10 grand, but you have to wear a beret for a year.
[10:40.040 --> 10:40.980]  For a year?
[10:41.120 --> 10:41.880]  For 10 grand?
[10:44.960 --> 10:46.560]  I think Eric's a little off the break.
[10:47.160 --> 10:49.320]  Yeah, but it's like a little low for a year.
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.140]  Because I'm not just thinking about like...
[10:52.500 --> 10:54.580]  I'm not just thinking about like, oh, I'm going out.
[10:54.860 --> 10:56.440]  Like, we're going to go drinking, whatever.
[10:56.620 --> 10:57.840]  It's like, I have to go to the doctor.
[10:58.100 --> 11:00.060]  And it's like, why are you wearing this?
[11:00.800 --> 11:01.640]  You know what I mean?
[11:01.740 --> 11:04.300]  But it's like 30 bucks a day if you break it down, right?
[11:05.020 --> 11:05.760]  It's not bad.
[11:07.160 --> 11:08.400]  What about when he sleeps?
[11:09.320 --> 11:10.040]  Can you take it off?
[11:10.760 --> 11:12.260]  Do I get like a sleep beret?
[11:12.440 --> 11:15.560]  Is it just like a going out beret?
[11:15.740 --> 11:17.940]  Like as soon as he leaves the house, he puts it on kind of thing?
[11:18.060 --> 11:19.880]  No, it just comes on with the rest of his clothes.
[11:20.620 --> 11:21.020]  Oh.
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.240]  That's a magic beret.
[11:23.640 --> 11:26.340]  Anytime he decides to be naked, he doesn't have to wear it.
[11:26.680 --> 11:26.820]  Yeah.
[11:27.020 --> 11:28.640]  No, he especially has to wear it then.
[11:30.020 --> 11:30.800]  All right.
[11:31.040 --> 11:31.220]  All right.
[11:31.220 --> 11:34.380]  We're getting into some more like Nick fetish area.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.180]  I don't know about that.
[11:35.240 --> 11:35.640]  Oh, yeah.
[11:35.840 --> 11:36.520]  I like hats.
[11:36.900 --> 11:38.280]  Saturdays at Gavin's pool.
[11:38.440 --> 11:39.380]  Does the beret on?
[11:40.420 --> 11:40.660]  Yeah.
[11:41.220 --> 11:42.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[11:42.220 --> 11:42.900]  Because he's got the swimmies.
[11:42.960 --> 11:43.920]  Got the trunks on.
[11:44.060 --> 11:44.160]  Yeah.
[11:44.740 --> 11:45.100]  All right.
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.540]  You want to protect your head?
[11:47.440 --> 11:48.060]  Yeah, great.
[11:49.640 --> 11:50.740]  How's your nose doing, bud?
[11:51.900 --> 11:52.640]  Not you, Gavin.
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.100]  I was asking.
[11:53.580 --> 11:53.720]  Oh.
[11:58.300 --> 11:59.620]  That kid seemed disturbed.
[12:01.540 --> 12:03.540]  It's not a great day in their culture.
[12:04.440 --> 12:04.680]  Oh.
[12:05.060 --> 12:05.380]  Oh.
[12:05.980 --> 12:06.640]  How do you know so much?
[12:06.800 --> 12:07.320]  Is it because she's wearing the beret?
[12:07.500 --> 12:07.660]  Yeah.
[12:07.780 --> 12:08.240]  How do you know?
[12:08.640 --> 12:09.900]  You're a Claire Obscura guy?
[12:10.120 --> 12:10.520]  I am.
[12:10.580 --> 12:10.860]  You already beat this game?
[12:11.580 --> 12:13.300]  No, I'm pretty far in.
[12:13.940 --> 12:15.200]  Did you play 1 through 32?
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.180]  Yeah, I did.
[12:18.420 --> 12:19.280]  This is the best one.
[12:20.200 --> 12:22.000]  Stubborn people change the world.
[12:22.540 --> 12:24.880]  And you are the most stubborn person.
[12:24.880 --> 12:26.160]  Eric, you're going to change the world.
[12:27.000 --> 12:27.740]  That's the goal.
[12:27.860 --> 12:33.120]  This looks like it's about to become Bioshock 3.
[12:34.040 --> 12:34.800]  Oh, yeah, it does.
[12:35.000 --> 12:35.160]  Yeah.
[12:35.920 --> 12:36.420]  Oh, yeah.
[12:36.520 --> 12:37.060]  That's a good call.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.060]  I didn't think about that.
[12:38.100 --> 12:39.300]  It definitely has that feel.
[12:39.900 --> 12:43.020]  So, it's like underwater, in the air.
[12:43.280 --> 12:43.640]  Yes.
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.440]  Now, Bioshock 3 is just land.
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.480]  This looks like you're rescuing her from whatever that little, like the big monster is or whatever.
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.160]  And she's going to do like the time rift.
[12:56.320 --> 12:56.740]  Big daddy.
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.680]  Yeah, you can heal a horse and listen to Tears for Fears.
[13:02.800 --> 13:03.900]  That's what I remember from that game.
[13:03.900 --> 13:06.580]  So, you switched clothes and now you're running around in the girl's clothes?
[13:07.180 --> 13:08.180]  Yeah, I'm the girl now.
[13:09.140 --> 13:09.560]  Wahoo!
[13:09.980 --> 13:10.700]  You're still here?
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.820]  Get away from me.
[13:13.020 --> 13:13.720]  Go away.
[13:13.900 --> 13:14.340]  Stop.
[13:14.600 --> 13:15.920]  I don't want to give you my number.
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.300]  What's all that goo shit?
[13:18.700 --> 13:19.060]  Flour?
[13:19.280 --> 13:19.460]  Oh.
[13:19.880 --> 13:21.120]  I thought you were talking about the flowers.
[13:23.060 --> 13:24.220]  What are you talking about?
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.880]  No, the weird, like, tentacle growth stuff.
[13:26.360 --> 13:27.520]  It looks pretty solid though.
[13:27.540 --> 13:28.340]  I don't think it's gooey.
[13:28.960 --> 13:29.080]  Oh.
[13:29.920 --> 13:30.940]  What's all the solid goo?
[13:32.140 --> 13:33.640]  I bet if you get it wet, it gets gooey.
[13:34.040 --> 13:34.680]  Yeah, I'll bet so.
[13:34.920 --> 13:35.040]  It's like mud.
[13:35.040 --> 13:35.440]  You might be right.
[13:35.960 --> 13:36.760]  Dirt on mud, you know?
[13:37.960 --> 13:38.680]  Dirt on mud.
[13:38.680 --> 13:39.720]  They're heading to the harbor, guys.
[13:40.560 --> 13:40.900]  David?
[13:43.920 --> 13:44.940]  It's coming up a little early.
[13:49.100 --> 13:50.740]  Never seen Tiffany with IE.
[13:51.420 --> 13:51.800]  Nuh-uh.
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.900]  It's French, but she's Irish?
[13:54.340 --> 13:54.960]  French-Irish.
[13:56.820 --> 13:58.640]  That's probably, like, a common thing in Europe, though.
[13:58.780 --> 14:00.920]  Like, that sounds crazy to us, but that's probably, like, so normal.
[14:03.460 --> 14:03.700]  Yeah.
[14:03.800 --> 14:04.380]  Is there anything over here?
[14:04.660 --> 14:04.940]  Yeah!
[14:06.340 --> 14:07.640]  I got Roma!
[14:09.140 --> 14:09.860]  Let me in.
[14:09.860 --> 14:10.980]  Let me in!
[14:11.100 --> 14:12.840]  Where's the rest of the tick aberration?
[14:14.120 --> 14:15.080]  I turned it off.
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.400]  That would be in the corners.
[14:18.480 --> 14:20.960]  Hidden by the vignette.
[14:21.500 --> 14:22.040]  Trash can.
[14:22.920 --> 14:24.060]  It's just a trash can.
[14:24.200 --> 14:24.700]  Knock it over.
[14:25.320 --> 14:25.740]  Knock it over.
[14:26.160 --> 14:27.820]  It might be a portal to a new adventure.
[14:28.520 --> 14:28.900]  Hang on.
[14:29.200 --> 14:30.120]  What about this one?
[14:30.700 --> 14:31.480]  Oh, this one even looks...
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.440]  It's not just a trash can.
[14:32.700 --> 14:33.900]  Yeah, it's more than a trash can.
[14:34.840 --> 14:35.820]  It's nothing to you.
[14:36.400 --> 14:38.240]  This is not even a trash can.
[14:38.260 --> 14:39.320]  Oscar the Grouch pops out.
[14:39.320 --> 14:40.740]  They're plasmids.
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.980]  Like, man, it looks very much like it's about to become Columbia or whatever that is.
[14:46.980 --> 14:49.300]  Throw a coin to the dude in slow motion.
[14:51.560 --> 14:52.400]  Heads again.
[14:52.680 --> 14:53.200]  Oh, man.
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.600]  That's a coin to the Frenchman.
[14:56.320 --> 14:56.740]  Look around.
[14:57.400 --> 14:57.740]  There you go.
[14:58.240 --> 14:58.820]  Oh, look.
[14:58.980 --> 14:59.900]  He's doing stuff with it.
[14:59.900 --> 15:00.480]  See, it's not gooey.
[15:00.560 --> 15:00.960]  It's hard.
[15:01.980 --> 15:02.500]  Hit me.
[15:02.620 --> 15:02.980]  Hit me.
[15:03.080 --> 15:03.900]  33 is too long.
[15:04.020 --> 15:04.260]  Hit me.
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.480]  So, is everyone above 33 already gone?
[15:08.000 --> 15:08.320]  Yes.
[15:09.340 --> 15:10.860]  So, these are the oldest people.
[15:11.260 --> 15:12.620]  These are the oldest people, yes.
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.320]  Is it just because everybody died or is it a situation like where they round you up when the crystal in your hand lights up and then they kill you?
[15:19.980 --> 15:20.700]  It's kind of both.
[15:21.020 --> 15:21.900]  Like Logan's run.
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.420]  A little bit of both.
[15:23.440 --> 15:23.980]  This is Logan.
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.140]  Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.
[15:25.240 --> 15:27.480]  Man, retirement would be so much easier in this world.
[15:27.780 --> 15:28.140]  Yeah.
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.140]  So, if it's like a leap year, does two years worth of people die?
[15:32.560 --> 15:33.580]  Oh, that's a great question.
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.020]  Oh, shit.
[15:34.540 --> 15:36.260]  That's like, oh, I'm actually only seven.
[15:36.260 --> 15:38.220]  Oh, yeah.
[15:38.240 --> 15:39.240]  What if that's the loophole?
[15:39.340 --> 15:40.600]  You get to live forever in a leap year.
[15:43.520 --> 15:44.000]  Ouch.
[15:44.680 --> 15:45.020]  Damn.
[15:45.220 --> 15:47.340]  What a bitch.
[15:47.940 --> 15:48.700]  You don't have children.
[15:49.460 --> 15:51.220]  You'll be dead soon, lady.
[15:53.900 --> 15:54.380]  Jesus.
[15:54.580 --> 15:55.280]  Jesus Christ.
[16:02.540 --> 16:04.300]  This is how I talk to Geoff.
[16:06.260 --> 16:06.440]  Easy.
[16:07.200 --> 16:09.100]  I'd like to spend this moment with him.
[16:09.860 --> 16:10.300]  Bitch.
[16:10.580 --> 16:11.960]  You should cherish this.
[16:13.140 --> 16:13.580]  Sorry.
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.140]  No, you're not.
[16:15.280 --> 16:16.040]  See you at the harbor.
[16:16.420 --> 16:16.740]  Shut up.
[16:17.180 --> 16:17.960]  See you at the graveyard.
[16:21.200 --> 16:23.340]  I hope everything ever ends.
[16:23.720 --> 16:24.280]  This is pretty good.
[16:24.500 --> 16:24.720]  Sweet.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.360]  I heard there's a new Hellboy.
[16:26.880 --> 16:27.880]  Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
[16:33.590 --> 16:36.270]  You ever think about when a word could be two different things?
[16:36.570 --> 16:38.090]  Like a harbor or David Harbor?
[16:38.310 --> 16:38.490]  No.
[16:38.970 --> 16:39.230]  No?
[16:39.970 --> 16:40.970]  How about you, Andrew?
[16:41.190 --> 16:41.410]  Nope.
[16:41.730 --> 16:42.470]  I don't get the reference.
[16:43.030 --> 16:44.450]  That's a great point, Geoff.
[16:45.290 --> 16:47.190]  I wonder if there are any other examples of that.
[16:48.390 --> 16:52.250]  Possibly in Gears of War videos that are going to come out 18 years from now.
[16:52.290 --> 16:53.010]  No, that already came out.
[16:53.010 --> 16:53.570]  It's already out.
[16:54.750 --> 16:55.490]  Oh, is that one out?
[16:55.750 --> 16:56.390]  That one's out.
[16:57.730 --> 16:58.870]  Which part was that one?
[16:59.130 --> 17:02.390]  I had to proof it and I just had to live through it all again.
[17:10.750 --> 17:12.750]  This sculpture sucks ass.
[17:13.230 --> 17:14.390]  What do you like about it?
[17:15.590 --> 17:15.990]  Everything.
[17:16.550 --> 17:17.410]  I like the legs.
[17:17.630 --> 17:18.410]  Little pointy feet.
[17:18.950 --> 17:19.970]  Yeah, those are my little drills.
[17:20.410 --> 17:22.510]  Like the Big Daddy drills for legs.
[17:22.710 --> 17:22.790]  Yeah.
[17:23.410 --> 17:24.010]  Oh my god.
[17:24.010 --> 17:25.590]  Perhaps you could paint it ice concealer.
[17:26.430 --> 17:26.990]  Yeah.
[17:27.230 --> 17:29.730]  Maybe sculpt something more menacing.
[17:29.950 --> 17:30.910]  That's what you should do.
[17:31.010 --> 17:32.150]  Like add some Nevron.
[17:34.650 --> 17:37.250]  Why does it look like Oogie Boogie from...
[17:37.850 --> 17:39.250]  That's exactly what it looks like.
[17:39.590 --> 17:41.430]  I'm the Oogie Boogie man.
[17:41.630 --> 17:42.330]  Alright, cool man.
[17:43.370 --> 17:44.490]  Oh my god!
[17:46.270 --> 17:47.410]  Let me die!
[17:51.390 --> 17:52.990]  Let me die already.
[17:52.990 --> 17:53.850]  Let's run to the harbor.
[17:54.410 --> 17:55.190]  Where's the harbor?
[17:55.590 --> 17:56.610]  The other way.
[17:58.190 --> 17:59.970]  Towards the opening probably.
[18:01.310 --> 18:02.050]  Let's keep running down.
[18:02.430 --> 18:03.430]  Look for the water.
[18:04.410 --> 18:05.570]  But I have to talk to these kids.
[18:07.330 --> 18:09.710]  The future is pretty dark it looks like.
[18:09.830 --> 18:10.450]  It's bleak.
[18:10.850 --> 18:12.430]  It's like they're upside down the masks.
[18:12.610 --> 18:13.290]  Chicken Jockey!
[18:15.690 --> 18:17.110]  Of course they do.
[18:17.590 --> 18:19.390]  Hell yeah, I'm about to die. I'll tell you anything.
[18:21.070 --> 18:24.070]  You better hope you do it before you turn 33.
[18:24.170 --> 18:25.630]  How does he know you're there?
[18:26.730 --> 18:28.710]  There's no holes or anything.
[18:29.190 --> 18:32.170]  His fucking stupid brother looks like an idiot too.
[18:36.850 --> 18:38.850]  Oh for god's sake.
[18:41.690 --> 18:42.710]  Hell yeah.
[18:47.350 --> 18:48.450]  Or a Nevron.
[18:49.610 --> 18:51.290]  Not menacing enough.
[18:51.830 --> 18:53.550]  What's up dogs? Stop hanging out with little kids.
[18:54.830 --> 18:56.350]  Hey Geoff, no deal.
[18:57.010 --> 18:58.670]  Just go to the fucking water.
[18:59.450 --> 19:00.130]  Back here?
[19:00.290 --> 19:01.130]  Go to the David Harbor.
[19:01.650 --> 19:02.230]  Over here?
[19:03.290 --> 19:03.650]  Maybe.
[19:05.550 --> 19:07.130]  Go to the David Harbor.
[19:07.750 --> 19:08.390]  Expedition.
[19:10.730 --> 19:12.410]  You chose that!
[19:13.610 --> 19:14.570]  They're volunteering.
[19:15.110 --> 19:18.210]  Oh dude, people are volunteering to go down?
[19:18.550 --> 19:19.050]  What's happening?
[19:19.590 --> 19:23.450]  Well they have to try to keep getting recruits for every expedition they do.
[19:24.670 --> 19:26.490]  Nah, this fucking idiot's still here.
[19:31.260 --> 19:32.620]  I don't care!
[19:32.960 --> 19:33.800]  Take me to David Harbor.
[19:33.960 --> 19:35.760]  There's so many flowers in the future.
[19:35.820 --> 19:37.000]  What's everybody pissed about?
[19:37.900 --> 19:38.380]  Beautiful.
[19:38.580 --> 19:39.980]  Probably dying at 34.
[19:40.260 --> 19:41.700]  Boom, I want to tell you what to paint.
[19:44.260 --> 19:44.900]  Shut up.
[19:45.800 --> 19:48.940]  You initiated, you can't immediately say shut up.
[19:49.360 --> 19:50.080]  Shut up.
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.100]  Get to it.
[19:52.160 --> 19:52.720]  Get to it.
[19:53.220 --> 19:54.220]  Give me a choice.
[19:58.060 --> 19:58.980]  Andrew, you hear that?
[19:59.740 --> 20:01.000]  This is my guy.
[20:02.300 --> 20:03.580]  Why is he dressed like a Ringling brother?
[20:06.220 --> 20:07.420]  That's the future, Nick.
[20:07.940 --> 20:08.160]  Damn.
[20:09.840 --> 20:11.940]  What the fuck is going on?
[20:17.220 --> 20:18.660]  Wait, so you're the other guy again?
[20:20.740 --> 20:21.480]  You got hit.
[20:22.800 --> 20:25.260]  Don't let the painter go uninspired.
[20:27.200 --> 20:28.680]  Is this like a muse fight?
[20:29.580 --> 20:29.780]  Yeah.
[20:32.620 --> 20:33.720]  Oh, I see.
[20:34.100 --> 20:34.640]  Got it.
[20:34.880 --> 20:35.320]  He sees.
[20:37.640 --> 20:39.620]  I see it, I see it all now.
[20:41.320 --> 20:43.480]  One last time and you'll inspire the painter.
[20:48.300 --> 20:50.360]  Well, that was like four more times, hopefully it did it.
[20:50.500 --> 20:51.860]  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff, I inspired the painter.
[20:52.660 --> 20:54.540]  Dude, you got 25 battle loot from yourself.
[20:54.640 --> 20:56.040]  37 seconds, you'll never get back.
[20:56.220 --> 20:56.840]  I'll take that.
[20:56.840 --> 21:00.080]  You took it from the right pocket and threw it in your left pocket and you were like, judging.
[21:00.680 --> 21:02.860]  Wow, look at that, Andrew, isn't that gorgeous?
[21:03.220 --> 21:03.860]  That's beautiful.
[21:04.120 --> 21:06.080]  Doesn't look like any of the fighting you just did.
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.220]  Looks like you're holding hands.
[21:07.560 --> 21:09.460]  What are you talking about? That's how we fought, isn't it?
[21:10.280 --> 21:12.060]  It is I who should thank you.
[21:12.060 --> 21:12.700]  It is I.
[21:13.320 --> 21:15.000]  I want Nick to wear a hat like this.
[21:15.040 --> 21:17.180]  Nick, $20,000 for a year you wear a hat like that.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.660]  You know what that hat would go well with?
[21:19.260 --> 21:20.880]  A pair of big red boots.
[21:23.060 --> 21:25.080]  Oh, look at the painting, that's good.
[21:25.780 --> 21:27.520]  That's what I'm saying, it's gorgeous, beautiful.
[21:29.600 --> 21:32.720]  Yeah, it wasn't that impressive. We actually suck shit, fucking idiot.
[21:37.040 --> 21:37.900]  We're just friends.
[21:38.720 --> 21:40.180]  Okay, stop talking. Recoat.
[21:40.360 --> 21:42.440]  Oh, Andrew didn't even get recoat when he played this game.
[21:42.440 --> 21:44.660]  I can tell. I can tell.
[21:44.880 --> 21:47.440]  I didn't interact with any of these people, I ran straight to the barber.
[21:47.600 --> 21:49.120]  That doesn't surprise me at all.
[21:49.780 --> 21:52.500]  Are you not really like an environment guy, Andrew?
[21:53.700 --> 21:58.480]  Uh, typically I am, but in the context of this, I was like, I should probably just get to the barber.
[21:59.560 --> 22:01.000]  Why? Then you didn't get the recoat.
[22:01.280 --> 22:01.720]  Yeah, I know.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.260]  He knew that you're one of those guys that hits every X, so he knew he'd be going through it later.
[22:07.420 --> 22:08.860]  That's a good point, Geoff.
[22:09.600 --> 22:11.220]  It killed me to skip so many.
[22:12.760 --> 22:15.020]  There's so much to explore. Oh, there he is, David Harbour.
[22:18.580 --> 22:19.180]  David!
[22:20.080 --> 22:22.400]  Oh, Victor. Victor Harbour.
[22:22.680 --> 22:25.000]  I'm always mistaking Victor for David.
[22:32.340 --> 22:32.940]  Okay.
[22:35.980 --> 22:36.580]  Okay.
[22:37.800 --> 22:38.200]  Okay.
[22:40.120 --> 22:42.440]  So he's like a Cockney guy, but it's France?
[22:43.220 --> 22:44.340]  It's not really France.
[22:46.420 --> 22:47.220]  I disagree.
[22:48.580 --> 22:49.380]  It's Lumiere.
[22:50.080 --> 22:50.780]  It's France.
[22:50.900 --> 22:51.800]  Which is a French word.
[22:53.720 --> 22:57.360]  Oh, Andrew didn't even go over here and get this.
[22:57.360 --> 22:58.600]  I didn't. No, I missed this.
[22:58.720 --> 22:58.820]  Yeah.
[22:58.980 --> 22:59.380]  Chroma?
[22:59.440 --> 23:00.120]  You got more Chroma.
[23:00.340 --> 23:01.340]  I got more Chroma, bitch.
[23:02.660 --> 23:03.860]  I'm a Chroma explorer.
[23:04.500 --> 23:05.000]  There it is.
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.140]  You're a real Chroma head.
[23:07.200 --> 23:08.560]  No, this isn't where we're supposed to go.
[23:08.900 --> 23:10.100]  So who put the number up there?
[23:11.900 --> 23:12.220]  God.
[23:15.960 --> 23:17.300]  Oh, there's something happening over there.
[23:17.640 --> 23:18.460]  Yeah, there's some weird...
[23:19.240 --> 23:19.260]  Hang on.
[23:20.280 --> 23:22.020]  Hang on, I wanna check out Nick and his wife.
[23:25.520 --> 23:28.500]  Nick, $30,000, you grow facial hair like that and wear that hat for a year.
[23:30.120 --> 23:31.720]  You're gonna have to learn how to use devil sticks.
[23:33.640 --> 23:36.820]  You gotta use a fushigi ball and get good at it.
[23:38.520 --> 23:39.640]  I'd think about it.
[23:39.700 --> 23:41.420]  I hope you like carnival music.
[23:42.580 --> 23:45.680]  This is so much more inspiring than the fighting that we did.
[23:46.700 --> 23:49.340]  It's definitely inspiring frame rate problems.
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.080]  Yeah, what's happening with the judder?
[23:52.260 --> 23:52.980]  I think that's...
[23:52.980 --> 23:53.700]  It's on him.
[23:53.740 --> 23:57.000]  I think it's just on... I think it's just what's being shared to you.
[23:57.080 --> 23:57.920]  This is too much Chroma.
[23:58.240 --> 23:58.520]  Oh.
[23:58.760 --> 23:58.920]  Yeah.
[23:59.160 --> 23:59.520]  Yeah.
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.500]  It's because I turned off chromatic abrasion and it would have helped.
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.740]  Chroma overwhelming.
[24:05.140 --> 24:05.560]  Abrasion.
[24:06.740 --> 24:08.200]  You've abraded my chrome.
[24:08.580 --> 24:08.800]  Yeah.
[24:09.080 --> 24:09.760]  The paintress.
[24:11.680 --> 24:13.360]  Oh, is she the murderess?
[24:13.620 --> 24:16.500]  She's the murderess painter of numbers.
[24:17.040 --> 24:18.720]  And she's gonna exfoliate everyone?
[24:19.320 --> 24:21.620]  Oh, everybody is gonna get so exfoliated.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.020]  My pores never look better.
[24:29.520 --> 24:31.300]  We should start calling Gus, Gustav.
[24:31.820 --> 24:33.620]  Is that how you're supposed to... Is that like William?
[24:33.980 --> 24:35.480]  Alexander Gilm?
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.140]  Disgusting in my mouth.
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.900]  Gustav Sorolla.
[24:45.400 --> 24:46.800]  Good morning, Gustav.
[24:51.020 --> 24:52.280]  New season starts soon.
[24:52.280 --> 25:00.070]  I wanted to do something... for you.
[25:00.650 --> 25:02.550]  So I brought a bunch of little kids to annoy you.
[25:02.990 --> 25:03.210]  Yeah.
[25:04.010 --> 25:07.470]  Thanks, guys. This is... this is great. Thank you.
[25:08.190 --> 25:08.970]  Don't touch me with that hand.
[25:10.050 --> 25:11.510]  Don't leave without saying goodbye.
[25:11.870 --> 25:12.930]  I'll touch you with the cursed hand.
[25:14.490 --> 25:16.110]  That's what we just did. He just said goodbye.
[25:16.570 --> 25:17.290]  So I'm waving at you.
[25:17.530 --> 25:18.430]  Yeah, what did you think this was?
[25:20.230 --> 25:23.990]  Why don't I just say, don't leave without saying hello and then goodbye again.
[25:27.590 --> 25:29.410]  Gavin, if you grow your hair out, would it look like that?
[25:29.490 --> 25:31.750]  Whose hair would it look more like? Hers or his?
[25:33.390 --> 25:35.410]  I mean, you've seen me with long hair, haven't you?
[25:36.830 --> 25:38.390]  Not as long as they have.
[25:39.310 --> 25:40.250]  It's very straight.
[25:40.670 --> 25:43.570]  Yeah, it's from his teen lesbian phase, remember?
[25:43.750 --> 25:45.410]  Right, right. That's when you were pretty young, though.
[25:45.430 --> 25:46.690]  You don't think your hair's changed since then?
[25:46.690 --> 25:48.450]  Well, it was long in COVID.
[25:48.970 --> 25:49.110]  Yeah.
[25:50.570 --> 25:51.990]  I don't think I saw you during COVID.
[25:52.830 --> 25:53.130]  No.
[25:54.070 --> 25:55.230]  Neither did my hairdresser.
[26:00.970 --> 26:03.350]  The biggest mystery is always Andrew's hair.
[26:03.530 --> 26:05.030]  Like, what are we working with right now, Andrew?
[26:05.110 --> 26:05.930]  Oh, that's a great question.
[26:06.270 --> 26:06.370]  It's too long.
[26:07.590 --> 26:08.470]  Oh, yeah? Long hair.
[26:09.450 --> 26:10.550]  Like down to your ass?
[26:10.670 --> 26:10.850]  Ponytail?
[26:10.870 --> 26:12.050]  Not that long. No.
[26:12.330 --> 26:13.130]  Like shoulder length.
[26:13.770 --> 26:14.030]  Okay.
[26:14.230 --> 26:14.590]  Damn!
[26:14.670 --> 26:15.010]  Really?
[26:15.730 --> 26:17.250]  Like a 70s rocker?
[26:18.790 --> 26:19.590]  Yeah, not that one.
[26:19.590 --> 26:20.430]  You look like a 70s rocker.
[26:20.490 --> 26:23.130]  Do you have like a teased up Pat Benatar kind of thing going on?
[26:24.030 --> 26:27.550]  I don't know what Pat Benatar had going on, but sure.
[26:33.830 --> 26:34.230]  Wow.
[26:35.390 --> 26:36.510]  Do you think that was significant?
[26:39.170 --> 26:39.830]  Uh, sure.
[26:44.380 --> 26:46.120]  It'd be a really shitty day to sleep in.
[26:47.620 --> 26:49.600]  Oh, fuck, I missed it. What'd they put? Oh, no.
[26:49.600 --> 26:49.660]  Oh!
[26:52.320 --> 26:55.800]  So she just changes the number every year or what? How's that work?
[26:55.960 --> 26:57.200]  Yeah, and then like they die.
[27:05.700 --> 27:07.480]  Geoff just sent a great picture of Pat Benatar.
[27:07.820 --> 27:08.560]  That's kind of what I was thinking.
[27:09.280 --> 27:12.840]  I'll later on, I'll Photoshop your mustache on it.
[27:16.480 --> 27:17.620]  That was a weird cut.
[27:22.210 --> 27:22.650]  Damn.
[27:23.710 --> 27:25.230]  That's a dramatic piano.
[27:26.150 --> 27:27.290]  It's so orange here now.
[27:28.470 --> 27:31.010]  So we hate the painter? That's what's going on?
[27:31.290 --> 27:31.650]  We hate the painter.
[27:31.650 --> 27:33.590]  Well, we hate the paintress. I don't think we know the painter.
[27:33.850 --> 27:34.070]  I'm sorry.
[27:34.830 --> 27:36.410]  I didn't really care for the painter previous.
[27:37.390 --> 27:40.650]  I thought painter was like a neutral, like a gender neutral term.
[27:40.730 --> 27:42.930]  I hadn't thought of paintress as like a term for something.
[27:43.710 --> 27:44.950]  We've been cramming it on our throats.
[27:45.830 --> 27:47.670]  Yeah. Yeah, I'm like not really paying attention.
[27:48.430 --> 27:50.350]  Oh, you should. It's a rich and deep story.
[27:52.310 --> 27:53.030]  It's French.
[27:53.030 --> 27:53.090]  French.
[27:56.090 --> 28:02.290]  This dude, he paid her $10,000 to wear that beret every day for the last year of her life.
[28:02.770 --> 28:07.010]  It was his last year. He knew his last year of life, so he spent his money crazy style.
[28:07.250 --> 28:09.130]  Yo, wear this beret every day for a year, idiot.
[28:09.290 --> 28:10.630]  He's like, I don't do it for my 401k.
[28:11.070 --> 28:12.190]  Give me a beret, I'll do it.
[28:13.130 --> 28:14.350]  Wow, for 10k?
[28:14.830 --> 28:15.250]  Yeah, why not?
[28:17.070 --> 28:18.510]  Can you put up the 10k?
[28:21.530 --> 28:23.490]  Yeah, can you pay yourself? Is that okay?
[28:23.690 --> 28:25.530]  I feel like getting lunch for free every day.
[28:25.690 --> 28:28.510]  I'll get the beret if you get the 10k.
[28:29.950 --> 28:30.810]  Oh, what the hell?
[28:31.710 --> 28:32.130]  Uh-oh.
[28:32.690 --> 28:32.890]  Oh.
[28:33.350 --> 28:34.390]  Our paintress is pissed.
[28:34.950 --> 28:35.730]  Finish paintressing.
[28:36.070 --> 28:36.850]  Paintress is awake.
[28:38.270 --> 28:42.670]  This is one of those games where I'm going to redo this after we stop recording.
[28:43.510 --> 28:45.030]  And it'll be a completely different experience.
[28:45.470 --> 28:45.670]  Yes.
[28:46.410 --> 28:48.170]  Are you going to play this?
[28:48.910 --> 28:49.990]  I would give it a go.
[28:50.230 --> 28:51.030]  Hell yeah, dude.
[28:51.670 --> 28:54.670]  I think, like, depending on how this goes, I might play this.
[28:54.830 --> 28:56.230]  I like a...
[28:56.230 --> 28:57.670]  Some would say you're playing it right now.
[28:58.370 --> 29:01.590]  Okay. I like an action-oriented RPG where I can do something during the battles.
[29:02.650 --> 29:03.350]  And this is for you?
[29:06.630 --> 29:07.490]  All you do.
[29:12.670 --> 29:15.490]  Does it look pretty close to the Boston Celtics jersey numbers?
[29:17.050 --> 29:18.790]  Just seeing if it looks like a Mary Bird thing.
[29:19.550 --> 29:20.650]  Oh my God.
[29:20.750 --> 29:21.090]  Oh.
[29:21.470 --> 29:22.490]  Oh, that's what happens?
[29:22.790 --> 29:22.970]  Yep.
[29:23.110 --> 29:23.550]  Whoa.
[29:24.470 --> 29:24.850]  Damn.
[29:25.510 --> 29:26.330]  They just...
[29:26.330 --> 29:27.590]  All right, it's Infinity War all over again.
[29:27.590 --> 29:28.070]  Moused away for one second.
[29:28.170 --> 29:29.090]  Everybody turns into flowers?
[29:29.690 --> 29:30.050]  Yeah.
[29:31.150 --> 29:32.330]  Oh, that's why there's so many.
[29:32.390 --> 29:32.990]  Are you looking at Pat Benatar pictures again?
[29:33.050 --> 29:33.710]  I was.
[29:33.950 --> 29:34.730]  I was working on something.
[29:35.230 --> 29:35.790]  Oh, they don't want to see.
[29:35.790 --> 29:36.570]  So it's like...
[29:36.570 --> 29:37.510]  So they got Thanosed.
[29:38.410 --> 29:39.810]  Oh, that's what that's...
[29:39.810 --> 29:40.910]  This is cool now.
[29:41.010 --> 29:41.710]  I like this.
[29:41.810 --> 29:42.690]  This is interesting.
[29:44.130 --> 29:45.010]  Holy shit.
[29:45.010 --> 29:46.590]  This is really cool.
[29:46.870 --> 29:49.170]  I feel like her glasses also went...
[29:51.790 --> 29:52.190]  Yeah.
[29:53.550 --> 29:54.870]  They dropped it to 33.
[29:55.050 --> 29:56.550]  Everyone was surprised and disappeared.
[29:57.450 --> 29:57.870]  Everyone was surprised.
[29:57.870 --> 30:00.030]  I feel like all their clothes should still be there though.
[30:02.390 --> 30:03.550]  I would think so, but I guess not.
[30:03.550 --> 30:05.710]  I wonder if you were holding something really important.
[30:06.690 --> 30:06.870]  Yeah.
[30:06.970 --> 30:08.050]  Oh wait, how are these two still here?
[30:08.770 --> 30:09.570]  She's gonna go.
[30:09.730 --> 30:10.410]  Easy, you're younger.
[30:11.290 --> 30:11.430]  Yeah.
[30:11.430 --> 30:12.350]  But I thought he was 33.
[30:12.810 --> 30:13.730]  No, he's 32.
[30:13.870 --> 30:14.430]  She's 33.
[30:14.430 --> 30:14.710]  33.
[30:16.630 --> 30:18.130]  That's why she's wearing the flowers.
[30:18.810 --> 30:20.390]  So she thought she had a year after this.
[30:20.390 --> 30:22.510]  Flowers are the people who are gonna get snapped or whatever.
[30:25.970 --> 30:29.070]  It's like a really nice version of the composer from Halo 4.
[30:29.710 --> 30:29.970]  Yeah.
[30:33.470 --> 30:35.670]  I really like this.
[30:36.410 --> 30:37.050]  Holy shit.
[30:37.350 --> 30:38.850]  Like visually, this is very compelling.
[30:39.050 --> 30:39.650]  I like this a lot.
[30:41.410 --> 30:43.990]  Like it's easy for five guys to watch this and go,
[30:43.990 --> 30:45.150]  Ah, we're making fun of it.
[30:45.210 --> 30:46.810]  We're all in the bedroom making fun of the thing.
[30:46.930 --> 30:48.610]  But like, this is very well done.
[30:48.730 --> 30:53.650]  I like, this was way cooler than everyone has to like march off or something.
[30:53.770 --> 30:55.870]  Like having everyone disappear in that way is really interesting.
[30:58.290 --> 31:01.630]  What a horrifying, beautiful thing.
[31:01.930 --> 31:02.290]  I don't know.
[31:02.410 --> 31:02.990]  That's like...
[31:04.950 --> 31:05.970]  Doesn't seem painful.
[31:06.690 --> 31:06.950]  No.
[31:07.090 --> 31:07.990]  But here's the thing.
[31:08.070 --> 31:11.610]  When it gets dropped to 32 next year, which I assume that's what happens.
[31:11.730 --> 31:13.290]  Wouldn't this guy be older than that?
[31:13.290 --> 31:14.430]  So it wouldn't affect him?
[31:14.770 --> 31:16.090]  Oh, that's his loophole.
[31:16.350 --> 31:16.850]  Ah.
[31:17.830 --> 31:20.210]  He can argue it as he becomes flower petals.
[31:22.290 --> 31:24.050]  But that, like, am I wrong?
[31:24.110 --> 31:25.110]  Like, what am I missing?
[31:25.530 --> 31:28.270]  I guess it would be anyone over the number, I assume.
[31:29.310 --> 31:29.730]  Oh.
[31:30.470 --> 31:32.830]  Does it always drop or does she like jump it around?
[31:33.050 --> 31:34.630]  It drops by one every year.
[31:35.310 --> 31:35.870]  Fucking A.
[31:36.290 --> 31:37.310]  That's rough, dude.
[31:37.430 --> 31:40.330]  As everyone goes towards the number, the number goes down.
[31:40.810 --> 31:40.990]  Yep.
[31:41.970 --> 31:42.270]  Rough.
[31:43.390 --> 31:43.790]  Very.
[31:45.110 --> 31:46.110]  That's really bleak.
[31:46.450 --> 31:47.630]  It's so bleak.
[31:50.130 --> 31:51.450]  Classic Painteress stuff, dude.
[31:53.830 --> 31:56.430]  So we got a year to kill the Painteress so it doesn't happen to us.
[31:57.250 --> 31:57.990]  It would suck if you were...
[31:59.330 --> 32:02.730]  If you were just like founded in an orphanage and you didn't know your true age.
[32:03.910 --> 32:04.710]  Oh, man.
[32:04.890 --> 32:05.450]  Oh, wow.
[32:06.490 --> 32:06.910]  You're just...
[32:06.910 --> 32:09.030]  It's the year that I have to wear the flowers.
[32:09.130 --> 32:09.770]  Yeah, that would suck.
[32:09.770 --> 32:12.110]  And just sit around like shrugging like maybe this is it.
[32:16.560 --> 32:19.580]  You're like making plans for like a week from now and you go, ah, damn.
[32:19.840 --> 32:20.880]  And you just turn into flowers.
[32:22.100 --> 32:22.600]  All right.
[32:22.800 --> 32:23.500]  Good work, Geoff.
[32:23.640 --> 32:24.060]  Thanks, Geoff.
[32:24.260 --> 32:25.840]  I was busy making Andrew Benatar.
[32:25.980 --> 32:26.460]  What happened?
[32:26.520 --> 32:26.940]  She died?
[32:28.240 --> 32:28.660]  Yeah, man.
[32:28.740 --> 32:29.100]  She died.
[32:29.360 --> 32:29.740]  Yeah, hey.
[32:29.820 --> 32:31.400]  Did she turn into flowers?
[32:31.980 --> 32:32.280]  Yeah.
[32:32.420 --> 32:32.640]  She did.
[32:32.780 --> 32:33.360]  Because she was older?
[32:34.340 --> 32:34.660]  Yeah.
[32:35.060 --> 32:36.400]  I feel like you missed a nice support pop.
[32:36.580 --> 32:36.720]  Yeah.
[32:36.840 --> 32:37.160]  Yeah.
[32:37.160 --> 32:37.780]  Because she was older.
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.440]  I mean, that's what it was, right?
[32:41.120 --> 32:41.440]  Yeah.
[32:42.500 --> 32:42.840]  Hold on.
[32:42.860 --> 32:43.380]  I guess I didn't miss it.
[32:44.340 --> 32:44.780]  Yeah.
[32:45.220 --> 32:46.040]  Why are they celebrating?
[32:46.500 --> 32:49.120]  It was us watching that going, wow, this is actually really compelling.
[32:49.260 --> 32:49.860]  I like this a lot.
[32:50.000 --> 32:50.600]  This is pretty great.
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.820]  Well, I was celebrating because it's their last night.
[32:53.060 --> 32:54.300]  This is where they head out.
[32:54.900 --> 32:57.480]  Pat's going, check out Pat Benatar.
[32:57.940 --> 32:59.760]  I mixed it with Andrew's Mustang.
[33:00.180 --> 33:02.400]  They're making the same face in the fucking photo.
[33:02.480 --> 33:02.940]  They are.
[33:04.240 --> 33:06.280]  Like the exact same face.
[33:06.780 --> 33:07.940]  It looks really good.
[33:13.380 --> 33:17.040]  So he's celebrating because he didn't have to break up with her, which he was going to do anyway.
[33:17.460 --> 33:18.560]  But then she went ahead and died.
[33:18.820 --> 33:19.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:21.040 --> 33:21.780]  Yeah, you got it all.
[33:22.800 --> 33:24.220]  The ultimate ghosting.
[33:26.380 --> 33:28.100]  Where she becomes the ghost.
[33:31.180 --> 33:35.780]  That sounds... what you just described is a horror movie that will come out in like the next two years.
[33:35.920 --> 33:37.600]  And it will be called Ghosted.
[33:37.760 --> 33:37.960]  Yeah.
[33:40.760 --> 33:41.900]  You thought you could ghost me?
[33:43.120 --> 33:44.440]  You're haunted, bitch.
[33:49.120 --> 33:50.720]  Oh, I'm going to have to talk to people.
[33:51.380 --> 33:51.780]  If you want.
[33:52.040 --> 33:52.760]  You don't have to.
[33:53.020 --> 33:54.440]  Now you have to go kill the Patras.
[33:55.320 --> 33:55.900]  Yeah, I do.
[33:56.440 --> 33:58.760]  I got a festival token that I can get prizes.
[33:59.140 --> 34:03.680]  So you have a year to live, essentially, to kill the Patras or you're going to die.
[34:05.560 --> 34:06.000]  Exactly.
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.420]  It'd be cool if the game was like a real time timer.
[34:11.480 --> 34:13.840]  So you had an actual year from now to beat it.
[34:13.840 --> 34:14.540]  You have one year to beat it.
[34:15.480 --> 34:16.420]  There you go.
[34:16.600 --> 34:22.600]  Do you know how like when people will shred documents in a paper shredder and then lawyers will have to put them back together
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.100]  and it'll be like the scene in a movie when they're all around the conference room and they're like,
[34:26.180 --> 34:27.360]  well, nobody's going home this weekend.
[34:27.460 --> 34:30.660]  And they order pizza and then like five days later, they have it all taped together.
[34:31.060 --> 34:37.200]  Do you think you could tape people's flower petals back together in this game and get them back?
[34:37.580 --> 34:39.980]  Like, could you get your girlfriend back if you could find all of her flower petals?
[34:39.980 --> 34:41.760]  I assume they will rot though.
[34:42.260 --> 34:42.860]  If you're fast.
[34:43.460 --> 34:46.140]  Yeah, you just have to find flower petals in a beret.
[34:46.280 --> 34:49.160]  If you get a beret, then it's like that's like the Frosty the Snowman effect.
[34:49.360 --> 34:52.940]  But people like press flowers in books all the time.
[34:53.100 --> 34:55.200]  My wife has a bunch of old ass flowers like that.
[34:55.300 --> 34:57.000]  You could just press her into a big book.
[34:57.700 --> 34:58.240]  Oh, that's true.
[34:58.500 --> 34:58.880]  For later.
[34:58.900 --> 35:00.360]  Just laminate the shit out of her.
[35:00.660 --> 35:00.860]  Yeah.
[35:02.940 --> 35:05.140]  Sort of like the Lemire version of Ted Williams.
[35:06.100 --> 35:06.280]  Yeah.
[35:10.900 --> 35:15.560]  I'm gathering that past expeditions have definitely been successful.
[35:16.660 --> 35:17.100]  Yeah.
[35:18.880 --> 35:20.020]  Everyone nailed it.
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.160]  So, do you think and Andrew, you're pretty far into this game, right?
[35:27.020 --> 35:28.500]  And our girlfriend is definitely dead.
[35:28.560 --> 35:30.560]  Like she's flowers and the petals in the wind or whatever.
[35:31.340 --> 35:33.160]  Do you think we'll find love again?
[35:34.300 --> 35:35.680]  Yeah, I mean, here's my sister.
[35:35.840 --> 35:36.380]  So probably.
[35:36.700 --> 35:36.920]  Jesus.
[35:37.480 --> 35:37.620]  What?
[35:37.620 --> 35:38.100]  What?
[35:38.420 --> 35:39.540]  You guys like Star Wars?
[35:40.800 --> 35:41.420]  What's the problem?
[35:41.700 --> 35:42.000]  Jesus.
[35:42.040 --> 35:43.840]  So, does this affect the entire world?
[35:45.180 --> 35:45.780]  No, just France.
[35:46.660 --> 35:48.740]  It's like business as usual in the UK.
[35:49.300 --> 35:50.780]  Yeah, Italy's actually doing okay.
[35:51.360 --> 35:52.580]  France is devastated.
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.960]  This is actually the true reason for Brexit.
[35:55.540 --> 35:59.160]  They watch this on TV and they're like, fucking no, don't go there.
[35:59.320 --> 35:59.540]  Why?
[35:59.980 --> 36:01.940]  It's the reverse 28 days later.
[36:04.020 --> 36:05.380]  The UK is totally fine.
[36:05.380 --> 36:06.260]  See, she says known.
[36:06.460 --> 36:07.100]  This is French.
[36:07.380 --> 36:08.460]  Andrew, don't tell me it's not.
[36:09.020 --> 36:10.400]  Do you wish to have a rematch?
[36:10.760 --> 36:11.920]  Andrew, do I need to have a rematch with her?
[36:12.200 --> 36:13.040]  I don't think so.
[36:13.140 --> 36:13.420]  Maybe.
[36:13.780 --> 36:14.300]  Thank God.
[36:14.480 --> 36:14.940]  No, don't do it.
[36:15.280 --> 36:17.260]  But Andrew, I said no.
[36:17.460 --> 36:18.580]  Is there love in our future?
[36:20.020 --> 36:20.480]  There she is.
[36:22.320 --> 36:23.700]  Yeah, we're going to fall in love with her.
[36:23.860 --> 36:26.100]  The woman who was paid $30,000 to wear this hat.
[36:26.760 --> 36:28.620]  Who looks exactly like your girlfriend from behind.
[36:28.980 --> 36:32.380]  It's like when my wife Emily and I went up to...
[36:33.460 --> 36:33.960]  That's true.
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.260]  My wife Emily and I went up to Waco, to that...
[36:38.260 --> 36:41.700]  Whatever, the Chip and Joanna Gaines place in Magnolia.
[36:42.680 --> 36:44.740]  And I lost my wife in a crowd.
[36:44.920 --> 36:46.460]  And then I just sat down on a bench.
[36:46.620 --> 36:49.420]  And I just waited until the right blonde lady showed up.
[36:49.540 --> 36:53.680]  Because there were 700 of my wife around me.
[36:53.740 --> 36:55.280]  If she ever died, God forbid.
[36:55.500 --> 36:56.100]  I told her that day.
[36:56.100 --> 36:57.280]  I was like, God forbid you ever die.
[36:58.200 --> 37:01.540]  I'll be able to visit you every fucking Saturday at Magnolia.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.640]  Because it is unbelievable.
[37:03.640 --> 37:04.840]  She's so busy anyway.
[37:05.080 --> 37:05.680]  I barely...
[37:05.680 --> 37:07.340]  Just take care of Mayelle, okay?
[37:07.560 --> 37:08.500]  I'm going to take care of Mayelle.
[37:09.100 --> 37:11.400]  We're her guardians, not her jailers.
[37:11.500 --> 37:12.240]  I'm going to keep her in jail.
[37:13.820 --> 37:15.100]  The island of France?
[37:15.600 --> 37:16.620]  Don't you have a speech ticket?
[37:16.640 --> 37:18.680]  You mean the one you so kindly wrote for me?
[37:18.880 --> 37:19.660]  Just suggestions.
[37:20.300 --> 37:21.620]  I thought it might help you on...
[37:21.620 --> 37:23.060]  I hate exposition!
[37:23.800 --> 37:25.980]  Well, you keep inviting exposition.
[37:26.400 --> 37:27.360]  Yeah, you talk to her.
[37:27.440 --> 37:27.700]  Exposition takes, right?
[37:27.700 --> 37:29.660]  This is the thing so I can make it keep going.
[37:30.120 --> 37:31.580]  Okay, well then deal with exposition.
[37:32.220 --> 37:32.880]  Just a part, man.
[37:32.880 --> 37:33.040]  No!
[37:34.060 --> 37:34.980]  It's important.
[37:36.280 --> 37:37.020]  Would you eat that cake?
[37:37.480 --> 37:38.640]  Yeah, I'd eat that cake.
[37:39.340 --> 37:39.960]  That's funny.
[37:41.580 --> 37:42.900]  You get some of those candles.
[37:43.400 --> 37:45.200]  That cake was an eye fail, Tower.
[37:46.000 --> 37:46.460]  Nice!
[37:47.460 --> 37:47.680]  What?
[37:48.960 --> 37:49.540]  Hello, big man.
[37:53.100 --> 37:53.560]  Expeditioners.
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.440]  The Sword of Lumiere.
[37:58.400 --> 37:59.280]  We honor your sacrifice.
[38:00.420 --> 38:02.460]  We honor your dedication.
[38:02.840 --> 38:03.620]  It's pretty close.
[38:04.460 --> 38:05.400]  Well, I assume.
[38:05.720 --> 38:05.920]  But no one's coming back.
[38:05.920 --> 38:07.120]  We do not take for granted.
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.720]  You dedicate your final year of life to keeping hope alive for all of Lumiere.
[38:15.240 --> 38:18.060]  Some of you are leaving to change the world.
[38:19.260 --> 38:21.920]  Others, to discover the secrets of our universe.
[38:24.180 --> 38:26.260]  Some, to protect loved ones.
[38:28.700 --> 38:32.460]  Others, to find meaning in our all too short lives.
[38:34.920 --> 38:40.360]  As you sail into the unknown, know that Lumiere stands with you.
[38:42.280 --> 38:43.140]  Cool horn.
[38:43.540 --> 38:49.380]  So, this is one of those things where, like, previous expeditions never came back, right?
[38:49.860 --> 38:50.300]  That is correct.
[38:50.480 --> 38:50.940]  That's what it seems like.
[38:52.120 --> 38:53.640]  Actually, it's kind of cool.
[38:53.720 --> 38:56.720]  The collectibles in this game are the journals of other expeditions.
[38:57.560 --> 38:58.880]  That is really cool.
[39:01.160 --> 39:03.100]  I think it's free on Game Pass.
[39:03.800 --> 39:05.160]  You're going to have to download this game.
[39:05.400 --> 39:07.460]  Hopefully, Gavin already bought it on Steam.
[39:07.660 --> 39:08.200]  Yeah, Gavin.
[39:10.180 --> 39:12.100]  I think I'm going to oblivion it.
[39:13.380 --> 39:14.940]  And also, blueprints.
[39:16.640 --> 39:18.340]  Well, you're going to have to bring them all up.
[39:19.560 --> 39:21.280]  I feel kind of like he does.
[39:21.800 --> 39:23.260]  I'm downloading this game right now.
[39:23.360 --> 39:23.760]  Hold on a second.
[39:24.400 --> 39:25.040]  I'm fucking hooked.
[39:25.200 --> 39:27.980]  I'm going to quit playing Oblivion from this stupid French RPG.
[39:28.980 --> 39:29.860]  It's really good.
[39:29.980 --> 39:31.800]  Which one leaps Game Pass first?
[39:33.040 --> 39:34.560]  Yeah, I'm done with JRPGs.
[39:34.640 --> 39:35.920]  I'm moving on to FRPGs.
[39:38.460 --> 39:39.520]  I'm going to do the whole alphabet.
[39:39.780 --> 39:40.580]  It's a small genre.
[39:41.160 --> 39:41.320]  Yeah.
[39:41.600 --> 39:42.480]  That's a cool boat.
[39:43.120 --> 39:44.420]  I bet it flies at some point.
[39:45.020 --> 39:45.780]  Yeah, probably.
[39:47.480 --> 39:50.180]  Do you think Cid is in this game from Final Fantasy?
[39:50.380 --> 39:51.640]  It's like a nod to something.
[39:51.860 --> 39:53.340]  I thought you were going to say from Toy Story.
[39:53.880 --> 39:55.540]  Yeah, do you think Cid from Toy Story is in this game?
[39:55.680 --> 39:57.840]  Do you think we'll win the Blitzball Championship?
[39:58.500 --> 39:59.300]  Oh, shit.
[39:59.860 --> 40:02.500]  Do you think the paintress is just Cid?
[40:03.120 --> 40:04.080]  Oh, wow.
[40:04.760 --> 40:06.380]  It's your dad, but it's not your dad.
[40:06.500 --> 40:07.140]  Oh, shit.
[40:08.380 --> 40:09.800]  I could change the difficulty at any time.
[40:10.540 --> 40:11.740]  I'm going to bleep Chocobos.
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.540]  I have spent all my time at the Golden Nugget.
[40:18.680 --> 40:19.860]  Something like that.
[40:19.920 --> 40:20.540]  Why not?
[40:20.780 --> 40:21.800]  Golden Nugget.
[40:22.060 --> 40:22.940]  I like the Golden Nugget.
[40:23.440 --> 40:24.240]  Golden Circle.
[40:25.020 --> 40:25.740]  Oh, man.
[40:25.880 --> 40:26.880]  Isn't that the strip club in GTA?
[40:28.560 --> 40:29.580]  That's where I spend all my time.
[40:29.760 --> 40:31.360]  Stepping on all the perfectly good charcoal.
[40:33.160 --> 40:34.120]  Got to the continent.
[40:34.900 --> 40:36.560]  Well, we know what happened to the previous boats.
[40:37.460 --> 40:37.700]  Yep.
[40:39.780 --> 40:40.820]  Well, no one came back for them.
[40:40.820 --> 40:41.780]  Where else are they going to go?
[40:46.400 --> 40:47.860]  Always leave if you hear that sound.
[40:48.100 --> 40:48.400]  Yeah.
[40:49.760 --> 40:50.800]  Oh, what the hell is that?
[40:51.100 --> 40:52.220]  A businessman?
[40:52.700 --> 40:53.860]  Oh, my God. It's an old guy.
[40:54.600 --> 40:55.460]  How did he live?
[40:59.060 --> 41:00.680]  Eric, you better get to the bottom of this.
[41:01.240 --> 41:02.380]  I don't care who's at the top.
[41:05.580 --> 41:07.040]  What's his secret? He's not French.
[41:08.060 --> 41:08.180]  Yeah.
[41:09.600 --> 41:11.540]  Oh, what's happening here?
[41:12.080 --> 41:12.820]  He's American.
[41:12.820 --> 41:13.960]  French Canadian.
[41:14.440 --> 41:15.660]  That's my French.
[41:15.740 --> 41:16.980]  Oh, that's good.
[41:19.100 --> 41:21.200]  So, like, these people, none of these people like him.
[41:23.800 --> 41:27.380]  He wants to join up with them, but all these people are going, fuck you.
[41:27.920 --> 41:29.580]  We've never seen gray hair before.
[41:30.780 --> 41:33.300]  Rejected by 100 expedition teams.
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.660]  Kind of looks like Pierce Brosnan.
[41:37.160 --> 41:37.520]  A little.
[41:39.380 --> 41:42.800]  Maybe we should go ahead and cast this now in case it gets like the Until Dawn treatment.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.560]  Get old.
[41:49.230 --> 41:51.870]  So, he has both eyes, just a big scar. Oh, it's crazy.
[41:52.010 --> 41:52.710]  He does look like Pierce Brosnan.
[41:54.770 --> 41:55.170]  What?
[41:56.330 --> 41:56.730]  Oh.
[41:57.570 --> 41:58.490]  The last one.
[42:02.310 --> 42:03.110]  Oh, shit.
[42:03.970 --> 42:05.290]  Don't ask this guy questions.
[42:08.490 --> 42:10.250]  That was awesome.
[42:10.650 --> 42:11.550]  His whole head went.
[42:13.410 --> 42:15.050]  Oh, saving Private Ryan shit.
[42:17.290 --> 42:17.730]  Wow, dude.
[42:18.350 --> 42:19.630]  It's really going wrong.
[42:21.170 --> 42:23.050]  Dude, we just got here.
[42:24.950 --> 42:27.250]  You see why this game was free? It's already over.
[42:27.810 --> 42:30.070]  Dear diary, night one was shit.
[42:31.150 --> 42:34.290]  Turns out 33 was how many seconds we survived.
[42:35.290 --> 42:35.450]  It was.
[42:41.090 --> 42:42.810]  This is the beginning of the suicide squad.
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.280]  See, they're speaking French.
[42:50.580 --> 42:55.460]  Did discover the secrets of the universe and protect your family or whatever she said in the speech.
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.480]  What the...
[42:59.740 --> 43:01.880]  Lost? A lot of bad sense.
[43:01.880 --> 43:02.860]  It's a smoke monster?
[43:03.220 --> 43:05.180]  It's a light monster. Oh, no, it's a smoke monster.
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.380]  It's Mr. Echo.
[43:06.880 --> 43:07.920]  Echo's pissed.
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.160]  Boon is back and he's furious.
[43:15.680 --> 43:18.360]  This expedition was a bad idea.
[43:21.960 --> 43:23.820]  Is it the thing from the sculpture?
[43:24.880 --> 43:25.080]  No.
[43:25.920 --> 43:26.620]  Oh, no.
[43:27.720 --> 43:29.180]  That looks awesome.
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.660]  That's a cool looking monster.
[43:31.820 --> 43:34.580]  It's like the bad guy in Super Smash Bros.
[43:34.580 --> 43:37.200]  Yeah, the bad guy.
[43:37.640 --> 43:38.540]  The hand.
[43:39.980 --> 43:40.640]  Master Hand.
[43:41.500 --> 43:42.220]  Yo, what's up dog?
[43:42.980 --> 43:43.620]  Hey, hello.
[43:47.220 --> 43:48.720]  Do something with your sword.
[43:49.500 --> 43:50.660]  Do something with your robot hand.
[43:50.920 --> 43:52.280]  They called me Handjob.
[43:55.680 --> 43:56.440]  Oh, shit.
[43:57.060 --> 43:58.760]  Stand there and get fucking casted.
[43:58.860 --> 43:59.480]  You did very little about that.
[44:01.580 --> 44:05.480]  They're not even done waving goodbye back on the other coast.
[44:06.940 --> 44:08.280]  Everybody's already dead.
[44:08.680 --> 44:11.020]  Cut to the other side of, I hope they do well.
[44:11.440 --> 44:16.500]  There's like a guy sweeping up confetti with a broom going like, Godspeed you youngins.
[44:17.140 --> 44:20.900]  Those three kids are going, I think this is going to be the year when they solve it.
[44:21.000 --> 44:22.360]  I think this is great.
[44:26.920 --> 44:28.300]  Strong fabric graphics.
[44:33.390 --> 44:34.390]  Metal too.
[44:37.230 --> 44:38.190]  Something stinks.
[44:39.210 --> 44:39.490]  Inky.
[44:40.950 --> 44:41.510]  Inky.
[44:41.890 --> 44:45.070]  So the hands didn't kill me, just sort of knocked me around.
[44:45.490 --> 44:46.390]  Made it.
[44:47.210 --> 44:49.270]  It looks like his hand is made out of his boat.
[44:50.110 --> 44:50.490]  Yeah, kinda.
[44:51.570 --> 44:52.210]  Boat hand.
[44:54.890 --> 44:55.850]  He's like Spoonman.
[45:00.970 --> 45:02.090]  Boat hand!
[45:05.610 --> 45:06.010]  Uh...
[45:07.630 --> 45:09.630]  So what was the first number written in the sky?
[45:10.470 --> 45:10.710]  One.
[45:10.810 --> 45:11.370]  It's a great question.
[45:12.090 --> 45:13.110]  No, it wouldn't be one.
[45:14.230 --> 45:14.890]  Maybe it was 100.
[45:16.890 --> 45:19.130]  Two guys disappeared and they went, where'd they go?
[45:19.430 --> 45:21.690]  Andrew, did you find out what the first number was?
[45:21.910 --> 45:23.570]  I think it's implied that it was 100.
[45:24.170 --> 45:24.430]  Okay.
[45:25.490 --> 45:26.930]  Man, they pissed away a lot of time.
[45:27.210 --> 45:30.570]  I wonder how many years that number went down before they realized somebody was going to die.
[45:30.830 --> 45:33.390]  There was nobody over 86 in their community.
[45:34.110 --> 45:35.890]  987, they're like, what's going to happen next year?
[45:36.710 --> 45:37.670]  And then they're like...
[45:37.670 --> 45:40.470]  The first 20 expositions must have been pretty ropey with all those old people.
[45:41.070 --> 45:43.150]  And it was just like, so did he just die because he's old?
[45:43.190 --> 45:44.710]  Or did he die because of the number thing?
[45:47.530 --> 45:47.910]  Like...
[45:48.490 --> 45:50.570]  Guys, you do not want to turn 101.
[45:50.950 --> 45:52.230]  You fucking melt.
[45:57.090 --> 45:59.250]  They don't even turn into a bunch of roses.
[45:59.510 --> 46:01.570]  It's just like two flower petals that float away.
[46:02.810 --> 46:04.690]  That'd really help with the old man smell, though.
[46:05.130 --> 46:06.510]  Much prettier the next day.
[46:07.110 --> 46:07.870]  Yeah, no kidding.
[46:08.710 --> 46:10.010]  So it's like Minecraft.
[46:10.750 --> 46:11.830]  Zombies come out at night.
[46:12.590 --> 46:13.690]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just like Minecraft.
[46:14.130 --> 46:15.590]  Alright, this is it. This is the game.
[46:16.270 --> 46:16.970]  Welcome to it.
[46:18.010 --> 46:19.370]  Are we dead the whole time?
[46:19.870 --> 46:20.250]  Yeah.
[46:20.770 --> 46:23.130]  It's like a Jacob's Ladder scenario.
[46:23.290 --> 46:24.490]  It's a Jacob's Ladder scenario.
[46:26.010 --> 46:28.990]  We're on an operating table somewhere in the Vietnam War right now.
[46:29.230 --> 46:29.630]  Damn.
[46:30.130 --> 46:31.550]  What am I going to freak out on a dance floor?
[46:31.550 --> 46:33.450]  Huge spoiler for that film, if you haven't seen it.
[46:33.490 --> 46:33.690]  Sorry.
[46:35.010 --> 46:35.630]  I think.
[46:37.450 --> 46:40.670]  No, it came out in like 1988.
[46:40.990 --> 46:41.950]  You had time to watch it.
[46:43.830 --> 46:45.470]  You'd be dead if you were in this game.
[46:46.430 --> 46:46.790]  Yeah.
[47:05.070 --> 47:05.990]  I'm locked in.
[47:07.610 --> 47:08.070]  What is that?
[47:08.110 --> 47:08.650]  I think we all are.
[47:10.690 --> 47:11.190]  Oh shit.
[47:11.850 --> 47:12.170]  Uh oh.
[47:13.410 --> 47:14.450]  Oh no, a guard.
[47:14.690 --> 47:15.990]  It's a tree bot.
[47:17.150 --> 47:18.490]  Oh no, it's tree bot.
[47:18.810 --> 47:19.370]  Tree bot?
[47:24.490 --> 47:24.930]  Oh.
[47:25.690 --> 47:26.330]  Hell yeah.
[47:27.910 --> 47:29.110]  Didn't think to do this on the beach,
[47:29.150 --> 47:29.770]  but here we go.
[47:32.450 --> 47:33.830]  I can take your tree bot.
[47:34.890 --> 47:36.090]  Try to talk to him first.
[47:36.330 --> 47:37.470]  Maybe you don't need to fight.
[47:38.090 --> 47:38.590]  No dice.
[47:40.170 --> 47:43.330]  Free aim shots are a good way to hit flying enemies.
[47:43.330 --> 47:44.510]  He's not flying.
[47:45.530 --> 47:46.650]  He's just standing.
[47:48.210 --> 47:49.770]  Shooting costs 1 AP.
[47:50.250 --> 47:51.130]  What's his weak point?
[47:51.190 --> 47:51.710]  His face?
[47:52.170 --> 47:53.810]  Looks like it.
[47:55.100 --> 47:56.310]  Dude, he's blind now.
[47:56.690 --> 47:57.210]  Face off?
[48:05.430 --> 48:07.970]  It's kind of like you dodged into it.
[48:08.650 --> 48:10.090]  You returned to it.
[48:13.110 --> 48:14.430]  He attacks slowly.
[48:15.130 --> 48:15.470]  Uh oh.
[48:15.470 --> 48:16.370]  Uh oh.
[48:18.610 --> 48:20.250]  He baited me big time.
[48:20.390 --> 48:20.970]  That was nasty.
[48:21.930 --> 48:22.730]  Jacked you right off.
[48:23.470 --> 48:24.730]  Just like the hands on the beach.
[48:25.330 --> 48:26.550]  Fuck you, tree bot.
[48:26.750 --> 48:27.910]  Successful dodges won.
[48:28.310 --> 48:30.110]  Guys, I'm going to press A for we continue.
[48:31.010 --> 48:31.690]  Yeah, battle loot.
[48:33.610 --> 48:35.650]  And this time it's from somebody else's pocket.
[48:36.610 --> 48:37.230]  Tree bot.
[48:40.890 --> 48:41.630]  Oh nice.
[48:41.970 --> 48:42.530]  I loved her.
[48:56.770 --> 48:57.970]  Take the lance.
[48:58.070 --> 48:59.050]  Alright, moving on.
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.180]  And back in.
[49:06.020 --> 49:06.620]  Do I check?
[49:07.800 --> 49:09.180]  Can I have this?
[49:09.540 --> 49:09.740]  No.
[49:11.540 --> 49:13.240]  Did that shrub just grow?
[49:14.940 --> 49:15.200]  Where?
[49:16.340 --> 49:17.660]  Maybe it was there the whole time.
[49:19.500 --> 49:23.120]  I mean, if it's alive, it probably did grow a little bit during that time.
[49:23.120 --> 49:23.620]  Oh, dude.
[49:23.860 --> 49:23.980]  No, it didn't.
[49:23.980 --> 49:26.140]  Okay, so this is cool, but imagine if it was a drone.
[49:26.620 --> 49:26.680]  Yeah!
[49:27.460 --> 49:28.560]  That'd be so much cooler.
[49:29.100 --> 49:30.900]  It could follow you around this dark...
[49:30.900 --> 49:31.800]  Oh, what's up there?
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.120]  This looks like the art in my uncle's house.
[49:37.580 --> 49:39.040]  It definitely looks like uncle art.
[49:39.240 --> 49:40.740]  Does your uncle collect chroma?
[49:41.700 --> 49:42.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[49:43.220 --> 49:44.440]  Big chroma fiend, dude.
[49:44.840 --> 49:45.540]  Uncle art.
[49:48.160 --> 49:48.840]  I'm right.
[49:50.500 --> 49:51.200]  Nothing back here.
[49:51.200 --> 49:52.040]  This looks awesome.
[49:52.380 --> 49:54.340]  I really like all this.
[49:54.760 --> 49:56.620]  It's been a long time since I've seen...
[49:57.480 --> 49:59.320]  It's been a long time since I've seen an RPG
[49:59.320 --> 50:01.200]  that is...
[50:01.780 --> 50:02.840]  I like turn-based
[50:02.840 --> 50:04.380]  and interesting to look at like this.
[50:04.500 --> 50:06.820]  Is that in your top three skyboxes of 2025?
[50:08.060 --> 50:08.440]  Ooh!
[50:09.480 --> 50:10.320]  I do love a good skybox.
[50:10.320 --> 50:13.020]  If this was Achievement Hunter, that'd have to be a four-minute video now
[50:13.020 --> 50:15.140]  where we have to actually find
[50:15.140 --> 50:16.360]  all the best skyboxes.
[50:16.600 --> 50:17.200]  Oh, God.
[50:18.560 --> 50:19.320]  Let's do it.
[50:20.700 --> 50:22.460]  I think I might actually play this.
[50:22.540 --> 50:24.040]  This looks visually very cool.
[50:25.720 --> 50:26.860]  Okay, not what I mean.
[50:27.160 --> 50:27.680]  Shut up.
[50:29.600 --> 50:30.680]  Not what I mean.
[50:30.880 --> 50:31.320]  Got him.
[50:32.960 --> 50:33.840]  Got him pretty hard.
[50:35.080 --> 50:36.800]  Oh, wow. I don't even actually have to climb.
[50:36.920 --> 50:38.420]  I can just go to something. Oh, my God.
[50:39.420 --> 50:40.440]  I just got into oblivion.
[50:40.740 --> 50:41.820]  Oh, it is. It's just bodies.
[50:42.660 --> 50:43.020]  What?
[50:43.400 --> 50:43.760]  What?
[50:47.200 --> 50:48.580]  I didn't know I could do this.
[50:48.840 --> 50:50.700]  I just found out. I just held this button.
[50:52.360 --> 50:52.680]  Behold!
[50:53.760 --> 50:54.480]  Yeah, hell yeah, baby.
[50:55.260 --> 50:57.120]  Do you think this is an expedition that made it further
[50:57.120 --> 50:58.920]  than you guys did, which was four feet?
[50:59.340 --> 51:00.500]  I was going to say this about...
[51:00.500 --> 51:01.900]  This is 44, I can tell.
[51:02.580 --> 51:03.980]  They may have come in the daytime.
[51:04.880 --> 51:05.120]  Oh.
[51:06.560 --> 51:08.260]  They did pretty well until they...
[51:08.260 --> 51:08.560]  Oh, okay.
[51:15.960 --> 51:17.320]  Don't forget the collectibles.
[51:18.240 --> 51:19.040]  What collectibles?
[51:19.340 --> 51:20.820]  Oh, God, you sent him back.
[51:21.680 --> 51:23.460]  There's hidden collectibles? Oh, boy.
[51:24.480 --> 51:25.580]  Now you're playing like me.
[51:26.160 --> 51:27.720]  Now you're playing like me in Last of Us.
[51:27.740 --> 51:29.760]  Andrew said that they were collectibles
[51:29.760 --> 51:32.040]  in the form of notes from previous dead people.
[51:32.300 --> 51:32.740]  I just saw like...
[51:32.740 --> 51:35.040]  I'm trying to move it along because it's in a video,
[51:35.160 --> 51:37.720]  but I will play this
[51:37.720 --> 51:40.220]  and go through every fucking inch of this stupid game.
[51:40.400 --> 51:41.460]  Well, luckily for you,
[51:41.480 --> 51:43.960]  you're moving into a red room, which is usually a good sign.
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.820]  Oh, it's a milf nest.
[51:46.600 --> 51:47.280]  Oh, shit.
[51:47.940 --> 51:49.660]  Uh-oh, don't overwhelm me.
[51:50.860 --> 51:52.040]  Hey, that reminds me.
[51:52.160 --> 51:54.280]  It's about time to pick up The Last of Us Part 2 again.
[51:54.680 --> 51:55.720]  You're crazy.
[51:56.420 --> 51:57.680]  What? Why? Oh, these are all 33?
[51:57.820 --> 51:58.720]  How come they look like that?
[51:59.320 --> 52:00.300]  They look like stone.
[52:00.720 --> 52:02.540]  They got sucked to stone.
[52:03.760 --> 52:05.880]  Oh, I think probably finding the armbands
[52:05.880 --> 52:08.140]  of people is going to be crazy as you keep going.
[52:09.260 --> 52:10.000]  Oh, yeah.
[52:10.180 --> 52:12.160]  Oh, wow. What the fuck?
[52:14.260 --> 52:15.360]  Fate worse than death.
[52:16.460 --> 52:17.800]  This looks crazy.
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.460]  The milfs did this?
[52:20.720 --> 52:22.080]  Can you climb the milfs, do you think?
[52:22.900 --> 52:23.980]  Dude, they're going to be,
[52:24.100 --> 52:26.020]  like, there have to be so few milfs
[52:26.020 --> 52:26.880]  in this game.
[52:27.280 --> 52:29.560]  Just by age, you know what I mean?
[52:30.140 --> 52:31.200]  Her eyes are open?
[52:31.820 --> 52:32.940]  Oh, my God.
[52:32.960 --> 52:35.880]  She's alive. She looks fresh.
[52:37.020 --> 52:38.020]  She's not blinking, Eric.
[52:38.080 --> 52:38.720]  I think she's dead.
[52:39.060 --> 52:39.660]  No, she's alive.
[52:39.660 --> 52:40.060]  Okay.
[52:42.600 --> 52:44.020]  Is he going to blow his own head off?
[52:44.140 --> 52:45.740]  Oh, this is just like the beginning
[52:45.740 --> 52:46.760]  of Equalizer 3.
[52:46.860 --> 52:47.460]  Oh, my God.
[52:52.960 --> 52:53.860]  But you made it
[52:53.860 --> 52:54.600]  this far, dude.
[52:55.740 --> 52:57.460]  I mean, if he's got magical powers,
[52:57.500 --> 52:59.000]  why doesn't he just melt his own brain?
[53:00.580 --> 53:01.400]  He's about to.
[53:03.100 --> 53:03.900]  He forgot
[53:03.900 --> 53:04.840]  to manifest a bullet.
[53:05.180 --> 53:05.580]  Yeah.
[53:08.400 --> 53:09.380]  Hey, Nick.
[53:09.380 --> 53:11.220]  Hey, it's her.
[53:11.340 --> 53:12.400]  It's not that different girl.
[53:13.060 --> 53:14.500]  Hey, listen.
[53:15.140 --> 53:16.700]  Nick knows his milfs.
[53:17.040 --> 53:18.220]  Jesus Christ.
[53:19.520 --> 53:21.100]  I'm glad there's a couple bits
[53:21.100 --> 53:22.340]  that have continued on.
[53:25.560 --> 53:26.840]  Next, she has a nickname.
[53:27.160 --> 53:27.660]  Milf Noah.
[53:28.480 --> 53:29.480]  That's awesome.
[53:32.840 --> 53:33.960]  Schwarza Milfer.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.320]  Do you think Xbox Live
[53:37.320 --> 53:38.200]  would let me pick that?
[53:40.020 --> 53:41.040]  Milf Noah is a good one.
[53:41.100 --> 53:43.300]  Milf Noah feels like someone I'd play Marvel Rivals with.
[53:43.420 --> 53:44.340]  It's like an MVP thing.
[53:44.920 --> 53:46.600]  MVP with Punisher. Milf Noah.
[53:47.640 --> 53:48.900]  And you do what with the milfs?
[53:49.140 --> 53:51.060]  I just kind of identify them.
[53:51.960 --> 53:52.620]  Categorize them.
[53:53.080 --> 53:53.640]  I know them.
[53:55.700 --> 53:56.900]  Need a milf? Come to me.
[53:59.320 --> 54:00.480]  Give me a name. Any name.
[54:02.820 --> 54:03.940]  I'll tell you if they're a milfer.
[54:07.320 --> 54:08.140]  David Brent's band.
[54:11.120 --> 54:12.540]  Fork on conclusion.
[54:16.360 --> 54:18.240]  Uh oh.
[54:19.240 --> 54:20.900]  Someone's playing the biggest drum.
[54:23.140 --> 54:24.120]  It's the Uber milf.
[54:24.600 --> 54:26.720]  Did somebody say milf?
[54:32.900 --> 54:34.760]  The dumbest life.
[54:37.380 --> 54:37.860]  Putin.
[54:38.820 --> 54:41.280]  It would be crazy to be old and just look back
[54:41.280 --> 54:43.000]  and think that was one of the dumber lives.
[54:46.080 --> 54:49.600]  Alright, time to free aim
[54:49.600 --> 54:50.300]  this bitch.
[54:51.640 --> 54:52.840]  You can shoot it at the shield.
[54:55.860 --> 54:57.120]  Head center, bitch.
[54:57.340 --> 54:57.820]  Geez.
[54:59.380 --> 54:59.840]  Should I?
[55:00.640 --> 55:02.060]  Oh no, it didn't like it.
[55:02.760 --> 55:03.440]  Try the penis.
[55:04.440 --> 55:05.620]  Yeah, take it out.
[55:05.900 --> 55:07.860]  Take it out and it's milf penis.
[55:09.680 --> 55:11.660]  Okay, she can do stains.
[55:12.000 --> 55:12.900]  She'll stain it.
[55:13.120 --> 55:14.320]  There are five stains.
[55:14.760 --> 55:16.600]  She's going to stain this thing everywhere.
[55:16.820 --> 55:19.200]  I just had a worm called milf stain.
[55:19.880 --> 55:20.880]  That's crazy.
[55:23.680 --> 55:25.380]  Ice lance and immolation.
[55:25.580 --> 55:27.260]  Ice lance is an ice skill
[55:27.260 --> 55:28.540]  that generates ice stain.
[55:29.100 --> 55:31.320]  Ice lance generates ice stain.
[55:31.820 --> 55:34.260]  Geoff, ice lance generates ice stain.
[55:34.540 --> 55:35.880]  I mean, you're in a red room
[55:35.880 --> 55:37.300]  so I'd go with opposites, right?
[55:37.780 --> 55:37.800]  Oh!
[55:40.380 --> 55:41.200]  That's pretty cool.
[55:42.660 --> 55:43.380]  That was awesome.
[55:43.700 --> 55:44.540]  Slows the debuff.
[55:46.060 --> 55:47.440]  You broke her tennis shoes.
[55:48.200 --> 55:49.520]  What's your go-to stain remover?
[55:50.800 --> 55:51.560]  Oh, we have to parry?
[55:52.720 --> 55:53.100]  There we go.
[55:54.020 --> 55:54.460]  Whoa!
[55:55.400 --> 55:56.160]  That was sick.
[55:56.260 --> 55:57.460]  I like to shout it out.
[55:57.460 --> 55:58.860]  Oh yeah?
[55:59.180 --> 55:59.520]  Yeah.
[56:00.500 --> 56:05.100]  Okay, Loon now has...
[56:05.100 --> 56:06.120]  Gavin, pay attention.
[56:06.420 --> 56:09.300]  Loon now has one ice stain and one light stain.
[56:09.660 --> 56:11.840]  Immolation will consume Loon's ice stain
[56:11.840 --> 56:13.260]  to deal increased damage.
[56:13.700 --> 56:15.580]  Light stains will be consumed
[56:15.580 --> 56:17.560]  if no corresponding elemental stains
[56:17.560 --> 56:18.660]  are available, idiot.
[56:19.260 --> 56:21.380]  So light stain is like a wild card stain?
[56:21.860 --> 56:22.900]  Seems like it.
[56:22.900 --> 56:28.360]  Critical stain!
[56:28.780 --> 56:30.280]  So you use up ice to use fire?
[56:30.940 --> 56:32.180]  Yeah. Burn. Now he's burned.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.440]  Oh, I think you might have done it.
[56:34.760 --> 56:35.400]  That's right.
[56:35.760 --> 56:36.060]  Victory!
[56:37.680 --> 56:38.420]  We did it.
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.300]  So how crazy do these fights get, Andrew?
[56:44.360 --> 56:45.000]  Is it like...
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.060]  I have a feeling this is going to get nuts.
[56:52.600 --> 56:53.000]  This...
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.360]  This seems like it's going to be a thing
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.920]  where you have to be so on your fucking toes
[56:57.920 --> 56:59.700]  and play like pitch perfect near the end.
[56:59.900 --> 57:00.960]  What the fuck is he...
[57:00.960 --> 57:01.980]  What is this he's got?
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  So they talked about him having
[57:04.760 --> 57:07.360]  some kind of like...
[57:07.980 --> 57:09.740]  thing that he made?
[57:09.880 --> 57:11.000]  Like earlier, I think?
[57:11.100 --> 57:12.700]  A chromatic something? I don't know.
[57:13.000 --> 57:13.700]  Oh, the abberator.
[57:13.900 --> 57:15.180]  Yeah, the abberation.
[57:16.060 --> 57:25.060]  Fuck, I want to play this.
[57:25.380 --> 57:26.960]  Do you think her last name is Atik?
[57:27.620 --> 57:28.920]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[57:28.940 --> 57:30.200]  Dude, I got new pictos.
[57:30.580 --> 57:32.980]  So, who's the lady?
[57:33.840 --> 57:34.920]  She's part of Expedition 33.
[57:36.000 --> 57:36.940]  Yeah, what are you talking about, dude?
[57:37.480 --> 57:39.400]  She's one of the Expedition...
[57:39.400 --> 57:40.400]  Yeah, she survived.
[57:40.640 --> 57:41.660]  Oh, Nick, Nick, Nick.
[57:41.900 --> 57:44.700]  Nick, check it out.
[57:44.860 --> 57:45.540]  All the bodies?
[57:45.980 --> 57:50.160]  Oh, she's barefoot.
[57:50.320 --> 57:51.020]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:51.020 --> 57:52.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:52.380 --> 57:52.900]  Good, good.
[57:54.860 --> 57:56.540]  She's got bare feet, great.
[57:56.700 --> 57:57.300]  That's fantastic.
[57:58.340 --> 58:00.060]  She can float?
[58:00.520 --> 58:01.100]  That's a good bit.
[58:01.440 --> 58:02.240]  There you go.
[58:02.820 --> 58:05.960]  She can float so you can just check them out.
[58:07.460 --> 58:08.480]  I've probably put
[58:08.480 --> 58:10.940]  27 hours into this game and never noticed.
[58:12.500 --> 58:13.200]  That's the difference
[58:13.200 --> 58:13.820]  between you and Nick.
[58:14.540 --> 58:16.240]  Well, here's the thing. Eric pointed it out.
[58:16.480 --> 58:17.560]  Well, yes, Eric.
[58:17.560 --> 58:19.160]  Dude, for you.
[58:19.540 --> 58:21.400]  I pointed out for you a guy
[58:21.400 --> 58:23.300]  that I co-owned two businesses with, man.
[58:23.500 --> 58:25.340]  You don't think I would've noticed it if I was into it?
[58:25.560 --> 58:27.360]  You were pretending not to, but it's fine.
[58:27.540 --> 58:29.760]  I feel like nobody knows you better than Eric.
[58:32.680 --> 58:33.700]  Who am I?
[58:36.500 --> 58:37.300]  That's crazy.
[58:42.760 --> 58:43.920]  Andrew, should we keep going
[58:43.920 --> 58:45.500]  or should we wrap this thing up?
[58:45.500 --> 58:46.340]  Is there a place to stop?
[58:46.740 --> 58:47.720]  I thought so, too.
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.320]  I'm learning a lot.
[58:51.520 --> 58:52.840]  I'm definitely going to play this game.
[58:54.060 --> 58:55.320]  I have this power.
[58:56.020 --> 58:57.320]  Get away from me.
[58:58.020 --> 58:58.720]  We're the MILFs.
[58:59.060 --> 59:00.100]  Tell me where the MILFs are.
[59:01.940 --> 59:02.740]  Thanks for watching.
[59:03.660 --> 59:05.160]  I don't know that we'll do a part two of this
[59:05.160 --> 59:06.580]  because I'm just probably going to play it, but
[59:07.560 --> 59:09.580]  let us know if we should do more videos in this style
[59:09.580 --> 59:11.020]  where we just check something out for a while.
[59:11.640 --> 59:13.660]  Or if you want us to do a part two in this.
[59:15.740 --> 59:16.180]  No.
[59:17.100 --> 59:18.540]  You can check out the Patreon.
[59:19.140 --> 59:20.880]  You can check out, what else?
[59:22.260 --> 59:23.700]  We have Fuck Face Off
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.020]  on Patreon.
[59:25.800 --> 59:27.220]  And we have
[59:27.220 --> 59:29.960]  a lot going on. A lot of fun surprises.
[59:30.320 --> 59:31.540]  A lot of exciting things
[59:31.540 --> 59:33.640]  happening in the world of regulation.
[59:33.920 --> 59:35.120]  And you can check them out on the podcast.
[59:35.620 --> 59:37.840]  So, until then, we'll see you next time.
[59:38.380 --> 59:40.320]  Love you. Part two coming soon.
[59:40.560 --> 59:41.200]  Bye-bye.
[59:41.540 --> 59:42.080]  Check it out, Nick.
[59:42.460 --> 59:43.000]  Nick, look.
[59:43.200 --> 59:44.440]  Eric, why do you love feet so much?
[59:45.640 --> 59:47.100]  He's trying. He's trying.
[59:47.300 --> 59:48.140]  I'm not trying anything.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.500]  Yeah, here we go.
[59:52.120 --> 59:53.940]  Eric, I heard the last site you went to was Milf Hunter.
[59:54.720 --> 59:55.040]  Yeah.
[59:56.380 --> 59:57.560]  That's fine. I'll take that one.
[59:57.680 --> 59:58.640]  I got no problem with that.
[59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.380]  I don't know why you're trying to battle the milf allegations. That's fine.
