[00:00.000 --> 00:02.380]  What's up, piss rats in the chat?
[00:03.140 --> 00:03.940]  Hello there.
[00:04.300 --> 00:05.680]  Is this the final Last of Us stream?
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.260]  It is. Yes.
[00:08.720 --> 00:10.340]  How far into the game are we?
[00:11.640 --> 00:13.480]  We're not going to get close.
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.440]  But we'll continue at some point, right?
[00:17.580 --> 00:20.920]  Because we started before Halloween month.
[00:21.780 --> 00:22.720]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[00:24.740 --> 00:25.960]  We'll see how these do.
[00:26.100 --> 00:26.900]  Oh, maybe this is why.
[00:28.260 --> 00:31.880]  Well, you're kind of leaving me hanging here, Nick, if we don't finish the fucking game.
[00:32.720 --> 00:36.080]  Well, I think we're going to be hanging, because there's a lot left in this game.
[00:36.080 --> 00:36.920]  I would just plow through.
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.220]  Yeah, I think we're just going to have to fucking do it, is what I'm saying.
[00:40.400 --> 00:42.700]  I mean, we don't have to all do it every week from here on out,
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.280]  but I think we should come back to it regularly.
[00:45.120 --> 00:47.200]  Okay, I'm down for that. I'm absolutely down for that.
[00:47.440 --> 00:50.640]  I don't want to do that thing we did back in the day at Achievement Hunter.
[00:50.820 --> 00:53.320]  And listen, we did it because of me, largely.
[00:54.060 --> 00:54.620]  Oh, okay.
[00:54.620 --> 00:59.180]  But I hated doing the thing where we would put out part 1 and 2 or 3 of something,
[00:59.380 --> 01:03.000]  and then we would cancel it because it did dog shit, and then...
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.960]  I would just never get to know the end of stuff.
[01:05.140 --> 01:07.300]  It just personally annoys me, so I don't want to do it.
[01:07.500 --> 01:09.240]  Oh, then yeah, I would love to come back.
[01:09.380 --> 01:13.740]  I think we got like 80% through one of those Until Dawn-style games,
[01:13.860 --> 01:16.040]  and we weren't allowed to finish it.
[01:19.540 --> 01:20.960]  That sounds like it was post-me.
[01:21.960 --> 01:22.280]  Yeah.
[01:23.860 --> 01:26.480]  I mean, if you get that far in a game, shouldn't you just finish it?
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.280]  You would think so.
[01:29.560 --> 01:32.460]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.940]  I just hate going back and looking at our old catalog and seeing like part 1, part 2, part 3 of...
[01:37.940 --> 01:39.040]  Oh, that's it. Just part 3.
[01:39.360 --> 01:40.780]  There was 18 hours of game left, but...
[01:42.580 --> 01:45.820]  Okay, well now that we've fixed all that stuff, let me start the video officially.
[01:46.080 --> 01:50.560]  Hello, and welcome to the final video of The Last of Us for Halloween.
[01:50.560 --> 01:56.000]  We'll come back to this at a certain point, but we did this for four straight weeks,
[01:56.020 --> 01:57.500]  and we'll be putting this final one out.
[01:57.680 --> 02:00.380]  We'll come back to it whenever we have time in the future.
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.380]  We made special time for it.
[02:02.620 --> 02:05.540]  We normally record the podcast, actually, an hour before this,
[02:05.640 --> 02:10.000]  so we actually had to move the podcast record time up for this special stream.
[02:10.060 --> 02:12.840]  Yeah, we haven't done the podcast the normal time in the whole month, I think.
[02:13.580 --> 02:19.740]  I kind of like the way it's been going, though, because we do a Let's Play and then immediately roll into the podcast.
[02:19.740 --> 02:25.400]  So I feel like the Let's Play lubes us up, and then we just slide right into podcast fun, you know?
[02:26.060 --> 02:26.100]  Yeah.
[02:26.180 --> 02:26.500]  Oh, yeah!
[02:26.620 --> 02:29.440]  And then it's just super lubed up the whole time.
[02:29.600 --> 02:32.720]  We don't have to do any lubricating at the beginning of the podcast,
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.200]  because we go into it lathered, head-to-toe, in lube.
[02:39.360 --> 02:40.060]  There we are!
[02:40.080 --> 02:40.660]  See what I'm saying?
[02:41.520 --> 02:45.720]  So we're fully lubed the entire podcast. There's no lubricating, period.
[02:46.340 --> 02:47.520]  We are slick.
[02:47.520 --> 02:50.920]  And all five of us were supposed to be here for the stream.
[02:51.320 --> 02:51.720]  As usual.
[02:51.880 --> 02:52.260]  Yes!
[02:55.040 --> 02:56.840]  Hey, you two haven't missed one of these.
[02:56.940 --> 02:57.860]  No, no.
[02:57.980 --> 02:58.520]  Nor would we.
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.300]  Gavin and I are true blue, man.
[03:00.900 --> 03:01.140]  Whoa!
[03:01.300 --> 03:03.000]  Oh, shit. That thing blew up.
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.900]  I think it tripped a mine here.
[03:07.760 --> 03:09.360]  Does it look better now on the stream?
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.660]  I feel like that one over there, the clicker in the distance, would have been alerted to that.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.620]  Yeah! Oh, this'll be good.
[03:16.440 --> 03:17.720]  Bait him. Bait him.
[03:17.980 --> 03:19.120]  Oh, Jesus!
[03:19.420 --> 03:20.440]  Ooh, man.
[03:21.240 --> 03:21.960]  Just pop.
[03:22.960 --> 03:24.040]  Pop like a lemon.
[03:24.780 --> 03:25.260]  Oh!
[03:26.920 --> 03:27.880]  Oh, shit!
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.640]  You know, I think that's a thing that only happens in movies. It doesn't really happen in real life.
[03:33.660 --> 03:37.840]  When you step on a landmine and then it doesn't trigger until you take your foot off.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.200]  I think they just blow up immediately in the way it really works.
[03:41.780 --> 03:46.200]  I think that's totally a plot device for film, which would be great for that draft we did.
[03:47.480 --> 03:51.660]  Oh, we only... we did do movie. We could do TV next.
[03:51.820 --> 03:53.420]  Although, I guess they kind of follow the same rules.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.700]  We could do it. We're going to do a second one anyway because there was so much.
[03:55.780 --> 03:58.580]  But that's a good one. That's pretty easy for you guys that remember it.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.400]  Oh, I remember all of it. It was so good.
[04:02.900 --> 04:04.620]  Have we talked about that draft publicly?
[04:04.920 --> 04:05.740]  I think maybe.
[04:06.640 --> 04:10.220]  I think we came up with the idea for it in this, in one of these streams.
[04:11.740 --> 04:16.940]  We did come up for the idea of the draft in a video we were all in.
[04:19.000 --> 04:20.120]  So it might have been this.
[04:20.340 --> 04:21.720]  Or I pitched it to you guys.
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.680]  Because I had... because Andrew and I had already come up with a list of stuff a long time ago.
[04:29.300 --> 04:29.840]  Thanks for the subs.
[04:29.840 --> 04:32.940]  I'll tell you, I was adding stuff to the last minute.
[04:33.280 --> 04:37.860]  Things that I actually watched the night before made the list.
[04:38.080 --> 04:38.440]  Oh, wow.
[04:39.080 --> 04:41.000]  Oh, Guy W2 said, yep, Geoff is correct.
[04:41.080 --> 04:42.580]  Once you step on a mine, it's already activated.
[04:42.700 --> 04:45.580]  So it's one step on the mine, second step on heaven's door.
[04:53.540 --> 04:55.440]  Hey, Natombor, yeah, you got to read Andrew's newsletter.
[04:55.860 --> 04:59.960]  We've been doing this every Thursday at 4 p.m. Central for the month of October.
[05:00.880 --> 05:04.360]  For spooky Halloween month, Nick has been playing The Last of Us.
[05:04.480 --> 05:05.880]  It's a game about zombies. They're spooky.
[05:06.720 --> 05:07.300]  Loads of zombies.
[05:07.300 --> 05:11.480]  Nova Grace says, four months of supporting Geoff, Andrew, Nick, and sadly Eric.
[05:15.420 --> 05:16.260]  Not Gavin, though.
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.080]  Wait, what?
[05:20.440 --> 05:22.640]  Didn't you say Geoff, Andrew, Nick, and sadly Eric?
[05:22.980 --> 05:24.400]  Did I skip my own name?
[05:25.380 --> 05:26.280]  Oh, I suck.
[05:29.800 --> 05:30.240]  Oh, look.
[05:32.200 --> 05:34.780]  Right when somebody said, where are all the MILFs?
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.420]  There they are.
[05:38.260 --> 05:40.780]  Do you think there's a mod to get those onto the zombies?
[05:43.020 --> 05:45.040]  Come on, mod community, what are you doing?
[05:45.580 --> 05:46.180]  Yeah, come on.
[05:46.300 --> 05:48.460]  Come on, MILF mod community, what are you doing?
[05:52.910 --> 05:53.950]  They're in high demand.
[05:54.170 --> 05:54.830]  Alright, let's see.
[05:55.210 --> 05:56.430]  Reload this. Oh, that's not that.
[05:58.250 --> 06:00.810]  Once again, trying to remember all the controls.
[06:02.090 --> 06:06.850]  GTA can really fuck with you if you play other video games, I feel like.
[06:06.850 --> 06:12.250]  GTA, I just downloaded the DLC for Alan Wake 2.
[06:13.050 --> 06:15.530]  All Bethesda games are wonky.
[06:16.290 --> 06:17.210]  Was that a second DLC?
[06:18.190 --> 06:19.070]  Yeah, just came out.
[06:19.190 --> 06:21.490]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[06:22.250 --> 06:22.550]  Thank you!
[06:23.150 --> 06:25.150]  Yeah, it just came out. Tuesday.
[06:26.250 --> 06:27.850]  I've been playing the DLC to Factorio.
[06:30.710 --> 06:32.990]  Although I haven't actually got to the DLC yet.
[06:33.710 --> 06:36.230]  I started a new world and it takes a long time to get there.
[06:37.610 --> 06:39.790]  I'm totally off video games right now.
[06:40.190 --> 06:40.790]  That's crazy.
[06:41.170 --> 06:41.210]  Really?
[06:41.370 --> 06:44.210]  Yeah, I mean, for work, obviously, you know, in the daytime.
[06:44.430 --> 06:49.290]  But at night, not for any reason other than I've just been enjoying watching sports and playing with my baseball cards.
[06:50.190 --> 06:52.030]  I've got lots of organizing to do.
[06:52.030 --> 06:55.250]  I've been playing Astro Bot on my PlayStation Portal.
[06:55.810 --> 07:01.990]  And I get about 20 to 30 minutes in and then it drops the connection to my PlayStation and then I put it down.
[07:02.670 --> 07:05.130]  Is that a fun game? Everybody's talking about it like it's amazing.
[07:05.770 --> 07:10.130]  Yeah, I like it so far. It's very... I don't know, it just feels nice. It's a nice game.
[07:10.470 --> 07:12.950]  Yeah, but you're saying probably not good for a video?
[07:14.630 --> 07:15.190]  I don't think so.
[07:16.310 --> 07:17.190]  It's not very difficult.
[07:17.850 --> 07:18.670]  It's pretty low stakes.
[07:18.690 --> 07:18.810]  Oh, really?
[07:19.810 --> 07:22.250]  What if we went for the Platinum Trophy?
[07:22.890 --> 07:24.230]  That would take a while. Go for it.
[07:24.470 --> 07:30.530]  What if the person who played it had to have their eyes closed and Andrew had to give them directions on what to do?
[07:30.570 --> 07:30.870]  Jeez.
[07:35.130 --> 07:37.130]  I mean, I'll... we can test it.
[07:37.910 --> 07:41.150]  Maybe Eric... what if it's Andrew directing Eric?
[07:42.150 --> 07:43.930]  Oh, or Eric directing Andrew.
[07:44.410 --> 07:44.810]  Oh.
[07:46.070 --> 07:47.350]  You know what? That's the better option.
[07:48.210 --> 07:49.970]  I bet Eric would refuse to do that.
[07:51.860 --> 07:55.730]  Hell, he couldn't even show up here today. Bacon. Fake electricity problems.
[07:57.770 --> 07:59.190]  Oh, a stink fly.
[08:00.090 --> 08:00.650]  Mm-mm-mm.
[08:02.430 --> 08:03.370]  Stink fly.
[08:05.810 --> 08:06.290]  Oh.
[08:06.290 --> 08:08.670]  Oh, God.
[08:08.870 --> 08:10.510]  Jesus Christ, Nick.
[08:11.130 --> 08:12.110]  What have you been drinking?
[08:13.250 --> 08:14.210]  I'm drinking...
[08:14.210 --> 08:14.750]  Carrot juice?
[08:15.670 --> 08:16.250]  I wish.
[08:16.490 --> 08:19.090]  This is the H-E-B Twist. Zero sugar.
[08:19.310 --> 08:19.990]  Oh, that stuff's pretty good.
[08:20.690 --> 08:23.970]  Yeah, it's good. It's the equivalent of like a 7-Up or a Sprite.
[08:24.210 --> 08:24.890]  Yeah. Yeah.
[08:26.210 --> 08:29.630]  Hispanically Delicious just gifted five subs. Thank you very much.
[08:32.440 --> 08:33.220]  Thank you!
[08:33.700 --> 08:35.320]  Alright. End of cutscene.
[08:36.060 --> 08:38.260]  Dina's sick. What's wrong? She threw up. Oh, no.
[08:40.140 --> 08:41.240]  Anyway, we'll find out later.
[08:44.720 --> 08:50.180]  Sorry, I always... Oh, look! This is an instance where backtracking proved helpful.
[08:50.560 --> 08:51.580]  Hell yeah, dude. Congratulations.
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.380]  We got a quarter of a bottle. Thank you.
[08:56.480 --> 08:57.280]  So, I've been...
[08:58.760 --> 09:02.600]  A lot of my teams are bad or they've lost recently.
[09:02.740 --> 09:05.500]  So, the Phillies are out of the playoffs. So, for me, baseball ended a while ago.
[09:05.500 --> 09:10.800]  And then the Cowboys are dog shit.
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.460]  Yeah, they're not great. You guys paid so much money for Dak Prescott to be such a fucking mid-level player.
[09:16.780 --> 09:21.820]  He is so-so and I've always thought he was so-so and he has moments.
[09:22.860 --> 09:29.240]  But I think the playoff game last year really showed me he just can't get it done when it matters.
[09:29.820 --> 09:34.020]  Apparently, it showed Jerry that you should give him more money.
[09:34.020 --> 09:42.580]  I guess so, man. Maybe we'll get in the Arch Manning conversation in like five years.
[09:42.740 --> 09:43.220]  Yeah, maybe.
[09:44.980 --> 09:48.300]  Our arthritic gamer just blew the hype train's penis off.
[09:48.800 --> 09:49.240]  Whoa!
[09:50.580 --> 09:51.560]  Ten gifted subs.
[09:51.840 --> 09:52.600]  Holy shit!
[09:52.820 --> 09:53.620]  Halfway through level seven.
[09:54.860 --> 09:56.740]  Chugga, chugga, thank you!
[09:58.440 --> 10:04.820]  But, as a result, and then the Longhorns lost to Georgia in kind of an embarrassing home game.
[10:04.940 --> 10:07.340]  Yeah, and then they littered the field with trash.
[10:07.560 --> 10:09.840]  And now all the play... Have you seen what they're doing to that?
[10:10.260 --> 10:11.180]  Do you know about this, Gavin?
[10:11.540 --> 10:11.940]  No.
[10:12.480 --> 10:15.080]  So, there was some pretty... I guess some questionable calls.
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.060]  I didn't watch the game.
[10:16.200 --> 10:17.740]  It was a terrible call. That call was bad.
[10:17.840 --> 10:25.620]  But some of the students... It was UT in Austin hosting the University of Georgia who is one of the best teams in...
[10:25.620 --> 10:27.820]  Actually, UT is supposed to be one of the best teams in college football, too.
[10:28.180 --> 10:29.860]  Yeah, it was a matchup of one versus five.
[10:29.980 --> 10:35.280]  I can't talk any shit. My team this year sucks. Alabama has already lost two games.
[10:35.660 --> 10:40.040]  But, anyway, so, Georgia's kind of kicking the dog shit out of Texas.
[10:40.360 --> 10:43.300]  And there's a pretty bad call, as I understand it.
[10:43.440 --> 10:50.540]  And so, kids in the stadium, Austinite college kids, started chucking trash onto the field,
[10:50.680 --> 10:53.920]  which is just something you don't do in football.
[10:53.920 --> 11:01.640]  You do it in baseball in double-A once every couple years.
[11:01.720 --> 11:02.580]  It doesn't happen.
[11:03.460 --> 11:06.120]  And so, they had to stop the game and clear the field.
[11:06.580 --> 11:08.900]  And so, the NCAA is fucking pissed.
[11:09.020 --> 11:13.160]  So, they fined the University of Texas $250,000, which is a lot of money.
[11:13.220 --> 11:15.700]  But it's fucking nothing for UT because they've got oil money.
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.180]  But the other thing they're doing is they're pouring over...
[11:21.180 --> 11:25.540]  They've created a team of people whose job it is to pour over all of the video footage
[11:25.540 --> 11:30.300]  and identify every student who participated in the trash throwing.
[11:30.800 --> 11:38.180]  And then banning them instantly from attending UT football games for the rest of the year without any repercussion.
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.620]  They just get an email that says you've been identified as a person throwing trash on the field. You've been banned.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.120]  That kind of sucks.
[11:45.280 --> 11:47.060]  So, how are they going to ID everyone going in?
[11:48.280 --> 11:50.760]  They have video footage of the whole fucking game, I guess.
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.960]  They have video of that whole section, so they'll probably just...
[11:55.880 --> 11:57.820]  How do they stop you from going in?
[11:59.260 --> 12:00.380]  Oh, I guess they... I don't know.
[12:00.600 --> 12:02.300]  You have to have tickets probably to get in, right?
[12:02.500 --> 12:03.360]  I imagine...
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.120]  Yeah, if they're season ticket holders, those are probably revoked.
[12:08.260 --> 12:10.040]  They might be able to get around it with...
[12:10.040 --> 12:14.720]  I'm sure you can sneak in the way any crafty college student can do.
[12:15.740 --> 12:18.920]  That sucks. I mean, they're kids. That sucks.
[12:18.920 --> 12:26.320]  I didn't like that they threw shit on the field, but in a rare instance of things working out in a weird way...
[12:26.320 --> 12:34.180]  As a result, it took so long for the next play to happen, because a bunch of people came onto the field to clean everything up,
[12:34.560 --> 12:42.560]  that they went ahead and the refs all met on the field and actually changed the call of the play.
[12:42.640 --> 12:43.080]  It's true.
[12:43.260 --> 12:48.700]  Because the refs can get together and have a conversation about what to do in a situation like that.
[12:48.700 --> 12:51.800]  If someone owns up to it or is like, you know what? I think that was a bad call. Let's undo this.
[12:51.940 --> 12:55.600]  But they have to do it before the next play happens. If the next play runs, then that is moot.
[12:55.740 --> 12:58.740]  Everything that happened before then is set in stone.
[12:59.120 --> 13:02.380]  So before the next play happened, all that shit happened. They got together.
[13:02.980 --> 13:08.000]  I assume they were talking about penalizing Texas for the kids throwing shit on the field.
[13:08.580 --> 13:17.320]  And then instead, they reversed the call and Texas got the ball back on the goal line, essentially.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.020]  That is true.
[13:18.020 --> 13:19.720]  Still lost the game.
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.020]  Still lost the game.
[13:21.440 --> 13:23.500]  Did you just file off the serial number?
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.260]  Oh yeah. Can't have any zombies tracking where we are.
[13:27.460 --> 13:29.180]  30 years past cops.
[13:32.820 --> 13:37.380]  If I lived in this town, I'd be committing old world felonies left and right just for the hell of it.
[13:37.500 --> 13:38.180]  Just because you could?
[13:38.380 --> 13:38.820]  Yeah.
[13:39.360 --> 13:41.960]  Just fucking parking in front of fire hydrants constantly?
[13:42.080 --> 13:44.200]  I only park in front of fire hydrants in 2030.
[13:45.260 --> 13:46.860]  In a post-apocalyptic world.
[13:46.860 --> 13:51.300]  Oh, look guys. I bet we can find some stuff in this old shop.
[13:54.100 --> 13:59.020]  I don't know how to say your name. Resonantendall said, Gavin, please save us from sports talk.
[13:59.520 --> 13:59.940]  Oh, sorry.
[14:00.900 --> 14:04.260]  Gavin, do you want to talk about your butthole or anything?
[14:05.100 --> 14:07.600]  I think all the butthole news came out in yesterday's episode.
[14:08.080 --> 14:10.580]  Oh yeah, it did.
[14:11.680 --> 14:12.920]  206-505-01
[14:15.220 --> 14:22.800]  The reason I brought that up, though, is to get off the subject of sports and say that I've been watching British panel comedy shows.
[14:23.200 --> 14:25.360]  Which ones? Wait, Jeremy Dooley?
[14:26.180 --> 14:30.000]  Mostly 8 Out of 10 Cats, or Does Countdown.
[14:31.120 --> 14:32.400]  Will I die if this thing gets me?
[14:32.600 --> 14:38.580]  I love the American's watching 8 Out of 10 Cats, Does Countdown, who have never seen 8 Out of 10 Cats or Countdown.
[14:39.780 --> 14:42.080]  Oh, I watch 8 Out of 10 Cats as well.
[14:42.080 --> 14:49.400]  And then also just the Big Fat Quiz of the year, because it's good. I love that show.
[14:49.500 --> 14:49.980]  Big and fat.
[14:50.120 --> 15:03.320]  Anyway, I wish the U.S. had some equivalent. And I think really the only thing we ever had that was close was, I guess, what was the show with Colin Quinn?
[15:04.080 --> 15:04.300]  Tough Crowd?
[15:04.300 --> 15:04.880]  Geoff, do you remember that?
[15:05.080 --> 15:06.080]  Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn?
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.820]  That's probably the closest we've gotten.
[15:08.920 --> 15:10.340]  Fucking awesome show, too.
[15:10.420 --> 15:11.240]  Yeah, it was a great show.
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.180]  You know what's weird, though?
[15:12.420 --> 15:13.040]  Do you have an F with...
[15:13.040 --> 15:13.880]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Gavin.
[15:14.420 --> 15:15.900]  Do you have an F with Taskmaster, Nick?
[15:16.400 --> 15:18.720]  Oh, I love Taskmaster. It's so good.
[15:18.940 --> 15:19.480]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[15:19.840 --> 15:23.340]  So many people who are on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn are dead now.
[15:24.380 --> 15:25.000]  What, they die off?
[15:25.020 --> 15:25.840]  Oh, that, yeah.
[15:26.060 --> 15:27.100]  It's different comedy shit.
[15:27.580 --> 15:28.220]  What was it?
[15:28.500 --> 15:31.580]  Heart attacks, drug, overdoses, all kinds of stuff.
[15:32.260 --> 15:33.940]  I wasn't paying attention when I was looking at this.
[15:34.020 --> 15:34.940]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[15:37.180 --> 15:39.660]  I need to find this stupid...
[15:42.100 --> 15:44.840]  I was in the middle of a story and I was like, remember this number?
[15:44.960 --> 15:45.940]  And then I completely forgot it.
[15:46.020 --> 15:46.540]  Let's see.
[15:46.820 --> 15:47.500]  Not that.
[15:49.080 --> 15:51.900]  Well, if we've already read it, it's not going to be a highlighted one.
[15:52.840 --> 15:55.060]  No, I read it on the... yeah, shit.
[15:56.940 --> 15:58.540]  You're streaming your tax return.
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.960]  All right, let's see.
[16:01.960 --> 16:05.000]  This to the CPA, and this to the CPA.
[16:08.420 --> 16:08.920]  Oh.
[16:10.560 --> 16:15.300]  Oh, somebody named Shuts67 says, after midnight, similar, they think.
[16:15.620 --> 16:17.140]  Also, somebody mentioned Hollywood Squares.
[16:17.260 --> 16:19.320]  That's a great fucking point.
[16:19.420 --> 16:20.080]  Hollywood Squares.
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.560]  I wish it would come back.
[16:21.720 --> 16:25.700]  It always makes its way back around every once in a while, I feel like.
[16:26.200 --> 16:27.040]  What was that one?
[16:28.980 --> 16:34.560]  It's a show where they have like... I don't know how to describe it.
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.160]  You know the intro to the Brady Bunch where it had all the kids stacked on top of each other?
[16:39.880 --> 16:43.420]  It's a set like that, but in each square is a celebrity.
[16:44.180 --> 16:45.100]  Blankety Blank.
[16:45.460 --> 16:48.020]  Yeah, sure. Blankety Blank. Yeah.
[16:48.540 --> 16:49.620]  Yeah, it's Blankety Blank.
[16:52.300 --> 16:54.000]  Oh, is it Supermarket Apology?
[16:54.560 --> 16:56.420]  Blankety Blank, hosted by Lily Savage.
[16:57.520 --> 16:58.760]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[16:59.740 --> 17:02.760]  I don't remember. Can anyone in the chat remember what the fucking code was?
[17:03.260 --> 17:04.060]  Are you shitting me?
[17:04.380 --> 17:06.100]  Was it 266 something or other?
[17:06.680 --> 17:08.300]  I remember 555 in the middle.
[17:09.060 --> 17:10.840]  The last two numbers were 11, I believe.
[17:15.460 --> 17:16.300]  Fuck me.
[17:16.700 --> 17:17.360]  Oh, Nick.
[17:17.820 --> 17:19.800]  Why did I...
[17:19.800 --> 17:20.900]  Do you just not have it?
[17:22.580 --> 17:23.000]  I...
[17:24.600 --> 17:25.560]  I have to have it.
[17:25.560 --> 17:27.060]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.260]  You know what?
[17:29.380 --> 17:29.980]  We're way off.
[17:31.040 --> 17:32.540]  206, 555, 01.
[17:32.860 --> 17:33.620]  We had some of those numbers.
[17:35.200 --> 17:38.200]  Made the comma the last six digits of Stacey's phone number.
[17:39.500 --> 17:39.980]  5501?
[17:41.160 --> 17:42.760]  5501 and then two that were missing.
[17:43.240 --> 17:44.960]  Oh, that would be 01.
[17:46.420 --> 17:50.620]  Gavin, what is British Family Feud called? It's called Family Fortunes.
[17:50.620 --> 17:52.380]  56, 5501.
[17:52.860 --> 17:54.640]  The last six digits, 5501.
[17:54.780 --> 17:56.360]  Maybe it's still pinned to the wall.
[17:57.260 --> 17:58.040]  It is not.
[17:59.320 --> 18:00.040]  Uh-oh.
[18:00.880 --> 18:01.600]  Ah, shit.
[18:01.880 --> 18:04.460]  It's funny because the audience has said it already.
[18:04.800 --> 18:05.220]  Oh, have they?
[18:05.360 --> 18:06.360]  Yeah, I can tell you.
[18:06.420 --> 18:08.300]  But I feel like it's more fun if you learn it yourself.
[18:09.700 --> 18:10.020]  Cool.
[18:10.620 --> 18:12.760]  Well, who wants to sit here for the next few...
[18:13.160 --> 18:13.520]  420.
[18:15.600 --> 18:15.960]  55...
[18:17.900 --> 18:18.260]  01...
[18:21.900 --> 18:22.860]  and then...
[18:25.420 --> 18:25.900]  01...
[18:29.150 --> 18:30.110]  and then...
[18:30.110 --> 18:30.750]  Oh, Christ.
[18:33.790 --> 18:34.950]  What do you think it is?
[18:36.430 --> 18:37.250]  What do you mean?
[18:38.030 --> 18:38.910]  What do you think it is?
[18:39.430 --> 18:40.790]  Well, wasn't 11 at the end?
[18:41.410 --> 18:43.810]  No, because we're missing the last two digits.
[18:45.090 --> 18:46.970]  The last two digits are missing.
[18:49.830 --> 18:51.630]  Seeing a lot of different...
[18:51.630 --> 18:52.970]  Seeing a lot of different stuff.
[18:53.190 --> 18:54.090]  It's not 2-3.
[18:57.730 --> 19:00.610]  You got it, Nick. Only 99 combinations, says GuyW2.
[19:01.890 --> 19:04.590]  You just have to type in the first part every time.
[19:05.650 --> 19:05.850]  Yeah.
[19:06.430 --> 19:09.250]  Can Nick brute-force this safe before the stream ends?
[19:10.110 --> 19:11.330]  I'm gonna get it. Here we go.
[19:12.350 --> 19:13.870]  Thanks to a...
[19:13.870 --> 19:16.390]  very helpful regulation viewer.
[19:16.830 --> 19:20.030]  I didn't see where they went.
[19:21.550 --> 19:23.290]  Thank you, RG20TV.
[19:24.030 --> 19:29.570]  Thank you. Oh, this is great. Look at this, guys. Without that, we'd be totally boned. Reload.
[19:29.670 --> 19:31.490]  It was just a fricking bit of ammo?
[19:32.670 --> 19:34.670]  Yeah, but ammo's like gold in this world.
[19:35.010 --> 19:36.430]  Yeah, this is... Are you kidding me?
[19:37.110 --> 19:40.750]  I have multiple guns with bullets? This is insane.
[19:41.170 --> 19:44.670]  Yeah, but I watch you panic shoot them over the shoulders of many infected.
[19:45.550 --> 19:48.150]  Well, I've upgraded the stability of a couple of the guns.
[19:48.310 --> 19:48.810]  Hell yeah.
[19:48.810 --> 19:49.870]  Hell yeah!
[19:50.130 --> 19:50.950]  Watch out, there's a...
[19:50.950 --> 19:53.090]  See if you can hurdle that string.
[19:53.970 --> 19:56.810]  Yeah, I've tried. You cannot hurdle them. You can only go...
[19:57.990 --> 19:59.190]  over and around.
[20:02.760 --> 20:04.480]  Can I crawl under the truck? I cannot.
[20:05.080 --> 20:06.920]  You know what this place needs?
[20:07.100 --> 20:07.740]  It needs that dude...
[20:07.740 --> 20:08.460]  Fuck! Oh!
[20:09.360 --> 20:09.880]  That sucked.
[20:11.320 --> 20:12.480]  I hope not.
[20:12.740 --> 20:15.440]  And that's a great example of why it needs it, Nick.
[20:15.440 --> 20:20.900]  This place needs that dude on TikTok who goes around to abandoned houses and cuts the grass.
[20:21.160 --> 20:22.440]  Oh, well...
[20:25.260 --> 20:27.100]  You'd be able to see all these landmines.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.820]  Alright, how close can I be?
[20:36.720 --> 20:38.580]  Oh, you're asking about Taskmaster, Gavin?
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.540]  I discovered that because during lockdown they started releasing episodes on YouTube.
[20:43.960 --> 20:44.360]  There you go.
[20:44.360 --> 20:51.260]  And I had a friend who was a big British panel show guy before I was.
[20:51.340 --> 20:52.380]  And he was like, you gotta watch this.
[20:52.460 --> 20:53.220]  I was like, yeah, I'll get to it.
[20:53.240 --> 20:56.480]  And two years later I finally binged it, basically, from the beginning.
[20:59.280 --> 21:01.100]  But one, Alex Horne's insane.
[21:01.660 --> 21:03.100]  And Greg Davies is very funny.
[21:04.700 --> 21:06.100]  He's like six foot eight.
[21:06.740 --> 21:10.480]  Dude, he is a strangely shaped man.
[21:11.140 --> 21:11.800]  Is that the principal?
[21:12.600 --> 21:13.340]  Yeah, Mr. Gilbert.
[21:16.990 --> 21:19.590]  Oh, that's right. He's from Inbetweeners, right?
[21:19.870 --> 21:20.270]  Inbetweeners.
[21:20.470 --> 21:21.110]  Did you ever watch that?
[21:21.770 --> 21:22.390]  I did not.
[21:22.750 --> 21:23.150]  Oh, dude, you should.
[21:24.670 --> 21:25.310]  Legendary show.
[21:25.650 --> 21:28.170]  Seems like that would draw zombies' attention to you.
[21:28.950 --> 21:29.350]  Yeah.
[21:31.910 --> 21:33.030]  I think you would think so.
[21:33.170 --> 21:34.070]  Wait, you know what?
[21:34.370 --> 21:36.890]  That van's a-rockin'. Be careful.
[21:37.650 --> 21:39.310]  Oh, don't go a-knockin'.
[21:40.870 --> 21:43.770]  Can you imagine if you... Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
[21:43.950 --> 21:47.590]  Can you imagine if you were a couple of teenagers in a van with carpet
[21:47.590 --> 21:50.430]  and you were listening to your 8-track and fuckin' going at it?
[21:50.770 --> 21:53.830]  Having fun van sex.
[21:54.050 --> 21:56.530]  And then you open the doors afterward and it's like 30 years later
[21:56.530 --> 21:57.830]  and you're in the middle of this.
[21:59.870 --> 22:01.850]  That would suck.
[22:03.050 --> 22:04.030]  Did you have an 8-track?
[22:06.930 --> 22:10.270]  Uh, I... Yes, at one point in my life there was one in my house, yeah.
[22:12.630 --> 22:15.230]  Not like in a vehicle, but there was like a home one.
[22:16.510 --> 22:19.250]  Good for if you want to suddenly switch to the middle of a different song.
[22:19.850 --> 22:20.290]  Yeah.
[22:21.930 --> 22:23.090]  We're going up there.
[22:23.890 --> 22:24.430]  Hell yeah.
[22:24.870 --> 22:25.590]  Hell yeah.
[22:26.070 --> 22:28.410]  We've reached the TV station.
[22:29.310 --> 22:32.130]  Would you guys ever bring Buckley back for content?
[22:32.130 --> 22:34.670]  He was my favorite A.H. guest. He wishes.
[22:37.090 --> 22:38.270]  We saw him recently, didn't we?
[22:38.510 --> 22:41.410]  Yeah, we did. It was great. I really enjoyed hanging out with him.
[22:42.090 --> 22:42.890]  He's a funny dude.
[22:43.430 --> 22:43.910]  It was at the wedding?
[22:46.370 --> 22:48.290]  Not balls. Not that way.
[22:52.510 --> 22:53.430]  Back up here.
[22:54.270 --> 22:56.990]  You gotta be careful, Nick. A sprained ankle in this world can kill you.
[22:57.490 --> 22:59.470]  Seriously, you're done for, right?
[22:59.470 --> 23:01.910]  Yeah, you're not getting away from anything.
[23:02.450 --> 23:07.050]  It's funny, in the game, it's like, oh, it's a game. They'll cut the in-between beats, no problem.
[23:07.370 --> 23:09.690]  But in the show, they really gave you that sense of...
[23:10.890 --> 23:11.310]  You okay?
[23:12.030 --> 23:13.890]  The stream just shot itself on my screen.
[23:13.970 --> 23:14.130]  Oh.
[23:18.770 --> 23:20.110]  I hope it's not...
[23:20.110 --> 23:23.090]  Oh, that guy's dead as dicks.
[23:24.290 --> 23:29.170]  Andrew has internet issues. Eric has power issues. Both of them have attendance issues.
[23:37.360 --> 23:40.420]  Go... I should know this. Just... oh. Rope.
[23:42.940 --> 23:46.660]  I'm trying to push the action button, which is usually triangle.
[23:47.020 --> 23:48.880]  Now spin upside down, like Rainbow Six style.
[23:50.120 --> 23:53.220]  You know how you shit yourself the other day, Gav?
[23:53.640 --> 23:54.200]  Yeah, big time.
[23:55.320 --> 24:01.800]  How long is the amount of time between you shitting yourself and the previous time you'd shit yourself?
[24:02.940 --> 24:04.020]  Just a rough estimate.
[24:04.600 --> 24:08.340]  I think the previous time I shit myself was the day of six shits.
[24:09.620 --> 24:12.120]  So, what's that like, 11 years?
[24:12.940 --> 24:13.780]  Yeah, 11 years.
[24:14.200 --> 24:19.340]  Here's a comforting thought for you. It's not gonna be 11 years before you shit yourself again.
[24:20.180 --> 24:24.020]  You're not gonna break that record. You'll shit yourself sooner than that, I promise you.
[24:24.560 --> 24:26.500]  I wonder if that is my record, actually.
[24:26.500 --> 24:32.180]  It probably will be. That's a record that will, like, I'll never beat my record, whatever it is, you know?
[24:32.320 --> 24:36.280]  I'll just continue to shit myself with increasing frequency until I die. We all will.
[24:39.360 --> 24:41.540]  Oh, that's kind of a depressing thought.
[24:41.720 --> 24:44.980]  I'm gonna try so hard to not shit myself for 11 years.
[24:45.360 --> 24:48.160]  Good luck, dude, but I don't think... I'd be amazed if you make it for three.
[24:48.740 --> 24:51.300]  I would be 48 at the time of completion.
[24:51.700 --> 24:53.420]  You've uncorked the anus.
[24:55.780 --> 25:00.520]  Should we make a bet right here to see who can be the longest to go without shitting themselves?
[25:00.520 --> 25:04.760]  I mean, I'd love to make the bet. I don't have any chance of winning it, but yeah, I'll make it.
[25:06.180 --> 25:06.580]  Alright.
[25:07.780 --> 25:10.320]  I'll be happy if I make it through the rest of the year without shitting myself.
[25:13.170 --> 25:18.550]  I feel like by putting that on yourself, too, you're opening the door to shit yourself more readily.
[25:19.650 --> 25:22.230]  You just gotta accept it and be ready for it.
[25:22.390 --> 25:26.710]  You gotta be emotionally prepared to shit yourself.
[25:27.890 --> 25:30.270]  ARthriticGamer says I'm 72 and can attest to what Geoff's saying.
[25:30.330 --> 25:32.150]  There you go. First hand experience.
[25:32.330 --> 25:32.490]  Wow.
[25:35.590 --> 25:38.250]  Any more gas station issues? I don't really drive that much lately.
[25:39.050 --> 25:44.710]  Can we get a medal made? Like a 365 shitless day medal for you to try and achieve?
[25:45.850 --> 25:48.230]  It's been X number of days since shitting yourself.
[25:50.990 --> 25:53.710]  Maybe it's gonna be an achievement in the regulation game.
[25:56.110 --> 25:57.790]  365 without shitting your pants.
[25:58.150 --> 26:01.310]  Geoff, where can we get more break shit content? I really miss it.
[26:01.410 --> 26:04.550]  Where else can we get our Zimmer fix? I miss it, too. I miss it, too.
[26:06.410 --> 26:08.810]  You were doing some break stuff on your own for a little bit, weren't you?
[26:08.810 --> 26:12.170]  I was doing a daily on TikTok. I did it for a while.
[26:15.510 --> 26:22.110]  Honestly, regulation is just getting to be enough work now that it's kind of hard to squeeze those little things into the day.
[26:22.510 --> 26:28.150]  They're the first thing that you drop, and then once you drop it and you break your streak, it just falls apart pretty quickly.
[26:28.910 --> 26:32.470]  I'll definitely bring the break show back, whoever that was that asked.
[26:32.470 --> 26:38.990]  I actually talk about that in SolRite this next week's episode, I think, but it won't be until we get an office.
[26:39.250 --> 26:42.050]  And we won't get an office anytime soon.
[26:42.690 --> 26:43.630]  You mean a coffee shop?
[26:43.930 --> 26:46.850]  A coffee shop that lets me put up a permanent set.
[26:49.230 --> 26:52.530]  Colo, subscribe with Prime. That's a whole trimester for Colo.
[26:53.930 --> 26:56.450]  You're a third of the way to being born, Colo. Thank you so much.
[26:57.750 --> 26:58.750]  Okay, congrats.
[26:59.190 --> 27:02.910]  Gav just watched the video on delivery drones. Awesome slurmer. Thanks.
[27:03.250 --> 27:03.870]  Someone's joined!
[27:04.590 --> 27:06.330]  Who is it? Andrew!
[27:06.870 --> 27:08.130]  I heard there were MILFs.
[27:08.950 --> 27:10.510]  The MILFs were last week.
[27:11.010 --> 27:13.570]  I should have titled this stream about MILFs.
[27:13.690 --> 27:14.990]  I picked up some viewers.
[27:16.150 --> 27:16.550]  Hey, Andrew.
[27:16.830 --> 27:18.450]  Are you going on your audio, Andrew?
[27:18.890 --> 27:19.310]  Yeah, I am.
[27:20.650 --> 27:23.630]  Do you think... because we were just having this discussion.
[27:24.130 --> 27:24.810]  You're 30 now.
[27:24.810 --> 27:25.170]  Rarely.
[27:25.530 --> 27:26.890]  When was the last time you shit yourself?
[27:28.470 --> 27:29.230]  Quite a while.
[27:29.850 --> 27:30.750]  More than 11 years?
[27:30.910 --> 27:32.530]  You might be on your best streak.
[27:32.710 --> 27:33.870]  The best streak of your life.
[27:33.890 --> 27:34.770]  More than 11 years?
[27:36.670 --> 27:38.010]  Yeah, I think so.
[27:39.170 --> 27:42.870]  I like that you've more recently almost got a shampoo bottle in your asshole than shat yourself.
[27:43.250 --> 27:44.790]  Yeah, 100%.
[27:45.770 --> 27:48.130]  We'll pick this conversation up next time you shit yourself.
[27:48.670 --> 27:49.070]  Okay.
[27:49.950 --> 27:50.830]  I'll let you know.
[27:52.110 --> 27:52.490]  Let's see.
[27:52.490 --> 27:57.650]  Of the primary three of you, the two of you have shit yourself fairly recently.
[27:57.830 --> 28:00.090]  Yeah, Gavin's wedding and then Gavin the other day.
[28:00.650 --> 28:01.250]  That's right.
[28:04.410 --> 28:05.540]  We're just falling apart.
[28:08.810 --> 28:10.670]  You know, remember that I'm almost 50 joke?
[28:10.830 --> 28:12.290]  I'm almost 50.
[28:13.410 --> 28:15.150]  Like eight months to go or something.
[28:15.330 --> 28:15.930]  Ten months to go.
[28:16.530 --> 28:16.930]  Really?
[28:16.930 --> 28:18.290]  Let's reduce you a half century.
[28:19.290 --> 28:19.990]  Ignore it.
[28:20.270 --> 28:21.030]  Pretend I'm still 30.
[28:21.030 --> 28:21.790]  Okay.
[28:21.790 --> 28:22.470]  What? No.
[28:23.250 --> 28:23.490]  Okay.
[28:23.690 --> 28:24.110]  I mean, yeah.
[28:26.530 --> 28:28.450]  What came out when you were 30?
[28:28.550 --> 28:29.190]  What video game?
[28:31.490 --> 28:34.450]  Can we film a Let's Play in a game and pretend it just came out?
[28:34.750 --> 28:38.570]  We can just film Let's Plays in all the games we were doing Let's Plays in when I was 30.
[28:38.650 --> 28:40.110]  I've been doing this a hundred fucking years.
[28:40.930 --> 28:42.850]  We just played Left 4 Dead the other day.
[28:43.070 --> 28:43.410]  Yeah.
[28:44.490 --> 28:48.790]  We should do Halo at some point.
[28:50.410 --> 28:52.130]  We should do Halo recently.
[28:52.210 --> 28:52.730]  What was that?
[28:53.070 --> 28:54.490]  We should do Pistols on Hang'em High.
[28:55.310 --> 28:56.630]  Oh, dude.
[28:56.710 --> 28:57.490]  That's a great one.
[28:59.690 --> 29:00.850]  Andrew, are you rolling on your audio?
[29:01.210 --> 29:01.370]  Yeah.
[29:01.530 --> 29:02.370]  You already said yeah.
[29:03.250 --> 29:03.770]  You already asked.
[29:03.850 --> 29:04.630]  I forgot if I asked.
[29:05.270 --> 29:05.950]  Hey, Andrew.
[29:06.910 --> 29:07.630]  All right.
[29:07.730 --> 29:07.970]  No.
[29:08.770 --> 29:09.090]  Hey, Gavin.
[29:09.150 --> 29:09.570]  Is this a bit?
[29:09.650 --> 29:10.110]  No, I'm not.
[29:10.450 --> 29:11.150]  No, it's not a bit.
[29:11.830 --> 29:12.070]  Okay.
[29:12.370 --> 29:12.770]  Are you sure?
[29:13.230 --> 29:13.690]  It's a bit.
[29:15.910 --> 29:17.030]  I wish it had been a bit.
[29:17.030 --> 29:21.210]  For Geoff's half century, may I suggest a trip to see the Lions in the Super Bowl?
[29:21.450 --> 29:23.170]  Well, we got a pretty good shot of that, actually.
[29:23.590 --> 29:25.110]  What games came out in 2005?
[29:25.890 --> 29:27.030]  I'd be pretty down for that.
[29:28.330 --> 29:28.810]  2005.
[29:29.670 --> 29:30.630]  Batman Begins.
[29:31.610 --> 29:32.350]  Call of Duty 2.
[29:33.010 --> 29:33.730]  The tie-in.
[29:33.810 --> 29:35.570]  Call of Duty 2 is a great fucking game.
[29:35.990 --> 29:36.750]  Great game.
[29:37.190 --> 29:38.410]  Resident Evil 4.
[29:39.170 --> 29:40.610]  Bratz Rock Angels.
[29:41.070 --> 29:41.490]  Ooh.
[29:42.110 --> 29:42.990]  Fantastic Four.
[29:43.130 --> 29:43.730]  God of War.
[29:43.770 --> 29:44.470]  The first one.
[29:45.570 --> 29:46.950]  From Russia With Love.
[29:47.750 --> 29:48.190]  What?
[29:48.310 --> 29:48.670]  That was a game?
[29:49.130 --> 29:49.510]  Yeah.
[29:49.750 --> 29:51.530]  That was a team call from Russia With Love?
[29:51.670 --> 29:54.170]  And they brought Sean Connery back for it to do all the voiceover.
[29:54.290 --> 29:55.330]  That was like the big deal.
[29:55.830 --> 29:56.150]  That one.
[29:56.210 --> 29:56.510]  What?
[29:57.630 --> 29:58.750]  Oh, the King Kong game.
[30:00.050 --> 30:00.670]  Oh, King Kong.
[30:00.710 --> 30:01.650]  We got a lot to pick from.
[30:02.090 --> 30:03.330]  Was it five achievements?
[30:04.730 --> 30:05.490]  Was that?
[30:05.830 --> 30:06.550]  Fuck, dude.
[30:06.590 --> 30:07.230]  That's crazy.
[30:07.370 --> 30:08.650]  It was that long ago.
[30:10.810 --> 30:11.690]  Burnout Revenge.
[30:11.890 --> 30:12.330]  2005.
[30:12.610 --> 30:13.030]  Great year.
[30:13.030 --> 30:14.170]  Which one's Leah?
[30:15.030 --> 30:18.310]  She was one of the witnesses to Joel's death.
[30:18.910 --> 30:20.610]  Oh, so she a bad guy?
[30:21.670 --> 30:22.690]  She was.
[30:23.470 --> 30:23.990]  Arrowed.
[30:24.370 --> 30:24.730]  Fuck you.
[30:25.110 --> 30:26.510]  We don't know who killed her.
[30:26.930 --> 30:28.090]  Which one was Burnout Revenge?
[30:28.230 --> 30:28.850]  Is that a third one?
[30:30.450 --> 30:31.730]  Is that the second one?
[30:32.530 --> 30:32.950]  I don't know.
[30:32.990 --> 30:34.470]  It's the one we played kind of recently.
[30:34.770 --> 30:35.630]  Which one was Takedown?
[30:38.710 --> 30:39.650]  I don't know.
[30:40.210 --> 30:42.410]  I don't know.
[30:42.410 --> 30:44.990]  Is that Burnout 3 Takedown?
[30:46.190 --> 30:46.790]  I don't know.
[30:47.130 --> 30:49.130]  I think the second one had a really fun crash mode.
[30:50.430 --> 30:51.930]  And then in Paradise it was shite.
[30:52.450 --> 30:53.210]  Paradise, yeah.
[30:54.070 --> 30:55.630]  Oh, we didn't go in this room earlier. Let me see.
[30:56.690 --> 30:58.010]  Burnout 3 Takedown.
[31:00.590 --> 31:02.070]  Yeah, I wasn't a fan of Paradise.
[31:04.910 --> 31:06.390]  I like the races.
[31:07.350 --> 31:10.610]  I think it's a cool idea, the open world thing, but it's not what I want from that.
[31:11.090 --> 31:14.550]  Did you say you like the races or you like the racists?
[31:15.650 --> 31:16.050]  Races.
[31:16.650 --> 31:17.670]  Okay, just wanted to make sure.
[31:17.790 --> 31:21.050]  It's literally the exact opposite of what you requested.
[31:21.370 --> 31:23.770]  Yeah, that's why I needed to clarify.
[31:23.790 --> 31:25.510]  Big fan of each and every one.
[31:25.790 --> 31:27.390]  Great. Glad to hear it.
[31:29.050 --> 31:30.890]  Didn't Jack love Paradise? Yeah, he loved it.
[31:31.210 --> 31:34.030]  I think maybe that's why I like it slightly less.
[31:34.910 --> 31:37.110]  He loved it a little too much.
[31:37.650 --> 31:38.850]  He had a boner for it.
[31:42.940 --> 31:43.980]  So there's people dead here.
[31:44.340 --> 31:45.620]  Do you think you'll kill anyone?
[31:47.060 --> 31:48.540]  I imagine I'll be killed.
[31:49.060 --> 31:50.380]  Sounds like people are talking.
[31:51.180 --> 31:52.080]  Yeah, they're down there.
[31:52.080 --> 31:52.960]  You can save whenever you want.
[31:53.940 --> 31:54.980]  You know what? That's a good call.
[31:55.180 --> 31:56.460]  Yeah, put that save in.
[31:57.900 --> 32:00.160]  Can you reload the one with MILFs?
[32:03.760 --> 32:06.340]  Go ahead and get a health kit made just in case.
[32:06.340 --> 32:13.400]  Rahsaan for Prez says, I wonder if they'll have Ray and for the day call it the Ray-gulation podcast.
[32:13.560 --> 32:16.080]  You don't need to wonder if we'll do that. We won't. We definitely won't do that.
[32:16.640 --> 32:17.540]  Oh, they definitely saw me.
[32:17.820 --> 32:18.460]  That's not going to happen.
[32:18.600 --> 32:23.040]  We might have Ray on to play video games together someday, but not on the podcast.
[32:23.520 --> 32:24.140]  Podcast doesn't have guests.
[32:24.840 --> 32:25.280]  Never will.
[32:26.580 --> 32:28.400]  Unless it does, but it doesn't.
[32:28.680 --> 32:29.000]  So it won't.
[32:30.860 --> 32:32.220]  But rules are made to be broken.
[32:32.320 --> 32:34.340]  But we also like rules, so...
[32:35.820 --> 32:36.500]  Oh, shit.
[32:37.320 --> 32:38.100]  Yeah, it's bad.
[32:38.620 --> 32:39.520]  These guys have rules.
[32:40.960 --> 32:42.000]  Nick's breaking them.
[32:43.440 --> 32:45.920]  A Ray-gulation gameplay would be sick, I agree.
[32:47.460 --> 32:48.080]  That would be cool.
[32:49.680 --> 32:53.420]  Would be fun to hang out and show Ray what real gamers look like again.
[32:56.760 --> 32:58.060]  I'm going to go ahead and just...
[32:58.060 --> 33:01.660]  Will there be more trucks? God damn it, SuperSingleMom8.
[33:02.820 --> 33:05.900]  We just recorded last week trucks.
[33:07.140 --> 33:10.960]  Might have witnessed a mental and emotional breakdown in the middle of that video.
[33:12.620 --> 33:13.860]  Trucks really shot the bed.
[33:14.920 --> 33:15.880]  Really shot my heart.
[33:16.740 --> 33:17.700]  Yeah, there's a lot of shatting.
[33:18.640 --> 33:22.220]  You've had a run of technical difficulties recently, and I feel bad for you.
[33:22.740 --> 33:24.300]  I appreciate it, thank you.
[33:24.920 --> 33:25.400]  I do too.
[33:26.280 --> 33:28.700]  And you had to run that fucking cable across your house.
[33:28.760 --> 33:29.560]  I still do.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.520]  It's running across my house right now.
[33:31.940 --> 33:35.700]  I meant you had to physically run it across your house, and it is continuing to be there.
[33:35.780 --> 33:40.900]  Yeah, I do it every... I mean, I set it up every time we record, and then I take it back down every time I'm done.
[33:41.000 --> 33:41.220]  What?
[33:41.480 --> 33:44.200]  You're like me in 2003 when I had to do that before Wi-Fi.
[33:44.760 --> 33:45.020]  Yeah.
[33:45.980 --> 33:46.620]  Oh, God.
[33:46.780 --> 33:49.860]  I mean, I have Wi-Fi, but you guys won't let me use it, so I have to do the cord.
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.320]  I feel like the Wi-Fi won't let you use it.
[33:53.440 --> 33:53.700]  Yeah.
[33:55.240 --> 33:56.320]  Grab him, dammit!
[33:56.500 --> 33:58.140]  That was crazy, Nick. There's a guy to your right.
[33:58.160 --> 33:59.280]  I did not... oh, oh.
[33:59.300 --> 33:59.440]  Yeah.
[34:00.900 --> 34:02.820]  There's also someone else with a gun behind us.
[34:02.940 --> 34:05.320]  Whoa! Your buddy was sliding all around.
[34:07.220 --> 34:07.540]  That...
[34:08.200 --> 34:10.960]  Hey, did you know that crafting items can save your life when low on ammo?
[34:12.280 --> 34:15.100]  Did we do anything with Bernie when he was in town? I didn't know he was in town.
[34:15.780 --> 34:16.600]  I went on his podcast.
[34:17.360 --> 34:19.780]  Oh, there you go. Gus did something with him. Or Gavin. You're Gavin.
[34:22.760 --> 34:25.180]  I'm almost 50 here, guys. Come on.
[34:26.100 --> 34:29.260]  Yeah, I think I saw... I think it was Monday's episode.
[34:31.140 --> 34:32.580]  Oh, that's right. He does daily, right?
[34:33.600 --> 34:33.800]  Yeah.
[34:34.400 --> 34:34.760]  Yeah.
[34:38.010 --> 34:41.470]  What is his podcast called? Bernie's podcast? It's called Morning Somewhere.
[34:42.390 --> 34:44.470]  And he comes out every day, Monday to Friday?
[34:46.810 --> 34:48.290]  Good God, they're everywhere.
[34:49.490 --> 34:50.090]  The podcasts?
[34:50.890 --> 34:51.410]  Yeah, the podcasts.
[34:51.410 --> 34:52.790]  There are a lot of them.
[34:53.190 --> 34:54.930]  I mean, yeah, they've spread pretty far and wide.
[34:57.830 --> 34:58.230]  My...
[34:58.230 --> 35:02.470]  R30 Gamers is my getting... almost 50 jokes are getting old, like me and Geoff.
[35:05.250 --> 35:08.510]  If I can get this one on the stairs before anyone else comes up.
[35:08.870 --> 35:11.150]  Oh, you got it. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.
[35:11.210 --> 35:13.350]  It didn't let it...
[35:15.530 --> 35:17.750]  Whoa! Swing! Swing!
[35:18.030 --> 35:18.670]  Oh, shit.
[35:19.790 --> 35:20.770]  Stab! Stab! Stab!
[35:20.770 --> 35:22.070]  Stab him up! Stab him up!
[35:22.210 --> 35:22.570]  Yeah!
[35:22.830 --> 35:24.230]  Nice, nice. There's some bullets flying.
[35:24.530 --> 35:24.810]  Oh!
[35:24.810 --> 35:26.170]  Oh, that's not good.
[35:26.330 --> 35:26.990]  Oh, no.
[35:27.090 --> 35:27.490]  Shit.
[35:27.510 --> 35:28.150]  I don't like that.
[35:28.490 --> 35:29.130]  For nothing.
[35:29.770 --> 35:31.090]  You got Sean Beaned.
[35:31.550 --> 35:32.490]  Oh, I did.
[35:32.670 --> 35:34.810]  You could say that in so many different circumstances.
[35:35.110 --> 35:35.330]  Yeah.
[35:35.590 --> 35:37.550]  You're gonna have to be more specific, I'm afraid.
[35:38.930 --> 35:39.650]  Let's try going down.
[35:39.650 --> 35:40.530]  You got Silent Hilled.
[35:44.430 --> 35:47.470]  Hey, regulation friends, what should I eat for dinner tonight?
[35:47.790 --> 35:48.570]  I'm not gonna cook.
[35:48.790 --> 35:49.890]  I've cooked every night this week.
[35:49.890 --> 35:50.730]  I'm gonna order out tonight.
[35:51.430 --> 35:51.830]  Hot dogs.
[35:51.830 --> 35:52.510]  Ooh, what about...
[35:52.510 --> 35:53.610]  I had hot dogs last night.
[35:53.970 --> 35:54.830]  And for lunch today.
[35:54.850 --> 35:55.310]  And today.
[35:55.470 --> 35:56.210]  What about pizza?
[35:57.030 --> 35:59.470]  I'm gonna have pizza tomorrow night for the World Series.
[36:00.090 --> 36:00.590]  Oh, okay.
[36:01.530 --> 36:03.170]  What about pre-pizza?
[36:03.690 --> 36:05.150]  Yeah, I thought about pre-pizza.
[36:05.950 --> 36:06.390]  I did.
[36:08.490 --> 36:09.290]  What about...
[36:09.290 --> 36:15.210]  Oh, what about a nice lasagna?
[36:16.090 --> 36:16.790]  Peruvian food.
[36:16.790 --> 36:20.930]  I did just order from a new Peruvian place the other day, and it was okay.
[36:20.930 --> 36:21.070]  Oh, did you?
[36:21.590 --> 36:22.610]  Yeah, it was just okay.
[36:22.630 --> 36:22.990]  Oh, balls.
[36:23.670 --> 36:24.290]  Fuck me.
[36:24.490 --> 36:25.690]  Rudy's baked potato.
[36:25.970 --> 36:26.470]  That's interesting.
[36:26.550 --> 36:28.210]  My wife doesn't like baked potatoes, though.
[36:29.610 --> 36:31.690]  Well, could she not get something else from there?
[36:32.150 --> 36:33.650]  She's not a big barbecue fan.
[36:37.510 --> 36:38.230]  That's interesting.
[36:39.090 --> 36:44.710]  You know, I've really kind of hit my limit on it the last few years, too.
[36:44.770 --> 36:45.650]  I have it very rarely.
[36:45.650 --> 36:48.990]  I still enjoy it when I eat it, but I crave it so rarely now.
[36:49.490 --> 36:49.850]  Same.
[36:50.450 --> 36:52.690]  I probably crave brisket once a year.
[36:52.910 --> 36:53.870]  Maybe twice a year.
[36:55.410 --> 36:56.370]  Oh, I wonder...
[36:56.370 --> 36:57.630]  Oh, throw a bomb over that.
[36:57.710 --> 36:58.310]  Hell yeah, dude.
[36:58.350 --> 36:59.030]  Blow them all up.
[36:59.690 --> 37:00.470]  That's an achievement, right?
[37:01.370 --> 37:01.970]  If I throw...
[37:01.970 --> 37:04.110]  That was just a distraction bomb.
[37:04.390 --> 37:06.510]  There's no way you're supposed to kill all those people.
[37:06.870 --> 37:07.530]  That would have been amazing.
[37:07.530 --> 37:08.590]  No, I'm gonna try to get past it.
[37:08.690 --> 37:09.250]  You gotta try it.
[37:11.650 --> 37:12.790]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[37:12.810 --> 37:14.950]  When this run ends with a death, we'll do it.
[37:16.750 --> 37:21.110]  Do you find it more relaxing playing without Eric picking it apart as much?
[37:22.750 --> 37:24.170]  That's funny you should mention that.
[37:24.690 --> 37:25.490]  Yes, I do.
[37:26.190 --> 37:27.250]  It's oddly quiet.
[37:27.530 --> 37:29.110]  How is Texas barbecue?
[37:29.690 --> 37:30.510]  I don't know.
[37:30.610 --> 37:32.050]  We're not really known for it.
[37:32.630 --> 37:33.030]  It's good.
[37:33.190 --> 37:33.410]  It's fine.
[37:33.530 --> 37:33.930]  It's whatever.
[37:35.010 --> 37:35.530]  I like it fine.
[37:35.970 --> 37:37.230]  It's fucking awesome, man.
[37:37.290 --> 37:38.210]  It's the only reason to live here.
[37:38.950 --> 37:41.450]  How long do you have to live in Texas to be a Texan?
[37:42.210 --> 37:44.650]  I don't think you can unless you...
[37:44.650 --> 37:45.730]  Gotta be born here?
[37:46.610 --> 37:47.150]  Well, I don't know.
[37:47.290 --> 37:47.830]  I guess it depends.
[37:47.950 --> 37:53.230]  You either become a Texan the day you have an address or you have to be born here.
[37:54.170 --> 37:55.930]  I guess it depends on how you look at it.
[37:56.690 --> 37:57.090]  Oh, balls.
[37:58.110 --> 37:59.290]  Run faster, damn it!
[38:00.690 --> 38:01.430]  Oh, you made it.
[38:02.010 --> 38:03.110]  I can't believe that worked.
[38:04.610 --> 38:08.030]  I don't think I've ever tried going past those people without killing every single one of them.
[38:09.770 --> 38:12.550]  Wow, that's how that's done.
[38:12.550 --> 38:14.130]  We can do Thai food.
[38:14.770 --> 38:15.850]  Ooh, Thai food's good.
[38:17.950 --> 38:20.310]  I need to be more adventurous with Thai.
[38:20.410 --> 38:21.290]  I keep getting pad Thai.
[38:24.050 --> 38:25.390]  I just defaulted.
[38:25.510 --> 38:26.790]  Ah, the fucking brush!
[38:28.270 --> 38:30.070]  You almost got killed by a bush.
[38:30.130 --> 38:30.570]  Oh, run!
[38:30.750 --> 38:30.890]  Run!
[38:33.790 --> 38:34.370]  Close the door!
[38:34.470 --> 38:34.790]  Close the door!
[38:34.890 --> 38:35.230]  Close the door!
[38:37.030 --> 38:38.230]  Not the soda!
[38:39.650 --> 38:40.910]  Not my sodies!
[38:42.590 --> 38:44.570]  Guy in Left 4 Dead 2 is going to be real mad about that.
[38:51.420 --> 38:51.920]  Oh, yeah.
[38:52.620 --> 38:55.740]  Nobody knows that Ellie's immune, so she has to wear a mask in front of everybody else.
[38:56.560 --> 38:56.920]  Disguise.
[38:57.280 --> 38:57.760]  A little trickery.
[38:58.540 --> 38:59.180]  A little trickery.
[38:59.680 --> 39:00.140]  In we go.
[39:03.790 --> 39:05.910]  Top five game that features crawling through a pipe.
[39:08.290 --> 39:10.890]  Are you asking for a list or are you just referring to this game?
[39:10.910 --> 39:11.670]  No, I'm just saying this is one.
[39:12.210 --> 39:13.130]  The Robear...
[39:13.770 --> 39:14.310]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[39:14.910 --> 39:16.650]  What's the best movie pipe scene?
[39:21.230 --> 39:23.950]  I don't feel like there's a lot of...
[39:23.950 --> 39:25.690]  Do air vents count as pipes?
[39:26.270 --> 39:27.210]  I would say vent counts.
[39:27.610 --> 39:29.690]  If a vent counts, that opens it up a lot.
[39:30.450 --> 39:32.090]  I immediately go to die hard.
[39:33.250 --> 39:34.290]  Complaining in the vents.
[39:34.850 --> 39:36.030]  Do crack pipes count?
[39:38.390 --> 39:39.510]  Is it Pulp Fiction?
[39:40.830 --> 39:41.790]  Yeah, I guess any pipe.
[39:42.670 --> 39:45.550]  Does the pipe in The Fugitive count?
[39:46.970 --> 39:49.070]  Yeah, I would think definitely, right?
[39:49.070 --> 39:50.130]  It's a big pipe.
[39:50.590 --> 39:51.610]  It's a big pipe.
[39:51.670 --> 39:53.090]  When does a pipe become a tunnel?
[39:55.990 --> 39:57.430]  I don't think it does.
[39:58.370 --> 39:59.710]  When it's purpose isn't for water.
[40:01.110 --> 40:03.990]  Like a people pipe is a tunnel?
[40:05.890 --> 40:06.330]  Yeah.
[40:07.750 --> 40:08.590]  Right? Yeah.
[40:11.050 --> 40:13.110]  Oh, I know how to get out of this bit.
[40:14.250 --> 40:16.110]  Remember how we unleashed the MILFs last week?
[40:20.040 --> 40:21.700]  Oh, that's dark.
[40:21.920 --> 40:22.320]  Here come the rest of them.
[40:25.940 --> 40:28.540]  Best comic book pipe was Jason Todd and the Joker.
[40:29.320 --> 40:29.480]  Dang.
[40:29.880 --> 40:30.600]  That's rough.
[40:30.680 --> 40:31.160]  That's dark.
[40:31.540 --> 40:32.340]  Really dark.
[40:32.800 --> 40:33.600]  You should probably see a therapist.
[40:36.080 --> 40:36.460]  I don't get it.
[40:37.260 --> 40:39.920]  Jason Todd was beaten to death by the Joker with a pipe.
[40:40.340 --> 40:42.920]  He was the second Robin, I believe, or the third?
[40:42.940 --> 40:43.880]  Allegedly beaten to death.
[40:44.660 --> 40:45.060]  Allegedly.
[40:47.760 --> 40:49.180]  Hilda decided maybe not to be.
[40:50.300 --> 40:54.620]  I like it in Aliens when Bishop gets welded into that pipe.
[40:58.420 --> 40:59.380]  Oh, shit.
[41:01.060 --> 41:03.080]  I saw Romulus the other day.
[41:03.900 --> 41:04.380]  What did you think?
[41:04.600 --> 41:06.940]  I really liked all the scenes that didn't have aliens.
[41:07.380 --> 41:09.360]  I was really impressed by all the set design.
[41:10.180 --> 41:11.240]  It's a really pretty movie.
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.780]  You didn't like the alien bit?
[41:13.100 --> 41:15.020]  I didn't find the alien stuff that interesting.
[41:16.220 --> 41:19.820]  But when they're navigating space, that was pretty cool.
[41:24.730 --> 41:27.730]  Maybe if I hide over here, that zombie won't follow us.
[41:28.990 --> 41:29.230]  Nope.
[41:31.510 --> 41:32.830]  I was locked in.
[41:33.750 --> 41:34.910]  Definitely followed you.
[41:35.350 --> 41:37.330]  It wasn't even the same one. It was a different one.
[41:37.350 --> 41:37.630]  Oh, really?
[41:38.210 --> 41:39.710]  Yeah, it was the second one.
[41:40.610 --> 41:41.810]  Yeah, it was Laugh Riot.
[41:42.610 --> 41:45.130]  Yes, I have seen Alien Romulus.
[41:45.130 --> 41:47.570]  I would rank it as the third best Alien film.
[41:49.010 --> 41:50.310]  Pretty low bar, though.
[41:50.410 --> 41:52.190]  What do you think the best Alien film is, Gavin?
[41:54.790 --> 41:56.250]  I think Aliens.
[41:56.790 --> 41:57.450]  I would agree.
[41:57.710 --> 41:58.190]  Yeah, I agree.
[41:58.730 --> 42:00.370]  Second best would be being Alien.
[42:00.810 --> 42:04.510]  I think Aliens is the scariest, though.
[42:05.050 --> 42:08.570]  Alien is the scariest, but Aliens is fun start to finish.
[42:08.750 --> 42:10.390]  Aliens is kind of a slow burn.
[42:11.470 --> 42:12.830]  It takes a minute to get going.
[42:12.830 --> 42:15.530]  As a kid, Aliens was pretty fucking scary.
[42:19.440 --> 42:24.020]  It's just that in the first Alien, it feels like an unkillable machine.
[42:24.660 --> 42:27.980]  And then in Aliens, they just melt like 50 of them instantly.
[42:27.980 --> 42:29.540]  Well, they don't have a gun in the first movie.
[42:30.000 --> 42:44.060]  I know, but they feel more intimidating. It's something about how physical and overbearing and just dominant it is that it seemed more intimidating in contrast to...
[42:44.060 --> 42:49.420]  I think Alien is considered a horror movie and Aliens is considered an action movie.
[42:49.440 --> 42:50.540]  Kind of like Terminator 2.
[42:51.460 --> 42:51.660]  Yeah.
[42:52.440 --> 42:53.280]  Oh, balls!
[42:55.300 --> 42:56.300]  Pinscher! Pinscher!
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.260]  Zombie got you there.
[43:00.920 --> 43:04.040]  Someone asked if Alien and Aliens are the best duo movies in a series.
[43:04.320 --> 43:06.760]  I would argue that Terminator 1 and 2 also.
[43:06.920 --> 43:08.180]  Godfather, Godfather 2.
[43:09.020 --> 43:09.260]  Oh, yeah.
[43:10.020 --> 43:11.200]  Grownups, Grownups 2.
[43:12.300 --> 43:13.300]  Predator, Predator 2.
[43:16.800 --> 43:18.760]  I liked Predator 2. I liked Danny Glover.
[43:18.860 --> 43:19.540]  I liked it too.
[43:20.620 --> 43:21.760]  City Predator was a cool idea.
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.020]  City Predator was cool. You know they did a bunch of novels in the Predator universe?
[43:26.420 --> 43:31.160]  I did not know that, but I liked the sound of that. Have you read them?
[43:32.140 --> 43:38.860]  Yes, I read a few of them. They're written from the perspective of Dutch's brother, who is a cop in, I think, New York.
[43:39.600 --> 43:46.740]  And so, he teams up with some cops who are fired from the force, and then a bunch of criminals to help fight them.
[43:46.820 --> 43:50.100]  Because there's a group of predators hunting people in New York City or something.
[43:50.380 --> 43:53.920]  And so he teams up with a bunch of bad guys to take them on, because the cops won't do shit.
[43:55.320 --> 43:57.080]  Our Predator video should come out soon, shouldn't it?
[43:58.060 --> 43:58.860]  At some point.
[43:59.400 --> 44:00.660]  We have so many other things.
[44:01.120 --> 44:02.860]  It's not on the schedule currently, but yeah.
[44:03.740 --> 44:04.520]  It's a good video.
[44:05.020 --> 44:05.400]  It is.
[44:08.760 --> 44:09.800]  I want to play that again.
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.220]  I'm excited to hear what was said when I was the Predator.
[44:16.200 --> 44:19.340]  Somebody said Bad Boys 1 and 2. Oh, Paddington 1 and 2. That's a good one.
[44:19.560 --> 44:20.700]  Oh, that's a great one.
[44:22.020 --> 44:23.320]  Rush Hour 1 and 2.
[44:24.140 --> 44:24.940]  Fast 5 and 6.
[44:24.940 --> 44:25.660]  28 Days and Weeks Later.
[44:27.560 --> 44:29.300]  The Mummy. The Mummy Returns.
[44:29.500 --> 44:31.360]  MVP. MVP 2. Those are good ones.
[44:31.880 --> 44:32.760]  Oh, fantastic.
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.500]  Changing of Genre.
[44:36.900 --> 44:37.280]  Hey, that works.
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.960]  Star Wars 5 and 6. Absolutely.
[44:39.960 --> 44:40.920]  Alien and Aliens did.
[44:40.980 --> 44:45.960]  As far as I'm concerned, Star Wars 5 and 6 could be the only ones in the fucking whole universe.
[44:46.500 --> 44:48.620]  Was Star Wars 5 the first numbered one?
[44:51.220 --> 44:51.540]  4.
[44:54.060 --> 44:54.380]  What?
[44:55.120 --> 44:57.980]  But it didn't come out as 4. They did that retroactively.
[44:58.560 --> 44:59.380]  I guess it did, yeah.
[44:59.500 --> 45:02.040]  It was just called Star Wars A New Hope.
[45:04.060 --> 45:04.540]  Oh, was it?
[45:06.720 --> 45:07.460]  Yeah, I think so.
[45:07.460 --> 45:09.160]  I think it was just called Star Wars initially.
[45:09.500 --> 45:11.540]  I remember it being Chapter 4 when I was a kid.
[45:11.820 --> 45:13.400]  They came out of the gate with 4? That's crazy.
[45:14.680 --> 45:17.960]  Somebody said it was retroactively made Episode 4, so maybe I'm remembering wrong.
[45:19.200 --> 45:21.580]  So it was still called New Hope, but it wasn't just called Star Wars?
[45:22.820 --> 45:24.320]  I think it was called A New Hope.
[45:26.680 --> 45:29.040]  Oh, it wasn't even called A New Hope then, just Star Wars. There you go.
[45:29.200 --> 45:30.240]  Yeah, it was just Star Wars, I think.
[45:30.600 --> 45:36.620]  I think it's also weird that Indiana Jones is... the first one is just called Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[45:38.320 --> 45:41.240]  That's the other thing you lose when you get old memory of Star Wars numbering system.
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.820]  That's true, man. Everything... the past just all compresses into one memory at some point.
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.840]  In your defense, they changed the past for that. Like what those movies are known as now.
[45:53.020 --> 45:57.680]  They've changed it so many times in my lifetime too, it's hard to keep up, it feels like.
[46:01.620 --> 46:02.760]  That was cool lighting.
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.220]  Oh, I can't do it. Oh, that's bad.
[46:05.360 --> 46:06.320]  I guess you're still in that scene.
[46:10.460 --> 46:11.440]  That was a good shot, eh?
[46:12.660 --> 46:13.740]  Now that was a good shot.
[46:14.460 --> 46:15.640]  Can I open it now? Why?
[46:17.460 --> 46:18.940]  Oh, please kill it, Dina.
[46:20.100 --> 46:21.400]  I don't want to waste another bullet.
[46:22.440 --> 46:25.260]  You have so many guns, you should use them to kill the zombie.
[46:25.280 --> 46:26.840]  I know, but I don't want to use it.
[46:26.900 --> 46:27.900]  It's going to kill you.
[46:28.220 --> 46:28.840]  Oh, it sure is!
[46:29.700 --> 46:30.060]  No!
[46:31.640 --> 46:34.780]  I thought I had reloaded!
[46:35.520 --> 46:37.100]  Did you just click at his face?
[46:37.940 --> 46:39.000]  Yeah, it just...
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.220]  You clicked against the clicker?
[46:40.220 --> 46:43.240]  I clicked against the clicker.
[46:43.320 --> 46:44.260]  Oh, and all the way back here.
[46:44.520 --> 46:46.500]  Oh, I hit the guy with the brick!
[46:46.860 --> 46:51.760]  That was fucking awesome, dude.
[46:51.840 --> 46:53.740]  And now he's going to die for it!
[47:00.240 --> 47:01.940]  At least this bit's fun.
[47:06.220 --> 47:06.720]  Wow.
[47:08.700 --> 47:10.400]  Just them running around screaming.
[47:11.020 --> 47:12.440]  Oh, look! Look at this guy!
[47:12.640 --> 47:13.220]  Look at that guy!
[47:13.300 --> 47:15.040]  Oh, man!
[47:17.140 --> 47:19.680]  Who do you hope wins? Who's easier to fight?
[47:22.400 --> 47:24.740]  Probably the clickers.
[47:26.660 --> 47:28.320]  Oh my god, Jessica!
[47:28.820 --> 47:30.440]  You got your wish, do something.
[47:32.960 --> 47:33.360]  Damn it.
[47:33.480 --> 47:36.340]  I have had a spit take two times today, and I almost had a third one.
[47:37.320 --> 47:38.760]  Oh yeah, you had one on the podcast.
[47:39.320 --> 47:40.320]  On the podcast, yeah.
[47:41.320 --> 47:42.800]  On the Let's Play, and then the podcast.
[47:44.580 --> 47:47.840]  You didn't hear it on the podcast, because you all were in the middle of something, and I was just like...
[47:47.840 --> 47:49.240]  What did you laugh at on the podcast?
[47:49.480 --> 47:51.000]  I don't remember now.
[47:53.240 --> 47:55.720]  I have a feeling it was something to do with the...
[47:56.320 --> 47:57.440]  Oh, maybe a weasel.
[48:02.980 --> 48:04.700]  Might have created some new lore today.
[48:06.740 --> 48:07.840]  Flags and weasels.
[48:12.580 --> 48:14.360]  Oh, god. It was really fun.
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.980]  It's weird being back to only having one recorded.
[48:17.980 --> 48:18.960]  It is weird.
[48:19.080 --> 48:19.860]  Feels a little dangerous.
[48:20.460 --> 48:21.540]  Oh, fuck!
[48:21.800 --> 48:22.520]  Oh, shit!
[48:22.760 --> 48:23.740]  Making it dangerous.
[48:24.680 --> 48:26.700]  You gotta get a bulletproof mask.
[48:27.440 --> 48:28.020]  Yeah, really?
[48:28.560 --> 48:29.460]  I'm good at these things.
[48:30.580 --> 48:33.280]  Did they sell that? Like a goalie mask for bullets?
[48:35.020 --> 48:36.640]  A Kevlar mask?
[48:37.840 --> 48:39.180]  Yeah, I think it's called a helm.
[48:40.160 --> 48:41.060]  A sleep mask?
[48:41.560 --> 48:42.740]  Kevlar sleep mask?
[48:42.880 --> 48:43.380]  Gonna go over the road this time.
[48:44.260 --> 48:45.300]  Don't notice me.
[48:45.860 --> 48:46.760]  Keep going that way.
[48:46.840 --> 48:47.760]  There you go.
[48:48.460 --> 48:49.600]  And I'm gonna go over here.
[48:53.320 --> 48:54.680]  What? How did you see me?
[48:56.640 --> 48:57.780]  It's red in here.
[48:59.300 --> 48:59.940]  Oh, look.
[49:00.360 --> 49:02.480]  Oh, shit!
[49:07.960 --> 49:08.760]  Oh, shit!
[49:08.760 --> 49:09.580]  That distracted me.
[49:12.780 --> 49:14.480]  I got no interest in you.
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.420]  Is the Benny Hills theme playing in anyone else's head right now?
[49:22.500 --> 49:23.620]  That was awesome.
[49:24.800 --> 49:26.960]  Alright, this is how I died last time, so I should pay attention to the door.
[49:26.980 --> 49:28.620]  Did you do, like, the wrong song?
[49:29.400 --> 49:29.660]  What?
[49:30.300 --> 49:30.820]  No, Benny Hill.
[49:30.820 --> 49:31.540]  Okay.
[49:32.420 --> 49:32.820]  Right?
[49:33.360 --> 49:33.700]  Is that wrong?
[49:34.840 --> 49:36.440]  Go ahead, Nick. Do the Benny Hill.
[49:37.020 --> 49:39.020]  What is the song you think Glory is?
[49:39.740 --> 49:41.900]  No, I didn't think it. I just sang it wrong.
[49:42.880 --> 49:43.680]  That was fate.
[49:47.380 --> 49:47.780]  Wow.
[49:51.860 --> 49:52.900]  Oh, yeah. You know what?
[49:53.100 --> 49:53.820]  I started it wrong.
[49:54.200 --> 49:55.280]  And it's throwing me off.
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.280]  The Benny Hill theme, that is.
[49:58.380 --> 49:59.400]  The Carnival song?
[49:59.400 --> 50:00.820]  Yeah, it's like the Carnival...
[50:00.820 --> 50:04.040]  That is not what I was doing.
[50:04.100 --> 50:04.460]  Oh, okay.
[50:06.160 --> 50:06.580]  No!
[50:06.760 --> 50:07.590]  No, what I was doing was...
[50:10.880 --> 50:14.560]  It's like Vanilla Ice explaining the difference between Ice Ice Baby and Under Pressure.
[50:14.560 --> 50:20.240]  This is a supplemental content where we have Nick hum and da-da-da-da-da songs.
[50:22.100 --> 50:24.160]  I don't look forward to that at all.
[50:25.340 --> 50:28.520]  It's just me panicking in the moment and getting it wrong.
[50:29.920 --> 50:32.920]  Everything is Duel of the Fates, and then when we ask him to do that, he gets it wrong.
[50:35.680 --> 50:36.420]  Get it, Clicker!
[50:38.720 --> 50:39.460]  Oh, For Bull!
[50:40.260 --> 50:42.560]  Dude, you gotta watch 6, man.
[50:43.500 --> 50:44.080]  For Bull.
[50:46.860 --> 50:48.420]  Did I say For Bull?
[50:51.240 --> 50:52.520]  Well, that's what y'all call it. Football.
[50:53.600 --> 50:54.360]  Oh, For Bull!
[50:55.940 --> 50:58.600]  Favorite of the Halloween franchise. First one, I guess.
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.900]  Yeah, probably the first one.
[51:00.960 --> 51:01.520]  Second one's good.
[51:02.860 --> 51:06.900]  The third one would have been fine if it wasn't a Halloween movie.
[51:07.460 --> 51:08.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[51:08.600 --> 51:11.880]  It was a good concept, just weird to put in that franchise.
[51:14.440 --> 51:15.580]  It's a weird series.
[51:16.940 --> 51:19.160]  They go to some strange places with Michael Myers.
[51:20.900 --> 51:23.160]  The first one being when they break him out of jail.
[51:24.020 --> 51:26.160]  When that happened, I was like, what am I watching?
[51:27.180 --> 51:28.100]  Why do they do that?
[51:29.180 --> 51:32.980]  To harness his evil powers, it's the end of one of the films.
[51:33.700 --> 51:38.820]  A not-previously-introduced villain blows him out of prison.
[51:40.280 --> 51:44.280]  Which is something that happens in Friday the 13th a couple of times, I think.
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.880]  Is Halloween a supernatural franchise?
[51:47.760 --> 51:51.000]  Yeah, it's like all of them where it shifts.
[51:52.040 --> 51:53.300]  Well, it depends on which...
[51:53.300 --> 51:55.660]  It isn't until they decide it is.
[51:55.660 --> 51:58.660]  I've seen the first one, but that's just a guy, right?
[51:59.760 --> 52:01.640]  Yes, in the first one, yes, he's just a guy.
[52:01.940 --> 52:05.100]  For there to be a second one, it has to shift.
[52:06.840 --> 52:07.240]  Okay.
[52:07.640 --> 52:08.700]  And then it just keeps going.
[52:10.480 --> 52:12.200]  That's how Jason ends up in space.
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.580]  But in the new trilogy that they did, where they picked up after the original,
[52:19.780 --> 52:20.880]  and they just undid all the canon,
[52:21.920 --> 52:26.620]  is he more mythological-type monster creature?
[52:26.780 --> 52:28.480]  Or is he just a dude who's like...
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.420]  Yeah, he's like a mythological representation of evil.
[52:34.120 --> 52:36.260]  I've only seen the first one of those.
[52:36.400 --> 52:40.620]  The one with... I don't know what it was called.
[52:41.080 --> 52:44.180]  But the one that came out maybe three years ago, the very first remake.
[52:44.240 --> 52:45.280]  I think it's just called Halloween.
[52:45.600 --> 52:47.300]  Halloween, yeah. That was pretty good.
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.460]  There's been two more since that, right? Or just one more?
[52:49.460 --> 52:53.460]  I like all of them with the second being the weakest.
[52:54.480 --> 52:55.760]  People hate the third.
[52:56.320 --> 52:57.580]  I'll have to check them out. But you liked it?
[52:58.020 --> 52:58.860]  I liked it, yeah.
[52:59.440 --> 53:02.620]  And it just picks up where that first Halloween one took off?
[53:02.840 --> 53:05.040]  Yeah, they all are pretty linear.
[53:07.680 --> 53:08.360]  JokerMan5656 says,
[53:08.440 --> 53:10.680]  Gavin, I doubt you remember, but I've been searching for Minecraft
[53:10.680 --> 53:13.900]  where you did the indie song and then said Star Wars.
[53:14.200 --> 53:15.340]  Do you remember when that was?
[53:15.400 --> 53:17.060]  You are correct. I do not remember.
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.780]  Alright, this is the run.
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.560]  Do you remember what your secret word was that you made?
[53:29.980 --> 53:32.480]  For me? Whatever the word you made up?
[53:32.960 --> 53:34.420]  Ah, shit. I still don't remember that.
[53:34.480 --> 53:35.260]  It's gone?
[53:35.660 --> 53:37.460]  Oh, bollocks, son of a...
[53:38.480 --> 53:41.920]  Oh, that's bad.
[53:44.220 --> 53:46.740]  Oh, you almost dodged that.
[53:47.300 --> 53:48.060]  That was close.
[53:49.260 --> 53:50.660]  I appreciate the help.
[53:52.620 --> 53:58.540]  Yeah, my memory of what happened in what year since I moved here is just disgraceful.
[54:00.380 --> 54:01.680]  So much I don't remember.
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.460]  It just gets worse.
[54:05.940 --> 54:10.080]  The radio show I listen to talks about show amnesia.
[54:10.240 --> 54:11.280]  And I think that's just true.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.060]  If you're in a lot of productions of something, you just kind of forget.
[54:15.500 --> 54:19.860]  Yeah, it's like people have been pointing out that we had previously talked about 50 Cent
[54:19.860 --> 54:23.060]  comparing getting shot in the face to Reed Canals in the past.
[54:23.180 --> 54:25.640]  Like, I don't know, three years ago, two years ago.
[54:26.880 --> 54:29.120]  We talk about so much stuff.
[54:29.500 --> 54:32.400]  So, Regulations is not even the only podcast, you know.
[54:33.480 --> 54:37.740]  Gavin still has his slow-mo guys, and Nick and Eric have their other stuff.
[54:37.900 --> 54:38.780]  And I have got Anma.
[54:40.380 --> 54:45.320]  So all right, it's just like you talk about so much shit, you can't even come close to remembering.
[54:45.660 --> 54:47.140]  I can't remember what I talked about yesterday.
[54:49.910 --> 54:52.090]  Oh yeah, it's also hard to differentiate, too.
[54:52.550 --> 54:53.810]  Where you talked about it?
[54:54.070 --> 54:54.790]  Yeah, exactly.
[54:56.670 --> 55:00.470]  So oftentimes when somebody brings something up that sounds vaguely familiar,
[55:00.750 --> 55:03.150]  if you're trying to be entertaining instead of going,
[55:03.390 --> 55:09.210]  wait a minute, let's derail the conversation to have an awkward three-minute conversation
[55:09.210 --> 55:11.690]  about whether this is something that we've discussed or not.
[55:12.030 --> 55:17.490]  Sometimes you just roll with it because you feel like it'll make a cleaner piece of content.
[55:19.970 --> 55:25.510]  I wonder if I could just slowly walk past all of them and go out that door.
[55:25.750 --> 55:27.790]  Go for it. Although I didn't let you open it.
[55:28.570 --> 55:29.730]  Fuck. I didn't reload.
[55:31.270 --> 55:33.590]  Oh, you know what? I distracted them long enough.
[55:34.410 --> 55:34.930]  No witnesses.
[55:35.730 --> 55:38.090]  No witnesses. Oh, Dina's engaged.
[55:41.830 --> 55:45.370]  Dina. Dina. If you're gonna do it, kill him. Kill him, Dina.
[55:46.130 --> 55:46.430]  All right.
[55:46.430 --> 55:49.310]  What? Oh, no.
[55:51.490 --> 55:53.050]  That clicker said no.
[55:53.730 --> 55:57.550]  Listen, Nick, I'm totally down with going past 5-0-1. I don't care.
[55:57.710 --> 56:00.050]  But at 6, the Celtics game starts.
[56:01.830 --> 56:03.010]  Is this still preseason?
[56:03.230 --> 56:04.910]  No. This is game two.
[56:05.830 --> 56:08.970]  Oh. And also at 6 o'clock, Mavs Spurs start.
[56:09.230 --> 56:11.370]  Your fucking first game of the year for the Spurs.
[56:11.930 --> 56:13.250]  Is it nationally televised?
[56:13.610 --> 56:14.270]  It's on TNT.
[56:16.570 --> 56:18.650]  It's the first nationally televised game tonight.
[56:19.050 --> 56:23.150]  Based on the first couple games, I'm going to determine whether or not I'm getting Valley Sports to watch it all season.
[56:23.150 --> 56:23.510]  There you go.
[56:24.770 --> 56:30.350]  I got it briefly last year so I could watch just one month of Wimby games. I kind of got my fill and then I canceled it.
[56:31.650 --> 56:33.730]  Are we all getting back on at 9 tonight for some Cod?
[56:34.970 --> 56:35.470]  I'll be on.
[56:37.190 --> 56:37.590]  What?
[56:38.270 --> 56:38.610]  What?
[56:39.610 --> 56:40.510]  Doesn't it come out tonight?
[56:41.110 --> 56:41.970]  It does come out tonight.
[56:42.410 --> 56:45.610]  But I think it's 11 for you.
[56:47.270 --> 56:54.410]  Stratman 67 says he's going to see Wimby finally. I saw him last year when they did the Austin game. It was fucking wild.
[56:54.610 --> 56:59.330]  We had floor seats almost. He was giant. I got some photos of him. Insane.
[56:59.330 --> 57:02.130]  Dude, that dude is huge. It's nuts.
[57:02.330 --> 57:05.310]  I got a picture of Joker staring at me while I took a picture of him. Pretty cool.
[57:08.110 --> 57:13.770]  I was looking at the Microsoft Store earlier and they have an Alien 2 movie collection of Alien and Alien Romulus.
[57:13.770 --> 57:17.730]  Imagine those being the only two Alien movies you've seen.
[57:18.230 --> 57:20.210]  Well, one is a direct sequel to the other, right?
[57:20.790 --> 57:22.130]  Well, it's a prequel, isn't it?
[57:22.930 --> 57:26.770]  No. Romulus? Romulus is after...
[57:28.010 --> 57:28.650]  Is it?
[57:28.650 --> 57:29.870]  It's like 20 years after Alien.
[57:30.470 --> 57:31.950]  But before Aliens?
[57:32.470 --> 57:34.830]  That timeline is so fucking confusing.
[57:35.470 --> 57:37.090]  Aliens is like...
[57:37.090 --> 57:37.950]  50 years later.
[57:38.690 --> 57:40.690]  What's the first movie in the franchise?
[57:41.330 --> 57:41.890]  Prometheus.
[57:41.890 --> 57:42.650]  Oh, holy shit.
[57:42.830 --> 57:44.990]  And what's the last movie in the franchise?
[57:46.590 --> 57:49.010]  I don't even know how to count it.
[57:49.690 --> 57:50.970]  Like Alien 4?
[57:51.290 --> 57:55.070]  I assume it'd be Resurrection because that was like two centuries after Alien or something.
[57:56.370 --> 57:59.150]  Wow, we bypassed both those areas without a huge problem.
[57:59.150 --> 58:00.390]  That was amazing.
[58:01.030 --> 58:01.910]  How about that?
[58:02.910 --> 58:05.750]  Well, wasn't the Alien in Romulus the Alien from Alien?
[58:07.310 --> 58:09.150]  Oh, I think it was supposed to be.
[58:09.590 --> 58:09.990]  Was it?
[58:12.290 --> 58:12.770]  Yeah.
[58:14.590 --> 58:17.730]  Somebody said Aliens vs. Predator would be first in the franchise.
[58:18.630 --> 58:20.170]  I didn't count that.
[58:20.870 --> 58:21.710]  I think you have to, Gavin.
[58:22.130 --> 58:22.550]  Does it?
[58:23.750 --> 58:28.210]  Because the Prometheus movie is about the creation of the Xenomorph.
[58:29.010 --> 58:30.030]  Oh, there you go.
[58:30.230 --> 58:31.970]  I haven't seen half of these movies.
[58:33.070 --> 58:34.510]  I'm just enjoying listening to you guys arguing.
[58:35.750 --> 58:40.010]  Well, Prometheus was like the introductory to what the Xenomorph would become.
[58:40.110 --> 58:41.090]  That thing wasn't a Xenomorph.
[58:41.890 --> 58:42.570]  It was like a pre...
[58:42.570 --> 58:44.150]  Pre-Xen.
[58:45.870 --> 58:47.590]  Somebody said Prey is first.
[58:48.630 --> 58:49.550]  The fuck is that?
[58:50.190 --> 58:52.210]  Oh, the Predator movie.
[58:52.690 --> 58:54.650]  Oh, yeah, the fucking...
[58:54.650 --> 58:55.090]  Oh!
[58:55.690 --> 58:56.750]  I haven't seen that yet.
[58:57.430 --> 58:58.030]  What?
[58:59.430 --> 59:03.690]  I'm just connecting the Alien and the Xenomorph in space is the original Alien.
[59:03.930 --> 59:04.570]  Got it!
[59:04.950 --> 59:06.370]  They say that in the movie.
[59:07.030 --> 59:09.190]  Well, I just didn't...
[59:09.190 --> 59:12.210]  Also, why would they have to...
[59:12.890 --> 59:13.850]  The whole...
[59:13.850 --> 59:16.230]  I can't say without spoiling it.
[59:16.490 --> 59:16.950]  Okay.
[59:17.730 --> 59:19.390]  The cut in half guy.
[59:20.130 --> 59:21.410]  The cut in half guy.
[59:22.750 --> 59:22.990]  Yep.
[59:23.390 --> 59:26.370]  That would have to be after, otherwise everyone would have known that he was a...
[59:27.150 --> 59:27.690]  Oh, right.
[59:27.770 --> 59:30.410]  Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:31.070 --> 59:34.470]  It still makes no sense that they would use that model again.
[59:35.090 --> 59:36.430]  If it was an undercover human.
[59:41.220 --> 59:43.620]  Yeah, you know what? I didn't...
[59:43.620 --> 59:45.140]  I haven't seen the original in a long time.
[59:45.740 --> 59:49.260]  I honestly forgot that there was an undercover human in the first film.
[59:50.520 --> 59:51.380]  Bilbo Baggins.
[59:53.140 --> 59:53.660]  Oh!
[59:55.080 --> 59:56.420]  Bilbo Baggins is a human?
[59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.000]  No, he's a hobbit, but...
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.160]  Oh, shit! Really?
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.780]  No wonder he made all those journeys.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.160]  I had never made that connection and I'm so pissed at myself right now.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.100]  The ashes Bilbo?
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.400]  Somebody said, Nick, save!
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.000]  You know what?
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.560]  Thank you, GDuff91.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.280]  Thank you.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.860]  I would say they were his best roles.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.460]  Oh shit, it's 501!
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.500]  Oh, 501!
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.920]  That's everybody's best time of day.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.580]  We should make a shirt that says 501.
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.520]  Can you open this?
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.400]  Oh, I can't.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:40.860]  Is this the next area?
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.260]  Is his name Ian Holm?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.820]  Yeah, and he was in Fifth Element.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120]  Oh, yeah. He's the priest, right?
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.600]  Bless you.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:59.220]  I was trying to mute. I was trying to fight through my eyes to hit the mute button and I couldn't see it.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.260]  So I just sneezed right into the headset.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.720]  What do you think? Should we keep going or should we call it here?
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.040]  Yeah, sure.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.140]  Go for a minute.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.220]  Etch the serial number back on.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.760]  Yeah, 58 minutes until Wimby takes the court.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:18.980]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.620]  Oh, Brazil. I don't remember him in Brazil.
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:23.840]  Oh, he's in Ratatouille.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.760]  That guy's got a lot of good work.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.000]  Accuracy. Stability. Accuracy.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.900]  I never played the alien isolation game.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.100]  I played a little bit of it and I got too scared.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:36.580]  Same.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.300]  I never got to the alien.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.000]  Yeah, those androids were annoying in that game.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:50.080]  I think I played the DLC from the original movie they added and I just kept dying instantly.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.900]  That reminds me of an idea I wanted to pitch you guys for a little while that I actually got from Emily.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:00.760]  We could play Never Have I Ever, but video game edition.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.680]  Because I was thinking the other day, I've never played Grand Theft Auto 1.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:06.820]  Haven't you?
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.300]  No, I don't think so.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.760]  Oh, it was so good.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.520]  I don't think I ever played it. I think I played two, but I don't think I ever played one.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.600]  And I was thinking about all the things you think you should have done in gaming that you just haven't done.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.920]  Like Bernie and Antonio have never played Halo. It's insane to me.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.640]  I thought you were going to say a Never Have I Ever, but like an act.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.020]  Like I've never blown a dude's dick off and then you'd name the game you did it in.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.100]  Oh, no, we could do that too.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.440]  That's an interesting idea.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.920]  There's a bunch of games that seem like you should have played in your life, but you haven't.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.620]  Like Andrew never played Alien Isolation.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:45.580]  I've never played or seen a single frame of any Final Fantasy game. I have no idea what those games are.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.460]  So there's the episode of Gavin is we sit you down and you play Final Fantasy 7 or something.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.880]  Not for the 40 hours, but for just one video.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.280]  No. Which one though?
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:58.640]  7?
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:00.560]  The remake?
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:01.860]  Probably, yeah.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.180]  I don't know.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.840]  You're not the one to ask. You don't know shit about the game.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.100]  Oh yeah, shit's popping off in here.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:24.820]  Yeah, this is the introduction of the... especially the boomers in this world.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.820]  Oh yeah, play until you fight the boomer.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.540]  Play until I fight the boomer.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.520]  Alright, let's do this. This might be it right here.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.820]  I've still never played a Witcher game and apparently they're good.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.420]  Oh, the third one's incredible. I played it for like an hour and turned it off.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.840]  People get really bogged down until you reach a certain stage.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.120]  I just can't reach that stage. I've tried three times. I kill the griffon and then I turn it off.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.880]  Oh shit.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.440]  Is that the boomer?
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.180]  Your skin fell off.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.260]  Oh, alright. Well, I'm going to try to not engage the boomer this time.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.160]  Hey, GlassesMcDorkface, glad you caught us. Welcome to the... whatever the fuck this is.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.700]  Have you streamed recently, Geoff?
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.400]  No, I haven't streamed since before all the summer travel started.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.180]  I'd like to get back to it. I've just been so busy lately.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.660]  Does he know I'm here?
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:27.280]  I think he might.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.160]  Hit him with a brick.
[01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:32.490]  Go that way. Go that way.
[01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:35.590]  I don't think so.
[01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:37.510]  Looks like he's got a scarf made of eyes.
[01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:40.150]  He looks like he needs to see Dr. Pimple Popper.
[01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:47.570]  Man, they're pissed. Alright.
[01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.170]  What the hell were we just talking about?
[01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:57.130]  Shit.
[01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:02.930]  What did you think Andrew and Romulus when she killed all the aliens in Zero-G?
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.860]  What was one takeaway from that scene that I thought was bullshit?
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:14.900]  The...
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:19.800]  The fear of alien blood I thought was interesting.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:23.100]  I don't think any of the other movies have discussed that.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.180]  The first one.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.160]  Does it?
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.160]  Like I just slapped the shit out of you to death.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.720]  I don't think any of the other movies did it. The first one.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.360]  I clearly did not remember the first one very well.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.840]  The face hugger drips like a tiny drip of blood and it melts through like three decks of the ship.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:47.880]  Oh yeah, but it's not... there's never like a conversation of we can't kill this thing because it's gonna melt our ship.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.540]  I thought that was interesting. Yeah, that's exactly what they talked about.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.600]  In the first movie? Yeah.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.600]  Then what's Dallas doing in Ketz?
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.580]  What was his goal?
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.520]  They were trying to cook it with a flamethrower.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.640]  I feel like you're gonna get blood.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.320]  He was trying to get it to go into an airlock or something.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.260]  I feel like they make an effort to kill that thing and it doesn't make sense, what you're saying.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.940]  I thought he was trying to like flesh it out or something.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.800]  Yeah, and in the second one they... one of the guys gets melted by alien blood.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:24.320]  Yeah, they establish its toxicity. I just had never considered the impact of like I can't kill this thing even if I...
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.540]  I don't even know what happened to you there. Did the boomer get you?
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.900]  Yeah, the boomer got me.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:37.140]  My bullshit takeaway from that scene was where all the freaking aliens go? Where the bodies go?
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:38.700]  I didn't... yeah.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.260]  Just a bunch of blood.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:49.040]  How did that one alien... did it turn into a queen and make more aliens? How the hell did it get more aliens then?
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:51.520]  In that sequence.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.640]  Did they make them?
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.880]  I mean they make...
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.080]  They manufactured them, right? And that's...
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.640]  Oh, is it a spoiler?
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.600]  Well, it's in the beginning of the... once the aliens show up.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:13.240]  I would love to see a box office total in an alternate universe if that movie was called Alien Remus.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:27.180]  Maybe I'll watch all the alien franchise movies in the canonical order.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.000]  I mean, watching one, then three, then two would be a pretty cool experience, I think.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.940]  I've seen one, two, and three.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.760]  I mean, one, then, uh, one, then Romulus, then two.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:39.400]  Yeah.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:44.280]  Got to move, got to move, got to move, got to move, got to move, got to move, got to move, got to move, this is it.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.160]  Oh balls.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:45.580]  Go!
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.220]  Oh, you're stuck?
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:47.660]  Hold on.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:48.920]  Yeah, it's a dead end.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.300]  It's a dead end.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.600]  I picked... I chose poorly.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.920]  To quote Indiana Jones.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:06.920]  The Xenos exist before Prometheus in the new Hulu show. Is there a Hulu alien show as well?
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.680]  What? It's coming out. It's not out yet.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.260]  Christ, I can't catch up. Please chill out.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.260]  Don't Star Wars my aliens.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.840]  I mean, they kind of did that. They're owned by Disney.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.740]  Don't look at me. Don't look at me.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.300]  Can you stuff a bomb up its ass?
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.620]  I don't know.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.660]  Can you reason with it?
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.220]  Did they do that in Alien 1?
[01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.090]  Andrew, it sounds like you need to watch Alien 1.
[01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:38.770]  I should re-watch it.
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:43.690]  I think I was too scared to comprehend the plot points that were part of the film.
[01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:46.870]  Sorry, I killed it.
[01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.390]  It's pissed.
[01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.430]  It's dead. That one's dead.
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.950]  It's dead.
[01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.510]  My friend. My friend is dead.
[01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:01.150]  Oh, it's all a dead end.
[01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:04.130]  Oh, it's one of these bits where we have to fight them, basically.
[01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:07.470]  What franchise crossover with aliens would be fun? Rush Hour?
[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.990]  Heely?
[01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:10.210]  Batman?
[01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:12.390]  Paddington?
[01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.030]  Paddington in the Xenomorph?
[01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:17.350]  No, I don't want to put Paddington in that risk.
[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.810]  Why?
[01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.290]  He's too sweet.
[01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.110]  It's still alive?
[01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:23.770]  I think it went.
[01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.490]  No!
[01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:25.690]  No!
[01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.490]  You were so close.
[01:09:32.730 --> 01:09:34.590]  Maybe I can get him with a bomb this time.
[01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:37.010]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:39.390]  Reload everything?
[01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:42.030]  Yeah, that's a good start.
[01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:44.390]  There you go.
[01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.310]  Oh, the little guy's going to blow it up.
[01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:50.490]  Oh!
[01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:52.630]  Oh!
[01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:55.170]  Whoa!
[01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:56.210]  Holy shit!
[01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.170]  Wow!
[01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:02.450]  That was proper horror movie shit.
[01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:04.610]  That worked out.
[01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:07.790]  He's a shambler.
[01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:09.750]  A shambler.
[01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:10.790]  Can't be stealth killed.
[01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.490]  Yeah.
[01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:15.190]  That checks out.
[01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:17.290]  That's for you.
[01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:18.830]  Hey, bud.
[01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:21.110]  It blew up.
[01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:22.110]  Did it kill him?
[01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.870]  God, no.
[01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:26.130]  I bet he can't hear anymore.
[01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:26.750]  Oh, that killed him.
[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.950]  Oh, shit!
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:30.370]  How?
[01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.270]  Also, Nick, that was your best rifle shot yet.
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:36.690]  Oh, thank you.
[01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.110]  Oops.
[01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:41.250]  I was so worried that he hadn't reloaded.
[01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:42.590]  Oh, balls.
[01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:45.650]  That infected just Mr. President in that shambler.
[01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.590]  Loopy loop.
[01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:51.190]  No, I don't want to waste it on this guy.
[01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:52.310]  But I will.
[01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:56.670]  Damn, Nick. Ballsy move, man.
[01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:00.650]  If I can hit the other guy
[01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:01.990]  with this.
[01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:03.030]  Slow him down.
[01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.290]  Oh, shoot him in the dick.
[01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.410]  Got him.
[01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:08.450]  Nice.
[01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:10.170]  Oh, there's another one.
[01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:11.490]  Oh, no, it's just a zombie.
[01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.890]  Kill it.
[01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.850]  Oh, she got it.
[01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.470]  Nice.
[01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.730]  You do it.
[01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:21.750]  I think we did it.
[01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:22.810]  That's a good stopping point.
[01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.210]  That was awesome.
[01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.110]  You're looking real good in this game, Nick.
[01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:28.010]  See, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.030]  We can't stop now.
[01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:33.590]  We gotta keep the streaming going.
[01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:35.370]  Hell yeah.
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:36.450]  We gotta finish the story.
[01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:37.550]  Save.
[01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:40.890]  We're not messing around with that.
[01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:42.450]  Well, thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:44.470]  This will be the last one for the month of October.
[01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:47.270]  But, like Geoff said, we can't just let this go stale.
[01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:49.270]  So we'll come back to this at some point,
[01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:50.610]  stream it a little bit more,
[01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:52.950]  and then also release it on our YouTube channel.
[01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.810]  20 bucks says you'd never stream it again.
[01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.910]  I'll take that bet.
[01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.830]  I'll take that bet that he does it
[01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:59.590]  before the end of the year.
[01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.590]  I'll take that bet.
[01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:03.090]  So...
[01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.650]  Wait, am I paying everyone?
[01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:05.470]  I guess.
[01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.310]  I'm putting 20 in the pot.
[01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.150]  That's not how this works, man.
[01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.390]  It's not?
[01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:16.950]  No, you have to have individual bets with each of us.
[01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.650]  So that means if Nick doesn't stream,
[01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:21.230]  you all pay me 20 dollars?
[01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:22.410]  Yes. That's true.
[01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.750]  Hell yeah.
[01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:27.010]  Audience, you heard it.
[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.150]  Gavin owes us all 20 bucks.
[01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:30.630]  Nick, you want to stream next week?
[01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:32.830]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.930]  Awesome.
[01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.810]  This is where Gavin cuts a side deal
[01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.850]  offering Nick 40 if he doesn't stream.
[01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.330]  He still comes out ahead.
[01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:42.870]  Hell yeah. Still save money.
[01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.890]  Well,
[01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:46.650]  tune in next week to see
[01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:48.110]  if I can be bought.
[01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:51.550]  Or for how much.
[01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.950]  Or for how much.
[01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:54.830]  Because I will be bought either way.
[01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.250]  Also come back tomorrow at 4pm Central
[01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:59.230]  because we're going to be streaming
[01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.990]  What are we streaming tomorrow, Andrew?
[01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:04.850]  Mario Party. Jamboree.
[01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:07.150]  I thought you were going to jump right on that
[01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.150]  with the big reveal, but you really...
[01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:10.170]  My brain broke.
[01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:13.450]  I was trying to process if there was a super
[01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:14.990]  before the Mario Party.
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:16.210]  Is that what that was?
[01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:17.450]  And there is not.
[01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:20.510]  Well, I can promise that if you show up tomorrow
[01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:23.550]  at 4pm Central, either way, you're going to have a super time.
[01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.230]  Don't forget to go to
[01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:27.330]  Regulatrion.com
[01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:29.250]  to learn about ways to support us
[01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.730]  and give us money or eyeballs.
[01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:33.490]  We also like eyeballs or ears. Just give us your ears.
[01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:37.110]  Oh, Eric, you're not getting the $20. Thanks for watching!
[01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.630]  Bye!
