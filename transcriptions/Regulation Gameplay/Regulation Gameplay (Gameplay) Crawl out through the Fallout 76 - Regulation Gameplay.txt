[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Alright, let's uh, let's start the video here.
[00:02.880 --> 00:04.180]  I'm on a team.
[00:04.760 --> 00:06.340]  Uh, what does everybody wanna do?
[00:06.420 --> 00:08.040]  You guys got missions you're working on or anything?
[00:08.700 --> 00:10.540]  You're talking to, uh, uh,
[00:10.540 --> 00:12.440]  you're talking to Gavin, a guy who's like level 4.
[00:12.580 --> 00:14.640]  Who I think probably downloaded this game so we could do this video.
[00:15.120 --> 00:15.880]  I tell you something,
[00:16.280 --> 00:19.560]  I downloaded this video many, downloaded this game many years ago.
[00:19.740 --> 00:20.100]  Uh-huh.
[00:20.460 --> 00:22.120]  Because I've got a gun here,
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.940]  and it's called Quelm.
[00:24.380 --> 00:26.580]  Which I don't think is gonna be the actual name of this gun.
[00:26.640 --> 00:28.320]  I think I probably named it Quelm.
[00:29.080 --> 00:29.560]  Quelm.
[00:32.160 --> 00:32.640]  So,
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.760]  I think I've played this before,
[00:34.940 --> 00:35.380]  maybe
[00:36.960 --> 00:38.120]  six years ago.
[00:38.560 --> 00:39.860]  Is Bernie in this game?
[00:40.700 --> 00:42.000]  Bernie Batdog? Yeah.
[00:43.280 --> 00:43.760]  Probably.
[00:44.740 --> 00:46.820]  Should we go find him? Look directly to the east.
[00:47.640 --> 00:48.940]  To Morgantown Station.
[00:49.800 --> 00:50.280]  Uh...
[00:50.800 --> 00:52.800]  He's the little yellow dot. Yeah, let's go see him.
[00:53.040 --> 00:54.660]  Let's go find him. What? He's like, he's playing now?
[00:55.800 --> 00:56.920]  Uh, he's always playing.
[00:56.920 --> 00:58.600]  What? He's level, like, three million.
[00:59.040 --> 01:00.540]  Let's see. Who's this man?
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.820]  Ah! Oh. Dude, Quelm rules.
[01:03.940 --> 01:05.140]  Who's this man?
[01:06.160 --> 01:07.860]  Well, oh, uh, welcome to the video,
[01:08.060 --> 01:09.360]  guys. We're playing Fallout 76.
[01:10.620 --> 01:11.100]  Um...
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.420]  Gavin has a gun called Quelm.
[01:14.180 --> 01:14.800]  That's true.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.440]  Quelm does 4E damage. I love Quelm.
[01:17.600 --> 01:19.280]  Whoa! That's pretty good. Quelm rules.
[01:19.700 --> 01:21.340]  I've got, I've got a killer gang leader.
[01:21.520 --> 01:23.600]  Hunter for hire. So we wanna go see,
[01:23.880 --> 01:24.740]  see Burndog?
[01:25.340 --> 01:26.880]  Yeah, let's go see if we can find him. Let's go find him.
[01:27.220 --> 01:28.760]  You said he's over to the east somewhere?
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.360]  He's over by Morgantown station. We can fast travel to him,
[01:31.420 --> 01:32.900]  but I think just walking over there is gonna be fine.
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.160]  Let's just run. Yeah, let's take the adventure road.
[01:35.820 --> 01:37.360]  Imagine his face when all
[01:37.360 --> 01:38.980]  four of his best friends show up.
[01:43.360 --> 01:44.720]  Dude, he would be so happy.
[01:45.080 --> 01:46.640]  That guy wants nothing more.
[01:47.140 --> 01:49.140]  Bernie and Antonio both are the best, because they want
[01:49.140 --> 01:51.220]  nothing more than to play video games
[01:51.220 --> 01:53.020]  with friends. Yeah. And to be clear,
[01:53.020 --> 01:55.260]  when we're saying this is Bernie, because there's gonna be
[01:55.260 --> 01:56.240]  a bunch of people like,
[01:57.800 --> 01:59.060]  This is Batdog,
[01:59.220 --> 02:01.020]  this is Burndog that Geoff played
[02:01.020 --> 02:02.880]  trucks with. From trucks? Yeah.
[02:03.040 --> 02:05.200]  This is my wife's best friend's husband
[02:05.200 --> 02:07.100]  who's now become one of my
[02:07.100 --> 02:08.980]  best friends as well. And I'm about to do an interview
[02:08.980 --> 02:10.900]  with him for Saw Right. Oh, very cool.
[02:11.160 --> 02:13.080]  That's great. Yeah. Sounds like it's pretty
[02:13.080 --> 02:14.900]  easy to become your best friend. Yeah.
[02:15.500 --> 02:16.740]  It took Bernie and I like
[02:16.740 --> 02:18.800]  five years to get comfortable around each other.
[02:18.840 --> 02:21.000]  Oh, really? Oh, wow. Yeah. How long's it gonna
[02:21.000 --> 02:21.540]  take us?
[02:22.480 --> 02:24.880]  You and I, dude, I'm more comfortable
[02:24.880 --> 02:26.600]  around you than my wife. That's good.
[02:27.040 --> 02:27.960]  Wow, that's
[02:29.160 --> 02:31.040]  cool. It's not good.
[02:31.080 --> 02:31.680]  It's a problem.
[02:34.340 --> 02:35.220]  This settler
[02:35.220 --> 02:36.160]  guy, is this
[02:36.820 --> 02:39.040]  we shouldn't murder? No, you shouldn't
[02:39.040 --> 02:41.040]  not murder them. Do whatever you wanna do.
[02:41.160 --> 02:43.000]  Are you sure? This game's all
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.900]  about making the choices you wanna make.
[02:45.140 --> 02:47.000]  Can I take a wife
[02:47.000 --> 02:48.940]  in this game? I don't
[02:48.940 --> 02:50.300]  think so.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.760]  So I found it.
[02:53.180 --> 02:54.520]  Wow, this settler
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.420]  It's gonna be hard to break it to Meg.
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.660]  How do I activate vats again?
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.800]  Left bumper. Yeah.
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.040]  Man, this is one of those games
[03:05.040 --> 03:06.980]  follow all Bethesda games, I guess,
[03:07.040 --> 03:08.980]  but you don't play for a week.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.740]  And it's like you never played.
[03:11.020 --> 03:12.980]  We ran across a
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.840]  like a shrub that
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.660]  explodes, these firecracker berries explode.
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.780]  So when this game came out
[03:20.780 --> 03:22.660]  it wasn't very good, right? Correct.
[03:23.860 --> 03:24.840]  Yeah, there were no NPCs
[03:25.400 --> 03:26.780]  in the game when it came out
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.520]  and so it just felt very empty
[03:28.520 --> 03:30.900]  but they have continually
[03:31.500 --> 03:32.860]  updated it and then
[03:32.860 --> 03:34.460]  with the Fallout TV show
[03:34.460 --> 03:36.860]  this is like the best thing they have to throw
[03:36.860 --> 03:37.480]  people towards.
[03:38.520 --> 03:40.740]  It's crazy how I think
[03:40.740 --> 03:42.860]  sometimes the best marketing for a game is
[03:42.860 --> 03:44.220]  to have a really shitty game.
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.060]  Yeah. And then work on it
[03:46.060 --> 03:47.560]  while we've all paid for it.
[03:49.260 --> 03:50.100]  Dogs, Geoff!
[03:50.420 --> 03:51.040]  Behind you!
[03:54.450 --> 03:55.590]  I killed someone earlier.
[03:55.890 --> 03:57.370]  They don't walk, they just slide.
[03:58.570 --> 03:59.770]  Oh, slide dogs? Yeah.
[03:59.770 --> 04:01.950]  Yeah, slide dogs. The thing I really liked about
[04:01.950 --> 04:04.090]  this game coming in really late to it was
[04:04.090 --> 04:05.610]  running into people who were like
[04:06.070 --> 04:07.570]  way higher level than me
[04:07.570 --> 04:10.110]  who would just give me a bunch of stuff to start me
[04:10.110 --> 04:11.990]  like well on my way
[04:11.990 --> 04:13.930]  to like where I needed to be. That was the
[04:13.930 --> 04:16.030]  coolest thing. The cool thing
[04:16.030 --> 04:17.930]  about this game is it has
[04:17.930 --> 04:19.910]  from what I've seen, you know and I'm only
[04:19.910 --> 04:21.790]  level 44 here so I haven't played it a ton
[04:21.790 --> 04:23.790]  but it has the most supportive
[04:24.310 --> 04:25.930]  player base. It is crazy
[04:26.470 --> 04:27.970]  how supportive. Anytime you
[04:28.850 --> 04:29.810]  go to
[04:29.810 --> 04:32.110]  a train station, that's kind of where you go
[04:32.110 --> 04:32.670]  to
[04:33.690 --> 04:35.450]  like where you go to buy and sell stuff mostly
[04:35.450 --> 04:37.670]  and they'll be like one weapon
[04:37.670 --> 04:39.650]  bench or some kind of bench there for you too
[04:39.650 --> 04:42.270]  but they also will just have a public
[04:43.090 --> 04:43.710]  donation box
[04:43.710 --> 04:46.270]  or like a public crate donation box and people just fill
[04:46.270 --> 04:48.310]  it up all the time so you can just go up and grab whatever you need
[04:48.310 --> 04:50.370]  and then drop stuff off and people use it
[04:50.370 --> 04:51.770]  constantly. It's really neat. Wow.
[04:51.770 --> 04:54.270]  A lot of people will have their house out and when their house
[04:54.270 --> 04:56.050]  is out they'll have those out for you
[04:56.050 --> 04:58.270]  just go and like if you want to get a boost or a stat boost
[04:58.270 --> 05:00.250]  or something they'll just have it available for you. Like one of those library
[05:00.650 --> 05:01.070]  mailboxes. Yeah.
[05:02.050 --> 05:04.210]  Exactly. Exactly like a free library
[05:04.210 --> 05:06.290]  mailbox. Those things freak me out.
[05:07.090 --> 05:07.310]  Why?
[05:08.210 --> 05:10.030]  Well I'm always kind of intrigued as to what's in there
[05:10.030 --> 05:11.630]  but I'm always too scared to interact with one.
[05:12.150 --> 05:14.010]  Yeah, I mean I get that. Because then you have to
[05:14.010 --> 05:16.110]  approach the house. Yeah, and then people
[05:16.110 --> 05:18.010]  are going to be watching and they're going to be perving
[05:18.010 --> 05:19.850]  on me browsing the books. Yeah,
[05:19.970 --> 05:21.250]  that's how they get off.
[05:21.570 --> 05:23.070]  And will the books be minging?
[05:23.990 --> 05:25.970]  The second, it really
[05:25.970 --> 05:28.050]  is just like a fetish thing, the second you open
[05:28.050 --> 05:29.910]  that little door there's a dude behind
[05:29.910 --> 05:31.730]  blinds with his dick in his hand.
[05:33.690 --> 05:34.090]  Another
[05:34.090 --> 05:35.790]  one for the trap. Well boys,
[05:35.930 --> 05:38.150]  I don't know where Burn Dog went but he ain't here.
[05:38.650 --> 05:40.130]  Oh, you want to go kill a
[05:40.130 --> 05:40.950]  gang leader?
[05:41.630 --> 05:42.710]  Yeah, let's go do it.
[05:44.110 --> 05:45.810]  Let's go follow you, Gavel, do your mission.
[05:46.350 --> 05:48.190]  You've been playing quite a bit, huh, Eric?
[05:48.870 --> 05:50.130]  I've had this game
[05:50.130 --> 05:52.030]  for a while, I just didn't know it was going to transfer
[05:52.030 --> 05:53.130]  over to my
[05:54.610 --> 05:56.050]  Xbox? Yeah, my new Xbox.
[05:56.290 --> 05:57.410]  I call it Sexbox.
[05:58.230 --> 05:58.810]  Yeah, nice.
[06:00.150 --> 06:01.450]  I just think it's cool.
[06:02.230 --> 06:03.830]  But yeah, I like this game.
[06:03.950 --> 06:04.650]  I just get
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.510]  I get bored
[06:06.510 --> 06:08.670]  with it because I only play it by myself.
[06:08.810 --> 06:09.870]  Oh, what the fuck?
[06:11.530 --> 06:12.710]  It's a lot of fun
[06:12.710 --> 06:13.770]  if you do the world
[06:14.470 --> 06:14.710]  activities.
[06:15.050 --> 06:15.190]  No!
[06:19.010 --> 06:20.510]  Oh, he's just walking
[06:20.510 --> 06:21.810]  his dogs. Oh!
[06:22.790 --> 06:23.750]  Oh no!
[06:24.530 --> 06:24.630]  Guys!
[06:26.570 --> 06:28.190]  He was just walking his dogs.
[06:28.950 --> 06:30.070]  Look, they weren't...
[06:30.070 --> 06:30.570]  Oh, shit.
[06:30.570 --> 06:30.590]  Oh, shit.
[06:35.730 --> 06:36.610]  Okay, so...
[06:37.210 --> 06:38.510]  Did you murder someone
[06:38.510 --> 06:40.430]  while I was in the map? Just the dogs.
[06:40.670 --> 06:42.170]  Yeah, this guy was...
[06:42.170 --> 06:43.890]  Why, did your thing go away?
[06:44.850 --> 06:46.430]  No, I just got bit a little bit.
[06:46.690 --> 06:47.330]  Oh, yes, yeah.
[06:47.650 --> 06:48.090]  Dog.
[06:50.470 --> 06:51.350]  Follow me!
[06:51.810 --> 06:52.150]  Alright!
[06:54.050 --> 06:56.170]  Do we want to walk there or fast travel there?
[06:56.690 --> 06:57.970]  Well, where is it?
[06:59.350 --> 07:00.070]  Oh, it's
[07:00.610 --> 07:01.690]  WV Lumber Co.
[07:02.610 --> 07:04.170]  Okay, we'll fast travel there.
[07:04.270 --> 07:05.230]  Yeah, we should definitely fast travel.
[07:05.330 --> 07:07.690]  We should fast travel to... Oh, man.
[07:07.790 --> 07:09.950]  I don't know if... They're not gonna have these spots
[07:09.950 --> 07:11.970]  open, Geoff. They're not.
[07:12.050 --> 07:13.250]  Can we fast travel to each other?
[07:13.710 --> 07:14.770]  Yeah, we can travel to each other.
[07:15.070 --> 07:17.130]  Oh, you know what you can do? You can fast travel to my camp.
[07:17.510 --> 07:18.910]  Where's your camp, too? Can you see it?
[07:20.910 --> 07:22.190]  Fast travel to Geoff's camp.
[07:23.890 --> 07:24.610]  Go up
[07:24.610 --> 07:25.870]  from Fallout 76.
[07:25.870 --> 07:27.010]  I mean, we're all here.
[07:27.850 --> 07:29.010]  Oh, okay. A vault!
[07:30.510 --> 07:31.370]  Oh, yeah, that's my vault.
[07:31.870 --> 07:33.810]  Alright, you guys ready? You can have your own vault?
[07:34.250 --> 07:34.790]  What? Yeah.
[07:35.630 --> 07:37.730]  That's my vault. The big thing in this game is
[07:37.730 --> 07:39.850]  building your, like, shelter, like, your
[07:39.850 --> 07:41.950]  spot, like, building a camp out and everything.
[07:42.830 --> 07:44.490]  I hate it. I despise it.
[07:44.710 --> 07:46.110]  I don't want to do it. Couldn't care less about it.
[07:46.150 --> 07:48.070]  I hate it so much. It is...
[07:48.070 --> 07:49.710]  It's all Bernie and Antonio
[07:49.710 --> 07:51.850]  care about. I love the idea
[07:51.850 --> 07:53.930]  of it, but I hate Fallout Clunk
[07:53.930 --> 07:56.330]  and the placement of stuff and clunkage.
[07:56.430 --> 07:57.890]  And, boy, welcome to Fallout Clunk. We're getting
[07:57.890 --> 08:00.210]  fuckin' radiated like crazy here, by the way.
[08:00.310 --> 08:01.690]  Oh, yeah, there's probably some radiation.
[08:01.910 --> 08:03.490]  You can get, uh, you guys just wanna
[08:04.030 --> 08:05.650]  take care of that. Stay out of the water, too.
[08:05.970 --> 08:07.990]  Do you think this red water is causing some of my
[08:07.990 --> 08:09.250]  radiation? Maybe some.
[08:09.690 --> 08:11.870]  If you ever go into Burndog's house, it looks like
[08:11.870 --> 08:13.550]  a TGI Fridays on steroids.
[08:14.450 --> 08:16.130]  Some people get, like, real into it.
[08:16.210 --> 08:17.930]  Okay, so I think we need to go...
[08:18.990 --> 08:20.010]  Yeah, I think you guys are going
[08:20.010 --> 08:21.970]  the right way. I think it's up. We gotta go, like,
[08:21.970 --> 08:24.210]  up this mountain. I have to kill this
[08:24.210 --> 08:25.330]  gang leader, too, actually.
[08:25.810 --> 08:28.030]  You haven't done the gang leader? You haven't killed this guy?
[08:28.890 --> 08:30.010]  I don't think so. I was, like,
[08:30.050 --> 08:31.950]  level 12 when I met up with Bernie and
[08:31.950 --> 08:33.450]  Antonio, and I just started doing their shit.
[08:33.850 --> 08:36.110]  Jesus. I basically
[08:36.110 --> 08:37.910]  just went through. You know the robot
[08:37.910 --> 08:40.070]  lady that's in the... I just
[08:40.070 --> 08:41.530]  finished all her shit. Oh, wow.
[08:42.070 --> 08:44.030]  You're level 14? That's crazy. I mostly
[08:44.030 --> 08:46.030]  just kinda, like, I just roam around, you know?
[08:46.450 --> 08:48.130]  Is this better as a single player game
[08:48.130 --> 08:49.990]  or a team game? No, it's
[08:49.990 --> 08:51.230]  definitely better as a team game. I think it's better as a team game.
[08:51.550 --> 08:53.990]  It's, like, I really wanna like it as a single player
[08:53.990 --> 08:55.610]  game, and I don't think I do.
[08:56.570 --> 08:57.990]  Bernie plays it as a
[08:58.590 --> 09:00.050]  solo game, but
[09:00.050 --> 09:02.290]  he's, like, makes friends with the community.
[09:02.550 --> 09:04.050]  Yeah. Yeah, so it's like they all,
[09:04.130 --> 09:05.890]  like, there's a lot of
[09:05.890 --> 09:08.010]  really fun world events. Yeah, there's, like,
[09:08.030 --> 09:10.050]  a lot of stuff to do. That's the whole game. But, like,
[09:10.610 --> 09:11.170]  you know,
[09:12.830 --> 09:13.990]  it's just not...
[09:15.210 --> 09:16.070]  It's probably just
[09:16.070 --> 09:18.190]  better as a full-on game.
[09:18.190 --> 09:20.290]  Social thing, yeah. Yeah, like a lot of people.
[09:20.410 --> 09:22.310]  And I don't play any online games. I hate online games.
[09:22.890 --> 09:23.870]  Because I was playing with Dan
[09:23.870 --> 09:26.010]  when it came out, and I feel like we were struggling to
[09:26.010 --> 09:27.510]  do stuff together. Yeah.
[09:27.930 --> 09:30.090]  Well, that's because it just,
[09:30.210 --> 09:31.890]  the game wasn't really, nah,
[09:32.470 --> 09:33.790]  fully realized yet at that point.
[09:34.030 --> 09:36.150]  One person just has to pick something, and then everyone
[09:36.150 --> 09:37.930]  goes and does it. Yeah.
[09:38.110 --> 09:40.210]  Like, what we're doing now, I think, is the way that you're supposed
[09:40.210 --> 09:42.230]  to play. I can't wait to introduce
[09:42.230 --> 09:43.670]  this gang leader to Qwelm.
[09:44.370 --> 09:45.390]  Oh, hang on.
[09:45.390 --> 09:47.470]  Everyone come here to me for just a second.
[09:47.690 --> 09:49.430]  I just remembered. Who gets the kill
[09:49.430 --> 09:51.130]  in the end? Oh, you're gonna open something?
[09:51.310 --> 09:53.790]  Yeah, I have a lunchbox.
[09:53.870 --> 09:55.310]  I do too, now that you know. Oh, shit.
[09:55.790 --> 09:57.330]  Whoa. Whoa.
[09:57.530 --> 09:59.110]  Hell yeah, dude. What you giving us?
[09:59.690 --> 10:00.490]  I don't know. Reduced damage. Reduced cake.
[10:01.130 --> 10:03.110]  Oh, did you get reduced damage? Yeah.
[10:03.150 --> 10:05.150]  Reduced damage from other players till you attack them back.
[10:05.470 --> 10:06.970]  Cool. That's great.
[10:08.730 --> 10:09.470]  Let's, uh...
[10:09.470 --> 10:10.310]  You gonna open one too?
[10:11.090 --> 10:11.490]  Oh!
[10:11.490 --> 10:12.150]  Oh!
[10:13.090 --> 10:15.490]  So much cake. Finger trap
[10:15.490 --> 10:17.630]  party favor. Finger trap party
[10:17.630 --> 10:19.370]  favor is the one that I got,
[10:19.510 --> 10:21.670]  and then Geoff just got us so much
[10:21.670 --> 10:23.610]  cake. What, our fingers are all
[10:23.610 --> 10:24.430]  in each other?
[10:25.790 --> 10:27.490]  They're just bonuses for
[10:27.490 --> 10:29.170]  like an hour, I think.
[10:29.830 --> 10:31.230]  There's some ghouls over here, I think.
[10:31.550 --> 10:32.090]  To the west.
[10:33.350 --> 10:35.450]  Yeah, we got some ghouls over here. Watch out,
[10:35.710 --> 10:37.570]  barrel ghoul! Maybe we should do an episode
[10:37.570 --> 10:39.610]  where we go and
[10:39.610 --> 10:40.950]  visit Burndog, and then we
[10:41.450 --> 10:42.870]  have him give us a tour of his hut.
[10:43.710 --> 10:45.750]  Oh, we absolutely should do that.
[10:45.970 --> 10:47.470]  We should do like
[10:47.470 --> 10:49.390]  the Fallout world according to Burndog, yeah.
[10:50.010 --> 10:51.490]  Any of those people that know
[10:52.430 --> 10:53.050]  the game
[10:53.630 --> 10:55.550]  ridiculously well always have so much interesting
[10:55.550 --> 10:57.470]  information about it. Hang on, I'm fighting
[10:57.470 --> 10:59.690]  a bunch of ghouls. I always find it so strange
[10:59.690 --> 11:01.370]  when I can't get into a game in a
[11:01.370 --> 11:03.670]  franchise I love. Like this one just never works for me
[11:03.670 --> 11:04.990]  for some reason. I love Fallout.
[11:05.230 --> 11:07.590]  Yeah, me too. But the TV show brought
[11:07.590 --> 11:09.250]  me back, and it has been awesome.
[11:09.470 --> 11:11.610]  And let me tell you, the thing that's cool about this
[11:11.610 --> 11:13.170]  game that I missed the first time,
[11:13.650 --> 11:15.010]  because I guess it wasn't really fully there,
[11:15.290 --> 11:16.690]  is that this is the closest,
[11:17.430 --> 11:19.130]  like this is the earliest game in the timeline.
[11:19.490 --> 11:21.590]  So we're the closest to when the nuclear bomb went off.
[11:21.870 --> 11:21.950]  Oh.
[11:23.030 --> 11:25.530]  It's only like 60 or 70 or 30
[11:25.530 --> 11:26.630]  or 40 years after
[11:27.530 --> 11:29.310]  the initial nuclear explosion.
[11:29.710 --> 11:31.530]  There's a shitload of ghouls over there.
[11:31.850 --> 11:33.090]  I mean, I just, uh,
[11:33.790 --> 11:35.210]  I watched the show and then played
[11:35.210 --> 11:37.290]  New Vegas and then got back into
[11:37.290 --> 11:39.110]  4. Because 4
[11:39.110 --> 11:41.230]  was, they just did like that update.
[11:42.390 --> 11:43.330]  There's an update to 4?
[11:43.670 --> 11:45.350]  Yeah, it's like, uh, well if you play
[11:45.350 --> 11:47.110]  on PC it's not really anything to you, but
[11:47.110 --> 11:49.010]  if you play on console, pretty like vanilla,
[11:49.570 --> 11:51.330]  it's a, uh, it's a nice little upgrade
[11:51.330 --> 11:52.750]  where it's like 60 frames and everything.
[11:53.130 --> 11:55.330]  Oh, very nice. I was gonna go and play
[11:55.330 --> 11:57.310]  it, actually, and then I decided to do this instead.
[11:57.510 --> 11:59.010]  Yeah, you know, it's not a bad choice.
[11:59.290 --> 12:00.970]  It's, it's fun. Like,
[12:01.090 --> 12:03.130]  I do enjoy, as much as maybe I'm not,
[12:03.130 --> 12:05.290]  like, I don't love doing this stuff like day-to-day,
[12:05.390 --> 12:06.510]  like, it feels like doing chores.
[12:07.410 --> 12:08.130]  This is...
[12:08.830 --> 12:09.970]  Well, that's any MMO, right?
[12:10.550 --> 12:12.150]  Yeah, exactly. And that's why I don't play it.
[12:12.150 --> 12:14.950]  You log in every day to get your free shit, and to do your
[12:14.950 --> 12:17.330]  daily chores. Do your work.
[12:17.410 --> 12:19.150]  Do your fucking job. Head to work
[12:19.150 --> 12:20.810]  before you go to work. Yeah, I do that
[12:21.190 --> 12:23.370]  on, like, MLB The Show. Like, that's
[12:23.910 --> 12:24.630]  that's my chores.
[12:25.230 --> 12:25.590]  Whoa!
[12:26.750 --> 12:28.890]  What'd you find? Nothing. I was just
[12:29.370 --> 12:31.210]  reacting to you. Oh, you're doing, like,
[12:31.210 --> 12:33.270]  oh, that's fun. I thought maybe you, like, ran into, like, a bear.
[12:33.670 --> 12:35.270]  That would be cool. That happens a lot.
[12:35.330 --> 12:37.330]  They're bears? Well, that happens a lot. A yow-gwai?
[12:37.410 --> 12:39.070]  Whatever they're called in Eskimo? Yeah, yeah, yowie-gowie
[12:39.070 --> 12:41.290]  or whatever. Yeah, yeah, Geoff. They're definitely
[12:41.290 --> 12:42.410]  in here. Yeah, it's a yowie.
[12:43.010 --> 12:44.430]  Good ol' yowie-gwowie.
[12:44.570 --> 12:46.330]  Yowie-gowie. Yowie-mando.
[12:47.070 --> 12:47.250]  Yeah.
[12:49.070 --> 12:50.490]  This is yowie-do-it.
[12:53.650 --> 12:54.470]  Oh, I found him!
[12:54.970 --> 12:57.050]  The, the, the... gang leader.
[12:57.790 --> 12:59.230]  Well, hold on, let me get a shot at him, too,
[12:59.230 --> 13:01.190]  because I also have to kill him. Oh. I would also
[13:01.190 --> 13:03.270]  like to kill the man. I mean, I guess it doesn't
[13:03.270 --> 13:04.730]  matter. So should we all hit him once?
[13:05.370 --> 13:07.210]  I think we do, I think we do it as a party
[13:07.210 --> 13:09.250]  and it counts. I wonder if we should go and talk to him
[13:09.250 --> 13:10.830]  and try and get him to kill himself.
[13:11.170 --> 13:13.510]  You can. Uh... Oh, my favorite.
[13:13.550 --> 13:15.330]  I think I ended up not killing
[13:15.330 --> 13:17.010]  him. I think I talked him through something,
[13:17.130 --> 13:19.510]  because that's typically what I do in these games. Oh, okay. But...
[13:19.510 --> 13:20.950]  But... I'm gonna go and blow his head off.
[13:21.070 --> 13:22.890]  I was gonna say, does not make for a better video.
[13:23.690 --> 13:23.950]  Yeah.
[13:24.970 --> 13:27.230]  There's a man. I'm gonna go press the button and see if the...
[13:27.230 --> 13:28.710]  Yeah. They open fire.
[13:31.410 --> 13:31.850]  Activate.
[13:33.150 --> 13:34.110]  I'm gonna talk to your boss.
[13:34.790 --> 13:36.550]  Let me know when to pull the fucking trigger. I got eyes.
[13:38.130 --> 13:39.170]  Uh, I'm gonna say
[13:39.170 --> 13:40.790]  the password is see you in hell.
[13:41.190 --> 13:43.410]  Okay. Uh-oh. You are leaving the ski resort.
[13:43.570 --> 13:45.370]  You can die. This is your decision.
[13:45.570 --> 13:46.910]  Oh, shit! Didn't work.
[13:48.430 --> 13:49.030]  What's his problem?
[13:49.350 --> 13:50.170]  Negotiations have failed.
[13:51.450 --> 13:52.550]  Ah! Ah! Turret!
[13:53.850 --> 13:54.290]  Nice.
[13:55.470 --> 13:56.070]  Uh...
[13:56.070 --> 13:57.410]  How do we get in there now?
[13:57.750 --> 13:59.790]  You can open the gate, but we can go up and around.
[14:00.550 --> 14:01.310]  Push button.
[14:02.230 --> 14:04.110]  Oh, wow. That was easy. All right.
[14:04.870 --> 14:06.030]  They should have a better button.
[14:06.390 --> 14:06.710]  Yeah.
[14:07.830 --> 14:10.210]  The intercom button's malfunctioned again.
[14:10.770 --> 14:11.710]  Next time.
[14:14.970 --> 14:15.570]  Hello?
[14:17.790 --> 14:18.390]  Get
[14:18.390 --> 14:19.110]  quelmed!
[14:20.790 --> 14:22.110]  Are they over-quelmed?
[14:23.550 --> 14:24.350]  Oh, shit.
[14:24.670 --> 14:25.990]  Ooh, that guy blew to pieces.
[14:26.630 --> 14:28.250]  Ah! I feel like that was the potential
[14:28.250 --> 14:29.630]  to be friends with all these people.
[14:30.030 --> 14:30.730]  Yes. Probably.
[14:32.350 --> 14:34.050]  Can't be friends with corpses, Gavin.
[14:34.490 --> 14:36.090]  Don't cut to my footage through any of this.
[14:36.210 --> 14:37.450]  I'm climbing around rocks.
[14:37.790 --> 14:38.610]  Is it not going well?
[14:39.030 --> 14:42.110]  I was sniping, and then the sniping quickly
[14:42.110 --> 14:44.030]  ran out, so now I'm just running to catch up to you guys.
[14:45.610 --> 14:46.130]  Did we
[14:46.130 --> 14:46.830]  kill the right guy?
[14:47.270 --> 14:48.270]  No, he's inside.
[14:50.890 --> 14:51.410]  Hey, guys.
[14:51.490 --> 14:51.950]  Check it out.
[14:53.250 --> 14:53.990]  Did you die?
[14:54.150 --> 14:55.410]  Did I just fucking
[14:57.050 --> 14:58.110]  cucumber myself? God
[14:58.510 --> 14:59.870]  damn it. You became a cucumber?
[15:00.610 --> 15:02.490]  Yeah, I cucumbered. Let me see. What am I at?
[15:04.030 --> 15:04.330]  All right.
[15:04.410 --> 15:06.290]  I found the door he's in.
[15:06.310 --> 15:08.410]  Don't run too far ahead. We gotta clear the rest. I think clear the rest of this
[15:08.410 --> 15:09.130]  out, and then we can do it.
[15:09.750 --> 15:11.870]  Help team lead a solo quest inactive.
[15:12.050 --> 15:14.150]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[15:16.030 --> 15:16.510]  I forgot.
[15:16.510 --> 15:17.450]  The game does not pause.
[15:17.690 --> 15:19.210]  Where is that coming from?
[15:19.550 --> 15:21.050]  Where are we getting shot from?
[15:21.410 --> 15:23.430]  So, I guess the team leader needs to
[15:24.850 --> 15:25.650]  needs to what?
[15:25.850 --> 15:27.030]  Activate this quest or something?
[15:27.330 --> 15:29.570]  So, Eric needs to activate this quest?
[15:30.090 --> 15:31.550]  I think I already did it, though.
[15:33.190 --> 15:33.510]  Ah!
[15:34.070 --> 15:35.670]  How do I start a team quest?
[15:37.030 --> 15:38.430]  This says enter as team
[15:38.430 --> 15:39.550]  leader. Do you want me to do that?
[15:39.790 --> 15:40.870]  Oh, yeah, yeah. Do that.
[15:42.050 --> 15:43.050]  Did that take you in?
[15:43.370 --> 15:45.310]  Help team leader. Yes, I can go in now.
[15:45.570 --> 15:46.890]  Wait. I'm on my way.
[15:47.090 --> 15:48.930]  I can't do it yet. Oh, right. I forgot I'm cucumbered.
[15:48.950 --> 15:51.230]  I'll be there in a second. What does it mean to be cucumbered?
[15:51.350 --> 15:52.250]  Yeah, what is that?
[15:53.010 --> 15:54.950]  Over-encumbered? He's over-encumbered.
[15:57.510 --> 15:58.370]  Help your team leader.
[15:59.270 --> 16:00.670]  Alright. We gotta wait for Nick, though.
[16:01.650 --> 16:02.570]  Yep. I'm coming.
[16:04.710 --> 16:05.210]  I'm coming.
[16:05.470 --> 16:05.810]  I'm right here.
[16:07.890 --> 16:10.190]  Oh, shit.
[16:10.190 --> 16:11.270]  I'll continue.
[16:14.780 --> 16:15.220]  Okay.
[16:15.740 --> 16:17.100]  What the? I'm inside Geoff.
[16:17.540 --> 16:17.720]  Ah!
[16:19.080 --> 16:19.800]  You're welcome.
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.640]  I leveled up!
[16:23.640 --> 16:25.240]  Uh, brewing station.
[16:25.500 --> 16:27.400]  Dude's on the steps. Dude's on the steps, Geoff.
[16:27.560 --> 16:28.060]  Is that the man?
[16:29.100 --> 16:30.680]  No. Okay.
[16:31.400 --> 16:33.080]  Let's all go upstairs and light this guy up.
[16:33.400 --> 16:33.700]  Alright.
[16:35.020 --> 16:37.340]  Maybe he is dead. Oh, is that him?
[16:37.340 --> 16:37.420]  Is that him?
[16:39.180 --> 16:41.200]  As soon as I helped Eric with his quest,
[16:41.360 --> 16:43.040]  I think my quest went away.
[16:43.460 --> 16:43.840]  Really?
[16:44.300 --> 16:46.500]  I think this is what happened when I tried to play with Dan.
[16:46.560 --> 16:47.660]  We couldn't do anything together.
[16:47.940 --> 16:50.940]  Yeah. This sucks. I don't know what you're supposed to do.
[16:51.400 --> 16:52.680]  There's a tunnel under this base.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.000]  Oh, maybe he's in there.
[16:54.460 --> 16:55.300]  I think he is.
[16:57.080 --> 16:58.160]  Oh, we haven't killed him yet?
[17:02.900 --> 17:04.540]  Hey, everyone.
[17:08.540 --> 17:09.760]  Oh, is that another guy?
[17:11.400 --> 17:13.140]  I can't interact with either of them.
[17:13.340 --> 17:14.220]  Maybe Eric has to.
[17:17.040 --> 17:18.020]  He just says what.
[17:19.280 --> 17:20.460]  Can't take a hint, huh?
[17:20.580 --> 17:23.040]  Only the leader can perform this action in a team instance.
[17:25.600 --> 17:26.440]  Go ahead, leader.
[17:26.900 --> 17:28.520]  I'm talking to him. Nothing happens.
[17:29.180 --> 17:30.300]  Oh, this is it. Tilt to this guy.
[17:30.920 --> 17:31.360]  Oh, Roper.
[17:31.480 --> 17:34.660]  What happens?
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.980]  He says go on, shoot. Kill him.
[17:37.800 --> 17:37.980]  Okay.
[17:38.600 --> 17:39.600]  Alright, he made his choice.
[17:40.780 --> 17:41.700]  I can't hit him.
[17:41.980 --> 17:43.080]  You can't.
[17:43.840 --> 17:49.360]  I have a feeling the person who is the team leader has to be the active quest holder.
[17:54.560 --> 17:57.300]  Alright, now I think you talk to these guys before you shoot them.
[17:57.300 --> 17:59.880]  You just talk to them and then we can fucking waste them.
[18:01.320 --> 18:01.680]  Interact.
[18:01.920 --> 18:04.640]  He wants to know what I want.
[18:06.120 --> 18:07.220]  Hugs and kisses, baby.
[18:08.100 --> 18:09.180]  Oh, I can join his crew.
[18:09.680 --> 18:10.360]  That sucks.
[18:10.480 --> 18:12.160]  I want you to leave the wayward alone.
[18:14.960 --> 18:15.280]  Strength 8.
[18:15.400 --> 18:17.260]  Because if you don't, I'll rip you all in from them.
[18:17.360 --> 18:17.940]  Can't do that.
[18:18.340 --> 18:19.940]  I can attack and say,
[18:20.280 --> 18:22.720]  because you'll be dead if you don't.
[18:23.180 --> 18:23.880]  That's true.
[18:24.300 --> 18:26.740]  Alright. Ransom!
[18:27.040 --> 18:27.660]  Oh, shit.
[18:29.380 --> 18:30.580]  Jackie didn't make it.
[18:31.440 --> 18:32.100]  It worked.
[18:32.940 --> 18:34.300]  I thought that was going to be a fight,
[18:34.400 --> 18:35.780]  but he seemed to go down in one hit.
[18:36.620 --> 18:37.340]  Oh, yeah.
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.060]  I need to leave a message for the gang.
[18:43.340 --> 18:44.340]  Was that enough of a message?
[18:44.860 --> 18:46.980]  I think that's a pretty clear message.
[18:48.640 --> 18:49.900]  Can I write them a note?
[18:50.540 --> 18:51.860]  Oh, here's where I can leave a message.
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.280]  What's your message?
[18:56.440 --> 18:57.160]  Don't know yet.
[18:57.900 --> 18:59.000]  Leave the gang a message.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.500]  Oh, scroll message.
[19:00.860 --> 19:01.340]  Okay.
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.460]  What? Did everything go dark?
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.980]  Ow, ow, ow.
[19:11.160 --> 19:12.360]  There's people upstairs.
[19:13.760 --> 19:14.440]  That we didn't kill.
[19:15.340 --> 19:17.000]  Oh, look at my message that I've left them.
[19:17.300 --> 19:17.800]  Is it cool?
[19:18.280 --> 19:19.600]  It's not very cool.
[19:20.460 --> 19:22.000]  Leave the wayward alone.
[19:22.060 --> 19:24.260]  Hey, but you know what? You spelled it all right.
[19:25.940 --> 19:26.900]  They're all dead.
[19:26.980 --> 19:27.820]  Who's going to read it?
[19:27.820 --> 19:29.280]  I will say that's better than I thought.
[19:29.440 --> 19:30.160]  Way to go.
[19:31.300 --> 19:33.300]  Well, just in case anybody was on vacation.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.060]  That's fair.
[19:34.580 --> 19:38.380]  I wish I'd scrolled it in feces.
[19:38.840 --> 19:39.680]  Yeah, that would've been cool.
[19:39.940 --> 19:40.780]  That's a real message.
[19:41.420 --> 19:43.960]  Hey, there's a metal chest piece here
[19:43.960 --> 19:44.900]  if anybody wants it.
[19:45.080 --> 19:47.740]  And a pair of fashionable sunglasses.
[19:47.820 --> 19:48.200]  I'm going to take those.
[19:48.440 --> 19:50.900]  You guys didn't even get a chance.
[19:51.700 --> 19:53.320]  Well, Gavin, what's the next step in your quest?
[19:54.100 --> 19:55.040]  What are we doing for you, bud?
[19:55.040 --> 19:56.320]  Well, we could turn that in,
[19:56.440 --> 19:57.680]  or I guess we could do something cooler.
[19:58.080 --> 19:59.140]  Well, let's do something cool.
[19:59.740 --> 20:01.260]  Okay, let's go back outside.
[20:01.560 --> 20:04.340]  If you want to promote me to leader,
[20:04.440 --> 20:06.560]  I have a quest over here that's just to the northwest.
[20:06.960 --> 20:07.700]  Let's do that.
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.680]  I don't know what it is.
[20:10.800 --> 20:12.760]  It's just a visit the Shelter's Claim Center
[20:12.760 --> 20:13.280]  is all it says.
[20:13.800 --> 20:18.140]  Can you combine shit to repair it?
[20:18.140 --> 20:20.100]  There's a lot of dickheads out here still.
[20:20.420 --> 20:21.420]  Oh, like repair stuff?
[20:21.460 --> 20:22.660]  You have to repair stuff at a workbench.
[20:22.660 --> 20:24.500]  It has to be a specific workbench.
[20:24.700 --> 20:25.500]  I'm going to stop.
[20:25.580 --> 20:27.940]  As soon as we get out of this little shit town, I'm going to stop.
[20:28.260 --> 20:28.960]  For what?
[20:29.640 --> 20:32.260]  I'm going to drop my caravan real fast so I can dump stuff.
[20:32.420 --> 20:33.080]  Like your camp?
[20:33.860 --> 20:34.260]  Yeah.
[20:35.820 --> 20:38.820]  Do you have a small one that you carry with you or something?
[20:39.520 --> 20:39.900]  Yes.
[20:40.200 --> 20:40.680]  Oh, cool.
[20:41.960 --> 20:43.820]  I never thought about doing that. It's a really good idea.
[20:44.980 --> 20:45.940]  He's a shtick.
[20:46.580 --> 20:48.680]  How you doing back there, Nick?
[20:49.200 --> 20:50.240]  I'm just getting shot.
[20:53.580 --> 20:54.220]  Geoff, where are you going?
[20:55.120 --> 20:56.580]  I'm just trying to fucking get out of here.
[20:56.700 --> 20:58.220]  Over here. Over where I am.
[20:59.820 --> 21:01.180]  Well, you said northeast, right?
[21:01.540 --> 21:03.140]  Right, and we're inside of a thing,
[21:03.200 --> 21:04.820]  so we have to get out of here and then we can do it, I think.
[21:04.840 --> 21:06.480]  Yeah, I'm going to go out this door and then I'm outside.
[21:06.600 --> 21:09.000]  What? Just finding secret doors.
[21:09.900 --> 21:10.820]  I'm getting shot a lot.
[21:11.240 --> 21:12.780]  Ow, ow. Bastards.
[21:13.220 --> 21:14.340]  Come over. I might get killed.
[21:15.020 --> 21:15.480]  Don't do that.
[21:15.480 --> 21:16.220]  Oh, shit.
[21:21.850 --> 21:22.410]  Damn mofo.
[21:22.410 --> 21:24.410]  Alright, got it.
[21:30.070 --> 21:33.590]  Well, I'm dead.
[21:34.790 --> 21:36.230]  Let me place...
[21:36.230 --> 21:36.850]  Ah, here we go.
[21:38.670 --> 21:39.690]  Oh, Jesus.
[21:47.370 --> 21:48.610]  That's my first ever
[21:48.610 --> 21:49.510]  tent jump scare.
[21:51.230 --> 21:51.950]  Okay, so...
[21:51.950 --> 21:53.670]  I'll drop a...
[21:53.670 --> 21:54.390]  Let me see.
[21:55.010 --> 21:56.230]  Make only this active.
[21:57.470 --> 21:59.070]  I just dropped a waypoint.
[21:59.410 --> 22:00.870]  I just dropped a waypoint, so that way...
[22:00.870 --> 22:01.970]  Do you guys see that at all?
[22:02.330 --> 22:03.090]  What does it look like?
[22:04.390 --> 22:07.730]  A little dot on the map that says my custom destination.
[22:07.890 --> 22:09.070]  I just don't know if that's...
[22:09.070 --> 22:10.750]  Oh, let me try and find it on my map.
[22:11.190 --> 22:11.870]  Oh, yeah, I see it.
[22:12.170 --> 22:13.930]  Okay, that's about where we're headed.
[22:14.810 --> 22:15.890]  Oh, like directly east.
[22:15.890 --> 22:17.350]  Oh, that's right next to my
[22:17.350 --> 22:18.890]  find-out-what-the-key-unlocks.
[22:19.110 --> 22:19.910]  Oh, that's cool.
[22:20.710 --> 22:22.650]  I wonder if you have the key for the shelter's claim.
[22:24.790 --> 22:25.850]  You guys ready?
[22:25.990 --> 22:26.250]  Geoff, you ready?
[22:26.910 --> 22:27.990]  Uh, yeah, let me go get my outfit.
[22:28.450 --> 22:28.830]  Where'd it go?
[22:30.230 --> 22:33.150]  Well, it didn't go far, because we couldn't steal it.
[22:34.170 --> 22:35.690]  Let me go get my outfit on.
[22:36.670 --> 22:37.390]  The costume.
[22:38.170 --> 22:38.530]  Meow.
[22:39.470 --> 22:40.970]  Man, I can't sprint for very long.
[22:41.230 --> 22:41.950]  No, me neither.
[22:42.350 --> 22:43.950]  I wonder if I have anything...
[22:44.830 --> 22:46.050]  Let me see if I have anything I can give you
[22:46.050 --> 22:48.050]  that increases stamina for a while.
[22:48.130 --> 22:49.710]  Or apply some cards or whatever.
[22:50.270 --> 22:52.090]  The leveling system's wild
[22:52.090 --> 22:52.850]  in this game.
[22:53.630 --> 22:54.250]  Good wild?
[22:55.130 --> 22:58.050]  Just complicated. It's all about playing cards and assigning them
[22:58.050 --> 22:59.730]  and combining them
[22:59.730 --> 23:02.050]  and it's special,
[23:02.230 --> 23:03.710]  but it's like the most complicated form of special.
[23:04.990 --> 23:05.830]  Every once in a while,
[23:05.930 --> 23:08.110]  Bernie just goes through them for me and tells me to read out
[23:08.110 --> 23:09.770]  what I have and then he tells me what to do.
[23:09.770 --> 23:10.170]  Hahaha.
[23:14.510 --> 23:15.530]  Is this your guy?
[23:15.970 --> 23:16.170]  No.
[23:17.030 --> 23:17.830]  This is just a guy.
[23:20.030 --> 23:21.350]  Just a guy with stuff here.
[23:21.870 --> 23:22.630]  Can we knock him off?
[23:23.510 --> 23:24.370]  Uh, I guess.
[23:24.710 --> 23:25.270]  Not too close.
[23:29.590 --> 23:30.970]  Oh god, what'd you do to him?
[23:33.670 --> 23:34.670]  He's mad and he's hiding.
[23:35.190 --> 23:35.850]  Who's he going after?
[23:37.570 --> 23:38.890]  I don't know. Geoff?
[23:39.450 --> 23:40.570]  He senses a threat.
[23:40.810 --> 23:42.190]  He does. Alright, he's out of there.
[23:42.330 --> 23:43.010]  Alright, let's keep going.
[23:45.910 --> 23:46.790]  That happened to me
[23:46.790 --> 23:48.890]  the other day. I was playing and I was
[23:48.890 --> 23:50.870]  like in a mountain and then all of a sudden
[23:50.870 --> 23:53.030]  like just getting hurt by nothing
[23:53.030 --> 23:54.750]  and then died and then I went back
[23:54.750 --> 23:57.010]  and it happened again and I went, uh, it's a ghost I guess.
[23:57.650 --> 23:59.030]  Hey Geoff, that's me.
[23:59.270 --> 24:00.070]  Watch this drive.
[24:01.190 --> 24:02.090]  Where are you? Okay.
[24:06.190 --> 24:07.250]  We'll fucking do it.
[24:09.030 --> 24:09.550]  Four...
[24:21.220 --> 24:22.260]  Oh man.
[24:22.980 --> 24:24.180]  We're fucking stupid.
[24:26.460 --> 24:28.180]  It's just the dumbest people.
[24:28.420 --> 24:28.820]  I love it.
[24:30.080 --> 24:31.600]  Oh, Eric's doing finger guns.
[24:31.880 --> 24:32.740]  Oh, what's going on, Eric?
[24:34.260 --> 24:36.140]  Shut up! Alexa, shut up!
[24:36.560 --> 24:37.500]  Shut up, Mark!
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.080]  Oh, God.
[24:44.340 --> 24:46.360]  I hate it when I buy shit and there's Alexa
[24:46.360 --> 24:47.380]  like built into it.
[24:47.760 --> 24:50.220]  My freaking sound bar
[24:50.220 --> 24:51.060]  is listening to me.
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.300]  Alright, we're almost there, I think.
[24:53.300 --> 24:54.520]  While you're listening to it.
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.080]  It's like, how do you like it, dickhead?
[24:58.240 --> 24:59.780]  Uh, yeah, directly north from here.
[25:00.480 --> 25:01.220]  What is this?
[25:01.440 --> 25:02.120]  Is this another vault?
[25:03.080 --> 25:05.160]  Looks like a vault. Vault 51.
[25:05.160 --> 25:05.300]  Vault 51.
[25:07.760 --> 25:08.380]  This says,
[25:08.780 --> 25:09.900]  visit claim center.
[25:10.540 --> 25:11.820]  I guess I want to do this?
[25:12.860 --> 25:14.040]  I'm entering as the team leader.
[25:14.860 --> 25:16.240]  You're filing a claim?
[25:16.880 --> 25:17.520]  I guess so.
[25:19.680 --> 25:20.900]  What the fuck? Really?
[25:21.400 --> 25:22.300]  What is this?
[25:22.880 --> 25:24.560]  I don't think I've done this. Home expansion?
[25:25.480 --> 25:26.800]  I just discovered this.
[25:28.800 --> 25:30.280]  Where did you go? In the vault?
[25:30.660 --> 25:32.720]  Yeah, no, no, no, I'm in the claim center thing
[25:32.720 --> 25:33.440]  I'm going off to the left.
[25:34.220 --> 25:35.840]  Oh, and find out where the key unlocks place?
[25:36.280 --> 25:38.440]  Oh, I think this is probably
[25:38.440 --> 25:40.340]  just where you come to get the plans
[25:40.340 --> 25:41.740]  for your own vault, maybe?
[25:43.640 --> 25:44.460]  I just got them from
[25:44.460 --> 25:46.900]  my friends, but maybe that's what this is?
[25:47.520 --> 25:48.580]  This is just story.
[25:49.020 --> 25:50.140]  Boo! Story!
[25:50.520 --> 25:50.680]  Boo!
[25:52.160 --> 25:53.980]  Um, alright, where's this guy?
[25:54.000 --> 25:55.980]  I gotta talk to this fucking robot again and then I think I'm done.
[25:59.260 --> 25:59.620]  Great.
[26:00.800 --> 26:01.200]  Uh,
[26:01.920 --> 26:03.620]  there's nothing else that I need.
[26:04.980 --> 26:05.180]  Cool.
[26:05.500 --> 26:07.060]  Alright, I did whatever home expansion is.
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.900]  Oh, is this a repair
[26:09.900 --> 26:11.000]  hole? Modify repair.
[26:13.360 --> 26:13.760]  Combine
[26:13.760 --> 26:14.700]  some guns, I guess.
[26:16.640 --> 26:17.700]  Uh, I am
[26:17.700 --> 26:19.780]  all done here, but you guys keep repairing stuff. Do your stuff.
[26:20.180 --> 26:21.580]  Oh, you need to use repair kits?
[26:21.780 --> 26:22.920]  You can't just combine stuff?
[26:22.920 --> 26:25.460]  You can, but you need
[26:25.460 --> 26:27.260]  the pieces and parts. It tells you
[26:28.140 --> 26:29.280]  what things you need.
[26:30.380 --> 26:31.480]  It's always adhesive.
[26:32.660 --> 26:33.520]  Screws and adhesive.
[26:37.510 --> 26:39.330]  And if you have trouble finding that stuff in the wild,
[26:39.450 --> 26:40.870]  you can buy it at the
[26:41.350 --> 26:43.270]  train stations. Most likely.
[26:44.050 --> 26:44.390]  Grenades?
[26:45.110 --> 26:45.530]  Why?
[26:47.630 --> 26:49.370]  I still gotta kill that gang leader.
[26:49.550 --> 26:50.970]  That's so funny. Are you serious?
[26:52.110 --> 26:53.150]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[26:53.410 --> 26:54.030]  I'll do it never.
[26:55.570 --> 26:57.550]  I'll be level 500 before I ever do it.
[26:58.210 --> 26:58.730]  Whoa!
[27:00.070 --> 27:01.130]  Where'd that come from?
[27:02.010 --> 27:02.670]  Green stuff.
[27:03.630 --> 27:05.390]  A grenade popped. Eric, was that you?
[27:06.010 --> 27:07.630]  No. A bunch of green stuff
[27:07.630 --> 27:10.050]  happened. We can go to...
[27:10.050 --> 27:11.310]  Okay, here's what I
[27:11.310 --> 27:12.290]  think we can do.
[27:13.890 --> 27:14.410]  Whoops.
[27:15.510 --> 27:17.370]  Let me see. What do you think we can do?
[27:17.830 --> 27:18.970]  I think...
[27:21.050 --> 27:22.090]  we can...
[27:22.090 --> 27:23.630]  open the water valve
[27:23.630 --> 27:25.490]  at Wavy Willard's water part.
[27:25.490 --> 27:27.270]  It is just east of here,
[27:27.370 --> 27:29.510]  and it's the giant alligator
[27:29.510 --> 27:30.950]  thing, and
[27:31.490 --> 27:32.490]  it's a quest that I need.
[27:33.290 --> 27:34.690]  I also need to do that.
[27:35.090 --> 27:37.510]  I still have find out what the
[27:37.510 --> 27:39.190]  key unlocks, so I guess I'll be coming back here,
[27:39.270 --> 27:40.450]  because whatever I do...
[27:43.670 --> 27:45.270]  It's like a lot of multiplayer
[27:45.270 --> 27:47.950]  games. You're only doing the quests for the
[27:47.950 --> 27:49.610]  team leader.
[27:49.990 --> 27:51.310]  It would just make sense if everyone could
[27:51.310 --> 27:52.930]  just do everything that they're nearby.
[27:52.930 --> 27:54.090]  I totally agree.
[27:54.390 --> 27:55.150]  I totally agree.
[27:56.510 --> 27:58.710]  If we all have the quest, it seems like we should
[27:58.710 --> 27:59.710]  all be able to do the quest.
[28:00.510 --> 28:02.450]  I also don't like the team leader
[28:02.450 --> 28:04.610]  system, where the leader is
[28:04.610 --> 28:06.790]  the person who the box
[28:06.790 --> 28:08.630]  is checking for. That doesn't make sense.
[28:11.110 --> 28:12.490]  What are the benefits of being a
[28:12.490 --> 28:13.510]  true leader, Eric?
[28:15.170 --> 28:16.530]  Think about how many sacrifices
[28:16.530 --> 28:18.530]  a leader has to make in their lives.
[28:18.630 --> 28:20.270]  You figure there's got to be some sort of a benefit.
[28:20.270 --> 28:21.950]  I'm waiting to see.
[28:22.070 --> 28:23.010]  Maybe one day.
[28:24.770 --> 28:26.490]  Which X-Men do you think we all are?
[28:32.650 --> 28:33.990]  Yeah, I'm pretty smart.
[28:35.150 --> 28:36.230]  We need to head
[28:36.930 --> 28:38.290]  south and east
[28:38.290 --> 28:38.830]  from here.
[28:40.330 --> 28:42.210]  Eric seems like a night crawler to me.
[28:42.430 --> 28:44.010]  Nah, I'm Cyclops.
[28:44.110 --> 28:44.650]  It's so easy.
[28:46.970 --> 28:48.410]  Everybody thinks he's Cyclops.
[28:48.410 --> 28:50.070]  There's no second thought about that.
[28:50.190 --> 28:51.870]  The man has two eyes. Doesn't make any sense.
[28:54.910 --> 28:56.410]  Put a bit of gaffer down the front
[28:56.410 --> 28:58.390]  of his thing and then he doesn't have to be called
[28:58.390 --> 29:00.290]  Cyclops. What do they call him then? Twoclops?
[29:00.370 --> 29:01.050]  Doesn't make any sense.
[29:01.750 --> 29:03.690]  Oh, here comes Biclops.
[29:04.310 --> 29:06.350]  Can it be anybody in the Xbox universe?
[29:06.750 --> 29:08.550]  Anybody in the Xbox universe?
[29:09.110 --> 29:10.130]  I'm Master Chief.
[29:11.150 --> 29:11.930]  I'm uh...
[29:13.710 --> 29:14.250]  I'll be
[29:14.250 --> 29:14.910]  Mosquitio.
[29:16.350 --> 29:16.830]  I'm
[29:16.830 --> 29:18.790]  probably Jamie Madrix, the
[29:18.790 --> 29:19.570]  multiple man.
[29:21.130 --> 29:22.090]  Good pick.
[29:22.830 --> 29:24.130]  Thank you, Deep Cut.
[29:24.910 --> 29:26.830]  He was funny. He was the funniest member
[29:26.830 --> 29:28.650]  of X Factor. Can I set
[29:28.650 --> 29:31.410]  waypoints? Simon Cowell?
[29:31.930 --> 29:32.290]  Yes.
[29:32.910 --> 29:33.870]  Can I set...
[29:33.870 --> 29:34.690]  I don't wanna die.
[29:36.290 --> 29:38.750]  I wanna set a waypoint to be like, hey, I wanna go over
[29:38.750 --> 29:40.810]  to this house
[29:40.810 --> 29:42.730]  that's just south of where I am.
[29:42.730 --> 29:44.450]  But I don't know how to make that easy to
[29:44.450 --> 29:46.870]  understand for you guys. Like, you see it
[29:46.870 --> 29:48.830]  clearly now, but if we were all split
[29:48.830 --> 29:50.790]  up, I don't know how I would communicate that.
[29:51.470 --> 29:52.350]  I feel like maybe
[29:52.710 --> 29:54.330]  we got a bunch of bad guys over here.
[29:55.530 --> 29:58.230]  Oh, Eric's on fire.
[29:59.010 --> 30:00.390]  It happens. Oh, that guy's dead.
[30:01.350 --> 30:02.590]  This Eric's on fire.
[30:03.050 --> 30:04.550]  Oh man, there's like a bunch of guys over here.
[30:04.730 --> 30:06.110]  I didn't know what we were getting into, I guess.
[30:10.190 --> 30:10.510]  Guys
[30:10.510 --> 30:12.830]  coming from the east.
[30:13.990 --> 30:14.670]  Is it a job
[30:14.670 --> 30:16.070]  for a shotgun or for QWELM?
[30:17.110 --> 30:17.510]  QWELM.
[30:20.810 --> 30:22.290]  Always a job for QWELM.
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.640]  Cleansy Manor.
[30:28.980 --> 30:30.920]  Too many people in this fucking cult, bro.
[30:31.280 --> 30:32.140]  Oh, I see him.
[30:32.840 --> 30:34.380]  Got him. Oh, he's going.
[30:34.600 --> 30:36.160]  He's falling. He fell.
[30:37.160 --> 30:37.700]  Oh, oh.
[30:38.700 --> 30:39.320]  Hey, what's up guys?
[30:41.060 --> 30:41.500]  Discover
[30:41.500 --> 30:42.880]  Cleansy Manor, that's cool.
[30:43.420 --> 30:43.860]  Whoa.
[30:46.080 --> 30:46.800]  Cleansy Manor.
[30:47.060 --> 30:48.980]  Oh no.
[30:49.160 --> 30:51.280]  Wow, oh no. Time has not been good.
[30:51.480 --> 30:53.300]  We got a...
[30:53.300 --> 30:54.360]  guys around the front now.
[30:57.640 --> 30:59.320]  Do you remember when there were all kinds of awesome
[30:59.320 --> 31:00.580]  Tom Clancy games all the time?
[31:00.980 --> 31:03.680]  Yeah. We really took that era for granted.
[31:05.720 --> 31:06.580]  Now they're like
[31:07.160 --> 31:08.300]  Fuck Terrence Turton.
[31:08.420 --> 31:09.000]  Fuck you.
[31:09.680 --> 31:12.580]  I had a friend who misread the
[31:12.580 --> 31:14.520]  box as Tom Claney
[31:14.520 --> 31:16.600]  and he refused
[31:16.600 --> 31:17.840]  to ever learn that it was Clancy.
[31:18.120 --> 31:20.140]  He was calling him Tom Claney for the rest of his life.
[31:20.860 --> 31:22.460]  That's not a friend.
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.480]  Got guys around the front
[31:26.480 --> 31:28.960]  up the side. I just ran out of...
[31:28.960 --> 31:29.760]  Up the duff.
[31:31.480 --> 31:31.960]  Preggers.
[31:32.540 --> 31:32.940]  Oh.
[31:34.060 --> 31:34.640]  How'd you do?
[31:35.840 --> 31:36.200]  Tied.
[31:37.000 --> 31:37.880]  Oh what? Are you dead?
[31:38.580 --> 31:39.480]  Let me get you up.
[31:40.520 --> 31:41.240]  Dead dead.
[31:42.600 --> 31:43.540]  Dead dead redemption.
[31:45.880 --> 31:46.740]  Where are you?
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.440]  What the fuck? I'm getting shot from behind?
[31:48.720 --> 31:49.980]  Where are these guys? Oh there we go.
[31:50.960 --> 31:52.500]  I'm coming, I'm coming. I got you.
[31:53.640 --> 31:54.520]  I mean I'm fine.
[31:54.780 --> 31:54.920]  Okay.
[31:56.720 --> 31:58.360]  Have you seen their front door?
[32:00.420 --> 32:00.960]  That's like a
[32:00.960 --> 32:02.700]  giant scary skull with red eyes.
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.380]  Says there's a nuke.
[32:05.220 --> 32:06.420]  Oh my god!
[32:06.780 --> 32:07.840]  We need to get out of here.
[32:08.340 --> 32:08.920]  What do you mean?
[32:10.660 --> 32:12.800]  There's a nuke that's about to come down on us.
[32:13.440 --> 32:14.680]  Right down on us?
[32:14.860 --> 32:16.160]  Yes. We need to go east.
[32:16.760 --> 32:17.460]  Just go east.
[32:18.100 --> 32:19.500]  Get on the road and go east.
[32:21.180 --> 32:22.800]  Just get on the road and go east.
[32:23.120 --> 32:24.080]  Did we do this?
[32:24.200 --> 32:25.000]  What we came here for?
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.400]  I mean we killed people but that's not what we were coming here for.
[32:27.500 --> 32:28.140]  I just wanted to go there.
[32:28.140 --> 32:30.020]  Yeah this wasn't the mission we were just going through.
[32:31.700 --> 32:33.100]  Get up here and stay on the road.
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.420]  Can I hold a marshmallow
[32:35.420 --> 32:37.260]  and see if it gets cooked by this nuke?
[32:37.780 --> 32:39.000]  It'll definitely get cooked.
[32:40.240 --> 32:41.520]  How far away do we have to be?
[32:42.440 --> 32:42.980]  If you
[32:42.980 --> 32:44.820]  press start you can see what the
[32:45.440 --> 32:46.140]  radius is.
[32:48.460 --> 32:49.180]  Oh shit!
[32:49.420 --> 32:50.560]  Yeah we got a whole ass.
[32:50.680 --> 32:52.980]  That's why I keep telling you guys to get on the road and head east.
[32:52.980 --> 32:54.700]  Oh you weren't joking.
[32:54.960 --> 32:55.940]  No I don't. I
[32:56.740 --> 32:57.820]  rarely do.
[32:58.940 --> 33:00.580]  When was the last time you heard Eric make a joke?
[33:00.900 --> 33:02.960]  Especially with something
[33:02.960 --> 33:04.220]  like this. This is it man.
[33:04.940 --> 33:06.880]  You don't joke around about
[33:06.880 --> 33:08.540]  nuclear war guys.
[33:09.200 --> 33:10.820]  Oh shit we got scorched right here?
[33:10.980 --> 33:11.280]  Fuck.
[33:13.080 --> 33:14.580]  Okay there we go.
[33:15.480 --> 33:17.080]  Scorched officer too so we probably
[33:17.080 --> 33:19.140]  get the silo code.
[33:20.700 --> 33:21.500]  Trapped in their
[33:22.040 --> 33:23.740]  scorched bodies not wanting to...
[33:24.820 --> 33:25.720]  Okay so are we
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.960]  outside of the... yeah we're out.
[33:27.440 --> 33:28.360]  So can we just watch?
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.920]  Here let's kick around hemlock holes here.
[33:32.300 --> 33:33.800]  Let's kill
[33:33.800 --> 33:35.240]  whatever's in here and then we can watch.
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.800]  What if you all stand outside the
[33:37.800 --> 33:39.920]  circle and I just step in and see what happens?
[33:40.700 --> 33:41.880]  You can definitely do that
[33:41.880 --> 33:43.840]  if you like. Okay I see Gavin
[33:43.840 --> 33:46.000]  and I see Nick. I see you guys separated
[33:46.000 --> 33:47.660]  by a tree. It's weird to have nine
[33:47.660 --> 33:49.360]  seconds of life left.
[33:49.620 --> 33:51.560]  This is exciting. This is like the end of Star Trek
[33:51.560 --> 33:53.620]  whatever. Two, three. This is going to make this whole video
[33:53.620 --> 33:55.420]  worth it. Alright Gavin Spock.
[33:55.660 --> 33:57.700]  Oh I survived. What do you mean? Did it go
[33:57.700 --> 33:59.720]  off? I didn't see anything.
[34:00.520 --> 34:00.660]  Where?
[34:02.400 --> 34:03.080]  Oh shit.
[34:04.400 --> 34:05.320]  I did.
[34:05.940 --> 34:06.400]  Wow!
[34:08.080 --> 34:09.680]  It was BatDog's
[34:09.680 --> 34:10.160]  nuke.
[34:12.380 --> 34:13.640]  He nuked us?
[34:15.020 --> 34:15.480]  Oh!
[34:17.620 --> 34:18.880]  Oh god!
[34:20.060 --> 34:21.520]  So he is in here.
[34:22.000 --> 34:22.660]  BatDog!
[34:25.160 --> 34:26.480]  What a twist!
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.520]  He is in here. He's all the
[34:31.520 --> 34:32.920]  way down to the southeast.
[34:32.920 --> 34:32.980]  What a twist!
[34:43.340 --> 34:44.060]  Wow!
[34:45.680 --> 34:47.240]  Don't go in there!
[34:49.560 --> 34:51.640]  Oh my god!
[34:54.010 --> 34:54.730]  God!
[34:55.030 --> 34:56.130]  That's crazy!
[34:57.630 --> 34:59.910]  That feels like a perfect place to end it.
[35:00.030 --> 35:01.210]  Jesus Christ!
[35:01.210 --> 35:02.490]  That was pretty cool.
[35:03.510 --> 35:04.830]  Holy shit. That was great.
[35:05.470 --> 35:07.610]  Wow! The size of that cloud.
[35:07.930 --> 35:08.970]  That's so cool.
[35:09.150 --> 35:11.170]  Isn't that awesome? I didn't know you could do that in this game.
[35:11.430 --> 35:12.910]  So how long is the area off limits?
[35:13.690 --> 35:14.490]  Great question.
[35:14.970 --> 35:17.050]  I think it's like a couple...
[35:17.050 --> 35:18.970]  like a few hours. Not like in-game hours.
[35:19.090 --> 35:20.630]  Like hours, hours. But if you guys go in there,
[35:20.810 --> 35:22.930]  it is radiation crazy.
[35:23.730 --> 35:24.730]  Oh 59 rats!
[35:25.250 --> 35:25.650]  Jesus!
[35:27.110 --> 35:27.510]  Dude.
[35:27.510 --> 35:27.710]  Dude.
[35:29.270 --> 35:29.710]  Wow.
[35:31.730 --> 35:33.750]  What did it look like when I died?
[35:33.890 --> 35:34.330]  Did it look cool?
[35:34.970 --> 35:36.710]  No. It just dropped.
[35:37.130 --> 35:39.290]  It was just a huge explosion. You fell over
[35:39.290 --> 35:40.790]  and there's a huge mushroom cloud.
[35:41.470 --> 35:43.370]  The mushroom cloud looked cool as fuck, I thought.
[35:43.670 --> 35:45.450]  Yeah, I think that might be it.
[35:46.130 --> 35:46.910]  Well guys,
[35:47.650 --> 35:49.450]  we're learning how to play Fallout 76
[35:49.450 --> 35:51.550]  as a team and what it makes for
[35:51.550 --> 35:53.530]  videos. If this is something you like,
[35:53.630 --> 35:55.650]  let us know. If this is something you didn't like
[35:55.650 --> 35:58.010]  but you have an idea about what might help us
[35:58.010 --> 35:59.750]  that would also help as well.

[36:09.190 --> 36:10.630]  Wait, we should all do that.
[36:11.810 --> 36:13.610]  We should all do that one.
[36:15.010 --> 36:15.910]  That's how I felt
[36:15.910 --> 36:17.290]  doing this video.
