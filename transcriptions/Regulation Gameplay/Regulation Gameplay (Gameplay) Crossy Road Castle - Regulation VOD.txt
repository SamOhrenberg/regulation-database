[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  Let's play this game!
[00:02.280 --> 00:05.320]  I've never played this. I've played proper cross-heroes. We're gonna figure out how this works.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.700]  Because of Nick's butt should be our next t-shirt. Oh, I got achievement.
[00:09.920 --> 00:15.220]  Oh, so did I! Did I win? Holy shit. That was easy. Better with friends! If you've just joined us,
[00:15.420 --> 00:17.260]  I'm the chicken, Andrew's the cat,
[00:18.820 --> 00:24.760]  and what are you, Geoff? A duck? I'm a fucking duck, dude! I'm the most ducky duck you've ever seen. What are you talking about?
[00:24.760 --> 00:31.530]  Oh, shit, okay. Okay, so are the coins important?
[00:32.810 --> 00:40.470]  I assume so. You use them to buy shit. Currency and like hats and stuff. So it's shared coinage. Oh, then yeah, they're...
[00:41.750 --> 00:42.910]  Oh, shit, they're ennies.
[00:45.290 --> 00:48.750]  This is just a tutorial we're doing right now.
[00:49.390 --> 00:50.430]  It would have to be, yeah.
[00:51.970 --> 00:53.090]  I want to kill this guy.
[00:57.250 --> 01:04.250]  Bam! I like how... I didn't have the ability to... No! Duck down! Get him! Chicken down!
[01:04.470 --> 01:08.390]  Ah, you can't do it now. How do you bring a chicken back from the dead? It's hard to do.
[01:09.270 --> 01:11.690]  It requires dark magic, Gavin.
[01:13.450 --> 01:15.710]  I like the recent streams sound like
[01:17.110 --> 01:22.150]  2004. Like we're going backwards very quickly as a company.
[01:24.110 --> 01:26.390]  Oh, Andrew's head came off. That would imply we went forward.
[01:27.950 --> 01:35.750]  Okay, I like how classy we all chose to be with our top hats. Oh, absolutely. Dude, maybe we're the top hat crew.
[01:36.170 --> 01:36.850]  I think we are.
[01:40.530 --> 01:45.850]  And Eric and Nick are the battery crew. Oh, we don't have... They're battery buddies.
[01:49.070 --> 01:53.630]  Oh, shit. I'm getting achievements left and right, son. Oh, look at all these people.
[01:55.430 --> 01:57.850]  Somebody killed me. What happened? Kill, kill, kill.
[01:59.570 --> 02:00.290]  What happened to you?
[02:01.610 --> 02:04.630]  Chicken down. I got it, guys. Don't worry. Get through. Don't worry.
[02:06.930 --> 02:08.490]  Okay, I was worried you wouldn't come back.
[02:12.030 --> 02:14.870]  Oh, I'm so sorry, Geoff. You killed me. I'm so sorry.
[02:16.090 --> 02:16.530]  Oh, spikes!
[02:22.370 --> 02:26.150]  So everyone has to live. Dangerous standing around here.
[02:27.850 --> 02:32.870]  Oh, what does the T do? I don't know. It's testosterone. I'm jacked.
[02:33.830 --> 02:35.110]  Did you guys leave? Okay.
[02:36.090 --> 02:37.810]  Because there's a button up there I don't want to press.
[02:38.570 --> 02:40.310]  Probably would have killed us. Oh, shit. Yeah.
[02:42.730 --> 02:43.610]  Nice stomp.
[02:45.230 --> 02:46.610]  Oh, it's gonna...
[02:46.610 --> 02:48.370]  Oh, good reset. Good reset.
[02:48.770 --> 02:50.190]  Good reset.
[02:50.530 --> 02:51.130]  No!
[02:52.390 --> 02:53.670]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[02:54.310 --> 02:55.650]  Don't suck me in!
[02:56.150 --> 02:56.590]  No!
[02:58.530 --> 02:59.110]  Woo!
[02:59.850 --> 03:01.190]  Oh my god.
[03:02.430 --> 03:04.050]  What does that do?
[03:04.230 --> 03:05.130]  You're our only hope.
[03:06.210 --> 03:06.770]  I got it.
[03:08.310 --> 03:09.550]  Gavin is chicken.
[03:10.370 --> 03:11.510]  Andrew is cat.
[03:12.050 --> 03:13.010]  Geoff is duck.
[03:13.010 --> 03:15.150]  Oh, I fucking suck. I'm a sucky duck.
[03:15.650 --> 03:16.790]  I'm a dead duck right now.
[03:16.910 --> 03:18.630]  Oh no, I need to jump on that pigeon.
[03:21.270 --> 03:22.430]  Oh, how did he not die?
[03:22.710 --> 03:24.150]  Good move.
[03:24.250 --> 03:27.230]  Dude, these castles are a piece of piss.
[03:27.890 --> 03:28.290]  No!
[03:30.790 --> 03:31.870]  Geoff, it's all on you!
[03:33.070 --> 03:33.470]  Jesus.
[03:34.130 --> 03:35.650]  They're walking on the buttons, it's chaos.
[03:38.370 --> 03:39.650]  You little assholes!
[03:40.130 --> 03:41.110]  Alright, here we go.
[03:43.370 --> 03:44.110]  Hit the button!
[03:44.990 --> 03:45.670]  Hit the button!
[03:46.970 --> 03:47.330]  Nice.
[03:48.070 --> 03:49.090]  I'm hitting it, I'm hitting it.
[03:49.190 --> 03:52.670]  Oh shit, I didn't want to hit that one.
[03:53.450 --> 03:53.810]  No!
[03:55.030 --> 03:55.810]  You guys got sucked.
[03:58.430 --> 03:59.670]  What do we do with them?
[03:59.790 --> 04:00.350]  We got a hundred.
[04:00.670 --> 04:01.950]  We got a boss fight coming up.
[04:02.110 --> 04:02.650]  Ten more rooms.
[04:03.210 --> 04:05.550]  Ten rooms to boss? Okay.
[04:05.550 --> 04:07.190]  We're gonna jump up to the bosses.
[04:07.350 --> 04:08.130]  Oh, give me the tea!
[04:12.210 --> 04:13.250]  Holy shit!
[04:13.550 --> 04:15.590]  Dig Reaper with the 25 subs!
[04:16.510 --> 04:18.290]  Oh, thank you so much, Reaper!
[04:18.750 --> 04:20.470]  Dig Reaper, thank you so much.
[04:20.590 --> 04:21.430]  The coins!
[04:21.930 --> 04:24.010]  25 subs, that's a lot of digging and a lot of reaping.
[04:24.310 --> 04:24.370]  That's insane.
[04:25.730 --> 04:29.410]  And I believe that, uh...
[04:29.410 --> 04:31.130]  There were another ten earlier, but
[04:31.130 --> 04:32.730]  it was chaos.
[04:33.490 --> 04:34.690]  Oh, thank you so much.
[04:34.830 --> 04:36.430]  It really means a lot to us.
[04:42.280 --> 04:43.700]  I can just see
[04:44.120 --> 04:46.600]  a little pop hat pop in the frame.
[04:51.140 --> 04:52.600]  To those coming in
[04:52.600 --> 04:54.640]  assuming the audio isn't that bad,
[04:54.920 --> 04:55.860]  yeah, you're wrong.
[04:59.000 --> 04:59.960]  It's gonna get
[05:00.660 --> 05:02.660]  dramatically better when you watch the vibe.
[05:03.860 --> 05:04.560]  Wait, why do you
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.400]  sound so quiet, Al?
[05:06.900 --> 05:07.380]  Who?
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.060]  Who sounds quiet?
[05:10.420 --> 05:11.060]  Oh, everyone.
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.020]  Everything sounds the exact same to me.
[05:16.160 --> 05:17.200]  Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about, Gavin.
[05:17.400 --> 05:19.380]  I think your headset just sucks, Gavin.
[05:19.920 --> 05:20.880]  My headset's ass.
[05:24.860 --> 05:26.720]  Is it doing like a dynamic
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.580]  decision-making
[05:28.580 --> 05:30.120]  thing? I don't know, but
[05:30.120 --> 05:32.400]  I think your headset is so nice
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.260]  that it's bad, or just is terrible.
[05:34.580 --> 05:35.860]  What do you mean it's nice that it's bad?
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.320]  Like it's trying to do fancy
[05:38.320 --> 05:40.460]  features that are actually just not good.
[05:41.660 --> 05:42.400]  So what's
[05:42.400 --> 05:44.660]  everybody doing this weekend, Andrew? You got any plans?
[05:46.600 --> 05:47.820]  Andrew, turn down the sound.
[05:49.020 --> 05:49.800]  What'd you say?
[05:50.820 --> 05:51.300]  Surviving.
[05:52.080 --> 05:54.000]  That's my weekend plans.
[05:54.200 --> 05:55.380]  How about you?
[05:56.720 --> 05:57.940]  Uh, yeah, surviving.
[05:58.840 --> 05:59.440]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[05:59.440 --> 06:01.400]  I'd like to not have to talk
[06:01.400 --> 06:03.480]  to American Express for a couple hours
[06:05.000 --> 06:05.800]  on Saturdays.
[06:05.800 --> 06:06.040]  Woo!
[06:08.540 --> 06:09.540]  Gotta get that tea!
[06:09.820 --> 06:11.440]  My cousin's having a Christmas party
[06:11.440 --> 06:11.900]  I'll go to.
[06:12.700 --> 06:15.100]  Oh, that's awesome! Before you go in, turn
[06:15.100 --> 06:16.240]  game sound down a bit.
[06:17.360 --> 06:17.580]  Okay.
[06:20.460 --> 06:21.440]  Oh, here's our boss
[06:21.440 --> 06:22.680]  fighting an eagle. Oh, shit.
[06:24.240 --> 06:25.400]  Hey, Gavin, what are you doing
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.420]  this weekend? Just kidding, nobody cares.
[06:26.420 --> 06:27.280]  There we go.
[06:28.580 --> 06:29.600]  What are we doing?
[06:30.400 --> 06:31.800]  No, I care! Oh, that's the flip.
[06:32.020 --> 06:32.600]  They'll kill you.
[06:33.420 --> 06:36.260]  It was like, either we need those or we don't.
[06:36.300 --> 06:37.640]  Those are not power-ups.
[06:38.420 --> 06:39.440]  Okay, we just gotta hit him.
[06:40.620 --> 06:41.160]  Watch the egg!
[06:41.860 --> 06:42.100]  Shit.
[06:44.060 --> 06:45.660]  Thanks for the $25 gift to SubSiby.
[06:46.960 --> 06:48.440]  What are you doing this weekend, Gavin?
[06:48.440 --> 06:48.940]  Do you have any plans?
[06:51.620 --> 06:52.000]  Um...
[06:52.420 --> 06:54.380]  I'm just gonna catch up on work.
[06:54.380 --> 06:55.200]  Been out of the country.
[06:55.880 --> 06:57.680]  Yeah. Did you have a good trip?
[06:58.600 --> 06:58.880]  Yeah!
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.520]  No, you killed it!
[07:02.260 --> 07:03.760]  Hell yeah! Fuck you!
[07:03.880 --> 07:04.760]  I think I'm gonna see Wicked.
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.140]  Oh, nice! Have you ever seen the play?
[07:08.820 --> 07:10.000]  Nah, I don't know anything about it.
[07:10.860 --> 07:11.140]  Me neither.
[07:16.720 --> 07:17.700]  Oh, we got cannons!
[07:18.480 --> 07:19.180]  Oh, hell yeah!
[07:20.240 --> 07:21.360]  Oh, fuck! I missed!
[07:21.780 --> 07:22.040]  Oh!
[07:25.040 --> 07:26.420]  Donkey Kong flashbacks!
[07:28.440 --> 07:30.020]  Oh, God. Don't remind me.
[07:31.240 --> 07:32.240]  Oh, that game.
[07:33.140 --> 07:33.860]  Oh, nice!
[07:34.500 --> 07:34.860]  Yeah!
[07:38.590 --> 07:40.470]  Where do we get to spend all this testosterone?
[07:42.070 --> 07:43.290]  I don't know.
[07:44.250 --> 07:45.690]  Did you change the audio yet?
[07:46.730 --> 07:47.170]  Yeah, I did.
[07:47.390 --> 07:47.590]  Nice.
[07:48.770 --> 07:49.330]  Oh!
[07:54.630 --> 07:58.050]  Aw, damn it!
[07:58.590 --> 08:00.770]  Hell yes. That was awesome.
[08:01.970 --> 08:02.150]  Bah!
[08:06.990 --> 08:07.910]  Oh, shit!
[08:08.490 --> 08:09.310]  Oh, shit!
[08:10.490 --> 08:10.790]  Okay.
[08:11.770 --> 08:12.330]  Ow.
[08:14.270 --> 08:14.830]  Ow.
[08:16.530 --> 08:17.790]  You son of a bitch!
[08:18.490 --> 08:18.670]  Oh!
[08:18.910 --> 08:21.130]  Oh, you killed me!
[08:21.630 --> 08:22.090]  I'm dead!
[08:24.870 --> 08:25.430]  Uh...
[08:25.430 --> 08:27.250]  Okay, am I gonna get sucked through?
[08:28.350 --> 08:29.390]  I think you will, yeah.
[08:29.670 --> 08:30.450]  A little suckage.
[08:32.590 --> 08:33.150]  Woo!
[08:34.330 --> 08:35.710]  Okay, good shot across.
[08:37.270 --> 08:37.770]  Testosterone!
[08:37.790 --> 08:39.730]  Oh, it was worth it.
[08:39.930 --> 08:41.030]  T for the team!
[08:42.250 --> 08:45.450]  Yeah, what if they're team points?
[08:46.170 --> 08:46.290]  Ow.
[08:47.490 --> 08:47.670]  Oh.
[08:48.790 --> 08:48.970]  Huh!
[08:54.160 --> 08:56.620]  Had a pretty good week of content, I guess.
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.940]  Not so bad.
[08:58.280 --> 09:01.160]  We filmed two, I thought, great podcasts yesterday.
[09:02.320 --> 09:05.480]  I always enjoy the ones where we haven't spoken in a while.
[09:06.020 --> 09:06.420]  Yeah.
[09:07.520 --> 09:09.920]  That's why we did that in a gameplay,
[09:10.240 --> 09:12.700]  and I asked if we could do the podcast first,
[09:12.700 --> 09:15.080]  because I figured that'd be fun energy,
[09:15.140 --> 09:16.120]  because I always miss you guys
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.300]  when we go on a break like that.
[09:17.420 --> 09:18.680]  That's great thinking, Andrew.
[09:19.980 --> 09:20.720]  Uh, okay.
[09:20.960 --> 09:24.000]  We also did a gameplay yesterday that is a little special
[09:24.000 --> 09:24.960]  that I'm very excited about.
[09:26.640 --> 09:27.840]  Might actually release
[09:27.840 --> 09:28.640]  by the end of the year.
[09:29.220 --> 09:29.820]  Let's see.
[09:31.340 --> 09:33.200]  I don't know about y'all, but I just
[09:33.200 --> 09:34.460]  thoroughly enjoyed doing that.
[09:34.580 --> 09:35.700]  Oh, fuck.
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.220]  I've been enjoying the comments on ScootScoot,
[09:39.280 --> 09:40.180]  which came out today.
[09:40.420 --> 09:42.320]  Was it yesterday? I don't know.
[09:43.760 --> 09:44.880]  It's good vibes.
[09:45.860 --> 09:46.780]  What were you going to say, Andrew?
[09:47.900 --> 09:49.840]  I said I haven't looked at those yet.
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.220]  It was fun.
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.160]  That was a really fun video.
[09:54.160 --> 09:54.880]  I want these coins.
[09:55.420 --> 09:56.840]  We recorded that a long time ago, huh?
[09:58.240 --> 09:58.640]  Yeah.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.040]  How many
[10:02.040 --> 10:04.000]  GTA videos do you think you guys
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.080]  have recorded without me now?
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.800]  How many heists have we done?
[10:07.980 --> 10:08.560]  That haven't come out.
[10:08.740 --> 10:12.240]  Between the heists and stuff too, right?
[10:12.320 --> 10:14.280]  We only did one between the heists,
[10:14.320 --> 10:14.680]  I think.
[10:16.880 --> 10:18.060]  I don't remember what number
[10:18.060 --> 10:19.920]  heist. I think there's a...
[10:19.920 --> 10:22.200]  Is there 11 of them, Gavin, or is there more than that?
[10:22.760 --> 10:23.700]  I have no idea.
[10:26.920 --> 10:27.880]  How do we get on the...
[10:27.880 --> 10:28.660]  Here we go.
[10:30.940 --> 10:31.840]  Oh, shit!
[10:32.060 --> 10:32.500]  No!
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.520]  That's not at all
[10:35.520 --> 10:36.040]  what I wanted.
[10:36.120 --> 10:37.380]  I did the exact same thing.
[10:41.000 --> 10:41.440]  Ah!
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.620]  I'm scared!
[10:44.040 --> 10:44.520]  I'm scared!
[10:46.340 --> 10:46.780]  Okay.
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.580]  Oh, Jesus, I just missed.
[10:51.180 --> 10:52.180]  Oh, go, go, go!
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.000]  You're running out of time!
[10:53.920 --> 10:55.460]  Is that our first death?
[10:55.460 --> 10:56.880]  I think so.
[10:57.160 --> 10:58.240]  Yeah, okay.
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.180]  Don't stop!
[11:01.980 --> 11:02.960]  No, it's...
[11:02.960 --> 11:04.120]  The fart sounds.
[11:05.060 --> 11:06.220]  Geoff, it's all on you.
[11:07.840 --> 11:08.760]  We believe.
[11:09.380 --> 11:10.020]  We believe.
[11:10.260 --> 11:10.740]  No!
[11:11.940 --> 11:13.360]  I was so close!
[11:15.380 --> 11:16.640]  Let's top up our time.
[11:18.060 --> 11:18.940]  Go, go, go.
[11:19.800 --> 11:20.960]  I'm dead, but that's okay.
[11:21.040 --> 11:22.260]  There we go, you made it.
[11:23.320 --> 11:23.760]  Oh!
[11:25.040 --> 11:25.840]  You're a genius.
[11:26.200 --> 11:27.220]  That was really smart.
[11:28.620 --> 11:29.640]  I'm not used to being this smart.
[11:29.640 --> 11:32.360]  I didn't notice you did that.
[11:32.520 --> 11:34.560]  I was like, oh, wow, I did it way faster this time.
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.480]  It didn't even blink.
[11:37.220 --> 11:38.420]  It's just the speed of light.
[11:45.490 --> 11:46.370]  After all that.
[11:46.770 --> 11:48.430]  You did all the work.
[11:49.710 --> 11:50.530]  Ain't that the way.
[11:57.010 --> 11:58.170]  Jesus, it takes forever.
[11:59.790 --> 12:00.230]  Yeah.
[12:01.090 --> 12:02.610]  Are we all just...
[12:02.610 --> 12:04.670]  Refilling hearts from the vending machine.
[12:05.310 --> 12:05.890]  Seems like.
[12:05.950 --> 12:06.110]  Yeah.
[12:08.910 --> 12:10.210]  Oh, hey, what's the chat got going on?
[12:10.210 --> 12:11.010]  We got max hearts.
[12:13.310 --> 12:14.010]  Oh, achievement!
[12:14.910 --> 12:17.570]  Are we ever gonna play Cloudberry Kingdom together again?
[12:17.650 --> 12:18.350]  We've never played it together.
[12:18.630 --> 12:19.910]  I've never played Cloudberry Kingdom.
[12:20.270 --> 12:21.570]  Oh, yeah, we gotta get...
[12:21.570 --> 12:23.010]  We gotta get you in on Cloudberry.
[12:24.610 --> 12:27.190]  That might be tricky, because it's delisted now.
[12:27.190 --> 12:28.170]  I have it.
[12:28.210 --> 12:28.770]  Is that true?
[12:29.250 --> 12:32.390]  Well, the 360 store doesn't exist anymore.
[12:33.410 --> 12:35.570]  Unless you had previously bought it.
[12:35.930 --> 12:37.610]  I might have it.
[12:38.450 --> 12:39.330]  If you...
[12:39.330 --> 12:39.810]  It's possible.
[12:40.050 --> 12:42.090]  Sign in on an old Xbox I have.
[12:42.270 --> 12:43.050]  Where it's on it.
[12:43.130 --> 12:43.930]  Do you get to play it?
[12:45.250 --> 12:47.870]  I don't know the answer to that.
[12:48.390 --> 12:48.910]  Maybe.
[12:49.310 --> 12:51.170]  I'm not sure how licensing worked.
[12:52.450 --> 12:53.530]  On the 360.
[12:53.530 --> 12:55.170]  If Microsoft
[12:56.090 --> 12:57.650]  basically takes away a game
[12:57.650 --> 12:59.310]  I bought, can I get a refund?
[13:00.310 --> 13:00.570]  No.
[13:00.870 --> 13:03.610]  No, because it's in the... whatever.
[13:04.110 --> 13:05.850]  Oh, because I just licensed it.
[13:05.930 --> 13:06.690]  I never bought it.
[13:08.030 --> 13:09.290]  You don't buy shit anymore
[13:09.290 --> 13:09.910]  if you buy digitally.
[13:10.650 --> 13:12.850]  I'm a whole sore right bitchin' about this.
[13:15.370 --> 13:16.790]  Well, maybe they were licensing
[13:17.330 --> 13:19.710]  my Xbox Live money this whole time.
[13:19.890 --> 13:21.130]  It was just a license.
[13:22.270 --> 13:23.730]  Yeah, if you wrote the contract
[13:23.730 --> 13:24.430]  maybe you get away with that.
[13:25.110 --> 13:26.930]  Everything that I thought was going to be
[13:26.930 --> 13:28.890]  super cool in the 2000s
[13:28.890 --> 13:31.650]  like in 2002, the way the world was going to change
[13:31.650 --> 13:33.210]  turned out to be fucking lame
[13:33.210 --> 13:34.070]  and a rip off.
[13:36.670 --> 13:37.370]  It was all
[13:37.370 --> 13:39.330]  just a different way to grift our money
[13:39.330 --> 13:40.330]  in a different way.
[13:42.350 --> 13:43.390]  I'm mad about it.
[13:44.350 --> 13:44.890]  I do.
[13:45.010 --> 13:46.050]  I get fucking frustrated.
[13:47.810 --> 13:48.230]  What?
[13:50.450 --> 13:51.470]  I'm going to be there first.
[13:51.570 --> 13:52.650]  I'm going to get to the top first.
[13:53.730 --> 13:55.450]  Get the coins, I'm going to get there first.
[13:56.290 --> 13:57.010]  Oh, no.
[13:58.450 --> 13:59.270]  That dream's dead.
[13:59.610 --> 14:01.370]  Man, Mark the Frog says, I can't watch this.
[14:01.450 --> 14:02.590]  Then he left. Jesus.
[14:03.510 --> 14:04.930]  Is it because we're so good?
[14:06.450 --> 14:07.890]  Is it too...
[14:07.890 --> 14:09.370]  too chickeny?
[14:10.330 --> 14:11.490]  Or too ducky?
[14:12.890 --> 14:14.130]  Not enough cats
[14:14.130 --> 14:14.710]  with hats.
[14:14.930 --> 14:16.110]  Pretty duck heavy.
[14:20.610 --> 14:21.570]  Grab the tea!
[14:22.170 --> 14:23.750]  I'm suspicious of Mark
[14:23.750 --> 14:25.210]  because Eric really likes him.
[14:26.070 --> 14:28.130]  It's hard to trust
[14:28.130 --> 14:29.370]  things that Eric likes.
[14:29.770 --> 14:30.130]  It's true.
[14:30.850 --> 14:34.150]  Oh, he punched the anus of this bird again.
[14:36.270 --> 14:38.330]  Alright, if you die, you're a loser.
[14:39.610 --> 14:41.770]  It's like that game, right? Press Eric to doubt.
[14:43.010 --> 14:43.410]  Uh...
[14:43.810 --> 14:44.690]  I'm a loser.
[14:46.470 --> 14:47.370]  Ah, I died.
[14:47.650 --> 14:48.050]  Loser.
[14:51.550 --> 14:53.410]  You can do it, Andrew. You can hit his anus.
[14:53.870 --> 14:54.690]  Oh, no!
[14:54.850 --> 14:55.810]  He almost got egged.
[14:56.630 --> 14:58.090]  He's shitting eggs at me.
[14:58.550 --> 15:01.850]  I bet you could do a draft of bird bosses in video games.
[15:04.730 --> 15:05.130]  Probably.
[15:06.370 --> 15:07.170]  I mean...
[15:07.710 --> 15:09.310]  Which other ones come to mind for you right now?
[15:10.730 --> 15:11.250]  Uh...
[15:13.110 --> 15:14.550]  I swear, I fought...
[15:14.550 --> 15:17.590]  I must have fought like 18 birds in my life.
[15:18.970 --> 15:21.210]  There's probably some bird bosses in like
[15:21.210 --> 15:21.690]  The Witcher.
[15:22.870 --> 15:23.910]  Oh yeah, The Griffon.
[15:24.730 --> 15:26.650]  Probably some bird Final Fantasies.
[15:27.530 --> 15:28.630]  Oh yeah, there's a...
[15:28.630 --> 15:30.170]  That's the first boss you fight in The Witcher 3.
[15:31.250 --> 15:32.470]  Is The Griffon a bird?
[15:33.270 --> 15:33.830]  I think so.
[15:34.330 --> 15:34.550]  Yeah.
[15:34.550 --> 15:35.150]  Oh.
[15:36.450 --> 15:39.510]  I think if you've got like
[15:39.510 --> 15:41.310]  50% bird parts,
[15:41.370 --> 15:42.310]  you get to count as a bird.
[15:44.550 --> 15:46.490]  If it wasn't a bird, what would it?
[15:46.730 --> 15:48.550]  Like, Articuno is a bird boss.
[15:48.570 --> 15:48.950]  Shit.
[15:50.510 --> 15:51.470]  Who's Articuno?
[15:51.530 --> 15:51.930]  Is that a Pokemon?
[15:52.550 --> 15:55.110]  It's one of the legendary birds in Pokemon.
[15:56.430 --> 15:57.150]  There you go.
[15:58.110 --> 15:58.470]  Ah!
[15:59.850 --> 16:00.950]  I made it.
[16:04.200 --> 16:05.100]  Ah.
[16:05.840 --> 16:06.740]  Ah.
[16:07.600 --> 16:07.900]  Oh!
[16:08.440 --> 16:09.520]  Halfway to 501.
[16:10.580 --> 16:14.180]  I am terrified of whatever is happening with the floor.
[16:15.220 --> 16:15.440]  Oh!
[16:18.410 --> 16:19.940]  Yeah, it's getting bad.
[16:22.530 --> 16:22.980]  Oh!
[16:24.490 --> 16:24.940]  Nice!
[16:25.200 --> 16:27.920]  How do I...
[16:27.920 --> 16:28.960]  How do I do this?
[16:28.960 --> 16:31.160]  How do I live?
[16:31.700 --> 16:32.520]  You fight
[16:32.520 --> 16:34.720]  giant birds in Skyrim.
[16:35.080 --> 16:36.240]  They got scales and that.
[16:37.200 --> 16:37.780]  Breathe fire.
[16:38.100 --> 16:41.280]  Do you fight any birds in like Mega Man or Metroid?
[16:44.000 --> 16:44.960]  Bird man.
[16:45.880 --> 16:46.500]  You fight the MOA.
[16:47.440 --> 16:49.540]  Somebody said I kicked a MOA in Halo once.
[16:50.040 --> 16:50.720]  Oh yeah, you could.
[16:53.020 --> 16:54.360]  Slap the shit out of those birds.
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.120]  I made me laugh so hard I stopped playing.
[16:59.540 --> 17:00.000]  Ah!
[17:08.780 --> 17:10.560]  I guess there's a bird
[17:10.560 --> 17:11.840]  fight in Elden Ring.
[17:12.280 --> 17:13.000]  Oh, I should play again.
[17:15.720 --> 17:16.640]  Bird rights?
[17:16.840 --> 17:17.440]  Whatever that is.
[17:19.520 --> 17:20.240]  Goose game.
[17:23.280 --> 17:24.200]  Holy shit.
[17:24.700 --> 17:25.400]  This is a long level.
[17:25.880 --> 17:26.340]  I suck!
[17:30.020 --> 17:31.520]  I'm glad I didn't wait.
[17:33.160 --> 17:34.400]  I was gonna wait for you guys.
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.000]  No.
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.200]  Andrew, we still gotta do our technical
[17:38.200 --> 17:39.140]  difficulties video.
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.380]  Yeah, when is that happening?
[17:41.980 --> 17:44.400]  We were gonna do it, but Andrew had technical difficulties.
[17:45.340 --> 17:45.980]  I did.
[17:46.140 --> 17:47.140]  Yeah, but that was a while ago, right?
[17:48.740 --> 17:49.820]  It took me
[17:50.820 --> 17:52.420]  50 minutes today to try to
[17:52.420 --> 17:54.100]  change the Twitch name
[17:54.100 --> 17:56.560]  of the stream. And then I just gave up
[17:56.560 --> 17:58.360]  because I ran out of time and did it on my laptop.
[17:59.260 --> 18:00.060]  My desktop
[18:00.060 --> 18:02.260]  is so fucked. My old Mac.
[18:04.680 --> 18:05.240]  That's
[18:05.940 --> 18:06.500]  terrible.
[18:08.340 --> 18:10.280]  Just sitting there looking at spin
[18:10.280 --> 18:11.560]  wheels. Can we
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.660]  just buy you a new computer?
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.240]  Uh, we can't buy
[18:16.240 --> 18:17.140]  anything at the moment.
[18:21.420 --> 18:21.980]  So...
[18:21.980 --> 18:24.280]  No! Oh, I saw that
[18:24.280 --> 18:26.280]  your federal government said they
[18:26.280 --> 18:27.600]  knocked the strike off today.
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.620]  Oh, they did? Yeah.
[18:29.920 --> 18:31.300]  Is that happening?
[18:32.000 --> 18:32.660]  Yeah, I don't know.
[18:32.780 --> 18:35.020]  I don't know what that means.
[18:35.160 --> 18:37.380]  I don't know if people are gonna be like, oh, okay, I didn't realize you were
[18:37.380 --> 18:38.980]  serious. They'll be like, hey, fuck you.
[18:39.100 --> 18:39.580]  How about that?
[18:41.980 --> 18:42.260]  No!
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.800]  Oh, holy shit!
[18:52.980 --> 18:53.960]  Get him, get him, get him.
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.460]  Finish him off.
[18:56.260 --> 18:57.280]  Did Geoff even come?
[18:58.240 --> 18:59.100]  Yeah, I
[18:59.100 --> 19:00.640]  fucking went through the door first.
[19:01.020 --> 19:03.140]  Oh, I thought you just stood at the beginning.
[19:03.700 --> 19:05.740]  Nah, I was just watching you guys be slow.
[19:07.360 --> 19:08.660]  Oh, the T!
[19:09.000 --> 19:09.700]  Ah, shit.
[19:10.760 --> 19:12.000]  We left T on the table.
[19:12.840 --> 19:14.740]  We left T on the table.
[19:17.540 --> 19:18.520]  Get that one.
[19:21.180 --> 19:22.560]  We don't. Yeah, we're good.
[19:25.560 --> 19:27.040]  Where the fuck...
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.680]  Speaking of good, we're pretty good
[19:28.680 --> 19:29.380]  at this game.
[19:30.340 --> 19:32.220]  We might be like, some of the best.
[19:34.020 --> 19:34.460]  Yeah?
[19:34.920 --> 19:35.580]  I'm thinking.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.780]  I just got an achievement, so I think you're right.
[19:38.740 --> 19:39.880]  I'm stuck in a hate loop.
[19:40.080 --> 19:40.680]  Oh, whoops.
[19:42.340 --> 19:43.440]  I know what that's like.
[19:48.160 --> 19:49.680]  Oh, this is... oh, okay.
[19:49.680 --> 19:51.360]  That was real satisfying.
[19:51.600 --> 19:52.920]  That felt real good.
[19:56.740 --> 19:58.320]  I like these cannons a lot.
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.320]  Yeah, the cannons are...
[19:59.320 --> 19:59.760]  Big fan of them.
[20:00.800 --> 20:01.780]  Cannons are pure fun.
[20:02.700 --> 20:05.540]  How did you do that, Andrew, without...
[20:05.540 --> 20:07.320]  I just waited a second.
[20:07.620 --> 20:08.800]  Oh, patience.
[20:09.960 --> 20:10.420]  I hate it.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.640]  I waited a second too much.
[20:17.840 --> 20:19.820]  Is Cloudberry Kingdom a fun game,
[20:19.820 --> 20:21.000]  Gav? Is it like this?
[20:21.640 --> 20:24.160]  It's hell on earth, but it starts off quite nice.
[20:27.640 --> 20:29.140]  Didn't you guys...
[20:29.140 --> 20:30.280]  Didn't you guys do
[20:31.780 --> 20:32.560]  every level?
[20:33.860 --> 20:35.600]  We didn't finish, because I think
[20:35.600 --> 20:37.100]  the end is completely impossible.
[20:38.540 --> 20:39.280]  That's a bummer.
[20:40.060 --> 20:41.480]  And then I think we were going to stream it
[20:41.480 --> 20:43.060]  until we beat it, and then
[20:43.740 --> 20:45.960]  the stream just ended after like an hour
[20:45.960 --> 20:48.200]  instead, and I was very confused by it.
[20:48.200 --> 20:48.860]  Oh!
[20:49.380 --> 20:50.580]  Sounds like Achievement Hunter.
[20:53.900 --> 20:56.200]  Seems like a lot of build-up for a...
[20:58.220 --> 20:59.420]  A pretty flat ending.
[20:59.420 --> 21:00.060]  Oh, nice!
[21:02.380 --> 21:04.160]  I don't know who shot across,
[21:04.280 --> 21:04.640]  but that was awesome.
[21:04.660 --> 21:06.740]  You could just describe the company that way.
[21:08.760 --> 21:10.340]  A lot of build-up for a flat
[21:10.340 --> 21:10.600]  ending.
[21:22.920 --> 21:23.400]  Cool.
[21:27.220 --> 21:27.640]  No!
[21:28.260 --> 21:29.540]  I think we're about to face the eagle.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.040]  Third time.
[21:32.580 --> 21:34.400]  Can we kill this fucking thing permanently?
[21:35.220 --> 21:35.740]  Let's do it.
[21:36.460 --> 21:37.660]  Let's get rid of this thing.
[21:39.180 --> 21:40.900]  I'm yet to touch the eagle.
[21:41.920 --> 21:42.080]  Same.
[21:42.520 --> 21:42.940]  Really?
[21:44.080 --> 21:46.000]  You got it this time, I believe in you.
[21:46.100 --> 21:47.100]  I'm just going to do what you do.
[21:48.920 --> 21:50.300]  What the fuck?
[21:52.240 --> 21:53.680]  What is that ball?
[21:53.680 --> 21:54.400]  Oh!
[21:56.120 --> 21:57.120]  Jesus Christ.
[22:00.720 --> 22:01.780]  It's so hard.
[22:01.900 --> 22:02.820]  I don't know how you keep doing it.
[22:03.480 --> 22:04.560]  This is no good.
[22:04.680 --> 22:06.040]  This is no good.
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.740]  This takes an Andrew to do, god damn.
[22:09.040 --> 22:10.000]  This is no good.
[22:10.400 --> 22:12.380]  It's like when he was soloing the Destiny raids.
[22:12.520 --> 22:12.960]  Look at this.
[22:14.920 --> 22:16.160]  Soloing Sam the Eagle?
[22:16.500 --> 22:18.240]  Yeah, I got this.
[22:18.360 --> 22:20.420]  Hit him with your Fjallhorn or whatever.
[22:20.940 --> 22:23.320]  It got a lot easier after the first one.
[22:23.740 --> 22:25.080]  That first one sucked.
[22:25.740 --> 22:26.540]  Give me the coins.
[22:27.360 --> 22:28.680]  Oh, and there's so much tea.
[22:28.900 --> 22:29.820]  Look at all this tea.
[22:29.960 --> 22:30.700]  Oh, shit.
[22:36.000 --> 22:37.400]  It's a fucking idiot.
[22:40.240 --> 22:41.540]  We're all dumb.
[22:42.580 --> 22:43.360]  Let's do this.
[22:43.960 --> 22:44.200]  Alright.
[22:47.400 --> 22:48.340]  That's really hard.
[22:48.340 --> 22:51.660]  You seemed genuinely surprised by that death.
[22:51.920 --> 22:52.800]  Yeah, I was.
[22:56.760 --> 22:58.200]  Get to the fucking door.
[23:06.640 --> 23:07.780]  Geoff, it's all on you.
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.400]  Geoff's done his learning.
[23:09.820 --> 23:10.840]  No, Geoff!
[23:12.280 --> 23:13.360]  What was that?
[23:14.220 --> 23:16.280]  That was me fucking me-ing it.
[23:16.460 --> 23:17.400]  What do you mean, what was that?
[23:18.020 --> 23:18.500]  No!
[23:18.880 --> 23:19.400]  What was that?
[23:22.020 --> 23:22.780]  Oh, is that it?
[23:22.780 --> 23:23.620]  Oh, we're out.
[23:23.940 --> 23:25.580]  Is it 5-0-1?
[23:26.380 --> 23:28.660]  Fuck! How is it only 4-30?
[23:28.780 --> 23:30.180]  We didn't start till 4-30.
[23:30.700 --> 23:32.760]  We gotta do better than that somehow.
[23:33.660 --> 23:34.800]  Am I stuck in a time loop?
[23:34.820 --> 23:35.920]  Is it really only 4-30?
[23:36.040 --> 23:41.240]  That's the longest 15 minutes of my life.
[23:43.700 --> 23:44.940]  Alright, we can beat that.
[23:45.160 --> 23:45.840]  That'd be easy.
[23:47.480 --> 23:48.920]  We're still getting points, though.
[23:49.360 --> 23:50.160]  How high do we get?
[23:51.160 --> 23:52.500]  I mean, we're in space.
[23:53.020 --> 23:54.540]  Oh, yeah, and then...
[23:54.540 --> 23:56.620]  Did we just forget to buy lives that last time?
[23:57.220 --> 23:58.340]  No, we just died
[23:58.340 --> 24:00.080]  three times each.
[24:00.960 --> 24:01.960]  Yeah, we just sucked.
[24:02.280 --> 24:02.940]  Holy shit.
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.460]  Oh, I got a new hat from a duck.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.380]  I'm using my T.
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.540]  I was the fastest player.
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.340]  I'm spending 50 T's.
[24:11.480 --> 24:12.860]  Oh, I got a unihorse.
[24:15.400 --> 24:16.200]  Do we try again,
[24:16.240 --> 24:17.300]  or do you want to go to a different level?
[24:18.160 --> 24:19.180]  I think we should probably
[24:19.180 --> 24:20.020]  do a different level, right?
[24:20.340 --> 24:21.600]  Yeah, I would agree.
[24:23.000 --> 24:23.980]  Oh, what did I get?
[24:24.140 --> 24:26.540]  Oh, okay, nevermind.
[24:26.840 --> 24:29.440]  When you're done, return to lobby for us.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.780]  I accidentally changed to a horse.
[24:33.340 --> 24:34.780]  You both did. Look at you two.
[24:35.200 --> 24:35.760]  Little twins.
[24:37.600 --> 24:38.980]  I don't want to be the horse.
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.040]  Well, change it.
[24:42.800 --> 24:44.280]  Am I stuck as an horse?
[24:47.300 --> 24:48.280]  How do I change back?
[24:49.340 --> 24:50.780]  Click your guy.
[24:51.200 --> 24:52.260]  Yeah, click on it.
[24:52.580 --> 24:53.260]  Click your name.
[24:56.140 --> 24:56.580]  Oh.
[24:56.740 --> 24:57.580]  Then you can swap characters.
[24:57.720 --> 24:58.200]  There you go.
[25:01.320 --> 25:02.620]  I was doing it in the menu,
[25:02.720 --> 25:04.400]  and it wasn't doing it.
[25:09.570 --> 25:10.690]  Hey, I'm the chicken.
[25:13.790 --> 25:14.750]  There's no coins.
[25:15.710 --> 25:16.470]  Here we go.
[25:17.070 --> 25:17.590]  Bomb.
[25:19.670 --> 25:20.110]  Oh, look.
[25:20.270 --> 25:21.270]  It's you. I'm famous.
[25:22.570 --> 25:23.610]  Holy shit.
[25:26.070 --> 25:28.050]  What does this do? Oh, it's a fuse.
[25:28.310 --> 25:30.490]  Go, go, go. Run, run.
[25:35.700 --> 25:36.540]  Oh my god.
[25:39.280 --> 25:40.320]  Mission impossible.
[25:41.360 --> 25:42.360]  Oh, it's not.
[25:43.300 --> 25:44.720]  I fell. I died.
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.800]  Well, that's where I went.
[25:48.600 --> 25:49.740]  We've got to stay on it longer.
[25:50.920 --> 25:51.360]  Okay.
[25:57.150 --> 25:57.970]  Stick with it.
[25:58.070 --> 25:59.250]  Stick with it. Wait.
[26:02.610 --> 26:03.050]  Okay.
[26:03.730 --> 26:05.850]  I can't believe that killed us last time.
[26:05.950 --> 26:06.650]  That was so easy.
[26:09.110 --> 26:10.490]  I can't believe that it's...
[26:10.490 --> 26:10.810]  Oh, no.
[26:13.950 --> 26:15.030]  Hey, there's me. I'm a duck.
[26:16.790 --> 26:18.610]  I can't believe that if we die three times,
[26:18.650 --> 26:19.250]  it's all over.
[26:22.750 --> 26:23.630]  What the fuck?
[26:23.830 --> 26:24.930]  What the fuck?
[26:25.310 --> 26:27.070]  Were we supposed to use that to light the fuse?
[26:27.290 --> 26:29.190]  Oh, no. Okay, it's back. It's back.
[26:29.870 --> 26:31.290]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[26:32.470 --> 26:32.870]  Well...
[26:33.470 --> 26:35.030]  I think I've got to... You've got to time it.
[26:35.230 --> 26:37.010]  I think I've got to... That's it.
[26:37.170 --> 26:39.370]  Wrong way. Oh, that's the wrong way. Wrong way.
[26:44.180 --> 26:45.040]  There we go.
[26:46.200 --> 26:47.380]  Very good. Yeah.
[26:50.180 --> 26:51.760]  Go. Go. Go.
[26:52.180 --> 26:52.640]  Go. Go.
[26:57.780 --> 26:59.180]  Oh, good job, Geoff.
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.940]  This seems way harder than the last level.
[27:02.180 --> 27:03.100]  So much harder.
[27:04.820 --> 27:07.500]  I just get all panicky when I see the screen shake
[27:07.500 --> 27:08.600]  and things are breaking.
[27:08.900 --> 27:10.140]  Oh, it's coming down!
[27:10.460 --> 27:12.160]  Where are we going? Where are we going?
[27:17.140 --> 27:17.620]  Okay.
[27:25.400 --> 27:26.400]  Give me one of them hearts.
[27:29.820 --> 27:31.600]  Where did we get to last time? Level 90.
[27:32.340 --> 27:33.540]  Man, I looked over at the...
[27:33.540 --> 27:35.680]  I looked over at the chat for a second
[27:35.680 --> 27:37.660]  and they're talking about cooking down beef fat.
[27:38.660 --> 27:38.880]  Oh.
[27:39.460 --> 27:41.380]  What the hell is going on over there?
[27:45.830 --> 27:47.130]  What's the latest on beef?
[27:49.690 --> 27:50.570]  It's expensive.
[27:51.870 --> 27:52.750]  It's pricey.
[27:54.530 --> 27:55.350]  What's the crown?
[27:55.790 --> 27:57.350]  This might kill me. Sure did.
[27:57.730 --> 27:59.150]  That's just sure did. It's graffiti.
[28:00.210 --> 28:01.710]  Yeah, I learned that the hard way.
[28:01.930 --> 28:03.250]  I got real excited about it.
[28:06.150 --> 28:07.310]  I thought maybe it would be
[28:07.310 --> 28:08.890]  a nice little secret crown down there.
[28:09.850 --> 28:10.730]  Would you rather eat a...
[28:10.730 --> 28:13.490]  Would you rather eat a horse, duck, or a chicken?
[28:13.650 --> 28:14.790]  I guess I'd rather eat a chicken
[28:14.790 --> 28:16.530]  because I had some for lunch.
[28:19.850 --> 28:21.050]  Duck's good, though. I mean, I feel like
[28:21.050 --> 28:22.690]  in North America, at least. Duck's okay.
[28:22.690 --> 28:24.930]  Not a big duck fan. On a rare occasion.
[28:26.810 --> 28:27.850]  A little rich.
[28:28.470 --> 28:30.310]  I like those crispy duck pancakes.
[28:32.230 --> 28:33.870]  What are crispy duck pancakes?
[28:34.590 --> 28:36.130]  It's like little wraps that you make.
[28:37.070 --> 28:38.290]  Get it from a Chinese.
[28:46.390 --> 28:48.790]  Like a restaurant, you mean?
[28:48.910 --> 28:49.150]  Yeah.
[28:50.030 --> 28:50.630]  Okay.
[28:51.690 --> 28:52.470]  Was that unclear?
[28:54.250 --> 28:55.370]  No, not entirely.
[28:55.890 --> 28:58.590]  Oh, shit!
[29:03.840 --> 29:04.320]  Keep up, losers.
[29:09.020 --> 29:10.720]  Man, the upper deck is speedy.
[29:17.070 --> 29:19.330]  I'm worried about what the boss is going to look like for this.
[29:19.550 --> 29:20.250]  Whenever we get there.
[29:20.970 --> 29:22.270]  I am terrified.
[29:24.010 --> 29:24.870]  Keep up, loser.
[29:24.870 --> 29:24.910]  Keep up, loser.
[29:25.610 --> 29:26.550]  I'm trying.
[29:28.370 --> 29:29.930]  I'm too busy down here losing.
[29:34.050 --> 29:36.230]  Oh, look at that textbook. Look at this.
[29:38.310 --> 29:38.910]  Alright.
[29:39.710 --> 29:41.010]  We got one life.
[29:43.410 --> 29:44.550]  Let's not lose it.
[29:44.590 --> 29:45.330]  Everyone be sensible.
[29:47.690 --> 29:47.930]  Nope.
[29:49.670 --> 29:50.590]  Will not.
[29:54.440 --> 29:55.040]  Okay.
[29:56.100 --> 29:57.080]  There's no rush.
[29:57.300 --> 29:59.620]  Nothing's happening that means you need to rush.
[30:00.940 --> 30:03.320]  Yeah, being so sensible, it's insane.
[30:06.320 --> 30:06.920]  Wild.
[30:07.200 --> 30:07.400]  Wild!
[30:17.380 --> 30:19.380]  I don't know what I'm doing!
[30:19.600 --> 30:20.920]  I don't know what I'm doing!
[30:21.080 --> 30:21.600]  You gotta commit!
[30:22.540 --> 30:23.640]  I'm so scared!
[30:24.100 --> 30:25.440]  Alright, you've got three lives.
[30:29.740 --> 30:30.100]  Woo!
[30:30.520 --> 30:31.140]  You did it.
[30:32.660 --> 30:33.800]  You son of a bitch.
[30:34.620 --> 30:36.160]  Let's buy some hearts.
[30:38.080 --> 30:38.960]  Get all of them.
[30:43.330 --> 30:44.390]  Can we get like...
[30:44.390 --> 30:45.410]  They need to give us more.
[30:45.830 --> 30:46.670]  I don't like three.
[30:47.190 --> 30:48.770]  How do we level up our character?
[30:49.430 --> 30:52.390]  Whenever we're at one, just pretend you got three and then you'll relax.
[30:52.530 --> 30:52.650]  Okay.
[30:54.290 --> 30:55.070]  Start doing that.
[30:55.870 --> 30:58.450]  And maybe when we're at three, we should pretend we got one so we don't lose any.
[31:00.510 --> 31:00.990]  Ah!
[31:02.750 --> 31:03.230]  No!
[31:05.630 --> 31:06.410]  God damn it.
[31:06.990 --> 31:08.370]  That was what we weren't supposed to do.
[31:08.790 --> 31:10.670]  So how often can you buy a heart?
[31:10.750 --> 31:12.030]  Is it every ten or every five?
[31:12.150 --> 31:14.090]  I think every ten.
[31:15.210 --> 31:15.690]  Damn.
[31:15.970 --> 31:16.910]  I'm gonna go on the left.
[31:19.690 --> 31:20.890]  Maximize the coinage.
[31:21.470 --> 31:22.190]  Good coinage.
[31:24.750 --> 31:26.330]  Okay, we just gotta go nine more.
[31:26.810 --> 31:28.230]  Without losing lives.
[31:29.230 --> 31:30.610]  Come on.
[31:31.190 --> 31:31.910]  Oh!
[31:32.510 --> 31:34.450]  Just fucking suck.
[31:35.410 --> 31:35.990]  Oh!
[31:37.130 --> 31:38.450]  Holy shit!
[31:39.010 --> 31:39.870]  Great job, horse.
[31:40.030 --> 31:41.670]  That was absolutely amazing.
[31:41.790 --> 31:42.330]  Oh my god!
[31:44.110 --> 31:45.990]  I can't believe I made that.
[31:46.350 --> 31:46.670]  Okay.
[31:52.510 --> 31:53.490]  I mean...
[31:53.490 --> 31:55.650]  I'm shitting myself over here.
[31:56.550 --> 31:57.450]  Yeah, I'm shit also.
[31:58.830 --> 32:00.170]  Oh, it's speeding up.
[32:01.250 --> 32:01.850]  Okay.
[32:02.690 --> 32:03.570]  Get real good.
[32:06.790 --> 32:08.350]  Look at that!
[32:12.140 --> 32:13.300]  Oh shit!
[32:14.300 --> 32:15.180]  This is...
[32:15.180 --> 32:15.960]  I don't know when we go.
[32:17.900 --> 32:19.060]  You're good, you're good, you're good.
[32:19.460 --> 32:19.640]  Ah!
[32:20.460 --> 32:21.600]  Oh my god.
[32:22.080 --> 32:22.400]  Okay.
[32:24.280 --> 32:26.580]  If I look at the time, is it still gonna be 437?
[32:27.620 --> 32:28.220]  No.
[32:29.280 --> 32:30.080]  Before 38.
[32:30.080 --> 32:32.280]  I mean, if you were gonna be stuck in a time loop though...
[32:33.140 --> 32:34.160]  I can think of worse ones.
[32:34.280 --> 32:34.880]  Oh shit!
[32:36.400 --> 32:36.860]  446.
[32:37.980 --> 32:39.580]  Time's still moving. Time still exists.
[32:41.500 --> 32:42.940]  And the next will force...
[32:42.940 --> 32:43.280]  Oh!
[32:44.440 --> 32:44.760]  Oh!
[32:46.160 --> 32:47.500]  Oops. Don't do that.
[32:48.000 --> 32:48.780]  Don't do that.
[32:50.300 --> 32:50.740]  Oh!
[32:53.180 --> 32:54.360]  You do it!
[32:54.800 --> 32:55.080]  Oh!
[32:55.940 --> 32:57.280]  Thank god. Thank you.
[32:57.280 --> 32:57.840]  Oh!
[33:00.480 --> 33:01.360]  Someone yelling,
[33:01.480 --> 33:02.220]  did you do it?
[33:05.180 --> 33:07.540]  The platforms were freaking out.
[33:07.680 --> 33:08.700]  I'm sorry.
[33:09.200 --> 33:10.940]  That's okay. We made it. We made it. We're fine.
[33:11.600 --> 33:13.160]  Alright, we can almost buy our heart back.
[33:14.460 --> 33:15.160]  Keep moving.
[33:20.610 --> 33:21.490]  Keep moving?
[33:21.990 --> 33:23.530]  And you just ran off the side.
[33:23.530 --> 33:23.790]  Oh!
[33:25.490 --> 33:25.970]  Oh!
[33:32.460 --> 33:34.440]  I think after we're done, we should
[33:34.440 --> 33:36.300]  force Eric and Nick into this time loop.
[33:36.640 --> 33:38.060]  Oh god. Yeah, absolutely.
[33:38.440 --> 33:39.020]  No kidding.
[33:39.980 --> 33:41.220]  Let's get some lives, eh?
[33:45.600 --> 33:46.440]  Fuck me.
[33:50.570 --> 33:52.870]  Oh, any thoughts on the...
[33:52.870 --> 33:54.690]  Zach Lee wants to know if there's any thoughts
[33:54.690 --> 33:56.710]  on McDonald's bringing the snack wrap
[33:56.710 --> 33:57.170]  back.
[33:58.170 --> 33:58.910]  Never left.
[33:58.910 --> 34:00.070]  I don't know what it is.
[34:00.810 --> 34:02.770]  So, it's a wrap.
[34:03.050 --> 34:04.090]  It's just a snack wrap.
[34:04.750 --> 34:05.890]  What's in it? Is this a boss?
[34:07.170 --> 34:08.710]  It's chicken. It's like different
[34:08.710 --> 34:10.870]  types of... you do like a chicken and bacon
[34:11.670 --> 34:12.930]  type thing. I like chicken
[34:12.930 --> 34:14.690]  and bacon. Is it like in a tortilla?
[34:15.270 --> 34:16.850]  Or is it a pita? Yeah, it's just rolled up.
[34:17.050 --> 34:18.790]  It's a tortilla. Oh, we have to crash
[34:18.790 --> 34:19.770]  the fuses into it.
[34:20.810 --> 34:21.070]  Okay.
[34:25.120 --> 34:26.460]  Oh shit. Oh!
[34:27.020 --> 34:28.360]  Jesus! Oh no.
[34:28.360 --> 34:29.140]  Oh no.
[34:29.920 --> 34:31.280]  What am I gonna... Oh no!
[34:32.320 --> 34:33.080]  Oh shit!
[34:34.800 --> 34:35.600]  Oh no.
[34:36.040 --> 34:38.800]  Oh no. A lot of stuff has to go right.
[34:38.900 --> 34:40.240]  Fuses and then barriers.
[34:41.560 --> 34:42.540]  You gotta like knock it back?
[34:42.680 --> 34:43.900]  There you go. Yeah.
[34:46.920 --> 34:47.600]  Shit it out.
[34:48.800 --> 34:49.680]  Shit it out.
[34:50.880 --> 34:51.280]  Oops.
[34:52.140 --> 34:53.560]  Alright, you don't want to fall in too close.
[34:59.200 --> 34:59.680]  Go!
[34:59.960 --> 35:00.440]  Nice!
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.100]  So fuses come out of his mouth.
[35:06.460 --> 35:07.580]  Bombs come out of his butt.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.320]  I don't think the coins are worth it.
[35:09.340 --> 35:11.300]  I would just stay away from his asshole.
[35:12.040 --> 35:13.380]  I don't know if we could let
[35:13.380 --> 35:15.280]  Eric and Nick play this level.
[35:16.260 --> 35:17.220]  Ah, shit.
[35:17.700 --> 35:18.860]  Ah, he's just...
[35:18.860 --> 35:20.320]  He's shitting him in stupid places.
[35:21.680 --> 35:23.580]  It's gonna just encourage them
[35:23.580 --> 35:25.100]  to end up back in the emergency room.
[35:25.780 --> 35:26.380]  Haha.
[35:33.850 --> 35:35.370]  Alright, get ready for his gob.
[35:37.890 --> 35:38.490]  Nice!
[35:38.930 --> 35:39.530]  Nice!
[35:40.650 --> 35:43.470]  Oh, I'm not excited for him to escalate difficulty.
[35:43.870 --> 35:44.590]  That sucked.
[35:45.010 --> 35:46.070]  Just as it was.
[35:47.130 --> 35:48.230]  Let's get this heart back.
[35:52.780 --> 35:55.640]  Oh, nice tea you get.
[35:56.720 --> 35:57.060]  Yeah.
[35:58.580 --> 36:00.080]  Gotta get those teas.
[36:04.770 --> 36:05.530]  Oh.
[36:09.260 --> 36:10.020]  Oh.
[36:10.480 --> 36:10.740]  Ah.
[36:11.820 --> 36:12.680]  What the fuck?
[36:12.680 --> 36:13.520]  Is this good? Is it bad?
[36:20.320 --> 36:21.220]  Panic it.
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.360]  Oh, shit!
[36:28.560 --> 36:30.460]  Is this good?
[36:30.720 --> 36:31.340]  Is this bad?
[36:32.760 --> 36:33.920]  I'm freaking out.
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.660]  I'm freaking out.
[36:39.880 --> 36:40.600]  Oh, chief!
[36:40.800 --> 36:43.860]  Oh, we fucking annihilated them.
[36:45.980 --> 36:47.140]  Thanks for the easy ones.
[36:47.260 --> 36:49.740]  Oh, do I get in one of these cars?
[36:53.960 --> 36:54.960]  Good job, Geoff.
[36:57.220 --> 36:58.880]  Is he gonna swing the other way?
[36:58.960 --> 37:01.640]  Wait for it to swing the other way and just get crushed.
[37:02.500 --> 37:03.500]  Can I duck?
[37:04.080 --> 37:06.120]  Oh, I can walk under this thing?
[37:06.940 --> 37:07.620]  I mean, you are one.
[37:08.600 --> 37:09.360]  Oh, that's a good point.
[37:09.660 --> 37:12.160]  I hadn't considered that I wasn't the thing.
[37:13.200 --> 37:14.120]  I thought you just rolled.
[37:14.640 --> 37:16.020]  I thought you did that for a minute.
[37:16.120 --> 37:17.640]  I was like, wow, he failed the roll button.
[37:17.960 --> 37:18.160]  Yeah.
[37:18.900 --> 37:19.700]  Advanced tactics.
[37:24.080 --> 37:24.400]  Oh, no.
[37:31.260 --> 37:32.640]  Sometimes my fingers
[37:32.640 --> 37:34.360]  will go ahead and start going
[37:34.360 --> 37:36.760]  before my brain even acknowledges where I am.
[37:37.400 --> 37:38.320]  Oh, big time.
[37:41.400 --> 37:42.340]  Holy shit!
[37:43.100 --> 37:44.320]  Okay, the world
[37:44.320 --> 37:45.500]  is falling.
[37:47.520 --> 37:48.820]  Would you rather the world
[37:48.820 --> 37:49.660]  fall or the sky?
[37:51.200 --> 37:52.320]  The sky!
[37:56.680 --> 37:57.480]  Where are we going?
[37:58.400 --> 37:59.420]  He's getting the T.
[37:59.420 --> 37:59.480]  He's getting the T.
[38:12.390 --> 38:16.950]  You got this, Gavin!
[38:17.270 --> 38:17.950]  Are you both dead?
[38:18.790 --> 38:20.750]  No, I made it.
[38:22.410 --> 38:23.650]  Oh, come off it.
[38:24.390 --> 38:25.490]  Geoff killed me!
[38:26.830 --> 38:27.910]  Oh, friendly fire.
[38:29.170 --> 38:30.150]  It was a friendly fire.
[38:30.330 --> 38:30.910]  You got bombed.
[38:30.910 --> 38:31.930]  Don't walk into it, Geoff.
[38:32.070 --> 38:33.610]  You gotta jump on it.
[38:33.730 --> 38:34.290]  Oh, yeah.
[38:38.620 --> 38:39.420]  Aim better.
[38:40.460 --> 38:41.240]  Should I just go through the door?
[38:41.980 --> 38:42.300]  Oh, yeah.
[38:43.920 --> 38:45.280]  When did the door open?
[38:47.540 --> 38:48.940]  Oh, I just friendly fired you!
[38:49.460 --> 38:50.400]  I think I was already dead
[38:50.400 --> 38:50.920]  from burning.
[38:56.160 --> 38:56.560]  Damn!
[38:58.020 --> 38:58.420]  Suck!
[38:58.420 --> 38:58.460]  Suck!
[39:10.380 --> 39:12.780]  We're just completely ignoring...
[39:12.780 --> 39:14.580]  We're just getting the level clear.
[39:14.680 --> 39:15.680]  We got progress to make.
[39:15.960 --> 39:19.280]  The point of the game is to get to the door.
[39:22.220 --> 39:23.200]  I'll get rich
[39:23.200 --> 39:24.500]  off the endorsements after.
[39:24.780 --> 39:26.860]  I'll be on a Wheaties box. That's where I'll get my money.
[39:27.560 --> 39:28.580]  My Nike deal.
[39:29.200 --> 39:31.040]  And they won't remember you for hitting all the coins.
[39:31.780 --> 39:32.040]  Right.
[39:33.500 --> 39:34.540]  Oh, nice, Gavin.
[39:35.160 --> 39:37.520]  They're gonna remember me for opening doors
[39:37.520 --> 39:38.440]  and kicking pigeons.
[39:38.660 --> 39:38.860]  That's right.
[39:39.140 --> 39:39.820]  Take it off.
[39:43.580 --> 39:44.820]  Go, go, go, go!
[39:45.020 --> 39:46.460]  I'm gonna kick ass and take pigeons
[39:46.460 --> 39:47.320]  and I'm all out of pigeons.
[39:51.200 --> 39:51.500]  Oh!
[39:52.780 --> 39:54.420]  All three of us!
[39:55.140 --> 39:55.600]  Shit!
[39:55.900 --> 39:57.080]  That was awesome.
[40:00.260 --> 40:01.160]  Come on!
[40:10.380 --> 40:11.420]  Go for it!
[40:17.330 --> 40:19.130]  SonicCorp thinks that Canada has a way better
[40:19.130 --> 40:21.290]  menu at McDonald's than they do in the States.
[40:21.390 --> 40:23.030]  I feel like you agree with that, right, Andrew?
[40:23.070 --> 40:25.610]  You seem pretty pro-Canadian.
[40:26.270 --> 40:27.270]  Way more options.
[40:27.850 --> 40:29.070]  I'm gonna go to Canada
[40:29.070 --> 40:30.690]  and eat some of this trash.
[40:31.670 --> 40:32.470]  Oh, shit.
[40:32.550 --> 40:35.030]  We're probably gonna have to fly up to pay Andrew.
[40:35.950 --> 40:36.570]  Oh, no!
[40:38.030 --> 40:38.950]  Andrew, it's all you.
[40:39.170 --> 40:39.610]  Oh!
[40:44.700 --> 40:45.360]  Oh, no!
[40:45.460 --> 40:45.700]  No!
[40:46.680 --> 40:47.120]  No!
[40:48.800 --> 40:50.020]  God damn it.
[40:50.900 --> 40:53.320]  That stupid game won't let us start where we died.
[40:54.400 --> 40:55.500]  And it's not even 5-0-1.
[40:55.540 --> 40:56.280]  We gotta go again.
[40:57.120 --> 40:58.260]  Is there another level we can do?
[40:58.260 --> 40:59.380]  I can fast forward.
[41:02.980 --> 41:05.040]  We got a sticker? What does a sticker do?
[41:05.420 --> 41:07.120]  I just keep getting new hats.
[41:08.940 --> 41:10.080]  Can I put that sticker
[41:10.080 --> 41:10.940]  on my ass?
[41:11.080 --> 41:11.740]  Where do I put that?
[41:12.380 --> 41:13.920]  You put it in your sticker book.
[41:14.940 --> 41:15.260]  Oh.
[41:16.500 --> 41:18.700]  Yeah, you don't want it.
[41:19.120 --> 41:19.900]  It's for Nalami.
[41:22.320 --> 41:22.960]  Alright, so...
[41:22.960 --> 41:25.640]  Do you want to do new level or do you want to go back to the first one?
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.020]  To see if we can set a new record.
[41:27.020 --> 41:28.320]  Like a little bit of bird redemption?
[41:29.300 --> 41:31.060]  Yeah, some bird redemption for you guys.
[41:31.380 --> 41:33.300]  I predict we don't even make it
[41:33.300 --> 41:34.080]  as far as we did.
[41:34.900 --> 41:35.720]  Uh, agree.
[41:37.160 --> 41:37.820]  Let's do it.
[41:37.840 --> 41:39.340]  I think we can take that bird's anus
[41:40.140 --> 41:41.980]  out to the bins or whatever.
[41:42.080 --> 41:42.500]  What's it say?
[41:43.320 --> 41:45.140]  Take that bird's anus out to the bins.
[41:45.720 --> 41:46.900]  That's it. You got it.
[41:49.420 --> 41:50.760]  That anal binage
[41:50.760 --> 41:51.780]  is coming for that bird.
[41:54.560 --> 41:55.340]  You alright, Geoff?
[41:56.120 --> 41:57.460]  Yeah, I just...
[41:57.460 --> 41:59.540]  It's been a while since I've heard that classic phrase.
[42:00.880 --> 42:01.320]  Hahaha!
[42:04.180 --> 42:05.500]  I believe it was Churchill
[42:05.500 --> 42:06.140]  who said it.
[42:06.240 --> 42:09.520]  I like that this is just the same as if
[42:09.520 --> 42:10.960]  we were just playing offline together.
[42:11.960 --> 42:12.400]  Yeah.
[42:14.640 --> 42:16.020]  It pretty much, yeah.
[42:16.640 --> 42:17.780]  If you guys want to play video games
[42:17.780 --> 42:18.120]  with me.
[42:19.300 --> 42:19.380]  Woo!
[42:24.810 --> 42:25.870]  It's a pretty cute pig.
[42:27.310 --> 42:28.170]  I like it.
[42:28.410 --> 42:29.470]  Ah, shit. Okay.
[42:29.470 --> 42:29.570]  Alright.
[42:30.310 --> 42:33.090]  Oh, it got me!
[42:35.330 --> 42:35.610]  Ah!
[42:37.870 --> 42:39.070]  Go!
[42:40.970 --> 42:41.570]  You...
[42:42.090 --> 42:42.470]  Hahaha!
[42:43.090 --> 42:44.210]  Goddamn sausage!
[42:44.510 --> 42:45.090]  Hahaha!
[42:47.830 --> 42:48.310]  Hahaha!
[42:54.140 --> 42:54.900]  There you go!
[42:55.880 --> 42:57.540]  Oh, Gavin!
[42:59.160 --> 43:00.180]  Come on!
[43:00.180 --> 43:00.280]  Hahaha!
[43:03.060 --> 43:03.500]  Oh!
[43:06.620 --> 43:07.740]  I think
[43:07.740 --> 43:09.920]  if there was a version where everyone
[43:09.920 --> 43:11.940]  has to make it to the door to advance,
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.980]  do you think we'd get to level 10?
[43:15.180 --> 43:15.360]  No!
[43:20.760 --> 43:21.320]  Oh!
[43:27.510 --> 43:29.610]  Well, the good news is I've forgotten
[43:29.610 --> 43:31.770]  most of these levels, so it's almost feeling fresh.
[43:32.430 --> 43:32.990]  Absolutely.
[43:32.990 --> 43:34.950]  It's just so fat.
[43:35.090 --> 43:35.430]  Yeah?
[43:36.390 --> 43:38.530]  There you go.
[43:42.810 --> 43:44.310]  We did that last time.
[43:44.490 --> 43:45.270]  We got that one, huh?
[43:46.750 --> 43:48.310]  Ah! It came at an angle!
[43:48.830 --> 43:50.650]  Okay, guys, we've got one heart.
[43:51.910 --> 43:53.130]  Just jump it, jump it,
[43:53.210 --> 43:54.470]  jump it, jump it, jump it.
[43:57.550 --> 43:57.950]  Hahaha!
[43:57.950 --> 43:58.610]  Hahaha!
[43:59.910 --> 44:00.110]  Hahaha!
[44:01.930 --> 44:03.170]  Oh, thank God!
[44:06.950 --> 44:07.350]  Oh!
[44:08.470 --> 44:09.450]  Give me the heart!
[44:11.610 --> 44:12.750]  Give us another one!
[44:16.970 --> 44:17.730]  Alright, okay.
[44:18.110 --> 44:19.090]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[44:20.210 --> 44:21.910]  Hey, audience, do you guys like this game?
[44:22.050 --> 44:24.030]  Is this a fun game to watch? I haven't even, uh...
[44:24.690 --> 44:25.450]  I don't know.
[44:25.730 --> 44:26.970]  I can't really see the screen.
[44:27.630 --> 44:30.010]  I would assume not at all, but, um...
[44:30.530 --> 44:30.850]  Oh!
[44:34.910 --> 44:36.330]  Yeah, people say it's nice, lol.
[44:38.270 --> 44:40.070]  I like it. I'm having fun.
[44:40.130 --> 44:41.130]  Yeah, I'm having fun too.
[44:45.110 --> 44:45.750]  But, uh...
[44:46.150 --> 44:47.950]  Historically, me having fun seemed to be
[44:47.950 --> 44:50.250]  the opposite of what the Achievement Hunter audience wanted, so...
[44:51.590 --> 44:52.730]  I don't know, I never know if I can trust it.
[44:53.350 --> 44:54.150]  Well, I get it.
[44:54.630 --> 44:56.150]  You were having fun when you were playing
[44:56.150 --> 44:58.150]  the Wii U remote, and...
[44:58.150 --> 44:59.330]  lol
[45:00.910 --> 45:02.310]  And hitting stuff.
[45:03.170 --> 45:04.130]  That might be
[45:04.130 --> 45:05.910]  the most fun
[45:05.910 --> 45:07.930]  I have ever had in a video game.
[45:08.450 --> 45:10.190]  That was one of the few
[45:10.190 --> 45:12.330]  times where people would
[45:12.330 --> 45:13.850]  be mad beyond the video.
[45:14.630 --> 45:15.630]  Oh yeah, Michael was
[45:16.150 --> 45:16.930]  really upset.
[45:17.410 --> 45:19.770]  Which made it so much better for me.
[45:20.930 --> 45:22.450]  I got out of there like...
[45:22.850 --> 45:23.690]  Oh, that was...
[45:23.690 --> 45:24.810]  That was hell.
[45:24.810 --> 45:25.930]  But I wasn't...
[45:25.930 --> 45:28.430]  I wasn't genuinely angry.
[45:29.790 --> 45:31.230]  That makes one of us.
[45:35.430 --> 45:38.490]  Okay, just skate the middle.
[45:42.370 --> 45:44.970]  I just saw your duck
[45:44.970 --> 45:46.190]  fly into the frame.
[45:47.030 --> 45:48.010]  Corner of the screen.
[45:51.790 --> 45:52.610]  Look at all these funs.
[45:55.750 --> 45:57.310]  How much money do you have?
[45:58.650 --> 45:59.110]  1411.
[45:59.590 --> 46:01.230]  No, I got 2100.
[46:01.970 --> 46:03.310]  Nice. You been buying hats?
[46:04.570 --> 46:05.770]  Those things are 500 a pop.
[46:06.250 --> 46:07.110]  That's not enough hats.
[46:09.970 --> 46:10.430]  Frick!
[46:12.510 --> 46:13.210]  Buh buh buh buh buh!
[46:14.730 --> 46:15.830]  Buh buh buh buh buh buh!
[46:17.850 --> 46:18.590]  Let me in.
[46:21.210 --> 46:21.670]  Oh.
[46:22.310 --> 46:22.590]  Dammit.
[46:22.590 --> 46:24.230]  Not as clean as last time.
[46:27.130 --> 46:28.310]  I'm so happy to have my dishwasher
[46:28.310 --> 46:29.050]  fixed.
[46:29.890 --> 46:31.550]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[46:33.270 --> 46:33.890]  Good for you.
[46:34.030 --> 46:35.430]  I don't mind washing dishes.
[46:36.730 --> 46:37.970]  It's just so much more convenient.
[46:38.130 --> 46:39.690]  It sucks to do it above the dishwasher.
[46:42.770 --> 46:44.610]  I want to live in a world where
[46:45.070 --> 46:46.610]  I have two dishwashers.
[46:47.250 --> 46:47.990]  Yeah, I know.
[46:48.090 --> 46:49.130]  It's the fucking move.
[46:49.130 --> 46:50.250]  It's the dream.
[46:51.170 --> 46:53.370]  And then you just have kitchen cabinets
[46:53.370 --> 46:54.730]  that are the dishwasher.
[46:55.730 --> 46:55.930]  Yeah.
[47:03.940 --> 47:05.480]  He's trying to escape with us.
[47:05.820 --> 47:06.900]  Chromium Sulfate said
[47:06.900 --> 47:09.440]  I had two growing up. Damn, that must have been nice.
[47:09.720 --> 47:10.620]  Dude, what a life.
[47:11.700 --> 47:12.720]  Was that the best ever?
[47:13.240 --> 47:14.780]  I wouldn't grow up. I'd refuse.
[47:15.200 --> 47:16.740]  I'd be like, no, I've already hit. This is it.
[47:17.080 --> 47:17.940]  I would never move out.
[47:17.940 --> 47:20.760]  What if you did a Steve Jobs thing
[47:20.760 --> 47:21.960]  and was like, you actually have
[47:21.960 --> 47:24.320]  ten dishwashers as each of your fingers.
[47:25.880 --> 47:28.140]  Don't even need one. You forget two.
[47:28.340 --> 47:29.500]  Have you met my dad?
[47:32.900 --> 47:34.240]  You sound just like him.
[47:36.780 --> 47:37.520]  Ah, shit.
[47:43.620 --> 47:45.060]  501! Is that the iPad?
[47:46.200 --> 47:47.460]  501! We survived!
[47:48.300 --> 47:49.960]  Now let's kill this bird.
[47:49.960 --> 47:52.280]  We broke out of that 437 loop.
[47:55.020 --> 47:56.220]  We're now officially locked in.
[47:56.340 --> 47:57.060]  This is gonna be
[47:57.060 --> 47:58.500]  as far as we get
[47:59.900 --> 48:01.160]  on this one, what?
[48:01.400 --> 48:02.960]  On this attempt. Yeah.
[48:04.120 --> 48:05.120]  You got it.
[48:05.420 --> 48:07.460]  I'm determined to live through a bird
[48:07.980 --> 48:08.460]  level.
[48:09.520 --> 48:09.940]  I am too.
[48:11.940 --> 48:12.920]  Get it, bitch!
[48:13.660 --> 48:14.980]  There you go!
[48:16.080 --> 48:17.740]  I touched his brown eye.
[48:23.590 --> 48:24.030]  Ah!
[48:27.790 --> 48:28.230]  Beep!
[48:34.070 --> 48:34.910]  Holy shit.
[48:35.550 --> 48:37.990]  I thought you were leaving it real close there.
[48:40.070 --> 48:40.510]  Nice!
[48:42.110 --> 48:43.270]  Oh, we got all the coins.
[48:44.010 --> 48:45.510]  Woo! Great job, some of us!
[48:45.990 --> 48:47.030]  Alright! Yeah!
[48:52.580 --> 48:54.700]  Do we just go until we fail at this point?
[48:54.740 --> 48:55.380]  I guess we need to.
[48:55.860 --> 48:57.000]  Yeah, let's keep going.
[48:57.120 --> 48:57.920]  Let's try to set that record.
[48:59.140 --> 49:00.020]  No! Fuck!
[49:01.500 --> 49:02.480]  Alright. Is that where we were?
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.620]  Yeah, I think so.
[49:04.980 --> 49:05.800]  Somewhere around that.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.400]  Oh no! Oh no!
[49:11.760 --> 49:11.980]  Okay.
[49:13.780 --> 49:15.080]  We can speedrun this.
[49:16.060 --> 49:17.600]  Did anyone in chat have three dishwashers?
[49:20.760 --> 49:21.360]  That's the
[49:21.360 --> 49:22.620]  fucking dream right there.
[49:22.620 --> 49:24.860]  Better live it with two, like a pauper.
[49:25.360 --> 49:26.580]  How many plates
[49:26.580 --> 49:28.020]  would you have to require
[49:28.940 --> 49:29.900]  three dishwashers?
[49:30.220 --> 49:31.920]  At least three.
[49:32.720 --> 49:34.480]  But think about it, you could have one for mugs.
[49:34.800 --> 49:36.020]  You could have one for plates.
[49:37.040 --> 49:37.760]  Oh, that's insane.
[49:37.780 --> 49:39.080]  And everything would stack so nice.
[49:39.640 --> 49:41.920]  You could have your pots and pan washer.
[49:42.720 --> 49:43.040]  Yeah.
[49:43.820 --> 49:44.560]  Your cutlery.
[49:55.750 --> 49:57.230]  What's the most fun thing to
[49:57.230 --> 49:58.890]  empty when you're doing the dishwasher?
[50:04.010 --> 50:05.310]  I think silverware.
[50:05.450 --> 50:07.210]  I like emptying silverware if you can grab a bunch
[50:07.210 --> 50:08.450]  at once. I agree.
[50:08.990 --> 50:09.390]  Yeah.
[50:10.750 --> 50:12.090]  Get a handful of knives.
[50:21.030 --> 50:24.190]  Why do you think
[50:24.190 --> 50:25.750]  it's about a handful of knives, Andrew?
[50:26.890 --> 50:27.890]  Well, it's just, you know,
[50:27.930 --> 50:30.070]  it's dangerous. You're playing a dangerous game a little bit.
[50:30.210 --> 50:32.310]  Sometimes, depending on what angle
[50:32.310 --> 50:34.650]  or direction you point the cutlery.
[50:34.650 --> 50:35.450]  Yeah.
[50:36.990 --> 50:37.470]  Okay.
[50:40.270 --> 50:41.570]  Oh! What?
[50:42.670 --> 50:44.510]  Holy shit! You scared me, Gavin.
[50:44.770 --> 50:45.550]  Holy shit.
[50:46.750 --> 50:48.230]  Holy shit. You scared him, Gavin.
[50:48.850 --> 50:49.030]  Oh.
[50:50.610 --> 50:52.190]  I don't want to die here.
[50:52.710 --> 50:53.490]  I don't want to die.
[50:59.320 --> 51:01.020]  What do you think the world record is for how fast
[51:01.020 --> 51:02.420]  someone can run holding scissors?
[51:05.500 --> 51:06.380]  All? All?
[51:06.380 --> 51:06.460]  Yeah.
[51:08.180 --> 51:10.420]  I wouldn't think it would slow down your movement
[51:10.420 --> 51:11.880]  that much. Yeah, I think it'd be like
[51:11.880 --> 51:14.040]  whatever Usain Bolt wanted to do.
[51:17.200 --> 51:18.500]  What's the most urgent
[51:18.500 --> 51:20.160]  Usain Bolt needed to craft?
[51:20.640 --> 51:22.220]  Here's that. Here's one.
[51:22.820 --> 51:24.140]  Do you remember that dude
[51:24.140 --> 51:26.400]  a couple months ago who broke that
[51:26.400 --> 51:28.120]  world record running and then he, like,
[51:28.540 --> 51:30.400]  took his shoes off and dumped a bunch of nails
[51:30.400 --> 51:31.320]  out of the bottom of them?
[51:32.180 --> 51:34.040]  And he had, like, he had broken the record.
[51:34.040 --> 51:36.000]  Yeah, he had broken the record with nails
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.920]  in his shoes. Maybe
[51:37.920 --> 51:39.940]  you could do that with just a pair of scissors
[51:39.940 --> 51:41.400]  at the bottom. Fuck.
[51:44.100 --> 51:45.220]  That sounds terrible.
[51:45.960 --> 51:47.240]  Oh! Shit.
[51:47.720 --> 51:49.840]  Geoff, we gotta win. We gotta live for Andrew.
[51:52.160 --> 51:53.160]  Do it for the pig!
[51:54.120 --> 51:54.980]  Go, go, go, go, go!
[51:55.740 --> 51:57.800]  Yeah, we got this. Survive for the ham!
[51:58.100 --> 51:59.120]  There's bacon at stake.
[52:05.400 --> 52:07.140]  And just like that, we're back.
[52:23.330 --> 52:24.130]  Tea count!
[52:24.610 --> 52:26.870]  I mean, if you didn't get the tea...
[52:30.130 --> 52:30.990]  Oh, shit!
[52:31.230 --> 52:32.810]  I'd like to not die this time.
[52:44.780 --> 52:45.280]  Oh my god!
[52:45.360 --> 52:45.840]  You did it!
[52:46.880 --> 52:47.440]  Oh.
[52:49.520 --> 52:51.020]  Ah, missed the tea.
[52:53.320 --> 52:54.700]  No, it sounded like you said
[52:54.700 --> 52:55.260]  Mr. Tea.
[52:56.440 --> 52:57.480]  You'd be any good at this game.
[52:59.640 --> 53:00.200]  Whoa!
[53:02.860 --> 53:04.960]  Uh, I don't...
[53:04.960 --> 53:06.500]  He strikes me as a duck hunt guy.
[53:11.540 --> 53:13.540]  I bet he's old enough
[53:13.540 --> 53:14.460]  to be, like,
[53:15.320 --> 53:16.760]  video game enfeebled.
[53:20.560 --> 53:21.600]  I pity
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.460]  the fool that doesn't like Ms. Pac-Man.
[53:25.740 --> 53:27.360]  Was it possible to plug in
[53:27.360 --> 53:29.360]  multiple guns into
[53:29.360 --> 53:30.640]  the NES for Duck Hunt?
[53:34.680 --> 53:36.060]  I don't remember
[53:37.200 --> 53:38.740]  that being a thing.
[53:42.380 --> 53:43.420]  Was it...
[53:44.340 --> 53:46.080]  Duck Hunt or Punch-Out
[53:46.080 --> 53:48.760]  where it was realized that it was a multiplayer game?
[53:48.760 --> 53:49.620]  Oh!
[53:52.580 --> 53:53.020]  Really?
[53:53.740 --> 53:55.680]  I don't know. I didn't hear about that.
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.900]  There's some old NES classic game
[53:59.900 --> 54:01.740]  that I guess they mentioned how to make it
[54:01.740 --> 54:04.120]  multiplayer in the instruction manual
[54:04.120 --> 54:05.580]  but nobody read that.
[54:06.000 --> 54:06.760]  Nobody ever?
[54:06.860 --> 54:08.500]  In 40 years?
[54:09.440 --> 54:10.880]  It just wasn't, like, unknown.
[54:11.060 --> 54:12.800]  It was just viewed as a single player game.
[54:13.160 --> 54:14.140]  I don't remember what game it was.
[54:14.220 --> 54:16.540]  Do you know what he's talking about?
[54:16.540 --> 54:18.560]  I'd love to know the answer to that.
[54:20.420 --> 54:22.220]  It was Duck Hunt, people have said.
[54:22.680 --> 54:22.880]  Wow.
[54:24.480 --> 54:26.800]  Speaking of Duck Hunt...
[54:26.800 --> 54:27.860]  Let's do it.
[54:28.680 --> 54:29.720]  Let's kill an eagle.
[54:32.600 --> 54:33.300]  Oh no!
[54:33.840 --> 54:35.100]  Okay, okay, okay.
[54:35.500 --> 54:36.480]  Oh my god.
[54:38.280 --> 54:39.100]  I'm doing it!
[54:40.640 --> 54:42.760]  Yeah, Vin's doing it!
[54:42.760 --> 54:43.240]  Ah!
[54:45.260 --> 54:46.340]  Watch out for the egg.
[54:46.740 --> 54:47.820]  How many eggs does he poo?
[54:49.440 --> 54:50.340]  There's gonna be one more.
[54:50.340 --> 54:51.320]  You don't gotta worry about it now.
[54:55.660 --> 54:56.060]  Goddamn.
[54:58.940 --> 55:00.600]  The world is your oyster, Andrew.
[55:03.160 --> 55:03.760]  Nailed it.
[55:04.320 --> 55:06.540]  It's always so sad when people are rude for being in the chat.
[55:08.500 --> 55:12.740]  There's nothing sadder than when people are like...
[55:14.760 --> 55:17.400]  I'm sorry guys.
[55:28.330 --> 55:30.670]  This is not a game you can read the chat and play.
[55:31.550 --> 55:31.990]  No.
[55:32.230 --> 55:35.270]  Every time I turn away for a second, you guys are already at that level.
[55:38.630 --> 55:41.130]  I'm just trying to speed us back to where we were.
[55:41.450 --> 55:41.710]  Yeah.
[55:46.310 --> 55:49.370]  The second to the most recent comment was...
[55:49.370 --> 55:50.070]  That sounds awful.
[55:50.310 --> 55:51.590]  And the next comment was...
[55:51.590 --> 55:52.790]  That sounds like so much fun.
[55:55.410 --> 55:58.730]  I wonder what they were both referring to.
[55:58.890 --> 55:59.770]  Beef fat?
[56:01.130 --> 56:01.510]  Probably.
[56:01.810 --> 56:03.070]  Beef tallow or whatever.
[56:06.530 --> 56:07.050]  Goddamn.
[56:07.830 --> 56:09.530]  The same spot for you, Tim.
[56:10.310 --> 56:11.250]  That's the last time?
[56:12.090 --> 56:13.130]  For me, it was.
[56:13.150 --> 56:14.110]  I don't remember last time.
[56:25.900 --> 56:28.180]  So do you get hats for spending the coins?
[56:28.680 --> 56:31.920]  If you pay 500 bucks, you can get a...
[56:31.920 --> 56:32.520]  Oh, shit.
[56:33.540 --> 56:36.020]  If you pay 500 bucks, you can get a...
[56:36.020 --> 56:37.980]  Like a item out of the vending machine.
[56:38.100 --> 56:40.280]  It just happens to have been a hat every time for me.
[56:40.420 --> 56:42.900]  I don't know if it's always hats or just my luck.
[56:43.820 --> 56:45.460]  I've only used the T coins.
[56:45.840 --> 56:46.040]  Oh, yeah.
[56:46.560 --> 56:47.720]  Get those characters.
[56:51.890 --> 56:52.810]  Oh, I remember this.
[56:53.350 --> 56:55.030]  We're getting fresher in my memory now.
[56:58.510 --> 56:59.930]  I feel like this one made me mad.
[57:00.570 --> 57:01.130]  Thank you.
[57:01.130 --> 57:01.190]  Thank you.
[57:02.730 --> 57:03.930]  How do you feel about it now?
[57:04.010 --> 57:04.530]  I love it.
[57:10.580 --> 57:14.020]  The way the audio cuts off through shitty party chat is so funny.
[57:17.790 --> 57:19.170]  Makes me feel young again.
[57:24.450 --> 57:25.590]  The coins wouldn't lie.
[57:25.970 --> 57:29.230]  The coins will surely guide me to...
[57:29.570 --> 57:29.990]  Yeah.
[57:30.570 --> 57:31.050]  They didn't lie.
[57:36.960 --> 57:37.440]  Oh.
[57:37.440 --> 57:37.520]  Oh.
[57:38.380 --> 57:39.100]  Oh.
[57:43.040 --> 57:44.920]  Come on, Geoff!
[57:45.220 --> 57:45.700]  Yeah!
[57:53.620 --> 57:55.960]  I was getting too comfortable there.
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.080]  Easy.
[57:59.080 --> 57:59.980]  Easy money.
[58:04.320 --> 58:06.220]  Really feels like a trend.
[58:06.960 --> 58:07.680]  This set of levels.
[58:09.220 --> 58:10.680]  You got a definite theme going.
[58:12.180 --> 58:14.320]  My therapist told me I need a new hobby.
[58:15.700 --> 58:16.100]  Yeah?
[58:16.360 --> 58:16.680]  Yeah.
[58:18.180 --> 58:20.360]  Do you have any idea what your new hobby will be?
[58:20.520 --> 58:21.640]  No, I don't like anything.
[58:23.040 --> 58:23.720]  That's a problem.
[58:24.200 --> 58:25.040]  Alright, let's concentrate.
[58:26.200 --> 58:28.740]  It's sort of a necessary part of having a hobby.
[58:29.280 --> 58:29.620]  I know.
[58:30.100 --> 58:30.660]  Fuck me.
[58:30.820 --> 58:32.200]  How do we do it?
[58:32.700 --> 58:33.860]  How did we ever do this before?
[58:34.140 --> 58:34.560]  This is bullshit.
[58:34.840 --> 58:35.320]  This is impossible.
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.220]  Where is...
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.660]  Okay, we can't wait.
[58:39.780 --> 58:40.360]  Can't wait.
[58:45.960 --> 58:46.560]  Wow.
[58:49.380 --> 58:50.880]  We blew it.
[58:52.180 --> 58:53.320]  We blew it.
[58:53.400 --> 58:53.980]  We sucked.
[58:54.040 --> 58:55.080]  I don't even remember that level.
[58:55.700 --> 58:56.640]  I don't either.
[58:57.360 --> 58:58.560]  What do I get?
[59:00.520 --> 59:02.280]  How far away were we?
[59:02.420 --> 59:03.440]  A poopy pigeon?
[59:04.880 --> 59:06.060]  I don't even know.
[59:06.060 --> 59:07.100]  It didn't even show.
[59:07.300 --> 59:07.960]  Oh man.
[59:08.520 --> 59:10.360]  I got a key and a padlock.
[59:10.540 --> 59:13.140]  We got another...
[59:14.300 --> 59:14.880]  uh...
[59:14.880 --> 59:15.580]  claim.
[59:15.900 --> 59:17.240]  What's a construction tower?
[59:20.260 --> 59:21.960]  These are achievements.
[59:23.440 --> 59:24.940]  I have achievements in this game?
[59:25.240 --> 59:25.720]  Seven?
[59:26.920 --> 59:27.280]  Wow.
[59:28.040 --> 59:29.660]  The stickers are achievement related.
[59:30.600 --> 59:31.620]  Do I have seven achievements?
[59:31.620 --> 59:33.320]  I got six. I'm shocked.
[59:34.600 --> 59:36.660]  I'm at 92% on a secret achievement.
[59:36.740 --> 59:37.680]  I don't even know what it is.
[59:38.180 --> 59:40.100]  Did you get the die 100 times achievement?
[59:41.100 --> 59:41.800]  Who, me?
[59:42.340 --> 59:42.680]  Who, me?
[59:43.780 --> 59:45.740]  Uh, I'ma guess so. Let's see.
[59:46.500 --> 59:47.620]  Cause I'm uh...
[59:48.600 --> 59:50.740]  Uh, blow up 50 fuse bombs,
[59:50.900 --> 59:52.480]  reach floor 50,
[59:53.280 --> 59:54.100]  play a multiplayer game,
[59:54.700 --> 59:55.640]  wear a silly hat,
[59:55.780 --> 59:56.940]  unlock construction tower,
[59:57.080 --> 59:58.660]  reach floor 10, complete tutorial.
[59:59.140 --> 59:59.500]  No.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.800]  Well, I'm ready for next time
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.780]  we play this. I got a fucking awesome teapot
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.740]  on my head. I am locked in.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.800]  I'ma buy some clothes. I can't wait to do this.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.640]  How many players is it?
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.780]  Four players.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.280]  So we'll be back. We'll do this again.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.060]  I had a lot of fun. I think you guys did too.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.780]  Yeah, the 500 machine is just hats,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.200]  I think.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.140]  Love a good hat.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.940]  Thank you so much
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.880]  for joining us in this
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.500]  technical difficulty filled stream.
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.760]  Thank you for your patience as we sorted through things.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.020]  I had a great time.
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.140]  I had a lovely time.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.800]  Make sure you check out our Patreon
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.820]  at the Regulation Pod. We got a YouTube channel,
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.000]  we got gameplays,
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.320]  all sorts of stuff.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.820]  Think about it this way, guys. It beats sitting in the waiting room
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.440]  at the minor emergency clinic
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.920]  with a fucking ice pack
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.600]  on your butthole.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.220]  That's true.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.720]  Always better than that. Thank you so much for joining.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.280]  Have a wonderful weekend.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.620]  Talk to you soon.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.140]  Bye!
