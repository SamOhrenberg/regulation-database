[00:01.480 --> 00:07.820]  Wait, don't start the game yet. We have to do an introduction to what is happening and what we're doing.
[00:08.040 --> 00:13.420]  Hello, Dark Park. Great. Great. Great. I didn't start the game.
[00:14.580 --> 00:17.660]  You're... yeah, I know, you're getting as close as you can without doing it.
[00:17.920 --> 00:22.820]  You're walking as close... you're walking as close to the light. Yeah, exactly.
[00:22.940 --> 00:27.840]  You're fucking edging the game, alright? Guys, Pico Park, Pico Dark, it's the Dark Park.
[00:27.840 --> 00:32.320]  We're back. Now, you think we're going to the Dog Park? Bow wow, you'd be surprised.
[00:32.480 --> 00:36.700]  It's the Dark Park. Yeah, it's the Dark Park. It gets even worse and scarier in the Dark Park.
[00:36.840 --> 00:42.160]  We beat all of the game somehow, by God's grace, we beat all of the regular game.
[00:42.440 --> 00:48.020]  And now, welcome to the Dark Park, where I think deaths are reset to zero,
[00:48.460 --> 00:52.420]  as we've had a whole counter the whole time to see whose fault it was.
[00:53.200 --> 00:56.960]  Because, in the Dark Park, I believe it keeps a tally of who died. It does?
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.380]  So you'll be able to see... Gavin, you'll be able to see on the screen the whole time who's most at fault.
[01:03.560 --> 01:06.460]  How do you feel about that? So argue with the game, Gavin. Don't argue with us.
[01:07.360 --> 01:09.820]  How do you feel about that? How does that make you feel? Sometimes death is not fault.
[01:10.580 --> 01:17.180]  That's true. Sometimes death is not fault. That's true. You can be pushed into death.
[01:17.180 --> 01:19.980]  I do agree with that. That is definitely true.
[01:22.060 --> 01:28.720]  I am very excited. Thank you for joining us on Twitch. This is fun. This is exciting.
[01:29.040 --> 01:36.480]  We're live and direct with you. Game Nerd with a Prime sub. Fixer with a Prime sub.
[01:36.680 --> 01:41.540]  Guys, the subs are coming in hot and heavy. Even Dead Nick. Whoa, that might be foreshadowing.
[01:41.740 --> 01:44.140]  What do you think about that, Nick? Wait, what? I don't like it.
[01:44.140 --> 01:52.000]  Jingle Master. Jingle Master with two gifted. King Mattresses used their very first time chat to spam Corncats.
[01:52.080 --> 01:55.080]  That's got to make you feel pretty happy. I'm all about the Corncats, baby.
[01:55.240 --> 01:58.140]  I can't start the game on Corncats. I have to start the game on a wool of piss.
[01:58.420 --> 02:02.340]  No. Is it Rebecca's birthday today? Corncats. Corncats. What?
[02:02.780 --> 02:07.940]  Is it Rebecca's birthday today? Happy birthday, Rebecca. Oh, happy birthday. I'm so glad we got to say it to you.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.240]  Look at that. Look at all the Corncats in the chat. Isn't that incredible?
[02:12.140 --> 02:13.580]  Everybody piss rat for Rebecca.
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.940]  Alright, let's go. Don't hit the button. Was that what it was? Don't hit the button.
[02:21.500 --> 02:25.940]  Okay. Hi. Well, you need to hit it and we get a space out. And then we get a space out.
[02:25.940 --> 02:28.820]  It's like a smash and grab. One.
[02:33.080 --> 02:36.480]  I don't remember. As long as it wasn't me. Gavin, you find out this time.
[02:36.480 --> 02:40.000]  Alright, check this out. Oh, we did it.
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.080]  Alright, now remember this one. This will be a spike on everyone's head at once.
[02:43.580 --> 02:45.980]  Yeah. So, we get a space out. We get to spread out a little bit.
[02:46.620 --> 02:49.960]  I'm going to go left. I'm with you, Nick.
[02:50.340 --> 02:54.760]  Alright, just count it down and tell us, Gavin. 3, 2, 1, dodge it.
[02:56.120 --> 02:58.860]  Nick killed me. No, that was definitely your fault.
[02:59.100 --> 03:04.040]  Nick killed me. There were two of them lined up. Some deaths aren't fault. That's pretty exciting.
[03:04.040 --> 03:09.140]  Well, not that one. Oh, shit. That scared me that time.
[03:09.480 --> 03:12.740]  Andrew, did you disconnect? No, I'm just adjusting my volume.
[03:13.200 --> 03:16.900]  Why are you off my ass? Alright, everyone ready?
[03:17.480 --> 03:19.520]  Yeah, I'm ready. Go for it.
[03:22.340 --> 03:24.680]  3, Geoff, what are you doing? I'm going to run.
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.860]  3, 2, 1, run. Perfect.
[03:29.100 --> 03:32.680]  That's crazy that it was Nick twice. Nick, did you run into the wall?
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.060]  No. Oh. Danced out, thank you.
[03:38.920 --> 03:40.940]  I'm going to stay close to the right side this time.
[03:41.240 --> 03:43.860]  Alright, you guys let me know when you're ready. Are you guys ready? I'm ready.
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.980]  Here we go. 3, 2, 1.
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.120]  Now, it seemed like Nick didn't move at all there. I lived.
[03:52.820 --> 03:57.680]  Oh, who's blue? I'm sorry. Gavin. I'm very offended by that.
[03:57.960 --> 03:58.920]  Well, I wasn't used to it.
[03:59.720 --> 04:02.920]  Yeah, the left side sucks. I'm being honest.
[04:04.300 --> 04:06.600]  And I don't think the move is to go left, by the way.
[04:07.940 --> 04:11.380]  You want everyone to go right? No, I just meant if you're on the left side.
[04:11.440 --> 04:13.320]  It's probably easier to go right. Alright, ready?
[04:14.440 --> 04:15.800]  3, 2, 1.
[04:18.020 --> 04:20.920]  And then the only other thing I remember is don't press this.
[04:21.700 --> 04:26.040]  Oh, now what's the trick here?
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.100]  Oh.
[04:29.600 --> 04:32.420]  We did it. Nailed it. Easy peasy.
[04:38.580 --> 04:41.700]  Splooge McDuck with a gifted sub. You can name yourself anything.
[04:41.860 --> 04:42.660]  I love this site.
[04:45.360 --> 04:48.260]  Alright, resets. Oh, God.
[04:48.860 --> 04:54.280]  What was that? I think it flies out at us.
[04:54.280 --> 04:57.620]  Press don't touch it. Oh, when you hit the key, maybe?
[04:57.900 --> 05:02.220]  Oh, when you jump. Oh, you jump. Well, don't jump.
[05:03.140 --> 05:06.780]  So how could we... Should we move and see what's to the right first?
[05:06.840 --> 05:07.560]  Yeah, sure.
[05:09.180 --> 05:12.440]  Alright, give it a shot, Nick.
[05:15.360 --> 05:17.020]  It said don't press.
[05:18.600 --> 05:19.800]  We were a little tight right there.
[05:19.800 --> 05:22.940]  To what? Pressing the button?
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.960]  No, I didn't have enough lead up space to run.
[05:27.860 --> 05:28.380]  Whoa!
[05:32.660 --> 05:35.600]  I think maybe one vertical jump there.
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.700]  Yeah, just jump up and down.
[05:39.740 --> 05:42.140]  Oh, then we get the key, huh?
[05:42.340 --> 05:45.580]  And then I can jump on someone's head.
[05:45.580 --> 05:49.420]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.900]  I thought I could jump over it, but I couldn't.
[05:54.220 --> 05:55.700]  Alright, hold on, hold on.
[05:58.660 --> 06:02.920]  So then I think we have to make a stack and walk over it.
[06:03.220 --> 06:04.360]  Like, we do this.
[06:05.260 --> 06:06.400]  All the way.
[06:09.040 --> 06:12.880]  No, because I'm not gonna press it. We're just gonna walk slightly to the right.
[06:13.680 --> 06:15.200]  Purple's gonna go almost all the way.
[06:15.460 --> 06:19.520]  Oh, okay, so it just launches. Got it.
[06:19.580 --> 06:24.600]  Why did it do that? I guess if we go over it, it'll shoot up, so we gotta maybe edge it a little bit?
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.420]  On the tower? Dude, I don't know.
[06:27.720 --> 06:29.160]  Gotta edge it on the tower, alright.
[06:31.880 --> 06:34.020]  I am not sure.
[06:36.180 --> 06:37.100]  You had it.
[06:37.100 --> 06:37.740]  You had it.
[06:38.380 --> 06:38.860]  What?
[06:45.580 --> 06:49.240]  So maybe if you go... I have to give you credit, that was pretty impressive.
[06:50.080 --> 06:52.060]  Maybe if you stack three...
[06:52.060 --> 06:55.440]  I take back everything I fucking said.
[06:55.680 --> 07:00.640]  I was just hitting A to start game. Do you press A?
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.860]  No, you don't have to. Turns out you don't.
[07:03.860 --> 07:06.420]  So wait, if I go up here...
[07:07.820 --> 07:09.360]  Dude, I don't...
[07:09.360 --> 07:15.460]  You can edge it better higher, right? Yeah, but I don't want to get hit by accident.
[07:16.180 --> 07:18.400]  I think you gotta go... Oh, that was almost it.
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.980]  This is tough. I think we go less staircase there
[07:23.980 --> 07:25.700]  and straight up.
[07:27.140 --> 07:29.180]  Alright, hop on, boys.
[07:32.840 --> 07:33.800]  Not staircase.
[07:38.220 --> 07:40.440]  So where do you want me to go? I'm at the bottom.
[07:40.820 --> 07:41.980]  Am I good here or do you want me to get closer?
[07:44.120 --> 07:46.940]  A little bit closer.
[07:48.700 --> 07:51.080]  Gavin, make sure you're not touching it.
[07:52.200 --> 07:53.480]  I think that's good.
[07:54.780 --> 07:56.380]  Should be close, but good.
[07:56.400 --> 07:58.040]  Is it going to be Nick jumping it?
[07:58.320 --> 08:01.900]  Am I jumping over or coming back?
[08:02.560 --> 08:06.940]  I think you have to because I think you're trying to trick it.
[08:08.780 --> 08:10.120]  Maybe try going over.
[08:12.620 --> 08:14.880]  Thank you for the subs. Appreciate you.
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.060]  I hit the wrong button.
[08:19.060 --> 08:21.540]  See, it's not so easy.
[08:21.700 --> 08:24.040]  I was hitting A to start.
[08:26.140 --> 08:27.620]  You're preaching to the choir.
[08:31.060 --> 08:32.280]  It's a game tradition.
[08:34.180 --> 08:35.220]  Game trope.
[08:46.740 --> 08:48.880]  Everyone get off of him.
[08:50.480 --> 08:52.020]  What do you think the trick is to this one?
[08:52.680 --> 08:53.920]  Don't press it.
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.860]  Should I try to edge it?
[09:06.060 --> 09:07.600]  It doesn't go as high.
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.600]  This is the one where we have to stack and the top person goes over.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.640]  How do we all get there?
[09:17.060 --> 09:19.340]  Maybe it jumps back based on that.
[09:19.340 --> 09:20.320]  Let's get the key.
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.560]  Honestly, by the end
[09:28.560 --> 09:30.700]  we can just walk back and get the key.
[09:32.520 --> 09:34.260]  Let me get you closer.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.340]  You want a hair closer?
[09:40.820 --> 09:43.260]  It's not even moving on my screen.
[09:46.740 --> 09:48.360]  We have to stack up.
[09:48.360 --> 09:49.780]  Let me get back on top.
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.460]  Andrew, all the way to the top.
[09:54.820 --> 09:56.820]  I think you're going to walk over.
[10:01.320 --> 10:04.920]  We have to not be so stair stacked.
[10:07.060 --> 10:08.480]  If we're straight up and down stack
[10:08.480 --> 10:08.860]  we'll be fine.
[10:11.300 --> 10:12.520]  Why did you do that?
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.380]  He landed on your head.
[10:15.560 --> 10:17.320]  Why did you jump?
[10:20.220 --> 10:22.360]  A lot of purple deaths.
[10:24.580 --> 10:27.180]  Mark the frog is helping people with their HVAC systems.
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.920]  Let's stair stack.
[10:36.020 --> 10:40.280]  Geoff, you're going to jump all the way across.
[10:44.260 --> 10:45.980]  Blue is going to go all the way across.
[10:46.240 --> 10:48.320]  What about that button over there?
[10:48.540 --> 10:50.540]  I think the button is going to kill us.
[10:55.300 --> 10:57.520]  If you can move it, then purple go across.
[10:59.240 --> 11:00.040]  You're going to go under?
[11:02.460 --> 11:04.660]  Why don't the other two go over?
[11:05.780 --> 11:07.300]  You're a fucking psycho.
[11:07.300 --> 11:09.880]  This is a drill.
[11:10.240 --> 11:12.160]  One, two, three, jump.
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.920]  One, two, three, jump.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.760]  It was a little late on that.
[11:22.240 --> 11:23.320]  Felt like it.
[11:28.920 --> 11:31.260]  Why are you third in line jumping?
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.140]  What are you thinking?
[11:32.140 --> 11:33.040]  I survived.
[11:35.540 --> 11:38.900]  You know when he's right, he's right.
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.500]  This is going to kill us.
[11:55.280 --> 11:57.300]  How do we want to do this?
[12:00.420 --> 12:01.260]  You want to time it?
[12:02.180 --> 12:02.820]  I'm good.
[12:02.900 --> 12:08.140]  If everyone starts way back...
[12:08.140 --> 12:10.100]  I'm not going to stop running.
[12:12.980 --> 12:14.220]  I'm not going to stop running.
[12:17.060 --> 12:19.380]  The only person who isn't is the guy who's closest.
[12:21.540 --> 12:22.040]  Perfect.
[12:25.140 --> 12:25.720]  You ready?
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.000]  Just trust him.
[12:30.020 --> 12:31.660]  I'm going to trust him.
[12:32.300 --> 12:39.980]  Put that on Nick.
[12:40.160 --> 12:40.720]  Why?
[12:43.140 --> 12:44.760]  I was told to trust.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.880]  It doesn't change anything.
[12:50.980 --> 12:54.040]  I don't trust you morons.
[12:54.040 --> 12:56.080]  I think the person you don't trust is you.
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.640]  I was proved right.
[13:02.080 --> 13:03.600]  The fool.
[13:05.980 --> 13:08.140]  Remember you can do this.
[13:09.820 --> 13:10.900]  I had a system.
[13:11.020 --> 13:15.580]  And then Nick was hanging out.
[13:16.080 --> 13:17.580]  I stood there.
[13:17.580 --> 13:19.060]  I'm going over.
[13:20.620 --> 13:22.400]  The door is not open.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.600]  Nick is going to solve it.
[13:29.520 --> 13:30.500]  Jump green.
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.760]  How do we do that now?
[13:36.180 --> 13:38.980]  You time it.
[13:39.820 --> 13:43.480]  Let me see how it goes.
[13:44.760 --> 13:45.940]  Don't stop running.
[13:46.080 --> 13:48.380]  Here we go.
[13:51.240 --> 13:52.040]  I was late.
[13:57.380 --> 13:59.340]  I hate to start.
[13:59.780 --> 14:00.400]  I hate to stop.
[14:02.040 --> 14:04.060]  I hate to start.
[14:05.140 --> 14:09.580]  What are you doing?
[14:09.580 --> 14:11.440]  This is...
[14:11.440 --> 14:14.560]  Nick is acting like it's Mario Party turn 20.
[14:16.140 --> 14:17.560]  Just turn 20.
[14:22.720 --> 14:24.820]  Getting a good stack going.
[14:25.400 --> 14:26.200]  This is incredible.
[14:33.280 --> 14:34.760]  There you go.
[14:35.560 --> 14:36.460]  Sucking my gut.
[14:36.860 --> 14:41.860]  That is fucking tough.
[14:43.700 --> 14:46.420]  It's a shame because we have beaten that part so many times.
[14:50.530 --> 14:51.270]  There we go.
[14:54.530 --> 14:55.730]  You got it, Nick.
[14:58.310 --> 14:58.790]  Nice.
[15:01.330 --> 15:02.370]  Good job, Nick.
[15:02.370 --> 15:03.330]  He makes this so funny.
[15:10.790 --> 15:12.490]  We'll just keep running in a line.
[15:13.790 --> 15:14.350]  Go.
[15:18.530 --> 15:19.890]  Here I come.
[15:23.250 --> 15:24.690]  Beautiful, Geoff.
[15:24.970 --> 15:26.870]  You're the best player at this game.
[15:28.090 --> 15:30.590]  Congratulations. You're the best player at this game.
[15:33.570 --> 15:34.870]  Way to go.
[15:35.230 --> 15:35.830]  Shouts out, Geoff.
[15:41.190 --> 15:42.770]  I'm scared to move.
[15:42.770 --> 15:44.790]  A bullet bill coming.
[15:55.630 --> 15:57.910]  Can we keep those in RAM and all?
[15:58.430 --> 15:59.590]  Only one person died.
[16:02.990 --> 16:04.930]  Should I jump on this?
[16:06.510 --> 16:07.830]  We have to go up.
[16:09.390 --> 16:10.630]  Maybe tease it.
[16:11.450 --> 16:13.110]  I think we're teasing it.
[16:13.610 --> 16:17.230]  I think it's just knowing when to get off.
[16:21.290 --> 16:23.350]  I don't think teasing works, guys.
[16:24.650 --> 16:28.890]  I was standing there and I just got cannon foddered.
[16:28.890 --> 16:31.530]  What if we make a stack and tease it with our heads?
[16:34.090 --> 16:35.910]  It's not a bad idea.
[16:35.910 --> 16:37.410]  It's just the way he said it.
[16:39.310 --> 16:42.350]  Let's see if we can get it teased.
[16:42.830 --> 16:46.250]  Maybe tease it closer to the thing so we have an extra time to avoid it.
[16:48.650 --> 16:49.530]  Go right.
[16:53.370 --> 16:54.530]  You're going to tease it.
[16:55.650 --> 16:55.750]  Whoa.
[16:58.230 --> 16:58.930]  That'll work.
[16:59.810 --> 17:00.630]  That'll work.
[17:02.660 --> 17:03.710]  Let's stack on...
[17:04.370 --> 17:08.210]  Honestly, I think do four and I'll jump.
[17:08.750 --> 17:12.690]  It didn't trigger it?
[17:12.930 --> 17:14.790]  I think it's going to be five.
[17:17.430 --> 17:19.250]  We could potentially do it on the platform.
[17:23.110 --> 17:24.050]  Let's do four.
[17:24.050 --> 17:26.210]  Let's do that.
[17:26.590 --> 17:32.150]  This is going to be it.
[17:32.350 --> 17:34.890]  What do we...
[17:35.960 --> 17:37.630]  Maybe even further to the right.
[17:40.890 --> 17:44.050]  There we go.
[17:47.050 --> 17:48.070]  Nice!
[17:49.110 --> 17:50.670]  Good job, fellas.
[17:50.670 --> 17:51.730]  Hang on.
[17:54.430 --> 17:56.770]  For the love of...
[17:56.770 --> 17:59.950]  Do we want to make a tower?
[18:02.390 --> 18:04.430]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:04.750 --> 18:08.890]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:09.830 --> 18:11.450]  There we go.
[18:14.290 --> 18:15.070]  There's no room.
[18:16.170 --> 18:18.570]  I didn't want to drop down and kill us.
[18:22.490 --> 18:24.790]  I'm going to drop down and see what happens.
[18:25.250 --> 18:26.330]  You've killed us!
[18:29.250 --> 18:30.370]  So far...
[18:32.270 --> 18:33.830]  You killed us!
[18:35.290 --> 18:36.710]  What did you do there?
[18:38.790 --> 18:40.470]  Do you think we can bullet bill it?
[18:42.190 --> 18:44.410]  Can you jump on top of it?
[18:44.790 --> 18:49.770]  We have to goomba stomp it?
[18:50.430 --> 18:55.170]  How else would we avoid it?
[18:56.050 --> 18:59.850]  That was a very legitimate scream by me.
[19:06.730 --> 19:07.870]  Nicely done!
[19:09.610 --> 19:12.910]  I'll be the one to cause Bullet Bill to come after us.
[19:13.350 --> 19:14.490]  We're going to have to do it again.
[19:18.900 --> 19:20.300]  We can just go straight over.
[19:21.460 --> 19:22.860]  Do we want to be in a stack?
[19:25.960 --> 19:29.060]  I think somebody has to stay up here and jump on him.
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.240]  I agree.
[19:34.140 --> 19:35.480]  We'll just run back.
[19:35.480 --> 19:36.160]  I'll be here a little bit.
[19:44.520 --> 19:46.240]  One person has to go down there.
[19:48.660 --> 19:49.860]  Poor son of a bitch.
[19:50.920 --> 19:53.180]  It probably shouldn't be somebody with a hat.
[19:56.820 --> 19:57.520]  I'll go down.
[20:00.520 --> 20:01.500]  Sounds good, man.
[20:01.500 --> 20:02.440]  Alright, go for it.
[20:04.820 --> 20:06.260]  Build the tower!
[20:09.060 --> 20:10.780]  That was too keen.
[20:14.320 --> 20:16.520]  You abandoned us to die.
[20:16.760 --> 20:18.000]  He really wanted to do it.
[20:28.440 --> 20:30.480]  What are you guys doing?
[20:30.480 --> 20:31.420]  Now it's easy.
[20:31.800 --> 20:35.640]  I'll go get him.
[20:36.660 --> 20:39.240]  I'll jump on him.
[20:43.320 --> 20:45.000]  Red can do it.
[20:45.620 --> 20:48.480]  Do you want to make a tower so we can extend beyond the platform?
[20:49.920 --> 20:52.360]  It's going to be Andrew on...
[20:52.360 --> 20:55.600]  You two just stay safe.
[20:56.460 --> 20:57.260]  I heard it.
[21:00.220 --> 21:02.300]  I didn't hear him. What noise does it make?
[21:03.580 --> 21:06.780]  I think we need a four person tower.
[21:14.010 --> 21:15.670]  This is the easy part.
[21:16.570 --> 21:17.250]  Please, Red.
[21:19.770 --> 21:21.270]  Get your head in the fucking game.
[21:21.330 --> 21:25.730]  Are you?
[21:26.390 --> 21:28.370]  He's thriving and surviving.
[21:31.490 --> 21:32.890]  Alright, it's going to be me.
[21:34.670 --> 21:35.950]  Good luck, Geoff.
[21:36.290 --> 21:40.550]  I think the purple can go a step out more.
[21:41.970 --> 21:43.710]  Do you want me to go a step out?
[21:45.110 --> 21:46.390]  Yeah, I'm listening.
[21:49.530 --> 21:51.230]  Go, go, go!
[21:52.930 --> 21:54.670]  Okay, so it has to be on the top as well.
[21:54.730 --> 21:56.370]  It can't be on the front sliding face.
[22:10.790 --> 22:12.590]  Okay, everyone was on my head the whole time.
[22:13.830 --> 22:14.650]  Alright, Gavin, go ahead.
[22:16.910 --> 22:18.370]  Why'd you drop already?
[22:18.590 --> 22:20.410]  I thought people were coming up.
[22:20.770 --> 22:23.710]  We already have to get stacked up there.
[22:24.050 --> 22:28.850]  That way this part never happens again.
[22:31.070 --> 22:34.970]  Because every time I go up there, everybody else comes up.
[22:35.270 --> 22:35.970]  Alright, let's stack.
[22:38.430 --> 22:40.230]  The thing was going up.
[22:41.370 --> 22:41.890]  Stack.
[22:43.670 --> 22:44.730]  Go, we got it from here.
[22:46.950 --> 22:50.150]  Geoff, you want to call it over again?
[22:51.190 --> 22:52.970]  No, I'll do it.
[22:54.670 --> 22:55.990]  You got it, Andrew?
[23:00.100 --> 23:00.900]  You're gone!
[23:04.860 --> 23:08.640]  I saw Andrew fall right down and I went, someone's got to do it.
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.240]  I died.
[23:10.500 --> 23:14.400]  I tried to make a further jump because I didn't think he was going to make it.
[23:15.500 --> 23:16.520]  I think it was too fast.
[23:18.920 --> 23:19.520]  What are you doing?
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.560]  If you have a three stack, you can just jump.
[23:29.140 --> 23:30.320]  If you just jump, it'll work.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.100]  I've been doing it as a three stack the last few times.
[23:35.100 --> 23:37.020]  Why are we all...
[23:37.020 --> 23:44.940]  Alright, who's going to be the lure?
[23:45.740 --> 23:47.140]  I can be the schmuck.
[23:50.440 --> 23:55.600]  Remember, jump, not fall.
[23:58.880 --> 23:59.640]  There.
[24:03.740 --> 24:04.400]  Little late.
[24:16.980 --> 24:19.860]  This front bit is a piece of piss now, I love it.
[24:25.520 --> 24:27.860]  Why are you there?
[24:28.120 --> 24:30.180]  I wasn't sure if Gavin wanted to be the tease again.
[24:30.180 --> 24:36.200]  I went back because I wasn't sure if Gavin wanted to be the tease.
[24:36.540 --> 24:37.120]  You ready?
[24:39.220 --> 24:39.660]  Run!
[24:46.520 --> 24:48.040]  You saved me!
[24:49.820 --> 24:51.540]  You saved me real good.
[24:54.560 --> 24:56.400]  Is it like a little hide hole?
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.780]  I think it's a hide hole.
[24:59.620 --> 25:01.180]  Alright, I'm going to jump and grab.
[25:02.500 --> 25:04.560]  There's no way that it's just jump and grab.
[25:07.840 --> 25:08.280]  Andrew?
[25:13.900 --> 25:15.060]  I'm just nervous, I'm scared.
[25:19.580 --> 25:22.920]  Maybe if we'd stacked any higher there, it would've sent them.
[25:24.260 --> 25:24.700]  Probably.
[25:26.120 --> 25:29.860]  Somebody said, I like how they're happy, like they're not going to be jumping on that bullet again later.
[25:31.100 --> 25:34.300]  Well, not that exact bullet, we made that bit.
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.300]  Get away from me.
[25:37.660 --> 25:40.680]  Get the fuck away from- oh my god, Andrew.
[25:43.620 --> 25:44.640]  We're just here testing.
[25:44.920 --> 25:47.900]  Are you looking at the bottom of the screen?
[25:48.820 --> 25:51.260]  Nobody was moving, we're all just standing still, and there we go.
[25:51.260 --> 25:52.980]  Gavin tested as well.
[25:53.420 --> 25:55.660]  Now we definitely know, don't do that.
[25:55.740 --> 26:00.940]  Get away from me, get away from me.
[26:01.620 --> 26:03.220]  I'm going this way, I'm running right.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.360]  Here we go.
[26:08.980 --> 26:11.820]  Listen, I understand.
[26:14.380 --> 26:16.240]  Looks like we didn't understand.
[26:17.340 --> 26:17.820]  Wow!
[26:19.140 --> 26:22.800]  We need someone to just stand at this, and then they can push from my head.
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.460]  It looks like there's one underneath it as well.
[26:28.600 --> 26:29.400]  There is.
[26:30.420 --> 26:32.480]  It's a double red, I see the red sticking out.
[26:38.020 --> 26:39.380]  That's what we died, isn't it?
[26:40.640 --> 26:43.920]  Jump over it, jump over it, and go from the other side maybe.
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.380]  I assume we need it, so we need to push from my...
[26:47.380 --> 26:51.600]  Gavin needs to be touching it, and then...
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.460]  It's like this, but Gavin doesn't move.
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.820]  How do we do this?
[27:01.140 --> 27:02.660]  Is this still two?
[27:03.860 --> 27:06.780]  Why didn't Geoff just push the back of us?
[27:07.180 --> 27:08.640]  If I'm pushing Gavin, it counts.
[27:08.640 --> 27:10.440]  Yeah, but isn't it going to kill Gavin?
[27:11.060 --> 27:12.960]  Not if Gavin's not moving.
[27:13.300 --> 27:18.940]  What if Andrew pushes the back of Eric?
[27:22.000 --> 27:22.860]  Oh, there.
[27:24.600 --> 27:26.100]  We have to...
[27:26.100 --> 27:29.400]  Try it.
[27:32.280 --> 27:34.500]  Geoff, you have to keep going.
[27:37.280 --> 27:37.720]  Sorry.
[27:38.880 --> 27:39.580]  Oh shit.
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.860]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[27:45.020 --> 27:46.540]  That's a little red guy.
[27:50.820 --> 27:53.860]  When he moved it, there's a red one under the one.
[27:54.340 --> 27:54.800]  Oh, is there?
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.480]  Maybe go from the other side and see what happens.
[28:02.440 --> 28:04.140]  No, because we don't want to push it off, do we?
[28:04.400 --> 28:05.880]  I don't think we want it on this side.
[28:07.320 --> 28:09.400]  You want to push forward just to see what happens?
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.100]  Oh, is that going to fall on you?
[28:14.180 --> 28:15.500]  Yeah, that'll probably fall.
[28:22.570 --> 28:24.390]  You three go forward and I'll edge.
[28:27.110 --> 28:27.770]  It's not going to fall.
[28:27.770 --> 28:31.250]  We sure about that? I think it's still on it.
[28:31.570 --> 28:32.930]  I think it is too, but we can try.
[28:37.190 --> 28:39.390]  So that's what we'll push the one down onto, right?
[28:42.850 --> 28:43.830]  Please get away from me.
[28:51.600 --> 28:54.340]  So how do we do this? It just needs to go a little bit further.
[28:54.760 --> 28:55.940]  You guys have to...
[28:57.400 --> 29:00.180]  You shouldn't move. No, no, no. I should not.
[29:00.980 --> 29:03.500]  Bottom person there just needs to be against it, I guess.
[29:16.240 --> 29:22.140]  I don't know what the preoccupation is with getting as close as possible like this.
[29:23.880 --> 29:27.280]  If that person is risking their life, then give them space.
[29:27.380 --> 29:27.840]  What's the issue?
[29:30.620 --> 29:32.600]  Andrew, jump up here and push me.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.820]  That might be far enough.
[29:42.080 --> 29:44.960]  So how do we want to do this? We need one person up here.
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.580]  And they're going to push backwards.
[29:48.340 --> 29:49.640]  Do we need to push backwards?
[29:50.500 --> 29:53.420]  Once it gets past, I think.
[29:54.520 --> 29:56.600]  Get on the right side of that, Andrew.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.520]  You don't have to push it at all.
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.380]  No need to push.
[30:07.820 --> 30:11.080]  Why, Gavin? He has plenty of space.
[30:11.560 --> 30:13.480]  I just don't get what the point is.
[30:15.100 --> 30:17.260]  Orange, purple, red, push. That's it.
[30:18.100 --> 30:18.840]  A little more.
[30:21.600 --> 30:22.620]  That's probably fine.
[30:26.420 --> 30:27.460]  Group jump.
[30:30.520 --> 30:31.540]  Just wait on blue.
[30:33.960 --> 30:34.820]  Just wait on blue.
[30:36.120 --> 30:38.580]  We got plenty of time.
[30:40.020 --> 30:41.160]  Let's be respectful.
[30:41.660 --> 30:46.140]  He wants the space to move.
[30:46.180 --> 30:47.220]  Just wait on blue.
[30:49.900 --> 30:54.200]  Purple, orange, red.
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.160]  That's it.
[30:57.920 --> 30:59.140]  That worked for me.
[31:00.860 --> 31:02.800]  I keep getting body checked on that.
[31:04.700 --> 31:05.300]  Alright.
[31:06.020 --> 31:09.260]  I think that orange...
[31:09.260 --> 31:13.480]  I think orange jumps on top of purple and goes to the other side of one.
[31:14.480 --> 31:18.160]  And then we push this one.
[31:18.980 --> 31:19.600]  But not too far.
[31:20.200 --> 31:21.760]  Why is there a stack?
[31:22.220 --> 31:27.720]  We all push except Gavin.
[31:30.920 --> 31:31.880]  Keep going.
[31:32.660 --> 31:33.680]  That's pretty close.
[31:35.400 --> 31:38.320]  I think we want Geoff to push this thing off now.
[31:38.500 --> 31:41.540]  You guys move away and I'll push this down.
[31:43.740 --> 31:44.820]  Now you guys just push.
[31:49.120 --> 31:51.600]  Look, purple, red, green.
[31:52.980 --> 31:54.680]  Purple, red, green, push.
[31:54.680 --> 31:56.760]  Blue will edge it just a little bit more.
[31:57.300 --> 31:59.840]  Geoff can't get back up.
[32:00.080 --> 32:05.660]  I think Geoff you just have to stay up there.
[32:06.960 --> 32:08.640]  Geoff went too far.
[32:10.560 --> 32:12.080]  Maybe we should just see what's next.
[32:15.140 --> 32:16.160]  Push it left.
[32:19.260 --> 32:22.400]  I'm not sure what we don't get.
[32:22.400 --> 32:24.200]  But boy we don't get it.
[32:25.120 --> 32:27.160]  Give him space!
[32:30.320 --> 32:32.640]  I'm with Gavin on this one.
[32:33.540 --> 32:34.860]  The wrongest guys?
[32:36.560 --> 32:38.620]  I'm beginning to think Eric's right.
[32:41.160 --> 32:44.440]  What do you think Andrew's doing?
[32:44.440 --> 32:45.080]  There you go.
[32:52.360 --> 32:53.640]  Purple jump on green.
[32:54.380 --> 32:56.240]  And then someone jump on purple and get on the other side.
[32:58.360 --> 33:00.000]  You guys all line up.
[33:00.860 --> 33:02.620]  I'll edge it and you guys just push.
[33:06.100 --> 33:07.560]  Go ahead and drop that.
[33:10.520 --> 33:11.640]  We're pushing it again.
[33:12.340 --> 33:13.020]  We're good.
[33:16.840 --> 33:18.520]  No one fall down this hole.
[33:20.180 --> 33:21.920]  That's fine, go for it.
[33:24.810 --> 33:27.110]  Now we don't have to fuck with this I don't think.
[33:29.270 --> 33:30.150]  We might.
[33:31.870 --> 33:34.110]  One of us drop down and take a look.
[33:38.110 --> 33:39.610]  Blue can you go up against it?
[33:40.910 --> 33:41.890]  I can't push it.
[33:44.490 --> 33:45.890]  Do you want me to jump down?
[33:48.350 --> 33:49.710]  Can you jump up there?
[33:50.530 --> 33:52.310]  I need that block.
[33:56.030 --> 33:57.390]  Is there one over there?
[34:04.950 --> 34:06.390]  I need you guys to come down.
[34:07.290 --> 34:09.390]  If we come down we might be done.
[34:11.350 --> 34:12.710]  That's as far as we can go.
[34:16.210 --> 34:17.170]  Let's just do it.
[34:17.230 --> 34:20.650]  Everyone go.
[34:21.890 --> 34:22.930]  Hit that.
[34:25.770 --> 34:27.050]  Oh my god.
[34:30.470 --> 34:32.090]  Get the hell out of here.
[34:32.090 --> 34:34.010]  We almost gave up on that.
[34:36.430 --> 34:37.210]  Achievement!
[34:37.610 --> 34:41.330]  So simple.
[34:44.890 --> 34:46.850]  Except for us.
[34:49.030 --> 34:50.770]  Is that it?
[34:51.350 --> 34:55.070]  No, not the hard part.
[34:58.750 --> 34:59.330]  Oh boy.
[35:00.490 --> 35:01.610]  This doesn't seem bad.
[35:01.690 --> 35:03.670]  I'm going to do some testing.
[35:08.330 --> 35:10.090]  I think we should stay left.
[35:10.970 --> 35:12.490]  We don't go with it.
[35:17.070 --> 35:18.610]  That goes out from under us.
[35:19.190 --> 35:20.490]  We're not going to be able to stack up.
[35:20.590 --> 35:23.310]  We're going to have to run it.
[35:23.310 --> 35:24.730]  We're just going to have to run it.
[35:25.630 --> 35:26.170]  Ready?
[35:32.570 --> 35:33.950]  Left, left, left!
[35:34.250 --> 35:35.330]  Way to go, Nick!
[35:38.210 --> 35:39.930]  It's the first time.
[35:42.150 --> 35:43.990]  I feel like that was...
[35:47.750 --> 35:49.230]  That didn't last long.
[35:49.230 --> 35:53.390]  I'm back on Eric's side.
[35:57.610 --> 36:01.450]  I was still laughing at our inability to look forward one step.
[36:02.490 --> 36:03.650]  Alright, you guys ready?
[36:04.730 --> 36:07.530]  Alright, turn around.
[36:09.250 --> 36:09.690]  And again.
[36:12.810 --> 36:14.050]  Thank you!
[36:14.050 --> 36:16.950]  Why is someone...
[36:18.190 --> 36:19.970]  Did somebody not jump?
[36:20.130 --> 36:22.110]  Someone just wasn't moving good enough.
[36:22.350 --> 36:28.660]  Alright, you guys ready?
[36:32.400 --> 36:34.820]  It's actually faster than us, which sucks.
[36:36.140 --> 36:37.240]  Right, jump.
[36:39.680 --> 36:40.860]  It is faster than us!
[36:40.860 --> 36:41.840]  It's faster!
[36:43.180 --> 36:45.160]  No, Gavin!
[36:48.760 --> 36:49.840]  We really had it there.
[36:52.680 --> 36:53.940]  All together, really.
[36:57.060 --> 36:57.800]  That'll be the last one.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.380]  Gavin hesitated.
[37:06.700 --> 37:09.900]  It's just as easy to run off the front as it is to run off the back.
[37:09.900 --> 37:11.480]  I wouldn't know.
[37:30.260 --> 37:31.020]  Thoughts?
[37:32.240 --> 37:34.700]  I was running left, everyone else wasn't.
[37:36.500 --> 37:39.320]  Orange? Blue? Purple?
[37:39.700 --> 37:40.540]  Whoever's in front of me?
[37:40.540 --> 37:42.300]  We were all moving.
[37:42.600 --> 37:45.820]  Oh my god.
[37:48.140 --> 37:49.760]  Any thoughts there, you guys?
[37:50.980 --> 37:52.280]  Andrew wasn't moving.
[37:55.480 --> 37:56.680]  It's like Eric died.
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.980]  This thing being faster than us, we have to be...
[38:05.980 --> 38:06.560]  Yeah, we got it.
[38:08.540 --> 38:11.200]  It's a difference between getting it and executing it.
[38:11.340 --> 38:14.900]  I get it. Doesn't always mean the execution will be there.
[38:18.540 --> 38:19.160]  Wild.
[38:22.820 --> 38:24.920]  Go, go!
[38:26.480 --> 38:28.980]  Just curious about who stopped walking.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.520]  Who's... who's...
[38:34.520 --> 38:36.220]  Eh, we're close enough.
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.060]  Stop jumping on my fucking head, man!
[38:49.400 --> 38:50.920]  Andrew, well...
[38:50.920 --> 38:52.020]  I'm losing it.
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.160]  I'm losing it.
[38:54.260 --> 38:55.100]  It's so brutal.
[38:55.100 --> 38:57.480]  I'm falling apart.
[38:59.340 --> 39:00.780]  I don't get the hiccups.
[39:04.480 --> 39:05.540]  Oh god.
[39:09.600 --> 39:10.960]  Eric, why?
[39:11.220 --> 39:12.980]  Me and Geoff are hugging in the middle.
[39:13.420 --> 39:15.660]  I was trying so hard to go left.
[39:17.780 --> 39:19.600]  Geoff is so locked in.
[39:20.280 --> 39:22.380]  Greenwood and Lemmy.
[39:22.540 --> 39:27.140]  Just feels so doable to me.
[39:27.620 --> 39:30.180]  And I really feel like we should have already done it.
[39:30.900 --> 39:31.360]  I'm off.
[39:32.900 --> 39:34.340]  Should have jumped.
[39:39.020 --> 39:40.580]  I'll keep that in mind.
[39:42.500 --> 39:46.300]  That sounded like a criticism of you. I was not criticizing you, I was criticizing Gavin.
[39:46.300 --> 39:49.660]  Why would you criticize me? It was a good suggestion. Because you said some stupid shit.
[39:54.260 --> 39:56.080]  Now that one might be...
[39:57.520 --> 39:58.560]  Guys, look.
[40:01.940 --> 40:04.540]  Guys, it's too fast. You can't jump on me.
[40:09.560 --> 40:12.440]  This is the best game ever made.
[40:13.200 --> 40:14.640]  It's really good.
[40:17.280 --> 40:19.320]  It's real bad for you guys.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.260]  That was bad.
[40:24.720 --> 40:25.460]  That one was rough.
[40:27.160 --> 40:29.340]  That was a rough one.
[40:31.220 --> 40:32.840]  Sometimes they are, you know.
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.600]  Eric, I hear you.
[40:36.620 --> 40:37.300]  What?
[40:40.540 --> 40:41.820]  I can't get down.
[40:44.260 --> 40:45.740]  And look what?
[40:51.960 --> 40:52.640]  Gavin!
[40:55.680 --> 40:57.080]  And then I killed us.
[40:57.300 --> 41:00.540]  I was mad and I kept going right.
[41:00.540 --> 41:01.260]  Purple prick.
[41:01.520 --> 41:06.880]  No, but we didn't die and then you went purple prick.
[41:08.760 --> 41:10.640]  Listen, you blue buffoon.
[41:12.620 --> 41:13.300]  Purple!
[41:20.120 --> 41:22.780]  I was just laughing that time.
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.940]  This is really something, guys.
[41:25.940 --> 41:28.380]  This is the best game ever made.
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.280]  Sometimes blame and guilt affects your next attempt.
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.600]  That was blue.
[41:36.980 --> 41:38.220]  Good luck, Gavin.
[41:40.220 --> 41:43.920]  Nick, why did you stop?
[41:44.580 --> 41:50.160]  Red, orange, and blue were locked in.
[41:50.160 --> 41:52.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:54.840 --> 41:56.780]  This motherfucker needs to go water a tree.
[41:59.880 --> 42:01.640]  I do need to water a tree.
[42:01.940 --> 42:03.200]  You're dead. There's no way.
[42:05.060 --> 42:10.100]  I wonder if I could just stay on the
[42:10.100 --> 42:12.360]  key platform and jump back when it comes around.
[42:13.080 --> 42:16.080]  That would be a great move.
[42:16.080 --> 42:18.040]  Be the last one.
[42:22.090 --> 42:23.650]  That's me.
[42:26.210 --> 42:27.450]  I accept responsibility.
[42:29.630 --> 42:33.010]  I can't say this enough. I love this game.
[42:34.050 --> 42:36.510]  You guys suck. This game is awesome.
[42:37.550 --> 42:39.090]  Oh, Gavin.
[42:41.720 --> 42:42.890]  Grab me.
[42:42.890 --> 42:43.910]  The law.
[42:46.510 --> 42:48.910]  I can't say enough how much I love this game.
[42:49.090 --> 42:51.690]  I was so wrapped up in him saying the law.
[42:53.650 --> 42:55.750]  It just broke my brain.
[42:57.550 --> 42:58.810]  I said it on Geier.
[43:08.290 --> 43:10.610]  You so just don't want to be the person
[43:10.610 --> 43:11.950]  holding everyone up.
[43:16.910 --> 43:20.330]  Oh my god.
[43:21.590 --> 43:24.690]  You suddenly get used to your order.
[43:27.610 --> 43:29.910]  Hey, good try. There's only so much we can do there, bud.
[43:30.590 --> 43:34.750]  When you're in the back, you're at the mercy of Geoff in the front for some reason.
[43:35.170 --> 43:35.910]  Stay on the keyhole.
[43:37.050 --> 43:38.050]  It's too far.
[43:38.090 --> 43:41.370]  I evaluated.
[43:42.630 --> 43:44.850]  Oh my god.
[43:47.650 --> 43:48.810]  I've been there.
[43:50.810 --> 43:53.770]  You just get used to your spot in the rotation.
[43:54.450 --> 43:57.910]  This might just be my favorite game ever made.
[44:00.950 --> 44:02.330]  Go, go, go.
[44:02.330 --> 44:02.910]  Go, go, go.
[44:04.330 --> 44:06.110]  What do you mean?
[44:08.190 --> 44:11.230]  It's not going to work.
[44:15.030 --> 44:17.190]  Run and jump.
[44:17.990 --> 44:20.250]  Open the door.
[44:22.130 --> 44:23.770]  Why aren't you opening the door?
[44:25.530 --> 44:27.530]  I told you it worked, Gavin.
[44:29.010 --> 44:30.930]  I can't believe that worked, dude.
[44:30.990 --> 44:33.150]  Good job, Gavin.
[44:34.070 --> 44:38.230]  It was his only option, too, because he would have died if he hadn't done it.
[44:41.830 --> 44:43.330]  It's the block game.
[44:47.630 --> 44:49.270]  I'm scared. I don't want to move.
[44:49.270 --> 44:49.470]  Ah!
[44:54.630 --> 44:56.370]  I got a good thing going here.
[44:56.850 --> 44:58.510]  I'm nervous.
[45:01.170 --> 45:02.810]  Let's just focus on the right ball.
[45:05.250 --> 45:07.050]  I got a good thing going here.
[45:09.230 --> 45:10.970]  Guys, I'm locked in.
[45:13.830 --> 45:16.210]  Andrew, we need your ball.
[45:16.210 --> 45:17.710]  You're right.
[45:19.990 --> 45:22.830]  We made it to the blue, bro.
[45:23.410 --> 45:28.270]  Should we just use one ball at a time?
[45:29.450 --> 45:31.130]  Wait, wait, wait.
[45:31.310 --> 45:34.690]  Are we shrinking?
[45:35.530 --> 45:36.650]  I think so.
[45:37.450 --> 45:39.890]  Gavin, are you playing the game?
[45:40.230 --> 45:42.450]  I was looking if I was getting small.
[45:43.610 --> 45:44.730]  The answer is no.
[45:46.250 --> 45:47.410]  He's playing in his mind.
[45:53.810 --> 45:55.210]  We're shrinking. What does that mean?
[45:56.050 --> 45:57.770]  I mean, like, what's the...
[45:57.770 --> 46:00.210]  It just makes it harder, I guess.
[46:04.730 --> 46:06.710]  Do you want me to hold off on this one for now?
[46:12.350 --> 46:14.750]  I'm just not... I feel like not moving is kind of the move.
[46:15.790 --> 46:16.630]  Well, it wasn't.
[46:19.690 --> 46:20.850]  It's definitely a move.
[46:21.630 --> 46:24.610]  No, it's not the move. It's definitely not the move.
[46:25.730 --> 46:26.810]  It's just never been the move.
[46:30.010 --> 46:31.170]  I would hit the floor.
[46:33.630 --> 46:37.370]  Guys, there are fucking five of us.
[46:37.370 --> 46:41.030]  All we got to do is hit one ball. Keep one ball off the ground.
[46:41.470 --> 46:43.250]  It seems infinitely doable.
[46:44.590 --> 46:46.190]  My ball just got hit.
[46:48.550 --> 46:50.190]  The one that just vanished.
[46:58.310 --> 46:59.470]  This is our ball.
[47:00.950 --> 47:03.770]  If we sneak it around the top...
[47:03.770 --> 47:05.830]  Try to hit it left, Gavin.
[47:08.830 --> 47:10.270]  That was a good play.
[47:10.830 --> 47:12.070]  That was a pinball-brained move.
[47:15.510 --> 47:17.730]  Gavin has a unique set of skills.
[47:18.890 --> 47:19.630]  Oh no!
[47:24.270 --> 47:24.870]  Nice!
[47:29.550 --> 47:30.150]  Close.
[47:31.010 --> 47:32.130]  Got to one.
[47:32.210 --> 47:36.910]  Are we doing all at once?
[47:37.170 --> 47:41.490]  Well, at least three, I guess.
[47:42.190 --> 47:43.410]  And we lost him.
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.320]  Does the down arrow one, is that what makes us shrink?
[47:52.400 --> 47:54.260]  That makes sense.
[47:55.900 --> 47:59.380]  I didn't notice there were down arrow ones.
[48:00.900 --> 48:02.880]  Are we trying to break it through?
[48:03.100 --> 48:06.180]  I think we're trying to get rid of all the blocks.
[48:17.010 --> 48:18.110]  Oh my god.
[48:19.910 --> 48:23.690]  Oh, you took me!
[48:24.050 --> 48:25.670]  I know, I took you to the right spot!
[48:28.810 --> 48:31.050]  And then you did nothing after that.
[48:31.050 --> 48:33.050]  I thought Eric was going to get it.
[48:34.850 --> 48:36.110]  Based on what?
[48:36.510 --> 48:39.150]  You were next to it!
[48:39.970 --> 48:42.710]  Watching you not get it!
[48:44.990 --> 48:46.950]  I don't know if he's got me.
[48:48.670 --> 48:52.610]  How did that happen?
[48:53.670 --> 48:55.330]  Got trapped between...
[48:58.470 --> 49:00.590]  Who was next to it that time, Gavin?
[49:01.810 --> 49:02.950]  His imagination.
[49:09.810 --> 49:11.630]  Nick's just going for it.
[49:11.890 --> 49:16.370]  Look at this!
[49:17.890 --> 49:18.830]  We're tiny!
[49:19.910 --> 49:20.050]  We're tiny!
[49:22.550 --> 49:25.750]  We gotta make a tower to reach them.
[49:26.890 --> 49:28.830]  Good lord, we're fast though.
[49:29.790 --> 49:32.050]  That could have gone better.
[49:36.870 --> 49:39.850]  It's so bouncy.
[49:43.230 --> 49:45.470]  Wow, Eric. Come on, man.
[49:47.470 --> 49:49.910]  I spiked it into Eric's face.
[49:50.830 --> 49:52.010]  That was bullshit.
[49:52.010 --> 49:56.570]  Oh, I'm focused.
[49:56.830 --> 49:59.930]  I watched it disappear into Geoff somehow.
[50:00.090 --> 50:02.030]  I don't know how it disappeared into Geoff.
[50:05.210 --> 50:07.430]  Gavin sank focus on the ball.
[50:07.770 --> 50:09.670]  The first hit, the ball went away.
[50:10.170 --> 50:13.110]  What are we doing?
[50:14.210 --> 50:17.350]  Oh, this is bad.
[50:17.350 --> 50:18.650]  You got it cooked.
[50:20.750 --> 50:22.890]  Me and Nick got this one.
[50:23.950 --> 50:27.170]  I meant focus on the ball, not the emote.
[50:32.110 --> 50:35.430]  Eric, how should we play this?
[50:37.030 --> 50:38.670]  Let's jump at the same time. Ready?
[50:39.790 --> 50:41.530]  One, two, three.
[50:41.530 --> 50:42.550]  Yeah!
[50:46.910 --> 50:48.590]  Oh, nice.
[50:50.150 --> 50:52.930]  Oh, yes.
[50:53.390 --> 50:54.170]  Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
[50:57.890 --> 51:03.090]  Alright, everyone ready?
[51:04.870 --> 51:06.370]  Oh, no.
[51:06.370 --> 51:07.150]  Ah, shit.
[51:10.290 --> 51:11.690]  It's a good dodge there, Purple.
[51:12.450 --> 51:14.650]  I know, I know.
[51:16.710 --> 51:17.550]  This is hard.
[51:22.830 --> 51:23.950]  I mean...
[51:24.690 --> 51:25.730]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:29.710 --> 51:31.950]  I didn't even know there was a second one going.
[51:31.950 --> 51:34.890]  Look at how slow this one's going.
[51:35.750 --> 51:37.410]  Oh, yeah, cool it out when you get a start one.
[51:41.270 --> 51:42.270]  Good save.
[51:43.150 --> 51:43.610]  Thank you.
[51:47.390 --> 51:48.670]  There goes another.
[51:52.770 --> 51:55.750]  The sound of someone almost saying something.
[51:56.950 --> 51:58.170]  That's a lot of regulation.
[51:58.170 --> 52:00.750]  This is agonizingly long.
[52:03.890 --> 52:04.730]  Wow.
[52:05.210 --> 52:09.590]  Oh, that...
[52:13.720 --> 52:14.940]  The latest jump.
[52:19.620 --> 52:20.460]  Dammit.
[52:21.060 --> 52:25.940]  Oh, my God.
[52:26.980 --> 52:29.540]  I chased it to the corner.
[52:29.540 --> 52:33.540]  Oh, my God.
[52:38.770 --> 52:39.250]  Oh, God.
[52:39.270 --> 52:40.110]  Maybe this works better.
[52:40.390 --> 52:40.430]  No.
[52:54.520 --> 52:56.040]  We're getting small.
[52:57.120 --> 52:59.820]  We just need to break that last...
[52:59.820 --> 53:01.420]  We just need to get it behind it.
[53:05.340 --> 53:08.480]  I feel like Eric's thinking more about emotes than he is about the game.
[53:09.740 --> 53:11.680]  No, no, no, no, no.
[53:11.880 --> 53:13.760]  Oh, God, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[53:14.660 --> 53:16.900]  Eric has lost his goddamn mind.
[53:18.540 --> 53:20.440]  It's like 503 in his mind.
[53:24.220 --> 53:25.740]  This is a bad run.
[53:25.740 --> 53:27.660]  We're all as small as we can be.
[53:28.340 --> 53:30.800]  Eric, are you trying to tank the ball market?
[53:34.300 --> 53:34.700]  Okay.
[53:36.960 --> 53:38.740]  Yeah, Eric, what are your ball intentions?
[53:43.460 --> 53:44.900]  Get up there, get up there.
[53:45.100 --> 53:46.620]  Get up there, you son of a bitch.
[53:48.400 --> 53:49.920]  Eric, God damn, what was that?
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.980]  He's clicking an emote again. You would have got that if you weren't looking at the list.
[53:56.680 --> 53:57.920]  Yeah, he's doing it. Just do it.
[53:57.980 --> 53:58.280]  Fuck it.
[54:01.600 --> 54:03.800]  The only way for us to beat this is accidentally.
[54:04.480 --> 54:06.280]  I think the only way to beat it is to stop Eric.
[54:07.420 --> 54:08.800]  Jump on him before he can jump.
[54:10.460 --> 54:13.120]  Hold him down.
[54:13.120 --> 54:14.260]  Get him, get him.
[54:15.780 --> 54:18.200]  Why are you guys hitting them all anyway?
[54:18.900 --> 54:24.680]  I didn't even have to do anything that time.
[54:25.080 --> 54:27.440]  It's true. You didn't do anything any time.
[54:33.940 --> 54:36.360]  Guys, we figured it out. You just jump at the same time.
[54:37.100 --> 54:38.740]  Oh, come on.
[54:38.740 --> 54:41.100]  What did I just say, Andrew?
[54:41.200 --> 54:43.280]  It worked! What are you talking about?
[54:43.780 --> 54:45.680]  Why are you yelling?
[54:51.040 --> 54:52.620]  Stop being okay.
[54:52.860 --> 54:53.340]  There we go.
[54:56.080 --> 54:59.400]  Eric, try killing it right now.
[55:02.760 --> 55:05.320]  That was really bad.
[55:06.100 --> 55:08.080]  And I'm just accounting for that.
[55:08.280 --> 55:09.720]  And be honest about it.
[55:09.920 --> 55:14.520]  The physics are weird when you're so tiny.
[55:18.280 --> 55:20.480]  We're about halfway.
[55:24.100 --> 55:24.960]  We'll get it.
[55:28.820 --> 55:29.820]  We got it.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.640]  We got one out of it.
[55:31.640 --> 55:33.160]  We're doing great here.
[55:35.080 --> 55:38.120]  Look at all the work we're getting out of the fur.
[55:40.360 --> 55:42.860]  That's okay, we're back down to one.
[55:43.180 --> 55:46.180]  That's okay, we're back down to one.
[55:47.380 --> 55:48.500]  Problem solved.
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.100]  Gavin, you want to hit that one?
[55:57.100 --> 55:58.940]  There you go, great job, Gavin.
[56:01.220 --> 56:08.620]  Oh, this is...
[56:08.620 --> 56:10.580]  Nice pin, Andrew.
[56:20.700 --> 56:22.360]  Sorry about that.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.560]  This is fine.
[56:25.560 --> 56:26.960]  Just watch both, never mind.
[56:27.360 --> 56:29.520]  Problem solved.
[56:30.240 --> 56:34.920]  We got balls in the bank.
[56:38.280 --> 56:39.620]  Going into the bank.
[56:40.580 --> 56:41.880]  Let's make a deposit.
[56:44.500 --> 56:46.820]  Nice, Eric.
[56:48.560 --> 56:49.940]  I meant to say withdrawal, you're right.
[56:50.880 --> 56:53.500]  We all know that was right.
[56:54.380 --> 56:55.400]  We knew what you meant.
[56:57.360 --> 56:58.780]  Oh, Eric, that was great.
[57:01.400 --> 57:04.860]  It's so annoying that the whole final wall is still up.
[57:05.780 --> 57:06.820]  This is bad bounce luck.
[57:08.100 --> 57:11.220]  It looked like Purple dunked it.
[57:12.580 --> 57:17.680]  Why don't we go one at a time and focus every start ball in the same place?
[57:17.680 --> 57:20.680]  Like this.
[57:22.600 --> 57:24.300]  That's where you want us to focus it?
[57:26.460 --> 57:28.960]  Look, look, look.
[57:31.880 --> 57:33.620]  You stay there, just pin it.
[57:33.820 --> 57:35.320]  I'm just going to hold this one.
[57:36.580 --> 57:38.620]  Gavin, why did you jump?
[57:38.920 --> 57:41.680]  We have to time it.
[57:41.680 --> 57:45.480]  Oh, that was...
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.260]  It worked?
[57:48.320 --> 57:48.940]  Please.
[57:51.900 --> 57:53.120]  Okay.
[58:05.960 --> 58:07.120]  Oh, come on.
[58:10.440 --> 58:12.880]  It's okay.
[58:14.680 --> 58:16.700]  It worked out.
[58:16.700 --> 58:18.040]  Go, go, go.
[58:18.700 --> 58:21.180]  Good damage.
[58:21.500 --> 58:21.680]  Yes.
[58:28.520 --> 58:30.780]  It's all over now, baby.
[58:32.020 --> 58:33.760]  Oh, my God.
[58:35.540 --> 58:37.520]  I've never seen something so beautiful.
[58:38.500 --> 58:39.260]  Okay.
[58:39.260 --> 58:39.940]  Still very hard.
[58:41.640 --> 58:42.700]  Yes.
[58:46.770 --> 58:48.860]  Yes, yes, yes.
[58:52.200 --> 58:54.560]  Four, three,
[58:58.220 --> 58:59.280]  two...
[58:59.280 --> 59:00.820]  Oh, no.
[59:01.920 --> 59:02.980]  Yes.
[59:02.980 --> 59:03.880]  Yes.
[59:06.920 --> 59:08.940]  Let the magic happen.
[59:09.100 --> 59:11.260]  Oh, I like this.
[59:15.940 --> 59:18.200]  Hit it, hit it, hit it.
[59:18.200 --> 59:19.220]  Go, go, go.
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.120]  Yes.
[59:27.640 --> 59:30.000]  We did that for Rebecca.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.160]  That was for her birthday.
[59:34.440 --> 59:35.320]  Holy hell.
[59:37.380 --> 59:38.580]  Break the key.
[59:40.620 --> 59:42.500]  Do we have to avoid it?
[59:46.700 --> 59:47.980]  Let's just get out of the way of it.
[59:49.660 --> 59:51.820]  I don't know. You haven't done it yet.
[59:53.800 --> 59:54.680]  I missed.
[59:54.680 --> 59:56.100]  Oh, this is the net code, isn't it?
[59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.020]  Why are you so close to me?
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.460]  I didn't do anything, though.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.640]  You have to have run. I'm standing against it.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.380]  P-speed.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:14.960]  Okay, there we go.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.200]  Oh, no.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.840]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.540]  It resets.
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.600]  We have to get so much right in a row. This is unbelievable.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.180]  I love this game.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.580]  I think go under it, right?
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.480]  I don't know.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.320]  It's going to be a timeout.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.500]  I knew it was bad. You can just feel sometimes.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.840]  Nice jump, Geoff.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.720]  That was maybe my worst jump.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.980]  5-0-1!
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:02.900]  5-0-1, baby!
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.320]  Thanks so much for being here. Appreciate you guys watching.
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.880]  You can watch the spot on Tuesday.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.000]  That's a motherfucker.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.560]  And if you're watching the VOD, welcome to Halfway Through the VOD.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.220]  God!
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.900]  Take that, you bitch!
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.720]  Take that!
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.380]  Damn it!
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.500]  Is it going to be better if we do stacks on the second one?
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.060]  What's the other person going to do?
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.580]  One person will have to do it normal, but everyone else can just jump over the head.
[01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.710]  Like whoever's the best at jumping the whirly one.
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.990]  Fuck!
[01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:45.630]  We can stand on their head.
[01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.070]  I'm losing it. I'm losing it. I'm snapping.
[01:02:53.790 --> 01:02:54.790]  It's a small window.
[01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.410]  It gives us a window.
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.850]  It takes a lot of time to stack up.
[01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:07.930]  Bollocks and shit.
[01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.070]  Alright, here we go.
[01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.330]  Great job.
[01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:15.070]  I'm scared.
[01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:20.990]  I'm on again.
[01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.830]  I'm scared.
[01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:31.470]  Alright, stack up on Nick.
[01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:35.690]  Not yet.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.930]  After you've jumped over it.
[01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:41.670]  Wait!
[01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.790]  Jump over!
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.570]  Where's the first one?
[01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.970]  Oh, you didn't do the first one?
[01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:59.730]  I can't breathe.
[01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.110]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:07.230]  This is the funniest game I've ever played.
[01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.730]  Jump over the slide!
[01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.210]  That's us.
[01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.890]  Alright, stack up. Stack up.
[01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:24.990]  Everyone can get it over easily. Only one person has to do it proper.
[01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.070]  Get up! Jump!
[01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.530]  Why did you move on the bottom?
[01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:37.050]  The stack's a great idea.
[01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:41.630]  I can't even play the game right now.
[01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.710]  Gavin is so into this stacking thing.
[01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:45.230]  It's great.
[01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:49.070]  Get on!
[01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:54.750]  What the hell is that?
[01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.530]  It's telling us what to do.
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:01.850]  I can't.
[01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.510]  This is so funny.
[01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:06.850]  We got a hint in Dark Park.
[01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.350]  A little bit of light in the dark.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.460]  Alright, stack up.
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.420]  Alright, purple.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.340]  Why did the middle go?
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.480]  I'm getting shot!
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.340]  Fuck!
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.300]  We don't even know what the bowl after this is going to do.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.960]  Maybe there isn't one.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.940]  Come on! Jump on!
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.240]  The towers were equal.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.180]  Alright.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:58.420]  It's hard. It's really hard.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.860]  Alright, stack on me.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.080]  Get on me.
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.220]  You're close.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.400]  Alright, Nick first.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.960]  Then Eric, then Geoff, then me.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.860]  Andrew, and the netcode.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.660]  It's close!
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.600]  Great try.
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.520]  I want to do it again.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.260]  Correct!
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.140]  Geoff!
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.220]  I thought you had it, Eric!
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.020]  It was so close. Stack on me.
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.100]  Oh, we missed it. Never mind.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.060]  Oh, I missed it. Never mind.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.860]  Who wants to do the wiffly jump?
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.060]  I don't mind doing the wiffly.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:08.260]  No, you already started stacking on you.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:09.860]  Nick!
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.940]  I got pushed off. You ran four feet into it.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.160]  Yeah, well...
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.200]  Okay.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.160]  Go, get up.
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.860]  You adjust.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.120]  Just move left.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.140]  Should we just stack for all of it?
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:42.120]  No.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:42.400]  No.
[01:07:54.610 --> 01:08:03.610]  Okay, great. It's looking good.
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.210]  Alright, here goes Andrew.
[01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.590]  Let's move up.
[01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:14.350]  What the hell was that?
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:15.790]  Oh no.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.940]  It's a real slow one.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:25.800]  Go!
[01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.410]  Alright, move up, move up, move up.
[01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:34.670]  It was a good try.
[01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:35.890]  It was a real good try.
[01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.050]  It was solid shit, man.
[01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:41.170]  Oh, I'm scared.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:57.060]  Oh my God.
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.300]  Oh God! Oh Christ!
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.940]  I'm just going, I'm just going, I'm just going.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:09.480]  I'm just going.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:14.860]  Just go, just go! Get over it!
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.920]  We really backed you into a corner with that one.
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.020]  Yeah, we really did.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.740]  Yes, we know!
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.620]  We're doing it!
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.720]  Good stack. Great stack.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.900]  Wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.140]  Got it? That was so good.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.320]  Oh wait, hold on. Okay. Hold what? Nothing.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.980]  Hold the line. Okay, that's close.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.600]  Oh fuck.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.440]  Yes! Stack, stack!
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.620]  It might come out really fast. Yeah, I, yeah.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.100]  Let's start here and we'll go from there, yeah?
[01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:23.720]  Oh no! Oh no, we have to get past the gate!
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.340]  Stack. Stack. Stack. We destacked. Stack.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.680]  There you go. Up for the door. Up for the door.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.420]  I mean, we're not going to die. Just go, just go.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.980]  Just go, just get in! Unbelievable.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.660]  Guys, thank you so much for watching P1 Park.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.840]  Hard Park, Hard Park. We have another level in Hard Park, Dark Park.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.880]  You'll see that next time we play this.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.980]  Pretty impressive what we saw here today.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.940]  I don't know how that happened, but it happened.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.000]  Was that a world first? That might be.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.560]  That might be the first time in the world I've done that.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.440]  Somebody get in touch with Games Done Quick and let them know about our time there.
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:15.140]  I can't believe I didn't throw a fastball at us right at the end.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:15.680]  Yeah, really.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:23.420]  I feel insane. Thank you so much for watching.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.140]  We will have the podcast soon and we have Mario Party
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.200]  and Patreon.com slash RegulationPod. We have it all.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.240]  We'll see you next time. Watch this VOD later. Bye guys. Thank you. Bye.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.580]  Have a Regulation evening. Bye bye. Bye.
