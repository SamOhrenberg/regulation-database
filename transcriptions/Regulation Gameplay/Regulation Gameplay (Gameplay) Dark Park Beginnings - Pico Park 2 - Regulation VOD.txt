[00:00.000 --> 00:00.440]  Great.
[00:03.400 --> 00:07.820]  Wait, don't start the game yet. We have to do an introduction to what is happening and what we're doing.
[00:08.140 --> 00:09.380]  Hello, Dark Park.
[00:10.140 --> 00:10.200]  Great.
[00:10.920 --> 00:11.220]  Great.
[00:11.960 --> 00:12.260]  Great.
[00:12.680 --> 00:13.460]  I didn't start the game.
[00:14.620 --> 00:17.720]  You're... yeah, I know, you're getting as close as you can without doing it.
[00:17.720 --> 00:20.080]  He's on the edge. He's edging.
[00:20.660 --> 00:24.460]  You're walking as close to the light. Yeah, exactly. You're fucking edging the game, alright?
[00:24.600 --> 00:29.020]  Guys, Pico Park, Pico Dark, it's the Dark Park. We're back.
[00:29.020 --> 00:33.180]  Now, you think we're going to the dog park? Bow wow, you'd be surprised. It's the Dark Park.
[00:33.620 --> 00:36.740]  Yeah, it's the Dark Park. It gets even worse and scarier in the Dark Park.
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.200]  We beat all of the game somehow, by God's grace, we beat all of the regular game.
[00:42.480 --> 00:48.060]  And now, welcome to the Dark Park, where I think deaths are reset to zero,
[00:48.580 --> 00:52.460]  as we've had a whole counter the whole time to see whose fault it was.
[00:53.540 --> 00:56.500]  Because, in the Dark Park, I believe it keeps a tally of who...
[00:56.500 --> 00:56.980]  It does?
[00:58.220 --> 01:03.440]  So, you'll be able to see... Gavin, you'll be able to see on the screen the whole time, who's most at fault.
[01:03.620 --> 01:06.500]  So, argue with the game, Gavin. Don't argue with us.
[01:07.420 --> 01:08.920]  How do you feel about that? How does that make you feel?
[01:09.040 --> 01:11.220]  Sometimes, death is not fault. That's true.
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.220]  Sometimes, death is not fault. That's true. You can be pushed into death.
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.000]  I do agree with that. That is definitely true.
[01:22.140 --> 01:25.960]  I am very excited. Thank you for joining us on Twitch.
[01:26.640 --> 01:32.700]  This is fun. This is exciting. We're live and direct with you.
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.520]  Game Nerd with a prime sub. Fixer with a prime sub.
[01:36.780 --> 01:41.560]  Guys, the subs are coming in hot and heavy. Even Dead Nick. Whoa, that might be foreshadowing.
[01:41.780 --> 01:42.620]  What do you think about that, Nick?
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.180]  Wait, what? I don't like it.
[01:44.420 --> 01:46.400]  Jiggle Master. Jiggle Master with two gifted.
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.000]  King Mattresses used their very first time chat to spam Corn Cats.
[01:52.120 --> 01:53.320]  That's got to make you feel really happy.
[01:53.760 --> 01:55.120]  I'm all about the Corn Cats, baby.
[01:55.120 --> 01:58.240]  I can't start the game on Corn Cats. I have to start the game on a wall of piss.
[01:58.500 --> 01:58.820]  No!
[01:59.860 --> 02:01.280]  Isn't it Rebecca's birthday today?
[02:01.660 --> 02:01.980]  What?
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.680]  Isn't it Rebecca's birthday today? Happy birthday, Rebecca.
[02:04.760 --> 02:06.160]  Happy birthday!
[02:06.720 --> 02:07.980]  I'm so glad we got to say it to you.
[02:08.040 --> 02:10.280]  Look at that. Look at all the Corn Cats in the chat. Isn't that incredible?
[02:12.160 --> 02:13.620]  Everybody piss rat for Rebecca.
[02:14.980 --> 02:16.600]  Alright, let's go.
[02:17.280 --> 02:17.960]  Don't hit the button.
[02:19.180 --> 02:20.080]  Was that what it was?
[02:20.340 --> 02:20.980]  Don't hit the button.
[02:22.620 --> 02:22.940]  Hi.
[02:23.480 --> 02:24.500]  Well, you need to hit it.
[02:24.500 --> 02:25.320]  We got to space out.
[02:25.760 --> 02:27.740]  It's like a smash and grab.
[02:28.540 --> 02:28.860]  One.
[02:33.260 --> 02:33.900]  I don't remember.
[02:34.540 --> 02:35.260]  As long as it wasn't me.
[02:35.500 --> 02:36.520]  Gavin, you find out this time.
[02:36.680 --> 02:37.160]  Alright, check this out.
[02:39.160 --> 02:40.020]  We did it!
[02:40.340 --> 02:43.120]  Alright, now remember this one. This will be a spike on everyone's head at once.
[02:43.640 --> 02:43.800]  Yeah.
[02:44.480 --> 02:46.260]  We got to space out. We got to spread out a little bit.
[02:46.700 --> 02:47.600]  I'm going to go left.
[02:49.280 --> 02:50.020]  I'm with you, Nick.
[02:50.440 --> 02:52.100]  Alright, just count it down and tell us, Gavin.
[02:52.100 --> 02:54.940]  3, 2, 1, dodge it!
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.140]  Nick killed me.
[02:57.640 --> 02:58.900]  No, that was definitely your fault.
[02:59.120 --> 02:59.940]  Nick killed me.
[02:59.940 --> 03:01.340]  There were two of them lined up.
[03:01.740 --> 03:04.080]  Some deaths aren't fault. Some deaths aren't fault. That's pretty exciting.
[03:04.640 --> 03:05.400]  Well, not that one.
[03:06.740 --> 03:07.260]  Oh, shit.
[03:07.980 --> 03:09.060]  That scared me that time.
[03:09.520 --> 03:10.480]  Andrew, did you disconnect?
[03:10.680 --> 03:10.700]  Yep.
[03:10.700 --> 03:10.860]  Okay.
[03:11.020 --> 03:12.760]  No, I'm just adjusting my volume.
[03:13.260 --> 03:14.400]  Why are you off of my ass?
[03:16.060 --> 03:16.900]  Alright, everyone ready?
[03:17.540 --> 03:18.100]  Yep, I'm ready.
[03:18.200 --> 03:18.400]  Two seconds.
[03:18.560 --> 03:18.920]  I'm ready.
[03:19.040 --> 03:19.300]  Go for it.
[03:21.780 --> 03:22.180]  Three.
[03:22.920 --> 03:23.680]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[03:24.000 --> 03:24.180]  Geoff.
[03:24.200 --> 03:24.720]  I'm going to run.
[03:24.980 --> 03:25.240]  Okay.
[03:25.420 --> 03:27.020]  3, 2, 1, run!
[03:28.500 --> 03:28.900]  Perfect.
[03:29.120 --> 03:31.120]  That's crazy that it was Nick twice.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.720]  Nick, did you run into the wall?
[03:33.720 --> 03:33.880]  No.
[03:34.220 --> 03:34.360]  Oh.
[03:35.080 --> 03:36.080]  Danced out, thank you.
[03:38.940 --> 03:40.960]  I'm going to stay close to the right side this time.
[03:41.280 --> 03:42.500]  Alright, you guys let me know when you're ready.
[03:42.500 --> 03:42.980]  Are you guys ready?
[03:43.200 --> 03:43.880]  I'm ready.
[03:44.200 --> 03:44.940]  Here we go.
[03:45.040 --> 03:47.000]  3, 2, 1.
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.920]  Now it seemed like Nick didn't move at all there.
[03:51.440 --> 03:52.160]  I lived.
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.460]  Oh, who's blue?
[03:53.640 --> 03:53.960]  I'm sorry.
[03:54.120 --> 03:54.340]  Gavin.
[03:54.860 --> 03:55.440]  Oh, Gavin.
[03:55.700 --> 03:57.700]  I'm very, very offended by that.
[03:57.980 --> 03:58.980]  Well, I wasn't used to it.
[03:59.840 --> 04:01.740]  Yeah, the left side sucks.
[04:02.100 --> 04:02.920]  I'm being honest.
[04:04.380 --> 04:06.600]  And I don't think the move is to go left, by the way.
[04:08.020 --> 04:09.020]  You want everyone to go right?
[04:09.700 --> 04:12.380]  No, I just meant if you're on the left side, it's probably easier to go right.
[04:12.760 --> 04:13.340]  Alright, ready?
[04:14.580 --> 04:15.840]  3, 2, 1.
[04:17.160 --> 04:17.720]  Very good.
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.080]  And then the only other thing I remember is don't press this.
[04:21.560 --> 04:21.600]  Okay.
[04:24.420 --> 04:26.140]  Now what's the trick here?
[04:29.560 --> 04:30.720]  We did it.
[04:30.840 --> 04:31.600]  Nailed it.
[04:31.700 --> 04:32.460]  Easy peasy.
[04:32.620 --> 04:33.140]  Clear.
[04:38.700 --> 04:40.680]  Splooge McDuck with a gifted sub.
[04:40.800 --> 04:41.740]  You can name yourself anything.
[04:41.880 --> 04:42.700]  I love this site.
[04:45.480 --> 04:46.460]  Alright, resets.
[04:47.380 --> 04:48.340]  Oh, God.
[04:49.180 --> 04:50.420]  What was that?
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.060]  I think it flies out at us. Don't touch it.
[04:56.460 --> 04:57.660]  Oh, when you hit the key, maybe?
[04:58.280 --> 04:59.240]  Oh, when you jump.
[04:59.740 --> 05:00.820]  Oh, you jump.
[05:01.600 --> 05:02.240]  Well, don't jump.
[05:04.200 --> 05:06.820]  Should we move and see what's to the right first?
[05:07.160 --> 05:07.620]  Yeah, sure.
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.480]  Alright, give it a shot, Nick.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.920]  Ooh, that kills you.
[05:15.180 --> 05:17.020]  It definitely said don't press.
[05:17.520 --> 05:18.620]  I mean, it says don't press that.
[05:18.660 --> 05:20.520]  We were a little tight right there. A little tight.
[05:21.280 --> 05:22.940]  To what? Pressing the button?
[05:23.620 --> 05:26.000]  No, just I didn't have enough lead up space to run.
[05:26.260 --> 05:28.040]  Oh, that's what was going on.
[05:28.640 --> 05:29.000]  Whoa.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Oh, you know what? It wasn't.
[05:31.220 --> 05:31.520]  Did you get rid of it?
[05:31.920 --> 05:33.140]  Yeah, I think you got rid of it.
[05:33.160 --> 05:35.560]  I think maybe like one vertical jump there.
[05:36.460 --> 05:37.980]  Yeah, just jump up and down.
[05:39.520 --> 05:39.780]  There you go.
[05:39.960 --> 05:42.160]  Oh, then we get the key, huh?
[05:42.160 --> 05:42.880]  Yeah, okay.
[05:43.400 --> 05:45.620]  And then I can jump on someone's head.
[05:46.600 --> 05:49.440]  What did you think was going to happen?
[05:49.620 --> 05:52.280]  I thought I could jump over it, but I couldn't.
[05:54.220 --> 05:55.740]  Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:56.380 --> 05:57.540]  Nice, jump on it.
[05:57.660 --> 05:58.280]  Now we got to go back?
[05:59.180 --> 06:02.980]  So then I think we have to make a stack and walk over it.
[06:03.160 --> 06:04.400]  Like, we do this.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.080]  All the way.
[06:07.420 --> 06:09.520]  Oh, but won't Nick die pressing it?
[06:10.140 --> 06:11.380]  No, because I'm not going to press it.
[06:11.380 --> 06:12.920]  We're just going to walk slightly to the right.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.220]  Because purple's going to go almost all the way.
[06:15.940 --> 06:17.460]  Should I be further over before we do it?
[06:17.700 --> 06:19.380]  Oh, okay, so it just launches. Got it.
[06:19.620 --> 06:21.240]  Why did it do that?
[06:21.420 --> 06:23.120]  I guess if we go over it, it'll shoot up.
[06:23.200 --> 06:25.620]  So we got to maybe edge it a little bit on the tower?
[06:26.600 --> 06:27.460]  Dude, I don't know.
[06:27.740 --> 06:29.180]  Got to edge it on the tower, alright.
[06:31.500 --> 06:34.060]  Dude, I am not sure.
[06:35.580 --> 06:36.160]  Ooh, ah!
[06:36.380 --> 06:37.140]  Oh, you had it.
[06:38.480 --> 06:38.800]  Ah!
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.340]  It just doesn't...
[06:40.340 --> 06:40.560]  Oh!
[06:40.860 --> 06:41.300]  What?
[06:41.940 --> 06:42.380]  Oh!
[06:45.740 --> 06:47.740]  So maybe if you go...
[06:47.740 --> 06:49.280]  I have to give you credit, that was pretty impressive.
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.420]  Maybe if you stack three...
[06:52.140 --> 06:52.580]  What?
[06:52.880 --> 06:55.560]  I take back everything I fucking said.
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.280]  Hold on, hold on.
[06:56.880 --> 06:59.020]  I was just hitting A to start game.
[06:59.940 --> 07:00.680]  Do you press A?
[07:01.320 --> 07:01.760]  No.
[07:02.040 --> 07:02.820]  You don't have to.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.880]  Turns out, you don't.
[07:04.100 --> 07:06.340]  So wait, if I go up here...
[07:07.860 --> 07:09.520]  Dude, I don't...
[07:09.520 --> 07:10.420]  Go one higher.
[07:10.720 --> 07:12.960]  You can edge it better higher, right?
[07:13.320 --> 07:15.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't want to get hit by accident.
[07:15.860 --> 07:17.420]  I think you got to go...
[07:17.420 --> 07:18.420]  Ooh, that was almost it.
[07:18.600 --> 07:19.520]  It was almost it.
[07:19.620 --> 07:20.260]  It was almost it.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.120]  This is tough.
[07:21.960 --> 07:25.760]  I think we go less staircase there and like straight up.
[07:26.180 --> 07:27.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[07:27.480 --> 07:27.660]  Okay.
[07:28.280 --> 07:29.240]  Alright, hop on, boys.
[07:31.880 --> 07:32.620]  Oh, we stair... okay.
[07:33.280 --> 07:33.960]  Not staircasing.
[07:34.120 --> 07:34.980]  We got to staircase to get out of here.
[07:35.680 --> 07:36.600]  Yeah, then we...
[07:37.580 --> 07:38.020]  Okay.
[07:38.580 --> 07:39.940]  So where do you want me to go?
[07:39.980 --> 07:40.480]  I'm at the bottom.
[07:40.760 --> 07:41.340]  Am I good here?
[07:41.420 --> 07:42.040]  You want me to get closer?
[07:42.800 --> 07:42.980]  Yes.
[07:43.660 --> 07:44.620]  What does that...
[07:44.620 --> 07:45.540]  A little bit closer.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.520]  A little bit closer.
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.000]  A little bit closer.
[07:47.180 --> 07:47.500]  Closer.
[07:47.680 --> 07:47.900]  Closer.
[07:47.940 --> 07:48.160]  There you go.
[07:48.320 --> 07:48.540]  Closer.
[07:48.920 --> 07:51.100]  Now, Gavin, make sure that you're not touching it.
[07:52.160 --> 07:53.500]  Okay, I think that's good.
[07:54.340 --> 07:54.560]  Yeah.
[07:54.760 --> 07:55.080]  Yeah.
[07:55.380 --> 07:56.380]  Should be close, but good.
[07:56.440 --> 07:58.080]  Is it going to be Nick jumping it?
[07:58.160 --> 07:59.920]  Yeah, it has to be the person on the top.
[08:00.400 --> 08:01.920]  But am I jumping over or coming back?
[08:02.620 --> 08:04.400]  I think you probably come back, right?
[08:04.400 --> 08:05.900]  I think you have to, right?
[08:05.940 --> 08:06.980]  Because I think you're trying to trick it.
[08:06.980 --> 08:07.320]  Oh, God.
[08:07.460 --> 08:07.640]  Yeah.
[08:08.040 --> 08:08.320]  Oh, God.
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.380]  Maybe just...
[08:09.380 --> 08:10.120]  Maybe try going over.
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.320]  No, it's too far.
[08:12.540 --> 08:14.120]  Adrian Griff, thank you for the subs.
[08:14.320 --> 08:14.900]  Appreciate you.
[08:18.060 --> 08:19.080]  I hit the wrong button.
[08:19.500 --> 08:19.700]  See?
[08:19.920 --> 08:20.040]  See?
[08:20.220 --> 08:20.500]  See?
[08:20.680 --> 08:21.580]  It's not so easy.
[08:21.600 --> 08:24.060]  Well, what happened was I was hitting A to start.
[08:24.560 --> 08:24.800]  Right.
[08:25.740 --> 08:27.620]  Listen, you're preaching to the choir.
[08:27.900 --> 08:28.320]  Yeah, man.
[08:28.640 --> 08:30.320]  Me and you hitting A to start for some reason.
[08:30.740 --> 08:32.280]  Well, it's a game tradition.
[08:33.520 --> 08:34.320]  Game trope.
[08:36.020 --> 08:36.580]  Come on over, boys.
[08:40.100 --> 08:40.820]  Can you...
[08:40.820 --> 08:41.260]  All right.
[08:43.160 --> 08:43.880]  I don't...
[08:43.880 --> 08:44.240]  Oh!
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.760]  Okay, hardest we've ever been.
[08:46.920 --> 08:48.960]  All right, everyone get off of him.
[08:49.460 --> 08:49.580]  Yeah.
[08:50.420 --> 08:52.040]  What do you think the trick is to this one?
[08:52.060 --> 08:52.520]  Don't press.
[08:52.680 --> 08:53.960]  Probably don't press it.
[08:54.200 --> 08:54.740]  Don't press it.
[08:54.740 --> 08:55.900]  Is it going to shoot up though, do you think?
[08:56.400 --> 08:56.760]  Oh, yeah.
[08:57.120 --> 08:57.860]  Should I try to edge it?
[08:58.300 --> 08:58.480]  Yeah.
[08:58.760 --> 08:59.720]  Yeah, try to edge it.
[09:00.340 --> 09:00.900]  Tease it a little.
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.080]  So we got to do this.
[09:05.340 --> 09:05.700]  Oh!
[09:06.540 --> 09:07.620]  Oh, it doesn't go as high.
[09:08.380 --> 09:11.660]  This is the one where we have to stack and the top person goes over.
[09:12.180 --> 09:13.680]  But then how do we all get there?
[09:15.120 --> 09:15.440]  Maybe...
[09:17.540 --> 09:19.380]  Maybe it jumps back based on that.
[09:19.440 --> 09:19.920]  Let's get the key.
[09:20.840 --> 09:21.440]  Great idea.
[09:21.960 --> 09:22.300]  Good thinking.
[09:27.740 --> 09:28.960]  Honestly, by the end, we won't...
[09:28.960 --> 09:30.740]  I mean, we can just walk back and get the key.
[09:30.800 --> 09:31.760]  All the bullshit will be gone.
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.020]  Purple, get closer.
[09:33.220 --> 09:34.280]  Let me get you closer.
[09:37.340 --> 09:38.360]  You want a hair closer?
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:40.860 --> 09:43.300]  It's not even moving on my screen.
[09:43.720 --> 09:44.620]  Oh, it is on my screen.
[09:46.520 --> 09:48.420]  Okay, so we have to stack up.
[09:48.860 --> 09:49.800]  Let me get back on top.
[09:50.120 --> 09:50.620]  Oh, sorry.
[09:51.580 --> 09:52.840]  Alright, there you go.
[09:53.120 --> 09:54.480]  Andrew, all the way to the top.
[09:54.960 --> 09:56.840]  Andrew, I think you're going to walk over.
[09:57.260 --> 09:57.540]  Okay.
[09:58.040 --> 09:58.900]  And then you're going to open the door.
[10:00.440 --> 10:01.940]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[10:01.980 --> 10:04.960]  We have to not be so stair-stacked.
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.920]  If we're straight up and down stack, we'll be fine.
[10:11.460 --> 10:12.560]  Why did you do that?
[10:13.020 --> 10:14.100]  Well, I landed on you.
[10:14.160 --> 10:15.420]  Yeah, he landed on your head.
[10:15.800 --> 10:16.560]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[10:16.660 --> 10:17.380]  Why did you jump?
[10:17.960 --> 10:19.200]  To get rid of that.
[10:19.640 --> 10:20.980]  So we have to wait for the key.
[10:21.460 --> 10:22.340]  A lot of purple deaths.
[10:22.600 --> 10:23.040]  Uh-huh.
[10:23.200 --> 10:24.260]  Yeah, a lot of purple deaths.
[10:24.700 --> 10:27.620]  Mark the Frog is helping people with their HVAC systems in the chat.
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.640]  So if you have HVAC questions, hit up Mark the Frog.
[10:30.160 --> 10:30.340]  Sweet.
[10:30.600 --> 10:30.940]  Gavin, you're going to...
[10:30.940 --> 10:31.360]  Nice.
[10:32.260 --> 10:33.420]  Okay, alright, let's stair-stack.
[10:33.500 --> 10:33.960]  Let's stair-stack.
[10:33.960 --> 10:35.020]  Come straight up and down.
[10:35.540 --> 10:35.840]  Andrew?
[10:36.360 --> 10:36.480]  Yep.
[10:36.620 --> 10:37.640]  There you go, there you go.
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.220]  And then, Geoff, you're going to jump all the way across and you're going to open that door.
[10:42.000 --> 10:42.780]  Alright, I'll do it.
[10:43.380 --> 10:43.740]  There you go.
[10:44.660 --> 10:45.980]  Blue is going to go all the way across.
[10:46.580 --> 10:48.340]  What about that button over there?
[10:48.560 --> 10:49.400]  What do you think that button does?
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.860]  I think the button's going to kill us, isn't it?
[10:51.020 --> 10:52.960]  Oh yeah, it's the button that went across, left to right.
[10:53.140 --> 10:53.600]  Oh, hang on.
[10:54.000 --> 10:54.780]  Oh, there we go.
[10:54.880 --> 10:55.660]  Okay, okay.
[10:55.860 --> 10:57.540]  So if you can move it, then purple go across.
[10:58.460 --> 10:58.640]  Okay.
[10:59.240 --> 11:00.060]  Well, you're going to go under?
[11:00.460 --> 11:02.700]  Yeah, you should go under, so you guys got to time it.
[11:02.700 --> 11:05.060]  Why don't the other two go over while they...
[11:05.060 --> 11:05.640]  Oh, I guess you're right.
[11:05.880 --> 11:07.360]  You're a fucking psycho.
[11:07.700 --> 11:08.640]  Alright, so I'm going to go...
[11:08.640 --> 11:09.920]  This is a drill.
[11:10.280 --> 11:12.180]  One, two, three, jump.
[11:12.440 --> 11:12.600]  Like that.
[11:12.640 --> 11:12.960]  Got it.
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.780]  One, two, three, jump.
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.800]  I think it was a little late on that.
[11:22.240 --> 11:23.340]  Well, felt like it.
[11:28.060 --> 11:29.780]  Well, don't be the third...
[11:29.780 --> 11:31.300]  Why are you third in line jumping?
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.200]  What are you thinking?
[11:32.200 --> 11:33.180]  Well, I survived.
[11:33.520 --> 11:34.220]  Is what I'm thinking.
[11:34.620 --> 11:35.000]  I lived.
[11:35.780 --> 11:36.640]  Clearly, it worked.
[11:37.580 --> 11:38.920]  You know when he's right, he's right.
[11:39.100 --> 11:40.180]  This is going to kill us.
[11:44.170 --> 11:45.590]  Are you going to leave me ever a bit more?
[11:47.710 --> 11:48.550]  There you go.
[11:52.790 --> 11:53.510]  Alright, go ahead.
[11:54.530 --> 11:55.410]  Okay, here I come.
[11:55.590 --> 11:57.330]  Okay, how do we want to do this?
[12:00.550 --> 12:01.290]  You want to time it?
[12:02.370 --> 12:03.550]  I'm good whenever you got...
[12:03.550 --> 12:05.350]  If you start running at it...
[12:05.350 --> 12:06.410]  If everyone starts way back...
[12:07.010 --> 12:08.130]  If everyone starts way back...
[12:08.130 --> 12:09.190]  Okay, I'm not going to stop.
[12:09.250 --> 12:10.110]  I'm not going to stop running.
[12:10.490 --> 12:12.210]  Okay, everyone starts way back.
[12:13.190 --> 12:14.250]  I'm not going to stop running.
[12:14.890 --> 12:15.550]  What is this?
[12:15.650 --> 12:16.750]  I couldn't be further back.
[12:16.910 --> 12:17.110]  Ready?
[12:17.570 --> 12:19.410]  The only person who isn't is the guy who's closest.
[12:19.550 --> 12:20.050]  Yeah, let's go.
[12:21.850 --> 12:22.210]  Perfect.
[12:25.250 --> 12:25.770]  You ready?
[12:25.990 --> 12:26.990]  What are you doing?
[12:26.990 --> 12:27.730]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[12:28.070 --> 12:29.250]  Just trust him.
[12:29.310 --> 12:30.410]  Get the fuck out of here.
[12:30.550 --> 12:30.790]  Go in the door.
[12:30.830 --> 12:31.630]  I'm going to trust him.
[12:31.650 --> 12:32.390]  I'm waiting for them to go.
[12:32.470 --> 12:33.210]  Just trust him and run.
[12:33.210 --> 12:33.690]  Geoff, you're fine.
[12:33.750 --> 12:34.190]  Geoff, no!
[12:39.150 --> 12:40.010]  Put that on Nick.
[12:40.190 --> 12:40.650]  Thank you.
[12:40.750 --> 12:41.070]  Why?
[12:41.410 --> 12:42.730]  Why the fuck would you do that?
[12:42.830 --> 12:43.290]  Why didn't...
[12:43.290 --> 12:44.810]  I was told to trust.
[12:45.130 --> 12:45.690]  I trusted.
[12:45.970 --> 12:48.130]  I'm trying to get these two dipshits in the door.
[12:48.470 --> 12:49.630]  Why does it matter if we're in the door?
[12:49.750 --> 12:50.630]  It doesn't change anything.
[12:51.050 --> 12:51.890]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[12:52.090 --> 12:54.070]  Because I don't trust you morons.
[12:54.290 --> 12:56.530]  I think the person you should trust is you, clearly.
[12:57.030 --> 12:57.950]  You're the reason that it failed.
[12:57.950 --> 12:59.650]  I was proved right.
[13:00.030 --> 13:01.330]  You were proved that you couldn't trust yourself?
[13:01.330 --> 13:02.610]  You were proved that you're the fool.
[13:02.790 --> 13:03.590]  I appreciate it.
[13:03.590 --> 13:03.650]  The fool.
[13:03.670 --> 13:04.490]  Thank you so much.
[13:04.490 --> 13:05.010]  The foolest fool.
[13:05.410 --> 13:05.690]  Alright, go ahead.
[13:05.830 --> 13:06.310]  Go ahead, Nick.
[13:06.470 --> 13:07.070]  What a fool.
[13:07.110 --> 13:08.150]  Remember, you could do this.
[13:08.990 --> 13:09.470]  That's true.
[13:10.130 --> 13:10.930]  Oh, I had a system.
[13:11.030 --> 13:11.610]  The system worked.
[13:12.270 --> 13:12.950]  The system worked.
[13:13.170 --> 13:15.590]  And then Nick was hanging out.
[13:16.130 --> 13:17.650]  I fucking stood there.
[13:18.370 --> 13:19.050]  I'm going over.
[13:21.210 --> 13:21.770]  Oh, look.
[13:21.790 --> 13:22.410]  The door's not open.
[13:22.490 --> 13:23.390]  I guess I'll just stand here.
[13:23.570 --> 13:24.090]  You go over.
[13:24.430 --> 13:26.510]  No, you're going to kill us all, Nick, by doing that.
[13:26.610 --> 13:27.210]  Green, go over.
[13:27.310 --> 13:28.510]  No, Nick's going to solve it.
[13:28.950 --> 13:29.750]  Green, go over.
[13:30.110 --> 13:30.530]  Jump, Green.
[13:32.130 --> 13:32.610]  There you go.
[13:32.990 --> 13:34.630]  I would love to trust this.
[13:35.030 --> 13:35.770]  How do we do that now?
[13:35.930 --> 13:37.330]  We need a jumper.
[13:37.790 --> 13:38.250]  Okay, Nick.
[13:38.350 --> 13:38.870]  You time it.
[13:39.690 --> 13:40.550]  Yeah, we'll do the same thing.
[13:40.650 --> 13:40.890]  Start running.
[13:41.230 --> 13:41.770]  Gavin, you first.
[13:42.410 --> 13:42.730]  Okay.
[13:42.830 --> 13:43.510]  Let me see how it goes.
[13:43.590 --> 13:43.730]  Okay.
[13:45.130 --> 13:45.930]  Just don't stop running.
[13:46.650 --> 13:47.170]  Yeah, just run.
[13:47.970 --> 13:48.330]  Here we go.
[13:51.310 --> 13:52.010]  I was late.
[13:58.130 --> 13:59.370]  I hate to stop.
[13:59.790 --> 14:00.430]  I hate to stop.
[14:00.430 --> 14:01.770]  This is...
[14:02.890 --> 14:04.110]  I hate to start.
[14:05.030 --> 14:06.430]  Why are we all over here?
[14:07.450 --> 14:07.970]  God!
[14:08.510 --> 14:09.650]  What are you doing?
[14:10.410 --> 14:11.430]  This is...
[14:12.250 --> 14:14.590]  Nick is acting like it's Mario Party turn 20.
[14:16.310 --> 14:17.590]  Yeah, just turn 20.
[14:19.950 --> 14:21.010]  Just turn 20.
[14:21.050 --> 14:22.710]  Anyway, tune into that at the end of the month.
[14:23.030 --> 14:23.130]  Okay.
[14:23.670 --> 14:24.810]  Getting a good stack, Ellen.
[14:25.250 --> 14:26.230]  This is incredible.
[14:26.910 --> 14:28.650]  This is so fucking incredible.
[14:28.650 --> 14:30.010]  Oh, God.
[14:32.570 --> 14:33.550]  Gavin, go back.
[14:33.730 --> 14:34.490]  Yeah, Gavin, go back.
[14:34.490 --> 14:34.790]  There you go.
[14:34.830 --> 14:35.130]  Thank you.
[14:35.690 --> 14:36.450]  Sucking my gut.
[14:36.930 --> 14:37.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:37.490 --> 14:37.890]  Just a little.
[14:38.230 --> 14:39.090]  Oh, shit.
[14:39.830 --> 14:40.050]  Goddamn.
[14:40.050 --> 14:40.290]  Sticey.
[14:40.410 --> 14:40.790]  Sticey.
[14:40.890 --> 14:41.870]  That is fucking tough.
[14:42.650 --> 14:43.170]  I hate to stop.
[14:43.850 --> 14:46.990]  It's a shame because we've beaten that part so many times at this point.
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.220]  There we go.
[14:51.660 --> 14:53.640]  I'll walk it back when we're all there.
[14:55.000 --> 14:55.740]  You got it, Nick.
[14:56.220 --> 14:56.500]  Here we go.
[14:56.740 --> 14:57.220]  All right.
[14:57.260 --> 14:57.400]  Ready?
[14:57.400 --> 14:57.520]  All right.
[15:00.240 --> 15:00.600]  Nice.
[15:01.680 --> 15:02.160]  Good job, Nick.
[15:02.160 --> 15:03.360]  The noise he makes is so funny.
[15:03.420 --> 15:03.680]  There you go.
[15:06.060 --> 15:06.780]  Holy shit.
[15:10.940 --> 15:11.220]  All right.
[15:11.260 --> 15:12.440]  We'll just keep running it along.
[15:12.900 --> 15:13.640]  Ready, Geoff?
[15:15.960 --> 15:16.320]  Go.
[15:18.540 --> 15:18.900]  Nice.
[15:19.020 --> 15:19.620]  Okay, here I come.
[15:21.480 --> 15:21.960]  Thank you.
[15:21.980 --> 15:22.520]  Here I come.
[15:23.380 --> 15:24.740]  Oh, beautiful, Geoff.
[15:25.000 --> 15:25.300]  Good job, Geoff.
[15:25.300 --> 15:26.860]  Geoff, you're the best player at this game.
[15:27.700 --> 15:28.480]  The redemption.
[15:29.240 --> 15:30.620]  You're the best player at this game.
[15:30.680 --> 15:32.520]  I just want to show you guys what trust is.
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.020]  Hey, man.
[15:33.100 --> 15:33.420]  That's it.
[15:34.160 --> 15:34.900]  Way to go.
[15:35.160 --> 15:35.840]  Shouts out, Geoff.
[15:40.550 --> 15:40.950]  Okay.
[15:41.390 --> 15:42.790]  I'm, like, scared to move.
[15:43.170 --> 15:43.330]  Yeah.
[15:43.850 --> 15:44.770]  A bullet bill coming.
[15:45.230 --> 15:45.670]  Yeah, definitely.
[15:46.250 --> 15:46.630]  All right.
[15:49.290 --> 15:49.690]  Let's...
[15:50.290 --> 15:50.690]  Oh!
[15:52.930 --> 15:53.330]  Whoa.
[15:53.650 --> 15:54.270]  What did you do there?
[15:54.770 --> 15:55.830]  So, what?
[15:56.590 --> 15:57.690]  Can we keep those in frame and all?
[15:57.690 --> 15:57.970]  Can we keep those in frame and all?
[15:58.170 --> 15:58.350]  Yeah.
[15:58.350 --> 15:59.630]  Only one person died.
[16:01.270 --> 16:02.790]  Here, say right, maybe?
[16:03.410 --> 16:03.970]  We can't.
[16:03.970 --> 16:04.990]  Should I jump on this?
[16:05.430 --> 16:06.210]  Here, I'll tell you...
[16:06.210 --> 16:06.350]  Oh.
[16:06.670 --> 16:07.870]  We have to go up.
[16:08.950 --> 16:09.390]  I...
[16:09.390 --> 16:09.970]  Oh, yeah.
[16:10.010 --> 16:11.470]  Maybe give us a second to think about it.
[16:11.550 --> 16:11.990]  You think so?
[16:12.250 --> 16:13.330]  I think we're teasing it, yeah.
[16:13.830 --> 16:14.130]  Okay.
[16:15.110 --> 16:17.250]  I think it's just knowing when to get off.
[16:20.910 --> 16:21.750]  Oh, my God.
[16:21.770 --> 16:23.370]  I don't think teasing it works, guys.
[16:23.890 --> 16:24.870]  I got a...
[16:24.870 --> 16:28.650]  I was standing there and I just got fucking cannon foddered.
[16:28.650 --> 16:31.590]  What if we make a stack and tease it with our heads?
[16:32.510 --> 16:32.610]  Oh!
[16:33.790 --> 16:34.510]  He's got a...
[16:34.510 --> 16:35.950]  It's not a bad idea.
[16:36.210 --> 16:37.810]  Yeah, it's just the way he said it is really interesting.
[16:37.810 --> 16:38.150]  You mean over here?
[16:38.470 --> 16:39.730]  Yeah, just like by the front.
[16:40.090 --> 16:40.370]  Yeah.
[16:41.050 --> 16:42.350]  See if we can get it teased.
[16:42.770 --> 16:46.490]  Well, maybe tease it closer to the thing so we have an extra time to avoid it, though.
[16:46.650 --> 16:46.890]  Yeah.
[16:47.510 --> 16:48.090]  Good thinking.
[16:48.930 --> 16:49.550]  So, go right.
[16:49.710 --> 16:50.090]  Go right.
[16:51.510 --> 16:52.230]  And then...
[16:52.230 --> 16:52.470]  Okay.
[16:53.350 --> 16:54.450]  So, you're gonna tease it.
[16:54.590 --> 16:54.930]  Oh!
[16:55.410 --> 16:55.650]  Okay.
[16:55.730 --> 16:55.930]  Whoa.
[16:58.150 --> 16:58.490]  Interesting.
[16:58.490 --> 16:58.970]  That'll work.
[16:59.950 --> 17:00.670]  Yeah, that'll work.
[17:02.250 --> 17:03.730]  Okay, so let's stack on...
[17:03.730 --> 17:04.330]  Yeah, there we go.
[17:04.770 --> 17:04.970]  Okay.
[17:05.650 --> 17:08.250]  Honestly, I think do four and I'll jump.
[17:08.430 --> 17:09.110]  Don't even get up here.
[17:09.350 --> 17:09.750]  Jump tease.
[17:11.110 --> 17:12.050]  Oh, did that not...
[17:12.050 --> 17:12.690]  It didn't trigger it?
[17:12.930 --> 17:14.810]  No, I think it's gonna be five.
[17:17.690 --> 17:19.290]  We could potentially do it on the platform.
[17:19.470 --> 17:20.710]  That might be the height difference we need.
[17:22.190 --> 17:22.530]  Oh!
[17:22.670 --> 17:23.610]  With the four, yeah, yeah.
[17:23.610 --> 17:24.550]  Let's do four on the...
[17:24.550 --> 17:25.430]  With four, yeah, yeah.
[17:25.430 --> 17:26.250]  Let's do that.
[17:26.470 --> 17:27.210]  Good idea.
[17:30.150 --> 17:30.470]  Yup.
[17:30.650 --> 17:31.170]  Yeah, that'll work.
[17:31.370 --> 17:32.110]  This is gonna be it.
[17:32.110 --> 17:32.450]  Oh, that's...
[17:32.450 --> 17:32.790]  Good job.
[17:32.830 --> 17:34.330]  But what do we...
[17:34.850 --> 17:35.170]  Hmm.
[17:36.290 --> 17:36.570]  So, we just...
[17:36.570 --> 17:37.670]  Maybe even further to the right.
[17:37.690 --> 17:39.090]  Let's just be further all the way to the right.
[17:39.610 --> 17:39.870]  Mm-hmm.
[17:41.090 --> 17:41.670]  Except for...
[17:41.670 --> 17:42.170]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:42.370 --> 17:42.830]  There we go.
[17:45.790 --> 17:46.110]  Ooh!
[17:48.090 --> 17:48.730]  Nice tease!
[17:49.630 --> 17:50.010]  All right.
[17:50.150 --> 17:50.670]  Good job, fellas.
[17:50.730 --> 17:50.970]  Wow.
[17:51.250 --> 17:51.970]  All right, hang on, hang on.
[17:53.430 --> 17:53.750]  Remember...
[17:53.750 --> 17:54.250]  Okay, let's go.
[17:54.630 --> 17:54.890]  Nope.
[17:55.110 --> 17:55.510]  Oh, shit.
[17:55.570 --> 17:55.970]  For the love of...
[17:55.970 --> 17:56.650]  Get back on the...
[17:58.430 --> 17:58.950]  Everybody go a little fast.
[17:58.950 --> 18:00.770]  Do we wanna just make a tower here?
[18:00.970 --> 18:01.890]  No, then we can just run it off.
[18:02.130 --> 18:02.450]  Okay.
[18:03.110 --> 18:04.450]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:04.890 --> 18:05.150]  Yeah.
[18:05.470 --> 18:07.110]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:07.530 --> 18:08.930]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:09.510 --> 18:09.830]  The front guy has to go front.
[18:09.830 --> 18:10.070]  All right, ready?
[18:10.510 --> 18:10.750]  Yup.
[18:11.010 --> 18:11.430]  One, two, three, go!
[18:13.810 --> 18:14.130]  Andrew.
[18:14.450 --> 18:15.090]  There's no room.
[18:15.770 --> 18:16.330]  You could...
[18:16.330 --> 18:16.970]  Well, you might have to...
[18:16.970 --> 18:18.350]  I didn't wanna drop down and kill us.
[18:22.030 --> 18:22.350]  Okay.
[18:22.370 --> 18:22.590]  Okay.
[18:22.630 --> 18:22.850]  All right.
[18:22.850 --> 18:24.810]  I'm gonna drop down and just see what happens.
[18:25.250 --> 18:25.530]  All right.
[18:25.570 --> 18:26.630]  You've killed us!
[18:27.710 --> 18:28.150]  Okay.
[18:28.490 --> 18:29.190]  All right.
[18:29.490 --> 18:30.370]  So far...
[18:30.370 --> 18:30.670]  Nice.
[18:32.550 --> 18:33.870]  You killed us!
[18:35.450 --> 18:36.730]  What did you do there?
[18:38.950 --> 18:40.450]  Do you think we can bullet bill it?
[18:43.090 --> 18:44.730]  Can you jump on top of it, do you think?
[18:46.530 --> 18:47.410]  Oh, shit.
[18:47.730 --> 18:48.570]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[18:48.770 --> 18:50.030]  We have to goomba stomp it, you mean?
[18:50.410 --> 18:50.810]  Yeah.
[18:50.870 --> 18:51.170]  Oh, my God.
[18:51.170 --> 18:51.710]  How?
[18:52.190 --> 18:53.170]  You think we goomba it?
[18:53.830 --> 18:54.030]  Maybe.
[18:54.290 --> 18:55.390]  How else would we avoid it, though?
[18:55.550 --> 18:55.690]  Okay.
[18:55.850 --> 18:55.930]  I don't know.
[18:56.430 --> 18:59.730]  That was a very legitimate scream by me.
[19:01.210 --> 19:02.290]  Blue, there you go.
[19:03.230 --> 19:03.470]  Yeah.
[19:04.350 --> 19:05.410]  Okay, here we go.
[19:05.530 --> 19:05.850]  And it's wet!
[19:06.370 --> 19:06.870]  Okay, nice.
[19:07.110 --> 19:07.890]  Nicely done.
[19:08.050 --> 19:08.290]  All right.
[19:08.370 --> 19:08.610]  Thank you.
[19:09.710 --> 19:12.930]  I'll be the one to cause bullet bill to come after us.
[19:13.550 --> 19:14.490]  We're gonna have to do it again.
[19:18.940 --> 19:20.300]  We can just go straight over.
[19:20.800 --> 19:20.960]  Yup.
[19:21.460 --> 19:22.900]  So do we want to be in a stack?
[19:23.720 --> 19:25.020]  A pre-stack?
[19:25.880 --> 19:26.520]  I don't...
[19:26.520 --> 19:29.080]  I think somebody has to stay up here and jump on him.
[19:30.100 --> 19:30.460]  Right?
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.220]  Oh, I see.
[19:31.220 --> 19:31.320]  I agree.
[19:31.800 --> 19:32.580]  That's a good idea.
[19:32.740 --> 19:32.920]  The goomba.
[19:32.980 --> 19:33.420]  Okay, Gavin.
[19:33.680 --> 19:34.480]  We'd have to be about...
[19:34.480 --> 19:35.520]  We'll just run back.
[19:35.640 --> 19:36.180]  We'll just run with you here a little bit.
[19:36.240 --> 19:36.320]  Yeah.
[19:39.620 --> 19:39.980]  Ah!
[19:41.880 --> 19:42.240]  That's it!
[19:42.240 --> 19:42.580]  Oh, it does!
[19:42.900 --> 19:43.100]  Okay.
[19:43.100 --> 19:43.180]  That's it.
[19:43.940 --> 19:44.620]  That's goomba.
[19:44.660 --> 19:46.260]  One person has to go down there.
[19:46.500 --> 19:47.300]  One poor bastard.
[19:47.420 --> 19:47.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.920]  One poor son of a bitch.
[19:50.020 --> 19:50.840]  I'll go down there.
[19:50.860 --> 19:51.600]  I really don't mind.
[19:51.780 --> 19:53.200]  Probably shouldn't be somebody with a hat.
[19:53.880 --> 19:54.280]  Uh...
[19:54.280 --> 19:54.780]  Wow.
[19:54.780 --> 19:56.520]  Well, you know, I guess that...
[19:56.520 --> 19:57.540]  Alright, I'll go down.
[19:57.980 --> 19:58.420]  Are you sure?
[19:58.900 --> 19:59.640]  Yeah, look...
[19:59.640 --> 19:59.700]  Wait!
[20:00.020 --> 20:00.240]  Okay.
[20:00.440 --> 20:01.520]  Alright, sounds good, man.
[20:01.660 --> 20:02.380]  Alright, go for it.
[20:03.120 --> 20:04.180]  Whenever you're ready, man.
[20:04.900 --> 20:05.300]  Gavin!
[20:05.600 --> 20:06.260]  Build the tower!
[20:06.540 --> 20:07.100]  Build the tower!
[20:07.480 --> 20:07.980]  You got it.
[20:08.560 --> 20:09.280]  Oh, what happened?
[20:09.860 --> 20:10.740]  I was too keen.
[20:11.060 --> 20:11.680]  Gavin, what happened?
[20:12.060 --> 20:13.400]  He's really excited about it.
[20:14.980 --> 20:16.560]  You abandoned us to die!
[20:16.560 --> 20:18.240]  He really wanted to do it.
[20:21.600 --> 20:22.320]  Oh, alright.
[20:26.580 --> 20:27.320]  Alright, we should...
[20:28.960 --> 20:30.540]  What are you guys doing?
[20:30.800 --> 20:31.440]  Now it's easy.
[20:31.540 --> 20:32.160]  Now I don't have to do it.
[20:32.220 --> 20:33.320]  Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[20:33.360 --> 20:33.460]  Stop.
[20:34.160 --> 20:34.820]  Okay, go left.
[20:34.920 --> 20:35.640]  I'll go get him.
[20:36.120 --> 20:38.060]  Who's gonna jump on top of...
[20:38.060 --> 20:38.740]  I'll jump on him.
[20:38.800 --> 20:39.460]  I'll jump on him.
[20:39.540 --> 20:41.220]  I think somebody needs to be on top of Geoff.
[20:41.220 --> 20:42.540]  Do we need to do a tower?
[20:42.860 --> 20:43.120]  Red, do it.
[20:43.240 --> 20:44.760]  Red can do it.
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.520]  You wanna make a tower so we can extend further beyond the platform?
[20:49.220 --> 20:52.000]  Well, it's gonna be Andrew on...
[20:52.000 --> 20:52.780]  Here, I'll do it.
[20:52.980 --> 20:54.020]  Alright, this is the jumping tower.
[20:54.500 --> 20:55.620]  So you two just stay safe.
[20:56.680 --> 20:58.160]  Oh, I heard it, I heard it, I heard it.
[20:58.780 --> 20:59.140]  Yeah.
[20:59.460 --> 21:00.800]  You can hear it, it has a cue.
[21:00.800 --> 21:01.540]  I didn't hear him.
[21:01.580 --> 21:02.300]  What noise does it make?
[21:02.360 --> 21:02.880]  I'll turn my...
[21:03.660 --> 21:04.920]  I think it was like...
[21:04.920 --> 21:07.180]  So I think we need a four-person tower, yeah.
[21:13.480 --> 21:14.200]  I just...
[21:14.200 --> 21:15.640]  This is the easy part.
[21:16.680 --> 21:17.280]  Please, Red.
[21:18.280 --> 21:18.920]  Andrew, goddamn.
[21:19.720 --> 21:21.300]  Like, get your head in the fucking game.
[21:21.340 --> 21:21.820]  What are you doing?
[21:23.920 --> 21:24.240]  Surviving.
[21:25.240 --> 21:25.800]  Are you?
[21:26.120 --> 21:26.340]  Yep.
[21:26.600 --> 21:28.400]  He's thriving and surviving.
[21:28.660 --> 21:29.520]  Just walk us off, Red.
[21:30.860 --> 21:31.180]  Okay.
[21:32.020 --> 21:32.880]  Alright, it's gonna be me.
[21:33.180 --> 21:33.500]  Alright.
[21:34.340 --> 21:34.660]  Alright.
[21:35.280 --> 21:35.980]  Good luck, Geoff.
[21:36.100 --> 21:37.180]  Alright, let me know when you're ready.
[21:37.320 --> 21:37.980]  Alright, Andrew's jumping.
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.180]  We're ready.
[21:38.620 --> 21:40.560]  I think the purple could go a step out more.
[21:41.340 --> 21:41.740]  There you go.
[21:41.980 --> 21:42.260]  Okay.
[21:42.900 --> 21:43.740]  Do you want me to go a step out?
[21:43.900 --> 21:44.480]  Andrew, it's gonna be you.
[21:44.480 --> 21:45.800]  No, Andrew, it's gonna be you.
[21:45.920 --> 21:46.440]  Yeah, I'm listening.
[21:46.440 --> 21:47.880]  Just listen, listen.
[21:49.880 --> 21:51.260]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[21:52.960 --> 21:54.700]  Okay, so it has to be on the top as well.
[21:54.860 --> 21:56.380]  It can't be on like the front sliding face.
[22:04.700 --> 22:05.020]  Whoa!
[22:10.840 --> 22:12.640]  Okay, everyone was on my head the whole time.
[22:12.820 --> 22:13.420]  That runs down.
[22:13.900 --> 22:14.680]  Alright, Gavin, go ahead.
[22:17.160 --> 22:18.380]  Why'd you drop already?
[22:18.580 --> 22:19.880]  I thought people were coming up.
[22:20.560 --> 22:20.880]  Me too.
[22:21.360 --> 22:23.760]  We already have to get stacked up there.
[22:23.780 --> 22:24.360]  Yeah, let's just stack.
[22:24.360 --> 22:25.300]  Why don't we just walk off stacked?
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.600]  Makes it so much easier.
[22:26.600 --> 22:28.580]  That way this part never happens again.
[22:29.060 --> 22:30.080]  I'll just wait off the top.
[22:30.080 --> 22:30.220]  Why?
[22:31.520 --> 22:34.620]  Because every time I go up there, everybody else comes up.
[22:35.140 --> 22:35.600]  Alright, let's stack.
[22:35.600 --> 22:36.720]  How are we doing it with so few though?
[22:38.480 --> 22:38.880]  Skills.
[22:39.240 --> 22:40.240]  The thing was going up.
[22:41.500 --> 22:41.900]  Stack.
[22:43.820 --> 22:44.740]  Go, we got it from here.
[22:47.040 --> 22:47.480]  Okay.
[22:48.820 --> 22:50.200]  Geoff, you want to call it over again?
[22:51.360 --> 22:51.780]  No.
[22:52.260 --> 22:53.020]  I'll do it.
[22:53.640 --> 22:53.840]  Okay.
[22:54.880 --> 22:56.020]  You got it, Andrew?
[22:56.220 --> 22:56.540]  Yep.
[22:57.080 --> 22:57.280]  Okay.
[23:00.360 --> 23:00.900]  You're gone!
[23:05.040 --> 23:08.660]  I saw Andrew fall right down and I went, someone's got to do it.
[23:09.420 --> 23:11.040]  I died and Geoff did it.
[23:11.040 --> 23:14.400]  I tried to make a further jump because I didn't think he was going to make it.
[23:15.540 --> 23:16.580]  I think it was too fast.
[23:18.960 --> 23:19.560]  What are you doing?
[23:20.100 --> 23:20.490]  So, are we...
[23:22.820 --> 23:23.480]  What's wrong, Andrew?
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.600]  If you have a three stack, you can just jump.
[23:29.200 --> 23:30.340]  If you just jump, it'll work.
[23:33.060 --> 23:35.140]  I've been doing it as a three stack the last few times.
[23:35.280 --> 23:36.680]  Why are we off?
[23:37.680 --> 23:38.020]  There we go.
[23:38.020 --> 23:38.340]  Okay.
[23:42.560 --> 23:44.960]  Alright, who's going to be the lure?
[23:45.960 --> 23:47.160]  I could be the shmuck.
[23:48.360 --> 23:49.980]  Some other shmuck has to move. Okay.
[23:53.580 --> 23:55.600]  Alright, Andrew, remember, jump, not fall.
[23:56.200 --> 23:56.340]  Yep.
[23:59.160 --> 23:59.680]  There.
[24:03.960 --> 24:04.420]  Little late.
[24:04.720 --> 24:05.480]  Little late.
[24:06.120 --> 24:06.600]  Little late.
[24:07.540 --> 24:08.240]  Little late.
[24:09.160 --> 24:10.660]  That was on me. That was a little late.
[24:17.100 --> 24:19.880]  This front bit is a piece of piss now. I love it.
[24:24.140 --> 24:24.540]  Shit.
[24:26.080 --> 24:26.980]  Why are you...
[24:26.980 --> 24:27.960]  Why are you there?
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.200]  I wasn't sure if Gavin wanted to be the tease again.
[24:30.220 --> 24:30.840]  Andrew, why are you running around?
[24:31.520 --> 24:33.060]  No, no, no, I went back.
[24:33.100 --> 24:36.200]  I went back because I wasn't sure if Gavin wanted to be the tease.
[24:36.620 --> 24:37.180]  You ready?
[24:37.900 --> 24:38.300]  Yes.
[24:38.300 --> 24:39.680]  Alright, listen.
[24:43.250 --> 24:43.650]  Run!
[24:45.430 --> 24:45.830]  No!
[24:46.690 --> 24:47.870]  You saved me!
[24:48.170 --> 24:48.810]  Hell yeah.
[24:49.970 --> 24:51.570]  You saved me real good.
[24:51.650 --> 24:51.990]  Uh oh.
[24:53.630 --> 24:54.710]  I like pit.
[24:55.190 --> 24:56.430]  Is it like a little hide hole?
[24:56.810 --> 24:57.030]  Yeah.
[24:57.050 --> 24:57.810]  I think it's a hide hole.
[24:59.770 --> 25:01.350]  Alright, I'm going to jump and grab. Ready?
[25:01.450 --> 25:02.650]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:02.710 --> 25:04.550]  There's no way that it's just jump and grab.
[25:04.610 --> 25:05.270]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[25:05.290 --> 25:06.130]  Yeah, grab it. Let's just see.
[25:06.330 --> 25:06.610]  Do it.
[25:07.450 --> 25:07.850]  Oh.
[25:10.910 --> 25:11.310]  Uh...
[25:12.670 --> 25:13.070]  Andrew?
[25:13.890 --> 25:15.690]  I'm just nervous. I'm scared. I don't want to be...
[25:16.910 --> 25:17.210]  Okay.
[25:17.290 --> 25:18.130]  How did... Okay.
[25:18.470 --> 25:18.790]  Alright.
[25:19.690 --> 25:22.930]  Maybe if we'd stacked any higher there, it would have sent them.
[25:24.310 --> 25:24.710]  Probably.
[25:26.210 --> 25:29.850]  Somebody said, I like how they're happy, like they're not going to be jumping on that bullet again later.
[25:29.990 --> 25:30.430]  That's a good point.
[25:32.230 --> 25:34.310]  Well, not that exact bullet. We made that bit.
[25:34.410 --> 25:35.090]  Yeah, we killed that bullet.
[25:35.970 --> 25:36.650]  Oh, so...
[25:36.650 --> 25:36.970]  Get away from me.
[25:37.350 --> 25:37.950]  Three people.
[25:38.530 --> 25:40.730]  Get the fuck away from... Oh my god, Andrew.
[25:41.450 --> 25:42.270]  Like, what?
[25:42.570 --> 25:43.930]  Andrew, do you...
[25:43.930 --> 25:45.270]  We're just here testing. We're figuring it out.
[25:45.270 --> 25:47.310]  Are you just looking... Are you looking at like the bottom?
[25:47.330 --> 25:47.990]  Did you look up?
[25:48.190 --> 25:51.310]  I was just moving up. I was getting sick. Nobody was moving. We're all just standing still and there we go.
[25:51.610 --> 25:53.030]  Gavin tested as well.
[25:53.690 --> 25:55.690]  Now we definitely know, don't do that.
[25:55.970 --> 25:57.050]  Just go backwards.
[25:57.410 --> 25:58.090]  You gotta tease it a little bit.
[25:58.270 --> 26:00.950]  Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away from me.
[26:01.110 --> 26:03.950]  Okay, we'll go the other way. I'm going this way. I'm running right. You're going right?
[26:03.950 --> 26:05.150]  We're going to the same place.
[26:06.610 --> 26:07.730]  Here we go.
[26:08.730 --> 26:10.030]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[26:10.710 --> 26:10.850]  Here we go.
[26:10.850 --> 26:11.890]  Listen, I understand.
[26:14.490 --> 26:16.290]  Looks like we didn't understand.
[26:17.250 --> 26:17.770]  Wow.
[26:18.250 --> 26:22.810]  Alright, so we need someone to just stand at this and then they can push from my head.
[26:23.590 --> 26:24.110]  Okay.
[26:24.710 --> 26:28.450]  It looks like there's one underneath it as well.
[26:28.650 --> 26:29.370]  There is.
[26:30.450 --> 26:32.510]  It's a double red. I see the red sticking out.
[26:32.850 --> 26:32.870]  Yeah.
[26:33.950 --> 26:35.490]  The one that we just killed is who you mean?
[26:36.210 --> 26:36.410]  Yeah.
[26:38.150 --> 26:39.430]  That's why we died, isn't it?
[26:39.590 --> 26:40.610]  That's why we died the last time.
[26:40.610 --> 26:43.950]  Yeah, jump over it. Jump over it and go from the other side maybe.
[26:44.290 --> 26:47.290]  But I still need it. So we need to push from my...
[26:47.290 --> 26:47.950]  From where Eric is standing.
[26:47.950 --> 26:49.130]  Gavin needs to be touching it.
[26:50.690 --> 26:51.490]  And then...
[26:52.250 --> 26:53.350]  It's like this.
[26:54.050 --> 26:56.890]  But Gavin doesn't move. How do we do this?
[26:57.030 --> 26:58.710]  Gavin comes slightly to the left.
[26:58.890 --> 26:58.930]  Wait, Andrew, stand on top.
[27:01.650 --> 27:02.730]  Is this still two?
[27:03.090 --> 27:06.810]  Geoff, why didn't Geoff just push the back of us?
[27:07.050 --> 27:08.690]  Wait, if I'm pushing Gavin, it counts.
[27:09.130 --> 27:10.510]  Yeah, but isn't it going to kill Gavin?
[27:11.130 --> 27:11.350]  Yeah.
[27:11.430 --> 27:12.450]  Not if Gavin's not moving.
[27:12.490 --> 27:13.030]  I'm not moving.
[27:13.370 --> 27:15.310]  Yeah, but now I'm the only one put here.
[27:15.530 --> 27:17.170]  Geoff, get on top of me and walk.
[27:17.330 --> 27:20.250]  What if Andrew pushes the back of Eric? Or the front of Eric?
[27:22.570 --> 27:22.930]  Oh, there.
[27:25.090 --> 27:26.690]  We have to... No, no, no.
[27:26.890 --> 27:28.350]  Oh, is it? Do you think we'll make that?
[27:28.570 --> 27:29.430]  Yeah, try it.
[27:30.170 --> 27:30.410]  Yeah.
[27:30.650 --> 27:31.170]  Yeah, cool.
[27:31.170 --> 27:31.730]  Alright.
[27:32.810 --> 27:34.610]  Geoff, you have to keep going.
[27:37.330 --> 27:37.730]  Sorry.
[27:41.550 --> 27:42.350]  Okay, so...
[27:42.350 --> 27:44.390]  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[27:44.570 --> 27:45.550]  Yeah, I think it's gotta be that.
[27:45.550 --> 27:46.570]  Oh, that's a little red guy.
[27:47.730 --> 27:49.530]  Gavin got a red thing on top of the four.
[27:50.330 --> 27:51.230]  I don't see it at all.
[27:51.490 --> 27:53.890]  When he moved it, there's a red one under the one.
[27:54.350 --> 27:54.830]  Oh, is there?
[27:55.050 --> 27:55.270]  Yeah.
[27:55.890 --> 27:56.070]  Really?
[27:56.150 --> 27:57.530]  I didn't even see it.
[27:57.970 --> 27:58.730]  Should I be up here?
[27:58.730 --> 28:00.530]  Yeah, maybe go from the other side and see what happens.
[28:02.570 --> 28:04.150]  No, because we don't want to push it off, do we?
[28:04.430 --> 28:05.910]  I don't think we want it on this side.
[28:05.930 --> 28:09.430]  Why don't we just push forward just to see what happens?
[28:09.850 --> 28:10.050]  Yeah.
[28:12.570 --> 28:14.150]  Oh, is that gonna fall on you?
[28:14.210 --> 28:15.450]  Yeah, that'll probably fall.
[28:19.970 --> 28:20.530]  Okay, so...
[28:20.950 --> 28:22.010]  So, what do I do a little bit?
[28:22.370 --> 28:24.350]  Here, you three go forward and I'll X.
[28:27.190 --> 28:27.830]  It's not gonna fall.
[28:27.830 --> 28:29.770]  Are we sure about that?
[28:30.170 --> 28:31.090]  I think it's still on it.
[28:31.570 --> 28:32.930]  I think it is too, but we can try.
[28:33.150 --> 28:33.270]  Okay.
[28:33.930 --> 28:34.850]  Press A for boost.
[28:35.370 --> 28:37.270]  Okay, and that's the floor for the other side.
[28:37.450 --> 28:39.390]  So that's what we'll push the one down onto, right?
[28:39.550 --> 28:39.710]  Yeah.
[28:42.650 --> 28:43.770]  Please get away from me.
[28:44.610 --> 28:45.470]  Please get away from me.
[28:51.780 --> 28:53.160]  So how did we do this?
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.380]  It just needs to go a little bit further.
[28:54.780 --> 28:55.690]  You guys have to like...
[28:56.620 --> 28:57.300]  Oh, goddammit.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.440]  You shouldn't move.
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.740]  No, no, no, no.
[28:59.740 --> 29:00.200]  I should not.
[29:01.080 --> 29:03.520]  Bottom person there just needs to be against it, I guess.
[29:04.180 --> 29:04.320]  Yeah.
[29:06.520 --> 29:07.020]  Oh, right.
[29:16.500 --> 29:18.000]  I don't know what...
[29:18.000 --> 29:18.540]  This is fine, there's enough room.
[29:18.620 --> 29:22.760]  What the preoccupation is with getting as close as possible like this, right?
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.820]  If that person is risking their life, then give them space. What's the issue?
[29:27.820 --> 29:29.280]  That was like three widths.
[29:30.920 --> 29:32.640]  Andrew, jump up here and push me.
[29:32.760 --> 29:32.980]  There you go.
[29:33.480 --> 29:34.860]  That might be far enough.
[29:38.980 --> 29:39.300]  Cool.
[29:42.300 --> 29:43.800]  Okay, so how do we want to do...
[29:43.800 --> 29:44.980]  We need one person up here.
[29:45.640 --> 29:45.880]  Yep.
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.560]  Yeah, and they're going to push backwards.
[29:48.480 --> 29:49.660]  Do we need to push backwards?
[29:49.860 --> 29:51.180]  I think just going forward is fine.
[29:51.280 --> 29:52.020]  Once it gets past.
[29:52.180 --> 29:53.460]  Once it gets past, I think.
[29:53.660 --> 29:54.260]  Oh, okay.
[29:54.380 --> 29:54.780]  Wait, wait, wait.
[29:54.860 --> 29:56.640]  Get on the right side of that, Andrew.
[29:57.060 --> 29:57.780]  Ah, sorry.
[29:58.000 --> 29:58.820]  I edged it a little too far.
[29:59.500 --> 30:00.580]  You don't have to push it at all.
[30:00.620 --> 30:02.120]  You just have to get on the other side of it.
[30:02.240 --> 30:02.380]  Yeah.
[30:03.280 --> 30:03.640]  Okay.
[30:04.320 --> 30:05.400]  Yeah, no need to push.
[30:05.580 --> 30:05.740]  Yeah.
[30:06.700 --> 30:07.900]  Eric, I'm giving you space.
[30:08.400 --> 30:09.100]  Gavin, why?
[30:09.200 --> 30:09.780]  Why, Gavin?
[30:09.960 --> 30:10.120]  Why?
[30:10.120 --> 30:11.140]  He has plenty of space.
[30:11.600 --> 30:11.760]  Why?
[30:11.980 --> 30:13.500]  I just don't get what the point is.
[30:13.720 --> 30:14.160]  You know what I mean?
[30:15.460 --> 30:16.860]  Orange, purple, red, push.
[30:16.900 --> 30:17.240]  That's it.
[30:18.480 --> 30:18.880]  A little more.
[30:19.380 --> 30:19.760]  A little more.
[30:20.660 --> 30:21.140]  That's it.
[30:21.800 --> 30:22.640]  That's probably fine.
[30:23.140 --> 30:23.620]  Yeah, it's good.
[30:26.920 --> 30:27.500]  Group jump.
[30:29.100 --> 30:29.860]  A little hold.
[30:31.040 --> 30:31.540]  Just wait on blue.
[30:33.940 --> 30:34.820]  Just wait on blue.
[30:36.140 --> 30:37.460]  I guess we don't have to wait about it.
[30:37.500 --> 30:37.820]  This is fine.
[30:37.920 --> 30:38.640]  We've got plenty of time.
[30:38.900 --> 30:39.200]  Shit!
[30:39.540 --> 30:39.940]  Do it again.
[30:40.380 --> 30:41.180]  Let's be respectful.
[30:41.380 --> 30:41.600]  Why don't you go?
[30:41.680 --> 30:42.620]  No, wait on blue.
[30:42.980 --> 30:44.800]  He wants the space to move.
[30:44.920 --> 30:46.200]  He wants the space to operate.
[30:46.400 --> 30:46.640]  That's all.
[30:46.680 --> 30:47.260]  Just wait on blue.
[30:47.320 --> 30:48.160]  How easy is that?
[30:48.320 --> 30:48.900]  Just wait on blue.
[30:48.920 --> 30:49.660]  He just wants to listen.
[30:49.820 --> 30:51.280]  Now I understand what Eric's getting at.
[30:53.320 --> 30:54.220]  Purple, orange, red.
[30:54.240 --> 30:54.860]  The only ones to push.
[30:54.920 --> 30:55.160]  That's it.
[30:57.920 --> 30:59.480]  All right, well, that worked for me.
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.880]  I keep getting body checked on that.
[31:05.140 --> 31:05.420]  All right.
[31:06.260 --> 31:08.640]  I think that orange...
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.320]  Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:10.440 --> 31:13.520]  I think orange jumps on top of purple and goes to the other side of one.
[31:13.540 --> 31:13.840]  Careful.
[31:14.500 --> 31:14.940]  There you go.
[31:15.380 --> 31:17.060]  And then we push...
[31:17.060 --> 31:18.180]  We push this one?
[31:18.800 --> 31:19.620]  But not too far.
[31:20.040 --> 31:20.160]  Yeah.
[31:20.480 --> 31:21.800]  Why is there a stack?
[31:22.060 --> 31:23.680]  I think, Nick, if you come down...
[31:23.680 --> 31:24.620]  Yeah, what the fuck's up with that?
[31:24.620 --> 31:26.820]  We all push except Gavin.
[31:27.200 --> 31:27.700]  Except Gavin.
[31:27.840 --> 31:29.320]  I'll do the tweak and everyone gets some shoving.
[31:30.320 --> 31:31.920]  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[31:32.940 --> 31:33.660]  That's pretty close.
[31:35.480 --> 31:38.360]  Okay, I think we want Geoff to push this thing off now.
[31:38.360 --> 31:41.580]  All right, so you guys move away and I'll push this down.
[31:42.960 --> 31:43.320]  Okay.
[31:43.740 --> 31:44.840]  And now you guys just push.
[31:45.940 --> 31:46.700]  Oh, we need...
[31:46.700 --> 31:47.680]  I'm worried about the jump.
[31:47.680 --> 31:47.800]  No, no, no, no.
[31:47.860 --> 31:48.600]  We can...
[31:48.600 --> 31:49.440]  Look, look.
[31:49.800 --> 31:50.120]  Purple.
[31:50.740 --> 31:51.640]  Purple, red, green.
[31:51.720 --> 31:52.140]  Wait, wait, wait.
[31:52.620 --> 31:54.720]  Purple, purple, purple, red, green push.
[31:55.180 --> 31:56.780]  Blue will edge it just a little bit more.
[31:57.320 --> 31:58.380]  Geoff might be in trouble.
[31:59.020 --> 31:59.860]  Geoff can't get back up.
[32:00.240 --> 32:00.880]  No, no, no.
[32:00.980 --> 32:01.180]  He can.
[32:01.700 --> 32:02.300]  Oh, fuck.
[32:02.320 --> 32:02.820]  He can't.
[32:03.960 --> 32:05.660]  So I think, Geoff, you just have to stay up there.
[32:05.940 --> 32:06.660]  Yeah, stay up there.
[32:06.700 --> 32:06.980]  That's fine.
[32:07.240 --> 32:08.220]  Yeah, Geoff went too far.
[32:09.020 --> 32:09.180]  Yeah.
[32:09.340 --> 32:09.500]  Yeah.
[32:10.560 --> 32:12.140]  Well, maybe we should just see what's next.
[32:12.400 --> 32:12.640]  Oh, yeah.
[32:12.640 --> 32:13.580]  We can push that one down.
[32:14.040 --> 32:14.160]  Yeah.
[32:14.160 --> 32:14.520]  Oh, yeah.
[32:14.600 --> 32:14.760]  That's right.
[32:14.760 --> 32:15.380]  We can go get him.
[32:15.760 --> 32:16.200]  You push it left.
[32:18.220 --> 32:20.340]  I'm not sure.
[32:20.340 --> 32:22.440]  I'm not sure what we don't get.
[32:22.520 --> 32:23.300]  We can go get him.
[32:23.540 --> 32:24.100]  But, boy, we don't get it.
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.060]  We get it and then we get it.
[32:26.060 --> 32:27.200]  Give him space.
[32:27.380 --> 32:27.780]  God.
[32:28.800 --> 32:30.160]  Just get on with it.
[32:30.400 --> 32:31.940]  Yeah, I'm with Gavin on this one.
[32:33.820 --> 32:34.900]  The wrongest guys?
[32:35.040 --> 32:35.380]  Yeah, man.
[32:35.640 --> 32:36.400]  I absolutely agree.
[32:36.400 --> 32:36.780]  You know what?
[32:37.320 --> 32:38.620]  I'm beginning to think Eric's right.
[32:39.980 --> 32:41.520]  That's typically how long I last.
[32:41.680 --> 32:42.320]  What do you think?
[32:42.320 --> 32:43.140]  Are you going to get up here or what?
[32:43.140 --> 32:44.460]  What do you think Andrew's doing?
[32:44.580 --> 32:45.140]  There you go.
[32:46.440 --> 32:47.740]  I'm stretching my legs.
[32:49.760 --> 32:50.980]  Let's get on with it, guys.
[32:51.180 --> 32:51.580]  Purple jump on green.
[32:51.580 --> 32:52.440]  Let's stretch our legs.
[32:52.600 --> 32:53.660]  Purple jump on green.
[32:54.160 --> 32:55.400]  And then someone jump on purple.
[32:55.520 --> 32:56.280]  Get on the other side.
[32:56.380 --> 32:56.700]  That's it.
[32:56.780 --> 32:56.900]  Cool.
[32:57.220 --> 32:58.160]  There we go.
[32:58.760 --> 32:59.900]  You guys all line up.
[33:00.240 --> 33:00.680]  Green up.
[33:00.980 --> 33:01.700]  I'll edge it.
[33:01.700 --> 33:02.640]  You guys just push.
[33:02.800 --> 33:03.120]  There you go.
[33:06.340 --> 33:07.560]  Okay, go ahead and drop that.
[33:07.820 --> 33:08.040]  Go left.
[33:08.200 --> 33:08.500]  Move out.
[33:09.480 --> 33:09.720]  Go ahead.
[33:10.680 --> 33:11.660]  Okay, we're pushing it again.
[33:11.920 --> 33:12.180]  Yep.
[33:12.620 --> 33:13.020]  We're good.
[33:13.280 --> 33:13.580]  Stop.
[33:14.000 --> 33:14.680]  I got it.
[33:14.840 --> 33:15.260]  We're good.
[33:15.860 --> 33:16.560]  He got it.
[33:16.560 --> 33:17.400]  He's got it.
[33:17.440 --> 33:18.560]  No one fall down this hole.
[33:18.920 --> 33:19.420]  Oh, okay.
[33:20.000 --> 33:20.800]  Yeah, that's fine.
[33:20.860 --> 33:21.920]  Go for it.
[33:24.940 --> 33:27.080]  Now, we don't have to fuck with this, I don't think.
[33:27.940 --> 33:28.300]  Right.
[33:28.720 --> 33:29.600]  We probably just drop down.
[33:29.840 --> 33:30.180]  We might.
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.040]  We might.
[33:31.400 --> 33:32.620]  Let's just do the same thing we did at the beginning.
[33:32.620 --> 33:34.140]  One of us drop down and take a look.
[33:36.260 --> 33:36.980]  I think...
[33:36.980 --> 33:38.260]  Can I push it from here?
[33:38.680 --> 33:39.640]  Blue, can you go up against it?
[33:41.000 --> 33:41.880]  I can't push it.
[33:42.020 --> 33:42.620]  Oh, it's short.
[33:42.860 --> 33:43.600]  Yeah, it's short.
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.880]  Do you want me to jump down?
[33:46.260 --> 33:46.980]  Yeah, jump down.
[33:48.740 --> 33:49.760]  Can you jump up there?
[33:49.780 --> 33:51.980]  I need that block.
[33:52.500 --> 33:53.820]  How do we do that?
[33:56.160 --> 33:56.620]  Do we?
[33:56.740 --> 33:57.420]  Is there one over there?
[33:57.820 --> 33:58.900]  Purple, come closer.
[33:59.440 --> 33:59.700]  Sorry.
[34:00.100 --> 34:00.680]  Hold on.
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.080]  Can you move any further?
[34:05.240 --> 34:06.420]  I need you guys to come down.
[34:07.300 --> 34:08.100]  I don't know that we can.
[34:08.100 --> 34:09.200]  If we come down, we might be done.
[34:09.200 --> 34:09.920]  We can without...
[34:09.920 --> 34:11.440]  I don't know that we can without...
[34:11.440 --> 34:12.700]  That's as far as we can go.
[34:13.180 --> 34:14.640]  Well, could you drop down?
[34:14.880 --> 34:14.980]  Let's risk it.
[34:15.020 --> 34:15.540]  Let's just go down.
[34:15.820 --> 34:17.200]  Hey, let's just do it.
[34:17.200 --> 34:19.380]  Everyone go, because we're going to have to redo it anyway, so it's fine.
[34:19.640 --> 34:20.080]  Let's just...
[34:20.080 --> 34:20.660]  Everyone go.
[34:21.040 --> 34:21.800]  Let's just see...
[34:21.800 --> 34:22.260]  What'd that do?
[34:22.620 --> 34:22.960]  Hit that.
[34:24.600 --> 34:24.920]  Oh!
[34:25.340 --> 34:26.400]  Block, block, block!
[34:26.620 --> 34:27.060]  Oh my god!
[34:27.140 --> 34:27.880]  Oh my god!
[34:28.980 --> 34:30.320]  Get the hell out of here!
[34:30.460 --> 34:30.680]  That was so easy.
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.120]  Get the hell out of here!
[34:32.180 --> 34:32.440]  That's crazy.
[34:32.800 --> 34:34.180]  We almost gave up on that.
[34:35.100 --> 34:35.800]  Dark world!
[34:36.820 --> 34:37.260]  Achievement!
[34:37.320 --> 34:38.200]  One section is done!
[34:38.340 --> 34:38.900]  This is so fucking easy.
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.360]  2% achievement.
[34:40.640 --> 34:40.840]  Damn.
[34:40.840 --> 34:41.420]  So simple.
[34:41.660 --> 34:42.520]  So simple.
[34:42.700 --> 34:43.220]  That was nothing.
[34:43.220 --> 34:44.620]  Hey, no one's been in the dark part.
[34:45.760 --> 34:46.840]  Except for us.
[34:46.840 --> 34:48.220]  We're the dark boys.
[34:48.240 --> 34:48.800]  Hey, we're back again.
[34:48.820 --> 34:49.400]  That's right, baby.
[34:50.140 --> 34:50.860]  Is that it?
[34:51.360 --> 34:51.820]  That's it.
[34:51.880 --> 34:52.640]  We beat the whole game.
[34:53.140 --> 34:53.520]  No!
[34:54.040 --> 34:55.080]  Not the hard part!
[34:55.600 --> 34:56.240]  Oh, the hard part.
[34:56.400 --> 34:57.240]  You thought it was the dark part.
[34:57.280 --> 34:57.420]  Oh, that shit.
[34:58.840 --> 34:59.380]  Oh, boy.
[35:00.700 --> 35:01.640]  This doesn't seem bad.
[35:01.680 --> 35:02.240]  Some stairs.
[35:02.620 --> 35:03.680]  Alright, I'm going to do some testing.
[35:04.180 --> 35:04.360]  Okay.
[35:08.400 --> 35:10.100]  I think we should stay left.
[35:10.580 --> 35:10.820]  Oh!
[35:10.940 --> 35:12.360]  Oh, we don't go with it!
[35:12.660 --> 35:13.680]  Oh my god!
[35:13.780 --> 35:14.380]  We gotta run with it.
[35:14.420 --> 35:15.180]  We don't go with it!
[35:16.980 --> 35:17.260]  Should...
[35:17.260 --> 35:18.640]  That goes out from under us.
[35:18.720 --> 35:19.000]  Should we...
[35:19.000 --> 35:19.500]  Oh, we can't.
[35:19.560 --> 35:20.520]  We're not going to be able to stack up.
[35:20.580 --> 35:21.300]  We're going to be too tall.
[35:21.560 --> 35:22.380]  We're going to have to also...
[35:22.380 --> 35:23.300]  We're just going to have to run it.
[35:23.560 --> 35:24.240]  We're just going to have to run it.
[35:24.240 --> 35:24.760]  We're just going to have to run it.
[35:24.860 --> 35:25.040]  Alright.
[35:26.220 --> 35:26.780]  Last person.
[35:27.120 --> 35:27.220]  Yeah.
[35:27.820 --> 35:28.100]  Okay.
[35:28.880 --> 35:29.260]  Alright, ready?
[35:29.420 --> 35:29.740]  Here we go.
[35:32.240 --> 35:33.300]  And then this way.
[35:33.320 --> 35:34.100]  Left, left, left, left, left.
[35:34.360 --> 35:34.380]  Oh!
[35:34.580 --> 35:35.340]  Way to go, Nick!
[35:35.340 --> 35:36.400]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[35:37.760 --> 35:38.540]  He's still on Eric's side.
[35:38.600 --> 35:39.120]  Come on, man.
[35:39.120 --> 35:39.980]  It's the first time.
[35:40.060 --> 35:41.040]  Nick is still on Eric's side.
[35:41.480 --> 35:41.840]  Chill out.
[35:41.840 --> 35:42.740]  No, he's wrong again.
[35:42.760 --> 35:43.840]  I feel like that was...
[35:51.600 --> 35:53.240]  I'm back on Eric's side.
[35:57.820 --> 36:01.500]  I was still laughing at our inability to look forwards like one step.
[36:01.680 --> 36:01.860]  Yeah.
[36:02.700 --> 36:03.660]  Alright, you guys ready?
[36:04.100 --> 36:04.260]  Yeah.
[36:06.620 --> 36:07.520]  Alright, turn around.
[36:09.220 --> 36:09.660]  And again.
[36:11.360 --> 36:11.840]  Jump.
[36:13.420 --> 36:14.380]  Thank you.
[36:14.460 --> 36:16.460]  Why is someone...
[36:18.360 --> 36:20.020]  Did nobody... Did somebody not jump?
[36:20.180 --> 36:22.120]  Someone just wasn't moving good enough.
[36:22.160 --> 36:22.320]  Yep.
[36:22.680 --> 36:23.280]  I jumped.
[36:27.820 --> 36:28.700]  Alright, you guys ready?
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.420]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[36:29.860 --> 36:30.480]  Alright, here we go.
[36:32.300 --> 36:34.820]  So it's actually faster than us, which sucks.
[36:35.120 --> 36:35.280]  Yep.
[36:36.060 --> 36:36.380]  Right.
[36:36.980 --> 36:37.240]  Jump.
[36:39.460 --> 36:40.860]  It is faster than us.
[36:40.960 --> 36:41.800]  It's faster!
[36:41.800 --> 36:43.100]  Move, move!
[36:44.220 --> 36:45.180]  No, Gavin!
[36:47.380 --> 36:48.760]  That was really good.
[36:49.280 --> 36:50.040]  We really had it there.
[36:50.140 --> 36:51.100]  We really had it.
[36:51.100 --> 36:52.240]  Some of us really had it there.
[36:52.520 --> 36:53.960]  Yeah, all together, really.
[36:57.000 --> 36:57.800]  That'll be the last one.
[36:58.580 --> 36:58.800]  Go!
[37:00.600 --> 37:01.400]  Gavin hesitated.
[37:02.060 --> 37:03.200]  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry!
[37:03.300 --> 37:04.840]  I was trying so hard to give space.
[37:06.740 --> 37:09.920]  It's just as easy to run off the front as it is to get pulled off the back.
[37:10.400 --> 37:10.640]  Yep.
[37:10.640 --> 37:11.520]  I wouldn't know.
[37:13.500 --> 37:14.560]  Here we go.
[37:22.720 --> 37:23.280]  Yes!
[37:27.180 --> 37:28.620]  Okay, okay, okay.
[37:29.840 --> 37:30.720]  He wouldn't know.
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.040]  Thoughts?
[37:31.660 --> 37:32.100]  Thoughts?
[37:32.260 --> 37:34.460]  I was running left, everyone else wasn't.
[37:35.160 --> 37:35.720]  So...
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.380]  Wait, who wasn't?
[37:36.900 --> 37:37.480]  You wouldn't know?
[37:38.120 --> 37:38.620]  Blue?
[37:39.040 --> 37:39.360]  Purple?
[37:39.700 --> 37:40.580]  Whoever's in front of me?
[37:41.020 --> 37:41.120]  Nope.
[37:41.320 --> 37:42.320]  We were all moving.
[37:42.600 --> 37:43.900]  Play the blue tape.
[37:44.020 --> 37:44.600]  That was fine.
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.840]  Oh, my God.
[37:45.920 --> 37:46.580]  Oh, my God.
[37:46.700 --> 37:47.020]  Oh, wow.
[37:47.860 --> 37:48.540]  Oh, God.
[37:48.740 --> 37:49.760]  Any thoughts there, guys?
[37:50.680 --> 37:51.400]  That was a different turn.
[37:51.460 --> 37:52.300]  Andrew wasn't moving.
[37:52.320 --> 37:54.240]  Why are you always like, gosh, girl?
[37:54.600 --> 37:55.100]  Goodbye, Eric.
[37:55.720 --> 37:56.680]  It's like Eric died.
[37:57.060 --> 37:57.280]  Interesting.
[37:57.600 --> 37:58.040]  Right again.
[37:58.180 --> 37:58.380]  Yep.
[37:59.100 --> 38:05.280]  So, this thing being faster than us, we have to be...
[38:05.280 --> 38:05.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:05.860 --> 38:06.560]  Yeah, we got it.
[38:06.700 --> 38:07.320]  We have to...
[38:07.320 --> 38:07.640]  Oh, okay.
[38:07.720 --> 38:08.300]  All right, we got it.
[38:08.960 --> 38:11.200]  It's the difference between getting it and executing it.
[38:11.340 --> 38:11.920]  I get it.
[38:11.920 --> 38:15.180]  Doesn't always mean the execution will be there.
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.100]  Okay.
[38:18.260 --> 38:18.460]  It's tight.
[38:19.200 --> 38:19.280]  All right.
[38:21.500 --> 38:22.180]  Wild.
[38:22.520 --> 38:22.780]  Whoa.
[38:24.060 --> 38:25.020]  Go, go.
[38:25.240 --> 38:25.560]  Who did that?
[38:26.420 --> 38:29.020]  Just curious about who stopped walking.
[38:33.240 --> 38:33.920]  Who's...
[38:33.920 --> 38:35.420]  Who just went...
[38:35.420 --> 38:36.200]  Eh, we're close enough.
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.440]  Stop jumping on my fucking head, man.
[38:42.740 --> 38:43.480]  Get it, Andrew.
[38:50.170 --> 38:50.930]  Well...
[38:50.930 --> 38:52.070]  I'm losing it.
[38:52.790 --> 38:54.190]  I'm losing it.
[38:54.250 --> 38:55.150]  This is so brutal.
[38:56.210 --> 38:57.450]  I'm falling apart.
[38:59.330 --> 39:00.770]  Oh, get the hiccups.
[39:04.710 --> 39:05.510]  Oh, God.
[39:08.490 --> 39:09.390]  What's the point of this?
[39:09.390 --> 39:10.990]  Eric, why?
[39:11.290 --> 39:13.030]  Me and Geoff are hugging in the middle.
[39:13.430 --> 39:14.190]  Yeah, but why?
[39:14.450 --> 39:15.690]  I was trying so hard to go left.
[39:17.950 --> 39:19.790]  Geoff is so locked in.
[39:20.330 --> 39:21.310]  Greenwood, let me.
[39:22.830 --> 39:23.110]  Oops.
[39:24.050 --> 39:27.190]  Just feels so doable to me.
[39:27.510 --> 39:30.110]  And I really feel like we should have already done it.
[39:30.870 --> 39:31.390]  I'm off.
[39:31.810 --> 39:31.990]  I'm off.
[39:31.990 --> 39:32.450]  You're dead.
[39:32.670 --> 39:32.770]  Fuck.
[39:33.490 --> 39:34.370]  You should have jumped.
[39:35.550 --> 39:36.650]  Should have jumped.
[39:37.150 --> 39:37.610]  You could have...
[39:37.610 --> 39:37.890]  You hear that, Eric?
[39:37.890 --> 39:38.630]  Jumped.
[39:38.670 --> 39:38.830]  Yeah.
[39:39.210 --> 39:40.750]  I'll keep that in mind.
[39:40.810 --> 39:42.910]  You could have gone on our heads if you wanted to slip off.
[39:43.310 --> 39:44.590]  That sounded like a criticism of you.
[39:44.670 --> 39:45.530]  I was not criticizing you.
[39:45.590 --> 39:46.350]  I was criticizing Gavin.
[39:46.510 --> 39:47.450]  Why would you criticize me?
[39:47.510 --> 39:48.190]  It was a good suggestion.
[39:48.230 --> 39:49.530]  Because you said some stupid shit.
[39:53.170 --> 39:55.940]  Now, that one might be...
[39:56.410 --> 39:56.950]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:56.950 --> 39:58.370]  Guys, guys, guys.
[40:00.850 --> 40:02.190]  Guys, have a look.
[40:02.510 --> 40:03.470]  Guys, it's too fast.
[40:03.530 --> 40:04.590]  You can't jump on me.
[40:10.170 --> 40:10.890]  This is...
[40:10.890 --> 40:12.490]  This is the best game ever made.
[40:13.550 --> 40:14.670]  It's really good.
[40:16.070 --> 40:16.950]  Oh, this is bad.
[40:16.970 --> 40:17.750]  This is so good.
[40:17.870 --> 40:19.310]  That's real bad for you guys.
[40:19.550 --> 40:20.370]  I know, it's bad.
[40:20.630 --> 40:20.790]  It's bad.
[40:21.330 --> 40:21.790]  It's bad.
[40:21.930 --> 40:23.290]  That was bad.
[40:23.450 --> 40:23.890]  That was bad.
[40:23.970 --> 40:24.690]  Killed me, man.
[40:24.810 --> 40:25.490]  That one was rough.
[40:25.810 --> 40:26.350]  That was tough.
[40:27.490 --> 40:28.650]  I'm right there with you, man.
[40:28.690 --> 40:29.390]  That was a rough one.
[40:31.530 --> 40:32.870]  Sometimes they are, you know?
[40:33.210 --> 40:33.510]  Mm-hmm.
[40:34.130 --> 40:35.610]  Hey, Eric, I hear you.
[40:37.690 --> 40:38.370]  What?
[40:39.430 --> 40:39.650]  What?
[40:40.450 --> 40:41.830]  I can't get down.
[40:43.110 --> 40:43.790]  Look.
[40:44.630 --> 40:45.750]  Look what?
[40:48.090 --> 40:48.190]  What?
[40:52.390 --> 40:52.730]  Gavin!
[40:55.690 --> 40:57.030]  And then I killed us.
[40:57.270 --> 40:58.550]  And then I killed us.
[40:58.830 --> 41:00.290]  I was mad and I kept going right.
[41:00.290 --> 41:01.350]  You purple prick.
[41:02.030 --> 41:02.250]  Why?
[41:03.030 --> 41:04.970]  Because Gavin fucked me first.
[41:04.970 --> 41:06.890]  No, but we didn't die and then you went purple prick.
[41:08.970 --> 41:10.670]  Listen, you blue buffoon.
[41:11.290 --> 41:12.510]  Who's got you there, though?
[41:12.910 --> 41:13.890]  Look, with alliteration.
[41:14.210 --> 41:14.230]  Purple!
[41:14.510 --> 41:14.890]  Why?
[41:15.330 --> 41:15.850]  Okay.
[41:16.150 --> 41:17.410]  What are you doing?
[41:17.510 --> 41:19.130]  I'm gonna walk around you, man.
[41:19.990 --> 41:22.770]  I was just laughing that time.
[41:23.530 --> 41:24.330]  Oh, my God.
[41:24.670 --> 41:25.970]  This is really something, guys.
[41:26.610 --> 41:28.370]  This is the best game ever made.
[41:28.710 --> 41:31.310]  Sometimes blame and guilt affects your next attempt.
[41:31.430 --> 41:32.390]  Yeah, your next step.
[41:32.850 --> 41:33.070]  Shit.
[41:33.070 --> 41:34.650]  That was blue.
[41:36.570 --> 41:37.010]  Oh.
[41:37.390 --> 41:38.250]  Good luck, Gavin.
[41:38.650 --> 41:39.290]  We're still alive.
[41:39.530 --> 41:40.290]  Oh, he's alive!
[41:40.490 --> 41:40.850]  He's alive!
[41:41.770 --> 41:42.210]  Nick!
[41:42.450 --> 41:43.970]  Why did you stop?
[41:44.550 --> 41:47.130]  A man red, orange, and blue were locked in there.
[41:47.130 --> 41:50.150]  Red, orange, and blue were locked in!
[41:50.710 --> 41:50.910]  Yeah.
[41:51.170 --> 41:51.610]  Yeah.
[41:51.750 --> 41:52.030]  Yeah.
[41:52.290 --> 41:52.430]  Yeah.
[41:52.630 --> 41:52.850]  Yeah.
[41:54.890 --> 41:56.770]  This motherfucker needs to go water a tree.
[41:56.870 --> 41:57.550]  Oh, shit.
[41:57.610 --> 41:57.890]  Get down!
[42:00.210 --> 42:01.690]  I do need to water a tree.
[42:01.870 --> 42:02.590]  Oh, you're dead.
[42:02.590 --> 42:03.230]  There's no way.
[42:03.350 --> 42:03.710]  Oh, shit.
[42:04.210 --> 42:05.010]  Yeah, he's dead.
[42:08.190 --> 42:12.390]  I wonder if I could just stay on the key platform and then jump back when it comes around.
[42:12.910 --> 42:13.530]  You could try.
[42:13.850 --> 42:14.610]  That'd be a great move.
[42:15.150 --> 42:15.750]  Give it a shot.
[42:16.110 --> 42:16.510]  All right.
[42:17.190 --> 42:18.050]  Be the last one.
[42:18.710 --> 42:19.190]  Be last.
[42:23.070 --> 42:23.550]  All right.
[42:23.570 --> 42:23.710]  That's me.
[42:24.070 --> 42:24.930]  I don't know what I was doing.
[42:24.930 --> 42:25.290]  That was me.
[42:26.530 --> 42:27.490]  I accept responsibility.
[42:27.690 --> 42:27.970]  That was me.
[42:28.210 --> 42:28.810]  This is great.
[42:28.890 --> 42:30.870]  I was definitely a part of the problem there.
[42:30.950 --> 42:32.210]  I can't say this enough.
[42:32.330 --> 42:33.030]  I love this game.
[42:33.030 --> 42:34.590]  I love this game.
[42:34.630 --> 42:35.390]  You guys suck.
[42:35.390 --> 42:35.750]  It gives me heartburn.
[42:35.750 --> 42:36.550]  This game is awesome.
[42:36.730 --> 42:36.890]  Yeah.
[42:37.950 --> 42:39.290]  Oh, damn it.
[42:40.190 --> 42:42.210]  Whoa, he just defied the law.
[42:42.550 --> 42:42.910]  Grabby.
[42:43.170 --> 42:43.950]  The law.
[42:46.790 --> 42:48.950]  I can't say enough how much I love this game.
[42:49.090 --> 42:49.290]  I love it.
[42:49.290 --> 42:51.690]  I was so wrapped up in him saying the law.
[42:53.530 --> 42:54.430]  Grabby, he's a law.
[42:54.450 --> 42:55.730]  It just broke my brain.
[42:57.570 --> 42:59.510]  Oh, I said it on Geier, so...
[43:03.390 --> 43:04.270]  Oh, no.
[43:08.570 --> 43:11.490]  You so just don't want to be the person holding everyone up.
[43:12.230 --> 43:14.850]  Yeah, it's really the worst feeling in the world, isn't it?
[43:14.950 --> 43:16.570]  Definitely going to shit my pants today.
[43:19.030 --> 43:20.270]  Oh, my God.
[43:21.810 --> 43:24.710]  It's funny because you suddenly get used to your order.
[43:27.550 --> 43:28.650]  Hey, good try.
[43:28.730 --> 43:29.950]  There's only so much we can do there, bud.
[43:29.950 --> 43:34.810]  When you're in the back, you're at the mercy of Geoff in the front for some reason.
[43:35.010 --> 43:35.970]  Stay on the keyhole.
[43:37.330 --> 43:38.090]  It's too far.
[43:38.410 --> 43:39.290]  Well, not all of us, surely, right?
[43:39.630 --> 43:40.610]  Even when it comes back, you think?
[43:40.630 --> 43:41.350]  I evaluated.
[43:42.910 --> 43:43.950]  Oh, my God.
[43:46.050 --> 43:47.410]  I was a little messed up.
[43:47.410 --> 43:47.970]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[43:48.230 --> 43:48.830]  I've been there.
[43:51.010 --> 43:53.790]  See, you just get used to your spot in the rotation.
[43:53.990 --> 43:54.730]  Then you can change it.
[43:54.990 --> 43:57.930]  This might just be like my favorite game ever made.
[43:58.230 --> 43:59.370]  You just keep saying that.
[43:59.370 --> 44:00.650]  You like this better than GTA?
[44:01.070 --> 44:01.930]  Yeah, it really might be.
[44:02.390 --> 44:05.210]  Oh, God, Gavin, you almost did it again.
[44:05.610 --> 44:06.130]  What do you mean?
[44:06.730 --> 44:07.770]  What do you mean, what do you mean?
[44:07.810 --> 44:08.530]  You almost walked off.
[44:08.630 --> 44:09.090]  You defied the law.
[44:09.130 --> 44:10.490]  It's not going to work.
[44:12.050 --> 44:12.850]  Okay, it worked.
[44:13.030 --> 44:13.510]  It worked.
[44:13.630 --> 44:14.070]  It worked.
[44:14.950 --> 44:15.950]  That was so rough, Gavin.
[44:16.230 --> 44:16.690]  Run and jump.
[44:16.770 --> 44:17.230]  Run and jump.
[44:17.330 --> 44:17.510]  Yes.
[44:19.230 --> 44:20.250]  Open the door.
[44:22.190 --> 44:22.730]  Use the key.
[44:22.810 --> 44:23.790]  Why aren't you opening the door?
[44:26.010 --> 44:27.610]  I told you it worked, Gavin.
[44:29.130 --> 44:30.990]  I can't believe that worked, dude.
[44:31.010 --> 44:31.810]  That was incredible.
[44:32.050 --> 44:32.610]  Gavin, play the game.
[44:32.630 --> 44:33.190]  Good job, Gavin.
[44:33.270 --> 44:33.750]  Great job.
[44:34.130 --> 44:35.150]  That was the first level.
[44:35.370 --> 44:38.150]  It was his only option, too, because he would have died if he hadn't done it.
[44:38.830 --> 44:39.050]  Whoa.
[44:41.910 --> 44:43.310]  It's the block game.
[44:47.750 --> 44:48.470]  I'm scared.
[44:48.690 --> 44:49.310]  I don't want to move.
[44:54.940 --> 44:56.400]  I got a good thing going here.
[44:56.740 --> 44:58.080]  Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[44:58.080 --> 44:58.580]  I'm nervous.
[44:58.580 --> 44:59.860]  I got a great thing going.
[45:00.220 --> 45:00.620]  Yeah.
[45:01.080 --> 45:02.840]  All right, let's just focus on the right ball.
[45:03.380 --> 45:03.780]  Okay.
[45:03.880 --> 45:05.640]  And Andrew can just do whatever he needs to do.
[45:05.640 --> 45:07.180]  I got a good thing going here.
[45:09.620 --> 45:11.020]  Guys, I'm locked in.
[45:13.940 --> 45:15.040]  Gavin, we need your ball.
[45:15.260 --> 45:16.280]  Andrew, we need your ball.
[45:20.420 --> 45:22.860]  We made it to the blue, bro.
[45:23.440 --> 45:23.840]  Whoops.
[45:26.100 --> 45:28.300]  All right, should we just use one ball at a time?
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.740]  Oh, God!
[45:30.540 --> 45:31.140]  Wait, wait, wait.
[45:31.300 --> 45:32.600]  You trapped me, red.
[45:32.780 --> 45:33.440]  I'm just kidding.
[45:33.540 --> 45:34.740]  Are we shrinking?
[45:35.500 --> 45:35.720]  Yeah.
[45:35.820 --> 45:37.020]  I think so, yeah.
[45:37.240 --> 45:37.460]  Oh, shit.
[45:37.800 --> 45:38.020]  We are?
[45:38.500 --> 45:39.920]  Gavin, are you playing the game?
[45:40.440 --> 45:40.580]  Yeah.
[45:40.820 --> 45:42.440]  Well, I was looking if I was getting small.
[45:42.820 --> 45:43.040]  Okay.
[45:43.260 --> 45:43.680]  All right.
[45:43.680 --> 45:44.720]  So, the answer is no.
[45:46.340 --> 45:47.400]  He's playing in his mind.
[45:50.460 --> 45:51.060]  Ah, fuck.
[45:51.260 --> 45:51.480]  Okay.
[45:52.320 --> 45:53.840]  So, what do we...
[45:53.840 --> 45:54.480]  We're shrinking.
[45:54.700 --> 45:55.240]  What does that mean?
[45:56.020 --> 45:57.520]  I mean, like, what's the...
[45:57.520 --> 46:00.240]  It just makes it harder, I guess.
[46:00.480 --> 46:01.100]  How does it hit the balls?
[46:03.200 --> 46:03.880]  All right, nice.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.740]  Do you want me to hold off on this one for now?
[46:12.440 --> 46:13.140]  I'm just not...
[46:13.140 --> 46:14.760]  I feel like not moving is kind of the move.
[46:15.800 --> 46:16.660]  Well, it wasn't.
[46:19.780 --> 46:20.880]  It's definitely a move.
[46:21.700 --> 46:22.640]  Okay, no, it's not the move.
[46:22.720 --> 46:23.160]  It's not the move.
[46:23.700 --> 46:24.620]  It's definitely not the move.
[46:25.280 --> 46:25.820]  It's never...
[46:25.820 --> 46:26.840]  I mean, it's just never been the move.
[46:26.980 --> 46:27.720]  This one's all we need.
[46:30.420 --> 46:31.220]  I would hit the floor.
[46:33.680 --> 46:34.520]  Guys, I hit the floor.
[46:35.140 --> 46:37.420]  Guys, there are fucking five of us.
[46:37.460 --> 46:39.320]  All we gotta do is hit one ball.
[46:39.600 --> 46:41.040]  Keep one ball off the ground.
[46:41.740 --> 46:43.240]  It seems infinitely doable.
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.140]  Should we claim...
[46:44.140 --> 46:44.840]  Should we claim ball?
[46:44.960 --> 46:45.220]  Oh, cool.
[46:45.360 --> 46:46.360]  My ball just got hit.
[46:46.500 --> 46:46.980]  Yeah, yeah, it's gone.
[46:47.400 --> 46:47.860]  My ball's gone.
[46:47.880 --> 46:48.560]  Which one was your ball?
[46:49.200 --> 46:50.200]  The one that just vanished.
[46:50.320 --> 46:50.700]  Coming back!
[46:53.960 --> 46:54.280]  Fuck.
[46:58.540 --> 46:58.860]  Oh!
[46:59.020 --> 46:59.520]  This is our ball.
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.100]  We gotta get it up.
[47:00.660 --> 47:00.980]  Okay.
[47:00.980 --> 47:03.620]  If we sneak it around the top...
[47:03.620 --> 47:04.920]  Yep, try to hit it left.
[47:05.620 --> 47:05.880]  Gavin?
[47:09.040 --> 47:09.880]  Oh, that was close.
[47:10.060 --> 47:10.300]  That was a good play.
[47:10.520 --> 47:10.900]  That was a real...
[47:10.900 --> 47:12.300]  That was like a pinball-brained move, man.
[47:12.320 --> 47:12.940]  That was pretty impressive.
[47:13.480 --> 47:14.040]  Come on, come on.
[47:14.220 --> 47:15.360]  Oh, me likey.
[47:15.440 --> 47:15.840]  Me likey.
[47:15.860 --> 47:16.040]  Go back.
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.660]  Gavin has a unique set of skills.
[47:18.240 --> 47:18.260]  Yeah.
[47:18.940 --> 47:19.300]  Yes!
[47:19.380 --> 47:19.700]  Oh, no!
[47:22.100 --> 47:22.420]  Oh.
[47:22.500 --> 47:22.740]  Oh!
[47:22.880 --> 47:23.460]  Oh, God.
[47:23.620 --> 47:23.840]  Interesting hit.
[47:23.980 --> 47:24.400]  Oh, God!
[47:24.940 --> 47:25.300]  Nice.
[47:27.220 --> 47:27.520]  Oh!
[47:29.820 --> 47:30.180]  Close.
[47:31.220 --> 47:32.160]  Got to one.
[47:32.420 --> 47:35.110]  Eric doing nothing but pre-selecting the emote.
[47:35.780 --> 47:37.280]  So, are we doing all at once, or...
[47:37.280 --> 47:37.480]  Okay.
[47:37.760 --> 47:38.840]  Okay, well, that answers that.
[47:39.660 --> 47:41.560]  Well, at least three, I guess.
[47:41.700 --> 47:42.300]  Let's save one.
[47:42.680 --> 47:43.440]  And we lost him.
[47:46.640 --> 47:47.420]  Oh, wait.
[47:47.700 --> 47:51.340]  Does the down arrow one, is that what makes us shrink?
[47:52.060 --> 47:52.560]  Oh.
[47:52.560 --> 47:53.100]  I think it might.
[47:53.160 --> 47:54.260]  Oh, that makes sense.
[47:55.980 --> 47:59.400]  I didn't notice there were down arrow ones.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.640]  Are we trying to break it through, or are we trying to get them all eliminated?
[48:04.760 --> 48:06.200]  I think we're trying to get rid of all the blocks.
[48:15.510 --> 48:16.090]  Oh, yes.
[48:16.270 --> 48:16.490]  Uh-oh.
[48:16.690 --> 48:18.130]  Oh, my God.
[48:18.410 --> 48:19.110]  Oh, except for this.
[48:20.010 --> 48:20.490]  All right.
[48:20.690 --> 48:20.850]  Oh.
[48:22.750 --> 48:23.710]  Oh, you took me.
[48:23.850 --> 48:24.010]  Oh.
[48:24.210 --> 48:25.710]  I know, I took you to the right spot.
[48:25.950 --> 48:26.130]  Damn.
[48:26.850 --> 48:31.070]  And then you did nothing after that.
[48:31.090 --> 48:31.590]  You took me.
[48:31.770 --> 48:33.230]  I thought Eric was going to get it.
[48:35.070 --> 48:36.130]  Based on what?
[48:36.130 --> 48:37.590]  You were next to it.
[48:37.650 --> 48:39.270]  You were next to it.
[48:39.510 --> 48:40.470]  What were you doing?
[48:41.250 --> 48:42.730]  Watching you not get it.
[48:43.150 --> 48:44.410]  Damn, he's got you there.
[48:45.130 --> 48:46.970]  I don't know if he's got me.
[48:47.610 --> 48:49.170]  Oh, you definitely got Guy.
[48:50.450 --> 48:51.590]  Oh, that was...
[48:51.590 --> 48:52.630]  How did that happen?
[48:53.650 --> 48:55.090]  Got trapped between...
[48:55.490 --> 48:55.790]  Ah.
[48:56.110 --> 48:56.490]  Thanks, Blue.
[48:57.110 --> 48:57.290]  Oops.
[48:58.950 --> 49:00.630]  Who was next to it that time, Gavin?
[49:01.970 --> 49:02.910]  His imagination.
[49:02.910 --> 49:03.030]  His imagination.
[49:05.730 --> 49:06.150]  Ah.
[49:06.430 --> 49:06.850]  Holy.
[49:07.110 --> 49:07.330]  Ah.
[49:07.450 --> 49:07.810]  Whoa.
[49:08.650 --> 49:09.470]  Oh, Nick.
[49:10.070 --> 49:11.550]  Nick's just going for it.
[49:11.950 --> 49:12.930]  I appreciate it.
[49:13.810 --> 49:14.550]  Look at this.
[49:17.330 --> 49:17.750]  Oof.
[49:18.130 --> 49:18.350]  Uh-oh.
[49:18.390 --> 49:18.870]  We're tiny.
[49:19.170 --> 49:20.150]  Oh, no, we're tiny.
[49:20.510 --> 49:21.030]  Oh, get up there.
[49:21.410 --> 49:21.990]  Oh, we're tiny.
[49:22.210 --> 49:23.190]  Oh, balls.
[49:23.310 --> 49:23.770]  We still got some.
[49:24.250 --> 49:25.770]  Okay, we got to make a tower to reach them.
[49:25.770 --> 49:25.970]  I can't reach it anymore.
[49:27.270 --> 49:28.750]  Good Lord, we're fast, though.
[49:28.950 --> 49:29.750]  Ah, Geoff.
[49:29.750 --> 49:31.710]  All right, well, that could have gone better.
[49:34.670 --> 49:35.290]  All right.
[49:37.510 --> 49:38.250]  It's so...
[49:38.250 --> 49:38.710]  Okay, ready?
[49:38.870 --> 49:39.970]  It's so bouncy.
[49:40.810 --> 49:41.570]  Ah, damn.
[49:43.490 --> 49:44.250]  Wow, Eric.
[49:44.330 --> 49:44.930]  Come on, man.
[49:46.290 --> 49:46.650]  We haven't...
[49:46.650 --> 49:47.510]  Oh, damn it.
[49:48.170 --> 49:49.930]  I spiked it into Eric's face.
[49:50.470 --> 49:50.690]  Oh.
[49:51.130 --> 49:52.050]  That was bullshit.
[49:52.150 --> 49:52.670]  I fucked up.
[49:52.770 --> 49:53.350]  That was bullshit.
[49:53.350 --> 49:54.190]  On my screen, that means that it wasn't your fault.
[49:54.190 --> 49:55.390]  I don't blame this on the ball.
[49:55.790 --> 49:56.550]  Oh, I'm focused.
[49:57.450 --> 49:59.810]  I watched it disappear into Geoff somehow.
[49:59.810 --> 50:02.730]  I don't know how it disappeared into Geoff, but...
[50:03.210 --> 50:04.250]  It did it again.
[50:06.050 --> 50:07.470]  Gavin's saying focus on the ball.
[50:07.690 --> 50:09.690]  The first hit, the ball went away.
[50:10.030 --> 50:10.390]  You're...
[50:10.390 --> 50:10.830]  That's...
[50:10.830 --> 50:12.130]  What are you two facing?
[50:12.150 --> 50:13.290]  What are we doing?
[50:14.190 --> 50:16.090]  Facing the whole wall.
[50:16.730 --> 50:17.370]  Oh, this is bad.
[50:17.370 --> 50:17.890]  How are you going?
[50:17.950 --> 50:18.650]  You're going cooked.
[50:20.030 --> 50:20.670]  Don't worry.
[50:20.690 --> 50:21.490]  So, what are we...
[50:21.490 --> 50:22.810]  Me and Nick got this one.
[50:23.930 --> 50:24.470]  I meant...
[50:24.470 --> 50:27.190]  I meant focus on the ball, not the emote.
[50:29.350 --> 50:29.830]  Okay.
[50:30.730 --> 50:31.210]  No.
[50:31.930 --> 50:32.630]  Hold on.
[50:34.090 --> 50:35.770]  Eric, how should we play this, do you think?
[50:37.070 --> 50:38.490]  Let's jump at the same time.
[50:38.530 --> 50:38.710]  Ready?
[50:39.230 --> 50:39.450]  Yeah.
[50:39.630 --> 50:41.550]  One, two, three.
[50:42.430 --> 50:42.710]  Yeah.
[50:44.890 --> 50:45.670]  Andrew, jump.
[50:46.890 --> 50:48.630]  Oh, nice.
[50:50.710 --> 50:50.970]  No.
[50:52.230 --> 50:52.990]  Oh, yes.
[50:53.510 --> 50:54.410]  Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
[50:54.770 --> 50:55.170]  Great.
[50:58.570 --> 50:59.150]  It's...
[50:59.810 --> 51:03.130]  Alright, everyone ready?
[51:03.490 --> 51:03.610]  Yeah.
[51:04.730 --> 51:06.390]  Oh, no.
[51:06.810 --> 51:07.110]  Oh, shit.
[51:07.670 --> 51:08.450]  Oh, fuck.
[51:09.890 --> 51:10.470]  Well...
[51:10.470 --> 51:11.710]  It's a good dodge there, Purple.
[51:12.410 --> 51:13.490]  It's so sensitive.
[51:13.790 --> 51:14.430]  I know, I know.
[51:16.490 --> 51:17.670]  This is hard.
[51:22.890 --> 51:24.050]  I mean...
[51:24.050 --> 51:25.170]  That was...
[51:25.170 --> 51:25.730]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[51:27.710 --> 51:28.450]  Oh, God.
[51:28.530 --> 51:29.550]  Way to go, guys.
[51:30.190 --> 51:31.970]  I didn't even know there was a second one going.
[51:32.170 --> 51:33.350]  I was looking at the one on top.
[51:33.690 --> 51:34.590]  Look at how slow this one's going.
[51:34.590 --> 51:35.670]  You gotta let us know.
[51:35.790 --> 51:37.410]  Yeah, call it out when you get a start one.
[51:38.670 --> 51:39.070]  Okay.
[51:41.490 --> 51:42.290]  Good save.
[51:43.170 --> 51:43.570]  Thank you.
[51:46.150 --> 51:46.550]  Dodge.
[51:47.870 --> 51:48.670]  There goes another.
[51:52.940 --> 51:55.760]  The sound of someone almost saying something.
[51:56.940 --> 51:58.200]  That's a lot of regulation.
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.780]  This is agonizingly long.
[52:04.250 --> 52:04.850]  Wow.
[52:05.250 --> 52:07.950]  Oh, that...
[52:13.560 --> 52:15.020]  The latest jump.
[52:19.900 --> 52:20.500]  Dammit.
[52:20.940 --> 52:21.140]  Geoff!
[52:25.860 --> 52:26.940]  Oh, my God.
[52:27.000 --> 52:27.820]  I chased it.
[52:27.940 --> 52:30.120]  I chased it to the corner and made it.
[52:35.220 --> 52:35.700]  No!
[52:37.340 --> 52:38.440]  Oh, God.
[52:38.800 --> 52:39.540]  Oh, this actually...
[52:39.540 --> 52:40.140]  Maybe this works better.
[52:40.380 --> 52:41.320]  No, it doesn't.
[52:41.540 --> 52:42.600]  Two down, three down, four down.
[52:44.140 --> 52:44.620]  No!
[52:54.800 --> 52:56.080]  We're getting small.
[52:57.260 --> 52:59.640]  We just need to break that last...
[52:59.640 --> 53:01.280]  We just need to get it behind it.
[53:01.940 --> 53:02.220]  Yeah.
[53:03.680 --> 53:04.160]  Yeah.
[53:05.380 --> 53:08.500]  I feel like Eric's thinking more about emotes than he is about the game.
[53:09.540 --> 53:11.800]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:11.940 --> 53:12.600]  Oh, God.
[53:12.700 --> 53:13.080]  I hate it.
[53:13.180 --> 53:13.460]  I hate it.
[53:13.540 --> 53:13.800]  I hate it.
[53:13.860 --> 53:14.260]  I hate it.
[53:14.640 --> 53:16.940]  Eric has lost his goddamn mind.
[53:17.260 --> 53:17.420]  Eric!
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.460]  It's like 503 in his mind.
[53:23.420 --> 53:23.820]  Jesus.
[53:24.620 --> 53:24.840]  Whoa.
[53:25.000 --> 53:25.760]  This is a bad run.
[53:25.860 --> 53:27.400]  We're all as small as we can be.
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.840]  Eric, are you trying to tank the ball market?
[53:32.780 --> 53:33.340]  Is that the president?
[53:34.540 --> 53:34.860]  Okay.
[53:37.060 --> 53:38.760]  Yeah, Eric, what are your ball intentions?
[53:43.560 --> 53:44.240]  Get up there.
[53:44.400 --> 53:44.920]  Get up there.
[53:45.140 --> 53:46.640]  Get up there, you son of a bitch.
[53:46.860 --> 53:47.180]  Fuck.
[53:48.800 --> 53:49.940]  Eric, goddamn, what was that?
[53:50.020 --> 53:51.960]  He's clicking an emote again.
[53:52.440 --> 53:54.180]  You would have got that if you weren't looking at the list.
[53:56.740 --> 53:57.520]  Yeah, he's doing it.
[53:57.560 --> 53:57.900]  Just do it.
[53:57.980 --> 53:58.280]  Fuck it.
[54:00.680 --> 54:01.520]  Oh, it's coming back!
[54:01.620 --> 54:02.020]  Oh, they're all gone.
[54:02.020 --> 54:03.840]  The only way for us to beat this is accidentally.
[54:04.500 --> 54:06.300]  I think the only way to beat it is to stop Eric.
[54:07.320 --> 54:09.340]  Jump on him before he can jump.
[54:10.340 --> 54:11.800]  Look for Eric, land on his head.
[54:11.880 --> 54:12.020]  Hold him down!
[54:12.500 --> 54:13.160]  Hold him down.
[54:13.220 --> 54:13.700]  Get him!
[54:13.960 --> 54:14.220]  Get him!
[54:14.400 --> 54:15.740]  No, no, no!
[54:16.180 --> 54:18.040]  Why are you guys hitting them all anyway?
[54:18.840 --> 54:21.120]  I was trying to get the... whoever he is.
[54:21.860 --> 54:23.740]  I didn't even have to do anything that time.
[54:25.200 --> 54:25.820]  It's true.
[54:26.080 --> 54:27.440]  You didn't do anything any time.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.120]  Guys, we figured it out.
[54:35.220 --> 54:37.180]  You just jump at the same time when it gets in between.
[54:37.340 --> 54:38.820]  Oh, come on.
[54:39.580 --> 54:41.140]  What did I just say, Andrew?
[54:41.240 --> 54:41.920]  It worked!
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.320]  What are you talking about?
[54:43.820 --> 54:44.300]  It was fine.
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.280]  You took a huge risk.
[54:45.360 --> 54:46.680]  But it worked.
[54:46.820 --> 54:47.440]  Why are you yelling?
[54:50.180 --> 54:50.620]  Stop.
[54:51.680 --> 54:52.580]  Stop being okay.
[54:52.900 --> 54:53.320]  Here we go.
[54:54.780 --> 54:55.460]  Here we go.
[54:56.400 --> 54:57.600]  Hey, good job, Eric.
[54:57.760 --> 54:59.120]  Eric's killing it right now.
[54:59.500 --> 54:59.900]  Oh, no.
[55:00.180 --> 55:00.360]  Okay.
[55:00.360 --> 55:01.880]  Oh, now it's over.
[55:03.160 --> 55:05.340]  That was really bad.
[55:05.440 --> 55:06.060]  That was really bad.
[55:06.540 --> 55:08.120]  And I'm just accounting for that.
[55:08.760 --> 55:09.760]  I'm being honest about it.
[55:09.960 --> 55:10.080]  Okay.
[55:10.440 --> 55:10.880]  Missed.
[55:12.360 --> 55:14.520]  The physics are weird when you're so tiny.
[55:17.140 --> 55:18.180]  Okay, well.
[55:19.540 --> 55:20.300]  We're about halfway.
[55:21.300 --> 55:21.540]  Yeah?
[55:22.000 --> 55:22.440]  Oh, yeah.
[55:22.720 --> 55:23.180]  We're about halfway on that run.
[55:24.280 --> 55:25.020]  We'll get it.
[55:28.890 --> 55:29.850]  We got it.
[55:29.950 --> 55:30.610]  We got it.
[55:30.610 --> 55:31.710]  Got one out of it.
[55:31.710 --> 55:32.610]  We're doing great here.
[55:33.950 --> 55:35.410]  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[55:35.830 --> 55:38.190]  Look at all the work we're getting out of the first.
[55:38.270 --> 55:38.750]  Oh, no.
[55:39.490 --> 55:40.330]  We've activated two.
[55:40.510 --> 55:40.810]  That's fine.
[55:41.030 --> 55:41.490]  That's okay.
[55:41.530 --> 55:42.190]  We're back down to one.
[55:43.310 --> 55:44.030]  That's okay.
[55:44.150 --> 55:46.190]  We're back down to one.
[55:47.790 --> 55:48.510]  Problem solved.
[55:49.250 --> 55:50.530]  It's so funny.
[55:55.110 --> 55:57.130]  Gavin, you want to hit that one?
[55:57.230 --> 55:57.450]  Yeah.
[55:57.530 --> 55:57.970]  There you go.
[55:58.030 --> 55:58.870]  Great job, Gavin.
[56:00.610 --> 56:01.530]  Good, good, good, good.
[56:01.970 --> 56:08.070]  Oh, this is...
[56:08.810 --> 56:09.610]  You're doing very...
[56:09.610 --> 56:10.610]  Oh, nice pin, Andrew.
[56:10.830 --> 56:11.290]  Thank you.
[56:12.190 --> 56:13.190]  Very good work, Gavin.
[56:18.240 --> 56:18.880]  Oh, God.
[56:19.520 --> 56:19.940]  Oh, God.
[56:21.580 --> 56:22.360]  Sorry about that.
[56:22.460 --> 56:23.720]  Oh, you've activated the second one.
[56:23.780 --> 56:24.460]  Didn't mean to do that.
[56:24.600 --> 56:24.800]  This is good.
[56:25.100 --> 56:25.600]  This is fine.
[56:25.860 --> 56:26.480]  Just watch both.
[56:26.600 --> 56:26.940]  Never mind.
[56:27.380 --> 56:27.660]  Okay.
[56:28.760 --> 56:29.520]  Problem solved.
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.060]  We're at maximum small.
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.460]  We got balls in the bank.
[56:38.400 --> 56:39.660]  Go into the bank.
[56:40.220 --> 56:40.900]  All right.
[56:40.960 --> 56:41.980]  Let's make a deposit.
[56:42.600 --> 56:42.960]  But withdrawal.
[56:43.380 --> 56:43.700]  Ah!
[56:43.920 --> 56:44.380]  Whatever.
[56:46.000 --> 56:46.800]  Nice, Eric.
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.560]  I meant to say withdrawal.
[56:49.680 --> 56:49.960]  You're right.
[56:50.180 --> 56:50.520]  You're right.
[56:51.400 --> 56:52.400]  We all know that.
[56:52.660 --> 56:53.500]  That was right.
[56:54.820 --> 56:55.400]  We knew what you meant.
[56:57.060 --> 56:57.520]  Yeah.
[56:57.740 --> 56:58.780]  That was great.
[56:58.780 --> 56:59.320]  Oh.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.880]  Oh, it's so annoying that the whole final wall is still up.
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.840]  This is bad bounce luck.
[57:06.920 --> 57:07.200]  Okay.
[57:09.380 --> 57:09.860]  Well...
[57:09.860 --> 57:11.240]  It looked like Purple dunked it.
[57:11.660 --> 57:12.420]  It sure did.
[57:12.980 --> 57:13.740]  Why don't we...
[57:13.740 --> 57:17.720]  Why don't we go one at a time and just focus every start ball in the same place?
[57:18.360 --> 57:18.600]  Okay.
[57:19.920 --> 57:20.680]  Like this.
[57:21.000 --> 57:21.440]  There we go.
[57:22.040 --> 57:22.680]  Good shot.
[57:22.860 --> 57:24.120]  That's where you want us to focus it?
[57:25.700 --> 57:26.300]  Oh, no.
[57:26.760 --> 57:27.400]  Already on two.
[57:27.400 --> 57:28.140]  Oh, but it's...
[57:28.140 --> 57:29.340]  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[57:29.380 --> 57:29.760]  That was great.
[57:29.860 --> 57:31.000]  So, we'll start the future balls.
[57:31.440 --> 57:32.000]  Oh, oh, God.
[57:32.140 --> 57:32.320]  Okay.
[57:32.560 --> 57:33.100]  You stay there.
[57:33.280 --> 57:33.620]  Just pin it.
[57:33.740 --> 57:34.820]  Yeah, I'm just gonna hold this one.
[57:35.520 --> 57:35.820]  Okay.
[57:35.960 --> 57:36.660]  Oh, what about that one?
[57:36.860 --> 57:37.120]  Gavin!
[57:37.680 --> 57:38.660]  Why did you jump?
[57:38.920 --> 57:40.060]  Don't you have to jump to get rid of it?
[57:40.360 --> 57:41.700]  Yes, but we have to time it.
[57:41.820 --> 57:42.220]  Oh, yeah.
[57:44.480 --> 57:45.680]  Oh, that was...
[57:45.680 --> 57:46.260]  It worked?
[57:46.340 --> 57:46.820]  This isn't bad.
[57:47.480 --> 57:48.280]  No, it worked out well.
[57:50.060 --> 57:50.360]  Please.
[57:52.160 --> 57:52.460]  Fuck.
[58:04.510 --> 58:04.810]  Okay.
[58:06.190 --> 58:07.150]  Oh, oh, come on.
[58:07.150 --> 58:08.290]  Come on, come on, come on.
[58:08.790 --> 58:09.470]  Yes, yes.
[58:09.470 --> 58:10.050]  Get up, get up.
[58:10.110 --> 58:10.970]  You're jumping.
[58:11.190 --> 58:11.450]  Oh, no.
[58:12.030 --> 58:12.330]  Get up.
[58:12.630 --> 58:12.970]  It's okay.
[58:14.210 --> 58:15.070]  Oh, oops.
[58:15.090 --> 58:15.250]  Okay.
[58:15.870 --> 58:16.730]  It worked out.
[58:16.810 --> 58:17.170]  It worked out.
[58:17.270 --> 58:18.710]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[58:18.750 --> 58:19.810]  Oh, yes.
[58:20.510 --> 58:21.190]  Good damage.
[58:21.450 --> 58:21.750]  Yes.
[58:22.350 --> 58:23.130]  Keep going, keep going.
[58:23.130 --> 58:23.910]  Get back up there.
[58:24.130 --> 58:24.530]  Yes.
[58:24.870 --> 58:25.170]  Yes.
[58:25.170 --> 58:25.450]  Yes.
[58:26.190 --> 58:26.550]  Yes.
[58:28.050 --> 58:28.530]  Yes.
[58:29.190 --> 58:30.910]  It's all over now, baby.
[58:31.890 --> 58:32.370]  Yes.
[58:32.370 --> 58:33.790]  Oh, my God.
[58:35.810 --> 58:37.550]  I've never seen something so beautiful.
[58:37.730 --> 58:38.670]  All right, don't piss it away.
[58:39.090 --> 58:39.970]  It's still very hard.
[58:40.970 --> 58:41.170]  Yeah.
[58:42.070 --> 58:42.590]  Okay.
[58:44.050 --> 58:44.630]  Uh-oh.
[58:45.050 --> 58:45.270]  Yes.
[58:45.430 --> 58:47.170]  Keep hitting that row.
[58:47.550 --> 58:47.850]  Yes.
[58:47.970 --> 58:48.230]  Yes.
[58:48.310 --> 58:48.590]  Yes.
[58:48.670 --> 58:48.910]  Yes.
[58:49.890 --> 58:50.330]  Yes.
[58:52.390 --> 58:53.430]  Come on.
[58:53.690 --> 58:56.130]  Four, three, two.
[58:59.810 --> 59:00.850]  Oh, no.
[59:01.070 --> 59:01.290]  Okay.
[59:01.450 --> 59:01.610]  Okay.
[59:03.790 --> 59:03.990]  Yes.
[59:04.690 --> 59:05.090]  Okay.
[59:05.290 --> 59:05.510]  All right.
[59:05.630 --> 59:07.290]  We have significantly more balls than blocks.
[59:07.710 --> 59:08.950]  Let the magic happen.
[59:09.150 --> 59:09.990]  I'm liking this.
[59:10.390 --> 59:11.350]  Oh, I like this.
[59:11.450 --> 59:11.650]  Come on.
[59:11.990 --> 59:12.110]  Yes.
[59:12.970 --> 59:13.510]  Just over.
[59:13.830 --> 59:13.930]  Okay.
[59:13.950 --> 59:14.610]  Oh, it's coming back.
[59:15.350 --> 59:15.750]  One.
[59:16.150 --> 59:16.330]  Come on.
[59:16.370 --> 59:16.570]  Come on.
[59:16.570 --> 59:18.090]  Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.
[59:18.250 --> 59:18.650]  Yes.
[59:18.790 --> 59:19.250]  Go, go, go.
[59:19.270 --> 59:19.950]  Get it, get it, get it.
[59:21.690 --> 59:22.090]  Yes.
[59:23.690 --> 59:23.990]  Yes.
[59:24.270 --> 59:26.290]  4.59 p.m.
[59:27.890 --> 59:28.290]  Incredible.
[59:28.330 --> 59:30.050]  We did that for Rebecca.
[59:30.330 --> 59:31.210]  That was for her birthday.
[59:31.370 --> 59:31.770]  Oh.
[59:32.130 --> 59:32.450]  Woo.
[59:34.730 --> 59:35.370]  Holy hell.
[59:36.070 --> 59:36.710]  What the...
[59:36.710 --> 59:37.450]  Oh, what's...
[59:37.450 --> 59:37.970]  Wait, wait, wait.
[59:37.990 --> 59:38.590]  Break the key.
[59:39.530 --> 59:39.850]  Open.
[59:40.970 --> 59:41.990]  Do we have to avoid it?
[59:42.490 --> 59:43.990]  Do we have to dodge it?
[59:44.090 --> 59:44.210]  Yeah.
[59:44.310 --> 59:45.170]  It does not kill us.
[59:46.830 --> 59:47.950]  Yeah, let's just get out of the way of it.
[59:48.530 --> 59:49.410]  You can jump it, I think.
[59:49.710 --> 59:50.390]  Let me try it one more time.
[59:50.390 --> 59:50.930]  I don't know.
[59:51.050 --> 59:51.850]  You haven't done it yet.
[59:51.870 --> 59:52.250]  Oh, there we go.
[59:53.930 --> 59:54.730]  Ah, I missed.
[59:54.810 --> 59:56.110]  Oh, this is the net code, isn't it?
[59:59.050 --> 01:00:01.030]  Why are you so close to me?
[01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.150]  Right on top of you?
[01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:03.050]  So bad.
[01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.450]  I didn't do anything, though.
[01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:05.150]  Oops.
[01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:06.570]  But you need to...
[01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.390]  You have to have run.
[01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.290]  I'm standing against it.
[01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:10.210]  You have to have lead up.
[01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:13.370]  P-speed.
[01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.930]  Okay, there we go.
[01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.790]  Why?
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.150]  Oh, no.
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:18.810]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.450]  Oh, no.
[01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:20.430]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.010]  It's a knuckleball?
[01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:23.310]  Oh, you start over.
[01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:23.730]  Oh, and it heals.
[01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:24.510]  It resets.
[01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:27.270]  We have to get so much right in a row.
[01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.030]  This is unbelievable.
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.390]  This game sucks.
[01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:32.050]  I love this game.
[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.070]  I feel like we're getting that smaller, right?
[01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.650]  I think go under it, right?
[01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:36.810]  Yeah.
[01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.490]  I don't know.
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.250]  You don't have the time.
[01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.330]  Shit.
[01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:41.190]  Shitbags.
[01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.610]  You're gonna have to jump it.
[01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:42.890]  Yeah.
[01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.330]  It's gonna be a timeout.
[01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:44.670]  That was...
[01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:45.410]  I knew it was bad.
[01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.550]  You can just feel sometimes.
[01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:47.370]  Yeah.
[01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:48.870]  Nice jump, Geoff.
[01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.510]  Oops.
[01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:51.310]  That was dead in the middle.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.730]  That was maybe my worst jump.
[01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.850]  Oof.
[01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.150]  A little early on that one.
[01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.990]  5-on-1!
[01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:59.330]  5-on-1!
[01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:03.010]  5-on-1, baby!
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.670]  Real soon.
[01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:04.430]  Best time of the week.
[01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.110]  Thanks so much for being here.
[01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:07.350]  Appreciate you guys watching.
[01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:08.930]  You can watch this VOD on Tuesday.
[01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.290]  Nope.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.990]  That's a motherfucker.
[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.270]  And if you're watching the VOD, welcome to Halfway Through the VOD.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.000]  God.
[01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:02.270]  Alright.
[01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:04.430]  Yeah, take that, you bitch!
[01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:07.650]  God!
[01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:08.730]  Take that!
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.390]  Damn it!
[01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:18.290]  Damn it!
[01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:21.530]  Is it gonna be better if we do stacks on the second one?
[01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:25.090]  What's the other person gonna do?
[01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.710]  They have to reset real quick.
[01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:28.670]  Well, one person will have to do it normal, but everyone else can just jump over the head.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.700]  Like, whoever's the best at jumping the whirly one with a knuckleball.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.300]  Fuck!
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.640]  We can stand on their head.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.040]  I'm losing it! I'm losing it! I'm snapping!
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.020]  Alright.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.900]  It's a small window.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:59.560]  Alright, here we go.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.900]  It gives us a lot of time to stack up.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.520]  Fuck!
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:03.700]  Fucking fuck!
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.020]  Bollocks and shit!
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.080]  Alright, here we go.
[01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.360]  Great job.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.100]  I'm scared.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:16.700]  Fuck!
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.120]  I jumped!
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.780]  I knew as soon as I jumped!
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.000]  I was wrong, I'm wrong again.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.940]  I'm scared.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.140]  Alright, stack up on Nick.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.180]  What?
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.420]  Damn it.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.200]  Not...
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:35.700]  Not yet.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:36.760]  Not yet.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.800]  After you've jumped over it.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:40.400]  Alright, go.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.220]  Wait!
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:42.780]  Wait!
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.280]  Get on!
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.200]  Get on!
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.040]  Get on!
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:46.860]  Jump, jump over!
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.600]  I'm still the first one!
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:50.960]  Why are we stacking?
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.100]  Oh, you didn't do the first one?
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.160]  No, I...
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.800]  I can't breathe.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.120]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:07.240]  This is the funniest game ever made.
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:19.220]  Alright, stack up!
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:19.920]  Stack up!
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.120]  Why?
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.080]  So everyone can get it over easily, only one person has to do it proper.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:25.700]  Okay.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.480]  Get on!
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:26.900]  Jump!
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.560]  Why did you move on the bottom?
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.360]  This stack's a great idea.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.220]  I can't even play the game right now, this is so fucking... Gavin is so into this stacking thing, it's great.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.580]  Alright, get on me.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.240]  Isn't it better if only one person has to do the true job?
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.800]  Yes, we get it, we get it, I get it, I get it, get on, get on, get on!
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:52.980]  It threw me!
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.780]  What the hell is that?
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.800]  It's gonna give us a hint, I think.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.040]  It's telling us what to do.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.200]  It is.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.420]  I can't, I can't, I can't.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.500]  This is so funny.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.840]  We got a hint in Dark Park.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:09.620]  Fuck!
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.360]  A little bit of light in the dark.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.460]  Alright, stack up!
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.080]  Get on!
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:21.460]  Alright, purple.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.100]  Alright, red, go!
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.320]  Oh my god!
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.340]  Why did the middle go?
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.440]  Great question.
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.500]  Ow, I'm getting shot!
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.380]  Fuck!
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.340]  We don't even know what the ball after this is gonna do.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.000]  Maybe there isn't one.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:40.300]  Okay.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.460]  Stack, stack!
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.400]  Come on, come on, come on!
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.680]  Jump on, red, jump on!
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.600]  Fucking, the towers were equal, okay?
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:47.720]  Okay.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.280]  Alright.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.880]  Everyone follow it.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.520]  It's hard, it's really hard.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:02.900]  Alright, stack on me.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.600]  Everyone.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.020]  Get on me.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.180]  Get on me.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.320]  We're mighty close.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.260]  Yeah, I know.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.440]  Alright, Nick first.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.220]  Yep!
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.960]  Then Eric, then Geoff, then me!
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.920]  Andrew, and the netcode.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.640]  Oh, good try, Andrew.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:24.760]  It's close!
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:25.620]  Great try.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.240]  I wanna do it again.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.120]  Welp.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.100]  Correct, correct!
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.060]  That's it!
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:41.960]  Geoff!
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.220]  Oh, I thought you had it, Eric!
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.000]  I thought you had it!
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:47.520]  That was so close.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.760]  It was so close!
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.060]  Stack on me!
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.860]  Oh, we missed it.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.140]  Nevermind.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.720]  Oh, I missed it.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:54.100]  Nevermind.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.040]  Oh, he missed it.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.360]  Nevermind.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.900]  Who wants to do the wiffly jump?
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.100]  I don't mind doing the wiffly.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.360]  Okay, Nick wants it.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.120]  No, you already started stacking on you.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:09.680]  Nick!
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.540]  I got pushed off!
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.960]  You ran four feet into it!
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.180]  Yeah, well...
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:16.420]  Yeah.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.280]  Okay.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.020]  Go, get up, get up, get up.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.880]  Now, Gavin, just...
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.280]  Okay.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.320]  You adjust, you adjust.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.100]  I just...
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:27.280]  Jump!
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.040]  Nick, Nick!
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.200]  Why didn't you move, Nick?
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.120]  Just move left.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:31.740]  Okay, well...
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.160]  Should we just stack for all of it?
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.000]  Just stay stacked?
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.400]  No.
[01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:03.030]  Okay, great.
[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.650]  It's looking good.
[01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:04.030]  Got it.
[01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.270]  Alright, here goes Andrew.
[01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:08.650]  Let's move, let's move up.
[01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:09.890]  Let's move up, away from the...
[01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:11.350]  There we go.
[01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.690]  Yes!
[01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:13.190]  Don't tackle him, you...
[01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:14.370]  What the hell was that?
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:15.830]  Oh, no.
[01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.610]  We should probably stack again.
[01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:17.090]  Okay.
[01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:17.410]  Ooh.
[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:22.810]  That's a real slow one.
[01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:25.830]  Go.
[01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:31.410]  Alright, move up, move up, move up.
[01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:33.870]  Fuuuuuuuck!
[01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:34.710]  That was a good try.
[01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:35.910]  That was a great try.
[01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:38.190]  That was a real good try.
[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:38.710]  Real solid...
[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:40.090]  It was solid shit, man.
[01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:41.410]  Some solid...
[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:42.350]  Fuck.
[01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:56.950]  Oh my god.
[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.750]  Come on, come on.
[01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:05.610]  Do it right.
[01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:06.330]  Oh Christ.
[01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:07.270]  Oh Christ!
[01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:09.830]  It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
[01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.070]  Just go!
[01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.670]  Just go!
[01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:14.870]  Get over it!
[01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.970]  We really backed you into a corner with that one.
[01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.010]  Yeah, we really did.
[01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:22.710]  You got so screwed.
[01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:27.730]  Yes, we know!
[01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:29.650]  We're doing it!
[01:09:34.290 --> 01:09:35.230]  Good stack.
[01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:36.790]  Great stack!
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.100]  Got it?
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.180]  That was so good!
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:50.580]  Oh wait, hold on.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:50.960]  Okay.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.480]  Hold what?
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:53.380]  Nothing.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.680]  Hold the line!
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.000]  Okay, it's close.
[01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:09.330]  Yes!
[01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.450]  Stack, stack!
[01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.550]  It might come out really fast.
[01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:16.650]  Yeah, I... yeah.
[01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.190]  Let's start here and we'll go from there, yeah?
[01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.090]  Oh no!
[01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:22.610]  Oh no!
[01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:23.770]  We have to get past this thing!
[01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.950]  Stack.
[01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:25.770]  Stack!
[01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.490]  Stack.
[01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.730]  We destacked.
[01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.350]  Stack.
[01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:29.610]  There you go.
[01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:30.190]  Up for the door!
[01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:31.690]  Up for the door!
[01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.450]  I mean, we're not gonna die.
[01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:34.910]  Just go!
[01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.470]  Just go!
[01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:36.310]  Oh wait, oh!

[01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.910]  Just get in!
[01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:40.030]  Unbelievable.
[01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:44.030]  Guys, thank you so much for watching Pico Park Hard Park Hard Park.
[01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.910]  We have another level in Hard Park Dark Park.
[01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:48.910]  You'll see that next time we play this.
[01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.950]  What?
[01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:55.050]  Pretty impressive what we saw here today.
[01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.970]  I don't know how that happened, but it happened.
[01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:00.070]  Was that a world first?
[01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.670]  Yeah.
[01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:01.030]  That might be.
[01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.590]  That might be the first time in the world anyone's done that.
[01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.050]  Have to look into that.
[01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.630]  Yep.
[01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:07.430]  I wish I hadn't showered earlier today.
[01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:10.450]  Somebody get in touch with Games Done Quick, let them know about our time there.
[01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:14.830]  I can't believe I didn't throw a phospho-ass right at the end.
[01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:15.750]  Yeah, really.
[01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:16.490]  Bye.
[01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:20.910]  I feel insane.
[01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:21.490]  Yep.
[01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:23.490]  Thank you so much for watching.
