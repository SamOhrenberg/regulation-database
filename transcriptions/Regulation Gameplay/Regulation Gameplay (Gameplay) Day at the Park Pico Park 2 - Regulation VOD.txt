[00:00.000 --> 00:00.680]  Andrew, thoughts?
[00:01.980 --> 00:04.100]  Uh, my thoughts are, let's play Pika Part 2.
[00:04.340 --> 00:05.680]  I don't, I don't care about this counting.
[00:05.680 --> 00:08.660]  I'm just waiting for an amount of piss rats that means we're li-
[00:08.660 --> 00:09.780]  Ah, let's piss rats!
[00:10.100 --> 00:10.540]  Go!
[00:12.440 --> 00:12.880]  Yeah!
[00:13.800 --> 00:15.040]  Alright, let's keep it going.
[00:15.620 --> 00:18.660]  Let's do some courses, what are we doing, dude?
[00:18.900 --> 00:20.500]  Let's go next, mini-games!
[00:21.080 --> 00:21.260]  Oh!
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.180]  This is how you know it's good. Welcome to the stream, guys.
[00:24.280 --> 00:26.260]  We're playing to 5.01pm.
[00:26.800 --> 00:29.020]  The best time of the week.
[00:29.020 --> 00:30.220]  Let's take it- what?
[00:31.080 --> 00:31.900]  Oh, we're shooting apples?
[00:32.480 --> 00:34.420]  Yeah, you gotta shoot them down and then we have to catch them.
[00:34.740 --> 00:35.640]  Am I asleep?
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.120]  What am I doing?
[00:37.940 --> 00:40.280]  Am I like, avatar-ed into this reticle?
[00:42.820 --> 00:43.960]  It's like a light gun game.
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.180]  Yeah, and then we have to catch them.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.200]  Alright, catch all this shit.
[00:48.320 --> 00:49.320]  I'm knocking shit down now.
[00:50.100 --> 00:52.700]  Yeah, there you go. So it's gotta be a left and a right situation.
[00:53.260 --> 00:53.880]  Alright, I got the left.
[00:53.880 --> 00:55.700]  Yeah, well, it doesn't really help either.
[00:55.700 --> 00:57.040]  God, we're so slow.
[00:58.380 --> 01:00.280]  Oh, God, it's so slow at the bottom.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.100]  Yeah, it feels so slow.
[01:02.320 --> 01:02.720]  What the fuck?
[01:03.740 --> 01:05.620]  I feel like it's so slow at the bottom.
[01:09.520 --> 01:09.920]  Nice.
[01:13.620 --> 01:15.080]  I can't go that fast.
[01:15.480 --> 01:16.820]  How do we win? How does it end?
[01:17.280 --> 01:17.540]  We just need two more.
[01:18.340 --> 01:21.300]  Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[01:21.360 --> 01:22.820]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[01:22.820 --> 01:23.860]  Go, go, go, go!
[01:24.900 --> 01:25.160]  No!
[01:26.620 --> 01:27.840]  You guys suck.
[01:28.380 --> 01:29.200]  I made it in!
[01:29.700 --> 01:32.400]  Alright, I'm on the left, I'm on the left.
[01:32.700 --> 01:33.320]  I'm on the right.
[01:33.720 --> 01:36.060]  To be honest, the first half of that was pressing A to shoot.
[01:37.240 --> 01:37.760]  Yeah, same.
[01:38.360 --> 01:38.960]  Got it.
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.720]  Till Andrew said X.
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.020]  Fuck that particular apple.
[01:45.740 --> 01:46.340]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:46.560 --> 01:47.120]  Oh, God.
[01:48.440 --> 01:48.680]  Nice.
[01:48.680 --> 01:49.660]  Oh, shit.
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.020]  Catch that one.
[01:51.280 --> 01:55.080]  I don't think I've missed one yet.
[01:55.100 --> 01:55.400]  Catch that, buddy.
[01:55.880 --> 01:56.880]  We're locked in.
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.040]  Left side's locked, baby.
[02:00.480 --> 02:01.100]  Got it.
[02:01.820 --> 02:03.740]  Okay, that was someone else shot that down.
[02:03.940 --> 02:04.540]  Yeah, that was not you.
[02:05.040 --> 02:07.260]  This is Team Tape.
[02:08.980 --> 02:09.280]  Missed.
[02:10.080 --> 02:10.940]  Don't worry about it.
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.680]  Get the fuck out of the way.
[02:14.800 --> 02:15.960]  Way to go, Andrew!
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.720]  Oh, I was looking at the wrong guy!
[02:18.860 --> 02:20.040]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[02:20.420 --> 02:21.760]  Oh, my Lord.
[02:22.480 --> 02:22.820]  It's fine.
[02:23.060 --> 02:25.740]  Tyler Oak, SDP with 5k subs.
[02:25.860 --> 02:27.300]  Oh, thank you, Tyler Oak.
[02:28.160 --> 02:29.480]  I can't read.
[02:29.680 --> 02:30.440]  Are you alright?
[02:30.720 --> 02:31.720]  Are you okay?
[02:33.920 --> 02:36.340]  Does it smell like pennies right now to you?
[02:39.440 --> 02:41.660]  If I flubbed your name, I deeply apologize.
[02:42.040 --> 02:42.280]  What?
[02:42.280 --> 02:45.720]  We have to catch them and then shoot them into...
[02:45.720 --> 02:46.020]  Okay.
[02:46.440 --> 02:47.480]  Oh, fuck me.
[02:48.200 --> 02:49.320]  What a clunk.
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.640]  And how do you shoot?
[02:51.060 --> 02:51.380]  X.
[02:53.340 --> 02:54.680]  Our bull's hit.
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.020]  I was trying to get some...
[02:57.020 --> 02:57.920]  Oh, my God!
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.800]  Okay, I got one in.
[03:03.720 --> 03:04.900]  Hard to get it in.
[03:05.660 --> 03:05.900]  Yeah.
[03:06.300 --> 03:07.900]  Ah, shit.
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.760]  Dude, this is tough.
[03:09.760 --> 03:12.020]  Dude, I can't get a dick in this.
[03:12.040 --> 03:12.540]  Shit.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.380]  Oh, my God.
[03:15.340 --> 03:16.660]  Oh, my God!
[03:16.680 --> 03:18.680]  I'm learning, I'm learning here.
[03:19.260 --> 03:19.500]  Too much.
[03:19.880 --> 03:22.700]  God damn it.
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.200]  I'm teasing the rim here.
[03:27.660 --> 03:29.900]  Dude, this is...
[03:31.300 --> 03:31.920]  Okay, got one.
[03:32.620 --> 03:33.180]  Yeah!
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.760]  Got two.
[03:35.620 --> 03:36.320]  Oh, my God.
[03:36.320 --> 03:37.620]  God damn it.
[03:38.220 --> 03:38.900]  Damn it.
[03:40.860 --> 03:41.320]  Three.
[03:41.800 --> 03:42.500]  Dude, damn it.
[03:43.560 --> 03:45.820]  This one is rough, boys.
[03:46.080 --> 03:47.000]  Oh, my God.
[03:47.700 --> 03:49.900]  All right, go all the way over to the left there.
[03:50.160 --> 03:51.680]  Thanks, Andrew. Way to go, dude.
[03:52.260 --> 03:53.020]  I'm just holding right.
[03:53.480 --> 03:55.820]  Is that max to how many we can hold?
[03:56.820 --> 03:57.200]  No.
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.700]  Not that I know of. I haven't reached it.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.380]  God damn you, me.
[04:02.400 --> 04:03.300]  Oh, straight up. Brilliant.
[04:03.300 --> 04:04.780]  Nice one, Jesus.
[04:06.300 --> 04:07.460]  Get on the shelf, man.
[04:07.560 --> 04:08.640]  Too much!
[04:11.140 --> 04:12.380]  God damn it.
[04:13.380 --> 04:14.200]  There's one.
[04:14.840 --> 04:15.800]  Oh, come on.
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.800]  Oh, I scored in the one I wasn't aiming for.
[04:19.280 --> 04:19.440]  Cool.
[04:20.420 --> 04:21.720]  Yeah, I did it.
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.260]  Damn, I suck.
[04:23.600 --> 04:24.800]  No, you bitch!
[04:26.260 --> 04:26.720]  Got it.
[04:26.880 --> 04:28.240]  Come on, Andrew, get one.
[04:28.240 --> 04:28.600]  Fuck.
[04:29.520 --> 04:30.920]  Come on, Andrew.
[04:31.260 --> 04:32.040]  There we go.
[04:32.600 --> 04:34.340]  I fucking hate myself.
[04:35.280 --> 04:36.500]  I teased both Rimmel.
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.440]  Damn, I suck.
[04:39.960 --> 04:42.420]  It's so hard to do this.
[04:42.800 --> 04:43.060]  Got one.
[04:43.360 --> 04:44.880]  Get two more before we all die.
[04:45.100 --> 04:45.840]  This is pretty tough.
[04:49.480 --> 04:51.320]  This is a tough one.
[04:52.160 --> 04:53.640]  No, this is really hard.
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.100]  I'm good at getting snow.
[04:55.100 --> 04:56.080]  That's it.
[04:57.720 --> 04:59.660]  You think it's snow?
[05:00.680 --> 05:01.200]  No, it's asbestos.
[05:02.300 --> 05:02.700]  Oh.
[05:03.080 --> 05:04.200]  Look at my little snowballs.
[05:05.780 --> 05:07.100]  How do I...?
[05:07.700 --> 05:08.040]  Oof.
[05:09.120 --> 05:09.880]  Oh, bullshit.
[05:12.460 --> 05:12.900]  Bullshit!
[05:12.940 --> 05:13.580]  Get in there, you!
[05:15.500 --> 05:16.520]  Get in there!
[05:16.620 --> 05:17.300]  Get in there, you!
[05:18.920 --> 05:20.700]  Get in there, you!
[05:21.120 --> 05:22.040]  Fucking three in a row.
[05:22.040 --> 05:22.180]  No!
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.120]  Fucking hubris.
[05:25.560 --> 05:28.080]  You son of a bitch!
[05:28.720 --> 05:29.680]  Going over to this side.
[05:30.800 --> 05:31.660]  That was nuts.
[05:31.840 --> 05:32.920]  There it is! Get in!
[05:33.220 --> 05:34.920]  Go, go, go!
[05:35.740 --> 05:36.640]  Get out of the way!
[05:37.700 --> 05:38.800]  Get out of the...
[05:39.680 --> 05:42.280]  Oh my god, dude. That's the game of my life right there.
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.440]  I didn't hit a single one.
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.080]  Good job, Geoff.
[05:45.480 --> 05:47.700]  I got one. I think it bounced off Eric's forehead.
[05:48.340 --> 05:50.460]  That was the only round I got a ball in.
[05:51.660 --> 05:53.960]  It clicked for me all at once.
[05:54.980 --> 05:56.120]  Mini Games 3!
[05:57.660 --> 05:58.460]  Oh, this shit.
[05:59.040 --> 05:59.780]  Don't hit the bomb!
[06:00.940 --> 06:01.880]  Somebody come to the right!
[06:03.580 --> 06:04.300]  Somebody come to the right!
[06:04.520 --> 06:05.400]  I'm coming to the right.
[06:05.720 --> 06:06.100]  Oh, it's a bomb!
[06:08.140 --> 06:08.500]  Sorry.
[06:10.620 --> 06:12.580]  I'm trying to lock in with you here,
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.480]  but it looks like Andrew's locked in with you here.
[06:14.660 --> 06:15.900]  So I'm just gonna let it be.
[06:16.280 --> 06:18.980]  It looks like you guys got a situation going.
[06:18.980 --> 06:21.600]  Wait for that to become apple-y.
[06:21.620 --> 06:22.020]  There you go!
[06:22.840 --> 06:23.160]  Nice.
[06:24.880 --> 06:26.180]  I don't think...
[06:27.220 --> 06:28.320]  Every ball's an apple.
[06:28.520 --> 06:30.200]  It looks like maybe you guys aren't on the same page.
[06:30.840 --> 06:31.700]  I'm trying.
[06:32.940 --> 06:34.060]  I'm trying.
[06:34.860 --> 06:35.300]  Oh!
[06:36.960 --> 06:37.880]  Team Lasso.
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.900]  You bombed me twice in a row!
[06:40.340 --> 06:42.340]  I do think that Andrew said,
[06:42.480 --> 06:45.160]  I think that was Geoff's fault.
[06:45.300 --> 06:46.220]  And that was pretty exciting.
[06:47.000 --> 06:47.840]  One of these, Nick!
[06:47.940 --> 06:48.440]  Get one of them!
[06:48.780 --> 06:52.080]  There you go!
[06:52.240 --> 06:52.500]  There you go!
[06:53.520 --> 06:54.860]  Dude, we were doing alright.
[06:56.500 --> 06:58.040]  The right side looked like it was
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.240]  maybe having a little trouble.
[07:00.340 --> 07:00.780]  Hey, Gavin!
[07:01.480 --> 07:03.000]  I don't feel like it was you, buddy.
[07:04.500 --> 07:04.740]  What?
[07:05.520 --> 07:06.400]  It was both of us.
[07:07.720 --> 07:08.620]  Okay, got one.
[07:08.840 --> 07:09.620]  Me and you, Gavin.
[07:11.940 --> 07:13.020]  We're killing it, Andrew!
[07:13.020 --> 07:13.540]  Killing it!
[07:14.580 --> 07:15.160]  Stay away!
[07:15.860 --> 07:16.480]  That was my bad.
[07:19.080 --> 07:20.380]  Hell yeah, man!
[07:20.940 --> 07:21.600]  Oh, watch out!
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.200]  That's what I'm talking about, Andrew!
[07:24.620 --> 07:25.760]  We're locked in.
[07:25.840 --> 07:27.420]  I'm gonna wait for this to de-bomb.
[07:28.020 --> 07:29.420]  Oh, perfect!
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.740]  I don't think I'm gonna make that one.
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.760]  Okay, I'm gonna get this one next.
[07:38.240 --> 07:38.640]  Ah!
[07:38.820 --> 07:39.240]  Too far!
[07:39.820 --> 07:40.300]  Ah!
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.420]  Sorry, good dodge.
[07:42.940 --> 07:44.240]  Okay, got that one.
[07:44.780 --> 07:45.160]  Get it!
[07:46.680 --> 07:47.640]  We good?
[07:49.020 --> 07:50.120]  There we go!
[07:51.280 --> 07:53.180]  I'm not gonna make it!
[07:53.340 --> 07:53.380]  Ah!
[07:57.290 --> 07:58.210]  You did great, Andrew.
[07:58.210 --> 07:59.450]  I felt like we were locked in, too.
[08:00.510 --> 08:02.010]  Oh, I'm on the ground now.
[08:02.130 --> 08:03.530]  It switched on us.
[08:04.370 --> 08:04.830]  It's gone.
[08:07.750 --> 08:08.230]  Uh...
[08:09.390 --> 08:10.510]  Don't look at me!
[08:10.590 --> 08:10.770]  Oh, no!
[08:11.650 --> 08:12.750]  Gavin, shoot it!
[08:14.170 --> 08:17.350]  I'm gonna leave it to you two over here on the right.
[08:17.450 --> 08:18.510]  You guys seem like you're locked in.
[08:19.090 --> 08:20.030]  Gavin, what'd you call us earlier?
[08:20.390 --> 08:20.870]  Sorry, I can't.
[08:22.070 --> 08:22.530]  That's okay.
[08:23.410 --> 08:24.110]  It's all good.
[08:24.910 --> 08:25.490]  There you go.
[08:25.810 --> 08:26.170]  Ah!
[08:29.330 --> 08:31.190]  It became a bomb as I shot it.
[08:31.530 --> 08:32.410]  I know, as you shot it.
[08:32.490 --> 08:33.710]  It wasn't your fault.
[08:33.710 --> 08:34.770]  Ah, damn.
[08:35.130 --> 08:37.410]  There we go.
[08:37.430 --> 08:37.630]  Ah!
[08:39.630 --> 08:40.950]  You can get that one.
[08:41.050 --> 08:41.510]  Got it!
[08:41.890 --> 08:44.670]  It was a good shot.
[08:45.090 --> 08:45.430]  That one?
[08:49.490 --> 08:50.090]  Three more.
[08:50.750 --> 08:51.590]  Two more.
[08:52.770 --> 08:53.690]  Let's do that one, Andrew.
[08:55.430 --> 08:56.050]  I'm up.
[08:56.550 --> 08:56.990]  Holy shit.
[08:59.170 --> 09:00.750]  Damn, hell yeah.
[09:00.750 --> 09:01.250]  Alright.
[09:02.550 --> 09:03.610]  Andrew, go to the right.
[09:05.570 --> 09:06.090]  Alright.
[09:08.130 --> 09:08.890]  Alright, Andrew.
[09:08.990 --> 09:09.550]  Good one.
[09:11.170 --> 09:11.670]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:12.910 --> 09:14.890]  Get it right down the middle.
[09:15.470 --> 09:16.310]  I'm watching you.
[09:16.790 --> 09:17.890]  It just took a weird hop.
[09:18.470 --> 09:18.990]  Nice.
[09:20.670 --> 09:21.890]  That's my bad.
[09:24.410 --> 09:26.110]  Got it? There you go.
[09:28.510 --> 09:29.030]  Nice.
[09:29.590 --> 09:30.110]  Nope.
[09:30.770 --> 09:31.290]  Perfect.
[09:34.950 --> 09:35.990]  I can't.
[09:36.170 --> 09:37.730]  I'm having fun shooting apples.
[09:38.250 --> 09:40.070]  What am I going to do?
[09:40.230 --> 09:42.270]  No one's catching them, but he's shooting them.
[09:42.630 --> 09:43.310]  You caught a couple.
[09:45.250 --> 09:45.810]  This is getting hard.
[09:46.330 --> 09:48.070]  Got it.
[09:48.830 --> 09:49.350]  Perfect.
[09:50.890 --> 09:51.790]  Good job, Geoff.
[09:52.690 --> 09:53.210]  Nice.
[09:55.170 --> 09:56.610]  How close were we?
[09:56.610 --> 09:57.670]  One away.
[09:58.030 --> 09:59.970]  This is very hard.
[10:01.170 --> 10:02.050]  They're moving fast.
[10:02.330 --> 10:03.270]  I'm on the ground.
[10:03.890 --> 10:05.730]  Why am I always shooting? I'm terrible.
[10:06.290 --> 10:07.070]  There we go.
[10:08.370 --> 10:09.790]  I'm sorry, that was my bad.
[10:10.350 --> 10:10.770]  That's okay.
[10:14.090 --> 10:18.090]  Nice, Geoff.
[10:18.450 --> 10:19.430]  You're a great shot, Andrew.
[10:19.650 --> 10:20.090]  There we go.
[10:22.290 --> 10:22.770]  Perfect.
[10:24.010 --> 10:25.470]  I'm glad I missed.
[10:26.230 --> 10:27.030]  Got it.
[10:27.150 --> 10:27.610]  Holy shit.
[10:28.090 --> 10:29.690]  I'm just trying to get these bombs out of the middle.
[10:32.950 --> 10:36.130]  Ignore anything in the middle.
[10:36.250 --> 10:37.450]  I'm just trying to get these bombs out of the middle.
[10:37.630 --> 10:39.510]  I'm trying to get these bombs out of the middle.
[10:39.790 --> 10:40.090]  I'm just trying to get these bombs out of the middle.
[10:40.090 --> 10:40.750]  I think that was an apple.
[10:41.910 --> 10:42.750]  That was me.
[10:43.470 --> 10:44.090]  I shot on the wrong side.
[10:44.470 --> 10:44.970]  Nice shot.
[10:45.790 --> 10:46.870]  Don't worry about that one.
[10:48.350 --> 10:49.550]  Don't worry about those.
[10:49.550 --> 10:50.090]  Two more.
[10:50.470 --> 10:51.410]  One more.
[10:53.030 --> 10:54.130]  It's going to be an apple.
[10:55.630 --> 10:57.010]  God damn it.
[10:57.370 --> 10:58.550]  Son of a bitch.
[10:59.890 --> 11:01.930]  Andrew, I don't know how much better we can do.
[11:02.270 --> 11:03.790]  I only missed two apples.
[11:05.130 --> 11:06.170]  I'm on the left this time.
[11:06.890 --> 11:07.970]  I'm on the right.
[11:09.050 --> 11:09.510]  Oh boy.
[11:09.730 --> 11:11.630]  I got one, two...
[11:11.630 --> 11:12.630]  Oh boy.
[11:13.910 --> 11:14.930]  Who's shooting me?
[11:15.970 --> 11:16.910]  Are you orange?
[11:16.910 --> 11:17.730]  Who's green?
[11:17.830 --> 11:19.670]  Yeah, it's me.
[11:19.830 --> 11:20.610]  You're doing good.
[11:23.530 --> 11:25.510]  I have a good thing going right now.
[11:25.550 --> 11:27.090]  I was on a run and then I blew it.
[11:27.470 --> 11:27.970]  Go left.
[11:28.750 --> 11:29.790]  Here we go.
[11:30.230 --> 11:31.450]  Right in front of me.
[11:32.230 --> 11:33.390]  There we go.
[11:34.890 --> 11:36.050]  Here comes low.
[11:37.070 --> 11:37.450]  Good.
[11:38.870 --> 11:39.210]  Perfect.
[11:40.390 --> 11:42.070]  Here comes one more.
[11:42.070 --> 11:43.590]  Let's get the cup back.
[11:45.530 --> 11:46.350]  We got it.
[11:46.790 --> 11:48.550]  Go, go, go.
[11:50.910 --> 11:51.710]  Good job.
[11:53.050 --> 11:55.510]  Guys, I want to thank you for watching.
[11:55.770 --> 11:56.730]  We're going to 501.
[11:56.830 --> 11:57.710]  I really appreciate it.
[12:01.390 --> 12:02.890]  That was insane.
[12:03.410 --> 12:04.230]  That's a tough one.
[12:04.310 --> 12:04.870]  Those are tough.
[12:06.290 --> 12:09.510]  I'm glad we don't have to shoot more apples off our heads or snowballs or whatever.
[12:09.830 --> 12:10.410]  What are we doing now?
[12:10.410 --> 12:10.850]  Here we go.
[12:12.250 --> 12:13.330]  Way to go.
[12:14.630 --> 12:16.450]  Hi, Geoff. Remember where you were, man.
[12:16.630 --> 12:17.590]  We got this back.
[12:17.990 --> 12:20.410]  You can barely do this without...
[12:21.010 --> 12:21.530]  Oh, shit.
[12:24.890 --> 12:26.310]  That was pretty good, man.
[12:27.030 --> 12:27.570]  I had a thought.
[12:27.690 --> 12:28.970]  I just didn't have the ability to speak it.
[12:29.510 --> 12:31.150]  Get bumps to the cranium.
[12:31.630 --> 12:33.490]  I'm constantly getting done in.
[12:35.470 --> 12:36.110]  Dammit, Geoff.
[12:36.250 --> 12:37.450]  I want to die.
[12:37.450 --> 12:38.690]  Dammit, Geoff.
[12:40.090 --> 12:43.330]  Man, the bombs will freak you the fuck out.
[12:44.970 --> 12:47.330]  Come on, you...
[12:50.150 --> 12:50.890]  Goalkeeper.
[12:51.270 --> 12:51.930]  Terrible.
[12:52.290 --> 12:53.410]  Can you get off me?
[12:53.890 --> 12:54.630]  Sorry.
[12:57.870 --> 12:59.050]  Too high.
[13:00.910 --> 13:01.650]  Dammit.
[13:02.570 --> 13:03.530]  Too much.
[13:03.790 --> 13:04.190]  Too much.
[13:04.190 --> 13:04.830]  Too much.
[13:05.190 --> 13:06.930]  There we go.
[13:09.330 --> 13:10.470]  There we go.
[13:10.530 --> 13:12.170]  Oh, you can move after you've charged it?
[13:12.410 --> 13:12.890]  I'm a schmuck.
[13:13.950 --> 13:14.970]  There we go.
[13:15.090 --> 13:16.310]  You didn't know that?
[13:16.630 --> 13:19.550]  No, I didn't.
[13:22.590 --> 13:23.790]  Well, it's a nice run.
[13:23.810 --> 13:24.370]  Two more.
[13:25.250 --> 13:26.110]  One more.
[13:26.690 --> 13:28.770]  We got it on the next one.
[13:28.870 --> 13:31.710]  Gavin knows you can move after you charge it, so he's got it now.
[13:31.710 --> 13:33.470]  Now we're all set.
[13:38.570 --> 13:39.250]  Nice.
[13:39.430 --> 13:40.910]  Thank you.
[13:41.430 --> 13:42.390]  Oh, come on.
[13:42.750 --> 13:45.170]  Get in!
[13:45.410 --> 13:47.130]  You sexy idiot.
[13:47.850 --> 13:48.670]  Oh, way too far.
[13:49.410 --> 13:50.770]  Why'd you do that, Geoff?
[13:51.950 --> 13:53.570]  Oh, that was so close, Eric.
[13:54.410 --> 13:55.090]  Goddamn.
[13:56.450 --> 13:57.130]  Brutal.
[13:57.630 --> 13:58.010]  Brutal.
[13:59.310 --> 13:59.790]  Nice.
[13:59.930 --> 14:00.810]  Good shot, Purple.
[14:02.030 --> 14:03.530]  One more. You got it.
[14:04.570 --> 14:05.350]  Bad angle.
[14:05.710 --> 14:07.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:07.890 --> 14:09.730]  Oh, what an arc, dude.
[14:09.850 --> 14:10.710]  That was awesome.
[14:19.200 --> 14:19.540]  Hey.
[14:21.020 --> 14:21.500]  Dammit.
[14:22.200 --> 14:22.640]  No!
[14:23.800 --> 14:26.000]  There we go. Go, go, go.
[14:26.480 --> 14:26.880]  Get in!
[14:30.370 --> 14:31.630]  Someone get a three-pointer.
[14:32.150 --> 14:33.250]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[14:33.910 --> 14:35.670]  I'm the Celtics.
[14:41.840 --> 14:43.000]  Glad that's done with.
[14:43.360 --> 14:44.700]  Good job with minigames.
[14:44.960 --> 14:45.960]  That's a chief.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.640]  We did it, baby. Moving on.
[14:50.440 --> 14:51.680]  Moving on, baby.
[14:52.100 --> 14:53.680]  In the rear-view mirror.
[14:54.960 --> 14:56.780]  Top-down view.
[14:57.460 --> 14:58.840]  Don't know about this.
[14:59.420 --> 15:01.880]  Is it like the second level of Contra?
[15:02.500 --> 15:02.780]  What?
[15:04.340 --> 15:04.780]  Oh!
[15:05.200 --> 15:05.980]  What'd you die of?
[15:06.900 --> 15:07.680]  You killed a map.
[15:09.140 --> 15:11.320]  Oh, it's like a...
[15:11.320 --> 15:12.240]  Oh, you can't...
[15:12.240 --> 15:14.320]  Oh, if you touch the black, it's like falling in a hole.
[15:14.740 --> 15:15.080]  Got it.
[15:16.220 --> 15:17.520]  The black's a hole.
[15:19.320 --> 15:21.340]  Geoff, anytime you wanna go, that'd be great.
[15:21.440 --> 15:22.840]  Anytime. Anytime, buddy.
[15:23.220 --> 15:25.060]  What did I...
[15:25.060 --> 15:25.320]  What?
[15:25.960 --> 15:26.860]  Fell in the black.
[15:27.520 --> 15:29.440]  Guys, do you have a shadow? Look at your shadow.
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.460]  My shadow!
[15:31.140 --> 15:32.140]  Use your shadow.
[15:34.080 --> 15:35.340]  It tells you where you are.
[15:35.780 --> 15:36.320]  Somebody hit that.
[15:37.480 --> 15:38.600]  I'm on top of my shadow.
[15:39.580 --> 15:40.860]  Oh, my God. Hit the button.
[15:42.620 --> 15:43.760]  Just... what a moron.
[15:43.840 --> 15:44.460]  I don't know, man.
[15:44.640 --> 15:44.980]  Me?
[15:47.760 --> 15:49.320]  Nick was saying, look at my shadow.
[15:49.460 --> 15:50.060]  It lets you know where you are.
[15:50.180 --> 15:53.060]  Use your shadow as an opportunity to see where you are.
[15:53.060 --> 15:53.800]  Hang on.
[15:55.380 --> 15:57.600]  Get three on there, I'll be the fourth.
[15:58.060 --> 15:58.640]  Are you gonna be bait?
[15:59.080 --> 15:59.640]  It's mousetrap.
[16:00.240 --> 16:00.820]  I can be bait.
[16:03.440 --> 16:04.240]  But, like...
[16:06.040 --> 16:07.020]  I'll bait him.
[16:08.500 --> 16:09.100]  Get in his cone.
[16:09.520 --> 16:11.500]  Okay, ready? I'm gonna get him in a second.
[16:11.680 --> 16:12.500]  Okay, go for it.
[16:13.600 --> 16:14.940]  Why do you keep trying to trap Andrew?
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.040]  I'm not trying to.
[16:16.540 --> 16:17.020]  Get him!
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.060]  No!
[16:18.060 --> 16:18.420]  Nice!
[16:21.140 --> 16:21.540]  Okay.
[16:22.100 --> 16:23.120]  Well, it worked pretty well.
[16:23.400 --> 16:24.180]  Aside from Andrew dying.
[16:25.720 --> 16:28.080]  I don't like that you framed that like it was my fault.
[16:28.400 --> 16:29.220]  No, no, no, no.
[16:29.400 --> 16:31.540]  No, but it did work well aside from you dying.
[16:31.540 --> 16:32.000]  It did.
[16:32.380 --> 16:34.280]  Nobody assigned blame to the death.
[16:35.260 --> 16:36.700]  That was just the point where it went wrong.
[16:39.620 --> 16:39.960]  Okay.
[16:40.460 --> 16:41.480]  We doing the same thing or what?
[16:41.780 --> 16:41.940]  Yeah.
[16:44.320 --> 16:46.320]  If it don't work, don't fix it.
[16:48.700 --> 16:49.380]  Oops.
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.260]  Are you kidding me?
[16:51.880 --> 16:52.260]  I'm sorry.
[16:52.500 --> 16:52.980]  That's pretty precise.
[16:53.140 --> 16:54.140]  That's all good.
[16:54.300 --> 16:56.220]  Hair early.
[16:56.920 --> 16:57.440]  Buttercage.
[17:03.810 --> 17:05.210]  That freaks me out.
[17:05.250 --> 17:05.590]  Who died?
[17:07.790 --> 17:08.470]  Huh?
[17:13.570 --> 17:13.870]  Okay.
[17:14.130 --> 17:14.830]  Whenever you're ready.
[17:17.130 --> 17:17.670]  Nice.
[17:18.170 --> 17:18.450]  Go for it, Andrew.
[17:18.450 --> 17:19.150]  Yep.
[17:20.690 --> 17:22.090]  BMW just texted me.
[17:22.630 --> 17:23.610]  Oh my God.
[17:24.390 --> 17:25.890]  Way to go, Geoff.
[17:26.310 --> 17:27.570]  Geoff, were you looking at your phone?
[17:27.910 --> 17:30.870]  No, I was looking at Andrew with the key.
[17:31.070 --> 17:32.030]  One more time.
[17:32.270 --> 17:34.190]  I was watching Andrew run with the key.
[17:34.550 --> 17:37.050]  And I just kept going forward.
[17:38.010 --> 17:38.470]  Oh.
[17:39.110 --> 17:39.670]  That was dumb.
[17:39.730 --> 17:41.490]  I said watch out for the black, though.
[17:43.410 --> 17:44.250]  Wasn't that bad.
[17:44.530 --> 17:46.010]  I was watching Andrew watch out for the black.
[17:46.010 --> 17:47.370]  Wasn't that good, bud?
[17:48.370 --> 17:49.930]  I got really nervous for a second there.
[17:50.390 --> 17:51.870]  Here we go.
[17:53.410 --> 17:54.090]  Easy.
[17:54.490 --> 17:55.130]  Perforation.
[17:56.030 --> 17:56.930]  Nobody go.
[17:57.990 --> 17:59.010]  Let Andrew go first.
[18:00.710 --> 18:02.810]  I don't want to let Geoff go first.
[18:03.050 --> 18:03.410]  Alright.
[18:03.630 --> 18:04.770]  Let Nick go first.
[18:05.110 --> 18:07.010]  Let Gavin go first.
[18:07.170 --> 18:07.750]  See ya.
[18:12.290 --> 18:13.370]  No buncing.
[18:13.370 --> 18:13.450]  That was dumb.
[18:15.490 --> 18:17.150]  Be very careful at the door.
[18:19.090 --> 18:19.250]  Woo!
[18:20.730 --> 18:21.230]  Woo!
[18:22.710 --> 18:25.270]  Oh, BMW texted me.
[18:25.430 --> 18:25.770]  Die.
[18:27.770 --> 18:29.350]  I can just hear the sound
[18:29.350 --> 18:30.610]  of a text being opened.
[18:30.890 --> 18:31.890]  I have a car again.
[18:32.430 --> 18:35.410]  Oh, we have to keep them in the net.
[18:35.930 --> 18:36.230]  Oh.
[18:36.370 --> 18:37.870]  How do we make the net real?
[18:38.650 --> 18:39.670]  There we go.
[18:39.670 --> 18:40.130]  For real?
[18:42.450 --> 18:43.710]  Seems like we have to stay in position.
[18:43.730 --> 18:45.910]  Let's all focus on one at a time.
[18:46.030 --> 18:46.430]  There we go.
[18:48.210 --> 18:49.510]  Let's get this one.
[18:50.270 --> 18:51.070]  There's two.
[18:51.490 --> 18:52.450]  Let's move to the right.
[18:53.630 --> 18:54.910]  Focus on just one.
[18:55.550 --> 18:55.950]  Nope.
[18:57.370 --> 18:58.030]  There we go.
[18:58.070 --> 18:58.730]  Which one are we doing?
[18:59.110 --> 18:59.970]  The one on the left.
[19:01.330 --> 19:04.790]  Perfect. Up top.
[19:05.270 --> 19:05.510]  This one.
[19:05.510 --> 19:06.150]  Here we go.
[19:06.990 --> 19:08.030]  I'm going to do this one again.
[19:08.170 --> 19:10.290]  I'm going to be really easy next time.
[19:10.630 --> 19:11.030]  Easy.
[19:12.630 --> 19:14.430]  We didn't know what we were doing for half the timer.
[19:15.810 --> 19:16.910]  We still got four of six.
[19:17.990 --> 19:19.710]  Man, people keep posting the 501 thing
[19:19.710 --> 19:21.250]  in the chat and it's really confusing me.
[19:22.750 --> 19:23.410]  There we go.
[19:23.790 --> 19:24.830]  Let's just spread out more.
[19:25.230 --> 19:25.850]  Get fucked.
[19:27.070 --> 19:28.030]  There you go.
[19:28.350 --> 19:29.010]  Get all this shit.
[19:29.730 --> 19:30.390]  Two of them.
[19:30.390 --> 19:30.650]  There you go.
[19:30.730 --> 19:30.950]  Down.
[19:35.150 --> 19:36.110]  Get big.
[19:38.610 --> 19:40.410]  Where do you think you're going, Butterfly?
[19:40.550 --> 19:41.070]  Up left.
[19:46.030 --> 19:47.430]  We got it. Go.
[19:47.530 --> 19:49.050]  Go up.
[19:50.270 --> 19:51.230]  Door's up.
[19:52.330 --> 19:53.230]  We did it.
[19:55.650 --> 19:57.450]  We got a net caught in the door.
[19:59.290 --> 20:00.010]  Somebody said,
[20:00.150 --> 20:01.110]  this has gotten a lot more complicated
[20:01.110 --> 20:02.770]  since I last watched. No shit.
[20:03.690 --> 20:04.170]  I agree.
[20:09.810 --> 20:11.430]  Press X button to hide.
[20:11.830 --> 20:13.110]  Only one player.
[20:14.450 --> 20:15.050]  I'm in a box.
[20:16.750 --> 20:17.610]  Can we all
[20:17.610 --> 20:18.470]  hide under the thing?
[20:19.010 --> 20:20.890]  Yeah, but if you start moving...
[20:20.890 --> 20:22.590]  Alright, watch this.
[20:24.610 --> 20:25.370]  Get under.
[20:26.150 --> 20:26.630]  Oh.
[20:27.670 --> 20:29.570]  So Gavin, what...
[20:29.570 --> 20:30.890]  Did you...
[20:30.890 --> 20:31.690]  What happened?
[20:32.270 --> 20:33.370]  Where did the box go?
[20:34.730 --> 20:35.970]  Alright, I'm going to box now.
[20:37.050 --> 20:39.290]  Maybe after they see you, you can't do it.
[20:39.330 --> 20:40.770]  Yeah, I think I was too late on the box.
[20:41.690 --> 20:42.630]  Box, box, box.
[20:43.570 --> 20:44.310]  Alright, check this out.
[20:45.730 --> 20:46.210]  Boxing.
[20:46.670 --> 20:47.170]  Hit it now.
[20:47.570 --> 20:48.730]  I can't box over there.
[20:49.510 --> 20:52.510]  Maybe the box jumps around.
[20:52.510 --> 20:53.870]  Oh, random box.
[20:54.030 --> 20:54.950]  Find out who has the box.
[20:56.910 --> 20:57.730]  Geoff has it.
[20:58.290 --> 20:58.550]  Nice.
[21:01.050 --> 21:02.230]  Do we want to get in this box?
[21:02.430 --> 21:02.590]  Yep.
[21:07.800 --> 21:09.100]  Ready? Go.
[21:10.800 --> 21:11.480]  Oh boy, that's hard.
[21:11.480 --> 21:11.780]  What are you doing?
[21:12.800 --> 21:15.900]  We can't leave without the box being moved.
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.540]  Yeah, I mean, I gotta move the box.
[21:18.120 --> 21:18.600]  Who's got it?
[21:18.960 --> 21:19.760]  Not me.
[21:20.660 --> 21:23.040]  Alright, hold on.
[21:23.040 --> 21:24.460]  I'm going to wait until the...
[21:25.040 --> 21:25.600]  And... go.
[21:27.360 --> 21:29.200]  We're going to have to edge like a bastard.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.580]  Okay, ready? Go.
[21:33.540 --> 21:34.420]  Oh, sh...
[21:34.920 --> 21:36.300]  It's hard to drop it again, right?
[21:37.080 --> 21:38.560]  You gotta re-box real quick.
[21:39.220 --> 21:40.340]  It doesn't let you.
[21:40.560 --> 21:42.160]  Okay, I got it.
[21:42.440 --> 21:44.040]  That's your boxing speed.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.760]  You guys just wait a minute?
[21:46.220 --> 21:46.340]  Yeah.
[21:50.000 --> 21:50.780]  Shit, sorry.
[21:50.780 --> 21:54.020]  I was trying to get to the middle so it could just be one rotation.
[21:54.220 --> 21:55.520]  Geoff, I need you to wait a minute.
[21:55.980 --> 21:57.180]  I'm waiting.
[21:57.880 --> 21:59.020]  I don't have it anymore.
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.040]  No, I don't want it.
[22:01.080 --> 22:02.840]  I don't want that fucking box.
[22:03.580 --> 22:04.780]  What's in the box?
[22:05.340 --> 22:06.180]  It's Nick's stress.
[22:07.280 --> 22:08.040]  Yeah, really.
[22:09.120 --> 22:09.320]  Go!
[22:10.240 --> 22:13.440]  I fell right off. I didn't realize I was so low.
[22:13.680 --> 22:14.860]  That was very strange.
[22:16.120 --> 22:16.600]  Gavin has it.
[22:16.960 --> 22:18.560]  This is really weird.
[22:18.560 --> 22:19.920]  Fuck, I'm still in jail!
[22:26.340 --> 22:27.440]  Andrew has it.
[22:27.740 --> 22:28.900]  I got it? Fuck.
[22:30.520 --> 22:32.120]  You stopped my box.
[22:36.220 --> 22:37.740]  Do you want us to calm?
[22:38.420 --> 22:39.900]  I mean, that's up to you.
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.320]  Three, two...
[22:41.320 --> 22:44.120]  As soon as they turn their heads again...
[22:45.780 --> 22:46.660]  Okay, that...
[22:46.660 --> 22:48.040]  Oh, what a move!
[22:48.040 --> 22:49.060]  Holy shit!
[22:50.860 --> 22:52.060]  Get in the box!
[22:52.660 --> 22:53.440]  Way to go, Nick!
[22:53.500 --> 22:54.380]  Way to go, Gavin!
[22:56.000 --> 22:56.840]  Good work, boys.
[22:58.540 --> 23:00.200]  I have the box.
[23:01.060 --> 23:02.360]  We could all just hold right.
[23:02.860 --> 23:02.940]  Geoff!
[23:04.440 --> 23:06.980]  We don't have to worry about the box.
[23:08.500 --> 23:09.520]  Do you think that was me?
[23:09.960 --> 23:11.520]  Okay, Andrew has the box.
[23:11.960 --> 23:13.880]  Everyone on the inside of the box can just hold right.
[23:14.000 --> 23:14.960]  And then it's on the other box.
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.520]  I'm gonna wait until they turn.
[23:17.400 --> 23:17.800]  Go.
[23:19.860 --> 23:20.760]  Careful of the black.
[23:20.960 --> 23:22.720]  And then once they turn...
[23:22.720 --> 23:23.360]  Go.
[23:26.520 --> 23:26.920]  Nice.
[23:28.700 --> 23:29.100]  Box!
[23:32.400 --> 23:33.100]  That's on me.
[23:33.240 --> 23:34.200]  That's my bad. Sorry.
[23:34.900 --> 23:36.620]  Wait, how's that not on Eric?
[23:37.320 --> 23:38.600]  What do you mean? I was way ahead.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.160]  I wasn't doing anything.
[23:40.260 --> 23:41.500]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[23:41.500 --> 23:43.740]  You lost the safety of the box, though.
[23:43.780 --> 23:44.820]  You screwed up the box plan.
[23:45.460 --> 23:46.600]  Ah, shit. Am I the bot?
[23:46.620 --> 23:48.860]  I was past where we needed the box, bud.
[23:49.740 --> 23:50.620]  Yeah, he was safe.
[23:50.820 --> 23:52.100]  What are you talking about?
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.680]  Alright, you guys ready?
[23:54.880 --> 23:55.960]  Alright, here we go, guys.
[23:56.380 --> 23:57.340]  Alright, here we go.
[23:59.140 --> 24:02.240]  Oh, no!
[24:03.840 --> 24:05.260]  Alright, everybody line up.
[24:05.680 --> 24:05.880]  Okay.
[24:07.220 --> 24:08.140]  I'm gonna go again. You ready?
[24:08.140 --> 24:08.620]  Yep.
[24:10.600 --> 24:11.440]  Love it.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.420]  I'm holding right, I'm holding right.
[24:13.600 --> 24:15.740]  They fucking didn't all go at the same time!
[24:18.320 --> 24:19.040]  I went.
[24:20.400 --> 24:21.720]  Oh, it's Gabby's box.
[24:22.500 --> 24:23.340]  Alright, ready?
[24:24.120 --> 24:24.340]  Yep.
[24:25.300 --> 24:25.500]  Oh.
[24:27.800 --> 24:29.540]  Wait. Oh, this is a mess.
[24:29.800 --> 24:30.400]  Okay, go!
[24:33.980 --> 24:34.460]  Go!
[24:35.300 --> 24:35.860]  Alright, don't.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.280]  Don't rush me.
[24:48.250 --> 24:49.870]  I appreciate the confidence.
[24:51.690 --> 24:52.030]  Alright.
[24:52.130 --> 24:53.070]  Guess we have to wait until they go back.
[24:53.070 --> 24:54.810]  Alright, it's Daddy's box. Here we go. Hang on.
[24:55.270 --> 24:56.290]  Ready? Yep.
[24:57.470 --> 24:58.150]  Don't wake Daddy.
[25:00.510 --> 25:01.470]  Alright, everyone hold right.
[25:01.990 --> 25:02.430]  Holding right.
[25:05.790 --> 25:07.230]  I'm just making sure you guys don't go anywhere.
[25:07.230 --> 25:09.230]  Oh, shit, where are ya?
[25:09.890 --> 25:10.050]  Get!
[25:10.990 --> 25:12.230]  I need you to go all the way back.
[25:14.890 --> 25:17.670]  I thought you didn't dive for the box, you just ran all the way back.
[25:18.130 --> 25:19.970]  Well, wouldn't they have killed us in the box anyway?
[25:21.010 --> 25:21.270]  Nope.
[25:21.690 --> 25:22.850]  No? Oh.
[25:24.330 --> 25:24.530]  Sorry.
[25:24.850 --> 25:25.750]  There's safety in the box.
[25:26.190 --> 25:27.930]  Ready? Yep.
[25:28.090 --> 25:28.750]  Watch me!
[25:31.410 --> 25:34.430]  Not sure how we're getting worse at this point, but it's pretty exciting to see.
[25:34.430 --> 25:35.610]  You said ready and then didn't go.
[25:35.610 --> 25:36.750]  I'm just getting ready to go.
[25:38.230 --> 25:39.190]  That's my box again.
[25:39.290 --> 25:40.530]  Just stay behind me.
[25:41.850 --> 25:46.150]  Now, what if instead, Andrew, what if in front?
[25:47.310 --> 25:48.410]  I don't think it'll work.
[25:49.390 --> 25:49.950]  Oh, okay.
[25:51.410 --> 25:53.270]  If you say so, man, I don't know.
[25:54.530 --> 25:56.070]  Alright, next one. Yep.
[25:58.570 --> 25:59.750]  That's fucking blue!
[26:00.750 --> 26:02.190]  I hit X, nothing's happening!
[26:02.350 --> 26:03.230]  Was it not me this time?
[26:03.230 --> 26:04.310]  I think it was, wasn't it?
[26:05.110 --> 26:05.990]  Top left?
[26:06.210 --> 26:07.850]  It's always top left.
[26:07.890 --> 26:10.230]  Top left?
[26:10.930 --> 26:11.370]  Yeah.
[26:11.790 --> 26:14.130]  I don't know what's confusing about that.
[26:14.270 --> 26:15.190]  The top left starter.
[26:17.110 --> 26:17.930]  Oh, fuck!
[26:21.770 --> 26:23.350]  See, now it should be Geoff, right?
[26:24.750 --> 26:25.790]  There you go.
[26:26.410 --> 26:27.530]  Alright, you little bitches wanna go?
[26:28.610 --> 26:29.210]  Oh, I can't.
[26:31.410 --> 26:31.810]  Alright.
[26:34.350 --> 26:35.990]  C041H, this is so infuriating.
[26:36.210 --> 26:37.270]  Imagine doing it.
[26:37.530 --> 26:39.170]  Yeah, it's way worse to be us.
[26:39.390 --> 26:40.190]  Wait, Gavin!
[26:40.890 --> 26:42.010]  I'm with ya.
[26:45.580 --> 26:46.320]  Okay, ready?
[26:46.500 --> 26:47.080]  Everyone hold right.
[26:49.460 --> 26:50.360]  Oh, go, box!
[26:50.520 --> 26:51.620]  Oh, come on!
[26:51.820 --> 26:53.320]  It wouldn't let me throw the box after we were spotted.
[26:54.260 --> 26:54.880]  Is that true?
[26:56.000 --> 26:56.280]  Yeah.
[26:57.320 --> 26:58.000]  Daddy's box.
[26:59.920 --> 27:01.020]  Way to go, Gavin!
[27:02.580 --> 27:03.540]  Thank you.
[27:04.780 --> 27:05.260]  Awesome.
[27:08.300 --> 27:09.000]  Daddy's box.
[27:11.100 --> 27:12.260]  Here we go.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.120]  Waiting for the next cycle.
[27:16.220 --> 27:17.720]  Everyone hold right. Watch the black.
[27:18.900 --> 27:19.000]  Go.
[27:20.320 --> 27:21.440]  Clump of victory.
[27:21.620 --> 27:22.840]  Hang on, Gavin! Come back!
[27:24.420 --> 27:25.180]  Hang on.
[27:25.260 --> 27:25.580]  Wait.
[27:26.360 --> 27:26.920]  Gavin!
[27:28.440 --> 27:30.380]  What is your problem?
[27:30.700 --> 27:31.320]  I was in there.
[27:31.440 --> 27:32.840]  Why would you leave?
[27:33.640 --> 27:35.360]  You don't have the box!
[27:35.700 --> 27:37.260]  I can't leave.
[27:37.620 --> 27:39.540]  Get ready.
[27:40.160 --> 27:41.640]  Ready? Go.
[27:42.620 --> 27:44.800]  The only way I can leave the box is if you lift the box.
[27:48.620 --> 27:49.700]  Oh, boy.
[27:49.700 --> 27:50.920]  I thought I did.
[27:51.100 --> 27:52.620]  You got it, Andrew.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.100]  Gavin wants to be at the front of the pile so bad.
[27:57.340 --> 27:57.960]  It's crazy.
[27:58.700 --> 27:59.800]  I don't want to be left behind again.
[28:02.040 --> 28:03.720]  See how I can't leave the box?
[28:04.180 --> 28:06.120]  I said lead, not leave.
[28:06.380 --> 28:06.900]  Lead.
[28:07.340 --> 28:09.160]  How can you lead a box?
[28:09.700 --> 28:10.060]  Nice.
[28:13.080 --> 28:14.420]  Why do you want to lead?
[28:14.440 --> 28:15.180]  Let's wait.
[28:15.180 --> 28:15.360]  Wait.
[28:15.380 --> 28:18.340]  You're wrong.
[28:18.500 --> 28:20.460]  Play the tape.
[28:21.220 --> 28:22.060]  Wait.
[28:23.740 --> 28:24.420]  Let him go back.
[28:24.840 --> 28:25.100]  Go.
[28:26.340 --> 28:28.220]  We're going to die.
[28:28.860 --> 28:30.560]  What are you doing?
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.160]  We have to get a little closer.
[28:34.320 --> 28:36.220]  Wait until they come across.
[28:36.820 --> 28:36.980]  Wait.
[28:37.640 --> 28:39.460]  Go to the right.
[28:40.060 --> 28:40.700]  No!
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.700]  You killed us!
[28:43.220 --> 28:44.520]  You were just a little quick.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.560]  Daddy's box.
[28:47.960 --> 28:49.900]  You guys have to go down.
[28:50.280 --> 28:51.300]  I have to get the key.
[28:51.660 --> 28:52.500]  I think we should all get the key.
[28:52.640 --> 28:55.480]  I don't care what you think.
[28:56.180 --> 28:57.700]  Their vision encompasses too much.
[28:57.900 --> 28:58.480]  They see all.
[28:59.920 --> 29:00.420]  Oh, wow.
[29:02.860 --> 29:03.960]  Here we go.
[29:07.260 --> 29:07.940]  Hang on.
[29:07.940 --> 29:09.680]  Let me get to the top.
[29:11.680 --> 29:13.680]  Gavin, I know desperately you want to be at the top.
[29:13.980 --> 29:15.260]  I don't know why you're doing that.
[29:16.560 --> 29:17.440]  Doing what?
[29:21.740 --> 29:23.620]  If we are going down,
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.920]  we have to go very low.
[29:26.180 --> 29:27.980]  Yes, you guys have to go
[29:27.980 --> 29:28.700]  very low.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.600]  You want us all to go different directions?
[29:31.400 --> 29:34.080]  You guys are going to go right and down
[29:34.080 --> 29:35.260]  as low as you can go.
[29:35.880 --> 29:37.620]  I'm going to go right and get the key.
[29:38.340 --> 29:39.320]  Are you ready?
[29:39.840 --> 29:40.380]  I'm ready.
[29:40.940 --> 29:47.500]  I don't know
[29:47.500 --> 29:49.660]  what's confusing about what all that was.
[29:50.020 --> 29:51.000]  It's not confusing.
[29:51.140 --> 29:52.360]  We all have to wait for you anyway.
[29:52.500 --> 29:53.260]  Why don't we all just go?
[29:54.580 --> 29:57.200]  Why don't we all just have the chance to get spotted
[29:57.200 --> 29:57.900]  by the bat?
[29:59.880 --> 30:00.780]  That's what you're saying.
[30:02.040 --> 30:03.540]  Four people get clear.
[30:03.540 --> 30:05.160]  I mean, here's the thing, Gavin.
[30:05.240 --> 30:06.340]  It doesn't matter. I was right.
[30:06.820 --> 30:07.660]  What are we doing?
[30:08.860 --> 30:11.640]  I think Gavin's concern was that the bats
[30:11.640 --> 30:13.760]  also could have had a vision long enough
[30:13.760 --> 30:15.140]  to see us down there.
[30:16.360 --> 30:17.540]  Here's the thing. It doesn't matter.
[30:17.620 --> 30:17.960]  I was right.
[30:19.580 --> 30:21.260]  Wait, wait, wait.
[30:21.300 --> 30:21.840]  Stop, stop, stop.
[30:23.400 --> 30:25.220]  Do we spread out
[30:25.220 --> 30:28.020]  or do we go all in one line?
[30:28.600 --> 30:29.780]  I think we should try
[30:29.780 --> 30:31.720]  going in one line in order.
[30:31.720 --> 30:33.680]  Blue or orange first.
[30:34.100 --> 30:36.640]  Okay, because I'm worried
[30:36.640 --> 30:37.920]  that we're going to get up here
[30:37.920 --> 30:39.120]  and we're going to have to come back
[30:39.120 --> 30:40.780]  because there's going to be switches we have to hit.
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.920]  I'm worried that I won't be able to go to the left
[30:43.920 --> 30:46.000]  without pulling Andrew into the abyss.
[30:46.840 --> 30:47.060]  Yep.
[30:47.940 --> 30:50.320]  So that's what I was worried about.
[30:51.140 --> 30:52.980]  Okay, let's line up.
[30:53.080 --> 30:53.440]  Alright.
[30:53.900 --> 30:55.560]  So we don't die, it looks like.
[30:55.660 --> 30:56.500]  Okay, we're all going to go up.
[30:56.800 --> 30:58.200]  I'm getting tugged.
[30:58.200 --> 30:59.740]  Take it easy.
[31:00.060 --> 31:00.880]  Chill the beans.
[31:01.200 --> 31:02.480]  Left, left, up.
[31:03.520 --> 31:05.260]  You almost had it, Geoff. You're alright.
[31:06.140 --> 31:08.080]  This doesn't seem that hard. I shouldn't have said that.
[31:08.180 --> 31:08.460]  I'm sorry.
[31:10.100 --> 31:12.480]  Guys, this one's actually
[31:12.480 --> 31:13.200]  an easy one.
[31:14.280 --> 31:15.200]  Stop tugging me.
[31:16.820 --> 31:18.560]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[31:18.580 --> 31:19.380]  Geoff's already up there.
[31:20.240 --> 31:20.880]  I hit the button.
[31:21.540 --> 31:23.000]  Geoff, you're flying!
[31:23.460 --> 31:24.540]  Check this out. What if...
[31:24.540 --> 31:25.040]  Fuck you.
[31:25.780 --> 31:28.340]  The faster you go, the easier it is
[31:28.340 --> 31:29.100]  on this stuff.
[31:30.180 --> 31:30.960]  Is that right?
[31:31.400 --> 31:33.100]  Here we go, the fast way.
[31:34.140 --> 31:36.080]  I'm getting tugged senseless.
[31:36.340 --> 31:37.260]  Why are we doing this?
[31:37.620 --> 31:37.940]  I'm dead.
[31:38.820 --> 31:41.280]  It was working for me, I lived.
[31:42.280 --> 31:43.640]  That's true, Geoff did make it.
[31:45.700 --> 31:46.500]  I didn't do it that time.
[31:50.880 --> 31:52.300]  Alright, let's try slower again.
[31:55.620 --> 31:56.900]  You guys wanna try slower?
[31:57.080 --> 31:58.180]  I cut a corner.
[31:59.500 --> 32:00.600]  That's the first time
[32:00.600 --> 32:02.540]  it's been on me the whole game.
[32:04.440 --> 32:05.340]  That was me.
[32:05.820 --> 32:07.120]  I got my switch.
[32:12.080 --> 32:12.560]  Gavin.
[32:17.940 --> 32:18.980]  I got my switch.
[32:22.220 --> 32:22.940]  I've never
[32:22.940 --> 32:23.720]  made it to my button.
[32:28.380 --> 32:28.900]  Switch.
[32:29.360 --> 32:30.260]  Got the key.
[32:30.420 --> 32:31.080]  Go up.
[32:34.820 --> 32:36.260]  Geoff, I like
[32:36.260 --> 32:37.880]  Geoff saying go up and then
[32:37.880 --> 32:39.580]  I feel like you're stationary.
[32:40.400 --> 32:41.000]  Keep going up.
[32:42.380 --> 32:43.740]  Alright, I got my button.
[32:46.460 --> 32:47.680]  We're so close.
[32:47.900 --> 32:50.260]  I'm so excited for the stats on this one.
[32:50.420 --> 32:52.480]  God, it's just 28 minutes till 5.
[32:53.280 --> 32:54.380]  28 minutes later.
[32:54.380 --> 32:55.420]  I got it.
[32:57.780 --> 32:58.300]  Nice!
[32:59.320 --> 33:00.240]  We did it.
[33:00.300 --> 33:02.960]  Just get out of here.
[33:03.480 --> 33:04.620]  Oh, there's a fan on that one?
[33:06.400 --> 33:08.360]  For Geoff to be killed.
[33:08.900 --> 33:09.160]  Yeah!
[33:10.580 --> 33:12.280]  That world was nothing.
[33:12.740 --> 33:13.800]  That was easy peasy.
[33:14.140 --> 33:14.840]  That was baby mode.
[33:16.480 --> 33:18.360]  Now, Gavin, are you more of a skills
[33:18.360 --> 33:19.220]  or devices guy?
[33:20.500 --> 33:22.400]  I'm a skills man.
[33:22.400 --> 33:22.860]  Go!
[33:24.160 --> 33:25.420]  Oh, we gotta do the last
[33:26.640 --> 33:27.280]  Wait, what?
[33:27.720 --> 33:29.680]  We gotta do the lowest count?
[33:31.400 --> 33:31.880]  Go!
[33:33.020 --> 33:33.540]  What the fuck?
[33:34.960 --> 33:36.740]  Uh, Geoff?
[33:37.020 --> 33:38.600]  Guys, what do you think Geoff is doing?
[33:38.980 --> 33:40.380]  I wasn't gonna get
[33:40.380 --> 33:41.080]  the lowest count.
[33:41.540 --> 33:43.300]  So what do we have to try and get?
[33:43.420 --> 33:45.420]  2 between us?
[33:46.420 --> 33:48.000]  Yeah, you have to be between
[33:48.000 --> 33:49.840]  .05 and 2 seconds.
[33:50.320 --> 33:50.760]  Oops.
[33:53.540 --> 33:54.360]  Sorry, sorry.
[33:54.460 --> 33:56.420]  I was trying to edge up on it.
[33:57.900 --> 33:58.880]  Oh, wait, not even.
[34:00.440 --> 34:01.720]  It seemed like we all did it.
[34:02.520 --> 34:03.360]  I thought so too.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.260]  Jump the gun.
[34:12.400 --> 34:12.840]  Shit.
[34:14.100 --> 34:15.280]  Was that you Gavin?
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.600]  It was not me, it was Gavin.
[34:18.140 --> 34:18.880]  Got it.
[34:19.140 --> 34:20.580]  I got .16.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.280]  Uh, Gavin was too fast.
[34:22.660 --> 34:23.300]  Oh, no you weren't.
[34:24.240 --> 34:24.440]  Yeah.
[34:29.460 --> 34:29.940]  Shit.
[34:33.700 --> 34:35.760]  Welcome to the rest of the stream.
[34:36.480 --> 34:37.620]  So this is Christmas.
[34:38.960 --> 34:39.740]  So we need to average
[34:39.740 --> 34:40.860]  under half a second each.
[34:41.240 --> 34:43.340]  Oh, Gavin.
[34:43.760 --> 34:45.580]  I hate this game.
[34:45.760 --> 34:47.720]  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
[34:48.320 --> 34:48.800]  Shit.
[34:52.380 --> 34:52.860]  Shit.
[34:55.900 --> 34:58.060]  I'm only going because I see Gavin go.
[34:58.600 --> 34:59.660]  Oh my god.
[35:00.020 --> 35:01.320]  Oh my god!
[35:02.940 --> 35:03.640]  Oh, that's that.
[35:03.740 --> 35:04.020]  You know what?
[35:05.100 --> 35:06.120]  First time for everything.
[35:07.700 --> 35:08.640]  Oh, close.
[35:09.240 --> 35:11.000]  Get right up on it.
[35:11.420 --> 35:11.980]  Well, not that close.
[35:15.100 --> 35:16.800]  Oh my god.
[35:16.800 --> 35:18.180]  It's impossible to tell
[35:18.180 --> 35:19.280]  when it's actually going to start.
[35:19.280 --> 35:20.920]  That's why I was trying to do it preemptively.
[35:22.400 --> 35:23.180]  Way to go, Nick.
[35:27.210 --> 35:27.930]  Alright, why don't we
[35:27.930 --> 35:28.830]  just count down?
[35:28.930 --> 35:30.990]  No, because it's not the same.
[35:31.230 --> 35:32.010]  It changes.
[35:33.050 --> 35:35.250]  Yeah, but at least we'll all be on the same time.
[35:35.730 --> 35:36.910]  That doesn't make any sense.
[35:37.150 --> 35:38.110]  What are we counting down to?
[35:38.810 --> 35:41.950]  No, because we might get it right by fluke.
[35:42.450 --> 35:43.990]  This is the craziest
[35:43.990 --> 35:45.430]  fucking guy in the world.
[35:49.530 --> 35:51.950]  Is there a pattern every other like...
[35:52.550 --> 35:53.710]  0.38, come on!
[35:53.730 --> 35:56.270]  That's got to be good enough. Come on, guys! I'm old and slow.
[35:56.570 --> 35:57.750]  Sorry, I'm just trying to...
[35:57.750 --> 35:59.690]  I'm trying to get right up on it.
[36:02.730 --> 36:03.130]  Damn.
[36:03.510 --> 36:04.970]  0.1 of a second off.
[36:09.110 --> 36:09.510]  Damn.
[36:09.510 --> 36:09.990]  Oh.
[36:12.630 --> 36:14.270]  Trying to get close.
[36:15.530 --> 36:16.090]  Damn it.
[36:17.050 --> 36:18.590]  Stop kicking me off!
[36:23.410 --> 36:25.450]  It's really making my anus clench.
[36:27.030 --> 36:29.830]  It's not the same. God, the time is so fucked.
[36:32.990 --> 36:33.670]  I...
[36:33.670 --> 36:35.230]  God damn it!
[36:35.590 --> 36:36.830]  You son of a bitch!
[36:42.760 --> 36:43.200]  Reflexes!
[36:43.200 --> 36:43.220]  Reflexes!
[36:43.540 --> 36:43.700]  Yes!
[36:43.980 --> 36:46.060]  Thank god.
[36:47.860 --> 36:49.040]  0.33, good job.
[36:49.200 --> 36:49.980]  Let me out of here.
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.140]  God, that was crazy.
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.900]  Oh man, we're going to have to do that again, probably.
[37:02.420 --> 37:03.220]  With bombs.
[37:04.660 --> 37:04.880]  Yeah.
[37:04.880 --> 37:04.940]  Yeah.
[37:08.780 --> 37:09.580]  Oh, jeez.
[37:11.080 --> 37:11.880]  Holy shit.
[37:12.880 --> 37:14.980]  Alright, let's collide midair and fall on the key.
[37:15.480 --> 37:16.780]  That's... yeah, that's...
[37:16.780 --> 37:17.540]  Ow, ow.
[37:18.080 --> 37:20.200]  You want me to push this thing?
[37:20.900 --> 37:21.620]  Yeah, hit me with the block.
[37:23.300 --> 37:23.700]  Ow.
[37:24.760 --> 37:25.300]  There we go.
[37:26.740 --> 37:27.960]  Where am I? Oh, I'm over here.
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.240]  Please stop pushing me.
[37:30.680 --> 37:33.800]  Everyone can collide with each other apart from the last person in the block, right?
[37:33.800 --> 37:34.340]  Yep.
[37:34.880 --> 37:36.040]  Ready, Geoff?
[37:36.780 --> 37:37.440]  Now.
[37:38.280 --> 37:38.960]  Close.
[37:40.220 --> 37:40.380]  Alright.
[37:43.250 --> 37:44.140]  Oh shit.
[37:44.640 --> 37:45.360]  Ready?
[37:46.080 --> 37:47.820]  Damn it.
[37:48.320 --> 37:49.780]  Can we climb and get the key?
[37:50.140 --> 37:50.680]  Somebody fall.
[37:53.730 --> 37:55.440]  Damn it.
[37:56.280 --> 37:56.580]  Tough.
[37:58.020 --> 37:59.140]  Ready?
[37:59.960 --> 38:01.480]  It's on your head.
[38:01.480 --> 38:03.600]  Yeah, I'm getting it off of him.
[38:03.700 --> 38:03.900]  Ready?
[38:04.740 --> 38:05.200]  Perfect.
[38:06.300 --> 38:06.760]  Nice.
[38:11.880 --> 38:13.140]  I'll help you.
[38:13.720 --> 38:14.240]  We'll just sink.
[38:14.460 --> 38:14.880]  Ready?
[38:16.680 --> 38:17.500]  3...
[38:19.260 --> 38:20.080]  2...
[38:20.080 --> 38:20.600]  1...
[38:20.600 --> 38:24.360]  We'll just sink.
[38:24.360 --> 38:24.860]  Whoop.
[38:27.480 --> 38:28.100]  Oh, really?
[38:31.360 --> 38:32.760]  Are we back on the button?
[38:37.420 --> 38:38.560]  Extra grow longer?
[38:38.900 --> 38:40.860]  Oh, dude, my hat looks crazy.
[38:41.700 --> 38:42.180]  There you go, Eric.
[38:42.500 --> 38:44.180]  How do I...
[38:44.180 --> 38:44.820]  Do you want to get on?
[38:45.420 --> 38:47.380]  Yeah, if you would stop, I could do it.
[38:47.940 --> 38:48.260]  Get on.
[38:49.680 --> 38:51.140]  What am I supposed to do here?
[38:51.140 --> 38:51.960]  Oh, shit.
[38:53.180 --> 38:54.220]  Do we have to get this ball?
[38:56.220 --> 38:58.180]  I like that the hats go up with it.
[38:58.420 --> 38:58.780]  Oh.
[39:01.160 --> 39:02.800]  So we'll have to, like, make it go down
[39:02.800 --> 39:04.120]  and then up again?
[39:06.120 --> 39:07.160]  You can probably hit it.
[39:07.160 --> 39:08.540]  Oh, so we should start low, then.
[39:08.620 --> 39:09.320]  We should start low.
[39:09.440 --> 39:12.360]  And have someone who's the longest at the end.
[39:12.800 --> 39:13.720]  And then medium.
[39:13.940 --> 39:15.180]  And so on and so forth.
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.980]  You should probably be lower, Andrew.
[39:18.980 --> 39:21.320]  Remember, you can jump hit it.
[39:21.600 --> 39:21.920]  Yep.
[39:25.560 --> 39:26.900]  Don't catch it in your ear holes.
[39:28.020 --> 39:28.120]  Oh.
[39:28.620 --> 39:31.540]  I was trying to see if I could jump it up.
[39:32.160 --> 39:32.540]  You can't.
[39:32.920 --> 39:34.060]  I think you just hit jump.
[39:34.480 --> 39:35.480]  Yeah, jump's the way to do it.
[39:37.100 --> 39:37.920]  That was good.
[39:38.360 --> 39:39.900]  Okay, we might need to spread out a little bit more.
[39:40.320 --> 39:41.060]  Let's get spread.
[39:43.500 --> 39:44.620]  Make sure you hit the jump.
[39:53.990 --> 39:54.390]  Sorry?
[40:02.890 --> 40:04.030]  Geoff, why do you never jump?
[40:05.190 --> 40:06.390]  I'm jumping every time!
[40:07.250 --> 40:08.070]  You don't see my character
[40:08.070 --> 40:08.890]  jumping in the air?
[40:09.550 --> 40:11.250]  No, we do not see your character jumping in the air.
[40:11.310 --> 40:12.590]  Why doesn't Green ever jump?
[40:13.850 --> 40:15.690]  Why would I need to jump? I'm locked in.
[40:15.950 --> 40:17.830]  I'm setting it up perfectly.
[40:18.090 --> 40:20.130]  If he was shorter, he could probably get
[40:20.130 --> 40:21.250]  some fucking height off of it.
[40:22.410 --> 40:23.330]  There's a wall.
[40:24.470 --> 40:24.970]  Yeah, but no.
[40:25.890 --> 40:28.110]  Gavin, you understand what I'm saying, right?
[40:29.050 --> 40:31.050]  Boy, if that doesn't sum this up.
[40:31.450 --> 40:31.730]  Okay, here.
[40:31.830 --> 40:33.730]  Yeah, but no.
[40:34.430 --> 40:35.430]  What am I going to do here?
[40:35.470 --> 40:37.090]  I've got like half a mile to get my ball.
[40:37.210 --> 40:37.730]  Oh, I see.
[40:38.550 --> 40:39.930]  Thank you, Christ.
[40:41.230 --> 40:42.810]  Yeah, right into the wall, yeah.
[40:43.590 --> 40:44.890]  Right, but it goes further still
[40:44.890 --> 40:45.730]  for you having shrunk.
[40:47.050 --> 40:49.390]  Okay, scoot over, scoot over.
[40:50.470 --> 40:51.590]  Was Eric right again?
[40:52.210 --> 40:53.950]  No, he was partially right.
[40:54.410 --> 40:55.130]  Oh, cool.
[40:55.930 --> 40:58.170]  No, no, he was only partially right.
[40:58.270 --> 40:59.470]  Okay. Right, partially right.
[40:59.870 --> 41:01.650]  Geoff was also partially right.
[41:01.870 --> 41:03.030]  Yeah, Geoff was definitely partially right.
[41:03.050 --> 41:05.530]  I've been making this over to you dunces the whole time.
[41:06.510 --> 41:07.330]  Oh, well.
[41:08.170 --> 41:09.630]  Reach Gavin for the first time.
[41:10.110 --> 41:11.270]  I panicked, didn't know what to do.
[41:14.150 --> 41:15.030]  What do you want from me?
[41:15.690 --> 41:17.090]  Maybe you need to get higher.
[41:17.810 --> 41:18.230]  There you go.
[41:19.910 --> 41:21.390]  Alright, get on my ear.
[41:21.390 --> 41:21.970]  Okay.
[41:23.290 --> 41:24.130]  Thank you.
[41:29.970 --> 41:30.590]  Go ahead.
[41:31.850 --> 41:32.430]  Go ahead.
[41:32.650 --> 41:33.670]  No, they did it!
[41:34.510 --> 41:35.270]  We are free.
[41:35.890 --> 41:37.270]  We are free.
[41:38.310 --> 41:40.770]  My ears are too long to open the door. What's going on?
[41:41.350 --> 41:42.070]  Get in the...
[41:42.730 --> 41:43.570]  This is great.
[41:45.910 --> 41:47.210]  Guys, thanks so much for watching.
[41:47.270 --> 41:48.330]  We're trying to take it to 501.
[41:48.330 --> 41:49.510]  We hope you appreciate it.
[41:49.510 --> 41:51.510]  We have a VOD coming out for this on Tuesday.
[41:52.450 --> 41:54.310]  Did you say we hope you appreciate it?
[41:54.630 --> 41:55.750]  Yeah, we hope you appreciate this.
[41:56.350 --> 41:56.570]  Oh.
[41:57.990 --> 41:59.970]  Do you not hope that it's appreciated?
[42:00.290 --> 42:01.810]  I was appreciating them for watching.
[42:03.170 --> 42:03.870]  Yeah, what are you hoping for?
[42:03.870 --> 42:05.970]  I just hope it's appreciated.
[42:06.130 --> 42:07.030]  I appreciate it.
[42:07.150 --> 42:09.390]  What the hell?
[42:09.390 --> 42:11.290]  Jill turns you upside down.
[42:11.950 --> 42:12.390]  Oh.
[42:13.870 --> 42:15.230]  10-4 is piss, right?
[42:16.630 --> 42:17.230]  10-4?
[42:17.650 --> 42:18.590]  No, 10-1 is piss.
[42:18.790 --> 42:20.510]  10-1 is piss, 10-4 is like, okay?
[42:21.050 --> 42:21.230]  Yeah.
[42:22.130 --> 42:24.710]  Oh, what the fuck?
[42:24.910 --> 42:27.790]  We have to make a little stack and then flip on the end of the stack.
[42:28.590 --> 42:30.990]  Oh, so we're gonna have to...
[42:34.670 --> 42:37.170]  Could you double so you end up jumping?
[42:39.230 --> 42:40.290]  No, you only do it once.
[42:40.470 --> 42:42.530]  So we're gonna have to stack on...
[42:42.530 --> 42:43.970]  Gang off the ceiling.
[42:44.150 --> 42:44.890]  On me.
[42:45.590 --> 42:46.950]  There you go.
[42:48.030 --> 42:48.230]  Okay.
[42:49.610 --> 42:52.990]  And then you would stack there and then forward and then stack.
[42:53.090 --> 42:55.150]  And then Nick would be able to make the transfer.
[42:55.270 --> 42:55.790]  Please stop moving.
[42:56.030 --> 42:56.430]  Oh my god.
[42:58.130 --> 42:59.550]  Nick, you hit the button.
[43:00.670 --> 43:02.110]  He's not gonna be close enough.
[43:02.470 --> 43:02.910]  Yeah, he will.
[43:03.090 --> 43:07.390]  Well, let me tell you, I tried to jump after...
[43:07.390 --> 43:08.850]  Yeah, I don't think you're close enough.
[43:09.470 --> 43:09.730]  No.
[43:09.730 --> 43:11.290]  Nah, you're close enough.
[43:11.510 --> 43:14.150]  Maybe we just need to get further spread.
[43:14.710 --> 43:15.290]  Gavin, thoughts?
[43:15.510 --> 43:17.770]  I don't know how much more spread we can do.
[43:18.350 --> 43:19.990]  Yeah, I think we can do a little bit more.
[43:20.150 --> 43:20.570]  That was really spread.
[43:20.570 --> 43:22.110]  I think we can do a little more.
[43:24.630 --> 43:25.410]  Gavin, thoughts?
[43:28.490 --> 43:29.530]  Missed the old jump there.
[43:30.170 --> 43:31.390]  This is Gavin's kryptonite.
[43:31.590 --> 43:32.010]  This level.
[43:37.080 --> 43:37.800]  Oh, sorry.
[43:37.800 --> 43:38.640]  Oh, sorry.
[43:40.420 --> 43:41.060]  Locked in.
[43:43.620 --> 43:45.740]  If you jump under someone's...
[43:45.740 --> 43:48.320]  What happens if you jump under someone?
[43:48.380 --> 43:49.060]  Does it lift them?
[43:49.700 --> 43:50.300]  To the other floor?
[43:51.100 --> 43:52.140]  I don't know.
[43:52.580 --> 43:54.640]  What if Nick jumps now?
[43:56.100 --> 43:56.540]  Nothing.
[44:01.600 --> 44:02.760]  Everybody line up.
[44:03.060 --> 44:04.960]  Geoff, you go as far to the right as you can.
[44:06.640 --> 44:07.680]  Boy, I can't tell.
[44:07.680 --> 44:08.400]  Shit.
[44:09.460 --> 44:11.160]  Wait, wait, wait.
[44:12.140 --> 44:13.320]  We can start it over.
[44:13.740 --> 44:14.540]  Gavin, go left.
[44:15.920 --> 44:16.500]  Gavin, go left.
[44:16.920 --> 44:18.180]  There you go.
[44:19.720 --> 44:20.960]  I'll just be on the bottom now.
[44:21.120 --> 44:21.860]  Oh my god.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.380]  Make room for other people to do it.
[44:26.320 --> 44:27.680]  I think I've already made enough room.
[44:28.060 --> 44:29.580]  I disagree, but that's fine.
[44:30.300 --> 44:30.880]  Alright, hold on.
[44:31.580 --> 44:33.080]  Alright, one more time, boys.
[44:33.540 --> 44:34.200]  That's okay.
[44:34.200 --> 44:35.660]  No, you guys...
[44:36.200 --> 44:36.980]  There we go.
[44:38.520 --> 44:38.880]  Perfect.
[44:39.360 --> 44:40.020]  Hold on, hold on.
[44:42.060 --> 44:44.880]  God, you have to be pixel perfect.
[44:46.880 --> 44:47.840]  I don't know that I can...
[44:47.840 --> 44:48.840]  Gavin, you have to go more to the right.
[44:49.020 --> 44:50.540]  Just jump and try, man.
[44:51.480 --> 44:53.780]  If you even hit the jump, you just drop.
[44:53.800 --> 44:55.220]  I think Geoff needs to move.
[44:56.060 --> 44:58.000]  I think Geoff needs to go a little bit more right.
[44:58.140 --> 44:59.220]  I think Gavin needs to also.
[45:00.640 --> 45:01.000]  Use...
[45:01.000 --> 45:01.900]  There we go.
[45:02.680 --> 45:04.920]  Do you think if Gavin goes a little more right, we're still there?
[45:05.360 --> 45:06.240]  Yeah, I think so.
[45:06.280 --> 45:07.020]  I think we're fine now.
[45:09.200 --> 45:09.920]  Hang on.
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.340]  Should I do it now?
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.260]  I think you should do it now.
[45:14.660 --> 45:14.740]  Okay.
[45:18.260 --> 45:18.980]  What happened?
[45:19.040 --> 45:19.660]  What did that do?
[45:20.560 --> 45:21.620]  Come on out, boys.
[45:24.040 --> 45:24.760]  Lovely stuff.
[45:25.300 --> 45:26.800]  Now, before we start hitting buttons...
[45:26.800 --> 45:27.060]  Hang on.
[45:31.420 --> 45:32.220]  I think...
[45:32.820 --> 45:35.460]  I think four people need to get on this thing.
[45:35.560 --> 45:37.780]  One person needs to drop to the bottom.
[45:38.260 --> 45:39.860]  And then it's going to come back.
[45:39.960 --> 45:41.620]  I have a feeling it's going to go left and right.
[45:42.860 --> 45:43.660]  And then...
[45:43.660 --> 45:45.020]  Yeah, I think that's what's going to happen.
[45:45.220 --> 45:46.880]  So, Andrew, do you want to stay up here?
[45:47.620 --> 45:47.960]  Sure.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.380]  Let's see what happens.
[45:52.560 --> 45:53.360]  Three, four...
[45:53.360 --> 45:53.600]  Ready?
[45:54.280 --> 45:56.500]  But then it's going to stop when you go down.
[45:56.600 --> 45:57.320]  Oh, no one's going down.
[45:57.320 --> 45:57.720]  Oh.
[45:58.280 --> 45:58.720]  Oh.
[46:01.340 --> 46:02.120]  Maybe not.
[46:02.360 --> 46:03.960]  I don't think it's going to go far enough to the left.
[46:04.040 --> 46:05.980]  I think we have to do five and one person gets off.
[46:06.360 --> 46:06.600]  Whoops.
[46:06.840 --> 46:11.980]  He loves to jump as soon as it starts.
[46:12.040 --> 46:14.780]  We are going to fucking run this to 501.
[46:14.880 --> 46:15.460]  This level.
[46:16.740 --> 46:16.980]  Oh.
[46:17.220 --> 46:18.620]  There's no way.
[46:26.310 --> 46:27.190]  Wait until...
[46:27.190 --> 46:27.690]  There you go.
[46:27.690 --> 46:28.670]  Thanks, man.
[46:31.590 --> 46:33.630]  It's really hard to tell with Andrew's hat.
[46:33.850 --> 46:34.150]  Yeah.
[46:37.110 --> 46:38.110]  Disadvantage for sure.
[46:38.890 --> 46:42.170]  Geoff needs to take a ball of care to the right.
[46:43.230 --> 46:43.950]  There we go.
[46:44.750 --> 46:45.790]  Do you think that's far enough?
[46:46.230 --> 46:47.750]  Yeah, I think you're good.
[46:47.750 --> 46:47.870]  Oh.
[46:49.950 --> 46:52.730]  I was standing on nothing and I shot up to nothing.
[46:52.890 --> 46:53.410]  It's pretty special.
[46:54.170 --> 46:54.630]  Okay.
[46:55.570 --> 46:55.970]  So...
[46:56.690 --> 46:57.490]  Hang on.
[46:58.270 --> 46:59.490]  I can drop off.
[47:01.850 --> 47:04.850]  I think we all have to be on the platform for it to move.
[47:04.850 --> 47:06.650]  I think all five of us get on it.
[47:07.050 --> 47:09.510]  And then we drop one down on the red.
[47:09.670 --> 47:09.970]  Yeah.
[47:10.530 --> 47:12.410]  I'll drop down because I'm on the end.
[47:12.690 --> 47:14.350]  Hang on. We're all going to drop at the same time.
[47:14.430 --> 47:14.530]  Ready?
[47:15.790 --> 47:16.730]  Andrew's dropping, not me?
[47:17.810 --> 47:20.310]  I'm dropping to hit the button because I'm on the end.
[47:20.870 --> 47:21.090]  Okay.
[47:21.090 --> 47:24.990]  The four of us at the top are going to hit A at the same time.
[47:25.010 --> 47:25.150]  Ready?
[47:25.910 --> 47:27.770]  3, 2, 1, go.
[47:28.250 --> 47:28.930]  There we go.
[47:29.090 --> 47:31.030]  Andrew, you got it.
[47:31.470 --> 47:32.790]  Nice. Hop up!
[47:34.650 --> 47:34.950]  Oh!
[47:37.550 --> 47:38.350]  I see.
[47:39.410 --> 47:40.010]  No, no, no.
[47:41.190 --> 47:42.550]  Can we make this jump?
[47:43.830 --> 47:44.350]  Into the ceiling?
[47:44.590 --> 47:44.690]  No.
[47:45.450 --> 47:50.070]  What has to happen is one person has to get off at the end
[47:50.070 --> 47:51.610]  before you hit the
[47:52.250 --> 47:53.050]  red spikes.
[47:53.290 --> 47:55.510]  And then I think the person that hit the switch
[47:55.510 --> 47:57.410]  when the platform comes back
[47:57.410 --> 47:58.890]  has to get on the underneath part.
[48:00.230 --> 48:01.130]  Isn't that what we said?
[48:03.370 --> 48:04.010]  I don't know.
[48:04.110 --> 48:06.490]  Yeah, the first time when we didn't know about the spikes or anything.
[48:06.610 --> 48:06.810]  Yes.
[48:12.710 --> 48:14.330]  Oh, I'm so on the edge.
[48:16.070 --> 48:17.050]  Okay, I think that's good.
[48:17.050 --> 48:17.270]  Alright.
[48:18.950 --> 48:19.790]  Oh, yeah.
[48:19.870 --> 48:20.530]  You're good.
[48:23.850 --> 48:25.150]  Can we make
[48:25.150 --> 48:25.970]  this jump?
[48:31.010 --> 48:32.050]  Okay, so...
[48:33.070 --> 48:34.910]  Hang on, how are we going to do this?
[48:37.510 --> 48:38.910]  Because we have to remain
[48:38.910 --> 48:41.130]  four on here. So I'm going to drop
[48:41.130 --> 48:43.210]  down here on this
[48:43.210 --> 48:43.510]  thing.
[48:44.610 --> 48:45.450]  Then our
[48:45.450 --> 48:47.790]  next move is to have
[48:49.050 --> 48:49.490]  Nick
[48:49.490 --> 48:51.170]  is going to go down and hit the switch.
[48:51.310 --> 48:53.550]  You two are going to drop from the top at the same time.
[48:53.930 --> 48:54.090]  Yep.
[48:54.450 --> 48:57.090]  Nick is going to walk off to the left and hit the switch.
[48:57.230 --> 48:57.630]  Yep.
[48:57.830 --> 49:01.490]  When we get close to the end
[49:01.490 --> 49:03.490]  here, one of us has to go
[49:03.490 --> 49:04.930]  to the top so that way
[49:04.930 --> 49:06.770]  this platform can come back.
[49:07.550 --> 49:08.430]  The floor
[49:09.230 --> 49:10.730]  extends once you hit the button.
[49:10.730 --> 49:12.130]  So they can just walk across.
[49:12.370 --> 49:14.530]  So the four of us on the platform
[49:14.530 --> 49:16.210]  just need to go to the roof once we pass.
[49:17.030 --> 49:18.710]  Everybody jumps off at the
[49:18.710 --> 49:19.210]  wrong time.
[49:20.150 --> 49:21.610]  Maybe not jump though.
[49:22.390 --> 49:24.550]  Nick, do you want to do a countdown and then I'll hit A with you?
[49:24.890 --> 49:26.350]  If you want to get on the ceiling, you have to jump.
[49:26.790 --> 49:26.850]  Yeah.
[49:27.610 --> 49:30.490]  3, 2, 1, go.
[49:30.790 --> 49:31.870]  Nick, you got it.
[49:32.450 --> 49:33.630]  Wait, Geoff, wait, Geoff, wait.
[49:34.130 --> 49:34.390]  Now!
[49:40.560 --> 49:41.440]  I hit jump.
[49:41.440 --> 49:43.720]  It didn't look like it.
[49:46.960 --> 49:49.280]  We got it all figured out.
[49:49.600 --> 49:50.360]  We got this.
[49:50.760 --> 49:52.680]  I don't think I've done that enough times to be pulling at me.
[49:55.560 --> 49:57.640]  Yeah, I really
[49:57.640 --> 49:59.120]  think it's pulling at you, bud.
[50:02.980 --> 50:03.380]  Sorry.
[50:04.780 --> 50:06.380]  Hang on, Andrew just needs to go.
[50:09.220 --> 50:09.880]  I tried.
[50:10.420 --> 50:10.880]  You're good.
[50:11.080 --> 50:12.580]  I was trying to make it so we'd do less.
[50:12.820 --> 50:13.800]  Yeah, no, I hear you.
[50:14.040 --> 50:15.580]  You did the right thing, I just wasn't over enough.
[50:16.140 --> 50:16.420]  Yeah.
[50:18.040 --> 50:18.940]  Oh, shit!
[50:20.460 --> 50:20.860]  What?
[50:21.400 --> 50:23.400]  This looked like Eric fell before he jumped.
[50:23.980 --> 50:24.300]  Nope.
[50:26.600 --> 50:26.980]  Netcode.
[50:28.680 --> 50:29.080]  Netcode.
[50:29.160 --> 50:31.500]  Alright, tease the tips.
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.860]  Why are we so...
[50:34.860 --> 50:36.240]  Should I go a little more right?
[50:37.200 --> 50:37.960]  That's enough.
[50:38.140 --> 50:38.800]  Yeah, that's enough.
[50:43.980 --> 50:46.220]  Okay, I'm gonna go down and
[50:46.220 --> 50:47.360]  hit the switch this time.
[50:48.240 --> 50:48.540]  Okay.
[50:50.960 --> 50:51.520]  Okay.
[50:52.380 --> 50:52.940]  Ready?
[50:54.620 --> 50:56.380]  3, 2, 1,
[50:56.640 --> 50:56.920]  go!
[51:01.660 --> 51:02.860]  Nice, good work, boys.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.020]  Now level off.
[51:05.160 --> 51:05.580]  There you go.
[51:06.280 --> 51:06.760]  Okay.
[51:07.480 --> 51:08.380]  Should I get this?
[51:09.100 --> 51:11.100]  Okay, and then everyone else can come down.
[51:11.340 --> 51:11.680]  That's it.
[51:12.720 --> 51:13.680]  Good work.
[51:14.060 --> 51:15.920]  Good job, fellas.
[51:17.580 --> 51:18.900]  We just had to see it through.
[51:19.220 --> 51:19.360]  Simple.
[51:20.780 --> 51:23.040]  Look at that! Skills or devices?
[51:23.220 --> 51:25.540]  Skills or devices done.
[51:26.100 --> 51:27.480]  And we didn't have to do the timer twice.
[51:28.360 --> 51:30.100]  Blowing through this thing today.
[51:31.120 --> 51:32.080]  Parkville Dodger.
[51:33.060 --> 51:33.700]  Alright, we're
[51:33.700 --> 51:35.180]  10 minutes till 5-0-1, boys.
[51:35.320 --> 51:36.220]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.620]  I hit the wall.
[51:39.740 --> 51:40.440]  I hit the wall, I'm sorry.
[51:40.980 --> 51:43.960]  I didn't realize that, uh...
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.180]  What the fuck was going on?
[51:45.480 --> 51:46.140]  We're just dodging.
[51:46.600 --> 51:46.920]  Yep.
[51:49.420 --> 51:50.540]  Gavin, get out of my fucking way.
[51:50.960 --> 51:51.760]  I'm trying to get away from you.
[51:54.000 --> 51:54.840]  Oh my god.
[51:55.240 --> 51:55.560]  Easy.
[51:56.580 --> 51:59.620]  Gavin's trying to block it so that way I get hit by the ball like it's my fault.
[51:59.800 --> 52:00.900]  It's not, it's Gavin's fault.
[52:00.900 --> 52:02.280]  Weren't we just doing...
[52:02.280 --> 52:04.680]  Weren't you and Andrew and I just doing this with something?
[52:06.140 --> 52:06.940]  Uh, were we?
[52:07.100 --> 52:07.840]  What's blue?
[52:07.860 --> 52:08.680]  The eagle.
[52:13.600 --> 52:14.200]  Feathers.
[52:14.720 --> 52:15.240]  Oh god.
[52:15.800 --> 52:18.840]  Whoa! Bad timing for all those subs!
[52:18.920 --> 52:19.760]  Oh my god!
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.400]  Who did it?
[52:22.900 --> 52:24.020]  Ulta Becca Prime?
[52:24.480 --> 52:25.160]  Oh my god!
[52:26.420 --> 52:27.320]  Thank you so much!
[52:27.320 --> 52:29.680]  Ulta Becca Prime with the 20 gifted subs!
[52:30.080 --> 52:31.040]  Holy shit!
[52:31.880 --> 52:34.480]  It took my attention away for half a second.
[52:34.640 --> 52:36.260]  I went, I fucking blew it.
[52:36.460 --> 52:36.940]  Oh my god.
[52:37.100 --> 52:39.820]  That tried to murder us with kindness.
[52:39.820 --> 52:40.760]  It almost worked.
[52:41.200 --> 52:43.340]  Ulta Becca Prime, thank you so much.
[52:43.600 --> 52:45.320]  That was a kindness kill.
[52:45.760 --> 52:46.260]  Yeah, big time.
[52:46.480 --> 52:48.220]  I can only be distracted by money so much.
[52:48.240 --> 52:49.460]  I was getting a soda, I'm sorry!
[52:51.120 --> 52:52.280]  You were what?
[52:52.520 --> 52:54.440]  I was getting a soda, I'm sorry!
[52:54.440 --> 52:56.000]  You were doing what?
[52:56.460 --> 52:57.320]  I was getting a soda.
[52:58.820 --> 52:59.800]  And the level started.
[53:00.120 --> 53:00.860]  Goddammit, move!
[53:02.980 --> 53:04.580]  Andrew was in my way, I couldn't go any further.
[53:04.600 --> 53:06.180]  Sorry about that, I didn't know anyone needed space.
[53:06.320 --> 53:07.340]  I was just locked in on what I needed.
[53:08.660 --> 53:10.400]  Give everyone all the space in the world.
[53:10.520 --> 53:11.280]  Get down!
[53:11.720 --> 53:13.660]  If you're at the top, go all the way to the top.
[53:13.800 --> 53:15.220]  If you're at the bottom, go all the way to the bottom.
[53:16.160 --> 53:17.080]  Okay, going to the bottom.
[53:18.340 --> 53:18.620]  Alright.
[53:20.660 --> 53:21.540]  Gavin, me and you.
[53:21.540 --> 53:22.820]  Bad news.
[53:24.400 --> 53:25.540]  Rock, hard place.
[53:29.240 --> 53:32.980]  Alright, split the diff.
[53:34.140 --> 53:34.620]  There we go.
[53:35.040 --> 53:36.460]  Geoff, you're going to grab that and come up.
[53:37.760 --> 53:38.340]  Go down?
[53:38.860 --> 53:40.980]  Nice, there you go. Way to go, man.
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.000]  Good work.
[53:43.160 --> 53:44.500]  Drink all the soda you want after this one.
[53:45.800 --> 53:46.420]  Oh no!
[53:46.760 --> 53:47.900]  Go up, go up, go up!
[53:47.900 --> 53:48.440]  Go up, go up, go up!
[53:48.660 --> 53:50.100]  Geoff, go down!
[53:51.860 --> 53:52.940]  Why did you...
[53:53.540 --> 53:55.040]  The gap was at the top.
[53:55.260 --> 53:56.980]  Geoff, throw your soda away now.
[53:57.820 --> 53:58.380]  Throw it away, dude.
[54:01.020 --> 54:01.820]  Spread out.
[54:02.920 --> 54:04.380]  What are you doing?
[54:04.980 --> 54:05.720]  Way to go, Nick!
[54:06.980 --> 54:07.800]  Way to go, Nick!
[54:09.060 --> 54:10.020]  One time.
[54:10.440 --> 54:11.400]  One time.
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.480]  You're dead.
[54:13.800 --> 54:14.860]  Way to go, Geoff.
[54:14.860 --> 54:15.480]  And Andrew!
[54:16.700 --> 54:17.680]  I thought I had room.
[54:18.180 --> 54:21.780]  Going all the way to the bottom.
[54:26.150 --> 54:27.350]  Alright, Andrew, you can grab that.
[54:27.730 --> 54:28.670]  Grab it and come up.
[54:29.150 --> 54:29.610]  Go down.
[54:31.630 --> 54:32.290]  Down with you.
[54:34.150 --> 54:34.630]  Okay.
[54:36.350 --> 54:37.230]  Everyone down.
[54:38.750 --> 54:39.490]  Going all the way up.
[54:39.790 --> 54:41.510]  Oh boy.
[54:42.610 --> 54:43.410]  I'm sorry.
[54:43.410 --> 54:44.970]  I'm sorry. That was on me.
[54:45.690 --> 54:46.550]  Sorry about that.
[54:47.870 --> 54:48.870]  Is that a bit?
[54:49.530 --> 54:50.510]  No, I just missed.
[54:51.530 --> 54:51.930]  Move!
[54:52.570 --> 54:53.990]  Was that a bit, Gavin?
[54:54.790 --> 54:57.090]  I couldn't go down, you fool! Where was I going to go?
[54:57.890 --> 54:59.610]  It's okay, Nick wasn't paying attention
[54:59.610 --> 55:00.350]  and then went, ah!
[55:00.790 --> 55:01.390]  So it's okay.
[55:03.730 --> 55:04.870]  I thought I had room.
[55:08.070 --> 55:09.170]  This is the game title
[55:09.170 --> 55:09.970]  that's going to make me poo.
[55:09.970 --> 55:11.970]  Go up!
[55:13.390 --> 55:14.310]  The gap's at the top!
[55:14.950 --> 55:15.710]  Andrew, you got that?
[55:15.950 --> 55:16.670]  Go down!
[55:18.510 --> 55:19.730]  Andrew's doing a bit.
[55:20.070 --> 55:20.770]  We're good.
[55:22.090 --> 55:22.930]  We're fine.
[55:24.010 --> 55:25.310]  I'm the one doing the bit, huh?
[55:26.470 --> 55:26.910]  My bit?
[55:27.470 --> 55:29.390]  You can't make me laugh.
[55:33.790 --> 55:36.150]  I think Nick was paying attention.
[55:36.310 --> 55:36.930]  That's what I can tell.
[55:38.150 --> 55:39.530]  Eric got us killed.
[55:39.770 --> 55:40.370]  I'm going to die.
[55:40.790 --> 55:42.130]  I can't get down far.
[55:42.950 --> 55:43.910]  That's not my fault.
[55:44.910 --> 55:45.970]  That's not my fault.
[55:48.910 --> 55:50.170]  It's falling apart.
[55:54.390 --> 55:56.090]  You guys remember when Gavin farted
[55:56.090 --> 55:57.750]  every five minutes this morning?
[55:58.110 --> 55:58.530]  I missed.
[56:00.350 --> 56:02.070]  You didn't even get the key!
[56:02.290 --> 56:03.450]  I was trying to kiss the key.
[56:09.080 --> 56:10.180]  There you go, Gavin!
[56:11.420 --> 56:13.820]  Boys! We're taking it to 5-0-1!
[56:14.660 --> 56:15.460]  I'm losing it.
[56:15.920 --> 56:17.160]  Unfortunately, we are.
[56:19.820 --> 56:20.220]  Gavin?
[56:20.340 --> 56:21.020]  Gavin, down!
[56:23.320 --> 56:24.860]  You had to go up, Geoff!
[56:24.940 --> 56:26.020]  The gap was at the top!
[56:30.520 --> 56:31.780]  What about that one?
[56:32.740 --> 56:34.100]  Gavin, what were you doing?
[56:34.220 --> 56:35.540]  The gap was at the bottom, that was my bad.
[56:46.990 --> 56:47.510]  Oh!
[56:54.870 --> 56:56.730]  I can't believe you lived through that.
[56:58.430 --> 56:59.270]  Please go down.
[57:04.440 --> 57:05.580]  The gap's at the bottom.
[57:05.940 --> 57:10.060]  Oh boy. Tough one.
[57:11.400 --> 57:11.760]  There you go.
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.800]  Alright, moving on up!
[57:16.020 --> 57:16.520]  Got the key!
[57:18.200 --> 57:20.380]  Taking it to 5-0-1,
[57:20.380 --> 57:21.280]  ladies and gentlemen!
[57:32.300 --> 57:34.140]  You could have killed me there very easily.
[57:34.360 --> 57:34.480]  Kill him!
[57:35.080 --> 57:35.900]  Down, down, down!
[57:37.700 --> 57:39.020]  Alright, here we go.
[57:41.000 --> 57:41.960]  All the way, boys!
[57:42.440 --> 57:43.080]  Way to go, Gavin!
[57:45.320 --> 57:46.440]  I panicked at the end.
[57:47.380 --> 57:49.520]  Yeah, it's pretty easy to panic at the end, isn't it?
[57:49.520 --> 57:50.380]  I'm right there with you, buddy.
[57:52.820 --> 57:56.040]  You could just watch them wave in and out.
[57:57.300 --> 57:58.440]  Please go down.
[58:01.180 --> 58:01.820]  Okay.
[58:03.860 --> 58:04.500]  Easy.
[58:04.780 --> 58:05.440]  Oh, I'm sorry, everyone coming down.
[58:06.760 --> 58:08.540]  Everyone up, everyone up!
[58:11.500 --> 58:13.460]  Yes, son!
[58:18.990 --> 58:19.430]  Go!
[58:19.810 --> 58:21.310]  Get out of this hellscape!
[58:24.570 --> 58:25.370]  Hell yeah!
[58:26.470 --> 58:27.770]  Easy, baby stuff.
[58:28.030 --> 58:31.190]  We doing more dodging?
[58:33.950 --> 58:34.350]  Yeah!
[58:35.470 --> 58:36.510]  I like this.
[58:40.950 --> 58:43.290]  Do you think one color's good and one color's bad?
[58:43.370 --> 58:44.710]  Yeah, can I get hit by a Toadstool?
[58:45.110 --> 58:46.990]  I don't think so. I think they're all bad.
[58:47.010 --> 58:47.430]  Oh, God.
[58:48.170 --> 58:49.390]  I can eat all the red ones.
[58:50.470 --> 58:51.410]  Can I eat the blue?
[58:52.070 --> 58:53.090]  I'll take the blue raspberry.
[58:54.470 --> 58:55.130]  Oh, God!
[58:55.430 --> 58:55.810]  I got them all!
[59:01.610 --> 59:02.930]  Where does it want me to...
[59:03.550 --> 59:04.210]  Sorry about that.
[59:04.290 --> 59:05.010]  Someone's getting hit.
[59:06.230 --> 59:06.810]  That was me.
[59:08.410 --> 59:09.710]  Can you take a hit?
[59:10.570 --> 59:11.790]  Yeah, you can.
[59:11.810 --> 59:13.850]  You can take two and then you die on the third.
[59:15.070 --> 59:16.350]  Is it group health?
[59:16.350 --> 59:17.610]  It is group health, yes.
[59:18.150 --> 59:21.470]  Well, just don't get hit again.
[59:22.930 --> 59:23.430]  I won't.
[59:26.430 --> 59:27.550]  Oh, and you put it that way.
[59:28.230 --> 59:28.810]  Pretty easy.
[59:31.210 --> 59:34.430]  Like, there's way more white than blue and red, so stay in the white.
[59:35.670 --> 59:36.170]  Someone got hit.
[59:37.990 --> 59:39.330]  Alright, we're gonna have to start moving now.
[59:39.570 --> 59:41.290]  Oh, I think you and I are locked in here, Geoff.
[59:41.610 --> 59:44.590]  Gavin is doing his best to stay right on top of me.
[59:45.350 --> 59:46.390]  You're in front of me.
[59:47.110 --> 59:52.110]  I don't know why you came directly over to me and touched me the entire time.
[59:52.150 --> 59:54.990]  I don't know what is wrong with you, but something is wrong with you.
[59:55.950 --> 59:57.590]  Just get away from me.
[59:57.710 --> 59:58.910]  Just get away from me.
[59:58.910 --> 59:59.650]  We're almost done.
[01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:05.650]  Let me tell you that as someone who has to stay with Geoff for that whole thing, there is not a lot of choice.
[01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:06.650]  Good job.
[01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:09.610]  Andrew, you did a great job.
[01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:10.530]  Thank you, guys, so much.
[01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:11.530]  Thanks for being here.
[01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:12.590]  You did a great job.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.350]  You did a great job, too. And so did Gavin.
[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:16.970]  I don't know about that.
[01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.890]  That was like being in a revolving door.
[01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:21.150]  This is it, Parkville Dodger, guys.
[01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.890]  This is gonna do it, our last level.
[01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.350]  As we take it to 5.01 PM.
[01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.670]  We might have to go to 5.02 depending on how long...
[01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:29.890]  I'm playing Marvel Rivals, baby.
[01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.350]  I played a little Marvel Rivals yesterday. It's cool.
[01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.190]  It's fun. It's fun as hell.
[01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:36.730]  Still no Call of Duty, but...
[01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:37.950]  No, no, definitely not.
[01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.530]  But I can play as the Raccoon.
[01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:40.250]  I enjoy it.
[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:42.550]  Oh, here we go.
[01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.270]  Hey, watch out for the second round.
[01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.050]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.850]  Alright, you and you right here.
[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.510]  We're kissing. We're boys and we're kissing.
[01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:52.310]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:54.810]  Oh god, oh god, oh god. Go left!
[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:55.310]  Gavin!
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.790]  Oh god, go left, go left, go left.
[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:02.890]  Go left, go left, go left.
[01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:03.990]  There's too many of us.
[01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:06.230]  Ow!
[01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:08.470]  Go, go right, go right.
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:09.750]  You're too far, you're too far.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.950]  Oh god.
[01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:12.890]  Gavin!
[01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.450]  I'm doing so amazingly on this level.
[01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:17.610]  Can we stand on each other?
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:18.850]  Oh, we can stand on each other.
[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:22.090]  Hey, Gavin, Gavin did it. Way to go.
[01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.170]  Yeah, we definitely
[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.510]  can't call that a Gavin.
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.950]  Yeah, and then also,
[01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.210]  the question was who's fucking them up
[01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.090]  the most, and Gavin is the winner.
[01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:33.890]  I don't think I've been hit yet.
[01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.530]  I don't know if you can, it looks like
[01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.790]  in between rounds, you cannot be on top of each other.
[01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:38.770]  Jeez, that's tough.
[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.750]  I was just trying to jump on the floor.
[01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:41.870]  It's okay.
[01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.390]  Uh...
[01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.910]  I don't like the nomenclache.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.040]  Ooh.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:52.600]  Okay.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:54.400]  I'm gonna get over here with you, Geoff.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.460]  Well, that's Andrew.
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.920]  Oh, that is Andrew.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.020]  Go that way, go that way.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.200]  Go that way, go that way.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:02.380]  You idiot.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.820]  Oh, God.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:06.480]  Move.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.480]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.740]  Nice.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.240]  Oh, God.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.480]  Over there.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:15.840]  Oh, stack.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.220]  Good stack.
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.560]  Do it again, Andrew, me and you.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.320]  Stack me and you, Gavin.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.200]  Stack.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.500]  Oh, boys, that was it.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.000]  No!
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.420]  No!
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.000]  Gavin zigged when he should have zagged.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.440]  That happens.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.140]  It happens to the best of them.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:37.960]  What about the worst?
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.640]  The worst of them.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:40.980]  Somebody got hit.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.800]  It was not I.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.860]  I mean, that was just an insane move
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.480]  by you, Gavin.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.440]  All right, we got time.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.100]  We got space.
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:53.920]  We got time, we got space.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.240]  This next one, I think people are going to have to stack.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.640]  Yep. Gavin, get on.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.380]  Stacked and ready.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.640]  You don't have to there, Geoff, but I'm fine with it.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:03.820]  Don't bother me, none.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.340]  Now, I will say, that bothered me.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.260]  I can see how that would.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.480]  I thought you'd go left, but you didn't.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.120]  I just hope on the stats
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.980]  it does not show that as my death
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.960]  because it definitely wasn't.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.160]  Why are you trying to kill me?
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.460]  Nice dodge, Geoff.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.680]  Go left.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:20.680]  Dip shit.
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.000]  In the previous round, though, you were
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.620]  a bit stingy with the space.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.060]  Nice, good work, boys.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:39.420]  Me and you, Gavin. We got this.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.560]  All right, Andrew, big time.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:41.360]  Yep.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.680]  Oh, boy, that was close. Me and you again.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.200]  The only way we can go from here is right, so
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.280]  I'll move us.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.240]  Nice!
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.880]  Yes, good work. Guys!
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.200]  We did it! Pico, Park,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.320]  Gavin, and Eric forever. We did it.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.340]  That's it. That's how you
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.380]  do it. Pico Part 2 is a baby
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.300]  game for babies. We're the
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.020]  kings, the Parkful Dodgers.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:04.820]  Woo!
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.140]  How many more levels do we got?
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.760]  Another world first.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.060]  Four more.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.580]  We can beat it again next time?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.720]  And we have the dark levels after this.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.100]  And then there's
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.560]  an infinity mode at some point, too.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.160]  Well, guys, we did it. Thank you so much
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.940]  for watching. It's been Pico Park 2.

[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.860]  Who can say? Either way, you can
