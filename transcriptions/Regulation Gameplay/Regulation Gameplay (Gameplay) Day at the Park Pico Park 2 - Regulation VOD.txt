[00:00.000 --> 00:00.720]  Andrew, thoughts?
[00:01.980 --> 00:04.140]  Uh, my thoughts are let's play Pika Part 2.
[00:04.340 --> 00:05.720]  I don't, I don't care about this.
[00:05.720 --> 00:07.720]  I'm just waiting for us an amount of piss rats.
[00:07.940 --> 00:09.820]  That means we're like, ah, let's piss rats.
[00:10.020 --> 00:10.740]  One, go.
[00:13.340 --> 00:14.220]  All right.
[00:14.340 --> 00:15.060]  Let's keep it going.
[00:15.700 --> 00:17.100]  Let's do some courses.
[00:17.360 --> 00:18.400]  What are we doing?
[00:18.620 --> 00:18.880]  Done.
[00:18.940 --> 00:19.580]  Let's go next.
[00:19.820 --> 00:20.560]  Oh, minigames.
[00:21.300 --> 00:22.440]  You know, it's good.
[00:22.520 --> 00:24.220]  Welcome to the stream guys.
[00:24.300 --> 00:26.440]  We're playing to 5.01 PM.
[00:26.840 --> 00:29.080]  The best time of the week.
[00:29.200 --> 00:29.880]  Let's take it.
[00:29.880 --> 00:30.200]  What?
[00:30.720 --> 00:31.980]  Uh, oh, we're shooting apples.
[00:32.360 --> 00:32.680]  Yeah.
[00:32.720 --> 00:34.460]  You got to shoot them down and then we have to catch them.
[00:34.580 --> 00:35.780]  What's the, am I asleep?
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.180]  What am I doing?
[00:37.860 --> 00:40.820]  Am I like, oh, avatar into this reticle.
[00:42.880 --> 00:44.000]  It's like a light gun game.
[00:44.500 --> 00:45.100]  Oh, okay.
[00:45.240 --> 00:46.200]  And then we have to catch them.
[00:46.680 --> 00:47.460]  All right.
[00:47.460 --> 00:48.260]  Catch all this shit.
[00:48.380 --> 00:49.380]  I'm knocking shit down now.
[00:50.220 --> 00:50.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:50.940 --> 00:52.760]  So it's gotta be a left and a right situation.
[00:53.280 --> 00:53.560]  All right.
[00:53.580 --> 00:53.920]  I got the left.
[00:54.020 --> 00:54.120]  Yeah.
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.780]  Well, it doesn't really help either.
[00:56.080 --> 00:57.100]  God, we're so slow.
[00:58.580 --> 00:59.220]  Oh God.
[00:59.220 --> 01:00.320]  So slow at the bottom.
[01:00.760 --> 01:01.120]  Yeah.
[01:01.140 --> 01:02.160]  It feels so slow.
[01:02.220 --> 01:02.820]  What the fuck?
[01:03.880 --> 01:04.240]  Nice.
[01:04.520 --> 01:05.700]  I feel like it's so slow at the bottom.
[01:09.580 --> 01:09.940]  Nice.
[01:10.520 --> 01:10.940]  Let me get right.
[01:11.000 --> 01:11.380]  Let me go to the right.
[01:11.800 --> 01:12.160]  Okay.
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.120]  Ah, I can't go that fast.
[01:15.540 --> 01:16.240]  How do we win?
[01:16.340 --> 01:16.860]  How does it end?
[01:16.880 --> 01:17.580]  We just need two more.
[01:17.580 --> 01:18.920]  We have to get two more.
[01:19.060 --> 01:19.200]  What do you mean?
[01:19.500 --> 01:23.320]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[01:23.500 --> 01:25.300]  Oh, no!
[01:26.800 --> 01:27.880]  You guys suck.
[01:28.310 --> 01:29.300]  I made it in.
[01:29.920 --> 01:30.960]  No, you didn't.
[01:31.020 --> 01:31.860]  All right, I'm on the left.
[01:32.000 --> 01:32.420]  I'm on the left.
[01:32.740 --> 01:33.360]  I'm on the right.
[01:33.760 --> 01:36.100]  To be honest, the first half of that was pressing A to shoot.
[01:37.260 --> 01:37.820]  Yeah, same.
[01:38.360 --> 01:39.000]  Got it.
[01:39.480 --> 01:40.760]  Till Andrew said X.
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.480]  Can't wait till I'm in.
[01:42.860 --> 01:45.560]  That, fuck that, fuck that particular apple.
[01:45.800 --> 01:46.480]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:46.660 --> 01:47.160]  Oh God.
[01:48.480 --> 01:48.740]  Nice.
[01:49.300 --> 01:49.640]  Oh shit.
[01:50.400 --> 01:50.980]  Catch that one.
[01:51.260 --> 01:51.460]  Catch that one.
[01:51.460 --> 01:52.780]  One shot, two kills for that one.
[01:53.140 --> 01:53.600]  Get that.
[01:53.720 --> 01:55.480]  I don't think I've missed one yet, buddy.
[01:55.880 --> 01:56.200]  Catch that.
[01:56.320 --> 01:56.880]  We're locked in.
[01:57.260 --> 01:58.320]  Left side locked in.
[01:58.500 --> 01:58.980]  Team left.
[01:59.300 --> 02:00.100]  Left side's locked, baby.
[02:00.500 --> 02:01.140]  Boom, got it.
[02:01.380 --> 02:01.540]  Boom.
[02:01.980 --> 02:03.800]  Okay, that was someone else shot that down.
[02:03.820 --> 02:04.580]  Yeah, that was not you.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.400]  Me and you.
[02:05.560 --> 02:05.920]  This is Team Tape.
[02:06.780 --> 02:07.460]  One more.
[02:07.620 --> 02:08.880]  This right here, this is Team Tape.
[02:08.980 --> 02:09.320]  Missed.
[02:09.680 --> 02:09.920]  Boom.
[02:09.980 --> 02:10.320]  Got it.
[02:10.420 --> 02:11.000]  Don't worry about it.
[02:11.560 --> 02:12.440]  Team Tape's got it.
[02:12.480 --> 02:13.700]  Get the fuck out of the way.
[02:13.980 --> 02:14.480]  Team Tape's got it.
[02:14.520 --> 02:14.860]  Easy.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.000]  Way to go, Ian.
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.740]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I was looking at the wrong guy.
[02:18.900 --> 02:20.440]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[02:20.460 --> 02:21.780]  Oh my Lord.
[02:22.500 --> 02:22.840]  It's fine.
[02:23.100 --> 02:25.740]  Tyler Oak, SDP with five subs.
[02:25.740 --> 02:26.760]  Oh, thank you.
[02:26.760 --> 02:29.480]  Tyler Oak, I'm caught, Reed.
[02:29.660 --> 02:30.140]  Someone else, Reed.
[02:30.140 --> 02:30.660]  Are you all right?
[02:30.780 --> 02:31.000]  Yeah.
[02:31.160 --> 02:31.800]  Are you okay?
[02:32.340 --> 02:33.360]  Gat 7 is a trope.
[02:34.320 --> 02:36.380]  Does it smell like pennies right now to you?
[02:39.540 --> 02:41.720]  If I flubbed your name, I deeply apologize.
[02:42.080 --> 02:42.300]  What?
[02:42.660 --> 02:45.700]  We have to catch him and then shoot him into...
[02:45.700 --> 02:46.060]  Okay.
[02:46.520 --> 02:47.520]  Oh, fuck me.
[02:48.240 --> 02:49.280]  What a clunk.
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.660]  And how do you shoot?
[02:51.100 --> 02:51.420]  X.
[02:51.620 --> 02:51.800]  X.
[02:52.040 --> 02:52.340]  Fuck.
[02:52.960 --> 02:53.580]  This is hard.
[02:54.060 --> 02:54.700]  Bulls hit.
[02:55.480 --> 02:55.840]  Oh.
[02:55.840 --> 02:57.120]  I'm just trying to get some...
[02:57.120 --> 02:57.960]  Oh my God.
[02:58.720 --> 02:59.960]  Geoff, you got the bulls?
[03:01.880 --> 03:02.820]  Okay, I got one in.
[03:03.960 --> 03:04.940]  Hard to get it in.
[03:05.660 --> 03:05.920]  Yeah.
[03:07.180 --> 03:07.900]  Ah, shit.
[03:08.480 --> 03:09.900]  Dude, this is tough.
[03:10.120 --> 03:11.760]  Dude, I can't get a dick in this.
[03:12.240 --> 03:12.600]  Shit.
[03:12.780 --> 03:13.380]  Oh my God.
[03:15.200 --> 03:15.440]  Ah.
[03:15.580 --> 03:16.660]  Oh my God.
[03:16.700 --> 03:18.260]  All right, I'm learning, I'm learning here.
[03:19.300 --> 03:19.540]  Too much.
[03:19.540 --> 03:20.500]  That's gotta be it.
[03:20.600 --> 03:21.260]  Oh no, stop.
[03:21.820 --> 03:22.060]  Okay.
[03:22.340 --> 03:22.760]  God damn it.
[03:22.860 --> 03:23.160]  Oh, there.
[03:23.180 --> 03:23.920]  I've gotten two in.
[03:23.940 --> 03:24.580]  That's not gonna be it.
[03:24.580 --> 03:26.260]  Oh, I'm teasing the rim here.
[03:26.360 --> 03:26.580]  Ah.
[03:27.660 --> 03:28.700]  Ah, fuck me.
[03:29.120 --> 03:30.140]  Dude, this is...
[03:31.180 --> 03:31.940]  Okay, got one.
[03:32.060 --> 03:32.180]  Go.
[03:33.060 --> 03:33.500]  Yeah.
[03:33.500 --> 03:33.920]  Stop.
[03:34.280 --> 03:34.800]  Got two.
[03:35.600 --> 03:36.280]  Oh my God.
[03:36.700 --> 03:37.140]  Fucking...
[03:37.140 --> 03:37.560]  Damn it.
[03:38.340 --> 03:38.900]  Damn it.
[03:40.880 --> 03:41.320]  Three.
[03:41.560 --> 03:42.140]  Dude, dude.
[03:42.160 --> 03:42.540]  Damn it.
[03:42.760 --> 03:43.040]  Oh, we're screwed.
[03:43.560 --> 03:45.840]  Woo, this one is rough, boys.
[03:46.040 --> 03:46.260]  Oh my God.
[03:46.260 --> 03:47.640]  This one will take us to 501.
[03:48.180 --> 03:50.360]  All right, go all the way over to the left there and I'll...
[03:50.360 --> 03:51.020]  Thanks, Andrew.
[03:51.080 --> 03:51.700]  Way to go, dude.
[03:52.240 --> 03:53.040]  I'm just holding right.
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.920]  Max to how many we, uh, we can hold.
[03:56.820 --> 03:57.940]  No, I don't think so.
[03:57.940 --> 03:58.940]  Not that I know of.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.140]  I haven't reached it if there is.
[04:00.260 --> 04:01.420]  Ah, damn you, me.
[04:02.420 --> 04:03.100]  Oh, straight up.
[04:03.180 --> 04:03.320]  Brilliant.
[04:03.680 --> 04:03.700]  Whoa.
[04:03.980 --> 04:04.660]  Nice one, Gigi's.
[04:04.660 --> 04:05.020]  Get down, crazy.
[04:06.200 --> 04:07.480]  Okay, get on the shelf, man.
[04:07.580 --> 04:08.680]  Too much.
[04:11.120 --> 04:11.540]  God.
[04:11.540 --> 04:12.720]  I almost scored in the other hoop.
[04:13.600 --> 04:14.280]  There's one.
[04:14.940 --> 04:15.820]  Oh, come on.
[04:16.840 --> 04:18.800]  Oh, I scored in the one I wasn't aiming for.
[04:19.300 --> 04:19.520]  Cool.
[04:20.380 --> 04:21.740]  Yay, I did it.
[04:21.860 --> 04:22.020]  Damn.
[04:22.500 --> 04:23.300]  Damn, I suck.
[04:23.420 --> 04:24.380]  Geoff, you got ten more.
[04:24.460 --> 04:24.820]  No, you bitch.
[04:26.180 --> 04:26.780]  Got it.
[04:26.880 --> 04:27.140]  Cool.
[04:27.340 --> 04:28.260]  Come on, Andrew, get one.
[04:28.460 --> 04:28.600]  Oh.
[04:28.920 --> 04:29.220]  Fuck.
[04:29.240 --> 04:29.360]  Oh.
[04:29.760 --> 04:30.480]  Oh, fuck.
[04:30.480 --> 04:30.980]  Come on, Andrew.
[04:31.260 --> 04:31.480]  Asshole.
[04:31.800 --> 04:32.080]  There we go.
[04:32.140 --> 04:32.520]  There we go.
[04:32.600 --> 04:32.820]  All right.
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.060]  All right.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.760]  Far side, far side, far side, far side, far side.
[04:35.360 --> 04:36.560]  I teased both rimballs.
[04:36.660 --> 04:37.200]  Yeah, God.
[04:37.640 --> 04:38.460]  Damn, I suck.
[04:39.960 --> 04:42.440]  It's so hard to do this.
[04:42.940 --> 04:43.100]  Got one.
[04:43.400 --> 04:44.920]  Get two more before we all die.
[04:45.120 --> 04:45.880]  This is pretty tough.
[04:45.940 --> 04:46.040]  Got two.
[04:46.480 --> 04:46.760]  Nope.
[04:47.220 --> 04:47.920]  Oh, one more.
[04:49.820 --> 04:51.320]  This is a tough one.
[04:51.340 --> 04:51.740]  Not easy.
[04:52.020 --> 04:53.740]  No, this is, this is really hard.
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.200]  I'm good at getting snow.
[04:55.560 --> 04:56.140]  That's it.
[04:57.720 --> 04:59.700]  You think, you think it's snow?
[05:00.600 --> 05:01.600]  No, it's asbestos.
[05:02.320 --> 05:02.740]  Oh.
[05:03.120 --> 05:04.240]  Look at my little snowballs.
[05:04.260 --> 05:04.420]  Hey, I got one.
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.900]  How do I?
[05:07.740 --> 05:08.080]  Oof.
[05:09.060 --> 05:09.920]  Oh, bullshit.
[05:10.500 --> 05:10.780]  Fuck.
[05:12.460 --> 05:12.940]  Bullshit.
[05:12.960 --> 05:13.580]  Get in there, you.
[05:13.860 --> 05:14.480]  Fuck you.
[05:15.820 --> 05:16.560]  Get in there.
[05:16.660 --> 05:17.380]  Get in there, you.
[05:17.400 --> 05:17.860]  No.
[05:18.720 --> 05:19.200]  Three.
[05:19.560 --> 05:20.360]  Get in there, you.
[05:21.120 --> 05:22.040]  Fucking three in a row.
[05:23.800 --> 05:25.180]  Misses that fucking hubris.
[05:25.460 --> 05:26.200]  That's my own fault.
[05:27.100 --> 05:28.340]  Get in there, bitch.
[05:28.620 --> 05:29.760]  Going over to this side.
[05:29.860 --> 05:30.520]  There we go.
[05:30.620 --> 05:30.720]  One more.
[05:31.160 --> 05:31.700]  That was nuts.
[05:31.820 --> 05:32.220]  It bounced off.
[05:32.220 --> 05:32.520]  There it is.
[05:32.620 --> 05:32.940]  Get in.
[05:32.980 --> 05:33.780]  Get the key.
[05:33.940 --> 05:34.120]  Get in.
[05:34.120 --> 05:35.860]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:36.040 --> 05:36.680]  Get out of the way.
[05:36.960 --> 05:37.140]  Get out of the way.
[05:37.780 --> 05:38.800]  Get out of the way.
[05:39.700 --> 05:40.200]  God damn.
[05:40.200 --> 05:41.100]  Oh my God, dude.
[05:41.100 --> 05:42.300]  That's the game of my life right there.
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.480]  I didn't hit a single one.
[05:44.640 --> 05:45.120]  Good job, Geoff.
[05:45.560 --> 05:46.200]  I got one.
[05:46.260 --> 05:47.720]  I think it bounced off Eric's forehead.
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.900]  That was the only round I got a ball in.
[05:51.900 --> 05:53.340]  It like clicked for me all at once.
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.160]  Mini games three.
[05:57.680 --> 05:58.480]  Oh, this shit.
[05:58.720 --> 05:59.240]  Oh, that's a bomb.
[05:59.300 --> 05:59.820]  Don't hit the bomb.
[06:00.340 --> 06:00.940]  Oh, all right.
[06:01.100 --> 06:01.840]  Somebody come to the right.
[06:01.940 --> 06:02.640]  Somebody come to the right.
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.320]  Somebody come to the right.
[06:04.500 --> 06:04.640]  Somebody come to the right.
[06:04.640 --> 06:05.360]  Somebody come to the right.
[06:05.500 --> 06:06.080]  I'm coming to the right.
[06:06.280 --> 06:06.480]  All right.
[06:06.600 --> 06:06.960]  Oh, it's a bomb.
[06:07.400 --> 06:07.840]  There you go.
[06:07.960 --> 06:08.100]  Got it.
[06:09.500 --> 06:10.040]  Oh, sorry.
[06:10.320 --> 06:10.360]  It really is slow, huh?
[06:11.260 --> 06:14.520]  I'm trying to lock in with you here, but it looks like Andrew's locked in with you here.
[06:14.700 --> 06:15.920]  So I'm just going to let it be.
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.040]  It looks like, uh, it's like you guys got a situation going.
[06:19.600 --> 06:21.160]  Wait for that to become appley.
[06:21.500 --> 06:22.040]  There you go.
[06:22.740 --> 06:23.240]  Nice.
[06:24.680 --> 06:25.960]  Oh, there you go.
[06:26.020 --> 06:26.400]  Okay.
[06:26.520 --> 06:26.780]  So.
[06:27.620 --> 06:28.380]  Every ball's an apple.
[06:28.580 --> 06:30.280]  Looks like maybe you guys aren't on the same page.
[06:30.560 --> 06:31.360]  I don't know.
[06:31.380 --> 06:31.740]  I'm trying.
[06:32.380 --> 06:33.320]  There you go.
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.100]  I'm trying.
[06:34.440 --> 06:35.020]  I damn this.
[06:35.280 --> 06:35.680]  Not the...
[06:35.680 --> 06:35.920]  Shit.
[06:35.960 --> 06:36.360]  Oh.
[06:36.680 --> 06:36.900]  Yep.
[06:37.220 --> 06:37.520]  I know.
[06:37.680 --> 06:37.900]  Team Lasso.
[06:38.300 --> 06:39.980]  You bombed me twice in a row.
[06:40.080 --> 06:42.620]  Now, I do think that Andrew said...
[06:42.620 --> 06:45.180]  I think that was Geoff's fault.
[06:45.180 --> 06:46.300]  And that was pretty exciting.
[06:47.080 --> 06:48.560]  One of these, Nick, get one of them.
[06:48.780 --> 06:49.300]  One of them, Nick.
[06:49.580 --> 06:49.740]  There you go.
[06:49.780 --> 06:50.220]  It's me!
[06:50.400 --> 06:50.920]  It's me!
[06:51.080 --> 06:51.400]  It's me!
[06:51.800 --> 06:52.140]  There you go.
[06:52.200 --> 06:52.540]  There you go.
[06:52.860 --> 06:53.180]  Ah!
[06:53.780 --> 06:54.960]  Dude, we were doing all right.
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.160]  Yeah, we were doing good.
[06:56.180 --> 06:56.900]  Yeah, and I don't...
[06:56.900 --> 06:59.100]  The right side looked like it was maybe having a little trouble.
[06:59.100 --> 06:59.960]  Doing my best!
[07:00.040 --> 07:00.340]  We're getting...
[07:00.340 --> 07:00.840]  Hey, Gavin.
[07:01.100 --> 07:01.880]  No, hey, hey.
[07:01.980 --> 07:03.020]  I don't feel like it was you, buddy.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.420]  It was both of us.
[07:06.620 --> 07:06.900]  We're good.
[07:07.860 --> 07:08.180]  Okay.
[07:08.340 --> 07:08.660]  Got one.
[07:08.920 --> 07:09.660]  Me, me and you, Gavin.
[07:10.060 --> 07:10.380]  Two.
[07:10.940 --> 07:11.360]  Locked in.
[07:11.500 --> 07:11.900]  Locked in.
[07:11.920 --> 07:12.160]  Three.
[07:12.340 --> 07:13.060]  We're killing it, Andrew.
[07:13.060 --> 07:13.580]  Killing it.
[07:13.660 --> 07:13.940]  Four.
[07:14.700 --> 07:15.200]  Stay away.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.500]  That was my bad.
[07:16.700 --> 07:17.240]  Yeah, it was too far.
[07:17.420 --> 07:17.560]  All right.
[07:17.560 --> 07:17.940]  There you go.
[07:18.920 --> 07:19.200]  Five.
[07:19.340 --> 07:20.380]  Hell yeah, man.
[07:20.960 --> 07:21.640]  Oh, watch out.
[07:21.720 --> 07:22.080]  I got it.
[07:22.080 --> 07:23.240]  That's what I'm talking about, Andrew.
[07:23.320 --> 07:23.660]  I got it.
[07:24.000 --> 07:24.640]  Six, seven.
[07:25.060 --> 07:25.380]  We're locked in.
[07:25.440 --> 07:25.800]  We're locked in.
[07:25.860 --> 07:26.200]  We're locked in.
[07:26.280 --> 07:27.440]  I'm gonna wait for this to de-bomb.
[07:28.000 --> 07:28.360]  There we go.
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.060]  Got it.
[07:29.120 --> 07:29.540]  Oh, perfect.
[07:29.960 --> 07:30.840]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[07:31.780 --> 07:32.020]  Oh, shit.
[07:32.020 --> 07:32.760]  I don't think I'm gonna make that one.
[07:32.880 --> 07:32.960]  Sorry.
[07:33.160 --> 07:33.500]  Got it.
[07:33.620 --> 07:33.840]  You're good.
[07:34.080 --> 07:34.300]  That's fine.
[07:35.760 --> 07:36.780]  Okay, I'm gonna get this one next.
[07:38.440 --> 07:38.720]  Ah!
[07:38.860 --> 07:39.260]  Too far.
[07:39.280 --> 07:40.020]  Sorry, I tried too far.
[07:40.020 --> 07:40.460]  That's on me.
[07:40.500 --> 07:40.880]  That's on me.
[07:41.360 --> 07:41.640]  Sorry.
[07:41.920 --> 07:42.460]  Good dodge.
[07:42.560 --> 07:42.880]  Good dodge.
[07:43.140 --> 07:44.060]  Okay, got that one.
[07:44.700 --> 07:44.860]  That one.
[07:44.880 --> 07:45.200]  Yeah, get it.
[07:45.340 --> 07:45.560]  Get it.
[07:45.680 --> 07:45.900]  Get it.
[07:46.420 --> 07:47.100]  No, watch out!
[07:47.340 --> 07:47.680]  We're good?
[07:49.020 --> 07:49.600]  All right, got it.
[07:49.600 --> 07:49.900]  There we go.
[07:51.200 --> 07:52.340]  Oh no, I'm not gonna make it.
[07:52.480 --> 07:53.240]  I'm not gonna make it.
[07:57.370 --> 07:58.190]  You did great, Andrew.
[07:58.190 --> 07:58.370]  Damn, Gavin.
[07:58.410 --> 07:59.470]  I felt like we were locked in too.
[07:59.490 --> 08:00.670]  Yeah, I felt like we did really good.
[08:00.870 --> 08:02.030]  Oh, I'm on the ground now.
[08:02.110 --> 08:03.590]  Oh, now it fucking switched on us.
[08:04.290 --> 08:04.850]  It's gone.
[08:08.410 --> 08:08.690]  Uh...
[08:09.290 --> 08:09.850]  This one...
[08:09.850 --> 08:10.150]  Don't look at me.
[08:10.570 --> 08:10.810]  Oh no!
[08:10.850 --> 08:11.070]  Oh!
[08:11.270 --> 08:11.430]  Ah!
[08:11.430 --> 08:12.130]  Got it.
[08:12.150 --> 08:12.870]  Gavin, shoot it!
[08:14.150 --> 08:14.750]  I'm just gonna...
[08:14.750 --> 08:15.710]  I'm gonna leave it to...
[08:15.710 --> 08:16.150]  Good job, Gavin.
[08:16.230 --> 08:17.390]  ...to you two over here on the right.
[08:17.470 --> 08:18.510]  You guys seem like you're locked in.
[08:19.110 --> 08:20.050]  Gavin, what'd you call us earlier?
[08:20.390 --> 08:21.010]  Sorry, I can't...
[08:21.010 --> 08:21.030]  Sorry.
[08:21.550 --> 08:22.010]  Hell yeah.
[08:22.050 --> 08:22.630]  Fuck, that one's okay.
[08:23.490 --> 08:24.130]  That's all good.
[08:24.250 --> 08:24.650]  It's all good.
[08:25.050 --> 08:25.530]  All right, there you go.
[08:25.570 --> 08:26.070]  Can you get...
[08:26.070 --> 08:26.510]  Yeah!
[08:26.710 --> 08:27.410]  Get this one.
[08:28.070 --> 08:28.510]  No, no!
[08:28.550 --> 08:28.870]  Ah!
[08:29.430 --> 08:31.210]  It became a bomb as I shot it.
[08:31.550 --> 08:32.450]  I know, as you shot it.
[08:32.470 --> 08:32.830]  It wasn't your fault.
[08:32.830 --> 08:33.610]  It wasn't your fault.
[08:33.950 --> 08:34.330]  That was...
[08:34.330 --> 08:34.570]  Ah, damn.
[08:34.570 --> 08:35.150]  It wasn't your fault.
[08:35.170 --> 08:35.490]  Bad bounce.
[08:35.510 --> 08:36.490]  At least it might be, though.
[08:36.950 --> 08:37.450]  There we go.
[08:37.470 --> 08:37.910]  Nine more!
[08:39.570 --> 08:41.010]  Here we go, you can get that one.
[08:41.170 --> 08:41.930]  Got it, got it, got it.
[08:41.950 --> 08:42.530]  Shoot that one, Gavin.
[08:42.850 --> 08:43.410]  Nice shot.
[08:43.510 --> 08:44.170]  It was a good shot.
[08:44.270 --> 08:44.730]  It was a good shot.
[08:45.130 --> 08:45.490]  That one?
[08:45.630 --> 08:45.770]  Yeah.
[08:46.010 --> 08:46.230]  God damn it.
[08:46.350 --> 08:47.030]  All right, what about this one?
[08:48.530 --> 08:48.810]  Perfect.
[08:49.550 --> 08:50.110]  Three more.
[08:50.250 --> 08:50.750]  That one.
[08:50.970 --> 08:51.550]  Two more.
[08:51.890 --> 08:53.010]  Oh, I turned it into an apple.
[08:53.150 --> 08:53.730]  Let's do that one, Andrew.
[08:54.590 --> 08:54.870]  Ah!
[08:55.630 --> 08:56.070]  I'm up.
[08:56.470 --> 08:57.010]  Holy shit.
[08:57.090 --> 08:57.390]  You can try.
[08:57.390 --> 08:59.190]  Stopping Earth 94, 10 gifted subs.
[08:59.490 --> 08:59.870]  Thanks, son.
[09:00.190 --> 09:00.790]  Damn, hell yeah.
[09:01.150 --> 09:01.390]  All right.
[09:01.470 --> 09:02.370]  Okay, back to the guns.
[09:02.410 --> 09:03.630]  Hang on, Andrew, go to the right.
[09:03.770 --> 09:04.390]  Andrew, go to the right.
[09:04.450 --> 09:04.670]  Who?
[09:04.750 --> 09:04.890]  Okay.
[09:05.850 --> 09:06.130]  Oh.
[09:06.130 --> 09:06.650]  All right.
[09:08.090 --> 09:08.930]  All right, Andrew.
[09:09.030 --> 09:09.650]  Good one.
[09:11.090 --> 09:11.710]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:12.110 --> 09:12.550]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:12.810 --> 09:13.690]  And we get to do this one, Andrew.
[09:13.790 --> 09:14.010]  Get it.
[09:14.050 --> 09:14.150]  Right?
[09:14.270 --> 09:14.930]  Right down the middle.
[09:15.390 --> 09:15.730]  Got it.
[09:15.910 --> 09:16.830]  I'm watching you, I'm watching you.
[09:16.850 --> 09:17.910]  Took a weird, it just took a weird hop.
[09:18.190 --> 09:19.250]  Two, three, whatever.
[09:19.770 --> 09:20.550]  Oh, that worked out well.
[09:20.850 --> 09:21.230]  Yeah, lucky.
[09:21.430 --> 09:21.910]  Fuck, that's my bad.
[09:22.270 --> 09:23.850]  Yeah, this is, this is not good.
[09:24.710 --> 09:24.830]  Woo!
[09:25.090 --> 09:25.490]  Got it?
[09:25.690 --> 09:26.130]  There you go.
[09:28.730 --> 09:29.050]  Nice.
[09:29.850 --> 09:30.170]  Nope.
[09:30.570 --> 09:30.850]  Sorry.
[09:31.090 --> 09:31.410]  Perfect.
[09:34.390 --> 09:35.450]  Are you going to subscribe?
[09:35.510 --> 09:36.010]  God damn.
[09:36.130 --> 09:36.550]  There you go.
[09:36.610 --> 09:36.910]  That's okay.
[09:37.170 --> 09:37.750]  I think he's having fun shooting apples.
[09:38.430 --> 09:40.230]  Are you only, what am I, what else am I going to do?
[09:40.270 --> 09:42.290]  No one's catching them, but he's, but he's shooting them.
[09:42.550 --> 09:43.350]  You caught a couple.
[09:45.090 --> 09:45.850]  This thing's getting hard.
[09:45.970 --> 09:46.130]  Do it, Gavin.
[09:46.370 --> 09:46.610]  Hit.
[09:46.770 --> 09:47.030]  Woo!
[09:47.610 --> 09:48.110]  Got it.
[09:48.570 --> 09:48.870]  Bottom.
[09:49.110 --> 09:49.330]  All right.
[09:49.370 --> 09:49.630]  Perfect.
[09:50.770 --> 09:51.830]  Oh, good job, Geoff.
[09:52.410 --> 09:53.230]  No time, no time.
[09:53.250 --> 09:53.310]  Nice.
[09:53.650 --> 09:54.290]  All right, do it again, boys.
[09:54.470 --> 09:54.610]  We lost.
[09:54.830 --> 09:55.130]  Do it again.
[09:55.450 --> 09:56.630]  How close were we?
[09:57.030 --> 09:58.050]  I think we need one more.
[09:58.470 --> 09:59.930]  This is very hard.
[10:01.070 --> 10:02.610]  This is hard, Andrew.
[10:02.790 --> 10:03.130]  I'm on the ground.
[10:03.630 --> 10:03.810]  Okay.
[10:04.170 --> 10:05.070]  Why am I always shooting?
[10:05.150 --> 10:05.690]  I'm terrible.
[10:06.130 --> 10:06.470]  Yeah.
[10:06.630 --> 10:07.150]  There we go.
[10:08.010 --> 10:09.370]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[10:09.450 --> 10:09.850]  That was my bad.
[10:10.290 --> 10:10.790]  That's okay.
[10:11.390 --> 10:11.730]  All right.
[10:11.790 --> 10:12.710]  We're, we might be boned.
[10:12.710 --> 10:13.150]  Fuck, it just appeared.
[10:13.330 --> 10:13.850]  Right when I got it.
[10:13.850 --> 10:14.030]  Oh!
[10:14.410 --> 10:14.630]  Okay.
[10:14.730 --> 10:15.150]  Hang on here.
[10:17.310 --> 10:18.130]  Nice, Geoff.
[10:18.390 --> 10:19.370]  You're a great shot, Andrew.
[10:19.670 --> 10:20.130]  There we go.
[10:20.150 --> 10:20.590]  Yeah, Gavin!
[10:21.430 --> 10:21.790]  Okay.
[10:21.950 --> 10:22.110]  Oh.
[10:22.270 --> 10:22.810]  Oh shit.
[10:22.830 --> 10:23.350]  Oh, perfect.
[10:23.730 --> 10:25.490]  Oh, I'm glad I missed.
[10:26.070 --> 10:26.930]  Oh, I got it.
[10:27.170 --> 10:27.610]  Holy shit.
[10:28.070 --> 10:29.710]  I'm just trying to get these bombs out of the middle.
[10:29.890 --> 10:30.150]  Okay.
[10:30.450 --> 10:30.830]  All right.
[10:31.090 --> 10:31.350]  Okay.
[10:31.450 --> 10:31.670]  Ah.
[10:32.170 --> 10:32.670]  All right.
[10:33.010 --> 10:34.410]  Ignore anything that's in the middle.
[10:35.230 --> 10:36.190]  Ignore anything in the middle.
[10:36.270 --> 10:39.390]  I'm just trying to get these bombs out of here so they still shine up to you guys as apples.
[10:39.950 --> 10:40.790]  No, I think that was an apple.
[10:41.010 --> 10:41.770]  That was like one frame.
[10:42.270 --> 10:42.770]  Ah, that was me.
[10:42.830 --> 10:43.130]  That was me.
[10:43.170 --> 10:43.450]  That was me.
[10:43.490 --> 10:44.130]  I shot on the wrong side.
[10:44.490 --> 10:44.990]  Nice shot.
[10:45.070 --> 10:45.430]  Nice shot.
[10:45.510 --> 10:46.030]  Yes, yes, yes.
[10:46.130 --> 10:46.910]  Oh, don't worry about that one.
[10:47.010 --> 10:47.570]  No, no, no!
[10:47.890 --> 10:48.490]  Don't worry about these.
[10:48.670 --> 10:48.890]  Yes!
[10:48.890 --> 10:49.630]  Don't worry about those.
[10:49.750 --> 10:50.130]  Two more.
[10:50.210 --> 10:50.350]  Yep.
[10:50.890 --> 10:51.230]  One more!
[10:51.430 --> 10:51.530]  One more!
[10:53.310 --> 10:54.130]  It's going to be an apple!
[10:54.310 --> 10:54.790]  Get in, boys!
[10:54.870 --> 10:55.250]  Get in!
[10:56.150 --> 10:56.870]  God damn it!
[10:57.390 --> 10:58.590]  Son of a bitch!
[10:59.930 --> 11:02.270]  Man, Andrew, I don't know how much better we can do, man.
[11:02.390 --> 11:03.730]  I really missed two apples.
[11:05.030 --> 11:06.490]  Okay, I'm on the left this time.
[11:06.790 --> 11:07.270]  Damn it!
[11:07.290 --> 11:08.030]  I'm right on the right.
[11:09.050 --> 11:09.530]  Oh boy.
[11:09.770 --> 11:11.610]  Okay, I got one, two...
[11:11.610 --> 11:12.030]  Okay.
[11:12.230 --> 11:12.690]  Oh boy.
[11:12.930 --> 11:13.470]  Come to the top.
[11:14.150 --> 11:14.950]  Who's shooting me?
[11:16.190 --> 11:16.950]  Are you orange?
[11:17.270 --> 11:17.770]  Who's green?
[11:17.870 --> 11:17.990]  Yeah.
[11:18.050 --> 11:18.990]  Oh, oh, watch it, watch it.
[11:19.230 --> 11:19.670]  Yeah, it's me.
[11:20.170 --> 11:20.590]  You're doing good.
[11:21.330 --> 11:21.650]  Thanks.
[11:23.810 --> 11:24.330]  I was on a run.
[11:24.410 --> 11:25.510]  I have a good thing going right now.
[11:25.590 --> 11:27.010]  I was on a run and then I blew it.
[11:27.510 --> 11:27.990]  Uh, go left.
[11:28.270 --> 11:28.590]  There you go.
[11:28.610 --> 11:28.850]  Shit.
[11:29.110 --> 11:29.370]  Sorry.
[11:29.490 --> 11:29.850]  Here we go.
[11:30.190 --> 11:30.510]  Right there.
[11:31.010 --> 11:31.470]  Right in front of me.
[11:31.550 --> 11:31.910]  Right, right.
[11:32.070 --> 11:32.650]  Ah, damn it.
[11:33.030 --> 11:33.410]  There we go.
[11:33.490 --> 11:33.770]  Apple!
[11:33.770 --> 11:34.450]  Got it.
[11:34.470 --> 11:34.730]  Got it.
[11:34.950 --> 11:35.530]  There you go.
[11:35.610 --> 11:36.110]  Here comes low.
[11:36.190 --> 11:36.390]  Okay.
[11:36.410 --> 11:37.230]  You got it.
[11:37.230 --> 11:37.530]  Good.
[11:38.910 --> 11:39.230]  Perfect.
[11:40.790 --> 11:41.350]  Here it comes.
[11:41.450 --> 11:42.170]  Save just one more.
[11:42.390 --> 11:43.190]  I'm not going to get to it.
[11:43.190 --> 11:43.550]  Come back!
[11:45.190 --> 11:45.510]  Oh!
[11:45.630 --> 11:46.130]  All right, we got it.
[11:46.150 --> 11:46.370]  We got it.
[11:46.410 --> 11:46.650]  We got it.
[11:46.730 --> 11:46.950]  Okay.
[11:47.170 --> 11:49.170]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[11:49.530 --> 11:51.730]  Oh, good job.
[11:51.970 --> 11:53.290]  Get in the thing, Devin!
[11:53.950 --> 11:55.530]  Guys, I want to thank you for watching.
[11:55.810 --> 11:56.750]  We're going to 501.
[11:56.850 --> 11:57.690]  I really appreciate it.
[12:01.590 --> 12:02.950]  That was insane.
[12:03.510 --> 12:04.310]  That's a tough one.
[12:04.330 --> 12:04.950]  Those are tough.
[12:06.050 --> 12:09.070]  I just, I'm glad we don't have to shoot any more apples off our heads or snowballs
[12:09.070 --> 12:09.570]  or whatever.
[12:09.730 --> 12:10.410]  What are we doing now?
[12:10.510 --> 12:10.870]  Here we go.
[12:12.410 --> 12:13.330]  Wait, way to go.
[12:14.770 --> 12:15.330]  Hi, Geoff.
[12:15.430 --> 12:16.470]  Remember where you were, man.
[12:16.730 --> 12:17.630]  We got this back.
[12:17.850 --> 12:18.350]  Oh, shit.
[12:18.450 --> 12:18.870]  That just went straight up.
[12:18.870 --> 12:20.890]  We can barely do this without impending.
[12:21.090 --> 12:21.630]  Oh, shit.
[12:21.990 --> 12:22.530]  But too much.
[12:22.990 --> 12:23.710]  I just need ammunition.
[12:23.830 --> 12:25.430]  Nick almost had a 44 on the thought.
[12:25.510 --> 12:26.330]  That was pretty good, man.
[12:26.330 --> 12:26.750]  Blue fucked me there.
[12:27.070 --> 12:27.610]  I had the thought.
[12:27.710 --> 12:29.010]  I just didn't have the ability to speak it.
[12:29.230 --> 12:30.410]  Oh, you involved this one over into me.
[12:30.410 --> 12:31.130]  Oh, I'm getting bumps to the cranium.
[12:31.610 --> 12:32.750]  Oh, I'm so constantly
[12:32.750 --> 12:33.870]  getting done in.
[12:35.510 --> 12:36.150]  Dammit, Geoff.
[12:36.310 --> 12:36.770]  Please, sir.
[12:36.830 --> 12:37.510]  I want to die.
[12:37.910 --> 12:38.110]  Oh, shit.
[12:38.250 --> 12:38.670]  Dammit, Geoff.
[12:38.710 --> 12:39.490]  Oh, shit.
[12:40.650 --> 12:42.570]  Man, the bombs will freak you the fuck out.
[12:45.490 --> 12:46.670]  Come on, you...
[12:48.150 --> 12:48.870]  That worked?
[12:50.490 --> 12:50.930]  Goalkeeper?
[12:51.530 --> 12:51.970]  Terrible.
[12:52.270 --> 12:52.350]  Fuck.
[12:52.610 --> 12:53.450]  Can you get off me?
[12:53.730 --> 12:53.870]  Thank you.
[12:54.210 --> 12:54.910]  Here we go.
[12:54.970 --> 12:55.290]  Sorry.
[12:55.810 --> 12:56.110]  Bomb.
[12:57.990 --> 12:59.110]  Oh, too high?
[12:59.430 --> 13:00.350]  Oh, I fucked up.
[13:01.190 --> 13:01.630]  Dammit.
[13:02.990 --> 13:04.890]  Too much, too much, too much.
[13:05.090 --> 13:05.550]  One way.
[13:05.670 --> 13:06.010]  Here we go.
[13:06.510 --> 13:06.970]  There we go.
[13:09.570 --> 13:10.490]  There we go.
[13:10.570 --> 13:12.190]  Oh, you can move after you've charged it?
[13:12.450 --> 13:12.930]  I'm a schmuck.
[13:14.070 --> 13:14.330]  What?
[13:14.510 --> 13:14.990]  There we go.
[13:15.110 --> 13:15.530]  That's done.
[13:15.830 --> 13:16.370]  You didn't know that?
[13:17.490 --> 13:18.510]  No, I didn't.
[13:21.210 --> 13:21.890]  I didn't.
[13:22.770 --> 13:23.830]  Well, it's a nice run.
[13:23.830 --> 13:24.430]  Got two more.
[13:24.690 --> 13:25.090]  Two more.
[13:25.290 --> 13:25.790]  Oh, one more.
[13:25.830 --> 13:26.130]  One more.
[13:26.650 --> 13:27.050]  That's all right.
[13:27.110 --> 13:28.170]  We got it on the next one.
[13:28.230 --> 13:28.810]  We got it on the next one.
[13:29.070 --> 13:31.730]  Gavin knows that you can move after you charge it, so he's got it now.
[13:31.730 --> 13:32.390]  I thought I thought.
[13:32.630 --> 13:33.690]  Now we're all set.
[13:38.630 --> 13:39.110]  Nice.
[13:39.450 --> 13:40.250]  Good shot, Andrew.
[13:40.530 --> 13:40.910]  Thank you.
[13:41.330 --> 13:42.390]  Oh, come on.
[13:42.790 --> 13:43.730]  Ah, just off.
[13:44.750 --> 13:45.210]  Get in!
[13:45.310 --> 13:45.570]  Use.
[13:46.510 --> 13:48.710]  Oh, way too far.
[13:49.650 --> 13:50.810]  Why'd you do that, Geoff?
[13:51.990 --> 13:53.610]  Oh, that was so close, Eric.
[13:53.930 --> 13:54.070]  One.
[13:54.210 --> 13:55.130]  Oh, God damn.
[13:55.330 --> 13:55.490]  Rimmed it.
[13:55.970 --> 13:57.010]  It's brutal.
[13:57.590 --> 13:58.050]  Brutal.
[13:59.450 --> 13:59.930]  Nice.
[14:00.050 --> 14:00.330]  Yay.
[14:00.650 --> 14:00.870]  Good shot, Burble.
[14:01.470 --> 14:02.590]  Thank you, that's me.
[14:02.590 --> 14:03.030]  Andrew, one more.
[14:03.090 --> 14:03.670]  You got it.
[14:03.810 --> 14:04.090]  Uh oh.
[14:04.090 --> 14:04.490]  Damn it.
[14:04.770 --> 14:05.390]  Ah, bad angle.
[14:05.710 --> 14:06.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:07.130 --> 14:07.450]  Damn, man.
[14:07.510 --> 14:08.090]  What could you do?
[14:08.130 --> 14:08.530]  Got it!
[14:08.550 --> 14:09.770]  Oh, what an arc, dude.
[14:09.930 --> 14:10.690]  That was awesome.
[14:17.180 --> 14:17.320]  Hey.
[14:21.040 --> 14:21.520]  Damn it.
[14:22.400 --> 14:22.720]  No!
[14:23.500 --> 14:23.820]  Get it.
[14:23.880 --> 14:24.160]  Got it.
[14:24.180 --> 14:24.380]  There we go.
[14:24.780 --> 14:25.080]  There we go.
[14:25.100 --> 14:25.420]  There we go.
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.000]  Go, go, go.
[14:26.460 --> 14:27.100]  Get in it.
[14:30.650 --> 14:31.570]  Someone get a three pointer.
[14:32.570 --> 14:33.230]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[14:33.470 --> 14:33.970]  A trick shot.
[14:33.970 --> 14:35.370]  I'm the Celtics.
[14:41.030 --> 14:43.050]  Oh, glad that's done with.
[14:43.470 --> 14:44.730]  Good job with minigames.
[14:45.010 --> 14:45.990]  That's a chief.
[14:46.570 --> 14:47.290]  We did it, baby.
[14:48.150 --> 14:48.670]  Moving on.
[14:50.430 --> 14:51.750]  Moving on, baby.
[14:52.210 --> 14:53.690]  In the rear view mirror.
[14:54.970 --> 14:55.670]  Top down.
[14:55.790 --> 14:56.910]  Top down view.
[14:57.310 --> 14:58.910]  Don't know about this.
[14:59.850 --> 15:01.870]  Is it like the second level of Contra?
[15:02.510 --> 15:02.810]  What?
[15:04.410 --> 15:06.290]  Oh, what'd you die off?
[15:07.030 --> 15:07.730]  You killed a map.
[15:07.910 --> 15:08.230]  I don't see you.
[15:09.190 --> 15:10.210]  Oh, it's like a...
[15:11.370 --> 15:12.190]  Oh, you can't.
[15:12.270 --> 15:14.350]  Oh, if you touch the black, it's like falling in a hole.
[15:14.930 --> 15:15.110]  Got it.
[15:15.510 --> 15:17.550]  Oh, the black's a hole.
[15:19.130 --> 15:21.370]  Geoff, anytime you want to go, that'd be great.
[15:21.470 --> 15:21.810]  Anytime.
[15:22.170 --> 15:22.890]  Anytime, buddy.
[15:23.270 --> 15:23.990]  There you go.
[15:24.470 --> 15:25.110]  What did I...
[15:25.110 --> 15:25.350]  What?
[15:26.010 --> 15:26.810]  You fell in the black.
[15:27.610 --> 15:28.530]  Guys, do you have a shadow?
[15:28.690 --> 15:29.450]  Look at your shadow.
[15:29.750 --> 15:30.630]  My shadow.
[15:31.050 --> 15:31.510]  My shadow.
[15:31.570 --> 15:32.190]  Use your shadow.
[15:32.590 --> 15:33.150]  Yes, no, that's...
[15:33.150 --> 15:33.370]  What is the shadow?
[15:34.330 --> 15:35.430]  It tells you where you are.
[15:35.790 --> 15:36.390]  Somebody hit that.
[15:37.490 --> 15:38.670]  Yeah, but I'm on top of my shadow.
[15:39.550 --> 15:40.390]  Oh, my God.
[15:40.450 --> 15:40.910]  Hit the button.
[15:42.470 --> 15:43.810]  Just what a moron.
[15:43.910 --> 15:44.490]  I don't know, man.
[15:44.690 --> 15:45.110]  Who, me?
[15:46.010 --> 15:47.170]  Yeah, I'm really not sure what...
[15:47.990 --> 15:49.370]  Nick was saying, look at my shadow.
[15:49.470 --> 15:50.070]  It lets you know where you are.
[15:50.250 --> 15:52.830]  Use your shadow as an opportunity to see where you are.
[15:52.830 --> 15:53.310]  Wait, what?
[15:53.570 --> 15:53.830]  Hang on.
[15:54.270 --> 15:55.150]  But I know where I am.
[15:55.290 --> 15:56.670]  Get three on there.
[15:56.710 --> 15:57.530]  I'll be the fourth.
[15:58.030 --> 15:58.690]  Are you going to be bait?
[15:59.030 --> 15:59.670]  It's mousetrap.
[15:59.730 --> 15:59.930]  Yeah.
[16:00.310 --> 16:00.830]  I can be bait.
[16:00.830 --> 16:01.330]  I can be bait.
[16:03.230 --> 16:05.010]  But like, you got to get it.
[16:05.650 --> 16:06.530]  I don't get it.
[16:06.550 --> 16:07.070]  I'll bait him.
[16:07.390 --> 16:07.850]  I don't get it.
[16:08.110 --> 16:08.470]  Yeah, bait him.
[16:08.570 --> 16:09.150]  Get in his cone.
[16:09.490 --> 16:10.010]  OK, ready?
[16:10.270 --> 16:11.550]  I'm going to I'm going to get him in a second.
[16:11.690 --> 16:12.550]  OK, go for it.
[16:13.650 --> 16:14.990]  Why do you keep trying to trap Andrew?
[16:15.310 --> 16:16.150]  I'm not trying to.
[16:16.730 --> 16:17.130]  Get him.
[16:17.710 --> 16:18.030]  No!
[16:21.230 --> 16:21.550]  OK.
[16:22.150 --> 16:23.170]  Well, it worked pretty well.
[16:23.470 --> 16:24.230]  Aside from Andrew dying.
[16:25.850 --> 16:28.110]  I don't like that you framed that like it was my fault.
[16:28.750 --> 16:29.630]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:29.630 --> 16:30.590]  But it did work well.
[16:30.590 --> 16:31.710]  Aside from you dying.
[16:31.950 --> 16:32.070]  It did.
[16:32.370 --> 16:34.350]  Nobody assigned blame to the death.
[16:35.110 --> 16:36.810]  That was just the point where it went wrong.
[16:39.550 --> 16:41.550]  OK, we doing the same thing or what?
[16:41.790 --> 16:42.110]  Yeah, sure.
[16:42.370 --> 16:42.490]  Yeah.
[16:43.110 --> 16:44.170]  Go to the same spot I was.
[16:44.890 --> 16:46.450]  If it don't work, don't fix it.
[16:49.610 --> 16:51.290]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[16:51.890 --> 16:52.210]  I'm sorry.
[16:52.510 --> 16:52.890]  That's pretty precise.
[16:53.190 --> 16:53.710]  That's all good.
[16:54.350 --> 16:54.670]  Butt of fingers.
[16:55.410 --> 16:56.230]  Hair early.
[16:56.870 --> 16:57.410]  Butt of cage.
[17:03.880 --> 17:05.620]  That what you took me out and died.

[17:13.480 --> 17:14.900]  OK, whenever you're ready.
[17:17.180 --> 17:18.960]  Guy, I go for you, John.
[17:19.080 --> 17:19.260]  Yep.
[17:19.380 --> 17:20.020]  Dramatic draw.
[17:20.400 --> 17:20.720]  All right.
[17:20.880 --> 17:22.180]  Got BMW just texted me.
[17:22.280 --> 17:22.840]  Touch the black.
[17:23.020 --> 17:23.600]  Oh my God.
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.360]  Oh my God.
[17:24.520 --> 17:25.000]  Oh, right.
[17:25.100 --> 17:25.600]  Way to go.
[17:25.940 --> 17:27.540]  Geoff, are you looking at your phone?
[17:27.960 --> 17:30.900]  No, I was looking at Andrew with the key.
[17:30.980 --> 17:31.680]  I was watching.
[17:32.100 --> 17:35.820]  I was watching Andrew run with the key and I just fucking kept.
[17:36.300 --> 17:37.100]  Kept going forward.
[17:38.360 --> 17:41.520]  Oh, I said, watch out for the black, though.
[17:43.540 --> 17:45.360]  Wasn't that I was I was watching Andrew.
[17:45.480 --> 17:46.060]  Watch out for the black.
[17:46.420 --> 17:47.200]  Wasn't that good?
[17:47.300 --> 17:49.840]  But wasn't really nervous for a second there.
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.120]  Here we go.

[17:59.400 --> 17:59.520]  Yeah.
[18:01.020 --> 18:02.860]  Well, I don't want to let Geoff go first.
[18:03.040 --> 18:03.680]  All right.
[18:03.780 --> 18:04.820]  Let Nick go first.
[18:04.820 --> 18:07.020]  Let Gavin go first.
[18:07.040 --> 18:07.820]  See ya.
[18:12.540 --> 18:13.420]  No buncing.

[18:33.840 --> 18:35.460]  Oh, we have to keep them in like the net.
[18:35.960 --> 18:36.280]  Oh.
[18:36.280 --> 18:37.940]  How do we make the net real?
[18:38.720 --> 18:38.860]  All right.

[18:39.440 --> 18:39.740]  There we go.
[18:39.860 --> 18:40.200]  For real?
[18:42.540 --> 18:43.820]  Seems like we have to stay in position.
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.960]  Let's all let's all focus on one at a time.
[18:46.060 --> 18:46.460]  There we go.

[18:51.560 --> 18:52.440]  Let's move to the right.
[18:52.700 --> 18:53.220]  We might have to go.
[18:53.280 --> 18:53.980]  Focus on just one.
[18:54.060 --> 18:54.960]  Focus on just one.
[18:55.640 --> 18:55.980]  Nope.
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.080]  There we go.

[18:59.000 --> 19:00.020]  The one on the left.
[19:00.120 --> 19:00.740]  The one on the left.
[19:01.040 --> 19:02.560]  Seems like since nobody said anything.
[19:03.580 --> 19:03.920]  Perfect.

[19:10.720 --> 19:11.080]  Easy.
[19:12.720 --> 19:14.480]  We didn't know what we're doing for half the timer.
[19:15.620 --> 19:16.960]  We still got four of six.
[19:17.900 --> 19:20.140]  Man, people keep posting the 501 thing in the chat.
[19:20.200 --> 19:21.300]  It's really confusing me.

[19:52.560 --> 19:53.220]  We did it.
[19:55.820 --> 19:57.500]  We got a net caught in the door.
[19:59.480 --> 20:01.920]  Somebody said, this has gotten a lot more complicated since I last watched.
[20:02.160 --> 20:02.820]  No shit.
[20:03.680 --> 20:04.220]  I agree.
[20:04.500 --> 20:05.120]  This is tough.
[20:08.060 --> 20:08.820]  Night three.

[20:14.500 --> 20:15.080]  I'm gonna box.
[20:16.540 --> 20:18.520]  Oh, can we all hide under the thing?
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.420]  Yeah, but if you start moving.

[26:00.600 --> 26:04.820]  I hit x nothing's happening. Was it not me this time? I think it was wasn't it blue?
[26:05.480 --> 26:08.960]  Top left. I'm talking my head. It's always top left. It's me
[26:09.620 --> 26:10.340]  top left
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.260]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure what was cute. I don't know what's confusing about that the top left starter

[26:49.320 --> 26:53.380]  Oh go box, oh, come on, it wouldn't let me throw the box after we were spotted
[26:54.280 --> 26:55.120]  Is that true?
[26:56.100 --> 26:58.180]  Yeah. Yeah, I was daddy's box
[27:00.060 --> 27:01.280]  Way to go gavin
[27:02.740 --> 27:03.640]  Thank you
[27:08.420 --> 27:10.260]  Daddy's daddy's box again
[27:11.440 --> 27:12.360]  Here we go
[27:14.980 --> 27:17.800]  Waiting for the next cycle everyone hold right watch the black
[27:18.460 --> 27:19.500]  Go. Yep
[27:20.240 --> 27:22.920]  Clump of victory. Hang on gavin. Come back
[27:24.440 --> 27:25.680]  Hang on wait
[27:27.940 --> 27:30.420]  What is what is your problem
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.460]  Why would you leave you're not you don't have the box
[27:35.460 --> 27:39.620]  I can't leave. How can I leave if i'm in the box? Get ready
[27:39.620 --> 27:42.100]  All right, we ready? I'm ready go ready
[27:42.660 --> 27:45.140]  The only way I can leave the box is if you lift the bad box
[27:46.380 --> 27:48.760]  You have to launch it before they turn it off
[27:48.760 --> 27:49.760]  Oh boy
[27:49.760 --> 27:52.680]  I thought I did it was just off. You got it. Andrew
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.800]  But timing is just off gavin wants to be at the front of the pile so bad. It's crazy
[27:58.380 --> 28:00.620]  I don't want to be left behind again
[28:02.160 --> 28:02.560]  Hey
[28:02.560 --> 28:09.200]  See how I can't leave rotation. I said lead holiday lead lead. How could you lead a box?
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.940]  Nice I said, why do you want to leave? Hey, let's wait. No you and they turn I know what I said
[28:17.940 --> 28:20.980]  You're wrong. It's go go go play the tape play the tape
[28:20.980 --> 28:25.220]  Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let him go back. Okay, go
[28:25.940 --> 28:29.240]  No, oh, you're crazy. We're gonna die. Here we go. You're not go
[28:29.780 --> 28:32.180]  What are you doing go oh my god, we have to get a little closer
[28:34.520 --> 28:40.180]  Okay, wait till they come across and then wait, okay, wait, okay what once they turn you have to go to the right right go
[28:40.180 --> 28:44.260]  No, you killed us off the you were just a little yeah
[28:45.100 --> 28:49.940]  Little or gonna all get the key. All right daddy's box. No, no, no, no, you guys have to go down
[28:49.940 --> 28:54.200]  I have to go get the key. I think we should all get the key. I think that I think you're not leading
[28:54.200 --> 28:55.560]  I don't care what you think
[28:56.020 --> 28:58.540]  Their vision encompasses too much. Yeah, they see all
[28:59.660 --> 29:02.260]  Oh, wow, that's ballsy wait till that
[29:02.900 --> 29:04.020]  Right. Here we go
[29:07.120 --> 29:09.740]  Okay, hang on let me let me get to the top
[29:11.300 --> 29:15.540]  I know i know desperately you want to be at the top, but well, I don't know why you're doing that
[29:16.680 --> 29:17.520]  Doing what?
[29:19.960 --> 29:20.800]  All right
[29:21.400 --> 29:21.620]  Oh
[29:22.080 --> 29:26.300]  If we are going down, we have to go very low. Okay
[29:26.300 --> 29:30.700]  Yes, you guys have to go very low you want us to go different directions
[29:31.460 --> 29:37.700]  You guys are gonna go right and down as low as you can go. Okay, i'm gonna go right and get the key
[29:38.440 --> 29:40.420]  Are you ready? I'm ready
[29:42.740 --> 29:43.140]  Oh
[29:45.500 --> 29:49.720]  Like I don't know what I don't know what's confusing about what all that was
[29:49.720 --> 29:53.320]  It's not confusing. It's just we all have to wait for you. Anyway, why don't we all just go?
[29:54.580 --> 29:57.960]  Why don't we all just have the chance to get spotted by the bat?
[29:59.680 --> 30:00.920]  That's that's what you're saying
[30:00.920 --> 30:07.720]  I think four people get clear. I mean, here's the thing Gavin doesn't matter. I was right. What are we doing?
[30:08.920 --> 30:13.820]  I think Gavin's concern was that the bats also could have had a vision long enough
[30:16.340 --> 30:20.020]  Here's the thing doesn't matter I was right. Yeah. Uh, okay
[30:20.020 --> 30:22.940]  Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop. Gavin? Stop.
[30:23.720 --> 30:28.060]  Do we spread out or do we go all in one line?
[30:28.620 --> 30:35.060]  I think we should try going in one line in order so blue or orange first. Okay, okay because
[30:35.880 --> 30:40.820]  I'm worried that we're gonna get up here and we're gonna have to come back because there's gonna be like switches we have to hit
[30:40.820 --> 30:46.520]  But we can just go. Maybe. I'm worried that I won't be able to go to the left without pulling Andrew into the abyss. Yeah
[30:46.520 --> 30:48.640]  Yep, switches immediately. So that's what yeah
[30:49.380 --> 30:51.220]  That's what I was worried about. So where so
[30:52.020 --> 30:57.680]  Okay, let's line up. All right. All right. We don't die. It looks like okay. We're all gonna go up. I'm getting tugged
[30:58.340 --> 30:59.780]  Okay, take it easy
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.000]  Chill the beads. Left left. Oh
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.800]  Oh, you almost had it Geoff. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right
[31:05.800 --> 31:08.480]  This doesn't seem that hard. I I shouldn't have said that. I'm, sorry
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.360]  Oh, why why what?
[31:11.580 --> 31:15.800]  Guys, this one's actually the easy one. Just stay with the group. Just stay with the group. Stop tugging me. Stop tugging me.
[31:15.800 --> 31:18.580]  Geoff, what are you doing?
[31:19.780 --> 31:22.220]  Yeah, I hit the button. Yeah, but what if
[31:22.940 --> 31:25.100]  Yeah, but check this out. What if fuck you?
[31:26.080 --> 31:29.200]  The faster you go the easier it is on this stuff
[31:30.340 --> 31:33.180]  Is that right? Okay. All right. Here we go. The fast way
[31:33.860 --> 31:38.000]  Why am I going to the end? I'm getting tugged senseless. Why are we doing this? I'm dead
[31:38.460 --> 31:41.320]  Oh, Geoff said it's easier when you go faster. It was working for me. I lived
[31:42.220 --> 31:43.500]  That's true. Geoff did make it
[31:45.800 --> 31:46.580]  I didn't do it that time
[31:50.780 --> 31:52.480]  All right, let's try slower again
[31:55.420 --> 31:56.940]  Okay, all right, you guys want to try slower?
[31:57.140 --> 32:01.720]  I cut a corner. I cut a corner. That one. That's the first time it's been on me the whole game
[32:04.620 --> 32:07.580]  Ah, that was me. Okay, I got my switch. Oh

[32:18.120 --> 32:19.060]  All right, I got my switch

[32:29.060 --> 32:31.600]  Switch got the key ready go up up
[32:35.420 --> 32:41.460]  I like Geoff saying go up and then I feel like you're stationary keep going. I think

[32:46.580 --> 32:47.740]  We're so close
[32:47.740 --> 32:50.680]  I'm so excited for this. I'm so excited for the stats on this one. Got it

[35:35.950 --> 35:38.150]  That doesn't make any sense. What are we getting down to?
[35:38.850 --> 35:42.230]  No, because we might get we might get it right by fluke

[39:10.130 --> 39:12.410]  And have someone who's the longest at the end
[39:12.990 --> 39:15.270]  And then medium. Sorry so on and so forth
[39:17.610 --> 39:21.910]  You should probably be lower andrew, okay, remember you could jump hit it. Yeah
[39:25.550 --> 39:26.930]  Don't catch it in your ear holes
[39:27.770 --> 39:29.150]  Oh, we got jeff
[39:30.230 --> 39:31.770]  I was trying to see if I could jump it up
[39:31.770 --> 39:35.930]  You can't I think I think you just hit jump. Yeah jumps the way to do it. That's it
[39:36.830 --> 39:41.130]  Uh, uh, that was good. Okay, we might need to spread out a little bit more. Yeah, let's get spread

[40:09.460 --> 40:12.640]  No, we do not why you're jumping in the air why doesn't green ever jump
[40:13.840 --> 40:19.060]  Why would I need to jump i'm locked in I haven't i'm setting it up perfectly if he was shorter
[40:19.060 --> 40:21.520]  He could probably get some fucking height off of it
[40:22.400 --> 40:23.420]  There's a wall
[40:24.260 --> 40:25.080]  Yeah, but no

[42:28.840 --> 42:30.040]  Oh, so we're gonna
[42:34.460 --> 42:37.260]  Could you could you double so you you end up jumping
[42:39.260 --> 42:45.140]  Now you only do it once all right, so we have to stack on on on the gang off the ceiling on me
[42:45.140 --> 42:46.980]  Okay, so you drop go
[42:47.840 --> 42:48.200]  Okay
[42:49.420 --> 42:55.160]  Okay, brilliant and then you would stack there and then forward and then stack and then i'm going to make the transfer

[42:57.540 --> 42:59.600]  Oh shit, how dick you hit the button?
[43:00.500 --> 43:04.320]  I it's not he's not gonna be close enough. Yeah, you will. Well, definitely not that way. I
[43:04.700 --> 43:08.900]  No, well, let me tell you I tried to jump after yeah, I didn't I don't think you're close enough
[43:09.580 --> 43:13.820]  No, no, you you're close enough. Maybe we just need to get uh further
[43:14.580 --> 43:17.800]  Gavin thoughts, I don't know how much more spread we can do
[43:18.380 --> 43:22.060]  Yeah, I I didn't do a little bit more. I was really I think I think we can do a little more
[43:24.560 --> 43:25.500]  Gavin thoughts
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.080]  Miss the old jump there. This is gavin's kryptonite this level
[43:36.890 --> 43:38.730]  Oh, holy shit, sorry
[43:43.330 --> 43:45.710]  If you jump back on his head
[43:46.870 --> 43:49.090]  What happens if you jump under someone does it lift them?
[43:49.530 --> 43:50.410]  to the other floor
[43:51.090 --> 43:55.510]  I don't know. No land. What if nick just now now nick jump?
[43:56.170 --> 43:57.330]  Nothing. Nothing. Okay
[44:01.360 --> 44:05.140]  Okay, everybody line up now jeff you go as far to the right as you can
[44:06.680 --> 44:08.480]  Boy I can't tell shit
[44:08.480 --> 44:09.380]  All right
[44:11.520 --> 44:17.560]  We can we can start it over we can start over gavin go left gavin go left gavin go left gavin go left
[44:17.560 --> 44:18.220]  There you go
[44:18.960 --> 44:22.120]  Why all the way over it? I'll just be on the bottom now. Oh my god
[44:23.840 --> 44:29.640]  To make room for other people to do it. Oh, I think i'd already made enough room. Oh, I disagree, but that's fine
[44:30.140 --> 44:34.980]  All right. Hold on. There we go. That's all right. One more time boys. That's okay. No you guys
[44:35.500 --> 44:36.980]  No, only one. There we go
[44:37.720 --> 44:38.040]  boom
[44:39.020 --> 44:45.000]  Perfect. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. It doesn't matter go all the now how oh god you have to be like pixel perfect
[44:46.620 --> 44:46.900]  Pfft
[44:46.900 --> 44:50.600]  I don't know that I can gavin. You have to go more right just jump and try man
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.940]  I think if you even hit the jump you just try I think jeff needs to move a little
[44:55.940 --> 44:59.260]  I think I think jeff needs to go a little bit more, right? I think gavin needs to also
[45:00.680 --> 45:04.500]  Use okay. Yeah, there we go. There we go. There we go. Now. Now. Do you think if gavin goes a little more, right?
[45:04.520 --> 45:08.940]  We're still there. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think we're fine now gav. Do you think so? I think we're fine
[45:08.940 --> 45:14.780]  Hang on should I go should I do it now or should I yeah, I think you should do it now, okay
[45:15.340 --> 45:16.300]  Okay. Oh
[45:18.140 --> 45:21.720]  What happened what did that do? Oh, okay. Come on out boys
[45:23.960 --> 45:27.160]  Lovely stuff. Okay. Now before we start hitting buttons, hang on
[45:31.080 --> 45:31.960]  I think
[45:32.720 --> 45:35.500]  One I think four people need to get on this thing
[45:35.500 --> 45:41.700]  One person needs to drop to the bottom and then it's gonna come back. I have a feeling it's gonna go like left and right
[45:42.100 --> 45:46.920]  Oh, and they'll get underneath. Yeah, I think that's what's gonna happen. So andrew, do you want to stay up here?
[45:47.620 --> 45:49.480]  Sure. Well, then let's see what happens
[45:51.620 --> 45:52.340]  Three four
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.700]  Ready? Yeah, but then it's gonna stop when you go down. Oh, no one's going down. Oh
[45:58.460 --> 45:58.820]  Oh
[46:01.440 --> 46:03.980]  Maybe not. I don't think it's gonna go far enough to the left
[46:03.980 --> 46:07.060]  I think we have to do five and one person gets off. Whoops. Okay
[46:08.780 --> 46:09.220]  What
[46:10.080 --> 46:15.500]  He loves to jump as soon as it starts. We are gonna fucking run this to 501 this level
[46:16.780 --> 46:18.760]  Oh, there's no way
[46:25.070 --> 46:25.930]  Wait until
[46:31.650 --> 46:34.950]  It's really hard to tell with Andrew's hat. Yep. Yeah. Yeah
[46:37.270 --> 46:42.210]  Disadvantage for sure. Geoff needs to take a ball of hair to the right
[46:43.310 --> 46:48.410]  There we go. You think that's far enough? Yeah, I think you're good. Yeah, I think Gavin. Oh
[46:50.030 --> 46:53.450]  I was standing on nothing and I shot up to nothing. It's pretty special
[46:55.070 --> 46:55.870]  Okay, so
[46:56.690 --> 46:59.570]  Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I could drop off
[47:00.330 --> 47:00.690]  Hey
[47:01.850 --> 47:06.690]  I think we all have to be on the platform before to move. I think all five of us get on it
[47:06.690 --> 47:12.450]  We we do and then we drop one down on the red. Yeah. Yeah, I think i'll drop down because i'm on the end
[47:12.450 --> 47:16.810]  Okay, okay. Hang on. We're all gonna drop at the same time. Ready? Yeah. Wait, wait, so Andrew's dropping not me
[47:17.450 --> 47:20.370]  Yeah, i'm dropping to hit the button because i'm on the end
[47:20.370 --> 47:21.170]  All right
[47:22.510 --> 47:28.090]  The four of us at the top are gonna hit a at the same time ready three two one on three
[47:28.090 --> 47:32.910]  There we go, all right andrew you got it nice hop up
[47:34.490 --> 47:36.850]  Oh, oh, oh, oh
[47:37.650 --> 47:42.630]  We just killed them no, no, no, no. Well, yeah, we're can we make can we make this jump?
[47:43.590 --> 47:44.450]  It's the ceiling
[47:44.450 --> 47:53.050]  What has to happen is one person has to get off at the end before you hit the uh, red spikes
[47:53.390 --> 47:58.970]  And then I think the person that hit the switch when the platform comes back has to get on the underneath part
[48:00.350 --> 48:01.190]  Isn't that what we said?
[48:03.470 --> 48:06.890]  I don't know. Yeah the first time when when we didn't know about the spikes or anything. Yes
[48:13.050 --> 48:14.370]  Oh i'm so on the edge
[48:16.170 --> 48:17.430]  Okay, I think that's good. All right
[48:19.190 --> 48:20.930]  Oh, yeah, you're good. You're good
[48:24.070 --> 48:26.030]  Can we make this jump
[48:30.110 --> 48:31.390]  Okay, so
[48:32.970 --> 48:35.210]  Hang on how are we gonna do this?
[48:37.590 --> 48:43.550]  We because we have to remain four on here so i'm gonna drop down here on this thing
[48:44.490 --> 48:47.890]  then our next move is to have
[48:47.890 --> 48:53.570]  If nick is gonna go down and hit the switch you two are gonna drop from the top at the same time
[48:53.570 --> 48:58.290]  Yep. Yep. Nick is gonna walk off to the left and hit the switch. Yep when
[48:59.170 --> 49:06.810]  We get close to the end here. One of us has to go to the top. So that way this platform can come back
[49:07.290 --> 49:13.250]  Well, no the floor the floor extends once you hit the button so they can just walk across. Yeah, the ceiling comes out
[49:13.250 --> 49:16.270]  So the four of us on the platform just need to go to the roof once we pass
[49:17.190 --> 49:22.830]  Everybody jumps off at the at the wrong time. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, maybe not jump though. Well, okay nick
[49:22.830 --> 49:24.830]  Do you want to do a countdown and then i'll hit a with you?
[49:25.010 --> 49:30.490]  Well, if you want to get on the ceiling you have to jump. Yeah. Yeah. All right, three two one go
[49:30.850 --> 49:32.150]  Nick, you got it?
[49:32.370 --> 49:34.490]  Wait, jeff. Wait, jeff. Wait, jeff. Wait now
[49:40.620 --> 49:41.580]  I hit jump
[49:47.060 --> 49:50.400]  We got it all figured out we got this
[49:50.900 --> 49:52.680]  I don't think i've done that enough times to be pulling a me
[49:56.260 --> 49:59.180]  Yeah, I I mean I really I really think it's pulling to you bud
[50:03.940 --> 50:06.680]  Sorry, uh, gavin, uh, hang on andrew just needs to go. Oh
[50:09.320 --> 50:09.940]  I tried
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.820]  You're good. I was trying to make it so we'd do less. Yeah. No, I I hear you
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.620]  No, you did the right thing. I just wasn't over enough
[50:16.160 --> 50:16.480]  Yeah
[50:18.400 --> 50:19.040]  Oh shit
[50:20.460 --> 50:24.400]  Okay, what just look like eric fell before he jumped nope
[50:26.660 --> 50:27.080]  Netcode
[50:28.720 --> 50:31.600]  Netcode, okay. All right tease the tips
[50:33.500 --> 50:40.060]  Why are we so should I go a little more right? No, you're gonna go that's enough. Yeah, that's enough. Yeah
[50:44.340 --> 50:47.400]  Okay, i'm gonna go down and hit the switch this time
[50:48.180 --> 50:48.540]  Okay
[50:52.260 --> 50:57.000]  Okay, did you count down eric? Yep. Okay, three two one go
[51:01.860 --> 51:05.640]  Nice good work boys. Okay now level now level off. There you go
