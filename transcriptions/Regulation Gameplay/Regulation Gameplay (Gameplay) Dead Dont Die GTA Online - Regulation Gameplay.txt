[00:00.000 --> 00:01.080]  What are we doing, Geoff?
[00:01.320 --> 00:05.540]  Today, Nick, we are playing Grand Theft Auto 5.
[00:05.680 --> 00:07.620]  We're doing a thing that you told us about.
[00:07.920 --> 00:08.200]  Wow.
[00:08.420 --> 00:13.020]  There's some sort of a Halloween themed minigame going on in the cemetery.
[00:13.300 --> 00:14.640]  It's really all I know.
[00:15.180 --> 00:15.900]  Maybe you could elaborate.
[00:16.300 --> 00:16.820]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16.900 --> 00:20.060]  It looks like it's surviving waves after waves of zombies,
[00:20.060 --> 00:21.220]  but it's not just zombies.
[00:21.260 --> 00:23.720]  There's some little surprises in there, too.
[00:23.940 --> 00:25.360]  But I don't want to spoil them for you yet.
[00:25.520 --> 00:26.640]  Are you? Why?
[00:27.140 --> 00:29.280]  Why are you saying you're saying it
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.720]  like you're selling us on it?
[00:31.240 --> 00:32.620]  Surprise! Zombies are real.
[00:32.740 --> 00:34.120]  Also, that's not the surprise.
[00:34.860 --> 00:37.320]  Yeah, you yeah, I thought the zombies were the surprise,
[00:37.500 --> 00:41.320]  but the surprise is it's like it's like watching an E3 presentation.
[00:41.360 --> 00:44.700]  It's like, honestly, it's the most Nintendo ass way
[00:44.700 --> 00:46.260]  you could have presented what you were just saying.
[00:46.540 --> 00:48.240]  Wow. The future is storage.
[00:48.620 --> 00:52.400]  One day we should record a Let's Play where we act like the people on stage at E3.
[00:52.600 --> 00:53.900]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.440]  I had a fun idea for a Let's Play earlier today, and I forgot it.
[01:02.580 --> 01:03.460]  You guys have to be careful.
[01:03.660 --> 01:05.680]  There's helicopters around here.
[01:05.840 --> 01:06.700]  They try to get you.
[01:06.940 --> 01:08.660]  Oh, I was just in one and something happened.
[01:08.900 --> 01:10.280]  Hey, Gav, hop in.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.620]  Oh, open that woman's door.
[01:12.840 --> 01:13.960]  Oh, nice limb.
[01:14.860 --> 01:18.320]  Yeah, it's got a little extra little surprise on the back.
[01:19.600 --> 01:20.660]  It's a little top heavy.
[01:22.180 --> 01:23.480]  Let's see if you can get up in that.
[01:23.480 --> 01:26.680]  I don't know you guys got to be careful.
[01:26.800 --> 01:27.320]  The cops are coming.
[01:28.740 --> 01:29.460]  Oh, hello.
[01:30.420 --> 01:30.780]  Hello.
[01:31.240 --> 01:33.840]  I'm going to watch out today.
[01:34.460 --> 01:35.660]  You run into buddy.
[01:36.080 --> 01:36.480]  Here we go.
[01:36.560 --> 01:37.580]  Fight fights back.
[01:38.340 --> 01:38.820]  All right.
[01:38.860 --> 01:40.040]  How do I get up in the brick?
[01:40.320 --> 01:41.300]  Here we go.
[01:41.400 --> 01:42.580]  Oh, yeah, there we go.
[01:44.640 --> 01:45.620]  Let's go find Eric.
[01:45.860 --> 01:46.280]  Yeah, guys.
[01:46.320 --> 01:46.480]  Fight.
[01:46.540 --> 01:46.680]  Help.
[01:46.780 --> 01:47.580]  Come find Eric.
[01:48.640 --> 01:51.000]  Yeah, maybe Eric will have an accident like I had in my helicopter.
[01:51.000 --> 01:52.760]  There's a bunch of cops around here.
[01:54.760 --> 01:55.140]  Why?
[01:56.140 --> 01:56.740]  Better watch out.
[01:56.860 --> 01:57.660]  I don't know.
[01:57.820 --> 01:58.620]  Geoff, go back around.
[01:58.720 --> 01:59.200]  What did you do?
[01:59.320 --> 01:59.480]  Yeah.
[02:01.220 --> 02:03.240]  I just I was protecting us from helicopters.
[02:07.620 --> 02:08.380]  What's happening?
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.280]  Get over this.
[02:11.400 --> 02:13.360]  Why aren't the police doing anything to help?
[02:14.700 --> 02:15.640]  Hey, Eric, what's up?
[02:15.840 --> 02:16.180]  Eric, you alright?
[02:16.940 --> 02:17.320]  Eric.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.940]  The police aren't doing anything to help me.
[02:20.160 --> 02:21.880]  I got nicked in the crossfire there a little bit.
[02:22.020 --> 02:22.300]  I'll be honest.
[02:22.300 --> 02:27.140]  I forgot I own the turret of limo.
[02:27.200 --> 02:27.940]  This is awesome.
[02:28.320 --> 02:29.920]  This is a pretty great vehicle.
[02:30.500 --> 02:33.000]  Can I tell you how in handy that would have been?
[02:34.160 --> 02:35.260]  How in handy?
[02:35.620 --> 02:37.940]  Yeah, get him, Geoff.
[02:38.020 --> 02:38.420]  Get him.
[02:38.940 --> 02:39.840]  I deserve it.
[02:39.920 --> 02:40.500]  I deserve it.
[02:42.080 --> 02:43.560]  Alright, should we kill some zombies?
[02:44.260 --> 02:44.620]  Yeah.
[02:45.120 --> 02:45.780]  Are these not zombies?
[02:46.420 --> 02:48.480]  Now that we just turned all these cops into zombies.
[02:48.720 --> 02:49.080]  Oh, no.
[02:50.320 --> 02:51.040]  Alright, let's do it.
[02:51.040 --> 02:53.320]  I can jump in the instance of the game.
[02:53.640 --> 02:55.400]  Yeah, we can see if it starts it.
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.800]  Do it while we're still alive.
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.700]  I don't know that we're going to make...
[03:00.700 --> 03:01.180]  There we go.
[03:01.400 --> 03:02.080]  There we go.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.000]  Don't shoot me.
[03:03.100 --> 03:03.440]  Come on.
[03:05.080 --> 03:06.100]  Okay, ready to go.
[03:06.460 --> 03:08.500]  I recommend filling your ammo.
[03:09.060 --> 03:10.000]  You're going to need it.
[03:10.780 --> 03:12.820]  Oh, you've already done a little bit of dabbling, have you, Nick?
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.320]  A little bit.
[03:13.380 --> 03:14.180]  I had to test the game time.
[03:14.180 --> 03:15.440]  What weapons are my starting with?
[03:15.520 --> 03:16.700]  Special carbine.
[03:17.540 --> 03:18.260]  Service carbine.
[03:18.900 --> 03:19.720]  Might do the bull...
[03:20.360 --> 03:21.040]  The bullpup.
[03:21.180 --> 03:23.920]  I wonder if you're going to have to get really close.
[03:24.620 --> 03:27.860]  I mean, I'm starting with the minigun because I was rotating through.
[03:28.600 --> 03:29.460]  What are you, Gavin?
[03:30.540 --> 03:32.280]  Minigun's not great if you need cover.
[03:34.620 --> 03:35.300]  Oh, goddammit.
[03:35.360 --> 03:36.580]  Although for zombies, do you need cover?
[03:37.040 --> 03:37.360]  Nah.
[03:38.160 --> 03:39.220]  Looks like Gavin's got one too.
[03:39.320 --> 03:40.520]  Well, I love the minigun.
[03:40.640 --> 03:42.240]  Yeah, this is the way Gavin plays.
[03:43.640 --> 03:45.420]  So, should we stick together or spread out?
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.840]  We'll probably stick together.
[03:47.020 --> 03:50.240]  Why don't we stand in a square, all facing outwards?
[03:50.240 --> 03:50.600]  Oh, guys!
[03:51.040 --> 03:52.740]  Guys, we're in North Yankton.
[03:52.780 --> 03:53.540]  Yeah, we're yanking.
[03:55.420 --> 03:57.980]  Oh, this is where, uh...
[03:58.880 --> 03:59.480]  What's that?
[03:59.760 --> 04:01.120]  It's where Brad got buried, I think.
[04:02.180 --> 04:05.420]  Yeah, this is where the alien Easter egg is.
[04:05.780 --> 04:06.180]  Oh, really?
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.180]  Not in here, but in North Yankton.
[04:08.200 --> 04:09.520]  Dude, it's like Undead Nightmare.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.620]  It is.
[04:10.660 --> 04:11.280]  It is, yeah.
[04:11.680 --> 04:14.240]  Do we need to worry about headshots or anything, or is it just...
[04:14.240 --> 04:16.640]  They're easier to kill with headshots, yes.
[04:16.680 --> 04:17.920]  Okay, so it is like Undead Nightmare.
[04:19.020 --> 04:20.760]  But you don't have to shoot them in the head.
[04:21.340 --> 04:22.560]  You can collect weapons.
[04:22.960 --> 04:23.020]  Yeah.
[04:23.260 --> 04:25.680]  By removing the head, we're destroying the brain.
[04:26.460 --> 04:28.840]  By removing the head, we're destroying the brain.
[04:29.840 --> 04:32.520]  I love that guy's like a real... or was a real newscaster.
[04:33.520 --> 04:35.720]  From 28... or no, from Shaun of the Dead?
[04:35.960 --> 04:36.180]  Yeah.
[04:39.100 --> 04:39.760]  That's awesome.
[04:40.620 --> 04:43.500]  So, when we were sticking together, Geoff, you just like, like looking around?
[04:43.500 --> 04:45.760]  I just ran up and got a... I just went up and got a Molotov.
[04:45.820 --> 04:45.980]  Okay.
[04:46.520 --> 04:47.040]  Just came back.
[04:48.060 --> 04:50.880]  I keep seeing... I don't know if you've noticed, but there's stuff you can pick up.
[04:54.120 --> 04:54.960]  Picking up stuff.
[04:55.280 --> 04:58.360]  Man, the... the audio for this is great.
[04:58.480 --> 05:00.080]  Like, you can hear where they're coming from.
[05:01.000 --> 05:01.360]  Oh.
[05:02.300 --> 05:04.420]  I think my headphones are on backwards. That doesn't help me.
[05:04.840 --> 05:05.200]  Okay.
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.080]  Alright, then do opposites.
[05:07.240 --> 05:09.480]  I might recommend that you fix it.
[05:10.460 --> 05:12.160]  That seems like a fixable one.
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.660]  It's a long-standing thing I had with Gus. Now I just... do it to remind me of Gus.
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.040]  Wait, there's a...
[05:18.620 --> 05:20.120]  It's the only way to remember Gus.
[05:20.520 --> 05:20.620]  Alright.
[05:21.660 --> 05:22.140]  We got it.
[05:22.160 --> 05:23.280]  Hell yeah! Look at that.
[05:23.360 --> 05:24.060]  Cool. Way to go, boys.
[05:24.560 --> 05:26.280]  Did we record with Gus this week, Eric?
[05:26.460 --> 05:26.640]  No.
[05:26.640 --> 05:27.220]  We didn't, did we?
[05:27.340 --> 05:27.540]  No.
[05:27.840 --> 05:29.820]  Was that for any reason? Was he out of town or something?
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.620]  No, I'm too slammed.
[05:31.680 --> 05:32.460]  Too busy? Okay.
[05:33.260 --> 05:35.420]  I just realized today is usually the day we do it.
[05:35.540 --> 05:37.640]  I'm back and trying to get back in the swing of things.
[05:37.840 --> 05:40.940]  And, like, it was... overwhelming.
[05:40.940 --> 05:42.740]  I did not sleep well last night.
[05:43.500 --> 05:44.660]  I slept like shit.
[05:44.660 --> 05:46.280]  Dude, I didn't sleep last well night.
[05:46.560 --> 05:48.500]  I didn't sleep last night. What is going on?
[05:48.620 --> 05:49.400]  I don't know. Are you okay?
[05:50.040 --> 05:51.860]  That's it, but... well, he didn't sleep last night.
[05:52.280 --> 05:52.720]  It's...
[05:52.720 --> 05:53.360]  Oh, a big pig!
[05:53.780 --> 05:55.020]  Are those... is that...
[05:55.020 --> 05:55.960]  Is this a zombie pig?
[05:56.300 --> 05:57.820]  See? That's the surprise!
[05:58.040 --> 05:59.220]  It's a zom-boar.
[05:59.600 --> 06:00.500]  Oh, wow.
[06:00.660 --> 06:01.020]  Zom-boar.
[06:01.020 --> 06:03.220]  Is that one of the classic Nick surprises?
[06:03.820 --> 06:05.140]  Well, yeah, that's an...
[06:05.140 --> 06:06.540]  That was cheeky.
[06:06.660 --> 06:08.580]  That's one of those Nick-tendo surprises.
[06:08.860 --> 06:09.280]  Wow!
[06:11.240 --> 06:12.800]  Hey, Nick, how did you sleep last night?
[06:12.920 --> 06:13.300]  Not good.
[06:13.700 --> 06:14.120]  Not good.
[06:14.480 --> 06:15.340]  You haven't tossed and turned.
[06:16.040 --> 06:17.840]  So the four of us all slept like shit last night.
[06:17.880 --> 06:18.140]  Oh, yeah.
[06:18.360 --> 06:19.400]  We're all a bit zombie.
[06:20.120 --> 06:20.540]  Oh, yeah.
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.380]  You know what else is weird is I sleep great every night.
[06:23.740 --> 06:25.940]  Last night was so weird that I didn't sleep well.
[06:26.040 --> 06:27.780]  I just... I just kept waking up.
[06:27.860 --> 06:30.760]  I just kept waking up and waking up and waking up and waking up.
[06:30.900 --> 06:32.520]  Yeah, I tossed and turned a lot.
[06:32.700 --> 06:32.780]  Yeah.
[06:32.940 --> 06:33.660]  Yeah, same.
[06:33.760 --> 06:36.220]  I'm just... I was just really stressed about work stuff for the other one.
[06:37.400 --> 06:38.120]  I'm also...
[06:38.120 --> 06:38.980]  Don't worry about the other one.
[06:39.480 --> 06:40.460]  I don't have a choice.
[06:41.240 --> 06:43.600]  What one person has to worry about the other one?
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.740]  Hey, it's okay.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  You can confide in us.
[06:46.040 --> 06:47.680]  What's stressing you out about the other one, man?
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.560]  Let's see.
[06:48.680 --> 06:49.000]  Zombie coyote!
[06:50.720 --> 06:53.140]  It was just putting the merch on sale and everything.
[06:53.260 --> 06:55.220]  We're trying to do like a launch for the merch.
[06:55.460 --> 06:59.820]  And I'm just, you know, based on past experiences working at Rooster Teeth.
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.740]  Timed stuff is harder than you think.
[07:03.160 --> 07:04.340]  Oh, Eric, just don't launch it early.
[07:04.640 --> 07:04.760]  Yeah.
[07:05.820 --> 07:06.860]  So it's just that.
[07:06.980 --> 07:07.860]  I was just really...
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.480]  Did you do the launch already?
[07:10.660 --> 07:10.960]  Did it go well?
[07:10.960 --> 07:11.240]  No, no.
[07:11.300 --> 07:12.020]  It's tomorrow.
[07:12.340 --> 07:13.040]  That's why I was...
[07:13.040 --> 07:13.260]  Oh, okay.
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.080]  That's why I didn't sleep well.
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.240]  Well, I hope you sleep well tonight.
[07:16.340 --> 07:18.140]  You're gonna need it tomorrow to fix all the mistakes.
[07:19.820 --> 07:21.160]  I think everything's set.
[07:21.260 --> 07:24.040]  It's just when you think everything's set and then it's not and you go,
[07:24.160 --> 07:25.180]  Ah, I'm in hell.
[07:25.180 --> 07:25.820]  I missed this.
[07:25.820 --> 07:26.360]  My own making.
[07:27.040 --> 07:27.220]  Yeah.
[07:27.780 --> 07:29.280]  Watch out for possessed coyotes.
[07:29.760 --> 07:32.100]  I just had to pee all night and I refused to get up.
[07:33.260 --> 07:33.620]  Dude.
[07:34.440 --> 07:35.960]  Wait till you hit 49.
[07:36.560 --> 07:37.700]  Oh, armor, armor, armor.
[07:37.700 --> 07:38.100]  Oh, yeah.
[07:39.020 --> 07:39.960]  Don't try to shoot me.
[07:40.800 --> 07:41.440]  Oh, hello.
[07:41.540 --> 07:43.840]  I took a shot at Nick, but I missed, luckily.
[07:45.340 --> 07:47.300]  Well, you would have missed out on all my surprises.
[07:49.980 --> 07:51.260]  There's a zombie that got past me.
[07:54.300 --> 07:55.460]  I hear, I do not see.
[07:56.040 --> 07:56.420]  You do a good one.
[07:56.420 --> 07:57.280]  Here they come, here they come.
[07:58.020 --> 07:59.520]  There's a health pack right behind you if you need it.
[08:00.220 --> 08:01.500]  Oh, the minigun feels...
[08:01.500 --> 08:02.100]  I didn't shoot you.
[08:02.200 --> 08:03.620]  The minigun feels like cheating a little bit.
[08:04.220 --> 08:05.060]  It does, dude.
[08:05.060 --> 08:05.340]  I feel...
[08:05.340 --> 08:06.260]  It really does.
[08:06.260 --> 08:08.340]  I feel pretty good about this carvine.
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.060]  Like, I'm...
[08:09.540 --> 08:10.780]  I'm really, like, laying it in.
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.580]  I mean, you have all your guns.
[08:12.760 --> 08:13.900]  It's just the one you...
[08:13.900 --> 08:14.240]  You just...
[08:14.240 --> 08:14.860]  Oh, shit!
[08:17.020 --> 08:17.720]  Oh, they're coming.
[08:17.860 --> 08:18.960]  They're coming from everywhere here.
[08:19.140 --> 08:20.180]  Hey, they start popping up.
[08:20.320 --> 08:21.180]  Okay, you're good, you're good.
[08:21.700 --> 08:22.420]  Oh, they're running.
[08:23.800 --> 08:24.600]  Oh, it's a fire one.
[08:24.940 --> 08:25.480]  Oh, he blew.
[08:26.740 --> 08:27.680]  Did he explode?
[08:28.140 --> 08:28.800]  Yeah, he's on fire.
[08:29.260 --> 08:30.300]  The blue ones blow up.
[08:31.900 --> 08:32.980]  The fire ones fire.
[08:33.080 --> 08:34.120]  They're coming from Nick's side there.
[08:37.180 --> 08:38.520]  Is that fire for good now?
[08:40.500 --> 08:41.200]  Yeah, that's good fire.
[08:41.700 --> 08:42.800]  We claim the fire.
[08:42.900 --> 08:43.520]  We own the fire.
[08:44.660 --> 08:45.040]  That's right.
[08:45.080 --> 08:45.680]  We own the night.
[08:46.200 --> 08:47.500]  Zombies start on fire.
[08:48.180 --> 08:49.100]  Somebody dropped something.
[08:49.220 --> 08:49.560]  What'd they drop?
[08:49.920 --> 08:50.820]  Was it some zombie money?
[08:50.940 --> 08:51.260]  Was that a grenade?
[08:52.380 --> 08:53.220]  Got some bucks.
[08:54.300 --> 08:55.220]  No, I wanted the grenade.
[08:56.380 --> 08:57.360]  It'll be there when you get back.
[08:57.860 --> 08:58.580]  This is...
[08:58.580 --> 08:59.140]  I like this.
[08:59.300 --> 08:59.420]  This is...
[08:59.420 --> 08:59.920]  I do too!
[09:02.860 --> 09:04.040]  I'm really on a GTA kick.
[09:05.060 --> 09:05.600]  Dude, me too.
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.120]  And I...
[09:08.220 --> 09:08.720]  I'm just...
[09:08.720 --> 09:09.740]  I'm just really enjoying it.
[09:09.860 --> 09:12.280]  All Eric's wanted to do for the last two months is play GTA.
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.380]  That's it, dude.
[09:13.520 --> 09:14.000]  That's all I wanted to do.
[09:14.620 --> 09:16.260]  I gotta say, when we were...
[09:16.260 --> 09:20.420]  When I was fucking around in it yesterday, trying to figure out what we were gonna play, and...
[09:20.420 --> 09:23.680]  I was trying to understand what this new career progression thing is.
[09:23.720 --> 09:26.660]  The more I looked at it, the more I kind of want to do it all.
[09:27.060 --> 09:27.760]  Yeah, I just...
[09:27.760 --> 09:29.280]  I don't understand it, and I don't want to learn.
[09:29.780 --> 09:31.760]  There's like achievements that are built into all of it.
[09:31.800 --> 09:35.140]  It's basically just a way to thread all the free DLCs together.
[09:35.620 --> 09:37.380]  And game types to make sure you do them.
[09:37.680 --> 09:38.040]  I...
[09:38.040 --> 09:41.220]  I want you to learn all about it, and then bring it to us.
[09:41.660 --> 09:43.480]  And then go, here's what we're doing.
[09:43.680 --> 09:44.260]  And then I go, great.
[09:44.260 --> 09:45.180]  I feel like I understand it.
[09:45.280 --> 09:45.660]  It just...
[09:45.660 --> 09:47.440]  It just seems like there's a never-ending...
[09:47.440 --> 09:49.360]  Like, taking five or six years off of this game.
[09:50.460 --> 09:51.080]  And it...
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.040]  Not taking years off.
[09:52.400 --> 09:53.180]  This guy's hard.
[09:53.360 --> 09:53.720]  Jeez.
[09:53.900 --> 09:56.240]  Has produced a shitload of content to play.
[09:58.340 --> 09:59.480]  Oh, did you have an armored one?
[10:00.220 --> 10:02.020]  Yeah, he didn't want to go down.
[10:02.020 --> 10:05.280]  Well, that's his choice.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.220]  Oh, behind, behind, behind!
[10:08.440 --> 10:08.820]  Oh, yeah?
[10:09.040 --> 10:09.180]  Oh.
[10:09.920 --> 10:10.480]  I gotcha.
[10:10.600 --> 10:10.940]  I gotcha.
[10:11.020 --> 10:11.180]  I gotcha.
[10:11.200 --> 10:11.340]  Thank you.
[10:11.400 --> 10:11.540]  Thank you.
[10:11.580 --> 10:11.720]  Thank you.
[10:11.720 --> 10:12.500]  Thank you.
[10:13.380 --> 10:13.760]  All right.
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.800]  What if we do, like, Nick and I facing this way?
[10:15.800 --> 10:16.460]  Because I have a...
[10:16.460 --> 10:17.660]  With a minigun and a regular.
[10:17.960 --> 10:18.540]  Oh, oh shit!
[10:18.540 --> 10:18.800]  Right!
[10:18.820 --> 10:19.600]  Well, I think...
[10:19.600 --> 10:21.620]  I think it's gonna get really overwhelming really fast.
[10:21.680 --> 10:22.380]  If we just try...
[10:22.380 --> 10:23.780]  If you try to pick one side.
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.560]  I think you can...
[10:24.560 --> 10:24.740]  Okay.
[10:25.040 --> 10:26.140]  I think you can, like, lead in the direction.
[10:26.140 --> 10:26.280]  Oh shit!
[10:26.500 --> 10:27.080]  Oh shit!
[10:27.120 --> 10:27.440]  On fire!
[10:27.620 --> 10:28.060]  I'm on fire!
[10:28.060 --> 10:28.500]  I'm on fire!
[10:28.500 --> 10:29.040]  I'm on fire!
[10:31.720 --> 10:32.080]  Oh!
[10:32.300 --> 10:32.800]  Dude, you can...
[10:32.800 --> 10:33.060]  Oh!
[10:33.060 --> 10:34.260]  You can shoot these graves.
[10:34.360 --> 10:34.820]  That's awesome.
[10:36.680 --> 10:37.940]  Nick, do you need the, uh, help?
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.280]  Oh, yeah.
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.040]  Well, you better come get it, bud.
[10:40.440 --> 10:41.300]  Oh, not time.
[10:42.920 --> 10:44.320]  Why am I wearing a pilot helmet?
[10:46.660 --> 10:48.060]  I don't wanna breathe these zombies.
[10:49.500 --> 10:50.900]  Yeah, it's just a precaution.
[10:52.180 --> 10:53.760]  Just take a sip of this coffee here.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.480]  Don't know why I'm not sleeping well.
[10:58.340 --> 10:59.960]  When's your last coffee of the day?
[11:00.940 --> 11:01.960]  Uh, lately it's at noon.
[11:03.040 --> 11:03.720]  Oh, noon's not bad.
[11:03.880 --> 11:04.060]  Four?
[11:04.120 --> 11:04.600]  Four is pretty nice.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.500]  It used to be four for me.
[11:07.340 --> 11:08.300]  Yeah, that's about when I'm done.
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.080]  I have a nice coffee in the afternoon somewhere.
[11:11.400 --> 11:12.100]  Oh, it's nice.
[11:12.720 --> 11:13.260]  When's your last...
[11:13.260 --> 11:13.380]  You're up to the right.
[11:13.440 --> 11:13.900]  Oh, there they are.
[11:14.200 --> 11:15.520]  When's your last cigarette of the day?
[11:16.280 --> 11:17.020]  Oh, God.
[11:17.440 --> 11:17.760]  Uh...
[11:17.760 --> 11:18.000]  Midnight?
[11:18.540 --> 11:18.780]  Yeah.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.260]  When does the day end and begin?
[11:21.780 --> 11:22.100]  Ah!
[11:23.340 --> 11:23.920]  It's okay.
[11:25.020 --> 11:25.460]  It's okay.
[11:28.800 --> 11:30.420]  It's a very big gun here.
[11:30.900 --> 11:32.220]  When's your last bump of the day?
[11:34.500 --> 11:36.480]  You just keep doing it. The day doesn't end, buddy.
[11:36.780 --> 11:37.540]  Is that a deer?
[11:38.140 --> 11:40.100]  I think I killed someone with antlers.
[11:40.720 --> 11:41.000]  Cool.
[11:41.460 --> 11:42.360]  Yeah, there's a zombie deer.
[11:42.540 --> 11:43.320]  That's another surprise.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.340]  Classic Nintendo surprise.
[11:47.940 --> 11:48.740]  That's me, baby.
[11:50.020 --> 11:52.600]  Alright, so this is a get-yourself-against-the-wall kind of game.
[11:52.720 --> 11:54.800]  Yeah, I'm definitely a...
[11:54.800 --> 11:55.440]  I'm, like, trying to get myself against the wall.
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.380]  I'm trying to look, like, left and right to, like, where you guys are and where me and Gavin are just to keep popping them.
[12:00.660 --> 12:01.040]  How's your ammo?
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.280]  There's one coming out on the right, but...
[12:02.280 --> 12:02.940]  Yeah, I see that.
[12:03.080 --> 12:03.480]  I'm trying to...
[12:03.480 --> 12:03.740]  They have to get over a wall.
[12:03.740 --> 12:05.600]  I'm knocking them down, but they're not dying.
[12:05.700 --> 12:07.200]  I'm just knocking... I'm only knocking.
[12:08.480 --> 12:09.440]  There's no more room in hell.
[12:09.800 --> 12:10.760]  Zombies, they get stronger.
[12:10.860 --> 12:11.380]  Yeah, definitely.
[12:14.400 --> 12:15.400]  Oh, explodey boy!
[12:16.260 --> 12:16.620]  Ow!
[12:18.360 --> 12:21.540]  I'm almost out of that minigun. I'm down to 4,000 bullets.
[12:22.620 --> 12:22.980]  Damn.
[12:24.060 --> 12:24.420]  Careful.
[12:24.960 --> 12:26.460]  I am almost out of ammo, too.
[12:26.740 --> 12:27.760]  Do you think there's a werewolf?
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.180]  I only had nine kills. I knocked down a lot of guys without killing them.
[12:31.260 --> 12:32.720]  I'm gonna start aiming for the head.
[12:33.920 --> 12:37.560]  I think the minigun's a good choice. It doesn't seem... It doesn't ever knock anyone down. It just...
[12:37.560 --> 12:39.060]  It just... It just puts a bullet in the room.
[12:39.080 --> 12:42.420]  It seems to... It seems to one-shot everybody, no matter where you shoot.
[12:42.460 --> 12:44.720]  Yeah. I'm getting a lot of dick and chest shots.
[12:45.340 --> 12:45.740]  If you...
[12:45.740 --> 12:46.620]  Oh, I got an award. Death Trap.
[12:47.300 --> 12:48.360]  Because I don't think I have that.
[12:49.940 --> 12:51.900]  Yeah, I only got... I got... It took me...
[12:51.900 --> 12:55.000]  Because I only played in content, I think it took me eight years to unlock the minigun.
[12:55.460 --> 12:55.720]  Jesus.
[12:55.720 --> 12:59.260]  I think you gotta get to level 120 or something for the minigun, right?
[12:59.340 --> 13:00.660]  Like, it's a... It's a slog.
[13:01.160 --> 13:04.460]  Do you remember when I got the achievement for hitting level 100 when I was level 41?
[13:04.760 --> 13:06.000]  Yes. I was so mad at you.
[13:06.520 --> 13:06.900]  What? Why?
[13:07.580 --> 13:08.280]  How did that happen?
[13:08.280 --> 13:10.100]  The game just shat me out a ton of achievements.
[13:10.900 --> 13:12.620]  Hey, Nick. Nick, they're coming up behind you.
[13:13.060 --> 13:13.940]  Oh, are they? Oh, you got them.
[13:14.500 --> 13:15.300]  Fire guy. Fire guy.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.780]  Yeah, I got him. I got him.
[13:17.060 --> 13:20.660]  You just keep focusing on your... You keep focusing on that stairwell, Nick. I got you guys coming up behind me.
[13:21.600 --> 13:23.120]  I got 7,000 rounds and...
[13:24.740 --> 13:26.380]  All I want to do is shoot them.
[13:26.580 --> 13:27.380]  Oh, what the hell is that?
[13:27.740 --> 13:29.960]  It looks like I farted. It looks like I farted. I didn't do it.
[13:30.080 --> 13:31.100]  Why am I... Am I farting? What's happening?
[13:31.920 --> 13:32.920]  It is a...
[13:34.200 --> 13:36.040]  It's just a stench where we stood.
[13:36.960 --> 13:39.200]  Why am I... Why is there a stand stench? What is that?
[13:39.660 --> 13:41.360]  I think it wants to keep you from...
[13:41.360 --> 13:41.480]  Oh, balls.
[13:42.400 --> 13:43.200]  I'm being overwhelmed.
[13:43.280 --> 13:43.860]  No safe spaces.
[13:43.880 --> 13:44.840]  I got you. I got you. I got you.
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.120]  Okay, thank you.
[13:47.360 --> 13:47.680]  Alright.
[13:48.300 --> 13:50.460]  I can't believe it shot me out of my stench.
[13:50.460 --> 13:51.620]  Get out of here, you little son of a bitch.
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.640]  I might have to switch off the minigun now.
[13:54.020 --> 13:54.520]  Run, Eric. I got you.
[13:54.900 --> 13:55.420]  Thank you.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.080]  Oh, oh, there's like a shaman over here.
[14:00.200 --> 14:01.120]  Oh, kill the shaman.
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.120]  I got him. I got him.
[14:02.380 --> 14:04.000]  I knocked him down. I don't think he's dead.
[14:04.420 --> 14:06.280]  Is this fucking Destiny 2 all of a sudden?
[14:06.340 --> 14:06.620]  Got him.
[14:07.220 --> 14:08.920]  Yeah, is there like a wizard on the moon or what?
[14:09.040 --> 14:10.020]  Is this space magic?
[14:10.780 --> 14:15.080]  So that's what we have to do. So when that happens, you got to be careful. There's a shaman around.
[14:15.840 --> 14:18.320]  Can't believe they put a wiz on the moon.
[14:18.780 --> 14:18.980]  Ah!
[14:21.020 --> 14:22.380]  Oh shit, right behind us.
[14:24.480 --> 14:25.660]  Oh, that guy's not dead.
[14:26.860 --> 14:27.220]  Reloading.
[14:27.520 --> 14:28.100]  Do you die now?
[14:28.240 --> 14:28.400]  Okay.
[14:30.520 --> 14:33.440]  Okay, they definitely take more than one shot now.
[14:33.480 --> 14:35.100]  This is getting intense. Now I'm worried.
[14:35.840 --> 14:36.540]  Why are you worried?
[14:37.240 --> 14:39.180]  Well, I got hit a little bit there.
[14:39.520 --> 14:41.200]  Are you going to grab that carbine, Nick?
[14:41.560 --> 14:42.960]  Yeah, I'm going to go grab it.
[14:42.980 --> 14:43.300]  Cool, making sure.
[14:43.560 --> 14:44.000]  Thank you.
[14:44.820 --> 14:47.080]  Are they going to put stink pots in this round as well?
[14:47.500 --> 14:51.140]  Yeah, but we just have to find the guy that starts doing it.
[14:51.260 --> 14:52.720]  So we just got to get a little more mobile.
[14:53.340 --> 14:54.880]  It's a deer shaman this time.
[14:55.680 --> 14:59.320]  I think you got it. Gavin, I think you're good where you are. It feels like your system's working.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.400]  It is for the next thousand bullets and then I'm screwed.
[15:02.940 --> 15:03.660]  Behind us, Geoff.
[15:04.940 --> 15:05.620]  The deer!
[15:07.040 --> 15:08.200]  I told you it's a deer shaman.
[15:10.180 --> 15:10.900]  Oh god!
[15:11.020 --> 15:12.180]  Holy shitballs.
[15:12.460 --> 15:13.240]  Oh my god.
[15:13.420 --> 15:14.220]  Oh, the deer was...
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.180]  Oh, another one!
[15:15.560 --> 15:16.640]  I didn't even see him until he attacked me.
[15:16.640 --> 15:17.800]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[15:17.840 --> 15:18.540]  The other one, number two.
[15:18.860 --> 15:19.500]  Oh, Geoff, look out!
[15:21.740 --> 15:23.640]  The zombies just stood still for a minute.
[15:23.980 --> 15:24.380]  I got you, bud.
[15:25.240 --> 15:25.740]  Oh, thanks.
[15:27.560 --> 15:30.820]  I think aiming at the head is really going to be crucial.
[15:37.020 --> 15:37.660]  Die, Explodoman.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.380]  Shaman somewhere, I think.
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.480]  Oh, I'm out.
[15:48.020 --> 15:48.620]  Time to switch.
[15:49.200 --> 15:50.180]  What the hell?
[15:51.100 --> 15:51.820]  What just happened?
[15:52.420 --> 15:52.620]  What?
[15:53.160 --> 15:53.580]  What is it?
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.440]  I couldn't shoot.
[15:54.940 --> 15:55.420]  Oh, balls!
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.200]  Oh, if you get too close to certain walls, it won't let you shoot for some reason.
[15:59.200 --> 16:00.480]  Get out of here, bastard.
[16:02.460 --> 16:03.740]  I got you, I got you, I got you.
[16:04.120 --> 16:05.020]  I got you, Geoff.
[16:06.660 --> 16:07.580]  Oh, that guy dropped money.
[16:08.820 --> 16:09.800]  Yeah, sometimes they do.
[16:12.000 --> 16:12.360]  Rips them off.
[16:12.940 --> 16:15.220]  Who's burying these guys with cash in their pockets?
[16:15.680 --> 16:17.000]  I missed my minigun, I'll be honest.
[16:17.960 --> 16:19.800]  I missed when you had a minigun, too.
[16:19.960 --> 16:21.900]  Got a couple of flaming zombies.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.040]  Oh, fuck.
[16:27.080 --> 16:28.720]  Come on, fuck.
[16:33.520 --> 16:35.240]  Are you guys okay over there?
[16:35.280 --> 16:35.800]  No!
[16:40.060 --> 16:40.720]  Got him.
[16:43.300 --> 16:50.520]  So, the zombie that's on fire can catch other zombies on fire, and then you have to find the initial one, I think.
[16:50.760 --> 16:53.280]  Wow, Gavin dropped way in the killing rankings there.
[16:56.480 --> 16:57.440]  This sucks.
[16:58.260 --> 16:59.240]  What else do I have?
[16:59.880 --> 17:02.040]  I'm going to get that health, because I...
[17:02.040 --> 17:04.260]  There's other guns throughout.
[17:04.560 --> 17:05.880]  Yeah, there's health.
[17:05.980 --> 17:06.600]  I already grabbed the carbine.
[17:07.860 --> 17:09.180]  There's grenades over here.
[17:09.180 --> 17:11.160]  There's a health pack on the back side of the...
[17:12.480 --> 17:12.840]  ...thing.
[17:13.100 --> 17:14.520]  I think we just got to...
[17:14.520 --> 17:18.180]  I think we got to stay bunched up together to start, and then we can spread.
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.240]  I'm going to put a proximity mine over there.
[17:20.480 --> 17:21.680]  Alright, I'm going LNG now.
[17:21.720 --> 17:21.920]  That's a great idea.
[17:24.680 --> 17:25.440]  Please blow up.
[17:26.620 --> 17:29.720]  Oh, shit, it's a fucking armored zombie. Shit.
[17:30.160 --> 17:30.740]  Oh, balls!
[17:36.300 --> 17:38.960]  Oh my god, your rat mask scared the piss out of me.
[17:38.980 --> 17:39.840]  I was like, a big rat man!
[17:41.560 --> 17:42.720]  That's one of my surprises.
[17:43.020 --> 17:44.500]  That's one of my Eric surprises.
[17:44.680 --> 17:47.080]  Oh, some of our armored zombies are motherfuckers.
[17:47.520 --> 17:47.680]  He's tough.
[17:48.140 --> 17:48.960]  Oh, another one.
[17:52.040 --> 17:52.520]  Got him.
[17:52.700 --> 17:53.600]  Got him. Nice job, Eric.
[17:55.880 --> 17:56.660]  We got to...
[17:56.660 --> 17:57.500]  Oh, there's a shaman up there.
[17:57.580 --> 17:58.360]  There's a shaman up there.
[17:58.740 --> 17:59.380]  Where is he?
[18:01.020 --> 18:01.380]  Oh!
[18:01.580 --> 18:02.240]  You got to run, Nick.
[18:02.260 --> 18:02.800]  You got to move.
[18:03.220 --> 18:05.000]  Oh, god. Zombies everywhere.
[18:05.840 --> 18:06.340]  Not that way.
[18:06.900 --> 18:07.440]  Not that way.
[18:08.040 --> 18:09.040]  Oh my god, how much...
[18:09.040 --> 18:09.460]  Not that way.
[18:09.460 --> 18:10.080]  Hold on!
[18:10.880 --> 18:11.440]  Kill him!
[18:11.620 --> 18:12.820]  I got him, I got him, I got him.
[18:12.860 --> 18:15.220]  I died.
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.240]  I died.
[18:16.460 --> 18:16.820]  Fuck!
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.040]  Hold the line, fellas!
[18:20.560 --> 18:21.080]  Hold the line!
[18:21.080 --> 18:22.120]  I died where the shaman is.
[18:22.600 --> 18:23.520]  Yeah, I died where the shaman is.
[18:23.820 --> 18:24.780]  He's moving, he moved.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.100]  Gavin, to your right!
[18:28.840 --> 18:29.520]  Gavin, behind you.
[18:29.800 --> 18:30.220]  Thank you.
[18:30.460 --> 18:31.680]  I think I see him.
[18:31.900 --> 18:34.020]  Gavin, he's... yeah, there he is. He's right there to your right.
[18:34.860 --> 18:35.800]  He's near Gavin.
[18:36.680 --> 18:37.860]  Geoff, help put bullets in.
[18:38.360 --> 18:39.280]  There's one with me, too.
[18:40.380 --> 18:40.920]  There's two.
[18:41.260 --> 18:41.800]  I got an exploding guy, I'm dead.
[18:41.960 --> 18:42.180]  Fuck.
[18:42.940 --> 18:43.100]  Damn.
[18:43.300 --> 18:43.480]  Shit.
[18:43.880 --> 18:44.840]  I'm still up, I'm still up.
[18:46.840 --> 18:47.640]  Stay alive, Geoff!
[18:47.700 --> 18:48.800]  Not for long, not for long, not for long.
[18:49.840 --> 18:50.480]  Jesus Christ.
[18:50.680 --> 18:52.960]  Alright, I've got the Weasel News logo up.
[18:54.580 --> 18:55.220]  Undead mage.
[18:55.600 --> 18:56.720]  Tell me, do you lie from the cemetery?
[19:00.020 --> 19:03.720]  Gavin, if you could fucking get him off my back long enough for me to turn around and shoot.
[19:03.720 --> 19:06.160]  I mean, Gavin's in the same...
[19:06.600 --> 19:07.320]  He's in the same boat.
[19:09.780 --> 19:12.480]  We, uh, we respawn if they make it through this, by the way.
[19:13.760 --> 19:14.600]  Oh, really? Cool.
[19:14.700 --> 19:16.360]  Yeah, we'll come back if they survive.
[19:18.120 --> 19:18.820]  When we survive.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.580]  Oh God, don't let him blow up on you, Gavin!
[19:30.860 --> 19:32.020]  Son of a bitch!
[19:32.740 --> 19:33.740]  Oh my God!
[19:34.780 --> 19:37.240]  Come on, you guys got it. You're almost there. We're coming back.
[19:37.880 --> 19:38.900]  We're coming back.
[19:39.260 --> 19:39.420]  Yeah.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.560]  Oh, shit!
[19:41.900 --> 19:42.200]  Good work.
[19:42.940 --> 19:43.660]  Holy shit!
[19:43.960 --> 19:44.500]  Way to go, boys!
[19:44.700 --> 19:45.520]  Good content!
[19:45.880 --> 19:46.680]  Nice, Geoff!
[19:47.180 --> 19:48.160]  Holy God, Geoff!
[19:48.180 --> 19:49.100]  What gun are you using?
[19:49.360 --> 19:49.940]  Oh, minigun still.
[19:49.980 --> 19:51.100]  Damn, dude. Minigun still.
[19:51.520 --> 19:52.320]  Yeah, I should have saved it.
[19:53.380 --> 19:54.700]  Not for long. I don't have much left.
[19:54.760 --> 19:56.700]  Oh, yeah. You probably should have saved it for the harder levels, huh?
[19:56.880 --> 19:58.920]  Oh, we fucked up. We should have started with a pistol.
[20:00.680 --> 20:01.040]  Oh!
[20:02.800 --> 20:03.960]  That's really smart.
[20:04.280 --> 20:05.020]  Start with a pistol?
[20:05.700 --> 20:07.320]  Yeah, to conserve your ammo?
[20:07.780 --> 20:11.140]  Like, we blew through so many of, like, the easy guys with heavy ammo.
[20:12.780 --> 20:14.320]  Let me see...
[20:17.120 --> 20:18.340]  Well, it's a learning process.
[20:18.580 --> 20:18.780]  Yeah.
[20:21.680 --> 20:22.360]  Oh, pig!
[20:22.560 --> 20:24.560]  I'll start with the pistol on those easy guys right now.
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.600]  Pig! Pig!
[20:26.140 --> 20:27.640]  Really starting to matter at this level.
[20:28.620 --> 20:28.740]  Geoff, pig!
[20:28.740 --> 20:29.460]  Where's the pig's head?
[20:30.600 --> 20:31.140]  Oh, balls!
[20:31.660 --> 20:32.400]  I killed the pig.
[20:32.880 --> 20:33.340]  Alright, a pig death.
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.000]  There's more!
[20:34.720 --> 20:36.040]  Piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy!
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.660]  Oh, fuck. Geoff's in trouble.
[20:37.760 --> 20:38.080]  Oh, pig!
[20:38.360 --> 20:38.480]  Oh, shit.
[20:39.320 --> 20:39.840]  Run, Geoff!
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.340]  I was cooked.
[20:41.560 --> 20:41.980]  Run, Geoff!
[20:42.880 --> 20:43.900]  Oh, two pigs!
[20:46.460 --> 20:48.000]  Good god damn, dudes.
[20:49.340 --> 20:49.820]  Oh!
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.800]  Alright, I'm gonna go loud.
[20:54.680 --> 20:55.940]  Oh, fucking hell.
[20:56.560 --> 20:57.820]  I'm dead, I think.
[20:58.360 --> 20:59.180]  I went too loud.
[20:59.360 --> 20:59.820]  I'm dead.
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.120]  I shot a grenade launcher and it blew up in my face.
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.360]  It's a little loud.
[21:08.060 --> 21:09.500]  Alright, you got this.
[21:09.500 --> 21:09.840]  Good luck, Eric.
[21:10.380 --> 21:11.080]  Okay, thanks.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.160]  He lit himself on fire.
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.620]  It's like Nick playing Last of Us.
[21:16.620 --> 21:17.840]  I thought the fire was gonna help me out.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.820]  The fire did not help me out, guys.
[21:20.400 --> 21:22.080]  I mean, it might. It's setting them all on fire.
[21:22.360 --> 21:22.860]  It's doing pretty good.
[21:23.420 --> 21:25.080]  They're all on fire and then I'm on fire.
[21:25.080 --> 21:26.020]  Throw one behind you.
[21:26.120 --> 21:26.740]  Throw one on the ground.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.660]  Overhead spectator cam is amazing.
[21:28.720 --> 21:29.800]  Oh my god.
[21:30.140 --> 21:30.900]  They're everywhere.
[21:30.900 --> 21:31.460]  That is amazing.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.380]  Just keep running.
[21:34.340 --> 21:34.780]  Phenomenal.
[21:34.820 --> 21:35.680]  Eric, you're doing it.
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.940]  You gotta use somebody's overhead footage.
[21:38.360 --> 21:39.560]  It's so good.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.740]  Drop a grenade, Eric.
[21:41.780 --> 21:42.840]  I am, I am.
[21:44.360 --> 21:45.340]  There you go.
[21:50.240 --> 21:52.240]  You threw a grenade at one guy there.
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.360]  I'll try for this health, I guess.
[22:04.180 --> 22:05.500]  Is that health? Okay, thank god.
[22:06.640 --> 22:08.100]  Now it looks like Resident Evil 4.
[22:08.200 --> 22:08.680]  Oh, never mind.
[22:08.980 --> 22:09.820]  Holy shit.
[22:10.320 --> 22:10.820]  Oh, run.
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.860]  Oh, you got stickshot.
[22:13.300 --> 22:14.240]  Oh, that was Charlotte.
[22:17.500 --> 22:18.620]  Oh my god.
[22:18.680 --> 22:19.640]  It's hell on earth.
[22:20.420 --> 22:20.800]  Keep moving.
[22:21.040 --> 22:21.880]  You're doing it.
[22:21.880 --> 22:23.140]  Oh, you went through the stink.
[22:23.460 --> 22:24.160]  Where is he?
[22:24.240 --> 22:25.380]  You bumped into him.
[22:25.380 --> 22:26.280]  You're right by him.
[22:31.180 --> 22:32.920]  I was a little bit close.
[22:33.060 --> 22:34.120]  I was a little bit close.
[22:34.860 --> 22:35.940]  That was awesome.
[22:36.080 --> 22:37.040]  Wow, 43,000.
[22:37.100 --> 22:37.700]  Holy shit.
[22:38.300 --> 22:38.660]  Whoa.
[22:39.260 --> 22:41.140]  So do we start at the beginning now if we try again?
[22:41.480 --> 22:42.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:42.200 --> 22:42.960]  That's what it is.
[22:43.020 --> 22:43.780]  That's what the waves are.
[22:43.940 --> 22:44.980]  Well, why don't we do...
[22:44.980 --> 22:46.640]  Why don't we do it but be smart with ammo?
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.080]  Yeah, now we know.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.340]  You just have to...
[22:49.340 --> 22:55.000]  I think we start with, like, the heavy pistols and, like, the SMGs for, like, the first, like, three or four rounds.
[22:55.160 --> 22:57.040]  And then we start bumping up to, like, the heavy stuff.
[22:57.220 --> 22:58.760]  Because then you guys will have miniguns.
[22:59.360 --> 23:04.240]  But it's hard because you're gonna have to be so mobile that I don't know that it's gonna matter necessarily.
[23:04.560 --> 23:06.340]  Maybe we could just have one guy with a minigun.
[23:07.420 --> 23:07.740]  Interesting.
[23:10.240 --> 23:12.900]  We have all of our weapons, right?
[23:13.060 --> 23:13.200]  Yeah.
[23:13.380 --> 23:13.700]  Yes.
[23:13.920 --> 23:16.220]  I never looked at my weapon wheel the whole time because I had the minigun.
[23:16.340 --> 23:16.480]  Okay.
[23:16.480 --> 23:18.820]  Yeah, you have every...
[23:18.820 --> 23:20.500]  How did you keep ammo for so long?
[23:21.320 --> 23:21.500]  Who?
[23:21.780 --> 23:24.060]  I just... I was using the minigun very sparingly.
[23:24.260 --> 23:25.060]  I was...
[23:25.060 --> 23:26.020]  One body shot for...
[23:26.020 --> 23:29.940]  I was holding down the trigger for an entire round just sweeping around left and right.
[23:30.080 --> 23:32.580]  Yeah, see, I never did this until, like, wave eight.
[23:34.140 --> 23:36.120]  No wonder you pistol-aced so much fun!
[23:36.720 --> 23:39.640]  I shot 9,999 bullets.
[23:40.640 --> 23:45.900]  You spent so much money on the heist that I don't think you recouped any of the losses.
[23:46.280 --> 23:46.640]  Yeah.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.240]  Who's making a new instance?
[23:52.280 --> 23:54.240]  I'm still in the clouds. Hold on.
[23:54.580 --> 23:54.980]  Oh, okay.
[23:56.660 --> 23:58.840]  I'm a rat at sea, so just whenever you're ready.
[24:00.300 --> 24:03.220]  Oh, look at us! I just came out. We got career challenges.
[24:03.400 --> 24:03.840]  Hey, what's up, Nick?
[24:04.060 --> 24:04.340]  Hey, man.
[24:04.760 --> 24:06.200]  Uh, how do we...
[24:06.760 --> 24:07.520]  That's a great one.
[24:09.100 --> 24:11.100]  My footage is so good. Editor, you're welcome.
[24:12.600 --> 24:18.680]  Dude, we got some shots of you kiting the zombies on the top down and spectating me. That was so cool.
[24:18.760 --> 24:19.340]  It looked awesome.
[24:20.360 --> 24:22.640]  Dropping grenades while they chase you? That rocks.
[24:22.960 --> 24:25.160]  Uh, I gotta cook it a little bit longer next time, I think.
[24:25.780 --> 24:27.160]  Oh, yeah, I'm cooking a grenade right now.
[24:27.920 --> 24:30.600]  Yeah, he is. It's fucking annoying, because now we have a wanted level.
[24:31.120 --> 24:32.580]  Nah, that's from Nick Flair.
[24:34.180 --> 24:35.240]  That's from Nick Flair.
[24:37.280 --> 24:38.080]  Nick Flair.
[24:38.600 --> 24:41.820]  Well, this is my least favorite new personality, Nick Flair.
[24:43.440 --> 24:46.280]  Get us arrested before we get to the fucking challenge.
[24:47.240 --> 24:47.780]  That would be alright.
[24:49.640 --> 24:50.880]  You're not driving, asshole.
[24:53.480 --> 24:54.520]  You know what? Fair point.
[24:57.100 --> 24:59.340]  It's not like Gavin's not just as annoying.
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.040]  There's a grenade in the street up ahead. Watch out.
[25:01.480 --> 25:01.600]  Yeah.
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.300]  Two of them. Three.
[25:03.540 --> 25:04.600]  Cool guys don't care.
[25:05.940 --> 25:06.260]  Sweet.
[25:06.260 --> 25:08.560]  In that case...
[25:10.860 --> 25:12.280]  Uh-oh. Better drive.
[25:13.140 --> 25:13.540]  Nick?
[25:14.580 --> 25:16.680]  Well, Nick has destroyed my personal vehicle.
[25:16.880 --> 25:19.180]  He paid $16,000 towards my premium.
[25:19.260 --> 25:19.540]  You know what?
[25:19.820 --> 25:21.880]  The trick is not doing it so that we all die, though.
[25:24.300 --> 25:25.480]  Yeah, I'm getting it.
[25:25.680 --> 25:26.080]  Picking it up.
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.940]  You guys wanna ride in a van?
[25:30.940 --> 25:35.080]  Why don't we all join Fecal Beecle and then we can...
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.140]  Fly there.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.560]  It's so funny how much of like...
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.900]  How much of my life I spent in Achievement Hunter playing this game and building up these little universes that we fucked around in.
[25:47.200 --> 25:50.880]  And it's so weird to go back through it now without them, you know?
[25:51.180 --> 25:51.440]  Yeah.
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.120]  But it's like GTA Online's still here.
[25:57.540 --> 25:58.420]  Nick, get in.
[25:58.840 --> 25:59.160]  I'm coming.
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.100]  It's gonna get to the point soon where some of the blocks we placed in Minecraft are old enough to drink.
[26:08.200 --> 26:08.560]  Geoff?
[26:09.280 --> 26:09.560]  Yeah?
[26:10.600 --> 26:11.420]  You shooting at me?
[26:11.900 --> 26:15.000]  Yeah, this is the beacon of... I've arrived.
[26:16.320 --> 26:18.160]  Okay, I see you guys in the game now.
[26:18.520 --> 26:19.740]  So I guess I'm in your game.
[26:20.240 --> 26:21.780]  Sweet. We'll come pick you up.
[26:22.620 --> 26:24.360]  Oh, okay. I'm like not close to you.
[26:24.900 --> 26:25.380]  Where you at?
[26:26.180 --> 26:27.240]  All the way bottom right.
[26:28.100 --> 26:29.320]  It's where we respawned.
[26:29.500 --> 26:30.100]  Bottom right.
[26:30.100 --> 26:31.700]  Oh, he's over where we were.
[26:32.080 --> 26:34.520]  I feel like after 11 years...
[26:37.420 --> 26:39.180]  That guy stopped calling me.
[26:39.400 --> 26:40.180]  What's it called?
[26:41.060 --> 26:41.520]  Simeon?
[26:41.700 --> 26:43.080]  Simeon stopped calling me about cars.
[26:43.240 --> 26:43.380]  Oh yeah.
[26:44.080 --> 26:45.840]  I get mod calls.
[26:46.420 --> 26:51.760]  I get mod echoes and Lester and somebody's kid for a fucking nightclub or something.
[26:51.880 --> 26:52.840]  They just never stops.
[26:58.570 --> 26:59.490]  Let's go.
[27:00.050 --> 27:00.270]  Oh!
[27:00.970 --> 27:01.670]  Uh oh.
[27:01.810 --> 27:01.990]  Oh.
[27:01.990 --> 27:04.010]  I think you left him.
[27:04.530 --> 27:05.070]  Thanks, man.
[27:06.210 --> 27:07.850]  Right on, man. Thank you.
[27:09.990 --> 27:10.910]  There we go.
[27:14.070 --> 27:14.590]  Pretty cool.
[27:15.870 --> 27:18.250]  Your archenemy, Nick, is already in this section.
[27:18.370 --> 27:20.590]  Could someone mock me the cemetery?
[27:21.070 --> 27:21.530]  Yeah, I'll do it.
[27:22.030 --> 27:23.810]  Look at us. From enemies to associates.
[27:24.030 --> 27:24.170]  There you go.
[27:24.950 --> 27:25.670]  Enemies to lovers.
[27:26.130 --> 27:27.750]  It's a trope and those books are wise, dude.
[27:27.770 --> 27:28.610]  Go under the bridge. Go under the bridge.
[27:30.930 --> 27:31.250]  Uh oh.
[27:31.250 --> 27:31.530]  Yes!
[27:32.530 --> 27:33.610]  That was sick!
[27:33.850 --> 27:34.850]  Alright, I'll take us to the windmills.
[27:36.610 --> 27:37.830]  Go under the bridge.
[27:39.410 --> 27:41.550]  I still never got the go under every bridge achievement.
[27:41.750 --> 27:43.750]  I'm missing one bridge and I don't know which one it is.
[27:44.070 --> 27:44.990]  Oh, that's crazy.
[27:45.650 --> 27:48.090]  You know who's really good at flying in this game?
[27:48.310 --> 27:48.430]  Me.
[27:48.430 --> 27:49.290]  You gotta give credit to Patil.
[27:50.030 --> 27:51.410]  Yeah, Jack Patillo.
[27:51.590 --> 27:56.610]  He landed a jet on the street in the middle of a heist that I thought was so impressive.
[27:56.970 --> 27:57.610]  Wow, that's cool.
[27:57.610 --> 28:00.510]  He is so fucking good at flying.
[28:02.070 --> 28:04.250]  Airplanes specifically, but helicopters as well in this game.
[28:04.330 --> 28:09.390]  Yeah, he extracted us with the private jet from the middle of the street during one of our made up heists.
[28:10.090 --> 28:10.590]  That's awesome.
[28:10.610 --> 28:11.210]  It is a legit talent.
[28:12.830 --> 28:13.550]  Beautiful sunset.
[28:15.150 --> 28:16.070]  Ghosts will be out soon.
[28:16.330 --> 28:16.830]  We should try to get those.
[28:16.950 --> 28:19.010]  Oh shit, I wonder where the...
[28:19.010 --> 28:21.030]  Somebody look up where the first ghost is. It's in a cemetery.
[28:21.190 --> 28:22.050]  I wonder if it's where we are.
[28:22.090 --> 28:22.650]  What time is it?
[28:23.010 --> 28:24.110]  It's almost 7 o'clock.
[28:24.310 --> 28:25.690]  Oh my god, this could be perfect.
[28:29.290 --> 28:34.530]  I like that he got excited, told us to look it up, then he immediately started looking it up.
[28:34.790 --> 28:36.990]  Hey guys, welcome to Regulation Haunter.
[28:40.750 --> 28:41.890]  Regulation Haunter, huh?
[28:42.370 --> 28:43.110]  Ready to drop?
[28:43.930 --> 28:44.090]  Yep.
[28:44.810 --> 28:45.790]  Go for it.
[28:52.970 --> 28:54.650]  Oops, didn't pull my shooting time.
[28:55.110 --> 28:55.570]  Beautiful.
[28:57.890 --> 28:58.470]  Way to go.
[28:59.710 --> 29:01.010]  That was pretty cool.
[29:01.130 --> 29:02.190]  Guys, we are...
[29:02.830 --> 29:04.510]  Oh, we're here for the ghost.
[29:04.870 --> 29:05.690]  Oh, what? We are?
[29:05.970 --> 29:07.090]  Are we? Alright, should we stick around for it?
[29:07.250 --> 29:08.730]  It shows up 7 to 8.
[29:09.490 --> 29:09.810]  Hey Gavin.
[29:10.530 --> 29:10.670]  Yeah.
[29:10.950 --> 29:14.070]  Either on a grave or on the church roof at the cemetery.
[29:14.310 --> 29:15.130]  That looks pretty cool.
[29:15.190 --> 29:15.590]  At what time?
[29:15.730 --> 29:15.890]  Does that look cool?
[29:15.930 --> 29:18.790]  So, it's from 7 to 8 p.m.
[29:19.210 --> 29:20.150]  It should be available.
[29:20.310 --> 29:21.850]  And it's 7.30 right now.
[29:21.910 --> 29:23.130]  So, everybody look for a ghost.
[29:23.350 --> 29:23.590]  Okay.
[29:24.330 --> 29:25.130]  Gavin's taking...
[29:25.130 --> 29:26.130]  I think Gavin's taking my picture.
[29:28.710 --> 29:29.430]  It's just...
[29:31.430 --> 29:32.270]  Alright, let's go.
[29:32.330 --> 29:33.130]  I just want to see if it looks cool.
[29:33.290 --> 29:34.430]  Alright, everyone look for a ghost.
[29:34.550 --> 29:35.590]  Okay, you said it shows up where?
[29:35.890 --> 29:36.430]  It's either...
[29:36.430 --> 29:36.890]  What did it say?
[29:38.650 --> 29:41.670]  Either on a grave or on the church roof at the cemetery.
[29:42.290 --> 29:43.630]  Located in the Pacific Bluffs.
[29:44.270 --> 29:44.630]  Church?
[29:45.790 --> 29:48.710]  I don't know where the church roof is over here, but we're at the graves.
[29:49.830 --> 29:50.970]  Is it Pacific Bluffs? I guess.
[29:51.570 --> 29:51.830]  Yeah.
[29:51.850 --> 29:54.010]  I think the church roof is...
[29:54.010 --> 29:54.890]  Oh, it's over there.
[29:55.510 --> 29:56.010]  Where's that?
[29:57.410 --> 29:58.410]  East. Southeast.
[29:59.510 --> 29:59.830]  Southeast?
[30:00.150 --> 30:00.810]  Following Nick.
[30:00.990 --> 30:01.230]  Okay.
[30:01.950 --> 30:02.270]  Southeast.
[30:05.210 --> 30:06.010]  I see a ghost!
[30:06.510 --> 30:07.050]  Do you really?
[30:07.070 --> 30:08.210]  I see a faint thing.
[30:08.290 --> 30:08.830]  Do I need to get a picture?
[30:09.290 --> 30:09.930]  Yeah, get a picture.
[30:10.310 --> 30:11.550]  I see two ghosts on a bench.
[30:12.370 --> 30:13.130]  No, those are people.
[30:16.210 --> 30:16.830]  I got a figure.
[30:18.170 --> 30:19.390]  Oh, I hear spooky stuff.
[30:22.230 --> 30:23.410]  Oh, wow, I see it too.
[30:23.530 --> 30:24.310]  Sunday Ghosts Exposed.
[30:24.370 --> 30:25.290]  We did it! I did it!
[30:25.290 --> 30:26.590]  Oh, shit!
[30:27.750 --> 30:29.010]  How do you do this?
[30:29.710 --> 30:29.850]  Dude!
[30:30.130 --> 30:30.850]  Get your phone out.
[30:31.670 --> 30:32.590]  Get your phone out.
[30:32.730 --> 30:33.810]  Oh, I got it!
[30:33.930 --> 30:34.550]  Ghost Exposed!
[30:34.650 --> 30:35.130]  It's gone.
[30:35.470 --> 30:36.050]  I got it!
[30:36.050 --> 30:37.830]  I took a picture of where it was.
[30:38.010 --> 30:38.410]  Yeah, me too.
[30:39.270 --> 30:40.150]  I suck!
[30:40.590 --> 30:41.030]  It's gone.
[30:41.470 --> 30:41.950]  I got 40.
[30:42.390 --> 30:43.770]  It's 803, it just left.
[30:44.130 --> 30:45.270]  Oh, shit!
[30:45.910 --> 30:47.350]  I took a picture of 803.
[30:48.110 --> 30:50.050]  I've never, like, used the phone in this.
[30:50.170 --> 30:50.830]  I've never had to do this.
[30:50.830 --> 30:52.490]  They paid me $40,000.
[30:52.890 --> 30:54.630]  Is that how Peter Parker makes his money?
[30:54.630 --> 30:58.050]  Wow, you got $40,000 for that?
[30:58.390 --> 30:59.010]  Yeah, dude.
[30:59.510 --> 31:05.070]  So now, uh, that's a whole other video, but we should definitely do a video where we get all the ghosts.
[31:05.230 --> 31:06.290]  Wow, that's so fun!
[31:07.110 --> 31:07.350]  Yeah.
[31:07.650 --> 31:09.010]  We'll start here next time.
[31:09.550 --> 31:11.190]  Yeah, me and Gavin are at zero ghosts.
[31:11.390 --> 31:12.010]  Oh, my God, what's this?
[31:12.030 --> 31:14.670]  We'll start here right at 7pm next time, and then we'll just run.
[31:14.970 --> 31:15.410]  What is this?
[31:15.870 --> 31:16.570]  It's the figure.
[31:17.110 --> 31:20.590]  I have two of 100 figures.
[31:21.810 --> 31:23.430]  Oh, yeah, you gotta get the action figures.
[31:23.430 --> 31:24.170]  I got four.
[31:24.910 --> 31:27.370]  I think we did collectible guides in those, maybe.
[31:28.090 --> 31:29.470]  I never got the playing cards.
[31:29.650 --> 31:30.530]  Oh, fuck!
[31:33.390 --> 31:34.630]  Get out of here!
[31:36.070 --> 31:37.610]  Leave my CEO alone.
[31:37.810 --> 31:39.830]  Yeah, well, he punched me.
[31:40.230 --> 31:40.550]  One more time?
[31:41.250 --> 31:41.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:42.270 --> 31:45.150]  I'm gonna start the lobby, and then I'll invite you.
[31:45.210 --> 31:46.930]  Alright, alright, you just invite us.
[31:47.530 --> 31:49.550]  When did I become in charge of GTA lobbies?
[31:49.670 --> 31:50.530]  I love it.
[31:50.570 --> 31:52.490]  It works when you do it.
[31:52.490 --> 31:53.470]  It does, but...
[31:53.470 --> 31:55.030]  It didn't do me shit. I didn't get shit.
[31:55.330 --> 31:57.050]  You forbade Andrew.
[31:57.970 --> 31:58.670]  It's true.
[31:59.010 --> 32:01.450]  Honestly, no one doing it is better than Andrew doing it.
[32:04.230 --> 32:06.850]  I can't believe we found a ghost thing.
[32:06.850 --> 32:08.170]  That's so awesome, dude.
[32:09.010 --> 32:10.850]  I'm excited. We got this. This is it.
[32:11.350 --> 32:13.450]  Yeah, I'm gonna start with the pistol, or the SMG.
[32:14.670 --> 32:18.270]  You and I are the exact same level in this game. How's that possible?
[32:18.810 --> 32:20.690]  We need the exact same number of videos.
[32:21.750 --> 32:24.310]  I'm also gonna look around more.
[32:24.570 --> 32:28.310]  I feel like we stayed in this area, but when I was running around, there's so much stuff everywhere.
[32:29.350 --> 32:31.550]  There might be a better place for us to hole up, too.
[32:32.230 --> 32:34.710]  I doubt there's gonna be, but we should definitely look.
[32:36.170 --> 32:38.850]  Alright, you can't jump over the spiky bits.
[32:39.050 --> 32:39.570]  That's good to know.
[32:42.150 --> 32:42.770]  Let's see.
[32:43.210 --> 32:44.610]  Grenades are over here.
[32:45.030 --> 32:46.250]  SMG over here.
[32:46.570 --> 32:47.770]  There's health behind the church.
[32:49.750 --> 32:50.970]  So, if you need to book it.
[32:51.590 --> 32:54.150]  There's a hatchet in this backside.
[32:54.510 --> 32:56.010]  Oh, an assault shotgun. Hell yeah.
[32:58.170 --> 33:00.550]  I don't think it was a high enough level to buy that yet.
[33:06.070 --> 33:11.830]  I remember we used to just grind levels out in the early days in the AH office so that we could unlock stuff to make videos in.
[33:12.110 --> 33:13.590]  Oh, was that like the point?
[33:13.970 --> 33:16.710]  I think Ray and Michael were level 100 week one.
[33:16.710 --> 33:22.250]  It was just to be able to buy equipment, unlock equipment in the game to film with.
[33:22.630 --> 33:23.790]  I refuse to grind.
[33:24.110 --> 33:26.250]  I refuse to farm anything in any game. Hate it.
[33:26.930 --> 33:27.890]  That's not fun.
[33:29.950 --> 33:33.130]  Dude, using the pistol in this mode and just getting headshots rocks.
[33:33.890 --> 33:37.870]  Gavin, that's probably why you and I are both level 131 and they're all level 700 right now.
[33:42.170 --> 33:42.950]  Woah, Gavin!
[33:44.950 --> 33:45.970]  What was it I didn't see?
[33:45.970 --> 33:46.570]  One.
[33:47.210 --> 33:47.690]  One.
[33:48.750 --> 33:50.510]  Is the loneliest number that...
[33:53.800 --> 33:54.760]  Anything up here?
[33:55.800 --> 33:58.880]  Ooh, is that a fucking heavy ass shotgun or what?
[33:59.560 --> 34:01.320]  Yeah, it looks like some sort of a drum shotgun.
[34:01.580 --> 34:02.180]  A sweeper?
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.780]  Oh, I've never used that.
[34:05.360 --> 34:06.460]  Janitor mode.
[34:07.580 --> 34:09.320]  Ooh, a smidge.
[34:10.480 --> 34:10.820]  Pig.
[34:11.720 --> 34:12.200]  Pig!
[34:13.280 --> 34:14.660]  Ooh, molotov up here, alright.
[34:15.840 --> 34:16.380]  Dead pig.
[34:17.940 --> 34:19.140]  That's some dead pig.
[34:20.580 --> 34:21.480]  That'll do, pig.
[34:25.420 --> 34:27.020]  I love a pig in the city.
[34:31.180 --> 34:37.080]  Hey, in Charlotte's Web, why did they suddenly give a shit about the pig when the spider was the one spelling out all that stuff?
[34:37.740 --> 34:39.480]  Because they thought the pig was doing it?
[34:40.000 --> 34:40.520]  Are they stupid?
[34:40.520 --> 34:41.440]  Yeah, that's kind of the whole point.
[34:42.840 --> 34:43.880]  I mean, yeah, they're farmers.
[34:45.020 --> 34:45.380]  Jesus.
[34:45.540 --> 34:46.180]  Take that, farmers.
[34:47.080 --> 34:48.540]  That's right, we're coming after you.
[34:48.740 --> 34:49.320]  That's right.
[34:49.320 --> 34:51.360]  Eric supports Monsanto and no one else.
[34:51.600 --> 34:52.220]  That's right.
[34:52.380 --> 34:54.120]  Dude, they make so much good food.
[34:54.240 --> 34:54.740]  Hell yeah.
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.520]  Man, all this shooting is making me excited for my minigun phase.
[35:07.120 --> 35:07.180]  Yeah.
[35:08.680 --> 35:09.560]  Very nice.
[35:10.860 --> 35:12.420]  Yeah, this pistol's not fun.
[35:13.080 --> 35:14.800]  Oh, I'm having a great time.
[35:14.900 --> 35:15.220]  I love giving him the pistol.
[35:16.260 --> 35:18.480]  I think starting with a pistol is kind of extreme.
[35:19.420 --> 35:19.640]  Why?
[35:19.820 --> 35:20.460]  I think it's...
[35:20.460 --> 35:21.040]  I really...
[35:21.040 --> 35:22.780]  Because there's all the ammo in the world.
[35:23.740 --> 35:25.140]  Right now there is, sure.
[35:27.080 --> 35:29.180]  I guess it's because Gavin and I have a lot of guns.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.240]  Yeah.
[35:31.500 --> 35:32.060]  I got a handful.
[35:32.780 --> 35:33.920]  Maybe I'll use the Widowmaker.
[35:34.960 --> 35:36.300]  I was just looking at it.
[35:37.460 --> 35:39.260]  Maybe we should use the Up and Atomizer.
[35:39.480 --> 35:40.740]  Just send them flying through the air.
[35:42.260 --> 35:43.580]  Hey, don't you have like a laser gun?
[35:50.400 --> 35:52.080]  I hear them, but I don't see them.
[35:52.380 --> 35:52.860]  Oh, there they are.
[35:52.940 --> 35:53.580]  They're all over my neck.
[35:53.580 --> 35:54.540]  Oh, hello.
[35:57.520 --> 35:58.240]  Excuse me.
[36:01.160 --> 36:03.160]  Dude, I love using the pistol in this fucking game.
[36:03.160 --> 36:03.620]  I'm having fun.
[36:03.760 --> 36:04.500]  I think it's so fun.
[36:05.260 --> 36:05.940]  Who's screaming?
[36:06.080 --> 36:06.840]  Stop screaming.
[36:07.240 --> 36:07.840]  Yeah, we get it.
[36:07.880 --> 36:08.460]  You're undead.
[36:08.780 --> 36:09.200]  Chill out.
[36:09.340 --> 36:11.440]  Shut the fuck up.
[36:14.460 --> 36:15.340]  Oh, I'm getting hit.
[36:15.740 --> 36:16.220]  Get off me.
[36:17.480 --> 36:17.880]  Got him.
[36:19.240 --> 36:20.200]  Geoff, guys behind you.
[36:20.360 --> 36:20.560]  I kind of like what he was about to do.
[36:20.780 --> 36:21.180]  I got him.
[36:22.060 --> 36:23.020]  Just be careful.
[36:23.080 --> 36:24.260]  If you're going to turn around, there's a wire.
[36:24.480 --> 36:24.520]  Oh, shit.
[36:24.520 --> 36:25.760]  Oh, they're all coming up.
[36:25.860 --> 36:26.480]  They're coming up.
[36:29.160 --> 36:29.660]  Funnel them.
[36:29.740 --> 36:30.560]  I'll kill them all for you.
[36:31.520 --> 36:32.560]  Alright, well, I'm using a pistol.
[36:38.000 --> 36:38.840]  This is fun.
[36:39.160 --> 36:42.720]  You know, I think maybe defending this hilltop is not a bad way to go.
[36:42.860 --> 36:45.480]  No, we're going to get scooted off of it pretty quick, I think.
[36:46.820 --> 36:48.580]  Okay, well, this can be a nice hideaway.
[36:48.920 --> 36:49.240]  Hideaway?
[36:49.700 --> 36:50.020]  Hideaway.
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.200]  You got it.
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.260]  How are you doing over there, Gavin?
[36:53.260 --> 36:54.300]  Pretty good.
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.560]  Pretty good so far.
[37:12.170 --> 37:13.550]  Oh, his silence.
[37:13.950 --> 37:16.270]  Did you just silence a pig, Nick?
[37:16.310 --> 37:18.270]  Yeah, he doesn't want the pig to know.
[37:18.530 --> 37:19.050]  Yeah, listen.
[37:19.170 --> 37:22.890]  I wanted him to not know who his murderer was.
[37:23.170 --> 37:25.170]  James Bonding, a pig.
[37:27.370 --> 37:32.150]  Oh, they're coming up the stairs, boys.
[37:32.530 --> 37:32.990]  Here we go.
[37:32.990 --> 37:33.330]  We got him.
[37:35.310 --> 37:35.630]  Hello.
[37:35.990 --> 37:36.310]  Hello.
[37:40.160 --> 37:40.480]  Pardon.
[37:40.620 --> 37:41.300]  Excuse me.
[37:44.480 --> 37:45.100]  Oh, fuck.
[37:45.240 --> 37:46.040]  It's an armored guy.
[37:46.760 --> 37:48.140]  Try to aim for his head, I guess?
[37:48.180 --> 37:48.760]  I don't really know.
[37:49.660 --> 37:50.260]  You got him.
[37:50.280 --> 37:50.900]  Way to go, man.
[37:51.440 --> 37:51.980]  More here.
[37:52.080 --> 37:52.840]  More guys here.
[37:54.140 --> 37:54.520]  Oh, yeah.
[37:56.880 --> 37:57.380]  Chill out.
[37:59.220 --> 37:59.800]  We got him.
[37:59.800 --> 38:00.280]  We got him, Nick.
[38:00.280 --> 38:00.880]  You don't have to worry about it.
[38:01.460 --> 38:02.200]  I'm killing guys.
[38:03.120 --> 38:04.020]  No, I mean behind you.
[38:04.260 --> 38:04.580]  Oh, thanks.
[38:05.920 --> 38:06.920]  Oh, I was looking at Gavin.
[38:07.380 --> 38:08.320]  You might not have to worry about it.
[38:09.320 --> 38:09.880]  Oh, thanks.
[38:12.540 --> 38:13.380]  Someone else can get him.
[38:13.720 --> 38:14.680]  Oh, that one's coming up the stairs.
[38:15.080 --> 38:15.240]  Is that a fire guy?
[38:15.720 --> 38:15.880]  Yeah.
[38:17.320 --> 38:18.420]  Well, he was a fire guy.
[38:22.100 --> 38:22.820]  We did it.
[38:29.180 --> 38:30.520]  Gavin, top of the pops.
[38:31.220 --> 38:32.240]  Top of the pops.
[38:34.500 --> 38:35.740]  Top of the pops to you.
[38:37.880 --> 38:39.540]  Is that a Rezalo's reference?
[38:42.240 --> 38:42.960]  I guess not.
[38:43.680 --> 38:44.400]  It's Rezalo's.
[38:44.480 --> 38:44.920]  Yeah, what is that?
[38:45.060 --> 38:46.720]  It's a band that sang that song, Top of the Pops.
[38:46.920 --> 38:49.080]  Oh, no. Top of the Pops is like a British...
[38:49.080 --> 38:49.320]  Yeah.
[38:49.900 --> 38:50.260]  Yeah.
[38:51.180 --> 38:52.040]  But it was a song.
[38:52.380 --> 38:54.200]  Everyone's on top of the...
[38:54.200 --> 38:55.100]  Oh, they're all behind us.
[38:58.380 --> 39:00.940]  They also sang that Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonight song.
[39:01.160 --> 39:01.600]  Oh, cool.
[39:02.220 --> 39:04.920]  Somebody's gonna get their head kicked...
[39:04.920 --> 39:05.500]  Yeah, that song.
[39:06.780 --> 39:07.520]  I got you, Geoff.
[39:08.240 --> 39:08.800]  Thank you, Nick.
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.320]  I'd be real bummed if this gun was actually using my minigun, am I?
[39:18.380 --> 39:19.040]  Nice throw, Eric.
[39:19.480 --> 39:20.280]  Thank you.
[39:20.540 --> 39:21.100]  That was nice.
[39:22.700 --> 39:24.080]  Oh, shit. They're all behind us, Geoff.
[39:24.700 --> 39:25.480]  Oh, balls!
[39:26.440 --> 39:27.820]  Oh, there's fucking deer here.
[39:27.880 --> 39:29.520]  There's deer? We got deer?
[39:35.320 --> 39:35.720]  Alright.
[39:36.440 --> 39:37.760]  That was dicey for a second.
[39:38.200 --> 39:41.200]  They just came up really quick behind us. That was like very sudden.
[39:41.680 --> 39:43.180]  I'm gonna run up against this wall.
[39:47.240 --> 39:50.820]  You keep shooting your way, and then I'll just cover this from the side.
[39:50.840 --> 39:51.780]  Blue on fire guy coming up the stairs?
[39:53.060 --> 39:53.560]  Oh, shit.
[39:54.040 --> 39:54.820]  He's coming to you guys.
[39:55.420 --> 39:56.800]  He's got... we got him. He explodes.
[39:58.940 --> 40:02.040]  So, blue on fire guy explodes when he dies?
[40:02.420 --> 40:02.600]  Yeah.
[40:02.780 --> 40:03.100]  He's like this thing?
[40:03.360 --> 40:04.160]  He's like a boomer.
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.880]  Okay, boomer. Right?
[40:08.280 --> 40:09.160]  Guys? Hello?
[40:10.300 --> 40:12.240]  I'm alive, but...
[40:12.240 --> 40:13.580]  Very badly injured.
[40:16.580 --> 40:16.920]  Woo.
[40:17.360 --> 40:18.420]  Yeah, it's getting dicey.
[40:18.520 --> 40:18.740]  Nice.
[40:20.200 --> 40:22.720]  Starting to time my reloads a little bit.
[40:23.580 --> 40:24.220]  Yeah, you're having to.
[40:25.720 --> 40:26.460]  This is a fun mode.
[40:27.320 --> 40:27.780]  I like it a lot.
[40:27.940 --> 40:28.520]  What gun are you using, Gav?
[40:29.560 --> 40:30.880]  Uh, just the assault rifle.
[40:31.600 --> 40:31.820]  Yeah.
[40:31.940 --> 40:33.100]  I don't know what gun that is.
[40:33.140 --> 40:33.780]  What are you talking about, baby?
[40:34.440 --> 40:35.160]  What is it, like an AK?
[40:35.600 --> 40:36.040]  Ooh, money.
[40:36.220 --> 40:37.980]  Yeah, I'm using the bullpup. It's good.
[40:38.480 --> 40:40.320]  Oh, yeah. That's a... that's a good idea.
[40:42.140 --> 40:43.560]  Okay, let's get back to...
[40:44.500 --> 40:44.860]  Molotov.
[40:45.180 --> 40:47.620]  See if we can take anyone out at the rip.
[40:50.100 --> 40:51.780]  Where are they coming from? Where are they coming from?
[40:52.180 --> 40:53.300]  Ah! They're coming from back here!
[40:56.540 --> 40:58.980]  Do they actually get harder to kill as well? Or are they just...
[40:58.980 --> 40:59.220]  Yes.
[40:59.740 --> 41:00.980]  They're definitely harder to kill.
[41:01.340 --> 41:02.960]  They have more... they have more health.
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.640]  You gotta, like, aim more for, like, the head, I think.
[41:05.840 --> 41:06.580]  Headshots matter.
[41:06.940 --> 41:07.120]  Yep.
[41:09.240 --> 41:10.280]  Alright, let's do this.
[41:11.900 --> 41:13.680]  Oh, they are charging that mound.
[41:14.120 --> 41:15.120]  Oh! I'm coming up!
[41:16.960 --> 41:18.520]  I'll make sure they don't get behind you, Gav.
[41:19.400 --> 41:19.760]  Thanks.
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.140]  Luckily, they're setting each other on fire now.
[41:22.220 --> 41:22.400]  Yeah.
[41:23.160 --> 41:24.420]  I don't know if that's good or bad.
[41:25.020 --> 41:25.420]  Yeah, really.
[41:25.700 --> 41:26.060]  Uh, depends.
[41:26.800 --> 41:28.280]  There's another Molotov right there.
[41:28.760 --> 41:28.920]  Oh!
[41:29.100 --> 41:30.780]  Shaman! Shaman! Shaman! Shaman!
[41:31.380 --> 41:32.240]  Where is he?
[41:32.260 --> 41:33.260]  Undead priest where?
[41:33.680 --> 41:34.520]  Oh, I think I see him.
[41:34.520 --> 41:35.060]  He's down by the end.
[41:36.120 --> 41:36.440]  Is he?
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.540]  I'm mini-gunning him.
[41:38.000 --> 41:38.180]  Okay.
[41:38.960 --> 41:39.360]  Oh!
[41:39.540 --> 41:40.140]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[41:40.260 --> 41:40.880]  Everyone else keep moving.
[41:41.480 --> 41:42.460]  Did you get him or no?
[41:42.720 --> 41:43.120]  No.
[41:43.380 --> 41:44.580]  I got set on fire.
[41:45.220 --> 41:45.720]  Hot foot!
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.020]  Where is he?
[41:48.460 --> 41:50.100]  This has gotten out of control fast.
[41:50.280 --> 41:50.520]  Yeah.
[41:51.020 --> 41:52.000]  The ender shaman's tough.
[41:52.460 --> 41:52.780]  I got you.
[41:54.100 --> 41:55.360]  He's a fire guy.
[41:55.820 --> 41:57.180]  So, is there still one around?
[41:57.860 --> 41:58.560]  I think so.
[41:58.560 --> 41:58.720]  I think so.
[41:59.860 --> 42:00.940]  Alright, I'm going mini-gun.
[42:01.080 --> 42:01.400]  Fuck it.
[42:04.140 --> 42:04.540]  Whoa!
[42:06.120 --> 42:07.740]  Yeah, I think he's at the back right.
[42:09.880 --> 42:10.560]  You see him?
[42:11.220 --> 42:11.960]  Whoa, shit!
[42:13.620 --> 42:14.340]  I'm covering you.
[42:14.400 --> 42:15.400]  I'm covering you the best I can.
[42:16.740 --> 42:17.280]  I'm going to go.
[42:17.320 --> 42:19.000]  I'm going to run after him with my RPG.
[42:21.440 --> 42:21.980]  I'll keep you covered.
[42:22.020 --> 42:22.420]  Where is the damn thing?
[42:23.880 --> 42:24.600]  Oh, I see him.
[42:26.940 --> 42:27.600]  I got you.
[42:27.900 --> 42:28.280]  I got you.
[42:28.400 --> 42:28.620]  I think I killed him.
[42:28.820 --> 42:29.300]  I think I got him.
[42:29.600 --> 42:30.240]  I think you got him.
[42:30.540 --> 42:30.860]  Keep moving.
[42:31.300 --> 42:31.920]  No, no, no.
[42:31.960 --> 42:32.800]  I think...
[42:32.800 --> 42:33.720]  Is he still around?
[42:33.820 --> 42:34.400]  There's still green.
[42:34.420 --> 42:35.220]  There's still smoke.
[42:35.320 --> 42:36.540]  Yeah, there's definitely still green.
[42:36.540 --> 42:37.320]  There might be another one.
[42:37.880 --> 42:39.440]  Oh, we got him.
[42:39.820 --> 42:40.060]  We're good.
[42:43.480 --> 42:45.220]  People are going to watch this back and be like,
[42:45.240 --> 42:46.060]  How did they not see him?
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.700]  Because of the zombies everywhere.
[42:48.700 --> 42:49.620]  This is the last decade of my life.
[42:49.860 --> 42:50.400]  Yeah, no kidding.
[42:51.180 --> 42:52.660]  I can play the game better than that.
[42:52.800 --> 42:53.460]  Oh, is that what we're doing?
[42:56.040 --> 42:57.200]  Well, they think so.
[42:58.020 --> 43:01.180]  I have watched back our own videos and felt the same way, to be fair.
[43:01.420 --> 43:02.180]  Oh, 100%.
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.580]  How am I not seeing that?
[43:04.700 --> 43:05.200]  What an idiot.
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.680]  It's because you're fucking paying attention to five other people talking at the same time.
[43:10.280 --> 43:19.400]  And trying also probably to drive a narrative and come up with a beginning, middle and end of a fucking let's play that's broken.
[43:19.400 --> 43:20.060]  Watch out for deer!
[43:20.260 --> 43:24.320]  That you're trying to make the best of in a game that you invented that everybody's trying to ruin.
[43:24.920 --> 43:26.440]  It's not like...
[43:26.440 --> 43:28.800]  It's not like it was easy what you were doing.
[43:30.520 --> 43:32.580]  Playing the video game part was like...
[43:35.820 --> 43:36.340]  Watch it, Nick!
[43:36.420 --> 43:37.160]  No, Nick, Nick, Nick!
[43:38.820 --> 43:41.540]  You started coming up and then you started going back down. I'm sorry.
[43:41.820 --> 43:42.740]  No, you're fine. It didn't hurt me.
[43:42.780 --> 43:43.940]  I thought we were on the same page.
[43:44.120 --> 43:45.500]  No, no, it didn't hurt me. It didn't hurt me. You're fine.
[43:46.260 --> 43:47.340]  Okay, I hear someone big and fast.
[43:47.340 --> 43:48.160]  They're spawning behind us.
[43:48.960 --> 43:49.180]  Behind us.
[43:49.480 --> 43:51.920]  Behind? Alright. Oh, there you go. Thank you. Good call out.
[43:52.340 --> 43:52.600]  You're welcome.
[43:53.300 --> 43:56.720]  He's always made me laugh so much because I always felt like playing video games was like...
[43:56.720 --> 43:57.160]  Eric, you got a blue guy.
[43:57.760 --> 43:59.660]  30% of what we were doing in those videos.
[43:59.660 --> 44:01.000]  Oh, yeah. Maybe like 25.
[44:01.720 --> 44:01.960]  Yeah.
[44:03.000 --> 44:06.280]  Ow. Son of an ass. It's always one boss trying to get away from me.
[44:06.340 --> 44:07.120]  Thank you. Thanks, Nick.
[44:07.640 --> 44:09.460]  Oh, the blue guy got by me. He's coming up the stairs.
[44:12.240 --> 44:15.040]  I struggle to lock onto the fire guys for some reason.
[44:15.520 --> 44:16.860]  What? Get up! Get up!
[44:19.180 --> 44:20.520]  Oh, we got a fire guy.
[44:21.000 --> 44:21.360]  Bigfoot?
[44:21.940 --> 44:23.300]  No, we got a fire guy.
[44:25.240 --> 44:25.860]  Come on.
[44:26.040 --> 44:26.500]  Did he die?
[44:27.000 --> 44:27.720]  No, he's still alive.
[44:27.720 --> 44:28.060]  Now he's dead.
[44:28.220 --> 44:28.560]  There you go.
[44:32.340 --> 44:33.280]  There's another one coming.
[44:33.640 --> 44:35.520]  Yeah, they're taking a lot of bullets now, these.
[44:36.120 --> 44:36.260]  Yeah.
[44:36.540 --> 44:37.680]  Yeah, they're taking a ton.
[44:41.680 --> 44:42.540]  They're like even in the head.
[44:44.840 --> 44:45.920]  I'm gonna go out and get this.
[44:46.640 --> 44:48.000]  They definitely like to get back up.
[44:48.380 --> 44:48.620]  Yeah.
[44:49.500 --> 44:50.660]  Stay fucking down.
[44:52.780 --> 44:53.040]  Oh!
[44:53.560 --> 44:54.460]  Eric's a fire zombie.
[44:55.100 --> 44:55.960]  No, I'm good. I'm good.
[44:56.440 --> 44:59.880]  I had to go out and get the carbine before it respawned.
[44:59.880 --> 45:01.960]  It came back. I needed the ammo.
[45:03.660 --> 45:04.420]  Nice job, Geoff.
[45:04.440 --> 45:04.920]  Geoff with 28.
[45:05.280 --> 45:05.980]  Yeah, way to go, man.
[45:06.140 --> 45:07.080]  You got the minigun rocking, huh?
[45:07.360 --> 45:07.880]  You got a minigun?
[45:08.020 --> 45:10.040]  I switched from support to offense.
[45:10.360 --> 45:10.520]  Yeah.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.460]  I'm for it.
[45:13.480 --> 45:15.300]  It's just I was getting too overwhelmed without it.
[45:15.500 --> 45:16.720]  Okay, I'm grabbing this health and running back.
[45:17.140 --> 45:17.960]  Don't worry, I'm stuck.
[45:19.680 --> 45:20.100]  Ooh, money.
[45:20.920 --> 45:22.360]  This might be the minigun round for me.
[45:23.600 --> 45:24.460]  Do what you gotta.
[45:25.620 --> 45:26.340]  Got the...
[45:26.800 --> 45:27.480]  Molotov out.
[45:27.580 --> 45:28.540]  See where they spawn from.
[45:29.880 --> 45:31.040]  Spawn from back here.
[45:31.300 --> 45:32.020]  Molotov out.
[45:35.140 --> 45:38.400]  Is this an armored guy or are they rock solid?
[45:38.540 --> 45:39.820]  There's an armored guy behind you.
[45:40.260 --> 45:41.240]  Behind you, Gavin.
[45:41.940 --> 45:42.140]  Shit.
[45:45.670 --> 45:48.050]  He is taking a lot of rounds.
[45:49.630 --> 45:51.170]  Die, you damn mofo.
[45:51.590 --> 45:52.670]  Die, you bitch.
[45:55.570 --> 45:56.710]  Goddamn, he's still up.
[45:57.530 --> 45:59.170]  The armored guys are crazy.
[45:59.510 --> 45:59.990]  Okay, got him.
[45:59.990 --> 46:01.270]  I'm going minigun.
[46:02.310 --> 46:02.990]  It's time.
[46:04.950 --> 46:05.410]  Oops, this is...
[46:06.050 --> 46:06.750]  The Widowmaker.
[46:07.530 --> 46:08.230]  That good as well?
[46:09.610 --> 46:11.150]  If you can get them bunched up, it can be.
[46:12.230 --> 46:13.510]  Oh, balls.
[46:14.630 --> 46:14.970]  Got him.
[46:15.330 --> 46:16.170]  Come on, fire.
[46:16.290 --> 46:17.510]  Oh, there's a shaman right there.
[46:17.790 --> 46:17.990]  Fire.
[46:18.070 --> 46:18.410]  I got him.
[46:22.030 --> 46:22.750]  Come on.
[46:23.350 --> 46:23.710]  Die.
[46:24.010 --> 46:24.330]  Die.
[46:24.730 --> 46:25.210]  He's dead.
[46:25.210 --> 46:25.890]  Yes, we got him.
[46:26.750 --> 46:27.750]  I got the one down here.
[46:28.330 --> 46:29.090]  Or a one down here.
[46:29.090 --> 46:30.530]  It looks like there's another one.
[46:30.910 --> 46:31.210]  A one?
[46:31.390 --> 46:31.910]  There's still...
[46:31.910 --> 46:34.430]  There's still smoke on my screen, at least.
[46:35.910 --> 46:36.230]  Nice.
[46:36.610 --> 46:38.270]  There is more smoke, but I don't know...
[46:38.270 --> 46:39.490]  Like, the shaman might not be there.
[46:39.570 --> 46:40.110]  He's around.
[46:40.310 --> 46:41.250]  I'm going to go and search.
[46:41.750 --> 46:42.710]  Yeah, yeah, we have to.
[46:48.360 --> 46:50.920]  Oh, the blue guy is armored this time.
[46:52.020 --> 46:53.260]  An armored blue flame guy?
[46:53.440 --> 46:54.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:54.100 --> 46:54.420]  Uh-oh.
[46:55.000 --> 46:55.700]  Holy shit.
[46:56.180 --> 46:56.380]  Ow.
[46:58.000 --> 46:58.780]  That's the smoke.
[46:58.880 --> 47:00.240]  Where is this fucking guy?
[47:00.240 --> 47:02.180]  There's some definite bad shit happening.
[47:02.540 --> 47:03.240]  Oh, it's bad.
[47:03.500 --> 47:06.240]  Oh, yeah, that blue guy is armored.
[47:06.800 --> 47:07.640]  Oh, God.
[47:07.820 --> 47:08.780]  Where is the shaman?
[47:09.320 --> 47:09.440]  Run, Gavin, run.
[47:10.960 --> 47:12.080]  They're on my anus.
[47:12.340 --> 47:12.680]  Run.
[47:12.700 --> 47:13.640]  They're on my anus, too.
[47:13.740 --> 47:14.480]  Clinch, Gavin.
[47:16.500 --> 47:16.800]  Ah.
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.380]  Found him, found him.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.140]  Good find.
[47:22.120 --> 47:22.740]  I'll cover you.
[47:27.860 --> 47:28.340]  Died.
[47:28.740 --> 47:29.300]  Nick died.
[47:31.180 --> 47:31.720]  I died, right?
[47:31.800 --> 47:32.780]  Yes, nice job, Eric.
[47:34.640 --> 47:36.600]  Hey, don't... the zombie kicked me.
[47:37.920 --> 47:38.680]  What a prick.
[47:41.600 --> 47:49.940]  Before we kill all the undead, grab ammo, grab health, grab anything that's like here to spawn, and then kill the last of them.
[47:50.040 --> 47:50.900]  Yeah, where's health at?
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.840]  Uh, there's a health on the backside of the church.
[47:54.240 --> 47:54.420]  Yeah.
[47:54.880 --> 47:56.160]  Over by...
[47:56.160 --> 47:57.220]  It's over here.
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.080]  Geoff, if you can just keep running around with that zombie, then we can get all this stuff and then get that.
[48:02.400 --> 48:03.040]  Gavin, it's over here.
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.320]  When Nick respawns, does he respawn with all of his stuff?
[48:07.100 --> 48:07.520]  Everything I have.
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.080]  He'll have the ammo that he had to end the round out, I think.
[48:12.260 --> 48:14.140]  Or to end, like, when he died.
[48:14.500 --> 48:17.520]  So there's no advantage to dying and refilling ammo, right?
[48:17.520 --> 48:19.460]  I don't believe that there is.
[48:19.780 --> 48:23.740]  I run slow with this stupid gun, so it's hard for me to dodge.
[48:23.740 --> 48:27.900]  Why don't you go ahead and kill him? I think I'm ready if Gavin is, so why don't you go ahead and kill him?
[48:28.080 --> 48:28.660]  Ready as shit.
[48:30.460 --> 48:32.360]  Have we been armoring up?
[48:32.540 --> 48:34.740]  Is there armor?
[48:35.440 --> 48:36.780]  I don't know.
[48:37.340 --> 48:38.060]  It just occurred to me.
[48:38.160 --> 48:39.000]  I haven't seen armor.
[48:39.120 --> 48:39.820]  I've been looking around.
[48:40.820 --> 48:42.620]  You access it from holding the back.
[48:42.980 --> 48:44.140]  Oh, I see.
[48:44.320 --> 48:45.860]  I thought there was, like, armor laying.
[48:46.020 --> 48:46.440]  I understand.
[48:47.340 --> 48:48.200]  Health and ammo.
[48:48.660 --> 48:49.400]  Body armor.
[48:49.800 --> 48:50.260]  Oh, fuck.
[48:50.340 --> 48:51.140]  Super heavy armor.
[48:51.440 --> 48:52.880]  Oh, I put on armor.
[48:53.080 --> 48:53.180]  Good thinking.
[48:53.380 --> 48:56.400]  I don't know if it'll actually work or not.
[48:56.560 --> 48:57.520]  It might just be for bullets.
[49:00.340 --> 49:01.520]  Doesn't hurt to try.
[49:05.020 --> 49:05.900]  Let's see.
[49:07.040 --> 49:08.120]  All right, fellas.
[49:08.300 --> 49:10.200]  Right next to us.
[49:11.480 --> 49:12.920]  Backside, Molotov out.
[49:13.220 --> 49:13.780]  Speed pig.
[49:14.880 --> 49:15.560]  Oh, pig!
[49:18.180 --> 49:18.940]  Another pig.
[49:19.300 --> 49:19.720]  Nice.
[49:20.280 --> 49:21.440]  Die, you little piggy.
[49:25.430 --> 49:26.470]  This is a big boar.
[49:31.530 --> 49:32.830]  Okay, so far so good.
[49:32.830 --> 49:33.450]  Feeling good.
[49:37.410 --> 49:38.410]  Molotov out.
[49:39.090 --> 49:40.030]  Molotov out.
[49:44.270 --> 49:46.150]  Oh, we got zombies spawning next to us.
[49:46.410 --> 49:47.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:49.350 --> 49:49.870]  Fireman.
[49:50.810 --> 49:52.710]  Really gotta aim for the head on these guys.
[49:52.890 --> 49:52.990]  Fuck.
[49:53.270 --> 49:53.710]  Yeah, you do.
[49:57.620 --> 49:58.620]  Got that one.
[50:00.940 --> 50:01.460]  Armor.
[50:01.640 --> 50:02.660]  Armor zombies coming up.
[50:03.140 --> 50:03.420]  Okay.
[50:03.920 --> 50:04.620]  Oh, he's on fire.
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.540]  Gavin, look out!
[50:08.080 --> 50:09.140]  Oh, shit, a shaman.
[50:11.060 --> 50:12.280]  Right behind us.
[50:12.660 --> 50:13.600]  I'm opening fire.
[50:14.300 --> 50:15.220]  I'll cover you.
[50:15.340 --> 50:15.940]  You cover me.
[50:16.680 --> 50:18.280]  Oh, balls. It did nothing.
[50:18.500 --> 50:19.200]  It did nothing.
[50:22.780 --> 50:23.460]  I gotta go.
[50:23.920 --> 50:24.960]  Oh, fuck.
[50:26.200 --> 50:27.320]  Oh, I'm on fire again.
[50:27.760 --> 50:29.440]  Stop on the roll, Geoff.
[50:30.320 --> 50:31.440]  Shaman's down, I think.
[50:31.480 --> 50:32.500]  One of them, potentially.
[50:34.640 --> 50:35.980]  I'm stuck in fire.
[50:35.980 --> 50:37.620]  Oh, second one's here. Second one's here. I got him.
[50:37.940 --> 50:38.900]  I got him, I got him.
[50:43.450 --> 50:44.110]  I'm on.
[50:45.690 --> 50:46.490]  Dammit, I missed.
[50:47.550 --> 50:48.530]  Come on, let me through.
[50:48.950 --> 50:49.210]  Fuck.
[50:51.470 --> 50:52.690]  Damn, this slow-ass
[50:52.690 --> 50:54.330]  frickin' running gun bastard.
[50:54.610 --> 50:55.790]  It's so hard to
[50:56.890 --> 50:58.510]  shoot that thing when you're getting
[50:59.210 --> 50:59.650]  punched.
[50:59.830 --> 51:02.010]  There you go, Geoff.
[51:03.030 --> 51:03.870]  There you go.
[51:06.670 --> 51:07.470]  Oh, run, Gavin.
[51:07.770 --> 51:08.330]  I'll cover you.
[51:09.690 --> 51:10.750]  Oh, don't cover me.
[51:10.750 --> 51:11.350]  Is there another shaman?
[51:11.890 --> 51:13.250]  I don't think so. Oh, there might be.
[51:13.310 --> 51:14.190]  How is there more green?
[51:15.190 --> 51:16.190]  It might just be lingering.
[51:17.270 --> 51:19.350]  I don't think it works that way.
[51:19.830 --> 51:22.130]  I don't think it's lingering. I think there's another one
[51:22.130 --> 51:22.470]  somewhere.
[51:29.080 --> 51:29.440]  Fuck.
[51:31.520 --> 51:32.680]  Eat a dick, you little
[51:32.680 --> 51:33.000]  bastard.
[51:35.440 --> 51:36.660]  I don't see any green.
[51:36.660 --> 51:38.160]  We got him.
[51:38.340 --> 51:39.740]  How many waves is it, Nick?
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.280]  I have no idea.
[51:42.700 --> 51:44.680]  We don't have infinite waves on, I saw.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.380]  No, infinite waves is off.
[51:46.560 --> 51:48.580]  Hopefully it's 10.
[51:49.920 --> 51:50.700]  Get that health.
[51:51.660 --> 51:52.480]  Are you serious?
[51:52.680 --> 51:52.800]  No.
[51:56.580 --> 51:59.140]  Is it just one health that spawns, or can everyone get it?
[51:59.520 --> 52:00.980]  There's a few. There's one by the church.
[52:01.120 --> 52:02.900]  There's a couple of healths. I just ate some peas
[52:02.900 --> 52:04.860]  and queues. That's a good call, I'll do that.
[52:06.680 --> 52:08.520]  I minded both my peas and my queue.
[52:09.840 --> 52:10.660]  Ball top out.
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.580]  Oh my god.
[52:15.760 --> 52:16.900]  Is that a... Is that a
[52:16.900 --> 52:18.940]  fucking armored zombie to start?
[52:19.620 --> 52:20.820]  Welcome to hell, baby.
[52:21.100 --> 52:22.240]  Oh my god.
[52:23.540 --> 52:24.820]  What the fuck?
[52:24.960 --> 52:27.040]  Geoff, are you alright? Oh shit, Geoff!
[52:29.400 --> 52:31.140]  I got two armored
[52:31.140 --> 52:32.600]  zombies on me. I can't...
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.340]  They're fucking up my ass.
[52:37.680 --> 52:38.920]  I'm gonna...
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.840]  Hold the line, fellas.
[52:41.540 --> 52:42.280]  I'll cover you.
[52:43.760 --> 52:44.640]  You know what?
[52:46.520 --> 52:46.680]  Oh!
[52:47.060 --> 52:47.240]  Shaman!
[52:49.520 --> 52:51.260]  He's up at the top!
[52:51.760 --> 52:52.600]  Yeah, I see him.
[52:56.300 --> 52:56.920]  Goddamn
[52:56.920 --> 52:58.280]  zombie. I blew myself up.
[52:59.440 --> 52:59.600]  Shit.
[53:01.260 --> 53:02.140]  Nice job.
[53:03.800 --> 53:04.200]  He's dead.
[53:04.200 --> 53:06.640]  Get off me!
[53:06.880 --> 53:08.700]  He's down by me, if you can see my name.
[53:09.080 --> 53:10.020]  He's right by Gavin.
[53:10.200 --> 53:10.840]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[53:11.580 --> 53:13.020]  Right in the middle of that...
[53:14.680 --> 53:16.520]  Geoff, I'm covering you the best I can.
[53:16.820 --> 53:17.480]  Thanks, man.
[53:17.800 --> 53:18.560]  Run, Gavin, run!
[53:20.840 --> 53:21.960]  Oh, Gavin, you gotta run!
[53:26.460 --> 53:28.300]  Come on! One more rocket!
[53:28.440 --> 53:29.360]  Come on, one more rocket!
[53:31.400 --> 53:32.200]  Just fucking
[53:33.080 --> 53:34.060]  die, man.
[53:35.520 --> 53:36.700]  Okay, I'm glad you changed
[53:36.700 --> 53:37.120]  your guns.
[53:37.620 --> 53:40.360]  Yeah, I just wasn't being able to shoot with the other one.
[53:43.240 --> 53:44.640]  Oh, fuck. I might be dead.
[53:45.020 --> 53:45.340]  Okay.
[53:50.240 --> 53:50.900]  Come on.
[53:50.980 --> 53:53.500]  Oh my god. They won't die.
[53:54.060 --> 53:55.000]  I can't kill them.
[53:55.000 --> 53:55.460]  Come on!
[54:01.420 --> 54:02.580]  I cannot get away from these dudes.
[54:02.580 --> 54:03.800]  I died! Fuck!
[54:06.120 --> 54:07.720]  Right where I died, that shaman is.
[54:09.940 --> 54:10.460]  Oh, nice.
[54:12.800 --> 54:13.760]  That was lucky.
[54:15.980 --> 54:18.360]  I killed myself with a fucking...
[54:18.360 --> 54:19.800]  Yeah, but...
[54:19.800 --> 54:21.780]  Hopefully I set a bunch of them on fire.
[54:22.080 --> 54:22.420]  Oh, shit!
[54:23.940 --> 54:24.100]  Oh!
[54:26.000 --> 54:27.420]  Change your gun! Change your gun! Change your gun!
[54:28.180 --> 54:30.040]  Switch your gun, dude. You gotta get out of there.
[54:30.120 --> 54:30.460]  Change your gun.
[54:32.360 --> 54:32.920]  Damn it!
[54:36.540 --> 54:38.260]  Don't run to a corner. You gotta get down.
[54:39.400 --> 54:40.300]  Oh, he's trudging!
[54:40.860 --> 54:41.140]  Deep snow!
[54:42.340 --> 54:43.780]  They just jumped over the ledge!
[54:47.940 --> 54:49.740]  Another fire guy heading straight for you!
[54:51.060 --> 54:51.640]  Damn it!
[54:52.040 --> 54:53.960]  There's shaman to your right. If you can drop a grenade...
[54:53.960 --> 54:56.700]  I think if you get too close to the shaman, you just die.
[54:57.360 --> 54:57.700]  Man!
[54:58.080 --> 54:59.420]  Just get us out of hand!
[55:02.560 --> 55:02.960]  Wow!
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  That's probably still a world best, though, I'm gonna guess.
[55:10.100 --> 55:12.520]  I mean, we can take solace in that, right?
[55:12.840 --> 55:13.560]  We did it!
[55:13.840 --> 55:14.160]  Mostly.
[55:15.160 --> 55:18.280]  This is something for us to work toward. This will be good.
[55:18.740 --> 55:21.240]  I hate weapon wheels.
[55:21.660 --> 55:22.480]  I hate them!
[55:22.740 --> 55:24.060]  I hate them so much.
[55:24.200 --> 55:24.920]  What's the shortcut?
[55:25.280 --> 55:27.380]  I need to learn this.
[55:27.700 --> 55:29.540]  Is it deep?
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.200]  What level are you?
[55:32.240 --> 55:33.280]  He's 131.
[55:33.500 --> 55:33.920]  Okay, cool.
[55:35.720 --> 55:37.660]  I need to learn this.
[55:37.660 --> 55:40.560]  Well, there's a way you can switch weapons without opening the wheel.
[55:40.900 --> 55:43.960]  Because I kept just flicking all around and pulling the minigun out again.
[55:44.320 --> 55:52.760]  You'll have to tune in to the next video we play in GTA Zombie Killer Thing to find out if Gavin figured out the shortcuts.
[55:52.960 --> 56:00.540]  Thanks for tuning in to another thrilling, spooky Let's Play over at the Regulation Gameplay channel.
[56:00.540 --> 56:07.340]  Be sure to check out Regulatreon.com to answer all of life's questions.
[56:07.760 --> 56:09.680]  Nick, go ahead and edit that in so it sounds super cool.
[56:09.960 --> 56:10.720]  We'll see you next time!
[56:11.020 --> 56:12.800]  I never figured it out. I didn't have to switch weapons.
[56:13.260 --> 56:13.660]  Bye!
