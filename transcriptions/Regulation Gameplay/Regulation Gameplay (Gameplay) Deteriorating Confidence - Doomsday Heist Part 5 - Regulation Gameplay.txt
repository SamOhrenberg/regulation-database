[00:00.000 --> 00:04.520]  Hello and welcome to another GTA Doomsday Part 5
[00:06.460 --> 00:07.340]  Oh boy
[00:07.340 --> 00:10.260]  Your confidence went down at the beginning of the video
[00:10.260 --> 00:13.040]  And then you got more confident as 5 went on
[00:13.040 --> 00:14.440]  Yeah, that's not good
[00:15.900 --> 00:19.160]  I'm going to the base, I'm getting ready to initiate the next mission
[00:19.980 --> 00:21.360]  Are you driving to the base?
[00:21.740 --> 00:23.360]  I'm driving there, yeah I'm almost there
[00:23.880 --> 00:25.220]  Why don't you fly ever?
[00:25.680 --> 00:26.580]  He's never gonna fly
[00:26.580 --> 00:28.380]  I don't know how to summon my own helicopter
[00:28.380 --> 00:30.520]  You just spawn it, it's from the menu
[00:30.520 --> 00:31.600]  You're the CEO
[00:32.260 --> 00:33.660]  What buttons do I push?
[00:34.420 --> 00:36.020]  Hold back, secure a serve
[00:36.960 --> 00:37.400]  Vehicles
[00:38.720 --> 00:39.600]  CEO vehicles?
[00:41.320 --> 00:42.980]  Oh, the buzzard
[00:44.460 --> 00:45.340]  $25,000
[00:47.060 --> 00:49.220]  I'm not paying $25,000
[00:49.220 --> 00:50.960]  Well, you have been
[00:51.960 --> 00:53.060]  I've been paying?
[00:53.840 --> 00:56.640]  Wait, I thought you have access to one, so I think you get it for free
[00:56.640 --> 00:57.920]  No, it says $25,000
[00:57.920 --> 00:58.880]  No, I was talking to Gavin
[01:00.020 --> 01:01.880]  Oh, I guess it's free for when I do it
[01:01.880 --> 01:04.160]  Yeah, cause you have it, I don't have one
[01:04.540 --> 01:05.880]  You have access to a buzzard
[01:06.260 --> 01:11.740]  You don't think $25,000 fake dollars is worth all of our time while you drive?
[01:12.960 --> 01:16.120]  You know how long it takes to get $25,000 in this game?
[01:16.720 --> 01:17.580]  You know how we have money?
[01:19.680 --> 01:21.180]  You know who...
[01:21.180 --> 01:23.640]  I mean, there's so many ways you can go about this
[01:23.640 --> 01:25.480]  Our time, we're all getting paid
[01:28.360 --> 01:28.960]  What?
[01:29.400 --> 01:29.600]  What?
[01:30.100 --> 01:33.380]  You're asking me to spend my time
[01:34.640 --> 01:37.540]  No, I'm asking you to spend less of your time
[01:37.540 --> 01:39.280]  And more of our time
[01:39.920 --> 01:40.980]  Time is money
[01:40.980 --> 01:42.060]  Time is money
[01:42.060 --> 01:43.320]  I'm asking you to stop wasting it
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.260]  I get the time and I turn it into the money
[01:46.260 --> 01:47.320]  No, no, no
[01:47.320 --> 01:47.540]  What?
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.920]  Yeah, and then...
[01:51.240 --> 01:53.920]  And then it becomes Jekyll's
[01:57.920 --> 02:00.160]  Your gun at your car has guns? What's this?
[02:00.400 --> 02:01.900]  I don't know whose car this is
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.920]  Is it a CEO car?
[02:05.480 --> 02:05.920]  Aha!
[02:06.880 --> 02:07.320]  Maybe
[02:08.400 --> 02:09.740]  Oh, this is amazing
[02:09.740 --> 02:10.800]  Am I in the lookout team?
[02:10.860 --> 02:13.260]  Alright, Gavin, are we ground team?
[02:13.700 --> 02:14.060]  Sure
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.480]  What do you think?
[02:19.540 --> 02:20.520]  Oh, I like that
[02:20.520 --> 02:22.300]  You kinda look like Shredder a little bit
[02:22.300 --> 02:24.380]  You wanna do high tech or do you wanna do mid tech?
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.040]  I think we do high tech, right?
[02:26.380 --> 02:26.960]  High tech
[02:28.660 --> 02:29.100]  Engineered?
[02:30.520 --> 02:32.340]  Yeah, I think engineered is it
[02:32.340 --> 02:33.180]  I think we're good
[02:34.880 --> 02:35.680]  Let's do it
[02:35.680 --> 02:36.380]  I'm ready
[02:40.530 --> 02:41.870]  Oh, we're in the facility again
[02:44.010 --> 02:45.210]  The one I paid for
[02:47.070 --> 02:49.170]  Why'd you do that? I think how many buzzards you could've gotten
[02:49.170 --> 02:50.770]  Oh shit, good point
[02:51.810 --> 02:53.210]  Or the weekend you could've had
[02:57.800 --> 02:59.280]  It's still snowing
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.760]  I don't...
[03:05.380 --> 03:06.540]  It's just crazy
[03:06.540 --> 03:11.320]  I need to get Gavin to give me a list of priorities for how I spend the money
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.780]  What is in his order of importance? Is buzzard the next thing?
[03:17.500 --> 03:17.820]  What do you mean?
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.220]  Access to buzzard is probably pretty important
[03:19.220 --> 03:20.680]  Wait, Gavin, we both can't take that
[03:20.680 --> 03:21.500]  That's true
[03:22.040 --> 03:23.240]  Alright, pick your own
[03:25.480 --> 03:25.920]  Alright
[03:27.880 --> 03:28.480]  Hop in
[03:34.440 --> 03:34.980]  Alright
[03:34.980 --> 03:35.220]  Oh no
[03:40.520 --> 03:42.640]  Alright, I don't think I remember what this is
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.420]  We gotta help the UAP or whatever
[03:48.780 --> 03:49.600]  Hey, Andrew
[03:49.600 --> 03:50.740]  Hey, Nick
[03:50.740 --> 03:51.860]  Is that your car?
[03:52.560 --> 03:53.100]  No
[03:54.500 --> 03:55.040]  Maybe?
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.000]  I took it
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.480]  Who has the armored car that has the guns built into it?
[04:01.380 --> 04:02.060]  It might've been mine
[04:02.060 --> 04:02.900]  Oh, okay
[04:05.060 --> 04:08.720]  Although before today you only would've driven it once until it exploded and never driven again
[04:08.720 --> 04:14.780]  Oh, I think the reason I got it back is because I did the insurance claim on it
[04:14.780 --> 04:15.080]  Yeah
[04:15.660 --> 04:17.140]  It's the only reason I have it
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.700]  I had like four destroyed cars
[04:22.620 --> 04:25.000]  I just never... beats me
[04:27.480 --> 04:28.420]  Insurance, who needs it?
[04:29.040 --> 04:30.840]  It might be my least favorite mechanic in the game
[04:31.380 --> 04:31.740]  Really?
[04:32.820 --> 04:35.020]  Yeah, just give me the car back
[04:35.020 --> 04:37.340]  It's a pretend video game, just give me the car back
[04:37.340 --> 04:38.060]  Who gives a shit?
[04:38.460 --> 04:39.160]  Like, who cares?
[04:39.440 --> 04:42.740]  Just give me the... it's the toy I wanna play with
[04:42.740 --> 04:44.140]  Let me play with the toy
[04:44.140 --> 04:45.340]  Like, fuck off
[04:46.860 --> 04:47.900]  Insurance in the video?
[04:47.960 --> 04:50.740]  We need to deal with insurance in the video game?
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.160]  Get fucking real
[04:52.160 --> 04:52.940]  Yeah, I don't wanna...
[04:52.940 --> 04:55.000]  Are you sure you don't wanna deposit your money to the bank?
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.220]  Yeah, dude, that... it's like...
[04:57.600 --> 05:02.720]  This was definitely a game that came out in an era where it's like, oh my god, we're gonna do like the most realistic stuff
[05:02.720 --> 05:03.720]  And it's like, oh, is it fun?
[05:03.980 --> 05:04.580]  Oh, Nick
[05:04.580 --> 05:05.080]  No
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.960]  No, it's really not a priority
[05:07.960 --> 05:08.480]  Let me catch up
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.580]  The fun doesn't matter
[05:11.180 --> 05:14.580]  Yeah, if they went all in on that, I would've done 11 tax returns in this game
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.840]  It's just like, man, come on
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.320]  Are you still in a snow environment, Nick?
[05:25.000 --> 05:25.380]  Yeah
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.080]  Can you pick up snowballs?
[05:28.860 --> 05:30.600]  Oh, I don't know, I'll find out when I park
[05:34.920 --> 05:36.800]  Nick is gonna have a one-man snowball fight
[05:36.800 --> 05:40.800]  Nick, you should try and get through this whole mission only throwing snowballs
[05:40.800 --> 05:42.200]  That none of us can see
[05:43.740 --> 05:45.700]  Oh, that's an interesting... I wonder what it'll look...
[05:46.360 --> 05:47.380]  What it'll look like
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.920]  Oh, shit, Nick
[05:49.920 --> 05:51.740]  Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick
[05:51.740 --> 05:52.280]  That's me
[05:53.820 --> 05:55.060]  Fox is here!
[05:55.200 --> 05:55.580]  Ow
[05:57.860 --> 06:02.180]  I don't... He's latched onto the fox thing, and it is, like, just not right
[06:02.180 --> 06:03.080]  Too late
[06:03.080 --> 06:05.540]  It's, like, not the right animal for him
[06:06.520 --> 06:08.840]  What does the fox say? Jalapenos
[06:09.940 --> 06:10.820]  Yo, jalapenos
[06:15.320 --> 06:17.700]  Oh, you nailed it. How did you do that?
[06:18.200 --> 06:19.600]  Into the vantage point
[06:21.400 --> 06:22.860]  We're really bad at looking out
[06:22.860 --> 06:24.900]  We're almost to where we need to go
[06:24.900 --> 06:26.280]  Oh, that was awesome, Nick
[06:26.560 --> 06:27.060]  Good hit
[06:27.060 --> 06:28.360]  Thank you. He's alive, though
[06:28.360 --> 06:29.480]  Take out the agents
[06:32.460 --> 06:33.160]  Okay, we're here
[06:35.100 --> 06:36.080]  Wow, that was brutal
[06:37.260 --> 06:39.260]  Oh, shit. Why is the alarm going off?
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.920]  Uh, some things went badly
[06:42.300 --> 06:44.300]  Who are these other men? Are these to help?
[06:44.440 --> 06:45.200]  All right, we... Oh, God
[06:45.200 --> 06:46.680]  What the? Where'd they come from?
[06:46.820 --> 06:47.360]  Did we like that?
[06:47.500 --> 06:47.680]  Go, run!
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.100]  Did they just spawn in?
[06:50.440 --> 06:50.960]  No, they drove
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.780]  They drove up in that truck
[06:51.780 --> 06:52.880]  Oh, I didn't even see them. How weird
[06:52.880 --> 06:54.240]  We're right next to the tree
[06:54.240 --> 06:56.000]  I didn't even see them. I didn't see it happen
[06:56.400 --> 06:58.080]  All right, Gavin, let's go into the foundry
[06:58.620 --> 06:58.940]  Okay
[06:59.580 --> 06:59.900]  Oops
[07:02.060 --> 07:02.980]  Where's the chopper?
[07:04.840 --> 07:06.300]  Wow, a lot of guys in the foundry
[07:06.940 --> 07:07.260]  Coming
[07:07.260 --> 07:08.840]  A lot of guys. A lot. So many
[07:08.840 --> 07:10.340]  We got the ones outside
[07:11.820 --> 07:12.360]  For now
[07:13.300 --> 07:14.160]  I got that one in
[07:15.660 --> 07:15.980]  Okay
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.540]  Are the stairs on the inside?
[07:21.340 --> 07:21.600]  Yeah
[07:21.980 --> 07:22.620]  Nice shot
[07:22.620 --> 07:23.340]  Thank you
[07:23.340 --> 07:24.740]  Where are you? Are you up these stairs?
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.460]  I climbed up a tower
[07:27.440 --> 07:28.000]  Huh
[07:29.900 --> 07:32.160]  Oh my god, Gavin, what the fuck?
[07:32.320 --> 07:32.860]  Hey, what's up?
[07:33.160 --> 07:33.860]  What are we doing?
[07:34.920 --> 07:35.940]  Killing everything
[07:35.940 --> 07:36.860]  Is that a window?
[07:37.740 --> 07:38.120]  Yeah
[07:39.820 --> 07:40.720]  I didn't worry
[07:40.720 --> 07:41.600]  Oh my god!
[07:47.070 --> 07:47.630]  Nice
[07:48.970 --> 07:49.530]  Nice
[07:50.050 --> 07:50.830]  There you go
[07:52.750 --> 07:53.610]  No mercy
[07:55.190 --> 07:55.990]  All right
[07:55.990 --> 07:57.490]  Let's move
[08:00.370 --> 08:01.210]  You got him?
[08:01.210 --> 08:01.330]  Oh shit!
[08:05.280 --> 08:06.200]  How are you doing? You all right?
[08:06.440 --> 08:07.040]  Yeah, I'm fine
[08:08.080 --> 08:10.460]  Trying my best to provide cover
[08:11.200 --> 08:11.600]  Fuck
[08:12.140 --> 08:12.820]  Injured pant died
[08:12.820 --> 08:13.600]  Oh
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.360]  Gavin, do it again
[08:15.820 --> 08:16.400]  All right
[08:17.380 --> 08:18.360]  Sorry about that
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.180]  No, you're all right
[08:21.540 --> 08:24.680]  Are you guys just like holding it down outside and guys keep showing up or what?
[08:24.720 --> 08:25.040]  Yeah
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.460]  Yeah, it's so many guys
[08:26.460 --> 08:27.860]  We'll try to be faster
[08:27.860 --> 08:30.060]  There's just a lot of dudes in here
[08:30.060 --> 08:32.080]  And like it's such a...
[08:32.080 --> 08:35.180]  Everywhere you go inside this place is just such like a tight squeeze
[08:35.180 --> 08:36.040]  It's hard to...
[08:36.040 --> 08:36.480]  Yeah, no problem
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.100]  It's hard to maneuver
[08:37.620 --> 08:39.220]  Dude, you are...
[08:39.220 --> 08:39.740]  Okay
[08:41.220 --> 08:42.560]  Get back in position
[08:43.840 --> 08:46.000]  It's just awkward because it's like they're...
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.240]  The angle of this tower, I can't look down to shoot him
[08:49.240 --> 08:50.860]  So I have to like try to adjust
[08:52.140 --> 08:53.100]  Where are...
[08:53.100 --> 08:54.260]  Oh, okay, I guess we're just...
[08:55.440 --> 08:55.920]  Hello!
[08:57.180 --> 09:04.360]  Yeah, when they first pulled up in their truck, it didn't have any markers on them on the map for me
[09:04.360 --> 09:05.020]  That's...
[09:05.020 --> 09:05.840]  That's what I'm saying
[09:05.840 --> 09:08.180]  Like I thought that they just spawned in
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.520]  All right
[09:14.040 --> 09:14.680]  Me and you, Gavin
[09:15.540 --> 09:16.200]  Let's do it
[09:16.200 --> 09:19.440]  Yeah, let's do it
[09:22.120 --> 09:29.040]  Oh, that tower
[09:30.880 --> 09:31.400]  Interesting
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.900]  Watch your health, just watch your health
[09:33.820 --> 09:34.960]  Oh, shit
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.400]  Why is it sending me back down?
[09:41.140 --> 09:41.580]  Good
[09:42.980 --> 09:44.240]  There's that guy
[09:46.980 --> 09:48.180]  Down, down
[09:49.840 --> 09:51.380]  Oh, I like that
[09:52.540 --> 09:55.420]  They just knocked it off like it was nothing
[09:57.180 --> 09:59.660]  Oh, not that time they didn't
[09:59.660 --> 10:00.660]  Another helicopter
[10:02.660 --> 10:04.400]  I'm just trying to pull up, do headshots
[10:07.160 --> 10:09.020]  All right, I think we can move up
[10:10.400 --> 10:10.820]  Oh
[10:15.200 --> 10:15.840]  Oh, shit
[10:18.380 --> 10:18.920]  Helicopter's down
[10:18.920 --> 10:19.720]  Nice shot
[10:22.340 --> 10:23.020]  I fell
[10:23.020 --> 10:24.150]  I don't know what happened
[10:26.260 --> 10:27.540]  Did you see me trip?
[10:28.080 --> 10:30.160]  No, I was reloading my armor
[10:30.160 --> 10:32.000]  I was just rolling on the floor
[10:37.370 --> 10:37.810]  Where are they?
[10:37.930 --> 10:38.190]  They're there
[10:38.190 --> 10:38.970]  Got them
[10:38.970 --> 10:39.810]  Where are they?
[10:40.810 --> 10:41.610]  They're like...
[10:41.610 --> 10:42.570]  Oh, they're there
[10:42.570 --> 10:45.210]  They're low, but such an annoying angle
[10:46.610 --> 10:47.010]  Yeah
[10:52.970 --> 10:53.930]  Oh, chopper incoming
[10:53.930 --> 10:54.290]  Yeah, oh
[10:54.810 --> 10:55.570]  Who's that guy?
[10:55.930 --> 10:56.510]  Oh, is it Ulf?
[10:56.850 --> 10:57.810]  Yeah, I did it
[10:58.330 --> 10:58.930]  Nice, Nick
[10:59.390 --> 11:00.170]  Thank you
[11:00.170 --> 11:01.910]  Another helicopter coming in on the other side
[11:01.910 --> 11:02.730]  Clear the path
[11:02.730 --> 11:03.150]  Okay
[11:03.150 --> 11:05.050]  Wait, did he just run ahead?
[11:05.190 --> 11:06.310]  Yeah, he's going for it
[11:06.310 --> 11:07.290]  He's going for it
[11:07.290 --> 11:07.530]  What?
[11:07.930 --> 11:08.810]  Watch out, dude
[11:09.330 --> 11:10.310]  Oh, he's got a gun, never mind
[11:10.310 --> 11:11.690]  Oh my god
[11:15.800 --> 11:18.600]  We have people coming all over the place
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.540]  Is this guy's voice Bender from Futurama?
[11:26.540 --> 11:27.400]  Marcus Fenix?
[11:28.780 --> 11:31.220]  That's what it sounds like
[11:36.200 --> 11:37.140]  Alright, are we going down?
[11:37.900 --> 11:38.680]  I guess so
[11:38.680 --> 11:39.320]  Chopper
[11:41.060 --> 11:42.160]  You should probably...
[11:42.160 --> 11:43.080]  Oh, just stay with him
[11:43.080 --> 11:43.960]  Please don't die right here
[11:43.960 --> 11:44.740]  Oh god
[11:46.500 --> 11:48.740]  I didn't realize there was such a drop below me
[11:50.460 --> 11:51.880]  That Rayleigh really helped me out
[11:51.880 --> 11:52.740]  Oh shit
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.120]  I don't know where this guy is
[11:54.120 --> 11:55.160]  He's behind you
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.980]  Oh, I couldn't see him
[11:56.980 --> 11:58.640]  Why don't you know where anyone is?
[11:58.960 --> 11:59.480]  I don't know
[11:59.480 --> 12:01.360]  If you're behind me, you're invisible
[12:01.360 --> 12:02.720]  Look on the map
[12:03.460 --> 12:04.500]  Watch like a rabbit
[12:08.290 --> 12:09.970]  Fine, Jesus Christ
[12:11.030 --> 12:11.710]  He'll come back
[12:12.230 --> 12:12.670]  Okay
[12:14.310 --> 12:17.130]  Okay, we're coming outside right now with the...
[12:18.190 --> 12:18.630]  Okay
[12:19.690 --> 12:20.610]  Die, mothers!
[12:26.530 --> 12:27.550]  Oh shit, Eric
[12:27.550 --> 12:28.970]  Wow, that was really close
[12:30.430 --> 12:31.490]  Nice shot, Andrew
[12:31.490 --> 12:32.230]  Thank you
[12:35.190 --> 12:35.630]  Okay
[12:35.630 --> 12:35.990]  There is?
[12:36.230 --> 12:36.990]  Let's go get it
[12:38.490 --> 12:39.290]  Where is it?
[12:39.790 --> 12:40.650]  Coming down the ladders
[12:41.270 --> 12:42.890]  They may have all been blown up
[12:44.230 --> 12:44.670]  Well...
[12:51.470 --> 12:53.070]  What are we supposed to use?
[12:53.610 --> 12:54.490]  Over here, maybe
[12:54.490 --> 12:56.210]  I see a car
[12:57.130 --> 12:58.510]  I got an armored...
[12:59.590 --> 13:00.530]  How do I get on the turret?
[13:00.530 --> 13:00.990]  Oh, here we go
[13:01.510 --> 13:03.150]  Alright, Nick's got it
[13:03.150 --> 13:04.470]  I guess I'll just sit on the back
[13:04.470 --> 13:05.670]  Oh, Gavin in the back
[13:08.570 --> 13:10.030]  I think you're in the turret, Eric
[13:10.030 --> 13:11.270]  I am
[13:11.890 --> 13:12.330]  Alright
[13:13.070 --> 13:14.510]  Alright, Andrew's running interference
[13:15.990 --> 13:17.510]  And Gavin is spotter
[13:17.510 --> 13:19.130]  There's still room in this car
[13:19.810 --> 13:20.710]  Do you know what I mean?
[13:20.850 --> 13:23.030]  I'll just take this, because this one is a built-in machine gun
[13:23.030 --> 13:23.850]  So, I can help
[13:24.830 --> 13:25.190]  Okay
[13:28.010 --> 13:29.690]  Yeah, right in that pole, good help
[13:33.030 --> 13:33.390]  Witnesses!
[13:34.330 --> 13:35.810]  Nick's gonna get the cops after us
[13:35.810 --> 13:36.550]  This is really good
[13:36.550 --> 13:39.010]  Do you guys want to do this mission again?
[13:39.910 --> 13:40.270]  No
[13:41.270 --> 13:41.630]  Okay
[13:43.110 --> 13:43.470]  Straight ahead
[13:43.470 --> 13:45.150]  I think the fox has it figured out
[13:45.890 --> 13:46.610]  He's something
[13:46.610 --> 13:47.670]  Listen, fox is clever
[13:48.990 --> 13:51.010]  Listen, fox clever
[13:52.130 --> 13:54.090]  Listen, fox clever
[13:54.090 --> 13:55.250]  Listen here, rat
[13:58.710 --> 13:59.930]  Here comes one ahead
[13:59.930 --> 14:00.450]  Gavin
[14:01.130 --> 14:01.710]  What's up?
[14:02.630 --> 14:04.570]  Gavin's throwing bombs at me
[14:05.110 --> 14:05.650]  At you?
[14:06.270 --> 14:07.250]  I'm behind you
[14:07.250 --> 14:08.270]  He's right behind us
[14:08.270 --> 14:09.250]  Oh, it's you
[14:09.250 --> 14:10.810]  How come you don't know where anyone is?
[14:11.370 --> 14:13.470]  Well, the enemies are in the same car
[14:18.170 --> 14:19.010]  Andrew, don't back up!
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.460]  Your arrow goes away
[14:26.460 --> 14:28.820]  And it makes it really confusing
[14:28.820 --> 14:30.980]  I thought you were doing a bit
[14:30.980 --> 14:32.260]  Where you're purposely missing
[14:32.260 --> 14:33.600]  No, I'm that stupid
[14:33.600 --> 14:34.340]  You just weren't good
[14:34.340 --> 14:34.580]  Wow!
[14:34.840 --> 14:35.660]  What a shot
[14:35.660 --> 14:36.320]  Nice
[14:45.080 --> 14:47.020]  At least the drop-off is halfway
[14:47.020 --> 14:48.540]  Assuming it's at the facility
[14:52.800 --> 14:53.620]  Coming up
[14:56.790 --> 14:58.090]  Oh my god
[14:58.670 --> 14:59.210]  Jesus
[14:59.210 --> 14:59.870]  Wow!
[15:00.450 --> 15:01.110]  Holy shit!
[15:02.010 --> 15:03.010]  Now, one of those is Andrew
[15:03.010 --> 15:03.930]  Nice
[15:03.930 --> 15:04.090]  Oh, right
[15:04.090 --> 15:05.270]  There you go
[15:05.270 --> 15:06.630]  He dived down
[15:07.370 --> 15:08.370]  That was awesome
[15:08.370 --> 15:09.450]  Oh, dude
[15:09.450 --> 15:10.550]  Good driving, Nick
[15:10.550 --> 15:11.430]  Thank you
[15:14.630 --> 15:26.310]  I mean, there's just nothing you can do about that
[15:27.570 --> 15:28.010]  Wow!
[15:28.430 --> 15:29.170]  Oh, shit
[15:30.970 --> 15:33.770]  I'll try not to shoot at guys right in front of us
[15:34.290 --> 15:34.950]  That's alright
[15:34.950 --> 15:36.310]  That seemed to get pretty...
[15:38.190 --> 15:38.630]  Wow
[15:38.630 --> 15:39.690]  Did that go on us?
[15:43.750 --> 15:45.170]  I got arrows in the chopper
[15:45.170 --> 15:45.730]  Yeah, I see
[15:49.760 --> 15:51.140]  What the fuck?
[15:51.160 --> 15:52.380]  Oh my god!
[15:54.180 --> 15:56.260]  Hey, now, do you think that...
[15:56.260 --> 15:59.840]  Did somebody throw a proximity mine or a bomb or something?
[15:59.960 --> 16:02.480]  I threw one, but I didn't trigger it
[16:02.480 --> 16:02.920]  Uh-huh
[16:02.920 --> 16:05.020]  And where do you think it ended up?
[16:06.680 --> 16:09.040]  Did it end up in one of your bullets?
[16:09.660 --> 16:11.680]  He did that last time too
[16:11.680 --> 16:14.880]  Do you think maybe it was on the car and then the bomb got shot?
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.560]  Do you think maybe he threw the bomb in front of your bullet?
[16:19.980 --> 16:20.860]  I wasn't shooting
[16:20.860 --> 16:22.440]  The helicopter was shooting
[16:22.440 --> 16:23.120]  Oh, okay
[16:23.680 --> 16:24.120]  Oh
[16:24.660 --> 16:25.100]  So
[16:25.100 --> 16:26.340]  The helicopter shot their own guy?
[16:26.900 --> 16:28.000]  Just a real quick question
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.340]  Do you guys want to do this mission again?
[16:29.580 --> 16:31.280]  You got to retrieve him again, I think
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.720]  I don't know
[16:33.420 --> 16:34.940]  No, look, we're inside the facility
[16:34.940 --> 16:35.540]  See?
[16:36.580 --> 16:38.040]  There he is
[16:38.040 --> 16:39.100]  Alright, so should we just...
[16:39.940 --> 16:40.700]  Not use bombs?
[16:41.640 --> 16:41.820]  Yeah
[16:41.820 --> 16:43.500]  Yeah, I don't know why we're using bombs at all
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.820]  I don't know, I mean...
[16:44.820 --> 16:45.420]  They blow shit up
[16:46.000 --> 16:47.540]  Yeah, they blew us up, you're right
[16:47.540 --> 16:48.500]  100% Gavin
[16:49.020 --> 16:49.380]  Absolutely
[16:49.380 --> 16:50.700]  They did, they blew us up
[16:50.700 --> 16:51.820]  You're 100% right
[16:55.160 --> 16:55.900]  Why'd you do that, Gavin?
[16:56.760 --> 16:57.880]  Yeah, that's who did it
[16:57.880 --> 17:00.720]  Well, it could've been me, I was also throwing them
[17:01.880 --> 17:03.880]  Were you throwing C-bombs or what were they?
[17:04.260 --> 17:04.580]  Yeah, they're stickers
[17:04.580 --> 17:05.820]  Yeah, he was throwing sticky bombs
[17:08.060 --> 17:10.540]  One of them definitely got attached to the car and shot by the helicopter
[17:10.980 --> 17:11.300]  Yep
[17:11.660 --> 17:13.100]  No, it was the car ahead of us
[17:19.400 --> 17:19.720]  Anyway
[17:20.460 --> 17:20.780]  Anyway
[17:22.060 --> 17:24.860]  That's alright, we're having a nice drive together
[17:26.500 --> 17:26.820]  Ow
[17:30.380 --> 17:31.140]  Got a nice drive
[17:31.140 --> 17:33.260]  There might be time and a place for the bombs
[17:33.760 --> 17:37.020]  Yeah, it's just not what we're all in the same car, I think
[17:37.020 --> 17:38.440]  With zero team lives
[17:38.440 --> 17:39.620]  Well, we weren't all in the same car
[17:40.300 --> 17:41.580]  With zero team lives
[17:42.060 --> 17:45.540]  I think that's why we were doing it, it's because Andrew was off on his own and we were just trying to help him
[17:45.540 --> 17:47.000]  Yeah, Andrew, I can't believe that
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.840]  No, we were trying to help him, I don't blame Andrew
[17:49.840 --> 17:51.040]  More than anything, this is Andrew's fault
[17:51.420 --> 17:54.220]  No, that's not what I said, I said we were trying to help Andrew
[17:54.640 --> 17:56.320]  It's what you implied, but it's not what you said
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.040]  Gavin wasn't trying to help him
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.200]  No, I was trying to kill him for the first half because I thought he was a bad guy
[18:01.940 --> 18:04.740]  Right, but once he realized, he redoubled his efforts
[18:06.320 --> 18:08.640]  And started throwing them around him instead of at him
[18:08.640 --> 18:09.700]  Yeah, I went double a double
[18:09.700 --> 18:13.280]  We got on the freeway so much faster this time
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.340]  Yeah, I was about to say, I feel like we're doing so much better
[18:15.340 --> 18:16.500]  Well, you didn't hit that pole
[18:17.420 --> 18:18.040]  It's true
[18:19.580 --> 18:19.940]  Who?
[18:20.460 --> 18:21.060]  Whoever's driving
[18:21.840 --> 18:22.680]  Yeah, who's driving?
[18:24.320 --> 18:25.460]  I assume it's Nick?
[18:25.900 --> 18:26.660]  Me, I'm driving
[18:26.660 --> 18:29.460]  Okay, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
[18:30.300 --> 18:31.540]  Oh, oh look, that blew up
[18:33.180 --> 18:35.480]  Did we have a bomb attached to us?
[18:35.980 --> 18:37.340]  That was attached to them!
[18:37.840 --> 18:38.820]  What point are you making?
[18:39.440 --> 18:41.100]  That it blew up and we survived
[18:42.100 --> 18:44.880]  Do you think that's the point any of us were making before?
[18:45.400 --> 18:46.420]  That's the point I'm making
[18:47.020 --> 18:48.700]  Oh my god
[18:50.480 --> 18:52.320]  Nick would be so bad at a court
[18:52.320 --> 18:53.840]  Like, everyone would be like, yeah
[18:55.180 --> 18:56.500]  He's arguing against you
[18:56.500 --> 18:58.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've talked about that before
[18:58.480 --> 18:59.880]  Where Nick is, it's pure permission
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.660]  He's just looking for, kind of like, tacit approval to do something
[19:04.660 --> 19:09.760]  But also, when the chips are down, he'll just agree with you whether you're with him or not
[19:10.260 --> 19:11.760]  No, that's not true
[19:13.580 --> 19:15.120]  I just disagree with you now
[19:15.840 --> 19:18.120]  So, have you ever been on jury duty, Nick?
[19:18.940 --> 19:20.120]  Yeah, but I wasn't selected
[19:25.280 --> 19:25.760]  Helicopter's down
[19:29.920 --> 19:31.140]  How'd you get out of it?
[19:31.260 --> 19:32.620]  You just legit one-pick?
[19:33.820 --> 19:35.180]  Yeah, just legit not-pick
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.880]  You didn't even have to act crazy
[19:37.880 --> 19:41.000]  I ate tuna for lunch, hoping that maybe they'd be like, that guy smells, whatever
[19:43.220 --> 19:44.440]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[19:45.720 --> 19:48.040]  The helicopter's right above us, right where I can't shoot him
[19:48.040 --> 19:48.600]  There we go
[19:48.600 --> 19:50.520]  Yeah, I'll get you in spot
[19:51.160 --> 19:52.600]  I'm just trying to stay alive
[19:52.600 --> 19:54.060]  You're doing great
[19:55.140 --> 19:56.040]  Got him
[19:56.880 --> 19:57.700]  Helicopter's down
[19:58.480 --> 19:59.080]  Nice shooting
[20:04.630 --> 20:05.730]  We're almost there
[20:06.230 --> 20:08.150]  We almost did it
[20:11.980 --> 20:14.120]  Whoa! That was crazy
[20:14.120 --> 20:16.260]  That was just a regular dude
[20:17.280 --> 20:19.580]  That might have been the biggest obstacle of the whole bit
[20:19.580 --> 20:20.080]  No!
[20:24.180 --> 20:25.000]  Here we go
[20:29.710 --> 20:30.150]  Alright
[20:30.150 --> 20:32.350]  Oh, we're delivering it, like, way past the bunker
[20:35.070 --> 20:35.510]  Whoops
[20:38.210 --> 20:39.350]  We got this, fellas
[20:43.830 --> 20:46.470]  I don't think anyone threw a bomb, so I believe in us
[20:46.470 --> 20:46.730]  Yeah
[20:50.980 --> 20:53.000]  No! No! I wanted it!
[20:53.040 --> 20:53.680]  I wanted it!
[20:54.860 --> 20:55.180]  Oh!
[20:55.880 --> 20:56.700]  Oh, here we go
[20:57.060 --> 20:57.380]  Oh!
[20:58.680 --> 21:01.520]  Oh, you kept him for a bit, that was good
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.660]  Oh, I ranked up for that
[21:03.040 --> 21:04.200]  He got to rest up
[21:06.480 --> 21:07.180]  Get rid of him!
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.320]  Now, I do want to pre-warn you, I will be diving out the back of this right as we get to the delivery
[21:11.680 --> 21:12.420]  Oh, okay, fine
[21:13.420 --> 21:13.740]  Sweet
[21:14.280 --> 21:16.560]  I look forward to seeing that
[21:18.220 --> 21:19.260]  Cool, I think we did it
[21:19.260 --> 21:20.860]  The Russian's bailed!
[21:22.940 --> 21:23.360]  Oh!
[21:24.120 --> 21:24.540]  Oh!
[21:27.120 --> 21:28.260]  Was that for style?
[21:31.660 --> 21:32.080]  Gavin?
[21:32.280 --> 21:32.460]  Yeah
[21:33.540 --> 21:35.720]  Oh, our guy fell out, too
[21:37.280 --> 21:38.420]  Oh, I don't want to get in that
[21:39.180 --> 21:39.600]  No!
[21:40.240 --> 21:41.400]  He's in the back!
[21:42.940 --> 21:43.500]  What's it?
[21:44.000 --> 21:44.760]  Oh, why is he getting out?
[21:45.420 --> 21:47.820]  Get in the car, you moron!
[21:47.820 --> 21:48.700]  Not you, Gavin, him
[21:48.700 --> 21:51.800]  I mean, you could definitely say that to Gavin
[21:51.800 --> 21:53.520]  It's fine
[21:53.520 --> 21:54.620]  Alright, I'm just getting in
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.160]  Oh, God! Get in, dude!
[21:57.260 --> 21:59.660]  I wanted to be in the back with him
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.020]  I just don't know why I couldn't do it
[22:01.020 --> 22:03.820]  He's like, I heard you talking about pool diving
[22:03.820 --> 22:05.540]  And I want to be able to do it
[22:06.640 --> 22:08.220]  I want to be stylish
[22:08.820 --> 22:10.700]  He heard you whispering from outside the window
[22:10.700 --> 22:11.420]  So he got out
[22:13.260 --> 22:14.660]  Oh, remember this place?
[22:15.400 --> 22:15.680]  Yeah
[22:15.680 --> 22:17.820]  Oh, we spent so much time here
[22:23.780 --> 22:25.220]  He did the same
[22:25.220 --> 22:27.380]  You guys coordinated swan diving
[22:27.380 --> 22:28.500]  He loves me
[22:31.320 --> 22:32.640]  We did it
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.700]  I mean, they're going to call you, Eric
[22:41.500 --> 22:41.980]  Oh!
[22:43.020 --> 22:44.160]  We did it!
[22:44.160 --> 22:45.120]  Yeah!
[22:48.740 --> 22:49.820]  First time!
[22:52.240 --> 22:52.780]  Charmers
[22:54.820 --> 22:56.060]  Take that, Funhaus
[22:56.660 --> 22:58.460]  Yeah, we got you
[23:00.260 --> 23:02.840]  I'm just noticing that I'm clumsy by a little bit
[23:02.840 --> 23:04.440]  How do I increase my clumsy rating?
[23:05.660 --> 23:06.980]  How do you get more clumsy?
[23:07.360 --> 23:07.900]  Close the window
[23:07.900 --> 23:08.340]  Alright
[23:11.840 --> 23:13.880]  I don't think I can swap teams
[23:14.900 --> 23:17.240]  How do I swap teams?
[23:18.760 --> 23:20.000]  Oh, I don't think we can
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.500]  Oh, I think it's classic
[23:22.160 --> 23:23.260]  Gandrew Panton
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.220]  And I'm with Nick
[23:26.220 --> 23:28.040]  It's 100% E
[23:28.040 --> 23:29.300]  100% E
[23:29.300 --> 23:30.440]  50% E
[23:31.620 --> 23:33.000]  This is 50% E
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.080]  That's pretty good
[23:36.240 --> 23:37.240]  Let's do this
[23:37.240 --> 23:37.500]  Let's do this shit
[23:39.900 --> 23:40.820]  I'm hungry
[23:41.940 --> 23:43.160]  Not a surprise
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.420]  For justice
[23:44.420 --> 23:46.060]  That is a surprise
[23:48.260 --> 23:50.320]  I'm going to stop for a snack along the way
[23:50.320 --> 23:53.160]  What type of sauce do you put on justice?
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.700]  Spiciest you got
[24:01.260 --> 24:02.700]  Sauce on justice
[24:02.700 --> 24:03.380]  Oh
[24:04.800 --> 24:06.200]  Are we all in the same thing?
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.620]  Hell yeah, let's do it
[24:08.620 --> 24:08.960]  No
[24:16.380 --> 24:17.420]  Hell yeah
[24:18.700 --> 24:20.860]  I remember when we stole this the other day
[24:28.900 --> 24:30.440]  Isn't this place in a drought?
[24:32.120 --> 24:33.300]  I'll save you
[24:33.300 --> 24:35.060]  You can fix it
[24:37.720 --> 24:38.340]  There's a lot of water coming
[24:48.240 --> 24:49.220]  Kill those guys
[24:49.220 --> 24:49.580]  Kill them
[24:51.560 --> 24:51.960]  Bicyclists
[24:53.720 --> 24:55.400]  Is there like a race going on?
[24:55.440 --> 24:56.520]  There's a bunch of them down there
[24:57.540 --> 24:58.700]  Is this a track?
[25:01.660 --> 25:02.320]  Look at him
[25:02.320 --> 25:03.440]  Get him
[25:05.200 --> 25:06.480]  Oh my god
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.220]  We're almost there
[25:11.220 --> 25:12.640]  Let's stop dicking around penis
[25:14.720 --> 25:16.000]  Alright, got one
[25:19.860 --> 25:21.400]  Did you say dicking around penis?
[25:22.420 --> 25:22.800]  Yeah
[25:22.800 --> 25:23.620]  Stop it
[25:25.460 --> 25:27.500]  Stop doing it
[25:29.980 --> 25:32.180]  Stop dicking around penis
[25:32.800 --> 25:35.640]  He just gave Nick a new phrase that he's just going to say
[25:37.900 --> 25:39.560]  You dicking my penis?
[25:40.100 --> 25:40.340]  Ok
[25:44.420 --> 25:46.080]  Are we supposed to kill these guys?
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.380]  Extinguishing the fires
[25:48.720 --> 25:50.300]  Put the fires out
[25:50.300 --> 25:51.680]  We need to go to B now
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.080]  B's a burning
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.720]  I'm salvaging the hard drives
[26:00.220 --> 26:01.360]  Still not at B
[26:04.500 --> 26:05.460]  Ok, salvaged
[26:05.460 --> 26:06.400]  On our way to B
[26:07.240 --> 26:08.420]  We're putting it out
[26:08.420 --> 26:09.220]  Let's go Nick
[26:10.180 --> 26:11.400]  To B sharps
[26:12.280 --> 26:12.840]  Great
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.280]  Alright, I'll salvage these
[26:15.280 --> 26:16.320]  Salvaged
[26:16.320 --> 26:18.220]  I'm spraying the enemies with water
[26:18.220 --> 26:19.600]  Sit tight, I'm coming
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.120]  I'm super soaking them
[26:22.580 --> 26:23.980]  Ok, you got it
[26:23.980 --> 26:26.000]  Back in the car
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  Get in
[26:28.400 --> 26:29.360]  Stop moving
[26:33.190 --> 26:34.570]  I'm still soaking them
[26:34.570 --> 26:35.450]  Ok, go
[26:35.450 --> 26:36.410]  Super soaking
[26:39.630 --> 26:41.330]  This is such a mess
[26:42.370 --> 26:43.730]  Yeah, it's kind of crazy
[26:43.730 --> 26:44.970]  Some of these dudes are getting shot
[26:44.970 --> 26:46.110]  And the other ones are just getting spritzed
[26:46.110 --> 26:50.370]  It was the craziest thing
[26:50.370 --> 26:53.230]  This must be the most violent spritz ever
[26:53.930 --> 26:55.490]  It's just headshots and showers
[26:56.410 --> 26:57.830]  It's a spritz
[27:02.830 --> 27:03.270]  Roadblock
[27:03.270 --> 27:04.870]  Can I clean us?
[27:05.170 --> 27:05.890]  Press Y to unblock
[27:06.870 --> 27:07.890]  Roger that
[27:09.590 --> 27:10.230]  Wow
[27:11.850 --> 27:13.710]  Oh my god
[27:15.030 --> 27:17.050]  That guy got flopped like a fish
[27:19.010 --> 27:20.430]  Flopped like a fish
[27:21.870 --> 27:23.510]  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it
[27:23.510 --> 27:24.610]  Fish flop
[27:25.270 --> 27:27.030]  You peening my fish?
[27:29.010 --> 27:29.950]  You dicking my pee
[27:34.710 --> 27:36.250]  I'm hitting them with water
[27:36.250 --> 27:37.290]  I don't know how much it's doing
[27:39.530 --> 27:40.950]  I'm trying to shoot them with gun
[27:40.950 --> 27:44.370]  Somehow you swerving is making this harder
[27:44.370 --> 27:45.570]  Ok, I'll stop swerving
[27:45.570 --> 27:46.790]  Got one
[27:46.790 --> 27:47.390]  One down
[27:47.390 --> 27:50.250]  Nice job
[27:51.090 --> 27:52.030]  Don't worry about it
[27:52.030 --> 27:54.530]  Nice through the uprights
[27:54.530 --> 27:55.270]  It's good
[27:56.850 --> 27:58.110]  Just like the Texas kick
[27:58.110 --> 27:58.610]  We are gone
[28:01.370 --> 28:03.610]  I was so pissed off
[28:05.270 --> 28:10.110]  I didn't realize how small that Arizona quarterback was
[28:11.030 --> 28:12.190]  He was wily
[28:12.190 --> 28:14.090]  That dude is tiny
[28:15.790 --> 28:18.150]  Will Howard for Ohio State is big
[28:18.150 --> 28:19.890]  So my hope is that he's not as nimble
[28:19.890 --> 28:21.950]  And the Longhorns can just tackle it
[28:21.950 --> 28:26.410]  I don't think anyone in this situation in real life would be talking about sport
[28:29.730 --> 28:32.230]  I don't know, didn't you ever see Money Talks?
[28:33.150 --> 28:33.490]  No.
[28:33.770 --> 28:35.630]  Yeah, didn't you ever see Money Talks, Gavin?
[28:35.990 --> 28:36.250]  No.
[28:36.810 --> 28:38.590]  You know Money Talks? Haven't you seen that?
[28:38.750 --> 28:38.990]  No.
[28:39.150 --> 28:43.790]  What do you mean? It's Charlie Sheen and Chris Tucker.
[28:44.410 --> 28:44.970]  Chris Tucker?
[28:46.110 --> 28:46.510]  Yeah!
[28:46.810 --> 28:47.470]  I love Chris Tucker.
[28:47.790 --> 28:49.430]  Wait, there's more? We have to do this again?
[28:49.770 --> 28:50.770]  Yeah. C&D.
[28:50.770 --> 28:51.550]  Oh my god.
[28:52.970 --> 28:53.330]  Anyway...
[28:54.670 --> 28:59.350]  At the end of it, there's two dudes sitting at the top of a stadium with a rocket launcher.
[28:59.510 --> 29:00.950]  They're exchanging a lollipop.
[29:01.990 --> 29:03.670]  And they're talking about sports.
[29:03.990 --> 29:05.630]  As they blow people up on the field.
[29:05.630 --> 29:05.930]  I'm getting this one.
[29:08.070 --> 29:08.270]  Alright.
[29:08.910 --> 29:09.630]  Let's go to A.
[29:11.030 --> 29:12.230]  I mean, let's go to either of them.
[29:12.430 --> 29:12.950]  Put out B!
[29:13.050 --> 29:14.270]  We gotta do either of them.
[29:14.410 --> 29:15.370]  You have to put out B.
[29:15.630 --> 29:16.130]  Was that another one?
[29:17.970 --> 29:18.730]  Okay, now let's go to A.
[29:19.270 --> 29:20.850]  I'm not sure. What was confusing about that?
[29:20.850 --> 29:22.510]  I thought I already put one out over it.
[29:22.610 --> 29:23.510]  You put out one.
[29:23.610 --> 29:24.510]  You put out one of two.
[29:24.610 --> 29:26.570]  Now there's three, so put out three.
[29:26.710 --> 29:27.490]  So, there you go.
[29:27.630 --> 29:28.870]  Got it.
[29:30.930 --> 29:31.730]  On our way, coming up.
[29:32.350 --> 29:32.450]  Okay.
[29:32.990 --> 29:34.290]  Alright, stay there, stay there, stay there.
[29:36.070 --> 29:37.170]  Started moving. That's pretty cool.
[29:38.490 --> 29:39.410]  Way to go, man. Thank you.
[29:39.810 --> 29:39.970]  Who?
[29:40.830 --> 29:41.150]  Uh-huh.
[29:41.550 --> 29:41.830]  You.
[29:42.810 --> 29:43.370]  Yeah, dipshit.
[29:43.370 --> 29:43.830]  What?
[29:46.330 --> 29:46.730]  Oh.
[29:48.890 --> 29:50.370]  Gavin's really dicking my peen.
[29:51.350 --> 29:52.410]  Alright, I mean, let's go.
[29:53.430 --> 29:54.010]  Let's do it.
[29:54.050 --> 29:55.650]  I'm not in the fucking thing!
[29:55.690 --> 29:57.310]  Where were you? Where were you at?
[29:58.490 --> 29:59.570]  Why were you out?
[29:59.970 --> 30:00.490]  That's wild.
[30:00.510 --> 30:01.690]  Because I ran up to A.
[30:02.210 --> 30:02.970]  Or B, or whatever.
[30:03.290 --> 30:03.750]  You were doing A?
[30:04.950 --> 30:08.150]  Just to be clear, I salvaged all three of those guys.
[30:08.270 --> 30:10.050]  No, I salvaged the second one. What are you talking about?
[30:11.410 --> 30:12.310]  Get in the footage!
[30:12.310 --> 30:14.270]  Do you think he did one, but you didn't?
[30:14.490 --> 30:14.610]  He didn't.
[30:14.770 --> 30:15.710]  I did one.
[30:15.930 --> 30:16.730]  He didn't.
[30:16.730 --> 30:17.410]  I did.
[30:17.570 --> 30:20.310]  And I'll press right on the D-pad to salvage.
[30:20.530 --> 30:21.330]  And Nick did that.
[30:21.450 --> 30:21.890]  I love that.
[30:21.890 --> 30:24.330]  50% eat sounds like 100% disagree.
[30:25.030 --> 30:26.150]  And 50% disagree.
[30:27.810 --> 30:29.790]  Yeah, 50% right, 50% wrong.
[30:29.950 --> 30:30.710]  And I'm right.
[30:31.430 --> 30:32.170]  Like a fox.
[30:33.690 --> 30:36.350]  Just trying to imagine this written out as an equation.
[30:37.390 --> 30:41.890]  50% eat, 50% wrong, and 100% wrong, and 50% right.
[30:41.890 --> 30:43.750]  50% disagree, that's a 50% agree, right?
[30:44.370 --> 30:45.270]  There it is.
[30:47.790 --> 30:48.670]  No, yeah.
[30:51.950 --> 30:54.370]  I'm just gonna walk away, Regis. I'm just gonna take the money.
[30:54.750 --> 30:55.950]  I need to open my window.
[30:57.930 --> 31:01.370]  The most Nick thing. Disagreeing, agreeing, disagreeing.
[31:01.610 --> 31:02.330]  What do you mean?
[31:03.170 --> 31:03.590]  No.
[31:04.250 --> 31:04.750]  Well, maybe.
[31:05.750 --> 31:06.930]  There you have it.
[31:08.070 --> 31:09.710]  Is this what it's like to talk to me?
[31:10.330 --> 31:10.630]  Yes.
[31:12.190 --> 31:15.430]  Lately, you've been catching yourself, stopping yourself, and going, what?
[31:16.570 --> 31:16.930]  Yeah.
[31:18.490 --> 31:18.930]  Yeah.
[31:19.670 --> 31:21.350]  I'm getting dumber by the day.
[31:22.990 --> 31:24.630]  I think it's just the cat breath.
[31:27.870 --> 31:29.230]  Andrew's straight in there with the bullet.
[31:30.930 --> 31:32.930]  You guys have been spending too much time together, baby.
[31:33.430 --> 31:37.350]  Maybe, maybe. Maybe Andrew should spend another weekend, you know, buying another bunker.
[31:40.050 --> 31:42.390]  This bunker ain't big enough for the both of us.
[31:43.010 --> 31:43.490]  Priorities.
[31:43.690 --> 31:47.890]  I think my big thing recently is that, Andrew, you have no respect for time.
[31:48.210 --> 31:49.690]  Your own! Your own!
[31:51.610 --> 31:53.390]  Insane. That's an insane take.
[31:53.970 --> 31:54.850]  It's true, though.
[31:54.990 --> 31:58.190]  I spent my whole weekend to make you spend less time.
[31:58.290 --> 32:01.330]  That doesn't, that's exactly right. You don't respect your time.
[32:01.550 --> 32:07.330]  Do you think, do you think you mean, like, he didn't say disrespectful of our time only.
[32:07.330 --> 32:08.770]  Like, you understand that.
[32:08.990 --> 32:11.090]  I assume he would only care about his time.
[32:11.370 --> 32:13.930]  No! No! He cares about all of our time!
[32:14.530 --> 32:15.430]  I had fun.
[32:16.610 --> 32:20.670]  Okay, well, you don't waste your time if you're having fun. I've always said that.
[32:25.140 --> 32:26.960]  I need a vacation. I need to take a break.
[32:27.560 --> 32:29.320]  From what? The game?
[32:29.540 --> 32:30.120]  All of this.
[32:30.220 --> 32:31.220]  You're out next week, right?
[32:31.680 --> 32:31.900]  Yeah.
[32:32.400 --> 32:33.260]  There you go.
[32:33.420 --> 32:35.780]  Yeah, I'm counting the days.
[32:36.200 --> 32:38.220]  What series should we do while those guys are gone?
[32:39.280 --> 32:41.840]  I mean, they're real.
[32:42.000 --> 32:42.140]  Okay.
[32:43.700 --> 32:44.700]  Who's that? Who's that?
[32:45.000 --> 32:45.740]  Geoff and Eric.
[32:47.000 --> 32:48.580]  It's behind you. Gavin, it's behind you.
[32:48.840 --> 32:49.060]  Gavin.
[32:49.220 --> 32:49.440]  What?
[32:49.660 --> 32:50.580]  Gavin, it's behind you.
[32:50.820 --> 32:52.020]  Gavin, it's behind you.
[32:52.220 --> 32:54.320]  I know there's one behind me. I'm putting one out, you fool.
[32:55.640 --> 32:56.620]  You just put out C.
[32:56.720 --> 32:57.500]  There's four of them.
[33:01.360 --> 33:02.160]  Okay, now...
[33:02.160 --> 33:02.380]  Fuck!
[33:03.100 --> 33:03.320]  B.
[33:03.440 --> 33:04.280]  Ah, fuck!
[33:04.580 --> 33:06.360]  Why did everyone suddenly die?
[33:07.580 --> 33:08.760]  And now, A.
[33:08.760 --> 33:09.360]  Because...
[33:10.240 --> 33:11.120]  I don't know why.
[33:13.900 --> 33:16.820]  It's Geoff and Eric, I believe. So it's the three of us. What do we do?
[33:17.120 --> 33:17.320]  So...
[33:17.320 --> 33:18.420]  What are we doing?
[33:19.080 --> 33:20.760]  So we need to...
[33:21.840 --> 33:23.240]  How are we going to do this?
[33:24.440 --> 33:24.980]  Put out fire.
[33:25.200 --> 33:25.740]  Putting out fire.
[33:25.860 --> 33:27.520]  Shut the fuck up.
[33:27.920 --> 33:29.260]  So in the middle...
[33:29.260 --> 33:32.760]  Because we're getting out in the middle of a firefight to...
[33:33.740 --> 33:34.380]  Put out the fire.
[33:37.460 --> 33:37.860]  How...
[33:37.860 --> 33:39.640]  Maybe we can get out, like, outside?
[33:39.800 --> 33:42.360]  Yeah, I think that's what we have to do.
[33:42.480 --> 33:43.680]  I think we have to...
[33:44.800 --> 33:46.160]  I think we have to jump...
[33:46.160 --> 33:53.720]  Like, we have to bail before they get in there, so that way we can, like, flank and figure out what to go after.
[33:57.540 --> 34:00.140]  Wait, did I forget to stop my audio?
[34:03.120 --> 34:04.380]  Do you not have audio for this?
[34:04.960 --> 34:08.440]  No, I do, but it says an hour and forty-seven. I think I just didn't close the file after.
[34:09.040 --> 34:10.240]  So you didn't drop down?
[34:10.640 --> 34:11.420]  I didn't drop down.
[34:13.600 --> 34:15.760]  You're the one that asked for it!
[34:16.140 --> 34:17.600]  Andrew, I think you're in the driver's seat.
[34:17.760 --> 34:18.200]  Yeah, he is.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.480]  Another great thing that could only happen in a video game.
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.140]  Who's driving?
[34:27.820 --> 34:29.400]  Who's driving? I don't know, man.
[34:30.100 --> 34:31.280]  I couldn't tell who got in first.
[34:31.280 --> 34:34.520]  So you want me to stop before we go in, so you guys can get out?
[34:34.660 --> 34:36.140]  Uh, I guess so.
[34:37.200 --> 34:45.620]  It's hard, because if we get out in the middle of where all that stuff is, it's just right in the middle of, like, a really heavy firefight.
[34:45.840 --> 34:47.920]  And I just... we're just not gonna be...
[34:49.300 --> 34:50.420]  We're just not gonna be strong.
[34:50.780 --> 34:51.880]  Nice spin out!
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.800]  But I wonder if it's a thing where if we all stay in the car...
[35:03.140 --> 35:09.460]  And you put them all out, and then we get out of the car and take them one by one, I wonder if that's faster.
[35:09.620 --> 35:10.440]  That's not a bad idea.
[35:10.620 --> 35:13.520]  Yeah, maybe, because the time is only for the flames, not for the game.
[35:14.220 --> 35:14.700]  Yeah. Yeah.
[35:16.600 --> 35:20.420]  So, okay, so let's do that. Let's just stay in the car, so you don't have to... you don't have to stop early.
[35:20.500 --> 35:24.200]  We'll just stay in the car and try to pick guys off as we... that was cool.
[35:25.140 --> 35:28.320]  You know what they should put in GTA 6? A plane that can drop water.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.520]  Water plane.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.320]  Like a firefighting plane.
[35:35.220 --> 35:40.160]  Yeah, but then that means I'm gonna have to do GTA 6 missions in the firefighting plane, and I don't want to do that.
[35:40.540 --> 35:40.900]  Why not?
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.980]  Because it's... because I have... because I'm gonna have to do it.
[35:44.500 --> 35:46.960]  Yeah, that sounds great. You line with the water, you pick up water.
[35:46.960 --> 35:49.620]  Online, it sounds awesome. In the game, it's... I don't... I'm not gonna love it.
[35:51.220 --> 35:53.440]  Alright, park in between these, and I'll get D and you get C.
[35:53.720 --> 35:57.020]  No, no, we just have to start... there you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see what you're saying.
[35:57.460 --> 35:57.860]  What?
[35:58.800 --> 35:59.680]  Nothing. I see what you're saying. You're good.
[36:00.160 --> 36:00.380]  Okay.
[36:08.650 --> 36:10.650]  Yeah, I think this is the way to do it.
[36:18.910 --> 36:19.450]  Uh-oh.
[36:19.610 --> 36:20.130]  One more.
[36:21.610 --> 36:22.010]  Shit.
[36:22.490 --> 36:24.250]  Oh, I'm getting eviscerated.
[36:24.450 --> 36:24.890]  Are you?
[36:25.310 --> 36:25.810]  Oh, yeah.
[36:26.610 --> 36:27.050]  I'm dead.
[36:27.570 --> 36:31.790]  No way! Really? I didn't know you could get... I wasn't like getting shot there at all.
[36:32.410 --> 36:33.710]  I was getting lit.
[36:36.210 --> 36:39.310]  Maybe have your sub-menu open so you can eat snacks or put on armor.
[36:39.530 --> 36:43.790]  I had it open and closed it to keep firing, then I started to reopen it and died.
[36:45.170 --> 36:46.490]  But I'll... yeah, I'll just keep it open.
[36:47.810 --> 36:49.110]  Before... are you unarmed, Nick?
[36:51.450 --> 36:52.690]  Yeah, looks like it.
[36:52.810 --> 36:53.770]  Hit left on the D-pad.
[36:54.790 --> 36:58.190]  Oh my god, he's doing it! You can't grab... you have snowballs!
[36:58.950 --> 36:59.310]  Wow!
[36:59.830 --> 36:59.970]  Wow!
[37:01.830 --> 37:03.050]  Ah, I got snowed!
[37:03.050 --> 37:03.570]  Ah!
[37:06.850 --> 37:07.530]  That's crazy!
[37:07.810 --> 37:09.090]  It's beginning to look a lot like...
[37:11.970 --> 37:14.010]  And this would come out for so long.
[37:16.210 --> 37:18.270]  Well, maybe there'll be snow again when this comes out.
[37:19.190 --> 37:19.810]  That'd be cool.
[37:21.210 --> 37:21.750]  Would it?
[37:22.210 --> 37:22.610]  Yeah!
[37:23.350 --> 37:24.670]  For this to come out a year later.
[37:25.270 --> 37:25.350]  I like snow!
[37:27.170 --> 37:30.410]  Andrew's not considering when it would come out, he's just considering, I like snow.
[37:30.490 --> 37:32.010]  Yeah, I just... I'm excited about the snow.
[37:33.050 --> 37:34.330]  Do you like snow in real life?
[37:34.670 --> 37:36.070]  Yeah, I love snow in real life.
[37:36.190 --> 37:36.950]  Dude, snow rules.
[37:38.790 --> 37:41.050]  If I could live somewhere where it snowed every day, I would.
[37:43.110 --> 37:44.370]  I think snow...
[37:44.370 --> 37:45.210]  I think Nebraska persecuted snow.
[37:45.210 --> 37:46.110]  Yeah, but that's just the other side.
[37:46.110 --> 37:46.250]  Snow is fun.
[37:46.390 --> 37:48.570]  That's true, I guess it doesn't snow all the time.
[37:49.030 --> 37:52.810]  Snow is fun the day it settles, and the rest of the time it's utter bullshit.
[37:53.130 --> 37:55.450]  I think it's great, I just like the look at it.
[37:55.910 --> 38:01.830]  I like when it's snowing, I like when it's snowing. I don't like the aftermath of snow.
[38:03.050 --> 38:03.890]  That is very fair.
[38:04.170 --> 38:05.710]  I don't like the slush afterwards.
[38:05.810 --> 38:10.490]  Yeah, the brown slush, and it's still cold, and it's not fun, and it's... gross.
[38:11.890 --> 38:12.290]  It sucks.
[38:12.290 --> 38:13.990]  And then your feet are all wet.
[38:14.470 --> 38:14.750]  Yeah.
[38:15.030 --> 38:15.430]  Yeah.
[38:16.070 --> 38:17.050]  You know what, I hate snow.
[38:22.910 --> 38:25.730]  I have some bad news for you, Nick, it's in your pockets.
[38:27.510 --> 38:28.870]  You just pick up a bunch.
[38:32.170 --> 38:33.070]  Yeah, snow.
[38:34.850 --> 38:36.370]  That's the white powder in my pocket.
[38:40.170 --> 38:40.590]  Cool.
[38:43.650 --> 38:47.210]  Alright, we gotta be getting close.
[38:47.730 --> 38:49.010]  Why are they trying to burn hard drives?
[38:49.670 --> 38:51.230]  I don't know, why are they doing it publicly?
[38:54.110 --> 38:55.750]  Take it in a warehouse.
[38:57.710 --> 38:58.550]  Very weird.
[39:00.090 --> 39:00.510]  Okay.
[39:00.510 --> 39:01.150]  Okay, here we go.
[39:01.210 --> 39:05.170]  Wouldn't you just like, I don't know, format it?
[39:06.890 --> 39:08.690]  Nah, destroy them.
[39:10.550 --> 39:11.310]  In a van?
[39:14.270 --> 39:15.490]  Yeah, probably not in a van.
[39:18.170 --> 39:19.270]  Someone fell out.
[39:20.770 --> 39:21.590]  We're good, we're good.
[39:28.800 --> 39:31.360]  Why did you... you went against your own plan?
[39:31.680 --> 39:31.880]  Yeah.
[39:33.120 --> 39:33.640]  Are you a fool?
[39:33.960 --> 39:34.260]  Yeah.
[39:35.720 --> 39:36.620]  Why you do?
[39:39.540 --> 39:40.820]  Alright, should we get out and stop Bip?
[39:41.540 --> 39:42.080]  Yeah, let's Bip.
[39:42.920 --> 39:43.260]  Ow.
[39:47.340 --> 39:48.160]  Help him, Bip.
[39:51.620 --> 39:52.700]  Welcome to Bip City.
[39:53.180 --> 39:53.760]  Oh, shit!
[39:54.260 --> 39:54.840]  Okay, I'm alright.
[40:03.510 --> 40:04.230]  Are we Bipping?
[40:07.250 --> 40:08.290]  Okay, I got two of them.
[40:08.870 --> 40:10.690]  I got one, and now...
[40:10.690 --> 40:11.610]  Are there people on the roof?
[40:12.030 --> 40:12.330]  Yeah.
[40:13.730 --> 40:15.910]  Let's get back to the armored car, Gavin.
[40:16.070 --> 40:16.330]  Ready up.
[40:17.030 --> 40:18.310]  Go, go, go, go.
[40:19.650 --> 40:20.190]  Uh-oh.
[40:23.030 --> 40:24.110]  There's one more?
[40:24.270 --> 40:24.790]  Jesus Christ.
[40:25.690 --> 40:27.050]  We got six and a half minutes.
[40:29.930 --> 40:32.110]  Is this how many hard drives are getting rid of at RT?
[40:36.630 --> 40:37.550]  Oh, my God.
[40:38.030 --> 40:38.670]  Oh, God.
[40:38.890 --> 40:41.050]  I don't have a shot on him.
[40:41.670 --> 40:41.950]  He's too high.
[40:41.950 --> 40:43.210]  I can't shoot.
[40:46.880 --> 40:48.120]  I can try and wash him.
[40:51.340 --> 40:53.500]  Luckily, he doesn't realize he has rockets, I guess.
[40:56.300 --> 40:56.620]  Oh.
[40:56.880 --> 40:57.240]  Oh!
[40:57.680 --> 40:58.440]  Fuck off.
[41:07.400 --> 41:08.060]  Uh-oh.
[41:08.780 --> 41:10.020]  I hope the train doesn't come.
[41:10.100 --> 41:10.560]  Uh-oh.
[41:10.580 --> 41:11.520]  Oh, we're really stuck.
[41:12.260 --> 41:12.560]  Uh-oh.
[41:12.980 --> 41:13.820]  Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[41:13.840 --> 41:14.220]  Come on, now.
[41:17.980 --> 41:18.420]  Wow!
[41:19.200 --> 41:19.840]  Nice job.
[41:20.680 --> 41:22.220]  We're a bit holey on the top.
[41:22.820 --> 41:25.280]  You'd think the chopper would have come in and taken advantage of that.
[41:25.480 --> 41:25.600]  Yeah.
[41:25.940 --> 41:26.520]  You would think.
[41:28.420 --> 41:29.660]  I guess he hasn't gone to flight school.
[41:30.540 --> 41:31.000]  Not yet.
[41:31.020 --> 41:31.980]  Oh, my God, he almost hit a bridge.
[41:32.760 --> 41:33.080]  Oh!
[41:33.980 --> 41:34.920]  Wow, good shot, though.
[41:35.140 --> 41:35.980]  Holy shit.
[41:36.280 --> 41:36.560]  That's a lot.
[41:37.100 --> 41:38.360]  I think he did hit the bridge a little bit.
[41:38.360 --> 41:39.120]  Oh, my God.
[41:40.860 --> 41:41.180]  ABCDE.
[41:43.660 --> 41:43.980]  Absoda.
[41:47.160 --> 41:48.660]  Holy God, they're everywhere.
[41:48.840 --> 41:49.720]  Yeah, this is crazy.
[41:51.420 --> 41:53.620]  All right, I'm going to go ahead and say, don't get out.
[41:53.960 --> 41:54.800]  No, I'm not.
[41:56.360 --> 41:57.360]  I'm thinking you're on to something.
[42:00.360 --> 42:01.880]  These dudes can take a lot of bullets.
[42:05.780 --> 42:06.140]  Good.
[42:07.140 --> 42:07.840]  There's one more.
[42:08.020 --> 42:08.500]  We can make up mine over there.
[42:08.700 --> 42:09.300]  Yep, yep, yep.
[42:16.390 --> 42:17.110]  Moving around.
[42:21.870 --> 42:23.570]  Oh, let's watch these fools into the water.
[42:23.570 --> 42:27.770]  All right, I'm getting out.
[42:29.030 --> 42:30.010]  That guy went quiet.
[42:30.370 --> 42:30.530]  Cool.
[42:30.850 --> 42:32.050]  He's shooting into the door.
[42:33.670 --> 42:34.770]  Get washed, son.
[42:36.650 --> 42:37.410]  All right, he's dead.
[42:37.550 --> 42:37.710]  Supporting.
[42:39.530 --> 42:40.050]  He's dead.
[42:40.410 --> 42:40.630]  Ah!
[42:40.910 --> 42:41.690]  Oh, shit, what happened?
[42:41.890 --> 42:42.210]  Oh!
[42:42.830 --> 42:43.750]  Yeah, there's a...
[42:43.750 --> 42:44.450]  All right, I got one.
[42:44.590 --> 42:45.050]  ...army of them.
[42:45.630 --> 42:46.250]  Let's move back.
[42:46.630 --> 42:46.850]  Ah!
[42:47.210 --> 42:47.990]  Andrew, bring your car.
[42:49.890 --> 42:53.550]  I was washing them, and then suddenly I was in the driver's seat, and I started driving towards the water.
[42:58.780 --> 42:59.520]  Eric, look out!
[43:00.700 --> 43:01.500]  Shoot him.
[43:02.820 --> 43:03.220]  Yeah.
[43:07.570 --> 43:08.150]  Oh, money.
[43:08.290 --> 43:09.430]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[43:10.990 --> 43:11.710]  Jesus Christ.
[43:11.710 --> 43:13.150]  He ran super in front of me there.
[43:16.290 --> 43:16.890]  One more?
[43:17.490 --> 43:18.010]  Two more.
[43:18.090 --> 43:18.330]  Two more.
[43:19.950 --> 43:20.350]  Grabbing.
[43:21.230 --> 43:21.930]  I'll cover you.
[43:22.070 --> 43:22.550]  Thank you.
[43:23.910 --> 43:24.570]  Oh, they're just...
[43:24.570 --> 43:25.330]  Yeah, they're just spawning.
[43:25.490 --> 43:25.670]  You got it?
[43:26.530 --> 43:26.930]  Bullshit.
[43:27.090 --> 43:27.990]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[43:27.990 --> 43:31.290]  All right, bring the car over.
[43:31.510 --> 43:32.130]  Coming over.
[43:39.960 --> 43:40.840]  And then...
[43:40.840 --> 43:41.460]  Let's get out of here.
[43:45.170 --> 43:45.590]  Ow!
[43:46.110 --> 43:46.690]  We all in?
[43:47.170 --> 43:47.490]  Yeah.
[43:47.830 --> 43:48.130]  Let's go.
[43:49.850 --> 43:50.450]  Cool, good work.
[43:50.530 --> 43:51.010]  That was a good one.
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.140]  It's insane that this is a setup.
[44:02.260 --> 44:02.700]  Yeah.
[44:03.120 --> 44:04.240]  Yeah, that's kind of nuts.
[44:08.940 --> 44:10.240]  I should have taken that jump.
[44:10.400 --> 44:10.900]  Damn it.
[44:18.790 --> 44:19.230]  Rabbit.
[44:20.810 --> 44:22.230]  Hey, what are you doing up there?
[44:22.430 --> 44:24.570]  I found another Ukrainian rabbit on TikTok.
[44:25.230 --> 44:25.950]  Is his name Gavin?
[44:26.270 --> 44:28.830]  No, it's nicer than the Gavin rabbit.
[44:29.650 --> 44:31.210]  Why are they Ukrainian?
[44:32.210 --> 44:33.130]  I don't know.
[44:33.210 --> 44:36.190]  I don't know why I found two Ukrainian jackrabbits.
[44:36.350 --> 44:36.590]  Oh!
[44:37.150 --> 44:38.270]  Oh, that guy had a bad morning.
[44:39.030 --> 44:40.750]  Well, he died before he hit the ground.
[44:44.050 --> 44:45.330]  May not have been that bad.
[44:52.860 --> 44:55.360]  They won't be able to see where they're going now.
[44:56.800 --> 44:57.400]  I got air.
[44:58.040 --> 44:58.560]  Turn!
[44:58.740 --> 44:59.220]  Missed the turn.
[44:59.580 --> 44:59.780]  Tango!
[45:04.450 --> 45:06.530]  Health inspector, you got a dirty truck.
[45:07.030 --> 45:08.030]  Dirty truck!
[45:08.390 --> 45:10.090]  Get those holes taken out.
[45:10.090 --> 45:11.140]  Your truck's got wrecked.
[45:12.450 --> 45:13.410]  Yeah, baby!
[45:17.110 --> 45:17.690]  Whoa!
[45:18.010 --> 45:19.390]  Whoa, that was weird.
[45:19.870 --> 45:20.510]  That was weird.
[45:21.210 --> 45:22.290]  What was weird about it?
[45:22.810 --> 45:25.410]  It kind of stuck and then froze and then flew.
[45:26.690 --> 45:27.970]  Stuck and froze and flew.
[45:31.150 --> 45:32.290]  What if we failed?
[45:34.050 --> 45:34.850]  Oh, no.
[45:35.710 --> 45:36.290]  Okay.
[45:36.690 --> 45:37.170]  Okay.
[45:37.170 --> 45:37.350]  Yay!
[45:39.090 --> 45:42.170]  Luckily, this game is more forgiving on the flipping of the vehicles than Ford.
[45:43.950 --> 45:44.790]  Where are you going?
[45:45.150 --> 45:46.890]  You gonna bother to make that turn or what?
[45:47.130 --> 45:47.550]  Big time.
[45:48.210 --> 45:49.490]  Wait, you're driving, Gavin?
[45:49.630 --> 45:49.790]  Yeah.
[45:50.050 --> 45:50.790]  You couldn't tell?
[45:52.390 --> 45:52.830]  No.
[45:54.390 --> 45:55.630]  It's all pretty obvious.
[45:56.310 --> 46:01.170]  That was almost a major disaster for all seriously intelligent life on this planet, my friends.
[46:01.730 --> 46:02.630]  Well, over...
[46:11.360 --> 46:12.320]  Money everywhere.
[46:12.700 --> 46:12.760]  Yeah!
[46:18.090 --> 46:19.450]  Bronze to platinum.
[46:20.370 --> 46:20.970]  Damn straight.
[46:27.760 --> 46:29.440]  Hey, Gavin, can you call me in a helicopter?
[46:30.340 --> 46:30.580]  Yeah.
[46:34.140 --> 46:36.040]  Associate vehicles, buzzard.
[46:37.740 --> 46:38.520]  Thank you.
[46:40.160 --> 46:41.080]  Fly through the windmills.
[46:42.340 --> 46:43.080]  Where are they?
[46:44.880 --> 46:46.040]  They gotta be on the way, right?
[46:46.280 --> 46:46.840]  Yeah, they're on the way.
[46:48.000 --> 46:48.620]  Yeah, straight ahead.
[46:49.480 --> 46:50.020]  Where are they?
[46:50.100 --> 46:50.900]  They're over here, right?
[46:51.020 --> 46:51.160]  Yep.
[46:51.360 --> 46:51.500]  Yeah.
[46:51.940 --> 46:52.460]  To the right?
[46:52.700 --> 46:53.720]  Those are...
[46:53.720 --> 46:54.540]  They're right over there.
[46:54.540 --> 46:54.700]  Where are you?
[47:08.300 --> 47:08.860]  Wow.
[47:10.080 --> 47:11.160]  Dude, you're cooking.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.080]  Well, wowzer.
[47:20.440 --> 47:21.840]  Well, we're over here now.
[47:24.540 --> 47:25.480]  Oh, look at this.
[47:26.940 --> 47:29.780]  They know exactly who it needs to be.
[47:30.620 --> 47:32.960]  Are we gonna be waterproof or are we gonna be impermeable?
[47:32.960 --> 47:33.940]  We naturally figured it out.
[47:35.040 --> 47:37.400]  I think I'm gonna be waterproof and you can be impermeable.
[47:37.520 --> 47:38.120]  How about that?
[47:38.220 --> 47:38.680]  That looks good.
[47:38.920 --> 47:39.380]  Makes sense.
[47:39.500 --> 47:39.980]  I like it.
[47:44.600 --> 47:45.780]  We got our little hoods up.
[47:48.020 --> 47:48.920]  Oh, we're hood down.
[47:50.760 --> 47:51.280]  Team hood.
[47:53.500 --> 47:53.860]  What?
[47:55.240 --> 47:56.000]  I think so.
[47:57.060 --> 47:58.120]  History will be on our side.
[47:58.380 --> 47:59.780]  We're like cut versus uncut kind of thing, you know?
[48:00.360 --> 48:01.060]  We're the downers.
[48:03.860 --> 48:05.060]  All right, where to boys?
[48:05.520 --> 48:06.280]  Whoa, cool cars.
[48:07.380 --> 48:08.200]  Do we each get one?
[48:08.520 --> 48:09.000]  Hell yeah.
[48:10.140 --> 48:11.080]  I'll take the one in the front.
[48:11.620 --> 48:12.460]  Okay, I got the one in the second.
[48:16.300 --> 48:18.100]  Oh man, this one's a decoy.
[48:23.880 --> 48:25.840]  Oh, this is the car from the Spice Up.
[48:27.280 --> 48:27.920]  Lights to spray.
[48:30.600 --> 48:31.360]  The Strombo?
[48:31.460 --> 48:31.760]  What's this?
[48:33.100 --> 48:34.100]  Yeah, the Strombo.
[48:36.360 --> 48:37.740]  We play a lot of Indiana Jones.
[48:37.920 --> 48:38.880]  She keeps calling him that.
[48:39.100 --> 48:42.220]  It's just...
[48:51.590 --> 48:55.350]  Man, you undercut me like crazy.
[48:55.410 --> 48:55.830]  That was awesome.
[48:56.030 --> 48:56.710]  Nicky, you need to be careful.
[48:57.390 --> 48:57.750]  Oh, yeah.
[49:00.830 --> 49:01.950]  Watch yourself, hood team.
[49:06.550 --> 49:07.390]  Oh, shit.
[49:08.710 --> 49:09.150]  Whoopsie.
[49:13.470 --> 49:14.510]  We have missiles?
[49:19.620 --> 49:20.620]  Oh, we do have missiles.
[49:21.780 --> 49:23.640]  Oh, Andrew, you just hit a guy really hard.
[49:30.860 --> 49:31.800]  Oh my god.
[49:32.080 --> 49:32.800]  Let's take it out.
[49:32.880 --> 49:33.360]  Oh, shit!
[49:33.940 --> 49:35.180]  You saved that guy, Andrew.
[49:39.150 --> 49:40.010]  How's my goal?
[49:42.370 --> 49:44.070]  Have you seen what a weirdo...
[49:44.070 --> 49:44.370]  Oh no.
[49:44.430 --> 49:44.650]  Oh no.
[49:45.270 --> 49:47.610]  What's his name looks like in that Flight Risk movie?
[49:48.030 --> 49:48.950]  Dude, Mark Wahlberg?
[49:49.310 --> 49:49.650]  Yeah.
[49:49.850 --> 49:50.390]  Hell yeah.
[49:52.190 --> 49:53.610]  Mark Wahlberg's bald.
[49:54.150 --> 49:54.530]  But like not...
[49:54.530 --> 49:58.490]  Mark Wahlberg's himself until he's revealed to be the bad guy and then he's a bald...
[49:58.670 --> 50:02.550]  It's not like I shaved my head like Agent 47 or whatever.
[50:02.770 --> 50:05.550]  It's like male pattern baldness bald.
[50:05.810 --> 50:07.130]  And it's Mark Wahlberg.
[50:07.150 --> 50:07.450]  It's horseshoe bald.
[50:07.590 --> 50:08.650]  It's so weird.
[50:09.170 --> 50:10.270]  It's so weird.
[50:11.530 --> 50:11.970]  Hmm.
[50:13.470 --> 50:15.090]  Just like what a strange choice.
[50:15.470 --> 50:15.850]  Yeah.
[50:18.750 --> 50:23.010]  Especially since he seemed to have been himself before that.
[50:23.090 --> 50:23.730]  Yeah, no kidding.
[50:24.090 --> 50:26.330]  It's just Mark Wahlberg playing Mark Wahlberg and then it was like,
[50:26.390 --> 50:28.590]  Deceit, this is not Mark Wahlberg.
[50:28.850 --> 50:30.230]  This is Mark Wahlberg with no hair.
[50:30.710 --> 50:31.350]  Is this a new movie?
[50:31.930 --> 50:33.170]  Yeah, it's called Flight Risk.
[50:33.330 --> 50:37.270]  It's him, Topher Grace, and then what's her name, Michelle...
[50:38.410 --> 50:40.050]  Oh, I can never remember.
[50:40.050 --> 50:42.710]  I like Toph.
[50:43.090 --> 50:44.210]  Yeah, he's in it.
[50:44.550 --> 50:46.270]  There's only like three people in the movie.
[50:48.030 --> 50:49.050]  Andrew, you parked.
[50:51.310 --> 50:51.830]  Oh.
[50:52.290 --> 50:52.430]  What?
[50:53.170 --> 50:53.890]  Getting a drink.
[50:55.410 --> 50:57.090]  That didn't happen in the Spy Love Me.
[50:57.410 --> 50:57.870]  Getting a drink.
[51:01.370 --> 51:02.650]  Nick's just firing, dude.
[51:04.930 --> 51:06.670]  Somebody hasn't seen the deleted scenes.
[51:08.090 --> 51:09.610]  Roger Moore kept asking for it.
[51:15.040 --> 51:16.760]  This car handles so well.
[51:28.580 --> 51:30.260]  We're going to have to do this mission again.
[51:32.960 --> 51:34.200]  These cars are pretty resilient.
[51:35.360 --> 51:36.920]  Not like that piece of shit truck.
[51:46.850 --> 51:47.230]  Whoops.
[51:51.730 --> 51:52.950]  Can we damage each other?
[51:53.090 --> 51:53.790]  I don't think so.
[51:54.450 --> 51:54.610]  Oh.
[51:58.210 --> 51:59.130]  Alright, here we go.
[52:01.330 --> 52:03.410]  Oh, are we doing this shit? Here we go.
[52:08.200 --> 52:08.700]  Get him.
[52:09.640 --> 52:10.020]  Okay.
[52:12.320 --> 52:12.720]  How can we...
[52:12.720 --> 52:13.980]  There you go, nice.
[52:16.780 --> 52:17.540]  Oh, nice.
[52:17.840 --> 52:19.140]  Oh, it's hell on earth for those guys.
[52:19.220 --> 52:21.320]  Oh my god, the wheels are shaking.
[52:21.320 --> 52:23.980]  Oh, his bike is...
[52:23.980 --> 52:26.160]  Oh god, damn.
[52:26.840 --> 52:27.400]  Gavin!
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.820]  I got the helicopter in the back.
[52:33.280 --> 52:37.840]  Oh my god.
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.840]  How do we get the helicopter?
[52:41.160 --> 52:41.780]  Get close.
[52:45.980 --> 52:46.860]  Gavin's got it.
[52:47.100 --> 52:47.380]  Get it.
[52:47.380 --> 52:48.040]  Oh shit.
[52:48.200 --> 52:48.620]  Get it.
[52:48.760 --> 52:51.280]  Dude, I have awesome shots in the back.
[52:51.280 --> 52:51.760]  Nice.
[52:52.200 --> 52:52.720]  Ouch.
[52:52.720 --> 52:53.960]  I gotcha.
[52:57.820 --> 52:59.320]  Alright, let's do it.
[53:01.140 --> 53:03.080]  And that's how you de-convoy.
[53:06.040 --> 53:09.540]  We lost that big ol' convoy truckin' through the snow.
[53:09.840 --> 53:10.380]  Oh my god.
[53:18.220 --> 53:19.340]  Oh shit.
[53:25.720 --> 53:27.000]  I'm gonna slow you down.
[53:27.120 --> 53:28.160]  I slowed myself down.
[53:28.260 --> 53:29.380]  Oh wow.
[53:32.500 --> 53:36.980]  Oh, I hope you're enjoying your lodge stay, because your truck just got blown up.
[53:38.040 --> 53:43.260]  Alright, almost there.
[53:47.540 --> 53:49.380]  Who went too far past?
[53:50.120 --> 53:50.620]  Past?
[53:52.760 --> 53:53.880]  Oh, they're different locations.
[53:54.080 --> 53:55.200]  What's submersible mode?
[53:56.320 --> 53:57.260]  Do I hit, like, right bumper?
[53:58.440 --> 53:59.240]  I should tell you.
[53:59.280 --> 53:59.560]  Oh, there we go.
[54:01.780 --> 54:03.120]  Cool, I got out of the car.
[54:03.980 --> 54:04.320]  Great.
[54:06.980 --> 54:07.660]  Oh shit.
[54:07.760 --> 54:09.260]  I got out of the car.
[54:10.980 --> 54:11.700]  In the water?
[54:11.700 --> 54:12.060]  You did?
[54:12.220 --> 54:12.440]  Yes.
[54:12.640 --> 54:13.520]  How are you gonna get back in?
[54:13.580 --> 54:14.680]  Dunno, I'm swimming towards it.
[54:15.100 --> 54:15.740]  Did we? Uh oh.
[54:17.840 --> 54:20.320]  I hit right on the D-pad and...
[54:21.920 --> 54:22.500]  There we go.
[54:22.560 --> 54:23.720]  Okay, I'm back in it.
[54:26.020 --> 54:27.240]  They're taking these sea mines!
[54:27.460 --> 54:28.600]  I can't believe you could get in it underwater.
[54:29.620 --> 54:32.300]  Seems kind of, uh, pointless, doesn't it?
[54:32.600 --> 54:34.060]  There we go. Jesus Christ.
[54:34.320 --> 54:36.360]  It would not switch to submersible mode.
[54:37.500 --> 54:40.420]  I was just sitting in the car and it was like,
[54:42.340 --> 54:42.820]  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[54:50.440 --> 54:53.420]  Oh, I see.
[54:53.520 --> 54:54.780]  How do I fire torpedoes?
[54:54.880 --> 54:55.020]  Eh.
[54:55.320 --> 54:56.280]  What the fuck?
[54:56.860 --> 54:57.620]  Why would it switch?
[54:57.620 --> 55:02.980]  Left bumper and right bumper control some steering in the water.
[55:03.640 --> 55:04.320]  Oh, is it up and down?
[55:07.280 --> 55:08.260]  Oh, it's the turn.
[55:08.720 --> 55:09.720]  Yeah, it's like the rudder.
[55:13.900 --> 55:15.580]  Awful. That was just terrible.
[55:20.200 --> 55:21.940]  Oh, got up.
[55:27.130 --> 55:27.530]  Okay.
[55:32.280 --> 55:34.180]  You got four out of ten.
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.660]  So you mine.
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.020]  That's what I have.
[55:44.980 --> 55:46.080]  Oh, you have four out of ten?
[55:46.580 --> 55:48.620]  I guess. I got six out of ten now.
[55:51.980 --> 55:53.320]  Maybe it's me, Gavin.
[55:54.520 --> 55:55.380]  Yeah, I think it's the team.
[55:55.480 --> 55:55.940]  Yeah, I think that's the team.
[55:55.940 --> 55:56.380]  Okay.
[56:02.490 --> 56:03.050]  There's eight.
[56:05.470 --> 56:05.830]  Nine.
[56:06.270 --> 56:07.350]  Nine. One more.
[56:07.590 --> 56:07.810]  Oh.
[56:07.990 --> 56:10.470]  Oh, is this like a lost reference?
[56:10.650 --> 56:11.130]  Oh my god.
[56:11.890 --> 56:12.930]  There's a sub right here.
[56:14.810 --> 56:15.170]  Probably.
[56:15.850 --> 56:17.770]  I think there's some collectible in there.
[56:20.710 --> 56:22.190]  Am I going to have to go in the sub here in a second?
[56:22.550 --> 56:24.430]  Probably. I only have one more mine here. Give me a second.
[56:28.840 --> 56:32.320]  Yep. This is kind of far away. We're also cleaning it up.
[56:32.560 --> 56:33.640]  God, it's just really out here.
[56:34.560 --> 56:34.900]  Come on.
[56:36.120 --> 56:37.120]  You got it, Gavin?
[56:37.780 --> 56:38.500]  Here we go.
[56:39.600 --> 56:41.060]  I couldn't even see it.
[56:41.240 --> 56:41.520]  Got it. Got it.
[56:41.980 --> 56:42.360]  Ten.
[56:42.660 --> 56:42.960]  Nice.
[56:44.360 --> 56:44.900]  We're good.
[56:47.540 --> 56:48.340]  We're scanning.
[56:54.230 --> 56:54.710]  Okay.
[56:55.990 --> 56:57.650]  Gavin, let's go scan the wreckage.
[57:03.240 --> 57:04.600]  How do I scan?
[57:04.940 --> 57:06.260]  Just go over it.
[57:06.520 --> 57:06.840]  Oh, okay.
[57:09.600 --> 57:10.920]  Is that scanning?
[57:11.760 --> 57:12.020]  Yeah.
[57:16.960 --> 57:18.340]  Sounds like scanning to me.
[57:22.300 --> 57:24.920]  I mean, you're more than welcome to do your own scanning noises.
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.080]  Andrew won't do it. He won't scan.
[57:36.040 --> 57:38.140]  Who's the U-boat commander?
[57:39.740 --> 57:41.380]  All right. Wreckage scanned.
[57:43.640 --> 57:44.340]  John Connor.
[57:55.360 --> 57:57.980]  You sounded like you were underwater.
[57:59.560 --> 58:00.300]  Now what?
[58:01.060 --> 58:01.740]  You gotta go.
[58:02.760 --> 58:03.080]  Oh.
[58:04.860 --> 58:05.220]  Leave.
[58:08.460 --> 58:10.780]  I saw it. Well, I did it a second before that.
[58:10.980 --> 58:11.880]  You didn't see nothing, Nick.
[58:12.520 --> 58:13.840]  Oh, I enjoyed all of it.
[58:13.860 --> 58:14.260]  You didn't see nothing.
[58:14.600 --> 58:16.240]  Deliver the Strombo back to the stronghold.
[58:18.600 --> 58:19.600]  Wait for your team to leave.
[58:19.600 --> 58:21.660]  Oh, cool. I got like a shark's... My head's like a shark's fin.
[58:32.530 --> 58:32.890]  What?
[58:35.710 --> 58:36.550]  Almost out of the water.
[58:42.990 --> 58:43.710]  Oh, no.
[58:44.050 --> 58:44.410]  Stop.
[58:44.410 --> 58:44.590]  Stop!
[58:51.360 --> 58:51.400]  Wheels!
[58:56.440 --> 58:57.580]  And the drop-off.
[58:59.620 --> 59:00.940]  Oh, the drop-off's really close.
[59:03.400 --> 59:04.120]  Hittin' rocks.
[59:04.280 --> 59:06.960]  I thought it was gonna be so across the map. I'm so glad it's just right here.
[59:09.480 --> 59:10.400]  In Polito Bay?
[59:10.520 --> 59:10.900]  Mm-hmm.
[59:14.490 --> 59:16.550]  Remember when Gavin made us leave in Polito Bay?
[59:20.230 --> 59:21.630]  Okay, Mike, I'm here again.
[59:23.590 --> 59:25.050]  Oh, I'm on the wrong side of the wall.
[59:25.150 --> 59:25.350]  Yep!
[59:29.410 --> 59:30.290]  Missed the turn.
[59:30.750 --> 59:31.170]  Billy B.
[59:33.560 --> 59:34.320]  Nice stop.
[59:39.040 --> 59:39.780]  Thank you.
[59:49.870 --> 59:50.670]  Don't look scared.
[59:52.790 --> 59:53.210]  Oh!
[59:53.590 --> 59:54.110]  Holy shit!
[59:54.110 --> 59:55.370]  Oh, my God.
[59:55.910 --> 59:57.270]  Oh, my God.
[59:57.390 --> 59:57.990]  Holy shit.
[59:58.270 --> 59:59.230]  That was so...
[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.370]  I didn't think it would do that.
[01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:03.390]  That was fucking crazy.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.110]  That was awesome.
[01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:13.730]  Get in.
[01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:14.710]  Oh, that was cool.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.620]  My door!
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.600]  Surely won't be able to submarine if there's a door.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:27.960]  Gavin!
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.260]  Are we not... we're here, right?
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:30.720]  What are we doing?
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.460]  Is this it, or what?
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.560]  Wait for your team to deliver their Stromberg.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:37.420]  We're here, right?
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.300]  We're here.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.680]  Oh, no.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:40.940]  Do we get out?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:41.760]  Let's all get out.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.120]  I think it tells you to get back in.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.420]  Oh, get in the Stromberg.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.620]  In or out?
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.320]  In.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:49.580]  Okay.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.520]  Why would you listen to Nick about getting out?
[01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:56.170]  Oh, maybe we need to...
[01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.950]  I can't move my Stromberg anymore, so maybe you guys need to...
[01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.270]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.060]  We're all here.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.420]  When you get out, does it tell you to get back in?
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:15.320]  Yep.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.260]  It keeps giving me points like we beat the mission.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.080]  Huh.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:22.900]  I got it.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.340]  I think it's clutched.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.020]  I think it is.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.100]  Oh, man.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.120]  Blow it up, and then let's see how far back it puts us.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:35.440]  Okay.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:36.900]  Okay.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.860]  Because that should be mission failed, and then we'll see how far back it puts us.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.360]  Scan wreckage.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:47.680]  Okay.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.180]  Scan the submarine.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.840]  Hit it full speed.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:58.680]  Yep.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:00.940]  Make it!
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:01.900]  Make it!
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.960]  At least we don't have to blow up the mines or whatever.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:14.760]  It's just scanning.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.080]  The most boring part.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:16.940]  What's ocean?
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.240]  I hit the coral.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.000]  These reefs.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:24.960]  Oh.
[01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:30.870]  I didn't hear any scanning yet.
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:33.430]  Are you scanning?
[01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.490]  No.
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:36.070]  No, that's why he doesn't hear it yet either.
[01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.970]  No, it just felt accusatory the way you said it.
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:41.930]  I think maybe you're just being defensive, Nick.
[01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.130]  You know what?
[01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:45.430]  Yeah.
[01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:49.710]  No.
[01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.450]  No.
[01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:51.030]  Yeah.
[01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:51.930]  I was being defensive.
[01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:56.390]  I have acoustic signal.
[01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.650]  Play Wonderwall.
[01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:14.690]  Oh, what an insufferable bunch of bastards.
[01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:17.310]  And you know what?
[01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:18.110]  You started it.
[01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.610]  How funny.
[01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.310]  I didn't even hear Andrew scan.
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.730]  I'm just saying.
[01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:24.170]  I didn't either.
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:26.310]  I'm just going to be a whale this time.
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:29.750]  Here, I'm going to scan Gavin.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.140]  I'm scanning you, Gavin.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.000]  Was a whale looking for D.Va?
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.200]  Well, they've been talking to the whales about finding D.Va.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:41.960]  Oh.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.520]  That's what the movie's about.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:44.620]  Sorry.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.120]  Nice.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:48.740]  Thank you.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.780]  Now we know it's scanned.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.300]  We're on the last one.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.680]  We are done, so we're on our way out.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.060]  Oh, I hit the car.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.120]  All right, and away we go.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:12.700]  Well, at least the drop-off point's very close, so we'll know pretty quick if it works or not.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.940]  Awesome, you just kept getting points for me.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.180]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:22.460]  No wonder you leveled up.
[01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:31.270]  I'm just firing torpedoes up this guy's shorts.
[01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:35.490]  Talking about a bubble.
[01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:36.710]  Did he die from that?
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.030]  Did he die from a torpedo?
[01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.690]  I don't think I hit him, but I might have.
[01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.030]  Was it close to him?
[01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:43.810]  Yeah.
[01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:44.730]  Okay.
[01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:46.710]  Yeah.
[01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.190]  You all right, son?
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:55.890]  Oh yeah, I definitely hit him that time.
[01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:57.570]  All right, I'm in here.
[01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:58.790]  It says, wait for your team to deliver.
[01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.370]  I have a feeling it's going to be the same thing.
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:02.930]  No, not yet.
[01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:05.330]  I'm still...
[01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:07.510]  Deliver the Stromberg to drop-off.
[01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:08.650]  I'm on my way.
[01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:09.990]  Maybe we shouldn't blow shit up this time.
[01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:11.730]  Okay.
[01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:16.330]  Maybe we shouldn't ramp off the parked car at full speed.
[01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:17.430]  Yeah, I mean that.
[01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.710]  Yep.
[01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.650]  You're right.
[01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:21.570]  Didn't think that would happen.
[01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:25.470]  Yeah, I bet the mission ended, but then you were so far from the end that it unended and that was it.
[01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:26.930]  Yeah, I'll bet that was it.
[01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:28.750]  This time.
[01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.990]  Or will I?
[01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.710]  Magical tarp.
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.280]  Wait for your team.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.440]  Maybe back up.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.220]  Back up.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.840]  Get into a Stromberg.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.720]  I don't think we can beat this.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.980]  I think it's glitched.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:57.780]  I...
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:05:59.980]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.960]  It's showing me the orange circle for me still.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:02.880]  Or yellow circle.
[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:07.470]  Want to go ahead and Google it?
[01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:08.990]  I did.
[01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:15.430]  It's people saying that it's a glitch that they had, and then I didn't see anything that was super resolved.
[01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.390]  Alright, what if we all get out at the same time?
[01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:18.090]  Alright, ready?
[01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:19.090]  Three, two...
[01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.610]  Alright.
[01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.710]  Now what?
[01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:25.890]  I don't get in.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.720]  So does everyone... it says wait for your team for everyone, there's no one who has the...
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:34.900]  Yep.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.900]  For me it says get into a Stromberg.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.180]  For you it says that?
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.020]  Yes.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:39.860]  Oh.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.940]  Can you get in one of ours with us?
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.920]  Your shit's glitched.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.680]  Get in mine.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:47.440]  Oh!
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.060]  Whoa, what the fuck?
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.780]  That was crazy.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.220]  Gavin fell through the floor.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.220]  Oh shit.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.380]  Here we go, let's see.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.160]  Are you in a Stromberg now?
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.880]  Yeah, this one doesn't say... get in a... this one is a...
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.100]  Nope.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:02.820]  That one's done.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.470]  So if we're all in a different one...
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:07.700]  But he's...
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.780]  Wait for your team to deliver the Stromberg.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.800]  I think Andrew's car is glitched.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:18.580]  Eric, do it.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:19.880]  What do you want me to do?
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.240]  Fire the missile.
[01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:27.670]  Still the same.
[01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:29.090]  Okay.
[01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:31.470]  Oh god.
[01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:33.470]  I guess we'll have to...
[01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:39.510]  I think we just gotta fully reboot the mission at some point.
[01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.050]  Yep.
[01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.170]  Can we just pretend we've done it?
[01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.790]  Yeah.
[01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:43.430]  Yeah!
[01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:44.310]  Hey!
[01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:46.830]  Guys, we did it!
[01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:48.490]  Oh, oh, oh!
[01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:53.490]  Thank you so much for watching this gameplay heist video that didn't work.
[01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:56.850]  We'll be back with it fixed in the future!
[01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.950]  Just imagine that we did it.
[01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.910]  Imagine that everything went fine and it's done.
[01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:04.290]  Because we did do it.
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:05.290]  Exactly.
[01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:07.390]  Yep, problem solved.
[01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.230]  Well, thanks for watching.
[01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:09.230]  Check us out on Patreon.
[01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:10.310]  Check out the podcast.
[01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:11.610]  We appreciate it.
[01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:12.590]  And we'll see you later.
[01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.670]  Love you!
[01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:14.190]  Bye!
[01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:14.810]  Bye!
