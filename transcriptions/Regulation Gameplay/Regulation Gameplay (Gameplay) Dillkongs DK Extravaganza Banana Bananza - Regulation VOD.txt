[00:00.000 --> 00:01.660]  So this is a sausage gameplay.
[00:03.380 --> 00:04.300]  Sausage play.
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.080]  We all good? Do we have Twitch up?
[00:07.160 --> 00:08.500]  Yeah! It's rolling baby!
[00:08.520 --> 00:09.760]  We're good! We're good!
[00:09.960 --> 00:12.000]  I can punch? Can I punch?
[00:14.840 --> 00:16.620]  Looks good. Hell yeah.
[00:22.260 --> 00:24.440]  I got a little miner's hat.
[00:24.640 --> 00:25.580]  There he is, Dilkong himself.
[00:29.540 --> 00:30.060]  Bananas!
[00:30.060 --> 00:32.040]  I said, how are we looking and sounding?
[00:32.200 --> 00:33.960]  And someone just said yes. That's great.
[00:33.980 --> 00:34.600]  That's great.
[00:34.900 --> 00:40.580]  I keep watching the Cosmic Deployer video.
[00:40.760 --> 00:41.660]  It's so sick.
[00:42.320 --> 00:44.600]  Oh, this is a good game.
[00:44.940 --> 00:46.140]  This is already a good game.
[00:47.580 --> 00:49.200]  Have you beat off to it yet?
[00:50.600 --> 00:51.480]  No, not yet.
[00:52.540 --> 00:54.520]  Save that for later, that's why we're recording it.
[00:55.760 --> 00:56.640]  Hit R.
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.460]  The other R.
[01:01.020 --> 01:01.820]  That's L.
[01:02.620 --> 01:03.080]  There you go.
[01:03.220 --> 01:05.260]  That's how you can collect stuff on the ground faster.
[01:06.580 --> 01:08.000]  How much of this have you played?
[01:08.740 --> 01:09.260]  Me?
[01:09.600 --> 01:11.700]  I think I'm on the second level.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.740]  It's so big, it's insane.
[01:15.400 --> 01:17.020]  Give me these gold things!
[01:17.340 --> 01:18.260]  This is great.
[01:19.560 --> 01:21.640]  The gold stuff is everywhere.
[01:22.620 --> 01:23.140]  Everywhere.
[01:23.960 --> 01:25.640]  It's so crazy.
[01:26.640 --> 01:28.260]  There's so much in this game.
[01:28.320 --> 01:29.880]  It's outrageous, dude.
[01:33.640 --> 01:36.200]  Gameplay volume could be a little louder, Nick.
[01:44.100 --> 01:45.840]  It's definitely amateur hour.
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.580]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:53.940 --> 01:55.500]  We had everything set
[01:55.500 --> 01:58.160]  to the computers
[01:58.160 --> 01:59.680]  that we've been able to stream from.
[01:59.840 --> 02:01.420]  I think Andrew just needs a new computer.
[02:02.060 --> 02:02.500]  No!
[02:04.300 --> 02:06.080]  The thing we've been saying for
[02:06.080 --> 02:06.980]  nine months?
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.060]  His internet's great.
[02:10.280 --> 02:11.600]  That's awesome, that's great.
[02:12.040 --> 02:13.980]  Andrew, why don't we buy you a new computer?
[02:14.720 --> 02:15.420]  Yeah, we should do that.
[02:15.620 --> 02:16.100]  Let's do that.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.160]  I've already been really clear about how...
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.500]  I'll do that later today.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.120]  There you go.
[02:24.420 --> 02:26.140]  Do you know what you need to get?
[02:27.020 --> 02:28.200]  No, but I'll figure it out.
[02:28.260 --> 02:29.400]  I can talk to people.
[02:30.740 --> 02:32.040]  Yeah, I'm not gonna just
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.680]  fucking order a random computer.
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.820]  I got a Raspberry Pi, guys!
[02:35.900 --> 02:36.860]  This is gonna be great!
[02:38.160 --> 02:39.520]  It's about what you're running now.
[02:39.720 --> 02:40.300]  Where are we?
[02:41.960 --> 02:43.760]  I mean, I wish I could believe you.
[02:44.260 --> 02:45.480]  Yeah, I mean, yes.
[02:45.740 --> 02:47.280]  You're absolutely right, Joe.
[02:48.500 --> 02:49.780]  For the game or the computer?
[02:51.320 --> 02:51.820]  What happened?
[02:51.940 --> 02:52.420]  What am I missing?
[02:52.420 --> 02:53.420]  What do you mean?
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.040]  No, you don't have to.
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.080]  You just kinda keep going.
[02:59.220 --> 03:02.260]  Where am I supposed to go?
[03:02.480 --> 03:04.460]  Straight. Fucking straight.
[03:04.760 --> 03:05.760]  Oh, just keep going? Okay.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.720]  Banana mining site!
[03:10.640 --> 03:11.460]  What you got?
[03:11.920 --> 03:13.580]  It's like watching IGN do a review.
[03:19.180 --> 03:19.700]  Like,
[03:19.700 --> 03:21.560]  the language that
[03:21.560 --> 03:23.680]  the monkeys speak or all the characters speak
[03:23.680 --> 03:25.640]  in this is very weird. There's like a language
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.220]  to it.
[03:27.220 --> 03:28.180]  Thanks, Mr. Panda.
[03:31.140 --> 03:31.740]  It's weird
[03:31.740 --> 03:32.960]  seeing DK with pants.
[03:34.600 --> 03:35.600]  Yeah, there's
[03:35.600 --> 03:37.740]  a lot of dress-up dolly in this game
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.240]  though, so you don't have to worry about
[03:39.240 --> 03:41.780]  this is his outfit. There's a lot you can change
[03:41.780 --> 03:43.600]  and everything. It's pretty cool. You can give him different
[03:43.600 --> 03:45.800]  clothes, you can give him different ties, you can change the color of his hair.
[03:45.800 --> 03:46.300]  Oh, this is so good.
[03:46.300 --> 03:48.240]  Does he go cock-out
[03:48.240 --> 03:49.200]  at all?
[03:49.920 --> 03:52.260]  Well, yes and no.
[03:52.880 --> 03:53.720]  Because at
[03:54.270 --> 03:56.280]  one point he is not wearing pants, but
[03:56.280 --> 03:58.060]  you don't see nothing. So it's kind of like
[03:58.060 --> 03:59.540]  ultimately a disappointment.
[04:04.030 --> 04:06.080]  Okay. Where are some other bananas?
[04:06.560 --> 04:07.740]  I just want to break everything.
[04:08.560 --> 04:09.720]  Give me these banana coins.
[04:10.860 --> 04:12.140]  Everything just sounds
[04:12.140 --> 04:13.560]  good to collect as well.
[04:13.560 --> 04:14.920]  It's satisfying.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.540]  It's a very satisfying game.
[04:17.980 --> 04:19.680]  It was giving me like a little bit
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.580]  of motion sickness when I was first playing it because
[04:21.580 --> 04:22.980]  it is sort of like
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.560]  everywhere you go, the camera
[04:25.560 --> 04:26.380]  is like right on top.
[04:27.100 --> 04:28.540]  It's a little bit hard to
[04:29.340 --> 04:31.480]  look around at certain points.
[04:31.860 --> 04:33.120]  But dude, he loves eating bananas.
[04:33.180 --> 04:34.560]  This ape fucking loves eating bananas.
[04:35.840 --> 04:37.780]  After you're done talking to this guy,
[04:38.280 --> 04:38.420]  hold
[04:39.720 --> 04:40.200]  L.
[04:41.240 --> 04:41.800]  Okay.
[04:45.540 --> 04:47.860]  Okay, stop.
[04:48.240 --> 04:49.280]  The other L.
[04:52.480 --> 04:53.960]  He's whistling a song.
[04:54.920 --> 04:55.880]  Can you change the song?
[04:56.460 --> 04:58.020]  No, not that I know of.
[04:58.360 --> 04:58.840]  Bullshit.
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.940]  Hell yeah!
[05:06.360 --> 05:07.900]  You just go and go and go.
[05:07.900 --> 05:09.180]  It's so awesome.
[05:09.620 --> 05:11.080]  Thanks to Scott Steiner's
[05:11.960 --> 05:12.360]  Shoney's.
[05:12.980 --> 05:14.860]  I wonder if Scott Steiner owns a Shoney's.
[05:15.100 --> 05:16.380]  He does, but not anymore.
[05:16.680 --> 05:17.460]  I think it's out of business.
[05:18.680 --> 05:19.480]  Him and his brother.
[05:20.060 --> 05:21.500]  Rick Steiner, the dog-faced gremlin.
[05:22.040 --> 05:23.580]  When I was a kid, Shoney's was a big deal.
[05:24.680 --> 05:26.360]  Seems like Andrew, pound the ground.
[05:27.320 --> 05:27.640]  Hand slap.
[05:28.860 --> 05:31.160]  Oh, he looked real grumpy.
[05:31.460 --> 05:33.120]  Like a Left 4 Dead tank.
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.340]  There you go.
[05:35.340 --> 05:36.240]  Oh yeah, you did.
[05:38.860 --> 05:40.640]  It's sort of an imperfect science.
[05:41.480 --> 05:42.540]  I like it.
[05:42.620 --> 05:43.160]  Better than.
[05:46.640 --> 05:47.280]  Careful, man.
[05:47.340 --> 05:48.260]  Ape must not kill ape.
[05:48.980 --> 05:50.960]  Oh, these apes?
[05:51.140 --> 05:51.680]  Strong together.
[05:54.400 --> 05:55.160]  You know what I started
[05:55.160 --> 05:55.820]  watching last night?
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.840]  The new season of It's Always Sunny.
[05:59.640 --> 06:00.320]  Oh, is it good?
[06:00.800 --> 06:02.760]  It's not bad. I watched the first two episodes.
[06:02.760 --> 06:05.160]  It was better than I thought it would be.
[06:05.400 --> 06:06.000]  What's his name back?
[06:06.000 --> 06:07.480]  For season 17.
[06:09.120 --> 06:11.140]  Didn't Glenn Howard leave for a while?
[06:11.780 --> 06:12.780]  Glenn Howard didn't like...
[06:12.780 --> 06:14.200]  Yeah, he was... Not really.
[06:14.640 --> 06:16.360]  They wrote him out, but then he came back.
[06:21.660 --> 06:23.060]  He's like, I'm going on my own.
[06:23.340 --> 06:24.200]  And then everyone was like,
[06:25.320 --> 06:26.420]  we're going to keep doing this.
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.840]  And he's like, well, I want to keep doing this.
[06:29.460 --> 06:30.620]  You're supposed to stop too.
[06:30.620 --> 06:31.340]  Yeah, exactly.
[06:31.920 --> 06:33.600]  And a podcast about it? I'm back.
[06:34.460 --> 06:35.940]  I think they stopped that.
[06:36.060 --> 06:37.420]  Yeah, they cancelled the podcast.
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.360]  Did they really?
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.480]  Our schedules are too fucked.
[06:43.720 --> 06:46.200]  You sounded almost disappointed or shocked,
[06:46.320 --> 06:48.140]  but I think that happened like two years ago.
[06:48.520 --> 06:50.120]  That was not current news.
[06:50.340 --> 06:51.320]  It was a little while ago.
[06:51.540 --> 06:53.600]  And they also did a bunch of episodes.
[06:53.780 --> 06:55.100]  They probably have over 100 episodes.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.200]  Plenty of material to dive through.
[06:59.200 --> 06:59.960]  What is that?
[07:01.300 --> 07:01.840]  Some fruit.
[07:05.160 --> 07:06.140]  Yeah, take that.
[07:08.500 --> 07:10.000]  Oh, I saved you?
[07:10.280 --> 07:10.740]  Yeah, right.
[07:10.980 --> 07:11.920]  Nick, are you of interest in this game?
[07:12.620 --> 07:13.800]  Yeah, a lot of it.
[07:14.180 --> 07:15.060]  This looks great.
[07:16.460 --> 07:17.760]  I loved Odyssey.
[07:18.140 --> 07:19.600]  It took me a while to get into it, though.
[07:19.800 --> 07:23.280]  This really scratches your
[07:23.280 --> 07:24.300]  last of those two itch.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.200]  Not quite that one, but...
[07:28.220 --> 07:28.860]  Monkey Meals.
[07:29.420 --> 07:30.860]  Monkey Meals? Oh my God.
[07:31.620 --> 07:33.540]  I was working out with Blaine this morning
[07:33.540 --> 07:34.740]  and he was talking about how far
[07:34.740 --> 07:36.480]  his girlfriend had gotten in the game.
[07:36.540 --> 07:38.960]  He's like, yeah, dude, and this hot ape was on the screen
[07:38.960 --> 07:41.100]  and then some other apes were there.
[07:41.180 --> 07:42.780]  But dude, this hot ape was there,
[07:42.860 --> 07:44.400]  and I'm just like, yeah, that's her.
[07:45.020 --> 07:47.320]  He's like, oh my God, and she just shows up
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.680]  and it's like this hot ape is there.
[07:48.840 --> 07:51.520]  And it's like, alright, let's stop saying it.
[07:51.540 --> 07:52.860]  I was going to make a joke about how
[07:52.860 --> 07:54.240]  I thought you were going to say that
[07:54.820 --> 07:56.220]  Blaine was talking about
[07:56.220 --> 07:58.020]  how he wants to bang apes, but then you kind of did.
[07:58.220 --> 07:59.980]  Yeah, and then that was the point of the story.
[08:00.380 --> 08:02.020]  Yeah, it was like leg day
[08:02.020 --> 08:04.700]  and we're doing squats, and he's like, yeah, and then the hot ape shows up.
[08:05.660 --> 08:06.760]  Okay, thanks, man.
[08:09.680 --> 08:10.520]  Uh-oh!
[08:12.960 --> 08:14.160]  I think it's bullshit.
[08:14.160 --> 08:16.060]  It's getting sucked into an Illumination movie.
[08:17.220 --> 08:18.200]  I think it's bullshit
[08:18.200 --> 08:20.020]  that DK only has a couple outfits
[08:20.020 --> 08:21.020]  in Mario Kart.
[08:22.200 --> 08:23.300]  Only one, right?
[08:23.620 --> 08:24.700]  Yes, he only has one other one.
[08:24.980 --> 08:26.340]  I assume it's DLC.
[08:26.760 --> 08:28.920]  They gotta do DLC or something for it.
[08:29.180 --> 08:31.040]  Because it's gotta be tied into this game.
[08:31.500 --> 08:31.600]  Right?
[08:32.340 --> 08:33.120]  I would hope so.
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.020]  Because I think Pauline only has
[08:37.020 --> 08:37.860]  one outfit also.
[08:39.120 --> 08:40.360]  Is that a planet drill?
[08:41.700 --> 08:42.860]  It looked like it.
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.080]  Yeah, it was a planet drill. It's from the hot ape.
[08:45.800 --> 08:46.640]  Thanks, Jakester.
[08:46.960 --> 08:48.600]  If we were streaming this, I would have spent
[08:48.600 --> 08:50.540]  like an hour and a half just getting all the gold.
[08:50.780 --> 08:52.400]  You have done the right thing.
[08:52.780 --> 08:54.380]  You're being mindful of
[08:54.380 --> 08:56.400]  being on for this thing, because
[08:56.400 --> 08:58.420]  dude, it is...
[08:58.420 --> 09:00.360]  I spent so much time in that first spot,
[09:00.500 --> 09:02.400]  and there's so much more game, it's so insane.
[09:04.360 --> 09:06.100]  DK Donkey Kong will not rot in her mushy.
[09:06.180 --> 09:07.800]  This strong Kong will eat any...
[09:07.800 --> 09:10.280]  Did anybody else eat a banana today at IRL? I did.
[09:10.860 --> 09:11.400]  No, not yet.
[09:11.800 --> 09:12.980]  No, I just ran out.
[09:13.400 --> 09:16.240]  Oh! The Dr. Mouse, guys.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.340]  The Dr. Mouse was up.
[09:18.340 --> 09:19.180]  The Dr. Mouse.
[09:19.320 --> 09:21.680]  Dr. Doctor, give me the news.
[09:21.800 --> 09:24.720]  I got a bad case of Dr. Strange.
[09:28.120 --> 09:30.120]  You know how DK dabs
[09:30.120 --> 09:31.260]  in Mario Kart?
[09:31.720 --> 09:33.760]  I don't know,
[09:34.340 --> 09:36.120]  but Archie has started dabbing.
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.040]  Whoa!
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.380]  I'll just randomly do it, and I'm like,
[09:39.500 --> 09:41.740]  is this from DK, or are you learning this at school?
[09:41.860 --> 09:42.860]  What is going on here?
[09:42.860 --> 09:43.420]  It's gotta be both.
[09:43.500 --> 09:44.460]  It's definitely both.
[09:46.200 --> 09:47.780]  Look, see, he's not wearing clothes anymore.
[09:48.680 --> 09:50.260]  He lost his pants in the accident.
[09:50.500 --> 09:51.360]  Stick out.
[09:52.060 --> 09:53.440]  It's like Andrew recording a podcast.
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.540]  He never started with them.
[09:58.260 --> 09:58.860]  It's true.
[10:01.240 --> 10:02.400]  We should have...
[10:02.400 --> 10:04.840]  You know how we did the bottomless
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.040]  only podcast that one time?
[10:06.560 --> 10:08.360]  We should do a tie only podcast.
[10:09.540 --> 10:10.280]  It's rough.
[10:10.280 --> 10:12.080]  I don't know if I've ever
[10:12.080 --> 10:13.820]  worn a tie. I don't think I have.
[10:14.880 --> 10:15.820]  Do you own a tie?
[10:16.760 --> 10:18.540]  No, I definitely don't own one.
[10:19.160 --> 10:20.080]  Maybe when I went to a wedding
[10:20.080 --> 10:22.360]  when I was like 5 or 6.
[10:22.860 --> 10:23.640]  Do you think I was a clip-on?
[10:24.900 --> 10:25.960]  I don't know.
[10:27.260 --> 10:28.360]  I've definitely never
[10:28.360 --> 10:29.540]  worn one in my adult life.
[10:29.660 --> 10:31.820]  So this is gonna be a pretty big deal for you
[10:31.820 --> 10:32.940]  when we do this episode. It will be.
[10:34.800 --> 10:36.240]  Hey audience, save that
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.120]  for the bit barrel.
[10:38.520 --> 10:39.220]  So we don't
[10:39.220 --> 10:41.020]  I can't be bothered to write it down myself.
[10:41.020 --> 10:43.300]  Dude, you've been putting in
[10:43.300 --> 10:43.660]  work.
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.180]  You've been putting in work on the bit barrel.
[10:46.400 --> 10:49.160]  The bit barrel is pretty much done other than my bad job
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.320]  of overspray.
[10:51.120 --> 10:53.220]  It was just hard to get the stencil to lay flat.
[10:53.660 --> 10:54.300]  It looked good though.
[10:55.180 --> 10:56.400]  Yeah, the photos you've shared.
[10:56.560 --> 10:57.820]  I thought it was rad.
[10:59.240 --> 11:00.040]  Gross, Andrew.
[11:02.340 --> 11:03.060]  Wait till you
[11:03.060 --> 11:04.360]  hear what I do with my ass.
[11:04.360 --> 11:04.780]  No!
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.320]  Right into the mic.
[11:08.180 --> 11:09.260]  Me and DK.
[11:10.520 --> 11:10.980]  Thank you.
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.500]  Escape the cave-in.
[11:14.620 --> 11:16.300]  So it sounded like a Terrain Difficulty
[11:16.300 --> 11:18.000]  1. Have you experienced
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.920]  Difficulty 2 yet, Eric? I am.
[11:19.980 --> 11:22.160]  I'm on Terrain Difficulty 2 currently.
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.280]  Is that like a level indicator, essentially?
[11:24.420 --> 11:25.700]  Yeah, essentially.
[11:26.760 --> 11:27.760]  There's a lot of upgrades.
[11:27.840 --> 11:28.880]  Hit up on the D-pad.
[11:30.680 --> 11:31.820]  So these are your upgrades.
[11:31.820 --> 11:32.560]  Whoa!
[11:32.560 --> 11:35.600]  You get skill points by collecting bananas.
[11:36.500 --> 11:38.300]  And the punch power
[11:38.300 --> 11:40.300]  is like, okay, you can
[11:40.300 --> 11:41.720]  cut through stuff faster.
[11:42.500 --> 11:43.660]  There's a better
[11:43.660 --> 11:45.120]  sonar for stuff.
[11:46.060 --> 11:47.200]  It's pretty neat.
[11:47.660 --> 11:50.120]  And there's a lot of stuff that you can unlock later.
[11:50.680 --> 11:52.200]  Oh, some Funky Kong shit?
[11:52.280 --> 11:53.000]  Oh yeah, big time.
[11:54.140 --> 11:56.100]  Is there a DK gun?
[11:56.960 --> 11:57.980]  Edward Scissorhands,
[11:58.120 --> 11:58.520]  thank you.
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.700]  So far, there's not a DK gun.
[12:00.940 --> 12:01.340]  Okay.
[12:02.100 --> 12:03.820]  He had it in the 64 game.
[12:04.060 --> 12:04.940]  He did.
[12:06.480 --> 12:08.500]  Yeah, the dual wielding, the banana guns.
[12:09.200 --> 12:10.540]  I have seen the Rhino.
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.700]  You gotta start
[12:12.700 --> 12:14.760]  breaking everything, dude. You gotta start punching shit.
[12:15.060 --> 12:16.520]  Like, bust it down. Don't stop.
[12:16.680 --> 12:17.300]  Okay, grab the balloon.
[12:18.580 --> 12:20.140]  It's like if you ever fall on an edge.
[12:20.480 --> 12:20.740]  Come back.
[12:21.140 --> 12:24.500]  Oh my god, Arthritic
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.400]  Gamer here with the 10 gifted subs.
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.340]  Thank you so much, Arthritic Gamer.
[12:28.620 --> 12:29.760]  We'll play for you.
[12:31.040 --> 12:32.140]  Rest your hands.
[12:33.100 --> 12:34.180]  This is crazy.
[12:36.840 --> 12:37.500]  Holy shit.
[12:37.600 --> 12:39.060]  This is so cool.
[12:39.580 --> 12:41.780]  It gave me some motion sickness
[12:41.780 --> 12:44.460]  because you just start like...
[12:44.460 --> 12:45.600]  You don't know what's going on.
[12:46.640 --> 12:47.700]  Don't touch those.
[12:48.020 --> 12:49.560]  Are those hot peppers?
[12:49.900 --> 12:51.360]  No, it's thorns.
[12:51.660 --> 12:53.120]  Don't go that way.
[12:53.120 --> 12:55.540]  What don't you understand about
[12:55.540 --> 12:56.220]  don't touch those?
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.620]  Because there's gold in it.
[12:58.780 --> 13:01.020]  So, don't touch those
[13:01.020 --> 13:02.420]  means what to you?
[13:03.340 --> 13:04.760]  It means don't touch those
[13:04.760 --> 13:05.880]  when it's all pointy and stuff.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.620]  Can you jump over it?
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.980]  No, hang on. Grab shit out of the ground.
[13:13.200 --> 13:14.340]  And then hit Y.
[13:15.100 --> 13:15.300]  Nope.
[13:18.020 --> 13:18.380]  I see.
[13:18.740 --> 13:20.640]  You're hitting X. You want to hit Y button.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.320]  Cool. Good work.
[13:22.980 --> 13:24.800]  Really cool. Really awesome.
[13:25.160 --> 13:26.760]  In my defense, that's Y
[13:26.760 --> 13:27.620]  on an Xbox controller.
[13:29.640 --> 13:31.000]  It's a different button
[13:31.000 --> 13:31.820]  on this controller.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.840]  Andrew, I'm on your side there.
[13:34.640 --> 13:36.280]  See, that's exactly what was happening
[13:36.280 --> 13:37.300]  with Tony Hawk.
[13:39.960 --> 13:42.240]  Hey, Andrew, you're just like Nick
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.460]  playing Tony Hawk right now.
[13:44.220 --> 13:46.260]  I'm with him. I understand.
[13:52.560 --> 13:57.800]  You got a banana in here?
[13:58.620 --> 14:00.520]  You hold bananas back here?
[14:01.080 --> 14:02.320]  More gold stuff everywhere.
[14:02.740 --> 14:04.860]  You kind of want to jam on that R button.
[14:05.240 --> 14:06.380]  Like the ground slap.
[14:06.920 --> 14:08.240]  Because it's the...
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.320]  Yeah, collect a lot of stuff.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.440]  And there's stuff around you.
[14:13.780 --> 14:16.160]  There's a comment on the Gerpler reveal
[14:16.160 --> 14:16.240]  that says,
[14:17.040 --> 14:18.240]  Can't wait to see this
[14:18.240 --> 14:19.080]  on Awesome News.
[14:23.880 --> 14:24.440]  Awesome.
[14:25.800 --> 14:27.120]  That's like the top.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.120]  So what do I use the gold for?
[14:29.340 --> 14:32.440]  You don't use anything for it in the first two levels.
[14:32.580 --> 14:34.120]  I actually just got to the point
[14:34.120 --> 14:35.760]  where you use it.
[14:35.900 --> 14:38.040]  And it's to unlock stuff.
[14:39.080 --> 14:39.600]  Got it.
[14:40.800 --> 14:41.660]  Into the balloon.
[14:48.670 --> 14:49.610]  It's stunning.
[14:49.770 --> 14:50.470]  It tells you the button.
[14:52.050 --> 14:53.370]  It's really stunning.
[14:55.010 --> 14:56.630]  There you go.
[14:59.250 --> 15:00.730]  Oh, brakes, brakes.
[15:00.930 --> 15:01.790]  Oh, I hurt my thumb.
[15:03.010 --> 15:03.670]  This way.
[15:04.650 --> 15:06.290]  Donkey Kong Country shit.
[15:10.150 --> 15:10.570]  Whoa.
[15:11.090 --> 15:12.030]  What's up, man?
[15:14.390 --> 15:15.310]  Sure did.
[15:17.830 --> 15:19.290]  Check on the folks
[15:19.290 --> 15:21.050]  in town, but this other barrel ain't
[15:21.050 --> 15:22.890]  working. Oh, no.
[15:23.030 --> 15:24.710]  I'm like, man,
[15:24.850 --> 15:27.190]  this game is just so good. It's really
[15:28.190 --> 15:28.670]  crazy.
[15:28.910 --> 15:30.210]  And it looks so good.
[15:30.570 --> 15:32.390]  It's got some Halo vibes here.
[15:32.970 --> 15:34.430]  Oh, the color? Yeah.
[15:34.770 --> 15:37.190]  Sort of like a little sniper
[15:37.190 --> 15:38.870]  nest out in the desert.
[15:40.410 --> 15:41.070]  And if
[15:41.070 --> 15:43.010]  you're just watching this now, like if you didn't join
[15:43.010 --> 15:43.590]  us earlier,
[15:44.410 --> 15:45.610]  we did announce the
[15:45.610 --> 15:47.530]  Cosmic Gurgler that'll be out on August 1st
[15:47.530 --> 15:49.630]  at 1pm Central. You can go on our
[15:49.630 --> 15:51.490]  social media or on our YouTube channel and
[15:51.490 --> 15:53.350]  watch the video. The video
[15:53.350 --> 15:54.470]  was actually
[15:55.890 --> 15:57.550]  created by Slow Mo Guys
[15:57.550 --> 15:58.870]  own Gavin Free.
[15:59.510 --> 16:01.450]  I thought Dan did that one. And
[16:01.450 --> 16:03.530]  the launch went off without
[16:03.530 --> 16:05.610]  a hitch. It was perfect in every way.
[16:06.050 --> 16:07.750]  Yep. Just in case you missed it.
[16:08.610 --> 16:09.550]  There were zero technical
[16:09.550 --> 16:10.610]  problems. Yep.
[16:17.000 --> 16:17.700]  What is that?
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.900]  Oh, it's Pauline. Covenant Purple.
[16:19.300 --> 16:21.340]  Yeah. What is that? It's Pauline.
[16:21.460 --> 16:23.060]  And it says Void. Void.
[16:23.660 --> 16:25.020]  It's Voidine. Xur.
[16:27.520 --> 16:29.280]  Voidine. Voidine Xur.
[16:31.500 --> 16:32.200]  It's a rock.
[16:35.760 --> 16:36.980]  It was very funny where when
[16:36.980 --> 16:38.860]  they first showed this game, people were like, I don't know
[16:38.860 --> 16:40.980]  about this rock. And then later it's
[16:40.980 --> 16:42.160]  like, oh, it's Pauline. Cool.
[16:42.660 --> 16:43.640]  I'm fine with this.
[16:45.760 --> 16:46.940]  But the timeline!
[16:47.340 --> 16:48.400]  It doesn't make any sense!
[16:48.780 --> 16:50.300]  Oh, my Morg's 5 gifted. Thank you.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.240]  Almost looks like Gilbot.
[16:52.520 --> 16:53.320]  It does.
[16:55.600 --> 16:56.760]  Once you gain the ability
[16:56.760 --> 16:58.600]  to jump from thing to thing, it's truly
[16:58.600 --> 16:59.400]  over for us.
[17:02.020 --> 17:02.540]  And you got those
[17:02.540 --> 17:03.840]  spring-loaded legs, man. It's crazy.
[17:06.040 --> 17:06.720]  Where you going?
[17:07.540 --> 17:08.140]  Get back here!
[17:09.420 --> 17:10.220]  Get back here!
[17:12.280 --> 17:13.340]  I'm gonna chase him down, baby.
[17:15.640 --> 17:16.120]  Oh!
[17:16.800 --> 17:17.640]  Uh-oh.
[17:18.580 --> 17:19.180]  You gotta help him out.
[17:23.260 --> 17:25.060]  You're a big fan of punching straight up.
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.340]  Sure am.
[17:27.360 --> 17:28.580]  It's the DK way.
[17:29.940 --> 17:31.240]  I don't know that it is.
[17:31.420 --> 17:32.560]  I don't know that it is.
[17:32.720 --> 17:35.360]  I'm Dilkong, and I'm playing as Donkey Kong, so I'm pretty sure
[17:35.360 --> 17:37.200]  it is. It's true.
[17:37.700 --> 17:38.920]  The credentials are
[17:39.480 --> 17:39.960]  immaculate.
[17:39.960 --> 17:41.620]  Look at how Dilkong, how DK punches.
[17:41.940 --> 17:43.060]  It checks out, man.
[17:45.880 --> 17:46.960]  I love the way he looks.
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.200]  I love the way this character looks.
[17:49.420 --> 17:50.640]  I think he's so cool.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.740]  Look at him. Look at him go.
[17:54.840 --> 17:56.180]  Somebody said you gotta punch up
[17:56.180 --> 17:56.920]  to Dil down.
[18:10.940 --> 18:12.600]  Looks like a Homestar Runner character.
[18:13.500 --> 18:14.700]  I can see it, yeah.
[18:14.920 --> 18:15.080]  It's pretty funny.
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.040]  Oh my god, yeah.
[18:18.440 --> 18:19.460]  All Jordan swears.
[18:23.920 --> 18:25.120]  I saw Jordan at
[18:25.120 --> 18:27.080]  Costco yesterday, and we were both buying
[18:27.080 --> 18:27.820]  this game.
[18:29.380 --> 18:30.200]  Did they have
[18:30.920 --> 18:32.120]  Switch 2s, by any chance?
[18:32.400 --> 18:35.060]  I didn't see any. They might have, but
[18:35.060 --> 18:36.800]  I didn't see any. I was also very
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.880]  laser-focused on getting the game, so I didn't really look
[18:38.880 --> 18:39.380]  very much.
[18:42.140 --> 18:43.080]  I also got pizza.
[18:45.300 --> 18:46.140]  What type of pizza?
[18:47.440 --> 18:49.300]  The pepperoni. Do you think
[18:49.300 --> 18:51.080]  is the cheese pizza better than
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.880]  the pepperoni? Is their cheese pizza the best
[18:52.880 --> 18:54.240]  pizza there? No.
[18:54.660 --> 18:56.980]  You don't think so? No, I would never get a cheese pizza.
[18:58.280 --> 18:59.000]  It is
[18:59.000 --> 18:59.900]  way cheesier.
[19:01.160 --> 19:02.440]  I really like it.
[19:02.720 --> 19:04.920]  That guides you. That's cool. I need pepperoni.
[19:05.600 --> 19:06.400]  I hear you.
[19:07.660 --> 19:09.100]  It's what I always end up getting, and then
[19:09.100 --> 19:11.040]  my wife got the cheese, and I took some bites of that,
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.640]  and I went, oh, dang.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.980]  They're both solid.
[19:17.280 --> 19:18.740]  Cheese is greener on the other
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.580]  slice? Oh, yeah.
[19:20.740 --> 19:22.100]  Cheese is always green.
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.380]  I've started ordering
[19:24.380 --> 19:26.920]  full pizzas from there instead of just a slice.
[19:27.700 --> 19:28.500]  It's the way to go.
[19:33.770 --> 19:34.210]  Whoa!
[19:42.820 --> 19:45.220]  The one I went to has a calzone now?
[19:46.440 --> 19:46.880]  Really?
[19:47.120 --> 19:49.240]  Yeah, there was a thing that's like, hey, we do
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.120]  a calzone, like, when you went to, like, check out.
[19:51.600 --> 19:52.880]  Like, hey, you want a calzone?
[19:53.260 --> 19:54.420]  And it's like, uh, no.
[19:55.700 --> 19:57.100]  You're going up north, right, Nick?
[19:57.860 --> 19:59.240]  Yeah. I kind of want to see
[19:59.240 --> 19:59.800]  if it's good or not.
[20:00.420 --> 20:03.020]  I've been hitting up that south Costco, which would be
[20:03.020 --> 20:03.840]  pretty far for you.
[20:04.920 --> 20:06.960]  That was my Costco back in the day.
[20:09.060 --> 20:10.440]  That one's pretty far south, though.
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.140]  Where'd our bananas go? Probably this way.
[20:14.780 --> 20:15.140]  Don't...
[20:15.140 --> 20:17.420]  I'm pretty central, so no, like, equidistant
[20:19.020 --> 20:19.420]  Yeah.
[20:19.560 --> 20:21.240]  Punch through the back. Punch through the wall.
[20:23.980 --> 20:25.640]  You can tear this whole place up.
[20:25.740 --> 20:27.480]  Until you hit concrete, you can just fucking go
[20:27.480 --> 20:28.420]  bananas, dude.
[20:31.040 --> 20:32.300]  Georgetown got one recently.
[20:33.740 --> 20:34.500]  Fucking Georgetown.
[20:35.600 --> 20:36.700]  Hey, wait, go back.
[20:37.460 --> 20:38.980]  Go back to that fountain thing.
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.460]  I just feel like
[20:41.460 --> 20:43.520]  I was talking about this when I was in Michigan.
[20:43.900 --> 20:45.720]  I feel like I need to hate more stuff right now.
[20:45.720 --> 20:47.060]  I don't feel like I hate enough.
[20:48.140 --> 20:48.940]  Oh, interesting.
[20:50.260 --> 20:51.040]  Do the clap.
[20:52.660 --> 20:53.740]  You're too satisfied
[20:53.740 --> 20:55.740]  with life. Yeah, I just like
[20:55.740 --> 20:57.680]  I do better when I have a
[20:57.680 --> 20:58.840]  nemesis, you know?
[21:00.380 --> 21:01.620]  I need something to
[21:01.620 --> 21:03.960]  I need spite to carry me in a direction.
[21:07.840 --> 21:09.720]  What do you think you could be hating on better?
[21:10.560 --> 21:11.420]  I'm sorry, what did you say?
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.720]  What do you think you could be hating on better?
[21:14.480 --> 21:16.120]  I need to identify
[21:16.120 --> 21:16.700]  an enemy.
[21:20.440 --> 21:21.720]  I can't have an enemy
[21:21.720 --> 21:22.580]  everywhere I go.
[21:28.100 --> 21:29.540]  Dwight, sit down. Listen to this.
[21:29.680 --> 21:30.340]  I need an enemy.
[21:32.380 --> 21:33.700]  I don't feel like I have an Austin
[21:33.700 --> 21:35.300]  enemy right now.
[21:43.790 --> 21:44.190]  Yeah.
[21:44.190 --> 21:45.970]  Oh, eat shit.
[21:46.870 --> 21:47.890]  Gold, gold, gold, gold.
[21:49.150 --> 21:50.130]  Totally annoyed and said
[21:50.130 --> 21:51.750]  I call dibs. Fuck you, Geoff.
[21:51.990 --> 21:54.390]  That just makes me
[21:54.390 --> 21:56.130]  love you more. I'm gonna turn the other
[21:56.130 --> 21:56.430]  cheek.
[21:59.010 --> 22:00.110]  I do have enemies in
[22:00.110 --> 22:00.530]  River City.
[22:03.330 --> 22:04.310]  Are any of them
[22:04.310 --> 22:05.590]  international or is it all pretty
[22:06.190 --> 22:08.110]  domestic? Emily and I were talking
[22:08.110 --> 22:10.250]  about it. I like to have an enemy everywhere I go.
[22:10.650 --> 22:11.510]  I probably do. Oh, that's fun.
[22:11.510 --> 22:12.610]  That's pretty cool.
[22:13.650 --> 22:15.470]  There's one dude in Michigan I hate
[22:15.470 --> 22:16.950]  right now. Oh, yeah?
[22:17.510 --> 22:18.930]  You want to talk about him at all?
[22:19.550 --> 22:21.710]  It's not fair to him. He doesn't even know me.
[22:22.170 --> 22:23.450]  Oh, okay. I just see him
[22:23.450 --> 22:25.130]  around and he runs me the wrong way.
[22:25.790 --> 22:27.290]  Oh. Don't you
[22:27.290 --> 22:29.530]  kind of have an enemy in Austin with the coffee
[22:29.530 --> 22:31.590]  shop situation? Yeah. The person kept walking
[22:31.590 --> 22:33.170]  into there that you didn't want to?
[22:33.290 --> 22:34.110]  I guess that's true.
[22:38.320 --> 22:40.080]  I have still not been back to that
[22:40.080 --> 22:41.580]  coffee shop. Really?
[22:41.580 --> 22:43.140]  That was so long ago.
[22:43.420 --> 22:45.780]  It no longer exists. What if you both
[22:45.780 --> 22:47.400]  did the exact same thing and neither of you
[22:47.400 --> 22:49.220]  go to it anymore? Fuck you.
[22:49.300 --> 22:50.580]  I feel bad for the coffee shop.
[22:52.520 --> 22:53.620]  I can only
[22:53.620 --> 22:55.900]  control my
[22:55.900 --> 22:56.440]  neurosis.
[22:58.120 --> 22:59.680]  We're still in the middle of
[22:59.680 --> 23:01.560]  this season of Good Morning Gus
[23:01.560 --> 23:03.460]  and we just had the episode where we do two
[23:03.460 --> 23:05.260]  coffee shops in one go.
[23:05.460 --> 23:07.640]  And the audio splits left
[23:07.640 --> 23:09.660]  channel, right channel when we split up in groups.
[23:09.660 --> 23:12.080]  It's pretty good. Richard did a really good job.
[23:12.400 --> 23:12.940]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[23:16.760 --> 23:17.960]  I didn't copy it.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.140]  I just want to be clear about that.
[23:19.420 --> 23:21.820]  No, you did. For 100% need it's very good. You did it.
[23:22.220 --> 23:22.400]  Okay.
[23:24.660 --> 23:25.900]  It just seemed like the best way
[23:25.900 --> 23:27.820]  to split the conversation. You did a great job.
[23:28.200 --> 23:28.700]  By yourself.
[23:29.180 --> 23:30.400]  I don't care about you.
[23:31.280 --> 23:31.640]  Oh!
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.520]  The way you play video
[23:41.520 --> 23:43.140]  games is like really nuts to me.
[23:43.300 --> 23:45.300]  He's just mashing. He's flying.
[23:45.460 --> 23:47.120]  Yeah, Andrew, I fucking know.
[23:47.720 --> 23:48.700]  Just flying by.
[23:49.600 --> 23:50.280]  That face!
[23:51.460 --> 23:51.900]  Oh!
[23:57.270 --> 23:57.970]  I saw
[23:57.970 --> 23:59.810]  cars in New Jersey. Would you like me to
[23:59.810 --> 24:01.990]  rip you and Emily off on a third row SUV?
[24:04.550 --> 24:05.330]  Alright, guy.
[24:06.030 --> 24:08.090]  I got my sights on you, buddy.
[24:09.010 --> 24:10.150]  You son of a bitch.
[24:11.010 --> 24:11.710]  That's pretty good.
[24:11.710 --> 24:13.090]  I like that.
[24:13.250 --> 24:15.850]  How much has Roadcraft altered your brain?
[24:16.070 --> 24:17.530]  Dude, I fucking love...
[24:17.530 --> 24:18.810]  That's the best video game ever made.
[24:19.350 --> 24:20.290]  I'm calling it now.
[24:21.010 --> 24:23.250]  I hope it never is. I caught myself thinking
[24:23.770 --> 24:24.850]  what am I going to do
[24:24.850 --> 24:27.550]  when I finish it and there's no
[24:27.550 --> 24:29.030]  DLC or anything to play and I thought
[24:29.030 --> 24:30.630]  I'll just delete it and start over.
[24:31.090 --> 24:32.110]  And then I realized
[24:32.110 --> 24:34.630]  I don't like to do things twice.
[24:37.510 --> 24:39.490]  It's going to take you a long time to finish that game.
[24:39.490 --> 24:40.970]  Yeah, for sure.
[24:41.810 --> 24:43.370]  I'd say maybe a little less than halfway through.
[24:44.650 --> 24:45.350]  You know,
[24:45.550 --> 24:47.550]  it's going to be really funny when people
[24:47.550 --> 24:49.390]  watch the first video we did in that game
[24:49.390 --> 24:51.170]  where it took you some warming up.
[24:53.030 --> 24:55.530]  Oh, Geoff, you know what?
[24:56.150 --> 24:56.810]  Probably not.
[24:57.950 --> 24:59.790]  We got onion rings in an air fryer.
[25:00.470 --> 25:01.450]  Dude, we do have
[25:01.450 --> 25:03.450]  onion rings in an air fryer and time to kill.
[25:03.850 --> 25:05.510]  Dude, you think I should get some of those going?
[25:05.770 --> 25:06.750]  I think we probably should.
[25:06.750 --> 25:08.570]  I mean, we bought that air fryer for a reason.
[25:09.690 --> 25:10.730]  Yeah, you did.
[25:10.810 --> 25:11.870]  You should do it.
[25:14.010 --> 25:14.790]  I can hear
[25:14.790 --> 25:16.130]  the jealousy in Nick's voice.
[25:16.370 --> 25:16.730]  No!
[25:18.850 --> 25:19.890]  Eric knows you're pissed.
[25:21.750 --> 25:24.590]  I just find it funny that he happened to wait
[25:24.590 --> 25:25.790]  until I'm not there to do it.
[25:26.150 --> 25:28.510]  He's not mad, he just finds it funny he waited
[25:28.510 --> 25:29.290]  until he's not here.
[25:31.350 --> 25:32.590]  Regulation rings, hell yeah.
[25:33.430 --> 25:34.610]  Oh, did Eric not mute his audio
[25:34.610 --> 25:35.510]  when he left his chair?
[25:35.670 --> 25:37.230]  I don't know.
[25:49.080 --> 25:51.200]  So this game came out
[25:51.200 --> 25:52.140]  today?
[25:53.340 --> 25:53.940]  Yesterday.
[25:55.020 --> 25:56.040]  Title screen!
[25:56.620 --> 25:57.300]  Bonanza!
[26:00.500 --> 26:02.240]  I think it's not cool gaming.
[26:04.020 --> 26:05.060]  Onion rings make
[26:05.060 --> 26:06.400]  more sense if you're playing Sonic.
[26:06.600 --> 26:07.820]  That's an excellent point.
[26:07.820 --> 26:09.340]  I was thinking about that.
[26:10.080 --> 26:11.480]  Oh shit!
[26:11.680 --> 26:12.140]  Garfield's phone!
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.800]  We should get a landline.
[26:16.180 --> 26:16.400]  Oh!
[26:17.380 --> 26:18.980]  Yeah, no, that's for the thing.
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:23.120 --> 26:25.820]  Man, I feel like we have so many...
[26:26.600 --> 26:27.760]  It's like I was listening to
[26:27.760 --> 26:29.860]  Stern the other day, Eric, and
[26:31.200 --> 26:31.800]  Blit was
[26:31.800 --> 26:33.240]  talking about how he's running like
[26:33.680 --> 26:35.360]  11 grafts on
[26:35.360 --> 26:36.940]  JD at once.
[26:37.980 --> 26:38.860]  Lagoon lair!
[26:39.060 --> 26:40.900]  He's like in various stages.
[26:42.060 --> 26:43.440]  And I feel like we have
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.680]  that going on. We're like in every direction
[26:45.680 --> 26:46.760]  of this building, you've got
[26:47.320 --> 26:49.160]  half-cocked, half-finished ideas.
[26:51.060 --> 26:53.640]  Oh! We got like banana tails.
[26:56.300 --> 26:57.020]  Ape Cape!
[26:57.320 --> 26:58.560]  Looks cool as shit!
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.360]  Oh, this looks so good! What planet are we on?
[27:02.200 --> 27:02.740]  Ape Cape!
[27:03.640 --> 27:04.440]  Well now,
[27:04.820 --> 27:06.820]  an Ape Cape sounds like a...
[27:06.820 --> 27:09.060]  a cape. Sounds like an area
[27:09.060 --> 27:09.940]  near water.
[27:10.480 --> 27:12.540]  Maybe the whole world is a cape.
[27:14.360 --> 27:15.080]  Yeah, everything's
[27:15.080 --> 27:15.380]  Ape Cape.
[27:16.400 --> 27:18.140]  Oh, I need more for that.
[27:18.380 --> 27:19.200]  Get more health.
[27:22.240 --> 27:23.240]  What's the bubble do?
[27:26.220 --> 27:26.780]  Okay!
[27:27.940 --> 27:28.500]  Whoa!
[27:29.240 --> 27:29.940]  Did I do that?
[27:30.300 --> 27:31.940]  See if you can get in the bubble and do a
[27:31.940 --> 27:32.380]  Kurt Russell.
[27:33.740 --> 27:34.460]  Oh, man.
[27:37.640 --> 27:39.320]  See if it comes back. I don't think it will.
[27:39.580 --> 27:40.420]  I'll have to find a new bubble.
[27:41.580 --> 27:43.640]  Oh, it's so beautiful.
[27:43.800 --> 27:44.780]  It's luscious. What's this?
[27:44.960 --> 27:47.700]  Take a look at the Acura MDX if you want a nice
[27:47.700 --> 27:49.900]  third row SUV. It's MILF
[27:49.900 --> 27:50.500]  approved.
[27:52.880 --> 27:53.640]  It's MILF approved.
[27:56.120 --> 27:57.800]  That sounds really suggestive.
[28:01.160 --> 28:02.020]  I mean, it's on
[28:02.020 --> 28:03.080]  the box. I don't know.
[28:03.900 --> 28:05.420]  It's their choice.
[28:06.080 --> 28:07.800]  Okay, I gotta pick stuff up, I guess.
[28:09.160 --> 28:09.980]  Oh, he had
[28:09.980 --> 28:11.960]  a rock to block it. Nick loved how
[28:11.960 --> 28:12.360]  that sounded.
[28:17.580 --> 28:19.660]  Oh, shit! I went down.
[28:19.940 --> 28:20.960]  Hold the grab button.
[28:23.320 --> 28:23.960]  Hold it.
[28:25.020 --> 28:25.320]  Okay.
[28:27.460 --> 28:28.060]  I see.
[28:28.060 --> 28:28.880]  Okay, I can throw.
[28:31.520 --> 28:32.240]  Oh, that's...
[28:33.580 --> 28:33.940]  Nope!
[28:37.240 --> 28:38.060]  Do I have
[28:38.060 --> 28:39.940]  the skill to do this or am I just not hitting
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.320]  the button? Oh, you're not hitting the button.
[28:42.020 --> 28:43.720]  Okay, so let's...
[28:44.120 --> 28:44.920]  Release, maybe?
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.080]  Do you personally have the skill to do this? I don't
[28:48.080 --> 28:49.460]  know. Oh, I just did it.
[28:49.640 --> 28:50.260]  Which I do.
[28:51.940 --> 28:52.800]  Just did it.
[28:54.760 --> 28:55.120]  Fossil!
[28:55.120 --> 28:56.860]  Oh my god!
[28:57.260 --> 28:57.520]  It's a cosmetic thing.
[28:59.260 --> 29:00.320]  The lore.
[29:05.860 --> 29:06.920]  More fossils!
[29:07.860 --> 29:08.680]  Oh, that's nice.
[29:09.880 --> 29:11.160]  Can you put them in a museum, like
[29:11.160 --> 29:11.480]  Glathers?
[29:12.680 --> 29:13.280]  Oh, maybe.
[29:15.920 --> 29:16.960]  Need to raid
[29:16.960 --> 29:18.380]  a museum in Animal Crossing.
[29:19.280 --> 29:20.160]  Buy all the outfits.
[29:21.800 --> 29:22.500]  Oh, fish?
[29:23.420 --> 29:24.480]  Oh wait, I can Kurt Russell.
[29:24.780 --> 29:25.060]  Oh, Kurt Russell.
[29:28.480 --> 29:30.200]  You're too strong. You're stronger than Kurt Russell.
[29:33.380 --> 29:34.560]  Oh, that's me hollering.
[29:46.260 --> 29:46.620]  Okay.
[29:47.960 --> 29:49.220]  I was just trying to buy an outfit.
[29:49.360 --> 29:51.740]  Oh, somebody said that there's a peak mod
[29:51.740 --> 29:53.580]  to play with more players, so we can do five.
[29:54.700 --> 29:55.360]  Yeah, there sure is.
[29:55.720 --> 29:57.140]  That's awesome. In what game?
[29:57.780 --> 29:59.060]  Peak. Oh, really?
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.260]  Or we could do four
[30:01.260 --> 30:02.420]  and I could commentate.
[30:02.980 --> 30:03.960]  That sounds like shit.
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.040]  We gotta get you in there.
[30:07.040 --> 30:08.940]  We gotta get you in there climbing with us, buddy.
[30:09.080 --> 30:10.420]  I don't think we want me in there.
[30:11.580 --> 30:13.320]  My least favorite kind of game.
[30:13.880 --> 30:15.380]  I just don't want to bring...
[30:15.380 --> 30:16.380]  See, I'm a real...
[30:16.380 --> 30:18.660]  I can lower a floor, you know?
[30:19.820 --> 30:21.180]  I'm a real floor lower.
[30:21.560 --> 30:22.840]  I just don't want to do that to y'all.
[30:22.860 --> 30:24.480]  I think you gotta be shooting for the sky, baby.
[30:24.980 --> 30:25.200]  Yeah.
[30:27.220 --> 30:27.660]  Ah.
[30:28.460 --> 30:29.400]  Okay, this is where
[30:29.400 --> 30:31.160]  they explain that mechanic that I didn't know.
[30:34.340 --> 30:35.800]  You better learn it or Gavin will make fun of you.
[30:40.360 --> 30:40.800]  Whoa!
[30:41.540 --> 30:43.420]  Oh, a map?
[30:43.600 --> 30:44.300]  Banana scroll.
[30:45.140 --> 30:45.540]  That's cool.
[30:53.510 --> 30:55.710]  Yeah, fuck you.
[30:56.990 --> 30:57.830]  It's so cool
[30:57.830 --> 30:59.270]  how destructible this world is.
[30:59.270 --> 31:00.650]  Dude, the whole thing is.
[31:00.810 --> 31:02.190]  Just dig to the ground.
[31:02.410 --> 31:03.770]  Just keep going down and see what happens.
[31:07.210 --> 31:08.770]  It's like that Mars game.
[31:09.330 --> 31:10.210]  The destructible environment.
[31:10.470 --> 31:10.690]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:14.230 --> 31:15.010]  That's awesome.
[31:17.310 --> 31:17.750]  Dude.
[31:17.910 --> 31:19.550]  I just dropped in.
[31:20.450 --> 31:21.030]  You're in the underneath.
[31:23.950 --> 31:25.310]  Why are you pressing
[31:25.310 --> 31:26.150]  the punch up button?
[31:26.150 --> 31:27.350]  It's so confusing.
[31:28.810 --> 31:29.170]  Because...
[31:29.170 --> 31:30.470]  You gotta punch up to dill down.
[31:32.050 --> 31:34.110]  Because X in most games that I'm used to
[31:34.110 --> 31:35.350]  playing is the like
[31:36.170 --> 31:36.890]  standard slash.
[31:37.530 --> 31:39.090]  So I'm hitting X instinctually.
[31:43.730 --> 31:45.030]  Oh, it's starting to smell like onion rings
[31:45.030 --> 31:45.410]  in here, Geoff.
[31:46.090 --> 31:47.270]  Oh my god, it is.
[31:47.350 --> 31:47.850]  That's the goal.
[31:48.910 --> 31:51.010]  I'm so excited to see how it fries them up.
[31:52.250 --> 31:54.170]  I mean, you're not gonna see, but we can let you know.
[31:54.530 --> 31:56.110]  Yeah, we'll take pictures.
[31:56.110 --> 31:57.510]  I wonder how they'll compare.
[31:57.530 --> 31:58.670]  We might take pictures.
[31:59.970 --> 32:02.270]  I wonder how they'll compare to another onion ring
[32:02.270 --> 32:04.250]  I'm thinking of.
[32:08.110 --> 32:09.990]  I just ate one frozen.
[32:10.490 --> 32:11.570]  It's way better than that.
[32:12.110 --> 32:14.190]  It looks like you're throwing wads
[32:14.190 --> 32:15.770]  of uncooked meat at it.
[32:19.350 --> 32:20.710]  That was good.
[32:23.230 --> 32:24.550]  Forget about it.
[32:25.430 --> 32:26.110]  Holy shit.
[32:26.150 --> 32:27.450]  Does this just keep sticking to him?
[32:29.050 --> 32:30.590]  It's like that goo on FBC
[32:31.970 --> 32:32.330]  Firebreak.
[32:36.070 --> 32:36.770]  Smash him!
[32:39.130 --> 32:40.570]  I wonder if there was something around
[32:40.570 --> 32:42.050]  here that you could use to smash him with.
[32:43.010 --> 32:43.710]  Probably not.
[32:44.210 --> 32:45.070]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[32:46.010 --> 32:48.210]  And I'm definitely not gonna look for it, or try to find it,
[32:48.310 --> 32:49.890]  or just use the things right there.
[32:51.150 --> 32:51.510]  Okay.
[32:51.510 --> 32:51.710]  Okay.
[32:55.130 --> 32:56.270]  That's your fault, Eric.
[32:56.330 --> 32:58.550]  I'm just playing a game for the first time.
[32:58.750 --> 33:01.150]  I'm just running around. I'm just having fun.
[33:01.330 --> 33:02.330]  You are. It's true.
[33:04.350 --> 33:05.030]  Punching up.
[33:05.610 --> 33:06.750]  That's what DK does.
[33:07.070 --> 33:08.930]  Hey, there's a fossil.
[33:09.810 --> 33:10.010]  Right there.
[33:10.470 --> 33:13.170]  I wish there was a way, something that was around here
[33:13.170 --> 33:15.390]  that would help me figure out how to break what that is.
[33:15.670 --> 33:17.030]  You were almost there.
[33:17.370 --> 33:18.370]  But you just missed it.
[33:21.530 --> 33:22.590]  Oh, what's that?
[33:24.510 --> 33:24.910]  Whoa!
[33:25.410 --> 33:26.510]  That's some good chunking.
[33:27.970 --> 33:28.370]  Interesting.
[33:29.730 --> 33:30.130]  Interesting.
[33:30.510 --> 33:33.470]  Oh, now he's just a weird dude.
[33:33.530 --> 33:34.410]  Now he's just a little peach.
[33:37.830 --> 33:38.230]  Aw.
[33:41.070 --> 33:42.410]  Is that Majora's Mask?
[33:43.270 --> 33:43.430]  Yeah.
[33:45.110 --> 33:46.810]  I wish I knew Ninja Dead better.
[33:47.830 --> 33:49.650]  Well, that was easy. I don't know why people are always like,
[33:49.650 --> 33:51.030]  oh, we're running out of water, or whatever.
[33:51.150 --> 33:53.070]  You just gotta punch the thing.
[33:53.710 --> 33:55.290]  Before you jump down there, you should...
[33:55.910 --> 33:57.670]  Sorry, I was in the motion.
[33:57.990 --> 33:59.190]  Yep. Yeah, you were in the motion.
[34:01.530 --> 34:02.110]  Sublayer 101.
[34:04.330 --> 34:06.310]  Can I use this barrel to shoot back up?
[34:06.690 --> 34:07.330]  I think so.
[34:09.130 --> 34:09.530]  Banana.
[34:14.870 --> 34:15.250]  Okay.
[34:18.790 --> 34:19.590]  To Birdboy3,
[34:19.590 --> 34:21.810]  we've recorded two Firebreak videos.
[34:22.210 --> 34:23.650]  I think we'll probably do one more.
[34:25.010 --> 34:27.230]  You should sort of explore this upper
[34:27.230 --> 34:28.450]  land a little bit.
[34:28.750 --> 34:31.610]  There's like 60 fossils,
[34:31.870 --> 34:32.530]  I think, to collect.
[34:32.550 --> 34:33.910]  And a bunch of bananas.
[34:34.510 --> 34:37.150]  There's just so, so much.
[34:38.030 --> 34:38.190]  Okay.
[34:39.350 --> 34:41.430]  And I think the exploring, now that there's some
[34:41.430 --> 34:43.350]  mechanics involved that you sort of understand,
[34:44.830 --> 34:46.010]  you should definitely
[34:46.010 --> 34:47.530]  be exploring and stuff.
[34:49.750 --> 34:50.350]  Let's check.
[34:53.650 --> 34:54.770]  Whoa, that's so cool.
[34:55.830 --> 34:57.470]  You see those ruts you're digging
[34:57.470 --> 34:59.530]  into the ground there? I could fix that up so
[34:59.530 --> 35:00.590]  fast in Roadcraft.
[35:04.330 --> 35:04.770]  Whoa!
[35:06.150 --> 35:06.930]  Hit me to the fossil.
[35:07.890 --> 35:09.550]  I wanna play Tears of the Kingdom again.
[35:11.870 --> 35:13.750]  When will we see more Sea of Thieves?
[35:13.970 --> 35:14.850]  How about next Thursday?
[35:15.470 --> 35:17.790]  Next week? Man, I was playing
[35:17.790 --> 35:19.750]  with the truck boys last night, we were playing
[35:19.750 --> 35:21.910]  Wet Trucks, and we got deep
[35:21.910 --> 35:24.310]  into fishing. Fishing's great in that game. Oh, is that right?
[35:24.310 --> 35:25.650]  Yeah, really good.
[35:25.990 --> 35:27.370]  Oh, awesome. I didn't
[35:27.990 --> 35:29.370]  understand what I was missing.
[35:30.230 --> 35:31.730]  Yeah, it's fun. There's so many
[35:31.730 --> 35:33.430]  fish to collect as well. Yeah.
[35:33.630 --> 35:35.770]  We're trying to get our hunters rep
[35:35.770 --> 35:37.770]  up to 15 so we can get the banner
[35:37.770 --> 35:38.510]  or whatever, you know?
[35:40.090 --> 35:41.750]  I feel like, as
[35:41.750 --> 35:43.930]  fun as the first video that we put out this week
[35:43.930 --> 35:45.210]  was, the second one is
[35:45.710 --> 35:47.190]  like, what an adventure by
[35:47.190 --> 35:47.690]  comparison.
[35:50.190 --> 35:51.230]  Yeah, things
[35:52.450 --> 35:53.310]  go away
[35:53.310 --> 35:54.290]  in that second video.
[35:56.090 --> 35:57.010]  It definitely escalated.
[35:59.270 --> 36:00.570]  Ooh, a little secret banana.
[36:02.290 --> 36:03.170]  Oh, banana.
[36:07.430 --> 36:08.990]  Can I ask what your opinion
[36:08.990 --> 36:10.250]  on Twin Peaks The Return was?
[36:10.430 --> 36:13.070]  I talked about it in Saw, right? I haven't seen it
[36:13.070 --> 36:14.910]  all the way through. Andrew, if you hit
[36:15.630 --> 36:16.130]  select,
[36:17.670 --> 36:19.150]  it'll show you the map.
[36:19.750 --> 36:21.230]  And this is sort of an indication
[36:21.230 --> 36:23.050]  of how big everything is
[36:23.050 --> 36:25.050]  here. This is just the level that you
[36:25.050 --> 36:26.030]  are at so far.
[36:26.270 --> 36:28.690]  It's not counting where you shot down to,
[36:28.950 --> 36:30.110]  which is like a different map.
[36:31.250 --> 36:32.690]  But all of this stuff
[36:33.490 --> 36:35.210]  is... there's bananas and fossils
[36:35.210 --> 36:36.910]  everywhere. The more you dig into
[36:36.910 --> 36:38.950]  these mountains, you'll find these treasure chests
[36:38.950 --> 36:40.330]  that have
[36:41.610 --> 36:42.550]  treasure maps.
[36:42.550 --> 36:44.890]  Yes, found one of those.
[36:45.130 --> 36:46.530]  Yeah, they'll give you...
[36:46.530 --> 36:48.390]  and then you go to your map and it'll show you like,
[36:48.490 --> 36:50.270]  oh, there's a banana here, or whatever.
[36:51.130 --> 36:52.610]  Okay. So the more
[36:52.610 --> 36:54.610]  you dig into these mountains and just break
[36:54.610 --> 36:56.630]  stuff, that is what this game desperately
[36:56.630 --> 36:58.590]  wants you to do. Just destroy
[36:58.590 --> 37:00.530]  everything. Oh, and you can stand there and sing to it.
[37:00.930 --> 37:02.530]  The map is like three
[37:02.530 --> 37:04.110]  leveled, then, it looked like?
[37:04.690 --> 37:06.170]  This one is, yes.
[37:06.750 --> 37:07.790]  Okay, so they vary.
[37:08.310 --> 37:10.750]  Get the fuck out of here, little statues!
[37:10.750 --> 37:12.490]  Bah! Oh. Bah!
[37:12.690 --> 37:13.170]  There we go.
[37:17.050 --> 37:17.650]  What's this?
[37:19.410 --> 37:20.630]  It's like a challenge level
[37:20.630 --> 37:21.390]  in Mario Sunshine?
[37:23.370 --> 37:24.450]  Uh, yes. Yeah.
[37:25.690 --> 37:25.830]  Okay.
[37:26.690 --> 37:28.750]  It's not timed or anything, it's just like
[37:29.250 --> 37:30.590]  can you do it? Let's do the thing.
[37:30.890 --> 37:31.970]  Yeah. Okay.
[37:33.030 --> 37:34.610]  I wouldn't say this is like, hard-hard,
[37:34.810 --> 37:36.750]  but it is, um...
[37:37.750 --> 37:38.930]  this early, it's not
[37:43.510 --> 37:43.910]  hard.
[37:43.910 --> 37:45.090]  Is this still level one,
[37:45.410 --> 37:46.610]  Eric? Well, oh yeah.
[37:47.170 --> 37:47.390]  Yeah.
[37:48.810 --> 37:50.750]  So is each level essentially a world?
[37:51.530 --> 37:52.750]  I don't know, I've only been in two.
[37:54.270 --> 37:54.670]  Whoa.
[37:55.930 --> 37:56.950]  I guess you only have
[37:56.950 --> 37:58.930]  had it for a day. Yeah, but, man,
[37:58.990 --> 38:01.290]  I've put like some time into it, and it's pretty...
[38:01.290 --> 38:01.850]  there's a lot.
[38:04.790 --> 38:05.210]  Shit.
[38:06.590 --> 38:07.010]  Nice.
[38:07.730 --> 38:09.430]  Nick gasping there, it's crazy.
[38:16.990 --> 38:17.830]  Skill point.
[38:20.190 --> 38:21.990]  And you don't have to increase my punch power,
[38:22.010 --> 38:23.910]  so yeah, yeah, I'm gonna let it build.
[38:24.470 --> 38:25.690]  Ooh. You wanna get the red balloon?
[38:27.110 --> 38:27.270]  Okay.
[38:27.270 --> 38:31.430]  I don't know why you wouldn't want to get the red balloon.
[38:31.490 --> 38:32.090]  You wanna...
[38:33.790 --> 38:34.750]  This is the way you came from.
[38:35.990 --> 38:36.890]  Yeah, I just want these.
[38:37.090 --> 38:38.430]  Oh, I see, I see, I see.
[38:43.480 --> 38:44.400]  Sounds like your onion rings
[38:44.400 --> 38:45.760]  might be done, Geoff. Ooh.
[38:46.300 --> 38:48.000]  Ooh. Oh, is that,
[38:48.100 --> 38:49.980]  does that air fryer make you flip things halfway through,
[38:50.080 --> 38:51.280]  or can you just let them go, do you know?
[38:51.580 --> 38:53.540]  I mean, I shook them around a little bit,
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.660]  but you can punch through this stuff.
[38:56.840 --> 38:57.160]  Shit.
[38:58.380 --> 38:58.740]  Right?
[39:02.380 --> 39:02.740]  Other...
[39:02.740 --> 39:03.300]  It's to the right.
[39:04.940 --> 39:06.980]  Oh, no, I'm sorry, I was talking to Geoff.
[39:07.300 --> 39:07.380]  Okay.
[39:08.520 --> 39:10.040]  Yeah, you can punch through this stuff,
[39:10.440 --> 39:11.740]  if you need to get through.
[39:15.140 --> 39:16.440]  What's up, mana symbol, how you doing?
[39:17.820 --> 39:18.180]  Banana.
[39:18.560 --> 39:20.340]  Does it make you flip things?
[39:21.020 --> 39:21.680]  Does it, yeah.
[39:21.840 --> 39:24.300]  It starts, like, scolding you and stuff.
[39:24.300 --> 39:26.060]  What do you think you're doing?
[39:26.160 --> 39:26.520]  Flip it, idiot!
[39:28.540 --> 39:30.420]  I don't think there's anything else I'm really missing.
[39:30.540 --> 39:31.720]  Oh, you fool, that's what you think.
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.160]  We did it. You missed a banana.
[39:36.240 --> 39:37.580]  I missed a banana? Yep.
[39:39.300 --> 39:40.520]  Oh, yeah, because there were three
[39:40.520 --> 39:41.680]  weren't there in the beginning area.
[39:42.020 --> 39:43.160]  There were three, indeed.
[39:44.340 --> 39:45.680]  Yeah, there's three, so I am in second.
[39:50.500 --> 39:51.700]  Punch. Punch.
[39:52.640 --> 39:53.420]  Yes, I got there.
[39:53.420 --> 39:54.280]  Punching up.
[39:54.460 --> 39:56.400]  I'm getting there.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.620]  You should be there already.
[39:59.170 --> 40:00.860]  Well, I'm not.
[40:01.920 --> 40:02.660]  It's the DK way.
[40:05.380 --> 40:07.280]  Oh, Mark the Frog is here.
[40:09.860 --> 40:10.320]  Okay.
[40:11.480 --> 40:11.980]  That's rude.
[40:12.620 --> 40:13.860]  Geoff, Mark the Frog's in the chat.
[40:15.160 --> 40:16.040]  Mark the Frog.
[40:16.800 --> 40:18.160]  Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.
[40:20.620 --> 40:22.300]  Yeah, fuck you guys.
[40:23.140 --> 40:24.120]  A lot easier when you just
[40:24.120 --> 40:25.100]  kind of like punch through it, huh?
[40:26.200 --> 40:26.640]  Yeah.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.860]  The Donkey Kong way, baby.
[40:31.620 --> 40:32.000]  Mmm.
[40:33.760 --> 40:34.920]  That's a pretty good un-ring.
[40:38.420 --> 40:39.300]  Balloon again.
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.240]  So, this time...
[40:46.240 --> 40:48.060]  I can tell you where it's at. It's up to you.
[40:48.220 --> 40:48.580]  Yeah, go ahead.
[40:49.780 --> 40:51.460]  So, you see how they're all coming from your left?
[40:52.160 --> 40:54.320]  If you go to like the right-most part
[40:54.320 --> 40:55.700]  of those and break your way through,
[40:56.040 --> 40:58.080]  there is a...
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.240]  There's like a little alcove
[41:00.240 --> 41:01.740]  you can get to. So, no, no, go.
[41:01.980 --> 41:03.960]  Turn around. There you go.
[41:04.180 --> 41:06.240]  And then start breaking through these to your left.
[41:06.320 --> 41:07.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then keep going left.
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.180]  Yeah, there you go. Keep going, keep going,
[41:10.220 --> 41:11.940]  keep going, keep punching, keep breaking, keep breaking,
[41:11.980 --> 41:13.600]  and punching. Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[41:14.320 --> 41:16.560]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[41:16.640 --> 41:17.240]  There you go.
[41:17.820 --> 41:20.800]  Oh, no, no, no.
[41:21.000 --> 41:21.880]  Yeah, press a button.
[41:22.300 --> 41:22.640]  Fuck!
[41:23.740 --> 41:25.240]  There's just a little alcove.
[41:26.820 --> 41:27.220]  Like...
[41:27.660 --> 41:29.300]  It's hard to see from here, but yeah.
[41:34.050 --> 41:34.670]  There you go.
[41:34.910 --> 41:35.150]  Ah!
[41:36.990 --> 41:37.390]  Fuck!
[41:45.030 --> 41:47.170]  If you cross all the way, it might be easier to see
[41:47.170 --> 41:48.710]  where you need to go, but it's up to you.
[41:48.710 --> 41:49.050]  Okay.
[41:51.590 --> 41:52.830]  So I'm trying to get over there.
[41:53.070 --> 41:53.670]  Yeah, you see that over there?
[41:54.350 --> 41:56.090]  And how do I...
[41:56.660 --> 41:58.450]  Oh, I see. Okay.
[41:59.390 --> 41:59.950]  Got it.
[42:02.330 --> 42:03.230]  I got it.
[42:04.210 --> 42:05.290]  You just gotta keep going.
[42:07.430 --> 42:08.570]  It's a lot easier when you have
[42:08.570 --> 42:09.810]  the stronger punching power.
[42:10.410 --> 42:11.230]  Oh, of course, yeah.
[42:12.090 --> 42:13.630]  I wanna build that up.
[42:13.830 --> 42:14.810]  You're doing amazing, sweetie.
[42:14.810 --> 42:15.930]  There you go.
[42:20.430 --> 42:20.850]  Yeah!
[42:21.810 --> 42:24.290]  Oh, secret banana.
[42:25.170 --> 42:25.690]  Banana.
[42:27.010 --> 42:29.150]  I wanna upgrade my punching power so bad.
[42:30.030 --> 42:30.450]  Five.
[42:31.650 --> 42:33.010]  Yeah, five bananas
[42:33.010 --> 42:33.530]  to level up.
[42:39.150 --> 42:40.710]  Dude, good onion rings.
[42:42.550 --> 42:43.390]  Ball.
[42:46.910 --> 42:48.190]  To space!
[42:48.890 --> 42:50.290]  I'm gonna go see what I have
[42:50.290 --> 42:50.950]  in my freezer.
[43:01.840 --> 43:03.740]  You hiding anything back here?
[43:04.720 --> 43:05.620]  What you hiding?
[43:08.380 --> 43:09.560]  There's something in here.
[43:09.720 --> 43:12.940]  If you do like that ground punch thing,
[43:13.300 --> 43:15.060]  it kinda uses like a sonar
[43:15.060 --> 43:16.800]  so you can see stuff that's like hidden
[43:16.800 --> 43:17.420]  within stuff.
[43:18.000 --> 43:18.620]  I'm sorry.
[43:18.800 --> 43:21.460]  Sometimes you'll see stuff that's like...
[43:21.940 --> 43:22.200]  Got it.
[43:22.480 --> 43:24.500]  Oh, there's like a banana in here.
[43:25.460 --> 43:25.900]  Whoa.
[43:30.520 --> 43:31.560]  This is so cool.
[43:33.340 --> 43:34.300]  It's crazy, right?
[43:35.100 --> 43:36.340]  Do I need to interact with these?
[43:36.540 --> 43:37.600]  No, you don't have to.
[43:38.360 --> 43:40.900]  Eric, on average,
[43:41.160 --> 43:43.700]  how many hours a day would you say you play video games?
[43:45.360 --> 43:46.760]  Depends if there's a new one.
[43:46.760 --> 43:47.960]  Like right now,
[43:50.600 --> 43:51.720]  I'll stay up
[43:52.500 --> 43:54.120]  and I'll play, you know,
[43:54.180 --> 43:55.540]  three hours or something.
[43:55.680 --> 43:57.880]  But on an average day or whatever,
[43:58.100 --> 43:59.560]  less than an hour probably.
[44:00.200 --> 44:02.560]  Unless there's something
[44:02.560 --> 44:03.700]  I feel invested in.
[44:04.880 --> 44:06.820]  I really like this in my rotation
[44:06.820 --> 44:08.060]  of meditative games.
[44:08.260 --> 44:10.280]  I'll spend three hours
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.880]  building a road in Roadcraft
[44:11.880 --> 44:14.420]  and then go into this and break everything for three hours.
[44:15.120 --> 44:16.420]  It's a really good
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.580]  counterbalance in life.
[44:22.000 --> 44:23.060]  It's just satisfying.
[44:24.080 --> 44:25.780]  All of this just feels good.
[44:26.000 --> 44:27.260]  I like games where
[44:27.800 --> 44:29.820]  I'm incentivized for going back and playing.
[44:29.900 --> 44:31.360]  I was playing a lot of Marvel Rivals
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.780]  because it was like, oh, I do my chores and I can get
[44:33.780 --> 44:35.220]  new Raccoon skins or whatever.
[44:35.600 --> 44:35.980]  You know what I mean?
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.640]  But by and large, I'm not really
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.840]  playing a lot of games
[44:41.840 --> 44:42.280]  very much.
[44:48.550 --> 44:49.190]  It's
[44:49.190 --> 44:51.050]  5pm in Halifax?
[44:51.210 --> 44:52.890]  Is Halifax two hours ahead?
[44:53.330 --> 44:54.430]  Congratulations, Halifax.
[44:54.670 --> 44:55.830]  How is that possible?
[44:56.290 --> 44:58.590]  Is that how far east Halifax is?
[44:59.090 --> 44:59.890]  Pretty east.
[45:00.170 --> 45:01.850]  What time zone is Halifax in?
[45:06.180 --> 45:07.180]  What's one
[45:07.180 --> 45:08.820]  to the right of eastern time?
[45:09.160 --> 45:10.960]  I don't know! Halifax time.
[45:12.500 --> 45:13.200]  Oh yeah.
[45:13.540 --> 45:13.840]  Oh, Goofral.
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.760]  Atlantic time?
[45:17.760 --> 45:18.660]  GWT?
[45:20.420 --> 45:21.880]  Are you guys aware of Atlantic time?
[45:22.220 --> 45:23.780]  Is Iceland in Atlantic
[45:23.780 --> 45:24.480]  standard time?
[45:28.500 --> 45:28.820]  Huh.
[45:29.980 --> 45:31.080]  That's pretty good.
[45:34.040 --> 45:34.640]  Whoa!
[45:43.940 --> 45:45.940]  Bum bum bum.
[45:46.400 --> 45:48.060]  Iceland is the same time zone as the UK.
[45:48.200 --> 45:48.740]  That makes sense.
[45:51.910 --> 45:53.130]  Although it's not in the UK.
[45:53.170 --> 45:55.750]  So I assume those banana coin things were for
[45:55.750 --> 45:58.010]  cosmetic items, but that's what the fossils
[45:58.010 --> 45:58.590]  are for.
[46:00.590 --> 46:02.050]  Like the hexagon
[46:02.050 --> 46:02.930]  coins or whatever?
[46:03.410 --> 46:04.970]  It's other stuff that you can buy.
[46:05.730 --> 46:05.910]  Okay.
[46:07.390 --> 46:10.010]  I've only just now found a spot where I can spend
[46:10.010 --> 46:11.450]  the gold and the hex coins.
[46:11.630 --> 46:13.930]  They're like banana chips or chip coins
[46:13.930 --> 46:14.670]  or something like that.
[46:16.070 --> 46:17.890]  It's just buying other stuff.
[46:18.310 --> 46:20.010]  Again, I think it's mainly cosmetic
[46:20.010 --> 46:21.590]  or like items.
[46:23.750 --> 46:24.990]  Oh, you know what it was?
[46:25.150 --> 46:26.610]  It was to get bonus bananas.
[46:26.770 --> 46:28.930]  It's like, oh, for five of these,
[46:29.050 --> 46:29.790]  I'll give you a banana.
[46:30.110 --> 46:31.430]  I think is what it was.
[46:32.370 --> 46:32.730]  I see.
[46:33.570 --> 46:34.390]  That makes sense.
[46:35.750 --> 46:37.410]  A lot of banana slices.
[46:38.710 --> 46:40.590]  Like there's three different kinds of fossils
[46:40.590 --> 46:40.990]  also.
[46:49.980 --> 46:51.280]  You don't need to worry about that.
[46:51.280 --> 46:52.420]  Yeah, I'll shoot up, I assume.
[46:53.700 --> 46:55.880]  There are like a few different ways to get back
[46:55.880 --> 46:58.200]  to this level from the level below.
[46:59.500 --> 47:00.380]  There's a lot.
[47:00.440 --> 47:00.880]  It's pretty cool.
[47:02.200 --> 47:02.840]  Oops.
[47:03.680 --> 47:04.580]  Ah, dog, hello.
[47:06.980 --> 47:07.820]  I felt
[47:07.820 --> 47:09.260]  something right on my arm.
[47:10.100 --> 47:11.420]  Nick's kid attacking him.
[47:13.240 --> 47:14.340]  Nick's kid
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.260]  attacking him.
[47:19.780 --> 47:21.440]  During that stream,
[47:21.560 --> 47:23.360]  he was holding things,
[47:23.360 --> 47:25.320]  little projects he put together
[47:25.320 --> 47:27.180]  like two inches from my face.
[47:27.500 --> 47:28.820]  Like, look, look at it.
[47:28.940 --> 47:29.440]  Look at it.
[47:30.700 --> 47:46.640]  Yeah, banana.
[48:00.450 --> 48:01.690]  People are asking
[48:01.690 --> 48:03.170]  if it's Nick's dog with human eyes.
[48:03.610 --> 48:04.010]  Yeah.
[48:05.150 --> 48:07.230]  When will we get the Geoff Carr onions video?
[48:07.370 --> 48:09.590]  Man, I almost went to the onion restaurant
[48:09.590 --> 48:10.090]  yesterday.
[48:10.310 --> 48:12.010]  But I forgot my wallet.
[48:12.890 --> 48:13.490]  Oh, no!
[48:14.710 --> 48:17.330]  As soon as we're all together again, I think we should do it.
[48:17.770 --> 48:18.310]  I'm down.
[48:20.390 --> 48:21.730]  Geoff, we'd have to go to the
[48:21.730 --> 48:23.370]  same location, or are you thinking...
[48:23.370 --> 48:23.810]  Yeah, same location.
[48:24.210 --> 48:26.130]  It has to be the same.
[48:28.370 --> 48:29.990]  Same order, same location,
[48:29.990 --> 48:30.850]  same everything.
[48:31.470 --> 48:32.930]  Are we all getting the same order?
[48:34.510 --> 48:35.990]  Nick wants to know if he can get
[48:35.990 --> 48:37.110]  something different for lunch.
[48:38.150 --> 48:39.790]  We gotta go get hamburgers, man.
[48:39.850 --> 48:40.850]  Let's not overcomplicate it.
[48:42.070 --> 48:43.990]  My question's not...
[48:44.870 --> 48:46.030]  What is your question?
[48:46.490 --> 48:48.230]  My question is, are we each gonna have our own?
[48:49.470 --> 48:50.190]  The fuck?
[48:50.250 --> 48:51.310]  Are we gonna share a hamburger?
[48:51.990 --> 48:54.430]  I thought you were just talking about bringing one for the experiment.
[48:54.430 --> 48:56.050]  Listen, I would like it if we had more
[48:56.050 --> 48:58.010]  Patreon subscribers too, but we're not
[48:58.010 --> 49:00.210]  doing that bad, man. We can all afford our own hamburgers.
[49:09.310 --> 49:12.730]  If you were separating a hamburger
[49:12.730 --> 49:15.290]  Snake Draft style, you have a burger.
[49:15.610 --> 49:16.550]  A standard burger name.
[49:17.490 --> 49:19.050]  What's your first pick? What are you taking?
[49:20.290 --> 49:21.350]  What order do we go in?
[49:21.510 --> 49:22.150]  We should do this.
[49:24.390 --> 49:25.830]  Maybe we should save it.
[49:27.650 --> 49:29.270]  I'm going with the top bun.
[49:29.270 --> 49:31.050]  Oh, good choice, Nick.
[49:33.010 --> 49:35.090]  I feel like I'm going with the cheese.
[49:35.730 --> 49:36.230]  Wow.
[49:39.490 --> 49:40.670]  Tough call.
[49:42.190 --> 49:43.530]  I'll go bottom bun.
[49:47.050 --> 49:48.350]  I'm gonna go beef.
[49:48.830 --> 49:52.230]  Got my first pick.
[49:54.370 --> 49:56.890]  Are we doing a traditional,
[49:56.890 --> 49:58.790]  just basic cheeseburger?
[49:59.590 --> 50:00.650]  Is that what we're doing?
[50:00.790 --> 50:02.690]  To me, I feel like we just got it.
[50:02.850 --> 50:05.030]  What else would be on this burger?
[50:06.810 --> 50:08.570]  I'm going to take lettuce.
[50:09.470 --> 50:11.070]  That's interesting, Andrew, because it's a
[50:11.070 --> 50:13.070]  Snake Draft, so Geoff, you get the
[50:13.070 --> 50:13.550]  second pick.
[50:14.990 --> 50:16.050]  I'm taking lettuce.
[50:20.150 --> 50:23.230]  I'm going to grab the onion while it's still available.
[50:26.890 --> 50:29.430]  Well, then I have to go with the pickle, of course.
[50:29.930 --> 50:31.030]  You're taking the pickle?
[50:31.190 --> 50:32.310]  Thank God. I don't want the pickle.
[50:34.010 --> 50:35.070]  I'm going to go
[50:35.070 --> 50:36.970]  crazy with my swing
[50:36.970 --> 50:38.850]  pick, back to me. I'm going to take
[50:38.850 --> 50:40.250]  the ketchup and the mustard.
[50:40.750 --> 50:41.030]  Wow!
[50:45.430 --> 50:46.470]  There you have it.
[50:46.890 --> 50:48.770]  It was curious.
[50:49.050 --> 50:50.470]  Oh, I see, the snake.
[50:50.630 --> 50:51.430]  I got you.
[50:51.870 --> 50:52.750]  Nick is new to this.
[50:52.750 --> 50:54.110]  No, no, no, no.
[50:56.770 --> 50:58.990]  Nick's not new to this. Nick's not paying attention.
[50:59.030 --> 51:00.610]  Nope, just wasn't thinking.
[51:00.850 --> 51:02.890]  Alright, for my next pick, I'm going to go with
[51:02.890 --> 51:04.410]  the... let's see.
[51:09.170 --> 51:11.050]  I'm going to go with the mayonnaise.
[51:12.250 --> 51:13.770]  There can't be mayonnaise on it.
[51:13.910 --> 51:15.410]  Yeah, I don't know what else would be on it, though.
[51:16.050 --> 51:17.770]  Did someone take the bottom bun?
[51:18.210 --> 51:18.950]  Yeah, Eric did.
[51:19.570 --> 51:21.550]  Can I take the sesame seeds?
[51:23.210 --> 51:23.910]  Or is that
[51:23.910 --> 51:24.810]  part of the top bun?
[51:25.170 --> 51:26.930]  I think that's part of the top bun.
[51:27.070 --> 51:28.210]  Can we leave it to a vote?
[51:28.590 --> 51:30.630]  There's three of you, so you can vote.
[51:31.690 --> 51:33.690]  I mean, I would have to take the poppy seeds
[51:33.690 --> 51:34.790]  off of my bun.
[51:35.050 --> 51:37.550]  I'm going to say no, because
[51:37.550 --> 51:39.750]  I wouldn't let you take the tomato seeds out of the tomato
[51:39.750 --> 51:41.030]  either. Oh, that's true.
[51:41.450 --> 51:41.930]  That's true.
[51:43.690 --> 51:45.510]  Okay, then what else can I get?
[51:45.590 --> 51:46.470]  What do I feel like?
[51:47.790 --> 51:48.070]  Oh!
[51:48.970 --> 51:49.950]  I'm going to draft
[51:49.950 --> 51:50.610]  the grease.
[51:51.830 --> 51:52.430]  Okay.
[51:53.050 --> 51:56.050]  The final pick of our cheeseburger draft.
[51:56.510 --> 51:57.530]  Geoff, what do you want?
[51:57.790 --> 51:59.310]  Did anybody pick tomato yet?
[51:59.790 --> 52:00.090]  No.
[52:01.270 --> 52:03.790]  I'm pretty sure Andrew...
[52:03.790 --> 52:04.890]  Wait, did anyone pick tomato?
[52:05.070 --> 52:06.870]  Did we miss the tomato?
[52:07.710 --> 52:08.830]  I'm taking tomato.
[52:09.090 --> 52:11.790]  Ketchup and mustard threw me so much that
[52:11.790 --> 52:13.790]  we totally missed tomato.
[52:14.230 --> 52:16.390]  You're right. Great final pick, Geoff.
[52:16.810 --> 52:17.630]  Thank you, thank you.
[52:17.830 --> 52:20.270]  I feel pretty good about beef, lettuce, tomato.
[52:21.010 --> 52:21.930]  I can make it a wrap.
[52:21.970 --> 52:23.290]  You really made out well.
[52:24.030 --> 52:24.890]  You got a BLT, buddy.
[52:25.510 --> 52:28.070]  I got a top bun and ketchup and mustard.
[52:30.630 --> 52:32.610]  Oh, I got cheese, pickle,
[52:32.710 --> 52:33.090]  and mayo.
[52:35.010 --> 52:36.630]  That's not a bad way to go.
[52:38.610 --> 52:40.070]  I was going to say, in college,
[52:40.330 --> 52:42.270]  when I didn't have money, I used to eat
[52:43.150 --> 52:44.430]  American cheese, jalapeno,
[52:44.430 --> 52:45.490]  and mayonnaise sandwiches.
[52:48.690 --> 52:50.850]  And this is the house that you lived in
[52:50.850 --> 52:52.130]  where you gave the guy money
[52:52.130 --> 52:53.370]  so he could abandon his family?
[52:53.790 --> 52:54.810]  That was before that.
[52:56.170 --> 52:58.010]  I didn't have enough money to give him yet.
[52:58.490 --> 52:58.870]  Oh, okay.
[53:00.430 --> 53:02.350]  So this is the house where the cat would
[53:02.350 --> 53:04.130]  crawl in between the two floors of the home?
[53:04.150 --> 53:05.190]  No, that's the same place.
[53:06.590 --> 53:07.610]  This place was a dorm.
[53:08.110 --> 53:09.690]  So it was before I moved into the apartment
[53:09.690 --> 53:12.190]  where I helped the guy incidentally abandon his family.
[53:12.190 --> 53:14.090]  And then, also, the cat got in.
[53:16.990 --> 53:18.050]  And then, also,
[53:18.330 --> 53:20.130]  my roommate had his
[53:20.130 --> 53:22.070]  girlfriend have the baby sleep in a
[53:22.070 --> 53:22.530]  Papazon.
[53:23.810 --> 53:24.370]  What?
[53:24.930 --> 53:25.490]  What?
[53:27.790 --> 53:30.570]  How is there more lore to this place?
[53:32.050 --> 53:34.230]  Well, it was truly a hell hole.
[53:36.350 --> 53:37.950]  We were sophomores
[53:37.950 --> 53:40.190]  and juniors in college
[53:40.190 --> 53:41.570]  over that time frame.
[53:41.750 --> 53:44.010]  And your roommate had a girlfriend
[53:44.010 --> 53:44.690]  with a baby?
[53:45.230 --> 53:46.470]  Yeah, they had a baby.
[53:48.250 --> 53:50.290]  She went to A&M. We were at UT.
[53:50.570 --> 53:51.530]  And she would come to visit.
[53:52.150 --> 53:53.910]  And we didn't have a crib.
[53:54.430 --> 53:55.710]  So we had a Papazon.
[53:56.990 --> 53:58.250]  And the baby
[53:58.250 --> 53:59.610]  slept in the Papazon.
[54:02.900 --> 54:05.460]  I don't know how we've been working together and doing this
[54:05.460 --> 54:07.240]  for so long and then it's just like
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.560]  there's these new pieces of information
[54:09.560 --> 54:11.840]  that are so mind-blowing
[54:11.840 --> 54:12.380]  to me.
[54:12.840 --> 54:15.220]  You just casually go like,
[54:15.300 --> 54:17.620]  Yo, the baby slept in the Papazon.
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.420]  Hashtag not my baby.
[54:23.140 --> 54:25.060]  Not my Papazon either.
[54:25.620 --> 54:27.380]  It was like, did they get it from
[54:27.380 --> 54:29.260]  Pier 1 Imports? The baby?
[54:30.060 --> 54:31.520]  The fucking Papazon,
[54:31.660 --> 54:32.360]  you moron.
[54:35.700 --> 54:36.780]  Yeah, I assume so.
[54:36.780 --> 54:38.640]  The baby.
[54:39.180 --> 54:40.700]  Wow. Oh my god.
[54:41.580 --> 54:42.900]  You could buy anything in the
[54:42.900 --> 54:43.480]  80s.
[54:46.220 --> 54:52.700]  Weird, right? That Papazon
[54:52.700 --> 54:53.440]  really comes in handy.
[54:55.300 --> 54:56.440]  Well, I guess they thought
[54:56.440 --> 54:59.060]  that she couldn't roll out of it.
[55:00.360 --> 55:00.880]  So...
[55:00.880 --> 55:02.400]  Did the couple end up together?
[55:02.680 --> 55:04.600]  Did they get married and settle down?
[55:05.160 --> 55:06.940]  Did they raise the child together?
[55:06.940 --> 55:09.220]  Did the child still find the Papazon
[55:09.220 --> 55:10.860]  to be the most comfortable place to sleep?
[55:12.620 --> 55:13.940]  Maybe. Might be
[55:14.800 --> 55:15.620]  the favorite.
[55:16.540 --> 55:18.160]  Just graduated high school too.
[55:18.540 --> 55:21.040]  Oh shit! So it's a success story.
[55:21.380 --> 55:22.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:22.580 --> 55:24.000]  From humble beginnings, huh?
[55:24.420 --> 55:26.200]  Yeah, from truly humble beginnings.
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.000]  Her first downstairs neighbors
[55:30.940 --> 55:32.000]  left this family.
[55:33.160 --> 55:34.980]  Nick gave this guy money
[55:34.980 --> 55:36.480]  so he could abandon his family.
[55:36.680 --> 55:38.960]  Look, I hung out. That guy had us over
[55:38.960 --> 55:40.640]  for barbecues. He was very nice.
[55:40.740 --> 55:42.580]  He said, I'm short on cash.
[55:42.700 --> 55:44.920]  Can you give me 50? I'll write you a check.
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.400]  No. What did he say?
[55:47.120 --> 55:47.760]  He said...
[55:48.660 --> 55:50.960]  He said, give me 50. I'll write you a check
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.640]  for $100.
[55:52.960 --> 55:54.960]  And I was like, alright. That's fine.
[55:55.020 --> 55:56.700]  I was like, you don't have to. He's like, no, no, no.
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.000]  I insist. I was like, alright, fine.
[55:58.200 --> 55:59.840]  He's like, just wait to cash it. I was like, alright.
[55:59.980 --> 56:02.900]  So I waited about a week. I cashed the check.
[56:03.680 --> 56:04.760]  And what happened to the check?
[56:05.520 --> 56:06.880]  Well, hold on. Before that,
[56:06.960 --> 56:08.820]  his wife came up and was like, have you seen
[56:08.820 --> 56:10.220]  and I said,
[56:10.980 --> 56:12.940]  no. And she's like, neither have
[56:12.940 --> 56:13.300]  I.
[56:14.940 --> 56:16.680]  And that was horrible.
[56:16.940 --> 56:18.740]  And then the check bounced, and I lost
[56:18.740 --> 56:20.440]  $15 in addition to it.
[56:20.740 --> 56:23.240]  And you're out $65.
[56:24.860 --> 56:26.620]  I like the moral of the story is
[56:26.620 --> 56:28.640]  some woman lost her family, but Nick,
[56:28.800 --> 56:30.520]  oh boy, 50 bucks?
[56:30.520 --> 56:32.160]  Nick is out $65.
[56:34.080 --> 56:36.840]  And the gas money to go to the bank.
[56:37.020 --> 56:38.600]  Insufficient funds fee too.
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.480]  I felt really bad. I felt
[56:40.480 --> 56:42.440]  horrible for a long, long time.
[56:42.560 --> 56:43.580]  And then they moved out.
[56:44.380 --> 56:45.660]  Someone broke the window.
[56:47.180 --> 56:48.500]  The cat got into their
[56:48.500 --> 56:49.840]  apartment. There was a hole
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.180]  in the
[56:52.060 --> 56:54.320]  water heater space between the two
[56:54.320 --> 56:56.460]  apartments, and the cat crawled up into our space.
[56:59.280 --> 57:00.020]  And that's
[57:00.020 --> 57:01.380]  how the cat story relates.
[57:03.420 --> 57:05.740]  But the reason it was scary...
[57:05.740 --> 57:07.360]  He told us all this on like a drive
[57:07.360 --> 57:09.280]  home from like a Red Robin, and it was
[57:09.280 --> 57:11.420]  like, what the fuck are you
[57:11.420 --> 57:12.620]  talking about?
[57:12.840 --> 57:14.840]  And here's the other scary bit.
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.180]  I didn't get to finish this part of the story.
[57:17.300 --> 57:19.520]  The reason it was scary is because
[57:21.520 --> 57:23.240]  my roommate and I and his
[57:23.240 --> 57:25.240]  girlfriend had watched Alien
[57:25.240 --> 57:27.280]  or Aliens that night. The baby
[57:27.280 --> 57:29.340]  was sleeping in the Papazon. I came
[57:29.340 --> 57:31.280]  out into the living room where the Papazon was
[57:31.280 --> 57:33.280]  and something darted across the floor, and I was like
[57:33.280 --> 57:34.000]  face me.
[57:36.980 --> 57:38.900]  And also, where's the baby? Where's the baby?
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.040]  Oh, man.
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.300]  Oh, man. So the baby was
[57:43.300 --> 57:45.480]  just on the ground with a rogue cat
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.680]  running around? No, it was in the Papazon.
[57:47.300 --> 57:49.340]  Well, yeah. Nick got there just in time
[57:49.340 --> 57:51.380]  for the cat to stop stealing the baby's
[57:51.380 --> 57:52.760]  breath. Yeah, I was about to say, Jesus.
[57:52.760 --> 57:54.740]  I'm pretty sure I saw a Stephen King movie
[57:54.740 --> 57:55.420]  about this.
[57:57.480 --> 57:58.840]  A Papazon is a
[57:58.840 --> 58:00.000]  chair that is
[58:00.580 --> 58:02.020]  it has like a wooden base.
[58:02.440 --> 58:04.580]  There's so many people in the chat going
[58:04.580 --> 58:06.700]  insane about what a Papazon is.
[58:08.940 --> 58:10.440]  And then it's like a rounded
[58:10.440 --> 58:11.260]  like
[58:12.520 --> 58:13.580]  piece of like
[58:14.320 --> 58:16.780]  wicker wood. Think about such a soft
[58:16.780 --> 58:18.560]  chair for a baby to be in so
[58:18.560 --> 58:20.060]  they couldn't roll out the sides.
[58:20.060 --> 58:21.080]  It's enclosed!
[58:23.420 --> 58:24.220]  Also not my
[58:24.220 --> 58:25.540]  Papazon. Sounds like an ideal baby chair.
[58:27.120 --> 58:28.640]  I wonder if they still have it.
[58:29.820 --> 58:30.300]  I remember
[58:30.300 --> 58:32.120]  when Millie was new, there
[58:32.120 --> 58:33.020]  was always the fear.
[58:35.340 --> 58:36.420]  You fucking knew?
[58:36.580 --> 58:37.360]  We just got her.
[58:37.920 --> 58:40.000]  You know, I always thought like, well, I would never
[58:40.000 --> 58:41.960]  sleep with the kid in bed with me because I'd be scared I'd roll
[58:41.960 --> 58:43.460]  over on it and smother it, you know.
[58:43.800 --> 58:46.100]  And then you put the kid in bed with you and you realize, oh, I'll
[58:46.100 --> 58:48.180]  never sleep well again as long as I live. It's not
[58:48.180 --> 58:50.240]  my concern. I'll never be asleep
[58:50.240 --> 58:52.220]  enough to roll
[58:52.220 --> 58:53.020]  over on it.
[58:57.060 --> 58:57.800]  Oh no!
[58:58.280 --> 59:00.220]  Shit! 98! Last great year!
[59:01.560 --> 59:02.220]  Nice, dude.
[59:03.180 --> 59:04.040]  Oh, nice bone
[59:04.040 --> 59:04.660]  and none.
[59:06.040 --> 59:08.200]  I'm trying to think if there's any other lore from that place.
[59:10.060 --> 59:11.860]  You just dropped baby Papazon's
[59:11.860 --> 59:13.280]  chair today. That's new.
[59:13.460 --> 59:15.660]  How new was she when I ate her shit?
[59:15.660 --> 59:17.760]  She was three weeks old when I ate
[59:17.760 --> 59:19.300]  her shit. What the fuck?
[59:20.220 --> 59:21.080]  Yeah, that's a long story.
[59:21.700 --> 59:22.720]  I don't want to hear it.
[59:29.530 --> 59:30.230]  Dude, people
[59:30.230 --> 59:31.930]  are like hot on the Cosmic Gurgler.
[59:33.110 --> 59:34.070]  It's so cool.
[59:34.250 --> 59:35.050]  It's my favorite design.
[59:35.870 --> 59:36.770]  I think it looks awesome.
[59:37.650 --> 59:39.450]  I've got 10,000 of these things.
[59:40.130 --> 59:41.390]  Oh, I hope it's enough.
[59:43.590 --> 59:44.210]  Me too.
[59:44.650 --> 59:46.390]  It's getting... because it's only getting easier
[59:46.390 --> 59:48.150]  to order these things outside the U.S.
[59:52.680 --> 59:53.300]  It is?
[59:54.960 --> 59:55.600]  Thank you, Nick.
[01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:12.430]  Geoff, you think you can lay down on a bed of nails?
[01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.850]  If I had to, but I would
[01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:15.370]  rather not.
[01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.050]  Could you?
[01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.190]  I don't know if I can do it.
[01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:22.750]  Like mentally or you think
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.230]  like physically? Like both.
[01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:25.590]  I think that
[01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:27.670]  I think I'd like try
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.470]  to lay down on it and then I would get to
[01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.710]  in my head about like what to do
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.390]  on it that I would start moving and then
[01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:35.490]  it would cause a problem. You know what I mean?
[01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:36.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.530]  Because I think you're just supposed to be like still.
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.250]  I don't think you're supposed to move and stuff.
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.750]  They're supposed to be positioned in such a way where you can do it
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.710]  no problem, but I feel like I would
[01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:46.910]  lean a certain way.
[01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:48.650]  A hundred percent, yeah.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.490]  I'm surprised that they stopped at
[01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.110]  beds, the nail company.
[01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:57.150]  You never hear of a chair of nails?
[01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.430]  Or a table of nails?
[01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.270]  Where's the nail Papa's on?
[01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:03.470]  Cool table of nails.
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:06.990]  A waterbed of nails.
[01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:08.810]  I kind of want a Papa's on again, pal.
[01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.750]  You thinking about getting a Papa's on, Nick?
[01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:11.830]  I'm thinking about a Papa's on.
[01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.250]  Do you think waterbeds will ever
[01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.390]  again have a moment?
[01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.150]  Or is it over forever?
[01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:20.990]  I think it's over, man.
[01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:23.190]  I mean, it's definitely over right now.
[01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:27.970]  They're so popular.
[01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.610]  They burn so bright.
[01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:32.570]  Yeah, I would have loved to have tried.
[01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.090]  Weren't they bad for your back?
[01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.350]  Except for when the power went out.
[01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.070]  And then you'd wake up and it was fucking frozen stiff.
[01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.250]  Oh, I didn't think about how they would
[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.150]  carry heat or cold.
[01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.430]  I never considered that.
[01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.790]  They got ice cold.
[01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.790]  That sounds nice for the summer stuff.
[01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.390]  Sleep on a cold block?
[01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:54.430]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.410]  But they were bad for your back, right?
[01:01:57.830 --> 01:01:58.570]  I think so, yeah.
[01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.650]  I would assume so, right?
[01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.210]  Water couch.
[01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:07.490]  Water couch is really funny.
[01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.670]  There should just be more household
[01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.930]  items that could break and cause a flood
[01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:14.550]  at any moment.
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.870]  Scary to think about.
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.750]  Oh no, the table popped a leaf!
[01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.870]  Speaking of
[01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.530]  dumb water filled
[01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:27.690]  devices, I saw
[01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:29.610]  on TikTok a treadmill
[01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:31.730]  that has walls on it and you hit
[01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.750]  a button and it fills up with water so you can
[01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.010]  be up to your chest
[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:37.010]  but on a treadmill.
[01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:39.150]  Whoa, interesting.
[01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.410]  Seems
[01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.490]  like a lot to have in your house.
[01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:45.270]  It does.
[01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.750]  I've seen the ones that are
[01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:50.450]  where you're on a platform and they lower
[01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:51.990]  into a pool.
[01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:53.470]  I've never seen
[01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:55.090]  walls close in.
[01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:00.810]  I want to get so rich
[01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:01.670]  that I can
[01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.670]  do wacky stuff like that
[01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:07.190]  but I don't think that's the wacky stuff I would do.
[01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:07.910]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.370]  I don't think I would have
[01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:12.930]  probably the
[01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.110]  water treadmill
[01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:18.890]  but
[01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:19.330]  like
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.170]  indoor pool? Maybe.
[01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:24.850]  I want to be rich enough
[01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:27.030]  Indoor pool
[01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:29.010]  would be cool, especially if you're up in
[01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:29.310]  Michigan.
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.930]  I want to be rich enough where doctors come over
[01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.390]  and just give you serums.
[01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.270]  Yes!
[01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.130]  Serum sale, awesome dude.
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.630]  You always hear about
[01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:41.470]  I stayed at
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.690]  Jennifer Aniston's house and some guy came over
[01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.710]  and gave us some sort of a B-12
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.990]  shot.
[01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:49.550]  I want to be like that guy who was using
[01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:51.450]  his son's blood to stay young forever
[01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.710]  and he looked like shit.
[01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:54.870]  It was awesome.
[01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:57.530]  He's like, I look so young and it's like
[01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:58.730]  you look wet.
[01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:00.890]  He does look wet.
[01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:02.070]  He just looked wet.
[01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.130]  Oh, what the?
[01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:08.750]  Oh, chest.
[01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:11.990]  Oh, yeah. Somebody said indoor
[01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:13.210]  basketball court. That's me.
[01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:14.930]  That's a cool idea.
[01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.730]  Oh, bowling alley is a really fun one.
[01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.170]  Yeah, like in There Will Be Blood
[01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:21.890]  and they beat someone to death with a bowling pin.
[01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:24.270]  I'm finished.
[01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:25.430]  And then everyone goes, yay.
[01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.830]  You know what would be better than that? A milkshake machine.
[01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.310]  Milkshake machine.
[01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:31.790]  Milkshake machine, but you never
[01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:33.430]  have to clean it. Somebody else gets paid to clean it.
[01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.730]  Oh, dude, if you've got a milkshake machine, you've got
[01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:36.810]  a milkshake machine attendant.
[01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:42.450]  It's like how
[01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.210]  NFL players have
[01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:46.350]  Sonic in
[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:46.830]  their house.
[01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:49.990]  The hedgehog? Yeah.
[01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:52.230]  Or the hamburger restaurant.
[01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.330]  Oh, you're talking about
[01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:55.130]  Sonic Burger.
[01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.870]  See, this
[01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.650]  is where the confusion... Nick knows. This is where the
[01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.030]  confusion comes from. You've got to
[01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:04.910]  specify Sonic Burger and Sonic Hedgehog.
[01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.270]  Yeah, but only
[01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.850]  recently when the movies started getting made.
[01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.210]  Yeah. Oh, punch that.
[01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.470]  Go back. Punch this? Punch.
[01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:14.970]  Yeah, so if you go down there, you can get back up.
[01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:16.790]  Oh, sweet. So you can hop down
[01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:18.630]  without having to worry about how the fuck do I get back up here.
[01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:20.190]  Oh, sweet. Awesome. Thank you.
[01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.890]  What's your favorite
[01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:23.870]  milkshake flavor?
[01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:26.130]  Vanilla, like truly.
[01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:28.350]  Shit.
[01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.930]  Nick?
[01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:31.490]  I'm debating.
[01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:33.630]  Chocolate's usually my go-to, but...
[01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.230]  You asked it. He was deep in thought.
[01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:36.250]  I was.
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:40.110]  Do you go with chocolate or are you still worried about it?
[01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.670]  Yeah. Okay. Canada?
[01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:44.130]  Uh, don't think I've
[01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:45.390]  ever had a milkshake.
[01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.790]  Jesus Christ.
[01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:49.810]  I mean, we've talked about this.
[01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:52.110]  I don't think I've ever had one.
[01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.790]  I may have had, like, once, but
[01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:55.630]  yeah, definitely not enough
[01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.290]  to have an opinion on, like, what's the flavor.
[01:05:57.610 --> 01:05:59.270]  Because I couldn't milk at all when I was growing up.
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.690]  And then, I went in
[01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.410]  to have, like, a surgery thing
[01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:05.570]  and I had to drink a thing and
[01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.490]  my mom lied to me and said
[01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:09.510]  it tastes... yeah, it's becoming the super soldier.
[01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:11.730]  And, uh, she said it tastes
[01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.610]  like milkshakes. So I was like, oh, I'm
[01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:15.450]  excited. I've never had a milkshake before. This is awesome.
[01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:17.670]  And I said it to the doctor and they
[01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.510]  looked at me weird and I was like, that's strange.
[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:21.590]  And then I tried it and it was one of the worst beverages
[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:23.450]  I've ever had. So,
[01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:25.930]  it was just a chalky mess
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.410]  and, uh,
[01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:29.650]  yeah, really. So when I think
[01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.090]  of milkshake, that's what I think of.
[01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.890]  Oh, that's not what a milkshake tastes like. It tastes good like ice cream.
[01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.830]  It's just like,
[01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.530]  what if you could drink an ice cream?
[01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:38.610]  Is really what it is.
[01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.850]  Cookies and cream is probably
[01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.850]  up there, but I just think
[01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.870]  a regular vanilla milkshake
[01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.930]  is, like, really hard to beat.
[01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.690]  For me, it's gotta be strawberry.
[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.710]  Really?
[01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:53.390]  Strawberry is a good shake flavor.
[01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.650]  Especially if it's got little chunks of strawberry in it.
[01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:57.570]  Because I feel like
[01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.790]  strawberry as an ice cream flavor kind of sucks.
[01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:01.730]  Yeah, I agree. Milkshake
[01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.490]  though, quite refreshing.
[01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:05.570]  Yeah, but I like going to Lick and spending
[01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.610]  $18 on ice cream and it's like
[01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:08.550]  mint habanero.
[01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:11.290]  That sounds fancy.
[01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:12.610]  I like their ice creams.
[01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.630]  They are, yeah, it's always like
[01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:17.230]  this one's chorizo cinnamon.
[01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:18.390]  And it's like, what?
[01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:20.270]  This is what?
[01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:23.050]  A chorizo cinnamon ice cream and then bowl in my
[01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.270]  in-home bowling alley. Some rich
[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.150]  guy stuff. They have a German chocolate
[01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.070]  cake. Or sheet cake.
[01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.450]  They have a mango bolognese ice cream.
[01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.410]  Are there rich guy things that
[01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:37.190]  probably aren't actually rich guy
[01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:39.290]  things, but in your head it's like, ooh, that's extravagant.
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:41.290]  For me,
[01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:43.310]  I'm thinking about a bowling ball that is
[01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.390]  filled with water.
[01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.710]  And I'm like, that's extravagant.
[01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.770]  A clear bowling ball with water? Fancy.
[01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.570]  For me, it's two-story
[01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:50.990]  houses.
[01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:54.370]  Like, boat? Just boat
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.530]  in general? Boat, definitely. Boat in general, yeah.
[01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.310]  Yeah, it's like not actually a rich guy thing,
[01:07:58.370 --> 01:08:00.510]  but it is a rich guy thing, but it's not a rich guy thing.
[01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.590]  Yeah, like owning an engine that doesn't
[01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.250]  take you to work.
[01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:06.470]  Oh! That's a great way to
[01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:07.750]  specify a deal. Yeah.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.880]  It's like having a cool
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.400]  motorcycle.
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.560]  What's an old
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.500]  saying about boats?
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.680]  The two best days
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.280]  of owning a boat is when you buy it and when you sell it.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.540]  Yeah, the day you buy it, the day you sell it.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.040]  It's also, it's
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.440]  better to have a friend with a boat than it is to have a boat.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:28.580]  Which is why
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.100]  we've nominated you, Nick.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.220]  Nick, you're buying the boat.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.300]  Yeah, you would hardly
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.160]  buy a new cell phone, but yeah, you'd get the boat.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:37.580]  I got the new cell phone!
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.880]  Did it come in the mail? Yeah.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.460]  You got it? Did you set it up?
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.520]  Yeah, I'm on it. It's great.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.520]  Nick wouldn't buy a new phone.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.440]  His phone's just like, it was like a 12-inch.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.880]  What kind of phone did you have? Did you get an iPhone or an Android?
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:50.800]  iPhone.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.500]  He got the, like,
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.680]  16-whatever, but he was like,
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.280]  I don't want to get it yet.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:08:59.980]  It was
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.780]  the idea that it
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.720]  wouldn't work, and then he wouldn't be able to do
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.280]  something, and it's like, what's not gonna work?
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.060]  And then there was no, sort of like, follow-up.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.920]  But I'm so glad he got a phone.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.120]  I'm so thrilled that Nick
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.160]  got a new phone. It was a pain in the
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.140]  ass because I'm listening to podcasts from
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.240]  like, 11 years ago that don't exist
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.040]  online, so I have to manually... What the fuck?
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.060]  Hold on, stop! So I have to move
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.240]  them over from
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.140]  iTunes, basically.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.040]  I have to ingest
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.060]  them there and then move them over, but all the ones that I
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.920]  had from when I originally downloaded
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.380]  were lost in between. Oh, no.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.300]  You're really that attached
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.400]  to the drunk tank, huh?
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.460]  No, those are all available still, somewhere.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:42.200]  You wouldn't hear Bernie and Gus
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.420]  on an Austin morning show from 14 years
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.700]  ago. Yeah, dude!
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.220]  They actually... One of the most recent
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:50.120]  episodes I listened to, they were both on, and then
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.380]  a week later, Meg was on.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.940]  What? Yeah.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.300]  What the fuck? Yeah, they
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.340]  had Meg on. Boy, we used to own this
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.340]  town. Yeah, what
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:00.860]  happened to Meg?
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.360]  He says from his onion
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.140]  smelling car.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.900]  Joe Rogan happened.
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.340]  Well, if it makes you feel any better, the main host of that show
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.400]  is gone. What does that mean?
[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.420]  Like, dead? He was fired. No, he was
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.320]  fired. That did sound ominous, didn't it?
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.640]  Like the way he says...
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.660]  Come on!
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.280]  It's like...
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:26.720]  What?
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:29.880]  Insane.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.420]  You didn't experience the guy.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.820]  Oh, I didn't?
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:37.680]  It's cause he's gone.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.320]  I've been hearing that. Many are saying this.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.020]  Many are saying.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.540]  Why no road craft, Geoff?
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.160]  Well, cause we're playing
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.200]  Donkey Kong. Yeah. Because your internet
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.320]  might not still work. No, it
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.220]  doesn't, but apparently the guy's back.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.440]  No way! Oh, no!
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.240]  Really? Emily said he had to leave to go get
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.180]  his manager to bring him back. That's the
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:58.680]  latest update.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.240]  Doesn't sound great. Doesn't sound like old
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.880]  Geoff's gonna be watching TV on
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.260]  tonight. That sucks.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.280]  Hanging on my phone. Why? What do you mean?
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.940]  You can watch it here on the giant TV you hate.
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.360]  Oh, that's true. That's true. I could.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.560]  Giant TV you hate.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.880]  Does Geoff hate the giant TV? No, I love it.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.080]  He hates the giant TV. It's not what I'm hearing.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.000]  It's... the interface
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.120]  is so stupid. Point remote. I don't like
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.880]  the... I don't like the
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.220]  operating system.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.720]  Oh, it's such shit!
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.800]  Oh, looks like I'm looking at my
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:33.760]  car temperature.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.680]  Did you not do this one already?
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:42.700]  Uh...
[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.840]  Is there any way to tell if you did or not?
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.180]  I guess we'll find out when you beat it and it doesn't give you anything,
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.100]  huh? Guess so.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.120]  Guess we will.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.260]  I think I did. I think you're right. I think the banana was filled in.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.800]  Did it better this time, though?
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.580]  Yeah, good work.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.700]  Yeah, I did it.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.000]  How are you liking the game so far, Andrew?
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.740]  I'm loving it so much.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.200]  It's the first time where I felt
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.200]  like, yeah, it was a good idea
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:12.940]  to buy a Switch 2.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.560]  So you didn't feel that way after Mario Kart?
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.080]  I'm just not a big
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.140]  Mario Kart guy.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.860]  It was fine. I really enjoyed when we played
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.240]  with the community. That was a lot of fun.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.320]  I'd like to do that again.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.020]  But I'm not
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.240]  going to spend countless hours
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.040]  playing single player Mario Kart by myself.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.360]  But I will play this game a ton.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.960]  I like these collectable
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.660]  collect-a-thon type things.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.180]  This is designed really well.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.880]  It doesn't feel like a slog.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.300]  Especially with the world being so destructible.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.160]  It feels like
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.940]  you can encounter a problem
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.980]  and solve it in a way that
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.020]  makes the most sense to you.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160]  Yeah, my favorite way.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.000]  Yeah, if I ever
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:12:59.980]  play another
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.000]  video game, maybe I'll get a
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.900]  Switch 2 to play this.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.660]  I don't know.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.820]  I only played Sea of Thieves under
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.400]  protest because they're
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.120]  fucking addicted to that.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.120]  Yeah, they're not as
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.600]  into Roadcraft as you are?
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.580]  No, I don't think it's bitten them like it has
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.120]  bitten me, which is fine.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.640]  We're all allowed to like
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.320]  different things.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.280]  That does not sound like you.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.780]  I'm a little disappointed in them, but whatever.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.460]  Well, you know, it took you a little bit.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.800]  So maybe they'll get there.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.220]  We'll see.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.420]  It is fun playing.
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.980]  Sea of Thieves is in a really good place right now.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:40.640]  Is that right?
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.260]  Yeah, so much to do in there.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.160]  There's so much going on
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.580]  and it is so much fun.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.160]  And...
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.600]  They just announced that
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.520]  in 2026 we'll be able to
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.640]  make our own Sea of Thieves server.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:55.300]  Oh, really?
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.940]  Yeah, like a subscription thing.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.640]  I mean, it's pretty far out, obviously, but that'll be cool.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.520]  Be able to customize the world however you want to
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.220]  and have everybody in their own boats
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.440]  if you wanted to do that.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.940]  What am I supposed to do here, Eric?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:08.820]  What am I missing?
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.680]  Can you jump and then hit B?
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.320]  Is...
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.440]  Did you already do this?
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.860]  Like, it's not lit up.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.700]  I understand, like...
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:22.240]  Do you sing to it?
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.640]  Oh, I don't remember.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.600]  I don't remember this not being lit up.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:28.500]  No, I guess not.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.640]  Are you sure you haven't done this already?
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.540]  I mean...
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.880]  I just opened it, but maybe I did.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.260]  Maybe I dug in some way.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:38.880]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.340]  Weird.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:43.660]  Uh...
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.480]  I think maybe you did that
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.560]  and we don't realize that you did.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:46.960]  Okay.
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.160]  Remember when we showed everyone
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.540]  the slideshow of the Gerpler earlier?
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.520]  When we did the last one?
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.040]  I'm curious to see
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.080]  who looks good in the recording.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:00.920]  Charmed is coming.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.500]  We've filmed 66% of it.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.120]  Schedule-wise,
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:07.580]  uh...
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.340]  We have, this weekend,
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.900]  if you're watching this, thank you.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.040]  Oh, we got a Roadcraft video coming out tomorrow.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:14.600]  Sunday,
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.620]  on Patreon,
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.940]  for extra, medium, and above,
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.300]  you get a draft for the One-Hit Wonder Draft.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.780]  And that one has to be on Patreon because
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.280]  a bunch of music and stuff.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.800]  So, the One-Hit Wonder Draft is coming on Sunday.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.120]  You have Gears of War,
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.700]  that's part 13, on Monday.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.700]  Have Sea of Thieves 2 next Thursday.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.600]  Have some Warzone
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.540]  on Saturday the 26th.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.700]  And the Four-Course Mealdraft
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.880]  on Sunday the 27th.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.460]  And finally,
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.400]  on the 28th, is where it all begins.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.360]  That Monday,
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.920]  fog-steered and above,
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.320]  we'll get the Charmed Watchalong.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.360]  Those are the first,
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.100]  it'll be the first two episodes.
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:58.160]  What we've decided is that
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.280]  we're gonna do six episodes
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.960]  and then consider it for Greenlight.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.920]  If we consider it for Greenlight, we'll watch more.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.300]  If not, we have to spin the wheel again
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.280]  and see what decade and what show we land on
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.220]  after that. So,
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.840]  the first episode of Charmed
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.420]  Watchalong will be
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.560]  the first two episodes of Charmed 2018,
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.640]  which you can watch on Netflix.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.840]  And if people wanna watch along with us, it's on Netflix
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.700]  in the US, right?
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.640]  On Netflix, very easy. You just sync it up,
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.620]  Nick counts down, you hit play at the same time,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.280]  and then baby, you're watching Charmed 2018.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.420]  Prepare to have your mind blown.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.780]  I'll say, if you don't live in the US
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.420]  and you don't have a VPN already,
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.080]  probably not worth it for Charmed.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.380]  Wait, don't, well, never mind.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.940]  Oh, sorry. You're fine.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.040]  No, no, no, get your bananas, do your thing.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.140]  You do whatever you want, Andrew.
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.860]  No, I just wanna know what am I missing.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.780]  There was a thing that you missed.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.600]  I missed a thing? Okay.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.220]  Look at that, you got a skill point, though.
[01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:57.550]  Let's hope that I don't logically
[01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:00.070]  make sense when I do that, but...
[01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.910]  Okay, what do we got?
[01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.990]  What'd I miss?
[01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:03.970]  Something in that pipe?
[01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:06.570]  No, on the back side of that,
[01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:07.970]  on the other side of the pipe, look down.
[01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:09.750]  There you go, now look left.
[01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:12.290]  There you go. Oh, right there?
[01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:14.170]  Oh my gosh, what's that? Oh, nice.
[01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:15.970]  Look at the fossil, and there we go.
[01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.830]  I hate these little guys, I wish there was like a spin move
[01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.410]  attack that you could just like fight them all out.
[01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:24.650]  Yeah. There is a spin move,
[01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:26.670]  you spin the left stick in like a circle a bunch,
[01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:28.730]  you'll like do like, yeah,
[01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.270]  he like turns into like a ball, yeah.
[01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:31.750]  Oh, that's cool. Yep.
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.660]  Hell yeah.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.980]  Why did they watch Charm 2018?
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.160]  Because of the wheel?
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.260]  Because of the wheels, what are you talking about?
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.540]  Spun a wheel. What happens?
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.020]  Um, a wheel.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:58.740]  Oh, these sons of bitches.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.020]  They're gonna, they're gonna, you gotta keep going
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.720]  because they're gonna, yeah, appear out of nowhere like that,
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.040]  and you gotta kill them all, just like Metallica says.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.800]  Hold on dog, hold on.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.660]  Oh, there you go.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.220]  Nick is screaming at his dog in the middle of the screen.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.560]  I'll be right back. Oh no.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.440]  Where are they?
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.040]  Halfway there, keep going, keep looking, keep going, keep looking,
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.900]  keep going, you're almost there, keep looking.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:20.980]  There's gotta be another
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.100]  pillar if you look around.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:24.920]  Oh shit,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.040]  over there, Mimi. There you go, there you go, there you go,
[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:27.320]  get him.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.220]  One more time.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:32.760]  Dang.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.740]  Oh, I appreciate they have a retry.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.920]  It sucks when games, like,
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.860]  send you out of the activity, and then you
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.420]  have to go back into the activity.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.660]  Just let me retry this one.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.780]  I wanna play Sloppy Joes Bingo again,
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.360]  I miss it.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.560]  Yeah, we can do that. I had so much fun
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.180]  playing it the other day. We'll do it soon.
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.320]  Do you still play games just
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.340]  at home? You and Emily? No,
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.240]  not since it's not on YouTube anymore.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.660]  It's no longer easy to pull up
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.700]  on my TV, so it's the only time I play it
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:01.700]  when we do it together.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.280]  I'm not good with
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.540]  barriers to entry.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.160]  Sure.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:14.800]  Alright, one more time.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.680]  Oh, over there, I see him.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:19.940]  He's just hiding out on the edge.
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.200]  I saw him.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.700]  Geoff, how you liking Death Stranding 2 so far?
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.000]  I'm sorry, what did you say?
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.120]  How am I liking what so far?
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.200]  Death Stranding 2.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.400]  You're like the biggest Kojima guy
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:35.680]  I know.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.220]  Apparently, everybody keeps telling me
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:41.120]  that Death Stranding 2 is basically
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.260]  Roadcraft. I wouldn't listen to
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.240]  anyone who tells me that.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.320]  It's just about
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:49.000]  planning routes and delivering
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.760]  stuff.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.740]  I just don't think you should listen to people who play
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.920]  Death Stranding 2. And that's nothing against Death Stranding 2,
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.120]  it's mostly against the people.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.700]  Well, I never played the first one.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:19:59.880]  Oh, he did it!
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.200]  Hey, there you go.
[01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.110]  All I know about Death Stranding 2
[01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:14.570]  is there's a character in it named Dollman
[01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:15.750]  and people seem to really like Dollman.
[01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:18.430]  Yeah, Hot Coldman and...
[01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:20.410]  It's so crazy.
[01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:21.510]  It's so nuts.
[01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:22.670]  Domino's Pizza Man.
[01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.850]  Yeah, it's so bizarre.
[01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:28.210]  It's just like the weirdest cameo scene.
[01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.210]  It's like, here's the band Haim. And you're like, what?
[01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:32.370]  What happened? It's Crystal Castles.
[01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:32.970]  Why?
[01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:44.850]  Blue... balloon? What's this?
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.420]  I wish there were more things like that.
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.380]  That's like the only one that
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.400]  I've found so far.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.240]  There should be more punching bag things for
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.700]  Doll Coldman. Absolutely.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:01.960]  Rise and Rinse.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.120]  The classic turn of
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.400]  phrases.
[01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:14.950]  I'm surprised I can't swim at all.
[01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:17.230]  What do you mean?
[01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:18.690]  Oh, like down? Swim down?
[01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:19.970]  Yeah, like swim down.
[01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:23.070]  That was such a big...
[01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:24.950]  Donkey Kong 64, there's a lot
[01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:26.830]  of swimming down. I have a feeling
[01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:28.870]  that it'll be later in the game that you unlock
[01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:30.790]  something once you do it. But it also
[01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:31.750]  doesn't feel like it's a death trap.
[01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:34.830]  What do you think Nick's doing
[01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:35.370]  to his dog?
[01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:38.830]  I think he's
[01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:40.990]  currently doing a snake draft over a burger with it
[01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:42.310]  and he is dominating.
[01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:45.070]  The dog is just like a number one
[01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:46.310]  like best picks and all that shit.
[01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:54.090]  Shit.
[01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:56.510]  Shit.
[01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:08.290]  Okay, here we go.
[01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:10.750]  Get on top of it.
[01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:19.070]  So that's a different kind
[01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:20.370]  of fossil that you
[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:22.610]  use to get a different kind of costume.
[01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:24.050]  Thanks, WhiskeyTomo.
[01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:28.250]  Oh, you have 17 fossils? There are like
[01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.530]  60 on this level alone.
[01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.170]  Dang, hand slap.
[01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:34.090]  Almost.
[01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:38.190]  Can I go higher?
[01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:40.510]  I mean, you see how... do the hand slap
[01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:40.710]  again.
[01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:43.010]  Look a little left.
[01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.430]  See that thing in the wall?
[01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:48.110]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:50.230]  There's like a sonar that you have.
[01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:52.210]  You can upgrade it also so you can
[01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:52.970]  see better through that.
[01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:55.470]  Yeah, this is how you find more stuff.
[01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:58.310]  There's a lot of stuff.
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.900]  Okay, I gotta fix this water shroom.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.800]  Let's look at that for a bit.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.940]  Let's figure this out.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.340]  When are we gonna do a snake draft?
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:11.720]  Below me, I'm guessing.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:16.980]  We're getting on towards
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.900]  the end of the month, which means the dog
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.860]  count's almost done, boys.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.540]  So it is.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.080]  Hard to believe.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.040]  Can't believe we actually stuck to it for a year.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.140]  I think that's probably the best we've ever done with something.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:29.840]  Yeah.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.060]  I'm glad we did.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.320]  This is interesting data.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.000]  Yeah, and data that I never would have thought of
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.300]  one way or the other, you know what I mean?
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.780]  Anybody have any hot dog plans
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.040]  for your final 13 days?
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:44.640]  Not any plans
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.440]  as of yet, nothing firm, but I have
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.080]  I got some ideas.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.600]  Some concepts of a plan, you know?
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:51.940]  Really?
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.480]  Yeah. I haven't even considered making
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.520]  hot dog plans, so I'm gonna
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.300]  look into that. I'm gonna think about that.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.140]  Thinking about hitting
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.220]  Nunya again.
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.540]  That would be the place to do that.
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:04.780]  That would look delicious.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.060]  What's up?
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:18.960]  Uh...
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.280]  Oh, okay.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.160]  I can just break it?
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:24.240]  I had to drop a thing on it
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.260]  last time, so I was like, I need another thing.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.260]  You gotta
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.120]  go get the banana.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:30.880]  Banana!
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:34.120]  Hey, Nick's back. How's your dog? Is he mad at you?
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]  He's good. No, he's fine.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.980]  At the same time that he needed to go out,
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.280]  my wife was like, I need to get him in the car. Can you help me load him up?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.340]  Sure. The dog?
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.560]  Yeah, the dog.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:44.660]  He's going
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.800]  to a doggy hotel
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.620]  thingy. Oh, I thought
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.680]  he was gonna drive the car.
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.980]  No, I mean, he might be able to.
[01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.600]  Yeah, I mean, just based on
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.780]  his memories and instincts, he could probably do it.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:57.900]  He could probably do it.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.440]  What was that movie?
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:02.320]  Homeward Bound?
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.760]  Uh, I watched the end
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:05.680]  of that movie the other day.
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:09.140]  Kind of like
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.520]  all those animals that died making it.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.180]  No, no.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.080]  Make it home?
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.140]  Yeah, but only just.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.440]  There you go.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.620]  It's like all the kids getting to watch each of their animals
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.720]  come back, and then the last one's like, where's Shadow?
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.480]  He's just too old.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.640]  I cry thinking about it.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.100]  It's so good.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.520]  I think that movie
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:36.920]  forever ruined me
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:37.780]  as a kid, you know what I mean?
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.780]  Just like, oh, I always think of that
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:40.480]  when I think of dogs.
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.940]  I think of My Dog Skip
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.200]  when I think of
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:48.500]  definitive dog movies.
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.280]  I don't even know what that is.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.660]  The Frankie Muniz movie?
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.640]  And I think the dog dies.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.600]  It's very sad.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.820]  I think the dog gets beaten to death
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.500]  with a shovel.
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.140]  Good God, man!
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.040]  Sounds like fun, man.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.920]  I think it was a kids' movie
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.840]  and I just remember being distraught
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:08.440]  in the theaters.
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.040]  I think, like, Grave Robbers
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.080]  murder Frankie Muniz's dog,
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.860]  Skip, his cute little dog.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.020]  I haven't thought about My Dog Skip
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:18.540]  in a while.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.700]  My definitive child
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.540]  dog movie would probably be Cujo.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:28.960]  Oh, yeah?
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.060]  That was the biggest dog movie in my childhood, for sure.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.140]  That or Benji.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:36.740]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.880]  You'd probably get a good estimate
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.760]  on somebody's age if you just asked
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.960]  what's the definitive dog movie of your life.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.740]  Yeah. I agree with that.
[01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:51.770]  I would never say it, but I assume
[01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:54.050]  Op would be big. Dog movie draft is maybe
[01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.690]  a good idea.
[01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:57.550]  Have we ever done a dog draft?
[01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:59.770]  Cartoon dog draft or something?
[01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:01.970]  We did a dog draft.
[01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:03.930]  I don't know if I thought about it or if we did it.
[01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:06.150]  What did you say, Nick?
[01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:07.610]  We did a dog draft, didn't we?
[01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:09.950]  Yeah, this would have to be
[01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:11.710]  a definitive dog movie draft, I guess.
[01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.670]  Was it
[01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:14.610]  Fuckface when we did it?
[01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:16.390]  I think it was
[01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:19.610]  one of the first things. We recorded it
[01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.870]  at the end, but released it
[01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:23.570]  in the here and now.
[01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:25.430]  Oh, really? I think so.
[01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:27.410]  It was with Gracie, I think.
[01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.950]  I remember picking Benji for something.
[01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:31.990]  It was with Gracie. It was the fictional dog draft
[01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.750]  is what it was.
[01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:35.770]  It was. It was one of the first things we released
[01:27:35.770 --> 01:27:38.090]  in May. May 19th.
[01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.890]  2024.
[01:27:40.690 --> 01:27:42.030]  Oh, so Willie is
[01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:43.990]  or the dog Skip is hurt in the movie
[01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:46.210]  but he doesn't actually die from his injuries.
[01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:47.810]  Oh, nice. Oh, good. Okay.
[01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:48.910]  He dies later.
[01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.530]  No! Jesus! No!
[01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:53.570]  Come on.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.500]  The kid grows up, goes off to college
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:00.900]  and then
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.240]  his parents call him. Oh, so he dies of old age?
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.980]  Yeah, the dog dies of old age on the
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.980]  kid's bed. Oh, I
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.620]  remember that.
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.800]  I remember walking
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.980]  away from that movie just going, why was this a
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.640]  kid's film?
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.140]  This just made me feel sad.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.080]  Whoa. A lot of movies
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.620]  about people being mean to
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:21.420]  animals.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.140]  That feels like it.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.020]  Like Air Bud, they were mean to that dog
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.320]  before he was a basketball player.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320]  I like when he played football and he got fucking tackled.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.240]  Contact sport, bitch.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.360]  This is what you signed up for.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.400]  I want to see Pat Bev guard
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:40.820]  Air Bud.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.420]  Pat Bev feels like
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:47.640]  you should be in Like Mike 3.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.140]  Is he in China now?
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.320]  Either that or Israel.
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:54.800]  I don't think so.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:56.600]  Oh, really?
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:57.360]  I didn't know that.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.360]  I don't think he's playing in the U.S.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.240]  Definitely not playing in the U.S.
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.840]  He was a good defender.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:07.660]  He had his moments.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.320]  Talked a lot of shit. Fun as hell.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.360]  He's in Tel Aviv.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.140]  February 2025,
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:16.720]  following a loss in the Israeli
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:18.380]  championship, the team announced that Beverly
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.780]  had been suspended.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:20.860]  What?
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.080]  What?
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.100]  Shocking.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.760]  On February 13th, 2025,
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.720]  Beverly parted ways with Tel Aviv.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.960]  Oh, that was fast.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.360]  We're going to see...
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.440]  Reference 89.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.640]  Why did he get suspended?
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.160]  Following a loss,
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:42.720]  announced
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.000]  the suspension, Patrick Beverly suspended from the team
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.240]  until further notice.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.380]  Post game comments,
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.560]  Coach Demetrius addressed the decision
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.480]  not to play Beverly in the third and fourth quarters
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.400]  because I'm the coach and I apologize for the loss
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:56.280]  but it happens. It was my decision.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:58.600]  It does not say a reason
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.480]  that he was suspended.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:00.880]  Crazy.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.900]  Thank you Floppy Disk Repair.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.720]  Cranky Kong!
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.720]  Hey, look at that. It's the Cranky Kong.
[01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.230]  Is he a merchant?
[01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:20.090]  No.
[01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:21.770]  Ah.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.500]  So where does this fit in the Donkey Kong Warrior?
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.640]  Does it not fit in the lore?
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.020]  It doesn't make sense!
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:42.120]  What doesn't make sense about it?
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.180]  He is supposed to be
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.740]  original Donkey Kong
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.460]  but then how Paulina kid
[01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:50.560]  if Donkey Kong, Cranky Kong, same game!
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.440]  Makes no sense, Geoff.
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.480]  Makes no goddamn sense!
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.820]  He's supposed to be the original Donkey Kong
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.600]  but he can't be because of Cranky Kong?
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.220]  Because Cranky Kong
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.060]  is the...
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.960]  Open your ears!
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.020]  Cranky Kong, original Donkey Kong
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:10.580]  how original Donkey Kong
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:12.100]  if Paulina game?
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.580]  Paulina child?
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.300]  Hm.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:24.740]  I'm just imagining Geoff just staring
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.260]  at his plate of onion rings.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.880]  Go to that.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.060]  In the pipe.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.360]  Because Eric and I are in the same room, everything he says
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.440]  is doubled to me so it's very easy
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.060]  to understand anything he says.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.660]  He's learning so much.
[01:31:44.890 --> 01:31:45.850]  He did it.
[01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:48.830]  But outside of the pipe
[01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:49.890]  even more exists.
[01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:50.770]  My goodness.
[01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:52.530]  What an adventure for this monkey.
[01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:55.870]  Kinda ape
[01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:57.970]  is Donkey Kong. Is it just like generic ape?
[01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.890]  I think
[01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:00.550]  generic ape.
[01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:11.490]  There you go.
[01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.870]  Whoa!
[01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:16.530]  Can I climb on this pipe at all?
[01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:17.370]  It's not looking like it.
[01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:19.710]  You gotta jump and make a move.
[01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:20.170]  There you go.
[01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:21.930]  Good luck.
[01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:25.750]  Let's see if you can crack the code on these.
[01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:28.170]  Apparently not.
[01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:28.950]  Nope.
[01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:29.870]  Nope.
[01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.730]  Nope.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.660]  Jamming in traffic. Keep hitting it.
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:40.280]  You can do it.
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.520]  Is he gonna make it?
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.160]  Easy.
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:45.940]  That's fun.
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:46.620]  That's a banana.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:48.500]  Banana.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:49.480]  Banana.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.200]  Is Donkey Kong not a gorilla?
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.200]  Is he? I don't know.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.480]  It doesn't seem like he's
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:58.240]  a gorilla. He just seems like ape.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:58.920]  Right?
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.760]  I believe he's a Donkey Kong.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:02.460]  Yeah.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:05.800]  How do I get
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:08.540]  below this again? I wanna go to a lower platform.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.280]  You just have to look at the map
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:11.840]  and then you find the
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.120]  check mark. No, no.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.760]  Not the check mark. It's the
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:17.240]  uh...
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.340]  What is the lower thing?
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:22.160]  Top right?
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.520]  It's the hole in the top right?
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.620]  Hole in the top right. Oh, okay.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.500]  You see the big hole in the top right? Yeah.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:31.960]  There's that one. There's one other one, but I don't remember where it is.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:32.960]  Okay.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.720]  Let's drop down.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.840]  It's a long toss.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:49.560]  Wow.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:51.360]  Good work.
[01:33:58.690 --> 01:33:59.410]  Don't hit me.
[01:33:59.610 --> 01:34:00.890]  Don't hit me.
[01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.710]  Don't hit me.
[01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:03.650]  I got important work.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.140]  Oh, you
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.680]  fucks. You sons of bitches.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.140]  Hop down
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:17.020]  anyway. I need to break the element. It's like Slime Rancher.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.140]  Testing, test, test,
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:19.860]  test, test, test.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:28.240]  We're going
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.280]  down. We're gonna fix this leak.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:30.720]  Get off.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:33.620]  Nick, what are you muttering to yourself about?
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:35.480]  I'm saying I have to pack and I hate
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.600]  packing. Oh.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.640]  You're gonna have to pack a lot
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.480]  too. Yeah.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:47.580]  A cool milestone is when your
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:49.060]  kid's old enough to pack their own shit.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.900]  Oh God, I long for the day.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:53.360]  Uh oh.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:55.120]  Uh oh. Uh oh.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.740]  Alright, everybody shut up about him. Yeah.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:59.400]  Uh oh. It's Lazy Kong!
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.360]  Hey wait, I heard an extra uh oh.
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:07.080]  Lazy Kong.
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.680]  Oh, you weren't here. Everyone else is
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:09.900]  here.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:12.460]  Lazy.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.620]  How you doing Gavin? If you're gonna be a
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.560]  Kong, what Kong would you be?
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:17.820]  Fuck.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:21.260]  I'm Shitty Kong, based on that.
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.800]  Uh, Wet Kong.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:29.020]  Okay. Wet Kong?
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.140]  Yeah. Wet Kong.
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.100]  Yeah.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.000]  You missed it Gavin, Eric and I made Onion Rings.
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:35.980]  At the office.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.340]  Oh, is it a video?
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:39.660]  No.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.860]  We're doing a video right now.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.900]  The thing you're watching right now, this is a video.
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.340]  I mean, it's pretty lazy
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:48.760]  of you to not make a video, right?
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:51.340]  While you're making this one. Oh, they might be Lazy Kong.
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.600]  That's a good point. Of
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.560]  turning on the air fryer?
[01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:58.780]  You know what? Eric swayed me.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.600]  I'm sorry.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.900]  Did you say that sounds pretty exciting?
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.920]  That's not bad, right?
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.760]  I don't think it's good.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.500]  Uh oh.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:10.720]  Hey, dude, I don't want to rain on your parade, but
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.800]  Jorky Belfus just gifted five subs.
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.760]  Jorky Belfus!
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.400]  Thank you so much.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.880]  We were discussing earlier about Jorky Belfus
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.940]  being the reason you're not here.
[01:36:23.970 --> 01:36:24.810]  Fuse to
[01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:25.670]  participate.
[01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:28.790]  With Jorky
[01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:29.830]  in the mix.
[01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.950]  I can get outfits now?
[01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:32.530]  Yeah.
[01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:34.770]  What are you thinking?
[01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:38.830]  Oh, Gav, how would you feel if we did
[01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:40.750]  an episode? You remember we did the episode of the
[01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:42.570]  podcast where we all had our bottoms off?
[01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:44.090]  We were all Winnie the Pooh in it?
[01:36:44.490 --> 01:36:46.890]  What if we did an episode of the podcast
[01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:48.950]  Donkey Kong style where we only wore
[01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:49.470]  ties?
[01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:52.550]  Cocks out, ties out?
[01:36:53.290 --> 01:36:54.930]  Yeah, just like ties and cocks.
[01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.550]  That's all we have.
[01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:56.550]  Huh.
[01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:59.070]  I'd be into it.
[01:36:59.730 --> 01:36:59.950]  Okay.
[01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:03.680]  The ties in this game, they give you little boosts.
[01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.550]  Yep.
[01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:06.930]  Go to the...
[01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:07.770]  Turn around.
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:10.670]  Go to the armoire thing.
[01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:14.150]  Got it.
[01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:17.230]  Geoff slowly inching towards OnlyFans.
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:20.330]  Whatever it takes.
[01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:23.370]  I think we should all
[01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:25.150]  pick our ties and then explain what
[01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:26.330]  boosts they give us.
[01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:29.330]  Audience, I'm just trying to get us to the point where we don't
[01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:31.550]  have to share one hamburger between the four of us.
[01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:35.330]  Oh yeah, you missed a hamburger
[01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:36.110]  draft, Gavin.
[01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:37.610]  Oh.
[01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:40.210]  We did a little impromptu draft.
[01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:43.190]  I got ketchup and mustard.
[01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:45.090]  He got hands down.
[01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:46.770]  Back to back.
[01:37:47.190 --> 01:37:48.770]  I destroyed you guys in that draft.
[01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:51.510]  Hey Gavin, we also
[01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:53.330]  showed the teaser
[01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:55.070]  for the Cosmic Gerpler.
[01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:57.250]  How was that? You want to talk about shooting that?
[01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:59.690]  I had fun
[01:37:59.690 --> 01:38:00.470]  shooting it.
[01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:02.810]  Thanks man.
[01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:05.270]  Be careful,
[01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:07.490]  Eric, last time I tried to do this with him, he
[01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.290]  told me, do you want to watch the video?
[01:38:09.690 --> 01:38:11.490]  Which I said yes, and then learned
[01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:13.610]  weeks later that was him being sarcastic.
[01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:15.590]  No, I wasn't being sarcastic.
[01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:17.390]  I was saying, do you actually want to know everything
[01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:19.710]  about it? Do you want it spoiled or do you just want to watch it?
[01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.790]  I mean if you
[01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:22.330]  watch...
[01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:25.750]  That's an insane take by you, someone who loves
[01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:27.930]  watching behind the scenes and
[01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.450]  commentaries
[01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:31.950]  and all of that shit. This guy is nuts.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:37.140]  I saw Lord of the Rings, I get how they
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.440]  made it. Yeah, they went up the mountain, they threw the ring in.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.040]  They added spiders and shit.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:43.120]  It's crazy. New Zealand's crazy. I can't believe
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.860]  they had these trees walking around.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.240]  I don't watch the behind the scenes before I watch the movie.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.600]  Dip ass, what do you mean?
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.280]  Dip ass.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.320]  First of all, how did you know my legal middle name?
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.300]  Second of all, how dare I
[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:03.240]  attempt to express interest in a thing
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:05.180]  you do? Never again.
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.180]  I just wanted you to talk
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.220]  a little bit about your thought process and what it was
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.260]  like to film it, but this is fun too.
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.120]  I just... I find myself
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.080]  arguing with Andrew over... I can't...
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.440]  Like, you were asking everything about it,
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.240]  and I just thought, am I going to tell you
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.400]  everything about it, or do you want to wait to watch it?
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:30.480]  And you took that...
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.440]  I feel like the point of the segment
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.440]  in the podcast was like, let's talk about the
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.240]  Gerpler a bit and promote it.
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:40.100]  And so, they threw it to you
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.300]  and you're like, yeah, made a video.
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.320]  So that's trying to...
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.720]  Oh yeah, I made a video.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.400]  Eric, I enjoyed making it. It was pretty much
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.060]  a parody of the first one I made.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.220]  But with a little bit of
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.420]  cosmic stank.
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.020]  Is this a time where I can submit notes
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:57.320]  to you?
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:01.060]  Yeah, it's out now, so if you got any notes...
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.860]  I got some notes.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.280]  I got some notes for the third one.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.040]  I don't want you to Beverly Hills Cop 3
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:07.740]  this thing.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.220]  I mean, it's the best action in it.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.060]  Worst plot.
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.460]  Oh, dude.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.020]  I feel insane. I feel crazy.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.380]  I feel crazy.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.960]  I feel like I cheated that. I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.840]  No, no, no. You're supposed to throw a rocket
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.160]  at that thing and it makes it a platform.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:30.040]  I like giving everybody
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.280]  a smooth head in this game.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.680]  Just smoothing it out.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.340]  Just haircuts.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.100]  Gavin, how you doing on this
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:40.060]  lovely day where you couldn't make it for the stream?
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.500]  But we're so happy to have you now.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:43.980]  Well, I mean, technically I made it
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]  for the normal time, right?
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.900]  That's true. You're actually
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:49.980]  a little early. Yeah, that's fine.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.980]  It's just, you know, I was just...
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:53.300]  Doesn't matter. Who cares?
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:54.440]  See?
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:57.060]  Never mind.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.460]  I appreciate it, Gavin.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.300]  I had to lug a bunch of recording stuff to
[01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.620]  a different state.
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:05.440]  That's never fun. No.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:08.160]  Well, I hope it went well.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.020]  I didn't know that you were recording stuff
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:12.800]  while you were there.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:14.840]  I'm recording this.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.560]  Don't you just want to give up?
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.020]  You sound like you're on your phone or talking into
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.940]  a laptop. Like, it doesn't sound like you brought a
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.320]  fucking studio with you.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:30.960]  That's what we talked about.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.000]  I thought you were doing some one-wheeling.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.900]  The way you phrased that made it sound like you were
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.180]  bringing slow-mo equipment or something to film content
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.200]  there. No, I just brought a mic.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:47.140]  That's definitely...
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:47.860]  That was probably
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.460]  in slow-mo equipment too.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.000]  Eric had to leave.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.820]  He's just shaking his head in the kitchen.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.160]  Is it the wrong mic picked on Discord still?
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.620]  Not anymore, I don't think.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.440]  I have to, like, pick my mic
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.700]  and then I have to select off it and then back onto it, I guess.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:08.140]  Tap it.
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.000]  Let's see if it's the right one. That's not what I wanted.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:10.600]  Build a wall.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.400]  Oh, no. Oh, no!
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:14.340]  Shit!
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.720]  Oh, shit!
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:22.020]  Also, we can talk about it in the
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:23.480]  podcast,
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.120]  but walked in today to
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.660]  a surprise in the living room
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:32.360]  that me and Andrew were not aware of.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:34.980]  Uh...
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.380]  Very strange, but very exciting.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.620]  It works. Eric fixed it.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:41.180]  Yeah.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:44.720]  It's the coolest thing.
[01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.500]  I think he's gone and he doesn't care,
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.020]  so it doesn't matter. No, no, I'm just
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.120]  trying to figure out my mic.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.680]  I was hoping I could build a dirt wall all the way across.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.920]  Why don't you just go and climb it?
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.600]  I was right there
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.340]  with you, Andrew. I thought that would be cool as well.
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:13.660]  Okay.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.520]  Whoa!
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.780]  That was...
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.620]  Good first throw, buddy.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:26.940]  Wow.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:30.820]  Easy. Banana.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.000]  Oh!
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:33.980]  Banana.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.580]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:40.800]  Shellshock. How are you enjoying the
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.860]  old Dilkong so far?
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.740]  I'm loving it. Have you played
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.700]  any of it, Gavin? Yeah.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.920]  I think I'm one further
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.600]  ahead than this. Okay.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:52.780]  Is this the second
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:54.080]  level? Is this where you are, Eric?
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.620]  I'm one further than this as well.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:57.200]  Wow.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:43:59.740]  You and Gavin are synced up.
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.300]  Yeah, we're synced up.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.000]  They get their periods together.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.760]  We get our periods at the same time. Thank you very much.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.740]  We've been playing co-op. I'm the
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.920]  rock. I forgot that this game is
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.840]  co-op. Yeah, I told that to Blaine
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.760]  this morning because Kristen's been playing it
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.700]  like fucking crazy.
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.620]  And I'm like, oh yeah, I just found out it's co-op.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.640]  And he went, what?
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.300]  I could play it too?
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.040]  And it's like, okay, Andrew.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.600]  Go back down.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:30.700]  I haven't seen... I gotta figure out
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.760]  how to take out this thing. I haven't seen any of the co-op
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.740]  yet, but it seems like...
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:36.520]  I don't know.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.860]  Donkey Kong and this thing
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.800]  like throws rocks and shit.
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:41.940]  Yeah, I think
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.820]  you play as Pauline and like you sing
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.780]  shit. Are you just noticing
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.020]  this guy you were around him for?
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:49.920]  I was looking at other things.
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:51.660]  Is this how he on the map works?
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.060]  I don't want to tap you out!
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.160]  Is that what I'm trying to do?
[01:44:56.260 --> 01:44:57.420]  Oh god, no!
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.780]  We're just high-fiving.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.940]  How are you high-fiving
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.400]  that? That makes no sense.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.820]  That's brutal. I'm pretty sure
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.400]  that's a hate crime. Okay.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.060]  Fuckin'
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:14.740]  you missed!
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:15.700]  Bounce!
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.080]  There we go.
[01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:22.010]  I didn't feel worth it.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:23.250]  Whoa!
[01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:25.210]  Did that?
[01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:27.850]  Definitely not.
[01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:32.830]  Where do I...
[01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:33.630]  Ooh.
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:38.460]  So I gotta...
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.060]  Oh, that thing.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:41.060]  I gotta destroy that thing.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.520]  Let's go that way.
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.980]  Somebody said this is like watching Nick play Tony Hawk.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.480]  Yep. No!
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.080]  You didn't watch Nick play Tony Hawk if you think this
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.120]  is like Nick playing Tony Hawk. It's pretty similar.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.780]  Oh my god, it's incredible.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.260]  It is just like, it's so crazy.
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:57.420]  You had a good time.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:58.820]  This is not going to be worth your time. I'm just letting you know.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:45:59.520]  Yep. Yep.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.440]  Had a feeling.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:04.980]  But I got my swim trunks on that make me swim faster.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:05.820]  So I just wanna...
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.920]  What I was really impressed with
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.860]  is that Nick was like,
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.480]  Oh, I've played this before. But then he's like,
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.520]  Oh, but I did play it on GameCube. So that makes sense.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.140]  And it's been 20 years.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:16.720]  The controller is so different.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.040]  It is still confusing to watch.
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.140]  Confusing to play, too.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:23.920]  You can watch the whole thing.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:26.320]  And then a lot of the comments are like,
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.160]  How come you don't see everyone else's perspectives?
[01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.020]  And it's like, it's not a regular video.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.120]  It's just a stream.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.180]  Just from Nick's perspective.
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:36.740]  And I think that seeing other people's perspectives
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:38.980]  in that game, like in that particular stream,
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.660]  would have been so much worse
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.300]  than seeing just Nick's,
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:44.580]  which was so good.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.820]  It was, I mean,
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.560]  so good. It was incredible.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:50.660]  The fact that Nick knew it was just Nick
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.520]  means it was...
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.740]  his reactions were so much better.
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:55.500]  He's so...
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:57.960]  mad.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.120]  His kid is trying to show him stuff.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:01.420]  But it's so good.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.240]  Ooh, what dropped down there? Is that a record?
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:06.500]  Go...
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.520]  go down there.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.380]  Or don't go down there. It's up to you.
[01:47:10.660 --> 01:47:11.380]  Check it out.
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.700]  I have no idea.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.420]  I don't know that I've ever seen something
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.320]  go down in the water like that that you can't get.
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.560]  Wait, can you hit the clap button?
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.020]  Can I hit what?
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.840]  No, that's it. Damn. I don't know.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.300]  Yeah, you can't really go under water. You can jump and dive down
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:27.420]  to get a bit of depth, but I think you'll float back up.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.220]  Yeah. I don't know. Weird.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.320]  It's like a record.
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:35.360]  Maybe it's the DK rat.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:36.880]  Whoa!
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.240]  We gotta get it.
[01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.830]  Let's see.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.900]  I can go down a little bit,
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:49.760]  but I don't think enough.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:51.880]  Did it despawn? Oh, no. It's right there.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:52.140]  Okay.
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.180]  Let's try one more time.
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.920]  Can you just throw something at it?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.720]  I don't know what there is to throw at it, though.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:03.480]  Brock?
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.240]  Monkey web?
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:06.060]  Hahaha!
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:07.820]  They got monkey web!
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:09.720]  Damn.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:11.480]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.120]  You gotta unlock
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.460]  Bonanzamo to get monkey web.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.060]  Monkey web.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.980]  So, I gotta go across
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.060]  according to this guy and talk to his friend.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:29.320]  According to this guy.
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.420]  What I like about this is the little guy says
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:33.820]  I live for fishing, and then you beat up the boat, and then he says something different.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.520]  He's like, oh, I was overdue for a swim anyway.
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:37.160]  Ah!
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.700]  They all do that.
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:41.760]  I like the little
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.040]  humor pieces in this game.
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.800]  They usually seem fine that you're
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:46.560]  trashing the place.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.720]  I was saying something earlier
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.760]  about, like, I really
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.480]  like that this isn't a game where
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.560]  all of the monkeys make fun of Donkey Kong
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.280]  because he's a big, dumb ape or whatever.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.640]  Every time Donkey Kong shows up, everyone's going
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.540]  hell yeah, Donkey Kong, now you can help us
[01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:03.640]  because you fucking rule, and you're Donkey Kong, and that's fucking
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:05.300]  sick, and it's like, that's...
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:06.240]  I love that.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.920]  I want to be the good guy
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.440]  and have fun and do this.
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:12.980]  I really do enjoy it.
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.680]  I had a funny moment earlier, I think it was the level
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.220]  after this, where I was just
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:19.520]  I just got into the level and I was about to turn the game off
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:21.580]  so I just went ape shit and started just smashing
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:23.580]  up everything I could see for like a minute straight.
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.580]  And I even smashed through, like, one
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:26.840]  of the people you could talk to.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.920]  And then they reformed
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.800]  and said, hey, thanks for checking
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.700]  out my shop. Feel free to look around.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.680]  There was nothing there.
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.860]  There was literally everything
[01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:38.320]  was gone.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.760]  I really want to get the
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.720]  white fur ape color.
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.920]  I want to be Snow Ape. I want to be the invulnerable
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.520]  yeti in Donkey Kong.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.820]  Oh, be Rampage Ape? Rampage the Movie
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:52.380]  Ape? Yeah.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.460]  Did you see Rampage the Movie, Andrew?
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:56.520]  No.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.060]  Hey, Gavin, what kind of
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.120]  ape do you think Donkey Kong is? Do you think he's generic
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.580]  ape or do you think he is, like, gorilla?
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:11.460]  Um...
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:12.580]  Yeah, it's gorilla.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.120]  You think so?
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.000]  Well, I mean, if Lanky Kong
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.200]  was the orangutan.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.060]  Uh-huh.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:23.180]  Diddy little chimp.
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:24.060]  Uh-huh.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.340]  What was the other ones?
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:28.760]  Tiny Kong?
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:30.700]  Yeah, what was that?
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.260]  Little spider monkey?
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.760]  No, Tiny
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.920]  Kong was like the big one, wasn't it?
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:37.800]  That was Chunky.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:40.680]  Chunky?
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.580]  Chunky Kong was the big one.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]  Was it? I don't remember.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:48.680]  Seems like a missed opportunity to make
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.740]  Tiny the big one. That's what I
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:51.200]  was thinking.
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.440]  Like a little John?
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.080]  Are you as upset
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.960]  about the Donkey Kong canon
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.920]  as Eric is, Gavin?
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:04.260]  I don't think I fully understand
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:05.980]  how annoyed to be about it. What's the
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.420]  latest on it? What do you mean?
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:09.700]  Like, what are you annoyed about?
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.100]  What do you...
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:13.800]  Cranky is in this game.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:15.500]  Hello?
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:16.920]  Yeah.
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:19.700]  What does that mean? Yeah!
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.040]  How? That's exactly
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.840]  what I'm saying. Exactly.
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.480]  What does it mean?
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.300]  It was...
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:29.420]  I wish it just remembered
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.420]  you did this and you didn't have to do this every time.
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.540]  He was in
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.500]  Donkey Kong 64.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.920]  Donkey Kong original monkey
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.760]  Cranky Kong
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.660]  Pauline kid in game. How?
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.440]  Time hole.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.440]  What is time hole? I win.
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:50.200]  I got it.
[01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:55.310]  Every time you do your
[01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:57.450]  Donkey Kong lore voice, Eric, I like to imagine
[01:51:57.450 --> 01:51:59.590]  it as a phrased Jeopardy
[01:51:59.590 --> 01:51:59.950]  question.
[01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:03.410]  That is how that
[01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:05.390]  question is. This is what Jeopardy is.
[01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:09.610]  How do Vin Diesel
[01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:10.510]  car move good?
[01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:13.570]  Like, half thought, like too mad
[01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:15.630]  half thought out, like it's good.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.360]  It's the boom-bomb?
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.160]  Hey, I need you.
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:27.680]  You gonna take his head?
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:28.880]  Yeah.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.080]  Nice toss. Yeah!
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.220]  Oh, it's gonna shoot.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.680]  Wet car. That's why they stopped making waterbeds.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:43.360]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:44.640]  Have you ever slept on a waterbed?
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:46.980]  Never.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.360]  We should get one for Gavin.
[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:50.260]  Yeah.
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.620]  I mean, could that just be the napping bed at the office?
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:55.720]  Filled with
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.800]  water? I wish we had room for it.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.540]  Maybe in the
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:01.380]  whatever the fuck you guys have going on in your secret spot.
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.560]  If you guys finish your fucking show already
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.320]  maybe we can make something happen.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:06.920]  That's the show.
[01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:09.680]  Nick and Gavin podcasting on a waterbed
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.080]  together.
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:12.680]  Making waves.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.880]  That's why it's called Making Waves.
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:17.340]  That's pretty good.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.320]  You're good at this, bud.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.760]  Do you think we could get a waterbed that is
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.920]  also like one of those pool things
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.740]  or like ocean things where you jump
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.840]  in it and it launches the person into the water?
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:29.840]  Do you think we could do a launch
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.520]  off a waterbed?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:35.900]  Give me that
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:37.940]  skill point. I want more punching power.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:39.640]  What skill are you going for next?
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.540]  Just punching power.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.440]  I'm all in on punching power.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.960]  He doesn't really use like the
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.020]  sonar for anything.
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:49.580]  He's
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.980]  pretty straightforward with punching straight
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:53.160]  up in the air.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:55.800]  That's how
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.080]  DK punches. But punching power only helps
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.640]  you punch stronger stuff, right?
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.020]  Yeah. Is there any
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:03.700]  strong stuff on this level? No.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:05.980]  No, but when I get to
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:07.760]  a point where I need it, I'll be good. I'll be set.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:09.780]  You know, like
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:11.880]  the level that you go to
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:13.900]  after this, like the one we're on, Gavin, is still terrain
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.720]  level 2. Yeah.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.760]  I'm going to fly past it though when I get there.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.940]  You guys are going to be like, oh, I need to level up my punch power
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.600]  and I'm going to be like, I'm there.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:22.260]  Did it.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.840]  I don't need the health good enough as this.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:27.520]  I definitely didn't need the health.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.980]  But the sonar
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:31.980]  and the clap
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.440]  so you pick stuff up
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.000]  that's like around you, that felt like critical.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:37.960]  Maybe not for you
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.940]  based on how you play, but...
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:42.680]  Oh no.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.800]  It's all slippery now.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.020]  You gotta swim all the way around.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:47.980]  Oh boy.
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.920]  It's all slippery.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.860]  Grab the rope, DK. Grab the rope.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:56.940]  Oh.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:54:59.260]  Interesting.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.500]  Okay, so I need water to do that.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.180]  I'm surprised you went green.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.640]  It's over there.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.740]  You know, we got
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:17.200]  purple on my back, green as the Kong.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.620]  A little gerpal thing going.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.020]  If only.
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.320]  If only it was that easy.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.580]  I thought since I leveled up my punching power, maybe I could just
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.160]  break through it.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:30.660]  No, but you're ready
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:31.600]  to play on level eight.
[01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:40.030]  Water.
[01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:42.490]  Saved. Is that the boss fight
[01:55:42.490 --> 01:55:43.690]  of the level, I'm assuming?
[01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.750]  That Yu-Gi-Oh-esque disc?
[01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.310]  No.
[01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:48.510]  Okay, well.
[01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:50.330]  Go over there anyway.
[01:55:51.730 --> 01:55:53.130]  That's a lot of shipping containers.
[01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:55.290]  Yeah, monkeys
[01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:56.250]  ship a lot of stuff, dude.
[01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:59.290]  Tariffs, you know, they like to send
[01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:00.390]  a lot right now.
[01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:03.250]  This game feels very
[01:56:03.250 --> 01:56:04.810]  Mario Odyssey to me.
[01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:06.990]  It is. It's Mario Odyssey.
[01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:09.130]  Yeah, it's definitely like Mario Odyssey
[01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:10.590]  on steroids. It's pretty crazy.
[01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:13.270]  Where am I supposed to
[01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.990]  take this thing?
[01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:16.910]  Did they make anything in between
[01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:18.190]  this and Mario Odyssey?
[01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:20.250]  No.
[01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:21.390]  Wow.
[01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:28.570]  Are you serious?
[01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.270]  Yeah.
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:40.500]  The mighty Kong that sits before
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:40.840]  you.
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:43.580]  Oh, it's an elder Kong.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:46.300]  Is he even
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:48.540]  banana beard? That's the original
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.220]  Donkey Kong.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:52.360]  I think it is
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:52.920]  a banana beard.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.220]  Bananas are skulls.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:57.800]  Both.
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.740]  Is Kong the original
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:08.680]  Donkey Kong in the Kong universe?
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:09.400]  King Kong?
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.540]  I don't know.
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.100]  Who owns King Kong?
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:15.080]  Is that universal?
[01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:24.910]  I really feel like there should be a King Kong.
[01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:25.570]  Universal pictures?
[01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:28.330]  Nope.
[01:57:28.330 --> 01:57:29.890]  High five.
[01:57:36.130 --> 01:57:37.710]  That's another record. Maybe that's
[01:57:37.710 --> 01:57:39.270]  related to the record in the sea.
[01:57:39.610 --> 01:57:40.410]  I think it is.
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:53.570]  Oh shit, it's episode 16.
[01:57:58.090 --> 01:57:59.250]  Show us what you got.
[01:58:02.410 --> 01:58:04.210]  We waking up Pauline now?
[01:58:12.340 --> 01:58:13.580]  Yeah, drum beat.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:16.760]  Pauline!
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:20.040]  Nick's favorite part of the game.
[01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:33.300]  Would it fix the law if Cranky Kong
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.420]  recognized her?
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.340]  Maybe she was trapped in the rock
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:40.920]  and it de-aged her.
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.300]  These are all good fan theories that I'm going to make
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.700]  you long YouTube essays about.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.520]  Okay.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:50.400]  I think that rich guy tried
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.560]  de-aging the arachnid.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:54.760]  Yeah!
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:19.460]  Jump jump superstar?
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:20.800]  You wish.
[01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.380]  Now she sings in a language
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.400]  that is not English, it's so weird.
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:31.760]  Oh what, really?
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.520]  Yes, I hate this.
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.540]  She's singing in monkey.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:38.040]  Yeah, I think that sucks.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.620]  I don't like the monkey language.
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:49.580]  It's like listening to a song in Simlish.
[01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:53.680]  Do you think it's a money saving
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:55.520]  tactic for the foreign markets?
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:56.380]  Absolutely.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.340]  It just keeps punching up.
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:05.780]  You punching up really is...
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.700]  I think punching up might be my least used.
[02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:12.740]  Because you could also just jump.
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:19.100]  Gotta get my banana energy up.
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:19.720]  Gold!
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:21.600]  Just slap.
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:23.640]  Don't bother.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.420]  Just don't bother.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:27.800]  Here we go.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.120]  Here we go.
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:38.100]  This is
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.380]  unreal to watch.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:42.460]  It's so great.
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:45.040]  This is like IGN posting
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.740]  like, yeah, I played this game
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:48.600]  2 out of 10, and it's like this.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.040]  You didn't do it, Sean.
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:55.640]  You climbing over those things was nuts, dude.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.520]  I didn't even know you could fucking do that.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:59.040]  That was crazy.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.400]  You could have done that as regular.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.680]  They didn't even
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.080]  need the fucking big
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.480]  mean ape or whatever. That's right, that's how good I am.
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:13.240]  I don't need that. I don't need the elite version.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.200]  Natural talent.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.300]  Do you ever get haircuts?
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:21.600]  Who?
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:24.440]  This guy. That'd be tough to cut.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.520]  I wonder if the bananas grow.
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:28.000]  Bananas are pretty soft.
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:30.440]  Yeah, it just would be
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:31.360]  awkward to shape.
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.460]  There you have it.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.100]  I think he's wearing Beats
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:41.440]  by Dre.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.020]  That's why they're
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.500]  hidden. No product placement.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:49.300]  Comm-X Beats.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.580]  I can't say the C word.
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:58.020]  Hell yeah!
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:04.880]  Whoa!
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.820]  This was, again, Blaine going to this
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:10.080]  fucking hot ape show, though.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.040]  What the?
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:13.980]  Oh, right.
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:16.760]  Blaine wants to bang
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.260]  the ape. The hot ape.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:21.080]  Forgot about that from the beginning of the stream.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:21.700]  Yep.
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:27.000]  She reminds me of
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.580]  a design you'd see in Ape Escape.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.000]  Now that we don't work together, nobody can complain
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.960]  to HR about my jokes anymore.
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:37.040]  Nobody can say,
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:38.660]  hey, so-and-so wants you to
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:39.640]  take it easy.
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:42.980]  This guy doesn't want to have sex
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:43.500]  with the monk.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:48.680]  And now that
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.920]  we don't have an HR department, I guess there's nobody
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.620]  for you to see Coldplay with, Geoff. I'm sorry.
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:58.260]  It's a real loss.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:01.920]  That's good.
[02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:11.620]  I just like Andrew's playing
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:13.420]  like he's a pair of scissors.
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.000]  It's... you can't...
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.020]  I've had to, like, just
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.980]  sort of, like, come to terms with, like, I don't
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:21.940]  enjoy seeing it. Like, it makes me mad.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:23.440]  I don't like it.
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.520]  How would you be different right now?
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:28.100]  Stop punching up! I would punch straight.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.760]  I'd turn into my big monkey form,
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:30.920]  punch straight and kill this guy.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:31.020]  Okay.
[02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:37.170]  I tried to get one of these.
[02:03:37.330 --> 02:03:38.390]  Let's go big monkey. Let's go big ape.
[02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:51.610]  Geoff, do you have internet yet or what?
[02:03:52.130 --> 02:03:52.650]  Take that.
[02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:55.410]  Have they updated your
[02:03:55.410 --> 02:03:56.390]  internet or anything yet, Geoff?
[02:03:56.890 --> 02:03:59.130]  Hold on a second. You just killed Majora's Mask.
[02:04:02.170 --> 02:04:02.690]  Uh...
[02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:04.190]  No.
[02:04:04.810 --> 02:04:06.090]  They're still working on it.
[02:04:07.290 --> 02:04:07.810]  900.
[02:04:08.610 --> 02:04:10.610]  Gavin had a bad day with technology.
[02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:12.030]  2700.
[02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:14.050]  I can hear it in your voice.
[02:04:15.370 --> 02:04:15.990]  Pretty brutal.
[02:04:16.290 --> 02:04:18.650]  I just don't get how it would go out like that.
[02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:19.930]  I don't either. I don't either.
[02:04:20.370 --> 02:04:20.890]  Midstream.
[02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:24.290]  Seven hours later.
[02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:25.570]  Still working on it.
[02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:27.790]  But again, to be out for as long
[02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:29.470]  as it is is so crazy
[02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:31.950]  when it's like you were in the middle of streaming.
[02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:33.010]  Yes.
[02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:35.190]  To have to have
[02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:37.310]  a manager come over to evaluate.
[02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.930]  Yeah.
[02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:39.710]  That's crazy.
[02:04:40.050 --> 02:04:43.590]  I wonder if it's just you.
[02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:47.290]  I wonder if there's a bunch of people in your neighborhood
[02:04:47.290 --> 02:04:48.770]  that are like, internet's fucking gone.
[02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:51.830]  I hope it's just you.
[02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:54.090]  Just purely
[02:04:54.090 --> 02:04:54.970]  for the comedy of it.
[02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:56.250]  I feel bad.
[02:04:56.890 --> 02:04:58.550]  I really appreciate that.
[02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:00.750]  You know what?
[02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:02.290]  Maybe I do have it.
[02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:03.870]  It's the funniest version.
[02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:06.890]  Eric, I think I do have an enemy in Canada.
[02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:08.250]  Yeah, I think so too.
[02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:11.290]  I'm on your side.
[02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:13.710]  He's on your side, Geoff.
[02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:19.390]  It's pretty bad.
[02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:20.650]  It's not good.
[02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:23.390]  If you're gonna go through something bad, at least let it be
[02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:25.310]  the funniest version of that bad thing.
[02:05:25.330 --> 02:05:25.730]  I agree.
[02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:28.710]  He does have an enemy in Canada.
[02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:30.570]  Pop five balloons.
[02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:33.870]  One.
[02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:42.510]  Two.
[02:05:44.110 --> 02:05:44.590]  Three.
[02:05:46.230 --> 02:05:46.470]  Nope.
[02:05:46.670 --> 02:05:48.790]  Stop counting.
[02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.870]  Stop counting.
[02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:52.210]  You're at three now.
[02:05:53.770 --> 02:05:54.910]  How are you still alive?
[02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:56.850]  You didn't kill him.
[02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:02.470]  God, if all the enemies were above me, they'd be fucked.
[02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:20.570]  Can I climb? Oh, I'm missing one.
[02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:21.370]  Where's the fourth one?
[02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:24.430]  Behind here?
[02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.490]  No.
[02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:27.250]  Behind here.
[02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:31.810]  He has a button to see through walls.
[02:06:32.110 --> 02:06:33.790]  Like, it's so crazy.
[02:06:34.450 --> 02:06:35.390]  One here, maybe?
[02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:39.670]  Man, if walls had chins.
[02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:42.310]  Banana.
[02:06:47.690 --> 02:06:49.830]  What's up, Sim? Thanks for the five gifted.
[02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:50.470]  Appreciate you.
[02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:51.750]  Thank you so much.
[02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:53.010]  Appreciate that.
[02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:54.770]  Still not popped the last balloon.
[02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:57.350]  Yeah, I'm looking for it.
[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.720]  It's not there, not there.
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:12.000]  He's going straight into the ceiling.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:16.520]  It is a balloon, they can float.
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:18.600]  This is the craziest, like,
[02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.180]  I just, man.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:22.540]  Braxerman, thank you, five gifted.
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:24.100]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:25.100]  And Wes the Rad.
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:27.220]  The rats are coming out.
[02:07:27.380 --> 02:07:28.440]  Is it outside?
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:29.820]  Hell yeah.
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:32.580]  No.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:34.820]  You can go through walls.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.360]  Don't, don't.
[02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:40.020]  I just don't know, it's not worth your time.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:45.000]  Like, it's truly not worth your time.
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:57.800]  Somewhere in here, I know you're in here.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:58.720]  Where are you hiding?
[02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:06.240]  What the fuck?
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:18.020]  This is like, it's just,
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.020]  it's kind of like watching
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:21.560]  an ape play this game.
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:23.660]  Like if a monkey was given a control.
[02:08:35.330 --> 02:08:37.590]  I can't believe you don't like this song, Eric.
[02:08:37.590 --> 02:08:39.530]  It just keeps going.
[02:08:39.730 --> 02:08:40.550]  It's making me nut.
[02:08:40.690 --> 02:08:41.970]  It's so long.
[02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:46.270]  Because this is the song that you have when you're in this mode
[02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:47.230]  and there's no time
[02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:49.250]  on this level for this mode.
[02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:50.290]  This is just a lot.
[02:08:52.630 --> 02:08:53.430]  Where's this balloon?
[02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:57.230]  Where's this balloon?
[02:08:57.630 --> 02:08:58.650]  I'm using the sonar.
[02:09:00.230 --> 02:09:01.330]  Are we down?
[02:09:02.730 --> 02:09:03.750]  It's showing it,
[02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:04.650]  like you can see it.
[02:09:04.650 --> 02:09:06.230]  It's so fucking crazy.
[02:09:06.530 --> 02:09:08.410]  It's so fucking crazy.
[02:09:08.590 --> 02:09:10.350]  Oh my god.
[02:09:11.230 --> 02:09:12.790]  Hey guys, August 1st
[02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:14.970]  at 1pm, the new Gerpler is coming out.
[02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.830]  Can't wait for that.
[02:09:16.190 --> 02:09:18.310]  Regulationsstore.com, regulationsstore.store.
[02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:20.770]  You can check out the video now.
[02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:22.910]  It's on our YouTube channel, all of our socials.
[02:09:23.090 --> 02:09:24.910]  It was made by Slow Mo Guys
[02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:25.850]  Gavin Free.
[02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:27.550]  You guys go check it out.
[02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:30.370]  Get the Gerpler. It's exciting.
[02:09:30.570 --> 02:09:32.430]  And Oh My Morgz with Five Gifted. Incredible.
[02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:34.470]  Gavin, anything you want to plug today?
[02:09:34.610 --> 02:09:36.530]  You got any appearances coming up on any
[02:09:36.530 --> 02:09:37.450]  morning shows or anything?
[02:09:39.130 --> 02:09:40.430]  No, just that
[02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:40.990]  old Gerpler.
[02:09:44.690 --> 02:09:46.430]  I threw two things
[02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.890]  this time.
[02:09:48.070 --> 02:09:48.750]  It looked great.
[02:09:52.190 --> 02:09:54.570]  There you go, a second banana.
[02:09:59.070 --> 02:10:00.470]  Just need one more balloon.
[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:02.550]  Yep, look for it.
[02:10:09.730 --> 02:10:10.930]  They have to come back tomorrow
[02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:11.890]  between 12 and 4.
[02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:14.790]  What? Oh no!
[02:10:15.590 --> 02:10:16.330]  Happy weekend.
[02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:17.470]  Yay.
[02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:19.670]  Oh my god, dude.
[02:10:20.590 --> 02:10:23.110]  Is Albert to blame? Is he on the ceiling chewing your cable?
[02:10:23.610 --> 02:10:24.910]  Oh yeah, was he chewing cables?
[02:10:25.890 --> 02:10:26.970]  He's not supposed to do that.
[02:10:31.330 --> 02:10:32.350]  Andrew's farming gold.
[02:10:35.050 --> 02:10:36.470]  Well, you guys can watch stuff here.
[02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:38.990]  Nick says you're allowed to
[02:10:40.290 --> 02:10:40.950]  watch it.
[02:10:41.190 --> 02:10:42.330]  Yeah, you can even go in
[02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:44.210]  me and Gavin's room.
[02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:46.730]  Wow, no way!
[02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:48.150]  Was it underground the whole time? That's so crazy.
[02:10:48.690 --> 02:10:49.570]  I was looking up.
[02:10:51.250 --> 02:10:52.910]  Yeah, you were looking up. It's true.
[02:10:55.150 --> 02:10:55.550]  Easy.
[02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:58.290]  You went around the wall that you couldn't find.
[02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.810]  Yeah.
[02:11:01.650 --> 02:11:02.210]  Yeah.
[02:11:03.690 --> 02:11:04.810]  Uh-huh.
[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:07.790]  There you go.
[02:11:11.670 --> 02:11:13.210]  Just not picking anything up.
[02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:15.470]  Can you do an
[02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:16.590]  upwards?
[02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:19.470]  Does the charge punch work upwards or just forward?
[02:11:19.930 --> 02:11:21.030]  No, I think it's just forward.
[02:11:21.370 --> 02:11:22.250]  Pretty sure it's just forward.
[02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:23.170]  Oh.
[02:11:25.290 --> 02:11:25.850]  Yeah.
[02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:26.650]  Cool deal.
[02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:30.370]  That was a good level.
[02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:35.390]  Let's see what's next
[02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:36.030]  at Kong World.
[02:11:37.590 --> 02:11:38.970]  Your bonanza was pretty sweet.
[02:11:39.070 --> 02:11:39.630]  I agree.
[02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:43.290]  He was like, that's the longest
[02:11:43.290 --> 02:11:44.490]  I've ever listened to that song.
[02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:47.330]  Man, I'm bummed
[02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:48.450]  about my internet.
[02:11:48.970 --> 02:11:49.890]  Dude, I'm bummed for you.
[02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:53.330]  It's like, what happens midstream
[02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:54.710]  on a sunny day?
[02:11:55.390 --> 02:11:55.870]  Right?
[02:11:59.830 --> 02:12:00.310]  Just...
[02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:02.170]  It could be that someone else was getting internet
[02:12:02.490 --> 02:12:04.330]  installed and they unplugged yours.
[02:12:04.970 --> 02:12:06.230]  Oh, I didn't even think about that.
[02:12:06.230 --> 02:12:08.770]  I don't know why that would take until tomorrow to fix.
[02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:10.310]  That's true.
[02:12:10.590 --> 02:12:11.310]  It's a different tool
[02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:13.290]  that they don't have, apparently.
[02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:16.650]  Also, Gavin,
[02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:18.630]  I found out
[02:12:18.630 --> 02:12:20.410]  my internet died. I was streaming
[02:12:20.410 --> 02:12:22.130]  Roadcraft this morning and my keyboard
[02:12:22.130 --> 02:12:23.850]  stopped working. And then
[02:12:23.850 --> 02:12:26.070]  I had to reboot my computer twice and
[02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:28.070]  unplug and re-plug my keyboard in twice
[02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:29.970]  to get it to work. And then when I got my keyboard to work
[02:12:29.970 --> 02:12:32.170]  I realized I had no internet. And then went down
[02:12:32.170 --> 02:12:34.190]  that saga. And then when I got mad and got
[02:12:34.190 --> 02:12:36.130]  into my car to come to work, my car play
[02:12:36.130 --> 02:12:36.710]  wasn't working.
[02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:39.850]  And it still isn't working. It just stopped.
[02:12:40.490 --> 02:12:42.150]  Was your house struck by lightning or something?
[02:12:43.130 --> 02:12:52.900]  Oh, this is good.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.960]  What are those little colored things called?
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:57.220]  Peekaboo?
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.420]  Or something like that?
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:12:59.320]  They're pretty cute.
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:02.740]  Peekabob? Peekaboo? Peekabob?
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:03.640]  Something like that.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:05.940]  There's a lot of them.
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:09.020]  I wish I had the spin move so I could kill them instantly.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:10.100]  Because it just takes forever.
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:12.820]  Yeah, but what about
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:13.360]  punching upwards?
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:16.420]  Is this the hot ape?
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.200]  Oh my god!
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:21.220]  Guys, watch this.
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.300]  Oh my god!
[02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:27.820]  Oh.
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:34.400]  See, I don't like that they speak a weird language.
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:38.500]  Good lord.
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:40.060]  What language do you think they should have spoken?
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.120]  I mean, they can all speak
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:45.160]  the same weird language if she spoke it
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:46.780]  also, but she speaks English.
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:47.300]  I see.
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:50.940]  That's my issue. If they're gonna do a weird
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:52.900]  Simlish language, then everyone should do it, right?
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:55.200]  But you got mad when she was singing
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.920]  in foreign. Maybe she was an exchange student.
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:59.240]  Right, because she speaks English the rest
[02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:01.100]  of the time. Singing
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:01.880]  in foreign?
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:05.080]  But who's she singing to?
[02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:06.680]  Oh yeah.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.120]  She knows her audience.
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:11.260]  Right, but I just think that they can all speak that
[02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:13.320]  language and that's fine, or all speak English and that's
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:15.140]  fine, or whatever language it is localized
[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:17.260]  to. I just think that it's weird
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:18.940]  as like a both ways thing.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.300]  They can also all understand her English.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.020]  I have an ooze!
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:34.600]  Oh no! Leap to our doom.
[02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:40.970]  Oh, there's so many skill points behind them.
[02:14:41.090 --> 02:14:41.870]  Is that a world drill?
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:51.980]  Oh, I hope
[02:14:51.980 --> 02:14:54.000]  you like getting uppercutted. This guy has like a
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.880]  real 80's kind of
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.880]  character design
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:14:58.880]  to him. I like it.
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:01.380]  I like all the new Kong designs.
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.980]  Why does he look like the dumb guy from the Ginyu Force?
[02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:19.500]  He looks intolerant to me.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:21.600]  Whoa!
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.020]  Got real Archie Bunker vibes.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:25.000]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.540]  Peek-a-Bruiser!
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:34.260]  Oh, you're in trouble, Peek-a-Bruiser.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:39.900]  Oh my god!
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:42.240]  Does a slide attack?
[02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.510]  I've
[02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:52.170]  done dishes with that.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:58.840]  Is this the thing
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:00.300]  where I gotta kill these guys and it hurts?
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:03.040]  Is that what you think?
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:05.040]  Oh, he's
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:05.420]  upside down.
[02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:06.800]  I see.
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:09.000]  I got it.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.300]  He swings, he becomes weak.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:14.640]  Finally a moment for you to punch up.
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.080]  Gavin's chuckle.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:24.880]  Now I
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:26.900]  can punch him in the eyes.
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:28.800]  And what is it
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:29.180]  that you're doing?
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:31.160]  I'm hitting him.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:36.280]  Gavin, you got any thoughts on this?
[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:37.700]  It's great.
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.580]  It's almost half dead.
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:42.400]  I like you added to him there a little bit. You gave him more
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:43.760]  more volume.
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:45.740]  He's got a little...
[02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:47.460]  You gave him just a little bit more.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:49.320]  Clearly doing something right, Andrew.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:51.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:53.700]  Less than half health.
[02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:01.110]  Nice.
[02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:03.570]  Get that.
[02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:08.150]  What have you done to him?
[02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.890]  Ow.
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:18.540]  You like, give it a new forehead.
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:26.200]  You ain't fooling me
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:27.520]  with this. Oh, shit.
[02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:29.460]  If this was a
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.060]  let's play, it'd be more parts of the gears.
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:37.100]  Oh, man.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:46.420]  He's almost
[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:46.720]  dead.
[02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.040]  So are you.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.640]  Oh, shit.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.520]  I am. Fuck.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:56.540]  Better eat some monkey fruit
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:57.000]  or something.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:58.700]  He's saving the
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:00.020]  bonanza for the final hit.
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:01.120]  Oh.
[02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:13.490]  I feel like this fight could be long over by now.
[02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.990]  Ah, yeah. Yes.
[02:18:15.170 --> 02:18:16.050]  When I played it, it was.
[02:18:17.670 --> 02:18:18.150]  What?
[02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:21.270]  It's wild that they gave you so many
[02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.710]  games.
[02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:27.870]  I agree.
[02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.250]  Luckily, you had an apple juice.
[02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:34.850]  Is there a new GURPLR on sale?
[02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:37.550]  August 1st. But we did debut the trailer
[02:18:37.550 --> 02:18:39.110]  that we actually commissioned
[02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.790]  Slow Mo Guys Gavin for you to do.
[02:18:41.350 --> 02:18:43.450]  Pretty cool. I don't usually
[02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:45.470]  use the word, but I'm gonna say
[02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:46.350]  it was a collab.
[02:18:47.250 --> 02:18:48.470]  Come on.
[02:18:49.170 --> 02:18:50.090]  Another great one.
[02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.850]  Got him.
[02:18:55.590 --> 02:18:56.890]  Got him. Guys,
[02:18:57.010 --> 02:18:57.450]  he got him.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:10.220]  Yeah, that's right. It's August 1st
[02:19:10.220 --> 02:19:12.280]  is Switzerland's national holiday.
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:13.600]  That's right.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.800]  That's why we're releasing it.
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:18.040]  You know our deep
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:19.660]  Switzerland ties.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:22.080]  The Swiss
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:23.540]  are some of our
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.180]  most regulation listeners, so we wanted to celebrate
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:26.600]  with them.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.180]  That's why we made it the color of the Swiss flag.
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:31.220]  Yep.
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:33.380]  Red and yellow.
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.260]  Check analytics and see if that's true.
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:39.520]  To the next layer.
[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:42.320]  Yeah, it's the same people
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:43.980]  that make the German army knife. That's right.
[02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:48.780]  Amazing innovation.
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.340]  Oh my god.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:53.400]  God damn.
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.220]  That lagoon vest
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:19:58.860]  is pretty sweet.
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:01.260]  That's for her.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:03.560]  It's still sweet.
[02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:06.280]  Yeah, no, I agree. I think that's the one that I have. I like it.
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.780]  Thanks, Grey Shadow Wolf.
[02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:13.260]  That's my first tie.
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:19.540]  Can I break this?
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:22.240]  Are we going to play any more Tony Hawk? I don't know. Are we going to play any more
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:22.620]  Tony Hawk?
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:25.580]  Nick says no.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:28.280]  Nick in the distance says no, but I mean, who
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.140]  knows. Gerpal Rain
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:31.160]  with the gifted sub thank you.
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.960]  Maybe we'll create some sort of a torment
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:36.140]  show with the wheel where Eric,
[02:20:36.140 --> 02:20:37.600]  if it lands on Eric, he has to play
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:39.780]  Blueprints, and if it lands on Tony Hawk,
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:40.880]  Nick has to play it.
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:43.680]  And then we'll identify three other games that
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:45.180]  the other three idiots don't like.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:51.860]  The world's
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:53.680]  changing too fast. He doesn't recognize
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:55.820]  things anymore. Things are different.
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:20:57.720]  This isn't how it was when I was a kid. He gets confused
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.800]  when he turns on the news.
[02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:02.580]  He doesn't understand...
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:03.980]  Maybe if we
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:06.740]  whistle, he'll feel better. I don't think so.
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:08.880]  Doesn't seem to impact him.
[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:10.680]  I think you should go back and explore
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.700]  before you jump down, but again, you
[02:21:13.260 --> 02:21:14.340]  have just done something.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:15.380]  That's fine, you did it.
[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:17.920]  Nothing wrong with that.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.060]  Hey, did you guys see that? Grey Shadow Wolf.
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.920]  I wanted to say thank you.
[02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:24.340]  He got married on July 10th, and he signed
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:26.620]  his marriage documents, or they signed their marriage documents
[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:27.800]  with a bean hole pin.
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:28.760]  That's cool.
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:30.900]  Very cool.
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:32.880]  I no longer own
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:34.780]  that yard, but you own more of my
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:35.500]  old house than I do.
[02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:38.260]  You didn't take a pen for yourself?
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.980]  I didn't.
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:41.640]  Isn't there one in the office?
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:43.160]  Yeah, probably.
[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:49.010]  Gavin, what
[02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.890]  video game do you hate?
[02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:53.130]  What game do I hate?
[02:21:53.310 --> 02:21:55.110]  Oh, definitely this. I would hate to
[02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:56.030]  play this on a video.
[02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:57.770]  Yeah, we're not going to fall for that.
[02:22:02.410 --> 02:22:03.170]  I hate...
[02:22:04.390 --> 02:22:04.770]  Limbo.
[02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:08.290]  I'm trying to think of stuff that Jack likes.
[02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:13.270]  I bet you would hate playing World of Warcraft
[02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:14.490]  for any amount of time.
[02:22:14.750 --> 02:22:17.450]  I mean, you made me play it once.
[02:22:18.010 --> 02:22:20.030]  I know, you were a little bitch
[02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:20.630]  about it.
[02:22:22.210 --> 02:22:23.130]  I hated you all.
[02:22:23.130 --> 02:22:23.470]  What was that?
[02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:26.910]  I had the funniest idea for a series.
[02:22:27.470 --> 02:22:28.870]  I got us all together
[02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:30.850]  and I made us all play World of Warcraft
[02:22:30.850 --> 02:22:33.230]  but we started new characters and we were all
[02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:35.150]  pandas and we were all priests.
[02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:37.070]  So it was five people
[02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:38.890]  called the Panda Priest Posse.
[02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:41.030]  And if you know anything about
[02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:43.090]  playing games like World of Warcraft, you're supposed to balance
[02:22:43.090 --> 02:22:45.270]  your team with different skills, but we didn't do that
[02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:46.690]  because we were all priests.
[02:22:47.070 --> 02:22:48.970]  So it made us extra useless
[02:22:48.970 --> 02:22:51.230]  and I thought it was the funniest thing
[02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.970]  ever.
[02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:55.130]  Getting Ray and Michael
[02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:57.510]  enthused about playing WoW was almost impossible.
[02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:59.350]  I give Gavin shit, but at least Gavin's
[02:22:59.350 --> 02:22:59.950]  a professional now.
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.920]  I love getting lumped
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:11.200]  into your anger about the other team.
[02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:15.040]  Some of my ideas back in the day
[02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:17.080]  were so much better than their ability
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:17.840]  to give a shit.
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:22.700]  Bring some of that over here, man.
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:24.360]  Yeah, dude, we'll do whatever. I don't care.
[02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:26.680]  Yeah, we're watching
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:28.440]  Andrew try to play this and he's just
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:30.800]  punching directly up, so I'm down for whatever, dude.
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:32.800]  It's 2025, I defer to Andrew.
[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:34.540]  He's a creative genius in
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:35.560]  this show.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.020]  Check it out, Andrew. This is where you can spend your money.
[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:39.580]  Oh, I can spend my
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:42.580]  gold. What do I want?
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.360]  I like a melon juice.
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.240]  Yeah? What's it do?
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:46.520]  I don't know.
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:46.880]  Okay.
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.300]  That seems useful.
[02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:57.260]  Oh my god.
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:23:59.240]  Well...
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:00.620]  Yeah, I mean, you're not using
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:02.100]  Sona, so I guess you do need this.
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.800]  Yeah, but he's also not using
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:06.620]  the map, so it doesn't matter. You know what I mean?
[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:10.160]  What does the banana do?
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.820]  Press from banandia melons.
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:14.940]  Activate a banana without a full banana.
[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:16.320]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:17.580]  I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:20.380]  You never do that, but yeah, absolutely. 100%, dude.
[02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:22.360]  Absolutely. You never fucking activate it when it's
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:23.420]  full anyway, so yeah, sure.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:26.140]  No room for more of those.
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:32.160]  You can upgrade your apple juice cupboard, though.
[02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:33.640]  I can?
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:36.500]  You want to hold another juice?
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:37.900]  Is that here, or is that somewhere else?
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:40.500]  It's on the...
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.080]  on the...
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.560]  the up
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.180]  menu.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:49.740]  I gotta do up here?
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:50.360]  Yeah.
[02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:53.760]  I'm saving for my punch, though.
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:55.140]  There you go.
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:57.620]  Gavin, Gavin, don't.
[02:24:57.880 --> 02:24:59.440]  Gavin, just don't. Just don't bother.
[02:25:01.220 --> 02:25:02.560]  It's a waste.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:04.000]  Truly, like, it's a waste of your time.
[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:07.400]  I don't like having to punch down.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.660]  I feel about life.
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:11.700]  That's how I feel about this game.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:14.240]  Should we do a series of game videos
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.900]  where you can only punch up?
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:17.840]  Like Tekken, you can only uppercut.
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.020]  That's another great idea I had
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:26.340]  back in the day that nobody wanted to follow through with.
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:27.460]  I made us play
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.360]  Borderlands,
[02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:32.040]  but you could only use melee.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:33.940]  It's fucking hilarious.
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:37.820]  Like our Rocket City gameplay, then.
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.920]  No guns in Borderlands?
[02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:43.060]  It's possible.
[02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:50.230]  He didn't want to do it, but he did it.
[02:25:50.290 --> 02:25:52.690]  He wasted an apple juice on that, but he did it.
[02:25:53.490 --> 02:25:54.870]  I used my apple juice?
[02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:55.810]  Yeah, you fucking died.
[02:25:55.970 --> 02:25:58.030]  Oh, I did? Shit.
[02:25:58.530 --> 02:26:00.410]  Well, you gotta go back and buy another apple juice.
[02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:01.050]  No, you don't.
[02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:03.630]  Well, yeah, he's gotta be sure.
[02:26:04.390 --> 02:26:06.750]  Yeah, I gotta make sure I always get an apple juice on me at all times.
[02:26:09.330 --> 02:26:10.450]  If I didn't have that apple juice,
[02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:11.430]  I would have just straight up died.
[02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:13.130]  Can I buy things from these shops, too?
[02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:16.630]  That's a pretty safe assumption.
[02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:19.250]  Do you have a favorite apple juice, Andrew?
[02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:20.590]  Oh, that's 12.
[02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:24.370]  You know, if I'm feeling fancy,
[02:26:24.490 --> 02:26:26.170]  some Martinelli's. It's always good.
[02:26:26.470 --> 02:26:27.350]  Ooh, Martinelli's.
[02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:28.770]  Pretty hard to beat.
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.840]  I think we're about to see a man buy
[02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:36.700]  a lot of bananas.
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:40.100]  Banana.
[02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:46.270]  Okay, we're just gonna see
[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:47.090]  him buy one. Never mind.
[02:26:47.530 --> 02:26:49.090]  I gotta get my apple juice.
[02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:49.990]  I stand by that.
[02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:52.530]  That's on me.
[02:26:53.310 --> 02:26:53.750]  100%.
[02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:55.350]  He's gotta go back.
[02:26:55.570 --> 02:26:58.670]  I haven't had one of those recently.
[02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:02.290]  Were you ever a juicy fruit guy?
[02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:03.910]  Yeah, when I was a kid.
[02:27:04.650 --> 02:27:05.570]  When there were less options.
[02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:13.670]  Another skill point.
[02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:15.810]  Upgrade that punch yet, or what?
[02:27:16.290 --> 02:27:17.470]  I need one more.
[02:27:21.430 --> 02:27:23.810]  He should be able to probably buy just enough
[02:27:23.810 --> 02:27:24.910]  here. I guess we'll see.
[02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:29.530]  I mean,
[02:27:30.810 --> 02:27:31.870]  I wish there was a
[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:33.750]  just take all of my stuff
[02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:35.890]  button. Just give me all the bananas
[02:27:35.890 --> 02:27:36.390]  you can.
[02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:39.990]  Eric, do you know what brand of onion rings we had?
[02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:43.730]  I wanna say it was like TGI
[02:27:43.730 --> 02:27:44.930]  Fridays or something. I think you're right.
[02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:47.630]  I knew good
[02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:49.650]  potato skins. Was that it?
[02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:50.630]  You didn't buy any more?
[02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:53.390]  I couldn't buy any more. Oh, did he say I'm out of bananas?
[02:27:53.930 --> 02:27:55.310]  Yeah, no, he said you're out of
[02:27:55.310 --> 02:27:57.510]  money. The price goes up.
[02:27:57.610 --> 02:27:58.710]  I needed more banana coin.
[02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:06.110]  Andrew's waiting for banana coin
[02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:07.330]  to boom. Yeah.
[02:28:07.850 --> 02:28:10.230]  I'm about to rug pull it, so don't count on it.
[02:28:10.970 --> 02:28:11.930]  Banana hands over here.
[02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.770]  Where are you going?
[02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:21.850]  I'm cutting the cage off.
[02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:23.110]  I'm cutting the cage off.
[02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.430]  Okay.
[02:28:27.090 --> 02:28:28.130]  Okay. It looks like you're
[02:28:28.130 --> 02:28:30.050]  running around in brownie.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:38.600]  Oh, that's what I needed.
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:40.280]  No!
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:45.060]  If only there was a way to grab things without actually
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:46.160]  having to physically run into them.
[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:49.300]  That'd be cool. Until they patch
[02:28:49.300 --> 02:28:50.480]  this game, I just don't think they can.
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.320]  Oh, there's chests everywhere.
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:55.440]  Man, that tie's really working hard.
[02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:08.270]  Oh!
[02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:10.210]  Awesome.
[02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.570]  Okay.
[02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:14.330]  I got what I needed.
[02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.590]  Great.
[02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.510]  Banana!
[02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:29.430]  So how many of those
[02:29:29.430 --> 02:29:30.570]  can you buy in this store?
[02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:32.690]  I guess unlimited?
[02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:34.990]  I just bought one and pissed off.
[02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:36.790]  Me too, and then he like, he upped the price
[02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:38.250]  and I went, ah, I'll just collect more, it's fine.
[02:29:40.170 --> 02:29:40.910]  I'll play
[02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:42.670]  the game. Yeah, right.
[02:29:43.570 --> 02:29:44.790]  I'm factoring in interest
[02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:45.550]  I want to get in now.
[02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:51.560]  Okay.
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:54.160]  Oh, cool.
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:57.040]  That's a thing.
[02:30:04.650 --> 02:30:05.650]  I'm gonna get some more
[02:30:05.650 --> 02:30:06.750]  bananas in here.
[02:30:08.490 --> 02:30:08.890]  Yep.
[02:30:10.450 --> 02:30:10.930]  Yep.
[02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:12.790]  Shifty platform road.
[02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:15.930]  Are we shifting?
[02:30:20.530 --> 02:30:21.670]  Wow, he's locked in.
[02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:24.130]  We're seeing a different Andrew.
[02:30:31.250 --> 02:30:32.410]  I said it, not you.
[02:30:32.650 --> 02:30:33.490]  You said it, not me.
[02:30:35.570 --> 02:30:37.030]  You said it, not you.
[02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.210]  What?
[02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:39.270]  What?
[02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:48.790]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[02:30:48.810 --> 02:30:50.510]  I just need one more. Oh, shit.
[02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:52.090]  Fuck.
[02:30:52.490 --> 02:30:53.790]  That was so good.
[02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:55.570]  Oh, holy shit.
[02:30:56.330 --> 02:30:57.490]  Oh my god.
[02:30:58.550 --> 02:31:00.170]  I'm like losing my mind.
[02:31:00.250 --> 02:31:01.550]  That was so fucking funny.
[02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:05.210]  He's locked in.
[02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:08.330]  I felt different, folks.
[02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:14.530]  Oh, man.
[02:31:15.970 --> 02:31:16.390]  Oh.
[02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:24.050]  Hell yeah, skill point.
[02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:26.450]  Hell yeah, it's time to get that punch.
[02:31:27.730 --> 02:31:28.470]  Locked in.
[02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:30.130]  Walks right off the ledge.
[02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:33.450]  I feel absolutely insane.
[02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:35.070]  Oh, Christ.
[02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:36.570]  Hey, where's the banana?
[02:31:36.570 --> 02:31:38.350]  Gavin, any thoughts on the gameplay here?
[02:31:38.530 --> 02:31:39.150]  Where's the banana?
[02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:42.390]  I just can't believe...
[02:31:42.390 --> 02:31:44.250]  Considering how much you were looking forward to the game,
[02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:46.510]  I can't believe you're doing a bit the whole thing.
[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:47.190]  Yep.
[02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:49.150]  I'm really enjoying it.
[02:31:51.850 --> 02:31:52.850]  I'm having a great time.
[02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:55.170]  I can't wait to play this
[02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:57.230]  as soon as he ends
[02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:59.310]  so I can rinse this
[02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:00.770]  out of my fucking brain forever
[02:32:00.770 --> 02:32:03.650]  and play it the nice, normal way.
[02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:05.330]  As somebody who
[02:32:05.330 --> 02:32:07.390]  doesn't play these games and hasn't seen
[02:32:07.390 --> 02:32:09.010]  the previous iterations, this is...
[02:32:09.010 --> 02:32:10.530]  I just think this is how it's played.
[02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.970]  Yeah, no.
[02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:14.030]  Oh, my...
[02:32:16.350 --> 02:32:17.390]  You think
[02:32:17.390 --> 02:32:18.750]  this is how it's played?
[02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:20.470]  Yeah, this is all I know.
[02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.790]  He missed.
[02:32:28.640 --> 02:32:29.160]  Okay.
[02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:32.220]  Okay.
[02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:39.440]  Oh! Climb, climb, climb!
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:40.220]  He did it.
[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:47.260]  I can't imagine
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.540]  this is how this is played.
[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:52.880]  Your tone sure shifted.
[02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:54.320]  Here we go.
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:56.620]  Is this...
[02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:58.780]  Is this back the way you came there?
[02:32:59.480 --> 02:33:00.040]  Yeah.
[02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:01.000]  Okay.
[02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:03.620]  Okay.
[02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:06.060]  I see you trying to be sneaky
[02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:06.620]  over there.
[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:10.840]  Okay.
[02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:15.780]  Gotcha. I gotcha.
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:16.440]  I gotcha.
[02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:19.700]  I don't think I found that one.
[02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:21.920]  Speaking of idiot
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:23.660]  flags in the chat, don't forget
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:25.080]  you can buy those in our store.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:26.060]  Yeah, no kidding.
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:28.360]  regulationstore.com
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:31.220]  Wave it high for Andrew.
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:31.960]  Yeah.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:35.340]  I've got a lot.
[02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:37.100]  The goof world election
[02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:39.120]  is coming up. I need to lock in my votes.
[02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:41.400]  Need to secure my second
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:43.400]  term as mayor of goof world.
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:45.420]  Yeah, I don't think there's going to be much competition,
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:48.060]  man. I think people are just going to watch this and go...
[02:33:48.060 --> 02:33:49.580]  Andrew's running unopposed.
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:51.320]  Yeah. That's my mayor.
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:55.100]  That three minutes
[02:33:55.100 --> 02:33:56.180]  felt like an eternity.
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:33:58.980]  That was three minutes? Yes.
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:00.020]  That went by quick.
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:02.120]  That was three minutes.
[02:34:02.620 --> 02:34:04.280]  It was 4.49 because I went,
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:06.520]  this is probably the last thing that he does
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:07.680]  and we'll take it out at 5.01.
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:09.720]  And then I looked and it was 4.52.
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:12.100]  And it felt like I aged a year.
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:13.100]  Yeah.
[02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:22.640]  What are you going to have for dinner, Gavin?
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:26.960]  Maybe a steak.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:28.860]  Are you going to go out for dinner
[02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:30.440]  with people or are you going to eat by yourself?
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:32.760]  I've been invited for a meal.
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:34.140]  Oh, wow.
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:36.640]  If you're going to get invited to a meal, you've got to have steak.
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:40.060]  A delicious steak meal?
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:42.940]  That's lucky.
[02:34:44.140 --> 02:34:44.860]  What are you thinking
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:45.900]  about for sides?
[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:48.360]  Great question.
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:49.220]  Well,
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:52.700]  it's probably so many people
[02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:55.020]  at a meal that there'll be, like, table sides.
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:55.740]  Yeah.
[02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:00.780]  And just before we get to those sides,
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:02.960]  Shittison Kane with the five gifted subs.
[02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:03.900]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:06.660]  Your true Shittison of the world.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.060]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:17.120]  Am I thinking hot dog? I don't know.
[02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:19.160]  Oh, you're going to go
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:19.840]  for a hot dog tonight?
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:23.160]  Get some final numbers in?
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:25.080]  I gotta go pick
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:26.000]  the dog up.
[02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.100]  And replace my wife who has to
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:30.140]  go record her podcast.
[02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:32.920]  Go pick the dog up from
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:33.600]  doggy daycare.
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:35.820]  Replace your wife?
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:38.940]  I have to go home with the dog
[02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:40.240]  so she can go do the podcast.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.160]  And you call that replacing your wife?
[02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:44.800]  Maybe you should say relieve your wife.
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:47.240]  Well, I was referring to
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:48.880]  like with the AT&T guy.
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:50.560]  Right.
[02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:52.000]  But he's gone I think.
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:00.720]  Anyway, I have to replace my wife.
[02:36:05.220 --> 02:36:06.560]  Not like I'm going to get rid of her
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.280]  and get a new wife.
[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:10.540]  But I have to replace her presence in the house
[02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.100]  with my presence.
[02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:12.780]  Better.
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:18.100]  Listen, I'm not the one that sucks at Donkey Kong here.
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:18.420]  Yeah.
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:20.760]  Sucks at Donkey Kong?
[02:36:23.620 --> 02:36:26.360]  I can't hear you due to the fact I'm punch level 4.
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:35.540]  I want to know how many people
[02:36:36.020 --> 02:36:37.000]  God no.
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:39.280]  I want to know how many people
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:42.000]  were going to buy this game and then
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.280]  watched this. And they're watching this and going this does not look fun.
[02:36:44.380 --> 02:36:45.220]  This looks fucking weird.
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:46.700]  It's so much fun.
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:48.240]  Let me be clear, this is great.
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:51.000]  I know, I've played it.
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:52.820]  It's way better than what you're seeing here guys.
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:55.700]  Like how many pre-orders got cancelled today?
[02:36:57.820 --> 02:36:59.280]  Purple stuff so strange.
[02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:00.460]  Banana mine.
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.820]  Oh, my friend Brian is raiding. That's nice.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:06.460]  We're going to wrap up here, but thank you guys.
[02:37:06.540 --> 02:37:08.420]  Go follow King Lord Brian. Thank you very much.
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:09.300]  Thank you Brian.
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:12.960]  Brian came out here and we went to a
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:14.760]  wrestling show out in Arlington.
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:16.680]  Oh, cool.
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.020]  It was a lot of fun. We saw a guy
[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:21.180]  get clothes lined onto a bed of nails.
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:22.060]  It was pretty exciting.
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.960]  Now, is the hmm because you're trying to
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:29.640]  solve the puzzle?
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:30.940]  Yes.
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:32.360]  Just making sure.
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:37.140]  You gotta say.
[02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:37.320]  Okay.
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.720]  Yeah, give me the
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:45.720]  smashing stats.
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:51.180]  I think I'm going to have pizza for dinner.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.480]  I've been so good all week.
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:54.880]  I cooked every night.
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:56.560]  My wife and I cooked all night.
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:58.520]  I'll get a...
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:01.520]  I've been really into Jets pizza lately.
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:03.080]  Oh, I still haven't been.
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:04.360]  Yeah, they're very good.
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.500]  They're really good things.
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:07.980]  They have good pizza.
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:10.580]  I think I'm more into them than Via313 now.
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:12.040]  Dude, you know where I just went
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:14.280]  and they started doing that kind of pizza
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.540]  is Eastside Pies.
[02:38:15.940 --> 02:38:18.540]  I went to the new Eastside Pies location
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:20.820]  on Burnit and they have a
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:22.880]  thick crust
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:24.900]  like a Via313 Detroit style pizza
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:26.760]  but it almost
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:27.800]  tastes like sourdough.
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:30.420]  I really enjoyed it.
[02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.240]  I really recommend it.
[02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:34.460]  I went to that one right after they
[02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:36.400]  opened and it wasn't fully finished
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.080]  inside. No, it's nice.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:40.260]  I tried to go to Pint House
[02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:42.460]  and it was way too crowded.
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:43.900]  Pint House gets better.
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:45.280]  That's a good ass pizza.
[02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:48.360]  But anyway, I'll probably order a Supreme
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:49.000]  from Jets.
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:51.460]  Sounds good.
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:56.340]  Says the guy who
[02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:58.380]  was shit-talking Supreme pizzas.
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:00.320]  That's just one of their options
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:00.800]  at a party.
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:04.600]  It's an option.
[02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:05.420]  I've never forgotten it.
[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:07.220]  I haven't either.
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:10.260]  One friend used to host
[02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:12.300]  a lot of things and he would always get
[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:14.680]  multiple Supremes and everybody else
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:16.380]  would just eat the freaking pepperoni.
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:18.560]  Supreme's so good.
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:20.340]  It's fine.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.360]  Can't go wrong with a Supreme.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:24.580]  I was going to say that I'm really jet-lagged.
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.620]  I just flew a lot and then I flew somewhere else
[02:39:26.620 --> 02:39:28.700]  and then last night I was like
[02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:30.780]  I'm going to go to bed early and get a lot of sleep.
[02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:32.540]  And I couldn't sleep because of the jet-lag
[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:34.700]  and then some real
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:36.860]  funny bastard who was in this hotel
[02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:38.620]  room before me set a 5am
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:39.840]  alarm on the floor.
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:44.720]  That's a new fun game.
[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:45.860]  Andrew, that spikes.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:47.900]  He's fine, he's got it.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:50.300]  He's just as apple-juicier, don't worry.
[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:51.960]  Oh no.
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:54.260]  Wow, who would have seen that coming? That's crazy.
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:56.440]  I've never died in this game.
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:57.700]  No, me neither.
[02:39:58.460 --> 02:39:58.900]  Costly.
[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:00.620]  I'm going to retry.
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.800]  Hey, he's going to give it a retry, guys.
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:04.840]  Let's evaluate.
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:06.420]  So I need to surf, clearly.
[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:10.900]  Yep.
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:13.900]  Okay, so that breaks it.
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:17.720]  So Gavin,
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:19.480]  you're in like that, when we were in Vegas
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:20.280]  mental time.
[02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:24.020]  Big time.
[02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:26.020]  You know
[02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:28.060]  guys, I was telling Andrew
[02:40:28.060 --> 02:40:30.020]  the other day, I drove home from
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:31.760]  Michigan a couple days ago, right?
[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:33.480]  I was
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:36.020]  only about 2 hours, I was 3 hours away
[02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:38.100]  from Deputy. I thought briefly about
[02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:40.040]  rolling out there.
[02:40:40.580 --> 02:40:42.020]  But that's a 6 hour
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:42.520]  detour.
[02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:49.200]  That would have been a funny
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:51.160]  detail there.
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:52.240]  Yeah.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.100]  It's one of those detours that I probably would have done
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:40:57.060]  on the way out, but on the way home, I was ready
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:58.000]  to get home.
[02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:00.760]  Isn't that always true of a road trip?
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:03.040]  I also, in one of our
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:04.960]  upcoming podcasts, I was telling the story
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:07.120]  about driving home. I talked shit about
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:09.380]  Little Rock and
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:11.100]  Texarkana. I said
[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:12.080]  they were dogshit towns.
[02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:15.180]  I was thinking about it after that, and I don't think
[02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:16.880]  that that was fair on those towns, so I issued
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.820]  an official retraction on Solalright.
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:19.680]  Oh, nice.
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:22.720]  I think Little Rock had some issues, but
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:24.700]  I was very unfair to Texarkana.
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:26.760]  I get it. That's nice of you to
[02:41:27.380 --> 02:41:27.820]  reconsider.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.820]  When you realize you're wrong,
[02:41:30.940 --> 02:41:32.520]  you gotta own up to it. Yeah.
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:34.920]  Have we had any regulation
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:36.780]  listeners head out to
[02:41:36.780 --> 02:41:39.000]  Deputy? I don't think so.
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:40.600]  I'm not sure. Maybe.
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:42.920]  We just haven't seen it. None that'll admit
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:44.760]  to it. Yeah, you don't want to
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:45.300]  admit it.
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:50.540]  He's
[02:41:50.540 --> 02:41:51.980]  doing it. Come on, come on, come on.
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:53.920]  Killing it.
[02:41:58.100 --> 02:41:59.340]  There we go.
[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:04.000]  Didn't jump.
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.060]  Such a good spot to jump.
[02:42:08.300 --> 02:42:08.780]  No!
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.420]  5-0-1, the best time of the week,
[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:14.360]  ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:17.120]  Welcome to a hell of our own creation.
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:19.540]  It's 5-0-1 in Andrew.
[02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:21.560]  He's truly struggling in
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:23.720]  Donkey Kong. Hope everyone's
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:25.680]  having a great time as we roll
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:27.500]  right into the
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:30.040]  weekend. We got this...
[02:42:33.550 --> 02:42:34.330]  He's not even
[02:42:34.330 --> 02:42:35.490]  going to make it to the fucking thorns.
[02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:42.930]  5-0-1.
[02:42:43.690 --> 02:42:44.390]  The best time
[02:42:44.390 --> 02:42:45.370]  of the week is...
[02:42:45.370 --> 02:42:48.650]  This is the run.
[02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:50.410]  This is the run here.
[02:42:50.410 --> 02:42:52.770]  As we've been told, this is the run.
[02:42:53.650 --> 02:42:54.110]  Money run.
[02:42:54.450 --> 02:42:57.090]  I cannot wait to play this game.
[02:42:57.210 --> 02:42:58.090]  Bought a pro controller.
[02:42:58.370 --> 02:43:00.310]  Cannot wait to play this game with the pro controller.
[02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:02.650]  I wish this game had permadeath.
[02:43:05.490 --> 02:43:06.590]  Real like Dark Souls
[02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:07.730]  style Donkey Kong game.
[02:43:09.530 --> 02:43:10.410]  Donkey Souls.
[02:43:13.330 --> 02:43:14.490]  He did it.
[02:43:14.570 --> 02:43:16.110]  Folks, he's all the way...
[02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:17.650]  He's going back for that one.
[02:43:18.810 --> 02:43:19.630]  This one.
[02:43:20.770 --> 02:43:21.650]  Pretty good.
[02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:27.070]  And he's done it!
[02:43:27.570 --> 02:43:28.950]  Surfing in style.
[02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:30.590]  No!
[02:43:32.730 --> 02:43:33.550]  You can exit.
[02:43:35.930 --> 02:43:37.130]  This is
[02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:38.830]  hell on earth.
[02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:41.690]  We did it! We got one
[02:43:41.690 --> 02:43:43.330]  banana. Way to go.
[02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:45.550]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:47.190]  This has been our Donkey Kong
[02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:49.090]  Banana Bonanza. What was the name of it, Andrew?
[02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:50.790]  Dale Kong's DK
[02:43:51.370 --> 02:43:52.550]  Extravaganza Banana Bonanza.
[02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:55.050]  There you have it, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:57.050]  We'll see you next time.
[02:43:57.130 --> 02:43:57.790]  Check out the Patreon.
[02:43:59.130 --> 02:44:00.790]  Check out the gameplay channel on YouTube
[02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:02.590]  where you can watch this later if you're a psychopath.
[02:44:03.270 --> 02:44:05.510]  You can also watch Nick play Tony Hawk.
[02:44:05.850 --> 02:44:07.510]  Look, there's so much stuff we're putting out for you guys.
[02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:09.430]  You gotta check it out, but always listen to the podcast
[02:44:09.430 --> 02:44:11.770]  and let a friend know about this show.
[02:44:13.010 --> 02:44:13.870]  Gavin, thank you for
[02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:15.550]  joining us late. That was a lot of fun.
[02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:17.830]  Geoff, Andrew,
[02:44:18.130 --> 02:44:19.990]  Nick, thank you guys so much for being here.
[02:44:20.430 --> 02:44:22.010]  Any final thoughts from you boys
[02:44:22.010 --> 02:44:22.730]  before we wrap it up?
[02:44:22.890 --> 02:44:25.250]  I think Donkey Kong wants to say something.
[02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:27.470]  Check out the
[02:44:28.050 --> 02:44:28.510]  Patreon.
[02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:31.990]  The regulation
[02:44:32.470 --> 02:44:32.930]  pod.
[02:44:33.270 --> 02:44:35.950]  He wants to say something else, too. Check it out.
[02:44:36.090 --> 02:44:37.770]  He's in a slightly different voice. He's gonna
[02:44:37.770 --> 02:44:39.510]  say, uh, New
[02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:42.190]  Cosmic Gerpler, August 1st.
[02:44:45.630 --> 02:44:46.470]  You ever
[02:44:46.470 --> 02:44:48.770]  wonder why we're here?
[02:44:52.890 --> 02:44:54.430]  Gavin, anything else?
[02:44:55.450 --> 02:44:56.270]  Nothing to add.
[02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:57.590]  There you have it.
[02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:59.910]  Alright, boys. Thank you very much.
[02:45:00.010 --> 02:45:01.890]  Thanks for watching, guys. We'll see you later. Bye!
[02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:02.450]  Bye!
