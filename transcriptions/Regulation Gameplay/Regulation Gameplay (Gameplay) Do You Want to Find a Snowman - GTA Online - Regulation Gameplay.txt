[00:00.000 --> 00:02.340]  Holy shit. What the hell did my thing do?
[00:02.820 --> 00:03.720]  Could it...
[00:03.720 --> 00:05.260]  Is anyone seeing this?
[00:05.500 --> 00:06.020]  No, what's wrong?
[00:06.140 --> 00:06.980]  It looks fine.
[00:07.200 --> 00:07.460]  Yeah.
[00:07.980 --> 00:08.540]  What's it doing?
[00:09.940 --> 00:12.580]  Oh, do you mean the snow in Los Santos? Yeah, that's weird.
[00:13.060 --> 00:13.500]  Um...
[00:13.500 --> 00:13.820]  Hey!
[00:15.260 --> 00:15.700]  Shit!
[00:16.060 --> 00:19.380]  Oh my god. I didn't see that coming at all.
[00:19.660 --> 00:21.740]  I did. I got a great view of it coming.
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.680]  That was awesome.
[00:25.640 --> 00:27.980]  I can't believe you guys are just still up there.
[00:28.100 --> 00:29.440]  Well yeah, you died. We're fine.
[00:30.000 --> 00:30.700]  Yeah, I got fucked up.
[00:30.700 --> 00:32.040]  This is a military helicopter, dude.
[00:32.480 --> 00:32.680]  Yeah.
[00:32.820 --> 00:33.800]  Oh, I need to get picked up.
[00:34.040 --> 00:35.720]  I think my Mac just crashed.
[00:36.180 --> 00:38.160]  What? Oh, that ain't good. Oh, there's my crash.
[00:38.680 --> 00:40.700]  Andrew hit you so hard it crashed your computer.
[00:42.020 --> 00:43.760]  That was cross-nations, that did.
[00:46.060 --> 00:48.840]  Okay, my capture screen is off. My Mac screen came back on.
[00:49.060 --> 00:49.420]  Okay.
[00:49.620 --> 00:50.580]  We've gone for a reboot.
[00:50.880 --> 00:51.460]  Is that good?
[00:52.320 --> 00:53.980]  Well, I can't see the game anymore.
[00:54.760 --> 00:57.040]  Is that why we're going so high?
[00:57.680 --> 01:00.280]  Look, there's less stuff to crash into at the top of the sky.
[01:00.420 --> 01:01.440]  Start going forward.
[01:02.420 --> 01:03.340]  Not in New Jersey.
[01:03.580 --> 01:04.380]  There you go. There you go.
[01:04.600 --> 01:06.040]  Keep going forward. You're good.
[01:06.280 --> 01:06.360]  Okay.
[01:08.240 --> 01:10.360]  Hang a right for two seconds.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.000]  One, two. Perfect. Keep going straight.
[01:14.040 --> 01:15.720]  Good. You want to go down a little bit?
[01:16.840 --> 01:17.260]  Okay.
[01:17.600 --> 01:19.660]  And then a little bit more right for two seconds.
[01:20.860 --> 01:22.460]  One, two. Right there. Okay.
[01:22.780 --> 01:24.680]  Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
[01:25.200 --> 01:25.800]  Still going down?
[01:25.800 --> 01:27.800]  No, no, no. Start going up. Up, up, up.
[01:27.840 --> 01:28.240]  Go up!
[01:29.160 --> 01:29.600]  Okay.
[01:34.660 --> 01:37.080]  I've started a one-on-one death match with Gavin.
[01:37.840 --> 01:40.540]  Paying a $7,000 bounty on Geoff has been claimed by Gavin.
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.060]  Oh, sick.
[01:42.140 --> 01:42.420]  Nice.
[01:42.940 --> 01:44.520]  I did that with basically my eyes closed.
[01:47.280 --> 01:47.720]  Ow.
[01:48.160 --> 01:48.500]  Go.
[01:50.080 --> 01:50.520]  Go.
[01:52.100 --> 01:52.540]  Go.
[01:53.720 --> 01:54.160]  Ow.
[01:54.160 --> 01:55.020]  Go!
[01:55.740 --> 01:57.460]  I'm in a mom car.
[01:58.900 --> 02:00.480]  I'm in like a fucking Kia.
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.420]  It's funny you guys are so far away from the scene.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.860]  Is that how far he drifted?
[02:04.960 --> 02:05.220]  Yeah.
[02:05.720 --> 02:06.420]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07.120 --> 02:08.780]  Did I have bad instructions?
[02:10.100 --> 02:10.360]  What?
[02:10.700 --> 02:13.180]  Eric was trying to drive you through two buildings.
[02:13.280 --> 02:13.940]  Yeah, I wanted...
[02:13.940 --> 02:14.900]  And it was going well.
[02:15.340 --> 02:18.220]  I think you just kept going down.
[02:18.800 --> 02:19.940]  You just kept going down.
[02:19.940 --> 02:24.220]  You went down into a building that wasn't even a part of the whole scenario.
[02:24.400 --> 02:24.660]  Yes.
[02:25.300 --> 02:28.940]  You said go down, and then I kept going down, but you never said to go back up.
[02:29.120 --> 02:30.820]  Oh, we said it a lot all at once.
[02:30.980 --> 02:34.220]  Yeah, it felt like I was saying it a bunch of times.
[02:35.100 --> 02:38.120]  Much louder than all of the other instructions I had been giving.
[02:39.880 --> 02:41.120]  All right, let's stop dicking around.
[02:41.800 --> 02:42.200]  Yeah.
[02:42.380 --> 02:43.820]  Yeah, guys, it's time to get serious.
[02:43.960 --> 02:44.840]  This is Grand Theft Auto.
[02:46.760 --> 02:47.160]  Oh!
[02:47.640 --> 02:48.660]  Oh, my God!
[02:48.860 --> 02:49.500]  Sorry, Andrew.
[02:49.500 --> 02:50.180]  Sorry, Andrew, I saw you there.
[02:51.440 --> 02:51.760]  Okay.
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.040]  I mean, I didn't see you there.
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.180]  Or did I see you?
[02:55.240 --> 02:55.840]  Who can tell?
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.060]  Who can say?
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.400]  Who can never be sure?
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.420]  I can't get you out of my tires.
[03:01.740 --> 03:02.800]  All right, where are we meeting?
[03:03.680 --> 03:04.800]  We're at the casino.
[03:05.600 --> 03:05.620]  We're waiting.
[03:05.660 --> 03:06.080]  Geoff and I are here.
[03:06.200 --> 03:06.800]  We're just hanging out.
[03:07.200 --> 03:07.940]  Oh, you're all separated.
[03:08.080 --> 03:08.560]  I'm nice to you, Matt.
[03:09.200 --> 03:09.480]  Really?
[03:09.500 --> 03:10.340]  Someone's off on their own.
[03:11.080 --> 03:11.940]  Eric's pissed off.
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.540]  What was that?
[03:14.320 --> 03:15.580]  It's because I blew up, you know?
[03:15.780 --> 03:17.060]  What did you do to me, Andrew?
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.000]  Nothing, I don't know.
[03:19.000 --> 03:20.640]  I don't know that tool.
[03:20.780 --> 03:21.180]  What is that?
[03:21.180 --> 03:23.800]  Oh, no, he's real mad about it.
[03:24.040 --> 03:24.960]  They're real mad.
[03:25.360 --> 03:26.380]  Get away.
[03:26.980 --> 03:28.540]  Andrew zapped me somehow.
[03:28.600 --> 03:29.160]  Get away.
[03:29.740 --> 03:29.960]  Cool.
[03:31.280 --> 03:34.920]  Oh, no, all the casino staff are real upset with me.
[03:36.720 --> 03:38.640]  I don't want a wanted level.
[03:39.520 --> 03:40.720]  Everybody chill out.
[03:40.960 --> 03:41.900]  Everybody chill out.
[03:42.140 --> 03:43.560]  Who are you talking to?
[03:44.100 --> 03:45.360]  The NPCs.
[03:45.540 --> 03:47.700]  Oh, he punched me.
[03:48.060 --> 03:48.320]  Okay.
[03:48.320 --> 03:49.500]  I didn't want this.
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.780]  You brought this on yourselves.
[03:50.940 --> 03:51.500]  Oh, now they're running.
[03:51.720 --> 03:52.360]  Now they're fucking scared.
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.240]  I threw one punch.
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.160]  Get out of here.
[03:54.220 --> 03:56.460]  I love that the fucking valet is just watching the whole thing go down.
[03:56.540 --> 03:56.940]  Doesn't care.
[03:57.080 --> 03:57.720]  He's just hanging out.
[03:57.860 --> 03:58.720]  He's like, all right, I'll see you guys later.
[03:59.560 --> 04:00.480]  My shift's over.
[04:00.580 --> 04:01.460]  I'm not fucking, I'm done.
[04:01.880 --> 04:03.620]  I'm so happy to collect something different.
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.880]  I've been collecting Archies in Call of Duty all week.
[04:05.960 --> 04:06.980]  Now I get to collect a snowman.
[04:08.340 --> 04:09.320]  Collect the Knicks kid?
[04:09.680 --> 04:09.860]  Yeah.
[04:10.420 --> 04:13.480]  I had to get like 400 of them to unlock everything on the advent calendar.
[04:14.780 --> 04:15.140]  Advent?
[04:15.900 --> 04:16.620]  Advent calendar?
[04:17.700 --> 04:18.620]  Finished it this morning.
[04:19.820 --> 04:21.040]  Sorry, I'm trying to run.
[04:21.140 --> 04:22.620]  I'm trying to get away from the cops.
[04:23.860 --> 04:25.180]  I looked away.
[04:27.480 --> 04:30.260]  Can I like hit a button to make like the cops go away or what?
[04:30.860 --> 04:32.120]  Yeah, there is.
[04:32.180 --> 04:32.880]  Oh, God.
[04:32.920 --> 04:33.620]  Did you trip?
[04:33.980 --> 04:34.160]  What happened?
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.800]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[04:35.840 --> 04:36.940]  Did you trip?
[04:37.720 --> 04:39.220]  I had my menu up.
[04:39.280 --> 04:40.900]  I just sort of like sloughed down.
[04:41.000 --> 04:41.600]  Oh, I see.
[04:41.680 --> 04:42.240]  The bugger.
[04:42.960 --> 04:43.760]  You fuck.
[04:43.760 --> 04:44.080]  I see.
[04:44.180 --> 04:45.180]  You fuck, Geoff.
[04:45.180 --> 04:46.400]  Why me?
[04:46.580 --> 04:47.120]  Why am I a fuck?
[04:47.140 --> 04:47.700]  I'm just laughing.
[04:48.020 --> 04:49.180]  Because it sent you.
[04:49.260 --> 04:51.000]  I killed him and it sent you.
[04:52.600 --> 04:55.120]  It black and white.
[04:55.740 --> 04:57.340]  It black and white.
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.160]  Hey, this worked for Geoff.
[05:01.460 --> 05:03.480]  Oh, so that's what that's like to witness?
[05:03.700 --> 05:04.220]  That's great.
[05:05.180 --> 05:05.300]  Jump.
[05:07.180 --> 05:08.780]  Yeah, it's always been so much fun.
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.840]  How do you do that?
[05:12.360 --> 05:13.280]  Like I'm telling you.
[05:13.420 --> 05:14.880]  How do you do that?
[05:15.660 --> 05:16.660]  Do I have that ability?
[05:17.220 --> 05:18.620]  No, you haven't unlocked it in the game yet.
[05:18.700 --> 05:20.020]  I'm the only one that can do it.
[05:21.540 --> 05:22.400]  Don't even try.
[05:23.320 --> 05:26.760]  It's actually part of his contract when he did voice work for Red Dead 2.
[05:26.800 --> 05:27.080]  Yeah.
[05:27.240 --> 05:29.760]  It's a really cool, exclusive thing.
[05:30.440 --> 05:31.680]  Oh, I got a challenge complete.
[05:31.840 --> 05:33.000]  Call a mugger on another player.
[05:33.200 --> 05:33.860]  Oh, he did it.
[05:34.260 --> 05:34.980]  That's great.
[05:35.500 --> 05:35.660]  Hit.
[05:36.360 --> 05:37.220]  He figured it out.
[05:38.000 --> 05:38.840]  Oh, that's so fun.
[05:39.000 --> 05:39.460]  Are you still trying to lose cops, Eric?
[05:39.620 --> 05:41.120]  Yeah, I'm still trying to lose the cops.
[05:41.140 --> 05:42.180]  He's finding me and then not.
[05:42.920 --> 05:43.600]  Just let him kill you.
[05:45.180 --> 05:46.580]  No, I just lost him.
[05:46.580 --> 05:47.100]  Oh, nice.
[05:47.240 --> 05:47.420]  Yeah.
[05:47.620 --> 05:48.340]  Get over.
[05:48.740 --> 05:49.240]  Well, OK.
[05:50.080 --> 05:50.600]  Simian.
[05:51.060 --> 05:52.300]  Oh, no you don't.
[05:52.820 --> 05:54.800]  Geoff was mugged for $10,000.
[05:55.320 --> 05:55.340]  Let me up!
[05:55.340 --> 05:55.900]  Let me up!
[05:56.940 --> 05:58.580]  You little son of a bitch.
[05:58.820 --> 05:59.160]  No!
[05:59.720 --> 06:00.480]  What is that?
[06:00.860 --> 06:02.160]  Stop electrocuting me.
[06:04.860 --> 06:05.740]  He's running.
[06:06.100 --> 06:07.100]  He's getting away.
[06:07.580 --> 06:08.580]  No, don't shoot him.
[06:08.600 --> 06:11.460]  I've got to reclaim the last 18 years of Let's Play.
[06:13.500 --> 06:14.820]  He's still moving.
[06:15.180 --> 06:15.940]  Stop.
[06:16.920 --> 06:17.560]  Leave me alone.
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.360]  Go, mugger, go.
[06:19.880 --> 06:20.820]  Go, be free.
[06:21.660 --> 06:22.280]  Be free.
[06:22.800 --> 06:23.940]  Fucking asshole.
[06:24.520 --> 06:25.440]  He was mugged.
[06:26.920 --> 06:29.040]  Whoa, I just got $10,000.
[06:30.000 --> 06:30.620]  Holy shit.
[06:31.300 --> 06:32.180]  You got the money.
[06:32.600 --> 06:33.980]  I need that mugging money.
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.200]  I'm going to make you all back.
[06:35.500 --> 06:35.640]  OK.
[06:39.480 --> 06:41.180]  That was brutal.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.260]  Absolutely brutal.
[06:44.260 --> 06:45.740]  Call it even after that.
[06:45.900 --> 06:48.340]  I was trying to throw snowballs and have fun.
[06:48.560 --> 06:49.280]  Now I'm...
[06:49.280 --> 06:49.720]  Oh, God.
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.160]  I'm in the middle of the racetrack.
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.020]  How do I get out of here?
[06:53.460 --> 06:55.440]  Why don't we just start on the racetrack?
[06:56.220 --> 06:57.780]  Because I know how to get out.
[06:58.160 --> 07:00.200]  It's so annoying to come from the racetrack.
[07:00.520 --> 07:00.980]  I don't know.
[07:01.460 --> 07:02.540]  Where am I supposed to go?
[07:02.980 --> 07:04.340]  Let's start at the racetrack.
[07:04.960 --> 07:09.960]  I assume I first got mugged in 2013 and then I just called my first mugger in 2024.
[07:13.420 --> 07:14.560]  2025, almost.
[07:15.100 --> 07:16.040]  Everything is closed.
[07:16.500 --> 07:16.860]  That's...
[07:16.860 --> 07:18.040]  I'm trying...
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.700]  Eric, all of your instincts are wrong.
[07:19.920 --> 07:22.520]  You're going further from...
[07:22.520 --> 07:23.320]  I found a car.
[07:23.460 --> 07:24.180]  You're in the middle of it.
[07:24.200 --> 07:25.000]  Yeah, I found a car.
[07:25.660 --> 07:26.800]  OK, well, we'll group up here.
[07:27.120 --> 07:27.820]  Get out of the car.
[07:27.920 --> 07:28.600]  We'll just start here.
[07:28.760 --> 07:28.940]  OK.
[07:29.640 --> 07:30.240]  We'll run out.
[07:30.260 --> 07:31.000]  We'll start by the palm tree.
[07:31.920 --> 07:32.260]  Yeah.
[07:32.740 --> 07:34.460]  Like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world.
[07:36.260 --> 07:36.460]  How?
[07:38.160 --> 07:39.520]  Like this palm tree has two...
[07:39.520 --> 07:40.320]  has two balls.
[07:40.520 --> 07:41.940]  It's like a big...
[07:42.140 --> 07:43.480]  I've never noticed that before.
[07:44.200 --> 07:45.240]  You don't have observation.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.300]  Ow.
[07:49.980 --> 07:50.420]  No.
[07:51.040 --> 07:53.340]  Yeah, we'll meet by the anatomically correct tree.
[07:54.860 --> 07:55.680]  Geoff, get out of the water.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.320]  What?
[07:57.440 --> 07:58.540]  What is that?
[08:00.680 --> 08:02.460]  Is that something y'all got from a heist?
[08:02.800 --> 08:03.520]  What is that?
[08:03.560 --> 08:05.000]  No, are you not around for the upper dam, Isaac?
[08:05.160 --> 08:06.180]  You've got this, surely.
[08:06.960 --> 08:07.760]  I don't think so.
[08:08.080 --> 08:08.680]  It's a pistol.
[08:09.220 --> 08:09.540]  What?
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.860]  Oh shit, with a snowball?
[08:10.860 --> 08:12.020]  You killed him with a snowball?
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.960]  You died from a snowball?
[08:14.540 --> 08:15.300]  You suck.
[08:16.120 --> 08:16.740]  Thanks.
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.440]  As soon as you get over here, Geoff will start.
[08:21.900 --> 08:22.300]  Will he?
[08:23.040 --> 08:23.300]  Yup.
[08:24.380 --> 08:25.000]  Nice.
[08:25.380 --> 08:25.540]  Action roll.
[08:27.460 --> 08:29.020]  Oh, he's dodging.
[08:29.420 --> 08:29.840]  Rebuttal.
[08:30.260 --> 08:30.900]  Oh god.
[08:31.380 --> 08:31.800]  Oh shit.
[08:31.900 --> 08:33.380]  Stop killing each other.
[08:33.860 --> 08:35.340]  He's the one tossing balls.
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.880]  Guess what, Gavin?
[08:39.200 --> 08:40.600]  I guess I do have the honor.
[08:40.860 --> 08:44.080]  I guess I was around.
[08:44.500 --> 08:46.700]  Yeah, this was about eight years ago, I think.
[08:48.820 --> 08:51.040]  I'm getting in the car of safety, so I can't be killed.
[08:55.580 --> 08:56.720]  That doesn't look it up.
[08:56.900 --> 08:59.180]  No, you son of a bitch, Geoff!
[09:00.980 --> 09:02.940]  Not fair that we have a car there to start the round.
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.500]  You know what? Good point.
[09:05.280 --> 09:05.780]  I like it.
[09:06.080 --> 09:07.160]  Alright, Eric's here. Where's Gavin?
[09:08.900 --> 09:10.440]  I got blown up by a car.
[09:11.460 --> 09:11.960]  Oh, really?
[09:11.960 --> 09:12.440]  Yeah.
[09:12.860 --> 09:14.020]  I wonder where this video started.
[09:14.600 --> 09:15.200]  Right here.
[09:15.960 --> 09:16.900]  Probably in the helicopter.
[09:17.400 --> 09:17.840]  Does that look good?
[09:19.800 --> 09:22.300]  Yeah, the helicopter plane crash was pretty awesome.
[09:22.860 --> 09:24.260]  Just get over here. What are you doing?
[09:24.880 --> 09:26.480]  I'm just making sure no one's tossing balls.
[09:28.840 --> 09:29.680]  You're antagonizing.
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.360]  You're asking for a ball throw.
[09:32.540 --> 09:33.920]  Look, I got nothing in my hands. My hands are fine.
[09:34.240 --> 09:35.740]  Oh no! Oh no!
[09:35.740 --> 09:37.000]  Get in the water.
[09:38.360 --> 09:39.860]  We are here. We're all grouped up.
[09:39.940 --> 09:43.800]  We are going to try to collect the 25 snowmen as part of the winter event.
[09:44.260 --> 09:45.880]  First person to collect all 25 wins.
[09:46.220 --> 09:49.180]  We can't attack each other, but we cannot take aerial vehicles.
[09:49.660 --> 09:51.320]  We all have a map to follow.
[09:52.160 --> 09:52.860]  Any questions?
[09:53.180 --> 09:56.400]  Yeah, where did you get the smallest map in the world?
[09:56.640 --> 09:57.320]  What is this?
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.960]  I googled a collectible map and I found the first one and I posted it and nobody complained.
[10:02.220 --> 10:03.200]  And you stopped there.
[10:03.200 --> 10:05.720]  Yeah, because we weren't playing at the time.
[10:06.140 --> 10:08.600]  Also, you posted it like on Christmas Eve.
[10:09.240 --> 10:10.180]  Well, that's your problem.
[10:10.840 --> 10:12.400]  At 10.30 PM.
[10:14.260 --> 10:14.780]  You're a problem.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.440]  You had all of Christmas Day.
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.280]  We're racing each other.
[10:18.380 --> 10:22.300]  We're racing each other. First one to get all 25 snowmen wins.
[10:22.620 --> 10:24.040]  No aerial vehicles allowed.
[10:24.740 --> 10:28.280]  Can we make a rule right now that we have to use this map and only this map?
[10:29.180 --> 10:30.220]  Nobody else wants to google it?
[10:30.320 --> 10:30.780]  That's a good rule.
[10:30.940 --> 10:31.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:31.940 --> 10:32.920]  And that's what it is.
[10:33.020 --> 10:36.560]  What if we hijack an aerial vehicle that just happens to come down near us?
[10:36.780 --> 10:42.000]  No aerial vehicles. Unless one of the snowmen are on a rooftop and you have to.
[10:42.460 --> 10:50.000]  So no personal vehicles, no aerial vehicles unless it's required to get the snowmen.
[10:50.380 --> 10:53.040]  Do you know if there's any that require you to get on a...
[10:53.040 --> 10:56.060]  No clue. I didn't want to look at them because I figured that could be an advantage.
[10:56.260 --> 10:57.260]  Can I ask one more question?
[10:57.880 --> 10:58.260]  Of course.
[10:58.660 --> 11:00.340]  Do you know how big the snowmen are?
[11:00.340 --> 11:02.320]  No clue. No idea.
[11:02.600 --> 11:02.960]  Okay.
[11:03.140 --> 11:04.900]  Are we ready to go?
[11:05.180 --> 11:05.280]  Yeah.
[11:05.660 --> 11:07.040]  What's the rules on killing and all that?
[11:07.420 --> 11:08.960]  Oh, you kill? Yeah, do whatever you want.
[11:09.060 --> 11:09.740]  Oh, I gotta go.
[11:11.620 --> 11:13.320]  I gotta go. I gotta go.
[11:13.620 --> 11:15.660]  Well, we've all got B together, then we'll do a 3, 2, 1.
[11:15.700 --> 11:16.460]  Oh, no!
[11:18.760 --> 11:18.980]  Okay.
[11:19.860 --> 11:20.220]  Okay.
[11:20.780 --> 11:22.900]  Oh, wait, where is Eric?
[11:23.040 --> 11:23.380]  You ready?
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.100]  I'm right here.
[11:24.300 --> 11:25.100]  Yeah, we're all here.
[11:25.400 --> 11:26.420]  A snowball launcher?
[11:27.040 --> 11:27.260]  Yeah.
[11:27.420 --> 11:27.660]  Oh!
[11:28.160 --> 11:28.820]  Okay, are we ready?
[11:28.820 --> 11:29.360]  Yeah.
[11:31.020 --> 11:34.420]  3, 2, 1, go.
[11:35.040 --> 11:35.560]  Go!
[11:37.120 --> 11:37.480]  Run!
[11:38.020 --> 11:38.220]  Run!
[11:44.410 --> 11:44.930]  Oh!
[11:45.130 --> 11:45.970]  Piece of shit!
[11:47.950 --> 11:49.210]  I'll see y'all later.
[11:49.610 --> 11:49.910]  Shit!
[11:49.910 --> 11:52.450]  The snowball launcher's the best gun in the game. Oh, my God.
[11:53.250 --> 11:54.450]  Did you unlock that recently?
[11:55.170 --> 11:56.690]  No, I just had it in my pocket somehow.
[11:57.810 --> 12:00.990]  I think you get it for free for playing during this update.
[12:01.050 --> 12:01.430]  Oh, okay.
[12:01.430 --> 12:02.330]  Yeah, I played.
[12:02.470 --> 12:03.030]  I'm playing.
[12:03.490 --> 12:04.210]  Oh, I played.
[12:04.470 --> 12:05.150]  Oh, I played.
[12:05.710 --> 12:07.190]  Oh, this game?
[12:07.530 --> 12:08.450]  Oh, I played.
[12:08.990 --> 12:09.330]  I played.
[12:10.110 --> 12:11.170]  Oh, I played.
[12:11.450 --> 12:13.370]  Why did that take me so long to get up from?
[12:17.850 --> 12:18.250]  Ow.
[12:18.330 --> 12:21.110]  I feel like it'll be such a big advantage once you find the first one.
[12:21.190 --> 12:24.550]  I don't know how to... dude, this map.
[12:24.790 --> 12:25.190]  Oh, God.
[12:26.170 --> 12:27.230]  I'm so clustered.
[12:27.350 --> 12:28.770]  This map is, like, illegible.
[12:30.330 --> 12:31.130]  It's pretty...
[12:31.130 --> 12:33.250]  Place the marker down where I think the first one is.
[12:33.970 --> 12:35.670]  Yeah, I think I'm in the right area.
[12:36.050 --> 12:36.450]  Ballpark.
[12:37.370 --> 12:37.810]  Park ball.
[12:39.710 --> 12:39.990]  Okay.
[12:40.310 --> 12:41.350]  Oh, my God.
[12:41.970 --> 12:42.570]  Well, I'm dead.
[12:44.630 --> 12:47.770]  You bounced off the hood in a very great way.
[12:47.890 --> 12:48.930]  That'll teach me to look at the map.
[12:49.110 --> 12:49.510]  Okay.
[12:50.270 --> 12:50.890]  You swooped.
[12:53.370 --> 12:54.290]  It's gotta be.
[12:56.230 --> 12:58.430]  What if it takes us a whole video to find the first one?
[12:58.430 --> 12:59.110]  Yeah, right?
[12:59.470 --> 13:02.670]  I'm nervous that nobody else is going the way I'm going.
[13:03.630 --> 13:05.370]  What am I supposed to do?
[13:05.710 --> 13:06.150]  Like...
[13:06.150 --> 13:07.130]  I guess, what am I...
[13:07.130 --> 13:08.930]  God, I don't even know what the fuck I'm looking for.
[13:10.350 --> 13:10.790]  Snowman.
[13:11.230 --> 13:11.570]  Yeah.
[13:14.710 --> 13:15.890]  Get away from me.
[13:15.910 --> 13:16.170]  Oh, is that one?
[13:16.510 --> 13:17.590]  Oh, it's a cone.
[13:18.210 --> 13:19.070]  I hear...
[13:19.070 --> 13:20.890]  I hear...
[13:20.890 --> 13:21.650]  Bells.
[13:23.190 --> 13:23.990]  Oh, that's a good sign.
[13:24.030 --> 13:25.290]  Like sleigh bells.
[13:27.390 --> 13:28.090]  Yeah, I do too.
[13:28.090 --> 13:28.710]  Oh, there it is.
[13:28.910 --> 13:30.150]  Oh, I see one.
[13:30.270 --> 13:30.550]  Okay.
[13:31.090 --> 13:32.830]  Okay, so you hear bells when you're close.
[13:32.990 --> 13:33.850]  Yeah, so what do I do?
[13:33.910 --> 13:34.710]  Do I destroy it?
[13:34.750 --> 13:35.870]  You heard bells before.
[13:36.150 --> 13:36.590]  I did.
[13:37.050 --> 13:38.130]  Do I destroy it?
[13:38.890 --> 13:39.790]  What do I do?
[13:40.390 --> 13:40.670]  Andrew!
[13:41.310 --> 13:42.030]  I don't know.
[13:42.190 --> 13:42.870]  I don't know what to do.
[13:44.330 --> 13:44.870]  Let's see.
[13:45.190 --> 13:46.490]  I'm gonna try taking a photo of it.
[13:46.510 --> 13:48.290]  Oh, I got hit by a fucking pedestrian.
[13:48.290 --> 13:48.990]  And I died.
[13:49.810 --> 13:50.610]  Oh, that was...
[13:50.610 --> 13:52.050]  That was so realistic.
[13:52.390 --> 13:52.530]  Did you see that?
[13:52.530 --> 13:53.250]  Is it taking photos?
[13:53.730 --> 13:54.010]  Yeah.
[13:56.030 --> 13:57.510]  Did you just kick it in the nuts?
[13:57.590 --> 13:58.230]  What do you do with it?
[13:58.470 --> 13:59.610]  Well, we're trying to figure out.
[14:03.470 --> 14:05.030]  I took a photo.
[14:05.310 --> 14:06.410]  Nothing happened.
[14:06.890 --> 14:07.750]  I just saw a dog.
[14:09.170 --> 14:10.550]  I'm gonna take a selfie with it.
[14:10.870 --> 14:11.130]  Yeah?
[14:11.130 --> 14:12.430]  I gotta look the other way.
[14:12.970 --> 14:14.170]  Can I just lamp it?
[14:14.970 --> 14:16.510]  Oh, for Christ's sake!
[14:16.690 --> 14:16.910]  Yeah.
[14:19.130 --> 14:21.090]  Truce until we figure out what to do here, guys.
[14:21.230 --> 14:22.090]  I think I know.
[14:22.190 --> 14:23.310]  Let me take a stab at it.
[14:23.590 --> 14:24.270]  Hang on, Geoff!
[14:24.270 --> 14:24.590]  Look out!
[14:26.130 --> 14:26.890]  Saved your life.
[14:27.490 --> 14:28.310]  Oh, thank you.
[14:28.970 --> 14:29.950]  I can't figure...
[14:29.950 --> 14:30.450]  Geoff, I don't know.
[14:30.530 --> 14:30.890]  Thoughts?
[14:31.350 --> 14:31.830]  I'm looking.
[14:31.970 --> 14:32.210]  I'm looking.
[14:32.290 --> 14:32.550]  Hold on.
[14:32.890 --> 14:33.570]  Why am I pointing?
[14:34.870 --> 14:35.670]  What's happening?
[14:37.510 --> 14:38.290]  Why am I...
[14:38.290 --> 14:38.730]  Okay.
[14:38.990 --> 14:40.210]  It wouldn't stop pointing.
[14:41.770 --> 14:42.570]  I got...
[14:42.570 --> 14:43.730]  Are we supposed to, like...
[14:43.730 --> 14:44.890]  Can you hit it with a snowball?
[14:45.170 --> 14:45.450]  Hang on.
[14:45.530 --> 14:45.850]  Let's see.
[14:46.310 --> 14:46.930]  Don't hit me.
[14:47.890 --> 14:49.070]  How do you pick up a ball?
[14:49.370 --> 14:50.690]  Hit left on the D-pad?
[14:51.430 --> 14:51.810]  Oh!
[14:53.230 --> 14:55.190]  I hit it with a snowball and it got destroyed.
[14:56.650 --> 14:56.930]  Oh.
[14:56.930 --> 14:58.530]  So it says I have one of 25.
[14:59.330 --> 14:59.610]  Oh.
[15:00.150 --> 15:00.970]  Good call, Eric.
[15:01.050 --> 15:01.870]  So, I don't know.
[15:01.990 --> 15:02.450]  Collecting snow.
[15:02.590 --> 15:05.050]  I shot it with a snowball launcher and it didn't do anything.
[15:05.470 --> 15:05.670]  Alright.
[15:06.250 --> 15:08.070]  I've hit it with a few snowballs and it's not doing anything.
[15:08.150 --> 15:09.350]  I just hit it with two and it destroyed.
[15:09.350 --> 15:09.590]  Ah, there you go.
[15:09.710 --> 15:10.650]  One of 25 destroyed.
[15:10.830 --> 15:11.130]  Oh, okay.
[15:11.990 --> 15:12.270]  Awesome.
[15:12.530 --> 15:12.730]  Sweet.
[15:13.830 --> 15:14.610]  Where's the other guy?
[15:14.850 --> 15:15.510]  I'll see you guys later.
[15:16.590 --> 15:16.930]  Oh, shit.
[15:16.930 --> 15:17.650]  Someone has a wanted level.
[15:17.950 --> 15:18.550]  Yeah, it's me.
[15:18.930 --> 15:19.190]  Yeah, it's...
[15:19.190 --> 15:19.910]  Oh, it's me.
[15:21.050 --> 15:21.730]  Oh, yeah.
[15:22.890 --> 15:26.330]  You're kind of making all the cars drive in reverse real fast.
[15:27.990 --> 15:28.510]  Stop.
[15:32.670 --> 15:33.710]  Bless someone.
[15:34.070 --> 15:34.790]  Thank me.
[15:34.870 --> 15:35.210]  I'm someone.
[15:37.750 --> 15:38.130]  Uh-oh.
[15:38.510 --> 15:38.950]  I'm people.
[15:39.550 --> 15:40.210]  It's the fuzz.
[15:41.070 --> 15:41.970]  Alright, next up.
[15:42.170 --> 15:42.810]  Let's go see.
[15:43.930 --> 15:44.950]  I can't be arsed.
[15:45.130 --> 15:45.790]  I'm a cool Lester.
[15:45.790 --> 15:46.890]  Someone has a wanted level.
[15:48.710 --> 15:49.530]  Oh, truck.
[15:50.170 --> 15:53.850]  I'm heading in the direction I think it is.
[15:58.120 --> 16:02.040]  The fact that it does the jingle bell thing real nice.
[16:02.180 --> 16:02.440]  Yeah, it helps.
[16:02.680 --> 16:03.380]  Makes it so much easier.
[16:03.840 --> 16:04.640]  Definitely helps.
[16:07.180 --> 16:08.380]  So, do we all have one?
[16:08.540 --> 16:09.220]  I have one, yeah.
[16:09.360 --> 16:10.080]  I have one, yeah.
[16:12.300 --> 16:13.660]  God, this map is shit.
[16:13.660 --> 16:13.740]  Oh!
[16:16.960 --> 16:17.840]  Jesus Christ.
[16:19.900 --> 16:23.000]  Oh, I'm just drifting all over the place in the snow.
[16:23.380 --> 16:24.740]  Where, where, where?
[16:26.840 --> 16:29.060]  It's gotta be, it's gotta be around here, right?
[16:29.640 --> 16:29.940]  Yeah.
[16:30.540 --> 16:31.980]  I think everybody's...
[16:31.980 --> 16:34.620]  Like, we're all on kind of like the same page here.
[16:34.700 --> 16:35.500]  ...converging in the same place again, yeah.
[16:36.100 --> 16:36.820]  Maybe it's down here.
[16:38.240 --> 16:39.280]  I don't hear anything.
[16:39.900 --> 16:40.080]  Oh!
[16:41.240 --> 16:42.080]  How do I get down there?
[16:42.080 --> 16:42.640]  I hear something.
[16:46.420 --> 16:48.140]  In someone's backyard?
[16:48.620 --> 16:49.500]  I think so.
[16:52.020 --> 16:52.640]  Hey, cat.
[16:55.220 --> 16:56.180]  You see a kitty cat?
[16:56.620 --> 16:57.180]  I saw a cat.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.960]  I saw, I saw a delicious cat.
[17:02.680 --> 17:03.120]  Delicious?
[17:04.140 --> 17:04.520]  Yeah, what?
[17:05.740 --> 17:07.180]  I'm a classic elf.
[17:07.800 --> 17:10.060]  The thing about, I'm like the elf of this group, dude.
[17:11.660 --> 17:16.280]  This lady's taking a picture of this house for sale, but she's wearing a fucking tank top. It's very cold outside.
[17:17.460 --> 17:19.220]  Good god damn, where's this snowman?
[17:19.980 --> 17:21.440]  Oh, there it is.
[17:22.620 --> 17:24.580]  I did, I was doing the exact same thing.
[17:24.840 --> 17:26.740]  I was going, what the fuck? Oh, never mind.
[17:32.810 --> 17:35.570]  So, do I get money for destroying these, or what's the, uh...
[17:35.570 --> 17:36.110]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:36.230 --> 17:36.650]  Oh, cool.
[17:37.770 --> 17:39.770]  Oh god, this is the worst car. Fuck.
[17:39.770 --> 17:42.170]  It just stole a box truck.
[17:42.910 --> 17:43.850]  Like, this isn't...
[17:45.170 --> 17:47.030]  This is not ideal for getting around.
[17:47.810 --> 17:48.450]  Oh, boy.
[17:48.610 --> 17:49.550]  Is anyone on three yet?
[17:50.410 --> 17:51.670]  No, I'm still on one.
[17:51.890 --> 17:54.230]  I'm on my third right now, trying to...
[17:54.230 --> 17:54.730]  I got five.
[17:54.730 --> 17:55.350]  Trying to get to it.
[17:56.670 --> 17:57.730]  You've got five now?
[17:58.150 --> 17:59.590]  Nah, I got two.
[18:00.790 --> 18:01.890]  I wish I had five.
[18:03.130 --> 18:04.350]  That's your Christmas wish?
[18:04.790 --> 18:06.830]  This map is really fucking me.
[18:06.830 --> 18:09.770]  That would just be really impressive, and I think everyone would think I was cool if I had five.
[18:09.930 --> 18:10.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:10.810 --> 18:14.710]  We were sitting around the other day going, god, if Gavin had five, he would be so cool.
[18:14.790 --> 18:15.550]  We would...
[18:16.370 --> 18:17.950]  We would talk about him different.
[18:18.370 --> 18:19.410]  We'd be so nice to him.
[18:21.070 --> 18:22.910]  I said, I remember saying this.
[18:23.010 --> 18:24.830]  I said, you know, I think I'd finally respect him.
[18:27.030 --> 18:31.950]  Dude, Gavin started sending me fucking voice memos again.
[18:32.290 --> 18:34.510]  And it is the thing that makes my...
[18:34.510 --> 18:35.750]  My wife loves it.
[18:35.750 --> 18:42.090]  She thinks it's so funny when Gavin sends me the most banal voice memos.
[18:42.430 --> 18:43.410]  She loves it.
[18:45.730 --> 18:47.130]  Oh, Gav, I meant to tell you.
[18:47.230 --> 18:49.130]  I went to my cousin's Christmas party.
[18:49.430 --> 18:49.930]  Christopher, you know?
[18:50.390 --> 18:52.030]  And I was talking to some of his buddies.
[18:54.010 --> 18:58.630]  And they wanted to let me know that there are a lot of gay men that were really unhappy when you got married.
[18:59.270 --> 18:59.970]  Oh, that's the same.
[19:01.670 --> 19:02.470]  So, there you go.
[19:04.630 --> 19:07.330]  How does it feel, Gavin, to make a bunch of gay men unhappy?
[19:10.190 --> 19:11.310]  That's on you, bro.
[19:17.210 --> 19:19.610]  So, Eric already took off.
[19:19.610 --> 19:21.430]  So, he probably found the third one already, right?
[19:21.570 --> 19:22.550]  I have three now, yeah.
[19:22.890 --> 19:23.610]  Son of a bitch.
[19:23.670 --> 19:24.310]  I see a rabbit.
[19:24.690 --> 19:25.370]  A Christmas bunny.
[19:25.670 --> 19:26.390]  I'm a rat.
[19:27.070 --> 19:29.370]  I fucking can't find this thing.
[19:29.570 --> 19:30.810]  Jesus Christ.
[19:31.650 --> 19:32.770]  You sent a...
[19:32.770 --> 19:34.630]  This is the worst map, by the way.
[19:34.650 --> 19:36.010]  It's the worst map of all time.
[19:36.110 --> 19:38.270]  Like, this is impossible, Andrew.
[19:38.270 --> 19:39.690]  It's so low-res that it's like...
[19:40.510 --> 19:42.170]  It's the size of, like, two blocks.
[19:42.970 --> 19:44.130]  The icon could be anywhere.
[19:45.150 --> 19:45.950]  Gavin said...
[19:46.810 --> 19:47.510]  Go for it.
[19:48.030 --> 19:48.890]  I'm just gonna say...
[19:48.890 --> 19:49.670]  Nah, nothing. Go for it.
[19:50.910 --> 19:53.230]  Gavin looked at it before we started and said,
[19:53.290 --> 19:56.110]  Can we get a map that looks like it's not on a Game Boy?
[19:56.290 --> 19:58.070]  And that's exactly what this looks like.
[19:58.150 --> 19:58.850]  It looks like...
[19:59.330 --> 20:00.850]  It is so small.
[20:01.670 --> 20:02.850]  It is so low-res.
[20:03.170 --> 20:03.950]  It's insane.
[20:04.870 --> 20:05.190]  I have...
[20:05.190 --> 20:05.470]  I'm on two.
[20:05.570 --> 20:07.050]  Who put a bounty on me?
[20:07.430 --> 20:08.130]  You jerks.
[20:08.490 --> 20:09.350]  You say you're on two?
[20:10.530 --> 20:11.330]  Yeah, I got two.
[20:11.510 --> 20:12.450]  Well, I got two.
[20:13.630 --> 20:14.390]  Not I'm on two.
[20:14.630 --> 20:15.310]  There aren't two here.
[20:15.390 --> 20:17.070]  Wait, I'm so far away from where I should...
[20:17.070 --> 20:17.930]  Wait, where...
[20:17.930 --> 20:18.430]  What the...
[20:18.430 --> 20:18.950]  What am I doing?
[20:19.870 --> 20:20.910]  That's part of this.
[20:21.590 --> 20:22.950]  I can't even...
[20:22.950 --> 20:24.570]  I don't even know if I'm in the right...
[20:24.570 --> 20:25.210]  Ah, I suck.
[20:26.070 --> 20:26.670]  You okay, dude?
[20:27.270 --> 20:28.150]  You don't suck.
[20:28.150 --> 20:30.650]  It's just hard with this goddamn map.
[20:30.810 --> 20:31.910]  This map is awful.
[20:32.270 --> 20:34.330]  Which is maybe the point of it, right?
[20:34.670 --> 20:34.850]  Yeah.
[20:34.910 --> 20:35.650]  It was too easy.
[20:35.650 --> 20:36.590]  I think it definitely adds.
[20:38.250 --> 20:41.390]  I keep having to get new vehicles because where I park my car...
[20:41.390 --> 20:44.890]  ...thinking this domain is near is nowhere near where I actually need to go.
[20:45.230 --> 20:46.550]  Oh, goddammit.
[20:47.150 --> 20:48.510]  I'm never gonna find three.
[20:51.370 --> 20:52.290]  Eric found three.
[20:52.570 --> 20:52.950]  I know.
[20:53.530 --> 20:54.270]  Boys, I'm on four.
[20:54.610 --> 20:55.670]  He's got rat senses.
[20:55.670 --> 20:56.190]  I don't have that.
[20:56.190 --> 20:56.370]  Oh, shit.
[20:56.370 --> 20:57.190]  He's on four?
[21:00.210 --> 21:01.170]  Anyone's cooler than four?
[21:01.410 --> 21:01.690]  What's that?
[21:02.410 --> 21:02.750]  Five?
[21:04.330 --> 21:04.990]  Are you on five?
[21:05.790 --> 21:06.150]  No.
[21:06.390 --> 21:06.670]  Okay.
[21:06.990 --> 21:07.470]  I'm on two.
[21:07.870 --> 21:08.850]  But I am a cool guy.
[21:09.130 --> 21:10.790]  Imagine how revered he would be.
[21:11.210 --> 21:12.550]  Did you ever get the third one, Gavin?
[21:13.350 --> 21:13.710]  No.
[21:14.550 --> 21:16.810]  Well, I am getting it right now if you want to look at where I am in the map.
[21:17.010 --> 21:18.090]  Oh, shit.
[21:18.990 --> 21:21.750]  Geoff, in the spirit of competition and...
[21:22.430 --> 21:22.790]  Here.
[21:23.490 --> 21:24.010]  This is where I am.
[21:25.010 --> 21:25.990]  I love that.
[21:26.070 --> 21:26.910]  You had an idea.
[21:27.130 --> 21:27.930]  Fuck it.
[21:28.710 --> 21:29.350]  Thanks, Geoff.
[21:29.970 --> 21:30.650]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[21:31.250 --> 21:31.790]  Oh, god.
[21:32.170 --> 21:33.190]  That was a nasty prank.
[21:33.290 --> 21:35.230]  The jingle bells really helps.
[21:35.490 --> 21:36.530]  Oh, I ran right past this.
[21:36.610 --> 21:37.930]  I'm a silly bugger.
[21:38.150 --> 21:39.570]  Dude, I did the same thing.
[21:42.390 --> 21:48.550]  The jingle bells do not help when you are, I think, being chased by the cops and the jingle bells stop.
[21:49.090 --> 21:51.390]  Does it always take three snowballs or am I just an idiot?
[21:52.090 --> 21:53.230]  No, I think it is three.
[21:53.230 --> 21:53.950]  I think it is three.
[21:56.950 --> 21:58.750]  Why are the cops still on me?
[21:58.790 --> 21:59.470]  Get off me.
[22:00.390 --> 22:01.710]  Or get me off.
[22:01.870 --> 22:02.290]  Ho, ho, ho.
[22:02.410 --> 22:02.930]  Jingle bells stop.
[22:03.870 --> 22:04.450]  Okay, cool.
[22:10.430 --> 22:12.230]  I think that is how he got the cops on him.
[22:12.490 --> 22:12.670]  Yeah.
[22:13.030 --> 22:14.130]  Some of the dark magic.
[22:14.810 --> 22:16.570]  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell cop.
[22:19.990 --> 22:22.010]  That was the working title of Die Hard.
[22:22.810 --> 22:23.210]  Yeah.
[22:24.630 --> 22:26.590]  Has there ever been a movie called Jingle Hell?
[22:27.110 --> 22:27.790]  Because if not...
[22:27.790 --> 22:28.210]  Oh, wow.
[22:28.270 --> 22:28.970]  There's got to be, right?
[22:29.350 --> 22:30.270]  Has to be.
[22:30.750 --> 22:33.630]  Okay, so you still get the jingle bells when the cops are on you.
[22:34.230 --> 22:35.690]  Because I just found...
[22:35.690 --> 22:36.170]  Hey, Gavin.
[22:37.330 --> 22:38.850]  Oh, you're so cool, Eric.
[22:39.370 --> 22:39.710]  Gavin.
[22:39.750 --> 22:40.330]  Holy shit.
[22:40.770 --> 22:41.150]  Oh, baby.
[22:42.070 --> 22:42.830]  I'm trying.
[22:43.190 --> 22:44.630]  It won't let me pick up...
[22:44.630 --> 22:44.890]  Uh-oh.
[22:45.270 --> 22:46.470]  It might not let me pick up snow.
[22:47.070 --> 22:47.550]  Uh-oh.
[22:47.850 --> 22:48.190]  Hang on.
[22:48.310 --> 22:48.610]  Unhand.
[22:48.730 --> 22:48.910]  Okay.
[22:49.450 --> 22:50.490]  There we go.
[22:50.670 --> 22:51.450]  All right, boys.
[22:52.630 --> 22:52.990]  Missed.
[22:54.710 --> 22:55.270]  Come on.
[22:55.790 --> 22:56.190]  Come on.
[22:56.510 --> 22:57.170]  Then you can kill me.
[22:57.190 --> 22:57.710]  Then you can kill me.
[22:57.810 --> 22:58.070]  Yes!
[22:58.150 --> 22:58.990]  I'm at five, boys.
[22:59.050 --> 22:59.650]  I'm at five.
[23:00.550 --> 23:01.090]  Where's Eric?
[23:01.410 --> 23:02.330]  I don't even see him on the map.
[23:02.410 --> 23:03.650]  Did you remove yourself from the map, Eric?
[23:04.130 --> 23:04.410]  No.
[23:05.350 --> 23:05.710]  Weird.
[23:06.750 --> 23:08.390]  Oh, I probably went a different way than you did.
[23:08.750 --> 23:09.370]  Yeah, definitely.
[23:10.190 --> 23:11.630]  Oh, where are you?
[23:11.670 --> 23:13.410]  Dude, where the fuck is this one?
[23:15.650 --> 23:16.170]  Excuse me.
[23:16.270 --> 23:16.910]  Oh, God.
[23:17.010 --> 23:17.650]  Why'd you...
[23:17.650 --> 23:17.910]  Oh.
[23:20.710 --> 23:21.490]  Oh, no.
[23:21.750 --> 23:22.150]  Okay.
[23:22.670 --> 23:23.390]  Who's there?
[23:23.410 --> 23:24.290]  That'd be so cool if it was.
[23:24.310 --> 23:24.830]  Oh, damn it.
[23:25.190 --> 23:25.850]  They've killed me.
[23:26.590 --> 23:27.290]  It'd be so cool.
[23:27.290 --> 23:27.450]  But I'm at five.
[23:27.550 --> 23:29.090]  I'm at five of 25 snowmen.
[23:29.450 --> 23:31.670]  It would be so cool if I found it right here.
[23:31.990 --> 23:33.390]  Okay, so I'm trying to find...
[23:33.390 --> 23:33.610]  Okay.
[23:34.430 --> 23:35.170]  I think...
[23:35.170 --> 23:35.710]  Who is that?
[23:36.050 --> 23:36.550]  Who's that?
[23:36.750 --> 23:38.070]  Andrew, I think you're close to one.
[23:40.290 --> 23:41.570]  It's gotta be right around here.
[23:42.590 --> 23:44.410]  Are they ever, like, in the street?
[23:45.510 --> 23:47.870]  No, it looks like they're in yards and stuff.
[23:48.470 --> 23:49.870]  Probably where one would be.
[23:50.110 --> 23:50.470]  There we go.
[23:51.010 --> 23:52.870]  All right, so you found that one over there, Andrew?
[23:53.130 --> 23:53.450]  Yep.
[23:53.630 --> 23:53.990]  Okay, cool.
[23:54.090 --> 23:55.350]  That's where I'm headed next.
[23:55.710 --> 23:58.350]  There's one in the yard of Michael's house.
[24:00.390 --> 24:01.330]  Like, the gate opens.
[24:01.450 --> 24:02.850]  You don't have to, like, be tricky with it.
[24:02.890 --> 24:05.110]  Like, the gate just opens for you, and then it's, like, in the front yard.
[24:07.790 --> 24:08.150]  Four.
[24:09.410 --> 24:09.990]  Damn it!
[24:10.290 --> 24:11.210]  How many you got, Gavin?
[24:12.730 --> 24:13.090]  Three.
[24:13.090 --> 24:14.930]  Ooh, that is not a cool number, dude.
[24:15.730 --> 24:16.210]  Well, I know.
[24:16.690 --> 24:17.770]  Three's a pretty cool number.
[24:18.370 --> 24:20.270]  I heard Gavin said he wishes it was five.
[24:20.950 --> 24:22.110]  Well, there's a lot to be said for three.
[24:26.190 --> 24:29.530]  Let's just keep shitting on a fucking cool-ass number like three for no reason.
[24:30.030 --> 24:31.950]  I mean, three in some situations is great.
[24:32.890 --> 24:33.090]  Yeah.
[24:33.170 --> 24:33.370]  Uh-huh.
[24:34.210 --> 24:37.330]  Like, if you found that many millions of dollars, that'd be amazing.
[24:37.730 --> 24:39.670]  Now, consider finding five million.
[24:41.210 --> 24:42.390]  It seems like a lot of hassle.
[24:42.390 --> 24:42.790]  Yeah.
[24:43.550 --> 24:44.870]  It's too many million.
[24:45.790 --> 24:47.310]  Too many people asking for shit.
[24:47.390 --> 24:47.570]  Yeah.
[24:48.490 --> 24:50.490]  Andrew, was it by, like, the half-pipe or what?
[24:50.710 --> 24:51.510]  I ain't helping you.
[24:51.750 --> 24:52.530]  Oh, jeez.
[24:52.650 --> 24:52.830]  Wow.
[24:52.930 --> 24:53.170]  Okay.
[24:53.310 --> 24:53.530]  All right.
[24:53.650 --> 24:54.750]  In the spirit of competition.
[24:55.010 --> 24:55.290]  Got it.
[24:55.410 --> 24:56.430]  Thought we were being friends.
[24:56.610 --> 24:56.970]  Never mind.
[24:57.090 --> 24:57.670]  You got it, man.
[24:57.710 --> 24:58.150]  No problem.
[24:58.630 --> 25:00.130]  I mean, you saw how this video started.
[25:00.630 --> 25:00.890]  Yeah.
[25:01.190 --> 25:01.590]  No kidding.
[25:01.850 --> 25:02.430]  Uh, hey, guys.
[25:02.490 --> 25:04.870]  It's by the little quarter pipe that's next to the half-pipe.
[25:05.050 --> 25:05.610]  I'm just letting you know.
[25:06.530 --> 25:06.690]  Shit!
[25:06.690 --> 25:08.390]  I'm getting really minged off with this shit.
[25:08.990 --> 25:09.750]  I got six.
[25:10.170 --> 25:11.130]  I have five.
[25:11.970 --> 25:12.670]  Damn it!
[25:13.530 --> 25:16.130]  I need to just take screenshots of where everyone is.
[25:20.590 --> 25:21.930]  Oh, someone's near me.
[25:23.750 --> 25:24.550]  Who it is?
[25:24.890 --> 25:26.970]  Andrew, do you know where this frickin' one is?
[25:27.090 --> 25:27.290]  Yep.
[25:27.510 --> 25:28.590]  Oh, you found him immediately?
[25:30.030 --> 25:31.170]  Damn this map!
[25:32.030 --> 25:32.690]  That's five.
[25:37.110 --> 25:37.570]  Goddamn.
[25:37.950 --> 25:38.710]  Oh, I don't see it.
[25:40.410 --> 25:42.010]  Okay, I got too late.
[25:45.830 --> 25:47.490]  It says that there's a cache around here.
[25:47.530 --> 25:48.390]  I want to know what's in the cache.
[25:49.330 --> 25:51.490]  Take a break from your contest and find out.
[25:51.590 --> 25:52.730]  That's exactly what I'm doing.
[25:53.590 --> 25:54.070]  You get time.
[25:54.590 --> 25:54.790]  Yeah.
[25:55.190 --> 25:55.850]  Yeah, you're winning.
[25:56.550 --> 25:56.870]  Snowman!
[25:57.070 --> 26:01.090]  Yeah, but also, if I could get something out of this, that'd be great.
[26:01.410 --> 26:01.870]  Where's the cache?
[26:02.650 --> 26:02.930]  Is that it?
[26:02.950 --> 26:03.470]  Oh, there you are, Sam.
[26:04.470 --> 26:04.790]  Boom.
[26:05.870 --> 26:08.050]  If I use the snow gun...
[26:09.250 --> 26:09.690]  Oh.
[26:10.710 --> 26:11.470]  That's a good call.
[26:11.750 --> 26:12.690]  Boom, got it.
[26:14.050 --> 26:15.610]  Damn, got $19,000.
[26:16.750 --> 26:17.190]  Nice.
[26:17.530 --> 26:19.150]  That's a lot slower than just throwing them.
[26:19.430 --> 26:20.010]  That's crazy.
[26:20.470 --> 26:21.410]  You can deposit all this money.
[26:22.130 --> 26:22.930]  Does it do more damage?
[26:23.290 --> 26:23.670]  Goddamn.
[26:24.630 --> 26:24.830]  No.
[26:26.630 --> 26:26.810]  No.
[26:28.170 --> 26:29.130]  No, it sucks.
[26:29.610 --> 26:30.370]  Well, let's say...
[26:30.370 --> 26:32.350]  Do you have to shoot at the body or the head?
[26:32.730 --> 26:33.610]  I don't think...
[26:36.890 --> 26:40.270]  Let us know when you have five, so we won't do that to you anymore.
[26:47.310 --> 26:50.270]  Geoff, do you think about how you've been doing that to him for so many years,
[26:50.430 --> 26:52.910]  and then the last company went under, and then you started a new company,
[26:53.030 --> 26:54.190]  so you can keep doing it?
[26:54.410 --> 26:55.830]  That's the only reason I keep going.
[26:55.830 --> 26:56.670]  That's fine.
[26:59.070 --> 27:04.930]  I have a need to mock.
[27:05.290 --> 27:06.510]  This guy is so funny.
[27:06.630 --> 27:07.730]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[27:07.950 --> 27:10.550]  When in doubt, fall back to what you know.
[27:12.530 --> 27:12.970]  Man.
[27:13.590 --> 27:16.090]  Do you ever think you could just make these videos forever?
[27:17.390 --> 27:17.650]  Yeah.
[27:19.250 --> 27:20.050]  That's what we're doing.
[27:20.830 --> 27:21.650]  Oh, got it.
[27:22.250 --> 27:23.630]  Geoff, I think I'm with you right here.
[27:24.010 --> 27:24.310]  Oh, yeah?
[27:24.310 --> 27:27.950]  Yeah, I think we're moving up on the same one here.
[27:28.010 --> 27:28.750]  Please don't kill me.
[27:29.330 --> 27:30.290]  I'm not trying to win.
[27:30.370 --> 27:31.110]  I'm just trying to get them all.
[27:32.270 --> 27:34.850]  I'm happy to come in fourth with less hassle.
[27:35.290 --> 27:35.870]  I hear it.
[27:36.130 --> 27:36.750]  Where is it?
[27:37.230 --> 27:39.170]  You just don't want to repeat the ghost situation.
[27:41.830 --> 27:42.950]  Did you ever get those ghosts?
[27:43.730 --> 27:44.110]  No.
[27:44.750 --> 27:45.470]  The one I missed?
[27:46.170 --> 27:47.490]  Oh, hey, Geoff.
[27:48.470 --> 27:49.250]  It's over here.
[27:51.870 --> 27:52.850]  It's the map.
[27:52.850 --> 27:53.210]  I see it.
[27:53.530 --> 27:55.250]  The map not great.
[27:56.750 --> 27:57.190]  Andrew?
[27:58.070 --> 27:58.310]  Yeah?
[27:59.230 --> 28:00.910]  You're obviously using a better map.
[28:01.110 --> 28:02.110]  What version are you using?
[28:02.510 --> 28:05.090]  You're obviously using a better map.
[28:05.430 --> 28:08.090]  He went straight to one I sucked at.
[28:08.610 --> 28:10.810]  So that's five for me. Is that six for you, Eric?
[28:11.470 --> 28:12.430]  It might be seven.
[28:12.870 --> 28:14.610]  I wonder where you got two that I didn't get.
[28:16.350 --> 28:17.710]  Did you go to Michael's house yet?
[28:19.290 --> 28:20.050]  That's one.
[28:21.810 --> 28:23.790]  Where the fuck is this thing?
[28:24.570 --> 28:26.030]  I'm going over to where Gavin is.
[28:26.390 --> 28:29.390]  Oh, sweet. You'll help me find this one when you find it straight away.
[28:31.230 --> 28:32.450]  How many will that put you at?
[28:32.990 --> 28:33.350]  Five.
[28:34.490 --> 28:36.630]  That's great! Then Geoff can't make fun of you anymore.
[28:40.310 --> 28:42.250]  I wonder what this would be like if Nick was here.
[28:44.270 --> 28:45.550]  I guess we'll never know.
[28:45.890 --> 28:46.130]  Yep.
[28:46.610 --> 28:48.090]  There'd be a lot more God bless Americas.
[28:51.650 --> 28:54.230]  Dag blast it! Or some shit like that.
[28:55.550 --> 28:57.450]  Nick hitting a couple of hearts. Shucks.
[28:59.870 --> 29:02.250]  Gotta give it up. He's got a kid. He's trying not to swear.
[29:02.490 --> 29:03.990]  That's pretty good. That's cool.
[29:05.430 --> 29:07.190]  He's trying harder than I ever did for that shit.
[29:07.210 --> 29:09.370]  Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm not like that. I don't give a shit.
[29:11.970 --> 29:13.310]  God bless America.
[29:13.830 --> 29:14.690]  That's so funny.
[29:15.890 --> 29:16.770]  Gavin, did you find it?
[29:17.730 --> 29:18.070]  No!
[29:18.070 --> 29:19.550]  Oh, okay.
[29:23.910 --> 29:30.230]  I think it's gotta be down this back alley where you are.
[29:30.930 --> 29:31.030]  Yeah.
[29:31.110 --> 29:31.630]  It's not over here?
[29:32.010 --> 29:32.670]  I'll just follow you.
[29:32.850 --> 29:33.550]  Sure, probably.
[29:35.210 --> 29:36.070]  Fuck off, Ron.
[29:37.570 --> 29:40.970]  Do we hear any jingle bells? I don't hear anything yet.
[29:42.110 --> 29:43.850]  Ah, shit. There it is.
[29:44.330 --> 29:45.090]  Where? What?
[29:45.370 --> 29:46.670]  In the bloody skate park.
[29:48.650 --> 29:51.190]  Oh, it is. Oh, that's weird. I don't hear anything.
[29:52.550 --> 29:53.930]  Why don't I hear anything for this?
[29:55.290 --> 29:55.690]  Silence, no.
[29:56.290 --> 29:57.070]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry.
[29:59.630 --> 30:01.590]  The rat just started fucking throwing hands.
[30:01.790 --> 30:02.490]  Hey, that's five.
[30:04.110 --> 30:05.170]  Alright, next one.
[30:06.230 --> 30:07.190]  Aw, Geoff, did you find that one?
[30:07.190 --> 30:08.090]  Alright, there we go.
[30:08.250 --> 30:10.250]  No, I'm getting killed by cops right now.
[30:10.610 --> 30:11.150]  I'm at eight.
[30:11.890 --> 30:16.270]  It's, uh, I decided it'd just be easier to get wasted. I couldn't remove my wanted level because I had three.
[30:17.450 --> 30:18.650]  Alright, Team Tape, let's go.
[30:19.390 --> 30:19.990]  Team Tape!
[30:21.590 --> 30:22.730]  I don't know where you're going.
[30:23.370 --> 30:24.990]  I'm just trying to get back to the road.
[30:25.750 --> 30:26.290]  Got it.
[30:30.100 --> 30:30.760]  Thanks for the lift.
[30:31.100 --> 30:31.260]  See ya.
[30:36.140 --> 30:39.220]  Did, uh, did your small wife's mother-in-law hear any messages?
[30:39.940 --> 30:41.940]  Yes, she, yeah, yeah, she thought it was very funny.
[30:42.180 --> 30:42.360]  Oh.
[30:43.060 --> 30:45.600]  I didn't want to say anything too foul in case you played them.
[30:45.600 --> 30:50.620]  She couldn't, she kept, we've been talking a lot about popcorn seeds.
[30:55.480 --> 31:01.760]  She listens to the show and then she will say stuff like, I just don't, popcorn seeds?
[31:02.860 --> 31:04.560]  It's like, oh good, you do listen.
[31:06.060 --> 31:08.980]  Is she equally, is she equally small?
[31:10.360 --> 31:13.120]  Uh, yeah, yeah, she's, yeah, she's pretty similarly small.
[31:13.420 --> 31:13.600]  Okay.
[31:16.660 --> 31:19.300]  My wife comes from a small lineage, yeah.
[31:20.220 --> 31:20.580]  Shit.
[31:21.780 --> 31:22.500]  Family shrub.
[31:23.100 --> 31:23.280]  Yeah.
[31:26.380 --> 31:28.820]  Did you, uh, did you get everything you wanted for Christmas, Gavin?
[31:30.300 --> 31:30.660]  Yeah.
[31:30.860 --> 31:32.420]  Like three new, three new pinball games or something?
[31:32.800 --> 31:33.040]  No.
[31:33.820 --> 31:34.800]  I don't want any more of them.
[31:34.800 --> 31:36.000]  The same Bo Burnham vinyls?
[31:36.180 --> 31:37.000]  Didn't get any of those either.
[31:37.740 --> 31:39.240]  Oh, boo, I don't think you got anything then.
[31:39.480 --> 31:40.360]  I don't think you got anything good.
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.000]  It was a no Burnham Christmas for you?
[31:43.000 --> 31:43.540]  Yeah.
[31:47.100 --> 31:47.900]  That's terrible.
[31:48.860 --> 31:52.900]  You know what, I've had 30 no Burnham Christmases and I think the streak will continue.
[31:52.920 --> 31:54.080]  Yeah, I think we're gonna keep it going.
[31:54.180 --> 31:55.800]  You never had a single Burnham Christmas?
[31:56.300 --> 31:58.160]  Yeah, but you're used to it.
[32:00.320 --> 32:02.220]  Well, I don't know what this fucking thing is.
[32:02.700 --> 32:03.100]  Boys?
[32:04.740 --> 32:06.080]  Hey, it's Paige Harris.
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.120]  Yeah, I'm at nine.
[32:07.360 --> 32:07.500]  Okay.
[32:09.260 --> 32:10.780]  How you doing, Gavin? Have you found that one yet?
[32:11.340 --> 32:11.660]  No.
[32:12.260 --> 32:18.660]  I can only find them if I look at someone else find them or if someone's with me as I've... what?
[32:21.820 --> 32:22.240]  Idiot.
[32:27.820 --> 32:29.020]  It's so good.
[32:30.940 --> 32:31.360]  What?
[32:33.880 --> 32:35.720]  Looks like that's the next one. Okay.
[32:36.960 --> 32:38.700]  Making moves, boys, making moves.
[32:39.060 --> 32:39.480]  Hey, Geoff.
[32:39.500 --> 32:40.100]  What are you doing now?
[32:40.100 --> 32:40.480]  Yeah.
[32:40.580 --> 32:41.060]  Up here.
[32:41.900 --> 32:43.260]  Look, you see me?
[32:44.180 --> 32:44.620]  No.
[32:45.100 --> 32:47.080]  I'm up here on the roof, Geoff.
[32:48.540 --> 32:50.900]  He's up on the rooftop? Click, click, click?
[32:51.120 --> 32:51.900]  Oh, there you are.
[32:52.460 --> 32:53.160]  Did you see it?
[32:53.240 --> 32:54.360]  No, I'm gonna come down though.
[32:55.120 --> 32:56.280]  Hey, you see that car there?
[32:56.940 --> 32:57.340]  Yeah.
[32:57.460 --> 32:58.100]  Check this out.
[32:59.380 --> 33:00.180]  Oh my God.
[33:02.060 --> 33:03.120]  Where are you?
[33:04.400 --> 33:06.280]  I didn't see any...
[33:06.280 --> 33:08.280]  Oh, I was looking at the wrong car, maybe.
[33:11.220 --> 33:12.100]  Let's do that again.
[33:16.420 --> 33:17.680]  Let's go ahead and do that one more time.
[33:17.720 --> 33:18.380]  Uh-oh.
[33:18.440 --> 33:19.360]  I'll do it for first person.
[33:21.920 --> 33:23.680]  No, that was perfect.
[33:26.300 --> 33:27.080]  That was good enough.
[33:27.180 --> 33:29.280]  That was about as good as, hey, Geoff, can you fill this?
[33:29.680 --> 33:30.860]  And then getting my phone back.
[33:31.640 --> 33:31.880]  Yeah.
[33:32.540 --> 33:34.140]  I still don't see this fucking snowman.
[33:34.140 --> 33:34.880]  Oh my God.
[33:35.120 --> 33:35.300]  Me neither.
[33:35.920 --> 33:36.900]  Might be seven parts.
[33:37.380 --> 33:41.300]  I'm all paranoid now that it's around, but I can't, it's not jingling.
[33:41.640 --> 33:44.940]  Oh, no, Eric's gonna win in like 15 minutes and then we'll all have nine.
[33:46.380 --> 33:47.560]  No, no, no.
[33:47.800 --> 33:49.500]  Oh, I popped my car in a sinkhole.
[33:49.940 --> 33:50.360]  What was that?
[33:50.580 --> 33:51.600]  It looked like that.
[33:52.660 --> 33:53.120]  Uh-oh.
[33:54.100 --> 33:55.160]  I'm never gonna...
[33:55.160 --> 33:57.560]  I'm not gonna win because I can't make it through traffic.
[33:57.780 --> 34:01.640]  I'm getting, like, head-on blasted by people.
[34:02.280 --> 34:02.680]  Goddamn.
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.140]  How many are you on, Andrew?
[34:05.200 --> 34:06.100]  I don't even know.
[34:06.100 --> 34:07.760]  I've been stuck for a long time.
[34:09.080 --> 34:11.600]  I mean, awful map, man.
[34:15.000 --> 34:15.400]  Yeah.
[34:15.600 --> 34:16.220]  No, I agree.
[34:16.880 --> 34:18.320]  Well, it's not a coy.
[34:18.420 --> 34:18.960]  This is correct.
[34:20.220 --> 34:21.020]  Over there?
[34:21.280 --> 34:21.700]  Is it?
[34:22.820 --> 34:23.860]  Is it like...
[34:23.860 --> 34:25.120]  Oh, shit.
[34:25.480 --> 34:26.080]  Found it, Geoff.
[34:26.080 --> 34:26.580]  Fuck off, Martin.
[34:27.040 --> 34:27.680]  Oh, did you?
[34:27.760 --> 34:27.900]  Yeah.
[34:28.620 --> 34:29.000]  Come on.
[34:29.140 --> 34:29.720]  Come to me.
[34:30.620 --> 34:31.200]  Coming to you, lad.
[34:35.300 --> 34:37.200]  I was headed in the wrong direction, man.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.000]  Six.
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.020]  God, I must have...
[34:41.620 --> 34:42.420]  Wait, where is it?
[34:44.480 --> 34:45.040]  Right here.
[34:45.920 --> 34:48.820]  Oh, I don't see it.
[34:49.820 --> 34:50.560]  Did I already get this one?
[34:50.900 --> 34:51.260]  You might have.
[34:51.900 --> 34:52.780]  Well, what are you doing over here, then?
[34:55.040 --> 34:55.400]  Oh.
[34:56.300 --> 34:57.660]  I guess I did already get it.
[34:58.140 --> 34:58.940]  Well, why are you over here?
[34:59.760 --> 35:01.640]  Oh, no, he's ghosting it.
[35:02.080 --> 35:05.540]  Uh, I need to go up...
[35:05.540 --> 35:06.940]  Oh, my God.
[35:06.940 --> 35:09.280]  All right, I marked it on the map.
[35:09.360 --> 35:10.340]  I don't know if you can see my map.
[35:10.640 --> 35:12.860]  I'm fucking running all over the place like a fool.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.020]  I have no idea where this fucking thing is.
[35:16.580 --> 35:20.260]  This map took me the longest way to get to the other side of this...
[35:20.260 --> 35:22.120]  God damn, this sucks.
[35:22.320 --> 35:23.420]  Geoff, do you have the one that's up here?
[35:23.600 --> 35:24.480]  Is it down here?
[35:24.480 --> 35:24.800]  What's that?
[35:24.940 --> 35:25.860]  Do you have the one that's around here?
[35:27.080 --> 35:28.260]  Uh, I don't know where around here is.
[35:28.300 --> 35:28.620]  Let me see.
[35:28.800 --> 35:29.700]  Uh, no, I don't think so.
[35:29.780 --> 35:31.120]  That's the one I'm going for.
[35:31.300 --> 35:31.700]  Do you have it?
[35:32.640 --> 35:32.920]  Nah.
[35:34.060 --> 35:35.340]  It should be right here somewhere, right?
[35:35.800 --> 35:37.220]  Yeah, I'm gonna get around the back of this.
[35:39.660 --> 35:40.260]  Oh, God.
[35:41.020 --> 35:41.720]  Oh, come on.
[35:41.860 --> 35:43.320]  Oh, it could be right up in this bit.
[35:43.340 --> 35:44.340]  It looks like it could be in here.
[35:46.820 --> 35:48.740]  This would be a perfect spot for a snowman.
[35:49.880 --> 35:50.680]  You're just looking around.
[35:51.720 --> 35:53.520]  Oh, I'd build a snowman here, yeah, for sure.
[35:54.020 --> 35:54.520]  Where is it?
[35:54.520 --> 35:55.200]  Oh, it's right here, Geoff.
[35:55.320 --> 35:55.540]  Oh.
[35:56.600 --> 35:57.140]  I see it.
[35:57.860 --> 35:59.120]  Oh, it's the second skate park.
[35:59.760 --> 36:01.200]  Yeah, there's two skate parks, apparently.
[36:04.300 --> 36:04.660]  Okay.
[36:04.780 --> 36:05.840]  That's six for me.
[36:05.960 --> 36:06.600]  How many do you have, Gavin?
[36:08.600 --> 36:09.320]  Uh, one...
[36:10.200 --> 36:10.560]  Die!
[36:10.840 --> 36:11.160]  Seven!
[36:11.280 --> 36:11.780]  It's gotta be in here.
[36:12.260 --> 36:13.400]  Okay, well, then I'm fucked.
[36:13.580 --> 36:14.740]  How do I have six from the other side?
[36:15.380 --> 36:17.160]  Well, we all, we all went different paths.
[36:17.580 --> 36:20.460]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[36:20.500 --> 36:21.580]  No, that would be six for me.
[36:21.720 --> 36:21.920]  Okay.
[36:22.060 --> 36:23.460]  I'm so sick of running everywhere.
[36:24.620 --> 36:24.880]  Oh!
[36:25.440 --> 36:26.760]  All right, my next one.
[36:26.960 --> 36:27.740]  That might be Michael's house.
[36:27.740 --> 36:28.160]  Get away!
[36:29.440 --> 36:30.160]  Stupid cars.
[36:31.020 --> 36:33.300]  Oh, I'm totally in the wrong fucking spot.
[36:33.900 --> 36:34.320]  Goddamn.
[36:34.580 --> 36:35.420]  Wasn't even close.
[36:35.660 --> 36:36.540]  Did you just find one?
[36:36.900 --> 36:37.240]  Oof.
[36:38.100 --> 36:39.400]  No, I was, uh...
[36:39.400 --> 36:42.160]  I was looking around, then I re-looked at the map, and I started, like...
[36:42.820 --> 36:43.240]  I...
[36:43.240 --> 36:43.500]  Ah!
[36:43.980 --> 36:45.300]  What the fuck is this?
[36:45.420 --> 36:46.420]  What is this guy?
[36:46.600 --> 36:47.480]  What is this guy?
[36:48.220 --> 36:49.820]  What's the blue Yeti man?
[36:50.040 --> 36:51.100]  It's Santa Claus.
[36:51.140 --> 36:51.700]  What is that?
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.380]  What is that?
[36:53.760 --> 36:54.660]  What are you talking about?
[36:54.660 --> 36:55.320]  What is that?
[36:55.680 --> 36:57.120]  He just appeared out of nowhere.
[36:57.900 --> 36:58.460]  What's happening?
[36:58.560 --> 36:59.420]  Oh, is it the Gooch?
[36:59.420 --> 37:00.120]  Did you get Gooch?
[37:00.240 --> 37:01.060]  The Gooch has stolen money!
[37:01.220 --> 37:02.280]  What the fuck was that?
[37:02.660 --> 37:03.600]  You got Gooch, dude.
[37:03.720 --> 37:04.500]  Is that the Grink?
[37:05.120 --> 37:05.500]  Yeah.
[37:06.460 --> 37:07.280]  That's the Gooch.
[37:07.500 --> 37:09.060]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[37:09.720 --> 37:10.360]  The Grink!
[37:11.020 --> 37:12.280]  Andrew read it to us.
[37:12.660 --> 37:14.000]  I think when he was talking about the description.
[37:14.180 --> 37:17.580]  The Gooch outfit has been unlocked at your... whatever.
[37:17.580 --> 37:19.100]  Oh yeah, you're visited by the Gooch.
[37:19.800 --> 37:20.320]  I was...
[37:20.320 --> 37:22.320]  The Grink was there?
[37:22.440 --> 37:23.260]  What the fuck?
[37:23.380 --> 37:23.520]  I wanna get Gooched.
[37:24.880 --> 37:25.580]  He just came...
[37:25.580 --> 37:27.280]  He pops up out of nowhere, and he goes,
[37:28.960 --> 37:31.120]  And then he pulls you out of a car.
[37:33.520 --> 37:35.060]  Can you fight him and kill him?
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.440]  Oh, I just... I fucking put bullets in the back of his head, yeah.
[37:38.700 --> 37:42.380]  And then he drops a present, and you get to wear the outfit or whatever.
[37:43.440 --> 37:45.960]  Maybe it's if you kill too many snowmen, he gets pissed.
[37:46.740 --> 37:46.980]  Yeah.
[37:48.780 --> 37:52.680]  I think it randomly happens every, like, 48 minutes.
[37:53.160 --> 37:53.600]  Oh, really?
[37:54.440 --> 37:54.720]  Yeah.
[37:54.900 --> 37:55.920]  You were the lucky boy.
[37:55.920 --> 37:58.060]  It picks one person in the session.
[37:58.300 --> 37:58.640]  Oh, shit.
[37:59.260 --> 38:00.460]  Grink versus Rat.
[38:02.060 --> 38:03.180]  The Rat wins again.
[38:03.640 --> 38:07.980]  I think the scariest Yeti in video games is the SkiFree.
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.100]  Oh yeah, it's a pretty scary one.
[38:11.400 --> 38:12.880]  SkiFree, part of your family tree.
[38:15.540 --> 38:16.020]  ScrappyDew.
[38:19.500 --> 38:19.980]  MissingLinkDew.
[38:20.600 --> 38:24.580]  Did you guys find one in the big city park with the giant Christmas tree in the middle of it?
[38:25.800 --> 38:28.580]  Uh, yeah, with all, like, uh...
[38:30.040 --> 38:32.920]  Yeah, it's sort of, like, near the road, I think.
[38:33.000 --> 38:33.940]  It's, like, not too, too far.
[38:34.960 --> 38:35.940]  I hear it, I hear it.
[38:36.060 --> 38:36.780]  It's in that big park.
[38:36.800 --> 38:37.960]  Yes, I believe so.
[38:41.700 --> 38:42.300]  Come on.
[38:42.760 --> 38:44.060]  Do this and you can kill me, I don't care.
[38:47.660 --> 38:48.020]  Oh.
[38:49.080 --> 38:49.440]  Yes!
[38:50.000 --> 38:50.660]  Ten snowmen.
[38:53.280 --> 38:54.000]  Ten snowmen.
[38:54.460 --> 38:55.740]  I'm at ten snowmen.
[38:55.940 --> 38:56.260]  I'm so lost.
[38:56.260 --> 38:58.540]  Would you like to built in snowmen?
[38:59.220 --> 39:01.780]  I'm gonna spend the whole goddamn video trying to find this one.
[39:02.580 --> 39:03.320]  How long have you been looking?
[39:05.180 --> 39:07.400]  Probably, like, ten minutes, at least.
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.180]  Gotta be around.
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.500]  There's gotta be a better way.
[39:12.960 --> 39:15.420]  If this starts me on a different mission, I'm gonna be so fucking pissed.
[39:15.880 --> 39:17.040]  Of course it's gonna be a different mission.
[39:17.520 --> 39:17.640]  Ah!
[39:17.800 --> 39:18.300]  There you are.
[39:19.800 --> 39:21.160]  I've investigated the flare.
[39:21.980 --> 39:22.500]  Good job.
[39:23.240 --> 39:25.280]  Look for another flare highlighting the next location.
[39:25.280 --> 39:26.860]  Follow the trail before it disappears.
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.220]  I don't give a shit or a fuck.
[39:29.600 --> 39:32.940]  I can't believe how much shit is in this game that I've never heard of.
[39:33.100 --> 39:34.060]  Yeah, no kidding.
[39:35.420 --> 39:36.520]  Investigate a flare?
[39:37.220 --> 39:40.120]  Yeah, it was just on the ground with a bunch of shit coming out.
[39:42.080 --> 39:43.160]  I hear it, finally!
[39:43.380 --> 39:44.780]  Are you at that next snowman, Gavin?
[39:45.520 --> 39:46.540]  Uh, I'm looking for it.
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.720]  You son of a bitch!
[39:48.160 --> 39:48.880]  Did you find it, Andrew?
[39:49.520 --> 39:49.920]  Finally!
[39:50.900 --> 39:51.560]  Where it was?
[39:52.180 --> 39:53.120]  What number was it for you?
[39:53.920 --> 39:55.300]  Uh, seven.
[39:55.660 --> 39:56.020]  Nice.
[39:57.140 --> 39:58.680]  Wait, you and Gavin are tied then, dude. Way to go.
[39:59.060 --> 40:00.380]  I think I have seven as well.
[40:01.860 --> 40:02.640]  Oh, man.
[40:04.200 --> 40:04.580]  Uh-oh!
[40:04.900 --> 40:05.400]  Uh-oh!
[40:05.540 --> 40:05.760]  Oh.
[40:07.100 --> 40:07.900]  Ooh, I hear it.
[40:08.340 --> 40:09.560]  Ooh, baby, I hear it!
[40:11.120 --> 40:11.480]  Yes!
[40:13.820 --> 40:13.980]  Heh.
[40:14.680 --> 40:16.280]  Shit, it cost me like 300 bucks.
[40:16.580 --> 40:18.660]  Oh, 1,500 bucks to be in this game.
[40:19.560 --> 40:20.460]  Yeah, every day.
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.020]  You find that one over there, Gavin?
[40:23.140 --> 40:23.420]  No.
[40:25.380 --> 40:26.880]  Is that the one you were having trouble with, Andrew?
[40:27.820 --> 40:28.100]  No.
[40:28.960 --> 40:29.680]  Where am I going next?
[40:30.240 --> 40:31.880]  Gotta be around here?
[40:33.300 --> 40:34.700]  I'm here to look for you, with you, Gavin.
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.620]  Uh, this is like the shopping center we used to go to Killer Shrimp at all the time in L.A.
[40:39.760 --> 40:40.540]  Me and Bernie and Matt.
[40:41.060 --> 40:41.300]  And Gil.
[40:42.560 --> 40:45.100]  I mean, there's like 800 of these in L.A.
[40:45.860 --> 40:47.660]  Yeah, I know. They all look exactly the same.
[40:48.080 --> 40:48.640]  I don't understand.
[40:48.660 --> 40:51.040]  But one of them had a Killer Shrimp that we loved.
[40:57.620 --> 40:59.360]  I can't believe that Grink tried to kill me.
[40:59.720 --> 41:01.080]  Did any of them have a snowman still?
[41:01.100 --> 41:01.320]  I hear it.
[41:02.300 --> 41:03.300]  I hear it over here.
[41:04.200 --> 41:05.140]  Hey guys, over here.
[41:05.260 --> 41:05.640]  Oh, shit.
[41:10.290 --> 41:13.350]  Do you guys have a rhyme or reason for like the way you're moving through the map?
[41:13.410 --> 41:14.610]  Or are you just sort of like...
[41:14.610 --> 41:16.170]  I have a... yeah, I have a system.
[41:16.890 --> 41:17.690]  I'm just swooping.
[41:20.210 --> 41:20.930]  Just swooping?
[41:21.010 --> 41:21.190]  Yeah.
[41:21.970 --> 41:22.630]  I'm just having fun.
[41:23.950 --> 41:26.870]  Alright, I've almost got the city done.
[41:27.490 --> 41:28.110]  Uh-oh.
[41:29.090 --> 41:29.870]  Romeo, done.
[41:31.050 --> 41:31.570]  Uh-oh.
[41:31.710 --> 41:32.030]  Uh-oh.
[41:32.690 --> 41:33.090]  Tree.
[41:35.490 --> 41:36.810]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[41:38.930 --> 41:39.810]  That was close.
[41:40.010 --> 41:40.770]  You left a door.
[41:41.890 --> 41:43.050]  I sure did. You can have that.
[41:43.110 --> 41:43.690]  It's for you.
[41:43.810 --> 41:44.410]  Merry Christmas.
[41:45.670 --> 41:48.890]  I don't want to turn into a GTA only channel or anything.
[41:49.670 --> 41:52.290]  But I'm having so much fun playing GTA.
[41:52.290 --> 41:52.850]  Let's do it.
[41:52.950 --> 41:54.230]  And you guys have all the heists.
[41:54.310 --> 41:54.430]  Yes.
[41:54.430 --> 41:56.690]  I don't have nothing to do with that.
[41:56.750 --> 41:57.650]  But there's still like...
[41:57.650 --> 41:58.710]  I keep seeing shit to do.
[41:59.070 --> 42:00.690]  Like those TikToks I sent you.
[42:00.750 --> 42:02.070]  The guy getting people to chase him.
[42:02.930 --> 42:05.090]  Or sliding down that chiliad on that door.
[42:05.290 --> 42:06.030]  I want to try that.
[42:06.470 --> 42:06.650]  Yeah.
[42:06.830 --> 42:08.770]  I just want to keep playing this fucking game.
[42:08.890 --> 42:09.610]  It is amazing.
[42:10.090 --> 42:12.650]  It's so cool to come back to it almost a decade later.
[42:12.910 --> 42:14.710]  And see how much they added for us.
[42:17.370 --> 42:18.030]  I'll be honest.
[42:18.090 --> 42:19.490]  I never really got sick of this game.
[42:20.070 --> 42:20.450]  I did.
[42:20.770 --> 42:21.150]  For sure.
[42:21.150 --> 42:24.270]  I got sick of having to make maps.
[42:25.730 --> 42:29.090]  The map making was a real pain in the ass, dude.
[42:29.710 --> 42:31.210]  Yeah, it was a jank to...
[42:31.210 --> 42:33.170]  Did you find something here, Geoff, already?
[42:33.930 --> 42:34.610]  Not yet.
[42:35.430 --> 42:37.270]  A bunch of squiggly squagglies.
[42:37.890 --> 42:40.050]  And then a big boop de boop.
[42:40.350 --> 42:41.570]  Oh, you found squiggly squagglies?
[42:42.290 --> 42:42.950]  Um, yeah.
[42:43.530 --> 42:44.170]  I think so.
[42:44.430 --> 42:44.590]  Okay.
[42:45.850 --> 42:48.650]  Man, when you find a car that can like...
[42:48.650 --> 42:49.770]  Drive in the snow.
[42:50.610 --> 42:51.710]  Boy, don't let it go.
[42:52.670 --> 42:53.850]  It makes this so...
[42:53.850 --> 42:54.930]  Like, I don't know what...
[42:54.930 --> 42:56.310]  I was like slipping and sliding earlier.
[42:56.390 --> 42:57.170]  It was so bad.
[42:57.310 --> 42:58.290]  I found some other car.
[42:58.490 --> 42:59.650]  I'm just flying.
[43:00.410 --> 43:00.690]  I don't know if it's...
[43:00.690 --> 43:01.830]  Oh, should we be at Michael's house?
[43:02.390 --> 43:02.790]  Is it?
[43:02.850 --> 43:03.570]  Where's Michael's house?
[43:04.710 --> 43:05.930]  I just left it.
[43:05.990 --> 43:06.970]  If you look at me on the mini-map.
[43:07.130 --> 43:07.290]  Yeah.
[43:07.370 --> 43:08.110]  I'm right next to it.
[43:08.230 --> 43:10.090]  It's just like right in his front yard.
[43:10.350 --> 43:10.810]  Very easy.
[43:13.190 --> 43:13.550]  What?
[43:16.350 --> 43:16.670]  Are you okay?
[43:21.170 --> 43:22.270]  How do I get out of here?
[43:24.250 --> 43:25.970]  Andrew, what do we get for collecting all the snowmen?
[43:26.030 --> 43:26.370]  Do you know?
[43:27.250 --> 43:30.250]  Uh, cash for each one and then the snowman outfit at the end.
[43:31.530 --> 43:33.570]  Man, I don't even remember which one Michael's house is.
[43:33.870 --> 43:34.770]  Is it marked on the map?
[43:35.970 --> 43:36.810]  Shit, no.
[43:36.950 --> 43:37.650]  No, not in multiplayer.
[43:38.250 --> 43:38.550]  Mm-mm.
[43:39.710 --> 43:40.270]  Is it this one?
[43:40.270 --> 43:41.590]  I know he's got a tennis court.
[43:42.010 --> 43:42.650]  Is it this one?
[43:43.750 --> 43:44.950]  This doesn't feel right, does it?
[43:45.550 --> 43:46.410]  No, I don't...
[43:46.410 --> 43:48.030]  I don't think I ever go in from that side.
[43:48.190 --> 43:48.830]  Alright, where the...
[43:49.290 --> 43:51.630]  Okay, so that means it's gotta be in here.
[43:52.310 --> 43:53.530]  There's no way it's not.
[43:55.670 --> 43:56.470]  Yes! Okay, cool.
[43:56.850 --> 43:57.270]  Gate opens.
[43:57.390 --> 43:57.770]  Fuck yeah.
[43:58.130 --> 43:58.830]  So it's gotta be in here.
[44:01.230 --> 44:02.090]  10 of 25.
[44:02.690 --> 44:03.290]  Nice, dude.
[44:03.390 --> 44:03.910]  Nice, Andrew.
[44:05.150 --> 44:10.310]  Now, the scenario I'm so nervous of is getting to 24 of 25 and having no clue.
[44:10.570 --> 44:14.110]  Oh, there's no way I'm gonna be able to read the map to go back to think, like, what I got.
[44:15.930 --> 44:16.890]  Are you at Michael's house?
[44:17.530 --> 44:18.250]  Gavin, are you okay?
[44:18.950 --> 44:19.730]  He's just dead.
[44:20.070 --> 44:21.330]  He's just dead in his car.
[44:21.510 --> 44:22.790]  Is Gavin still with us?
[44:23.030 --> 44:23.150]  Gavin?
[44:25.670 --> 44:26.850]  So he got disconnected?
[44:26.890 --> 44:28.110]  He's having one of those conversations.
[44:29.210 --> 44:30.510]  Oh, you think he's talking to Shmi?
[44:31.310 --> 44:32.270]  I think so, yeah.
[44:32.690 --> 44:33.790]  Don't piss in here.
[44:35.410 --> 44:36.730]  Now, listen here, cat.
[44:38.670 --> 44:40.210]  Bang out of order what you're doing.
[44:40.830 --> 44:42.890]  A bang out of order is pretty good.
[44:44.390 --> 44:46.910]  I'm sorry to use such harsh language, but it's all I can do.
[44:47.910 --> 44:49.430]  It's bang out of order.
[44:49.630 --> 44:50.970]  How the fuck am I supposed to?
[44:51.050 --> 44:52.210]  It has to be in here.
[44:53.550 --> 44:54.770]  How do I get in here?
[44:56.150 --> 44:58.090]  I can't fucking find Michael's house.
[44:58.170 --> 44:58.790]  I'm so dumb.
[44:59.810 --> 45:01.130]  Oh, is it over here?
[45:03.730 --> 45:04.690]  Oh, there it is.
[45:04.810 --> 45:05.250]  Fuck yeah.
[45:09.070 --> 45:11.170]  One, two, three.
[45:11.450 --> 45:11.770]  Boom.
[45:12.270 --> 45:12.710]  Thirteen.
[45:14.570 --> 45:15.010]  Nice.
[45:15.010 --> 45:16.670]  You need a lot of money for these.
[45:17.590 --> 45:18.170]  Yeah, you do.
[45:19.410 --> 45:20.290]  Is this Michael's house?
[45:20.290 --> 45:21.410]  I'm gonna bring up this map.
[45:23.430 --> 45:24.150]  Okay, so...
[45:24.650 --> 45:25.250]  Let's see.
[45:26.390 --> 45:28.470]  Gotta try to match it up the best I can.
[45:28.650 --> 45:29.890]  Okay, so it's on the west side.
[45:31.650 --> 45:32.970]  Looks like it's...
[45:32.970 --> 45:33.470]  Eleven.
[45:34.210 --> 45:34.570]  Here?
[45:35.590 --> 45:37.130]  Oh my god, what the fuck?
[45:38.630 --> 45:39.670]  That's not even close.
[45:39.790 --> 45:40.490]  What is this?
[45:41.010 --> 45:42.390]  Michael's house has a tennis court, right?
[45:43.070 --> 45:44.270]  Yeah, he has a tennis court.
[45:45.730 --> 45:47.330]  I'm pretty sure this is it, then.
[45:48.630 --> 45:50.650]  Where are you, snowman? I don't see you.
[45:52.170 --> 45:54.030]  Are you in the tennis court?
[45:54.510 --> 45:57.930]  I needed to get stuck, so I'm happy to be hearing this tennis court drama.
[46:00.330 --> 46:02.030]  Where the fuck is this?
[46:03.750 --> 46:06.590]  Oh boy, I'm getting mixed up, boys.
[46:08.290 --> 46:13.230]  When you start getting deep, you should really keep track of which ones you got and which ones you didn't.
[46:13.230 --> 46:17.210]  Because I'm starting to get mixed up on what I got and what I didn't. I'm like...
[46:17.210 --> 46:17.970]  Uh oh.
[46:18.610 --> 46:19.870]  Where was it at Michael's house?
[46:20.490 --> 46:21.050]  What's that?
[46:21.450 --> 46:22.570]  Where was it at Michael's house?
[46:22.890 --> 46:23.530]  In the front yard?
[46:23.670 --> 46:24.090]  Front lawn.
[46:24.670 --> 46:24.870]  Oh.
[46:26.510 --> 46:28.210]  Well, that's gonna be a problem for me.
[46:30.430 --> 46:30.870]  Why?
[46:31.250 --> 46:31.570]  Yeah?
[46:31.850 --> 46:33.350]  This house doesn't seem to have a front lawn.
[46:33.870 --> 46:35.870]  I think maybe you're not at the right house.
[46:36.070 --> 46:37.470]  No, you're at the wrong house.
[46:38.530 --> 46:40.550]  Well, I just get two wildly different answers.
[46:42.330 --> 46:44.790]  I think they were the same, just phrased slightly differently.
[46:44.990 --> 46:45.170]  Yep.
[46:45.930 --> 46:47.930]  I think we're in agreement, you're not at his house.
[46:48.010 --> 46:50.150]  Yeah, you're definitely... there's no way, right?
[46:51.130 --> 46:52.150]  Zero percent chance.
[46:52.750 --> 46:54.050]  No, that's not his house.
[46:54.110 --> 46:55.930]  You hear the jingling from outside the gate?
[46:55.930 --> 46:56.470]  I just left.
[47:00.270 --> 47:02.810]  Oh, fuck. I got... oh, I trapped myself.
[47:05.370 --> 47:07.470]  Oh, this car is getting destroyed.
[47:07.590 --> 47:09.610]  Oh no. Uh oh. Oh, down the hill.
[47:10.070 --> 47:10.470]  Oh.
[47:11.910 --> 47:22.390]  Dude, I just spent so much time cross-referencing a map with the map to try, like, getting, like, pixel close to see, like, did I get this one? I don't know.
[47:22.510 --> 47:23.950]  It's, like, far bad. It's bad.
[47:24.550 --> 47:24.790]  Yep.
[47:25.410 --> 47:27.350]  Oh, hey, what's up, Gavin? How you doing?
[47:28.690 --> 47:29.630]  What's up, G-Dog?
[47:29.870 --> 47:36.150]  Uh, you know, Windows needs an update, and it seems to be a good time to do it when I'm using the computer.
[47:36.610 --> 47:38.010]  Well, yeah, when else would you do it?
[47:38.370 --> 47:38.610]  Yeah.
[47:38.610 --> 47:40.370]  I don't know. Yesterday? Christmas Day?
[47:41.210 --> 47:43.830]  Yeah, but you want to keep an eye on it and make sure.
[47:43.970 --> 47:44.510]  Make sure it goes okay.
[47:44.670 --> 47:46.510]  Yeah, what if it gets all fucked up?
[47:47.610 --> 47:49.670]  Oh, Geoff, did you find Michael's house?
[47:51.990 --> 47:53.610]  I don't know where Michael's house is.
[47:54.750 --> 47:55.830]  Oh, so I haven't gotten this one.
[48:00.040 --> 48:00.940]  Is it over here?
[48:01.480 --> 48:02.100]  Is this it?
[48:02.840 --> 48:04.820]  Every house looks the fucking same to me.
[48:05.460 --> 48:06.380]  I'm at 12 to 25.
[48:06.380 --> 48:14.140]  Wow, you are catching up, buddy, because I'm doing my best to cross-reference this map.
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.040]  It is not going well. I'm getting frustrated.
[48:18.100 --> 48:19.160]  Did you find it yet, Geoff?
[48:20.420 --> 48:21.940]  No, but isn't it around here?
[48:23.160 --> 48:25.280]  All the houses look like his house to me.
[48:30.040 --> 48:34.580]  It's really, like, once you're there, you'll know. It's not hidden at all.
[48:34.580 --> 48:36.000]  I look forward to that.
[48:36.480 --> 48:38.600]  Once you have the answer, you'll have the answer.
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.420]  I'm saying if you just run up and down the sidewalks of the various streets, you'll be bound to find it.
[48:45.640 --> 48:47.160]  You'll find every snowman, won't you?
[48:50.060 --> 48:52.820]  Guys, guys, Gavin's back.
[48:53.300 --> 48:55.540]  Hey, Gavin, I think you need to restart your attitude.
[48:55.860 --> 48:57.440]  Oh, I found it.
[48:58.700 --> 48:59.660]  Attitude needs an update.
[48:59.840 --> 49:00.360]  I think so.
[49:02.900 --> 49:03.680]  Okay, 14.
[49:04.180 --> 49:04.760]  There we go.
[49:04.820 --> 49:07.500]  Remember when I said I couldn't get sick of playing this game?
[49:07.520 --> 49:08.120]  Yeah, I remember that.
[49:08.900 --> 49:10.060]  Yeah, why? I remember that.
[49:11.380 --> 49:12.240]  Oh, shit, is it up here?
[49:13.400 --> 49:13.720]  Oh.
[49:13.940 --> 49:14.500]  He's back.
[49:15.320 --> 49:15.960]  I'm back in.
[49:16.080 --> 49:16.480]  You found it?
[49:16.860 --> 49:17.660]  It's gotta be around here.
[49:17.860 --> 49:18.060]  Yeah.
[49:18.740 --> 49:19.440]  Did you find his house?
[49:19.520 --> 49:20.180]  You found his house.
[49:22.580 --> 49:23.660]  Up in the damn gate.
[49:25.920 --> 49:28.260]  Oh, I was off by, like, a block and a half.
[49:28.800 --> 49:29.500]  Way to go, buddy.
[49:29.620 --> 49:32.000]  Should have just run around the streets.
[49:32.140 --> 49:32.300]  Yeah.
[49:32.300 --> 49:33.500]  Run around the sidewalks.
[49:33.560 --> 49:35.680]  Did you hear it? You must not have heard Andrew's advice.
[49:36.320 --> 49:38.420]  Wait, where is it, though?
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.120]  It said it's in the front yard.
[49:41.400 --> 49:45.280]  Okay, so if I'm on the west, I'll start working north and then come back.
[49:46.980 --> 49:47.520]  All right.
[49:48.220 --> 49:50.400]  All right, so what number will this be for you, Gavin?
[49:50.640 --> 49:50.940]  13.
[49:51.020 --> 49:51.780]  Oh, shit.
[49:52.240 --> 49:52.880]  I almost threw a grenade.
[49:53.280 --> 49:54.240]  Damn, you're at 13, Andrew.
[49:54.780 --> 49:55.700]  I'm at 13.
[49:55.940 --> 49:58.060]  Wow. I mean, you made a comeback. I'm at 14 right now.
[49:58.920 --> 49:59.280]  Shit.
[49:59.540 --> 50:00.160]  Why can't I pick up?
[50:00.160 --> 50:01.840]  I can't throw them while you're around.
[50:03.320 --> 50:04.040]  You can't?
[50:04.140 --> 50:04.820]  No, it's just like...
[50:04.820 --> 50:05.840]  Oh, because it locks onto it.
[50:06.900 --> 50:07.640]  All right, there we go.
[50:07.680 --> 50:08.600]  That's nine for me.
[50:08.740 --> 50:08.840]  Nine!
[50:09.120 --> 50:09.620]  Hey, way to go.
[50:09.740 --> 50:10.300]  All right.
[50:11.020 --> 50:12.000]  That's the city done.
[50:12.020 --> 50:14.240]  So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[50:14.360 --> 50:14.680]  Okay.
[50:15.260 --> 50:16.040]  Where to next?
[50:16.640 --> 50:16.860]  Uh-oh.
[50:17.060 --> 50:17.460]  Uh-oh.
[50:17.880 --> 50:18.800]  Oh, I got squirrely.
[50:19.260 --> 50:20.180]  Oh, the ocean.
[50:20.680 --> 50:21.040]  Uh-oh.
[50:21.800 --> 50:22.520]  Uh-oh.
[50:23.140 --> 50:23.540]  Oh, no.
[50:26.060 --> 50:27.440]  The beach is so snowy.
[50:27.460 --> 50:27.920]  It's nice.
[50:29.400 --> 50:30.200]  Oh, it's a snowy beach?
[50:30.280 --> 50:31.240]  Oh, it's a very snowy beach.
[50:31.240 --> 50:32.860]  Gotta love a snowy beach.
[50:33.280 --> 50:34.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:34.600 --> 50:36.620]  When you want to go there, I'm sure it's great.
[50:36.720 --> 50:38.820]  I don't want to be here, so it's not great for me.
[50:41.720 --> 50:42.840]  Whose police is this?
[50:42.960 --> 50:43.380]  Oh, they're mine.
[50:43.840 --> 50:45.280]  I just wanted to give you a warning level before I...
[50:50.180 --> 50:50.540]  Oh.
[50:51.680 --> 50:52.420]  We get out?
[50:53.580 --> 50:55.060]  We go from the damn gate.
[50:57.340 --> 50:58.000]  And we're off.
[50:59.420 --> 51:00.280]  Oh, I'm spinning.
[51:03.960 --> 51:07.040]  That cop, right before he got hit, went like...
[51:07.040 --> 51:10.940]  He did E-hands.
[51:11.680 --> 51:13.380]  What are E-hands?
[51:14.740 --> 51:17.780]  Okay, imagine someone with their hands going like...
[51:18.500 --> 51:20.300]  Okay, thanks. I got it now.
[51:20.980 --> 51:21.420]  You got it?
[51:21.420 --> 51:22.120]  Yeah, I got it.
[51:24.780 --> 51:26.940]  There is so much stuff in this fucking game.
[51:26.940 --> 51:28.660]  Just driving and it's like...
[51:29.120 --> 51:30.380]  This thing pops and it goes,
[51:30.480 --> 51:32.120]  Hey, explore the wilderness. Here's a question mark.
[51:32.400 --> 51:32.940]  It's like, I don't...
[51:34.400 --> 51:36.080]  I don't know anything about this, man.
[51:36.440 --> 51:37.280]  I'm trying to collect snow.
[51:38.820 --> 51:41.520]  Are you back into GTA again, Gavin, now that we found that snowman?
[51:41.860 --> 51:42.720]  Back in, baby.
[51:42.860 --> 51:43.320]  All right, good.
[51:44.740 --> 51:45.060]  Wow.
[51:46.260 --> 51:47.880]  Feel free to cut this if this shouldn't be in the video,
[51:47.980 --> 51:50.220]  but Gavin and I were talking yesterday about
[51:50.840 --> 51:53.440]  a thread on the old Achievement Hunter subreddit we were reading.
[51:54.860 --> 51:56.300]  Just about like...
[51:56.300 --> 51:59.340]  It's a sentiment I see over and over and over again.
[51:59.400 --> 52:00.540]  That was brilliant, by the way.
[52:01.060 --> 52:05.500]  That people just loved the routine of the Monday GTA.
[52:06.320 --> 52:07.340]  Well, of course. Yeah.
[52:09.500 --> 52:10.500]  They loved it.
[52:10.680 --> 52:12.080]  It was something I hadn't considered.
[52:12.180 --> 52:12.820]  Maybe I did at the time.
[52:12.900 --> 52:13.960]  I just don't remember considering it now,
[52:14.020 --> 52:16.120]  which was they loved the surprise and delight
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.440]  of they knew there was going to be GTA.
[52:17.560 --> 52:18.820]  They just had no idea what it would be.
[52:19.640 --> 52:19.840]  Yeah.
[52:21.480 --> 52:23.680]  Yeah, I mean, it totally makes sense.
[52:23.780 --> 52:24.260]  I get it.
[52:25.920 --> 52:29.000]  Gavin and I were talking about maybe just doing more GTA in 2025
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.460]  and Gavin had a great name.
[52:31.160 --> 52:33.300]  I had a bad name and Gavin came up with a good name.
[52:33.360 --> 52:34.100]  Okay, wait, hang on.
[52:34.260 --> 52:35.120]  I want to...
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.800]  Don't say whose name was what, but give us both names.
[52:38.840 --> 52:39.420]  I'll tell you what.
[52:39.520 --> 52:41.700]  I'll type them in the chat.
[52:41.880 --> 52:42.240]  Oh, yeah.
[52:43.960 --> 52:45.300]  You put them in our chat.
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.400]  Andrew, do you want to read them when we have them?
[52:48.500 --> 52:49.820]  I would love to read them.
[52:49.840 --> 52:50.060]  Okay.
[52:51.000 --> 52:51.680]  Wait.
[52:51.780 --> 52:52.740]  Wait till the other one's there.
[52:52.940 --> 52:53.180]  Yeah, I'm waiting.
[52:53.540 --> 52:53.720]  Okay.
[52:54.880 --> 52:55.280]  Okay.
[52:56.320 --> 52:57.000]  Saps...
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  Sapsarilla.
[52:58.460 --> 53:00.120]  Okay, scroll down, you fuck.
[53:03.080 --> 53:04.680]  202 GTA 5.
[53:05.240 --> 53:05.820]  2020 GTA 5.
[53:05.840 --> 53:08.040]  Oh, like 2020 GTA 5.
[53:08.100 --> 53:08.300]  Okay.
[53:09.900 --> 53:10.920]  202 V.
[53:11.000 --> 53:12.200]  Or 2020 V.
[53:12.280 --> 53:12.700]  2025.
[53:14.640 --> 53:15.680]  202 V.
[53:16.200 --> 53:18.680]  Or 202 GTA 5.
[53:19.840 --> 53:20.640]  The second one is better.
[53:21.040 --> 53:21.320]  Yeah.
[53:22.180 --> 53:25.480]  I thought it'd be funny just to put like a post on our social media.
[53:25.880 --> 53:27.100]  And it just says 20...
[53:27.100 --> 53:31.060]  And the 5 is the V from the GTA 5 logo.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.280]  And just to see if people could figure out what we're doing.
[53:35.280 --> 53:35.820]  I like it.
[53:37.480 --> 53:39.860]  It does a little bit look like 202 volts.
[53:40.860 --> 53:42.180]  A little bit, yeah.
[53:42.620 --> 53:45.020]  It doesn't look as bad as the word salad that is...
[53:46.240 --> 53:47.700]  Oh, I found it.
[53:48.960 --> 53:49.980]  The number 5.
[53:51.840 --> 53:52.600]  Did you say you found it yet?
[53:52.680 --> 53:53.360]  I just killed that man.
[53:53.540 --> 53:53.760]  No.
[53:54.100 --> 53:55.600]  I found one.
[53:56.160 --> 53:56.720]  That I was looking for.
[53:56.880 --> 53:57.280]  16.
[53:59.600 --> 54:02.880]  Camp 3 won the stolen vehicle challenge with a score of 1.
[54:02.980 --> 54:04.180]  Yeah, I don't know what that was.
[54:04.340 --> 54:05.040]  What was that?
[54:05.380 --> 54:06.700]  Oh, this happens from time to time.
[54:07.240 --> 54:09.240]  The game will just say, hey, in two minutes...
[54:09.240 --> 54:09.420]  I found it.
[54:09.920 --> 54:10.540]  Geoff is here.
[54:10.780 --> 54:11.320]  Alright, I'm coming.
[54:11.320 --> 54:15.820]  They'll be like, hey, in two minutes, there's going to be a steal the best car you...
[54:15.820 --> 54:16.980]  The most valuable car you can.
[54:17.360 --> 54:18.420]  And then whoever steals the best...
[54:18.420 --> 54:18.940]  No, I didn't mean to do that.
[54:19.560 --> 54:20.060]  God damn it.
[54:20.100 --> 54:21.880]  I just am stealing a Hummer.
[54:22.260 --> 54:22.400]  No.
[54:24.460 --> 54:24.900]  1.
[54:25.400 --> 54:25.740]  2.
[54:25.920 --> 54:26.460]  Get it off.
[54:26.740 --> 54:27.060]  No.
[54:27.780 --> 54:29.340]  Where am I looking?
[54:29.580 --> 54:31.160]  It disappeared and I...
[54:31.160 --> 54:31.220]  What the fuck?
[54:31.220 --> 54:32.120]  Did I get credit for it?
[54:32.700 --> 54:33.700]  Is yours disappeared?
[54:34.500 --> 54:36.100]  Yeah, but I got 10 out of 25.
[54:36.420 --> 54:37.640]  Mine didn't pop up like that.
[54:38.520 --> 54:39.280]  Oh, no.
[54:39.900 --> 54:40.420]  Let me...
[54:40.420 --> 54:40.860]  I got to...
[54:40.860 --> 54:41.000]  Hold on.
[54:41.100 --> 54:41.840]  I'm not going to get in, Gavin.
[54:41.860 --> 54:43.940]  I'm going to stay here and let him kill me and I'm going to look at my...
[54:43.940 --> 54:44.140]  Alright.
[54:44.820 --> 54:46.340]  Boy, what the...
[54:46.340 --> 54:47.380]  Got to be like here.
[54:47.520 --> 54:47.940]  Where am I in the map?
[54:47.940 --> 54:48.940]  Yeah, mine says nine.
[54:49.240 --> 54:50.120]  So, I think that's...
[54:50.120 --> 54:50.220]  Oh, shit.
[54:50.460 --> 54:51.780]  I got a problem.
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.200]  This game just hates you for some reason.
[54:55.640 --> 54:56.380]  Like, I saw you...
[54:56.380 --> 54:57.360]  Yeah, I hit it twice.
[54:57.480 --> 54:58.440]  Then you destroyed it.
[55:00.820 --> 55:01.460]  Challenge over.
[55:02.020 --> 55:04.440]  Gavin won the vehicle stolen challenge with a score of one.
[55:04.540 --> 55:05.060]  Way to go, dude.
[55:06.220 --> 55:06.720]  Oh, man.
[55:06.760 --> 55:09.340]  I hope the game didn't just fuck me out of this...
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.200]  Wait, did I say I had ten?
[55:13.700 --> 55:13.920]  Yeah.
[55:14.480 --> 55:16.060]  Oh, I've done mine in a stupid order.
[55:16.240 --> 55:17.280]  That's going to confuse me later.
[55:17.560 --> 55:17.840]  Uh-oh.
[55:19.980 --> 55:21.500]  Move, you old bastards!
[55:23.880 --> 55:28.520]  I'm at sixteen, trying to work my way north to south here.
[55:29.200 --> 55:30.540]  Finally, instead of going left and right.
[55:33.460 --> 55:34.360]  What's up, buddy?
[55:36.760 --> 55:39.880]  When we've all got our snowman suits, should we all take a big selfie
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.700]  and send it to Nick?
[55:40.740 --> 55:41.160]  Oh, definitely.
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.500]  Send it to me, because I won't have one, because I'm already about to get fucked out of this one.
[55:47.960 --> 55:53.300]  One day, we've got to go back through GTA and get you, Geoff, all of the shit that you've been screwed out of.
[55:53.720 --> 55:54.640]  And do the heists.
[55:56.100 --> 55:57.760]  Like, it's all limited stuff.
[56:00.020 --> 56:00.640]  Oh, that's fair.
[56:01.880 --> 56:02.700]  Maybe I do.
[56:03.120 --> 56:04.640]  No, it only says nine in the collector.
[56:05.720 --> 56:08.620]  Maybe we could just ask Rockstar to give it to you.
[56:08.620 --> 56:09.800]  I heard that.
[56:10.340 --> 56:10.720]  I'm good.
[56:14.380 --> 56:15.180]  Where'd that go?
[56:15.680 --> 56:16.540]  I'm not even close.
[56:17.020 --> 56:17.300]  What?
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.020]  It would be story of my fucking life that, uh...
[56:21.020 --> 56:23.760]  No, that's definitely what's going to happen. I'm definitely going to get fucked out of this, right?
[56:24.760 --> 56:25.200]  Yeah.
[56:25.440 --> 56:28.680]  This is going to be a really good selfie of the three of us in our snowman suits.
[56:28.680 --> 56:31.920]  It's gone, and I can't get it, and I don't have it.
[56:32.260 --> 56:34.020]  Maybe just remember that one and come back to it.
[56:34.500 --> 56:35.220]  Hey, what?
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.420]  What are you doing? You got Gronk again?
[56:38.800 --> 56:41.620]  No, no, there's a truck, and it's dropping stuff on the highway.
[56:41.800 --> 56:44.720]  I heard jingle, like, the sleigh bells.
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.000]  Yeah, it's part of the event.
[56:46.380 --> 56:46.740]  What?
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.000]  Okay, well, change of plans. I'm not doing the thing I was doing before.
[56:50.120 --> 56:52.900]  I'm following the fucking Christmas truck. Stuff is falling out of the back.
[56:54.040 --> 56:54.540]  I just got a sweater.
[56:54.540 --> 56:57.500]  Yeah, it throws a gift out every once in a while, and it gives you...
[56:57.500 --> 57:00.220]  There are two clothing items you can get and cash.
[57:00.560 --> 57:02.700]  How are you getting all these events? I'm not seeing shit.
[57:02.780 --> 57:05.020]  I'm just the blue truck on your mini-map.
[57:05.020 --> 57:08.360]  Yeah, I just hopped around. I was just going, and all of a sudden, I'm like,
[57:08.400 --> 57:12.300]  I'm not even close to my location. How is there jingle bells?
[57:12.700 --> 57:13.480]  And then...
[57:13.480 --> 57:15.300]  It's from this. Do I have to, like, hit it or something?
[57:15.440 --> 57:17.860]  No, it just takes a long time between each one.
[57:18.120 --> 57:20.280]  Oh, then I'm out of here. I already got it.
[57:20.360 --> 57:24.360]  I say I'm not seeing a lot of this stuff. I don't think I ever look at any icon on the map.
[57:24.360 --> 57:24.420]  Yeah.
[57:24.520 --> 57:25.280]  So maybe that's my problem.
[57:25.280 --> 57:25.700]  Yeah, it might do it.
[57:25.700 --> 57:26.920]  I've been avoiding content.
[57:27.500 --> 57:29.720]  Oh, Doobie Brothers.
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.000]  Oh, a simian vehicle.
[57:40.840 --> 57:44.020]  You'd think that he would have enough cars after 11 years of doing this.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.600]  No way, baby. It's a job for life.
[57:46.340 --> 57:50.080]  I want to find out how many cars Simian has had off the planet.
[57:54.280 --> 57:57.660]  All right, well, I got this one. Will it be number 10?
[57:57.840 --> 58:00.440]  Oh, God, I don't know if this car is going to last much longer.
[58:00.960 --> 58:02.800]  Oh, shit. This could be it for me.
[58:03.360 --> 58:04.580]  I've done really good so far.
[58:04.620 --> 58:08.960]  Yeah, you're right. I stole a Hummer, and it is so much easier to drive around.
[58:08.960 --> 58:12.240]  Like, when you find a car that can, like, really make it work.
[58:12.980 --> 58:13.700]  Oh, you're humming?
[58:14.380 --> 58:14.900]  I'm humming.
[58:15.120 --> 58:15.880]  All right, let me count them.
[58:16.620 --> 58:16.980]  17.
[58:17.080 --> 58:21.440]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[58:22.320 --> 58:23.260]  Yes, I'm fucked.
[58:24.640 --> 58:25.300]  Maybe it's...
[58:25.300 --> 58:26.760]  Okay, so it's got to be...
[58:27.220 --> 58:28.080]  Oh, it's got to be right here.
[58:28.220 --> 58:29.060]  Go back to it, maybe.
[58:32.480 --> 58:34.980]  Yeah, Eric, go and chase the truck so we can catch up.
[58:35.320 --> 58:38.200]  I did. I got a sweater.
[58:38.200 --> 58:38.860]  16.
[58:40.860 --> 58:42.540]  And we made some dumb videos in this game.
[58:42.600 --> 58:45.820]  Remember when we were all pretending to be Santa, throwing bombs down people's chimneys?
[58:49.720 --> 58:50.080]  Yeah.
[58:50.680 --> 58:51.460]  That's pretty cool.
[58:52.440 --> 58:53.800]  Love an open-world game.
[58:55.300 --> 58:58.580]  Yeah, we feel like we use so little of the actual game.
[58:59.840 --> 59:04.980]  We don't know much about GTA 6 yet or whatever, but, like, the online isn't coming at the same time, is it?
[59:05.000 --> 59:06.180]  Dude, we don't know much about GTA 5.
[59:09.300 --> 59:10.760]  Yeah, it'll just be single-player.
[59:12.140 --> 59:13.820]  I've played GTA 6.
[59:14.180 --> 59:15.180]  Oh, it's back!
[59:17.420 --> 59:18.860]  You've played GTA 6?
[59:21.320 --> 59:21.760]  No.
[59:22.400 --> 59:22.720]  Okay.
[59:25.060 --> 59:25.500]  NDA.
[59:25.920 --> 59:26.360]  Got it.
[59:27.780 --> 59:30.080]  I'd love to talk about it, but I can't.
[59:30.240 --> 59:30.960]  That'd be so cool.
[59:31.460 --> 59:33.760]  Alright, I got my missing one. It came back.
[59:33.960 --> 59:34.260]  Nice!
[59:34.520 --> 59:34.960]  Oh, nice.
[59:35.240 --> 59:35.720]  I'm back in the game.
[59:36.060 --> 59:37.520]  Hell yeah. Thank you, GTA 4.
[59:37.520 --> 59:38.760]  There it is. Fuck yeah.
[59:40.400 --> 59:41.260]  God damn it.
[59:41.940 --> 59:42.680]  A good guess.
[59:48.030 --> 59:48.990]  18 and...
[59:48.990 --> 59:49.730]  Is this a flare?
[59:52.030 --> 59:53.050]  Ooh, investigate it.
[59:53.150 --> 59:56.950]  I wish there was a way for us to see each other's maps.
[59:57.130 --> 01:00:00.630]  Like, just a top-down map view of where we all went at various times.
[01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:01.010]  Yeah.
[01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.850]  How we crossed.
[01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:02.250]  Yeah.
[01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:04.150]  I've investigated the flare.
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.670]  What if you snowball a woman's dog?
[01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.830]  I tried to snowball a cat earlier.
[01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:11.370]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:12.950]  I mean, he can, I think.
[01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.850]  It's just...
[01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:14.650]  Oh, it lived. It's fine.
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:15.530]  It's fine.
[01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:17.810]  Okay, so it's gotta be around here.
[01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:21.670]  Shit, I just accidentally drove over a snowman. It counted.
[01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:22.930]  Did it really? Cool.
[01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.270]  Yeah.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.190]  Oh, see, we've just been throwing snowballs for no reason.
[01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:28.290]  I don't think...
[01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.570]  It appears to be that way, yeah.
[01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:31.150]  God damn it.
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:33.390]  Oh, another flare.
[01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:35.650]  You better investigate.
[01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:36.850]  I'm going to.
[01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.950]  This is the first time I've ever run into it a second time.
[01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:40.430]  It's gone.
[01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:42.210]  The first time I've seen it a second time.
[01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:43.970]  It is. It's true.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.130]  Oh, wow. It's really, it's over there.
[01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:47.250]  Wow. Okay.
[01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.810]  Where's this damn snowman?
[01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.470]  Which one are you looking for, Gavin?
[01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.570]  I don't know.
[01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.750]  Cool.
[01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.790]  Awesome.
[01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:02.510]  Oh, I found it.
[01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:03.650]  Holy shit, I see it.
[01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.890]  Thanks, Geoff.
[01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:05.930]  No problem.
[01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.490]  Okay, flare.
[01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:11.590]  Got the flare.
[01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:12.410]  Where's the next one?
[01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:14.150]  Oh, it's over there.
[01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.370]  Yeah, you can totally run those over.
[01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.730]  I tried to hit a rabbit, and that didn't let me run it over.
[01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:22.570]  I'm investigating these flares now.
[01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:23.810]  I'm over snowmen.
[01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:25.970]  I'm a flare guy now.
[01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.450]  Yeah, you're a flare guy?
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:27.770]  Yeah.
[01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:28.970]  He's a flareman.
[01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.030]  I'm a flareman.
[01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.630]  What if it's just the snowman at the end of the flares?
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.730]  Holy shit.
[01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:33.690]  That would be awesome.
[01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:34.710]  I'm on 12.
[01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.670]  Nice, way to go.
[01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:38.590]  So you have 12, or you're on number 12?
[01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.730]  I have 12.
[01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.670]  Nice, dude.
[01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:48.130]  This car was not built for what I'm doing with it.
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.130]  I thought you were humming.
[01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:50.550]  That's him.
[01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:50.850]  I'm humming.
[01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.390]  That's the other one.
[01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.150]  Oh, other one.
[01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:56.350]  I'm in like a McLaren.
[01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:58.170]  It's just...
[01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:59.110]  Now I'm off-road.
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:00.890]  Which number are you?
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.550]  What?
[01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.610]  Like if everyone in regulation had a number.
[01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.890]  Oh.
[01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.870]  Which one are you?
[01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.850]  I'm five.
[01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:14.030]  Is this a red versus blue thing?
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:15.490]  What?
[01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:16.150]  Yeah, I'm caboose.
[01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.470]  They all had numbers, didn't they?
[01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.710]  Oh.
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:19.290]  I'm donut.
[01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:20.850]  Which one's donut?
[01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:22.650]  Double zero, I think.
[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.670]  Cool.
[01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:24.630]  Double O donut.
[01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:26.690]  Is it?
[01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:28.130]  No, no, no, no, I want to go up there!
[01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:30.470]  Geoff had two numbers.
[01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:32.090]  Geoff, do you have two numbers?
[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:33.730]  Yeah, because I'm a fucking idiot.
[01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:35.770]  Well, that's cool.
[01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:40.110]  I thought it would be funny to be 69 and then I would grow up.
[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.690]  Yeah.
[01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:41.290]  Oh.
[01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.650]  That sounds right.
[01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:45.150]  I can't believe you changed it.
[01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.370]  Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?
[01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.510]  I don't know.
[01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:49.530]  What is it the second time?
[01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:50.210]  22.
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:52.550]  Oh.
[01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:55.610]  An equally funny number, dude.
[01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:56.170]  Hell yeah.
[01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:58.850]  It was just an homage to that band I used to root for.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.230]  Oh, try my pork whistle!
[01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.650]  He's got a hot dog!
[01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.710]  There's a hot dog at GTA!
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.550]  It's awesome!
[01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.310]  What?
[01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:08.490]  Is that a pork whistle?
[01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:09.890]  There's a big...
[01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:11.510]  There's a big...
[01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:14.650]  Like a barn or a house and on the back of it is a giant...
[01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:16.850]  Like a pig...
[01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:17.650]  With a...
[01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.250]  What do you call it?
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:21.650]  An apron on that says try my pork whistle and he's holding a hot dog.
[01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:23.050]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:23.530]  Yeah.
[01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.110]  Are you gonna add that to the list?
[01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.010]  I had a hard time getting that out for some reason.
[01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.490]  Ah, train!
[01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.670]  Train!
[01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:33.190]  Hey, soul sister!
[01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.530]  Drops of Jupiter everywhere.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.720]  Am I going the right way?
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.120]  I need to get back on the actual road.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.160]  Okay, this is right.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:46.860]  Okay, we're good.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.160]  Back on my snowman tip.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.220]  Oh, this car is...
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:52.760]  Second floor lead anywhere?
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.600]  Yeah, I got a smuggler's cash.
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.920]  I got like $20,000 and some...
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.900]  Oh, you can raid some stash houses every day?
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.520]  Yeah.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.560]  There's a lot of stuff we're not doing here, Gavin.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.540]  We should start a series called Let's Play GTA 5.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.800]  And we just play the game.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.360]  Yeah, we're just playing GTA 5.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.460]  Once we complete the heist, I have so many just things on my map.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.060]  That was my thought of like, we should just do all the things.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.120]  Oh, I love that.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.480]  And if that's the case, then maybe Geoff can play.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:26.720]  That'd be great.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.760]  That'd be a part of our new show, 202 volts.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:29.560]  Yeah.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.980]  Oh, there's a snowman.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:37.260]  Alright, this will be number 12.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.480]  It's gotta be over here.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.160]  This car is clanking.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:42.660]  No!
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.320]  It's another flare.
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.360]  I don't want to do another flare.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.100]  Oh, that's a car that I could drive in snow in.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.340]  Where are you at?
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.560]  Where are you hiding?
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.420]  Oh no, that's water!
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.860]  Bullets don't seem to fuck them up.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:00.560]  Brake! Brake! Brake!
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.700]  Oh, there it is.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.160]  Ooh, I wonder if I can just drive into it from here.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.700]  Oh no, I killed my car.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.340]  I'm not humming anymore.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:10.800]  I hit it!
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:11.700]  19!
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:13.220]  Nice.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.660]  Alright, 12 for Geoff.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.560]  Way to go, Geoff!
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.320]  Oh my god, am I like really getting back...
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:19.960]  Oh shit, Chris was trapped!
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.420]  I'm like getting back into the city, kind of.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.900]  What'd I do? I just blowed up?
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:24.160]  Kind of.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.880]  Oh no, no, you just follow it.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.820]  Stuff drops.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.320]  Oh, I got snacks and 9200 bucks?
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:31.400]  Nice!
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.120]  9200 bucks is a lot.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.700]  Yeah, think about how much ammo you can get for your minigun with that.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:38.720]  Like, none.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.060]  How often does it drop a gift?
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.580]  I didn't see it drop a second one.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:42.960]  Oh.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:43.980]  It just dropped one for me.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.020]  You might want to keep following it though to find out.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.480]  I'm gonna need to steal, I mean borrow your car, sir.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.160]  You apologize for the inconvenience.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:01.360]  Oh god, I'm stuck in the trees!
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.240]  Are you like a bird, Andrew?
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.260]  I wish.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.800]  You only fly away?
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.960]  I want to know where my home is.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.940]  My wife hates that song.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.500]  That and Last Christmas, she hates those songs.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.200]  Really?
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:17.860]  Yeah.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.220]  Is she like, uh, Wonderful Christmas Time?
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.520]  The good song, yes.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.100]  Love that song.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:26.500]  It's a great song.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:27.500]  It's a great song.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.260]  It's a great song.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:28.780]  It's a great song.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.420]  How dare you?
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:29.980]  Come on.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.640]  Is she like the movie, Last Christmas?
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.460]  I don't think...
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:37.660]  No, I think she saw it, like, saw what it was and was like, this fucking sucks.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.560]  So don't blame her, you know?
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.040]  Why am I getting chased by hillbillies?
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:47.140]  I could fucking snowball you, man!
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.720]  Fucking eat shit!
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.740]  Story of Andrew's life, living in Vancouver Island.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.160]  They're calling me a dickhole, you're trying to fight... I just ran by!
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.880]  Oh, I'm stealing your dickhead truck.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:58.340]  I hear it.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.320]  That's all I'm doing.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.780]  Fucking dickheads.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.020]  Oh, there it is.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.820]  Oh, now you can be pissed at me.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.160]  Oh, this is such a dickhead truck.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.840]  No, hijacking... Oh, he's throwing me out of it!
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.240]  Stop kicking me!
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.280]  Andrew's getting alpha mailed.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.700]  Snowball!
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.800]  Geoff, do you have this one I'm on right now?
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.100]  Oh no! It didn't give it to me!
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.020]  I don't know where you are.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:23.260]  What?
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.940]  I ran over it and it didn't say any number. God damn it, I got Geoffed!
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.020]  Yeah, be careful of getting Geoffed. It ain't funny.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:30.880]  Oh, suck!
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.280]  Is it maybe over toward the... silo?
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.240]  You don't see me on the map?
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.240]  Oh no, I'm sorry, I was helping Geoff out. Where are you?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.460]  I was helping Geoff out!
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.040]  I'm over here, I'm helping Geoff out.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.340]  I haven't done that one yet, Gavin.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:46.720]  Okay.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.620]  That one screwed me, so I'll be back.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.540]  God, did I get this one? I don't think I got this one.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.340]  Well, Andrew, I guess we're going to see each other in just a second.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.280]  Yeah? Oh, we're crossing?
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.700]  I'm trying to get over... I mean, I'm going over to where you are because I think that's where I need to get one.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:11.600]  I feel like this has kind of got to be where this snowman is. Would it be like up front of your house or something, guys? Like, where would you put it?
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:12.700]  Excuse me!
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.300]  Oh, this dickhead truck is cruising through the snow.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:19.640]  That's cool.
[01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:25.950]  You just came from one, right, Andrew?
[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:26.390]  Yep.
[01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.990]  Man, this kind of makes me want to get a truck in real life.
[01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:34.850]  To do what? To look at it?
[01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:37.810]  No, to be it. To be it.
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:39.850]  You want to be a truck?
[01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:42.690]  So you want Meg to drive you around in a truck?
[01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:43.650]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.570]  That's weird.
[01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:53.390]  Alright, I'm not going to run anymore over because that one screwed me.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.020]  I'm going for a try and true snowboard.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:00.560]  Are you at 20?
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.400]  I'm at 20.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:02.660]  Nice, man.
[01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:10.310]  I feel like I already got this one. I'm...
[01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:11.190]  Uh-oh.
[01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:13.110]  I'm starting to... Guys, I'm starting to get confused.
[01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.270]  It's not good.
[01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:17.710]  Uh-oh.
[01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:19.190]  Uh-oh, boys.
[01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:23.250]  You're like me and my... I've flown under 49 of the 50 bridges.
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:25.590]  Oh, man.
[01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:27.330]  Ah, snowman.
[01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:30.190]  So I'm not going to run it over because...
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.330]  Yeah, I'm scared now because of what happened to Gavin.
[01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:37.330]  Learn from Gavin.
[01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:39.790]  Well, I'll just learn from Geoff.
[01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.550]  Man, I diamonded my shotguns this morning in GTA, or in Call of Duty.
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:44.330]  I'm getting so close.
[01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:44.710]  Way to go.
[01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:45.750]  You got the headshots?
[01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:51.250]  Yeah, I decided I'm going to go for Dark Matter, which is like diamonding every gun in the game.
[01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.270]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:53.430]  Pretty much.
[01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:54.070]  Yeah.
[01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:56.770]  How many guns do you have left?
[01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:59.270]  I have the Diamond 33, and I've...
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.590]  Okay.
[01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.950]  ...gunned, or have the ability to do nine. So, not too terribly.
[01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:05.890]  Is that just done with kills, or just using it?
[01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:08.130]  Yeah, kills. Certain kinds of kills.
[01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:13.150]  You have to get 100 headshots with every weapon, and then you have to do like 10 triple kills in a row, or...
[01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:13.950]  Oh, boy.
[01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:16.490]  ...50 point blank shots, or like whatever.
[01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:17.190]  Just in multiplayer?
[01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:18.130]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:21.170]  Or, I mean, it counts Warzone, and wherever you can use the gun.
[01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:23.490]  He got here?
[01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.870]  21.
[01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.670]  Damn, Andrew took the lead.
[01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:29.350]  Andrew's going to take it right at the end.
[01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:29.950]  Yep.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.490]  He is. I got so confused, like...
[01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:34.930]  Well, you were doing a bunch of side missions, too.
[01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.570]  Yeah, I started chasing flares. It was pretty cool.
[01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:44.490]  After Andrew wins, or Eric, you know, or Eric, it's not over.
[01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:45.410]  Yeah, something like that.
[01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:47.910]  Probably not Gavin or Geoff.
[01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:54.790]  But after y'all win, should we group up and then finish lighting them off for everybody, or just like hang out?
[01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:58.410]  Yeah, no, we can't. I'm totally down for that. I just don't know how to...
[01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.050]  I don't know how to know which ones you need to do.
[01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:03.010]  We're barely an hour and a half into this video, you know. We got another two hours to go, probably.
[01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:03.510]  Barely.
[01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.910]  I mean, my audio recording's much shorter.
[01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:10.130]  Yeah, we'll definitely have to do a tail sync at the end.
[01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:11.190]  Alright, 21.
[01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:19.270]  So when you and I split up, Gavin, at that place you went left and I went right.
[01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:23.130]  Did you just get 21, Eric?
[01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:26.130]  Yeah, I just got 21. No, I just got 21.
[01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.990]  What do you have, Andrew?
[01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.750]  It's gotta be over here.
[01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.590]  I'm at 21.
[01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.690]  He's at 21 also.
[01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:36.230]  But I think the last ones that I need are like... I don't think any of them are close to each other.
[01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:40.590]  I think I'm like very spread out.
[01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:46.130]  I'm getting what I feel is the toughest of the four I have left.
[01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.850]  Oh, nice.
[01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:50.090]  And what do you base that off of?
[01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.130]  Just its remoteness.
[01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:54.750]  And the... yeah.
[01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.550]  He's a vibes connoisseur.
[01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.090]  Yeah. We know this about me.
[01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:05.090]  Are there... have you guys run into any that aren't like by a house or by... you know what I mean?
[01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:07.670]  Not really. They're like in a house or in a park.
[01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:11.770]  Like they're pretty... like one of them's in like a backyard.
[01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:16.050]  And that was like the hardest one for me to find, I think.
[01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:20.370]  Like wandering around the area trying to find it.
[01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:24.270]  They're where they would make sense, not like...
[01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:25.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:28.610]  They definitely... they're not like, oh, this one's upside down in the garage.
[01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.950]  No, they're all... it's all pretty straightforward.
[01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:43.330]  That's what... when I'm like... the way I found these so quickly was looking at this shitty fucking map and then going, okay, what on there looks like a yard where it would be?
[01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:46.850]  It's just been that.
[01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:48.330]  22.
[01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:50.090]  Ooh, dang.
[01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:52.430]  Like I'm at this trail... ah, there you are.
[01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:53.430]  Mudang.
[01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:55.030]  Mudang.
[01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:59.570]  Dynasty Warrior?
[01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.430]  22.
[01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:03.310]  Nice.
[01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:05.470]  And then Brucie called me.
[01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:06.350]  This might end up being pretty close.
[01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:07.210]  14.
[01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.470]  Why did Brucie call me?
[01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:08.990]  Alright.
[01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:11.130]  Okay.
[01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.270]  God, now I'm all the way over here.
[01:13:14.610 --> 01:13:14.910]  Oh.
[01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.850]  Who's that?
[01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:16.810]  It's almost two miles.
[01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:19.310]  Geoff, Geoff, that's... are you right where the snowman is?
[01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.510]  Shit, yeah.
[01:13:20.410 --> 01:13:21.970]  That's exactly where I'm going next, I think.
[01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.570]  Oh, good luck.
[01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:24.130]  Thanks, man.
[01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:27.470]  God, it's a long drive from where I am.
[01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:28.750]  Where's the one that's by the grapes?
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.610]  Hmm?
[01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:31.850]  What?
[01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:32.430]  What?
[01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:33.250]  Is there a grapes one?
[01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.530]  Dude, you know about grapes, right?
[01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:37.290]  Yeah, why are you asking this?
[01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.170]  I've known...
[01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:38.430]  Yeah, man.
[01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:39.170]  You're the grape guy.
[01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:40.590]  People fucking love grapes.
[01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.190]  Yeah.
[01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:42.550]  So you're your whole personality.
[01:13:43.150 --> 01:13:44.290]  Yeah, it's like your whole thing, right?
[01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.610]  Yeah.
[01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:47.870]  People love grapes, dogs hate grapes.
[01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.670]  You're just a grapes guy.
[01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:51.870]  Can we put out a shirt that says, uh, people have opinions about grapes?
[01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.210]  Guys, we're going to be millionaires.
[01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:59.250]  Apple shirt, but it's a purple shirt.
[01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:02.370]  How about it says people comma grapes in it?
[01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:05.370]  How did we never do that one?
[01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:15.670]  I like the way we've been doing merch where we're like sort of like thoughtful in what we're releasing next and all this stuff.
[01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:20.350]  I do think it will be a time where we're going like, you know what, it's time for five shirts right now.
[01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:24.170]  And we are going to have an idea for five shirts right now.
[01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:25.910]  Like, it really feels like that's going to happen.
[01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:30.790]  But there'll be good new ideas, not a rehash of something I said eight years ago.
[01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.630]  Oh, no, we're rehashing the grapes.
[01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.490]  We're definitely rehashing the grapes one.
[01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:35.510]  We got to make it.
[01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.130]  Dude, we got to pay the bills, Gavin.
[01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:39.410]  We need one grape shirt.
[01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:40.090]  Sorry, dude.
[01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:41.350]  Yeah, first it's that.
[01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:42.490]  Then we're doing Mark Nutt.
[01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:44.590]  Oh, shit!
[01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:46.590]  Bring it back, fish, baby.
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.210]  23.
[01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:48.930]  I just accidentally hit one.
[01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:49.950]  Oh, nice.
[01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:53.670]  Should we do a show that says grapes aren't keen on people?
[01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:55.970]  Grapes hate people.
[01:14:57.610 --> 01:14:58.830]  Grapes don't like people.
[01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:09.090]  Man, I've been eating this grape dessert lately that is so fucking good.
[01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:10.190]  Grape dessert?
[01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:17.270]  Yeah, it's this thing that Costco has where they take grapes and they put like sour candy.
[01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.610]  Oh!
[01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:20.490]  Sugar on them or whatever that is.
[01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:21.030]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:23.770]  And this is in a big bag, shook up, and it's frozen.
[01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:24.870]  It's so good.
[01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:25.550]  Yeah, I've seen those too.
[01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:27.390]  Because they're just grapes, right?
[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.070]  Yeah, just grapes.
[01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:30.350]  It's just grapes with a little bit of...
[01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.810]  It's just grapes.
[01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:32.450]  It's like frozen grapes that are sour.
[01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:33.210]  It's so good.
[01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:33.430]  Yeah.
[01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:35.110]  I'm a big frozen grapes guy.
[01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:36.110]  It's like the only way I'll eat them.
[01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:37.970]  Are they called just grapes?
[01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:40.690]  That's just grape.
[01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.110]  Yeah, that's what they're called.
[01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:44.170]  Oh, there it is.
[01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:45.450]  23.
[01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:46.210]  Three.
[01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.430]  Oh, you goddamn piece of garbage.
[01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:50.270]  All right.
[01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:51.890]  Well, no need to be mean.
[01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:53.210]  No, not you.
[01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:54.590]  No!
[01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:55.890]  It sounded like it was directed at Eric.
[01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:56.570]  No!
[01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:57.030]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:57.610]  What'd I do?
[01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:59.010]  Goddamn it.
[01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:00.470]  Andrew doesn't like to lose.
[01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:01.750]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:02.490]  Jeez, dude.
[01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:04.370]  It's been a thing we've been dealing with for a long time.
[01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:05.490]  I'm trying to get something else.
[01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:08.570]  I'm trying to do the Eric flair type thing, but not a flair.
[01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:09.010]  Oh, are you?
[01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.490]  Where's the snowman and the grapes?
[01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.890]  Oh, dude.
[01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.590]  A.A.
[01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.430]  Geoff, I found an A.A.
[01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:18.410]  Oh, thanks, man.
[01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:19.970]  If you could mark that on the map for me.
[01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:21.410]  No, not that kind of A.A.
[01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:22.790]  What do you call it?
[01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:24.450]  Ah, I did it.
[01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:27.770]  You remember when we were driving around in...
[01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.970]  Oh.
[01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:29.290]  It gotta be that.
[01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:30.310]  We were driving around.
[01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:34.690]  We were driving around in GTA 4, trying to find someone working on their car so we could
[01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.030]  help them.
[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:36.630]  Oh, AAA.
[01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:37.210]  That's pretty funny.
[01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:37.770]  AAA.
[01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.450]  Yeah.
[01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:39.670]  That was a good one.
[01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:39.770]  That was a good one.
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.470]  That was a good one.
[01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.050]  That was the hot fire hydrant popper.
[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:43.990]  Yeah.
[01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:45.650]  I'm at 50.
[01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:47.450]  Nice.
[01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:48.470]  So look out, Andrew.
[01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:49.470]  I'm so mad.
[01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:51.210]  How you doing, Andrew?
[01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:56.630]  I'm trying to get a collectible thing for a different collectible and...
[01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.790]  Yeah.
[01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:58.650]  I get it.
[01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:00.850]  What else you collecting, man?
[01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:02.870]  Movie props.
[01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:04.110]  What?
[01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.150]  Is this in GTA?
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.650]  What?
[01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:07.570]  In GTA.
[01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:08.810]  What's that for?
[01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:13.350]  It's some other random mission thing.
[01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.730]  Oh.
[01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:15.790]  But it's a car.
[01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:18.490]  It's a vehicle that has a movie prop in the back of it.
[01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:23.250]  And I stopped it and then some random pedestrian ran me over.
[01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.350]  Sounds like Andrew's doing one of your heists again.
[01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.970]  Movie prop equipment and DJ equipment.
[01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.390]  There we go.
[01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.910]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:34.710]  This is part of the heist.
[01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:35.950]  Oh, this wasn't part of the heist.
[01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:36.610]  Oh, this.
[01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.330]  Now this is part of the heist.
[01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:41.130]  I'm so glad that the one video I sit in on was that one.
[01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.690]  You weren't even watching.
[01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:44.770]  You were just playing Fish.
[01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.150]  I was listening and laughing.
[01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.570]  It's bad.
[01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.990]  All right.
[01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:51.130]  I need someone.
[01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:52.170]  I'm going to go insane.
[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:53.730]  Can someone look at where I am on the map?
[01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:55.070]  All right. Hang on.
[01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:55.810]  No.
[01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:57.510]  No.
[01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.270]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.330 --> 01:17:59.650]  Let me get this other snowman.
[01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:02.130]  If it's right over where I think it is and then I will help you.
[01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:05.290]  It's got to be over here.
[01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.330]  I just can't find this freaking...
[01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:10.030]  24.
[01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:13.570]  Okay.
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.010]  Gavin, you are...
[01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:15.730]  Where are you on the map?
[01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:16.610]  I'm out in the grapes.
[01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:17.590]  I'm out here in the grapes.
[01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:18.890]  Where's the freaking snowman?
[01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:19.770]  Okay.
[01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:20.490]  I see you.
[01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.030]  Out in the grapes.
[01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.970]  I forgot that phrase.
[01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:25.030]  16 for me.
[01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:26.030]  All right.
[01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:27.350]  You are out in the grapes.
[01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:33.210]  It should be south and east.
[01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:34.350]  Oh, I didn't do that one yet.
[01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:36.530]  Is that where you're at?
[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:39.750]  The southeast of where you are.
[01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:42.630]  You need to go to where...
[01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:43.690]  What is this road?
[01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:47.750]  I'm trying to think of how to explain.
[01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.250]  Yeah, keep going that way.
[01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:49.870]  Keep going that way.
[01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:50.450]  Keep going that way.
[01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:51.530]  It should be right around there.
[01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:55.810]  Off the beaten path.
[01:18:56.230 --> 01:18:57.670]  Is there no...
[01:18:57.670 --> 01:19:01.790]  If it's not there, go directly behind you on the map.
[01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:05.070]  There's a little inlet road that has a loopy eye.
[01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:06.690]  Do you see that?
[01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:07.710]  It might be over there.
[01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:08.930]  Oh my god, Eric!
[01:19:09.670 --> 01:19:09.910]  Yeah.
[01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:11.250]  Did you get it?
[01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:12.210]  I see it.
[01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:13.390]  Okay, cool.
[01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:14.330]  Thanks.
[01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.570]  Yeah, dude, no problem.
[01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:16.250]  Is it behind a loopy eye?
[01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:25.730]  Yeah, you just have to look at the shitty fucking map that Andrew gave us and then figure out what is near that that looks sort of like that.
[01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:27.850]  You mean the map that got you 24 or 25?
[01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.790]  You know what, Andrew?
[01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.510]  Yes.
[01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.210]  I'm gonna say this for you, buddy.
[01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:33.830]  Without that map, we'd be royally fucked.
[01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.390]  Oh, I just don't know how we would do this.
[01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.790]  That map has made this game, this mission possible for us.
[01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.710]  Yeah.
[01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.810]  It'd be a long day at GTA otherwise.
[01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:46.710]  God, that reminds me of Sheba Hunter.
[01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:54.190]  Trying to fill out maps, like getting a game early, like a month early so we could do the map.
[01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:59.450]  Sometimes someone would film all the videos for a map and then the map wouldn't come out.
[01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.210]  Sometimes.
[01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.230]  What game are you thinking of?
[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:07.010]  I don't remember the name of the game, but Michael made a map.
[01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.130]  Darksiders.
[01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:10.530]  Darksiders 2?
[01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:11.990]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:15.850]  He made like 200 little videos.
[01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:18.230]  And then Jack was just like, eh.
[01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:20.390]  What? Why?
[01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.330]  Because it was a lot of work to put them together. And Jack didn't want to do it.
[01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:25.730]  I mean, that sounds right.
[01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:29.550]  I didn't say it was a good reason. I said that was the reason, I assume.
[01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:32.590]  I mean, it might have been a waste of his time.
[01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:37.410]  Like monetarily, but it was just someone had already done almost all of the work.
[01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:38.210]  Yeah.
[01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:43.290]  Well, I regret to inform you that I don't know if I know which one I'm missing.
[01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.190]  Oh no.
[01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:45.510]  You bridged it.
[01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:50.550]  I think I went to, because I'm looking all over this map and I'm like, I've been there and I've been there.
[01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:55.890]  And now I'm just sort of like, I'm going around and it's like, okay, is it this one? Is it that?
[01:20:57.250 --> 01:21:01.030]  I shouldn't just go, I need to, I need to, fuck, I need to think. This sucks.
[01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:03.850]  Fuck.
[01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:08.770]  You know, it's good in a video when you're like, I need to be quiet and think.
[01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.910]  You know, it's gone well.
[01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:12.470]  All right, 17 for Geoff.
[01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:14.650]  Okay, so...
[01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.450]  Oh shit, Geoff could do the comeback of the century.
[01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:17.350]  He might.
[01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:17.810]  He could.
[01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.810]  Is it, is it this one?
[01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.570]  Is it?
[01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:26.910]  Okay, wait.
[01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.810]  What?
[01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.910]  Oh God, is that a Cooder?
[01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:29.570]  What the fuck?
[01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:30.790]  Are you a Cooder?
[01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:31.970]  Oh shit.
[01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:34.590]  Okay, so it has to...
[01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:35.330]  Okay, all right.
[01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:36.830]  Is that it?
[01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:38.030]  God damn.
[01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:40.070]  Oh my God, my brain.
[01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.990]  This sucks.
[01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:42.470]  Andrew, you're making me fucking think.
[01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:43.350]  It has to be around here.
[01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.610]  Use a map.
[01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:44.890]  Bastard man.
[01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:48.170]  How many are you on, Andrew?
[01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.870]  I'm on 23.
[01:21:50.410 --> 01:21:51.050]  Oh, goodness.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.360]  Oh, God damn it.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:57.400]  Oh shit.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:03.440]  I just, I just scared myself because there's a passenger that I killed to get this vehicle.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.540]  And I just realized his body is still in the car.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.260]  Holy shit, that scared me.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.340]  It's like, who the fuck is in the passenger seat?
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.200]  Oh, I hear it.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:13.660]  Damn it.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.520]  Is that the last one?
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.000]  No, it's 24.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.700]  He has, he has one more after that.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.380]  But like, dude, the one that I...
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.400]  If this is the one that I need, it's all the way across the map.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.400]  But also, I don't know if this is the one that I need.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.640]  I think it is.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.080]  Is the, is it on the bottom of the snowman picture on the map?
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:32.880]  Or the top?
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.820]  It's sort of where it...
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:36.500]  In the middle.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.540]  It's, yeah, it's just sort of like where it's sitting.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:47.280]  And then I try to match it the best I can with the area zoomed way in on that map.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.140]  And then look at neighborhoods.
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.760]  This guy's got a pumpkin scarecrow.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.400]  That's not a...
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.020]  Oh, there's a snowman.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.300]  Is a pumpkin scarecrow a snowman?
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.560]  No, but he has both.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.860]  Is a scarecrow a false snowman?
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:01.560]  Yeah.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.720]  Well, I mean, I don't think the purpose of the snowman is to scare birds.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.240]  Yeah, I don't think birds are scared of snowmen.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.260]  Yeah, but they could be, right?
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.040]  They could be.
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.380]  Like, there's no reason why they wouldn't be.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.180]  The snowman was dressed as a scarecrow.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.180]  Uh-huh.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.920]  I heard the jingling for a minute, then it stopped.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.300]  You got jingleteased.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.640]  Is it like the last one that you need, or what?
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.060]  No.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.260]  You guys better get off your asses and do something.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.660]  I'm catching up slowly, but...
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.320]  It's true, you are.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.520]  You do not want to get caught up on by Geoff.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:38.880]  I've seen it. Geoff wins.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.440]  That does not bode well for you in gaming circles.
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:43.400]  Oh, God.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:52.300]  I took the time to steal a faster car, and I probably shouldn't have done that, because now I have a wanted level, and this might be the thing that fucks me.
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.060]  So much of my car has fallen off.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.100]  Is that right?
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:05.160]  Maybe if enough of it falls off, it'll reveal the inner truck that you've been dreaming of.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.760]  Oh, wow, and then Meg can drive you around in it.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.820]  Meg, I'd like to go to the stall, please.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.680]  In my truck.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.660]  Get in the lorry.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:16.860]  You call it a lorry?
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.840]  Is that the word for it?
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.360]  Like a pickup truck's not a lorry.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.400]  Oh, what's a lorry?
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.860]  Like a 18-wheeler.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.700]  Isn't that a dude who says it's not Lupus over and over again?
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.540]  Yeah, Hugh Truck.
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.420]  That was a Ben King joke.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:44.480]  Do you think his name is Hugh Lorry because he comes from a long family of just drivers of huge trucks?
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.880]  How do you think we spell lorry?
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:49.980]  I don't know. I just learned what it is.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:51.520]  L-A-U-R-Y. Lorry.
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.640]  Where you at, snowman?
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:06.680]  Where you at, snowman?
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:07.820]  Oh, there you at.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.520]  Where the fuck is the snowman?
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:11.300]  Should we do a roadkill let's play?
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:12.340]  Yes.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:18.140]  I want to do like an Animal Kingdom thing where we find and kill every animal in the game.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:23.140]  Yeah, like a rare occurrences one, but we have to kill all the animals.
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.440]  Yeah. 19 for Jack.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.760]  I got my truck all stuck!
[01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:33.550]  Okay, it's gotta be up here.
[01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:40.930]  I got my mommy!
[01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:46.570]  Oh, come on. Be up here.
[01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.450]  Mom, tell him.
[01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:53.470]  How much money does everybody have?
[01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.170]  $135,000.
[01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:58.210]  In GTA?
[01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.190]  I've been depositing it.
[01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:02.890]  Yeah, no, I want to know your bank account in real life. I was...
[01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.010]  But maybe we should keep it to GTA.
[01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:06.830]  Yeah, that works.
[01:26:08.670 --> 01:26:10.630]  I have $688,000.
[01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.730]  Nice!
[01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:16.410]  Although you can't buy anything for under $5,000,000 in this game.
[01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:21.410]  I have $355,000.
[01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:22.510]  Wait, hang on.
[01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:29.360]  $3.5 million. Okay.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.720]  Where the fuck?
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.740]  I missed when it was Rooster Teeth's fucking credit card and I could just...
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.400]  We could just shark card it. It didn't matter.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:35.980]  Sorry, buddy.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.280]  We're not a shark card company.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.740]  We shark carded the company to oblivion.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:44.680]  No, we did not. No amount of shark cards.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.860]  No amount of shark cards, which by the way, always returned the profit.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:52.480]  Like everything we spent on GTA, we more than made up for in GTA.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:52.800]  Several times over.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.980]  Of course. Of course.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.860]  Trist, listen, dude. When you and I were...
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.100]  It was making money. Lots and lots of money.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.420]  It was... That wasn't what bankrupted the company.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.960]  It was other departments shark carding.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.360]  There's other people shark carding with no return.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.260]  Boy, if that's not right.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:16.860]  Someone spending 50 shark cards on an assistant.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:18.240]  Yep.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:23.200]  So... Oh, I'm looking at the wrong... Oh, my God.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:25.420]  Is this a good time to say that I got paid in shark cards?
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:27.300]  I think I know where this is. Oh, shit.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.900]  I was looking at the wrong spot. I got too excited.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.260]  Oh, fuck. I think I know where the last one is.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.200]  I think I know where it is.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.380]  You're gonna win, Eric.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.620]  Fuck. Fuck. I have to get a car.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.360]  I still can't find this 24th one.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.840]  I just died.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.020]  I'm in the middle of...
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.860]  I came up to like...
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:45.860]  I don't know what this is. Like a hospital or something?
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.400]  I was reading the map and I thought the...
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.440]  God, I was so off.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.240]  I got too excited and I got fucked up.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.220]  Shit.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:55.540]  I think I know where it is now.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:56.340]  Hey, man.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.860]  I can't find this one.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.200]  I just started looking for it.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.580]  I heard jingling where you came from for like a second.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.880]  I thought it was on that street initially.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.000]  I'm checking this street for the first time.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.980]  It's where it looked like it was on the map to me, but I'm...
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.520]  Oh, I hear the jingling again.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.160]  Okay.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.400]  I think it's over here.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:19.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.980]  Did I already get this one?
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:21.900]  Oh, no.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.820]  Oh, no.
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:24.880]  Is this not the right one?
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:25.680]  Oh, no.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.800]  Sad but funny development if that's the case.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.560]  Oh, here it is.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.040]  Oh, no.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:30.680]  Oh, shit.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.180]  Oh, God.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:32.900]  It's over here.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:33.740]  All right, I'm coming.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.140]  Thank you.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.980]  Also on the backside of everything.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:36.240]  24.
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.140]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.120]  Oh, no.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.120]  Neck and neck.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.020]  Oh, where is it?
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:42.560]  I don't see it.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.580]  It's in a yard.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:44.980]  Oh, whatever.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.380]  Oh, I see it.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:46.940]  It's across the street.
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:47.420]  No.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.160]  Has he done it?
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.040]  I got hit by a car.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.680]  It's so far away from where I need to be.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:00.020]  I need you to take 1.13 miles worth of time.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:00.540]  Throw a snowball.
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:01.560]  I threw a snowball at a cat.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.040]  Number 20.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:02.640]  Yes.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:03.680]  25.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.640]  Nice, Eric.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:06.660]  He's done it.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:09.860]  Congratulations.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:11.440]  What?
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:11.940]  That map.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:12.840]  Good job, Eric.
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.000]  It hurt.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.520]  I have like a headache from looking at that map and then looking at my screen and looking
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.280]  at my map and looking at the screen.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.000]  Oh.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.940]  Eric, the flowering of Eric, the GTA player, has been so fun to watch.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.760]  Dude, I love this game.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.420]  This is fun as shit.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.260]  I'm going to Google GTA snowman map.
[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:35.360]  The truck I stole with the movie prop, it despawned the movie prop because I took too
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:35.700]  long.
[01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:36.120]  No.
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:37.260]  Did it really?
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:39.600]  I got to find that movie prop again.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:40.860]  Holy shit.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:45.900]  I Googled snowman map and the first result is a crystal clear high res map.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:46.900]  Oh my god.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.240]  Cheater!
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.620]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:48.740]  Cheater!
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.200]  You want to send that our way, buddy?
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.520]  I mean, I don't know why you need it.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:56.960]  Eric just got 25 out of 25.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:57.880]  Yeah.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:29:58.980]  Now you can do whatever you want.
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.240]  And now I just got 25 out of 25.
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:01.900]  Did you really?
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:03.200]  Hey, congratulations, buddy.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:04.980]  Way to go.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.100]  Eric and...
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:06.520]  Eric.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.480]  Gavin and I sucking dicks in the back.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.140]  I'm Eric.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.120]  You're Eric.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:11.920]  Circle.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:13.360]  In it.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:14.740]  Okay.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:16.620]  So there's Geoff.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:18.600]  Where's Gavin?
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.640]  Gavin, where are you?
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.180]  I don't know.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.660]  Oh, there you are.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.020]  I'll come out and find you.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.200]  So what do you unlock for getting them?
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:27.960]  A hundred.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.040]  I got a hundred and...
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.140]  I got a hundred and like $30,000.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:33.120]  I need...
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.400]  So this one...
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.120]  Oh, man.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.580]  Is there something tricky to this one on the map?
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.100]  Which one are you on?
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:40.340]  Which one are you at?
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.440]  Can you see me on the map?
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.740]  Yeah, I can see you.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:44.020]  Yeah.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.060]  That one was...
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.540]  You're by the...
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.040]  It's just a cliff down to the beach.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:55.780]  Yeah, but I don't think...
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.720]  I don't think you're in the right spot.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.180]  I think you're too...
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:58.800]  Oh, okay.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:30:59.180]  I see.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:01.460]  Cliff.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.160]  Oh, I think you have to go down the little...
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:04.760]  Okay, cool.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.460]  Oh, there it is.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:06.680]  It was off the street.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.600]  God damn.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.760]  How many are you at, Gavin?
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.840]  If I shoot this explosive barrel, will it take out the snowman?
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.120]  Do it.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:13.880]  Maybe.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:14.460]  Oh, God.
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.360]  That guy's head got in the way.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:15.760]  It did.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.160]  It worked.
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.020]  Nice.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.140]  I threw the snowman away.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.000]  How many is that?
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.020]  Yeah, how many was that?
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.260]  70.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.060]  Oh, you're getting there.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:25.760]  Eight away.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.160]  I'm going to go to Gavin.
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.580]  I'm going to make my way down.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.520]  I think I'll be good.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:32.520]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.500]  This new map has confused me.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:35.800]  Oh, no.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.220]  I thought it was crystal clear.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.780]  You didn't realize that Andrew was helping you by eliminating your options.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.560]  How did you find, like, the lowest res?
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.440]  Like, that's...
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.260]  If Gavin immediately searched for it...
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:32:00.240]  I searched snowman collectible map, clicked the first article that popped up, then saved that image.
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.020]  This map is from two years ago.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:04.580]  Wait, what?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.260]  What map?
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.100]  The one you're on?
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:06.920]  Yeah.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.220]  Okay, so maybe don't use that.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.700]  Maybe this is from two years ago.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:14.480]  Maybe it's the same thing every two years... every year.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.320]  I'd be weird.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.460]  I think they'd move the snowman around or something.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.080]  Andrew's done it again.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.000]  What did I do?
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:25.120]  We're doing old content.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.240]  Well, of course.
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:28.880]  What do you mean, of course?
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.560]  We've never done it before, so it's not old content.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.220]  It's in the game.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.420]  He's out there saying it's all this new shit added.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.740]  Yeah, it's new to me.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.000]  It did get added.
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.740]  You know what, Andrew? I think I'm on your side here.
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:47.600]  Gavin's being ridiculous.
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.240]  I'll just say the way you presented it was wild.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:55.100]  Well, the way it was presented was it was new content.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.960]  Well, who presented that to you?
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.200]  GTA Online.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.480]  They said, hey, we've got a winner event going on.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:08.320]  I clicked it and then it said, here's all the stuff you can do.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:14.120]  The first result you found was a dog shit game boy map when there's one from two years ago.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.440]  That's absolutely incredible.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:21.000]  The article I sourced from was made like five days prior.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.780]  You got dog sourced.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.100]  You got dog sourced?
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:25.560]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.620]  I ranked up.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.040]  Thank you, Gavin.
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.100]  Thank you for keeping that alive.
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.060]  You and I were the only ones that ever did that or even paid attention to it.
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.680]  I think that's my job now is to keep old shit alive.
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.000]  Do not let it die.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.400]  All right. Where is Gavin? Is that Gavin? That is Gavin.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.040]  I'm pretty excited about our upcoming grapes shirt.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.260]  People have opinions about grapes.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.080]  Yeah, all grapes hate people.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.420]  Grapes hate people.
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.080]  That's a fancy house. I bet it's got a fancy snowman.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.200]  Coyote!
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:18.560]  I think I really... I did myself a disservice by becoming a rat guy when I should have become a coyote guy.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:20.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.000]  You know, the problem with that too is there's not a lot of coyote guys.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:24.840]  You can really know.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.300]  Coyote feels like it.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:28.620]  And then everyone's like, oh, little rat man, whatever.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:30.420]  And it's like, you guys don't have the fucking guts.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:32.080]  You don't have what it takes to be a little rat man.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.700]  You wish. You wish. It just, it became like a hotness.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:37.440]  And it's like, this is pathetic. You guys are pathetic.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.080]  Coyotes might be next. I might be into coyotes now.
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:46.880]  Could the grape shirt just be a purple grape field with text under it that says, where's the snowman?
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.040]  No idea what it means.
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:53.160]  No snowman on it.
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.520]  Gavin, wait! Gavin, wait!
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:57.940]  You get in?
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.960]  Yes, sir. Look, I got a festive outfit.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.420]  Oh, wow. Did that fall off the back of a truck?
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.420]  It did.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.200]  It's weird you said that. It sounded mean.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:13.760]  Now, do you think it fell off the back of a 2024 truck or a truck from two years ago?
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:17.200]  Oh, man.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.420]  Should we title this video brand new 2022 content?
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:20.940]  Yeah.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:24.400]  Oh, man.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:29.160]  Gavin, I don't know if anyone told you this. This game came out in 2012, fucker.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:30.680]  2013, idiot.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:31.400]  2013.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:33.700]  Yeah.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:35.300]  I was there.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.780]  I wasn't, apparently.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:44.100]  I was waiting. I was in 2012 saying, where the fuck is GTA 5?
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:45.860]  I was told.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.820]  Why won't it come out? And then it came out and we're like, where the fuck is multiplayer?
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.620]  Yeah, that was a weird two weeks, wasn't it?
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:52.940]  That was a weird two weeks.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.020]  Do you like how beat up my truck is?
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.800]  Oh, a wolf.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.440]  I think it looks cool.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.080]  Oh, shit. Did I hit a boar?
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.900]  Oh, my God. Was that a bear?
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:11.840]  No, a boar.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.100]  What was that?
[01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:23.730]  So is the snowman by... this is by where Michael's therapist is, right?
[01:36:24.930 --> 01:36:25.770]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:30.570]  Where you steal... where Lamar steals the... you steal the car for Lamar at the beginning of the game?
[01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:32.890]  Yeah, I don't remember there being one there.
[01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:35.690]  Oh, oh, I think it was across the street.
[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:38.790]  If I'm... that one took me a while.
[01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:40.030]  That's where I got confused.
[01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:42.070]  Like on the low side or the high side?
[01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:45.230]  On the side away from the ocean.
[01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:46.050]  Okay.
[01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:50.950]  Are you looking at the one that is like at the westernmost snowman?
[01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:51.630]  Yeah.
[01:36:51.930 --> 01:36:56.070]  Yeah, I think it's... I think it's on the side furthest away from the ocean.
[01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.770]  It's in...
[01:36:57.650 --> 01:36:58.610]  By the liquor store?
[01:36:59.110 --> 01:37:03.170]  Yeah, sort of, and it's like in the back... it's in like a backyard, I think.
[01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:04.150]  Oh.
[01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:05.890]  Yeah, I think.
[01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:09.990]  If it's the one I'm thinking of, I'm pretty sure it is.
[01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:16.910]  Gavin, I think it's in the front of this. I don't think it's back here. I don't remember.
[01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:25.610]  Oh my god.
[01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:29.910]  I guess... I guess the snowmen don't come back for me, so I can't...
[01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.270]  It's here.
[01:37:30.850 --> 01:37:31.270]  Okay, cool.
[01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:32.930]  Good.
[01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:35.830]  It just looks like you're going insane and punching at nothing.
[01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:37.930]  Oh, I did punch at nothing, briefly.
[01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:39.730]  You punched at nothing?
[01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.310]  Don't throw snowballs at me.
[01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:44.430]  Alright, 19.
[01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:46.050]  Hey, you're almost there, buddy.
[01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:47.470]  You're getting there.
[01:37:47.890 --> 01:37:48.930]  What are you at now, Geoff?
[01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:50.790]  23, I think.
[01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:52.790]  Or 22, this will be 23, maybe.
[01:37:53.730 --> 01:37:57.270]  I'm just gonna run around the city until you guys are done, hoping I get Grinch.
[01:37:58.890 --> 01:38:00.170]  Oh yeah, I wanna get Gooch.
[01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:02.290]  I mean, feel free to help me.
[01:38:03.670 --> 01:38:05.170]  Hey, you got it. You got the map.
[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:07.370]  It's crystal clear.
[01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:10.210]  Ah, there it is.
[01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:11.070]  See?
[01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:12.410]  Exactly.
[01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:20.230]  I love how much old shit we've done under the guise of new content.
[01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:24.850]  Andrew's a big fan of finding the old thing and having us do it.
[01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:27.090]  It's new to us.
[01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:29.450]  That's funny.
[01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:38.010]  Gavin is saying all this, and we're going to record the Doomsday heists tomorrow.
[01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:42.290]  That's fine. We didn't say, oh, there's a new heist out, though.
[01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:46.590]  Okay, I see your point.
[01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:47.990]  And that's fair.
[01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:52.870]  I don't wanna be in the truck. You be in the truck.
[01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:57.050]  How did you get in the back?
[01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.830]  Backseat.
[01:38:58.870 --> 01:39:01.110]  What's going on in the musical chairs, arsehole?
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:02.730]  What are we doing?
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.170]  I don't wanna be in the seat!
[01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:08.270]  Get in!
[01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:09.470]  Get out of the sodding truck.
[01:39:12.970 --> 01:39:13.370]  Alright.
[01:39:15.010 --> 01:39:15.650]  There we go.
[01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:19.270]  Dude, the rat in the backseat getting tossed around is really something.
[01:39:20.010 --> 01:39:23.230]  Oh, guys. Guess what I got for Christmas that I wanna show you guys off on the podcast.
[01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:24.390]  Okay, what?
[01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:28.050]  Bernie and Vanessa got me a hotdog warmer.
[01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:31.930]  With the rolls. It rolls the hotdog and keeps them hot.
[01:39:32.050 --> 01:39:34.110]  And keeps the buns below it.
[01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:35.570]  And it's mustard yellow.
[01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:36.090]  Like the DHD thing?
[01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:40.230]  Yeah, kinda like the DHD, but like a smaller one that sits on your counter on Oscar Myerwood.
[01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:42.250]  What happened to DHD?
[01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:43.390]  I have no idea.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:45.770]  Ah, we should've taken that.
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:46.450]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.130]  Put a lot of work into getting that fucking thing.
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:54.750]  What was it from? Like a Haunter shoot or something?
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:56.590]  It was from Haunter. We were out in California.
[01:39:56.770 --> 01:40:00.730]  It was where we went to that mine where all the people fell 1200 feet into the mine or whatever.
[01:40:02.010 --> 01:40:09.150]  And there was like a little town and in the candy store they had it for sale.
[01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:10.490]  A food truck?
[01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:11.790]  So Jack and I bought it.
[01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:14.530]  I don't think I've ever seen a food truck. Should we steal it?
[01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:17.210]  Yeah, you take the food truck.
[01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:22.390]  I'm taking the food truck.
[01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:24.690]  Might be some new content in it.
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:26.970]  Look, I just stole the food truck.
[01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:30.710]  Oh God.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.700]  Oh, this fucking mugger.
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.360]  He stabbed me so hard.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.000]  That's so funny when that happens.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:47.880]  Where'd you go? Where'd you go you little shithead?
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.280]  Did you find it?
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.880]  I like this new system.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:57.200]  I can't believe they added mugging to the game.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.120]  Oh, my truck!
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:40:59.960]  The mugger didn't make it.
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:02.300]  Well, let's get the blue one. Let's get the blue one across the street. It's bigger.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.400]  Look at that. It's not all beat the fuck up.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.540]  Hey, Eric, can you pop me on the map and see?
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.500]  Yeah, let me have a look.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:13.460]  You're...
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:16.960]  Oh, that's the last one that I had. You're like right in front of it.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.060]  Oh, I see it.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.300]  Yeah, that's the last one that I had to get.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:27.240]  I was over. If you look to like the west of where you are, there's like that little inlet.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.860]  It looks like a hospital, whatever, just to like the west of you, like that little one road with like the circle.
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:35.620]  I was in there for so long getting blasted by cops going, where is it?
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:41.200]  I got too excited and like read the map wrong because I was all fucking fried trying to figure it out.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:42.900]  And it was like, whoops.
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.000]  Is that a real cow?
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:46.540]  Where?
[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:47.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.580]  That's good cow virtual.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:49.920]  Oh, boy.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:53.680]  Geoff, things to do, cow tipping.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:53.980]  Yeah.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.320]  Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.060]  Yeah, you're winning.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.640]  You're tipping those cows, they're tipped over.
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.100]  We can call Tommy boy.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:04.960]  Can you cargo bob a cow?
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.160]  Oh!
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.160]  Oh, you can feed, you can like feed the Tyrannosaurus?
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:14.440]  Dude, can you back into a cow, get it into the back of a truck and then cargo bob the truck?
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:15.800]  Wow.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:17.380]  That feels like a thing you can do.
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:18.800]  That's the level.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:25.920]  Like we get the, you know that, that truck I have that's like Mad Max that has the scoop front that you can jump stuff off of?
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.080]  We could use that to like wedge him into something.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.400]  Oh, there's a pig fight area.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.580]  Pig fight, pig fight!
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.960]  Dude, let's bet on the pigs.
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:36.780]  We gotta bet big on the pigs, baby.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.360]  Alright, I'll take the pink one.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.580]  Oh, this guy shoved me.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:39.760]  Shove off, dude.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:41.540]  Let's go black pig.
[01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:42.620]  Go pink.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.840]  Go, go black pig, go.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.600]  Alright, we can influence the pigs with snowballs.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.320]  Okay. Oh, this is good. I like this.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.780]  This is like a Mario Party game. We're trying to snowball our pig.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.320]  Oh, I knocked over the pink pig!
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.840]  Black pig wins! Black pig wins!
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.000]  Alright, things to do, pig fight. Write that down as well.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:12.260]  Nick's gonna come back to GTA and go, what, what the pig, what pig fight?
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:13.780]  Cow tipping.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.680]  Alright, cops got me. I think I'm at the last one.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:20.340]  Where am I gonna spawn? Please just be right here.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.260]  Pretty close.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:27.280]  Is it by the gimpy eye or whatever?
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.300]  What?
[01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.020]  Like a loopy eye? Is that what Gavin said?
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.640]  Yeah, the loopy eye.
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:34.560]  That's what Eric said.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.260]  Is it at, is it at the loopy eye?
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:40.160]  What, Gavin?
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.260]  Who, me?
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:42.520]  Yeah.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:44.480]  You're the loopy eye guy.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.220]  Eric's the loopy eye guy.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.900]  Yeah, I don't know what...
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.200]  You're the one that was having trouble finding it.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:50.060]  I...
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:51.800]  I'm at the two hoops falls loopy eye.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.940]  It's like a triangle of roads in the middle.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.960]  It's where the roads triangulate.
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:43:59.160]  Oh, it's, it's the triangle. Okay, thank you.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:43:59.940]  The loop...
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.280]  I was at the, uh, wooden owl.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:04.120]  Okay, I see.
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.000]  What about a shirt?
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.980]  People like grape shirts.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:14.380]  25 to 25.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:15.940]  Nice, way to go.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:18.820]  Can I change my outfit right from here?
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:20.300]  Uh, you have to go...
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:23.020]  I think you have to go into your...
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:24.160]  Oh, it might be a saved outfit.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:31.980]  You might be able to look in, like, your saved outfits, but you had to go into the house or a, uh, shop.
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.720]  The one at this fallout thing?
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:36.320]  Fallout.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.060]  Uh, let me look on the map.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:46.480]  Wanted on record that both Geoff and Gavin reacted to my map post with a heart emoji at the time.
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:48.520]  Well, I thought...
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:51.300]  I'm not complaining about your map, Andrew. I'm not the one that was shit-talking it. That was Gavin.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:56.520]  No, here's what I thought you'd done, right? I thought you'd found some new content and you pre-prepared a good map.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.560]  New content, innit?
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.140]  Oh, what the fuck? I don't wanna drive!
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:05.780]  I don't know where you're going.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.300]  You keep getting in the driver's seat.
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:11.300]  I don't know what... yeah, I know. It doesn't let me out.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.920]  So who won? Eric won?
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.280]  Eric won, yeah.
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:14.720]  Hell yeah.
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:16.100]  Trust me, I can't believe it.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.100]  Andrew, you fucking suck.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.160]  I, yeah, I got all turned around.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:25.280]  I spent so much time trying to find the one that was closest to the casino. Could not find it.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.760]  Oh, yeah, I went for that one first. That was kind of a bollock, that one.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.760]  I think this video is a good example of what I'm gonna have to call the Andrew Panton illusion.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:39.140]  Which, up front, seems like a well-thought-out, well-researched, well-prepared, took the initiative.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:41.160]  Yes. Oh, this is good. Wow.
[01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:46.000]  I like this. Andrew, any thoughts on the Andrew Panton illusion?
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:48.640]  I'm an established magician.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.860]  I feel it's appropriate.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.240]  I've done magic before.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:55.120]  Uh-huh.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.080]  I'll continue to do magic again.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.200]  Yeah, this was magic.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:00.440]  Abracadabra.
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:01.920]  Where are we going?
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.720]  I don't even know.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:11.700]  So, real quick recap. What's everybody working on? Gavin and Eric, you're on what number?
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:14.700]  Good question. I'll let you know after I kill this.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.060]  Oh, yeah, there you go. Yeah, I remember this.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:19.940]  Let me out.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.020]  I want to browse up.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:24.460]  23.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:26.180]  Nice.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:27.800]  Nice, only two away.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:33.580]  If you browse outfits, Geoff, you can put the outfit on.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:37.660]  Like, if you go into the changing room. Sorry.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.280]  Yeah, I'm in the changing room. It just won't do anything.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:41.740]  What do you mean?
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:42.280]  It's there.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.260]  At Ponsonby's. I was walking the train.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:52.280]  Yeah, you go in the changing room, you hit right on the D-pad, and then, like, when it tells you to, and then you can go into, like, all your outfits.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:56.300]  You go to outfits, you go to festive, I think, and then it's there.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:03.080]  What month doesn't have any holidays in it?
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:04.500]  For North America.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.400]  Is there an empty month?
[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:13.180]  March? April?
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.740]  I see outfits seasonal. Is it a onesie?
[01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.280]  Yeah, that might be it. Yeah, it might be that.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:21.160]  What, is it a onesie? What is it?
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.660]  Yeah, it's the, uh, it's the snowman one.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:24.920]  Yeah, just a snowman.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.660]  Well, Eric, you're not wearing a snowman.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:32.320]  No, I wasn't going to put it on yet.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600]  March has St. Patrick's Day. Does that count?
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.140]  That's sort of something, but yeah.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:40.740]  Because I don't think we, uh...
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.640]  April has Easter.
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:44.220]  Oh, fuck. April does have Easter.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.100]  Yeah.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:46.220]  Is there anything in May?
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.920]  Yeah, it's Memorial Day and Mother's Day.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.700]  Does every month have a thing?
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:54.960]  Maybe June? Oh, June has Father's Day.
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.140]  Fourth of July?
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:58.500]  Oh, is it this? I think I might have already...
[01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.140]  Where is this one?
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.080]  August? August empty?
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.500]  August might be empty. August looks empty.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:08.640]  It looks like Labor Day is on, uh, September 1st this year.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.420]  No, August has, um, Andrew Panton's birthday.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.160]  That's true.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.080]  Yeah, but he's looking for American holidays.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:16.520]  Yeah.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.480]  Uh, looks like August.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.340]  Where's the one around here, Eric?
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:24.580]  Uh, let me see. Uh, I think you have to go further up.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:26.660]  I think it's like over here-ish.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.180]  Up the mountain? Or up here?
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.280]  No, no, no, no. Did you see, like, the little icon that I put?
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:33.560]  Can you not see the...
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.020]  Oh, cool. Good.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:42.420]  Should we release all of our seasonal videos out of season in August to cover up for the fact that there's a holiday?
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:43.540]  You suck.
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:44.680]  Christmas in August?
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.460]  Because we still haven't released either of our ghost videos.
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.160]  I think from GTA 5.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:51.100]  Oh.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.120]  Wait, what?
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.280]  So you do the Halloween?
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.500]  Where should we all meet up while we're figuring this out?
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:58.480]  Casino.
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:48:59.840]  We didn't put out our ghost videos?
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.260]  I don't think they're out now.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.180]  Wait, what?
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:05.700]  Didn't we?
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.100]  No, I don't think so.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.600]  Oh, maybe we didn't.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:10.520]  We had a bunch of other Halloween stuff.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.540]  I think we've got to do 202 volts just to get through our backlog.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.920]  Why? Monday GTA, we're back at it.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:17.600]  Let's do it.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.580]  Let's give the people what they wanted in 2018.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:26.840]  As a small company, it's not like Achievement Hunter days where we had seven editors to go through stuff.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:27.440]  That's true.
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:31.420]  The reality is we just need to play and release more GTA.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.320]  Oh, we're playing a lot. That's not the problem.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:39.200]  We need to release more GTA. We need to keep playing GTA but start releasing more GTA.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.780]  Man, can you imagine when GTA 6 comes out? Holy fuck.
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:53.700]  Do you remember, Gavin, we would sit around and make GTA 4 Let's Plays just thinking about how much fun it was going to be in GTA 5?
[01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:54.060]  Yeah.
[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:56.720]  And then GTA 5 exceeded every expectation.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.780]  The reason we started doing GTA 4 Let's Plays is that the GTA 5 trailer came out.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.920]  And then I was like, oh, I used to play GTA 4 online with one friend. We used to make up games.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:14.080]  Well, isn't that why we play GTA 4? Like, for this company, is the GTA 6 trailer came out?
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:14.640]  Yeah.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:19.280]  Every time a new trailer comes out, we play GTA 4.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.320]  Play Hangman's Noose and I get killed in the same way every fucking time.
[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:27.240]  What's crazy is now you guys have met the guy who played GTA 4.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:29.120]  Dan?
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.080]  Which one was it?
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.300]  It was Jack Shrimpton.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:32.880]  Oh, shit!
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.500]  He doesn't look like a good GTA player.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:37.360]  No.
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:42.020]  We did all the classics back in the day, 2008 or something.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:47.100]  We were seeing who could pull the parachute the latest. We were jumping onto the barge. All the classics.
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.060]  All the classics? The greatest hits?
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.260]  Pretty much everything of the first three GTA 4 Let's Plays.
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:56.600]  Landing in the propeller?
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:57.640]  Yeah.
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:01.720]  I remember that was one of the very first things we did. Pinging off the map.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:09.940]  Alright, well I'm at the front door of the casino hanging out in what appears to be a snowman suit I think I've had for a very long time.
[01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:15.860]  I don't know if I have the wrong one or if it's just...
[01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:18.660]  They need to put dates on all the content.
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:22.560]  Is your snowman like a bodysuit with a snowman helmet on?
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.100]  Okay.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:23.780]  Yeah.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:28.400]  I'm so goochable right now, it's crazy that I'm not getting gooched.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:30.240]  I'm constantly telling people that.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.080]  Where's this snowman?
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.140]  I think it's in the backyard over here.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:35.140]  Yeah.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.400]  There it is.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.300]  He's back.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.020]  He's back?
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:41.900]  Which one's that?
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:43.920]  It should be 25.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:44.340]  Ah, shit.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.380]  I wish I could throw more than three snowballs.
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:49.880]  25!
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:50.960]  Yay!
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.520]  There we go!
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:56.000]  Alright, so I need to go to my house?
[01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.180]  A house or a shop or whatever.
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.300]  Just gonna stand on the street corner waiting to get gooched.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:07.840]  Or wait for them to come up so we can make our Christmas photo, right?
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:09.340]  Yeah.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.020]  Yeah.
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:12.860]  Geoff got mugged.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:17.200]  Gavin loves this.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:19.140]  I could've been doing this the whole time.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.380]  The mugger didn't make it very far.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.540]  That's a shame.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:25.880]  He thought so.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:37.200]  Do you remember back in the day, Geoff, when if we would be in a public session and we were just AFK or just standing still, people would come up to us in-game and take selfies with us?
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.420]  That would've been funny to do a video of, like, get the most selfies taken with you.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:43.080]  That's funny.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:44.200]  That's pretty good.
[01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:45.960]  Go in passive mode and let people...
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:47.300]  Yeah.
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:51.020]  If you get gooched right in front of me, I will not be happy.
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:53.480]  You were fucking laughing pretty hard when I just got gooched.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.940]  You got gooched?
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.540]  By your mugger.
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:00.000]  Yeah, you got mugging thing.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.480]  Do you have an organization?
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:03.580]  No, I don't think so.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:06.480]  You should start one and then you can just spawn helicopters.
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:09.660]  I don't think I've ever done that.
[01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:13.440]  How do I start an organization?
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.100]  It's a whole thing.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.820]  Oh, cool. Great. Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.340]  Well, I mean, it's just in general.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:23.960]  Right. But right now we're in specific.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.180]  Everything's right now.
[01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:44.890]  You're right, Gavin. It is a lot of fun.
[01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:46.990]  It is a lot of fun.
[01:53:47.230 --> 01:53:50.110]  Oh, I'm so glad I was able to frame that so well.
[01:53:52.090 --> 01:53:53.410]  Give me the money.
[01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:55.170]  Where'd the money go?
[01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:57.670]  Give me the money.
[01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:01.810]  Which snowman is Andrew?
[01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.830]  Give me the money.
[01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:09.290]  Not me. I don't have your money.
[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:15.090]  He blasted himself.
[01:54:16.110 --> 01:54:17.390]  Oh, no, you died.
[01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:19.190]  Oh, wait, they're going to bring him back.
[01:54:20.650 --> 01:54:21.810]  Ambulance, help this man.
[01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:22.890]  Resuscitate.
[01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:25.030]  Eric, what the god damn are you doing?
[01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:28.030]  Trying to find a changing room so that way I can put this on.
[01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:29.370]  You just go to your house.
[01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:31.610]  I don't know which house is mine.
[01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:33.550]  I'm going to spin the wheel.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:38.340]  How do you spin it? Oh.
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.060]  Right bumper.
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:49.220]  Why the fuck wouldn't I be allowed to go into a building that I own?
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.760]  Can't go in the garage either.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.080]  Okay, Gavin.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:00.120]  Oh, 20 fat ones.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:02.420]  Oh, 20 fat ones? Okay, here, follow me.
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:06.020]  You going to kill me in the racetrack?
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:06.140]  No, no, no.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:11.840]  You had 10,000 mugged from you. I stole it, so now I have 10,000 chips.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.360]  Bet on the ponies.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.460]  Oh, shit, you can play ponies?
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:16.580]  Yeah.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:18.740]  Sit down.
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:20.680]  Right on the D-pad, place a bet.
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.780]  Is this new content?
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:22.720]  No.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:24.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.000]  Yeah, it's a brand new style, dude.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:26.700]  Who we feeling?
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.820]  Geoff, did you quit?
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:30.300]  Yeah, I left to come back in.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.520]  Main event or single event?
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:32.280]  Invite me main event.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:33.500]  In a second.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.840]  I'm sending you an invite right now.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:36.500]  Oh, that's Gavin.
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.640]  I'm sending you an invite right now.
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:43.780]  I think Reach Around Town is set to win.
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.820]  Should we do Creepy Dentist for Geoff?
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.900]  Oh, could you bet on multiple?
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.120]  No, I think you can only bet on one.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:52.200]  How much can you bet?
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:54.300]  I'm going to put all of it down.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.140]  I'm going to put 10,000.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:58.700]  All right, I'm going to put...
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:02.400]  I'm going to put 10,000 on Reach Around.
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.560]  I kind of like Reach Around, I was looking at that too.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:08.620]  Bet is placed.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:12.840]  Okay, I'm doing it on...
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:15.300]  I'm putting it on Creepy Dentist for Geoff.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.300]  Seven to one.
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.220]  Hey, I can fucking go in the building finally.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:20.500]  Yay.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.160]  Oh, you're in the casino?
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:22.260]  Come bet with us.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.180]  You got 60 seconds to come bet on a horse.
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:25.900]  Casino.
[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:27.920]  Geoff, go to inside track.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.180]  You guys can sit next to us.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:32.180]  Come and sit in the snowman zone.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:33.960]  Snow zone?
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.540]  It's like the end of Ocean's Eleven.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:37.120]  Oh, shit.
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:39.340]  All right, come sit down.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.860]  Throw a bet down on one of the horses.
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:45.500]  I have to go speak to guest services to get a standard membership.
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:50.120]  All the inconveniences of real life.
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:53.320]  Wow, guys, do you love video games?
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:54.500]  Fuck you.
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:55.100]  Main event.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.380]  You got 15 seconds.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.380]  Slop 10k on something.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.360]  Old ill will.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.960]  29 to one?
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:03.660]  29 to one.
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.480]  Place in the bet.
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:06.240]  How much? 10k?
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.660]  Whatever the odd was.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.040]  I was just going fast as I could.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:10.340]  All right.
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:11.860]  I think 100.
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:12.400]  Come on, five.
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.700]  Come on, Creepy Dentist.
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:16.460]  Which number was mine?
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:16.740]  Shit.
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:18.420]  Oh, yeah, which number was mine?
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:20.200]  Horse number six.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.600]  Come on, number six.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.620]  Is Creepy Dentist winning?
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:24.140]  Oh, five.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:25.240]  Reach around.
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:26.420]  You're six to one.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.060]  Yeah, you're three.
[01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:27.900]  Come on, six.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:28.600]  Come on, six.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:29.620]  There you go, buddy.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.280]  Come on, old ill will.
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.320]  No, don't let him catch up.
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:33.940]  Save.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:34.860]  Faster, faster, faster.
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:35.460]  Motherfucker.
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:36.580]  No, no.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.160]  All right, kick it into high gear, baby.
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:41.700]  Let's go.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:42.060]  That's right.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:42.780]  Turn on the start up.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.500]  Oh, shit.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:44.420]  Here we go.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.540]  Here we go.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.600]  Choco, choco, choco, choco.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:48.320]  Reach around.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.040]  Number three.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:49.520]  No, six.
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:50.480]  Come back, come back, come back.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.320]  Oh, six is falling.
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.400]  Five, come on.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:53.980]  Come on, Creepy Dentist.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.060]  He rushed too soon.
[01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:56.780]  Push Creepy.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:57.340]  Here we go, here we go.
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:58.100]  Push Creepy.
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:57:59.040]  Third wind.
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.020]  Here it comes.
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:01.000]  Here it comes.
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:01.560]  Get beads.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:02.060]  No.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:02.960]  Get beads.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.940]  Beads in town.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:04.900]  Reach around.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:06.800]  No, Creepy Dentist.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:08.280]  Come on.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:15.760]  I got second, I think.
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.980]  And much like real life, we all lost our money.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:19.600]  Okay, good.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.420]  Oh, I got blood hole in me.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.480]  Third place.
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.880]  Negative 100.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.580]  Alright, should we take the selfie?
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:33.960]  Yeah, let's take the selfie.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.080]  Oh, you know what?
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.860]  It may be nice to do it against the wall with the snowflakes.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:38.960]  Oh, let's do that.
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:39.960]  That's kind of pretty.
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:41.220]  Christmas-y.
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:41.480]  Okay.
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:42.040]  Right?
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:43.320]  Yep.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:44.980]  Where are you, Geoff?
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.160]  I was maybe at a different wall.
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:55.340]  Alright, Geoff, come on my right.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:57.160]  There you go.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.200]  How's that look?
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:58:59.340]  Okay.
[01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:04.200]  How we doing?
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:07.660]  Alright, everyone look at the camera.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:08.840]  Okay.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.900]  Wait, Geoff's pissed off.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:14.760]  Geoff!
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.620]  Oh my god, Geoff.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:17.640]  It's so hard.
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:20.380]  Alright, hold on.
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.280]  I gotta redo it.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.260]  Snowflake on three.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:27.440]  Snowflake.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:29.660]  That was great.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:30.860]  Alright, everyone do that gesture.
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:31.700]  Okay.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:32.200]  How do I gesture?
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:33.960]  I click in both sticks.
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.180]  Yep.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.780]  How do we do?
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.740]  Alright, let me send it to the group.
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:44.620]  Okay.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.000]  Dance for me, Eric.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:47.200]  Dance for me.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.520]  Dance for me.
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:50.960]  I'm trying.
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:51.620]  It won't let me.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:52.960]  Dance for me, boy!
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:53.480]  There we go.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:54.260]  There we go.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.720]  Now we're good.
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.320]  Dance for me.
[01:59:57.820 --> 01:59:58.700]  Give me the money.
[01:59:58.980 --> 01:59:59.560]  I'm grabbing it.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:00.240]  I gotta have it.
[02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.320]  I'm addicted to cash.
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:05.880]  Nice.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:07.580]  Yeah!
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:10.720]  That's really great.
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.160]  That is really, really good.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.480]  You gotta figure out how to get that off of here so we can make it the thumbnail.
[02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:20.360]  Because that's awesome.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:23.660]  Save it and upload it to GT online or whatever.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:24.800]  Yeah.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:25.740]  God damn.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.640]  That's awesome.
