[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay.
[00:04.860 --> 00:12.700]  Today, Eric, Andrew, Nick, and I are gonna play a little Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Prop Hunt.
[00:14.580 --> 00:19.160]  Classed Achievement Hunter Prop Hunt game. We used to play it in Gary's mod, but as everybody knows
[00:19.160 --> 00:23.920]  it's in Call of Duty as well. A more simplified, streamlined version. No bananas, but lots of road
[00:23.920 --> 00:29.980]  cones. So, uh, let's get to it boys. I have a question. Yeah. Have you all played
[00:29.980 --> 00:37.440]  Prop Hunt before? No. Uh, yeah, in Gmod. And, and, Andrew? I have, yes. Okay. So you just have to, like,
[00:37.520 --> 00:44.400]  pretend to, like, blend in or whatever? Yep. Yeah, you'll see here. Okay. Uh, it'll be us, uh, and then
[00:44.400 --> 00:52.640]  the lucky rich Mexican in Bree store, it looked like. Get to be on our team. Good. Oh, Iraq 1991, the
[00:52.640 --> 00:59.700]  classic prop place. Yeah, a lot of props in the early 90s Iraq. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, like, just don't
[00:59.700 --> 01:05.680]  get shot. Is that the whole point? Yep, just stay alive. So we're props right now. So, yeah, in three seconds we gotta go high.
[01:06.600 --> 01:12.160]  So just try to blend in where you think a crate would be. Okay. Oh wow, I'm a crate from the hit
[01:12.160 --> 01:19.640]  film Snake Eyes. So now if you want, Eric, since you've not played this game, you can see once you
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.220]  get in, if you want to, like, match onto something, you can hold left trigger and hit X and you'll,
[01:24.260 --> 01:28.640]  like, affect the slope. It'll also lock you into position if you want to lock yourself
[01:28.640 --> 01:31.620]  into position. Without doing that, just hit right trigger. You can see the instructions there.
[01:31.860 --> 01:36.740]  If you got it, your view is limited because you're stuck as a box. You can hit clicking
[01:36.740 --> 01:41.100]  on the right stick to see. Oh balls, I fucked up. And then if they come at you and they start
[01:41.100 --> 01:46.720]  shooting you, you can hit left bumper to hit them with a stun and then run. You can hit right bumper
[01:46.720 --> 01:52.620]  three times to drop decoys of what you are and you can hit Y to change twice to change props.
[01:53.600 --> 01:57.580]  Okay, those are good for if you're, like, on the run and you're fucking scared. And there comes this
[01:57.580 --> 02:06.480]  asshole. He's running past me. He can run all he wants because I'm just a fucking ammo crate.
[02:06.740 --> 02:13.120]  I'm nothing. Oh shit. I am but a table, sir. How's everybody doing? Where's everybody at?
[02:13.380 --> 02:21.580]  I'm surrounded by people. I'm inside and a guy just, uh, ran by me. You shot me. Oh, they're
[02:21.580 --> 02:27.680]  shooting everything. Now, also, keep in mind every 30 seconds or so, uh, for them, your character
[02:27.680 --> 02:33.440]  auto-misses so they can kind of geo-locate where you are or audio-locate where you are. Got it.
[02:33.520 --> 02:42.220]  I'm getting chased. Oh, well. That's dead end. I concussed four of them. They shot me one time,
[02:42.260 --> 02:46.200]  but I'm still good. I'm dead. If you have nerves of steel, you can survive a shot. What'd you say,
[02:46.200 --> 02:52.040]  Nick? Uh, what is the, what is the stun option? Left bumper. You, it's like throws,
[02:52.120 --> 02:55.860]  it hits him with like a, a stun grenade or a concussion grenade. It's just real quick.
[02:57.240 --> 03:01.280]  No, you just hit it when they're in front of you. As long as, as long as I can see you,
[03:01.360 --> 03:08.080]  it'll hit him. And then you just haul ass. Oh my God. And he shook it off and didn't realize it
[03:08.080 --> 03:15.100]  was me that stunned him. So sometimes you can get lucky. Oh, Eric. He keeps shooting. He's not
[03:15.100 --> 03:25.860]  shooting me though. Oh my God. Still alive, baby. This is a table, Nick. This is yeah. I'm a table,
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.680]  baby. Unfortunately, Breaster and the rich Mexican are both dead with Johnny caviar.
[03:31.820 --> 03:37.900]  Yeah. It's just me, Nick and Eric holding down the fort. If we live another two minutes,
[03:37.900 --> 03:45.540]  we went two minutes. Yeah. That's scary. Lifetime. Oh my God. And they're going to,
[03:45.620 --> 03:51.640]  we're going to, we're going to whistle in 10 seconds. Oh no. Fucking terrified of whistling.
[03:52.140 --> 03:57.320]  Yup. So I got in a perfect position earlier as a barrel and then was like, what's changed you?
[03:58.140 --> 04:03.720]  So then I had to find a new spot as a table. Oh my God. It whistles out, but they're not,
[04:03.720 --> 04:09.180]  they're not coming for me. There is nothing cooler than when they catch you and you flash
[04:09.180 --> 04:14.060]  them and then switch props and then manage to evade and hide as something else. Oh,
[04:15.020 --> 04:18.860]  that guy's just watching. He just, he just shot a bunch of shit around me. It's so funny because
[04:18.860 --> 04:23.620]  Eric, you look so out of place. You look absolutely right. You don't blend in at all
[04:23.620 --> 04:30.380]  with your environment, but I'm so small. I'm just a little guy. Oh, oh, you're whistling. You're
[04:30.380 --> 04:42.540]  gonna whistle in one second, Eric. This is incredible. This is incredible. Biggest butthole
[04:42.540 --> 04:51.120]  clinchers in video. How you feeling, Andrew? How's this feeling? Oh my God. It's real stressful.
[04:52.020 --> 04:57.940]  Oh, they got Nick. Oh God. So is it just me? Just me and you, Nick, or Eric, just me and you.
[04:57.940 --> 05:04.020]  Oh my God. How can they tell that they hurt you? Run, Geoff!
[05:13.220 --> 05:16.200]  Okay, no more whistles, but they're all over Geoff.
[05:19.240 --> 05:22.080]  Live, live, Geoff. Live.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.700]  Oh my God. I'm gonna make it. They're not even close to me.
[05:27.940 --> 05:33.580]  They're definitely not over here. Now, if you want to be ballsy, do one of these.
[05:38.400 --> 05:45.560]  Round win. Wow, way to go, fellas. For your first ever game of prop hunt.
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.680]  When you said butthole clincher, you're right. Now it gets hard.
[05:50.680 --> 05:53.740]  Steamy, steamy slim meat.
[05:57.440 --> 05:59.280]  Oh, we killed a guy next to me.
[06:02.500 --> 06:08.360]  Okay, now we gotta hunt, right? So is there a... is there a reason, like, why you don't... that's
[06:08.360 --> 06:14.520]  funny. Like, a reason not to shoot everything? Uh, well, in the PC version, when you run out
[06:14.520 --> 06:19.680]  of ammo, you die. In this version, no, you can respawn. So there's no reason not to shoot
[06:19.680 --> 06:24.860]  everything that I can understand. So we're just hanging out here at the beginning. We can't see
[06:24.860 --> 06:29.980]  them. Yeah, they have 20 seconds to hide. They're invisible to us. What if they slide past us? I
[06:29.980 --> 06:35.440]  don't think we'll see them. Okay. We can also shoot each other as much as we want. Eric, you look very...
[06:39.420 --> 06:46.800]  The city is yours. All right, here we go. Let's hunt some props. It's really hard to find them
[06:46.800 --> 06:50.880]  the first couple times you play it. Okay. Until you kind of learn the map, and then you start to
[06:50.880 --> 06:56.620]  notice when stuff's out of place. Does it indicate, like, when you hit someone? Yeah. Yeah, you'll know.
[06:56.720 --> 07:06.640]  Ow. Who died? I died. How did you die? I blew myself up. Okay. You should respawn, though, right? I did.
[07:07.760 --> 07:13.760]  I died again. What? Well, that barrel has a wider range than I expected, if I'm being honest.
[07:13.760 --> 07:19.100]  I just killed three decoys. Where the fuck is the guy? Do you really? Yeah. Is it this thing?
[07:19.900 --> 07:21.460]  No, I know it's not you, because I was...
[07:23.100 --> 07:24.900]  Well, somebody's out of decoys. That's good.
[07:29.280 --> 07:31.100]  Somebody flashed me. Again.
[07:34.300 --> 07:42.240]  Fuck. Where is he? Where'd he go? Oh, I got him. Nice. Oh, he's running.
[07:44.220 --> 07:48.800]  Did you get him? What was it? I don't know. Something was running around.
[07:50.620 --> 07:55.140]  It might not have been, uh, it might not have been one of you guys in here with me. It might have been
[07:55.140 --> 08:05.610]  the breester or the rich Mexican. I see one. And then, uh, you just gotta start to... the whistling
[08:05.610 --> 08:17.490]  will drive you fucking crazy. You'll be like, I'm right on top of it. Damn. Oh, you can shoot
[08:17.490 --> 08:27.050]  the tires on these trucks. Oh, I'm not seeing anybody. There are three left. Also, you have
[08:27.050 --> 08:33.790]  one concussion grenade. Got one. Oh, he's running. Where the fuck did he go? He flashed me.
[08:36.270 --> 08:43.390]  He was a barrel. He's a barrel? Yeah, but he probably swapped. Oh, no, he's still a barrel.
[08:43.390 --> 08:50.850]  Oh, he's inside. I'm chasing him. He flashed me again. Fuck, where is he? He's around here.
[08:53.230 --> 08:56.250]  Did you ping it? Somewhere over here.
[08:58.350 --> 09:04.250]  All right. Keep your eyes open for shit that's not... I heard it. It's over here. I got him.
[09:05.110 --> 09:09.630]  Yeah? Well, I got somebody. I don't know if it's him. And another one. All right, that's two. Nice.
[09:09.630 --> 09:12.630]  Nice. How many more do we need? One last one.
[09:16.530 --> 09:18.970]  Yeah, ears open for the whistle. Yep.
[09:21.330 --> 09:26.810]  How do you ping? 15 seconds. Up on the d-pad. Yeah, okay. If you hear the whistle, ping.
[09:29.830 --> 09:31.610]  Yeah, I'm gonna hold fire for the whistle.
[09:36.730 --> 09:40.410]  Oh, I heard it. Like somewhere over here. Maybe it's down here in the basement.
[09:45.080 --> 09:55.100]  Nope. Nope. Nope. Shit.
[09:58.160 --> 10:05.600]  Where is he? Last whistle.
[10:08.160 --> 10:17.180]  Oh! God, I hear him. He's close. Is he not close? Where is he? Somewhere in here. Yeah, right?
[10:17.180 --> 10:20.280]  Is it this folding chair? All right, I'm popping him.
[10:21.720 --> 10:28.740]  Is that it? No, it's just a folding chair. Damn it. It fell when I shot it. I don't know, man.
[10:34.280 --> 10:37.840]  Where are you, you little bitch? They're gonna win. Yeah. Damn it.
[10:39.900 --> 10:43.370]  Oh. Fuck. Where was he? I don't know. I thought I...
[10:44.340 --> 10:48.520]  Damn it. Damn it. I don't know. It's impossible. I could not tell where that whistle was.
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.780]  One of the frustrating things about the game, but it also probably makes sense, is they won't...
[10:53.660 --> 10:57.140]  They don't show you, right? You don't get to find out where he was.
[10:57.860 --> 11:01.300]  That was the guy that kept flashing me. Yeah. And then I was like, oh, wait.
[11:04.100 --> 11:07.140]  How did you know that was a guy, like, when you shot him the first time? Did you just,
[11:07.160 --> 11:11.540]  like, put a couple bullets in him? Like, that was it? Who, me? Yeah. I knew they
[11:11.540 --> 11:14.540]  were out of place. I'd already cleared that area. That stuff wasn't there before.
[11:16.180 --> 11:25.230]  There's no way to do this. No, they're gonna know.
[11:29.190 --> 11:30.870]  Let's see. How do I...
[11:35.180 --> 11:42.360]  And locked into place. Oh, I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked. I'm so fucked. Uh-oh.
[11:44.780 --> 11:47.520]  Uh, I'm not surviving this one, gang. No.
[11:49.600 --> 11:52.900]  Shit myself. It's okay. I had... I moved around for, like, the first
[11:53.300 --> 11:56.480]  30 seconds the last round, looking for a spot after they were in the game.
[12:00.380 --> 12:05.520]  Everybody keeps blowing themselves up. Uh-oh. Who's this box next to me?
[12:07.520 --> 12:18.240]  I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I fucked up. I
[12:18.240 --> 12:23.780]  don't know how I survived that. I shouldn't be bigger and more out of place. I was gonna try to
[12:23.780 --> 12:27.920]  suggest that you hop on me, Geoff, at the table. Damn it. A fight.
[12:29.600 --> 12:33.160]  Can we do that? Can we stack as props on each other? Oh, Geoff.
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.380]  Dead hole.
[12:39.380 --> 12:53.760]  Oh, shit. Can you change? Yeah. I'm gone. Oh, that sucks. That was a tough round for me.
[12:57.730 --> 13:01.190]  Hey, all right. So, outside seems to be much worse to get shot.
[13:02.710 --> 13:09.410]  Eric is on the move. Yeah. I'm gonna switch over to Eric. Oh, Eric, that's great. If you could get
[13:09.410 --> 13:13.370]  on top of that table or under it. I was thinking about it, but I don't think it's happening.
[13:14.310 --> 13:17.870]  I'm still alive. I just don't know if they're coming. Are you? Yeah, just so you guys know,
[13:17.870 --> 13:21.250]  you have all the same mechanics as if you were playing as a person. You can climb ladders and
[13:21.250 --> 13:31.590]  shit too. Yeah. Oh. Watching Andrew is a giant box. Drop through a hole in the ground.
[13:33.390 --> 13:38.270]  That guy looked right by you. Yep. He did. I was a different thing earlier.
[13:38.270 --> 13:44.070]  Said a decoy ran away after last whistle. Oh yeah. Do decoys stay the same after you've
[13:44.070 --> 13:50.190]  planted them? Yeah. If you change? Yeah. Okay. That's why I didn't get on top.
[13:50.450 --> 13:57.110]  That's why I didn't get on top. Wow. Get out of the area. I'm good. I'm good.
[13:57.370 --> 14:02.430]  What about the whistle though? I'm okay. I'm okay. He's gonna come right back.
[14:02.430 --> 14:10.410]  Uh, my butthole. He thinks he cleared it. A lot of shooting out there.
[14:12.790 --> 14:17.090]  That lock in place button. Oh my god. That lock in place button helps so much. Yeah.
[14:21.990 --> 14:23.330]  Minute and a half.
[14:27.450 --> 14:32.670]  You're all of our hopes and dreams there. Yeah. Oh man. It's hard. All our hopes and dreams
[14:32.670 --> 14:35.870]  rest with you. You and the rich Mexican number two.
[14:38.030 --> 14:40.990]  So most of us. One minute. One minute. One minute.
[14:43.790 --> 14:52.690]  What? I'm the last one? Oh my god. Do this Eric. Just you Eric. 50 seconds. 53, 52, 51. Oh it's
[14:52.690 --> 14:59.010]  the longest 48 seconds in the history of mankind. Just one whistle. You just got to make it one
[14:59.010 --> 15:08.750]  whistle. Yep. Oh. Oh. Oh come on. Just whistle a little but not in. Come on. Yep. Okay. Easy.
[15:09.270 --> 15:17.250]  Ready? All right buddy. It's your last 26 seconds. Okay. Don't forget if you need to,
[15:17.310 --> 15:24.750]  left bumpers flashbang. You don't need to do it yet though. Go. Damn it. He got me. That was so
[15:24.750 --> 15:30.630]  good. Damn it. Oh that was so good. Oh that was so good. Fuck. Okay. Let's swing this back.
[15:31.290 --> 15:34.370]  Swing it back. Best play was the breester.
[15:40.120 --> 15:43.240]  That was. That was the best play. Great play buddy.
[15:45.900 --> 15:49.120]  Damn it. What a heartbreaker.
[15:50.660 --> 15:56.800]  Cranking my volume. I'm getting ready for these whistles. Whistles go woo.
[16:02.420 --> 16:10.300]  Shoot every table I see. Man it's such a fun game type. Just so silly. It's intense. What I like
[16:10.300 --> 16:17.580]  about it is that we're on the same map and you get to know what belongs where. Yeah. What the?
[16:17.580 --> 16:21.920]  Yeah this is the first time I've played it on this map. They're decoys. You can tell
[16:21.920 --> 16:28.040]  immediately. Got one. Oh that's a decoy. Nice. These are all decoys. Damn. I should rely on the
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.080]  decoy. Whoops. Yeah. Andrew. Got one. I shot an explosive barrel and I thought I was far
[16:34.080 --> 16:43.120]  enough away and I was not. Yeah they'll get you. They bite. Oh I got someone. Did you? Yeah. Oh I
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.640]  got flashed. Damn it. I saw him too. Fuck. Got me. Damn it.
[16:51.020 --> 16:55.560]  Someone's over here. I got flashed by something that was just over here. No it's gone.
[17:01.280 --> 17:02.420]  Nah everything's fine here.
[17:04.880 --> 17:15.320]  No. Uh. God damn. Not there.
[17:20.240 --> 17:21.520]  Can I whistle him too?
[17:24.700 --> 17:27.440]  I got one in here in this room with... I got him. He's dead. He flashed me there.
[17:29.920 --> 17:34.240]  Somebody else flashed me too. Who was that? Which one of you little shits flashed me?
[17:35.320 --> 17:36.160]  Somebody else is in here.
[17:39.560 --> 17:41.300]  What could it be now?
[17:43.500 --> 17:49.940]  What can it be flashing in my face? It's that guy. I've destroyed him. God damn it.
[17:49.980 --> 17:55.620]  There's someone around here. Where are they? I just got a ammo crate decoy. So keep an eye out.
[18:00.120 --> 18:05.460]  On me. Where's Nick? I just pinged it. I pinged it. He was on this rooftop.
[18:07.620 --> 18:10.980]  What was he? He's a box. A crate.
[18:12.800 --> 18:15.720]  Where'd he go? Oh wait. I think he dropped down the hall.
[18:16.160 --> 18:23.400]  Did you? He was right here. He was right there. He flashed me twice. He's out of flashes. Whoever he is.
[18:29.890 --> 18:32.130]  I'm insane. This is making me insane.
[18:37.520 --> 18:40.600]  Little son of a bitch go. Where the hell did that little prick go?
[18:43.520 --> 18:47.560]  He must have gone down. Oh here he is. Got him. Nice. Nice.
[18:49.080 --> 18:50.980]  So there's only two more.
[19:00.090 --> 19:03.630]  Whistle. Oh that sounded really good. It sounds so close to where I'm at. Yep.
[19:07.680 --> 19:11.520]  It's kind of good when people are searching to have somebody stand kind of medium back
[19:11.520 --> 19:24.950]  just to see if anybody moves around. Dude, I don't know. Can they be cinder blocks? Yeah.
[19:25.970 --> 19:35.170]  Fuck. They can be a wide. They can be vehicles. They can be a wide variety of things.
[19:35.610 --> 19:37.450]  Got him. Got him. Got one. Nice.
[19:40.390 --> 19:44.970]  All right. We're not gonna get this last whistle. No.
[19:52.080 --> 19:55.840]  Damn it. I want to know where they were. Somebody's got a great fucking hiding place.
[19:55.840 --> 19:58.140]  Yep. Damn.
[20:02.100 --> 20:04.340]  Damn. Damn it.
[20:06.120 --> 20:18.500]  They got us. Oh Nick, look at you. Weee. I was like...
[20:21.430 --> 20:32.110]  Well, no wonder we were fighting demons. Yeah. You can't fight demons. That's scary, dude.
[20:32.110 --> 20:40.530]  Do you guys wanna do one more? This is a very popular map and uh... Everyone knows it? Yeah.
[20:45.810 --> 20:49.250]  That's gonna be a really evident spot.
[21:04.120 --> 21:06.420]  I died immediately.
[21:06.420 --> 21:17.860]  All right. I'm locked. Yeah. Everybody's seen me. I'm dead. Everybody's seen me.
[21:19.280 --> 21:24.900]  Some fucking giant trash can running around. Oh Christ. Yeah, you're fucked.
[21:26.800 --> 21:31.940]  This is a tough one. This is gonna go fast. This is gonna go fast. It's a small map and everybody
[21:31.940 --> 21:39.620]  knows every square inch of it. Oh boy. Go to hell. Go to hell. Fuck off. Eat shit and die. Go Nick.
[21:40.320 --> 21:42.940]  Run. Run. I thought I could go through there.
[21:47.660 --> 21:52.200]  You can't be back there. You're gonna run. That's out of the game. I didn't know you could go there.
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.860]  Nick's like, you can't kill me. I'll kill myself.
[21:59.780 --> 22:06.000]  I don't even see. What is this? I don't. Where are they? You don't get to. Yeah, I wish you could look around the camera.
[22:06.360 --> 22:09.560]  Whatever you are. He's about to die. Oh no. A whistle.
[22:11.980 --> 22:18.880]  Brutal. Wow. That uh. We might do three rounds. Yeah. But not the way we want. Yeah. No. What? Yeah. Yeah.
[22:19.640 --> 22:22.800]  Best. Yeah. Let's see my fucking skills though.
[22:24.640 --> 22:33.980]  Okay. Well. Cust. Cust. Bup. Bup. Bup. Bup. What? I can cust way more than that. I made it like 300 feet.
[22:34.160 --> 22:42.480]  Well, I didn't die there. I died way later. They didn't show the whole thing. Oh boy. Okay. Way later. As I turn the corner.
[22:48.270 --> 22:53.730]  Eric, I'm shooting you in the butt. It looks like you're pooping blood. That's awesome. How do I spray paint? Make me poop blood.
[22:53.730 --> 23:07.490]  Uh. Hold left on the d-pad. And then right bumper. And then you can be like. Got it. GG. Or. Eagle claw. Or.
[23:09.790 --> 23:13.830]  All right. Let's go. Oh. Oh shit. I was busy spray painting. Yep.
[23:16.430 --> 23:21.610]  Got one. Oh. It's a decoy. Damn. Well. At least you know what it is. No. Not. Nothing in here.
[23:25.650 --> 23:39.770]  Ah. I'm blind. Blind. Shit. Got one. Nice. That's a helmet. Oh. I see one running. Oh. It flashed me. Oh. It's a sign. Got it. It's over here. It's behind you.
[23:40.610 --> 23:52.680]  I saw the sign. It's a 2x4. I copyrighted that. Did they get him? Got him. Got him. Did he escape? Okay. Another one. I saw him running around too.
[23:52.680 --> 24:00.980]  Running around. There's a barrel. There's a barrel running. I just crossed. I just saw it. I got him. I got. Oh. There he is. There he goes.
[24:02.240 --> 24:15.560]  God damn. Got him. Let's see. Uh. There's somebody hiding in here.
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.740]  There's. What do we got? It sounded close over here.
[24:25.300 --> 24:31.260]  Two left. We ping it if you're close. Sort of in this area. It just helps.
[24:35.170 --> 24:39.070]  How? Oh. Uh. Maybe the trap doors. Yeah. Right there.
[24:48.280 --> 24:53.400]  Shit. Oh. Okay. It's coming over from this way maybe?
[25:02.250 --> 25:04.070]  Where the fuck are they?
[25:08.110 --> 25:10.690]  What's out of place? What's out of place?
[25:14.810 --> 25:20.090]  Nice. Good. Last enemy alive. Bean Flicker. Bean Flicker. Hold on. Listen.
[25:22.330 --> 25:27.170]  Oh. I see him. What is he? He's right here. I killed him. He got him. Hell yeah. Nice.
[25:28.590 --> 25:35.870]  Alright. Nice. Look at us being little badasses. Where'd he go? Gang. Hell yeah.
[25:36.910 --> 25:40.690]  Best play cap. Yeah. Nice. Johnny C.
[25:45.630 --> 25:47.350]  Oh. There it is. Gotta get him.
[25:50.530 --> 25:54.710]  I had no idea you could get up there. It's pretty cool.
[25:58.090 --> 26:03.670]  We all just learned a lot, didn't we? Yep. I played this map 50 times. I didn't know you could get up there.
[26:06.590 --> 26:13.030]  What am I? Oh. I want to change that. Oh. This is also dog shit. Oh. These are all shit.
[26:15.470 --> 26:21.650]  I'm boned. I'm gonna fuck it up. B-O-N-E-D-O.
[26:22.910 --> 26:26.190]  Okay. I'm in a spot. I feel good. I think I'm alright.
[26:27.610 --> 26:32.490]  How the fuck did he get across there? Oh yeah. I'm already up here too, Andrew.
[26:32.950 --> 26:40.630]  Shit. You have to run. You have to run. Oh shit. Yeah. Well, it's been an honor serving you gentlemen.
[26:45.330 --> 26:53.230]  I'm dead. That was fast. I died. The bean flicker got me right away. Wow. What a name.
[26:56.610 --> 27:00.170]  Oh, Geoff. This is nice. What are you? I'm a little pot. Oh, nice. You're a little pot.
[27:01.150 --> 27:04.090]  I'm all lit up here, but I'm not. I think I'm pretty dark.
[27:04.830 --> 27:07.230]  I'm like the little chamber pot or whatever Andrew is. Yeah.
[27:16.470 --> 27:21.030]  What happened, Andrew? I whistled and he immediately saw me.
[27:24.090 --> 27:28.210]  Uh, you're good. You're good, Geoff. Kind of torn between hanging out here and...
[27:28.210 --> 27:31.530]  I think you're good. If you're going to do anything, wait after the next whistle.
[27:32.450 --> 27:36.570]  Yeah. Hang for now. This isn't the spot I wanted. This is my backup spot. I couldn't get to my
[27:36.570 --> 27:40.690]  primary spot, but I can probably get to it now. Well, but like no one's around you. You're in a
[27:40.690 --> 27:46.590]  good spot. Let's see if anyone comes. You're right. You're right. Where's the other guy? Oh, he's hidden really well.
[27:47.630 --> 27:54.890]  Is he? Yeah. He's, I would almost argue, technically out of the play area. Nice.
[27:55.050 --> 27:57.750]  Oh, really? But pay attention to where that is. That's probably where they're hiding.
[27:59.310 --> 28:03.450]  Oh, that's a crazy spot. Like he hopped the fence, but he's not fully over.
[28:03.930 --> 28:09.390]  Yep. Don't move. Don't move. Don't... Oh, get out! Run! Run, little pot! Go, go, go, go, go! Run, pot, run!
[28:10.210 --> 28:15.190]  Oh, I couldn't... Oh, you got caught! I couldn't get in there. Oh, that sucked. Yeah, there's a little lip or something. That sucks.
[28:16.950 --> 28:21.830]  Dude, his, this spot's crazy. Let me see where he is. What is he? So this is Hannah we're watching?
[28:22.270 --> 28:30.150]  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. How do you, you can't move the camera, huh? Oh. Oh. Oh! Go, Hannah!
[28:31.330 --> 28:37.570]  Oh, that's gonna be it. Oh. Oh, Hannah. Run, Hannah! Hannah's got... Two out in the open.
[28:40.450 --> 28:46.150]  The, the small maps like this are really fun. Yeah, it's way, it's way more intense. Yep.
[28:46.590 --> 28:49.910]  This is not a good play. I was like, well...
[28:52.030 --> 28:54.130]  Uh... Ow! Yeah. Good guess!
[28:57.030 --> 29:03.330]  Ooh, max point relash. Bag him. Die instantly. We have to win. Gotta win. We have to win.
[29:06.770 --> 29:11.890]  Hey, Eric. Yeah? Just pooping. Check this out. It's pretty cool. Uh, hey...
[29:14.290 --> 29:15.410]  This is what we're gonna do to him.
[29:18.810 --> 29:23.170]  Ah! I spray, can you see that on Geoff? I do, yeah. Can you see that?
[29:26.410 --> 29:31.050]  Now I'm gonna, I'm gonna spray paint. Geoff, you can't see, I spray painted all over you.
[29:31.410 --> 29:36.010]  You're bright orange. Oh, we're, we're a go. We are a go. I can totally see a good person
[29:36.010 --> 29:45.780]  slipping through it. Okay, got a box that was doing that sneaky method to cross.
[29:46.260 --> 29:50.420]  Ah! We got concussed in here! Where'd he go? I don't know. He's a box though.
[29:50.960 --> 29:54.680]  Uh, a little wooden. I got some sandbags and they're running!
[29:59.250 --> 30:03.880]  Where the flipping? All right, he definitely left.
[30:08.000 --> 30:12.440]  So he can get up here. Yeah. Goddamn sandbag. I was shooting the same thing.
[30:12.740 --> 30:17.760]  No. Yeah, he got one.
[30:19.720 --> 30:22.600]  Where did that little prick go? Oh, barrel running!
[30:25.220 --> 30:26.460]  Barrel this way!
[30:28.580 --> 30:29.780]  There you go. There we go.
[30:34.040 --> 30:37.060]  I'm gonna check that spot that Anna was hiding in.
[30:38.500 --> 30:41.540]  Yeah, I found the sandbag there, but I, it got away somehow.
[30:50.050 --> 30:51.810]  You can play Flora's Lava in this map.
[30:55.390 --> 30:56.730]  I'm not seeing anything.
[31:00.230 --> 31:01.110]  If it's near you, indicate.
[31:04.980 --> 31:07.000]  Oh, it's over here. Left side?
[31:08.920 --> 31:10.880]  Pretty. One in here, I think.
[31:13.320 --> 31:14.400]  It's got to be up. Yeah.
[31:16.120 --> 31:17.240]  Up here somewhere. Where?
[31:21.960 --> 31:23.560]  Where? Where are they over here?
[31:32.920 --> 31:34.020]  Eh, no.
[31:36.380 --> 31:38.880]  Do you have those moments where you...
[31:40.320 --> 31:44.380]  They're both. Oh god, they're, they're, they're close over here, but I don't know where.
[31:47.620 --> 31:49.280]  Oh, killing me. Killing me!
[31:50.120 --> 31:53.740]  God, where are you, little ass? Got one. Why? Yeah?
[31:54.440 --> 32:00.180]  Oh, decoy. It was a decoy. Fuck. Damn. What was it? What was it? It was like a sheet. It was like a wooden sheet.
[32:00.740 --> 32:06.880]  Okay. Like a plywood? Yeah, plywood sheet. Got it. Nice. As soon as you said plywood sheet, I got him.
[32:07.340 --> 32:10.520]  Nice, there's just one left. That's why you gotta call out guys' communication, guys.
[32:11.340 --> 32:12.280]  Just one left.
[32:15.540 --> 32:20.400]  I didn't hear it. I think it's over near me, but I can't tell.
[32:26.200 --> 32:31.420]  Why does it feel like an eternity when you're the prop, but when you are shooting, it
[32:32.180 --> 32:35.900]  takes forever? It's some fucking bullshit is what it is. Okay, ready?
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.000]  Three,
[32:37.340 --> 32:37.860]  five.
[32:43.240 --> 32:48.120]  It's to the left. Yeah, it seems. Oh, you know what? Over here somewhere.
[32:54.280 --> 33:01.600]  Oh, this sucks. The worst part is we'll never know. Until we kill them.
[33:03.960 --> 33:08.260]  God damn, where were you, little prick?
[33:11.820 --> 33:14.140]  Fuck. Well, shit.
[33:20.210 --> 33:20.570]  Damn.
[33:26.630 --> 33:32.170]  That was a lot of fun, though. Yeah, there you go. Thanks for watching us play a little bit of Prop Hunt.
[33:32.490 --> 33:37.190]  I had a great time. Ooh, look, play of the game with Johnny Caviar himself. Nice.
[33:38.670 --> 33:43.490]  I think Prop Hunt with Falcons would be a lot of fun. Yeah. Oh, hell yeah.
[33:43.490 --> 33:46.670]  That's a fantastic idea. I think that would be great.
[33:46.790 --> 33:51.830]  And if you want to become a Falcon, you can over at patreon.com slash the regulation pod where we do
[33:51.830 --> 33:59.970]  monthly stream stuff or whatever with you. And you also could play this game with us or bean flicker or papa wheelie.
[34:00.150 --> 34:00.950]  Jesus Christ.
[34:01.910 --> 34:07.190]  All the heavy hitters. Yep. The finest. Yep. Well, guys, thanks for watching. Go check out the
[34:07.190 --> 34:13.210]  podcast. Go check out the Regulation Gateway channels on YouTube, and we'll see you next time. Bye!
[34:13.490 --> 34:14.650]  Bye bye. Bye!
