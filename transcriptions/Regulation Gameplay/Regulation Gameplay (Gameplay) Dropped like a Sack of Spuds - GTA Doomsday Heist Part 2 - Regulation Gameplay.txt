[00:00.000 --> 00:01.620]  We're back with more Doomsday!
[00:02.100 --> 00:02.520]  Whee!
[00:04.280 --> 00:06.000]  We're setting up...
[00:07.180 --> 00:08.020]  Signal interceptors!
[00:08.540 --> 00:10.200]  Alright, should we...
[00:10.200 --> 00:11.680]  How far do we go? Should we fly?
[00:12.880 --> 00:13.440]  Where is it?
[00:14.900 --> 00:15.320]  Um...
[00:15.320 --> 00:16.560]  Sure, yeah, let's fly.
[00:16.680 --> 00:20.540]  Oh my god, we should definitely fly.
[00:21.100 --> 00:22.420]  Oh, I can't spawn the chopper.
[00:22.540 --> 00:23.260]  I guess we're driving.
[00:23.340 --> 00:25.600]  Alright, driving is...
[00:25.600 --> 00:27.200]  I might be able to spawn something.
[00:27.800 --> 00:28.180]  Okay.
[00:29.200 --> 00:29.580]  Nope.
[00:30.720 --> 00:31.100]  Cool.
[00:32.640 --> 00:34.320]  Alright, let's see who wins the race.
[00:34.440 --> 00:34.780]  Alright, let's go.
[00:37.460 --> 00:38.380]  Do you need...
[00:38.380 --> 00:39.740]  Do you need it on the map, Gavin?
[00:39.860 --> 00:41.300]  Yeah, give us a mark.
[00:46.670 --> 00:47.910]  Here it comes.
[00:48.570 --> 00:49.330]  The mark is in.
[00:50.470 --> 00:51.230]  Way to go, buddy!
[00:53.030 --> 00:53.750]  You guys alright?
[00:54.130 --> 00:54.510]  No!
[00:54.510 --> 00:55.550]  Okay.
[00:57.350 --> 00:58.850]  I don't see any...
[00:58.850 --> 01:00.830]  Lines on the...
[01:00.830 --> 01:01.450]  Did you mark it?
[01:02.030 --> 01:04.130]  Just follow me! This way!
[01:04.270 --> 01:04.550]  This way!
[01:05.030 --> 01:05.590]  Go!
[01:08.070 --> 01:08.730]  Yeah!
[01:10.850 --> 01:11.090]  Okay.
[01:12.030 --> 01:13.050]  Where's Andrew?
[01:14.430 --> 01:16.050]  I'm trying to get the...
[01:21.150 --> 01:23.130]  Are we still following Nick?
[01:23.590 --> 01:24.590]  No, not really.
[01:25.050 --> 01:25.450]  Okay.
[01:26.630 --> 01:28.090]  I'll direct you from back here.
[01:29.270 --> 01:30.870]  You're kind of wrecking my back window there.
[01:32.230 --> 01:32.630]  No.
[01:39.320 --> 01:40.100]  Andrew, where are you?
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.100]  Why don't you just get in the car, Andrew?
[01:42.120 --> 01:43.980]  I haven't left the bunker yet. I'm trying to solve...
[01:43.980 --> 01:44.740]  I'm trying to call...
[01:45.620 --> 01:47.420]  I'm trying to fix things.
[01:49.900 --> 01:51.080]  Yeah, mutual insurance.
[01:52.740 --> 01:54.100]  You're calling mutual insurance?
[01:54.240 --> 01:54.340]  Oh, they're busy!
[01:54.480 --> 01:56.040]  They put me on hold!
[01:56.380 --> 01:57.360]  You're out of a job, son!
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.940]  Do I call you?
[02:00.760 --> 02:01.400]  Who are you trying to call?
[02:01.820 --> 02:02.260]  Fuck!
[02:04.580 --> 02:07.580]  Okay, my assistant has to know how to solve this.
[02:08.040 --> 02:10.080]  What the fuck is going on?
[02:11.020 --> 02:12.700]  Why are you busy too?
[02:13.180 --> 02:14.340]  You're out of a job!
[02:14.680 --> 02:16.060]  You're out of a job, son!
[02:16.100 --> 02:17.100]  No one's on the phone!
[02:17.100 --> 02:17.240]  Dude!
[02:19.180 --> 02:21.360]  I'm just calling 911. This is a real problem.
[02:23.560 --> 02:28.080]  If I have to fly back for you in the fucking DeLorean...
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.380]  Wait for your team to get in the Deluxus.
[02:31.680 --> 02:32.440]  Oh, God.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.400]  I'm on my way.
[02:37.040 --> 02:39.560]  Oh, cool, because I just got pitted to shit.
[02:41.800 --> 02:43.640]  Listen, I'm just trying to, you know,
[02:43.820 --> 02:44.880]  keep it even, Steven.
[02:44.880 --> 02:45.340]  Okay, you know?
[02:46.580 --> 02:48.580]  Yeah, you know how he's keeping it even, Steven, dude?
[02:48.900 --> 02:49.360]  Yeah, like...
[02:50.480 --> 02:51.040]  Oh, dear.
[02:51.720 --> 02:53.060]  There he goes, even Steven.
[02:55.100 --> 02:57.600]  Sounded like a treehouse full of chips
[02:57.600 --> 02:58.160]  folded over.
[03:00.320 --> 03:01.340]  How's it going back there?
[03:01.500 --> 03:03.080]  Andrew, got anyone on the line yet, or what?
[03:03.340 --> 03:04.980]  Well, I stole a Hummer
[03:04.980 --> 03:05.540]  on my way.
[03:06.560 --> 03:09.100]  I mean, there were a bunch of cars that were there.
[03:09.440 --> 03:09.660]  Yeah.
[03:10.140 --> 03:13.220]  I was walking forward while trying to get people on the phone,
[03:13.220 --> 03:14.420]  so I ended up away from all that.
[03:15.220 --> 03:16.600]  It worked, it worked.
[03:19.700 --> 03:21.120]  Oh, he's on our
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.840]  anus here.
[03:23.500 --> 03:23.980]  Guys!
[03:36.610 --> 03:37.430]  How's your health?
[03:38.150 --> 03:38.630]  Not great.
[03:39.290 --> 03:40.730]  Did you get tossed out?
[03:40.990 --> 03:42.830]  I tried to dive onto Nick, but
[03:42.830 --> 03:45.010]  the car spun around and I ended up
[03:45.010 --> 03:46.730]  smushed between the two cars.
[03:50.310 --> 03:51.830]  Oh, oh, oh!
[03:51.830 --> 03:52.450]  Oh, shit.
[03:53.950 --> 03:55.210]  Right into the fucking rocks.
[03:55.210 --> 03:55.670]  What did you try to do?
[03:57.430 --> 03:58.330]  He tried to cool someone.
[03:58.490 --> 04:00.970]  Try to make a shortcut? Take a shortcut?
[04:01.430 --> 04:01.910]  I'm not really...
[04:01.910 --> 04:03.830]  Oh, stop!
[04:05.690 --> 04:07.010]  He's stuck, he's fucked.
[04:07.570 --> 04:08.730]  Oh, it's so good, he's stuck.
[04:09.470 --> 04:11.270]  He's absolutely stuck, this rocks.
[04:13.850 --> 04:14.870]  I'm coming, Nick!
[04:16.810 --> 04:17.910]  I was trying to spawn a
[04:17.910 --> 04:20.030]  plane so I could fly us, make it easier.
[04:20.590 --> 04:21.630]  Yeah, no, we...
[04:21.630 --> 04:23.790]  Everyone was on hold, your assistant couldn't
[04:23.790 --> 04:24.330]  solve anything.
[04:24.690 --> 04:27.910]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:28.010 --> 04:29.690]  I think Gavin said, oh, you can't do that.
[04:29.830 --> 04:31.950]  It's not letting me do it. And then we got in the
[04:31.950 --> 04:32.670]  car and started driving.
[04:36.550 --> 04:37.330]  Is that what happened?
[04:37.970 --> 04:38.570]  Get out!
[04:41.790 --> 04:43.230]  Oh, she killed herself
[04:43.230 --> 04:45.310]  trying to get away. That's sad.
[04:46.130 --> 04:46.970]  Anyway, thanks for the car.
[04:48.230 --> 04:49.610]  Wow, we're like, just really
[04:49.610 --> 04:50.870]  kissing the rail here, bud.
[04:52.250 --> 04:54.270]  Let's try to two-wheel it a little bit.
[04:54.570 --> 04:54.890]  There we go.
[04:56.270 --> 04:57.010]  Oh, God.
[04:58.750 --> 04:59.730]  That was another door
[04:59.730 --> 05:00.550]  to knock on.
[05:01.910 --> 05:03.870]  I mean, I appreciate that you were worried about your
[05:03.870 --> 05:04.550]  back window, though.
[05:05.970 --> 05:07.810]  Well, that was before everything else.
[05:09.150 --> 05:10.250]  Yeah, we were still pristine
[05:10.250 --> 05:10.650]  in that one.
[05:13.090 --> 05:14.330]  Once the window went,
[05:14.430 --> 05:15.390]  the rest of it went, too.
[05:17.270 --> 05:18.450]  Oh, you're going up the hill?
[05:19.830 --> 05:20.350]  Hello?
[05:21.450 --> 05:21.590]  Hello?
[05:22.170 --> 05:24.510]  Who are you talking to? I said, are you going up
[05:24.510 --> 05:25.350]  the hill? Who?
[05:26.170 --> 05:28.670]  I don't know how that answers
[05:28.670 --> 05:29.590]  my question.
[05:31.050 --> 05:31.570]  Oh.
[05:32.530 --> 05:33.370]  No, Nick.
[05:34.070 --> 05:36.150]  Andrew, are you on a hill? No.
[05:36.650 --> 05:37.870]  What the fuck?
[05:37.910 --> 05:40.330]  I think I was totally valid in ignoring what you
[05:40.330 --> 05:40.710]  were saying.
[05:41.370 --> 05:41.890]  Hello?
[05:43.050 --> 05:43.370]  Hello?
[05:48.870 --> 05:50.710]  I think my internet's doing what Geoff's is doing.
[05:50.750 --> 05:52.910]  Hello? Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It must be
[05:52.910 --> 05:54.590]  the internet. That must be the problem.
[05:54.590 --> 05:55.750]  Let me rerun this cable across my house.
[05:56.650 --> 05:58.930]  Oh, yeah, we gotta see the cable run at Geoff's house.
[05:59.930 --> 06:00.750]  What would you name a porn
[06:00.750 --> 06:01.650]  parody of rear window?
[06:03.050 --> 06:03.590]  Back window?
[06:07.670 --> 06:09.030]  That's the whole point.
[06:09.630 --> 06:10.610]  No, I know, but if you
[06:10.610 --> 06:12.090]  had to do a good one.
[06:13.290 --> 06:14.130]  Yeah, what if
[06:14.690 --> 06:16.030]  instead of bad, you did good?
[06:16.770 --> 06:18.030]  A good porn parody of it?
[06:21.850 --> 06:23.770]  I would hire a specific actor, and I'd
[06:23.770 --> 06:24.730]  call it Richard Gere window.
[06:25.690 --> 06:27.530]  Wait for your team to get
[06:27.530 --> 06:28.850]  into a deluxo.
[06:31.670 --> 06:33.370]  If you guys hadn't made me take that shortcut.
[06:33.930 --> 06:35.270]  Yeah, why did we do that?
[06:35.550 --> 06:36.830]  My assistant would have picked up.
[06:36.830 --> 06:42.840]  Is this the place?
[06:44.140 --> 06:45.100]  Holy shit!
[06:45.100 --> 06:46.200]  Oh my god.
[06:46.480 --> 06:48.460]  Oh my god.
[06:48.780 --> 06:49.500]  You okay?
[06:51.100 --> 06:52.420]  Who are you talking to?
[06:52.500 --> 06:54.260]  This guy on the ground. Are you alright?
[06:55.460 --> 06:56.400]  Alright, he's alright.
[06:56.760 --> 06:58.800]  Did you double tap him with a silenced pistol afterwards?
[06:59.020 --> 07:01.440]  Yeah, just to be sure.
[07:02.540 --> 07:02.900]  You alright?
[07:03.020 --> 07:03.620]  Where's my car?
[07:04.620 --> 07:05.560]  Which one is yours?
[07:06.560 --> 07:07.180]  Oh, it's over here.
[07:17.460 --> 07:18.260]  1.32
[07:18.820 --> 07:19.860]  Sorry about that.
[07:20.140 --> 07:21.420]  Hey guys, come over here and
[07:21.980 --> 07:22.800]  help me out.
[07:23.860 --> 07:25.880]  He wants you to come help you out?
[07:26.300 --> 07:27.320]  Oh sweet, I gotcha.
[07:29.380 --> 07:30.620]  Wait, no, hold on.
[07:31.460 --> 07:32.720]  Put some of those on that.
[07:33.340 --> 07:33.660]  Okay.
[07:34.620 --> 07:35.560]  Load her up.
[07:37.400 --> 07:38.800]  You can put five on.
[07:39.800 --> 07:40.540]  Oh really, that's it?
[07:40.720 --> 07:40.860]  Yeah.
[07:41.640 --> 07:43.980]  Am I listening to back window right now?
[07:48.180 --> 07:48.920]  Oh, here he is.
[07:49.060 --> 07:50.180]  Oh shit!
[07:50.520 --> 07:50.660]  Oh!
[07:53.180 --> 07:54.820]  He landed on the guy!
[07:55.460 --> 07:57.420]  So we get out here, three pin, three pin!
[07:58.140 --> 07:58.700]  What are you doing?
[07:58.800 --> 08:00.460]  Get in the other car!
[08:00.940 --> 08:01.340]  Which one?
[08:01.740 --> 08:03.980]  This one, okay.
[08:04.700 --> 08:06.040]  Oh, that's fucked up.
[08:06.360 --> 08:06.860]  What do you mean?
[08:08.600 --> 08:09.560]  That's messed up.
[08:09.820 --> 08:11.320]  Call an insurance, anyway.
[08:11.580 --> 08:13.140]  You took like eight minutes to get here.
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.340]  Let's try to call my assistant.
[08:17.100 --> 08:17.700]  Where are we going?
[08:18.960 --> 08:20.180]  Oh, we have to follow targets.
[08:20.380 --> 08:21.000]  Alright, who wants what?
[08:21.120 --> 08:21.760]  I'm going to B.
[08:23.000 --> 08:23.860]  I'll do C.
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.060]  I'll get A.
[08:25.440 --> 08:26.840]  I just said I'm getting A.
[08:27.420 --> 08:29.460]  That's the first one to say it.
[08:31.620 --> 08:34.540]  He took the longest to get here and he's going to the furthest target?
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.040]  Are we sure?
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.840]  My name is fucking Andrew.
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.340]  I'm taking A.
[08:38.820 --> 08:40.280]  Alright, well my name is Nick.
[08:41.020 --> 08:42.860]  Wait, I'll go D.
[08:43.120 --> 08:44.120]  Where are you guys going?
[08:44.340 --> 08:46.400]  This is abysmal.
[08:47.100 --> 08:48.320]  That's the first one to yell.
[08:48.860 --> 08:53.120]  We all said what we were going to and then Nick wasn't paying attention to any of it.
[08:53.140 --> 08:55.660]  That's not true. I heard D and I heard B.
[08:55.940 --> 08:56.480]  Did you hear C?
[08:56.620 --> 08:57.180]  I said C.
[08:58.200 --> 09:00.940]  I heard C and I heard...
[09:00.940 --> 09:03.200]  We've got Andrew, Beric, Kevin and Dick.
[09:03.200 --> 09:05.100]  Ha ha ha ha.
[09:09.980 --> 09:10.660]  Andrew...
[09:11.500 --> 09:13.380]  Oh my god.
[09:13.780 --> 09:15.900]  These guys shoot you.
[09:16.220 --> 09:17.440]  Oh, I died.
[09:17.640 --> 09:20.100]  These guys shoot you crazy style.
[09:20.440 --> 09:21.220]  Two of you died.
[09:21.760 --> 09:22.440]  Wow.
[09:22.700 --> 09:23.760]  Gavin died too.
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.300]  You died too, don't you.
[09:26.980 --> 09:28.980]  I'll take the death. That's fine.
[09:29.100 --> 09:30.380]  I saw Gavin die also.
[09:30.380 --> 09:33.120]  That guy just starts blasting you.
[09:33.700 --> 09:33.740]  Wow.
[09:34.180 --> 09:37.500]  Yeah, I don't know whether to be to the side of the truck.
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.460]  Do I need to kill him?
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.380]  I tried to be to the side and his bullets were doing some like...
[09:44.960 --> 09:47.180]  Yeah, I was getting Morgan Freeman.
[09:47.940 --> 09:49.860]  Yeah, it really was like...
[09:49.860 --> 09:50.880]  That was nasty.
[09:54.460 --> 09:57.420]  Hey Nick, I'm going to B.
[09:57.780 --> 09:58.820]  Got it. I'm going to D.
[09:58.820 --> 10:00.020]  I'm going to C.
[10:00.820 --> 10:01.960]  What I could find.
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.000]  Oh, fucking hell.
[10:07.260 --> 10:07.720]  Ow, ow.
[10:08.660 --> 10:09.380]  Only one shot.
[10:10.040 --> 10:11.020]  Oh yeah, it's bad.
[10:11.460 --> 10:13.400]  Oh shit.
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.480]  Got fucking annihilated.
[10:16.590 --> 10:17.840]  Dude, I'm just like...
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.380]  Dude, just pulling the trigger doesn't seem to fucking matter.
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.400]  Use the rockets maybe.
[10:24.140 --> 10:24.960]  Use the rockets?
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.640]  So you want us to blow up the vehicle?
[10:28.320 --> 10:29.560]  It's armored. It'll be alright.
[10:29.620 --> 10:30.960]  Just knock the guy loose.
[10:31.620 --> 10:33.380]  I can't believe we're doing a little doomsday.
[10:33.560 --> 10:37.700]  Get bonus cash for it.
[10:44.150 --> 10:46.930]  If you kind of stay up in front...
[10:48.890 --> 10:50.510]  Oh yeah, if you stay ahead of it, you're okay.
[10:55.010 --> 10:57.810]  Because the driver doesn't seem to be interested in shooting you.
[10:57.810 --> 10:58.090]  Nuh-uh.
[11:02.780 --> 11:05.380]  Oh wow, and then you blow this thing the fuck up.
[11:06.000 --> 11:07.520]  Oh shit, I'm behind it again.
[11:08.300 --> 11:12.760]  Wow, as after you hack it, you blow it up.
[11:14.380 --> 11:15.160]  Holy shit.
[11:15.920 --> 11:16.600]  A cyclist!
[11:22.950 --> 11:23.750]  I got mine.
[11:26.250 --> 11:27.230]  You already finished?
[11:27.810 --> 11:29.050]  Yeah, how you guys doing on yours?
[11:29.650 --> 11:30.610]  Just working on it.
[11:30.610 --> 11:31.170]  Okay.
[11:33.830 --> 11:35.530]  My guy's being a little prick.
[11:36.550 --> 11:37.550]  Which letter are you?
[11:38.650 --> 11:39.210]  Cabin.
[11:39.930 --> 11:40.470]  Got it.
[11:47.560 --> 11:49.520]  The Deluxo was destroyed?
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.580]  Whose car blew up?
[11:52.460 --> 11:53.620]  The C4!
[11:53.900 --> 11:58.560]  The C4! Who put C4 on my car?!
[11:58.560 --> 12:01.220]  Someone threw a new C4 on my car!
[12:02.260 --> 12:03.000]  Who blew up the C4?
[12:04.460 --> 12:06.640]  Who blew my car up?!
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.680]  I don't know, because I'm going right to my car and doing this.
[12:10.960 --> 12:13.400]  Nick hasn't said a fucking word.
[12:16.720 --> 12:18.660]  We're a team, Nick!
[12:22.360 --> 12:24.180]  For what? Success?
[12:25.100 --> 12:27.300]  Contingency for if we're doing well?
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.800]  Yeah, you know what?
[12:31.040 --> 12:31.760]  I'm gonna...
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.320]  No, you...
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.000]  piece of...
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.080]  I didn't, listen, I just want you to know,
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.500]  I threw it, I didn't set it off though, they shot it.
[12:42.320 --> 12:43.360]  Yeah, I know!
[12:44.180 --> 12:45.160]  Okay, so you're
[12:46.460 --> 12:47.180]  absolved, or...
[12:47.180 --> 12:48.900]  Yeah, you know, in that I didn't,
[12:48.900 --> 12:50.400]  I didn't, you know, I may have
[12:51.580 --> 12:51.940]  inadvertently...
[12:51.940 --> 12:53.680]  There's a sentence in there somewhere, bud!
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.640]  Yeah, Nick, you know,
[12:55.200 --> 12:57.790]  I may have thrown it, but I didn't,
[12:58.220 --> 12:59.100]  you know, push the button.
[12:59.300 --> 13:00.680]  So really, it's your own fault.
[13:04.800 --> 13:05.900]  I shoved him off the cliff,
[13:05.900 --> 13:07.880]  but I didn't take his head and smash it
[13:07.880 --> 13:08.260]  on the rock.
[13:11.280 --> 13:13.480]  Andrew, if it makes you feel any better,
[13:13.620 --> 13:15.000]  I didn't expect that to work.
[13:15.440 --> 13:15.660]  Does it?
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.600]  Are you sure? Yup!
[13:18.600 --> 13:19.560]  Because, you know, okay.
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.960]  Really didn't expect it to work.
[13:23.080 --> 13:23.800]  Doesn't matter.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.060]  Sure did.
[13:27.300 --> 13:28.580]  Oh, you know what? That's pretty cool
[13:28.580 --> 13:30.400]  game design. I thought my life
[13:30.400 --> 13:32.520]  could contribute to cool game design.
[13:34.540 --> 13:35.440]  Nice work, man.
[13:36.480 --> 13:37.380]  No problem.
[13:39.580 --> 13:40.700]  You need no signal,
[13:40.800 --> 13:41.980]  I'm right fucking next to you.
[13:42.640 --> 13:44.240]  Why is my thing going so
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.560]  freaking far? What do you mean?
[13:46.560 --> 13:48.660]  My van is just hauling.
[13:52.480 --> 13:54.600]  Looks like D is ready to blow theirs up.
[13:55.800 --> 13:56.560]  And did.
[13:56.800 --> 13:57.500]  Nice, way to go.
[13:58.000 --> 13:58.360]  There you go.
[14:00.180 --> 14:01.140]  I have a lot of practice.
[14:02.900 --> 14:03.860]  How do you switch
[14:04.440 --> 14:05.320]  guns? X.
[14:08.460 --> 14:09.560]  Might be Y.
[14:10.300 --> 14:11.100]  Way to go, man.
[14:13.220 --> 14:13.660]  Ow.
[14:14.520 --> 14:14.920]  God.
[14:19.140 --> 14:20.120]  Who's left?
[14:21.320 --> 14:21.580]  Gavin.
[14:22.260 --> 14:23.260]  Sorry, Gavin.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.100]  Gavin.
[14:25.460 --> 14:28.200]  I can't believe that went off. I'm so excited.
[14:32.140 --> 14:32.820]  Ow.
[14:35.420 --> 14:36.100]  What?
[14:36.420 --> 14:37.280]  There's more?
[14:38.160 --> 14:38.840]  Shit.
[14:39.640 --> 14:40.580]  We gotta fly there, I think.
[14:41.160 --> 14:42.420]  I'm going D.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.000]  Oh my god.
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.280]  When does it turn on
[14:48.280 --> 14:49.660]  flying power?
[14:50.200 --> 14:50.840]  Oh no.
[14:55.580 --> 14:56.820]  I'm glad you asked that.
[14:56.920 --> 14:57.860]  I was about to hit a rock.
[14:57.860 --> 14:58.760]  I'm heading to B.
[15:00.520 --> 15:01.740]  Be there in forever.
[15:05.820 --> 15:07.220]  B for Beric.
[15:08.680 --> 15:09.200]  Dondarian?
[15:10.040 --> 15:10.560]  Yeah.
[15:15.960 --> 15:16.700]  Someone died?
[15:19.060 --> 15:20.060]  I didn't throw one
[15:20.060 --> 15:20.500]  this time.
[15:21.820 --> 15:22.340]  Andrew?
[15:22.940 --> 15:24.240]  You gotta initiate
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.080]  the hover before you hit the water.
[15:26.140 --> 15:27.380]  How do you hover? What do you do?
[15:27.840 --> 15:28.500]  Click A.
[15:29.660 --> 15:32.160]  It gave me the prompt while I was speeding
[15:32.160 --> 15:33.000]  into the ocean.
[15:33.880 --> 15:36.380]  Is there any reason why you were speeding into the ocean?
[15:36.980 --> 15:38.260]  Because that's where the
[15:38.260 --> 15:40.460]  thing was and I assumed it was a water vehicle
[15:40.460 --> 15:41.960]  and that there wouldn't be a...
[15:41.960 --> 15:44.240]  If they were gonna tell you to hover, they would do
[15:44.240 --> 15:45.920]  so before you're in the sea.
[15:47.460 --> 15:48.260]  The Delorean
[15:48.260 --> 15:49.820]  known for its submarine skills.
[15:51.200 --> 15:51.720]  Yeah,
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.340]  like they're known for their flying.
[15:53.720 --> 15:55.200]  What's your point, fucko?
[15:55.500 --> 15:56.840]  It does fly.
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.080]  It flies, it fights the future.
[15:59.460 --> 15:59.980]  Fucko.
[16:01.240 --> 16:02.220]  Yeah, come on, fucko.
[16:03.240 --> 16:05.700]  Everyone knows it's the Lotus Esprit that goes
[16:05.700 --> 16:06.180]  underwater.
[16:07.540 --> 16:08.440]  Everyone knows that.
[16:08.920 --> 16:09.380]  We're fine.
[16:12.500 --> 16:13.640]  I'm hovering now.
[16:13.780 --> 16:15.120]  I'm just gonna hover here.
[16:16.380 --> 16:16.860]  Here we go.
[16:17.760 --> 16:18.880]  You've already got it?
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.640]  Hold Y to hover. Oh yeah, you just hit A.
[16:21.300 --> 16:22.120]  I didn't have that.
[16:22.340 --> 16:23.280]  Me neither.
[16:24.700 --> 16:27.040]  I wasn't close enough to the water to activate this.
[16:27.160 --> 16:28.220]  Thanks, Andrew, for your powers.
[16:29.480 --> 16:30.900]  I'm hitting A, nothing happens.
[16:32.460 --> 16:33.060]  Press Y.
[16:34.660 --> 16:34.820]  Cool.
[16:35.120 --> 16:35.700]  You gotta hold it.
[16:37.280 --> 16:37.640]  Ow!
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.180]  Gavin, if you figure out the button
[16:44.180 --> 16:44.760]  will you let me know?
[16:47.060 --> 16:47.960]  Just tap it.
[16:47.960 --> 16:48.800]  Oh, right bumper.
[16:48.900 --> 16:51.640]  Thank you.
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.400]  I don't know why
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.740]  you'd want anything to be handbrake
[16:57.740 --> 16:59.560]  other than A. I agree.
[17:00.400 --> 17:01.060]  Right bumper?
[17:01.460 --> 17:02.740]  Right bumper handbrake?
[17:03.500 --> 17:05.740]  I just never use it.
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.180]  That's crazy.
[17:08.640 --> 17:09.820]  That's so nuts.
[17:10.440 --> 17:11.800]  I use right trigger to drive, left trigger
[17:11.800 --> 17:12.220]  to brake.
[17:13.860 --> 17:14.500]  Wow.
[17:15.260 --> 17:16.460]  Right trigger to drive,
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.560]  left trigger to stop driving.
[17:24.800 --> 17:26.280]  Why can't it fly though?
[17:26.360 --> 17:28.340]  It just barely
[17:28.340 --> 17:30.000]  goes off the ground.
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.760]  I think we have to finish this bit first.
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.740]  It's a slow rollout.
[17:34.680 --> 17:34.800]  Yeah.
[17:36.340 --> 17:37.720]  Oh, I can see four of me.
[17:37.920 --> 17:39.260]  Son of a bitch, who's sticking me?
[17:40.320 --> 17:40.760]  What?
[17:40.760 --> 17:42.240]  Someone put one on me.
[17:43.640 --> 17:44.760]  Oh, it's definitely
[17:44.760 --> 17:46.280]  Nick because he said what?
[17:47.620 --> 17:47.780]  What?
[17:56.810 --> 17:59.130]  Are there guys shooting at you in this one or no?
[17:59.250 --> 17:59.390]  Yep.
[17:59.930 --> 18:06.210]  Oh, it's not right on
[18:06.210 --> 18:07.070]  the windshield this time.
[18:13.660 --> 18:14.620]  Come on.
[18:15.060 --> 18:15.580]  He's done.
[18:17.180 --> 18:18.100]  Almost there.
[18:25.340 --> 18:25.780]  Boom.
[18:26.180 --> 18:27.860]  Me too.
[18:34.680 --> 18:36.180]  I'm the son of a bitch car.
[18:39.600 --> 18:40.040]  Nice.
[18:40.900 --> 18:41.720]  Oh, Nick.
[18:42.520 --> 18:43.320]  What happened?
[18:45.600 --> 18:46.940]  I might have messed up.
[18:47.300 --> 18:47.940]  Oh, yeah?
[18:48.420 --> 18:49.940]  You just went over there and blew him up?
[18:50.860 --> 18:53.280]  No, I tried to knock the guy down
[18:53.280 --> 18:55.100]  and I just unloaded a few too many bullets.
[18:55.520 --> 18:55.960]  Sorry.
[19:01.660 --> 19:02.460]  The little
[19:02.460 --> 19:03.440]  sorry at the end.
[19:03.580 --> 19:05.540]  I won't throw any C4 this time.
[19:06.180 --> 19:07.660]  That wasn't the problem.
[19:08.740 --> 19:10.060]  Don't blow up
[19:10.060 --> 19:11.180]  the vehicle this time.
[19:11.700 --> 19:12.120]  Okay.
[19:18.280 --> 19:19.560]  It'd be like if somebody
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.200]  burned all the... 100%.
[19:21.200 --> 19:23.340]  Gavin, if you weren't going to,
[19:23.420 --> 19:25.660]  I was, so I got no problem
[19:25.660 --> 19:26.680]  with that. Absolutely.
[19:27.740 --> 19:28.820]  It would be like
[19:28.820 --> 19:30.380]  if someone burned all the food and said,
[19:30.440 --> 19:31.920]  I'll season it better next time.
[19:32.400 --> 19:34.700]  That's great, but
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.020]  that had nothing
[19:37.020 --> 19:37.780]  to do with anything.
[19:38.920 --> 19:40.060]  What happened to the cars?
[19:42.240 --> 19:42.760]  Retribution?
[19:43.780 --> 19:44.780]  That wasn't mine.
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.380]  I didn't know we have cars
[19:48.380 --> 19:49.940]  that are specific to us.
[19:50.880 --> 19:52.440]  Yeah, they are. We painted them.
[19:53.100 --> 19:55.280]  I just run into the closest car.
[19:55.280 --> 19:56.680]  I don't give a fuck which one's chrome.
[19:56.960 --> 19:59.200]  I'm taking next car. You run into the chrome one
[19:59.200 --> 20:00.640]  every time. Really?
[20:01.540 --> 20:03.460]  It's probably because I'm the last one in the car
[20:03.460 --> 20:04.240]  most of the time.
[20:04.920 --> 20:07.360]  I'm taking next car. It's the closest one
[20:07.360 --> 20:08.580]  to me. This one.
[20:08.920 --> 20:08.980]  No!
[20:09.660 --> 20:10.100]  No!
[20:15.230 --> 20:16.470]  I won't let it.
[20:17.290 --> 20:17.530]  No!
[20:19.630 --> 20:20.970]  Oh, my door won't close.
[20:21.430 --> 20:22.350]  That's my retribution.
[20:26.050 --> 20:26.530]  Retribution!
[20:28.130 --> 20:28.610]  Retribution!
[20:31.290 --> 20:31.770]  Retribution!
[20:31.770 --> 20:32.370]  I can't believe that
[20:32.370 --> 20:33.750]  rocket didn't blow up your car, Gavin.
[20:34.210 --> 20:35.350]  We're on the same team, aren't we?
[20:36.850 --> 20:37.950]  Yeah, so why
[20:37.950 --> 20:39.790]  did my fucking explosive kill Andrew?
[20:40.010 --> 20:42.210]  Because someone on the other team shot it.
[20:43.090 --> 20:44.030]  How are you not
[20:44.030 --> 20:45.150]  putting this together?
[20:45.370 --> 20:46.750]  But it's still my...
[20:46.750 --> 20:49.670]  Maybe your rocket just hit the ground
[20:49.670 --> 20:50.550]  and knocked my car.
[20:51.790 --> 20:52.770]  Yeah, maybe you suck.
[20:57.030 --> 20:57.590]  Yeah.
[20:59.530 --> 21:00.550]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[21:05.250 --> 21:06.050]  Oh, shit.
[21:06.930 --> 21:07.910]  I am...
[21:07.910 --> 21:10.070]  Oh, this is so embarrassing.
[21:10.570 --> 21:11.330]  This is so bad.
[21:12.030 --> 21:14.570]  I just can't drive straight to save my life.
[21:15.090 --> 21:16.530]  I'm hitting every fucking
[21:16.530 --> 21:18.270]  dinghy. Oh, my God.
[21:19.050 --> 21:19.950]  You're hitting dinghies?
[21:20.690 --> 21:22.150]  I'm hitting... I'm in a dock.
[21:22.810 --> 21:23.890]  Can I get out of this?
[21:25.670 --> 21:27.410]  Am I stuck down here?
[21:31.670 --> 21:33.570]  When you're above the water, if you hold
[21:33.570 --> 21:35.050]  right bumper, you handbrake turn.
[21:37.650 --> 21:39.190]  Yeah, for you guys it would be...
[21:39.790 --> 21:39.990]  Yeah.
[21:42.470 --> 21:43.310]  Wait a minute.
[21:44.990 --> 21:45.950]  Oh, are you clever?
[21:46.130 --> 21:46.270]  Fuck.
[21:48.730 --> 21:49.970]  I might be...
[21:49.970 --> 21:51.290]  I mean, I'm stuck in the canal system.
[21:51.650 --> 21:52.050]  What?
[21:52.990 --> 21:54.490]  I'm stuck in the canal system.
[21:55.410 --> 21:56.810]  Can't spell canal without anal.
[21:57.690 --> 21:59.290]  I was gonna say, it's a good thing it's not pronounced
[21:59.290 --> 21:59.670]  canal.
[22:00.990 --> 22:02.350]  It should be pronounced canal.
[22:03.970 --> 22:05.050]  Why do you think it's not?
[22:06.030 --> 22:06.970]  Here we go to sea.
[22:08.730 --> 22:09.390]  If you
[22:09.390 --> 22:11.190]  stay a little... like a little
[22:11.190 --> 22:13.030]  forward on the boat, you can
[22:13.030 --> 22:15.110]  get it. It's not great.
[22:15.110 --> 22:16.950]  This is much easier than the other thing.
[22:25.180 --> 22:26.400]  He's done it again.
[22:27.680 --> 22:28.640]  Oh, I'm done.
[22:30.300 --> 22:30.800]  Hacking.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  I just
[22:33.600 --> 22:35.140]  ran this side of my boat and it
[22:35.140 --> 22:37.280]  capsized and then I hacked it while I was upside down.
[22:38.600 --> 22:39.100]  Nice.
[22:43.750 --> 22:44.250]  Alright.
[22:49.210 --> 22:51.030]  Oh shit, sorry guys.
[22:53.650 --> 22:54.170]  What?
[22:56.050 --> 22:57.150]  I just had an accident
[22:57.150 --> 22:57.810]  with some people.
[22:59.570 --> 23:00.090]  Okay.
[23:02.050 --> 23:02.790]  Now what?
[23:07.540 --> 23:08.140]  Come on.
[23:09.220 --> 23:09.900]  Oh, okay.
[23:09.960 --> 23:10.480]  Just one more spot.
[23:14.820 --> 23:16.100]  We're going to the airport?
[23:16.680 --> 23:19.780]  Are we gonna fly?
[23:20.100 --> 23:20.860]  And then we're going up.
[23:21.680 --> 23:22.500]  Hell yeah.
[23:24.240 --> 23:24.980]  You think
[23:24.980 --> 23:26.920]  that when we
[23:26.920 --> 23:29.260]  fly, we have a pilot's license
[23:29.260 --> 23:31.240]  for this or do we just need a driver's
[23:31.240 --> 23:33.140]  license? I think you're just driving.
[23:34.180 --> 23:34.420]  Yeah.
[23:34.680 --> 23:36.660]  There we go. I'm lined up. Look at that.
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.500]  Isn't that cool?
[23:39.600 --> 23:40.880]  Everyone do a little
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.420]  hover spin.
[23:50.860 --> 23:52.300]  This is awesome.
[23:53.420 --> 23:53.840]  Hurry up.
[23:54.340 --> 23:55.040]  I'm coming.
[23:57.080 --> 23:58.340]  You're missing the fun.
[23:59.100 --> 23:59.740]  This rocks.
[24:01.080 --> 24:02.080]  Wait, wait, wait.
[24:02.440 --> 24:03.140]  What are you doing?
[24:06.600 --> 24:07.840]  You got a runaway car.
[24:08.940 --> 24:10.920]  You have to go get your car. Oh, cool.
[24:11.860 --> 24:12.960]  Do you think
[24:12.960 --> 24:14.680]  you can run? Because we're
[24:14.680 --> 24:16.740]  pretty lined up. Do you think you can run on my car?
[24:18.880 --> 24:19.360]  Oh,
[24:19.400 --> 24:20.860]  that's so disorienting.
[24:23.280 --> 24:24.880]  You guys want to play air
[24:24.880 --> 24:25.160]  hockey?
[24:28.020 --> 24:28.980]  Go back
[24:28.980 --> 24:30.620]  to my car. Alright, let's go.
[24:30.800 --> 24:32.340]  You think you can get there? Hack the target.
[24:32.820 --> 24:34.840]  Oh my god, we have to hack again?
[24:35.340 --> 24:36.980]  Yeah, but this time it's the plane.
[24:39.680 --> 24:40.040]  Damn.
[24:40.420 --> 24:41.400]  Damn this car.
[24:46.120 --> 24:47.540]  We have eight minutes.
[24:47.540 --> 24:49.460]  The target is getting away.
[24:49.960 --> 24:50.780]  Like hell.
[24:53.600 --> 24:54.880]  The boost.
[24:55.600 --> 24:56.620]  Pull up, son.
[24:57.760 --> 24:59.160]  Time for deluxo.
[24:59.160 --> 25:00.580]  Oh, I have wings.
[25:00.940 --> 25:02.100]  Pull up on the sticks, people.
[25:02.760 --> 25:04.320]  Pull up on the sticks.
[25:05.820 --> 25:07.420]  It's not giving me a hover.
[25:07.780 --> 25:08.140]  Hover!
[25:08.860 --> 25:10.900]  You're driving using wheels.
[25:11.300 --> 25:13.900]  I hit hover. I'm hitting the button.
[25:14.020 --> 25:15.500]  It won't let me hover.
[25:15.500 --> 25:16.520]  What do you mean?
[25:17.260 --> 25:19.080]  I'm hitting the button.
[25:19.440 --> 25:20.560]  Oh my god.
[25:21.280 --> 25:21.820]  Nick!
[25:24.700 --> 25:25.480]  What is
[25:25.480 --> 25:27.780]  with you and blowing everything up?
[25:27.880 --> 25:29.000]  I didn't do anything.
[25:29.580 --> 25:30.720]  How did it even happen?
[25:30.820 --> 25:31.860]  It just banked hard.
[25:31.860 --> 25:35.000]  It turned sideways and crashed.
[25:35.020 --> 25:37.460]  Was someone under the wing pushing it over?
[25:37.900 --> 25:39.440]  No, I was on the ground
[25:39.440 --> 25:41.720]  jamming on the hover button and it wasn't
[25:41.720 --> 25:43.680]  working. I was right behind it.
[25:43.680 --> 25:45.480]  Could you see what made the plane tip over?
[25:45.640 --> 25:47.580]  No, all of a sudden it was just in
[25:47.580 --> 25:49.820]  pieces and I heard Nick, so I assumed
[25:49.820 --> 25:51.700]  it was Nick. It wasn't Nick!
[25:51.740 --> 25:52.780]  Wait, who's being quiet?
[25:54.560 --> 25:55.780]  I'm just letting people talk.
[25:56.200 --> 25:57.000]  Oh, okay.
[25:57.300 --> 25:59.120]  I yelled Nick. I was the first one to yell Nick.
[25:59.320 --> 26:01.500]  Yeah, you did yell at me
[26:01.500 --> 26:03.520]  for something I didn't do. I'll be the first to
[26:03.520 --> 26:04.260]  admit it sometimes.
[26:04.760 --> 26:07.900]  The first to admit it
[26:08.400 --> 26:08.800]  sometimes.
[26:10.480 --> 26:11.940]  You're a mess.
[26:13.680 --> 26:14.940]  Oh, I can take Nick's car again.
[26:21.560 --> 26:30.490]  Okay, now hover works.
[26:30.610 --> 26:30.750]  Great.
[26:32.590 --> 26:33.050]  Whoops!
[26:34.210 --> 26:34.790]  That was me.
[26:38.350 --> 26:42.010]  Alright, I'm going to stay
[26:42.930 --> 26:43.850]  not directly
[26:43.850 --> 26:46.410]  behind it, I guess. I'll stay off to the side.
[26:47.470 --> 26:48.430]  Let me get the
[26:49.490 --> 26:50.210]  freaking...
[26:50.210 --> 26:50.850]  There we go.
[26:51.430 --> 26:53.030]  Oh my god.
[26:54.150 --> 26:55.890]  Pull out the phone, moron!
[26:58.270 --> 26:59.270]  I'm on his back.
[27:00.890 --> 27:01.490]  I'm getting good
[27:02.130 --> 27:02.790]  cover. Oh!
[27:03.530 --> 27:06.070]  Oh, Gavin. I'm alright.
[27:13.030 --> 27:13.990]  I'm catching up.
[27:15.430 --> 27:17.030]  Someone's going the wrong way.
[27:20.520 --> 27:21.920]  Ah, come on!
[27:23.140 --> 27:24.120]  There we go.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.680]  There we go. Come on, boys.
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.200]  This is insane.
[27:29.460 --> 27:32.160]  This looks so crazy.
[27:33.760 --> 27:36.120]  Hey, how long do you think we have after we exit
[27:36.120 --> 27:37.880]  hover mode before we can re-enter it?
[27:38.080 --> 27:38.920]  I'm putting my wheels down.
[27:39.400 --> 27:41.260]  What? No, no, no, no!
[27:44.760 --> 27:45.880]  Gavin and I were driving
[27:45.880 --> 27:47.060]  on the wing for a minute.
[27:47.060 --> 27:49.980]  Oh my god!
[27:50.480 --> 27:50.680]  Helicopters!
[27:51.040 --> 27:52.920]  Why are there so many helicopters around us?
[27:53.000 --> 27:53.600]  Oh no!
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.340]  They're shooting!
[27:56.160 --> 27:57.180]  Oh god.
[27:57.680 --> 27:59.860]  I'll take care.
[28:02.800 --> 28:04.020]  Missile away!
[28:06.760 --> 28:07.540]  Missile away!
[28:07.700 --> 28:08.700]  68%!
[28:09.340 --> 28:10.980]  70%!
[28:13.200 --> 28:14.600]  I'm coming, Andrew!
[28:14.600 --> 28:16.400]  75%!
[28:19.860 --> 28:20.840]  Oh, we're getting ahead of it.
[28:21.720 --> 28:22.600]  We're going faster.
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.140]  It's pretty quick.
[28:29.240 --> 28:30.540]  I knew what he meant.
[28:31.360 --> 28:31.860]  It's instant.
[28:33.180 --> 28:33.660]  90.
[28:34.940 --> 28:35.400]  Come on.
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.960]  We're almost there. Andrew, look out!
[28:38.120 --> 28:38.400]  Be careful!
[28:40.100 --> 28:41.600]  Why won't it let me hack?
[28:41.600 --> 28:42.360]  97%!
[28:43.860 --> 28:45.140]  99%!
[28:45.880 --> 28:46.860]  Hacked it!
[28:48.080 --> 28:48.680]  Eat shit!
[28:50.040 --> 28:50.740]  God damn it!
[28:52.380 --> 28:54.100]  I'm getting shot in the air!
[28:54.200 --> 28:54.740]  What's happening?
[28:56.960 --> 28:57.600]  Helicopters!
[28:58.280 --> 28:58.800]  Oh no!
[28:59.100 --> 28:59.740]  Who died?
[29:00.620 --> 29:01.720]  Probably Gavin.
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.160]  That was a real pickle.
[29:05.300 --> 29:05.780]  That didn't happen.
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.600]  Look, I like this mission.
[29:08.600 --> 29:11.180]  I think it's pretty easy for the most part.
[29:11.260 --> 29:14.080]  I don't know what is wrong with you guys.
[29:14.200 --> 29:16.980]  I was trying to drive on the top of the plane.
[29:17.440 --> 29:19.100]  Oh, okay. I found out what's wrong with you guys.
[29:19.220 --> 29:19.500]  Thank you.
[29:20.400 --> 29:23.160]  When we shot down the plane, did you get blown up?
[29:23.940 --> 29:24.080]  No.
[29:24.300 --> 29:26.580]  He got blown up by the helicopters that just came through.
[29:27.040 --> 29:29.540]  I flipped. I was trying to put my wings out again, but I accidentally jumped out.
[29:29.740 --> 29:31.900]  And then I got shot by a helicopter on the way down.
[29:31.980 --> 29:32.500]  Eric, go to hell!
[29:33.300 --> 29:33.660]  No!
[29:34.720 --> 29:36.360]  I took Nick's car again.
[29:39.900 --> 29:41.860]  He tried to blow me up, but he sucks.
[29:46.060 --> 29:46.820]  Well, this...
[29:46.820 --> 29:49.060]  What kind of piece of shit is this?
[29:50.880 --> 29:51.260]  Chrome?
[29:51.780 --> 29:52.740]  God damn it, Andrew.
[29:54.340 --> 29:56.320]  I thought I was...
[29:56.320 --> 29:57.340]  Am I not in the Chrome one?
[29:57.980 --> 30:00.460]  He's probably in my Pearlescent one.
[30:00.840 --> 30:01.900]  Oh, yeah, I am.
[30:02.360 --> 30:03.840]  The Pearlescent one is pretty cool, though.
[30:04.280 --> 30:06.540]  The Pearlescent one is great. I just want to take Nick's.
[30:06.540 --> 30:09.220]  It doesn't have anything to do with how cool my...
[30:09.220 --> 30:10.100]  ...van is.
[30:10.380 --> 30:12.300]  I just want to take Nick's.
[30:12.700 --> 30:13.600]  Alright, is someone hacking it?
[30:14.300 --> 30:16.120]  I think we're all doing it.
[30:18.420 --> 30:19.820]  Who's blowing stuff up?
[30:21.000 --> 30:21.400]  Nobody.
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.320]  Okay, so it is Nick.
[30:23.800 --> 30:25.720]  The engine is smoking now.
[30:26.080 --> 30:26.740]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[30:29.320 --> 30:30.380]  Oh, make it slower.
[30:31.620 --> 30:32.100]  Oh, shit.
[30:33.140 --> 30:33.540]  Yeah.
[30:33.920 --> 30:35.620]  Once again, this is the seasoning thing.
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.860]  The problem was not that it was too fast.
[30:38.240 --> 30:38.500]  Uh-huh.
[30:39.620 --> 30:40.260]  We're fine.
[30:41.640 --> 30:42.820]  Alright, wheels down.
[30:46.120 --> 30:46.940]  I'm doing it.
[30:48.220 --> 30:49.720]  Nick, if you're that far back,
[30:49.880 --> 30:51.220]  can you just keep an eye out for the helicopters?
[30:52.000 --> 30:53.580]  Oh, Gavin!
[30:53.860 --> 30:54.500]  There goes Gavin.
[30:55.940 --> 30:57.480]  Here come the choppers. I got him.
[30:57.480 --> 30:57.700]  Okay.
[31:02.400 --> 31:02.900]  Sixty.
[31:03.780 --> 31:05.040]  Nice. Oh, that one's dead.
[31:06.260 --> 31:06.760]  Nice.
[31:07.300 --> 31:08.380]  Good shots, guys.
[31:11.220 --> 31:11.720]  Whoa!
[31:13.660 --> 31:19.680]  Got him!
[31:21.280 --> 31:22.720]  Andrew, I'd be worried about that wing.
[31:23.180 --> 31:24.080]  Just like that!
[31:25.260 --> 31:25.760]  Eighty.
[31:26.320 --> 31:27.420]  Right when I said it.
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.920]  Alright, I'm ready to obliterate this thing.
[31:32.920 --> 31:34.540]  Okay, we're getting there. It's close.
[31:38.420 --> 31:39.300]  Oh, geez.
[31:42.280 --> 31:43.680]  Oh, this looks so cool.
[31:44.480 --> 31:44.780]  Yep.
[31:46.080 --> 31:47.460]  Alright, here we go. You guys ready?
[31:48.020 --> 31:48.820]  Get away from it.
[31:49.100 --> 31:49.620]  Ninety-nine.
[31:52.040 --> 31:53.220]  Let her rip!
[31:54.200 --> 31:55.280]  Gavin, get away from it.
[31:55.900 --> 31:57.140]  Send it to hell!
[31:59.580 --> 32:01.660]  Okay, watch out for the helicopters behind us.
[32:01.660 --> 32:03.380]  Yep, he's going to delivery.
[32:06.820 --> 32:07.260]  Look at it go.
[32:08.000 --> 32:09.120]  I want to race it down.
[32:09.940 --> 32:10.240]  Nice.
[32:11.940 --> 32:17.660]  And we have a...
[32:17.660 --> 32:18.240]  Oh, shit.
[32:19.140 --> 32:19.620]  Who died?
[32:21.320 --> 32:24.120]  So I'm going to assume it was Gavin because he said, oh, shit.
[32:24.520 --> 32:26.000]  When it's so snowy,
[32:26.800 --> 32:28.600]  the water really comes up fast.
[32:32.100 --> 32:33.460]  You fucking idiot.
[32:36.280 --> 32:36.740]  Oh!
[32:38.320 --> 32:38.780]  Oh!
[32:42.520 --> 32:44.240]  It just looked really cool
[32:44.240 --> 32:45.740]  and then suddenly it was wet.
[32:47.060 --> 32:47.760]  Hey, Eric,
[32:47.880 --> 32:49.640]  do you want to just make a new team?
[32:51.180 --> 32:52.360]  You put Nick and Gavin
[32:52.360 --> 32:53.020]  on a squad.
[32:53.260 --> 32:56.100]  If we put Nick and Gavin on a squad, we'll never beat a heist.
[32:56.620 --> 32:57.720]  All bad ideas.
[32:57.920 --> 32:58.640]  The team.
[33:01.140 --> 33:01.740]  I'm taking
[33:01.740 --> 33:02.380]  this car again.
[33:02.380 --> 33:03.200]  No!
[33:04.020 --> 33:05.040]  Don't touchy!
[33:07.520 --> 33:07.920]  Alright, enjoy.
[33:07.980 --> 33:09.360]  I'm just taking my gold.
[33:10.020 --> 33:11.300]  Who done that?
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.240]  Falls too fast.
[33:19.690 --> 33:20.890]  Hacking again!
[33:29.510 --> 33:30.610]  What's going on
[33:30.610 --> 33:30.970]  back there?
[33:32.150 --> 33:34.710]  Nick put C4 on his
[33:34.710 --> 33:35.690]  car that I took.
[33:36.550 --> 33:37.570]  So, when
[33:37.570 --> 33:39.870]  I die, I'm just letting you know,
[33:40.010 --> 33:41.670]  when I die, just know that
[33:41.670 --> 33:43.350]  it is Nick who did this.
[33:43.790 --> 33:43.970]  No.
[33:46.050 --> 33:46.490]  99.
[33:47.890 --> 33:48.270]  Done.
[33:49.570 --> 33:50.730]  Go, go, go, go!
[33:53.570 --> 33:56.170]  Oh, that looked really cool.
[33:56.310 --> 33:57.410]  Now I'll drop with it for a bit.
[33:58.970 --> 34:00.270]  And now I'll pull my string again.
[34:03.610 --> 34:04.470]  Very cool.
[34:05.230 --> 34:05.670]  Nice.
[34:07.210 --> 34:07.870]  You got it, Nick?
[34:08.890 --> 34:09.670]  Uh, yeah.
[34:10.110 --> 34:11.850]  There he is.
[34:14.650 --> 34:15.090]  Got him.
[34:15.330 --> 34:16.450]  Alright, let's do it.
[34:18.250 --> 34:19.270]  I'm gonna get above land,
[34:19.610 --> 34:21.270]  go as high as possible, and see if I can
[34:21.270 --> 34:22.330]  do six front flips.
[34:31.110 --> 34:33.110]  I'm just gonna go to the drop-off, which is
[34:33.110 --> 34:33.790]  very close.
[34:37.130 --> 34:39.210]  Alright, well maybe you can watch the end of my front flip stunt.
[34:39.710 --> 34:41.210]  Yeah, maybe I'll get out and I can maybe
[34:41.210 --> 34:42.130]  get a good angle on it.
[34:43.150 --> 34:45.210]  We'll see it, and then we'll see it again when we have
[34:45.210 --> 34:46.330]  to do the mission one more time.
[34:47.690 --> 34:48.570]  How high are you?
[34:53.530 --> 34:53.850]  Pretty.
[34:55.430 --> 34:56.910]  Yep. I'm here.
[34:56.950 --> 34:58.610]  Have you reached the limits of the sky?
[34:59.290 --> 35:00.770]  I might be at it. Oh, I'm missing a wheel.
[35:01.950 --> 35:03.030]  I lost a wheel
[35:03.030 --> 35:03.950]  during that process.
[35:07.130 --> 35:08.110]  Alright, Andrew, you ready?
[35:09.490 --> 35:09.870]  Uh...
[35:10.830 --> 35:11.210]  Yeah?
[35:15.310 --> 35:16.870]  I don't know if I'm close,
[35:17.030 --> 35:18.650]  and I think I might need to get pushed.
[35:19.870 --> 35:21.150]  Oh shit, I'm doing way more
[35:21.150 --> 35:21.610]  than six.
[35:23.570 --> 35:24.570]  Oh, I've overshot.
[35:26.490 --> 35:27.250]  Did somebody
[35:28.190 --> 35:29.150]  land behind me
[35:29.150 --> 35:31.410]  and give me a little push? I don't think I'm in the range.
[35:31.930 --> 35:32.430]  What do you mean?
[35:33.430 --> 35:35.030]  My car is stuck.
[35:35.590 --> 35:36.690]  That's because it's got no wheel.
[35:36.870 --> 35:39.210]  Well, yeah, it's because you're there. I can't move mine either.
[35:39.710 --> 35:40.790]  Oh, wait, I can just hover.
[35:42.170 --> 35:42.550]  Weehee!
[35:44.550 --> 35:44.930]  Ow.
[35:45.770 --> 35:46.310]  Oh shit!
[35:46.810 --> 35:48.930]  Yeah, but hover doesn't do anything. I'm just hovering.
[35:49.030 --> 35:50.750]  Nothing's happening. You're spinning.
[35:51.130 --> 35:51.970]  Oh, it says you don't have a wheel.
[35:52.710 --> 35:53.710]  Oh, it's made me stop.
[35:54.350 --> 35:57.030]  It's stuck in the ground, which is why...
[35:59.410 --> 36:00.970]  Where's Gavin? Is he straight up still?
[36:01.790 --> 36:02.170]  Incoming!
[36:03.270 --> 36:04.150]  Oh, I'm getting back
[36:04.150 --> 36:04.710]  in my car.
[36:05.830 --> 36:06.730]  Oh, there we go.
[36:09.030 --> 36:10.230]  Hey, Andrew, what's your favorite
[36:10.230 --> 36:11.690]  part of that mission? Is it killing it again?
[36:13.210 --> 36:14.270]  Was that my car?
[36:15.530 --> 36:15.950]  Yes!
[36:16.350 --> 36:18.130]  What kind of stupid fucking
[36:18.130 --> 36:20.010]  question is that? It didn't blow up?
[36:21.850 --> 36:22.630]  What happened?
[36:28.240 --> 36:29.180]  I've never seen it.
[36:29.280 --> 36:30.140]  It didn't even blow up.
[36:30.140 --> 36:32.360]  It didn't.
[36:32.360 --> 36:33.460]  Was that someone else?
[36:34.460 --> 36:35.680]  No, it was you!
[36:36.520 --> 36:37.880]  I think it was Andrew's
[36:37.880 --> 36:39.260]  busted wheel off car.
[36:39.500 --> 36:41.800]  No, it was you! Really?
[36:42.360 --> 36:44.260]  I don't know why you think it was anyone
[36:44.260 --> 36:46.120]  other than you. Why would it be anybody else, man?
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.280]  It could have been my busted wheel.
[36:50.260 --> 36:52.100]  Your car hit the ground
[36:52.100 --> 36:53.080]  at full speed!
[36:54.780 --> 36:56.120]  Or it was the car
[36:56.120 --> 36:58.640]  that fell 300 feet from the sky.
[36:58.640 --> 37:00.980]  I took Gavin's car
[37:00.980 --> 37:02.220]  and me and Gavin
[37:03.200 --> 37:04.840]  were riding together.
[37:05.040 --> 37:06.720]  Wait, no, you have to take the other
[37:06.720 --> 37:08.640]  We need to deliver
[37:08.640 --> 37:09.700]  the other car!
[37:12.020 --> 37:12.700]  You gotta go
[37:12.700 --> 37:13.680]  get this car, Gavin.
[37:15.680 --> 37:16.540]  I'm gonna do
[37:16.540 --> 37:18.600]  six front flips. Oh, why did the car
[37:18.600 --> 37:20.520]  explode? What happened? It must have been
[37:20.520 --> 37:21.140]  Andrew!
[37:23.060 --> 37:24.480]  My car just bounced.
[37:24.700 --> 37:25.220]  It went... ow.
[37:25.220 --> 37:27.220]  It bounced and broke
[37:27.800 --> 37:29.340]  every piece of
[37:29.340 --> 37:31.300]  hardware in it. I still don't think
[37:31.300 --> 37:33.500]  that was me. Four wheels
[37:33.500 --> 37:35.440]  and a dead engine is still a not
[37:35.440 --> 37:37.280]  working car. Let's say it
[37:37.280 --> 37:39.160]  was me. Let's just say it was me.
[37:39.880 --> 37:41.300]  And it was from cumulative
[37:41.300 --> 37:43.480]  damage. It's still your fault
[37:43.480 --> 37:45.060]  for taking an unnecessary
[37:45.060 --> 37:47.080]  amount of time to just
[37:47.080 --> 37:49.260]  do flips for no reason. I don't deny
[37:49.260 --> 37:51.180]  that. And I'm like...
[37:51.180 --> 37:53.140]  Well, then what are we talking about? I'm like
[37:53.140 --> 37:55.180]  80% sure that was
[37:55.180 --> 37:57.020]  your fault. What?
[37:57.500 --> 37:59.620]  No! That's...
[37:59.620 --> 38:00.960]  We just
[38:00.960 --> 38:03.080]  outlined even if it was my car
[38:03.080 --> 38:05.120]  that exploded why it was your fault.
[38:05.420 --> 38:07.180]  And you're like, yeah, I agree
[38:07.180 --> 38:08.920]  with that. And then followed up with
[38:08.920 --> 38:10.960]  but it's your fault. Oh, I meant
[38:10.960 --> 38:12.280]  80% sure it's my fault.
[38:13.480 --> 38:14.780]  Oh, you're a...
[38:14.780 --> 38:16.920]  you're a... oh my god.
[38:18.420 --> 38:19.680]  I was trying to flip it
[38:19.680 --> 38:21.120]  and then I said it the wrong way.
[38:21.600 --> 38:23.000]  Did you get concussed
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.120]  in that fall? I did like 60
[38:25.120 --> 38:26.180]  front flips. I don't know.
[38:30.590 --> 38:31.290]  What's up, Nick?
[38:32.530 --> 38:33.290]  I hit
[38:33.290 --> 38:35.170]  A and was wondering what was happening. Nick was screaming
[38:35.170 --> 38:37.330]  and I immediately looked at the minimap to make
[38:37.330 --> 38:38.910]  sure we all still had cars.
[38:39.570 --> 38:41.190]  Here's what we should do. Oh, like I hit
[38:41.190 --> 38:43.030]  Y. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Just land.
[38:43.750 --> 38:45.190]  Yeah, what should we
[38:45.190 --> 38:47.090]  do, dude? Here's what we should do. If Andrew
[38:47.090 --> 38:47.870]  has four wheels,
[38:49.670 --> 38:51.170]  everyone go against the thing.
[38:51.170 --> 38:53.050]  And I'll do 50
[38:53.050 --> 38:55.310]  front flips and land and we'll see if it ends the mission
[38:55.310 --> 38:57.190]  and then we'll know it was my fault. Why don't we just
[38:57.190 --> 38:59.110]  end the mission? I'm just
[38:59.110 --> 39:01.130]  going straight to the point. I don't give a fuck about
[39:01.610 --> 39:03.170]  this. Well, you have to go straight to the
[39:03.170 --> 39:03.270]  point.
[39:07.570 --> 39:08.850]  Who the hell is still
[39:08.850 --> 39:09.710]  alive out here?
[39:11.410 --> 39:12.850]  I'm 80% sure it was my fault.
[39:14.670 --> 39:15.910]  I'm 100% sure.
[39:16.150 --> 39:16.710]  That is too low.
[39:19.590 --> 39:21.150]  Let's correct what you're saying once again.
[39:21.150 --> 39:22.730]  80% sure your
[39:22.730 --> 39:25.390]  car is the one that broke. 100%
[39:25.390 --> 39:27.190]  sure it was your fault. Yeah, there
[39:27.190 --> 39:29.170]  you go. Oh, you know what? Yeah, there you go.
[39:30.750 --> 39:31.150]  So...
[39:31.150 --> 39:32.990]  Because you may have hit Andrew's car
[39:32.990 --> 39:35.030]  and ruined it. Well, it's just if my car
[39:35.030 --> 39:37.130]  was slowly taking damage, you were
[39:37.130 --> 39:38.550]  delaying for no reason.
[39:39.070 --> 39:40.730]  So, how many front flips should I do this time?
[39:42.210 --> 39:43.010]  Zero. Zero
[39:43.010 --> 39:44.970]  front flips. Just land the vehicle.
[39:45.130 --> 39:47.010]  From the top of the map down with no flips.
[39:48.670 --> 39:49.270]  No.
[39:50.250 --> 39:51.790]  Just land it.
[39:52.110 --> 39:52.730]  Just land normal.
[39:53.170 --> 39:54.530]  Land like a normal person.
[39:54.830 --> 39:56.870]  Oh, it's a chopper.
[39:58.670 --> 39:59.190]  Okay, sorry.
[40:01.090 --> 40:01.830]  Apology not
[40:01.830 --> 40:03.470]  accepted. I was thinking it was Superman.
[40:05.870 --> 40:06.470]  Oh, there goes
[40:07.730 --> 40:09.230]  whatever his dog's name is.
[40:10.050 --> 40:10.730]  James Gunn.
[40:11.590 --> 40:12.670]  Dude, good one.
[40:13.590 --> 40:15.290]  What's his name? Crypto? The dog?
[40:15.290 --> 40:17.170]  Good one, Nick.
[40:18.950 --> 40:21.230]  I'm not versed in Superman lore.
[40:21.590 --> 40:23.210]  There goes his
[40:23.210 --> 40:24.610]  dog. Hey, Lyd!
[40:24.990 --> 40:25.370]  Hey, Gavin.
[40:26.410 --> 40:32.720]  Hey, we did it!
[40:33.880 --> 40:35.080]  Job well done!
[40:38.460 --> 40:39.700]  Oh my god.
[40:44.300 --> 40:46.680]  That was the craziest
[40:46.680 --> 40:47.380]  platinum.
[40:47.380 --> 40:48.620]  Okay, I thought
[40:49.300 --> 40:50.500]  Gavin or Nick was about to get platinum.
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.660]  That was awesome. That was absolutely
[40:53.660 --> 40:54.280]  fucking awesome.
[40:54.720 --> 40:55.800]  It didn't work!
[40:58.780 --> 40:59.500]  Also, I thought
[40:59.500 --> 41:01.000]  I was tossing a C4.
[41:03.880 --> 41:05.400]  Just a moron.
[41:05.420 --> 41:05.920]  Oh my god.
[41:06.780 --> 41:07.540]  Alright, let's do one more.
[41:08.680 --> 41:10.620]  I'm just driving my way to the bunker.
[41:11.040 --> 41:12.060]  I'll be there in four miles.
[41:14.220 --> 41:15.060]  Why are you driving?
[41:15.060 --> 41:16.580]  Why don't you fly? The one time
[41:16.580 --> 41:18.760]  you can fly and you don't call anyone,
[41:18.980 --> 41:19.400]  you just drive?
[41:19.800 --> 41:22.300]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[41:24.300 --> 41:24.760]  Time out.
[41:25.180 --> 41:25.660]  Okay.
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.780]  I was about to hop in a fucking helicopter
[41:28.780 --> 41:30.900]  and say, hey, could you drive to that?
[41:31.060 --> 41:32.740]  But then some fucking
[41:32.740 --> 41:35.020]  in it dunce man
[41:35.020 --> 41:37.400]  shot a rocket at the vehicle.
[41:37.540 --> 41:38.180]  I didn't shoot a rocket.
[41:39.540 --> 41:40.720]  Well, I didn't shoot a rocket.
[41:40.940 --> 41:42.420]  I shot a jolly bolly.
[41:42.420 --> 41:44.560]  A wally dolly bolly ball.
[41:44.960 --> 41:45.500]  Isn't it?
[41:46.020 --> 41:46.740]  Is that what you shot?
[41:47.600 --> 41:49.640]  Yeah, did you know what? Jolly wally bolly ball.
[41:49.760 --> 41:50.720]  I shot a rocket.
[41:51.440 --> 41:52.560]  Did you spawn that helicopter?
[41:53.680 --> 41:55.460]  No, but I was there.
[41:55.920 --> 41:57.400]  Well, just spawn one.
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.660]  Spawn another one in it.
[42:00.020 --> 42:01.500]  You can spawn another one.
[42:02.200 --> 42:03.120]  How do I do that?
[42:04.100 --> 42:05.820]  Remember when you were calling your assistant over and over?
[42:06.200 --> 42:07.040]  You don't even need her.
[42:07.700 --> 42:08.100]  Hold back.
[42:08.100 --> 42:08.900]  Hold back.
[42:10.540 --> 42:11.880]  That's what we were talking about.
[42:11.880 --> 42:12.440]  I landed it.
[42:14.880 --> 42:15.760]  Hold back.
[42:15.840 --> 42:17.880]  Oh, request a luxury helicopter for my assistant.
[42:18.060 --> 42:18.400]  That's cool.
[42:19.340 --> 42:19.760]  Oh, cool.
[42:21.860 --> 42:23.340]  I mean, it cost $5,000.
[42:23.740 --> 42:25.300]  I'm not going to do that often.
[42:25.680 --> 42:27.060]  Did you request a jolly bolly?
[42:28.120 --> 42:28.660]  Yeah, I did.
[42:29.540 --> 42:30.300]  That's a rocket.
[42:33.100 --> 42:33.320]  Alright.
[42:33.580 --> 42:35.200]  I've got...
[42:38.560 --> 42:39.800]  What are you doing?
[42:40.120 --> 42:41.140]  You know exactly what he's doing?
[42:41.780 --> 42:42.420]  Showing you this.
[42:44.320 --> 42:45.360]  It's a pretty cool car.
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.420]  Showing this.
[42:48.420 --> 42:49.540]  Are you serious?
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.780]  Did you call the helicopter or what?
[42:54.860 --> 42:55.180]  Yeah.
[42:55.460 --> 42:57.580]  I'm in a fucking helicopter being...
[42:57.580 --> 42:58.300]  Oh, they're driving.
[42:58.380 --> 42:59.200]  I'm drinking champagne.
[43:00.340 --> 43:02.260]  I'm drinking champagne in my helicopter.
[43:02.580 --> 43:03.460]  Executive, you getting in?
[43:05.160 --> 43:06.220]  Tell you what.
[43:06.220 --> 43:07.810]  Let's see how you survive this.
[43:09.060 --> 43:11.560]  I feel like a Roy child.
[43:12.520 --> 43:13.550]  It's like Succession.
[43:18.920 --> 43:25.530]  Ah, the chopper's here.
[43:30.600 --> 43:32.060]  Let's hop in this move.
[43:33.160 --> 43:34.000]  Sounds good.
[43:38.100 --> 43:38.880]  Daddy's in.
[43:39.540 --> 43:40.420]  Trying to get in.
[43:44.040 --> 43:44.560]  Oh!
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.280]  Come on, Andrew.
[43:46.520 --> 43:48.780]  Sorry. On my screen, I was not in.
[43:48.840 --> 43:50.540]  Then I was in, then I was hopping out.
[43:54.400 --> 43:55.300]  On my way.
[43:56.940 --> 43:58.660]  You did that on purpose.
[43:59.640 --> 44:00.200]  Yeah, he did.
[44:00.520 --> 44:01.460]  Yeah, he did.
[44:01.860 --> 44:02.240]  No.
[44:02.720 --> 44:04.800]  Can I land without wheels?
[44:04.800 --> 44:05.480]  Yeah.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.040]  Can you not hit me, please?
[44:09.220 --> 44:10.720]  Can you stop running me over, please?
[44:14.600 --> 44:16.360]  Why did you get out?
[44:18.820 --> 44:19.820]  There we go.
[44:23.980 --> 44:25.600]  This thing's nimble.
[44:28.320 --> 44:29.860]  This thing's smoky.
[44:30.440 --> 44:30.600]  Okay.
[44:32.180 --> 44:33.620]  Is this just...
[44:33.620 --> 44:35.400]  Hey, I'm not flying, just so you know.
[44:41.060 --> 44:43.320]  How do I turn on...
[44:43.320 --> 44:44.940]  How far do we gotta...
[44:44.940 --> 44:45.980]  Oh, we gotta go real far.
[44:46.580 --> 44:47.960]  What are you trying to turn on, Gavin?
[44:50.380 --> 44:50.740]  Well...
[44:51.840 --> 44:53.260]  He fucked the helicopter.
[44:53.580 --> 44:54.820]  He fucked it already.
[44:55.180 --> 44:56.160]  Yeah, I don't think it's...
[44:56.160 --> 44:57.660]  I don't think we're gonna make it.
[44:58.620 --> 45:00.380]  I mean, it's not showing any signs of turning off.
[45:01.560 --> 45:01.840]  What?
[45:03.960 --> 45:04.680]  I mean...
[45:04.680 --> 45:05.000]  Okay.
[45:05.460 --> 45:07.800]  The pilot has disabled stealth mode?
[45:08.180 --> 45:08.880]  Yeah, I don't...
[45:12.400 --> 45:13.900]  And did he do that on purpose?
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.320]  Or is that an effect of all the smoke that's shooting out of the vehicle?
[45:17.840 --> 45:18.880]  It's extra stealthy.
[45:18.920 --> 45:19.680]  It looks like a cloud.
[45:21.660 --> 45:23.400]  Is that what you think a cloud looks like?
[45:23.860 --> 45:25.020]  No, a rain cloud, maybe.
[45:25.060 --> 45:26.940]  I mean, the smoke looks more like a cloud than a helicopter.
[45:31.360 --> 45:32.800]  It looks like we're being escorted
[45:32.800 --> 45:34.620]  by the smoke monster from Lost.
[45:34.720 --> 45:36.720]  It wasn't a helicopter that killed Mr. Echo.
[45:38.780 --> 45:41.060]  How far? Oh my god, we have to go so far.
[45:41.260 --> 45:42.380]  It's really far.
[45:45.340 --> 45:46.300]  There you go.
[45:47.260 --> 45:49.240]  Land on the northern helipad.
[45:49.460 --> 45:50.300]  Don't fly too low.
[45:50.700 --> 45:51.440]  Flying too low.
[45:54.720 --> 45:56.520]  It wants me to land without going low?
[45:56.640 --> 45:57.280]  What do you want from me?
[45:59.260 --> 46:00.140]  Land. Just...
[46:00.140 --> 46:00.880]  Oh, okay.
[46:01.500 --> 46:03.020]  We're so fucked.
[46:05.960 --> 46:07.800]  What the fuck?
[46:08.720 --> 46:09.180]  You're out.
[46:11.540 --> 46:13.680]  How did you save that?
[46:13.900 --> 46:15.000]  That was crazy.
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.440]  We're not here yet.
[46:20.480 --> 46:22.040]  Use the ladder to get down?
[46:22.120 --> 46:22.820]  What if I don't want to?
[46:25.540 --> 46:27.700]  Should we do silence bips?
[46:27.700 --> 46:28.420]  Is that what it does?
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.080]  Yeah, I think so.
[46:39.580 --> 46:40.460]  I'm down.
[46:56.770 --> 46:58.910]  I took the camera out.
[46:58.910 --> 47:00.430]  Gavin committed suicide.
[47:01.390 --> 47:03.310]  I guess because Eric was on the ladder.
[47:04.370 --> 47:06.010]  It just walked around it.
[47:11.230 --> 47:12.390]  Chalk it up for me.
[47:12.670 --> 47:13.750]  I must have done that.
[47:14.490 --> 47:16.970]  80% sure it's Eric's fault.
[47:18.250 --> 47:20.770]  You know what? I'm really sorry for that.
[47:20.810 --> 47:22.050]  What were you pressing Y to get on?
[47:23.730 --> 47:25.210]  I just walked onto it.
[47:25.210 --> 47:25.430]  Oh.
[47:27.210 --> 47:28.290]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[47:28.350 --> 47:29.750]  I did that.
[47:31.790 --> 47:32.910]  My bad.
[47:33.610 --> 47:34.830]  I really apologize.
[47:35.370 --> 47:36.610]  Zoom in. Thank God.
[47:40.780 --> 47:42.280]  I'm going to watch and learn.
[47:46.180 --> 47:47.980]  You've done this before.
[47:48.600 --> 47:51.500]  You have the criminal mastermind's achievement, don't you?
[47:51.620 --> 47:52.200]  Not in this.
[47:52.300 --> 47:53.260]  I think it glitched out on us.
[47:53.260 --> 47:55.320]  It didn't work.
[47:55.660 --> 47:57.020]  Maybe they fixed it now.
[47:57.680 --> 47:58.440]  Press Y.
[48:03.120 --> 48:04.000]  Oh, shit.
[48:04.500 --> 48:05.280]  How did you do that?
[48:06.780 --> 48:07.860]  I'm walking up to it.
[48:08.260 --> 48:10.380]  I'm walking up to it.
[48:10.580 --> 48:11.540]  I'm walking here.
[48:12.980 --> 48:14.600]  I don't know what it wants from me.
[48:15.160 --> 48:17.540]  I just want you to know...
[48:17.540 --> 48:19.480]  I got such a good shot.
[48:19.660 --> 48:21.400]  I got such a good shot of it happening.
[48:21.400 --> 48:23.620]  He landed on that security guard.
[48:23.720 --> 48:26.320]  Just walking forward and flying right off the edge.
[48:27.500 --> 48:29.100]  Did I take you out?
[48:29.120 --> 48:30.740]  So this is part of that last video, huh?
[48:31.000 --> 48:31.400]  No.
[48:32.420 --> 48:33.700]  You're going down first.
[48:33.960 --> 48:36.500]  There's no point in me going down unless you go down first.
[48:36.900 --> 48:38.120]  I'll try to go down first.
[48:38.300 --> 48:40.280]  By any means.
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.840]  You've been going down by any means.
[48:45.280 --> 48:46.160]  Yeah, necessary.
[48:46.300 --> 48:48.260]  I think I've only gone down by one means so far.
[48:48.260 --> 48:48.560]  Alright, go.
[48:52.540 --> 48:54.020]  Alright, let's see him do it.
[48:54.200 --> 48:55.880]  Here we go.
[48:56.040 --> 48:56.440]  Walk up.
[48:56.800 --> 49:01.620]  Look, Andrew got it.
[49:03.900 --> 49:05.440]  What if the third one's...
[49:05.440 --> 49:06.300]  I made it, Eric.
[49:06.420 --> 49:09.980]  You made it look so easy.
[49:11.680 --> 49:13.140]  It turns out, it was.
[49:18.450 --> 49:19.710]  You can jump from there.
[49:23.150 --> 49:23.570]  Don't...
[49:23.570 --> 49:24.430]  try to coach me.
[49:26.790 --> 49:28.190]  Alright, Andrew, which one do you want?
[49:28.850 --> 49:30.010]  One on the left. Ready?
[49:30.790 --> 49:32.070]  Not yet, one second.
[49:32.230 --> 49:35.530]  He dropped like a sack of spuds.
[49:36.010 --> 49:36.790]  Nice, good work.
[49:36.890 --> 49:38.870]  I like that you didn't count down, you just said go.
[49:39.030 --> 49:39.510]  And shot.
[49:41.350 --> 49:42.430]  Right, ready?
[49:43.550 --> 49:45.330]  I got the one in the back.
[49:46.050 --> 49:46.470]  Okay.
[49:47.250 --> 49:48.290]  I said no!
[49:49.190 --> 49:50.290]  And then you kept
[49:50.290 --> 49:51.210]  saying okay.
[49:52.730 --> 49:54.350]  I said okay because he
[49:54.350 --> 49:55.090]  pulled the trigger.
[49:56.110 --> 49:57.390]  Get in the cover.
[49:59.830 --> 50:00.250]  It hasn't
[50:00.250 --> 50:01.050]  not worked yet.
[50:01.970 --> 50:04.090]  It hasn't not worked yet.
[50:04.290 --> 50:05.090]  What the fuck?
[50:05.290 --> 50:08.290]  Am I just gonna...
[50:10.530 --> 50:11.870]  Okay, it's 13 AM.
[50:12.530 --> 50:12.630]  Whoa.
[50:13.390 --> 50:15.050]  Are we killing both of these?
[50:16.330 --> 50:17.350]  Andrew, you...
[50:17.350 --> 50:17.590]  Okay.
[50:18.670 --> 50:19.990]  Hasn't not worked yet.
[50:20.370 --> 50:20.590]  What?
[50:23.330 --> 50:23.850]  What?
[50:24.090 --> 50:25.110]  Can you search him or what?
[50:26.910 --> 50:27.870]  Doing it, there you go.
[50:28.850 --> 50:29.710]  What's going on?
[50:30.390 --> 50:31.150]  Gavin, stop.
[50:41.080 --> 50:42.100]  Watch for the camera.
[50:42.800 --> 50:42.940]  Yep.
[50:44.440 --> 50:45.480]  Watch out.
[50:45.480 --> 50:46.260]  What?
[50:48.580 --> 50:50.700]  You piece of shit.
[50:51.120 --> 50:51.520]  Gavin.
[50:51.820 --> 50:55.240]  You fucking dumb
[50:55.240 --> 50:56.020]  asshole.
[50:57.120 --> 50:58.580]  That was poor.
[51:05.370 --> 51:06.800]  That was just genuinely not good.
[51:11.780 --> 51:13.320]  What's wrong with you?
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.060]  What is the matter
[51:15.060 --> 51:16.360]  with you, dude?
[51:17.800 --> 51:19.460]  And this is me asking.
[51:21.100 --> 51:21.460]  I thought
[51:21.460 --> 51:23.200]  I'd make a cool fire trap but then I forgot that it
[51:23.200 --> 51:24.360]  does eventually explode.
[51:26.120 --> 51:27.300]  I'm gonna do it all
[51:27.300 --> 51:27.800]  over.
[51:30.240 --> 51:31.280]  Hear the words.
[51:31.800 --> 51:33.360]  I'm officially, I'm taking a back
[51:33.360 --> 51:33.620]  seat.
[51:33.620 --> 51:34.420]  Laughing.
[51:34.940 --> 51:35.580]  Laughing.
[51:37.460 --> 51:37.840]  I'm gonna go back.
[51:43.890 --> 51:44.530]  Oh.
[51:45.090 --> 51:46.270]  You wanna stay on the roof?
[51:46.530 --> 51:46.990]  Laughing.
[51:51.170 --> 51:51.950]  I'm fired.
[51:53.650 --> 51:55.150]  Fireworks in the sky.
[51:55.690 --> 51:55.990]  Laughing.
[51:55.990 --> 51:59.190]  Oh, sorry guys.
[51:59.310 --> 52:01.470]  I'll take a back seat.
[52:01.830 --> 52:02.390]  Laughing.
[52:02.390 --> 52:03.250]  Laughing.
[52:05.430 --> 52:06.150]  Oh.
[52:07.590 --> 52:08.430]  It was
[52:08.430 --> 52:09.470]  going so well.
[52:10.470 --> 52:12.210]  Guys, I'm nervous about the ladder again.
[52:14.430 --> 52:15.150]  Laughing.
[52:19.150 --> 52:19.870]  Laughing.
[52:19.870 --> 52:19.890]  Laughing.
[52:20.210 --> 52:20.930]  Laughing.
[52:21.210 --> 52:23.750]  I didn't even think about it.
[52:24.130 --> 52:25.550]  I didn't even think about the ladder.
[52:26.790 --> 52:27.510]  Laughing.
[52:28.150 --> 52:28.870]  Laughing.
[52:29.550 --> 52:30.070]  Andrew.
[52:31.830 --> 52:32.350]  God.
[52:34.770 --> 52:35.290]  Laughing.
[52:40.890 --> 52:42.370]  Almost a really nice shot, Andrew.
[52:47.240 --> 52:48.600]  That didn't alert everyone?
[52:50.340 --> 52:50.640]  Nope.
[52:50.860 --> 52:52.420]  A little bit of fire did.
[52:52.600 --> 52:53.060]  That's crazy.
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.200]  A little bit.
[52:55.540 --> 52:56.200]  It blew up.
[52:58.500 --> 52:59.420]  Hold on, Gavin.
[53:02.100 --> 53:03.400]  Alright, who wants to shoot who?
[53:04.060 --> 53:04.740]  I'll get the guy on the right.
[53:05.640 --> 53:06.380]  Picking up the camera?
[53:06.820 --> 53:08.660]  Alright, 3, 2, 1.
[53:10.940 --> 53:11.460]  Beautiful.
[53:11.920 --> 53:12.400]  Did you get the camera?
[53:13.200 --> 53:13.720]  No.
[53:15.820 --> 53:17.320]  I've been shooting at it.
[53:17.740 --> 53:18.640]  I got it.
[53:20.180 --> 53:21.560]  Maybe your pistol's inaccurate.
[53:22.020 --> 53:22.380]  Maybe.
[53:22.380 --> 53:22.460]  Maybe.
[53:23.660 --> 53:25.260]  I'm going to get my sights looked at.
[53:30.760 --> 53:31.240]  Nice.
[53:33.620 --> 53:34.740]  Got the camera up here?
[53:37.060 --> 53:37.380]  Is this it?
[53:37.600 --> 53:37.800]  Yep.
[53:41.320 --> 53:42.280]  Please checkpoint.
[53:43.080 --> 53:44.180]  Please no more ladders.
[53:45.660 --> 53:45.980]  Yeah.
[53:46.220 --> 53:47.380]  Welcome to the ladder facility.
[53:47.420 --> 53:48.020]  Yeah, elevator.
[53:48.020 --> 53:49.380]  Oh, yay!
[53:49.820 --> 53:55.080]  Did we kill the scientist?
[53:55.240 --> 53:56.560]  I remember this being really difficult.
[53:56.620 --> 53:57.460]  Oh, shit.
[53:58.520 --> 53:59.920]  Wow, he was very loud and dying.
[54:03.140 --> 54:03.620]  Go on A.
[54:04.740 --> 54:05.220]  Gavin.
[54:05.880 --> 54:06.500]  I'll go B.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.740]  God, this is brutal.
[54:14.120 --> 54:14.840]  I got shot.
[54:15.220 --> 54:15.540]  Thank you.
[54:15.540 --> 54:15.900]  Bip.
[54:22.730 --> 54:24.250]  I'm going to D, by the way.
[54:24.810 --> 54:25.250]  Dick.
[54:26.530 --> 54:27.190]  You got him?
[54:28.810 --> 54:29.610]  That's a long room.
[54:29.830 --> 54:30.350]  I'm behind you, Andrew.
[54:30.810 --> 54:37.470]  Ah, they're going to make this room the morgue after this.
[54:37.790 --> 54:38.190]  Oh, shit.
[54:38.870 --> 54:39.410]  D is clear.
[54:44.190 --> 54:45.190]  Packing the server.
[54:48.450 --> 54:48.930]  Yep.
[54:50.130 --> 54:50.830]  Hacking A.
[54:54.890 --> 54:59.050]  Is there a, like, connect the selected node to the nodes to the right?
[54:59.190 --> 54:59.650]  Does it matter?
[54:59.810 --> 55:00.490]  Just trial and error.
[55:00.910 --> 55:01.090]  Wow.
[55:01.830 --> 55:03.350]  Every single one of mine was wrong.
[55:03.870 --> 55:04.630]  Holy shit.
[55:06.030 --> 55:06.270]  Yep.
[55:06.810 --> 55:08.930]  Oh, jeez.
[55:09.410 --> 55:10.990]  Wrong on all of them.
[55:15.570 --> 55:16.110]  Come on.
[55:16.290 --> 55:16.830]  There we go.
[55:19.830 --> 55:20.150]  Yes.
[55:20.790 --> 55:21.430]  But continue.
[55:22.650 --> 55:23.330]  Okay, I got mine.
[55:24.310 --> 55:25.030]  Oh, no, it's correct.
[55:27.110 --> 55:28.370]  One server's down. It's fine. I'm done.
[55:32.470 --> 55:33.050]  And I'm done.
[55:33.350 --> 55:35.150]  Do we escape the same way we came in, Andrew?
[55:35.210 --> 55:35.470]  Do you know?
[55:36.230 --> 55:37.150]  I believe so.
[55:37.370 --> 55:38.010]  Ah, shit.
[55:39.130 --> 55:40.330]  I'll wait for you.
[55:42.930 --> 55:44.090]  Oh, shit.
[55:44.210 --> 55:45.230]  Oh, balls.
[55:45.490 --> 55:46.210]  What happened?
[55:46.710 --> 55:47.770]  It's on C.
[55:48.490 --> 55:48.530]  Gavin?
[55:51.350 --> 55:52.350]  Gavin, I'm with you.
[55:52.510 --> 55:52.930]  Just in case.
[55:53.670 --> 55:55.630]  Gavin, did you just... What happened?
[55:56.070 --> 55:56.550]  I failed.
[55:58.430 --> 55:59.030]  What?
[55:59.290 --> 55:59.730]  Why?
[56:00.490 --> 56:03.970]  Gavin, how?
[56:04.030 --> 56:05.350]  It's just wrong so much.
[56:10.000 --> 56:10.840]  Oh, God.
[56:11.660 --> 56:12.360]  So, wait.
[56:12.480 --> 56:14.140]  Did you not hack your server?
[56:14.720 --> 56:15.840]  No, he hasn't yet.
[56:16.800 --> 56:17.880]  Let's just start again.
[56:20.900 --> 56:21.880]  Oh, I got two.
[56:22.300 --> 56:22.840]  Holy shit.
[56:24.180 --> 56:25.300]  Wow, way to go, buddy.
[56:26.360 --> 56:27.820]  I think I'm at the exit.
[56:28.280 --> 56:28.840]  Yeah, I'm coming.
[56:30.240 --> 56:31.380]  I'm defending Gavin.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.120]  I didn't know that was possible to fail.
[56:35.120 --> 56:36.120]  Either did I.
[56:37.720 --> 56:38.200]  Okay.
[56:38.580 --> 56:39.420]  You did it, Gavin.
[56:39.540 --> 56:40.020]  And there's cops.
[56:43.020 --> 56:43.820]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[56:44.400 --> 56:46.540]  Yeah, it's probably not a good idea to be in here
[56:46.540 --> 56:47.760]  because it doesn't actually do anything.
[56:48.020 --> 56:50.000]  Yeah, we should be in here.
[56:50.340 --> 56:51.340]  I think it's actually...
[56:51.340 --> 56:52.540]  It might be bulletproof.
[56:53.540 --> 56:55.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:59.590 --> 57:00.310]  Alright, I'm with you.
[57:00.870 --> 57:02.230]  We just have to watch the stairs
[57:02.230 --> 57:03.630]  and the guys down on the ground in front of us.
[57:04.610 --> 57:05.530]  Yeah, it's bulletproof.
[57:06.430 --> 57:06.770]  Oh!
[57:07.710 --> 57:08.190]  Oh!
[57:09.190 --> 57:10.150]  Nice shot.
[57:10.950 --> 57:11.850]  Should we run in?
[57:13.210 --> 57:13.530]  Yeah.
[57:13.690 --> 57:14.490]  What are you talking about?
[57:17.050 --> 57:18.010]  Come on.
[57:18.230 --> 57:18.850]  Come into the elevator.
[57:25.920 --> 57:26.800]  Alright, let's go.
[57:27.940 --> 57:28.420]  Nice.
[57:29.960 --> 57:30.840]  Is this the exit?
[57:31.260 --> 57:31.620]  Okay.
[57:32.520 --> 57:34.920]  We'll probably have to run back to our helicopter, I assume.
[57:36.260 --> 57:38.040]  Which hopefully is not smoking anymore
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.500]  because we've reset so many times.
[57:40.360 --> 57:40.840]  Yeah.
[57:41.260 --> 57:42.260]  Oh, God.
[57:42.700 --> 57:43.180]  Oh!
[57:45.520 --> 57:46.840]  It was just Gavin.
[57:53.550 --> 57:54.630]  Shoot, fool!
[57:55.610 --> 57:56.470]  Snack fool!
[58:04.950 --> 58:05.810]  This way, fellas.
[58:05.870 --> 58:06.510]  We can cut through the building.
[58:06.830 --> 58:09.410]  You guys will never believe what you have to do.
[58:10.370 --> 58:10.870]  Climb a ladder?
[58:11.970 --> 58:13.030]  Right behind you, Eric.
[58:13.390 --> 58:13.830]  Thanks, bud.
[58:15.550 --> 58:16.710]  We're at the helicopter.
[58:17.410 --> 58:18.570]  Alright, we're going that way.
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.230]  Probably on fire.
[58:25.440 --> 58:25.940]  Come on, Gavin.
[58:29.530 --> 58:30.370]  Gavin, I'm taking shots.
[58:30.550 --> 58:31.090]  I'm taking shots.
[58:32.850 --> 58:33.530]  Oh, ow.
[58:35.970 --> 58:37.010]  Trying to cover you from the roof.
[58:37.250 --> 58:38.430]  Alright, Gavin, remember, run to the ladder.
[58:47.430 --> 58:48.650]  Okay, helicopter coming down.
[58:48.970 --> 58:49.670]  Yeah, I see it.
[58:51.110 --> 58:51.630]  It is?
[58:52.830 --> 58:53.190]  Yeah.
[58:53.190 --> 58:55.530]  Are you guys on the ladder or what?
[58:56.130 --> 58:56.230]  Yeah.
[59:00.520 --> 59:01.540]  We're here.
[59:02.680 --> 59:03.560]  Get in.
[59:05.160 --> 59:05.820]  Roger that.
[59:12.740 --> 59:13.340]  Go!
[59:20.870 --> 59:21.510]  Am I flying?
[59:22.050 --> 59:22.350]  Yep.
[59:22.630 --> 59:23.230]  Yep.
[59:26.390 --> 59:27.190]  Stealth mode.
[59:33.530 --> 59:34.890]  How did I get out of this camera?
[59:35.050 --> 59:37.250]  Flew into the sight of these choppers.
[59:41.250 --> 59:43.930]  Good job on getting out and all that.
[59:43.990 --> 59:44.570]  That was smooth.
[59:50.230 --> 59:51.950]  Once Gavin solved his puzzle,
[59:52.050 --> 59:52.790]  we were all set.
[59:55.250 --> 59:55.970]  Fucking crazy.
[59:56.090 --> 59:57.730]  Well, I made up all the random connections
[59:57.730 --> 59:59.370]  and they were all wrong, and I did them again
[59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.150]  and they were all wrong.
[01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:01.270]  It's all wrong again.
[01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:06.230]  I think the odds of that
[01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:07.970]  are harder than solving it.
[01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:10.710]  I think you're right.
[01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.110]  Can we jump?
[01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:17.230]  No.
[01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:19.710]  I'm pretty sure I have to land this.
[01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.710]  You do.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.890]  Alright, I'll meet you down there.
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:28.650]  You haven't gotten out.
[01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:29.690]  I'm backseat.
[01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.270]  I'll jump if you will.
[01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:34.370]  Not now.
[01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:39.470]  You guys are fucking idiots.
[01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.430]  We're so close to the ground.
[01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.690]  We dropped very precipitously.
[01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:49.850]  Why are you trying to explain any of it?
[01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:52.210]  Guys, I didn't jump.
[01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:52.670]  It's okay.
[01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:54.090]  We did it!
[01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.130]  Yay!
[01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:00.870]  I was backseating.
[01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.410]  Now that's the end of the video.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:08.170]  Hell yeah!
[01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.050]  Level 40.
[01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:12.630]  Oh, you did it.
[01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:15.030]  Overcame our greatest obstacle,
[01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:15.530]  Gavin.
[01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:16.230]  Gavin?
[01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:16.710]  Yeah.
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.550]  So that's the end of this video.
[01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:22.230]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.830]  Make sure to check out our Patreon.
[01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.970]  We have a podcast channel.
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.470]  A regulation pod.
[01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.770]  We're doing all sorts of stuff.
[01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.470]  We do podcasts, we do drafts.
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.610]  We do agility races.
[01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:37.010]  That might be out.
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:37.630]  I don't know if it is.
[01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.210]  Anyway, check out our Patreon.
[01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.670]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.570]  We will be back with more Doomsday Heists.
[01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.470]  I'll be in a backseat position.
[01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:46.790]  Bye.
