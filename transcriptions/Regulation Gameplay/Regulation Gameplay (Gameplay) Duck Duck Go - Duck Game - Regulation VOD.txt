[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  This is great. Guys, how's it going?
[00:02.500 --> 00:04.180]  How's everything looking? How's it sounding?
[00:04.420 --> 00:06.760]  How's everyone doing? We're working on the 501.
[00:06.880 --> 00:07.580]  It's Friday.
[00:08.220 --> 00:11.840]  Nick has been bothering us for two weeks to play Duck Game.
[00:12.540 --> 00:14.640]  So we are playing Duck Game.
[00:15.020 --> 00:17.680]  It's his favorite Let's Play that was on the Let's Play channel.
[00:17.840 --> 00:19.260]  He said he wants to recreate it.
[00:19.540 --> 00:22.280]  He keeps telling us that he's the Aaron of this group
[00:22.280 --> 00:23.780]  and he can't wait to do this.
[00:25.720 --> 00:26.680]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.780]  All right. Everybody hop in the tube.
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.240]  Are we doing this thing?
[00:30.360 --> 00:32.060]  Yeah, we got to hop in the tube. Come on, man.
[00:32.120 --> 00:33.560]  We'll get started. I'm waiting for us.
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.600]  You get in the... Where's the hose tube?
[00:37.940 --> 00:38.980]  I'm the host. Get in the tube.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.860]  I'm sorry. I'm I'm doing a social disorder experiment. OK.
[00:47.750 --> 00:49.530]  Eric's just having a hell of a Friday.
[00:50.310 --> 00:52.570]  All right. So we all spawn multiple places on the map.
[00:52.750 --> 00:55.890]  And then you can, much like Mario, you can jump into stuff.
[00:56.430 --> 00:57.670]  And there's all these grenade launchers.
[01:00.390 --> 01:02.370]  Me and Andrew died. We're dead.
[01:02.770 --> 01:07.110]  Sib, you're back. Thank you so much for the gifted subs.
[01:07.110 --> 01:07.570]  Oh, my God.
[01:08.050 --> 01:09.010]  Always great to see you.
[01:09.390 --> 01:10.750]  Thank you so much.
[01:11.110 --> 01:12.290]  Oh, you killed yourself.
[01:13.050 --> 01:15.870]  Wow, guys, can you believe it? Nick won.
[01:17.130 --> 01:20.230]  Hey, shout out to Nick for getting these sick name birds ready.
[01:20.330 --> 01:20.910]  Look at those.
[01:21.410 --> 01:21.930]  Do they look good?
[01:22.130 --> 01:22.710]  Wait a second.
[01:23.510 --> 01:24.670]  Hey, you can fall down the middle.
[01:25.090 --> 01:26.070]  OK. Oh, yeah.
[01:26.210 --> 01:27.590]  Guys, you're not going to believe it.
[01:27.630 --> 01:28.410]  Nick wins again.
[01:28.930 --> 01:29.790]  Hey, I didn't do it.
[01:29.870 --> 01:31.930]  Oh, oh, it took us to the same map again.
[01:32.070 --> 01:32.210]  All right.
[01:32.350 --> 01:33.910]  This is like Towerfall, but I'm shit.
[01:35.370 --> 01:36.670]  Wait, this is just like Towerfall.
[01:37.550 --> 01:37.910]  Gotcha.
[01:38.210 --> 01:39.030]  Oh, I got him.
[01:40.390 --> 01:41.550]  I blew up Nick.
[01:41.650 --> 01:43.650]  I ended the rain and then...
[01:43.650 --> 01:44.950]  I'm dead. You're dead.
[01:46.130 --> 01:46.730]  We're all dead.
[01:46.770 --> 01:47.570]  You're dead. We're all dead.
[01:47.670 --> 01:48.850]  This is ridiculous.
[01:49.210 --> 01:50.190]  Did I get the window?
[01:51.250 --> 01:51.890]  I think so.
[01:52.430 --> 01:54.390]  Oh, the hammer.
[01:55.330 --> 01:56.090]  Get out of here.
[01:58.490 --> 01:59.330]  What's that about?
[01:59.850 --> 02:00.630]  Oh, my God.
[02:00.970 --> 02:02.030]  Oh, I just didn't get it.
[02:02.950 --> 02:04.990]  I just threw my gun without getting the one I wanted.
[02:05.330 --> 02:05.490]  Yeah.
[02:05.630 --> 02:06.810]  Whoa, you can get his burger?
[02:07.690 --> 02:09.010]  Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
[02:09.430 --> 02:10.110]  Is that a landmine?
[02:11.550 --> 02:11.790]  Yeah.
[02:12.550 --> 02:13.250]  How did I miss?
[02:13.410 --> 02:14.210]  I don't know.
[02:15.150 --> 02:16.090]  Get him, Robocop.
[02:16.150 --> 02:16.250]  OK.
[02:16.930 --> 02:18.950]  Having to reload is quite a...
[02:18.950 --> 02:19.870]  You have to run and slide.
[02:20.450 --> 02:21.730]  Oh, you have to run and...
[02:21.730 --> 02:24.230]  See, Nick knows all the tricks.
[02:24.670 --> 02:25.910]  He blew my gun out of my hands.
[02:26.670 --> 02:27.470]  Oh, my God.
[02:28.650 --> 02:29.090]  Shit.
[02:29.530 --> 02:30.210]  He's good.
[02:30.550 --> 02:31.790]  See, Nick knows all the tricks.
[02:32.430 --> 02:33.990]  I am not getting the hang of this quickly.
[02:34.270 --> 02:34.570]  No.
[02:34.710 --> 02:35.830]  Here we go.
[02:36.630 --> 02:37.810]  Oh, damn. I keep...
[02:39.390 --> 02:40.410]  Hey, we're doing a podcast.
[02:41.110 --> 02:42.530]  Oh, I lit myself on fire!
[02:42.870 --> 02:43.930]  I lit myself on fire!
[02:48.650 --> 02:50.890]  Welcome to Podcast Sometimes On Fire.
[02:52.770 --> 02:54.670]  Hey, we're doing a podcast.
[02:54.810 --> 02:57.110]  Oh, those...
[02:57.110 --> 02:57.610]  What's this?
[02:57.730 --> 03:01.230]  If you get the blue things, they're like little anchors.
[03:02.270 --> 03:02.670]  Yeah.
[03:04.470 --> 03:05.330]  Blew him away.
[03:05.470 --> 03:05.770]  Damn.
[03:09.220 --> 03:10.980]  Duck Game is crazy.
[03:11.420 --> 03:12.220]  You have to reload that gun.
[03:12.360 --> 03:13.080]  You have to reload that gun.
[03:17.620 --> 03:18.540]  Come get me.
[03:19.200 --> 03:20.340]  You didn't pull the pin.
[03:22.240 --> 03:23.100]  Wait, can that...
[03:23.100 --> 03:24.060]  What are you...
[03:24.060 --> 03:24.980]  Come get me.
[03:28.360 --> 03:29.320]  Oh, my God.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.180]  Friendly fire on those eyes.
[03:32.900 --> 03:34.400]  How do we get...
[03:37.200 --> 03:38.680]  Is this a one-shot gun?
[03:39.460 --> 03:39.760]  Yes.
[03:40.780 --> 03:41.100]  Oh.
[03:41.340 --> 03:41.820]  What the...
[03:41.820 --> 03:42.660]  Hey, you want to see something cool?
[03:43.040 --> 03:43.300]  No.
[03:47.220 --> 03:48.640]  You put me in a jar.
[03:48.860 --> 03:49.480]  What have you done to me?
[03:49.500 --> 03:49.920]  Die, you bastard, man.
[03:50.020 --> 03:52.000]  I just put you in a net, man. I shot you with a net gun.
[03:52.080 --> 03:52.960]  That's not cool, man.
[03:54.480 --> 03:55.440]  Eric wins.
[03:57.700 --> 03:58.960]  I'm the Highlander.
[03:59.400 --> 04:05.740]  So I think every ten rounds, it'll stop, show us who has the many wins, and whoever gets the ten wins.
[04:05.740 --> 04:07.060]  I don't think we need it to stop.
[04:08.020 --> 04:08.780]  Tell us.
[04:09.540 --> 04:10.520]  I think we know.
[04:11.700 --> 04:11.820]  Okay.
[04:11.940 --> 04:12.840]  Oh, my God.
[04:14.500 --> 04:17.180]  I got blown. Oh, my God.
[04:17.620 --> 04:18.780]  You got cowboy bebop.
[04:18.780 --> 04:20.520]  Oh, my God.
[04:20.520 --> 04:22.960]  This is insane.
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.060]  Guys, these are the guns from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. They move slowly like that.
[04:27.420 --> 04:28.100]  Oh, my God.
[04:28.280 --> 04:31.140]  I thought it was something to pick up.
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.680]  And then, yeah.
[04:32.940 --> 04:34.220]  And then Andrew, I think, just stood there.
[04:34.740 --> 04:35.700]  Who just gave me a turkey?
[04:36.680 --> 04:38.400]  That's us, dude. Those are us.
[04:38.600 --> 04:39.620]  Our gooses are cooked.
[04:40.680 --> 04:41.600]  Oh, you're a turkey.
[04:42.420 --> 04:43.160]  Well, we were.
[04:43.920 --> 04:45.320]  Oh, this is just a dart gun.
[04:47.300 --> 04:47.700]  Whoa.
[04:47.860 --> 04:49.380]  I'm going to kill you with the turkey.
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.380]  Oh, my God.
[04:50.480 --> 04:51.620]  Oh, my God.
[04:53.440 --> 04:56.100]  Have you guys listened to the kicker, picker, re-picker yet?
[04:57.140 --> 04:57.540]  Sorry.
[04:57.600 --> 04:58.240]  Yeah, what did you think?
[05:00.380 --> 05:00.780]  It's...
[05:01.800 --> 05:04.640]  That's the craziest thing I think we've ever recorded.
[05:06.660 --> 05:07.440]  It's unreal.
[05:08.220 --> 05:09.600]  Yes, I killed you with the turkey.
[05:09.940 --> 05:11.520]  You killed me with someone's...
[05:11.520 --> 05:11.720]  No!
[05:15.060 --> 05:17.300]  The wheel spin is nuts.
[05:17.700 --> 05:18.220]  Oh, shit.
[05:18.460 --> 05:19.780]  Did I put you to sleep or kill you?
[05:19.980 --> 05:20.560]  I died.
[05:21.060 --> 05:22.700]  Why am I going up?
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.000]  Yeah, I'm sleeping.
[05:26.660 --> 05:27.420]  I'm stuck.
[05:28.940 --> 05:29.340]  Ow.
[05:34.740 --> 05:35.360]  Wow.
[05:36.000 --> 05:36.900]  I have your body.
[05:36.900 --> 05:39.060]  So it's just surviving, not by killing.
[05:39.540 --> 05:40.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[05:40.520 --> 05:41.060]  What?
[05:42.400 --> 05:43.760]  It shows us how we're doing.
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.300]  Oh, I don't need to see this.
[05:47.220 --> 05:47.840]  No.
[05:48.560 --> 05:48.920]  Okay.
[05:49.380 --> 05:50.960]  All right.
[05:53.060 --> 05:53.680]  Okay.
[05:54.060 --> 05:55.100]  I'm getting it.
[05:56.040 --> 05:56.720]  We're getting there.
[05:58.520 --> 06:00.580]  Thank you so much.
[06:01.120 --> 06:01.740]  Thank you.
[06:02.700 --> 06:04.340]  Here's your Peebus the Jeebus.
[06:05.460 --> 06:08.600]  Oh, those helmets will protect you from getting stomped on.
[06:08.640 --> 06:09.580]  There's boots in this game.
[06:09.660 --> 06:10.580]  You can jump on people's heads.
[06:10.880 --> 06:12.420]  You can also drop rocks on people's heads.
[06:12.760 --> 06:13.080]  Like that.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.600]  Later, dipshit.
[06:19.400 --> 06:20.640]  I was just getting guns.
[06:22.340 --> 06:23.640]  Oh, my God!
[06:23.960 --> 06:24.820]  It's a die.
[06:26.240 --> 06:26.940]  Oh, my God.
[06:28.820 --> 06:29.260]  Or...
[06:29.840 --> 06:30.280]  Grenades!
[06:30.860 --> 06:31.280]  Launchers!
[06:31.280 --> 06:31.300]  Grenades!
[06:33.200 --> 06:35.160]  How do you pull the pin out of shit?
[06:37.420 --> 06:37.820]  Uh...
[06:37.820 --> 06:38.060]  Oh!
[06:38.940 --> 06:40.160]  Nick will never know.
[06:40.300 --> 06:41.080]  Oh, my God!
[06:43.160 --> 06:44.840]  No, it's right trigger.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.720]  Oh, you can shoot up if you're against the wall.
[06:46.740 --> 06:49.360]  Nick says it's right trigger, but we already know
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.560]  that he changed...
[06:51.560 --> 06:51.740]  Oh!
[06:54.920 --> 06:55.520]  I'm alive.
[06:55.920 --> 06:56.580]  Oh, check this out.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.300]  It's a flare.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.860]  Check this out.
[07:00.680 --> 07:02.000]  You killed me with a bow.
[07:02.300 --> 07:02.700]  Oh, my God.
[07:03.220 --> 07:03.640]  Oh!
[07:06.120 --> 07:08.160]  Oh, I lit myself on fire.
[07:11.540 --> 07:13.180]  The quacking at the end
[07:13.180 --> 07:14.020]  is so funny.
[07:15.340 --> 07:17.080]  I'm trying to remember who I am every time.
[07:17.280 --> 07:17.760]  Me, too.
[07:19.260 --> 07:21.220]  Why can't I throw the grenade?
[07:22.100 --> 07:23.000]  I pull the pin
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.100]  and then I just hold it.
[07:24.100 --> 07:25.960]  Nick was thinking with portals.
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.900]  Oh, yeah, there are portals, too.
[07:28.060 --> 07:29.600]  You didn't know you could kill me through a portal?
[07:30.480 --> 07:32.340]  No, I knew. I just forgot before you mentioned it.
[07:32.440 --> 07:34.020]  Dude, Jugs McTugs
[07:34.020 --> 07:35.860]  with the gifted sugs. Thank you.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.480]  Oh, thanks for the sugs, Tugs.
[07:38.580 --> 07:40.480]  Did you just get pushed off the edge?
[07:41.540 --> 07:42.580]  He hit me with something.
[07:42.940 --> 07:44.220]  Wow. I don't know what that was.
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.060]  That's a new weapon.
[07:45.540 --> 07:47.420]  That was not here the last time I played this game.
[07:48.860 --> 07:50.200]  How do you put it on?
[07:50.360 --> 07:51.060]  Oh, you just hold it?
[07:51.060 --> 07:52.480]  Yeah. No, no, no.
[07:53.240 --> 07:53.960]  Right trigger.
[07:54.120 --> 07:57.320]  You keep saying right trigger, but right trigger isn't the default thing.
[07:57.500 --> 07:57.940]  Then X.
[07:59.260 --> 07:59.700]  Woohoo!
[08:00.200 --> 08:02.260]  We already know to change your buttons, right?
[08:02.940 --> 08:03.920]  Right, so then X.
[08:05.100 --> 08:06.800]  Whatever your fire button is.
[08:07.040 --> 08:07.120]  Got it.
[08:11.400 --> 08:12.380]  Michael's Game Lab.
[08:12.620 --> 08:14.060]  Thank you very much for the gifted subs.
[08:14.240 --> 08:15.280]  Oh, thank you so much.
[08:16.420 --> 08:18.960]  Oh, damn. I thought you were out. You're never going to hit him.
[08:18.960 --> 08:20.920]  I'm going to hit a 900.
[08:21.460 --> 08:22.720]  Oh, you're out of ammo.
[08:23.680 --> 08:24.760]  How's the gun away with Y?
[08:26.040 --> 08:26.900]  Oh, you missed.
[08:27.000 --> 08:27.420]  You suck.
[08:27.920 --> 08:29.740]  Triple kickflip.
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.320]  I think they should just give this to Andrew by default.
[08:35.980 --> 08:36.580]  Gavin.
[08:38.700 --> 08:39.980]  Gavin, come on.
[08:40.520 --> 08:41.020]  Netcode.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.520]  Yeah, okay.
[08:44.520 --> 08:44.920]  Die!
[08:49.720 --> 08:50.760]  I stopped.
[08:58.400 --> 08:59.880]  Oh, a flower.
[09:00.620 --> 09:02.380]  You wouldn't shoot a man with a flower.
[09:03.620 --> 09:04.540]  A chainsaw.
[09:04.640 --> 09:07.080]  Why can't I throw the fucking thing?
[09:07.140 --> 09:07.980]  I'm hitting X.
[09:09.020 --> 09:10.640]  It's just a chainsaw.
[09:11.180 --> 09:12.700]  I pick up the thing, it doesn't do it.
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.240]  Try Y.
[09:15.140 --> 09:16.420]  Oh my god.
[09:16.420 --> 09:17.800]  You can slide around with that, too.
[09:17.880 --> 09:20.140]  If you hit down on the stick.
[09:20.800 --> 09:21.260]  I don't wanna.
[09:23.080 --> 09:24.260]  Stop chasing me.
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.600]  Oh my god.
[09:30.620 --> 09:30.860]  Hello.
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.680]  I took it from you.
[09:34.360 --> 09:34.700]  Whoa!
[09:35.620 --> 09:37.500]  I told you you could do that if you pushed down.
[09:38.560 --> 09:39.320]  That was pretty cool.
[09:42.280 --> 09:42.880]  Oh shit.
[09:42.880 --> 09:43.680]  Wow.
[09:43.820 --> 09:44.280]  Andrew.
[09:47.900 --> 09:48.520]  That's good.
[09:48.620 --> 09:50.540]  You stay on the other side of him, he's never gonna get you.
[09:50.680 --> 09:51.920]  Oh my god.
[09:52.040 --> 09:53.820]  I killed myself too fast!
[09:54.460 --> 09:57.160]  I bet you could pull yourself along the ground with a chainsaw.
[10:01.100 --> 10:01.580]  Supplemental.
[10:02.200 --> 10:03.600]  No, put running shoes on!
[10:09.170 --> 10:10.190]  Oh my god.
[10:10.790 --> 10:11.130]  Shit.
[10:11.990 --> 10:13.090]  What happened to Andrew?
[10:13.090 --> 10:15.410]  I fell into a room of spikes.
[10:27.430 --> 10:29.530]  Oh, we killed each other!
[10:31.310 --> 10:32.770]  Andrew didn't even have to do anything.
[10:33.690 --> 10:34.490]  Oh my god.
[10:39.290 --> 10:41.010]  There's a lot more space than I realized.
[10:41.010 --> 10:42.670]  I don't think...
[10:42.670 --> 10:46.650]  That was so quick.
[10:46.850 --> 10:47.910]  That was awesome.
[11:05.740 --> 11:07.500]  That taught me.
[11:08.240 --> 11:08.900]  I got one.
[11:08.900 --> 11:09.520]  Cheeky.
[11:11.480 --> 11:12.340]  Alright.
[11:14.640 --> 11:15.500]  Okay.
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.780]  Whoa!
[11:18.960 --> 11:20.500]  Anastasia, thank you.
[11:20.740 --> 11:22.000]  Thank you!
[11:22.300 --> 11:23.440]  Jesus, how many was that?
[11:24.590 --> 11:25.020]  25?
[11:25.580 --> 11:26.460]  Holy shit.
[11:26.560 --> 11:27.800]  Thank you so much!
[11:31.000 --> 11:31.860]  50?!
[11:32.870 --> 11:33.920]  That's insane!
[11:34.510 --> 11:35.060]  That's insane!
[11:35.060 --> 11:36.060]  Yeah, that's 50.
[11:36.420 --> 11:38.140]  Oh my god, thank you so much.
[11:40.380 --> 11:41.440]  Holy shit.
[11:43.260 --> 11:44.100]  What is this?
[11:44.160 --> 11:45.560]  That's our biggest one ever, I think.
[11:45.800 --> 11:51.060]  How do I...
[11:51.060 --> 11:52.560]  Oh my god!
[11:53.480 --> 11:53.860]  Who am I?
[11:54.080 --> 11:58.800]  Oh my god.
[11:59.880 --> 12:00.540]  Oh man.
[12:00.900 --> 12:01.520]  Oh boy.
[12:01.520 --> 12:02.540]  I'm like...
[12:02.540 --> 12:05.300]  Oh my god, you idiot!
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.120]  I think I hit like a...
[12:09.120 --> 12:10.320]  Espresso machine into you.
[12:10.480 --> 12:10.920]  What was that?
[12:13.700 --> 12:14.540]  Oh shit.
[12:15.880 --> 12:17.400]  That's like a big net gun.
[12:17.940 --> 12:19.160]  Did I kill someone with a net gun?
[12:23.380 --> 12:23.800]  Whoops.
[12:31.520 --> 12:33.060]  Oh, you can go through the tube!
[12:33.700 --> 12:34.160]  Oh shit.
[12:35.020 --> 12:35.860]  That's tubular.
[12:38.060 --> 12:38.900]  What happened?!
[12:38.900 --> 12:39.300]  What is...
[12:41.580 --> 12:47.900]  Oh, this is a sick shooter.
[12:48.080 --> 12:48.520]  Oh, come on.
[12:49.220 --> 12:51.580]  Come on, that was clearly what was supposed to happen.
[12:52.220 --> 12:52.540]  Oh my god!
[12:52.540 --> 12:55.320]  It was like, come on, god damn it, I'm dead.
[12:58.080 --> 12:58.500]  Ooh!
[12:58.500 --> 12:58.760]  Space!
[13:00.700 --> 13:01.300]  Pressies!
[13:02.800 --> 13:04.200]  Nah, too easy.
[13:05.340 --> 13:06.540]  Oh shit!
[13:10.500 --> 13:12.700]  In space, no one can hear you quack.
[13:18.700 --> 13:19.900]  What happened?!
[13:19.900 --> 13:21.820]  What is that?
[13:22.740 --> 13:24.600]  Oh, you have to like, hold it.
[13:24.900 --> 13:25.060]  Okay.
[13:26.380 --> 13:26.740]  Oh!
[13:29.420 --> 13:30.740]  I thought I could duck it.
[13:33.730 --> 13:35.330]  I mean, technically I did duck it.
[13:35.990 --> 13:36.410]  Yeah, I get it.
[13:37.850 --> 13:39.770]  What am I doing, am I reading hymns?
[13:39.870 --> 13:40.350]  What is this?
[13:40.570 --> 13:43.050]  Oh yeah, you can convert someone to be on your side.
[13:43.170 --> 13:43.630]  Oh shit.
[13:44.030 --> 13:44.310]  Read it.
[13:47.130 --> 13:48.450]  Now, even if...
[13:48.450 --> 13:50.090]  I think you get the win even if you die.
[13:51.690 --> 13:52.590]  Yeah, who wins?
[13:56.430 --> 13:57.510]  This is so fun!
[14:02.700 --> 14:04.520]  No, no, no, no!
[14:04.540 --> 14:04.880]  Welcome!
[14:06.780 --> 14:07.060]  Okay.
[14:08.700 --> 14:11.200]  That grenade did not work as I had hoped.
[14:11.980 --> 14:12.020]  Oh!
[14:12.800 --> 14:13.280]  Oh.
[14:14.180 --> 14:15.260]  I'm the Highlander.
[14:16.760 --> 14:18.940]  I'm good with swords and that's it.
[14:19.580 --> 14:20.300]  Ooh, swords.
[14:20.660 --> 14:21.940]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!
[14:22.280 --> 14:22.920]  Don't do it!
[14:24.100 --> 14:24.660]  Okay.
[14:24.660 --> 14:25.200]  Okay.
[14:25.440 --> 14:26.680]  Oh shit!
[14:31.840 --> 14:38.060]  Oh, you can see my little finger pulling the trigger.
[14:38.720 --> 14:40.880]  Oh, what are these bloody muskets?
[14:41.020 --> 14:42.200]  Oh, those are muskets.
[14:43.180 --> 14:43.360]  Ow.
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.020]  I suck so much.
[14:47.040 --> 14:48.100]  That's not a musket.
[14:48.840 --> 14:49.880]  Oh, you're lighting shit on fire!
[14:51.040 --> 14:52.560]  Was that someone pissing from up there?
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.620]  Yeah, I was pissing.
[14:54.360 --> 14:55.960]  It was a drum of gas.
[14:55.960 --> 14:56.880]  Look at that! Five!
[14:59.200 --> 15:00.900]  I think Nick won.
[15:01.160 --> 15:02.560]  Nick got nine?!
[15:03.500 --> 15:04.660]  Should throw my fucking
[15:04.660 --> 15:05.620]  burger backwards.
[15:06.140 --> 15:07.340]  Uh oh. Alright.
[15:10.200 --> 15:10.940]  Everyone's learned.
[15:11.900 --> 15:12.700]  Oh my god.
[15:12.860 --> 15:13.760]  This is pretty good, Nick.
[15:14.420 --> 15:16.120]  Dude, it's a fun, fun game.
[15:17.640 --> 15:18.660]  It's been a long time
[15:18.660 --> 15:19.240]  since I've played it.
[15:19.240 --> 15:19.600]  Ooh!
[15:24.060 --> 15:25.220]  I don't know why
[15:25.220 --> 15:27.200]  I wanted a magnet. It seems bad for
[15:27.200 --> 15:27.860]  people with bullets.
[15:29.100 --> 15:30.820]  Someone's alive. Who else is alive?
[15:31.060 --> 15:33.260]  No one's alive? Yes, we would have ended.
[15:33.420 --> 15:34.600]  Somebody's faking.
[15:37.680 --> 15:39.440]  I didn't know you could do that.
[15:39.700 --> 15:41.280]  Quacking on the floor was so
[15:41.280 --> 15:41.800]  funny.
[15:42.300 --> 15:43.100]  Right bumper.
[15:47.700 --> 15:49.820]  Hide Zeke, bro! Hide Zeke!
[15:50.040 --> 15:52.000]  I got you, bitch! I got you!
[15:58.440 --> 15:59.900]  Where are you gonna put him?
[16:00.860 --> 16:01.680]  There's no exit
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.560]  to the path! No, there's not
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.800]  on this one.
[16:06.080 --> 16:07.640]  You gotta let him go and get a gun.
[16:09.460 --> 16:10.480]  You gotta let him go and get a gun.
[16:10.480 --> 16:12.420]  You might drop him in front of a gun and grab a gun
[16:12.420 --> 16:13.080]  to shoot him.
[16:13.760 --> 16:14.820]  Where do I put him?
[16:15.900 --> 16:17.840]  Put him in the middle, then come get the gun on the right.
[16:17.920 --> 16:19.580]  It's a multi-shotgun.
[16:21.720 --> 16:22.440]  Oh, netted!
[16:24.280 --> 16:25.500]  Fake it now, bitch!
[16:25.960 --> 16:26.860]  Back of the head.
[16:27.500 --> 16:30.040]  Oh, you did.
[16:33.180 --> 16:34.260]  Oh my god!
[16:34.580 --> 16:35.220]  Holy shit.
[16:35.820 --> 16:38.040]  It doesn't matter, Gavin. Just stay alive. You're good.
[16:38.040 --> 16:40.220]  You idiot!
[16:41.660 --> 16:43.700]  Get a little snack. Eat my little burger.
[16:43.920 --> 16:45.960]  I was getting the books up in celebration.
[16:46.740 --> 16:47.300]  Moron.
[16:48.740 --> 16:49.780]  I'm learning stuff the
[16:49.780 --> 16:51.040]  freaking hard way.
[16:55.800 --> 16:56.920]  Oh god!
[16:57.620 --> 16:59.920]  The portal was taking all my bullets.
[17:00.600 --> 17:01.160]  Aw, Jay.
[17:01.440 --> 17:03.320]  A minigun. Oh my god.
[17:03.780 --> 17:05.620]  I'm Gavin in a GTA let's play.
[17:05.620 --> 17:06.400]  He's dead center.
[17:09.040 --> 17:11.320]  Guys, thanks for watching this stream.
[17:11.440 --> 17:13.340]  We do it every Friday if you're watching the VOD.
[17:14.240 --> 17:15.280]  Enjoying this a lot.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.500]  Duck Game has been really fun.
[17:17.780 --> 17:19.460]  And if you haven't watched
[17:19.460 --> 17:21.420]  the Kicker Picker Repicker, it's the
[17:21.420 --> 17:23.820]  craziest off the
[17:23.820 --> 17:25.620]  shit we've ever...
[17:26.260 --> 17:27.400]  Oh my god!
[17:28.020 --> 17:29.680]  How did that kill me through the
[17:29.680 --> 17:30.020]  glass?
[17:30.900 --> 17:33.320]  You can shoot magnum through doors and stuff.
[17:34.120 --> 17:34.680]  Oh.
[17:35.200 --> 17:36.580]  See, Nick, there's all the secrets.
[17:37.160 --> 17:39.200]  Yeah. He's cheating.
[17:39.960 --> 17:41.140]  Okay. What?
[17:42.520 --> 17:42.980]  Oh.
[17:43.260 --> 17:43.760]  Oh!
[17:44.920 --> 17:47.000]  One gun! Oh, come on.
[17:47.020 --> 17:47.940]  I got all the weapons.
[17:49.220 --> 17:49.880]  What's this?
[17:51.140 --> 17:52.920]  His body! His body's
[17:52.920 --> 17:53.580]  on fire!
[17:54.440 --> 17:57.000]  Die, die, die, die!
[17:57.020 --> 17:58.640]  I don't think anybody got anything for that.
[17:58.860 --> 17:59.440]  Damn it!
[18:00.460 --> 18:00.980]  What?
[18:01.540 --> 18:03.280]  I was hoping to find a bucket
[18:03.280 --> 18:03.720]  or something.
[18:04.040 --> 18:06.060]  Oh my god!
[18:06.840 --> 18:07.360]  Whoa!
[18:08.640 --> 18:09.800]  Is this a one-shot?
[18:10.300 --> 18:11.700]  You can reload it.
[18:12.800 --> 18:14.220]  I know you're alive.
[18:16.240 --> 18:17.440]  I don't even
[18:17.440 --> 18:18.080]  know how I died.
[18:19.200 --> 18:20.200]  I think we... wait.
[18:21.360 --> 18:22.600]  I think you're alive. You're alive.
[18:23.020 --> 18:24.580]  Oh shit, I'm alive!
[18:24.920 --> 18:25.760]  Oh god, I'm dead!
[18:30.160 --> 18:30.760]  Stay alive!
[18:30.780 --> 18:31.300]  Stay alive!
[18:31.700 --> 18:33.340]  If you just hold A, you could've
[18:33.340 --> 18:34.640]  floated maybe for long enough.
[18:34.840 --> 18:35.440]  Damn it!
[18:36.720 --> 18:38.620]  Where am I?
[18:39.300 --> 18:39.520]  Oh.
[18:41.440 --> 18:43.080]  Uh oh. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[18:43.780 --> 18:44.280]  Oh no!
[18:44.580 --> 18:47.380]  Oh my god!
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.500]  It's gruesome! You lived through that
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.540]  and then you died. Oh my god.
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.400]  Oh my god!
[18:55.400 --> 18:56.340]  I blew myself away.
[19:02.140 --> 19:03.500]  Gavin, did you have to do anything?
[19:04.040 --> 19:05.340]  Well, I put Nick in there.
[19:06.080 --> 19:07.240]  That was incredible.
[19:07.920 --> 19:08.720]  Where am I? Oh yeah.
[19:09.260 --> 19:09.620]  Flip us!
[19:10.900 --> 19:11.200]  No!
[19:13.340 --> 19:14.620]  What? Andrew crashed.
[19:15.500 --> 19:16.920]  Unfortunately, it dug in to stop working.
[19:17.900 --> 19:18.020]  What?
[19:19.020 --> 19:21.200]  I like that it dogged in. It said your game
[19:21.200 --> 19:22.700]  crashed to everyone. Gotcha!
[19:25.420 --> 19:25.880]  Andrew!
[19:26.580 --> 19:28.520]  I think we're almost done.
[19:29.300 --> 19:30.580]  Yeah, this is probably the
[19:30.580 --> 19:30.780]  best.
[19:32.360 --> 19:32.820]  Oh!
[19:34.700 --> 19:35.760]  Did that get you?
[19:36.320 --> 19:37.780]  It did. I didn't think it would.
[19:38.120 --> 19:38.860]  I didn't think it would either.
[19:40.820 --> 19:41.280]  Oh!
[19:42.680 --> 19:43.140]  Oh.
[19:44.820 --> 19:45.280]  Oh!
[19:50.200 --> 19:50.380]  Oh!
[19:50.380 --> 19:50.460]  Oh!
[19:51.280 --> 19:51.760]  Oh!
[19:53.700 --> 20:00.170]  Alright, it looks like we're at the last intermission
[20:00.170 --> 20:01.610]  because Nick's going to win here.
[20:01.850 --> 20:02.670]  Oh my god!
[20:02.890 --> 20:05.430]  Which I feel really good about.
[20:05.950 --> 20:07.530]  The quack? Yeah.
[20:10.430 --> 20:11.090]  Oh, okay.
[20:11.830 --> 20:13.190]  Could it be a tie? No!
[20:13.990 --> 20:15.070]  Oh, it was close though.
[20:18.350 --> 20:18.830]  Boo!
[20:18.830 --> 20:19.450]  Boo!
[20:20.090 --> 20:21.450]  Skip! Boo!
[20:22.190 --> 20:23.610]  So we're two for three on
[20:24.650 --> 20:26.550]  Andrew's shit falling apart in a stream.
[20:26.770 --> 20:28.350]  Yeah, pretty good.
[20:28.790 --> 20:29.630]  Hey, yeah, how was
[20:31.030 --> 20:32.630]  how did Gears of War
[20:32.630 --> 20:33.350]  go earlier today?
[20:34.970 --> 20:35.950]  Oh, it was long.
[20:37.810 --> 20:38.690]  Each part is
[20:38.690 --> 20:40.790]  averaging about two hours. Oh my god.
[20:42.050 --> 20:42.810]  It says
[20:42.810 --> 20:43.730]  that we're waiting on Andrew.
[20:44.690 --> 20:45.290]  I'm waiting for him.
[20:46.090 --> 20:46.950]  I'll send you one.
[20:46.990 --> 20:48.350]  You might have one still.
[20:49.950 --> 20:50.890]  There you go.
[20:51.010 --> 20:51.850]  Got that one.
[20:52.370 --> 20:55.070]  We're playing this puppy all the way until 5-0-1.
[20:55.770 --> 20:57.270]  5-0-1.
[20:57.670 --> 20:57.910]  Oops.
[21:00.710 --> 21:01.330]  Do Metal Slug
[21:01.330 --> 21:03.330]  tactics. Metal Slug
[21:03.330 --> 21:05.450]  tactics came out today and it makes me feel so
[21:05.450 --> 21:07.070]  stupid. It is
[21:07.070 --> 21:08.230]  so hard.
[21:08.790 --> 21:10.830]  What is it called? Metal Slug
[21:10.830 --> 21:12.710]  tactics. You know those Metal Slug games like the
[21:12.710 --> 21:14.030]  side-scrollers, the SNK games?
[21:14.290 --> 21:15.830]  They made a tactics-based game
[21:16.610 --> 21:18.410]  using that IP and it's really fun.
[21:18.690 --> 21:20.630]  And I love Metal Slug but dude, it
[21:20.630 --> 21:22.590]  makes me feel dumb as fuck.
[21:22.770 --> 21:23.850]  Like a turn-based thing?
[21:24.670 --> 21:26.530]  Yeah, just like any of those
[21:26.530 --> 21:28.430]  tactics-style games.
[21:28.890 --> 21:30.810]  That was a good Gears of War one.
[21:31.370 --> 21:31.790]  Oh, cool.
[21:32.610 --> 21:33.730]  Alright, let's do it.
[21:34.510 --> 21:35.890]  I upped random maps.
[21:36.270 --> 21:37.250]  Oh, cool. Yeah.
[21:38.310 --> 21:39.570]  I like the random...
[21:39.570 --> 21:41.190]  The more different the better.
[21:42.130 --> 21:43.150]  Alright, so armor up.
[21:43.610 --> 21:45.670]  And we'll have a good old joust.
[21:46.890 --> 21:47.150]  Yah!
[21:50.110 --> 21:50.650]  Or...
[21:50.650 --> 21:51.930]  Hell yeah!
[21:52.310 --> 21:53.050]  Hell yeah!
[21:53.410 --> 21:55.170]  Hell yeah! Die!
[21:56.110 --> 21:56.650]  Die!
[21:58.470 --> 21:59.550]  You moron!
[22:00.230 --> 22:01.430]  I've killed us both, Eric!
[22:01.590 --> 22:03.130]  I'm gonna mash faster than you!
[22:03.370 --> 22:04.530]  Die, you son of a bitch!
[22:04.690 --> 22:05.910]  I'm gonna get you!
[22:12.130 --> 22:13.250]  What's going on?
[22:14.050 --> 22:15.110]  What's happening?
[22:15.530 --> 22:17.070]  It used to go through the armor.
[22:17.430 --> 22:18.850]  Somebody go get the magnet.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.540]  Oh, what's that?
[22:25.640 --> 22:26.320]  Is that a landmine?
[22:31.460 --> 22:35.780]  Oh my god.
[22:36.020 --> 22:36.820]  Oh my god.
[22:37.700 --> 22:39.560]  What are you doing?
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.300]  Ow.
[22:42.300 --> 22:44.620]  What are you doing?
[22:44.880 --> 22:46.140]  It was flashing red!
[22:46.580 --> 22:47.840]  I don't... Listen, I didn't see it.
[22:49.080 --> 22:50.240]  Oh, the game was apparently called
[22:50.240 --> 22:51.700]  Gears of War Tactics.
[22:52.120 --> 22:52.680]  Oh, is that it?
[22:53.920 --> 22:54.440]  Oh!
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.060]  Oh shit!
[23:00.720 --> 23:02.040]  Yeah, you better duck.
[23:03.020 --> 23:04.280]  It just opens the door
[23:04.280 --> 23:05.960]  to get blown away by a shotgun.
[23:08.960 --> 23:09.720]  That's for you.
[23:09.720 --> 23:10.660]  Uh oh.
[23:11.340 --> 23:12.360]  Oh my god!
[23:12.740 --> 23:15.580]  Oh, those doors opened.
[23:15.640 --> 23:16.740]  I didn't know those doors opened!
[23:17.080 --> 23:17.780]  I didn't either.
[23:18.260 --> 23:19.320]  Oh, Nick, get that middle gun.
[23:19.920 --> 23:20.620]  What is that?
[23:23.200 --> 23:24.960]  You need the gun to shoot it.
[23:25.340 --> 23:27.300]  To break the glass, right?
[23:28.560 --> 23:28.940]  Oh.
[23:31.580 --> 23:32.580]  Oh my god!
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.640]  Gavin is 3-0 right now.
[23:37.200 --> 23:38.000]  Is he?
[23:38.380 --> 23:38.540]  Yeah.
[23:38.800 --> 23:40.480]  Are you not?
[23:41.840 --> 23:42.980]  Oh shit!
[23:43.440 --> 23:45.160]  Oh shit.
[23:45.540 --> 23:46.220]  My hat!
[23:48.280 --> 23:48.940]  Oh!
[23:50.320 --> 23:51.910]  What a sniper shot.
[23:52.440 --> 23:54.060]  I keep just seeing cool looking guns
[23:54.060 --> 23:55.500]  and never getting them.
[23:56.220 --> 23:57.220]  Where am I?
[23:57.320 --> 23:57.960]  Oh, there I am.
[23:59.410 --> 24:00.040]  Gotta drop it.
[24:01.120 --> 24:03.240]  Ah, weak. Weak ass.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.380]  Ah!
[24:06.180 --> 24:07.600]  Andrew didn't even have to do anything.
[24:13.940 --> 24:18.540]  God, blunderbuss ass fucking...
[24:18.540 --> 24:19.400]  It is a blunderbuss.
[24:20.860 --> 24:22.140]  Oh god!
[24:22.460 --> 24:23.000]  I wasn't looking!
[24:23.300 --> 24:26.660]  I killed myself, silly dead bastard.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.120]  Ah!
[24:30.120 --> 24:32.840]  I wanted the musket.
[24:33.160 --> 24:34.120]  Oh, what a throw.
[24:34.580 --> 24:35.240]  God damn.
[24:37.180 --> 24:38.380]  How do you play dead?
[24:39.080 --> 24:39.420]  Right bumper.
[24:40.600 --> 24:41.500]  Oh, that's so cool.
[24:42.440 --> 24:42.500]  Oops.
[24:46.000 --> 24:46.300]  Oh, ow.
[24:50.960 --> 24:52.340]  Got him again.
[24:52.820 --> 24:54.160]  I played dead too realistically.
[24:58.040 --> 24:58.600]  Oh!
[24:59.360 --> 25:00.440]  Oh my god!
[25:00.560 --> 25:00.780]  Oops.
[25:01.240 --> 25:02.380]  Didn't see that coming.
[25:02.840 --> 25:03.680]  Oh, bananas!
[25:04.360 --> 25:05.540]  I flew off the side.
[25:06.500 --> 25:07.560]  What happened?
[25:08.260 --> 25:09.300]  You slipped on the banana.
[25:09.920 --> 25:11.320]  But that's for you.
[25:12.400 --> 25:13.540]  Oh, I'm not dead.
[25:13.900 --> 25:14.780]  You're alive.
[25:15.420 --> 25:16.600]  Oh my god, what a shot.
[25:18.180 --> 25:19.500]  Throw it! Run!
[25:23.800 --> 25:24.800]  Oh my god.
[25:24.800 --> 25:25.480]  Did you pick up a buddy?
[25:26.220 --> 25:27.800]  Yeah, I picked up a buddy.
[25:29.060 --> 25:30.760]  Oh, god damn it!
[25:32.780 --> 25:34.000]  Oh my god.
[25:36.860 --> 25:39.520]  Alright, let's see.
[25:40.060 --> 25:45.940]  Oh, come on now.
[25:46.660 --> 25:47.300]  Shit.
[25:55.130 --> 25:56.230]  What are you?
[25:58.470 --> 26:00.250]  What did you think?
[26:01.010 --> 26:01.690]  I was stuck.
[26:03.170 --> 26:04.830]  Andrew, you bastard man.
[26:08.990 --> 26:10.050]  Intermission, intermission.
[26:10.350 --> 26:12.130]  The nightmare chat was like,
[26:12.210 --> 26:14.510]  the display's messed up. And then he went, oh, refreshing fixed it.
[26:14.610 --> 26:15.350]  It's never us.
[26:16.110 --> 26:16.910]  Sometimes it's us.
[26:17.670 --> 26:19.550]  Well, it's not me.
[26:20.270 --> 26:21.390]  It's not Nick.
[26:21.710 --> 26:22.730]  There you go, it's never Nick.
[26:23.870 --> 26:25.750]  Welcome to no Nick November.
[26:26.010 --> 26:26.830]  It's no Nick November.
[26:27.710 --> 26:29.450]  Oh my god, me and Gavin
[26:29.450 --> 26:30.750]  had a pact there.
[26:31.010 --> 26:31.470]  Hey man.
[26:34.530 --> 26:36.270]  Trying to get to my living room.
[26:38.690 --> 26:40.830]  Let my sandwich in the other room.
[26:41.690 --> 26:42.830]  Oh my god.
[26:52.510 --> 26:54.650]  Oh, these guns shoot down, so they shoot at angles.
[26:55.230 --> 26:56.530]  So be very, yeah, like that.
[26:56.830 --> 26:57.470]  Like that?
[26:58.190 --> 26:58.350]  Yeah.
[27:00.230 --> 27:01.510]  Did you get yourself?
[27:02.090 --> 27:02.830]  Yeah, I did.
[27:05.350 --> 27:06.350]  I love the nets.
[27:09.520 --> 27:09.960]  Ah!
[27:10.880 --> 27:11.920]  I blew myself up.
[27:12.140 --> 27:12.740]  I got excited.
[27:12.880 --> 27:13.000]  Ah!
[27:16.320 --> 27:18.780]  He tossed me out like it was trash day.
[27:22.640 --> 27:24.120]  So I threw the pin out.
[27:24.220 --> 27:25.780]  I was like, what did I throw?
[27:26.380 --> 27:26.740]  The pin.
[27:27.660 --> 27:28.820]  The answer was the pin.
[27:29.500 --> 27:30.560]  Yeah, you threw the pin.
[27:32.960 --> 27:33.400]  Ah!
[27:34.000 --> 27:34.440]  Ah!
[27:34.440 --> 27:35.460]  Oh.
[27:35.760 --> 27:36.380]  Oh!
[27:37.680 --> 27:38.580]  That went horribly.
[27:44.060 --> 27:44.680]  No!
[27:47.700 --> 27:48.400]  I'm gonna kill myself!
[27:48.860 --> 27:49.580]  That's what happened to me.
[27:50.020 --> 27:53.600]  I jumped down and grabbed the grenade that I threw.
[27:53.980 --> 27:54.780]  That's what happened to me.
[27:55.420 --> 27:56.540]  Top left, who lives?
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.900]  Did you kill me?
[28:02.900 --> 28:03.900]  You killed me.
[28:04.340 --> 28:05.340]  I killed us both.
[28:06.500 --> 28:09.180]  I couldn't get back up anymore, I just looked the same though.
[28:10.840 --> 28:11.500]  Later, idiot.
[28:13.060 --> 28:15.320]  Watch out for the spikes at the bottom, they will kill you instantly.
[28:16.900 --> 28:17.900]  Did you just net yourself?
[28:18.900 --> 28:19.040]  Ah!
[28:21.180 --> 28:22.040]  Nobody saw that.
[28:22.340 --> 28:22.900]  Throw them on the spikes!
[28:29.480 --> 28:31.800]  I think those shoes let you run on the spikes.
[28:33.460 --> 28:34.920]  Nick's trying to trick you, dude.
[28:35.020 --> 28:36.080]  I wouldn't listen to him.
[28:37.180 --> 28:38.740]  Where do I put this key?
[28:39.700 --> 28:40.800]  Yeah, where does the key go?
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.460]  Oh, I guess it might just be a random spot.
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.300]  Did you just slip on a banana peel and get netted?
[28:48.100 --> 28:48.420]  Shh!
[28:48.900 --> 28:49.880]  Oh my god!
[28:53.160 --> 28:54.200]  Drop the key!
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.120]  You don't need it!
[28:55.220 --> 28:57.260]  The key's good, you want it!
[28:57.900 --> 28:58.820]  No, you'll die!
[28:58.820 --> 29:00.500]  You're alive!
[29:00.500 --> 29:01.720]  He netted himself!
[29:03.140 --> 29:04.420]  Andrew, pick him up!
[29:04.520 --> 29:05.340]  Put him in the spikes!
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.920]  This is the longest duck game in history.
[29:14.440 --> 29:17.160]  You don't have the shoes!
[29:17.760 --> 29:18.820]  I'm such a poover.
[29:25.580 --> 29:26.260]  No!
[29:27.100 --> 29:27.780]  Nick!
[29:29.860 --> 29:31.240]  You gotta grab another one!
[29:33.280 --> 29:35.260]  Oh my god!
[29:35.780 --> 29:36.400]  Andrew!
[29:39.020 --> 29:42.260]  You didn't account for the kickback.
[29:43.740 --> 29:45.860]  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
[29:45.960 --> 29:46.720]  It sure does.
[29:48.120 --> 29:48.400]  Got him.
[29:49.960 --> 29:50.640]  No!
[29:51.320 --> 29:54.420]  Oh my god, I killed you with Nick!
[29:56.840 --> 29:57.360]  No!
[29:57.700 --> 29:59.220]  Oh, you're alive!
[29:59.420 --> 30:00.820]  Oh my god, he's still in it!
[30:01.800 --> 30:03.080]  You killed him!
[30:03.500 --> 30:03.880]  Yes!
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.480]  Oh shit.
[30:18.360 --> 30:19.120]  One sec.
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.780]  Oh, what was that?
[30:20.840 --> 30:22.080]  I'm gonna have to reload again.
[30:22.080 --> 30:22.520]  One sec.
[30:23.600 --> 30:26.080]  Oh fuck, I keep...
[30:39.830 --> 30:41.290]  Oh god, the grenade!
[30:42.670 --> 30:43.150]  What?
[30:45.450 --> 30:46.490]  What even was that?
[30:47.070 --> 30:50.590]  I don't know how I kept living.
[30:50.830 --> 30:53.690]  Oh, the flames heated up the gun and the gun
[30:53.690 --> 30:55.150]  fired through the door to kill Andrew.
[30:55.650 --> 30:56.410]  Oh, that's wild.
[30:56.410 --> 30:57.510]  Oh!
[30:59.190 --> 31:00.370]  Oh my god.
[31:02.450 --> 31:03.410]  What does this do?
[31:03.570 --> 31:05.890]  Hey, you're just wearing my helmet.
[31:06.570 --> 31:08.390]  What are you picking up bodies for?
[31:08.450 --> 31:09.970]  Leave my body alone. What are you doing?
[31:10.470 --> 31:11.450]  You asshole.
[31:11.990 --> 31:12.530]  Oh shit!
[31:14.290 --> 31:21.670]  Oh, I love these.
[31:22.350 --> 31:23.730]  How did I miss?
[31:24.190 --> 31:25.310]  I don't know how you...
[31:25.310 --> 31:26.250]  You suck.
[31:30.610 --> 31:31.830]  Why can't we go in there?
[31:32.870 --> 31:33.150]  Oh!
[31:33.690 --> 31:34.410]  What happened?
[31:35.130 --> 31:37.630]  Oh, you have to go through the middle.
[31:37.810 --> 31:39.870]  No, not the reload. I was trying to jump up
[31:39.870 --> 31:40.770]  and through and you couldn't do it.
[31:41.510 --> 31:44.110]  One person had to reload, the other person threw the gun.
[31:45.410 --> 31:47.390]  It was a real panic moment, wasn't it?
[31:50.330 --> 31:51.050]  Oh shit.
[31:55.670 --> 31:57.310]  You voted to skip that bit?
[31:57.470 --> 31:58.010]  That's amazing.
[31:58.110 --> 31:58.170]  I'm trying.
[31:59.350 --> 32:01.750]  I know I'm not in first, so I'm voting to skip.
[32:02.090 --> 32:02.270]  Ah.
[32:04.750 --> 32:05.230]  Ooh.
[32:05.850 --> 32:06.810]  Oh, I'm in the middle.
[32:10.790 --> 32:11.470]  Oh shit.
[32:11.550 --> 32:12.790]  Oh, that's not good.
[32:16.250 --> 32:17.650]  Not a fair trade.
[32:17.770 --> 32:18.090]  Oh!
[32:18.610 --> 32:19.410]  Not really.
[32:20.750 --> 32:22.010]  What's that glowing thing?
[32:22.010 --> 32:22.410]  Oh!
[32:31.710 --> 32:33.070]  Oh shit!
[32:33.510 --> 32:35.390]  I didn't have to do anything to Nick.
[32:37.570 --> 32:38.250]  Oh.
[32:41.670 --> 32:43.710]  What is that? Just a rifle?
[32:47.890 --> 32:49.250]  What happened?
[32:49.350 --> 32:53.610]  Oh my god.
[32:53.610 --> 32:54.450]  Oh man.
[32:54.650 --> 32:56.850]  Where am I? Oh shit!
[32:57.270 --> 32:59.850]  This is a machine gun. Jesus Christ.
[33:00.250 --> 33:01.130]  Oh shite.
[33:01.810 --> 33:02.450]  Shit butt.
[33:05.610 --> 33:06.650]  Nobody got it.
[33:06.770 --> 33:07.730]  Oh, you got it?
[33:09.690 --> 33:10.610]  Duck wick.
[33:11.330 --> 33:13.270]  Oh, there's traps. Be very careful.
[33:13.570 --> 33:14.150]  What's this piss?
[33:15.770 --> 33:16.710]  Don't listen to him.
[33:17.410 --> 33:18.850]  Where am I? Oh, there I am.
[33:20.930 --> 33:22.350]  I used the trap to my...
[33:22.350 --> 33:23.370]  Ah! Ah! Ah! Fire!
[33:24.690 --> 33:26.390]  Oh, you can put out fire with this, by the way.
[33:27.510 --> 33:28.450]  Oh my god.
[33:28.670 --> 33:29.690]  Andrew, you're gonna burn.
[33:31.650 --> 33:32.090]  Yeah.
[33:33.990 --> 33:34.430]  Oh!
[33:35.670 --> 33:36.950]  Not in my own fire!
[33:37.710 --> 33:39.150]  Not in my own fire!
[33:39.470 --> 33:40.550]  Hug me! Hug me!
[33:40.730 --> 33:41.490]  Oh no!
[33:41.890 --> 33:43.110]  Don't you touch me!
[33:44.510 --> 33:44.930]  Uh oh.
[33:45.810 --> 33:46.810]  That didn't work?
[33:46.810 --> 33:48.490]  Oh, come on!
[33:50.150 --> 33:51.030]  Why didn't that go?
[33:51.990 --> 33:53.410]  It's a short range weapon.
[33:53.590 --> 33:54.550]  Bloody short.
[33:57.530 --> 33:58.050]  Yeah!
[33:58.850 --> 34:00.230]  I pulled the pin.
[34:05.170 --> 34:06.770]  I keep thinking I'm the captain.
[34:10.210 --> 34:11.110]  What happened?
[34:11.530 --> 34:13.990]  I threw a grenade at the wall to bounce back and got me.
[34:17.490 --> 34:18.470]  Oh, I just...
[34:18.470 --> 34:20.190]  I didn't fucking jump. I just walked.
[34:20.650 --> 34:22.630]  I didn't have to do anything. I just gave it to Gavin.
[34:23.410 --> 34:23.790]  Oh.
[34:24.690 --> 34:26.070]  Yeah, no problem, man. I got you.
[34:26.390 --> 34:26.830]  Oh.
[34:28.550 --> 34:29.390]  Oh my god.
[34:30.990 --> 34:32.390]  Oh shit! Oh, Gavin.
[34:32.990 --> 34:33.430]  Gavin.
[34:35.530 --> 34:36.950]  Take my box home.
[34:39.150 --> 34:40.690]  PCGamer2020, thanks for the Prime sub.
[34:41.150 --> 34:41.850]  Yeah, thank you.
[34:42.950 --> 34:44.910]  Whoa! Holy shit soup.
[34:46.890 --> 34:47.370]  Ow!
[34:50.710 --> 34:52.330]  Oh balls. Oh balls.
[34:54.750 --> 34:56.570]  In the fire. What?
[34:57.290 --> 34:58.770]  Gavin playing GTA.
[34:59.870 --> 35:00.590]  And he won!
[35:00.770 --> 35:01.130]  Damn it.
[35:02.310 --> 35:03.890]  Oh, watch out for the spikes.
[35:06.590 --> 35:07.730]  Oh, damn it.
[35:07.930 --> 35:10.690]  I saw you throw the grenade, but I thought I had more time.
[35:10.850 --> 35:11.190]  Damn it.
[35:11.530 --> 35:13.830]  I thought it was going into the open door.
[35:13.830 --> 35:14.490]  Oh.
[35:15.110 --> 35:16.650]  How did you avoid them?
[35:16.990 --> 35:18.310]  How did you avoid them?
[35:22.230 --> 35:23.710]  Uh oh, Gavin, you better move.
[35:23.910 --> 35:25.050]  Game time. There you go.
[35:26.870 --> 35:27.890]  Cardiac arrest.
[35:30.850 --> 35:31.530]  Oh!
[35:33.730 --> 35:34.710]  My hat!
[35:39.340 --> 35:40.020]  Andrew.
[35:40.380 --> 35:40.880]  Yeah!
[35:40.880 --> 35:41.260]  Yeah!
[35:41.700 --> 35:42.700]  Nobody gets it.
[35:44.860 --> 35:45.600]  Nope.
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.820]  What does this do?
[35:52.160 --> 35:52.600]  Toss it.
[35:54.500 --> 35:55.980]  Uh oh.
[35:58.900 --> 35:59.520]  Oh shit!
[35:59.700 --> 36:00.200]  Things are blowing up!
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.600]  What is happening?
[36:05.540 --> 36:06.600]  You're on fire.
[36:07.560 --> 36:08.960]  Oh my god!
[36:08.960 --> 36:09.840]  Oh my god!
[36:10.760 --> 36:11.840]  Oh boy.
[36:12.960 --> 36:14.120]  Oh, you have a trumpet.
[36:15.180 --> 36:16.680]  Hang on, hang on.
[36:17.040 --> 36:18.100]  I'm busy!
[36:21.360 --> 36:21.860]  I don't want that.
[36:22.160 --> 36:22.440]  Dunk!
[36:24.280 --> 36:26.340]  This is the best game ever made.
[36:27.200 --> 36:27.380]  Oh!
[36:28.740 --> 36:29.060]  Oh!
[36:29.780 --> 36:31.180]  What the fuck?
[36:31.180 --> 36:33.220]  What the fuck?
[36:36.400 --> 36:38.300]  Let's play this every week.
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.720]  God damn the dart gun.
[36:41.880 --> 36:43.640]  I just kept getting the dart gun.
[36:44.140 --> 36:45.140]  Oh wow.
[36:45.640 --> 36:46.780]  How do you shoot up?
[36:47.680 --> 36:48.680]  You have to be floating.
[36:49.460 --> 36:50.260]  Floating down.
[36:52.920 --> 36:53.880]  Oh my god, that was fun.
[36:58.600 --> 36:59.140]  Nice!
[37:08.100 --> 37:09.060]  Alright, so...
[37:09.060 --> 37:09.420]  I win.
[37:10.700 --> 37:12.660]  Do we want to try...
[37:13.320 --> 37:16.040]  Look at all of my fans in the audience.
[37:16.260 --> 37:16.640]  Go again!
[37:18.840 --> 37:19.320]  Yay!
[37:21.120 --> 37:21.900]  Alright, let's do it.
[37:22.620 --> 37:23.220]  Keep going!
[37:23.960 --> 37:25.620]  Alright, continue. Here we go.
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.780]  Oh, we gotta slide into it. Like that.
[37:30.760 --> 37:31.320]  Like that.
[37:32.260 --> 37:32.740]  Sausage.
[37:32.740 --> 37:32.820]  Sausage.
[37:35.340 --> 37:37.980]  Oh my god, Nick!
[37:38.960 --> 37:39.800]  He's juggling.
[37:48.500 --> 37:49.440]  Shit.
[37:52.550 --> 37:54.750]  Oh, I tried to jump it. Damn it.
[37:58.700 --> 37:59.640]  Yeah!
[38:06.840 --> 38:08.220]  Oh, what's the TV do?
[38:08.300 --> 38:10.360]  Oh, apparently holding the TV makes you run faster.
[38:10.680 --> 38:11.260]  Damn it.
[38:12.600 --> 38:14.160]  Could not run the bullets.
[38:16.940 --> 38:18.020]  What is that?
[38:19.060 --> 38:20.960]  You can charge that, by the way.
[38:21.140 --> 38:22.020]  Like a plasma pistol.
[38:22.440 --> 38:22.920]  Okay.
[38:24.040 --> 38:24.440]  Oh shit.
[38:31.740 --> 38:32.220]  Highlander.
[38:33.060 --> 38:35.180]  There can only be one!
[38:39.220 --> 38:40.700]  God damn it.
[38:40.780 --> 38:42.140]  I just figured out who I was.
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.000]  Oh my god!
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.020]  I was reloading my musket.
[38:54.610 --> 38:55.970]  Oh shit.
[38:57.470 --> 38:58.130]  Blocked him.
[38:58.430 --> 38:59.270]  I blocked the door.
[39:00.290 --> 39:01.650]  Oh, Eric.
[39:01.650 --> 39:01.710]  Oh, Eric.
[39:04.350 --> 39:05.570]  Wield me as a weapon.
[39:13.030 --> 39:14.150]  Oh shit.
[39:19.370 --> 39:21.550]  Oh, he blunderbussed me.
[39:21.810 --> 39:23.030]  Yes, he didn't get it.
[39:23.330 --> 39:24.410]  No, I think I got it still.
[39:27.310 --> 39:28.990]  Oh no. Bye.
[39:29.830 --> 39:30.590]  Oh my god.
[39:31.290 --> 39:33.550]  The door was stuck. There was furniture on the other side.
[39:33.810 --> 39:34.230]  Oh!
[39:34.490 --> 39:35.730]  What a shot!
[39:41.570 --> 39:43.410]  Oh, what's the duct tape do?
[39:45.010 --> 39:45.890]  Oh, it does nothing.
[39:46.730 --> 39:49.310]  Maybe you can throw it at someone and it duct tapes them.
[39:50.010 --> 39:50.850]  Oh, Andrew.
[39:54.130 --> 39:55.070]  Oh, it's a grenade launcher.
[39:59.650 --> 40:00.390]  Oh!
[40:04.230 --> 40:06.490]  How did I get netted?
[40:07.190 --> 40:08.130]  Oh no!
[40:08.410 --> 40:10.030]  Wow, you ducked in the net.
[40:14.170 --> 40:15.050]  Oh my god.
[40:16.630 --> 40:18.090]  Oh no.
[40:19.250 --> 40:20.150]  Damn it.
[40:24.580 --> 40:26.220]  Be respectful of my body.
[40:26.220 --> 40:27.180]  Oh!
[40:29.300 --> 40:29.860]  Shield.
[40:30.420 --> 40:30.760]  Duck!
[40:33.360 --> 40:33.920]  Oh.
[40:36.540 --> 40:38.800]  Alright, so you can charge this to shoot through doors.
[40:39.080 --> 40:40.180]  The plasma pistol.
[40:40.260 --> 40:40.620]  Like this.
[40:44.710 --> 40:45.270]  What?
[40:48.670 --> 40:49.430]  What happened?
[40:50.310 --> 40:51.090]  You shot me.
[40:51.570 --> 40:51.890]  Oh, right.
[40:53.950 --> 40:54.350]  Oh!
[40:55.190 --> 40:55.970]  Wait a minute.
[41:02.070 --> 41:10.170]  Well, I picked up two good ones there at the end,
[41:10.230 --> 41:11.350]  but boy, I'm going to be in last.
[41:15.870 --> 41:16.810]  There we go!
[41:18.550 --> 41:20.250]  We know who's in first.
[41:20.570 --> 41:21.930]  Oh, traps galore.
[41:21.930 --> 41:22.410]  Careful.
[41:22.810 --> 41:26.150]  How do I...?
[41:26.150 --> 41:26.830]  Wow.
[41:27.210 --> 41:28.210]  Yeah, that was quick.
[41:29.550 --> 41:30.910]  Oh my god.
[41:31.650 --> 41:33.370]  No need for traps.
[41:37.530 --> 41:38.330]  Oh.
[41:39.610 --> 41:40.410]  Bastard.
[41:40.630 --> 41:40.990]  Oh shit.
[41:48.920 --> 41:50.940]  Someone's hiding up there.
[41:53.740 --> 41:55.220]  Oh, he's out!
[41:58.120 --> 41:59.520]  I forgot about a gun!
[42:01.140 --> 42:04.020]  I think the ketchup's a good effect.
[42:09.220 --> 42:11.000]  Oh my god!
[42:11.220 --> 42:12.900]  What were you holding that exploded?
[42:15.100 --> 42:17.340]  There's a huge gun in that key room.
[42:17.580 --> 42:20.260]  No need, Andrew's got this.
[42:24.260 --> 42:25.580]  So nasty.
[42:30.120 --> 42:30.900]  Oh!
[42:31.240 --> 42:32.020]  Oh!
[42:32.400 --> 42:32.740]  Oh!
[42:35.600 --> 42:36.740]  Oh yes!
[42:37.340 --> 42:38.560]  A box killed me?
[42:40.860 --> 42:43.460]  That was like throwing the grenade back
[42:43.460 --> 42:44.040]  to kill a Jew.
[42:44.900 --> 42:45.680]  Oh!
[42:46.460 --> 42:49.780]  Oh Jesus Christ!
[42:51.820 --> 42:53.580]  Oh my god!
[42:56.520 --> 42:58.340]  Oh, that was so close.
[42:58.340 --> 42:58.920]  Uh oh.
[42:59.080 --> 42:59.480]  Yes!
[43:00.320 --> 43:00.800]  Wait.
[43:03.080 --> 43:03.560]  What?
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.060]  How did I die?
[43:07.160 --> 43:07.680]  Oh, that was terrible.
[43:15.140 --> 43:16.100]  Oh shit.
[43:16.880 --> 43:17.620]  Oh my god!
[43:17.960 --> 43:19.000]  Took his head off.
[43:21.040 --> 43:22.300]  Shot my helmet off.
[43:22.360 --> 43:22.640]  Yep.
[43:23.520 --> 43:24.840]  Better go get another one, dude.
[43:26.300 --> 43:27.100]  Oh, I threw it!
[43:27.120 --> 43:28.780]  Wrong button!
[43:28.780 --> 43:29.940]  Grab the Spartan laser!
[43:31.560 --> 43:33.760]  Uh oh.
[43:34.420 --> 43:35.380]  Oh.
[43:35.820 --> 43:36.500]  Oh!
[43:41.560 --> 43:48.580]  Eric, you're out.
[43:51.320 --> 43:54.500]  If you shot two shots, you're out.
[44:04.280 --> 44:05.280]  Pull the trigger.
[44:08.360 --> 44:08.820]  No!
[44:13.340 --> 44:15.060]  Oh, what the freaking hell was that?
[44:15.060 --> 44:15.740]  Oh, what the fuck?
[44:16.080 --> 44:17.280]  Oh, damn it to hell.
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.460]  Andrew's cleaning up this round.
[44:19.580 --> 44:21.000]  We gotta stop that maniac.
[44:21.260 --> 44:23.680]  I got one or two.
[44:23.720 --> 44:24.400]  Oh, come on!
[44:24.900 --> 44:25.680]  One or two.
[44:26.960 --> 44:28.360]  Don't worry about me.
[44:30.560 --> 44:30.740]  Oh!
[44:30.920 --> 44:31.060]  Oh!
[44:31.060 --> 44:31.120]  Oh!
[44:33.960 --> 44:34.520]  No!
[44:37.340 --> 44:38.800]  I don't have a license for this!
[44:39.280 --> 44:40.440]  Shot out of his shoes.
[44:43.440 --> 44:44.000]  Oops.
[44:44.620 --> 44:45.340]  What the?
[44:46.020 --> 44:46.200]  Oh!
[44:47.080 --> 44:47.640]  Oh!
[44:47.880 --> 44:48.340]  Oh!
[44:48.540 --> 44:48.760]  Oh!
[44:54.180 --> 44:56.620]  It was such a stupid...
[44:56.620 --> 44:58.180]  What the fuck just happened there?
[44:59.540 --> 45:03.900]  I had all that armor on,
[45:03.900 --> 45:05.200]  and it didn't do anything for me.
[45:05.400 --> 45:07.680]  Well, that shotgun's the most powerful shotgun.
[45:08.660 --> 45:09.140]  Ah!
[45:10.240 --> 45:10.720]  Yes!
[45:10.860 --> 45:12.340]  Didn't even have to do anything.
[45:13.360 --> 45:14.720]  I took some health myself.
[45:17.880 --> 45:18.360]  No!
[45:23.660 --> 45:25.140]  Uh oh. Conversion.
[45:27.020 --> 45:27.920]  What the hell?
[45:28.300 --> 45:29.340]  My buttons are all backwards.
[45:29.460 --> 45:29.920]  What happened?
[45:30.820 --> 45:31.860]  You're one of me.
[45:31.920 --> 45:32.860]  Who was the real Nick?
[45:32.860 --> 45:34.220]  I don't know, I guess.
[45:34.620 --> 45:34.720]  Wait.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.460]  I survived. I stayed on top.
[45:40.640 --> 45:42.020]  Yeah, we know where it stands.
[45:42.360 --> 45:42.840]  Okay.
[45:43.640 --> 45:44.980]  6-6-4-3.
[45:47.180 --> 45:48.100]  Oh, here we go.
[45:48.240 --> 45:48.520]  Ah!
[45:50.700 --> 45:51.180]  Ah!
[45:55.280 --> 45:56.080]  Oh my god!
[45:56.960 --> 45:58.880]  What happened? Where'd my gun go?
[45:59.140 --> 46:00.980]  He shot it out of my hand.
[46:01.220 --> 46:02.240]  Oh my god.
[46:02.240 --> 46:03.920]  I don't know how he did that.
[46:04.660 --> 46:05.840]  That was awesome.
[46:10.130 --> 46:10.930]  Oh no!
[46:11.430 --> 46:13.770]  You bastard man.
[46:15.010 --> 46:16.630]  You locked me in a room with a grenade.
[46:22.070 --> 46:23.170]  Oh, I'm alive.
[46:23.370 --> 46:24.130]  I can't believe I'm alive.
[46:24.130 --> 46:25.310]  I can't believe you're alive either.
[46:30.390 --> 46:31.710]  Oh, come on!
[46:31.710 --> 46:32.670]  I had him.
[46:34.230 --> 46:35.310]  This is chaos.
[46:37.790 --> 46:38.830]  Where am I?
[46:39.110 --> 46:39.810]  Oh, I'm in piss.
[46:41.230 --> 46:42.330]  Careful, it lights up.
[46:42.490 --> 46:42.910]  Oh shit.
[46:45.250 --> 46:46.270]  That might be a grenade.
[46:47.250 --> 46:48.810]  Oh, I got sucked through that tube.
[46:50.430 --> 46:51.610]  Get in the water!
[46:51.750 --> 46:52.170]  Get in the water!
[46:52.670 --> 46:53.350]  Get in the water!
[46:54.890 --> 46:55.930]  Put me out.
[46:56.270 --> 46:58.170]  Did I shoot the trap to kill someone?
[46:58.170 --> 46:59.370]  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:59.410 --> 47:01.590]  Band time!
[47:07.750 --> 47:09.470]  I'm a creep!
[47:12.330 --> 47:13.690]  I'm the singer.
[47:15.630 --> 47:17.690]  I'm Kurt Cobain, but the other way.
[47:20.670 --> 47:22.090]  I did a reverse Cobain.
[47:23.350 --> 47:24.390]  Jesus Christ.
[47:24.390 --> 47:24.630]  Oh, my gun!
[47:27.390 --> 47:28.870]  Oh, it's a one and done.
[47:32.810 --> 47:33.490]  Ah!
[47:36.710 --> 47:37.530]  Fuck off!
[47:37.750 --> 47:38.250]  Oh, damn.
[47:48.360 --> 47:49.560]  What's your move?
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.860]  That's why mom says don't play with knives.
[47:58.240 --> 47:59.540]  What is this?
[48:00.900 --> 48:01.480]  Oh, bananas.
[48:02.480 --> 48:03.080]  Ah!
[48:13.570 --> 48:15.610]  Jump on his head, jump on his head, jump on his head, jump on his head.
[48:15.910 --> 48:17.390]  Oh, you both jump on each other's heads.
[48:18.450 --> 48:19.530]  Oh, because you have the shoes?
[48:20.130 --> 48:20.290]  Yeah.
[48:21.330 --> 48:22.350]  Oh, my God.
[48:24.050 --> 48:25.110]  I don't even know what happened.
[48:25.810 --> 48:27.010]  You slipped on a banana peel.
[48:28.910 --> 48:29.470]  And died.
[48:48.600 --> 48:49.520]  Just lying down,
[48:49.520 --> 48:50.500]  gauzing out blood.
[48:53.620 --> 48:54.500]  Oh, no!
[48:58.820 --> 48:59.260]  Grenade!
[49:00.600 --> 49:01.320]  Don't do that!
[49:10.670 --> 49:12.370]  You were hidden behind my corpse.
[49:13.010 --> 49:13.490]  Oh, shit!
[49:17.130 --> 49:17.570]  Wee!
[49:18.730 --> 49:19.850]  Wow, that was a fast round.
[49:20.010 --> 49:20.870]  Yeah, I think that might be it.
[49:21.770 --> 49:22.810]  I don't think so.
[49:23.470 --> 49:24.170]  It is.
[49:24.290 --> 49:25.210]  Oh, it was.
[49:28.470 --> 49:29.430]  Of course!
[49:32.350 --> 49:33.390]  Alright, let's do it again.
[49:33.790 --> 49:34.030]  More!
[49:35.790 --> 49:37.330]  I told you, it's fun, right?
[49:40.130 --> 49:41.330]  Yeah, real fun.
[49:44.010 --> 49:45.130]  I like that one.
[49:47.290 --> 49:47.730]  Oh!
[49:49.410 --> 49:52.490]  Oh, shit!
[49:52.570 --> 49:53.710]  Oh, me and Gavin had a match.
[49:55.950 --> 49:57.370]  Did you pull the pin out of a grenade?
[49:57.370 --> 49:57.610]  Yep.
[50:06.710 --> 50:07.770]  Fine with me.
[50:07.790 --> 50:07.810]  Ah!
[50:08.530 --> 50:09.650]  Oh, my God!
[50:11.690 --> 50:12.130]  No!
[50:12.690 --> 50:14.510]  Oh, Nick just panicked.
[50:14.590 --> 50:15.070]  Oh, shit!
[50:17.390 --> 50:17.830]  Oh!
[50:17.830 --> 50:19.170]  Oh, what a throw!
[50:21.950 --> 50:23.910]  Cooked to perfection, medium rare.
[50:26.490 --> 50:27.970]  Oh, God damn it!
[50:29.410 --> 50:31.250]  I need to memorize the game.
[50:32.550 --> 50:34.210]  I killed myself, apparently.
[50:36.370 --> 50:36.850]  Ooh!
[50:38.550 --> 50:40.790]  And hold A to use your boosties.
[50:40.990 --> 50:41.690]  They go away, though.
[50:42.830 --> 50:43.290]  Ah!
[50:44.150 --> 50:46.790]  I tried to turn on my boosties in the net.
[50:46.790 --> 50:48.250]  Oh, shit!
[50:48.470 --> 50:49.090]  Whoa!
[50:49.630 --> 50:53.190]  You can boost while you're netted.
[50:54.470 --> 50:56.690]  And I think it's gonna be
[50:56.690 --> 50:58.350]  a long, long time.
[50:58.790 --> 50:59.310]  Get the hammer!
[51:01.730 --> 51:02.650]  Touchdown.
[51:03.670 --> 51:07.010]  Oh, no!
[51:08.510 --> 51:09.870]  Oh, my God.
[51:12.510 --> 51:13.590]  Uh-oh.
[51:15.910 --> 51:16.390]  Ah!
[51:17.770 --> 51:19.430]  I thought I was safe!
[51:23.210 --> 51:24.970]  So I get what the dart gun's for now.
[51:25.950 --> 51:26.630]  Oh, yeah.
[51:28.350 --> 51:29.210]  Oh, God!
[51:32.090 --> 51:33.770]  There's Moon and Night weapons in this level.
[51:34.030 --> 51:34.850]  I almost died there.
[51:43.430 --> 51:46.150]  All right, is this the...
[51:47.290 --> 51:47.770]  Ah!
[51:51.530 --> 51:52.390]  I'm netted!
[51:53.230 --> 51:54.470]  Oh, you're both netted.
[51:56.610 --> 51:57.570]  What is that?
[51:57.830 --> 51:58.590]  How do you get that?
[52:04.470 --> 52:05.630]  I'll see you later.
[52:06.850 --> 52:08.090]  Oh, you got the win!
[52:08.150 --> 52:09.670]  Oh, he got it just in time.
[52:09.790 --> 52:10.630]  What a win!
[52:13.680 --> 52:13.960]  Ah!
[52:17.140 --> 52:17.780]  Oh, God!
[52:19.860 --> 52:21.420]  Oh, no! Why did I die?
[52:21.540 --> 52:22.320]  Oh, come on.
[52:25.800 --> 52:26.780]  Oh, crashed again.
[52:29.800 --> 52:31.260]  All right, should we go back to the lobby?
[52:31.440 --> 52:31.700]  Yeah.
[52:34.580 --> 52:35.580]  No, no, no, no.
[52:35.740 --> 52:37.560]  We're playing all the way to the end, man.
[52:37.600 --> 52:38.480]  We gotta get you in here.
[52:39.660 --> 52:41.080]  There's so much happening right now
[52:41.080 --> 52:43.120]  where just shit is just flying on my screen.
[52:44.640 --> 52:45.080]  I got a
[52:45.080 --> 52:47.020]  Corpetron. Yeah, just start hitting
[52:47.020 --> 52:48.100]  buttons. It takes you through it.
[52:48.740 --> 52:51.100]  Oh, my God. Let me get the gift that you're giving
[52:51.100 --> 52:52.080]  me and get out of this.
[52:53.920 --> 52:54.460]  I'm ready.
[52:55.780 --> 52:56.620]  I'm almost there.
[52:56.920 --> 52:58.900]  Hold on. It's making me look at all this.
[53:01.780 --> 53:03.120]  Oh, okay. I can leave. There we go.
[53:03.900 --> 53:04.180]  All right.
[53:06.120 --> 53:06.480]  Huh.
[53:06.940 --> 53:08.660]  I got a steam achievement.
[53:08.660 --> 53:09.580]  Oh, my God, Nick.
[53:11.440 --> 53:12.660]  I don't want it.
[53:13.320 --> 53:14.160]  All right, let's see.
[53:14.900 --> 53:16.660]  Invite. I think I'll be comfortable
[53:16.660 --> 53:18.480]  to sleep in an anti-gravity tube.
[53:19.180 --> 53:19.660]  Oh, yeah.
[53:20.660 --> 53:22.480]  It'd probably be good for your back, right?
[53:23.880 --> 53:24.600]  Yeah, would it be
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.780]  good or bad for you? I don't know.
[53:26.780 --> 53:27.700]  I don't know.
[53:29.960 --> 53:30.360]  Huh.
[53:33.590 --> 53:34.490]  Let's do it, Andrew.
[53:34.830 --> 53:35.950]  I'm on my way.
[53:38.850 --> 53:39.810]  Oh, resume.
[53:39.990 --> 53:40.310]  Nice.
[53:42.910 --> 53:43.930]  That's a new feature.
[53:44.150 --> 53:44.630]  Hell yeah.
[53:45.150 --> 53:46.250]  That's a new feature.
[53:46.670 --> 53:47.730]  Like nothing happened.
[53:50.870 --> 53:51.030]  Shit.
[53:51.570 --> 53:51.770]  Shit.
[53:53.290 --> 53:56.170]  Hey, I'm ready
[53:56.170 --> 53:57.030]  for the fight, guys.
[53:59.050 --> 54:00.170]  It takes us to this.
[54:00.170 --> 54:01.870]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[54:03.990 --> 54:04.430]  Uh.
[54:05.330 --> 54:06.770]  3, 3, 2, 1. Oh.
[54:08.550 --> 54:10.110]  Guys, we're getting close to 501.
[54:15.960 --> 54:17.360]  How are you doing so fast?
[54:17.360 --> 54:19.120]  Oh, good shot, Eric. Thanks, buddy.
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.620]  Hey, what the fuck?
[54:21.820 --> 54:23.540]  That went through the floor. That was cheating.
[54:24.040 --> 54:24.500]  Crispy duck.
[54:25.140 --> 54:27.120]  Yeah, I won with the force.
[54:30.800 --> 54:31.500]  Oh, no.
[54:31.500 --> 54:31.520]  Oh.
[54:36.080 --> 54:36.480]  Oh.
[54:37.280 --> 54:38.420]  I didn't time it right.
[54:39.220 --> 54:41.820]  I missed. I missed. It was such a good play.
[54:42.480 --> 54:43.280]  Oh, man.
[54:45.880 --> 54:47.600]  The grassy knoll. The grassy knoll.
[54:52.280 --> 54:52.560]  Oh.
[54:53.840 --> 54:54.240]  Oh.
[54:57.160 --> 54:57.960]  Oh, shit.
[54:58.120 --> 54:58.940]  What a shot.
[54:59.140 --> 55:02.020]  I don't know how that gun works exactly. I just keep hitting X.
[55:02.220 --> 55:03.840]  I didn't think you could reload it until I was
[55:03.840 --> 55:05.160]  halfway into that round.
[55:05.380 --> 55:05.740]  Oh.
[55:07.540 --> 55:09.020]  Oh, my God.
[55:11.280 --> 55:13.500]  Grab the gun. Grab the machine gun. Grab the machine gun.
[55:16.440 --> 55:18.000]  Didn't even need it. Let the smoke clear.
[55:21.680 --> 55:22.480]  Oh, what's...
[55:22.480 --> 55:22.640]  Oh.
[55:23.560 --> 55:24.120]  That's for you.
[55:24.940 --> 55:26.600]  No. No.
[55:27.160 --> 55:27.460]  No.
[55:27.460 --> 55:27.640]  Oh.
[55:33.080 --> 55:33.840]  Drown him.
[55:33.920 --> 55:45.890]  What a net.
[55:48.390 --> 55:48.690]  God.
[55:51.410 --> 55:53.270]  The other way.
[55:59.400 --> 56:00.420]  He's evading.
[56:02.400 --> 56:04.000]  Oh, the tables have turned.
[56:04.480 --> 56:06.100]  Oh, my God. Can he finish him?
[56:07.280 --> 56:07.680]  No.
[56:09.880 --> 56:10.300]  Yes.
[56:11.400 --> 56:12.320]  I don't want it.
[56:12.680 --> 56:13.600]  Oh, my God.
[56:15.100 --> 56:19.440]  Oh, freaking hell.
[56:25.600 --> 56:27.900]  I think that banana skin saved you.
[56:31.840 --> 56:33.880]  That TV looks like it's from Sonic.
[56:34.400 --> 56:35.540]  It does.
[56:36.260 --> 56:37.100]  Sanic.
[56:38.640 --> 56:39.240]  Sanic.
[56:50.980 --> 56:53.480]  Oh, that was close.
[56:58.830 --> 57:01.270]  Oh, my God.
[57:03.230 --> 57:03.930]  Was that Noah?
[57:04.530 --> 57:05.730]  458.
[57:06.510 --> 57:07.430]  That was Noah.
[57:12.890 --> 57:14.110]  Freaking hell.
[57:17.970 --> 57:20.530]  Oh, you didn't trip? That's bullshit.
[57:23.650 --> 57:24.450]  Oh, Andrew.
[57:26.830 --> 57:29.030]  Just clubbed in the head.
[57:31.530 --> 57:32.130]  Oh.
[57:35.310 --> 57:35.550]  Oh.
[57:38.250 --> 57:38.490]  Oh.
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.140]  I want it. I want it. I want it. Oh, shit.
[57:49.540 --> 57:49.780]  No.
[57:52.040 --> 57:53.300]  Throw him with the spikes. Throw him with the spikes.
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.060]  Well,
[58:08.090 --> 58:09.260]  that's a single shot.
[58:12.440 --> 58:13.860]  He's alive.
[58:16.200 --> 58:17.100]  Single shot.
[58:17.660 --> 58:17.920]  Shit.
[58:20.520 --> 58:22.220]  Got him.
[58:22.280 --> 58:23.640]  Damn it.
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.580]  That was so brutal.
[58:29.350 --> 58:29.780]  No.
[58:36.880 --> 58:37.060]  No.
[58:37.740 --> 58:39.240]  Oh, Jesus.
[58:41.200 --> 58:43.160]  Burn for it.
[58:43.520 --> 58:43.820]  No.
[58:49.320 --> 58:50.440]  459, guys.
[58:50.480 --> 58:52.000]  We're getting on a 501.
[58:54.040 --> 58:55.660]  We're getting so close.
[58:55.660 --> 58:57.680]  While me and Gavin are in the lead
[58:57.680 --> 58:59.120]  and Nick sucks.
[58:59.520 --> 59:00.660]  Two-minute warning.
[59:01.440 --> 59:01.920]  That's it.
[59:02.840 --> 59:04.040]  Nick's about to step it up now.
[59:05.400 --> 59:06.200]  Content over.
[59:12.640 --> 59:13.280]  Gavin.
[59:14.940 --> 59:16.520]  What a surefire shot.
[59:21.700 --> 59:22.980]  Oh, man.
[59:23.040 --> 59:23.740]  I want a gun.
[59:23.740 --> 59:24.000]  I want a gun.
[59:26.960 --> 59:28.240]  Nick has a rock.
[59:31.840 --> 59:32.480]  Shit.
[59:32.740 --> 59:34.460]  We're 30 seconds away.
[59:35.100 --> 59:37.300]  30 seconds away from 501.
[59:38.580 --> 59:40.340]  Get your 501 emotes ready.
[59:42.020 --> 59:43.780]  Oh, my God.
[59:45.080 --> 59:47.500]  Oh, what a shot.
[59:49.120 --> 59:51.200]  Get your 501 emotes ready, guys.
[59:51.340 --> 59:52.920]  It is time for the best time
[59:52.920 --> 59:54.220]  of the week.
[59:56.040 --> 59:57.270]  Oh, shit.
[59:58.160 --> 59:59.220]  Oh, balls.
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.540]  What is that?
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:01.860]  It's a...
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.780]  What?
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.380]  It's a backwards gun?
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:08.960]  501.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.240]  It's a teleporting backwards gun?
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.500]  501, look at that.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.140]  Holy shit.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:15.860]  501.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.220]  Don't.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.320]  Shit, shit, shit.
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.720]  Oh, my God. I got blown away.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.440]  Guys, it's 501.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.120]  Thanks for joining us every Friday.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.240]  This is the way we do it. We're taking it all the way to the end of this duck game.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.500]  This was part of
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.640]  No Nick November.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.360]  No Nick.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.180]  Big choice for Nick. The game he's really, really good at.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:48.400]  What?
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.240]  I mean, yeah.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.080]  What?
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.600]  I just fell in the spikes.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.460]  It's fun though, right?
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.320]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, nobody said it wasn't fun.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.960]  Nobody said it wasn't fun, Nick.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.100]  We just said that...
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.480]  Way to go, Gavin.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:04.640]  Thank you.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.760]  It's 901 here in Australia.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.700]  Yeah, different times in different places.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.060]  Oh.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.260]  Oh.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.140]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.580]  He's right there.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.780]  No, no, no.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.640]  You made me get rid of my gun.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.400]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.160]  I'll make you pay.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.080]  Oh, this is bad.
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.560]  What is this?
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.100]  What is that?
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.640]  Oh, God.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.500]  Oh, help.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:41.360]  No.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.360]  I didn't even do anything. I'm just hanging out.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.940]  Oh, I shot you.
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:48.440]  Yeah, a gun blew a door off and killed you.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.840]  Come on.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.280]  Oh, Michael.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.520]  Oh, no.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:56.900]  Cooked.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.520]  Okay.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.260]  Holy shit.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:07.960]  Wow.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.760]  That was sick.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.160]  That was really awesome.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]  Here we go.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.880]  Oh.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.960]  Oh.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.540]  I knew it was spikes, and I tried to avoid it.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.200]  Couldn't do it.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.920]  Oh.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.640]  What are you thinking?
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.380]  Door closed, huh?
[01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:33.270]  Oh, it's a gun.
[01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:35.070]  Ah.
[01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:37.910]  You at the shoes?
[01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.330]  My shoes stomped your head.
[01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:41.270]  God damn it.
[01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.750]  This is going to be really close between three people.
[01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.030]  Did we get it?
[01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.390]  Oh, he's close.
[01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.530]  I want to see this.
[01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:51.010]  Okay.
[01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:52.270]  Oh.
[01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:53.490]  Oh.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.210]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:00.310]  Two.
[01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:05.850]  Mostly.
[01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:09.230]  Ow.
[01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.610]  Oh, that's what the key's for?
[01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:14.610]  I suck shit.
[01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.870]  Shit ass sucker.
[01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:17.590]  No, no, no, no.
[01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:20.830]  Oh, no.
[01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:23.850]  I almost did, yeah.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.060]  No.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.980]  I have to get the water.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.700]  I have to get the water.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.920]  Oh, my God. It's raining hell.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:40.080]  Wow.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.160]  This is nuts.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.020]  Are you using a body
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.820]  as a weapon?
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.000]  He's using Gavin with me.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.840]  No, Gavin's mine.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:53.980]  No, that's Andrew.
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:55.800]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.180]  Someone help me.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.600]  Oh.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.400]  Don't do it.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.320]  Just let it go.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.440]  Three.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.100]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:17.160]  Oh, God.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.480]  Oh, no.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.960]  You can hit down A there, Eric.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.700]  Thank you.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.240]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:35.060]  Uh-oh.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.560]  What?
[01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:47.730]  Oh, my God.
[01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:53.810]  I think you each have nine.
[01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:57.390]  Uh-oh.
[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:02.030]  You got me dead to rights, Andrew.
[01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:04.670]  Do it, Andrew. Take it home.
[01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:06.030]  He's only got a net.
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:07.130]  Four.
[01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.870]  What if we have to do another round?
[01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:16.370]  Oops.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:23.110]  God bless.
[01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:26.930]  Someone's playing, like, SOS
[01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:27.850]  or something that's going on.
[01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.110]  I think you can change the...
[01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.170]  Oh!
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:34.830]  I was busy playing a song. You guys suck.
[01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:38.750]  Uh-oh.
[01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.850]  Nick got too excited.
[01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.650]  I did. All right, Andrew, it's up to you.
[01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:48.350]  You got to kill Gavin.
[01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.370]  Nice job.
[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:51.850]  You got him?
[01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.870]  You're out of ammo, Gavin.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.120]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.740]  Yeah, no hesitation.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.540]  Oh, that's a wall.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.180]  Wow!
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.960]  I had a whole plan.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:24.480]  Oh, no!
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.020]  Oh, what?
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]  Oh, shit!
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:33.540]  What?
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.240]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.260]  Now!
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:45.840]  Ow!
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.960]  How did you kill yourself?
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.160]  I think he ripped the sword out of my hand
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.120]  and I fell on it.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.700]  Oh, come on!
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.100]  I got hit with a net in a different room.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.360]  No!
[01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:10.050]  Ow!
[01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:13.190]  Oh!
[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:15.870]  I wanted it to fall on you, Gavin.
[01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:17.410]  Wait a minute. Hold on.
[01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:18.770]  Hold on.
[01:07:19.830 --> 01:07:20.510]  Here we go.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:23.430]  We're both out!
[01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.350]  You guys are both out. You suck.
[01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:31.310]  The sword fell on you.
[01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:32.030]  Damn!
[01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.690]  Oh, let's see this.
[01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:35.510]  That's it.
[01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.290]  Let's see who did it.
[01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:38.810]  Nine!
[01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:43.810]  And...
[01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.830]  Twelve!
[01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:49.890]  Ten!
[01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:58.750]  Guys, that's it.
[01:07:58.850 --> 01:07:59.890]  It's Duck Game
