[00:00.000 --> 00:00.940]  How do I get in?
[00:01.820 --> 00:02.480]  I sent you an invite.
[00:03.160 --> 00:04.560]  It should... to Steam?
[00:05.120 --> 00:06.100]  No, on Xbox.
[00:08.240 --> 00:10.060]  Did you buy the wrong version of the game?
[00:10.640 --> 00:11.560]  It's cross-play.
[00:11.760 --> 00:12.500]  It should be cross-play.
[00:13.140 --> 00:13.820]  Is it cross-play?
[00:14.200 --> 00:14.880]  I think so.
[00:15.120 --> 00:16.520]  Why would you buy it on Steam?
[00:18.680 --> 00:24.860]  When I specifically, I wrote in the thing, an Xbox couch and stated,
[00:25.200 --> 00:26.980]  Nick and I both have it.
[00:28.000 --> 00:29.340]  What a wild move by you.
[00:32.340 --> 00:32.860]  Um...
[00:33.560 --> 00:35.100]  You can see if it's cross-play.
[00:35.240 --> 00:35.760]  Maybe it's cross-play.
[00:35.940 --> 00:38.520]  It says, has finally launched with cross-play support.
[00:38.960 --> 00:39.260]  Okay.
[00:39.600 --> 00:43.020]  How do we get him in here?
[00:43.420 --> 00:44.340]  Do you cross-play?
[00:44.620 --> 00:46.580]  What a wild move.
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.020]  Holy fuck, man.
[00:48.460 --> 00:52.540]  It's just, there are times where I definitely fuck up the communication.
[00:52.960 --> 00:53.880]  This is not one.
[00:54.000 --> 00:55.480]  I was incredibly clear.
[00:56.340 --> 00:58.760]  I guess because I've always just played Outlast on PC.
[00:59.540 --> 01:01.100]  Which is where my mind went.
[01:02.540 --> 01:04.060]  I also have it on PC.
[01:04.280 --> 01:05.300]  Uh, but.
[01:05.680 --> 01:06.500]  Oh, moron.
[01:06.840 --> 01:07.060]  And Xbox.
[01:08.920 --> 01:09.440]  Uh...
[01:11.940 --> 01:18.700]  I don't even think we're Steam friends, Gavin.
[01:18.700 --> 01:21.720]  I wake up as me every day and it's not great.
[01:22.060 --> 01:27.320]  I, I am loving this because I have had a rough summer where I have been distracted
[01:27.320 --> 01:29.220]  and essentially dumb all summer.
[01:29.460 --> 01:33.380]  And seeing you guys be stupid is real, makes me feel real good about myself.
[01:34.500 --> 01:35.920]  Oh, you're in my cell, Geoff.
[01:36.460 --> 01:37.940]  My cell now, bitch.
[01:38.280 --> 01:39.620]  It's my cell now.
[01:40.060 --> 01:41.360]  This is my toilet paper.
[01:41.860 --> 01:45.760]  This is my copy of Fizzmat magazine.
[01:46.540 --> 01:54.540]  This is my, uh, go to the friends tab and then click add a friend and you can give
[01:54.540 --> 01:57.300]  Gavin your code and he should be able to add you as a friend.
[01:57.320 --> 01:58.860]  I had dumbbells.
[01:59.020 --> 02:01.240]  I got a copy of Air 50 magazine.
[02:01.780 --> 02:02.920]  Oh, it's fucking hell.
[02:04.600 --> 02:07.280]  Andrew, just so you know, I put my balls on everything in your room.
[02:08.000 --> 02:08.460]  Oh, good.
[02:08.900 --> 02:12.200]  He's still working on getting Gavin in here so you can put your balls on him.
[02:12.620 --> 02:13.820]  Yeah, I'll be doing that soon, too.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.360]  Hey, you're in here, right, Nick?
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.100]  Is that you running around?
[02:16.780 --> 02:18.180]  Yeah, I'm Gavin for this code.
[02:18.920 --> 02:20.200]  Are you Beard Bunny?
[02:20.600 --> 02:21.340]  Where do I put the code?
[02:21.540 --> 02:22.740]  Who the fuck is Border Bunny?
[02:23.640 --> 02:24.360]  Push start.
[02:24.740 --> 02:25.600]  Oh, I think this is like.
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.200]  You know, there's a lot of people, there's yummy chicken nuggie.
[02:29.200 --> 02:31.320]  Can you hit enter a friend code?
[02:31.460 --> 02:32.100]  Come here a second, Nick.
[02:32.380 --> 02:32.800]  Stand still.
[02:33.360 --> 02:34.740]  Can you hit B to bend down?
[02:35.540 --> 02:37.880]  Yeah, I just need to put myself right here.
[02:38.020 --> 02:38.100]  Yeah.
[02:38.120 --> 02:38.440]  What's that?
[02:40.080 --> 02:42.580]  B9 3C dash B.
[02:42.640 --> 02:43.320]  All right, that's good.
[02:43.580 --> 02:43.980]  Appreciate it.
[02:46.180 --> 02:48.040]  B9 3C dash.
[02:48.220 --> 02:48.680]  What just happened?
[02:48.980 --> 02:50.740]  Eight or no, E8.
[02:51.600 --> 02:52.000]  Eight.
[02:54.740 --> 02:55.140]  What?
[02:56.200 --> 02:57.120]  E8 EB.
[02:59.020 --> 03:00.100]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:00.220 --> 03:00.660]  That's my guess.
[03:01.100 --> 03:05.960]  It was bad when there was a second conversation happening at the same time.
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.900]  It was worse when there was no other conversation, but the wrong thing kept
[03:09.900 --> 03:10.520]  getting said.
[03:15.080 --> 03:16.040]  You get it?
[03:20.680 --> 03:21.600]  B9 3C.
[03:22.560 --> 03:24.340]  I guess I'm put in the wrong place.
[03:26.280 --> 03:29.000]  There's there's only one place to put it.
[03:29.300 --> 03:30.380]  Okay, what's your friend code?
[03:30.660 --> 03:32.140]  Let me try to enter it for you.
[03:33.680 --> 03:34.620]  On Steam?
[03:35.540 --> 03:35.840]  No.
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.240]  Oh, God.
[03:38.740 --> 03:40.420]  No, go into the game.
[03:40.840 --> 03:40.920]  Yeah.
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.880]  Push start.
[03:46.280 --> 03:46.820]  Yeah.
[03:47.320 --> 03:50.380]  You see the current group tab on the left.
[03:50.520 --> 03:51.120]  It pops up.
[03:51.240 --> 03:51.940]  It's under menu.
[03:52.320 --> 03:52.540]  Yeah.
[03:53.260 --> 03:54.280]  Click invite.
[03:55.620 --> 03:57.140]  Oh, I don't see invite.
[04:02.400 --> 04:04.860]  Okay, now Gavin just invited me via Steam.
[04:04.860 --> 04:05.320]  Sorry.
[04:05.620 --> 04:05.800]  Hold on.
[04:06.100 --> 04:06.220]  Giles.
[04:08.960 --> 04:10.740]  Is this the video?
[04:11.340 --> 04:12.940]  Is this the shitty video?
[04:12.940 --> 04:13.780]  It has to be.
[04:14.180 --> 04:15.960]  Now, click X.
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.300]  I'm like, I'm like three wrong button presses away from a total meltdown.
[04:24.160 --> 04:25.300]  There we go.
[04:28.820 --> 04:32.080]  Oh, invite to invite.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.080]  Oh, Christ.
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.520]  There is no way we're going to successfully complete any of these trials.
[04:39.960 --> 04:40.800]  We're dead as dicks.
[04:43.380 --> 04:45.000]  Man, it sucks to be me.
[04:47.820 --> 04:50.060]  Oh, shit, Geoff, are you arm wrestling somebody?
[04:50.220 --> 04:51.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[04:51.060 --> 04:51.420]  I don't know.
[04:51.520 --> 04:52.300]  Holy shit.
[04:52.320 --> 04:53.760]  I got my ass kicked by a nugget.
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.580]  Hey, welcome to the video that started probably 10 minutes ago.
[04:57.620 --> 04:58.080]  I don't know.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.480]  I don't know when it fucking began.
[04:59.780 --> 05:00.820]  You know better than I do.
[05:01.020 --> 05:02.840]  We're playing Outlast Trials.
[05:03.080 --> 05:05.340]  Then if we have time, we do Left 4 Dead.
[05:05.600 --> 05:09.180]  Sounds like someone who doesn't believe in us proved me wrong, I guess.
[05:10.940 --> 05:16.860]  So I accidentally downloaded the game on Steam in what's been known as a wild move.
[05:18.180 --> 05:22.740]  Well, it was wild move because it was clearly stated as we're all playing on Xbox
[05:23.300 --> 05:27.680]  and then you just decided to buy it on Steam because when you hear Outlast,
[05:27.680 --> 05:28.780]  you think of PC.
[05:29.160 --> 05:32.340]  OK, programs, your rebirth is a journey separated into clusters of trials
[05:32.340 --> 05:33.320]  called programs.
[05:33.500 --> 05:34.400]  What do we want to do?
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.580]  Core therapy, special therapy or endurance therapy?
[05:39.160 --> 05:41.400]  I think Gavin needs special therapy.
[05:44.520 --> 05:45.920]  Special therapy, can't damn.
[05:46.220 --> 05:49.460]  Reagent rigs are outfitted with an explosive that will detonate
[05:49.460 --> 05:50.820]  when the timer reaches zero.
[05:51.100 --> 05:51.520]  Oh, cool.
[05:51.520 --> 05:53.640]  Time extenders to buy yourself extra seconds.
[05:53.860 --> 05:56.900]  Even if you survive this trial someday, time will kill you.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.080]  OK, pressing. OK, thanks, game.
[06:01.620 --> 06:03.600]  Oh, we got a bunch of like levels.
[06:04.080 --> 06:04.660]  Happy Halloween.
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.360]  Kill the snitch.
[06:07.600 --> 06:08.640]  Vindicate the guilty.
[06:08.840 --> 06:10.200]  Teach the police officer.
[06:10.900 --> 06:11.560]  Empty the vault.
[06:12.780 --> 06:13.980]  Drill the Futterman.
[06:14.560 --> 06:16.180]  How do we drill a Futterman?
[06:16.440 --> 06:17.660]  Do we got to drill the Futterman?
[06:17.860 --> 06:20.000]  We got to fucking drill this Futterman, dude.
[06:20.420 --> 06:21.340]  People are not toys.
[06:21.480 --> 06:24.520]  Stop Mother Gooseberry from making a human Dr.
[06:24.620 --> 06:25.140]  Futterman.
[06:25.660 --> 06:27.420]  This is going to be a reference.
[06:27.620 --> 06:28.840]  It's probably only for me.
[06:29.060 --> 06:33.020]  But a drill, the Futterman sounds like a Cat Stevens song from the 70s.
[06:33.100 --> 06:33.820]  T for the T-Man.
[06:34.300 --> 06:35.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[06:36.060 --> 06:37.400]  That's the first thing I thought.
[06:39.080 --> 06:39.860]  Here we go.
[06:40.320 --> 06:41.140]  Here we go.
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.260]  Preparing the trial.
[06:45.140 --> 06:47.060]  Drill for the Futterman.
[06:56.940 --> 06:58.540]  Nobody wants to play a game.
[06:58.740 --> 07:00.840]  All is forgiven for your Steam purchase.
[07:02.140 --> 07:04.280]  Why won't anyone play a game with me?
[07:05.320 --> 07:08.020]  We got three. I'm at chess one.
[07:08.780 --> 07:09.500]  Hey, I'm here.
[07:14.380 --> 07:18.500]  OK, so I did the tutorial for this game about five, six months ago.
[07:18.800 --> 07:21.020]  Oh, but it hasn't happened since then, right?
[07:21.060 --> 07:22.080]  So I did it this morning.
[07:22.900 --> 07:25.620]  Geoff and Gavin haven't touched it.
[07:25.860 --> 07:27.300]  So Nick, you're leading us.
[07:27.600 --> 07:30.200]  Oh, uh, look at this.
[07:30.860 --> 07:33.580]  You're the Nick spurt expert.
[07:33.780 --> 07:35.200]  Are we going to go to the fun park?
[07:35.540 --> 07:36.400]  Oh, we got to sit in the chairs.
[07:36.900 --> 07:37.680]  Oh, we got to sit in the chairs.
[07:37.780 --> 07:39.900]  OK, we get strapped in.
[07:40.280 --> 07:41.100]  This is where we.
[07:42.280 --> 07:43.420]  This is the one anyway.
[07:44.200 --> 07:46.040]  I got my balls all over your chair, Geoff.
[07:46.480 --> 07:49.580]  What? Oh, fall out.
[07:52.080 --> 07:54.760]  I needed one of these to show Gavin how to send a friend request
[07:54.760 --> 07:55.660]  in this fucking game.
[07:56.020 --> 07:57.380]  He had a full video tutorial.
[07:57.920 --> 07:59.400]  What do you say about balls to me, Andrew?
[08:00.880 --> 08:01.840]  Balls on your chair.
[08:02.200 --> 08:03.460]  Oh, fucking finally.
[08:03.660 --> 08:06.780]  I had to make up that whole thing where I rubbed my balls on all your stuff
[08:06.780 --> 08:09.420]  just to anger you so that you could rub your balls on my stuff
[08:09.420 --> 08:10.740]  because I'm addicted to balls.
[08:11.300 --> 08:11.980]  Oh, shit.
[08:12.400 --> 08:13.680]  What was bulls on my chair?
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.880]  Oh, oh, green names.
[08:17.460 --> 08:18.300]  That's not good.
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.040]  Oh, shit.
[08:20.040 --> 08:21.480]  Someone got stabbed in the eye.
[08:23.640 --> 08:24.180]  What?
[08:25.760 --> 08:26.300]  What?
[08:27.160 --> 08:28.580]  Make it rain.
[08:28.860 --> 08:30.240]  This is too dumb to be scary.
[08:31.240 --> 08:33.320]  They're brainstabbing my heart.
[08:33.420 --> 08:34.940]  That's me. I don't like that.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.340]  Oh, they've got drill hands.
[08:37.580 --> 08:39.000]  It's like BioShock.
[08:39.400 --> 08:41.120]  Doctors in the 1930s.
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.220]  Little Daddy.
[08:43.480 --> 08:45.840]  It's just a trip to the dentist in 1917.
[08:47.560 --> 08:49.060]  Oh, God, dentist.
[08:49.180 --> 08:50.080]  They were at the fun park.
[08:52.400 --> 08:53.360]  Fun park.
[08:54.200 --> 08:54.900]  All right.
[08:56.320 --> 08:57.540]  Looks like we'll go through these.
[08:58.900 --> 09:00.380]  Oh, it's dark in there.
[09:00.760 --> 09:01.220]  It's dark.
[09:02.660 --> 09:03.700]  Drill the Futterman.
[09:04.340 --> 09:06.840]  Is there a night... Oh, two, three minutes.
[09:06.940 --> 09:08.120]  Night vision is wide.
[09:08.740 --> 09:10.680]  Guys, night vision is wide. B is crouch.
[09:11.220 --> 09:12.140]  X is hide.
[09:13.300 --> 09:13.860]  B is hide.
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.800]  X is the action button.
[09:16.360 --> 09:17.580]  Kill Mr. Futterman.
[09:17.580 --> 09:20.340]  Okay, we have to kill this fucking guy.
[09:20.720 --> 09:22.260]  To sprint, you hold down the left stick.
[09:22.260 --> 09:23.920]  Should we go to the Canal B?
[09:24.400 --> 09:25.100]  I got a bottle.
[09:25.940 --> 09:27.320]  Canal B or Canal A?
[09:28.020 --> 09:29.080]  I think two and two.
[09:29.260 --> 09:29.860]  Oh, we can't go up there.
[09:29.900 --> 09:30.580]  Two and two. I'm going left.
[09:31.060 --> 09:31.960]  I'll go left.
[09:31.980 --> 09:33.580]  I've seen what Gavin's capable of.
[09:33.760 --> 09:35.080]  Oh, no, I won't be Gavin.
[09:35.640 --> 09:36.320]  Oh, we're fucked.
[09:36.720 --> 09:39.840]  All right, Gavin, don't forget to hit Y.
[09:40.820 --> 09:42.260]  Oh, shit, I got electrocuted.
[09:42.460 --> 09:43.680]  How do you hide? What is it again?
[09:43.800 --> 09:44.740]  What the fuck?
[09:44.740 --> 09:45.700]  What the fuck?
[09:46.720 --> 09:49.060]  Watch your steps. Broken glass and noise traps.
[09:50.480 --> 09:51.740]  Oh, I should have read that.
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.880]  I seem to be hallucinating.
[09:55.420 --> 09:56.900]  That's cool. Oh, good.
[09:57.020 --> 09:57.980]  I love all this teeth.
[09:58.000 --> 09:59.500]  I can't get enough teeth stuff right now.
[09:59.640 --> 10:00.800]  I grabbed the heart.
[10:01.980 --> 10:03.320]  How do I get to the health gun?
[10:05.220 --> 10:06.060]  Oh, shit.
[10:06.120 --> 10:07.280]  I don't think it's going to blow me up.
[10:07.500 --> 10:08.380]  Geoff, I got a syringe.
[10:09.240 --> 10:09.980]  You got a syringe?
[10:10.880 --> 10:12.320]  Inject to revive friends.
[10:12.560 --> 10:14.620]  Oh, Geoff, I can revive you.
[10:14.620 --> 10:16.940]  Well, I hope I don't need it, but thank you.
[10:17.680 --> 10:18.500]  What is happening?
[10:18.640 --> 10:19.700]  Watch out for the noise traps.
[10:20.180 --> 10:21.200]  Oh, I picked up some stuff.
[10:21.360 --> 10:25.080]  I picked up a press right to get a recharged night vision battery.
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.880]  I'm hiding. There was noise.
[10:27.080 --> 10:27.360]  What was that?
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.440]  Was that me? Am I noise?
[10:30.320 --> 10:31.320]  You think I'm going to hit the target?
[10:31.540 --> 10:32.840]  I see. I got it. I got it.
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.880]  I got it. Oh, what do we hear?
[10:34.940 --> 10:36.000]  What we got to do? There we go.
[10:36.680 --> 10:39.100]  Nice. Something weird is going around.
[10:39.300 --> 10:40.620]  Five targets remaining. Fuck.
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.400]  What are the targets like?
[10:42.600 --> 10:43.500]  Yeah, what do they look like?
[10:43.980 --> 10:47.720]  They're like a little circular thing that go left and right.
[10:47.920 --> 10:48.900]  Shoot the target.
[10:49.180 --> 10:52.120]  OK, because Brie's office, what targets?
[10:53.920 --> 10:55.620]  Hey, Andrew, what do the targets look like?
[10:55.920 --> 10:58.120]  We've got a little circular things that go left and right.
[10:58.220 --> 11:00.160]  I see one. It's like a duck's face.
[11:00.260 --> 11:00.940]  Do you have a gun, Gav?
[11:01.520 --> 11:02.260]  I got a syringe.
[11:02.380 --> 11:04.940]  Oh, we got we got hearts to throw.
[11:05.860 --> 11:09.080]  Oh. I see.
[11:09.360 --> 11:10.460]  Throw, hold and throw.
[11:10.700 --> 11:12.100]  Hold left trigger and throw with right.
[11:12.100 --> 11:12.800]  What are we throwing at?
[11:13.660 --> 11:14.500]  The targets.
[11:14.740 --> 11:16.160]  Andrew, what do the targets look like?
[11:16.520 --> 11:18.240]  They're circular and they move left and right.
[11:19.320 --> 11:20.560]  Oh, there you go.
[11:20.960 --> 11:21.320]  Got it.
[11:21.340 --> 11:23.700]  You didn't say that there's a duck face on it. Why?
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.060]  Oh, I didn't know there was a duck face on it.
[11:26.220 --> 11:27.200]  Oh, OK. OK.
[11:27.920 --> 11:28.880]  I don't see the next one.
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.540]  Damn it. Oh shit.
[11:30.560 --> 11:32.140]  The game keeps tricking Nick.
[11:32.380 --> 11:33.360]  It's been very funny.
[11:34.560 --> 11:35.920]  I keep getting poisoned.
[11:36.400 --> 11:37.780]  Nick keeps getting tricked.
[11:38.160 --> 11:39.040]  Oh, man, this is great.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.380]  Do you see any other
[11:41.340 --> 11:42.560]  places to throw the heart?
[11:42.860 --> 11:44.060]  There's a man in here.
[11:44.160 --> 11:45.160]  I got one.
[11:45.240 --> 11:46.420]  Oh, wait, maybe if I missed.
[11:47.020 --> 11:48.600]  Oh, we have 13 seconds.
[11:49.020 --> 11:50.380]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.400]  Oh, balls to die.
[11:52.840 --> 11:54.140]  Oh, to throw stuff.
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.040]  I found a bunch of targets.
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.340]  What do the targets look like?
[11:56.540 --> 11:57.060]  They're circular.
[11:57.180 --> 11:57.880]  They got a duck on them.
[11:57.900 --> 11:58.560]  They go left to right.
[11:58.720 --> 12:00.000]  I threw my heart as someone said.
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.220]  Oh, I just blew up.
[12:02.360 --> 12:04.560]  OK, that was a good learning round.
[12:05.160 --> 12:06.880]  Was it? I don't think I learned that much.
[12:07.120 --> 12:08.000]  I learned a lot.
[12:08.420 --> 12:09.500]  You grab the hearts,
[12:09.500 --> 12:10.800]  you throw the hearts at the targets.
[12:10.860 --> 12:11.780]  You got to break the targets.
[12:11.880 --> 12:12.340]  They're circular.
[12:12.500 --> 12:13.120]  They have a duck in them.
[12:13.160 --> 12:13.800]  They go left and right.
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.680]  We only found one target.
[12:15.820 --> 12:16.640]  Yeah, we found one target.
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.800]  Yeah, you got to explore the area.
[12:17.880 --> 12:18.380]  Let's retry.
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.420]  Let's redo that.
[12:19.740 --> 12:21.180]  Great F. Fuck yeah.
[12:22.140 --> 12:23.900]  Nick found one and Andrew found one.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.180]  That's two. You guys found one.
[12:25.260 --> 12:25.780]  That's three.
[12:25.980 --> 12:26.860]  So there's five totally.
[12:27.940 --> 12:30.400]  I found I think it's five on each side
[12:30.400 --> 12:31.280]  because I found three.
[12:33.700 --> 12:36.220]  At least you guys know what to do this time, right?
[12:36.400 --> 12:37.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[12:37.700 --> 12:39.080]  I'm going to fucking nail these targets.
[12:40.680 --> 12:41.880]  There's a ghost, I think,
[12:41.980 --> 12:43.920]  and we're supposed to be quiet to not alert the ghost.
[12:44.040 --> 12:44.460]  So I don't care.
[12:44.540 --> 12:47.460]  I'm going to fucking throw these targets or these hearts at the targets.
[12:47.580 --> 12:49.040]  So we have to find the other duck heads.
[12:50.540 --> 12:51.640]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[12:51.760 --> 12:53.720]  You throw a heart at the first duck.
[12:53.820 --> 12:54.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:55.460 --> 12:57.360]  Nick, let's hit all our targets before they do.
[12:57.380 --> 12:58.100]  Yeah, let's do it.
[12:58.660 --> 12:59.360]  Please do that.
[12:59.520 --> 13:01.040]  That'd be fucking awesome if you guys did that.
[13:03.600 --> 13:04.200]  Drool the Futtermen.
[13:04.740 --> 13:06.220]  All right. Two minutes, 56 seconds.
[13:06.220 --> 13:07.240]  Drool the Futtermen.
[13:09.060 --> 13:11.100]  All right, just and watch out for the tracks, Andrew.
[13:11.740 --> 13:13.260]  That's what got you last time.
[13:13.620 --> 13:13.780]  Yep.
[13:14.380 --> 13:15.940]  Oh, I stepped in one instantly.
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.460]  So, hey, remember when he told you to watch out for the tracks?
[13:18.460 --> 13:19.920]  Well, yeah, sure do.
[13:20.040 --> 13:21.300]  And then he ran over the glass.
[13:21.580 --> 13:21.820]  Absolutely.
[13:22.140 --> 13:24.320]  I thought it was the next one up.
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.520]  That's that's on me.
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.660]  OK, duck one is down.
[13:28.140 --> 13:30.380]  OK, going to where I found the other ducks.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.580]  All right, I have a duck sitting here.
[13:32.880 --> 13:33.220]  Throwing a duck.
[13:33.260 --> 13:33.780]  No, it's not.
[13:33.980 --> 13:34.700]  Duck down.
[13:35.160 --> 13:36.320]  They've moved the ducks.
[13:36.560 --> 13:38.260]  I think that exhibit A has one.
[13:38.760 --> 13:40.300]  Oh, fuck. What the hell was that?
[13:41.880 --> 13:42.020]  Oh.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.280]  Oh, God.
[13:44.840 --> 13:45.620]  Oh, wait, why did I do that?
[13:45.720 --> 13:48.100]  I just got a duck blew up on me.
[13:49.340 --> 13:49.900]  Ducked it.
[13:50.660 --> 13:52.440]  Oh, Geoff, there's a duck here.
[13:52.640 --> 13:54.120]  OK. In this room.
[13:54.600 --> 13:55.560]  I sure am.
[13:55.600 --> 13:56.180]  I got another duck.
[13:57.180 --> 13:58.400]  In the room with this man.
[13:58.700 --> 13:59.300]  Oh, shit.
[14:00.420 --> 14:01.340]  What? You keep saying heart.
[14:01.460 --> 14:03.100]  You mean brick? They're bricks, right?
[14:03.620 --> 14:04.260]  No, they're hearts.
[14:04.260 --> 14:05.280]  Right. I got it.
[14:05.360 --> 14:05.940]  I got a heart.
[14:06.140 --> 14:06.600]  Oh, yeah.
[14:06.640 --> 14:07.440]  Geoff, come to me.
[14:07.600 --> 14:08.120]  I'm coming.
[14:08.720 --> 14:09.820]  Nick's picking up bricks.
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.360]  I have a brick.
[14:11.500 --> 14:11.920]  Yeah, where is it?
[14:12.300 --> 14:13.740]  I don't. It's on the wall behind that guy.
[14:13.940 --> 14:14.620]  Oh, I see.
[14:15.300 --> 14:15.860]  I got it.
[14:16.140 --> 14:17.360]  I don't know if it'll wake the guy up.
[14:17.380 --> 14:17.960]  I don't know how to.
[14:18.360 --> 14:19.660]  How do I drop the fucking.
[14:20.040 --> 14:21.020]  I have this d-pad.
[14:21.960 --> 14:23.140]  How many ducks have you hit, Andrew?
[14:24.640 --> 14:24.860]  Where?
[14:25.100 --> 14:26.460]  All right, we hit the duck.
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.520]  Oh, I found a duck.
[14:32.340 --> 14:33.060]  Oh, shit.
[14:33.180 --> 14:34.200]  That was what I found.
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.080]  Oh, he's behind me.
[14:36.180 --> 14:36.960]  He's behind me.
[14:37.120 --> 14:37.820]  I'm closing the door.
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.720]  Does not.
[14:41.020 --> 14:42.520]  All right, I think we have to figure out how to get Nick.
[14:42.620 --> 14:44.040]  We got to find these other ducks.
[14:44.300 --> 14:46.720]  I know. I'm looking down here.
[14:46.960 --> 14:48.380]  Keep it going, Andrew.
[14:48.700 --> 14:49.480]  I found one.
[14:49.880 --> 14:50.800]  I see. Oh, wait, I found one.
[14:51.640 --> 14:52.280]  Oh, you got it.
[14:52.660 --> 14:53.940]  We only need one more duck.
[14:56.200 --> 14:59.320]  I. Oh, Geoff, duck, duck, duck, duck, dick.
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.540]  All right, I'm running to get a heart.
[15:02.320 --> 15:03.620]  Oh, I'm coming in here.
[15:04.300 --> 15:04.920]  Oh, shit.
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.740]  There's a big guy in your in your eyes chasing us.
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.220]  Oh, I got it.
[15:16.220 --> 15:17.420]  I got I got the last update.
[15:17.520 --> 15:18.680]  I got it. Go, go, go.
[15:18.780 --> 15:20.160]  Ah, I ran into him.
[15:20.220 --> 15:21.280]  All right. I hit me.
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.340]  He does a lot of damage.
[15:22.480 --> 15:23.360]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[15:23.920 --> 15:25.260]  Where are you supposed to go?
[15:25.260 --> 15:26.660]  Up the stairs.
[15:26.960 --> 15:27.940]  Oh, hell yeah.
[15:28.640 --> 15:29.560]  Oh, shit, Geoff.
[15:29.640 --> 15:30.100]  There's a man.
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.040]  There's a man.
[15:33.120 --> 15:34.440]  Oh, yeah, I see him.
[15:34.700 --> 15:35.880]  Let's use a time extender.
[15:36.460 --> 15:37.260]  Oh, shit.
[15:37.360 --> 15:38.220]  I got bumped on.
[15:39.280 --> 15:41.640]  OK, you guys need to hit your ducks.
[15:41.800 --> 15:42.880]  We hit three ducks.
[15:42.940 --> 15:43.920]  How many do we need to hit?
[15:44.160 --> 15:45.920]  Five ducks.
[15:46.400 --> 15:47.760]  Gavin, help me find the ducks.
[15:48.160 --> 15:48.560]  There's a man.
[15:48.560 --> 15:49.440]  I'm running down to help him.
[15:49.580 --> 15:50.440]  Nick, I'm coming to help you.
[15:51.740 --> 15:52.980]  I'm helping him duck.
[15:53.140 --> 15:54.020]  There's a man.
[15:56.060 --> 15:57.680]  All right, there's that duck.
[15:57.780 --> 15:58.440]  I got more time.
[15:58.500 --> 15:59.500]  I got more time.
[15:59.640 --> 16:00.080]  Nice.
[16:01.440 --> 16:01.720]  Geoff.
[16:01.820 --> 16:03.660]  Oh, fuck.
[16:04.360 --> 16:05.920]  Uh, I don't think you got more time.
[16:06.260 --> 16:07.600]  No, I don't know what that was.
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.360]  Andrew Panton is dead, it says.
[16:10.480 --> 16:11.320]  Geoff is dead.
[16:11.500 --> 16:12.320]  Gabby Goo's dead.
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.420]  God.
[16:14.860 --> 16:17.020]  Well, I see there's five ducks in each side.
[16:17.120 --> 16:17.580]  Five ducks.
[16:17.800 --> 16:18.280]  Yeah, three.
[16:19.020 --> 16:19.260]  OK.
[16:19.400 --> 16:20.660]  They move, I think, each time.
[16:21.940 --> 16:22.380]  We're trying.
[16:23.840 --> 16:24.680]  All right, Gavin.
[16:24.680 --> 16:26.840]  Gavin, you got to help me find the other two ducks, OK?
[16:28.980 --> 16:31.240]  Yeah, it's just go in all the rooms.
[16:31.540 --> 16:32.980]  It just seems to be a duck in every room.
[16:33.320 --> 16:34.720]  I'll go ahead and hit the ones.
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.280]  I'll at least try to hit the ones where we know they are.
[16:37.800 --> 16:38.580]  A duck in every room.
[16:40.360 --> 16:41.540]  What do the mines do?
[16:42.660 --> 16:44.060]  They explode if you step on them.
[16:44.900 --> 16:46.720]  Alert the guy with the baseball bat, I think.
[16:48.000 --> 16:48.860]  They might hurt him.
[16:49.140 --> 16:49.500]  I don't know.
[16:51.040 --> 16:52.100]  It'd be nice if they did.
[16:52.640 --> 16:53.640]  How do you skip this?
[16:53.760 --> 16:54.060]  Jeez.
[16:54.060 --> 16:55.960]  I know, it's the fucking worst.
[16:56.120 --> 16:57.100]  By hitting all the ducks.
[16:59.180 --> 17:04.220]  Oh, I'm so pumped to kill Futterman.
[17:07.600 --> 17:08.900]  I hope that guy's Futterman.
[17:09.580 --> 17:12.480]  So the guy that had the baseball bat, did he hurt you, Gavin?
[17:13.840 --> 17:15.600]  Yeah, he smacked me in the back a little bit.
[17:17.480 --> 17:19.260]  Nick was attacked by like a spirit.
[17:20.520 --> 17:22.440]  Yeah, I was in full psychosis, though.
[17:24.880 --> 17:26.600]  Because I stepped on that stupid trap.
[17:27.020 --> 17:27.260]  Yeah.
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.640]  Just don't do that this time.
[17:30.180 --> 17:31.180]  Yeah, good advice.
[17:33.140 --> 17:33.800]  All right.
[17:34.640 --> 17:35.340]  Here we go.
[17:36.500 --> 17:37.480]  This time we got it.
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.240]  I feel good about this one.
[17:39.740 --> 17:40.280]  We got it.
[17:41.720 --> 17:44.400]  I think I have a general idea of where the ducks can be.
[17:44.920 --> 17:47.600]  I know I can now hold multiple hearts at a time.
[17:47.840 --> 17:50.640]  You can hold three items at a time.
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.200]  Just grab...
[17:52.220 --> 17:54.260]  Nick, have you seen hearts at all?
[17:54.380 --> 17:55.460]  No, not at all.
[17:55.580 --> 17:55.840]  Right?
[17:57.880 --> 17:58.600]  It's just been bricks.
[17:58.600 --> 17:59.540]  Going left, going left, going left.
[18:01.220 --> 18:02.420]  Hey, Nick, watch out for the traps.
[18:03.220 --> 18:04.140]  Hearts for me.
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.900]  Yeah, so Nick has bricks and everyone else has hearts?
[18:07.180 --> 18:08.060]  I guess so.
[18:09.520 --> 18:09.880]  Oh.
[18:11.760 --> 18:13.580]  That's awesome. Three hearts. Fucking love it.
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.120]  All right. Heart number one, gone.
[18:15.180 --> 18:16.880]  Dude, I'm bobbing for hearts, dude.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.220]  Oh, oh, wait.
[18:18.300 --> 18:19.960]  Hey, Nick, look to your right. Look at that box down.
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.760]  Heart number two, right here, gone.
[18:23.900 --> 18:24.620]  Oh, yeah.
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.380]  All right, Gavin, that's where they are.
[18:26.420 --> 18:27.220]  Got it. OK.
[18:27.880 --> 18:28.600]  Now I get it.
[18:29.080 --> 18:30.920]  I thought my character was just having a...
[18:30.920 --> 18:32.000]  Yeah, me too. It's something different.
[18:32.460 --> 18:33.180]  Got it. Got it.
[18:33.400 --> 18:34.420]  All right. Nick got one duck.
[18:35.540 --> 18:37.040]  Hey, I know there's another one.
[18:37.120 --> 18:37.820]  There's one, that's three.
[18:38.660 --> 18:40.180]  I think that activates the guy now.
[18:40.380 --> 18:41.700]  All right. Nick got another heart.
[18:42.260 --> 18:43.640]  Oh, there's... I'm sorry, another duck.
[18:43.760 --> 18:45.200]  And then there's another duck in here.
[18:45.300 --> 18:46.180]  Yeah, I just saw it.
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.780]  All right, so we're at three ducks,
[18:48.780 --> 18:51.820]  which is our duck maximum so far on our side.
[18:51.940 --> 18:53.780]  Oh, Andrew might have just gotten that duck.
[18:54.680 --> 18:55.820]  Got it. Watch out for that mine.
[18:56.060 --> 18:56.900]  There you go. All right, cool.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.020]  Did you get it? Got two.
[18:58.160 --> 18:58.840]  How many of you hit?
[18:59.280 --> 19:00.820]  I think two or three.
[19:00.920 --> 19:01.580]  Let's see if we're done.
[19:01.580 --> 19:02.740]  I think two or three.
[19:03.520 --> 19:04.700]  Oh, what are you doing?
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.620]  Ah! Shit, Geoff.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.980]  Oh, balls, run, run, run.
[19:10.080 --> 19:10.980]  We got to find one more.
[19:12.400 --> 19:12.760]  Goodbye.
[19:13.400 --> 19:13.980]  Is a man here?
[19:14.640 --> 19:16.360]  Yeah, there is. Oh, there's two men.
[19:17.000 --> 19:17.520]  Two men.
[19:17.520 --> 19:20.260]  Uh, I may be a little crazy right now.
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.400]  Uh, Andrew, behind you.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.120]  I found it.
[19:24.200 --> 19:25.080]  I found the last duck, Nick.
[19:25.180 --> 19:27.440]  OK, so on the other side, he hit me hard.
[19:27.460 --> 19:28.520]  You just need to go up the...
[19:28.520 --> 19:29.880]  You just need to go up the stairs, Nick.
[19:29.980 --> 19:30.580]  Yeah, go up.
[19:30.780 --> 19:31.600]  He hit me hard.
[19:31.820 --> 19:33.940]  Gavin, you're going to have to find these ducks, man.
[19:34.520 --> 19:35.960]  OK, I'm looking for ducks.
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.780]  Oh, that guy's chasing you, Geoff.
[19:38.380 --> 19:41.140]  I know he he's a real bad guy.
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.000]  Oh, here's a duck.
[19:43.780 --> 19:44.960]  I'm coming. I'm going to make a noise.
[19:45.140 --> 19:46.580]  I missed it, but there's a duck right there.
[19:46.620 --> 19:47.240]  I can't get it.
[19:47.240 --> 19:48.080]  I missed it.
[19:48.220 --> 19:49.120]  I got it.
[19:49.180 --> 19:51.140]  All right. So that's at least four ducks.
[19:52.540 --> 19:54.760]  All right, let's bob for hearts again.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.520]  Need number first.
[19:58.280 --> 19:59.660]  Need duck number five.
[19:59.860 --> 20:01.100]  Duck number five.
[20:01.360 --> 20:01.980]  Where are you?
[20:03.740 --> 20:06.100]  Come on, duck number five.
[20:09.240 --> 20:10.260]  I found it.
[20:12.160 --> 20:13.860]  Jesus, Geoff, did you throw something at me?
[20:14.160 --> 20:14.540]  No.
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.900]  Oh, there's a big guy right next to you.
[20:16.900 --> 20:17.880]  Come on, this way, fellas.
[20:18.440 --> 20:19.680]  Go to where Andrew is.
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.620]  He says there's a duck there.
[20:21.140 --> 20:22.540]  I found it. I got the duck.
[20:22.620 --> 20:23.820]  I just missed three throws.
[20:24.140 --> 20:24.760]  Oh, where is it?
[20:25.040 --> 20:25.560]  It's right here.
[20:25.780 --> 20:26.680]  I got it. I'll get it right here.
[20:26.700 --> 20:27.540]  On the wall, on the wall.
[20:28.360 --> 20:29.100]  Oh, I see it.
[20:29.340 --> 20:29.840]  I missed two.
[20:30.380 --> 20:30.820]  OK, I'll get it.
[20:31.800 --> 20:33.320]  You threw up more than one heart, right?
[20:33.380 --> 20:34.680]  There you go. Nick got it.
[20:34.940 --> 20:35.980]  Nick got it. Up the stairs.
[20:36.660 --> 20:37.760]  Thank you. Go, go, go.
[20:37.820 --> 20:38.280]  Wait, what the?
[20:38.460 --> 20:39.700]  We still have one more.
[20:39.900 --> 20:40.740]  We still have one more.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.380]  How do I throw shit?
[20:46.300 --> 20:49.500]  Oh, big man, big man, big scary man.
[20:49.500 --> 20:50.360]  How do I throw shit?
[20:50.460 --> 20:53.320]  Oh, I just clang-a-langed through all those cans.
[20:53.980 --> 20:55.820]  Where the fuck is your last duck?
[20:56.580 --> 20:57.940]  Oh, God, you scared me.
[20:57.980 --> 20:58.680]  It's a hidden duck.
[20:59.220 --> 20:59.960]  What's this, a bomb?
[21:00.080 --> 21:01.140]  They're all hidden ducks.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.460]  Oh, there's a guy down here.
[21:03.400 --> 21:03.680]  Yep.
[21:04.460 --> 21:05.960]  What happened? Did you guys get the last duck?
[21:07.280 --> 21:08.160]  No. Oh.
[21:08.640 --> 21:09.900]  I've got the ghost.
[21:11.980 --> 21:12.860]  A ghost.
[21:13.260 --> 21:15.020]  Oh, God, I'm being attacked.
[21:16.420 --> 21:17.860]  I'm being attacked by Gavin.
[21:18.180 --> 21:19.660]  Ah, something gross.
[21:19.820 --> 21:20.140]  Who's this?
[21:20.520 --> 21:21.480]  Geoff, there's something on you.
[21:21.800 --> 21:23.040]  I'm going to kick it.
[21:24.580 --> 21:26.120]  Yeah. Oh, shit, I shut the door.
[21:26.320 --> 21:27.120]  I locked you in there.
[21:27.380 --> 21:28.700]  Where is your duck?
[21:29.800 --> 21:31.000]  We need the duck.
[21:32.180 --> 21:33.620]  Oh, I found the last duck.
[21:34.240 --> 21:34.960]  Oh, get it.
[21:35.340 --> 21:36.780]  I got the duck.
[21:36.940 --> 21:38.860]  Go, you got to go, go, go.
[21:39.020 --> 21:40.380]  Escalator, escalator, escalator.
[21:41.920 --> 21:43.040]  I got the duck.
[21:44.760 --> 21:45.120]  Fuck.
[21:45.880 --> 21:47.220]  My bomb is going to go off.
[21:47.340 --> 21:48.960]  Get in here, get in here.
[21:49.520 --> 21:49.880]  Where?
[21:50.220 --> 21:50.780]  I'm coming.
[21:51.160 --> 21:51.940]  Go to Spirit's office.
[21:52.360 --> 21:52.720]  No.
[21:55.300 --> 21:57.420]  Nick went the wrong way the whole time.
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.280]  It was crazy.
[21:58.840 --> 21:59.800]  No, I went up the right stairs.
[21:59.800 --> 22:01.980]  Running into mines and stuff, that was nuts.
[22:02.740 --> 22:03.020]  No.
[22:03.860 --> 22:04.220]  Damn.
[22:04.660 --> 22:05.420]  So, did we do it?
[22:05.900 --> 22:07.300]  No, we got all the ducks, though.
[22:07.500 --> 22:07.820]  Retry.
[22:08.720 --> 22:11.220]  All right, when we got up the stairs, what did we need to do?
[22:11.360 --> 22:11.880]  Or up the path?
[22:11.880 --> 22:12.460]  I don't know.
[22:12.580 --> 22:13.500]  We haven't gotten that far.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.060]  Well, we're going to get there so much faster this time.
[22:15.080 --> 22:19.740]  Once you get up there, there's a room that I think you, like, jump down into.
[22:20.300 --> 22:20.540]  Okay.
[22:20.620 --> 22:20.760]  Yeah.
[22:20.860 --> 22:23.140]  Because I ended up in a stairwell and I didn't know where you guys went.
[22:25.320 --> 22:27.320]  I fell down into the room and then we blew up.
[22:27.580 --> 22:27.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:28.060 --> 22:28.840]  So I didn't know what was in there.
[22:32.160 --> 22:34.960]  All right, well, we'll have some time to collect our thoughts.
[22:36.460 --> 22:37.420]  I'm feeling pretty good about this.
[22:40.080 --> 22:40.980]  Play with me.
[22:40.980 --> 22:43.440]  At least the editor can cut all this part out.
[22:43.840 --> 22:45.020]  I don't like that, Nick.
[22:45.440 --> 22:46.140]  What? What happened?
[22:46.520 --> 22:47.920]  Oh, it did make the cut, so it's okay.
[22:51.660 --> 22:53.460]  Editor, clip that moment, please.
[22:53.880 --> 22:56.120]  Release it as a social clip just by itself.
[22:56.480 --> 22:57.220]  Play with me.
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.800]  Play with me.
[22:59.760 --> 23:01.020]  Play with me.
[23:01.900 --> 23:06.800]  These type of dolls I don't think are scary in media, but would be scary in real life.
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.460]  Something that doesn't translate.
[23:08.840 --> 23:09.120]  I agree.
[23:11.260 --> 23:14.420]  All right, feels like everyone has a good idea about what they're doing here.
[23:15.420 --> 23:16.300]  Hey, we're here.
[23:17.140 --> 23:17.640]  Hey, we made it.
[23:19.560 --> 23:22.240]  I feel the most prepared since we've started.
[23:22.760 --> 23:24.460]  How dangerous are the men that come in?
[23:24.800 --> 23:25.560]  Pretty dangerous.
[23:25.720 --> 23:28.860]  He fucked me up when he hit me with a sledgehammer.
[23:30.180 --> 23:34.180]  Okay, so we gotta find the radio or something.
[23:34.480 --> 23:35.600]  Yeah, stop the radio broadcast.
[23:36.020 --> 23:37.480]  What causes us to get together?
[23:38.900 --> 23:42.060]  We finish before you and then Randy and I have to try to help.
[23:42.400 --> 23:43.940]  Nice, that's one for Nick.
[23:44.760 --> 23:46.420]  Damn, I nailed that.
[23:46.880 --> 23:48.630]  All right, first duck is down.
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.900]  Second duck is down.
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.020]  All right, Nick hit a second duck.
[24:01.680 --> 24:02.900]  I hit a third duck.
[24:03.780 --> 24:05.840]  Oh my God, there's something in a barrel!
[24:06.760 --> 24:09.240]  Mash to free me! I got a mash!
[24:09.720 --> 24:10.680]  Nick got his...
[24:10.680 --> 24:11.620]  Holy shit!
[24:11.740 --> 24:13.680]  Nick got the third duck, so that's four total.
[24:14.660 --> 24:15.380]  One more.
[24:15.580 --> 24:17.320]  I think it's the way that you were going.
[24:18.380 --> 24:18.860]  I think so.
[24:19.300 --> 24:19.940]  Got another duck.
[24:20.420 --> 24:21.360]  All right, there were two in here.
[24:21.360 --> 24:21.980]  Three for us.
[24:23.060 --> 24:24.740]  I got duck, hold on.
[24:25.040 --> 24:27.140]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!
[24:27.480 --> 24:28.680]  Oh, Andrew's coming that way!
[24:29.300 --> 24:30.060]  That's real bad.
[24:30.340 --> 24:31.820]  It's real bad everywhere.
[24:31.880 --> 24:32.720]  Oh, there's two guys.
[24:32.960 --> 24:33.300]  Oh shit.
[24:33.480 --> 24:33.840]  Yeah, there sure are.
[24:34.540 --> 24:36.300]  I think you already got the duck in this room.
[24:36.960 --> 24:38.340]  But there were two in there last time.
[24:38.340 --> 24:40.680]  All right, Gavin, it's gotta be over on the other side where you are.
[24:41.040 --> 24:42.800]  I'm hiding, there's a man here.
[24:42.980 --> 24:44.800]  Got it! All right, got all the ducks on our side.
[24:44.860 --> 24:46.660]  Got it? Okay, sweet. Good job, Nick.
[24:46.940 --> 24:49.000]  Gotta run, Nick. I think you gotta go up and help them.
[24:49.540 --> 24:51.640]  We're at four ducks and Gavin's hiding.
[24:51.840 --> 24:52.240]  Just be careful.
[24:52.240 --> 24:53.280]  Nope, we need one more duck.
[24:53.620 --> 24:53.860]  What?
[24:54.860 --> 24:55.740]  Oh yeah, we sure do.
[24:55.960 --> 24:57.220]  Nick, did you hit four?
[24:57.460 --> 24:58.520]  I hit one.
[25:01.940 --> 25:03.140]  I got it, I got it.
[25:03.140 --> 25:06.080]  No! I'm getting fucking jumped on again!
[25:06.380 --> 25:08.200]  The last one's in here with me!
[25:09.520 --> 25:10.560]  Gotta go to where Andrew is.
[25:10.860 --> 25:11.040]  Yeah.
[25:11.660 --> 25:12.540]  Gav, get us out of here.
[25:12.720 --> 25:13.360]  God damn.
[25:14.540 --> 25:15.820]  Beating the fuck out of me.
[25:16.400 --> 25:16.800]  Got it.
[25:17.140 --> 25:17.540]  Go!
[25:20.060 --> 25:21.340]  There's a guy running with you.
[25:21.800 --> 25:22.720]  There's still one fire.
[25:23.020 --> 25:23.740]  Fuck, that's locked.
[25:24.020 --> 25:24.920]  Come on, come on, Andrew.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.260]  We gotta find the last duck, Gavin.
[25:26.440 --> 25:27.200]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.220]  I thought we had it.
[25:28.600 --> 25:30.400]  No, we've got four, we need five.
[25:31.140 --> 25:32.240]  You gotta find it.
[25:32.720 --> 25:33.640]  Watch out for that mine.
[25:34.000 --> 25:34.980]  Oh yeah, good call.
[25:35.140 --> 25:37.380]  You were just gonna run right into it.
[25:37.600 --> 25:39.620]  No, I saw it as you said it.
[25:39.620 --> 25:39.860]  Can you go hard at it?
[25:40.780 --> 25:42.240]  Oh, that's a good question. Let's find out.
[25:43.200 --> 25:43.380]  Yep.
[25:44.380 --> 25:44.660]  Okay.
[25:45.000 --> 25:45.680]  That works.
[25:45.720 --> 25:46.620]  Just open the door!
[25:47.740 --> 25:49.560]  Gavin, it's getting rough, man.
[25:50.020 --> 25:50.260]  Fuck.
[25:50.340 --> 25:52.100]  Where's the god damn other duck?
[25:52.740 --> 25:53.420]  I'm getting fucked up.
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.400]  Wait, couldn't we just not do the... oh, I guess we still need him.
[25:56.540 --> 25:57.320]  I'm just about there.
[25:57.620 --> 25:58.660]  The only way... guy in a barrel!
[25:59.080 --> 26:00.140]  Yeah, he sure is.
[26:01.060 --> 26:04.020]  You need it because it's the only way that big door opens.
[26:04.440 --> 26:05.300]  Oh, you're right, you're right.
[26:06.640 --> 26:07.620]  Wait, I hear a radio.
[26:08.820 --> 26:10.300]  We're supposed to find a radio.
[26:10.820 --> 26:10.980]  Yeah.
[26:11.920 --> 26:12.640]  Is it that?
[26:13.780 --> 26:14.180]  Silence.
[26:14.640 --> 26:15.020]  Oh, okay.
[26:15.480 --> 26:16.140]  I stopped the broadcast!
[26:16.360 --> 26:16.840]  Oh, wow!
[26:17.420 --> 26:18.420]  Hey, Nick found the radio!
[26:18.500 --> 26:19.420]  Oh, we have seven seconds!
[26:20.500 --> 26:21.840]  How's the bomb situation?
[26:22.300 --> 26:22.660]  Not good.
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.240]  They didn't get maximum duckage.
[26:30.140 --> 26:31.980]  I feel like Gavin's lacking on the ducks.
[26:32.260 --> 26:33.680]  I think he's having duck troubles.
[26:34.060 --> 26:35.700]  I hit a bunch of ducks! What do you have for me?
[26:36.660 --> 26:37.620]  To hit all the ducks.
[26:39.940 --> 26:41.640]  I feel like I'm only hearing Geoff.
[26:41.800 --> 26:43.760]  I'm good for three ducks every time.
[26:44.040 --> 26:46.140]  I don't know, I've never found more than three.
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.760]  You didn't find three that time, though.
[26:48.040 --> 26:48.560]  Yes, I did.
[26:49.100 --> 26:49.540]  You did?
[26:50.040 --> 26:50.280]  Yeah.
[26:51.060 --> 26:51.900]  See what I'm saying?
[26:52.560 --> 26:53.180]  Yes, I did.
[26:54.900 --> 26:56.620]  I call it out every time I hit one.
[26:57.220 --> 26:58.620]  Oh, I'm gonna call out my ducks.
[26:58.620 --> 26:59.980]  Because I love that.
[27:00.380 --> 27:01.860]  I didn't know how many ducks I got.
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.800]  I'm not sure why you said that like it was a gotcha.
[27:04.980 --> 27:06.560]  But, like, that's pretty cool.
[27:08.860 --> 27:09.600]  What was a gotcha?
[27:10.900 --> 27:12.640]  I'm gonna call out my ducks.
[27:13.540 --> 27:13.900]  Yeah!
[27:19.020 --> 27:21.580]  You should be on the lookout for the radio as well, Nick.
[27:21.620 --> 27:22.620]  That was a good find by you.
[27:22.640 --> 27:23.400]  Yeah, that was a really good find.
[27:23.600 --> 27:27.600]  So, now I think you just knock those ducks and then you just go to that room if you can.
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.140]  Yeah.
[27:28.520 --> 27:34.020]  Help them, because if you try to explain where that radio is to them right now, they're just trying to get situated with the ducks.
[27:34.520 --> 27:36.980]  I have a feeling that that will be randomized, though.
[27:37.100 --> 27:37.480]  That location.
[27:37.480 --> 27:38.040]  You think so?
[27:38.540 --> 27:39.940]  Yeah, everything else is good.
[27:40.740 --> 27:41.600]  Oh, this is new.
[27:41.820 --> 27:42.400]  That's new.
[27:43.160 --> 27:43.920]  I like this!
[27:46.500 --> 27:47.820]  She's showing us the duck.
[27:48.600 --> 27:50.000]  You gotta hit this.
[27:50.820 --> 27:52.040]  Hello, mother dear.
[27:53.580 --> 27:54.200]  Flip that.
[27:54.840 --> 27:55.000]  Yeah.
[27:55.160 --> 27:55.340]  Why?
[27:55.340 --> 27:55.700]  Why?
[27:56.500 --> 27:57.980]  I don't know. Stop saying weird shit.
[27:58.480 --> 27:58.860]  Play with me!
[27:58.860 --> 28:00.160]  I'm just gonna have Nickisms.
[28:02.840 --> 28:04.480]  Who wants to play a game?
[28:06.320 --> 28:07.120]  Stop, we're...
[28:09.340 --> 28:10.500]  Alright, well, that...
[28:10.500 --> 28:11.800]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[28:11.920 --> 28:13.040]  Is Nick the weirdest guy?
[28:13.360 --> 28:13.520]  Yeah.
[28:13.720 --> 28:16.880]  Dude, he was the most regular guy, but here's what happens. Over time, it comes out.
[28:17.200 --> 28:17.360]  Yeah.
[28:17.460 --> 28:19.540]  There he is. Truly is Nick.
[28:20.020 --> 28:21.500]  What you gotta do is be weird up front.
[28:21.800 --> 28:22.720]  Regulation facade guy.
[28:23.100 --> 28:23.360]  Yeah.
[28:29.020 --> 28:29.600]  Alright.
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.200]  One duck down.
[28:32.820 --> 28:33.240]  Saw that.
[28:33.300 --> 28:33.820]  One for Nick.
[28:33.920 --> 28:34.180]  Nice.
[28:34.780 --> 28:35.380]  Thank you.
[28:36.780 --> 28:38.520]  It's a pretty satisfying...
[28:38.520 --> 28:39.420]  Two ducks down.
[28:39.840 --> 28:40.180]  Two ducks down.
[28:41.720 --> 28:43.020]  Three ducks down.
[28:43.800 --> 28:44.740]  Got a duck!
[28:45.220 --> 28:46.480]  Three ducks down.
[28:46.860 --> 28:48.660]  That's four ducks for us, Gavin.
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.340]  Four ducks.
[28:50.580 --> 28:51.520]  We need five.
[28:51.700 --> 28:52.700]  One more duck and we're done.
[28:52.700 --> 28:53.120]  Got it. Alright.
[28:53.820 --> 28:55.060]  No, no, I think there's six ducks.
[28:56.660 --> 28:57.200]  Run, Andrew!
[28:57.340 --> 28:59.540]  That's another duck. That's five for us, Gavin.
[28:59.880 --> 29:00.400]  Run, Andrew!
[29:01.140 --> 29:02.320]  Got it. Last duck.
[29:02.880 --> 29:03.320]  You got it?
[29:03.800 --> 29:03.980]  Yeah.
[29:04.540 --> 29:05.820]  We gotta go. We gotta get out of here.
[29:06.180 --> 29:07.080]  Alright, let's do it.
[29:07.400 --> 29:10.820]  I don't know if that's...
[29:10.820 --> 29:11.740]  Nope, there's one left, Andrew.
[29:11.780 --> 29:12.320]  Yeah, you still need...
[29:12.320 --> 29:12.800]  Oh, there's six?
[29:12.800 --> 29:13.820]  There's still one more. There's six ducks.
[29:15.780 --> 29:19.300]  Alright, if there's six ducks, we still have a duck to find, Gavin.
[29:19.900 --> 29:20.180]  Yeah.
[29:20.840 --> 29:22.100]  Still searching for duck.
[29:22.840 --> 29:25.040]  Oh, I stepped on a bunch of shit. Holy shit.
[29:25.880 --> 29:26.760]  Monster is out.
[29:26.840 --> 29:27.340]  Got it, got it.
[29:27.500 --> 29:28.600]  You got it? Alright, move.
[29:29.420 --> 29:30.420]  I was not credit to...
[29:30.420 --> 29:31.740]  I missed both fucking throws.
[29:31.960 --> 29:32.820]  Oh, come on.
[29:32.920 --> 29:34.260]  So, did you get it or not?
[29:34.580 --> 29:35.600]  No, I didn't get it.
[29:36.280 --> 29:36.920]  Where is it?
[29:37.140 --> 29:39.580]  I found a time extender.
[29:40.160 --> 29:40.460]  Cool.
[29:40.660 --> 29:40.920]  Get it.
[29:40.980 --> 29:41.460]  Watch out for the mine.
[29:42.380 --> 29:44.480]  I saw it. I got pushed into it.
[29:45.040 --> 29:45.920]  There it is.
[29:46.520 --> 29:47.300]  I got pushed into it.
[29:47.400 --> 29:48.120]  God damn it.
[29:53.370 --> 29:54.190]  Sucks, doesn't it?
[29:54.270 --> 29:56.110]  Oh, we've done them all. There's no flame.
[29:56.350 --> 29:56.910]  Oh, there's flame.
[29:56.910 --> 29:57.290]  Go back.
[29:59.590 --> 30:00.310]  Oh, shit.
[30:01.910 --> 30:02.930]  We're done. We're done.
[30:03.070 --> 30:03.770]  We haven't done it all.
[30:03.910 --> 30:04.770]  We haven't done it all.
[30:06.730 --> 30:07.390]  I'm dying.
[30:08.010 --> 30:09.590]  All I see is a bunch of flying ducks.
[30:09.590 --> 30:11.030]  I might die. I might die.
[30:11.450 --> 30:12.450]  Do you need me to get you up?
[30:12.690 --> 30:13.650]  I need you to get me up.
[30:13.750 --> 30:13.870]  Yeah.
[30:14.790 --> 30:16.810]  A thing fucking jumped out of a locker.
[30:16.930 --> 30:17.550]  Oh, for Christ's sake.
[30:17.650 --> 30:18.270]  Oh, shit.
[30:18.710 --> 30:19.350]  Excuse me, sir.
[30:21.090 --> 30:21.450]  Crawling.
[30:21.630 --> 30:21.710]  Oh!
[30:22.650 --> 30:23.930]  Nick, turn around. Come back.
[30:24.170 --> 30:25.530]  I know there's a guy right in the middle.
[30:25.730 --> 30:26.090]  There's two guys chasing him.
[30:26.090 --> 30:27.350]  Turn around. Come back.
[30:27.350 --> 30:27.570]  Oh, shit.
[30:27.950 --> 30:29.930]  I'm sorry I didn't know he was here.
[30:30.710 --> 30:32.090]  There's a reason I ran off.
[30:32.970 --> 30:35.170]  Where's this goddamn number six?
[30:35.350 --> 30:37.250]  I can never find the last duck.
[30:38.610 --> 30:40.450]  Oh, it takes ages to get you up.
[30:41.490 --> 30:41.930]  Oh, God.
[30:41.990 --> 30:45.070]  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[30:46.290 --> 30:48.690]  No, no, you dropped me.
[30:49.290 --> 30:49.490]  You dropped me.
[30:49.490 --> 30:49.590]  What?
[30:50.050 --> 30:51.190]  No way. It finished.
[30:51.790 --> 30:52.410]  It finished.
[30:52.410 --> 30:53.190]  It totally finished.
[30:53.210 --> 30:54.670]  We saw it go all the way.
[30:54.670 --> 30:56.990]  You let go at the last moment!
[30:57.430 --> 30:58.370]  I let go of nothing!
[31:01.600 --> 31:02.420]  I'm dying too!
[31:03.140 --> 31:05.080]  No! How?
[31:05.240 --> 31:08.060]  I'm getting pissed off at this final duck every time!
[31:09.640 --> 31:11.220]  Can anyone look at their watch?
[31:11.240 --> 31:13.720]  I'm about to bleed out! I'm on the stairs!
[31:14.180 --> 31:16.480]  Where's this damn duck dick, stupid duck?
[31:17.480 --> 31:19.940]  We've got five god damn ducks.
[31:20.220 --> 31:22.420]  We've had five god damn ducks for an hour.
[31:22.860 --> 31:23.140]  Thanks, Nick!
[31:24.480 --> 31:25.400]  Let's keep it held!
[31:28.040 --> 31:28.740]  Thank you!
[31:29.740 --> 31:30.100]  I'm bleeding!
[31:30.800 --> 31:31.420]  Why are you bleeding?
[31:32.140 --> 31:33.720]  I got hit with a thing.
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.280]  One duck away.
[31:35.900 --> 31:38.260]  It's the monster from Resident Evil 7, it looks like.
[31:39.100 --> 31:39.640]  I'm getting you.
[31:39.860 --> 31:41.140]  He's going to kill me.
[31:43.680 --> 31:45.560]  Unless you guys find a time extender.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.820]  Gavin's being executed.
[31:49.040 --> 31:49.660]  I found some medicine.
[31:50.300 --> 31:53.020]  I'm just looking to see if I can find a time extender anywhere.
[31:53.160 --> 31:53.720]  Oh, a document!
[31:53.720 --> 31:54.800]  You got some evidence.
[31:55.280 --> 31:58.980]  Cool, it can go with me when I die.
[32:01.760 --> 32:06.660]  I don't know what to do about this number six duck, man.
[32:06.840 --> 32:07.200]  I'm dead.
[32:07.760 --> 32:08.400]  I found it.
[32:08.760 --> 32:09.540]  You found the duck?
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.040]  Where's the duck?
[32:18.980 --> 32:22.900]  I ran over to your side in three seconds.
[32:22.900 --> 32:23.960]  I swear I wasn't.
[32:24.680 --> 32:28.080]  It was in, you know the room that we kept missing?
[32:28.340 --> 32:29.020]  It was in that room.
[32:29.400 --> 32:29.700]  What room?
[32:30.960 --> 32:33.340]  The room that Geoff, you, I threw twice and missed.
[32:33.440 --> 32:34.420]  Then you threw and missed.
[32:34.680 --> 32:36.240]  Retry. Everyone hit retry.
[32:36.580 --> 32:38.240]  I don't know what that, I guess you have to show me.
[32:38.680 --> 32:40.780]  Everyone hit retry. One person hasn't hit it.
[32:41.260 --> 32:42.420]  Somebody hit why?
[32:42.740 --> 32:43.760]  Somebody hit retry.
[32:43.960 --> 32:44.700]  Why are you?
[32:44.700 --> 32:47.700]  Somebody hit retry.
[32:48.360 --> 32:49.460]  It's a three out of four.
[32:49.460 --> 32:50.860]  Oh, there you go, he did it.
[32:51.060 --> 32:51.500]  Was it Nick?
[32:51.860 --> 32:55.480]  No, no, I was watching Nick. Nick had already hit it.
[32:56.180 --> 32:56.720]  That was on me.
[32:57.040 --> 32:59.080]  That was me that time. Holy shit.
[32:59.880 --> 33:01.520]  I didn't hit A, you gotta hit A
[33:01.520 --> 33:02.420]  and then you gotta hit Y.
[33:02.700 --> 33:03.000]  What?
[33:05.060 --> 33:06.420]  I'd hit A first, apparently.
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.700]  I don't know what to do about this six duck.
[33:09.960 --> 33:11.920]  Three, two, one.
[33:12.000 --> 33:12.960]  I found it. Bang.
[33:16.180 --> 33:17.640]  You sounded so dejected
[33:17.640 --> 33:18.600]  as you said, I found it.
[33:19.460 --> 33:21.460]  I have a really bad feeling now that the editor
[33:21.460 --> 33:23.380]  is gonna see that it was me that didn't hit Y
[33:23.380 --> 33:24.580]  the first time. Oh, probably.
[33:24.980 --> 33:26.700]  I think that's probably what's about to happen, yeah.
[33:26.920 --> 33:29.220]  I'm excited. Now that you pointed that out,
[33:29.460 --> 33:30.400]  it's very exciting.
[33:31.040 --> 33:33.260]  I mean, at first, I thought it could have been me.
[33:33.520 --> 33:35.260]  But now, I'm thinking it might have been you.
[33:36.300 --> 33:37.260]  Let's get these pods.
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.020]  These fucking ducks.
[33:39.580 --> 33:41.260]  You know, we lose two seconds in the pod.
[33:41.340 --> 33:43.540]  It's bullshit. How many ducks did you hit
[33:43.540 --> 33:44.180]  last time, Gavin?
[33:45.460 --> 33:46.460]  Three. Four.
[33:46.660 --> 33:47.280]  One. Two.
[33:48.680 --> 33:50.200]  One. No, you might have hit two.
[33:50.280 --> 33:52.040]  I hit three. I'm gonna hit four.
[33:52.900 --> 33:54.200]  Speed, speed, speed, speed.
[33:55.240 --> 33:55.720]  Alright.
[33:56.120 --> 33:58.220]  Going for ducks. Going for distance.
[33:58.880 --> 33:59.980]  Nice, Nick. Alright. Thank you.
[34:02.400 --> 34:04.140]  Okay. Three. First duck
[34:04.700 --> 34:06.320]  missed. First duck's
[34:06.320 --> 34:06.580]  down.
[34:08.120 --> 34:09.920]  Missed. Got it.
[34:10.460 --> 34:12.320]  Okay. I got a time extender. Oops.
[34:13.180 --> 34:14.060]  Second duck's down.
[34:14.140 --> 34:15.340]  Good job, Gavin. There's one right here.
[34:15.540 --> 34:16.100]  There you go, Gavin.
[34:19.620 --> 34:20.180]  I missed
[34:20.180 --> 34:21.620]  every fucking... There we go. Three.
[34:22.140 --> 34:24.040]  Alright, that's two ducks for me. One for
[34:24.040 --> 34:24.740]  Gavin.
[34:26.080 --> 34:27.520]  Go ahead and... Oh, that shit.
[34:27.900 --> 34:28.800]  I've never been in this room before.
[34:30.260 --> 34:32.080]  You've never been in this room before?
[34:32.140 --> 34:33.840]  Is that what you said? That's what he said.
[34:34.280 --> 34:35.460]  So that's four ducks, Gavin.
[34:36.620 --> 34:37.780]  Here's duck number five.
[34:38.020 --> 34:39.980]  Do we have more time than you?
[34:39.980 --> 34:41.140]  That's duck number five.
[34:41.760 --> 34:44.160]  I found a time extender. I've gotten three.
[34:44.340 --> 34:45.460]  Oh, there's another one. I see it.
[34:45.840 --> 34:47.680]  Oh, shit. Alright, Gavin. That's five ducks.
[34:47.760 --> 34:48.760]  We just have to find one more duck.
[34:50.520 --> 34:51.220]  Ghost man.
[34:53.600 --> 34:54.280]  Okay, I've got...
[34:54.280 --> 34:55.120]  Oh, he's fucking...
[34:55.560 --> 34:57.740]  I'm getting eaten. I think so. Let's go check.
[34:57.860 --> 34:59.600]  Did you guys do it? I think so.
[34:59.700 --> 35:01.400]  I think so. We did.
[35:01.580 --> 35:03.480]  You got it. You got it. Move up. We're on our way.
[35:04.900 --> 35:06.120]  On their way to you guys.
[35:06.220 --> 35:08.240]  Go help them. Alexa, shut up.
[35:08.240 --> 35:10.080]  What room we ain't been in, Geoff?
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.020]  Oh, shit. Couple of men.
[35:12.520 --> 35:13.640]  I'm in the bathroom.
[35:13.980 --> 35:14.320]  Oh, what the?
[35:16.180 --> 35:18.580]  You keep running into every trap
[35:18.580 --> 35:20.820]  and the thing comes after you.
[35:21.660 --> 35:22.300]  Hi, Gavin.
[35:22.660 --> 35:23.000]  What's up?
[35:23.340 --> 35:24.020]  Oh, shit.
[35:25.620 --> 35:26.860]  Looking for the sixth duck.
[35:27.600 --> 35:28.580]  What's up? There's men.
[35:29.800 --> 35:31.980]  Found it. Stop hurting me, hallucination.
[35:32.180 --> 35:33.780]  No, I missed. No, no. It's not it.
[35:33.860 --> 35:36.080]  It's not it. Sorry. I was getting attacked.
[35:36.080 --> 35:38.840]  You need to keep moving, man.
[35:39.420 --> 35:40.660]  You need to find the antidote.
[35:41.820 --> 35:42.240]  Yeah, I do.
[35:43.920 --> 35:44.280]  Ow!
[35:44.500 --> 35:46.100]  I got the gas. Andrew, where is it?
[35:47.060 --> 35:48.480]  No, no. He thought he got it.
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.160]  No, I was wrong. I was wrong. I was panicked.
[35:52.780 --> 35:54.420]  Ah! I did it again!
[35:54.640 --> 35:55.200]  Time extender.
[35:55.880 --> 35:58.160]  I don't even feel bad for you.
[35:58.160 --> 35:59.400]  Hey, guys. I made it upstairs.
[36:00.780 --> 36:00.860]  Yeah.
[36:03.620 --> 36:05.100]  You don't have to go to the fire.
[36:05.100 --> 36:06.260]  We can go around from the light.
[36:06.860 --> 36:09.520]  You have to stop the fire
[36:09.520 --> 36:11.260]  in order to open the door
[36:11.260 --> 36:11.980]  that you need to go to.
[36:12.640 --> 36:14.140]  That's adrenaline. It's not the same thing.
[36:14.640 --> 36:15.180]  I'm gonna take it.
[36:16.820 --> 36:18.720]  I mean, listen. If I take enough things,
[36:18.740 --> 36:20.600]  it'll overcome the thing I'm experiencing, right?
[36:20.960 --> 36:21.340]  Uh, yeah.
[36:21.960 --> 36:22.560]  Is that how drugs work?
[36:26.640 --> 36:27.000]  Fuck.
[36:28.060 --> 36:28.780]  Come on, duck.
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.580]  Where is it?
[36:30.000 --> 36:30.680]  Why am I dying?
[36:32.940 --> 36:33.340]  Why am I dying?
[36:33.340 --> 36:34.220]  Well, it's killing me.
[36:35.520 --> 36:36.680]  I'm gonna go ahead and use that.
[36:38.200 --> 36:38.600]  Hmm.
[36:38.920 --> 36:39.120]  Cool.
[36:43.470 --> 36:44.290]  Dude, what are you doing?
[36:45.710 --> 36:46.110]  Uh...
[36:46.950 --> 36:48.070]  Why am I bleeding?
[36:48.850 --> 36:50.090]  You're standing in the fire.
[36:50.490 --> 36:53.030]  I don't think I'm anymore.
[36:53.250 --> 36:54.390]  I'm gonna come back over to you guys.
[36:56.070 --> 36:58.010]  I'm gonna double-check this other room here.
[36:58.150 --> 36:58.990]  Oh, what is this?
[37:00.330 --> 37:01.050]  What does that do?
[37:01.050 --> 37:01.830]  Oh, it's a lockpick.
[37:02.250 --> 37:02.570]  Oh, nice.
[37:04.690 --> 37:06.230]  Oh, for God's sake.
[37:06.950 --> 37:07.170]  Nope.
[37:07.550 --> 37:10.510]  So if we go up these stairs and go up into the thing,
[37:10.770 --> 37:11.670]  it doesn't do us any good.
[37:11.690 --> 37:14.390]  You need to hit all the ducks to unlock the next room.
[37:15.730 --> 37:16.170]  Nice.
[37:16.170 --> 37:17.770]  Dude, it's just flat ducks.
[37:18.990 --> 37:19.810]  Rig Recharger.
[37:21.670 --> 37:22.490]  I'm glad that
[37:23.110 --> 37:24.870]  everybody's having the same amount of trouble
[37:24.870 --> 37:26.810]  we are finding this duck.
[37:27.470 --> 37:29.110]  Our sixth duck is a motherfucker.
[37:29.110 --> 37:29.950]  There you go.
[37:32.010 --> 37:33.010]  Where is that little
[37:33.010 --> 37:33.750]  son of a bitch?
[37:36.550 --> 37:37.170]  There's a duck
[37:37.170 --> 37:38.010]  that was crushed.
[37:38.670 --> 37:39.750]  So it's not gonna be in here.
[37:41.210 --> 37:41.790]  Flippin' hell.
[37:44.850 --> 37:45.070]  Ah!
[37:45.370 --> 37:45.650]  Ah!
[37:47.250 --> 37:48.270]  It's not gonna be that way.
[37:48.810 --> 37:49.670]  It's not that way.
[37:53.800 --> 37:54.160]  Uh...
[37:54.160 --> 37:55.960]  What the hell is this?
[37:55.980 --> 37:57.400]  That's where they came in from. It's not gonna be there.
[37:57.400 --> 37:59.400]  I know, I'm just making sure that it didn't...
[38:00.880 --> 38:01.280]  Oh!
[38:01.680 --> 38:02.420]  Fuckin' hell!
[38:02.980 --> 38:05.340]  Well, I mean...
[38:05.340 --> 38:07.600]  Try to outlast the Skinner, man. What the hell?
[38:08.180 --> 38:09.380]  That was happening
[38:09.380 --> 38:11.380]  to you earlier. That's the ghost
[38:11.380 --> 38:12.500]  thing that's coming after you.
[38:13.740 --> 38:15.740]  I've got an antidote if you need it.
[38:15.960 --> 38:16.420]  Oh, please!
[38:17.900 --> 38:18.400]  Where you at, son?
[38:18.800 --> 38:19.380]  The Skinner, man!
[38:21.060 --> 38:21.500]  Hi, Gavin.
[38:22.240 --> 38:23.620]  Let me give this to you.
[38:23.620 --> 38:24.180]  How?
[38:25.600 --> 38:26.500]  Full sanity.
[38:26.880 --> 38:28.660]  I can't use it on you?
[38:29.220 --> 38:31.620]  This isn't left for dead.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.060]  Leave me alone.
[38:34.300 --> 38:34.420]  Ah!
[38:36.200 --> 38:37.760]  Nick's so fucked.
[38:38.260 --> 38:39.840]  I can't wait for the editor
[38:39.840 --> 38:41.760]  to circle the duck I've walked past
[38:41.760 --> 38:42.420]  nine times.
[38:42.740 --> 38:44.380]  All of us, I'm sure, at this point.
[38:45.200 --> 38:46.580]  Geoff, that guy's smacking you around.
[38:46.820 --> 38:47.360]  I found it.
[38:48.340 --> 38:50.000]  Everyone go upstairs.
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.440]  Thank God for my psychosis.
[38:52.600 --> 38:53.720]  Turn off your thing.
[38:54.540 --> 38:55.380]  Where was it, Nick?
[38:56.120 --> 38:57.880]  It was in that room we circled
[38:57.880 --> 38:59.080]  6,000 times.
[39:00.140 --> 39:01.080]  How's our time?
[39:01.240 --> 39:01.860]  Oh, not bad.
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.640]  Watch out for the explosions.
[39:08.500 --> 39:09.880]  What are you supposed to do here?
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.160]  We gotta find the Butterman, I think.
[39:15.890 --> 39:17.350]  Can I throw a mine?
[39:17.930 --> 39:19.330]  Yes, you just need to be
[39:19.330 --> 39:20.590]  far away from it.
[39:23.070 --> 39:24.450]  Found Gooseberry's office.
[39:27.630 --> 39:29.610]  Oh, you guys need to get over to me.
[39:29.750 --> 39:31.190]  Get to me, and then we're done.
[39:31.890 --> 39:32.910]  Where are you?
[39:33.470 --> 39:34.650]  Uh, oh shit, here.
[39:35.710 --> 39:36.890]  Come back, come back, come back.
[39:37.030 --> 39:37.990]  I'm following this man.
[39:38.410 --> 39:39.490]  Oh, okay.
[39:41.930 --> 39:42.950]  Where did Andrew go?
[39:43.010 --> 39:44.030]  Where did Andrew go?
[39:44.490 --> 39:45.970]  You went to where he was.
[39:45.970 --> 39:46.990]  Where are you going?
[39:48.330 --> 39:49.550]  Everyone on me.
[39:49.930 --> 39:51.370]  Oh my god.
[39:51.410 --> 39:52.430]  Is everyone with me?
[39:53.710 --> 39:54.730]  I'm on the ground.
[39:55.050 --> 39:57.290]  Oh, he's bleeding out.
[39:57.450 --> 39:58.250]  We gotta get Geoff up.
[39:58.890 --> 40:00.750]  Go through that door, then take a left.
[40:01.530 --> 40:01.910]  What door?
[40:02.650 --> 40:04.270]  The one that I'm in.
[40:04.390 --> 40:06.130]  I thought you guys were with me.
[40:06.630 --> 40:07.250]  Am I good, Andrew?
[40:08.370 --> 40:10.090]  I'm trying to pick you up, Geoff.
[40:10.490 --> 40:11.410]  30 seconds!
[40:12.150 --> 40:12.630]  Oh!
[40:13.290 --> 40:14.470]  No, I bled out!
[40:15.410 --> 40:16.630]  I gotta get you, Andrew.
[40:17.430 --> 40:19.350]  Crawl! Geoff, crawl through the door.
[40:19.770 --> 40:21.990]  I can't move. I'm being helped by teammate Gavin.
[40:22.490 --> 40:23.430]  Do you not want to be helped?
[40:24.470 --> 40:25.030]  Yeah, I do.
[40:25.370 --> 40:27.710]  Go! Maybe there's a time extender I can find.
[40:28.110 --> 40:28.470]  Go!
[40:29.690 --> 40:31.410]  It's just through here?
[40:32.350 --> 40:32.770]  Up here?
[40:33.410 --> 40:34.370]  6 seconds!
[40:34.850 --> 40:35.870]  Turn around, Nick!
[40:36.430 --> 40:38.110]  Oh, he's not gonna get there.
[40:38.110 --> 40:38.810]  He's not gonna get there.
[40:41.110 --> 40:41.630]  I...
[40:43.970 --> 40:45.330]  We can do this.
[40:45.650 --> 40:46.810]  We got this.
[40:47.170 --> 40:49.270]  Here's something I just want to point out.
[40:50.530 --> 40:51.930]  When the person says,
[40:52.270 --> 40:53.910]  on me, and then starts running
[40:53.910 --> 40:55.950]  room to room, it's hard to get
[40:55.950 --> 40:56.710]  to them.
[40:57.110 --> 40:59.470]  I ran, and I was with all of you,
[40:59.590 --> 41:00.910]  and I said, follow me.
[41:01.190 --> 41:02.770]  I was inside your asshole then.
[41:02.970 --> 41:04.710]  I was in the office.
[41:05.730 --> 41:06.930]  Now, before that,
[41:07.310 --> 41:08.570]  none of us knew where we were going.
[41:08.790 --> 41:10.270]  So I was just saying, hey, I figured it out.
[41:10.450 --> 41:12.430]  Then I ran back to where I was,
[41:13.170 --> 41:14.950]  and then, unfortunately, Geoff died.
[41:15.510 --> 41:16.850]  Well, you don't know where you're going
[41:16.850 --> 41:18.470]  until you know where you've been, Andrew.
[41:18.650 --> 41:18.990]  Exactly!
[41:20.110 --> 41:21.970]  I'm just saying, I don't think we did anything wrong there.
[41:22.310 --> 41:22.450]  No.
[41:25.750 --> 41:27.130]  It does concern me that
[41:27.130 --> 41:28.110]  Nick found the duck.
[41:28.270 --> 41:29.430]  We could have found the duck sooner.
[41:30.590 --> 41:31.970]  Yeah, but we found like,
[41:31.970 --> 41:33.750]  four time extenders, at least.
[41:34.730 --> 41:36.510]  Oh, Nick found so many time extenders.
[41:37.090 --> 41:37.930]  You got it.
[41:37.990 --> 41:39.190]  I feel good about this one.
[41:39.830 --> 41:41.470]  I feel great about it.
[41:46.750 --> 41:47.790]  I'm feeling...
[41:47.790 --> 41:48.890]  I'm okay.
[41:50.610 --> 41:51.530]  Six ducks.
[41:53.890 --> 41:55.310]  In my tube.
[41:56.050 --> 41:57.710]  There's a lot of tubage in this game.
[41:57.850 --> 41:59.550]  Yeah, a lot of tubage.
[42:00.690 --> 42:01.750]  There's a tube
[42:01.750 --> 42:02.730]  in my butt.
[42:05.790 --> 42:06.230]  Okay.
[42:12.610 --> 42:14.510]  Alright, grab those hearts. Let's do this thing, baby.
[42:14.750 --> 42:15.690]  I got gassed.
[42:16.210 --> 42:16.910]  One duck.
[42:17.710 --> 42:18.590]  One duck.
[42:20.530 --> 42:21.410]  Two ducks.
[42:25.470 --> 42:26.430]  Alright, three ducks.
[42:26.530 --> 42:27.910]  I'm going back. I see another one.
[42:28.210 --> 42:28.750]  Two ducks.
[42:30.330 --> 42:32.530]  So I've hit two. You've hit one, Andrew.
[42:32.970 --> 42:34.090]  Yeah. Hit a duck.
[42:36.150 --> 42:37.350]  I've hit a third one.
[42:37.690 --> 42:38.490]  Three ducks.
[42:39.210 --> 42:40.450]  Five ducks now.
[42:41.970 --> 42:42.690]  Four ducks.
[42:43.370 --> 42:44.530]  That's five for us, Gavin.
[42:44.650 --> 42:46.550]  You just need to find one more duck, buddy.
[42:47.670 --> 42:48.350]  I will in a second.
[42:48.450 --> 42:49.930]  I just want to see if it's up there.
[42:50.670 --> 42:52.270]  There it is. Got him.
[42:52.410 --> 42:52.730]  We're done.
[42:53.590 --> 42:55.690]  Oh, I hear a radio. Hold on.
[42:56.870 --> 42:57.350]  Got it.
[43:01.170 --> 43:01.530]  God.
[43:02.330 --> 43:02.930]  Alright, Gavin.
[43:03.010 --> 43:04.650]  Just need you to find one other duck.
[43:05.490 --> 43:06.590]  Come on. You can do it.
[43:07.210 --> 43:08.910]  You scared the shit out of me.
[43:09.290 --> 43:11.630]  Gavin, I'm getting eaten. If you could stop that from happening.
[43:12.190 --> 43:13.470]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[43:15.550 --> 43:16.870]  Eat foot, you prick.
[43:18.410 --> 43:19.870]  Oh, it's getting real...
[43:19.870 --> 43:21.870]  Oh, Christ almighty, Gav.
[43:21.890 --> 43:22.430]  I'm dying.
[43:23.590 --> 43:24.290]  I'm bleeding out.
[43:25.510 --> 43:26.530]  You're already down, down?
[43:26.810 --> 43:29.510]  I just walked out the door and the guy hit me with a sledgehammer.
[43:29.510 --> 43:31.610]  Okay, I'm coming for you.
[43:32.130 --> 43:32.610]  Okay.
[43:32.870 --> 43:34.590]  Maybe I'll get that health gun.
[43:35.210 --> 43:37.690]  I have found four ducks already, though.
[43:38.110 --> 43:39.130]  That's pretty damn good.
[43:39.310 --> 43:40.250]  Just need one more.
[43:42.510 --> 43:44.570]  Hey, Nick, could you check the area that you did last time?
[43:45.010 --> 43:45.190]  Yep.
[43:45.950 --> 43:46.370]  God damn it.
[43:51.140 --> 43:53.280]  This isn't a health gun, apparently.
[43:54.300 --> 43:55.400]  Keep looking, keep looking.
[43:56.560 --> 43:58.180]  It was right over here.
[43:58.600 --> 44:00.240]  Go in there, Nick.
[44:00.240 --> 44:00.880]  In here?
[44:01.440 --> 44:02.720]  Yeah, and then look up in a corner.
[44:03.920 --> 44:06.120]  I got the last duck, it's over here.
[44:06.320 --> 44:07.260]  You got it?
[44:07.300 --> 44:08.900]  No, I know where it is.
[44:09.700 --> 44:11.060]  Stay still, stay still.
[44:12.380 --> 44:14.340]  It's under me, above me.
[44:14.540 --> 44:15.180]  Got it.
[44:15.680 --> 44:16.840]  Let's go upstairs.
[44:17.360 --> 44:17.860]  Everyone up.
[44:21.100 --> 44:22.920]  I'm gonna need some health at some point.
[44:23.780 --> 44:24.560]  We may not.
[44:24.580 --> 44:25.640]  I got an adrenaline shot.
[44:26.220 --> 44:27.000]  Uh, okay.
[44:27.340 --> 44:27.860]  Drop it.
[44:29.380 --> 44:30.680]  What does the syringe do?
[44:31.440 --> 44:33.280]  I think it immediately gets somebody up.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.620]  I tried to do that on Geoff.
[44:35.080 --> 44:35.580]  Oh, shit.
[44:35.940 --> 44:37.740]  I kicked him off of you.
[44:38.300 --> 44:39.340]  Use your night vision, Nick.
[44:41.220 --> 44:41.800]  Oh, balls.
[44:42.260 --> 44:43.300]  Oh, this way.
[44:43.480 --> 44:44.440]  Oh, what the hell?
[44:46.160 --> 44:46.880]  What happened?
[44:48.080 --> 44:50.620]  Yeah, there you go, there you go.
[44:50.740 --> 44:51.980]  We're on our way to Gooseberry's office.
[44:52.840 --> 44:54.060]  I'm up, I'm here.
[44:54.120 --> 44:55.280]  Up, up, up.
[44:56.460 --> 44:58.540]  We're here, we're here.
[44:58.780 --> 44:59.780]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[45:00.320 --> 45:01.420]  I'm here, press X.
[45:02.500 --> 45:02.960]  Yeah!
[45:04.580 --> 45:06.120]  Easy, first try.
[45:08.140 --> 45:09.380]  Fuck you, Futterman.
[45:09.800 --> 45:10.340]  Are you alright?
[45:11.400 --> 45:12.120]  Wait, what?
[45:13.100 --> 45:14.120]  Oh, it's a person in there.
[45:14.820 --> 45:16.080]  It's gonna hit him in the spine.
[45:17.960 --> 45:19.400]  Oh, I hate it.
[45:19.400 --> 45:19.740]  Yeah!
[45:24.120 --> 45:24.920]  That's disturbing.
[45:25.940 --> 45:26.740]  Yeah, gross.
[45:28.220 --> 45:29.520]  You did all that for that?
[45:29.780 --> 45:31.120]  Are we the real monsters?
[45:31.800 --> 45:32.580]  I think we might be.
[45:33.960 --> 45:35.200]  Getting the fuck out of here.
[45:36.240 --> 45:37.500]  Are we still on a time limit?
[45:37.760 --> 45:38.060]  Yeah.
[45:39.120 --> 45:40.700]  Was it an us or him situation?
[45:41.760 --> 45:43.080]  I think so, yeah.
[45:44.140 --> 45:45.660]  Yeah, you're definitely still on a time limit.
[45:45.900 --> 45:46.340]  Thanks, guys.
[45:47.600 --> 45:48.080]  Welcome.
[45:48.660 --> 45:49.780]  Oops, now where?
[45:51.100 --> 45:52.180]  Gotta find the exit.
[45:53.260 --> 45:55.120]  That's not a time extender, is it?
[45:55.340 --> 45:55.480]  No.
[46:00.200 --> 46:00.620]  Exit!
[46:00.860 --> 46:01.120]  On me!
[46:02.640 --> 46:03.340]  There you go.
[46:06.800 --> 46:07.120]  Parkour!
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.660]  This way, maybe?
[46:11.340 --> 46:12.160]  What did the sign say?
[46:12.540 --> 46:14.100]  I didn't see it.
[46:14.140 --> 46:14.960]  It said Canal A.
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.380]  A minute left or something.
[46:21.640 --> 46:22.120]  Someone's yelling.
[46:23.920 --> 46:25.780]  I am up Andrew's asshole.
[46:25.860 --> 46:25.980]  Wait, what?
[46:27.380 --> 46:28.460]  Is this back where we started?
[46:31.640 --> 46:32.520]  Someone's yelling.
[46:33.660 --> 46:35.520]  There's some shit happening in my brain.
[46:35.760 --> 46:36.020]  Shit!
[46:36.760 --> 46:37.520]  This is a circle.
[46:38.920 --> 46:40.860]  You guys need to stick together, though.
[46:40.900 --> 46:42.740]  I think you're doing the right thing by sticking together.
[46:43.500 --> 46:44.940]  I'm going back the way we came.
[46:45.180 --> 46:46.360]  On the exit.
[46:47.400 --> 46:48.260]  I'm bleeding.
[46:48.400 --> 46:51.020]  Are we supposed to go back where we came in from?
[46:51.460 --> 46:52.300]  There's a canal.
[46:52.720 --> 46:53.720]  30 seconds.
[46:53.820 --> 46:54.220]  Ow.
[46:56.180 --> 46:57.260]  Not through there.
[46:57.660 --> 46:59.660]  Canal A?
[47:00.560 --> 47:01.940]  I don't think I'm going to make it.
[47:02.940 --> 47:03.240]  Maybe.
[47:04.020 --> 47:04.400]  Keep going.
[47:04.540 --> 47:10.000]  Oh, it's open.
[47:10.820 --> 47:11.920]  Okay, so we just need to get...
[47:15.020 --> 47:15.560]  Ow!
[47:15.560 --> 47:16.740]  Wait for the shuttle.
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.100]  Oh my god.
[47:19.540 --> 47:20.600]  It's the crazy lady.
[47:22.120 --> 47:22.860]  Ah, shit.
[47:26.060 --> 47:26.500]  Alright.
[47:28.680 --> 47:30.200]  Oh, we just got the exit.
[47:30.380 --> 47:31.080]  The trial thing.
[47:31.220 --> 47:31.960]  It just arrived.
[47:32.340 --> 47:34.440]  Way to go, guys. You beat it.
[47:35.200 --> 47:36.040]  Yay, we did it.
[47:36.600 --> 47:37.280]  We killed a man.
[47:39.540 --> 47:40.900]  Do you want to try one more run?
[47:41.280 --> 47:42.340]  See if we can escape it?
[47:43.020 --> 47:43.420]  Sure.
[47:44.360 --> 47:45.480]  Everybody sounds super excited.
[47:48.980 --> 47:50.460]  So where did we go wrong
[47:50.460 --> 47:51.220]  on the way out there?
[47:51.860 --> 47:54.240]  You needed to go through the door that Nick opened that said
[47:54.240 --> 47:55.040]  Canal A.
[47:55.620 --> 47:58.360]  The other way will take you back in a big circle.
[47:58.560 --> 48:00.500]  Canal A is back where it all starts.
[48:01.060 --> 48:02.300]  Then you go through
[48:02.300 --> 48:04.160]  to where, like, you enter
[48:04.160 --> 48:06.740]  here, and you hit the button to get the shuttle back.
[48:07.560 --> 48:08.140]  And then that
[48:08.140 --> 48:09.940]  crazy lady with the duck
[48:09.940 --> 48:11.960]  puppet is waiting for us at the exit.
[48:13.640 --> 48:14.100]  I feel
[48:14.100 --> 48:15.800]  really good about our duckage.
[48:17.240 --> 48:17.360]  Yeah.
[48:17.840 --> 48:20.180]  I feel good about finding time extenders.
[48:22.200 --> 48:24.020]  We all know kind of what to look for
[48:24.020 --> 48:25.460]  for Gooseberry's office.
[48:28.320 --> 48:29.580]  Let's do this.
[48:39.220 --> 48:40.000]  Hopping left.
[48:51.160 --> 48:51.680]  Alright.
[48:52.300 --> 48:53.000]  One duck down.
[48:55.260 --> 48:56.640]  Two ducks down.
[48:58.120 --> 48:58.960]  Three ducks down.
[48:59.660 --> 49:01.040]  Two ducks down.
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.040]  Man, you guys are duck machines.
[49:03.240 --> 49:04.320]  Three ducks down.
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.220]  That's on me.
[49:08.540 --> 49:09.220]  Ah, fuck. I got a
[49:09.220 --> 49:10.480]  duck, but not a heart.
[49:10.920 --> 49:11.960]  Ah, shit!
[49:14.980 --> 49:16.240]  Come on, Nick.
[49:16.240 --> 49:17.200]  Got it.
[49:17.280 --> 49:18.840]  Nick got the last one.
[49:19.780 --> 49:20.900]  Every time!
[49:21.260 --> 49:23.780]  Four ducks for me, one for Gavin.
[49:25.020 --> 49:26.000]  Got another duck.
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.260]  I think that's all six, isn't it?
[49:28.520 --> 49:29.260]  That's six for us.
[49:29.420 --> 49:30.980]  Not you.
[49:32.120 --> 49:33.380]  Toilet Geoff, Eric!
[49:35.440 --> 49:36.180]  Yeah, we're clear
[49:36.180 --> 49:36.840]  on our side.
[49:37.520 --> 49:38.860]  Oh, balls.
[49:39.380 --> 49:40.640]  Just run.
[49:41.020 --> 49:42.840]  They can't go up these stairs.
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.760]  Alright, that's it for us.
[49:48.740 --> 49:50.480]  Don't go that way. Stop going that way.
[49:50.480 --> 49:51.780]  I saw it.
[49:52.260 --> 49:54.480]  Stop going this way.
[49:55.660 --> 49:56.720]  Go over the thing!
[49:56.940 --> 49:57.340]  Damn you.
[49:59.300 --> 50:00.580]  Ow. Ow.
[50:01.280 --> 50:03.200]  All that work and you went into the belly.
[50:03.540 --> 50:04.720]  I didn't go into it.
[50:04.760 --> 50:05.920]  I was pushed into it.
[50:07.140 --> 50:08.180]  There's a difference.
[50:11.840 --> 50:13.000]  Geoff's on the floor.
[50:14.800 --> 50:15.560]  I'm getting...
[50:15.560 --> 50:16.440]  attacked by something.
[50:16.820 --> 50:18.460]  Am I helping you or hurting you?
[50:18.580 --> 50:19.380]  Oh, Jesus!
[50:21.780 --> 50:23.680]  Just like I was strangling you.
[50:27.620 --> 50:28.280]  Gooseberry's office.
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.260]  You guys are going to it.
[50:30.720 --> 50:30.840]  Yeah.
[50:32.080 --> 50:33.340]  We can get a time extender.
[50:33.640 --> 50:35.980]  Oh, I have full sanity now, apparently.
[50:36.140 --> 50:36.940]  Alright, you want me to press the button?
[50:37.760 --> 50:38.520]  Hit it.
[50:38.520 --> 50:39.640]  Alright, we don't have to watch.
[50:39.740 --> 50:41.700]  You don't have to watch. Go upstairs.
[50:41.920 --> 50:42.400]  Let's go.
[50:43.320 --> 50:44.480]  The stairs is locked.
[50:46.900 --> 50:47.880]  It'll take a second.
[50:48.180 --> 50:50.380]  But then you'll find that door
[50:50.380 --> 50:51.520]  that said Canal A.
[50:53.200 --> 50:54.540]  I see a time extender
[50:54.540 --> 50:55.660]  right on the other side as well.
[50:56.300 --> 50:56.840]  Look at me.
[50:58.620 --> 50:59.400]  Oh, shit!
[50:59.840 --> 51:00.720]  My face!
[51:02.100 --> 51:03.360]  Can you go through those doors yet?
[51:04.200 --> 51:04.460]  Yep.
[51:04.460 --> 51:04.780]  Go.
[51:05.960 --> 51:07.420]  Alright, which way should we stick together?
[51:07.480 --> 51:07.780]  Time extender.
[51:10.200 --> 51:11.640]  Let's go left. Open this up.
[51:11.680 --> 51:12.820]  Go through the garage here.
[51:13.000 --> 51:13.740]  Oh, right. The garage?
[51:14.080 --> 51:14.240]  Yeah.
[51:17.720 --> 51:19.380]  Did you just goo us again?
[51:20.540 --> 51:22.060]  Is everyone going under or what?
[51:22.120 --> 51:22.400]  I'm under.
[51:24.200 --> 51:24.940]  Where to now?
[51:26.260 --> 51:27.900]  I just wanted this other time extender.
[51:28.900 --> 51:30.160]  Through here. On me.
[51:31.060 --> 51:31.220]  Okay.
[51:32.440 --> 51:32.880]  Okay.
[51:33.040 --> 51:34.320]  That wasn't great.
[51:34.480 --> 51:35.400]  What happened?
[51:35.800 --> 51:36.500]  I need help.
[51:38.240 --> 51:39.840]  What were you doing down there?
[51:40.340 --> 51:42.360]  I opened a door and a thing shot out at me.
[51:42.520 --> 51:43.640]  Another time extender.
[51:45.120 --> 51:46.220]  Extend the bomb.
[51:47.360 --> 51:48.940]  Okay, we got so much time.
[51:49.160 --> 51:50.260]  Oh, there it is!
[51:50.560 --> 51:51.660]  On me!
[51:53.140 --> 51:53.920]  Okay, going to Nick.
[51:55.280 --> 51:56.400]  There's another time extender.
[51:56.640 --> 51:58.080]  Oh, shit! And you guys are being followed.
[51:58.080 --> 51:58.700]  Oh, there you go.
[51:58.960 --> 51:59.920]  Run, run, run.
[52:01.480 --> 52:02.360]  Canal A.
[52:04.920 --> 52:05.820]  Follow me to the canal.
[52:06.080 --> 52:06.400]  Through here.
[52:07.680 --> 52:08.980]  Go over this way.
[52:11.260 --> 52:12.900]  Keep going all the way through there.
[52:13.180 --> 52:14.260]  And then to the right.
[52:14.320 --> 52:14.720]  Hit the button.
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.780]  We just got to wait for the shuttle.
[52:18.040 --> 52:19.460]  Be careful.
[52:20.080 --> 52:21.800]  Nick, do you have the pocket knife thing still?
[52:22.720 --> 52:23.560]  It's a lockpick.
[52:24.360 --> 52:24.800]  Guys!
[52:24.800 --> 52:26.800]  Oh, God!
[52:27.820 --> 52:28.460]  It's in!
[52:29.440 --> 52:30.480]  Everyone out!
[52:31.640 --> 52:32.660]  Gavin, get in the pod!
[52:32.880 --> 52:33.860]  Gavin, get in!
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.140]  We did it!
[52:36.560 --> 52:37.740]  Oh, my God.
[52:38.120 --> 52:39.540]  We did it!
[52:40.880 --> 52:41.400]  Yeah!
[52:43.040 --> 52:44.800]  I got an A-!
[52:45.460 --> 52:46.480]  I got an A-!
[52:46.480 --> 52:48.640]  For the first time in my life, I got an A!
[52:48.960 --> 52:50.960]  You did better than everyone else, too.
[52:51.160 --> 52:51.420]  Wow.
[52:51.420 --> 52:51.640]  Woo!
[52:53.460 --> 52:53.980]  Oh!
[52:54.620 --> 52:56.460]  Was that for all the duckage?
[52:56.940 --> 52:58.360]  That's all the duckage.
[52:58.780 --> 53:00.360]  Oh, my God.
[53:01.240 --> 53:04.020]  Well, thank you so much for watching this Let's Play.
[53:04.840 --> 53:06.920]  We will have more of those.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.040]  They come out every week.
[53:08.540 --> 53:10.480]  We have a Patreon, the Regulation Pod.
[53:10.800 --> 53:13.820]  Check out Geoff.Sucks.
[53:13.920 --> 53:15.720]  I think that also redirects to the Patreon.
[53:16.460 --> 53:17.680]  You have a lot of options.
[53:18.240 --> 53:19.520]  Thank you so much for watching.
[53:19.520 --> 53:21.980]  Go to Kindle Unlimited and buy our smut book,
[53:23.120 --> 53:25.360]  Celestial Glorbosis of Peace and Poimals,
[53:25.440 --> 53:26.160]  available now.
[53:26.460 --> 53:27.560]  Climbing up the charts
[53:27.560 --> 53:31.440]  of the erotic sci-fi fiction section of Amazon.
[53:32.020 --> 53:33.300]  I think it's all the way back down now.
[53:34.140 --> 53:35.060]  Plummeting down the charts.
[53:35.480 --> 53:38.040]  Hey, it may be different for you guys,
[53:38.120 --> 53:39.380]  but for me, I'm completely
[53:39.380 --> 53:40.960]  and totally pristinely clean,
[53:41.120 --> 53:43.040]  and you guys are covered in blood.
[53:43.540 --> 53:45.440]  Oh, yeah. Geoff is very, very clean.
[53:45.620 --> 53:45.980]  That's funny.
[53:45.980 --> 53:46.760]  That's why he's an A.
[53:48.560 --> 53:49.020]  Bye!
