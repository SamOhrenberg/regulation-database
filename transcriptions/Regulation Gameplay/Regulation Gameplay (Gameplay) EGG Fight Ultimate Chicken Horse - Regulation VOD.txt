[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  That's a big logo.
[00:02.000 --> 00:02.980]  Yeah, that's good, right?
[00:03.920 --> 00:05.020]  We're a big company, Gavin.
[00:05.600 --> 00:07.960]  Do you not like the logo? Or was that
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.940]  just you saying that that was what it
[00:09.940 --> 00:11.820]  looked like? It's just very zoomed in.
[00:12.740 --> 00:13.640]  It's very big.
[00:14.940 --> 00:15.920]  Do you want it to be smaller?
[00:15.920 --> 00:16.860]  It's bigger than you think of it.
[00:17.280 --> 00:19.500]  What do you want it to look like? No, it's perfect.
[00:20.040 --> 00:21.900]  Are you sure? There's no question about what
[00:21.900 --> 00:23.980]  we're watching. Do you want me to make it
[00:23.980 --> 00:26.060]  smaller? No. He didn't say it's a
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.800]  perfect logo, he said it's a big logo.
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.800]  Yeah, you didn't say anything about it being perfect.
[00:30.120 --> 00:31.840]  It just seemed like you were being critical of
[00:31.840 --> 00:33.880]  the logo size. Big Mac's not called the perfect
[00:33.880 --> 00:35.000]  Mac, but I'll still eat it.
[00:37.400 --> 00:37.800]  Guys,
[00:37.980 --> 00:39.880]  welcome to the Friday stream and we're playing
[00:39.880 --> 00:41.700]  Ultimate Chicken Horse, baby.
[00:42.100 --> 00:43.620]  It's the perfect Mac.
[00:43.800 --> 00:45.500]  We're getting our way to 501.
[00:45.700 --> 00:47.700]  How's everyone doing? It's egg.
[00:48.100 --> 00:49.380]  Eric, Gavin, and Geoff.
[00:49.800 --> 00:51.400]  Help the egg get to 501.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.360]  Do not... It's egg time.
[00:53.620 --> 00:56.060]  Do not fuck with Gavin today. He is on it.
[00:56.940 --> 00:57.520]  He's quick.
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.120]  Yeah, no, you're fast today.
[01:00.120 --> 01:00.920]  It's good. I like that.
[01:02.560 --> 01:03.960]  You've been real stupid lately, so
[01:03.960 --> 01:05.380]  it's good to see. We had to put this together
[01:05.380 --> 01:07.880]  in a pinch. How does everything sound?
[01:07.980 --> 01:09.820]  What needs to be louder? What needs to be quieter?
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.460]  I can make some adjustments right now.
[01:11.480 --> 01:13.760]  For about three minutes and then he's not going to
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.300]  listen to anything you say from here on out. Yep.
[01:15.620 --> 01:18.140]  Absolutely. Game audio too loud? It turned it way down, baby.
[01:19.840 --> 01:20.200]  Now
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.340]  we should be good. I hope that's a problem.
[01:22.500 --> 01:24.260]  You can hear Geoff talking at this level.
[01:24.260 --> 01:25.960]  You guys are probably happy with that.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.760]  And Gavin, he's going to talk about Gavin level.
[01:28.180 --> 01:29.060]  Yeah, about his level.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.400]  What are you eating?
[01:31.940 --> 01:32.380]  Nothing.
[01:34.060 --> 01:34.500]  Okay.
[01:36.180 --> 01:38.100]  Are you eating teriyaki chicken?
[01:39.300 --> 01:39.520]  Okay.
[01:39.680 --> 01:40.860]  Yeah, that was my last bite of chicken.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.380]  That was your last bite?
[01:44.720 --> 01:45.320]  Finished at 401.
[01:46.540 --> 01:48.200]  401? An hour
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.860]  away from the perfect time? Yep.
[01:50.560 --> 01:52.420]  Dang. I had a whatchamacallit
[01:52.420 --> 01:53.740]  bar to get ready for this
[01:54.440 --> 01:56.000]  live stream and I got to be honest,
[01:56.040 --> 01:57.800]  not as good as I remembered it.
[01:57.840 --> 02:00.340]  Oh, no? No. Doesn't hold up. That sucks.
[02:00.560 --> 02:01.340]  Yeah, I was bummed. Dang.
[02:02.140 --> 02:02.340]  Okay.
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.960]  It said Eric's the quietest
[02:05.960 --> 02:08.200]  and now I've turned my stuff up
[02:08.200 --> 02:10.020]  so now you have to wait about 30 seconds before
[02:10.020 --> 02:10.920]  anyone says anything.
[02:11.200 --> 02:14.040]  You know that it's time to move on when people
[02:14.040 --> 02:16.200]  start making jokes about the audio. Eric's
[02:16.200 --> 02:17.500]  too quiet. Okay, cool. I fixed it.
[02:17.820 --> 02:19.920]  Gracie's too quiet. Andrew's too quiet. Okay, that means
[02:19.920 --> 02:21.240]  it's time to play the game.
[02:21.800 --> 02:23.460]  Alright, here we go. Gavin, start us off.
[02:24.060 --> 02:25.420]  Where do we want to go? Wherever.
[02:25.880 --> 02:26.860]  In the backrooms.
[02:27.420 --> 02:29.580]  What? Where are you guys?
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.580]  Party host starting game.
[02:31.840 --> 02:33.180]  Which one did you go to?
[02:33.420 --> 02:35.300]  Just hop on a level and it'll vote. It'll just pick.
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.520]  Yeah, but I want to play the level you want to play, dude.
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.740]  Yeah, I want to play where you want to play.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.840]  I'm up on a nuclear plant.
[02:41.240 --> 02:43.540]  Nuclear plant it is. I don't know if I can get up there.
[02:43.940 --> 02:44.800]  It's a long way. Uh oh.
[02:46.560 --> 02:47.180]  Okay, I made it.
[02:47.180 --> 02:48.820]  Okay, we made it. I made it.
[02:48.820 --> 02:51.500]  Close enough. Have you played this one before, Gavin?
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.220]  Yeah, but I'm hoping...
[02:53.220 --> 02:55.420]  Oh, nice crown. I'm hoping that in that box
[02:55.420 --> 02:58.160]  there is an unlock for another level.
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.340]  Oh, that'd be nice.
[02:59.400 --> 02:59.640]  Good idea.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.620]  Okay, we're starting.
[03:02.180 --> 03:04.180]  I'm going to go...
[03:05.640 --> 03:06.340]  Okay.
[03:08.220 --> 03:09.960]  Oh, this goes up. Interesting.
[03:10.220 --> 03:10.700]  Easy peasy.
[03:12.900 --> 03:13.460]  Yeah, way to go, Geoff.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.400]  Oh, what happened to Geoff?
[03:16.040 --> 03:17.100]  He got crushed.
[03:17.580 --> 03:18.500]  God damn it.
[03:18.900 --> 03:19.880]  Oh, a hippo. What?
[03:20.720 --> 03:22.800]  A hippo? You can play as a hippo?
[03:22.900 --> 03:24.460]  Did I know that? That's cool.
[03:24.820 --> 03:25.960]  Did I know that?
[03:28.020 --> 03:29.400]  Somebody's getting points in this one.
[03:30.020 --> 03:30.760]  It's me, baby.
[03:31.820 --> 03:32.700]  Big dance.
[03:32.880 --> 03:34.360]  Did I get first? Yes.
[03:35.420 --> 03:37.240]  Good. You're welcome.
[03:37.860 --> 03:39.540]  After this one, I'll turn on bunsing.
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.600]  Oh, bunsing's off.
[03:50.500 --> 03:51.140]  Oh, shit.
[03:52.440 --> 03:54.400]  Oh, no. Uh-oh.
[03:54.900 --> 03:55.400]  Oh, no.
[03:56.100 --> 03:57.100]  Oh, boy, that was close.
[03:58.180 --> 03:58.580]  Goodness.
[03:59.120 --> 04:00.860]  Tricked him. Oh, damn, I thought I tricked him.
[04:02.560 --> 04:03.600]  Race for first.
[04:04.180 --> 04:05.180]  What? Bye, losers.
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  Geoff, stop him.
[04:07.840 --> 04:09.020]  Oh, no points.
[04:09.740 --> 04:10.140]  Raccoon.
[04:11.120 --> 04:12.900]  I don't know what happened. I almost fell.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.020]  That would be terrible.
[04:16.660 --> 04:18.260]  There we go. Raccoon wins, baby.
[04:18.260 --> 04:21.140]  I don't think I've ever seen them play with just three people.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.580]  I don't think I have either.
[04:23.100 --> 04:26.060]  I played with Michael on his own once.
[04:26.360 --> 04:26.620]  Damn it.
[04:26.660 --> 04:27.080]  How was that?
[04:28.020 --> 04:30.060]  It was the very first chicken horse video we did.
[04:30.160 --> 04:31.820]  I think it was the plate house. It was fine.
[04:33.900 --> 04:35.140]  A little bit of plate hole.
[04:36.200 --> 04:36.800]  Plate hole?
[04:37.460 --> 04:37.900]  Plate hole.
[04:37.900 --> 04:39.140]  How come you guys don't do that anymore?
[04:42.560 --> 04:45.020]  When does this company become the other company?
[04:45.160 --> 04:46.140]  Put all company together.
[04:47.320 --> 04:49.720]  I really liked when you guys would do plate house together.
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.840]  You didn't like it when we started it.
[04:52.300 --> 04:53.160]  No, I didn't.
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.500]  Did you die?
[04:54.600 --> 04:55.140]  I fell again.
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.460]  Why didn't you like it when they started it?
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.440]  We had to fight for it.
[05:00.120 --> 05:02.020]  I don't remember. I had a reason, I'm sure.
[05:02.460 --> 05:05.600]  It was because it was replacing Rage Quit for every other week.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.200]  Oh, that's what it was.
[05:08.940 --> 05:11.060]  We did it so that Michael didn't want to die.
[05:11.740 --> 05:13.100]  Yeah, he hated doing Rage Quit.
[05:14.580 --> 05:15.280]  Is that right?
[05:15.280 --> 05:17.840]  He hated doing that thing that he created to get his foot in the door.
[05:19.140 --> 05:21.620]  Yeah, I think that's kind of how the company ended up going, man.
[05:21.620 --> 05:22.480]  Just in general.
[05:24.860 --> 05:27.100]  I think what you're describing is most of it.
[05:27.220 --> 05:27.460]  Yeah.
[05:30.180 --> 05:31.180]  I'm getting devious.
[05:31.980 --> 05:33.540]  I'm getting deceptive.
[05:36.900 --> 05:38.840]  How ugly is this here?
[05:39.420 --> 05:40.020]  Pretty ugly.
[05:40.120 --> 05:40.720]  Normal ugly.
[05:41.480 --> 05:41.880]  Oops.
[05:42.020 --> 05:44.360]  Hold on.
[05:46.980 --> 05:48.760]  Raise your monyehas.
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.260]  Why did I fall?
[05:51.460 --> 05:53.560]  Dude, that rocked. That was cool.
[05:54.020 --> 05:55.340]  I did it again.
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.460]  Come on, Gavin. Hurry up.
[05:58.280 --> 05:58.600]  Whoops.
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.040]  I forgot all the shit was up here.
[06:00.120 --> 06:02.340]  I magooed through that by accident.
[06:07.820 --> 06:09.960]  Meg Hunter of Artemis wants to know
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.240]  how long we've been streaming for.
[06:11.240 --> 06:13.140]  I think the first time I streamed
[06:13.140 --> 06:14.440]  was with Jack.
[06:15.840 --> 06:19.160]  We're on hour 61
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.180]  of our
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.640]  non-stop sub stream.
[06:22.760 --> 06:24.320]  Thank you so much.
[06:24.980 --> 06:26.800]  Can't stop, won't stop.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.760]  It was just in TV when we started.
[06:29.400 --> 06:29.600]  Yeah.
[06:33.040 --> 06:34.040]  Easy as that.
[06:34.660 --> 06:35.960]  Thanks everyone gifting subs.
[06:36.080 --> 06:38.480]  Thanks everyone who's in the chat watching us on this Friday.
[06:38.480 --> 06:40.620]  Yeah, we'd really love to be here on a Friday.
[06:41.020 --> 06:41.680]  Oh no.
[06:42.140 --> 06:43.380]  Some of us more than others.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.840]  My contraption nearly got you.
[06:45.940 --> 06:47.360]  Your contraption?
[06:47.660 --> 06:48.880]  My devious contraption.
[06:49.140 --> 06:52.860]  You can't have 501 Friday without the rest of Friday.
[06:53.240 --> 06:53.680]  I love it.
[06:54.240 --> 06:55.180]  That's what I'm saying, baby.
[06:55.640 --> 06:56.800]  Let's put out a 501 shirt.
[06:58.160 --> 06:59.540]  We get sued by Levi's.
[06:59.980 --> 07:00.400]  Yeah, right.
[07:01.540 --> 07:02.940]  Oh, Geoff sucks.
[07:04.360 --> 07:05.360]  What got you that?
[07:05.360 --> 07:06.620]  Did you get killed by the plane?
[07:06.960 --> 07:08.200]  I got killed by my own stupidity.
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.300]  Oh, Gavin won.
[07:09.980 --> 07:11.100]  I got trap points.
[07:12.400 --> 07:12.580]  Hi.
[07:16.800 --> 07:17.280]  Hello.
[07:18.260 --> 07:19.040]  There you go, beard.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.280]  Okay, let's have a fun sing.
[07:24.320 --> 07:25.280]  AstroCamp25 says...
[07:25.280 --> 07:27.540]  Gerpol, gerpol, gerpol, gerpol, gerpol, gerpol, gerpol.
[07:28.780 --> 07:29.500]  Makes sense.
[07:30.780 --> 07:31.260]  Rules.
[07:32.520 --> 07:33.000]  Yes.
[07:33.820 --> 07:34.300]  Modifies.
[07:34.300 --> 07:35.920]  What'd you guys do this morning?
[07:37.640 --> 07:38.720]  Put war in my mouth.
[07:39.900 --> 07:41.120]  I did that, too.
[07:41.320 --> 07:43.300]  I had a couple of drinks, but I didn't drink them.
[07:45.680 --> 07:48.360]  We did some supplemental filming today.
[07:48.700 --> 07:48.940]  Yeah.
[07:49.780 --> 07:51.580]  When will it come out? We don't know.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.340]  We're still not through with the fuckface supplemental filming.
[07:54.980 --> 07:55.120]  Nope.
[07:56.640 --> 07:58.580]  Projectile speed faster? What the fuck?
[07:58.680 --> 07:59.800]  Oh, you can see what I'm doing, huh?
[07:59.920 --> 08:03.920]  We did measure our mouth size.
[08:04.560 --> 08:04.920]  Yep.
[08:05.180 --> 08:06.600]  And recorded it.
[08:06.600 --> 08:09.280]  Did you see my cut of blindfold sandwiches?
[08:10.340 --> 08:11.360]  Oh, no, I haven't watched it yet.
[08:11.540 --> 08:13.540]  How is it? Is it good? It's pretty funny?
[08:13.660 --> 08:14.860]  Yeah, I liked it.
[08:15.120 --> 08:16.000]  I'm excited to see it.
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.640]  We also had a surprise recording today that was inspired by Eric.
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.460]  Oh, yeah! That was fun.
[08:25.460 --> 08:27.920]  Where we measured how tall we all are in apples.
[08:28.540 --> 08:29.840]  Yeah, how many apples do you think you are?
[08:29.880 --> 08:31.740]  Yeah, how many apples tall do you think you are?
[08:31.740 --> 08:34.880]  I found out how many apples Hello Kitty was and then it just inspired me.
[08:35.140 --> 08:38.460]  I think we more measured how long we were than how tall we were.
[08:40.300 --> 08:42.200]  When you say it like that, I don't like it.
[08:42.360 --> 08:43.620]  Yeah, you're weird.
[08:46.060 --> 08:47.600]  You gotta ruin it.
[08:48.820 --> 08:49.780]  Cosmic crisp apples?
[08:49.940 --> 08:50.480]  Yeah, what do you think?
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.420]  What is happening?
[08:51.920 --> 08:52.780]  What's going on?
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.160]  I had to make sure it was cosmic crisp apples.
[08:55.400 --> 08:56.620]  I'm not gonna film with another apple.
[08:56.720 --> 08:57.280]  What's happening?
[08:57.760 --> 08:58.420]  I'm gonna get on that.
[08:59.640 --> 09:00.700]  He fucking got me.
[09:00.700 --> 09:01.980]  Did I get lag?
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.960]  I was dead before I could see me.
[09:04.080 --> 09:06.640]  Yeah, I just watched you die, dude.
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.620]  You guys got surfed.
[09:08.700 --> 09:09.880]  Yeah, what happened?
[09:10.280 --> 09:10.700]  Oh, puck!
[09:11.980 --> 09:12.460]  What?
[09:17.860 --> 09:18.700]  Oh, puck.
[09:20.560 --> 09:21.300]  There we go.
[09:23.180 --> 09:23.800]  Let's go!
[09:24.740 --> 09:25.380]  We just keep moving?
[09:25.620 --> 09:26.100]  What happened?
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.780]  You got surfed.
[09:28.820 --> 09:29.500]  Oh, puck!
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.140]  I got annihilated!
[09:33.720 --> 09:34.840]  Wow, Gavin is so on it.
[09:34.840 --> 09:36.200]  So we don't have to get on the surfboard?
[09:36.600 --> 09:37.580]  What the hell?
[09:37.700 --> 09:38.220]  You don't have to.
[09:39.240 --> 09:41.320]  Yeah, you guys are just in my way.
[09:41.560 --> 09:42.140]  Hello, Paula.
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.300]  She says puck face.
[09:45.720 --> 09:47.280]  Oh, now we're getting personal.
[09:51.070 --> 09:51.850]  Oh, my God.
[09:51.850 --> 09:52.770]  That's gonna really hurt me, though.
[09:53.690 --> 09:54.570]  Somebody asked,
[09:54.850 --> 09:57.730]  Eric, what's up with your 5-9-8-6 gamer tag?
[09:57.970 --> 09:58.890]  I don't know.
[09:58.890 --> 10:00.710]  I went to register my name,
[10:00.770 --> 10:02.870]  and it said, you can't have this, it's already taken.
[10:02.990 --> 10:04.770]  And I went, well, I know, I'm logging into my old account.
[10:04.890 --> 10:05.850]  And it said, no, you're not.
[10:06.050 --> 10:07.970]  And now I am. That's what I have.
[10:08.130 --> 10:09.370]  I hope that clears it up.
[10:09.850 --> 10:10.050]  Yep.
[10:14.770 --> 10:15.170]  MythicalJade
[10:15.170 --> 10:17.090]  didn't know that chili without beans
[10:17.090 --> 10:18.670]  was a thing until they were like 20.
[10:19.410 --> 10:19.570]  Yeah.
[10:19.570 --> 10:20.670]  And now we all know.
[10:23.450 --> 10:25.010]  Ooh, clap Friday.
[10:25.510 --> 10:25.910]  Friday.
[10:25.910 --> 10:26.050]  Friday.
[10:28.250 --> 10:29.210]  What am I doing here?
[10:29.270 --> 10:30.070]  What am I doing here?
[10:30.130 --> 10:33.450]  What do I want to do?
[10:33.670 --> 10:35.150]  I think I want to do this.
[10:35.310 --> 10:36.550]  Well, I can't collaborate with that.
[10:37.150 --> 10:38.350]  Yeah, that's sort of the point.
[10:38.510 --> 10:38.710]  Okay.
[10:40.590 --> 10:42.570]  JC Nightmare's looking to get all the money.
[10:46.100 --> 10:47.500]  Are we getting double pucked?
[10:48.140 --> 10:48.740]  I think it might be two.
[10:49.020 --> 10:50.440]  Oh, you kicked me into the thing.
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.620]  That's a book our wives read.
[10:53.380 --> 10:53.920]  Yeah, definitely.
[10:53.920 --> 10:54.760]  What?
[10:55.520 --> 10:56.600]  Oh, no!
[10:57.340 --> 10:58.900]  It was brutal.
[10:59.520 --> 11:00.740]  I got murked, dude.
[11:07.120 --> 11:08.040]  Disposable Jim
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.680]  wants to know what book I'm reading.
[11:10.180 --> 11:11.960]  Well, I just did another read-through
[11:11.960 --> 11:14.520]  of Celestial Glorbosis available on Amazon.
[11:15.420 --> 11:16.520]  That was pretty good.
[11:16.620 --> 11:17.880]  It gets better each time you read it.
[11:18.140 --> 11:20.340]  But currently I'm reading Swan in Love
[11:20.340 --> 11:21.540]  by Marcel Pouste.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.020]  Oh, you kicked me into the thing again!
[11:32.220 --> 11:33.340]  No, I got stuck!
[11:33.500 --> 11:34.140]  God damn it.
[11:36.660 --> 11:37.320]  Oh, man.
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.280]  This is a hard one.
[11:41.340 --> 11:43.280]  Whoa, I have to find the whales with...
[11:43.280 --> 11:44.240]  How many gifted subs?
[11:44.560 --> 11:45.680]  I couldn't even see. Ten?
[11:46.420 --> 11:47.320]  Holy shit, thanks.
[11:47.840 --> 11:48.460]  Thank you.
[11:48.620 --> 11:53.460]  Thanks to everyone who's watching, too.
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.380]  Thank you for watching.
[11:56.120 --> 11:57.020]  It's always a good time.
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.160]  Oh, people are
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.100]  talking about that Penguin show on the TV.
[12:05.240 --> 12:06.480]  Have you guys watched that? Is it any good?
[12:06.580 --> 12:06.960]  Oh, I did.
[12:09.800 --> 12:11.360]  Gavin just walking through it.
[12:11.440 --> 12:12.720]  Oh, Gavin, you idiot!
[12:13.400 --> 12:14.400]  Gavin, you moron!
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.220]  Is that a fake piece of
[12:17.220 --> 12:18.220]  pier? What happened?
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.620]  It's in the background!
[12:36.510 --> 12:38.250]  Well, I don't know how we're gonna...
[12:38.750 --> 12:40.090]  Ah, you idiot!
[12:40.510 --> 12:41.170]  Bastard man!
[12:41.570 --> 12:43.310]  This elephant keeps killing me!
[12:43.650 --> 12:45.510]  Right before it kills itself!
[12:46.730 --> 12:48.250]  Why would you just
[12:48.250 --> 12:50.270]  stood there and looked at it?
[12:51.010 --> 12:52.050]  I don't think you can get
[12:52.050 --> 12:52.810]  through there, can you?
[12:53.530 --> 12:56.150]  I think you have to go up it and just move really fast.
[13:07.400 --> 13:09.160]  You blew up your own thing.
[13:09.160 --> 13:10.480]  Yeah, I didn't want it there.
[13:10.620 --> 13:12.140]  He didn't want it there.
[13:16.410 --> 13:17.630]  Oh, you are
[13:17.630 --> 13:19.630]  my god!
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.100]  Hey, we got some
[13:27.100 --> 13:28.420]  piss rats in the chat.
[13:33.780 --> 13:35.040]  Somebody asked if I fixed
[13:35.040 --> 13:36.180]  my light issue on my bike.
[13:36.780 --> 13:37.840]  With duct tape.
[13:49.090 --> 13:50.590]  Oh, you're insane!
[13:53.650 --> 13:54.090]  Yes!
[13:58.990 --> 14:00.070]  We're all gone.
[14:01.530 --> 14:03.230]  Geoff went in the black hole somehow.
[14:08.590 --> 14:09.670]  I think I win by default.
[14:10.170 --> 14:10.870]  Yeah, no kidding.
[14:19.340 --> 14:20.980]  Oh, that's very interesting.
[14:21.440 --> 14:22.300]  Yeah, I wanna see
[14:22.300 --> 14:23.800]  what we can make happen.
[14:23.800 --> 14:24.300]  I'm nuts.
[14:27.440 --> 14:29.140]  You stupid elephant!
[14:37.390 --> 14:41.030]  I have keyed in
[14:41.030 --> 14:42.390]  to a certain kind of fun.
[14:42.730 --> 14:46.610]  It is delightful.
[14:54.770 --> 14:56.290]  Wow, that's...
[14:56.290 --> 14:57.330]  Gotta be quick though!
[14:57.590 --> 14:59.170]  No! Elephant!
[14:59.690 --> 15:01.090]  You fucking asshole.
[15:01.870 --> 15:02.690]  He fucked me.
[15:03.350 --> 15:05.210]  Alright, now I'm just gonna take it slow.
[15:05.430 --> 15:06.530]  Take it easy.
[15:07.230 --> 15:11.090]  Yes! There you go.
[15:11.310 --> 15:11.670]  Damn.
[15:12.490 --> 15:13.850]  With the two coins.
[15:16.710 --> 15:19.730]  Somebody asked if we're gonna do more GTA 4 videos.
[15:20.050 --> 15:20.990]  I don't know, are we?
[15:21.590 --> 15:23.290]  Yeah, we have like a lot in the hopper.
[15:24.710 --> 15:25.370]  GTA 4?
[15:25.490 --> 15:26.150]  There's a lot that haven't come out.
[15:27.650 --> 15:29.130]  Oh no, GTA 4!
[15:29.250 --> 15:30.330]  Oh no, we should.
[15:30.670 --> 15:32.550]  Yeah, I don't think we have anything else filmed in it.
[15:32.710 --> 15:33.830]  No, no, I was thinking of GTA Online or whatever.
[15:33.830 --> 15:36.570]  You guys did a dickload of GTA 5, but...
[15:37.630 --> 15:38.930]  Oh, I wanna try some of those
[15:38.930 --> 15:41.030]  GTA, those multiplayer modes that I saw
[15:41.030 --> 15:42.450]  in the Rockstar Museum I got.
[15:42.630 --> 15:43.170]  Yeah, we should do that.
[15:43.250 --> 15:44.670]  Delivering pizza or whatever. Be fun.
[15:48.970 --> 15:54.380]  Oh, come on!
[15:55.440 --> 15:56.440]  You don't wanna do Jungle Temple?
[15:57.480 --> 15:58.660]  No, I wanna do my thing.
[15:58.860 --> 15:59.400]  What was your one?
[16:00.320 --> 16:01.440]  I don't know.
[16:01.860 --> 16:02.980]  Well, that makes it hard to do.
[16:03.900 --> 16:06.800]  I wonder if there's more shit we could turn on in Crazy Traffic
[16:07.220 --> 16:08.100]  in GTA 4.
[16:08.440 --> 16:10.020]  Oh, probably. There's gotta be, right?
[16:10.740 --> 16:10.920]  Yeah.
[16:11.020 --> 16:12.140]  I'm sure there is.
[16:17.060 --> 16:18.800]  Although, if we do it again, we need to be...
[16:19.120 --> 16:19.500]  I hate Geoff.
[16:19.500 --> 16:21.180]  We need to be on...
[16:21.180 --> 16:23.000]  a game save that has all the islands unlocked.
[16:23.800 --> 16:24.560]  Uh, that's a good call.
[16:25.200 --> 16:27.720]  I'm sure that's something you can...
[16:28.400 --> 16:29.820]  Well, yeah, I can just play again.
[16:30.620 --> 16:31.400]  Well, yeah, I was gonna say,
[16:31.460 --> 16:33.560]  we could probably just edit a file, too.
[16:33.960 --> 16:34.800]  Yeah, I could send you my file.
[16:35.300 --> 16:35.500]  Yeah.
[16:41.120 --> 16:41.740]  Geoff, die.
[16:42.240 --> 16:43.000]  I don't want to.
[16:45.660 --> 16:46.460]  I've finished!
[16:47.840 --> 16:49.060]  Any more heist videos
[16:49.060 --> 16:50.060]  coming out soon.
[16:50.060 --> 16:52.260]  I have no idea when they're coming out,
[16:52.380 --> 16:54.080]  but you guys have recorded how many?
[16:54.320 --> 16:55.120]  Like, five or six?
[16:55.660 --> 16:56.040]  Yeah, a bunch.
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.940]  And we just got a final cut of part three?
[16:59.740 --> 16:59.940]  Dang.
[17:01.260 --> 17:02.800]  How many have released, two?
[17:03.280 --> 17:03.980]  Two, I think.
[17:05.140 --> 17:07.360]  And don't worry, they all feature Nick losing his mind.
[17:08.200 --> 17:08.600]  Goddamn.
[17:08.940 --> 17:11.740]  That's becoming a pretty common feature in a lot of videos lately.
[17:11.920 --> 17:14.360]  I just don't get how he is, like,
[17:14.480 --> 17:15.360]  the way he is.
[17:15.680 --> 17:16.860]  I just don't...
[17:16.860 --> 17:17.280]  Oh, no.
[17:18.360 --> 17:21.020]  I've been, like, two companies with him, and he's a psycho in both of them.
[17:21.300 --> 17:22.500]  What? I got squished?
[17:23.420 --> 17:24.300]  Oh, shit.
[17:24.820 --> 17:25.260]  Solo.
[17:29.840 --> 17:30.280]  Damn.
[17:35.790 --> 17:36.610]  I took it.
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.700]  Alright, boys.
[17:52.320 --> 17:53.180]  You going for it?
[17:53.540 --> 17:54.440]  That's crazy.
[17:55.420 --> 17:56.760]  You'll never make it.
[17:57.300 --> 17:58.020]  I didn't make it.
[17:58.960 --> 18:01.440]  I wonder if I can sneak that somehow.
[18:01.600 --> 18:02.600]  Do it. Do it. Do it.
[18:02.860 --> 18:03.280]  Do it.
[18:04.300 --> 18:05.360]  Almost. Keep going.
[18:05.440 --> 18:06.460]  Oh, fuck you.
[18:10.720 --> 18:11.600]  You can do it.
[18:12.220 --> 18:13.040]  He got it.
[18:13.720 --> 18:15.560]  You got it. Come on. Get it.
[18:16.100 --> 18:16.860]  Come on.
[18:17.280 --> 18:18.440]  You can do it.
[18:18.900 --> 18:20.160]  It has to be a lower jump.
[18:21.460 --> 18:23.220]  Tap. Tap jump.
[18:24.180 --> 18:24.780]  There you go.
[18:24.780 --> 18:26.240]  Oh, you almost had it. That was it.
[18:26.420 --> 18:27.560]  You just had it.
[18:27.560 --> 18:30.540]  I know, because you can get it.
[18:30.880 --> 18:32.040]  You're right there.
[18:32.800 --> 18:33.760]  Dude, you can get that.
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.220]  There's no way you can't.
[18:35.460 --> 18:37.120]  You're early on the jump.
[18:38.500 --> 18:39.880]  Boom. Nailed it.
[18:40.260 --> 18:41.020]  Easy peasy.
[18:41.700 --> 18:43.420]  I really thought he was going to die. That sucks.
[18:45.140 --> 18:46.500]  I had zero faith in you.
[18:46.920 --> 18:47.700]  I'm furious.
[18:49.200 --> 18:49.620]  Ridiculous.
[18:50.320 --> 18:52.660]  There was nothing sincere about any of that.
[18:52.660 --> 18:53.600]  Nuh-uh. Zero.
[18:53.780 --> 18:54.940]  I hate you.
[18:58.020 --> 18:59.080]  I don't hate you.
[18:59.580 --> 19:00.980]  What the fuck, Gavin?
[19:01.200 --> 19:03.480]  Why would you...
[19:03.480 --> 19:04.900]  Just be careful there at the start.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  That's pretty hard.
[19:10.780 --> 19:12.360]  I thought I could slide under it.
[19:15.680 --> 19:16.920]  Damn, look at him go.
[19:18.600 --> 19:19.640]  Look at him go.
[19:19.640 --> 19:20.220]  Karma.
[19:23.500 --> 19:24.840]  That would have won it, I think.
[19:28.720 --> 19:31.800]  I think we both got it.
[19:31.960 --> 19:32.820]  Oh, shit.
[19:35.560 --> 19:36.300]  Donkey Kong it.
[19:37.280 --> 19:37.920]  Yeah, there you go.
[19:38.140 --> 19:43.460]  Yeah, that's it.
[19:44.080 --> 19:44.480]  That's good.
[19:45.900 --> 19:47.160]  Gotta really want it.
[19:49.940 --> 19:50.740]  You idiot.
[19:51.440 --> 19:51.760]  No!
[19:55.460 --> 19:57.620]  Come on, you gotta go for the...
[19:57.620 --> 19:58.460]  Oh, you gotta shoot it.
[20:00.140 --> 20:01.280]  Send me!
[20:08.420 --> 20:09.860]  Damn it.
[20:11.500 --> 20:12.960]  That would have been great.
[20:17.350 --> 20:18.570]  Good times.
[20:19.150 --> 20:20.670]  No, I hit the wrong button!
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.080]  Oh my god, you're a psychopath.
[20:34.120 --> 20:34.580]  Damn.
[20:45.980 --> 20:47.640]  That would have been amazing.
[20:48.440 --> 20:49.780]  It was on the run of a lifetime.
[20:53.450 --> 20:54.290]  Hey, Rebecca.
[20:54.830 --> 20:55.790]  Hey, what's up, Rebecca?
[20:55.790 --> 20:58.150]  Blow something up.
[20:58.150 --> 20:59.190]  God, finally.
[20:59.990 --> 21:00.550]  No!
[21:03.470 --> 21:05.030]  Geoff, don't blow that up!
[21:05.130 --> 21:06.350]  That's the only way to get back!
[21:06.970 --> 21:08.170]  You said finally.
[21:10.970 --> 21:11.990]  There you go.
[21:16.990 --> 21:17.350]  No!
[21:18.370 --> 21:19.250]  Super dead.
[21:24.250 --> 21:25.170]  Damn it.
[21:25.170 --> 21:25.830]  Hmm.
[21:31.150 --> 21:47.360]  Oh, I forgot about the other one!
[21:49.460 --> 21:50.300]  Idiot!
[21:52.600 --> 21:54.160]  Oh, shit, that's Geoff.
[21:54.700 --> 21:55.800]  Oh, no!
[21:56.700 --> 21:57.120]  Yes!
[21:58.760 --> 21:59.600]  Yes!
[22:01.640 --> 22:03.160]  Come back, coin!
[22:03.480 --> 22:05.120]  Holy shit.
[22:05.880 --> 22:06.560]  Boys!
[22:06.560 --> 22:08.640]  Look at that!
[22:23.300 --> 22:24.340]  You elephant!
[22:25.560 --> 22:26.560]  That's me, I'm an elephant.
[22:28.580 --> 22:29.620]  Hurry up and die!
[22:30.520 --> 22:31.740]  Oh, will it be the double coin
[22:31.740 --> 22:32.640]  comeback win?
[22:32.780 --> 22:34.180]  No shot, no shot.
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.160]  He doesn't have the guts!
[22:37.100 --> 22:37.800]  I was close.
[22:38.140 --> 22:39.080]  Are you holding X, Geoff?
[22:39.400 --> 22:42.020]  Yeah, it's for Jason.
[22:43.100 --> 22:43.620]  What?
[22:44.700 --> 22:45.780]  That's X for Jason.
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.800]  Remember that?
[22:48.160 --> 22:49.660]  Heavy rain is a thing.
[22:52.100 --> 22:53.500]  The fuck are you saying?
[22:53.960 --> 22:55.140]  Remember that game?
[22:57.740 --> 22:59.240]  To find Jason, remember?
[22:59.760 --> 23:01.480]  He was lost in the mall, you had to hit a button
[23:01.480 --> 23:02.740]  and it was like press X, I believe.
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.320]  How do I kick Geoff?
[23:04.500 --> 23:06.960]  I'm trying to...
[23:09.100 --> 23:10.360]  Oh, my plank.
[23:16.630 --> 23:17.150]  Okay.
[23:20.170 --> 23:21.990]  Alright, let's do some clear up on this one.
[23:22.230 --> 23:23.870]  No! No! No!
[23:24.290 --> 23:25.830]  Yes! Yes! Yes!
[23:26.030 --> 23:27.090]  Yes! Yes!
[23:27.430 --> 23:28.850]  Son of a bitch.
[23:31.790 --> 23:33.070]  Oh, I was totally right.
[23:33.150 --> 23:33.990]  Press X to Jason.
[23:34.630 --> 23:35.430]  That is right.
[23:35.710 --> 23:37.650]  You fuckin' PlayStation gamers, you don't even know.
[23:39.310 --> 23:40.230]  Oh, it's a
[23:40.230 --> 23:41.770]  frickin' tie break!
[23:43.810 --> 23:45.190]  First to reach the flat wins!
[23:46.230 --> 23:46.590]  Oops.
[23:48.710 --> 23:49.070]  Okay.
[23:51.370 --> 23:52.270]  God damn it.
[23:56.780 --> 23:58.040]  Oh, I came back to life?
[23:58.300 --> 23:59.520]  I didn't realize I could do it again!
[24:00.060 --> 24:01.700]  The ultimate raccoon, baby!
[24:02.920 --> 24:03.400]  That's awesome.
[24:03.420 --> 24:05.560]  Yeah, you came back to life and you just didn't do anything.
[24:05.680 --> 24:06.340]  That was pretty cool.
[24:07.400 --> 24:07.760]  Congratulations.
[24:08.680 --> 24:10.840]  Yeah, why would I tell you? I wanted to win, idiot.
[24:11.220 --> 24:13.560]  He's got a point there. Let's do another one, though.
[24:14.080 --> 24:14.760]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[24:15.240 --> 24:16.840]  We're getting on to 5-0-1, guys.
[24:16.960 --> 24:18.120]  424, we're almost there.
[24:18.340 --> 24:19.800]  There might be a new level in this level.
[24:20.420 --> 24:21.040]  Oh, you think so?
[24:21.060 --> 24:22.200]  It says question mark.
[24:32.180 --> 24:32.580]  Oh!
[24:33.020 --> 24:34.220]  Oh, there is something up there.
[24:38.080 --> 24:39.280]  Where do we start?
[24:42.720 --> 24:43.940]  We'll get something normal style.
[24:44.160 --> 24:44.420]  We're good.
[24:48.090 --> 24:48.450]  Okay.
[24:48.690 --> 24:52.590]  It'll be a level or it'll be like a hat for Eric.
[24:52.590 --> 24:55.330]  It better be a hat for Eric.
[24:56.410 --> 24:57.290]  There you go, Geoff.
[24:57.490 --> 24:58.610]  That fucking killed me dead.
[24:59.810 --> 25:01.530]  Oh, you discovered a new level.
[25:01.530 --> 25:03.390]  It was a level for Geoff that I already had.
[25:03.490 --> 25:03.890]  Thank you.
[25:06.430 --> 25:07.830]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[25:17.880 --> 25:19.920]  I guess that's why you're not supposed to go chasing them
[25:19.920 --> 25:21.800]  because when you're ready for them, they'll be right there.
[25:25.560 --> 25:26.620]  That must be it.
[25:26.960 --> 25:28.040]  Oh my god, that's crazy.
[25:28.040 --> 25:28.400]  Fuck.
[25:34.100 --> 25:36.660]  Oh, someone messed with the lift as well.
[25:41.910 --> 25:43.050]  What happened to me?
[25:43.850 --> 25:44.170]  What?
[25:45.070 --> 25:46.690]  What happened to me?
[25:46.990 --> 25:48.630]  I got iced into the cloth.
[25:48.910 --> 25:50.370]  What happened to me?
[25:54.270 --> 25:55.710]  Hmm, how am I going to do this?
[25:58.230 --> 25:59.350]  Hmm, okay.
[25:59.750 --> 26:00.550]  Alright, hang on.
[26:01.310 --> 26:02.650]  So I've thought...
[26:02.650 --> 26:04.610]  Now I've considered my mistakes.
[26:05.190 --> 26:07.130]  I've thought long and hard about this.
[26:08.390 --> 26:08.670]  How?
[26:11.950 --> 26:13.290]  Where am I supposed to...
[26:13.290 --> 26:13.430]  How?
[26:13.610 --> 26:13.910]  No!
[26:16.910 --> 26:19.210]  I had to see what I could jump into
[26:19.210 --> 26:20.070]  and what I could avoid.
[26:25.800 --> 26:27.140]  When do you see Geoff
[26:27.140 --> 26:28.160]  in celebrity boxing?
[26:28.440 --> 26:29.600]  That will never happen.
[26:40.090 --> 26:40.430]  Hmm.
[26:43.750 --> 26:44.270]  Oh,
[26:44.470 --> 26:46.330]  did someone throw me upwards?
[26:46.450 --> 26:47.790]  How did I jump so high?
[26:48.090 --> 26:50.170]  I did, you bounced off me.
[26:50.590 --> 26:51.690]  That sucks!
[26:52.490 --> 26:53.790]  No, I thought it was pretty cool.
[26:55.970 --> 26:57.210]  Don't die, don't die, don't die!
[26:57.470 --> 26:57.990]  No!
[26:59.850 --> 27:01.190]  Oh, that killed me.
[27:01.790 --> 27:03.050]  What did you die on?
[27:03.310 --> 27:04.550]  Sharp glass.
[27:04.850 --> 27:05.350]  Oh, same.
[27:07.310 --> 27:09.770]  I didn't realize that was sharp glass.
[27:09.770 --> 27:11.010]  Yeah, it's sharp.
[27:15.370 --> 27:16.290]  Fucking hell.
[27:18.530 --> 27:19.470]  I don't want this.
[27:20.510 --> 27:21.350]  What was that?
[27:22.330 --> 27:22.810]  You
[27:24.130 --> 27:24.610]  fool.
[27:25.910 --> 27:27.130]  Do something about it.
[27:27.970 --> 27:29.190]  Do something about it, bitch.
[27:30.670 --> 27:32.050]  I didn't have to say the last part,
[27:32.170 --> 27:32.890]  Geoff said it for me.
[27:36.010 --> 27:37.370]  No, you pushed me!
[27:37.370 --> 27:39.390]  Oh, you just tackled me
[27:39.390 --> 27:41.730]  into the fricking thorns!
[27:42.190 --> 27:43.450]  Right into the bramble.
[27:44.330 --> 27:45.410]  Why are you staying on it?
[27:45.770 --> 27:46.610]  Why did it kill me?
[27:48.050 --> 27:49.070]  I'm getting smushed.
[27:50.290 --> 27:50.890]  Smushed.
[27:52.150 --> 27:53.230]  Oh, man.
[28:07.920 --> 28:08.520]  Why?
[28:10.600 --> 28:11.600]  Gotta do something.
[28:13.640 --> 28:14.980]  I gotta do something.
[28:14.980 --> 28:15.500]  And I'm dead.
[28:16.960 --> 28:17.440]  No!
[28:18.660 --> 28:20.560]  I didn't know the propeller could kill you.
[28:20.660 --> 28:21.300]  That's terrible.
[28:21.780 --> 28:22.880]  Yeah, it shot blade.
[28:23.260 --> 28:24.160]  Yeah, it killed me a bunch.
[28:26.300 --> 28:26.780]  Damn.
[28:29.060 --> 28:29.520]  Puck!
[28:31.160 --> 28:31.900]  Oh, money.
[28:40.690 --> 28:41.650]  Holy shit.
[28:42.190 --> 28:43.970]  It's getting insane over there.
[28:44.070 --> 28:44.470]  Be careful.
[28:44.930 --> 28:45.150]  Money!
[28:47.770 --> 28:49.350]  Ah, this is so good.
[28:49.350 --> 28:50.170]  Yeah.
[28:51.950 --> 28:53.090]  Oh, don't worry.
[28:53.130 --> 28:53.570]  Eric wins.
[28:56.070 --> 28:57.170]  Steal that from him, Geoff.
[28:58.930 --> 28:59.730]  Damn it!
[29:00.190 --> 29:01.490]  No points except for the coin
[29:01.490 --> 29:02.190]  if Geoff finishes.
[29:03.670 --> 29:04.630]  Jesus Christ.
[29:04.750 --> 29:05.930]  Geoff is scared.
[29:06.950 --> 29:08.450]  Look at the fear in Mudang.
[29:11.150 --> 29:11.670]  Damn.
[29:15.330 --> 29:15.990]  Punch glove.
[29:15.990 --> 29:17.070]  Oh, fuck.
[29:27.730 --> 29:29.010]  God damn it.
[29:29.550 --> 29:30.670]  God damn it.
[29:31.690 --> 29:33.270]  No, short blast!
[29:39.640 --> 29:40.060]  Okay.
[29:40.840 --> 29:41.780]  Oh my god.
[29:43.140 --> 29:43.660]  Crazy.
[29:45.860 --> 29:46.240]  Damn.
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.640]  Damn, damn, damn.
[29:49.360 --> 29:52.000]  Somebody in the audience asked if we would play Fall Guys again someday.
[29:52.140 --> 29:52.780]  I think so, right?
[29:52.940 --> 29:53.540]  We had fun with that.
[29:53.540 --> 29:54.980]  That was a good time.
[29:56.200 --> 29:56.620]  Which one was that?
[29:56.680 --> 29:57.940]  The little bean guys?
[29:58.860 --> 30:00.460]  Yeah, it's like...
[30:01.140 --> 30:03.680]  It's the same dudes that you fight with
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.900]  but you're not fighting this time.
[30:05.880 --> 30:06.940]  A question mark?
[30:07.400 --> 30:08.900]  Yeah, we just did that level there.
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.840]  But it's the question mark level.
[30:12.120 --> 30:13.280]  You can do it again if you want.
[30:14.180 --> 30:15.880]  There's a rollercoaster question mark.
[30:16.420 --> 30:16.840]  Where?
[30:17.240 --> 30:18.080]  Oh, let's do that.
[30:19.720 --> 30:20.240]  Boom.
[30:21.320 --> 30:21.960]  Love it.
[30:33.170 --> 30:35.750]  Mark Sally is craving a hot dog.
[30:35.930 --> 30:36.690]  I know that game.
[30:37.470 --> 30:39.630]  Can 5pm on Fridays be regulation hot dog time?
[30:39.710 --> 30:40.310]  I don't see why not.
[30:41.610 --> 30:43.110]  I haven't had a hot dog in a couple days.
[30:44.270 --> 30:45.950]  Actually, I haven't had a hot dog since England.
[30:46.330 --> 30:47.070]  That's been a while.
[30:47.890 --> 30:49.010]  How were the English dogs?
[30:49.230 --> 30:49.990]  Oh, it was dog shit.
[30:51.350 --> 30:52.550]  That's not fair. It wasn't dog shit.
[30:52.570 --> 30:53.330]  It was very mediocre.
[30:54.290 --> 30:55.890]  I'd give it like a 6 out of 10.
[30:56.870 --> 30:57.750]  Damn it!
[30:58.390 --> 30:59.530]  Nice build, guys.
[30:59.650 --> 31:00.650]  What do we do next?
[31:01.330 --> 31:02.290]  You figure it out.
[31:02.630 --> 31:03.410]  Yeah, you're the genius.
[31:05.230 --> 31:08.890]  I need to wait until the fan is at its lowest.
[31:09.370 --> 31:10.610]  Not get hit by the rollercoaster.
[31:11.010 --> 31:12.050]  Land on the fan.
[31:12.230 --> 31:12.430]  Now!
[31:13.810 --> 31:15.850]  Oh, you missed it.
[31:15.950 --> 31:16.430]  You blew it.
[31:17.770 --> 31:19.130]  Now you haven't done it.
[31:19.210 --> 31:20.630]  Watch this.
[31:21.950 --> 31:23.990]  You thought you could jump through the railing,
[31:23.990 --> 31:25.270]  but you can't.
[31:25.590 --> 31:28.030]  I knew you couldn't, but I thought the fan was low enough.
[31:30.530 --> 31:30.930]  Disappointment.
[31:33.050 --> 31:33.450]  Disappointing.
[31:38.720 --> 31:40.660]  We had a pretty good flub of
[31:40.660 --> 31:42.680]  Regulatory on recently that I was happy with.
[31:43.100 --> 31:44.060]  I don't remember where it was.
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.540]  Was it yesterday?
[31:46.920 --> 31:48.240]  I think so. It was phenomenal.
[31:50.180 --> 31:50.860]  Oh, I can't see the...
[31:54.520 --> 31:54.920]  No!
[31:54.920 --> 31:55.000]  No!
[31:56.700 --> 31:58.340]  Thought I was just low enough.
[31:58.520 --> 31:59.100]  And I wasn't.
[32:00.660 --> 32:01.920]  That's a hard jump, man.
[32:02.400 --> 32:04.680]  I'm a careful, cautious
[32:04.680 --> 32:05.440]  little elephant.
[32:05.920 --> 32:07.280]  I'm gonna do what I did with that coin.
[32:08.280 --> 32:09.120]  Way to go, buddy.
[32:16.880 --> 32:18.660]  I'm a stupid,
[32:18.860 --> 32:19.960]  short-sighted little elephant.
[32:21.320 --> 32:22.040]  It's true.
[32:22.280 --> 32:22.860]  I've seen it.
[32:30.530 --> 32:31.790]  What the fuck?
[32:32.810 --> 32:33.410]  What's that?
[32:36.940 --> 32:37.980]  Oh, shit, Eric.
[32:38.700 --> 32:39.440]  Oh, shit, Eric.
[32:39.520 --> 32:41.880]  No! I was trying to bounce off the side.
[32:43.540 --> 32:44.460]  Can I go on this?
[32:44.820 --> 32:46.220]  Trying to get freaky-beaky, baby.
[32:46.580 --> 32:47.320]  Don't get punched.
[32:48.460 --> 32:49.400]  You missed it.
[32:50.660 --> 32:54.040]  Alright, Geoff, you got this thing.
[32:54.080 --> 32:55.980]  You got it, buddy. Here you go. Boom!
[32:56.380 --> 32:57.660]  And here he goes.
[32:59.320 --> 32:59.720]  Fuck.
[32:59.720 --> 33:00.780]  Can I hit that thing with a jump?
[33:02.640 --> 33:03.720]  You hit your head on that,
[33:03.840 --> 33:04.200]  big guy.
[33:13.160 --> 33:14.180]  I like that you can
[33:14.180 --> 33:15.280]  make your curse a sprint.
[33:19.890 --> 33:21.150]  What do I want to get rid of?
[33:21.610 --> 33:22.650]  Nothing. That's crazy.
[33:22.990 --> 33:24.190]  I think I dumped it here.
[33:25.230 --> 33:25.970]  I don't like that.
[33:26.710 --> 33:28.430]  I don't like that one specific part.
[33:29.210 --> 33:30.810]  The rest of it is allowed to stay.
[33:32.890 --> 33:33.450]  Are you gonna
[33:33.450 --> 33:35.010]  throw? What's this thing doing?
[33:35.130 --> 33:35.490]  There we go.
[33:36.330 --> 33:40.910]  Get punched.
[33:41.210 --> 33:42.610]  No! No! No!
[33:44.910 --> 33:45.710]  Fuckin' idiot.
[33:49.700 --> 33:50.660]  That was great.
[33:51.740 --> 33:53.540]  We still haven't reached the end
[33:53.540 --> 33:54.100]  once.
[33:54.900 --> 33:57.540]  There's some pretty heavy onion talk going on in the chat.
[33:58.020 --> 33:59.180]  Oh, what's the latest on onions?
[34:00.240 --> 34:01.500]  A lot of people like
[34:01.500 --> 34:03.440]  onion straws, people like raw
[34:03.440 --> 34:05.280]  onion, crispy onions.
[34:05.360 --> 34:07.300]  Grilled is better, but sometimes you need the
[34:07.300 --> 34:08.540]  crunch of a raw onion.
[34:08.740 --> 34:10.360]  I agree with all that.
[34:11.260 --> 34:12.760]  I'll take an onion in any form.
[34:14.780 --> 34:15.260]  Bloomin'?
[34:15.260 --> 34:16.520]  Yeah. Fuck yeah, dude.
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.760]  We've been on a bloomin' kick.
[34:19.900 --> 34:20.440]  Have we?
[34:21.440 --> 34:23.240]  I went with your wife
[34:23.240 --> 34:24.340]  to go get a bloomin' onion.
[34:26.340 --> 34:27.360]  Hit the button!
[34:29.820 --> 34:31.160]  Went to Texas Roadhouse
[34:31.160 --> 34:32.900]  to get it two more times
[34:34.260 --> 34:35.220]  with Burndog
[34:35.220 --> 34:35.640]  and Vanessa.
[34:38.900 --> 34:39.900]  You killed me!
[34:40.980 --> 34:42.240]  You killed me!
[34:42.680 --> 34:43.660]  You killed me!
[34:44.420 --> 34:45.880]  A lot of blame going around.
[34:49.200 --> 34:50.220]  It's apparently a very
[34:50.700 --> 34:52.680]  common final sentence to say.
[34:53.380 --> 34:54.700]  You killed me? You killed me.
[34:55.620 --> 34:56.500]  Oh, what was that?
[34:56.720 --> 34:57.140]  Oh!
[35:00.300 --> 35:01.800]  Too easy, I don't want you to have that.
[35:04.900 --> 35:06.760]  What the fuck?!
[35:07.420 --> 35:08.900]  I've never seen
[35:08.900 --> 35:09.960]  that happen so early.
[35:25.180 --> 35:33.140]  Dude, I don't know why that was so funny.
[35:33.140 --> 35:35.440]  That was really good. That was really, really funny.
[35:35.560 --> 35:36.240]  Holy shit.
[35:37.560 --> 35:39.140]  Anybody saw it comin'?
[35:39.720 --> 35:41.220]  Oh, wow, that's a new level!
[35:41.460 --> 35:42.900]  I've never played that. We gotta play that level.
[35:43.460 --> 35:43.720]  Okay.
[35:44.880 --> 35:46.960]  Somebody has to win, finally, and then we can do it.
[35:47.100 --> 35:48.440]  Metro Boomin'. Let's do it.
[35:51.620 --> 35:53.200]  That'd be a great social clip.
[35:53.280 --> 35:54.860]  You just getting eaten by the...
[35:54.860 --> 35:57.380]  Both just going in the rollercoaster.
[35:59.600 --> 36:00.120]  Oh.
[36:03.630 --> 36:04.150]  Oh!
[36:04.370 --> 36:05.210]  I need that!
[36:10.690 --> 36:12.230]  Get off of me!
[36:12.390 --> 36:14.730]  You stood on my head until I died, you idiot!
[36:14.930 --> 36:16.230]  You stood on me!
[36:16.810 --> 36:18.330]  You were on me!
[36:18.470 --> 36:19.590]  I wasn't on you!
[36:19.790 --> 36:21.170]  On my screen, you were on me!
[36:21.370 --> 36:21.770]  No!
[36:21.770 --> 36:22.110]  What was that?
[36:22.490 --> 36:29.130]  Oh, Christ.
[36:40.010 --> 36:40.490]  Brutal.
[36:43.650 --> 36:45.690]  How did you not get hit by that?
[36:46.010 --> 36:46.630]  Dodged it.
[36:47.330 --> 36:48.970]  And I dodged the platform, but not below it.
[36:49.390 --> 36:50.390]  Yeah, saw that.
[36:53.410 --> 36:54.270]  I'm not worried, though.
[36:54.290 --> 36:55.190]  Neither of you will make it.
[36:56.070 --> 36:56.490]  Hey!
[36:56.710 --> 36:57.410]  What the...
[37:00.190 --> 37:00.610]  Geoff!
[37:00.990 --> 37:01.810]  What the fuck happened?
[37:01.870 --> 37:03.130]  Were you on each other's heads again?
[37:03.150 --> 37:04.270]  He pushed me off!
[37:05.010 --> 37:06.630]  You just both did nothing.
[37:08.050 --> 37:09.250]  He pushed me off!
[37:09.590 --> 37:10.910]  You pushed me!
[37:11.050 --> 37:11.990]  I didn't push anybody!
[37:12.650 --> 37:13.650]  You were on my right!
[37:13.850 --> 37:15.090]  Dude, I was minding my own business.
[37:24.120 --> 37:25.100]  You're crazy.
[37:26.760 --> 37:28.100]  No, you saw it!
[37:28.240 --> 37:28.460]  No!
[37:29.540 --> 37:30.060]  No!
[37:32.460 --> 37:33.500]  Raccoon wins!
[37:33.720 --> 37:34.540]  Damn you!
[37:34.780 --> 37:36.200]  Stop paying attention to me!
[37:39.700 --> 37:41.300]  I'll go ahead and sew this up.
[37:41.840 --> 37:42.560]  Here we go.
[37:43.260 --> 37:44.600]  Here comes a big...
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.680]  Geoff, come from behind.
[37:46.040 --> 37:47.380]  There's a portal right behind you.
[37:47.980 --> 37:48.500]  Yeah.
[37:48.500 --> 37:50.100]  Yeah.
[37:51.660 --> 37:53.240]  I was gonna do it that way.
[37:53.600 --> 37:54.540]  Oh, man.
[37:56.800 --> 37:57.600]  No!
[38:06.970 --> 38:07.370]  No!
[38:12.690 --> 38:13.490]  Oh.
[38:14.490 --> 38:16.130]  How bad do you want it?
[38:16.230 --> 38:16.950]  Really bad.
[38:18.030 --> 38:18.830]  Yes!
[38:23.610 --> 38:24.030]  What?
[38:25.090 --> 38:26.710]  Oh, I died!
[38:26.810 --> 38:27.750]  I'm dead!
[38:27.750 --> 38:27.950]  I'm dead!
[38:28.650 --> 38:30.570]  You arrived dead.
[38:31.470 --> 38:32.930]  Did I live?
[38:33.910 --> 38:34.670]  I lived!
[38:36.010 --> 38:36.670]  Yes!
[38:41.310 --> 38:44.010]  He just showed up dead.
[38:45.030 --> 38:45.930]  Oh, my God.
[38:48.470 --> 38:48.910]  No.
[38:50.570 --> 38:52.130]  How bad do you want it?
[38:52.270 --> 38:52.690]  Loads.
[39:03.870 --> 39:05.050]  Psycho shit.
[39:08.720 --> 39:09.380]  No!
[39:11.160 --> 39:12.300]  Did you die?
[39:12.820 --> 39:13.520]  Did I?
[39:14.200 --> 39:15.500]  Where did I come out?
[39:16.180 --> 39:17.080]  Where did you go?
[39:17.220 --> 39:19.680]  What happened? You went to hell!
[39:19.920 --> 39:20.780]  I got eaten.
[39:38.630 --> 39:40.770]  What's gonna be safest for me?
[39:42.370 --> 39:43.690]  Maybe this.
[39:44.790 --> 39:45.790]  Yeah.
[39:46.350 --> 39:47.350]  This.
[39:49.630 --> 39:50.130]  Geronimo!
[39:51.330 --> 39:51.830]  No!
[39:53.110 --> 39:58.870]  What happened?
[39:59.670 --> 40:01.050]  I just stood up and died.
[40:01.910 --> 40:02.630]  Oh, my God.
[40:05.270 --> 40:05.770]  Hey!
[40:06.730 --> 40:07.850]  Jesus Christ.
[40:08.430 --> 40:09.250]  You got a new level.
[40:09.250 --> 40:11.370]  Yeah, we gotta go check it out.
[40:11.430 --> 40:12.230]  Let's check out the Metro.
[40:12.670 --> 40:13.790]  Play that until 5.01.
[40:15.830 --> 40:16.610]  20 minutes, guys.
[40:16.710 --> 40:17.690]  Thank you so much for watching.
[40:18.250 --> 40:21.030]  None of you motherfuckers exist again to me until Monday.
[40:21.130 --> 40:22.330]  Unless I hang out with you this weekend.
[40:25.310 --> 40:26.450]  Gavin, I think I might be available.
[40:26.570 --> 40:27.350]  I just have to check with my wife.
[40:28.650 --> 40:29.490]  I'm doing the same thing.
[40:30.270 --> 40:30.550]  Interesting.
[40:33.590 --> 40:34.630]  Go, go, now, Joey.
[40:35.010 --> 40:35.750]  Tamara got married.
[40:35.750 --> 40:38.130]  Oh, that's fun.
[40:39.250 --> 40:40.210]  Where is it?
[40:40.290 --> 40:40.770]  It's underground.
[40:41.330 --> 40:44.290]  Oh, it's over here.
[40:44.350 --> 40:44.810]  Oh, okay.
[40:46.330 --> 40:47.170]  Dude, look at that.
[40:47.870 --> 40:48.410]  That's pretty cool.
[40:49.230 --> 40:51.550]  I can't wait to watch Geoff get hit by a train.
[40:53.070 --> 40:54.030]  BBL Drizzy.
[40:55.850 --> 40:58.310]  Geoff, walk to the fucking right.
[40:58.990 --> 40:59.530]  My name's Geoff.
[41:01.330 --> 41:01.810]  Christ.
[41:03.190 --> 41:05.970]  I love that Gavin still uses the same skin for the last decade.
[41:07.230 --> 41:08.670]  Has it been that long?
[41:08.830 --> 41:09.090]  Shit.
[41:09.550 --> 41:11.570]  Maybe it's time to switch it up.
[41:12.310 --> 41:13.590]  Geoff, sit still!
[41:18.190 --> 41:19.910]  Physically incapable of stopping.
[41:20.690 --> 41:21.510]  Sounds right.
[41:29.130 --> 41:31.690]  Can we walk on the tracks?
[41:31.930 --> 41:32.730]  I bet we can't.
[41:35.770 --> 41:36.670]  I don't know how this works.
[41:38.010 --> 41:39.430]  Only one way to find out, boys.
[41:41.250 --> 41:42.330]  Oh my god.
[41:44.430 --> 41:44.870]  Nice.
[41:45.030 --> 41:46.530]  It's all electrified all the time.
[41:47.390 --> 41:48.050]  Oh, a turtle!
[41:48.430 --> 41:49.170]  Oh, shit!
[41:51.170 --> 41:53.050]  I didn't realize it was so big.
[41:53.510 --> 41:55.970]  Yeah, I didn't know how exactly it happened.
[41:56.350 --> 41:58.150]  You have to go very fast on this level.
[41:58.350 --> 41:59.450]  Is it always electrified?
[42:00.590 --> 42:02.470]  It was electrified for me the whole time.
[42:10.280 --> 42:12.060]  Putting it back is diabolical.
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.480]  I started dead!
[42:14.680 --> 42:15.100]  Ah, shit!
[42:15.600 --> 42:17.000]  I can't get away from it!
[42:17.020 --> 42:18.500]  Oh, it's electrified the whole time.
[42:18.640 --> 42:19.840]  Even when it's not zapping.
[42:21.020 --> 42:23.920]  No, even when it's off, it's electrified.
[42:24.600 --> 42:25.020]  Are you sure?
[42:25.760 --> 42:27.900]  I touched it twice when it was off,
[42:27.920 --> 42:29.020]  and it killed me both times.
[42:29.720 --> 42:31.000]  You can do it. You do it.
[42:31.060 --> 42:31.440]  I don't care.
[42:32.860 --> 42:34.320]  Yeah, the fuck do I care? You do it.
[42:35.720 --> 42:36.080]  No!
[42:36.080 --> 42:37.060]  Look, it's fine.
[42:40.480 --> 42:41.740]  Oh, my God.
[42:41.760 --> 42:43.140]  It comes so fast.
[42:43.300 --> 42:44.500]  You probably gotta get on top of it.
[42:44.860 --> 42:47.240]  We're building left and right.
[42:47.360 --> 42:48.580]  We gotta build vertical.
[42:50.900 --> 42:52.320]  Can you run along the top of it?
[42:53.320 --> 42:54.040]  Let's find out.
[42:54.100 --> 42:54.880]  Like Tom Cruise?
[42:55.620 --> 42:56.000]  Yeah.
[43:02.230 --> 43:02.990]  Oh, no.
[43:03.630 --> 43:04.310]  I'm fucked.
[43:05.790 --> 43:07.130]  Okay, let's do a test.
[43:09.450 --> 43:10.950]  What the f...
[43:10.950 --> 43:12.270]  What happened? How are we doing this?
[43:13.430 --> 43:15.130]  I'm on your head, but you're on the ceiling.
[43:15.590 --> 43:16.910]  You killed me!
[43:17.030 --> 43:18.370]  You please threw me out!
[43:19.330 --> 43:19.490]  What?
[43:21.030 --> 43:23.290]  We jumped on each other's head in the sky.
[43:23.530 --> 43:24.670]  That was crazy.
[43:25.570 --> 43:27.430]  We got, like, attached to the top.
[43:28.490 --> 43:29.170]  That's crazy.
[43:29.350 --> 43:30.650]  We couldn't do that again if we tried.
[43:31.210 --> 43:32.070]  No, absolutely not.
[43:32.850 --> 43:33.370]  All right.
[43:33.910 --> 43:35.030]  I'm going the distance, baby.
[43:35.030 --> 43:35.870]  You should try.
[43:40.890 --> 43:42.010]  That's hilarious.
[43:42.410 --> 43:43.170]  Oops.
[43:43.270 --> 43:43.670]  Get the coin.
[43:45.110 --> 43:46.150]  Damn it.
[43:46.710 --> 43:47.110]  You got the coin.
[43:49.270 --> 43:50.030]  No!
[43:53.250 --> 43:53.930]  No!
[43:54.470 --> 43:54.870]  Yes!
[43:55.250 --> 43:55.830]  Nice!
[43:57.310 --> 43:58.450]  Raccoon time, baby!
[43:59.770 --> 44:01.110]  Raccoon time, baby!
[44:02.130 --> 44:02.930]  That's a dam.
[44:08.920 --> 44:10.020]  Oh, what?
[44:10.700 --> 44:11.980]  It's put me in...
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.520]  I never could walk!
[44:15.080 --> 44:15.780]  Oh, no!
[44:16.040 --> 44:16.600]  Oh, no!
[44:17.980 --> 44:19.820]  Is whoever's in the back just screwed?
[44:20.460 --> 44:21.660]  Yes, you put that there.
[44:21.760 --> 44:22.460]  You didn't know that?
[44:22.580 --> 44:24.560]  No, that's the first time I've been there.
[44:25.300 --> 44:26.940]  Yeah, it sucks every time it's not you.
[44:30.860 --> 44:31.580]  Diamond knight.
[44:39.200 --> 44:40.260]  Oh, no, it's me again.
[44:42.720 --> 44:43.480]  Well, I'm dead.
[44:44.780 --> 44:46.000]  Get off me.
[44:47.740 --> 44:49.440]  Oh, you can run along the top?
[44:49.540 --> 44:51.100]  Yes! Amazing!
[44:54.400 --> 44:56.020]  Oh, wow, he got the coin.
[44:56.240 --> 44:57.080]  And then he got hit.
[44:58.060 --> 44:58.340]  Oh.
[45:00.800 --> 45:02.180]  Oh, my God.
[45:02.680 --> 45:03.620]  This is great.
[45:03.700 --> 45:04.640]  This is the best level ever.
[45:04.880 --> 45:05.940]  This is really good.
[45:07.800 --> 45:09.560]  Whoa, whoa.
[45:09.560 --> 45:09.740]  Oh.
[45:21.710 --> 45:22.670]  I'm stuck.
[45:26.540 --> 45:27.020]  Car.
[45:27.160 --> 45:27.440]  Shit.
[45:27.920 --> 45:28.400]  Shit.
[45:30.520 --> 45:33.160]  Geoff's got this now.
[45:33.500 --> 45:34.460]  Come on, Geoff, you got it.
[45:34.520 --> 45:35.800]  Just don't go slow. You're going too slow.
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.380]  Oh, no.
[45:37.740 --> 45:38.420]  Keep jumping, Geoff.
[45:39.300 --> 45:39.780]  No!
[45:41.840 --> 45:42.580]  Go, Geoff, go!
[45:42.940 --> 45:43.400]  Yeah!
[45:46.920 --> 45:47.400]  Wow.
[45:47.400 --> 45:49.300]  Oh, and he's in the lead now.
[45:49.360 --> 45:50.860]  And Gavin's the underdog because he sucks.
[45:50.960 --> 45:51.620]  That's awesome.
[45:52.160 --> 45:53.940]  Well, it's a 5-0-1. We gotta go.
[45:55.160 --> 45:56.040]  It's 4-45.
[45:56.460 --> 45:56.980]  Damn it.
[45:57.920 --> 45:59.280]  Probably the perfect time to be 5-0-1.
[46:05.630 --> 46:06.530]  No, no, no, no!
[46:08.610 --> 46:10.150]  Damn it, Geoff. You suck.
[46:15.560 --> 46:15.940]  First!
[46:16.440 --> 46:17.200]  Good job.
[46:19.840 --> 46:20.600]  You idiot.
[46:20.600 --> 46:22.800]  Yeah, it is electrified all the time.
[46:22.940 --> 46:24.000]  Oh, that's crazy!
[46:24.180 --> 46:25.000]  That's so weird.
[46:25.440 --> 46:27.280]  That's so nuts. How strange.
[46:28.100 --> 46:29.540]  That's so fucking nuts.
[46:29.740 --> 46:31.580]  That's crazy. I can't believe nobody knew that.
[46:31.660 --> 46:34.460]  I mean, you said it, but I thought
[46:34.460 --> 46:35.160]  maybe you were wrong.
[46:36.800 --> 46:37.880]  Doesn't happen that often.
[46:46.180 --> 46:46.840]  Fuck me.
[46:51.500 --> 46:52.320]  Get off of you.
[46:53.060 --> 46:53.880]  Who put this here?
[46:53.940 --> 46:54.800]  Who put this up here?
[47:02.660 --> 47:03.500]  Who's the...
[47:03.500 --> 47:04.800]  You're in a hell loop.
[47:08.340 --> 47:10.100]  Who put this up here?
[47:12.060 --> 47:13.660]  Now, there's gotta be a way to get that coin.
[47:13.760 --> 47:14.600]  I need that coin.
[47:15.240 --> 47:18.180]  Yeah, you have to go down, get it, get back up, and go over.
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.940]  You better be quick, though.
[47:20.440 --> 47:21.200]  Yeah, check this out.
[47:21.980 --> 47:27.920]  Shit. I balled it.
[47:29.600 --> 47:30.880]  Just stand in there.
[47:31.500 --> 47:32.780]  Just stand in there.
[47:32.780 --> 47:34.200]  There's gotta be a way to do it.
[47:34.460 --> 47:36.880]  Okay. Here it is.
[47:37.020 --> 47:38.760]  Here it is. You gotta go down and get it.
[47:38.760 --> 47:40.020]  You gotta go down and get it.
[47:40.080 --> 47:40.340]  Shit.
[47:42.140 --> 47:42.960]  It's tense.
[47:43.980 --> 47:44.900]  It's very good.
[47:45.960 --> 47:48.060]  You gotta go down and get it if you want it.
[47:48.240 --> 47:49.180]  Oh, shit!
[47:49.860 --> 47:52.560]  Oh, my God. Amazing.
[47:53.100 --> 47:54.300]  Wow. Doesn't matter.
[47:55.120 --> 47:56.000]  Come on!
[48:00.400 --> 48:01.280]  Congratulations, Raccoon.
[48:01.280 --> 48:03.740]  Dude, that's great. I wanna play that level again.
[48:03.800 --> 48:04.340]  Yeah, let's do it again.
[48:04.740 --> 48:07.520]  Oh, God. Yeah, that's a good one.
[48:08.100 --> 48:09.020]  Let me turn on a mod.
[48:09.780 --> 48:10.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:13.180 --> 48:15.640]  I'm gonna go over here and change my handicap Andrew style
[48:15.640 --> 48:18.000]  and then be really confused about why I did that.
[48:31.040 --> 48:31.440]  Frictionless?
[48:31.740 --> 48:34.280]  What about...
[48:39.580 --> 48:39.980]  Ghosts!
[48:40.380 --> 48:41.140]  What does that mean?
[48:41.440 --> 48:44.800]  When you die, you can just become a shovey little annoying bastard.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.160]  Oh, that's...
[48:46.160 --> 48:47.480]  Oh, for this level? That's great.
[48:47.520 --> 48:48.720]  That's gonna be great for Geoff.
[48:50.080 --> 48:50.780]  Get on.
[48:50.960 --> 48:51.720]  You can't see me.
[48:58.010 --> 48:59.650]  Gavin's not gonna let you come over and play pinball.
[49:04.230 --> 49:04.870]  Hey, guys.
[49:04.950 --> 49:06.410]  The track's always electrified.
[49:07.890 --> 49:09.310]  No, I don't think so.
[49:13.740 --> 49:16.260]  Ooh, early builds going crazy right now.
[49:19.670 --> 49:20.550]  Holy shit.
[49:20.570 --> 49:21.650]  That's a scythe.
[49:21.770 --> 49:22.590]  You made a scythe.
[49:22.770 --> 49:24.650]  That's great. Love that.
[49:24.890 --> 49:25.790]  Oh, no!
[49:26.530 --> 49:30.090]  Can I get to the end before...
[49:34.830 --> 49:36.070]  Wait, Geoff was alive?
[49:36.970 --> 49:37.390]  Was I?
[49:37.810 --> 49:38.210]  No.
[49:38.490 --> 49:39.490]  I don't think so.
[49:40.390 --> 49:40.990]  I'm pretty dead.
[49:42.490 --> 49:44.810]  Okay, I guess I'll get someone else.
[49:46.930 --> 49:48.070]  Oh, that's a good one.
[49:48.070 --> 49:48.950]  I like this one.
[49:50.870 --> 49:51.430]  Oops!
[49:51.610 --> 49:53.850]  Oh! Ah, sticky!
[49:57.990 --> 49:59.610]  Gotta keep getting fucking zapped.
[50:00.810 --> 50:02.010]  It's always electrified.
[50:17.950 --> 50:19.430]  You know, we gotta get
[50:19.430 --> 50:20.310]  something a little further out.
[50:21.930 --> 50:23.030]  Double scythe.
[50:23.610 --> 50:24.090]  Ha!
[50:26.510 --> 50:27.470]  Oh, shit!
[50:33.860 --> 50:34.820]  There's just...
[50:36.560 --> 50:38.380]  We refuse to build anything
[50:38.380 --> 50:40.020]  that will let us finish this.
[50:46.000 --> 50:46.980]  Somebody said it sounds like
[50:46.980 --> 50:48.440]  there's Billy Joel playing in the background.
[50:52.680 --> 50:54.840]  Why did I get this? I don't want to blow anything up.
[50:54.840 --> 50:56.780]  No, it's perfect. Everything's perfect.
[50:58.960 --> 51:01.000]  That was the only way we can win!
[51:01.040 --> 51:02.320]  The only way.
[51:09.140 --> 51:10.300]  Oh, come on!
[51:10.420 --> 51:11.200]  That was in the front.
[51:12.120 --> 51:13.240]  Oh, god damn it!
[51:14.960 --> 51:16.360]  Now, Geoff, imagine if you had that
[51:16.360 --> 51:17.460]  thing that could help you win.
[51:17.600 --> 51:19.500]  Oh my god, why did you wait for the...
[51:19.500 --> 51:20.680]  You could have waited for the train.
[51:21.040 --> 51:24.380]  Yeah, but I don't think you can move
[51:24.380 --> 51:26.320]  fast enough to...
[51:26.320 --> 51:27.780]  You can? Yeah, I don't think so.
[51:27.820 --> 51:29.880]  I don't think you can jump fast enough and move forward fast enough for it.
[51:30.060 --> 51:30.500]  Watch this.
[51:34.820 --> 51:36.380]  I don't want you going up here.
[51:37.340 --> 51:38.060]  You suck!
[51:38.320 --> 51:38.700]  What do you mean?
[51:40.020 --> 51:40.740]  Oh, shit!
[51:45.240 --> 51:45.600]  No!
[51:50.660 --> 51:52.480]  That's an ugly start now, I'll be honest.
[52:04.420 --> 52:05.360]  Oh, you're a genius.
[52:07.440 --> 52:08.140]  Oh, god.
[52:08.860 --> 52:09.960]  You're a hell monster.
[52:12.220 --> 52:13.240]  No, you...
[52:16.140 --> 52:16.620]  Motherfucker.
[52:18.280 --> 52:20.060]  Oh, I had it!
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.080]  Oh, Geoff, you suck!
[52:22.120 --> 52:22.760]  I hate you!
[52:25.840 --> 52:28.060]  I like when I'm a ghost, it makes me look
[52:28.060 --> 52:29.000]  bald with a wig.
[52:30.300 --> 52:30.900]  Soon enough.
[52:32.400 --> 52:33.480]  You think I'll go wig?
[52:33.760 --> 52:34.100]  I might.
[52:37.620 --> 52:38.740]  Dude, wigs are cool.
[52:42.500 --> 52:43.360]  Damn it.
[52:45.220 --> 52:46.340]  That's all you, man.
[52:46.700 --> 52:49.500]  Oh, you jumped on me
[52:49.500 --> 52:51.020]  as a ghost and it fucked me.
[52:53.260 --> 52:54.300]  Jesus Christ.
[53:07.010 --> 53:08.050]  I fucking
[53:08.050 --> 53:09.310]  moved it one too far down.
[53:09.830 --> 53:12.010]  I meant to hit it and it just didn't go.
[53:12.910 --> 53:13.530]  Move, Geoff!
[53:14.290 --> 53:14.950]  What's up?
[53:14.950 --> 53:16.510]  You keep killing me!
[53:17.550 --> 53:19.430]  Yeah, he's been known to do that.
[53:21.330 --> 53:22.690]  Oh, god damn it!
[53:24.910 --> 53:26.210]  Will Geoff make it?
[53:26.290 --> 53:27.810]  Will he blow it?
[53:29.890 --> 53:31.150]  In the black hole?
[53:31.170 --> 53:31.710]  Oh, he made it!
[53:32.010 --> 53:33.090]  No way!
[53:34.730 --> 53:35.030]  Unbelievable!
[53:36.490 --> 53:37.650]  That's bullshit.
[53:38.090 --> 53:38.590]  Wow.
[53:39.710 --> 53:41.890]  I would call it bull awesome.
[53:41.890 --> 53:42.270]  Bull awesome?
[53:43.910 --> 53:45.550]  You'd call it bull awesome?
[53:45.810 --> 53:46.090]  Yeah.
[53:51.750 --> 53:53.250]  Damn it, there's a flamethrower there now.
[53:54.330 --> 53:55.930]  Oh, hey, there's a flamethrower up there now.
[53:55.970 --> 53:56.230]  Watch out.
[53:57.130 --> 53:57.630]  Damn it.
[53:59.090 --> 54:00.830]  Oh, my body looks messed.
[54:04.130 --> 54:05.730]  Oh, god. This is tough.
[54:06.730 --> 54:07.750]  It is 454.
[54:08.210 --> 54:09.770]  Guys, we're getting on to 501.
[54:09.770 --> 54:10.870]  I'm feeling good about it.
[54:11.010 --> 54:12.590]  What a week it's been.
[54:13.590 --> 54:16.470]  Filmed a lot of regulation content this week, I feel like.
[54:16.710 --> 54:16.930]  Yep.
[54:17.370 --> 54:18.170]  Did some podcasts.
[54:18.690 --> 54:19.530]  A podcast.
[54:21.210 --> 54:23.810]  Did two supplementals.
[54:23.990 --> 54:24.970]  Damn it, Geoff!
[54:25.290 --> 54:27.430]  A bunch of other supplementals.
[54:27.970 --> 54:29.550]  Eric's audio's fucked up on two of them.
[54:30.030 --> 54:31.630]  Oh, my god, dude. No kidding.
[54:32.870 --> 54:33.750]  What a headache.
[54:34.770 --> 54:35.390]  For Nick.
[54:35.390 --> 54:35.470]  For Nick.
[54:40.900 --> 54:41.340]  Yes!
[54:44.500 --> 54:45.540]  Oh, this is great.
[54:46.720 --> 54:48.160]  This is how we do it.
[54:58.760 --> 54:59.200]  You...
[55:02.020 --> 55:03.580]  Yeah? How's the underneath of that?
[55:06.760 --> 55:08.300]  Get those coins. Get the lead.
[55:08.680 --> 55:09.360]  Oh, fuck me.
[55:09.780 --> 55:10.700]  I need those coins.
[55:14.700 --> 55:14.940]  Oh!
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.660]  You idiot. You idiot.
[55:17.960 --> 55:18.820]  You fool.
[55:19.880 --> 55:22.220]  The greed got me. The two-coin greed.
[55:23.880 --> 55:24.680]  Last turn!
[55:26.300 --> 55:27.100]  Oh, shit.
[55:27.840 --> 55:28.360]  Oh, dear.
[55:28.980 --> 55:30.360]  That was a lot of bombs.
[55:31.940 --> 55:34.020]  No! My creation!
[55:34.620 --> 55:36.780]  Yes. I want a shot
[55:36.780 --> 55:37.720]  at getting this done.
[55:38.100 --> 55:39.720]  Okay. Let's do it.
[55:40.340 --> 55:41.280]  Last one. There's a raw neck.
[55:41.280 --> 55:41.620]  Oh.
[55:45.880 --> 55:46.320]  Shit.
[55:55.130 --> 55:56.530]  Don't fucking black hole!
[55:56.790 --> 55:56.990]  No!
[56:00.190 --> 56:01.850]  Damn it. He trapped me, too.
[56:02.070 --> 56:02.910]  The trap point.
[56:03.650 --> 56:05.210]  You're the ultimate raccoon, Eric.
[56:05.650 --> 56:07.210]  My hat's off to you. Congratulations.
[56:07.210 --> 56:08.030]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[56:08.770 --> 56:09.230]  Oh, no.
[56:12.190 --> 56:13.090]  It's not 5-0-1 yet.
[56:13.790 --> 56:14.630]  Wanna do it one more time?
[56:14.830 --> 56:15.410]  Final round.
[56:15.410 --> 56:16.510]  Different map?
[56:17.490 --> 56:19.030]  Sure. Let's unlock something on Waterfall.
[56:20.010 --> 56:20.650]  Oh, please.
[56:21.330 --> 56:23.010]  And Geoff just unlocked this map.
[56:23.650 --> 56:23.930]  That's true.
[56:28.350 --> 56:29.870]  You tried so hard.
[56:31.250 --> 56:32.550]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[56:33.790 --> 56:35.530]  Whoops. Why'd I want that?
[56:35.850 --> 56:36.430]  Idiot.
[56:41.620 --> 56:43.500]  Geoff. What? Why?
[56:44.080 --> 56:45.320]  Good god damn.
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.220]  What's wrong with you?
[56:50.100 --> 56:51.340]  There we go.
[56:52.520 --> 56:53.760]  We're not gonna be able to do it
[56:53.760 --> 56:54.960]  with that placement.
[57:05.400 --> 57:06.640]  Well, here we go.
[57:07.620 --> 57:08.760]  I didn't want that.
[57:09.040 --> 57:09.440]  Hold on.
[57:17.620 --> 57:18.360]  Get me up there.
[57:18.940 --> 57:19.700]  Get me up there.
[57:19.700 --> 57:20.720]  Ow.
[57:23.340 --> 57:23.940]  Yes!
[57:24.360 --> 57:24.680]  No!
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.680]  How'd you do that?
[57:26.820 --> 57:28.080]  I jumped on your little head.
[57:28.640 --> 57:29.700]  God damn it.
[57:30.880 --> 57:32.680]  Thanks to your forehead, I made it.
[57:32.860 --> 57:33.320]  Fuck.
[57:34.900 --> 57:35.200]  Ah!
[57:37.020 --> 57:38.220]  Watch out.
[57:40.140 --> 57:41.440]  Wonder what that would have looked like
[57:41.440 --> 57:43.780]  from my perspective of just the top of an elephant's head.
[57:45.920 --> 57:47.020]  See the trunk.
[57:50.640 --> 57:51.080]  Alright.
[57:51.180 --> 57:53.240]  That's all I need, so time to sabotage.
[57:58.830 --> 58:00.770]  Geoff, we need something to jump on on the right.
[58:01.050 --> 58:01.470]  Okay.
[58:03.230 --> 58:05.030]  At the top, not the bottom.
[58:08.670 --> 58:10.410]  You got hit on my screen.
[58:12.530 --> 58:12.970]  Nah, I'm in.
[58:13.150 --> 58:13.190]  Oh!
[58:14.710 --> 58:16.370]  Hoisted by my own pitard.
[58:17.650 --> 58:18.790]  He's my favorite Star Trek
[58:19.370 --> 58:19.650]  captain.
[58:21.690 --> 58:23.190]  Someone get under me.
[58:23.290 --> 58:24.090]  Nope.
[58:55.740 --> 58:57.420]  Oh shit,
[58:57.480 --> 58:58.780]  it hits the water and dies?
[59:00.280 --> 59:01.020]  Oops.
[59:01.460 --> 59:02.000]  Oh!
[59:02.200 --> 59:03.520]  Go Geoff!
[59:03.740 --> 59:04.880]  What a move!
[59:05.920 --> 59:07.220]  What a move!
[59:08.780 --> 59:10.040]  I think Eric's lie
[59:10.040 --> 59:11.060]  killed me.
[59:14.120 --> 59:14.920]  What hits
[59:14.920 --> 59:15.680]  the water and dies?
[59:16.240 --> 59:18.420]  I watched the plane get all wavy.
[59:18.520 --> 59:19.400]  I thought it hit the water.
[59:19.600 --> 59:20.780]  I thought it hit the water and died.
[59:20.980 --> 59:23.460]  You made me jump off it before the water and it carried on.
[59:23.920 --> 59:26.040]  Oh no, what are we going to do?
[59:38.660 --> 59:39.640]  Go get all of it.
[59:40.140 --> 59:40.720]  Go Geoff, go!
[59:41.180 --> 59:41.700]  Go Geoff, go!
[59:42.600 --> 59:43.960]  Level discovered for Geoff!
[59:47.120 --> 59:47.520]  Wow.
[59:47.520 --> 59:47.860]  Wow.
[59:49.440 --> 59:49.960]  459.
[59:50.980 --> 59:51.980]  We're so close.
[59:53.180 --> 59:53.700]  What?
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.060]  Try to time
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.040]  that just right, it didn't work.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.380]  Oh damn it Geoff.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.640]  I didn't see that.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.080]  You idiot.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.040]  That was dog
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:20.740]  shit timing.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:21.760]  Oh!
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.920]  Yeah, let's
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.620]  make it slippery.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.100]  That's what we need.
[01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:04.650]  Oh no!
[01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:06.850]  I went around it, I did a full circle.
[01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:08.170]  501!
[01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:09.850]  It is 501.
[01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:11.630]  Best time of the week baby.
[01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.970]  Alright, I guess that's it for us.
[01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:16.210]  Geoff wins.
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.330]  Alright baby, we gotta get this done.
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.310]  What if from now on we just hit 0F4
[01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.250]  at 501?
[01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:23.930]  Insane mode.
[01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.790]  Guess we gotta see who the ultimate
[01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.490]  whatever is.
[01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.150]  Oh!
[01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:37.110]  Oh what the fuck!
[01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:40.670]  Went too far
[01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:42.210]  boys. Quitting time.
[01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.270]  501 guys, thanks so much for watching us.
[01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:46.150]  We're getting close to being the end here.
[01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.630]  I think there's only a couple rounds left.
[01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:50.050]  Can't stop now, we care too much.
[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.190]  Unfortunately it's
[01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.490]  true.
[01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:56.030]  We'll stop unless there's a level 50 hype train
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.230]  and then I guess we'll...
[01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.470]  Good lord.
[01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:03.010]  Animal.
[01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.490]  We all are.
[01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.910]  No!
[01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:10.590]  Damn it!
[01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:11.990]  Yeah baby!
[01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:13.690]  Uh...
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.220]  Wow
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.680]  Geoff, look at the moves!
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.360]  Damn it!
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.120]  Dude, I'm a bouncy little elephant.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.780]  Oh my god!
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160]  It's getting close, three turns left.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.660]  This could be it.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.360]  This could be it.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.380]  Is it it? We don't know, but it could be.
[01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:49.990]  Come here, come here
[01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:51.150]  you little rat, come here!
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:53.430]  Sorry, I can't hear you.
[01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:54.570]  I'm all the way up here.
[01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:56.670]  I'm all the way
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:57.690]  I guess you guys missed it.
[01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.070]  I'm all the way up here.
[01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.450]  You gotta kill Geoff though
[01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:03.370]  because otherwise he wins.
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:06.790]  Raise your monyehas in the chat.
[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:08.250]  Raise your monyehas.
[01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.010]  Tackle him!
[01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:13.810]  Fly elephant!
[01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:17.790]  We did it.
[01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.410]  Geoff wins
[01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:21.910]  it's unbelievable...
[01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.810]  Wait, why'd you die?
[01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:25.910]  You just jumped out of your body.
[01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:28.230]  I'm the ultimate elephant and I'm dead.
[01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.030]  You just jumped out of your skin.
[01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:32.310]  Wow.
[01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.770]  Alright guys, thank you very much.
[01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:37.090]  Appreciate you guys coming through.
[01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:38.690]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.190]  Watch this VOD on Tuesday
[01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.650]  if you're watching this on Tuesday.
[01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:44.770]  Come back through on Friday
[01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:46.470]  4pm central.
[01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.790]  Guys, we'll see you next time.
[01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:51.890]  Regulatrion.com
[01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.270]  Nice.
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:55.070]  Geoff.sucks
[01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.570]  There's some good shit up on the Patreon.
[01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.010]  Bye!
[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:03.610]  I said my piece.
