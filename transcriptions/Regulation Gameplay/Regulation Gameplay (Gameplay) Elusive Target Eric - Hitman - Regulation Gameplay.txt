[00:00.540 --> 00:04.160]  Hello and welcome to another Hitman 3 elusive target
[00:04.160 --> 00:09.880]  I'm here with Gavin as always and also Eric for the first time. I'm really excited guys
[00:09.880 --> 00:14.400]  This is an idea that I'm like, I want to watch somebody play hitman. I never get to watch you guys play hitman
[00:14.400 --> 00:16.460]  I know there's an elusive target going on
[00:16.460 --> 00:20.900]  I figured this would be a cool way to see exactly what this is. Do we get to do that now?
[00:21.160 --> 00:25.080]  We could just say hey, I want to see Eric play X and then you have to play it
[00:25.080 --> 00:29.340]  But this was like a thing that you guys were already doing wasn't it? That's true. Yeah
[00:29.340 --> 00:34.160]  We've done two episodes. Typically, we only do celebrities. This guy kind of looks like Vin Diesel. I feel like it's close enough
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.380]  Grumpy like if I guess if there was a game that I did something for before and you wanted to see it
[00:41.860 --> 00:46.400]  But also maybe we do a thing where you we just from now on we go like Geoff. I want
[00:47.160 --> 00:51.820]  Want you to play Ninja Turtles Turtles in time now and then he has to do it
[00:54.400 --> 00:54.800]  Oh
[00:56.060 --> 00:59.320]  Cool that's it. You got a lot of blood. This is do you know how elusive targets work?
[00:59.520 --> 01:02.780]  You're just supposed to like kill a guy right but like you only get like one shot at it
[01:03.580 --> 01:03.980]  exactly
[01:05.060 --> 01:09.840]  No saves one shot. And once you start doing objectives, you can't even quit out
[01:10.840 --> 01:11.240]  What?
[01:12.720 --> 01:13.120]  Yeah
[01:14.640 --> 01:17.820]  Oh, wow, it's got a figure out on the fly
[01:18.720 --> 01:21.540]  Execute get out. No. Wow, that's crazy
[01:21.540 --> 01:23.260]  Okay, so we got to kill Sully
[01:24.320 --> 01:24.720]  Bowden
[01:27.040 --> 01:28.160]  What you what you bringing
[01:29.360 --> 01:34.480]  You know, I got my my silenced gun got my coins got a lockpick. Is this your pretty tip?
[01:34.680 --> 01:38.940]  Is that like your typical sort of like? Yeah, that's kind of my standard thing
[01:38.940 --> 01:45.620]  Does this I almost never use the pickups even though it should does this level have the electronic locks? I
[01:45.620 --> 01:47.540]  Don't know. I think it's the same level
[01:48.340 --> 01:55.000]  That the last elusive target the JCVD one was on. Oh, yeah the outside of it. Oh, wow
[01:56.660 --> 02:00.740]  We crushed him between some walls. Yeah, this way it goes
[02:02.380 --> 02:05.060]  I don't you know what? I'm not even gonna bring it like
[02:06.300 --> 02:07.720]  Hitman is such a
[02:07.720 --> 02:13.920]  Game that I've never I don't think I've ever played in my life that has like a whole community of people so devoted to it
[02:13.920 --> 02:16.380]  And then does like this elusive target stuff. It's crazy
[02:16.380 --> 02:21.860]  Hitman is one of those franchises that somehow I've been a part of from the very beginning like I played
[02:22.840 --> 02:29.660]  Codename 47 when it was new dude. I had no idea it turned into such a franchise same with GTA. I played GTA 1
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.060]  I got converted because the hitman 2 demo was on a demo disk or the PlayStation magazine
[02:40.020 --> 02:41.840]  Original hitman 2 song on assassin
[02:43.880 --> 02:46.200]  You know like the names of all of them, huh
[02:47.120 --> 02:49.240]  Yeah, and they've all got the same name
[02:50.980 --> 02:54.800]  We've had hitman 1 2 & 3 like twice at this point, that's great
[02:56.600 --> 02:57.900]  Can't forget about blood money
[02:59.380 --> 03:00.860]  Absolution you mean hitman 4 & 5
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.200]  And and where the movies line up Christ
[03:09.780 --> 03:12.260]  Movies are weird because they put the game in the movies
[03:12.260 --> 03:15.840]  So technically the video game exists in the same world as the hitman does
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.700]  It's very strange. Oh, that's bizarre
[03:18.140 --> 03:20.320]  Didn't they all like fight with swords at one point?
[03:21.460 --> 03:22.200]  classic hitman
[03:24.180 --> 03:27.740]  Maybe I don't I only saw the first one and I don't remember much about it now
[03:27.740 --> 03:30.260]  I said a Desmond shows up in the last act as the villain
[03:30.260 --> 03:36.650]  Yeah, now the first one with Timothy Oliphant or whatever or okay, but didn't they like make another one?
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.720]  They did and it's like I tried to watch it and I tapped out after 10 minutes
[03:42.220 --> 03:43.520]  Not hit me oh
[03:44.600 --> 03:51.660]  That's brutal. It's yeah, it's insane. It was like this is just not you could have put any skin on this tail
[03:57.140 --> 03:58.020]  Did you
[03:59.060 --> 04:04.820]  Did you look at a picture of him on the objective? Sometimes? It's a hit. Oh my god
[04:04.820 --> 04:09.520]  You pulled a gun. I accidentally pulled my gun out. That would have been a really fat. That was crazy
[04:09.520 --> 04:12.980]  Okay, just walking around just whip this thing out
[04:15.040 --> 04:17.580]  Figure out where to go. So these aren't timed or anything
[04:17.580 --> 04:22.720]  It's just sort of like this open-world mission where it's like you have to try to figure out what to do. Yeah
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.560]  Yep. I mean there are timed modes, but a lot of the fun of this game is just
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.220]  Listening to people talk and like exploring and figuring stuff out. Oh
[04:32.220 --> 04:35.260]  This is like so not my style of game. This is very interesting
[04:36.640 --> 04:36.960]  113
[04:38.620 --> 04:42.860]  No, it's not it. What was it? Help me. Yeah, you think
[04:48.710 --> 04:49.350]  Zero one
[04:52.390 --> 04:57.910]  Zero one, okay. Zero one eighteen. I don't know what code that's for. It's a thing that you're gonna have to like run into later.
[04:59.290 --> 05:02.030]  Oh shit. Did they open it? Zero one one eight.
[05:03.110 --> 05:03.750]  They're in
[05:05.990 --> 05:08.350]  Do you need to be in? I don't know if I'm supposed to. I don't know
[05:08.930 --> 05:09.650]  I'm trespassing
[05:15.800 --> 05:20.080]  Oh, did you need to? I don't know but I want us close. Okay
[05:25.500 --> 05:32.040]  Nobody look. That just felt like a really bold move. I don't know anything about this. That felt very very bold
[05:32.040 --> 05:35.120]  It was pretty wild. I would say you could have got in there without doing that. Okay
[05:36.540 --> 05:38.540]  Because a lot of the time when you get into a...
[05:39.640 --> 05:45.980]  Oh yeah, it's a street guard outfit. I'm gonna fucking I'm gonna go in there and they're gonna be like, what are you doing in here?
[05:46.940 --> 05:50.980]  You're you're a street guy. Yeah, and a lot of time when you break into a highly secure area
[05:50.980 --> 05:53.460]  You'll find an outfit for that area in there somewhere
[05:59.470 --> 06:02.670]  Probably a outfit. Oh, is that like a pickup?
[06:04.310 --> 06:08.810]  You gotta look at it with your cam. I can hack it. Oh wow
[06:10.990 --> 06:15.370]  Give me that screwdriver. I'm really learning that I don't know anything about Hitman
[06:16.330 --> 06:21.250]  You should play him. This is fat. No, this is this is I'm not smart enough or patient enough to play this game
[06:21.970 --> 06:25.850]  You don't have to be I play it. Yeah at some point it's gonna go
[06:27.230 --> 06:30.710]  Yeah, you're gonna see I'm just gonna go full auto
[06:31.490 --> 06:39.670]  There are different levels of Hitman and there's it's definitely okay to have everything go wrong and then just machine gun your way out
[06:39.670 --> 06:43.890]  But it's deliberately quite a hard shooter. Like there's not a lot of auto aim
[06:44.890 --> 06:46.570]  So it's ill-advised to go
[06:47.630 --> 06:53.630]  Run and gun, but can't be done. Hmm. Wow. It's a lot of people. Wow, that is so many people
[06:54.130 --> 06:57.690]  That door opened. Oh my god. Oh
[06:58.430 --> 06:59.770]  God oh god
[07:00.550 --> 07:07.790]  He's like, why is the photocopier going? Who makes copies? Are you gonna go for the screwdriver throw? Oh, yeah, you know it
[07:10.630 --> 07:15.050]  Wow, oh my god, you got over the shoulder. Oh, no, it's the back of his head
[07:20.890 --> 07:26.310]  I've always been convinced that you should be able to bring a mop into the map so you can sweep the blood up
[07:26.310 --> 07:30.930]  Yeah, no kidding. Oh, oh shit. I forgot to turn it off. I forgot to turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off
[07:30.930 --> 07:34.190]  Turn it off. Oh my god. I
[07:34.190 --> 07:34.810]  think it's
[07:36.130 --> 07:39.790]  I'm not gonna bother with the gun or the blood. They don't care. Oh my god about the gun
[07:47.110 --> 07:47.670]  Don't turn
[07:49.370 --> 07:49.930]  Oh
[08:07.260 --> 08:13.000]  Okay, I'm really learning that I don't know anything about hitman this this is not what I thought hitman was
[08:15.020 --> 08:15.360]  I
[08:15.360 --> 08:17.580]  Destroyed the face. Oh my god
[08:18.560 --> 08:21.080]  Could you still quit if you want because you haven't done an objective?
[08:22.160 --> 08:27.120]  Maybe even I'm not going to locked in locked. Oh my god. I think I think it would be just fine if you wanted to quit
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.640]  We don't even know if you're in the right area, yeah, I'm true. Oh my god
[08:42.730 --> 08:43.790]  Annihilating those guys
[08:46.370 --> 08:48.720]  Hey, it's not out. You gotta punch it one more time
[08:50.390 --> 08:52.470]  Yeah, yeah, but I'm worried about that yeah, you got punched
[08:54.290 --> 08:55.870]  This is crazy
[08:56.990 --> 09:02.950]  Okay, everyone's dead. That's in this area happened. Oh, man. You only have an unconscious witness
[09:02.950 --> 09:06.390]  I think if you get rid of them, you'll be you'll be in the clear
[09:07.670 --> 09:08.090]  Yep
[09:09.590 --> 09:12.850]  That insane so this disguise isn't even blown now
[09:15.810 --> 09:20.450]  How how cuz no cuz it didn't he got rid of all the witnesses of that little of it
[09:24.770 --> 09:26.270]  Yeah, this is
[09:27.610 --> 09:33.210]  This is crazy. Yeah, I think I'm in the security area. I think I can like you think so
[09:36.530 --> 09:39.450]  There's a vent you can hack a vent yeah
[09:39.450 --> 09:39.550]  Yeah
[09:44.400 --> 09:49.480]  Wow, how did these people just lounging around at that they just chillin baby not hear any of that
[09:52.140 --> 09:59.240]  Act normal, what are they talking about?
[10:06.900 --> 10:10.360]  I don't need to worry about getting my pockets checked. I'm a security
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.140]  I'm so glad. I'm so glad we decided to do this today. That's great
[10:23.680 --> 10:26.720]  I have to use my dongle. I
[10:27.420 --> 10:30.860]  Thought I had a dongle that would open that no you did you can't hack those without the dongle
[10:31.800 --> 10:35.880]  Okay, there are some like dongle specific. Let you probably can't get into that red room yet
[10:37.080 --> 10:38.380]  All right this one
[10:38.380 --> 10:41.380]  Try it steer to you do you have a tear to
[10:47.500 --> 10:49.760]  Okay, you're a tier one kind of guy at the moment
[10:52.420 --> 10:56.880]  If we had security clearance regulation what tears would we all have
[10:58.140 --> 11:01.800]  We'd all have to start with president. Yeah, we'd all have to start with bog standard
[11:02.900 --> 11:04.900]  Just the regular tier one access
[11:05.620 --> 11:09.780]  Huh, I think Nick would have to have the highest clearance
[11:10.920 --> 11:11.360]  Yeah
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.580]  Yeah, he does he does so much back-end work that none of us
[11:15.580 --> 11:18.740]  Yeah, know how to do that. He has to be the one to do that
[11:23.150 --> 11:30.490]  This is the room where you can dump poison into the air conditioning and gas everyone. Oh cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's good
[11:31.170 --> 11:32.570]  Will he let me know?
[11:35.010 --> 11:37.450]  I'm going back here. I'm going this other way. It's your one. I'm it's your one guy
[11:40.470 --> 11:42.570]  Did he say get out my face, yeah
[11:43.870 --> 11:45.930]  Yeah, it was just it's like a bomb vent
[11:46.970 --> 11:47.290]  Okay
[11:48.090 --> 11:51.150]  We'll go up and to the other side and I could probably drop down somewhere over here
[11:51.150 --> 11:56.530]  Try I guess like you don't have to be inconspicuous like the whole time because you're just sort of like running around or whatever
[11:56.530 --> 11:59.570]  If I was working at this place and I just saw a guy start like running
[12:03.510 --> 12:04.010]  Oh
[12:10.880 --> 12:11.900]  I need the outfit
[12:16.250 --> 12:17.810]  And in here
[12:22.530 --> 12:26.410]  You're just like you're like a light jogging everywhere, it's so funny
[12:29.770 --> 12:31.390]  That used to get you
[12:31.390 --> 12:36.910]  To get your cover blown and probably a hitman to silent assassin if you were jogging around
[12:36.910 --> 12:40.490]  Oh, we start looking at you and your cover would be shit. That's funny
[12:40.610 --> 12:43.050]  But thankfully got rid of that another tier one
[12:44.550 --> 12:48.750]  Bummer. Yeah, but put them together here, too. Oh
[12:49.390 --> 12:51.330]  Get some duck they got duct tape around here
[12:57.830 --> 12:58.790]  I'm just hungry
[12:59.610 --> 13:03.290]  Got my lunch. Do you know if this is where you're supposed to be?
[13:05.030 --> 13:08.150]  Nope, I don't know where this guy is. Look at his picture
[13:09.250 --> 13:14.110]  How do I look at his picture again select he's outside
[13:26.730 --> 13:29.510]  That your assumption by the image yeah very clearly outside
[13:31.150 --> 13:35.290]  Does the image where does that indicate where they're at when you kill them? That's how I kill him
[13:36.290 --> 13:41.030]  Really? I had no idea. I mean, that's how I've always done it. It's never used that as a point of reference
[13:41.050 --> 13:44.830]  Seems to always be a clue where they might be. They usually have a patrol that goes through that picture
[13:48.290 --> 13:50.650]  Okay, well then I guess I'm gonna get out of here
[13:52.490 --> 13:56.610]  Yeah, but you just got tier 2 access maybe I just got tier 2 though
[13:57.510 --> 14:00.650]  Great point. I can't hack that with my fruit
[14:04.770 --> 14:08.990]  You can always leave a banana down here before you leave you just have someone have an accident
[14:10.150 --> 14:11.690]  Oh, do they slip on the bananas?
[14:13.830 --> 14:14.630]  That's fantastic
[14:16.810 --> 14:19.490]  There's a level as well you could you could put down a rake
[14:22.710 --> 14:23.510]  No way
[14:27.670 --> 14:29.130]  To both bumpers or something
[14:40.390 --> 14:43.950]  Okay, place. Hit Y. Okay, just hit the Y button
[14:46.190 --> 14:47.750]  Okay, there you go, they're both gone
[14:49.650 --> 14:54.410]  Where did my bananas go? Did you do the both bumpers thing? Yeah
[15:00.290 --> 15:05.910]  This doesn't have anything to do with killing the guy we're just trying to put a banana down. Oh
[15:05.910 --> 15:08.330]  God, this is awesome. Thirsty. Thank you
[15:10.850 --> 15:15.290]  We're getting out of here, I don't like it. The way to handle the banana is I don't trust this place. We're leaving
[15:16.310 --> 15:18.110]  And I'm an employee so I can exit this way
[15:20.250 --> 15:22.410]  Back to the streets. Oh, man
[15:25.330 --> 15:30.930]  Fuck. I don't know if I was seen or not. That was close. I think so
[15:34.510 --> 15:38.330]  Okay, I really don't remember the layout of the outside of this place
[15:40.670 --> 15:42.870]  Run around a little bit
[15:46.330 --> 15:47.710]  One of these buildings
[15:56.750 --> 16:02.870]  So Eric if this game isn't your speed I assume you never touched Splinter Cell and all that. No
[16:02.870 --> 16:04.770]  I watched a lot of Splinter Cell
[16:05.470 --> 16:09.470]  When I was younger had like go to like friends houses and like watch them play Splinter Cell and be like wow
[16:09.470 --> 16:12.050]  This was like really cool. It's like do you want to play? No
[16:15.790 --> 16:17.630]  I had a few games like that where I just
[16:18.390 --> 16:23.150]  Watched him. Right. Well, I I have so much fun just watching somebody play a game
[16:23.150 --> 16:26.930]  Like I I have a lot of enjoyment doing that
[16:28.390 --> 16:33.370]  Other people don't I definitely do and a game like this is a watching game not a playing game
[16:33.910 --> 16:34.330]  Hmm
[16:35.290 --> 16:35.710]  Yeah
[16:36.690 --> 16:41.810]  He's gonna go investigate. I get so frustrated so fast. This will knock him down, but not out I think
[16:55.110 --> 17:01.390]  You truly are the fruit ninja Andrew. Oh, yeah
[17:03.370 --> 17:04.450]  Fruit ninja needs this
[17:07.610 --> 17:13.770]  That guy there sees through your disguise. You see the guy getting dragged you think? No. Okay
[17:19.570 --> 17:20.010]  Flickered
[17:23.210 --> 17:29.050]  Where can I put this guy? Oh, no. Oh, it's gonna be a window you can dump him through
[17:29.770 --> 17:31.130]  Yeah, but then they'll see him out
[17:32.750 --> 17:35.830]  We're gonna we're gonna pick this lock, okay
[17:37.110 --> 17:38.930]  This is crazy
[17:41.990 --> 17:43.110]  Fuck up
[17:45.190 --> 17:52.830]  You want to wake it up with a little bruised ribs and two black eyes just someone dragged you upstairs there's more people up here Oh
[17:56.550 --> 17:58.390]  No, I think they'll see
[18:05.670 --> 18:10.050]  Oh, is that what you were asking before? Will they see? Yeah. Oh, I thought you said did he see?
[18:12.970 --> 18:14.030]  That was lucky
[18:19.870 --> 18:24.430]  So if they have that white dot over their head they'll see through your disguise. Got it. Got it. I don't know this guy
[18:25.130 --> 18:29.070]  It's a car battery. Yeah, that guy that guy knows everyone on this floor
[18:32.270 --> 18:33.190]  Friends with everyone
[18:39.010 --> 18:44.030]  If this was at Rooster Teeth, I would definitely not be a white dot. No, no
[18:46.290 --> 18:53.590]  Especially like probably like the last year a lot less people. I
[18:53.590 --> 18:58.430]  Definitely would have been a white dot in like 2012. Yeah. No, absolutely. Absolutely
[19:05.850 --> 19:11.490]  Yes, let's just keep going up I'm just gonna leave that body or is what are you trying to get to
[19:12.530 --> 19:17.170]  I'm just trying to find this man. Oh, he did say it looked like he was down in the street
[19:18.670 --> 19:23.810]  I've been all over the street. Do you have a bit all over the street? I don't think you've been all over the streets, man
[19:25.390 --> 19:27.570]  Streets is saying you ain't been there
[19:30.070 --> 19:35.470]  Was it zero one one eight is it the same no shot no fucking shot
[19:36.330 --> 19:36.750]  A
[19:41.110 --> 19:45.110]  Coin never mind. Don't need it. Oh, you can twist that little valve
[19:51.480 --> 19:56.500]  Experiments there's like five people in this room six, baby. Oh
[19:56.500 --> 19:57.160]  Stethoscope
[19:59.300 --> 20:00.520]  Always wanted to be a doctor
[20:04.340 --> 20:07.900]  Oh, no, you can poison the air conditioner this guy's researcher no
[20:08.840 --> 20:10.260]  No, I'm fine. Okay
[20:15.350 --> 20:17.610]  Like some severance shit going on in there
[20:20.470 --> 20:23.810]  Hey, I haven't seen the show but I also assume that's what it's like
[20:25.090 --> 20:30.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like where'd you grow up? Oh, he doesn't know this is like any versus Audi I get it
[20:30.830 --> 20:33.430]  Oh, wait, was that the fuck was that an air conditioner there?
[20:34.250 --> 20:39.870]  Did you put poison in that? Can you rap poison it? Yeah, you can I mean I can why wouldn't you oh
[20:40.750 --> 20:44.150]  It's gonna make everyone throw up that's pretty cool
[20:46.230 --> 20:47.730]  Is it for down there I'm guessing
[20:56.800 --> 20:58.440]  Might need to turn it on
[21:01.320 --> 21:03.180]  My not on might not be on
[21:03.740 --> 21:06.220]  You just filled it with rat poison and left
[21:06.220 --> 21:12.420]  Well, you can probably use eagle vision to see where the wire goes to the panel or something. Oh
[21:12.420 --> 21:12.780]  There you go
[21:15.040 --> 21:16.880]  Have to go in there to turn it on
[21:18.160 --> 21:18.560]  Jesus
[21:21.020 --> 21:23.080]  Rat poison so complicated
[21:23.780 --> 21:24.860]  Way too complicated
[21:26.900 --> 21:30.880]  I mean I can hear the thing going but I don't think it matters because I can't get in there any
[21:31.900 --> 21:37.180]  They're both you need the password doors and you know, it's throw a coin. Oh, yeah. Oh
[21:38.540 --> 21:42.140]  Oh, yes, oh you five five two very cool
[21:46.240 --> 21:46.760]  I
[21:46.760 --> 21:52.460]  Mean, I guess they assume that people on the outside. Yeah, I don't know the code so that I mean, that's fine. That makes sense Oh
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.040]  Schematics Oh
[21:58.040 --> 21:59.080]  Intel item nice
[22:00.740 --> 22:03.520]  Where is the event thing this way, right?
[22:06.740 --> 22:11.040]  Letter opener this is beeping. Oh shit for 815 1620
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.160]  Desmond
[22:17.780 --> 22:18.520]  Oh shit
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.380]  This right turn it on. Nope. I need a fuse
[22:25.040 --> 22:33.810]  Another calibration unit. I
[22:33.810 --> 22:35.650]  Mean that's definitely gonna do this room
[22:37.050 --> 22:46.120]  Yeah, I don't know what I'm missing it's gonna make that one scientist and the ninja guard get really sick
[22:48.660 --> 22:52.640]  It appears like he's not in here either. I think I do need to go back to the street now
[22:52.640 --> 22:56.220]  Now you're talking about the target you thought the target was in here I
[22:57.400 --> 23:01.640]  You know, we're narrowing it down. We're figuring out where he isn't. He's definitely
[23:04.200 --> 23:10.560]  Dangerous game, it's so funny. He's definitely just turning corners and going
[23:15.750 --> 23:17.590]  Maybe can I see him from up here?
[23:19.310 --> 23:22.230]  Typically you get a red outline of where the guy is. Oh really?
[23:25.150 --> 23:28.530]  Really not an elusive? I don't think so. Yeah, he's elusive
[23:31.710 --> 23:34.470]  We got to do it more often, baby. This just seems like a problem
[23:41.890 --> 23:44.890]  You came up a shitload of ladders and stairs to get here
[23:50.780 --> 23:53.240]  Nope, not going that way. Here's a break
[23:57.900 --> 23:59.340]  Everyone down the stairs
[24:01.600 --> 24:06.080]  Take me down. Good head sheen after you've come in some of the rain
[24:09.940 --> 24:14.440]  Maybe we should do a top five head sheens in video games. Those are pretty good
[24:16.440 --> 24:22.040]  What if it's like a draft where we all get one pick and then they're ha- like what if it's six?
[24:22.200 --> 24:26.420]  What if it's we all get one pick and then there's one we have to agree on for like
[24:26.440 --> 24:28.540]  like an additional six
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.840]  Interesting. Yeah, that way we all can like we can all kind of see where everyone's coming from and then see if there's something like
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.680]  Oh, yeah. Now we all agree on this other guy. Like oh, yeah, Statham belongs on the list
[24:48.280 --> 24:49.540]  Why are they searching?
[24:51.420 --> 24:56.620]  After he shot the two guys, I'm not sure. Ah, wait, is that the guy? Oh good kind of look
[24:57.860 --> 25:03.080]  Go up to him. A body's been found. Ooh, yikes
[25:13.620 --> 25:17.460]  Usually if you get close enough Diana will start saying that that's him. Oh, really?
[25:27.860 --> 25:30.140]  What? What?
[25:31.260 --> 25:32.760]  Over there. Andrew, are you in the game?
[25:35.480 --> 25:37.760]  Huh? I don't think he's gonna be in the laundry cleaners
[25:43.460 --> 25:46.080]  What is going on in the new place? Great question.
[25:48.420 --> 25:50.440]  Where the fuck is this guy?
[25:55.820 --> 25:58.920]  Oh man. Can you tell me anything?
[26:00.500 --> 26:01.560]  You gonna shove him?
[26:03.700 --> 26:11.910]  I don't think they have intel. Hmm.
[26:13.330 --> 26:15.430]  These two random people smoking in the rain
[26:17.830 --> 26:22.390]  They're so far from everything. They went so far out there to smoke. That was crazy
[26:26.280 --> 26:27.000]  Noodle restaurant?
[26:31.260 --> 26:32.000]  You look interesting
[26:34.460 --> 26:38.660]  You should walk up to him and say that. He looks like a man of interest. Hey, what's up? You look interesting
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.200]  Oh. Are you kind of like taking this all in Gavin? You like learning like the do's and don'ts?
[26:50.200 --> 26:52.940]  Yeah, I should be. I'm coming up with some ideas. Okay, that's cool
[27:01.020 --> 27:03.220]  Ooh. He's outside? Yeah.
[27:04.220 --> 27:05.340]  I'm trespassing?
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.740]  Is this where you started?
[27:09.880 --> 27:12.220]  Ah shit! You can go in there
[27:13.200 --> 27:15.900]  Hey, I went one way. Zero, one, one, eight.
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.400]  Zero. One, one.
[27:22.600 --> 27:26.280]  Yeah! Not even gonna bother to look. I love it
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.880]  Fuck. I don't want to just go back through the noodle place, but I can't. Shit.
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.660]  Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Coin.
[27:42.520 --> 27:44.340]  That's a letter opener. Coin.
[27:45.340 --> 27:46.120]  It's like a big coin
[27:48.240 --> 27:51.260]  What's the point of the coin? Oh, it makes them go, hey, what's this?
[27:56.180 --> 27:59.800]  And then like they search further? Like this is just to sort of like break them out or something?
[28:02.340 --> 28:03.240]  Oh, come on!
[28:05.080 --> 28:06.180]  Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot!
[28:09.000 --> 28:09.640]  Oh, Jesus.
[28:14.180 --> 28:17.940]  I probably don't need to move him. I will take my letter opener back.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.680]  Oh, that's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're gonna want that.
[28:20.120 --> 28:21.520]  You don't think someone's gonna walk by there?
[28:22.020 --> 28:24.740]  Nah, I wouldn't worry. Nah, I'm with Andrew, I wouldn't worry about it.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.920]  I closed the door. Oh, the gate is closed. Let's go in there.
[28:26.960 --> 28:28.180]  Those guys are sleeping.
[28:33.440 --> 28:34.300]  There he is.
[28:36.480 --> 28:38.580]  He's coming out that door. So you just had to go straight.
[28:41.160 --> 28:42.080]  Why are you looking backwards?
[28:43.040 --> 28:44.020]  Where is he? There!
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.920]  Oh, there he was! That was him!
[28:48.280 --> 28:49.020]  He's walking around.
[28:50.940 --> 28:52.220]  Oh, so he's by the old...
[28:53.820 --> 28:54.220]  Arcade.
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.540]  Can I...
[28:57.540 --> 28:59.340]  Can I...
[29:01.800 --> 29:02.160]  Oh.
[29:08.910 --> 29:10.030]  Can I go in here?
[29:10.830 --> 29:12.430]  There's a door off to the side.
[29:14.690 --> 29:15.810]  I'm going the way that they went.
[29:16.010 --> 29:17.310]  Whoops! Oh no!
[29:18.030 --> 29:19.970]  Excuse me. Should I go in this door?
[29:20.190 --> 29:20.950]  I'm in the trash can.
[29:21.650 --> 29:22.570]  I'm a stinky trash man.
[29:26.440 --> 29:27.880]  Oh, there's a rat. Did you see that rat?
[29:28.460 --> 29:30.080]  Oh yeah, you got to sweep the poisons for it.
[29:33.120 --> 29:35.540]  I saw my reflection and I thought it was a guy.
[29:36.260 --> 29:37.600]  I've done that once.
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.180]  What else have we got? A screwdriver.
[29:43.520 --> 29:45.480]  I walked straight into a guy because I thought it was me.
[29:52.990 --> 29:54.010]  Is he in?
[29:57.430 --> 29:58.150]  Freedom Fighters!
[29:59.050 --> 29:59.790]  Hey, honey bear.
[30:00.070 --> 30:02.190]  Is he in the room next door?
[30:02.190 --> 30:04.310]  I think he went up maybe?
[30:11.810 --> 30:13.370]  Oh no.
[30:14.550 --> 30:16.010]  I wanted a guard.
[30:22.440 --> 30:24.010]  Sorry about that.
[30:25.550 --> 30:30.650]  I'm going to put you in here.
[30:34.200 --> 30:35.300]  Try it again.
[30:36.340 --> 30:37.420]  Get my coin back.
[30:45.880 --> 30:47.520]  Oh no, that's her husband.
[30:47.780 --> 30:48.620]  That's a shit.
[30:48.800 --> 30:50.960]  He's going to walk in and see his wife knocked out.
[30:52.360 --> 30:52.920]  Married?
[30:57.480 --> 30:58.620]  That's my coin.
[30:59.460 --> 31:00.020]  Fuck.
[31:02.740 --> 31:05.920]  Oh, they found the bodies outside.
[31:06.420 --> 31:06.720]  Shit.
[31:07.320 --> 31:08.740]  Honestly, who could have seen that coming?
[31:09.620 --> 31:10.460]  Oh, fuck.
[31:10.920 --> 31:13.160]  I didn't think about somebody leaving work.
[31:15.020 --> 31:15.720]  Uh.
[31:18.040 --> 31:20.480]  Wait, that's the whole arcade?
[31:21.320 --> 31:21.500]  Yeah.
[31:22.380 --> 31:23.200]  Oh.
[31:32.620 --> 31:35.420]  Holy tank.
[31:41.760 --> 31:47.080]  Anyone outside?
[31:48.840 --> 31:49.760]  Oh, that guy.
[31:56.440 --> 31:57.240]  Oh, shit.
[31:59.360 --> 32:00.520]  Security is getting involved.
[32:01.640 --> 32:01.820]  Yeah.
[32:05.600 --> 32:06.500]  Is this the gym?
[32:07.800 --> 32:10.420]  Yeah, that square right there, that's the gym.
[32:12.340 --> 32:14.180]  Does he come down here and spa with that guy?
[32:16.760 --> 32:17.560]  You're crazy.
[32:19.480 --> 32:21.420]  I thought he was going to try to lure him.
[32:23.060 --> 32:23.820]  There we go.
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.720]  Wow, knock him out.
[32:26.780 --> 32:27.780]  Wait, who's that?
[32:32.670 --> 32:34.610]  This is Andrew, this is nuts.
[32:35.190 --> 32:36.230]  Who found him?
[32:38.210 --> 32:39.250]  The bloody...
[32:39.250 --> 32:40.630]  Oh, from up there.
[32:40.990 --> 32:42.130]  That's insane.
[32:42.810 --> 32:44.510]  Well, he did it right in the open courtyard.
[32:45.210 --> 32:46.770]  He's not even a disguisable.
[32:47.190 --> 32:47.710]  Incredible.
[32:48.590 --> 32:49.050]  Incredible.
[32:51.650 --> 32:53.290]  You better get out of here.
[32:56.190 --> 32:57.350]  Turn on water pump.
[32:57.790 --> 32:58.970]  Oh, you can electrocute him.
[32:59.670 --> 33:01.370]  Do you have a car battery you can throw into it?
[33:01.730 --> 33:05.170]  No, there's a car battery way upstairs in the place that he was in that he wasn't supposed to be in.
[33:08.270 --> 33:09.150]  How are you not...
[33:09.150 --> 33:09.810]  Oh, my God.
[33:09.930 --> 33:12.470]  This is bad.
[33:13.890 --> 33:15.430]  Oh, there's a ladder up there.
[33:20.570 --> 33:22.650]  You can shoot that propane tank next to him.
[33:22.650 --> 33:23.830]  Oh, never mind.
[33:26.210 --> 33:27.770]  Oh, they're leaving.
[33:28.170 --> 33:29.190]  They're all leaving.
[33:30.750 --> 33:33.110]  So they've probably locked down the target.
[33:33.190 --> 33:34.170]  They're probably taking him somewhere.
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.940]  How are they seeing...
[33:44.140 --> 33:45.460]  Who's seeing me?
[33:48.100 --> 33:50.160]  Oh, they're all over there.
[33:50.320 --> 33:51.860]  They are all over there.
[33:53.040 --> 33:53.320]  Wait.
[33:53.320 --> 33:54.760]  I got him.
[33:54.760 --> 33:55.240]  I got him.
[33:56.420 --> 33:58.880]  Out of control.
[33:59.320 --> 34:00.280]  Where are you?
[34:00.520 --> 34:01.340]  Now what?
[34:04.080 --> 34:04.900]  Excuse me.
[34:04.920 --> 34:05.300]  Excuse me.
[34:05.360 --> 34:07.840]  I can't believe you did that.
[34:10.100 --> 34:10.380]  Okay.
[34:12.080 --> 34:13.180]  That was wild.
[34:13.360 --> 34:14.260]  I have to get out of here.
[34:14.420 --> 34:16.440]  How did that work?
[34:23.920 --> 34:24.740]  Ain't nobody.
[34:25.040 --> 34:26.240]  That was Andrew.
[34:26.240 --> 34:27.140]  No way.
[34:27.460 --> 34:28.080]  Andrew.
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.200]  And you were only tier two this whole time.
[34:40.100 --> 34:42.100]  Is this how I get up there?
[34:42.320 --> 34:44.240]  Or is this the...
[34:44.900 --> 34:45.260]  Nope.
[34:45.720 --> 34:46.540]  That's the exit.
[34:49.020 --> 34:50.620]  Just for a laugh.
[34:53.520 --> 34:54.900]  They're in the dark.
[34:56.340 --> 34:58.060]  You got a crowbar in your head.
[34:59.120 --> 34:59.300]  Yeah.
[35:00.450 --> 35:00.780]  Okay.
[35:01.580 --> 35:04.360]  You report people to me.
[35:04.560 --> 35:05.360]  It doesn't matter.
[35:05.940 --> 35:06.720]  I'm on my way out.
[35:14.800 --> 35:15.460]  Reload!
[35:16.160 --> 35:16.960]  Oh, shit.
[35:22.880 --> 35:23.920]  This is...
[35:23.920 --> 35:25.640]  Watching you play this is outrageous.
[35:34.020 --> 35:35.120]  Hitman's a good game.
[35:35.520 --> 35:36.500]  And we did it!
[35:37.020 --> 35:38.500]  That's the elusive target.
[35:38.720 --> 35:39.900]  Andrew, that was incredible.
[35:40.480 --> 35:41.940]  That was so crazy.
[35:42.800 --> 35:45.360]  And now you get to watch Gavin do it properly.
[35:46.040 --> 35:47.800]  I don't know if I can do it better than that.
[35:48.360 --> 35:49.680]  You killed him.
[35:49.680 --> 35:50.400]  Well, I got him.
[35:52.460 --> 35:53.840]  Yeah, pretty low score.
[35:57.080 --> 35:58.720]  I'm the melon man.
[35:58.900 --> 36:00.000]  Did you get no stars?
[36:01.560 --> 36:02.900]  Uh, yeah, I believe so.
[36:03.160 --> 36:04.040]  New personal best.
[36:07.570 --> 36:08.090]  Okay.
[36:08.330 --> 36:08.850]  Halfway.
[36:09.290 --> 36:10.950]  Cool, absolution suit.
[36:12.310 --> 36:13.650]  Okay, well, that's my attempt.
[36:13.830 --> 36:16.490]  Now we will watch Gavin take on the same guy.
[36:16.710 --> 36:18.150]  And see how he does it.
[36:18.150 --> 36:19.310]  I can't wait.
[36:19.890 --> 36:20.770]  Let's do this, Gavin.
[36:22.210 --> 36:23.630]  So what are you doing different?
[36:23.910 --> 36:26.810]  Like, let me know what you're doing different here from what Andrew did.
[36:27.430 --> 36:29.290]  Uh, I'm gonna bring in some pills.
[36:29.730 --> 36:29.910]  Okay.
[36:29.950 --> 36:30.570]  I like pills.
[36:32.010 --> 36:33.590]  Hey, brother, I hear that.
[36:33.910 --> 36:34.270]  Absolutely.
[36:35.430 --> 36:37.290]  I'm gonna bring in a briefcase.
[36:37.590 --> 36:37.990]  Okay.
[36:38.550 --> 36:40.490]  I might just put my lockpick in that, to be honest.
[36:42.550 --> 36:44.150]  Seems like a...
[36:44.150 --> 36:45.530]  Unnecessary briefcase.
[36:45.530 --> 36:46.970]  Although it's fun to throw.
[36:47.610 --> 36:48.870]  It's nice to have the briefcase.
[36:48.990 --> 36:49.950]  Oh, is it like a good weapon?
[36:50.910 --> 36:51.750]  It's a great weapon.
[36:54.050 --> 36:55.830]  I'll just bring the lockpick without the briefcase.
[36:56.210 --> 36:56.470]  Sweet.
[36:57.950 --> 36:59.230]  What should I wear, though?
[36:59.950 --> 37:00.950]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[37:01.150 --> 37:02.310]  Yeah, you gotta really think about it.
[37:03.570 --> 37:05.170]  Oh, I should've looked into that.
[37:06.870 --> 37:07.890]  I'm gonna wear this green shirt.
[37:08.250 --> 37:09.350]  I like it. It's good.
[37:10.070 --> 37:11.330]  The green streak.
[37:13.450 --> 37:14.030]  The green streak.
[37:15.410 --> 37:16.890]  Is that a phrase?
[37:17.070 --> 37:18.670]  Is the green streak a phrase?
[37:19.770 --> 37:22.030]  It feels like a comic from the 50s.
[37:22.110 --> 37:23.470]  Or maybe like a radio play.
[37:24.550 --> 37:25.150]  I read...
[37:25.150 --> 37:26.230]  I read...
[37:27.110 --> 37:29.610]  Doonesbury and the green streak.
[37:31.790 --> 37:33.810]  Mary Worth was terrible today,
[37:33.910 --> 37:36.550]  but the green streak really had him on the up and out.
[37:37.170 --> 37:40.110]  A superhero about getting the economy on track.
[37:40.110 --> 37:41.310]  The green streak.
[37:41.330 --> 37:43.750]  Hey, we can use the green streak now more than ever.
[37:46.510 --> 37:47.490]  It's to be raining.
[37:48.110 --> 37:50.390]  It does, and you've stopped blending in.
[37:50.830 --> 37:52.170]  Now people know the green streak is here.
[37:52.390 --> 37:52.970]  I have stopped.
[37:54.110 --> 37:55.870]  Oh my god, what are you doing?
[37:56.510 --> 37:57.550]  That was instant.
[37:58.730 --> 37:59.950]  No silent assassin for me.
[38:00.070 --> 38:00.690]  Alright, let's do this.
[38:02.310 --> 38:03.990]  Just gotta get out of the system a little bit.
[38:04.130 --> 38:04.610]  Oh, wow.
[38:05.430 --> 38:06.770]  I didn't know it was in your system.
[38:09.110 --> 38:11.610]  Let's see what else is in my system today.
[38:20.450 --> 38:21.410]  Oh, 0118.
[38:22.330 --> 38:22.810]  0118?
[38:23.910 --> 38:26.150]  Yes, yes.
[38:28.250 --> 38:28.730]  011...
[38:30.750 --> 38:33.490]  You can just go straight to the arcade if you want.
[38:33.710 --> 38:34.170]  Set up.
[38:35.410 --> 38:36.390]  Is that the arcade?
[38:36.390 --> 38:37.210]  To the left?
[38:38.010 --> 38:38.950]  Over here is the arcade, isn't it?
[38:39.490 --> 38:41.510]  You just played this!
[38:42.570 --> 38:43.750]  You look like the arcade to me.
[38:45.850 --> 38:47.010]  You're crazy, dude.
[38:48.170 --> 38:49.070]  Oh, that's the arcade.
[38:51.210 --> 38:57.170]  Alright, chill out.
[38:57.270 --> 38:58.550]  See you later.
[39:01.330 --> 39:02.270]  Where's your briefcase?
[39:02.730 --> 39:03.370]  I didn't bring it in.
[39:03.530 --> 39:04.890]  He decided not to bring it.
[39:11.170 --> 39:13.030]  Where's the line of sight to that little courtyard?
[39:18.370 --> 39:20.570]  Just look for where all the guards were
[39:20.570 --> 39:21.990]  that saw Andrew when he was
[39:22.830 --> 39:24.470]  decimating everyone down there.
[39:26.250 --> 39:27.330]  It's gotta be up there, right?
[39:28.930 --> 39:29.850]  That's a good way to go.
[39:32.870 --> 39:34.450]  I can't believe you beat this, Andrew.
[39:35.150 --> 39:36.230]  I can't believe you did.
[39:36.230 --> 39:38.410]  I've never failed at any of them that we've done,
[39:38.410 --> 39:40.430]  but they've all looked like that.
[39:41.830 --> 39:43.130]  It's so crazy.
[39:43.350 --> 39:44.470]  This is where I was, wasn't it?
[39:44.570 --> 39:45.490]  Isn't this where I came in?
[39:46.650 --> 39:46.850]  Yeah.
[39:48.230 --> 39:49.890]  Pretty busy area.
[39:59.430 --> 40:00.210]  What's your thought?
[40:01.190 --> 40:03.730]  Well, I might try and get that guy.
[40:04.850 --> 40:05.050]  Yeah.
[40:05.990 --> 40:06.590]  I did that.
[40:08.670 --> 40:09.430]  Give me this.
[40:14.370 --> 40:15.950]  Staying there an awful long time.
[40:16.850 --> 40:18.730]  He's just chillin'.
[40:18.730 --> 40:20.490]  Trying to figure out where the arcade is.
[40:20.790 --> 40:21.990]  He's hearing about it.
[40:23.890 --> 40:25.350]  I forgot he comes right past, doesn't he?
[40:26.230 --> 40:26.550]  Yep.
[40:27.630 --> 40:28.930]  That's what went wrong for me.
[40:30.890 --> 40:32.930]  Or one of the many things that went wrong.
[40:35.450 --> 40:36.570]  Where'd he goddamn go?
[40:36.670 --> 40:38.950]  I think I pulled him.
[40:38.950 --> 40:40.070]  You need to pull him.
[40:40.170 --> 40:42.110]  He's gonna stop there.
[41:02.030 --> 41:03.310]  Get him.
[41:03.990 --> 41:04.810]  Get him.
[41:05.950 --> 41:06.590]  Yeah!
[41:09.490 --> 41:11.230]  And he's kind of hidden.
[41:12.810 --> 41:13.450]  Yeah.
[41:13.970 --> 41:15.110]  Nobody'll go through there.
[41:20.190 --> 41:21.350]  You're in him.
[41:21.870 --> 41:23.510]  Just naked against the wall.
[41:23.510 --> 41:24.290]  You're becoming one.
[41:27.110 --> 41:27.990]  Oh, goddammit.
[41:29.070 --> 41:30.670]  I need to look out this window, I think.
[41:33.730 --> 41:34.990]  Oh, I see.
[41:36.610 --> 41:38.190]  Alright, I'll just do the double tap like you did.
[41:38.550 --> 41:39.570]  Are there people below you?
[41:41.110 --> 41:41.490]  Yeah.
[41:42.010 --> 41:42.290]  Okay.
[41:45.710 --> 41:47.270]  Maybe one bullet, two heads?
[41:48.890 --> 41:49.130]  Nope.
[41:50.170 --> 41:52.610]  I don't think it over-penetrates like that.
[41:53.570 --> 41:54.310]  No, it doesn't.
[41:54.310 --> 41:55.910]  That'd be cool if it did.
[41:56.930 --> 41:58.470]  Maybe with a sniper it does?
[41:59.150 --> 41:59.690]  I'm sorry, Gavin.
[42:00.030 --> 42:00.830]  Yeah, Gavin, what was that?
[42:02.390 --> 42:04.310]  Alright, well, there's no...
[42:05.110 --> 42:05.430]  Okay.
[42:10.770 --> 42:11.570]  Oh, man.
[42:11.830 --> 42:13.390]  They paid the price, it was unfortunate.
[42:14.130 --> 42:15.030]  I had to find out.
[42:17.030 --> 42:18.130]  Oh, wrong courtyard.
[42:21.270 --> 42:22.390]  Alright, well, let's get in here.
[42:22.390 --> 42:23.130]  Okay.
[42:25.570 --> 42:26.790]  Can I jump over?
[42:27.930 --> 42:28.370]  Nice!
[42:28.870 --> 42:29.250]  Good move.
[42:30.650 --> 42:31.950]  Isn't there a key around here somewhere?
[42:33.410 --> 42:34.330]  What? Is there?
[42:34.950 --> 42:36.430]  Thought it was under a pot or something.
[42:39.430 --> 42:41.850]  Hey, you got a lockpick.
[42:43.070 --> 42:44.970]  I'll put husband and wife in that cabinet again.
[42:47.410 --> 42:48.630]  Oh, there's the mirror guy.
[42:49.870 --> 42:50.310]  Oh!
[42:50.870 --> 42:52.550]  Oh, he's in there, isn't he?
[42:54.370 --> 42:56.490]  What do these people have a problem with?
[42:58.010 --> 42:58.450]  You?
[42:59.770 --> 43:00.210]  Yeah.
[43:02.590 --> 43:03.830]  Oh, 118, I believe.
[43:04.590 --> 43:06.170]  Is that the same one?
[43:06.170 --> 43:08.970]  We do not know the door code for this. No fucking way.
[43:12.210 --> 43:15.070]  Was it 2552 was the one that was way up there?
[43:15.950 --> 43:16.710]  I don't remember.
[43:16.710 --> 43:18.890]  I remember it started and ended with a Q.
[43:22.050 --> 43:23.970]  You're a psycho. You're nuts.
[43:24.110 --> 43:25.950]  You're gonna murder the wife?
[43:27.210 --> 43:28.710]  Probably first, and then...
[43:29.970 --> 43:32.850]  There's a guard on the other side of the door, though.
[43:33.350 --> 43:33.770]  Yeah.
[43:34.670 --> 43:35.990]  You got a silencer on.
[43:36.790 --> 43:37.590]  That would help.
[43:38.150 --> 43:40.430]  Yeah, but it's gonna hit the window behind them, probably.
[43:41.970 --> 43:43.290]  Oh, now bullets penetrate?
[43:43.290 --> 43:45.150]  Yeah, now they're penetrative.
[43:45.550 --> 43:46.530]  No, I mean if I miss.
[43:47.730 --> 43:48.950]  Oh, you're not gonna miss.
[43:49.110 --> 43:49.330]  Okay.
[43:50.990 --> 43:52.250]  Oh god, you almost missed.
[43:52.530 --> 43:55.290]  Okay, yeah, that was...
[44:02.420 --> 44:03.720]  Door just closes on you.
[44:04.060 --> 44:04.800]  Oh, there you go.
[44:07.200 --> 44:09.160]  Where's that man? Oh, he's right there.
[44:09.400 --> 44:09.980]  Oh, he's right there.
[44:10.880 --> 44:12.500]  Alright, I'll wait for her to turn around.
[44:12.720 --> 44:14.380]  I'll do him, and then I'll do her.
[44:14.380 --> 44:14.520]  Yeah.
[44:18.180 --> 44:19.220]  Make sure to reload.
[44:20.440 --> 44:21.400]  What's the reload button?
[44:22.600 --> 44:23.560]  Right bumper, I believe?
[44:23.840 --> 44:24.580]  No, triangle to reload.
[44:27.460 --> 44:28.380]  Hold Y to reload.
[44:30.660 --> 44:31.140]  Okay.
[44:31.400 --> 44:32.660]  Oh no.
[44:33.500 --> 44:34.300]  Get away from the wall.
[44:34.600 --> 44:38.040]  Yeah, good job.
[44:38.300 --> 44:39.740]  She's fine, she's just checking out that shelf.
[44:40.200 --> 44:40.400]  Yeah.
[44:41.900 --> 44:42.880]  There's sleep bullets.
[44:44.000 --> 44:44.860]  They're just sleeping.
[44:45.240 --> 44:46.180]  Oh, they're sleeping alright.
[44:47.200 --> 44:47.920]  Is that him?
[44:48.820 --> 44:50.940]  No. Does he have like a hat on or something?
[44:52.260 --> 44:53.200]  That man has hair.
[44:55.040 --> 44:56.100]  Alright, I'll just wait here.
[44:59.280 --> 45:00.320]  You're just gonna wait?
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.060]  Yeah, and then...
[45:02.060 --> 45:03.360]  You think he comes down?
[45:03.780 --> 45:04.860]  Yeah, I think he goes in there.
[45:06.300 --> 45:07.240]  You think he fights in there?
[45:11.200 --> 45:11.620]  Well...
[45:11.620 --> 45:13.500]  I'd suggest taking over the guy
[45:13.500 --> 45:14.960]  and fighting him, but you can't...
[45:14.960 --> 45:16.240]  I'd kill him, there's no outfit.
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.140]  There's no role to do that.
[45:19.360 --> 45:20.100]  Oh, are they coming in now?
[45:22.000 --> 45:22.440]  What?
[45:25.040 --> 45:26.480]  I'm worried that he's at this door.
[45:28.780 --> 45:29.680]  Right bumper it.
[45:30.620 --> 45:30.940]  Alright.
[45:33.560 --> 45:35.160]  I'd never use that for some reason.
[45:36.360 --> 45:36.800]  Why?
[45:37.900 --> 45:38.900]  It's so helpful.
[45:38.900 --> 45:39.940]  It just feels like cheating.
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.340]  It's part of the game.
[45:42.640 --> 45:44.520]  Yeah, but I'm a purist.
[45:49.160 --> 45:49.980]  That's unfortunate.
[45:51.800 --> 45:53.680]  Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun!
[45:53.780 --> 45:55.820]  Gun! Fire!
[45:57.960 --> 46:00.000]  You need to... you can't go this way.
[46:00.760 --> 46:01.620]  It's locked.
[46:02.760 --> 46:04.700]  This has got even worse than it...
[46:04.700 --> 46:06.840]  How are you doing worse than Ian?
[46:06.860 --> 46:07.080]  Gavin!
[46:07.760 --> 46:10.500]  So my plan was, I was gonna shoot this down, right?
[46:10.500 --> 46:11.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:11.680 --> 46:13.620]  Oh, that's cool.
[46:14.080 --> 46:15.460]  It is, uh...
[46:16.220 --> 46:18.700]  What are you firing?
[46:20.160 --> 46:21.660]  You can't go that way!
[46:22.300 --> 46:24.880]  No, I know, but if I make noise, maybe it'll open the fricking door.
[46:26.640 --> 46:27.680]  No way!
[46:28.220 --> 46:29.140]  That worked!
[46:31.280 --> 46:31.800]  Insane!
[46:34.460 --> 46:34.980]  Unbelievable.
[46:36.540 --> 46:38.600]  I mean, really, I need to not be going upstairs.
[46:38.600 --> 46:39.420]  Yeah.
[46:40.680 --> 46:42.800]  I mean, yeah, but is it longer?
[46:45.420 --> 46:46.200]  What's that?
[46:46.340 --> 46:47.100]  Some sort of bust?
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.940]  Someone's gonna get busted.
[46:55.730 --> 46:57.090]  Oh, that feels dangerous.
[46:59.530 --> 46:59.830]  Oh!
[47:00.310 --> 47:00.850]  Who was that?
[47:07.370 --> 47:08.330]  Who's shooting at me?
[47:09.350 --> 47:10.490]  You're getting shot at?
[47:10.910 --> 47:11.650]  Oh, shit.
[47:14.190 --> 47:14.630]  Nice.
[47:15.210 --> 47:16.570]  Why am I looking down the wrong shoulder?
[47:18.690 --> 47:20.090]  Oh, you can swap shoulders.
[47:26.150 --> 47:28.350]  I mean, you're so close to that one right in front of you.
[47:33.720 --> 47:35.920]  How did you get into this mess, man?
[47:36.100 --> 47:37.140]  This is really something.
[47:37.780 --> 47:37.980]  Get him!
[47:42.940 --> 47:43.200]  Oh!
[47:46.300 --> 47:46.740]  Gavin!
[47:46.740 --> 47:46.840]  Gavin!
[47:47.740 --> 47:48.620]  He failed!
[47:49.580 --> 47:51.120]  We have our first fail!
[47:51.440 --> 47:52.660]  That is crazy.
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.560]  That's never happened!
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.020]  Did you see the greed? Instead of shooting that guy, I went to shoot the fire extinguisher.
[47:59.400 --> 47:59.860]  I saw it.
[48:01.380 --> 48:02.460]  I saw it.
[48:02.680 --> 48:03.320]  Oh, Gavin!
[48:03.540 --> 48:06.060]  In theory, that was gonna be an average run.
[48:06.200 --> 48:08.960]  Turned out into, you know, a complete turbo shit show.
[48:09.240 --> 48:10.040]  Yeah, that was...
[48:10.040 --> 48:10.420]  Wow.
[48:10.620 --> 48:11.320]  That was brutal.
[48:11.320 --> 48:13.680]  Do you get anything for that?
[48:13.760 --> 48:14.800]  I got the elusive suit.
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.280]  Do you just not get that? I'm assuming that's the prize.
[48:17.480 --> 48:18.560]  What's the elusive suit?
[48:20.060 --> 48:21.440]  It's what I got for beating it.
[48:21.520 --> 48:22.880]  It was called the elusive suit?
[48:23.420 --> 48:23.820]  Yeah.
[48:24.220 --> 48:26.380]  I don't think that's what it was called, but that's fine.
[48:27.340 --> 48:28.360]  That's not what it was called.
[48:29.600 --> 48:30.440]  Let me look.
[48:30.980 --> 48:31.920]  Where's my outfit?
[48:32.260 --> 48:35.440]  I'm pretty sure that's not what it was called, but I think it's pretty exciting.
[48:36.360 --> 48:37.140]  Career inventory.
[48:37.140 --> 48:38.640]  Uh-huh.
[48:40.100 --> 48:40.540]  Suits.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.820]  Oh, it's absolution suits.
[48:43.420 --> 48:44.080]  That's funny.
[48:46.280 --> 48:47.680]  The elusive suit.
[48:48.880 --> 48:52.120]  I mean, I could use an elusive suit with how I played.
[48:52.420 --> 48:53.240]  Oh my god.
[48:53.380 --> 48:55.100]  I wake up wearing the elusive suit every day.
[48:55.740 --> 48:57.640]  I, uh, I learned a lot
[48:58.280 --> 49:00.020]  about how you guys do this
[49:00.020 --> 49:01.320]  and what this game is and everything,
[49:01.320 --> 49:02.800]  so I found that to be really interesting.
[49:03.660 --> 49:05.100]  That was not a good reflection
[49:05.100 --> 49:06.660]  of typically how Gavin does things.
[49:06.680 --> 49:09.020]  He's typically a lot more sneaky and it goes his way.
[49:09.120 --> 49:09.620]  I'm shocked.
[49:09.860 --> 49:12.760]  I should have waited for them to resolve
[49:12.760 --> 49:14.960]  whatever they were doing out there, but I just wanted to move the bodies
[49:15.460 --> 49:17.420]  and then drop that birdcage thing on him.
[49:18.020 --> 49:18.740]  I get it.
[49:19.320 --> 49:20.340]  This was a lot of fun, though.
[49:20.480 --> 49:22.840]  I can't wait to do another
[49:22.840 --> 49:24.780]  elusive target. Maybe there will be another celebrity.
[49:24.920 --> 49:26.700]  Maybe not. Who cares? These are just fun to do.
[49:26.880 --> 49:28.860]  Thank you so much for joining us, Eric.
[49:29.260 --> 49:31.340]  Thanks for having me. I want to watch you guys do this again.
[49:31.400 --> 49:31.940]  This was a blast.
[49:31.940 --> 49:33.720]  We should absolutely do that.
