[00:00.000 --> 00:02.120]  Uh, I don't think you're supposed to leave the grounds.
[00:02.220 --> 00:02.600]  Oh, goodbye.
[00:03.780 --> 00:05.240]  I don't want to inherit.
[00:06.180 --> 00:06.660]  Ooh!
[00:08.080 --> 00:08.320]  Oh.
[00:09.860 --> 00:10.340]  Oh.
[00:13.440 --> 00:13.940]  We're back.
[00:16.380 --> 00:17.100]  Art is crazy.
[00:17.420 --> 00:17.640]  What?
[00:17.660 --> 00:19.460]  What are you talking about?
[00:19.940 --> 00:20.280]  What?
[00:20.460 --> 00:24.940]  I cannot believe that just fucking happened.
[00:25.120 --> 00:25.620]  What are you talking about?
[00:26.020 --> 00:27.680]  Are you for real?
[00:27.680 --> 00:30.020]  He's like a golden retriever.
[00:30.160 --> 00:31.420]  He just gets like...
[00:31.420 --> 00:33.700]  He just gets distracted and then it's like
[00:33.700 --> 00:36.140]  the thing he was doing never existed.
[00:36.340 --> 00:37.160]  It doesn't work.
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.320]  No, yeah, it is blocked.
[00:39.740 --> 00:40.540]  There you go.
[00:41.460 --> 00:43.780]  Well, I assumed that it would get in there for some reason.
[00:45.620 --> 00:47.240]  Based on what?
[00:50.120 --> 00:50.640]  Mechanics.
[00:51.360 --> 00:52.660]  This is where you sleep.
[00:52.840 --> 00:53.760]  What mechanic?
[00:54.340 --> 00:55.360]  Oh my god.
[00:55.820 --> 00:56.520]  Me, I'm the mechanic.
