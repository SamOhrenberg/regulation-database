[00:00.000 --> 00:04.700]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay of FBC Firebreak.
[00:04.800 --> 00:07.200]  We're doing a new job. We're doing paper chase.
[00:07.980 --> 00:09.660]  Something I don't like doing in real life.
[00:09.740 --> 00:12.060]  I'm not a big paper guy, but hopefully this is fun.
[00:12.360 --> 00:12.840]  I'm sure it will be.
[00:12.920 --> 00:15.980]  You know, I don't like driving a bulldozer in real life,
[00:16.060 --> 00:17.040]  but I can't get enough of it.
[00:17.280 --> 00:20.460]  So I have assuming that this is going to be thrilling.
[00:20.960 --> 00:22.220]  Do you not like doing that in real life?
[00:22.880 --> 00:24.800]  I was going to say, do you know that you don't like it?
[00:24.820 --> 00:25.760]  Have you ever tried that?
[00:26.160 --> 00:29.480]  No, but it looks super hard and complicated and loud
[00:29.480 --> 00:32.840]  and probably vibratey and there's no AC.
[00:33.280 --> 00:34.720]  I'm not going to be able to listen to the radio.
[00:34.880 --> 00:36.980]  You know what I mean? Yeah, that's fair.
[00:37.220 --> 00:40.460]  And in the interim between videos, I paid our rent.
[00:40.760 --> 00:43.280]  Hell yeah. We just bought one more month of this place.
[00:43.780 --> 00:47.920]  Thank you to everyone who supports us on Patreon that allows us to pay the rent.
[00:48.440 --> 00:48.880]  Absolutely.
[00:49.600 --> 00:51.800]  So I played the beta of this game,
[00:51.920 --> 00:54.280]  and this is the mission I think I did.
[00:54.640 --> 00:56.080]  And I'm excited if it is.
[00:56.260 --> 00:59.020]  Does it feel different to the... It feels so much different.
[00:59.020 --> 00:59.740]  It feels a lot better.
[00:59.800 --> 01:01.640]  Also, playing with people makes it a lot better.
[01:02.160 --> 01:03.580]  OK, we got to get rid of these sticky notes.
[01:04.640 --> 01:05.620]  Geoff's already having a shower.
[01:06.460 --> 01:07.420]  Just making sure it all works.
[01:08.340 --> 01:10.300]  Oh, man, it's dark this level. Shit.
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.620]  OK, so if you get too covered in paper, you get brazilled.
[01:16.380 --> 01:18.340]  So just be mindful of your paper count.
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.280]  I can wash you off.
[01:21.380 --> 01:22.800]  You say we're trying to get rid of the sticky notes?
[01:22.800 --> 01:24.020]  Yeah, we got to get rid of the sticky notes.
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.560]  We got to destroy them. See in the top left.
[01:26.340 --> 01:28.000]  Oh, yeah. What are we just running through?
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.520]  I'm shooting them.
[01:30.740 --> 01:32.360]  Oh, I've been just running through.
[01:32.520 --> 01:35.980]  I'm not sure how a shotgun does against the paper.
[01:38.220 --> 01:39.040]  From the walls.
[01:40.520 --> 01:42.520]  Yeah, I'm just using myself like a brush.
[01:43.340 --> 01:43.540]  Yeah.
[01:44.700 --> 01:46.640]  If you put a stick on me, I'd be a broom.
[01:48.820 --> 01:49.740]  Andrew, I've got paper.
[01:51.500 --> 01:53.020]  Andrew, I can't see. I've got paper.
[01:53.020 --> 01:54.000]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[01:54.180 --> 01:56.100]  I told you, you'd brazil yourself.
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.760]  I've been...
[01:59.760 --> 02:01.140]  Gavin, you covered in paper.
[02:01.400 --> 02:02.060]  I've become...
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.240]  I just fully died.
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.520]  He's become a paper monster. We got to stop him.
[02:10.700 --> 02:13.080]  Okay, you just straight up died, I think. Sorry, Gavin.
[02:14.280 --> 02:14.580]  Whoa.
[02:14.900 --> 02:15.240]  Wow.
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.500]  So let's be mindful of these paper counts.
[02:18.100 --> 02:18.300]  Yeah.
[02:19.140 --> 02:20.200]  Death by paper cuts.
[02:20.800 --> 02:21.000]  Yep.
[02:23.940 --> 02:25.400]  Maybe there's a...
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.060]  I think there were sprinklers when I played this before.
[02:29.580 --> 02:30.520]  Those are really helpful.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.020]  Let me know if anyone finds a bottle of goo gone.
[02:35.140 --> 02:36.340]  Whatever that shit's called.
[02:36.720 --> 02:37.600]  What is this?
[02:38.060 --> 02:40.800]  Like a speaker that's broken in this room that I'm in?
[02:43.660 --> 02:44.180]  Okay.
[02:44.480 --> 02:45.000]  Hey, Andrew.
[02:45.380 --> 02:45.700]  Yeah?
[02:45.880 --> 02:46.720]  It's not broken anymore.
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.520]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[02:49.200 --> 02:50.440]  Oh, rock on.
[02:50.560 --> 02:51.440]  Hell yeah.
[02:52.740 --> 02:54.100]  Oh shit, it's spawning people.
[02:54.100 --> 02:55.540]  I don't know if that was a good thing to spawn.
[02:57.300 --> 02:58.020]  Fire extinguisher!
[02:58.740 --> 02:58.980]  I'm cold.
[02:59.920 --> 03:01.560]  Someone froze me with a fire extinguisher.
[03:03.420 --> 03:06.180]  I'm going to open this shelter because I need ammo.
[03:06.520 --> 03:07.140]  I am low.
[03:07.420 --> 03:07.860]  Let's do it.
[03:09.080 --> 03:09.840]  I got all the ammo.
[03:10.720 --> 03:11.160]  Ammo's gone.
[03:12.020 --> 03:12.340]  Just kidding.
[03:13.640 --> 03:15.880]  I seem to be about half done with the...
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.940]  I'm just swallowing the ammo.
[03:18.040 --> 03:19.920]  My gun is full, but I'm stealing it all from you.
[03:20.040 --> 03:21.060]  You're not getting any of it.
[03:21.480 --> 03:22.200]  No ammo.
[03:22.980 --> 03:23.540]  Oh shit!
[03:23.540 --> 03:24.100]  Heavy!
[03:24.700 --> 03:25.060]  You okay?
[03:25.320 --> 03:25.900]  Okay, heavy?
[03:27.080 --> 03:29.000]  I hate this one up here on the...
[03:29.000 --> 03:29.820]  I can't...
[03:29.820 --> 03:30.720]  It's so hard to get to.
[03:30.860 --> 03:31.860]  Working on the heavy with you.
[03:34.060 --> 03:35.900]  Oh, we got another one of these things down here.
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.240]  I think I'm going to open this one as well.
[03:45.520 --> 03:45.980]  Why not?
[03:47.120 --> 03:50.760]  What if it's like, next objective, the password was written on one of those post-its?
[03:54.160 --> 03:55.700]  Some Taskmaster type trolling?
[03:56.120 --> 03:56.520]  Okay.
[03:58.580 --> 03:59.900]  We got grenades in here.
[04:00.540 --> 04:01.900]  We need some of those.
[04:02.100 --> 04:03.660]  I spawned with a bunch of grenades this time.
[04:03.720 --> 04:04.080]  It was cool.
[04:04.520 --> 04:04.820]  Nice.
[04:05.540 --> 04:05.960]  But the heavy?
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.300]  Tons of ammo as well in here.
[04:12.940 --> 04:13.740]  Great tunes.
[04:14.020 --> 04:14.520]  This is good.
[04:14.880 --> 04:15.700]  Yeah, good music.
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.760]  Let's see what this is all about.
[04:20.300 --> 04:21.720]  Let's keep working on the hiss.
[04:24.140 --> 04:25.660]  Oh, wet hiss.
[04:32.110 --> 04:34.150]  There has to be a better way to get rid of these.
[04:34.990 --> 04:35.810]  Where's the shrapnel gun?
[04:38.710 --> 04:41.670]  I feel like my water should be doing more damage to them than it is.
[04:42.570 --> 04:43.570]  Getting them all wet.
[04:48.100 --> 04:50.200]  I can't tell if I'm doing... I guess I'm killing them.
[04:50.600 --> 04:53.180]  Anytime they shoot up...
[04:53.180 --> 04:56.540]  Like the little piles explode like you're kicking a bundle of leaves.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.560]  Still working on it.
[05:03.380 --> 05:04.380]  That didn't sound good.
[05:06.540 --> 05:08.320]  Oh yeah, we got hiss. Hiss on the floor.
[05:12.500 --> 05:13.540]  We got floor hiss?
[05:13.920 --> 05:14.480]  Floor hiss.
[05:18.060 --> 05:20.060]  So the post-it notes are evil.
[05:20.260 --> 05:23.140]  Is that a big thing in Control?
[05:23.760 --> 05:26.600]  Not specifically, but like this tone of thing is.
[05:26.780 --> 05:29.420]  Yeah, like a cursed phone or like a...
[05:29.420 --> 05:30.360]  Like absurd.
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.260]  A toaster that's gone apeshit.
[05:32.920 --> 05:34.080]  Well, that feels very Alan Wake.
[05:35.800 --> 05:37.440]  Alan Wake's talked about.
[05:39.120 --> 05:47.200]  It's one of my favorite games in terms of collectibles of like any of the warrior documents you find are always so fun to read.
[05:47.800 --> 05:53.020]  Yeah, the additional reading is great. I would say the map is one of the worst in all the video games.
[05:53.020 --> 05:54.320]  Oh, it's terrible. It's a terrible map.
[05:54.340 --> 05:55.100]  What is that, Control?
[05:55.480 --> 05:55.840]  Yeah.
[05:57.160 --> 05:57.600]  Dogshit map.
[05:57.600 --> 05:58.220]  What's bad about it?
[05:59.080 --> 06:00.320]  It's just really hard.
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.980]  Yeah, it's... the layout isn't great.
[06:03.100 --> 06:04.040]  Okay, we can call the elevator.
[06:04.620 --> 06:05.280]  I don't want to be done.
[06:05.400 --> 06:07.920]  Could you wet me because I got a post-it note in my left eye.
[06:08.360 --> 06:09.680]  Yeah, I got you. I got you, buddy.
[06:10.240 --> 06:10.780]  Thank you.
[06:13.120 --> 06:18.460]  You know how, Geoff, we were dealing with those like object to power, like the mailbox or whatever?
[06:18.940 --> 06:19.200]  Mm-hmm.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.860]  There's like written collectibles being like, there's a plane that we know is an object to power,
[06:24.860 --> 06:28.560]  but we don't know what part is, so we're going to have to de-assemble a plane.
[06:29.060 --> 06:32.840]  Like the annoyance of like, holy shit, this is so many parts,
[06:32.840 --> 06:37.240]  and we got to figure out which of these fucking things is causing whatever bullshit is happening.
[06:37.740 --> 06:38.720]  It's great lore.
[06:39.740 --> 06:42.080]  Or like this house, the rooms are constantly shifting,
[06:42.180 --> 06:45.280]  so like people complaining that the bathroom shifted out of their office,
[06:45.540 --> 06:47.580]  and they just don't know where the bathroom is anymore.
[06:50.140 --> 06:50.940]  Okay, we're good.
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.460]  We may have beaten this already.
[06:52.460 --> 06:55.280]  I think we can crank up whatever the, uh, duck rating.
[06:55.280 --> 06:58.920]  You mean the normal wasn't, uh, level one normal wasn't so tough?
[06:59.180 --> 07:01.900]  I, yeah, it seemed, I think we're kind of pros at this.
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.720]  I think we might be the best guys ever.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.940]  I think we should be kept what we wish for.
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.200]  Paper Chase is contained.
[07:13.120 --> 07:15.760]  We get any, yeah, like that was baby XP.
[07:15.920 --> 07:18.220]  Let's run that back, like at level two or three.
[07:18.860 --> 07:19.700]  Select job.
[07:20.140 --> 07:20.880]  Paper Chase.
[07:21.680 --> 07:23.080]  That was level three.
[07:23.420 --> 07:24.960]  Let's do level, or level one.
[07:25.080 --> 07:25.920]  Let's do level two.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.260]  Did you watch Severance, Andrew?
[07:28.980 --> 07:29.620]  I sure did.
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.160]  Should we double up?
[07:31.280 --> 07:33.360]  Should we, should we go from one to two and normal to hard?
[07:33.460 --> 07:34.120]  Or should we stay at normal?
[07:34.560 --> 07:35.240]  Let's do normal.
[07:35.400 --> 07:35.900]  Let's stay normal.
[07:36.040 --> 07:36.920]  Let's go level two.
[07:37.560 --> 07:38.240]  I like the way you think.
[07:39.480 --> 07:40.400]  Sorry, what were you saying, Gavin?
[07:40.880 --> 07:45.820]  Do you find it funny how Severance and Control both have a character called the Board that kind of mumbles?
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.600]  I didn't really connect the two, but that is funny.
[07:50.780 --> 07:51.180]  What?
[07:54.540 --> 07:54.940]  I...
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.400]  Severance did the thing where, like, they explain more than I wanted them to by the end of season two.
[08:01.380 --> 08:03.360]  I didn't really need a lot of the explanation.
[08:03.940 --> 08:05.660]  I enjoyed season one a lot more.
[08:06.080 --> 08:08.800]  I liked it when the work was mysterious and important.
[08:09.560 --> 08:16.620]  When they, uh, when they were in the goat room in season two, spoilers, where they were scared for their lives or whatever.
[08:16.980 --> 08:17.360]  Uh-huh.
[08:17.520 --> 08:18.660]  That was the last thing I watched.
[08:18.660 --> 08:21.580]  I think that was my least favorite part of that season, was the goat shit.
[08:21.940 --> 08:24.380]  That episode, I was like, alright, I'm out. I'm done.
[08:24.540 --> 08:29.760]  I have no idea. Maybe I'll go back and watch it now that I know that it explains too much, because I was...
[08:29.760 --> 08:31.140]  Yeah, they get into everything.
[08:32.420 --> 08:38.140]  It's funny, my least favorite episode had a reveal in it that I was like, oh, fuck, this validates this entire episode.
[08:38.320 --> 08:39.400]  This is great. Never mind.
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.920]  They do a reveal in season two that is, uh, something I hadn't even considered until the moment it presents itself.
[08:46.920 --> 08:49.180]  So does season two end on a cliffhanger?
[08:50.700 --> 08:51.480]  Uh, I'd say so.
[08:52.300 --> 08:55.040]  But they explain everything so you understand what's going on and all.
[08:55.380 --> 08:58.140]  Yeah, like the mystery of Lumen, I feel like, is pretty...
[08:58.140 --> 09:02.360]  Oh, sounds like I can just read it on Wikipedia and not have to watch it.
[09:02.620 --> 09:03.560]  Nah, you should watch it.
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.400]  Have to get Apple TV again.
[09:09.080 --> 09:09.840]  Oh, shit.
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.860]  I need a spray when you got a chance.
[09:12.100 --> 09:13.160]  Yeah, yeah, I gotcha. I gotcha.
[09:17.900 --> 09:18.440]  Thank you.
[09:18.440 --> 09:21.240]  If I do the crank thing, does it more damage? Not really.
[09:21.960 --> 09:23.840]  Water really doesn't seem like an efficient way.
[09:24.280 --> 09:27.260]  Even though I think water is the ideal way to break it, just not my water.
[09:29.700 --> 09:32.500]  I'm gonna look for water fountains and, like, sprinklers or whatever.
[09:34.060 --> 09:36.200]  It's a shame you can't guzzle your own hose.
[09:37.340 --> 09:38.380]  You'd never leave the house.
[09:41.040 --> 09:46.560]  If you look in the ceiling, sometimes there are sprinkler heads that you can shoot and they help with the...
[09:48.640 --> 09:50.060]  help with the post-it notes.
[09:54.030 --> 09:55.530]  There's, like, a Geiger counter?
[09:58.190 --> 10:01.450]  Geiger? Giger? I never know. I always feel like I'm saying it wrong.
[10:02.030 --> 10:02.210]  Yeah.
[10:02.430 --> 10:03.410]  I always Geig.
[10:05.390 --> 10:07.610]  I need to water myself down.
[10:09.070 --> 10:10.550]  Okay, we got more hiss coming in.
[10:10.630 --> 10:12.410]  Alright, we got pretty papery again.
[10:15.810 --> 10:20.730]  You know what? Grenade's pretty efficient for activating all the sprinklers on the roof.
[10:21.370 --> 10:21.730]  Oh.
[10:22.030 --> 10:24.230]  It was not my intent, but that kind of worked out.
[10:28.650 --> 10:29.010]  Oh.
[10:29.990 --> 10:30.350]  Ow.
[10:30.530 --> 10:31.310]  I got electrocuted.
[10:32.770 --> 10:33.590]  That might have been me.
[10:34.710 --> 10:36.290]  I threw a grenade upstairs.
[10:37.250 --> 10:37.730]  See what it would do.
[10:37.750 --> 10:39.770]  Andrew, can you drip some water in my face?
[10:40.090 --> 10:40.790]  Yeah, yeah, where are you?
[10:40.990 --> 10:42.650]  Okay, I got you. I got you, buddy.
[10:42.650 --> 10:43.170]  Oh, gross.
[10:45.250 --> 10:47.450]  I don't ever seem to be covered in paper.
[10:48.490 --> 10:48.810]  Really?
[10:49.650 --> 10:51.710]  I'm using my wrench on the paper, to be fair.
[10:52.410 --> 10:53.890]  Oh, I'm using the shotgun on it.
[10:55.070 --> 10:56.670]  I just didn't want to waste shotgun ammo.
[10:58.870 --> 11:01.630]  I'm locked in now on these water sprinklers.
[11:02.150 --> 11:03.130]  Sprinkler heads on the ceiling.
[11:04.030 --> 11:05.910]  Pretty useful for getting rid of it.
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.140]  Anything over here? Yeah.
[11:14.780 --> 11:17.240]  Speaking of wasting ammo, I need to go get some more.
[11:17.680 --> 11:19.340]  Yeah, I'm out. I wasted all my ammo.
[11:21.580 --> 11:23.040]  Oh, boy. I hear hiss.
[11:23.440 --> 11:24.660]  Oh, that's a shitload of hiss.
[11:27.060 --> 11:29.420]  Oh, shit. They're all going the way I was going to go.
[11:31.560 --> 11:34.080]  I could use a shower soon. My health is pretty low.
[11:36.540 --> 11:41.480]  I opened up a little safe room, if you want to use the sink.
[11:42.980 --> 11:45.260]  I found a...
[11:45.260 --> 11:47.380]  Why am I getting shocked? Oh, because I'm in water?
[11:48.000 --> 11:48.720]  Is that what's happening?
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.580]  Maybe I was just fucking up. I don't think I was.
[11:56.280 --> 11:58.620]  Oh, we got heavy. Looking at you, Andrew.
[11:59.540 --> 12:00.840]  I'm repairing the shower.
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.880]  Thank you. I'm getting some punches in.
[12:09.060 --> 12:09.720]  Oh, hell yeah.
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.040]  Oh, yeah. That's cool.
[12:14.540 --> 12:16.140]  That's repaired. Getting more ammo.
[12:17.580 --> 12:20.940]  This is a game... Control is a game that I really struggled to get back into.
[12:21.100 --> 12:25.760]  Like, I really loved it the first entire run I played through, but for the DLC, I couldn't really remember what to do.
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.020]  Yeah, I had the same problem.
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.500]  I kind of just wanted to start over, but then...
[12:33.500 --> 12:36.140]  Well, if you give it a shot, Geoff, you're lined up to be...
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.140]  Like, it's perfect for you in the sense of all that DLC is out now.
[12:39.440 --> 12:40.620]  You can just do it in one shot.
[12:40.980 --> 12:43.620]  And I assume it runs better on series than it did on...
[12:44.900 --> 12:45.400]  Yeah, probably.
[12:46.060 --> 12:46.800]  Was it a bad runner?
[12:47.660 --> 12:50.800]  No, I just did... At least it wasn't for me. Not in my memory.
[12:51.980 --> 13:00.280]  No, but it's one of those games where on PC, it had like a shit ton of RTX lighting and stuff that might have made its way to console like Cyberpunk.
[13:00.980 --> 13:02.060]  Andrew, I need wet again.
[13:02.700 --> 13:03.640]  On my way.
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.020]  Have I seen any ammo?
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.300]  Yeah, there's an ammo station at the shower. Like, right across from the shower at the start.
[13:11.400 --> 13:12.640]  Oh, I haven't even seen the shower.
[13:13.760 --> 13:14.880]  It's near the elevator.
[13:15.160 --> 13:16.860]  Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.
[13:24.250 --> 13:25.430]  Opening the door.
[13:30.110 --> 13:32.530]  Oh, shit!
[13:35.010 --> 13:35.910]  Lots of Chairman.
[13:39.210 --> 13:41.560]  We got a bunch more sticky notes we got to get out, too.
[13:43.770 --> 13:46.430]  120,000? Holy shit!
[13:47.150 --> 13:49.230]  Make it harder on normal.
[13:51.090 --> 13:51.310]  Heavy.
[13:52.710 --> 13:54.050]  I'm pretty low on ammo now.
[13:54.270 --> 13:54.730]  So am I.
[13:55.290 --> 13:57.390]  A lot of ammo over me, by me at the ammo.
[13:57.790 --> 13:58.850]  Yeah, I might go back to the shower.
[13:59.030 --> 14:00.810]  Oh, paper man! We got a paper man!
[14:07.210 --> 14:07.990]  I'm going back for ammo.
[14:08.890 --> 14:09.550]  Okay, same.
[14:10.270 --> 14:10.990]  Where's the ammo thing?
[14:11.670 --> 14:13.510]  Bullets. If you follow me, I can ping it.
[14:14.190 --> 14:14.850]  Following you.
[14:15.030 --> 14:16.370]  There it is.
[14:17.850 --> 14:19.650]  Is that just a dead lady on the floor?
[14:20.010 --> 14:20.850]  I wish I could slide.
[14:21.810 --> 14:23.590]  Oh, it's a dead guy. I didn't even notice him.
[14:25.230 --> 14:26.430]  Someone's stepping over that guy.
[14:26.630 --> 14:27.610]  Oh, fire! Fire!
[14:32.410 --> 14:34.350]  Okay, we got to get some of these chair guys down.
[14:34.970 --> 14:35.650]  I'm doing it.
[14:36.450 --> 14:37.570]  Nice. Paper man!
[14:37.710 --> 14:38.030]  I'm on the paper man.
[14:39.010 --> 14:39.370]  Grenade.
[14:41.610 --> 14:42.870]  Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[14:42.870 --> 14:43.950]  Hot, hot, hot, hot.
[14:45.830 --> 14:47.970]  Alright, should we go back over there?
[14:48.710 --> 14:48.870]  Yeah.
[14:50.970 --> 14:52.750]  Heavy to the left, heavy to the left. Got him.
[14:52.990 --> 14:53.330]  Paper man!
[14:58.610 --> 15:01.250]  Oh, they're chunking away the amount of sticky notes we need.
[15:03.790 --> 15:06.690]  What did he say? The ones on the walls are the super spreaders?
[15:08.130 --> 15:09.390]  I didn't miss that.
[15:11.830 --> 15:14.450]  He said, take care of the ones on the wall.
[15:14.450 --> 15:15.450]  They're the super spreaders.
[15:19.130 --> 15:20.230]  Another paper man!
[15:26.250 --> 15:28.570]  Getting this fire under control.
[15:29.430 --> 15:29.990]  Lovely shower.
[15:34.560 --> 15:36.740]  You can refill your grenades at the ammo station too.
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.100]  Oh, that's great to know.
[15:39.280 --> 15:39.800]  How do you do that?
[15:40.440 --> 15:41.660]  Just said you do it.
[15:41.800 --> 15:44.000]  We got an ammo station up here as well.
[15:45.140 --> 15:46.440]  Where Gavin and I are at.
[15:48.820 --> 15:50.220]  If that's the case, I'm using my shotgun.
[15:53.620 --> 15:55.080]  Oh, got more paper people.
[16:05.460 --> 16:08.120]  Why is our number dropping like crazy?
[16:08.180 --> 16:09.080]  Oh, we want it to drop.
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.280]  Yeah, and it's dropping like crazy because of the paper people.
[16:14.400 --> 16:16.140]  Come here, you fricking paper person.
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.180]  Oh, I got paper man down here.
[16:22.300 --> 16:22.840]  Come here, dickhead.
[16:23.600 --> 16:24.040]  Grenade!
[16:27.420 --> 16:29.480]  Dude, paper got fucking me up.
[16:29.840 --> 16:32.540]  Not really a lot of work for my wrenchman abilities.
[16:35.080 --> 16:36.300]  Got a shelter down here.
[16:37.460 --> 16:41.960]  We should take a little peek before we progress to make sure that we're not missing any upgrades or whatever.
[16:45.900 --> 16:48.020]  Uh-oh. Bad times.
[16:49.400 --> 16:51.140]  Oh, shelter. Opening a shelter.
[16:57.440 --> 16:58.940]  Oh shit, bust your man.
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.380]  Oh yeah, they're coming into the shelter with me. That's not good.
[17:05.220 --> 17:06.800]  Oh, more paper. More paper.
[17:07.680 --> 17:08.540]  I need help!
[17:11.970 --> 17:12.470]  Oh fuck.
[17:13.970 --> 17:14.330]  No!
[17:17.550 --> 17:17.910]  Grenades!
[17:18.250 --> 17:20.250]  Oh god, I went down in front of the shower. God damn it.
[17:20.590 --> 17:22.250]  Okay, I'll be there in a sec. Sorry.
[17:22.890 --> 17:23.710]  Be there in a sec, Gav.
[17:23.970 --> 17:24.810]  There's so many of them.
[17:24.990 --> 17:26.210]  So many enemies right here.
[17:26.210 --> 17:28.830]  Yeah, we got the postulman really messed it all up.
[17:28.970 --> 17:30.770]  Oh, great electricity you ever did that.
[17:30.930 --> 17:32.030]  That was me.
[17:32.250 --> 17:32.870]  Running to you.
[17:33.510 --> 17:34.970]  I'm gonna have to go around the other side.
[17:35.270 --> 17:37.090]  Oh no, but that's where that guy is.
[17:42.030 --> 17:44.750]  Don't hit me, don't hit me, people. Don't hit me, bad guys. Don't hit me, bad guys.
[17:45.110 --> 17:46.750]  I got Gavin up. Oh, I'm papered so bad.
[17:48.350 --> 17:49.690]  I can barely see.
[17:51.370 --> 17:51.930]  I'm down.
[17:55.860 --> 17:56.320]  I'm down.
[17:58.240 --> 17:59.420]  Oh, you killed the postulman.
[17:59.600 --> 18:00.400]  Oh, Geoff, what a grenade!
[18:04.030 --> 18:08.490]  I think your grenade activated that thing. It's a distraction.
[18:09.090 --> 18:10.170]  They're attracted to the music.
[18:10.550 --> 18:11.170]  Yeah, Gav, what's up?
[18:11.570 --> 18:14.730]  I gotta get the fucking fire off of you first. I can't get to you.
[18:17.030 --> 18:18.510]  I don't think you can, can you?
[18:18.910 --> 18:19.910]  Yeah, yeah, I can.
[18:20.130 --> 18:20.350]  Okay.
[18:20.490 --> 18:21.650]  Takes a long time. I'm doing it right now.
[18:22.430 --> 18:25.090]  Oh, the postulman guy is fucking you up.
[18:30.580 --> 18:32.220]  Oh, nice spin on him.
[18:35.240 --> 18:35.620]  Oh, you did it.
[18:35.640 --> 18:38.100]  I can't believe you're just taking him out. Nice, Geoff.
[18:38.240 --> 18:39.800]  Oh, maybe just run through the fire?
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.620]  We got another heavy.
[18:45.980 --> 18:47.440]  Did you swap to a shotgun, Geoff?
[18:47.900 --> 18:48.100]  Yeah.
[18:48.540 --> 18:48.920]  Nice.
[18:50.360 --> 18:51.160]  Shoot water.
[18:51.600 --> 18:51.920]  Getting Gavin.
[18:55.200 --> 18:55.680]  Thank you.
[18:56.260 --> 18:56.540]  San Francisco? No.
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.200]  Going back in the fire.
[18:59.480 --> 19:00.320]  Where's Francisco?
[19:01.400 --> 19:01.800]  Holy shit.
[19:04.020 --> 19:05.220]  Is this him? Is this Frank?
[19:08.220 --> 19:10.140]  Oh, he's invisible. He's invisible.
[19:13.120 --> 19:14.180]  I need to have a shower.
[19:14.200 --> 19:15.560]  Holy shit, he can fly and he's invisible.
[19:20.640 --> 19:21.560]  Oh, it's like a bird.
[19:22.280 --> 19:22.940]  Super visible.
[19:24.560 --> 19:26.300]  Is the shower broke? Shit.
[19:26.780 --> 19:27.580]  You gotta repair it.
[19:27.880 --> 19:28.980]  You gotta repair it. You're the repairman.
[19:28.980 --> 19:31.660]  Oh, I climbed it.
[19:33.960 --> 19:35.100]  I'm trying to repair it.
[19:35.620 --> 19:36.160]  We're all down.
[19:37.460 --> 19:40.340]  I just got an achievement called Hitchcock Moment.
[19:40.540 --> 19:41.860]  Become down while showering.
[19:43.980 --> 19:46.560]  Okay, I'm gonna just respawn and then head back here.
[19:50.940 --> 19:51.840]  You know what?
[19:52.020 --> 19:53.340]  Yeah, you can...
[19:53.340 --> 19:55.460]  You gotta look into the shower to repair it, Gavin.
[19:55.520 --> 19:55.860]  Just so you know.
[19:56.860 --> 19:58.840]  Yeah, I got one swing on it and then I was just hitting...
[19:58.840 --> 19:59.320]  Oh, okay.
[20:01.020 --> 20:02.380]  Well, like the back of someone else.
[20:02.840 --> 20:03.440]  Getting somebody.
[20:03.800 --> 20:04.340]  I think I'm getting you, Gavin.
[20:04.340 --> 20:07.180]  Oh, now I'm finally getting the paper clips. I get it.
[20:07.480 --> 20:09.640]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[20:09.640 --> 20:11.220]  Oh, fuck. It's all you, Gav.
[20:13.220 --> 20:15.540]  I'm really hurting. I'm really hurting.
[20:15.720 --> 20:16.540]  I'm trying to get Geoff up.
[20:16.680 --> 20:17.460]  Okay, I'm down now.
[20:17.700 --> 20:18.060]  I'm up.
[20:19.940 --> 20:20.760]  Okay, and I drew up.
[20:23.180 --> 20:24.900]  Soon as I'm up, I can get this fire.
[20:27.200 --> 20:27.640]  Okay.
[20:28.460 --> 20:29.520]  I have no ammo.
[20:31.880 --> 20:34.820]  We gotta deal with fucking Francisco or whatever.
[20:39.660 --> 20:40.720]  Oh, my God.
[20:42.280 --> 20:45.220]  Oh, I just badly need ammo. Holy shit.
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.660]  There's ammo right across from the shower.
[20:49.960 --> 20:50.940]  I can't move. I'm froze.
[20:55.720 --> 20:57.200]  Oh, no. I gotta get back in the shower.
[20:57.280 --> 20:58.080]  Down in the ammo hole.
[20:58.240 --> 20:58.680]  Shit.
[20:58.940 --> 20:59.720]  I'm getting you.
[21:01.440 --> 21:02.460]  I'm down in the shower.
[21:02.860 --> 21:02.980]  Shit.
[21:03.100 --> 21:03.960]  I'm gonna go to you next.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.080]  Is it not fixed?
[21:06.260 --> 21:07.100]  Oh, fuck.
[21:08.500 --> 21:09.100]  I'm down.
[21:11.360 --> 21:11.960]  I gotta get out of here.
[21:12.000 --> 21:13.180]  I think it might be time to redeploy.
[21:14.560 --> 21:14.920]  Oh.
[21:15.120 --> 21:15.780]  Fixing the shower.
[21:16.660 --> 21:18.060]  Oh, Birdman. Okay.
[21:18.480 --> 21:19.180]  Alright, redeploying.
[21:19.360 --> 21:21.020]  We gotta deal with Francisco.
[21:21.980 --> 21:22.820]  Should we just redeploy?
[21:23.360 --> 21:23.600]  Yeah.
[21:25.740 --> 21:26.480]  You with me, Andrew?
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.320]  Yeah, I'm with you. I'm going to Gavin way.
[21:33.420 --> 21:35.460]  I'm getting shots on him.
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.720]  I'm fighting Francisco. Is Francisco invisible?
[21:40.260 --> 21:41.720]  Yeah, he's like the bird guy.
[21:42.060 --> 21:43.780]  I might have killed him.
[21:44.460 --> 21:45.900]  No, he's still half health.
[21:46.980 --> 21:48.100]  I see. He doesn't.
[21:52.290 --> 21:53.530]  He's visible again.
[21:56.010 --> 21:57.130]  Now he's not invisible.
[22:01.250 --> 22:02.590]  On the stairs, coming down.
[22:02.890 --> 22:03.730]  On me, on me, on me.
[22:07.800 --> 22:10.000]  Shit, they're spitting paper everywhere.
[22:13.040 --> 22:14.680]  Okay, putting more shots in on Francisco.
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.200]  Oh, he's almost dead. Almost got him.
[22:20.720 --> 22:21.620]  Down in the shower.
[22:22.800 --> 22:23.540]  Okay, he's down.
[22:24.520 --> 22:25.040]  Getting you up.
[22:28.890 --> 22:31.970]  Okay, as soon as you get Gavin up, let's get the fuck out of here.
[22:32.250 --> 22:32.350]  Alright, let's go.
[22:32.350 --> 22:33.550]  I don't want to deal with another Francisco.
[22:34.510 --> 22:35.730]  I got notes all over me.
[22:37.010 --> 22:38.230]  Okay, group up on me.
[22:42.010 --> 22:42.730]  You good?
[22:44.250 --> 22:44.270]  Yeah.
[22:44.670 --> 22:45.650]  Okay, let's go.
[22:45.850 --> 22:46.510]  Sprinting straight through.
[22:46.570 --> 22:47.150]  Activate this exit.
[22:49.070 --> 22:51.230]  I need to get in that shower as soon as we get over there.
[22:52.570 --> 22:54.710]  If you want to go hit that, I'm going to hop in the shower real quick.
[22:55.430 --> 22:55.810]  Hitting it.
[22:56.830 --> 22:57.470]  Thank you.
[23:01.800 --> 23:02.640]  Oh, it's leaving.
[23:05.060 --> 23:06.400]  We're good to go. Nice.
[23:06.760 --> 23:06.880]  Okay.
[23:10.560 --> 23:11.280]  Oh, shit.
[23:11.280 --> 23:12.220]  Wow.
[23:12.340 --> 23:13.160]  No, it opened.
[23:13.260 --> 23:14.120]  Who did that?
[23:14.460 --> 23:15.160]  Shut the door.
[23:16.240 --> 23:18.160]  Close the freaking door.
[23:19.140 --> 23:19.640]  Gavin, get in.
[23:19.720 --> 23:20.000]  Get in.
[23:20.440 --> 23:21.020]  Gavin.
[23:22.940 --> 23:23.340]  Gavin.
[23:25.520 --> 23:27.460]  We got to get the door closed.
[23:27.640 --> 23:27.820]  Okay.
[23:28.280 --> 23:29.060]  God damn.
[23:31.360 --> 23:32.560]  Up is go.
[23:32.900 --> 23:33.180]  Okay.
[23:36.240 --> 23:38.100]  Well, we don't next time.
[23:38.980 --> 23:42.480]  Let's bump the level on that because I want us to get to the boss.
[23:42.600 --> 23:43.500]  There's a final boss.
[23:44.120 --> 23:45.560]  That is fantastic.
[23:45.940 --> 23:46.160]  Okay.
[23:46.240 --> 23:47.000]  Let's win that back.
[23:47.540 --> 23:47.920]  Okay.
[23:48.060 --> 23:49.720]  So we want to do level three now.
[23:49.960 --> 23:50.980]  Paper chase level three.
[23:51.780 --> 23:52.360]  All right.
[23:52.460 --> 23:52.740]  Normal.
[23:53.160 --> 23:53.500]  I guess.
[23:54.060 --> 23:55.260]  Before we hop in here.
[23:55.940 --> 23:56.620]  All right.
[23:56.760 --> 23:57.980]  Select job.
[23:58.080 --> 23:58.920]  Paper chase.
[23:59.080 --> 23:59.780]  Let me make sure I got that right.
[23:59.980 --> 24:00.400]  Normal.
[24:00.720 --> 24:01.160]  Corruption.
[24:02.100 --> 24:03.660]  I can't change the corruption.
[24:03.900 --> 24:05.020]  So clearance level three.
[24:05.160 --> 24:05.500]  Normal.
[24:05.920 --> 24:06.240]  Select job.
[24:06.240 --> 24:06.560]  Okay.
[24:07.180 --> 24:08.920]  Set off my watches loud Mia.
[24:12.840 --> 24:13.560]  That's awesome.
[24:14.160 --> 24:14.400]  New.
[24:15.800 --> 24:16.240]  Good.
[24:16.920 --> 24:18.140]  I'm so happy we're doing this guys.
[24:18.420 --> 24:18.700]  You have no idea.
[24:18.700 --> 24:19.040]  Yeah.
[24:19.260 --> 24:19.580]  It's fun.
[24:20.860 --> 24:23.340]  Today is hotter in England than it is in Austin in June.
[24:23.380 --> 24:24.360]  That's crazy.
[24:24.660 --> 24:25.260]  That's nuts.
[24:26.180 --> 24:27.280]  Are you already in England?
[24:27.940 --> 24:28.220]  No.
[24:29.900 --> 24:30.480]  Are you?
[24:31.580 --> 24:33.240]  No, but I'm not talking about the weather in England.
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.020]  That's a great point.
[24:42.140 --> 24:42.900]  Good guy.
[24:43.160 --> 24:44.100]  I'm putting out this fire.
[24:49.760 --> 24:55.500]  How many things when you say it after the response of everyone else, are you just like, I don't know why I said anything?
[24:57.320 --> 24:58.500]  All the time.
[25:00.500 --> 25:02.020]  Which is fine in normal life.
[25:02.120 --> 25:04.980]  But when you have a podcast, it's like kind of have to say stuff.
[25:05.580 --> 25:05.940]  Yeah.
[25:07.520 --> 25:08.640]  Having to say stuff.
[25:09.660 --> 25:10.840]  And then saying stuff.
[25:13.380 --> 25:14.940]  You're like, well, I had to say something.
[25:16.300 --> 25:17.620]  That's going to be my excuse.
[25:17.840 --> 25:19.420]  The next time I just say something to bomb.
[25:26.360 --> 25:28.540]  It's also just like the tone of things.
[25:28.680 --> 25:32.100]  Like when you say things to be like, oh, that didn't come out the way I wanted it to.
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.140]  I've been thinking ever since we recorded it like three weeks ago, we're playing Roadcraft.
[25:37.180 --> 25:38.700]  I called you an idiot, Gavin.
[25:38.800 --> 25:41.600]  And I went, that was way harsher than I meant it to come across.
[25:41.820 --> 25:45.480]  And I just, I felt bad about it privately for like three weeks.
[25:45.620 --> 25:49.740]  Or I'll just think like, ah, that that came out so much more aggressively than I meant.
[25:50.080 --> 25:51.080]  I should have said fool.
[25:51.180 --> 25:51.580]  I should have.
[25:51.780 --> 25:53.300]  There was a harshness in the tone.
[25:54.380 --> 25:54.600]  Idiot.
[25:54.660 --> 25:59.660]  It's like, I feel like as a kid, it's like one of the go to's of like the first kind of insulting thing you learn.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.600]  But as you get older, it becomes more offensive somehow.
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.420]  Well, because you meet real idiots.
[26:05.640 --> 26:05.840]  Yeah.
[26:06.040 --> 26:07.140]  Throughout the course of your life.
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.680]  And you're like, no, the idiot's the guy who was the teller at the bank.
[26:11.740 --> 26:12.480]  What are you talking about?
[26:12.560 --> 26:14.560]  Does he think I'm as dumb as the guy at the bank yesterday?
[26:17.580 --> 26:23.080]  I called Michael an idiot over an argument in Minecraft once and I felt bad about it afterwards.
[26:26.640 --> 26:28.200]  But to be fair to me, he was being an idiot.
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.320]  Dude, I had a weird thing where I was hanging out yesterday at that homebrew event.
[26:36.480 --> 26:43.240]  And I was at a point where I was hanging out with Michael, Alfredo, and Ray all at the same time.
[26:43.340 --> 26:43.840]  And I was like, this is...
[26:44.500 --> 26:45.620]  Almost had a full reunion.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.860]  I feel like I'm reading somebody's fan fiction.
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.600]  So who sucked off who in reality?
[26:53.960 --> 26:54.760]  Oh, Alfredo.
[26:55.100 --> 26:57.160]  You wouldn't know, but he is a power bottom.
[26:59.700 --> 27:02.040]  He really likes to give. He likes to receive.
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.940]  I need more ammo.
[27:06.460 --> 27:07.280]  Give me the ammo.
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.200]  It's a really fun grab ammo visual.
[27:13.400 --> 27:14.620]  But you gotta like...
[27:14.620 --> 27:16.660]  You're just grabbing it by the handfuls.
[27:19.580 --> 27:20.980]  I'm gonna open up the shelter door.
[27:21.660 --> 27:24.560]  Like a game where you can say, be happy I got a shower off the poster.
[27:28.060 --> 27:29.500]  Okay, we got another shredder.
[27:29.620 --> 27:33.120]  Oh no guys, every enemy spawned.
[27:33.140 --> 27:33.760]  Including a big...
[27:33.760 --> 27:35.860]  Oh no, a black ball.
[27:36.200 --> 27:36.660]  Beach ball?
[27:37.760 --> 27:38.740]  Giant beach ball.
[27:39.880 --> 27:41.160]  Giant beach ball.
[27:42.900 --> 27:48.420]  I love these games because you guys will say an enemy that I'm not near and be like, I gotta see what's going on with that.
[27:48.500 --> 27:49.420]  That sounds crazy.
[27:50.340 --> 27:53.180]  This game delivers in its character.
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.740]  Oh, there's another beach ball.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.160]  They don't have proper names.
[27:56.460 --> 27:57.580]  Oh, beach ball!
[27:59.200 --> 28:00.840]  Ow, beach ball blew up my face.
[28:01.500 --> 28:02.740]  How do you make grenades with this?
[28:04.200 --> 28:04.960]  How do you make them?
[28:05.600 --> 28:07.060]  You said you could get grenades from the ammo station.
[28:07.080 --> 28:08.160]  Oh, it's what it told me.
[28:08.880 --> 28:10.780]  Maybe it might be an update I have.
[28:11.120 --> 28:14.220]  Yeah, maybe it's a perk that he has or something related to his class.
[28:14.380 --> 28:16.200]  Or, maybe I misheard him.
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.120]  Or misread it.
[28:17.300 --> 28:18.760]  Maybe I'm just fucking stupid too.
[28:19.760 --> 28:20.540]  Like an idiot?
[28:21.840 --> 28:22.760]  I wouldn't say that.
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.060]  You know what? I felt a little harsh.
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.000]  Sorry to say.
[28:29.280 --> 28:30.700]  Oh, we still gotta kill post-it notes, huh?
[28:33.000 --> 28:33.600]  Uh, yes.
[28:34.480 --> 28:35.760]  We're chunking them. We're doing good.
[28:35.820 --> 28:38.520]  I'm gonna open another sheltered door over here.
[28:38.620 --> 28:40.720]  So get ready, we're gonna have more beach balls, I assume.
[28:42.180 --> 28:44.080]  God, freaking post-it right in my eye again.
[28:44.780 --> 28:46.840]  Makes me feel like I'm playing with a migraine.
[28:48.060 --> 28:49.300]  Would you de-post me?
[28:49.300 --> 28:51.140]  Yeah, I'm posting you.
[28:51.200 --> 28:51.620]  Sucks to see.
[28:57.950 --> 28:59.210]  Holy shit, back.
[28:59.790 --> 29:00.810]  Anything cool in here?
[29:00.970 --> 29:01.570]  Some ammo?
[29:03.430 --> 29:04.550]  Got a grenade, maybe?
[29:05.830 --> 29:08.550]  These shock grenades are so fucking cool.
[29:08.830 --> 29:09.550]  I'm so glad I switched.
[29:10.110 --> 29:11.210]  Yeah, I should look into this.
[29:12.350 --> 29:16.050]  It doesn't necessarily kill everybody, but it freezes them all in place for a little while.
[29:16.750 --> 29:18.710]  Great for me when I'm reloading my shotgun.
[29:20.070 --> 29:21.970]  Where are more sprinkler heads?
[29:25.630 --> 29:28.030]  I've still never seen the sprinkler heads you're talking about.
[29:28.190 --> 29:28.470]  Oh, really?
[29:28.670 --> 29:30.130]  Just throw a grenade in the room and you'll see it.
[29:31.630 --> 29:33.770]  Oh, you mean they just come down from the ceiling?
[29:34.070 --> 29:34.950]  Okay, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[29:35.530 --> 29:36.610]  They're not fictional either.
[29:38.230 --> 29:39.470]  I realize that made me sound super dumb.
[29:39.670 --> 29:41.990]  I've seen water coming from the ceiling, I just realized.
[29:42.090 --> 29:43.870]  I've just never seen a sprinkler head that I could shoot.
[29:44.490 --> 29:46.030]  That's what I was meaning to say.
[29:46.490 --> 29:47.330]  They're flash red.
[29:50.210 --> 29:51.190]  And they're on the ceiling.
[29:53.730 --> 29:56.910]  Maybe that's my problem, I'm usually looking on the ground.
[29:57.830 --> 30:03.450]  Your Slow Mo Guys video, Gavin, of how to activate a sprinkler head has me terrified of sprinkler heads now.
[30:03.970 --> 30:04.450]  Why's that?
[30:04.830 --> 30:06.510]  You just made them look so fragile.
[30:08.490 --> 30:12.050]  Whenever I see one in the wild, I'm like, I could break that. I could make that happen.
[30:12.190 --> 30:16.010]  I mean, you could certainly dig one if you hit it with some furniture or something.
[30:17.770 --> 30:20.550]  And my video was only powered by a hose.
[30:20.910 --> 30:24.270]  Really, they've got like five times the pressure of what I showed.
[30:26.410 --> 30:29.570]  It'll do about a million dollars worth of damage to an office real fast.
[30:30.970 --> 30:31.990]  I can attest.
[30:33.490 --> 30:36.650]  It was a nice office, but how did that cost a million dollars?
[30:37.010 --> 30:37.790]  Oh, it wasn't a million.
[30:37.950 --> 30:40.290]  I mean, even still.
[30:40.550 --> 30:43.810]  You know, I genuinely don't know, but it was a lot.
[30:43.810 --> 30:49.830]  I realize I'm backtracking on what I'm saying here, but I think it genuinely might have been somewhere in the neighborhood of like 250k.
[30:51.230 --> 30:53.570]  But I don't know for sure.
[30:54.270 --> 30:56.050]  It just feels right. Trevor would know.
[30:57.290 --> 30:58.310]  He'd build a house for that.
[30:58.510 --> 30:59.950]  He's the one who wasted all the money.
[31:06.350 --> 31:08.470]  I'm kidding. It wasn't even our money.
[31:12.650 --> 31:14.350]  Oh, we don't need to kill...
[31:14.350 --> 31:16.970]  I miss that we went to the next zone.
[31:17.370 --> 31:20.270]  That we got that marker. I'm shooting post-it notes like, huh.
[31:20.630 --> 31:21.790]  Get there eventually.
[31:24.410 --> 31:25.650]  Oh, so many chair people.
[31:25.770 --> 31:26.510]  Oh, bad room, bad room.
[31:28.450 --> 31:29.250]  Definitely grenades.
[31:29.870 --> 31:32.870]  Okay, I'm getting water on us. I feel like we're all going to get postied.
[31:33.770 --> 31:35.030]  I'm getting fucking... yeah.
[31:36.950 --> 31:38.670]  Oh, so many chairs above us.
[31:41.170 --> 31:43.490]  Fuck, fuck, fuck. Running in, running in to you guys.
[31:46.410 --> 31:48.210]  Behind us is really bad.
[31:48.890 --> 31:49.330]  Oh, yeah it is.
[31:50.290 --> 31:50.870]  Anyone got a grenade?
[31:52.050 --> 31:53.250]  I think I just used them all.
[31:55.430 --> 31:55.790]  Ow.
[31:57.070 --> 31:57.990]  Oh, floating guy.
[31:58.230 --> 32:01.210]  Oh man, sometimes when you shoot a post-it man, he splits into two post-it men.
[32:01.490 --> 32:01.850]  Really?
[32:02.470 --> 32:02.830]  Yeah.
[32:03.290 --> 32:03.750]  Oh shit.
[32:03.830 --> 32:05.450]  No, never mind three, four post-it men.
[32:05.550 --> 32:07.530]  Oh my god, they keep multiplying.
[32:07.530 --> 32:10.530]  I'm watering them. I don't know if that'll fuck that up, but...
[32:11.390 --> 32:12.750]  At least you won't be able to read the passwords.
[32:13.010 --> 32:13.470]  Oh, he's doing it again.
[32:14.610 --> 32:15.990]  Oh, that fricking shower broke.
[32:17.810 --> 32:18.690]  Thank god you can fix it.
[32:19.010 --> 32:19.130]  Yeah.
[32:19.430 --> 32:20.230]  Shelter's this way, huh?
[32:20.730 --> 32:21.830]  I spent a lot of my time just sat in the shower.
[32:21.830 --> 32:23.150]  Oh, so many more floating guys.
[32:24.370 --> 32:29.190]  I need... if we could get a repair on electricity over here.
[32:29.790 --> 32:30.250]  Oh no.
[32:30.290 --> 32:30.790]  Okay, I'll do it.
[32:30.810 --> 32:31.450]  I'm so far away.
[32:33.330 --> 32:34.130]  Oh, we got heavies.
[32:34.130 --> 32:35.530]  Heavies away from you.
[32:38.210 --> 32:39.790]  Oh, I need ammo so bad.
[32:40.190 --> 32:40.470]  Pushing my shit off.
[32:42.390 --> 32:43.790]  Okay, working on the heavies.
[32:43.810 --> 32:44.690]  Guys, I found a half a pizza.
[32:45.170 --> 32:49.550]  These heavies feel stronger. I don't know if they are, or I suck more, but they are not going down easy.
[32:49.950 --> 32:53.390]  Oh, I'm getting so paper covered. I need to get the paper off me.
[32:53.870 --> 32:55.810]  Oh, I might go down here, boys.
[32:56.490 --> 32:57.070]  Yep, down.
[32:57.790 --> 32:58.750]  Okay, we gotta go to Geoff.
[33:00.470 --> 33:01.450]  I'm in a sprinkler.
[33:01.970 --> 33:03.410]  Okay, running to Geoff.
[33:05.590 --> 33:07.250]  There's a big boy.
[33:07.330 --> 33:08.330]  Oh shit, invisible guy.
[33:08.590 --> 33:09.390]  It's a sputoid.
[33:10.750 --> 33:11.610]  I'm down too.
[33:11.910 --> 33:13.950]  There's a video game here called Shum.
[33:18.610 --> 33:18.970]  Ow.
[33:19.330 --> 33:20.010]  Did you say Spum?
[33:22.130 --> 33:23.010]  Spummer the game?
[33:24.250 --> 33:26.090]  Alright, I dropped all my stuff in the safe room.
[33:27.130 --> 33:28.010]  I'm redeploying.
[33:30.730 --> 33:32.050]  Should I redeploy or just wait?
[33:32.270 --> 33:33.130]  Yeah, no, no, redeploy.
[33:33.990 --> 33:35.110]  Yeah, it's bad out there.
[33:36.730 --> 33:37.490]  Bad, man.
[33:40.510 --> 33:41.510]  Okay, I'm working on guys.
[33:43.630 --> 33:45.770]  Oh, I spawned in a freaking pool table.
[33:47.170 --> 33:48.590]  You spawned in a pool table?
[33:48.970 --> 33:49.230]  Yeah.
[33:55.730 --> 33:56.250]  Eh.
[33:57.170 --> 33:58.910]  Oh, was that the room I died in?
[33:59.390 --> 34:00.790]  Can I get all my stuff back then?
[34:02.270 --> 34:03.030]  The fuck?
[34:05.350 --> 34:06.370]  Oh shit.
[34:07.850 --> 34:09.010]  This guy hurts.
[34:09.390 --> 34:10.830]  This fucking bird guy.
[34:11.030 --> 34:12.090]  Oh, I became paper.
[34:12.390 --> 34:13.210]  I'm down.
[34:14.790 --> 34:16.470]  Wish I could turn the arcade camera on.
[34:16.490 --> 34:17.170]  Alright, I should probably help.
[34:18.090 --> 34:18.850]  I'm outside.
[34:19.970 --> 34:20.930]  There's a bird man.
[34:22.290 --> 34:23.550]  He's spitting stuff.
[34:25.450 --> 34:25.590]  Alright.
[34:26.790 --> 34:27.230]  Got you.
[34:27.850 --> 34:28.610]  Thank you.
[34:32.900 --> 34:34.920]  That bird guy is such a problem.
[34:35.280 --> 34:36.500]  Okay, he's in the safe house now.
[34:37.900 --> 34:38.500]  Shut the door.
[34:43.220 --> 34:44.080]  Where did he go?
[34:45.060 --> 34:45.720]  Oh, bird man.
[34:47.200 --> 34:48.360]  He's a problem.
[34:48.540 --> 34:49.200]  Careful with him.
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.220]  Oh, get him off of him.
[34:51.420 --> 34:53.560]  Yeah, good move.
[34:53.980 --> 34:54.440]  Is he down?
[34:55.060 --> 34:56.940]  Andrew, you need to get some water while you're in.
[34:57.220 --> 34:58.160]  Come back to the safe room and drink.
[35:01.140 --> 35:01.460]  Drinking.
[35:03.620 --> 35:04.940]  Always forget that this is in here.
[35:04.940 --> 35:05.400]  Thanks, Geoff.
[35:09.950 --> 35:11.590]  We're making good sticky progress.
[35:14.130 --> 35:15.090]  Five or six more
[35:15.090 --> 35:16.230]  paper men and we're good.
[35:17.510 --> 35:18.950]  I want to go back to the shower
[35:18.950 --> 35:20.810]  just because I know I dropped shit.
[35:21.870 --> 35:22.290]  Let's do it.
[35:22.850 --> 35:23.890]  Oh no, there it is.
[35:26.950 --> 35:27.630]  Got it back.
[35:27.790 --> 35:28.610]  Sorry about that.
[35:29.090 --> 35:34.970]  Okay, I'm going to get this fire out.
[35:34.970 --> 35:36.550]  Would you drop the...
[35:36.550 --> 35:38.110]  Shoot the post-it note off my face, please?
[35:38.390 --> 35:38.910]  Yeah, absolutely.
[35:41.250 --> 35:42.930]  I just love that problem
[35:42.930 --> 35:43.650]  for some reason.
[35:44.830 --> 35:48.630]  We're going to find more paper.
[35:49.990 --> 35:51.090]  Oh, this seems bad.
[35:51.150 --> 35:51.870]  What's going on in here?
[35:52.250 --> 35:52.990]  It's bad.
[35:53.670 --> 35:54.930]  Sounds bad. Let's go to Geoff.
[35:55.930 --> 35:56.490]  Oh, yeah.
[36:00.740 --> 36:03.360]  I hate these post-it notes in my face.
[36:03.620 --> 36:05.100]  Ah! Got even more of them.
[36:05.100 --> 36:07.240]  Oh shit, look at all the paper men.
[36:07.240 --> 36:08.720]  There's like five paper men.
[36:11.640 --> 36:12.560]  We want that.
[36:13.240 --> 36:14.860]  I turned on a room that's got shit in it.
[36:17.760 --> 36:19.120]  Got migraine face again.
[36:20.060 --> 36:21.420]  Do you want to come in here? There's so much paper.
[36:24.180 --> 36:25.320]  Making them all wet.
[36:27.500 --> 36:28.940]  Washing my eyes out.
[36:30.040 --> 36:31.020]  Can we almost have enough paper?
[36:31.500 --> 36:31.860]  Paper.
[36:34.360 --> 36:36.020]  Oh, there's so many paper men in here.
[36:36.580 --> 36:36.720]  Yeah.
[36:39.180 --> 36:40.440]  Alright, we can probably kill one more
[36:40.440 --> 36:41.040]  and then we'll be done.
[36:42.540 --> 36:43.180]  Here we go.
[36:43.880 --> 36:45.940]  Oh no, I shouldn't have walked in that room.
[36:46.620 --> 36:47.380]  Here, I got you.
[36:49.320 --> 36:50.380]  Opening the next door.
[36:54.310 --> 36:56.290]  Guys, we've got to kill sticky notes.
[36:56.830 --> 36:57.050]  Okay.
[36:58.730 --> 36:59.790]  I'm going to need more ammo.
[37:02.930 --> 37:04.970]  Here, Geoff, do you want to head to Gavin?
[37:05.070 --> 37:05.450]  Are you with me?
[37:10.540 --> 37:11.580]  I'm about to run out of ammo.
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.680]  Yeah, you might want to come back to where I'm at.
[37:15.980 --> 37:16.540]  Coming back.
[37:17.280 --> 37:18.420]  I'll hold them off for you.
[37:19.340 --> 37:21.660]  We only need 2.5 million paper.
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.640]  Yeah, this would be a great spot for grenades
[37:26.640 --> 37:27.360]  if anybody had any.
[37:29.700 --> 37:32.160]  Oh, he just temporarily was in the zone
[37:32.160 --> 37:33.040]  for grabbing ammo there.
[37:34.620 --> 37:34.940]  Okay.
[37:35.940 --> 37:38.000]  If anybody wants to come... I'm trying to hold them back
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.620]  so you guys can get ammo. If anybody wants to come replace me, I need to...
[37:40.620 --> 37:41.960]  Yeah, you go. You go. I'm on you.
[37:42.140 --> 37:42.320]  Alright.
[37:45.780 --> 37:46.100]  Rotate.
[37:47.440 --> 37:48.160]  Outside of the
[37:48.160 --> 37:49.540]  pustule guy, we're clear.
[37:52.380 --> 37:53.760]  Oh, it's not even a pustule. It's just heavy.
[37:55.380 --> 37:56.500]  Okay, we're clear this way.
[37:56.880 --> 37:58.040]  I'm going to keep pushing forward.
[37:58.980 --> 37:59.460]  I'm with you.
[38:02.160 --> 38:03.500]  More upgrade material.
[38:07.840 --> 38:08.480]  Clear.
[38:09.020 --> 38:11.840]  I don't typically like games where enemies
[38:11.840 --> 38:13.640]  can just spawn right next to you, but
[38:13.640 --> 38:14.540]  somehow it's fun.
[38:15.340 --> 38:16.720]  Coming to you, Geoff.
[38:16.840 --> 38:17.800]  I'm trying to get to you.
[38:19.700 --> 38:20.020]  Gotcha.
[38:21.640 --> 38:22.380]  Thank you.
[38:22.640 --> 38:24.300]  Okay, we got people in chairs.
[38:27.160 --> 38:29.300]  Grabbing some more ammo over here.
[38:31.000 --> 38:31.780]  Get rid of
[38:31.780 --> 38:33.000]  the chair guys.
[38:33.620 --> 38:35.320]  Oh yeah, if you could repair this
[38:35.320 --> 38:36.020]  shower.
[38:37.120 --> 38:38.120]  Paper, paper, paper.
[38:43.860 --> 38:44.600]  Oh, it's like
[38:44.600 --> 38:46.260]  a wave of them coming in from the back.
[38:46.960 --> 38:48.660]  Yeah, they were looking up my ass
[38:48.660 --> 38:49.540]  when I was trying to get to you.
[38:51.180 --> 38:52.500]  Okay, got it. Let's keep pushing.
[38:54.660 --> 38:55.540]  There's the boss!
[38:56.420 --> 38:57.060]  Frickin' hell.
[38:58.300 --> 38:58.860]  Oh no.
[38:59.860 --> 39:00.580]  Okay, we gotta
[39:00.580 --> 39:01.740]  upgrade these things.
[39:04.320 --> 39:06.080]  Gonna start flipping switches.
[39:06.780 --> 39:07.780]  Flip the one on the right, Geoff.
[39:09.480 --> 39:10.840]  Oh, I'm so weak already.
[39:11.440 --> 39:11.980]  I can't get up.
[39:12.320 --> 39:12.880]  Oh no, I'm falling!
[39:14.020 --> 39:15.380]  Did you fall in a hole?
[39:17.120 --> 39:17.920]  Geoff died.
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.780]  Okay, uh, two things flip.
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.520]  Oh, I got some wrenches.
[39:26.640 --> 39:27.560]  I'm gonna go to the wrench.
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.560]  Yep, yep, yep.
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.140]  Ah shit, it's his city.
[39:31.900 --> 39:32.180]  Yep.
[39:34.460 --> 39:35.600]  Repair it, repair it, repair it,
[39:35.640 --> 39:36.020]  repair it.
[39:36.100 --> 39:38.220]  Okay, we got another one in the middle.
[39:40.040 --> 39:40.600]  Beach balls!
[39:42.600 --> 39:43.160]  I'm down!
[39:45.260 --> 39:46.260]  Guys, I'm trying to get back to you.
[39:46.320 --> 39:47.000]  I don't know how to find you.
[39:49.320 --> 39:50.200]  Go down, I guess.
[39:50.320 --> 39:50.860]  Down, down, down.
[39:55.040 --> 39:55.440]  Okay.
[39:58.660 --> 39:59.500]  Be there in a second.
[40:00.140 --> 40:02.280]  I'm gonna open as soon as we can
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.100]  the shelter that's over here, so we have a spawn point in here.
[40:05.760 --> 40:06.860]  Yeah, I got a beach ball on me.
[40:09.040 --> 40:10.360]  I don't know what's around me, Andrew.
[40:11.580 --> 40:12.460]  Fuck, Gavin.
[40:13.080 --> 40:14.200]  Thanks for taking that hit.
[40:14.680 --> 40:15.960]  I'm opening this up.
[40:16.200 --> 40:16.680]  Get it open!
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.000]  Get it open!
[40:18.620 --> 40:20.580]  No, no, no, no!
[40:20.620 --> 40:21.660]  Trying to de-paper you.
[40:22.760 --> 40:23.480]  Glug, glug, glug.
[40:25.940 --> 40:26.660]  We gluggin'.
[40:27.180 --> 40:28.780]  Okay, we got more stuff we need to repair.
[40:30.240 --> 40:31.740]  We gotta shock it and soak it.
[40:32.400 --> 40:32.580]  Yep.
[40:34.060 --> 40:35.680]  Oh, there's so many upgrade files in here.
[40:37.960 --> 40:39.000]  You make it to us, Geoff?
[40:40.560 --> 40:40.920]  Uh...
[40:42.500 --> 40:43.900]  I'm in the big room.
[40:44.480 --> 40:46.080]  The big room with the big poster?
[40:47.340 --> 40:48.560]  Yeah, I see it.
[40:48.640 --> 40:49.840]  Oh, Pustule, Pustule!
[40:50.780 --> 40:52.020]  Let me get behind him.
[40:53.240 --> 40:53.680]  Fuck.
[40:54.220 --> 40:55.200]  Oh, I see you guys.
[40:56.540 --> 40:56.980]  Ow.
[40:57.620 --> 40:58.460]  Bad out here.
[40:59.280 --> 41:00.060]  Yeah, it's real bad.
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.380]  Okay, Pustule's down.
[41:04.040 --> 41:04.620]  Hey, Geoff.
[41:05.200 --> 41:07.980]  Okay, let's start hitting those repairs
[41:07.980 --> 41:08.800]  as soon as we can.
[41:09.420 --> 41:10.840]  Yeah, sorry, I'm just drinking the tap.
[41:10.840 --> 41:11.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. No problem.
[41:12.460 --> 41:13.200]  You get your health up.
[41:14.940 --> 41:15.260]  Yeah.
[41:17.040 --> 41:18.840]  You might punch me while I'm doing this.
[41:21.020 --> 41:22.120]  Okay, I'm getting the fire.
[41:27.860 --> 41:28.600]  Alright, that one's done.
[41:28.960 --> 41:29.240]  Great shock.
[41:29.380 --> 41:30.520]  Okay, now we just gotta get the one on the right.
[41:30.640 --> 41:32.480]  Be careful, Gavin, that's where Geoff fell.
[41:33.380 --> 41:35.040]  Careful, there is a fall.
[41:37.200 --> 41:37.440]  Got it.
[41:37.580 --> 41:40.200]  Now what do we need to do?
[41:41.220 --> 41:42.140]  Oh, we're shocking him.
[41:42.800 --> 41:43.160]  Yeah.
[41:43.360 --> 41:45.340]  Do we need to do anything additional?
[41:45.620 --> 41:47.360]  Or is that like a...
[41:47.360 --> 41:50.380]  I'm unsure. Let's just do another cycle of it.
[41:50.620 --> 41:52.540]  Okay, I'm gonna go repair that wrench.
[41:53.380 --> 41:54.380]  Yeah, I'm headed towards it.
[41:55.380 --> 41:56.300]  I'll be here in just a moment.
[41:58.980 --> 42:00.000]  Okay, I'm on the one on the right.
[42:02.300 --> 42:03.000]  You got it, Geoff?
[42:03.280 --> 42:03.440]  Yeah.
[42:06.160 --> 42:07.540]  I keep trying to dash.
[42:07.640 --> 42:08.980]  I don't know what game I think I'm playing.
[42:08.980 --> 42:09.660]  Okay.
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.740]  I know, dude, it's so frustrating there isn't a dash.
[42:12.980 --> 42:14.260]  Flip switches, flip switches.
[42:15.760 --> 42:16.680]  Geoff, you got that other one?
[42:17.240 --> 42:17.800]  Yeah, I got it.
[42:19.360 --> 42:20.740]  Oh, I'm getting papered up.
[42:22.700 --> 42:23.180]  Okay, shock.
[42:24.300 --> 42:25.740]  Oh, I'm chunking him with the water.
[42:25.960 --> 42:27.720]  When he's in his electric state, I'm chunking him.
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.260]  I'm throwing shit grenades on him.
[42:32.080 --> 42:33.120]  Nice, nice, nice.
[42:33.180 --> 42:34.580]  Yeah, he's very vulnerable right now.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.100]  Ah, I overheated my gun.
[42:37.100 --> 42:39.620]  Okay, we gotta do that one more time, and I think we can get him.
[42:42.040 --> 42:43.060]  Nice repairs, Gavin.
[42:43.560 --> 42:43.820]  Yep.
[42:45.500 --> 42:47.100]  I'm gonna go for the one on the right again.
[42:47.460 --> 42:48.100]  Or the left, I mean.
[42:49.280 --> 42:51.400]  Jesus Christ. Okay, we got one on the right.
[42:53.080 --> 42:55.480]  I think it's a switch. I can flip it. I'm flipping it.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.380]  Flipping it.
[42:57.100 --> 42:57.860]  Should be shock.
[42:58.360 --> 42:59.160]  Nice, okay.
[43:00.840 --> 43:01.200]  Chunking.
[43:05.740 --> 43:07.200]  Oh, that's rinsing his shit.
[43:08.360 --> 43:09.380]  It's a shit rinser.
[43:09.560 --> 43:10.620]  Gun overheated again.
[43:10.920 --> 43:11.620]  Real shit rinse.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.160]  Oh, we got him!
[43:15.760 --> 43:16.460]  Call the elevator.
[43:20.320 --> 43:21.260]  Okay, let's head back.
[43:21.280 --> 43:22.120]  Good job, well done, boys.
[43:24.740 --> 43:25.700]  I went to the safe room.
[43:27.080 --> 43:28.560]  Yeah, if you wanna come near me, Geoff.
[43:28.740 --> 43:30.620]  You know what, let's group up in the safe room real quick.
[43:30.640 --> 43:31.100]  Let's go in there.
[43:31.920 --> 43:33.360]  I could use some ammo.
[43:35.200 --> 43:36.740]  Use some nades if anyone sees any.
[43:41.860 --> 43:42.860]  A little bit of health.
[43:44.940 --> 43:45.580]  A little sirp.
[43:46.960 --> 43:47.820]  Oh boy.
[43:48.800 --> 43:49.820]  James Davis!
[43:51.600 --> 43:52.240]  Grenades!
[43:52.380 --> 43:53.860]  Bad business over there.
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.280]  Bad business in every direction.
[44:02.710 --> 44:03.930]  Oh god, I'm right in the mouth.
[44:08.660 --> 44:09.940]  Fuck me.
[44:10.400 --> 44:10.980]  Need more ammo.
[44:13.540 --> 44:14.820]  I'm just bullying him.
[44:16.880 --> 44:17.280]  Alright.
[44:18.420 --> 44:19.620]  Bullets, bullets, bullets.
[44:19.980 --> 44:20.980]  Picking up papers.
[44:21.640 --> 44:22.460]  Doing my admin.
[44:23.480 --> 44:23.840]  Nice.
[44:25.860 --> 44:27.560]  Okay, let's start heading back the way we came.
[44:28.300 --> 44:29.240]  Can we repair this?
[44:29.780 --> 44:31.800]  We don't need to. I mean, we can, but we don't have to.
[44:33.120 --> 44:34.100]  Let's just get out of here.
[44:36.160 --> 44:36.340]  Alright.
[44:38.720 --> 44:39.380]  Running back.
[44:39.380 --> 44:40.120]  Uh oh.
[44:42.480 --> 44:42.920]  Woo!
[44:44.340 --> 44:45.320]  I did notice
[44:45.320 --> 44:47.260]  one safe room area
[44:47.260 --> 44:49.380]  that we didn't open. Do we want to open that on the way back?
[44:49.560 --> 44:50.420]  Just to see if there's more.
[44:51.380 --> 44:52.480]  Of course we do.
[44:53.460 --> 44:54.640]  Run across here.
[44:55.060 --> 44:55.960]  Take a left.
[44:57.040 --> 44:57.840]  Where I'm at.
[45:00.960 --> 45:01.840]  Fire's gone.
[45:02.640 --> 45:03.540]  I think it was left.
[45:04.820 --> 45:05.160]  Let's see.
[45:06.860 --> 45:07.600]  Right, yeah.
[45:07.600 --> 45:08.200]  Here we go.
[45:11.400 --> 45:12.340]  Opening shelter.
[45:16.360 --> 45:17.180]  Anything good?
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.420]  Oh yeah, upgrade papers.
[45:19.820 --> 45:20.260]  Above.
[45:25.740 --> 45:28.040]  I wish I was like an inch taller
[45:28.040 --> 45:29.200]  for that one upgrade paper.
[45:29.440 --> 45:30.980]  Oh yeah, people in the safe room.
[45:34.240 --> 45:34.780]  Nice.
[45:35.500 --> 45:36.320]  Got a Jugga coming.
[45:37.700 --> 45:38.240]  Ammo.
[45:38.240 --> 45:39.060]  Grenades.
[45:43.780 --> 45:44.560]  Got him.
[45:44.820 --> 45:45.940]  Now let's push to the elevator.
[45:47.760 --> 45:48.800]  Going straight
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.760]  and then, oh, gotta go left.
[45:50.860 --> 45:52.740]  I guess we gotta go around.
[45:55.560 --> 45:56.460]  Another Jugga.
[45:58.520 --> 45:59.200]  Jugga down.
[46:00.360 --> 46:02.180]  Was he inched already? That was crazy.
[46:02.840 --> 46:05.000]  Uh, yeah, we cooked him.
[46:05.460 --> 46:06.740]  We probably fucked him up the last time.
[46:08.100 --> 46:08.740]  Music playing.
[46:08.740 --> 46:09.580]  This game's cool.
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.280]  These games are great.
[46:13.500 --> 46:14.720]  Remedy always nailed
[46:14.720 --> 46:16.240]  the vibe of whatever they're trying to do.
[46:16.500 --> 46:18.160]  Absolutely. Love Remedy.
[46:19.720 --> 46:20.900]  Okay, elevator started.
[46:23.660 --> 46:24.780]  Let's hold.
[46:25.800 --> 46:26.640]  Oh, here we go.
[46:27.320 --> 46:27.940]  Just hit.
[46:28.500 --> 46:30.360]  I think it'd be fun to be a voice actor
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.960]  for stuff that you can't tell
[46:32.960 --> 46:34.760]  the person, like just the glugging
[46:34.760 --> 46:36.000]  sound when you drink from the tap.
[46:37.120 --> 46:38.000]  It'd be cool to be like,
[46:38.040 --> 46:38.940]  that's my throat.
[46:39.600 --> 46:40.840]  I'm an efforts guy.
[46:42.580 --> 46:43.920]  They call me into grunt
[46:43.920 --> 46:44.480]  and gurgle.
[46:45.920 --> 46:47.840]  I'm like the Troy Baker of drinking water.
[46:53.850 --> 46:54.890]  I was listening to
[46:56.330 --> 46:57.210]  an interview
[46:57.210 --> 46:58.830]  of the guy that does the voice work
[46:58.830 --> 47:00.910]  for Goofy, and I think he was
[47:00.910 --> 47:03.230]  in a movie where he was literally just the glug.
[47:04.070 --> 47:04.510]  Really?
[47:04.830 --> 47:06.770]  He was in a Pixar film or something
[47:06.770 --> 47:08.670]  where he did like the glug or something
[47:08.670 --> 47:11.030]  like that. It's like that was his only role in it.
[47:11.770 --> 47:12.250]  Here we go.
[47:12.570 --> 47:14.530]  Remember, up is go, up is leave.
[47:14.650 --> 47:15.690]  Gavin, get in. Gavin!
[47:16.090 --> 47:16.350]  Gavin!
[47:18.750 --> 47:19.630]  You're refusing.
[47:22.070 --> 47:22.750]  He's being
[47:22.750 --> 47:23.250]  a rabbit.
[47:24.230 --> 47:25.470]  Let's take this guy with us.
[47:26.730 --> 47:27.970]  We got a new best friend.
[47:28.530 --> 47:29.130]  Four-man crew.
[47:31.170 --> 47:32.470]  Oh, hell yeah.
[47:32.470 --> 47:32.670]  Yeah.
[47:35.310 --> 47:36.770]  Oh, good job, guys.
[47:36.850 --> 47:38.510]  On the paper chase. That was another
[47:38.510 --> 47:40.790]  fun episode of FBC Firebreak.
[47:41.210 --> 47:42.770]  I want to play this game more with you guys.
[47:42.830 --> 47:44.070]  I want to see what else is going on here.
[47:44.690 --> 47:46.390]  Well, we got to play
[47:46.390 --> 47:48.090]  again so that we can use all our new research.
[47:48.310 --> 47:50.530]  That's true. I want to use these skill points.
[47:50.650 --> 47:52.670]  I want to get better. How many other levels are there?
[47:52.990 --> 47:54.550]  I don't know. Great question.
[47:56.890 --> 47:58.690]  We'll figure that out along the way, I guess.
[47:59.450 --> 47:59.630]  Yeah.
[47:59.630 --> 48:01.010]  But until then,
[48:01.430 --> 48:03.610]  thank you so much for watching. Make sure to check out our Patreon
[48:04.730 --> 48:05.530]  at TheRegulationPod
[48:05.530 --> 48:07.290]  or Regulatrion.com
[48:07.290 --> 48:09.550]  Do it. Anything you guys want to
[48:10.990 --> 48:11.390]  Anything?
[48:12.050 --> 48:13.190]  Everything Andrew said.
[48:13.470 --> 48:14.770]  Everything I said. Okay.
[48:15.690 --> 48:17.170]  Yeah. Great.
[48:17.750 --> 48:19.090]  Talk to you later.
[48:19.910 --> 48:21.570]  I guess both of you. We're done for the day.
[48:22.050 --> 48:22.350]  I'm assuming.
[48:22.970 --> 48:25.290]  That's weird. I was going to say talk to you later and I realized
[48:25.290 --> 48:27.290]  it's kind of weird to say to the audience. But anyway,
[48:27.290 --> 48:28.550]  we're done. Bye!
[48:29.010 --> 48:29.590]  Bye!
