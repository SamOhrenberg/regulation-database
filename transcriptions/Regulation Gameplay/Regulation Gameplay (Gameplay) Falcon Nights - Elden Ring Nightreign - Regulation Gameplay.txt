[00:00.000 --> 00:02.220]  Hello and welcome to Irregulation Gameplay!
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.640]  We're in Elmer Ring. Night Ring.
[00:05.560 --> 00:07.520]  Have you guys played any of Elden Ring?
[00:07.920 --> 00:08.980]  Yeah, I was bad at it.
[00:09.540 --> 00:10.760]  Yeah, we weren't good at it.
[00:10.880 --> 00:13.580]  I played the first, uh, maybe eight hours of it.
[00:13.980 --> 00:14.380]  Really?
[00:14.980 --> 00:15.880]  I played like two hours.
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.620]  I'm surprised, but that's great.
[00:19.420 --> 00:20.400]  I don't know if it is.
[00:20.900 --> 00:23.240]  I don't know that it's going to help in any way whatsoever in this.
[00:23.400 --> 00:25.460]  Is it different in this? Because I skipped the tutorial.
[00:25.700 --> 00:27.060]  So we can just launch into this.
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.320]  I didn't see that coming.
[00:28.320 --> 00:28.820]  Wow.
[00:28.960 --> 00:32.340]  I was telling Nick, I found a way to get stuck in the tutorial
[00:32.340 --> 00:35.020]  and had to hard reboot the game because I got stuck behind some stairs.
[00:35.220 --> 00:35.920]  Oh no!
[00:36.800 --> 00:37.200]  Exploring.
[00:37.500 --> 00:40.580]  Okay, so let me go to Expeditions.
[00:42.540 --> 00:43.260]  That's a different game.
[00:45.540 --> 00:46.660]  It just says cancel.
[00:47.540 --> 00:49.540]  I think we all have to go to
[00:49.540 --> 00:50.860]  Commence Expedition
[00:50.860 --> 00:51.840]  and then accept it.
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.940]  Oh yeah, okay.
[00:54.140 --> 00:55.640]  Because I just did it and it gave me a checkmark.
[00:56.940 --> 00:58.360]  Oh yeah, we're just waiting on Gizmo.
[00:58.680 --> 01:00.560]  All the tutorial told me, Andrew,
[01:00.640 --> 01:02.180]  is that I am overconfident
[01:02.180 --> 01:04.560]  against little piddly characters
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.480]  and I'm dog shit against bosses.
[01:07.140 --> 01:07.500]  See ya.
[01:08.420 --> 01:10.160]  If you're having trouble finding where to go,
[01:10.260 --> 01:12.140]  Andrew, if you hit back and then you just click
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.280]  on Expeditions from the map.
[01:14.400 --> 01:14.920]  Oh yeah, you can.
[01:15.160 --> 01:16.100]  You'll load it right there.
[01:19.160 --> 01:20.160]  And away we go.
[01:20.420 --> 01:21.460]  Little thing in the top right.
[01:23.800 --> 01:24.520]  For baby Pepsi.
[01:26.780 --> 01:28.200]  Our majestic leader
[01:28.200 --> 01:29.680]  with the flag
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.620]  representing party leader.
[01:32.360 --> 01:33.560]  Matchmaking, here we go.
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.820]  I'm a little bit worried about this.
[01:37.960 --> 01:39.660]  I assume it's not as brutal
[01:39.660 --> 01:42.060]  as base outing ring, but I was not good
[01:42.060 --> 01:42.600]  in multiplayer.
[01:43.620 --> 01:45.540]  I died three times in the tutorial.
[01:46.380 --> 01:46.860]  Oh.
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.280]  Is there a permanence or do you just respawn?
[01:50.060 --> 01:51.180]  You lose a level
[01:51.180 --> 01:53.300]  and you have to go pick up your runes or whatever.
[01:53.300 --> 01:54.360]  Got it.
[01:55.740 --> 01:57.900]  Also, I didn't learn with this character,
[01:58.100 --> 01:59.320]  so this is going to be interesting.
[01:59.540 --> 02:01.700]  Same. Different character than I learned with.
[02:02.980 --> 02:03.720]  You two did
[02:03.720 --> 02:05.400]  the tutorial, then swapped characters.
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.600]  I didn't, but I'm in the default
[02:07.600 --> 02:07.980]  character.
[02:08.480 --> 02:10.100]  Oh, we're birds!
[02:11.380 --> 02:13.340]  Giant falcons, so...
[02:13.340 --> 02:14.000]  Oh, hell yeah!
[02:14.700 --> 02:15.580]  Very regulation.
[02:16.380 --> 02:17.240]  Not mad about this.
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.360]  So, you know, we're cementing this as the regulation
[02:21.360 --> 02:23.700]  Elden Ring crew going forward if we decide
[02:23.700 --> 02:24.660]  to beat this game.
[02:25.420 --> 02:27.760]  How many, what, 60 hours it takes to beat
[02:27.760 --> 02:28.120]  or whatever?
[02:28.820 --> 02:30.620]  I don't even know if this game has an end.
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.680]  How do we start in the air?
[02:34.320 --> 02:35.540]  Where are we dropping?
[02:39.920 --> 02:40.920]  Let's go to Old Town.
[02:43.340 --> 02:44.140]  Back to Verdansk.
[02:46.100 --> 02:47.600]  Dude, I do want to go back to Verdansk.
[02:47.620 --> 02:48.100]  Dude, me too.
[02:48.100 --> 02:50.460]  I was just
[02:50.460 --> 02:52.460]  thinking the other night about how much I would love
[02:52.460 --> 02:54.380]  to go back to the original PUBG map.
[02:55.340 --> 02:56.500]  Oh, dude, I love that
[02:56.500 --> 02:56.800]  map.
[02:58.360 --> 03:00.360]  I'd like to go back to the original Call of Duty
[03:00.360 --> 03:02.480]  one, what was it, it was called Battle
[03:02.480 --> 03:04.340]  or, it was before it was called
[03:04.340 --> 03:04.780]  Warzone.
[03:06.760 --> 03:08.340]  And it was, there was that
[03:08.340 --> 03:10.360]  dam you could go at the top
[03:10.360 --> 03:11.380]  of the map that you could go down.
[03:12.140 --> 03:12.620]  Oh, yeah.
[03:14.280 --> 03:16.520]  That's weaker than what I currently have. I don't need it.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.720]  Swap to that, or a sword.
[03:19.360 --> 03:19.840]  Or a bow.
[03:21.460 --> 03:22.520]  Hey guys, this is a health thing.
[03:23.660 --> 03:24.100]  Okay.
[03:24.540 --> 03:25.240]  Level up.
[03:26.220 --> 03:27.140]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[03:27.780 --> 03:29.320]  Boy, they really simplify leveling up.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.840]  You just hit one button.
[03:32.640 --> 03:33.780]  I will say, it is weird
[03:33.780 --> 03:36.000]  to do a bow and arrow character
[03:36.000 --> 03:36.960]  and not aim.
[03:38.220 --> 03:39.120]  Oh, yeah, that'd be strange.
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.340]  Now, Andrew,
[03:42.540 --> 03:43.420]  you played
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.000]  Elder Ring, you beat it. Is that right?
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.400]  Yep. And then you beat the
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.140]  DLC.
[03:49.780 --> 03:51.320]  DLC as well. So you're
[03:52.920 --> 03:53.880]  very well
[03:53.880 --> 03:55.300]  versed. I've played a lot.
[03:55.540 --> 03:57.740]  I know
[03:58.200 --> 03:59.680]  a shocking little amount.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.860]  Like, I don't remember any of it.
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.680]  Like, you played on mute the whole time?
[04:04.480 --> 04:05.700]  Essentially, yeah.
[04:05.860 --> 04:08.260]  I streamed me beating the DLC boss
[04:08.260 --> 04:10.060]  and then there was like a mechanic I missed
[04:10.060 --> 04:11.760]  that made myself way stronger.
[04:12.120 --> 04:14.340]  So I was able, because of the chat
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.800]  they walked me through, and I was able to beat it once I did that.
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.180]  Oh, that's right.
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.300]  I got a lot of time in this universe,
[04:20.440 --> 04:22.340]  but I don't think I'm a competent player
[04:22.340 --> 04:23.220]  in any way.
[04:24.480 --> 04:26.100]  What if we just run around
[04:26.100 --> 04:28.340]  these little meadows killing
[04:28.340 --> 04:30.700]  entry-level characters and slowly
[04:30.700 --> 04:33.160]  leveling up? Oh, I found a
[04:34.020 --> 04:34.960]  some sort of
[04:34.960 --> 04:36.280]  Summon foe chasing
[04:37.140 --> 04:38.520]  vengeful spirits? That sounds
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.980]  intimidating. Okay!
[04:40.640 --> 04:42.600]  Here we go! Now we're talking.
[04:42.600 --> 04:44.400]  Please, they're on my side, right?
[04:44.580 --> 04:47.320]  A dumb thing! Get him, get him!
[04:49.220 --> 04:49.620]  Yeah!
[04:51.040 --> 04:51.720]  Fuck him up!
[04:53.540 --> 04:54.680]  Oh, there's some dudes over here.
[04:54.740 --> 04:56.120]  A warrior? There's three.
[04:56.380 --> 04:58.980]  One for each of us. Okay, I'm going on the one
[04:58.980 --> 05:00.200]  on the right. I'll go middle.
[05:01.180 --> 05:02.500]  Bad, bad, bad.
[05:04.160 --> 05:04.400]  Oh!
[05:04.580 --> 05:06.300]  I eventually got the one on the right.
[05:07.180 --> 05:08.340]  Going for the middle guy.
[05:09.900 --> 05:10.640]  Nice teamwork!
[05:12.000 --> 05:12.960]  He's quite big.
[05:14.680 --> 05:15.460]  What's going on here?
[05:16.880 --> 05:17.500]  Oh my god!
[05:18.580 --> 05:19.540]  Shit, I forgot!
[05:21.620 --> 05:22.680]  You gotta kill the body.
[05:23.240 --> 05:24.240]  Hit the body once it's down.
[05:26.200 --> 05:26.980]  Alright, nice job.
[05:27.760 --> 05:27.920]  Alright.
[05:28.580 --> 05:30.900]  We didn't get anything for that, I guess.
[05:32.340 --> 05:32.980]  Got some XP.
[05:33.920 --> 05:34.800]  That's a good point.
[05:34.920 --> 05:35.940]  Where are we going?
[05:36.700 --> 05:38.840]  I don't know. I think we just keep going.
[05:39.760 --> 05:40.520]  We should do it.
[05:41.540 --> 05:43.360]  Is there still an active player base
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.520]  on PUBG, by chance?
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.840]  There has to be someone.
[05:47.180 --> 05:48.880]  Heal ailments. Does anyone need to heal?
[05:50.660 --> 05:51.560]  I'm pretty good.
[05:51.660 --> 05:52.980]  You guys can both use a little bit.
[05:53.660 --> 05:55.080]  I think if you just stand
[05:55.080 --> 05:55.900]  in it, it heals everything.
[05:58.440 --> 05:59.200]  Huh, my health died.
[05:59.860 --> 06:01.100]  Yeah, it doesn't seem to be.
[06:01.860 --> 06:03.200]  Oh, maybe it's just heal...
[06:03.700 --> 06:04.080]  buffs.
[06:04.740 --> 06:07.260]  Oh yeah, maybe if you have a poison effect or something.
[06:07.260 --> 06:07.400]  Yeah.
[06:09.140 --> 06:09.860]  Where are we going?
[06:11.320 --> 06:13.620]  I think we're all waiting for the other
[06:13.620 --> 06:15.580]  person to lead. We're all just kind of fake following.
[06:15.900 --> 06:16.880]  Dogs! I got the guy in the back.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.140]  Weird wolf!
[06:19.420 --> 06:19.700]  Thanks.
[06:21.260 --> 06:23.580]  This guy has a... Oh, that was you, Nick.
[06:23.760 --> 06:25.260]  This dog has an arrow for a tail.
[06:25.640 --> 06:27.200]  But I think that was Nick.
[06:27.920 --> 06:28.960]  I may have helped with that.
[06:29.420 --> 06:31.180]  I got a fire pot. Oh, is that a throwable?
[06:31.420 --> 06:33.400]  That's cool. Okay, we share items
[06:33.400 --> 06:35.220]  that we pick up, huh? Oh, that's great.
[06:35.220 --> 06:37.560]  Well, I think it's... I meant more like
[06:37.560 --> 06:39.580]  we can take them from each other.
[06:39.840 --> 06:40.520]  Oh, okay.
[06:41.640 --> 06:43.740]  Diablo style. That is the opposite of sharing
[06:43.740 --> 06:45.540]  items. That is a crazy
[06:45.540 --> 06:47.360]  way to describe that. Yeah, yeah.
[06:47.560 --> 06:49.120]  Well, I was thinking in terms of Diablo.
[06:50.140 --> 06:50.900]  Hey guys? Yeah.
[06:51.820 --> 06:53.480]  Big thing over here on the left.
[06:54.020 --> 06:55.540]  Oh. Do we want that?
[06:55.640 --> 06:57.220]  Yeah, let's get him. Yeah, absolutely.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.660]  Hold on, let me see if I can throw this at him.
[06:59.960 --> 07:01.920]  Oh, shit. Boy, it doesn't give you a lot of...
[07:01.920 --> 07:03.500]  Yeah, okay. I learned that.
[07:04.520 --> 07:06.700]  Get him, get him, get him, get him.
[07:07.980 --> 07:09.520]  Keep hitting, keep hitting, keep hitting, keep hitting.
[07:09.720 --> 07:11.760]  He's got dogs. He's got dogs. He's got dogs. He's got dogs.
[07:11.760 --> 07:12.620]  He's got dogs. He's got dogs.
[07:13.900 --> 07:14.940]  Okay, he's down. He's down.
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.720]  Kill the dogs. Kill the dogs. I doubled my
[07:17.720 --> 07:19.660]  XP in that. That was great. They're eating
[07:19.660 --> 07:20.620]  the dogs.
[07:24.900 --> 07:26.820]  Oh, there's a big, big...
[07:27.720 --> 07:28.360]  Someone's getting hit.
[07:29.180 --> 07:29.540]  Geoff!
[07:31.400 --> 07:32.620]  Why am I here by myself?
[07:32.620 --> 07:34.800]  We're here. We're here, we're here, we're here.
[07:35.600 --> 07:36.900]  It's dead. Don't let the bar
[07:36.900 --> 07:38.100]  fill. Goodness.
[07:41.220 --> 07:43.180]  You should get these rejuvenating.
[07:43.340 --> 07:45.080]  I think you might have death blight.
[07:46.140 --> 07:46.920]  Oh, no. Do I
[07:46.920 --> 07:48.480]  have death blight? Have I been death blighted? Maybe.
[07:48.860 --> 07:50.560]  Where do I get the rejuvenators?
[07:51.640 --> 07:53.020]  We both picked them up.
[07:53.140 --> 07:54.020]  I assumed you were one of them.
[07:54.820 --> 07:56.580]  You good? Is your thing decreasing?
[07:57.040 --> 07:59.040]  Do you have a bar on your screen that's slowly lowering?
[07:59.960 --> 08:00.260]  Nah.
[08:01.120 --> 08:02.580]  Okay, maybe this is your character.
[08:03.040 --> 08:04.720]  Oh, I do. Oh, I do.
[08:04.880 --> 08:06.080]  Yeah. In the middle? Yeah.
[08:06.300 --> 08:07.360]  Yeah, in the middle of your screen.
[08:08.060 --> 08:09.140]  So how the hell do I use this?
[08:10.060 --> 08:11.240]  My bar went away.
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.740]  Oh, here we go. I figured it out.
[08:14.500 --> 08:14.880]  Whoops!
[08:16.600 --> 08:18.080]  Oh, shit. Ow!
[08:18.180 --> 08:19.160]  I poisoned myself!
[08:20.440 --> 08:21.600]  That's not ideal.
[08:22.360 --> 08:23.060]  That was so weak.
[08:23.760 --> 08:26.640]  Oh, what's this fire? What's with all the fire? Why the fire?
[08:26.760 --> 08:27.280]  Oh, why fire?
[08:27.280 --> 08:29.040]  Oh, I died.
[08:29.380 --> 08:29.960]  I died.
[08:33.120 --> 08:33.980]  Oh, I'm near death.
[08:37.940 --> 08:39.760]  Oh, I'm about to die.
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.460]  I don't know!
[08:47.540 --> 08:48.720]  I can't see your screen!
[08:52.140 --> 08:52.740]  I'm back.
[08:52.740 --> 08:54.040]  The flames are chasing me.
[08:54.140 --> 08:56.520]  Oh, I lose. Okay.
[08:56.680 --> 08:57.820]  Yeah, I gotta go get my stuff.
[08:58.980 --> 08:59.440]  Oh, yeah.
[09:02.720 --> 09:03.700]  He's pretty weak.
[09:05.820 --> 09:06.620]  At least he was.
[09:06.720 --> 09:07.660]  Yeah, he's almost dead.
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.100]  Fuck you, dude.
[09:11.200 --> 09:12.600]  He insta-killed me!
[09:12.860 --> 09:13.780]  I'm down again!
[09:14.060 --> 09:14.900]  What do we do about the fire?
[09:15.640 --> 09:16.820]  I don't know what to do, Nick.
[09:16.980 --> 09:19.400]  Is that what kills us?
[09:19.400 --> 09:19.960]  Let's get above it.
[09:20.600 --> 09:22.660]  Oh, I'm gonna lose all my stuff!
[09:24.120 --> 09:24.840]  Come on, Jack!
[09:24.960 --> 09:25.860]  I'm in it!
[09:25.980 --> 09:30.580]  I made it through.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.460]  Am I on fire? Am I dying?
[09:32.900 --> 09:35.380]  Oh, I'm burning! I'm burning horribly!
[09:37.220 --> 09:37.940]  I'm dead!
[09:39.920 --> 09:40.420]  Okay.
[09:41.460 --> 09:42.460]  I'm getting you guys.
[09:43.020 --> 09:43.520]  I'm trying.
[09:43.960 --> 09:45.920]  I'm trying!
[09:46.740 --> 09:47.980]  You're so far!
[09:50.380 --> 09:51.260]  Let me go!
[09:51.680 --> 09:52.520]  No, you're dead.
[09:54.180 --> 09:54.560]  I...
[09:56.340 --> 09:58.160]  I'm completely overwhelmed with
[09:58.160 --> 09:59.900]  whatever that was.
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.020]  Maybe it's the circle?
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.740]  It seemed like things were going great.
[10:04.980 --> 10:05.160]  Yeah.
[10:05.420 --> 10:07.800]  It really did. I think it's almost like the circle.
[10:08.380 --> 10:09.700]  Because it's a long line.
[10:10.980 --> 10:12.060]  I think we gotta start moving
[10:12.060 --> 10:12.720]  into the world.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.120]  Okay, well, I have to go get
[10:15.120 --> 10:15.800]  my body.
[10:16.280 --> 10:18.920]  I think that's why I instantly
[10:18.920 --> 10:20.420]  died. I think I ran through it.
[10:21.060 --> 10:22.660]  Yeah, the fire, I think, killed you.
[10:23.500 --> 10:24.440]  Let's look at the map.
[10:24.840 --> 10:27.080]  Oh no! Oh no! I found a boss!
[10:27.280 --> 10:28.960]  I found a boss! I'm getting out!
[10:29.240 --> 10:30.040]  I'm getting out!
[10:30.260 --> 10:32.680]  I can't get to the other side.
[10:32.740 --> 10:33.600]  I'm going to you guys!
[10:34.500 --> 10:35.460]  I'm just coming to you.
[10:35.740 --> 10:39.040]  If you look back on your map, you can see that we can't
[10:39.040 --> 10:39.920]  go that way, I don't think.
[10:39.920 --> 10:41.680]  Yeah, it's outside.
[10:41.900 --> 10:44.660]  If you look back, it's like a battle royale
[10:44.660 --> 10:45.300]  circle.
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.260]  That's where my body was.
[10:49.220 --> 10:50.380]  We don't need bodies.
[10:51.340 --> 10:51.680]  What's this?
[10:53.060 --> 10:54.240]  I guess we don't.
[10:54.940 --> 10:56.220]  I ran away from...
[10:56.220 --> 10:57.920]  Should we take the fight to
[10:57.920 --> 10:58.440]  bossman?
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.400]  Oh, dragon!
[11:01.680 --> 11:03.420]  To the right, we got little dragon guys.
[11:03.920 --> 11:05.420]  Or bats, I guess.
[11:05.520 --> 11:06.660]  Are you guys level one again?
[11:06.660 --> 11:07.360]  Sure am!
[11:13.240 --> 11:15.200]  We got to get some kills going.
[11:15.300 --> 11:16.160]  We got to get that XP.
[11:18.980 --> 11:19.940]  Oh, Jesus!
[11:20.320 --> 11:21.540]  Oh my God!
[11:22.440 --> 11:23.520]  I need a revive!
[11:24.580 --> 11:25.380]  I'm hitting the shit out of you.
[11:25.880 --> 11:27.040]  That's not helping!
[11:27.500 --> 11:28.880]  Yes it is!
[11:30.560 --> 11:31.660]  That's how you pick up?
[11:31.780 --> 11:32.040]  Okay!
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.540]  Beat the shit out of me!
[11:35.540 --> 11:36.800]  Oh God!
[11:37.500 --> 11:39.760]  That was the misbegotten guy
[11:39.760 --> 11:40.820]  I was telling you about!
[11:41.720 --> 11:42.740]  This is brutal!
[11:43.400 --> 11:45.720]  So you just beat each other up to revive?
[11:46.340 --> 11:46.600]  Yeah.
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.660]  You do it until you
[11:49.660 --> 11:51.940]  knock all the purple health bars down and then you revive.
[11:52.400 --> 11:53.400]  Got it. Okay.
[11:54.200 --> 11:55.740]  Alright, so that was like a mission wipe
[11:55.740 --> 11:56.080]  then?
[11:58.280 --> 11:59.040]  Let's see.
[11:59.740 --> 12:00.880]  No, we're still in it.
[12:01.080 --> 12:03.360]  What the fuck are we doing here?
[12:04.400 --> 12:05.580]  I gotta go get my
[12:06.440 --> 12:06.920]  lives.
[12:07.420 --> 12:09.340]  I had 800 lives!
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.980]  Or points, or whatever. XP.
[12:12.620 --> 12:14.180]  Why is my health bar so small?
[12:15.200 --> 12:15.820]  Oh yeah, I had
[12:15.820 --> 12:16.300]  2,400.
[12:18.520 --> 12:19.900]  I also had 2,400.
[12:20.600 --> 12:20.960]  We gotta
[12:21.580 --> 12:23.520]  get to an upgrade station.
[12:24.360 --> 12:24.600]  Yeah.
[12:25.040 --> 12:26.800]  This level 1 life is not for me.
[12:28.040 --> 12:28.260]  Oh!
[12:29.680 --> 12:30.780]  Level 1 ain't it.
[12:31.700 --> 12:32.740]  Get him, get him, get him!
[12:32.980 --> 12:34.060]  Nice. Nice job.
[12:34.380 --> 12:35.500]  Oh, gotta hit him again.
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.980]  I wonder if we could fucking fumble through the game
[12:38.980 --> 12:41.120]  and just always end up as level 1.
[12:41.640 --> 12:41.980]  You know?
[12:42.460 --> 12:44.820]  But just keep throwing our level 1 bodies
[12:44.820 --> 12:47.080]  at the world until eventually we just
[12:47.080 --> 12:48.380]  hammer our way through it.
[12:49.000 --> 12:49.620]  Up here?
[12:51.260 --> 12:53.000]  I could be completely wrong, but I think
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.640]  this is sort of like an extraction game.
[12:55.020 --> 12:56.620]  If you go... Oh, okay.
[12:56.760 --> 12:57.460]  Like, cumulative.
[13:00.780 --> 13:01.180]  Okay.
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.680]  We're getting nice and high up here.
[13:04.360 --> 13:06.760]  I'm a little scared because this kind of looks like the environment.
[13:07.140 --> 13:08.700]  Oh, ghosts. We got ghosts.
[13:09.100 --> 13:09.920]  Jellyfish ghosts.
[13:10.920 --> 13:11.320]  Great.
[13:12.580 --> 13:13.860]  We're so far from the ocean.
[13:14.780 --> 13:17.080]  I ain't scared of you. Okay, you went red. I'm scared of you.
[13:17.220 --> 13:18.300]  I'm scared of you. They went red.
[13:18.580 --> 13:20.720]  Oh, we got a boss! Ancient Hero Samur!
[13:22.460 --> 13:22.860]  This...
[13:22.860 --> 13:24.900]  An ancient hero doesn't sound like a task
[13:24.900 --> 13:25.660]  for a level 1.
[13:28.600 --> 13:30.260]  Just cause he's old doesn't mean...
[13:30.260 --> 13:31.700]  Oh, no, he's good. He's real good.
[13:31.780 --> 13:32.940]  Oh, Geoff's down.
[13:33.580 --> 13:35.200]  I'm running. I saw it happen.
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.320]  I'm getting out of here.
[13:36.500 --> 13:37.420]  I'm sorry, Geoff.
[13:38.020 --> 13:39.360]  It's okay. You gotta come get me.
[13:39.780 --> 13:40.900]  He's distracted by Nick.
[13:41.880 --> 13:42.600]  I'm going back.
[13:44.460 --> 13:45.940]  Smack me hard. I'm on my way.
[13:46.460 --> 13:48.320]  Nick, you son of a bitch. You're gonna start hitting me soon.
[13:48.940 --> 13:49.980]  I'm hitting. I'm hitting. I'm hitting.
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.460]  Oh, dude. You gotta keep going.
[13:52.520 --> 13:54.300]  Hit me harder. Right trigger, too.
[13:54.300 --> 13:56.080]  They both hit me.
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.420]  Ow, that hurt. That's good. That's the kind of pain I need.
[13:58.900 --> 13:59.800]  That's what I'm looking for.
[13:59.880 --> 14:00.740]  It hurts good.
[14:02.500 --> 14:03.380]  He's coming for you!
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.440]  You should've killed that.
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.020]  I'm almost up.
[14:11.080 --> 14:12.380]  Oh, he's coming back for me.
[14:12.600 --> 14:13.840]  I'm getting him. I'm getting him.
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.000]  Geoff, get Geoff.
[14:15.840 --> 14:17.180]  You're not gonna get me.
[14:18.480 --> 14:20.420]  How the fuck am I supposed to get you up?
[14:20.960 --> 14:22.060]  Go, Nick. Watch out. Watch out.
[14:22.060 --> 14:22.640]  I'm down.
[14:23.500 --> 14:24.500]  Oh, fuck.
[14:25.160 --> 14:26.480]  How the hell am I supposed to get you up?
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.800]  It's hard. Well, it gets harder the more you die.
[14:31.420 --> 14:33.620]  The first time you go down, you only have one more.
[14:33.620 --> 14:34.060]  I got 1% health.
[14:34.180 --> 14:35.080]  I'm sorry.
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.960]  Run. Don't forget X to use your potion.
[14:40.440 --> 14:42.920]  Oh, the map is closing in.
[14:45.120 --> 14:45.700]  Oh, shit.
[14:47.660 --> 14:49.100]  This fucking game.
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.880]  You know, we're figuring out our bearings on this first one.
[14:52.900 --> 14:53.860]  Oh, the circle's closing.
[14:56.380 --> 14:57.400]  Ah! It's coming!
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.300]  I'm dead. I came back.
[15:00.560 --> 15:01.460]  I'm just trying to find you.
[15:01.580 --> 15:05.380]  Let me level before...
[15:06.200 --> 15:07.580]  Fuck! Shit.
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.560]  I don't know if I even dropped this far without dying.
[15:12.540 --> 15:12.980]  Okay.
[15:13.540 --> 15:14.540]  Oh, Christ, guys.
[15:15.260 --> 15:17.640]  Oh, no, Geoff. That looks bad.
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.240]  Oh, I instantly died.
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.260]  I'm down instantly.
[15:21.640 --> 15:23.320]  Oh, you guys are coming up on my butthole, though.
[15:23.400 --> 15:24.000]  Come save me.
[15:25.200 --> 15:26.620]  I'm getting the guy first.
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.620]  Oh, there's several of them.
[15:30.280 --> 15:30.840]  Yeah, there's three.
[15:31.440 --> 15:34.040]  Believe me, if it was one, you wouldn't have stood a chance.
[15:34.740 --> 15:36.180]  How are you...
[15:36.180 --> 15:37.480]  He died so quick.
[15:38.140 --> 15:39.980]  Yeah, it gets harder the more you die.
[15:40.120 --> 15:41.220]  You die the faster you die.
[15:42.640 --> 15:43.780]  Death begets death.
[15:45.420 --> 15:46.440]  Circle's still closing.
[15:47.120 --> 15:49.780]  Does anybody know how to use the...
[15:49.780 --> 15:50.980]  Like, what the blue...
[15:50.980 --> 15:53.740]  What the two circles are at the bottom center of your screen?
[15:54.160 --> 15:54.960]  Powers or whatever?
[15:55.220 --> 15:55.760]  I'm not sure.
[15:56.620 --> 15:58.020]  I'm not sure.
[16:00.420 --> 16:01.320]  No, stop drinking.
[16:02.700 --> 16:03.600]  Oh, I have this already.
[16:07.650 --> 16:08.030]  Oh, guys.
[16:08.250 --> 16:08.850]  Guys, we got a guy.
[16:09.850 --> 16:11.310]  He's a bitch. He's dead.
[16:11.830 --> 16:12.250]  Great job.
[16:12.510 --> 16:12.930]  Another one.
[16:12.930 --> 16:13.870]  Oh, shit.
[16:14.170 --> 16:15.250]  Wall closing.
[16:17.010 --> 16:18.410]  How do we go?
[16:18.610 --> 16:19.990]  How do we get...
[16:20.890 --> 16:22.190]  Oh, God. The wall.
[16:22.490 --> 16:23.410]  I can't make it up.
[16:24.350 --> 16:25.490]  I'm dead.
[16:26.410 --> 16:27.150]  We're so fucked.
[16:28.910 --> 16:30.390]  We're closing in on that tree.
[16:31.730 --> 16:33.350]  I think I might abandon the archer.
[16:35.170 --> 16:36.290]  It seems tough.
[16:37.350 --> 16:37.950]  Okay.
[16:38.730 --> 16:40.090]  That was our first day.
[16:40.090 --> 16:40.750]  Okay.
[16:42.150 --> 16:43.470]  How did we do?
[16:44.090 --> 16:45.150]  We killed 35 enemies.
[16:46.070 --> 16:50.050]  Well, we killed 35 enemies.
[16:50.250 --> 16:51.310]  That seems pretty cool.
[16:51.730 --> 16:52.730]  Yeah, okay.
[16:53.110 --> 16:55.670]  Let's see what the game thought of it.
[16:56.430 --> 16:58.130]  Conduct a relic rite to evoke
[16:58.130 --> 16:59.650]  the power of an obtained relic.
[16:59.710 --> 17:00.430]  We can do that.
[17:02.090 --> 17:03.970]  Conduct a relic rite to evoke the power
[17:03.970 --> 17:05.250]  of an obtained relic.
[17:06.050 --> 17:07.490]  Relics used in rites are not consumed
[17:07.490 --> 17:10.110]  and can be repeatedly used in later relic rites.
[17:11.890 --> 17:13.450]  Magic grease in possession.
[17:13.630 --> 17:14.990]  What the fuck is magic grease?
[17:15.030 --> 17:16.550]  You got some magic grease?
[17:16.970 --> 17:18.050]  You know what? I'm going to use it.
[17:18.410 --> 17:20.430]  You and I, Geoff, let's start a burger joint.
[17:20.510 --> 17:22.170]  Let's get that magic grease going.
[17:22.450 --> 17:24.390]  Oh, you can't go magic grease without me.
[17:25.110 --> 17:27.290]  Of course. We need a condiment expert.
[17:27.730 --> 17:29.150]  Have I done it? Is that it?
[17:29.270 --> 17:29.930]  Did I do it?
[17:30.810 --> 17:31.410]  Did I do it?
[17:31.610 --> 17:34.970]  As long as slot one has a thing in it now.
[17:34.970 --> 17:36.950]  I mean, it just...
[17:36.950 --> 17:37.650]  Relics.
[17:38.610 --> 17:40.750]  Add. Remove. Favorites.
[17:41.410 --> 17:43.170]  Okay. Close. Remove. Detailed view.
[17:43.330 --> 17:45.270]  Save as preset. Detailed view.
[17:45.950 --> 17:46.470]  Slot one.
[17:47.490 --> 17:49.710]  Does it look like you added to it?
[17:49.990 --> 17:50.190]  Yep.
[17:50.730 --> 17:52.210]  You get an achievement once you did it.
[17:52.910 --> 17:53.710]  What's the achievement?
[17:54.570 --> 17:56.490]  Invoke the power of a relic for the first time.
[17:56.890 --> 17:58.710]  Well, shit. Do we...
[17:58.710 --> 18:00.790]  Yeah, we gotta launch into a new expedition.
[18:01.210 --> 18:02.550]  I feel like...
[18:02.550 --> 18:04.010]  I'm a little bit better of an understanding.
[18:04.170 --> 18:05.350]  We can't run through the fire.
[18:05.790 --> 18:08.010]  I feel like that was really our downfall.
[18:08.130 --> 18:09.410]  And we never recovered from it.
[18:09.690 --> 18:09.710]  No.
[18:10.090 --> 18:13.650]  That was the beginning of the end.
[18:13.790 --> 18:14.990]  And we never came back.
[18:16.250 --> 18:17.850]  Everybody's just waiting on Nick.
[18:17.890 --> 18:18.130]  Sorry.
[18:18.870 --> 18:20.630]  I forgot that we were still in the same group.
[18:22.330 --> 18:24.150]  Wait on Nick.
[18:24.210 --> 18:24.690]  Yeah.
[18:25.930 --> 18:27.430]  Wait on Nick.
[18:27.830 --> 18:28.190]  Tonight.
[18:28.190 --> 18:28.690]  Tonight.
[18:30.190 --> 18:32.150]  Nick's taking time. Alright.
[18:36.430 --> 18:38.790]  Are we all just gonna be the first guy?
[18:39.030 --> 18:39.470]  I'm gonna be.
[18:40.530 --> 18:40.990]  Triplets!
[18:42.010 --> 18:44.030]  I think we are. I think fuck being the different.
[18:46.630 --> 18:48.290]  Oh, we got a little cutscene this time.
[18:48.910 --> 18:50.370]  We had one last time, didn't we?
[18:50.910 --> 18:51.430]  Oh, yeah.
[18:51.870 --> 18:52.330]  Who cares?
[18:55.070 --> 18:56.620]  How quickly you went from...
[18:56.620 --> 18:58.280]  I don't give a fuck.
[18:58.320 --> 18:59.460]  Oh, you can skip this, apparently.
[18:59.980 --> 19:02.260]  Why would I want to skip hopping on a falcon?
[19:02.840 --> 19:03.760]  I want to get to dying.
[19:05.560 --> 19:06.740]  This is the only time
[19:06.740 --> 19:08.540]  we look cool during this whole process.
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.120]  I'm going to enjoy it.
[19:11.180 --> 19:12.400]  That's the next little point.
[19:13.980 --> 19:16.080]  I really like the loading animation
[19:16.080 --> 19:18.440]  of the slowly flopping wings.
[19:19.100 --> 19:19.620]  Flapping?
[19:20.040 --> 19:21.120]  Flopping wings.
[19:21.620 --> 19:24.480]  So are we playing
[19:25.100 --> 19:26.420]  a battle royale game?
[19:26.560 --> 19:27.280]  Is that what's going on here?
[19:27.420 --> 19:28.620]  Are there other people in this world?
[19:30.060 --> 19:31.420]  Where are we landing? Let's go here.
[19:31.540 --> 19:34.340]  I think it all closes in on the tree.
[19:34.620 --> 19:36.600]  And I bet you there's a big boss fight at the tree.
[19:36.720 --> 19:38.160]  We just never reached it.
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.300]  Anybody got enough to level?
[19:41.400 --> 19:42.520]  No, we just started.
[19:42.800 --> 19:43.820]  Oh, I'm good, guys.
[19:44.760 --> 19:46.240]  When I kill them, do you guys get...
[19:46.240 --> 19:47.420]  Did you just get plus 640?
[19:47.800 --> 19:48.080]  Yeah.
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.220]  XP from killing things is shared.
[19:51.220 --> 19:52.360]  That's great.
[19:53.880 --> 19:54.320]  Alright.
[19:56.560 --> 19:58.660]  Let's try to hit level 3 this time.
[19:58.740 --> 19:59.460]  Let's be ambitious.
[19:59.760 --> 20:00.980]  Dude, let's try to hit level 2.
[20:02.300 --> 20:03.660]  Let's try to keep level 2.
[20:05.220 --> 20:05.940]  Oh, God!
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.800]  Guys, I'm getting railed here!
[20:08.460 --> 20:09.280]  What are you fighting?
[20:09.800 --> 20:10.360]  Where are you?
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.480]  I'm right at the beginning.
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.140]  I'm right at the beginning.
[20:16.740 --> 20:17.560]  Hold on, Geoff.
[20:18.660 --> 20:19.320]  We're coming!
[20:20.020 --> 20:20.720]  Where is it?
[20:20.840 --> 20:22.020]  I heard like a bird or something.
[20:22.060 --> 20:22.960]  I'm running from a bird.
[20:25.040 --> 20:26.280]  Oh, they're everywhere.
[20:27.800 --> 20:28.240]  Alright.
[20:28.660 --> 20:29.360]  Oh, Nick!
[20:31.540 --> 20:32.720]  Do I do good?
[20:33.920 --> 20:34.300]  Oh, yeah.
[20:34.380 --> 20:37.180]  It looked like it was a killing enemy health bar.
[20:37.300 --> 20:40.340]  It looked like your health bar went to zero on my screen.
[20:41.600 --> 20:41.860]  Yeah!
[20:44.940 --> 20:45.380]  Excellent.
[20:46.980 --> 20:47.420]  Oh!
[20:47.980 --> 20:48.420]  No!
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.960]  How much XP is needed for this?
[20:50.060 --> 20:50.760]  7,000?
[20:50.880 --> 20:53.900]  I keep forgetting what button is what.
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.580]  There's more stuff over here.
[20:58.600 --> 20:59.040]  Nice!
[20:59.860 --> 21:01.080]  What's in these crates?
[21:02.540 --> 21:03.460]  There are a lot of items.
[21:03.640 --> 21:04.260]  Raise defenses.
[21:04.280 --> 21:05.040]  All kinds of stuff.
[21:07.320 --> 21:08.060]  Where's the circle?
[21:09.500 --> 21:11.540]  We're pretty good at it right now.
[21:11.800 --> 21:13.020]  You can definitely get to level 2.
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.940]  What's up, you level 1s?
[21:15.760 --> 21:16.260]  I'm level 2.
[21:17.700 --> 21:18.220]  Look at this.
[21:19.260 --> 21:20.240]  Alright, where should we go?
[21:20.580 --> 21:22.040]  Probably toward the middle, I guess.
[21:22.320 --> 21:22.520]  Okay.
[21:24.560 --> 21:25.440]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[21:27.200 --> 21:29.280]  Maybe, like, keep the yellow thing.
[21:29.620 --> 21:31.020]  They show up on the map.
[21:31.140 --> 21:34.460]  Maybe keep them in our minds so we can stay close to a place where we can level and heal.
[21:34.580 --> 21:35.800]  Heal ailments here.
[21:36.960 --> 21:37.520]  Oh, I got guys.
[21:39.480 --> 21:40.120]  Where are you?
[21:40.120 --> 21:40.920]  I'm coming for you.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.780]  Oh, Jesus!
[21:44.140 --> 21:45.640]  Fuck that guy.
[21:48.120 --> 21:48.880]  Chunked me.
[21:51.600 --> 21:53.920]  Ooh, we got some castle action over here.
[21:54.260 --> 21:55.280]  Oh, we got castle action?
[21:55.480 --> 21:56.780]  Well, maybe it's a church.
[21:57.220 --> 21:59.380]  Anybody want a beast lure pot?
[22:00.000 --> 22:00.580]  I'm good.
[22:01.040 --> 22:03.440]  I don't think I want to lure any beasts.
[22:03.440 --> 22:04.020]  There's a fire pot.
[22:08.160 --> 22:09.560]  I'm sick of these guys.
[22:09.660 --> 22:09.800]  Okay.
[22:11.080 --> 22:11.820]  Should we check it out?
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.500]  Uh, sure.
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.960]  I think I see things in the church.
[22:18.680 --> 22:19.720]  X to heal, right?
[22:19.980 --> 22:20.400]  Oh, wolves!
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.300]  Oh shit, I didn't even see them.
[22:23.780 --> 22:24.580]  There's potions?
[22:25.680 --> 22:27.100]  I think you can heal with X.
[22:27.760 --> 22:28.980]  What the hell are those things?
[22:29.140 --> 22:29.760]  I don't know.
[22:29.760 --> 22:30.980]  Oh, these things.
[22:31.100 --> 22:32.620]  Oh, you've engaged!
[22:33.740 --> 22:35.560]  I assume that's why we were here.
[22:35.860 --> 22:37.060]  Oh, goodness.
[22:38.500 --> 22:39.980]  It's a boss, it's a boss.
[22:40.160 --> 22:41.000]  Yeah, it sure is.
[22:43.740 --> 22:45.640]  This whole gate, it's all bosses.
[22:47.660 --> 22:49.140]  It's almost dead, it's almost dead.
[22:49.420 --> 22:49.680]  Yeah!
[22:50.440 --> 22:53.760]  Oh, we can hit level 3 now.
[22:54.380 --> 22:55.120]  Enemy fell.
[22:56.320 --> 22:57.660]  Oh, we can level up here.
[22:58.980 --> 23:00.640]  Hell yeah, I can almost hit level 4.
[23:00.940 --> 23:02.120]  No one can, nevermind.
[23:02.760 --> 23:04.220]  It didn't subtract the XP.
[23:04.620 --> 23:05.840]  Level 3, fellers!
[23:06.600 --> 23:08.300]  Oh, I've never felt so strong!
[23:08.680 --> 23:09.760]  I got a new sword, too.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.080]  Oh, nice!
[23:12.180 --> 23:15.720]  I can't stop being silver, which is cool, but it makes me walk slow.
[23:15.900 --> 23:16.720]  Is that a...
[23:16.720 --> 23:17.740]  No, we got a real wolf.
[23:17.820 --> 23:19.180]  I thought it was a statue for a second.
[23:19.280 --> 23:20.420]  We got a wolf over here, I'm getting him.
[23:21.200 --> 23:22.500]  Oh, wow, he did look like a statue.
[23:22.900 --> 23:23.880]  Oh, there's several wolves!
[23:23.880 --> 23:26.320]  Oh, they're little babies with him.
[23:27.400 --> 23:28.460]  Get them all!
[23:29.830 --> 23:30.660]  Gotta get them all.
[23:32.720 --> 23:35.960]  The motto of every wolf-killing organization.
[23:36.580 --> 23:36.840]  Yeah.
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.760]  Also, Pokemon.
[23:39.460 --> 23:42.760]  The only good wolf's a dead wolf, just like the Pokemon, they say.
[23:42.920 --> 23:44.820]  That's what Liam Neeson is always saying.
[23:45.420 --> 23:46.060]  About Pokemon?
[23:46.820 --> 23:47.820]  Yes, it's very weird.
[23:47.820 --> 23:49.580]  That guy fucking hates Pokemon.
[23:50.020 --> 23:53.580]  He strangely loves wolves, but cannot stand Pokemon.
[23:53.580 --> 23:55.840]  Not based on the movie I saw.
[24:00.400 --> 24:02.820]  We need to move.
[24:03.800 --> 24:04.880]  Hates wolves and taken?
[24:05.760 --> 24:07.720]  Yeah, it's a subtle undercurrent of the film.
[24:09.340 --> 24:11.780]  Love actually, except for wolves.
[24:13.560 --> 24:14.360]  Look at this guy.
[24:17.060 --> 24:19.620]  Oh, they're gargoyles!
[24:20.080 --> 24:22.140]  Yeah, I called them dragons.
[24:22.140 --> 24:24.400]  They're definitely more gargoyle-y bats.
[24:24.600 --> 24:25.320]  Definitely not dragons.
[24:25.500 --> 24:27.680]  No, I just saw wings and I got excited.
[24:29.440 --> 24:31.600]  I got an astrologer's stamp here.
[24:31.760 --> 24:31.860]  Damn.
[24:32.840 --> 24:33.280]  Oh, nice.
[24:34.500 --> 24:36.000]  If anybody wants to watch me take it.
[24:36.520 --> 24:38.160]  What's the current moon situation?
[24:38.600 --> 24:40.040]  Is it rising or whatever?
[24:40.560 --> 24:41.840]  It's waning right now.
[24:41.980 --> 24:42.640]  Look at this asshole!
[24:44.160 --> 24:46.480]  Oh, there's a lot of damage going on over there.
[24:46.540 --> 24:48.840]  That's not from us, which makes me a little nervous.
[24:49.920 --> 24:52.260]  We both ran right past that guy.
[24:52.500 --> 24:53.080]  Yeah, we did.
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.300]  Maybe they're fighting each other.
[24:54.380 --> 24:55.060]  They're taking each other out.
[24:55.240 --> 24:55.600]  Ow!
[24:57.480 --> 24:57.840]  Damn.
[24:59.920 --> 25:02.600]  We're near a boss who has damage, so I think you're right.
[25:03.400 --> 25:05.080]  Oh, Andrew, you were right. X is heal.
[25:05.580 --> 25:05.740]  Yeah.
[25:06.380 --> 25:07.920]  Wish I'd have known that the whole last round.
[25:08.220 --> 25:11.180]  I wish they'd have taught me that in the tutorial.
[25:13.100 --> 25:14.560]  This is where I got lost.
[25:14.800 --> 25:15.980]  This is where I got stuck in the map.
[25:15.980 --> 25:17.920]  Oh, no!
[25:18.420 --> 25:19.400]  That's bad.
[25:20.060 --> 25:21.960]  Okay, Nick's going in. Run away!
[25:22.500 --> 25:23.020]  He's gonna swing!
[25:23.760 --> 25:26.180]  Yeah, I'm committed to the swings.
[25:28.140 --> 25:28.520]  Ah!
[25:33.740 --> 25:35.200]  He ate me!
[25:35.500 --> 25:36.320]  Oh, he ate you?
[25:38.320 --> 25:38.840]  Hit him!
[25:38.880 --> 25:40.460]  I got him! He's dead!
[25:42.780 --> 25:44.620]  Yes, we did it!
[25:44.840 --> 25:45.900]  Oh, I'm getting hit!
[25:47.200 --> 25:48.080]  You're fine.
[25:49.940 --> 25:50.500]  What's this?
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.620]  I watched the whole thing happen.
[25:52.620 --> 25:53.960]  Oh, there's items y'all can get from that.
[25:56.400 --> 25:57.960]  I got a better sword, I think.
[25:59.020 --> 25:59.380]  Yeah.
[25:59.940 --> 26:01.800]  I just leveled up to level 5, baby.
[26:03.440 --> 26:03.920]  Nice.
[26:05.740 --> 26:06.320]  I'm level 4.
[26:06.500 --> 26:07.400]  I can't afford 5.
[26:08.060 --> 26:10.000]  Yeah, same. Too rich for my blood.
[26:12.320 --> 26:13.240]  Ow! Arrows!
[26:13.240 --> 26:14.460]  Who the fuck?
[26:14.800 --> 26:16.120]  Who did that?
[26:17.080 --> 26:18.480]  Up here, I got him.
[26:18.880 --> 26:19.780]  Thanks, Nick.
[26:20.880 --> 26:21.840]  Another one!
[26:23.100 --> 26:24.900]  Didn't mean to use my healing.
[26:26.000 --> 26:26.660]  Sure is.
[26:26.820 --> 26:27.720]  I leveled up to 5.
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.880]  Hey, check this out.
[26:31.120 --> 26:31.360]  Andrew.
[26:32.520 --> 26:33.560]  Where you at?
[26:34.820 --> 26:36.020]  Let's kill these guys first.
[26:37.980 --> 26:38.460]  Nick!
[26:38.820 --> 26:40.260]  I didn't realize there was a dude.
[26:40.260 --> 26:41.520]  I thought it was you guys.
[26:43.800 --> 26:44.860]  We got him.
[26:45.160 --> 26:46.640]  I found the chest room.
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.000]  There's a chest room?
[26:49.260 --> 26:51.500]  I'm gonna open one and save the other two for y'all.
[26:51.840 --> 26:52.780]  I'll go middle, I guess.
[26:55.340 --> 26:56.840]  Twin knight swords.
[26:57.320 --> 26:57.880]  I don't think I will.
[26:57.900 --> 26:58.920]  Boiled prawn.
[26:59.200 --> 27:02.040]  Do you guys want twin knight swords?
[27:03.240 --> 27:03.980]  No, thanks.
[27:04.600 --> 27:06.140]  If you guys come over here,
[27:07.020 --> 27:08.600]  and then you can
[27:08.600 --> 27:11.360]  you can clamber up here and fall through that hole.
[27:12.100 --> 27:12.620]  Oh, no thanks.
[27:12.640 --> 27:14.360]  And then you cannot get back out.
[27:14.740 --> 27:15.120]  I'm good.
[27:16.500 --> 27:17.480]  Shall we go up?
[27:20.780 --> 27:21.540]  What was that?
[27:22.680 --> 27:25.100]  I was just busting up some crates.
[27:25.300 --> 27:25.560]  Okay.
[27:26.620 --> 27:28.740]  Crate, the natural enemy of all video game players.
[27:29.000 --> 27:29.400]  Fair point.
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.400]  Liam Neeson also hates crates.
[27:33.480 --> 27:34.300]  Add it to his list.
[27:34.480 --> 27:36.280]  Oh, those are people.
[27:37.120 --> 27:37.560]  Ow!
[27:38.780 --> 27:39.220]  Ow.
[27:39.780 --> 27:40.860]  He definitely was.
[27:41.660 --> 27:42.980]  Yeah, that guy's got his dicks.
[27:44.180 --> 27:46.020]  This is where you get your ass kicked
[27:46.020 --> 27:48.740]  by the boss in the fucking tutorial.
[27:48.980 --> 27:50.160]  Oh, what is that? Oh, what is this thing?
[27:50.820 --> 27:51.520]  What's this fella?
[27:52.240 --> 27:54.720]  Oh, he dropped shit. Oh, an iron shield.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.180]  Dropping off the...
[27:57.180 --> 27:57.640]  bat?
[27:59.280 --> 28:00.700]  Yeah, I'm gonna drop off the bat.
[28:01.520 --> 28:02.400]  Alright, are you jumping?
[28:02.720 --> 28:03.540]  I'm jumping!
[28:04.160 --> 28:05.180]  We're going in.
[28:05.580 --> 28:06.020]  Ow.
[28:07.500 --> 28:08.360]  What is that?
[28:09.540 --> 28:10.800]  The sky's purple.
[28:11.880 --> 28:13.780]  Where? Oh, it's probably us beating the game.
[28:14.240 --> 28:16.120]  Oh, what is this awful thing?
[28:18.520 --> 28:19.840]  Oh, a person. Skeleton man.
[28:20.460 --> 28:21.820]  That doesn't look like beating the game.
[28:22.700 --> 28:23.720]  Do we need to keep hitting the corpse?
[28:24.720 --> 28:26.120]  I don't think there is one, is there?
[28:27.280 --> 28:27.720]  Spider!
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.520]  Spider hands!
[28:30.940 --> 28:31.600]  Spider hands!
[28:31.600 --> 28:31.760]  Spider hand!
[28:34.240 --> 28:35.840]  Oh, it's got other little spiders!
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.340]  Get him, get him, get him!
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.940]  Oh, the big ones do a lot.
[28:43.540 --> 28:44.440]  Does he even have a health bar?
[28:46.700 --> 28:47.240]  Oh, I'm getting fucked up.
[28:47.240 --> 28:48.020]  I don't see a health bar.
[28:49.400 --> 28:50.560]  Oh, I don't like this.
[28:50.840 --> 28:51.820]  I don't see a health bar, do you?
[28:52.740 --> 28:55.440]  Shit, I'm getting fucked up by a medium-sized one.
[28:56.100 --> 28:57.480]  Oh, guys, there's so many
[28:57.480 --> 28:59.040]  bad guys and so many...
[28:59.040 --> 29:00.280]  Oh, there's so many hands!
[29:01.920 --> 29:03.360]  Burning through all my healing.
[29:03.500 --> 29:05.000]  Oh, this is bad.
[29:11.060 --> 29:11.600]  Fuck.
[29:11.660 --> 29:12.100]  Oh, run away!
[29:12.400 --> 29:12.680]  Run away!
[29:15.160 --> 29:16.260]  Fickle finger of fate!
[29:17.340 --> 29:19.040]  Ow, I got fucking frozen
[29:19.040 --> 29:20.260]  by a gargoyle.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.900]  Okay, the mid-sized one's
[29:22.900 --> 29:23.480]  almost down.
[29:24.000 --> 29:24.720]  I'm getting handed.
[29:26.700 --> 29:27.240]  Nice.
[29:28.860 --> 29:30.660]  Get these fucking gargoyles
[29:30.660 --> 29:31.520]  out of here.
[29:32.460 --> 29:33.840]  Oh, the big one hurts.
[29:35.140 --> 29:36.420]  I killed a hand.
[29:37.160 --> 29:37.560]  Fuck.
[29:38.320 --> 29:39.140]  The big hand's coming for you.
[29:39.140 --> 29:40.040]  I'm out of health potions.
[29:41.640 --> 29:42.780]  Get the babies.
[29:44.120 --> 29:45.180]  I'm coming for you, Andrew.
[29:45.780 --> 29:47.340]  Oh, shit. I missed.
[29:48.160 --> 29:49.580]  I fucked up. I fucked up real bad.
[29:50.080 --> 29:50.880]  Where did the big hand go?
[29:51.080 --> 29:52.060]  Oh, there it is!
[29:53.180 --> 29:54.700]  It definitely has a health bar.
[29:58.350 --> 29:59.230]  Oh, you prick.
[29:59.730 --> 30:01.230]  I need...
[30:01.230 --> 30:02.830]  I'm going to smash him with a hammer.
[30:04.110 --> 30:05.150]  I'm going to go to
[30:05.150 --> 30:06.890]  a level up station.
[30:08.350 --> 30:09.850]  That's what I'm going to do.
[30:11.070 --> 30:11.490]  Oh,
[30:11.650 --> 30:12.950]  Geoff, what is that around you?
[30:13.430 --> 30:14.930]  I don't know. It's something I activated
[30:14.930 --> 30:17.010]  by hitting up on the jitpad.
[30:18.110 --> 30:19.410]  It's where you get your little
[30:20.430 --> 30:21.350]  buffs and stuff.
[30:21.970 --> 30:23.050]  I just keep hitting them on occasion.
[30:24.810 --> 30:25.090]  Ah!
[30:25.790 --> 30:27.250]  Ow. Ow, he flicked me.
[30:27.870 --> 30:28.650]  That hurt a lot.
[30:30.250 --> 30:30.990]  Ow, he flicked
[30:30.990 --> 30:32.130]  me again, son of a bitch.
[30:34.830 --> 30:35.630]  Alright, I healed.
[30:37.950 --> 30:38.970]  What does fire grease
[30:38.970 --> 30:40.990]  do? Oh, it lit my sword
[30:40.990 --> 30:42.710]  afire. That's awesome.
[30:44.130 --> 30:44.970]  Alright, I killed a couple
[30:44.970 --> 30:47.210]  babies. We did it!
[30:47.470 --> 30:48.610]  We killed the hand.
[30:48.910 --> 30:50.890]  Oh, you killed it? Good job, guys. I didn't do
[30:50.890 --> 30:51.950]  anything for that.
[30:52.830 --> 30:55.010]  Oh, the fire's coming! The fire's coming!
[30:55.250 --> 30:56.830]  That was awesome. Good job, us.
[30:56.830 --> 30:57.110]  Yeah!
[31:01.590 --> 31:02.430]  We gotta go!
[31:03.150 --> 31:04.250]  Yeah, we have got to go.
[31:05.510 --> 31:05.910]  Ugh.
[31:06.770 --> 31:08.550]  Can I equip this? Oh, it is equipped.
[31:08.970 --> 31:09.510]  Where do we go?
[31:11.430 --> 31:12.750]  We need to go up somehow.
[31:14.130 --> 31:15.050]  Uh, we should be able
[31:15.050 --> 31:16.890]  to, you know, clamber or whatever.
[31:17.710 --> 31:18.990]  Alright, let's uh...
[31:21.250 --> 31:23.010]  What the hell is this fire here?
[31:23.750 --> 31:24.450]  No idea.
[31:25.270 --> 31:27.030]  There's a cave here. Maybe this is where we go?
[31:27.030 --> 31:29.230]  I think the tree is where we end up needing
[31:29.230 --> 31:31.390]  to be. Or at least it was
[31:31.390 --> 31:33.110]  last time. I felt like it circled on that.
[31:34.990 --> 31:35.310]  Uh...
[31:36.130 --> 31:36.450]  Gasp!
[31:37.730 --> 31:39.390]  Giant crab! Giant crab!
[31:39.930 --> 31:41.250]  That doesn't look good down there.
[31:41.370 --> 31:42.830]  No, I don't think I want to go down there.
[31:43.050 --> 31:43.890]  I don't want to go down there either.
[31:43.890 --> 31:44.730]  What are you thinking?
[31:46.810 --> 31:48.090]  What do you think we should go, Andrew?
[31:48.910 --> 31:51.290]  You know, just wait a minute and kind of see where the...
[31:51.290 --> 31:53.290]  I guess we can't. I guess it's really coming up
[31:53.290 --> 31:55.170]  on our ass. Let's uh...
[31:55.170 --> 31:56.990]  Let's go where Nick is. Let's catch up to Nick.
[31:57.730 --> 31:59.510]  I don't know where we can go up.
[32:00.530 --> 32:01.450]  I see the tree
[32:01.450 --> 32:02.250]  on the rocks.
[32:03.590 --> 32:05.190]  Yeah, let's go. Here comes the fire.
[32:05.330 --> 32:07.410]  Oh, we can go up this blue thing. Come our way, Nick.
[32:07.410 --> 32:08.130]  Nope, we can't. Nevermind.
[32:10.030 --> 32:11.390]  Oh god. How do we get up there?
[32:11.430 --> 32:13.350]  Oh, we're fucked. Oh, we're so
[32:13.350 --> 32:15.330]  fucked. Oh god.
[32:15.810 --> 32:17.030]  Oh god. We're so fucked.
[32:17.650 --> 32:18.970]  How did we get so fucked?
[32:19.770 --> 32:21.430]  We gotta make sure that
[32:21.430 --> 32:23.310]  we get to the tree...
[32:23.310 --> 32:25.410]  zone... next time.
[32:26.570 --> 32:27.910]  Make sure to heal
[32:27.910 --> 32:28.650]  if you need to.
[32:30.070 --> 32:31.010]  I need to.
[32:32.570 --> 32:33.630]  Can we go up here?
[32:34.490 --> 32:35.570]  Spirit stream jump.
[32:35.810 --> 32:37.710]  I'm dead. I'm dead. Can somebody pick me up?
[32:38.110 --> 32:39.950]  I'm still alive. You can save me.
[32:40.290 --> 32:41.310]  I'm coming. Heal.
[32:42.970 --> 32:44.090]  You can save me.
[32:44.250 --> 32:44.670]  I'm coming.
[32:46.450 --> 32:47.650]  You can't save me.
[32:48.710 --> 32:49.070]  Heal.
[32:51.110 --> 32:51.570]  It's alright.
[32:51.570 --> 32:53.230]  It's alright. As long as Andrew lives, we all might live.
[32:53.770 --> 32:55.770]  Yeah, I don't know what happens in this final circle
[32:55.770 --> 32:56.090]  thing.
[32:57.810 --> 32:58.150]  I'm in.
[33:00.610 --> 33:01.730]  Oh shit. Oh, I'm out
[33:01.730 --> 33:03.170]  of potions. Balls.
[33:04.410 --> 33:05.710]  It's not great in here.
[33:06.330 --> 33:07.230]  I'm in. I'm fighting.
[33:07.730 --> 33:09.870]  Well, now that we know we can do that jump, we've learned something
[33:09.870 --> 33:10.210]  else.
[33:11.270 --> 33:12.330]  Try to get your back, Geoff.
[33:12.870 --> 33:13.350]  Thank you.
[33:14.870 --> 33:17.290]  Oh, we got a thing.
[33:17.290 --> 33:17.370]  We got a thing.
[33:19.690 --> 33:21.630]  Hey guys, I'm gonna pop one of these.
[33:23.310 --> 33:24.030]  It's uh...
[33:24.030 --> 33:24.310]  Fuck.
[33:26.210 --> 33:26.950]  I'm gonna try.
[33:27.350 --> 33:27.990]  Alright, I'm back.
[33:28.370 --> 33:29.930]  It's bad. It's bad. It's bad.
[33:31.690 --> 33:33.170]  How do you use items?
[33:34.310 --> 33:34.970]  Uh, you...
[33:34.970 --> 33:36.970]  I think up on the D-pad?
[33:37.170 --> 33:38.390]  Yeah, the one that's equipped will be used.
[33:38.670 --> 33:42.070]  Here, I popped this health thing. If anybody wants to come stand in here, it'll replenish your health.
[33:42.350 --> 33:43.370]  Oh, I would love that.
[33:43.570 --> 33:44.550]  Fight from in here.
[33:44.550 --> 33:44.850]  Ah!
[33:47.090 --> 33:47.810]  Oh, Geoff.
[33:48.190 --> 33:48.850]  Good thinking.
[33:50.390 --> 33:51.790]  Oh! Oh, they came in.
[33:51.810 --> 33:53.110]  It's almost dead. It's almost dead.
[33:53.950 --> 33:55.910]  Nice. Big guy's down. Big guy's down.
[33:56.130 --> 33:57.850]  Big guy is down. Little guy is down.
[33:57.850 --> 34:00.350]  Oh, I did a lot of damage to the little guy.
[34:00.430 --> 34:02.010]  He's gonna die. Okay, we got one more little guy.
[34:03.710 --> 34:04.310]  He's stunned.
[34:05.870 --> 34:06.590]  Mercy. Excellent.
[34:07.530 --> 34:07.850]  Okay.
[34:08.150 --> 34:09.790]  Alright, back to the circle.
[34:10.710 --> 34:11.850]  Uh, hey, I'm gonna do another one, okay?
[34:11.850 --> 34:13.410]  Oh, no!
[34:16.310 --> 34:17.830]  Heal yourselves up as much as you can.
[34:17.930 --> 34:19.130]  I'll try to distract him.
[34:21.510 --> 34:22.350]  Geoff, you're a hero.
[34:27.160 --> 34:28.400]  I'm filling up. Oh, the sword master!
[34:28.640 --> 34:32.400]  Oh, he disappeared! Ow!
[34:34.860 --> 34:35.760]  Okay, I'm chunking him.
[34:36.240 --> 34:37.980]  Alright, I'm healing up. Fuck, fuck, fuck!
[34:38.180 --> 34:40.300]  I need to go heal up.
[34:41.280 --> 34:41.920]  Fuck you.
[34:44.980 --> 34:45.360]  Frick.
[34:45.840 --> 34:46.620]  Shit, I'm down.
[34:50.060 --> 34:51.100]  Oh, thanks, guys.
[34:51.460 --> 34:53.120]  Oh my god, what was that?
[34:53.160 --> 34:54.680]  That was some Dragon Ball Z shit.
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.740]  Yeah, that fucked me up. Oh, don't hit me!
[34:58.680 --> 34:59.260]  Oh, he hit me!
[34:59.360 --> 35:01.020]  Don't forget to heal with a potion if you have it.
[35:01.800 --> 35:03.600]  Oh, I'd love to have one right now.
[35:04.020 --> 35:04.500]  Are you out?
[35:04.600 --> 35:07.720]  Oh, I'm so out. Alright, I think it's...
[35:07.720 --> 35:09.460]  He's low. He's low.
[35:09.960 --> 35:11.200]  Get this little motherfucker.
[35:11.200 --> 35:11.980]  Come on, come on.
[35:13.880 --> 35:15.360]  We got him! We got him!
[35:15.580 --> 35:17.360]  Yes! Alright, break away!
[35:17.760 --> 35:18.780]  Oh! Oh!
[35:21.420 --> 35:23.160]  Okay. Oh no!
[35:23.700 --> 35:24.940]  It spawned so many!
[35:27.540 --> 35:28.940]  What the fuck?
[35:31.780 --> 35:33.580]  Okay, they're weak. They're so weak.
[35:33.940 --> 35:35.300]  They're so weak, thankfully.
[35:35.300 --> 35:36.840]  Left trigger and B is dodge, don't forget.
[35:38.600 --> 35:39.740]  Shit, I'm down again.
[35:40.240 --> 35:41.260]  Where are you?
[35:41.920 --> 35:43.760]  Right by you, Nick. Turn around. Behind you, behind you.
[35:44.900 --> 35:45.540]  Oh god!
[35:45.740 --> 35:47.060]  I gotta swing away for a sec, Andrew.
[35:47.320 --> 35:49.500]  Yeah, that's okay. I just got half of one.
[35:49.900 --> 35:51.740]  I'm gonna get you. I got you!
[35:52.560 --> 35:54.100]  Oh, you guys are the best!
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.540]  Okay, I'm getting chunks in.
[35:57.460 --> 35:57.840]  Oh god.
[35:58.240 --> 35:59.320]  Okay, I'm coming back.
[36:00.540 --> 36:01.960]  Oh shit, little bastard!
[36:03.200 --> 36:04.040]  Come on, come on.
[36:07.610 --> 36:07.930]  Oh!
[36:10.010 --> 36:12.010]  Oh, I don't feel like I'm hitting him at all.
[36:13.010 --> 36:13.730]  He's hitting me.
[36:15.170 --> 36:15.730]  There we go.
[36:15.790 --> 36:17.150]  There we go. There we go. There we go.
[36:20.790 --> 36:21.110]  Oh!
[36:21.690 --> 36:22.330]  Fuck you!
[36:22.790 --> 36:23.110]  Ow!
[36:25.450 --> 36:26.910]  Okay. Oh yeah, I'm out of potions.
[36:28.250 --> 36:29.550]  Gonna have to play this a little more carefully now.
[36:29.550 --> 36:31.070]  Don't forget, you have stamina bar. I completely
[36:31.070 --> 36:32.670]  forgot about it until right now.
[36:33.690 --> 36:35.010]  What does that mean? What does that do?
[36:35.010 --> 36:37.710]  It's a green thing that limits how often you can swing rapidly.
[36:37.910 --> 36:38.570]  You gotta let it heal.
[36:39.490 --> 36:40.190]  Oh, yeah.
[36:42.750 --> 36:43.830]  Doesn't like it when you run.
[36:44.870 --> 36:46.730]  Oh, he's dead. He's fucked. He's fucked. He's fucked.
[36:46.730 --> 36:48.710]  Fuck him up! Oh, run away.
[36:48.710 --> 36:49.590]  Hold on, he's gonna hit ya.
[36:51.370 --> 36:52.350]  Oh, that hurts so bad.
[36:52.370 --> 36:55.390]  Oh, we got him so low. Yes, I blasted him! Nice!
[36:57.670 --> 36:59.610]  Fuck, I hit the wrong button.
[37:00.150 --> 37:00.990]  Hitting him with fire.
[37:01.110 --> 37:02.590]  Fire! There we go. Oh, nice hit!
[37:02.730 --> 37:04.690]  Fire! I'm dying! I'm dying!
[37:04.690 --> 37:06.930]  I'm trying to get you.
[37:06.950 --> 37:07.970]  He's down. He's down.
[37:08.090 --> 37:09.630]  He's dead. Nick, you're up.
[37:10.790 --> 37:12.850]  Oh, you saved me. Excellent work, fellas.
[37:12.950 --> 37:14.970]  Now you rebulst! I think we did it!
[37:16.130 --> 37:17.310]  We can level up!
[37:19.390 --> 37:19.790]  Yes!
[37:24.550 --> 37:25.310]  We did it!
[37:26.330 --> 37:27.530]  What's going on over here?
[37:27.690 --> 37:28.030]  Now what?
[37:30.830 --> 37:31.710]  Oh, dormant power.
[37:31.730 --> 37:34.150]  You pick your dormant power. I picked the top one.
[37:34.230 --> 37:34.890]  I don't know what it is.
[37:34.890 --> 37:37.210]  I picked the one that when I get low health
[37:37.210 --> 37:38.690]  it spawns a health circle.
[37:39.010 --> 37:40.910]  I think the helicopter's extracting us.
[37:44.810 --> 37:46.270]  We've cleaned the land.
[37:46.790 --> 37:48.210]  Oh, it's sunny out now.
[37:48.670 --> 37:49.710]  Day two. Oh no!
[37:50.650 --> 37:51.870]  We keep going! We're not extracted!
[37:52.850 --> 37:53.850]  That's our reward?
[37:53.970 --> 37:54.930]  We have to do this again?
[37:56.250 --> 37:57.430]  We keep going!
[37:57.810 --> 38:00.110]  This is pretty fun. I'm not gonna lie to you.
[38:00.190 --> 38:02.210]  I'm having a lot of fun doing this.
[38:02.310 --> 38:02.650]  This is great.
[38:02.650 --> 38:05.550]  Should we head towards the center of the map?
[38:05.550 --> 38:06.390]  I think we have to, right?
[38:06.430 --> 38:08.670]  Yeah, let's go that way.
[38:08.790 --> 38:09.570]  Alright, I pinged it.
[38:11.010 --> 38:12.550]  There's monsters on the ground.
[38:13.750 --> 38:15.170]  We're higher level at least.
[38:15.730 --> 38:17.050]  Let's kick their ass!
[38:17.810 --> 38:19.190]  Yeah, it's like two hits.
[38:20.090 --> 38:20.190]  Yeah.
[38:20.550 --> 38:21.130]  Fuck them.
[38:21.850 --> 38:22.650]  Fuck them up.
[38:25.170 --> 38:25.990]  A boiled prawn!
[38:25.990 --> 38:28.910]  I was not prepared for us to just go to day two.
[38:29.550 --> 38:30.390]  No, no.
[38:30.390 --> 38:32.950]  I thought they were gonna come ex-fellas.
[38:33.030 --> 38:33.990]  We were gonna go back to base.
[38:34.670 --> 38:36.910]  I was not mentally ready for that.
[38:37.430 --> 38:37.870]  Damn.
[38:37.870 --> 38:39.110]  That was so stressful at the end.
[38:40.670 --> 38:41.310]  Oh, what do we got?
[38:42.470 --> 38:43.930]  A scythe. I don't need it.
[38:46.050 --> 38:48.610]  Seems slow and cumbersome.
[38:52.250 --> 38:53.630]  You ain't being sneaky.
[38:54.210 --> 38:54.850]  I see you.
[38:55.730 --> 38:57.030]  I got you, I got you.
[38:57.030 --> 38:58.470]  Bam, bam, bam.
[38:59.710 --> 39:00.190]  Nice.
[39:00.870 --> 39:01.850]  A boiled crab.
[39:03.930 --> 39:05.690]  And a sacred greatsword, y'all.
[39:05.790 --> 39:06.490]  This looks pretty good.
[39:07.750 --> 39:08.170]  Take it.
[39:09.190 --> 39:10.650]  Show how good it is.
[39:11.350 --> 39:11.790]  Nice.
[39:13.250 --> 39:14.970]  Uh, crab person? No.
[39:15.510 --> 39:16.970]  Uh, spider boss person.
[39:17.910 --> 39:18.810]  Oh, they got some health.
[39:18.910 --> 39:19.790]  They got some health on them.
[39:20.350 --> 39:22.450]  Ouch. Punch me right in the mouth.
[39:23.170 --> 39:23.410]  Healing.
[39:28.310 --> 39:28.990]  That's bad.
[39:31.630 --> 39:32.270]  Oh, God.
[39:33.070 --> 39:34.950]  I'm gonna go down. I'm down, boys.
[39:35.930 --> 39:37.210]  Oh, shit. Hold on, Geoff.
[39:37.690 --> 39:39.790]  Thank you. Knock my dick off.
[39:41.070 --> 39:41.450]  Oh, shit.
[39:41.450 --> 39:42.270]  We got Geoff. We got Geoff.
[39:42.690 --> 39:44.450]  Oh, roll away. Up, up.
[39:44.970 --> 39:45.690]  Oh, shit.
[39:48.670 --> 39:49.290]  Spider lady.
[39:49.870 --> 39:51.490]  Okay, stunned. Doing a big attack.
[39:57.370 --> 39:58.210]  Oh, roll away.
[39:59.310 --> 40:00.850]  It hit me so many times.
[40:03.250 --> 40:04.170]  Okay, I'm out of potions.
[40:05.230 --> 40:05.570]  Argh!
[40:07.630 --> 40:09.150]  Okay, get ready. It's gonna do a secondary.
[40:09.590 --> 40:11.220]  Oh, shit. It's dropping some...
[40:11.790 --> 40:12.710]  Oh, it's spitting acid.
[40:13.210 --> 40:14.370]  Oh, I'm dead. I'm down.
[40:15.410 --> 40:16.310]  Alright, Nick. I'm coming for you.
[40:16.390 --> 40:19.310]  Oh, it's still on me. It's still on me.
[40:19.630 --> 40:20.670]  Andrew, maybe you get Nick.
[40:20.770 --> 40:21.390]  Yeah, I'm getting Nick.
[40:21.450 --> 40:22.450]  Oh, it's coming for you, Andrew.
[40:25.290 --> 40:26.810]  Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[40:29.110 --> 40:30.250]  It's still chasing me.
[40:32.130 --> 40:33.510]  Let it have it.
[40:33.750 --> 40:38.670]  Oh, come on. Come on. Fuck you. Fuck you.
[40:39.430 --> 40:40.770]  Kill it before it hits us with the thing.
[40:41.270 --> 40:42.570]  Oh, we got it.
[40:42.770 --> 40:43.130]  Oh, down.
[40:43.370 --> 40:43.930]  Pepsi's down.
[40:46.270 --> 40:46.850]  I'm down.
[40:47.910 --> 40:48.590]  Okay, it's dead.
[40:49.510 --> 40:50.570]  Alright, Gizmo, it's all you.
[40:53.550 --> 40:54.850]  You feel like after a great
[40:54.850 --> 40:56.810]  enemy fell, it should be like, you can get up now.
[40:57.010 --> 40:57.310]  Yeah, right.
[40:59.350 --> 40:59.750]  Yes!
[41:01.490 --> 41:02.290]  Thank you.
[41:02.410 --> 41:02.870]  What do we get?
[41:07.190 --> 41:07.990]  A curbsaw?
[41:10.930 --> 41:12.250]  Alright. Oh, I'm gonna take that.
[41:12.770 --> 41:13.050]  That.
[41:14.270 --> 41:15.950]  We gotta level up right next to it.
[41:17.670 --> 41:18.470]  Level eight.
[41:19.330 --> 41:20.130]  Level seven.
[41:20.910 --> 41:22.790]  We should keep moving in, I guess.
[41:22.850 --> 41:24.310]  Yeah, let's do it.
[41:25.350 --> 41:26.670]  Oh, we're moving a little
[41:27.090 --> 41:27.770]  this way.
[41:28.750 --> 41:29.930]  Oh, we got some people up here.
[41:30.510 --> 41:31.290]  Should we go south-ish?
[41:33.290 --> 41:34.130]  Where's the tree?
[41:35.910 --> 41:36.630]  You can see it
[41:36.630 --> 41:38.430]  off in the distance there, it looks like, or something.
[41:39.990 --> 41:40.730]  It's not on the map.
[41:43.590 --> 41:44.650]  I'm curious if we
[41:44.650 --> 41:47.010]  run over, because this looks like a level up station
[41:47.010 --> 41:49.390]  over here. Will it give us
[41:49.390 --> 41:51.090]  more potions just for running into it?
[41:52.390 --> 41:53.030]  I'm at three.
[41:53.950 --> 41:55.470]  No, it doesn't go above three.
[41:58.510 --> 41:59.050]  Oh, used
[41:59.050 --> 42:01.070]  suck. Okay, that sucked.
[42:02.170 --> 42:02.910]  Fuck you.
[42:04.330 --> 42:04.730]  Hmm.
[42:05.190 --> 42:06.870]  What if I use one and then run?
[42:07.570 --> 42:09.270]  Okay, yeah, so it'll recharge to three
[42:09.270 --> 42:11.390]  every time. We got a little camp of guys, it looks like
[42:11.390 --> 42:12.850]  over here, to the right of it.
[42:16.690 --> 42:17.790]  Oh, yeah, it's a camp.
[42:18.110 --> 42:19.090]  It's a camp.
[42:20.750 --> 42:21.490]  Kill camp.
[42:22.090 --> 42:22.850]  Kill camp.
[42:24.270 --> 42:25.070]  Oh, damn.
[42:25.610 --> 42:26.410]  Yeah, it was a kill camp.
[42:26.650 --> 42:29.370]  They came here to die. Oh, there's some chests
[42:29.370 --> 42:30.470]  over here. I'll get this one.
[42:31.710 --> 42:32.850]  Oh, good eyes.
[42:33.230 --> 42:34.990]  Oh, there's a guy. Yeah, there's two guys.
[42:35.910 --> 42:37.330]  Oh, that little prick ran me through.
[42:44.990 --> 42:45.430]  Nah.
[42:46.970 --> 42:47.410]  Nah.
[42:47.410 --> 42:48.070]  Nah.
[42:50.250 --> 42:51.570]  Okay, we got the circle coming in. It's time.
[42:51.630 --> 42:53.590]  We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta prioritize
[42:54.030 --> 42:55.410]  getting to that bottom left.
[42:55.930 --> 42:56.670]  Let's start running.
[42:57.710 --> 42:58.890]  Feeling pretty good about this.
[42:59.530 --> 43:01.770]  I think we go across and then down. So do I.
[43:01.870 --> 43:03.670]  I'm mainly worried about
[43:03.670 --> 43:05.430]  the circle. Let's not even fight these guys.
[43:05.550 --> 43:06.470]  Let's just go past them and run.
[43:06.470 --> 43:08.290]  Run by these dumb losers.
[43:09.550 --> 43:11.850]  You're not worth our time. Ain't worth it.
[43:15.170 --> 43:16.390]  I wonder how many days there are.
[43:16.510 --> 43:17.870]  I guess as many as you can survive, maybe?
[43:17.990 --> 43:18.870]  I assume, yeah.
[43:19.630 --> 43:21.870]  Oh, here's that
[43:22.450 --> 43:23.130]  super jump.
[43:24.130 --> 43:26.230]  I guess we don't.
[43:26.750 --> 43:27.850]  I killed all those guys.
[43:29.730 --> 43:30.130]  Nick,
[43:30.870 --> 43:32.030]  you're in trouble, man.
[43:32.610 --> 43:34.010]  That circle's coming in on you.
[43:37.030 --> 43:37.330]  Uh-oh.
[43:38.530 --> 43:39.790]  No, good job. You made it.
[43:39.830 --> 43:40.410]  You made the turn.
[43:41.150 --> 43:41.970]  Great work, Nick.
[43:42.510 --> 43:43.290]  Thanks for the XP.
[43:44.910 --> 43:46.370]  Do we want to go up this thing?
[43:46.910 --> 43:47.930]  Let's just keep going straight.
[43:48.150 --> 43:49.770]  We're gonna get in the next circle.
[43:51.450 --> 43:52.610]  Maybe once it circles
[43:52.610 --> 43:54.590]  on this, maybe it'll show where the tree is?
[43:58.920 --> 44:00.140]  We got some people to the left.
[44:00.260 --> 44:01.720]  We can get them, get some more XP.
[44:02.200 --> 44:03.360]  Yeah, let's fuck them up.
[44:06.560 --> 44:07.960]  Fuck you, porn guy.
[44:10.720 --> 44:11.160]  Brrrr.
[44:11.700 --> 44:12.600]  Oh, I'm late
[44:12.600 --> 44:13.380]  to the party.
[44:15.320 --> 44:16.200]  Happy birthday.
[44:17.120 --> 44:17.560]  Brrrr.
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.440]  Oh, what's that? Something shiny.
[44:22.600 --> 44:23.720]  Is that a level up spot?
[44:24.480 --> 44:25.060]  Oh, yeah.
[44:25.460 --> 44:28.460]  I'm nowhere close
[44:28.460 --> 44:29.460]  to the XP I need.
[44:31.000 --> 44:32.400]  A bunch of guys hung
[44:32.400 --> 44:33.760]  from the side of the castle. Whoops.
[44:34.800 --> 44:36.440]  Oh, yeah.
[44:36.440 --> 44:38.380]  Those guys are not having a good day.
[44:38.620 --> 44:40.460]  No, speaking of guys that are not having a good day,
[44:40.500 --> 44:41.420]  these guys are about to not.
[44:42.220 --> 44:44.620]  Let's get them. How dare you scream at me.
[44:45.600 --> 44:46.620]  I need to double the
[44:46.620 --> 44:48.680]  XP I currently have. This is good.
[44:50.180 --> 44:50.760]  Oh, I see
[44:50.760 --> 44:52.580]  some dudes. I'm going into
[44:52.580 --> 44:54.480]  the castle. They're digging.
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.660]  Oh, Nick, you're fighting a lot of dudes, huh?
[44:58.880 --> 44:59.160]  Yeah.
[45:00.320 --> 45:02.560]  I think there's a boss in the castle, so I'm going
[45:02.560 --> 45:04.680]  back down. We'll come in with you.
[45:05.220 --> 45:06.740]  Ow! Well, it was a first.
[45:07.320 --> 45:08.980]  A hundred dudes were fighting right now first.
[45:09.300 --> 45:10.120]  Yeah, let's get them.
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.120]  Oh, maybe not. He looked like this guy.
[45:14.140 --> 45:15.060]  Oh, this guy's
[45:15.060 --> 45:16.840]  tough. Yeah, he seems
[45:16.840 --> 45:18.760]  bad. That's a tough guy. He's all business.
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.700]  Get out of the way!
[45:25.500 --> 45:26.740]  Jesus Christ, Geoff.
[45:27.200 --> 45:28.940]  That's a heal situation for
[45:28.940 --> 45:30.980]  sure. That is definitely a
[45:30.980 --> 45:32.340]  heal. I'm going to need a heal.
[45:35.240 --> 45:37.040]  Gotcha, prick. Nice.
[45:37.960 --> 45:38.940]  Oh, I need a heal.
[45:39.460 --> 45:41.220]  Lay into him, lay into him.
[45:42.980 --> 45:44.900]  Oh, we're trying to...
[45:47.420 --> 45:49.040]  He is locked on to you.
[45:49.980 --> 45:50.820]  Made him mad.
[45:52.020 --> 45:52.820]  He's so weak.
[45:53.840 --> 45:54.380]  There we go.
[45:56.740 --> 45:57.740]  Nice job.
[45:59.600 --> 46:00.980]  Let's go back to
[46:00.980 --> 46:01.500]  the level up.
[46:03.220 --> 46:03.800]  Get some
[46:03.800 --> 46:04.680]  more potions.
[46:08.340 --> 46:09.300]  Dude, we're
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.160]  getting a feel for this.
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.780]  Very good at this game, maybe the best in the world so far.
[46:17.280 --> 46:19.500]  Maybe we just don't include the first run
[46:19.500 --> 46:20.160]  in the video.
[46:21.440 --> 46:22.840]  No, we need to show growth.
[46:23.100 --> 46:25.440]  We need to show how good we are now compared to
[46:25.440 --> 46:25.960]  when we started.
[46:26.760 --> 46:29.500]  Do we want to try going in here and fighting another one of those
[46:29.500 --> 46:31.400]  big dudes? Yeah, let's do it.
[46:32.080 --> 46:33.740]  I'm just looking at the map as well
[46:33.740 --> 46:36.000]  to try to see where there's any indication.
[46:36.200 --> 46:36.460]  Hey, prick.
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.740]  About to be a bad day for you, son.
[46:49.120 --> 46:51.200]  Why are you picking on me?
[46:54.600 --> 46:55.520]  Oh, good dodge,
[46:55.720 --> 46:55.820]  Geoff.
[46:57.360 --> 46:58.320]  Terrible dodge, Andrew.
[47:04.730 --> 47:06.110]  Get him, get him, get him.
[47:06.110 --> 47:07.530]  Get him, he's down. Take his lunch money.
[47:09.050 --> 47:09.730]  Give it.
[47:10.010 --> 47:10.970]  Give it, nerd.
[47:14.590 --> 47:16.530]  I'll teach you to bring your lunch, nerd.
[47:17.150 --> 47:18.390]  We got a chest
[47:18.390 --> 47:19.570]  over here I'm opening.
[47:20.370 --> 47:21.150]  Ooh, a fire pot.
[47:22.410 --> 47:24.450]  Another chest. Another chest
[47:24.450 --> 47:25.850]  over here. Ooh,
[47:26.410 --> 47:28.310]  that's a fancy envoy's grain horn.
[47:28.390 --> 47:29.030]  Look at this thing.
[47:31.350 --> 47:32.190]  I'm gonna take this.
[47:32.730 --> 47:34.090]  Somebody else wants it. Somebody else take it.
[47:34.090 --> 47:36.430]  No, you take it. No, no, no. I have nice swords
[47:36.430 --> 47:37.230]  already. You snag that.
[47:38.850 --> 47:40.290]  You wanna get this guy over here?
[47:40.370 --> 47:41.110]  We got another one.
[47:42.090 --> 47:43.590]  Let's do it. How do we get over there?
[47:46.190 --> 47:48.170]  Drop him down. We have to go up
[47:48.170 --> 47:49.030]  and over the rampart.
[47:52.700 --> 47:53.240]  I'm here.
[47:54.200 --> 47:55.880]  Waiting on y'all. Over here.
[48:01.630 --> 48:03.050]  Alright. Oh, Nick.
[48:03.150 --> 48:04.290]  Just going right in. Let's get him.
[48:06.490 --> 48:08.190]  That's how Nick rolls. Yeah, dude.
[48:08.190 --> 48:10.230]  Ain't no time to waste.
[48:10.670 --> 48:11.230]  Ooh.
[48:13.290 --> 48:13.850]  Ooh.
[48:16.230 --> 48:17.830]  Okay. Chunking him.
[48:25.810 --> 48:26.410]  Oh, he's
[48:26.410 --> 48:28.210]  still alive. Okay.
[48:28.290 --> 48:29.750]  Not anymore. Rain gathers.
[48:30.150 --> 48:31.370]  Okay, I think we gotta
[48:32.790 --> 48:34.010]  We gotta start moving.
[48:35.970 --> 48:36.530]  Alright.
[48:38.790 --> 48:39.570]  Which way?
[48:40.550 --> 48:42.250]  There's another one in front of us. Oh, the
[48:42.250 --> 48:44.530]  tree's appeared. It's northwest.
[48:45.210 --> 48:46.490]  Look, there it is. You wanna go around
[48:46.490 --> 48:48.470]  this guy? We gotta
[48:48.470 --> 48:50.170]  circle back. Alright.
[48:50.470 --> 48:52.510]  Let's head to the tree area. Let's swing by that
[48:52.510 --> 48:54.430]  healing level up area that we
[48:54.430 --> 48:56.530]  had behind us. Oh, we're right
[48:56.530 --> 48:58.090]  next to the tree. This is perfect.
[49:02.430 --> 49:04.130]  Should be able to get to level 10.
[49:04.670 --> 49:06.250]  Have three potions.
[49:08.790 --> 49:10.490]  Ooh, level 10, baby.
[49:10.750 --> 49:11.710]  Level 9.
[49:12.470 --> 49:13.270]  More behind you.
[49:15.150 --> 49:15.970]  I think you died
[49:15.970 --> 49:18.150]  one time, right? This guy. Yeah, I got messy
[49:18.150 --> 49:18.550]  in the
[49:19.910 --> 49:21.850]  Oh, you guys are just one-hittin' them.
[49:21.950 --> 49:23.730]  It's beautiful. Oh, it's so nice.
[49:24.810 --> 49:25.710]  Remember when we couldn't
[49:25.710 --> 49:27.430]  get each other up? Yes.
[49:30.610 --> 49:32.150]  Man, what a weird sentence that is.
[49:33.570 --> 49:33.890]  Yeah,
[49:34.070 --> 49:36.010]  it is. But for the record, Nick,
[49:36.030 --> 49:37.870]  you can get me up. Don't worry. I have faith.
[49:38.150 --> 49:40.110]  Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
[49:41.390 --> 49:42.550]  I think
[49:42.550 --> 49:44.010]  we can just hold, Gil.
[49:44.450 --> 49:46.270]  Yeah. It closes
[49:46.270 --> 49:48.610]  in on us. We got an orb
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.390]  over there? Okay, we're closing in.
[49:50.610 --> 49:52.270]  I never felt so ready. It's locking
[49:52.270 --> 49:52.710]  in.
[49:54.270 --> 49:56.090]  I'm so nervous. Here it comes.
[49:57.370 --> 49:57.890]  Here it comes.
[49:59.530 --> 50:00.190]  We got like
[50:00.190 --> 50:02.310]  troll guys or something? Oh,
[50:02.790 --> 50:04.390]  they are, guys, they are really
[50:04.390 --> 50:04.910]  strong.
[50:06.770 --> 50:08.110]  Yeah, this big dude is strong.
[50:09.250 --> 50:10.430]  Not immune to fire,
[50:10.510 --> 50:10.690]  though.
[50:12.950 --> 50:14.230]  I'm switching to a
[50:14.910 --> 50:15.890]  or lightning
[50:16.630 --> 50:18.330]  ranged attacker. Oh, my
[50:18.330 --> 50:19.910]  God. Oh, he grabbed me!
[50:20.810 --> 50:22.150]  He body slammed me.
[50:31.650 --> 50:33.910]  He's coming for you, Geoff. I know.
[50:34.770 --> 50:35.890]  I'm not crazy about
[50:35.890 --> 50:36.210]  it.
[50:38.010 --> 50:39.690]  Ow. Motherfucker.
[50:45.430 --> 50:46.330]  Oh, shit.
[50:48.310 --> 50:48.990]  Nice hit.
[50:49.530 --> 50:49.930]  Oh!
[50:52.210 --> 50:53.850]  Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[50:54.310 --> 50:56.610]  Dodge, dodge, dodge. Oh, oh, shit.
[50:57.390 --> 50:58.590]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[50:59.550 --> 51:00.750]  I'm about to get in close.
[51:00.850 --> 51:02.530]  I'm out of range right now.
[51:04.970 --> 51:05.370]  Ow.
[51:07.130 --> 51:08.250]  He put a hurtin' on me.
[51:09.590 --> 51:09.990]  Fuck.
[51:13.360 --> 51:13.760]  Frick.
[51:13.880 --> 51:14.980]  I don't remember what these do.
[51:14.980 --> 51:17.500]  Oh, I'm so weak.
[51:19.240 --> 51:19.920]  You're doing great, Nick.
[51:21.400 --> 51:23.680]  I got one of these
[51:24.820 --> 51:25.640]  stand in place
[51:25.640 --> 51:26.880]  and heal things. I'm putting it down.
[51:33.390 --> 51:34.150]  Good job, Geoff.
[51:36.250 --> 51:36.670]  Fuck.
[51:39.170 --> 51:39.910]  Oh, I'm down.
[51:40.050 --> 51:40.430]  I'm down.
[51:42.190 --> 51:43.070]  Behind you, Geoff.
[51:43.410 --> 51:43.770]  I got this guy.
[51:45.250 --> 51:46.210]  Alright, I'm coming for you.
[51:48.810 --> 51:49.450]  Thank you.
[51:49.470 --> 51:50.150]  Oh, fuck. Frick.
[51:53.030 --> 51:54.770]  Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[52:00.130 --> 52:00.730]  Oh, boy.
[52:00.930 --> 52:01.790]  Now we got a boss.
[52:02.290 --> 52:03.630]  Oh, boy. We got this guy.
[52:04.610 --> 52:06.210]  Oh, no. Ow, shit, oh, shit.
[52:06.350 --> 52:07.790]  This is the boss we faced in the intro.
[52:08.290 --> 52:08.610]  Fuck.
[52:10.630 --> 52:11.890]  I'm in a bad way, boys.
[52:12.050 --> 52:13.390]  I think it's the tutorial boss, Geoff.
[52:14.010 --> 52:15.310]  Oh, no. Oh, shit.
[52:16.750 --> 52:17.550]  I'll go for Andrew.
[52:17.550 --> 52:18.330]  Okay.
[52:19.870 --> 52:22.010]  Oh, fuck. There's another creature by him.
[52:22.710 --> 52:23.870]  Dude, I'm dead. I'm down.
[52:24.710 --> 52:25.370]  This was...
[52:25.370 --> 52:27.310]  This was bad business here.
[52:29.650 --> 52:31.410]  Alright, get up, Andrew. Let's get Geoff.
[52:31.570 --> 52:32.510]  Okay, let's get Geoff.
[52:33.150 --> 52:35.150]  I'll see if I can...
[52:35.150 --> 52:36.630]  Got him. Nice job.
[52:54.850 --> 52:56.370]  I'm working on his friend.
[52:58.770 --> 53:01.270]  If we can kill the little guy, the big guy will be easier.
[53:01.290 --> 53:02.370]  Got him. Sorry. Yeah.
[53:04.150 --> 53:04.590]  Okay.
[53:05.330 --> 53:06.610]  Fuck. I'm down.
[53:07.230 --> 53:08.170]  Right next to you, Geoff.
[53:08.590 --> 53:09.750]  Alright, I'll get you.
[53:10.650 --> 53:11.950]  He stomped on me.
[53:13.050 --> 53:13.690]  Oh, goodness.
[53:14.970 --> 53:16.950]  Oh, God. Please let me get you.
[53:17.670 --> 53:18.310]  Okay, I got Geoff.
[53:18.390 --> 53:20.650]  Nice. Geoff, I'm trying.
[53:21.070 --> 53:21.830]  Let's go down.
[53:23.230 --> 53:23.890]  Oh, God.
[53:23.890 --> 53:25.110]  I'm trying to get you.
[53:25.190 --> 53:26.550]  Thank you. I got one more bar.
[53:30.470 --> 53:31.790]  Got one more bar.
[53:32.150 --> 53:33.350]  I know. I'm trying.
[53:35.010 --> 53:35.830]  I got one more...
[53:36.270 --> 53:36.930]  Get him.
[53:38.190 --> 53:38.870]  Thank you.
[53:39.590 --> 53:40.290]  I'm down.
[53:41.310 --> 53:42.090]  Alright, you're up.
[53:42.950 --> 53:45.750]  Okay. I got Nick.
[53:45.950 --> 53:47.690]  Oh, shit. Geoff will be one second.
[53:48.050 --> 53:49.830]  No worries. Take your time. I got three full bars.
[53:49.950 --> 53:50.490]  It's gonna be a minute.
[53:52.090 --> 53:54.030]  Fuck. Kay's on me, Nick.
[53:54.030 --> 53:55.130]  Okay, I'm down again.
[53:55.310 --> 53:56.190]  Oh, this is bad.
[53:58.910 --> 54:01.490]  If it's easier just to beat the boss...
[54:01.490 --> 54:01.950]  Oh, I'm down.
[54:03.890 --> 54:04.930]  I think that's it.
[54:05.250 --> 54:06.110]  Oh, man.
[54:06.870 --> 54:07.590]  Good run, though.
[54:07.930 --> 54:09.850]  We've got a little bit of room to grow and improve.
[54:10.110 --> 54:10.570]  Absolutely.
[54:11.990 --> 54:14.310]  We did so much better. 129 enemies.
[54:15.110 --> 54:16.210]  Four great enemies fell.
[54:16.410 --> 54:18.210]  Rescued 13 times.
[54:19.110 --> 54:19.790]  Damn. What a run.
[54:20.370 --> 54:21.630]  That's pretty impressive.
[54:23.510 --> 54:24.630]  Good job, fellas.
[54:24.910 --> 54:25.890]  That was great.
[54:27.010 --> 54:28.510]  I had so much fun.
