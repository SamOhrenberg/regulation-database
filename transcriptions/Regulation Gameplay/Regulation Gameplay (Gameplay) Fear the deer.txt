[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Oh, what a load of bull.
[00:02.820 --> 00:05.300]  You fat sack of deer shit.
[00:06.220 --> 00:07.560]  No, no, no, no!
[00:07.800 --> 00:08.120]  What are you doing?
[00:09.620 --> 00:11.680]  I'm going back halfway around the track.
[00:14.940 --> 00:15.580]  No!
[00:16.120 --> 00:18.340]  Not here, not here, not here.
[00:20.620 --> 00:22.800]  The stress of seeing other people.
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.460]  No!
[00:24.380 --> 00:24.600]  Yes!
[00:26.260 --> 00:26.580]  No!
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.720]  Who did that to me?
[00:31.320 --> 00:31.800]  No!
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.040]  The deer.
[00:34.340 --> 00:35.860]  Look at his stupid eyes.
[00:36.660 --> 00:38.480]  Look at his stupid face.
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.220]  I'm going the wrong way.
[00:40.400 --> 00:41.780]  You're going so far back.
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.380]  I'm going the wrong way.
[00:43.600 --> 00:46.280]  The deer's going the wrong way and you're the only person on the course.
[00:46.440 --> 00:47.180]  There's no one to catch.
