[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Oh, shit!
[00:02.220 --> 00:03.760]  Oh, you did it! You did it!
[00:04.340 --> 00:05.160]  Alright, let's hook him up.
[00:05.600 --> 00:06.460]  More? Or is it good?
[00:08.280 --> 00:11.520]  What if the hook team just holds the crate and then holds a hook?
[00:14.560 --> 00:16.620]  That's a pretty good all-in drill.
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.160]  All-in drill.
[00:18.180 --> 00:18.880]  Where is it moving away?
[00:19.320 --> 00:20.180]  Pull it! Pull it!
[00:20.180 --> 00:20.940]  Oh, it's pulling us!
[00:21.260 --> 00:22.060]  It's pulling us!
[00:22.480 --> 00:23.100]  It's pulling us!
[00:23.100 --> 00:23.600]  It's pulling us!
[00:24.200 --> 00:25.540]  Bring it off the side!
[00:25.740 --> 00:26.620]  You gotta pull me up!
[00:27.760 --> 00:29.560]  Alright, I've got an arm on the crate...
[00:29.560 --> 00:30.500]  and an arm on the hook.
[00:30.820 --> 00:31.220]  Lift!
[00:32.060 --> 00:32.460]  Lift!
[00:32.460 --> 00:32.860]  Alright, hold on.
[00:33.220 --> 00:34.080]  Lift all the way up!
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.220]  Wait, wait, wait, let me do the same!
[00:35.340 --> 00:35.800]  Let me do the same!
[00:37.200 --> 00:38.140]  Okay, I got it!
[00:38.260 --> 00:38.620]  That's it!
[00:38.940 --> 00:39.580]  Take us up!
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.140]  Oh my god!
[00:42.580 --> 00:43.780]  Oh my god!
[00:44.020 --> 00:45.020]  That's amazing!
[00:45.300 --> 00:46.280]  Now, where do you guys go?
[00:47.360 --> 00:50.300]  I'm like the rock in that shitty skyscraper movie!
