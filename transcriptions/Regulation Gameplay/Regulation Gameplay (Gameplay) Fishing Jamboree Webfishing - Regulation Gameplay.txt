[00:00.000 --> 00:05.780]  Hello and welcome to another regulation gameplay. We got a special one for you today.
[00:05.900 --> 00:10.100]  This is me, the little orange guy with the hamburger t-shirt and the McDonald's hat on.
[00:10.480 --> 00:15.440]  Upside down McDonald's hat. I've been spending some time in a game that came to me
[00:16.620 --> 00:24.680]  through Gus via Barb. It is called Web Fishing and I was told it is taking the internet by storm
[00:24.680 --> 00:29.220]  and it is essentially all of the fishing aspects of Animal Crossing with none of the other parts.
[00:29.220 --> 00:37.320]  So I thought, you know what? Every December, Gavin, I always get the urge to fish a little bit.
[00:37.400 --> 00:42.560]  You know what I mean? I don't know why, I don't know what it is. Every December? Yeah, somewhere
[00:42.560 --> 00:49.620]  around like December 7th usually. I end up just like feeling that fishing itch and so I thought
[00:49.620 --> 00:57.260]  maybe we could have ourselves a little, I don't know, fishing jamboree? Yeah, baby! Oh, we fishing!
[00:58.400 --> 01:04.240]  It is, uh, that's right. We're not in Minecraft. We are in Web Fishing, a game designed solely for
[01:04.240 --> 01:07.580]  fishing enjoyment. Do you guys want to do some fishing with me? I'm going to the water right now.
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.440]  Sure. If you, oh by the way, everybody looks, can you see the, uh, you see where we are here?
[01:11.620 --> 01:15.740]  Yeah, you're in the, we're in the fart zone. Yeah, if you're over here, you're in the fart zone.
[01:15.940 --> 01:22.100]  Fart zone? No, I see. Be careful of that. Oh, graffiti. I want to go to the dock. Yeah, you get, you can buy
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.060]  crayon, you can buy, uh, chalk. I want to fish my way to a crayon. It's pretty cool. So, uh,
[01:27.060 --> 01:31.360]  Geoff, where are we going? Well, I can take you guys someplace a little special if you want. Yeah,
[01:31.580 --> 01:37.480]  sure. You know what's insane? Go to my private island. What? Private island? What's insane is the
[01:37.480 --> 01:45.940]  way Eric says crayon. Crayon? Is it crayon? Crayon? Crayon? Crayon? How do I say it? I drown.
[01:46.380 --> 01:52.380]  Crayon? You just say it like C-R-A-N. Crayon? Where's the private island? Where did you guys go?
[01:52.380 --> 01:59.840]  Oh, wow, look at the island. Wow, what an island! Wow, and it says no, it says no Andrews. That's crazy.
[02:00.220 --> 02:07.100]  What? No, it doesn't. Where? Just so you, uh, Andrew, where'd you go? I was going to the sea.
[02:08.380 --> 02:13.780]  Andrew, jump on this. Geoff, come back to town. I'm here, I'm here. Jump on that, yeah, jump on that.
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.060]  Mushrooms are how you get around in the game. Uh, so if you, if you fish here, that's gonna be
[02:22.060 --> 02:25.680]  freshwater. That's awesome. If you fish over here, it's gonna be saltwater. They're different. Oh, cool.
[02:26.340 --> 02:30.560]  Me and Nick are both reeling in fish right now. Are you reeling in the same fish? I don't know, we're
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.720]  gonna find out. No, I got, I got a new creature. I'm all about new creatures. It's a salmon.
[02:36.200 --> 02:40.040]  Now, the, uh, the way it worked in the, uh, old Achievement 100 days is we'd have a fishing
[02:40.040 --> 02:45.200]  competition. We'd fish for 30 minutes and whoever caught the most fish won. Uh, it, Eric's been
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.300]  fishing for a couple minutes before the video started. I've been fishing for, uh, you know, 10-12
[02:49.300 --> 02:55.060]  hours. I think it would be pretty unfair given my upgrades and stuff. So instead, why, why, why do we
[02:55.060 --> 02:59.160]  need to compete? Why can't we just enjoy each other's company? Have a day of fishing. Just fish for a while
[02:59.160 --> 03:06.040]  and just have a day relaxing. Yeah, exactly. We did two fucking podcasts today, but I gotta say,
[03:06.140 --> 03:11.640]  on our podcast scale, we're both above seven. Well, yeah, I think so. Is that how you felt? Because you
[03:11.640 --> 03:15.980]  said that you rate them pretty low. Like, just typically. I know, that tells you how, how well I feel about this one.
[03:15.980 --> 03:23.720]  It's pretty interesting. I found Nemo. Did you get any bites? Clownfish? Yeah, Geoff, so. Oh, I just got a two star. So we're fishing
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.020]  right now, but is there something we need to, like, look out for, for like, here's where the fish are,
[03:28.020 --> 03:33.560]  or like, aim for the really... Sometimes there'll be a little ripple in the water. You'll know that that'll
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.440]  be a fish, but, uh, and those will typically be, like, more valuable. Uh-huh. Like, they'll be, they'll have
[03:39.440 --> 03:46.520]  stars attached to them. Okay. Uh, you'll, you can also cast, uh, out and catch, like, treasure chests and stuff.
[03:46.980 --> 03:51.280]  And I caught a frog. If we leave the private island at some point, there's another place you can go,
[03:51.320 --> 03:55.600]  and you can buy, uh, you can actually buy a metal detector. Oh, cool. You can go, like, comb the beach for
[03:55.600 --> 04:02.120]  shit. Oh, this is a cool game. This is really neat. And we can also buy, like, shit to make, like, props
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.280]  to take with us. So if you want to have, like, a boom box to play music or, like, a picnic table,
[04:06.280 --> 04:13.500]  that kind of stuff, we can. It's really cute. Oh, whoa. Gavin's getting a big bite. Look at that.
[04:13.880 --> 04:18.260]  It was huge. I love how big the fucking fish are. I like their size appropriate.
[04:19.460 --> 04:26.020]  Gavin, I want to see what you got. Gavin, show me. Gavin, show me. I'm losing it. Gavin, what is it? Oh, I'm getting it.
[04:26.540 --> 04:31.080]  I'm getting it. Gavin, where'd it go? I don't really understand when I should mash and what the bars on the line are.
[04:31.180 --> 04:35.720]  When, when it does the lines, it tells, there's, like, a number next to it. That's how many times
[04:35.720 --> 04:42.060]  you have to mash and then you can hold again. I got a krill. Is the red, is the red catching up,
[04:42.120 --> 04:51.160]  the fish getting away? Yeah. Okay, got it. Oh, I caught a new creature. Ah, no, no. Oh, no, Andrew.
[04:53.520 --> 04:57.680]  What's going on, buddy? Gavin tried to catch me and I chased him and I accidentally walked
[04:57.680 --> 05:04.160]  into a mushroom. How do you shove? Don't you touch me, Gavin. You know what? I don't know,
[05:04.160 --> 05:10.020]  but there is a store that sells boxing gloves. Oh, that's cool. So I think you can punch. How do,
[05:10.220 --> 05:15.920]  whoa, what button was that? Whoa, are you doing an emote? No, I'm just dancing. Oh, Gavin.
[05:16.900 --> 05:23.820]  I'm mad at you for dancing. Double, double tapping spaces near the water is good. Whoa, cool.
[05:24.980 --> 05:29.540]  It's, uh, it's like how you would slide through a tube. Yeah, if I was real lubed up.
[05:30.460 --> 05:34.000]  It's, oh, what do I got? Hey, check it out, guys. I got blue fish. I got Nemo's dad.
[05:34.600 --> 05:39.580]  We got the set. Can you catch a blue whale? Oh, I have not yet. Oh, do you guys want to see
[05:39.580 --> 05:45.220]  something cool? I got two. I caught a smaller krill. Bucket. Bucket. And, uh, inside my bucket
[05:45.220 --> 05:49.480]  is my fishing buddy. And then he catches fish in that bucket while I'm catching fish out here.
[05:50.240 --> 05:52.900]  And then every once in a while, he'll just say, your buddy caught a fish. Cool. I'll give it to
[05:52.900 --> 05:59.080]  you. I got a huge, I got a huge shrimp. Oh, yeah. A little frog fishing. No frog fish.
[05:59.980 --> 06:05.120]  You gigging? Can I fish in your bucket? Don't say that in my presence. Uh, maybe you can try. I
[06:05.120 --> 06:10.820]  didn't know you guys were that close. I think I can buy a well that we can fish out of. This is a
[06:10.820 --> 06:15.800]  cool little game. Is it a soda well? It's pretty deep, too. Yeah, it's definitely a soda well.
[06:16.740 --> 06:23.560]  Uh, clean mines. If you guys want to, there's a, you see the fishing pole I have is a spectral,
[06:24.200 --> 06:28.560]  there's a, there's hidden bones around the world you can dig up. And if you have enough money,
[06:28.560 --> 06:33.220]  you can buy a fishing pole. Look at the size of this son of a bitch. I got a new type of bait.
[06:33.920 --> 06:39.900]  Wow, Nick, what's that? This is a huge flounder. Flounder? Wow. I hardly know her.
[06:40.040 --> 06:47.640]  Oh, I got a small oyster. What a small fish for Geoff. Poor Geoff. Geoff, there are no small fish,
[06:47.680 --> 06:52.300]  only small people. That's true. Only small fishermen. Yeah. Nah, I can't fish in the bucket.
[06:52.380 --> 06:53.240]  Yeah, I was gonna say, how's that going?
[06:56.040 --> 07:01.020]  I got fish on this. I'm gonna try to tangle lines with Geoff. Ooh, sounds hot.
[07:03.700 --> 07:08.580]  Geoff, do you have like a, do you have like a, like a special way to do it where you're like,
[07:08.640 --> 07:13.500]  oh, like if you tap it a couple times, or you just sort of... No, there's not really any. Sometimes,
[07:13.700 --> 07:19.700]  I think, I think maybe the game handles different, uh, different bait differently. They don't
[07:19.700 --> 07:25.320]  explicitly say it, but I feel like I have more luck when I'm using the bait I have right now.
[07:25.520 --> 07:30.200]  Which is what? Uh, hold on a second. I'll have to look it up. It's, uh. I have crickets. I just
[07:30.200 --> 07:35.360]  got crickets. Ooh, I got a three-starred opulent small grouper. Dang, that's pretty cool. Oh,
[07:35.360 --> 07:40.640]  wolves. Ah, shit. I have something, I have minnows selected right now. Oh. And I find that
[07:40.640 --> 07:48.720]  the minnows, I seem to have more luck if I'm, uh, reeling in. Whereas some other ones, like worms,
[07:48.720 --> 07:50.920]  seem totally fine just to sit out there. Yeah.
[07:53.740 --> 07:58.340]  I think there might be a big fish out there. I feel like I saw a big wake. It's possible.
[07:59.480 --> 08:03.300]  It's a big ocean. I caught a fucking big-ass hammerhead shark the other day. Oh,
[08:03.320 --> 08:07.000]  if you go into the museum, or not the museum, well, it's like a fish museum. The aquarium.
[08:09.980 --> 08:15.500]  I think there's one in, uh, I think there's one in there. Uh, so after you catch some fish,
[08:15.500 --> 08:19.700]  you just go to, like, the bait and sell thing. Yeah, you just go right here to sell and bait.
[08:19.980 --> 08:23.700]  Yeah. And then you, you get the money, you go back to town, you buy stuff,
[08:23.740 --> 08:28.520]  and then you come back, huh? Yeah. Cool. Nick's got something on the line. I got something. Come
[08:28.520 --> 08:34.240]  on, baby. Come on. Got a huge rainbow trout, baby. What is this? Nice. And I'm level three.
[08:34.380 --> 08:39.200]  A flounder. I guess I'm level, my three, four? Oh, ranked up to level four. That's fun.
[08:40.780 --> 08:45.960]  I can't reel in, the red bar keeps getting me. You can change your, as you level up,
[08:46.020 --> 08:49.020]  you can change your title and stuff, too. Like, you guys are scouts, and I'm a dude.
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.700]  That's neat. We're scouts. That'll help me fish better. Like, that's, uh, like boy scouts,
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.940]  or like scouts for the military. Yeah, we're scouts for the military, Nick. Yeah.
[09:01.700 --> 09:07.460]  Well, the ocean's clear, fellas. Nick, we got the same pool. Hey. Oh, I got something. Oh,
[09:07.460 --> 09:13.580]  nice. My line's just kind of hanging out there. Should I pull it in again? What do I do? Should I
[09:13.580 --> 09:20.100]  wait? Geoff! Yeah, I think if you're not getting any bites, you might as well pull it straight in.
[09:20.120 --> 09:28.000]  I got a small shrimp! Very little guy. Ah! I hit the mushroom! I went fishing in real life once,
[09:28.020 --> 09:31.780]  and it was a freaking calamity. Yeah? Really? Did you catch anything? It's never as fun as
[09:31.780 --> 09:36.860]  video game fishing. No. Deep sea fishing was really cool. I like deep sea fishing. There's
[09:36.860 --> 09:41.920]  a lot of smells involved with fishing. I caught one fish, and then the hook got stuck through his
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.120]  eye, and it was a bloody... Oh, God! What a way to go out, man. What a way to go out. Yeah, that sucks.
[09:47.360 --> 09:52.280]  Not letting that one back in the water. Man, all I'm getting is clownfish. I'm just fishing nemos.
[09:52.860 --> 09:57.760]  Well, they know it's you. I'm out of bait. Where do I get more bait? The selling bait place right
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.860]  there? Like the little hut? Got it. Or like, I'm sorry, like the little hole? Oh, thank you. Yeah.
[10:02.420 --> 10:11.020]  Oh, wow. Instant. Hell, yeah. What do we got here? The hell? A new creature. You caught a drink ring.
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.860]  What? Oh, yeah. You can sometimes catch trash. Oh, gosh. Come on, you moron. Catch the fish, you idiot.
[10:18.820 --> 10:25.360]  What do I got? Two stars. Let's see. Oh, a perch. God damn it. I keep drowning myself.
[10:27.420 --> 10:33.000]  Nick, please. Come on, man. Get family. I know. I got a glistening large shrimp. I think I'm out here fishing.
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.360]  Gotta feed them. I wonder how much. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. There was something really big in the water
[10:37.360 --> 10:41.560]  just now. Did you see that, Andrew? That's what I was talking about. I thought I saw like a wake.
[10:42.220 --> 10:45.120]  Yeah, there's a big game fishing over here. Let me see. Let me get over here. Let me get in on
[10:45.120 --> 10:49.460]  this action. I want to get in some of this. Point me in the direction. It was over by Andrew,
[10:49.560 --> 10:52.420]  just like straight out that way. It was just a really big wake that like cut through the water.
[10:52.420 --> 10:58.820]  Oh, wow. You can free cam. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes. It's H.
[11:00.660 --> 11:07.140]  I'm getting angles, son. Oh, I got drink rings. Yeah, I got those two. Hell yeah.
[11:07.760 --> 11:10.620]  That's what made the wake. Oh, amazing. I don't think so.
[11:11.720 --> 11:17.240]  Six pack of sarsaparilla. A new creature. Sarsaparilla. Oh, my little buddy caught something.
[11:18.720 --> 11:27.380]  Sarsaparilla. Sarsaparilla. Oh! Sipsaspara. Come on, man.
[11:29.720 --> 11:32.940]  Trying to get back up to a hundred bucks. I want to get some. I want to upgrade my uh,
[11:33.580 --> 11:38.720]  my reel and stuff. I'll take you guys to the fun store. Oh, shit. Okay. It's down the road a bit.
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.080]  Fun store. Oh, fuck. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Adult video megaplex?
[11:42.520 --> 11:45.000]  Dude, check it out. Just me and Nick. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[11:45.900 --> 11:49.260]  Ah, damn it. Your guy is looking at me out of the corner of his eye.
[11:50.440 --> 11:57.880]  What the fuck, Geoff? Oh, my God. Jesus Christ. I got one. That's awesome, Geoff. Holy. That's the
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.020]  first one of these I caught. Oh, my God. Oh, hell yeah. What'll happen to the rest of Nemo's class?
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.720]  A herring. I'm catching shit. Oh, that was immediate. What do I got? Hey, hey,
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.160]  Gavin, was it red? Was it red? A red herring.
[12:16.760 --> 12:24.960]  What the fuck, Geoff? Holy shit. Geoff. Andrew, what'd you get? There's some big shit out here.
[12:25.060 --> 12:27.960]  That's pretty cool. Oh, I'm getting her fucking drink rings.
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.300]  Well, it's a team effort, you know. I wouldn't even be over here if it weren't for Andrew.
[12:34.420 --> 12:38.760]  What'd you get, Nick? I got a large Atlantic salmon, but it's tiny. Was it red?
[12:47.260 --> 12:50.840]  There you go, Andrew. What do you got? What do you got? Oh, it's going to be a baby thing. It's
[12:50.840 --> 12:55.780]  going to be... it's only two clicks. It's going to be a little baby. Sometimes you're surprised.
[12:56.600 --> 13:01.820]  Way to go, Nick. I got an oyster. I always got confused between herring and herring.
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.420]  Way to go, Nick. A red herring? Oh, a herring? A bird? Herring and herring. Classic red herring.
[13:11.160 --> 13:18.940]  Oh, I have no bait. Oh, yeah. It doesn't do a good job of telling you when you don't have bait.
[13:19.080 --> 13:23.000]  No. It'll tell you in like the chat on the left, but if you don't see that here.
[13:23.340 --> 13:28.000]  Now, here we go. Me and Gavin. Reeling them in. Clicking, boys.
[13:28.700 --> 13:32.000]  Both at the same time. Maybe... what if you guys got the same fish?
[13:32.140 --> 13:33.760]  That'd be cool. They're kissing. That'd be awesome.
[13:34.940 --> 13:39.980]  Holy shit. I got a small swordfish. God damn it. I got a treasure chest.
[13:40.200 --> 13:43.440]  Oh, that's awesome. Oh, cool, dude. You can open that up. It'll have clothes in it.
[13:43.440 --> 13:46.180]  Yeah, that's how I got like... I got like a hoodie that way, I think.
[13:46.380 --> 13:50.420]  How do I open my treasure? You go to your bag and then you can click on it, I think.
[13:50.800 --> 13:54.580]  Yeah, just put it in your quick box. Oh, I got a huge blue fish.
[13:56.620 --> 13:59.720]  It's a fish that's blue. It's starting to see my bat out.
[13:59.720 --> 14:02.060]  Oh, what is this? $12.
[14:04.780 --> 14:09.620]  What'd you get? You got $12? He just fished it out of the sea. It's crazy.
[14:10.220 --> 14:13.340]  It just gave you $12. Nothing else. No, it says it's worth $12. I'm gonna open it now.
[14:13.580 --> 14:16.200]  Oh, okay. There's the equivalent of...
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.100]  How do I pay for upgrades? You have to go back to the town,
[14:20.240 --> 14:26.720]  go into the hub, and then there's a guy that has like a fish beard next to a scary looking possum
[14:26.720 --> 14:27.420]  woman. Okay.
[14:27.420 --> 14:30.460]  He's a giant frog. You can't miss him. Giant frog.
[14:31.060 --> 14:34.280]  Dude, I unlocked pissed off face. Oh, cool.
[14:34.540 --> 14:36.900]  I'm angry. Yeah, I knew it's you. It's cool.
[14:38.020 --> 14:39.820]  Oh, this is gonna be a good fish. What am I getting?
[14:41.580 --> 14:44.800]  Come on. A glistening lion. Oh, here we go.
[14:46.420 --> 14:49.280]  Well, we ain't calling you a truther. Oh, lord.
[14:51.600 --> 14:53.120]  Woof. Oh, wow.
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.540]  Oh, yeah. I caught a shrimp.
[14:57.740 --> 15:00.020]  A shrimp? I love shrimp.
[15:00.020 --> 15:01.000]  Got him, baby. They're delicious.
[15:01.140 --> 15:06.320]  Do you guys wanna take off in about a few more casts and go down and spend some of this money?
[15:06.500 --> 15:09.560]  Yeah, I'd love to. Yeah, whenever you guys are ready.
[15:09.640 --> 15:11.840]  I'm down. I've got 100 bucks.
[15:12.160 --> 15:14.760]  I have 200. I'm gonna catch one more and then I'll be ready to go.
[15:15.100 --> 15:17.260]  I wish I could give you guys a little bit of money, but...
[15:17.260 --> 15:20.100]  Yeah, it sucks. I just upgraded my rod, so I'm coming back.
[15:21.500 --> 15:24.760]  Me and Gavin doing a crisscross. It's pretty cool.
[15:24.940 --> 15:26.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:26.400 --> 15:27.960]  Is a seahorse worth a lot of money?
[15:28.800 --> 15:29.200]  Is the what?
[15:29.820 --> 15:31.140]  A seahorse worth a lot of money?
[15:31.900 --> 15:33.020]  No. Oh.
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.120]  I have no idea.
[15:34.660 --> 15:35.420]  I don't know.
[15:37.120 --> 15:38.200]  The seahorse racing.
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.920]  At some point, it'll matter how many stars it is. That's where you get, like, the value.
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.300]  There should be.
[15:46.440 --> 15:47.180]  Come on.
[15:47.540 --> 15:48.080]  Ooh, what are you?
[15:48.460 --> 15:48.780]  Nothing.
[15:48.780 --> 15:50.220]  Shining large bluefish.
[15:50.300 --> 15:50.640]  Nice.
[15:52.040 --> 15:52.400]  Nothing.
[15:57.760 --> 15:58.560]  Whoa, shit.
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.980]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[16:01.780 --> 16:02.280]  Yeah, I got it.
[16:02.380 --> 16:02.440]  Tiny Koi.
[16:03.480 --> 16:04.560]  Oh, the music came on.
[16:05.160 --> 16:07.600]  Yeah, sometimes the music stops and then starts again.
[16:07.860 --> 16:08.040]  Oh, right.
[16:08.180 --> 16:08.580]  Very weird.
[16:08.900 --> 16:11.300]  I think this video game was made by one dude.
[16:12.740 --> 16:13.100]  No.
[16:13.440 --> 16:14.720]  Yes, he seems to think it.
[16:15.180 --> 16:16.160]  I think maybe, yeah.
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.460]  I feel like Barb said something like that.
[16:17.540 --> 16:19.500]  He went, oh, what's my favorite part of Animal Crossing?
[16:19.660 --> 16:20.300]  Oh, I got that.
[16:20.540 --> 16:20.700]  Cool.
[16:21.560 --> 16:21.920]  Octopus!
[16:21.920 --> 16:22.940]  Cool octopus.
[16:23.220 --> 16:23.580]  Nice.
[16:23.740 --> 16:25.060]  And I got a Skrill.
[16:26.940 --> 16:29.960]  There's nothing hidden on the shore, on the land here.
[16:30.120 --> 16:31.740]  All right, boys, I'm ready to go to town.
[16:32.020 --> 16:33.040]  All right, let's go back to town.
[16:33.800 --> 16:36.960]  This game is a lot more fun when you're not mashing when you're not supposed to.
[16:37.180 --> 16:38.380]  Yes, I agree.
[16:38.740 --> 16:39.660]  You mean when you catch stuff?
[16:40.100 --> 16:42.380]  So if you go in here to do your upgrades and stuff,
[16:42.440 --> 16:44.540]  don't forget to go over here to Pawprint Point.
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.860]  I guarantee you, you've got rewards you can pick up.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.200]  Oh, really?
[16:47.560 --> 16:48.220]  Oh, shit.
[16:48.380 --> 16:49.620]  You were right about that.
[16:50.000 --> 16:50.620]  Oh, dude.
[16:51.060 --> 16:51.420]  Bunts.
[16:51.940 --> 16:53.820]  Yeah, you Bunts haul pretty good.
[16:53.860 --> 16:57.060]  Claim reward, claim reward, claim reward, claim reward, claim reward.
[16:57.280 --> 16:58.500]  Wow, I got a lot of money.
[16:59.820 --> 17:00.260]  Good lord.
[17:00.260 --> 17:01.520]  I had no money, now I have money.
[17:01.660 --> 17:02.180]  This is cool.
[17:02.700 --> 17:03.500]  Do I want to go hub?
[17:05.380 --> 17:12.060]  So if you guys want to spend that money, can I fucking find this thing, please?
[17:12.920 --> 17:14.240]  Oh, I can unlock crickets.
[17:14.500 --> 17:14.920]  Do I want that?
[17:15.140 --> 17:15.220]  No.
[17:15.360 --> 17:17.900]  I did that, but it costs money when you need to refill them.
[17:18.140 --> 17:18.780]  Small Marlin.
[17:19.220 --> 17:20.960]  So just a heads up.
[17:22.520 --> 17:24.560]  Oh, I want to increase my rod luck.
[17:24.920 --> 17:28.780]  And then there's, I can take you guys to where the fun store is, where you can buy other stuff.
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.840]  Go to the fun store in a second.
[17:30.940 --> 17:33.440]  Just before you make your purchases.
[17:34.720 --> 17:36.720]  I'm upgrading my rod chance and all this shit.
[17:36.780 --> 17:37.540]  I'm going crazy mode.
[17:37.640 --> 17:38.860]  I got to do some of this stuff.
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.140]  Yeah, I upgraded a couple things.
[17:40.740 --> 17:43.880]  I've never bought anything from the vending machine, but it all looks pretty good.
[17:44.020 --> 17:47.060]  It's like sodas that give you timed boosts and stuff.
[17:49.920 --> 17:50.820]  Oh, what's this?
[17:50.820 --> 17:52.420]  Oh, I can get some new shit.
[17:52.540 --> 17:53.880]  Do you like my new mouth?
[17:55.080 --> 17:56.040]  Oh, do you have a new mouth?
[17:56.260 --> 17:57.320]  Super bounce brew.
[17:57.480 --> 17:58.360]  Oh, nice mouth.
[17:58.580 --> 17:59.000]  Oh, wow.
[17:59.080 --> 18:00.100]  I actually really like that.
[18:00.140 --> 18:00.720]  That's really cool.
[18:00.840 --> 18:01.180]  Thank you.
[18:01.660 --> 18:02.420]  You're like...
[18:02.420 --> 18:02.600]  You're spooky.
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.640]  What made you pick those colors?
[18:05.380 --> 18:06.620]  Uh, I love these colors.
[18:06.920 --> 18:07.400]  Oh, wow.
[18:07.520 --> 18:07.960]  That is cool.
[18:08.120 --> 18:10.520]  Andrew hasn't changed his guy at all.
[18:11.660 --> 18:13.360]  Andrew's just good.
[18:13.500 --> 18:14.580]  I'm just ready to go.
[18:15.220 --> 18:17.140]  I want to save up for my leech license.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.220]  That's what I'm working for.
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.660]  I just changed my title.
[18:22.480 --> 18:24.760]  That shit gets so expensive, by the way.
[18:25.240 --> 18:25.560]  Uh...
[18:25.560 --> 18:26.100]  Are you a critter?
[18:26.260 --> 18:28.520]  Oh, Nick's already down at the other store.
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.360]  Guys, I...
[18:29.360 --> 18:29.500]  What?
[18:29.740 --> 18:30.040]  Uh-oh.
[18:30.320 --> 18:30.600]  I am?
[18:31.900 --> 18:32.460]  What's wrong, Andrew?
[18:32.640 --> 18:36.200]  I hit the mushroom and it sent me way across the map.
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.240]  No, mushrooms will do that.
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.160]  Oh, no.
[18:39.400 --> 18:39.800]  Oh, no.
[18:40.480 --> 18:41.880]  We can't cross here.
[18:42.080 --> 18:42.700]  Oh, there we go.
[18:42.800 --> 18:43.720]  Oh, how'd you get over there?
[18:43.860 --> 18:44.460]  I just dived.
[18:45.620 --> 18:47.120]  Shit, I can't get around this.
[18:51.040 --> 18:52.180]  What is this?
[18:52.360 --> 18:53.660]  Is there a sprint button?
[18:54.420 --> 18:54.860]  Yeah, shift.
[18:55.400 --> 18:55.520]  Shift.
[18:56.520 --> 18:57.720]  The universal sprint.
[18:58.780 --> 19:00.620]  Whoa, I've landed on this ledge.
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.980]  Can you fish here?
[19:05.700 --> 19:07.740]  Yeah, I think anywhere there's water you can.
[19:07.740 --> 19:09.040]  Is this the shop, Geoff?
[19:09.180 --> 19:10.200]  Over here by the pier?
[19:10.420 --> 19:11.260]  I got a problem.
[19:11.380 --> 19:11.480]  Yeah.
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.020]  I'm watching Geoff drown himself.
[19:13.680 --> 19:14.160]  I can't do it.
[19:14.160 --> 19:14.820]  I can't...
[19:14.820 --> 19:16.020]  Geoff, help.
[19:16.160 --> 19:16.660]  Yeah, what's up?
[19:16.760 --> 19:17.200]  Geoff, help.
[19:17.740 --> 19:18.000]  What?
[19:18.040 --> 19:18.880]  I don't know where you are.
[19:19.080 --> 19:19.680]  I'm on the beach.
[19:19.920 --> 19:20.080]  What's your problem?
[19:20.080 --> 19:21.220]  I'm next to you.
[19:22.980 --> 19:23.860]  Oh, uh...
[19:23.860 --> 19:24.000]  Help.
[19:24.680 --> 19:26.120]  I don't know how to help you.
[19:26.180 --> 19:27.520]  Help, fish me out.
[19:28.480 --> 19:29.520]  Use your line.
[19:30.760 --> 19:31.740]  Fish me out.
[19:31.780 --> 19:32.400]  I'm stuck.
[19:33.080 --> 19:34.240]  What the fuck?
[19:34.360 --> 19:35.380]  I'm stuck, Geoff.
[19:35.440 --> 19:36.400]  Help me, fish me.
[19:36.480 --> 19:37.240]  Fish me out.
[19:37.700 --> 19:40.360]  Guys, I caught a new creature in the woods.
[19:40.760 --> 19:41.300]  Is it me?
[19:41.820 --> 19:42.580]  It's a spectral...
[19:42.580 --> 19:44.260]  It's a spectral rib.
[19:45.100 --> 19:45.800]  Oh, you got it.
[19:45.980 --> 19:49.240]  Yeah, if you get five rib pieces, you get the spectral fishbowl.
[19:49.240 --> 19:50.860]  I can't seem to catch you.
[19:51.020 --> 19:51.820]  Oh, no, I'm trying.
[19:51.920 --> 19:52.600]  I'm trying to grab it.
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.480]  I'm trying to grab it.
[19:53.660 --> 19:54.900]  Are you stuck in the water?
[19:55.080 --> 19:56.240]  I'm stuck in the water.
[19:56.520 --> 19:57.520]  How did I see you?
[19:57.960 --> 19:58.920]  I'm doing a little spins.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.460]  Can you jump and die?
[20:02.880 --> 20:04.060]  Oh, oh, oh, I can.
[20:04.820 --> 20:05.440]  Okay, I'm out.
[20:05.520 --> 20:06.180]  Yeah, there you go.
[20:06.560 --> 20:07.880]  Oh, no, I'm stuck in a tree.
[20:08.300 --> 20:10.320]  Hey, Nick, where was that spectral bone or whatever?
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.680]  It's up there on that ledge.
[20:13.600 --> 20:13.820]  Where?
[20:14.020 --> 20:14.780]  Like where I'm looking.
[20:14.880 --> 20:15.840]  It's up there by that tree.
[20:16.320 --> 20:16.900]  I can show you.
[20:16.980 --> 20:17.800]  Do I fish up there?
[20:17.940 --> 20:19.220]  I had to...
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.940]  I jumped on a mushroom and I launched up there.
[20:22.500 --> 20:22.660]  Got it.
[20:23.040 --> 20:23.480]  Got it.
[20:23.540 --> 20:24.020]  Now I understand.
[20:24.100 --> 20:25.240]  I think it was this mushroom over here.
[20:25.420 --> 20:27.120]  If you want to come over here, Eric, it's right here.
[20:27.280 --> 20:27.680]  I can show you.
[20:27.680 --> 20:27.920]  Cool.
[20:28.540 --> 20:29.700]  So I just jump on this thing?
[20:29.840 --> 20:30.300]  The blue one.
[20:30.540 --> 20:31.360]  I fell down, but yeah.
[20:31.680 --> 20:31.880]  This one.
[20:32.640 --> 20:33.760]  Just face that way and everything?
[20:33.760 --> 20:34.000]  Yeah.
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.720]  God, I hate the camera on this.
[20:35.820 --> 20:35.960]  Yeah.
[20:36.040 --> 20:36.500]  Just hate it.
[20:36.540 --> 20:37.120]  Pull me up.
[20:37.400 --> 20:38.080]  Grab on, Andrew.
[20:38.280 --> 20:39.080]  And pull me up.
[20:41.560 --> 20:41.880]  Oh!
[20:49.580 --> 20:52.980]  I think I'm mostly fishing the sand.
[20:54.280 --> 20:56.840]  Oh yeah, you're definitely in the sand over there.
[20:57.720 --> 21:00.220]  Yeah, I just have to face the right way.
[21:00.340 --> 21:00.560]  What you getting?
[21:00.980 --> 21:01.940]  You'll go, you'll go.
[21:02.120 --> 21:04.080]  It's just, I just, the camera's just miserable.
[21:06.080 --> 21:06.660]  Give it.
[21:07.040 --> 21:07.500]  Give it.
[21:07.780 --> 21:08.280]  Missed it.
[21:08.740 --> 21:08.920]  Missed it.
[21:09.580 --> 21:10.300]  Oh, nice.
[21:10.740 --> 21:11.780]  I got a walleye.
[21:12.140 --> 21:12.880]  Oh, looks great.
[21:13.040 --> 21:13.300]  God, he's a trollzer.
[21:13.720 --> 21:13.900]  Damn.
[21:13.900 --> 21:16.560]  Oh, you get fragments to buy this shit?
[21:17.420 --> 21:19.060]  Yeah, I don't know what to do about that.
[21:19.060 --> 21:20.940]  I haven't seen any of the fragments yet.
[21:22.280 --> 21:23.480]  I've caught hundreds of fish.
[21:24.040 --> 21:25.940]  Oh, you're on the...
[21:25.940 --> 21:26.800]  Oh, this is great.
[21:27.980 --> 21:29.260]  I found a scratch off.
[21:29.440 --> 21:30.240]  Or I bought a scratch off.
[21:30.320 --> 21:30.840]  Oh, you bought one?
[21:30.900 --> 21:31.240]  What happened?
[21:31.360 --> 21:31.900]  I haven't bought one yet.
[21:31.900 --> 21:32.900]  I'll tell you as soon as I use it.
[21:32.960 --> 21:33.480]  There you go.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.040]  He's right here.
[21:34.060 --> 21:34.220]  See?
[21:34.680 --> 21:34.880]  Yep.
[21:35.120 --> 21:35.400]  Got it.
[21:35.460 --> 21:35.640]  All right.
[21:35.700 --> 21:39.720]  So you just get five of those and then you go behind the waterfall and there's a place to buy it.
[21:39.820 --> 21:41.060]  How do I do it?
[21:41.180 --> 21:41.320]  Me.
[21:41.520 --> 21:42.040]  Oh, here we go.
[21:42.980 --> 21:43.500]  I'm watching.
[21:45.160 --> 21:45.960]  I'm just...
[21:45.960 --> 21:47.300]  It's just like a regular scratch off.
[21:47.640 --> 21:51.200]  You equip it and then you rub it with the mouse.
[21:51.700 --> 21:52.100]  Okay.
[21:53.940 --> 21:54.880]  And let's see.
[21:56.660 --> 21:57.540]  I didn't win shit.
[21:57.980 --> 21:58.740]  Are you serious?
[21:58.880 --> 21:59.960]  Yeah, I didn't win anything.
[22:00.620 --> 22:01.380]  Oh, my guy's mad.
[22:01.520 --> 22:02.340]  Oh, so realistic.
[22:02.540 --> 22:04.160]  Oh, a scratch off is 25 bucks?
[22:04.260 --> 22:04.420]  Yeah.
[22:04.460 --> 22:05.020]  That's pretty cool.
[22:05.420 --> 22:06.780]  You can get a $75 later.
[22:07.440 --> 22:07.680]  Nice.
[22:07.680 --> 22:08.580]  Are you guys gambling?
[22:09.140 --> 22:09.760]  Yeah, baby.
[22:10.100 --> 22:11.880]  This is where you can buy the metal detector.
[22:11.880 --> 22:15.080]  If you wanted to get a royalty-free boombox.
[22:15.460 --> 22:16.320]  Oh, it's a watch.
[22:16.420 --> 22:16.960]  I thought it was a gun.
[22:16.960 --> 22:18.320]  There's a green screen you can buy.
[22:19.080 --> 22:21.100]  Fart balloon, $500.
[22:21.580 --> 22:23.400]  There's no way I'm paying 500 bucks for a fart balloon yet.
[22:23.540 --> 22:24.020]  Not yet.
[22:24.440 --> 22:25.460]  Top hat fragments.
[22:27.200 --> 22:28.280]  Therapy seat prop.
[22:28.520 --> 22:29.040]  Make a load off.
[22:29.140 --> 22:30.100]  Oh, man, I didn't win.
[22:30.420 --> 22:32.040]  I'm gonna buy a scratch off.
[22:33.620 --> 22:34.460]  I'm mad that I didn't win.
[22:34.620 --> 22:36.760]  I've had a lot of success fishing off this pier.
[22:37.920 --> 22:39.220]  It looks like a good fishing spot.
[22:39.320 --> 22:40.420]  It's a nice fishing spot.
[22:43.060 --> 22:44.700]  I like the music when it comes in.
[22:44.780 --> 22:45.200]  It's really nice.
[22:45.300 --> 22:46.020]  Yeah, it's real peaceful.
[22:46.760 --> 22:47.440]  Scratch it off.
[22:48.260 --> 22:51.440]  Eric, when you went fishing, were you fishing in California or here?
[22:52.060 --> 22:52.380]  California.
[22:52.700 --> 22:56.520]  You just go like, you go down kind of like towards Mexico and all that.
[22:56.940 --> 22:58.800]  Do I just scratch the whole thing?
[22:58.880 --> 22:59.200]  What am I doing?
[22:59.680 --> 23:00.600]  Yeah, you gotta keep scratching.
[23:00.840 --> 23:01.720]  It'll tell you if you win.
[23:01.780 --> 23:02.440]  You gotta scratch all the way.
[23:02.640 --> 23:03.800]  You just have to reveal all the numbers.
[23:04.000 --> 23:04.780]  Wow, that's pretty cool, Geoff.
[23:04.840 --> 23:05.420]  That's cool.
[23:05.900 --> 23:07.560]  I can't figure out where you guys are.
[23:08.100 --> 23:09.120]  On the dock.
[23:09.480 --> 23:10.640]  I didn't win or a dick.
[23:10.640 --> 23:12.540]  So I'm going to go back and buy another one.
[23:12.920 --> 23:18.580]  There's also a place I found called The Void that I went into where everything was black
[23:18.580 --> 23:20.380]  and you just fish into the black.
[23:20.820 --> 23:22.560]  And that was weird for a while.
[23:22.760 --> 23:25.080]  And I don't know how to get back to it, but I had something to do with the lighthouse.
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.980]  You crossed the bridge, Gavin?
[23:28.400 --> 23:29.380]  Did I do what?
[23:30.100 --> 23:30.820]  Never mind.
[23:31.040 --> 23:31.800]  Fine, I found you.
[23:34.950 --> 23:36.290]  Come on, give me a bite.
[23:37.010 --> 23:41.050]  That's a pretty cool big eel thing.
[23:42.190 --> 23:48.350]  Oh, I want to win 50 bucks so bad that I can buy more scratchies.
[23:49.810 --> 23:51.730]  Come on, give me a bite.
[23:52.150 --> 23:56.790]  Have you ever come up with a password so good you were disappointed you couldn't tell anyone about it?
[23:58.530 --> 23:59.030]  No.
[24:00.030 --> 24:00.530]  No.
[24:02.350 --> 24:03.410]  Uh, yeah.
[24:03.850 --> 24:05.310]  Yeah, it's disappointing, right?
[24:05.550 --> 24:06.750]  You're like, this is my finest work.
[24:06.790 --> 24:09.290]  And if I tell anyone, my banking information's boned.
[24:09.290 --> 24:13.110]  I had a password that I had to give somebody eventually.
[24:13.330 --> 24:15.590]  I was like, I was like a webmaster for them.
[24:16.170 --> 24:20.290]  And the password for them was kind of making fun of them, but it was also really good.
[24:20.870 --> 24:23.870]  And I had to give it to them when they took over their website again.
[24:23.970 --> 24:27.090]  And they were like, that's kind of mean, but that's like the best password ever.
[24:27.690 --> 24:28.050]  Damn.
[24:29.850 --> 24:31.130]  So I still use it.
[24:32.750 --> 24:35.950]  Did I tell you guys about when I worked in IT and there was a CEO
[24:35.950 --> 24:40.150]  who wanted the password for his server to be outside of what our best practices are?
[24:40.410 --> 24:41.430]  Did I ever tell you about that?
[24:41.570 --> 24:41.790]  No.
[24:43.110 --> 24:45.110]  He was like, okay, so we got like this.
[24:45.210 --> 24:47.430]  And we were like, okay, we got like your server set up for your business.
[24:47.490 --> 24:48.830]  Like, is that his business server?
[24:49.850 --> 24:51.610]  And we're like, what password do you want?
[24:51.650 --> 24:52.570]  And he went, oh, pizza.
[24:53.390 --> 24:56.450]  And we went, oh, I mean, that doesn't fit our best.
[24:56.510 --> 25:00.170]  We got to have like letters, numbers, a couple like symbols, stuff like that, whatever.
[25:00.450 --> 25:03.130]  And he went, it's, listen, it's my server.
[25:03.330 --> 25:04.230]  I'm paying for it.
[25:04.350 --> 25:05.730]  I want the password to be pizza.
[25:05.950 --> 25:11.710]  All lowercase pizza was the password for an entire company server.
[25:12.910 --> 25:13.550]  Insane.
[25:14.010 --> 25:14.650]  Insane.
[25:14.690 --> 25:16.010]  I think about that all the time.
[25:16.390 --> 25:17.370]  All the time.
[25:17.850 --> 25:19.790]  Pizza, all lowercase.
[25:20.110 --> 25:20.370]  Incredible.
[25:22.590 --> 25:24.570]  I don't even know what to start.
[25:25.250 --> 25:26.350]  So crazy.
[25:26.910 --> 25:28.250]  It's my server.
[25:28.430 --> 25:28.790]  Yeah, right.
[25:28.850 --> 25:30.330]  And you're paying us to protect it.
[25:30.610 --> 25:30.950]  Pizza.
[25:31.250 --> 25:32.350]  What was this guy like?
[25:32.390 --> 25:32.990]  Was he fun?
[25:33.670 --> 25:34.270]  No.
[25:34.930 --> 25:37.130]  Did he like, did he really like pizza a lot?
[25:37.850 --> 25:38.870]  It did not.
[25:39.090 --> 25:40.630]  It didn't seem like it.
[25:40.690 --> 25:42.150]  I won on the scratcher.
[25:42.150 --> 25:43.030]  I got a double win.
[25:45.230 --> 25:46.030]  35 bucks.
[25:47.750 --> 25:48.770]  Way to go, dude.
[25:48.870 --> 25:52.590]  I spent 180 on scratchers, but hey, it's a start.
[25:54.330 --> 25:56.070]  180 dollars to buy a metal detector.
[25:56.190 --> 25:57.190]  You can get some treasure.
[25:57.530 --> 25:59.350]  You know, it's gonna be a long distance catch.
[25:59.690 --> 26:00.190]  Come on, son.
[26:00.630 --> 26:01.390]  Come on, son.
[26:01.390 --> 26:02.450]  Pulled in.
[26:02.770 --> 26:05.530]  That guy was a burger guy and he was trying to throw him off the scent.
[26:05.710 --> 26:07.030]  Oh, that's probably, probably right.
[26:07.210 --> 26:09.550]  They know I'm gluten intolerant.
[26:09.650 --> 26:10.750]  I'd never pick pizza.
[26:12.490 --> 26:12.970]  Grouper.
[26:13.930 --> 26:14.930]  Where is Gavin?
[26:17.110 --> 26:17.730]  Can you not see me?
[26:17.910 --> 26:17.990]  Where is Gavin?
[26:18.570 --> 26:20.070]  I'm doing long distance fishing.
[26:20.810 --> 26:21.710]  Long distance?
[26:22.710 --> 26:23.430]  From where?
[26:25.610 --> 26:27.810]  Are you up on like a hill?
[26:28.450 --> 26:29.010]  I'm on the lighthouse.
[26:29.870 --> 26:30.510]  Are you?
[26:31.430 --> 26:32.630]  I did that the other day.
[26:32.650 --> 26:33.390]  Just see if you could.
[26:33.550 --> 26:34.210]  Yeah, I was surprised.
[26:34.490 --> 26:35.070]  It's a long way down.
[26:35.550 --> 26:39.570]  I think when you drop down, the only way to get down from the lighthouse, I think, is to jump.
[26:39.890 --> 26:40.090]  Oh.
[26:40.310 --> 26:44.970]  And I'm not positive, but I think that might be what opened up that portal in the ground for me.
[26:45.110 --> 26:45.870]  So keep your eyes peeled.
[26:45.970 --> 26:46.450]  Find out, Gavin.
[26:46.990 --> 26:47.630]  Killing yourself.
[26:47.890 --> 26:48.690]  You find the void.
[26:48.950 --> 26:49.390]  You see me?
[26:49.530 --> 26:53.070]  No, I can't see the lighthouse from here.
[26:53.230 --> 26:53.710]  Yeah, I can't either.
[26:54.130 --> 26:54.290]  Oh.
[26:54.790 --> 26:55.510]  It's a long way away.
[26:55.530 --> 26:56.230]  I'll go over there, though.
[26:56.610 --> 26:57.050]  Can we head that way?
[26:58.110 --> 26:58.510]  I'll follow you.
[26:58.510 --> 26:59.630]  Tractors aren't looking good.
[26:59.810 --> 27:01.330]  You can also just free cam and fly around.
[27:01.830 --> 27:03.230]  I'm going back to town.
[27:03.670 --> 27:04.110]  Oh, I got something.
[27:04.730 --> 27:05.450]  Oh, shit.
[27:06.950 --> 27:07.390]  What'd you get?
[27:07.510 --> 27:07.730]  Six.
[27:08.070 --> 27:09.010]  Uh, I'll tell you in a second.
[27:09.170 --> 27:10.210]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[27:10.350 --> 27:11.570]  It sounds like Rain Man over there.
[27:12.770 --> 27:13.990]  He dropped toothpicks, bud.
[27:14.390 --> 27:14.730]  Wow.
[27:14.850 --> 27:17.030]  That was a lot to do for a large seahorse.
[27:17.410 --> 27:17.670]  All right.
[27:18.150 --> 27:18.510]  Awesome.
[27:21.350 --> 27:23.290]  Would a seahorse grab bait?
[27:24.570 --> 27:25.350]  No, I don't know.
[27:25.370 --> 27:25.810]  Can it?
[27:27.390 --> 27:27.650]  Oh.
[27:28.670 --> 27:29.330]  60 bucks.
[27:29.330 --> 27:29.850]  It'd have to be small.
[27:30.770 --> 27:31.170]  Nice.
[27:31.390 --> 27:32.810]  Okay, so I'm at 95.
[27:33.850 --> 27:34.570]  Halfway there.
[27:35.090 --> 27:35.790]  Making a profit.
[27:35.950 --> 27:36.410]  How many do I have?
[27:38.290 --> 27:39.090]  I have...
[27:39.090 --> 27:39.770]  Both of them.
[27:41.770 --> 27:42.590]  Which way's the lighthouse?
[27:42.690 --> 27:43.090]  We need...
[27:44.090 --> 27:45.470]  Uh, it's up to the...
[27:46.930 --> 27:51.150]  Like, take a left from, uh, where we're fishing and go all the way to the other side.
[27:51.370 --> 27:51.650]  Okay.
[27:52.210 --> 27:53.630]  Man, I'm like the sniper of fishes.
[27:55.010 --> 27:55.850]  Hey, is that...
[27:55.850 --> 27:56.610]  Is that good?
[27:57.030 --> 27:57.450]  I don't know.
[27:57.450 --> 27:58.650]  I'm not getting a lot of fish.
[27:58.710 --> 27:59.210]  Got one.
[28:00.190 --> 28:01.070]  He's just killing them.
[28:01.270 --> 28:01.670]  What's up, dude?
[28:01.810 --> 28:02.990]  Hey, what's up, Geoff?
[28:03.530 --> 28:04.150]  Me and you, Nick.
[28:04.650 --> 28:05.150]  Hey, man.
[28:06.190 --> 28:06.510]  Let's see.
[28:06.750 --> 28:09.090]  You wanna snipe some fish?
[28:09.970 --> 28:10.290]  Yeah.
[28:14.010 --> 28:14.330]  Dude.
[28:14.470 --> 28:16.270]  Oh, do you think we could land on the rock in the middle?
[28:17.030 --> 28:17.850]  And then what?
[28:18.150 --> 28:18.650]  And we fish.
[28:19.330 --> 28:23.530]  Can you imagine, Geoff, if in 2020-2012 we were like,
[28:23.530 --> 28:27.230]  I want to see a flash forward of the 2024 Fishing Jamboree.
[28:27.770 --> 28:32.750]  And it's you and me in the most dog shit looking game ever.
[28:35.830 --> 28:39.590]  It's like, is that Nick the fucking audio guy?
[28:43.450 --> 28:45.390]  Oh, I landed on it, Nick.
[28:45.630 --> 28:46.610]  Oh no, I fell off.
[28:46.710 --> 28:47.450]  Oh no.
[28:50.170 --> 28:51.970]  Hey, small shrimp.
[28:52.270 --> 28:52.890]  I like fishing.
[28:52.890 --> 28:54.450]  I guess the last one was my last bait.
[28:54.590 --> 28:56.190]  That's why I'm just sat here with my hook in the water.
[28:58.450 --> 28:58.990]  What's what?
[29:00.410 --> 29:03.710]  Well, if you jump down, I think it's the only way to get down.
[29:03.710 --> 29:04.310]  Hold on, hold on.
[29:04.470 --> 29:06.470]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[29:06.530 --> 29:07.250]  Are you on it?
[29:07.810 --> 29:08.130]  I'm on it.
[29:08.130 --> 29:08.350]  Oh, wow.
[29:08.470 --> 29:09.310]  I'm on it.
[29:09.490 --> 29:09.710]  Nice.
[29:11.290 --> 29:12.410]  All right, I'm gonna fish.
[29:12.910 --> 29:13.530]  Yeah, get fishing.
[29:14.550 --> 29:15.370]  I need a bait hole.
[29:15.510 --> 29:17.650]  Of course, the void will not be here now.
[29:17.750 --> 29:21.330]  And I'll be like, now I'll have to figure out what actually caused that thing to appear.
[29:21.550 --> 29:22.290]  Did you buy a boat?
[29:23.530 --> 29:24.850]  Uh, not that I'm aware of.
[29:25.270 --> 29:26.790]  All right, I'm putting more crickets on.
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.610]  I'm gonna do some cricket long range.
[29:29.030 --> 29:29.430]  Nice.
[29:30.530 --> 29:32.570]  Oh, you can jump up the lighthouse from the bottom?
[29:33.210 --> 29:33.590]  How?
[29:34.410 --> 29:35.450]  Oh, with the mushroom?
[29:35.810 --> 29:37.210]  Yeah, that shroom almost got me there.
[29:39.290 --> 29:39.690]  Close.
[29:40.930 --> 29:41.450]  Oh, shit.
[29:41.590 --> 29:42.030]  Fuck, shit.
[29:42.130 --> 29:42.770]  God damn it.
[29:42.770 --> 29:43.550]  I watched it.
[29:43.630 --> 29:44.750]  I watched you cast and nothing.
[29:46.990 --> 29:47.790]  How's it going, Andrew?
[29:48.010 --> 29:48.790]  I just...
[29:48.790 --> 29:50.530]  Scratch and wins did not pay out.
[29:50.710 --> 29:51.170]  We're not looking.
[29:51.690 --> 29:52.390]  Down 50.
[29:53.130 --> 29:53.890]  Oh, no.
[29:53.990 --> 29:55.030]  Only one way to get back even.
[29:55.290 --> 29:56.610]  Gambling wasn't worth it, is what you're saying.
[29:56.610 --> 29:57.570]  Just like real life.
[29:59.230 --> 30:02.190]  Well, I can't fucking see what I'm fishing there.
[30:02.590 --> 30:03.830]  This is really peaceful.
[30:04.470 --> 30:05.250]  All I see is grass.
[30:05.370 --> 30:06.170]  You're fishing...
[30:06.170 --> 30:06.650]  Worms.
[30:08.270 --> 30:09.630]  Oh, you got something immediately.
[30:09.750 --> 30:10.090]  Oh, wow.
[30:11.010 --> 30:12.790]  Holy shit, look at all the clicks on this.
[30:14.730 --> 30:15.910]  Good god damn, son.
[30:16.470 --> 30:17.050]  Better click hard.
[30:18.770 --> 30:19.130]  No!
[30:20.710 --> 30:21.590]  Don't blow it.
[30:21.590 --> 30:22.670]  Did you click hard?
[30:24.670 --> 30:26.330]  Hey, you got it, Gav.
[30:26.350 --> 30:26.770]  Jesus.
[30:27.490 --> 30:28.490]  It's a wolf fish.
[30:28.490 --> 30:28.630]  What was it?
[30:29.030 --> 30:29.950]  It's two meters long.
[30:31.750 --> 30:33.330]  Dude, that's a fucking...
[30:33.330 --> 30:34.470]  That's a lot of meters.
[30:34.810 --> 30:34.910]  Yeah.
[30:34.970 --> 30:36.070]  I got the...
[30:36.070 --> 30:37.510]  I got the six foot long fish.
[30:37.830 --> 30:41.070]  I got the lucky lure and it gives me money every time I do...
[30:41.450 --> 30:42.590]  Every time I catch something.
[30:42.690 --> 30:43.230]  That's awesome.
[30:44.010 --> 30:44.250]  Yeah.
[30:44.570 --> 30:45.410]  Oh, that's smart, dude.
[30:45.470 --> 30:50.010]  I only ever got the quick jig, which gains rod power or something.
[30:54.500 --> 30:55.740]  Oh, don't mess it up, you idiot.
[30:56.340 --> 30:57.700]  Don't mess it up, you stupid bastard.
[31:01.870 --> 31:02.150]  Whoa!
[31:02.950 --> 31:03.510]  Whoa, nice.
[31:04.050 --> 31:05.450]  Look at the size of this.
[31:06.250 --> 31:06.870]  What is that, dude?
[31:06.870 --> 31:07.630]  Is that a hammerhead shark?
[31:07.630 --> 31:08.330]  It's a hammerhead.
[31:08.970 --> 31:10.590]  Hell yeah, you'll make some money off that.
[31:10.910 --> 31:11.190]  Dude.
[31:11.990 --> 31:12.530]  Hi, Andrew.
[31:12.830 --> 31:13.030]  Hey.
[31:13.450 --> 31:15.670]  That hammerhead was swimming and now he's up the top of a lighthouse.
[31:17.630 --> 31:18.850]  Oh, I found a coin bag.
[31:19.570 --> 31:19.990]  He couldn't...
[31:19.990 --> 31:20.130]  What?
[31:20.230 --> 31:22.130]  Yeah, sometimes you'll pick one up when you get a good fish.
[31:22.170 --> 31:22.770]  You get a coin bag?
[31:22.870 --> 31:23.490]  I had a bit of luck.
[31:23.490 --> 31:23.830]  You just sell it.
[31:24.270 --> 31:25.270]  You don't open it or anything.
[31:25.270 --> 31:26.290]  It's not like a treasure chest.
[31:26.350 --> 31:27.790]  You just smell it or smell it.
[31:30.050 --> 31:32.450]  It just stinks and you smell it.
[31:32.510 --> 31:33.550]  Get away from that metal.
[31:34.830 --> 31:35.230]  Hey, what the?
[31:39.020 --> 31:41.380]  Hey, Gavin, I think there's a bone over here you can get if you want.
[31:41.920 --> 31:42.280]  A bone?
[31:42.300 --> 31:42.880]  Where are you?
[31:43.580 --> 31:44.900]  One of the spectral bones.
[31:45.240 --> 31:45.860]  Holy shit, Nick.
[31:46.480 --> 31:47.080]  Where are you?
[31:47.580 --> 31:49.320]  Are you on top of the lighthouse right now?
[31:49.480 --> 31:49.840]  Big time.
[31:50.080 --> 31:50.200]  Yeah.
[31:51.220 --> 31:52.020]  Fish sniping.
[31:54.740 --> 31:55.260]  They're fishing.
[31:55.460 --> 31:55.600]  Where's the bone?
[31:55.900 --> 31:56.560]  I'm scratching.
[31:57.320 --> 31:58.080]  Hold on a second.
[31:58.120 --> 31:58.760]  Let me...
[32:00.480 --> 32:01.760]  What is that?
[32:02.140 --> 32:02.800]  Holy cow.
[32:03.140 --> 32:03.860]  Manta ray, baby.
[32:04.080 --> 32:04.800]  Butterfly of the sea.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.300]  What is it, like six Bs?
[32:06.440 --> 32:07.080]  Holy shit.
[32:07.160 --> 32:07.920]  It was pretty big.
[32:08.880 --> 32:16.560]  So to get to the next bone, it's down here.
[32:17.700 --> 32:19.060]  Look at all these guys just hanging out.
[32:20.220 --> 32:22.040]  And there goes Geoff to his death.
[32:22.560 --> 32:23.580]  All right, what's this going to be?
[32:23.980 --> 32:24.660]  Give me something.
[32:25.260 --> 32:25.860]  Where are you, Geoff?
[32:26.260 --> 32:27.140]  I'm right over here.
[32:27.160 --> 32:28.200]  Whoa, Gavin.
[32:28.440 --> 32:29.880]  I would love to catch something.
[32:30.120 --> 32:30.580]  That's a huge swordfish.
[32:30.860 --> 32:32.180]  Hey, I'm trying to turn around.
[32:32.800 --> 32:33.780]  It's a marlin.
[32:33.820 --> 32:34.420]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[32:35.180 --> 32:35.780]  Oh, okay, cool.
[32:35.900 --> 32:36.540]  Like right at the front there.
[32:36.720 --> 32:37.180]  Okay, yep.
[32:37.980 --> 32:41.500]  So if you come over here, this one's the most annoying one to get, by the way.
[32:41.520 --> 32:42.180]  Okay, great.
[32:42.200 --> 32:43.420]  All the rest of them are super easy.
[32:43.700 --> 32:45.320]  Man, I got fish coming at my dick.
[32:45.800 --> 32:48.100]  If you come down here, you just have to jump.
[32:48.260 --> 32:49.220]  You have to platform over it.
[32:49.220 --> 32:49.900]  Oh, wow.
[32:49.900 --> 32:54.080]  It took me a good six or seven minutes to do it, but I'm sure everybody else will get it fast.
[32:54.900 --> 32:55.260]  Nope.
[32:55.260 --> 32:58.280]  You can't, in my estimation, you cannot slide.
[32:58.400 --> 32:59.800]  You gotta like hard brake as you jump.
[33:01.240 --> 33:02.020]  It felt real.
[33:02.140 --> 33:05.120]  It felt a lot like fucking Halo horse to me.
[33:05.220 --> 33:06.060]  I got immediately annoyed.
[33:08.660 --> 33:11.360]  Oh, God.
[33:12.100 --> 33:12.760]  Boy, you're right.
[33:13.500 --> 33:15.780]  What was the challenge we were talking about doing for Halo?
[33:16.920 --> 33:17.740]  I don't remember.
[33:17.860 --> 33:18.600]  Was it a Halo Reach?
[33:18.780 --> 33:19.640]  Was it the survival thing?
[33:19.660 --> 33:20.660]  Oh, it was ODST.
[33:20.920 --> 33:21.940]  It was the firefighting ODST.
[33:22.160 --> 33:24.100]  Oh, let's do that today.
[33:24.100 --> 33:27.840]  So the way I was able to work it, Eric, after the first one,
[33:27.940 --> 33:31.440]  is just to get real close to the edge and then just jump and then stop
[33:31.440 --> 33:32.960]  and then get as close to the edge.
[33:32.960 --> 33:33.780]  Oh, I didn't need to slide.
[33:34.220 --> 33:37.040]  Yeah, otherwise, if you don't like hard stop, you just stupid slide.
[33:37.380 --> 33:38.660]  Nick, your mouth's in my face.
[33:38.840 --> 33:39.680]  I, you know what?
[33:39.700 --> 33:42.500]  I wasn't having any bites over there, so I figured I'd stand on you.
[33:43.180 --> 33:44.440]  I'm rank five.
[33:49.010 --> 33:50.730]  If you catch something before I do.
[33:51.050 --> 33:51.290]  Damn it.
[33:51.650 --> 33:55.490]  Okay, I think you have to like, you have to like shift jump,
[33:55.490 --> 33:56.850]  but stop.
[33:57.430 --> 33:58.290]  Yeah, I'm trying.
[33:58.750 --> 34:00.690]  And it's annoying too that it usually starts you back.
[34:00.790 --> 34:02.910]  It feels like it's so close and then it's not.
[34:03.310 --> 34:04.490]  There's a thing over there.
[34:04.570 --> 34:05.650]  Oh my God, there is a thing over there.
[34:05.830 --> 34:06.750]  I can't reach.
[34:07.570 --> 34:07.930]  You're right.
[34:09.470 --> 34:10.190]  Oh shit.
[34:13.290 --> 34:14.910]  Can you do spear diving?
[34:16.610 --> 34:25.850]  Oh, Nick, you're almost in that.
[34:26.390 --> 34:26.750]  Almost.
[34:26.990 --> 34:27.370]  You got it.
[34:27.370 --> 34:28.030]  Oh, I got it.
[34:28.130 --> 34:28.430]  I got it.
[34:28.430 --> 34:29.270]  I got it, whatever it is.
[34:29.290 --> 34:29.750]  We've all got a bite.
[34:31.270 --> 34:32.810]  Mine's gonna be a little clown fish.
[34:32.970 --> 34:34.050]  I got a one.
[34:37.410 --> 34:38.490]  What is this?
[34:38.950 --> 34:39.690]  That's it.
[34:40.850 --> 34:41.490]  Oh, shrimp.
[34:41.710 --> 34:42.010]  A seahorse.
[34:42.310 --> 34:43.010]  You got a small shrimp.
[34:43.010 --> 34:43.950]  Oh, that was a seahorse?
[34:44.270 --> 34:46.570]  That was, that little thing flapping around was a seahorse.
[34:46.690 --> 34:46.970]  Shit.
[34:47.450 --> 34:49.770]  I'm gonna see how much my big bastards were worth.
[34:49.990 --> 34:51.370]  I'm gonna go get more bait.
[34:58.970 --> 34:59.850]  I quit.
[35:00.510 --> 35:01.350]  I don't want to do that.
[35:01.690 --> 35:02.630]  I don't give a fuck about it.
[35:02.630 --> 35:03.930]  I want to come and see what you guys are failing at.
[35:04.070 --> 35:04.490]  Yeah, me too.
[35:04.710 --> 35:05.270]  Yeah, come on over.
[35:05.690 --> 35:07.390]  Let me just sell my giant fish.
[35:08.490 --> 35:09.330]  All right, let's not brag.
[35:10.430 --> 35:13.430]  It's, uh, it's just a real annoying little platforming part.
[35:13.750 --> 35:16.570]  Oh wow, that hammerhead was 85 bucks.
[35:17.530 --> 35:17.810]  Wow.
[35:18.930 --> 35:21.870]  Oh, I'm so close to getting my freaking leech license.
[35:22.070 --> 35:22.910]  Holy shit.
[35:23.310 --> 35:25.270]  Oh, you know how I did it last night, Eric?
[35:25.370 --> 35:26.030]  Now that I think about it.
[35:26.430 --> 35:27.250]  Didn't I make it easier for you?
[35:27.310 --> 35:28.310]  I went to first person mode.
[35:28.830 --> 35:29.750]  What button is that?
[35:30.910 --> 35:32.390]  Uh, I just fucking overshot it.
[35:32.550 --> 35:33.630]  Uh, you just scroll in.
[35:33.790 --> 35:34.890]  I just, like, scroll in.
[35:34.890 --> 35:35.730]  Oh, okay, I see.
[35:44.440 --> 35:45.020]  There you go.
[35:45.240 --> 35:45.500]  Fuck.
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.120]  Who's that? You, who's the, is that Gavin?
[35:48.340 --> 35:48.680]  It's Gavin.
[35:49.040 --> 35:50.400]  Yeah, get your, get your bone, buddy.
[35:51.960 --> 35:52.600]  Spectral spine.
[35:55.100 --> 35:56.340]  Oh, wait, is this the thing you were trying to get?
[35:56.400 --> 35:57.100]  No, you fu-
[35:57.100 --> 35:57.500]  Yeah.
[35:57.920 --> 35:58.120]  Oh.
[35:59.240 --> 36:03.500]  If you get five pieces and pay 500 bucks, you can use, you can buy the fishing pole I have.
[36:05.860 --> 36:06.300]  Oops.
[36:06.560 --> 36:08.400]  It just keeps making me slide.
[36:09.100 --> 36:12.200]  Yeah, it's like if you hit shift twice, you slide, I think.
[36:12.580 --> 36:13.160]  Just press it once.
[36:13.640 --> 36:15.140]  Hold shift and press space once.
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.400]  Yeah, no shit.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.380]  I'm pressing it once.
[36:19.060 --> 36:20.560]  I know, it's making me dive.
[36:20.640 --> 36:21.600]  I'm not hitting it twice.
[36:23.740 --> 36:25.700]  All right, I'm gonna cam this, keep going.
[36:26.400 --> 36:26.560]  Fuck.
[36:32.680 --> 36:35.380]  This is like the fucking raid boss of the game.
[36:35.660 --> 36:36.020]  Fuck.
[36:36.020 --> 36:38.880]  What's, wait, what's wrong with you all that?
[36:40.500 --> 36:43.260]  I don't play mouse and keyboard games at all.
[36:43.460 --> 36:43.860]  Where am I?
[36:44.140 --> 36:44.960]  Keep shift in.
[36:45.400 --> 36:46.400]  Yeah, I know.
[36:46.700 --> 36:48.940]  It sent me back to the start.
[36:51.480 --> 36:51.960]  Shit.
[36:52.480 --> 36:54.340]  No, I didn't.
[36:54.660 --> 36:55.880]  Oh, it's right there.
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.400]  Yeah, you-
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.120]  Yes, Eric!
[36:59.380 --> 37:04.060]  Hey, hey, instead of jumping and trying to like land on the next one and then the next one,
[37:04.180 --> 37:05.380]  just keep holding forward.
[37:06.740 --> 37:08.100]  Keep holding forward and do it.
[37:08.340 --> 37:09.300]  It's so much easier.
[37:09.440 --> 37:10.120]  So don't jump?
[37:10.720 --> 37:11.140]  No, no.
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.740]  When you make like your jumps and everything, just keep,
[37:13.780 --> 37:16.300]  just keep holding forward and keep hitting the jumps.
[37:17.020 --> 37:18.580]  Just don't, don't stop.
[37:20.740 --> 37:21.580]  What are you laughing at?
[37:23.500 --> 37:23.860]  Fuck.
[37:24.020 --> 37:24.180]  What?
[37:25.020 --> 37:26.300]  Well, I don't need to do it, I've already done it.
[37:26.420 --> 37:26.560]  Oh, I can't.
[37:26.560 --> 37:26.880]  Shit!
[37:29.340 --> 37:29.700]  Ah!
[37:30.700 --> 37:32.420]  I sound like I'm missing something great.
[37:32.680 --> 37:33.840]  Oh, god damn it.
[37:34.360 --> 37:35.920]  He's watching Andrew try.
[37:36.100 --> 37:39.540]  I think there's other bones right around here too.
[37:40.080 --> 37:41.280]  Let me see if I can find it for you.
[37:41.420 --> 37:43.080]  Nick, have you done this jumping thing?
[37:43.100 --> 37:44.240]  I'm coming back, I'm almost there.
[37:44.540 --> 37:45.360]  They're all slippery!
[37:46.640 --> 37:47.340]  How do I-
[37:50.040 --> 37:50.480]  Yahoo!
[37:52.460 --> 37:54.740]  Oh, Nick's racing across.
[37:55.220 --> 37:56.160]  God damn it.
[37:57.260 --> 37:57.800]  Everybody shut up!
[37:58.120 --> 37:58.320]  No!
[37:59.180 --> 38:00.700]  Oh, Nick always did it first time.
[38:01.640 --> 38:02.780]  Everybody shut up.
[38:04.080 --> 38:04.840]  Andrew, you did a bit.
[38:04.860 --> 38:06.100]  Oh, I'm back at the start!
[38:07.220 --> 38:09.620]  Yeah, if you die too much, it'll send you right back to this.
[38:11.100 --> 38:11.500]  Okay.
[38:11.880 --> 38:14.460]  I did that for so long last night, and I've never seen-
[38:14.460 --> 38:16.200]  No, I skid-
[38:18.430 --> 38:20.010]  Are you doing a bit?
[38:20.930 --> 38:25.300]  God damn-
[38:25.820 --> 38:26.220]  Stop!
[38:26.400 --> 38:37.420]  Oh, I'm gonna shit if you keep doing this.
[38:37.840 --> 38:39.380]  I'm at the- if anybody-
[38:39.380 --> 38:40.280]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[38:40.380 --> 38:41.680]  I saw where you hit the, uh-
[38:41.680 --> 38:41.980]  Fuck!
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.400]  It's right here, if you want to get it.
[38:44.500 --> 38:45.120]  It's number three.
[38:45.400 --> 38:46.420]  What are you doing?
[38:50.740 --> 38:52.820]  God damn it, I'm just going too fast.
[38:53.060 --> 38:53.300]  Stop!
[38:53.500 --> 38:53.740]  All right.
[38:54.300 --> 38:54.860]  Wait a minute.
[38:55.220 --> 38:55.600]  Here we go.
[38:56.780 --> 38:57.360]  Oh no!
[38:59.140 --> 38:59.920]  Where are you, Geoff?
[39:00.200 --> 39:00.500]  No!
[39:01.280 --> 39:02.060]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[39:02.940 --> 39:04.640]  These are the three that I remember.
[39:05.240 --> 39:07.700]  I don't specifically remember where the other-
[39:07.700 --> 39:10.880]  Two are, but I know they're-
[39:10.880 --> 39:11.440]  Easy to find.
[39:12.600 --> 39:15.500]  And then you just sell them to the little bait guy or whatever?
[39:15.700 --> 39:16.360]  No, you don't.
[39:16.420 --> 39:19.540]  You then go to the waterfall, and then you walk through the waterfall,
[39:19.760 --> 39:21.760]  and behind the waterfall is like a special grave.
[39:21.780 --> 39:23.040]  Okay, so don't sell them.
[39:23.460 --> 39:24.160]  No, don't sell them.
[39:24.400 --> 39:26.400]  I'm missing out on my leech license for this.
[39:26.900 --> 39:27.740]  I don't know if you can.
[39:28.020 --> 39:28.560]  I, uh-
[39:28.560 --> 39:30.080]  I did. It's like zero dollars.
[39:30.200 --> 39:30.940]  I sold that first one.
[39:31.320 --> 39:32.460]  Oh, you probably have to go back and get it again.
[39:32.460 --> 39:33.600]  Yeah, I'll just go back and collect it.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.100]  It's fine. I know where it's at, so it's not a big deal.
[39:35.660 --> 39:36.180]  Oh!
[39:37.180 --> 39:38.220]  I-
[39:38.220 --> 39:39.420]  What are you doing?
[39:41.860 --> 39:42.300]  Shit!
[39:42.940 --> 39:44.020]  What are you doing?
[39:45.120 --> 39:45.920]  Hey, Nick!
[39:46.180 --> 39:47.720]  Yeah! I did it! I'm free!
[39:50.340 --> 39:50.860]  No!
[39:52.240 --> 39:53.620]  Doesn't that look good, Gavin?
[39:54.600 --> 39:56.360]  No! Why does it keep happening?
[39:56.720 --> 39:57.620]  Keeps diving.
[39:58.480 --> 39:59.600]  Andrew, what are you doing, man?
[39:59.720 --> 40:00.920]  It keeps diving on me.
[40:01.540 --> 40:02.020]  Why-
[40:02.020 --> 40:02.620]  Oh, no!
[40:02.620 --> 40:02.860]  No!
[40:03.940 --> 40:06.120]  Why weren't you like this in Survive Block Island?
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.580]  Oh, because I had a controller.
[40:09.520 --> 40:09.820]  Yeah.
[40:10.260 --> 40:11.680]  Yeah, a controller really helps.
[40:11.900 --> 40:14.360]  This- a mouse and keyboard is like so not my shit.
[40:14.700 --> 40:16.740]  You played on PC Minecraft with a controller?
[40:17.080 --> 40:17.360]  Yeah.
[40:17.980 --> 40:18.440]  That's nuts.
[40:20.460 --> 40:22.040]  I got the other angle on this, Gavin.
[40:24.180 --> 40:24.620]  Fuck!
[40:26.680 --> 40:27.880]  Oh, I ended up catching something.
[40:28.100 --> 40:29.060]  Oh, Nick's about to get something.
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.220]  No!
[40:34.240 --> 40:35.440]  God damn it!
[40:39.060 --> 40:39.860]  A flounder.
[40:39.860 --> 40:40.560]  Ka-why?
[40:41.660 --> 40:42.720]  Ka-why?
[40:43.340 --> 40:43.900]  Kawhi Leonard?
[40:44.360 --> 40:45.320]  Does he still play basketball?
[40:45.840 --> 40:46.140]  God!
[40:48.220 --> 40:49.720]  Uh, in theory.
[40:51.020 --> 40:51.240]  He's in-
[40:51.240 --> 40:51.480]  Oh!
[40:52.180 --> 40:52.400]  Oh!
[40:52.540 --> 40:52.960]  I mean, yeah.
[40:53.100 --> 40:53.740]  That looked cool.
[40:55.680 --> 40:56.420]  Come on, Joe!
[40:57.180 --> 41:01.020]  I heard that he's so upset that he almost cries sometimes.
[41:01.140 --> 41:01.360]  Oh.
[41:01.360 --> 41:03.480]  At night- during games when he- because he can't play.
[41:03.480 --> 41:05.940]  That is sad, because he's really, really good when he does play.
[41:06.480 --> 41:06.760]  Wow.
[41:07.280 --> 41:07.900]  When was that?
[41:07.940 --> 41:08.280]  2019?
[41:09.620 --> 41:12.040]  I was thinking 2014 when he won a championship with the Spurs.
[41:12.540 --> 41:12.860]  Fuck.
[41:13.460 --> 41:14.260]  The last good year.
[41:14.260 --> 41:16.200]  I don't think he's had a fully healthy year since 2019.
[41:16.540 --> 41:17.440]  The last good year of basketball.
[41:17.440 --> 41:18.220]  I'm never gonna do this.
[41:18.600 --> 41:19.940]  The last good year of basketball.
[41:20.160 --> 41:20.880]  For me...
[41:22.140 --> 41:24.100]  It's been 10 years, Geoff!
[41:24.300 --> 41:24.940]  10 years!
[41:24.940 --> 41:27.600]  Dude, you guys just got Victor Wim Binyaru.
[41:27.600 --> 41:29.240]  I know, we're back, but not really.
[41:30.420 --> 41:30.780]  Dude.
[41:30.780 --> 41:32.420]  At least it's something fucking fun to watch.
[41:32.620 --> 41:35.000]  It's the one dude everybody on earth wants to see play.
[41:36.620 --> 41:37.220]  I'm going.
[41:37.620 --> 41:38.240]  I'm going soon.
[41:38.940 --> 41:39.300]  Are you?
[41:39.600 --> 41:40.040]  Are you really?
[41:40.880 --> 41:41.120]  Yeah.
[41:41.220 --> 41:43.000]  I got another one for you, Eric, if you want it.
[41:43.080 --> 41:43.580]  Oh, I'm coming.
[41:43.680 --> 41:43.980]  Hang on.
[41:45.200 --> 41:45.840]  Okay, here I come.
[41:46.660 --> 41:47.260]  Coming to you.
[41:48.580 --> 41:49.080]  Andrew, this is nuts.
[41:49.080 --> 41:49.440]  Oh, it's over here?
[41:50.060 --> 41:50.560]  There you go!
[41:50.600 --> 41:50.960]  You got it!
[41:51.120 --> 41:51.360]  This is it!
[41:51.420 --> 41:52.740]  Don't play on this!
[41:53.540 --> 41:54.260]  Just sprint!
[41:55.060 --> 41:55.780]  Sprint jump!
[41:56.000 --> 41:56.620]  I am!
[41:56.720 --> 41:57.560]  And I just...
[41:58.460 --> 41:58.780]  Sprint!
[41:59.200 --> 42:01.020]  You can probably Google it real fast.
[42:02.180 --> 42:03.420]  I'll just get it another time.
[42:03.500 --> 42:04.360]  I'm going to play this some more.
[42:04.700 --> 42:05.580]  This is a fun little game.
[42:05.640 --> 42:06.120]  This is fun.
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.200]  Because you're pretty much right there.
[42:07.320 --> 42:10.140]  If you want to come to me right here, I'll show you where to get it when it's done.
[42:10.520 --> 42:11.560]  Just go right behind this waterfall.
[42:11.820 --> 42:13.440]  Send me back to the town square.
[42:13.600 --> 42:14.560]  I'll be there in a minute.
[42:14.780 --> 42:15.740]  Talk to the grave.
[42:15.940 --> 42:16.480]  Oh, neat.
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.980]  Next goal is something that's 500.
[42:19.340 --> 42:20.000]  Oh my god.
[42:20.100 --> 42:20.760]  Let's see what we got!
[42:21.500 --> 42:21.680]  Wow.
[42:21.840 --> 42:23.780]  But you'll get to a point where like...
[42:23.780 --> 42:24.660]  It doesn't really matter.
[42:25.160 --> 42:26.200]  Well, it does.
[42:26.260 --> 42:28.320]  But my upgrades are like $8,000 now.
[42:28.760 --> 42:29.180]  Oh, Jesus.
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.100]  It gets pretty pricey pretty fast.
[42:31.200 --> 42:31.320]  Heads up.
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.140]  All right, I'm gonna start fishing again.
[42:33.400 --> 42:34.220]  Yeah, let's fish while we wait.
[42:34.340 --> 42:35.140]  Are you trying to get your leech license?
[42:35.580 --> 42:37.340]  Yeah, I need to get more crickets first.
[42:37.920 --> 42:38.840]  How much was the leech license?
[42:39.660 --> 42:40.460]  Leech license?
[42:40.540 --> 42:41.220]  400, I think.
[42:42.120 --> 42:42.900]  That sounds right.
[42:43.440 --> 42:44.020]  What does that do?
[42:44.680 --> 42:44.980]  Leeches.
[42:44.980 --> 42:46.020]  You can use leech bait.
[42:47.120 --> 42:47.900]  What does that do?
[42:48.380 --> 42:52.860]  I think the better the bait, the higher the chance you catch higher starfish.
[42:53.520 --> 42:53.660]  Oh.
[42:53.660 --> 42:54.760]  Like starfish?
[42:55.100 --> 42:57.880]  Can you imagine sucking on a leech and then being yanked up a lighthouse?
[42:58.080 --> 42:58.660]  That'd be cool.
[42:58.860 --> 42:59.220]  It's like...
[42:59.220 --> 43:00.680]  That would be like eating slugs.
[43:01.040 --> 43:03.340]  Yeah, that's like slug-like behavior.
[43:03.840 --> 43:05.080]  That's their getting abducted.
[43:08.180 --> 43:09.600]  Can I fast travel?
[43:11.080 --> 43:12.140]  Oh, here's a...
[43:12.140 --> 43:13.000]  Well, nobody's around me.
[43:13.500 --> 43:13.760]  What?
[43:14.260 --> 43:14.820]  I just...
[43:14.820 --> 43:18.480]  I saw one of those places in the water that went away.
[43:19.420 --> 43:23.100]  Yeah, they go away after like a second or whatever.
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.840]  You just have to throw that thing.
[43:24.840 --> 43:25.420]  Oh, Andrew's back.
[43:26.060 --> 43:26.780]  Yeah, throw that thing.
[43:26.860 --> 43:27.480]  How do you free cam?
[43:27.860 --> 43:28.120]  Fuck.
[43:30.340 --> 43:31.840]  Are you still trying to get it, Andrew?
[43:31.980 --> 43:32.300]  Yes.
[43:32.480 --> 43:34.600]  Gavin, how do you free cam?
[43:34.800 --> 43:35.300]  How do you free cam?
[43:35.700 --> 43:37.720]  I press the camera in the top right and then just...
[43:37.720 --> 43:39.040]  It's the end button.
[43:40.560 --> 43:41.860]  And then press H to get rid of the HUD.
[43:42.180 --> 43:42.820]  All right.
[43:44.120 --> 43:45.380]  Look at this.
[43:46.180 --> 43:46.700]  All right.
[43:48.600 --> 43:50.320]  A lot of money in these waters, Gavin.
[43:50.580 --> 43:52.060]  A lot of money waiting for us.
[43:52.060 --> 43:53.600]  We just got to pull it out.
[43:54.080 --> 43:54.840]  Nature's ATM.
[44:00.280 --> 44:01.560]  That's what our oceans are.
[44:01.760 --> 44:02.620]  I love that.
[44:04.240 --> 44:05.260]  All right, just this.
[44:05.640 --> 44:06.360]  Oh my God.
[44:06.600 --> 44:06.980]  All right.
[44:08.860 --> 44:09.680]  Oh, here we go.
[44:10.060 --> 44:13.720]  And now, Andrew's attempt.
[44:13.960 --> 44:14.340]  And he's done.
[44:14.460 --> 44:15.020]  I got this now.
[44:15.980 --> 44:16.560]  And here he goes.
[44:16.600 --> 44:17.200]  I also...
[44:17.200 --> 44:17.640]  And he's dead.
[44:18.840 --> 44:20.680]  Just so you guys know, I feel like...
[44:20.680 --> 44:23.980]  You feel every upgrade and it feels like...
[44:25.600 --> 44:26.300]  Did you do it, Andrew?
[44:26.440 --> 44:27.160]  No, I'm about to.
[44:27.240 --> 44:28.700]  You definitely feel yourself getting better.
[44:28.800 --> 44:29.700]  There it is. There it is.
[44:29.860 --> 44:30.240]  Now, flick.
[44:30.620 --> 44:31.980]  Are there any haptic mice?
[44:34.960 --> 44:35.640]  Great question.
[44:35.880 --> 44:37.740]  I want a little rumble in my mouth.
[44:37.800 --> 44:38.140]  Yes!
[44:40.040 --> 44:40.380]  Oh.
[44:41.000 --> 44:41.800]  He did it.
[44:44.900 --> 44:45.760]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[44:45.920 --> 44:46.580]  You did it, Andrew.
[44:47.780 --> 44:48.580]  There you go, buddy.
[44:48.660 --> 44:51.380]  A plastic bag, 12 centimeters.
[44:54.300 --> 44:56.780]  Of the five of us, who do you think is the most plastic?
[44:58.860 --> 45:02.780]  The most micro, nanoplastics by volume.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.680]  I think probably me.
[45:05.120 --> 45:06.580]  Really? I think it's me.
[45:06.760 --> 45:08.120]  Well, I just think I've been on Earth longest.
[45:08.220 --> 45:08.680]  Oh, yeah.
[45:09.400 --> 45:11.700]  I just think I'm a microplastics guy.
[45:11.960 --> 45:12.880]  Like, not by...
[45:12.880 --> 45:13.420]  Not by desire.
[45:13.420 --> 45:14.720]  I just sort of like by accident.
[45:14.780 --> 45:14.980]  Yeah.
[45:14.980 --> 45:19.240]  I grew up in an era when we microwaved plastic with glee.
[45:19.440 --> 45:20.880]  Boy, that's, you know.
[45:21.200 --> 45:21.700]  Fair point.
[45:22.080 --> 45:22.640]  You know.
[45:23.360 --> 45:25.760]  My parents are still about microwaving and cling wrap.
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.540]  I don't know why.
[45:27.020 --> 45:27.420]  Wow.
[45:29.240 --> 45:30.280]  Large flounder.
[45:30.320 --> 45:31.200]  Well, it keeps the heat in.
[45:34.360 --> 45:36.080]  And it leeches the plastic out.
[45:36.680 --> 45:37.500]  Ooh, leeches.
[45:37.540 --> 45:38.800]  What did pills used to come in?
[45:39.500 --> 45:39.760]  What?
[45:40.020 --> 45:40.180]  What?
[45:40.640 --> 45:40.860]  What?
[45:41.280 --> 45:41.800]  Pills?
[45:41.900 --> 45:42.580]  What are you asking?
[45:42.880 --> 45:43.640]  What used to come in?
[45:44.100 --> 45:44.400]  Pills.
[45:47.060 --> 45:47.420]  Bottles?
[45:47.660 --> 45:48.520]  Yeah, what are you getting at?
[45:49.340 --> 45:50.040]  Well, like they come...
[45:50.040 --> 45:52.880]  The prescription pills come in plastic bottles.
[45:53.200 --> 45:53.740]  Oh, the little...
[45:53.740 --> 45:54.120]  Wait.
[45:55.320 --> 45:57.940]  Oh, used to come in glass bottles before we had plastic bottles?
[45:58.100 --> 45:58.960]  Is that what you're asking?
[45:59.720 --> 46:00.080]  Yes.
[46:00.500 --> 46:01.260]  Did I not say it?
[46:01.840 --> 46:02.940]  Well, I just don't know what...
[46:02.940 --> 46:03.140]  I...
[46:03.140 --> 46:03.520]  It did...
[46:03.520 --> 46:04.460]  It was just a weird question.
[46:04.600 --> 46:06.200]  I thought you meant the capsule for a second.
[46:06.340 --> 46:07.000]  Yeah, me too.
[46:07.660 --> 46:08.380]  The capsule?
[46:08.760 --> 46:10.140]  The thing that you put in your mouth.
[46:10.200 --> 46:11.320]  You know, the pill.
[46:12.000 --> 46:12.680]  That's what I mean.
[46:13.120 --> 46:13.460]  Oh.
[46:14.360 --> 46:15.360]  The prescription...
[46:15.360 --> 46:18.000]  But they also come from the store in a plastic container.
[46:18.700 --> 46:19.120]  We went...
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.740]  We went two directions in...
[46:21.500 --> 46:22.300]  Oh my God.
[46:22.340 --> 46:24.180]  I feel like my brain just got drawn...
[46:26.180 --> 46:28.080]  Wait, what are you...
[46:28.080 --> 46:31.260]  I'm saying, you know when you get a prescription and they give you a pill bottle?
[46:31.580 --> 46:32.000]  Yes.
[46:33.040 --> 46:34.520]  What was that before plastic?
[46:36.180 --> 46:38.500]  So the bottle, not the thing you ingest.
[46:39.020 --> 46:39.280]  Yes?
[46:39.620 --> 46:40.400]  It was a glass bottle.
[46:40.880 --> 46:41.820]  And a satchel.
[46:41.820 --> 46:43.380]  What are you saying?
[46:43.980 --> 46:46.500]  Oh God, I love this so much, Gavin.
[46:46.680 --> 46:50.220]  They used to be glass bottles and Eric, he doesn't understand.
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.820]  Or Nick, he doesn't understand what you're talking about.
[46:52.840 --> 46:54.220]  The thing that you eat?
[46:54.620 --> 46:55.420]  That you take?
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.760]  The little plastic gel capsule that the medicine goes in.
[47:03.020 --> 47:05.260]  They're like clear and rubbery sometimes.
[47:05.620 --> 47:06.120]  Yeah, the pills?
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.220]  You're an actual psychopath.
[47:15.660 --> 47:16.880]  Which one, me or Nick?
[47:17.400 --> 47:17.720]  You!
[47:18.640 --> 47:19.740]  Well, both, but...
[47:20.860 --> 47:22.380]  Yeah, but I'm right this time.
[47:23.460 --> 47:27.600]  By the way, I don't think you have to take your fucking fishing pole out of the water
[47:27.600 --> 47:28.940]  to put new bait on it.
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.200]  You just switch it in the tackle box and it seems to attach.
[47:33.460 --> 47:35.660]  So wait, what do you think I was talking about?
[47:36.740 --> 47:37.440]  The pill.
[47:37.480 --> 47:39.580]  I still don't know what you were talking about.
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.140]  It was a debate between whether you're talking about the pill bottle or the pill that you took.
[47:44.260 --> 47:46.420]  Yeah, I said what did pills come in?
[47:50.620 --> 47:54.200]  We have to end this video. I don't know if I can take this anymore.
[47:54.820 --> 47:57.100]  But Nick, were you saying that the pills themselves?
[47:59.240 --> 48:02.880]  I was asking if that's what you were saying and so is Eric.
[48:03.080 --> 48:05.420]  It really wasn't clear what you were saying, Gavin.
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.900]  Everyone kept asking you what you mean and then you just keep going, yeah.
[48:11.200 --> 48:13.980]  No, I said prescription pills in the bottle.
[48:15.460 --> 48:16.840]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:17.080 --> 48:20.220]  Right, right. And then we say the bottle or the pill.
[48:20.520 --> 48:21.000]  And then you go, yeah.
[48:21.240 --> 48:21.560]  And then you went, yeah.
[48:21.660 --> 48:22.660]  And then we go, the pill?
[48:22.680 --> 48:23.120]  You said yes to both.
[48:23.240 --> 48:23.920]  And then you go, oh!
[48:24.120 --> 48:25.320]  The one that comes in plastic.
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.400]  Where's the plastic in a pill?
[48:27.940 --> 48:30.860]  Right, which is what we're asking you, you dunce.
[48:34.020 --> 48:35.940]  So who won the fishing jamboree, Geoff?
[48:37.360 --> 48:40.620]  Yeah! Oh, we should gather. We should gather for a photo.
[48:40.740 --> 48:41.300]  Oh, yeah.
[48:42.060 --> 48:43.140]  Let's gather in the town.
[48:43.940 --> 48:46.180]  Oh, what if we use all of our money?
[48:46.820 --> 48:48.100]  Oh, Geoff has loads of money though, right?
[48:48.740 --> 48:49.100]  Yeah.
[48:49.240 --> 48:49.760]  Oh, never mind.
[48:50.320 --> 48:50.500]  Why?
[48:50.800 --> 48:56.800]  Well, I was going to say we should all buy like five scratch cards and whoever wins the most on them wins the fishing jamboree.
[48:56.960 --> 48:58.820]  Oh, I don't have any money.
[48:59.940 --> 49:00.300]  Okay.
[49:00.500 --> 49:00.840]  Okay, well, let's do it.
[49:00.840 --> 49:02.800]  I have $13 because I just bought upgrades.
[49:02.800 --> 49:03.060]  Next year.
[49:05.040 --> 49:06.460]  I'll see you guys in town.
[49:07.080 --> 49:07.780]  I'm in town.
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.320]  That's an interesting turn.
[49:11.880 --> 49:14.380]  I just don't know how there was a misunderstanding there.
[49:14.960 --> 49:18.900]  Well, because we kept asking you what you mean and then you kept not clarifying.
[49:19.280 --> 49:19.600]  Yeah.
[49:21.520 --> 49:22.600]  How do you sit?
[49:23.580 --> 49:26.380]  You hold C and then it's one of the emotes.
[49:26.940 --> 49:27.460]  Oh.
[49:27.460 --> 49:30.880]  How do I get back to town?
[49:31.480 --> 49:32.560]  You walk to it.
[49:32.680 --> 49:33.920]  You just stood up on it and did it.
[49:34.000 --> 49:34.180]  Yep.
[49:35.060 --> 49:35.460]  Smart.
[49:38.660 --> 49:41.180]  If I drown myself enough, will it just put me in town?
[49:41.500 --> 49:42.800]  I don't think so.
[49:42.860 --> 49:43.840]  In my experience, yes.
[49:44.260 --> 49:45.340]  Yeah, I've done it.
[49:45.620 --> 49:47.260]  Right next to my fart scribble.
[49:47.500 --> 49:50.500]  Everybody check and make sure you have all your pop-up points.
[49:51.940 --> 49:52.480]  Oh, yeah, I did.
[49:52.580 --> 49:52.980]  Rewards.
[49:53.820 --> 49:54.160]  Oh.
[49:56.520 --> 49:58.180]  I'm tired now from that conversation.
[49:58.220 --> 49:59.460]  Yeah, me too.
[49:59.660 --> 50:00.900]  Here, let's take a group photo.
[50:01.820 --> 50:02.560]  How'd you take your fish out?
[50:03.360 --> 50:04.300]  Oh, I sold all mine.
[50:04.520 --> 50:06.640]  Yeah, I don't have any.
[50:07.540 --> 50:08.460]  That's sad for you guys.
[50:08.560 --> 50:09.500]  Can I pull my money out?
[50:10.460 --> 50:14.840]  Everybody go catch a fish real fast and then we all have to stand in front of the fart zone and take a photo.
[50:15.100 --> 50:15.340]  Alright.
[50:16.440 --> 50:18.520]  How do I get back? I don't know where I am.
[50:19.020 --> 50:19.820]  Are you at the lighthouse?
[50:21.400 --> 50:23.380]  I just went into my backpack.
[50:23.380 --> 50:26.520]  Went to creatures and then just double clicked on it.
[50:26.680 --> 50:26.800]  Yeah.
[50:26.840 --> 50:28.840]  I'm trying to drown myself back to the start.
[50:30.420 --> 50:31.340]  Hell yeah, Andrew.
[50:31.660 --> 50:32.800]  Let's fucking do this.
[50:34.480 --> 50:36.440]  Hang on, I'm trying to catch a fish really fast.
[50:36.600 --> 50:37.800]  We're like a medieval fight.
[50:37.880 --> 50:39.060]  Like a hammer versus sword.
[50:39.620 --> 50:40.480]  I'm going to stab you.
[50:40.840 --> 50:42.620]  We're playing for honor right now.
[50:44.920 --> 50:45.900]  Can you get the point again?
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.980]  Spread your cheeks and we can make some money.
[50:50.840 --> 50:52.840]  You're going to get the bonus.
[50:55.540 --> 50:56.920]  Trying to get it in.
[51:00.300 --> 51:01.800]  True, $50,000 bonus.
[51:03.740 --> 51:04.560]  Hey, I'm back.
[51:05.300 --> 51:07.400]  Alright, here I come with a...
[51:07.400 --> 51:08.580]  Oh, come on.
[51:09.180 --> 51:09.940]  This sucks.
[51:11.300 --> 51:12.400]  Alright, here I...
[51:12.400 --> 51:13.520]  Alright, here I come, guys.
[51:13.740 --> 51:15.860]  We all have cool fish.
[51:18.640 --> 51:21.220]  We all have really cool fish, right?
[51:21.940 --> 51:22.760]  Do you guys...
[51:22.760 --> 51:26.080]  You're right in the middle of the earth, so there's no missing it.
[51:26.940 --> 51:27.680]  Let's go.
[51:28.600 --> 51:30.000]  I want some fish.
[51:32.260 --> 51:32.660]  Oh!
[51:37.240 --> 51:37.640]  There.
[51:38.340 --> 51:39.400]  I'm just going to hold a bone.
[51:40.940 --> 51:42.360]  I'll just hold a spine.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.560]  What'd I get, what'd I get, what'd I get?
[51:46.740 --> 51:48.180]  Oh, that's going to be depressing.
[51:49.240 --> 51:50.660]  Yeah, mine is too.
[51:50.740 --> 51:51.860]  Don't worry about it.
[51:52.080 --> 51:53.780]  Nothing's going to compete with Andrew's.
[51:57.440 --> 51:58.400]  Good God.
[52:00.540 --> 52:02.320]  How do you take out...
[52:02.320 --> 52:04.200]  You go to your bag.
[52:04.360 --> 52:06.320]  Don't worry, Gavin just left town.
[52:06.620 --> 52:06.720]  Shit.
[52:07.560 --> 52:08.400]  Oh, I have a treasure chest.
[52:08.660 --> 52:09.540]  Open your bag.
[52:10.220 --> 52:12.180]  Go next to tools as creatures.
[52:12.180 --> 52:12.940]  Oh, yeah.
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.200]  You mean the one?
[52:15.860 --> 52:16.700]  Hey, what do you think of this?
[52:16.880 --> 52:20.000]  I can't see.
[52:20.040 --> 52:20.500]  Where's Nick?
[52:21.120 --> 52:22.120]  Nick, you have to come closer.
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.100]  Well, don't get right in front of me, you idiot.
[52:26.340 --> 52:27.120]  No, I can see.
[52:28.120 --> 52:32.200]  Should we all slide further into the fart zone?
[52:32.540 --> 52:34.300]  Gavin, you direct us.
[52:35.140 --> 52:37.820]  Yeah, shimmy towards the T of fart.
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.940]  Let's try and get everyone between the F and the T.
[52:44.660 --> 52:46.700]  I'm going to have this swordfish through my face.
[52:47.120 --> 52:47.460]  Me too.
[52:48.120 --> 52:51.500]  And then we'll try and make Nick's fish look a little bigger.
[52:51.580 --> 52:52.040]  Come closer.
[52:53.340 --> 52:54.800]  It's not a fish, it's a crayfish.
[52:55.180 --> 52:56.480]  Keep coming. Keep walking.
[52:56.880 --> 52:58.400]  Yeah, past me. Way past me.
[52:58.540 --> 52:59.040]  Yeah, keep going.
[52:59.800 --> 53:02.020]  Oh, nice hamburger shirt, Nick.
[53:02.380 --> 53:02.780]  Thank you.
[53:04.300 --> 53:05.180]  How about here?
[53:05.500 --> 53:05.860]  Keep going.
[53:08.240 --> 53:09.260]  A little bit more.
[53:09.980 --> 53:10.320]  Keep going.
[53:10.320 --> 53:12.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:12.460 --> 53:13.260]  More, more, more.
[53:13.520 --> 53:14.860]  A little bit back.
[53:16.520 --> 53:17.800]  Is he in the photo?
[53:19.460 --> 53:19.960]  What's it look like?
[53:20.620 --> 53:22.960]  Everyone say cheese.
[53:23.920 --> 53:24.400]  Cheese!
[53:25.780 --> 53:26.740]  What the fuck, cheese?
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.240]  Oh, that's such a good photo.
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.440]  That's a great photo.
[53:31.580 --> 53:32.140]  That's pretty cool.
[53:32.420 --> 53:34.280]  I'm not in it at all.
[53:34.600 --> 53:35.420]  That's pretty cool.
[53:36.160 --> 53:37.600]  Nick, go in front of you a little bit.
[53:37.600 --> 53:39.380]  Yeah, just a little bit. Good photo.
[53:39.600 --> 53:41.840]  Wait, hold on. What if I do this?
[53:43.220 --> 53:44.060]  You see him now?
[53:45.500 --> 53:47.360]  We already got the photo.
[53:47.660 --> 53:48.800]  No, wait. Let's take another one.
[53:52.460 --> 53:53.260]  That's better.
[53:53.400 --> 53:53.880]  That's even better.
[53:56.320 --> 53:56.760]  Ridiculous.
[53:57.100 --> 53:57.900]  Now you can see him.
[53:59.260 --> 54:00.140]  So stupid.
[54:02.320 --> 54:02.760]  Dumbass.
