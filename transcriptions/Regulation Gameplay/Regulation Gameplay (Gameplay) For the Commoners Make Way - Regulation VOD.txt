[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  Welcome! It's Friday, it's 4pm, we're playing Makeway, and what you just got for the last
[00:06.600 --> 00:14.440]  five minutes is how it's been for the four of us since 11 this morning, screaming at each other
[00:14.440 --> 00:20.240]  in heists. But now, instead of heisting, we're gonna race against each other, Makeway is a game
[00:20.240 --> 00:24.940]  that we've played before, but we never played with Gavin. Gavin, do you know anything about
[00:24.940 --> 00:30.260]  this game? You drive the car? You don't know anything about it. So, a big reason that I brought this
[00:30.260 --> 00:37.560]  game to us initially is that I felt like you were going to love it, because it is like Ultimate
[00:37.560 --> 00:45.420]  Chicken Horse, where everything's in rounds, and then you will see the way that you build the
[00:45.420 --> 00:49.880]  track as you keep going, and the whole thing keeps going. It's very exciting. Oh, we had a shitload
[00:49.880 --> 00:59.220]  of gifted subs. Raw nom noms, 10 gifted subs. Valorant. Regulation Rat. Regulation Rat with five.
[00:59.900 --> 01:05.360]  Thank you so much. Oh, Defalcon. There we go. Alright, pick your car, boys. Alright, got it. Gavin
[01:05.360 --> 01:11.760]  complaining about lack of name burns in five. No, it's in the game. It's in the game, it's right there, baby.
[01:11.760 --> 01:19.900]  Uh, don't call attention to it. Yellow piss car? Yellow piss car, piss rats. Does the car matter in this?
[01:20.420 --> 01:29.180]  Uh, not particularly. What the hell? Those are tracks. Come on, Andrew. Yeah, so now it's...
[01:29.180 --> 01:34.140]  and now everyone races to put, damn it, to put their pieces together with this thing. God damn it.
[01:34.740 --> 01:40.400]  Why is my, where's my... Yours is a ramp. Yours is a ramp. It's gotta go on the track. It goes on the track.
[01:41.640 --> 01:47.240]  There you go. It goes where, oh my god, what a bad spot. Hold right trigger to drive.
[01:48.280 --> 01:57.340]  Oh shit, we're off. Oh god. Oh, how do I hammer people? Oh, you bastard. But when you go off,
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.260]  it keeps going, like, you come back. Oh my god. I'm alive, I'm alive. Yes! No!
[02:04.940 --> 02:14.260]  Wow. So, so now, Gavin, uh, it will give us, it'll go back to the choosing stage. Oh, fire hole, oh shit.
[02:14.660 --> 02:18.300]  Yep. Oh, I wanted the fire hole. We get pieces and parts and we put it all back, baby.
[02:18.880 --> 02:21.620]  Oh, that sucks.
[02:24.260 --> 02:32.660]  Whoa! Oh, that's awesome. Fire hole. Have you never had a fire hole? There we go.
[02:32.660 --> 02:40.000]  Oh, I've had a fire hole. I did pinatas. I'm aware. I don't know anything about them,
[02:40.100 --> 02:44.520]  but I had them, baby. Hey, in about six months, everybody's gonna love that story.
[02:44.720 --> 02:52.980]  Oh, jump 100 meters and land it. Oh god oh god oh god oh god. Do you lose shit if you fall off? Do
[02:52.980 --> 02:58.480]  you lose points? Yeah, you only get points if you cross the finish, for each chapter. Oh, god damn
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.500]  I thought it was over!
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.040]  Oh no!
[03:00.040 --> 03:01.120]  Where the hell am I? I'm alive!
[03:01.380 --> 03:01.920]  Fire in the hole!
[03:02.260 --> 03:02.400]  No!
[03:02.620 --> 03:02.940]  Whoa!
[03:04.000 --> 03:04.440]  Ah, shit!
[03:04.440 --> 03:05.080]  I won again!
[03:05.720 --> 03:06.500]  I got achievement.
[03:07.420 --> 03:07.740]  Perfection.
[03:08.520 --> 03:08.840]  Nice!
[03:08.840 --> 03:09.900]  Wow, you made it all the way.
[03:10.100 --> 03:10.620]  Nick came in first.
[03:10.700 --> 03:11.900]  Oh, Gavin's still in first.
[03:12.100 --> 03:12.420]  Goddamn.
[03:12.800 --> 03:13.120]  Wow!
[03:13.260 --> 03:13.700]  We'll catch him.
[03:14.800 --> 03:15.660]  Ooh, get that one.
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.340]  I hate this one.
[03:16.560 --> 03:17.200]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.780]  Oh, you fucking know it.
[03:19.780 --> 03:22.320]  So you end up back at the beginning?
[03:22.660 --> 03:23.320]  Yeah, every time.
[03:23.440 --> 03:23.540]  The first bit?
[03:23.780 --> 03:24.040]  Okay.
[03:24.680 --> 03:25.080]  Well, yeah.
[03:25.420 --> 03:26.080]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[03:27.480 --> 03:28.400]  What are you laying down, Nick?
[03:28.400 --> 03:29.880]  Oh my god.
[03:29.940 --> 03:30.960]  No, it's all Andrew.
[03:31.180 --> 03:32.820]  Oh, that's... oh, Andrew has the mammoth.
[03:32.960 --> 03:33.580]  Oh, terrible.
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.060]  A man-moth.
[03:37.760 --> 03:40.280]  M-A-N-M-O-TH.
[03:40.280 --> 03:40.300]  No!
[03:40.800 --> 03:41.180]  I'm alive!
[03:42.040 --> 03:42.280]  Oh!
[03:42.720 --> 03:43.140]  Land it!
[03:43.320 --> 03:43.560]  Land it!
[03:44.980 --> 03:45.640]  Please, no!
[03:46.080 --> 03:46.460]  No!
[03:46.800 --> 03:47.480]  Oh, goddammit.
[03:48.540 --> 03:48.820]  Ow.
[03:49.040 --> 03:49.120]  Ah!
[03:49.540 --> 03:49.800]  Yes!
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.560]  Get in front of central.
[03:51.720 --> 03:52.020]  No!
[03:52.340 --> 03:52.780]  Oh god!
[03:52.840 --> 03:53.220]  Oh god!
[03:53.320 --> 03:53.900]  Ah, shit!
[03:54.220 --> 03:54.500]  No!
[03:54.780 --> 03:55.360]  Shit butt.
[03:55.840 --> 03:56.180]  Kalali.
[03:58.560 --> 03:59.480]  Oh god.
[03:59.500 --> 04:00.120]  Ah!
[04:00.760 --> 04:01.380]  No!
[04:01.880 --> 04:02.580]  I've got myself!
[04:04.040 --> 04:04.660]  Dammit.
[04:04.740 --> 04:05.020]  I'm alive.
[04:05.200 --> 04:05.500]  I'm alive.
[04:07.280 --> 04:07.700]  Oh!
[04:07.720 --> 04:09.160]  Oh, I went right off the end!
[04:09.220 --> 04:09.900]  Come on!
[04:10.900 --> 04:11.520]  Dammit!
[04:11.780 --> 04:12.280]  No!
[04:13.220 --> 04:13.700]  No!
[04:13.920 --> 04:14.040]  Oh!
[04:14.460 --> 04:15.060]  Oh my god!
[04:15.500 --> 04:16.120]  Dammit!
[04:16.240 --> 04:17.180]  It's holes!
[04:17.560 --> 04:18.140]  Holes!
[04:19.700 --> 04:20.320]  Holes!
[04:20.920 --> 04:22.140]  Holes the line!
[04:22.640 --> 04:23.040]  Die!
[04:23.380 --> 04:23.700]  No!
[04:24.020 --> 04:24.460]  Oh, we did it!
[04:25.340 --> 04:25.740]  Oh.
[04:25.780 --> 04:26.400]  Oh.
[04:26.400 --> 04:27.320]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[04:27.800 --> 04:29.360]  Gavin's way up there now.
[04:30.040 --> 04:30.480]  Oh, yeah.
[04:30.580 --> 04:31.340]  That was a good run by him.
[04:32.080 --> 04:32.460]  Wow.
[04:33.420 --> 04:33.720]  Dammit.
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.520]  How come you didn't come back?
[04:35.520 --> 04:38.500]  Just there was no, like, checkered boards, checkered line?
[04:38.920 --> 04:39.160]  Yeah.
[04:40.960 --> 04:41.640]  Oh, dammit.
[04:43.040 --> 04:43.660]  Uh, okay.
[04:43.720 --> 04:43.940]  What the?
[04:45.400 --> 04:46.120]  Oh, dang.
[04:47.340 --> 04:48.320]  Where does that end up?
[04:49.020 --> 04:49.680]  What did you do?
[04:50.140 --> 04:51.680]  Wow, this is a crazy one.
[04:52.140 --> 04:53.040]  This is hell on earth.
[04:53.060 --> 04:53.400]  Can you skip?
[04:53.400 --> 04:53.620]  What the?
[04:53.620 --> 04:54.320]  Can you just go under?
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.100]  You suck.
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.140]  Oh, you suck!
[04:56.400 --> 04:57.180]  You suck.
[04:58.420 --> 05:00.280]  Can you do, like, a Rainbow Road shortcut?
[05:01.020 --> 05:01.620]  You can try.
[05:02.180 --> 05:02.980]  Uh, it doesn't work.
[05:03.200 --> 05:03.840]  Ah, shit.
[05:03.980 --> 05:04.860]  But try it if you want.
[05:05.940 --> 05:06.720]  You try it.
[05:07.300 --> 05:07.680]  Okay.
[05:08.920 --> 05:10.060]  Oh, get away.
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.060]  Get away, please.
[05:13.740 --> 05:14.220]  Yes!
[05:14.640 --> 05:14.900]  Ow.
[05:15.140 --> 05:15.360]  Ow.
[05:15.680 --> 05:16.120]  Ow, I fell.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.080]  Yes!
[05:18.160 --> 05:18.800]  We're alive, Eric!
[05:21.460 --> 05:21.940]  Ah!
[05:22.080 --> 05:22.400]  Ah!
[05:22.540 --> 05:23.200]  I'm getting bullied!
[05:23.320 --> 05:23.540]  No!
[05:23.640 --> 05:24.340]  Oh, my God.
[05:24.720 --> 05:25.880]  I got bullied.
[05:26.140 --> 05:26.380]  I got bullied.
[05:26.380 --> 05:27.580]  Bunched to hell.
[05:27.780 --> 05:28.620]  Oh, I made it.
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.260]  You should be dead.
[05:29.340 --> 05:29.600]  Oh.
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.440]  You should be dead.
[05:30.460 --> 05:31.080]  No, now I'm gone.
[05:32.480 --> 05:32.940]  No!
[05:33.260 --> 05:33.720]  Yes!
[05:37.130 --> 05:37.910]  Out of the hole!
[05:40.290 --> 05:41.930]  Is this Gavin again?
[05:42.110 --> 05:42.330]  Yeah.
[05:42.550 --> 05:43.250]  He's good.
[05:44.770 --> 05:46.250]  How come you don't have a license?
[05:46.650 --> 05:47.050]  Oh, shit.
[05:47.950 --> 05:49.050]  Oh, my God.
[05:49.270 --> 05:50.050]  The fan!
[05:51.010 --> 05:52.250]  I bent it at the end.
[05:52.490 --> 05:52.690]  Andrew.
[05:53.930 --> 05:54.290]  Me.
[05:55.350 --> 05:55.650]  Ah!
[05:55.790 --> 05:56.130]  Ah!
[05:56.670 --> 05:57.070]  Oh.
[05:58.110 --> 05:58.870]  You're killing me.
[05:58.930 --> 05:59.810]  Yes, first place!
[06:00.210 --> 06:00.370]  Damn it.
[06:00.370 --> 06:00.770]  You're killing us.
[06:01.610 --> 06:05.090]  So, there's really no consequence at all to falling off, unless you fall off near the end.
[06:05.410 --> 06:06.090]  You lose.
[06:06.270 --> 06:07.650]  You don't get the...
[06:07.650 --> 06:08.810]  What am I trying to say?
[06:08.970 --> 06:11.350]  You get points for every checkpoint you hit.
[06:11.790 --> 06:14.690]  So, if you fall off, you don't get the points for that checkpoint.
[06:15.290 --> 06:16.050]  I see.
[06:16.330 --> 06:16.550]  Yeah.
[06:16.610 --> 06:18.230]  So, you want every checkpoint.
[06:18.670 --> 06:19.790]  You never want to fall off.
[06:20.150 --> 06:21.150]  Why couldn't I grab that?
[06:22.050 --> 06:22.690]  You suck.
[06:24.110 --> 06:25.570]  Yeah, you didn't consider that.
[06:27.350 --> 06:28.150]  What did...
[06:28.150 --> 06:30.030]  Spent my whole life considering that.
[06:31.890 --> 06:33.230]  We have a long way to go.
[06:33.390 --> 06:35.250]  We're at a level nine hype train, guys.
[06:35.410 --> 06:36.630]  Thank you so much for being here.
[06:36.670 --> 06:36.970]  Thank you.
[06:37.270 --> 06:37.390]  Y'all.
[06:37.590 --> 06:39.070]  Really appreciate everyone coming through.
[06:39.930 --> 06:40.490]  Oh, no.
[06:40.870 --> 06:41.610]  Happy holidays.
[06:41.790 --> 06:43.170]  Happy New Year to everyone out there.
[06:43.270 --> 06:44.250]  This has been a...
[06:44.250 --> 06:45.070]  It's been a really fun...
[06:45.070 --> 06:49.050]  It's been a fun year where we all lost our jobs and then started doing this, and it's been a lot of fun.
[06:50.390 --> 06:51.750]  I would say more fun.
[06:52.410 --> 06:53.130]  Yep, I agree.
[06:53.290 --> 06:54.150]  Oh, it worked!
[06:55.290 --> 06:56.110]  It worked again!
[06:56.750 --> 06:57.170]  No!
[06:59.890 --> 07:00.310]  No!
[07:01.310 --> 07:04.250]  So, no one finished on that one, so we'll all start right here.
[07:04.710 --> 07:05.730]  What does ball do?
[07:05.830 --> 07:06.830]  What does magnet ball do?
[07:07.230 --> 07:08.150]  I think it...
[07:08.150 --> 07:11.710]  I think it pushes stuff away from you if you are getting shot with something.
[07:11.990 --> 07:12.190]  Ah!
[07:12.930 --> 07:13.450]  Oh, no!
[07:13.570 --> 07:14.330]  You butts nose!
[07:14.330 --> 07:16.130]  I hit my own trap again!
[07:16.990 --> 07:17.210]  Good.
[07:17.230 --> 07:18.430]  You've killed me, you dick!
[07:21.270 --> 07:22.170]  Goo him up, Gavin!
[07:22.270 --> 07:22.710]  Goo him up!
[07:22.810 --> 07:23.110]  Goo town!
[07:23.190 --> 07:23.570]  Goo town!
[07:23.810 --> 07:25.270]  I just goo'd myself!
[07:25.370 --> 07:25.730]  I'm a...
[07:26.710 --> 07:28.310]  You're a stupid goo man!
[07:28.430 --> 07:29.270]  Fat idiot!
[07:30.210 --> 07:30.730]  No!
[07:33.090 --> 07:34.010]  Oh, let me go!
[07:34.150 --> 07:34.630]  Oh, no!
[07:35.130 --> 07:35.650]  No!
[07:37.110 --> 07:38.250]  I have lived.
[07:39.490 --> 07:42.810]  Oh, Christ.
[07:43.890 --> 07:46.230]  I lived for about eight minutes.
[07:46.430 --> 07:46.890]  Uh, seconds.
[07:47.130 --> 07:47.290]  What?
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.230]  Oh, you're so big!
[07:50.270 --> 07:51.710]  That's why I couldn't damage you with the hammer!
[07:52.230 --> 07:53.250]  Yeah, daddy's big now.
[07:53.370 --> 07:53.590]  No!
[07:54.030 --> 07:54.890]  Daddy's too big!
[07:56.570 --> 07:57.610]  Whoa, that's...
[07:57.610 --> 07:57.810]  You!
[07:59.290 --> 08:00.050]  Don't touch me!
[08:00.170 --> 08:00.830]  Don't touch me!
[08:00.830 --> 08:01.230]  Don't touch me!
[08:01.230 --> 08:01.590]  Don't touch me!
[08:01.630 --> 08:01.970]  Don't touch me!
[08:04.650 --> 08:05.610]  You've killed me!
[08:05.730 --> 08:06.490]  You dicks!
[08:07.070 --> 08:07.190]  Yes!
[08:08.430 --> 08:09.930]  Rats win again, baby!
[08:13.930 --> 08:14.450]  Yeah!
[08:14.710 --> 08:15.690]  And then!
[08:15.930 --> 08:16.850]  And then!
[08:17.410 --> 08:18.250]  And then!
[08:19.110 --> 08:19.750]  Oh, man.
[08:19.950 --> 08:20.870]  Hell yeah, baby!
[08:21.190 --> 08:21.890]  This is very close.
[08:22.290 --> 08:22.530]  Yup.
[08:23.410 --> 08:25.050]  Dude, I'm feeling a dip dinner tonight.
[08:25.730 --> 08:26.310]  Oh, yeah?
[08:26.950 --> 08:27.770]  Yeah, dip dinner.
[08:28.110 --> 08:28.950]  Nothing but dips.
[08:29.590 --> 08:30.250]  What does that mean?
[08:30.710 --> 08:31.710]  It means you're eating dips.
[08:31.810 --> 08:32.510]  It's chip dinner.
[08:33.590 --> 08:34.870]  He's eating girl dinner tonight.
[08:36.070 --> 08:36.850]  Yeah, it's just...
[08:36.850 --> 08:39.310]  I have a thing of, like, artichoke spinach dip.
[08:39.390 --> 08:40.510]  I have a thing of pimento cheese.
[08:40.550 --> 08:41.290]  And I have a thing of queso.
[08:41.630 --> 08:42.950]  Have you ever just eaten an artichoke?
[08:44.870 --> 08:45.930]  Yeah, like you cook it?
[08:46.550 --> 08:47.170]  Yeah, it's...
[08:47.170 --> 08:47.350]  Yeah?
[08:47.590 --> 08:49.250]  If you, like, pull the leaves off and then it's like a...
[08:49.250 --> 08:50.130]  What the fuck was that placement?
[08:50.130 --> 08:51.510]  You have to eat the center of them.
[08:51.630 --> 08:53.770]  I didn't know that at first, so I started nomming on the outside.
[08:55.030 --> 08:57.630]  You want to eat the heart, but then avoid the beard.
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.750]  Yeah, the beard hurts like a song bitch.
[09:04.530 --> 09:07.430]  A million dollars, but you have to eat an artichoke beard every morning.
[09:07.870 --> 09:08.830]  Oh, terrible.
[09:09.030 --> 09:09.750]  Every morning?
[09:09.870 --> 09:10.490]  I'll just die.
[09:10.910 --> 09:12.790]  The fiber you would get with that?
[09:12.970 --> 09:14.630]  Like, your shit would be insane.
[09:15.650 --> 09:17.130]  Oh, I've got goo hold.
[09:18.370 --> 09:21.170]  I was going slow and I still fell.
[09:21.910 --> 09:22.350]  Yes!
[09:23.130 --> 09:23.570]  Rats!
[09:24.230 --> 09:26.010]  Oh, you can shake the goo off?
[09:26.170 --> 09:26.270]  Yeah.
[09:27.630 --> 09:28.910]  Come on, come on!
[09:29.870 --> 09:31.230]  Someone just scratched my back.
[09:31.710 --> 09:32.530]  By the goo!
[09:33.530 --> 09:33.950]  Goo!
[09:35.130 --> 09:35.910]  Oh, shit.
[09:37.470 --> 09:39.690]  Oh, he's still in! He's still in!
[09:43.410 --> 09:45.210]  That placement was disgusting.
[09:45.650 --> 09:46.750]  Yeah, that placement sucks!
[09:48.670 --> 09:49.610]  Take my time.
[09:50.070 --> 09:52.750]  Andrew's still in it. He's not going to make it. He's not going to make it.
[09:52.750 --> 09:53.970]  He's not going to make it.
[09:54.630 --> 09:55.930]  He's not going to make it.
[09:57.250 --> 09:58.270]  See you in hell, Andrew.
[09:58.510 --> 09:59.570]  How did I die?
[09:59.830 --> 10:00.810]  How are you alive?
[10:00.950 --> 10:01.910]  Did you even come back?
[10:02.330 --> 10:03.430]  I don't think so!
[10:04.550 --> 10:05.350]  No, I'm not!
[10:07.390 --> 10:08.070]  Here we go.
[10:08.730 --> 10:09.110]  No!
[10:10.830 --> 10:12.290]  Daddy in the front. Boom, baby.
[10:13.870 --> 10:14.950]  Say hello to Papa!
[10:15.330 --> 10:15.830]  Not again!
[10:17.430 --> 10:18.810]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[10:19.810 --> 10:20.490]  You idiot!
[10:23.410 --> 10:24.130]  Oh, Tesla!
[10:28.390 --> 10:29.110]  No! Yes!
[10:29.570 --> 10:29.910]  No!
[10:29.950 --> 10:30.550]  Just beeping my phone.
[10:30.570 --> 10:31.010]  No! What?
[10:31.290 --> 10:31.650]  Yes!
[10:32.530 --> 10:32.890]  Yes!
[10:33.470 --> 10:33.830]  Yes!
[10:34.150 --> 10:36.750]  Oh, come on! Come on! Come on!
[10:37.770 --> 10:41.470]  So, Gavin, it's first to 4,000, but if more than one of us get to it, it's a...
[10:41.990 --> 10:42.430]  Sudden death.
[10:42.610 --> 10:43.830]  Yeah, sudden death. It's a lot of fun.
[10:44.430 --> 10:44.790]  Yes!
[10:46.970 --> 10:49.590]  Oh, shit. I don't know if I have enough. I have to, like...
[10:49.590 --> 10:50.350]  Oh, man.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.960]  I need more points. Give me more track.
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.380]  Weigh in options.
[10:57.560 --> 10:58.020]  No!
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.040]  Oh, God, Andrew.
[11:03.640 --> 11:06.700]  I added track. I didn't mess up the course.
[11:06.920 --> 11:07.340]  Okay.
[11:07.660 --> 11:08.720]  I messed up the course.
[11:09.180 --> 11:10.000]  Oh, you did?
[11:10.200 --> 11:10.320]  Yeah.
[11:10.400 --> 11:10.960]  I gotta lock in.
[11:11.520 --> 11:12.700]  Oh, no touchy.
[11:12.960 --> 11:14.620]  No, you piece of shit!
[11:15.420 --> 11:18.140]  Oh, what a shot!
[11:18.600 --> 11:19.240]  He missed.
[11:20.480 --> 11:21.760]  It didn't look like I missed.
[11:22.480 --> 11:23.200]  Eh, it felt like it.
[11:23.980 --> 11:25.600]  God damn it again!
[11:26.420 --> 11:27.340]  Silly twat!
[11:28.920 --> 11:29.800]  I'm goo'd!
[11:31.760 --> 11:32.640]  You guys!
[11:32.820 --> 11:33.220]  I killed everyone!
[11:33.440 --> 11:33.820]  No one.
[11:37.080 --> 11:38.800]  Oh, there's goo right in front of my wheel.
[11:39.940 --> 11:40.380]  Somebody...
[11:40.380 --> 11:44.260]  Coffee break in the chat just said Gavin did better before he understood that the game won.
[11:45.960 --> 11:46.400]  No!
[11:46.960 --> 11:47.500]  God damn it.
[11:47.600 --> 11:48.140]  Oh, I needed that.
[11:48.460 --> 11:50.180]  Why did it spawn me upside down?
[11:51.480 --> 11:52.480]  You died that way.
[11:55.420 --> 11:56.300]  The hole!
[12:00.460 --> 12:01.020]  Oh!
[12:03.280 --> 12:03.840]  Oh!
[12:04.880 --> 12:05.440]  Oh!
[12:05.680 --> 12:06.760]  I didn't make it!
[12:07.460 --> 12:09.840]  Dude, that spot is hell on earth.
[12:10.620 --> 12:11.780]  What the fuck?
[12:12.000 --> 12:12.880]  Oh, come on!
[12:12.900 --> 12:13.660]  I'm not on it!
[12:13.720 --> 12:14.240]  Bullshit!
[12:14.240 --> 12:16.840]  Oh, I really need you guys to keep doing what you're doing.
[12:17.080 --> 12:19.540]  These freaking hairpin fan holes.
[12:19.940 --> 12:20.820]  I hate it.
[12:22.640 --> 12:24.320]  Watch out for the fan hole.
[12:24.680 --> 12:24.940]  Ah!
[12:26.200 --> 12:27.100]  Oh, God!
[12:27.100 --> 12:28.080]  My own weapons!
[12:29.420 --> 12:30.940]  Oh, I didn't even get to come back.
[12:31.600 --> 12:33.220]  You boosted me off!
[12:36.140 --> 12:37.040]  Sorry, fellas.
[12:37.220 --> 12:38.080]  Had to be done.
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.220]  Uh-oh.
[12:42.240 --> 12:43.360]  Get me out of here.
[12:43.940 --> 12:45.320]  Get me out of here!
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.240]  Ow!
[12:47.220 --> 12:48.000]  Where did I go?
[12:50.020 --> 12:50.500]  Andrew.
[12:50.960 --> 12:51.120]  Yeah?
[12:51.660 --> 12:52.160]  No touchy.
[12:52.840 --> 12:53.140]  Hit him.
[12:53.320 --> 12:53.620]  Hit him!
[12:53.740 --> 12:54.060]  Hit him!
[12:55.400 --> 12:56.420]  Oh, he's large.
[12:57.280 --> 12:58.480]  And in charge!
[12:59.200 --> 12:59.760]  Oh, my God.
[12:59.820 --> 13:01.140]  This is the worst run of my life.
[13:01.660 --> 13:03.180]  The worst run of my life!
[13:03.420 --> 13:03.960]  Get me the...
[13:04.620 --> 13:04.900]  Fuck.
[13:04.980 --> 13:05.460]  Oh!
[13:06.360 --> 13:07.480]  I blew it.
[13:07.640 --> 13:08.300]  I blew it.
[13:08.420 --> 13:09.320]  I blew the whole thing.
[13:09.600 --> 13:10.280]  Have I done it?
[13:10.380 --> 13:11.460]  I blew the whole thing.
[13:12.120 --> 13:12.620]  Have I done it?
[13:12.720 --> 13:13.660]  Oh, Nick wins!
[13:14.420 --> 13:15.280]  Come on, Andrew.
[13:15.280 --> 13:15.680]  Catch up.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.020]  No!
[13:16.880 --> 13:17.360]  No!
[13:17.660 --> 13:18.060]  No!
[13:18.180 --> 13:19.280]  Your first play point!
[13:19.420 --> 13:20.060]  Stop me!
[13:20.440 --> 13:21.500]  Your first play point!
[13:22.980 --> 13:23.800]  Dammit, Gavin!
[13:24.900 --> 13:26.260]  Oh, my God.
[13:26.960 --> 13:27.400]  Wow!
[13:28.040 --> 13:29.580]  Oh, your first place points!
[13:31.360 --> 13:31.800]  Wow!
[13:32.520 --> 13:32.960]  Wow!
[13:33.740 --> 13:35.120]  I can't believe it!
[13:36.060 --> 13:36.500]  Dude.
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.000]  This is crazy.
[13:39.020 --> 13:39.980]  Let me do this.
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.460]  Oh, my God.
[13:43.420 --> 13:49.660]  And now, when you level up, you get more stuff that you can unlock to place on the course, but you also get more cars.
[13:50.280 --> 13:51.780]  But the different cars don't do anything.
[13:51.960 --> 13:53.300]  It's just a thing to look at.
[13:53.560 --> 13:53.920]  They just look wicked.
[13:54.300 --> 13:55.620]  Yeah, as it flies off the edge.
[13:55.620 --> 14:00.400]  I just unlocked a track hazard called the Swinging Big Sax.
[14:00.900 --> 14:01.640]  Hell yeah.
[14:03.180 --> 14:05.240]  And the Municipal Van, which I will be using.
[14:05.780 --> 14:06.560]  So, that's pretty good.
[14:07.020 --> 14:07.760]  Thank you.
[14:08.480 --> 14:09.240]  Thank you.
[14:09.480 --> 14:10.280]  Comment leavers and friends.
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.420]  I unlocked the Jar of Smallpox.
[14:12.940 --> 14:13.620]  Oh, very nice.
[14:13.680 --> 14:14.080]  Oh, nice.
[14:15.860 --> 14:16.300]  What?
[14:16.760 --> 14:17.880]  Okay, you guys ready for another one?
[14:17.980 --> 14:18.300]  I'm ready.
[14:18.680 --> 14:18.780]  We'll do the same mode.
[14:18.840 --> 14:19.720]  We'll do the classic mode.
[14:20.820 --> 14:21.600]  Is it the same map?
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.480]  I mean, yeah.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.640]  You build the map.
[14:25.820 --> 14:26.580]  You build the map.
[14:26.900 --> 14:27.880]  Well, the same environment?
[14:28.720 --> 14:29.060]  No.
[14:30.480 --> 14:31.800]  I think sometimes.
[14:31.900 --> 14:32.800]  I'm not sure how to change it.
[14:32.880 --> 14:33.380]  Or if you can.
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.740]  Guys, I gotta pick the Falcon, right?
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.160]  Go for it.
[14:37.220 --> 14:37.620]  Pick the Falcon.
[14:38.400 --> 14:38.820]  I'll be red.
[14:43.890 --> 14:45.690]  Oh, I'm feeling good about...
[14:45.690 --> 14:46.070]  Ooh!
[14:47.070 --> 14:47.950]  I want this one.
[14:51.570 --> 14:51.970]  Alright.
[14:52.910 --> 14:53.310]  Boom.
[14:53.850 --> 14:54.970]  Easy turns at the beginning.
[14:55.490 --> 14:55.750]  Simple.
[14:56.130 --> 14:57.390]  Ooh, corkscrew to start.
[14:57.690 --> 14:58.290]  I like it.
[14:58.790 --> 15:00.070]  Oh, we're having a good time.
[15:00.490 --> 15:01.850]  Having a good time.
[15:04.930 --> 15:05.970]  I'm red this time.
[15:06.310 --> 15:07.450]  Oh, my God.
[15:08.810 --> 15:09.330]  Early ramp.
[15:09.750 --> 15:10.130]  Whoa!
[15:12.750 --> 15:13.270]  No!
[15:13.790 --> 15:14.170]  Oh, shit.
[15:16.010 --> 15:17.050]  Oh, cock!
[15:20.600 --> 15:21.740]  No, I'm the goo!
[15:22.160 --> 15:25.180]  I wish I still didn't understand it so I could do well again.
[15:26.740 --> 15:27.700]  Those were the days.
[15:28.820 --> 15:29.160]  Oh!
[15:30.460 --> 15:30.800]  Yes!
[15:31.100 --> 15:32.040]  Goddammit, I didn't get first.
[15:32.360 --> 15:32.400]  Fuck.
[15:36.820 --> 15:37.160]  Piss.
[15:38.040 --> 15:38.380]  Dammit.
[15:39.400 --> 15:41.580]  Is the audio too low on this for the game?
[15:42.000 --> 15:42.740]  Let me know, audio.
[15:42.840 --> 15:43.220]  Let me know.
[15:43.500 --> 15:46.080]  I wouldn't want to miss out on sounds of me fooling in holes.
[15:48.860 --> 15:49.780]  What did I pick up?
[15:49.920 --> 15:50.260]  What is this?
[15:51.540 --> 15:52.080]  There we go.
[15:52.280 --> 15:52.900]  Oh, it was all good.
[15:52.980 --> 15:53.080]  Okay.
[15:53.420 --> 15:53.840]  Let's see.
[15:53.980 --> 15:54.060]  Okay.
[15:55.060 --> 15:56.480]  Is that a boost pad?
[15:56.820 --> 15:57.800]  Yeah, boost pad.
[15:59.980 --> 16:01.060]  Oh, my God.
[16:01.140 --> 16:02.080]  Oh, that's terrible.
[16:02.420 --> 16:03.340]  What are you doing?
[16:03.880 --> 16:04.360]  That's terrible.
[16:04.600 --> 16:05.280]  Oh, my God.
[16:06.280 --> 16:06.940]  Oh, no.
[16:07.060 --> 16:09.240]  Oh, you suck ass.
[16:09.560 --> 16:10.840]  Go fast, Eos.
[16:11.980 --> 16:12.960]  As they say.
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.960]  My siren's on.
[16:15.460 --> 16:16.260]  I can tell.
[16:17.160 --> 16:18.880]  What the hell was that?
[16:19.020 --> 16:20.620]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[16:20.880 --> 16:23.400]  You goo'd me out of the gate, you prick.
[16:26.140 --> 16:27.340]  Uh-oh.
[16:28.600 --> 16:29.380]  Uh-oh.
[16:30.540 --> 16:32.300]  Who's the little ambulance?
[16:32.300 --> 16:33.160]  It's me, baby.
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.020]  The whambulance.
[16:35.060 --> 16:35.560]  Oh, shit.
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.140]  Ah!
[16:37.480 --> 16:37.780]  Ah!
[16:37.880 --> 16:38.180]  Woo!
[16:42.850 --> 16:44.930]  You hit me so hard.
[16:45.250 --> 16:47.170]  I live and I win.
[16:48.430 --> 16:49.430]  That's going to put you in first.
[16:50.110 --> 16:50.390]  No?
[16:54.690 --> 16:56.190]  Oh, that's close.
[16:56.290 --> 16:56.950]  And Gavin's got one of those.
[16:57.550 --> 17:00.450]  If you bet on Gavin, Curious, how you feeling?
[17:00.910 --> 17:06.470]  Apologies for those who count on me weakly.
[17:06.810 --> 17:07.590]  There we go.
[17:10.010 --> 17:11.730]  What the fuck is that thing?
[17:12.130 --> 17:13.150]  Oh, see you in hell, bud.
[17:14.770 --> 17:15.690]  Oh, no.
[17:15.930 --> 17:16.910]  Gavin, what you got?
[17:17.110 --> 17:17.310]  Gavin!
[17:17.810 --> 17:19.790]  Stop putting everything at the beginning.
[17:20.470 --> 17:20.850]  Gavin!
[17:25.840 --> 17:26.980]  Oh, my God.
[17:27.920 --> 17:28.540]  Uh...
[17:30.440 --> 17:32.540]  Where did I go there?
[17:33.120 --> 17:35.540]  It was like the magic trick.
[17:36.000 --> 17:36.800]  Right off the edge.
[17:38.260 --> 17:38.400]  Ow.
[17:39.940 --> 17:41.080]  Dammit, dammit.
[17:41.280 --> 17:41.500]  Gavin?
[17:41.900 --> 17:42.460]  Sweet Gavin!
[17:43.040 --> 17:43.320]  No.
[17:43.400 --> 17:44.540]  Gavin, don't touch it.
[17:47.580 --> 17:48.660]  You prick!
[17:49.120 --> 17:50.480]  You little fuck!
[17:50.900 --> 17:51.340]  You suck.
[17:51.940 --> 17:52.360]  Andrew!
[17:53.160 --> 17:55.040]  What do you mean it was him? I was dead!
[17:55.340 --> 17:55.820]  Oh, my God.
[17:55.820 --> 17:56.340]  You killed me!
[17:56.340 --> 17:57.020]  You suck.
[17:59.900 --> 18:00.540]  Ow.
[18:00.900 --> 18:01.800]  Oh, you got me!
[18:02.260 --> 18:03.700]  You worthless fuck!
[18:03.980 --> 18:06.060]  Who put not a railing there?
[18:08.900 --> 18:12.000]  Wait until we play chaos mode where there's no railings anywhere.
[18:12.240 --> 18:13.060]  Oh, God.
[18:13.500 --> 18:14.440]  Oh, God!
[18:14.580 --> 18:15.080]  Oh, railing.
[18:16.380 --> 18:17.020]  No!
[18:17.800 --> 18:19.200]  Oh, come on.
[18:20.180 --> 18:20.900]  Oh, pipe.
[18:22.700 --> 18:23.740]  I finished!
[18:26.340 --> 18:27.340]  Good for you, bud.
[18:27.700 --> 18:28.940]  God damn bad.
[18:30.820 --> 18:32.580]  Can I get out of lost?
[18:32.700 --> 18:33.040]  No.
[18:33.440 --> 18:34.280]  Wow, we're tied.
[18:34.440 --> 18:34.820]  Crazy.
[18:35.480 --> 18:36.300]  First, first, third, third.
[18:36.880 --> 18:37.100]  Yep.
[18:38.440 --> 18:39.840]  Another half pipe for sure.
[18:40.280 --> 18:41.380]  Didn't mean to grab that.
[18:43.000 --> 18:43.560]  Whoops.
[18:43.960 --> 18:44.240]  Doodle.
[18:44.320 --> 18:44.820]  This one?
[18:45.620 --> 18:46.560]  This one?
[18:47.200 --> 18:48.240]  You got one second.
[18:48.630 --> 18:50.960]  Boop, boop, boop, boop.
[18:53.500 --> 18:54.280]  Boom.
[18:59.460 --> 19:01.740]  Wow, that's pretty higgledy.
[19:04.600 --> 19:05.380]  Higgledy.
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.000]  Here we go!
[19:06.900 --> 19:08.800]  Can you animal?
[19:09.380 --> 19:09.780]  Shit.
[19:10.560 --> 19:11.380]  Oh, yes!
[19:12.220 --> 19:12.740]  Boom, baby.
[19:13.260 --> 19:14.420]  Get off my crib!
[19:15.160 --> 19:18.980]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[19:19.000 --> 19:19.420]  You got good.
[19:19.520 --> 19:20.280]  Damn it.
[19:20.380 --> 19:20.960]  I got good.
[19:22.900 --> 19:24.000]  No touchy, no touchy.
[19:24.240 --> 19:24.960]  You're touching me.
[19:25.240 --> 19:26.340]  You're touching me.
[19:26.520 --> 19:27.640]  Touching you.
[19:28.700 --> 19:28.760]  No!
[19:35.600 --> 19:36.680]  Don't, Eric!
[19:37.660 --> 19:38.860]  You tossed me.
[19:39.060 --> 19:41.140]  Eric, Eric, Eric.
[19:42.260 --> 19:43.520]  Oh, damn it.
[19:44.500 --> 19:46.180]  I got so turned around.
[19:49.320 --> 19:49.800]  Wow.
[19:51.300 --> 19:53.200]  I used the rocket to save my ass.
[19:54.180 --> 19:54.660]  No!
[19:55.300 --> 19:57.080]  I went too hard on the half pipe.
[19:58.240 --> 19:59.620]  The half pipe of doom.
[20:00.740 --> 20:01.820]  That was a half pipe.
[20:03.700 --> 20:04.180]  Yes!
[20:04.840 --> 20:05.240]  Damn it.
[20:05.520 --> 20:06.880]  I stopped just short of the end.
[20:06.900 --> 20:08.160]  I don't think you finished.
[20:08.960 --> 20:10.620]  Son of a bitch.
[20:12.240 --> 20:12.580]  Oh!
[20:13.840 --> 20:14.520]  Yes!
[20:15.640 --> 20:16.180]  Oh, doggie.
[20:16.180 --> 20:16.260]  Woo!
[20:16.500 --> 20:17.320]  Getting there.
[20:17.740 --> 20:20.020]  Andrew, we're still tied for first.
[20:20.400 --> 20:21.420]  What is this?
[20:29.030 --> 20:30.590]  Oh, is this the highway?
[20:32.170 --> 20:33.110]  Is it like this?
[20:33.270 --> 20:33.450]  Yeah.
[20:33.630 --> 20:34.850]  This freeway fucking sucks.
[20:36.150 --> 20:36.830]  Gavin.
[20:36.990 --> 20:37.310]  Gavin!
[20:38.190 --> 20:39.790]  What the fuck?
[20:40.530 --> 20:41.210]  Gavin.
[20:41.370 --> 20:41.610]  Why?
[20:42.310 --> 20:42.810]  Why?
[20:42.810 --> 20:43.610]  You menace!
[20:44.140 --> 20:48.990]  Oh, don't touch it!
[20:48.990 --> 20:49.410]  Oh!
[20:49.750 --> 20:50.290]  Oh!
[20:50.470 --> 20:50.810]  Ow.
[20:51.090 --> 20:51.330]  Oh!
[20:52.490 --> 20:53.030]  Hold!
[20:54.410 --> 20:54.950]  Wow.
[20:55.410 --> 20:55.910]  I live.
[20:56.770 --> 20:57.090]  No!
[20:57.790 --> 20:57.830]  Oh, god.
[20:57.830 --> 20:57.870]  The goo.
[20:57.870 --> 20:57.990]  The goo.
[20:58.590 --> 20:58.990]  Shortcut.
[21:02.430 --> 21:03.870]  You killed yourself.
[21:04.150 --> 21:04.550]  I did.
[21:07.210 --> 21:07.750]  No!
[21:09.010 --> 21:10.430]  I tried to avoid the hole.
[21:10.550 --> 21:11.410]  Oh, my god!
[21:11.450 --> 21:12.010]  I got him!
[21:12.210 --> 21:13.590]  That was a snipe and a hop.
[21:13.590 --> 21:14.830]  Run in!
[21:14.950 --> 21:16.410]  How is he alive still?
[21:16.510 --> 21:16.990]  He lived.
[21:17.070 --> 21:17.490]  He lived.
[21:17.550 --> 21:17.970]  He lived.
[21:18.030 --> 21:18.410]  He lived.
[21:18.530 --> 21:18.830]  He lived.
[21:18.910 --> 21:20.050]  Stop touching me!
[21:20.890 --> 21:21.230]  Yes!
[21:21.730 --> 21:24.830]  You slam right into me while saying, stop touching me.
[21:25.330 --> 21:26.670]  You touched me first.
[21:30.230 --> 21:30.330]  Oh!
[21:30.990 --> 21:31.110]  Oh!
[21:31.530 --> 21:32.610]  God, man.
[21:33.230 --> 21:33.450]  No!
[21:36.450 --> 21:37.110]  Stay in.
[21:37.170 --> 21:37.450]  Stay in.
[21:37.450 --> 21:37.690]  Stay in.
[21:37.690 --> 21:38.110]  Tease the rail.
[21:39.630 --> 21:40.590]  Stay in!
[21:41.770 --> 21:45.530]  I don't know where the track is going and I'm scared to look at it.
[21:49.900 --> 21:51.120]  Alright, what's next?
[21:55.000 --> 21:55.900]  Come on.
[21:56.500 --> 21:57.100]  Highway!
[21:57.480 --> 21:57.600]  Oh, the highway!
[21:59.000 --> 21:59.600]  No!
[22:01.780 --> 22:02.980]  No, I'm finished.
[22:04.020 --> 22:05.540]  The highway saved us all.
[22:05.700 --> 22:06.140]  Oh, my god.
[22:07.920 --> 22:08.360]  Move!
[22:08.460 --> 22:08.920]  I'm an ambulance!
[22:09.380 --> 22:10.720]  Oh, my god!
[22:10.800 --> 22:11.080]  No!
[22:11.180 --> 22:11.720]  The car!
[22:12.420 --> 22:12.980]  Yes!
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.280]  Oh, you made it!
[22:15.780 --> 22:16.340]  Oh, achievement.
[22:19.280 --> 22:19.880]  Slipstream.
[22:19.880 --> 22:20.860]  Slipstream over 100 kilometers.
[22:21.280 --> 22:21.640]  Wow.
[22:21.800 --> 22:23.200]  No, no, no.
[22:23.620 --> 22:24.820]  Is this slipstreaming?
[22:25.400 --> 22:25.760]  Apparently.
[22:27.020 --> 22:27.380]  Yes!
[22:27.980 --> 22:28.340]  Oh!
[22:29.860 --> 22:31.200]  Man, it's such a close game.
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.240]  Why'd you say it like that?
[22:38.220 --> 22:39.160]  Can I do it this way?
[22:39.560 --> 22:39.920]  Yeah.
[22:42.100 --> 22:44.480]  Alright, who do you have your, uh, who got your money on chat?
[22:45.000 --> 22:45.620]  We doing bets?
[22:45.700 --> 22:46.160]  How's it looking?
[22:46.700 --> 22:47.040]  Yeah.
[22:50.080 --> 22:52.740]  You can just give the winner the money directly.
[22:53.800 --> 22:54.280]  Ooh.
[22:54.740 --> 22:55.940]  What the hell is that?
[22:56.500 --> 22:57.760]  Is it going backwards?
[22:58.500 --> 22:59.640]  It might be.
[23:03.120 --> 23:04.080]  Oh, no.
[23:04.760 --> 23:05.840]  Stay in, stay in, stay in, stay in.
[23:05.840 --> 23:06.500]  God damn it.
[23:06.720 --> 23:07.300]  Damn it.
[23:07.560 --> 23:08.260]  Nope, nope, nope.
[23:08.360 --> 23:08.780]  Okay, I'm in.
[23:10.840 --> 23:11.200]  Oh!
[23:11.780 --> 23:12.080]  Ah!
[23:16.520 --> 23:17.000]  No!
[23:17.540 --> 23:18.020]  No!
[23:19.240 --> 23:19.720]  Oh!
[23:22.380 --> 23:22.860]  Oh!
[23:24.120 --> 23:25.200]  Stay under the hole!
[23:25.380 --> 23:25.520]  Oh.
[23:27.200 --> 23:28.900]  The hole calls to you, Eric.
[23:28.960 --> 23:31.100]  I finally got, I finally didn't fall in it.
[23:31.440 --> 23:32.460]  Oh, shit!
[23:33.660 --> 23:35.440]  I slipped under that perfectly.
[23:36.640 --> 23:38.860]  No, you worthless shit!
[23:39.200 --> 23:39.960]  Oh, god damn it.
[23:40.140 --> 23:40.620]  No!
[23:40.660 --> 23:41.220]  Oh, wheels!
[23:41.700 --> 23:42.460]  I mean, wheels win.
[23:43.820 --> 23:45.280]  Oh, Gavin has the mines.
[23:46.960 --> 23:47.340]  Amoria!
[23:48.860 --> 23:49.340]  Cool!
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.220]  I thought I ran out of mines and I just started going beep, beep, beep, beep.
[23:53.720 --> 23:54.160]  No!
[23:54.760 --> 23:55.520]  Still in.
[23:55.780 --> 23:57.220]  You're alive, how are you alive?
[23:57.240 --> 23:57.520]  No!
[23:58.120 --> 23:58.400]  No!
[23:59.300 --> 23:59.780]  No!
[24:00.320 --> 24:00.800]  Bullshit!
[24:00.800 --> 24:02.680]  How does he keep all his wheels on?
[24:02.820 --> 24:04.480]  It's because that car is bullshit.
[24:04.800 --> 24:05.340]  It's weighted.
[24:07.060 --> 24:07.680]  He's got countless.
[24:07.900 --> 24:08.500]  They are different.
[24:08.720 --> 24:08.900]  Hey!
[24:09.100 --> 24:09.560]  Hey!
[24:09.860 --> 24:10.100]  Hey!
[24:11.200 --> 24:11.680]  Freeway!
[24:12.620 --> 24:12.920]  Oh!
[24:16.320 --> 24:16.800]  Gavin?
[24:17.140 --> 24:17.300]  Yeah?
[24:17.440 --> 24:18.100]  We need to work together.
[24:18.100 --> 24:18.560]  Okay.
[24:21.220 --> 24:22.480]  Is that what it was?
[24:22.480 --> 24:22.860]  I didn't do it, Gavin.
[24:24.220 --> 24:24.700]  Yes!
[24:24.960 --> 24:25.060]  Finish!
[24:27.260 --> 24:29.300]  Why is that just a straight up gun?
[24:29.840 --> 24:30.520]  For the win!
[24:32.560 --> 24:33.640]  Oh, my god.
[24:33.800 --> 24:34.660]  Oh, my god.
[24:35.640 --> 24:36.740]  For the win!
[24:38.440 --> 24:38.920]  Oh!
[24:39.100 --> 24:39.480]  No!
[24:40.100 --> 24:40.320]  Yes!
[24:40.680 --> 24:41.720]  Holy shit!
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.480]  Okay, so it's just these two.
[24:43.480 --> 24:43.780]  Here we go!
[24:44.060 --> 24:46.160]  You go until you fall off.
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.280]  Get ready to Venmo the winner.
[24:53.760 --> 24:54.140]  Who?
[24:54.680 --> 24:55.180]  He died first.
[24:55.300 --> 24:55.900]  He died first.
[24:56.700 --> 24:57.080]  Yeah!
[24:57.460 --> 24:57.780]  What?
[24:58.860 --> 24:59.120]  No!
[24:59.980 --> 25:00.400]  Yeah!
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.440]  The winner wins!
[25:04.040 --> 25:05.480]  Give me the rat coins!
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.700]  He's got a secret power shoe or something.
[25:10.520 --> 25:11.840]  That's bullshit!
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.200]  I can't fucking believe this!
[25:15.740 --> 25:16.140]  Andrew!
[25:16.140 --> 25:17.260]  Andrew wins!
[25:17.680 --> 25:19.420]  He's paying off the devs!
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.980]  He fell off before I did!
[25:25.480 --> 25:25.700]  How?
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.380]  Gavin, do you want to play the regular mode again or do you want to go into chaos mode?
[25:32.080 --> 25:33.760]  What about one more regular than a chaos?
[25:33.920 --> 25:35.100]  Sounds good to me.
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.120]  What the?
[25:36.380 --> 25:37.200]  Oh, there's my phone.
[25:38.320 --> 25:39.840]  Oh, there's my phone.
[25:40.900 --> 25:42.260]  I thought my kid ran off with it.
[25:42.380 --> 25:42.780]  Yeah, he did.
[25:42.940 --> 25:43.740]  I can't believe it!
[25:45.060 --> 25:50.080]  What makes it weirder is your kid lied about where it went in a different way and they didn't take it.
[25:50.400 --> 25:52.340]  He's been taking shit and just hiding it.
[25:52.520 --> 25:53.460]  Did you take this?
[25:53.700 --> 25:54.060]  No.
[25:54.120 --> 25:54.340]  No.
[25:55.540 --> 25:57.400]  To be fair, I took some shit when I was there earlier.
[25:57.840 --> 26:00.780]  Guys, get your bets in now!
[26:01.720 --> 26:03.280]  Oh, you better bet for the back to back.
[26:03.980 --> 26:04.600]  This is great.
[26:05.880 --> 26:08.060]  You don't bet for the back to back, you're just losing your rat coin.
[26:08.780 --> 26:09.820]  Lightning can't strike twice.
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.920]  Well, if you're thinking about betting for Nick, I would strongly advise against it.
[26:16.140 --> 26:17.080]  I would do it.
[26:17.500 --> 26:17.860]  Nick's pissed.
[26:20.280 --> 26:20.720]  Mammoth.
[26:22.200 --> 26:24.780]  Oh, this thing's called Cotton Mouth? That's sick.
[26:26.940 --> 26:27.380]  Cool.
[26:27.560 --> 26:27.780]  Which one?
[26:28.080 --> 26:28.960]  Gavin, what do you think?
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.480]  Do you want to play the video game?
[26:31.820 --> 26:32.120]  Who, me?
[26:33.080 --> 26:33.420]  Yes.
[26:36.440 --> 26:37.300]  No, Gavin.
[26:38.940 --> 26:39.800]  It's been a long time.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.240]  I'm going for C.
[26:43.300 --> 26:44.500]  I'm going for A.
[26:51.440 --> 26:55.060]  We have to build the track before we can make it insane.
[26:57.140 --> 26:57.660]  Why?
[26:58.940 --> 27:01.600]  Is this accurate to where I'm starting?
[27:02.640 --> 27:03.200]  What do you mean?
[27:03.620 --> 27:04.820]  Like, am I starting right there?
[27:04.920 --> 27:05.760]  I don't know, maybe.
[27:07.420 --> 27:08.520]  You're a prick.
[27:11.880 --> 27:12.920]  Ten seconds.
[27:12.920 --> 27:14.320]  Why is it sucking it?
[27:16.460 --> 27:16.860]  You're...
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.080]  It's a tight start, guys.
[27:21.160 --> 27:22.680]  Oh no, I'm also on the right.
[27:24.840 --> 27:25.860]  Oh god, it worked!
[27:25.860 --> 27:26.360]  God damn it!
[27:26.460 --> 27:26.940]  It worked!
[27:29.380 --> 27:30.340]  He's gonna die!
[27:31.820 --> 27:34.140]  Why was the camera trying to eat me? There's no one else here!
[27:38.080 --> 27:40.200]  That was a real taste of Iron Betty's.
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.020]  Oh my god!
[27:44.480 --> 27:45.320]  Wow, that was...
[27:46.680 --> 27:48.860]  You're a monster.
[27:53.480 --> 27:56.000]  Did everybody pick obstacles?
[27:56.660 --> 27:58.340]  We have one checkpoint.
[27:58.720 --> 27:59.000]  We do.
[27:59.780 --> 28:00.660]  We do.
[28:01.460 --> 28:02.760]  We have one checkpoint.
[28:07.100 --> 28:08.140]  Guys!
[28:08.820 --> 28:10.840]  We have one checkpoint.
[28:11.840 --> 28:12.320]  That's rough.
[28:13.340 --> 28:13.980]  Gavin, you're on the right.
[28:14.060 --> 28:14.580]  I'm on the wrong side!
[28:17.680 --> 28:18.320]  No!
[28:20.200 --> 28:21.180]  Come on!
[28:21.680 --> 28:22.160]  Oh no!
[28:24.840 --> 28:26.380]  It's gone Mickey Mouse again.
[28:29.060 --> 28:29.980]  Nicky Mouse?
[28:31.040 --> 28:32.040]  Fuck yeah!
[28:32.460 --> 28:33.560]  You suck.
[28:34.140 --> 28:34.920]  What was that?
[28:35.300 --> 28:36.840]  I heard Nicky Mouse and I laughed.
[28:38.680 --> 28:40.280]  Why am I turned sideways?
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.580]  Why didn't you try to straighten out?
[28:43.920 --> 28:44.800]  I'm still in it!
[28:44.840 --> 28:45.520]  I'm out!
[28:45.700 --> 28:46.980]  Why am I turning all wrong?
[28:47.340 --> 28:48.500]  Son of a bitch.
[28:48.920 --> 28:49.980]  Nick is back.
[28:52.120 --> 28:54.120]  Sticky Mouse, Sticky Mouse, Sticky Mouse.
[28:54.440 --> 28:55.620]  No, shut the fuck up!
[29:01.300 --> 29:02.440]  Alright, we're back boys!
[29:05.360 --> 29:06.320]  First place!
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.660]  Back to back!
[29:17.200 --> 29:19.880]  I'm sweating so bad right now.
[29:24.740 --> 29:26.180]  Gavin, Gavin.
[29:26.700 --> 29:27.640]  Can I help you with something?
[29:28.860 --> 29:32.260]  Ultimate chicken horse ass fucking look at this shit.
[29:32.560 --> 29:34.480]  Yeah, this felt familiar.
[29:34.480 --> 29:35.840]  Where's that son of a bitch?
[29:36.960 --> 29:37.820]  Hey, what was in that?
[29:38.640 --> 29:39.680]  Oh my god.
[29:40.540 --> 29:42.540]  I'm on the wrong side of the road!
[29:44.260 --> 29:44.680]  No!
[29:45.140 --> 29:46.320]  Oh, you dickhead!
[29:46.740 --> 29:48.480]  Oh shit, I've got all the wrongs.
[29:48.560 --> 29:49.800]  I'm doing wrong.
[29:50.520 --> 29:50.960]  Come on.
[29:51.460 --> 29:52.060]  Come on.
[29:52.380 --> 29:53.040]  Hey, hey, hey.
[29:53.100 --> 29:54.390]  I'm doing all the wrong, I'm doing wrong.
[29:55.140 --> 29:55.760]  Nicky Mouse.
[29:55.980 --> 29:56.460]  You got this Gavin.
[29:56.940 --> 29:57.520]  You got this.
[29:58.340 --> 29:59.120]  Yeah, you can't do it.
[29:59.180 --> 29:59.620]  You can't do it.
[29:59.620 --> 30:01.660]  You suck, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck.
[30:01.660 --> 30:02.500]  I do suck.
[30:02.600 --> 30:03.460]  I do suck.
[30:04.400 --> 30:05.040]  No!
[30:07.940 --> 30:09.100]  Now I'm finished.
[30:09.360 --> 30:10.600]  None of it meant anything!
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.480]  Why am I all skew-whiffed?
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.880]  Oh, cock!
[30:16.340 --> 30:17.300]  My own shit!
[30:20.000 --> 30:20.520]  I'm alive!
[30:23.360 --> 30:24.420]  Stop whacking!
[30:27.560 --> 30:28.200]  No!
[30:29.560 --> 30:31.360]  I was going so slowly, so careful.
[30:31.360 --> 30:32.800]  Oh, I got so turned around.
[30:32.800 --> 30:34.360]  I was being so careful.
[30:37.000 --> 30:37.900]  I made it.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.160]  I'm back, baby.
[30:41.200 --> 30:41.680]  Ow!
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.000]  Gun, gun, gun.
[30:43.320 --> 30:44.520]  Gun, gun, gun, gun.
[30:46.240 --> 30:47.580]  Son of a bitch!
[30:50.040 --> 30:50.520]  No!
[30:51.240 --> 30:52.140]  Get off my ass.
[30:52.780 --> 30:53.220]  Get off me.
[30:53.580 --> 30:53.920]  Yes!
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.100]  I thought that was the end.
[30:55.720 --> 30:56.440]  I thought it was too.
[30:56.980 --> 30:57.360]  No!
[30:57.400 --> 30:57.660]  No!
[30:58.060 --> 30:58.540]  No!
[31:00.480 --> 31:00.960]  Rats!
[31:05.740 --> 31:06.220]  Yes!
[31:06.560 --> 31:07.040]  Shit.
[31:07.580 --> 31:07.720]  Yes!
[31:08.980 --> 31:09.460]  Oh.
[31:09.620 --> 31:10.580]  Oh, rats.
[31:13.160 --> 31:14.320]  Oh, God, the game.
[31:15.400 --> 31:16.860]  I don't even know what I picked.
[31:17.960 --> 31:19.320]  Oh, this is going to be hell.
[31:19.520 --> 31:20.120]  Oh, God.
[31:20.380 --> 31:20.580]  Okay.
[31:21.840 --> 31:23.540]  Guys, it's a really narrow road.
[31:24.680 --> 31:25.940]  Where's the goddamn start?
[31:27.400 --> 31:28.140]  Right there.
[31:28.600 --> 31:28.920]  Oh, yeah.
[31:29.500 --> 31:30.400]  You suck.
[31:30.900 --> 31:31.980]  You piece of shit.
[31:32.180 --> 31:32.640]  You suck.
[31:35.840 --> 31:38.360]  The rest is such a cakewalk compared to this, too.
[31:38.380 --> 31:39.240]  I know.
[31:39.700 --> 31:41.280]  Once you get past this starting bit.
[31:41.400 --> 31:41.700]  Ah!
[31:45.680 --> 31:46.480]  All right.
[31:46.600 --> 31:46.920]  Nice and easy.
[31:46.920 --> 31:47.340]  What is that?
[31:47.480 --> 31:48.000]  What have you got there?
[31:49.140 --> 31:49.500]  Oh!
[31:49.900 --> 31:50.420]  It's a gun.
[31:50.680 --> 31:51.040]  It's a gun.
[31:51.420 --> 31:52.240]  It's a shotgun.
[31:52.720 --> 31:54.420]  It's like a shotgun on either side.
[31:56.180 --> 31:56.980]  Oh, God.
[31:57.460 --> 31:57.760]  Three.
[31:58.680 --> 31:59.300]  Oh, God.
[31:59.320 --> 32:00.200]  Oh, you're not going to make it.
[32:00.380 --> 32:01.500]  Three, two, one.
[32:02.640 --> 32:03.000]  Oh!
[32:04.560 --> 32:06.120]  Dude, it's so scary.
[32:06.440 --> 32:07.400]  It's so scary.
[32:07.660 --> 32:08.060]  Yeah, I know.
[32:10.700 --> 32:12.400]  Well, Gavin, you've killed us all.
[32:12.700 --> 32:15.520]  Why did I die and you didn't?
[32:15.600 --> 32:16.060]  We went together.
[32:16.380 --> 32:16.640]  I don't know.
[32:17.140 --> 32:17.640]  No, we weren't.
[32:17.760 --> 32:18.340]  You were further back.
[32:19.200 --> 32:20.020]  I didn't hit it that hard.
[32:20.160 --> 32:22.000]  Let's try to blend in with the other Tesla coils.
[32:23.980 --> 32:25.140]  I'm one of you.
[32:25.400 --> 32:25.940]  The fan.
[32:26.100 --> 32:27.320]  Oh, the fans are so scary.
[32:27.580 --> 32:29.540]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[32:29.540 --> 32:29.640]  Oh, my God.
[32:29.640 --> 32:29.860]  Oh, my God.
[32:29.920 --> 32:30.560]  He's not going to make it.
[32:30.820 --> 32:30.980]  One.
[32:30.980 --> 32:31.720]  Plenty of time.
[32:31.760 --> 32:32.780]  Plenty of time.
[32:32.880 --> 32:33.540]  I didn't make it.
[32:33.840 --> 32:35.240]  We were all that ready to go.
[32:35.360 --> 32:37.520]  We can't get through the first section.
[32:38.780 --> 32:39.580]  Chaos mode.
[32:39.740 --> 32:40.160]  Again.
[32:41.400 --> 32:41.960]  I'm off.
[32:42.940 --> 32:44.160]  You fuck, Gavin.
[32:45.100 --> 32:46.380]  All right, Andrew, it's on you.
[32:46.700 --> 32:48.060]  You killed me, Gavin.
[32:48.500 --> 32:49.100]  I had it all under control.
[32:49.100 --> 32:49.760]  Start dropping these.
[32:50.160 --> 32:50.940]  Start dropping these.
[32:51.160 --> 32:52.460]  Just make it insane.
[32:52.640 --> 32:53.040]  Drop them.
[32:54.400 --> 32:54.900]  Drop them.
[32:55.020 --> 32:55.460]  Drop more.
[32:57.680 --> 32:58.520]  Eight seconds.
[32:59.080 --> 32:59.780]  Oh, he's going to make it.
[32:59.820 --> 33:00.360]  He's going to make it.
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.410]  Five, four, three.
[33:02.940 --> 33:03.340]  No.
[33:03.780 --> 33:04.560]  No.
[33:11.140 --> 33:12.380]  Let's go.
[33:13.260 --> 33:13.760]  It did.
[33:14.810 --> 33:16.580]  You dickhead, Gavin.
[33:18.680 --> 33:19.680]  I'm off.
[33:20.040 --> 33:20.720]  Oh, come on.
[33:21.600 --> 33:22.600]  How did you survive?
[33:24.770 --> 33:25.500]  Oh, no.
[33:26.220 --> 33:27.000]  Gun.
[33:27.800 --> 33:28.700]  Just a gun.
[33:29.160 --> 33:29.740]  Oh, no.
[33:31.360 --> 33:32.160]  Gavin?
[33:32.560 --> 33:32.640]  Yeah.
[33:32.780 --> 33:33.180]  Gavin!
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.140]  Oh, toss.
[33:40.320 --> 33:42.320]  That's so scary.
[33:48.960 --> 33:50.500]  Ow, ow, ow, guys.
[33:50.880 --> 33:51.280]  Goddamn.
[33:52.800 --> 33:53.300]  No.
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.860]  You fucking dick, Eric.
[33:55.220 --> 33:56.020]  Oh, no.
[33:59.620 --> 34:03.080]  Guys, this is not chaos mode.
[34:04.840 --> 34:06.740]  You can make anything chaos mode.
[34:07.140 --> 34:08.920]  I've been doing it for 13 years.
[34:09.420 --> 34:10.600]  Oh, the bombs.
[34:11.020 --> 34:11.620]  No.
[34:12.200 --> 34:12.760]  Holy shit.
[34:12.880 --> 34:13.360]  I'm alive.
[34:13.460 --> 34:14.060]  Holy shit.
[34:14.580 --> 34:15.500]  I almost made it.
[34:16.860 --> 34:19.880]  I got so fucked up about it.
[34:20.600 --> 34:20.920]  Oh.
[34:25.580 --> 34:26.220]  Oh.
[34:26.300 --> 34:26.860]  Oh, my God.
[34:27.860 --> 34:28.380]  Oh.
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.060]  Turn, turn, turn.
[34:31.120 --> 34:32.740]  You slept in me.
[34:33.340 --> 34:35.180]  Slept with a share of me.
[34:35.500 --> 34:35.920]  Rats.
[34:37.120 --> 34:37.780]  Oh, shit.
[34:37.880 --> 34:38.640]  Oh, shit.
[34:39.400 --> 34:40.740]  No one did enough of anything.
[34:41.420 --> 34:42.980]  That wasn't worth.
[34:43.100 --> 34:45.460]  That wasn't worth the 400 points.
[34:47.200 --> 34:48.940]  I'm never going to finish.
[34:50.760 --> 34:51.800]  Gavin, no.
[34:53.900 --> 34:55.000]  Gavin, no.
[34:55.040 --> 34:56.120]  Gavin, no.
[34:56.960 --> 34:57.900]  Where's the stop?
[34:58.380 --> 35:01.440]  Gavin, it's like telling my son to stop doing shit.
[35:01.480 --> 35:02.140]  Stop it.
[35:02.540 --> 35:04.220]  Guess what? I took your phone as well, bitch.
[35:10.920 --> 35:12.660]  Gavin, did you take my phone?
[35:17.760 --> 35:18.920]  I'm already done.
[35:20.640 --> 35:22.420]  This is impossible.
[35:23.600 --> 35:24.240]  No.
[35:25.920 --> 35:26.220]  No.
[35:28.620 --> 35:30.160]  Oh, you piece of shit.
[35:31.880 --> 35:33.160]  I'm doing it.
[35:33.220 --> 35:33.840]  I'm doing it.
[35:33.940 --> 35:35.040]  Get behind me, moose.
[35:36.420 --> 35:37.740]  He did it.
[35:38.220 --> 35:38.740]  Oh.
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.300]  I'm tired of being spun out like a dickhead.
[35:42.540 --> 35:42.640]  I'm tired of being spun out like a dickhead.
[35:45.980 --> 35:47.700]  Let's take it home, baby.
[35:49.100 --> 35:49.600]  Underdog.
[35:52.640 --> 35:54.560]  Alright, we all made it through that one.
[36:00.380 --> 36:00.880]  Wheels.
[36:01.280 --> 36:01.740]  Damn it.
[36:06.660 --> 36:08.520]  It was so careful.
[36:09.240 --> 36:11.220]  We're at the point where we're driving at two miles an hour.
[36:11.760 --> 36:13.520]  No, you piece of shit.
[36:14.240 --> 36:14.700]  Speed up.
[36:14.920 --> 36:15.920]  Bastard man.
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.800]  I didn't even come back.
[36:17.880 --> 36:18.540]  What happened there?
[36:19.540 --> 36:19.980]  Suck.
[36:20.560 --> 36:21.100]  Come on.
[36:21.320 --> 36:21.500]  Come on.
[36:23.560 --> 36:25.560]  Oh, he's slurring mines left and right.
[36:30.800 --> 36:31.840]  Give me the points.
[36:32.520 --> 36:36.200]  They didn't give like wrecking balls and destroying bombs for this game, right?
[36:36.540 --> 36:37.360]  Not so far.
[36:39.080 --> 36:41.100]  We're only halfway on this one.
[36:41.620 --> 36:41.980]  Damn right.
[36:42.440 --> 36:43.360]  What the hell was that?
[36:43.460 --> 36:44.260]  What did you just get?
[36:44.380 --> 36:45.840]  I have no idea. We're about to find out though.
[36:46.660 --> 36:48.200]  Oh, it's a fan bridge.
[36:48.200 --> 36:49.700]  We're so boned.
[36:51.260 --> 36:52.060]  Oh, Gavin.
[36:52.820 --> 36:54.160]  Yeah, what's up?
[36:55.060 --> 36:56.960]  Gavin, the front is...
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.420]  What is this? How do I even put this?
[36:59.080 --> 37:00.180]  You don't anymore.
[37:00.380 --> 37:02.740]  Everything has missed this one at the top there.
[37:03.320 --> 37:05.160]  There's no space anymore.
[37:05.480 --> 37:07.300]  Well, I need to put it on like a...
[37:07.300 --> 37:07.380]  Right there.
[37:08.020 --> 37:09.280]  Yep, that would be it.
[37:09.720 --> 37:10.680]  That would be it.
[37:13.080 --> 37:13.620]  You got multiple...
[37:13.620 --> 37:14.640]  No, don't tell him to hurry.
[37:14.900 --> 37:15.600]  He would have missed it.
[37:15.820 --> 37:15.940]  You suck ass.
[37:16.100 --> 37:17.520]  You did this to us, Andrew.
[37:17.520 --> 37:18.320]  Yeah, I did.
[37:23.070 --> 37:24.770]  Everyone just goes so slow.
[37:26.970 --> 37:27.490]  Mount.
[37:28.150 --> 37:28.390]  Hit him.
[37:28.690 --> 37:29.210]  Oh, you missed.
[37:29.810 --> 37:30.490]  You suck.
[37:32.050 --> 37:33.410]  They're gonna use this gun.
[37:38.460 --> 37:40.420]  I don't know if that actually does anything.
[37:40.740 --> 37:40.840]  Oh.
[37:41.700 --> 37:43.760]  I mean, I haven't seen it...
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.260]  Oh, no!
[37:46.180 --> 37:47.160]  What the fuck?
[37:47.160 --> 37:48.560]  No, you piece of...
[37:48.980 --> 37:50.080]  I got slapped silly.
[37:51.500 --> 37:53.360]  Crawling in Spider-Man style.
[37:55.480 --> 37:56.000]  Wait.
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.500]  Because he bit you in the jungle.
[38:00.080 --> 38:00.420]  Nick!
[38:00.540 --> 38:00.760]  Okay.
[38:01.740 --> 38:03.200]  I didn't do anything, Andrew.
[38:03.360 --> 38:03.920]  It was survival.
[38:04.040 --> 38:05.300]  You swerved into me.
[38:06.100 --> 38:08.040]  Gavin, or Andrew, whatever your name is.
[38:08.160 --> 38:08.500]  I'm sorry.
[38:10.520 --> 38:11.200]  Oh, that was nice.
[38:11.540 --> 38:12.360]  That was nice.
[38:13.380 --> 38:18.660]  Oh, shit.
[38:18.920 --> 38:19.880]  What a shot.
[38:20.780 --> 38:21.200]  No!
[38:21.280 --> 38:21.700]  Yes!
[38:21.840 --> 38:22.080]  No!
[38:22.220 --> 38:22.600]  Yes!
[38:26.080 --> 38:26.920]  I panicked.
[38:27.020 --> 38:27.420]  I panicked.
[38:27.640 --> 38:28.340]  Oh, my God.
[38:28.420 --> 38:29.060]  All the goo.
[38:29.620 --> 38:30.780]  So much goo.
[38:32.840 --> 38:34.020]  My finest run.
[38:34.380 --> 38:34.600]  Oh!
[38:36.880 --> 38:38.360]  What the God time did you do that?
[38:38.400 --> 38:38.920]  Did you have to wait?
[38:39.280 --> 38:40.420]  I don't know.
[38:43.910 --> 38:45.030]  I think we have to wait.
[38:45.490 --> 38:46.070]  We have to time it.
[38:46.230 --> 38:47.070]  We have to time it.
[38:48.570 --> 38:49.190]  All right.
[38:50.190 --> 38:51.090]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[38:51.090 --> 38:53.590]  What on earth just happened to me?
[38:54.050 --> 38:54.330]  Yeah!
[38:55.390 --> 38:55.890]  No!
[38:56.250 --> 38:57.610]  God damn it, I blew it.
[38:57.870 --> 38:59.190]  I lost the whole thing.
[39:02.430 --> 39:04.090]  Give me those finish points.
[39:05.030 --> 39:05.470]  No!
[39:07.150 --> 39:07.710]  No!
[39:08.630 --> 39:09.250]  Where's my comeback?
[39:12.850 --> 39:14.330]  Oh, a loop-dee.
[39:14.870 --> 39:16.450]  What is this one?
[39:18.830 --> 39:20.090]  Oh, it's another hole.
[39:20.090 --> 39:20.550]  Oh, fuck.
[39:21.590 --> 39:23.190]  Gavin, you suck.
[39:23.890 --> 39:24.310]  What's up, dude?
[39:25.650 --> 39:26.870]  There's nowhere to put it.
[39:27.490 --> 39:30.150]  That first run is so brutal.
[39:30.470 --> 39:31.810]  It's so insane.
[39:32.210 --> 39:33.010]  There's nowhere to put it.
[39:33.210 --> 39:34.730]  There's no more spots up there.
[39:35.190 --> 39:36.370]  You used them all.
[39:39.590 --> 39:41.090]  What is that?
[39:41.170 --> 39:41.970]  What are the sandbags?
[39:42.150 --> 39:44.270]  Those are the swinging sacks that I just unlocked.
[39:47.790 --> 39:48.310]  Bye.
[39:48.310 --> 39:49.830]  Oh, fuck me.
[39:51.810 --> 39:53.570]  Alright, 20 seconds, Nick.
[39:54.290 --> 39:55.730]  There's not a lot of time for this.
[39:55.830 --> 39:56.590]  Yeah, finally!
[40:00.090 --> 40:01.610]  No, that's bullshit!
[40:01.830 --> 40:02.390]  I'm not on it!
[40:02.530 --> 40:03.410]  I didn't touch it!
[40:03.710 --> 40:03.930]  No!
[40:04.790 --> 40:05.910]  Why am I sideways?
[40:06.570 --> 40:07.890]  I didn't touch it!
[40:07.990 --> 40:08.950]  I didn't touch it!
[40:09.070 --> 40:10.690]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[40:11.930 --> 40:12.410]  No!
[40:12.410 --> 40:12.550]  No!
[40:21.690 --> 40:25.690]  Remember when we were recording a heist and I talked about the noises Nick makes and he went,
[40:25.730 --> 40:26.310]  how do you do that?
[40:27.110 --> 40:27.890]  What are you talking about?
[40:28.230 --> 40:28.590]  No!
[40:29.410 --> 40:29.770]  No!
[40:31.710 --> 40:33.150]  That one really gets you.
[40:33.230 --> 40:34.850]  That fan is bad news, dude.
[40:35.230 --> 40:35.570]  Come on!
[40:35.570 --> 40:36.170]  Ah!
[40:41.450 --> 40:43.290]  Oh my god, the swinging sacks!
[40:47.300 --> 40:49.360]  Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive!
[40:50.720 --> 40:51.800]  You're a shit guy.
[40:51.820 --> 40:51.960]  No!
[40:53.060 --> 40:54.100]  Holy moly!
[40:54.680 --> 40:55.660]  Holy son!
[40:57.120 --> 40:58.660]  Put the bombs, drop the bombs!
[40:58.660 --> 40:59.160]  Oh, you're big.
[40:59.280 --> 40:59.600]  That's all.
[40:59.920 --> 41:00.200]  Oh!
[41:00.760 --> 41:01.180]  I'm big.
[41:01.200 --> 41:01.580]  Ow!
[41:02.300 --> 41:03.880]  Ow, stop touching me, big guy!
[41:04.940 --> 41:05.460]  No!
[41:07.620 --> 41:09.340]  Oh, what the fuck was that?
[41:09.640 --> 41:10.520]  I got obliterated.
[41:12.280 --> 41:12.760]  Ah!
[41:13.260 --> 41:14.340]  I killed you, Eric.
[41:14.380 --> 41:14.960]  I'm so sorry.
[41:15.080 --> 41:15.200]  Ah!
[41:16.320 --> 41:16.800]  Ah!
[41:19.360 --> 41:19.840]  Ah!
[41:19.940 --> 41:24.970]  Oh my god!
[41:25.590 --> 41:26.570]  Back to back!
[41:26.850 --> 41:27.910]  Back to back!
[41:28.090 --> 41:29.370]  That was clutch as schwoz.
[41:29.370 --> 41:31.370]  No, I just spawned, you fuck!
[41:32.890 --> 41:33.850]  Oh, shit!
[41:35.690 --> 41:36.070]  Oh!
[41:36.450 --> 41:38.110]  Second place, but at least I got it.
[41:38.210 --> 41:38.330]  Jesus Christ.
[41:38.330 --> 41:39.490]  Oh, that was not a good run for me.
[41:47.870 --> 41:48.670]  Dear god.
[41:48.710 --> 41:49.770]  Oh, that's so close.
[41:52.150 --> 41:54.310]  The game, the game is so slow now.
[41:55.430 --> 41:57.270]  Oh my god, Nick, get a better computer.
[41:57.870 --> 41:58.170]  No!
[41:59.750 --> 42:00.850]  What the fuck?
[42:01.350 --> 42:02.650]  I don't know, I don't know what's happening.
[42:05.850 --> 42:06.730]  It's fine here.
[42:06.930 --> 42:07.110]  Cool.
[42:07.310 --> 42:08.110]  Nick is in the matrix.
[42:10.230 --> 42:11.490]  Oh, these can go earlier?
[42:11.770 --> 42:12.250]  What is this?
[42:13.650 --> 42:14.250]  Oh my god.
[42:14.390 --> 42:14.830]  What is this?
[42:15.750 --> 42:19.270]  They're like bouncing, you bump into them, they're tires.
[42:19.830 --> 42:22.110]  Gavin, Gavin, earlier, earlier, right there.
[42:22.110 --> 42:22.970]  You son of a...
[42:22.970 --> 42:23.150]  Yeah.
[42:23.750 --> 42:24.830]  Oh my god.
[42:25.210 --> 42:25.630]  Yeah.
[42:26.490 --> 42:28.110]  This is the longest round.
[42:29.450 --> 42:29.930]  Ow.
[42:30.030 --> 42:30.730]  Where am I, where am I?
[42:30.870 --> 42:31.150]  Ah!
[42:32.110 --> 42:33.310]  Ah, I got killed by it!
[42:33.370 --> 42:34.570]  I just killed him instantly!
[42:35.250 --> 42:36.150]  Stop touching me!
[42:36.270 --> 42:37.350]  Stop touching me!
[42:38.150 --> 42:41.150]  Andrew has these recoveries that make no physical sense.
[42:41.310 --> 42:42.050]  It's just no sense.
[42:42.050 --> 42:42.530]  No, it's the vehicle.
[42:42.690 --> 42:43.790]  I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.
[42:43.790 --> 42:44.810]  I'm running out of time.
[42:45.170 --> 42:45.670]  There's no way.
[42:46.090 --> 42:47.430]  Not gonna make it, not gonna make it.
[42:47.430 --> 42:47.730]  He's made it.
[42:47.750 --> 42:48.710]  Suck it, suck it down.
[42:48.870 --> 42:49.170]  He's made it.
[42:49.170 --> 42:51.030]  Not gonna make it, not gonna make it, not gonna make it!
[42:52.130 --> 42:52.490]  No!
[42:54.830 --> 42:55.190]  No!
[42:57.850 --> 42:58.570]  Stay alive!
[42:59.170 --> 42:59.530]  Dammit.
[43:00.870 --> 43:01.410]  Please, sir.
[43:01.570 --> 43:01.810]  Please!
[43:02.010 --> 43:02.710]  Oh, goddammit.
[43:03.870 --> 43:05.190]  You gooing piece of...
[43:05.190 --> 43:05.630]  Oh, I really...
[43:05.630 --> 43:06.850]  I got hit by the sack!
[43:07.190 --> 43:07.670]  Shh, I'm alive.
[43:08.370 --> 43:09.230]  I'm somehow alive.
[43:09.510 --> 43:09.690]  Oh!
[43:09.750 --> 43:10.090]  Oh shit!
[43:11.130 --> 43:11.950]  No, don't touch me!
[43:12.390 --> 43:13.230]  No, don't touch me!
[43:14.210 --> 43:15.490]  That double killed me!
[43:15.890 --> 43:17.050]  Oh my god, how'd I stay?
[43:22.750 --> 43:23.470]  Oh, he's...
[43:24.030 --> 43:25.290]  He's not gonna make it.
[43:25.670 --> 43:26.690]  He's not gonna make it.
[43:26.950 --> 43:27.830]  He's not gonna make it.

[44:11.750 --> 44:12.930]  So did I.
[44:16.070 --> 44:17.030]  I thought I made it.

[44:46.250 --> 44:46.810]  The frame rates.
[44:46.910 --> 44:47.390]  The frame rates.
[44:48.030 --> 44:50.250]  It even, like, looks shit on our screens when you're moving.

[44:58.250 --> 44:58.690]  Gavin!

[45:03.910 --> 45:04.090]  Nope.
[45:05.090 --> 45:05.530]  Further...

[45:31.950 --> 45:32.770]  I can sneak it.
[45:33.950 --> 45:35.330]  You were saying for stopping.
[45:35.430 --> 45:36.310]  You got ten seconds.
[45:37.390 --> 45:38.450]  Oh, he's gonna make it.

[46:43.570 --> 46:44.810]  Oh, that should be enough.
[46:46.770 --> 46:47.290]  No!
[46:47.550 --> 46:47.950]  No!
[46:49.670 --> 46:51.350]  Nick, you better stay in this thing!

[47:40.770 --> 47:41.250]  You might be in.
[47:41.690 --> 47:42.250]  No, I don't know.

[47:48.230 --> 47:48.750]  Dammit.
[47:49.990 --> 47:53.450]  It's really just a question of did Eric also make the sudden death.

[47:56.990 --> 47:57.390]  Yes!
[47:58.310 --> 47:59.750]  Burn away sudden death!
[48:00.170 --> 48:01.910]  Uh-oh, whoever makes it past the starting section gets the win!
[48:01.910 --> 48:02.990]  Oh, my god, the beginning!
[48:03.510 --> 48:04.510]  Oh, no, the beginning!

[48:30.050 --> 48:30.370]  Yes!
[48:31.550 --> 48:31.890]  Yes!
[48:34.170 --> 48:35.990]  Oh, back to back!
[48:36.370 --> 48:38.050]  Didn't make the board again.
[48:38.690 --> 48:38.990]  Ah!
[48:39.250 --> 48:39.690]  Ah!

[48:45.290 --> 48:46.270]  Back to back!
[48:50.730 --> 48:53.590]  Like, we don't even have time for one more, but we're doing it.
[48:53.750 --> 48:54.090]  Yeah.
[48:54.150 --> 48:55.130]  Like, absolutely.
[48:55.410 --> 48:58.230]  I just unlocked launch pad as a track hazard.
[48:58.690 --> 48:59.090]  Ooh!
[48:59.330 --> 48:59.650]  Yeah.
[49:00.070 --> 49:01.870]  I wanna put those right in front of us.
[49:02.470 --> 49:04.370]  Oh, my god, and traffic crossing?
[49:04.630 --> 49:05.230]  Oh, no.

[49:19.470 --> 49:20.450]  Chaos mode, let's do it.
[49:20.830 --> 49:22.930]  All right, get your bets in, let's do it!
[49:24.870 --> 49:26.690]  No walls, weapons everywhere.
[49:27.310 --> 49:27.710]  Guys.
[49:28.770 --> 49:29.130]  Yeah.
[49:29.530 --> 49:30.430]  I got a new car.
[49:30.850 --> 49:31.430]  Type express.
[49:34.050 --> 49:34.730]  I'll roll for you.
[49:34.910 --> 49:35.210]  Roll with it.
[49:35.210 --> 49:36.130]  Roll tried and true.
[49:39.440 --> 49:40.500]  All right, here we go.
[49:42.080 --> 49:42.940]  What was that?
[49:43.360 --> 49:44.420]  I don't know.
[49:46.880 --> 49:47.400]  Oh.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.680]  You guys are a bunch of dicks.
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.000]  Just a bunch of dicks.
[49:56.460 --> 49:58.820]  We used it all up before you laid anything down.
[49:59.160 --> 50:00.660]  Just a collection of dicks.
[50:02.860 --> 50:03.760]  What is this, like a trampoline?
[50:03.980 --> 50:04.600]  It's not a trampoline.
[50:04.660 --> 50:05.380]  I like that, that's fine.
[50:06.080 --> 50:06.880]  Pretty fun.
[50:08.760 --> 50:10.480]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[50:11.280 --> 50:11.660]  Yes!
[50:12.840 --> 50:16.020]  If you put money on the rat, baby, you're sitting pretty.
[50:16.660 --> 50:17.620]  Yeah, for 10 seconds.
[50:17.780 --> 50:20.860]  350, that's it, guys, and that'll do it, 501.
[50:21.280 --> 50:22.380]  Every rat has its day.
[50:22.800 --> 50:23.020]  Damn.
[50:26.140 --> 50:26.660]  Yes.
[50:31.260 --> 50:31.780]  Gavin.
[50:32.240 --> 50:32.880]  Yeah, what's up?
[50:33.140 --> 50:34.300]  You're a psychopath.
[50:34.300 --> 50:34.560]  Yeah.
[50:40.220 --> 50:41.260]  Here we go.
[50:46.290 --> 50:46.810]  Okay.
[50:48.110 --> 50:48.610]  Okay.
[50:48.870 --> 50:49.310]  Oh, shit!
[50:51.930 --> 50:54.550]  Oh, God!
[50:54.910 --> 50:55.850]  Yeah, guys, go off the edge.
[50:56.130 --> 50:56.550]  Go off the edge.
[50:56.830 --> 50:56.970]  Why?
[50:59.430 --> 51:00.230]  Who died?
[51:00.630 --> 51:01.310]  I'm just gonna drink.
[51:05.410 --> 51:05.930]  No!
[51:06.490 --> 51:07.190]  I'm too small!
[51:07.190 --> 51:08.350]  Unbelievable.
[51:09.350 --> 51:09.950]  Oops.
[51:13.330 --> 51:13.930]  Why?
[51:14.150 --> 51:14.890]  I'm too fast!
[51:19.970 --> 51:21.170]  Oh, shit!
[51:21.450 --> 51:22.370]  God damn it.
[51:24.010 --> 51:25.630]  Oh, the fucking slide!
[51:25.630 --> 51:27.710]  He just saved me and then killed me.
[51:27.830 --> 51:29.170]  You got gooed.
[51:34.290 --> 51:35.690]  Oops, why'd I do boost?
[51:37.550 --> 51:38.750]  Why'd I do boost?
[51:39.330 --> 51:40.550]  Oh, my God!
[51:40.710 --> 51:42.470]  How is Andrew so wise?
[51:44.430 --> 51:45.930]  Stupid ice cream truck fox.
[51:46.270 --> 51:47.190]  Oh, finish!
[51:47.590 --> 51:48.370]  God damn it.
[51:51.650 --> 51:52.790]  Andrew's gonna take first.
[51:53.390 --> 51:53.770]  No.
[51:54.070 --> 51:54.250]  No.
[51:54.330 --> 51:55.230]  Oh, so close!
[51:55.310 --> 51:55.970]  I thought you were gonna get...
[51:55.970 --> 51:57.270]  Oh, damn, I thought you were gonna do it.
[51:57.730 --> 51:58.630]  Oh, oh, what's that?
[51:59.510 --> 52:00.210]  Let's do that one.
[52:03.010 --> 52:04.910]  What weapon did Andrew... did Gavin...
[52:05.970 --> 52:06.410]  What?
[52:06.970 --> 52:07.330]  What?
[52:07.990 --> 52:08.630]  I don't know.
[52:08.730 --> 52:09.150]  It doesn't matter.
[52:09.750 --> 52:10.530]  He got a fan.
[52:11.630 --> 52:12.310]  Oh, he did?
[52:12.590 --> 52:12.790]  Yeah.
[52:17.590 --> 52:19.150]  How do you flip the side of the fan?
[52:19.330 --> 52:19.430]  Oops.
[52:19.630 --> 52:21.910]  The, uh, bumper, er, trigger.
[52:22.750 --> 52:23.890]  Well, it doesn't matter now.
[52:31.250 --> 52:32.270]  Holy shit, dicks.
[52:32.310 --> 52:33.050]  Oh, this is hell on Earth.
[52:33.050 --> 52:33.610]  What happened?
[52:40.130 --> 52:40.850]  Holy moly!
[52:44.970 --> 52:46.610]  Oh, it's so slow!
[52:46.870 --> 52:47.570]  It's so slow!
[52:49.590 --> 52:50.110]  Oops.
[52:52.570 --> 52:54.370]  I don't know why it slowed down so much on my screen.
[52:54.490 --> 52:54.950]  Sorry, everybody.
[53:00.310 --> 53:02.270]  Andrew, what a prick.
[53:02.730 --> 53:04.050]  What a fucking prick.
[53:07.210 --> 53:07.730]  Gun!
[53:12.340 --> 53:12.860]  Hey.
[53:14.640 --> 53:15.160]  No!
[53:15.160 --> 53:15.660]  Yes!
[53:16.400 --> 53:17.460]  Second place is fine.
[53:17.500 --> 53:18.400]  I'll take that.
[53:21.030 --> 53:21.930]  Hey, points!
[53:22.790 --> 53:23.230]  Damn.
[53:24.670 --> 53:26.230]  Oh, this is game on.
[53:26.470 --> 53:27.490]  First, first, first, fourth.
[53:30.250 --> 53:31.010]  Yeah, you win.
[53:31.030 --> 53:32.190]  Mine has a built-in fan.
[53:33.950 --> 53:34.650]  So, no touchy.
[53:36.730 --> 53:37.630]  Oh, God, where is it?
[53:38.230 --> 53:39.470]  Wait, where's the stop?
[53:40.030 --> 53:40.310]  Over here?
[53:41.330 --> 53:42.550]  We're, like, all up under ourselves.
[53:45.350 --> 53:45.970]  There we go.
[53:46.310 --> 53:48.770]  I'm gonna turn the quality down just a hair to see if that helped.
[53:50.750 --> 53:54.070]  I think it might be time for that company to buy you a computer, Nick.
[53:54.630 --> 53:55.030]  Okay.
[53:55.750 --> 53:56.970]  This is not working.
[53:57.570 --> 53:58.390]  No, Andrew first.
[53:59.530 --> 54:02.970]  No, you're just gonna solve Andrew's tech issues, and then that'll be fine.
[54:03.330 --> 54:04.570]  Oh, my God, it's hell!
[54:04.910 --> 54:05.710]  Oh, it's so many goons!
[54:08.590 --> 54:09.130]  I'm alive!
[54:09.610 --> 54:10.210]  I'm alive!
[54:10.430 --> 54:11.050]  That's bullshit!
[54:11.050 --> 54:11.510]  Split it!
[54:12.650 --> 54:13.330]  No!
[54:13.330 --> 54:16.010]  I got achievement for being so loaded up with goons.
[54:18.170 --> 54:19.530]  I'm stuck!
[54:19.730 --> 54:20.530]  I'm stuck!
[54:23.010 --> 54:24.670]  Die! Die, prick!
[54:24.930 --> 54:25.670]  Yes, no!
[54:26.390 --> 54:27.130]  Damn it.
[54:30.510 --> 54:32.530]  No, the goon!
[54:32.830 --> 54:33.730]  Why did I explode?
[54:34.850 --> 54:35.510]  No!
[54:35.910 --> 54:36.350]  Yes!
[54:37.590 --> 54:37.830]  No!
[54:41.990 --> 54:44.190]  This computer has four hard drives on it.
[54:44.890 --> 54:45.290]  Okay.
[54:45.370 --> 54:46.670]  Does that have to do with streaming?
[54:47.050 --> 54:50.390]  It has nothing to do with why it would be running slow.
[54:50.830 --> 54:53.150]  It has 32 gigs of RAM.
[54:54.710 --> 54:56.150]  What year did you get it?
[54:58.170 --> 54:59.190]  It's got four hard drives in it.
[54:59.190 --> 55:00.890]  This computer has four hard drives in it.
[55:00.970 --> 55:02.770]  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
[55:05.150 --> 55:07.130]  Like, say, what color is the fan?
[55:08.430 --> 55:10.710]  Oh, you know what? It might be, like, five years old now.
[55:10.710 --> 55:11.530]  Oh, yeah?
[55:12.210 --> 55:12.450]  Maybe.
[55:12.850 --> 55:15.690]  You think for the amount of work we're doing and everything, it might be time to upgrade?
[55:16.850 --> 55:17.290]  Yeah, maybe.
[55:17.610 --> 55:17.890]  Maybe.
[55:21.270 --> 55:21.970]  Got him.
[55:25.830 --> 55:27.370]  Take it on the long run, baby!
[55:27.470 --> 55:27.490]  No!
[55:27.490 --> 55:27.670]  Woo!
[55:28.470 --> 55:30.290]  I'm at first. Heavy in first.
[55:31.110 --> 55:31.670]  Look at that.
[55:34.590 --> 55:35.390]  Big style.
[55:36.310 --> 55:37.850]  Wait, how did Nick get first place?
[55:38.050 --> 55:38.850]  Yeah, that's right, son.
[55:38.850 --> 55:39.810]  That was bullshit.
[55:40.630 --> 55:42.190]  Sonny Jim, suck it!
[55:42.870 --> 55:45.010]  If you hit Alt F4, it'll speed up your computer.
[55:46.410 --> 55:48.370]  Nick, how long is the power cable to your computer?
[55:50.850 --> 55:51.570]  I don't know.
[55:52.050 --> 55:52.690]  It's right under there.
[55:53.610 --> 55:54.950]  There's a lot of cables down there.
[55:57.010 --> 55:58.010]  You want me to go pull it?
[56:02.970 --> 56:05.190]  I mean, yeah, if the company's buying, sure.
[56:05.530 --> 56:06.070]  There you go. See?
[56:07.170 --> 56:08.190]  Who wants to put it together?
[56:08.870 --> 56:10.150]  I'll do it.
[56:10.170 --> 56:10.950]  Oh, okay.
[56:11.350 --> 56:14.710]  I put it together last time, and I don't want to do it again.
[56:15.810 --> 56:16.210]  No!
[56:16.450 --> 56:16.610]  Ow.
[56:17.330 --> 56:17.930]  I'm alive!
[56:18.330 --> 56:18.510]  I'm alive!
[56:18.870 --> 56:19.030]  No!
[56:24.570 --> 56:26.270]  I feel like you were rubbing that in on that.
[56:26.310 --> 56:27.130]  You suck.
[56:27.150 --> 56:28.230]  That was mean.
[56:28.950 --> 56:30.670]  That was like Spawn Cow's real good.
[56:31.770 --> 56:33.130]  I felt really good about it.
[56:33.350 --> 56:34.330]  Dum-dee-dum-dee-dum-dee.
[56:34.410 --> 56:35.250]  Oh my god.
[56:36.410 --> 56:37.410]  Oh my god.
[56:37.410 --> 56:37.950]  Oh my god.
[56:39.270 --> 56:40.730]  Just blew it.
[56:41.750 --> 56:42.990]  Hey man, I know what I did.
[56:44.230 --> 56:45.690]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[56:46.630 --> 56:48.410]  You sucky shitlord!
[56:50.750 --> 56:51.030]  Boom.
[56:51.430 --> 56:51.750]  No!
[56:55.810 --> 56:57.590]  While I was placing mines.
[57:00.330 --> 57:01.010]  Oh, so now it's hotter?
[57:02.950 --> 57:06.510]  It's just me and Gavin swatting each other in the air.
[57:09.050 --> 57:10.110]  Falling hammer fight.
[57:10.390 --> 57:13.230]  Two minutes from the best time of the week, guys.
[57:14.150 --> 57:15.630]  So crack a cold one...
[57:16.310 --> 57:17.350]  Oh my god!
[57:17.810 --> 57:20.090]  Wait, wait, wait.
[57:22.110 --> 57:22.590]  Unbelievable.
[57:23.270 --> 57:24.670]  How do you guys stay on like that?
[57:24.830 --> 57:25.250]  Nick.
[57:26.350 --> 57:28.850]  I mean, it really just had full power.
[57:29.110 --> 57:29.590]  I was just...
[57:30.930 --> 57:34.770]  I think Nick's able to do that because he has four hard drives in that computer.
[57:34.990 --> 57:35.550]  That's right.
[57:36.330 --> 57:37.510]  And they're all mine.
[57:38.130 --> 57:39.230]  There are many like that.
[57:39.230 --> 57:40.490]  Oh my god!
[57:41.470 --> 57:42.930]  Popping a shot off right at the end.
[57:43.630 --> 57:45.450]  What the fuck did I... what happened?
[57:46.190 --> 57:47.850]  Hey, who's the piece of shit?
[57:48.910 --> 57:49.390]  You.
[57:50.610 --> 57:51.090]  No!
[57:52.430 --> 57:53.650]  One minute away.
[57:53.970 --> 57:56.990]  One minute away from the best time of the week.
[57:57.330 --> 57:57.770]  You're gonna blow it.
[57:57.950 --> 57:58.310]  You're gonna blow it.
[57:58.470 --> 57:59.970]  Shut up!
[58:02.390 --> 58:02.870]  Sploosh.
[58:03.070 --> 58:03.670]  Flop a two.
[58:04.210 --> 58:04.670]  Oh no!
[58:06.870 --> 58:08.450]  Daddy's big now.
[58:10.130 --> 58:11.350]  Daddy's big night, fuck!
[58:12.750 --> 58:14.990]  Did you say daddy's big night?
[58:15.310 --> 58:16.670]  He did say daddy's big night.
[58:17.170 --> 58:18.910]  That was the fourth Batman movie.
[58:22.270 --> 58:23.490]  Just gone.
[58:23.870 --> 58:25.730]  Just a stroll through the park.
[58:26.350 --> 58:27.530]  You dunce.
[58:31.810 --> 58:33.930]  Nick doesn't want it bad enough.
[58:34.970 --> 58:36.670]  I'm thinking about my four hard drives.
[58:37.610 --> 58:38.690]  God damn it!
[58:38.850 --> 58:40.330]  I went upside down.
[58:40.770 --> 58:41.770]  Oh my god!
[58:41.970 --> 58:42.650]  I'm an idiot!
[58:42.830 --> 58:45.070]  Ladies and gentlemen, 5-0-1.
[58:45.270 --> 58:45.830]  We've done it.
[58:45.950 --> 58:46.630]  It's final one.
[58:46.910 --> 58:47.550]  Quentin time.
[58:48.270 --> 58:50.110]  It's the best time of the week.
[58:50.230 --> 58:51.550]  It's 5-0-1.
[58:51.690 --> 58:55.790]  But we're gonna take it all the way until we have a winner here in Makeway.
[58:56.470 --> 58:56.490]  Ah!
[58:56.830 --> 58:58.090]  Ah, you worthless shit!
[58:58.210 --> 58:58.310]  No!
[58:58.810 --> 59:02.050]  Wait, so it drove you ahead like an idiot and we all died for it?
[59:02.310 --> 59:02.610]  Uh-huh.
[59:02.610 --> 59:04.870]  And then you died like a twat.
[59:04.910 --> 59:05.430]  Who, me?
[59:06.210 --> 59:07.390]  No, whoever died at the end.
[59:07.490 --> 59:08.150]  Was that you?
[59:09.150 --> 59:09.430]  No.
[59:10.990 --> 59:13.750]  Nick's agreeing, but doesn't know what he's agreeing.
[59:13.990 --> 59:14.650]  No, I am agreeing.
[59:14.650 --> 59:17.730]  He just heard someone getting mad and he went, hell yeah, me too.
[59:18.070 --> 59:19.130]  I'm mad as fuck.
[59:19.370 --> 59:21.190]  Nick's agreeing and then I didn't realize he was agreeing.
[59:21.250 --> 59:21.650]  Oh no!
[59:22.570 --> 59:23.710]  I was agreeing with you, fool!
[59:23.890 --> 59:24.530]  Oh my god.
[59:25.430 --> 59:26.650]  Guys, are we ever gonna make it?
[59:26.710 --> 59:27.850]  Chaos mode is real.
[59:28.490 --> 59:31.450]  Today has been a hell of a day.
[59:32.150 --> 59:32.850]  Slaps you!
[59:33.310 --> 59:33.810]  Slaps you!
[59:38.150 --> 59:39.630]  Was that your ladder?
[59:40.210 --> 59:41.010]  I'm gonna take a backseat.
[59:46.210 --> 59:46.730]  No!
[59:47.430 --> 59:47.810]  Gavin!
[59:49.690 --> 59:50.870]  Gavin's gonna catch up.
[59:51.790 --> 59:53.670]  With that, I've got one point.
[59:55.270 --> 59:56.610]  No, you didn't look at your hook!
[59:56.810 --> 59:57.510]  Okay, okay.
[59:58.010 --> 59:58.970]  And you got first.
[59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.350]  You overtook Andrew, who couldn't even back-to-back.
[01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.710]  Yeah.
[01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:06.310]  No, don't take all the-
[01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:09.190]  Oh, I should have a ball swing.
[01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.750]  Yeah.
[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.510]  Alright, so a new computer, yeah?
[01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.250]  Yes!
[01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.570]  If anyone doesn't need a ball swing, it's you.
[01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.870]  We're seeing Nick's frame rate when he's picking stuff up.
[01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:20.510]  Look, but it's plenty fine during the- uh-oh.
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:23.490]  Okay, it's alright, everybody calm down.
[01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.050]  Where do we even start?
[01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.670]  We start over here.
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:30.770]  If you're watching this stream, that's pretty powerful of you.
[01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.950]  How many frames you at, Nick?
[01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:36.450]  I don't know, man.
[01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.790]  Low.
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.190]  We might need to use my backup angle for the VOD.
[01:00:41.890 --> 01:00:42.910]  Oh yeah, we could do that.
[01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.030]  That's a good idea, let's do that.
[01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.750]  I thought there wasn't gonna be any editing that we were gonna have to worry about.
[01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:48.850]  That isn't editing.
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:50.610]  I mean-
[01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:52.010]  He has to put a video on it anyway.
[01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:55.190]  Right, which is-
[01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:59.870]  You've thrown me so hard, I can't concentrate.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.650]  Do you think clicking on the other video is now editing?
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:06.410]  So if you put video and audio together, it's not editing.
[01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.850]  It's not editing if there's video and audio together.
[01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:15.830]  When you go to Premiere and you start a new project, you call it not an edit?
[01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.890]  What if I'm just exploiting a video I threw in there? Is that an edit?
[01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:24.690]  He's syncing audio and-
[01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.530]  Yes, that's an edit, yes!
[01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.170]  Wow, I've done a lot more editing in my life than I realized.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.670]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:31.250]  I am alive!
[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.930]  Yeah, you've probably done a lot, like a lot more editing.
[01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:34.790]  A hundred percent.
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.310]  My point is, he has to go to the folder.
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:38.890]  He has to edit it.
[01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.310]  He has to edit it, it's an edit.
[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:46.330]  Right, but it's not any more if he uses my video instead of his, he just clicks a different link.
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.070]  Oh, guys, that fucked me!
[01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:49.290]  It started early!
[01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:55.730]  I was gonna just park and wait for the kids to stop fighting and it just started!
[01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:58.250]  I can't argue and drive at the same time.
[01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.510]  I'm gonna have to turn this car around.
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:07.490]  I'm not saying he's not editing.
[01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.810]  You just said I'm not editing!
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:16.310]  Just talking out both sides of his mouth, it's so great.
[01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:20.070]  What I'm saying is though, whether you use mine or yours, it's the same amount of effort.
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.430]  I'm not disagreeing with that.
[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:26.810]  I'm saying that it's an edit.
[01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:29.610]  Yeah, but that's not what we're talking about.
[01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.770]  Why are we talking about that? That doesn't affect whether we use mine or your angle.
[01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.070]  First place, baby!
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:46.650]  Hey, here's the thing. No matter what, I'm tweaking the audio, right?
[01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:47.570]  So that's an edit.
[01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:48.170]  Right, in the edit.
[01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.810]  Right, in the edit.
[01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.150]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.890]  Which I'm editing in a separate program to then put into the other program.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.650]  Right, because you're having to do an edit.
[01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.510]  Right.
[01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:57.130]  Right.
[01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.990]  Whose audio are you gonna be tweaking, do you think?
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:02.310]  Everybody's. I gotta equalize them.
[01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:02.790]  Okay.
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.530]  He's so good, it's just like, I'm about to make this point.
[01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.930]  Oh, shit, my point.
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:16.890]  I'm in such chaos mode, I tried to bring my track piece to the start.
[01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:22.070]  I don't remember...
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.170]  Oh, my God!
[01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:27.930]  I can't drive even when I'm not editing.
[01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:29.350]  Editing? What?
[01:03:29.590 --> 01:03:30.770]  Editing even when you're not editing.
[01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.990]  No!
[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:34.590]  Are you rainbowed over the track?
[01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.530]  Do you think this is an edit? This is a video game.
[01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.770]  I gotta tweak my tires a little bit.
[01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:40.570]  Right, but later on it's gonna be an edit.
[01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:42.630]  Ow.
[01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.010]  I felt that.
[01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.390]  Oh, you son of a bitch!
[01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:47.970]  You piece of chew, I deserved it.
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.150]  Oh, nice recovery.
[01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:51.110]  Thank you!
[01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.710]  Ow.
[01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:55.210]  I went out of frame upwards.
[01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.030]  I vertically went out of frame and died.
[01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:58.990]  You look like Smash Bros.
[01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.070]  Oh, shit! Yeah, I got Smash Bros.
[01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:08.290]  I wish everything we recorded today could come out today.
[01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:09.430]  I'm not kidding.
[01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:10.450]  That was some good shit.
[01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:13.670]  We recorded so much today.
[01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.410]  There's a camera going over there! There's no one else!
[01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:17.770]  There's a camera on me!
[01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.410]  Hey, that's me filming, man.
[01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.210]  Oh, God.
[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.550]  This is awful!
[01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:31.250]  But before these heists even come out, we have like five other heist videos.
[01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:32.730]  There's so many heist videos.
[01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:35.170]  We've got all of our ghost hunting videos that have come out.
[01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.230]  And a between the heist, and a mini heist.
[01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.470]  Yeah, and then the wrong heist.
[01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.330]  And the wrong mini heist.
[01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:43.310]  Oh, fuck.
[01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.170]  So, let me get this straight.
[01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:50.110]  This is for the DJ mission, or what is this?
[01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.010]  No!
[01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:58.450]  I feel like I've played this before.
[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.770]  Someone suggested if I mute this video, am I editing?
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:06.910]  Bendia.
[01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.770]  That's not the same as editing.
[01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:13.170]  When does plopping files become an edit?
[01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.890]  It's an edit! You have to export! You have to line everything up!
[01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:17.490]  You have to make everything! It's an edit!
[01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:19.090]  Guys, we're not getting any points!
[01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:22.190]  So, if I have to export, it was an edit.
[01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:24.470]  I'm getting light-headed.
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:27.050]  So, if I trim a video on my phone, and then...
[01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.470]  That's an edit!
[01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:30.010]  You're making an edit to it.
[01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.570]  How is that not an edit?
[01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.790]  I don't disagree that it's an edit. I'm just asking you if it's an edit.
[01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:37.450]  It is an edit! Why wouldn't it be an edit?
[01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:39.910]  I'm pretty sure you have to press the edit button to do that.
[01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.590]  Everything you've been saying has me disagreeing that it's an edit.
[01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:46.410]  Wait, I'm alive? No!
[01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.270]  I feel this font...
[01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:53.230]  This episode can't come out. We can't release this.
[01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:54.090]  It's live!
[01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:59.410]  I hope you enjoyed it live, because you'll never see this shit again.
[01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:00.630]  This will never come out.
[01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:01.770]  Oh my god.
[01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:03.230]  You got sacked, son.
[01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:06.330]  I was doing pretty good until I got sacked in the mouth.
[01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.050]  We can't finish any of this.
[01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:14.530]  I don't know where I am! I disappeared into the heavens!
[01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:16.330]  I'm still in! I'm still in! I'm out!
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.790]  How are you still alive?
[01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:23.370]  I gotta get away from here!
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:24.650]  I gotta get out of the death zone!
[01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:26.650]  Where's the end?
[01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:28.050]  Where's the end?
[01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.610]  You made it!
[01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:33.690]  You didn't! You freed us in that hell!
[01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:35.770]  The goo!
[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.210]  I got saved by...
[01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.930]  Derek!
[01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:45.050]  Why is it called getting sacked in England?
[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.670]  Are you put in a sack and taken outside?
[01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.470]  Why is it called getting sacked in football?
[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.870]  Are you put in a sack and put in a bowl?
[01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.870]  Touché.
[01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:55.410]  That's all it took?
[01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:58.850]  You're getting knocked the fuck out!
[01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:59.610]  Jesus Christ!
[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:01.510]  Gavin, boost!
[01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.910]  No, no, no!
[01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.210]  No!
[01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:06.450]  Yes!
[01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.690]  Daddy's big now.
[01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:11.330]  Get your hammer horse shit out of here!
[01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:12.350]  No!
[01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:14.490]  No!
[01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.050]  Daddy's big night!
[01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.650]  This is my night, goddamnit!
[01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:22.150]  No!
[01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:22.810]  No!
[01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:30.090]  This is the most insane game of this we've ever played.
[01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:31.470]  Oh, I didn't realize I was coming back.
[01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:32.110]  Oh my god.
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.610]  Oh, twat in my bollocks.
[01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:36.410]  You got it!
[01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:42.050]  Alright, everyone make sure to record this live stream because it can't come out.
[01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.570]  We can never release it!
[01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:47.670]  It's too bad!
[01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.810]  It's too bad!
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:53.070]  It's just screaming and not playing properly.
[01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:56.230]  This is too bad!
[01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:57.250]  It's bad!
[01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.070]  I'm having fun.
[01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.090]  What did I get?
[01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:03.210]  Nutball?
[01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:07.530]  I don't remember where the start is anymore.
[01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:12.370]  We played nutball with a Nerf Vortex football.
[01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:14.450]  Nutball's no joke.
[01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:16.430]  No joke. Hurts.
[01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.170]  There's nowhere for you guys to put it at the beginning.
[01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:20.830]  Wait, is this what?
[01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:23.350]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.810]  On the upside, I won't have to edit it if we don't put it out.
[01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:33.610]  According to Gavin, it's not an edit anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.990]  If you close the file, is that an edit?
[01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:40.430]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:44.950]  I don't even think you know what you're arguing for anymore.
[01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:48.350]  Gavin, here's the thing. I have to download a video file,
[01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:49.990]  and then sync audio files.
[01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.690]  It's an edit.
[01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:53.230]  Oh my god!
[01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:57.670]  How does Meg live with you?
[01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.330]  How?
[01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:59.050]  How?
[01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:03.310]  You are arguing both things.
[01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:04.910]  Well, because...
[01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:06.570]  Whether it's mine or his.
[01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.590]  What he said applies.
[01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:10.930]  This is...
[01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.090]  I am in...
[01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:15.130]  You're being very rabbit-like right now.
[01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:17.270]  You're being the evil Ukrainian Jackrabbit.
[01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:18.570]  Oh yeah, he's full rabbit mode.
[01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:21.510]  You worthless prick.
[01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:24.750]  You son of a...
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:27.310]  Please sir, please sir, I'm alive.
[01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:28.830]  Oh shit, I lived!
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:33.690]  How on earth...
[01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:33.990]  No!
[01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:36.970]  No!
[01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:37.710]  No!
[01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:38.850]  Oh, you got saved by the goo.
[01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:41.050]  The goo saved you, you worthless ass!
[01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.790]  Die!
[01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:47.750]  I needed to survive!
[01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:50.890]  No, I thought it was Gavin and I killed Bird!
[01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.990]  I need the points.
[01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:57.010]  Apply the edit before you export.
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.650]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:00.830]  No shit!
[01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.890]  It's not an edit, it's just an export!
[01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:04.990]  Oh my god!
[01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:07.210]  Wait, did you say it's not an edit, it's just an export?
[01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:08.990]  Who gives a fuck?
[01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:11.130]  If you have to save a bunch of shit, it's an edit!
[01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:12.310]  Nobody cares!
[01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:14.010]  I'm gonna die!
[01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:19.750]  That was just a bunch of cards honking and going off the edge.
[01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.990]  No stop, you're killing me!
[01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:24.950]  No, the boss!
[01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:33.470]  Smack, smack, smack!
[01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:35.810]  Shit!
[01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:37.070]  Couldn't that just be a sink?
[01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:39.990]  But it still has an export attached to it too!
[01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.830]  But I'm editing the audio!
[01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:44.090]  Yes, exactly, it's an edit!
[01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.410]  No!
[01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.490]  No!
[01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:50.130]  Nick, I think we've all established it's an edit, alright?
[01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:53.410]  The commenters are arguing.
[01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:54.510]  You suck!
[01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:55.710]  What's that mean, the commenters?
[01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:58.430]  What did I say?
[01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:59.470]  I think you said commoners.
[01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:01.410]  Commenters! You killed me!
[01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.550]  I didn't call them commenters!
[01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.590]  Wait, what?
[01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:05.570]  What?
[01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:10.110]  I'm so close!
[01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:16.490]  Oh my god, I didn't get any of the first seven checkpoints.
[01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.430]  How are we still playing?!
[01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:22.270]  No, it's over.
[01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:23.190]  Nick's doing it!
[01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:23.970]  Nope.
[01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:24.530]  Nope.
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:28.310]  I'm gonna make sure I get to this sudden death.
[01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.070]  I'm gonna make it.
[01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:33.310]  Let me wait for my weapon, he says.
[01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:36.290]  Where's the front?
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.260]  I'm getting lightheaded, I feel crazy.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.640]  How did I miss this spot?
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.380]  Look at you, editing the track.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:02.200]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.900]  Holy shit.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.240]  No, Andrew!
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.920]  Why'd I become big?
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.220]  I've already fallen.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.600]  I'm shagging a pipe!
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.620]  Yeah, not the first time.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.580]  I need so many points to make the sudden death.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.580]  Oh, you jumped over the goo!
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.840]  I can't believe it!
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.220]  He ain't making it, no way.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.920]  Die, die, die, die, die, die!
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.800]  He did it!
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.240]  Oh.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.400]  I think the earlier section should be worth more points, to be honest.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.080]  I killed myself!
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:46.620]  Shit!
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.280]  How? One wheel?
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:49.960]  One?
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.840]  It's a three-wheeled vehicle, of course!
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:54.540]  No!
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:56.500]  I'm so small!
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.500]  Nick, edit out all the parts where I lose.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.840]  Can you edit out all the parts
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.280]  about editing?
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.100]  No, that stays there.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.280]  The comments are going to be
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.200]  ruthless, too.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.380]  Yeah, because they're going to be like,
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.960]  I know what editing is!
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:22.440]  Are you being Gavin, or are you me?
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.540]  Who are you mad at?
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.220]  The commenters, apparently.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.520]  The commenters!
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.220]  The commenters!
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.740]  Well, I assume they're coming from a place of...
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.500]  Ah, fuck it, I don't care.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.300]  Is that not posh enough for you?
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:36.640]  It might be posh.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.420]  The commoners!
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.640]  He keeps calling them commoners!
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.300]  No!
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.100]  You told him that!
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.260]  I got him!
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:49.560]  No!
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.620]  Oh my god!
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:55.800]  Ah!
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.900]  I got nutsacked!
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:58.900]  Oh my god!
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.900]  Oh my god!
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.220]  The commoners won't like that one.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.660]  The commoners sound like me.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.660]  I guess I'm a commoner.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:11.020]  But you agreed with me!
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  You agreed with me!
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.120]  No, to be fair,
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.880]  the editing argument
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.860]  was 10% us
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.900]  immediately agreeing, and then just fighting.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:21.920]  I just wanted to fight.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.980]  That's all it's been
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:25.960]  all this way.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.760]  The commenters!
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.040]  You're not plebs, you guys are cool, it's alright.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.260]  Geoff is gonna be
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.200]  so upset about what he missed
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:34.520]  today.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.920]  God damn it!
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:39.580]  Oh no!
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.280]  The freeway!
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.060]  Get him!
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.120]  Wow, that was really more effective
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.980]  than I thought it would be in the thing.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.420]  Crash!
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:54.120]  Crash!
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:55.320]  Die!
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.300]  That might be it!
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.320]  I don't think I did it.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.200]  You got four!
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.380]  Come on!
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:06.320]  No!
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:10.960]  No!
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:11.620]  Nick won!
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:15.580]  Back to back!
[01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's done it!
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:23.700]  Nick wins!
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.460]  Nick, how you feeling?
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.460]  Lord of the Manor!
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.760]  He's making all the commenters bow.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.760]  I got on the
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.280]  god damn board, though.
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:39.060]  Gavin, what do you think of Make Way?
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.180]  Great game, 10 out of 10.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.780]  Yeah, right? I knew it was gonna
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.420]  be fucking banger.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.160]  I'm unlocking some crazy stuff.
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.120]  Top map editing.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.240]  Yeah, really good edit
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:51.760]  on this one.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.580]  Wow, guys, I unlocked...
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.120]  We have to play this again because the track
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.500]  hazards I just got are insane.
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.740]  Oh my god. Well,
