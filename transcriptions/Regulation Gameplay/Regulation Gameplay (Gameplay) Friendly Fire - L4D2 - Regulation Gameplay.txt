[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  We are back with more Left 4 Dead 2 action. We're experts. We nailed the last one, so I'm boosting the difficulty to expert.
[00:08.160 --> 00:11.120]  Because we are pros.
[00:12.960 --> 00:14.460]  We'll be dead in a minute.
[00:15.640 --> 00:20.380]  No, it's not realistic. This is expert. Realistic is even harder.
[00:30.440 --> 00:32.760]  And that's all that matters for the team.
[00:32.960 --> 00:34.740]  Gotta look out for number one, baby.
[00:35.700 --> 00:39.340]  Number one is the team. And I was looking out for number one.
[00:40.340 --> 00:42.880]  Which was the team. There you go. There's no one in team.
[00:44.640 --> 00:50.460]  I had a friend whose last name was Parish and he graffitied his name on a fence but he misspelled it.
[00:51.160 --> 00:55.320]  He put a V after the R and I called him Parvish for five years.
[00:56.680 --> 00:58.000]  How do you miss... what?
[00:58.300 --> 01:02.200]  He didn't misspell it. He just sprayed wrong and it kind of looked like a V.
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.180]  And I just refused to let it go.
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.460]  Well, I was a good friend of you.
[01:08.040 --> 01:10.340]  Well, it was a written flub and you love flubs.
[01:11.480 --> 01:12.680]  I'm there to hop on a flub.
[01:13.320 --> 01:15.920]  Do you think that was where your love of flubs originated?
[01:19.760 --> 01:22.280]  Maybe. That's a great question.
[01:22.380 --> 01:22.800]  Do a test.
[01:24.540 --> 01:25.140]  Ow.
[01:25.620 --> 01:27.560]  Friendly fire does quite a bit of damage.
[01:32.660 --> 01:34.040]  So don't do that.
[01:35.080 --> 01:37.580]  Why am I at 67 health?
[01:38.160 --> 01:42.540]  I was curious how much friendly fire damage would deal.
[01:43.200 --> 01:43.980]  How much does it do?
[01:44.260 --> 01:44.740]  67.
[01:45.140 --> 01:45.160]  A lot.
[01:46.160 --> 01:46.760]  33.
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.780]  Alright, so we're down a health pack on expert.
[01:51.340 --> 01:53.980]  But we're up on research and knowledge.
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.800]  He did it for the team, Gavin.
[01:58.500 --> 02:00.980]  I'm going to be utilizing crouching for accuracy.
[02:02.480 --> 02:03.340]  That's the move.
[02:03.440 --> 02:03.840]  How do you crouch?
[02:05.120 --> 02:05.380]  Ow.
[02:06.860 --> 02:09.140]  You want to use another health pack?
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.440]  You ran in front of me. You ran through my character.
[02:13.900 --> 02:14.840]  Teach him a lesson, Gavin.
[02:15.160 --> 02:16.680]  You shot me shitless.
[02:17.160 --> 02:21.140]  You ran through me. The first one, that was on me.
[02:21.360 --> 02:22.560]  Second one, not my fault.
[02:25.220 --> 02:28.760]  The footage will show that there is a horde coming.
[02:29.060 --> 02:30.200]  Oh, shit.
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.380]  Oh, for God's sake.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.120]  I hear...
[02:36.120 --> 02:36.740]  Ow.
[02:38.480 --> 02:39.040]  Ow.
[02:41.930 --> 02:43.330]  Oh, I shot Gavin. That's me.
[02:43.430 --> 02:44.490]  I protected him.
[02:46.110 --> 02:47.930]  Oh, fucking charger.
[02:49.270 --> 02:51.430]  Oh my God, he found me.
[02:52.170 --> 02:54.190]  Dude, we're in rough shape.
[02:54.650 --> 02:55.830]  It's a right mess.
[02:56.490 --> 02:58.070]  So far, so bad, boys.
[02:59.730 --> 03:00.450]  We're experts.
[03:04.090 --> 03:06.330]  We're almost halfway through this level, at least.
[03:06.790 --> 03:07.670]  I might be trapped.
[03:09.090 --> 03:09.990]  Fresh crab!
[03:10.250 --> 03:12.270]  Oh, Nick might be... No, you're good.
[03:12.890 --> 03:13.590]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[03:14.290 --> 03:15.430]  Did you see that? That was nuts.
[03:18.470 --> 03:19.870]  Oh, got the hunter.
[03:24.610 --> 03:25.490]  Oh my God.
[03:27.170 --> 03:29.290]  Oh, what are you doing down there? Is that where we're supposed to go?
[03:29.710 --> 03:31.050]  Yeah, that's the way we go.
[03:31.370 --> 03:32.590]  He went without communicating.
[03:32.890 --> 03:34.310]  Yeah, at all, in any way whatsoever.
[03:34.750 --> 03:35.810]  Someone's gotta go all the way up to the front.
[03:35.810 --> 03:36.910]  I thought we'd go forward.
[03:37.830 --> 03:40.150]  Right, but we were pillaging for things.
[03:40.370 --> 03:40.750]  Behind me.
[03:40.810 --> 03:41.930]  I'm already pillaged.
[03:42.450 --> 03:42.790]  Thank you.
[03:42.870 --> 03:45.790]  Oh, this is where the Easter egg is, on the jukebox.
[03:46.390 --> 03:47.290]  The, uh...
[03:47.290 --> 03:49.170]  What was his name? It was a big deal.
[03:50.070 --> 03:50.710]  Jonathan Colton?
[03:50.710 --> 03:51.430]  Yeah, Jonathan Colton.
[03:51.430 --> 03:55.630]  We did a video that got probably a million views on the Easter egg.
[03:56.390 --> 03:56.830]  Oh, really?
[03:56.870 --> 03:57.690]  Back in the old days.
[03:57.790 --> 03:59.490]  I think I might be in that video.
[03:59.630 --> 03:59.930]  You might be.
[04:00.450 --> 04:02.270]  If it was Left 4 Dead, there's a damn good chance.
[04:04.590 --> 04:04.910]  Hey.
[04:05.370 --> 04:07.390]  Were you the ringer they brought in for this game?
[04:07.750 --> 04:08.350]  I was.
[04:08.890 --> 04:09.290]  Whoa!
[04:09.510 --> 04:09.830]  What happened?
[04:10.970 --> 04:11.950]  Oh, man.
[04:12.190 --> 04:12.890]  And, uh...
[04:12.890 --> 04:13.370]  There we go.
[04:15.550 --> 04:16.210]  Hunter down.
[04:18.150 --> 04:18.990]  Oh, Spitter.
[04:19.610 --> 04:20.210]  Or, uh...
[04:20.210 --> 04:20.670]  Smoker.
[04:20.870 --> 04:20.990]  Sorry.
[04:23.590 --> 04:24.930]  Just guessing at names of them.
[04:25.130 --> 04:25.550]  I just...
[04:25.550 --> 04:26.990]  It's been a long time since I've played it.
[04:27.010 --> 04:27.530]  Something's got me.
[04:28.710 --> 04:29.610]  Just start screaming,
[04:29.710 --> 04:30.450]  Tongue! Tongue! Tongue!
[04:30.450 --> 04:33.350]  It's easy to forget to confuse Spitter and Smoker.
[04:33.630 --> 04:34.070]  Gavin said.
[04:34.070 --> 04:35.490]  Oh, I just straight up...
[04:35.490 --> 04:36.470]  Did someone shoot me?
[04:36.570 --> 04:36.930]  No.
[04:37.170 --> 04:37.830]  I think so.
[04:38.150 --> 04:38.470]  No.
[04:41.770 --> 04:44.090]  I don't know if I like the team dynamic.
[04:45.710 --> 04:46.350]  What team?
[04:46.750 --> 04:47.330]  Good shot.
[04:47.410 --> 04:48.170]  What are you talking about?
[04:48.330 --> 04:50.470]  I think Andrew's probably already at the safe house.
[04:50.630 --> 04:51.890]  Yeah, I think he's probably at the safe house now.
[04:51.970 --> 04:52.830]  Pull him back. Pull him back.
[04:56.090 --> 04:57.490]  I guess look out for bugs.
[04:58.590 --> 04:59.530]  Yeah, I'll keep an eye on you.
[05:00.230 --> 05:01.030]  Eye out for you.
[05:02.510 --> 05:03.270]  How you doing, Nick?
[05:04.170 --> 05:05.750]  I love that Nick is Nick.
[05:06.310 --> 05:07.070]  I'm gonna heal real fast.
[05:07.130 --> 05:07.390]  Yeah.
[05:08.870 --> 05:11.250]  Oh, I may have alerted a bunch of creatures.
[05:11.290 --> 05:12.370]  I'm not gonna heal after all.
[05:12.430 --> 05:12.730]  I'm dead.
[05:13.970 --> 05:14.350]  Oh!
[05:16.950 --> 05:18.990]  One of them looked at me and I died.
[05:19.250 --> 05:20.410]  You might have shot me.
[05:20.850 --> 05:21.750]  I might have shot you.
[05:21.750 --> 05:22.650]  Zombie to the right. Zombie to the right.
[05:22.730 --> 05:23.310]  Zombie to the right.
[05:25.410 --> 05:26.070]  Still alive.
[05:28.010 --> 05:29.190]  Oh, yours was Silas.
[05:29.890 --> 05:30.270]  Yep.
[05:34.630 --> 05:35.650]  Oh, I believe that's Gavin.
[05:36.590 --> 05:36.850]  Oh.
[05:38.450 --> 05:39.670]  Getting you. Oh my god.
[05:39.970 --> 05:40.590]  Get him and go.
[05:40.910 --> 05:41.290]  Hello!
[05:41.290 --> 05:43.050]  Hello, welcome back.
[05:43.170 --> 05:45.050]  Just keep going. Just keep going. We're at the safe room.
[05:45.350 --> 05:46.950]  No rest for the weary, my man. Let's go.
[05:47.270 --> 05:48.230]  Oh, shit.
[05:48.270 --> 05:48.290]  Oh, no.
[05:50.030 --> 05:50.670]  Oh, shit.
[05:50.870 --> 05:51.090]  Oh, Hunter.
[05:53.450 --> 05:54.310]  For the team.
[05:54.810 --> 05:56.730]  Let's save house. Let's save house. Let's save house. Let's save house.
[05:57.090 --> 05:57.930]  Oh, no. Gavin.
[05:58.250 --> 05:58.750]  Damn you.
[06:00.990 --> 06:02.030]  There you go, Geoff.
[06:02.310 --> 06:02.850]  Thank you.
[06:03.190 --> 06:04.450]  Oh, look. Killed the most infected.
[06:04.450 --> 06:05.330]  Most kills.
[06:05.710 --> 06:06.210]  Yeah, well.
[06:06.650 --> 06:07.310]  Pretty even, though.
[06:08.130 --> 06:08.350]  Not bad.
[06:08.370 --> 06:09.090]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[06:10.490 --> 06:11.370]  Not bad, though.
[06:11.370 --> 06:17.910]  I got puked on and I was shooting at a Hunter and I just ran for the safe room once I shot the car alarm by accident while I was blind.
[06:18.890 --> 06:20.130]  I think I shot the car, too.
[06:20.630 --> 06:21.210]  Oh, you did?
[06:21.290 --> 06:21.430]  Yeah.
[06:23.070 --> 06:23.930]  Fuck that car.
[06:25.930 --> 06:26.990]  Well, it was in the way.
[06:27.290 --> 06:27.890]  How about you, Geoff?
[06:28.370 --> 06:29.290]  Uh, I was dead.
[06:30.150 --> 06:30.350]  Oh.
[06:30.430 --> 06:32.110]  I think I got killed by Nick.
[06:32.690 --> 06:33.170]  Uh-huh.
[06:33.290 --> 06:36.130]  From Nick bullets to my body.
[06:37.130 --> 06:40.050]  But I got saved by Geoff Health.
[06:40.650 --> 06:41.070]  That you left.
[06:41.230 --> 06:41.490]  There you go.
[06:41.610 --> 06:44.290]  Like we said, you created new life.
[06:45.150 --> 06:46.830]  Hey, remember sliding doors.
[06:47.790 --> 06:50.790]  The team is the most important and Andrew is the most important in the team.
[06:51.870 --> 06:53.310]  I wouldn't say that.
[06:53.510 --> 06:54.190]  Your actions do.
[06:55.090 --> 06:55.850]  Yeah, your actions do.
[06:57.010 --> 06:58.050]  I saved...
[07:00.910 --> 07:03.070]  You guys don't know how this game works.
[07:03.070 --> 07:03.910]  Oh, God.
[07:05.350 --> 07:06.790]  There's health and shit over here.
[07:06.810 --> 07:08.050]  Health kit's over here.
[07:08.290 --> 07:09.250]  Oh, yeah, I need one.
[07:09.330 --> 07:09.990]  Fucking take them.
[07:10.470 --> 07:10.850]  I don't care.
[07:11.090 --> 07:11.430]  I got one.
[07:11.490 --> 07:12.590]  Take it, but don't use it yet, Gavin.
[07:12.670 --> 07:13.670]  Let's see how far we can get without it.
[07:13.730 --> 07:14.190]  Yeah, big time.
[07:14.870 --> 07:15.550]  Oh, there are pills here.
[07:16.450 --> 07:17.130]  I've got Drenny.
[07:17.590 --> 07:18.850]  Yeah, you got pills, adrenaline.
[07:19.570 --> 07:20.890]  We still got one more health kit.
[07:21.970 --> 07:22.750]  Geoff, do you want to take it?
[07:23.210 --> 07:24.190]  I definitely do.
[07:24.350 --> 07:24.630]  Okay.
[07:24.770 --> 07:25.110]  All right.
[07:25.310 --> 07:26.130]  We're stocked.
[07:26.130 --> 07:27.530]  This is better than I could have expected.
[07:29.270 --> 07:32.410]  I was trying to bait them over, but I think I was silenced.
[07:33.070 --> 07:33.390]  So...
[07:33.390 --> 07:34.250]  Didn't work.
[07:35.990 --> 07:37.530]  You were going like, Harry!
[07:39.220 --> 07:40.430]  Get over here.
[07:40.510 --> 07:41.510]  Get over here.
[07:41.850 --> 07:42.550]  Studios.
[07:47.090 --> 07:47.790]  Lights!
[07:48.330 --> 07:48.830]  Camera!
[07:52.670 --> 07:53.370]  Plunge!
[07:53.490 --> 07:54.130]  Plunge!
[07:55.570 --> 07:56.890]  It's what they say.
[07:57.230 --> 07:58.250]  It's what they say.
[07:59.310 --> 08:00.290]  Gavin's porn studio.
[08:01.410 --> 08:01.890]  Nice shotgun.
[08:03.510 --> 08:04.950]  That's also what they say in the porn studio.
[08:09.880 --> 08:10.200]  Ow.
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.080]  Dude, that guy was climbing without an arm.
[08:15.980 --> 08:16.900]  A lot of talented...
[08:16.900 --> 08:17.540]  Hey, hello.
[08:18.040 --> 08:19.400]  If you need those bullets back, let me know.
[08:19.440 --> 08:19.940]  I can dig them out.
[08:21.100 --> 08:21.880]  I would... yeah.
[08:22.020 --> 08:23.340]  A lot of talented zombies out there.
[08:23.420 --> 08:23.920]  Oh, I'm on the ground.
[08:24.520 --> 08:24.600]  Oh, Geoff.
[08:25.460 --> 08:26.460]  Yeah, like those guys.
[08:26.920 --> 08:27.400]  I wonder...
[08:27.400 --> 08:28.140]  Oh, I turned around.
[08:28.200 --> 08:30.240]  There's three of my friends behind me with guns pointed at me.
[08:30.260 --> 08:30.780]  I think I know.
[08:32.300 --> 08:33.460]  No, you were around the corner.
[08:33.640 --> 08:34.680]  No, you were definitely outside.
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.680]  You know where the fudge is made?
[08:37.260 --> 08:37.940]  Molotov here.
[08:38.220 --> 08:38.640]  Boomer!
[08:39.600 --> 08:40.040]  Sorry.
[08:40.240 --> 08:41.340]  Oh, no, Nick.
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.860]  You didn't hit me.
[08:46.200 --> 08:46.640]  Geoff!
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.000]  What's up?
[08:48.500 --> 08:48.800]  Geoff!
[08:49.620 --> 08:50.040]  What's up?
[08:52.000 --> 08:52.560]  What's up?
[08:53.180 --> 08:54.280]  Well, not my health number.
[08:54.580 --> 08:55.780]  Why did you go into the fire?
[08:57.260 --> 08:59.380]  I don't think he ever got a chance to leave it.
[08:59.540 --> 09:03.660]  No, I threw that molotov when I was completely empty in that bathroom.
[09:04.680 --> 09:06.480]  I didn't move into anything.
[09:06.640 --> 09:07.560]  I just caught fire.
[09:07.720 --> 09:09.400]  Well, I don't know what you were doing down there.
[09:09.560 --> 09:11.100]  It went through the wall, Geoff.
[09:11.180 --> 09:12.040]  It went through the wall.
[09:12.060 --> 09:13.580]  Oh, it went through the wall, so it's not...
[09:13.580 --> 09:13.940]  Oh, yeah.
[09:14.340 --> 09:14.700]  Oh.
[09:15.500 --> 09:15.860]  Okay.
[09:16.340 --> 09:16.580]  Oh.
[09:17.080 --> 09:17.840]  I got it.
[09:18.720 --> 09:19.580]  Hey, whose body is...
[09:19.580 --> 09:20.100]  Oh, it's Gavin.
[09:20.280 --> 09:20.520]  Yep.
[09:20.900 --> 09:23.700]  I had a lot of stuff, so feel free to stock up.
[09:24.260 --> 09:26.080]  Yeah, feel free to loot the fudge out of this.
[09:26.500 --> 09:29.120]  Well, you said that, and somebody already took your health kit, so...
[09:29.120 --> 09:30.180]  Well, I wouldn't give it back to him.
[09:31.940 --> 09:32.160]  What?
[09:34.020 --> 09:35.020]  We're gonna get him back.
[09:35.680 --> 09:36.280]  We're getting him.
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.060]  You know what would be great right now?
[09:42.220 --> 09:43.180]  Some fucking fire.
[09:43.700 --> 09:44.500]  Anyone have fire?
[09:44.960 --> 09:45.400]  I did.
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.660]  Why did you steal that from your body?
[09:51.640 --> 09:52.220]  Why did I what now?
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.160]  Ah, get...
[09:55.960 --> 09:56.800]  Oh, there's Gavin.
[09:57.760 --> 09:58.360]  There you go.
[09:59.440 --> 10:00.520]  Geoff could use a hand.
[10:00.900 --> 10:01.240]  Nah.
[10:03.820 --> 10:04.300]  Oh!
[10:05.680 --> 10:06.920]  Oh, there's Gavin behind you.
[10:07.840 --> 10:10.000]  Yeah, these zombies are curbstomping.
[10:10.020 --> 10:10.460]  Is he on fire?
[10:11.100 --> 10:11.240]  Yeah.
[10:12.020 --> 10:13.080]  Ow, ow, ow, ow.
[10:15.500 --> 10:17.080]  What the hell is that noise?
[10:20.620 --> 10:21.860]  You piece of shit!
[10:29.680 --> 10:30.820]  Tank's coming around the corner.
[10:31.040 --> 10:31.500]  Behind you, Andrew.
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.980]  It's kind of funny from my perspective watching this battle.
[10:39.680 --> 10:40.680]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[10:42.460 --> 10:43.340]  It's going dark.
[10:44.040 --> 10:44.440]  Mama.
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.920]  Okay, I'm trying, Nick. I'm trying.
[10:48.740 --> 10:49.920]  I'll tell you when to dodge.
[10:50.060 --> 10:50.380]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.040]  I am gonna die.
[10:53.860 --> 10:54.660]  Great dodge!
[10:55.300 --> 10:55.960]  He died.
[10:56.160 --> 10:56.620]  Okay, he's dead.
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.140]  You did it, Andrew.
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.460]  There you go.
[11:00.860 --> 11:01.140]  Heal.
[11:01.640 --> 11:01.740]  Alright.
[11:02.200 --> 11:03.460]  Holy shit, that was epic.
[11:04.300 --> 11:04.820]  Nice job.
[11:05.120 --> 11:05.960]  Yeah, getting you, Gavin.
[11:06.940 --> 11:09.000]  That's why you bring him in for the ringer for your video, huh?
[11:09.000 --> 11:10.460]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[11:10.560 --> 11:11.660]  You know what? I take everything back.
[11:13.280 --> 11:13.640]  Oh.
[11:14.300 --> 11:15.160]  Good to be back.
[11:15.740 --> 11:16.560]  Hey, you missed a lot.
[11:17.820 --> 11:18.960]  Buddy goes pouch.
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.080]  Alright, she survived a headshot.
[11:25.360 --> 11:25.720]  Okay.
[11:26.300 --> 11:26.660]  Geoff!
[11:27.600 --> 11:29.440]  What are you saying my name for? I'm dead forever.
[11:29.480 --> 11:30.160]  Oh, he's back.
[11:30.400 --> 11:31.240]  You're about to be back.
[11:31.640 --> 11:34.280]  Oh, yeah, I was in the same, uh, nothing weird happened.
[11:34.280 --> 11:34.800]  Uh-oh, smoker!
[11:35.120 --> 11:36.660]  Yeah, I was about to go to the bathroom.
[11:38.360 --> 11:39.400]  You could say so.
[11:39.420 --> 11:39.980]  Oh, horde!
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.440]  Throwing a pipe bomb.
[11:41.540 --> 11:42.720]  I just don't want to deal with this anymore.
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.420]  I'm throwing a pipe bomb.
[11:44.540 --> 11:45.140]  Charge us somewhere.
[11:45.620 --> 11:46.020]  Oh, Nick killed everyone.
[11:46.040 --> 11:46.380]  He's dead.
[11:46.960 --> 11:49.560]  That's a waste of a pipe bomb because we're going to have a...
[11:49.560 --> 11:50.400]  Ah, that's stupid.
[11:51.460 --> 11:52.600]  Yeah, you know what though?
[11:52.660 --> 11:52.920]  Oh, well.
[11:53.560 --> 11:53.880]  Ah!
[11:54.180 --> 11:54.500]  No!
[11:56.160 --> 11:56.740]  Oh, shit.
[11:57.100 --> 11:58.260]  Nick's going out on his own.
[11:58.340 --> 11:59.300]  It's not working out for him.
[11:59.820 --> 12:00.120]  No!
[12:00.460 --> 12:01.160]  What are you aiming at?
[12:01.160 --> 12:01.520]  I injured it.
[12:02.920 --> 12:04.120]  Where are we supposed to be going?
[12:04.940 --> 12:05.620]  Over by me.
[12:06.980 --> 12:08.300]  I just don't have any ammo.
[12:09.420 --> 12:09.780]  Stop!
[12:10.340 --> 12:10.540]  Alright.
[12:10.680 --> 12:11.240]  Oh my god.
[12:11.620 --> 12:13.080]  Frying pan has no reach.
[12:13.880 --> 12:15.140]  Behind you, behind you, Nick, behind you.
[12:16.720 --> 12:17.240]  Thank you.
[12:17.300 --> 12:17.560]  Got it.
[12:18.240 --> 12:19.580]  Behind you, behind you, gonk.
[12:21.760 --> 12:22.620]  Health, health packs.
[12:22.620 --> 12:23.620]  Oh, health kits, health kits.
[12:24.040 --> 12:24.420]  Back here?
[12:25.280 --> 12:25.440]  Yeah.
[12:25.520 --> 12:26.980]  There are two of them over here.
[12:28.700 --> 12:29.580]  Let me take one.
[12:30.660 --> 12:30.700]  Alright.
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.420]  Let's get that.
[12:31.880 --> 12:33.100]  Looks like Nick needs it most.
[12:33.180 --> 12:33.560]  One more?
[12:33.980 --> 12:35.220]  No, hold on for now.
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.080]  Let's not waste it yet.
[12:38.340 --> 12:39.300]  Alright, we need to go back.
[12:39.860 --> 12:41.040]  I fucking hate this frying pan.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.680]  Alright, well, now I'm going to waste it.
[12:46.460 --> 12:47.260]  Oh god!
[12:47.620 --> 12:49.280]  Whole bunch of them if you want to funnel them.
[12:51.300 --> 12:52.580]  We're staying in the door.
[12:53.080 --> 12:56.840]  I'm down.
[12:57.540 --> 12:58.240]  They were behind us too.
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.320]  Geoff is taken down by a single bomb.
[13:01.240 --> 13:01.820]  Got him.
[13:10.340 --> 13:10.740]  It's...
[13:10.740 --> 13:11.560]  Boomer, to the left.
[13:13.080 --> 13:14.020]  Boomer on the left.
[13:17.510 --> 13:18.430]  All the way down.
[13:20.090 --> 13:22.310]  In the lane that I'm standing in, down the way.
[13:22.630 --> 13:22.850]  Spitter.
[13:23.270 --> 13:23.670]  Ah!
[13:25.310 --> 13:25.910]  Spitter's down.
[13:26.630 --> 13:26.990]  Nice.
[13:27.670 --> 13:28.010]  We're trapped.
[13:28.270 --> 13:28.910]  Nick and I are trapped.
[13:29.650 --> 13:30.350]  No, I got our backs.
[13:31.010 --> 13:32.150]  There's an AK over here.
[13:33.030 --> 13:34.410]  Oh, I need it so bad.
[13:34.490 --> 13:35.390]  I want it, I want it, I want it.
[13:41.200 --> 13:41.680]  Boomer.
[13:43.500 --> 13:43.980]  Nice.
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.820]  Uh, like a smoke or somewhere.
[13:46.120 --> 13:46.940]  You already get it?
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.300]  Uh, pipe bomb and boomer bile down here.
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.740]  This is a full balls section coming up, fellas.
[13:54.880 --> 13:55.180]  Over here.
[13:55.540 --> 13:56.200]  Full balls?
[13:56.880 --> 13:57.640]  Full balls.
[13:59.780 --> 14:01.320]  Clear hearts, full balls, can't lose.
[14:01.540 --> 14:03.380]  Clear hearts, full balls.
[14:04.540 --> 14:05.020]  Yeah.
[14:05.420 --> 14:06.160]  That's how that goes, right?
[14:06.380 --> 14:07.160]  I'm pretty sure.
[14:08.380 --> 14:08.700]  Okay.
[14:10.260 --> 14:12.020]  Come, uh, Gavin, come get these pills.
[14:12.020 --> 14:14.480]  Is that what happens to rats once they give them Doritos powder?
[14:15.200 --> 14:15.620]  Hey, where are you at, Gavin?
[14:16.200 --> 14:17.440]  That's how they drive those cars.
[14:17.460 --> 14:18.920]  You ever see the rats drive the cars?
[14:19.680 --> 14:20.680]  Here, let me heal you up.
[14:22.260 --> 14:22.880]  No, I couldn't.
[14:24.360 --> 14:24.820]  Thank you.
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.340]  Okay, I'm gonna pop my adrenaline during this just so I can try to reach the, uh, turn off.
[14:31.460 --> 14:31.640]  Yeah, I know.
[14:32.240 --> 14:33.560]  Alright, should we just try and keep up with you?
[14:33.940 --> 14:34.160]  Yeah.
[14:34.420 --> 14:34.600]  Yeah.
[14:35.700 --> 14:35.980]  Ready?
[14:35.980 --> 14:36.340]  Yeah.
[14:36.460 --> 14:37.200]  Don't shoot him.
[14:39.100 --> 14:40.400]  You can shoot him once, it's fine.
[14:40.780 --> 14:42.420]  Okay, I'm gonna go try to deactivate the alarm.
[14:44.840 --> 14:45.200]  Hunter.
[14:47.120 --> 14:49.100]  Oh my god, he did a, like, he did like a...
[14:50.220 --> 14:50.580]  What?
[14:51.120 --> 14:51.700]  Flat spin.
[14:55.060 --> 14:56.500]  Oh my god, he did a...
[14:56.500 --> 14:56.840]  What?
[14:59.960 --> 15:00.620]  Gavin, you okay?
[15:01.380 --> 15:01.700]  Yes.
[15:02.640 --> 15:04.000]  Got a little bit held up, but I'm good.
[15:11.370 --> 15:12.290]  Sorry about that, Geoff.
[15:12.510 --> 15:13.970]  You mean when you shot me?
[15:14.790 --> 15:16.530]  Uh, you ran through me, but yes.
[15:17.250 --> 15:18.090]  There's a spit somewhere.
[15:18.470 --> 15:19.210]  I got him, he's dead.
[15:19.310 --> 15:23.290]  It's funny, uh, I was just not shooting anybody and just running, but that's okay.
[15:23.530 --> 15:24.690]  Shoot me if you need to.
[15:26.230 --> 15:26.990]  Didn't need to.
[15:27.530 --> 15:27.850]  Ow.
[15:28.230 --> 15:29.390]  Didn't need to.
[15:31.250 --> 15:31.650]  Climb.
[15:32.790 --> 15:33.150]  Okay.
[15:33.270 --> 15:34.230]  Oh, we're going up? Shit.
[15:34.470 --> 15:35.150]  Ah, shit.
[15:35.270 --> 15:36.110]  I turned the alarm off.
[15:36.250 --> 15:37.050]  Nice, good job, Geoff.
[15:37.070 --> 15:38.090]  What happened to you, dude?
[15:38.890 --> 15:39.730]  I need to circle back.
[15:40.010 --> 15:40.970]  The ladder's on that side.
[15:41.390 --> 15:41.970]  Oh, yeah?
[15:41.990 --> 15:42.450]  Taking pills.
[15:43.230 --> 15:45.090]  You need to go to an optometrist.
[15:45.430 --> 15:47.170]  You need to get your eyes looked at.
[15:49.130 --> 15:50.370]  There were zombies!
[15:50.810 --> 15:51.970]  Geoff, you just killed me!
[15:53.850 --> 15:54.950]  What was that?
[15:55.950 --> 15:59.330]  I was trying to shoot the Charger as he ran by you, but I missed.
[16:00.190 --> 16:00.670]  I'm down.
[16:00.850 --> 16:01.430]  I'm gonna try and heal.
[16:02.950 --> 16:03.830]  Oh, shit!
[16:03.850 --> 16:04.370]  Charger, Charger, Charger!
[16:04.670 --> 16:05.570]  Ah, fuck, they're behind you.
[16:05.970 --> 16:06.330]  I'm down.
[16:07.410 --> 16:08.190]  Come on, man.
[16:10.610 --> 16:10.930]  Alright.
[16:11.070 --> 16:13.130]  Come on, come on.
[16:13.190 --> 16:13.830]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[16:13.910 --> 16:15.270]  I gotta take a second, I'm sorry.
[16:15.630 --> 16:16.570]  No worries, no worries.
[16:17.130 --> 16:18.470]  Get up, get up, get up!
[16:19.310 --> 16:20.730]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[16:20.830 --> 16:21.490]  It's gonna be close.
[16:21.690 --> 16:22.130]  It's gonna be close.
[16:25.930 --> 16:26.570]  Ah, fuck.
[16:26.730 --> 16:27.050]  Fuck!
[16:27.330 --> 16:27.710]  My arsehole.
[16:28.570 --> 16:29.210]  They're everywhere.
[16:29.770 --> 16:30.410]  Fucking cops.
[16:32.970 --> 16:33.630]  Shit, man.
[16:33.810 --> 16:35.530]  Fucking cops.
[16:36.670 --> 16:36.990]  Alright.
[16:37.390 --> 16:37.590]  Alright.
[16:39.390 --> 16:40.030]  Okay, round...
[16:40.030 --> 16:40.310]  First aid.
[16:40.390 --> 16:42.850]  I'm not taking that goddamn frying pan again.
[16:42.950 --> 16:44.170]  Oh, fuck, I have it already!
[16:44.450 --> 16:44.770]  Shit!
[16:48.330 --> 16:51.230]  If I grab a frying pan, can you grab my pistol?
[16:52.770 --> 16:53.190]  Uh, yeah.
[16:54.630 --> 16:54.950]  Nope.
[16:57.250 --> 16:59.330]  Well, now we've hindered two of us.
[16:59.490 --> 16:59.810]  No, here.
[16:59.990 --> 17:01.070]  No, I grabbed it.
[17:01.150 --> 17:01.570]  Do you want it back?
[17:01.610 --> 17:02.370]  Okay, no, take it, take it.
[17:02.410 --> 17:03.050]  No, no, you take it.
[17:03.110 --> 17:05.750]  As long as you get it, I'll take the hit.
[17:05.750 --> 17:06.670]  Did everybody get a health?
[17:07.710 --> 17:09.010]  No, there's two health kits left.
[17:09.370 --> 17:09.470]  Okay.
[17:09.590 --> 17:10.150]  There's one left.
[17:11.890 --> 17:13.550]  I guess I'll heal and take it.
[17:13.970 --> 17:14.590]  I'm the lowest.
[17:15.050 --> 17:17.850]  I'm gonna grab those.
[17:18.410 --> 17:20.010]  Did you really see the ladder as we ran by?
[17:22.510 --> 17:23.490]  Could you not?
[17:23.950 --> 17:25.250]  Everyone was climbing up.
[17:25.790 --> 17:26.750]  The ladder to the scaffold?
[17:27.370 --> 17:27.710]  Yes.
[17:28.650 --> 17:34.290]  Nick ran by it, around the corner, started looking around, and then saw where you're supposed to go.
[17:34.410 --> 17:36.230]  There's another way to climb up.
[17:36.230 --> 17:37.170]  Nick, I saw it immediately.
[17:37.770 --> 17:38.950]  Everyone was going up.
[17:40.130 --> 17:40.970]  They were?
[17:41.710 --> 17:42.270]  Yes.
[17:42.750 --> 17:44.250]  Everyone was going up.
[17:44.510 --> 17:44.970]  Okay.
[17:45.150 --> 17:46.610]  What in the name of...
[17:47.070 --> 17:49.630]  Holy shit, what is going on in this video?
[17:50.190 --> 17:52.230]  I didn't move an inch.
[17:52.250 --> 17:56.710]  I can't start a level without getting annihilated by someone on my team.
[17:57.910 --> 17:59.250]  I didn't move an inch.
[18:00.430 --> 18:02.630]  I was shooting, I didn't move an inch.
[18:03.570 --> 18:07.030]  You knocked 50 health off me and I got downed.
[18:07.550 --> 18:13.670]  I was firing an automatic weapon, I didn't move an inch, you were not in front of me, then you were.
[18:16.490 --> 18:17.790]  We need some accountability.
[18:18.050 --> 18:19.070]  There's a health pack up here.
[18:19.210 --> 18:20.850]  I'm gonna need to adrenaline so I can walk.
[18:21.670 --> 18:23.390]  Oh, I'm smoked, I'm smoked, I'm smoked.
[18:24.570 --> 18:24.970]  Oh, Jockey.
[18:26.790 --> 18:28.030]  Oh my god.
[18:28.970 --> 18:30.790]  I think we just die and reset.
[18:30.790 --> 18:33.370]  I'm Jockeyed, he's smoked, Geoff's picking up Gavin.
[18:33.630 --> 18:34.790]  Yeah, let's just reset.
[18:34.990 --> 18:36.670]  That was a fake run, that was a fake run.
[18:36.990 --> 18:37.790]  That was the real run.
[18:37.870 --> 18:40.750]  That was the worst run, guys.
[18:42.670 --> 18:44.450]  Those two killed Gavin.
[18:45.050 --> 18:46.630]  Those two, I didn't touch Gavin.
[18:46.670 --> 18:48.070]  You're right, Andrew killed Gavin.
[18:48.390 --> 18:49.510]  Gavin killed Gavin.
[18:49.570 --> 18:51.030]  I was trying to pick Gavin up.
[18:51.090 --> 18:51.830]  For Christ's sake.
[18:52.790 --> 18:53.190]  Oh, I know.
[18:53.390 --> 18:55.790]  Geoff, you were MVP.
[18:56.090 --> 18:57.310]  You were saving the day.
[18:57.790 --> 18:58.470]  I'm trying to.
[18:59.030 --> 19:01.370]  Here, Geoff, you take this last med pack.
[19:04.110 --> 19:05.630]  More pills over here on the ground.
[19:05.850 --> 19:07.750]  I'm gonna take the pills and then pick up the adrenaline.
[19:08.370 --> 19:10.670]  Gavin, I like your thinking.
[19:11.250 --> 19:15.530]  Nice. Alright, now don't stand in the doorway and see each other or the people in the front crouch.
[19:17.390 --> 19:18.350]  Crouching is a great call.
[19:19.630 --> 19:21.470]  I was crouched. I wasn't moving.
[19:25.090 --> 19:25.850]  Opening door.
[19:26.290 --> 19:27.510]  I'm getting sucked away from it.
[19:28.710 --> 19:30.530]  Refill my ammo and stay where you are.
[19:30.550 --> 19:31.490]  Follow out Gavin here.
[19:31.630 --> 19:32.510]  I'm standing next to Gavin.
[19:33.290 --> 19:35.190]  Standing next to me? You ran right in front of me.
[19:35.650 --> 19:40.930]  You know what? I'll take responsibility on that one.
[19:41.050 --> 19:41.510]  That's my bad.
[19:42.090 --> 19:43.670]  Alright, I'm down. I'm down on my knee.
[19:43.790 --> 19:45.810]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm down, I'm crouched.
[19:46.010 --> 19:47.390]  Oh my God, Geoff.
[19:47.990 --> 19:49.470]  I'm down on my knees, crouched.
[19:49.750 --> 19:51.630]  So nobody's shooting me in the back of the head.
[19:51.750 --> 19:52.710]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[19:53.610 --> 19:55.870]  Just like, full health, I'm down.
[19:57.210 --> 19:59.110]  That way everything's okay.
[19:59.750 --> 20:01.130]  Yeah, letting you guys know.
[20:01.290 --> 20:03.870]  Oh, a hunter is what I feel like with this gun.
[20:05.230 --> 20:06.530]  A jockey somewhere.
[20:07.470 --> 20:08.810]  I'm getting smoked. Ow.
[20:09.650 --> 20:10.750]  Jockey, jockey, jockey, jockey.
[20:11.110 --> 20:11.790]  He's dead.
[20:15.530 --> 20:18.490]  I corrected as soon as I realized the poor choice of words.
[20:18.810 --> 20:19.890]  You did, you did.
[20:20.450 --> 20:22.290]  Jockeys are the heart of the racing industry.
[20:24.130 --> 20:24.830]  It's true.
[20:27.210 --> 20:27.850]  That's me.
[20:28.570 --> 20:29.890]  You were trying to see me.
[20:30.150 --> 20:31.430]  Was that you shooting me, you mean?
[20:31.630 --> 20:33.450]  Yeah, Lizzie, you shooting me.
[20:34.170 --> 20:35.290]  Hey, Geoff, that was me shooting you.
[20:35.370 --> 20:36.950]  I felt it, I saw it.
[20:37.070 --> 20:39.490]  I looked up and I went, wow, there's the...
[20:39.490 --> 20:40.570]  You put the bullet in me.
[20:41.030 --> 20:41.590]  My friend, Nick.
[20:42.590 --> 20:43.350]  You should have told him right.
[20:44.470 --> 20:45.630]  I thought about it, you know what?
[20:45.810 --> 20:46.350]  Why not?
[20:46.950 --> 20:47.390]  Scared me.
[20:48.090 --> 20:48.510]  Why wouldn't you?
[20:48.530 --> 20:48.810]  Okay.
[20:49.650 --> 20:50.670]  After all, why shouldn't I?
[20:51.030 --> 20:51.350]  Yes.
[20:51.810 --> 20:55.070]  Like, you're moving on.
[20:55.070 --> 20:56.790]  Nick, you're really far by yourself.
[20:56.790 --> 20:57.510]  I know, it's okay.
[20:58.410 --> 20:58.630]  Okay.
[20:59.130 --> 20:59.370]  Alright.
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.430]  Nick's just like real Nick.
[21:01.550 --> 21:04.190]  For some reason, he had to deliberate about a lot of stuff.
[21:04.890 --> 21:06.610]  Yeah, I was thinking about some life choices.
[21:10.090 --> 21:10.490]  Spitter.
[21:10.650 --> 21:11.230]  Oh, shit.
[21:11.830 --> 21:12.350]  I got out.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.060]  What'd you get with the group?
[21:19.760 --> 21:20.340]  Oh, yeah.
[21:22.500 --> 21:23.840]  And we got some stragglers.
[21:25.480 --> 21:25.860]  Jockey.
[21:27.240 --> 21:27.640]  Alright.
[21:29.280 --> 21:29.640]  Nice.
[21:30.040 --> 21:30.400]  Ouch.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.780]  Hey, guys, we're doing great.
[21:32.980 --> 21:33.840]  This is where the tank showed up.
[21:34.320 --> 21:34.880]  Yep, it is.
[21:35.120 --> 21:36.020]  I have a Molotov.
[21:36.420 --> 21:37.800]  Oh, there's an AK over there.
[21:38.120 --> 21:39.340]  Nick, you are in the middle.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.720]  Decent pipe bomb.
[21:42.620 --> 21:43.000]  Thank you.
[21:44.560 --> 21:46.220]  We got another Molotov on the park bench.
[21:46.420 --> 21:46.620]  AK.
[21:47.580 --> 21:48.960]  Over here on the park bench, AK.
[21:50.580 --> 21:51.220]  Hell yeah.
[21:51.400 --> 21:52.340]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[21:52.680 --> 21:53.200]  Damn it.
[21:53.820 --> 21:54.380]  How you doing, Gavin?
[21:54.880 --> 21:55.300]  Went down.
[21:56.900 --> 21:57.340]  I gotcha.
[21:57.640 --> 21:58.520]  Are you crouching?
[22:01.020 --> 22:01.420]  Reloading.
[22:01.640 --> 22:02.280]  Okay, clear.
[22:03.280 --> 22:04.080]  Thank you.
[22:06.320 --> 22:07.480]  Okay, pushing forward.
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.380]  Tank.
[22:11.740 --> 22:12.020]  Tank.
[22:12.040 --> 22:12.560]  Oh, no.
[22:12.660 --> 22:13.260]  I got a Molotov.
[22:13.320 --> 22:14.340]  Who's got the Molotov?
[22:14.640 --> 22:15.120]  I got it.
[22:15.160 --> 22:15.460]  I do.
[22:15.580 --> 22:16.260]  Fall back, fall back.
[22:17.060 --> 22:17.520]  Good throw.
[22:17.620 --> 22:18.260]  He's on fire.
[22:18.720 --> 22:19.060]  Nice.
[22:20.000 --> 22:20.980]  He's on double fire.
[22:21.060 --> 22:21.760]  Dude, that's great.
[22:22.200 --> 22:23.580]  The finest of fires.
[22:25.040 --> 22:25.840]  Nope, nope, nope.
[22:25.840 --> 22:26.280]  Sorry to shoot, Gavin.
[22:26.280 --> 22:29.160]  Let's try to loop him around this bathroom.
[22:30.520 --> 22:32.280]  Uh, he found me.
[22:33.160 --> 22:33.800]  Time to move.
[22:35.180 --> 22:36.640]  Fuckin' bulletin' the shit out of him.
[22:37.580 --> 22:38.840]  Pew, pew, pew, pew, bitch.
[22:39.020 --> 22:39.480]  Pew, pew.
[22:39.680 --> 22:40.140]  Fall, fall.
[22:40.400 --> 22:41.020]  Oh, we got him already?
[22:41.180 --> 22:42.260]  That was fuckin' awesome.
[22:43.000 --> 22:43.720]  Great job.
[22:43.940 --> 22:44.660]  Holy shit.
[22:45.640 --> 22:46.760]  Okay, I'm covering.
[22:49.260 --> 22:50.380]  Oh, shit, is that my blood?
[22:50.500 --> 22:51.280]  Can somebody pick that up?
[22:52.140 --> 22:52.860]  I'm gonna need that later.
[22:53.880 --> 22:55.160]  Did someone put that back into me?
[22:55.760 --> 22:56.080]  Yeah.
[22:57.080 --> 22:59.760]  Nick gifted me the wonders of speed again.
[23:00.600 --> 23:02.240]  Oh, now we're talkin'.
[23:02.240 --> 23:03.580]  Gavin, Gavin, these are uppers.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.100]  You're gonna wanna take these and then drive a truck.
[23:09.680 --> 23:12.320]  Alright, uh, Geoff, heal and take a med pack.
[23:13.240 --> 23:14.040]  Alright, I'll do that.
[23:14.320 --> 23:15.540]  Both of you should heal and take a med pack.
[23:16.260 --> 23:17.340]  Okay, I think there's only two of it.
[23:17.500 --> 23:18.160]  They're coming over the fence.
[23:18.180 --> 23:18.960]  They're coming over the fence.
[23:19.960 --> 23:21.280]  Sorry, I thought one of you had a...
[23:22.580 --> 23:23.240]  I'm healin' up.
[23:23.740 --> 23:24.340]  Over the fence.
[23:28.120 --> 23:29.120]  Behind you, Gavin, Andrew.
[23:29.320 --> 23:29.440]  Yep.
[23:29.720 --> 23:30.240]  Thank you.
[23:32.540 --> 23:32.940]  Okay.
[23:34.480 --> 23:36.380]  Ooh, good shootin'.
[23:36.380 --> 23:36.980]  On my knees.
[23:39.320 --> 23:41.280]  Doing what needs to be done to win.
[23:42.000 --> 23:42.400]  Hunter.
[23:44.840 --> 23:45.760]  Watchin' behind us.
[23:46.140 --> 23:46.560]  He's dead.
[23:46.900 --> 23:48.440]  Spitter, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[23:53.420 --> 23:55.020]  Do they get hurt from the goo?
[23:55.360 --> 23:56.120]  Nah, I think so.
[23:56.540 --> 23:57.200]  Oh, they don't?
[23:57.540 --> 23:58.300]  I don't think so.
[23:58.860 --> 24:00.040]  They loves the goo.
[24:03.320 --> 24:06.900]  I think you guys need to get out of this little alley so that we know who comes from behind.
[24:07.060 --> 24:08.760]  That was a tough spot last time.
[24:10.540 --> 24:11.580]  Didn't come from behind.
[24:11.940 --> 24:12.600]  Great pipe bomb.
[24:13.440 --> 24:13.760]  Thank you.
[24:17.480 --> 24:17.920]  Weapons.
[24:18.260 --> 24:19.400]  There's a sniper.
[24:20.040 --> 24:21.560]  There's another, uh...
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.480]  Got a defib.
[24:22.740 --> 24:23.260]  Oh, fuck.
[24:23.340 --> 24:23.760]  Jockey got me.
[24:24.800 --> 24:26.160]  There's an adrenaline shot down there, too.
[24:26.540 --> 24:26.760]  Okay.
[24:28.720 --> 24:29.640]  Adrenaline over here.
[24:29.740 --> 24:30.360]  Hey, Geoff.
[24:30.820 --> 24:32.640]  Will you come over here and grab this defib?
[24:33.540 --> 24:33.680]  Yeah.
[24:35.300 --> 24:35.680]  Cop.
[24:36.780 --> 24:37.620]  Where's over here?
[24:37.940 --> 24:38.780]  Uh, by me.
[24:39.920 --> 24:41.600]  Over back by where we came from.
[24:42.020 --> 24:42.660]  Fuck, hold on.
[24:42.720 --> 24:42.920]  Cop.
[24:43.920 --> 24:44.220]  Okay.
[24:47.230 --> 24:48.330]  Eric, did you see that shot?
[24:48.550 --> 24:48.990]  That was great.
[24:49.490 --> 24:50.330]  That was great.
[24:51.710 --> 24:52.150]  Thank you.
[24:54.710 --> 24:55.570]  There you go.
[24:55.650 --> 24:56.250]  Alright, let's go.
[24:56.550 --> 24:57.290]  You want me to heal you up?
[24:57.870 --> 24:59.030]  Or actually, you have adrenaline.
[25:00.090 --> 25:01.370]  Yeah, I was saving it for when we got to the bottom.
[25:01.370 --> 25:04.870]  I can heal you, Geoff, and there's a medkit in the thing, so I can grab that.
[25:09.710 --> 25:12.850]  Not the greatest idea to do that there, but it's fine.
[25:13.230 --> 25:13.650]  You know what?
[25:15.590 --> 25:16.090]  It's alright.
[25:18.550 --> 25:20.650]  There's another gentleman there if anybody wants that.
[25:21.070 --> 25:22.390]  I can pop mine.
[25:24.830 --> 25:26.890]  Andrew, do you want to take these pills with you?
[25:27.710 --> 25:29.290]  Take your adrenaline, then take these pills.
[25:29.690 --> 25:30.250]  Where's Gavin?
[25:30.330 --> 25:31.590]  I'll take the adrenaline, then take the adrenaline.
[25:31.770 --> 25:32.670]  I'm right in the corner.
[25:34.430 --> 25:35.190]  Ready, Nick?
[25:35.550 --> 25:36.170]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[25:36.590 --> 25:38.250]  Andrew, you can shoot up and then just grab this.
[25:38.910 --> 25:39.150]  Okay.
[25:39.530 --> 25:41.150]  He shoots up, I'll give him this, I'll take the adrenaline.
[25:41.350 --> 25:41.510]  Okay.
[25:41.790 --> 25:43.070]  He wants the adrenaline, so I'm good.
[25:43.070 --> 25:43.570]  I'll take the adrenaline.
[25:44.450 --> 25:45.010]  There you go.
[25:45.570 --> 25:46.250]  Okay, let's go.
[25:46.390 --> 25:46.790]  Off we go.
[25:47.770 --> 25:48.170]  Use it.
[25:48.810 --> 25:49.290]  Let's go.
[25:49.590 --> 25:50.050]  You know it.
[25:50.250 --> 25:52.350]  Don't even need to fight these guys, just run by them.
[25:52.990 --> 25:54.810]  Unless there's a hunter that jumps on Gavin.
[25:55.150 --> 25:55.490]  Right.
[25:55.790 --> 25:56.130]  Charger!
[25:57.110 --> 25:57.750]  Speaking of...
[25:57.750 --> 25:58.050]  Charger.
[25:58.170 --> 25:58.430]  Charger.
[26:00.050 --> 26:03.570]  Okay, well, again, it jumped over the fence, Gavin, right behind us.
[26:03.630 --> 26:04.350]  Did that real bad.
[26:04.610 --> 26:08.390]  If anyone has a pipe bomb or anything along those lines...
[26:08.390 --> 26:08.630]  I do.
[26:09.830 --> 26:10.450]  ...it'd be amazing.
[26:10.990 --> 26:11.390]  I threw it.
[26:12.150 --> 26:12.530]  Thank you.
[26:12.530 --> 26:14.210]  Oh, I have a boomer by all I can use next time.
[26:15.410 --> 26:15.730]  Spittered.
[26:16.750 --> 26:17.350]  Or smokered.
[26:17.850 --> 26:19.750]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[26:20.070 --> 26:21.210]  Okay, that was insane.
[26:21.730 --> 26:23.550]  Oh, did you say spitter when you meant smoker?
[26:23.670 --> 26:23.850]  Yeah.
[26:23.850 --> 26:24.270]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[26:25.830 --> 26:27.870]  Okay, stop shooting me in the back, please.
[26:29.330 --> 26:34.000]  There you go.
[26:34.040 --> 26:34.580]  Almost there.
[26:34.760 --> 26:35.180]  That's smart.
[26:35.820 --> 26:36.480]  Keep it away from us.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.200]  I see it this time.
[26:38.340 --> 26:38.380]  Okay.
[26:38.680 --> 26:39.120]  Are you sure?
[26:40.060 --> 26:40.780]  Oh, yeah.
[26:43.940 --> 26:45.000]  Ow, ow, damn, Geoff.
[26:46.440 --> 26:47.780]  Don't go up the stairs like that and scare me.
[26:47.780 --> 26:50.080]  Every time I come up here, I get shot by Geoff.
[26:50.180 --> 26:53.400]  Yeah, well, you gotta fuckin' learn your lesson.
[26:54.180 --> 26:55.580]  Announce your interest.
[26:56.920 --> 26:57.980]  Zombie killin' here.
[26:58.320 --> 26:59.460]  Who's there, what's your intent?
[26:59.860 --> 27:01.460]  I got a molotov, tell me when to use it.
[27:02.980 --> 27:04.180]  There's a jockey nearby.
[27:08.740 --> 27:10.540]  Oh, gettin' low on ammo, that sucks.
[27:12.420 --> 27:15.240]  Yeah, I grabbed the AK off the table when we were runnin' by.
[27:19.120 --> 27:19.440]  Jockey!
[27:19.840 --> 27:20.160]  Okay.
[27:20.440 --> 27:20.820]  Oh, shit.
[27:20.940 --> 27:21.460]  It's on me, it's on me.
[27:21.780 --> 27:22.180]  I got it.
[27:22.500 --> 27:22.720]  Thank you.
[27:25.080 --> 27:25.400]  Nice.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.460]  Well, why am I doing this to you when Geoff...
[27:27.460 --> 27:28.140]  I don't know.
[27:34.500 --> 27:40.260]  Oh, you know that was a friendly fire?
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.240]  Why are you even asking?
[27:41.900 --> 27:43.860]  It said incapacitated by Nick.
[27:49.480 --> 27:52.000]  That's what I was confused by, because I'm like, Nick's right behind me.
[27:52.740 --> 27:54.780]  He is, he was right behind you with a gun.
[27:54.780 --> 27:57.280]  They use the gun on the back of your head.
[27:59.320 --> 28:00.180]  Takin' pills.
[28:01.340 --> 28:01.860]  Reloading!
[28:02.200 --> 28:03.380]  Geoff, I'm really sorry.
[28:04.160 --> 28:05.480]  Oh, it's okay, it happens.
[28:06.060 --> 28:07.860]  I got 13 bullets left.
[28:08.440 --> 28:09.260]  Yeah, we're good to move.
[28:09.860 --> 28:10.860]  Geoff has about 13 health.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.040]  21.
[28:13.300 --> 28:14.000]  Nice shot.
[28:14.080 --> 28:14.620]  No more bullets.
[28:16.140 --> 28:17.400]  He's on the pan again.
[28:17.840 --> 28:18.260]  Oh!
[28:19.300 --> 28:20.620]  Right in my eye!
[28:22.860 --> 28:24.060]  Okay, I'm throwing a molotov.
[28:25.340 --> 28:27.100]  You're hittin' that wall pretty good.
[28:27.860 --> 28:28.360]  Oh, me?
[28:28.480 --> 28:29.440]  Well, somebody set me on fire.
[28:29.820 --> 28:29.940]  Yeah.
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.680]  That was me, sorry, I couldn't see.
[28:32.480 --> 28:33.520]  So I just...
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.300]  I watched Geoff completely on fire run across my screen.
[28:37.720 --> 28:40.140]  Well, Andrew, you killed Geoff. Congratulations.
[28:40.660 --> 28:40.960]  Thank you.
[28:42.680 --> 28:45.080]  I couldn't see, so I just threw the molotov into the middle of the room.
[28:45.080 --> 28:46.640]  That was absolutely insane.
[28:46.840 --> 28:48.740]  I threw it at the door, because...
[28:48.740 --> 28:49.340]  At the ground!
[28:49.820 --> 28:52.260]  I feel like when I kill somebody, it's a much bigger deal.
[28:52.260 --> 28:55.260]  You know what, that was pretty egregious.
[28:58.220 --> 28:58.880]  He's back.
[28:59.820 --> 29:00.600]  Oh, nice.
[29:02.200 --> 29:03.280]  Oh, there's a witch.
[29:03.660 --> 29:03.760]  Witch.
[29:04.320 --> 29:06.580]  Well, I have a pistol, so let me at her.
[29:07.720 --> 29:09.080]  We don't have to deal with her.
[29:09.080 --> 29:09.180]  Oh!
[29:09.540 --> 29:09.740]  Hunter!
[29:10.800 --> 29:11.180]  Got him.
[29:11.240 --> 29:12.340]  Very nice, very strong.
[29:13.360 --> 29:13.780]  Ow.
[29:18.440 --> 29:19.080]  Where is she?
[29:19.440 --> 29:20.060]  Sorry about that, Nick.
[29:20.660 --> 29:21.220]  It's alright.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.200]  Who shot me?
[29:22.560 --> 29:23.780]  No, it was a zombie that time.
[29:24.180 --> 29:24.480]  Nobody did.
[29:24.660 --> 29:24.780]  Ow.
[29:24.820 --> 29:25.320]  Oh my god.
[29:25.500 --> 29:25.720]  Gavin!
[29:30.500 --> 29:32.000]  We're so close to the end.
[29:32.100 --> 29:32.740]  Gavin, great or good?
[29:33.180 --> 29:33.400]  No.
[29:34.060 --> 29:34.600]  I'm not doing it.
[29:34.600 --> 29:34.980]  Great or good?
[29:35.060 --> 29:35.660]  I'm going back first.
[29:35.660 --> 29:38.500]  This is like in The Walking Dead, when Shane shot Otis.
[29:39.700 --> 29:41.360]  A deep cut from season two.
[29:43.040 --> 29:49.360]  Hey everybody, let's go join Andrew and the relative safety that he's already enjoying in the fucking safe room.
[29:50.980 --> 29:51.420]  You...
[29:52.840 --> 29:53.280]  You...
[29:53.280 --> 29:55.440]  If you guys would have died, we still would have made it.
[29:57.460 --> 29:57.900]  You...
[29:57.900 --> 29:58.780]  Andrew's the insurance.
[29:59.920 --> 30:00.380]  Me what?
[30:00.860 --> 30:01.980]  Me what, Nick?
[30:02.040 --> 30:04.780]  Me what? I turned around to watch the alley and didn't see shit.
[30:05.400 --> 30:06.780]  3,898 take damage.
[30:06.980 --> 30:07.620]  Me what?
[30:08.280 --> 30:11.500]  The shot you don't take is worth 10,000 of the shot you take.
[30:11.900 --> 30:15.060]  Geoff, thoughts on that proverb?
[30:15.060 --> 30:16.320]  Andrew's like, look at how many...
[30:16.320 --> 30:23.220]  Andrew, I don't know that I recognize the proverb, but I will say it's easy to have the most kills when all of your teammates are dead from your bullets.
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.320]  If you just spray and pray, you know, it doesn't matter who you hit.
[30:29.240 --> 30:31.540]  Ask Gavin, he's dead on the ground over here. It's fine.
[30:32.720 --> 30:35.540]  I've just learned I've got to be careful around Geoff when I'm climbing a ladder.
[30:38.720 --> 30:40.080]  Why are you here and what is your intent?
[30:41.020 --> 30:42.140]  Oh wait, it's the same thing.
[30:42.300 --> 30:47.200]  Alright, healing up. Taking health. Taking names. Taking ammo.
[30:47.780 --> 30:49.440]  Healing up. Living with pills.
[30:50.060 --> 30:52.200]  It's 2024, I think that's what we're all trying to do.
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.120]  Live with pills.
[30:54.840 --> 30:56.480]  Geoff, you can take the...
[30:57.020 --> 31:00.260]  Oh, the... somebody's about to shoot me in the back insurance? Yeah, I'll take it.
[31:03.980 --> 31:05.380]  I take it when you're dead.
[31:06.840 --> 31:10.600]  Yeah, do you guys want me to carry this for you until I die and then you can take it?
[31:13.260 --> 31:15.180]  Grabbing it. Watch out, watch out.
[31:16.780 --> 31:17.520]  Ow, Nick.
[31:19.060 --> 31:22.680]  I was trying to protect you, but this is a three round burst, so I'm not going to do that again.
[31:25.020 --> 31:28.700]  It didn't even tell me that you'd shot me there, I just watched you shoot me.
[31:29.880 --> 31:31.120]  Oh no, that was a zombie then.
[31:31.120 --> 31:31.660]  Oh.
[31:33.980 --> 31:34.780]  Oh, Geoff.
[31:35.220 --> 31:40.300]  I'm so scared to fucking fire because everywhere I look is assholes that are alive.
[31:41.040 --> 31:43.020]  Oh, what the hell happened? Where are you?
[31:43.040 --> 31:43.600]  Oh shit!
[31:45.320 --> 31:46.760]  I've got a jockey, thank you.
[31:47.220 --> 31:48.520]  I mean, he just finished you off.
[31:49.580 --> 31:50.560]  Oh yeah, he finished you off.
[31:50.560 --> 31:51.260]  It wasn't...
[31:51.260 --> 31:53.240]  Oh my god.
[31:57.060 --> 31:59.980]  Thanks, Andrew.
[32:01.120 --> 32:01.760]  You're welcome.
[32:01.860 --> 32:03.480]  I'm glad the great good hasn't kicked in yet.
[32:04.480 --> 32:06.000]  We're not near the safe room.
[32:06.180 --> 32:07.480]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[32:08.220 --> 32:10.080]  The eye is the team.
[32:10.320 --> 32:11.220]  Geoff is in spit burning.
[32:11.680 --> 32:12.160]  Yes.
[32:13.400 --> 32:16.480]  Nick went over to help him and it just kept stacking.
[32:17.460 --> 32:17.600]  Yep.
[32:18.440 --> 32:19.220]  Acid, fire.
[32:19.660 --> 32:22.580]  It was jockey, bile, spitter.
[32:22.920 --> 32:23.720]  It was fucked.
[32:24.260 --> 32:25.140]  It was a real sharknado.
[32:25.240 --> 32:26.380]  Yeah, it was a...
[32:27.020 --> 32:27.560]  Molotov in here.
[32:27.760 --> 32:30.300]  It was a fucking all-star medley of getting my ass kicked in.
[32:31.120 --> 32:32.140]  Anyone want a molotov?
[32:32.440 --> 32:32.800]  I ain't now.
[32:32.960 --> 32:33.600]  You're getting your ass kicked.
[32:34.120 --> 32:35.280]  Geoff and Nick don't have one.
[32:36.780 --> 32:37.660]  Oh shit.
[32:38.600 --> 32:39.540]  Oh my god.
[32:39.700 --> 32:40.520]  Found a charger.
[32:41.220 --> 32:42.620]  Oh my god.
[32:42.700 --> 32:43.400]  I'm gonna molly him.
[32:45.500 --> 32:47.120]  Wow, Nick, what a dodge.
[32:48.220 --> 32:49.120]  Oh, nice molly.
[32:49.420 --> 32:51.140]  The fire came down?
[32:51.560 --> 32:52.460]  What the hell?
[32:52.660 --> 32:54.180]  Yeah, unfortunately the fire came down.
[32:54.220 --> 32:55.920]  I rained flames on myself.
[32:55.940 --> 32:56.500]  Don't get in the corner.
[32:56.500 --> 32:59.680]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[32:59.700 --> 33:00.420]  Is the tank dead?
[33:00.420 --> 33:02.040]  No, that's bullshit. I was out of range.
[33:02.900 --> 33:04.680]  No, he is not dead.
[33:05.060 --> 33:05.620]  I guess.
[33:06.820 --> 33:08.100]  My molotov did more harm than good.
[33:09.740 --> 33:10.340]  Geoff, run.
[33:13.420 --> 33:13.980]  He's dead.
[33:14.380 --> 33:14.780]  Nice.
[33:17.840 --> 33:20.060]  Oh, there's a smoker. I see him on the roof.
[33:21.680 --> 33:23.540]  And a spitter. I see him on the roof.
[33:23.860 --> 33:24.400]  Leave us alone.
[33:26.000 --> 33:27.320]  Alright, there you go, Nick.
[33:27.420 --> 33:28.660]  Okay, smoker is still there.
[33:28.800 --> 33:29.720]  Looking good.
[33:30.380 --> 33:31.460]  Gavin, what happened to you?
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.640]  Nice, Andrew. I burnt to death in my own flames.
[33:35.340 --> 33:39.980]  I threw the molotov upstairs and then when I ran downstairs it all rained down on me.
[33:40.940 --> 33:41.960]  Ah, alcohol.
[33:43.320 --> 33:45.280]  Unless someone threw a second molotov.
[33:45.640 --> 33:45.880]  No.
[33:46.420 --> 33:47.460]  Nope. Hunter.
[33:49.640 --> 33:52.640]  I think you would have heard someone go instantly silent and or...
[33:54.440 --> 33:55.700]  Is that a bit of neck pills?
[33:56.020 --> 33:57.480]  An inhale and a yikes.
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.300]  Hey, what the...
[33:59.300 --> 34:00.080]  Oh, thanks.
[34:01.880 --> 34:04.080]  Where did we go from here?
[34:04.680 --> 34:05.440]  From here.
[34:07.520 --> 34:08.140]  He's dead.
[34:09.100 --> 34:11.440]  Okay, we got a horde. Let's just wait it out in here.
[34:11.840 --> 34:12.180]  Horde funnel.
[34:13.900 --> 34:14.520]  Crouch for accuracy.
[34:17.900 --> 34:18.360]  Boomer.
[34:18.860 --> 34:20.440]  Oh, that worked.
[34:23.000 --> 34:23.820]  Nice, Andrew.
[34:25.600 --> 34:26.160]  Uh-oh.
[34:26.740 --> 34:28.440]  We're all reloaded at the exact same moment.
[34:28.720 --> 34:28.920]  Yep.
[34:30.980 --> 34:31.380]  Okay.
[34:32.720 --> 34:33.300]  Alright, we good?
[34:33.860 --> 34:35.180]  I mean, that's debatable, but yeah.
[34:42.770 --> 34:43.970]  Sounds like something's nearby.
[34:44.630 --> 34:45.430]  Oh, nice shot.
[34:55.200 --> 34:56.140]  Spam behind you, Andrew.
[34:56.380 --> 34:56.520]  Go.
[35:00.360 --> 35:02.620]  Ah, there's jockey on my head.
[35:02.920 --> 35:03.560]  Jockey on my head, Geoff.
[35:03.600 --> 35:03.860]  Nice.
[35:04.280 --> 35:04.680]  Shit.
[35:04.820 --> 35:05.220]  Alright, you're good.
[35:09.160 --> 35:11.280]  How is the jockey... Okay, thank you.
[35:11.340 --> 35:12.340]  God damn.
[35:13.000 --> 35:14.200]  Did you see that?
[35:15.240 --> 35:16.420]  Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie.
[35:16.660 --> 35:17.460]  Behind you, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff.
[35:17.600 --> 35:17.900]  Behind you.
[35:17.940 --> 35:23.460]  Well, I will die the next time I go down.
[35:23.760 --> 35:25.400]  Yeah, you're in black and white mode, baby.
[35:25.900 --> 35:26.820]  Do you have pills or heals?
[35:27.560 --> 35:28.460]  I got neither.
[35:29.740 --> 35:30.680]  Uh, what do we got there?
[35:30.680 --> 35:31.400]  Andrew's got plenty.
[35:34.020 --> 35:34.700]  Thanks, Andrew.
[35:35.080 --> 35:35.460]  Welcome.
[35:36.580 --> 35:38.120]  Bunch of shit we can set on fire.
[35:38.120 --> 35:39.280]  And a machete.
[35:39.500 --> 35:40.600]  Can you give that to Geoff, please?
[35:41.880 --> 35:43.080]  What's that? Oh, the pills? Yeah.
[35:43.200 --> 35:44.140]  There you go.
[35:44.280 --> 35:44.620]  Oh, thanks.
[35:46.000 --> 35:46.360]  Ow!
[35:47.620 --> 35:48.280]  Oh, I'm up.
[35:49.120 --> 35:50.260]  I'm over the...
[35:50.260 --> 35:51.180]  Wow, I'm far.
[35:51.400 --> 35:52.080]  Oh, you are over there.
[35:54.540 --> 35:55.520]  You'll be there in no time.
[35:59.860 --> 36:01.780]  It gets so quiet as it gets serious.
[36:01.900 --> 36:02.440]  Oh, there's pink flamingo.
[36:02.460 --> 36:03.540]  Yeah, it's like...
[36:05.380 --> 36:06.640]  It's really locked in.
[36:06.680 --> 36:07.280]  Welcome to hell.
[36:07.820 --> 36:08.460]  Oh, thanks.
[36:08.720 --> 36:10.020]  Holy shit, where are we?
[36:10.020 --> 36:11.420]  Zombies coming in the house.
[36:11.420 --> 36:12.420]  Dude, dude, that's a bad room.
[36:12.540 --> 36:13.360]  It's a bad house.
[36:13.900 --> 36:15.080]  It's a real bad house.
[36:15.660 --> 36:16.360]  The spitter dead?
[36:16.820 --> 36:16.980]  Yeah.
[36:17.580 --> 36:19.380]  This house is having bad vibes.
[36:20.840 --> 36:21.940]  There's a smoker somewhere nearby.
[36:27.260 --> 36:28.220]  Oh, there he is!
[36:29.480 --> 36:31.940]  Ow, ow.
[36:33.620 --> 36:34.380]  Nice shot, Geoff.
[36:35.020 --> 36:36.560]  There's a...
[36:36.560 --> 36:37.780]  ammo pack.
[36:38.140 --> 36:39.260]  Does anybody want my ammo pack?
[36:39.480 --> 36:40.120]  Here, Geoff.
[36:41.860 --> 36:43.780]  I'm gonna put an ammo pack down.
[36:44.040 --> 36:44.960]  Explosive ammo on me.
[36:44.980 --> 36:45.100]  Ah, the jockey!
[36:46.280 --> 36:47.320]  Jock itch.
[36:49.000 --> 36:49.980]  Ah, jockey got me.
[36:49.980 --> 36:50.460]  Geoff's dead.
[36:52.300 --> 36:53.900]  Killed that fucking jockey.
[36:54.340 --> 36:55.080]  Is it still up?
[36:55.940 --> 36:56.960]  No, I think we got it.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.400]  These jockeys are hard to fucking kill in this mode.
[37:00.360 --> 37:02.420]  Okay, explosive ammo at my feet.
[37:07.780 --> 37:09.480]  Gonna group up over here.
[37:10.860 --> 37:11.680]  Explosive ammo.
[37:13.300 --> 37:14.360]  Can this hurt us?
[37:15.260 --> 37:15.800]  I'm not sure.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.440]  I mean, I know it can hurt each other.
[37:19.660 --> 37:20.980]  That much is readily apparent.
[37:28.170 --> 37:32.390]  It's fun to watch Andrew's screen when I'm dead to see how little he communicates.
[37:34.150 --> 37:34.970]  Behind you, Gavin.
[37:35.250 --> 37:37.370]  He's doing so... he's so far ahead of the game.
[37:37.590 --> 37:38.210]  Like, so far...
[37:38.210 --> 37:40.070]  Turn around and you guys are like a mile back.
[37:40.550 --> 37:41.610]  I know where you guys are.
[37:42.210 --> 37:43.890]  Listen, I know where they are in relation to me.
[37:43.970 --> 37:44.890]  You know where we are.
[37:44.950 --> 37:46.110]  We don't know where you are.
[37:47.410 --> 37:48.530]  It's for you.
[37:49.870 --> 37:51.590]  Go ahead, say it.
[37:51.850 --> 37:52.370]  Let him know.
[37:52.930 --> 37:53.290]  Go on.
[37:53.370 --> 37:54.030]  For your greater good.
[37:57.210 --> 38:02.070]  I had to move. I was in the street, so I have to push to a room in which I'll have corners covered.
[38:02.210 --> 38:04.790]  You want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.
[38:05.750 --> 38:09.350]  Nick has literally one health.
[38:10.010 --> 38:10.690]  I'm moving.
[38:10.870 --> 38:12.770]  Nick has zero health.
[38:13.450 --> 38:14.410]  No, I got plus two.
[38:14.590 --> 38:15.490]  Plus. I got plus.
[38:15.490 --> 38:16.390]  That's great.
[38:17.710 --> 38:18.790]  Is that Hunter down?
[38:19.970 --> 38:21.150]  No, he's still up.
[38:21.190 --> 38:21.770]  There he goes.
[38:23.190 --> 38:23.810]  Good hit.
[38:24.270 --> 38:24.850]  Hunter's down.
[38:25.390 --> 38:25.930]  Getting Geoff.
[38:27.130 --> 38:27.450]  Hey!
[38:28.490 --> 38:30.130]  My heart's beating in my chest.
[38:33.690 --> 38:34.690]  Uh-oh.
[38:34.750 --> 38:35.370]  It's for the greater good.
[38:35.630 --> 38:35.970]  Oh, no.
[38:37.750 --> 38:40.630]  I'm so screwed. Holy shitballs.
[38:41.130 --> 38:42.750]  Andrew, tell us what's going on.
[38:43.090 --> 38:44.070]  Get those pills. Use them.
[38:44.570 --> 38:46.750]  Did you just say I didn't say I was going after him?
[38:46.830 --> 38:48.030]  Because I said like eight times.
[38:48.030 --> 38:48.690]  Oh, did he? Okay.
[38:48.790 --> 38:51.210]  My apologies. I was going after Geoff's earlier comment.
[38:51.450 --> 38:52.950]  No, you know what? That's on me.
[38:53.290 --> 38:55.450]  I can't fucking see. I don't know what I'm doing.
[38:55.550 --> 38:55.830]  I'm sorry.
[38:55.830 --> 38:56.270]  It's okay.
[38:56.390 --> 38:57.610]  I'm trying not to shoot anybody.
[38:58.190 --> 38:59.150]  Well, that's the...
[39:00.130 --> 39:01.210]  Nick's doing a good job.
[39:01.490 --> 39:01.950]  Nick's helping.
[39:03.090 --> 39:04.230]  I didn't shoot him, did I?
[39:04.990 --> 39:06.010]  Two or three times.
[39:06.690 --> 39:07.550]  No, I don't think I did.
[39:07.710 --> 39:08.690]  It said protected him.
[39:09.070 --> 39:10.750]  That was the last thing that happened.
[39:11.030 --> 39:11.950]  No, no, no, no.
[39:12.010 --> 39:13.030]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[39:13.030 --> 39:13.550]  No.
[39:15.730 --> 39:17.010]  You know what, Andrew?
[39:17.390 --> 39:20.290]  I take it all back, and I'd like to apologize for being an asshole.
[39:21.350 --> 39:22.050]  So good.
[39:23.430 --> 39:25.790]  No, no, I'm doing that also for Eric's sake if I shot Geoff.
[39:25.830 --> 39:26.810]  I don't think I did, but I might have.
[39:28.770 --> 39:31.030]  Everything's black and white, and my heart's beating in my ears.
[39:31.130 --> 39:31.630]  Let's get mad.
[39:34.770 --> 39:35.110]  Oh, yeah.
[39:36.210 --> 39:36.570]  Yeah.
[39:37.070 --> 39:37.790]  Holy fuck.
[39:37.810 --> 39:38.190]  There you go.
[39:39.550 --> 39:40.910]  Gotta make something happen there.
[39:40.910 --> 39:44.250]  It's, you know, probably not optimal, but at least it's something.
[39:45.970 --> 39:46.770]  Hey, be careful.
[39:46.930 --> 39:47.310]  Zombie, zombie.
[39:47.830 --> 39:50.310]  Do we go down the manhole?
[39:50.510 --> 39:51.770]  Yeah, this part sucks.
[39:52.570 --> 39:53.990]  Be careful. Friendly fire here.
[39:55.190 --> 39:55.730]  Oh, shit.
[39:57.030 --> 39:58.070]  Oh, no. Spitter.
[39:58.270 --> 39:59.850]  Go forward. Forward. Forward. Forward.
[40:03.350 --> 40:04.870]  Stop firing. Stop firing.
[40:05.210 --> 40:06.210]  I am stopping.
[40:06.990 --> 40:07.950]  Hunter, hunter, hunter.
[40:08.470 --> 40:09.290]  We're stuck.
[40:09.670 --> 40:10.470]  Fell on the spitter.
[40:10.570 --> 40:11.650]  You're not so stuck you can't get me.
[40:12.250 --> 40:12.970]  We're down.
[40:13.150 --> 40:14.410]  Can we climb back up?
[40:14.530 --> 40:15.290]  Oh, you're in here. Okay.
[40:17.950 --> 40:19.750]  I was like, well, at least I have a med pack.
[40:19.830 --> 40:20.890]  It's explosive ammo.
[40:21.910 --> 40:23.270]  Don't feel great about it.
[40:23.370 --> 40:24.110]  I'm putting it down.
[40:24.310 --> 40:25.390]  It's a difference in medicine.
[40:26.170 --> 40:27.630]  Nick has one health.
[40:30.490 --> 40:31.650]  The last one health.
[40:32.490 --> 40:33.690]  We're gonna climb up.
[40:34.430 --> 40:35.130]  Oh, shit.
[40:38.470 --> 40:38.910]  Hunter's down.
[40:38.910 --> 40:39.630]  I'll get him up.
[40:40.170 --> 40:40.890]  You got him, Nick?
[40:41.650 --> 40:41.870]  Yeah.
[40:41.990 --> 40:42.910]  There's a guy behind you.
[40:45.190 --> 40:45.910]  Oh, God.
[40:46.110 --> 40:47.490]  Get him, Geoff.
[40:48.270 --> 40:49.550]  They're still running around down here.
[40:50.150 --> 40:50.470]  I hear them.
[40:50.550 --> 40:51.070]  It's so dark.
[40:51.630 --> 40:52.590]  It's a bad room.
[40:53.290 --> 40:54.750]  Well, it's easier to see in black and white.
[40:54.890 --> 40:55.270]  Let's get up.
[40:55.590 --> 40:56.490]  Yeah, Nick's got night vision.
[40:56.990 --> 40:57.570]  Yeah, no kidding.
[40:57.750 --> 40:59.790]  Oh, yeah. It's way easier to see in black and white.
[41:05.020 --> 41:06.280]  Oh, my God.
[41:06.880 --> 41:07.880]  Nick, you have a pipe bomb.
[41:09.140 --> 41:10.260]  Nick, you have a pipe bomb.
[41:10.260 --> 41:11.080]  Oh, I do have a pipe bomb.
[41:11.240 --> 41:11.900]  Here you go, fellas.
[41:11.900 --> 41:12.640]  My last act.
[41:13.400 --> 41:14.800]  I don't know if you got it out in time.
[41:14.980 --> 41:15.740]  I don't know if I did either.
[41:15.980 --> 41:16.320]  Hunter, Andrew.
[41:17.080 --> 41:17.340]  Yeah.
[41:20.100 --> 41:20.540]  Oh, no.
[41:21.940 --> 41:22.620]  That's just Geoff.
[41:22.760 --> 41:23.620]  Did the pipe bomb go out?
[41:24.240 --> 41:25.220]  Geoff went behind it.
[41:27.400 --> 41:28.160]  Geoff, do you have a pipe?
[41:28.320 --> 41:29.280]  I'm gonna...
[41:30.040 --> 41:31.440]  I just fell over.
[41:31.740 --> 41:34.720]  No, I would have...
[41:36.820 --> 41:38.380]  Andrew's got his face dumped in.
[41:40.300 --> 41:40.740]  Okay.
[41:41.880 --> 41:42.640]  Hey, check it out.
[41:42.680 --> 41:42.840]  Help.
[41:44.080 --> 41:44.360]  God.
[41:44.560 --> 41:44.700]  Yeah.
[41:45.560 --> 41:46.300]  This time.
[41:47.500 --> 41:48.380]  All right.
[41:48.400 --> 41:49.060]  We learned a lot.
[41:50.500 --> 41:50.940]  We...
[41:50.940 --> 41:52.880]  I think we've learned not to trust each other.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.340]  I think we've learned...
[41:54.340 --> 41:56.220]  I don't know that we learned positive things.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.580]  Gavin, what are you rocking with?
[41:58.980 --> 42:00.180]  What am I rocket with?
[42:03.040 --> 42:04.380]  What's your loadout, Gavin?
[42:04.720 --> 42:07.440]  I got a combat shotgun.
[42:08.320 --> 42:08.600]  Okay.
[42:13.060 --> 42:14.540]  Geoff, you wanna take the health?
[42:15.140 --> 42:15.620]  Take this, Ray.
[42:21.280 --> 42:21.780]  Whoa.
[42:25.180 --> 42:26.340]  Did that zombie pop in here for you?
[42:27.620 --> 42:28.240]  Sure did.
[42:34.800 --> 42:35.300]  Org.
[42:38.140 --> 42:39.420]  Dropping down off the highway.
[42:41.020 --> 42:41.840]  Gavin's already down.
[42:41.840 --> 42:46.040]  I should probably just heal at this checkpoint because I don't have enough.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.880]  I'm gonna pick you up, buddy.
[42:48.140 --> 42:48.380]  Okay.
[42:50.120 --> 42:50.640]  Smoker.
[42:53.740 --> 42:54.600]  Nice shot.
[42:55.160 --> 42:55.880]  Thank you.
[42:56.440 --> 42:57.400]  That was a nice shot, Andrew.
[42:58.020 --> 42:58.640]  Thank you.
[42:59.660 --> 43:00.100]  Hunter!
[43:00.820 --> 43:01.500]  Oh, God.
[43:02.140 --> 43:03.400]  Oh, you saved me so fast.
[43:03.540 --> 43:04.540]  Oh, God.
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.480]  Jesus Christ.
[43:13.620 --> 43:14.860]  That was a bunch of dickheads.
[43:15.520 --> 43:15.900]  Thanks, Gavin.
[43:15.940 --> 43:16.100]  God.
[43:18.700 --> 43:19.740]  Alright, I've got to heal.
[43:19.800 --> 43:21.500]  I'm gonna go grab ammo from the safe room again.
[43:27.200 --> 43:27.560]  Jockey.
[43:29.780 --> 43:32.460]  Yeah, the problem with the longer we stick around, the worse it gets.
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.460]  Yep, you gotta move fast.
[43:35.220 --> 43:35.580]  Tank!
[43:37.000 --> 43:37.740]  Yeah, that's bad.
[43:38.080 --> 43:38.920]  Alright, I've got a molly.
[43:38.940 --> 43:39.460]  Oh, ow.
[43:40.700 --> 43:41.360]  Where is he?
[43:42.100 --> 43:45.520]  Oh, there he is. He's over by the white van.
[43:46.820 --> 43:47.540]  White van?
[43:47.860 --> 43:48.920]  I'm not...
[43:50.520 --> 43:51.260]  Flame on.
[43:54.460 --> 43:55.480]  That was not...
[43:56.180 --> 43:58.500]  Look, what can you do in that situation, you know?
[43:58.780 --> 43:59.540]  I... I don't know.
[44:04.760 --> 44:06.440]  I expected him to keep... Okay.
[44:07.960 --> 44:08.740]  He's crossing.
[44:09.000 --> 44:10.480]  I shot... Okay, that time I shot Gavin.
[44:12.080 --> 44:13.380]  Alright, I definitely moved.
[44:13.680 --> 44:15.940]  Okay, he's down. I got Nick. If you want to get Geoff, Gavin.
[44:16.120 --> 44:17.040]  I got Geoff. Tank is... Yeah.
[44:17.040 --> 44:17.220]  Yeah.
[44:17.940 --> 44:20.620]  What's up with you down there? Come on, let's get up.
[44:20.700 --> 44:21.540]  Hey, thanks, Michelle.
[44:22.360 --> 44:23.860]  At least we got the tank out of the way.
[44:24.120 --> 44:24.980]  Yeah, that's nice.
[44:25.100 --> 44:26.920]  Yeah. We're all alive after it.
[44:27.700 --> 44:28.080]  Yeah.
[44:28.340 --> 44:29.840]  That's a step better than last time.
[44:30.780 --> 44:32.520]  When Gavin lit himself a blaze.
[44:33.020 --> 44:33.540]  That's true.
[44:34.180 --> 44:35.540]  Let's just haul ass.
[44:36.240 --> 44:38.960]  We spent way too much time in this little area dicking around earlier.
[44:40.780 --> 44:41.540]  Got a machete.
[44:44.720 --> 44:45.160]  Move.
[44:47.840 --> 44:48.360]  Reloading.
[44:57.020 --> 44:58.060]  Thank you.
[44:58.420 --> 44:58.720]  Okay.
[44:59.760 --> 45:00.300]  Let's push.
[45:02.140 --> 45:03.620]  I'm going to pop these bad boys.
[45:08.780 --> 45:09.160]  Charger.
[45:09.780 --> 45:10.700]  Where did he go?
[45:11.540 --> 45:11.920]  Jockey.
[45:12.860 --> 45:13.880]  Did you get those pills, Gavin?
[45:14.440 --> 45:14.680]  Yeah.
[45:14.840 --> 45:15.340]  Fuck off.
[45:16.100 --> 45:17.040]  Piece of shit.
[45:21.440 --> 45:21.960]  Spitter.
[45:23.760 --> 45:25.280]  I still don't know where the charger is.
[45:26.020 --> 45:26.500]  Shitty.
[45:27.240 --> 45:28.780]  I hit Geoff? How?
[45:29.640 --> 45:32.260]  How on earth did I hit Geoff? I'm on the fucking ground.
[45:32.680 --> 45:34.520]  Alright. Calm down. I'm not mad at you.
[45:34.820 --> 45:36.000]  I'm mad at myself, Geoff.
[45:36.780 --> 45:39.920]  I'm mad at myself, Geoff.
[45:41.920 --> 45:42.960]  Everyone to the corner.
[45:44.620 --> 45:45.480]  Trying to crossfire.
[45:50.320 --> 45:50.800]  Reloading.
[45:53.720 --> 45:54.020]  Alright.
[45:55.940 --> 45:56.820]  Catching up with Andrew.
[45:59.460 --> 46:00.020]  Thanks.
[46:08.030 --> 46:08.910]  Good job.
[46:10.090 --> 46:10.950]  Keep moving.
[46:12.830 --> 46:17.730]  Alright. We had a really big fight in this room last time.
[46:18.250 --> 46:19.670]  Should I throw the can?
[46:21.670 --> 46:22.690]  Not yet.
[46:23.650 --> 46:24.210]  Reloading.
[46:24.710 --> 46:26.470]  Maybe at the window over there.
[46:26.990 --> 46:28.110]  Out this window at the back?
[46:28.770 --> 46:29.230]  Yeah.
[46:32.390 --> 46:32.950]  Oh!
[46:37.340 --> 46:37.780]  Jockey.
[46:37.980 --> 46:40.260]  I hear it.
[46:40.260 --> 46:40.880]  Charge up!
[46:42.060 --> 46:42.500]  Ah!
[46:46.170 --> 46:48.070]  Oh, no. Hunter. Jockey got me.
[46:48.790 --> 46:49.970]  I'm down, but I killed him.
[46:50.590 --> 46:51.090]  Thanks, Kevin.
[46:51.610 --> 46:53.310]  Well, the jockey is very much alive.
[46:55.750 --> 46:57.210]  You can probably hop down and help him.
[47:00.980 --> 47:01.860]  And we're with you.
[47:04.420 --> 47:04.860]  Hurt.
[47:05.800 --> 47:07.840]  Oh, my God.
[47:07.920 --> 47:08.240]  Oh!
[47:08.240 --> 47:09.920]  I'm so sorry.
[47:10.560 --> 47:11.000]  Pills.
[47:13.140 --> 47:17.100]  I was shooting a dude, and you just lined right up in me.
[47:18.320 --> 47:19.780]  Just get the adrenaline.
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.300]  I had a propane tank in my hand briefly.
[47:24.840 --> 47:25.560]  Where'd it go?
[47:26.120 --> 47:26.740]  It got shot.
[47:30.770 --> 47:32.430]  Was it shot while it was in your hands?
[47:32.530 --> 47:32.710]  Yep.
[47:33.710 --> 47:34.150]  What?
[47:35.730 --> 47:36.990]  I didn't know that could happen.
[47:37.350 --> 47:37.730]  Oh, yeah.
[47:38.150 --> 47:38.830]  That's cool.
[47:40.630 --> 47:41.510]  And also, sorry.
[47:41.610 --> 47:42.590]  It's cool if you're not Gavin.
[47:44.710 --> 47:47.930]  Alright, I'm 28, and I've got death next.
[47:47.950 --> 47:51.030]  You wish you were 28. You're like 39 at this point.
[47:52.430 --> 47:53.190]  Man, I feel it.
[47:55.770 --> 47:56.970]  I'm thankful of it.
[47:57.670 --> 47:57.790]  Oh.
[47:59.390 --> 48:00.770]  There's a rocket launcher. A grenade launcher.
[48:01.570 --> 48:02.770]  Stop hanging out there.
[48:03.450 --> 48:05.090]  I'm trying to get through the fucking thing.
[48:05.250 --> 48:06.390]  I think I have to crouch through it.
[48:06.550 --> 48:07.070]  Yeah, it's a no-go.
[48:07.070 --> 48:07.370]  It's a no-go.
[48:11.290 --> 48:13.770]  Does anyone know of any health or pills?
[48:14.950 --> 48:16.930]  I got a Molotov. I can set you on fire.
[48:19.130 --> 48:20.450]  Ammo in here if you need it.
[48:23.870 --> 48:25.930]  The grenade launcher is going to be so dangerous.
[48:26.590 --> 48:28.770]  Yeah, I don't have a gun other than a grenade launcher.
[48:32.230 --> 48:33.690]  Classic last resort weapon.
[48:35.030 --> 48:35.770]  Andrew, right behind you.
[48:36.150 --> 48:36.990]  Yep, yep. Thanks.
[48:42.100 --> 48:43.320]  Oh, my God.
[48:43.700 --> 48:45.140]  Oh, my God.
[48:45.140 --> 48:45.400]  I'm dead.
[48:45.740 --> 48:49.600]  I'm not sure how that happened. I don't think that's true.
[48:49.920 --> 48:52.620]  Did you kill me? When I looked at your health, you were also dead.
[48:53.160 --> 48:55.000]  I think I'm going to have to check the tape on that one.
[48:56.500 --> 48:57.540]  Good news, we got them.
[48:58.480 --> 49:00.080]  Don't worry, Andrew's got this.
[49:00.280 --> 49:00.980]  Great or good or whatever.
[49:02.320 --> 49:03.620]  Hey, there's somebody in a...
[49:03.620 --> 49:04.320]  Oh, Andrew the Smith.
[49:04.320 --> 49:04.660]  Oh, there he goes.
[49:05.280 --> 49:06.240]  Andrew the Horde.
[49:08.000 --> 49:08.440]  It's rough.
[49:08.440 --> 49:08.800]  It's real bad.
[49:09.460 --> 49:11.320]  You got this. You got this, Andrew.
[49:11.800 --> 49:12.980]  You're doing tremendously, though.
[49:14.340 --> 49:15.660]  Andrew's so good at this.
[49:15.900 --> 49:16.620]  Look at that.
[49:17.660 --> 49:18.080]  Look at that.
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.240]  Andrew is the ringer.
[49:20.300 --> 49:20.920]  Nick's back.
[49:22.220 --> 49:23.920]  Shut the door so one of us can spawn.
[49:25.160 --> 49:25.440]  Oh, yeah.
[49:25.960 --> 49:26.780]  I don't know if that's a thing.
[49:27.600 --> 49:28.180]  I'll do it anyway.
[49:29.400 --> 49:29.980]  Fuck you.
[49:31.360 --> 49:32.500]  Did you hear that, Nick? He was talking to you.
[49:32.680 --> 49:34.380]  No. No, it was a zombie.
[49:35.100 --> 49:35.740]  Probably deserved.
[49:36.360 --> 49:39.640]  Hey, Gavin, yesterday when I yelled at you, I was thinking about a zombie.
[49:45.020 --> 49:45.380]  Yeah.
[49:45.640 --> 49:47.180]  I was not trying to yell at Gavin yesterday.
[49:47.400 --> 49:47.560]  Yeah.
[49:47.660 --> 49:48.680]  I don't know if I ever yelled at Gavin.
[49:51.420 --> 49:51.780]  Alright.
[49:52.420 --> 49:53.660]  Probably not about anything serious.
[49:54.160 --> 49:54.400]  No.
[50:02.710 --> 50:03.070]  Okay.
[50:04.810 --> 50:05.250]  Okay.
[50:08.330 --> 50:09.410]  Oh, Jesus.
[50:09.610 --> 50:12.470]  I hate this stupid steward section.
[50:12.690 --> 50:13.130]  It's intense.
[50:15.150 --> 50:16.330]  Alright, let's full balls it.
[50:17.010 --> 50:17.210]  Yeah.
[50:17.590 --> 50:18.190]  Alright, Gav.
[50:18.670 --> 50:21.010]  We're going to have to support them in the best way we know how.
[50:21.410 --> 50:23.370]  Let's point out everything we think they do wrong.
[50:24.990 --> 50:27.290]  Oh, balls.
[50:28.250 --> 50:29.650]  Dammit, Nick, you ran at it.
[50:31.210 --> 50:33.770]  I was just trying to get out of the goo and, of course, I found him.
[50:34.250 --> 50:35.210]  Alright, I'm with you, Andrew.
[50:36.070 --> 50:37.810]  Gav, just be careful with the shooting.
[50:38.410 --> 50:38.590]  Yeah.
[50:40.950 --> 50:42.590]  I'm just going to aim for the section.
[50:43.450 --> 50:44.350]  Aim at their feet.
[50:46.890 --> 50:48.990]  Actually, aim at the section of zombie that isn't in there.
[50:49.430 --> 50:50.630]  I'm going to get rid of this, too, while I'm at it.
[50:50.630 --> 50:51.510]  That's also a good idea.
[50:53.650 --> 50:54.910]  Putting fire rounds down.
[50:55.350 --> 50:55.610]  Hunter.
[50:56.930 --> 50:57.250]  Horde.
[50:57.950 --> 50:58.650]  Getting to a corner.
[50:58.650 --> 50:59.230]  Over here.
[50:59.230 --> 51:00.530]  Come over here.
[51:01.110 --> 51:01.550]  Back up.
[51:01.690 --> 51:01.890]  Back up.
[51:01.930 --> 51:02.190]  Back up.
[51:02.230 --> 51:02.690]  Back up.
[51:03.610 --> 51:04.890]  You're going to set yourself on fire.
[51:05.890 --> 51:06.290]  Nah.
[51:09.590 --> 51:10.970]  Yeah, did you consider nuh-uh?
[51:11.570 --> 51:12.690]  Oh, well, I didn't.
[51:13.350 --> 51:14.930]  Well, nuh-uh seemed to work that time.
[51:15.190 --> 51:18.090]  Nuh-uh clause, but Nick definitely liked it.
[51:18.090 --> 51:18.210]  Alright, boys.
[51:18.310 --> 51:19.310]  I think it might be time to move.
[51:19.790 --> 51:20.010]  Andrew!
[51:20.210 --> 51:20.330]  Oh!
[51:21.730 --> 51:22.010]  Nice.
[51:23.090 --> 51:24.650]  Andrew's one hit away from death.
[51:25.490 --> 51:26.750]  I see why I mean Nick is also.
[51:27.370 --> 51:27.610]  Hunter.
[51:28.230 --> 51:28.630]  Ah!
[51:29.350 --> 51:30.470]  Well, I saved.
[51:30.710 --> 51:31.010]  Wow.
[51:31.170 --> 51:32.690]  Didn't count as a hit.
[51:32.970 --> 51:34.590]  Dude, didn't even do any damage.
[51:35.190 --> 51:35.570]  Boomer.
[51:36.310 --> 51:37.370]  Yeah, yeah, let's wait a second.
[51:37.410 --> 51:40.130]  Be careful because it will cause the car alarm.
[51:40.470 --> 51:40.910]  Let's pull it.
[51:41.010 --> 51:41.430]  Let's pull it.
[51:44.910 --> 51:45.530]  Fuck me.
[51:46.010 --> 51:48.290]  You piece of shit.
[51:48.630 --> 51:48.830]  Fuck.
[51:48.950 --> 51:49.370]  Where are you?
[51:54.010 --> 51:54.410]  Okay.
[51:54.750 --> 51:55.450]  Boomer in the distance.
[51:55.450 --> 51:56.330]  It's far back.
[51:56.810 --> 51:56.910]  Yep.
[51:56.990 --> 51:57.210]  Okay.
[51:57.710 --> 51:58.330]  Should we keep going?
[51:59.030 --> 51:59.210]  Yep.
[51:59.850 --> 52:01.210]  Careful of that boomer.
[52:03.770 --> 52:04.250]  Jesus.
[52:11.810 --> 52:12.590]  Oh, Nick.
[52:12.730 --> 52:13.630]  Oh, come on.
[52:13.750 --> 52:14.410]  Oh, Nick's down.
[52:14.590 --> 52:15.390]  A side one got me.
[52:15.810 --> 52:16.610]  Dogpile on Nick.
[52:16.730 --> 52:17.350]  That's bad.
[52:20.150 --> 52:20.510]  Alright.
[52:21.090 --> 52:21.330]  It's alright.
[52:21.410 --> 52:24.130]  It gave Andrew an opportunity to kill them because they were destroyed.
[52:24.770 --> 52:25.950]  All part of the plan.
[52:28.150 --> 52:30.590]  You guys are doing great.
[52:32.630 --> 52:32.950]  Molotov?
[52:32.990 --> 52:33.270]  Hmm.
[52:33.910 --> 52:34.830]  Two molotovs in there.
[52:35.070 --> 52:35.350]  Looks like.
[52:36.930 --> 52:37.890]  I'll cover us for now.
[52:38.090 --> 52:38.990]  Hunter at the top.
[52:39.310 --> 52:39.350]  Hunter up there.
[52:39.810 --> 52:40.610]  Yeah, there you go.
[52:41.490 --> 52:41.830]  Got him.
[52:42.250 --> 52:42.550]  He's on us.
[52:42.550 --> 52:42.870]  Reloading.
[52:43.970 --> 52:44.950]  Guy running right at you, Nick.
[52:45.110 --> 52:45.410]  Okay.
[52:45.890 --> 52:46.190]  I know.
[52:47.230 --> 52:48.090]  Look at this unit.
[52:48.130 --> 52:48.330]  Thank you.
[52:48.710 --> 52:49.690]  Safe room's so close.
[52:50.930 --> 52:51.310]  Gotta be.
[52:51.330 --> 52:51.950]  Alright, we'll take those.
[52:53.330 --> 52:54.070]  Watch that left side.
[52:54.110 --> 52:54.370]  Wait, what?
[52:55.150 --> 52:55.710]  Gotta go up.
[52:55.730 --> 52:56.010]  There you go.
[52:56.070 --> 52:56.850]  Just go up the stairs.
[52:57.030 --> 52:57.290]  Go up.
[52:57.390 --> 52:58.410]  Come on, Andrew, I'll cover you.
[52:58.930 --> 52:59.550]  You go up.
[52:59.550 --> 52:59.830]  You go up.
[52:59.890 --> 53:00.270]  You go up.
[53:00.490 --> 53:01.290]  Someone's gotta go up.
[53:01.410 --> 53:02.170]  Well, yeah.
[53:03.650 --> 53:04.130]  Oh, no.
[53:04.190 --> 53:04.450]  Charger.
[53:04.590 --> 53:04.770]  Charger.
[53:04.870 --> 53:05.130]  Go down.
[53:05.230 --> 53:05.550]  Go down.
[53:05.610 --> 53:05.930]  Go down.
[53:06.130 --> 53:06.830]  Oh, shit, Nick.
[53:07.670 --> 53:07.990]  No!
[53:09.050 --> 53:10.530]  I hit us both on the ladder, I guess.
[53:10.610 --> 53:11.050]  Nick got it.
[53:11.090 --> 53:11.570]  He killed it.
[53:12.490 --> 53:12.670]  Yeah.
[53:12.950 --> 53:13.330]  And Nick's dead.
[53:13.970 --> 53:14.130]  Yeah.
[53:14.330 --> 53:14.650]  Oh.
[53:16.450 --> 53:17.370]  You guys like this part?
[53:17.470 --> 53:18.010]  You need to do it again.
[53:19.550 --> 53:19.870]  Yeah.
[53:20.370 --> 53:20.810]  Oh, good.
[53:23.010 --> 53:23.330]  Healing.
[53:23.950 --> 53:24.270]  Healing.
[53:25.390 --> 53:25.710]  Healing.
[53:28.410 --> 53:29.510]  And then a good heal.
[53:31.290 --> 53:35.050]  Alright, this time, let's get past this section without any injury.
[53:36.110 --> 53:36.770]  I like it.
[53:38.870 --> 53:41.550]  I'll stick with the AK this time and see if that makes a difference.
[53:45.670 --> 53:47.650]  Okay, opening and then moving to the right.
[53:48.930 --> 53:50.090]  And all the way to the right.
[53:52.670 --> 53:53.550]  Moving to the right.
[53:53.790 --> 53:54.330]  All the way to the right.
[53:54.330 --> 53:54.890]  I'm by the door.
[53:55.310 --> 53:56.490]  Not firing my gun.
[53:58.430 --> 53:58.910]  Crouching.
[53:58.990 --> 53:59.730]  Firing my gun.
[53:59.730 --> 54:01.090]  Stop firing.
[54:01.310 --> 54:01.790]  Stood up.
[54:02.450 --> 54:02.930]  Shot.
[54:03.790 --> 54:04.270]  Crouched.
[54:05.210 --> 54:06.170]  Being communicating.
[54:06.350 --> 54:06.830]  Over there.
[54:09.390 --> 54:10.350]  Being communicating.
[54:10.730 --> 54:12.650]  Being communicating, Gavin.
[54:14.570 --> 54:15.790]  Rebring it up, idiot.
[54:18.190 --> 54:18.970]  A tank.
[54:19.110 --> 54:19.450]  Again.
[54:19.870 --> 54:20.010]  Yep.
[54:21.150 --> 54:21.910]  Anyone have fire?
[54:22.990 --> 54:23.470]  Goddamnit.
[54:23.550 --> 54:24.810]  No, but I have Boomer Bile.
[54:24.950 --> 54:25.610]  I can hit him with it.
[54:25.730 --> 54:26.270]  And a horde.
[54:26.450 --> 54:27.650]  We got a tank and a horde.
[54:28.050 --> 54:28.810]  Well, Gavin's down.
[54:29.330 --> 54:30.170]  I'm going to throw that.
[54:31.110 --> 54:31.550]  And Geoff.
[54:31.770 --> 54:32.210]  Geoff's down.
[54:33.330 --> 54:33.930]  Just Geoff.
[54:34.150 --> 54:34.530]  Not Gavin.
[54:37.230 --> 54:38.090]  Sorry about that, Nick.
[54:38.350 --> 54:38.990]  That's okay.
[54:40.530 --> 54:40.890]  Tank.
[54:42.470 --> 54:45.650]  I stood up so that the tank could run over and punch me in the dick.
[54:46.090 --> 54:47.270]  Oh, good fire.
[54:47.530 --> 54:51.290]  Yeah, but if I hadn't gotten you up, he would have punched you in the head.
[54:52.070 --> 54:52.630]  Appreciate it.
[54:54.250 --> 54:55.590]  He punched you in the back that time.
[54:56.670 --> 54:57.850]  Yeah, he really likes to hit you.
[54:59.970 --> 55:00.330]  Whoa.
[55:02.670 --> 55:03.390]  Alright, he's dead.
[55:03.810 --> 55:04.450]  No, he's not.
[55:04.550 --> 55:05.210]  What am I talking about?
[55:05.390 --> 55:05.790]  Now he's dead.
[55:09.190 --> 55:10.710]  Getting some ammo.
[55:11.170 --> 55:11.830]  Back in the safe room.
[55:12.010 --> 55:12.370]  Oh, jeez.
[55:12.750 --> 55:13.430]  Good dog.
[55:14.210 --> 55:15.130]  Dog scared me too.
[55:16.870 --> 55:17.830]  Somebody rang the doorbell.
[55:18.050 --> 55:18.670]  I'll just let me know.
[55:19.030 --> 55:19.470]  He's a good boy.
[55:23.830 --> 55:27.570]  I always wanted to take a big speaker and play a doorbell at the park.
[55:28.870 --> 55:29.770]  That's a good idea.
[55:32.590 --> 55:34.910]  I'll teach you all the houses that have doorbells.
[55:36.550 --> 55:38.030]  Oh, nice kill, Nick.
[55:38.610 --> 55:41.330]  Well, he did walk in front of me.
[55:42.150 --> 55:42.890]  Yeah, but that was great.
[55:43.570 --> 55:44.270]  Give yourself some credit.
[55:46.430 --> 55:46.950]  Alright, I got it.
[55:47.170 --> 55:47.550]  I'll be right back.
[55:53.800 --> 55:55.060]  Alright, covering Geoff.
[55:57.440 --> 55:59.760]  I thought Geoff had left, so when I was shot by him, I was...
[55:59.760 --> 56:00.060]  Hunter!
[56:00.060 --> 56:01.480]  Oh, shit!
[56:04.900 --> 56:05.500]  You alright?
[56:08.480 --> 56:09.780]  He's gonna heal straight away.
[56:11.220 --> 56:12.300]  You know what? Probably for the best.
[56:19.520 --> 56:20.060]  Okay, he's back.
[56:20.920 --> 56:21.980]  Oh, what the... Gavin!
[56:27.740 --> 56:29.880]  You're all good.
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.600]  Wait a minute, did I give you my pills?
[56:36.560 --> 56:38.560]  You might have shoved them down my throat, yeah.
[56:38.560 --> 56:38.960]  No!
[56:42.440 --> 56:46.900]  I had my light off and I couldn't see anything. My gun went down and then my fist was in my mouth.
[56:52.440 --> 56:52.900]  Gavin?
[56:53.600 --> 56:54.060]  Yeah?
[56:54.780 --> 56:55.340]  Shot me.
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.100]  Yeah?
[57:03.380 --> 57:04.380]  Okay, running out.
[57:06.640 --> 57:07.100]  Ward.
[57:07.940 --> 57:08.400]  Charger.
[57:08.640 --> 57:09.680]  Oh, shit!
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.960]  Man, you stepped right in front of the charger, Gavin.
[57:13.220 --> 57:14.400]  They're coming up over the bus.
[57:17.100 --> 57:17.480]  Ow!
[57:19.760 --> 57:20.140]  Spitter.
[57:21.720 --> 57:22.100]  Ow.
[57:24.620 --> 57:27.240]  If I move, I'll be shot. If I stay still, I'll be hit.
[57:27.400 --> 57:27.920]  God damn.
[57:29.300 --> 57:30.520]  These zombies are such assholes.
[57:34.600 --> 57:34.980]  Alright.
[57:39.820 --> 57:40.200]  Gavin?
[57:40.200 --> 57:40.480]  Gavin?
[57:41.180 --> 57:41.840]  How's it going?
[57:42.260 --> 57:42.660]  Thanks.
[57:48.580 --> 57:50.200]  Andrew killed a boomer.
[57:50.740 --> 57:51.800]  Yep, I shoot him.
[57:51.880 --> 57:54.200]  Did you hit him with some pronouns? Couldn't take it?
[57:58.880 --> 58:00.500]  Pushing up the RV.
[58:01.620 --> 58:02.740]  Visible tattoos spotted.
[58:10.680 --> 58:13.120]  I was really hoping there'd be some health in here.
[58:19.110 --> 58:21.250]  What do they got in there?
[58:34.210 --> 58:34.670]  Witch.
[58:37.670 --> 58:39.130]  Is she right in the way?
[58:39.470 --> 58:39.950]  Hunter! Hunter! Hunter!
[58:42.070 --> 58:42.750]  Oh, boy.
[58:46.830 --> 58:48.150]  See if you can take those pills.
[58:49.310 --> 58:50.530]  Uh, where are they?
[58:50.630 --> 58:52.150]  I think she's in that very room.
[58:55.510 --> 58:57.450]  Lights off? Is that a thing with the witch?
[58:58.010 --> 58:58.590]  I think so.
[59:04.900 --> 59:05.720]  Don't see her.
[59:06.320 --> 59:06.820]  Pipe bomb.
[59:08.320 --> 59:08.880]  Take that.
[59:09.160 --> 59:11.740]  I dropped a molotov if anybody wants it.
[59:16.560 --> 59:17.760]  I saved myself.
[59:18.120 --> 59:18.900]  I'm throwing a pipe bomb.
[59:20.240 --> 59:21.140]  Down, punk.
[59:21.440 --> 59:22.840]  Killing motherfuckers.
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.800]  I'm having to move.
[59:25.400 --> 59:25.780]  Uh-oh.
[59:25.880 --> 59:26.340]  Spit on Geoff.
[59:26.480 --> 59:27.500]  Spit her. Spit her.
[59:28.300 --> 59:29.040]  You bitch.
[59:29.460 --> 59:29.920]  I'm gonna get her.
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.400]  She's gonna kill Ash.
[59:31.460 --> 59:32.920]  Oh, the witch is walking towards me.
[59:34.120 --> 59:35.720]  Oh, she's a wandering witch.
[59:37.640 --> 59:38.980]  She's a wandering witch.
[59:40.940 --> 59:42.180]  They call her the wanderer.
[59:45.660 --> 59:46.840]  What was that?
[59:47.240 --> 59:48.640]  Gavin hits her with a catchphrase.
[59:48.640 --> 59:49.180]  Zombie.
[59:50.360 --> 59:51.840]  My spooky catchphrase.
[59:52.080 --> 59:52.260]  Yeah.
[59:53.000 --> 59:53.480]  Spooky.
[59:56.200 --> 59:57.140]  Alright, let's go, Gavin.
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:05.780]  Chainsaw.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.540]  Are there any health items up there?
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.780]  Incendiary ammo.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.040]  You're a sting on the old health.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.200]  Hunter.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.260]  Alright, we're doing pretty good.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.340]  Okay, well.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.040]  Oh.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.820]  Well, forward.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.680]  Into a corner.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.360]  See if that helps.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.340]  Should I put down flame ammo?
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:42.900]  Uh, sure.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.100]  Let's crossfire here, Gavin.
[01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.610]  Nice.
[01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.410]  Spit her. Spit her. Spit her.
[01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.450]  Fuck.
[01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:56.350]  Hey, nice job.
[01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:57.690]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:00.990]  I'm just pushing forward.
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:02.490]  That worked pretty well.
[01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.410]  Nice job, fellas.
[01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.410]  Ammo up here.
[01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.090]  Gavin, what happened?
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.050]  One zombie.
[01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.290]  Ow.
[01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:14.590]  One zombie got me, too.
[01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:15.190]  Oh, fuck.
[01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:16.270]  One zombie got me.
[01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.330]  Oh, wait. What?
[01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:18.950]  Andrew?
[01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:21.890]  I was just about to get in the...
[01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:22.610]  I'm dead, dude.
[01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.330]  I was just about to get in the thing with Andrew.
[01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.490]  I have a defib, so I can get someone.
[01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:30.130]  Who should I get?
[01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:31.330]  Gavin.
[01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:32.450]  Whoever's closest to you.
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:32.850]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.850]  Well, you're on the way.
[01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:35.970]  Yeah, good, Geoff.
[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:37.470]  To the exit.
[01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.210]  But I could go back for Gavin.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:44.520]  Oh, spit.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.500]  There's a spitter right here.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:45.940]  Well...
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:46.320]  Holy shit.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.400]  I regret everything about this decision.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:48.960]  Goodbye, Geoff.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:50.600]  I'm back.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.040]  That's unfortunate.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.000]  And I'm, uh, dying.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:53.700]  That's...
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.400]  That was so unlucky.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.160]  Hey, did you know I revived you to feel pain?
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.160]  I'm alive!
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.480]  It hurts!
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.660]  Why was I programmed to feel pain?
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.580]  Oh, spit, spit, spit!
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.640]  Oh, go, go, go, go!
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.280]  Holy hell.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:13.300]  Holy God!
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.600]  He jumped down the manhole and got tongued to death.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.020]  Wait.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.320]  He died.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.540]  I think he either died from the tongue or the fall.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.620]  I was at 16% yet.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.140]  I got tongued as I was falling.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.300]  And, uh, died.
[01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.160]  Alright.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.060]  Gotta tuck and roll.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.520]  Alright, Nick.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.180]  We got this.
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:32.900]  Oh.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.780]  He's gonna thin it out a little bit.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.100]  What?
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.160]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:39.600]  What?
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.020]  What?
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:40.960]  Oh, behind!
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.040]  The smoker!
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.260]  The smoker behind!
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:44.320]  Oh, no!
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.220]  It came for us!
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:45.380]  Save me!
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.080]  Save me!
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.240]  I'm trying to hold on!
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.060]  I killed the other one!
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.360]  It's a deer!
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:48.940]  It's his cousin!
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.100]  It's a killer whale!
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.860]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.740]  Damn.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.240]  So close.
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.660]  Okay.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.520]  Ammo.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:04.080]  Heal.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.480]  Barely.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.620]  What's a good gun?
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.000]  I'm gonna use the hunting rifle.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.540]  I like the AK.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.900]  Desert rifle over here.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.420]  Yeah, the desert rifle over here is great.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:17.200]  Okay.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:18.780]  Three round first.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:19.980]  There's a lot of zombies.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.680]  I'm gonna take the extra.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.140]  It's accurate and it is three round first.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:25.480]  Here, Geoff.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.900]  You can take my pills.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:27.800]  Oh.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:28.840]  Well, thank you.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.040]  Well.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.000]  Okay.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.140]  He handed them to me while I was firing at a zombie.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:33.780]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.260]  He was in the middle of trying to kill a zombie and then he ate some pills.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.940]  And got hit by the zombie.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:44.400]  What the fuck?
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.140]  What was that?
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.780]  I definitely just shot you thinking you were a zombie.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.600]  I'm so sorry.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.200]  I shot you as a reflex.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.760]  You shot me back.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.160]  Yeah, that's fair.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.400]  Yeah, this run is over.
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:53.740]  That's fair.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.080]  I just thought I was getting killed by a zombie.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:00.780]  Cord.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.020]  Charger.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:04.800]  Charger.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.620]  There's a fucking jockey too.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.820]  I think I got him.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.360]  He got me.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.500]  Nope.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.640]  I don't even know where to look.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.600]  Geoff.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.620]  Good sights.
[01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:27.110]  Boomer.
[01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:33.650]  I shot Geoff.
[01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.350]  There it is.
[01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.730]  Good job.
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.690]  I noticed I was on the ground again.
[01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.470]  I noticed that too.
[01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.610]  Geoff and I have just killed each other.
[01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.210]  Why don't we...
[01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:51.010]  Maybe we should just start this run again.
[01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.930]  It feels like it's already over.
[01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:55.430]  This one.
[01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.430]  Nah.
[01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:57.250]  This one's fine.
[01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:58.190]  Found the...
[01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:00.450]  I like Geoff as well.
[01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.890]  Found the...
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.290]  I found the tank.
[01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:02.710]  Oh, you found...
[01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:03.670]  Dude, oh, you found him.
[01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.310]  Tank's inside upstairs.
[01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:06.750]  Oh, boy.
[01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.350]  Hey, good eye, bud.
[01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:07.910]  Oh, boy.
[01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:08.390]  Oh, boy.
[01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:09.290]  That's a dead end.
[01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:10.710]  Oh, that sure is a dead end.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:20.220]  Well...
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:20.800]  Oof.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:21.460]  That hurt.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.980]  That hurt a bunch.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.400]  One stupid zombie.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.000]  Oh, that's a climb to stop sign.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.500]  Oh, he died on top of the stop sign.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.440]  You're gonna get towed sign.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.400]  Alright, well, I feel...
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.720]  Less confident.
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.120]  I feel good.
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.360]  We'll get Geoff coming up in a minute.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.600]  It's covered in it.
[01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.070]  Burning goo shit.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.560]  It's Geoff.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.460]  Hey.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:09.520]  Hello.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.720]  Andrew, I fell.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.860]  Yeah, that's okay.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.300]  One drop down, be careful.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.040]  He's chasing you.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.340]  Oh, Christ!
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.420]  There's lots chasing me.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.420]  Oh, wow.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.620]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.040]  Oh, boys.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.600]  Oh, boys.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.580]  Oh, that was Andrew I shot.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.840]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.200]  Hey, what's happening with this charger?
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:31.840]  Nobody said anything.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.700]  Let's punch him into the ground real hard.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.260]  I mean, just nobody calling anything out.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.300]  I think everyone's just ready for the reset.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.540]  Jockey.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.180]  Ah!
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:45.820]  Oops.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:46.720]  Well.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.840]  Hey, let's not shoot at each other.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.020]  We don't shoot at each other.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.380]  I will not give you pills when you're trying to kill zombies, Geoff.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.440]  I appreciate that.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.180]  So we don't set ourselves up for failure.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:04.560]  Yep.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.640]  You know, when you put it that way, it makes sense.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.380]  Gavin, do you want to try the AK and I'll take the Desert Rifle?
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.720]  Is that better? Yeah.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.500]  It's a full auto. Do you prefer that?
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.940]  Well, let's see. Let's find out.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:21.320]  All right.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:22.720]  Pills on me.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.720]  Behind you, behind you, behind you, Gavin, behind you.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.220]  That's on me, that's on me.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.240]  That's on me.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.640]  What if we had one round where nobody said, that's on me?
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.760]  That would be pretty cool.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.660]  Go back to the safe room. Just go back to the safe room.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.420]  Well, goodbye.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.840]  And we don't need to go back to the safe room now because they're all going to hit Nick.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.400]  Okay, well, you already sent me back to the safe room, goddammit, now I'm down.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.120]  That's a white cat.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.220]  Yeah, that's white. That's good.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.100]  Hey.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.020]  You don't when you see him.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.300]  That's white.
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:16.510]  Jesus Christ.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.840]  I'm already...
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.800]  Fire and flames.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.220]  We carry on.
[01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.050]  Oh, god.
[01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:46.110]  Ah, you guys suck, I don't know.
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.370]  Gavin, how did you like that?
[01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:55.650]  You're not in a good position to start and it's incredibly hard.
[01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.710]  This sucks. This is what happens when you put it on expert.
[01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:01.550]  Gavin, what do you think of the AK, you like it?
[01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.830]  I'm taking the other one.
[01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.510]  Geoff, I'm giving you pills.
[01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:05.910]  Oh my god, thank you.
[01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.050]  Okay, and we're going to speed run.
[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:08.370]  Yep.
[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.770]  Ready?
[01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:09.350]  Ready.
[01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.010]  We're just going to run. Let's go.
[01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.570]  Okay, go.
[01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:12.150]  Speed.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:22.840]  Just keep running.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.520]  Look back every once in a while, punch them, because they'll try to catch you.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.540]  That's cool.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.740]  Look back every once in a while to say goodbye to your friends you left along the way.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.020]  Just try to cement that image into your memory so you'll have something to remember them by.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:45.820]  Oh!
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.100]  Go on without me.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.840]  Oh, charger!
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:07.180]  Oh my god, I found the charger.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.760]  He found me.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.020]  Alright, it's all you, Andrew.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.220]  Speed running.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.940]  Oh, it's just like punching me into oblivion.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.620]  It's kind of nice because you're keeping his hands full.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.160]  They're definitely full.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.060]  Nick is just firing his gun at the head of one dead zombie.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:37.860]  He's just pulling the trigger.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:43.700]  It's the most impotent rage you've ever seen.
[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.160]  Alright, let's not say impotent.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:45.960]  It's so funny.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.820]  Alright, Andrew, you got this.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.660]  Don't set the car alarms off.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.700]  You made a good physics engine.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.240]  Oh, man.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.600]  Yeah, what if they never made another one of these games?
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:10:59.520]  I know!
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:00.160]  That's ridiculous.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:00.820]  Yeah.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.900]  And two came out like three after one.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:04.400]  Fuck!
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:05.740]  Oh, that's too bad.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.460]  That would have done it.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.300]  You got far.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:11.600]  Yeah.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:13.260]  Speed.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.020]  Oh, you got really far.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.320]  That's what happens when he's not held back by dead weight.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.040]  Speed.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.820]  Okay, we got it.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.780]  We know what to do this time.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:21.640]  Let's go.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.740]  Every man for himself.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.460]  I mean, full run.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.020]  Full speed.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:31.720]  Give you the pills, Geoff.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.840]  Alright, once everyone's healed up, call it out and we'll go.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.560]  I'm ready.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.300]  Everyone ready?
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.120]  Ready.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.480]  Open the door.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.020]  Go.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.380]  There should be an achievement for, like, dodging zombies in this game.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.160]  Yeah.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.320]  Like, run most amount of distance without...
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.200]  Having to...
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:11:59.660]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.200]  Oh, Andrew would be the MVP of that.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.280]  Dodged it.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:06.760]  Oh, thank you.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.000]  Nice shot.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.640]  Okay, Horde. Chalky.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.640]  Nice shot.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.860]  Ah, shit, I got boomed. I'm screwed.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.480]  Just keep running.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.200]  Keep running.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.260]  Hope for the best. Expect the worst.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.340]  Why am I on fire?
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:29.880]  Oh, dear.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.200]  This is where the tank spawned last time.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.960]  No tank, which is concerning.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.440]  Nick almost made it in the house. Alright, he's in.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:40.980]  Almost.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.060]  You're locked in, Nick. You got it.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.680]  This builder's great framing. Come on, man.
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.080]  God damn it!
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:49.680]  I did it again.
[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:57.030]  Is there a ladder or do you just fall and get hurt no matter what?
[01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.510]  Just drop down.
[01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:58.070]  Go.
[01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.910]  He's right behind you, Andrew. Just keep going.
[01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:01.250]  Yep.
[01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:04.830]  Oh, this is bad.
[01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.430]  Ow.
[01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:08.950]  Keep going, man. Keep going.
[01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:10.870]  God damn it.
[01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:14.110]  There's like a hundred fucking zombies down here.
[01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.050]  We're about to get a tank.
[01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:26.370]  Hey, Geoff, if you got any throwables when you come to the sewers, I'd recommend...
[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:27.050]  You know I don't.
[01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:28.530]  There's the freeway.
[01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:29.690]  Alright, well, Geoff, I'd recommend...
[01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:31.070]  Dying?
[01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:33.530]  I'm just going to complete the map, man.
[01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.590]  Oh my god, you're alive. And I'm alive.
[01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:37.470]  Oh, not for long, though.
[01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:38.590]  Oh my god.
[01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:40.550]  Geoff, you saved me.
[01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.850]  Of course I did, dude.
[01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.230]  Straight ahead.
[01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.170]  Straight ahead, Nick.
[01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:47.570]  Up the ladder.
[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.850]  Come on, Geoff.
[01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:49.850]  Big moves.
[01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.490]  Alright, full...
[01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:54.510]  Heart.
[01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:56.530]  So, no red cards, right?
[01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:57.170]  Clear balls.
[01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.190]  No touchy.
[01:13:58.410 --> 01:13:59.350]  Clear balls.
[01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.830]  Geoff alerted the horde.
[01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:02.770]  I bumped into a red card.
[01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:03.630]  I bumped into a red card.
[01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:06.510]  I didn't shoot my gun at all.
[01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:07.370]  I didn't know that touching...
[01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:08.370]  Right, but...
[01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.570]  Right, doesn't matter.
[01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.070]  Just climb up. Just climb up. Just climb up.
[01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:18.370]  Are we supposed to defend here? What's up?
[01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:21.030]  Yeah, I'm just going to shoot the ladder as they climb up.
[01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:24.970]  I would not recommend the grenade launcher because it does friendly fire.
[01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:28.550]  Don't forget there's a health pack over here.
[01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:30.050]  Yep, there's multiple health packs.
[01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:33.010]  Still shot me, Geoff.
[01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.410]  Alright, just a little bit.
[01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:35.450]  Nick, you need to heal.
[01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.830]  Charger!
[01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.330]  Oh no, Charger. He's going to get me.
[01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.770]  He got him.
[01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:41.350]  Oh, okay.
[01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:42.350]  Nick, you need to heal.
[01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:43.510]  Okay, Horde is dead.
[01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.110]  There's a health pack right here, Nick.
[01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:47.310]  Okay, I didn't see it.
[01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.990]  In the ambulance.
[01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.990]  Did not see it.
[01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:51.950]  Well, I was...
[01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.270]  Okay, we're probably going to have a tank up here.
[01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:57.250]  I think I hear a hunter.
[01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.870]  Alright, time to move.
[01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.310]  Your strategy has been good so far.
[01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:05.190]  Oh, there's Gavin.
[01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:07.350]  Oh, balls.
[01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:11.470]  Good funnel spot.
[01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:12.330]  Yep.
[01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:12.990]  Yeah, it is.
[01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:16.510]  Yeah, if we're going to get boomed, this is the place.
[01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:18.290]  Geoff, don't take a step to your right, please.
[01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:19.270]  Geoff, don't walk in front of Nick.
[01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:20.230]  I won't.
[01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:20.290]  I won't.
[01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:21.290]  I'll stay left.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:27.480]  Jockey.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.260]  Jockey, coming up.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.480]  Yep.
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.360]  Wow, that was really cute.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:32.940]  Alright, got him.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:33.300]  Alright.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.520]  Going down.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:35.740]  Get Gavin.
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:36.880]  You got him, Nick?
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.420]  We're going to get him.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.060]  I got him.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.060]  Oh!
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.660]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.600]  Did you see what I saw?
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.800]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.320]  Ah!
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.040]  Geoff.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400]  How did that happen?
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.100]  Who did that?
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:50.680]  Did Geoff?
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.080]  Geoff.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.080]  What'd I do?
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:52.920]  Shot the propane tank.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.340]  Somebody shot a propane tank.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:55.200]  Where?
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.060]  I didn't...
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.880]  In the shed.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.060]  In the shed.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:57.400]  Smoke.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:57.860]  Smoke.
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:58.140]  Smoke.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.160]  Smoke.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:00.980]  I got you.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.040]  This is bad.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.580]  This is real bad.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:04.980]  It's okay.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.140]  It's okay.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:05.600]  I got you.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.160]  Ow!
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:06.740]  I don't got you.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.680]  Andrew, just keep moving.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.080]  Do your thing.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:08.920]  Yep.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:09.460]  Yeah, Andrew.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.120]  I'm going with you.
[01:16:17.770 --> 01:16:20.230]  Do you remember what direction it is?
[01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:20.550]  Yep.
[01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:22.350]  Let's get your ass up.
[01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:23.510]  Alright, I got you, Geoff.
[01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:24.090]  Thanks.
[01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:24.450]  Oh, yep.
[01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:27.770]  Let's get out of here.
[01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:31.830]  We're right here.
[01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:32.610]  What?
[01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:33.090]  Reloading.
[01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:33.490]  Oh.
[01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:37.850]  No!
[01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:38.870]  Shut up.
[01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:39.650]  Oh!
[01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.350]  It's why you don't gasp like you did it.
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:46.670]  The gasp was for the tank.
[01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:49.030]  Bullshit!
[01:16:49.810 --> 01:16:50.970]  Also, Nick, you're a genius.
[01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:53.590]  Nick, you're a genius.
[01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:54.550]  Thank you.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.780]  Listen, at least one of us will make it.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:01.080]  Yep.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.340]  It's not me.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:04.780]  I'm in here with the tank.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.760]  He is...
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.620]  very alive.
[01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.450]  Do you think I'm actually hurting him, or...
[01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:18.950]  I can't tell.
[01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:21.890]  There's blood that's flying onto your screen, so you must be.
[01:17:22.450 --> 01:17:22.710]  You absolutely are.
[01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:23.450]  I got you, Gavin.
[01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:24.950]  Come on, come on.
[01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.510]  Oh my god, you came back?
[01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.850]  Yeah.
[01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:28.590]  Holy shit.
[01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:30.290]  You got him.
[01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:31.210]  It's safer, so it's fine.
[01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:32.410]  Go walk out there and say...
[01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:33.790]  Everybody made it but me.
[01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:34.250]  Good job.
[01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:35.730]  Holy shit.
[01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.970]  Come on, fellas.
[01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:38.150]  Open it up.
[01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:38.630]  Let him in.
[01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:42.150]  Gavin!
[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:43.710]  I'm hurt.
[01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:45.590]  It was a little...
[01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:47.330]  Yeah!
[01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:50.130]  What was that noise?
[01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:51.450]  Yeah!
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.840]  That was me being happy, Geoff.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.600]  Okay, I was hurting him.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.560]  Yeah, you did great.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.200]  Nice, Nick.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.960]  Well, I was behind an iron door firing into it.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.040]  I wish I had been.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.680]  I wish I had been smart enough to do that.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:13.160]  I ran up to the door and I was like,
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:13.640]  Hey, I'm right...
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.160]  Oh, there's a tank between me and the door.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.280]  Do we want to wrap up here?
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.400]  Do we want to try to give this...
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:19.560]  Yeah, we could.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.000]  Is it saved?
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.360]  Like, can we just continue a different time?
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.140]  I don't think we can save, but I can start it from this chapter.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.520]  Might as well just do that.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:27.820]  Yeah, might as well do that.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:28.120]  Yeah.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.100]  This just went so long.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:30.940]  Yeah, it did.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.900]  We got through it.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:44.000]  Thanks for watching part one of the second video of Left 4 Dead 2 in the second campaign part of what we're doing.
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.100]  Did you like it?
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.980]  This is expert and it's very hard.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:51.160]  If you saw some gameplay that you really enjoyed, let a friend know.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:56.140]  Let them know that those guys from Achievement Hunter a long time ago are still playing Left 4 Dead 2.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.560]  And it's better...
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.580]  They won't fucking stop.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:01.760]  It's better than ever because they won't make a new fucking Left 4 Dead.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.460]  It's great.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:03.900]  We love doing it.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:04.800]  We love doing it for you.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:09.140]  And we hope you'll check out Regulatrion.com and the podcast, Regulation Podcast.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:14.380]  And that'll do it for me, the guy watching these guys do their best.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.160]  Ow!
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.440]  Alright, we'll see you guys later. Bye!
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:20.540]  Bye!
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:21.340]  Bye now.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:22.100]  Bye.
