[00:00.000 --> 00:04.960]  I don't know who the leader is, because it dropped me, so someone else, I think, is going to have to hit play.
[00:05.080 --> 00:05.880]  I think it might be Gavin.
[00:06.300 --> 00:08.200]  It is Gavin, yeah, he's got the house on the screen.
[00:08.860 --> 00:11.820]  Does it still show us two of the same character in here?
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.800]  Uh, no, I see Dogbrain...
[00:13.800 --> 00:15.360]  Oh, Dogbrain and Schwartzy are the same, yeah.
[00:15.580 --> 00:17.040]  Yeah, yeah, I don't know how to change that.
[00:18.180 --> 00:19.700]  It's just a cosmetic thing, it doesn't matter.
[00:20.380 --> 00:20.520]  Okay.
[00:20.940 --> 00:22.060]  Anderson, it doesn't matter, let's do it.
[00:22.340 --> 00:22.940]  Doesn't matter.
[00:23.480 --> 00:24.180]  How does it... okay.
[00:25.060 --> 00:26.560]  Anderson, it doesn't matter!
[00:27.240 --> 00:28.680]  That's not their playable character!
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.920]  That's their, like, gamer pick within the game.
[00:32.220 --> 00:33.220]  That doesn't represent who they are.
[00:33.220 --> 00:34.740]  Just so you know, that is my playable character.
[00:34.840 --> 00:37.200]  I also believe that that is my playable character.
[00:37.420 --> 00:40.000]  Okay, well, you guys just coincidentally have that.
[00:40.360 --> 00:41.540]  It's also my playable character.
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.620]  You have a different symbol, you can't say that.
[00:45.880 --> 00:48.960]  You just said the symbol isn't the same as the playable character.
[00:49.340 --> 00:50.640]  I did, but...
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.760]  Why don't the rules apply to me?
[00:53.160 --> 00:53.700]  Oh, there we go.
[00:54.340 --> 00:55.460]  Not the same characters.
[00:55.880 --> 00:57.960]  Nick is the character, though, that he portrays.
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.240]  I'm gonna be... I'm gonna be Sunglasses Gator.
[01:01.500 --> 01:03.800]  I'll be Sunglasses Gator, and then everyone else can be whatever.
[01:03.960 --> 01:04.660]  I'm Lady Duck.
[01:05.280 --> 01:07.020]  Ooh, Lady Duck is cool.
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.080]  Lady Duck rules.
[01:08.400 --> 01:10.260]  I bought that at 3 AM last night.
[01:10.480 --> 01:10.900]  Okay.
[01:12.080 --> 01:12.740]  You did?
[01:12.920 --> 01:14.420]  While you guys were TikToking.
[01:14.900 --> 01:15.960]  Yeah, you were...
[01:15.960 --> 01:17.380]  I was burning the midnight oil.
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.100]  I mean, Geoff has been practicing so he doesn't fucking lose on his first stream.
[01:20.220 --> 01:21.960]  Uh, I don't remember how to...
[01:23.000 --> 01:23.880]  So, Geoff...
[01:23.880 --> 01:24.580]  Don't worry.
[01:25.020 --> 01:26.400]  Geoff knows how to play.
[01:27.860 --> 01:31.200]  We should get Geoff out of here because he knows how to play.
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.140]  I remember now.
[01:32.480 --> 01:35.300]  Just because I played all night doesn't mean I know how to play.
[01:35.500 --> 01:35.840]  Let's get him.
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.160]  There's still the whole, I'm not good at shit, to contend with.
[01:40.580 --> 01:41.240]  Oh, oh no!
[01:41.880 --> 01:42.500]  No, Nick!
[01:42.740 --> 01:43.120]  Oh, God!
[01:43.500 --> 01:43.940]  Climb!
[01:44.120 --> 01:44.660]  Oh my God!
[01:44.980 --> 01:45.000]  Climb!
[01:45.440 --> 01:45.760]  Please!
[01:46.500 --> 01:46.940]  Nick!
[01:47.120 --> 01:47.280]  What?
[01:48.540 --> 01:49.660]  Alright, I forgot how to climb.
[01:49.660 --> 01:53.480]  I'm Geoff jumping up from the side!
[01:54.700 --> 01:55.660]  How do you pick stuff up?
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.080]  Oh, Mr. Not Good at the Game is just climbing and grabbing items and...
[02:00.080 --> 02:02.240]  Die, die, die, die, die, die.
[02:02.260 --> 02:03.380]  Anyone know how to pick stuff up?
[02:04.840 --> 02:07.500]  Right trigger and X. Right trigger and X. Right trigger and, I'm sorry.
[02:08.060 --> 02:10.620]  Right trigger is to pick it up, then X is to swing.
[02:10.860 --> 02:13.220]  Hey chat, what should I hit them with?
[02:14.420 --> 02:14.700]  Ow!
[02:15.320 --> 02:15.700]  Ow!
[02:16.500 --> 02:20.020]  Also is the... let us know if the volume's okay on the game. I can turn it up or down.
[02:21.300 --> 02:22.640]  Am I just... oh. Okay.
[02:23.380 --> 02:24.220]  I want the big mallet.
[02:25.900 --> 02:27.020]  I just threw it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:28.640]  Oh, fuck!
[02:29.160 --> 02:29.540]  Hi, Geoff.
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.620]  No, no. I'm not dead. Geoff's good.
[02:33.980 --> 02:35.980]  Hang on, Gator! His sunglasses are gone!
[02:37.040 --> 02:37.420]  Ha.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.200]  Ducked it. Ducked it.
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.160]  I've been headbutted by a duck. Oh, no.
[02:46.080 --> 02:48.060]  I bet you a duck would give a good headbutt.
[02:48.100 --> 02:48.280]  Yeah!
[02:49.320 --> 02:50.200]  Of the animals?
[02:51.240 --> 02:53.100]  Oh, I don't know if I'm...
[02:53.100 --> 02:56.800]  What do you think the worst thing to get headbutted by would be?
[02:56.880 --> 02:57.900]  I would say Klingon.
[02:58.560 --> 02:59.420]  I would think Rhino.
[03:00.220 --> 03:00.860]  Rhino would be bad.
[03:01.320 --> 03:01.640]  Unicorn.
[03:02.120 --> 03:02.300]  Yeah.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.120]  Are there rhinos in the Star Trek universe, though?
[03:05.180 --> 03:06.860]  I thought it was accepted that that's what we were doing.
[03:07.000 --> 03:07.980]  Uh-oh. We got Creep.
[03:09.600 --> 03:10.160]  Oh, shit.
[03:10.720 --> 03:12.480]  The longest pot animals fight I've ever seen.
[03:12.520 --> 03:12.840]  Yeah, really.
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.620]  It does not end.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.740]  I died by killing myself, and that's it.
[03:17.600 --> 03:19.480]  Oh, there's a time limit? Oh, my God.
[03:19.980 --> 03:20.460]  Oh!
[03:21.580 --> 03:23.340]  Oh, Geoff!
[03:23.500 --> 03:24.920]  I mean, just one good slap.
[03:25.940 --> 03:27.440]  Oh, my God!
[03:29.120 --> 03:31.400]  Dude, just one good slap. Holy shit.
[03:31.400 --> 03:34.420]  You're like Shohei Otani'd me. Holy shit.
[03:34.840 --> 03:35.700]  Oh, my God.
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.020]  Get out of here. Get out of here.
[03:38.660 --> 03:40.320]  Ow. Ow. No! No, no, no, no!
[03:40.320 --> 03:41.060]  Oh, my God!
[03:42.480 --> 03:43.820]  Oh, no, Geoff, you idiot!
[03:44.680 --> 03:46.840]  Oh, Gavin and Moneybags are holding hands.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.380]  Oh, Gavin's already dead.
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.760]  I still remember how to climb.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.540]  What are the climb buttons?
[03:53.260 --> 03:53.600]  No!
[03:53.820 --> 03:54.900]  The triggers, I think.
[03:55.180 --> 03:56.300]  No, no, it's Y.
[03:56.620 --> 03:58.280]  Don't pull the Y trigger and Y.
[04:02.600 --> 04:03.040]  Please.
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.860]  Well, I'm dog shit.
[04:05.360 --> 04:05.940]  I'm a dog shit.
[04:05.940 --> 04:07.580]  Oh, the boomerang!
[04:07.600 --> 04:09.160]  I got hit by my own boomerang!
[04:09.280 --> 04:09.720]  No!
[04:11.060 --> 04:11.800]  Oh, no!
[04:12.160 --> 04:12.520]  Go away!
[04:13.900 --> 04:14.260]  Climb!
[04:14.360 --> 04:15.040]  Climb! No, climb!
[04:15.560 --> 04:15.920]  Climb!
[04:16.820 --> 04:17.480]  Alright, well...
[04:17.480 --> 04:18.640]  I got hit by my own boomerang.
[04:18.700 --> 04:21.460]  I didn't know. I threw it, and then, dude, it came right back.
[04:21.520 --> 04:22.260]  What the fuck?
[04:23.700 --> 04:24.640]  Isn't that what they do?
[04:24.720 --> 04:24.960]  Isn't that what they do, Boomer?
[04:26.020 --> 04:26.740]  Isn't that...
[04:26.740 --> 04:28.620]  Who knew that they did that shit?
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.520]  That's fucking crazy.
[04:30.060 --> 04:30.860]  I'll bet all things do.
[04:32.220 --> 04:37.280]  I mean, you're a known non-Frisbee guy, so I guess it makes sense that you wouldn't even think about fucking with Boomer.
[04:38.060 --> 04:38.760]  Oh, shit!
[04:40.000 --> 04:41.040]  Oh, my God!
[04:41.040 --> 04:41.400]  Eric!
[04:41.400 --> 04:41.920]  Get up!
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.060]  No!
[04:43.620 --> 04:44.600]  Eric, drop the bat!
[04:45.120 --> 04:46.980]  Oh, Lady Duck is down!
[04:47.440 --> 04:48.280]  You gotta go, bud!
[04:49.660 --> 04:51.060]  Oh, Gavin is...
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.680]  At least I died like a lady.
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.420]  I think Gavin is probably as accurate in real life with crossbow as he is...
[04:58.420 --> 04:59.880]  He's not looking at me.
[04:59.940 --> 05:00.500]  He's a one-to-one.
[05:00.600 --> 05:03.420]  House of Homie said, give him the old razzle-dazzle.
[05:06.680 --> 05:07.140]  No!
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.420]  I'm just trying to crossbow over here.
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.440]  Oh, he's razzle-dazzling?
[05:13.420 --> 05:13.880]  Gavin!
[05:14.560 --> 05:15.560]  Get off my ass!
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.120]  Get off my goose ass!
[05:18.420 --> 05:20.060]  There's a stun gun in the top right.
[05:21.180 --> 05:22.420]  Gator's going for it!
[05:22.600 --> 05:23.580]  Someone threw a bomb!
[05:24.580 --> 05:25.660]  Screw it away!
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.020]  I picked it up!
[05:28.080 --> 05:30.600]  How come I pick it up, and then I just...
[05:30.600 --> 05:32.340]  Sometimes I throw it, and sometimes I swing with it.
[05:32.440 --> 05:32.720]  I don't know.
[05:33.760 --> 05:34.220]  Oh!
[05:35.760 --> 05:37.260]  Oh, the tables have turned!
[05:38.660 --> 05:39.780]  What is that?
[05:39.780 --> 05:41.900]  You were holding me!
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.740]  The gas circle is coming in!
[05:44.840 --> 05:45.280]  Got him!
[05:46.860 --> 05:49.660]  Oh, the stun, he can't get up, and the gas is moving in!
[05:49.780 --> 05:51.060]  Oh, you fog-haired!
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.440]  Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
[05:58.920 --> 06:00.880]  Oh, they're both getting tugged!
[06:01.160 --> 06:01.440]  Oh, no!
[06:02.520 --> 06:03.260]  Eric, I can't breathe!
[06:06.240 --> 06:07.580]  Throw your bombs!
[06:08.280 --> 06:09.040]  Help me!
[06:09.300 --> 06:09.820]  Yes!
[06:10.700 --> 06:12.280]  Eric has to go!
[06:13.820 --> 06:15.120]  And Eric reverses!
[06:15.220 --> 06:15.780]  Eric, let me go!
[06:17.280 --> 06:18.020]  They do!
[06:18.280 --> 06:19.460]  They both don't do anything!
[06:20.420 --> 06:22.680]  They go back to back and swing at Eric!
[06:23.800 --> 06:25.980]  Eric just walked off the side!
[06:26.160 --> 06:27.400]  Get up! Hold Y!
[06:27.540 --> 06:29.040]  Right trigger, Y! Hold Y!
[06:30.880 --> 06:31.920]  Get up!
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.580]  You're not dead yet!
[06:33.860 --> 06:34.180]  No!
[06:34.180 --> 06:34.660]  Yes!
[06:36.240 --> 06:38.220]  Oh, my God!
[06:38.580 --> 06:39.480]  Holy shit!
[06:40.140 --> 06:41.820]  What an amazing thing!
[06:42.280 --> 06:43.860]  I died with a dick in my plunger!
[06:44.420 --> 06:46.100]  My dick in a plunger?
[06:46.900 --> 06:48.260]  Hey, are you okay?
[06:48.760 --> 06:49.000]  Yeah!
[06:50.020 --> 06:50.240]  Yeah!
[06:52.200 --> 06:56.120]  Hey, Eric's got the boomerang!
[06:57.160 --> 06:57.740]  Oh, shit!
[06:58.240 --> 06:59.000]  Holy shit!
[06:59.160 --> 07:00.420]  Get with the block!
[07:00.420 --> 07:00.460]  Fuck!
[07:02.960 --> 07:03.480]  Shit!
[07:04.600 --> 07:06.200]  Kevin just attacked himself!
[07:06.300 --> 07:06.800]  That was it!
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.160]  That boomerang is dangerous for mainly the person who throws it.
[07:10.480 --> 07:11.300]  That's a real dangerous one.
[07:13.040 --> 07:13.980]  Hey, boom!
[07:14.560 --> 07:15.220]  Let me up!
[07:15.460 --> 07:17.760]  Oh, who's gonna get the nunchucks?
[07:18.060 --> 07:19.080]  You little fucking alligator!
[07:19.100 --> 07:20.580]  Oh, you little alligator bitch!
[07:20.680 --> 07:22.380]  Get him, Nick!
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.300]  Okay, well...
[07:26.300 --> 07:27.060]  There they go.
[07:27.060 --> 07:27.760]  Well...
[07:29.180 --> 07:30.780]  You son of a bitch, Nick!
[07:30.920 --> 07:31.620]  Hey, remember me!
[07:31.740 --> 07:34.740]  I'm trying to get none!
[07:36.040 --> 07:37.760]  Oh, they both got the block instead!
[07:38.400 --> 07:38.840]  It's a block off!
[07:38.840 --> 07:40.640]  We got about 2,000 people watching us.
[07:40.900 --> 07:43.320]  We should be cool if we got up to 500,000.
[07:44.420 --> 07:45.180]  That's what we should do.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.280]  That's what I think.
[07:48.380 --> 07:51.400]  We started at 2,000. Let's shoot for 500,000.
[07:51.480 --> 07:51.840]  Hell yeah!
[07:53.680 --> 07:55.320]  Maybe like 3,000, Geoff.
[07:55.320 --> 07:56.160]  What about that?
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.660]  Maybe people just go subscribe to the Patreon.
[07:59.260 --> 08:00.060]  That would be cool too.
[08:00.220 --> 08:02.260]  You can't get to 500,000 without passing 3,000.
[08:02.460 --> 08:04.080]  You know...
[08:04.080 --> 08:06.080]  A little bit of a gap between those two.
[08:06.500 --> 08:08.900]  We only have 480,000 to go.
[08:09.080 --> 08:10.420]  Long live the king!
[08:12.080 --> 08:12.800]  Yeah, go!
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.060]  Oh, god damn it!
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.020]  Drop the crossbows!
[08:17.180 --> 08:19.980]  Gavin is one win away from taking this.
[08:20.140 --> 08:21.020]  Alright, we can't let him do it.
[08:21.040 --> 08:21.600]  We gotta kill Gavin!
[08:22.920 --> 08:24.220]  He's got the stun gun!
[08:24.340 --> 08:25.140]  Don't let him stun us!
[08:25.500 --> 08:26.820]  I'm gonna double headshot!
[08:27.040 --> 08:27.220]  Let's go!
[08:28.560 --> 08:29.020]  Yeah!
[08:30.260 --> 08:33.500]  Oh, will Eric take it?
[08:33.540 --> 08:35.220]  Because they just all targeted Gavin.
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.380]  No, Geoff is up.
[08:38.000 --> 08:38.920]  Come on!
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.100]  Why?
[08:41.780 --> 08:43.140]  Grab the wall, Hal!
[08:43.220 --> 08:43.720]  Grab wall!
[08:44.840 --> 08:46.460]  Oh my god, Eric was invisible!
[08:46.920 --> 08:48.980]  Oh, I didn't know that!
[08:48.980 --> 08:50.120]  I was invisible?
[08:50.760 --> 08:51.740]  Yeah, did you drink a potion?
[08:52.440 --> 08:53.680]  Yeah, but I didn't know I was invisible.
[08:54.620 --> 08:57.300]  That's the shovel that Geoff used to dig his bean hole.
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.620]  That's how I knew it so well.
[09:01.780 --> 09:02.180]  No!
[09:02.940 --> 09:03.340]  My weapon!
[09:04.360 --> 09:05.160]  Oh, shit!
[09:05.400 --> 09:06.080]  Gavin's invisible!
[09:07.860 --> 09:08.800]  He's going for the bat!
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.500]  He's got a bat!
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.260]  Oh my god!
[09:15.260 --> 09:19.280]  You son of a bitch!
[09:20.920 --> 09:21.200]  No!
[09:23.780 --> 09:24.960]  You bastard!
[09:27.220 --> 09:29.320]  You come here, you motherfucker!
[09:29.720 --> 09:30.380]  Get the duck!
[09:30.760 --> 09:31.620]  Oh my god!
[09:32.820 --> 09:34.440]  Give me the duck!
[09:34.520 --> 09:35.360]  Gavin, you gotta go!
[09:36.600 --> 09:38.260]  Where is that bitch?
[09:38.440 --> 09:39.720]  Why am I all fucked up?
[09:39.720 --> 09:40.280]  You're in a plunge.
[09:43.240 --> 09:44.880]  You're in like a three point stance.
[09:44.880 --> 09:45.860]  Not me, him!
[09:46.080 --> 09:48.160]  We wanna kill both of you!
[09:48.380 --> 09:49.900]  Geoff is also one away.
[09:50.260 --> 09:53.320]  Oh yeah, Geoff's like, don't get me.
[09:53.660 --> 09:54.580]  What are you talking about?
[09:55.380 --> 09:56.320]  Eric's on the edge!
[09:57.100 --> 09:58.320]  Yeah, that's where I live, baby.
[09:59.920 --> 10:00.880]  Yeah, that's right!
[10:01.180 --> 10:02.840]  Come on, Gavin! We gotta go!
[10:02.920 --> 10:03.380]  Oh, he's climbing.
[10:04.420 --> 10:06.100]  Get out from my thunder couch!
[10:06.100 --> 10:07.420]  Let me...
[10:08.020 --> 10:08.460]  Gavin!
[10:09.560 --> 10:10.000]  Oh!
[10:11.440 --> 10:12.980]  Gavin, there's dicks floating everywhere!
[10:14.060 --> 10:15.760]  It's over for you.
[10:17.380 --> 10:18.540]  Nick, if you go down,
[10:18.620 --> 10:20.000]  this is over after this round.
[10:21.080 --> 10:22.540]  That was the first time I was eliminated.
[10:22.540 --> 10:24.300]  Why did you hit me? I was throwing him!
[10:24.480 --> 10:25.420]  Yeah, get out of there!
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.380]  Climb now, you idiot!
[10:28.980 --> 10:29.420]  Climb!
[10:29.760 --> 10:30.680]  Climb, you idiot!
[10:31.960 --> 10:32.660]  I'm trying!
[10:33.620 --> 10:34.500]  I'm trying!
[10:35.040 --> 10:36.380]  Nick, come on!
[10:36.500 --> 10:37.200]  I'm trying!
[10:39.480 --> 10:40.660]  Climb, he's down!
[10:40.880 --> 10:41.940]  How do I climb?
[10:42.920 --> 10:44.440]  Hold and jump for some...
[10:44.440 --> 10:45.400]  I don't know, I'm not playing!
[10:46.400 --> 10:49.120]  Hold Y and aim up with right trigger!
[10:49.300 --> 10:50.220]  Oh my god!
[10:50.280 --> 10:51.820]  Oh, you aim up. Okay, that makes sense.
[10:51.940 --> 10:55.360]  No matter what direction were you trying to climb, Nick!
[10:55.800 --> 10:56.280]  Into the wall.
[10:56.920 --> 10:57.420]  Into the wall?
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.400]  Well, Nick didn't get any wins.
[11:00.400 --> 11:01.460]  Well, no, I sure did.
[11:02.440 --> 11:03.380]  Hey, we're holding hands.
[11:06.100 --> 11:07.840]  We're all tight on the bottom wall.
[11:07.920 --> 11:09.720]  He's got the fucking crown. Get up there.
[11:14.920 --> 11:16.580]  Alright, why didn't Andrew take my spot?
[11:17.300 --> 11:18.220]  Yeah, we gotta swap.
[11:19.700 --> 11:20.700]  And then we'll just keep going
[11:20.700 --> 11:21.460]  to whoever's last.
[11:21.880 --> 11:23.040]  Oh, wait.
[11:23.560 --> 11:24.980]  We have to hit pause.
[11:25.820 --> 11:26.720]  Whoever's last, right?
[11:26.720 --> 11:27.820]  Like animals pause?
[11:28.880 --> 11:30.200]  Yeah, like animals pause.
[11:30.320 --> 11:30.960]  Exactly, Eric.
[11:32.120 --> 11:34.100]  I just realized I heated up my lunch
[11:34.100 --> 11:35.680]  and didn't get it from the microwave.
[11:36.360 --> 11:37.640]  Well, now you're out.
[11:39.420 --> 11:39.600]  Dummy.
[11:40.540 --> 11:41.580]  Yeah, it's true. You got time.
[11:42.500 --> 11:44.000]  You'll take a piss for Eric, too.
[11:45.340 --> 11:47.020]  Yeah, Nick, you piss rat.
[11:47.120 --> 11:47.620]  Right, guys?
[11:49.300 --> 11:50.520]  Hang on, hang on.
[11:50.620 --> 11:51.140]  Nobody go.
[11:51.820 --> 11:54.120]  Oh, there's already a thread on the new subreddit
[11:54.120 --> 11:55.740]  on the RegulationPod subreddit
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.840]  called LongLivePissRat.
[11:58.040 --> 11:58.420]  That's great.
[11:59.020 --> 12:00.860]  We have our first character.
[12:01.860 --> 12:02.900]  Nick exploded.
[12:04.620 --> 12:05.060]  Oh, shit.
[12:05.520 --> 12:07.380]  This isn't real, right?
[12:08.220 --> 12:08.740]  I don't know.
[12:09.660 --> 12:12.260]  Whoever wins this one does win this round.
[12:14.160 --> 12:16.320]  I think I will come in after this.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.180]  Okay, so who's out?
[12:18.720 --> 12:20.760]  I died instantly when I switched out.
[12:21.760 --> 12:23.080]  Okay, I did not load in.
[12:23.180 --> 12:24.680]  I don't think... or I died so quickly
[12:24.680 --> 12:25.760]  I wasn't even aware.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.780]  Oh, I fucking boomed myself.
[12:28.120 --> 12:28.680]  Fuck yeah.
[12:30.120 --> 12:30.920]  Get boomed, bitch.
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.660]  I boomed my own ring.
[12:34.660 --> 12:34.880]  Oh!
[12:36.080 --> 12:36.560]  Oh!
[12:37.940 --> 12:39.580]  I didn't realize it extended.
[12:39.780 --> 12:40.860]  I'm going to the top.
[12:41.460 --> 12:42.860]  Oh, the rocket.
[12:44.460 --> 12:45.340]  Watch out for the rocket.
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.560]  Oh, shit!
[12:47.560 --> 12:49.980]  Why does it explode?
[12:50.920 --> 12:51.500]  Eric, swim.
[12:52.040 --> 12:53.380]  Swim, alligator!
[12:56.200 --> 12:56.380]  Oh!
[12:59.380 --> 13:00.720]  What a fish!
[13:01.420 --> 13:02.900]  No, I grabbed the wrong thing.
[13:03.420 --> 13:04.580]  Gator's back down.
[13:05.980 --> 13:06.780]  Gator town.
[13:08.160 --> 13:09.680]  Swim, stupid
[13:09.680 --> 13:11.300]  fucking lizard. Yes!
[13:12.020 --> 13:13.260]  Climb with your dumb ass.
[13:13.260 --> 13:14.500]  Oh, he made it.
[13:14.500 --> 13:15.460]  Wow, Eric.
[13:15.560 --> 13:17.220]  Yeah, that was great.
[13:17.640 --> 13:18.860]  Lizards don't die, baby.
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.060]  Somebody throw shit at them.
[13:21.320 --> 13:22.560]  Oh, shit.
[13:22.840 --> 13:25.900]  Oh, a fist fight.
[13:26.420 --> 13:27.420]  Oh, okay.
[13:28.560 --> 13:29.620]  You won the fist fight.
[13:30.140 --> 13:30.840]  He's out to sea.
[13:31.120 --> 13:32.880]  He came back.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.300]  This is how the hunt for Red October ended.
[13:37.460 --> 13:38.020]  No!
[13:38.100 --> 13:38.940]  I got too zealous.
[13:39.400 --> 13:39.960]  No!
[13:39.960 --> 13:40.920]  What the hell is this?
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.660]  Oh, shit.
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.500]  Your hubris doomed you.
[13:46.240 --> 13:47.380]  Mighty duck.
[13:48.280 --> 13:49.920]  Mighty duck wins.
[13:50.300 --> 13:51.320]  It doesn't even matter.
[13:53.640 --> 13:55.780]  Let me in here.
[13:58.520 --> 13:59.680]  Okay, guys.
[13:59.860 --> 14:02.820]  We're down to 1800 people watching.
[14:03.020 --> 14:04.100]  We're going in the wrong direction.
[14:04.960 --> 14:06.740]  Wait, why are there five people?
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.140]  I think this might be a public session.
[14:09.140 --> 14:10.560]  I don't know who that is.
[14:10.740 --> 14:12.740]  Oh, did you guys not bother putting it on private?
[14:13.020 --> 14:14.820]  He probably did.
[14:14.920 --> 14:16.580]  We'll make a new session after this.
[14:17.620 --> 14:18.500]  Who's spectating?
[14:19.220 --> 14:20.080]  Nick is.
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.360]  And apparently he didn't have to because there's five people in here.
[14:23.980 --> 14:25.640]  Well, that's what I said in the beginning,
[14:25.760 --> 14:27.140]  but Gavin only wanted one per team.
[14:27.540 --> 14:28.280]  Well, yeah.
[14:28.520 --> 14:29.640]  There's two team members.
[14:32.860 --> 14:35.240]  So who's on a team with the fucking koala?
[14:36.240 --> 14:37.420]  Yeah, get out of here.
[14:37.420 --> 14:38.180]  Quit this one.
[14:39.520 --> 14:41.280]  Well, you're the lead. What do you mean?
[14:41.380 --> 14:42.280]  You're the party leader, Gavin.
[14:42.540 --> 14:44.120]  I can only leave. Does it end the game?
[14:44.680 --> 14:45.440]  I don't know.
[14:46.820 --> 14:48.680]  I am getting so bullied.
[14:49.160 --> 14:49.800]  We're not going.
[14:49.940 --> 14:51.600]  I'm drowning this guy.
[14:52.560 --> 14:54.180]  First of all, this guy, me.
[14:54.380 --> 14:56.040]  That guy is Andrew that you're drowning.
[14:56.160 --> 14:56.760]  That's me.
[14:58.780 --> 14:59.660]  That's me.
[15:00.320 --> 15:02.340]  No other guy I think is dead.
[15:02.920 --> 15:04.160]  He's over here with me.
[15:04.860 --> 15:05.300]  Okay.
[15:05.760 --> 15:07.800]  I've already left. Start the new...
[15:07.800 --> 15:08.460]  Okay.
[15:10.900 --> 15:11.760]  I'll just watch...
[15:11.760 --> 15:13.820]  I'm gonna watch Eric finish this dude off.
[15:14.300 --> 15:14.640]  Yeah, go ahead.
[15:15.060 --> 15:16.800]  They told me that I quit.
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.400]  I'm fucking out of here.
[15:19.700 --> 15:21.080]  They said, yeah, we're leaving.
[15:21.200 --> 15:21.420]  Great.
[15:23.280 --> 15:24.040]  Let's do it.
[15:25.380 --> 15:27.000]  Didn't need to put the code in.
[15:27.460 --> 15:27.620]  No.
[15:29.640 --> 15:31.160]  Only if you join on your own.
[15:32.540 --> 15:34.780]  Gavin and Geoff used to be better online friends.
[15:34.820 --> 15:35.480]  How dare you?
[15:36.520 --> 15:36.960]  Yeah.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.880]  We've never been good online friends.
[15:40.940 --> 15:41.480]  That's the problem.
[15:41.600 --> 15:42.700]  We're only good in real life.
[15:43.480 --> 15:45.740]  We had a run where we would play online a lot.
[15:45.820 --> 15:47.800]  But you fell asleep quite a lot.
[15:48.140 --> 15:49.840]  Yeah, I was drinking pretty heavily.
[15:50.160 --> 15:53.860]  In my defense, I was very drunk, Gavin.
[15:54.840 --> 15:55.400]  I get that.
[15:55.800 --> 15:57.160]  I'm gonna be...
[15:57.160 --> 15:59.500]  I'm the otter.
[15:59.500 --> 16:00.520]  Who do I want to be?
[16:00.900 --> 16:04.500]  Shout out to everyone in chat who's subscribed to the Patreon already.
[16:05.760 --> 16:06.760]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[16:07.500 --> 16:09.640]  Hey, thank you so much for subscribing to the Patreon.
[16:12.100 --> 16:13.180]  Louis MPSU said,
[16:13.340 --> 16:14.180]  I made you cry
[16:14.180 --> 16:14.900]  in Restoration.
[16:15.380 --> 16:17.660]  Was that because I did such a shitty job voice acting?
[16:17.800 --> 16:18.160]  I'm sorry.
[16:19.200 --> 16:20.420]  21 years and I never got any better.
[16:20.620 --> 16:21.800]  I'm sure that's what they meant.
[16:22.180 --> 16:24.800]  I'm sure that's exactly what they were trying to convey.
[16:26.580 --> 16:28.000]  We're playing this level again?
[16:28.000 --> 16:28.720]  What?
[16:30.800 --> 16:33.080]  I don't understand how we're doing this.
[16:33.080 --> 16:34.400]  I didn't get to play this level.
[16:34.520 --> 16:35.240]  I like this level.
[16:35.440 --> 16:36.700]  I'm not allowed to enjoy levels?
[16:37.980 --> 16:40.300]  I will say, you didn't fucking
[16:40.300 --> 16:41.400]  make this on purpose.
[16:41.820 --> 16:42.960]  No fucking shot.
[16:43.460 --> 16:44.840]  No fucking shot.
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.640]  I played a level last night
[16:48.640 --> 16:50.500]  that was on a bridge
[16:50.500 --> 16:52.460]  that was collapsing as we were on it.
[16:52.480 --> 16:53.380]  It's the best level.
[16:53.680 --> 16:55.760]  We should definitely play this level again, surely.
[16:55.760 --> 16:56.980]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[16:57.080 --> 16:58.520]  We should quit out of this fucking level.
[16:59.200 --> 17:01.140]  No, we're not quitting and making another one.
[17:01.700 --> 17:04.160]  Let's just let Andrew win real fast
[17:04.160 --> 17:04.900]  and then we can switch.
[17:05.180 --> 17:06.280]  I'm okay with this.
[17:07.140 --> 17:08.960]  Oh no, the tennis racket.
[17:09.220 --> 17:11.160]  Oh, it's a triple shot.
[17:12.560 --> 17:13.080]  Gavin!
[17:13.460 --> 17:13.960]  Gavin!
[17:15.880 --> 17:16.920]  Oh no.
[17:17.540 --> 17:18.440]  Gavin is dead.
[17:19.360 --> 17:19.600]  How do I?
[17:21.680 --> 17:22.200]  No!
[17:22.200 --> 17:22.940]  No!
[17:23.940 --> 17:24.240]  Fuck!
[17:25.900 --> 17:27.360]  Climb, you fucking cat!
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.800]  Get off me!
[17:30.940 --> 17:31.960]  Wow, who won?
[17:32.640 --> 17:33.440]  Someone else won?
[17:33.700 --> 17:34.760]  Who was that?
[17:36.020 --> 17:37.220]  Who was that?
[17:38.060 --> 17:39.400]  Yes, this is real!
[17:39.740 --> 17:40.380]  You're a fool!
[17:40.700 --> 17:41.200]  You're a fool!
[17:43.420 --> 17:45.060]  You are a fool, Gavin!
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.420]  You said I can't play
[17:47.920 --> 17:48.920]  and then I play
[17:48.920 --> 17:50.840]  and I'm not allowed to play on this level
[17:50.840 --> 17:51.740]  that I didn't play.
[17:54.720 --> 17:55.840]  It's a great level!
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.040]  You think it's the first level?
[17:58.360 --> 18:00.700]  Why would they make it the first level if it wasn't a great level?
[18:01.000 --> 18:03.320]  It's the introductory easy level
[18:03.320 --> 18:03.840]  for babies.
[18:04.500 --> 18:05.680]  It's a baby level.
[18:05.740 --> 18:09.080]  We all didn't stay up until 6am playing this game last night.
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.720]  I didn't either, I only stayed up until 3.
[18:11.480 --> 18:11.900]  Hey, Andrew.
[18:13.280 --> 18:15.180]  It's only 1 o'clock, your time.
[18:16.000 --> 18:16.480]  Yeah.
[18:18.000 --> 18:19.320]  Come on, baby!
[18:19.800 --> 18:21.120]  We're gonna go over here, little baby!
[18:21.160 --> 18:22.160]  How do I turn that down?
[18:22.540 --> 18:24.520]  The knob on your focus rate.
[18:24.740 --> 18:25.220]  I'm trapped.
[18:26.100 --> 18:26.960]  Did I die?
[18:27.180 --> 18:30.920]  I think I turned it down.
[18:31.860 --> 18:32.980]  If you went left, it's down.
[18:33.940 --> 18:35.340]  Just so you guys know,
[18:35.720 --> 18:36.740]  if you're watching this,
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.240]  we're much better in recorded form
[18:39.240 --> 18:41.280]  than we are in live.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.660]  We're much better on different levels.
[18:44.560 --> 18:45.580]  I wouldn't know.
[18:45.700 --> 18:47.260]  Get out of here with that pan!
[18:47.620 --> 18:47.840]  No!
[18:49.220 --> 18:50.620]  Andrew, just a little more.
[18:51.900 --> 18:52.960]  Just a little more.
[18:53.200 --> 18:53.700]  What about now?
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.580]  I twisted it quite a bit.
[18:56.740 --> 18:58.280]  It's possible I'm not twisting the right one.
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.640]  You actually killed me.
[19:00.040 --> 19:03.100]  Whichever one has the XLR input going next to it
[19:03.100 --> 19:03.960]  is the one you want to turn.
[19:05.580 --> 19:06.640]  There you go, you got it!
[19:07.500 --> 19:07.780]  Okay.
[19:08.280 --> 19:09.560]  I was twisting the wrong one.
[19:10.020 --> 19:11.480]  I don't know what I was twisting.
[19:12.600 --> 19:13.260]  That's cool.
[19:14.680 --> 19:15.520]  Don't read stuff.
[19:15.600 --> 19:16.660]  I got knocked stupid.
[19:19.580 --> 19:20.840]  Gavin, I believe in you.
[19:21.080 --> 19:22.420]  You already know this level so well.
[19:23.360 --> 19:24.760]  It's the best level, apparently.
[19:25.320 --> 19:25.640]  It is!
[19:27.880 --> 19:30.540]  I'm really excited to play the submarine level again.
[19:30.640 --> 19:31.320]  How about you guys?
[19:31.560 --> 19:32.100]  Get him!
[19:33.600 --> 19:34.960]  Oh my god!
[19:34.960 --> 19:35.700]  That's the best!
[19:35.700 --> 19:35.980]  Oh!
[19:36.960 --> 19:38.680]  I want credit for that kill!
[19:38.960 --> 19:40.860]  I want credit for that kill!
[19:40.980 --> 19:41.580]  That was incredible.
[19:42.600 --> 19:45.300]  That incredible moment was brought to you by this level.
[19:46.020 --> 19:46.700]  That I picked.
[19:49.460 --> 19:51.260]  Also brought to you by our brand new Patreon.
[19:51.520 --> 19:51.980]  Check it out.
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.280]  Grabbing the shovel.
[19:56.960 --> 19:58.960]  How do you throw this without killing yourself?
[19:59.620 --> 20:00.020]  Run away!
[20:00.020 --> 20:01.180]  Try it.
[20:01.460 --> 20:04.520]  I want it.
[20:05.520 --> 20:06.460]  Fill your boots.
[20:07.240 --> 20:08.540]  No I don't!
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.120]  That's terrifying.
[20:10.360 --> 20:12.300]  I've been thinking about this question for a while.
[20:12.440 --> 20:12.980]  Can we get nitro?
[20:15.540 --> 20:16.580]  Why not?
[20:17.760 --> 20:18.660]  What can we get?
[20:18.900 --> 20:19.840]  We'll give it our audio quality.
[20:21.020 --> 20:21.780]  That's a good bump.
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.140]  You know what?
[20:26.300 --> 20:28.060]  Maybe if Rooster Teeth got nitro,
[20:28.060 --> 20:29.040]  we'd still be around.
[20:29.940 --> 20:30.980]  Hey Geoff,
[20:31.240 --> 20:33.220]  I don't think that's true at all.
[20:33.880 --> 20:35.960]  You don't think it was the nitro holding us back?
[20:36.320 --> 20:36.700]  No.
[20:37.920 --> 20:38.960]  Somebody says
[20:40.000 --> 20:41.060]  Nick is quiet.
[20:42.320 --> 20:43.620]  I was also away from the mic.
[20:43.640 --> 20:45.120]  Damn, I knocked myself out.
[20:46.180 --> 20:46.700]  Headbutt!
[20:48.340 --> 20:50.620]  Let me bang your head on this knocker.
[20:55.360 --> 20:56.220]  Knocker death!
[20:57.400 --> 20:58.320]  Look out!
[21:01.440 --> 21:02.560]  Bombs away!
[21:06.260 --> 21:07.300]  Tenderize the duck!
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.040]  Looks like you're tenderizing something.
[21:14.840 --> 21:15.960]  Oh god!
[21:16.680 --> 21:17.060]  Get away!
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.420]  Actually, don't get away. Come here.
[21:19.880 --> 21:20.700]  I want to show you something.
[21:21.340 --> 21:22.800]  Look at this cool bat I found.
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.420]  Let me dig a bean hole in your forehead.
[21:28.500 --> 21:28.900]  No!
[21:40.840 --> 21:41.760]  Now's your time to shine.
[21:43.520 --> 21:44.480]  I don't like that.
[21:45.400 --> 21:46.180]  I don't like that.
[21:46.180 --> 21:46.960]  Get away from me, gorilla!
[21:47.980 --> 21:48.480]  Oh!
[21:49.760 --> 21:52.160]  No, the ice!
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.320]  The ice!
[21:53.580 --> 21:54.180]  Get out!
[21:55.800 --> 21:56.480]  Run away!
[21:57.120 --> 21:58.080]  The ice!
[21:59.020 --> 21:59.660]  Push him!
[22:02.780 --> 22:04.060]  What's up, PhoenixEdits?
[22:04.100 --> 22:04.520]  How you doing?
[22:05.660 --> 22:07.500]  It's so cool to see all these people
[22:07.500 --> 22:08.880]  in the comments.
[22:09.380 --> 22:12.440]  Andrew, we have to stop him.
[22:12.920 --> 22:13.420]  Andrew!
[22:14.220 --> 22:15.920]  I'm trying to kick you over the side.
[22:17.360 --> 22:19.880]  Gavin, we have to stop this guy.
[22:20.300 --> 22:21.420]  Yeah, we'll get him.
[22:23.020 --> 22:24.340]  I'm trying to figure out how to...
[22:24.340 --> 22:26.300]  Get up! Push him off the side!
[22:27.460 --> 22:28.760]  Just leave him right there.
[22:29.080 --> 22:29.520]  No!
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.680]  He's fucking weak now.
[22:36.080 --> 22:38.440]  You son of a bitch!
[22:38.700 --> 22:39.420]  Push him!
[22:41.060 --> 22:42.320]  He's too slippery!
[22:42.680 --> 22:43.960]  You're slipping all the right way!
[22:44.080 --> 22:45.100]  My gun!
[22:45.720 --> 22:46.100]  No!
[22:46.980 --> 22:49.360]  You knocked me out mid-throw!
[22:50.120 --> 22:50.840]  No!
[22:51.600 --> 22:53.740]  Yes, the cat does it again, baby!
[22:56.100 --> 22:57.760]  Cat wins again!
[23:01.620 --> 23:02.180]  Come here!
[23:03.260 --> 23:03.500]  Come here!
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.840]  Come here!
[23:07.400 --> 23:09.820]  What did that potion do?
[23:09.820 --> 23:11.520]  I think it was gonna make me invisible.
[23:13.080 --> 23:14.920]  You knocked the hell out of my gullet.
[23:15.120 --> 23:15.640]  You ain't welcome!
[23:17.600 --> 23:19.820]  Oh, you son of a bitch!
[23:20.160 --> 23:21.400]  I got a butt shovel!
[23:22.000 --> 23:22.940]  Get out of here!
[23:26.320 --> 23:27.680]  Oh, come over here!
[23:28.480 --> 23:30.140]  Oh, my bum! You slapped it!
[23:30.800 --> 23:31.960]  Like a fucking Beyblade!
[23:32.960 --> 23:33.860]  Spitting you out!
[23:35.520 --> 23:36.540]  Get out of here!
[23:36.540 --> 23:38.500]  You knocked my hat off!
[23:39.560 --> 23:40.640]  Do it again!
[23:41.040 --> 23:41.880]  You're going hatless?
[23:42.600 --> 23:43.600]  I didn't mean to.
[23:44.080 --> 23:45.440]  You fucking domed me.
[23:47.100 --> 23:48.880]  You almost domed yourself there.
[23:51.340 --> 23:52.420]  Stop! Get away from me!
[23:52.780 --> 23:53.560]  That's how you climb.
[23:54.240 --> 23:55.420]  I don't know.
[23:56.340 --> 23:58.140]  How did you do it?
[24:00.800 --> 24:02.080]  Holy shit!
[24:02.080 --> 24:04.190]  Oh, my God!
[24:07.120 --> 24:08.400]  This is crazy!
[24:08.620 --> 24:09.440]  It's so stupid!
[24:10.160 --> 24:10.520]  No!
[24:10.900 --> 24:11.780]  Son of a bitch!
[24:13.820 --> 24:17.220]  There's a real juxtaposition between what's happening here and beyond.
[24:17.400 --> 24:17.580]  Yeah.
[24:18.460 --> 24:20.180]  This is an accident, but I like this.
[24:26.880 --> 24:28.500]  It's really heated down there.
[24:28.680 --> 24:29.680]  It sure is.
[24:29.680 --> 24:30.140]  Tennis!
[24:31.520 --> 24:32.120]  Tennis!
[24:32.280 --> 24:33.040]  Tennis, anyone?
[24:34.160 --> 24:34.760]  No!
[24:37.640 --> 24:38.240]  No!
[24:38.720 --> 24:39.320]  Geoff!
[24:39.700 --> 24:40.240]  No!
[24:41.400 --> 24:43.380]  Yeah, you're done!
[24:43.960 --> 24:44.060]  No!
[24:46.320 --> 24:48.380]  I've got the full window of action.
[24:49.240 --> 24:49.940]  Here it is.
[24:52.480 --> 24:52.840]  Get away!
[24:53.080 --> 24:53.820]  Geoff, get away!
[24:54.540 --> 24:55.900]  Geoff, you went the other way!
[24:55.900 --> 24:57.600]  Oh, you motherfuckers!
[24:58.660 --> 25:00.260]  You dropped me off the top rope!
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.200]  I wanted to jump off and attack, but...
[25:04.200 --> 25:05.180]  I don't have to do it.
[25:06.540 --> 25:06.980]  Oh, man.
[25:07.140 --> 25:07.800]  Get off my beach!
[25:10.540 --> 25:11.500]  Uh-oh.
[25:12.320 --> 25:13.280]  Uh-oh.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.280]  Yeah, you're not that invisible, bud.
[25:17.100 --> 25:17.380]  Uh-oh.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.480]  I was already dead!
[25:20.280 --> 25:20.920]  Uh-oh!
[25:21.840 --> 25:23.760]  Climb, Cat! Use your claws!
[25:26.040 --> 25:27.020]  Oh, no!
[25:28.480 --> 25:29.100]  Get up, Eric!
[25:29.460 --> 25:30.480]  Get up, Eric!
[25:31.640 --> 25:33.300]  Gavy wins again.
[25:33.640 --> 25:35.120]  This is my level, apparently.
[25:37.320 --> 25:41.740]  Somebody said, can't believe Geoff is gonna play bingo during the Celtics game.
[25:42.100 --> 25:44.160]  Neither can Geoff, but here we are.
[25:44.500 --> 25:45.900]  That's how dedicated he is.
[25:46.020 --> 25:46.480]  We can do both, Geoff.
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.820]  That is how much I care about my fucking career.
[25:49.020 --> 25:49.580]  We can do both.
[25:51.860 --> 25:53.620]  We're bringing it home, son. Don't worry.
[25:56.020 --> 25:57.400]  I think you made a great point, Gavin.
[25:57.500 --> 25:59.860]  If there's only one winner, there could be multiple people tied for last.
[25:59.940 --> 26:01.920]  Maybe you swap, maybe there's winners going forward.
[26:01.940 --> 26:02.320]  I'll spectate.
[26:03.940 --> 26:05.500]  Can we, like, change levels?
[26:06.360 --> 26:07.880]  Or does Angel want to play this one, too?
[26:08.700 --> 26:09.760]  Well, I never played this one, either.
[26:09.760 --> 26:11.020]  Wouldn't it be great if we could play it?
[26:11.120 --> 26:13.080]  But these are the only levels we did in the Let's Plays.
[26:13.460 --> 26:15.140]  Okay, well, then let's just hop off the side.
[26:15.460 --> 26:16.460]  Let's just hop off.
[26:18.500 --> 26:21.220]  Why don't we just hop on to a different level?
[26:21.500 --> 26:23.040]  Do you want me to make a whole new lobby?
[26:23.760 --> 26:25.960]  I just want to try to get everyone in the air.
[26:26.040 --> 26:27.180]  I just want to play different levels.
[26:27.520 --> 26:29.140]  Okay, well, then let's all just turn off the side.
[26:30.280 --> 26:30.940]  Yeah, I do.
[26:33.160 --> 26:34.820]  I'm in the ocean. I'm swimming.
[26:35.800 --> 26:36.860]  Let's see how far I can get.
[26:37.600 --> 26:37.820]  Yeah.
[26:39.340 --> 26:39.700]  Paddle.
[26:41.660 --> 26:43.860]  I guess, am I going to where Gavin is?
[26:43.860 --> 26:44.720]  I'm racing the duck.
[26:45.120 --> 26:47.560]  I'm racing the duck. Who would think a gorilla would be faster than a duck?
[26:47.560 --> 26:48.980]  Yeah, you swap with Gavin.
[26:49.560 --> 26:50.020]  Okay.
[26:51.740 --> 26:52.040]  Who won?
[26:53.180 --> 26:54.060]  Of course, Gavin.
[26:54.700 --> 26:55.400]  Yeah, big surprise.
[26:58.040 --> 26:58.880]  I'm going forward.
[26:59.780 --> 27:00.800]  I'm getting to the shore.
[27:02.820 --> 27:03.840]  I'm going all the way.
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.560]  Oh, I'm slower than the current by a lot.
[27:07.820 --> 27:08.500]  Oh, no.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.760]  Oh, I'm going to hit you, Geoff.
[27:14.820 --> 27:15.960]  Can I swim?
[27:15.960 --> 27:17.680]  Do you think this is faster than starting a new one or no?
[27:17.680 --> 27:17.900]  No.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.600]  I think it's more visually engaging.
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.520]  You think this is more engaging?
[27:23.140 --> 27:24.820]  How many times in your life...
[27:24.820 --> 27:26.160]  I don't agree with that at all.
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.000]  How many times in your life are you going to get the opportunity to see a gorilla drown in the ocean?
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.400]  Hopefully three.
[27:33.660 --> 27:34.780]  And then we can get out of here.
[27:38.300 --> 27:39.040]  I'm here now.
[27:39.920 --> 27:40.620]  There we go.
[27:41.520 --> 27:41.920]  Goodbye.
[27:41.920 --> 27:42.780]  Goodbye.
[27:43.520 --> 27:46.420]  Wait, why do we have different...
[27:46.420 --> 27:48.440]  Why do we have two different winners?
[27:51.460 --> 27:53.420]  Okay, okay.
[27:53.540 --> 27:55.580]  I'll do that. Jesus Christ. Relax.
[27:57.800 --> 27:59.080]  That's what it took?
[27:59.720 --> 28:01.500]  He's being real whiny about it.
[28:01.600 --> 28:02.580]  I guess I'll go do that.
[28:05.280 --> 28:07.940]  I mean, if you guys would have died properly...
[28:08.780 --> 28:10.620]  So do we need to leave?
[28:10.760 --> 28:11.400]  Or what's going on?
[28:11.640 --> 28:13.300]  Yeah, that's why I didn't want to do this.
[28:13.380 --> 28:14.900]  Because we have to leave and do a whole thing...
[28:14.900 --> 28:17.000]  Well, this is a great opportunity to say...
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.820]  While we're setting this lobby up...
[28:18.820 --> 28:22.220]  If you haven't had a chance yet to check out our Patreon...
[28:22.880 --> 28:23.760]  Regulation awaits.
[28:24.420 --> 28:25.600]  Just go to...
[28:25.600 --> 28:28.420]  What is it? Patreon.com...
[28:28.420 --> 28:29.860]  Slash Regulation Pod.
[28:30.260 --> 28:32.820]  I believe there's a clickable link on our Twitch profile.
[28:33.040 --> 28:33.660]  Yeah, there you go.
[28:34.580 --> 28:35.240]  Click on that.
[28:35.240 --> 28:36.200]  And then go like...
[28:36.200 --> 28:37.840]  And then...
[28:38.760 --> 28:40.720]  Put in your mom's credit card number...
[28:40.720 --> 28:41.160]  And you're good to go.
[28:44.020 --> 28:45.060]  I agree with that.
[28:45.160 --> 28:45.420]  Yes.
[28:47.500 --> 28:49.140]  If there's one thing...
[28:49.140 --> 28:50.760]  Parents love...
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.120]  It's when their kids use their credit cards...
[28:53.120 --> 28:53.960]  For online purchases.
[28:55.560 --> 28:57.640]  Andrew, you shouldn't need to send us a code.
[28:57.680 --> 28:58.520]  You can just invite us.
[28:58.900 --> 28:59.880]  Yeah, remember last time?
[29:00.340 --> 29:02.460]  That was so cool.
[29:02.460 --> 29:04.000]  You did such a cool job with that.
[29:04.240 --> 29:05.000]  I liked it.
[29:05.060 --> 29:06.260]  I was impressed.
[29:06.480 --> 29:09.500]  I thought it was going to be one way...
[29:09.500 --> 29:10.680]  But then it was a much easier way.
[29:10.780 --> 29:13.220]  And it was only because of your ingenuity that we got there.
[29:14.980 --> 29:16.060]  Uh, let's see.
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.320]  I feel like usually I'm on the receiving end of that version of Geoff.
[29:21.620 --> 29:22.520]  What, positive?
[29:24.400 --> 29:25.280]  I invited...
[29:25.280 --> 29:25.840]  You're welcome.
[29:26.640 --> 29:27.440]  Nick and Gavin.
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.640]  If you're mean, everybody's like...
[29:31.060 --> 29:32.380]  If you're mean, everybody's like...
[29:32.960 --> 29:34.440]  I don't think anyone goes,
[29:34.620 --> 29:35.540]  Uh, Geoff's nice.
[29:35.700 --> 29:36.980]  Yeah, they say that a lot.
[29:37.280 --> 29:39.260]  Gavin just did it.
[29:39.500 --> 29:41.300]  You know how they're saying it all the time?
[29:43.920 --> 29:45.380]  I think that's your inner voice.
[29:45.800 --> 29:45.960]  Alright.
[29:46.900 --> 29:47.800]  Let me switch back.
[29:48.020 --> 29:49.340]  This is how you all sound to me.
[29:49.780 --> 29:50.880]  Uh, Geoff...
[29:52.200 --> 29:53.300]  That was pretty good.
[29:53.540 --> 29:55.480]  You got it. I'm here.
[29:55.660 --> 29:58.920]  I can set this one out if you guys want.
[29:58.920 --> 29:59.960]  I haven't set one out yet.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.540]  You want to set it out?
[30:02.880 --> 30:03.620]  I don't mind.
[30:05.160 --> 30:06.560]  I don't mind setting the first one.
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.640]  I really don't.
[30:08.640 --> 30:09.980]  Are we all happy with the level?
[30:10.360 --> 30:11.760]  We've played the plane before.
[30:12.300 --> 30:14.180]  Yeah, go to a different one.
[30:14.220 --> 30:14.800]  We already did that one.
[30:15.760 --> 30:16.860]  Boring. Next.
[30:19.220 --> 30:19.580]  Boring.
[30:20.700 --> 30:21.700]  That's pretty bad.
[30:24.700 --> 30:26.100]  Everybody's favorite characters.
[30:26.340 --> 30:26.920]  There we go.
[30:27.640 --> 30:28.680]  Somebody says...
[30:28.680 --> 30:30.140]  Oh, Wild Tina sighting.
[30:30.260 --> 30:31.360]  Hi, Tina.
[30:31.840 --> 30:33.960]  Tina was in my chat earlier, too.
[30:34.140 --> 30:35.740]  It was my birthday yesterday.
[30:35.860 --> 30:37.200]  She gifted me 38 subs.
[30:37.640 --> 30:37.680]  Wow.
[30:40.680 --> 30:43.920]  Tina's maybe one of the most thoughtful people I know.
[30:44.500 --> 30:47.100]  And you know a lot of thoughtless people.
[30:48.480 --> 30:49.860]  Tina actually helped us.
[30:49.980 --> 30:52.080]  I don't think we would be as far as...
[30:52.080 --> 30:52.520]  I agree.
[30:52.520 --> 30:53.600]  If it wasn't for Tina.
[30:53.960 --> 30:56.440]  If it wasn't for the Tinas and the Rays
[30:56.440 --> 30:58.740]  and the Megs of the world, we would...
[30:59.640 --> 31:00.680]  We'd still have
[31:00.680 --> 31:02.180]  each other's thumbs up our asses.
[31:03.220 --> 31:06.360]  You got the Miami Heat shark?
[31:06.840 --> 31:08.380]  I'm the Miami Heat shark, baby.
[31:08.460 --> 31:10.000]  Dude, you're Jimmy Butler?
[31:10.220 --> 31:11.060]  That's awesome.
[31:11.760 --> 31:13.960]  Look at his face. That's Tyler Hero.
[31:15.080 --> 31:16.020]  I hate him.
[31:16.020 --> 31:19.100]  Om nom nom.
[31:19.320 --> 31:20.040]  Om nom nom.
[31:20.040 --> 31:20.480]  You guys are fighting.
[31:20.700 --> 31:22.340]  I didn't know that.
[31:24.660 --> 31:25.160]  Oh!
[31:25.600 --> 31:25.920]  Get up.
[31:26.280 --> 31:29.300]  I haven't killed myself with the boomerang.
[31:29.580 --> 31:30.060]  Shit.
[31:31.280 --> 31:33.280]  I'm a shark. Why is this a problem?
[31:33.800 --> 31:35.560]  You should be fine down there, dude.
[31:35.680 --> 31:36.160]  Hey, Gavin.
[31:37.060 --> 31:37.620]  Rip.
[31:39.720 --> 31:40.840]  Oh, wow.
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.420]  I went.
[31:42.420 --> 31:44.060]  No, let me go, Geoff.
[31:44.080 --> 31:45.780]  Oh, no.
[31:46.060 --> 31:47.260]  Oh, I'm so fucked.
[31:47.280 --> 31:49.400]  Oh, no.
[31:50.900 --> 31:52.420]  You have to go.
[31:53.040 --> 31:53.300]  Gavin.
[31:53.740 --> 31:55.340]  You're my only hope.
[31:55.600 --> 31:56.360]  Gavin.
[31:59.300 --> 32:00.140]  No.
[32:01.280 --> 32:02.120]  Geoff.
[32:02.460 --> 32:03.080]  Geoff.
[32:04.040 --> 32:04.180]  No.
[32:05.100 --> 32:06.140]  Soup's on.
[32:08.060 --> 32:08.780]  I died.
[32:08.780 --> 32:10.220]  Oh, shit.
[32:10.820 --> 32:12.340]  Soup's on.
[32:12.580 --> 32:13.760]  It's only a cast iron.
[32:13.860 --> 32:17.160]  That bomb was like a bullet.
[32:17.660 --> 32:18.480]  That was crazy.
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.180]  Oh, god.
[32:22.580 --> 32:23.940]  Get back, little monkey.
[32:24.420 --> 32:26.900]  Get out of here.
[32:27.560 --> 32:28.060]  Let me have it.
[32:28.260 --> 32:28.480]  Gavin.
[32:31.060 --> 32:32.800]  Geoff, my god.
[32:33.940 --> 32:35.300]  You can't stop me.
[32:35.520 --> 32:35.760]  Gavin.
[32:35.760 --> 32:35.900]  Gavin.
[32:37.820 --> 32:39.200]  I'm Andy Serkis.
[32:43.200 --> 32:45.000]  I died so early in this.
[32:45.100 --> 32:45.520]  I didn't do anything.
[32:45.660 --> 32:46.300]  Yeah, you were done.
[32:46.380 --> 32:47.140]  Oh, there goes Gavin.
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.780]  I ran out.
[32:52.180 --> 32:53.820]  I went on a different side.
[32:55.280 --> 32:55.440]  Geoff.
[32:58.360 --> 32:59.320]  Oh, no.
[33:04.780 --> 33:05.740]  Oh, no.
[33:05.740 --> 33:06.700]  Everyone's frozen.
[33:07.260 --> 33:09.500]  Nick got it.
[33:09.520 --> 33:10.400]  Way to go, dude.
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.120]  I froze last.
[33:13.060 --> 33:14.720]  I froze last.
[33:15.280 --> 33:17.680]  The last surviving person from the Titanic.
[33:18.140 --> 33:18.720]  I did it.
[33:20.060 --> 33:22.320]  Get your hands off my mallet end.
[33:23.080 --> 33:24.920]  Oh, my god.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.640]  Ice cold rabbit.
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.360]  I got Pepsi.
[33:33.680 --> 33:34.480]  I got Pepsi.
[33:35.560 --> 33:36.060]  Pepsi.
[33:41.200 --> 33:42.440]  Sewing machine in on you.
[33:42.840 --> 33:44.100]  I'm sewing machine in on you.
[33:44.200 --> 33:44.800]  Look at the wiggle.
[33:48.780 --> 33:49.780]  What's this?
[33:50.700 --> 33:51.760]  It's a banana peel.
[33:52.320 --> 33:53.080]  Get out of my banana peel.
[33:53.760 --> 33:54.260]  No.
[33:55.760 --> 33:56.920]  Get away from me.
[33:56.920 --> 33:57.540]  Get up, buddy boy.
[33:59.380 --> 34:00.780]  Stainless steel motherfucker.
[34:01.480 --> 34:02.400]  Oh, my god.
[34:02.600 --> 34:03.900]  He's invisible, but it's just...
[34:03.900 --> 34:06.440]  You don't know where I am.
[34:06.760 --> 34:07.620]  You don't know where I am.
[34:07.860 --> 34:08.840]  I see you now.
[34:10.600 --> 34:11.560]  Get up.
[34:12.620 --> 34:13.140]  There we go.
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.540]  The sewing machine.
[34:16.580 --> 34:17.180]  The sewing machine.
[34:18.180 --> 34:18.880]  Oh, no.
[34:19.240 --> 34:19.560]  Oh, no.
[34:21.600 --> 34:23.100]  I'm getting away from that.
[34:23.100 --> 34:24.120]  No, Gavin.
[34:25.920 --> 34:28.020]  I got to...
[34:28.020 --> 34:29.500]  Go, buddy.
[34:30.360 --> 34:31.780]  God damn it, Gavin.
[34:32.260 --> 34:32.740]  Shit.
[34:34.340 --> 34:34.880]  Let me out.
[34:38.060 --> 34:40.180]  This is Gavin's game, man.
[34:40.240 --> 34:40.880]  Pick me up, Gavin.
[34:41.440 --> 34:42.600]  Let me get you.
[34:43.840 --> 34:44.520]  Oh, shit.
[34:47.860 --> 34:48.900]  All right, here we go.
[34:48.900 --> 34:50.420]  Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[34:50.560 --> 34:52.900]  Everything is going invisible and then holding an item.
[34:54.660 --> 34:55.140]  No.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.600]  We're going down together.
[34:58.640 --> 34:59.640]  Group up, everyone.
[35:03.380 --> 35:05.520]  There's no one on the ice apart from the shark.
[35:07.380 --> 35:09.460]  How did the guy holding the bomb stay on the thing?
[35:11.940 --> 35:13.500]  He used us as shields.
[35:17.940 --> 35:19.040]  I'm not hitting anything.
[35:19.400 --> 35:20.600]  I'm going to try to break the snow.
[35:21.680 --> 35:22.940]  Get a break in the ice.
[35:27.220 --> 35:28.540]  Get on the good ice.
[35:28.700 --> 35:30.580]  Get out of the water.
[35:31.360 --> 35:32.840]  It's too cold for a monkey.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.460]  He's not in for this.
[35:40.500 --> 35:41.380]  It's reloading.
[35:41.380 --> 35:43.740]  Die, die, die.
[35:44.040 --> 35:44.780]  You too.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.100]  Everyone die.
[35:50.400 --> 35:52.660]  Get out of here, you son of a bitch.
[35:53.600 --> 35:54.460]  Don't do it.
[35:54.980 --> 35:55.500]  No, Gavin.
[35:56.240 --> 35:57.060]  Gavin, we're business partners.
[35:58.460 --> 36:00.320]  We're business partners.
[36:01.760 --> 36:03.180]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[36:05.140 --> 36:07.080]  Do you know what was cool?
[36:07.640 --> 36:07.920]  What's that?
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.460]  I just want to go home.
[36:08.720 --> 36:11.000]  Creating a company with you guys and getting to name it.
[36:11.180 --> 36:11.580]  Hell yeah.
[36:12.300 --> 36:15.400]  Finding out that the dumbest name ever didn't already exist.
[36:16.640 --> 36:17.660]  It's pretty exciting.
[36:21.340 --> 36:22.660]  I'm going to head home.
[36:24.840 --> 36:26.220]  The shark's out of here.
[36:26.400 --> 36:27.400]  He doesn't want to play.
[36:27.980 --> 36:29.140]  You better swim, bud.
[36:32.000 --> 36:32.380]  No.
[36:37.920 --> 36:38.840]  I'm going to go back to Miami.
[36:41.980 --> 36:42.460]  Fuck.
[36:44.380 --> 36:46.380]  He slid all the way across.
[36:49.080 --> 36:52.380]  Hey, guess what?
[36:53.680 --> 36:55.540]  Striking distance LLC is not us.
[36:55.600 --> 36:56.180]  That's the other thing.
[36:56.600 --> 36:58.440]  Why would that be them?
[36:58.840 --> 36:59.600]  What are you talking about?
[36:59.840 --> 37:01.580]  We're a very regulation company.
[37:01.580 --> 37:02.700]  Who?
[37:05.780 --> 37:07.880]  Oh my god.
[37:08.040 --> 37:08.820]  Andrew, attack.
[37:09.560 --> 37:10.360]  I'm attacking.
[37:10.760 --> 37:11.780]  You aren't.
[37:12.680 --> 37:14.800]  I'm processing my moves.
[37:16.940 --> 37:17.620]  Evaluating.
[37:17.740 --> 37:18.180]  My hubris.
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.940]  You know what?
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.900]  I shouldn't have evaluated that.
[37:23.040 --> 37:24.780]  That was a waste of time.
[37:25.980 --> 37:27.500]  You KO'd me in the water.
[37:28.540 --> 37:28.860]  Freeze.
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.000]  Gavin.
[37:31.940 --> 37:33.020]  You're too wily.
[37:33.300 --> 37:33.720]  Freeze.
[37:35.140 --> 37:36.380]  Why won't you freeze?
[37:38.340 --> 37:39.900]  Why won't you just die?
[37:41.400 --> 37:42.760]  Gavin, please. It's so cold.
[37:43.000 --> 37:43.940]  Die with me.
[37:44.220 --> 37:45.500]  Come on, you little bitch.
[37:45.660 --> 37:46.640]  Die with me. How about that?
[37:46.920 --> 37:47.580]  Let's die together.
[37:50.500 --> 37:52.060]  Gavin's taking this fucking thing, man.
[37:52.580 --> 37:53.440]  Gavin, it's so cold.
[37:55.820 --> 37:56.660]  No way.
[37:56.660 --> 37:58.360]  How did Shark make it across?
[37:59.720 --> 38:00.880]  Where is he?
[38:01.160 --> 38:03.120]  Gavin, you son of a bitch.
[38:03.560 --> 38:04.940]  Give me this.
[38:05.400 --> 38:06.040]  Oh.
[38:06.940 --> 38:07.940]  Direct hit.
[38:08.920 --> 38:10.300]  He's taking my glasses off.
[38:10.320 --> 38:12.300]  I'm weighing you down with those sticks.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.980]  Oh shit. Fish.
[38:17.540 --> 38:18.820]  Double fished.
[38:18.980 --> 38:19.540]  You did it.
[38:20.400 --> 38:22.740]  Are you guys trying to tell me
[38:22.740 --> 38:24.180]  that if I went to
[38:24.180 --> 38:25.820]  patreon.com
[38:26.680 --> 38:27.640]  regulation pod
[38:27.640 --> 38:30.160]  and gave you money, I could see this
[38:30.160 --> 38:31.580]  kind of stuff all the time?
[38:31.680 --> 38:32.660]  Is that what you're saying?
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.300]  Jesus Christ.
[38:36.580 --> 38:38.600]  And even if you don't.
[38:40.860 --> 38:42.020]  You can just
[38:42.020 --> 38:43.380]  listen to and watch the show.
[38:43.540 --> 38:46.280]  You need to tell me if you want to listen to this show.
[38:46.460 --> 38:46.860]  You can.
[38:48.120 --> 38:48.320]  Yep.
[38:50.280 --> 38:52.260]  That's what you're trying to tell me.
[38:52.260 --> 38:54.000]  If you can't subscribe to the Patreon
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.420]  and you just want to listen,
[38:55.720 --> 38:57.860]  give it a download. It helps us a little bit more.
[38:58.340 --> 39:00.520]  Yeah, if you download instead of streaming it.
[39:00.620 --> 39:01.760]  We found that out recently.
[39:01.880 --> 39:03.800]  If you download instead of streaming it, it helps us out a little bit more.
[39:04.600 --> 39:06.200]  I just threw my weapon away.
[39:06.960 --> 39:07.900]  Honest to God difference.
[39:08.060 --> 39:08.380]  Oh no.
[39:12.560 --> 39:13.360]  Flying attack.
[39:13.720 --> 39:15.300]  I got you. Out of here.
[39:15.340 --> 39:17.700]  Gorillas are not meant for the ice.
[39:19.520 --> 39:20.480]  Why can't I get out?
[39:20.480 --> 39:22.060]  You don't need to.
[39:23.260 --> 39:26.660]  What a good time to try and...
[39:26.660 --> 39:27.680]  Oh no.
[39:28.220 --> 39:30.680]  I got zapped mid-hit.
[39:33.340 --> 39:35.280]  Other way. Andrew.
[39:36.680 --> 39:37.400]  Andrew.
[39:38.380 --> 39:40.940]  I knocked myself out down the crack.
[39:42.500 --> 39:43.280]  Come on.
[39:44.080 --> 39:44.860]  Get out of there.
[39:44.860 --> 39:45.340]  I'm trying.
[39:48.040 --> 39:49.060]  It's on my face.
[39:53.480 --> 39:54.720]  I'm so stupid.
[39:57.280 --> 39:58.640]  Duck roll. Goose roll.
[39:58.900 --> 39:59.380]  Goose eggs.
[40:01.300 --> 40:02.420]  Oh my God.
[40:04.040 --> 40:05.520]  Goose you son of a bitch.
[40:05.840 --> 40:06.740]  Apply the plunge.
[40:06.880 --> 40:07.660]  Oh shit, I threw it.
[40:08.540 --> 40:09.360]  Oh God.
[40:11.700 --> 40:13.200]  Is that bad ice? Good ice?
[40:13.200 --> 40:14.140]  Which is this ice?
[40:26.980 --> 40:28.760]  It's anyone's game.
[40:29.620 --> 40:31.660]  Here we go.
[40:32.240 --> 40:33.480]  Bunny baby.
[40:37.110 --> 40:39.080]  Gavin, you're my ultimate rival.
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.340]  No, monkey, I have no beef.
[40:44.360 --> 40:46.620]  Oh no.
[40:48.560 --> 40:51.220]  Do you think the ultimate threat is an invisible goose?
[40:55.180 --> 40:56.440]  Did you hit me, Gavin?
[40:57.980 --> 40:59.160]  Gavin, I know it's you.
[40:59.940 --> 41:00.460]  No.
[41:00.980 --> 41:01.780]  No, Geoff.
[41:03.000 --> 41:03.680]  Take that.
[41:05.080 --> 41:06.600]  That's right, I'm Geoff.
[41:07.320 --> 41:08.620]  You figured it out.
[41:11.520 --> 41:13.020]  Why won't it let me hold that?
[41:13.180 --> 41:14.620]  Get up the thing, stupid.
[41:14.880 --> 41:15.520]  Get up!
[41:16.280 --> 41:18.320]  It was me all along.
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.420]  Okay, if I could hit you once.
[41:20.540 --> 41:21.120]  There we go.
[41:21.340 --> 41:24.480]  Get in the fucking sea.
[41:25.960 --> 41:26.180]  Nope.
[41:27.360 --> 41:29.100]  I'll go in the sea if you go with me.
[41:29.680 --> 41:30.760]  No, I don't want to.
[41:31.000 --> 41:31.620]  I don't want to.
[41:31.620 --> 41:32.660]  Gavin, no!
[41:37.460 --> 41:39.020]  I don't want to grab you.
[41:39.840 --> 41:41.300]  God damn it, Geoff.
[41:42.200 --> 41:43.100]  Did you both drown?
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.240]  Now we're like that movie where we're two rocks looking at more rocks.
[41:47.620 --> 41:49.640]  And I'm like, you were a good daughter.
[41:52.820 --> 41:53.920]  You gotta win this.
[41:55.060 --> 41:56.240]  No, let it go.
[41:58.220 --> 41:59.440]  Not in this room.
[41:59.440 --> 42:00.420]  We're hitting a winner here.
[42:01.420 --> 42:02.280]  Come on, Nick.
[42:02.340 --> 42:03.000]  Gavin, let it go.
[42:04.420 --> 42:05.820]  Gavin, let my dick go.
[42:06.440 --> 42:07.920]  Don't let Gavin succeed.
[42:08.300 --> 42:09.760]  Gavin, let my dick go.
[42:10.420 --> 42:15.000]  Oh, that was a banana.
[42:16.000 --> 42:16.820]  Oh shit, I threw it.
[42:17.780 --> 42:18.880]  On my duck beak.
[42:18.940 --> 42:20.260]  It's time to go, ducky.
[42:20.980 --> 42:21.320]  Oh shit.
[42:22.380 --> 42:22.600]  Fuck.
[42:24.280 --> 42:25.400]  What is that?
[42:26.160 --> 42:27.660]  Someone threw a crossbow on my back.
[42:27.660 --> 42:29.860]  Oh shit.
[42:31.600 --> 42:33.480]  No. Get up.
[42:33.880 --> 42:34.440]  Get up.
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.920]  Oh my god.
[42:41.500 --> 42:42.020]  No.
[42:42.140 --> 42:43.100]  Gavin, let me go.
[42:43.220 --> 42:44.340]  It's not gonna work.
[42:44.500 --> 42:45.880]  What is it?
[42:46.120 --> 42:48.000]  Gavin won.
[42:50.000 --> 42:50.800]  Wow.
[42:51.620 --> 42:52.060]  No.
[42:53.460 --> 42:55.100]  He froze a half second later.
[42:55.100 --> 42:56.880]  The frame perfect freeze.
[42:58.460 --> 42:59.260]  Who lost?
[43:03.560 --> 43:05.660]  Podcast, it's me, Geoff. Would've been a great name.
[43:08.360 --> 43:09.480]  Go to pod.
[43:10.820 --> 43:13.260]  Look at how sad of a fucking gorilla I am.
[43:15.200 --> 43:16.720]  I got cut from the new movie.
[43:18.760 --> 43:20.060]  Alright, Eric's back in.
[43:20.540 --> 43:21.760]  I'm in, baby. Who's out?
[43:21.760 --> 43:23.180]  Oh, what is this?
[43:23.380 --> 43:23.960]  I'll go out. I'll sit out.
[43:24.220 --> 43:27.260]  Good, you've been playing since 3am or whatever.
[43:27.680 --> 43:29.000]  Yeah, I'm pretty tired.
[43:31.780 --> 43:32.480]  Oh my god.
[43:33.080 --> 43:35.280]  Fall off the castle and stay alive?
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.100]  I don't think I've played this one.
[43:40.200 --> 43:42.660]  Well, that's what happens when you don't just play the first level over and over.
[43:43.060 --> 43:44.480]  Well, I played when the game came out.
[43:45.280 --> 43:48.540]  Is the podcast only available on Patreon or will it be on YouTube as well?
[43:48.600 --> 43:50.700]  It will definitely be on YouTube as well.
[43:50.700 --> 43:58.060]  But Patreon is where we're going to be communicating all that stuff the most clearly.
[43:58.640 --> 44:01.140]  Also, if you want to add free...
[44:01.140 --> 44:01.720]  Oh, why am I in this?
[44:01.860 --> 44:04.720]  Because you haven't done anything to take yourself out.
[44:06.960 --> 44:08.460]  Why would I want this?
[44:10.140 --> 44:11.480]  Why would I want this?
[44:12.100 --> 44:13.020]  What is this lamp?
[44:13.640 --> 44:15.100]  I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[44:15.460 --> 44:17.460]  Ow, the lamp knocked me out.
[44:18.280 --> 44:19.400]  Oh, it's a knockout lamp.
[44:20.360 --> 44:21.520]  Oh, that's what it is.
[44:21.540 --> 44:22.140]  Gavin, goodbye!
[44:23.960 --> 44:24.320]  Whoa!
[44:27.200 --> 44:27.560]  Wow.
[44:28.760 --> 44:29.720]  Oh, Jesus.
[44:29.880 --> 44:31.220]  I'm coming for you!
[44:31.880 --> 44:33.200]  Will it also be on Spotify?
[44:33.380 --> 44:35.700]  Yeah, it's going to be in all the places it always was.
[44:36.060 --> 44:39.580]  We just can't announce what RSS feed it will be on.
[44:39.700 --> 44:43.840]  The Patreon is for other stuff and a place to keep track of everything.
[44:43.980 --> 44:45.020]  The podcast doesn't change.
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.180]  The podcast will be out on the same day, it will be out on the same time.
[44:47.180 --> 44:49.580]  It will be exactly the same as it was before.
[44:49.600 --> 44:51.400]  And it will be away from no one.
[44:51.600 --> 44:52.860]  I mounted you, Jesus.
[44:54.560 --> 45:00.380]  Eventually, we'll be making all the exact same stuff in the exact same cadence that we were as we ramped up to it.
[45:00.400 --> 45:01.280]  It's just going to take some time.
[45:01.420 --> 45:02.540]  And then, of course, new stuff too.
[45:03.160 --> 45:06.080]  Andrew and I have a new podcast we want to start pretty soon.
[45:06.360 --> 45:07.820]  We got a billion different ideas.
[45:07.980 --> 45:09.620]  We have a whole whiteboard full of ideas.
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.100]  You'll find all those ideas.
[45:13.100 --> 45:14.520]  I hope somebody saved that photo.
[45:14.520 --> 45:15.820]  Of course.
[45:16.180 --> 45:17.680]  On the Patreon or the podcast.
[45:18.420 --> 45:19.680]  Hey, what do you think this does?
[45:20.560 --> 45:22.280]  I don't know, but I don't want to be here.
[45:23.620 --> 45:25.020]  Get up, bunny!
[45:25.900 --> 45:26.180]  Bunny!
[45:27.260 --> 45:28.440]  Greetings from Ohio.
[45:28.900 --> 45:30.160]  Greetings from Austin.
[45:32.520 --> 45:35.200]  Is this the same podcast you tested a few months ago?
[45:35.200 --> 45:35.960]  It is not.
[45:36.180 --> 45:37.120]  We never released that.
[45:38.660 --> 45:39.440]  This is totally different.
[45:40.360 --> 45:42.580]  Okay, I'm in, baby.
[45:43.180 --> 45:45.120]  Is Gavin in a bad mood?
[45:45.220 --> 45:45.600]  Usually.
[45:47.560 --> 45:49.640]  It's unfortunate, but it is what it is.
[45:49.760 --> 45:50.500]  Oh, shit.
[45:50.620 --> 45:51.420]  There goes my boomerang.
[45:53.740 --> 45:55.060]  Come down, Nick.
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.260]  As you know, the Boston Celtics are the official regulation basketball team of the regulation podcast.
[46:00.960 --> 46:01.980]  It's not true.
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.300]  No, I shot you with a stun gun.
[46:08.700 --> 46:09.400]  Go Rockets!
[46:09.400 --> 46:12.060]  Go all the way to Cancun, because you guys have the summer off.
[46:12.100 --> 46:12.580]  Enjoy it.
[46:14.640 --> 46:15.300]  That's funny.
[46:16.220 --> 46:17.800]  You have to be careful, Geoff, saying stuff like that.
[46:17.840 --> 46:19.580]  Pat Bevins is going to throw a basketball at you.
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.040]  Then he'll have to serve another four-game suspension next season.
[46:23.100 --> 46:23.760]  He'll never get to play.
[46:24.220 --> 46:25.660]  I was going to say, I wonder if he...
[46:25.660 --> 46:26.400]  Do you think he'll be back?
[46:27.160 --> 46:29.400]  Yeah, he'll be back, but he got suspended.
[46:31.220 --> 46:32.800]  I think he's still on the team, though.
[46:32.900 --> 46:33.100]  Gavin!
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.200]  I say this lovingly.
[46:35.260 --> 46:37.840]  I would throw a basketball at you, Geoff, for a four-game suspension.
[46:37.840 --> 46:39.880]  I would think that would be a fair trade.
[46:40.520 --> 46:46.020]  If I could get you suspended from an NBA game for four games with my face, I'd do it.
[46:46.960 --> 46:49.740]  How many games did you get suspended when you threw that branch at Gavin?
[46:50.100 --> 46:51.200]  Was that like three games?
[46:51.640 --> 46:53.440]  There's no conclusive proof that I did that.
[46:54.360 --> 46:54.740]  Fire!
[46:55.300 --> 46:59.500]  We also don't know in which timeline I threw it.
[47:00.720 --> 47:02.100]  We traded weapons.
[47:02.100 --> 47:03.220]  We trailed each other there.
[47:04.300 --> 47:04.720]  Fuck.
[47:04.720 --> 47:06.060]  Where did mine go?
[47:06.520 --> 47:08.620]  I think I have it.
[47:08.660 --> 47:09.400]  I think I took your gun.
[47:09.740 --> 47:10.080]  Oh shit!
[47:11.640 --> 47:13.280]  I'm still a fan of Taco Fall.
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.020]  Does anyone know what's happening with the tuxedo from the tuxedo?
[47:19.460 --> 47:20.300]  Probably stuff.
[47:20.920 --> 47:21.200]  Yeah.
[47:22.220 --> 47:25.400]  We're not going to answer every question, but you know.
[47:26.140 --> 47:26.440]  God.
[47:26.760 --> 47:27.240]  Just a few.
[47:28.960 --> 47:29.580]  And if we want to.
[47:30.360 --> 47:30.880]  Up!
[47:30.880 --> 47:31.080]  Up!
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.900]  Now that Rooster Teeth is gone, would this be a good time to ask for the magic of the gathering?
[47:36.160 --> 47:37.300]  Didn't we do that already?
[47:38.140 --> 47:41.740]  I think you did one and then you didn't release one.
[47:42.060 --> 47:43.600]  How is this still going?
[47:43.780 --> 47:44.840]  God, let me up!
[47:44.940 --> 47:45.560]  Let me up!
[47:45.800 --> 47:47.000]  I'm trying to kill him.
[47:48.380 --> 47:50.880]  Does that mean the whole thing is...
[47:52.020 --> 47:52.480]  Whoa!
[47:53.200 --> 47:54.000]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[47:54.480 --> 47:55.120]  You're dead?
[47:55.700 --> 47:57.320]  No, I live forever.
[47:57.320 --> 47:58.720]  Oh my god!
[48:00.520 --> 48:01.100]  Scrap!
[48:01.600 --> 48:02.500]  Who's punch?
[48:03.720 --> 48:04.880]  No power!
[48:05.960 --> 48:06.620]  Now, Gavin!
[48:07.640 --> 48:09.360]  Is the billboard
[48:09.360 --> 48:10.540]  still happening?
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.680]  I mean, I think we would like
[48:13.680 --> 48:14.420]  to get there still.
[48:15.560 --> 48:16.900]  That's the plan,
[48:17.260 --> 48:18.600]  but we have to
[48:19.230 --> 48:20.320]  make money doing this.
[48:21.740 --> 48:23.480]  Honestly, I guess that depends
[48:23.480 --> 48:24.200]  on you, audience.
[48:24.840 --> 48:26.080]  You tell us.
[48:26.380 --> 48:28.140]  Oh, I'm trampling!
[48:29.400 --> 48:30.760]  I'm trampling on your face!
[48:30.840 --> 48:32.080]  This is your favorite question,
[48:32.220 --> 48:34.120]  Eric. Somebody asked, is it Regulation Podcast
[48:34.120 --> 48:35.420]  or VE Regulation Podcast?
[48:35.580 --> 48:37.400]  Go ahead and ask around.
[48:37.700 --> 48:38.460]  See what everyone thinks.
[48:39.340 --> 48:42.040]  Eric's answered definitively.
[48:42.080 --> 48:43.080]  What do these lights do?
[48:43.120 --> 48:44.900]  What I think is that this is about to be a Shark Tales.
[48:45.400 --> 48:47.700]  I'm going to knock everybody out. I'm winning this game.
[48:48.000 --> 48:48.620]  I like this level.
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.120]  This is my home court.
[48:50.120 --> 48:52.420]  Well, yeah, this is what happens when you don't play this game
[48:52.420 --> 48:53.540]  the first level over and over.
[48:53.700 --> 48:55.060]  You find the different ones that you like.
[48:56.320 --> 48:56.720]  Bork!
[48:58.000 --> 48:58.800]  Oh, shit.
[49:00.400 --> 49:02.220]  I feel like there's something with these
[49:02.220 --> 49:03.760]  lights that we just are not understanding.
[49:04.300 --> 49:05.160]  Oh, I totally agree.
[49:07.420 --> 49:08.220]  Oh, shit.
[49:08.580 --> 49:10.200]  Hey, audience, does anybody know what they're
[49:10.200 --> 49:11.160]  dumb about on this level?
[49:12.620 --> 49:13.780]  That's a great question, Geoff.
[49:14.340 --> 49:16.480]  Can you open that with your hand pulled over?
[49:16.600 --> 49:18.140]  Yeah, I feel like there's something in there.
[49:18.140 --> 49:20.000]  A dick came out.
[49:21.020 --> 49:21.940]  Oh, fuck.
[49:22.020 --> 49:23.160]  Of your duck or you?
[49:23.600 --> 49:26.040]  Here's a question I think that
[49:26.040 --> 49:26.860]  deserves answering.
[49:27.460 --> 49:30.020]  That Daydreamer said, has Gavin gotten over his
[49:30.020 --> 49:30.540]  foot finish?
[49:30.840 --> 49:31.300]  No.
[49:33.680 --> 49:35.360]  He's still hard for him.
[49:35.860 --> 49:38.240]  I saw a guy with sandals this morning
[49:38.240 --> 49:39.440]  and it was...
[49:39.900 --> 49:41.240]  Your dick exploded, right?
[49:44.460 --> 49:45.980]  Hey, Gavin, come help me get rid of him.
[49:46.640 --> 49:47.000]  Okay.
[49:48.440 --> 49:50.240]  Looks like that door in the Achievement Hunter.
[49:50.320 --> 49:51.560]  Oh, shit. Sorry, Gavin.
[49:52.740 --> 49:53.640]  The paint one?
[49:54.080 --> 49:54.860]  Yeah, the paint one.
[49:55.520 --> 49:56.300]  We got that door.
[49:58.420 --> 50:00.120]  We picked it up at a U-Haul yesterday.
[50:00.440 --> 50:00.540]  Yeah.
[50:01.440 --> 50:03.640]  It may have got slightly squashed by a poor potty.
[50:06.320 --> 50:07.340]  The lights are off.
[50:07.900 --> 50:09.480]  Are we still in our cum area?
[50:09.640 --> 50:11.680]  Well, it depends on how many feet Gavin sees in a day.
[50:11.860 --> 50:12.460]  Yeah, no kidding.
[50:13.820 --> 50:14.440]  Piss rat!
[50:14.620 --> 50:14.960]  Piss rat!
[50:18.280 --> 50:20.020]  I do this for all of us!
[50:20.180 --> 50:20.700]  Oh, I missed.
[50:25.180 --> 50:26.900]  There was a bomb!
[50:27.160 --> 50:28.300]  Gavin, I died for you.
[50:28.340 --> 50:29.340]  I want you to remember that shit.
[50:29.580 --> 50:30.020]  Thank you.
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.400]  Yeah, Gracie got a real job. She got a real-ass grown-up job.
[50:34.820 --> 50:35.420]  But we're...
[50:35.420 --> 50:38.020]  We're about doing some stuff and everything.
[50:38.940 --> 50:40.060]  It's a timing thing.
[50:40.060 --> 50:42.240]  She's in the slack.
[50:42.320 --> 50:43.020]  She's invited.
[50:43.420 --> 50:45.240]  I invited her to be part of the stream.
[50:45.460 --> 50:46.560]  But she's unfortunately busy.
[50:48.240 --> 50:51.260]  We answer a lot of these questions in our first episode.
[50:51.800 --> 50:52.360]  That's true too.
[50:52.780 --> 50:54.820]  So if you missed a lot of this, don't worry about it.
[50:55.080 --> 50:57.920]  Gracie said she was busy today doing anything else.
[50:58.420 --> 51:00.020]  Yeah, and she kept saying it.
[51:00.100 --> 51:01.780]  And it was like, you don't have to repeat it.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.500]  Yeah, she kept changing it.
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.060]  I wasn't sure what was up with that.
[51:10.360 --> 51:12.760]  I'm trying to figure out if there's something.
[51:12.900 --> 51:14.300]  Get away from me, stupid fucking rabbit!
[51:14.600 --> 51:15.600]  I'm trying to figure out this door.
[51:16.540 --> 51:17.860]  What sound does a rabbit make?
[51:19.020 --> 51:20.040]  Go ahead, you tell me, Nick.
[51:20.920 --> 51:21.320]  Uh...
[51:21.320 --> 51:23.100]  I don't know.
[51:23.960 --> 51:26.140]  It's like a sort of a...
[51:26.140 --> 51:27.000]  What's up, doc?
[51:27.420 --> 51:27.680]  Yeah.
[51:28.260 --> 51:32.180]  Ah, you caught my racket.
[51:34.060 --> 51:34.460]  What?!
[51:34.460 --> 51:36.500]  God, I wish you guys would fucking finish.
[51:37.080 --> 51:38.420]  Are you excited to play again?
[51:38.840 --> 51:40.300]  No, I'm just excited for this one.
[51:40.620 --> 51:40.640]  No!
[51:42.860 --> 51:44.720]  Get off my freaking feathers!
[51:45.540 --> 51:45.720]  No.
[51:46.380 --> 51:47.400]  Oh, we knocked each other out.
[51:47.940 --> 51:49.280]  I'm trying. Oh, no.
[51:50.940 --> 51:51.740]  Uh-oh.
[51:52.840 --> 51:53.720]  I'm so dumb.
[51:54.240 --> 51:55.740]  Why do I keep throwing it?
[51:55.920 --> 51:56.820]  God damn it.
[51:57.020 --> 51:59.740]  I feel like if you don't pick it up by the proper handle, it throws.
[52:00.200 --> 52:00.940]  Yeah, it just...
[52:02.820 --> 52:03.620]  Uh-oh.
[52:03.780 --> 52:03.960]  Uh-oh.
[52:03.960 --> 52:04.980]  Uh-oh.
[52:05.740 --> 52:07.660]  No, the level's falling.
[52:07.900 --> 52:08.680]  Oh, get me up.
[52:09.360 --> 52:11.340]  You have to kill Andrew or it's over.
[52:12.380 --> 52:13.680]  Will there be other games today?
[52:13.800 --> 52:15.540]  Yeah, we're playing something after...
[52:15.540 --> 52:17.140]  We're going to play two more games after this, I think.
[52:17.740 --> 52:20.200]  We're going to do... I think we're going to do Worms next.
[52:20.540 --> 52:22.000]  I've already typed in my names.
[52:22.860 --> 52:24.200]  I didn't think about it.
[52:24.460 --> 52:25.820]  Oh, good. Gavin, please...
[52:25.820 --> 52:26.580]  I'll observe.
[52:29.420 --> 52:31.000]  I think you're around here, Nick.
[52:31.320 --> 52:31.800]  I'm dead.
[52:31.800 --> 52:33.200]  What the fuck?
[52:33.840 --> 52:34.820]  Oh, my God.
[52:35.900 --> 52:36.860]  Where's the...
[52:36.860 --> 52:38.820]  I've been dead as dicks, dude.
[52:39.820 --> 52:40.760]  Who are you?
[52:41.420 --> 52:42.280]  Who are you?
[52:42.940 --> 52:43.580]  Who are you?
[52:45.340 --> 52:46.620]  Oh, no.
[52:48.000 --> 52:48.320]  Yeah.
[52:48.880 --> 52:49.240]  Yeah.
[52:50.100 --> 52:50.740]  No!
[52:54.240 --> 52:55.220]  Shark tail!
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.620]  I thought you were going to say shark tank.
[52:57.620 --> 52:58.020]  What?
[53:00.620 --> 53:00.980]  Wait.
[53:01.080 --> 53:03.020]  Are you guys going to play games until Sloppy Joe's?
[53:03.060 --> 53:05.000]  Now, we're going to stop at like three or four
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.780]  and then we'll take a couple of hours to shit
[53:06.780 --> 53:08.460]  and take a nap.
[53:08.480 --> 53:10.440]  I've been streaming since 8 a.m., so...
[53:10.440 --> 53:14.540]  Eric, he's got his official piss rat duties to do.
[53:14.860 --> 53:16.020]  Yeah, sure, I got to piss, baby.
[53:16.040 --> 53:17.560]  We'll be back for Sloppy Joe's.
[53:17.580 --> 53:18.460]  I got to piss rat style, you know.
[53:18.460 --> 53:20.380]  It's going to be a sloppy Saturday night.
[53:20.540 --> 53:22.940]  And man, let me tell you, what I want to work into...
[53:22.940 --> 53:25.580]  I found this new video feed
[53:25.580 --> 53:27.420]  outside of a strip club in Thailand.
[53:27.880 --> 53:29.360]  And you would think it's about the strip club,
[53:29.440 --> 53:31.300]  but it's not. It's about this hole in the ground
[53:31.300 --> 53:32.680]  that people fall into sometimes.
[53:32.880 --> 53:35.240]  I've really been enjoying that. I want to work out a way
[53:35.240 --> 53:36.500]  to do some bingo there, too, maybe.
[53:36.740 --> 53:38.680]  We're really escalating from a bar in Florida
[53:38.680 --> 53:40.500]  to a strip club in Thailand.
[53:42.100 --> 53:43.400]  Doesn't have anything to do with the strip club,
[53:43.460 --> 53:45.320]  except that it distracts people, so they fall into the hole.
[53:45.840 --> 53:47.120]  Alright, I'm going to spectate this time.
[53:48.220 --> 53:48.420]  Okay.
[53:48.420 --> 53:48.500]  What?
[53:48.500 --> 53:49.020]  What do you mean?
[53:49.100 --> 53:54.180]  What are you talking about?
[53:54.180 --> 53:56.020]  Did you leave the whole game?
[53:56.420 --> 53:57.200]  I guess I did, yeah.
[53:57.720 --> 53:58.880]  What do you mean you guess?
[53:59.040 --> 54:01.180]  You said to leave the game, so I left the game.
[54:01.640 --> 54:02.720]  Who said leave the game?
[54:03.080 --> 54:05.940]  I said, why am I playing? And you said, because you haven't left yet.
[54:05.980 --> 54:06.780]  So I left.
[54:08.020 --> 54:08.300]  What?
[54:09.660 --> 54:11.480]  I was in the game, and I said, why am I in the game?
[54:11.520 --> 54:14.060]  I thought I was sitting this game out, and then somebody said, it's because you haven't left yet.
[54:14.180 --> 54:15.600]  And I said, oh, okay, and so I left.
[54:15.600 --> 54:16.600]  I'm real stuck.
[54:16.940 --> 54:18.740]  What an insane way to do that.
[54:19.960 --> 54:20.380]  To leave?
[54:21.300 --> 54:24.380]  Yes, you go to lobby options, and it's right there.
[54:24.760 --> 54:25.440]  Did someone invite Geoff?
[54:27.500 --> 54:28.160]  Can you?
[54:28.280 --> 54:29.000]  Oh, you're not friends with him.
[54:29.940 --> 54:31.120]  Next one who dies, invite him.
[54:31.380 --> 54:32.660]  No! Holy shit!
[54:34.680 --> 54:36.860]  Oh, wow.
[54:37.100 --> 54:39.220]  You killed the hell out of us there.
[54:40.340 --> 54:41.500]  What? Wait, did I win?
[54:41.780 --> 54:42.340]  No, I did.
[54:44.040 --> 54:45.680]  Let me see if I can invite you, Geoff.
[54:45.800 --> 54:47.360]  Yeah, this FUD will be uploaded.
[54:48.200 --> 54:49.220]  Yeah, we'll upload it.
[54:49.580 --> 54:50.180]  There you go, Geoff.
[54:51.720 --> 54:52.300]  Thank you.
[54:52.580 --> 54:54.340]  I'm putting a lot of these streams on YouTube.
[54:55.740 --> 54:56.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:57.960 --> 55:00.700]  The thing about this Twitch channel
[55:00.700 --> 55:01.340]  is that
[55:01.340 --> 55:03.360]  probably anything that happens here,
[55:04.020 --> 55:05.420]  except maybe sloppy joes?
[55:05.460 --> 55:05.840]  I'm not sure.
[55:06.180 --> 55:07.540]  But most of the stuff that will happen here
[55:07.540 --> 55:09.740]  will be on our YouTube channel later.
[55:10.560 --> 55:11.820]  Yeah, we're going to do some
[55:11.820 --> 55:13.980]  Patreon only streams with sloppy joes and stuff.
[55:14.240 --> 55:14.420]  Yeah.
[55:15.160 --> 55:15.760]  Uh oh.
[55:17.900 --> 55:18.860]  Geoff, did you get in?
[55:19.960 --> 55:20.440]  Uh, yeah.
[55:20.880 --> 55:23.760]  Is it Gavin?
[55:24.000 --> 55:24.360]  My dad?
[55:26.180 --> 55:27.740]  Why am I stuck?
[55:28.820 --> 55:29.880]  I don't want this.
[55:30.380 --> 55:31.020]  You know what I want?
[55:31.680 --> 55:32.760]  I want to eat.
[55:34.600 --> 55:35.580]  I got some fish.
[55:35.900 --> 55:37.800]  Got some fish going over here.
[55:38.540 --> 55:39.580]  Nice and toasty.
[55:40.680 --> 55:41.920]  Nice and cooked.
[55:42.040 --> 55:42.820]  Can I use this?
[55:43.640 --> 55:44.600]  Oh man.
[55:45.180 --> 55:46.300]  This is going to be delicious.
[55:47.100 --> 55:48.380]  That was rude.
[55:48.800 --> 55:50.240]  That was so rude.
[55:51.340 --> 55:52.140]  Let me up.
[55:52.500 --> 55:54.380]  I got beef now with that cat.
[55:54.560 --> 55:55.220]  Get over here.
[55:55.620 --> 55:57.940]  Somebody asked if we ever cooked beans in the second bean hole.
[55:58.100 --> 55:59.880]  I can answer that in a couple weeks.
[56:01.660 --> 56:03.360]  Give me a month and I'll answer that question.
[56:03.820 --> 56:03.940]  Yep.
[56:03.940 --> 56:06.160]  Oh my god.
[56:06.300 --> 56:06.580]  We froze.
[56:07.580 --> 56:08.320]  We sure did.
[56:09.500 --> 56:11.720]  Well, that's a valuable lesson.
[56:12.420 --> 56:13.680]  Cat wins, baby!
[56:14.960 --> 56:16.320]  Is the regulation
[56:16.320 --> 56:17.900]  cookbook still gonna
[56:17.900 --> 56:19.300]  be digitized?
[56:20.360 --> 56:21.960]  I will have an update
[56:21.960 --> 56:22.740]  about that tomorrow.
[56:23.460 --> 56:23.960]  There you go.
[56:25.540 --> 56:27.720]  That's either a yes or a no.
[56:28.180 --> 56:29.120]  We just don't know yet.
[56:29.760 --> 56:31.960]  We're working hard to get it all.
[56:33.360 --> 56:34.080]  We're hoping
[56:34.620 --> 56:35.880]  that you'll be able to enjoy
[56:35.880 --> 56:37.320]  everything you've previously enjoyed
[56:37.320 --> 56:38.840]  in some fashion.
[56:39.140 --> 56:40.880]  Or that you haven't been able to get.
[56:42.020 --> 56:43.180]  Maybe that you weren't able to get.
[56:43.440 --> 56:44.340]  You'll be able to get someday.
[56:46.420 --> 56:47.000]  Oh boy.
[56:50.880 --> 56:52.140]  Geoff, did you realize you were playing
[56:52.140 --> 56:52.480]  or no?
[56:52.940 --> 56:54.000]  Oh no, I was just talking.
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.300]  Oh, right on him.
[56:56.000 --> 56:56.500]  Pretty cool.
[56:58.500 --> 57:00.560]  Oh, come on.
[57:02.440 --> 57:03.600]  Dude, I'll be honest.
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.140]  I played all last night. I'm fine.
[57:05.300 --> 57:06.020]  I'm just happy to hang out.
[57:06.020 --> 57:06.920]  I did it again!
[57:09.800 --> 57:11.620]  That's what I want in a competitive game stream.
[57:12.100 --> 57:14.060]  Oh, I'm super competitive
[57:14.060 --> 57:15.700]  in gaming, so you gotta watch out.
[57:16.060 --> 57:17.920]  So when I said, Geoff, did you get it? And you said yes.
[57:17.920 --> 57:19.800]  And I said, nice. You've just been
[57:19.800 --> 57:20.820]  standing still since then?
[57:21.900 --> 57:22.940]  Yeah, I guess so.
[57:23.160 --> 57:23.780]  He was talking.
[57:24.420 --> 57:26.740]  Yeah, I talked.
[57:27.180 --> 57:27.680]  Yeah, he was talking.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.040]  It's not like you didn't hear me talk.
[57:29.160 --> 57:30.160]  Yeah, he's got a point.
[57:32.220 --> 57:33.920]  Talking is one of the things people do.
[57:34.700 --> 57:35.340]  When they get in a game.
[57:35.420 --> 57:37.020]  You sound like Andrew. I'm just letting you know.
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.860]  Until you start your vow of silence.
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.160]  Can you hold off on that
[57:42.160 --> 57:43.300]  for a couple years, maybe?
[57:45.440 --> 57:46.700]  He just pummeled me
[57:46.700 --> 57:47.460]  to death on the floor.
[57:47.460 --> 57:49.040]  Yeah, I'm trying to beat the shit out of you guys.
[57:50.240 --> 57:51.300]  That is the goal.
[57:52.280 --> 57:53.380]  Maybe we should once a year
[57:53.380 --> 57:55.480]  roll a skulls dice, and it just
[57:55.480 --> 57:57.580]  puts on like a handicap for the entire year.
[57:59.580 --> 58:01.480]  No. Someone could roll the
[58:01.480 --> 58:03.360]  vow of silence dice, and then that's it for the year.
[58:03.740 --> 58:04.140]  Why?
[58:05.460 --> 58:06.780]  Why would we do that?
[58:07.320 --> 58:07.840]  Make it harder?
[58:12.720 --> 58:13.740]  Jump and kick!
[58:14.700 --> 58:15.680]  Jump and kick!
[58:15.860 --> 58:16.340]  No, stop!
[58:17.080 --> 58:17.780]  How do I do that?
[58:19.960 --> 58:21.300]  Left trigger and A.
[58:21.600 --> 58:22.100]  Oh, there we go.
[58:22.800 --> 58:23.980]  Left trigger, Y and A.
[58:24.200 --> 58:25.000]  There we go.
[58:27.380 --> 58:28.280]  No, the cold!
[58:30.260 --> 58:31.520]  Oh, I was born in the cold.
[58:31.720 --> 58:32.520]  Bunnies don't like cold.
[58:34.400 --> 58:35.160]  Molded by it.
[58:36.240 --> 58:37.460]  Oh, I leapt over that.
[58:38.840 --> 58:39.600]  Oh, shit.
[58:39.800 --> 58:40.700]  Okay, I gotta get out of the cold.
[58:40.700 --> 58:41.580]  That was too cold.
[58:43.060 --> 58:44.260]  Yeah, mold that.
[58:44.860 --> 58:46.660]  Mold that as he throws me in the cold.
[58:46.660 --> 58:48.500]  No, Eric! Eric, the two of us will die!
[58:49.480 --> 58:50.440]  Ah! No!
[58:51.360 --> 58:52.740]  Unfreeze me! Unfreeze me!
[58:53.020 --> 58:53.580]  I'm on the fire!
[58:53.900 --> 58:55.320]  That was crazy!
[58:57.180 --> 58:58.140]  Jesus Christ!
[58:58.360 --> 59:00.440]  Where did you come from? Ah, from hell!
[59:01.540 --> 59:02.020]  No!
[59:02.400 --> 59:04.580]  I almost froze, and now you die!
[59:05.540 --> 59:05.940]  No!
[59:05.940 --> 59:06.140]  Ah!
[59:07.920 --> 59:08.480]  What?
[59:09.200 --> 59:11.740]  The heat gives me warmth and energy!
[59:12.400 --> 59:12.960]  You!
[59:13.580 --> 59:14.560]  Nowhere to go!
[59:15.700 --> 59:16.720]  Nowhere to go!
[59:18.180 --> 59:19.700]  There's the bomb right there!
[59:19.860 --> 59:21.480]  Oh, what a kick!
[59:21.920 --> 59:24.100]  Ooh, a live one.
[59:24.840 --> 59:25.200]  Hey, Andrew.
[59:25.760 --> 59:27.180]  Oh, God! Get away from the bomb!
[59:27.240 --> 59:27.400]  Ah!
[59:31.080 --> 59:31.640]  You!
[59:31.960 --> 59:33.060]  Oh, my God!
[59:33.060 --> 59:34.180]  Ooh, a live one.
[59:34.580 --> 59:35.500]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[59:36.580 --> 59:38.120]  Oh, my God!
[59:38.720 --> 59:40.280]  No! No, Nick!
[59:40.500 --> 59:41.920]  Goodbye, my friend. I'm going to burn.
[59:41.920 --> 59:43.100]  You unalive him.
[59:45.500 --> 59:47.640]  Nick is unstoppable in this level.
[59:48.440 --> 59:49.920]  I thrive in the cold.
[59:52.040 --> 59:52.640]  You should look delicious.
[59:52.640 --> 59:53.260]  I'll swap out.
[59:54.660 --> 59:56.100]  I think we should play a different game.
[59:57.140 --> 59:57.820]  You want to swap out games?
[59:58.920 --> 59:59.380]  Yeah!
[59:59.380 --> 59:59.540]  Yeah!
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:01.880]  Okay.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:03.400]  Let's go to Worms.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.560]  Fuck this game.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.420]  Oh, you don't let it in yet?
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.520]  Nope. This is an original Xbox.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.400]  He's loading it now.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:18.600]  Guys, we're still about 498,000 viewers short here.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.420]  That's fine.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.120]  Let's just keep going.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.580]  Oh, am I starting this?
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:23.220]  Oh, this is...
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.280]  You got this, bud!
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.560]  You're the Worms guy.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.560]  Glog-a-chundler?
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.940]  Oh, that's Glog-a-chundler and Bilge-slunt.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.040]  Oh, you smashed Glog-a-chundler down to the ground.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.760]  Take that, Glog-a-chun!
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.080]  You de-glogged him.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:40.740]  I did.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.770]  We got Nick, Gavin...
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:44.440]  Okay.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.900]  Oh, McCord...
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.720]  R-W...
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.700]  What is going on?
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.760]  It's Regulation Worms.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.080]  R-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.000]  Oh, that's right.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.800]  I forgot that that's what you do here.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.420]  Okay, let's see this.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.560]  Uh, you know, just about...
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.720]  Oh, I lost one of my names!
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.180]  Where is he going? In the fucking ocean probably.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:07.940]  Nah.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.500]  Alright, let's go shopping.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.180]  Weeee!
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.260]  Hey, that's you, don't touch him.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:15.940]  Oh, that is me.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.280]  No don't... I shouldn't have said anything.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.280]  What if I was to land... right here...
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.300]  and get on this handy thing?
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.920]  You're gonna take out Gavin?
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:30.460]  Wow.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.240]  Oh, Gavin, no!
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.840]  How do you shoot? Oh, there we go.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.680]  Next time we have a business decision, I'm gonna be thinking about that.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.820]  This is how you feel about yourself.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.700]  Oh, God, look out below!
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.680]  Oh, my God!
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.520]  Oh, my Lord.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.820]  That was a lot of damage.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.280]  84 damage? Holy shit!
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.960]  I took less damage than you did!
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.700]  That name that got blurred out, that was Milfhazard.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.040]  I can't believe that got blurred.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.140]  Damn it.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.520]  Can I...
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.380]  I'm getting this.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.200]  How does this work?
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.340]  I don't think I've ever used a mortar before.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.300]  Honestly, I believe in you.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.940]  I think you just go crazy mode with this.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.080]  Just make sure you give it enough beans.
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:22.060]  Just remember to hold the button down long enough so it charges, probably.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.360]  Yeah, make sure you're doing beans.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.640]  Oh, you can see what you're shooting?
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.300]  Yeah, I'm just zooming out all the way.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.680]  Well, you shot Regulation Worm.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.420]  And I'll do it again.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.480]  I like how many worms could exist before you hit the maximum amount.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:41.980]  Slow drop down.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:42.600]  Alright, where are we going next?
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.560]  Ah, there we are.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.720]  I would not recommend the mortar.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.120]  But the artillery can have like a hundred trillion worms.
[01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.150]  Look at my inventory.
[01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:56.670]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't shoot Gavin.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:00.800]  Am...
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.440]  McCord...
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.340]  Joan...
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.020]  How do I put this fucking thing down?
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.000]  I missed my cheat sheet, team.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.180]  I don't remember the controls.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.840]  Oh.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.440]  No!
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.040]  He's gonna shoot the moon.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.300]  How do I drop this stupid sentry?
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.020]  X?
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060]  Is it not X?
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:24.500]  No!
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.820]  You hit Gavin's mouth.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.180]  Oh my god.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.480]  You might be so in it, it won't shoot you.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.100]  Yeah, maybe, but Joan's fucked.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.720]  Until Joan does something, then it's gonna kill all of us.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.380]  Not Joan.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.840]  It's Andrew.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.600]  A.K.A. Nick.
[01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:54.410]  I mean, it would be dumb if you attacked one of Andrew's actual people as Andrew.
[01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.710]  I think you should clearly go for Regulation Worm 3.
[01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:58.090]  That's not his name.
[01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:00.050]  Why'd you put it there?
[01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.230]  I forgot.
[01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:02.770]  Aaaah!
[01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:08.850]  Regulation Worm 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3.
[01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.730]  What did I tell you about me and worms?
[01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:13.490]  Geoff just got 4 bar codes.
[01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.010]  Let's see son.
[01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.070]  Oh, there's hieroglyphs.
[01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.290]  What are you doing?
[01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.070]  Where are you gonna send that?
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.610]  Oh! Oh, it's a rope sheet.
[01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:33.050]  Do you control the rope?
[01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:35.050]  Yeah, but not well.
[01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.170]  Well, not well.
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.010]  Why isn't it... oh, there we go.
[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:40.270]  You got it, you got it.
[01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:41.570]  Holy shit.
[01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:44.050]  I don't understand how you're so good at it.
[01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.570]  Let him drop.
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:47.470]  You might want to...
[01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:49.870]  I was trying to get it up to knit.
[01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.450]  I mean, we all assume that.
[01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:54.450]  Sat in silence waiting for doom.
[01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:57.330]  Can I move?
[01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:58.450]  Or is this the trap?
[01:04:58.450 --> 01:05:00.610]  All this and we do a podcast?
[01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.910]  Wow.
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.950]  How did you guys feel about recording episode one?
[01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.450]  Did you enjoy it? I loved it.
[01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.250]  I thought it was really good.
[01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.610]  It was a little weird beginning, but so was episode one of Fuckface.
[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:16.130]  But once we got going, we were going.
[01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.850]  I mean, I'll just do that, I guess.
[01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:20.210]  I don't know.
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.370]  Yeah, kill Andrew.
[01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.270]  Yeah, fuck that guy.
[01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:27.430]  Yeah, episode one had some nice energy, I thought.
[01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.530]  Definitely.
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.830]  I thought that was cool.
[01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.090]  Some clips.
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:32.750]  Some scenarios.
[01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:36.110]  Oh my goodness, the scenarios.
[01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:40.550]  Regulation Worm 7.
[01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:42.090]  What do I want to do?
[01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:44.390]  What does this do?
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:51.830]  Let's see what this does.
[01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:54.530]  What are you pondering?
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:55.150]  What the hell am I doing?
[01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:57.710]  Oh no, I hate these.
[01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.270]  Oh, that's what that is.
[01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.910]  Is this a wait until next term?
[01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:03.330]  Yeah.
[01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.610]  I'm going to kill you in the future.
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:12.070]  I'm going to drop a stick on you
[01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.110]  when you least expect it.
[01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:14.670]  Oh, it's me.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.260]  Geoff, has there been any update on Anma?
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.160]  Yeah.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.300]  We have an internal update.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.580]  What the?
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:27.620]  What happened?
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.160]  We're still working on it.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.800]  It's not as high a priority.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.040]  It'll be back.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.740]  Oh, I forgot about the missile.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.180]  Oh no!
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:38.880]  No!
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.000]  It's not a secretariat!
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.240]  No secretariat!
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:46.580]  Wow, that worked out well for me.
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:49.860]  No secretariat!
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.400]  I did it!
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.460]  It's exactly what Nick landed.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.360]  Crazy.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.280]  And it was on a character named Geoff.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.060]  Come on, Geoff.
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:00.200]  What are you going to do, man?
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.420]  Wink! Dynamo!
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.200]  Okay, is A jump or is X jump?
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.860]  A is jump.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.780]  X is drop or throw.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.480]  I think Y gets into stuff, maybe.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.460]  Okay.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.040]  Where are all the people at?
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.300]  Oh no.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.480]  Hey, catch this!
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:28.960]  No!
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:29.660]  Oh shit!
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.480]  No, get away!
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.420]  Just me? Really?
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.940]  That's awesome.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:38.900]  That's so cool.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.400]  1% health!
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.460]  Motherfucker.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.760]  You just created a new...
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.560]  You just created the new Joker, motherfucker.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.080]  You see, you called me motherfucker because it's clearly not where I was aiming.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.080]  You just created the new Joker.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.580]  I mean, I might as well get in on this.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.560]  What? On what? No.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.400]  On the whole hand grenade.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:02.460]  Oh no!
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.560]  Oh shit!
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.640]  Definitely going to send that...
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:08.920]  Yeah.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.120]  That's definitely going to kill me.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.700]  There's no way that's 60 damage.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.280]  How much damage?
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.420]  Vehicle mine on my head down there.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.320]  Damn it.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.460]  Nilfhazard needs some health.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:27.220]  Nilfhazard has all the luck.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:29.900]  I love...
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.200]  It looks like so much shit has happened around this singular worm.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.620]  And no damage has happened.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.700]  No, don't do it!
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.280]  Geoff, it's you!
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.460]  I know.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.140]  This is how I feel about me, though.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.060]  You're the idiot that named me me.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.500]  You should have known I'd be my own first target.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.340]  He's still alive.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.440]  And you got health up there.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.560]  So don't be a little bitch.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:00.660]  Nevermind.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.520]  That's the best timing ever!
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.780]  Oh, God.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.080]  Permission to be a little bitch now.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.460]  Yeah, you're good now.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.120]  I forgot!
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.040]  No!
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.020]  Not again!
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.620]  You guys are crazy.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.500]  This is so awesome.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.820]  5%?
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:40.000]  All of that for 5% damage?
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.600]  Oh, man.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.420]  Maximum flair, though.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.800]  Oh, man.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.180]  Oh, that rolls.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.980]  Nick's just getting railed.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.080]  Alright, Milfhazard is pissed.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.380]  Oh, come on, Milfhazard.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.820]  How about a deal with yourself here?
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:57.580]  No!
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.700]  Come on, let's think about this, Milfhazard.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.920]  Who are we coming on?
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.640]  Everybody, take your socks off.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.640]  Gavin's feeling it.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.100]  Ooh, look at these arches.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:13.940]  Are you freaking out?
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.780]  No, no, no, don't cut your toenail.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:17.320]  What are you talking about?
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:19.620]  Damn me.
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:20.960]  Damn it.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.620]  Oh, Nick, I'm sorry, Nick.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.860]  We were referencing Gavin wanting to jack off on our feet.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.840]  Oh, no, I was talking to Eric specifically.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:31.940]  We got into a whole flip thing on 100% heat.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:32.880]  Yes!
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.100]  Yes!
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.980]  Gavin, how did we...
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.680]  Oh, how, how? How did we do it?
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.260]  I forgot.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.420]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.660]  That turrets MVP in this game so far.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.640]  Oh, no!
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.300]  Oh, no!
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.540]  I think there's only one thing I can do.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:03.660]  Put a girder, put a girder.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.280]  Uh-oh.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:08.940]  That's not good for me.
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:09.580]  Oh, no!
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:10.540]  Oh, God!
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:13.940]  Oh, stink!
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.980]  Oh, get the other one.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.920]  Get the other one.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:19.900]  They're fine.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.660]  They both have one.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.700]  Well, there goes the turret.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.120]  They both have one.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.440]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.800]  And more health coming down.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.480]  No good for me.
[01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.250]  Ah, damn.
[01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:45.570]  What you doing?
[01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:47.030]  What's the thought process here?
[01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.950]  What do you think I'm doing?
[01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:50.050]  Oh, damn it.
[01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:51.230]  Going into hiding?
[01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:52.150]  Yeah.
[01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:55.870]  Got one health.
[01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:57.410]  Gotta make it last.
[01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.670]  All right.
[01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:01.870]  See ya.
[01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:03.950]  They both have one health. It's crazy.
[01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:04.670]  That's nuts.
[01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:06.730]  Yeah, it's crazy nuts.
[01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:12.730]  Just crazy nuts.
[01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.830]  Crazy nuts feels like a 90s snack food.
[01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.070]  Zany wrapping.
[01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:19.930]  Like Carmen Electra sold.
[01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.630]  Yeah.
[01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.390]  No, that's more of a Jenny McCarthy product, crazy nuts.
[01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:25.710]  No, get out of there.
[01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:27.430]  Right after she finished her Xbox.
[01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.450]  What are you doing?
[01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:33.550]  It's a load with flavor.
[01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:34.370]  What are you doing?
[01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.690]  Well, I'm just stood.
[01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:37.770]  Hmm.
[01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.150]  I feel like...
[01:12:41.150 --> 01:12:41.410]  Ah!
[01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:43.530]  My God.
[01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:45.670]  That was the way to do that.
[01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:51.110]  I may have hit the button a couple times too fast.
[01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:54.690]  Oh, geez.
[01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:58.550]  Well...
[01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:00.830]  Sorry, Gavin.
[01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.610]  And me.
[01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.650]  I should croft.
[01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.890]  That is...
[01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:06.610]  Yeah, I need to start doing that as well.
[01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:08.390]  You guys haven't been crafting?
[01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:09.870]  No, not at all.
[01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.330]  I keep forgetting.
[01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:13.650]  Is it my turn?
[01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:14.610]  No.
[01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:18.310]  I was looking at...
[01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:19.390]  I was looking at our slack.
[01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:21.970]  I'm a busy businessman.
[01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:23.210]  Oh!
[01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:26.770]  That's amazing.
[01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:31.330]  That was very cool, Gavin.
[01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:34.310]  Ah, shit.
[01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:36.770]  Love that.
[01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:37.150]  Wow.
[01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:41.010]  I thought they would split apart a bit lower down.
[01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:42.630]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:43.810]  Wow.
[01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:48.490]  Wait, does that mean I'm dead?
[01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:50.590]  No, no.
[01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.370]  You still have Andrew.
[01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.370]  Let's get crafting, my son.
[01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:00.590]  No, no.
[01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:01.130]  No!
[01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:12.010]  Video games are dumb.
[01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:14.750]  How does this game
[01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.350]  continue to provide
[01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.670]  that shit?
[01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:20.370]  Jesus fucking
[01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:21.730]  Christ.
[01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:24.710]  That was insane.
[01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:26.990]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.150]  I love that.
[01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:30.930]  Oh, this is the best
[01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:32.070]  fucking thing ever.
[01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:34.750]  Just ever.
[01:14:35.210 --> 01:14:35.530]  Uh-oh.
[01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:37.130]  Oh, not this shit again.
[01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.990]  I only
[01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:41.270]  want to fight in the future.
[01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.990]  All turrets and future bombs for me.
[01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:47.630]  Drones.
[01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:51.750]  Who's sick?
[01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:52.770]  Is that Joan that's sick?
[01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:56.310]  Uh...
[01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.950]  I think so.
[01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:57.330]  Is it?
[01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.530]  Yeah, I think it is.
[01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.510]  Yeah.
[01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.830]  Uh, yeah.
[01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:06.790]  Oh, that's where he is.
[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:08.310]  Uh...
[01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:10.370]  Go get him, Nick!
[01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:12.370]  What do I want?
[01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.950]  Oh, no.
[01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.730]  Go get him!
[01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:16.750]  Nah, I'm doing that.
[01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:21.350]  Here's an interesting
[01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:22.790]  situation.
[01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:29.230]  Hmm...
[01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:29.670]  He's the
[01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:30.010]  thinking.
[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:33.610]  When has that ever helped you in this?
[01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:35.510]  A lot of people don't realize it, but Nick's a big
[01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:36.010]  thinker.
[01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:39.470]  Nick seems to be going for
[01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:40.310]  my team a lot.
[01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:43.570]  He remembers that for business
[01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.410]  decisions, you know what I mean?
[01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:46.570]  Did that help?
[01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:48.050]  Did that push him out of the way?
[01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:49.210]  No, it sure didn't.
[01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:52.730]  Jungler!
[01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:54.590]  Give Joan a minute!
[01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:56.610]  She's already sick!
[01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.450]  Not for much longer.
[01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:01.290]  To be fair to me, I initiated that attack forever
[01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.750]  ago. I didn't know Nick was going to do that.
[01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:03.430]  Yeah!
[01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:05.850]  Squink! Dynamo!
[01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:09.130]  No!
[01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:10.090]  Oops!
[01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.410]  Oh!
[01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:14.330]  Nice.
[01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.230]  Squink Dynamo!
[01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.510]  All right.
[01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:20.650]  In the last round...
[01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.090]  Who's near the edge?
[01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:23.190]  Not me.
[01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:25.250]  Okay.
[01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:26.310]  Oh, where have I gone?
[01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.150]  You don't want to go down there.
[01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:29.910]  There's nobody over that way.
[01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:33.570]  Oh shit!
[01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.650]  Oh!
[01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.130]  Oh shit!
[01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:38.090]  Oh shit!
[01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:43.030]  Sod it.
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:44.190]  You're brilliant.
[01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:46.090]  I told you not to go down that way.
[01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:48.550]  Gavin, your time!
[01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:51.590]  You're the smartest guy
[01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:52.350]  I've ever met.
[01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:54.070]  Jesus Christ.
[01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.030]  They need to make another level of
[01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.390]  Mensa just for you.
[01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:02.250]  Geoff's being too nice.
[01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.170]  I'm just saying how I feel, man.
[01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:06.430]  I just think you guys are real smart.
[01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:09.070]  I didn't die.
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:09.990]  I have a holy hand grenade.
[01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:11.050]  It's because you're so smart.
[01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.710]  I just complimented you. You're welcome.
[01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:16.770]  I didn't die.
[01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:20.130]  Where are you going?
[01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.010]  I want to get up and over.
[01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:25.930]  You got it.
[01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:30.170]  Come on.
[01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.850]  Okay, fuck this.
[01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:36.090]  No, you got this.
[01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.370]  Oh, he's going under.
[01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:39.390]  Oh, wow!
[01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:41.930]  It'd be great if it could...
[01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:43.810]  Give me the box! I want the box!
[01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:44.970]  You got it.
[01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:46.350]  Plenty of time.
[01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.590]  I just said plenty of time.
[01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:55.910]  What should I dismantle?
[01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:57.710]  What can I build?
[01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:01.910]  What can I build?
[01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:06.910]  Oh, no.
[01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:09.150]  What is that?
[01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:10.290]  What is what?
[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.810]  What's what?
[01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:13.750]  The point?
[01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.830]  Oh, an airstrike.
[01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:17.310]  He's pointing right at you.
[01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:18.950]  He's making noises.
[01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:21.070]  Most of those missed.
[01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:22.570]  Yeah, I didn't do much.
[01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:24.910]  That's a warning!
[01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.670]  Next time, it'll be the right warning.
[01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:32.310]  Well, let's not assume I'm the boss.
[01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:34.990]  We haven't watched the Super Smash Brothers.
[01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.870]  Oh, that's right!
[01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:38.030]  That video that you can watch at patreon.com
[01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:40.110]  slash regulationpod right now.
[01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.350]  You can watch it right now.
[01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:43.790]  Or the second after this is over.
[01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:45.790]  If you watch it at the same time, I don't care.
[01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:49.390]  Let's try for real this time.
[01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.830]  Oh, good. Oh, wow.
[01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:53.990]  Hey, Gavin, let's try for real this time.
[01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:59.490]  He's already sick.
[01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:01.610]  Oh, you're gonna put her out of her misery.
[01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:02.670]  It's like a mercy killing.
[01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.990]  Yeah!
[01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:06.170]  Nick's a real Dr. Kevorkian.
[01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:07.870]  Oh, my God!
[01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:11.930]  It's like Nick was lonely
[01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.610]  and wanted to bring a friend over.
[01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:15.490]  Yeah, just to watch him die, apparently.
[01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.790]  And then kill him in front of his feet.
[01:19:18.610 --> 01:19:19.490]  Oh, Nick!
[01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:20.970]  I want you to know it was me.
[01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:25.770]  Okay.
[01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:25.870]  Okay.
[01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:29.530]  This woman needs some health.
[01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:33.650]  Wow, you're risking a great deal
[01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:34.410]  heading this way.
[01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:38.090]  This is a live game, Cobra67.
[01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.530]  Is this a live comment?
[01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:45.390]  Undeniably, now.
[01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:46.950]  Can I get this health or something?
[01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:49.330]  A lot of people enjoyed
[01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:51.250]  not even a full day
[01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:52.770]  of regulation listener status.
[01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:54.270]  Just a medium in the comment leaver.
[01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:56.910]  I don't bet there's nothing wrong with being a comment leader.
[01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.930]  We've talked about it before.
[01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.210]  Not in the slightest, no.
[01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:03.190]  You just need to massage it a tiny bit
[01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:03.830]  and you'll get it.
[01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.070]  If they're here and they haven't heard the first episode,
[01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:07.770]  are they just regulation viewers right now?
[01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:10.830]  What?
[01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:13.050]  They haven't listened to anything yet.
[01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:14.630]  That's true.
[01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.170]  I mean, they're listening to us talk, Nick.
[01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:20.770]  If you have your eyes closed
[01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:22.290]  the whole time, then you're a regulation listener.
[01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:23.030]  Okay, fair.
[01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:26.730]  Somebody said,
[01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:28.790]  was Dr. Kevorkian really a bad guy
[01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.590]  like they made him out to be when I was growing up?
[01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:32.110]  Not if you were trying to die, he wasn't.
[01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:32.610]  What?
[01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:36.070]  The Regulation Podcast!
[01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:38.630]  Why did someone ask that?
[01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:40.590]  I don't know, maybe somebody
[01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:42.290]  lived in a very religious family or something?
[01:20:42.850 --> 01:20:43.090]  I don't know.
[01:20:44.770 --> 01:20:46.610]  Regulation Podcast, really excited for you guys
[01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:49.090]  to launch this Patreon, so let me ask about Dr. Kevorkian.
[01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.510]  No!
[01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:54.930]  How are you going to get anything in there?
[01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:56.130]  Go for it, man.
[01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:57.810]  He's only got one health.
[01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:59.850]  It's going to hit the flamethrower.
[01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:02.110]  Yep, it is.
[01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:03.890]  You're right.
[01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:05.930]  I was trying to needle it a little.
[01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:08.270]  Yeah, you needled something.
[01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:12.750]  Geoff's still winning.
[01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:14.830]  How many of these do you have left?
[01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:15.530]  Oh, God.
[01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:18.570]  Wow, two full health.
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.040]  Will the Krutovs still come out?
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.240]  Hell yeah.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.020]  People are excited about the Krutovs.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.760]  I don't even know who won the Krutovs.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.020]  Oh, yeah, you don't.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:40.640]  Oh, that's true.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.360]  I can't remember who won.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.700]  I can't remember who won.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.040]  I'm going to be editing the footage and be like,
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:50.440]  oh, yeah.
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.100]  There's no way you're going to thread that in there.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.640]  You might as well just go for one of the other players on a different team.
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.720]  Wow, that worked.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.940]  No, you're not going to be able to make that either, honestly.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:01.660]  Well, we'll find out.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.120]  I would probably go with Joan or McCord.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:06.900]  What?
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:10.800]  It's like, how did I hurt Andrew?
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.140]  See, you didn't listen to me.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760]  I didn't hurt you more.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.620]  Nick, you've hurt me enough.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:22.680]  Okay.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.620]  What you thinking, Gavin?
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.860]  I like where Gavin's going.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.860]  I think I could just...
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.260]  from above...
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.340]  Just drop it out the window.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.880]  Yeah, you could just drop it straight down.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.240]  Should I go up and down?
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.880]  Cut a hole in the helicopter.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.520]  I think the angle might be a little too much.
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.100]  No, I would go straight up.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.640]  Make sure you get enough beans, dude.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.860]  You're going to fuck me hard.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.760]  Oh, that was great, dude!
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.720]  What a throw!
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:51.640]  That's...
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.160]  Wow!
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.340]  Great throw!
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.940]  You should be proud of yourself.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.900]  Gavin, I can't even be mad at that.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.560]  That was so good!
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.820]  Geoff should throw that one off the ledge.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640]  It was quite an easy...
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.680]  It was easy in theory.
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.200]  I just can't believe I pulled it off because I'm incompetent most of the time.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:11.620]  Hahaha!
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.980]  Maybe get back in this game.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.900]  Let's get a...
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:18.420]  jetpack going.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.620]  Let's get some of this health.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.920]  That is a...
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.260]  100 new health.
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.020]  Oh!
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.700]  Oh, it was almost zero.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.900]  Another shoot. Another jetpack.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.200]  You got 150 health?
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.780]  What is happening?
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.000]  Oh, just go off the ledge.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:36.560]  No!
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.300]  No!
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:39.080]  Wow.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.720]  Max health.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:41.900]  Congratulations.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.700]  Let's try killing this guy again.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:46.940]  Which one?
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.020]  Probably anybody but Geoff.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.260]  Hahaha!
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.760]  Get him!
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:54.940]  Get him!
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.040]  Get him!
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.200]  No!
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.000]  You're getting closer.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.920]  Geoff is going to dig down now.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.400]  Do a little dig down.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.440]  Not if I get there first.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:12.960]  No, Geoff.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:13.760]  Don't do it.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:16.520]  What are you doing?
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.060]  What's he doing?
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:19.680]  Geoff?
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.760]  Oh my god.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.820]  300 health.
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:27.200]  Look at that.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.140]  It's too much health.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.760]  This isn't going to kill you.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.180]  It's just too much health.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.000]  We got to take some of it away.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:35.860]  I'm not even mad about it.
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:37.520]  30.
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.240]  That's more acceptable. 284 I can live with.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:41.800]  Sure.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.140]  Yeah, I get it.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.680]  284 he can live with.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.240]  It's all good.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.240]  Andrew, aka Nick.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.680]  Nick's final worm.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.140]  My final worm.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:56.720]  Get him!
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.260]  You're going to thread the same needle?
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.040]  Sorry, Geoff. It has to be done.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.620]  You guys have put a lot of effort into killing the guy with one health.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.020]  Wow!
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.100]  Look at that! It's two balls.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.760]  Someone blowtorched the cock.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.840]  Uh-oh, there's a lump.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.420]  I would have, but I'm dead.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.520]  I mean, Nick is in perfect cock position.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:19.400]  Alright!
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:23.860]  Opening day in perfect cock position.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.680]  Okay, what have we got?
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:27.260]  What are the goodies?
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.280]  What are the goodies?
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.620]  What are the baddies?
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.000]  Oh, I know what.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.720]  Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that shit.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:44.700]  Nailed it.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.560]  Can I get down there?
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.240]  Yeah.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.180]  I might need to equip this bad boy.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:52.420]  Is this on?
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.680]  Am I using this now?
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.240]  Yeah, you just fall and you're good.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:56.560]  Oh shit, the wind!
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.420]  The wind!
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:58.900]  Oh shit!
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.580]  Oh, you're blown away!
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.320]  Gust him!
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.480]  Son of a bitch!
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.060]  I couldn't figure it out.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.700]  I couldn't figure you out.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.060]  I couldn't crack the worms code, fellas.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.600]  I fully panicked there. I could have landed so much higher up,
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.380]  but I just panicked.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:20.740]  Oh my god.
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.500]  Oh my god.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.160]  Okay, 1%.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.620]  You should probably just kill yourself.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.200]  No, I'm good.
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:30.180]  Jesus Christ!
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.080]  I'm gonna go get this box.
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.220]  Yeah, do it and then put yourself in it.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.480]  Nah, I'm good.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.500]  What's in the box is what's left of Andrew.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:42.960]  Don't come back.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:44.860]  Don't even think about it.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.480]  No, I'm not gonna target you. You gotta make a dick.
[01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.020]  You have important work to do.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:48.560]  I do.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.060]  I'm our last hope.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:54.680]  Plenty of time.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.720]  I don't even really know what this does.
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:02.200]  I hope it injects me with health.
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:03.900]  Oh shit, it bounces!
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:04.780]  Oh my god!
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:08.500]  Oh no!
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.440]  The dick!
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.520]  I ruined the balls!
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:13.840]  Wow.
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.520]  You just
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.200]  completely exploded that dick.
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.260]  Just like earlier today.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.720]  That was a little foreshadowing
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.620]  when we started the stream.
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.920]  I feel like that was excessive.
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.720]  Can I craft anything else?
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:32.640]  Yes!
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.440]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.580]  Look at the crafting.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.660]  Oh, what's this?
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:42.780]  Dead.
[01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:47.630]  That was such a cool idea.
[01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:49.850]  I wanna try it.
[01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:52.650]  Hell yeah!
[01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:56.450]  Oh, it missed me!
[01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.050]  Oh, Joan, look out!
[01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:02.290]  That's insane.
[01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:06.110]  Insane.
[01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:08.710]  Oh no, it did a little damage.
[01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:10.770]  Insane.
[01:28:13.190 --> 01:28:14.550]  He can be continuing his phone streams
[01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:17.390]  definitely, and maybe some actual ones.
[01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:18.530]  Oh yeah!
[01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:21.130]  I think we're all gonna start
[01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.870]  streaming, right? More often?
[01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:25.150]  Yeah, of course. Every week on the channel.
[01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.130]  Every Friday.
[01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:29.390]  For safety.
[01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:31.350]  Also probably outside of that a little bit.
[01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.150]  Yeah.
[01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.970]  Yeah.
[01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:34.930]  Yeah.
[01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:37.010]  Alright.
[01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:41.150]  Okay, let's really study the map.
[01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.870]  How?
[01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.330]  Alright, let's study.
[01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.870]  Studying...
[01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:48.590]  I've zoomed out all the way, so everyone can see what you're looking at.
[01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.430]  Now that our job doesn't require us to talk to each other
[01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:52.870]  and play video games all day long,
[01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:54.910]  we're free to finally talk to each other
[01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:56.350]  and play video games all day long.
[01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:06.070]  Oh, look at what you've done there.
[01:29:07.190 --> 01:29:08.010]  Did anybody update
[01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:08.650]  the Instagram?
[01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:10.030]  Ah, shit.
[01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:12.730]  The what now?
[01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:12.970]  Shit.
[01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:15.550]  The fuckface Instagram account?
[01:29:16.630 --> 01:29:16.850]  Nope.
[01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.950]  Right.
[01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:20.670]  Oh yeah.
[01:29:22.050 --> 01:29:23.370]  What are you talking about?
[01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:25.830]  I guess we can't.
[01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:26.890]  Yeah!
[01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:29.010]  I just...
[01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:32.750]  Well, I'm glad they're all on the same page then.
[01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:34.310]  We're just not making this easy, are we?
[01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.770]  Okay.
[01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:38.750]  Are you talking about the game or life?
[01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:39.570]  Yeah, sure.
[01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:40.630]  All of it.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.920]  I'm gonna throw an airstrike down.
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.900]  See, he's got 69 health. I don't know why you would
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:57.140]  ever want to change that.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.740]  Because he's horny.
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.200]  Oof, that's not good.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.800]  Well, I don't think I did, so you're all good.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:09.740]  Boring.
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:09.900]  Boring.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.360]  Glogg Chundler holding on.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.580]  He's my original worm.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.260]  I don't know what it is about those words
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.840]  all together is just fucked up.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:25.740]  Glogg Chundler, he's my original worm.
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:28.500]  My first worm.
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:37.860]  What are you?
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:38.200]  Wow.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.740]  Oh, oh.
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:43.220]  I was hoping for more
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.120]  of a fall.
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:50.880]  How do I...
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.220]  We don't have a
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.320]  monetized Twitch, do we?
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:56.240]  Correct.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.900]  As of right now, we do not.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.360]  We are overcoming some
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.020]  hurdles in the background.
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.240]  But yeah, feel free to
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.020]  go to Patreon.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.320]  Follow for now.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.320]  Whatever you are going to give to this,
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.300]  go put on the Patreon, and then we'll
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.000]  figure this out later.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.760]  And then immediately start to enjoy the benefits of doing so.
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:17.160]  Not at all.
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.120]  Not even a little.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.740]  See, I would have told you not to do that.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.920]  Well, I guess you were right the first time.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.220]  I try to be.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:27.280]  Okay.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.280]  Let's give it some of this.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.880]  This is going to work out great for you.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:33.480]  Oh shit!
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.260]  Oh shit!
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:36.560]  Freaking hell.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.200]  God,
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.940]  it sucks being me.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:41.900]  Yeah.
[01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.060]  God damn.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.600]  I've made myself a flaming bat.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:49.960]  No!
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:51.980]  No!
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:53.860]  No!
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:56.720]  No!
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.440]  That's so funny.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.780]  You know what 242 health means?
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.680]  It means you drown so much slower.
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:04.440]  I barely have a health bar.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.380]  A painful death.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:07.540]  Is Jon still alive?
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.480]  Oh, barely.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.980]  Remember the war on people
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:13.800]  with one health?
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.560]  There was absolutely no reason to use that bat either.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.980]  I feel like a prod would have done it.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:19.400]  Yeah.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.560]  Yeah, it was fucking badass.
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:23.280]  That was the reason.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.240]  You were sending a message.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.900]  What do I do?
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.980]  You're a real Negan, Gav.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.680]  Oh, from Walking Dead?
[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:36.380]  He did a bat thing.
[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.740]  Fuck the guy's eye out.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.800]  I think I'm going to have to hunt Andrew.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.000]  I have one health!
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:48.820]  What do you mean?
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:49.720]  And I have one guy.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.460]  Yeah, that shit didn't work when I said it.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:52.880]  I don't know why it's supposed to work when you say it.
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.780]  One man with one health.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.220]  You didn't go underground?
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.000]  I did.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:01.900]  Oh, now the health
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:03.500]  spawns where I was.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.260]  Great. Thanks, game.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.200]  I'm going to see if I can get to it before you can.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.600]  Oh, what to do?
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.140]  Oh, goodness.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:13.980]  Um...
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:16.180]  Well...
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.200]  I don't really have a lot of...
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.120]  I gotta...
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.080]  I could do this.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.340]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:26.660]  Um...
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:27.200]  Whatcha...
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.520]  I need to move.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.960]  There we go. I'm going to do this.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.360]  Now I'm going to do this.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.840]  I'm going to do this.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.760]  Now I'm going to do...
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:39.440]  this.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.360]  And then I'm going to go like...
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.260]  Why are you doing this?
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.640]  Geoff, you better hurry. You got two seconds.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.260]  Oh!
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.520]  Oh!
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:51.420]  Oh!
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.020]  Oh, my God!
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:55.660]  Almost worked.
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.120]  Hey, congratulations, nearly.
[01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:00.300]  Yeah, damn near got it.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.580]  Horseshoes, hand grenades,
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.460]  and homing rockets.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.700]  Ooh, it's me.
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:09.880]  Yeah, go get it, Nick.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.540]  Go get that health.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.040]  Oh, I thought it was...
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.540]  I was really hoping.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.920]  I didn't remember whose turret that was.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.940]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.940]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:33.260]  Oh, Geoff's crafting.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:35.420]  Always.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.180]  Can you craft health?
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.220]  I don't think so.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.060]  Good Lord!
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:47.440]  Oh, my God.
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.500]  Oh, that didn't work.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.580]  It was like a firework.
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:53.080]  I like that you were charging before you aimed.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.720]  I, uh...
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.260]  I was a little short of myself.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:58.980]  Okay.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.540]  More help for Delta. Nailed it.
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:03.200]  Nailed it.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.140]  Nailed it.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.880]  Just blow a hole.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.820]  It'll fall right on you.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:11.900]  Oh, okay.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.660]  Shoot the health.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:14.380]  Oh, he got it.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:15.940]  Let go now.
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.740]  That's Gavin whenever he sees feet.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:23.800]  Yeah, get him, Andrew.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.040]  Yeah, get him.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.140]  I can only attack verbally.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:28.380]  I got one health.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.040]  I need to put this somewhere, because I've made it.
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.900]  So why don't I put it...
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:34.860]  Somewhere.
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:36.940]  Oh, shit.
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:37.900]  Oh, God, no.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:38.840]  No, no, no!
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.240]  Oh, no!
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:42.960]  Wow!
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:45.700]  No!
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.340]  Overkill.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.080]  Nick is out of the game.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.740]  I thought you did a great job, Nick.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.600]  Well, now we know who likes you least, Nick.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:57.220]  It's Gavin.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.880]  So remember that for future voting.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.540]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.400]  I don't know if that's the truth.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:06.260]  What?
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:06.740]  Wait, what does that mean?
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:07.540]  What?
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.420]  It's time for Joan.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.240]  Let me out of here.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.700]  Go to the Joan zone.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:21.580]  No.
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:22.100]  Don't get that.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.620]  One health is kind of your thing.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.080]  You lose a lot of identity when you pick up that health.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:26.500]  Yeah.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.660]  Joan's whole character arc changes after this.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:30.540]  Exactly.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.900]  You're going to lose the audience.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.200]  Joan, Joan, Joan, who?
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.360]  Yeah, now you're just everybody else.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:36.320]  They're not going to root for you.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:37.800]  No!
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.800]  I got him!
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.760]  Hey, we tried to warn him.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:44.640]  Yep.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.640]  What are you going to do?
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.020]  I tried to tell you.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.580]  Just fucking tried.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.140]  I forgot I put that there.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.840]  So did I!
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.760]  I commented on it a turn ago.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.670]  Anything I can do...
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.720]  So I'm going to have to try one of these bad boys.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:07.960]  Why don't you come at me, son?
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:10.040]  Uh-oh.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.760]  Oh, I didn't mean it.
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:17.880]  You can pack up again, Geoff.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.720]  Yeah, Geoff.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.020]  No, no, I'm good.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.480]  I don't think you are, Geoff.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.120]  Now can I attack him?
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:24.980]  Oh, I didn't mean to pack it.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:25.300]  Shit.
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.460]  Oh, what did I do?
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:29.420]  You wasted a full jetpack.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.480]  Way to go, man.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.520]  You wasted your whole second jetpack.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.200]  How does it happen for you like this all the time?
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.220]  I just don't understand.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.840]  Oh, he's burning through!
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:41.580]  It's just bad luck, man.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:42.760]  I'm coming for you.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:45.560]  I'm like the Terminator. You can't stop me.
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.460]  I'm running, but...
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.060]  I'm walking, but it looks like I'm running.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:51.020]  Wearing a cop suit.
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:55.000]  Oh, look at all that health in front of the turret.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.000]  Okay.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.280]  Now.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.040]  Let's have a think.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.500]  There's too much shit all over the map.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.920]  Okay, let's get safe.
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.740]  What have I got that I can throw?
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:13.160]  What an inconvenience for you to be still playing the game.
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.280]  How bad I feel.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.660]  Yeah, I'm really bummed out for you.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.800]  It's nice that everybody feels so bad for you.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:21.180]  Yeah.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.600]  We're all sympathetic.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:25.140]  Shoulders to cry on or whatever.
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:27.960]  Damn it.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.400]  You having trouble?
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:33.960]  Well, you've got plenty of time to figure it out.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:35.840]  Yeah, well...
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.240]  Nah, you don't worry about it. You got it.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.540]  I wouldn't do that.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.320]  I'm going to hit you.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:45.860]  Where'd it go? Oh, there it is.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.400]  Nice.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:57.800]  Well...
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.400]  What?
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.720]  Great job, champ.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.740]  What's the plan?
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.540]  What are you going to do?
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:06.880]  Wow, that's...
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:07.700]  Please.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.320]  What am I going to do?
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.840]  I don't have a whole hell of a lot to do with.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.160]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:17.500]  I'm going to do something stupid.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:19.000]  No!
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.400]  Oh, you're so dead.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.000]  Oh my god!
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.880]  What a move!
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.180]  I'm just...
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.700]  That completely leveled the playing field.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.620]  I cannot believe that worked.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:33.240]  Yep.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.440]  You just John McClane shot yourself
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.600]  through the shoulders to kill the bad guy.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.120]  I think you're cool.
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:41.680]  I don't know.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.980]  You know what, Nick? I am like John McClane.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.180]  Thanks for pointing it out.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:46.800]  You're welcome.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:47.660]  That's a good point.
[01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.680]  I've always thought of myself as a John McClane kind of guy.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:54.380]  Me and Bruce Willis.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.940]  Then, not now.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:00.000]  Thanks.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:00.680]  Yeah.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:06.980]  I don't know what you're doing.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:07.780]  What's happening?
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.500]  I'm figuring out some stuff.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.040]  You went into hiding?
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.520]  I wouldn't call it hiding.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.740]  I'd call it preparation.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:18.840]  Okay.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.920]  That's my craft.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:24.220]  You just sounded like a doomsday prepper.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:26.580]  He did.
[01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.310]  Oh, what's this?
[01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:32.510]  What are you doing here?
[01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:34.490]  Let's see what happens.
[01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:39.110]  Oh, he's locking on with the RPG.
[01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:40.710]  Is that like the ultra homing missile?
[01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:42.830]  We'll find out.
[01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.670]  Ouch.
[01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:46.670]  Well.
[01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:49.370]  Take that.
[01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:50.090]  One.
[01:40:50.850 --> 01:40:52.150]  How much was that?
[01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:53.770]  Three damage.
[01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:55.950]  And then seven.
[01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.910]  Ten.
[01:40:59.130 --> 01:41:00.990]  I just gotta throw something.
[01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.870]  What can I chuck?
[01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:05.490]  Chuck a grenade?
[01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:07.710]  Yeah, that's always an option.
[01:41:08.710 --> 01:41:09.590]  Just keep it classic.
[01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:10.850]  There's a wide range of those you can pick from.
[01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:13.410]  Yeah, let's get chucking.
[01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:15.850]  You wanna have a grenade?
[01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:16.570]  You wanna play gorillas?
[01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:18.890]  Just throw bananas at each other?
[01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:22.850]  Do it.
[01:41:25.050 --> 01:41:25.910]  You got this.
[01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:27.410]  This is brilliant.
[01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:30.850]  What a toss.
[01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:31.570]  You nailed it.
[01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:32.670]  There you go, dude.
[01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:34.390]  Hell yeah, dude. That was sick.
[01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:36.950]  I've learned a lot from that. Don't worry.
[01:41:37.450 --> 01:41:38.230]  Oh, that's good.
[01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:40.830]  Life is all about learning.
[01:41:42.010 --> 01:41:44.250]  Assuming you still have one after this.
[01:41:44.910 --> 01:41:46.830]  I was really impressed with that.
[01:41:48.810 --> 01:41:49.690]  Oh, shit.
[01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:52.090]  I'm gonna go ahead and...
[01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:53.210]  How many of these did you make?
[01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:54.970]  Hopefully enough.
[01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:57.790]  And then I'm just gonna...
[01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:59.470]  Just full balls of Geoff.
[01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:02.290]  Oh no, it's gonna come around.
[01:42:03.190 --> 01:42:03.630]  Solid.
[01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:06.250]  You got luck.
[01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.210]  So what is it, like a cluster homing missile?
[01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:09.330]  I can't tell you.
[01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:10.930]  It won't let me.
[01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:14.050]  I wanted to, but it said no.
[01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:15.530]  I want the wind to change.
[01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:18.450]  I have some parachuting
[01:42:18.450 --> 01:42:19.050]  I need to do.
[01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:22.110]  Oh, look at the wind!
[01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:26.290]  Wait, the wind impacts things
[01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:26.790]  in this game?
[01:42:27.650 --> 01:42:30.370]  It impacts bazookas
[01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:31.130]  and...
[01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:34.110]  And parachute direction?
[01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:35.490]  I can't get over that, though.
[01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:36.410]  That's a real problem.
[01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:37.430]  How do I change?
[01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:43.210]  Six second fuse.
[01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:44.230]  Oh, wow.
[01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:46.650]  I feel like I'm watching a tennis game, but
[01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:48.370]  people are just double faulting.
[01:42:49.190 --> 01:42:50.070]  Over and over again.
[01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:53.110]  3, 2, 1.
[01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:53.950]  That was good.
[01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:55.510]  That was a respectable throw.
[01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:02.470]  I wish I had those.
[01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.590]  Okay.
[01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:09.010]  This is like a visual representation of Battleship.
[01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:10.590]  It is.
[01:43:11.010 --> 01:43:12.410]  Here's where we are now.
[01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:13.770]  This is what we're left with.
[01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:16.690]  You're trying to RPG him?
[01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:17.550]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:20.330]  This is the good shit right here.
[01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:22.510]  Can I get you to reconsider, possibly?
[01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:26.610]  That was really close.
[01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:27.730]  I'm dialing it in.
[01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:31.070]  We're in a pissing-tossing
[01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.510]  match.
[01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:37.770]  Alright.
[01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:40.350]  We like the six second fuse.
[01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.230]  We love the six second fuse.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:52.160]  No.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:54.160]  A little short.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:56.360]  I think your food is still delicious.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.940]  It's probably even better.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.160]  The extra whatever in the microwave.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160]  Alright, so...
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.220]  Know how that hinge...
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:09.200]  Delta P crab the crab that got sucked down the pipeline.
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:09.580]  Yes.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.180]  That was a circular drill.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:13.960]  Damn!
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.200]  Was that like an America grenade?
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:17.780]  What was that?
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.800]  Don't worry about it.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:22.960]  It explodes freedom.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.880]  I did that earlier.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:31.240]  RIP to that crab, by the way.
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.060]  Okay.
[01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:37.310]  I honestly
[01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:39.170]  don't even really care who wins this. I just want to see
[01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:39.810]  someone hit someone.
[01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:42.990]  I want to see one of these throw to be over.
[01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:47.330]  No, I really want to see
[01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:48.710]  one of you land one of these throws.
[01:44:49.050 --> 01:44:51.010]  One of them is going to drown at some point.
[01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:52.190]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:54.970]  It's the most likely outcome.
[01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:56.570]  Here we go. That's it.
[01:44:56.710 --> 01:44:57.450]  That's one of these.
[01:44:57.450 --> 01:44:57.850]  Ah!
[01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:03.070]  You're going to have to stop
[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:04.510]  climbing real soon.
[01:45:04.690 --> 01:45:06.010]  This is the slowest death.
[01:45:07.530 --> 01:45:07.670]  Oh.
[01:45:09.190 --> 01:45:09.950]  Wow.
[01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:12.690]  Just jump.
[01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.150]  Oh.
[01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:15.150]  Oh, what?
[01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:17.350]  You got a box.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:23.920]  That's...
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.100]  Oh, that might be...
[01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:28.160]  That might be...
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.340]  Son of the back of my dick!
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.920]  It's so funny you said son of the back of your dick
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:39.580]  because that's exactly what I was thinking too.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.740]  Oh, that's great.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.820]  Earlier I crafted a two-handed
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.880]  poke, but I'm not close enough to use it.
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:47.680]  Maybe I need to just
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:48.280]  come over there.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:50.340]  Maybe you do.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:51.440]  Maybe you do.
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.940]  Maybe I'll run up to welcome for you.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:55.960]  Oh shit.
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:57.740]  What's he got?
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.000]  I'm not liking this. Another homing.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.020]  No.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.700]  You're so well protected.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.900]  I think that one you got to launch
[01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:09.980]  as high as possible, Geoff, because I think it will curve more.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:10.360]  Yeah.
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.600]  You got to arc up and over.
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:18.840]  Should I just keep tossing these?
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.360]  I think you should just keep
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.040]  hocking them. You're getting close.
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:25.760]  Geoff's crafting again.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.740]  Fire in the hole.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:28.900]  But he can't tell you what.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:30.620]  Uh oh.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.800]  Son of a bitch.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:35.840]  I can't
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.280]  split that difference. I suck.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:39.800]  Maybe this
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.820]  next turn you'll get it.
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.640]  Oh, that's bull.
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:46.520]  Really?
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:48.900]  That's awesome.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:51.640]  I don't need it.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:53.340]  What are you doing?
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.160]  Are you air striking me?
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:55.940]  What are you doing?
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.160]  Oh, I think you might land that.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:00.260]  You don't have to air strike the final one.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:05.580]  Oh, God.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.960]  It's all over.
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.720]  Anyone could have done that?
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.640]  I didn't know that was against the rules. It was a bunker buster.
[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:18.320]  I got seven of those.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.820]  I got a billion air strikes.
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:21.140]  Come on!
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.400]  Why did you use them?
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.140]  Well, it's just...
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.740]  It's just not done, Geoff.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:28.540]  It's just not done.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:32.600]  I'm so sorry I won.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.320]  Well, at least you're sorry.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:39.880]  I mean, I had the most kills and the least
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:41.940]  deaths and the most damage, but yeah.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.940]  Yeah, you tend to have the least
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.700]  deaths when you have a worm left at the end.
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:46.440]  Yeah.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.880]  Well, that's how victory works.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:50.580]  Alright.
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.620]  Well, congratulations on victory.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.740]  I think that this is a good
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:57.680]  time for us to take a break before we
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.580]  come back for some Sloppy Joe's bingo
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:00.680]  a little bit later tonight.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:04.260]  I need a fucking nap after this.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.260]  Dude, I've been
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:07.100]  doing this since like eight this morning.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:09.300]  I'm ready to lay down face first on the ground.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.560]  This has been
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.400]  awesome. Our Patreon
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.660]  is going off, and it's because of you guys.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:19.020]  We have so much
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:19.660]  support
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.420]  from you, and we can't
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.880]  thank you enough.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.720]  Thanks so much for giving us a head start
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:27.520]  because we started with
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:29.700]  negative, basically. Yeah, pretty much.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:30.980]  It's been difficult to
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.580]  dig out of the hole to the
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.260]  starting gate.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.520]  Very excited
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.240]  about what's next
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.620]  and what we can do and how we can do that
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:43.720]  for you and the way that we can work together
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:45.080]  and make the show grow and everything.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:47.640]  We're going to go so hard and
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.880]  get so sloppy
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.420]  it's going to be a mess. I only just
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.720]  mopped up all my dick.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.000]  You better put a cardigan on it.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.660]  You're going to need it later tonight.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.580]  Any thoughts? Anything we want
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.560]  to leave these people with before we come on back
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.040]  and everything?
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:05.560]  I don't think I can top the imagery
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:06.480]  that Gavin just gave.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:07.980]  Thank you, obviously.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:11.220]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:12.760]  Thanks in advance
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.820]  for giving us a chance.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.460]  If you ever enjoyed anything
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.540]  we did for the previous 21 years,
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.060]  hopefully you'll enjoy this going forward.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.700]  And if everybody wants to pray
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:22.820]  for Gavin's dick,
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.400]  it needs it.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:26.340]  It's got a lot to put back together.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.560]  It's a puzzle, for sure.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.840]  It's exciting.
