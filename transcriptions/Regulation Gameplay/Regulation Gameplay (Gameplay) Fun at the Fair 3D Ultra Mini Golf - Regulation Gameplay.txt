[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  We're back, mini-golfing. Back in horseshit world.
[00:03.360 --> 00:05.700]  Uh, Nick was too scared to play.
[00:05.840 --> 00:09.540]  Yeah, Nick's like, oh, it's not working. I don't know what's going on.
[00:09.920 --> 00:12.200]  Guys, I'm at my compute, my Xbox.
[00:12.840 --> 00:14.300]  He's being kind of baby about it.
[00:16.380 --> 00:18.720]  Anyway, I like to watch. Oh, that sounded weird.
[00:22.160 --> 00:22.640]  Uh...
[00:22.640 --> 00:23.920]  Oh, wow.
[00:24.440 --> 00:26.340]  Wow. It's everywhere, too.
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.700]  Yeah, it's, uh...
[00:29.080 --> 00:30.300]  Talk about backshots, right?
[00:30.920 --> 00:31.900]  Poor Michael.
[00:34.180 --> 00:35.740]  How many times has that been said?
[00:36.060 --> 00:37.100]  Oh, poor Michael.
[00:38.660 --> 00:41.160]  Gavin would pay $1,000 to shoot that horse.
[00:45.240 --> 00:47.440]  It knows what it did.
[00:47.960 --> 00:48.060]  Oh!
[00:48.520 --> 00:48.860]  Oh!
[00:50.120 --> 00:51.380]  This game sucks!
[00:53.020 --> 00:54.360]  I like the idea, though.
[00:54.400 --> 00:56.420]  Just a straight splat.
[00:58.700 --> 01:01.040]  I'm trying to find the glue, Treggs.
[01:02.040 --> 01:04.600]  I imagine if I'd done that, that would've been...
[01:04.600 --> 01:06.580]  Oh! Wow.
[01:07.380 --> 01:07.880]  Holy shit.
[01:09.240 --> 01:10.420]  Andrew's dialing it in.
[01:10.640 --> 01:12.960]  I would've never had that thought without him.
[01:14.500 --> 01:16.280]  Is this whole course the Old West?
[01:16.860 --> 01:17.500]  Ah, fuck.
[01:18.620 --> 01:19.580]  Well, that sucked.
[01:19.640 --> 01:20.680]  I got a free shot.
[01:21.740 --> 01:25.260]  That's a good question, Nick. Are there any other non-Old West holes?
[01:26.140 --> 01:26.980]  Oh, yeah, sorry.
[01:26.980 --> 01:29.040]  There's three different courses,
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.760]  so I think we'll be through the West,
[01:30.960 --> 01:33.440]  and then on to the second course here after this hole.
[01:33.680 --> 01:35.520]  I'll stop coming all over the map.
[01:35.660 --> 01:36.920]  Or maybe two more holes.
[01:37.500 --> 01:38.740]  I learned it from watching you, Gavin.
[01:39.280 --> 01:40.660]  I didn't come anywhere.
[01:45.980 --> 01:46.940]  Nice shot!
[01:47.360 --> 01:48.340]  There you go!
[01:50.100 --> 01:51.660]  It has begun!
[01:53.780 --> 01:55.300]  Hurry up, John Cena!
[01:55.300 --> 01:56.280]  Let's fucking go!
[02:00.600 --> 02:03.860]  I dodged a frickin' bullet twelve years ago when I was out of town.
[02:08.260 --> 02:09.060]  Oh, man.
[02:09.720 --> 02:10.640]  What am I gonna do?
[02:10.800 --> 02:11.920]  You know exactly what to do.
[02:12.480 --> 02:14.900]  Could you like overbeans to power through the glue?
[02:15.800 --> 02:17.140]  Or is the glue just glue?
[02:17.840 --> 02:19.640]  I think the glue's gonna glue pretty hard.
[02:20.000 --> 02:20.740]  We'll see what this does.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.400]  Thanks, man!
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.280]  Appreciate it!
[02:25.480 --> 02:26.920]  Just do what I can.
[02:31.680 --> 02:33.060]  That's all, folks!
[02:35.160 --> 02:35.560]  I sprung.
[02:37.740 --> 02:38.820]  Oh, that's nice.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.740]  Easy. Right down the middle.
[02:44.080 --> 02:45.540]  Yeah, there's no way you fuck this up.
[02:46.760 --> 02:47.360]  You got this.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.220]  Nailed it.
[02:48.880 --> 02:49.060]  Spring!
[02:49.640 --> 02:50.100]  Dammit!
[03:00.480 --> 03:03.240]  Go insane. Do it.
[03:05.480 --> 03:05.920]  Spring!
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.280]  Nice! Way to go!
[03:08.720 --> 03:10.900]  In for the birdie!
[03:12.300 --> 03:13.280]  I got lucky.
[03:15.220 --> 03:16.960]  Better be luckier than good, Geoff.
[03:17.120 --> 03:17.880]  You got this, Eric.
[03:19.020 --> 03:19.860]  Free shot!
[03:20.420 --> 03:21.860]  Well, it's like it never happened.
[03:22.380 --> 03:22.920]  Free shot!
[03:28.700 --> 03:30.280]  Why did I change the aim?
[03:30.380 --> 03:33.140]  I don't know. You just started hitting left and right.
[03:33.260 --> 03:33.980]  I don't know.
[03:41.980 --> 03:46.300]  Alright, free shot!
[03:49.420 --> 03:50.420]  This is good, though,
[03:50.460 --> 03:52.320]  because I can just keep practicing this shot
[03:52.780 --> 03:53.740]  indefinitely for my spot.
[03:53.760 --> 03:54.260]  This is good.
[03:56.800 --> 03:58.420]  Oh, he's doing a 360 no-scope.
[03:58.620 --> 03:59.160]  That was sick.
[04:01.880 --> 04:02.760]  Hey, bogey!
[04:03.220 --> 04:03.900]  Nice, dude.
[04:04.080 --> 04:06.100]  Dude, how are you on five? Some of us are only on two.
[04:08.320 --> 04:09.080]  It's true.
[04:10.560 --> 04:10.820]  Nope.
[04:12.480 --> 04:13.740]  Shut the fuck up.
[04:14.420 --> 04:16.100]  Come on. How did it not go?
[04:17.460 --> 04:18.200]  Oh, you got it.
[04:19.120 --> 04:20.140]  There you go.
[04:21.360 --> 04:22.640]  Beautiful birdie!
[04:23.820 --> 04:25.800]  Bang, baby. One under.
[04:26.000 --> 04:26.660]  Take that, Gavin.
[04:27.760 --> 04:28.260]  Game sucks.
[04:32.280 --> 04:35.220]  Oh, dude.
[04:35.360 --> 04:36.260]  Are we gonna train now?
[04:36.380 --> 04:38.600]  It's the choo-choo.
[04:40.940 --> 04:42.860]  You gonna hit that rail?
[04:43.660 --> 04:44.040]  Try.
[04:44.820 --> 04:45.420]  Wow!
[04:47.640 --> 04:49.520]  My ball is growing!
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.300]  Oh, okay. I guess that was it.
[04:51.820 --> 04:54.200]  Did you hit the button to do that, or did it automatically do it?
[04:54.200 --> 04:55.460]  No, I just did it.
[04:55.780 --> 04:56.100]  Ha!
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.420]  Get me that streak!
[05:00.820 --> 05:01.180]  Oh!
[05:02.460 --> 05:02.860]  Streak!
[05:03.340 --> 05:03.740]  Miss!
[05:06.160 --> 05:07.000]  Hole in one!
[05:07.640 --> 05:08.040]  Nice!
[05:09.980 --> 05:10.700]  Way to go.
[05:11.120 --> 05:12.120]  Needed that one, Gavin.
[05:14.380 --> 05:14.780]  Mudderail!
[05:17.200 --> 05:17.880]  Oh, that was easy.
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.140]  That was a lot easier than that.
[05:19.360 --> 05:20.980]  No! No! No!
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.820]  Sorry, I wasn't listening.
[05:24.040 --> 05:25.200]  You wanna say that one more time?
[05:26.160 --> 05:26.640]  Mudderail!
[05:30.460 --> 05:30.940]  Don't!
[05:32.440 --> 05:32.920]  Jesus!
[05:33.580 --> 05:34.440]  That was easy, guys.
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.620]  I didn't say it was easy!
[05:38.780 --> 05:39.740]  Sins of the father.
[05:40.580 --> 05:42.020]  She's a giant bull.
[05:42.640 --> 05:43.460]  Oh, yeah, she is.
[05:46.240 --> 05:47.900]  Oh, I thought it was...
[05:47.900 --> 05:48.780]  Hey, sorry, Andrew.
[05:48.920 --> 05:49.720]  The mob has spoken.
[05:52.720 --> 05:54.160]  This is easy!
[05:55.080 --> 05:55.520]  Easy!
[05:59.060 --> 06:00.200]  Right back to the beginning!
[06:02.360 --> 06:03.240]  You shielded?
[06:06.540 --> 06:10.100]  Alright, Geoff, you got this one.
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.280]  Spring!
[06:11.840 --> 06:12.760]  There you go, buddy.
[06:14.820 --> 06:15.260]  Spring!
[06:20.740 --> 06:23.000]  Gavin, you're in a pretty good spot right now.
[06:23.440 --> 06:23.460]  Yeah.
[06:25.000 --> 06:25.860]  I assume that will last...
[06:26.440 --> 06:27.760]  throughout the video.
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.540]  It's at least evened the playing field again.
[06:31.160 --> 06:31.980]  From the first hole.
[06:35.080 --> 06:36.800]  Is that also a shield that electricity?
[06:37.460 --> 06:37.960]  Oh, shit.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.260]  What were you doing?
[06:40.260 --> 06:42.620]  I thought it would bounce off the wall.
[06:42.960 --> 06:44.020]  You dunce.
[06:44.440 --> 06:45.400]  Mind the gap.
[06:47.640 --> 06:49.200]  Oh, I'm sorry for assuming
[06:49.200 --> 06:50.960]  that the train would be physical
[06:50.960 --> 06:52.300]  and not invisible.
[06:52.680 --> 06:54.480]  Yeah, no, I get it. Apology accepted.
[06:54.600 --> 06:54.940]  No problem.
[06:55.020 --> 06:56.980]  I don't think it was that. I think you just hit it off the platform.
[06:58.100 --> 06:59.200]  No, it went through the train.
[07:00.800 --> 07:03.460]  The train went transparent because you went under the train.
[07:03.980 --> 07:05.100]  Maybe it's a ghost train.
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.960]  Yeah, honestly, Gavin might be right.
[07:07.840 --> 07:08.940]  You should try to hit the train again.
[07:09.460 --> 07:10.860]  Yeah, see what happens with the train.
[07:14.490 --> 07:17.230]  I like the confidence that Gavin has
[07:17.230 --> 07:18.430]  now that he's got a hole in one.
[07:18.970 --> 07:19.330]  Shit!
[07:20.450 --> 07:21.630]  Yeah, you know what? That's a ghost train.
[07:27.430 --> 07:28.410]  You've got ghost feet.
[07:29.530 --> 07:30.410]  I don't have ghost feet.
[07:30.710 --> 07:31.690]  I don't like to talk about them.
[07:34.110 --> 07:34.910]  Oh, wow!
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.290]  Can I work out of my hole?
[07:40.350 --> 07:40.750]  What?
[07:42.310 --> 07:43.310]  Working out of my hole.
[07:44.830 --> 07:45.610]  This is dangerous.
[07:46.070 --> 07:46.910]  You're working out your hole.
[07:47.370 --> 07:48.450]  I'm working out my hole.
[07:49.470 --> 07:52.010]  Hole two with this many strokes, he's going to get crazy.
[07:54.030 --> 07:55.730]  Yeah, he's going to lose his fucking mind.
[07:55.950 --> 07:57.630]  And then it's going to be a nightmare for everybody else.
[07:58.970 --> 07:59.730]  Fuck me!
[08:00.530 --> 08:02.090]  That's the worst thing that could have happened to us.
[08:04.670 --> 08:05.830]  Dude, this is easy.
[08:06.270 --> 08:06.810]  Check this out.
[08:06.810 --> 08:07.710]  This is easy.
[08:08.050 --> 08:09.550]  Easy, baby.
[08:10.630 --> 08:12.170]  Easy, right there.
[08:12.590 --> 08:12.810]  Boom.
[08:14.250 --> 08:16.990]  I didn't realize how lucky I got with that first shot.
[08:17.430 --> 08:18.250]  Neither did I.
[08:21.790 --> 08:22.910]  He missed.
[08:24.070 --> 08:26.310]  Oh, my God.
[08:26.610 --> 08:28.390]  This is spelling disaster for us.
[08:28.630 --> 08:30.450]  This is spelling disaster for us.
[08:30.650 --> 08:32.110]  He's going to kill a lot of you now.
[08:32.510 --> 08:34.770]  It's like watching somebody create the Joker.
[08:35.330 --> 08:36.730]  Look at this, Gavin is winning.
[08:36.850 --> 08:37.990]  Gavin's at minus one.
[08:38.450 --> 08:40.090]  Oh, look at this little easy hole.
[08:41.410 --> 08:43.930]  In the water tower, plop down into the hole.
[08:44.250 --> 08:44.890]  Love it.
[08:45.510 --> 08:47.170]  The ghost train was his vat of acid.
[08:48.630 --> 08:49.390]  Alright, Gavin, you're up.
[08:50.550 --> 08:51.010]  Not quite.
[08:53.730 --> 08:55.130]  That wasn't even close.
[08:55.750 --> 08:56.790]  Alright, John Cena, you're up.
[08:58.690 --> 09:00.890]  Oh, yeah!
[09:02.030 --> 09:04.270]  You couldn't figure out an animation for that, huh?
[09:04.690 --> 09:04.850]  Nope.
[09:05.250 --> 09:05.910]  Hole in one!
[09:07.330 --> 09:08.210]  Very nice.
[09:09.710 --> 09:12.070]  I didn't look at where you put your meter.
[09:13.170 --> 09:15.430]  You can't see where other people put their meter, unfortunately.
[09:18.130 --> 09:19.270]  That would make it real easy.
[09:19.390 --> 09:20.390]  This is where I come back.
[09:21.790 --> 09:22.670]  No way!
[09:23.150 --> 09:23.830]  Yes way.
[09:25.290 --> 09:26.290]  This is it, Andrew.
[09:26.910 --> 09:28.190]  Why is my face this way?
[09:29.150 --> 09:30.590]  Because it doesn't want you to do it again.
[09:30.730 --> 09:31.930]  You want to go that way.
[09:33.250 --> 09:34.290]  Please, sir, don't do it.
[09:34.450 --> 09:35.630]  The game is asking you to stop.
[09:36.490 --> 09:37.510]  Nah, I can try.
[09:38.730 --> 09:41.010]  Hey, remember how everybody makes the first shot look so easy?
[09:43.590 --> 09:43.990]  Oops.
[09:46.730 --> 09:47.770]  You're still in it!
[09:47.970 --> 09:48.610]  You lived!
[09:49.530 --> 09:51.230]  Oh, the prairie dog.
[09:57.000 --> 09:58.020]  You got it.
[09:58.920 --> 09:59.780]  Nailed it.
[09:59.980 --> 10:00.460]  Yay!
[10:03.000 --> 10:03.480]  Nice.
[10:03.720 --> 10:03.920]  Boom.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.280]  Hey!
[10:16.870 --> 10:17.490]  There you go!
[10:21.810 --> 10:23.250]  What's wrong with my spine?
[10:24.510 --> 10:25.770]  In real life or the game?
[10:25.970 --> 10:26.530]  The game.
[10:26.990 --> 10:27.990]  Scoliosis, I think.
[10:30.450 --> 10:32.210]  Can I just go right over that?
[10:32.370 --> 10:32.810]  Like, nothing?
[10:33.150 --> 10:33.350]  Yeah.
[10:33.350 --> 10:36.230]  Oh, my God.
[10:36.250 --> 10:38.310]  Why would you do it with him right there?
[10:38.810 --> 10:41.610]  How do I cancel? Thank you.
[10:42.750 --> 10:43.270]  Now!
[10:49.780 --> 10:51.400]  What's wrong? What's the matter?
[10:51.660 --> 10:52.720]  Real motherfucker.
[10:53.640 --> 10:54.980]  Just go right over it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.760]  You get a shield now to protect from it.
[11:01.760 --> 11:05.200]  Duff beer for me, duff beer for you.
[11:06.580 --> 11:07.920]  Double bogey, sheesh.
[11:08.660 --> 11:09.080]  Surprise.
[11:09.360 --> 11:11.400]  A guy like me would just get it in the hole.
[11:15.480 --> 11:15.960]  Carnival!
[11:17.540 --> 11:18.820]  Okay, going to the carnival.
[11:20.660 --> 11:21.340]  Fuck y'all.
[11:22.800 --> 11:24.020]  Oh, fuck me.
[11:24.900 --> 11:26.220]  Shouldn't have skipped, I guess.
[11:26.560 --> 11:26.960]  Here we go.
[11:27.340 --> 11:29.860]  Andrew, did you play that DLC yet for Alan Wake 2?
[11:29.860 --> 11:31.520]  I finished it. It's very good.
[11:31.980 --> 11:32.420]  Damn.
[11:34.160 --> 11:35.220]  Unlike that shot.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.560]  Oh, and look, you knocked down one of the ducks. That's fun.
[11:38.880 --> 11:40.220]  Oh, you helped. You're helping.
[11:40.260 --> 11:42.320]  Oh, wow. We're all helping each other.
[11:43.160 --> 11:43.720]  Oh, dear.
[11:47.160 --> 11:47.820]  Oh, dear.
[11:52.140 --> 11:53.620]  I let the button go.
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.680]  I let the button go too early.
[11:56.280 --> 11:56.800]  Oh, dear.
[11:57.420 --> 11:57.980]  Oh, dear.
[11:58.240 --> 11:59.620]  Are you just going to be in my way?
[12:00.200 --> 12:01.420]  No, no, no.
[12:02.800 --> 12:03.240]  Please.
[12:03.740 --> 12:05.900]  You are having a laugh, son.
[12:07.100 --> 12:09.860]  Are you shitting the back of my head?
[12:09.960 --> 12:11.120]  What am I doing to this?
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.200]  Oh, wow.
[12:17.360 --> 12:19.880]  The duck scared me and I let the button go too early.
[12:20.040 --> 12:20.540]  I messed up.
[12:30.240 --> 12:32.620]  I don't know. I can't figure out what happened there.
[12:33.680 --> 12:35.980]  Just playing some golf. First time hitting the hole.
[12:47.140 --> 12:47.640]  Great.
[12:51.360 --> 12:53.020]  Alright, Geoff. Whenever you're ready.
[12:55.000 --> 12:55.440]  Great work.
[13:04.810 --> 13:06.370]  Somebody let the balloon go.
[13:06.370 --> 13:07.390]  Just nice and easy.
[13:08.870 --> 13:16.590]  Good. Let's see what this hole is about.
[13:16.950 --> 13:17.490]  You're set.
[13:17.710 --> 13:20.890]  You're perfectly lined up.
[13:21.950 --> 13:23.030]  Don't hit that duck.
[13:24.810 --> 13:27.030]  Now I will say, that wasn't on me.
[13:28.930 --> 13:30.450]  I took my eyes off the meter.
[13:30.770 --> 13:31.750]  I was looking at the ducks.
[13:33.610 --> 13:35.070]  I was looking at the ducks.
[13:38.130 --> 13:39.730]  The meter got away from me a little.
[13:45.930 --> 13:48.010]  My priorities there were power up one,
[13:48.570 --> 13:50.290]  ducks two, golf third.
[13:53.750 --> 13:55.350]  I mean, half the ducks are gone.
[13:55.530 --> 13:56.090]  You'll be fine.
[13:57.370 --> 13:58.850]  Oh, what a shot.
[14:08.740 --> 14:09.940]  Piece of shit.
[14:09.940 --> 14:11.140]  Let's see how we're doing.
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.020]  Yeah, let's see what the score is, Gavin.
[14:13.680 --> 14:15.180]  2-0 to 1-4.
[14:15.440 --> 14:16.140]  It's still good.
[14:19.060 --> 14:20.580]  Eric's currently in the lead.
[14:20.700 --> 14:21.360]  Congratulations, Eric.
[14:22.280 --> 14:23.080]  Oh, bin holes.
[14:23.500 --> 14:24.120]  Mickey Mouse!
[14:25.580 --> 14:25.960]  No.
[14:27.740 --> 14:28.480]  Monkey Moo!
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.580]  There you go.
[14:32.560 --> 14:33.140]  Beans it.
[14:34.760 --> 14:36.260]  Which one do you think is the real hole?
[14:36.700 --> 14:36.860]  That...
[14:38.920 --> 14:39.240]  Okay.
[14:39.720 --> 14:42.000]  I was hoping you'd narrow it down a little bit.
[14:44.600 --> 14:46.500]  Well, it did give you an additional option, at least.
[14:50.780 --> 14:51.080]  Uh-oh.
[14:52.860 --> 14:53.180]  Nice.
[14:57.400 --> 14:58.020]  Pretty good.
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.080]  So it's got to be one of the...
[15:01.080 --> 15:02.540]  It's got to be top left or top right, then, yeah?
[15:03.040 --> 15:03.820]  Yeah, one of the ears.
[15:05.160 --> 15:07.520]  Gavin's not going to go for either one, but it's cool.
[15:07.520 --> 15:08.040]  Oops.
[15:10.400 --> 15:12.160]  I can't tell if he did or not.
[15:13.060 --> 15:13.320]  Hello.
[15:16.100 --> 15:17.660]  That was just not enough beans.
[15:18.040 --> 15:18.340]  Top right.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.380]  Line it up, bud.
[15:22.140 --> 15:23.360]  Working on it, working on it.
[15:25.440 --> 15:26.160]  There it is.
[15:26.320 --> 15:26.660]  That's in.
[15:27.400 --> 15:27.880]  Beautiful.
[15:28.480 --> 15:28.920]  That's it.
[15:31.640 --> 15:33.040]  Second hole in one.
[15:33.540 --> 15:37.280]  Dude, going last on that hole is so...
[15:37.280 --> 15:37.960]  That's crucial.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.420]  That was a lucky break.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.400]  Yeah, that's a good one. Way to go.
[15:44.680 --> 15:45.300]  What you got, Geoff?
[15:45.300 --> 15:46.540]  Putting that top right one's tough.
[15:48.840 --> 15:49.280]  Wow.
[15:50.820 --> 15:52.420]  You can squirt off twice?
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.380]  I think it's because I left the ground for a minute.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.340]  Who's doing what?
[15:58.560 --> 15:59.840]  I squirted off twice.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.260]  I have two fire trails.
[16:01.700 --> 16:02.340]  Oh, I see.
[16:02.380 --> 16:05.000]  Did he use the suck hole or the blow hole for that?
[16:07.920 --> 16:08.720]  Oh, what?
[16:09.340 --> 16:09.960]  That's a birdie.
[16:10.260 --> 16:10.660]  Wow.
[16:11.660 --> 16:14.780]  Daddy, help me.
[16:15.340 --> 16:17.420]  Someone was sucking the moon through a straw, I know what I'm saying.
[16:18.920 --> 16:19.680]  What's this thing?
[16:21.220 --> 16:21.920]  Let's find out.
[16:22.040 --> 16:22.380]  Hit the button.
[16:22.800 --> 16:23.600]  Oil power. Hit it.
[16:26.300 --> 16:27.100]  Not now.
[16:27.820 --> 16:28.220]  You...
[16:30.240 --> 16:31.700]  You fucking dunce.
[16:32.920 --> 16:33.800]  Get the hat.
[16:34.280 --> 16:35.400]  That's right, I wouldn't be able to use it.
[16:37.860 --> 16:38.500]  Oof.
[16:39.600 --> 16:40.640]  God damn it.
[16:42.120 --> 16:43.280]  Daddy would have helped you.
[16:44.260 --> 16:44.520]  What?
[16:47.640 --> 16:49.140]  Get in there.
[16:49.260 --> 16:49.740]  Nailed it.
[16:49.740 --> 16:50.340]  Great par.
[16:52.900 --> 16:56.140]  Gavin, you get a hold exactly where you are. Congratulations.
[17:02.960 --> 17:04.380]  Andrew, a plus two.
[17:04.820 --> 17:06.380]  Andrew's really pulling it back.
[17:06.580 --> 17:08.140]  I'm trying to get there.
[17:08.700 --> 17:09.860]  Oh, do we hit the red thing?
[17:10.040 --> 17:10.760]  Look at this.
[17:11.640 --> 17:13.280]  How bad do you want it?
[17:15.180 --> 17:16.520]  Oh, daddy gets the bullseye.
[17:16.580 --> 17:17.120]  Here we go.
[17:17.440 --> 17:19.040]  Shut up.
[17:20.980 --> 17:21.340]  No!
[17:23.200 --> 17:24.120]  Too many beans.
[17:24.460 --> 17:25.380]  Daddy got the bullseye.
[17:25.500 --> 17:27.480]  I didn't even see it on my screen.
[17:27.500 --> 17:31.100]  Now, here's the thing. You want a little less beans than you think, but not a lot less beans.
[17:31.520 --> 17:33.100]  Been a little longer than daddy thought, apparently.
[17:33.540 --> 17:33.760]  Yeah.
[17:34.460 --> 17:35.180]  Very nice.
[17:35.580 --> 17:36.380]  What just happened there?
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.320]  Oh, wow.
[17:39.880 --> 17:41.440]  What just happened there?
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.300]  You're trying to hit the backboard to go down directly into that hole.
[17:49.140 --> 17:52.040]  So that way you don't miss, I think.
[17:52.600 --> 17:53.960]  So you just need to hit any part of it.
[17:54.680 --> 17:55.520]  Seems like it.
[17:55.760 --> 17:56.020]  Wow.
[17:56.260 --> 17:58.340]  It seems like it activates it.
[17:58.820 --> 18:02.780]  If you don't hit it, it'll put you out the front hole.
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.860]  Andrew's third hole in run.
[18:05.300 --> 18:05.740]  Hole in what?
[18:06.560 --> 18:06.920]  Thanks.
[18:09.640 --> 18:11.880]  Take two, three, two, one.
[18:12.100 --> 18:12.640]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[18:15.360 --> 18:16.480]  See, so it puts you out the other way.
[18:16.480 --> 18:17.500]  Oh, so it knows.
[18:19.140 --> 18:19.860]  It knows.
[18:20.820 --> 18:21.520]  It knows.
[18:24.840 --> 18:26.240]  Oh, it didn't give it to me!
[18:29.580 --> 18:30.820]  Oh, right in front of him!
[18:36.140 --> 18:37.860]  Oh, look at this move.
[18:38.840 --> 18:41.600]  You got yourself all nice and sticky in that grass.
[18:42.660 --> 18:43.840]  The old glue bank.
[18:48.420 --> 18:50.440]  Just coming in a corner alone.
[18:51.960 --> 18:54.440]  That's some golfy specimen coming on the wall.
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.560]  That's what happens when you get three hole in ones.
[19:00.760 --> 19:02.480]  Oh my gosh, there's glue everywhere.
[19:03.920 --> 19:05.360]  Oh no, I'm stuck.
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.840]  Things aren't going Geoff's way in this one.
[19:10.060 --> 19:10.640]  That's true.
[19:10.960 --> 19:13.920]  Geoff's at plus four, Gavin and Eric are tied at zero.
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.220]  Oh, pirate boat!
[19:17.740 --> 19:18.220]  Oh!
[19:19.680 --> 19:20.640]  Oh shit!
[19:20.880 --> 19:22.740]  I hate that ride.
[19:22.900 --> 19:23.700]  I hate that ride.
[19:25.700 --> 19:27.060]  That spinny shit, man.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.040]  Here it comes!
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.780]  I'll go upside down.
[19:31.780 --> 19:32.940]  Whatever, that's cool.
[19:33.180 --> 19:34.100]  Nice, Gavin!
[19:35.840 --> 19:37.200]  Oh, that's a hole in one!
[19:38.220 --> 19:39.260]  It's a hole in one!
[19:40.060 --> 19:42.200]  Spiral me! Get me in there, son!
[19:42.880 --> 19:43.680]  Gavin, it's in the hole.
[19:43.980 --> 19:45.540]  Oh, it's just teasing you right now.
[19:45.800 --> 19:46.740]  Gavin, it's in the hole.
[19:48.220 --> 19:50.040]  Man, this game's great.
[19:50.560 --> 19:51.400]  I love this game.
[19:52.440 --> 19:53.380]  Good job, Gav.
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.140]  Alright, here you go Andrew, it's your turn.
[19:57.740 --> 19:59.000]  These should really all be par ones.
[20:10.400 --> 20:11.960]  How did it go in!
[20:12.240 --> 20:14.160]  It wasn't even aimed.
[20:15.460 --> 20:17.600]  You can call those off I guess.
[20:17.720 --> 20:19.880]  That was all timing, no power, no accuracy.
[20:32.300 --> 20:32.900]  Please...
[20:32.900 --> 20:34.480]  I don't think that was that.
[20:38.400 --> 20:39.000]  Er...
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.340]  It launched out the wrong way.
[20:42.520 --> 20:43.240]  Nice, Eric!
[20:44.480 --> 20:46.000]  It didn't give it to me!
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.260]  Fucking nice beans, dude. It didn't give it to me. That was in into hard. Oh
[20:53.260 --> 20:54.920]  Too much mustard
[20:56.460 --> 21:02.480]  Right left go go go go, but by the time you get it up there like what do you think?
[21:03.900 --> 21:09.580]  Like you know where it's go. Oh, I dumped you on the edge. Oh, that was me. No
[21:10.260 --> 21:12.340]  Let you stay in there bounds
[21:15.720 --> 21:16.200]  Yeah
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.720]  See what it gives you same as Andrew better get out of my way. Let's hope not
[21:25.220 --> 21:31.560]  Nice god, Andrew, you're not supposed to be there. No, I'm not I'm gonna be in the fucking ride and you got a fireball
[21:35.550 --> 21:35.910]  What
[21:39.410 --> 21:43.950]  Don't do that. Did it think you were coming up the ramp? I guess so. That was really
[21:52.090 --> 21:52.530]  a
[21:52.530 --> 21:54.910]  Nose is broken. Oh
[21:54.910 --> 22:00.010]  Just you got a shoot. Oh, but you better just go for the green. Not that way. I mean, what are you doing?
[22:00.510 --> 22:06.770]  Are you what are you thinking getting it back in the ride? No, you got it. Whenever you're ready. Yeah, whatever you're ready
[22:06.770 --> 22:09.390]  Godspeed look perfect way to go
[22:09.390 --> 22:12.510]  Yeah, do that. What that worked it?
[22:13.010 --> 22:14.550]  No, what?
[22:14.550 --> 22:16.410]  What do you mean?
[22:16.870 --> 22:25.730]  It works. No, it didn't. Where's the goddamn hole? It's right around the corner there from the tree. It's on the right side
[22:29.030 --> 22:34.550]  What a fucking nose where the hell is this hole is insane
[22:36.910 --> 22:37.390]  Oh
[22:39.910 --> 22:41.550]  What if we're stuck here forever?
[22:42.690 --> 22:46.630]  Well, why do you get into it? Yeah, I don't know why he's doing that I don't
[22:48.430 --> 22:53.710]  You're just give up on your dream. I just want to see what's in there. There you go. Nice
[22:54.750 --> 22:56.610]  Great bogey. All right. Here you go. Hey
[22:57.950 --> 22:59.830]  Uh-huh. There. There you go
[22:59.830 --> 23:01.890]  There you go there. You're
[23:02.730 --> 23:07.230]  Finally gone. Yeah, I don't know you it took you three strokes to figure that out. I don't know why you said easy
[23:07.910 --> 23:10.830]  Easy peasy shit. Oh my god
[23:18.440 --> 23:18.920]  I
[23:18.920 --> 23:21.660]  We said it in the last one, but I'm so glad no our job
[23:25.500 --> 23:30.220]  I was working it. I'm asleep like a motherfucker today
[23:33.040 --> 23:33.520]  I
[23:37.040 --> 23:42.540]  Want to thank all the listeners out there I want to thank everyone that subscribe to the patreon and watch these videos
[23:43.100 --> 23:44.380]  Thank you so much
[23:46.840 --> 23:48.840]  You want to stand inside the pirate ship
[23:49.840 --> 23:56.180]  Fucking kill this ghost man. I'm gonna see this. No, you got it. Yep. Fuck you, dude
[23:59.740 --> 24:10.280]  You skimmed off his skull that worked way better than I thought you don't look at that. Oh
[24:10.280 --> 24:17.440]  There's a little hole did you see that nice? Yeah oil. Oh gosh. Oh licking it up
[24:18.300 --> 24:20.500]  Well played. Thank you
[24:23.460 --> 24:24.060]  Nice
