[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Okay, cool. Hey Gavin, what are we doing?
[00:01.940 --> 00:05.360]  Hey, it's GTA 4, uh, you're watching me play. This is Niko, what's up?
[00:05.560 --> 00:09.020]  Uh, I've turned all the traffic up... a little bit.
[00:09.340 --> 00:10.380]  I've turned the speed up.
[00:10.580 --> 00:12.200]  What does that mean? Why don't you have any health?
[00:12.840 --> 00:16.320]  Uh, I think I got... a little bit wounded by-
[00:16.320 --> 00:17.040]  OH SHIT!
[00:17.060 --> 00:18.280]  What the fuck was that?!
[00:18.280 --> 00:18.860]  Hold on.
[00:19.300 --> 00:20.800]  Hang on, Packy has something to say!
[00:21.280 --> 00:23.240]  Oh, shut up! I'm- I'm busy! Okay.
[00:23.580 --> 00:25.160]  I can't get out of the fricking door.
[00:25.380 --> 00:25.640]  Alright.
[00:26.920 --> 00:27.640]  Oh god!
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.640]  Oh shit! What's going on?!
[00:29.640 --> 00:31.060]  I'm gonna get out of here! Shit!
[00:31.720 --> 00:33.620]  Uh, the- the traffic, there's something going on.
[00:33.660 --> 00:34.980]  Everything's going really fast.
[00:35.660 --> 00:36.780]  Shit, the bed!
[00:37.620 --> 00:38.940]  Okay, where are we going?
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.000]  I gotta try and-
[00:40.840 --> 00:42.620]  Is this why it's your favorite game?
[00:43.580 --> 00:46.620]  Can you go- can you like go play like a game of darts or something?
[00:46.780 --> 00:48.280]  Oh yeah, yeah. Get all the way to the airport.
[00:48.640 --> 00:50.320]  Yeah, get all the way to the airport. This is good.
[00:50.340 --> 00:52.580]  Alright, I gotta look both ways before crossing the street.
[00:52.800 --> 00:54.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, the name of this video is
[00:54.760 --> 00:56.060]  Gavin Goes to the Airport.
[00:56.320 --> 00:58.420]  And we're gonna see if Gavin can go to the-
[00:58.420 --> 00:59.440]  Oh my god!
[01:00.880 --> 01:01.760]  Holy shit!
[01:02.680 --> 01:02.960]  Okay.
[01:04.580 --> 01:05.680]  You know what?
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.220]  Oh shit!
[01:08.300 --> 01:10.780]  Now I'm starting to understand why Gav doesn't like driving.
[01:11.200 --> 01:11.540]  Yeah.
[01:12.120 --> 01:13.460]  This is how I see the world.
[01:14.080 --> 01:14.960]  Excuse me, fella.
[01:15.520 --> 01:18.780]  So, if you drive, like if you're in a car, does it go this fast?
[01:20.000 --> 01:20.700]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:20.960 --> 01:22.320]  Stop calling me!
[01:22.820 --> 01:23.960]  Why are you answering?
[01:24.120 --> 01:25.140]  Why don't you just ignore it?
[01:25.140 --> 01:26.880]  Because I gotta hit A to run
[01:26.880 --> 01:28.680]  and it's also on to the phone really fast.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.440]  Let's go bowling!
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.280]  No, no, no, no, no!
[01:31.440 --> 01:33.100]  You don't have any health!
[01:33.680 --> 01:35.340]  I need to find health.
[01:35.840 --> 01:37.120]  There's a car there briefly!
[01:37.600 --> 01:37.700]  Shit!
[01:40.000 --> 01:40.220]  Alright.
[01:46.200 --> 01:46.760]  Oh, there's a car.
[01:47.040 --> 01:47.460]  Can I take this?
[01:47.460 --> 01:48.620]  Okay, okay, okay.
[01:49.100 --> 01:50.200]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.280]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:51.400 --> 01:51.640]  Okay.
[01:55.280 --> 01:55.880]  Okay.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.500]  This is what Gus told me
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.120]  about if a plane
[02:12.120 --> 02:14.300]  crashes. It takes a lot longer
[02:14.300 --> 02:15.080]  than you think.
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.380]  That was... what the fuck?
[02:18.380 --> 02:20.760]  Okay, not a great first run.
[02:20.920 --> 02:23.020]  No, no, no, but it's because you didn't have any health.
[02:23.660 --> 02:24.840]  Right, now I've got full health.
[02:25.140 --> 02:25.360]  Yeah.
[02:25.740 --> 02:27.240]  And I'm at the hospital.
[02:30.040 --> 02:30.480]  Okay.
[02:32.440 --> 02:34.220]  And look both ways. Let's go!
[02:38.460 --> 02:40.040]  It's like a quiet place, day one.
[02:41.780 --> 02:42.220]  Okay.
[02:46.480 --> 02:47.200]  Oh, shit!
[02:49.700 --> 02:50.780]  This might be a one.
[02:52.220 --> 02:53.780]  This is crazy.
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.100]  Guys, I don't think
[02:56.100 --> 02:57.220]  I'm going to make it to...
[02:57.220 --> 02:58.880]  I don't think I'm going to make it to the airport.
[03:00.440 --> 03:02.120]  What is it turned up to?
[03:03.300 --> 03:04.420]  Uh, nine, nine, nine,
[03:04.480 --> 03:04.860]  nine, nine.
[03:05.660 --> 03:06.380]  The max.
[03:08.560 --> 03:10.120]  You have a flight to catch, Gavin. Come on.
[03:10.900 --> 03:11.320]  Whew.
[03:13.240 --> 03:13.660]  Okay.
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.280]  Alright. You got this, buddy.
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.840]  You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it, you got it.
[03:18.060 --> 03:18.780]  This is easy.
[03:20.020 --> 03:21.420]  Oh, shit! Dude!
[03:22.300 --> 03:22.940]  Damn shit!
[03:23.320 --> 03:25.760]  Okay, you know what would be...
[03:25.760 --> 03:27.180]  I don't know that that's a great...
[03:27.180 --> 03:27.440]  Oh!
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.420]  Oh my god.
[03:30.640 --> 03:31.660]  I got reset a little bit.
[03:31.860 --> 03:32.160]  Oh!
[03:34.720 --> 03:35.140]  Oh!
[03:37.060 --> 03:37.420]  Oh!
[03:38.620 --> 03:38.980]  Oh!
[03:40.940 --> 03:41.300]  Oh!
[03:42.520 --> 03:42.880]  Oh!
[03:43.420 --> 03:45.000]  I should have peed before we did this.
[03:45.460 --> 03:45.660]  Oh!
[03:48.280 --> 03:48.640]  Oh!
[03:49.440 --> 03:50.820]  I need to, like, slow down
[03:50.820 --> 03:51.820]  so it resets me.
[03:52.060 --> 03:55.120]  I wonder what it would be like to take a cab
[03:55.120 --> 03:55.540]  in this.
[03:56.300 --> 03:57.660]  Oh, should I try and call a cab?
[04:02.260 --> 04:03.820]  How do you call a cab in this game?
[04:03.820 --> 04:04.540]  I have no idea.
[04:05.440 --> 04:06.940]  Let me see if I can just whistle.
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.840]  Oh my god.
[04:10.060 --> 04:11.780]  Oh! I whistled for a cab!
[04:12.040 --> 04:12.520]  Oh, there you go!
[04:12.900 --> 04:17.420]  It went over the roof.
[04:18.640 --> 04:20.100]  Alright, I'm gonna keep whistling.
[04:20.960 --> 04:21.440]  That was one.
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.760]  Cab! Cab!
[04:26.920 --> 04:27.380]  Cab!
[04:28.280 --> 04:29.660]  Cabs, please! Please!
[04:30.320 --> 04:31.900]  One of them! One of them!
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.400]  Hello?
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.600]  Oh, shit!
[04:36.980 --> 04:38.020]  That's my cab!
[04:38.520 --> 04:39.240]  That's my cab!
[04:39.880 --> 04:40.940]  It's in the sky!
[04:42.620 --> 04:43.900]  It's raining cabs!
[04:45.040 --> 04:45.600]  Okay.
[04:46.420 --> 04:46.980]  Alright.
[04:47.260 --> 04:49.020]  Alright, you got this, Gavin.
[04:49.840 --> 04:51.480]  Oh my god!
[04:51.760 --> 04:53.980]  That was cool, man. You almost got across the street.
[04:54.120 --> 04:55.620]  You're getting closer. I'm getting there.
[04:58.420 --> 04:58.980]  Okay.
[04:58.980 --> 04:59.700]  Alright.
[05:00.880 --> 05:02.360]  This is your run, right here.
[05:03.000 --> 05:03.180]  Okay.
[05:04.780 --> 05:05.220]  Golden.
[05:07.420 --> 05:08.000]  Nice job.
[05:08.420 --> 05:11.200]  If I stayed at the side of the road,
[05:12.340 --> 05:13.620]  I'm more likely to make it.
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.800]  You wanna be under the awning in the rain anyway.
[05:15.920 --> 05:16.660]  You don't wanna get soggy.
[05:19.200 --> 05:19.900]  Nailed it!
[05:21.160 --> 05:21.600]  Gavin!
[05:21.860 --> 05:24.300]  This is the worst game of Frogger I've ever seen.
[05:24.880 --> 05:25.980]  This is Extreme Frogger.
[05:25.980 --> 05:27.140]  Hello, love.
[05:28.960 --> 05:30.420]  Is that a cab?
[05:30.920 --> 05:31.440]  Jesus!
[05:31.780 --> 05:32.200]  Oh no!
[05:33.840 --> 05:36.080]  Dude, you just did the
[05:36.080 --> 05:37.860]  Michael Jackson smooth criminal there.
[05:37.940 --> 05:38.960]  That was fucking awesome.
[05:42.400 --> 05:42.960]  Okay.
[05:43.300 --> 05:44.700]  There's gotta be...
[05:46.320 --> 05:47.560]  There's some money.
[05:47.920 --> 05:49.100]  There's some money for your trouble.
[05:51.820 --> 05:53.100]  Is there a car right there?
[05:53.620 --> 05:54.280]  There's a car.
[05:54.920 --> 05:55.740]  I gotta get in the car.
[05:56.080 --> 05:58.320]  That's the worst joke I've ever seen in my life.
[05:59.000 --> 06:00.860]  Wait, that might be a van you can take.
[06:01.480 --> 06:02.740]  Yeah, but look how messed up it is.
[06:02.920 --> 06:03.900]  Oh, there's a helicopter!
[06:04.480 --> 06:04.820]  Oh!
[06:06.460 --> 06:08.620]  Shit, everyone's dying. I can't help.
[06:08.720 --> 06:10.300]  Oh no!
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.840]  I got hit by like a mailbox or something.
[06:12.860 --> 06:14.760]  This is what happens. You can't stay still.
[06:14.840 --> 06:15.660]  You gotta keep moving.
[06:16.300 --> 06:17.880]  I'm gonna take cover in this.
[06:18.220 --> 06:19.060]  Let me in!
[06:19.060 --> 06:20.300]  Let me in!
[06:21.960 --> 06:22.880]  I'm wedged.
[06:23.140 --> 06:24.300]  Get off the wall!
[06:24.760 --> 06:25.760]  Get off the silly wall!
[06:26.840 --> 06:27.880]  Hot potatoes!
[06:30.140 --> 06:30.660]  Jesus!
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.280]  Jesus, stop it!
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.240]  Don't be afraid to action roll.
[06:36.720 --> 06:39.000]  There's a cab on the ceiling.
[06:41.200 --> 06:43.180]  How close to the airport do you think you were there?
[06:43.560 --> 06:45.120]  All I need to do is get near
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.260]  to the next hospital.
[06:46.260 --> 06:47.640]  And then I'll start there, won't I?
[06:48.560 --> 06:48.980]  Alright.
[06:49.980 --> 06:52.260]  Is there a car over...
[06:55.880 --> 06:57.340]  Yes! Where was that?
[06:57.580 --> 06:58.220]  Where did that land?
[06:59.820 --> 07:00.340]  Uh oh.
[07:01.500 --> 07:03.820]  Maybe run through some back alleys
[07:03.820 --> 07:04.780]  and see if you can find a car.
[07:07.980 --> 07:08.520]  Excuse me.
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.640]  The Hummer!
[07:11.360 --> 07:12.240]  Yes! No!
[07:12.240 --> 07:12.760]  No!
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.500]  I'm going this way now.
[07:19.780 --> 07:20.540]  It's safer.
[07:21.600 --> 07:24.180]  Running down a hill is safe. Everything behind me will just be in the air.
[07:24.800 --> 07:25.960]  There's a jeep, dude.
[07:26.420 --> 07:26.660]  Where?
[07:26.960 --> 07:29.540]  Under the bridge. To your right.
[07:29.880 --> 07:30.540]  To your right.
[07:33.260 --> 07:35.920]  It was right over there.
[07:37.060 --> 07:37.960]  Just off the screen.
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.400]  Holy shit.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.740]  Oh my god.
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.700]  Do you think this is why we don't have flying cars?
[07:47.100 --> 07:47.560]  I mean...
[07:47.560 --> 07:48.180]  Yeah, this is why.
[07:48.860 --> 07:49.820]  They'll never find me up here.
[07:50.080 --> 07:50.700]  Yes, they will!
[07:54.080 --> 07:55.480]  What you should do
[07:55.480 --> 07:57.480]  is take...
[07:57.480 --> 07:58.260]  see where the
[07:59.060 --> 08:00.280]  metro here takes you.
[08:01.820 --> 08:03.300]  And see if it
[08:03.300 --> 08:04.220]  puts you somewhere closer.
[08:05.380 --> 08:06.740]  That's why you use public transportation.
[08:06.740 --> 08:07.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:09.080 --> 08:10.020]  Oh yes! Train!
[08:11.120 --> 08:12.660]  Oh god. What if you die by a train?
[08:12.940 --> 08:13.840]  No, no. You're good. You got it.
[08:15.140 --> 08:17.380]  There you go. Wait for it to open here.
[08:18.260 --> 08:18.760]  How do I board?
[08:18.980 --> 08:20.160]  Do you have exact change?
[08:20.280 --> 08:21.900]  Now it's hit Y. There you go.
[08:22.580 --> 08:23.420]  Now wait a minute.
[08:24.060 --> 08:25.260]  And we'll see where it takes you.
[08:27.380 --> 08:28.080]  Go ahead and hit.
[08:29.180 --> 08:29.860]  For what?
[08:32.120 --> 08:32.460]  Alright.
[08:32.580 --> 08:34.600]  We're at Frankfort High Station.
[08:35.880 --> 08:36.740]  And we're off.
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.060]  Why do you have a wand at that point?
[08:38.440 --> 08:40.000]  I don't know. I think maybe...
[08:40.680 --> 08:42.060]  Oh my god!
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.640]  This is awesome!
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.420]  Oh dear.
[08:48.640 --> 08:50.160]  Watching the cars fly rocks.
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.360]  This is so cool.
[08:53.580 --> 08:54.540]  It's so peaceful
[08:54.540 --> 08:55.640]  here under the ground.
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.580]  You can hit A to skip it, but I'm so curious
[08:58.580 --> 08:59.400]  to see what the traffic is like.
[09:00.600 --> 09:02.380]  I wouldn't skip one single second.
[09:02.380 --> 09:03.380]  I don't know where this is going to put you.
[09:03.620 --> 09:06.320]  I assume closer to where we want to be, but I really don't know.
[09:06.340 --> 09:07.520]  I think it's taking me the right way.
[09:07.940 --> 09:10.380]  Oh, it's an underground station.
[09:10.560 --> 09:11.320]  Alright, let me check the map.
[09:12.040 --> 09:13.940]  So it's going to be taking us...
[09:13.940 --> 09:15.640]  I mean, it's here, right?
[09:15.980 --> 09:17.900]  So you want to go east.
[09:18.040 --> 09:20.920]  This is easy. It's east and then south and then east again, dude.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.760]  Look at the Manhunt screenshot.
[09:24.000 --> 09:24.400]  It's pretty cool.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.740]  Just go ahead and go up the stairs
[09:27.740 --> 09:29.880]  and then it's game time, dude.
[09:29.880 --> 09:32.320]  I wonder if these guys know what's going on up there.
[09:32.800 --> 09:33.920]  They're going to find out.
[09:34.220 --> 09:35.880]  Oops, pardon me.
[09:40.730 --> 09:42.050]  Okay, everything's good here.
[09:42.230 --> 09:43.330]  We're doing good so far.
[09:43.550 --> 09:44.390]  Looking good.
[09:44.710 --> 09:46.130]  Sounds normal up there.
[09:47.470 --> 09:48.430]  Sounds fine.
[09:49.490 --> 09:52.110]  Why do you keep taking the corners
[09:52.110 --> 09:53.470]  like something's going to grab you?
[09:54.170 --> 09:55.130]  I'm scared.
[09:57.690 --> 09:58.170]  Why?
[09:58.570 --> 09:59.690]  It's not like the car's going to bite.
[10:00.550 --> 10:01.690]  Oh my god.
[10:02.810 --> 10:03.530]  This is like
[10:04.950 --> 10:05.430]  Cloverfield.
[10:05.590 --> 10:06.490]  It is.
[10:07.450 --> 10:08.410]  Keep going.
[10:11.030 --> 10:11.990]  Oh, shit.
[10:12.450 --> 10:13.110]  Oh, shit.
[10:13.630 --> 10:14.790]  Oh, shit.
[10:15.430 --> 10:17.410]  Run, dude. Get out of there.
[10:17.690 --> 10:18.510]  Get out of there.
[10:22.530 --> 10:23.910]  Gavin, you can't stay still.
[10:23.970 --> 10:24.850]  You've got to move, dude.
[10:25.170 --> 10:26.130]  You've got to get out of here.
[10:26.550 --> 10:28.430]  Gavin, look to your left.
[10:28.530 --> 10:30.230]  There's a park. If you can get over that fence,
[10:30.330 --> 10:30.910]  you're in the park.
[10:36.510 --> 10:37.590]  Don't worry about him.
[10:38.890 --> 10:39.770]  Yeah, you can't save him.
[10:40.070 --> 10:41.190]  Yeah, he landed here.
[10:42.130 --> 10:43.230]  It's too late for him.
[10:43.870 --> 10:45.990]  Sometimes there's just stuff where you don't expect it.
[10:46.210 --> 10:47.610]  Yeah, so this is good.
[10:47.650 --> 10:49.450]  You want to go south on this for a while,
[10:49.590 --> 10:51.610]  and then you're going to find your east pretty soon.
[10:52.350 --> 10:54.010]  You just keep going south, though.
[10:54.010 --> 10:55.330]  Right.
[10:55.910 --> 10:57.830]  Oh, my God.
[10:57.850 --> 10:58.830]  Look at all these people.
[10:59.290 --> 11:02.490]  Oh, God.
[11:08.870 --> 11:11.070]  You might want to check your map.
[11:11.350 --> 11:12.990]  Oh, God.
[11:15.550 --> 11:17.310]  What the hell happened to me there?
[11:19.070 --> 11:19.750]  Okay.
[11:20.590 --> 11:21.110]  We're fine.
[11:21.470 --> 11:24.050]  Gavin, that might be the bridge you need to take.
[11:24.850 --> 11:25.510]  What do you mean?
[11:26.190 --> 11:26.890]  Check your map.
[11:29.630 --> 11:30.350]  Oh, wow.
[11:30.510 --> 11:31.870]  You need to go way south.
[11:32.830 --> 11:35.450]  Yeah, you just need to run.
[11:35.630 --> 11:36.770]  Is that a car right there that you can take?
[11:37.090 --> 11:38.350]  Look how smashed up it is.
[11:38.410 --> 11:38.910]  It's pretty beat up.
[11:44.030 --> 11:45.150]  There's a car over there.
[11:45.530 --> 11:47.690]  Oh, is that a parked one?
[11:47.990 --> 11:48.190]  Yeah.
[11:48.970 --> 11:49.570]  Okay.
[11:49.990 --> 11:51.770]  You gotta make the move.
[11:53.430 --> 11:54.030]  Okay.
[11:57.930 --> 11:59.890]  Look at the size of this road.
[12:00.090 --> 12:00.830]  You got it.
[12:01.090 --> 12:04.550]  Go, go, go!
[12:05.010 --> 12:07.170]  Oh, you should have actually...
[12:07.170 --> 12:07.570]  Gavin!
[12:08.890 --> 12:09.990]  That was my fault.
[12:11.270 --> 12:11.870]  Yes.
[12:12.070 --> 12:13.410]  That was wet.
[12:16.230 --> 12:16.910]  Same hospital.
[12:17.170 --> 12:17.690]  Goddamn it.
[12:19.010 --> 12:19.350]  Alright.
[12:19.430 --> 12:20.730]  I'll get lucky with a car again.
[12:21.110 --> 12:21.230]  Yeah.
[12:23.970 --> 12:25.190]  Well, there's no cars right now.
[12:25.250 --> 12:25.830]  I think you're good.
[12:26.110 --> 12:26.590]  Oh, never mind.
[12:26.790 --> 12:27.910]  Oh, shit.
[12:33.170 --> 12:35.110]  Oh, I wonder if I can just call the police.
[12:36.050 --> 12:36.690]  To do what?
[12:37.690 --> 12:38.910]  Just dial 9-1-1.
[12:39.270 --> 12:40.550]  All you have to do is dial 9-1-1.
[12:42.210 --> 12:43.110]  How do I dial?
[12:43.630 --> 12:44.730]  You open the phone.
[12:45.130 --> 12:45.890]  There you go.
[12:45.950 --> 12:47.290]  And then 9-1-1.
[12:48.050 --> 12:51.930]  It's like one of those TikToks where they show a Gen Z kid a rotary phone.
[12:52.130 --> 12:52.230]  Yeah.
[12:55.990 --> 12:57.170]  I think you have to hit 1.
[12:59.810 --> 13:00.710]  I'll take a firetruck.
[13:00.950 --> 13:01.290]  Oh, okay.
[13:02.570 --> 13:03.310]  Whoops, whoops.
[13:05.530 --> 13:06.550]  Let's see if...
[13:07.710 --> 13:08.990]  Remember to get behind that pillar.
[13:08.990 --> 13:10.730]  No, don't listen to Nick.
[13:10.790 --> 13:11.610]  He wants you to get hurt.
[13:13.250 --> 13:15.050]  I don't think this is...
[13:15.050 --> 13:16.110]  Oh, there it goes!
[13:16.110 --> 13:17.330]  There it goes!
[13:18.650 --> 13:20.230]  Wait, is it in the sky?
[13:20.530 --> 13:21.490]  Is it stuck?
[13:22.490 --> 13:25.530]  Do you have a sniper rifle or something that you can look at it?
[13:32.310 --> 13:33.410]  You're gonna have to get in the...
[13:33.970 --> 13:35.310]  Oh, no!
[13:37.470 --> 13:38.330]  Oh, dear!
[13:38.810 --> 13:39.610]  The irony!
[13:41.790 --> 13:42.830]  Well...
[13:43.510 --> 13:44.030]  Alright.
[13:45.130 --> 13:46.250]  That didn't work.
[13:46.850 --> 13:47.370]  Oh!
[13:53.340 --> 13:55.140]  Oh, God.
[13:56.540 --> 13:58.320]  That didn't work.
[14:02.520 --> 14:04.780]  As if to add insult to injury.
[14:05.560 --> 14:06.920]  Just need one of these to land.
[14:07.500 --> 14:07.740]  Land!
[14:08.780 --> 14:10.100]  Oh, my God!
[14:12.360 --> 14:12.880]  Oh, my God!
[14:12.880 --> 14:14.300]  One of them's gotta...
[14:14.300 --> 14:15.680]  Just come to a stop.
[14:15.940 --> 14:17.040]  Or something. Like this one.
[14:19.360 --> 14:22.420]  The random screams that just fly by.
[14:22.720 --> 14:23.560]  Oh, my God!
[14:26.180 --> 14:27.280]  No, keep running!
[14:28.820 --> 14:29.240]  Okay.
[14:30.180 --> 14:31.940]  There's cars! Cars are parking!
[14:32.180 --> 14:32.980]  What, you don't reverse?
[14:34.500 --> 14:35.020]  Jesus!
[14:35.020 --> 14:35.660]  Jesus!
[14:39.260 --> 14:40.980]  Sometimes people can crash and die.
[14:41.080 --> 14:42.220]  I think maybe that's the answer.
[14:42.320 --> 14:43.840]  Oh, there you go. That black car looks good.
[14:43.840 --> 14:45.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That car looks good.
[14:46.260 --> 14:49.040]  It's on fire! It's on fire! Get away from it!
[14:49.320 --> 14:49.940]  This car looks good.
[14:50.980 --> 14:51.740]  Let me in!
[14:52.060 --> 14:52.580]  It's stuck!
[14:55.460 --> 14:58.080]  I'm thinking maybe I can just get in the cab as a passenger.
[14:58.340 --> 14:59.000]  Oh, yeah!
[14:59.440 --> 14:59.800]  Hit the button.
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.120]  Nothing? Won't let you?
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.320]  Oh, God, no!
[15:03.260 --> 15:04.540]  Oh, he's gone.
[15:05.920 --> 15:08.500]  He just backed to the future.
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.340]  Yeah, he did.
[15:09.580 --> 15:12.180]  Where the God damn is a parked car?
[15:15.120 --> 15:16.220]  Oh, there's one!
[15:16.380 --> 15:17.800]  Go in for it!
[15:18.060 --> 15:18.740]  No, no, no!
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.920]  Okay, there you go. Get in there.
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.240]  Turn to the right. Go through that parking lot.
[15:31.600 --> 15:33.000]  There's gotta be trucks in there, right?
[15:37.000 --> 15:37.400]  Alright.
[15:38.860 --> 15:40.280]  Maybe with a second action roll better.
[15:41.780 --> 15:42.920]  How do you...
[15:44.160 --> 15:44.940]  It's not great.
[15:45.280 --> 15:45.480]  Oh!
[15:48.780 --> 15:51.120]  There's definitely gonna be one trapped here somewhere.
[15:52.160 --> 15:52.440]  Yeah.
[15:52.520 --> 15:53.600]  If it hasn't been taken out.
[15:54.540 --> 15:55.100]  Alright, I'll be back.
[15:55.100 --> 15:55.820]  Cheers, God.
[15:57.960 --> 15:58.560]  Oh, look!
[15:59.900 --> 16:00.820]  You see that?
[16:00.980 --> 16:01.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[16:02.040 --> 16:03.980]  That's the one.
[16:11.600 --> 16:12.800]  You got it right here, dude.
[16:12.820 --> 16:13.300]  You got it.
[16:14.220 --> 16:16.220]  Yes! Jump in, dude.
[16:16.260 --> 16:17.380]  This is it. You're good.
[16:17.960 --> 16:20.160]  I'm just gonna lightly tap the...
[16:20.160 --> 16:22.660]  I think you're gonna drive normal.
[16:23.140 --> 16:23.800]  Yeah, you'll be fine.
[16:25.780 --> 16:26.340]  Just remember,
[16:26.420 --> 16:28.180]  the physics are wonky, so take it nice and easy.
[16:28.180 --> 16:30.220]  Yep. See, I think you drive normal.
[16:30.460 --> 16:30.680]  Oh!
[16:31.620 --> 16:32.060]  Oh!
[16:34.700 --> 16:35.800]  Somebody help me!
[16:35.980 --> 16:36.380]  Help!
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.700]  Okay, if I get down to the ground,
[16:39.880 --> 16:41.500]  I can get out.
[16:42.660 --> 16:43.100]  Shit!
[16:44.960 --> 16:45.400]  Oh!
[16:50.970 --> 16:52.450]  Okay, so I wonder if
[16:52.450 --> 16:54.490]  I just get locked at the speed
[16:54.490 --> 16:55.130]  that I'm at.
[16:56.050 --> 16:56.730]  Oh, different hospital.
[16:57.570 --> 16:58.170]  Oh!
[16:58.190 --> 16:58.910]  Oh, no!
[16:59.390 --> 17:02.830]  A much more dangerous hospital.
[17:06.710 --> 17:08.750]  Let me just stop and take in my surroundings.
[17:09.050 --> 17:09.710]  Never mind.
[17:10.770 --> 17:12.230]  Are you further away?
[17:13.010 --> 17:13.790]  I don't know.
[17:14.170 --> 17:15.490]  Oh, car across street!
[17:16.090 --> 17:18.070]  Go, run, run, run!
[17:18.890 --> 17:19.070]  No!
[17:19.510 --> 17:22.630]  I got snatched right from my hands!
[17:25.030 --> 17:25.630]  Alright.
[17:25.630 --> 17:27.630]  It got taken!
[17:27.910 --> 17:29.510]  It got taken like somebody
[17:29.510 --> 17:30.870]  in the quiet place.
[17:31.030 --> 17:33.510]  I know, it just got snatched.
[17:35.010 --> 17:35.390]  Alright.
[17:36.050 --> 17:37.690]  These aren't going too fast.
[17:39.610 --> 17:39.970]  Well...
[17:40.330 --> 17:40.550]  Oh!
[17:41.850 --> 17:42.570]  Alright.
[17:43.330 --> 17:44.190]  Oh, there you go.
[17:45.310 --> 17:45.650]  Oh!
[17:54.300 --> 17:56.200]  I was in cover!
[17:56.320 --> 17:58.600]  We found out if Gavin drives a car,
[17:58.600 --> 18:00.860]  it has the same physics as all of the others.
[18:00.860 --> 18:02.220]  Oh, there's one over there!
[18:02.320 --> 18:03.320]  There it is!
[18:03.780 --> 18:04.340]  No!
[18:13.120 --> 18:14.520]  Why did everyone
[18:14.520 --> 18:16.060]  suddenly want that car?
[18:16.680 --> 18:18.660]  Every car in the world targeted you!
[18:22.940 --> 18:25.680]  I didn't even make it to spawn that time!
[18:27.180 --> 18:27.700]  Ah!
[18:28.020 --> 18:28.140]  Ah!
[18:29.160 --> 18:30.800]  I just want to go to the airport!
[18:31.840 --> 18:32.880]  Oh, Christ!
[18:33.640 --> 18:33.900]  Alright.
[18:35.440 --> 18:35.960]  Alright.
[18:36.600 --> 18:37.920]  Let's give it a few more goes.
[18:38.760 --> 18:39.920]  Just gotta get up on that bridge.
[18:44.910 --> 18:45.390]  Oh!
[18:46.530 --> 18:47.050]  Shit!
[18:48.390 --> 18:49.410]  You're fine, you're fine.
[18:50.310 --> 18:51.350]  You're not fine.
[18:52.150 --> 18:52.350]  Oh!
[18:53.930 --> 18:54.450]  Dude!
[18:55.930 --> 18:56.570]  That was...
[18:57.850 --> 18:58.710]  How close are we?
[18:59.090 --> 19:00.030]  We gotta be getting there.
[19:00.110 --> 19:01.050]  You gotta be inches.
[19:01.970 --> 19:03.270]  It's like a game of inches now.
[19:04.370 --> 19:05.450]  Oh yeah, way closer.
[19:06.010 --> 19:07.470]  I just gotta get up on that bridge.
[19:07.770 --> 19:09.010]  Yeah, that's all you gotta do.
[19:09.110 --> 19:10.550]  And then once you're there, dude, it's so easy.
[19:11.310 --> 19:13.130]  I feel like there's gonna be a footbridge pop.
[19:13.310 --> 19:14.590]  Oh, there we go!
[19:15.970 --> 19:15.990]  Alright.
[19:18.330 --> 19:18.910]  Nice and easy.
[19:18.990 --> 19:20.750]  I'm just gonna tap the accelerator.
[19:20.750 --> 19:21.330]  Oh!
[19:22.210 --> 19:23.090]  I've tapped it.
[19:23.810 --> 19:26.270]  Okay, tap it just a little bit more.
[19:26.550 --> 19:27.870]  You're gonna have to give it a little tap.
[19:28.150 --> 19:29.590]  A little bit more.
[19:29.770 --> 19:31.130]  Just a little.
[19:31.450 --> 19:33.890]  Hands at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock.
[19:34.210 --> 19:36.370]  Now look left and right.
[19:36.670 --> 19:38.330]  There's gonna be cars coming.
[19:38.870 --> 19:40.250]  Gavin, you have to get out of here!
[19:40.610 --> 19:41.530]  We don't have the luxury, Gavin.
[19:41.870 --> 19:42.270]  No!
[19:44.890 --> 19:46.270]  Is this the right way?
[19:47.110 --> 19:47.910]  Oh no!
[19:47.910 --> 19:49.030]  Get out, get out, get out!
[19:49.030 --> 19:50.650]  It's gonna blow before I land!
[19:51.370 --> 19:51.990]  Hey, you got an accomplishment!
[19:57.070 --> 19:58.990]  This might put you at the airport.
[19:59.310 --> 20:00.590]  This might put you at the airport.
[20:02.190 --> 20:02.970]  You're so close.
[20:02.970 --> 20:04.030]  I might get hit by a plane.
[20:05.270 --> 20:06.290]  You're so close.
[20:07.350 --> 20:08.510]  Oh my god!
[20:09.470 --> 20:11.230]  Oh no, oh no, oh no.
[20:11.650 --> 20:12.790]  Oh, you're alive!
[20:13.030 --> 20:13.550]  You're alive!
[20:13.550 --> 20:14.810]  You're alive!
[20:15.230 --> 20:17.270]  Oh my god, I've landed it.
[20:17.970 --> 20:18.930]  This is great.
[20:19.630 --> 20:20.690]  This is phenomenal.
[20:21.290 --> 20:23.310]  This is incredible. So where did it put you?
[20:26.250 --> 20:27.210]  Oh my god.
[20:27.770 --> 20:29.570]  Okay, so that's the bridge
[20:29.570 --> 20:30.750]  that you have to cross.
[20:31.050 --> 20:31.690]  Should you swim?
[20:32.530 --> 20:34.710]  I don't know if I wanna swim, that was a boat.
[20:36.390 --> 20:37.570]  I think you gotta swim
[20:37.570 --> 20:38.530]  across to get closer.
[20:39.050 --> 20:40.070]  Do you think?
[20:40.070 --> 20:41.050]  Do you wanna swim?
[20:41.590 --> 20:42.910]  Yeah, I think that's the move.
[20:44.030 --> 20:45.210]  I think it's your best bet.
[20:45.750 --> 20:46.910]  It is, definitely.
[20:48.010 --> 20:50.290]  I think you're definitely safest in the water.
[20:56.650 --> 20:57.830]  It's real wavy.
[20:58.150 --> 20:59.370]  It is so wavy.
[20:59.690 --> 21:02.250]  On the bright side, all the boats seem to be above the water,
[21:02.350 --> 21:02.830]  not in it.
[21:03.510 --> 21:05.550]  Especially that one. Where did that one land?
[21:07.590 --> 21:08.710]  I think if you go...
[21:08.710 --> 21:09.050]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:09.150 --> 21:11.030]  Dead ahead, I think you go up that way.
[21:11.350 --> 21:12.730]  I think you're so close, dude.
[21:12.750 --> 21:13.770]  You're almost to the airport.
[21:15.470 --> 21:16.550]  This is great.
[21:17.050 --> 21:19.590]  You cross the bridge, no turmoil.
[21:20.150 --> 21:20.990]  This guy in front...
[21:20.990 --> 21:22.590]  These two guys in front of you, real smart,
[21:22.770 --> 21:23.750]  staying away from traffic.
[21:25.310 --> 21:26.670]  Not a care in the world.
[21:28.910 --> 21:30.030]  When you die,
[21:30.070 --> 21:31.310]  not if, when you die,
[21:31.770 --> 21:33.390]  it'll be on an even closer hospital.
[21:34.010 --> 21:35.210]  I wonder what even happens
[21:35.210 --> 21:37.870]  if you have a five-star wanted level at this speed.
[21:38.150 --> 21:39.630]  Can anyone even get anywhere near you?
[21:39.890 --> 21:40.310]  Yeah, right?
[21:40.430 --> 21:42.470]  Oh, that's a great question.
[21:43.610 --> 21:44.770]  Is that car flying?
[21:45.770 --> 21:47.430]  I think the only thing would be helicopters
[21:47.430 --> 21:48.990]  that you'd have to watch out for,
[21:49.070 --> 21:50.470]  because I don't think they operate the same way.
[21:50.850 --> 21:52.510]  Oh, my God.
[21:53.490 --> 21:55.010]  Okay, yeah, yeah, you gotta go up there.
[21:55.330 --> 21:55.970]  Yeah, there you go.
[21:56.930 --> 21:58.770]  Oh, God. Did one come down it?
[21:59.030 --> 21:59.270]  Yeah.
[21:59.270 --> 21:59.750]  Yeah.
[22:01.090 --> 22:01.910]  Nowhere is safe.
[22:04.110 --> 22:05.450]  Pepper's dead from a car accident.
[22:05.970 --> 22:07.750]  Alright, you gotta make a run for it.
[22:07.890 --> 22:08.870]  There you go. Hop up,
[22:09.030 --> 22:10.670]  and then you gotta make a run for it.
[22:11.450 --> 22:11.610]  Yeah.
[22:12.730 --> 22:14.890]  Alright, all the way up. Here we go. Ready?
[22:15.730 --> 22:16.990]  Alright, get to that wall.
[22:17.130 --> 22:18.010]  Get to that wall.
[22:20.070 --> 22:21.290]  Yeah, just jump over it.
[22:21.690 --> 22:23.310]  Get over it. Get on the other side of the wall.
[22:23.490 --> 22:24.530]  This is a main road?
[22:26.330 --> 22:27.250]  Everyone's safe over here.
[22:27.250 --> 22:27.670]  Alright.
[22:29.530 --> 22:30.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're good.
[22:30.770 --> 22:32.710]  There you go. Move, dude.
[22:35.490 --> 22:37.530]  Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
[22:37.770 --> 22:37.950]  Oh, God.
[22:38.790 --> 22:40.310]  No, no, no. It's to the right.
[22:41.890 --> 22:43.550]  That's where you just went. There you go.
[22:44.070 --> 22:44.770]  Okay, this is good.
[22:45.290 --> 22:46.970]  Is that the airport? Yeah.
[22:48.630 --> 22:49.110]  Let's see.
[22:50.170 --> 22:51.270]  No, I've got a ways to go.
[22:52.550 --> 22:53.230]  Man, wow.
[22:53.730 --> 22:55.090]  I'm not gonna be able to cross this.
[22:55.090 --> 22:55.490]  Bro.
[22:56.710 --> 22:57.150]  Jeez.
[23:00.410 --> 23:02.850]  I need like a blockage of some sort.
[23:02.990 --> 23:03.550]  Yeah, you gotta go.
[23:04.950 --> 23:07.150]  Okay, tell me where to go. I don't want to be too quick.
[23:07.470 --> 23:07.530]  Ready?
[23:09.430 --> 23:10.890]  You took too long, dude.
[23:12.690 --> 23:14.250]  Yeah, I think Eric's right.
[23:15.470 --> 23:18.210]  If nowhere's safe, staying still is even more dangerous.
[23:18.430 --> 23:20.070]  Okay, let's see where this puts you.
[23:20.070 --> 23:21.150]  Oh, I'm so hurt already.
[23:21.450 --> 23:22.190]  I'm so hurt.
[23:23.690 --> 23:24.590]  Give me this car.
[23:24.790 --> 23:26.210]  Check your map.
[23:26.410 --> 23:27.130]  Give me that.
[23:28.770 --> 23:29.470]  That's great.
[23:30.730 --> 23:31.210]  Back up.
[23:32.830 --> 23:33.490]  Backing up.
[23:33.830 --> 23:35.430]  There you go.
[23:36.290 --> 23:38.970]  Where am I going now?
[23:40.010 --> 23:41.250]  To the east.
[23:41.490 --> 23:42.610]  You gotta go east, so hold right.
[23:42.650 --> 23:43.450]  No, I'm going to the airport.
[23:43.970 --> 23:46.390]  Yeah, you're almost there.
[23:46.690 --> 23:47.650]  Yeah, this is great, dude.
[23:48.070 --> 23:50.530]  And I'm not even on fire.
[23:50.530 --> 23:54.170]  You can just land in the water and swim your way right there and you're fine.
[23:54.250 --> 23:54.910]  Look down.
[23:55.390 --> 23:56.490]  You're about to land in the water.
[23:56.690 --> 23:57.350]  Look down.
[23:58.850 --> 23:59.610]  Oh, you gotta jump out.
[24:00.690 --> 24:01.310]  Look down.
[24:02.030 --> 24:02.950]  I can't look down.
[24:03.590 --> 24:05.130]  I've gone too high for the map.
[24:05.390 --> 24:06.390]  No, just look down.
[24:07.810 --> 24:07.910]  Oh.
[24:10.730 --> 24:12.870]  This is kind of horrifying to look at.
[24:13.030 --> 24:18.430]  Do you think if you hit the water from this high, this hard, you would just turn into a human puddle?
[24:18.950 --> 24:21.110]  Yeah, you would just become part of the ocean.
[24:24.410 --> 24:26.330]  You should have gone out way sooner.
[24:27.490 --> 24:27.710]  Uh oh.
[24:27.970 --> 24:28.090]  What?
[24:30.270 --> 24:31.150]  Are we...
[24:31.150 --> 24:32.830]  Start swimming.
[24:33.430 --> 24:35.030]  Oh my god, you're gonna make it.
[24:37.210 --> 24:39.230]  You remember that episode of Magnum P.I.
[24:39.250 --> 24:40.790]  where he got stuck in the ocean
[24:40.790 --> 24:42.930]  and he had to tread water for like 18 hours
[24:42.930 --> 24:44.190]  and he almost died, but luckily
[24:44.190 --> 24:46.010]  he used his Navy training to survive.
[24:46.010 --> 24:47.510]  That's kind of what this is.
[24:47.690 --> 24:48.830]  I don't remember that.
[24:49.110 --> 24:51.150]  Yeah, this is...
[24:51.150 --> 24:52.510]  Dude, this is crazy.
[24:52.730 --> 24:54.190]  So this is a mod you installed?
[24:54.630 --> 24:57.190]  Yeah, it's like a modification of the
[24:57.800 --> 24:58.510]  handling file.
[25:00.690 --> 25:01.610]  Fucking crazy.
[25:02.150 --> 25:03.010]  What does it just turn up?
[25:03.290 --> 25:04.870]  Speed or collision or what?
[25:05.050 --> 25:05.990]  I think it just turns up speed.
[25:07.250 --> 25:09.450]  They take care of the collision all on their own.
[25:11.270 --> 25:13.850]  Is there other stuff that you can modify in that file?
[25:13.850 --> 25:15.870]  I'm not saying you can do it right now.
[25:16.070 --> 25:16.850]  Gravity, probably?
[25:17.290 --> 25:19.870]  See, that's the thing. I want to do another video
[25:19.870 --> 25:21.550]  like this where we're trying to get you somewhere
[25:21.550 --> 25:23.890]  and it's totally like, shit's wonked out.
[25:24.090 --> 25:24.970]  Like, that's so fun.
[25:25.230 --> 25:27.490]  If you guys want to see something like that, leave a comment.
[25:27.690 --> 25:29.650]  Let us know what it is we should do
[25:29.650 --> 25:31.050]  because I'm so...
[25:31.050 --> 25:32.850]  I love this.
[25:32.950 --> 25:34.090]  This video...
[25:34.090 --> 25:36.670]  I had so much fun doing this.
[25:36.970 --> 25:39.310]  This is good as shit. This rocks.
[25:40.450 --> 25:41.770]  I wonder if you turned
[25:41.770 --> 25:43.610]  gravity down if you could use boats
[25:43.610 --> 25:44.210]  to get around.
[25:46.810 --> 25:47.850]  I like how this
[25:47.850 --> 25:49.950]  went from the most chaotic, high energy
[25:49.950 --> 25:52.130]  video to the least...
[25:52.770 --> 25:53.350]  slowest
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.130]  video ever.
[25:55.550 --> 25:57.850]  This is a video of extremes.
[25:59.510 --> 26:01.470]  What's the most you think you could swim
[26:01.470 --> 26:02.350]  before you died?
[26:04.390 --> 26:05.510]  Like a mile?
[26:05.850 --> 26:07.350]  Four minutes? Five minutes?
[26:07.570 --> 26:09.590]  Yeah, like could you swim a mile
[26:10.150 --> 26:11.490]  to save your life?
[26:12.330 --> 26:13.510]  I don't think I can either.
[26:13.690 --> 26:15.310]  Oh no, Gavin!
[26:16.090 --> 26:17.430]  Gavin, you're so close!
[26:17.890 --> 26:19.170]  You can do it, Gavin. You can do it. They're floating.
[26:19.730 --> 26:21.610]  They're flying. Don't forget you can swim
[26:21.610 --> 26:23.270]  underwater, can't you? Nope.
[26:23.590 --> 26:24.870]  Oh shit, that's GTA V?
[26:25.530 --> 26:25.770]  Yep.
[26:27.090 --> 26:28.730]  You can't even fly planes in this game.
[26:29.590 --> 26:31.610]  Oh, that's right. You take like helicopters
[26:31.610 --> 26:33.310]  and stuff, right? Yeah, that's a helicopter.
[26:33.730 --> 26:34.830]  Maybe I just have to get in a helicopter.
[26:35.390 --> 26:37.010]  I can hear boats in the distance as you see.
[26:37.010 --> 26:38.630]  I'm so excited.
[26:38.890 --> 26:40.810]  Why did I say that?
[26:40.930 --> 26:43.150]  Oh no. I'm so excited for Andrew
[26:43.150 --> 26:43.930]  to see this.
[26:44.870 --> 26:47.050]  Oh boy. It said it there at the bottom,
[26:47.170 --> 26:48.290]  man. You got to the airport.
[26:48.750 --> 26:50.610]  Nah, it's gotta be on land.
[26:51.090 --> 26:52.010]  Oh no!
[26:52.670 --> 26:54.510]  Airport land. You've gotta breathe
[26:54.510 --> 26:56.890]  airport air on airport land.
[26:57.190 --> 26:58.730]  I mean, if I can get into a helicopter,
[26:58.930 --> 27:00.210]  that's a bonus, I think.
[27:00.990 --> 27:01.430]  I agree.
[27:01.430 --> 27:02.610]  Wait, are the...
[27:03.210 --> 27:07.290]  You got this, buddy.
[27:07.610 --> 27:08.870]  You got this, buddy.
[27:09.370 --> 27:09.850]  Oh, there's some
[27:10.750 --> 27:11.310]  Debris.
[27:13.210 --> 27:15.070]  I think you're past the boat
[27:15.070 --> 27:15.670]  line. Yeah.
[27:17.430 --> 27:19.290]  Holy shit, you made it.
[27:20.090 --> 27:21.250]  Oh my god.
[27:21.570 --> 27:22.110]  Wow.
[27:22.570 --> 27:24.950]  Oh no! Where did that come from?
[27:25.330 --> 27:26.550]  Gavin, you can't stop.
[27:26.610 --> 27:27.770]  You have to keep moving.
[27:28.110 --> 27:30.450]  Gavin, you have to keep going. Keep moving.
[27:30.450 --> 27:31.850]  Keep running, Gav.
[27:32.390 --> 27:33.810]  The helicopters are over here, aren't they?
[27:33.950 --> 27:36.230]  Touch the tarmac.
[27:39.190 --> 27:40.270]  Oh yeah, that counts.
[27:40.730 --> 27:41.970]  That counts. Oh shit.
[27:42.130 --> 27:43.010]  Get to that helicopter, buddy.
[27:44.670 --> 27:46.430]  Oh shit, you got the four star
[27:46.430 --> 27:48.150]  wanted level? Oh god.
[27:48.970 --> 27:50.430]  That's gonna be an issue for you.
[27:50.670 --> 27:52.250]  That's gonna be a huge problem.
[27:52.270 --> 27:53.690]  That's gonna be a real problem.
[27:54.050 --> 27:54.290]  Oh no.
[27:56.650 --> 27:58.510]  Get me there. Oh my god.
[28:00.990 --> 28:02.690]  They're all in the sky.
[28:03.910 --> 28:05.770]  All the cars are helicopters.
[28:06.330 --> 28:08.350]  You have the advantage of being on land.
[28:08.710 --> 28:09.730]  Go, go, go.
[28:12.050 --> 28:13.990]  Come on, son. Make it.
[28:14.750 --> 28:15.910]  You gotta get out of here.
[28:16.090 --> 28:17.090]  Oh god, here they come.
[28:17.510 --> 28:18.630]  They're right next to me.
[28:19.430 --> 28:21.330]  Get in. Get in now.
[28:21.730 --> 28:22.510]  Get in, you fool.
[28:25.310 --> 28:26.350]  Take off.
[28:27.670 --> 28:28.890]  I think you're good.
[28:29.310 --> 28:30.150]  Is that it?
[28:30.290 --> 28:31.030]  I think you're good.
[28:34.010 --> 28:36.370]  Oh no, they operate the same.
[28:38.670 --> 28:40.290]  No wonder I didn't see one.
[28:41.550 --> 28:42.870]  Oh, there we go.
[28:43.470 --> 28:43.750]  Guys.
[28:44.410 --> 28:45.190]  Thanks for watching.
[28:45.770 --> 28:48.410]  Gavin did it. He's the best GTA 4
[28:48.410 --> 28:49.850]  player in the world somehow.
[28:51.670 --> 28:53.270]  I can't believe that.
[28:53.510 --> 28:53.910]  That was awesome.
[28:53.910 --> 28:55.850]  Really impressive. Congratulations, Gavin.
[28:56.290 --> 28:57.150]  Thank you very much.
[28:59.410 --> 29:01.390]  And congratulations to the audience.
[29:01.510 --> 29:03.050]  You just witnessed a world first.
[29:03.670 --> 29:05.830]  No one's ever
[29:05.830 --> 29:07.570]  completed Gavin's route before
[29:07.570 --> 29:08.330]  this moment.
[29:11.610 --> 29:14.050]  See if you can get low and get sniped
[29:14.050 --> 29:14.790]  out of the air by one.
[29:16.630 --> 29:17.590]  This is crazy, guys.

[29:46.430 --> 29:47.690]  I'll just try and land.
[29:48.010 --> 29:48.330]  Yeah.
[29:49.530 --> 29:51.410]  That'll be a great way to take us out. Just land here.
[29:51.470 --> 29:53.370]  You got it. I can't stop moving.
[29:53.610 --> 29:53.910]  Oh no.
[29:57.450 --> 30:01.730]  Gavin, you just have to land.
[30:01.930 --> 30:02.910]  Gavin, just land.
[30:03.450 --> 30:04.390]  Okay, just land.
[30:05.030 --> 30:06.750]  It might have to be a little bit of a duck and dive.
[30:07.450 --> 30:09.610]  Just land right there. Look at that. Flat building.
[30:09.810 --> 30:10.370]  There you go. Landing.
[30:11.850 --> 30:12.490]  Oh no.
[30:12.490 --> 30:13.670]  Oh, Gavin.
[30:16.010 --> 30:17.310]  Well, thanks for watching.
[30:18.410 --> 30:19.230]  Uh, see you next time.
[30:19.230 --> 30:20.490]  Technically, he did land.
[30:21.070 --> 30:21.530]  Uh huh.
[30:21.730 --> 30:23.750]  Well, he's still in the air.
[30:24.170 --> 30:25.130]  We'll see you next...
[30:25.130 --> 30:25.970]  Bye.
[30:27.950 --> 30:28.330]  Bye now.
