[00:00.000 --> 00:03.400]  Hey everyone, last time you saw me get... What are you laughing at?
[00:03.980 --> 00:06.400]  I thought that was good, Gavin. I'm on your side.
[00:06.740 --> 00:12.540]  I got three words in it. You caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting it. I'm sorry. Please go ahead.
[00:12.800 --> 00:19.100]  I would hate to make it harder on anybody else to start a fucking video, so please.
[00:21.500 --> 00:27.600]  All right. Last time you saw me get bullied by cars as I tried to make my way to the airport.
[00:27.600 --> 00:32.900]  However, I was cheating, really, in that I would warp to closer hospitals if I got near them.
[00:33.340 --> 00:38.040]  So now, Nick's playing, and he's invincible. I am.
[00:38.100 --> 00:44.240]  From some lovely suggestions by the audience. Go back in. Go back in. Go back in.
[00:44.260 --> 00:50.020]  All right. All right. Let's take a second. Hang on. Where are you going this time, then?
[00:50.020 --> 00:52.280]  Yeah, where are you? Let's see where you are on the... All right.
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.540]  Oh, give him a location, Gavin. But here's the problem.
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.180]  He is on the first mission of the game. He can't go anywhere.
[01:03.180 --> 01:07.520]  Oh, when he... He can get knocked by a car across the ocean pretty easily.
[01:08.100 --> 01:12.820]  He can go there. He'll just have a five-star wanted level, I think, when he crosses the bridge.
[01:13.320 --> 01:16.660]  So, Nick... I'm invincible, so it's fine. Nick, why don't you go ahead and get to the
[01:16.660 --> 01:20.080]  very far left of the map? That's what I was going to say, but what's over there?
[01:20.080 --> 01:22.580]  Put a waypoint. What's at the top? What's at the top left?
[01:22.740 --> 01:25.160]  Oh, you want to... Oh, how about this? It looks like a warehouse or something.
[01:25.300 --> 01:26.480]  Yeah, there you go. Looks like a factory.
[01:26.480 --> 01:28.260]  There you go. That's your new house.
[01:28.460 --> 01:31.740]  It looks like a jug on its side, and it's pouring out all the roads.
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.240]  Yeah. All right, we're down here.
[01:33.400 --> 01:37.640]  So we have to cross multiple bridges, loads of space.
[01:38.280 --> 01:41.100]  It's the south of all the roads. Nothing but sauce.
[01:41.700 --> 01:44.000]  I believe in you, Nick, so why don't you go ahead and do it?
[01:44.060 --> 01:47.140]  Again, you're invincible and traffic's at the highest speed.
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.140]  Is that what you're saying? Wow, that actually helped.
[01:52.360 --> 01:54.900]  That was really useful. You're set now, dude.
[01:55.480 --> 01:57.920]  Oh, wow. This is going to... Oh, my God.
[01:57.940 --> 02:02.120]  Oh, they're flying. All right, so we've got to ban railroads, right?
[02:02.660 --> 02:04.260]  Okay, so I'll jump down. You can't be up here.
[02:04.420 --> 02:06.740]  You've got to get down to the street. You've got to be with the people, Nick.
[02:06.780 --> 02:08.180]  You've got to be down with the muck.
[02:10.940 --> 02:13.680]  Well, don't get in the street. That's where the cars are.
[02:14.920 --> 02:18.520]  Railroads are baby stuff. Jesus Christ.
[02:18.880 --> 02:21.000]  I think I'm going to cross that bridge, Nick.
[02:21.840 --> 02:23.780]  He's going to make it faster than I did, I think.
[02:24.500 --> 02:27.700]  He's just getting launched. He's also going to use the phone.
[02:28.340 --> 02:30.540]  What are you doing, man? I was looking at the map.
[02:34.540 --> 02:35.960]  Where's Superman? Where's my cape?
[02:40.940 --> 02:51.660]  He's trying to make a game plan of like, okay, I'm going to go back here.
[02:51.800 --> 02:53.160]  I'm going to find my way across the bridge.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.000]  Oh, my God.
[02:54.120 --> 02:58.080]  Oh, yeah. Good job, buddy.
[02:58.460 --> 03:01.040]  Yeah, that really does a lot with that.
[03:01.140 --> 03:01.760]  I didn't get hit.
[03:01.960 --> 03:05.160]  You never know when there's an invisible, gentle ghost right around the corner.
[03:06.940 --> 03:11.640]  I think my favorite thing about the cabs is that the top of the little ads on the top come off.
[03:11.800 --> 03:13.360]  It's like an additional, oh, shit.
[03:13.760 --> 03:14.240]  You can get in that.
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.720]  Oh, yeah. Oh, you're going to be here in no time.
[03:16.780 --> 03:17.920]  All right, gas it.
[03:19.160 --> 03:19.580]  Hold on.
[03:20.880 --> 03:21.480]  Oh, it's on fire.
[03:21.640 --> 03:21.860]  I got it.
[03:22.760 --> 03:24.360]  He's invincible. He didn't care.
[03:24.400 --> 03:24.880]  Oh, yeah, I am.
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.180]  Oh, my God.
[03:39.820 --> 03:42.060]  He's rolling around in flames.
[03:42.820 --> 03:44.040]  Are you okay, buddy?
[03:44.280 --> 03:46.860]  It sounds like the horn's coming from that guy.
[03:48.120 --> 03:50.380]  Yeah, it's a squale of doom.
[03:50.380 --> 03:52.300]  He got hit so hard his horn went off.
[03:56.640 --> 03:57.940]  Oh, look at that draw distance.
[03:58.720 --> 03:59.300]  Look at this.
[03:59.520 --> 03:59.680]  Beautiful.
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.180]  Look at that car density.
[04:03.320 --> 04:03.840]  All right.
[04:04.400 --> 04:05.280]  Oh, this is great.
[04:05.460 --> 04:06.540]  No one's even going to get you, dude.
[04:07.160 --> 04:07.940]  Dude, you're set.
[04:08.860 --> 04:09.580]  Sitting pretty.
[04:09.980 --> 04:10.220]  Yep.
[04:10.440 --> 04:11.000]  Oh, yeah.
[04:11.080 --> 04:12.540]  You're going to encounter some fire, though.
[04:13.040 --> 04:13.800]  Yeah, that's fine.
[04:14.360 --> 04:14.600]  Yeah.
[04:15.060 --> 04:16.580]  You might have to find another way across.
[04:16.700 --> 04:17.300]  I'm not sure if you'll...
[04:19.560 --> 04:19.960]  Hey, bud.
[04:20.380 --> 04:20.820]  How's it going?
[04:21.140 --> 04:21.560]  We'll let him.
[04:22.080 --> 04:22.900]  I think you can just go.
[04:23.800 --> 04:25.740]  Oh, we got a troublemaker.
[04:33.020 --> 04:33.900]  Oh, no.
[04:35.100 --> 04:36.040]  Oh, no.
[04:36.860 --> 04:38.340]  Oh, my God.
[04:39.100 --> 04:39.540]  Holy...
[04:39.540 --> 04:40.960]  Where are you?
[04:41.100 --> 04:41.960]  Gavin, he made it.
[04:42.080 --> 04:42.960]  Gavin, he made it.
[04:44.360 --> 04:45.500]  Go, Nick, go.
[04:45.960 --> 04:46.980]  Nick, go.
[04:47.540 --> 04:48.500]  Let me go.
[04:48.620 --> 04:49.200]  Nick, come on.
[04:49.200 --> 04:51.440]  Oh, what a sneak.
[04:52.160 --> 04:53.420]  All right, we got to go north.
[04:53.660 --> 04:54.640]  Yeah, you got to go north.
[04:55.140 --> 04:55.900]  You got this, Nick.
[04:59.160 --> 05:01.120]  Are you on the third island or the second?
[05:01.440 --> 05:01.720]  Second.
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.160]  I think he's on the second island.
[05:04.120 --> 05:05.620]  Six star haunted level.
[05:06.000 --> 05:06.840]  Or the bridge, I think.
[05:07.800 --> 05:09.620]  They're going to call in the men in black on you.
[05:09.980 --> 05:10.880]  They're never going to get you.
[05:11.020 --> 05:12.480]  Also, there's no cars over here, dude.
[05:12.480 --> 05:12.940]  You're good.
[05:13.760 --> 05:17.180]  Did I just not spawn in cars because you're not allowed over here yet?
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.280]  No, there's a car right there.
[05:19.200 --> 05:19.780]  Oh, that's...
[05:24.100 --> 05:25.000]  Spawned a car.
[05:25.640 --> 05:26.780]  Oh, look, a motorcycle.
[05:26.980 --> 05:28.000]  Motorcycle, motorcycle.
[05:28.460 --> 05:28.780]  Get it.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.320]  Let's try this.
[05:30.340 --> 05:30.620]  Okay, you got it.
[05:31.280 --> 05:32.540]  Okay, just back it up.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.140]  Oh my god.
[05:34.700 --> 05:35.340]  Oh my god.
[05:35.440 --> 05:36.060]  Okay, you got it.
[05:36.060 --> 05:36.220]  Holy shit.
[05:36.240 --> 05:36.620]  Hang on right...
[05:36.620 --> 05:37.500]  You got to go north.
[05:38.160 --> 05:38.940]  You got to go north.
[05:39.580 --> 05:40.700]  Oh, you're flying.
[05:42.860 --> 05:44.680]  Oh, you're a ghost rider.
[05:44.920 --> 05:45.520]  This is the wrong way.
[05:46.060 --> 05:46.840]  No, you're...
[05:46.840 --> 05:47.120]  No!
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.440]  Oh my god.
[05:49.440 --> 05:51.320]  I think you sent us back, Nick.
[05:52.640 --> 05:53.860]  All the way south.
[05:59.880 --> 06:00.960]  Swim to the poop deck.
[06:03.060 --> 06:04.500]  I'm gonna scrub it so good.
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.900]  The bike rode on the side of the road.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.240]  Oh, what an angle.
[06:12.300 --> 06:13.400]  Oh my god.
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.540]  All right, you got to get out of here, Nick.
[06:14.580 --> 06:15.620]  You got it. You got to go north.
[06:15.740 --> 06:16.420]  I'm gonna take this.
[06:16.420 --> 06:17.680]  You're gonna have to take a car.
[06:17.800 --> 06:18.600]  Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that.
[06:18.780 --> 06:18.940]  What?
[06:19.280 --> 06:19.840]  Never mind.
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.540]  That one's already lit up.
[06:21.680 --> 06:23.800]  That one was smashed to hell and full of cops.
[06:24.220 --> 06:24.560]  Yeah.
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.300]  Oh my god.
[06:29.000 --> 06:29.220]  Hello.
[06:30.280 --> 06:31.700]  Come on, Nick. You got to get out of here.
[06:31.880 --> 06:33.780]  Oh, they shot the guy in the... oh no!
[06:34.140 --> 06:34.720]  Oh no!
[06:35.020 --> 06:35.380]  Dude.
[06:35.940 --> 06:36.200]  Hot dog man!
[06:36.200 --> 06:37.540]  They shot the hot dog man!
[06:39.960 --> 06:40.540]  The hot dog man!
[06:40.540 --> 06:42.220]  Nick, I think there's a car over there to your right.
[06:42.400 --> 06:42.540]  Yep.
[06:43.380 --> 06:44.260]  There's one to the left, too.
[06:44.300 --> 06:44.700]  Oh, cool.
[06:44.700 --> 06:49.220]  I would watch four three-hour movies of just that.
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.120]  This is luck horizon.
[06:51.680 --> 06:53.260]  Just do this, Kevin Costner.
[06:53.580 --> 06:55.960]  This is the movie Michael Bay should direct.
[06:55.960 --> 06:56.180]  All right.
[06:56.320 --> 06:56.760]  Yes.
[06:56.880 --> 06:57.300]  Easy.
[06:58.200 --> 06:58.640]  Easy.
[06:59.020 --> 06:59.460]  Easy.
[06:59.780 --> 07:00.280]  Nice and easy.
[07:00.380 --> 07:01.340]  Go, you got to go, you got to go!
[07:01.460 --> 07:01.800]  Go!
[07:02.120 --> 07:03.240]  Are you shitting me?
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.380]  Are you shitting me?
[07:04.380 --> 07:06.240]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.840]  Hey, hey, you know what?
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.520]  I haven't played this game in a long time.
[07:11.140 --> 07:12.300]  What is it gonna put you...
[07:12.300 --> 07:13.380]  It's gonna beat you back...
[07:13.380 --> 07:14.740]  You're back at the beginning!
[07:15.260 --> 07:15.680]  That's great.
[07:16.080 --> 07:17.200]  That's awesome, Nick.
[07:17.520 --> 07:20.420]  Oh, wait, you're gonna cross?
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.660]  You almost crossed the whole river.
[07:25.860 --> 07:30.840]  That's how I impacted that, uh, when I fell in the airport, in the, uh, in the plane yesterday.
[07:33.540 --> 07:33.980]  Okay.
[07:34.220 --> 07:36.160]  Nick, why did you let yourself get arrested?
[07:37.280 --> 07:40.020]  Dude, you look cool as hell emerging from the flames like a phoenix.
[07:40.460 --> 07:41.420]  Oh no, that guy!
[07:41.420 --> 07:42.560]  That guy didn't...
[07:43.080 --> 07:43.700]  Oh, wow.
[07:43.800 --> 07:44.260]  He didn't make it.
[07:46.780 --> 07:47.660]  That's everyone's fault!
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.280]  That's everyone's...
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.680]  Oh, that guy got hit through the tunnel!
[07:52.680 --> 07:53.240]  Oh, no, look out!
[07:53.840 --> 07:54.940]  Hey, Roman texted you.
[07:54.940 --> 07:56.100]  Yeah, Roman wants to see what's up.
[07:56.860 --> 07:57.460]  What do you want, Roman?
[07:58.480 --> 07:59.640]  Hey, man, I need help, too!
[08:00.900 --> 08:01.400]  All right.
[08:02.300 --> 08:03.420]  He said, shit, need help, man.
[08:04.600 --> 08:05.000]  Isn't that a...
[08:05.000 --> 08:05.320]  BOOM!
[08:07.280 --> 08:07.960]  Holy shit!
[08:08.180 --> 08:09.180]  Oh, in the gate!
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.400]  Did a couple of well-timed yeets.
[08:12.580 --> 08:16.540]  Yeah, I think if you stand in the middle here, don't start the mission.
[08:16.540 --> 08:18.680]  I think if you stand in the middle of the road there,
[08:18.680 --> 08:20.460]  I think you'll get knocked across the street.
[08:20.640 --> 08:22.780]  Yeah, think of yourself as a cannonball.
[08:23.260 --> 08:24.060]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[08:24.320 --> 08:24.760]  I'll go stand.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.640]  I'll go stand right here.
[08:25.880 --> 08:26.060]  Okay.
[08:26.340 --> 08:26.580]  Okay.
[08:26.620 --> 08:27.020]  Like right there.
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.200]  I think this will do it.
[08:30.460 --> 08:31.500]  Get on the train!
[08:35.940 --> 08:36.660]  Wrong way.
[08:37.680 --> 08:38.040]  Okay.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.680]  Could you open your map for a minute?
[08:39.680 --> 08:40.300]  Niko, get up!
[08:40.560 --> 08:41.620]  See where you're at?
[08:41.780 --> 08:42.600]  Niko, you're in boat...
[08:42.600 --> 08:42.960]  Niko!
[08:43.440 --> 08:45.960]  He's on, I think, to the south of the first one.
[08:46.060 --> 08:46.520]  Oh, man.
[08:46.520 --> 08:47.360]  He's right next to it.
[08:47.400 --> 08:47.780]  You're not even.
[08:47.940 --> 08:47.960]  Okay.
[08:48.220 --> 08:48.580]  Let's see.
[08:48.780 --> 08:50.700]  They seem to spawn when I'm not looking, so...
[08:50.700 --> 08:50.820]  Yeah.
[08:53.660 --> 08:54.020]  Oh!
[08:57.980 --> 08:58.620]  That's like halfway.
[08:58.620 --> 08:59.460]  That wasn't a bad hit.
[08:59.900 --> 09:00.460]  It's not bad.
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.700]  I think you just gotta make it now.
[09:01.900 --> 09:02.640]  Oh, now you gotta...
[09:02.640 --> 09:04.200]  This is like water frogger.
[09:04.380 --> 09:05.700]  You just gotta avoid the boats.
[09:05.700 --> 09:06.040]  Oh.
[09:07.720 --> 09:10.820]  Luckily, most of the boats fly about 15 feet above the water.
[09:10.860 --> 09:12.560]  Yeah, they get going. You'll be all right.
[09:13.180 --> 09:14.500]  This is like...
[09:14.500 --> 09:17.480]  They made a new Quiet Place movie, and I just want it to be this.
[09:17.580 --> 09:18.020]  Yeah.
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.000]  A very loud place.
[09:25.340 --> 09:26.440]  The loudest place.
[09:27.400 --> 09:27.680]  Oh!
[09:27.680 --> 09:28.280]  Oh, buses!
[09:28.660 --> 09:29.140]  Niko, car!
[09:29.280 --> 09:29.940]  Niko, car!
[09:30.080 --> 09:31.460]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[09:31.520 --> 09:31.820]  No cops.
[09:31.820 --> 09:33.320]  Just make sure no cops get you.
[09:33.480 --> 09:34.760]  There is one right next to me.
[09:34.760 --> 09:37.080]  You better just get in that car while you're walking.
[09:37.220 --> 09:38.640]  Get in the car, you gotta go.
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.740]  No, go to this one.
[09:39.760 --> 09:40.200]  Go to this one.
[09:40.380 --> 09:41.060]  It's a better color.
[09:41.240 --> 09:41.980]  It's a better color.
[09:42.100 --> 09:42.760]  It's a nicer car.
[09:42.840 --> 09:43.300]  It's a better color.
[09:43.420 --> 09:43.760]  It's bigger.
[09:43.980 --> 09:44.560]  It's a stronger car.
[09:45.160 --> 09:45.500]  Stronger car.
[09:45.540 --> 09:46.300]  A fire truck behind you.
[09:46.320 --> 09:46.760]  A fire truck.
[09:46.800 --> 09:47.580]  I'm gonna go to the fire truck.
[09:47.660 --> 09:48.280]  I'm gonna back up to it.
[09:48.860 --> 09:50.540]  You gotta back up and spin around.
[09:50.660 --> 09:51.240]  I think you gotta go.
[09:51.340 --> 09:51.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:52.620 --> 09:53.260]  Yeah, there you go.
[09:55.060 --> 09:55.340]  Okay.
[09:55.720 --> 09:56.700]  Just a little bit.
[09:56.820 --> 09:57.340]  There you go.
[09:57.680 --> 09:57.900]  Okay.
[10:01.100 --> 10:03.040]  So that was a little bit more than a little bit.
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.200]  You know what?
[10:04.260 --> 10:04.800]  You're going north.
[10:05.080 --> 10:05.900]  Oh, you better jump out.
[10:05.980 --> 10:06.240]  Jump out.
[10:06.360 --> 10:06.740]  Jump out.
[10:07.020 --> 10:07.360]  Jump out.
[10:07.460 --> 10:07.760]  Oh, no, no, no.
[10:07.800 --> 10:08.180]  Not the water.
[10:08.240 --> 10:08.580]  Not the water.
[10:08.680 --> 10:08.960]  Not the water.
[10:09.000 --> 10:09.480]  Oh, Niko.
[10:09.960 --> 10:10.280]  Niko.
[10:11.100 --> 10:12.520]  Oh, the Statue of Liberty.
[10:12.800 --> 10:15.360]  This head is really not where you want to be.
[10:15.800 --> 10:16.580]  That's what I'm saying.
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.360]  You went too far too fast, man.
[10:20.580 --> 10:21.940]  You know what would be funny?
[10:22.200 --> 10:23.160]  Ooh, the other island.
[10:23.320 --> 10:24.180]  Turn this on.
[10:24.980 --> 10:25.560]  I don't know.
[10:25.580 --> 10:26.780]  Maybe modify it slightly.
[10:26.940 --> 10:29.240]  But then have Gavin try to take his driving test.
[10:29.260 --> 10:30.240]  But in Liberty City.
[10:30.980 --> 10:32.700]  Like Gavin trying to parallel park.
[10:32.700 --> 10:33.860]  In this scenario.
[10:39.020 --> 10:40.780]  Oh, you're in such a big spot.
[10:41.780 --> 10:42.380]  Oh, yeah, we're good.
[10:42.460 --> 10:42.820]  Look at that.
[10:42.880 --> 10:43.980]  Just a whole island to go.
[10:44.500 --> 10:44.620]  Yeah.
[10:45.060 --> 10:46.260]  Look how far you've already come.
[10:46.680 --> 10:47.840]  Oh, here we go.
[10:47.940 --> 10:48.300]  Here we go.
[10:48.420 --> 10:49.280]  We'll take this bad boy.
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.400]  Yeah, there you go.
[10:52.120 --> 10:52.640]  All right, Niko.
[10:52.780 --> 10:53.760]  We got to floor it a little.
[10:53.980 --> 10:55.720]  All right, you got to just give it a little bit.
[10:55.800 --> 10:56.720]  You got to go north.
[10:57.080 --> 10:59.360]  You guys got a personalized license plate that says Liberty City.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.300]  And there you go.
[11:01.660 --> 11:02.420]  Yeah, all right.
[11:02.420 --> 11:04.020]  Okay, all right.
[11:04.020 --> 11:04.540]  Okay, all right.
[11:04.600 --> 11:05.700]  Okay, here we go.
[11:05.700 --> 11:07.760]  You're pretty good at like regaining control of it.
[11:08.060 --> 11:09.040]  Oh, no.
[11:09.140 --> 11:09.980]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[11:10.180 --> 11:10.420]  Okay.
[11:11.220 --> 11:11.940]  All right.
[11:12.000 --> 11:12.600]  I need a new car.
[11:12.740 --> 11:14.780]  All right, well.
[11:15.780 --> 11:17.220]  I think you got to get to a main road.
[11:18.020 --> 11:19.900]  You're like, you're in the middle of stuff.
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.300]  And I think you got to get to a main road.
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.240]  Oh, God.
[11:23.920 --> 11:25.340]  It was a cab top.
[11:25.460 --> 11:26.320]  It killed that guy.
[11:26.540 --> 11:29.920]  You got killed by a cab top.
[11:30.220 --> 11:31.480]  I think if you go this way,
[11:31.480 --> 11:33.560]  you are close to crossing the wrong bridge.
[11:34.180 --> 11:34.580]  Maybe.
[11:36.040 --> 11:38.340]  But I mean, no, no, it turns north, Eric.
[11:38.580 --> 11:38.860]  Okay.
[11:42.680 --> 11:43.760]  You turn north.
[11:44.480 --> 11:45.540]  Yeah, you're going east.
[11:45.660 --> 11:47.000]  If he goes far enough south.
[11:47.720 --> 11:48.880]  Okay, all right.
[11:48.920 --> 11:49.420]  Round two.
[11:49.500 --> 11:49.920]  Here we go.
[11:50.640 --> 11:51.760]  We can go either way.
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.520]  Do you want to go east and then north?
[11:54.600 --> 11:55.340]  I want to go north.
[11:55.420 --> 11:55.820]  Or west and north.
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.880]  You're acting like you can actually chart this in a way that is calculated.
[12:01.800 --> 12:03.460]  He's on the third island, not us.
[12:03.560 --> 12:04.340]  He's making progress.
[12:04.720 --> 12:06.300]  I'm just saying, like, he's going to get there.
[12:06.420 --> 12:08.140]  It's not going to be the way he plans.
[12:08.920 --> 12:09.820]  Well, of course not.
[12:10.060 --> 12:11.620]  But see, look, cars are this way.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.520]  So we should go this way.
[12:12.540 --> 12:13.740]  Oh, my God.
[12:14.060 --> 12:15.560]  Cars are this way.
[12:16.560 --> 12:18.340]  I'm trying to run towards the traffic.
[12:18.600 --> 12:20.640]  Oh, yeah, that one went to space.
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.100]  Oh, oh, oh, Nick, one time.
[12:27.320 --> 12:28.380]  Are you all right?
[12:28.480 --> 12:29.100]  Oh, wow, he made it.
[12:29.100 --> 12:30.060]  He seems totally fine.
[12:30.060 --> 12:33.080]  Oh, you got so lucky.
[12:33.080 --> 12:34.500]  You don't know how he survived that.
[12:35.020 --> 12:36.100]  Oh, my God.
[12:36.180 --> 12:38.340]  I think it peed off of his bottle.
[12:39.780 --> 12:40.940]  Okay, all right.
[12:41.280 --> 12:42.600]  We're going to play dodge the cars.
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.020]  Yeah, this is the safest place to be is in the median.
[12:45.720 --> 12:46.360]  Is that a boat?
[12:47.280 --> 12:48.260]  Is that a boat?
[12:48.280 --> 12:48.580]  Up there?
[12:48.920 --> 12:49.160]  Yeah.
[12:49.700 --> 12:51.000]  Yeah, yeah, it is.
[12:55.540 --> 12:56.760]  Oh, not for the drop.
[12:57.340 --> 13:00.560]  Oh, hug the wall.
[13:00.900 --> 13:01.520]  Okay, oh, median.
[13:02.280 --> 13:03.740]  This is like Mission Impossible.
[13:04.680 --> 13:05.580]  Extra median.
[13:14.530 --> 13:15.490]  Oh, shit.
[13:15.890 --> 13:16.730]  Oh, we got your car.
[13:16.950 --> 13:18.490]  What are you doing?
[13:20.810 --> 13:21.970]  Oh, get up.
[13:22.050 --> 13:22.490]  Get up.
[13:22.810 --> 13:23.110]  First Island.
[13:23.470 --> 13:24.350]  You're gonna have to start over.
[13:24.450 --> 13:25.270]  They're gonna arrest you.
[13:25.490 --> 13:26.550]  They're gonna arrest you.
[13:26.770 --> 13:28.510]  Oh, you made it.
[13:28.630 --> 13:29.390]  You made it.
[13:29.650 --> 13:31.250]  Oh, no, it's going back.
[13:32.910 --> 13:35.630]  Did you briefly get like a stunt cam for that?
[13:35.630 --> 13:37.070]  He got a stunt cam for that.
[13:37.690 --> 13:39.470]  Oh, look, look, guys, look.
[13:39.950 --> 13:41.490]  Hey, Cap, get in the back as a passenger.
[13:42.110 --> 13:43.730]  Oh, never mind.
[13:44.270 --> 13:44.870]  No, no, no.
[13:44.870 --> 13:45.430]  Oh, well.
[13:46.090 --> 13:46.830]  Oh, no.
[13:47.770 --> 13:48.630]  All right, Nick.
[13:49.390 --> 13:50.250]  It's go time, baby.
[13:50.370 --> 13:51.010]  Oh, my gosh.
[13:51.350 --> 13:52.070]  Oh, no.
[13:52.370 --> 13:52.830]  Get the fuck out of here.
[13:53.590 --> 13:54.910]  All right, you little son of a bitch.
[13:55.310 --> 13:57.050]  Just having a scuffle in the middle of this.
[13:57.470 --> 14:00.610]  Get out of the way, prick.
[14:01.850 --> 14:03.630]  Jesus, he's tough as nails, man.
[14:03.730 --> 14:05.210]  Yeah, that's what his hands are vulnerable to.
[14:05.830 --> 14:06.830]  He is a cabbie.
[14:07.390 --> 14:07.770]  Oh, shit.
[14:08.290 --> 14:09.210]  All right, which way, buddy?
[14:09.510 --> 14:10.530]  Barely dodged it.
[14:10.930 --> 14:11.690]  All right, where to, Nick?
[14:12.330 --> 14:13.990]  Well, it seems we're going this way.
[14:15.150 --> 14:17.810]  No, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[14:19.210 --> 14:20.070]  Pop your shoes.
[14:20.730 --> 14:20.790]  No.
[14:25.390 --> 14:25.790]  Oh.
[14:29.280 --> 14:29.680]  Oh.
[14:31.320 --> 14:34.500]  It's like when he was on the bridge and charting a course.
[14:36.060 --> 14:38.680]  Hey, do you remember when we were afraid this would be too easy?
[14:41.480 --> 14:41.840]  No.
[14:43.780 --> 14:45.200]  There's some cars right there, dude.
[14:45.500 --> 14:47.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:47.180 --> 14:50.660]  So I guess they like despawn a lot of the regular traffic when you've got six stars.
[14:51.020 --> 14:51.780]  I guess so.
[14:51.960 --> 14:52.800]  That would make sense.
[14:54.760 --> 14:56.400]  All right, let's just give it a little...
[14:57.160 --> 14:57.840]  Yeah, just a little.
[14:57.840 --> 14:59.720]  You got to like back up and spin around, I think.
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.300]  There you go.
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.100]  Nice and easy.
[15:01.800 --> 15:02.520]  There you go.
[15:02.760 --> 15:03.660]  Got it.
[15:04.940 --> 15:05.620]  There's traffic.
[15:06.820 --> 15:07.660]  There's the traffic.
[15:08.320 --> 15:09.080]  It's a little...
[15:10.200 --> 15:11.180]  This actually works.
[15:11.180 --> 15:12.040]  This works, this works.
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.200]  This is good.
[15:13.940 --> 15:15.720]  You should jump out, you should jump out, you should jump out.
[15:15.740 --> 15:16.820]  Not yet, not yet.
[15:16.880 --> 15:17.380]  Bouncy time.
[15:17.800 --> 15:18.420]  Oh, oh, no.
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.360]  Okay, I'm jumping down now.
[15:19.480 --> 15:19.980]  You're going to ping.
[15:20.260 --> 15:22.080]  I just don't like...
[15:22.080 --> 15:25.040]  You think it's going to be in your benefit and it's...
[15:25.040 --> 15:25.480]  It is.
[15:25.580 --> 15:26.420]  Look at where we're going.
[15:26.560 --> 15:26.860]  Yeah.
[15:26.860 --> 15:29.860]  I think you would have stayed in, honestly, if you shot back across.
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  You may have been better off.
[15:32.480 --> 15:33.500]  I like the bounces.
[15:33.740 --> 15:33.880]  All right, here.
[15:34.020 --> 15:34.880]  I'm a fan of strategy.
[15:35.420 --> 15:36.640]  Yeah, it's a good strategy.
[15:37.440 --> 15:38.300]  You got this.
[15:39.180 --> 15:39.580]  Parkour.
[15:44.260 --> 15:45.260]  Oh, he's going to get arrested.
[15:47.480 --> 15:49.800]  That was like a titanic propella guy.
[15:50.000 --> 15:50.280]  Yeah.
[15:50.860 --> 15:52.060]  Oh, yeah, it really was.
[15:52.700 --> 15:53.520]  All right, Nick, where to?
[15:53.600 --> 15:55.940]  That just turned your legs into accordions.
[15:55.940 --> 15:56.520]  Oh.
[16:01.900 --> 16:06.600]  You think the head of Geico is, like, looking out their window just sweating profusely?
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.460]  We're ruined, we're ruined.
[16:09.860 --> 16:10.340]  We're done.
[16:10.980 --> 16:11.960]  He jumps out the window.
[16:13.580 --> 16:14.160]  Come on, man.
[16:14.580 --> 16:15.060]  Help me out.
[16:17.160 --> 16:17.980]  What's the plan?
[16:18.920 --> 16:19.320]  Get hit.
[16:19.520 --> 16:20.180]  Gotta go north.
[16:20.800 --> 16:21.440]  Go fly.
[16:21.760 --> 16:22.520]  Yeah, he's just teeing up.
[16:22.780 --> 16:24.920]  Yeah, you just stay in the lane right here.
[16:24.920 --> 16:26.880]  Somebody will show up.
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.540]  Yeah, someone's going to go northbound at some point.
[16:32.340 --> 16:32.700]  Yeah.
[16:32.920 --> 16:33.960]  I don't even know what...
[16:33.960 --> 16:36.080]  Are you on the right island or you're in the second island?
[16:36.100 --> 16:37.260]  He's in the middle island.
[16:37.300 --> 16:37.700]  Second island.
[16:37.920 --> 16:38.220]  Here we go.
[16:38.340 --> 16:38.860]  Ah, there you go.
[16:38.880 --> 16:39.240]  Here we go.
[16:39.320 --> 16:39.660]  There you go.
[16:39.720 --> 16:39.900]  There you go.
[16:41.940 --> 16:42.420]  That's okay.
[16:42.760 --> 16:43.260]  Look at that blood streak.
[16:43.900 --> 16:45.300]  You took your blood, not you.
[16:46.040 --> 16:46.900]  Look at that.
[16:47.300 --> 16:48.500]  Oh, it is long.
[16:49.220 --> 16:49.780]  Here we go.
[16:50.260 --> 16:51.120]  Are you using your control?
[16:51.380 --> 16:52.180]  There you go.
[16:52.740 --> 16:53.180]  That helps.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.700]  Ah, stupid wall.
[16:54.700 --> 16:55.600]  Are you on controller, Nick?
[16:56.460 --> 16:56.780]  Yeah.
[16:56.900 --> 17:00.520]  I think if you click right stick, the camera might flip for you.
[17:00.600 --> 17:01.200]  Oh, flip around?
[17:01.260 --> 17:01.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[17:01.900 --> 17:02.060]  Okay, sweet.
[17:02.880 --> 17:03.480]  Oh, cars.
[17:03.560 --> 17:04.420]  Cars, cars, cars, cars, cars.
[17:04.420 --> 17:04.880]  Oh, perfect.
[17:05.060 --> 17:05.340]  Lovely.
[17:07.120 --> 17:08.240]  Nice little ramp, too.
[17:08.560 --> 17:09.100]  Oh, look at that.
[17:09.140 --> 17:09.480]  Oh, yeah.
[17:09.800 --> 17:11.440]  All right, let's see where we are.
[17:12.200 --> 17:12.960]  Oh, we don't want to go...
[17:12.960 --> 17:14.000]  We want to go west, actually.
[17:14.220 --> 17:14.380]  Yeah.
[17:15.200 --> 17:16.680]  And you're right in the position.
[17:16.680 --> 17:17.240]  Yeah, you're right here.
[17:17.320 --> 17:20.040]  I think you just got to back up and then take the bridge, right?
[17:20.420 --> 17:20.720]  Yeah.
[17:21.920 --> 17:22.560]  Easy peasy.
[17:22.740 --> 17:23.520]  Yeah, that looks easy.
[17:24.700 --> 17:25.000]  All right.
[17:26.000 --> 17:26.700]  There you go.
[17:27.020 --> 17:27.560]  There you go.
[17:27.580 --> 17:28.200]  All right, to the bridge.
[17:28.360 --> 17:28.740]  Oh, easy.
[17:29.020 --> 17:30.140]  Oh, you had it, too.
[17:30.220 --> 17:30.520]  Uh-oh.
[17:30.580 --> 17:31.600]  Get out, get out, get out.
[17:31.620 --> 17:32.560]  I don't even know which way you're going.
[17:33.140 --> 17:34.040]  Oh, no, you're going back.
[17:34.040 --> 17:34.500]  You are going back.
[17:34.500 --> 17:35.520]  Oh, no, I'm going east.
[17:36.040 --> 17:36.360]  No!
[17:38.200 --> 17:39.060]  Oh, no, the highway.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.420]  Oh, no, the highway.
[17:40.680 --> 17:42.180]  Do your best to hit the bridge, dude.
[17:42.360 --> 17:42.820]  Oh, no.
[17:42.840 --> 17:44.180]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[17:44.680 --> 17:45.700]  Don't keep sending the gritty in the air.
[17:47.360 --> 17:47.680]  God.
[17:48.420 --> 17:49.180]  Hey, there's a boat.
[17:50.380 --> 17:51.060]  Oh, there you go.
[17:51.140 --> 17:51.400]  Try it.
[17:52.100 --> 17:53.120]  Yeah, let's just get in it.
[17:53.140 --> 17:53.900]  Yeah, dude, definitely try it.
[17:53.920 --> 17:54.380]  Oh, shit.
[17:54.380 --> 17:54.740]  Oh!
[17:56.760 --> 17:57.060]  It's...
[17:57.060 --> 17:58.560]  It looks like Carl Linslow.
[17:59.440 --> 17:59.840]  Get him.
[17:59.900 --> 18:00.520]  He's getting arrested.
[18:00.740 --> 18:01.300]  You're starting over.
[18:02.180 --> 18:02.760]  You're starting over.
[18:03.260 --> 18:03.980]  Not like this.
[18:04.300 --> 18:05.100]  Just get in the boat.
[18:05.560 --> 18:06.100]  No, hold on.
[18:06.160 --> 18:07.700]  If I get in, the other guy is going to kill me.
[18:07.760 --> 18:08.380]  So I got to take...
[18:08.380 --> 18:09.040]  You got to kill this guy.
[18:09.120 --> 18:10.240]  No, you just got to hit the other guy.
[18:10.340 --> 18:11.680]  You just got to hit go.
[18:12.860 --> 18:14.020]  Yeah, shove him to death.
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.140]  Niko, hit him.
[18:19.700 --> 18:20.340]  You're not...
[18:20.980 --> 18:21.800]  There we go.
[18:21.860 --> 18:22.480]  You got a gun now?
[18:22.560 --> 18:22.840]  How do I...
[18:22.840 --> 18:23.900]  How do I pull out a gun?
[18:23.900 --> 18:24.480]  There you go.
[18:29.170 --> 18:30.390]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[18:30.630 --> 18:31.010]  Oh, wait.
[18:31.190 --> 18:32.430]  Yeah, you just eliminate him.
[18:32.750 --> 18:33.510]  Yeah, I got that guy.
[18:33.650 --> 18:34.330]  Now you're set.
[18:34.590 --> 18:35.170]  Get up in that boat.
[18:35.170 --> 18:36.090]  You are set.
[18:36.610 --> 18:37.430]  Let's do this.
[18:37.510 --> 18:37.990]  You guys ready?
[18:38.490 --> 18:40.330]  I don't think it's gonna go.
[18:41.050 --> 18:41.410]  Go.
[18:42.690 --> 18:43.410]  Might need a bit...
[18:43.410 --> 18:43.870]  Yeah!
[18:44.910 --> 18:47.550]  Okay, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.
[18:47.610 --> 18:48.350]  We're going south.
[18:48.430 --> 18:49.210]  That's not good.
[18:50.150 --> 18:50.710]  That's fine.
[18:50.770 --> 18:52.630]  Just get in the water and then it'll take you.
[18:52.930 --> 18:53.410]  You just gotta go.
[18:54.130 --> 18:54.910]  I am going.
[18:54.910 --> 18:56.490]  It's taking me to the east.
[18:57.030 --> 18:57.870]  Oh, that's okay.
[18:57.930 --> 18:58.670]  Just cut left.
[18:58.830 --> 18:59.010]  All right.
[18:59.910 --> 19:00.890]  Okay, I'm back here.
[19:01.750 --> 19:04.010]  The camera was lost for a minute.
[19:04.590 --> 19:05.990]  Yeah, it was so far from me.
[19:07.510 --> 19:10.090]  So when you get to land, Nick, will you look at where you're at?
[19:10.150 --> 19:11.530]  I'm curious to see just on the map.
[19:11.530 --> 19:12.410]  Are you curious?
[19:12.550 --> 19:13.870]  We're in the southeast most part of the map.
[19:13.890 --> 19:15.850]  I'm really curious about where you might be.
[19:16.310 --> 19:16.910]  Oh, okay.
[19:17.090 --> 19:18.070]  Oh, that's actually...
[19:18.070 --> 19:19.050]  You just have to go west.
[19:19.390 --> 19:20.470]  You're on Secret Island.
[19:21.070 --> 19:22.310]  Yeah, you can just go west.
[19:22.530 --> 19:22.930]  That's easy.
[19:22.930 --> 19:24.910]  I thought this was way worse than that.
[19:25.030 --> 19:25.490]  Okay, great.
[19:25.590 --> 19:26.870]  We're in a perfect position.
[19:27.090 --> 19:27.490]  Yeah, you're set.
[19:27.570 --> 19:28.510]  And you got a gun now.
[19:28.810 --> 19:29.710]  And I got a gun.
[19:30.130 --> 19:31.450]  Just do a double island leap.
[19:31.750 --> 19:32.250]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:32.530 --> 19:33.110]  Looking pretty good.
[19:33.130 --> 19:33.810]  All right, let's hit the bridge.
[19:35.130 --> 19:36.390]  Is this the right bridge?
[19:37.690 --> 19:38.310]  Let's find out.
[19:39.870 --> 19:40.710]  Not even close.
[19:40.930 --> 19:41.170]  No.
[19:41.830 --> 19:42.190]  Cool.
[19:43.270 --> 19:45.150]  Well, it could be if I went further south.
[19:45.210 --> 19:45.450]  Yeah.
[19:47.270 --> 19:47.790]  Jump, Nico.
[19:47.790 --> 19:47.910]  Go.
[19:52.530 --> 19:53.630]  Let's take a look around.
[19:53.870 --> 19:54.490]  All right, look both ways.
[19:54.590 --> 19:54.970]  We're crossing.
[19:55.390 --> 19:57.370]  I like it so much more when there's no police.
[19:58.190 --> 19:59.350]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[19:59.990 --> 20:00.310]  No!
[20:02.110 --> 20:02.750]  What happened?
[20:03.270 --> 20:03.590]  No!
[20:06.650 --> 20:07.170]  He's back.
[20:07.270 --> 20:08.350]  All right, let's take a look.
[20:09.990 --> 20:10.470]  Oh, look, a car.
[20:10.570 --> 20:10.970]  You got a car.
[20:11.650 --> 20:13.670]  Oh, it starts you right there with a car.
[20:13.730 --> 20:14.230]  You better go.
[20:14.770 --> 20:16.150]  All right, now you just gotta go a little north.
[20:18.750 --> 20:19.670]  That's just...
[20:22.550 --> 20:23.450]  Oh, no, east.
[20:23.550 --> 20:24.830]  Oh, god!
[20:25.150 --> 20:25.610]  Immediately.
[20:27.990 --> 20:29.090]  You're going to the airport.
[20:32.310 --> 20:36.650]  I feel like you getting cars is constantly a disaster.
[20:36.950 --> 20:37.640]  Yeah, I think...
[20:39.230 --> 20:41.630]  We have to rely on the kindness of strangers here.
[20:41.730 --> 20:43.070]  You better hope there's a fucking boat.
[20:44.970 --> 20:45.750]  Look at that.
[20:48.110 --> 20:49.230]  Oh, shit.
[20:50.030 --> 20:52.230]  That is fucking awesome.
[20:53.750 --> 20:56.490]  That is so fucking cool.
[20:56.490 --> 20:57.630]  Oh, this is raining.
[21:01.900 --> 21:02.460]  Jesus.
[21:05.600 --> 21:11.260]  When I was a kid, there was a series of like Sunday movies that would come on about a guy
[21:11.260 --> 21:14.460]  who had a stopwatch with like one hour of time on it.
[21:14.740 --> 21:18.060]  And anytime he hit the stopwatch, as long as it was paused,
[21:18.060 --> 21:19.580]  the time would stop.
[21:19.740 --> 21:23.020]  But whenever the stopwatch ended, the power was gone.
[21:23.620 --> 21:26.340]  Yeah, and he would like save people and stuff.
[21:27.040 --> 21:29.900]  There was a kid's show on CITV, I think, called Bernard's Watch.
[21:30.140 --> 21:35.680]  And he always did really good stuff when he stopped time instead of like robbing banks and shit.
[21:35.800 --> 21:37.140]  Yeah, it was the same kind of thing.
[21:37.240 --> 21:39.780]  It was like he would write the wrongs and stuff, help people out.
[21:42.180 --> 21:45.380]  I'd like to think Gavin, you and I would do that if we had that watch.
[21:46.140 --> 21:46.740]  Write wrongs?
[21:46.800 --> 21:47.040]  Yeah.
[21:47.600 --> 21:48.280]  Oh, definitely.
[21:48.520 --> 21:52.420]  I mean, I'd obviously use the first 20 or so minutes to really screw around.
[21:52.580 --> 21:54.080]  I would pants every guy I know.
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.560]  But then I would write a lot of wrongs.
[21:56.640 --> 21:57.060]  All right.
[21:57.780 --> 21:59.600]  Geoff would validate his gentle ghost.
[22:01.700 --> 22:02.920]  I would become the gentle ghost.
[22:03.200 --> 22:06.980]  I'd find out that the gentle ghost was me in the future with a fucking stopwatch.
[22:07.680 --> 22:09.300]  You got a time-traveling stopwatch.
[22:09.840 --> 22:12.980]  Nick, you're facing a road that's gonna twat you straight back into the sea.
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.840]  I just don't like...
[22:13.840 --> 22:14.360]  Oh, you're right.
[22:15.040 --> 22:15.400]  See, look.
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.240]  I was asking you guys.
[22:17.240 --> 22:17.720]  What would you do?
[22:17.920 --> 22:18.600]  What do you mean, ask?
[22:18.640 --> 22:19.460]  You're playing, dude.
[22:19.580 --> 22:20.660]  I want to know what you want to do.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.140]  Go northwest.
[22:21.140 --> 22:22.240]  You gotta go straight to your spot.
[22:22.800 --> 22:23.000]  Okay.
[22:24.100 --> 22:25.260]  Oh, this is perfect right here.
[22:25.340 --> 22:28.060]  Always be headed northwest and you'll be fine.
[22:30.060 --> 22:32.320]  North? Well, yeah, mostly west right now, but yes.
[22:32.520 --> 22:32.680]  Yeah.
[22:33.440 --> 22:33.760]  Yeah.
[22:35.020 --> 22:36.120]  Oh, that was close.
[22:36.460 --> 22:40.180]  If you head south or east, that would be wrong.
[22:41.400 --> 22:41.880]  Got it.
[22:43.500 --> 22:45.720]  Yeah, let the traffic know that that would be wrong.
[22:46.700 --> 22:47.520]  Lots of cash.
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.120]  All right, let's go this way.
[22:49.260 --> 22:50.780]  Cool, it's really gonna be helping you out in this one.
[22:53.340 --> 22:53.660]  Hey!
[22:55.300 --> 22:57.140]  See, now you're figuring it out.
[22:57.300 --> 22:58.140]  Now, see, they're helping you.
[22:58.140 --> 22:58.720]  I got it.
[22:58.800 --> 22:59.580]  I told you, I got it.
[22:59.600 --> 23:00.920]  It's like hitting a boost pad in Mario Kart.
[23:01.500 --> 23:02.160]  Yep, come on.
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.420]  Right into the fucking building.
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.560]  I'm gonna land it on you.
[23:11.700 --> 23:13.460]  This is such a great spot to get hit.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.840]  Yeah, this will be better because I think it'll let me fly a little further.
[23:16.900 --> 23:20.980]  Just stay in this lane and eventually somebody's gonna whack you.
[23:22.180 --> 23:23.400]  I just keep walking though.
[23:23.660 --> 23:25.020]  I think you just gotta keep going, dude.
[23:25.240 --> 23:26.320]  Yeah, I wouldn't stand still.
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.720]  No, you've been standing still a lot and it hasn't been working for you.
[23:29.900 --> 23:31.280]  Yeah, everything that you've been doing...
[23:31.280 --> 23:31.660]  There you go.
[23:33.220 --> 23:34.380]  Get a little closer.
[23:34.380 --> 23:34.860]  Whoa!
[23:35.880 --> 23:36.800]  Oh, come on!
[23:37.020 --> 23:37.840]  That's the wrong way.
[23:38.300 --> 23:40.060]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[23:40.060 --> 23:41.400]  What do we say about south and east?
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.640]  Yeah, I thought we were really clear about north and west.
[23:45.200 --> 23:46.920]  How come there's no west parking cars?
[23:48.640 --> 23:49.480]  Oh no, oh no.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.220]  Get out of the way.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.760]  Wrong lane, wrong lane.
[23:52.860 --> 23:53.520]  Wrong lane!
[23:53.740 --> 23:55.620]  See, that was a bad lane move, dude.
[23:58.140 --> 23:58.940]  That's south.
[23:59.500 --> 24:01.320]  Okay, all right, all right, okay, all right, west.
[24:01.760 --> 24:02.740]  Oh, no fire engine there.
[24:03.040 --> 24:03.480]  That's a shame.
[24:04.040 --> 24:06.100]  Don't pick up the cash!
[24:06.360 --> 24:07.040]  It's not real money.
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.420]  It doesn't do anything!
[24:08.900 --> 24:11.580]  It's as useless as my UFC 5 prize winnings.
[24:12.260 --> 24:12.460]  Whoa!
[24:13.220 --> 24:14.100]  All right, send me flying.
[24:14.320 --> 24:15.120]  It's not even a road.
[24:15.600 --> 24:16.140]  You're right.
[24:17.320 --> 24:19.220]  He's in a stairwell.
[24:19.520 --> 24:20.800]  All right, send me flying.
[24:22.280 --> 24:23.340]  I've been hitting worse spots.
[24:23.580 --> 24:25.320]  Oh, well, you're facing east.
[24:27.260 --> 24:28.700]  All right, where are we?
[24:29.600 --> 24:30.120]  Okay.
[24:31.320 --> 24:32.620]  We've been around six blocks.
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.200]  All right, F this.
[24:35.420 --> 24:36.740]  Oh, okay, we'll hit the bridge.
[24:37.000 --> 24:37.820]  You just told your neighborhood.
[24:40.000 --> 24:40.540]  Oh, that's bad.
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.220]  Oh, my God!
[24:41.380 --> 24:42.380]  Where did that noise come from?
[24:42.500 --> 24:43.580]  That was an excellent dodge, though.
[24:44.340 --> 24:44.860]  Hey, thank you.
[24:46.000 --> 24:46.360]  Holy...
[24:47.720 --> 24:50.720]  You got a lot of room to go north here.
[24:51.500 --> 24:51.780]  Stairs!
[24:52.380 --> 24:52.740]  Go!
[24:54.020 --> 24:54.780]  You can do it!
[24:54.800 --> 24:55.600]  Oh, no, that's...
[24:55.600 --> 24:56.460]  Oh, no, I'm going south.
[24:56.660 --> 24:57.180]  You can do it!
[24:57.220 --> 24:57.420]  I'm going south!
[24:57.720 --> 24:58.420]  Oh, I made it!
[24:58.880 --> 24:59.240]  Woo!
[24:59.460 --> 24:59.820]  Woo!
[25:00.020 --> 25:00.380]  Woo!
[25:00.420 --> 25:00.780]  Woo!
[25:00.920 --> 25:00.980]  Woo!
[25:01.160 --> 25:01.520]  Woo!
[25:02.080 --> 25:03.020]  What a hit!
[25:03.680 --> 25:04.580]  What a hit!
[25:06.100 --> 25:06.940]  The thud.
[25:07.420 --> 25:08.080]  It worked.
[25:09.820 --> 25:11.100]  Now you just gotta keep it going.
[25:11.900 --> 25:12.080]  Yeah.
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.960]  There shouldn't be any traffic because you shouldn't be there.
[25:16.760 --> 25:17.160]  Heck yeah.
[25:17.760 --> 25:19.080]  Because the game has deemed it so.
[25:19.460 --> 25:20.400]  Although, what's that car?
[25:21.540 --> 25:22.360]  Cops, probably?
[25:23.280 --> 25:25.460]  The second you get that wanted level, call that fucker in.
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.060]  What was the reason they gave you a wanted level for this?
[25:29.100 --> 25:29.540]  Uh...
[25:29.540 --> 25:32.300]  To keep you off of the islands before you could get there.
[25:32.880 --> 25:35.260]  Yeah, just like plot-wise, how does that make any sense?
[25:35.660 --> 25:38.360]  Uh, they closed the bridges due to terrorist attacks.
[25:39.340 --> 25:40.140]  Oh, right, right, right.
[25:40.380 --> 25:40.600]  Okay.
[25:41.560 --> 25:42.000]  Number?
[25:43.160 --> 25:43.600]  Two.
[25:45.800 --> 25:46.560]  Six, seven.
[25:47.100 --> 25:49.920]  Five, five, five.
[25:50.980 --> 25:52.620]  Zero, one, zero, zero.
[25:54.240 --> 25:54.680]  Oh...
[25:54.680 --> 25:54.960]  No!
[25:55.640 --> 25:56.400]  Damn you!
[25:56.980 --> 25:57.960]  No, it wasn't me!
[25:58.060 --> 25:59.100]  It was Niko!
[25:59.340 --> 26:01.560]  He got too close to the ledge and freaked out!
[26:01.780 --> 26:03.260]  You can't spell Niko without Nick.
[26:04.020 --> 26:04.600]  Uh, that's true.
[26:04.940 --> 26:05.500]  All right, two.
[26:06.300 --> 26:06.900]  Six, seven.
[26:07.580 --> 26:08.340]  Six, seven.
[26:08.760 --> 26:09.120]  Five, five, five.
[26:09.120 --> 26:09.820]  Five, five, five.
[26:10.340 --> 26:11.140]  Give it right back to zero.
[26:11.140 --> 26:11.940]  Zero, one, zero, zero.
[26:12.500 --> 26:12.860]  One.
[26:14.240 --> 26:14.640]  Zero, zero.
[26:14.860 --> 26:16.100]  I don't know if that's the number.
[26:16.320 --> 26:17.020]  That's what I remember.
[26:17.460 --> 26:18.080]  But we'll see.
[26:19.920 --> 26:21.440]  Oh, wow, that was the number?
[26:21.740 --> 26:22.680]  That one, I memorized that.
[26:22.700 --> 26:23.320]  I didn't even look it up.
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.800]  Hey, Nick, you got a wanted level again.
[26:25.240 --> 26:26.040]  Hey, it's back instantly.
[26:26.420 --> 26:27.080]  Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[26:27.260 --> 26:27.840]  You're still on the bridge.
[26:27.840 --> 26:30.000]  Should have been on the other side for this.
[26:31.140 --> 26:33.340]  There's a, there's a, there's a tram?
[26:45.100 --> 26:46.120]  That's the thumbnail.
[26:47.740 --> 26:48.460]  Oh, man.
[26:49.160 --> 26:50.360]  That was incredible.
[26:50.560 --> 26:51.280]  Holy shit.
[26:52.480 --> 26:53.180]  44 minutes in.
[26:53.180 --> 26:54.240]  Ross, you gotta go north, buddy.
[26:55.140 --> 26:56.240]  All right, Nick, stop dicking around.
[26:56.300 --> 26:56.860]  Make some progress.
[26:57.020 --> 26:57.760]  Yeah, all right, here we go.
[26:58.540 --> 26:59.200]  Yeah, you're right.
[26:59.240 --> 26:59.580]  I'm sorry.
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.920]  All right, here's what we're gonna do.
[27:02.080 --> 27:02.760]  Get in the car.
[27:02.980 --> 27:03.820]  You'll be safe in the car.
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.160]  Get in the car.
[27:04.500 --> 27:04.720]  Uh-huh.
[27:05.060 --> 27:08.140]  I'm gonna back it up and just drive full speed to the other side.
[27:08.160 --> 27:08.560]  Oh, there you go.
[27:08.560 --> 27:08.960]  Oh, okay.
[27:09.420 --> 27:09.740]  Yeah.
[27:11.060 --> 27:11.200]  Oh.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.700]  Did a man just fall out of that tree?
[27:14.020 --> 27:15.760]  Okay, he's gonna just back this up, Gavin.
[27:17.040 --> 27:18.860]  He's just gonna back, he's gonna back it up.
[27:19.460 --> 27:19.760]  There you go.
[27:19.960 --> 27:20.020]  Easy peasy.
[27:20.440 --> 27:20.660]  Yep.
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.400]  This is great.
[27:21.560 --> 27:22.120]  This is great.
[27:22.780 --> 27:23.560]  Go tease it.
[27:23.780 --> 27:24.100]  Further back.
[27:25.460 --> 27:26.160]  Tease at it.
[27:27.000 --> 27:27.580]  That's too much.
[27:28.080 --> 27:28.640]  That's too much.
[27:28.640 --> 27:29.340]  Nick, that's south.
[27:29.580 --> 27:30.520]  That is way too much, dude.
[27:30.840 --> 27:32.040]  No, this is east, Eric.
[27:32.120 --> 27:32.600]  This is east.
[27:32.740 --> 27:33.220]  Oh, here we go.
[27:33.540 --> 27:34.100]  Back west.
[27:34.320 --> 27:34.760]  Oh, there we go.
[27:34.760 --> 27:35.460]  Now we're going west.
[27:35.540 --> 27:36.160]  This is good.
[27:36.500 --> 27:37.100]  You should jump out.
[27:37.100 --> 27:37.560]  Look at this.
[27:37.820 --> 27:38.920]  You need to jump out now.
[27:39.020 --> 27:39.280]  This is great.
[27:39.400 --> 27:40.340]  No, no, don't even get out.
[27:40.400 --> 27:40.800]  Don't get out.
[27:40.960 --> 27:41.280]  Don't get out.
[27:41.360 --> 27:41.740]  Are you serious?
[27:42.080 --> 27:42.660]  Don't listen to him.
[27:42.720 --> 27:44.020]  You guys are crazy.
[27:44.380 --> 27:45.260]  No, you gotta ride it out.
[27:45.320 --> 27:45.600]  Look at this.
[27:45.620 --> 27:47.140]  I'm gonna hit the tower right on the edge.
[27:47.400 --> 27:47.920]  He's fine.
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.000]  He's fine.
[27:49.500 --> 27:50.240]  Oh, I'm gonna bounce again.
[27:50.320 --> 27:50.620]  Here we go.
[27:50.700 --> 27:50.860]  You ready?
[27:50.860 --> 27:52.180]  To the island you need to hit to.
[27:52.180 --> 27:52.880]  Go, go, go.
[27:53.100 --> 27:53.500]  Yes!
[27:53.680 --> 27:54.060]  Yeah!
[27:54.800 --> 27:55.540]  Oh, no!
[27:56.800 --> 27:57.780]  All right, now, now.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.100]  Oh, no.
[27:58.440 --> 27:58.680]  I'm gonna ride it out.
[27:59.180 --> 27:59.960]  I'm gonna ride it out.
[28:00.280 --> 28:01.280]  Great job, Nick.
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.440]  You got so...
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.420]  Oh, that was awesome.
[28:03.820 --> 28:04.540]  I take it back.
[28:04.720 --> 28:05.460]  That was incredible.
[28:05.940 --> 28:06.360]  Holy shit.
[28:06.360 --> 28:07.800]  That car's already back on the first island.
[28:08.960 --> 28:12.400]  Look, how close are we now?
[28:12.580 --> 28:12.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:12.900 --> 28:13.740]  So where are we, Nick?
[28:14.300 --> 28:16.200]  Oh, the closest we've been.
[28:16.400 --> 28:16.940]  The whole time.
[28:16.940 --> 28:17.280]  All right.
[28:17.320 --> 28:17.720]  The whole time.
[28:17.760 --> 28:18.300]  No cars.
[28:18.800 --> 28:19.220]  Just east.
[28:19.220 --> 28:20.340]  Just haul ass north.
[28:20.860 --> 28:21.840]  You should call that number.
[28:22.560 --> 28:24.200]  Hide behind the trash can and call the number.
[28:25.000 --> 28:25.060]  Yeah.
[28:25.180 --> 28:25.620]  It doesn't work.
[28:26.580 --> 28:27.280]  Oh, yeah, he's right.
[28:27.360 --> 28:27.960]  It'll just keep...
[28:27.960 --> 28:28.780]  It'll just keep going.
[28:28.900 --> 28:29.060]  Oh.
[28:29.700 --> 28:30.300]  Oh, really?
[28:30.900 --> 28:32.420]  Yeah, because we're in an area where it's supposed to be.
[28:32.560 --> 28:33.580]  So it just keeps...
[28:33.580 --> 28:33.960]  Ow!
[28:34.120 --> 28:34.980]  Run, run, run.
[28:36.820 --> 28:38.140]  Remo Williams, dodge the bullets.
[28:39.060 --> 28:39.600]  Here we go.
[28:39.780 --> 28:39.920]  Oh.
[28:40.840 --> 28:41.160]  What?
[28:41.440 --> 28:41.580]  No.
[28:42.960 --> 28:44.240]  Here we go, brick wall.
[28:44.420 --> 28:45.340]  Like a fucking...
[28:46.720 --> 28:47.040]  And...
[28:47.040 --> 28:47.220]  Wall.
[28:48.080 --> 28:48.920]  That's all, folks.
[28:50.860 --> 28:52.440]  Remember that cop that shot the hot dog guy?
[28:52.940 --> 28:55.000]  Oh, that poor hot dog guy.
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.100]  Is there a hot dog guy?
[28:57.420 --> 28:58.480]  I don't want to do that.
[28:58.580 --> 28:58.820]  Do you?
[29:01.040 --> 29:02.080]  I'm all for it.
[29:03.980 --> 29:04.640]  Yeah, there's one.
[29:04.720 --> 29:05.100]  Look at it.
[29:05.140 --> 29:05.340]  It looks...
[29:05.980 --> 29:07.320]  That guy's pinned to the wall.
[29:07.820 --> 29:08.440]  Oh, it's perfect.
[29:08.640 --> 29:09.480]  It's the perfect car.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.800]  Oh, my God.
[29:13.220 --> 29:15.120]  I didn't know cars could get that destroyed.
[29:15.240 --> 29:16.220]  Would it even work?
[29:17.300 --> 29:17.700]  I...
[29:17.700 --> 29:18.300]  Okay, well, let's...
[29:18.840 --> 29:20.180]  There's a cop right there.
[29:20.180 --> 29:20.960]  There's too many cops.
[29:21.740 --> 29:22.680]  You're going to get arrested.
[29:23.360 --> 29:29.360]  Okay, so, Geoff, what you just saw is what happens in all of our fucking heists.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.880]  Nick is in a direction.
[29:32.300 --> 29:33.260]  We are so close.
[29:33.500 --> 29:35.100]  And Gavin goes, but what if?
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.780]  And then it all gets fucked.
[29:38.420 --> 29:39.400]  It all gets...
[29:39.400 --> 29:42.120]  We almost just saw Nick go back to the beginning.
[29:42.640 --> 29:43.440]  Ooh, a van.
[29:44.640 --> 29:44.980]  That's interesting.
[29:44.980 --> 29:45.380]  Getting there.
[29:45.460 --> 29:45.940]  Oh, there's a van.
[29:45.940 --> 29:46.760]  Gotta be careful.
[29:46.900 --> 29:47.140]  Perfect.
[29:47.780 --> 29:48.940]  You just turned away from the van.
[29:49.760 --> 29:50.440]  No, no.
[29:50.580 --> 29:51.440]  Look at that van.
[29:51.660 --> 29:52.180]  Look at it.
[29:52.180 --> 29:53.040]  Look at this.
[29:53.440 --> 29:53.980]  It's beautiful.
[29:53.980 --> 29:54.620]  Just spin on this.
[29:54.940 --> 29:56.020]  Just spin on this.
[29:56.340 --> 29:57.000]  Now, what do you do?
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.900]  You go forward and just chance or do you back it up?
[29:58.900 --> 30:01.140]  Yeah, just hope the wall helps me out.
[30:01.460 --> 30:01.820]  It didn't.
[30:03.080 --> 30:04.340]  It's a lot of wall, man.
[30:05.140 --> 30:05.360]  Yeah.
[30:06.380 --> 30:07.000]  Oh, the car's dead.
[30:07.420 --> 30:07.740]  All right.
[30:08.000 --> 30:08.860]  Climb up the ladder.
[30:09.860 --> 30:11.500]  See if the wall helps me.
[30:11.680 --> 30:13.620]  Look, it's fucking smashed.
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.900]  Go up the ladder!
[30:15.220 --> 30:15.620]  God!
[30:17.300 --> 30:18.100]  Oh, that's...
[30:18.100 --> 30:18.880]  Oh, that was a good climb.
[30:19.940 --> 30:20.900]  Oh, man.
[30:21.260 --> 30:22.040]  Oh, fuck.
[30:22.180 --> 30:23.440]  I'll just throw yourself over.
[30:23.860 --> 30:24.340]  Yeah.
[30:24.420 --> 30:25.160]  You got it.
[30:25.960 --> 30:27.140]  Hey, you nailed that.
[30:27.260 --> 30:27.760]  Oh, nice.
[30:31.960 --> 30:33.200]  You're almost there, Gally.
[30:33.220 --> 30:33.900]  So close.
[30:33.940 --> 30:34.620]  You're so close.
[30:34.620 --> 30:34.760]  I know.
[30:35.380 --> 30:36.220]  Oh, it's a church.
[30:36.320 --> 30:37.280]  My salvation is near.
[30:39.760 --> 30:40.980]  It doesn't sound like hers is.
[30:43.000 --> 30:43.480]  Oh.
[30:43.680 --> 30:44.620]  Oh, you're so...
[30:44.620 --> 30:44.880]  Oh, you're...
[30:44.880 --> 30:45.360]  You're there.
[30:45.520 --> 30:47.300]  Dude, you're practically there.
[30:47.320 --> 30:48.160]  Oh, I see the green.
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.900]  You better get to that.
[30:49.980 --> 30:51.040]  You turn that jug back over.
[30:55.100 --> 30:55.920]  I hear him.
[30:55.960 --> 30:56.860]  I don't see the police.
[30:58.560 --> 30:59.500]  Oh, he's stuck in there.
[30:59.520 --> 31:00.420]  You really gotta work on your cardio.
[31:01.580 --> 31:02.200]  Yeah, I know.
[31:07.140 --> 31:07.380]  Huh.
[31:07.720 --> 31:09.060]  Why are you serpentining?
[31:09.280 --> 31:10.480]  Why are you serpentining?
[31:10.880 --> 31:11.340]  What are you serpentining?
[31:11.340 --> 31:12.400]  They can't hit me if I...
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.060]  I don't know.
[31:13.460 --> 31:14.900]  I was seeing if I could get traffic to spawn.
[31:16.440 --> 31:16.760]  That's...
[31:16.760 --> 31:16.980]  Yeah.
[31:17.500 --> 31:18.040]  No, I like it.
[31:18.060 --> 31:18.520]  Keep doing it.
[31:18.840 --> 31:19.160]  What's...
[31:19.160 --> 31:20.120]  He's like an F1 driver.
[31:20.940 --> 31:23.380]  What's the difference between me playing it and Nick playing it?
[31:25.440 --> 31:31.260]  I feel like you had a constant sense of where you were trying to go.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.160]  Nick keeps trying to pick up money.
[31:35.020 --> 31:39.460]  Nick is also susceptible to you in a way that you're not susceptible to you.
[31:39.840 --> 31:41.460]  That is absolutely true.
[31:42.240 --> 31:42.960]  My one weakness.
[31:46.580 --> 31:47.760]  Are you almost there?
[31:47.960 --> 31:48.340]  What was that?
[31:48.460 --> 31:49.360]  You're gonna make it.
[31:49.360 --> 31:51.280]  Yeah, he's definitely gonna make it.
[31:52.120 --> 31:52.480]  Go.
[31:52.640 --> 31:53.020]  Look at that.
[31:53.060 --> 31:54.260]  It's fucking easy at this point.
[31:54.440 --> 31:55.360]  That's the big jug.
[31:57.220 --> 31:58.300]  Oh, you're almost there.
[31:59.080 --> 32:01.540]  Man, it's such a bummer that it despawns traffic on this thing.
[32:01.540 --> 32:01.680]  Yeah.
[32:03.140 --> 32:04.640]  I'll have to play the game, I guess.
[32:05.820 --> 32:06.500]  Who has...
[32:06.500 --> 32:09.520]  Who has a save file in GTA 4 that has all the...
[32:09.520 --> 32:09.760]  I do.
[32:10.120 --> 32:11.220]  Well, you do clearly, but...
[32:12.920 --> 32:13.640]  Only Gavin.
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.300]  Okay.
[32:15.340 --> 32:16.740]  I could probably just send it to you.
[32:16.840 --> 32:17.000]  Yeah.
[32:17.160 --> 32:17.660]  Yeah, you could try.
[32:17.660 --> 32:20.080]  That way, it would be cooler to do this again, but you know...
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.160]  All right, this is it.
[32:23.160 --> 32:24.400]  Have access to the...
[32:24.400 --> 32:25.940]  Oh, this is multiplayer starting area.
[32:27.220 --> 32:27.780]  Oh, wow!
[32:27.980 --> 32:28.380]  Oh, yes!
[32:28.440 --> 32:29.000]  How crazy.
[32:29.540 --> 32:30.180]  How appropriate.
[32:30.460 --> 32:33.060]  Oh, I guess the jug was pouring out multiplayer good times.
[32:33.780 --> 32:34.360]  Hell yeah.
[32:35.440 --> 32:36.280]  Oh, let's get the roof.
[32:36.920 --> 32:37.160]  Hell yeah, dude.
[32:37.160 --> 32:38.940]  See if you can find us shooting each other in the lobby.
[32:39.860 --> 32:40.300]  All right.
[32:41.200 --> 32:42.020]  Let's go have a look.
[32:42.920 --> 32:43.240]  Nick!
[32:44.260 --> 32:44.900]  You did it!
[32:44.900 --> 32:45.740]  I'm proud of you, you did it.
[32:46.020 --> 32:46.660]  I cannot believe it.
[32:46.660 --> 32:46.980]  I did it!
[32:48.660 --> 32:49.640]  Phenomenal job, Nick.
[32:50.000 --> 32:50.360]  Congratulations.
[32:50.360 --> 32:50.860]  Thank you.
[32:51.500 --> 32:52.960]  Never doubted me for a second, right?
[32:53.440 --> 32:54.100]  Something like that.
[32:54.240 --> 32:56.860]  How did it feel to play this mode?
[32:57.580 --> 32:58.300]  Pretty stressful.
[32:58.780 --> 32:59.360]  Very fun.
[33:04.720 --> 33:05.700]  It was great.
[33:05.840 --> 33:06.240]  I loved it.
[33:06.680 --> 33:06.960]  That's good.
[33:07.020 --> 33:09.760]  Why don't you go push a couple of cops around for a little while and...
[33:09.760 --> 33:10.400]  Yeah, you got it.
[33:10.400 --> 33:11.020]  While we take it out.
[33:11.480 --> 33:12.460]  For Hot Dog Man!
[33:14.320 --> 33:15.820]  Yeah, let's avenge his death.
[33:16.460 --> 33:16.740]  Yeah.
[33:18.160 --> 33:19.420]  Oh, I didn't think he was gonna let you jump.
[33:21.280 --> 33:22.460]  You've reached your destination!
[33:24.120 --> 33:25.120]  Way to go.
[33:25.980 --> 33:27.720]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[33:31.620 --> 33:33.820]  You're punching a guy with Kevlar armor on.
[33:34.180 --> 33:36.600]  Let us know in the comments where we should...
[33:36.600 --> 33:37.380]  I don't got it on his face.
[33:37.640 --> 33:39.140]  What we should try for next.
[33:39.400 --> 33:41.460]  Because it's definitely gonna be...
[33:41.460 --> 33:42.540]  We gotta do this again.
[33:42.880 --> 33:44.360]  We gotta do it fully unlocked.
[33:44.860 --> 33:45.300]  Yeah, and...
[33:45.900 --> 33:47.540]  But we have to find some new destinations.
[33:47.540 --> 33:48.280]  Some different stuff.
[33:48.380 --> 33:50.360]  So let us know in the comments where we should go next.
[33:50.420 --> 33:51.240]  What we should do.
[33:52.240 --> 33:56.780]  I wonder if there's a way to land on top of the Empire State without using a helicopter.
[33:57.020 --> 33:57.600]  You think so?
[33:57.960 --> 33:59.060]  Like using a boat.
[33:59.660 --> 33:59.960]  Yeah.
[34:00.100 --> 34:01.220]  Using a boat or a car.
[34:03.240 --> 34:04.400]  Oh, you punched his lap.
[34:04.780 --> 34:05.220]  I did.
[34:06.260 --> 34:06.900]  Let's see.
[34:07.840 --> 34:08.940]  You gave him a lap tap.
[34:09.940 --> 34:10.220]  Yep.
[34:10.660 --> 34:13.200]  Well, go to HotDogManPatreon.com
[34:13.200 --> 34:14.260]  Now you nailed that, dude.
[34:14.900 --> 34:17.780]  That's not gonna help Gavin's compilation video.
[34:18.000 --> 34:18.360]  No.
[34:18.980 --> 34:19.400]  It's a shame.
[34:20.080 --> 34:21.120]  Next time.
[34:21.400 --> 34:21.860]  All right, guys.
[34:22.020 --> 34:23.100]  We'll see you next time.
[34:23.200 --> 34:23.520]  Bye.
[34:23.880 --> 34:24.020]  Bye.
[34:25.880 --> 34:27.020]  Hot Dog Man!
