[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  Hello everyone! It's the best of friends. There's no need to laugh yet, Nick.
[00:04.880 --> 00:07.640]  Oh no, we missed some stuff beforehand, folks.
[00:08.800 --> 00:13.540]  Okay, I'm a mess, I'm a mess. Anyway, what I've done throughout the- throughout of our
[00:14.040 --> 00:18.160]  heisting career, Regulation Heists, I've been taking little snippets, little clips,
[00:18.840 --> 00:22.560]  and then I go back in and I re-cam them. I add a little bit of slow-mo sometimes,
[00:23.320 --> 00:28.300]  and it's a combination of us being real, really badass in heists,
[00:28.300 --> 00:34.320]  but mainly it's us messing with each other, like driving to a heist or after a heist,
[00:34.420 --> 00:38.720]  so it's a lovely combination of clips. I didn't even know you could do this.
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.280]  I'm excited to see this. Yeah, and he puts slow-mo to it, that's great. It's like your thing.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.740]  Yeah, it is his thing. This is part one and we'll move on to Doomsday in a second part.
[00:47.840 --> 00:51.120]  Oh, I have a question. Yeah. You say the best of the original heist,
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.240]  are there clips in this that have not come out yet, as far as videos go?
[00:56.700 --> 01:00.500]  Uh, yes, but this will come out after those. Okay, yeah, I figured as much. I was just curious,
[01:00.740 --> 01:04.340]  like, is this the full range? Is this from what has been released? At the end of this,
[01:04.400 --> 01:11.120]  I put a little, uh, like a coming soon clip. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. That's great.
[01:11.360 --> 01:16.200]  One more disclaimer, I can only move the camera in the Rockstar editor about 30 feet away from me,
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.880]  so if you're, if you're not near me, I can't film it. Okay, got it. Okay, let's do it. Three, two,
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.980]  one, play. There you go. Good call. Good call. Yeah. There he is. Powerful.
[01:29.460 --> 01:33.080]  Standing on the mountain. Look at him. Is he about to die? Majestic. All the land for him.
[01:35.100 --> 01:36.840]  You got the rain coming down?
[01:39.180 --> 01:46.140]  It's a real, it's a real beauty. This is a music video. No! Oh, no! Oh! Oh, my god.
[01:46.140 --> 01:57.120]  Ready, boys? Oh! Oh, my god. No! Oh, the propeller hit him in the dick. I think it's gonna be
[01:57.120 --> 02:00.860]  interesting to, uh, see if we even remember a lot of these moments. Yeah, no kidding. Because a lot
[02:00.860 --> 02:08.640]  of these, I was like, oh, yeah. Oh, where? Are we? Sounds like a plane maybe? Oh, my god. This stupid,
[02:08.640 --> 02:18.620]  this stupid bike. Oh, I think I remember this. Stupid. I hate it. I hate it so much.
[02:19.800 --> 02:22.640]  I think, uh, Nick hates it more than anyone in this clip. Well,
[02:23.320 --> 02:29.680]  oh, well, I see danger rules of the road. Yeah, I'm just following the rules that you've applied.
[02:29.680 --> 02:40.640]  Oh, my god. Oh, I remember this. Oh, yeah, hanging on to the sides. This was good. Oh, my god. Check
[02:40.640 --> 02:47.440]  out the racket in this. Oh, boy. Look at the squad. Full squad. Between the heights. Oh, he's so cool.
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.160]  Oh, oh, oh. Oh, god. Eric loved this mission. Oh, no. This,
[02:59.160 --> 03:05.060]  this is the worst. Don't show this to people. The greatest trick I've ever pulled. Don't show this
[03:05.060 --> 03:11.180]  to people. I like that before this clip started, I threw a sticky on Andrew's jet as well. Oh,
[03:11.240 --> 03:16.940]  that's great. I didn't even notice. Oh, that's cool.
[03:20.060 --> 03:25.080]  Where am I going? You got a real knack for this, Gavin. Can we just release a Top Gun 3 trailer?
[03:25.080 --> 03:32.120]  No kidding. Are you going the other way to take off? Okay.
[03:35.820 --> 03:44.940]  Oh, no. Yeah, that's me. I remember this.
[03:47.720 --> 03:50.780]  Hey, you didn't fall off the ship, though.
[03:50.780 --> 03:56.660]  Ah. I think this was, I think there was a lot of frustration in that moment.
[03:57.500 --> 04:02.580]  Uh-oh. Damn, this is Top Gun 3. The camera work is so good. I did a little Top Gunning.
[04:06.190 --> 04:11.690]  Is this? Oh, boy. Is this more trying to, like, scoop people out of the water, I think?
[04:11.950 --> 04:20.970]  Yeah. That's awesome. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Oh, my god. I just burned that guy up. Oh, my god.
[04:25.010 --> 04:25.410]  Goose!
[04:27.770 --> 04:34.050]  Oh, no. God, that looks awesome. This is so cool. Isn't it cool what you can do with a replay? This is a game from the 360. What the fuck?
[04:34.390 --> 04:42.510]  This is insane. Oh, did I just take you out? Because I smashed into all the debris, but I somehow lived. Oh, you did.
[04:42.930 --> 04:47.350]  Wow. You survived it. Because you definitely died on one run. Wow, what a save. Oh, yeah.
[04:47.890 --> 04:50.690]  That's another thing, is that I can't save a clip. Oh, this is...
[04:50.690 --> 05:00.830]  Is Andrew having fun? Snubboy! Oh, no. Oh, no. Did you realize we're recording? Snubboy!
[05:01.450 --> 05:12.690]  I can only take clips if I don't die, so sometimes good stuff happens, but I can't take the clip in time.
[05:14.070 --> 05:16.650]  Here it comes. He's driving by.
[05:20.070 --> 05:22.270]  Full squad of the chopper. Nice.
[05:24.990 --> 05:27.890]  Oh, except for Andrew, who's driving somewhere.
[05:29.150 --> 05:32.690]  Oh, yeah. Andrew pisses off a lot. He's not into a lot of these clips, to be honest. Yep.
[05:33.910 --> 05:38.790]  Well, for the future, I want to be in the cool footage. Oh, my god.
[05:44.730 --> 05:52.490]  Because Andrew wasn't in the chopper, nobody was in the rocket. Yeah, so we just had to shoot with little guns. Yeah.
[05:58.430 --> 06:00.210]  Did we get him? Oh, my god.
[06:00.370 --> 06:06.610]  Oh, his dick on the side. Hey, it's me. That looks unwieldy that way.
[06:07.070 --> 06:08.790]  Oh, no.
[06:11.530 --> 06:16.650]  God, that is just tripping on your own dick. Jesus Christ.
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.050]  I had that coming.
[06:18.050 --> 06:27.310]  So much of this is just messing with civilians or each other. They're completely outside of the heist.
[06:31.970 --> 06:33.970]  Dance, stop hitting me.
[06:36.450 --> 06:40.250]  Just you in the hospital. I just wanted to dance. I was just trying to dance.
[06:40.250 --> 06:40.890]  No!
[06:45.010 --> 06:46.850]  Let the rat dance.
[06:51.150 --> 06:54.270]  Uh-oh. Oh, no. Oh, oh.
[06:56.190 --> 06:58.510]  Flying into the walls.
[06:59.650 --> 07:02.450]  Deadnade the grenade.
[07:04.930 --> 07:05.610]  Yeah!
[07:10.330 --> 07:16.890]  Oh, my god. This really just sums up heists for us. Is this an ambulance? What is this? Oh, my god.
[07:22.130 --> 07:30.930]  Oh, this rocks. Uh-oh. I remember this bit. Oh, yeah.
[07:32.110 --> 07:34.250]  Uh-oh. Oh, no.
[07:34.250 --> 07:34.730]  Uh-oh.
[07:37.150 --> 07:40.870]  My heels. Your heels are in the ground.
[07:45.190 --> 07:53.870]  Oh, my god. Holy shit. I'm still in the air, dude.
[07:57.750 --> 08:01.490]  I like how you go off screen here, and then you come back.
[08:04.510 --> 08:06.470]  My deck is broken for sure.
[08:10.470 --> 08:13.150]  Oh, god. I remember this, too.
[08:15.010 --> 08:22.010]  Oh, man. Oh, I remember that. Oh, that's so cool. Oh, did you get that guy up there?
[08:23.250 --> 08:24.870]  Aw, damn. Team Tape!
[08:26.790 --> 08:28.410]  That's the trailer for Team Tape.
[08:34.690 --> 08:36.490]  No, stop. No!
[08:39.550 --> 08:40.350]  My ankle!
[08:42.670 --> 08:44.830]  That's what Eric did to Gavin on his trash can.
[08:45.190 --> 08:47.850]  Yeah, it's true. Made him talk to his neighbor.
[08:49.710 --> 08:50.450]  Pop the hydrant.
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.060]  Uh-oh. Oh, they can swap into the driver's seat.
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.660]  Oh, my god. Wow.
[09:04.300 --> 09:08.860]  Oh, it went so high. Is that how that works? I didn't know you got that high on that. That's crazy.
[09:08.860 --> 09:09.060]  Oh, yeah.
[09:12.720 --> 09:14.420]  Then the rat.
[09:25.660 --> 09:26.600]  Let's go.
[09:29.760 --> 09:33.320]  Oh, no. No. This is gonna be so cool.
[09:40.540 --> 09:41.900]  Oh, no.
[09:42.340 --> 09:44.820]  Oh, no. Oh, no. That guy should really hold on tighter.
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.860]  And there they go.
[09:53.690 --> 09:55.630]  Nick gets hit by the underneath.
[10:01.250 --> 10:02.970]  What the fuck?
[10:03.690 --> 10:06.310]  Holy shit. Just let me die.
[10:08.210 --> 10:12.270]  Oh, that was so cool. Wow. Oh, the cage saved me.
[10:15.330 --> 10:20.090]  We're a disaster. This is an absolute... Oh, my god.
[10:32.970 --> 10:34.970]  Oh, I don't remember this.
[10:39.070 --> 10:44.070]  This is the heist that wouldn't end, isn't it? No.
[10:45.090 --> 10:46.550]  Is this not the road that we were on?
[10:47.150 --> 10:51.770]  That could be. Yeah, but I have my armored car. If we had that, we wouldn't have had a problem. Oh, that's true.
[10:52.750 --> 10:54.490]  Shit. Oh, my god.
[10:58.490 --> 11:04.130]  That was phenomenal. Holy shit. We almost connected. I forgot about that completely.
[11:05.370 --> 11:07.230]  I don't remember this at all.
[11:08.050 --> 11:11.210]  So, this is me driving and I'm behind... I'm behind Eric.
[11:12.150 --> 11:12.450]  Uh-oh.
[11:13.190 --> 11:15.910]  I don't like the way the camera's zooming so much.
[11:18.770 --> 11:21.030]  Oh, my god. This guy. Oh, my god.
[11:21.050 --> 11:22.270]  Who is this guy?
[11:22.270 --> 11:24.490]  Who is this guy?
[11:29.270 --> 11:33.010]  Holy shit. He's still rolling.
[11:36.250 --> 11:40.930]  Wild. Just watch it in the mirror. Yo, that looks crazy back there.
[11:49.130 --> 11:51.510]  Stunt boy. Oh, my god.
[11:55.820 --> 12:00.360]  I don't remember who was in which vehicle with me. Uh-huh. I'm in the red one, though.
[12:02.420 --> 12:06.980]  These are so fun because some of them I remember them instantly. The other ones, I have zero memory. Definitely.
[12:08.660 --> 12:13.840]  It's because we've done so many. There's so many heists we've done together. It's crazy. Oh, my god.
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.900]  Okay. Oh.
[12:18.660 --> 12:19.740]  He's trying to get away.
[12:22.540 --> 12:23.460]  Rules of the road.
[12:26.660 --> 12:27.460]  Uh-oh.
[12:30.860 --> 12:31.700]  Oh, man.
[12:31.900 --> 12:32.600]  Now you. Now you too.
[12:32.980 --> 12:33.380]  Wow.
[12:36.740 --> 12:38.680]  You just made a trailer for this game.
[12:38.920 --> 12:39.080]  Oh, no.
[12:44.810 --> 12:46.450]  I hope they didn't need these vehicles.
[12:48.170 --> 12:49.050]  Oh, my god.
[12:49.250 --> 12:50.050]  I think they needed that one.
[12:51.490 --> 12:52.290]  Oh, shit.
[12:52.590 --> 12:55.050]  I don't even know if those two guys were a part of it.
[12:55.050 --> 12:58.050]  I don't think so.
[12:58.830 --> 12:59.350]  Wow.
[12:59.630 --> 13:00.790]  That was awesome.
[13:02.710 --> 13:04.110]  Watching it like this,
[13:04.210 --> 13:05.790]  I cannot wait for GTA 6.
[13:06.210 --> 13:07.130]  I know, right?
[13:07.210 --> 13:08.410]  I hope they have this feature in there.
[13:08.710 --> 13:09.230]  God.
[13:11.690 --> 13:13.790]  Don't worry. It'll be in there two years
[13:13.790 --> 13:15.430]  after it comes out when online drops.
[13:15.510 --> 13:15.930]  It'll be great.
[13:16.830 --> 13:17.010]  Yeah.
[13:19.350 --> 13:20.350]  Oh, my god.
[13:21.270 --> 13:22.670]  That's really coming in fast.
[13:23.710 --> 13:24.510]  Holy shit.
[13:24.650 --> 13:25.830]  Oh, my god.
[13:28.150 --> 13:28.550]  Wow.
[13:29.030 --> 13:30.990]  What a bunny hop.
[13:36.430 --> 13:37.530]  That's so cool.
[13:39.590 --> 13:40.510]  God, that looks sick.
[13:40.510 --> 13:41.810]  Seeing how these things play out
[13:41.810 --> 13:44.050]  after the moment is so amazing.
[13:44.270 --> 13:45.610]  Yeah, a lot of the time I'll take a clip.
[13:46.390 --> 13:46.950]  Oh, yeah.
[13:48.030 --> 13:50.650]  And sometimes I'll just take a clip if I hear something happen.
[13:51.090 --> 13:51.850]  And then I'll look at it later.
[13:53.030 --> 13:53.570]  Oh, damn.
[13:55.310 --> 13:56.030]  Wow.
[13:56.370 --> 13:57.390]  Oh, my god.
[13:58.490 --> 13:59.190]  Deep tape.
[14:00.070 --> 14:00.630]  Deep tape.
[14:02.750 --> 14:03.370]  Framing.
[14:04.110 --> 14:04.770]  Awesome boy.
[14:09.210 --> 14:09.910]  His neck.
[14:10.490 --> 14:10.810]  Yeah.
[14:12.090 --> 14:12.850]  What a throw.
[14:14.230 --> 14:14.370]  Oh.
[14:17.050 --> 14:18.170]  I have to run.
[14:22.740 --> 14:24.040]  This guy's toast.
[14:24.040 --> 14:25.680]  Oh, he's so...
[14:26.410 --> 14:27.580]  Oh, no.
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.900]  Please, sir.
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.920]  You're just doing your best
[14:42.920 --> 14:44.460]  to keep him on there.
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.740]  I think you literally saw him
[14:52.740 --> 14:54.100]  die on the back of my car there.
[14:54.360 --> 14:55.620]  Oh, man.
[14:57.800 --> 14:58.520]  Uh-oh.
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.950]  Oh, no.
[15:08.370 --> 15:08.990]  Oh, no.
[15:09.410 --> 15:10.850]  Oh, my god.
[15:12.150 --> 15:13.150]  Those are toasty.
[15:13.410 --> 15:13.630]  Cruel.
[15:19.050 --> 15:20.470]  The wrong kind of interference
[15:20.470 --> 15:21.090]  we're running here.
[15:27.300 --> 15:28.180]  Is Andrew missing
[15:28.180 --> 15:28.740]  through this bit?
[15:30.060 --> 15:31.040]  Probably.
[15:31.220 --> 15:31.560]  Probably.
[15:39.590 --> 15:41.660]  Oh, my god.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.320]  Look at his eyes.
[15:44.100 --> 15:45.180]  Holy shit.
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.520]  Oh, god.
[15:50.640 --> 15:51.960]  Oh, no.
[15:52.620 --> 15:54.260]  Getting lovely.
[15:57.250 --> 15:58.560]  Gavin, this is awesome.
[15:58.560 --> 16:00.540]  Uh-oh, that's me.
[16:01.760 --> 16:03.100]  Oh, no.
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.040]  Oh, the takedown.
[16:06.540 --> 16:07.380]  Lost my door.
[16:16.080 --> 16:17.500]  Uh-oh.
[16:28.780 --> 16:31.680]  You guys are idiots.
[16:31.680 --> 16:32.860]  Trust him.
[16:33.760 --> 16:35.280]  You guys are idiots.
[16:36.140 --> 16:37.400]  This was part of a heist?
[16:37.780 --> 16:39.540]  I think it was like between.
[16:39.860 --> 16:40.080]  Yeah.
[16:41.620 --> 16:44.260]  That was definitely like we had just wrapped one up
[16:44.260 --> 16:46.240]  and now we're dicking around until we end the video.
[16:46.520 --> 16:48.320]  Oh, my god. Those guys are brutalized.
[16:49.180 --> 16:49.740]  Oh, man.
[16:49.920 --> 16:52.000]  Yeah, this gun is absolutely brutal.
[16:52.320 --> 16:52.420]  Uh-oh.
[16:53.400 --> 16:54.980]  Oh, no, he got up to run.
[17:04.090 --> 17:05.290]  No witnesses.
[17:05.690 --> 17:06.790]  No witnesses.
[17:07.550 --> 17:11.230]  No, those guys are bad guys. It's okay.
[17:11.590 --> 17:12.050]  It's okay.
[17:15.650 --> 17:17.470]  Oh, the sound.
[17:19.210 --> 17:20.730]  Oh, the blip.
[17:22.610 --> 17:23.710]  Trevor is with us?
[17:24.090 --> 17:25.670]  Yeah, this is Andrew with Trevor.
[17:26.990 --> 17:27.590]  I don't remember that.
[17:27.790 --> 17:29.050]  I'm flying.
[17:30.710 --> 17:32.450]  Oh, no.
[17:33.030 --> 17:34.730]  That's not going well for me.
[17:36.890 --> 17:38.510]  Grinding that tape on the ground.
[17:41.750 --> 17:43.950]  Wow, right side up.
[17:44.350 --> 17:44.510]  What?
[17:45.410 --> 17:46.350]  Oh, that's right.
[17:49.750 --> 17:50.350]  Idiots.
[17:53.990 --> 17:55.330]  This is me and Andrew.
[17:57.310 --> 17:58.250]  That's Eric and Nick.
[17:58.310 --> 18:00.050]  Yeah, it looks like you're locked in.
[18:09.190 --> 18:11.090]  Trying to get out of the car.
[18:11.330 --> 18:13.370]  I don't know why I left the safety of the vehicle.
[18:17.810 --> 18:19.770]  Why did we suddenly get dressed for the beach?
[18:19.890 --> 18:20.130]  I don't know.
[18:21.450 --> 18:24.390]  This part of the heist is us trying to steal
[18:24.390 --> 18:26.590]  these specific trucks or whatever
[18:26.590 --> 18:29.550]  and it was just to look a certain part, I think.
[18:36.170 --> 18:37.370]  Oh, Andrew.
[18:38.330 --> 18:43.690]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18:44.590 --> 18:45.650]  Oh, man.
[18:46.110 --> 18:46.650]  The rat's driving.
[18:46.970 --> 18:49.710]  It would only be cooler if we were smoking cigarettes.
[18:50.410 --> 18:51.070]  Hell yeah.
[18:52.930 --> 18:53.650]  Uh-oh.
[18:55.410 --> 18:56.270]  Rolls around.
[18:58.830 --> 18:59.990]  Oh, man.
[19:01.190 --> 19:04.190]  Just got chewed up.
[19:05.410 --> 19:08.970]  Where did you get out of the car?
[19:09.450 --> 19:10.750]  Just dove out at some point.
[19:14.470 --> 19:15.050]  Wow.
[19:17.990 --> 19:19.330]  That guy didn't make it.
[19:20.030 --> 19:20.790]  Oh, yeah?
[19:21.400 --> 19:21.830]  You think?
[19:22.670 --> 19:22.970]  Oh.
[19:24.830 --> 19:25.950]  Do you remember this?
[19:26.050 --> 19:26.870]  I remember this one.
[19:31.010 --> 19:32.970]  Gavin, this video rules.
[19:33.250 --> 19:34.290]  This is so good.
[19:34.650 --> 19:35.990]  Oh, my God.
[19:36.990 --> 19:38.510]  It's like 25 minutes, though.
[19:39.160 --> 19:39.450]  Wow.
[19:40.030 --> 19:44.710]  I'm like Jaws.
[19:46.410 --> 19:48.330]  I just want to get back on my bike.
[19:49.530 --> 19:50.870]  Too bad, baby.
[19:51.510 --> 19:52.370]  Oh, shit.
[19:52.610 --> 19:54.450]  Oh, my God.
[19:55.550 --> 19:55.870]  Whoa.
[19:59.130 --> 20:00.930]  I remember that so well.
[20:01.170 --> 20:02.250]  Holy shit.
[20:02.510 --> 20:03.530]  That was crazy.
[20:06.630 --> 20:07.850]  This, I don't know why is it.
[20:07.890 --> 20:09.170]  I just maybe lost a bunch of dicks.
[20:09.730 --> 20:11.290]  Is this when we were in the boat?
[20:11.530 --> 20:13.130]  We weren't seated in the boat?
[20:15.030 --> 20:16.630]  Wait, why did you dive out?
[20:16.690 --> 20:17.510]  I don't know.
[20:18.050 --> 20:18.910]  No idea.
[20:21.470 --> 20:23.150]  This is when we were with this guy.
[20:23.330 --> 20:24.470]  This guy in the pink shirt.
[20:25.350 --> 20:25.870]  What was his name?
[20:26.130 --> 20:26.450]  Avi?
[20:28.210 --> 20:29.430]  Avi Schwartzman or something.
[20:30.290 --> 20:31.050]  Oh, God.
[20:31.090 --> 20:32.290]  I remember this all too well.
[20:36.210 --> 20:38.310]  I'm just pulling up in the minivan.
[20:38.310 --> 20:40.150]  Yeah, I mean, what could go wrong in the minivan?
[20:40.710 --> 20:41.290]  Hop in.
[20:42.470 --> 20:43.130]  Everybody get in.
[20:44.250 --> 20:44.750]  It's easy.
[20:47.510 --> 20:47.590]  Ah.
[20:54.580 --> 20:56.180]  He's unfazed.
[21:00.240 --> 21:02.480]  On the bike.
[21:02.820 --> 21:03.480]  Oh, you turned.
[21:04.740 --> 21:06.880]  Oh, his legs.
[21:11.240 --> 21:15.160]  Dude, you're right.
[21:15.220 --> 21:17.060]  How is this an Xbox 360 game?
[21:18.100 --> 21:19.620]  Insane. Absolutely insane.
[21:19.740 --> 21:20.960]  I think this feature did come later.
[21:21.580 --> 21:23.800]  Oh, yeah, but just the fact that, like...
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.360]  This is the system.
[21:25.540 --> 21:25.720]  No!
[21:30.940 --> 21:31.940]  Just gone.
[21:35.360 --> 21:36.120]  Oh, ridiculous.
[21:40.120 --> 21:43.400]  I did not see that coming.
[21:46.380 --> 21:47.180]  Oh, man.
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.820]  Eric, were you the wolfman?
[21:54.180 --> 21:55.440]  There were two wolfmen.
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.240]  And I think I might have been one of them.
[21:57.260 --> 21:57.880]  I don't remember.
[21:59.160 --> 22:00.940]  Because I think Nick was the back wolfman.
[22:01.140 --> 22:03.460]  Yeah, I might have been front wolfman.
[22:07.900 --> 22:15.050]  You are unloading.
[22:16.590 --> 22:17.810]  Oh, God.
[22:17.930 --> 22:18.370]  Oh, no.
[22:18.370 --> 22:25.290]  Did I die?
[22:25.430 --> 22:25.830]  Uh-oh.
[22:26.030 --> 22:27.450]  Oh, no.
[22:28.730 --> 22:29.650]  Rear wolf.
[22:29.850 --> 22:31.330]  Oh, my God.
[22:33.410 --> 22:34.750]  Wolfman released.
[22:35.490 --> 22:37.590]  You're free of your pain.
[22:40.130 --> 22:42.370]  Oh, this fucking mission.
[22:42.970 --> 22:45.070]  This took forever.
[22:49.250 --> 22:51.030]  Is this the part where Andrew's like,
[22:51.090 --> 22:52.270]  I'm doing this my way.
[22:52.490 --> 22:54.030]  And then that's just what this was.
[22:54.330 --> 22:56.910]  Also, look how many people we rip out of vehicles here.
[22:58.050 --> 22:59.330]  We're just like constantly
[22:59.330 --> 23:00.450]  dumping people.
[23:00.610 --> 23:02.830]  Going around and pulling people out.
[23:06.370 --> 23:07.370]  Oh, shit.
[23:08.450 --> 23:11.090]  Oh, that's right. We get on this thing, right?
[23:11.150 --> 23:11.670]  More body.
[23:12.510 --> 23:13.470]  Another one?
[23:14.030 --> 23:14.510]  Jesus.
[23:18.530 --> 23:19.950]  I thought you were just unloading.
[23:20.930 --> 23:21.550]  Jesus.
[23:22.070 --> 23:22.510]  No.
[23:25.630 --> 23:26.250]  Sail.
[23:36.170 --> 23:38.550]  I just placed this angle as if it was
[23:38.550 --> 23:39.610]  like a security camera.
[23:40.110 --> 23:40.730]  I love it.
[23:42.310 --> 23:43.230]  Oh, yeah.
[23:43.230 --> 23:43.850]  Oh, yeah.
[23:50.850 --> 23:53.790]  Everybody inside of the compound's like, what the fuck?
[23:54.110 --> 23:55.170]  What happened out there?
[23:57.550 --> 23:57.910]  Damn.
[24:00.450 --> 24:01.430]  That's cool.
[24:03.490 --> 24:05.350]  Just mow them down.
[24:05.990 --> 24:06.790]  Hell, yeah.
[24:06.990 --> 24:08.670]  Bouncing off the couch.
[24:09.200 --> 24:09.430]  99.
[24:10.810 --> 24:12.490]  Oh, this mission.
[24:13.090 --> 24:14.810]  Getting towards the end. We got the bags of money.
[24:15.050 --> 24:16.650]  This is the one that took forever.
[24:17.130 --> 24:17.210]  Yep.
[24:21.160 --> 24:22.360]  Oh, that's so cool.
[24:24.600 --> 24:26.700]  Like, this wasn't your tent, Gavin,
[24:26.780 --> 24:28.820]  but if you wanted to submit a very public
[24:28.820 --> 24:31.140]  application to make a GTA 6 trailer,
[24:31.220 --> 24:31.900]  yeah, no kidding.
[24:32.300 --> 24:33.280]  This is incredible.
[24:33.480 --> 24:36.680]  My one request for GTA 6 would be let me move
[24:36.680 --> 24:37.980]  the camera further away from me.
[24:37.980 --> 24:39.700]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:39.780 --> 24:42.480]  This is Eric suddenly realizing that Gavin
[24:42.480 --> 24:43.500]  has continued running.
[24:44.240 --> 24:45.240]  Yeah, I just kept going.
[24:51.960 --> 24:53.540]  God, so sick.
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.080]  Oh, it's this part.
[24:59.580 --> 24:59.840]  Great.
[25:02.200 --> 25:03.260]  Don't worry, guys.
[25:03.300 --> 25:04.140]  I got you covered.
[25:06.200 --> 25:07.300]  Look how in sick we were,
[25:07.480 --> 25:07.700]  hey, Nick.
[25:12.000 --> 25:13.820]  Oh, that's awesome.
[25:14.140 --> 25:15.080]  This is going off.
[25:15.680 --> 25:16.560]  Hey, Eric, we're helping.
[25:17.120 --> 25:18.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:23.250 --> 25:25.110]  What could possibly go wrong?
[25:25.130 --> 25:26.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:26.410 --> 25:28.090]  Check out all the help.
[25:28.650 --> 25:29.670]  Check out all the help.
[25:31.390 --> 25:32.510]  That's some bullshit.
[25:34.930 --> 25:42.550]  Oh, god.
[25:44.170 --> 25:46.510]  If I never see this part again, man.
[25:48.450 --> 25:50.910]  I'm excited to see how that edit turns out.
[25:53.850 --> 25:54.990]  What a team.
[25:55.170 --> 25:55.790]  That's awesome.
[25:56.590 --> 25:57.750]  What a team.
[25:58.410 --> 26:00.410]  And I'm already smacking into all the walls.
[26:01.910 --> 26:02.490]  What a team.
[26:02.490 --> 26:03.810]  I went the wrong way out the gate.
[26:04.150 --> 26:04.390]  Yep.
[26:04.830 --> 26:06.630]  Yeah, big time.
[26:08.950 --> 26:10.570]  But now we're going the right way.
[26:11.190 --> 26:12.390]  Oh, you got it.
[26:17.610 --> 26:20.170]  I hate this mission so much.
[26:23.390 --> 26:25.050]  Our cut could have been so big.
[26:28.910 --> 26:31.370]  I could just hear Eric on the back of that berating you.
[26:32.490 --> 26:32.550]  Yeah.
[26:34.890 --> 26:36.790]  Just screaming in silence while deafened.
[26:37.050 --> 26:37.410]  Yep.
[26:38.910 --> 26:40.030]  Oh, nice move.
[26:44.850 --> 26:45.990]  What shot?
[26:46.290 --> 26:46.530]  Wow.
[26:47.570 --> 26:47.970]  Shoot.
[26:51.030 --> 26:51.950]  Oh, no.
[26:54.230 --> 26:59.030]  Yeah, we tried with this at one point.
[27:01.270 --> 27:03.070]  It also didn't work out too well.
[27:07.220 --> 27:08.140]  Oh, God.
[27:10.140 --> 27:11.120]  Oh, Jesus.
[27:12.820 --> 27:13.420]  Wow.
[27:15.160 --> 27:15.760]  Whoa.
[27:17.460 --> 27:18.660]  Oh, man.
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.040]  That was awesome.
[27:25.200 --> 27:27.420]  This is so fucking cool, Gavin.
[27:27.640 --> 27:28.060]  Yeah, this rocks.
[27:28.480 --> 27:29.020]  Oh, thanks.
[27:30.040 --> 27:32.800]  Oh, that guy under the wheel just got...
[27:34.880 --> 27:36.720]  Oh, and then he blew up again.
[27:38.660 --> 27:39.700]  Oh, my God.
[27:39.800 --> 27:40.740]  He keeps dying.
[27:41.780 --> 27:42.400]  Uh-oh.
[27:45.440 --> 27:47.820]  That guy doesn't want anything to do with this.
[27:48.580 --> 27:49.820]  Oh, no.
[27:50.200 --> 27:50.680]  Oh, no.
[27:51.380 --> 27:52.220]  Oh, no.
[27:55.260 --> 27:56.360]  We're having fun.
[27:57.400 --> 27:59.380]  Me and my friends having fun.
[27:59.560 --> 28:00.600]  Yeah, the rat's like, do you hear something?
[28:00.600 --> 28:01.060]  I don't know.
[28:02.640 --> 28:04.120]  Okay, so that's everything for the heist.
[28:04.320 --> 28:05.640]  Do you want to see a...
[28:06.980 --> 28:07.980]  Here's the thing with this one.
[28:08.320 --> 28:09.780]  I don't think this is from Doomsday Heist.
[28:09.880 --> 28:12.840]  I think this is when we tried to do the other heist and just did a bunch of different shit.
[28:12.860 --> 28:13.340]  Oh, yeah.
[28:13.940 --> 28:16.600]  But I assume that will come out next and then Doomsday, right?
[28:16.700 --> 28:17.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[28:18.040 --> 28:20.940]  Okay, so here's an upcoming moment.
[28:21.300 --> 28:21.460]  Okay.
[28:22.520 --> 28:23.200]  Oh, the mini heist.
[28:27.500 --> 28:28.100]  Oh, God.
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.520]  Who's flying?
[28:33.120 --> 28:33.380]  Me.
[28:33.800 --> 28:35.520]  Yeah, I was going to say probably Gavin.
[28:40.740 --> 28:41.400]  Full squad, though.
[28:42.160 --> 28:42.500]  Oh, yeah.
[28:52.640 --> 28:55.340]  Nick's just shooing through the windshield.
[28:59.140 --> 29:01.980]  Well, that's much more powerful.
[29:02.140 --> 29:03.380]  Oh, my God.
[29:03.380 --> 29:05.240]  Oh, shit.
[29:08.380 --> 29:09.660]  Armor in my ass.
[29:10.100 --> 29:10.740]  Wow.
[29:11.640 --> 29:12.480]  Oh, no.
[29:12.980 --> 29:15.400]  Wow, Gavin, this is crazy.
[29:17.660 --> 29:19.340]  This feels more like Halo, Jesus.
[29:20.060 --> 29:20.700]  Wow.
[29:22.640 --> 29:24.880]  This is us being cool and then
[29:25.720 --> 29:27.220]  suddenly not being cool.
[29:27.660 --> 29:28.560]  He's so brave.
[29:29.240 --> 29:32.380]  This is not what it feels like to play this video game.
[29:32.380 --> 29:32.660]  Oh, no.
[29:34.600 --> 29:35.640]  Oh, man.
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.180]  Oh, my God, look at all the bullet casings.
[29:38.480 --> 29:38.980]  Wow.
[29:40.080 --> 29:41.120]  Oh, shit.
[29:41.880 --> 29:42.440]  Oh, no.
[29:52.340 --> 29:53.980]  Rats can't swim, Eric.
[29:56.080 --> 29:57.920]  It's like Gavin hit the eject button.
[29:59.220 --> 30:00.020]  And there we go.
[30:00.640 --> 30:00.860]  Wow.
[30:02.240 --> 30:03.800]  Gavin, that was incredible.
[30:04.220 --> 30:05.320]  That was so good.
[30:05.720 --> 30:07.380]  Didn't we look cool some of the time?
[30:07.480 --> 30:09.900]  We did. That rocked.
[30:09.940 --> 30:10.320]  Wow.

[30:24.460 --> 30:26.960]  Can't wait. Let's do it.
[30:26.960 --> 30:28.200]  All right, we'll see you guys next time.
[30:28.540 --> 30:28.780]  Bye!
