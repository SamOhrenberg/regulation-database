[00:00.000 --> 00:02.740]  I don't care what Eric said, he's not here.
[00:02.840 --> 00:05.000]  He can't tell us not to go live to me.
[00:05.000 --> 00:06.380]  Oh, are we live two minutes? All right.
[00:07.360 --> 00:08.400]  Yeah, we're live two minutes early.
[00:09.220 --> 00:09.980]  What should we do for two minutes?
[00:10.180 --> 00:11.920]  Talk about Eric.
[00:12.420 --> 00:13.200]  Yeah, talk about Eric.
[00:13.240 --> 00:14.300]  Now, let's play the game.
[00:15.380 --> 00:16.240]  Oh, you want to get...
[00:16.240 --> 00:17.700]  You want to go straight into it?
[00:17.780 --> 00:20.640]  I wanted to start early because once you set this game up,
[00:20.700 --> 00:22.900]  a couple of things are going to happen if you wait too long.
[00:23.000 --> 00:24.300]  People are going to start getting kicked
[00:24.760 --> 00:26.740]  or the game is going to start on its own anyway.
[00:27.060 --> 00:29.360]  So I figured we might as well be rolling and live.
[00:29.920 --> 00:33.500]  Yeah, I feel like we lost a lot of lobbies to one of us
[00:33.500 --> 00:34.860]  taking a piss in the past.
[00:35.280 --> 00:35.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.340]  And it's hard to get a lobby back once you lose it to piss.
[00:39.660 --> 00:42.160]  Who was the most guilty of piss droppage?
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.140]  Michael Jones.
[00:43.580 --> 00:43.940]  Michael Jones.
[00:46.020 --> 00:47.060]  That's not even a contest.
[00:47.760 --> 00:48.500]  You know what? That's fair.
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.500]  He pissed enough for for all for all of us together.
[00:55.300 --> 00:57.160]  Yeah, I don't know what any of these cars are.
[00:59.280 --> 01:01.760]  A lot of the time I would piggyback on his pisses.
[01:02.320 --> 01:06.540]  Oh, yeah. His piss was a great window to A, bitch, and then B, piss yourself.
[01:07.840 --> 01:09.220]  Well, piss, comma.
[01:10.420 --> 01:11.440]  But hey, yeah.
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.100]  If it weren't for hypocrisy, we'd have no ocracy.
[01:17.400 --> 01:21.740]  All right, so everyone, we're watching Nick's perspective.
[01:22.540 --> 01:25.880]  Yes. And Geoff, you can imagine, is flapping his arms.
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.080]  You know, you know what I'm doing.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.820]  I'm recording it, though, for future use.
[01:30.260 --> 01:30.940]  Oh, yeah.
[01:32.780 --> 01:33.980]  I got news for you guys.
[01:34.160 --> 01:37.460]  I don't oh, I don't do that for the video or the audio.
[01:37.680 --> 01:39.000]  I do that when I play GTA.
[01:39.340 --> 01:40.660]  I do that when I'm by myself.
[01:41.520 --> 01:44.460]  That's what I do to see other people.
[01:44.780 --> 01:45.300]  Not yet.
[01:45.600 --> 01:47.600]  Oh, OK. Hey, floppy disk repair, man.
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.900]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[01:49.340 --> 01:50.320]  Thank you so much.
[01:50.340 --> 01:51.120]  Floppy disk repair, man.
[01:51.120 --> 01:52.700]  And I loved the video you made recently.
[01:52.700 --> 01:53.780]  It was a it was a banger.
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.720]  I feel like my view is...
[01:56.720 --> 02:00.340]  Oh, so we just fight in here?
[02:00.520 --> 02:01.940]  No, you just get into the safe zone, man.
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.040]  OK, yeah, we're playing this because Geoff remembered it existed in a recent episode.
[02:06.580 --> 02:07.140]  It was fun.
[02:07.600 --> 02:08.380]  Yeah, I'll zoom out.
[02:09.520 --> 02:11.500]  How do I change my camera view?
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.500]  That when you get killed, Nick, for being rubbish, you film the rest of us.
[02:15.940 --> 02:17.220]  Absolutely. How do you flip cams?
[02:19.000 --> 02:19.880]  Once you're dead, do you know?
[02:20.600 --> 02:22.640]  D-pad or something.
[02:22.640 --> 02:23.900]  You'll figure it out.
[02:24.480 --> 02:25.320]  You're a smart guy.
[02:26.080 --> 02:26.480]  Yeah.
[02:28.440 --> 02:30.000]  Oh, I didn't even realize the thing moved.
[02:30.080 --> 02:31.380]  Are you guys not coming to the safe zone?
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.440]  Well, you don't you don't always want to be early.
[02:35.940 --> 02:39.020]  Sometimes you want to be fashionably late and bunt someone right off.
[02:39.720 --> 02:42.180]  Oh, early being early means you're a sitting duck.
[02:43.960 --> 02:45.160]  Get him, Andrew! No!
[02:47.260 --> 02:48.480]  OK, that was close.
[02:49.100 --> 02:51.120]  Oh, Andrew left the chat.
[02:52.020 --> 02:52.900]  Oh, great.
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.160]  Yeah, I didn't realize that Andrew hasn't said anything yet.
[02:56.700 --> 02:59.400]  Oh, did he leave the game, too, or is he still here?
[03:00.900 --> 03:02.060]  Oh, he's driving.
[03:03.340 --> 03:05.500]  Maybe he's so upset he had to leave.
[03:05.740 --> 03:07.260]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[03:07.900 --> 03:10.240]  Is he in the...
[03:10.240 --> 03:11.000]  Yeah, he's in the game.
[03:11.340 --> 03:12.400]  How are you going to kill me, though?
[03:13.140 --> 03:14.940]  Andrew Penn is in the game.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.700]  Well, maybe we'll be putting out a secondary version of this
[03:21.700 --> 03:23.160]  with the Andrew cut where he's talking.
[03:23.340 --> 03:25.620]  Yeah. Oh, do we have to jump this?
[03:28.040 --> 03:29.340]  Oh, what a front flip.
[03:29.920 --> 03:31.600]  Yeah, my back flew off.
[03:31.920 --> 03:32.620]  Pretty stylish.
[03:33.920 --> 03:35.040]  It was pretty stylish.
[03:35.240 --> 03:38.540]  It wasn't entirely for that purpose, though.
[03:40.860 --> 03:43.560]  Jockey Billfish with the five kifta sauce.
[03:44.300 --> 03:47.520]  Gavin's over here getting subs from his Worms characters.
[03:47.700 --> 03:50.780]  Gavin, add that to a Worms nameless tier.
[03:51.740 --> 03:51.960]  Say what?
[03:52.480 --> 03:53.020]  What?
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.380]  Yeah, that was a free worm name.
[03:58.500 --> 04:01.940]  Oh, dude, Jeremy Dooley with the 20.
[04:02.520 --> 04:05.720]  20. Jeremy. Jeremy Dooley.
[04:05.720 --> 04:06.360]  Thank you.
[04:08.500 --> 04:10.720]  Let's play more games soon, Jerebold.
[04:10.980 --> 04:11.660]  Yeah, let's play.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.280]  Jeremy, get your little ass in the
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.560]  GTA with us.
[04:14.560 --> 04:15.420]  Yeah, dude.
[04:15.420 --> 04:17.480]  Get your medium ass in GTA with us.
[04:17.800 --> 04:18.560]  Oh, Andrew's out.
[04:18.980 --> 04:19.620]  Oh, dear.
[04:19.800 --> 04:20.700]  Oh, no.
[04:21.420 --> 04:22.640]  Imagine if Jeremy just...
[04:22.640 --> 04:22.820]  Oh!
[04:24.660 --> 04:25.580]  Gavin's out.
[04:34.120 --> 04:34.800]  Suck!
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.640]  Oh, Christ.
[04:55.440 --> 04:56.620]  God damn it.
[04:56.940 --> 04:57.960]  And where's Andrew at?
[04:58.480 --> 05:00.000]  Where is Andrew?
[05:00.360 --> 05:01.980]  Where is he?
[05:03.280 --> 05:06.000]  Hey, a 3 tick game up with 20 kifta 7.
[05:06.180 --> 05:08.260]  People dropping 20s like it's...
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.080]  Dropping 20s.
[05:09.580 --> 05:10.300]  Like it's the 20th.
[05:10.580 --> 05:11.600]  Is today 20 day?
[05:13.120 --> 05:14.160]  It's probably 20 day.
[05:14.160 --> 05:15.040]  Jeremy started a revolution.
[05:16.240 --> 05:17.020]  Thank you, Jeremy.
[05:17.040 --> 05:18.100]  Oh, wait, we got a slack.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.740]  Is that Andrew?
[05:20.120 --> 05:20.820]  Oh, we got a slack?
[05:21.120 --> 05:22.040]  Hold on.
[05:22.140 --> 05:23.480]  My wife slacked me in the other one.
[05:23.780 --> 05:26.080]  Did you slack with your wife?
[05:26.740 --> 05:27.220]  Oh, yeah.
[05:27.860 --> 05:28.760]  I don't know, I lost the slack.
[05:29.080 --> 05:30.900]  Special agent male stripper for 5 gifted subs.
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.060]  Thanks a lot.
[05:32.180 --> 05:33.560]  I almost didn't drive to the thing.
[05:34.100 --> 05:34.320]  Same.
[05:34.660 --> 05:37.160]  I was looking at my phone trying to figure out where Andrew is.
[05:38.380 --> 05:38.960]  There he is.
[05:39.040 --> 05:39.340]  Andrew!
[05:39.580 --> 05:39.880]  I'm back!
[05:40.520 --> 05:41.700]  Oh, my shit locked up.
[05:41.900 --> 05:42.340]  But I'm back.
[05:42.700 --> 05:43.220]  Sorry about that.
[05:43.540 --> 05:44.980]  Hey, welcome to the stream.
[05:45.700 --> 05:46.320]  Thank you.
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.060]  I'm raving in.
[05:48.440 --> 05:50.120]  So we just got to try to stay in the circle.
[05:50.280 --> 05:51.680]  What's the exact goal here?
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.620]  Be the last one alive.
[05:53.800 --> 05:54.180]  Be the last?
[05:54.220 --> 05:54.520]  Okay.
[05:55.120 --> 05:56.720]  The circles get smaller each round.
[05:57.000 --> 05:57.400]  Oh, no.
[05:58.640 --> 06:02.460]  And sometimes you'll die on the way to the next circle like we did last time.
[06:02.740 --> 06:03.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[06:03.900 --> 06:05.940]  Sometimes you'll get bunced and sometimes you'll bunce yourself.
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.620]  Oh, shit, Nick.
[06:07.060 --> 06:10.180]  Monolith9x with 5 gifted subs and Centaur Smeg.
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.360]  A centaur smeg?
[06:13.780 --> 06:14.840]  A little bit of centaur smeg.
[06:14.840 --> 06:15.980]  Worms name for Gavin.
[06:16.240 --> 06:16.960]  No, yeah.
[06:18.040 --> 06:20.160]  I'm getting worms names out of the anus.
[06:21.300 --> 06:25.420]  We should do a Falcon event where we let the Falcons name all of our worms.
[06:25.660 --> 06:26.020]  Yes!
[06:26.040 --> 06:26.640]  Oh, that's great.
[06:26.820 --> 06:29.420]  Like when you place your worms, but everyone's naming our worms.
[06:31.320 --> 06:33.980]  I've been keeping a list of worms names.
[06:34.400 --> 06:34.720]  Ooh.
[06:35.840 --> 06:40.060]  Because I realize sometimes I get there last second and I come up with um names and things of that nature.
[06:40.220 --> 06:42.240]  I definitely phone it in.
[06:44.160 --> 06:45.800]  I just promote Geoff's movies.
[06:45.940 --> 06:47.380]  That's been my strategy recently.
[06:47.580 --> 06:48.900]  Hey, man, I appreciate it.
[06:49.980 --> 06:53.600]  Oh, everybody go see clown in a Kornfeld this weekend playing at the Alamo Draft House.
[06:53.760 --> 06:54.160]  Kornfeld?
[06:55.340 --> 06:56.840]  No, that's uh, you're thinking of Seinfeld.
[06:59.900 --> 07:01.420]  You pile of waste!
[07:01.780 --> 07:03.900]  I caught that! I caught that in the green!
[07:04.100 --> 07:04.900]  Ah, shit!
[07:07.560 --> 07:10.420]  To the kazoo.
[07:11.580 --> 07:12.860]  To the kazoo?
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.660]  10 gifted subs, thank you very much.
[07:14.660 --> 07:15.140]  Thank you so much.
[07:17.300 --> 07:19.540]  How are you able to keep an eye on both things?
[07:19.680 --> 07:21.340]  I feel like all my attention is on...
[07:21.340 --> 07:22.300]  He's dead, dude.
[07:23.180 --> 07:24.020]  Oh, you know what? Fair point.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.940]  You were trying to hit someone to be fair.
[07:27.120 --> 07:27.680]  Yeah, that's true.
[07:28.140 --> 07:30.000]  I'm doing glances, little micro-glances.
[07:31.360 --> 07:32.040]  He's a micro.
[07:32.340 --> 07:33.920]  He's long been a micro-glancer.
[07:34.520 --> 07:34.600]  Yeah.
[07:36.980 --> 07:38.020]  He does micro...
[07:38.020 --> 07:38.980]  Nick went flying.
[07:38.980 --> 07:41.400]  He does micro-glance dosing.
[07:41.420 --> 07:42.260]  Ah! Ah!
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.320]  Oh, massive bunce there.
[07:45.740 --> 07:46.740]  No one's in the circle.
[07:49.360 --> 07:50.080]  Oh no.
[07:50.320 --> 07:51.140]  Everyone's in the circle.
[07:51.260 --> 07:51.840]  Ow! Ow! Ow!
[07:53.300 --> 07:54.320]  Alright, where's next?
[07:55.620 --> 07:56.560]  I'm taking a gamble.
[07:56.980 --> 07:58.560]  Straight that way. Nope. Nope. Wait. Wait. Okay.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.740]  Oh, it's all the way on the other side!
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.380]  Our office tour video is now on YouTube.
[08:03.660 --> 08:05.140]  It's a segment of the stream that we cut out.
[08:05.160 --> 08:05.520]  No!
[08:05.520 --> 08:05.900]  No!
[08:08.020 --> 08:10.540]  Yes to the YouTube, but no to me dying!
[08:11.400 --> 08:12.880]  You want to know what the office looks like,
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.020]  you can check that out on our
[08:14.020 --> 08:15.140]  Patreon or our YouTube
[08:15.680 --> 08:17.440]  podcast channel, not YouTube
[08:17.440 --> 08:19.540]  gaming channel, because we have two different ones.
[08:19.640 --> 08:20.220]  It's not confusing.
[08:21.820 --> 08:22.440]  Yeah, not at all.
[08:25.520 --> 08:27.140]  Andrew made his debut as a little
[08:27.140 --> 08:29.140]  robot. His robot debut.
[08:29.340 --> 08:30.040]  He's zipping around. A robot!
[08:31.120 --> 08:32.880]  Kylo Apologist, thanks for the five.
[08:32.880 --> 08:34.020]  Thank you so much.
[08:34.960 --> 08:37.240]  What kind of Apologist? He's like Robin Williams in that movie.
[08:37.680 --> 08:38.960]  I assume a Kylo Ren
[08:38.960 --> 08:40.580]  Apologist. Jesus
[08:40.580 --> 08:42.480]  ass! Sippers...
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.260]  I could never say it.
[08:44.780 --> 08:45.960]  Sippers and
[08:47.000 --> 08:47.840]  an instrument.
[08:48.920 --> 08:50.640]  With 25 gifted subs!
[08:50.840 --> 08:51.820]  Holy shit! Thank you very much!
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.240]  Where's the other one?
[08:55.120 --> 08:56.980]  Oh no! No, let's not do that.
[08:57.100 --> 08:57.560]  Let's not...
[08:59.260 --> 09:00.800]  Another Nick victory.
[09:00.800 --> 09:01.480]  Yes!
[09:01.820 --> 09:03.520]  A Nick-tory, if you will.
[09:03.840 --> 09:05.100]  We must take him out.
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.240]  You won't be able to.
[09:07.280 --> 09:09.800]  He's in the mom van. What are you going to do? He's bullying us.
[09:10.280 --> 09:12.240]  Oh, you know what? I'll tell you what. I didn't know what I was picking.
[09:12.420 --> 09:13.600]  No, that's fine. You go right ahead.
[09:14.360 --> 09:15.580]  That's what we're going to do to you later.
[09:16.400 --> 09:16.760]  What?
[09:17.620 --> 09:18.820]  I was about to say, you got faked.
[09:21.920 --> 09:23.900]  Oh my, Morg's back with another 10.
[09:24.120 --> 09:25.280]  A weekly 10 drop.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.480]  Alright, so what do we do now?
[09:29.960 --> 09:30.480]  Now
[09:30.480 --> 09:31.880]  it's going to offer us
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.720]  some similar
[09:34.620 --> 09:36.580]  game types, hopefully, or some similar jobs
[09:36.580 --> 09:38.500]  and hopefully we'll be able to pick one of the other
[09:38.500 --> 09:40.400]  7 sumos. Yeah, there we go.
[09:40.720 --> 09:41.520]  Let's just do sumo 2.
[09:42.580 --> 09:44.640]  Sumo 2, Samuel
[09:45.520 --> 09:46.040]  O'Stache
[09:46.040 --> 09:47.520]  with 550 subs.
[09:47.860 --> 09:50.280]  When are we getting
[09:50.280 --> 09:52.000]  more Sloppy Joe's bingo?
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.740]  It's been 6 months for non-Falcons.
[09:55.200 --> 09:56.200]  That's a great question
[09:56.200 --> 09:57.800]  and a great point. How about soon?
[09:57.960 --> 09:59.940]  Can we schedule that soon? We are behind
[09:59.940 --> 10:01.300]  on Sloppy Joe's bingo.
[10:01.400 --> 10:03.900]  If you're interested in a public
[10:03.900 --> 10:04.800]  Sloppy Joe's.
[10:05.980 --> 10:07.940]  Team balancing, number of teams 4.
[10:08.120 --> 10:09.240]  First to win 2 rounds.
[10:09.840 --> 10:11.720]  Off-road vehicles. Yeah, that's good.
[10:12.180 --> 10:13.840]  That's a Slop play to piss.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.020]  Yeah, you don't need me boosting.
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.360]  I was looking at the emote stats.
[10:17.800 --> 10:19.320]  Piss rats killing the corn cats.
[10:19.920 --> 10:20.540]  Of course.
[10:22.900 --> 10:24.600]  I've not seen a lot of corn cats today.
[10:25.100 --> 10:26.820]  Thanks for the reminder, audience.
[10:26.980 --> 10:29.060]  We will get on that Sloppy Joe's.
[10:29.140 --> 10:30.440]  The problem is Eric hates it. He doesn't
[10:30.440 --> 10:31.380]  ever want to do anything fun.
[10:32.420 --> 10:34.400]  He's like, no, I'm not even going to show up today
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.080]  for the stream.
[10:35.700 --> 10:37.160]  He's like, I'd rather eat it than watch it.
[10:37.800 --> 10:39.120]  Yeah, he's like, I'm going to eat lunch.
[10:40.180 --> 10:42.660]  To be fair to him, the last time I saw Eric, he was in rough shape.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.000]  Eric?
[10:44.580 --> 10:44.940]  Yeah.
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.680]  How are you feeling, Geoff? I'm not great.
[10:49.260 --> 10:49.620]  Really?
[10:50.380 --> 10:51.540]  That's so funny.
[10:52.060 --> 10:53.680]  We did a little
[10:55.700 --> 10:56.740]  supplemental recording
[10:56.740 --> 10:57.900]  in the new office today.
[10:58.040 --> 10:59.700]  Everybody was there, including AndrewBot.
[11:00.300 --> 11:01.280]  And I think it was
[11:01.940 --> 11:02.980]  wildly successful.
[11:03.440 --> 11:05.120]  We did Gumpler.
[11:06.360 --> 11:07.400]  We did...
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.240]  Gavin Ready.
[11:08.760 --> 11:10.760]  Oh, shit. Sorry, son.
[11:12.180 --> 11:13.020]  What else did we do?
[11:13.180 --> 11:14.320]  We spaghetti'd a sandwich.
[11:15.720 --> 11:17.880]  And we had a donut off
[11:17.880 --> 11:18.880]  that wasn't a donut off.
[11:18.880 --> 11:20.600]  It was just two dudes appreciating donuts
[11:20.600 --> 11:21.600]  until they didn't anymore.
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.100]  It was a lot of enjoyment, and then a sudden...
[11:25.100 --> 11:26.400]  dropping logs,
[11:26.600 --> 11:27.700]  scranking hogs.
[11:31.260 --> 11:32.900]  We fell off the donut
[11:32.900 --> 11:33.940]  cliff pretty hard.
[11:34.360 --> 11:36.060]  And we can confirm that
[11:36.060 --> 11:38.600]  we do have some AndrewPOV footage
[11:38.600 --> 11:40.800]  to multicam
[11:40.800 --> 11:42.320]  into the video. Oh, it's awesome.
[11:43.540 --> 11:44.800]  It felt like a whole video.
[11:45.320 --> 11:46.740]  It was really great.
[11:47.740 --> 11:48.920]  Continues to amaze.
[11:49.620 --> 11:50.660]  Like a ring doorbell
[11:50.660 --> 11:51.120]  on wheels.
[11:51.980 --> 11:54.480]  There was a moment when Andrew drove through
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.660]  something I definitely didn't want him to,
[11:56.780 --> 11:58.640]  and I was terrified that it would be
[11:58.640 --> 11:59.300]  the end of Andrew.
[12:01.460 --> 12:02.760]  Today, I was
[12:02.760 --> 12:04.600]  imagining how long Andrew's
[12:04.600 --> 12:05.480]  body will last.
[12:06.580 --> 12:08.440]  Yeah, I need to... I just
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.000]  assume that thing isn't expensive.
[12:11.140 --> 12:11.780]  Nah, it was like
[12:12.500 --> 12:14.420]  $100, or like $80 or something.
[12:14.420 --> 12:15.620]  It's pretty cheap for what it is.
[12:15.680 --> 12:18.420]  Let's try and make it last at least a month.
[12:20.880 --> 12:22.320]  Let's try to make Andrew
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.760]  last at least a month.
[12:24.300 --> 12:25.600]  More than two content days.
[12:28.180 --> 12:30.280]  I gotta say though, it is so much fun
[12:30.280 --> 12:32.020]  fucking around with that robot and filming.
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.100]  When I got in this morning,
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.260]  Nick came in right behind me, and we were
[12:36.260 --> 12:38.220]  hanging out, just talking. And then
[12:38.220 --> 12:40.540]  just very quietly, Andrew rolled by us
[12:40.540 --> 12:41.920]  and we were like, oh hey, what's up buddy?
[12:41.920 --> 12:43.380]  And then he howled at us.
[12:43.540 --> 12:45.760]  And then at some point, he hid. I'm not gonna spoil
[12:45.760 --> 12:47.760]  his hiding spot, because it's pretty good. But he went
[12:47.760 --> 12:49.880]  and hid, and I found him, and he was just hanging out
[12:49.880 --> 12:51.520]  waiting to scare people. It was great.
[12:53.360 --> 12:53.900]  I assume
[12:53.900 --> 12:55.800]  you were waiting to scare people. I sure was. I was
[12:55.800 --> 12:57.860]  real mad I had to go do something else, so I had to
[12:57.860 --> 12:59.840]  leave the screen, and then by the time I came
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.080]  back, Gavin was already in the room.
[13:04.340 --> 13:05.940]  Austin powers my...
[13:18.240 --> 13:19.040]  Triggers, Nick.
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.300]  Push him! Push him! Push him!
[13:22.820 --> 13:23.980]  Oh, don't push me!
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.280]  Hey, don't push me!
[13:25.560 --> 13:26.080]  This is...
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.360]  Eat shit!
[13:30.620 --> 13:31.240]  Oh, we lived!
[13:31.580 --> 13:32.940]  We lived! We lived!
[13:33.120 --> 13:34.660]  We lived! We lived!
[13:35.040 --> 13:36.660]  We lived! We lived!
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.760]  Oh! Oh! Oh!
[13:39.880 --> 13:41.600]  Blizzy Joy, thanks for the five
[13:41.600 --> 13:43.520]  gifted subs. Thank you so much. You guys are a long
[13:43.520 --> 13:44.700]  way from that dome.
[13:45.860 --> 13:46.700]  You got some time.
[13:47.400 --> 13:48.820]  Thanks, FrostDragon. Thanks,
[13:49.920 --> 13:50.400]  YouDunit.
[13:51.300 --> 13:52.500]  Thanks, T-Punky.
[13:54.120 --> 13:55.080]  Ah! Badoo!
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.560]  Hold the line! Hold the line! Did we figure
[13:57.560 --> 13:59.480]  out a way to record stream Andrew's POV?
[13:59.560 --> 14:01.640]  We've definitely figured out a way to record it. We have full
[14:01.640 --> 14:03.440]  footage, Gavin was just saying, from everything
[14:03.440 --> 14:04.960]  we filmed today. Yeah.
[14:06.360 --> 14:07.520]  It's not very powerful
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.420]  though, because a 30 minute video was
[14:09.420 --> 14:11.200]  uploaded to Slack. In about
[14:11.200 --> 14:11.660]  three seconds.
[14:13.280 --> 14:15.320]  I think all the files are under a gig.
[14:16.340 --> 14:17.220]  Yeah, it seems that way.
[14:17.320 --> 14:19.260]  It's probably still a higher quality than the first
[14:19.260 --> 14:20.460]  four seasons of Red vs. Blue.
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.320]  Ah! Uh-oh.
[14:23.360 --> 14:24.960]  Oh shit, this is so small!
[14:25.740 --> 14:26.240]  Uh-oh.
[14:27.140 --> 14:29.100]  Here comes Gavin! Oh! No!
[14:29.480 --> 14:30.500]  No! No!
[14:30.500 --> 14:30.880]  No!
[14:32.860 --> 14:35.400]  Nah, I haven't recorded any farts in a while, but thanks for asking.
[14:36.260 --> 14:36.660]  Ah!
[14:40.060 --> 14:40.600]  Gavin!
[14:40.940 --> 14:42.420]  Yes? What's the best way?
[14:43.420 --> 14:44.880]  Uh, the hard right.
[14:45.380 --> 14:45.920]  Got it!
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.480]  Why do they listen to that?
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.700]  Oh! Oh!
[14:50.800 --> 14:52.360]  Flip! Oh no!
[14:52.800 --> 14:54.540]  Flip back! Flip back, fool!
[14:54.800 --> 14:56.280]  Flip, flip, flip! Goodbye!
[14:57.580 --> 14:58.840]  When is the next
[14:58.840 --> 15:00.660]  fart? Can you imagine if you could
[15:00.660 --> 15:01.860]  schedule your farts?
[15:03.220 --> 15:04.240]  Oh shit! Shit!
[15:04.960 --> 15:06.120]  I mean, that would be a lot more
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.200]  convenient. I wouldn't have to live in fear sometimes.
[15:08.460 --> 15:09.760]  That is a cool car you have, Nick.
[15:10.220 --> 15:11.620]  Well, thank you. I don't know what it is.
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.020]  I just read a name and picked it.
[15:14.220 --> 15:15.320]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen it before.
[15:15.840 --> 15:16.440]  Woo, it's tiny.
[15:18.460 --> 15:20.200]  What am I doing? Driving off the edge
[15:20.200 --> 15:22.620]  pretty close, it seems like. Yeah.
[15:22.920 --> 15:24.780]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[15:24.780 --> 15:26.220]  ha ha ha ha
[15:26.220 --> 15:26.540]  ha ha!
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.200]  Oh! Goodbye!
[15:29.740 --> 15:30.080]  Oh!
[15:30.080 --> 15:30.260]  Oh!
[15:32.620 --> 15:33.800]  He keeps winning!
[15:34.860 --> 15:35.260]  Killable!
[15:35.820 --> 15:36.980]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[15:39.340 --> 15:40.120]  You'll never
[15:40.120 --> 15:41.760]  see another person's perspective, Gavin.
[15:42.320 --> 15:43.760]  Well, obviously we've got to keep you alive because
[15:43.760 --> 15:45.760]  you're streaming, so that's why we're not taking you out.
[15:46.300 --> 15:47.960]  Well, good thing I zoomed out and keep
[15:47.960 --> 15:50.020]  turning around to look. This is a little series with it called
[15:50.020 --> 15:52.160]  Nick Wins. Oh, I love
[15:52.160 --> 15:53.780]  it. Oh my Morgz with another
[15:53.780 --> 15:56.300]  chunky ten. Drop in ten.
[15:56.560 --> 15:58.040]  Thank you so much. Morg-tastic
[15:58.040 --> 16:00.240]  amount. Thank you so much. Taking us to the Morgan back.
[16:01.100 --> 16:02.060]  Thank you, Morgy.
[16:02.180 --> 16:03.100]  I'm killing Nick this round.
[16:03.920 --> 16:04.780]  It's happening. Alright.
[16:05.380 --> 16:08.380]  I'm really unhappy with my car this round.
[16:09.460 --> 16:09.700]  Yeah?
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.420]  Just some pink turd.
[16:12.760 --> 16:13.360]  Tonka twat.
[16:14.020 --> 16:14.900]  Tonka twat.
[16:20.340 --> 16:20.820]  Alright.
[16:21.400 --> 16:23.320]  Alright, it's alright. I didn't know it was you. I thought it was Gavin.
[16:23.740 --> 16:24.820]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[16:25.700 --> 16:27.400]  Staying still. Eating a meat pie.
[16:28.300 --> 16:29.980]  Ha ha ha ha ha
[16:31.280 --> 16:31.640]  Yeah.
[16:32.960 --> 16:33.860]  Get out you schmuck.
[16:34.540 --> 16:35.800]  You remember when there was a boomerang
[16:35.800 --> 16:37.480]  over off the Guadalupe
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.960]  street? Oh yeah.
[16:40.700 --> 16:41.600]  Boomerang pies. Boomerang restaurant.
[16:41.720 --> 16:43.680]  Boomerang pies. Australian pies.
[16:43.880 --> 16:45.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. I never ate there.
[16:45.860 --> 16:47.560]  That place was good. Oh really? Was it good?
[16:48.160 --> 16:50.020]  It was good. Yeah. It was better than
[16:50.020 --> 16:51.200]  it got. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah.
[16:51.620 --> 16:53.960]  I never ate there, but not because I didn't want to or anything.
[16:54.040 --> 16:55.100]  I just never ate there.
[16:56.940 --> 16:57.920]  I did it because
[16:57.920 --> 16:58.880]  I had a Groupon.
[16:59.800 --> 17:00.980]  Do you remember Groupon?
[17:01.640 --> 17:03.900]  Oh man, Groupon. No, I think it's dead.
[17:04.120 --> 17:04.180]  Right?
[17:06.340 --> 17:07.020]  Oh, hello.
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.020]  We should buy Groupon and bring it back.
[17:14.240 --> 17:15.160]  Boop boop boop.
[17:15.580 --> 17:16.960]  I think it's time for Geoff to win.
[17:17.560 --> 17:19.320]  Has a business ever been bought with a coupon?
[17:20.440 --> 17:21.280]  I would assume so.
[17:22.880 --> 17:23.760]  Uh, maybe.
[17:23.760 --> 17:25.800]  Give you a coupon for 15% off
[17:25.800 --> 17:26.600]  one business.
[17:31.260 --> 17:33.920]  Yeah, but if you buy the other one, it's an expiration date.
[17:34.180 --> 17:35.380]  October 30th, 2026.
[17:38.080 --> 17:38.600]  Oh.
[17:39.040 --> 17:40.360]  Where is it, where is it, where is it?
[17:42.080 --> 17:42.600]  Okay.
[17:45.680 --> 17:46.480]  Oh, there's some...
[17:46.480 --> 17:48.800]  There he goes!
[17:49.820 --> 17:51.180]  He got too aggressive.
[17:51.800 --> 17:53.280]  You doofus.
[17:53.280 --> 17:54.940]  That was fucking great.
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.000]  That was full doof butt.
[17:57.580 --> 17:59.180]  Yep. Full doof.
[17:59.420 --> 18:01.600]  Full doof.
[18:03.020 --> 18:03.760]  Idiot flag.
[18:06.060 --> 18:07.680]  Way of a bad...
[18:07.680 --> 18:08.360]  That idiot.
[18:08.480 --> 18:10.480]  Why and make a pretty, uh, hudless.
[18:11.980 --> 18:13.340]  That, uh, that idiot flag.
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.120]  Oh, look at you!
[18:14.460 --> 18:15.800]  We're getting a lot of mileage out of that thing.
[18:16.320 --> 18:18.220]  It's great. I love the idiot flag.
[18:19.520 --> 18:21.600]  Oh, the downside though, Gavin, is we don't know who's who.
[18:21.600 --> 18:22.760]  Oh, that's true.
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.220]  Oh, yes we do. Their names above them.
[18:24.340 --> 18:28.580]  So we're on Andrew. Andrew's watching Gavin and Geoff approach.
[18:28.660 --> 18:29.640]  They also look different colors.
[18:30.140 --> 18:31.460]  They don't look me directly in the eyes.
[18:32.920 --> 18:33.740]  Here comes Gavin!
[18:33.880 --> 18:34.580]  Plenty of room for everybody.
[18:35.720 --> 18:36.300]  For now.
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.420]  I want to be the middle of the sandwich.
[18:39.440 --> 18:40.160]  That's not what I want.
[18:40.280 --> 18:43.460]  Oh, we got idiot pennants arriving to the people in the chat.
[18:43.780 --> 18:44.880]  Oh, hell yeah.
[18:45.480 --> 18:46.640]  Shirts and pennants going out.
[18:47.060 --> 18:50.060]  What item is the middle of the sandwich, do you think?
[18:50.920 --> 18:52.860]  Like, what's smack dab in the middle of the sandwich?
[18:53.420 --> 18:54.580]  It's the meat, right?
[18:55.580 --> 18:56.500]  What's below the meat?
[18:56.780 --> 18:57.760]  No! No!
[18:58.320 --> 18:59.640]  You got me with the meat!
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.900]  You meated me!
[19:01.560 --> 19:04.320]  I don't know. Doesn't it go like bun, meat,
[19:04.420 --> 19:05.680]  and then you put stuff on top of it?
[19:06.660 --> 19:07.160]  Why am I in this angle?
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.800]  I guess a club sandwich, you could have stuff below.
[19:09.380 --> 19:11.020]  A club sandwich, the middle would be a bread.
[19:12.460 --> 19:14.180]  Gavin, how do I get out of the bad angles?
[19:16.240 --> 19:17.040]  It's impossible.
[19:17.040 --> 19:17.080]  It's impossible.
[19:18.600 --> 19:20.040]  Just find a good one.
[19:21.520 --> 19:22.920]  Oh, wait. Never mind.
[19:23.940 --> 19:24.680]  Controls at the bottom.
[19:25.280 --> 19:26.980]  You can go ahead and put the idiot flags back up if you want.
[19:27.800 --> 19:29.000]  I don't think they took them down.
[19:29.600 --> 19:29.760]  Okay.
[19:33.900 --> 19:35.100]  Oh! Yeah!
[19:35.680 --> 19:36.860]  You're gonna kill us both!
[19:37.100 --> 19:37.900]  Both of us!
[19:47.050 --> 19:47.750]  This is fun.
[19:48.030 --> 19:49.790]  Is there, like, no winner that round?
[19:50.650 --> 19:51.810]  Oh, is that really?
[19:52.210 --> 19:52.730]  Everyone loses.
[19:54.130 --> 19:55.930]  Wait, it says Geoff rounds one.
[19:56.110 --> 19:57.410]  It told me I lost.
[19:57.850 --> 19:58.330]  Whatever.
[20:00.090 --> 20:00.410]  What?
[20:01.130 --> 20:03.310]  No, I don't win.
[20:03.930 --> 20:05.910]  It must have said loser,
[20:06.030 --> 20:06.810]  but gave us both a win.
[20:07.910 --> 20:08.650]  I didn't get a win.
[20:08.930 --> 20:10.410]  I didn't see you win on Gavin's.
[20:10.570 --> 20:11.610]  Son of a bitch!
[20:14.810 --> 20:15.890]  That's so unfair!
[20:17.110 --> 20:18.370]  Where's Gavin's win?
[20:21.010 --> 20:22.050]  Oh, no!
[20:23.690 --> 20:25.050]  This game type rules.
[20:25.370 --> 20:26.370]  Yeah, it's fun, right?
[20:27.450 --> 20:29.530]  The other one I want to do is called Overtime Rumble,
[20:29.710 --> 20:31.530]  and it's kind of like Super Monkey Ball
[20:31.530 --> 20:33.790]  in GTA, but it's...
[20:34.350 --> 20:34.910]  Parachute Cobble?
[20:35.330 --> 20:37.570]  Yeah, it rotates in...
[20:37.570 --> 20:38.650]  These all just rotate in.
[20:38.690 --> 20:40.010]  These won't be here next week, probably.
[20:40.310 --> 20:43.950]  It was just pure luck that we thought about them
[20:43.950 --> 20:44.550]  and they were here.
[20:44.550 --> 20:45.630]  Uh-oh!
[20:47.530 --> 20:48.550]  Trying to kill me
[20:48.550 --> 20:49.970]  in the first dome? You serious?
[20:50.270 --> 20:51.670]  No! Every dome.
[20:53.030 --> 20:54.450]  It's not first specific.
[20:55.030 --> 20:56.690]  Yeah, it's not limited to one dome.
[20:56.850 --> 20:57.930]  It's limited to all domes.
[20:58.190 --> 20:59.890]  First dome, second dome, third dome.
[21:01.850 --> 21:02.710]  No dome.
[21:06.230 --> 21:08.210]  Alright, I'm getting wise to you.
[21:08.210 --> 21:08.590]  Boom!
[21:09.450 --> 21:11.110]  Gave you a speed boost.
[21:11.110 --> 21:13.030]  That's not what I want, that's not what I want, that's not what I want.
[21:13.330 --> 21:13.810]  No!
[21:14.890 --> 21:15.530]  Damn it!
[21:17.010 --> 21:19.130]  Went wide again.
[21:23.550 --> 21:26.590]  Hey, don't...
[21:26.590 --> 21:28.950]  Please don't say the D word right now.
[21:30.810 --> 21:31.250]  Uh-oh.
[21:32.410 --> 21:35.530]  Like 1700 calories of D word earlier today.
[21:37.990 --> 21:39.530]  I don't think it was that high, Geoff.
[21:39.530 --> 21:41.530]  Well, I ate seven...
[21:41.530 --> 21:43.470]  Well, I don't want to spoil the video. You might be 200 off.
[21:43.810 --> 21:44.230]  Yeah.
[21:44.630 --> 21:44.970]  Oh!
[21:49.910 --> 21:51.030]  Oh shit!
[21:51.590 --> 21:51.970]  Oh no!
[21:52.970 --> 21:53.850]  All wheel drive!
[21:57.250 --> 21:58.550]  That's what you both get!
[21:59.950 --> 22:00.850]  Take that!
[22:04.330 --> 22:05.190]  That's great.
[22:07.250 --> 22:08.870]  Wait, was that you with me, Gavin?
[22:09.190 --> 22:11.210]  Yeah, I was trying to pull you up.
[22:11.830 --> 22:12.410]  Oh yeah?
[22:13.710 --> 22:15.750]  All wheel drive went a little slow.
[22:15.970 --> 22:16.750]  Forgot my winch.
[22:17.770 --> 22:18.450]  It's pressing Y.
[22:21.090 --> 22:23.270]  Oh, we gotta play the new trucks game next week.
[22:23.310 --> 22:24.090]  I'm so excited.
[22:25.030 --> 22:25.910]  We got a whole new trucks.
[22:27.130 --> 22:28.170]  What's the new trucks game?
[22:28.450 --> 22:28.890]  Roadcraft.
[22:29.810 --> 22:33.870]  Yeah, it's like a sequel to SnowRunner.
[22:33.870 --> 22:36.290]  Where we have to build roads and stuff.
[22:36.770 --> 22:37.770]  I've seen the trailer for it.
[22:37.970 --> 22:39.630]  After Expeditions, I don't know.
[22:39.950 --> 22:41.350]  I thought that was okay, but...
[22:41.350 --> 22:43.990]  Nothing has captured the magic of SnowRunner to me.
[22:44.150 --> 22:44.970]  That SnowRunner has.
[22:45.010 --> 22:47.870]  I hope it does, and I'm fucking super excited about it.
[22:47.970 --> 22:49.250]  But I also...
[22:50.550 --> 22:53.830]  I feel like we have so much SnowRunner left in us, man.
[22:57.230 --> 22:59.290]  You were getting bullied hard there.
[22:59.510 --> 23:00.790]  I don't know how you survived.
[23:03.870 --> 23:04.990]  We've got a long way to go.
[23:05.150 --> 23:09.310]  We filmed a third SnowRunner video.
[23:09.830 --> 23:10.430]  Not too long ago.
[23:11.370 --> 23:12.250]  Or fourth.
[23:12.390 --> 23:14.370]  I don't know which number it is in this series.
[23:14.610 --> 23:15.630]  But I thought it was our best one.
[23:16.430 --> 23:16.870]  It was a good one.
[23:17.170 --> 23:19.570]  It felt like we accomplished some things.
[23:19.770 --> 23:21.530]  No! Let me back in.
[23:24.290 --> 23:27.590]  Yeah, it really felt like me accomplished some things.
[23:27.730 --> 23:28.110]  It did.
[23:30.170 --> 23:32.010]  It felt more competent on...
[23:33.090 --> 23:34.310]  Everybody's getting better.
[23:34.470 --> 23:35.410]  You can tell.
[23:35.810 --> 23:37.650]  Everybody's getting way better.
[23:37.890 --> 23:40.010]  That's some nifty dodging.
[23:42.170 --> 23:43.830]  I think the fun in this is
[23:43.830 --> 23:45.570]  teasing the corners.
[23:46.030 --> 23:47.470]  Yeah, a little corner tease.
[23:49.010 --> 23:49.970]  A little corner slut.
[23:52.830 --> 23:53.790]  Tease it.
[23:54.150 --> 23:54.610]  Tease it.
[23:55.090 --> 23:56.890]  Tease you little corner whore.
[23:56.890 --> 23:59.010]  This is going to be such a small dome.
[23:59.870 --> 24:01.590]  This is going to be such a baby dome.
[24:03.370 --> 24:04.330]  Baby dome.
[24:05.670 --> 24:06.630]  Baby dome.
[24:07.970 --> 24:09.030]  Oh, please no.
[24:15.050 --> 24:15.530]  No!
[24:16.770 --> 24:17.670]  That's not fair!
[24:18.590 --> 24:20.230]  Oh no! Andrew!
[24:20.750 --> 24:21.450]  You'll be fine.
[24:21.590 --> 24:23.270]  You just have to flip it over and get in with me.
[24:23.270 --> 24:24.170]  Geoff's in.
[24:24.530 --> 24:25.570]  Will Andrew make it?
[24:28.730 --> 24:30.050]  I even let you make it.
[24:30.150 --> 24:31.690]  I don't want you to die.
[24:32.430 --> 24:33.750]  It's like a victory turtle.
[24:35.450 --> 24:37.550]  Andrew, you have to win or this might be over.
[24:40.650 --> 24:42.590]  Andrew's not teasing any corners.
[24:42.870 --> 24:43.970]  There he did. He teased that one.
[24:44.550 --> 24:45.090]  Knock it out!
[24:49.050 --> 24:49.810]  Early position.
[24:49.810 --> 24:50.410]  Oh no.
[24:52.030 --> 24:54.770]  Put on both your brake and your...
[24:57.210 --> 24:58.490]  Ran out of time.
[24:59.190 --> 24:59.670]  Shit.
[25:02.370 --> 25:03.150]  That'll happen.
[25:04.830 --> 25:05.750]  Geoff might Geoff it though.
[25:05.810 --> 25:06.930]  He certainly did.
[25:08.590 --> 25:09.830]  Gotta get me a win in here.
[25:09.850 --> 25:11.090]  Gotta get you a win, Gavin.
[25:11.870 --> 25:13.290]  Gotta get you a win.
[25:13.490 --> 25:13.730]  In it.
[25:14.730 --> 25:15.330]  In it.
[25:15.330 --> 25:15.650]  In it?
[25:16.310 --> 25:18.330]  In it.
[25:18.710 --> 25:21.330]  I've noticed that words that start with H...
[25:22.150 --> 25:23.730]  Gavin sounds extra British.
[25:23.850 --> 25:24.190]  Double T's.
[25:24.190 --> 25:24.730]  A hotel.
[25:27.450 --> 25:27.530]  Ed?
[25:30.770 --> 25:32.630]  Welcome to the hotel.
[25:33.650 --> 25:34.210]  California.
[25:35.210 --> 25:36.810]  You guys are...
[25:36.810 --> 25:37.750]  You guys are very funny.
[25:38.710 --> 25:39.670]  You make me laugh.
[25:40.190 --> 25:40.990]  An H is a vowel.
[25:42.490 --> 25:42.870]  What?
[25:43.450 --> 25:44.370]  Smart guy over here.
[25:44.530 --> 25:45.450]  Flexing his knowledge.
[25:47.690 --> 25:48.410]  I got...
[25:48.410 --> 25:49.470]  I got bad news for you, Andrew.
[25:55.470 --> 25:56.730]  I don't know why I said that.
[25:56.790 --> 25:57.250]  You hit me.
[25:57.930 --> 26:00.430]  People are saying they've got amounts of numbers on me.
[26:00.490 --> 26:01.770]  So this is going to be the one I win.
[26:02.670 --> 26:03.830]  Are they betting on you?
[26:05.690 --> 26:06.070]  Yeah.
[26:06.310 --> 26:07.530]  Always bet on Brit.
[26:09.930 --> 26:12.330]  It's really weird that Wesley Snipes said that.
[26:12.530 --> 26:13.170]  I didn't get it.
[26:13.390 --> 26:14.470]  It was very strange.
[26:16.730 --> 26:17.330]  Alright.
[26:17.610 --> 26:18.290]  Tease the corner.
[26:20.490 --> 26:21.190]  No tease.
[26:22.470 --> 26:23.070]  Tease?
[26:23.150 --> 26:23.750]  There's so much space.
[26:24.070 --> 26:24.630]  Slam!
[26:25.430 --> 26:25.670]  Oh!
[26:28.350 --> 26:29.550]  Ha ha!
[26:30.410 --> 26:30.670]  Whoop!
[26:33.290 --> 26:33.730]  Oh!
[26:37.870 --> 26:38.710]  Where's the next one?
[26:40.130 --> 26:40.570]  Ah!
[26:42.570 --> 26:43.010]  Oh!
[26:43.330 --> 26:44.650]  I almost accidentally killed you.
[26:44.710 --> 26:45.450]  That wasn't on purpose.
[26:48.750 --> 26:49.390]  It's close.
[26:49.390 --> 26:51.450]  Could you on purpose kill him next?
[26:51.550 --> 26:52.370]  Because that would be nice.
[26:52.790 --> 26:54.310]  I kind of want him to win one.
[26:55.070 --> 26:55.890]  He hasn't won yet.
[26:56.130 --> 26:57.270]  I'd like him to be part of the group.
[26:57.790 --> 26:58.190]  Meh.
[26:58.830 --> 27:00.650]  He's won enough at life.
[27:02.050 --> 27:02.690]  Goodbye, Gavin.
[27:03.910 --> 27:05.130]  Alright, hold the line, fellas.
[27:05.290 --> 27:05.930]  Here comes Gavin.
[27:07.630 --> 27:08.590]  No takes, he's back.
[27:08.690 --> 27:09.010]  Ah, damn.
[27:11.450 --> 27:12.190]  I forgot.
[27:13.210 --> 27:15.030]  I know I'll forget it a thousand times
[27:15.030 --> 27:16.790]  before now and next year,
[27:16.830 --> 27:19.510]  but I thought of a new nickname for Gavin today for 2026.
[27:19.730 --> 27:20.430]  Oh, shit.
[27:21.350 --> 27:21.550]  Yeah.
[27:22.050 --> 27:24.430]  I got a new one for Eric today, but not for you.
[27:26.570 --> 27:27.390]  Oh, dear.
[27:29.930 --> 27:30.550]  Uh-oh.
[27:30.710 --> 27:31.590]  Is anyone going to come in?
[27:31.950 --> 27:32.430]  Oh, shit.
[27:35.250 --> 27:36.210]  I'm coming in.
[27:36.350 --> 27:37.470]  I'm coming in so hard.
[27:37.490 --> 27:38.010]  I'm coming in hot.
[27:39.590 --> 27:40.850]  Oh, it's so hot.
[27:42.870 --> 27:44.450]  I barely lived there.
[27:44.730 --> 27:45.690]  I barely made it.
[27:45.950 --> 27:47.810]  Some hot coming in there.
[27:48.010 --> 27:48.390]  Whoa!
[27:50.250 --> 27:51.570]  He's a loaded weapon.
[27:51.570 --> 27:52.310]  We gotta watch out.
[27:52.550 --> 27:54.110]  A lot of powdered D.
[28:00.030 --> 28:01.570]  I might not
[28:01.570 --> 28:03.510]  eat another D word for a while
[28:03.510 --> 28:04.490]  after today.
[28:05.270 --> 28:06.210]  The new corn dog?
[28:07.490 --> 28:09.690]  No, I definitely want to continue
[28:09.690 --> 28:11.050]  to consume D.
[28:11.370 --> 28:12.230]  I just...
[28:12.230 --> 28:15.470]  Oh, no!
[28:16.190 --> 28:16.450]  Okay.
[28:17.070 --> 28:17.550]  You alright there?
[28:17.550 --> 28:19.550]  I'm alright. I panicked.
[28:20.750 --> 28:21.750]  It's getting small.
[28:22.890 --> 28:23.690]  It's getting
[28:23.690 --> 28:24.650]  small and far.
[28:26.570 --> 28:27.230]  Shit.
[28:29.130 --> 28:29.250]  Oops.
[28:35.140 --> 28:35.940]  Uh-oh.
[28:37.560 --> 28:39.120]  Hold the line!
[28:39.400 --> 28:39.600]  No!
[28:40.640 --> 28:42.780]  You can't see the edge of the circle.
[28:43.120 --> 28:44.900]  It makes it hard to murder people.
[28:45.880 --> 28:46.080]  Yeah.
[28:46.080 --> 28:47.480]  You do tell off your camera
[28:47.480 --> 28:50.360]  on the outside a little bit.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.740]  Oh, man.
[28:51.860 --> 28:52.800]  How did you live?
[28:54.720 --> 28:56.040]  That was very lucky.
[28:56.700 --> 28:58.000]  That was some good survival
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.860]  there. That was largely luck.
[29:05.310 --> 29:05.570]  Ah!
[29:08.410 --> 29:08.930]  Ah!
[29:09.410 --> 29:09.830]  Pull him!
[29:10.330 --> 29:11.350]  Where did he go?
[29:12.150 --> 29:13.570]  What happened to him?
[29:13.990 --> 29:15.350]  He died before he died.
[29:15.350 --> 29:15.910]  Shit.
[29:16.870 --> 29:18.210]  I got slammed off.
[29:18.930 --> 29:21.110]  By who? Who hit you?
[29:21.350 --> 29:22.410]  I don't know.
[29:22.890 --> 29:23.930]  Did you hit yourself?
[29:24.310 --> 29:26.590]  Did you glug-glug-slam yourself off?
[29:26.930 --> 29:27.970]  Everyone's points.
[29:28.750 --> 29:29.070]  Ah!
[29:29.810 --> 29:30.450]  Oh!
[29:35.860 --> 29:37.540]  Is that a default win for Geoff?
[29:37.660 --> 29:39.080]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[29:39.460 --> 29:39.880]  Yay!
[29:41.080 --> 29:42.400]  Everything's coming up Geoff.
[29:42.960 --> 29:45.420]  Got some idiot flags in the chat.
[29:45.420 --> 29:47.060]  Did I kill you Andrew?
[29:47.200 --> 29:49.060]  Yeah, you did. You launched me off the side.
[29:54.660 --> 29:56.040]  Alright, this one's my round.
[29:57.380 --> 29:58.040]  This is it?
[29:58.560 --> 30:00.040]  Alright, everyone back off and let Gavin win.
[30:00.540 --> 30:01.100]  Or he'll quit.
[30:04.180 --> 30:05.840]  Do you ever have a friend like that where you knew,
[30:06.100 --> 30:08.200]  if we don't let him win this next round, he's gonna go home
[30:08.200 --> 30:09.320]  and then we don't have enough people to play.
[30:09.680 --> 30:12.300]  I was supposed to play the library on Halo with my friend
[30:12.300 --> 30:14.380]  and he died and I took his shotgun
[30:14.960 --> 30:15.960]  to kill some flood
[30:15.960 --> 30:17.300]  because you kinda need the shotgun
[30:17.300 --> 30:20.100]  and I wouldn't give it back because there's shotguns everywhere.
[30:20.300 --> 30:21.680]  I was like, I don't want to have to swap
[30:21.680 --> 30:23.920]  and do all this shit. Why don't you just pick up another shotgun?
[30:24.100 --> 30:24.800]  And he went home.
[30:27.900 --> 30:29.840]  See? Home! Did you hear him say home?
[30:30.280 --> 30:31.200]  Yeah, he left.
[30:32.460 --> 30:33.640]  He stormed off. I was like,
[30:33.740 --> 30:34.480]  bloody hell.
[30:37.540 --> 30:40.100]  So he went home and then you went bloody hell.
[30:41.680 --> 30:42.040]  Crazy.
[30:43.180 --> 30:44.620]  Like from a young age
[30:44.620 --> 30:46.120]  you decided to stick your, like,
[30:46.180 --> 30:47.940]  hold your crown, put your fleet in
[30:47.940 --> 30:49.320]  instead of just giving the shotgun.
[30:50.020 --> 30:52.100]  It's hard to give someone's shotgun
[30:52.100 --> 30:54.060]  back when you can't find shit all over the ground.
[30:54.180 --> 30:55.680]  That's true. That is very fair.
[30:55.720 --> 30:57.900]  I was just like, surely it's easier for me to
[30:58.360 --> 31:00.080]  sit to the back and not pick up
[31:00.080 --> 31:01.900]  a shotgun ammo and then you just pick up a new one.
[31:02.380 --> 31:04.340]  Yeah, there's a ton. They're all over the place.
[31:04.620 --> 31:05.800]  Yeah, I think his was like
[31:05.800 --> 31:06.740]  warm or something.
[31:07.600 --> 31:09.080]  He took his shotgun and he went home.
[31:09.500 --> 31:10.180]  Yeah, he did.
[31:10.560 --> 31:12.560]  There were many like it, but that one was mine.
[31:14.960 --> 31:16.200]  Audience, you're not going to be able to see this, but
[31:23.720 --> 31:24.880]  There we go. They saw it.
[31:25.060 --> 31:25.880]  I came over to you.
[31:27.120 --> 31:27.560]  I came too.
[31:28.400 --> 31:29.600]  What? Huh?
[31:30.780 --> 31:31.060]  What?
[31:32.880 --> 31:33.920]  Oh, it's Starhawk.
[31:34.760 --> 31:35.880]  Why'd you do that, Nick?
[31:36.920 --> 31:37.860]  Did I do that?
[31:38.000 --> 31:38.900]  No. I think it's just the map.
[31:39.040 --> 31:40.440]  I can't believe Nintendo's done this.
[31:43.160 --> 31:44.520]  I've watched that clip so much.
[31:44.620 --> 31:45.880]  Did you guys in chat see what
[31:45.880 --> 31:47.360]  Nintendo did during our
[31:47.980 --> 31:48.840]  anniversary stream?
[31:48.980 --> 31:51.700]  Really, really disappointed in Nintendo for that.
[31:51.940 --> 31:52.720]  I was too.
[31:54.860 --> 31:56.020]  I expected more
[31:56.020 --> 31:57.000]  from their UI.
[31:58.680 --> 31:59.120]  What?
[32:00.180 --> 32:01.040]  Oh, Geoff's pink this time.
[32:02.220 --> 32:03.240]  Who was that?
[32:03.240 --> 32:04.000]  You're back in the circle.
[32:07.880 --> 32:09.080]  Handbrakes have been disabled.
[32:09.280 --> 32:10.460]  Oh, look at you.
[32:10.960 --> 32:12.520]  You've got the Bond car.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.960]  I've got a little DB5, innit?
[32:14.820 --> 32:16.020]  Is that what that is?
[32:17.700 --> 32:19.160]  He's Jimmy Bonding.
[32:20.020 --> 32:21.220]  Does the D stand for
[32:21.220 --> 32:22.880]  donuts? Because if it does,
[32:23.020 --> 32:23.800]  stay the fuck away.
[32:27.260 --> 32:29.000]  Oh man, it's like bumper cars,
[32:29.120 --> 32:31.480]  but every time you get rammed, a donut launches into your vehicle.
[32:31.480 --> 32:33.840]  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[32:33.940 --> 32:34.260]  Yeah!
[32:35.160 --> 32:37.700]  Geoff, how much would it take for you to go to Voodoo Donuts
[32:37.700 --> 32:38.340]  tonight for dinner?
[32:43.420 --> 32:45.300]  I would do it for $400.
[32:46.100 --> 32:46.500]  Whoa!
[32:47.500 --> 32:48.480]  I'll pitch in $100.
[32:49.280 --> 32:51.520]  Damn. I'm okay with him feeling better.
[32:52.700 --> 32:53.320]  Thanks, Andrew.
[32:53.740 --> 32:54.980]  I don't need him to be worse.
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.560]  Ugh, that was rough.
[32:57.040 --> 32:59.680]  I'm just curious, if you had to, let's say you did it,
[32:59.680 --> 33:01.100]  what donut would you go with?
[33:01.700 --> 33:03.040]  Right, if you did. At Voodoo Donuts?
[33:03.680 --> 33:04.500]  Yeah, at Voodoo.
[33:04.560 --> 33:07.480]  They have a lavender donut that I really like there.
[33:07.980 --> 33:08.580]  Oh, yeah.
[33:09.640 --> 33:10.680]  Lavender's not food.
[33:11.380 --> 33:12.540]  Shut up. It's a flavor.
[33:13.640 --> 33:15.300]  It's really good. It's a scent.
[33:17.140 --> 33:19.660]  You know rose is a scent, but also it can be food.
[33:19.800 --> 33:21.860]  Yeah, I just don't think you should eat a rose either.
[33:26.020 --> 33:27.900]  So, Titanic hit differently for you, I guess.
[33:27.900 --> 33:29.960]  Oh, wow!
[33:32.120 --> 33:33.240]  That could have been bad.
[33:33.940 --> 33:35.560]  That could have been real bad.
[33:36.420 --> 33:38.060]  I didn't realize that hole was right there.
[33:42.480 --> 33:43.720]  You know, when I was in high school,
[33:43.760 --> 33:45.800]  I had a Datsun 200SX.
[33:46.320 --> 33:46.940]  And it looked kind of...
[33:46.940 --> 33:49.680]  1981 Datsun 200SX, and it looked kind of like this car.
[33:50.500 --> 33:52.420]  Which car had the jack-in-the-box ball on it?
[33:53.620 --> 33:56.200]  The one before... the one after the Datsun.
[33:56.200 --> 33:57.040]  Oh, okay.
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.980]  That was my Buick Century.
[33:59.740 --> 34:01.440]  This was the one that I had to...
[34:01.440 --> 34:04.040]  I sold for parts.
[34:05.960 --> 34:07.820]  And the guy came to pick the car up,
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.240]  and I couldn't find the keys, and he's like,
[34:09.280 --> 34:10.460]  that's okay, I just need the parts anyway.
[34:12.040 --> 34:13.560]  No, no, that wasn't how it went at all.
[34:13.860 --> 34:16.320]  He goes, the car didn't run anymore.
[34:16.500 --> 34:18.020]  Because I had beaten the shit out of it.
[34:18.080 --> 34:19.140]  I used to kick it a lot.
[34:20.160 --> 34:21.340]  I was in high school, you know.
[34:21.740 --> 34:24.160]  I used to run over a lot of signs with it to be funny.
[34:24.160 --> 34:25.300]  You know, just do dumb stuff.
[34:28.020 --> 34:29.980]  Anyway, so he's like,
[34:30.020 --> 34:32.560]  the car didn't run, it's a piece of shit, he gave me 200 bucks for it.
[34:32.680 --> 34:33.600]  And I'm like, that's a bargain.
[34:34.060 --> 34:35.660]  And then he goes, can I get the keys to open it up?
[34:35.680 --> 34:37.480]  And I had lost the keys, and I was like, I don't have the keys.
[34:37.640 --> 34:39.960]  And he's like, god damn it, the only thing good on this was the window.
[34:42.180 --> 34:44.560]  He just drove off.
[34:45.040 --> 34:47.120]  Oh, I almost drove out the back before this ended.
[34:49.860 --> 34:51.880]  The only good thing was the window.
[34:51.880 --> 34:54.080]  The only thing I was good at was the window.
[35:04.060 --> 35:05.460]  Holy shit, dude.
[35:05.720 --> 35:06.640]  Oh, I'm so dead.
[35:07.180 --> 35:09.340]  You got plenty of time to make it back, though.
[35:09.340 --> 35:09.940]  You'll be fine.
[35:11.200 --> 35:12.460]  Go, Andrew, you can do it!
[35:15.420 --> 35:16.780]  Wow, hell yeah, dude.
[35:17.860 --> 35:19.200]  Hell, what a recovery, Andrew.
[35:19.440 --> 35:20.300]  What a recovery.
[35:20.640 --> 35:22.540]  I thought I'd see the last of you.
[35:22.540 --> 35:23.720]  So did I.
[35:26.700 --> 35:28.260]  Get to this one first.
[35:29.260 --> 35:29.840]  I'm in.
[35:31.260 --> 35:32.760]  Now nothing can go wrong.
[35:33.300 --> 35:33.560]  Boom!
[35:33.780 --> 35:35.060]  I said nothing can go wrong.
[35:36.300 --> 35:36.900]  Hey!
[35:39.020 --> 35:40.540]  Everything's going wrong!
[35:40.860 --> 35:41.200]  Don't go.
[35:42.640 --> 35:43.540]  Die! Die, you motherfucker!
[35:43.540 --> 35:45.060]  Oh, you prick, you fucked me!
[35:52.540 --> 35:55.040]  Oh, you absolute sausage casing.
[35:55.420 --> 35:56.800]  Sausage casing.
[35:59.160 --> 36:00.920]  Damn it.
[36:02.220 --> 36:03.700]  Oh, Christ.
[36:11.980 --> 36:13.140]  Who's purple?
[36:13.580 --> 36:14.040]  I'm purple.
[36:14.900 --> 36:16.380]  Oh, we all made it.
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.560]  That was nice. That was good teamwork.
[36:20.680 --> 36:21.100]  Okay.
[36:21.100 --> 36:21.220]  Okay.
[36:24.620 --> 36:25.260]  Let's see.
[36:25.440 --> 36:26.160]  Oh, no! Oh, no!
[36:26.420 --> 36:26.940]  Oh, Geoff!
[36:28.740 --> 36:29.960]  Oh, that hole!
[36:30.180 --> 36:31.600]  That hole is so tiny.
[36:31.740 --> 36:33.180]  I keep forgetting about the no handbrake.
[36:35.180 --> 36:36.180]  There's no handbrake?
[36:37.480 --> 36:39.460]  There's a hambrake.
[36:40.060 --> 36:40.920]  That was earlier.
[36:43.340 --> 36:44.320]  Oh, I'm in.
[36:47.440 --> 36:48.280]  Sudden death!
[36:48.280 --> 36:49.280]  You little shit.
[36:49.780 --> 36:50.840]  Oh, now it's going to shrink.
[36:54.100 --> 36:55.680]  It's going to be a shrinking hole.
[36:55.960 --> 36:56.300]  Where's Gavin?
[36:57.160 --> 36:58.360]  Gavin's getting out of the pool.
[37:04.370 --> 37:05.890]  Forgot about the handbrake again.
[37:10.210 --> 37:10.770]  Four.
[37:11.150 --> 37:11.630]  Three.
[37:12.030 --> 37:12.390]  Two.
[37:12.690 --> 37:18.550]  Oh, now you just force them out.
[37:19.150 --> 37:19.590]  Who out?
[37:19.590 --> 37:21.470]  You out.
[37:22.510 --> 37:23.430]  Force anyone out.
[37:25.170 --> 37:26.830]  Oh, no!
[37:27.650 --> 37:28.190]  Oh, no!
[37:29.230 --> 37:30.270]  Why am I slower?
[37:31.410 --> 37:33.590]  Uh-oh!
[37:37.330 --> 37:38.690]  No, Geoff!
[37:39.330 --> 37:39.870]  Geoff!
[37:43.190 --> 37:44.430]  Fuck!
[37:45.810 --> 37:46.350]  Thank you.
[37:48.210 --> 37:48.650]  Hey!
[37:49.130 --> 37:51.370]  I couldn't figure out how to turn the car around.
[37:55.250 --> 37:57.070]  Is Albert allowed to visit the office?
[37:57.190 --> 37:58.510]  I assume so, but he hasn't yet.
[38:00.050 --> 38:01.310]  Albert likes to eat stuff,
[38:01.470 --> 38:03.210]  and there's a lot of expensive stuff on the ground.
[38:04.390 --> 38:06.250]  Andrew and Albert would be great, though.
[38:07.630 --> 38:09.990]  If Albert pissed in every room
[38:09.990 --> 38:11.170]  in the new office,
[38:11.190 --> 38:11.930]  I don't think we'd notice.
[38:13.370 --> 38:15.870]  I think there's been plenty of pre-Albert piss.
[38:16.550 --> 38:17.510]  In that building.
[38:17.690 --> 38:20.290]  Although, I gotta say, the pistion doesn't smell nearly as bad
[38:20.290 --> 38:22.010]  since we left the fan on 24 hours a day.
[38:24.590 --> 38:25.750]  Yeah, the fan's a good call.
[38:27.070 --> 38:28.430]  A little air purifier thing?
[38:30.010 --> 38:30.810]  That plus the fan.
[38:32.530 --> 38:33.030]  Oh, I see.
[38:33.550 --> 38:35.570]  It's made a real difference.
[38:35.950 --> 38:37.010]  We've also got the cooling lamp,
[38:37.110 --> 38:38.530]  which we could potentially leave on.
[38:38.530 --> 38:39.890]  100%, yeah.
[38:46.750 --> 38:48.230]  Get Gavin! He's coming in!
[38:48.810 --> 38:49.670]  No, g-g-g-g-guh!
[38:50.050 --> 38:50.670]  Oh, shit!
[38:51.790 --> 38:53.290]  No, g-g-g-g-g-guh!
[38:56.030 --> 38:56.830]  Oh, God.
[38:57.870 --> 38:58.310]  Silly.
[38:59.310 --> 39:00.710]  He got slapped up.
[39:01.550 --> 39:02.030]  Sumo slap.
[39:03.950 --> 39:04.710]  I hear you.
[39:04.710 --> 39:06.130]  I hear you.
[39:09.440 --> 39:10.620]  My door opened.
[39:10.920 --> 39:12.340]  My door fell off!
[39:13.360 --> 39:14.240]  Taking your door.
[39:14.520 --> 39:15.780]  Bring my door back.
[39:16.260 --> 39:18.460]  No, I want the other one.
[39:21.580 --> 39:22.200]  Yeah, get him!
[39:22.400 --> 39:23.360]  Get him! Fuck him up!
[39:23.680 --> 39:24.440]  Fuck him up!
[39:25.280 --> 39:28.500]  Whoa, no! The timer! I thought it was safe!
[39:30.200 --> 39:31.140]  No, don't!
[39:31.600 --> 39:32.220]  Thank you.
[39:34.620 --> 39:36.160]  And Geoff wins again.
[39:36.160 --> 39:37.120]  What a win!
[39:37.280 --> 39:38.860]  That was over pretty quickly.
[39:44.870 --> 39:46.510]  We were played by hand.
[39:48.590 --> 39:50.130]  Oh, Jesus Christ, man.
[39:50.210 --> 39:50.870]  Oh, God.
[39:51.530 --> 39:54.930]  Sounds like we're in a market for a new sumo.
[39:55.090 --> 39:55.950]  Sumo four.
[39:59.110 --> 40:00.850]  I haven't won a single round.
[40:05.990 --> 40:07.270]  This is the one.
[40:07.710 --> 40:09.690]  How did you get more money than me, though?
[40:10.070 --> 40:10.830]  Good, son.
[40:14.970 --> 40:15.930]  Get him!
[40:16.370 --> 40:17.770]  I deserve that.
[40:19.710 --> 40:20.670]  You motherfucker.
[40:23.850 --> 40:25.090]  There's so many of these.
[40:25.130 --> 40:26.150]  These are awesome, bitch.
[40:26.610 --> 40:27.370]  I think there's seven.
[40:28.770 --> 40:30.830]  And there's some similar game types, too.
[40:30.830 --> 40:31.990]  There's one called Hunting Grounds.
[40:32.430 --> 40:33.090]  Which, do you remember, Gavin?
[40:33.190 --> 40:33.890]  I think that's in here, too.
[40:33.990 --> 40:37.970]  It's like this, but you're chasing somebody.
[40:38.550 --> 40:39.050]  I feel like.
[40:40.030 --> 40:41.530]  In GTA, you're chasing someone?
[40:42.450 --> 40:42.810]  Yeah.
[40:43.810 --> 40:44.650]  Trying to kill someone?
[40:45.750 --> 40:46.690]  Something like that.
[40:47.090 --> 40:48.070]  Is it like the Ice-T movie?
[40:49.390 --> 40:50.190]  Alright, here we go.
[40:51.850 --> 40:52.570]  Never mind.
[40:55.270 --> 40:56.290]  Alright, let's do it.
[40:56.450 --> 40:58.710]  You saw how much I remembered of our own Minecraft builds.
[41:01.310 --> 41:02.970]  Other people's GTA games?
[41:04.890 --> 41:06.030]  Pretty tall order.
[41:06.470 --> 41:08.790]  So you think roses should just be flowers, Gavin?
[41:09.370 --> 41:10.110]  Flowers are flowers.
[41:11.610 --> 41:12.390]  Flowers are flowers.
[41:16.030 --> 41:18.410]  You listen to Kiss From A Rose and just go,
[41:18.470 --> 41:20.610]  this is some bullshit. He's just lying.
[41:21.210 --> 41:21.910]  They don't do that.
[41:22.610 --> 41:24.790]  Do it, Geoff.
[41:24.790 --> 41:26.510]  Blah, blah, blah.
[41:26.830 --> 41:27.330]  Blah, blah, blah.
[41:28.430 --> 41:30.190]  Thank you so much, Captain Subs.
[41:30.610 --> 41:31.650]  Captain Petard.
[41:33.810 --> 41:35.110]  Captain Petard.
[41:35.630 --> 41:36.870]  Really appreciate it.
[41:39.590 --> 41:40.310]  Dinkleberg!
[41:41.950 --> 41:43.170]  Oh, I should ready up.
[41:44.810 --> 41:45.830]  I had a real issue with that.
[41:49.440 --> 41:50.160]  Ooh.
[41:50.500 --> 41:52.000]  Oh, I'm a fancy car.
[41:52.740 --> 41:53.160]  Yeah.
[41:53.160 --> 41:53.260]  Yeah.
[41:57.020 --> 41:58.740]  What is this?
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.940]  It's like a big octopus.
[42:08.350 --> 42:12.230]  He did a Connery impression
[42:12.230 --> 42:14.410]  of the Bond film that he was in.
[42:16.590 --> 42:18.170]  Nick likes to imagine
[42:18.170 --> 42:20.290]  that Sean Connery was in all the Bond films.
[42:20.930 --> 42:24.150]  You guys doing James Bond quotes?
[42:24.150 --> 42:24.610]  I got one.
[42:24.790 --> 42:26.090]  We named the dog Indiana.
[42:29.730 --> 42:31.190]  Oh, the skyfall.
[42:32.550 --> 42:34.230]  My favorite one was when that lift
[42:34.230 --> 42:34.870]  didn't close.
[42:36.770 --> 42:37.250]  Closure.
[42:40.010 --> 42:40.970]  Thank you.
[42:41.470 --> 42:42.810]  You're about to go off there, Geoff.
[42:43.110 --> 42:43.970]  Yeah, you saved me.
[42:44.330 --> 42:45.850]  Yeah, that was me.
[42:47.810 --> 42:49.110]  Just doing circles.
[42:50.610 --> 42:51.690]  Gavin, no handbrake.
[42:52.850 --> 42:53.910]  God's sake, man.
[42:54.170 --> 42:55.210]  Ow. Ow.
[42:57.450 --> 42:59.150]  Please, sir. I want to live.
[43:02.310 --> 43:03.790]  Alright, what's the way out of here?
[43:04.170 --> 43:04.710]  Not that way.
[43:05.910 --> 43:06.250]  It's tricky.
[43:06.750 --> 43:08.350]  That wasn't on purpose.
[43:09.790 --> 43:10.970]  I was just trying to leave.
[43:12.570 --> 43:12.890]  Hi, Geoff.
[43:13.090 --> 43:13.310]  Hello.
[43:16.870 --> 43:17.310]  Oof.
[43:17.570 --> 43:18.450]  That was close there, huh?
[43:19.310 --> 43:19.910]  Handbrake.
[43:20.050 --> 43:22.370]  Oh, my controller died.
[43:22.670 --> 43:23.850]  My controller died.
[43:24.590 --> 43:26.010]  I was sailing up the edge.
[43:28.130 --> 43:30.210]  I almost followed him because I was gonna
[43:30.210 --> 43:31.590]  knock this shit out of him.
[43:39.050 --> 43:39.650]  No.
[43:40.470 --> 43:40.970]  Dickhead.
[43:43.690 --> 43:44.930]  Oh, Christ.
[43:45.830 --> 43:46.370]  Hey, what do you
[43:46.370 --> 43:47.390]  think you're doing?
[43:47.390 --> 43:48.630]  Oh, prick.
[43:54.350 --> 43:55.710]  I'll leave the other one.
[43:57.470 --> 43:58.370]  Dick, you
[43:58.370 --> 43:58.990]  slag.
[43:59.990 --> 44:01.770]  Oh, you slag.
[44:02.290 --> 44:02.750]  You slag.
[44:04.070 --> 44:05.270]  Shut it, you slag.
[44:05.350 --> 44:06.130]  Where is it?
[44:07.050 --> 44:08.410]  You made it.
[44:09.550 --> 44:18.080]  Who are you looking at?
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.920]  No handbrake in that.
[44:22.400 --> 44:23.280]  No handbrake.
[44:25.020 --> 44:25.980]  Oh, shit. Geoff.
[44:26.100 --> 44:26.860]  Geoff, the handbrake.
[44:26.960 --> 44:27.560]  What's up? I'm Geoff.
[44:31.640 --> 44:33.580]  Alright. Off we go.
[44:34.520 --> 44:35.720]  Off you go.
[44:36.740 --> 44:37.200]  Oh, shit.
[44:43.500 --> 44:45.400]  Thanks for the turbo boost.
[44:49.000 --> 44:49.840]  Did Andrew
[44:49.840 --> 44:50.980]  go off the edge of this car?
[44:51.120 --> 44:52.000]  Yeah, I sure did.
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.780]  I yelled handbrake and my controller died.
[45:00.740 --> 45:02.920]  I knocked the fuck out of Geoff.
[45:03.840 --> 45:05.660]  I just watched him scrape upside down.
[45:07.440 --> 45:10.020]  I put my hand out to stop it, but it wouldn't.
[45:13.930 --> 45:15.410]  What are you doing there?
[45:15.830 --> 45:17.230]  Just sitting back.
[45:17.950 --> 45:19.490]  Oh, don't forget the handbrake.
[45:19.490 --> 45:20.430]  Handbrake, handbrake.
[45:22.930 --> 45:24.050]  Start cranking.
[45:30.420 --> 45:30.700]  Yes!
[45:33.320 --> 45:34.220]  Pro move.
[45:35.180 --> 45:36.380]  I don't know why I did that.
[45:36.440 --> 45:37.360]  I should have faced you.
[45:41.420 --> 45:42.900]  Why did I do that?
[45:43.100 --> 45:44.540]  Got a point in the bag.
[45:47.220 --> 45:48.740]  There is but one target
[45:48.740 --> 45:49.460]  this round.
[45:51.420 --> 45:52.240]  That's Gavin.
[45:52.960 --> 45:53.440]  Why?
[45:54.840 --> 45:55.440]  He killed me.
[45:56.980 --> 45:58.120]  And you won a game.
[45:58.580 --> 45:59.500]  Everybody is upset.
[45:59.500 --> 46:00.840]  They want to say you were supposed to lose.
[46:02.420 --> 46:03.540]  There's some people betting.
[46:03.780 --> 46:05.560]  There's some people putting their money on
[46:05.560 --> 46:06.520]  Gavy here.
[46:07.320 --> 46:08.680]  That was a fluke, I'm afraid.
[46:11.120 --> 46:11.780]  Well, maybe not.
[46:11.880 --> 46:12.200]  Let's see.
[46:12.600 --> 46:13.480]  I'm doing my best.
[46:14.680 --> 46:17.460]  I think my favorite part of today was when we
[46:17.460 --> 46:18.940]  ripped up all of our desks
[46:18.940 --> 46:21.120]  and picked a rug up to run cables under the rug.
[46:21.560 --> 46:23.300]  And then after we were done putting it all back
[46:23.740 --> 46:25.540]  I asked Nick if he had any cables
[46:25.540 --> 46:26.800]  to run and he was like, yeah.
[46:28.800 --> 46:31.160]  And we had to do it all again.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.520]  Does anybody want to come
[46:33.520 --> 46:34.300]  bunce me up?
[46:34.660 --> 46:37.780]  I'm in a little car and my back tires fell off.
[46:38.100 --> 46:38.640]  Wait, what?
[46:39.120 --> 46:39.600]  Where are you?
[46:41.760 --> 46:42.860]  How did you do it?
[46:42.880 --> 46:44.040]  I can't reach you, Geoff.
[46:44.040 --> 46:44.680]  We can't get there.
[46:44.880 --> 46:47.120]  My car's on fire.
[46:47.600 --> 46:48.740]  I can't go anywhere.
[46:50.080 --> 46:52.120]  Oh, I just saw an explosion in the distance.
[46:52.580 --> 46:53.320]  Oh, he went.
[46:54.340 --> 46:56.320]  I backed up to get a good run up
[46:56.320 --> 46:57.820]  and I backed up a little bit too far.
[46:58.680 --> 46:59.680]  Yeah, I see you.
[46:59.960 --> 47:01.240]  Your bump is still there.
[47:04.180 --> 47:05.920]  Paint it white like one of those bicycles
[47:05.920 --> 47:07.940]  and put flowers on it and then people can remember me.
[47:10.980 --> 47:11.600]  Where's Gavin?
[47:11.600 --> 47:12.800]  Oh, there he is.
[47:14.300 --> 47:14.700]  Hello.
[47:16.060 --> 47:17.720]  My favorite part of when you guys were lifting
[47:17.720 --> 47:19.800]  the rug up is I fell asleep. That was great.
[47:20.300 --> 47:20.900]  Did you really?
[47:22.120 --> 47:23.640]  Eventually, yeah. I woke up
[47:23.640 --> 47:25.460]  and I was like, oh, fuck. It was 40 minutes.
[47:25.580 --> 47:26.440]  The office was empty.
[47:27.360 --> 47:28.580]  Did watching us do
[47:29.960 --> 47:31.460]  exerting ourselves make you tired?
[47:31.860 --> 47:33.420]  No, it was just nothing was going on.
[47:33.460 --> 47:35.080]  We were done rapping. I was just hanging out.
[47:37.100 --> 47:39.780]  It was just us picking up the carpet and then putting it back down
[47:39.780 --> 47:41.320]  and picking it up and then putting it down.
[47:41.920 --> 47:43.940]  I had left the RoboCam
[47:43.940 --> 47:46.100]  for a moment and then came back and the carpet
[47:46.100 --> 47:48.460]  was lifted and I was trying to figure out what was going on.
[47:51.280 --> 47:52.500]  There's a lot of carpet moving.
[47:52.700 --> 47:55.260]  We got our computers coming in and I was laying down the old
[47:55.260 --> 47:56.220]  networking cables.
[47:57.380 --> 47:59.340]  And then I ran some
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.600]  audio cables.
[48:02.260 --> 48:02.980]  And I helped.
[48:03.640 --> 48:04.300]  And Eric didn't.
[48:04.800 --> 48:07.700]  Yeah, Eric really didn't.
[48:07.700 --> 48:08.540]  He really didn't.
[48:08.620 --> 48:10.160]  He wasn't feeling well.
[48:10.380 --> 48:11.780]  Were you?
[48:12.240 --> 48:17.640]  The last thing I remember hearing was Eric saying
[48:17.640 --> 48:19.440]  he almost fell asleep watching TikTok
[48:19.440 --> 48:20.140]  in the corner.
[48:20.500 --> 48:22.960]  He said he was sugar crashing.
[48:23.380 --> 48:25.440]  His head was just like slumping down while he was
[48:25.440 --> 48:26.160]  listening to TikTok.
[48:29.920 --> 48:32.000]  It really takes its time to change characters.
[48:32.460 --> 48:33.660]  Yeah, it really does, doesn't it?
[48:35.880 --> 48:38.040]  Alright, so we're watching Gavin.
[48:38.040 --> 48:39.400]  I'm orange.
[48:41.160 --> 48:42.120]  I'm pink.
[48:42.780 --> 48:43.840]  Yeah, it says Andrew
[48:43.840 --> 48:44.840]  Panton above your car.
[48:46.080 --> 48:48.140]  Well, Gavin said his name, so I wanted
[48:48.140 --> 48:49.040]  to say mine too.
[48:50.240 --> 48:51.520]  My name isn't orange.
[48:51.740 --> 48:53.720]  Oh, you're not?
[48:54.420 --> 48:54.900]  Well,
[48:56.160 --> 48:58.060]  it would be if it was above your car right now.
[48:58.280 --> 48:58.540]  Let's see.
[49:00.180 --> 49:00.660]  Good point.
[49:02.200 --> 49:03.660]  You gonna make the jump?
[49:04.700 --> 49:05.020]  Hamburg!
[49:05.020 --> 49:05.280]  Hamburg!
[49:06.420 --> 49:06.940]  Yeah!
[49:09.640 --> 49:10.400]  Don't get him!
[49:10.600 --> 49:11.760]  Don't fuck him up! Knock him off!
[49:12.660 --> 49:13.740]  Yeah, your name's orange.
[49:17.240 --> 49:17.440]  Bah!
[49:19.520 --> 49:20.700]  Oh, he lived.
[49:24.140 --> 49:25.480]  You gotta beat him.
[49:25.820 --> 49:26.600]  Damn it!
[49:27.240 --> 49:28.680]  I thought I had you.
[49:30.580 --> 49:31.360]  Now you do.
[49:31.360 --> 49:33.020]  Don't let him stop.
[49:33.140 --> 49:33.920]  Uh-oh.
[49:34.660 --> 49:36.560]  Get out the frickin' way!
[49:36.720 --> 49:37.760]  Go, Andrew, go!
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.620]  I gotta make it!
[49:41.300 --> 49:41.940]  Come on!
[49:43.100 --> 49:44.000]  Uh-oh!
[49:45.280 --> 49:46.940]  He's right up your ass, dude.
[49:47.260 --> 49:48.860]  He's right up your crev!
[49:49.560 --> 49:49.660]  Oh!
[49:50.780 --> 49:51.780]  And I live!
[49:53.220 --> 49:54.640]  That was bullshit!
[49:56.040 --> 49:57.040]  It was,
[49:57.080 --> 49:57.940]  but I'll take it!
[49:58.800 --> 49:59.540]  That was
[49:59.540 --> 50:00.300]  toss!
[50:04.660 --> 50:06.640]  I don't know how that worked.
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.240]  It worked well.
[50:10.560 --> 50:11.660]  Shower of shit.
[50:12.100 --> 50:12.720]  I ain't complaining.
[50:14.460 --> 50:15.820]  You were so close, Gavin.
[50:16.360 --> 50:17.520]  Shower of shit.
[50:19.680 --> 50:20.760]  Alright, here we go.
[50:22.360 --> 50:24.280]  He so lightly tapped you as well.
[50:25.340 --> 50:25.600]  Alright,
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.000]  everybody don't back up too far.
[50:27.300 --> 50:28.440]  A lot of people are making that mistake.
[50:29.540 --> 50:31.240]  I'm just gonna hold down the right trigger
[50:31.240 --> 50:32.700]  and press nothing else right here.
[50:35.880 --> 50:36.780]  Oh, I should stop.
[50:40.000 --> 50:40.820]  Yes, you should.
[50:44.620 --> 50:45.380]  Geoff's waiting.
[50:46.340 --> 50:47.080]  Geoff's biding.
[50:50.080 --> 50:50.540]  Ow.
[50:52.740 --> 50:53.100]  Ow.
[50:53.320 --> 50:54.480]  Help me! Help me get Gavin!
[50:54.920 --> 50:56.460]  Push him! Push him to the edge!
[50:56.800 --> 50:57.680]  Oh, I was trying!
[50:58.400 --> 50:59.500]  Actually, I don't like that phrasing.
[51:00.760 --> 51:01.680]  You wanna edge him?
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.100]  Yeah, everybody help us edge Gavin.
[51:04.560 --> 51:05.380]  Yeah, let's edge him out.
[51:06.420 --> 51:08.160]  If you don't say edge him off, you're fine.
[51:08.760 --> 51:09.880]  Then why did you say it?
[51:10.460 --> 51:11.480]  I didn't. I said out.
[51:11.720 --> 51:13.860]  But the off, if you get off, you haven't edged.
[51:15.040 --> 51:15.680]  That's true.
[51:16.040 --> 51:17.540]  The edging has failed at that point.
[51:17.540 --> 51:18.760]  Let's edge him on.
[51:19.120 --> 51:20.520]  You can't edge someone off.
[51:24.260 --> 51:24.800]  Huh.
[51:25.700 --> 51:27.000]  I hadn't considered that.
[51:27.420 --> 51:29.280]  You're just bad at edging at that point.
[51:29.700 --> 51:30.540]  You know what?
[51:31.180 --> 51:32.040]  I give up.
[51:32.200 --> 51:33.300]  Aw, tease me off.
[51:33.800 --> 51:35.260]  Now you're getting it, Nick.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.360]  I saw that.
[51:44.200 --> 51:45.640]  Oh, Andrew, sorry!
[51:45.640 --> 51:46.920]  Oh, shit!
[51:47.580 --> 51:48.520]  Do you live? Good.
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.540]  That was an intentional bumping.
[51:50.900 --> 51:51.540]  Nick!
[51:54.860 --> 51:56.640]  He was looking at you.
[51:56.980 --> 51:58.640]  The front works as a ramp.
[52:02.970 --> 52:05.290]  Well, live and learn.
[52:05.470 --> 52:05.850]  Or die.
[52:05.930 --> 52:06.670]  Live and learn.
[52:07.970 --> 52:09.050]  Live and learn.
[52:09.050 --> 52:11.050]  Live and learn.
[52:18.770 --> 52:20.630]  That was a real polite...
[52:21.570 --> 52:22.450]  You go first.
[52:22.590 --> 52:22.990]  No, you go.
[52:23.770 --> 52:25.170]  Now you go.
[52:28.570 --> 52:29.910]  Andrew, why are you edging in?
[52:30.550 --> 52:30.850]  Yeah.
[52:31.650 --> 52:33.270]  Oh, so you can edge in, but you can't edge off.
[52:33.430 --> 52:35.370]  Yeah, absolutely can't.
[52:35.370 --> 52:36.150]  I'm getting it.
[52:36.150 --> 52:36.990]  I started to be sneaky.
[52:37.170 --> 52:38.150]  I didn't want any conflict.
[52:39.830 --> 52:41.030]  Pat my way in.
[52:46.950 --> 52:48.350]  Oh, Gavin went wide.
[52:49.250 --> 52:49.870]  Wide screen.
[52:49.870 --> 52:50.430]  Oh, my door!
[52:53.890 --> 52:54.910]  Oh, this may have been...
[52:54.910 --> 52:55.670]  Shit!
[52:58.110 --> 52:59.450]  Oh, you both made it.
[52:59.470 --> 53:00.530]  I can't believe that.
[53:02.570 --> 53:03.230]  Finish him!
[53:03.230 --> 53:03.930]  Finish him!
[53:07.370 --> 53:08.130]  Straight shot.
[53:09.390 --> 53:10.430]  Oh, Geoff!
[53:12.210 --> 53:13.970]  Hoisted by my own petard.
[53:14.470 --> 53:15.130]  Yes, indeed!
[53:16.130 --> 53:16.930]  Thank you, Captain!
[53:20.350 --> 53:21.870]  Been wanting a response
[53:21.870 --> 53:23.890]  from Geoff on the stream so far,
[53:23.990 --> 53:25.450]  but no luck as of yet.
[53:25.530 --> 53:26.010]  That's rough.
[53:27.170 --> 53:27.850]  Get out!
[53:28.650 --> 53:28.850]  No!
[53:33.650 --> 53:34.510]  Finish it!
[53:34.590 --> 53:35.370]  Finish it!
[53:36.030 --> 53:37.210]  Eat knobs!
[53:39.410 --> 53:40.930]  You are the only one
[53:40.930 --> 53:42.670]  who will be eating the knobs, sir!
[53:44.090 --> 53:45.430]  Kill the knobmen!
[53:46.470 --> 53:47.130]  What do you want
[53:47.130 --> 53:48.750]  a response on, Peter Storm?
[53:49.990 --> 53:51.130]  Like you winning.
[53:52.690 --> 53:53.470]  Oh, shit.
[53:53.530 --> 53:54.130]  I already won.
[53:54.570 --> 53:55.830]  Yeah, he won one.
[53:55.850 --> 53:59.270]  Oh, so it was like a verbal response?
[53:59.810 --> 54:00.870]  I assume so.
[54:00.870 --> 54:02.610]  Because somebody else said
[54:02.610 --> 54:04.430]  he responds a lot in his personal streams.
[54:08.670 --> 54:11.290]  You got taken to the knob eatery!
[54:13.310 --> 54:15.090]  That gap seemed a little bit big
[54:15.090 --> 54:15.670]  at that time.
[54:16.610 --> 54:17.050]  Oh, yeah?
[54:18.430 --> 54:20.590]  I feel like I made it before without any issues.
[54:23.130 --> 54:24.770]  I wonder what the highest level
[54:24.770 --> 54:25.710]  in GTA is.
[54:27.730 --> 54:28.510]  That's a good question.
[54:28.510 --> 54:30.150]  I feel like you guys would be closer than most.
[54:30.330 --> 54:32.650]  Andrew's 178. That's pretty high.
[54:32.810 --> 54:34.370]  I think the last thing you get
[54:34.370 --> 54:35.630]  for leveling is at 200.
[54:36.110 --> 54:37.450]  You get like a sticker or something.
[54:38.210 --> 54:40.270]  You've got a lot of that leveling
[54:40.270 --> 54:42.290]  recently doing heists
[54:42.290 --> 54:42.790]  and stuff, huh?
[54:43.730 --> 54:45.890]  Yeah, I think I was like 113
[54:45.890 --> 54:47.590]  when we started our heists.
[54:48.430 --> 54:50.590]  I think I've still only ever made
[54:50.590 --> 54:52.190]  or only ever got XP
[54:52.190 --> 54:52.770]  in videos.
[54:53.930 --> 54:54.370]  Oh.
[54:56.170 --> 54:56.830]  That's certainly
[54:56.830 --> 54:57.650]  true of me in this.
[54:57.710 --> 55:00.810]  Who was the first one to christen the office
[55:00.810 --> 55:02.310]  bathroom? I don't know.
[55:02.650 --> 55:03.490]  You don't know?
[55:04.870 --> 55:06.250]  I can take a good guess.
[55:08.130 --> 55:08.870]  I haven't been
[55:08.870 --> 55:10.670]  keeping a record of everybody's shits
[55:10.670 --> 55:12.750]  and pisses. I've done two
[55:12.750 --> 55:13.710]  pisses and that's it.
[55:14.190 --> 55:16.410]  I've done way more than that. I've peed a lot.
[55:16.430 --> 55:17.750]  I shit in there today, actually.
[55:18.850 --> 55:20.770]  Elbow deep daddy with five
[55:22.250 --> 55:24.670]  Thank you so much, elbow deep daddy.
[55:24.830 --> 55:26.870]  Thanks for digging deep in there for those five
[55:26.870 --> 55:28.790]  subs. We really appreciate it. And what are you elbow
[55:28.790 --> 55:29.250]  deep in?
[55:30.470 --> 55:31.410]  His coin purse.
[55:38.440 --> 55:39.640]  That's gotta be a way for me. Oh!
[55:39.760 --> 55:40.860]  What the? Who's that?
[55:41.560 --> 55:42.180]  Who are they?
[55:43.220 --> 55:44.480]  You got open lobby, huh?
[55:45.480 --> 55:47.920]  It's open until you're in. Then you have to close it.
[55:49.180 --> 55:49.780]  How do I
[55:49.780 --> 55:51.140]  get rid of them? They're on call.
[55:51.400 --> 55:53.140]  They're not in the session. They're just on call.
[55:54.120 --> 55:55.040]  Start without them.
[55:55.600 --> 55:57.440]  Oh! Or you could do what Jack used to do.
[55:57.520 --> 55:59.220]  Message the word leave to them.
[55:59.360 --> 55:59.860]  Oh, they're in.
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.500]  That was always one of the
[56:03.500 --> 56:05.040]  funniest things. You just text
[56:05.040 --> 56:05.540]  leave.
[56:07.220 --> 56:08.780]  Did it work? Yeah.
[56:11.260 --> 56:11.740]  Surprisingly,
[56:12.140 --> 56:12.860]  it usually worked.
[56:13.320 --> 56:15.020]  The furry living in your walls
[56:15.020 --> 56:16.360]  gifted two subs. Thank you so much.
[56:18.300 --> 56:19.120]  AdmiralLocoLex gifted
[56:19.120 --> 56:21.140]  five. Wow. I got a
[56:21.140 --> 56:23.080]  teammate, Andrew. He gifted a sub
[56:23.080 --> 56:24.340]  to Peebus. Crazy.
[56:26.100 --> 56:27.100]  You shouldn't have
[56:27.100 --> 56:29.120]  teams. They're auto-balanced. Oh, there's
[56:29.120 --> 56:30.460]  four teams set though. Fuck!
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.180]  Whose lobby is this?
[56:33.720 --> 56:34.980]  Nick's lobby. Well, it was
[56:34.980 --> 56:37.120]  Geoff's and then he left and it gave
[56:37.120 --> 56:39.040]  control to me. I didn't leave. I got
[56:39.040 --> 56:39.480]  dumped.
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.040]  This is the last game. It's fine.
[56:42.540 --> 56:44.920]  I think it was just... How could
[56:44.920 --> 56:45.700]  GTA do this?
[56:47.100 --> 56:49.020]  Oh, it is pretty close to 5-0-1.
[56:49.020 --> 56:51.000]  My money's on the random extra
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.100]  guy. Oh, definitely. We're talking
[56:53.100 --> 56:54.880]  about me being a high level and then a level
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.500]  7-24 joints.
[56:56.860 --> 56:57.700]  Oh, we're dead.
[56:59.140 --> 56:59.840]  It's fine.
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.360]  Oh, one of them left. Hell yeah.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.020]  Hell yeah. Go to hell.
[57:04.320 --> 57:06.200]  Go to hell? That's extreme. Oh, wait.
[57:06.980 --> 57:08.940]  Geoff and Andrew are on the same team. What?
[57:10.160 --> 57:10.640]  Oh.
[57:11.760 --> 57:13.000]  Alright, Gavin's there.
[57:13.860 --> 57:14.960]  Gavin, we gotta work together.
[57:15.100 --> 57:16.040]  Alright, let's work together.
[57:16.040 --> 57:18.080]  We didn't choose this.
[57:19.220 --> 57:19.440]  Right.
[57:20.880 --> 57:22.080]  Hey, bud. Hey, it's me!
[57:22.180 --> 57:23.400]  It's me! It's me! I'm pink!
[57:23.640 --> 57:24.020]  I'm pink!
[57:27.300 --> 57:28.260]  That's, uh...
[57:28.260 --> 57:30.280]  I wanna say a 13-year throwback.
[57:33.260 --> 57:33.740]  Bloody
[57:33.740 --> 57:35.300]  13-year throwback.
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.140]  Yeah, there weren't many people who got
[57:38.140 --> 57:39.240]  into our Minecraft games.
[57:39.980 --> 57:41.120]  But it happened.
[57:42.320 --> 57:42.740]  Wow.
[57:44.040 --> 57:44.760]  You invaded
[57:44.760 --> 57:45.400]  mine once.
[57:47.580 --> 57:48.160]  Did we?
[57:48.840 --> 57:50.000]  Gavin and Michael did.
[57:50.400 --> 57:52.740]  I just also happened to be in Minecraft at the same time.
[57:52.820 --> 57:54.540]  You guys opened the video by joining my game.
[57:55.420 --> 57:56.360]  Oh, was it a different world?
[57:56.780 --> 57:58.340]  We were, like, following you and stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:58.420 --> 58:00.060]  I was just trying to get achievements in it.
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.580]  And you guys were also trying to get achievements, coincidentally.
[58:02.820 --> 58:03.960]  And you joined my world briefly.
[58:05.120 --> 58:06.920]  Andrew, I didn't make it.
[58:07.580 --> 58:08.280]  Oh, no!
[58:09.080 --> 58:10.700]  That's okay. He took Gavin with you.
[58:10.700 --> 58:11.720]  I followed Geoff.
[58:13.400 --> 58:14.240]  Reverse!
[58:15.480 --> 58:16.320]  British
[58:16.320 --> 58:16.780]  winning.
[58:18.100 --> 58:18.540]  Okay.
[58:22.940 --> 58:24.540]  I'm coming for you, Nick.
[58:24.540 --> 58:26.240]  This cosmic dance of bursting
[58:26.240 --> 58:28.220]  decadence and withheld permission
[58:28.220 --> 58:29.840]  twists all of our arms collectively.
[58:30.480 --> 58:31.800]  Alright, Thesaurus.
[58:32.860 --> 58:33.600]  Alright, chill out.
[58:37.020 --> 58:37.420]  Ooh!
[58:42.350 --> 58:42.750]  Yes.
[58:44.110 --> 58:44.790]  It's okay.
[58:45.010 --> 58:46.170]  Oh, we both did the same thing.
[58:46.410 --> 58:46.950]  Look at me!
[58:47.270 --> 58:49.530]  Look at me.
[58:50.990 --> 58:51.850]  Going for the jump.
[58:52.810 --> 58:54.410]  Oh, God. I don't know if I can make it.
[58:54.730 --> 58:55.190]  Neither do I.
[58:55.890 --> 58:56.530]  Oh, that was easy.
[58:57.850 --> 58:58.650]  Easy shit.
[58:59.170 --> 59:01.050]  Neither of you front-flipped for some reason.
[59:01.930 --> 59:02.830]  I'll do that next time.
[59:03.530 --> 59:04.030]  I'll flip front.
[59:04.790 --> 59:05.190]  Boom!
[59:05.190 --> 59:05.590]  Boom!
[59:06.850 --> 59:08.670]  Took him to the hoop like slam.
[59:12.170 --> 59:13.090]  Jam.
[59:14.170 --> 59:14.950]  You wanna race?
[59:15.510 --> 59:17.510]  Race for pink slips.
[59:20.870 --> 59:21.790]  Okay.
[59:22.930 --> 59:23.650]  Let's top right.
[59:28.110 --> 59:30.970]  We should film a Philly cheese
[59:30.970 --> 59:32.310]  steakout soon.
[59:32.310 --> 59:34.010]  Yeah, we really should.
[59:34.130 --> 59:36.190]  I need a...
[59:36.190 --> 59:38.330]  I probably should talk to Tony. I need something designed
[59:38.330 --> 59:39.070]  before we do it.
[59:39.710 --> 59:40.950]  Oh, you need something engineered?
[59:41.390 --> 59:43.530]  I need something engineered, yeah. I need something arted.
[59:44.630 --> 59:46.190]  If we're gonna do it, I wanna do it properly.
[59:46.510 --> 59:48.010]  And to do it properly means a full disguise.
[59:49.430 --> 59:49.730]  Front flip!
[59:50.670 --> 59:50.930]  No!
[59:52.050 --> 59:54.770]  No, but the car might.
[59:58.710 --> 59:59.470]  Nailed it.
[59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.070]  Look at that!
[01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.550]  Perfect.
[01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:04.590]  Oh, Nick.
[01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.070]  Looking crunched.
[01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:08.670]  I'm crunchy.
[01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.410]  I haven't seen Mark the Frog today.
[01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.350]  Has anybody seen Mark the Frog?
[01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:15.090]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.870]  Make it, make it, make it, make it!
[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.390]  I got it, yeah!
[01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.670]  Nice, Nick!
[01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:20.930]  Oh!
[01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.630]  Good recovery.
[01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:27.750]  Oh, I guess he gifted a sub earlier.
[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.630]  Thank you.
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.130]  Oh, thanks, Mark the Frog!
[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.250]  Wait, what? That's over? Okay.
[01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:36.030]  Alright, let's do one more.
[01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:37.910]  Yeah, let's not find that one yet.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:38.730]  Big finale!
[01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:42.030]  You wanna fix the damn teams, though, Nick?
[01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.010]  Yeah, you fix the goddamn teams, Nick.
[01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.950]  Yeah, I'll do my bit.
[01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.610]  Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
[01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:49.670]  Six, six. Yeah, there we go.
[01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:51.610]  How do I do it?
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:52.850]  Right away? How do I do?
[01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.290]  Oh, you know what? Before anyone can join,
[01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:57.950]  I'm gonna go straight to the next section
[01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:58.970]  and close it.
[01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.470]  Alright, try and get in before he gets to the next section.
[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.650]  No, I'll kill you. Don't do it.
[01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.030]  Gdub91, thanks for the five gifted flubs.
[01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.190]  Thank you so much.
[01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.750]  We love a slub.
[01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:12.410]  Gavin Free, thank you for the five flubs.
[01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:14.510]  Five gifted flubs.
[01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:16.150]  Oh, wait, it's not my lobby!
[01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:17.530]  It's not my lobby!
[01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:18.970]  Are we in Dingle's lobby?
[01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:20.570]  We're in Dingle's lobby!
[01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.590]  You made us join Dingle?
[01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:25.650]  No, don't say...
[01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:26.950]  I did nothing.
[01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:29.370]  Nick's a Dingle joiner. Oh, no!
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:30.770]  Oh, no!
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:33.470]  Wiki Nosy?
[01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.770]  But now we got
[01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:36.610]  Wiki Nosy.
[01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.750]  What do we do?
[01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:41.330]  You're the host again, Nick.
[01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:42.610]  How did that happen?
[01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.050]  Turn team balancing off.
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:46.650]  I thought it was supposed to be...
[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.610]  Number teams four.
[01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:50.410]  Can you do five teams?
[01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:52.690]  It won't let me do...
[01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:53.010]  Oh, no!
[01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.290]  What the hell's happening?
[01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.770]  Nick invited everyone!
[01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.870]  No!
[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:00.850]  He invited everybody.
[01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:04.890]  Big Nizzo, 4DirkDunShwim...
[01:02:04.890 --> 01:02:06.390]  Oh, that other asshole's just
[01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.190]  hiding out in these people.
[01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:08.210]  Valtrex.
[01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.290]  Who's 4DirkDunShwim?
[01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.070]  I don't see that.
[01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:15.470]  Oh, here we go.
[01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:17.470]  Oh, you already have two names.
[01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:20.110]  Uh, how...
[01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:22.010]  Oh, kick! Eat shit!
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:23.470]  Are you gonna kick people one by one?
[01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:24.590]  Yeah, fuck em!
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:29.910]  Alright, we did it.
[01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:32.250]  All these people furiously loading up GTA.
[01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:34.230]  We gotta get out of here.
[01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.130]  Turn team balancing on!
[01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.850]  I just did, yeah.
[01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.370]  Before DoggySurfer477 joins.
[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.830]  Yeah, we're on!
[01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.750]  We got it, we did it.
[01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:46.450]  Ghostbaker whipped up a couple of subs.
[01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.710]  Ghostbaker baked five subs.
[01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.030]  Alright, I think we did it.
[01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.890]  5.01's coming up. Get ready.
[01:02:57.790 --> 01:02:58.510]  Get ready!
[01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:00.410]  Ready to play.
[01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.590]  And I'm ready to...
[01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.030]  Thank you.
[01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:06.190]  Why didn't it go to the right character?
[01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.290]  5.01's the best time of the week, everybody!
[01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.630]  Congratulations!
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.170]  It's Friday at 5.01 PM.
[01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.370]  This is the exact moment when
[01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.450]  we all achieve maximum joy
[01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:18.190]  because we are as far as humanly possible
[01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.530]  away from the next work week.
[01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.850]  It's all downhill from here, though.
[01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:23.970]  Yeah, every second is agony.
[01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.830]  It's true.
[01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:27.490]  We're doing some...
[01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:29.150]  We're going to the office Monday for a little bit, right?
[01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:30.390]  I think so.
[01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.190]  Film a little sausage...
[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:35.250]  Well, we'll film a sausage talk from home.
[01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:37.910]  Then we'll go in and do all the computers.
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.770]  Do the computers and
[01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:41.190]  finish Gumpler.
[01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.590]  Oh, that was it, yeah.
[01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:44.250]  We gotta re-Gump.
[01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.750]  Might do computers at the old weekend.
[01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.490]  Yeah.
[01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:50.910]  But the one with three E's,
[01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.930]  not the dude who sings.
[01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.910]  Yeah.
[01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:57.070]  His movie looks like it is going to
[01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:58.330]  bomb this weekend.
[01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:00.130]  Did I get that?
[01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:01.470]  I think I might have.
[01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:02.970]  Who won that one?
[01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:05.630]  I don't trust myself to say.
[01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:07.150]  Do you think it was you?
[01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:09.090]  No, I just thought I had
[01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:10.670]  clown in a cornfield for sure.
[01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:11.970]  So I just don't think I'm reliable.
[01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:14.350]  I might go see it this weekend.
[01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.230]  I want to see the Thunderbolts.
[01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:20.190]  Millie did not like it.
[01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:21.790]  Yep, but she went.
[01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:23.930]  She did. She supported you.
[01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:25.050]  I said thank you.
[01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:27.930]  I don't think I've seen a Marvel since the Deadpools.
[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.950]  Yeah.
[01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:32.730]  The last one I saw was the Avengers Endgame, and then I saw Deadpool.
[01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:33.810]  And that's it, I think.
[01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:35.770]  Spider-Men were good.
[01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.390]  I saw Spider-Men.
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:38.810]  Spider-Men were good.
[01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:41.470]  Spider-Men won. I didn't see two, I don't think.
[01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.950]  I think No Way Home
[01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.050]  was the best Spider-Man.
[01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:46.090]  Which one?
[01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:49.710]  Was that the one with Jake Gyllenhaal
[01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.210]  as the bad guy?
[01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.370]  No, that was far from home.
[01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:55.830]  No Way Home was the one with all the Spider-Men
[01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:56.910]  who came back.
[01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.210]  I didn't see that one.
[01:04:59.250 --> 01:04:59.790]  It was a good one.
[01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:01.950]  I can't wait for you all to see Fantastic
[01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.710]  Four. You're all going to
[01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.910]  definitely see it. You all got to go see it.
[01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:07.430]  Ah, you almost killed me!
[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:08.870]  I know!
[01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:12.710]  I'm going to go out the wall.
[01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.710]  Upside down is not the...
[01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:16.270]  Oh shit!
[01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:19.710]  Get me off the ceiling!
[01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:20.750]  Gavin!
[01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.210]  Oh, Gavin, here he comes!
[01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:24.850]  Oh, dude!
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.210]  He finished.
[01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.230]  I just couldn't get back
[01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.710]  to my wheels.
[01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:30.850]  Gavin happens to be the best of us.
[01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:32.870]  You'll get him next time, champ.
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.310]  Yeah, you'll get yourself next time.
[01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:38.230]  I'm going to fucking do
[01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.890]  this jump. What am I, crazy?
[01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:40.990]  Whoa!
[01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.170]  Nicko's shooting through.
[01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.010]  Mind the gap!
[01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.230]  Well, that just seemed unnecessary.
[01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:49.790]  Did it?
[01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:50.650]  I was trying to kill you.
[01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.710]  Yeah, that's why I felt it was unnecessary.
[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.030]  Why?
[01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:56.370]  Because I like to be alive.
[01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:58.750]  I'd rather not be dead.
[01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:00.670]  Did anybody ever see
[01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:02.330]  Trainspotting 2? I never saw that either.
[01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.470]  Is it good? No. It's fine.
[01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:05.430]  It has a good opener.
[01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.250]  I don't remember...
[01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:11.430]  Oh!
[01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:13.890]  Oh my god!
[01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:16.030]  Wow, thank you.
[01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.370]  What happened?
[01:06:18.810 --> 01:06:20.850]  I was still holding the reverse button.
[01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.930]  Nick, how much for you to change your name
[01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:27.810]  to Schlublord?
[01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:31.610]  How much for you?
[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:33.410]  $400.
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:37.010]  I'll pay it. How much to change your name
[01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:38.170]  legally to Milfeet?
[01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.590]  Wait, we're talking about Gamertag, right, Gavin?
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.970]  Not my name. No, your legal name.
[01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:44.430]  Oh, fuck. A million dollars.
[01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:46.990]  A million? You already agreed to do it
[01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.290]  for $400. No!
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.830]  Which is, by the way, barely going to cover
[01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:51.970]  the court costs.
[01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:52.970]  How?
[01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.490]  Well, I did it
[01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:57.550]  15 years ago, but it was
[01:06:58.410 --> 01:07:00.410]  about $170 at the time.
[01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.030]  I imagine it's gone up, thanks to
[01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:02.610]  the tariffs.
[01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:06.070]  It's your name.
[01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:07.050]  It should be free.
[01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.030]  Yeah, the government's gotta get their
[01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.150]  cut, man. Do they need your most up-to-date
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.950]  name? No.
[01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:16.110]  You gotta go in front of a judge, and the judge
[01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:17.970]  has gotta go, I'm sorry, you wanna change your
[01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:19.990]  middle name to what? And you gotta go laser,
[01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:21.930]  and they go, are you hiding from
[01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.550]  debt collectors? And you gotta go, no.
[01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:24.990]  And then they're like,
[01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:27.890]  do you think that changing your middle name to,
[01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.950]  looks at the paper, laser with a Z
[01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:32.070]  is going to positively impact
[01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:34.230]  your life in some way? And you gotta go, yes, I do.
[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:36.190]  Woo! No, that's
[01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:37.750]  a mistake! Don't do it!
[01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.810]  Oh! Well, Henry
[01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:40.490]  Dillman's a good one.
[01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:42.330]  It's a classic.
[01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:45.690]  You think that was, uh... Oh, shit!
[01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.010]  Oh, shit! Nick, get on
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.070]  your wheels, Nick! Come back, Nick!
[01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:51.090]  Gavin!
[01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:52.430]  Gavin!
[01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:57.970]  Gavin, what the fuck?
[01:07:57.970 --> 01:07:58.190]  Gavin, what the fuck
[01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.930]  were you doing? I was trying to kill
[01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:00.310]  Nick.
[01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:04.930]  Uh-oh.
[01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:07.390]  Uh-oh.
[01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:09.590]  That's a movie I wanna watch.
[01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.910]  Two hours of Uma Thurman just trying to kill Nick.
[01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:13.190]  What?
[01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:15.610]  Kill Nick. Okay.
[01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:18.050]  See, it's
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.890]  not so much fun when someone's trying to get you.
[01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:21.350]  Not so much fun.
[01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.730]  You know what? It all checks out now that you mentioned it.
[01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:25.990]  You know, that's interesting
[01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.050]  because Uma Thurman shows her toes a lot
[01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:29.910]  in that movie. It's probably a big one for you already.
[01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:31.930]  I never thought about that.
[01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.190]  Nick, how much
[01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.030]  for your name to be Dillman Dillback?
[01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:41.630]  Probably the same, honestly. A million?
[01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:44.270]  So you wouldn't do it for like $450,000?
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.270]  I'd think about it
[01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.210]  for $450,000.
[01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:50.110]  Yeah, just call Dillman Dillback. It's fine.
[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:54.270]  They can call me Dilly Bar for short.
[01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.870]  Go ahead and make a gift.
[01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.610]  What's up to Jeremy?
[01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.170]  Wow! He's gonna
[01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:00.770]  watch this.
[01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:03.970]  That's nice.
[01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.210]  That is nice. I want good things for Jeremy
[01:09:06.210 --> 01:09:07.290]  including free subs.
[01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:09.510]  Maybe he can enjoy our content.
[01:09:12.850 --> 01:09:13.890]  Remember all the times
[01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.270]  that he did the exact same things
[01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:17.270]  with us but better?
[01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:24.570]  I miss Jeremy.
[01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:26.450]  We had a meeting about
[01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.210]  when he announced
[01:09:29.210 --> 01:09:29.790]  he was leaving.
[01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:32.610]  And I could just tell by the tone of the Discord
[01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:34.910]  that someone was leaving.
[01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.270]  And Trevor goes,
[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:39.490]  Alright, I'll hand it over to you.
[01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:40.390]  And I just went,
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.050]  Son of a bitch!
[01:09:43.690 --> 01:09:44.330]  Prick!
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.660]  It was a hard loss to take.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.060]  Jeremy's one of
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.140]  everybody who meets him's
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.120]  favorite people.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.520]  Invisible genitals!
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.020]  Five gifted subs.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.660]  I should say the second half.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:08.680]  Invisible genitals.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.680]  Genitals, yeah.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.800]  He's got an invisible genital
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.700]  that he can control.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.480]  Genitals!
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:27.900]  Alright.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.000]  This has gone on for too long.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.920]  I don't like the way you said that.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.200]  He really
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.440]  doesn't understand edging.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.920]  I got shit to do!
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.960]  It's been a week of nobody
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.780]  associated with regulation
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.840]  feeling well, now that I think about it.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.520]  Today it was me and Eric.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.260]  Yesterday it was Gavin and Nick.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.640]  Andrew, how are you holding up? I'm great.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.100]  Don't eat
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.160]  a lot of anything weird.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.140]  No! I pulled my
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:07.940]  phone up.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:10.960]  I panicked
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.700]  and pulled my phone.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.180]  Wait, the in-game phone?
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.080]  Yeah, the in-game. No, I picked up
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.640]  my physical phone and I went, hello!
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:19.860]  And screamed in it.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:25.700]  That felt good.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.800]  This is our round, Gavin.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.300]  Geoff and Ray were team salt and vinegar.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:31.660]  Thank you.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.940]  Answering questions in the chat.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.640]  Andrew, what's your
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.240]  ankle integrity at? 100%?
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:38.840]  100%
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:39.500]  Oh!
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.740]  Is there anything on your body that's 100% right now, Gavin?
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.320]  Uh...
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:46.780]  Ooh.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.880]  Elobes? Pretty solid?
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.380]  Oh yeah? Why don't you tug him for a second?
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.420]  Dude, don't tug your elobes.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.580]  You wanna squeeze the earlobe hearts?
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.240]  We're trying to edge, Gavin, not finish him.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.280]  You're an earlobe guy, Gavin?
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.420]  Oh, you know he is.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.360]  He's an earlobe guy like you're a foot guy.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:06.780]  I'm a milf guy.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.760]  No, guys,
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.340]  it's not the feet, it's the milfs.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.300]  Ooh!
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.140]  Milfs.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.060]  Is it one of those words that becomes
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.600]  a V, like leaf?
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.720]  Like it becomes V in plural? Milfs?
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.540]  What does the V stand for?
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.280]  Very good point.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.920]  I guess you can't
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.520]  V pluralize an acronym.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.520]  Mothers, I love to vary...
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.180]  Ooh, never mind.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:35.940]  I don't know.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:36.740]  Oh!
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.360]  Oh!
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.380]  My hood's going up,
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.540]  my door's flying around.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:45.840]  Oh!
[01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:47.560]  Oh!
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.220]  Geoff's car is huge.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:52.600]  Thank you.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.180]  Holy shit!
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.040]  Hey, you're welcome.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.600]  Is this the path to
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.460]  over there? Oh, shit.
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:04.860]  No!
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:06.740]  Christ!
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.500]  Dude, you almost took me out.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.140]  Oh, that was close, Geoff!
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.400]  Land!
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.760]  Where are they?
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.200]  Look out!
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.880]  Get him!
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.160]  No!
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.940]  No! Get him!
[01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.010]  I was late there because
[01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.190]  I was hanging two wheels over the edge
[01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.630]  of the hole for like half that timer.
[01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.170]  That was such
[01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:34.490]  a merciless killing. Get him!
[01:13:37.090 --> 01:13:37.570]  Whoa.
[01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:40.070]  Oh, shit!
[01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:41.550]  Gotta watch the clock!
[01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.850]  Clock watch.
[01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:48.290]  Chaotically chaotic
[01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.310]  chaotic
[01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.430]  chaotic
[01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.250]  chaotic
[01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:55.590]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:57.450]  Yeah, thank you!
[01:13:58.910 --> 01:14:00.150]  Autolyte colostomy bag.
[01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:01.590]  Oh, goodness.
[01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:03.050]  Oh, dear.
[01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:05.950]  I don't want to have one of those, but it's probably
[01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:07.070]  in my future at some point.
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.990]  Is that for poop?
[01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:12.210]  It's the same
[01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:14.290]  shit that's in your body, it's just outside your body
[01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:14.850]  in a bag.
[01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.090]  Saves a step.
[01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:17.070]  It does.
[01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:19.750]  And you can accessorize it.
[01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.170]  Get a little Louis Vuitton, put a LeBooBoo on it.
[01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.510]  LeBooBoo.
[01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.950]  LeBooBoo.
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.960]  You crazy kids over there.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.660]  I followed it.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.260]  We're having the time of our lives.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:40.840]  Oh, no!
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:42.980]  Goddamn, dude.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.820]  I almost
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.560]  fucked myself pretty hard there.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.120]  Running out of time, Gavin.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:04.900]  Boy, as I'm about
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.000]  to win this, I realize that the stream is winding
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.980]  down, and I just wanted to say a special
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.960]  thank you to everybody who tuned in
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.280]  today and supported us.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.220]  With the subs, or with your eyeballs,
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.080]  or you just told somebody about it,
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.860]  or just enjoyed the content, we really do
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.880]  appreciate you hanging out with us every
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.200]  Friday till the best time of the week, Friday 5.01pm,
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.040]  which is now over.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.780]  Now we're taking down to the worst time of the week, which is
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.700]  Monday at 9am.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.980]  Anyway, it means a whole hell of a lot
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.740]  to us that you're hanging out with us, and that you
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.700]  are supporting us, and we really do
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.760]  appreciate it. It's nice to see a similar
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.740]  crew every week as well. It really is, too.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.780]  It feels like friends. Every time
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.900]  I see a Mark the Frog or a Pigeon Studios Pete
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.640]  or any of a bunch of people,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.560]  I get really excited.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.620]  Oh, shit.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.360]  The regulation family grows.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.900]  You guys made a triangle.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:55.840]  That was impressive.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.720]  Also, if you're new-ish here because you
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.660]  caught an Achievement Hunter video and you
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.620]  forgot Gavin and I existed, and then you saw that video
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:03.940]  and you're like, holy shit, they're not dead?
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.740]  I'll tune in for a little bit. Extra special
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.420]  thanks to you.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.620]  How did that just tap you a foot
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.980]  and I went sailing nine meters?
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:20.600]  Because I floored it, dude. I got out of there.
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.420]  Alright,
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.520]  for all the marbles
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.320]  in the 501 win
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.340]  at 514,
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.540]  I'm Marble Nick.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.460]  I'm Marble Nick.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.680]  GF, I'm
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.360]  Marble Nick.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.340]  And if you've never been on the Patreon, it'd be
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.680]  a good time to maybe do it for
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.680]  a month or so and see all the shit we put up last
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.620]  year. It was a lot of stuff.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.400]  What was it, Andrew? We were
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.120]  contractually obligated to put up
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:50.600]  230
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.740]  pieces of content, but we put up
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.460]  350 or something.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.260]  Damn it!
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.040]  We're those suck-ups
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.600]  at school who do extra credit work
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.880]  even though they already have an A.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.860]  We did like a hundred and ten
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.160]  pieces of extra credit or something over there.
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:13.240]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.060]  What a great day. Can't end on a better note
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.060]  than that. A perfect stream.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.380]  This was so much fun.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.120]  This was a really good Friday from the beginning to the end.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.500]  The bad part was the donuts,
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.460]  but we survived, some of us.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.840]  What's Nick over there owing about?
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.540]  Uh...
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:32.460]  nothing.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.140]  Everything's fine.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.920]  Didn't almost just vomit.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:37.560]  No!
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.560]  It was a surprise burp.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.300]  It was just a burp vomit.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.400]  Man, you guys got hit.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.880]  I want to know what it was that took you guys out.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.520]  Because we all had the same hot dogs.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:51.900]  Did you guys
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.000]  have anything else?
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.780]  Gotta tune into the podcast to find out.
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.740]  Oh!
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.460]  What a tease!
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.350]  I thought there was more.
[01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.250]  Where can you find it?
[01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.210]  Everywhere!
[01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:09.730]  Anywhere podcasts are found!
[01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:11.610]  On the airwaves, Nick.
[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:13.690]  And on our Patreon at
[01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:15.970]  regulatetreon.com
[01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.970]  Thanks to everybody who subbed.
[01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.890]  Thanks to Jeremy Dooley
[01:18:19.890 --> 01:18:22.590]  who came in and shut down a bunch.
[01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.190]  Thanks Jeremy!
[01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:25.990]  The hell of a guy.
[01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:27.570]  Great guy.
[01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:28.530]  Love Jeremy.
[01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.350]  Bye everyone!
[01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.810]  See you next week!
