[00:00.000 --> 00:07.580]  Hi everybody, happy Friday. Best day of the week. We're working up towards the best time of the week. 5-0-1. Let's see pissed rats in the chat.
[00:08.580 --> 00:16.560]  5-0-1. Nick, your game is snowing. Why is your game still snowing? No idea. This ended. I have no idea. This ended like a week ago.
[00:16.740 --> 00:25.160]  You guys asked me if I just had like left my Xbox on. Nope. Turned it off. Unplugged it. Did everything. Still in the snow. We're having a good time.
[00:25.900 --> 00:34.340]  We were recording something recently and the weather doesn't really come up in the game and then Nick brought up that it was snowing.
[00:34.440 --> 00:43.840]  And it blew our minds because that event had ended I think two days prior at that point and we're at a full week and you still are stuck in snow.
[00:45.640 --> 00:51.280]  It's going to be quite the juxtaposition when that video comes out. Kind of like how you were at night and we were in day or vice versa.
[00:52.580 --> 00:59.300]  Yeah, that's great. But Nick, we have an important mission today. What are we doing? You and I. Yeah, what are we up to?
[00:59.320 --> 01:08.840]  We're team No Bad Ideas. According to team tape, Gavin and Eric, there may be some bad ideas. Not to us. No bad ideas.
[01:09.840 --> 01:17.800]  And you've been kind of our designated pilot across all of the heists we have done. And hey, personally, I think you've done great.
[01:17.800 --> 01:25.700]  I'm not going to say who. There may have been some other comments of not always the best performance, especially with windmills.
[01:26.120 --> 01:34.420]  A little too attracted to them. Weird. That didn't occur to me. Listen, it didn't occur to me either. It's just some of the whispers in the back.
[01:34.620 --> 01:44.980]  Weird. But, you know, those fuckers are not here. They're gone. So while they're away, I figured no better time for us to get flight certified.
[01:45.780 --> 01:52.280]  So next time there's any complaining, it's on them. Excellent. We're ready. So we're going to flight school.
[01:52.640 --> 01:59.160]  We are going to flight school, and we are going to go through these until you get gold on all of them. Oh, God.
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.360]  There's only like eight, and I assume we will not be able to finish this within this stream, but maybe we will.
[02:07.180 --> 02:14.520]  Oh, no. Find out how to do an outside loop. Whoa! Oh, he called me a shitheel.
[02:15.820 --> 02:21.600]  Yeah, that's what they do to the military, I believe. I instantly skip. It's always the move.
[02:21.660 --> 02:24.900]  Yeah, it's the move. I was just seeing if there was anything relevant there.
[02:24.900 --> 02:30.180]  I'm going to army proof you duly. Fly your death jet toward the marker and gain altitude.
[02:30.680 --> 02:41.980]  You guys really don't like my flying? I think the chopper is my weakness. I love your flying.
[02:43.880 --> 02:55.690]  I'd say obstacles generally maybe don't like it. Okay, did I do it? I don't think you did. How not?
[02:55.690 --> 03:03.350]  You have to be very specific. What? I think you kind of did it at an angle, like a slight angle.
[03:03.430 --> 03:05.390]  Oh, am I supposed to do it? It did not count. Okay.
[03:06.310 --> 03:11.490]  So you can see there's a looping bar in the bottom right. You are currently not generating any...
[03:11.490 --> 03:14.050]  I don't understand. What am I supposed to do? Oh, maybe I should watch the video.
[03:17.610 --> 03:23.030]  Yeah, there was a tutorial you could just skip through. But, now see, that's some good flying.
[03:23.030 --> 03:26.050]  Yeah, see? That is some maverick shit. Let's see what we do here.
[03:28.690 --> 03:32.870]  I have no idea. Okay, well. Alright, let's see what he says.
[03:32.910 --> 03:34.750]  Oh, thank you so much TheAngryPirate for subscribing.
[03:36.350 --> 03:41.070]  Approve. Okay, fly your death jet toward the marker and gain altitude. Alright, doing that.
[03:45.020 --> 03:50.780]  Oh, maybe you didn't have the altitude. But it's... am I supposed to go through that or go higher?
[03:54.140 --> 03:55.780]  Uh... I'd say go through that.
[03:56.060 --> 03:58.820]  Flight stick forward and... oh, level up the plane. Okay.
[03:59.060 --> 04:01.300]  Okay. Go for it. Execute. Okay.
[04:02.900 --> 04:05.200]  No, you're twisting, Nick. You're twisting. What?
[04:05.200 --> 04:08.620]  A little bit of a twist there. Oh, I see. It wants me to go back the other way.
[04:08.780 --> 04:09.580]  You gotta keep it straight. I see, I see, I see.
[04:11.200 --> 04:12.120]  Straight? Ah.
[04:12.120 --> 04:12.400]  Yeah.
[04:17.700 --> 04:21.500]  Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright.
[04:22.520 --> 04:26.800]  You got this. I see that it's telling me to do forward on the stick.
[04:26.980 --> 04:30.300]  I was pulling back on the stick. Yeah, well...
[04:30.300 --> 04:33.440]  You're gonna wanna pull back to loop, but...
[04:33.440 --> 04:35.080]  What? But it says... wait, hold on.
[04:35.940 --> 04:37.960]  But the stick showed up on it.
[04:39.940 --> 04:41.420]  Am I, uh... okay.
[04:41.560 --> 04:46.060]  Keep your aircraft straight is, I think, the main thing you need to do.
[04:48.320 --> 04:49.820]  Alright. There you go.
[04:51.480 --> 04:55.000]  Okay. Well, that's... you know, that's one way to do a loop.
[04:55.120 --> 04:57.500]  That's what it says. It says push forward. Okay.
[04:57.880 --> 04:58.600]  It says push forward.
[05:01.220 --> 05:02.300]  Right? Am I wrong?
[05:02.620 --> 05:04.220]  Listen, I'm not saying you're wrong. I wasn't reading.
[05:04.320 --> 05:07.260]  Oh, I... I just... when I think of a loop, I never think of going that way.
[05:08.720 --> 05:10.360]  What am I doing here? Especially that low to the ground.
[05:11.060 --> 05:11.900]  What am I doing here?
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.040]  Outside loop.
[05:16.580 --> 05:19.400]  Oh. What does that mean? I don't know what that means.
[05:19.440 --> 05:21.700]  I don't know because you did the same loop both times.
[05:22.220 --> 05:25.660]  Hey, we did it! Look, I got gold! I got gold! I got gold!
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.300]  You're going to the next lesson!
[05:27.620 --> 05:30.240]  Oh! What did I learn from doing that?
[05:31.260 --> 05:35.020]  I... well, I think that's on you. I think that's a thing you would answer.
[05:36.060 --> 05:37.680]  I... hold stick forward. Good?
[05:38.780 --> 05:40.500]  Hey, thanks for watching, everybody.
[05:41.960 --> 05:43.660]  Yeah, you aced it. Test done.
[05:44.880 --> 05:48.040]  Okay. Oh, engine failure. Land the Mildred after an engine failure.
[05:48.080 --> 05:51.060]  Oh, this is... this is my jam. This is what I need, Andrew. This is the kind of thing...
[05:51.060 --> 05:52.840]  In a heist, this will be very...
[05:52.840 --> 05:54.020]  This will be very, very...
[05:54.020 --> 05:55.940]  Our engines are failing all the time.
[05:56.440 --> 06:01.580]  Yes, that infamous line. I seem to be crashing.
[06:03.760 --> 06:06.380]  Alright. So, you flew into some...
[06:06.380 --> 06:09.480]  Okay. The engine's cut. You're going to glide down for a landing.
[06:11.280 --> 06:11.720]  It's like flight.
[06:12.000 --> 06:12.960]  Oh, sweet! Look at this!
[06:14.040 --> 06:15.500]  Like Denzel Washington right now.
[06:15.520 --> 06:18.080]  How do I bring out the wheels?
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.080]  Click left stick.
[06:20.440 --> 06:21.580]  Left stick.
[06:22.780 --> 06:24.600]  X... wait, where are they? There they are.
[06:31.220 --> 06:32.900]  Uh... why did he enter the wrong way?
[06:34.680 --> 06:36.040]  Okay. Here we go. Let's do this.
[06:36.120 --> 06:37.240]  Okay. There are the towers.
[06:37.640 --> 06:38.240]  Coming in.
[06:39.560 --> 06:40.360]  Coming in.
[06:41.060 --> 06:41.820]  Coming in.
[06:43.780 --> 06:47.140]  Well, I think the challenge part, Nick, is you want to land at the...
[06:49.140 --> 06:49.540]  Uh...
[06:49.540 --> 06:56.060]  But wouldn't the ideal thing to be to land with as much runway as possible so that you don't...
[06:56.060 --> 06:56.460]  Crash?
[06:57.900 --> 07:01.440]  Uh, I don't know if the goal when they land is to have the most runway possible.
[07:01.700 --> 07:02.260]  So am I.
[07:02.340 --> 07:03.380]  They definitely need enough.
[07:03.380 --> 07:06.380]  Wait, what? But if it's a crash landing...
[07:07.680 --> 07:10.800]  Well, listen, as far as crash landings go, I would call this great.
[07:10.840 --> 07:12.260]  I would call this a great success.
[07:13.940 --> 07:15.160]  You're a son of a bitch, game!
[07:15.180 --> 07:16.560]  That fire truck is getting in your business.
[07:18.100 --> 07:18.420]  Okay.
[07:19.860 --> 07:22.560]  Well, you passed it, but I don't think that was bronze.
[07:23.580 --> 07:24.220]  Okay, well...
[07:24.220 --> 07:25.000]  You can do better than that.
[07:25.060 --> 07:26.400]  I can do way better than that.
[07:26.460 --> 07:30.340]  Alright, well, now that I know, honestly, I was giving myself a lot of leeway for the landing.
[07:31.260 --> 07:31.580]  Oh, yeah.
[07:31.580 --> 07:37.940]  A lot of this is just you, like, you do it once and you get a feel for it and then you lock yourself in.
[07:38.200 --> 07:38.980]  Here we go.
[07:39.160 --> 07:39.960]  So you think this will take...
[07:39.960 --> 07:40.820]  We gotta go back!
[07:40.920 --> 07:41.640]  We have to go back.
[07:42.300 --> 07:43.580]  Jayden, we have to go back!
[07:44.120 --> 07:45.060]  What a reveal.
[07:49.060 --> 07:50.880]  That was the first Flash Forward, wasn't it?
[07:51.580 --> 07:52.800]  Was it? I don't remember.
[07:52.820 --> 07:53.360]  Yeah, it had to have been.
[07:54.100 --> 07:56.040]  Because it was like, it was the first episode of that season.
[07:57.640 --> 08:00.380]  Uh, we just assumed it was a Jack Dad issue.
[08:01.780 --> 08:02.060]  Always.
[08:02.520 --> 08:03.040]  Oh, yeah.
[08:05.560 --> 08:09.760]  And, uh, and then at the end of the episode, it was like, oh, what the hell is Kate doing there?
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.400]  How would he know Kate before the island?
[08:12.180 --> 08:13.540]  Oh, and then he's like, we have to go back.
[08:16.580 --> 08:17.340]  This is it.
[08:17.840 --> 08:18.540]  Coming in.
[08:18.860 --> 08:19.000]  Uh-oh.
[08:19.260 --> 08:20.240]  Yeah, you're locked in.
[08:20.400 --> 08:20.820]  Locked in.
[08:23.420 --> 08:24.000]  Locked in.
[08:26.160 --> 08:27.020]  Locked in, alright.
[08:27.020 --> 08:32.780]  It makes me so happy to see people join this stream and just immediately ask, why do you still have snow?
[08:33.280 --> 08:34.020]  Oh, yeah, well...
[08:35.500 --> 08:36.600]  It's a great question.
[08:36.680 --> 08:37.920]  It's a great question.
[08:39.120 --> 08:39.920]  Oh, come on!
[08:41.020 --> 08:42.160]  Ooh, Nick!
[08:42.300 --> 08:43.920]  Oh, it's alright, it's alright, we got it!
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.780]  Brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes!
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.360]  Oh, was I supposed to... oh.
[08:49.500 --> 08:49.900]  Whoops.
[08:50.820 --> 08:53.680]  Okay, alright, I got it now. I know. Hey.
[08:55.560 --> 08:56.300]  But you see what I'm saying?
[08:56.300 --> 09:01.600]  I wanted to be further up the runway than this far along the runway.
[09:01.740 --> 09:03.380]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[09:04.740 --> 09:06.140]  Was that further than the...
[09:06.140 --> 09:06.860]  Oh, yeah, I was way further.
[09:06.860 --> 09:07.840]  Oh, so much further.
[09:07.960 --> 09:08.280]  Way further.
[09:10.040 --> 09:10.840]  Way further.
[09:11.080 --> 09:16.280]  You're zoning it in, though. You went past it, you went before it, now...
[09:16.280 --> 09:17.620]  Now you'll hit dead in the middle.
[09:18.220 --> 09:20.000]  Also, can I not... I can't brake, can I?
[09:20.440 --> 09:21.520]  Yeah, left trigger.
[09:21.780 --> 09:23.300]  No, but I mean, if the engine's dead...
[09:24.860 --> 09:25.260]  Oh.
[09:26.920 --> 09:27.740]  Is there...
[09:29.440 --> 09:30.440]  Let us know!
[09:30.620 --> 09:31.960]  Is there a handbrake on planes?
[09:32.600 --> 09:32.780]  No.
[09:34.280 --> 09:36.300]  What else? I was using the main...
[09:37.020 --> 09:42.540]  Oh, yeah, because there's not, because that just turns the... the rudders, right?
[09:43.860 --> 09:45.480]  Left and right bumper just... yeah.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.400]  Is there really no, like, mechanical way for them to, like, stall the...
[09:52.400 --> 09:55.460]  I mean, I imagine in real life...
[09:55.460 --> 09:56.340]  Yeah.
[09:57.420 --> 10:00.160]  There's probably some, like, a manual brake.
[10:02.240 --> 10:02.500]  Okay.
[10:02.820 --> 10:03.020]  Okay.
[10:04.480 --> 10:05.640]  Pulling that landing gear.
[10:06.080 --> 10:06.600]  Here we go.
[10:07.080 --> 10:07.740]  Coming in.
[10:08.360 --> 10:08.800]  Okay.
[10:08.980 --> 10:10.040]  Oh, I like that.
[10:10.860 --> 10:11.260]  It's alright.
[10:11.360 --> 10:13.140]  Oh, you're going down really early.
[10:14.480 --> 10:14.960]  Okay.
[10:15.100 --> 10:16.400]  Well, this almost worked the first time.
[10:16.900 --> 10:17.240]  Sure.
[10:18.080 --> 10:18.820]  Let's see.
[10:19.120 --> 10:19.740]  You're letting it drift.
[10:19.760 --> 10:22.440]  Keep roll, roll, drift, drift, roll, roll, baby.
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.040]  Roll, baby.
[10:23.040 --> 10:23.560]  Come on.
[10:23.560 --> 10:24.600]  Roll, roll.
[10:24.980 --> 10:25.360]  Keep going.
[10:25.620 --> 10:26.140]  Out of the way.
[10:26.480 --> 10:26.960]  Get out of the way.
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.000]  Oh, we're not going to get close.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.060]  I think it might be a little short.
[10:31.560 --> 10:32.860]  I guess long.
[10:33.080 --> 10:34.840]  I guess not short enough.
[10:35.920 --> 10:36.160]  Okay.
[10:39.720 --> 10:40.960]  These firetrucks, once again.
[10:43.020 --> 10:44.040]  I mean, I...
[10:44.040 --> 10:48.200]  I still think, you know, if it were me, I'd be pretty happy with that landing.
[10:48.300 --> 10:49.000]  I would, yeah.
[10:49.160 --> 10:52.140]  If I was a passenger, I'd be giving you a platinum medal.
[10:52.180 --> 10:52.700]  Hell yeah, dude.
[10:52.720 --> 10:53.280]  Fucking bronze.
[10:53.280 --> 10:53.540]  Yeah.
[10:55.160 --> 11:03.180]  Can you imagine the fucking audacity of a passenger to be like, well, you didn't crash land close to my gate, so bronze medal.
[11:03.740 --> 11:04.480]  Based on people?
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.400]  I have a connector.
[11:05.840 --> 11:07.400]  I can imagine the audacity of that.
[11:07.540 --> 11:08.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[11:08.420 --> 11:09.540]  People are the worst sometimes.
[11:10.620 --> 11:11.300]  All right, let's try this again.
[11:13.400 --> 11:16.500]  Is the airport the place that brings out the worst in people?
[11:17.480 --> 11:19.120]  On like a consistent basis?
[11:19.820 --> 11:21.540]  Oh, that's a good question.
[11:21.540 --> 11:22.940]  You're like having no patience.
[11:23.300 --> 11:24.840]  That or the grocery store, right?
[11:26.500 --> 11:30.220]  Are you beefing with people in the grocery store? I guess like the parking lot of the grocery store.
[11:30.560 --> 11:31.820]  Unintentionally so, I think.
[11:32.920 --> 11:43.040]  You know, some people just like park in the middle of the aisle with their cart or they don't pay attention and like there's people like that you're holding up behind you.
[11:43.180 --> 11:44.000]  You know, that kind of thing.
[11:44.420 --> 11:44.860]  True.
[11:46.100 --> 11:50.840]  Or, you know, like kind of like gazing at their phone while they're parked in front of them.
[11:50.840 --> 11:52.940]  Say like a certain freezer section or whatever.
[11:53.360 --> 11:53.960]  Uh-huh.
[11:54.180 --> 11:54.920]  Okay, here we go.
[11:55.240 --> 11:55.680]  Okay.
[11:55.940 --> 11:56.320]  Okay.
[11:56.900 --> 11:57.640]  Lock it in.
[11:57.820 --> 11:58.400]  Here we go.
[11:58.880 --> 11:59.400]  This is it.
[11:59.560 --> 12:00.380]  This is it right here.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.920]  You're landing way later, which I like.
[12:03.160 --> 12:03.640]  Here we go.
[12:03.920 --> 12:05.400]  Oh, Nick, this looks really good.
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.200]  Come on.
[12:06.440 --> 12:07.040]  Keep drifting.
[12:07.360 --> 12:07.540]  Slow.
[12:07.540 --> 12:08.160]  Keep going.
[12:08.700 --> 12:09.060]  Pull.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.000]  Oh.
[12:10.080 --> 12:10.300]  Pull.
[12:12.440 --> 12:12.880]  Oh.
[12:14.360 --> 12:14.800]  No.
[12:15.360 --> 12:15.900]  How much?
[12:16.100 --> 12:16.380]  Oh.
[12:16.480 --> 12:16.740]  Oh, wait.
[12:16.780 --> 12:17.500]  Maybe it'll give it to me.
[12:18.620 --> 12:19.840]  Yeah, I don't know what gold is.
[12:19.840 --> 12:21.660]  God damn it!
[12:22.300 --> 12:23.820]  It's in the thing.
[12:25.580 --> 12:28.580]  Somebody said that grocery stores are a PvP-enabled zone.
[12:28.740 --> 12:29.120]  It's true.
[12:30.740 --> 12:31.820]  But yeah, I think you're right.
[12:31.880 --> 12:33.060]  The airport...
[12:33.060 --> 12:33.760]  And it's not even...
[12:33.760 --> 12:34.840]  It's not just the people...
[12:35.460 --> 12:40.080]  Like, obviously, some people have issues with TSA or whatever or, you know, whatever else.
[12:40.340 --> 12:40.780]  Employee there.
[12:41.460 --> 12:45.120]  The people just going through are just so...
[12:45.120 --> 12:46.260]  Well, everybody's sick, right?
[12:46.340 --> 12:47.660]  They're like sick and tired of waiting.
[12:47.840 --> 12:48.020]  Yeah.
[12:48.020 --> 12:48.720]  You get through.
[12:48.720 --> 12:50.020]  You have to go sit in a confined space.
[12:50.120 --> 12:51.040]  Everyone's stressed.
[12:51.240 --> 12:51.340]  Ah.
[12:52.360 --> 12:53.460]  It's all time-based.
[12:53.640 --> 12:54.960]  It's the one thing where you're really...
[12:54.960 --> 12:57.720]  Aside from a movie, which doesn't matter if you're late to...
[12:59.200 --> 12:59.580]  Uh...
[12:59.580 --> 13:01.960]  It's, like, so time-based that it can totally screw you.
[13:03.220 --> 13:05.820]  That's the financial investment of, like...
[13:05.820 --> 13:08.740]  If I bought a ticket to a movie and I don't make it, I can...
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.240]  That's fine.
[13:09.900 --> 13:10.220]  Yeah.
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.900]  If I need to try to catch a flight that I no longer am gonna be able to get on...
[13:14.900 --> 13:18.200]  That is both a financial and just timing stress and...
[13:18.200 --> 13:19.420]  Well, then on top of it, too.
[13:19.540 --> 13:21.900]  It's like, am I stuck here for the night kind of thing?
[13:22.040 --> 13:22.560]  Am I...
[13:22.940 --> 13:23.680]  It's a...
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.200]  It's a huge...
[13:26.220 --> 13:26.900]  Especially for...
[13:26.900 --> 13:27.000]  Yeah.
[13:27.080 --> 13:30.960]  Like, if you're going somewhere from home and a flight is canceled or whatever last second...
[13:30.960 --> 13:31.060]  Mm-hmm.
[13:31.060 --> 13:33.280]  It's like, at least you're in your city...
[13:33.280 --> 13:34.300]  Or you're close to home.
[13:35.220 --> 13:35.620]  Uh...
[13:36.420 --> 13:37.660]  I find that...
[13:37.660 --> 13:39.260]  I might be coming in too...
[13:39.260 --> 13:40.240]  Oh, this might work.
[13:41.260 --> 13:42.440]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be close.
[13:42.700 --> 13:43.100]  It's gonna be close.
[13:43.100 --> 13:46.360]  Every time you're in this position, it makes me think of curling.
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.280]  Like, I just wanna get in front of the plane and just...
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.000]  Try to swipe.
[13:50.440 --> 13:53.640]  Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[13:54.500 --> 13:55.940]  I think I'm in it. I think I got it.
[13:56.020 --> 13:56.380]  Yeah!
[13:57.000 --> 13:57.360]  What?!
[13:58.540 --> 13:59.700]  He gave me a silver star.
[14:01.140 --> 14:03.420]  It's 10? I thought it was 20. Oh, no.
[14:04.500 --> 14:05.880]  Okay. Well, that was really good.
[14:06.080 --> 14:07.000]  I can't believe that.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.800]  You're only 1.99 away.
[14:12.120 --> 14:15.240]  Have you tried using the left trigger just to see if it breaks?
[14:15.240 --> 14:16.540]  I did that time.
[14:16.740 --> 14:17.120]  Okay.
[14:18.660 --> 14:21.160]  But I guess I didn't use it enough because I was kind of tapping it.
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.460]  I don't know if it did anything or not. We'll find out.
[14:25.540 --> 14:26.840]  Do you go to Costco at all?
[14:27.460 --> 14:29.180]  Oh, dude. Big Costco guy.
[14:29.540 --> 14:30.480]  Big Costco guy?
[14:30.740 --> 14:32.780]  Big Costco guy. It's the only pizza my kid eats.
[14:35.100 --> 14:40.460]  I feel like the Costco parking experience is the worst grocery store experience.
[14:40.500 --> 14:41.920]  I totally agree with you.
[14:43.540 --> 14:44.600]  Totally agree with you.
[14:44.740 --> 14:46.480]  Because everybody's looking for the close spot.
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.120]  They're all mostly aggressive.
[14:49.520 --> 14:51.400]  And then also, there's the gas station right there.
[14:52.160 --> 14:52.340]  Yep.
[14:52.940 --> 14:54.620]  And people are flying out of that.
[14:55.400 --> 15:02.040]  Ours is built in a stupid way where there's shrubs that block you from being able to see left or right if you're in the gas station too.
[15:02.700 --> 15:04.540]  So they're just like, I'm making my best guess.
[15:05.580 --> 15:06.940]  Oh, it's a nightmare.
[15:07.440 --> 15:08.100]  Alright, let's see.
[15:09.580 --> 15:10.440]  Here we go.
[15:11.100 --> 15:12.120]  Here we go.
[15:12.220 --> 15:13.860]  You got this. You got this.
[15:14.060 --> 15:14.560]  Here we go.
[15:15.540 --> 15:16.740]  I'm coming too hot.
[15:18.100 --> 15:18.900]  I'm too hot.
[15:18.980 --> 15:20.300]  That was beautiful.
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.360]  Oh, slow.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.680]  I like it.
[15:24.260 --> 15:25.440]  I like it.
[15:25.600 --> 15:26.080]  Keep going.
[15:26.640 --> 15:27.320]  Alright, now slow.
[15:27.880 --> 15:28.420]  Now slow.
[15:29.120 --> 15:29.620]  Slow.
[15:30.740 --> 15:31.540]  Slow up.
[15:31.660 --> 15:32.160]  Bring it in. Bring it in.
[15:32.340 --> 15:33.340]  Yeah, come on.
[15:33.620 --> 15:34.980]  Come on. Come on. Stop. Stop.
[15:35.240 --> 15:35.800]  Yeah.
[15:35.940 --> 15:36.700]  That was so good.
[15:36.700 --> 15:37.300]  We did it.
[15:38.540 --> 15:39.600]  Four meters.
[15:41.680 --> 15:43.300]  On to the next one.
[15:43.420 --> 15:43.940]  Oh my god.
[15:44.620 --> 15:50.360]  I don't know why it's so much less stressful without, I don't know, Gavin or Eric watching and commenting.
[15:53.220 --> 15:56.720]  Well now is the perfect time to reveal Gavin and Eric.
[15:56.980 --> 15:57.180]  Oh god.
[15:57.180 --> 15:58.180]  Come on down.
[15:58.280 --> 15:58.720]  Oh no.
[15:58.900 --> 16:00.660]  Jump out of a military plane and catch a parachute.
[16:00.780 --> 16:01.140]  Ooh.
[16:02.040 --> 16:02.720]  That's fun.
[16:03.220 --> 16:04.360]  Yeah, this is some cool guy shit.
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.660]  Oh hell yeah. Ooh.
[16:08.520 --> 16:08.960]  Oh.
[16:09.520 --> 16:11.340]  Oh, you look so good too.
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.160]  Oh, it looks awesome.
[16:12.560 --> 16:13.720]  You're stylish.
[16:13.740 --> 16:14.400]  Uh, jump.
[16:15.440 --> 16:15.920]  Whoa.
[16:18.080 --> 16:20.360]  How am I traveling through the air quicker?
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.940]  Uh, press whatever button?
[16:23.780 --> 16:23.960]  Yeah.
[16:27.020 --> 16:27.700]  Got it.
[16:28.980 --> 16:29.460]  Nice.
[16:29.760 --> 16:30.520]  Open the chute when I'm ready.
[16:32.940 --> 16:33.780]  Where is it?
[16:35.160 --> 16:35.860]  What do you mean?
[16:35.980 --> 16:36.320]  The target.
[16:36.320 --> 16:37.140]  Oh, the landing mark?
[16:37.140 --> 16:39.420]  Yeah, I wish I could see without snow.
[16:40.420 --> 16:42.340]  Yeah, it would be a lot easier if you didn't have snow.
[16:43.780 --> 16:45.020]  Yeah, I don't know where I'm going, so.
[16:45.160 --> 16:45.700]  Oh, there it is.
[16:46.400 --> 16:47.500]  I'm not gonna make it, am I?
[16:51.060 --> 16:52.240]  Uh, it might be close.
[16:57.870 --> 16:58.970]  Now I'm gonna hit the hill.
[17:00.190 --> 17:02.550]  You need a big gust of wind right now.
[17:02.670 --> 17:02.850]  Yeah.
[17:03.210 --> 17:04.210]  I'll just do this.
[17:07.010 --> 17:08.150]  That's one way to handle it.
[17:08.550 --> 17:09.850]  We're not gonna make it.
[17:12.610 --> 17:15.870]  But did you have to pop your chute when you did, or could you do it whenever you want?
[17:16.390 --> 17:17.650]  Uh, I could do it whenever I wanted.
[17:18.110 --> 17:18.350]  Okay.
[17:19.090 --> 17:21.170]  So I guess, probably, a little bit higher.
[17:22.750 --> 17:28.290]  I guess, so I guess time is not the issue here, it's the, just distance to the thing.
[17:28.350 --> 17:28.950]  Distance, yeah.
[17:30.230 --> 17:30.770]  I missed it.
[17:33.230 --> 17:33.590]  Huh.
[17:35.930 --> 17:36.130]  Well.
[17:36.270 --> 17:37.210]  You missed, well, go up.
[17:37.210 --> 17:38.470]  Slow down.
[17:39.410 --> 17:41.170]  Oh, it can catch up to me? That's cool.
[17:43.670 --> 17:44.110]  Where?
[17:44.330 --> 17:45.350]  Oh, is it over there now?
[17:46.270 --> 17:47.530]  I think that's it.
[17:48.890 --> 17:55.050]  I didn't realize that the backpack would fall at a faster rate than I would.
[17:56.190 --> 17:57.750]  Oh, I mean science, obviously.
[17:58.930 --> 18:00.770]  That is exactly how it would work.
[18:01.810 --> 18:02.850]  Alright, let's do this.
[18:02.850 --> 18:03.150]  There you go.
[18:03.730 --> 18:05.630]  Wow, okay, just bop in the chute immediately.
[18:05.630 --> 18:08.390]  Well, I think we needed to, because look at how far we ended up.
[18:08.390 --> 18:09.590]  Yeah, yeah, you are pretty low.
[18:12.050 --> 18:12.410]  Okay.
[18:14.110 --> 18:16.630]  If I slow it down like this...
[18:17.770 --> 18:21.790]  Well, the thing with slowing it down, though, are you reducing how far you'll go?
[18:21.910 --> 18:22.850]  I don't, no.
[18:23.330 --> 18:25.530]  I think you, like, it feels like you kind of lost...
[18:25.530 --> 18:26.630]  No, I think...
[18:28.930 --> 18:30.390]  See, eh, that's hard to tell.
[18:31.110 --> 18:32.630]  Ooh, but if I do that...
[18:33.810 --> 18:35.830]  See, this is why we're in flight school.
[18:38.750 --> 18:39.950]  I like your parachute.
[18:40.310 --> 18:40.730]  Hey, thanks.
[18:42.010 --> 18:42.650]  Alright, well.
[18:43.590 --> 18:43.990]  Whoa!
[18:45.630 --> 18:46.750]  Oh, you lived!
[18:47.030 --> 18:48.190]  I did live that time.
[18:48.430 --> 18:51.150]  That had to have hurt your face.
[18:52.070 --> 18:52.430]  No.
[18:52.670 --> 18:54.450]  As to slow down, I think this is a piece of cake.
[18:54.450 --> 18:55.150]  Walk it off.
[18:57.030 --> 18:58.730]  Okay, well now I know I can miss it.
[18:59.230 --> 18:59.770]  That's good to know.
[18:59.770 --> 19:00.130]  Oh, yeah.
[19:01.050 --> 19:01.870]  That is good to know.
[19:01.870 --> 19:02.490]  Alright, here we go.
[19:04.010 --> 19:05.950]  Much like the last one, you're narrowing in it.
[19:07.530 --> 19:10.930]  Once you see the target and you can land in it, you're gonna be perfect.
[19:11.830 --> 19:14.870]  Yeah, once I get this before a mile...
[19:15.990 --> 19:16.470]  Here we go.
[19:17.110 --> 19:17.730]  Got it.
[19:18.010 --> 19:18.450]  Nice!
[19:18.550 --> 19:19.870]  Alright, now...
[19:25.770 --> 19:27.270]  You can pop at any time.
[19:29.210 --> 19:31.130]  Yeah, I think I will now.
[19:31.630 --> 19:36.150]  It's hard to tell how much forward progress you're making in that freefall.
[19:36.390 --> 19:36.850]  I agree.
[19:41.810 --> 19:43.290]  Oh, you got a little dips going?
[19:44.010 --> 19:47.030]  Some dips, see if we can't, you know, push...
[19:48.550 --> 19:49.470]  It is?
[19:50.550 --> 19:51.250]  Here we go.
[19:51.270 --> 19:51.810]  Oh, I see it!
[19:52.770 --> 19:54.490]  Oh, you're perfect!
[19:55.370 --> 19:56.070]  Oh, I don't know.
[19:56.390 --> 19:57.030]  Here we go.
[20:00.010 --> 20:01.410]  It's okay, we can always circle.
[20:04.110 --> 20:06.470]  So I just need to land in the middle of that bad boy, huh?
[20:07.050 --> 20:07.270]  Yep.
[20:08.790 --> 20:09.230]  Okay.
[20:10.870 --> 20:12.050]  Let's do this.
[20:12.050 --> 20:12.770]  Oh, nice reset.
[20:14.310 --> 20:15.970]  Oh, you might be coming in a little bit hot.
[20:16.370 --> 20:16.870]  That's alright.
[20:18.250 --> 20:19.250]  Slowing it down again.
[20:19.270 --> 20:20.030]  What a pro!
[20:20.230 --> 20:20.730]  Let's see.
[20:21.190 --> 20:22.070]  What a pro!
[20:22.390 --> 20:22.950]  Here we go.
[20:23.770 --> 20:24.750]  It's alright, we're gonna circle.
[20:25.450 --> 20:25.850]  Oh, Nick!
[20:26.290 --> 20:27.190]  We're circling.
[20:27.970 --> 20:28.850]  Oh, Nick!
[20:29.070 --> 20:30.070]  It's okay, we're circling.
[20:31.710 --> 20:32.470]  Oh, boy!
[20:32.810 --> 20:33.190]  It's alright.
[20:35.390 --> 20:36.110]  Holy shit!
[20:36.310 --> 20:38.710]  I'm gonna miss it, I'm gonna miss it, I'm gonna miss it, unless I swing back.
[20:38.810 --> 20:38.990]  Oh, it's so disorienting!
[20:39.010 --> 20:40.170]  I fucked it, I fucked it, I fucked it!
[20:40.170 --> 20:40.590]  Oh, wait!
[20:40.670 --> 20:43.030]  No, you gotta turn, turn, turn, turn, turn!
[20:43.350 --> 20:43.710]  Ah!
[20:44.170 --> 20:44.530]  Damn!
[20:46.570 --> 20:47.830]  Oh, you're close!
[20:47.930 --> 20:48.550]  Okay, alright.
[20:50.130 --> 20:50.870]  I got cute.
[20:53.450 --> 20:55.030]  You did get, but...
[20:55.890 --> 20:57.090]  Hey, you got closer.
[20:57.330 --> 20:57.790]  I got closer.
[20:58.090 --> 20:58.310]  Here we go.
[20:58.350 --> 20:59.030]  You're making progress.
[20:59.570 --> 20:59.930]  Closer!
[21:02.310 --> 21:02.670]  Closer!
[21:02.670 --> 21:06.270]  Guys, we're working our way to 5-0-1 on a Friday.
[21:08.250 --> 21:13.090]  What do you think Geoff, Gavin, and Eric are doing right now?
[21:16.410 --> 21:17.310]  Petting a falcon.
[21:18.290 --> 21:19.550]  You think they're petting a falcon?
[21:19.710 --> 21:20.170]  They might be.
[21:21.110 --> 21:25.210]  I think Gavin just spilled a drink all over Eric.
[21:25.530 --> 21:26.570]  Oh, yeah, I think so.
[21:28.230 --> 21:28.890]  What do you think it was?
[21:29.070 --> 21:30.850]  I think Geoff is going, ah, mojito!
[21:31.430 --> 21:33.730]  Ooh, I was thinking Mai Tai.
[21:34.730 --> 21:35.670]  Ooh, I like that.
[21:36.590 --> 21:38.310]  But yeah, honestly, it could go either way.
[21:39.270 --> 21:40.730]  We're both locked in on M.
[21:41.070 --> 21:41.430]  Oh, yeah.
[21:44.630 --> 21:45.850]  I think they'll...
[21:47.190 --> 21:48.370]  Can I text him?
[21:49.030 --> 21:49.730]  Oh, yeah, you should.
[21:50.850 --> 21:51.630]  Oh, this is it.
[21:52.690 --> 21:53.490]  You got this!
[21:54.270 --> 21:54.730]  Nick!
[21:54.930 --> 21:55.390]  Nick!
[21:56.770 --> 21:58.110]  Wait, wait.
[22:00.230 --> 22:00.750]  What?
[22:01.550 --> 22:02.950]  What was I supposed to do?
[22:03.670 --> 22:07.390]  I think you walked out of the mini-circle.
[22:07.850 --> 22:08.350]  No.
[22:09.310 --> 22:10.250]  Yeah, I think...
[22:11.010 --> 22:11.530]  No!
[22:12.650 --> 22:13.850]  Did you hold forward at all?
[22:15.550 --> 22:18.490]  Because you took, like, five steps upon landing.
[22:19.470 --> 22:19.990]  I'm...
[22:19.990 --> 22:22.150]  I guess I did.
[22:22.650 --> 22:23.690]  Oh, wait, I went the wrong one.
[22:27.190 --> 22:27.710]  I...
[22:27.710 --> 22:29.230]  Nick, we have to go back!
[22:29.530 --> 22:29.790]  I know.
[22:30.330 --> 22:30.950]  Hold on.
[22:31.750 --> 22:32.610]  I'll end this quick.
[22:35.130 --> 22:35.690]  I...
[22:37.470 --> 22:38.650]  Here we go.
[22:43.200 --> 22:44.040]  Oh, yes.
[22:44.140 --> 22:45.020]  No, I hit retry!
[22:45.660 --> 22:47.100]  No, Nick!
[22:51.340 --> 22:53.160]  But I don't understand, like, so...
[22:53.820 --> 22:58.620]  Did I just let go of the soft landing too early or something?
[23:00.240 --> 23:01.440]  You either...
[23:01.440 --> 23:02.300]  Yeah, maybe.
[23:03.660 --> 23:06.040]  Did you hold forward at all after landing?
[23:06.120 --> 23:07.340]  I don't think so.
[23:07.900 --> 23:08.260]  Okay.
[23:08.560 --> 23:10.820]  Maybe it's just, like, you get propelled forward.
[23:10.960 --> 23:11.180]  Ugh.
[23:15.150 --> 23:16.330]  Alright, let's see.
[23:18.530 --> 23:21.470]  Let's try this one last time.
[23:23.210 --> 23:30.470]  Oh, so I guess somebody earlier said that the reason my stuff might be snow still is quick rejoin, I guess?
[23:30.750 --> 23:31.330]  But I...
[23:31.330 --> 23:31.710]  Quick resume?
[23:31.970 --> 23:32.370]  Quick resume?
[23:33.230 --> 23:40.090]  But how would I not have exited the game, like, completely if I've switched to other games and, like, turned off the Xbox?
[23:43.910 --> 23:44.350]  Uh...
[23:44.350 --> 23:49.390]  Yeah, I mean, there is a limit, I believe, to how many quick resumes you can have open at a time.
[23:50.230 --> 23:53.310]  So depending on how many other games you've played, that should cancel it out.
[23:54.030 --> 23:57.150]  You did say you fully, like, unplugged your Xbox.
[23:57.490 --> 23:58.810]  Yeah, it's been unplugged.
[23:58.810 --> 24:02.170]  And I would assume that that also should cancel that out.
[24:02.250 --> 24:03.490]  I would think so, right?
[24:04.410 --> 24:07.390]  I mean, I would certainly think, but... rarely.
[24:07.630 --> 24:08.310]  Alright, here we go.
[24:09.350 --> 24:10.530]  Screw this up a little bit.
[24:22.690 --> 24:27.900]  Uh... I'm gonna fuck this up.
[24:37.290 --> 24:38.270]  Come on, come on!
[24:38.430 --> 24:39.530]  I didn't get it, did I?
[24:40.030 --> 24:40.430]  Dammit!
[24:41.330 --> 24:43.010]  Okay, well you know now...
[24:43.010 --> 24:43.470]  I know how to do it!
[24:43.470 --> 24:46.370]  That there is a way to do it... perfectly.
[24:47.050 --> 24:49.030]  Is GTA pinned in your quick resume?
[24:49.250 --> 24:50.650]  Why are video games stupid?
[24:52.270 --> 24:53.190]  I don't know what that means.
[24:53.310 --> 24:53.690]  I don't either!
[24:54.170 --> 24:54.750]  I don't think it's pinned.
[24:54.750 --> 24:57.290]  I guess you could lock in certain titles in a quick resume?
[24:57.530 --> 24:58.390]  I guess so.
[24:58.990 --> 25:00.370]  I did not know that was a thing.
[25:00.590 --> 25:01.670]  I had no idea.
[25:02.470 --> 25:04.770]  That feels like a strangely specific feature.
[25:06.490 --> 25:07.130]  Oh, what a... yeah.
[25:08.770 --> 25:09.610]  Alright, here we go.
[25:10.850 --> 25:13.070]  And it's like, I've played multiple other games.
[25:13.070 --> 25:14.630]  I played Rocket League, I played...
[25:16.870 --> 25:17.790]  Black Ops.
[25:19.890 --> 25:20.750]  Some other shit.
[25:21.650 --> 25:22.970]  What were you doing in Black Ops?
[25:23.810 --> 25:25.850]  I was doing some Warzone.
[25:26.970 --> 25:28.190]  I love Warzone.
[25:28.970 --> 25:31.910]  Although I don't like the new iteration as much as the old one.
[25:31.970 --> 25:34.070]  I feel like there were other...
[25:35.990 --> 25:38.190]  Some things that were like...
[25:38.650 --> 25:41.130]  Were a little bit more helpful in the old version.
[25:41.130 --> 25:43.410]  Like, it's hard to see pings now.
[25:44.110 --> 25:47.250]  I felt like they were much more easily spotted in the old one.
[25:47.990 --> 25:50.470]  Have you played any of the Squid Game stuff?
[25:50.830 --> 25:51.230]  No!
[25:51.950 --> 25:52.570]  Is it any good?
[25:53.870 --> 25:56.770]  It's... yeah, they have like a red light, green light thing that's kind of fun.
[25:58.190 --> 25:59.130]  It seems like...
[25:59.830 --> 26:02.110]  Based off my performance here, that would be my kind of nightmare.
[26:05.470 --> 26:06.350]  You got this.
[26:06.470 --> 26:06.830]  Here we go.
[26:07.570 --> 26:08.370]  You're zoned in.
[26:09.910 --> 26:10.690]  Oh, perfect.
[26:10.690 --> 26:12.290]  Okay, slowing it down.
[26:12.670 --> 26:14.150]  Slowing it down.
[26:17.010 --> 26:19.130]  No, you stumbling fuck!
[26:20.590 --> 26:21.310]  No!
[26:24.230 --> 26:26.090]  That's such a load of bullshit.
[26:27.570 --> 26:28.730]  Yeah, it's pretty mean.
[26:30.250 --> 26:31.830]  That is pretty mean.
[26:33.910 --> 26:35.350]  I, uh...
[26:35.350 --> 26:36.670]  I'm having a good time.
[26:37.390 --> 26:40.110]  So just do what you did that one time.
[26:40.110 --> 26:41.230]  Where you had nothing.
[26:41.490 --> 26:43.890]  I had to come in at another angle.
[26:44.030 --> 26:44.890]  I guess I'll try that again.
[26:45.050 --> 26:46.030]  Maybe I was just coming in too hot.
[26:46.350 --> 26:50.470]  Yeah, like were you kind of almost pulling upward at the point of landing?
[26:50.610 --> 26:53.870]  Yeah, it was probably just like too fast, too late.
[27:02.280 --> 27:02.740]  Got it.
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.340]  Somebody asked earlier in the chat if we were going to play more of Last of Us Part II.
[27:09.420 --> 27:10.060]  I would love to.
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.700]  We just need to find time to do that again.
[27:13.200 --> 27:13.520]  Yes.
[27:14.340 --> 27:15.960]  You just put out a trailer for it, right?
[27:16.620 --> 27:17.860]  The HBO show.
[27:18.020 --> 27:19.000]  Oh, did they put out another one?
[27:19.920 --> 27:21.900]  I think recently, yeah. I could be wrong.
[27:22.140 --> 27:24.580]  I saw the initial one a while back, which was cool.
[27:26.040 --> 27:27.360]  What was the initial one?
[27:28.540 --> 27:30.280]  Oh boy, there's a lot of stuff.
[27:30.700 --> 27:33.420]  It was like a teaser thing with like everything all at once.
[27:33.680 --> 27:34.100]  Oh, okay.
[27:36.460 --> 27:39.900]  I know like Abby is in I think the one that I saw recently.
[27:41.780 --> 27:43.480]  Come on. Come on.
[27:44.160 --> 27:45.340]  I stumbled into it.
[27:45.340 --> 27:47.560]  No, I stumbled out of it.
[27:48.780 --> 27:50.720]  Oh, you're so close.
[27:51.780 --> 27:53.900]  That isn't necessarily a bad idea though.
[27:55.040 --> 27:55.860]  Factoring in the stumble.
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.980]  Yeah, I think I can factor in the stumble.
[27:59.880 --> 28:01.140]  It's so stupid though.
[28:02.880 --> 28:03.960]  It's so...
[28:03.960 --> 28:06.460]  And you passed this? How long did it take you?
[28:07.960 --> 28:11.780]  Um, I think I got this one on like my fifth try.
[28:11.880 --> 28:15.600]  But there's some other ones that really kicked me in the dick.
[28:17.500 --> 28:19.520]  This one's already kicked me in the dick.
[28:21.120 --> 28:24.660]  This one wasn't as bad, but the next one I sucked at.
[28:25.240 --> 28:25.620]  Oh, really?
[28:26.180 --> 28:26.660]  Yeah.
[28:28.960 --> 28:31.880]  You got this one. You figured it out.
[28:32.460 --> 28:34.460]  You got all the strategies down.
[28:38.500 --> 28:43.380]  Hey, Lordaman, I've been using the left bumper and right bumper to slow down. Thank you.
[28:49.360 --> 28:53.440]  The backseat gaming in this scenario is very funny because there's no seat.
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.580]  Back sky, I guess?
[28:56.860 --> 28:57.380]  Tandem?
[28:58.320 --> 28:59.160]  Tandem seat?
[29:01.440 --> 29:03.400]  You got this. You got this.
[29:04.460 --> 29:06.260]  Oh, it's easy. Nick, it's easy.
[29:07.960 --> 29:10.040]  Oh, he stumbled out of it again.
[29:11.280 --> 29:12.360]  God damn it!
[29:16.260 --> 29:17.020]  It's just, it's...
[29:17.020 --> 29:17.740]  Hold on, good news is...
[29:17.740 --> 29:17.940]  Yeah?
[29:18.760 --> 29:20.640]  It passed. You got less than passed.
[29:21.260 --> 29:21.700]  Great.
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.720]  You're doing great. You just, you know, shortened it a little bit.
[29:26.520 --> 29:29.220]  The fancy jewelry, you're getting some cash every time.
[29:29.340 --> 29:29.780]  500?
[29:29.780 --> 29:31.040]  You're getting those reputation points.
[29:31.180 --> 29:35.140]  Are those as useful as the JP points?
[29:36.400 --> 29:37.680]  Uh, they're more useful.
[29:37.920 --> 29:38.220]  Are they?
[29:38.220 --> 29:41.000]  Yeah, like they get you weapons and stuff.
[29:41.120 --> 29:41.600]  Alright, here we go.
[29:41.840 --> 29:43.220]  You're not getting a lot of them, but...
[29:44.780 --> 29:45.480]  I'm still getting some.
[29:50.410 --> 29:54.050]  Okay, well, I screwed the pooch on this, but I got that.
[29:54.730 --> 29:55.110]  Yeah, easy.
[29:55.350 --> 29:55.570]  Easy.
[29:59.330 --> 30:00.330]  Here we go!
[30:02.710 --> 30:03.010]  Okay.
[30:03.030 --> 30:05.710]  Do you think the next Switch will launch with a 3D Mario?
[30:07.550 --> 30:09.410]  What's the time frame for it to launch?
[30:10.290 --> 30:11.430]  Uh, this year...
[30:13.170 --> 30:14.410]  I think, uh...
[30:16.670 --> 30:17.910]  Hmm, probably not.
[30:17.990 --> 30:20.270]  They've been really bad at, like, timing out that stuff lately.
[30:22.710 --> 30:23.270]  You know?
[30:23.470 --> 30:25.750]  What do you think will be the launch game, then, for Switch 2?
[30:25.970 --> 30:26.570]  You have to guess.
[30:28.750 --> 30:30.790]  Probably, like, a repeat of something else.
[30:31.210 --> 30:31.830]  Oh, Nick!
[30:31.910 --> 30:32.450]  Oh, I...
[30:33.770 --> 30:34.810]  Well, you did... Hey!
[30:35.570 --> 30:36.590]  Whatever you did there...
[30:37.770 --> 30:38.250]  Do that!
[30:38.610 --> 30:38.970]  But...
[30:39.570 --> 30:40.450]  10 feet forward.
[30:43.310 --> 30:45.590]  Do that. Oh, yeah, maybe Mario Kart, actually.
[30:45.770 --> 30:46.910]  We haven't had one in a while, have we?
[30:47.090 --> 30:47.790]  Oh, yeah.
[30:48.790 --> 30:51.730]  Because the Switch one was just the Wii U one, right?
[30:52.070 --> 30:53.650]  No, it was, like, its own thing, wasn't it?
[30:54.250 --> 30:56.210]  I thought it was just a re-release of the Wii U.
[30:56.210 --> 30:56.430]  Was it really?
[30:56.830 --> 30:59.790]  Well, I think maybe initially it was, and they added on a bunch of shit to it.
[31:00.030 --> 31:04.590]  Yeah, I think there was DLC for it, but I think the base of it is just the...
[31:04.590 --> 31:05.330]  Like a Wii U port.
[31:05.770 --> 31:06.930]  Oh, interesting. I didn't know that.
[31:06.930 --> 31:08.090]  I didn't have it.
[31:08.370 --> 31:09.310]  I think I... Maybe...
[31:09.310 --> 31:09.570]  Oh!
[31:10.390 --> 31:11.510]  You know what? I think you might be right.
[31:14.410 --> 31:15.950]  Well, you know what else I'm right about?
[31:16.110 --> 31:16.190]  What's that?
[31:16.190 --> 31:17.930]  Is that you're gonna get a gold right here.
[31:18.090 --> 31:19.170]  Oh, yeah.
[31:24.290 --> 31:25.030]  There we go.
[31:25.390 --> 31:25.970]  Here we go.
[31:28.790 --> 31:29.990]  You got this.
[31:31.350 --> 31:31.610]  Okay.
[31:31.610 --> 31:32.690]  I like the angle.
[31:34.330 --> 31:35.670]  I like this a lot.
[31:36.290 --> 31:37.690]  I'm feeling good.
[31:37.770 --> 31:40.550]  If I can just get it right over it and just drop straight down.
[31:44.010 --> 31:44.410]  Nice.
[31:45.690 --> 31:48.090]  You fucking twat. I don't understand.
[31:49.070 --> 31:54.190]  So maybe because you're landing outside of the circle, it just doesn't do the step forward.
[31:54.390 --> 31:56.490]  Maybe you only step forward if you're in the circle.
[31:57.430 --> 32:00.290]  Like if you miss the circle, they just instant fail you?
[32:00.450 --> 32:00.570]  Oh.
[32:01.490 --> 32:04.730]  Oh, no, I guess there was that one time you stopped, a dead stop in the circle.
[32:04.810 --> 32:06.850]  If you cut the chute, do you still stumble forward?
[32:07.750 --> 32:09.490]  I have no idea. I didn't do that.
[32:09.490 --> 32:12.070]  I've never been able to land without stumbling forward.
[32:12.190 --> 32:13.830]  It's just the way they do it, I feel like.
[32:14.090 --> 32:18.330]  Because I'm holding back the bumpers to do it.
[32:18.390 --> 32:20.010]  You could auto adjust, once again.
[32:20.150 --> 32:24.370]  I kind of like what you're doing, landing outside of it to walk into it.
[32:24.570 --> 32:25.610]  Yeah, I could try that again.
[32:28.090 --> 32:29.770]  Let's give that a shot.
[32:30.810 --> 32:31.350]  Here we go.
[32:32.210 --> 32:32.990]  Here we go.
[32:33.110 --> 32:33.770]  Here we go.
[32:34.070 --> 32:35.030]  Okay, here we go.
[32:37.590 --> 32:40.510]  Do you think the Switch 2 will have 4K rumble?
[32:42.110 --> 32:42.990]  What? 4K?
[32:43.610 --> 32:46.250]  Yeah, because the Switch had HD rumble.
[32:46.850 --> 32:47.710]  Oh, I don't know.
[32:48.730 --> 32:50.930]  That was one of their big things when it came out.
[32:51.010 --> 32:53.890]  I don't feel like they really utilized it that much.
[32:55.030 --> 32:55.590]  Probably not.
[32:55.590 --> 33:00.490]  It was like the thing with 1-2 Switch of like, you can feel how many ice cubes are in a glass.
[33:00.870 --> 33:01.830]  That's crazy.
[33:01.830 --> 33:09.290]  Do you think that that will have a better picture than the original Switch?
[33:09.290 --> 33:09.950]  Than the base Switch?
[33:10.170 --> 33:10.410]  Yeah.
[33:11.190 --> 33:11.750]  Yes.
[33:12.450 --> 33:12.890]  Do you?
[33:13.610 --> 33:14.270]  I do.
[33:14.910 --> 33:17.930]  I don't know if it'll be better than the OLED Switch, but...
[33:19.050 --> 33:20.090]  I think they'll...
[33:20.730 --> 33:22.290]  Now that was a whole roll!
[33:23.910 --> 33:27.130]  That wasn't even a little stutter, that was a full-on...
[33:27.950 --> 33:29.650]  That was like a tactical dive.
[33:30.510 --> 33:32.090]  Did you expect to get stuck on this?
[33:32.590 --> 33:34.110]  Why is this flying? This isn't flying.
[33:35.770 --> 33:41.530]  Yeah, I mean, if this is viewed as flying, I would say you're not doing a great job at it.
[33:41.610 --> 33:41.970]  No!
[33:42.610 --> 33:43.330]  It's not a fault.
[33:45.250 --> 33:47.230]  Yeah, I should get a gold medal for the roll.
[33:48.090 --> 33:49.370]  The roll was very cool.
[33:49.570 --> 33:53.010]  When I say you're not doing a good job at it, I just meant that people can't fly.
[33:53.990 --> 33:54.870]  It's not your fault.
[33:55.430 --> 33:57.590]  It's just our inability as people.
[33:57.590 --> 34:00.930]  Yeah, that is a failing on a species level.
[34:03.530 --> 34:04.450]  I missed it.
[34:04.710 --> 34:06.310]  Okay, circle back.
[34:06.990 --> 34:14.290]  So I didn't like the circle method of trying to go around, because it just ended up making me go faster as I slung.
[34:15.050 --> 34:21.110]  So I think the best play is, what you were saying, is just to go for the outer edge, step into the middle.
[34:23.810 --> 34:24.290]  Exactly.
[34:25.490 --> 34:26.570]  So let's do that.
[34:29.310 --> 34:29.890]  Alright.
[34:30.230 --> 34:30.550]  I fully believe.
[34:30.990 --> 34:34.110]  I believe that we will win.
[34:34.370 --> 34:35.970]  You are going so fast.
[34:36.010 --> 34:36.210]  Yeah.
[34:39.290 --> 34:40.370]  Alright, here we go.
[34:40.430 --> 34:41.570]  Okay, I like the angle.
[34:44.930 --> 34:45.800]  Okay, okay.
[34:46.250 --> 34:47.310]  Slowing it down.
[34:47.590 --> 34:48.650]  Slowing it, okay.
[34:49.310 --> 34:49.770]  Okay.
[34:49.770 --> 34:50.390]  Here we go.
[34:51.490 --> 34:55.630]  Oh, you stumbled out to silver.
[34:57.370 --> 34:59.810]  Oh, you're so close though.
[35:00.650 --> 35:03.330]  Like one foot earlier and you're in.
[35:10.620 --> 35:16.520]  Landing in the circle is harder than doing a loop-de-loop or landing a plane with a failing engine.
[35:16.600 --> 35:17.240]  That was fun.
[35:18.460 --> 35:19.740]  Oh, this isn't fun?
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.600]  You're not having a blast doing this for the 50th time?
[35:24.600 --> 35:25.300]  I'm getting better.
[35:25.340 --> 35:25.680]  You know what?
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.460]  I think just by virtue of having to do this, I'm improving at parachuting and flying.
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.360]  Now, imagine there's a heist where we have to land very precisely.
[35:38.780 --> 35:39.840]  Oh, we've already done that heist.
[35:41.500 --> 35:42.180]  Oh, no.
[35:42.440 --> 35:44.860]  You're right, you're right.
[35:44.980 --> 35:45.340]  Oh, no.
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.040]  Then Gavin shot out my parachute I saw on the footage.
[35:50.580 --> 35:51.220]  Oh, really?
[35:51.440 --> 35:52.700]  Yeah, I didn't realize that.
[35:52.800 --> 35:54.300]  I was like, wow, what a rough landing.
[35:54.300 --> 35:57.260]  It's because Gavin aimed up and shot the parachute.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.460]  And so it made me...
[35:59.460 --> 36:00.600]  He is a fucking mess.
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.920]  There are times where I feel like this isn't real.
[36:07.080 --> 36:08.580]  You're just trying to cause chaos.
[36:09.200 --> 36:10.340]  And then you'll look at his footage.
[36:10.500 --> 36:11.220]  It'll be like, oh, yeah.
[36:12.220 --> 36:15.500]  This son of a bitch was breaking all the windows when we're trying to be stealthy.
[36:16.300 --> 36:17.900]  We got some good ones coming up, though.
[36:18.800 --> 36:19.360]  Oh, yeah.
[36:21.600 --> 36:22.120]  Dude.
[36:23.020 --> 36:27.180]  There's one footage, one bit of footage that still makes me laugh.
[36:27.220 --> 36:31.420]  Every time I watch it, I burst out laughing just because of how ridiculous it is.
[36:32.360 --> 36:33.040]  Oh, can I do it?
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.280]  Oh, come on, come on.
[36:35.340 --> 36:35.680]  Into it.
[36:36.100 --> 36:36.400]  Yes.
[36:37.400 --> 36:37.780]  Yes.
[36:38.440 --> 36:38.960]  Yeah.
[36:39.280 --> 36:40.120]  All right.
[36:40.760 --> 36:42.200]  Good job, Nick.
[36:47.600 --> 36:48.560]  One point.
[36:48.820 --> 36:49.720]  Oh, thank God.
[36:51.080 --> 36:52.440]  It's like a victory sip of water.
[36:53.040 --> 36:55.120]  Oh, Christ.
[36:57.420 --> 36:57.780]  Okay.
[36:58.380 --> 37:00.320]  All right, I'm feeling much better.
[37:00.600 --> 37:01.120]  City landing.
[37:01.300 --> 37:02.580]  Landed tight in the city in bad weather.
[37:02.720 --> 37:02.940]  All right.
[37:04.760 --> 37:07.280]  And I mean, listen, you live in bad weather now.
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.920]  I mean, yeah, the game is bad weather at this point.
[37:12.360 --> 37:13.120]  Where in the city?
[37:13.220 --> 37:13.820]  Just on a street?
[37:15.560 --> 37:16.360]  Uh, the beach.
[37:16.500 --> 37:17.360]  You end up landing on the beach.
[37:17.560 --> 37:17.740]  Oh.
[37:18.660 --> 37:22.360]  But it is like the other one where you have to land...
[37:22.360 --> 37:22.620]  Precisely.
[37:22.620 --> 37:23.800]  Very close to...
[37:36.970 --> 37:37.910]  What the hell did he say?
[37:38.930 --> 37:40.930]  He's saying you have a wild ass.
[37:41.110 --> 37:42.150]  Oh, cool. Thanks, man.
[37:42.370 --> 37:42.570]  Yeah.
[37:46.180 --> 37:46.840]  All right.
[37:47.300 --> 37:48.720]  So you gotta go through the next mark.
[37:48.920 --> 37:50.040]  Oh, engine down.
[37:50.320 --> 37:50.740]  Oh, dear.
[37:51.900 --> 37:52.740]  All right, well, that's interesting.
[38:02.000 --> 38:02.760]  And then...
[38:02.760 --> 38:04.480]  Maybe you lose another? I don't remember.
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.280]  Putting it in the dirt. Okay.
[38:10.640 --> 38:12.320]  Yeah, you're right.
[38:13.300 --> 38:15.020]  Okay, that's your landing coming up.
[38:15.480 --> 38:17.100]  Oh, on the beach. I see it. Okay.
[38:17.220 --> 38:17.440]  Yeah.
[38:24.060 --> 38:25.460]  No, there's no way.
[38:27.280 --> 38:28.360]  It's so tough.
[38:29.920 --> 38:33.500]  This is one of the types of ones where you're gonna require multiple tries.
[38:37.610 --> 38:38.010]  Oh.
[38:39.770 --> 38:40.270]  Oh.
[38:41.690 --> 38:44.770]  You're gonna require multiple times, unless you're Nick.
[38:46.690 --> 38:49.990]  In which case, it will still take multiple, but only a few.
[38:51.110 --> 38:52.930]  Nick, that was a great first run.
[38:53.310 --> 38:53.950]  Oh, God.
[38:54.930 --> 38:59.430]  Oh, sorry. I went really quiet for that end bit there, because it was just so like, I've got this.
[38:59.470 --> 39:00.110]  No, you were locked in.
[39:00.190 --> 39:03.090]  I was so close. That's so disappointing.
[39:03.390 --> 39:05.130]  You did so much better than I did on my first try.
[39:05.430 --> 39:06.350]  You killed that.
[39:06.490 --> 39:08.390]  Oh, I almost hit the thing again. Okay.
[39:09.630 --> 39:14.410]  The only annoyance with having to do this multiple times is that there's so much like, lead-in to the crash.
[39:14.410 --> 39:15.910]  There is such a long lead-in.
[39:16.230 --> 39:18.250]  You have like, five checkpoints you have to go through.
[39:18.290 --> 39:19.170]  Good Lord.
[39:26.200 --> 39:27.260]  That was so close.
[39:27.420 --> 39:30.740]  Have you ever traveled in a plane when it was like, snowing out? Really?
[39:31.900 --> 39:32.960]  A lightning storm?
[39:33.140 --> 39:34.640]  If I... well, definitely a lightning storm.
[39:36.260 --> 39:40.820]  But, usually it's like, I can see it off in the distance. Luckily, it wasn't like, around me.
[39:42.320 --> 39:43.260]  Oh, yeah.
[39:45.560 --> 39:49.160]  It's a freaky thing, for sure though, when you're flying, to see that kind of weather.
[39:51.380 --> 39:52.620]  Snow? I would not handle that well.
[39:52.740 --> 39:55.380]  I don't think I've ever flown with the snow.
[39:58.820 --> 39:59.740]  Yeah, I definitely haven't.
[40:01.700 --> 40:04.760]  That also seems like one of those scary kind of situations.
[40:05.500 --> 40:09.620]  Honestly, just seeing like, the cloud... being level with the clouds is trippy.
[40:10.660 --> 40:13.280]  Yeah. When you kind of look at it, it's just like...
[40:13.280 --> 40:15.180]  When you're in a cloud patch, and you look, and it's just like, oh.
[40:16.200 --> 40:17.540]  Like, nothing. This is crazy.
[40:19.640 --> 40:20.320]  I'm in the clouds.
[40:21.480 --> 40:22.200]  So weird.
[40:24.600 --> 40:25.080]  Pull up.
[40:25.580 --> 40:25.820]  Okay.
[40:31.500 --> 40:31.860]  Oh.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.700]  I feel like you got such good...
[40:36.700 --> 40:36.880]  Oh, I got screwed.
[40:37.780 --> 40:38.500]  Oh, no.
[40:40.140 --> 40:40.660]  Well.
[40:41.360 --> 40:41.820]  Well.
[40:42.100 --> 40:42.540]  Let's take off again.
[40:43.100 --> 40:44.960]  Yeah, let's turn it around.
[40:47.420 --> 40:49.320]  I can't restart. Wrong star.
[40:49.520 --> 40:49.780]  Nope.
[40:50.400 --> 40:50.920]  Damn.
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.400]  You can't restart, because this is Rockstar in 2012.
[40:56.640 --> 40:58.160]  Oh, I see.
[40:59.560 --> 41:01.040]  Is it set to performance mode?
[41:01.200 --> 41:01.900]  Yes, yes it is.
[41:03.540 --> 41:04.740]  Why does it look like shit?
[41:06.680 --> 41:08.900]  I mean, it's a game from 2012.
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.140]  Yeah, but they're constantly doing shit to it.
[41:13.300 --> 41:13.780]  It is true.
[41:16.560 --> 41:20.840]  Man, I think I had it on every generation of hardware.
[41:22.460 --> 41:23.540]  Definitely had it on 360.
[41:27.580 --> 41:29.580]  I definitely got it on...
[41:29.580 --> 41:32.240]  Well, I had it on PC also, now that I think about it.
[41:39.380 --> 41:40.740]  Which was really cool.
[41:42.640 --> 41:43.480]  Felt like it was ahead of its time.
[41:43.480 --> 41:45.500]  Oh, yeah, I imagine the mod scene is awesome.
[41:45.800 --> 41:46.320]  That was great.
[41:46.440 --> 41:48.880]  But also, it was really irritating with the load screens.
[41:49.260 --> 41:49.520]  Still.
[41:50.020 --> 41:53.440]  Okay, here we go.
[41:53.880 --> 41:55.200]  Here we go.
[41:58.480 --> 42:01.520]  If you had to emergency land a plane, do you think you'd be able to?
[42:01.680 --> 42:01.840]  No.
[42:03.400 --> 42:04.500]  Not a chance.
[42:06.500 --> 42:07.460]  Eh, no.
[42:09.700 --> 42:10.860]  Oh, we're actually drifting.
[42:10.960 --> 42:11.800]  I don't know.
[42:14.840 --> 42:15.920]  I think you could.
[42:16.240 --> 42:17.240]  You think I could?
[42:17.800 --> 42:21.860]  Yeah, with direction, like in a movie, where you're talking to the...
[42:21.860 --> 42:22.380]  Tower?
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.100]  Yeah, talking to the tower.
[42:24.720 --> 42:25.440]  Oh, boy.
[42:26.520 --> 42:27.480]  Oh, Nick!
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.820]  Oh, no!
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.620]  Does that mean it cost me the...
[42:35.360 --> 42:36.960]  I don't... I don't know.
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.780]  I mean, just try to land, I guess?
[42:43.580 --> 42:44.620]  Oh, if you...
[42:48.740 --> 42:49.100]  What?!
[42:49.100 --> 42:50.620]  You did it anyway?!
[42:52.040 --> 42:52.760]  That's crazy.
[42:52.940 --> 42:53.180]  Hell yeah!
[42:53.200 --> 42:53.800]  Good job, Nick!
[42:55.360 --> 42:56.000]  Hell yeah!
[42:56.300 --> 42:57.600]  Oh, shit, you're flying through!
[42:58.140 --> 43:00.880]  I could have used any... that was... that was not intentional.
[43:01.460 --> 43:02.740]  I regret saying that.
[43:03.020 --> 43:03.420]  I mean, you know.
[43:04.160 --> 43:05.960]  I'm just gonna step back and chat us for a minute.
[43:05.980 --> 43:07.420]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:08.320 --> 43:09.040]  Flying through.
[43:09.200 --> 43:11.440]  I think everybody was very questioning of that.
[43:11.440 --> 43:14.700]  Oh, now this is the training I need right here.
[43:15.360 --> 43:15.920]  Yes.
[43:16.600 --> 43:19.640]  The chopper is my greatest nemesis.
[43:20.600 --> 43:20.960]  Mm-hmm.
[43:21.740 --> 43:25.620]  I'm always saying that to other people in reference to you.
[43:27.820 --> 43:30.200]  You'd be shocked how often random people ask me,
[43:30.380 --> 43:31.780]  what's Nick's greatest nemesis?
[43:42.210 --> 43:42.770]  Actually...
[43:42.770 --> 43:44.490]  Yeah, you recovered pretty good.
[43:45.610 --> 43:47.370]  I don't... is your landing gear out?
[43:47.470 --> 43:48.830]  Is there landing gear in a chopper?
[43:49.430 --> 43:50.210]  There is!
[43:50.830 --> 43:51.090]  Yeah.
[43:51.250 --> 43:52.270]  Sweet, didn't know that.
[43:52.790 --> 43:55.330]  Okay, well, that's a bonus lesson.
[43:56.170 --> 43:58.070]  You got that one for free.
[43:58.490 --> 43:59.690]  Alright, bonus lesson.
[44:01.270 --> 44:02.210]  Blow me up!
[44:02.850 --> 44:04.090]  Let me die!
[44:04.570 --> 44:05.510]  He's going to the water.
[44:05.910 --> 44:07.590]  The water, my friend.
[44:10.470 --> 44:11.510]  Let me...
[44:11.510 --> 44:13.990]  It really doesn't want you to die.
[44:14.570 --> 44:14.970]  Please!
[44:15.890 --> 44:17.450]  No, you're just making it through.
[44:30.150 --> 44:32.170]  There's so much weight in that thud.
[44:32.790 --> 44:34.490]  Oh, dude, you could feel it in the controller.
[44:34.630 --> 44:35.310]  It was really funny.
[44:37.730 --> 44:38.130]  Okay.
[44:42.410 --> 44:43.250]  I can't see.
[44:43.390 --> 44:44.470]  Do you have your gear out already?
[44:44.610 --> 44:44.870]  I do.
[44:45.930 --> 44:46.330]  Nice.
[44:46.330 --> 44:47.330]  When you're ready.
[44:56.930 --> 44:57.970]  Okay, well...
[44:57.970 --> 44:59.290]  Oh, no.
[44:59.630 --> 45:00.050]  Oh, it's okay.
[45:00.790 --> 45:01.130]  It's alright.
[45:01.250 --> 45:01.650]  A little drift.
[45:02.190 --> 45:02.850]  Yeah, a little.
[45:02.950 --> 45:03.550]  A little drift.
[45:04.210 --> 45:05.050]  A little drift.
[45:06.110 --> 45:06.770]  Oh, shit.
[45:06.950 --> 45:07.610]  A little drift.
[45:09.530 --> 45:10.050]  Wait.
[45:11.270 --> 45:12.510]  I got it.
[45:14.930 --> 45:15.410]  There.
[45:21.150 --> 45:22.110]  Okay, well...
[45:22.110 --> 45:22.910]  A little drift.
[45:23.150 --> 45:23.410]  It's alright.
[45:23.490 --> 45:23.930]  We'll start over.
[45:24.570 --> 45:24.910]  Okay.
[45:25.570 --> 45:26.190]  We'll start over.
[45:26.990 --> 45:27.950]  Let's start over.
[45:28.370 --> 45:29.010]  Let's start over.
[45:29.470 --> 45:30.950]  Let's start...
[45:30.950 --> 45:31.470]  Wow!
[45:33.750 --> 45:35.350]  That was one way to start over.
[45:38.400 --> 45:41.680]  It took so long for it to actually...
[45:41.680 --> 45:43.860]  Also, it puts the landing gear away and stuff.
[45:43.860 --> 45:44.700]  Definitely, which is irritating.
[45:46.280 --> 45:46.960]  Okay, here we go.
[45:47.020 --> 45:47.360]  Here we go.
[45:47.500 --> 45:48.640]  We got this.
[45:50.340 --> 45:51.060]  Do it.
[45:54.080 --> 45:54.440]  Alright.
[45:58.480 --> 45:59.520]  That was cool.
[46:01.680 --> 46:02.400]  Okay, well...
[46:02.860 --> 46:03.380]  It's alright.
[46:03.560 --> 46:04.080]  We got it.
[46:04.120 --> 46:05.080]  We got it.
[46:05.140 --> 46:06.100]  Oh, nice recovery.
[46:06.440 --> 46:06.800]  Thank you.
[46:07.320 --> 46:09.620]  Oh, we're out of time on gold, though, I think.
[46:11.940 --> 46:12.440]  Hey, buddy.
[46:12.440 --> 46:13.240]  What is that?
[46:14.960 --> 46:15.320]  What?
[46:15.820 --> 46:17.380]  Oh, did you make a lollipop thing?
[46:17.460 --> 46:18.120]  Or is that a popsicle?
[46:20.060 --> 46:21.160]  Oh, thanks, bud.
[46:22.760 --> 46:23.120]  Aww.
[46:23.400 --> 46:24.300]  I would love to eat it.
[46:24.340 --> 46:27.240]  I'm also trying to fly this helicopter very poorly.
[46:28.580 --> 46:29.200]  Bye, buddy.
[46:32.160 --> 46:33.300]  Alright, well, that didn't go well.
[46:34.940 --> 46:35.860]  I would disagree.
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.600]  It sounds like you got a popsicle or something.
[46:37.860 --> 46:38.260]  Oh, yeah.
[46:38.360 --> 46:39.100]  Let's pretend, though.
[46:39.940 --> 46:40.660]  Oh, no.
[46:43.460 --> 46:45.380]  What's it pretend flavored?
[46:47.100 --> 46:47.560]  Uhhh...
[46:48.300 --> 46:49.320]  Star and cookie.
[46:49.780 --> 46:50.780]  Is that a star of flavor?
[46:52.180 --> 46:53.560]  I love a good star bar.
[46:54.320 --> 46:55.240]  Oh, damn it!
[46:55.540 --> 46:56.680]  Sorry, I went to the next one.
[46:56.780 --> 46:57.280]  No, that's okay.
[46:58.400 --> 47:00.240]  Well, this one's a nightmare.
[47:00.520 --> 47:00.840]  Oh, really?
[47:01.860 --> 47:02.320]  Yeah.
[47:02.440 --> 47:05.080]  Alright, well, let's take care of it real fast here.
[47:05.720 --> 47:07.460]  Let's take care of it real fast.
[47:09.920 --> 47:10.840]  Danger zone!
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.040]  D-d-d-d-danger zone!
[47:15.020 --> 47:15.800]  Alright, here we go.
[47:17.020 --> 47:18.580]  This is it. This is the run. I'm feeling good.
[47:23.180 --> 47:25.060]  19 seconds. That's good. You got it.
[47:37.950 --> 47:38.310]  Yeah!
[47:38.670 --> 47:38.950]  Nick!
[47:40.750 --> 47:41.730]  That was insane!
[47:42.670 --> 47:42.850]  That was awesome!
[47:44.870 --> 47:47.070]  It was like you got magnetized to it.
[47:47.130 --> 47:47.790]  That was...
[47:47.790 --> 47:49.090]  Wow! I did it!
[47:49.310 --> 47:49.930]  What do you have?
[47:50.950 --> 47:52.470]  No, not done yet. Sorry, bud.
[47:53.570 --> 47:54.350]  Oh, okay. Bye-bye.
[47:54.570 --> 47:55.710]  Holy crap.
[47:56.410 --> 47:58.450]  Woo! That felt good!
[47:58.790 --> 48:00.250]  That was real good, Nick.
[48:00.950 --> 48:04.030]  Woo! Alright, formation flight. Oh, crap.
[48:04.210 --> 48:05.310]  Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
[48:07.330 --> 48:07.850]  Alright.
[48:08.250 --> 48:11.670]  The gold was 19 seconds. You were 16 point something.
[48:11.790 --> 48:12.070]  Oh, really?
[48:12.150 --> 48:13.410]  Oh! That's a giant...
[48:13.410 --> 48:13.930]  That was crazy.
[48:14.430 --> 48:14.870]  ...lolly.
[48:15.950 --> 48:16.990]  Thank you.
[48:20.130 --> 48:21.670]  I do like that side.
[48:23.670 --> 48:24.490]  Thanks, bud.
[48:28.610 --> 48:30.350]  So you gotta try to line up with them.
[48:31.530 --> 48:32.610]  And keep within the circle.
[48:33.030 --> 48:33.550]  Oh, god.
[48:33.570 --> 48:35.350]  And it's gonna do some nonsense.
[48:35.810 --> 48:37.090]  Oh, god. I can't even keep up now.
[48:37.090 --> 48:39.830]  Well, actually, I found that my tip to you would be to have the landing gear out.
[48:41.250 --> 48:41.350]  Yeah.
[48:49.170 --> 48:51.030]  I mean, this is... Yeah, you got this.
[48:51.890 --> 48:52.350]  Hey, bud.
[48:54.050 --> 48:55.730]  Ooh! That one looks tasty!
[48:56.030 --> 48:56.490]  What's that one?
[49:00.610 --> 49:01.410]  Frosting vanilla?
[49:01.890 --> 49:02.290]  Mmm!
[49:02.290 --> 49:05.410]  Oh, I want some frosting vanilla.
[49:05.470 --> 49:06.030]  I know, me too.
[49:07.270 --> 49:08.750]  It's got chocolate, too?
[49:09.250 --> 49:10.090]  Oh, my god.
[49:11.310 --> 49:12.510]  What? Green chocolate?
[49:13.270 --> 49:13.650]  Whoa.
[49:13.950 --> 49:14.830]  Green chocolate?
[49:15.030 --> 49:16.150]  That's some wicked stuff, kid.
[49:19.390 --> 49:20.510]  Green, like the circle.
[49:21.110 --> 49:21.730]  Like the circle?
[49:22.270 --> 49:23.710]  You're chasing the chocolate circle.
[49:23.770 --> 49:24.290]  Yeah. Ah!
[49:25.390 --> 49:26.490]  Oh, what's this formation?
[49:27.870 --> 49:28.130]  Okay.
[49:28.390 --> 49:28.690]  Okay.
[49:29.530 --> 49:30.370]  Gotta catch it.
[49:31.010 --> 49:33.610]  Gotta catch that chocolate green circle.
[49:37.460 --> 49:39.700]  Oh, you're in the nom zone right now.
[49:39.900 --> 49:40.720]  Oh, I'm nomming.
[49:40.780 --> 49:40.940]  Hey!
[49:41.300 --> 49:41.540]  Ow!
[49:42.040 --> 49:42.720]  Thank you.
[49:42.880 --> 49:43.740]  You're just snacking away.
[49:43.760 --> 49:44.800]  I'm snacking, man.
[49:45.600 --> 49:47.780]  Snacking like a fiend over here.
[49:51.710 --> 49:52.270]  Hey.
[49:55.010 --> 49:56.130]  Nice adjustment.
[49:56.470 --> 49:56.830]  Thank you!
[49:58.110 --> 50:01.050]  Well, I can't wait until we run a formation mission.
[50:02.650 --> 50:03.570]  Oh, god.
[50:05.210 --> 50:05.950]  Oh, no.
[50:06.450 --> 50:07.970]  I bet Eric's the weak link in that.
[50:09.590 --> 50:10.410]  Ah, you know what?
[50:10.790 --> 50:11.970]  Neither of them are certified.
[50:12.610 --> 50:13.830]  Oh, well, I'm not yet.
[50:13.830 --> 50:15.030]  They're both gonna be weak links.
[50:15.310 --> 50:15.630]  Ooh!
[50:16.110 --> 50:16.850]  Oh, shit!
[50:17.550 --> 50:19.330]  Yep, and then it does that.
[50:19.770 --> 50:21.070]  And it's bullshit.
[50:21.890 --> 50:23.710]  Why didn't it warn me, at least?
[50:23.750 --> 50:25.270]  Alright, let's see if I can...
[50:25.270 --> 50:26.970]  Okay, they're gonna do it against you in a minute.
[50:27.850 --> 50:28.750]  Whoa, okay!
[50:32.330 --> 50:32.730]  Ayyyyy...
[50:32.730 --> 50:34.070]  What flavor was that billboard?
[50:36.450 --> 50:36.850]  Uhhh...
[50:36.850 --> 50:37.370]  Bad.
[50:37.850 --> 50:38.630]  It was a bad flavor.
[50:40.250 --> 50:43.310]  I liked how the chat was like, maybe he's gonna gold this first try.
[50:43.730 --> 50:43.950]  Nope.
[50:44.850 --> 50:45.670]  No, impossible.
[50:45.770 --> 50:46.890]  No, absolutely not.
[50:48.150 --> 50:49.910]  Man, you weren't kidding about that BS, though.
[50:50.550 --> 50:54.590]  Yeah, you're gonna have another loop after that, and then you have to hold it upside down.
[50:54.830 --> 50:57.330]  Might be easier to do that without the landing gear.
[50:58.130 --> 50:58.430]  Oh, maybe.
[50:58.430 --> 50:58.850]  Yeah.
[51:00.450 --> 51:00.870]  What you got, bud?
[51:02.390 --> 51:03.530]  You taking those back?
[51:04.390 --> 51:05.070]  Where you going?
[51:05.730 --> 51:06.270]  Oh, he's off.
[51:08.870 --> 51:10.730]  And he's gotta sell these to other people now.
[51:10.730 --> 51:11.410]  I guess so.
[51:11.990 --> 51:12.870]  He's starting a business.
[51:13.330 --> 51:16.790]  He certainly didn't ask for any money. I guess he's just giving away the goodness of his heart.
[51:17.670 --> 51:19.950]  He's giving the free samples out to get you hooked.
[51:21.730 --> 51:22.110]  Ohhh...
[51:22.110 --> 51:23.070]  It's like cocaine.
[51:25.450 --> 51:25.830]  Yes.
[51:25.830 --> 51:28.790]  Oh, the first one's always for you, kid.
[51:28.790 --> 51:31.790]  I wanted to know that you referred to your child's business as a cocaine business.
[51:31.950 --> 51:32.860]  No, I said it's like...
[51:33.710 --> 51:36.770]  It's like I was comparing it to a real life... you know, it's...
[51:36.770 --> 51:37.370]  What is that, a parable?
[51:40.570 --> 51:42.430]  I believe that's Triple H's finisher.
[51:43.690 --> 51:44.150]  Parable.
[51:51.170 --> 51:53.670]  Oh, we're flying in a vertical formation.
[51:54.610 --> 51:55.290]  Gotta catch up.
[52:00.450 --> 52:03.730]  Gives you a little bit of room for error, at least.
[52:03.730 --> 52:04.410]  Which is nice.
[52:04.810 --> 52:06.910]  It's pretty generous in these early ones.
[52:06.950 --> 52:09.450]  And then it says, fuck you.
[52:09.570 --> 52:10.970]  It sure does. Is that next?
[52:13.170 --> 52:13.650]  Uh...
[52:13.650 --> 52:15.070]  I don't think so.
[52:19.100 --> 52:21.560]  Yeah, that's after this one.
[52:21.600 --> 52:23.280]  Yeah, it's after this one.
[52:26.680 --> 52:29.220]  And I think it's a back-to-back loop.
[52:29.540 --> 52:29.640]  Oh, shit.
[52:30.640 --> 52:30.980]  Oh, shit.
[52:32.400 --> 52:32.880]  Okay.
[52:41.240 --> 52:42.080]  Oh, Nick.
[52:42.680 --> 52:43.500]  Oh, hello.
[52:44.680 --> 52:45.760]  That kinda helped.
[52:46.180 --> 52:46.960]  That did kinda help.
[52:46.980 --> 52:48.140]  Oh, adjust, adjust, adjust.
[52:48.460 --> 52:50.720]  I'm adjusting, I'm adjusting, I'm adjusting, I'm adjusting.
[52:50.820 --> 52:51.360]  Oh, where are they?
[52:51.420 --> 52:52.320]  Oh, God, where'd they go?
[52:53.100 --> 52:54.960]  I'm coming in, boys, don't forget me.
[52:54.960 --> 52:55.160]  Oh, snap back in.
[52:55.540 --> 52:56.660]  Don't forget me.
[52:57.680 --> 52:58.080]  Don't...
[52:58.940 --> 53:00.060]  Forget about me.
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.760]  Don't... oh, they're gone.
[53:02.120 --> 53:02.920]  Okay, they're going up.
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.140]  And then invert.
[53:06.560 --> 53:07.460]  You gotta invert, yeah.
[53:09.020 --> 53:09.820]  Get over.
[53:10.440 --> 53:10.900]  Get over.
[53:11.700 --> 53:12.100]  Okay.
[53:13.940 --> 53:15.020]  Oh, you fucker.
[53:17.660 --> 53:18.060]  No!
[53:21.580 --> 53:22.900]  Okay, that one sucks.
[53:23.700 --> 53:27.440]  It is real mean, but hey, you got to the end of it.
[53:28.540 --> 53:28.820]  Cool.
[53:28.940 --> 53:29.960]  There are no more curveballs.
[53:30.080 --> 53:31.760]  You know everything that's coming on this course.
[53:32.300 --> 53:35.620]  Well, yeah, but I didn't really get to experience a second curveball in real time.
[53:35.760 --> 53:36.960]  I was playing catch-up still.
[53:37.620 --> 53:38.240]  That's... yeah.
[53:39.140 --> 53:39.760]  That's fair.
[53:40.620 --> 53:41.920]  All right, back up we go.
[53:43.400 --> 53:46.440]  All right, we're coming up on 5.01.
[53:46.980 --> 53:48.320]  Oh, we're so close to it.
[53:48.320 --> 53:49.100]  Best time of the week.
[53:51.020 --> 53:53.080]  Got about seven minutes left on that, by the way.
[53:55.160 --> 53:56.660]  So let's hope for a good run here.
[53:57.220 --> 53:58.300]  Oh, you're going to have a great run.
[53:59.300 --> 54:05.180]  We're going to wrap, and then I'm immediately going to order all of your son's hot cocaine bars.
[54:05.440 --> 54:05.800]  No!
[54:05.800 --> 54:06.940]  They're not actually cocaine.
[54:08.020 --> 54:09.520]  That's what it says on the packaging.
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.280]  Oh, whoops.
[54:10.760 --> 54:11.940]  Man, he's being really literal.
[54:12.420 --> 54:12.780]  Not actually cocaine.
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.760]  It's supposed to say light crack, not actually crack.
[54:17.360 --> 54:18.180]  Addictive is crack.
[54:20.860 --> 54:23.120]  Addictive is crack would be quite the slogan.
[54:24.460 --> 54:26.900]  Yeah, probably unfortunate, I would imagine.
[54:27.260 --> 54:29.280]  It's light crack, but less harmful.
[54:30.120 --> 54:30.640]  Yeah.
[54:34.880 --> 54:35.600]  Okay, here we go.
[54:35.600 --> 54:39.360]  I wonder if there's anything legally that would prevent you from doing that, if a company wanted to.
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.780]  It would probably just be in bad taste.
[54:42.820 --> 54:45.860]  Yes, like undeniably bad taste, but I wonder...
[54:45.860 --> 54:46.200]  Like legally?
[54:46.940 --> 54:50.160]  Yeah, like if the FDA, if there's anything that prevents...
[54:50.160 --> 54:53.980]  I think you're okay as long as you're like, so good the CIA will do it. Yeah, bud?
[54:57.180 --> 54:58.060]  They are?
[55:02.340 --> 55:02.780]  Oh.
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.120]  I like to imagine that Archie's in the backseat of the fighter jet.
[55:14.300 --> 55:15.260]  I hope not.
[55:16.720 --> 55:18.420]  Oh, thank you.
[55:18.920 --> 55:19.400]  Okay.
[55:20.220 --> 55:21.860]  Why don't you go give mom some of those?
[55:22.960 --> 55:24.440]  You just did? Okay.
[55:27.560 --> 55:29.300]  Oh, that got me, Nick.
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.240]  Oh, that really got me.
[55:31.940 --> 55:33.140]  You calving? You alright?
[55:34.000 --> 55:34.400]  Yeah.
[55:35.100 --> 55:35.640]  I'm good.
[55:35.880 --> 55:36.760]  Oh, that was funny.
[55:39.160 --> 55:43.020]  That was some pro-level parenting right there. That was a Jedi mind trick.
[55:43.420 --> 55:46.060]  Ah! Archie, you blowing out my head, bud!
[55:46.280 --> 55:46.760]  Ow!
[55:49.120 --> 55:51.560]  God, he turned up my fucking volume!
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.500]  Oh, my God, I'm deaf! Jesus!
[55:59.500 --> 56:00.260]  Hey, bud!
[56:00.520 --> 56:01.580]  Archie's killing both of us!
[56:02.980 --> 56:04.000]  Oh, my God!
[56:04.000 --> 56:04.240]  Ah!
[56:04.840 --> 56:06.960]  My brain! Holy...
[56:06.960 --> 56:09.760]  That scared me. I was like, Andrew, your audio's getting blown out.
[56:09.820 --> 56:12.260]  And then I realized he cranked all my...
[56:12.260 --> 56:14.380]  He ate all your dials.
[56:14.500 --> 56:15.220]  Archie, you okay?
[56:17.920 --> 56:20.440]  Let's not touch those dials, alright?
[56:22.020 --> 56:22.840]  Oh, man.
[56:23.100 --> 56:23.500]  Ow!
[56:24.420 --> 56:26.480]  Oh, that was such a good run, too.
[56:28.860 --> 56:32.760]  Oh, man. I would argue it was still a good run.
[56:33.700 --> 56:34.960]  That was very funny.
[56:34.960 --> 56:39.700]  When I go deaf early, I'm going to remember that moment.
[56:41.220 --> 56:41.700]  Ow!
[56:44.760 --> 56:45.220]  Ow!
[56:46.180 --> 56:53.500]  So, I have a mini GoXLR, and it has the four sliders on it.
[56:53.600 --> 56:58.460]  The left one, the leftmost is my mic. And it is cranked all the way, so that's fine.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.580]  The two middle ones are off.
[57:01.500 --> 57:05.320]  And then the right one is controlling your audio and the game audio to me.
[57:06.460 --> 57:10.680]  And that's probably about a third of the way up.
[57:11.620 --> 57:15.280]  And then you suddenly got so loud.
[57:16.500 --> 57:20.400]  And I look over, and he's cranked all the other ones all the way up.
[57:22.620 --> 57:23.120]  Amazing.
[57:23.700 --> 57:24.580]  Oh, God.
[57:25.020 --> 57:26.900]  At least, I hope it was entertaining.
[57:27.960 --> 57:28.720]  Oh, it was hilarious.
[57:28.800 --> 57:29.300]  Okay, good.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.520]  Does it hurt? It hurt real bad.
[57:33.480 --> 57:34.720]  Oh, you're not the only one hurting.
[57:34.720 --> 57:36.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:36.480 --> 57:36.900]  Oh, man.
[57:38.220 --> 57:39.360]  Did you laugh so hard?
[57:39.520 --> 57:39.680]  That was really funny.
[57:40.560 --> 57:47.170]  I was trying to understand what exploding my head meant.
[57:47.470 --> 57:48.690]  Oh, what did I say?
[57:49.870 --> 57:52.410]  You're like, Archie, you're exploding my head.
[57:54.510 --> 57:56.010]  I was like, did he hit you or something?
[57:56.250 --> 57:58.950]  You know in the moment when you're like, I have no idea what to say?
[57:59.310 --> 58:01.870]  I think that was probably the closest it could have been.
[58:02.370 --> 58:04.130]  Yeah, it was a great descriptor.
[58:04.130 --> 58:04.630]  Okay.
[58:05.230 --> 58:07.110]  Well, he ran out of the room at that moment.
[58:08.450 --> 58:10.410]  Well, he was done blowing up your head.
[58:10.670 --> 58:11.310]  Yeah, I guess so.
[58:11.610 --> 58:12.210]  He accomplished his mission.
[58:12.210 --> 58:12.970]  You gotta move on to the next head.
[58:13.090 --> 58:13.270]  Yeah.
[58:14.550 --> 58:15.770]  More heads to blow up now.
[58:20.210 --> 58:23.850]  It would have been hilarious if the audience had that audible experience.
[58:24.230 --> 58:24.410]  Yeah.
[58:26.770 --> 58:27.630]  Yes and no.
[58:28.510 --> 58:29.150]  Well, yeah.
[58:31.150 --> 58:31.550]  Yes.
[58:32.110 --> 58:32.610]  You're right, yeah.
[58:33.830 --> 58:34.230]  Oh!
[58:39.160 --> 58:39.560]  Oh!
[58:39.880 --> 58:40.280]  Okay.
[58:41.380 --> 58:41.780]  Okay.
[58:42.440 --> 58:42.840]  Recover.
[58:44.400 --> 58:45.040]  Catch it.
[58:45.180 --> 58:46.120]  Oh, those jerks.
[58:46.520 --> 58:46.900]  I missed it.
[58:46.920 --> 58:47.200]  It's okay.
[58:47.260 --> 58:47.500]  It's okay.
[58:47.940 --> 58:48.380]  We're alright.
[58:48.500 --> 58:48.900]  Here we go.
[58:57.130 --> 58:57.530]  Oh!
[58:59.350 --> 59:00.250]  I missed it!
[59:00.330 --> 59:01.710]  Oh, Nick, you're so close!
[59:01.930 --> 59:02.870]  I missed it!
[59:03.830 --> 59:04.810]  That was it, though.
[59:04.830 --> 59:05.850]  That was such a good run.
[59:08.530 --> 59:10.630]  Gonna give it one more go and then we'll wrap stream.
[59:10.790 --> 59:12.050]  Let's do one more!
[59:13.070 --> 59:13.870]  Last run.
[59:13.870 --> 59:15.090]  Last run, let's...
[59:15.590 --> 59:16.610]  Last run or run?
[59:16.670 --> 59:17.910]  Did I say both at the same time?
[59:17.970 --> 59:18.850]  Both are fine.
[59:18.910 --> 59:19.370]  Both work.
[59:19.730 --> 59:22.470]  But I combined run and won somehow, so it was just...
[59:24.570 --> 59:25.210]  Let's do it!
[59:25.350 --> 59:25.730]  You're the...
[59:27.930 --> 59:28.490]  You're the...
[59:30.670 --> 59:35.950]  Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[59:36.310 --> 59:36.810]  This is it.
[59:36.850 --> 59:37.490]  This is the run.
[59:37.950 --> 59:39.430]  I hope you're all having a good Friday.
[59:40.270 --> 59:40.910]  A good Friday.
[59:41.170 --> 59:41.450]  Yeah.
[59:41.890 --> 59:51.070]  I had a... I heard a story when I worked in radio that a guy who worked for a conservative talk station, I guess, introduced a segment like,
[59:51.150 --> 59:52.270]  Oh, he's like, Good Friday.
[59:52.590 --> 59:55.630]  And a bunch of people called him mad that it wasn't actually Good Friday.
[59:56.250 --> 59:57.230]  Oh, God.
[59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.830]  Yeah, they were like, No! That's... No! That's a special Friday! Shut up!
[01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:02.950]  I think he meant to say, like...
[01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.370]  This is a mid-tier Friday.
[01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.050]  Right, exactly.
[01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:09.830]  I think he meant to say, like, Hey, welcome to another Good Friday.
[01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:10.610]  Like, you know.
[01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:11.330]  Yeah.
[01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:12.450]  Yeah, just being folksy.
[01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:13.390]  Yup.
[01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.410]  And he got lit a 501!
[01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.390]  501!
[01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.930]  Oh, what a time.
[01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.090]  Happy Friday, best time of the week.
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.670]  Treat yourself to something nice, like a drink.
[01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:30.070]  Oh.
[01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:33.170]  Like a cocaine bar from Archie.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.750]  Now available online.
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:38.790]  Have your head exploded.
[01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:43.250]  You started to sound like you were singing that one song from Mulan.
[01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:44.070]  Yeah, I was.
[01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:44.430]  Okay.
[01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.830]  I don't know why I went with that as the cadence of it, but...
[01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.730]  I mean, that is a good song.
[01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.010]  Oh, it's a great song.
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.850]  That's Donny Osmond.
[01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:55.210]  Yeah.
[01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.670]  That's crazy to me.
[01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.770]  Yeah, I learned that recently.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.810]  Yeah, I did too.
[01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.910]  I was blown away.
[01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.950]  I was like, What an interesting decision they made here.
[01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.230]  Oh, I'm feeling pretty confident about this run.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.450]  You're doing so good.
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:18.830]  Nice catch.
[01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:19.910]  Thank you.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.480]  Oh, that was lucky, but also unfortunate.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.040]  Catch it, catch it, catch it.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.120]  Don't know where it is.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:40.820]  Can't see it.
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.380]  Don't know.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.760]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:43.740]  Come on.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.220]  Oh, no.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.700]  Come on.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.560]  Oh, God.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:46.960]  Oh, no.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.600]  It's okay, we're alright.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.880]  I can catch it on the invert.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:51.320]  Yeah.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.580]  Okay.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.300]  You can still do it.
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.380]  Still do it.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.760]  Here we go.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.640]  Loop to the invert.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:01.660]  Nice.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.420]  Okay.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.080]  Come on.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.040]  Come on!
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.920]  Yeah, I think a little...
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.240]  No!
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:17.980]  Alright, well...
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.640]  Listen, you got certified in several courses.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.700]  You did really good.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.820]  I think this is a good showing.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.140]  There's more to build off of if we want to going forward.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.780]  But for now, you already got some gold licenses.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.380]  You know what?
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.540]  That's undeniable progress.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.520]  We're working our way up.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.160]  I felt good.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.120]  We're never going to fly upside down in formation, so...
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:36.280]  Never.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:36.900]  No.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.260]  I feel like in heist purposes, we've learned a lot.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.220]  I think the next one will be very helpful.
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.800]  And it looks like some of these later ones will be too.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.320]  A shooting range will be great.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:45.960]  Yes.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.440]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.600]  Yes, but thank you so much.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.480]  Have a wonderful weekend, everybody.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.280]  And we love you and we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.660]  Bye.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.500]  Bye.
