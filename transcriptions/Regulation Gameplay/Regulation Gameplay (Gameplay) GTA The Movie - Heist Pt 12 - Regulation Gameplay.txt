[00:00.000 --> 00:01.620]  Hey, welcome to another heist.
[00:02.880 --> 00:09.560]  We stopped and started right away. So we're still in heist mode. We got heist brain. We're ready.
[00:09.760 --> 00:13.160]  This is part three, part five of the heist.
[00:14.040 --> 00:15.640]  So enjoy this part.
[00:16.100 --> 00:20.800]  I mean, that's kind of accurate because this is the fifth heist and this is the third video of this heist.
[00:21.260 --> 00:24.280]  Right, that's why I said it's part three, part five. Right, you get it.
[00:25.420 --> 00:26.380]  Yeah, I get it.

[00:43.580 --> 00:45.840]  Crazy bugs. I don't like the crazy bugs. That's scary.
[00:46.900 --> 00:50.300]  Whoa, whoa, that's sick.
[00:51.060 --> 00:53.100]  Can't believe we're about to become everything we ever hated.
[00:53.840 --> 00:55.060]  Yep. Now we're cool.
[00:55.420 --> 00:57.300]  Riding motorcycles. Yep.
[01:00.580 --> 01:02.040]  I'm going to ride on the back with you, Nick.
[01:02.860 --> 01:04.440]  Hell yeah. Saddle up.
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.660]  Oh, no, wrong. Oh, wait, no, that's the right car.
[01:13.030 --> 01:14.830]  Gavin, you ready? Yeah, man.
[01:15.570 --> 01:21.530]  Roll out. Here we go.
[01:25.340 --> 01:27.980]  It is so hard to see. Oh, yeah.
[01:28.860 --> 01:31.000]  Is this part of like a Halloween thing still?
[01:31.260 --> 01:33.880]  It's November. It's almost December. Like what's going on?
[01:34.400 --> 01:35.740]  Oh, it's permanent Halloween mode.
[01:36.180 --> 01:37.600]  I was going to get snowy soon.
[01:38.680 --> 01:39.860]  Oh, yeah, it does that, huh?
[01:39.880 --> 01:40.800]  And you can like throw snowballs.
[01:41.880 --> 01:44.040]  That's fun. Oh, shit.
[01:44.120 --> 01:45.380]  What was the name of the, uh,
[01:46.060 --> 01:47.960]  what was the name of the biker in GTA 4?
[01:48.060 --> 01:48.860]  You think we're going to see him?
[01:50.120 --> 01:52.500]  Johnny. Johnny, is that his name?
[01:52.680 --> 01:55.840]  I think technically he would still be alive in this heist.
[01:56.220 --> 01:58.260]  Yes. In this heist, I think he is still alive.
[01:59.300 --> 02:01.060]  But not for long. Yeah.
[02:01.060 --> 02:03.900]  Ha ha. All right.
[02:06.280 --> 02:09.060]  Should we put your mask on? Mask on? Oh, yeah.
[02:10.320 --> 02:12.780]  Whoa. Oh, my God.
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.220]  Oh, no. That was crazy.
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.200]  What happened?
[02:16.820 --> 02:20.520]  A car hit me and it made our car like fly up in the air.
[02:23.160 --> 02:25.120]  Oh, this place is packed.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.640]  All right. Turns out it was private property.
[02:30.220 --> 02:32.100]  Hey, Nick died. I did. I was.
[02:32.460 --> 02:34.720]  Yeah. Gavin. Gavin, you're never going to believe what happened.
[02:35.080 --> 02:36.000]  Hey, Andrew also died.
[02:36.900 --> 02:39.580]  Snitch. You died before I did.
[02:39.620 --> 02:40.600]  I saw it. It told me.
[02:40.980 --> 02:43.080]  I don't know what part of snitch you didn't understand.
[02:44.380 --> 02:47.280]  I said snitch. And then your response was, yeah, I saw it.
[02:47.320 --> 02:48.480]  I told them. Yeah.
[02:49.200 --> 02:51.360]  Yeah. But I get to eat well tonight in the commissary.
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.960]  I was doing my best to throw you under the bus so I got out of trouble.
[02:54.240 --> 02:57.160]  Listen, I don't think you understand my relationship with the CEOs here.
[02:58.440 --> 03:00.160]  It definitely should have pinged me first.
[03:00.300 --> 03:01.680]  I was like, oh, fuck, I died before Nick.
[03:01.820 --> 03:02.920]  And then his name popped up.
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.220]  Should we try to go in silent or do you think I don't think it matters?
[03:07.320 --> 03:08.780]  I mean, we just got to go guns blazing.
[03:08.880 --> 03:10.560]  I just wasn't anticipating a gunfight.
[03:10.760 --> 03:12.940]  I didn't see anyone on the map.
[03:17.380 --> 03:21.060]  You know, when you're at a point when you're.
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.000]  No, my beauty.
[03:24.660 --> 03:26.360]  We have to drive there still, fellas.
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.620]  Do we? It's around the corner.
[03:28.620 --> 03:30.500]  We're right next to it.
[03:30.600 --> 03:32.640]  You can just use it around the corner.
[03:32.980 --> 03:34.420]  We could use the armored vehicle.
[03:35.020 --> 03:36.460]  Just classic double speed.
[03:37.820 --> 03:38.900]  Oh, my God, Nick.
[03:43.190 --> 03:44.450]  Oh, you've just parked.
[03:47.490 --> 03:47.930]  Yeah.
[03:50.250 --> 03:51.550]  I'm going to take a little detour.
[03:52.750 --> 03:54.110]  Yeah, I'll be right back.
[03:55.370 --> 03:57.010]  Just curious if it'll even let me do this.
[03:57.110 --> 03:57.990]  Oh, my God.
[03:57.990 --> 03:59.390]  That guy went into space,
[04:00.410 --> 04:02.050]  which I suppose is ironic.
[04:03.950 --> 04:04.670]  Good job.
[04:05.370 --> 04:05.810]  Wow.
[04:06.630 --> 04:07.650]  I won't let me in.
[04:09.850 --> 04:10.270]  Fuck.
[04:11.030 --> 04:12.810]  It sounds horrific in there.
[04:13.350 --> 04:15.130]  OK, I think I think we're good.
[04:15.450 --> 04:15.830]  Oh, shit.
[04:16.530 --> 04:16.970]  Jeez.
[04:17.310 --> 04:18.710]  Oh, wow. There's a lot of guys.
[04:18.830 --> 04:19.430]  Oh, boy.
[04:19.830 --> 04:20.930]  I'm just totally shit.
[04:20.970 --> 04:22.030]  There's a lot of them.
[04:22.190 --> 04:22.730]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[04:23.290 --> 04:24.350]  Suppressing, suppressing.
[04:24.610 --> 04:26.450]  Oh, I'm getting done in.
[04:28.890 --> 04:31.230]  Breaking the law, breaking the law, man.
[04:31.530 --> 04:34.670]  Oh, that deep weapon wheel shit is so good.
[04:36.490 --> 04:37.670]  Well, who died?
[04:39.710 --> 04:40.310]  You know what?
[04:40.530 --> 04:41.550]  That's on me.
[04:43.410 --> 04:46.390]  OK, that's a hundred percent.
[04:46.650 --> 04:49.450]  We've been we've been really we've been really finding out a 100 percent
[04:49.450 --> 04:54.230]  that Nick will fuck up and then immediately go, that's on me.
[04:54.410 --> 04:56.150]  Like it will be on anyone's responsibility.
[04:56.150 --> 04:58.370]  You know, I appreciate it.
[04:58.370 --> 05:01.230]  I, I, I lobbed a grenade and
[05:02.110 --> 05:03.390]  there's nothing wrong with accountability.
[05:03.870 --> 05:06.330]  Yeah, the guy who was just sat in the corner of the meeting,
[05:06.710 --> 05:10.030]  fiddling with a lighter and a stick of dynamite eventually says that's on me.
[05:10.210 --> 05:10.950]  Yeah, that's on me.
[05:11.170 --> 05:12.710]  Well, that is how it goes.
[05:12.950 --> 05:15.690]  It's every time we record is really it's shocking.
[05:16.130 --> 05:19.510]  I imagine he yells it very quickly and briefly.
[05:19.790 --> 05:21.170]  I'll take a little bit of blame, too.
[05:21.250 --> 05:23.650]  I drove over to the casino because I noticed we're next to it
[05:23.650 --> 05:25.250]  to see if it would let me spin the wheel.
[05:25.250 --> 05:28.230]  The daily wheel, and it would not let me in.
[05:28.290 --> 05:29.730]  So I was driving back to the scene.
[05:29.810 --> 05:30.550]  Let's take the armored car.
[05:30.870 --> 05:31.990]  Let's take the armored car. Yeah.
[05:32.290 --> 05:33.910]  What? It's right across the street.
[05:33.950 --> 05:35.110]  I'm already halfway there.
[05:35.210 --> 05:37.070]  It's going to stay in the armored car.
[05:37.310 --> 05:38.450]  I don't think he means to get there.
[05:38.530 --> 05:40.590]  I think he means to protect you.
[05:40.670 --> 05:42.310]  You know what? I support that plan.
[05:43.450 --> 05:44.250]  Jesus Christ.
[05:45.970 --> 05:47.990]  And yeah, it's not like I'm a lazy ass.
[05:48.030 --> 05:49.770]  It's more like I want to live.
[05:50.170 --> 05:51.570]  Die. Oh, my God.
[05:51.570 --> 05:54.710]  Oh, that was that was a move.
[05:58.670 --> 05:59.690]  Oh, I see.
[05:59.790 --> 06:01.490]  Now we're just sitting here rinsing them. Yeah.
[06:03.290 --> 06:08.110]  OK. Why does it keep trying to lock me on to this one fucking guy?
[06:08.490 --> 06:09.030]  There we go.
[06:10.390 --> 06:11.510]  People take a lot of bullets.
[06:11.670 --> 06:12.450]  Is this what we play on?
[06:12.630 --> 06:14.970]  Yeah, you got to you got to pull up and headshot.
[06:15.870 --> 06:17.130]  Yeah, yeah. Always headshot.
[06:17.730 --> 06:20.070]  Yeah. Sir, sir, sir.
[06:20.670 --> 06:23.270]  Well, from from inside an armored car, it's look.
[06:24.070 --> 06:25.910]  All right. I'm on. I'm on a bike.
[06:26.170 --> 06:28.530]  All right. Let's take a one right now.
[06:28.850 --> 06:30.410]  Am I? Is this the bike?
[06:31.010 --> 06:31.650]  I'm on one.
[06:33.110 --> 06:34.910]  I don't. Am I doing something wrong?
[06:35.070 --> 06:36.010]  There's trouble going off.
[06:36.870 --> 06:38.030]  I think you're on the wrong bike.
[06:38.590 --> 06:39.770]  I what the fuck?
[06:39.890 --> 06:41.250]  They're marked by a blue dot.
[06:41.670 --> 06:44.730]  Yeah, no, I grabbed the one that I thought was the blue dot.
[06:44.830 --> 06:45.590]  And I guess it wasn't.
[06:45.730 --> 06:47.310]  That was very strange. Shit.
[06:48.430 --> 06:49.450]  Oh, shut up.
[06:49.450 --> 06:50.690]  OK, now we're good.
[06:50.830 --> 06:51.790]  Shut up. Now we're good.
[06:52.310 --> 06:53.810]  All right. You got my tire?
[06:54.650 --> 06:55.650]  No, I shot a different time.
[06:55.730 --> 06:57.310]  Oh, OK. I'm dead. Sorry.
[06:58.550 --> 06:59.830]  The fight was over.
[07:00.910 --> 07:02.670]  You fucking you dunce.
[07:02.790 --> 07:05.190]  I was escaping and there's a million guys.
[07:05.250 --> 07:07.050]  Why did you leave without us?
[07:07.410 --> 07:09.010]  Because you want to go ahead.
[07:09.510 --> 07:12.370]  It's every man for himself in the team game.
[07:12.970 --> 07:14.870]  This is like playing left for dead.
[07:15.410 --> 07:16.750]  I didn't expect to get.
[07:17.290 --> 07:18.590]  I hopped on a bike.
[07:18.590 --> 07:20.210]  It said deliver the bike.
[07:20.230 --> 07:25.110]  I did the instructions and the feedback is why are you following the feedback?
[07:27.590 --> 07:29.150]  The fight was over.
[07:29.290 --> 07:31.270]  No, it wasn't. You just weren't in it.
[07:31.270 --> 07:33.850]  I'm very. We were waiting to leave together.
[07:34.750 --> 07:38.830]  So in the car, I didn't get that email where Andrew's the one that blew it and died.
[07:38.970 --> 07:40.070]  We're all wrong. Yeah.
[07:40.650 --> 07:43.210]  No, I'm saying I blew it and I died.
[07:43.250 --> 07:46.550]  But everything that you're saying is that we're about it is wrong.
[07:46.550 --> 07:48.830]  Yeah, I'm glad we all agree.
[07:48.930 --> 07:52.250]  I'm glad we I'm glad Gavin is wrong that there was no fight.
[07:52.770 --> 07:55.090]  Well, the and I was not in the wrong for following the objective.
[07:55.250 --> 07:57.570]  I was able to figure out what bike I was supposed to sit on.
[07:57.770 --> 07:59.150]  I guess I'm a genius. I'm sorry.
[07:59.930 --> 08:01.790]  Yeah, yeah, that's what we're saying.
[08:02.210 --> 08:05.310]  Andrew's a genius. Yeah, it was my fault.
[08:05.990 --> 08:07.770]  I was too good at detecting the bike.
[08:09.170 --> 08:10.250]  Are we going to use my car for cover?
[08:11.410 --> 08:14.570]  It's really I don't understand why you shoot him.
[08:15.330 --> 08:18.050]  All right. You can still get shot by them.
[08:18.390 --> 08:20.590]  We were shooting him. We shot him.
[08:20.770 --> 08:22.030]  We don't want to say I don't.
[08:22.290 --> 08:25.290]  You guys are acting like this car is the only way we can do this thing.
[08:25.330 --> 08:26.830]  We're really does not feel nice.
[08:26.930 --> 08:28.530]  It just means you can't be shot.
[08:28.710 --> 08:29.990]  Fun element to it.
[08:31.110 --> 08:33.110]  I disagree about the fun element. It is fun.
[08:35.610 --> 08:37.750]  Oh, you just slid a body into my screen.
[08:37.810 --> 08:41.330]  That was great. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Shit.
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.280]  I'm not sure where those guys are.
[08:47.920 --> 08:48.720]  They left and right.
[08:51.420 --> 08:53.620]  Where are they? Six feet under now.
[08:54.340 --> 08:55.820]  Nick, your car caught a few strays from you there.
[08:55.920 --> 08:58.000]  It's all right. It's armor proof.
[08:59.600 --> 09:00.780]  It's armor proof.
[09:00.780 --> 09:02.620]  What? Oh, it's armored.
[09:03.560 --> 09:06.060]  It's armor proof. No armor can get to it.
[09:06.300 --> 09:07.860]  So did everyone pick up their armor?
[09:08.460 --> 09:10.000]  And we're all going to leave together.
[09:10.540 --> 09:11.960]  Where's the other bike?
[09:12.680 --> 09:13.680]  Oh, there it is. Big blue dot.
[09:13.680 --> 09:15.940]  Oh, it was covered by your big blue dot.
[09:17.060 --> 09:18.380]  Are we all good? Yeah.
[09:18.540 --> 09:20.540]  All right. What is the art?
[09:20.760 --> 09:24.420]  It says like the left stick to use some kind of system.
[09:25.260 --> 09:25.700]  What is that?
[09:26.100 --> 09:29.000]  Is it like a boost? I think it's faster. It's like a boost. Oh.
[09:31.220 --> 09:32.400]  It is like a boost.
[09:33.700 --> 09:35.680]  Whoa. Austin.
[09:36.360 --> 09:37.160]  Hey, but there's no fight.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.540]  We're out of it. Holy shit.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.900]  I feel like you're missing the point of what I'm saying.
[09:41.900 --> 09:46.120]  I don't know where I don't know where you're supposed to go.
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.000]  Like what you run into is just a buzz saw.
[09:50.340 --> 09:52.360]  Yeah. Good thing there's no fight though.
[09:52.740 --> 09:54.620]  Right. Well, fight was back there.
[09:56.020 --> 09:57.140]  That's crazy.
[09:57.460 --> 10:02.080]  Should do we need to like dip down a street to like stay away from that?
[10:02.400 --> 10:05.540]  We could street dip. Yeah, we could absolutely do a little dip.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.900]  It is you just run into like that's just so much.
[10:10.900 --> 10:12.780]  I don't know what you're supposed to do.
[10:13.160 --> 10:13.560]  Sure.
[10:14.860 --> 10:18.120]  I don't I don't know that I could pull any shots off
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.240]  while trying to go as fast as you can in this thing.
[10:21.760 --> 10:24.760]  I just I don't know that I don't know that we can do that.
[10:25.120 --> 10:25.620]  It is tough.
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.500]  Maybe knowing the boost like we have that, it'll make it a bit easier to.
[10:30.780 --> 10:32.300]  I dude, I was I was boosting.
[10:32.420 --> 10:35.860]  That's why I was the first one to die, because I was way out ahead of you guys.
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.980]  That yeah, makes sense.
[10:38.820 --> 10:42.540]  What the what the hell?
[10:46.160 --> 10:48.360]  Oh, that was incredible.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.220]  But we're a little stuck, but oh, well, that looked awesome.
[11:00.720 --> 11:02.240]  They're on the roof this time.
[11:02.560 --> 11:03.460]  So are we.
[11:08.040 --> 11:09.140]  It's front wheel drive.
[11:09.280 --> 11:10.900]  Let me try to give you guys a little push.
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.620]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[11:16.620 --> 11:17.500]  Oh, God.
[11:20.880 --> 11:22.780]  Oh, nice, nice action roll.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.180]  Oh, there we go. Almost.
[11:25.640 --> 11:27.400]  Yeah. Oh, they're all dead.
[11:28.980 --> 11:29.940]  Now there's one more.
[11:31.580 --> 11:32.220]  Oh, sorry.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.840]  Got him. Got him.
[11:33.880 --> 11:35.240]  I almost shot myself in the head.
[11:36.960 --> 11:39.080]  I'm going to put my armor on and eat my snacks.
[11:39.480 --> 11:41.120]  Yeah, yeah, definitely. Armor up, fellas.
[11:41.700 --> 11:44.040]  Yeah, do that before we go, because, boy, there's...
[11:45.700 --> 11:46.500]  That's crazy.
[11:47.680 --> 11:48.420]  All right. Ready, everyone?
[11:48.680 --> 11:49.380]  Hold on, let's wait.
[11:50.220 --> 11:51.320]  No, no, we're good.
[11:51.580 --> 11:52.880]  All right, let's roll out.
[11:53.620 --> 11:55.560]  I just I just don't know.
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.780]  I don't know, guys.
[11:57.920 --> 11:59.800]  I don't know what it's like.
[12:00.220 --> 12:00.720]  Shot that guy.
[12:03.120 --> 12:05.620]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[12:06.720 --> 12:07.920]  Oh, this is going to reset.
[12:11.120 --> 12:11.980]  Gavin's dead. Gavin died.
[12:15.080 --> 12:18.060]  Gavin was looking backwards shooting people on my bike.
[12:18.280 --> 12:18.820]  Yeah, did that.
[12:19.080 --> 12:19.880]  Bad, bad in front.
[12:19.880 --> 12:21.240]  I don't think I don't think it's going to work for you.
[12:21.640 --> 12:22.300]  A van in front of me.
[12:24.560 --> 12:26.480]  Of all the places I could have parked the van, that was a good one.
[12:27.840 --> 12:28.660]  Good killing, Eric.
[12:29.960 --> 12:30.880]  It's like 13.
[12:31.620 --> 12:34.720]  It's the headshots, you just run up and just start pulling.
[12:35.580 --> 12:38.480]  Like when I get in a zone with this, it's like playing Red Dead One
[12:38.480 --> 12:40.840]  where it's just like, OK, this is like muscle memory.
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.080]  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.
[12:43.760 --> 12:45.780]  That's why I like the little carbine.
[12:46.220 --> 12:48.700]  I don't feel like I have to use a lot of bullets, but it's pretty strong.
[12:48.860 --> 12:50.620]  Yeah, pretty accurate, too.
[12:51.640 --> 12:54.520]  Yeah, I feel like when I when I pull it gets that headshot pretty well.
[12:57.660 --> 13:02.480]  I'm really enjoying running these fools over, it looks so good every time.
[13:11.390 --> 13:12.630]  Well, at least you enjoyed it.
[13:14.030 --> 13:15.070]  Guys in the front aren't dead.
[13:19.820 --> 13:21.380]  I'm running diversion tactics.
[13:22.380 --> 13:23.700]  You're doing it. I'm stuck.
[13:25.080 --> 13:26.900]  Is that part of the tactic? Oh, yeah.
[13:31.160 --> 13:32.600]  Oh, they shot through the car.
[13:38.250 --> 13:39.470]  Oh, what for that?
[13:39.810 --> 13:40.270]  What happened?
[13:41.650 --> 13:42.330]  Next time, fun.
[13:42.690 --> 13:44.830]  Eric got fucking leveled by a car.
[13:45.250 --> 13:48.490]  I don't know what like all of a sudden it was just like, you're on the ground.
[13:48.670 --> 13:49.730]  And it's like, why am I on the ground?
[13:51.290 --> 13:53.230]  It looks so funny.
[13:53.390 --> 13:54.810]  I went down hard.
[13:55.510 --> 13:57.330]  I went down hard.
[14:00.970 --> 14:02.670]  OK, I got a bike.
[14:06.010 --> 14:07.210]  Oh, shit, it's still a man.
[14:09.830 --> 14:10.710]  Yeah, on the bike.
[14:11.430 --> 14:12.830]  Oh, my God.
[14:13.290 --> 14:14.890]  He got eviscerated.
[14:15.570 --> 14:16.830]  He's still alive.
[14:16.950 --> 14:17.310]  Oh, what?
[14:18.750 --> 14:19.470]  There. OK.
[14:19.830 --> 14:20.090]  All right.
[14:20.170 --> 14:23.050]  I don't know. I don't know what we're supposed to do or do different,
[14:23.190 --> 14:24.050]  but I guess let's go.
[14:24.330 --> 14:26.710]  There's a dude who comes from the side here, so we'll shoot him as he comes up.
[14:26.870 --> 14:27.530]  I have a suggestion for Gavin.
[14:28.390 --> 14:29.130]  Watch out for the van.
[14:30.070 --> 14:31.510]  Don't drive right into the van.
[14:31.850 --> 14:32.050]  Ah!
[14:35.490 --> 14:37.110]  Oh, somebody threaded that needle.
[14:37.710 --> 14:38.110]  Yeah, it was me.
[14:38.330 --> 14:38.750]  I'm going to dip.
[14:38.870 --> 14:41.370]  I'm going to try to dip a street south.
[14:41.710 --> 14:42.170]  Holy shit.
[14:42.750 --> 14:43.250]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[14:44.610 --> 14:45.650]  Uh, it does not matter.
[14:45.990 --> 14:47.210]  Oh, shit, it sure doesn't.
[14:47.290 --> 14:47.610]  Ah!
[14:48.750 --> 14:49.230]  I'm dead.
[14:49.630 --> 14:50.750]  There's no way I'm going to live through this.
[14:51.850 --> 14:54.690]  Oh, wow. Oh, actually, where we have to go is not that far.
[14:55.190 --> 14:56.410]  Yeah, we're pretty much really close.
[14:57.990 --> 15:00.810]  I hit, I was trying to do something sneaky and I hit a wall.
[15:01.890 --> 15:03.590]  Where are we supposed to, are we going here?
[15:04.550 --> 15:05.010]  Is it in here?
[15:05.250 --> 15:05.450]  Ah!
[15:08.870 --> 15:10.610]  Ah, you dick!
[15:12.730 --> 15:13.450]  You twat.
[15:14.510 --> 15:15.810]  It can't be in here, is it?
[15:15.810 --> 15:17.830]  Oh, shit, I am so boned.
[15:18.370 --> 15:20.270]  What are, where are we supposed to go with this thing?
[15:20.770 --> 15:21.890]  This is going to be the next one.
[15:22.130 --> 15:23.110]  I don't know, I'm just trying to kill the guy.
[15:23.930 --> 15:24.850]  I don't understand.
[15:26.370 --> 15:28.250]  It says down? Where the fuck?
[15:28.530 --> 15:29.730]  Backing up, backing up.
[15:30.930 --> 15:31.930]  Did you find it, Gavin?
[15:32.390 --> 15:33.710]  I think so.
[15:34.290 --> 15:35.870]  I can't believe I'm alive.
[15:36.090 --> 15:37.130]  Oh, shit, spoke too soon.
[15:37.390 --> 15:38.490]  Yeah, I'm at it.
[15:38.730 --> 15:40.550]  Is it around the back?
[15:41.070 --> 15:42.750]  Oh, I see.
[15:43.010 --> 15:45.310]  Okay, we did it.
[15:47.830 --> 15:50.610]  Go down the alley around and it's to the back.
[15:51.010 --> 15:51.950]  Behind this building.
[15:52.690 --> 15:53.370]  Yeah, that's it.
[15:54.410 --> 15:55.470]  That scared me.
[15:59.730 --> 16:00.750]  I made it.
[16:00.790 --> 16:01.310]  Nice.
[16:01.810 --> 16:03.750]  That was a very weird mission.
[16:03.950 --> 16:05.190]  I shouldn't have made it.
[16:06.310 --> 16:07.490]  I'm glad you did.
[16:09.330 --> 16:11.110]  That was a very strange mission.
[16:11.470 --> 16:12.670]  So now we can rob a bank.
[16:13.050 --> 16:13.470]  Yay!
[16:16.770 --> 16:20.690]  Not a great sign when the getaway cars are like smoking due to David.
[16:23.030 --> 16:23.710]  Find them!
[16:31.940 --> 16:33.340]  These are the easy...
[16:33.340 --> 16:33.680]  Heists.
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.260]  Yeah, we've got more heists after, haven't we?
[16:37.740 --> 16:38.220]  We do.
[16:39.640 --> 16:43.500]  People seem to be really excited for us to do those other ones.
[16:43.920 --> 16:44.740]  Yeah, I hear they're hot.
[16:45.120 --> 16:46.780]  To get past the initial ones.
[16:47.020 --> 16:50.320]  Today is 26 degrees Celsius.
[16:52.460 --> 16:55.060]  On the 25th of November.
[16:56.100 --> 16:56.700]  That's pretty hot.
[16:57.260 --> 16:59.960]  Yeah, it's supposed to be like 80 today.
[17:00.400 --> 17:00.840]  79.
[17:02.860 --> 17:03.600]  Cool, man.
[17:04.300 --> 17:05.900]  Not to be pedantic, but I will.
[17:08.100 --> 17:09.720]  We've got a big drop tomorrow.
[17:11.560 --> 17:12.600]  And then...
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.340]  Back to 80 on Wednesday.
[17:15.220 --> 17:16.000]  And then...
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.560]  But then a big drop on Thursday.
[17:18.920 --> 17:19.680]  And it stays.
[17:20.160 --> 17:20.820]  Sorry about that.
[17:21.660 --> 17:23.160]  Anything else? What else is coming after that?
[17:24.000 --> 17:24.460]  I don't know.
[17:25.140 --> 17:25.380]  Christmas.
[17:27.220 --> 17:29.460]  What if we go into weekly weather for the podcast?
[17:29.460 --> 17:31.220]  Yeah, we're getting there.
[17:32.140 --> 17:34.140]  What if we do everyone's local weather?
[17:34.460 --> 17:35.460]  And it takes us like...
[17:36.640 --> 17:37.520]  A week.
[17:39.220 --> 17:40.740]  What if we do global weather?
[17:41.780 --> 17:42.420]  Oh, God.
[17:44.260 --> 17:45.480]  That'd just be the show.
[17:46.920 --> 17:48.260]  Under the regulation of weather.
[17:48.980 --> 17:51.060]  It's like a 24 hour livestream.
[17:51.760 --> 17:52.860]  City by city.
[17:54.020 --> 17:56.260]  And as soon as you reach the edge, you just start again.
[17:56.780 --> 17:57.040]  Yeah.
[17:58.760 --> 17:59.620]  Oh, fuck.
[17:59.700 --> 18:00.460]  They just said mine.
[18:00.540 --> 18:02.860]  I'm going to have to wait 36 hours to hear
[18:03.620 --> 18:05.080]  when it's going to rain next.
[18:05.840 --> 18:07.460]  I think I killed a pug by accident.
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.080]  There's pugs in this?
[18:12.940 --> 18:15.640]  Oh, that's the first time I've ever killed a pug
[18:15.640 --> 18:16.080]  in multiplayer.
[18:16.800 --> 18:17.380]  That's sad.
[18:18.720 --> 18:21.080]  I didn't like the specification of multiplayer.
[18:23.140 --> 18:25.320]  I wish you'd just left it at pug.
[18:25.920 --> 18:26.400]  Ow.
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.700]  Let's put down the rest of its misery.
[18:33.180 --> 18:34.080]  Hi, officer.
[18:35.880 --> 18:37.180]  Oh, my God.
[18:39.340 --> 18:40.240]  Let's cheese it.
[18:43.460 --> 18:45.260]  Just what I'd expect a rat to say.
[18:46.180 --> 18:46.460]  I died.
[18:47.280 --> 18:48.080]  Shit, I ate it.
[18:48.800 --> 18:50.600]  There's so much blood on this car.
[18:52.180 --> 18:53.440]  It's mostly human blood
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.160]  and a little bit of pug.
[18:54.720 --> 18:55.960]  Oh, I didn't bite.
[18:56.900 --> 18:57.440]  I'll be right there.
[18:57.540 --> 19:00.020]  Get me away from this dead pug.
[19:02.480 --> 19:03.600]  Let's blur out the dead pug.
[19:03.640 --> 19:04.100]  It was sad.
[19:04.760 --> 19:06.280]  He ain't going to be in Men in Black 5.
[19:08.740 --> 19:09.860]  I'm going to buy the armor right here.
[19:10.000 --> 19:10.320]  That's easy.
[19:12.320 --> 19:12.680]  Not bad.
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.880]  I had to restock my entire collection.
[19:16.740 --> 19:17.360]  Oh, good work.
[19:18.080 --> 19:18.660]  Here we go.
[19:19.100 --> 19:19.780]  This is it.
[19:19.780 --> 19:22.240]  This is the final heist of the base heist.
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.320]  This is it.
[19:24.360 --> 19:26.860]  You've got to rob the Pacific Standard Bank
[19:26.860 --> 19:27.840]  on Vinewood Boulevard.
[19:28.260 --> 19:29.340]  Oh, I can do that. That's easy.
[19:31.780 --> 19:33.400]  Man, you are bloody...
[19:33.400 --> 19:35.040]  Maybe Vinny Chanson will be in the bank.
[19:39.240 --> 19:39.680]  Chicago!
[19:41.920 --> 19:43.920]  So this ends up with us up north
[19:43.920 --> 19:45.900]  in the middle of nowhere
[19:45.900 --> 19:47.980]  getting on a boat with some bikes or something, right?
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.980]  You're the only one that's done this.
[19:50.040 --> 19:50.900]  I don't know why you're asking.
[19:51.340 --> 19:54.260]  I think it involves a giant kerfuffle at the end.
[19:54.500 --> 19:56.160]  One thing I do remember is
[19:56.160 --> 19:57.800]  the more damage you take,
[19:57.900 --> 19:59.120]  the more money you lose.
[20:00.620 --> 20:02.460]  And it's all about the money.
[20:02.460 --> 20:04.820]  Here it is. Keep it simple.
[20:04.980 --> 20:07.200]  You go in heavy, you go in well-armed.
[20:07.680 --> 20:09.140]  Some of you will do crowd control.
[20:09.300 --> 20:11.140]  The vault team will go downstairs.
[20:11.400 --> 20:12.860]  Go to the first vault door
[20:12.860 --> 20:14.120]  with the thermal charges.
[20:15.320 --> 20:17.200]  Nick loves explosions.
[20:17.820 --> 20:18.900]  No, I don't want to...
[20:18.900 --> 20:19.960]  I want to be on crowd control.
[20:21.360 --> 20:24.400]  Nothing gets Nick excited
[20:24.400 --> 20:25.180]  like thermal.
[20:27.480 --> 20:28.600]  All about that underwear.
[20:29.440 --> 20:31.480]  I want a compilation of all the people
[20:31.480 --> 20:32.760]  that Andrew's called Jake.
[20:41.120 --> 20:44.500]  Oh, Eric and I are in crowd control, baby.
[20:45.200 --> 20:46.520]  Gavin's doing demolition.
[20:46.820 --> 20:46.960]  Whoa.
[20:47.460 --> 20:49.360]  How do I adjust this?
[20:54.120 --> 20:55.780]  Giving everyone 25.
[20:56.080 --> 20:56.500]  Wow.
[20:57.260 --> 20:59.960]  I want Andrew to have 30. You can take my 5.
[21:01.280 --> 21:01.680]  Wow.
[21:04.960 --> 21:06.420]  It's smart to not do that
[21:06.420 --> 21:07.500]  because he's going to hold it over you.
[21:11.640 --> 21:13.720]  I'm worried about being a hacker, but it's fine.
[21:14.040 --> 21:15.660]  I'm qualified. I'll figure it out.
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.700]  I think you could hack. You probably do computers.
[21:19.040 --> 21:20.160]  I certainly use them.
[21:23.140 --> 21:24.240]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[21:25.420 --> 21:26.340]  the rat's on.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.400]  Rat's on, rat's off.
[21:30.480 --> 21:31.160]  I'm ready.
[21:31.580 --> 21:34.160]  I feel like that was really the key part
[21:34.160 --> 21:35.220]  of the outfit that I bought.
[21:35.860 --> 21:38.000]  You've got to save it as an owned outfit.
[21:38.440 --> 21:38.960]  Oh, okay.
[21:41.600 --> 21:42.480]  All right.
[21:43.500 --> 21:44.660]  Nick, I'll ride with you, yeah?
[21:44.880 --> 21:45.180]  Yeah.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  I think we have to get the bikes anyway, right?
[21:50.280 --> 21:51.660]  Where do we run to them later?
[21:52.260 --> 21:54.380]  Should we all go out in Austin with heist bags
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.720]  like this and see if anyone...
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.000]  Yeah, just see what happens.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.860]  Not the minigun and stuff, but just the bag.
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.380]  You have a minigun?
[22:03.980 --> 22:04.880]  That's a yes.
[22:05.140 --> 22:06.080]  That laugh was a yes.
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.680]  Oh man, that felt very...
[22:08.680 --> 22:09.140]  Excuse me?
[22:11.800 --> 22:13.260]  You have a flamethrower though, don't you?
[22:13.680 --> 22:14.400]  I did.
[22:17.180 --> 22:17.840]  Lost it.
[22:18.480 --> 22:18.720]  What?
[22:19.100 --> 22:22.420]  That's not the kind of thing you should lose.
[22:23.420 --> 22:23.720]  No.
[22:23.720 --> 22:23.760]  Oh.
[22:25.300 --> 22:25.900]  God damn.
[22:32.500 --> 22:32.900]  Okay.
[22:34.700 --> 22:35.420]  All right.
[22:37.860 --> 22:39.740]  Should we go in without stuff in our hands?
[22:40.700 --> 22:42.000]  Yeah, I think so.
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.760]  Should we have a huddle before we go in?
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.940]  Nope, too late. No huddle, we're in.
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.000]  Okay.
[22:51.240 --> 22:53.140]  I took the stuff out of my hands and handed it to Nick.
[22:53.140 --> 22:56.640]  Are we just robbing the ATMs first?
[22:57.260 --> 22:57.380]  Yeah.
[22:57.640 --> 22:58.840]  We're gonna get little money.
[22:58.980 --> 23:00.100]  Everybody's lunches.
[23:01.380 --> 23:02.640]  Ham and cheese.
[23:03.080 --> 23:05.060]  All right, rats on baby.
[23:05.220 --> 23:06.260]  Oh shit.
[23:08.400 --> 23:09.160]  All right, Nick.
[23:09.460 --> 23:11.140]  Let's go, control that crowd.
[23:11.300 --> 23:12.000]  Everybody down.
[23:13.940 --> 23:14.940]  Everybody down.
[23:15.160 --> 23:16.120]  Get fucking down.
[23:16.400 --> 23:19.340]  I just threw a C4 on the fucking light fixture.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.460]  I didn't mean to do that.
[23:20.980 --> 23:22.120]  Remember, don't kill people,
[23:22.300 --> 23:23.400]  but keep them scared.
[23:25.080 --> 23:26.380]  I'm Sam Fisher.
[23:26.700 --> 23:28.320]  Hey, but don't shoot the light
[23:28.320 --> 23:29.780]  that has the C4 on it.
[23:29.800 --> 23:30.320]  Oh, Jesus.
[23:34.280 --> 23:34.960]  Am I still demo?
[23:35.980 --> 23:36.860]  Yeah, I think so.
[23:37.340 --> 23:38.960]  Go, go, go.
[23:40.840 --> 23:41.440]  Stay down.
[23:42.220 --> 23:44.520]  You put that phone over there, you son of a bitch.
[23:46.860 --> 23:47.840]  Oh, I've thermited it.
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.960]  Good.
[23:50.980 --> 23:52.980]  The gate's gonna come open soon.
[24:00.480 --> 24:01.920]  First gate's done.
[24:02.060 --> 24:02.440]  Let's go.
[24:03.660 --> 24:04.860]  Guns on the tellers.
[24:05.920 --> 24:06.820]  Doing the second gate.
[24:07.540 --> 24:08.340]  This is like payday.
[24:09.300 --> 24:10.640]  Everybody chill out.
[24:12.080 --> 24:14.020]  I'm a hacker, but I have a gun.
[24:15.260 --> 24:15.620]  Andrew,
[24:15.780 --> 24:17.700]  are you on crowd control or are you with Gavin?
[24:18.180 --> 24:20.280]  I'm supposed to be with Gavin, but I'm just waiting.
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.400]  I gotta wait for the thing to open.
[24:22.080 --> 24:23.920]  Do you guys have a meter for the crowd?
[24:24.280 --> 24:25.500]  It says intimidation.
[24:26.760 --> 24:28.340]  Go to the vault control panel.
[24:28.560 --> 24:29.420]  It needs to go up.
[24:29.480 --> 24:30.740]  We need to intimidate more, Nick.
[24:32.280 --> 24:34.120]  Guards! More guards downstairs!
[24:34.720 --> 24:35.720]  Where's the panel?
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.040]  Where are these guys?
[24:38.220 --> 24:39.400]  Just waiting downstairs.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  I gotta go down, I guess?
[24:41.000 --> 24:41.300]  It's okay.
[24:41.960 --> 24:42.800]  On my way.
[24:45.300 --> 24:46.920]  Oh, that guy got riddled.
[24:47.220 --> 24:48.680]  Can we keep him covered?
[24:50.540 --> 24:50.980]  Hacking it.
[24:52.140 --> 24:53.820]  So how do I hack these things again?
[24:54.400 --> 24:54.960]  What do I gotta do?
[24:55.820 --> 24:57.360]  You gotta play, like, pipe dream or something?
[24:57.920 --> 24:58.400]  I don't know.
[25:00.500 --> 25:00.980]  Okay.
[25:01.640 --> 25:02.500]  This is...
[25:02.500 --> 25:04.540]  I'm just walking back and forth,
[25:04.720 --> 25:06.680]  shooting my pistol in the air.
[25:06.960 --> 25:08.720]  This is the craziest shit.
[25:09.160 --> 25:10.800]  Oh, I blew the thing!
[25:11.400 --> 25:12.620]  Why did you do that?
[25:12.840 --> 25:14.260]  I just aimed up and fired!
[25:14.840 --> 25:16.120]  He blew the C4. Did anyone die?
[25:16.620 --> 25:18.940]  No, it's just walking back and forth. Really cool, actually.
[25:19.340 --> 25:19.700]  Oh, shit!
[25:19.980 --> 25:20.500]  There's guards!
[25:22.700 --> 25:24.920]  Alright, grab the frickin' money, let's go!
[25:25.960 --> 25:26.560]  I'll get that guy.
[25:27.540 --> 25:28.840]  Wait, while the vault gate is open.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.460]  Uh-oh! Uh-oh, Nick, we're losing intimidation!
[25:31.700 --> 25:33.440]  I'll kill this guy, you get the intimidation.
[25:34.160 --> 25:34.640]  Oh, shit!
[25:34.800 --> 25:35.880]  No, no, we can't!
[25:37.100 --> 25:38.720]  There's a guard on the map still.
[25:39.060 --> 25:39.500]  Yup.
[25:40.440 --> 25:41.580]  Okay, we're back, we're back.
[25:42.280 --> 25:43.080]  Alright, there we go.
[25:45.480 --> 25:46.620]  Alright, everyone get downstairs.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.280]  No, it still says control the crowd.
[25:49.720 --> 25:50.860]  No, it still says control the crowd.
[25:51.260 --> 25:52.320]  Grab the cash!
[25:52.820 --> 25:53.800]  Start grabbing it!
[25:56.920 --> 25:57.820]  Give me this cash.
[25:58.260 --> 25:58.380]  Uh-oh.
[25:58.840 --> 26:00.460]  Get all the cash you can carry.
[26:00.840 --> 26:01.780]  Keep doing it, boys.
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.800]  It's because I'm grabbing it.
[26:03.900 --> 26:04.640]  You grab cash.
[26:04.760 --> 26:07.140]  I was first!
[26:07.260 --> 26:08.140]  Keep grabbing it!
[26:08.560 --> 26:10.820]  He hasn't grabbed any, I'm almost done.
[26:11.340 --> 26:12.660]  Gavin, grab crash!
[26:13.140 --> 26:13.540]  Grab crash!
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.040]  Get the bandicoot!
[26:16.420 --> 26:17.540]  Grab grass!
[26:19.380 --> 26:20.580]  Grabbing all my crash!
[26:23.160 --> 26:24.700]  Keep getting money!
[26:25.620 --> 26:27.040]  I don't think I've ever grabbed the cash.
[26:27.740 --> 26:30.060]  It comes to me grabbing the cash seven years ago.
[26:30.060 --> 26:32.400]  I don't think I've ever done this.
[26:33.640 --> 26:35.580]  Oh, you guys are... yeah!
[26:36.220 --> 26:37.660]  Yeah, now we're looking good.
[26:37.720 --> 26:38.460]  We're looking good, boys.
[26:39.900 --> 26:41.100]  There's gotta be more than this.
[26:42.180 --> 26:43.300]  I'm controlling the crowd!
[26:47.510 --> 26:49.290]  Okay, we gotta regroup near the bank exit.
[26:49.830 --> 26:50.830]  Where are the bearer bonds?
[26:52.170 --> 26:53.090]  To the front, to the front!
[26:54.730 --> 26:55.330]  Let's go!
[26:56.310 --> 26:57.630]  I'm here, you ready?
[26:58.030 --> 26:59.610]  We're gonna have to book it as soon as we're out.
[26:59.610 --> 27:00.750]  Wait to regroup.
[27:01.350 --> 27:02.130]  Waiting on Gavin.
[27:02.490 --> 27:05.130]  Anytime you wanna get here.
[27:05.630 --> 27:06.890]  We're just hanging out.
[27:06.990 --> 27:08.150]  Armor up if you need it.
[27:08.390 --> 27:08.990]  Anytime.
[27:12.530 --> 27:13.730]  Hurry up!
[27:14.130 --> 27:16.690]  I'm gonna check my debit account real quick.
[27:17.370 --> 27:18.590]  Alright, here we go.
[27:19.130 --> 27:21.390]  It actually put me in!
[27:21.830 --> 27:22.970]  Oh no!
[27:24.450 --> 27:25.550]  There we go, we're fine.
[27:26.970 --> 27:28.730]  Why would we go out the front door?
[27:28.730 --> 27:29.810]  That's insane.
[27:30.490 --> 27:31.830]  Do a lot of banks have a back door?
[27:33.070 --> 27:35.110]  There's gotta be something that's not just this.
[27:35.370 --> 27:37.190]  I mean, to be to code, I would assume so.
[27:38.230 --> 27:39.850]  Oh my god, for real?
[27:40.770 --> 27:42.210]  Oh, you're just running out?
[27:42.630 --> 27:44.210]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[27:44.350 --> 27:45.170]  Are you crazy?
[27:46.470 --> 27:47.230]  You're just running?
[27:47.690 --> 27:48.090]  Yes!
[27:48.810 --> 27:51.650]  I thought we were gonna take out some cops first.
[27:52.490 --> 27:53.070]  Fuck no!
[27:55.230 --> 27:56.190]  Armor and snacks!
[27:56.190 --> 27:57.210]  Armor and snacks!
[27:58.570 --> 27:58.930]  Ow!
[28:02.370 --> 28:04.030]  Go, go, go, go!
[28:06.610 --> 28:07.570]  Clearing, I'm clearing, I'm clearing!
[28:08.150 --> 28:08.650]  Got him!
[28:11.950 --> 28:12.670]  Oh shit!
[28:13.570 --> 28:15.110]  Get health, get health, get health!
[28:17.190 --> 28:18.950]  Jesus Christ, there's so many of them!
[28:19.970 --> 28:20.770]  It's like heat!
[28:21.310 --> 28:22.170]  Just go, just go, just go!
[28:26.270 --> 28:27.730]  They'll train the police with this!
[28:27.950 --> 28:29.310]  What the fuck, it's so far!
[28:29.570 --> 28:32.710]  Oh, the helicopter just gave up!
[28:32.710 --> 28:34.370]  How are we still not there?
[28:34.450 --> 28:35.590]  We're almost there, keep going!
[28:36.410 --> 28:38.770]  Why did we park our escape vehicle
[28:38.770 --> 28:40.310]  eight blocks away?
[28:40.570 --> 28:41.530]  No, who died?
[28:41.730 --> 28:42.230]  Are we okay?
[28:46.190 --> 28:47.830]  So how much was in your account?
[28:48.290 --> 28:49.510]  Oh, I got root beer in my eye.
[28:51.570 --> 28:54.250]  I took a swig and it shot out of the can.
[28:56.190 --> 28:56.330]  Oh!
[28:58.150 --> 28:58.950]  Okay, I'm okay.
[28:59.890 --> 29:01.150]  Was it birch beer?
[29:02.410 --> 29:03.590]  I wasn't, it's a bark.
[29:05.970 --> 29:06.730]  If only.
[29:09.690 --> 29:12.050]  So I do think running and gunning is the way to go.
[29:12.130 --> 29:13.630]  I don't think waiting is...
[29:13.630 --> 29:14.230]  No, you're right.
[29:15.010 --> 29:17.690]  I think you should just go straight instead of going left.
[29:18.450 --> 29:20.550]  We have to go to the yellow markers.
[29:20.970 --> 29:21.410]  Yeah, I know.
[29:22.110 --> 29:22.510]  Oh, well.
[29:22.510 --> 29:22.910]  Got me!
[29:24.470 --> 29:26.030]  Alright, one more time, boys!
[29:26.350 --> 29:27.470]  One more time!
[29:28.750 --> 29:30.890]  The grenade from my grenade launcher
[29:30.890 --> 29:32.010]  binged off the door
[29:32.010 --> 29:33.070]  and landed right by my feet.
[29:39.290 --> 29:40.550]  The door just swung
[29:41.110 --> 29:41.930]  back around.
[29:45.810 --> 29:47.350]  What are we doing, masterminds?
[29:48.510 --> 29:49.490]  Criminal masterminds?
[29:52.890 --> 29:53.990]  Going! Go, go, go!
[29:57.860 --> 30:00.280]  I'm not even equipping a weapon right now, I'm just going speed.
[30:03.740 --> 30:06.020]  Being able to put armor on so quick feels like cheating.
[30:06.760 --> 30:07.160]  Yeah. Ow!
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.520]  The back of my damn head.
[30:11.280 --> 30:12.740]  Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.620]  Come on, come on, come on!
[30:21.700 --> 30:22.900]  Gavin committed suicide!
[30:22.900 --> 30:27.360]  He fired a rocket into your back!
[30:27.620 --> 30:29.540]  That was a wild time for Eric to run across me.
[30:30.540 --> 30:33.360]  I thought that it didn't have friendly fire, why didn't it just go through me?
[30:33.480 --> 30:34.880]  It still has suicide, though.
[30:35.060 --> 30:36.340]  It didn't kill you, it killed me.
[30:37.300 --> 30:38.020]  That is true.
[30:38.220 --> 30:40.100]  I blew up on you and killed him.
[30:41.640 --> 30:46.140]  I had such an open line to those police cars for so long and then you just...
[30:46.800 --> 30:47.760]  Ran right across.
[30:54.420 --> 30:54.900]  Uncled.
[30:55.380 --> 30:55.860]  Going!
[31:00.200 --> 31:00.680]  God!
[31:02.280 --> 31:03.260]  Nick, look out!
[31:08.080 --> 31:10.160]  You just bounced off the wall outside.
[31:12.400 --> 31:14.220]  I think somebody got in front of Nick.
[31:14.460 --> 31:15.480]  Yeah, I think it was Eric.
[31:15.480 --> 31:17.340]  Eric, uncled you as well.
[31:19.360 --> 31:22.800]  Now all I have to do is get in front of Andrew and I got the trifecta.
[31:23.240 --> 31:26.440]  I put my gun away to sprint across the street, so good luck.
[31:27.440 --> 31:31.540]  Nick, I really like this plan, though, of getting those cars to the left.
[31:31.600 --> 31:32.900]  Are you going to get the left one or the right one?
[31:32.960 --> 31:33.620]  I'll get the right one.
[31:34.040 --> 31:38.280]  I have an idea.
[31:38.820 --> 31:39.700]  Gavin got it, I guess.
[31:40.860 --> 31:42.560]  Hey, you almost got it, buddy!
[31:42.560 --> 31:44.560]  God damn it!
[31:48.040 --> 31:49.460]  My cash bags!
[31:49.760 --> 31:51.140]  Alright, Gavin, get him.
[31:51.280 --> 31:52.300]  Andrew, you're getting riddled.
[31:53.160 --> 31:56.300]  Oh, it's the hill. I've got to aim down.
[31:57.760 --> 31:58.980]  Oh, God in heaven!
[32:00.220 --> 32:01.260]  Watch out!
[32:02.140 --> 32:02.660]  Nice!
[32:03.680 --> 32:04.560]  Good shot.
[32:05.360 --> 32:06.360]  Let's do it. Keep moving.
[32:08.660 --> 32:10.240]  My God, he's just laying there.
[32:10.240 --> 32:11.100]  Taking it.
[32:11.460 --> 32:12.200]  Not anymore.
[32:14.300 --> 32:15.280]  Oh, shit!
[32:15.520 --> 32:16.720]  Oh, God!
[32:18.140 --> 32:19.560]  Watch your health.
[32:20.040 --> 32:22.240]  Oh, Eric again.
[32:22.480 --> 32:24.960]  There you go.
[32:28.960 --> 32:30.760]  Oh, my God, I don't want to hear you breathe.
[32:31.320 --> 32:35.880]  Got him.
[32:37.840 --> 32:39.440]  Hey, Nick.
[32:39.440 --> 32:41.220]  That 100%?
[32:41.380 --> 32:42.020]  Not on me, dude.
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.340]  That's on you. 100%.
[32:45.340 --> 32:46.220]  I'll take that.
[32:46.720 --> 32:47.800]  I'm going to run out of ammo here.
[32:48.260 --> 32:51.940]  I think it's crazy to use the rocket launcher at that point right there.
[32:52.040 --> 32:52.680]  That's nuts.
[32:53.040 --> 32:55.420]  That was fucking nuts.
[32:57.160 --> 32:57.640]  Yeah.
[32:58.680 --> 33:01.060]  I at least saw the bikes in our mini-map.
[33:01.280 --> 33:01.840]  We're close.
[33:02.180 --> 33:02.780]  That was nice.
[33:03.840 --> 33:07.760]  I was just sprinting with my weapon screen up, eating sandwiches.
[33:11.480 --> 33:13.100]  Just stuffing your little face.
[33:14.120 --> 33:15.260]  All right, here we go.
[33:17.880 --> 33:18.900]  Speed, speed, speed.
[33:19.420 --> 33:20.140]  Left side.
[33:20.420 --> 33:20.780]  Good shot.
[33:21.380 --> 33:21.980]  Thank you.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.700]  Right side. Good. Let's go.
[33:23.760 --> 33:24.160]  Keep moving.
[33:26.060 --> 33:27.440]  God, Andrew, you're gone.
[33:28.720 --> 33:28.960]  Yep.
[33:30.600 --> 33:31.520]  One for all.
[33:31.960 --> 33:32.700]  All right, Gavin, you got it?
[33:34.080 --> 33:35.940]  Hey, Gavin?
[33:37.160 --> 33:37.960]  Hey, Gavin?
[33:37.960 --> 33:38.820]  What happened?
[33:39.800 --> 33:41.980]  The path wasn't completely clear.
[33:42.720 --> 33:44.440]  Oh. Who was in the way of the path?
[33:45.000 --> 33:45.960]  Ooh, that'd be Nick.
[33:47.260 --> 33:47.620]  Interesting.
[33:48.420 --> 33:49.400]  Right in the middle there.
[33:49.540 --> 33:50.580]  One for all, but never the problem.
[33:52.120 --> 33:52.700]  It's true.
[33:52.940 --> 33:54.600]  I gotta give it to you, Andrew. You're totally right.
[33:57.080 --> 33:57.760]  Sorry, Gavin.
[33:58.300 --> 33:58.880]  Two blocks away.
[34:00.420 --> 34:01.600]  Hello, Smee, my boy.
[34:02.280 --> 34:02.620]  Uh-oh.
[34:02.840 --> 34:04.140]  Bite him. Bite the fuck out of him.
[34:05.340 --> 34:06.060]  Yeah, bite him.
[34:06.060 --> 34:06.820]  Yeah, yeah, bite Smee.
[34:07.140 --> 34:07.860]  Yeah, bite Smee.
[34:08.700 --> 34:14.160]  Oh, we both shot that one.
[34:14.440 --> 34:14.800]  Sorry.
[34:16.900 --> 34:17.660]  I got that one.
[34:17.780 --> 34:18.560]  There you go. You got it.
[34:20.500 --> 34:20.860]  Ow.
[34:20.900 --> 34:22.100]  All right, Gavin, you in front? You got it?
[34:22.540 --> 34:25.200]  I'm not in front, but I'm about to launch.
[34:27.500 --> 34:28.140]  Clear out.
[34:29.020 --> 34:29.380]  Nice.
[34:29.980 --> 34:30.480]  Move up.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.320]  Why are you so far back?
[34:32.840 --> 34:34.040]  Who? You.
[34:34.780 --> 34:36.620]  I gotta slow down to fire
[34:36.620 --> 34:37.460]  the damn thing, fool.
[34:41.020 --> 34:42.680]  Oh, shit. Uh-oh.
[34:42.980 --> 34:44.580]  Eric, there's a guy shooting you to your left.
[34:45.120 --> 34:46.180]  Yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter.
[34:47.360 --> 34:48.600]  Andrew was out in front,
[34:48.800 --> 34:50.500]  but this time he might have been the problem.
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.620]  You know what? I was using the RPG. I tried to switch
[34:52.620 --> 34:54.400]  up my strategy to get in on the mix, and
[34:54.820 --> 34:55.580]  not a good idea.
[34:56.180 --> 34:58.740]  I think everything you were doing before getting in on the mix
[34:58.740 --> 34:59.720]  was doing really good, though.
[35:00.680 --> 35:02.600]  I think you trying to get in on the mix might have been
[35:02.600 --> 35:04.700]  rough. Your contribution
[35:04.700 --> 35:06.440]  to the previous mix was doing really good.
[35:06.800 --> 35:08.940]  You were like the salt on the glass. It was perfect.
[35:09.340 --> 35:10.720]  Yeah. Wasn't the main
[35:10.720 --> 35:12.300]  ingredient, but it was pretty good.
[35:12.380 --> 35:13.920]  I'm going to the original trail. That's what I'm doing.
[35:17.020 --> 35:18.440]  Oh, God. I'm getting the one on the left.
[35:18.740 --> 35:19.620]  Left is down.
[35:22.660 --> 35:22.980]  Missed.
[35:23.120 --> 35:23.700]  All right, here we go.
[35:24.240 --> 35:26.240]  Got it. Away. Let's do it.
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.360]  Double got it.
[35:27.560 --> 35:30.160]  All right, Gavin, move way up and get up there.
[35:35.630 --> 35:36.710]  There you go.
[35:41.250 --> 35:41.870]  Oh, boy.
[35:42.670 --> 35:43.670]  You going to take it or what?
[35:43.770 --> 35:45.270]  There you go. Shoot this guy.
[35:45.850 --> 35:46.210]  Got him.
[35:53.590 --> 35:54.870]  Keep moving, Nick. Keep moving.
[35:55.530 --> 35:57.450]  I got to kill the people before they kill Gavin.
[35:58.790 --> 35:59.510]  Oh, shit.
[35:59.730 --> 36:00.990]  That was too close for me to shoot.
[36:03.110 --> 36:04.110]  Oh, my God.
[36:04.190 --> 36:04.730]  Oh, fuck.
[36:06.150 --> 36:07.690]  I'm seeing what he's talking about.
[36:09.310 --> 36:10.610]  Go, go, go, go.
[36:10.730 --> 36:11.590]  Let's go.
[36:12.370 --> 36:14.330]  The chopper's dropping cops.
[36:14.670 --> 36:15.530]  Oh, no.
[36:17.710 --> 36:18.790]  Chopper, dropper.
[36:18.890 --> 36:20.350]  Oh, my God.
[36:20.550 --> 36:22.450]  The helicopter landed on me.
[36:24.290 --> 36:26.430]  It landed on me.
[36:26.950 --> 36:29.470]  Good shot.
[36:29.470 --> 36:30.890]  I'm at the bikes.
[36:31.070 --> 36:32.050]  Yeah, we're coming.
[36:32.150 --> 36:32.770]  Armor up.
[36:35.330 --> 36:37.070]  There you go.
[36:37.270 --> 36:38.130]  Waiting for you guys.
[36:40.710 --> 36:41.790]  We're around the corner.
[36:42.190 --> 36:43.830]  Did you really get hit by the chopper?
[36:44.090 --> 36:45.350]  Yes, it landed on me.
[36:45.570 --> 36:46.150]  That's great.
[36:49.410 --> 36:50.090]  Let's go.
[36:51.510 --> 36:53.230]  Where are we supposed to go?
[37:00.220 --> 37:01.020]  Oh, guys.
[37:01.020 --> 37:02.920]  Everybody hit him.
[37:03.940 --> 37:05.660]  Where are we supposed to go?
[37:06.880 --> 37:07.680]  Okay, go.
[37:08.780 --> 37:09.740]  Let's go.
[37:10.660 --> 37:12.040]  Hit the boosts.
[37:12.120 --> 37:12.700]  I'm boosting.
[37:14.300 --> 37:15.860]  Careful on the boosts up here, though.
[37:15.900 --> 37:16.940]  We're going to get in winding hills.
[37:17.200 --> 37:18.220]  Hell, yeah, son.
[37:23.440 --> 37:25.560]  Is that one of those British songs?
[37:25.700 --> 37:26.260]  I don't know that one.
[37:26.260 --> 37:28.500]  Uh-oh.
[37:29.040 --> 37:29.540]  Block.
[37:35.310 --> 37:37.030]  Thanks for taking that out, boys.
[37:38.230 --> 37:39.230]  Appreciate it.
[37:40.050 --> 37:42.530]  I'm getting lit the fuck up.
[37:43.010 --> 37:44.510]  Man, I've already lost 200 grand.
[37:44.610 --> 37:45.390]  I can't believe it.
[37:45.770 --> 37:46.650]  See you over there.
[37:49.790 --> 37:51.450]  You and me, Andrew. Straight through the middle.
[37:52.310 --> 37:53.210]  Oh, no.
[37:53.650 --> 37:54.430]  He pinched me.
[37:54.430 --> 37:56.130]  He pinched me.
[37:56.370 --> 37:57.170]  Andrew died.
[37:57.690 --> 37:58.850]  He pinched it.
[38:01.810 --> 38:03.750]  I genuinely got pinched.
[38:05.110 --> 38:06.710]  You didn't go with me.
[38:08.090 --> 38:09.750]  I threaded the other needle.
[38:09.970 --> 38:12.290]  I was already committed to that hole when you said,
[38:12.550 --> 38:14.450]  let's do the middle, but I was already on the left.
[38:14.550 --> 38:16.310]  And then they pinched my bike.
[38:17.490 --> 38:19.290]  So the bike stopped and you just kept going?
[38:19.510 --> 38:23.190]  Yes, they jammed it against the wall and I flew off the front of it.
[38:23.190 --> 38:24.010]  And they killed me.
[38:24.910 --> 38:26.250]  I think we're starting on bikes.
[38:26.390 --> 38:27.090]  Oh, thank God.
[38:27.450 --> 38:29.730]  Do we have different amounts of money?
[38:29.890 --> 38:33.490]  I got 1.6 now from all the loss.
[38:34.010 --> 38:34.150]  Let's see.
[38:38.490 --> 38:39.330]  Anytime now.
[38:43.410 --> 38:44.370]  1.5.
[38:44.930 --> 38:45.970]  Oh, 1.5.
[38:46.450 --> 38:47.610]  That's our combined amount.
[38:48.270 --> 38:49.250]  I believe that's right.
[38:49.250 --> 38:50.390]  Yeah, that's correct.
[38:53.490 --> 38:55.150]  Dying really takes a cut.
[38:55.730 --> 38:55.890]  Yep.
[38:56.630 --> 38:57.590]  Let's not do it again.
[38:59.470 --> 39:00.690]  That's on me, because I died.
[39:05.360 --> 39:05.680]  Boost?
[39:06.640 --> 39:07.920]  Let's try to stick together more.
[39:09.220 --> 39:10.940]  I don't know if that's going to matter.
[39:11.340 --> 39:12.260]  We can try.
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.700]  It just means when someone falls off that you don't get reamed.
[39:16.540 --> 39:18.460]  I think it would have happened no matter what.
[39:18.700 --> 39:18.940]  Yeah.
[39:21.480 --> 39:22.940]  Uh-oh.
[39:23.380 --> 39:24.500]  Fuck you!
[39:24.860 --> 39:26.520]  This cop is crazy!
[39:26.820 --> 39:27.600]  That was awesome!
[39:27.980 --> 39:30.680]  He tried to pin you to that wall!
[39:31.480 --> 39:32.400]  Oh, shit!
[39:34.680 --> 39:36.620]  That was real cool, Nick.
[39:38.240 --> 39:40.500]  This is crazy.
[39:43.720 --> 39:45.900]  Oh, Gavin!
[39:46.440 --> 39:48.440]  That was pretty cool.
[39:53.420 --> 39:54.620]  Oh, look out!
[39:55.400 --> 39:55.920]  Barricade's coming!
[40:01.450 --> 40:02.970]  Who's furthest back?
[40:03.030 --> 40:03.390]  That was me.
[40:04.230 --> 40:05.810]  Uh-oh.
[40:09.830 --> 40:11.110]  Uh-oh.
[40:11.270 --> 40:11.590]  Hey, now.
[40:12.750 --> 40:14.170]  I got reamed.
[40:14.910 --> 40:15.650]  We're good.
[40:17.010 --> 40:17.990]  We're in business.
[40:19.250 --> 40:19.870]  Remember to boost.
[40:21.370 --> 40:22.110]  Hold Y to boost.
[40:23.630 --> 40:25.110]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[40:25.110 --> 40:25.510]  Oops!
[40:30.930 --> 40:31.810]  What happened?
[40:32.550 --> 40:33.170]  Just got shot.
[40:35.770 --> 40:38.750]  Is there a quick heal or anything?
[40:38.910 --> 40:40.070]  Like when we're on the bike or no?
[40:40.170 --> 40:40.870]  I don't know that.
[40:41.990 --> 40:43.730]  You might be able to have the snack open.
[40:44.850 --> 40:45.310]  What's that?
[40:45.790 --> 40:47.650]  Hold select and go into your snacks.
[40:48.010 --> 40:50.630]  Oh, so there's not a quick mode in that.
[40:50.630 --> 40:52.910]  You just have it on screen.
[40:53.650 --> 40:53.990]  Oh, okay.
[40:54.190 --> 40:55.430]  I'll just keep it open, then.
[41:00.210 --> 41:01.730]  What's our money count going to be now?
[41:02.310 --> 41:04.110]  I'm going to say 1.42.
[41:06.130 --> 41:07.010]  1.46.
[41:08.890 --> 41:09.570]  Oh, man.
[41:10.510 --> 41:12.130]  We've got to stop failing.
[41:14.990 --> 41:15.730]  Let's do it.
[41:16.110 --> 41:17.050]  Wait, what?
[41:21.430 --> 41:23.850]  The boys are back in town.
[41:23.850 --> 41:24.820]  Well, well, well.
[41:25.430 --> 41:26.130]  It's Team Tape.
[41:26.430 --> 41:27.630]  What are you doing?
[41:28.350 --> 41:29.830]  That sounds about right for Team Tape.
[41:30.730 --> 41:31.690]  No, it's alright. We're still good.
[41:31.910 --> 41:33.590]  Drive you nuns.
[41:34.730 --> 41:35.730]  You call me a nun?
[41:36.690 --> 41:37.730]  It did sound like it.
[41:37.750 --> 41:40.770]  I'm trying to speak in a language you understand.
[41:40.910 --> 41:42.930]  He questioned it, so I wouldn't do it again.
[41:43.390 --> 41:44.410]  You called me a pedophile.
[41:53.630 --> 41:55.550]  Now, to my credit,
[41:55.690 --> 41:56.830]  I didn't know what that word meant.
[41:57.050 --> 41:57.490]  Yeah.
[41:58.290 --> 41:59.350]  Yeah, to your credit.
[41:59.710 --> 42:01.050]  I thought it was like numpty.
[42:01.690 --> 42:01.970]  No.
[42:06.490 --> 42:08.610]  You said nuns instead of nonce,
[42:08.650 --> 42:09.330]  so I guess maybe...
[42:10.150 --> 42:10.590]  Shit!
[42:11.450 --> 42:12.390]  Oh my god.
[42:12.550 --> 42:13.410]  Oh, Gavin.
[42:13.730 --> 42:14.870]  Oh, all of our money.
[42:15.030 --> 42:15.830]  Oh, I'm dead.
[42:19.330 --> 42:19.690]  Gavin.
[42:21.270 --> 42:21.990]  Oh, Gavin.
[42:23.510 --> 42:24.230]  Oh, Gavin.
[42:24.950 --> 42:27.150]  I got back up to shoot the cops
[42:27.150 --> 42:27.810]  that were shooting you.
[42:28.070 --> 42:29.830]  I didn't have a gun out, so I punched the air
[42:29.830 --> 42:32.370]  as a bunch of my money flew up in the air.
[42:33.930 --> 42:35.210]  We're going to lose so much money.
[42:35.210 --> 42:35.590]  I like this, Gavin.
[42:35.690 --> 42:37.010]  I'm going to keep riding with you.
[42:37.010 --> 42:38.850]  Why? This doesn't work at all.
[42:39.150 --> 42:39.770]  Oh, Nick.
[42:40.130 --> 42:43.250]  Nick, that wasn't because of the plan.
[42:43.350 --> 42:44.710]  That was because of Gavin's driving.
[42:45.170 --> 42:46.390]  Why don't we go two and two?
[42:47.250 --> 42:49.190]  I mean, to me, it works
[42:49.190 --> 42:50.910]  because the person on the back has a better
[42:50.910 --> 42:52.050]  chance at shooting.
[42:53.090 --> 42:54.450]  But what do you guys do?
[42:54.690 --> 42:57.330]  You guys are expressing this, it failed once.
[42:57.510 --> 42:58.870]  You're 0 for 1, and you're like,
[42:58.950 --> 42:59.750]  no, this is the way.
[43:00.550 --> 43:02.710]  You have died on these heists
[43:02.710 --> 43:04.990]  more than me. I'm saying that our
[43:04.990 --> 43:06.990]  plan wasn't the reason that that failed.
[43:07.190 --> 43:08.910]  It was Gavin driving like a
[43:09.510 --> 43:09.890]  nonce.
[43:13.850 --> 43:15.110]  Imagine a road rage
[43:15.110 --> 43:16.810]  instead of being like, man, that guy's driving
[43:16.810 --> 43:17.770]  like a real pedo.
[43:23.930 --> 43:25.210]  See, this is what I'm saying.
[43:26.030 --> 43:26.770]  What's happening?
[43:26.930 --> 43:28.810]  That has nothing to do with me.
[43:29.050 --> 43:30.910]  That has nothing to do with me. I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying
[43:30.910 --> 43:32.990]  the plan...
[43:32.990 --> 43:34.170]  The plan doesn't change the plan.
[43:34.250 --> 43:36.890]  The plan doesn't change the plan.
[43:37.150 --> 43:38.530]  The plan doesn't change the plan.
[43:38.770 --> 43:40.810]  But now Eric can shoot full time.
[43:40.930 --> 43:41.410]  Exactly.
[43:42.090 --> 43:42.530]  Cool.
[43:44.750 --> 43:46.990]  I'm gonna be a stay
[43:46.990 --> 43:48.170]  at home motorcyclist.
[43:49.290 --> 43:50.990]  That remains to be seen.
[43:53.330 --> 43:54.510]  I'm gonna try to get this helicopter.
[43:55.090 --> 43:56.090]  Someone got a bit of air there.
[43:56.430 --> 43:56.810]  Help me.
[43:59.270 --> 44:00.810]  You almost blew Andrew's head off.
[44:00.810 --> 44:02.290]  Nah, I'm not gonna get him.
[44:02.330 --> 44:03.470]  Oh shit, Nick, are you down?
[44:03.670 --> 44:04.710]  Yeah, I'm alright though.
[44:07.970 --> 44:09.530]  I went so high.
[44:10.090 --> 44:11.550]  This is working well.
[44:14.410 --> 44:16.770]  Oh god, they're everywhere.
[44:17.890 --> 44:18.930]  You got clunked up in my wheels a little bit.
[44:18.930 --> 44:19.710]  This one's gonna be on me.
[44:22.490 --> 44:22.890]  Okay.
[44:26.930 --> 44:29.150]  Nick, what happened?
[44:29.490 --> 44:29.890]  I died.
[44:30.250 --> 44:31.210]  I said this was gonna be on me.
[44:33.470 --> 44:34.670]  I thought we had a good plan, Gavin.
[44:35.330 --> 44:36.990]  I think they should hop on their bike
[44:36.990 --> 44:37.450]  as well.
[44:38.850 --> 44:40.770]  I have died one time
[44:40.770 --> 44:41.370]  on this.
[44:41.970 --> 44:43.870]  What do you have against Team Noah?
[44:44.110 --> 44:45.610]  Bad ideas driving on one bike.
[44:46.170 --> 44:47.070]  Let's just try it, Andrew.
[44:48.090 --> 44:49.010]  You drive, I fire.
[44:49.810 --> 44:51.810]  Andrew thinks it's bad ideas now.
[44:51.950 --> 44:55.190]  Come on, Andrew. I'll ride with you.
[44:56.070 --> 44:56.850]  You're in charge.
[44:57.010 --> 44:57.870]  I'll just cover us.
[44:58.030 --> 44:59.610]  Do you think we're under a million yet?
[45:00.250 --> 45:00.590]  Close!
[45:03.310 --> 45:04.030]  Alright, Andrew.
[45:05.010 --> 45:05.890]  Let's do this.
[45:07.910 --> 45:09.170]  We're gonna beat them there, Nick.
[45:11.990 --> 45:12.870]  1.25
[45:16.150 --> 45:17.650]  Alright, let's go.
[45:18.570 --> 45:19.350]  Already behind us.
[45:22.750 --> 45:24.710]  I'm using the mini-SMG, Nick.
[45:24.850 --> 45:26.630]  Any thought on gun?
[45:27.710 --> 45:31.150]  Let me see which one we have.
[45:32.430 --> 45:33.910]  Yeah, I think the SMG's fine.
[45:37.270 --> 45:37.910]  Alright.
[45:42.820 --> 45:43.500]  Go!
[45:47.910 --> 45:49.850]  One helicopter, come on.
[45:49.910 --> 45:50.250]  Nice.
[45:52.910 --> 45:54.190]  Great dodge.
[45:56.070 --> 45:57.590]  Gavin complimenting himself?
[45:58.150 --> 45:59.350]  No, I was complimenting Andrew.
[46:03.900 --> 46:05.160]  Alright, health's already gone.
[46:06.900 --> 46:09.140]  Why would I compliment myself?
[46:11.120 --> 46:12.940]  Sometimes you need a little pick-me-up, you know?
[46:13.740 --> 46:16.160]  I'm not good for...
[46:16.160 --> 46:16.820]  motivation.
[46:21.100 --> 46:22.040]  Why does it keep
[46:22.040 --> 46:23.900]  trying to stop me from shooting sometimes?
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.840]  Might be a funny angle where you're in between
[46:27.840 --> 46:28.340]  turning.
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.280]  Oh, where are you guys going?
[46:32.480 --> 46:33.660]  Holy shit, you confused us.
[46:33.680 --> 46:34.500]  What are you doing?
[46:35.860 --> 46:37.280]  I was trying to stick to the road.
[46:38.820 --> 46:39.840]  They went a weird way.
[46:41.080 --> 46:42.100]  You went a pretty good way,
[46:42.180 --> 46:42.520]  I'd say.
[46:45.240 --> 46:45.980]  Oh, it's two
[46:46.560 --> 46:48.100]  on top of us, I can't shoot it?
[46:50.940 --> 46:52.040]  Should we get back on the road,
[46:52.140 --> 46:54.000]  Eric, or go off-road? I don't know what
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.580]  you're doing. I'm looking at helicopters.
[46:56.080 --> 46:56.800]  What would you prefer?
[46:57.880 --> 47:00.040]  I want a steady shot so I can shoot
[47:00.040 --> 47:00.680]  these helicopters.
[47:02.040 --> 47:08.120]  Oh, god, they're so directly
[47:08.120 --> 47:09.080]  on top of us.
[47:09.260 --> 47:10.880]  Great job.
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.140]  Oh, boy.
[47:19.500 --> 47:19.900]  Tractor!
[47:22.540 --> 47:23.300]  Oh, shit.
[47:24.180 --> 47:25.720]  They're trying real hard.
[47:26.500 --> 47:27.740]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[47:28.180 --> 47:28.960]  Nice dodge.
[47:33.780 --> 47:34.660]  Oh, yes.
[47:35.860 --> 47:37.000]  There we go.
[47:38.500 --> 47:39.240]  Did that work?
[47:39.460 --> 47:40.800]  Should I do it? Holy shit.
[47:41.680 --> 47:43.660]  Gavin, no, not this far!
[47:43.860 --> 47:45.420]  Guns out, guns out, guns out!
[47:48.600 --> 47:49.660]  Get back on, Eric!
[47:49.800 --> 47:50.620]  Get back on, son!
[47:51.020 --> 47:51.480]  That's it!
[47:54.940 --> 47:55.860]  Oh, man!
[47:56.880 --> 47:58.460]  Oh, we're so close!
[48:00.740 --> 48:02.420]  Eric got back on the bike
[48:02.420 --> 48:03.740]  for less than a second.
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.580]  His head just went...
[48:11.100 --> 48:12.320]  Should I do it?
[48:12.600 --> 48:14.640]  Guns out, guns out, guns out!
[48:14.640 --> 48:16.800]  I didn't even get to it. I got hit by a random piece
[48:16.800 --> 48:18.600]  of, like, fence or something.
[48:19.700 --> 48:20.980]  He got hit
[48:20.980 --> 48:22.320]  by a random piece...
[48:22.320 --> 48:24.620]  What happened is the fence really started moving
[48:24.620 --> 48:25.300]  around, guys.
[48:26.220 --> 48:28.640]  Was the fence just stationary, or was it hit
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.540]  by a car into it?
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.760]  You were going towards
[48:32.760 --> 48:34.580]  the SUV. The SUV started going left
[48:34.580 --> 48:36.280]  and right, and the fence was in front of us.
[48:36.440 --> 48:38.760]  I mean, it looked like that fence came out
[48:38.760 --> 48:39.020]  of nowhere.
[48:40.760 --> 48:41.480]  1.119.
[48:46.420 --> 48:47.260]  Try, uh...
[48:47.260 --> 48:48.620]  If you have the compact rifle, Eric,
[48:48.680 --> 48:49.540]  try the compact rifle.
[48:49.620 --> 48:51.000]  I don't think I do.
[48:52.160 --> 48:53.320]  I gotta get that next time.
[48:53.560 --> 48:56.200]  I have the sweeper shotgun!
[48:56.580 --> 48:58.580]  What the fuck? Like, that's gonna work here?
[48:58.660 --> 48:59.160]  That's crazy.
[48:59.960 --> 49:01.260]  A close and personal.
[49:04.420 --> 49:05.320]  Oh, gee, Gavin!
[49:06.580 --> 49:07.000]  Sorry.
[49:09.060 --> 49:09.880]  Unnecessarily close.
[49:14.270 --> 49:14.630]  Alright.
[49:16.230 --> 49:16.590]  Oh!
[49:17.690 --> 49:18.650]  What happened to you guys?
[49:18.890 --> 49:19.810]  Oh, God. We're fine.
[49:19.910 --> 49:21.130]  Keep going, keep going. You're good.
[49:21.610 --> 49:22.050]  You're doing great.
[49:22.470 --> 49:24.450]  I don't see you guys.
[49:25.270 --> 49:26.070]  We're right behind you.
[49:27.810 --> 49:28.650]  We can see you.
[49:31.870 --> 49:33.250]  No, no, right side, right side, right side!
[49:33.350 --> 49:33.750]  There you go.
[49:37.410 --> 49:37.770]  Oh!
[49:38.630 --> 49:39.370]  You like that?
[49:39.370 --> 49:40.090]  Yeah.
[49:43.190 --> 49:45.830]  That SUV does not know what it wants to do.
[49:46.210 --> 49:47.170]  It's just doing circles.
[49:47.970 --> 49:48.950]  So is there really one boost?
[49:49.010 --> 49:49.130]  Oh!
[49:50.250 --> 49:53.090]  You just have to wait for it to charge again, but I don't know where the charge is.
[49:53.330 --> 49:53.950]  Oh, God!
[49:55.250 --> 49:56.050]  Oh, shit!
[49:56.970 --> 49:59.510]  I mean, you can try to shortcut it if you want to, Gavin, but I don't know.
[49:59.890 --> 50:00.070]  Okay.
[50:04.650 --> 50:05.050]  Boost!
[50:05.690 --> 50:07.270]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[50:08.130 --> 50:09.410]  That worked pretty well.
[50:09.890 --> 50:10.890]  That worked pretty well.
[50:11.410 --> 50:12.950]  Now, this maybe wasn't good.
[50:13.230 --> 50:15.550]  Yeah, no, that was a bad idea. You killed me.
[50:15.830 --> 50:16.630]  Ha ha ha!
[50:16.650 --> 50:18.150]  I kept going somehow.
[50:19.510 --> 50:20.690]  You just died.
[50:22.110 --> 50:22.830]  The money!
[50:23.370 --> 50:23.790]  The money!
[50:24.490 --> 50:28.410]  It said that you flattened me, so it must have bounced me out and run me over.
[50:28.630 --> 50:29.650]  Why did you keep going straight?
[50:29.690 --> 50:30.930]  Why didn't you just get back on the road there?
[50:31.230 --> 50:32.250]  You said it was working well.
[50:32.870 --> 50:35.350]  Yeah, the first part, so you cut off the big corner.
[50:35.910 --> 50:37.590]  There was an even bigger corner to cut.
[50:37.590 --> 50:39.790]  I just didn't realize your spine compressed so much
[50:39.790 --> 50:40.890]  you died on impact.
[50:41.210 --> 50:41.930]  Ha ha ha!
[50:42.870 --> 50:46.850]  I've never had someone just drop dead and me continue completely unharmed.
[50:47.330 --> 50:47.590]  Me neither.
[50:47.710 --> 50:48.290]  That was crazy.
[50:51.950 --> 50:53.610]  Alright, one million.
[50:54.330 --> 50:54.830]  Maybe.
[50:54.830 --> 50:58.010]  We should be able to pick up all of the money we dropped on the alternate timeline.
[50:58.310 --> 50:58.910]  Ha ha ha!
[50:59.770 --> 51:00.570]  One million.
[51:00.570 --> 51:01.830]  So close to a million.
[51:05.590 --> 51:06.810]  Grab this armor.
[51:07.230 --> 51:08.850]  Okay, let's do it.
[51:11.310 --> 51:12.970]  Oh, I have a compact grenade launcher.
[51:13.830 --> 51:14.810]  I'm glad we stole that from him.
[51:15.450 --> 51:16.190]  Yeah, I'm not going to do that.
[51:17.410 --> 51:18.270]  I'll stick with the compact.
[51:19.590 --> 51:20.610]  We got this.
[51:23.610 --> 51:24.370]  Easy peasy.
[51:24.770 --> 51:25.730]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[51:27.090 --> 51:27.690]  Got him.
[51:27.690 --> 51:28.870]  That should slow him down.
[51:28.970 --> 51:29.430]  Fuck yeah.
[51:32.390 --> 51:33.250]  You're doing great.
[51:33.290 --> 51:33.870]  You're doing great, Gavin.
[51:34.950 --> 51:36.470]  Ha ha ha!
[51:36.950 --> 51:38.070]  Ha ha ha!
[51:39.650 --> 51:40.870]  Oh shit, Andrew!
[51:41.230 --> 51:41.670]  Squirrely.
[51:42.450 --> 51:42.930]  Squirrely!
[51:44.970 --> 51:46.790]  Tree! There was a tree.
[51:46.910 --> 51:47.970]  The bikes are stuck.
[51:48.290 --> 51:49.650]  Get this down.
[51:50.410 --> 51:51.850]  I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[51:52.970 --> 51:54.450]  Did it freeze you?
[51:55.230 --> 51:56.590]  Oh my god.
[52:02.230 --> 52:03.270]  998,000.
[52:03.270 --> 52:03.970]  I'm predicting.
[52:04.410 --> 52:05.690]  Let's be closer to each other.
[52:08.250 --> 52:09.990]  Why does that matter?
[52:10.510 --> 52:11.030]  Because...
[52:11.030 --> 52:13.290]  You're fucking dying every time.
[52:13.450 --> 52:16.950]  Because you're dodging stuff
[52:16.950 --> 52:18.870]  and by the time we get there, the hole's really small.
[52:19.050 --> 52:20.550]  But if we go through together, the hole's still big.
[52:20.550 --> 52:22.330]  I was in the fucking hills.
[52:22.950 --> 52:25.010]  I was off to the side.
[52:25.010 --> 52:26.810]  He made his own hole.
[52:27.730 --> 52:29.270]  Just stop hitting shit.
[52:30.410 --> 52:32.310]  Just stop hitting shit, Gavin.
[52:33.390 --> 52:36.430]  Well, we got sort of forced off the road
[52:36.430 --> 52:37.950]  by a cop car into a tree.
[52:38.290 --> 52:39.950]  Just stop hitting shit though.
[52:40.950 --> 52:42.710]  Gavin, you want to switch it up?
[52:43.050 --> 52:43.690]  Yeah, yeah, you drive.
[52:45.350 --> 52:45.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[52:46.290 --> 52:47.010]  Take the pressure off.
[52:49.170 --> 52:50.250]  It's still at a million!
[52:50.250 --> 52:50.750]  Yay!
[52:51.630 --> 52:53.830]  If you do it first time, I'll be kind of bubbed out.
[52:55.470 --> 52:56.410]  It'll say something.
[52:56.730 --> 52:57.430]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[52:58.570 --> 52:59.450]  Sword off shotgun?
[53:00.690 --> 53:01.470]  That's what I...
[53:01.470 --> 53:02.650]  It's got to be something
[53:04.690 --> 53:06.310]  a little more spraying.
[53:07.390 --> 53:07.890]  I think.
[53:08.110 --> 53:09.650]  But you do what you feel.
[53:10.850 --> 53:12.230]  Oh, that chopper's already on us.
[53:13.630 --> 53:14.470]  Okay, here we go.
[53:15.170 --> 53:15.570]  Got him.
[53:15.990 --> 53:16.550]  Guys, way up!
[53:16.550 --> 53:17.470]  Good shot.
[53:17.510 --> 53:18.630]  Don't wait up.
[53:19.490 --> 53:20.050]  Okay.
[53:25.650 --> 53:26.690]  Helicopter on us behind.
[53:27.650 --> 53:29.350]  I don't know if there's much you can do about it, but
[53:29.350 --> 53:31.110]  you know, it is what it is.
[53:32.670 --> 53:33.230]  Yeah.
[53:34.590 --> 53:35.550]  Nice boost.
[53:35.810 --> 53:36.710]  Thank you.
[53:38.690 --> 53:40.390]  It's just great shooting it.
[53:41.570 --> 53:42.330]  Thank you.
[53:42.590 --> 53:43.410]  Helping everybody.
[53:44.250 --> 53:44.990]  Nice and easy.
[53:46.830 --> 53:47.310]  Nice.
[53:47.310 --> 53:49.330]  Don't shoot the non-cop cars
[53:49.330 --> 53:50.530]  because they leave in front of us.
[53:50.910 --> 53:51.530]  Not you.
[53:54.290 --> 53:55.250]  Not you.
[53:56.330 --> 53:56.990]  We still got this.
[53:57.490 --> 53:57.830]  Don't say anything.
[53:59.570 --> 54:00.050]  Alright.
[54:01.630 --> 54:03.010]  Good force off me.
[54:03.250 --> 54:03.670]  Thank you!
[54:04.030 --> 54:06.070]  That was awesome.
[54:08.510 --> 54:09.690]  Bring up your
[54:09.690 --> 54:11.170]  menu so you can get health
[54:11.170 --> 54:12.970]  and armor and everything.
[54:14.990 --> 54:16.070]  Come on, come on, come on.
[54:17.530 --> 54:19.670]  That wasn't even a cop car.
[54:20.030 --> 54:21.250]  No, no, no.
[54:21.250 --> 54:22.870]  No, no, no, no.
[54:23.230 --> 54:24.830]  Oh, I keep using armor instead of sprinting.
[54:25.410 --> 54:25.510]  Ow.
[54:26.310 --> 54:30.710]  I want to do that one more time.
[54:31.350 --> 54:33.230]  I got shot in the top of my balaclava
[54:33.230 --> 54:34.110]  and there was blood on it.
[54:38.490 --> 54:40.770]  That was a really scenic death shot
[54:40.770 --> 54:42.730]  on ours. We were in a field.
[54:43.690 --> 54:44.370]  Real pretty.
[54:44.750 --> 54:45.910]  You still want to drive, Eric?
[54:46.350 --> 54:47.530]  Yeah, I want to do that one more time.
[54:47.790 --> 54:49.570]  Going from shooting to driving was tough
[54:49.570 --> 54:51.150]  and then I think I'm locked in now.
[54:51.530 --> 54:52.530]  Hell yeah, son.
[54:53.030 --> 54:54.930]  We totally got away with that first one.
[54:55.390 --> 54:57.490]  I think it's dropping us 10,000 per now.
[54:57.810 --> 55:00.530]  I just need you to not shoot cars that aren't cop cars.
[55:01.250 --> 55:01.410]  Yeah.
[55:03.030 --> 55:08.710]  Yeah, it's taking it easy on us with the money.
[55:09.010 --> 55:09.230]  Yeah.
[55:09.230 --> 55:11.850]  I think it's 600 grand that it slowed down.
[55:12.470 --> 55:13.210]  Get on!
[55:13.410 --> 55:14.730]  See if there's anything in here.
[55:14.910 --> 55:16.850]  Nope, just armor. Okay, here we go.
[55:17.090 --> 55:17.690]  Here we go!
[55:19.010 --> 55:19.810]  Okay, you ready?
[55:21.030 --> 55:22.330]  Hell yeah, let's do this shit.
[55:25.290 --> 55:27.390]  The boost seems to make very little
[55:27.390 --> 55:28.350]  difference to the speed.
[55:31.390 --> 55:32.450]  Minimal at best.
[55:32.870 --> 55:35.510]  I wonder if it just makes it easier
[55:35.510 --> 55:36.930]  for you to react in that moment.
[55:36.930 --> 55:37.450]  I don't know.
[55:38.370 --> 55:39.650]  Like bullet time?
[55:39.970 --> 55:40.250]  Yeah, almost.
[55:41.030 --> 55:45.070]  I feel like it's taking it
[55:45.070 --> 55:46.510]  especially easy on us.
[55:47.370 --> 55:49.150]  Yeah, they're not even coming for us.
[55:51.350 --> 55:52.310]  No helicopter.
[55:52.590 --> 55:53.230]  Oh, here we go.
[55:54.530 --> 55:54.850]  Whoa!
[55:58.170 --> 55:59.530]  How about that, Gavin?
[55:59.710 --> 56:01.230]  That was fantastic.
[56:01.510 --> 56:02.350]  Where did the bike go?
[56:02.350 --> 56:03.550]  It's right here! It's by me!
[56:03.590 --> 56:06.430]  Okay, we're in front.
[56:06.690 --> 56:07.210]  Go ahead.
[56:08.250 --> 56:08.970]  Let's go.
[56:10.630 --> 56:11.130]  Nice job.
[56:11.910 --> 56:12.590]  That was great.
[56:14.210 --> 56:15.050]  Good. Nice shot.
[56:20.630 --> 56:22.370]  Killed them before they got across us.
[56:24.250 --> 56:26.110]  That was a nifty tree.
[56:26.590 --> 56:28.270]  Yes, the classic nifty tree.
[56:30.170 --> 56:31.390]  Native to the area.
[56:31.390 --> 56:32.110]  Yeah.
[56:33.150 --> 56:34.430]  California native plant.
[56:43.140 --> 56:44.620]  Very nice. Very strong.
[56:44.940 --> 56:45.820]  Thank you.
[56:46.520 --> 56:49.040]  Come on! How did that kill us?
[56:49.680 --> 56:50.620]  It didn't kill us, did it?
[56:50.700 --> 56:51.380]  Oh, you died?
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.760]  You've got such a weak spine.
[56:55.220 --> 56:56.280]  I don't know how I died.
[56:56.520 --> 56:57.700]  It was just a jump.
[56:57.960 --> 56:59.600]  It's just a jump on the motorcycle.
[57:00.600 --> 57:02.220]  Have you got realism turned on?
[57:04.160 --> 57:05.220]  That is crazy!
[57:06.100 --> 57:07.340]  Why is it killing me?
[57:08.200 --> 57:08.400]  What?
[57:08.900 --> 57:09.940]  Someone voted to quit.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.200]  It was probably Nick.
[57:12.880 --> 57:14.980]  No! God, no! I didn't vote to quit.
[57:14.980 --> 57:15.980]  I hit the right trigger.
[57:16.560 --> 57:17.620]  Nick doesn't want to play this anymore.
[57:18.220 --> 57:20.100]  What are you talking about? I want to win.
[57:22.220 --> 57:23.660]  The minigun is invisible again.
[57:25.040 --> 57:25.720]  That was...
[57:25.720 --> 57:27.140]  I can't believe...
[57:27.140 --> 57:29.980]  When you guys see that in the edit,
[57:30.120 --> 57:30.940]  you'll watch it and go,
[57:30.940 --> 57:32.140]  How did that kill you?
[57:32.360 --> 57:32.760]  I don't know.
[57:33.140 --> 57:35.020]  I lived again. I wasn't even hurt.
[57:38.080 --> 57:38.800]  Ah, shit!
[57:39.160 --> 57:39.580]  Live together.
[57:40.220 --> 57:40.760]  Die alone.
[57:41.980 --> 57:42.320]  Damn it.
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.340]  Getting really good at that part.
[57:47.500 --> 57:47.880]  Hell yeah!
[57:47.880 --> 57:49.880]  Hell yeah!
[57:59.020 --> 58:01.240]  It's going so easy.
[58:01.500 --> 58:04.200]  It is going so easy on us.
[58:05.180 --> 58:05.720]  For now.
[58:05.940 --> 58:06.680]  Yeah, it is.
[58:07.520 --> 58:08.280]  That's because it was like,
[58:08.320 --> 58:10.220]  He broke his own back.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.780]  The 10 grand that we're losing each time
[58:14.780 --> 58:15.860]  just buys off one cop.
[58:18.820 --> 58:20.400]  I cannot believe it killed us.
[58:20.480 --> 58:21.820]  I don't want to go off-road now.
[58:21.860 --> 58:22.980]  I just want to stick to the road.
[58:23.460 --> 58:26.000]  With your paper spine, I think we should stay on the road.
[58:26.760 --> 58:27.160]  Crazy.
[58:27.480 --> 58:28.160]  Oh, chopper!
[58:34.060 --> 58:35.600]  Oh, God in heaven!
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.220]  Holy shit!
[58:37.220 --> 58:38.660]  That was some network latency.
[58:39.060 --> 58:40.040]  That was crazy.
[58:40.500 --> 58:41.180]  Did you get net coded?
[58:42.040 --> 58:43.700]  We did, but it didn't impact us.
[58:44.560 --> 58:46.140]  I shot down a chopper!
[58:46.820 --> 58:47.420]  Nice, Nick.
[58:47.420 --> 58:48.120]  Nice, good work.
[58:51.720 --> 58:52.820]  Go to hell!
[58:54.620 --> 58:56.060]  These bikes are so slow.
[58:56.660 --> 58:57.460]  I don't...
[58:57.460 --> 58:59.520]  Like, why all of a sudden
[58:59.520 --> 59:01.320]  is it so slow? God, I want to go off of that.
[59:09.220 --> 59:10.880]  I've been waiting for us to clip that.
[59:12.880 --> 59:13.540]  What the?
[59:14.500 --> 59:15.120]  Are they down?
[59:15.120 --> 59:15.920]  We're alright.
[59:16.500 --> 59:16.880]  Maybe.
[59:17.840 --> 59:19.780]  Get on the bike!
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.380]  Oh, that's it.
[59:24.220 --> 59:25.760]  It's just the family going on holiday.
[59:37.420 --> 59:38.780]  We've got to helicopter back.
[59:43.250 --> 59:45.010]  What the fuck?
[59:45.990 --> 59:47.810]  What happened?
[59:47.810 --> 59:48.190]  What happened?
[59:49.950 --> 59:51.090]  Let me on. Let me on. Let me on.
[59:51.130 --> 59:52.090]  Get on! Get on! Get on!
[59:54.130 --> 59:55.690]  That looked like it warped
[59:55.690 --> 59:56.210]  in front of us.
[59:57.310 --> 59:58.830]  Ow, the bloody armor.
[59:58.910 --> 59:59.210]  Whoa!
[01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.310]  That's for you!
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.440]  Whoa!
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.140]  Right in front of us.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.460]  Just don't shoot cars that aren't cops
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.220]  because they're going to dip in front of us.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.380]  I see them in the distance going over the hill.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.520]  Yeah, me too.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.860]  We hit the smallest little bump.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.120]  Okay, Nick, hop on. Hop on.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.880]  I got you covered. Hold on.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.980]  Where are you?
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.680]  Oh, God, the water!
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.600]  Eat snacks.
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.260]  I'm all gas. No brakes.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.820]  We're getting all the way.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.780]  Head to the canyon.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.300]  Oh! Oh!
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.560]  Oh!
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.260]  It's okay. We're okay. We're okay.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.780]  I'm boosting.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.380]  Yes!
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:00:59.700]  Chopper!
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.000]  Fuck!
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.020]  What happened there?
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.280]  Hit one of the posts.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.000]  I'm down. I'm down.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:12.680]  No!
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:15.220]  No!
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.160]  Do you not have your
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.480]  snacks menu open, Eric?
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.280]  When I hit the thing,
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.320]  it took most of my health away.
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.000]  But you could just go...
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.520]  When I hit that...
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.620]  Okay, I'll keep it open.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.180]  Most of the time, I use A to
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:34.740]  brake.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.060]  I'll try to use left trigger.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.820]  You can use... Yeah.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.400]  It's just...
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.480]  No, it's just a softer brake.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.040]  I like the firmer brake.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.440]  You like it firm? It's fine.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.820]  We'll beat it on this one.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.560]  Man, we... That was
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.600]  such a fun run. That was crazy.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.920]  It was really good. It's the furthest we got.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.320]  Together.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.240]  Well, even just in general.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.440]  We haven't gotten that far.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.320]  Oh, everybody's
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:03.740]  sliding.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.740]  What? No! Hold on. Hold on. Sorry.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.800]  Alright, here we go. I was like, don't leave me.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.740]  Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.940]  How are you guys doing up there?
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.740]  Okay, I have my
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.220]  snacks and armor menu up.
[01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:43.490]  Don't... I thought we talked about this.
[01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:44.610]  She just died.
[01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.730]  Oh, look at all these.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.150]  That's a shitload.
[01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:50.250]  Shitload of shitters.
[01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.390]  That's a shitload of shitters, alright.
[01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.170]  Jesus Christ, what a...
[01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:58.190]  Okay. Nice!
[01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.610]  Doing my best.
[01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:04.010]  Oh my god, that guy!
[01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:06.670]  That's just a civilian.
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.430]  That dude is like,
[01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:10.030]  I want no part of that.
[01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:11.250]  Try left side.
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:12.770]  Right side.
[01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.310]  Oh my god! What the...
[01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.770]  Holy fuck.
[01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:22.910]  Netcode!
[01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.910]  Woo!
[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.650]  God, that chopper wants all of us.
[01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:39.050]  Okay.
[01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:42.270]  Keep it smooth. Keep it good. Keep it nice.
[01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:44.250]  Make it even.
[01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:49.210]  Alright.
[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:50.810]  Oh, where is that chopper?
[01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:51.470]  There it is.
[01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:54.350]  Alright, here we come around this bend here
[01:03:54.350 --> 01:03:55.350]  in just a second.
[01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:58.770]  Yes.
[01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:02.190]  Big pileup up ahead.
[01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:02.870]  Just so you guys know.
[01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:06.370]  Huge pileup coming up
[01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:07.350]  on you. Okay.
[01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.930]  Gavin, make sure your armor and snacks are good.
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:10.470]  Yeah.
[01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.130]  Oh, Nick!
[01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:14.810]  Oh!
[01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.670]  That's a little scary, man.
[01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:19.390]  I got...
[01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.070]  That was real scary.
[01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:23.850]  I'm gonna change my weapons.
[01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:27.670]  That's the gun for explosives.
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:36.330]  That was insane!
[01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.330]  I'm gonna pass out!
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:38.350]  I'm gonna faint!
[01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.730]  Did you see that?!
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:45.750]  Did you see that?!
[01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.190]  We landed on the sign!
[01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.730]  I landed on the billboard!
[01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:52.490]  God, I don't want to be this close to them.
[01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:57.690]  That is so cool.
[01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:01.230]  Andrew, you still conscious?
[01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:02.450]  I'm good.
[01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.990]  He's driving pretty well for it if he's not.
[01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:11.370]  Oh!
[01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:13.150]  Oh!
[01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.850]  Split the difference.
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.270]  Oh, that's an innocent person.
[01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.610]  Why is that minivan getting lit up?
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.520]  Oh, it's looking nice.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.360]  Shut up.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.240]  Oh my god, shut up.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.240]  Okay.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.580]  Pull over!
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.400]  Shut up. Go to hell.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:38.760]  Okay.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:40.980]  Ah, he's right on our ass.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:41.900]  Yeah, I know.
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:44.760]  Come on now.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.440]  Yeah, yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.980]  Just watch your armor and everything. You should be good.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.660]  Oh, shit.
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.060]  Some cover.
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:57.880]  What do we do?
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:58.680]  Is it a park?
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.820]  No, just keep going.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.620]  Keep going?
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.120]  Just go through the tunnel.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.300]  Oh.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.840]  Oh, god.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.340]  Ouchies.
[01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:15.930]  Okay.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.460]  Chiliad.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.540]  Sheriff!
[01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.050]  To the bridge.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:33.800]  Oh.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.200]  Some treacherous roads.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.100]  Yep.
[01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.130]  I'm going, Gavin. I'm not going to be the one.
[01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:45.650]  I'm going nice and easy.
[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.590]  Just careful silence.
[01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.610]  Looks like we have a cop coming up.
[01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.070]  He's just chilling on the road.
[01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.290]  Oh my god, we're going to drive off and use the parachute?
[01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.930]  Are we?
[01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.130]  Is that what he said?
[01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:04.210]  That's what he said.
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.010]  Oh, shit.
[01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:08.030]  Alright.
[01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:10.290]  Oh.
[01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:11.170]  Oh.
[01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:16.030]  Oh my god.
[01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:16.990]  Gavin.
[01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:20.530]  Full speed!
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.350]  Parachute! Parachute! Parachute!
[01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:26.210]  What's the...
[01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.130]  Y and then A.
[01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:30.430]  Oh my god.
[01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:31.010]  Are you serious?
[01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:33.350]  Are you shitting me?
[01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.890]  I had...
[01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:38.450]  the...
[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:41.050]  fucking...
[01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:41.590]  Okay.
[01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:44.870]  So instead of pulling your chute, you were stuffing
[01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:46.870]  snacks down your throat as you plummeted
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.510]  towards the earth.
[01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:50.730]  He's just eating PB&Js
[01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:52.470]  as he's plummeting towards the earth.
[01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.290]  You're just choking on peanut butter
[01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.130]  as you hit the ground
[01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:58.490]  at 170 miles an hour.
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:59.970]  I'm so sorry.
[01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:03.330]  I'm so sorry.
[01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:05.310]  Nick!
[01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:05.470]  Nick!
[01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.450]  Nick!
[01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.870]  Nick!
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.750]  What the fuck?
[01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:21.790]  The game feels bad for us and stop taking money.
[01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:23.390]  Yeah, it stopped a while ago.
[01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:26.610]  I, um...
[01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:28.990]  I'm very...
[01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:30.650]  There's no apology.
[01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.590]  I agree.
[01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:33.250]  Uh-huh.
[01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:34.770]  Wait, say it.
[01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:35.350]  Say it.
[01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.350]  That's what, Nick?
[01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:41.890]  Uh-huh.
[01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.030]  Who's that on?
[01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:45.110]  I don't know. What are you talking about?
[01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:46.670]  That's on the game design, really.
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:49.370]  Yeah, that must be it.
[01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:50.810]  It's on the game design.
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.810]  That's my fault. I'm sorry.
[01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:55.350]  I think it's NoNick2025.
[01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.170]  How do you do the parachute?
[01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:02.550]  He's just eating sandwiches.
[01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:04.570]  Snack it away!
[01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:06.770]  Oh, my God!
[01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.630]  What was that?
[01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:10.610]  That's on me.
[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:12.610]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.750]  Nick is on tilt!
[01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.510]  I just want to die!
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.590]  Stop using the grenade launcher!
[01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:19.770]  You said you'd stop.
[01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:20.990]  I did.
[01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.650]  You said you'd stop.
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.790]  You told me you'd stop using the grenade launcher.
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.590]  He sent a flaming vehicle at us.
[01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:28.850]  He was like,
[01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.270]  I'll stop, and then he blew us up.
[01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:31.670]  You said this was your last time!
[01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:35.190]  It was! It was the last time!
[01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:36.970]  No, that's not what I was talking about.
[01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:42.630]  Oh.
[01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:46.550]  I want to wipe the tears from my eyes, but I can't.
[01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.910]  I can't believe I just ate sandwiches.
[01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:51.650]  It was just a death.
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:55.110]  What's amazing is that if we were doing Criminal Masterminds,
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:57.230]  we wouldn't have died a single time
[01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:58.950]  up to this point in any of the heists.
[01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:00.710]  And that would have been a death.
[01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:02.370]  That would be the downfall.
[01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.870]  I legit forgot that the window was open.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:11.990]  Did you figure it out after you hit the ground?
[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.770]  No, I figured it out like five seconds from the earth.
[01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.830]  Exited out,
[01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:18.010]  pulled the chute, hit the ground.
[01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:21.510]  Damn it.
[01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:25.250]  Eating snacks to death.
[01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.010]  I even used our boost
[01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:31.210]  to try to get us the most air possible.
[01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:34.870]  You gave us plenty of air.
[01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.010]  Watch your armor, watch your health.
[01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.830]  Every car I go by, I lose all of my armor.
[01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.070]  Use the tractor to block them a little.
[01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:58.370]  I can't believe it sent us all the way back to the beginning.
[01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:00.190]  Insane.
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.070]  Oh shit.
[01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:03.550]  Hit the chub.
[01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.930]  Hit the chub, Parrot.
[01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:07.710]  I'm not doing that shit.
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:11.010]  That is not how we got here.
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.050]  We got here by taking it slow and steady, bud.
[01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.770]  Hehehehe.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.960]  Catch him back up.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.520]  Cop coming up.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.300]  Is it even less cops than before?
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.480]  We either got the hang of this,
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.940]  or this is so much easier.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.120]  Yeah, we still have to have Nick use the parachute,
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.220]  so I wouldn't say anything yet.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.700]  That's the X factor.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.940]  Which side? Okay, there we go.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.580]  Cool.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.360]  Don't back up.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.860]  Hey, it's the old ambush bridge.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.060]  Oh no!
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.180]  Oh!
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.140]  I'm pinned!
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.000]  We got...
[01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.400]  We got fucking pinched.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880]  There's nothing you can do right there, man.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.480]  You just got pinched.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:05.160]  That was bad.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.720]  I got my back snapped over the railing.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.200]  Yep.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.100]  Well, I can at least rub the tears out of my eyes.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:15.780]  That was nice.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.420]  So what, you landed on a sign?
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.620]  I landed on the billboard.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.220]  We had to drive off of the billboard.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.880]  We were on the ramp of the billboard.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.500]  We landed it.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.780]  Was your vision tunneling up a little bit?
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.680]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.040]  I laughed so hard, all the air left my body.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.780]  I was so shocked.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:42.860]  Holy shit.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.240]  I'm so sorry, editor.
[01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.220]  No, no, no.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:45.760]  Switch up.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.260]  You're crazy.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.780]  Get on your goddamn...
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.280]  What are you doing?
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.260]  You hit me.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.660]  You hit me with the fucking bike.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.900]  This is not the way to do this.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.360]  What's happening?
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:01.960]  It could be.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.140]  We had to wait for them because we got too far ahead.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.560]  Are you shitting me?
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.320]  That's how bad we were at getting on a bike?
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:09.700]  Yes.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:12.800]  Well...
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:14.600]  Wee.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.000]  Alright, Eric, try and clench your spine real nice.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:19.760]  I'm doing my best.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.260]  Hey, fella.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.320]  Oh, that's a person.
[01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:27.860]  Whoops.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.840]  As long as you're not using the granny launcher,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:32.940]  honestly, I don't mind.
[01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.480]  Oh, god.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:34.800]  Okay.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.160]  You alright?
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.680]  Yeah, we just got a little clip there.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.420]  Little thing.
[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:49.710]  Nice squeeze.
[01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:50.610]  Thank you.
[01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:53.690]  Tough.
[01:13:54.010 --> 01:13:54.910]  That was good. Way to go.
[01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:00.410]  Right in front.
[01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:02.530]  Pick a side. Oh, good work.
[01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:05.870]  My spine is clenched.
[01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.490]  My armor is on. My health is full.
[01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:10.690]  Can't lose.
[01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:13.670]  Oh, shit.
[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.690]  You didn't do it.
[01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:18.050]  I thought for sure that rock would kill us.
[01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:23.470]  You went the crazy... Oh, my god.
[01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:26.210]  I'm in neutral.
[01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:31.670]  See, that was nice.
[01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.390]  That was good.
[01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:34.990]  Crazy.
[01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:39.850]  Oh.
[01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.290]  You went over a hill
[01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:48.590]  and Nick immediately started shooting at a tractor
[01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:50.630]  and then had a moment of shock that it wasn't a cop.
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:51.350]  It wasn't a tractor.
[01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:53.130]  I was shooting at the van.
[01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.210]  Whoa, that guy's hauling ass.
[01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:58.090]  Oh, my god.
[01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.550]  They're going!
[01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:01.590]  I'm dead.
[01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:04.030]  What happened to you?
[01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.870]  That car came up
[01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:07.930]  and hit us
[01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.230]  just hard enough to kill me.
[01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.930]  Nick got run over while on the back
[01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:12.430]  of the bike.
[01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:15.990]  Maybe I was shot.
[01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.470]  I don't know.
[01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:19.290]  What was the thing Nick did before that added
[01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:20.470]  an additional hour?
[01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.770]  Oh, it was the prison.
[01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:25.530]  Is this worse than the prison with the windmills?
[01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:26.470]  No. Yeah.
[01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:29.890]  We didn't do anything
[01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.090]  this time except not pull the chute.
[01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:33.950]  Yeah, I know. That was the problem. You gotta pull the chute.
[01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.950]  That was
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:36.770]  an honest mistake.
[01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:41.410]  Shit happens, you know?
[01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.930]  What?
[01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:53.950]  This is you crashing into the earth
[01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:54.930]  eating sandwiches.
[01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:57.990]  Have half
[01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:59.330]  a million dollars on your back.
[01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:00.710]  Munch it away.
[01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:03.990]  I like that canonically this is right after
[01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:05.910]  we left the bank even though that was like an
[01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:06.450]  hour ago.
[01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:09.550]  That's why there aren't any cops anymore.
[01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:11.790]  It's a long video. Yeah, they gave up.
[01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.790]  Their shift ended.
[01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:23.470]  Oh my god!
[01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:26.310]  Holy shit! On my screen we like
[01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.950]  drove over them.
[01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:30.650]  We got run over real good.
[01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:34.430]  Nick, if you get a chance...
[01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:37.770]  This is not going well.
[01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:39.430]  That was just not a good one.
[01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.470]  I was lacing
[01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:46.370]  it. I felt so good in that driver's seat, man.
[01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:47.150]  Yeah.
[01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.370]  We had some room to
[01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:51.590]  give. That's fine.
[01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:53.350]  Had some room to give.
[01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:55.490]  That was a driving error on my part.
[01:16:55.930 --> 01:16:56.850]  Hey, you know what?
[01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:57.690]  No.
[01:16:57.690 --> 01:16:58.230]  It happens.
[01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:02.010]  Not even an error. They just pulled in front of you.
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:07.730]  Me and Gavin are now doing a race
[01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:09.090]  to the bike to see who gets to drive.
[01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.990]  I like that.
[01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:13.550]  Remember when all of us were driving the bikes?
[01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:17.010]  It feels so long ago. It was.
[01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:19.630]  Well, that was a very
[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:20.210]  clear winner.
[01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:22.630]  What the fuck?
[01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:25.410]  My guy got lost.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.980]  Oh, this is interesting.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.380]  What are we doing?
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.380]  I don't know.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.920]  What do you mean you don't know? You're driving.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.080]  Andrew, did you...
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.840]  What is going on?
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.320]  We tried something. It didn't work.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:52.140]  That was on me.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.100]  Did he die?
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.200]  He died in front of me.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.100]  I had to get out of my system.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.520]  What happened?
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.340]  I just tried to turn left.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.600]  I was like, what if I turn left?
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.080]  What about the marker that way? And we drove into a car.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.640]  Did it seem closer?
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:07.520]  No.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.240]  That was in your system?
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:12.460]  What?
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.220]  I haven't fucked up in a long time.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.400]  I just had to get one out.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.320]  That's fair.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.980]  I get it.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.580]  I don't know that that's true.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.080]  Windows.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:30.420]  Windows.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:30.820]  The Harrier.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.560]  I was trying to pick Gavin up.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.680]  I think we could have done it too, Gavin.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.620]  If the wave hadn't crashed up.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:39.380]  I agree.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.100]  I would have done it again, but I didn't want to...
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.000]  I didn't want to...
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.060]  live through the rest of the...
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.540]  impact of that decision.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:57.920]  Whoa!
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.880]  He said you'd stop using it.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:05.080]  Are you using the compact grenade launcher?
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.520]  I shot down a chopper with it!
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.420]  Nice shot.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:09.860]  Thank you.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.280]  I'm going to change guns now.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.480]  You should do that every time.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:18.440]  Okay.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:18.540]  Okay.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:27.380]  Hey.
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.080]  I think Nick did it again.
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.700]  I think Nick thought that he...
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.680]  hadn't fucked up in a while, so he was like...
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.660]  I got one in me, it's fine.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.620]  Gavin, why did you tell me to do that?
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:39.700]  Why did you...
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:42.040]  I didn't say do it more.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.280]  I just said do it next time.
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.020]  He said, okay.
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.060]  And he shot, and a car...
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:49.740]  exploded, and he had everybody killed.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.040]  It just flew off my bike.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:55.500]  Was that in your system?
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.180]  It's gone now.
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.060]  That was so unnecessary.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.080]  It killed you instantly.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.780]  I thought we were going to start the Tuesday heist today.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.500]  Stop walking into the garbage.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.740]  We will in the next video.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:38.220]  Nick, could you try just not shooting?
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.340]  You want me not to shoot?
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.940]  Yeah, just try it. Let's just see what happens.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:44.780]  Okay.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.060]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:53.780]  Why?
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.840]  He came out of nowhere.
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.680]  Why'd you do that?
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.680]  Because I was focused on their back tire that you were shooting.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:06.020]  And then all of a sudden, that thing just came out.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.200]  Do you think about how
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.480]  if Nick didn't have that window open, we would be done?
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.260]  Yeah.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:18.920]  I do.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.400]  Can we go
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.880]  get me a compact grenade launcher?
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.200]  Because that looks real fun.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.780]  I need to get a bunch of new weapons after this.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.060]  Yeah, once we finish
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.340]  and get our $7 that we split for.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.700]  Once I get my cut of $16,
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.720]  I'm going to be in the shop.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.420]  At least it's not making us
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.260]  re-buy ammo.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:42.500]  You know,
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.740]  the way you've been using it,
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.680]  I kind of wish you did.
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.300]  Don't walk through the garbage.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.280]  Walk around the garbage.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:49.700]  Okay.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:53.960]  Damn it!
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:54.640]  What's it doing?
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.660]  Every time I press Y, I take the long way
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:02.880]  through a bunch of bin bags.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880]  Just walk around to the other side
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.100]  and then hit it.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.600]  Yeah, alright.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.340]  At the end.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.600]  I don't like being this close
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:20.980]  to them.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:22.660]  Why?
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.640]  I'm shooting at choppers, nothing else.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.140]  It doesn't have anything to do with you, you dunce.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.040]  Uh...
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:35.900]  Then why don't you like being close?
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.140]  Because when the
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:40.180]  cops get close to you, they start their
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.220]  evasion, and then we have to
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.220]  go based on where you go.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.020]  I'm getting conflicting reports
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.020]  from Team Tape. One of them wants us right
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.400]  on top of them, the other one doesn't want us anywhere close.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.880]  One of us is driving
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.860]  and the other one's not.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.820]  I've got no opinions, I'm just sat on the back of the bike.
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.860]  Why don't you guys go ahead?
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.700]  No, no, no, you're fine.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.520]  You're good, I just have to
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.600]  dip back a little bit further.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.840]  What I need is Gavin
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.060]  not to walk through the trash.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.780]  I'm gonna try and take a wide berth.
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:12.000]  You running through that pile
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.900]  of trash every time? I'm kicking all the way
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:14.580]  through it, I don't know why.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.900]  Alright, I'm over here, I'm on the other side, I'm pressing Y.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.140]  Yes, exactly.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.960]  You did it like you were proving a point
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.180]  and then you proved my point.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.820]  I swear I did that last time.
[01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:34.570]  Nick? It's just for the
[01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:35.210]  choppers.
[01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:38.350]  Alright, I'm changing weapons.
[01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:40.610]  I want someone with a bigger
[01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:42.470]  clip than... Yeah, me too.
[01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.610]  16 bullets.
[01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:46.210]  Oh, boy.
[01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:48.210]  Oh, Gavin. I saw that.
[01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:54.110]  Oh, Gavin, not Gavin, no.
[01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:55.390]  Oh, Gavin, Gavin.
[01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.990]  That is
[01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.810]  more for me to worry about.
[01:23:58.890 --> 01:24:01.870]  What does that land? I don't know.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.960]  Heavy pistol might be good.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:11.040]  I think it fires too slow.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:12.560]  Yeah.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.480]  That's a flare.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.960]  Gavin's shooting flares.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:21.260]  Oh!
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.840]  I died
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.640]  because we got pinned to a wall.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.580]  Nick didn't do anything specific.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:35.940]  Okay.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.720]  They pinned us and we shot up
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.940]  into the air and it got me.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.480]  When I landed, I died.
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.920]  You died from a fall again?
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:46.740]  I think so.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.660]  We're gonna do more heists later.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.000]  That's what I was saying.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.600]  I was excited to start Doomsday.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.960]  We will. We got it.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.540]  Do the first part of the first...
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.080]  Doomsday? The first part of the first part?
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.120]  Part one, part one.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.040]  Oh, that's such a hint.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.460]  What the fuck?
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:16.580]  Ah!
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.000]  Ah!
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.060]  It had me throw Andrew off the motorcycle.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.240]  You threw me off the bike!
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.460]  You fucking grabbed me by both sides
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.760]  and threw me to the ground.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.640]  I feel like we've become not the problem.
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.620]  That's not necessarily true.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.660]  When I hear that from Andrew,
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.360]  I'll believe it.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.140]  At least we got a good amount of distance.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:51.380]  Fuck.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.280]  God damn it.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.540]  Appreciate it.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.660]  Oh, I see why you got stuck here.
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.460]  That sucked.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.620]  God damn, I died!
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:06.360]  They shot me with a shotgun right there!
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.280]  Nick, you pedophile!
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:09.700]  No!
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.420]  Are we nonsense?
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.580]  What's going on here?
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:19.740]  Are we nonsense?
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.140]  Is that the info?
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.120]  What's going on?
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.060]  I don't like this.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.280]  Next time you go to England, you gotta say that to the passport guy.
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.480]  Hey, what's up?
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:31.660]  Are we nonsense or what?
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.280]  Sir, step over here.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.960]  A little bit nonsense.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:38.940]  Step over here, sir.
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.020]  Remember when we had to do crowd control?
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.300]  Yeah, that was fun.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.720]  That was this video.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.600]  We did another setup in this video.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.240]  Did we?
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:26:59.920]  Did we?
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:00.380]  Did we?
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.780]  Not the convoy.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.280]  We stole the bikes.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.120]  Right.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:17.240]  I can't listen to Lester again about...
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.200]  Live and don't listen.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:20.140]  Okay.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.200]  Ow!
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:22.420]  Oh!
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:33.220]  Oh, he says move and fire.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.860]  Oh my god.
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:36.560]  Oh, nice threat.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.900]  That was close.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.040]  That was really good.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.820]  Nice work, fellas.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.140]  He's giving it some heat.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:50.860]  Where's this one going?
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.220]  There we go.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:55.840]  Just watch your health.
[01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:56.560]  Watch your armor.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:00.700]  Jesus.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.400]  It's not a cop car.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.200]  That is.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.780]  Sometimes I'm just trying to empty my clip to reload it.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.180]  I'm just firing at the ground.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:12.760]  Oh, fuck.
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.380]  Ooh!
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:16.320]  That was lucky.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:18.740]  Okay, come up.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.000]  He's gonna crest the hill.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.020]  Oh my god.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.880]  He got reamed by a hatchback.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.520]  Gotta go this way.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.800]  Don't have a choice.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.320]  I know, don't have a choice. Sorry.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.560]  That cop car nearly landed on us.
[01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:48.650]  Be careful, Nick.
[01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:48.990]  Be careful.
[01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:51.190]  God, there's so many right here.
[01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:52.030]  What the fuck?
[01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:54.010]  I'm alright.
[01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.730]  Thank you.
[01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:58.450]  Oh, nice boost.
[01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:03.630]  I had to switch over to snacks because I'm out of armor.
[01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:06.670]  Fuck me.
[01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:07.550]  Oh shit.
[01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:09.610]  Oh my god.
[01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:10.610]  It is tight.
[01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:12.710]  They didn't take the jump.
[01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:13.890]  Nope.
[01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:17.030]  I had to swerve off because Nick was getting fucked up.
[01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:19.230]  I was getting obliterated.
[01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:21.250]  How you doing, Gavin?
[01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:22.390]  Pretty good.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.580]  I think this is the part of the run
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.220]  where I say it's looking pretty good right now.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:31.760]  Gavin, no!
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.540]  That guy dropped like a whack-a-mole.
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:40.360]  It's real bad, just so you guys know.
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:41.680]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.980]  Oh, it's real bad.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:45.960]  Oh, hey fellas.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:46.360]  We're right behind you.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:48.420]  Oh shit.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.220]  Chopper.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.060]  Oh my god.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.180]  Almost died the same way.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:00.240]  Okay.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.060]  Feeling the vibrations.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:06.860]  Are we good?
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.220]  Good, good, good.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:10.560]  No.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.740]  Oh!
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:16.700]  We're good.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.080]  Alright, let's watch out.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:24.520]  Oh my god.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:25.920]  They took a tumble.
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:30.880]  Alright.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:31.760]  Good shooting.
[01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:35.120]  Alright, I'm going to close out of this menu.
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:37.860]  Eatin'.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:39.040]  What's open shoot? A?
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.720]  A. Yeah.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:41.380]  Alright.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.280]  I was a little gun-shy because last time I hit A
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.600]  I ate fucking sandwiches!
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.060]  Oh, hikers. Look out.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:56.960]  We're fine.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.000]  Gavin, we talked about this.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.820]  He wasn't in a car.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.740]  Did you kill the hikers, Gavin?
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.160]  Actually, a little bit.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:09.720]  Tried.
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.340]  Alright, here comes the silent concentration.
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.980]  That's where I'm at.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.040]  I'm locked in.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:29.160]  Now, remember when we
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.100]  land down by the boat?
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.400]  Oh shit.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.480]  When we land down by the boat,
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.820]  we all need to get in the boat.
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.120]  If you get in the driver's seat,
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:39.820]  do not take off.
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:42.920]  Come on now.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.100]  Whatever's going on over there, we'll pull it together.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.140]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:48.460]  I was launched off the motorcycle.
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:49.620]  What?
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:52.840]  We're alive. We're okay.
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:56.420]  Are you alright?
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:57.900]  Hi guys.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.540]  On my screen it looked like you were on wires
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.900]  in a Kung Fu movie. You just flew off the back.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:06.240]  Here we go.
[01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:10.380]  Close your windows, folks.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.140]  I'm so glad you didn't
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.400]  drive off right there.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.300]  Oh shit!
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.640]  No!
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.780]  Oh no.
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:29.620]  No!
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.980]  Oh no.
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.000]  What?
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:41.940]  I'm in a real predicament.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.120]  What?
[01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:50.880]  Gavin, what?
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.860]  Did you shoot your chute
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.320]  and now you're stuck in the mountains?
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.880]  We jumped off
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.580]  and my chute opened
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.580]  when we were pointed backwards and I went straight into
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.600]  the cliff. And now I'm just stood up
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.520]  on the side of the cliff.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.620]  Alright, let's see if I can get
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:11.880]  down.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.120]  I gotta ease it.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:16.700]  I gotta ease it.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.520]  Where's the shortest way down?
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:20.100]  Oh my god.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.360]  Can you see him through a scope of a rifle?
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.100]  Oh.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.420]  Gavin died.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:35.800]  That was the end!
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.400]  Oh no.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:41.760]  Oh no.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.180]  Gavin, where do you think it takes us?
[01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:54.470]  Well, maybe since we were
[01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:55.550]  in the dang...
[01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:01.430]  Holy shit.
[01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:17.750]  Oh my god.
[01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:19.170]  I'd like to formally apologize
[01:34:19.170 --> 01:34:20.570]  to everyone involved.
[01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:26.370]  I got the tears coming.
[01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:29.290]  Oh, I got
[01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.990]  tears.
[01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:31.970]  Oh, I'm
[01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:32.370]  crying.
[01:34:38.690 --> 01:34:39.930]  The exact same thing
[01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:41.810]  happened to me, Gavin, but I was able to course correct
[01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:43.870]  out of it and the entire time I was just thinking
[01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:46.010]  please have him hit it if I'm gonna hit
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.470]  it too.
[01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:48.710]  But I dodged it.
[01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:50.790]  I just shot off backwards. I came facing
[01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:52.870]  the cliff. Did I dive
[01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:54.890]  too soon? You jumped off before
[01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:56.850]  me. Like, I thought that you were good.
[01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:58.350]  Me too.
[01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:00.810]  That was... I ended up on like
[01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:02.250]  a hundred foot up ledge.
[01:35:04.190 --> 01:35:04.970]  Oh, fuck
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:06.690]  me. Oh, fucking hey.
[01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.710]  You guys remember this part? Yeah, I do.
[01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:11.570]  Oh, do I?
[01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:14.810]  Oh, Gavin just now decided to start
[01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:15.070]  shooting.
[01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:21.530]  Could've used
[01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:22.490]  you a little earlier there, bud.
[01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:26.290]  The chopper
[01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:28.290]  flew into a tree.
[01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:32.090]  Did it blow up?
[01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:34.750]  No, it just bounced off a fucking tree.
[01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:44.810]  Editor, take
[01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:45.770]  all this stuff out.
[01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:48.950]  Just take
[01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:50.190]  all this out.
[01:35:50.410 --> 01:35:51.630]  Just erase all of it.
[01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:53.870]  It's in. It's all in.
[01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:55.590]  All of it out. Just do it
[01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:57.290]  so it looks like we did it the first time.
[01:35:58.290 --> 01:35:59.630]  When Nick eats sandwiches
[01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:01.490]  on the way to his death, cut to when
[01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:03.950]  we all went off with our parachute, normal style.
[01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:05.790]  We haven't done that yet. We don't know if that's gonna
[01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.690]  happen. Yeah, should we have
[01:36:07.690 --> 01:36:09.210]  like a Liah's cut of this video?
[01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:11.050]  Oh, I like that.
[01:36:11.050 --> 01:36:11.770]  Get...
[01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:14.830]  Get on the bike.
[01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:16.190]  Get on the bike.
[01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:17.430]  Get on the bike.
[01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:19.250]  I fell.
[01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:21.990]  I'm losing it.
[01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:29.270]  I suddenly got hot and I need to shit.
[01:36:35.530 --> 01:36:36.730]  I gotta pee though.
[01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:39.690]  These games, they affect my large intestine, I think.
[01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.790]  Oh!
[01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:49.700]  Oh, we are so dead.
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.340]  Hop in, hop in, hop in.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.180]  Not dead until...
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:54.700]  Okay, now we're dead.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:00.080]  Gavin jumped off.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.800]  Why does it keep letting me respawn
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.100]  and then it tells me we failed?
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.140]  That's funny.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.100]  You think there's a counter?
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.180]  Is there a counter for how many times we've done this?
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:15.900]  One, this is the first time.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:18.240]  For some reason
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.420]  the money take is just really, really, really low.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.160]  We should just
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.460]  get stealing money, honestly.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.880]  We would be close to zero.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:26.800]  We'd have to be.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.500]  Potential cut? I wonder what the real cut is gonna be.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.100]  Well, it's already down to
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.060]  200 something.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:38.960]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.530]  Alright.
[01:37:45.930 --> 01:37:47.830]  I won't hit Gavin this time.
[01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:51.630]  He actually got on the bike.
[01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:53.170]  Hey, I can't believe it either.
[01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:54.530]  That's a good sign.
[01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.510]  I'm locked in.
[01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:08.120]  We had a good couple of audio
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.000]  messages to each other last night, didn't we?
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:11.620]  Yeah, that was pretty good.
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.460]  Me and Gavin are audio message guys again.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.240]  What brought you back?
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.560]  I was just letting
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.380]  Gavin know about a salad.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:21.040]  My wife said, hey, you should send Gavin a message
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.240]  about the salad you ate. And I went, that's a great idea,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:25.060]  honey. And so I sent Gavin
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.060]  a message about the salad I ate. What kind of salad did you get?
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.060]  It was just sort of like
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.000]  a chopped kale, whatever, but it had like this
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.220]  citrus dressing that I really
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.280]  liked. Yeah, it was nice.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.700]  Gavin couldn't understand why I would be on the lookout
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.940]  for a dressing, but you know,
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.920]  it is what it is. Dressing's like sauce, Gavin.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.960]  It's good. No, I understand
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.040]  the concept of dressing.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.900]  How do you die every time you fall off?
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:51.980]  I don't understand.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.580]  Do you not have any health or armor?
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.560]  My health's full.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.860]  It might be that you're so low level you have
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.280]  a tiny amount of health.
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.780]  Yes, I think that's right. Also, I want to blame
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:04.940]  LilLegLu
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.140]  who just sent me a friend request
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.740]  and is going to get blocked by me
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.960]  on Instagram. When that happened,
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.980]  it was a pop-up on my screen at the
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:15.280]  worst time. So, LilLegLu,
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.320]  thank you so much.
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:18.740]  That one's on you.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.780]  That's great. Whatever you said,
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.740]  Erik, a friend request, you have that possibility.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:24.880]  And just know,
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.160]  and I told this to Andrew earlier, when you send me a friend request,
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.320]  I simply block you.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:30.740]  You block who?
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.960]  Yeah, they had a chance to maybe
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.900]  see what he was doing. I'm not
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:37.120]  friends with them. Don't add me as a friend.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.200]  You don't even know him.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.120]  Right. Yes, yeah, Gavin.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.480]  Sounds like we're saying the same thing.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.760]  Are you friends with Spummer?
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.240]  He knows Spummer.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.460]  We know Spummer.
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.380]  Spummer.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.140]  I told Spummer that he could be the one that can
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.060]  be friends with me. No one else.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.200]  It's just for Spummer. I'm friends with Spummer.
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.000]  I need to re-add Spummer
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.860]  because he fucked up
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:01.880]  our system for some reason
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.620]  when we did mini-golf.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.000]  He fucked up our system?
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.980]  Yeah, like we wouldn't let us sign in on
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.600]  Xbox because we added him.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.580]  I forgot about that.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.900]  You had too many friends.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.920]  He was like 101th friend.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.720]  I don't have that problem.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:17.140]  What a jam up!
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.100]  That was a jam up, boys.
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:22.200]  That was insane.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.420]  G-mini Christmas.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:25.900]  Woo!
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.700]  Okay, well...
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:30.520]  Okay, let's see.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:32.460]  Where'd that guy go?
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.460]  Vanished. Will you die?
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:35.520]  Holy shit!
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.440]  Are we down?
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:47.100]  You guys okay?
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:48.900]  Nice.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.300]  Holy shit. Ow. Damn.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.580]  Ow, damn bollocks.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:55.920]  Ow, my frickin' arm.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.760]  I can't...
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:58.340]  Ow!
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.660]  I'm gonna piss my pants.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.340]  Wait a second, where'd Gavin go?
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.740]  I lost all my armor.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:12.320]  It went.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.680]  There was one guy just shooting it off every time I put it on.
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:16.220]  He shot it off.
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:18.540]  It's like a slap fight.
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.660]  How many times?
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:23.940]  I don't know.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.300]  I've pulled the parachute once.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:31.220]  I have also pulled the parachute once.
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:31.420]  Two for two.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.320]  Were you all in the dinghy?
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.100]  Eric and I were.
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:36.480]  Yeah, me and Andrew were.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.160]  I was almost there.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.820]  You think GTA 6 will be out by the time we finish this?
[01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:53.050]  You tried to get on there.
[01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:56.090]  At least it's the finale of the original heists.
[01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:57.830]  This is living up to expectations.
[01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:59.090]  The worst video we've ever made?
[01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:02.010]  You said that about Full Spectrum Warrior.
[01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:02.630]  Look at it.
[01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:04.170]  And I agree with that too.
[01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:07.590]  This is now taking the mantle
[01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:09.970]  as an active gamer situation.
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.600]  It'll be Thanksgiving by the time we're done with this.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.640]  We're struggling,
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:26.840]  but after the Gears of War thing
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.880]  that Gavin and I went...
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.060]  I don't know if you feel the same way, Gavin.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:31.320]  This isn't even close to as broken
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.200]  as I felt in that series at times.
[01:42:33.700 --> 01:42:34.180]  Is it right?
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:37.060]  This feels like a breeze.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.020]  That was not a cop.
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:47.240]  I felt like he was moving like one.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:51.800]  He had caught movements?
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:52.400]  Yeah.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:55.220]  Rant up!
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:57.660]  Congrats, man.
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:42:58.900]  Way to go, dude.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.820]  I put on armor
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:05.520]  and it was gone in a split second.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.860]  Yeah, Gavin, what's up?
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:09.600]  You were just doing weird shit.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.380]  I was driving.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.000]  The car pulled out in front of me.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.940]  One of those was a cop.
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:25.300]  Oh, that wasn't.
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:31.020]  Uh...
[01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:37.880]  Oh, bollocks!
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:38.940]  Okay, we're alright.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:46.800]  Nick, I don't know where we're going,
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:47.780]  but we're going to figure it out.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.280]  Oh, you could have gone through that gate.
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.820]  None of those were cops?
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:52.740]  Looks like a cop.
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:55.420]  Oh!
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.980]  That was the worst case.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:43:59.740]  We're going to die.
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.560]  There's just no way.
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:02.920]  No, we're dead.
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:03.980]  Nope.
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.120]  Guys.
[01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.720]  Don't guys us.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.240]  Okay, don't guys me.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.000]  Now you're learning.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:21.680]  I refuse to accept that, guys.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:24.480]  It was just an outburst, guys.
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.320]  Like, we don't die on this bit,
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.360]  but we die on the parachute bit.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:28.940]  Come on now.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.440]  Two times.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.200]  What sucks about our bikes is
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.200]  they don't break fences or anything.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.180]  Like, if you try to go through a fence,
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:37.900]  it just fucks you up.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.100]  So you have to try to navigate them,
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:39.960]  and it makes it so much harder.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.760]  If you boost, it might go through.
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.400]  Yeah, we also might die.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.820]  Well, I want to save the boost for the parachute
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:47.200]  so we get as much air as we can.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.360]  The boost comes back.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.440]  No, I haven't...
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.480]  Yeah, it comes back, yes.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:55.080]  It's the yellow bar at the bottom on the old map.
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.320]  Just try it.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.100]  Try what?
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.220]  We're telling you what it does.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.500]  Yeah, it absolutely comes back.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.220]  You might have to burn out it back
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.880]  by doing gnarly shit.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.920]  See, that's why I've never been able to recharge it.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.380]  It takes time to come back, but it...
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:12.760]  What are we supposed to do about that, Gamma?
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.100]  Oh!
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:14.880]  Oh!
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.400]  What the fuck?
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.740]  What is going on over here?
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:23.100]  Andrew's dead.
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.120]  Who's came back?
[01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:35.950]  I was level 30 when we started this.
[01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:37.870]  You're going to start this video
[01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:39.850]  knowing that we just have to do one part
[01:45:39.850 --> 01:45:41.450]  and then the heist, and they're going to wonder
[01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:42.850]  why it's two and a half hours long.
[01:45:43.650 --> 01:45:45.790]  Guys, don't watch this video.
[01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:47.330]  If you're this mean, what are you doing?
[01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:50.370]  You want them to turn it off an hour and 50 minutes in?
[01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:51.450]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:51.610 --> 01:45:53.790]  I think right now, I think this is where
[01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:54.910]  you should call it quits.
[01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:57.830]  If you're still watching this,
[01:45:59.050 --> 01:46:00.090]  now's a good time
[01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:01.050]  to get off this video.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.180]  Oh, use the bikes to get away from the cops?
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:12.720]  Good idea. I hadn't thought of that the first time.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:12.940]  Alright.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:21.280]  You piece of shit.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:37.320]  Huh.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.220]  Alright.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.260]  No roadblocks so far.
[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.360]  Oh, we got a huge one coming up.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.280]  We're going to have a fucking problem coming up.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.480]  That dude hit a cop.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.200]  Holy shit.
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.700]  Damn, that sucked.
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:57.220]  Fuck.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:59.680]  Uh-oh. I'm stuck.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.880]  We're alive, we're alive, we're alive.
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:04.040]  Oh, we're not going to be for very long.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:04.940]  Get in.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.440]  Go, go, go. Damn it.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.940]  Did you, uh...
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.740]  Eric, did you play my reply to your small wife?
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:25.780]  Yes, she liked it very much.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.940]  She thought it was very, very funny.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.100]  I'm like, whoa, it's really echoey.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:32.480]  He must be far away from his phone.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:35.680]  He was not far away from his phone.
[01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:37.260]  Was he in the bathroom?
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:38.480]  Yes, he was.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:44.160]  The toilet flush at the end was very loud.
[01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:54.180]  Oh, he's gotten really good at that.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.560]  That was clean.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:57.840]  That was nice.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:01.140]  What you got there, Gavin?
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:02.140]  Do it.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.180]  Yeah, some stuff.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.400]  Sticky stuff.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.740]  Trying to get him a turbo, man.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:20.660]  Are you, like, faking him out?
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:21.300]  What are you doing?
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:23.300]  I'm throwing him.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:25.480]  Oh, are you? I don't see him coming out of your hand.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:27.940]  I am.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:30.000]  Cinematic as hell, though.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:32.520]  Oh, that one might have done it.
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:33.340]  I think that's on the wheel.
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:35.700]  I think it's on the tire.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.640]  At least don't kill us.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:41.720]  Gotta keep our wheel close to them.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.120]  It's on the wheel!
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:43.460]  Oh!
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:45.520]  Whoa!
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:49.860]  Okay, we're not dead.
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.280]  We're not dead.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.720]  Go, go!
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.380]  Well, the bike blew up.
[01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:57.420]  Gavin!
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:48:58.740]  Gavin!
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:00.640]  Nick died, I died.
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.000]  You piece of shit!
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.560]  Oh, God!
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.100]  We got knocked off the bike.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.880]  We ran back to get on the bike.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.360]  And then your C4 went off.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.280]  And since nobody was on it, it just detonated the whole bike.
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.380]  It just blew up.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.220]  What if we take cars?
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.900]  I would prefer the car.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.560]  Why don't we take the armored car?
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:33.760]  There's a cop car parked right on the street.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.020]  Let's go get it.
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:35.800]  Let's do it.
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:39.320]  Let's take the bikes to get the cop car.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.120]  Let's try it.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:43.440]  I'm just gonna take my own bike to get to it.
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:44.700]  This is so crazy.
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.340]  The hills are gonna be such a nightmare.
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.780]  It's gonna be bad. Who's driving?
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:49.760]  Andrew.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:52.320]  Okay, sure.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.620]  What if we swap every attempt?
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:55.320]  Sure.
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:49:59.240]  It'll let us get out.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:00.980]  Can we swap?
[01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:03.520]  Andrew, get in?
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:03.980]  Yeah.
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.140]  No, it's locked!
[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.420]  It's locked, we gotta...
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.460]  Come on, Gavin.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:13.240]  Get on the bike, you absolute...
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:15.620]  sausage casing.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:17.920]  You're talking to you.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:18.680]  I know!
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:19.320]  Yep.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:23.800]  So can we not get in any car?
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:24.880]  I guess not.
[01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:30.050]  What the fuck?
[01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.470]  Whoa!
[01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:33.270]  Is that the way you guys usually go?
[01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:35.510]  No, I just wanted to get a reaction out of people.
[01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.850]  It worked.
[01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:38.350]  That was insane.
[01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:39.410]  Really cool.
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:46.220]  Shut up, Lester! Shut up!
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:47.720]  Shut up! Shut up!
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:50.840]  Oh, fuck me.
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.580]  Oh, fuck that guy!
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.700]  We got clipped.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.320]  You alive?
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:50:59.460]  You alive?
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.340]  They're right back there!
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.440]  Get on, get on!
[01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:10.770]  Aaron, please.
[01:51:11.130 --> 01:51:12.110]  Yeah, shut the fuck up.
[01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:16.970]  That is an unusual place for a roadblock.
[01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:18.850]  Just so you guys know, coming up.
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.800]  Oh, they're following us off-road, that's awesome!
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:31.560]  He's bound down,
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:32.940]  loaded up and truckin'.
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:34.040]  You got hit by a tree.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:35.760]  Woo!
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:37.940]  Woo-hoo-hoo!
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.000]  Looking good around here.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.000]  Man, that chopper
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.580]  really, really wants to mess with us.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.060]  Yeah, just keep shooting at it.
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:53.580]  Yep.
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:57.220]  Oh, sign.
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:51:58.180]  We're okay.
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:00.780]  Oh, house!
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:03.820]  Took it a little soon.
[01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:04.280]  Sorry, bud.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:06.940]  Thought that was the wash.
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:07.740]  I was wrong.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.360]  Whoa!
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.660]  Back to snacks.
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.420]  Alright, watch your health, watch your armor.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.080]  Whoa!
[01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:26.690]  Lester, we get it!
[01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.950]  Yeah!
[01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:31.910]  Bounced off the sign this time.
[01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:33.010]  Didn't quite land it.
[01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:34.270]  Oh!
[01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:39.470]  I got, you know how you guys talked about the weak spine thing?
[01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:40.190]  Yeah.
[01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:43.470]  Yeah, they hit me with their car
[01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:44.650]  and it caused enough damage.
[01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:46.790]  You're level 100 and whatever.
[01:52:47.230 --> 01:52:48.890]  You should have a thick spine.
[01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:51.290]  Long back.
[01:52:51.810 --> 01:52:53.490]  Long back, thick spine.
[01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:55.590]  It is weird because it doesn't even send you
[01:52:55.590 --> 01:52:57.530]  off your bike, but it's like they're hitting you
[01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:58.770]  without being on a vehicle.
[01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:01.270]  That's the way the game factors in.
[01:53:01.590 --> 01:53:02.670]  Okay, well I didn't.
[01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:05.490]  He smashed us
[01:53:05.490 --> 01:53:06.530]  into that guard rail.
[01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:08.890]  He was just driving faster than us from behind.
[01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:10.150]  Yeah, that's how...
[01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.270]  I can't believe we survived the beginning of that, Gavin.
[01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:13.030]  That's how cars work against motorcycles.
[01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.190]  I like that we have a boosted motorcycle
[01:53:16.190 --> 01:53:18.150]  and a dude in a cop car is able to keep up with us
[01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:19.410]  and go faster than us.
[01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:22.550]  Those bikes suck.
[01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:23.690]  Yeah, they do.
[01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:26.590]  I bet there is a car we can get.
[01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:28.050]  Oh, this is insane.
[01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:29.170]  What's happening here?
[01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:31.170]  Gavin got on a different bike.
[01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:31.810]  I missed.
[01:53:33.150 --> 01:53:33.550]  Okay.
[01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:35.130]  So here we go.
[01:53:35.150 --> 01:53:38.470]  Well, here we go.
[01:53:44.490 --> 01:53:44.890]  Gavin
[01:53:44.890 --> 01:53:46.170]  just got off his bike.
[01:53:46.350 --> 01:53:48.370]  Did it work? He's trying to get a car.
[01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:49.010]  Did it work?
[01:53:50.850 --> 01:53:51.770]  I don't know.
[01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:54.990]  The bikes are so much faster when you are just one person
[01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.630]  on them. Is that true?
[01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:57.670]  They get bogged down?
[01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:00.250]  Maybe we...
[01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:03.290]  Maybe we...
[01:54:04.650 --> 01:54:05.490]  You guys have been
[01:54:05.490 --> 01:54:07.710]  fucking us this whole time and we didn't know it.
[01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:09.190]  I don't think so. I think that
[01:54:09.190 --> 01:54:10.330]  two person system works fine.
[01:54:10.630 --> 01:54:12.650]  I feel like I live longer with two people.
[01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:13.450]  Yeah, me too.
[01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:17.050]  Hey, Gavin. Hey, what's up fellas?
[01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:18.670]  Did you get a car?
[01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:19.390]  He did.
[01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:22.610]  Ah!
[01:54:24.690 --> 01:54:25.490]  The cop
[01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:27.530]  was bent over, cowering
[01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:28.590]  and you hit him full on.
[01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:31.050]  Oh shit!
[01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:33.770]  Holy
[01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:35.210]  mother of god!
[01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:41.170]  Good luck, Gavin. Thanks, son.
[01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:45.050]  I'm guessing because...
[01:54:45.610 --> 01:54:47.390]  No! The tree!
[01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.690]  We're okay.
[01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:50.530]  We're alright.
[01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:52.410]  Okay.
[01:54:53.050 --> 01:54:55.050]  I'm guessing because it's a convertible, you can just hop in.
[01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:57.230]  I think
[01:54:57.230 --> 01:54:59.370]  it was that specific police car that was locked.
[01:54:59.370 --> 01:54:59.490]  Okay.
[01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:02.970]  Mission placed car. Bullshit.
[01:55:03.450 --> 01:55:04.010]  Got it.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.840]  I don't even know where Eric is.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.500]  I'm right behind you. Okay.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.280]  Oh, come on.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  Yeah, the driver takes
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.060]  way more damage when it's just you by yourself.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.200]  That's for sure.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.400]  Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:34.680]  I'm fucked.
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:35.880]  Sorry.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.860]  All good. Nick is breaking
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.220]  the rules and firing his grenade launcher everywhere.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:44.940]  I didn't have to put on armor
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:46.940]  once. Okay, so should we
[01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:48.900]  just go and then try to grab a car?
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:49.480]  Yeah.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:53.060]  I think if you see a fast car, go for it.
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.240]  I'll go.
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.180]  Let's just go together. We'll see if we can grab a car.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.480]  I was talking about me and Gavin.
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:01.100]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.520]  I'm wondering how does the jumping
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:06.400]  parachute part work with the car?
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.700]  Yeah, I'm worried about the hills.
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.000]  Let's see.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:15.680]  Sounds like a bridge we'll cross when we get to it.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.260]  Yeah, I was going to say, what are we worried about?
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:20.240]  Doing it again? Yeah, it sounds like a bridge
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:22.280]  we'll jump off when we get to it. Oh, you know what?
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:22.900]  Brilliant.
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.240]  I'm going to stay on the bike, I think.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:28.240]  Why does nonce mean
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:28.700]  pedophile?
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:30.620]  I don't know.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.260]  Why does pedophile mean pet song?
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:34.640]  Well, pedo.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.260]  Alright. Kid.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:39.920]  So a pedo tube.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:40.980]  Is a kid tube?
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:44.640]  What is a pedo tube?
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:45.740]  In a submarine.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.700]  That's spelt different though, isn't it? Is it?
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:55.500]  Although on a British submarine it is called a nonce pipe.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:04.820]  Sorry about that.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.160]  I wanted to take that car, but it ain't happening.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.660]  Why don't we just take this?
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:13.480]  Sounds good.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:14.140]  Good luck, fellas.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:15.480]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.580]  You dead? Yeah.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.460]  I think the spot to get the car
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.480]  is before we get to the point.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.380]  I think we just have to go left or right
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:27.720]  and grab it.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.040]  When are we going to start the doomsday heist?
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.520]  We'll have to do a lunch and come back.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:41.100]  I ate a late breakfast because I knew this would happen.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.360]  You okay, Eric?
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:48.100]  Alright, we got all this money, guys. Let's do it.
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.160]  He wasn't listening before that.
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.940]  Hey, Andrew, how much was in your bank account on the ATM?
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.020]  I didn't get a chance to see.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.640]  It pulled me out. Now we're talking.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:58.580]  Alright, I got Gavin now. Let's do it.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:57:59.960]  Do it.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:10.480]  Oh!
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:15.880]  Fucking A!
[01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:21.710]  What?
[01:58:23.630 --> 01:58:24.650]  Back at it.
[01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.970]  Oh, shit.
[01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:30.890]  Oh, shit. Eric.
[01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:32.230]  What are you doing?
[01:58:32.230 --> 01:58:34.230]  Holy shit.
[01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:40.210]  That was really close.
[01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:42.230]  You're crazy.
[01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:44.250]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:45.510]  No, this is good.
[01:58:46.590 --> 01:58:47.870]  It's a great thing.
[01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:52.410]  Hang on. What is this thing called?
[01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:55.190]  National Office of
[01:58:55.190 --> 01:58:56.590]  Security Enforcement
[01:58:56.590 --> 01:58:58.010]  LSPD
[01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:59.170]  Armored Vehicle.
[01:58:59.810 --> 01:59:01.330]  You got the armored vehicle?
[01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:02.750]  Yeah, hop in, guys.
[01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:05.190]  It's taking a pounding, and
[01:59:05.190 --> 01:59:07.010]  I'm not having any issues with the armor.
[01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:08.470]  I mean, the back
[01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:10.370]  left tire's gone.
[01:59:10.970 --> 01:59:12.570]  Oh, is it? Oh, shit.
[01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:15.110]  Yeah, the
[01:59:15.110 --> 01:59:16.090]  tires are a problem.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.080]  Are you shooting, Eric?
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:21.760]  No.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:25.000]  I'm looking at the map to see
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.960]  if there's a better way to go, but I just
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.700]  don't think there is.
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:29.700]  He does mention that you could
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:31.140]  go wherever you want, but this is the
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.000]  best way.
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:35.660]  I mean, all you would do is take
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:37.460]  the Pacific Coast Highway out west.
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:39.700]  Hey,
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.660]  Gavin? Yeah? I don't know if
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.700]  the car is working for
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.420]  us. This one's not great.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.280]  I'll give you that.
[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.760]  Maybe if you just shoot the cops.
[01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:51.540]  You think I should be shooting the cops?
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:53.380]  Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:55.500]  Oh, the chopper just went down.
[02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.360]  Oh, killed the driver. Excellent. Nice.
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.880]  You should get out of here.
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:19.160]  Yep.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:21.120]  That looked cool, though.
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.220]  And here comes the
[02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:27.040]  bus. Oh, shit, there goes another wheel.
[02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:36.250]  You almost got it. The front one going, that's bad
[02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:37.670]  news. There you go. Oh, boy.
[02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:40.270]  Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[02:00:40.590 --> 02:00:40.850]  Okay.
[02:00:43.610 --> 02:00:44.190]  Let's see if I can
[02:00:44.190 --> 02:00:45.250]  help them a little. There we go.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:55.240]  Nice.
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:57.140]  Nice.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:57.920]  Oh.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.940]  That was tight.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:03.360]  The bridge is a cluster,
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.060]  guys. Yeah, it's real bad.
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:07.420]  The bridge? What bridge?
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.620]  The one where the convoy
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:10.400]  ambush happened.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:13.200]  Oh, yeah, yeah. Where is that?
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:15.380]  Do you know
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:17.360]  like the beginning? Yeah, I'm
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.840]  familiar with it. Yeah, we're like there.
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.000]  Getting some speed now.
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.300]  Hell yeah, bud.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.960]  Yeah, Gavin.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.420]  Rat mode, baby. Let's go.
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.200]  No weak spines
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.360]  here. Spines
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.020]  are solid.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:52.060]  Oops.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.220]  Well, that sounded promising.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:57.660]  Still good.
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.720]  Okay, good. Still great.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.740]  The cops are almost
[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:03.320]  off of us.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:08.200]  Oh, we almost lost them.
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:10.940]  Don't forget to
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:12.800]  switch off the menu when you eventually
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.020]  get to the mountain. Menu? No one's
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:15.780]  touching us here, buddy.
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:18.260]  Did you guys lose the
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:20.380]  wanted level? No.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:23.500]  All
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:24.300]  right. Well, you don't have to worry about
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.340]  a guy in the mountains. Oh, Gavin, we
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.080]  had all the momentum in the world, man. Yeah,
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.860]  that's going to be hard to recover from.
[02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:35.210]  We had all that downhill power.
[02:02:35.690 --> 02:02:35.910]  Yep.
[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:44.000]  How's it going up ahead, guys?
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.280]  We're about to jump off the cliff.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.800]  Maybe we can meet them somewhere
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:53.100]  where they get the... Witnesses!
[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:54.520]  They were hikers.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.560]  Maybe we can meet
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.980]  them somewhere where they can bring the boat.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.480]  Here we go, Nick. You ready?
[02:03:06.570 --> 02:03:07.670]  All right, deploying chute.
[02:03:08.050 --> 02:03:08.310]  Yep.
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:15.080]  Look at us.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:16.660]  Boat!
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:17.660]  Boat!
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:20.620]  Oh, I just ate a boat.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.000]  Yeah, that was tough. To be fair, we could
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:23.760]  use that dinghy.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.660]  That could just be ours.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.180]  Deploy it.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:31.340]  Have you ever pushed one of those
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:33.040]  into the water? I wonder if it actually floats.
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.620]  So you guys are in the dinghy?
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:40.840]  Not yet, we're on our way.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:45.920]  It's really picturesque out here, though.
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:47.080]  Really nice.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.280]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:52.860]  Damn, I'm on land.
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:53.940]  There we go.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:56.380]  Headed to the dinghy.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.460]  Come in.
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:06.680]  Oh, they put a cone down.
[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:14.040]  Hello, old chap.
[02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:14.780]  Hello.
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:17.420]  Where are they?
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:19.820]  Coming up to the old convoy bridge.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.220]  Okay, so guys, you remember when you said the bridge was
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.100]  pretty hairy? We're there now.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:25.160]  I see that.
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:28.540]  Oh, look, yeah.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.820]  I'm gonna mark you as a point of interest.
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:35.240]  You guys have three minutes, 20 seconds to get here.
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:36.760]  Why is there a timer?
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:38.700]  What do you mean?
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.860]  Oh, no, I didn't know there was a timer.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.180]  Was there always a timer?
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.440]  Oh, no.
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:45.940]  What if?
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.880]  That would be some shit, wouldn't it?
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.500]  What do you mean, what if?
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:53.100]  What if what?
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.080]  Alright, Eric, what we do
[02:04:55.080 --> 02:04:57.080]  when we get to the tunnel,
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.140]  we get in that car.
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:00.180]  Take the Suburban?
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:00.600]  Yeah.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:00.940]  Yeah.
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:03.320]  We're almost there.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:06.780]  We shot the rangers in the park, so you should be alright.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.400]  Is that how this works?
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.620]  I mean...
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:13.720]  They're not gonna make it.
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:15.880]  There's no way.
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:17.780]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.420]  Like Nick said, what if?
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:22.340]  What if you made it?
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:24.600]  That'd be awesome.
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:25.540]  Yeah.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:26.560]  I'd be pretty excited.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:34.380]  Why are you mad?
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:35.660]  I will say, this is very safe.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.220]  Did you get the Suburban?
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:41.900]  I can see it.
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:42.940]  We're almost there.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:46.080]  I don't think we can go up this hill.
[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:47.580]  I don't think we can go up this hill.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:48.940]  We might have to bail and run.
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:50.740]  Bail and run?
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:53.560]  Alright, two minutes.
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:55.020]  Okay, get out.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:56.340]  We'll get in this one.
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:58.480]  Let's go.
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:00.520]  Alright, sod the Suburban.
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:01.220]  Yep.
[02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.080]  Fire up the roof, baby!
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.340]  Oh, y'all are moving now.
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:09.600]  Now we're cooking.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:13.580]  Yeah, but we have so much that we have to climb.
[02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:17.020]  Nino, Nino, Nino!
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:20.480]  Do you think...
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.620]  Once they get to the boat...
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:24.620]  Yeah, I was thinking that.
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:25.360]  I don't know.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.240]  I hope so.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.280]  Is it total?
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:28.880]  We don't know.
[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:31.220]  Went the wrong way.
[02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.220]  No such thing as wrong.
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:43.760]  70 seconds.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  Can we land
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.700]  in the dinghy from the jump?
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:53.340]  No.
[02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:58.740]  I wonder if I can get to land and see you.
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:07.200]  It's not the right way.
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:08.360]  Shortcut.
[02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:17.790]  We're at the cannibal compound.
[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:18.710]  Gavin took a shortcut.
[02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:21.890]  We got the dicks out, guys.
[02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:25.550]  30 seconds.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:33.700]  20.
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.520]  How's that shortcut going?
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.860]  It's good. So far, so good.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:42.860]  Oh, yeah?
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:43.900]  Yeah.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:45.400]  And parachute!
[02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:55.270]  I just have to pee.
[02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:57.530]  Too bad.
[02:07:58.050 --> 02:07:59.410]  You should have pulled your parachute
[02:07:59.410 --> 02:08:00.370]  45 minutes ago.
[02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:02.470]  Okay, listen.
[02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:04.350]  The P's and Q's, Eric.
[02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.970]  But Eric crashed, or not you.
[02:08:07.230 --> 02:08:08.310]  Geoff, not really.
[02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:10.030]  Are you Andrew?
[02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.910]  Are you okay?
[02:08:11.010 --> 02:08:12.850]  You might have to bail on your point.
[02:08:13.210 --> 02:08:14.810]  You might have to bail on your point.
[02:08:14.970 --> 02:08:17.170]  I'm the only one that is okay.
[02:08:18.450 --> 02:08:19.730]  It's no longer Nick's
[02:08:19.730 --> 02:08:21.770]  only fault, because Gavin...
[02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:23.270]  Gavin also crashed.
[02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:25.330]  Mine was way worse.
[02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:29.910]  Nick got screwed
[02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:31.730]  by the UI. I got screwed by my
[02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:33.390]  incompetence.
[02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:35.850]  I think cars are the way, though.
[02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:37.310]  What?
[02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:39.090]  That was your
[02:08:39.090 --> 02:08:40.290]  takeaway from that?
[02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:43.150]  Let's see how long
[02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:44.570]  we actually have once the timer starts.
[02:08:45.450 --> 02:08:46.310]  I'm curious.
[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:47.650]  10 minutes.
[02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.470]  Yep.
[02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:52.650]  I'm not getting a car, Gavin.
[02:08:52.810 --> 02:08:53.350]  We're going.
[02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.650]  Okay.
[02:08:57.590 --> 02:08:59.130]  Where do you want me to drop you?
[02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.590]  Right here?
[02:09:07.370 --> 02:09:09.170]  Let me reopen my
[02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:11.350]  body armor window.
[02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:12.230]  It's already gone.
[02:09:14.030 --> 02:09:14.590]  Well.
[02:09:15.650 --> 02:09:17.350]  We're going to do it
[02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.810]  one more time.
[02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:19.410]  What happened?
[02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:22.530]  I was too close to them when we were going,
[02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:25.010]  and a car evaded,
[02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:26.650]  and I ran into it.
[02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:29.130]  Yeah. Restart.
[02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:33.110]  Is this the longest video we've ever made?
[02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:33.730]  No.
[02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:34.470]  No.
[02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:36.870]  What's the longest video we've ever made?
[02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.810]  The what?
[02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:41.450]  There's some nearly three-hour
[02:09:41.450 --> 02:09:42.230]  Gears videos.
[02:09:42.730 --> 02:09:45.610]  So if you like this, sign up for our Patreon.
[02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:47.570]  So you guys are like
[02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:49.850]  into this. You're like masochists.
[02:09:52.970 --> 02:09:53.270]  Yeah.
[02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:55.150]  I often have to remind people,
[02:09:55.590 --> 02:09:57.870]  Uno the movie was like the fourth video I made that day.
[02:09:59.050 --> 02:09:59.790]  Oh, wow. Really?
[02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:00.530]  I'm built for this.
[02:10:00.530 --> 02:10:02.170]  Oh, my God.
[02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:03.370]  You're built different.
[02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:06.590]  I'm glad you're built for this
[02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:08.370]  because you're also the cause
[02:10:08.370 --> 02:10:09.230]  of this.
[02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:12.810]  When you're the cause, you have to be built for it.
[02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:17.570]  Your own worst enemy.
[02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:27.670]  You've got dams with your
[02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:29.030]  random gun firing.
[02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:31.050]  Yeah, Nick really likes it.
[02:10:31.050 --> 02:10:32.590]  I'm shooting the chopper!
[02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:35.030]  I asked Nick to not shoot
[02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:37.170]  one time and he sounded so sad about it
[02:10:37.170 --> 02:10:38.450]  I never brought it up again.
[02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:40.530]  What am I going to do, man?
[02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:41.230]  Just sit here?
[02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:42.670]  It makes it a lot easier.
[02:10:43.530 --> 02:10:45.810]  If it means we beat it, then yeah.
[02:10:46.090 --> 02:10:46.670]  Okay, I'll stop.
[02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:55.130]  Oh, fuck me.
[02:10:59.190 --> 02:11:00.570]  Right about now.
[02:11:00.570 --> 02:11:02.190]  Funk so rubber.
[02:11:03.650 --> 02:11:04.090]  Rubber?
[02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:05.810]  What do you think?
[02:11:06.490 --> 02:11:07.810]  Is that what you think the lyrics are?
[02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:10.550]  That's what I thought until very recently.
[02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:11.870]  The funk is so rubber.
[02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:14.030]  Hey, look, I didn't shoot anybody.
[02:11:19.150 --> 02:11:20.030]  Oh, shit.
[02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:20.650]  Feel free to shoot.
[02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:23.930]  You got it, boss.
[02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:26.170]  It just feels like sometimes their
[02:11:26.170 --> 02:11:28.590]  vehicle swerving is in response to the
[02:11:28.590 --> 02:11:30.090]  shooting, but careful.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.830]  I think it's just them.
[02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:34.350]  Right about now.
[02:11:36.510 --> 02:11:38.270]  You still trying to get into a vehicle, Gavin?
[02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:40.010]  Or is that idea done?
[02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:41.250]  No, I had one.
[02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:43.090]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:45.890]  What were you riding?
[02:11:46.210 --> 02:11:49.030]  Did the car explode in somewhere or did you guys just detonate a C4
[02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:50.890]  when it exploded and you both died?
[02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.970]  For what?
[02:11:52.410 --> 02:11:53.370]  Oh, on that run?
[02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:56.230]  Gavin got lost, we took a jump,
[02:11:56.230 --> 02:11:57.810]  and then we just decided we got no time,
[02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.930]  so we'll just do this parachute.
[02:11:59.350 --> 02:12:02.110]  Yeah, and just stuck in Knob Hole Canyon.
[02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:04.150]  Knob Hole Canyon?
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:05.310]  Yep.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:10.880]  Safest.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:12.280]  Yeah, okay, Lester.
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:20.700]  It would be interesting to know
[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:22.800]  if it kept reducing our money
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:24.840]  at the lowest amount it reduces at.
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.720]  Like what would it be at now?
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:27.500]  Uh-huh.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.220]  Oh, we'd be at zero. There's no way we're not.
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.420]  Head to the canyon.
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:41.940]  Oh shit, hello.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.600]  This car is not as fast
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:45.720]  as the other one.
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:58.860]  Suck shit, you bitch.
[02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:04.910]  I just don't know why
[02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:06.590]  you are the way you are sometimes, Nick,
[02:13:06.590 --> 02:13:08.550]  and I love you, but I just
[02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:09.590]  don't understand.
[02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:16.750]  He's just unloading
[02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:18.150]  with the grenade launcher everywhere.
[02:13:19.050 --> 02:13:20.490]  Yep. Is it doing work though?
[02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.870]  Yeah.
[02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:23.550]  The problem was it
[02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:26.710]  killing us and launching cars into us.
[02:13:27.130 --> 02:13:28.050]  It always did work.
[02:13:28.330 --> 02:13:29.730]  It arguably did too much.
[02:13:30.590 --> 02:13:32.670]  Yeah, that's why it's got to be used
[02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:33.130]  sparingly.
[02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:34.310]  Well,
[02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:36.910]  we have very different definitions
[02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:39.070]  of sparingly. Oh, only shoot
[02:13:39.070 --> 02:13:39.590]  behind.
[02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:43.270]  That's...
[02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:45.770]  When we have to restart
[02:13:45.770 --> 02:13:46.790]  this, I'm really sorry.
[02:13:47.870 --> 02:13:48.930]  Have you fallen again?
[02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:49.910]  Yeah.
[02:13:51.650 --> 02:13:53.190]  I just went a different way and I just
[02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:55.250]  couldn't, like, the house of cards
[02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:56.610]  just fucking fell apart. Yeah.
[02:13:57.230 --> 02:13:58.950]  Yeah, I guess I got something in your system.
[02:13:59.470 --> 02:14:01.170]  I was cooking and then all of a sudden
[02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:03.090]  I hit one tree and then it was like,
[02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:04.710]  alright, never mind. Like the whole
[02:14:05.150 --> 02:14:05.990]  thing was done.
[02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:08.570]  This is genuinely wild.
[02:14:10.190 --> 02:14:11.310]  What is today?
[02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:13.170]  Is it Monday? Yeah, it's Monday.
[02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:17.210]  It is wild because you've given up on the motorbikes.
[02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:19.170]  You've moved to a different type of car that
[02:14:19.170 --> 02:14:21.170]  is not intended. Well, it means I don't
[02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:21.510]  die.
[02:14:22.810 --> 02:14:24.750]  I'm with you. Let's do the car again.
[02:14:25.390 --> 02:14:26.490]  I'm in. I don't care.
[02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:28.910]  After that last time that I died, I'm frustrated.
[02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:31.310]  Alright, let's
[02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:32.530]  split up and find a fast car.
[02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:37.210]  Alright, we'll see you fellas on the other side.
[02:14:41.380 --> 02:14:41.780]  Sorry.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.200]  Oops, sorry.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:45.160]  All good.
[02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:49.060]  Sorry is the hardest word.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:55.260]  That's cops. That's also cops.
[02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:56.840]  Huh.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.860]  The choppers didn't follow us that time.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:00.580]  Does that look any good?
[02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:02.820]  Must be after those guys.
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:04.420]  Oh shit!
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:05.260]  Eric, get in.
[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:07.940]  I got hit by
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:10.220]  a cop. Eric, get in.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:12.760]  I'm trying, I'm trying. Got hit by another car.
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:13.800]  Eric, get in.
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:15.320]  Eric, get in.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:18.520]  I got hit by every car on the road.
[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:23.580]  It's magnetized to you.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.700]  You went by me so fast
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:28.660]  for some reason. I got hit by
[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.680]  a car. The car threw me.
[02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:31.740]  No, you were on a bike.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:34.500]  They hit me. I was on a bike.
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:36.720]  They hit me. That's why I went by
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:38.940]  you so fast. Is that why you overshot
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:40.060]  me by half a kilometer?
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:42.780]  I was stopping and they went, I don't think
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.400]  so, and slammed me.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:48.640]  Sometimes there's no cars there and it's a bit of a
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.820]  bubber. I went left and it just
[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:52.700]  spawned two
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:54.640]  cops. Oh, you never
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.220]  want to go left.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:57.100]  Good to know.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:59.340]  Hey guys, don't let the edit fool
[02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:01.120]  you. This is two hours and twenty
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.120]  four minutes in.
[02:16:10.410 --> 02:16:12.970]  I just can't believe there's no checkpoints
[02:16:12.970 --> 02:16:14.490]  beyond this part.
[02:16:15.250 --> 02:16:16.570]  There's no checkpoints in your eyes.
[02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:20.650]  You said, thank god there is.
[02:16:20.730 --> 02:16:22.690]  What are you talking about? Can you imagine
[02:16:22.690 --> 02:16:24.550]  running from the
[02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:25.830]  bank again?
[02:16:27.670 --> 02:16:28.190]  Where are the
[02:16:28.190 --> 02:16:29.550]  fast cars, son? None.
[02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.550]  Oh, you got one? Okay, I see it, I see it.
[02:16:32.510 --> 02:16:33.250]  I'm coming to you.
[02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:35.490]  Alright, get the god damn in this.
[02:16:35.810 --> 02:16:37.830]  Yeah, please don't drive it. Get in
[02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:39.470]  real now. Super now.
[02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:41.910]  Okay, let's go. Go, go, go.
[02:16:42.810 --> 02:16:43.830]  We got a really fast
[02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:46.010]  car. The problem is, I don't know how much damage
[02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:47.250]  it's going to be able to take, man.
[02:16:51.310 --> 02:16:53.850]  Alright, you guys stay alive because we finally got it right.
[02:16:53.850 --> 02:16:55.990]  Yep. Wait, you're telling
[02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:57.910]  us to not screw up? Yep.
[02:16:58.170 --> 02:16:59.430]  Oh, that guy screwed up himself!
[02:16:59.730 --> 02:17:01.490]  Nice. Whoa.
[02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:05.270]  Oh, shit. Why'd I go first person?
[02:17:05.730 --> 02:17:07.970]  What a mistake. Repeat, you said
[02:17:07.970 --> 02:17:09.430]  to us to not screw up?
[02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:10.630]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:12.090 --> 02:17:13.350]  Right into that guy.
[02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:15.270]  Shoot that guy.
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:21.300]  Oh. Uh-oh.
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:23.560]  One last armor left. Uh-oh.
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:24.740]  What does that mean?
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:27.180]  Uh-oh. What? Uh-oh.
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:29.020]  Just lost a tire. That's fine.
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:30.100]  Sweet.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:32.840]  Downside to cars.
[02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:38.950]  What kind of car
[02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:39.950]  are you riding?
[02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:42.350]  A little Ferrari-looking thing.
[02:17:42.550 --> 02:17:42.930]  Ooh.
[02:17:44.130 --> 02:17:47.070]  I mean, you
[02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:48.270]  can take...
[02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.470]  Oh.
[02:17:50.470 --> 02:17:52.930]  You can take shortcuts because we got strong spines now,
[02:17:53.010 --> 02:17:54.970]  but it's up to you. Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
[02:17:54.970 --> 02:17:56.170]  I don't care. It's up to you.
[02:17:56.250 --> 02:17:57.850]  Oh, that's right into the telephone pole.
[02:17:59.950 --> 02:18:00.310]  Oh!
[02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:03.130]  Shortcut. Immediate telephone.
[02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:06.990]  The missing wheel
[02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:08.870]  is really... it's throwing me a little...
[02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:10.590]  It's making it tough. Yeah.
[02:18:11.070 --> 02:18:12.970]  Yeah, I understand. Yeah, I get it, man.
[02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:17.010]  Gonna want to roll that car
[02:18:17.010 --> 02:18:19.030]  one way or the other. Eat a dick, officer.
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:23.940]  Nice job.
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:25.200]  Okay.
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:28.200]  Oh, balls! You killed us!
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:31.660]  Okay, we're still alive.
[02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:32.060]  We're still alive.
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:34.460]  Shoot him. Run and gun. Run and gun.
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:36.360]  Okay, Nick, get back on. Hard right.
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.080]  I can't until you're up under this.
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:41.100]  Nick! Go around!
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.540]  Go around!
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.640]  What are you
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:46.500]  doing?
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.740]  He's not getting on!
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.020]  Leave me! Leave me!
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:51.920]  Go! No!
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:53.700]  Just get on!
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:56.220]  It won't let me get on!
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:58.600]  He's not getting on!
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:00.600]  Okay, I'm here.
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:02.540]  Let me off. Now try getting off.
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:08.320]  It was stuck in a loop, I swear.
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:09.640]  It would not let me get on.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:11.520]  We were doing great.
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:14.800]  Yeah, I'd say we were doing fine.
[02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:16.600]  It would not let me get on.
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.160]  I was hitting Y.
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:21.240]  We were a little too tall.
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.200]  We went under a sign
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.300]  and we were too tall and it knocked us both off.
[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:27.340]  And then I got back on and it would not let him on.
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:29.300]  It wouldn't let me go
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:31.300]  to the car. It wouldn't let me go anywhere. I would not
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:31.980]  Y.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:34.120]  Do it again.
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:37.480]  Gavin, you want to do it again?
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:38.260]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:41.140]  Where'd you guys get to with the car?
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:42.920]  Where were you? Right by you.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:43.660]  Oh, nice.
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:47.120]  We had a slow stop, but we caught up.
[02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:49.180]  Oh, the tire
[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:49.840]  will do that.
[02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:52.600]  Fat idiot.
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:54.920]  Oh, okay.
[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:56.880]  Oh, sorry. I thought we were doing a separate.
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:06.000]  Hopefully we can get another fast car.
[02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:08.960]  Good luck, Godspeed.
[02:20:15.210 --> 02:20:16.030]  Oh, right here.
[02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.910]  Jump in.
[02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.770]  Sorry, son.
[02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:23.150]  We're in the middle of a heist.
[02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:24.590]  Perfect timing.
[02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:27.330]  Did you get something immediately?
[02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:29.150]  Yeah. Nice.
[02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:31.830]  I'm not sure about the speed of it, but...
[02:20:31.830 --> 02:20:33.170]  I mean, it's just like a sonata.
[02:20:33.430 --> 02:20:34.150]  Like it's not anything.
[02:20:37.170 --> 02:20:42.410]  That was awesome.
[02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:45.630]  God, what are these guys shooting me with?
[02:20:47.650 --> 02:20:48.090]  Gun.
[02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:49.930]  Hey, thanks.
[02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:51.370]  Right about now.
[02:20:51.370 --> 02:20:52.170]  Shut up.
[02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:56.250]  What are you doing, Rock?
[02:20:56.730 --> 02:20:57.170]  The wheel.
[02:20:58.950 --> 02:20:59.470]  Paper.
[02:21:03.070 --> 02:21:03.590]  Scissors.
[02:21:06.730 --> 02:21:08.230]  This car is kind of an ass.
[02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:10.070]  Yeah, we take one of these cop cars.
[02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:13.150]  It's too many.
[02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:14.190]  We'll get a different one.
[02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:16.930]  Nice. Jump in.
[02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:19.150]  It's so scary
[02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:20.890]  in a game when you drive through something
[02:21:20.890 --> 02:21:22.750]  you've never driven through before and you're not sure
[02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:23.810]  if it'll be solid or not.
[02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:26.890]  Games like this are about
[02:21:26.890 --> 02:21:28.110]  learning the street posts.
[02:21:30.730 --> 02:21:32.090]  Street, lamp, and tree.
[02:21:33.730 --> 02:21:36.550]  Yeah, but it's too much shit.
[02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:37.430]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:41.790]  Thanks for the assist.
[02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:43.550]  I'm trying.
[02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.610]  Jump in.
[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:46.870]  Damn.
[02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:49.390]  Shortcut.
[02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:56.670]  There's a couple of boys driving for their boat.
[02:21:57.330 --> 02:21:58.450]  Oh my god.
[02:22:00.130 --> 02:22:00.590]  Please, sir.
[02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:01.850]  We have a boat ahead of us.
[02:22:01.890 --> 02:22:02.630]  It's upside down.
[02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:09.030]  Gas it.
[02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.890]  Go right. Let's go.
[02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:12.170]  Go right?
[02:22:12.610 --> 02:22:13.170]  Yeah, why not?
[02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:15.430]  Take it off-road.
[02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:16.610]  See if we can get away from these guys.
[02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:24.230]  Oh, this missing tire.
[02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:26.850]  Every time with a
[02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:27.370]  missing tire.
[02:22:27.730 --> 02:22:29.390]  Is it the same tire or is it different?
[02:22:29.610 --> 02:22:30.810]  No, this is a back one this time.
[02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:32.130]  Oh man.
[02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:35.190]  It's causing a lot of spinach.
[02:22:36.250 --> 02:22:37.290]  Not the food.
[02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:41.530]  Oh no.
[02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.570]  Uh-oh. Can you roll it?
[02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.590]  Alright, cool.
[02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:49.950]  Where are we getting hit from?
[02:22:50.530 --> 02:22:51.710]  I do not know.
[02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:53.650]  Oh, it was the chopper up there, I think.
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:22:59.280]  Oh, he pinned that guy!
[02:23:06.450 --> 02:23:07.930]  I think we lost the third tire.
[02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:09.170]  Yeah, I think we might.
[02:23:09.290 --> 02:23:11.090]  That seems like it would be a problem.
[02:23:12.490 --> 02:23:13.990]  We might have to make a little switchy.
[02:23:14.550 --> 02:23:15.230]  Yeah, but we gotta
[02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:16.810]  wait and do it right.
[02:23:16.810 --> 02:23:17.410]  Yeah.
[02:23:18.310 --> 02:23:20.210]  Are you thinking that car?
[02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:21.510]  That car dead ahead?
[02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:24.370]  Uh, no.
[02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:25.190]  Okay.
[02:23:26.470 --> 02:23:26.910]  No.
[02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:29.750]  Oh.
[02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:31.550]  Nicely done.
[02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:35.990]  Oh my god.
[02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:38.750]  Keep hope alive.
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:44.960]  Oh, they're so good at
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.180]  wingle-wangling.
[02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:49.260]  My favorite
[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:50.420]  British chocolate bar.
[02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:54.340]  That's real chocolate,
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:54.700]  Andrew.
[02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:57.020]  Oh, tree.
[02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:59.060]  Why was that tree there?
[02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:00.460]  We're upside down, buddy.
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.440]  That's a bad one.
[02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:05.640]  That's a real shame.
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:07.860]  Not sure if we're gonna...
[02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:09.060]  Don't know if we're long for this world.
[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:12.180]  Well, longer than this.
[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:12.980]  Yep.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:16.240]  Oh.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:17.140]  Oh, that was just a hiker.
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:17.560]  Oh.
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:21.000]  When's that ever
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:21.380]  stopped you?
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:24.700]  He did look like a cop.
[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:26.360]  Yeah, he looked like a cop.
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:27.640]  He was moving like a cop.
[02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:29.980]  Oh, now you're dressed like one.
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:30.620]  You wanna try this?
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:32.660]  This is interesting.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.100]  I don't know that we have a choice, man.
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:36.680]  You gotta get in front of him.
[02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.580]  Oh, cops.
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:44.860]  Gavin?
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:46.480]  Gavin!
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.440]  You have to get in.
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:50.240]  Why'd you do that?
[02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:52.160]  Because you're not doing anything.
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.580]  You've wedged. Come forward.
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:24:57.420]  I just got a P, man.
[02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:05.390]  I couldn't pull out my gun because I was stuck in that brick.
[02:25:05.390 --> 02:25:06.890]  You were just stuck.
[02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:08.430]  You were standing there.
[02:25:11.810 --> 02:25:12.410]  Oh,
[02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:13.370]  that was
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.810]  suck.
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:19.520]  Okay,
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:20.820]  we've parachuted.
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:22.080]  Okay.
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:25.620]  Careful.
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:27.880]  This thing is slippery.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:31.180]  Oh.
[02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:32.620]  Yeah, one of those guys went.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:37.020]  Should I get into
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:38.000]  explosives, do you think?
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:38.740]  No.
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:39.380]  Okay.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:42.360]  That was a very quick answer.
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:44.680]  Yeah, I felt the fear in your voice.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:48.480]  Let's fear more reason, I would say.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.480]  Yeah, you know what, that's fair.
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:51.340]  Absolutely. I don't think anything was fearful.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:53.120]  I just don't want to do this again.
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:56.840]  I hope we get enough speed in this thing
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.280]  to get some distance from the cliff.
[02:25:58.380 --> 02:25:59.600]  I don't know that we're going to.
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.600]  Well, we could always steal the one by the bridge.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:04.960]  It's true, but I don't know that it's gonna be better.
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:05.960]  Hey, thanks, man.
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:07.680]  These are not gonna be faster.
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:10.000]  Hey, we're back in the thingy.
[02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:10.440]  Okay.
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:12.700]  Please don't drown. Okay.
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:14.400]  Ah, shit.
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:16.860]  I'm gonna have to just take this.
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:21.280]  We got three and a half minutes.
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:23.900]  Just watch you guys on the mini-map.
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:26.980]  Oh my god, you fat idiot.
[02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:32.140]  Come on!
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:33.440]  Come on, you idiot!
[02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:40.100]  Eric's moving with a good pace.
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:42.020]  Try him.
[02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:45.500]  I lost a tire or two.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:51.360]  Eric, wait up.
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.360]  Why? Wait up? No.
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:56.400]  Because if I can't get up a hill, I'm gonna need to get in.
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:00.180]  I don't think we have the time frame to wait up.
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:02.340]  We don't. It's under three minutes.
[02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:03.080]  Alright.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:06.020]  Thanks, Nick.
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:09.960]  I mean, I didn't have anything to add, except...
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:11.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.920]  Okay, I need to get in.
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:19.040]  What?
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:21.520]  I can't come back for you. I'm too far gone.
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:23.980]  Well, it would have been helpful if you
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:24.840]  stuck around a little.
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:27.820]  You think the problem was me?
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:30.300]  No, it would have been more helpful for my incompetence.
[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:33.900]  What do I do? Do I wait?
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:36.140]  I can't wait. I can't go back.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:41.280]  We have to go back.
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.060]  Shut up, Jack.
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:47.360]  Kate!
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:52.620]  He's just running on foot.
[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:56.540]  I'm excited to see this in the edit.
[02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:00.700]  I'm never watching this video again.
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:02.620]  I mean, yeah, I guess.
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:06.140]  You said that about Full Spectrum Warrior.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:06.800]  You watched it.
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:07.740]  That's true.
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:09.680]  I guess with enough time between them.
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:10.780]  Where?
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:14.520]  No, he's so far.
[02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:16.420]  You guys are so far from each other.
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.920]  I just...
[02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.920]  You got 90 seconds.
[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:24.680]  Alright, if I can find a ledge.
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:26.220]  Oh, a car.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.520]  I was able to parachute.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:30.380]  Oh, that's good.
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:33.420]  I heard the car explode. That's awesome.
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:33.720]  Yup.
[02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:44.820]  Come on!
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:48.320]  Come on, get up there!
[02:28:56.810 --> 02:28:59.390]  Come on, you fat schmuck.
[02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:00.390]  Come on.
[02:29:01.350 --> 02:29:02.530]  Oh, Eric's coming in.
[02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:03.730]  Let me move my camera.
[02:29:04.390 --> 02:29:05.650]  Get a cool angle on this.
[02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:07.390]  Geronimo!
[02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:10.750]  Was that a cool angle?
[02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:11.550]  That was pretty cool.
[02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:16.830]  Where's the dinghy at?
[02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:19.090]  It's the blue thing on the map.
[02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.750]  It's where it always is.
[02:29:20.970 --> 02:29:22.290]  I've never seen it yet.
[02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:25.870]  Gavin might make it.
[02:29:26.290 --> 02:29:28.210]  It's going to become a question of do we get more time.
[02:29:31.290 --> 02:29:32.510]  Where is it? I don't see it.
[02:29:33.810 --> 02:29:34.730]  It's all in the flare.
[02:29:35.530 --> 02:29:36.150]  Oh, I see it.
[02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:37.870]  17.
[02:29:39.550 --> 02:29:40.390]  I'm coming, son.
[02:29:41.790 --> 02:29:43.190]  Oh, come on, Gavin.
[02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:44.610]  Come on!
[02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:45.830]  Come on!
[02:29:47.610 --> 02:29:48.210]  Oh!
[02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:50.930]  Get in the boat!
[02:29:53.810 --> 02:29:54.590]  Hit triangle!
[02:29:54.990 --> 02:29:56.170]  Why? Hit something!
[02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:59.450]  You didn't do it.
[02:29:59.570 --> 02:30:00.550]  You didn't hit the button.
[02:30:01.350 --> 02:30:02.650]  I did, I'm sat down.
[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:14.980]  Maybe because we're all at the dinghy.
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:16.580]  You're dumb as fuck.
[02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:21.540]  What?
[02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:27.460]  You know what they say?
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:29.900]  When two ends of tape get too far apart from each other,
[02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:32.040]  they lose their...
[02:30:32.040 --> 02:30:33.960]  Why didn't you just get in the car I was in?
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.580]  You got in the other car.
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:37.660]  What other car?
[02:30:39.340 --> 02:30:40.180]  Oh, at the bridge?
[02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:42.760]  Yeah, remember when we got in different cars?
[02:30:43.180 --> 02:30:44.740]  Yeah, I got tangled up in the buttons.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:46.500]  Oh, yeah?
[02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:47.260]  Did you hit triangle?
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:53.420]  One second left
[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:54.900]  for someone to scream at me to hit triangle.
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:56.640]  Jesus Christ.
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:02.560]  Well, that's new.
[02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:06.740]  Well, that's the furthest
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:08.400]  we've all gotten as a group.
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.080]  Hey, you know what?
[02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:11.640]  Progress.
[02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:13.120]  It is progress.
[02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:15.820]  Disagree.
[02:31:16.380 --> 02:31:16.740]  Whoa!
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:18.700]  That was crazy.
[02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:20.960]  Oh, that's just a minivan.
[02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:21.380]  Whoops.
[02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:25.340]  Hi, they're back.
[02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:27.440]  Okay.
[02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:29.680]  I thought they were going to plow through that.
[02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:30.300]  Yeah.
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:32.580]  Would have been helpful, honestly.
[02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:34.560]  I wouldn't have minded.
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:39.900]  Oh, my God!
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:41.480]  When we have to do this again,
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:42.020]  I'm really sorry.
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:43.240]  No!
[02:31:47.500 --> 02:31:49.320]  I had an infernus again.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.500]  At least we know
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.220]  you can jump from the cars off the cliff.
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:53.980]  Yeah!
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:56.500]  You just have to be fast about it.
[02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:58.160]  You just have to hit the buttons really fast.
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:01.480]  And you can haul ass to the dinghy by parachute.
[02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:03.040]  Gavin was
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:04.280]  hauling ass.
[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:06.660]  Gavin, that was incredible.
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.440]  Pro move.
[02:32:12.220 --> 02:32:13.080]  This is the one.
[02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:13.940]  This is it.
[02:32:13.960 --> 02:32:14.380]  Ready?
[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:17.120]  Let's do it.
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:20.360]  Let's get a car.
[02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:30.600]  Still want to play GTA, Eric?
[02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:34.320]  Yeah, something that's not this, absolutely.
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:36.580]  Two hours and 40 minutes.
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:38.380]  Insane.
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:40.340]  This actually might be our longest video now.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:42.640]  Yeah, when you ask that
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:43.540]  at two hours, no.
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:45.480]  Come here.
[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:47.140]  Eric, shoot this guy.
[02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:48.600]  Shoot this car guy.
[02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:50.700]  Shoot the guy in his car.
[02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:55.560]  I'm going to knock his wheel out.
[02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:56.880]  Why'd you do that?
[02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:57.860]  What?
[02:32:58.640 --> 02:32:59.680]  You shot his wheel out?
[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:02.240]  No, I said I'm going to shoot his wheel out.
[02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:04.000]  Like if you had me keep firing at him.
[02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:06.260]  It was just going to do more damage to the car.
[02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:09.360]  What the fuck?
[02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:19.100]  Oh, that guy.
[02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:20.280]  What happened here?
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:21.540]  That was weird, yeah.
[02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:24.100]  Looked like a whole other team
[02:33:24.100 --> 02:33:25.720]  had come through and wiped out that...
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:28.780]  That team of cops.
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:29.760]  Holy...
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:30.080]  Ah!
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:34.980]  Oh, what the...
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:35.600]  Where'd you come from?
[02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:40.660]  Oh, shit.
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:42.060]  This thing?
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:45.240]  It was, but...
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:45.660]  Too quick.
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:47.600]  Oh!
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:54.700]  Yeah, we're still alive.
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:56.720]  Getting in the bike.
[02:33:58.800 --> 02:34:00.140]  Okay, Nick, you're just going to do that?
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:00.460]  Okay.
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:02.260]  Fair enough.
[02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:05.720]  I'm losing armor like a chump.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.080]  There's someone right behind us.
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:10.600]  Oh, God.
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:10.740]  Oh, God.
[02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.920]  I see what you mean about the speed
[02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:16.140]  when you're in a bike by yourself, Eric.
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:16.900]  This is crazy.
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:19.860]  Way different, right?
[02:34:24.810 --> 02:34:25.430]  Oh, my God.
[02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:26.030]  Oh, my God.
[02:34:29.210 --> 02:34:29.890]  Holy shit!
[02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:30.950]  Whoa! Ow.
[02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:33.090]  Come on, man.
[02:34:33.090 --> 02:34:34.050]  We're cooking right here. We're cooking.
[02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:35.170]  Yep.
[02:34:36.570 --> 02:34:38.210]  Just keep armoring up until you can't,
[02:34:38.210 --> 02:34:38.810]  and then use your health.
[02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:40.130]  Or, like, snacks.
[02:34:40.470 --> 02:34:41.130]  As much as you can.
[02:34:49.770 --> 02:34:50.390]  Oh, Jesus.
[02:34:51.890 --> 02:34:52.190]  Got him.
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:34:59.480]  That was awesome.
[02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:05.910]  Had to revise.
[02:35:07.050 --> 02:35:07.470]  Improvise.
[02:35:08.130 --> 02:35:08.670]  Doing fine.
[02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:11.870]  Jesus Christ. I'm fine.
[02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:14.610]  Is it just bulletproof wheels
[02:35:14.610 --> 02:35:15.650]  on this thing that's getting us there?
[02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:16.470]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:35:17.470 --> 02:35:18.950]  Oh, which thing are you driving right now?
[02:35:20.370 --> 02:35:21.130]  The motorcycle.
[02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:22.350]  Oh, okay.
[02:35:24.250 --> 02:35:25.370]  The only downside
[02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:26.250]  to getting in the car is that
[02:35:27.350 --> 02:35:28.650]  the wheels are up for grabs.
[02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:29.390]  Yep.
[02:35:31.330 --> 02:35:32.510]  And fences and shit.
[02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:38.270]  I didn't see that rock.
[02:35:38.770 --> 02:35:39.870]  Oh, boy. That was bad.
[02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:42.430]  We stole the sign for a little bit there.
[02:35:45.610 --> 02:35:47.190]  So is Nick the only one in the car
[02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.830]  at this point?
[02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:49.010]  I think so.
[02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:51.030]  What car did you get?
[02:35:51.790 --> 02:35:52.830]  A cop SUV.
[02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:55.190]  Thank you.
[02:35:58.910 --> 02:36:00.130]  I'm getting through, am I?
[02:36:00.470 --> 02:36:01.110]  Holy shit.
[02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:18.720]  Didn't intend to go this way, but that's fine.
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:20.460]  It'll work.
[02:36:30.210 --> 02:36:31.810]  No, no, no, no, no!
[02:36:32.530 --> 02:36:33.570]  Aw, shit.
[02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:38.580]  How did Gavin die?
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:40.520]  Got shot.
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:43.000]  We careened off the bike.
[02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:45.920]  Whee!
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:51.400]  Uh-oh.
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:53.240]  You okay?
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:54.820]  Eric deafened himself.
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:02.340]  They really do shoot out the tires
[02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:04.080]  on any car. It's insane.
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:04.720]  Oh, they do?
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:06.340]  Oh, dude, it was.
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:09.980]  I was completely out of their reach
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.820]  and suddenly the wheels just went...
[02:37:14.660 --> 02:37:15.980]  Gavin, you want to get a car, or what do you want to do?
[02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:17.540]  I think we should try and get one
[02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:18.360]  that's not just down the bike.
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:22.700]  That was a weird one.
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.920]  Oh, there's one. Red one.
[02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:29.620]  Here?
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:32.220]  What happened?
[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:34.420]  Oh, I guess this one works.
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.200]  Oh, oh, it's over here, it's over here, it's over here.
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.340]  I'm sorry, I didn't see this.
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:42.940]  Are you not? Oh, okay.
[02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:44.320]  I guess it's just me then. Okay.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.220]  You want to get one each? One each.
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:49.220]  One each. Let's do it.
[02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:54.280]  Good shots.
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:55.780]  Uh, thank you.
[02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:58.420]  This is not good.
[02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:02.660]  Wow.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.120]  Well, that guy timed that very poorly, didn't he?
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:07.580]  He was way too early.
[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:12.720]  He went up for a rebound way too soon.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:21.300]  Oh, that thing happened again.
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:24.820]  Oh, you shot that guy off.
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.120]  I did.
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:28.040]  Oh, alright.
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:31.060]  He drove into that pole all by himself.
[02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:33.620]  Later.
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.000]  Oh, I just hit some random-ass fucking car.
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:43.060]  Oh, it's a hiker.
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:47.620]  Okay, no cops, no cops.
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:49.480]  Oh, I'm just gonna fucking die.
[02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:51.140]  Okay, I'm okay.
[02:38:55.100 --> 02:39:01.360]  Great, great, great.
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:06.920]  Man, I'm holding ass.
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:10.340]  Oh, what are you, smart bastard?
[02:39:11.260 --> 02:39:12.440]  Clever girl, son of a bitch?
[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:16.800]  Clever girl, son of a bitch.
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:22.300]  If Muldoon had lived long enough, that's what he was gonna say.
[02:39:29.010 --> 02:39:29.710]  Got the driver.
[02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:30.710]  Nice.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:35.820]  Yeah!
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:39.780]  Oh, did I lose a wheel?
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:44.000]  Man, I'll tell you what.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:47.260]  When you hit that ramp, it really helps get them off your ass.
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:49.240]  What hit me?
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.020]  What the fuck?
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:51.760]  Holy shit.
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:53.920]  I don't want to shit show off, man.
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:57.940]  Dog, you opened my office door.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:58.440]  What are you doing?
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:00.740]  Which one?
[02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:02.720]  The peopleized dog.
[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:03.640]  Nice.
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:06.880]  I assume he came in to be like,
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:08.260]  you've been in here for ages, father.
[02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:11.140]  Fuck.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:11.940]  Father, please.
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:14.220]  Dude, they shot out one of my tires,
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:16.240]  and if I break, ooh, it's bad.
[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:17.400]  Yeah.
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:20.640]  Yeah, we're kind of...
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:23.980]  Yeah, we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:27.960]  Oh, shit.
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:29.580]  Did you die?
[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:30.520]  Yeah, I got shot.
[02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:32.820]  Oh, no!
[02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:42.590]  What vehicles did you guys get?
[02:40:43.430 --> 02:40:43.830]  Infernus.
[02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:45.830]  Oh, Banshee.
[02:40:48.610 --> 02:40:49.970]  Gavin, I think we go to the same way,
[02:40:50.010 --> 02:40:51.450]  see if that Infernus is over there, and we go.
[02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:54.050]  That seemed like a good spot for those cars.
[02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:56.190]  Seemed like a luxury area.
[02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.710]  Yeah.
[02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:59.170]  Are you finding them parked, or taking them?
[02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:01.350]  Well, both.
[02:41:01.350 --> 02:41:03.290]  That time, they were parked.
[02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:05.090]  Sorry.
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:12.760]  No problem.
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:14.260]  Up we go, Ratman.
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:17.360]  Anything over here?
[02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:19.280]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:20.160]  Where?
[02:41:20.820 --> 02:41:23.220]  I didn't see anything.
[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:24.780]  The white one, turn around.
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:25.720]  I'm trying.
[02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:27.040]  Left or right?
[02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:30.780]  I didn't even see that.
[02:41:34.830 --> 02:41:35.390]  Whoa.
[02:41:35.390 --> 02:41:35.930]  Whoa.
[02:41:37.150 --> 02:41:38.690]  That made quite the thunk.
[02:41:40.730 --> 02:41:41.570]  Oh, goodbye.
[02:41:49.210 --> 02:41:49.770]  Woohoo!
[02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:52.790]  What a move, Gavin!
[02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:56.970]  They can't shoot our tires if they're pointed up.
[02:41:58.310 --> 02:41:59.290]  Something like that.
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.220]  Oh, you little son of a bitch.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:12.760]  Oh!
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:14.720]  Piece of fucking garbage.
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:18.360]  Fuck!
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:19.240]  Yeah.
[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:20.640]  Oh my god.
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:25.020]  What are we going to do?
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:26.060]  What are we going to do?
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:27.900]  We're going to get it. It's fine.
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:28.780]  We're going to win!
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:32.080]  All the pieces will come together eventually.
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:32.980]  Yeah!
[02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:34.220]  We got it.
[02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:37.460]  We could not get past this cop car in front of us.
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:40.300]  No, he weaved in and out, knocked us over,
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:43.020]  and then the cavalry
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:44.640]  showed up and blew us to pieces.
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:47.060]  It sounds like at least you guys are
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:48.660]  consistently finding a vehicle you like.
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:49.520]  Yeah!
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:51.280]  Once we're in it, it's good.
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:53.480]  How long was this scheduled to?
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:55.860]  This recording block today? Until 5?
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:58.240]  Alright guys, let's do it. We got the money.
[02:42:58.980 --> 02:43:00.200]  Let's finish this thing up.
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:03.020]  I'm excited to...
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:04.700]  Oh, nope.
[02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:06.000]  Not doing that.
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:08.900]  Excited to get to the doomsday heist.
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:11.740]  Yeah, that'll be fun.
[02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:16.520]  My favorite heist is the casino one.
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:17.960]  I'm really excited for when we get to that.
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:19.080]  I don't think I've ever done it.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:20.040]  I don't think I've done that.
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.420]  Yeah, you haven't done that one, Gavin.
[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:21.960]  Sweet.
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:23.740]  How does it compare to this in difficulty?
[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:27.140]  I don't...
[02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:27.960]  I've never had this...
[02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:29.220]  Yeah, could you foresee what was happening here?
[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:38.110]  Ooh!
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:43.820]  The fuck?
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:44.820]  Did you see that garnish?
[02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:45.740]  Yeah.
[02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:47.820]  Must've been going at you at miles an hour.
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:52.600]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:54.040]  That cop was like,
[02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:56.640]  I am going over you. I do not care.
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.260]  No matter what,
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:43:59.220]  he was getting through that.
[02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:02.260]  Well...
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:03.580]  Speaking of which...
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:07.760]  I was like, I had no choice.
[02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:08.680]  You know what?
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:11.100]  We're okay.
[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:13.100]  Totally fine.
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:14.200]  Oh, shit!
[02:44:19.410 --> 02:44:20.530]  Jesus Christ!
[02:44:21.630 --> 02:44:22.370]  I'm dead.
[02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:35.210]  Now there's just silence.
[02:44:37.530 --> 02:44:39.910]  Does Eric keep deafening to curse us out
[02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:41.130]  and then bring himself back in?
[02:44:43.010 --> 02:44:45.310]  He's giving notes to the editor right now
[02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:46.830]  that we can't hear.
[02:44:49.930 --> 02:44:50.370]  Oh...
[02:44:50.370 --> 02:44:51.230]  Eric, why do you keep deafening?
[02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:52.470]  I need a minute.
[02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:55.610]  You want to take a break?
[02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.450]  Nope.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:06.260]  The in-between noise
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:07.300]  after we lose is like,
[02:45:07.340 --> 02:45:09.620]  I just need it to be so dead silent
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:10.880]  I might as well just deafen.
[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:12.460]  It was silent.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:15.260]  You guys are good. Do whatever you want.
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:16.920]  Ooh, fuck, yes. Here we go.
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:18.820]  What the fuck was... What'd you do?
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:20.120]  Action roll.
[02:45:24.740 --> 02:45:25.960]  Did our wheel just pop?
[02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:28.180]  Where? No.
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:29.360]  Did our front tire just go...
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:32.240]  Bringing more heat than they have...
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:34.520]  Nice dodge.
[02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:35.580]  Holy God.
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:38.840]  Well, armor's gone again
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:39.320]  in an instant.
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:42.360]  You might be onto something.
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, follow it.
[02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:47.580]  Follow it. This is different.
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:49.980]  That chopper should be dead.
[02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:54.120]  I can't believe it recovered from that stall.
[02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:00.180]  They did get our tires.
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:01.400]  Yeah, one of your tires is out, yeah.
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:03.720]  They just shot it as we were breaking into it.
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:06.660]  Son of a bitch.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:08.620]  Just gonna make this tough.
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.820]  Gonna be boo-boo big time tough.
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:17.660]  Boo-boo big time tough?
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:18.300]  Oh my God.
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:18.420]  Boo-boo big time tough.
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:21.180]  Hey, boo-boo big time.
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:24.140]  Eric, put armor on!
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:25.580]  Yeah, no, I got it.
[02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:26.800]  We were stuck.
[02:46:27.280 --> 02:46:29.060]  Yeah, that's when you just mash armor.
[02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:37.080]  Maybe it's impossible.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:39.560]  I think we should get a car and head west.
[02:46:40.420 --> 02:46:40.840]  Okay.
[02:46:41.980 --> 02:46:43.880]  Like, just go west as far as we can
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:45.820]  until we hit that Pacific Coast Highway
[02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:46.300]  and go north.
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:49.040]  But then we got cut up
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:49.760]  Chilead backwards?
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.960]  Or have we been coming up Chilead from that way?
[02:47:02.580 --> 02:47:05.300]  It didn't even sound like what you said was worth it.
[02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:07.340]  I don't know what you said.
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:10.960]  Chilead backwards.
[02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:13.660]  Wonk it Chilead backwards?
[02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:14.600]  What did you say?
[02:47:14.980 --> 02:47:16.640]  Wonk it Chilead backwards followed by
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:18.500]  silent, silent, silent, silent.
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:19.260]  What?
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:21.880]  I just don't know what you said.
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.760]  God, it's not here.
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:28.100]  I'm just gonna go west and see what happens.
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:29.220]  That was fucking funny.
[02:47:29.500 --> 02:47:31.580]  Go west. I was speaking English.
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:33.460]  I just didn't understand.
[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:34.260]  English.
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:35.980]  Where the air is free.
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:39.200]  Right? Isn't that that ad?
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:42.040]  Uh, oh, you're talking about
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:42.400]  Who are?
[02:47:42.580 --> 02:47:42.740]  Yeah.
[02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:46.940]  I mean, it's also Pet Shop Boys
[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:49.700]  slash Village People.
[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:50.860]  Oh, yeah.
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:53.660]  I was
[02:47:53.660 --> 02:47:55.700]  watching an American feed
[02:47:55.700 --> 02:47:57.900]  so I was seeing American commercials which I don't typically
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:47:59.060]  get, obviously.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:01.540]  You guys just have commercials for Jesus?
[02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:03.320]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:04.280]  He gets us.
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:07.680]  That's like a thing that started at like the
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:08.820]  Super Bowl last year.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:11.580]  And everyone
[02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:13.380]  just, every time they come on, someone goes
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:15.880]  like, it's just so
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:17.160]  they suck.
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:18.940]  Yeah, they're like
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:20.280]  the political ads.
[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:21.380]  Yeah.
[02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:23.440]  For Jesus?
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:24.820]  Yeah.
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:28.400]  Straight up has ads for a drug.
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:29.400]  Yeah.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.940]  Ask your doctor to give you this drug.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.160]  This drug might give you diarrhea.
[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:36.740]  Or death.
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:39.160]  Oh, I got
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:39.880]  plenty of death.
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:43.120]  Oh, you idiot.
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:44.760]  See?
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:46.180]  Sounds promising.
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:52.360]  What the
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:53.680]  fuck is shooting us?
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.140]  There's a guy. There's just one guy in the hills.
[02:48:56.740 --> 02:48:57.760]  If you get one guy
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:48:59.900]  stuck behind you, it's the worst.
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:06.000]  War!
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:07.800]  Bear the ears!
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:10.120]  War!
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:11.820]  I don't know.
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:13.800]  I guess, did you edit it?
[02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:14.880]  I did, yeah.
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:18.780]  At least a year and a half. Almost two years old now.
[02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:19.640]  Yeah.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:22.060]  That was our second draft?
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:23.340]  I don't remember, that was early.
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:30.940]  War!
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:34.800]  What was it even for? I don't even remember.
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:37.000]  Ambrosia Custard.
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:42.020]  It's a catchy ad.
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.180]  Well, when we redo this, I'm sorry.
[02:49:48.440 --> 02:49:48.880]  Oh!
[02:49:58.310 --> 02:49:59.110]  We on a bike?
[02:50:01.090 --> 02:50:01.570]  What's that?
[02:50:02.610 --> 02:50:03.110]  We on a bike?
[02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:05.030]  Oh yeah, I was on a bike.
[02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:06.250]  Bikes are rough.
[02:50:06.750 --> 02:50:08.570]  I was trying to find a car.
[02:50:09.390 --> 02:50:10.190]  Couldn't find a car.
[02:50:10.590 --> 02:50:13.130]  I just took off west, because I wanted to try
[02:50:13.130 --> 02:50:14.510]  to get to...
[02:50:15.290 --> 02:50:15.930]  Go west!
[02:50:16.750 --> 02:50:18.250]  I wanted to try to get to that
[02:50:18.990 --> 02:50:20.810]  coast highway and see if it would take me, but
[02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:22.750]  I went up in the mountains, I shouldn't have gone that way.
[02:50:24.010 --> 02:50:24.870]  We're now at three hours.
[02:50:27.430 --> 02:50:28.910]  The bank was like
[02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:30.370]  two and a half hours ago.
[02:50:32.830 --> 02:50:34.670]  Oh my god, get on something!
[02:50:42.410 --> 02:50:43.810]  Am I giving myself a hernia
[02:50:43.810 --> 02:50:44.550]  sitting this way?
[02:50:45.450 --> 02:50:46.470]  Have you pissed yet?
[02:50:46.950 --> 02:50:49.570]  Yeah, I went for a minute.
[02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:53.490]  What the fuck does that mean?
[02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:56.670]  I went, I took a little off the top
[02:50:56.670 --> 02:50:57.250]  and I came back.
[02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:59.530]  What the fuck?
[02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:01.270]  You pinched off a piss?
[02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:02.910]  Yeah, it hurt.
[02:51:03.850 --> 02:51:04.530]  But it had to be done.
[02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:11.470]  Well, now that you've pointed it out, yeah, it's uncomfortable.
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:17.260]  I was sailing towards the dinghy for quite a while.
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:18.300]  You could have done a full blad.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.280]  Yeah, but I didn't want to be the reason
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.120]  that we failed, in case you made it.
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:25.700]  As a passenger in the dinghy?
[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:27.280]  Yeah, but I mean, you could have been like,
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:28.980]  Oh, now get out of the dinghy, do this!
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:29.620]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:35.080]  And I can't imagine you having
[02:51:35.080 --> 02:51:36.700]  parachuted in all that time
[02:51:36.700 --> 02:51:38.600]  just for us to fail because of a piss.
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:42.500]  I was kind of hoping that
[02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:44.700]  you would just finish, essentially, if we got in the dinghy
[02:51:44.700 --> 02:51:46.460]  and you came back shocked that it was over.
[02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:48.960]  I mean, I was hoping for that too,
[02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:51.280]  to be honest with you, but...
[02:51:54.140 --> 02:51:54.500]  Alas.
[02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:56.960]  Oh no, I'm completely pinned!
[02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:58.600]  No, I'm fired again!
[02:52:04.350 --> 02:52:04.990]  I'm overstayed!
[02:52:06.410 --> 02:52:07.110]  Help me!
[02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:08.810]  Help me!
[02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:14.370]  The police did a good job, they should be proud of themselves.
[02:52:17.570 --> 02:52:20.530]  So when I head out west, there's not a lot of
[02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:22.290]  cops when I get over to like that
[02:52:22.290 --> 02:52:22.970]  main highway.
[02:52:23.590 --> 02:52:26.210]  But I worry that because we're not hitting
[02:52:26.210 --> 02:52:28.250]  the yellow checkpoints, that it won't
[02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:29.770]  count. I just don't know.
[02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:31.550]  He did...
[02:52:32.370 --> 02:52:33.850]  Lester said you can go whatever way
[02:52:33.850 --> 02:52:34.230]  you want.
[02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:37.830]  Yeah, I just don't know that we're gonna like, reason
[02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:38.810]  with the video game.
[02:52:40.150 --> 02:52:46.010]  Well, that's the first time my car plan
[02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:46.390]  failed.
[02:52:47.810 --> 02:52:49.350]  Is it? It is.
[02:52:50.290 --> 02:52:51.530]  But in that I died
[02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:52.370]  in the car.
[02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:57.950]  I'm in such, as soon as we
[02:52:57.950 --> 02:52:59.910]  failed delete previous run
[02:52:59.910 --> 02:53:02.110]  mode, that I genuinely couldn't remember if
[02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:04.130]  you'd failed in the car.
[02:53:06.290 --> 02:53:07.690]  Outside of the time running out.
[02:53:07.770 --> 02:53:09.190]  Knowing you, you actually delete it.
[02:53:11.790 --> 02:53:13.310]  Oh, I should move it to my second brain?
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:23.080]  Who's shooting?
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:29.240]  Did you shoot again? Me? No.
[02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:34.400]  I don't think so.
[02:53:35.020 --> 02:53:36.700]  It's just much harder to get in the car
[02:53:36.700 --> 02:53:37.940]  when they're all freaking out.
[02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:40.560]  The cops are coming up
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:42.200]  a different alley than they usually do.
[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:43.560]  That was insane.
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:46.560]  We're fine. We didn't hit anything, but just
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:48.060]  stressing. It's close.
[02:53:50.280 --> 02:53:50.680]  Okay.
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:56.380]  Is the Harball Bowl tonight or is that last night?
[02:53:57.440 --> 02:53:58.300]  See, that was in English.
[02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:00.700]  I got it.
[02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:03.100]  Is it the Harball Bowl?
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:04.500]  The Harball Bowl.
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:06.300]  God, now I am saying it like that.
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:07.560]  Harball Bowl.
[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:09.940]  The Harball
[02:54:11.080 --> 02:54:11.560]  Bowl.
[02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:14.860]  The what?
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:18.620]  There are two coaches in the NFL
[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:20.560]  who are playing each other at some point.
[02:54:21.360 --> 02:54:22.640]  I don't remember if it's
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:24.960]  today or for Thanksgiving.
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:28.800]  I feel like you missed the most key detail.
[02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:30.880]  What?
[02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:31.940]  They're brothers.
[02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:33.380]  Oh yeah, they're brothers.
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:36.880]  But I mean...
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:38.880]  Oh yeah. Hang on, what's the rest
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:39.580]  of the sentence? Go ahead.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.700]  I was saying, did I include the bit
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:44.640]  about how they both have the same name?
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:45.840]  Could be father, son.
[02:54:46.600 --> 02:54:48.760]  Yeah, that's true. Could have been
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:49.540]  the Kiffins.
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:52.780]  Did you get that, Gavin?
[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:53.960]  They could have been the Kiffins.
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.300]  If you said that it was almost like the Kiffins,
[02:54:56.300 --> 02:54:58.340]  I'll be...
[02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:00.160]  Is the other Kiffin dead?
[02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:00.800]  Monty?
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:04.100]  I don't know, Gavin. Is he?
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:06.600]  Monty Kiffin?
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:07.860]  Monty Kiffin!
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:13.580]  Yeah, Kiffin Monty.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.600]  Damn it. Oh my god.
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:17.280]  I don't know what to do anymore.
[02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:30.800]  I wonder how Geoff's time off is going.
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:33.100]  I was thinking
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:33.980]  about that a minute ago.
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:37.240]  Sitting in a restaurant
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:38.380]  thinking about hot dogs.
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:39.860]  Give him a call.
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:43.060]  Last time
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.780]  he did that, he sent him straight to voicemail.
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:45.460]  He did.
[02:55:51.370 --> 02:55:52.070]  Hot dogs
[02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.710]  sound kind of good.
[02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:55.870]  Always sound kind of good.
[02:55:57.170 --> 02:55:57.330]  No.
[02:55:58.210 --> 02:55:58.650]  I disagree.
[02:55:59.610 --> 02:56:00.110]  Let's get a car.
[02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:03.190]  I think there's always room for a hot dog.
[02:56:03.190 --> 02:56:03.810]  I don't know.
[02:56:10.570 --> 02:56:11.410]  Anything over here?
[02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:20.380]  Alright, what way do you want me to go?
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:22.800]  You're good. No, no. Just keep doing what you're doing.
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:23.980]  We're going to get it this time.
[02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:26.780]  Please don't hit that jump.
[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:27.800]  Okay.
[02:56:28.740 --> 02:56:29.320]  You hit the jump.
[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:34.320]  It just does so much damage to the car.
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:36.100]  Close back.
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:41.860]  The flesh wound.
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:47.120]  Ah yes, cosmetic. Just the flesh wound of cars.
[02:56:57.990 --> 02:56:59.690]  Alright, now we're booking Cornhole.
[02:57:02.550 --> 02:57:05.410]  If you're watching this, thank you so much for sticking with it.
[02:57:06.210 --> 02:57:07.670]  I really appreciate you.
[02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.970]  You're a true diehard.
[02:57:09.430 --> 02:57:10.110]  You are
[02:57:11.410 --> 02:57:12.590]  stronger than I am.
[02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:14.270]  I am proud of you.
[02:57:14.990 --> 02:57:16.390]  You're doing a great job.
[02:57:16.390 --> 02:57:17.730]  Thank you very much.
[02:57:19.470 --> 02:57:20.430]  Leave a comment
[02:57:20.430 --> 02:57:21.650]  and let us know
[02:57:21.650 --> 02:57:23.270]  that you made it this far.
[02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:25.410]  Use the...
[02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:28.270]  We'll know
[02:57:28.270 --> 02:57:29.670]  because in the comment you'll say
[02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:31.350]  LameKippinLives
[02:57:31.350 --> 02:57:34.450]  and that's how we'll know that you made it this far in the video.
[02:57:36.930 --> 02:57:38.010]  Well, they just lost.
[02:57:40.490 --> 02:57:42.730]  Still don't know if the fucking Harbaws are playing.
[02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:45.110]  Harbaba?
[02:57:45.770 --> 02:57:46.130]  Harbaba.
[02:57:46.610 --> 02:57:47.530]  Harbaba my superstar.
[02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:51.030]  Don't you know that you're Harbaba
[02:57:51.030 --> 02:57:51.350]  our superstar?
[02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:01.930]  Insane.
[02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:03.090]  Did he kill you?
[02:58:03.550 --> 02:58:04.050]  No, no, no.
[02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.830]  Nobody died.
[02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:09.510]  He really wants to kill us though.
[02:58:10.350 --> 02:58:11.110]  Oh, right behind us.
[02:58:14.410 --> 02:58:15.630]  Ah shit, got him.
[02:58:15.810 --> 02:58:16.270]  There we go.
[02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:24.980]  Okay.
[02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:26.100]  Fine.
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:28.300]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:29.740]  That was not a...
[02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:31.800]  It was more of like a...
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:33.200]  That was more an affirmation to make.
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:34.240]  Got it.
[02:58:35.540 --> 02:58:36.800]  I was affirming you too.
[02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:41.200]  Almost out of this.
[02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:52.960]  Nice movement.
[02:58:54.900 --> 02:58:56.860]  Yeah, I like being able to just go up on the hill.
[02:58:57.300 --> 02:58:58.420]  Hell yeah, we'll take the high road.
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:58:59.960]  Dumbasses.
[02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:02.200]  Nice little speed boost going down.
[02:59:02.820 --> 02:59:04.780]  Oh, Gavin. Oh, Gavin. Oh, Gavin.
[02:59:05.180 --> 02:59:05.800]  Did we lose a wheel?
[02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:06.580]  I don't know.
[02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:10.420]  I swear, every time we cross that bridge...
[02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:11.380]  Okay.
[02:59:12.260 --> 02:59:13.600]  It's okay, we're alright. We're okay.
[02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:15.920]  Nope, we're dead instantly.
[02:59:16.200 --> 02:59:17.100]  I was shot on the ground.
[02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:22.560]  That is infuriating.
[02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:36.710]  Alright, Gavin, let's do it again.
[02:59:39.290 --> 02:59:40.450]  I think we got...
[02:59:40.930 --> 02:59:42.250]  I think we got this here.
[02:59:45.090 --> 02:59:47.290]  And if you're the editor, shout out to you for...
[02:59:47.850 --> 02:59:48.710]  being miserable all day.
[02:59:50.070 --> 02:59:51.390]  Yeah, congratulations on the
[02:59:51.390 --> 02:59:52.370]  payday you get for this.
[02:59:58.880 --> 02:59:59.600]  What's the...
[02:59:59.600 --> 03:00:01.120]  tactic y'all are running with? Just the car still
[03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:02.640]  together? Yeah.
[03:00:03.020 --> 03:00:04.840]  Oh, oh, oh. This one up here.
[03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:06.960]  It's got the... It's the banshee.
[03:00:07.060 --> 03:00:09.020]  It's got a roof. Oh, roofed banshee.
[03:00:09.020 --> 03:00:11.200]  Yeah. There's also an infernus right there.
[03:00:11.720 --> 03:00:12.080]  Oh.
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:14.660]  Um, let's start this.
[03:00:21.820 --> 03:00:22.920]  Alright, got my stuff.
[03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:25.900]  Alright, I'm rockin' and rollin', let's go.
[03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:27.880]  Ah, shit. Couldn't hit
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:29.540]  that jump, sad. No, you got in the way.
[03:00:32.660 --> 03:00:34.040]  You didn't sound that sad about it.
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:34.860]  What a flesh wound.
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:37.200]  Cosmetic!
[03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:42.860]  Oh shit, watch it.
[03:00:44.040 --> 03:00:44.600]  Watchin' it.
[03:00:45.120 --> 03:00:45.980]  You're good, you're good.
[03:00:52.830 --> 03:00:53.650]  Sometimes I can't tell
[03:00:53.650 --> 03:00:55.130]  whether I've got full armor or no armor.
[03:00:55.990 --> 03:00:57.270]  Yeah. Nice. Should
[03:00:57.270 --> 03:00:59.710]  be darker blue or lighter. Like, they need to be
[03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:01.630]  more different. Yeah.
[03:01:07.940 --> 03:01:08.820]  The choppers!
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:12.560]  Nope.
[03:01:19.980 --> 03:01:20.640]  Oh, good move.
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:21.800]  Good move, good move.
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:22.300]  Oh.
[03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:23.040]  Oh.
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:26.360]  Oh, they're right on our ass.
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:28.680]  Yeah, they are.
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:29.080]  What the?
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:32.260]  Come on, come on.
[03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:33.920]  There we go, we got him.
[03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:34.620]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:36.900]  Got him.
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:39.640]  Holy!
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:42.300]  You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.
[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:45.780]  Got him.
[03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:46.940]  Nice.
[03:01:48.020 --> 03:01:49.520]  I took a bullet there.
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:51.140]  That's a wheel down?
[03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:51.740]  Yep.
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:59.140]  Thankfully, we got three spares.
[03:02:00.220 --> 03:02:00.940]  Yeah, that's what
[03:02:00.940 --> 03:02:01.560]  they're spares.
[03:02:12.810 --> 03:02:13.930]  Oh boy!
[03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:15.270]  Nice squeeze.
[03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:16.130]  Thank you.
[03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:24.820]  You're good.
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:26.540]  That's a good move. Way to go, Gavin.
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:32.540]  Oh god, what happened there?
[03:02:32.540 --> 03:02:34.340]  You just ran into the car.
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:36.720]  Shit.
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:40.260]  No, no, you just sort of like ran into it.
[03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:42.220]  Armor on, armor on.
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:43.160]  Yeah, yeah, I got it.
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:44.600]  Oh my god.
[03:02:46.420 --> 03:02:46.920]  Well, buddy.
[03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:48.140]  Nope.
[03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:52.460]  You gotta stop hitting these signs here, man.
[03:02:56.460 --> 03:02:56.860]  Nice.
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:58.420]  Yeah, I'm not feeling that.
[03:02:59.180 --> 03:03:00.000]  We're going up on the hill.
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:01.560]  I don't, like,
[03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:03.360]  what happened there, man?
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:05.880]  That was real bad. That was real shit.
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:07.940]  That was like, I don't know what you did.
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:09.680]  Like, you just kept running into signs.
[03:03:10.220 --> 03:03:11.820]  My camera got a bit wangled around,
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:13.300]  and then I just kept hitting stuff.
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:15.600]  Oh, you made the right call there.
[03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:18.260]  But one tire.
[03:03:19.340 --> 03:03:20.020]  Yeah, we need to,
[03:03:20.120 --> 03:03:21.520]  we might have to make a swap here in a minute.
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:22.380]  Okay.
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:24.600]  Okay.
[03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:26.260]  Okay, it's just a van.
[03:03:26.260 --> 03:03:26.860]  Yep.
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:28.680]  Can't go through that.
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:31.040]  Shoot him, Eric!
[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:32.040]  Got him.
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:33.440]  Nice.
[03:03:37.770 --> 03:03:39.750]  I was gonna suggest taking it,
[03:03:39.790 --> 03:03:40.690]  but there's so much shit arriving.
[03:03:40.970 --> 03:03:41.210]  Yeah.
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:46.300]  Oh my god.
[03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:49.680]  We need a car.
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:50.360]  Yeah.
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:51.720]  We need a car, son.
[03:03:52.940 --> 03:03:53.960]  Get back on the road.
[03:03:58.290 --> 03:03:59.090]  Anything coming?
[03:03:59.090 --> 03:04:01.190]  A couple of cop cars.
[03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:02.230]  Kill him.
[03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:03.290]  Got him.
[03:04:04.590 --> 03:04:05.490]  Taking it.
[03:04:07.790 --> 03:04:08.990]  Get in, get in.
[03:04:10.850 --> 03:04:11.830]  You fat idiot.
[03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:14.350]  Armor up, armor up.
[03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:17.830]  Holy shit.
[03:04:20.030 --> 03:04:20.650]  Good shooting, Nick.
[03:04:21.230 --> 03:04:21.690]  Thank you.
[03:04:21.730 --> 03:04:22.850]  You got your gun ready?
[03:04:23.610 --> 03:04:24.250]  What the fuck?
[03:04:24.250 --> 03:04:25.090]  There we go.
[03:04:26.650 --> 03:04:28.230]  I think I hit that rock last time, too.
[03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:32.030]  Hey, nice. Good shooting.
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:39.220]  Okay.
[03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:41.480]  Good, good, good, good.
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:41.940]  No pinch.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.040]  This is gonna be tough.
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:51.240]  Made quite a thump
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:52.360]  on that dude's body.
[03:04:56.720 --> 03:04:57.640]  We're okay, we're okay,
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:58.860]  we're okay, we're okay, we're okay.
[03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:00.760]  Keep going.
[03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:04.020]  Keep going, son.
[03:05:17.220 --> 03:05:18.200]  Oh my god.
[03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:20.560]  Oh, the turn. Oh, it was so bad.
[03:05:20.980 --> 03:05:22.580]  Rough turn. That was really bad.
[03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:23.980]  That guy's still alive.
[03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:30.900]  How you guys doing up there?
[03:05:31.080 --> 03:05:32.020]  We're parachuting down.
[03:05:32.260 --> 03:05:32.980]  Parachuting. Nice.
[03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:36.780]  Alright, Gavin, get ready.
[03:05:37.280 --> 03:05:38.240]  Blowing these guys away.
[03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:39.320]  Right through.
[03:05:39.320 --> 03:05:39.380]  Right through.
[03:05:40.620 --> 03:05:42.160]  Okay, watch your health, watch your armor.
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:45.640]  Yeah, the other way is definitely faster.
[03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:00.820]  Alright, just take it easy, take it nice.
[03:06:00.940 --> 03:06:01.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:11.180]  I could not be getting more text messages right now.
[03:06:14.760 --> 03:06:15.080]  Interesting.
[03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:20.320]  That's your favorite thing, though, when your phone blows up.
[03:06:20.340 --> 03:06:20.920]  Oh my god.
[03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:22.640]  It is just like,
[03:06:22.740 --> 03:06:23.800]  hey, are you in the middle of something?
[03:06:24.340 --> 03:06:26.020]  I have a lot of nothing to say to you.
[03:06:27.260 --> 03:06:28.920]  People just text you about nothing?
[03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:29.900]  All the time.
[03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:32.120]  All the time.
[03:06:32.380 --> 03:06:33.920]  I get text messages all the time.
[03:06:35.140 --> 03:06:36.220]  I mean, so many group texts.
[03:06:36.540 --> 03:06:37.500]  It's so many.
[03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:40.320]  I've got every group text I'm on, on silent.
[03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:42.580]  Smart. That's very smart.
[03:06:44.200 --> 03:06:46.480]  Watch your health, watch your armor.
[03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:47.100]  Yeah.
[03:06:49.820 --> 03:06:50.820]  Mixing the dinghy.
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:52.280]  Okay.
[03:06:56.820 --> 03:06:58.440]  The thing I'm worried about,
[03:06:58.580 --> 03:07:00.420]  is that we're gonna fly out of this thing,
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:02.040]  and we have helicopters on us.
[03:07:03.420 --> 03:07:04.100]  It's fine.
[03:07:05.120 --> 03:07:05.600]  Oh, okay.
[03:07:06.940 --> 03:07:08.000]  I wouldn't worry about it that way.
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:23.360]  Come on.
[03:07:24.380 --> 03:07:26.260]  Hopefully the drive's not that much longer than a minute.
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:26.620]  Nope.
[03:07:28.820 --> 03:07:29.440]  Stop.
[03:07:29.660 --> 03:07:30.820]  I don't even understand why there's a timer.
[03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:37.060]  Come on up here.
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:38.500]  Alright, over the bridge and off.
[03:07:38.940 --> 03:07:39.960]  Yep, here we go.
[03:07:40.540 --> 03:07:41.760]  Take your window away.
[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:45.920]  Let's go!
[03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:47.580]  Here we go.
[03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:48.520]  Nice.
[03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:55.260]  Okay.
[03:08:02.120 --> 03:08:02.740]  Okay.
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:05.300]  Just, uh...
[03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:06.800]  Everyone, shut up.
[03:08:13.420 --> 03:08:13.920]  Where's the boat?
[03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:15.940]  It's on the other side of these trees.
[03:08:18.280 --> 03:08:18.960]  Oh, yeah.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:27.520]  Nice.
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:33.740]  Please, swim.
[03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:34.880]  Get in.
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:39.800]  Go, go, go!
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:41.520]  Shut the fuck up, go!
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:44.980]  No timer, timer's gone.
[03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:48.500]  Oh my god, we were that close!
[03:08:48.500 --> 03:08:50.260]  I was in the sea!
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:52.120]  Oh, really?
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:53.840]  Oh, come on.
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:54.880]  One second away!
[03:08:55.500 --> 03:08:57.160]  Timer doesn't make any sense!
[03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:02.930]  Hey, thanks for watching.
[03:09:03.210 --> 03:09:04.650]  Um, that was part 12.
[03:09:06.010 --> 03:09:06.310]  Yes!
[03:09:07.150 --> 03:09:07.590]  The heist?
[03:09:08.310 --> 03:09:10.890]  If you made it through the longest video
[03:09:10.890 --> 03:09:12.110]  we've ever made, congratulations.
[03:09:12.210 --> 03:09:13.170]  Oh my god.
[03:09:16.110 --> 03:09:17.290]  That was like...
[03:09:17.290 --> 03:09:19.670]  False psychopath just headbutted a wolf.
[03:09:22.370 --> 03:09:23.850]  Piece of shit.
[03:09:27.230 --> 03:09:30.210]  You will not believe what happened to us.
[03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:35.230]  We were stuck in a time loop.
[03:09:51.010 --> 03:09:54.450]  Yeah, first time.
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:22.160]  Skip it.
[03:10:23.180 --> 03:10:24.000]  I tried.
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.130]  You better believe I tried.
[03:10:31.980 --> 03:10:34.080]  Well, I think we stress tested a lot of our equipment today.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:35.320]  We sure did.
[03:10:35.680 --> 03:10:36.060]  Yeah.
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.740]  There's money in our account.
[03:10:42.060 --> 03:10:43.180]  Hit the enter button.
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:48.000]  Confirm transfer.
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:10:58.260]  Okay, the money.
[03:10:58.900 --> 03:11:01.220]  Here, and here.
[03:11:03.580 --> 03:11:04.260]  And...
[03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:05.680]  Here, and...
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:06.300]  High five!
[03:11:06.680 --> 03:11:07.580]  Lots of hand touching.
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:12.260]  Are you a big fan of hand touching?
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:14.400]  Nah.
[03:11:15.020 --> 03:11:15.700]  Fuck.
[03:11:20.940 --> 03:11:21.620]  Yeah!
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:23.220]  Woo!
[03:11:26.980 --> 03:11:27.660]  Achievement!
[03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:31.560]  Potential take.
[03:11:31.740 --> 03:11:32.360]  Actual take.
[03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:32.980]  Ooh.
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:36.200]  Just $85,000.
[03:11:38.100 --> 03:11:39.520]  Do not quit and restart.
[03:11:40.220 --> 03:11:40.560]  Oh no.
[03:11:40.660 --> 03:11:41.200]  Didn't do that.
[03:11:45.770 --> 03:11:47.930]  Another 15 JP's for the bank.
[03:11:48.190 --> 03:11:48.470]  Yeah.
[03:11:49.450 --> 03:11:50.210]  Job points.
[03:11:50.770 --> 03:11:52.910]  GTA 6, that's really gonna be important.
[03:11:53.810 --> 03:11:56.410]  Yeah, all the job points you got in GTA 5 will suddenly become usable.
[03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:57.330]  And 6.
[03:11:58.270 --> 03:11:58.830]  Carries over.
[03:12:01.850 --> 03:12:01.990]  Okay.
[03:12:02.710 --> 03:12:03.550]  Look at us.
[03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:09.390]  That's right.
[03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:12.270]  That was a Pacific standard job.
[03:12:13.730 --> 03:12:15.170]  I don't think it might be substandard.
[03:12:25.040 --> 03:12:26.320]  Oh, we did it.
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:28.020]  Thank you.
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:31.840]  You flew out of frame.
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:35.180]  Thank you so much for...
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:37.180]  Thank you so much for watching.
[03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:38.760]  Make sure you check out our Patreon.
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:40.640]  If you made it this far.
[03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:42.320]  We're different people.
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:44.680]  We need to shut down.
[03:12:45.140 --> 03:12:45.800]  And just end this.
[03:12:45.900 --> 03:12:48.320]  But we'll be back in the future with more heists.
[03:12:48.740 --> 03:12:49.740]  Check out our podcast.
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:52.200]  Regulation Pod.
[03:12:52.780 --> 03:12:54.160]  We got a store, we got a Patreon.
[03:12:54.260 --> 03:12:55.720]  We got all sorts of good stuff.
[03:12:56.720 --> 03:12:57.580]  We love you.
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:12:58.880]  And thank you for watching.
[03:12:59.620 --> 03:12:59.820]  Bye.
[03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:01.580]  Do you wanna see how I get in buildings?
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:02.900]  What?
[03:13:03.820 --> 03:13:05.160]  Do you wanna see how I get in buildings?
[03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:05.760]  Sure.
[03:13:08.780 --> 03:13:09.180]  Nice.
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:10.540]  Talk to you later.
