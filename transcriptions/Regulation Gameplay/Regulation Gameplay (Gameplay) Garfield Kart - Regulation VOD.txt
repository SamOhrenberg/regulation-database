[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  We're playing Garfield Kart, Andrew, they can see it now.
[00:03.060 --> 00:04.380]  They can see it now?
[00:04.560 --> 00:05.680]  They can see the Garfield Kart.
[00:06.060 --> 00:09.860]  Well, we gotta, I believe, Garfield the movie releases today.
[00:09.980 --> 00:12.840]  I gotta celebrate that... in theaters.
[00:13.380 --> 00:14.820]  So we're gonna be playing some Garfield Kart.
[00:15.400 --> 00:18.820]  I think people could join us, potentially, while we're watching.
[00:19.180 --> 00:19.880]  How would they do that?
[00:19.900 --> 00:22.580]  I can do online multiplayer, so let's see.
[00:22.780 --> 00:26.600]  And then I think... I mean, I can't imagine many people are playing.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.720]  I would think no people are playing.
[00:29.720 --> 00:31.120]  Yeah, I would think that's probably right.
[00:31.180 --> 00:34.620]  I also think you should probably do a single race to start and we'll see what's going on.
[00:34.920 --> 00:36.980]  So if you guys have Garfield Kart...
[00:37.560 --> 00:40.780]  Oh, I meant a single race in multiplayer instead of a Grand Prix.
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.080]  Hey, to the dude that just said...
[00:44.080 --> 00:45.300]  I didn't think I was being that confusing.
[00:45.640 --> 00:47.660]  When he said hi to me this morning at breakfast,
[00:47.720 --> 00:49.040]  he was sorry because his mouth was full.
[00:49.100 --> 00:51.260]  I had no idea. You pulled it off beautifully.
[00:51.420 --> 00:51.900]  I would have never known.
[00:51.900 --> 00:52.380]  Oh, great work.
[00:53.220 --> 00:57.440]  Guys, if you have Garfield Kart, join up right now.
[00:57.660 --> 00:58.640]  Garfield Kart it up.
[00:58.640 --> 01:00.520]  Andrew is going to play the single race.
[01:00.600 --> 01:01.680]  We're going to see what... Oh, wow.
[01:01.740 --> 01:02.840]  Look at all that. Who's the mouse?
[01:03.400 --> 01:04.220]  What's the mouse's name?
[01:04.220 --> 01:05.440]  Let's get Tina in this game.
[01:05.920 --> 01:06.920]  His name is Squeak?
[01:07.720 --> 01:08.540]  Oh, he's got a cool hat.
[01:09.120 --> 01:09.320]  Whoa.
[01:09.580 --> 01:10.300]  He does have a cool hat.
[01:10.340 --> 01:11.980]  I think we can customize this.
[01:12.300 --> 01:20.120]  The way the characters move in this game looks like the Red Hot Chili Peppers Californication music video.
[01:27.420 --> 01:28.640]  What do we think for hat?
[01:29.360 --> 01:30.360]  Squeak. What are we feeling?
[01:31.180 --> 01:32.100]  I think he's a chef.
[01:32.460 --> 01:33.300]  He's a ratatouille.
[01:35.200 --> 01:36.300]  You like the ratatouille?
[01:36.420 --> 01:37.180]  That's a little on the nose.
[01:37.320 --> 01:38.960]  I kind of like the Howie Mandel personally.
[01:39.480 --> 01:40.220]  Oh, yeah? Do it.
[01:40.280 --> 01:40.800]  Go one left.
[01:42.160 --> 01:42.640]  There you go.
[01:42.980 --> 01:43.540]  Elasto hat.
[01:43.740 --> 01:45.080]  You got some jump height on that one, dude.
[01:46.660 --> 01:47.720]  How do people join?
[01:48.480 --> 01:54.240]  It's crazy to think that the Deal or No Deal guy got famous putting a glove on his head.
[01:54.780 --> 01:56.480]  It's really what he did. That and Bobby's World.
[01:56.660 --> 01:57.180]  That was about it.
[01:57.400 --> 01:57.500]  Yeah.
[01:58.560 --> 01:58.900]  Insane.
[01:59.140 --> 01:59.900]  Okay, so...
[01:59.900 --> 02:01.520]  The Manic.
[02:01.600 --> 02:02.760]  Oh, you had someone in there.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.540]  Oh, I did?
[02:04.780 --> 02:04.960]  Yeah.
[02:05.100 --> 02:05.900]  The Maniac.
[02:06.220 --> 02:06.920]  I don't know.
[02:07.460 --> 02:11.560]  You don't want to go up against somebody named the Maniac.
[02:12.080 --> 02:12.640]  All right, guys.
[02:12.680 --> 02:12.880]  Okay.
[02:13.260 --> 02:15.240]  How do you join this game?
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.760]  I guess you just open the game and you go find a game?
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.260]  I think you just... yeah, I guess based on that.
[02:20.320 --> 02:21.380]  That's why I was going to go host.
[02:21.520 --> 02:21.940]  Oh, look.
[02:22.140 --> 02:26.060]  The person who was in your game is in the chat, but not anymore.
[02:26.540 --> 02:27.160]  Threatening you.
[02:27.780 --> 02:30.500]  People join by just going to online multiplayer.
[02:30.840 --> 02:31.720]  They're back!
[02:32.260 --> 02:33.060]  Look at that.
[02:34.360 --> 02:35.140]  That's very exciting.
[02:36.340 --> 02:37.160]  I'm going to go random.
[02:37.600 --> 02:37.920]  Okay.
[02:38.640 --> 02:39.440]  This is good.
[02:39.780 --> 02:41.860]  Guys, if you want to join in, you can.
[02:41.980 --> 02:44.540]  If not, this is a one-on-one multiplayer race.
[02:44.540 --> 02:45.880]  He just did it.
[02:45.940 --> 02:47.080]  He just did it.
[02:47.340 --> 02:49.340]  He didn't even... Andrew didn't even wait.
[02:49.620 --> 02:51.240]  He just fucking did it.
[02:51.280 --> 02:53.540]  I hit A before and it wouldn't let me.
[02:53.700 --> 02:54.160]  I'm ready.
[02:54.360 --> 02:56.100]  So I was hoping the Maniac would not...
[02:56.100 --> 02:56.740]  All right, guys.
[02:56.760 --> 02:57.300]  Here we go.
[02:57.420 --> 02:59.000]  First Garfield Kirby.
[02:59.020 --> 03:01.240]  I haven't played this game in so long.
[03:01.500 --> 03:02.980]  I'm just going after the Maniac.
[03:03.100 --> 03:07.400]  How embarrassing is it going to be if the Maniac just throttles him?
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.360]  Guys, if it looks laggy and choppy, it's because I am screen sharing a Discord window sent to me by Canada.
[03:14.940 --> 03:15.300]  So...
[03:15.300 --> 03:15.760]  It looks good.
[03:15.940 --> 03:17.700]  You know, it's just a lot.
[03:20.500 --> 03:21.900]  Gotta pop those lasagnas.
[03:22.200 --> 03:23.360]  What does the lasagnas do?
[03:23.900 --> 03:24.400]  Oh, shit.
[03:25.040 --> 03:25.860]  What are you doing?
[03:26.120 --> 03:27.180]  It's you and the...
[03:27.180 --> 03:28.460]  I was the Maniac.
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.380]  Me and the Maniac.
[03:29.500 --> 03:29.940]  Oh, shit.
[03:30.160 --> 03:30.740]  Walling it up.
[03:30.940 --> 03:33.060]  I made a joke that Tina should join in.
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.720]  She says she does own the game, so maybe she'll pop in.
[03:35.280 --> 03:37.340]  Tina, you don't own Garfield Kart, do you?
[03:38.460 --> 03:39.640]  All the true gamers do.
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.260]  You don't own this?
[03:40.880 --> 03:42.140]  Fuck no, I don't own this.
[03:42.140 --> 03:44.880]  Dude, I bought this game when Andrew started talking about it.
[03:45.280 --> 03:48.960]  And I was gonna spend a weekend getting better than him at it without letting him know.
[03:49.140 --> 03:53.860]  I spent about four hours on a Friday night realizing that I would have to devote the rest of my life.
[03:54.120 --> 03:54.940]  Oh, no!
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.360]  And, uh, that was it.
[04:01.250 --> 04:02.150]  Oh, Jesus.
[04:02.390 --> 04:05.950]  This is, like, the worst Diddy Kong Racing-ass game.
[04:06.250 --> 04:07.830]  I don't think I've ever watched this.
[04:09.010 --> 04:10.450]  Oh, I'm coming for you, Manic.
[04:10.450 --> 04:12.490]  Oh, get the fuck out of here, Manic.
[04:13.450 --> 04:18.430]  Tina just texted me a picture of her installing Garfield Kart.
[04:23.570 --> 04:29.610]  Guys, if you have Garfield Kart, you'll be able to join in because no one else is playing online multiplayer.
[04:30.050 --> 04:31.610]  We thought that was gonna help you. It hurt you.
[04:32.510 --> 04:33.030]  You fool.
[04:33.910 --> 04:39.150]  We should see if we can host an OXM demo disc multiplayer session sometime.
[04:40.490 --> 04:42.070]  See if we can get the crew going.
[04:42.250 --> 04:46.470]  Yeah, like, could we fill up a crew multiplayer lobby on the demo disc?
[04:46.670 --> 04:47.710]  That'd be amazing.
[04:48.410 --> 04:52.370]  People are asking if this is the first one or the second one. Is there more than one Garfield Kart?
[04:52.450 --> 04:52.810]  This is the second one.
[04:52.890 --> 04:54.290]  This is the second Garfield Kart.
[04:54.530 --> 04:56.710]  The first one is even worse.
[04:56.970 --> 04:59.770]  Is there, like, a name for it? Is this, like, Garfield Kart...
[04:59.770 --> 05:02.190]  This is Garfield Kart Furious Racing.
[05:03.730 --> 05:04.530]  Furious Racing?
[05:04.970 --> 05:08.790]  I bel... or maybe it's a pun on Furry. Maybe it's Furrious Racing.
[05:08.970 --> 05:09.570]  That makes sense.
[05:09.570 --> 05:10.930]  You're in second place, dude.
[05:12.770 --> 05:15.230]  Yeah, but there's a... one has a huge lead.
[05:15.330 --> 05:17.390]  Yeah, do you think that's Manic?
[05:18.410 --> 05:19.710]  I don't think it is.
[05:19.810 --> 05:20.510]  You don't think so?
[05:21.170 --> 05:24.750]  I don't think so based on watching Manic drive into a wall.
[05:25.890 --> 05:28.790]  Like, I think Manic is absolutely first.
[05:29.610 --> 05:37.460]  Oh, you almost hit that spring again. That was good, dude. Way to go.
[05:39.620 --> 05:41.280]  I mean, I used to be good at this.
[05:41.280 --> 05:45.640]  I mean, hey, if you say so, man, who am I to call you a liar on stream?
[05:46.840 --> 05:51.020]  You were the number one player in the world until other people discovered the game.
[05:51.140 --> 05:53.480]  Until other people, yeah, decided to play.
[05:53.480 --> 05:56.340]  Yeah, three other people bought the game and you went, fuck me, and down to four, huh?
[05:58.060 --> 06:01.040]  No, I don't think I'm even in the top five or ten anymore.
[06:01.260 --> 06:02.040]  Wow, brutal.
[06:02.400 --> 06:03.360]  I think I might be fully out.
[06:03.580 --> 06:04.560]  Manic is, or what?
[06:06.440 --> 06:07.280]  That would be a funny...
[06:07.840 --> 06:08.400]  Oh, I'll get second.
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.340]  That'd be a funny bit.
[06:09.480 --> 06:14.420]  If you could be number one at any video game in the world, like everybody could be number one at one game.
[06:14.540 --> 06:16.800]  But if you told people, then they could beat your time.
[06:16.880 --> 06:18.080]  So you just had to keep it a secret.
[06:18.640 --> 06:22.340]  Guard the game that you're good at with your life.
[06:23.800 --> 06:27.680]  People are saying, quick Google search says this is not cross-play.
[06:27.780 --> 06:29.780]  So make sure you get it on Xbox. Is that right, Andrew?
[06:30.240 --> 06:32.220]  Oh, yeah, yeah, no, it's not cross-play.
[06:32.400 --> 06:34.960]  See, Harry, Harry was number one. Damn.
[06:36.040 --> 06:38.620]  Manic had four. Fuck you, Manic, respectfully.
[06:39.260 --> 06:42.140]  Do you think that's Harry Styles or Prince Harry?
[06:43.220 --> 06:45.300]  It's one of the two, I think.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.720]  Alright, so don't ready up this time. Wait for more people.
[06:49.080 --> 06:49.880]  Guys, if you go...
[06:49.880 --> 06:50.380]  Tina!
[06:50.840 --> 06:51.900]  You can join.
[06:52.480 --> 06:55.240]  Tina has joined the race.
[06:55.880 --> 06:57.080]  Oh, my God.
[06:57.420 --> 07:01.240]  There are three people on the eight billion person planet Earth right now playing this game.
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.900]  I thought my wife was supposed to be having lunch with Tina today.
[07:05.300 --> 07:07.460]  And now Tina's playing Garfield Kart.
[07:07.880 --> 07:08.720]  This is a mess.
[07:09.260 --> 07:10.380]  This is what's going on.
[07:10.840 --> 07:16.240]  Tina is the pool guy your wife is secretly getting lunch with on the side.
[07:17.460 --> 07:18.540]  Nobody else ready up?
[07:18.600 --> 07:20.360]  Did you just ready up? Don't do that.
[07:20.560 --> 07:25.700]  Because I was trying to change my hat and I instinctually push A to confirm I'm customizing.
[07:26.140 --> 07:27.160]  And it doesn't matter.
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.340]  Oh, fuck, the timer's going.
[07:29.700 --> 07:31.100]  Don't! Why did you do that?
[07:31.620 --> 07:33.340]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.200]  Somebody's like, Geoff has the game. Why isn't he playing?
[07:35.420 --> 07:36.600]  That's a great point. I can play too.
[07:37.960 --> 07:39.960]  You absolutely could play. I thought you were.
[07:40.180 --> 07:41.000]  That was one of the...
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.420]  I was ready to take you on. I don't think we've ever played.
[07:44.100 --> 07:46.560]  Alright, Tina. Tina, show them how it's done.
[07:48.700 --> 07:50.300]  And then go to a delicious lunch.
[07:54.750 --> 07:57.730]  Fuck, okay, I didn't remember. There's something with the start time.
[07:58.730 --> 08:01.210]  Hey, calm down, Manic. You used to be good at this.
[08:02.170 --> 08:04.310]  I used to be great at this. You used to be the best.
[08:05.250 --> 08:06.510]  Damn. I was.
[08:07.110 --> 08:08.570]  Alright, don't worry, I'm loading it up now.
[08:09.330 --> 08:11.330]  Are you really? This level's kind of tricky.
[08:11.770 --> 08:12.510]  Oh, this is great.
[08:15.770 --> 08:17.210]  I love... I don't know who hit, but...
[08:17.210 --> 08:22.010]  I love that someone watching this jumped on the Manic and then the other person that jumped on was Tina.
[08:24.530 --> 08:27.750]  That is so fucking good. Wow. Holy shit.
[08:28.950 --> 08:29.610]  He missed.
[08:32.750 --> 08:34.230]  Oh, what a shortcut.
[08:36.710 --> 08:38.030]  Oh, no. Fuck.
[08:40.710 --> 08:43.130]  Drop in there. Drop in there. Right there. Boom. Drop it.
[08:43.970 --> 08:45.310]  Too late. You had it, dude.
[08:47.250 --> 08:48.610]  No one's gonna hit that bad spot.
[08:49.630 --> 08:51.490]  Oh, there you go. Good. Nice shot.
[08:52.150 --> 08:53.270]  Track him down.
[08:54.370 --> 08:55.130]  There you go.
[08:55.410 --> 08:57.150]  I don't know what that is. You don't want to touch that.
[08:58.070 --> 08:59.430]  Arlene's on your fucking tail, bro.
[09:00.810 --> 09:01.310]  That was close.
[09:01.530 --> 09:02.590]  That's a shortcut. Yeah.
[09:03.370 --> 09:05.630]  Alright, here we go. Lock in. Lock in. Lock in.
[09:07.010 --> 09:07.790]  Damn, you missed.
[09:09.410 --> 09:11.350]  I don't know. I thought it would auto-track. Yeah, me too.
[09:11.690 --> 09:12.430]  I thought I had it.
[09:13.590 --> 09:14.850]  Isn't that something you'd remember?
[09:16.410 --> 09:18.130]  You would... Yeah. You'd think.
[09:18.230 --> 09:19.650]  Yeah. Oh, fuck.
[09:20.610 --> 09:22.690]  You got Arlene sniped, bro.
[09:23.450 --> 09:25.070]  Maybe not if you just played it.
[09:25.190 --> 09:28.210]  But if you were the number one player in the world, I had it.
[09:29.650 --> 09:29.970]  Maybe.
[09:30.510 --> 09:31.530]  Okay, here we go. Here we go.
[09:31.630 --> 09:33.450]  Alright, you're locked in right here. You're locked in right here, Andrew.
[09:33.890 --> 09:35.470]  Oh, that was so close.
[09:35.650 --> 09:38.050]  They're using my advice. They were springing when it was sprung, bro.
[09:39.590 --> 09:41.030]  Look out. Alright, hit it.
[09:41.190 --> 09:42.670]  Hit it. Zip, zap, zoom. Go.
[09:43.150 --> 09:44.370]  Go. Oh, you're out of here.
[09:45.470 --> 09:46.150]  Oh! No!
[09:46.910 --> 09:48.130]  You got abducted. Andrew!
[09:48.130 --> 09:49.130]  No!
[09:50.130 --> 09:51.770]  Oh, you fool!
[09:52.370 --> 09:53.430]  You're in third?
[09:54.590 --> 09:55.710]  You got probed.
[09:55.850 --> 09:56.430]  For long.
[09:58.730 --> 10:01.110]  Dude, first the worst, second the best.
[10:01.750 --> 10:04.130]  Hey, I know it's technically podcast talk.
[10:04.770 --> 10:05.910]  But can we get a little update?
[10:06.010 --> 10:06.530]  How you sitting?
[10:07.790 --> 10:08.850]  Oh, great.
[10:09.290 --> 10:10.730]  I am so cozy.
[10:11.070 --> 10:13.770]  Listen, I'd be fucking last place in pain.
[10:14.050 --> 10:15.050]  I forgot about that.
[10:15.050 --> 10:16.990]  I mean, it's a whole new world now.
[10:17.390 --> 10:18.110]  That's good.
[10:18.510 --> 10:20.930]  I was just proofing episode three earlier today.
[10:21.670 --> 10:25.690]  I forgot how much of it is that fucking chair.
[10:26.010 --> 10:26.810]  It's very funny.
[10:26.870 --> 10:29.090]  Fighting with Andrew about using his own chair.
[10:30.010 --> 10:30.810]  I'm sitting!
[10:35.270 --> 10:36.750]  Oh, it's a gamble.
[10:37.250 --> 10:38.170]  Just make it.
[10:38.230 --> 10:39.310]  You got it.
[10:39.750 --> 10:41.390]  Yeah! First place.
[10:46.010 --> 10:46.730]  Searching for...
[10:46.730 --> 10:47.890]  I'd like to thank the Viking hat.
[10:48.050 --> 10:50.370]  I'd like to thank this Herman Miller chair.
[10:52.330 --> 10:54.850]  I'd like to thank Eric for fixing my streaming errors.
[10:55.110 --> 10:55.750]  You know what?
[10:55.930 --> 10:58.270]  This is what I do semi-professionally.
[11:00.190 --> 11:01.750]  Yeah, so do I, but like...
[11:01.750 --> 11:02.490]  Yeah, if you say so.
[11:02.910 --> 11:04.990]  Tina, eighth place! Oh, no!
[11:05.130 --> 11:05.950]  Well, she picked Odie.
[11:06.730 --> 11:08.510]  It's a classic Odie move, you know what I mean?
[11:10.490 --> 11:12.110]  Okay, don't ready up.
[11:12.110 --> 11:12.990]  I'm not gonna...
[11:14.030 --> 11:15.630]  Attempting to connect to the game. I'm in.
[11:15.750 --> 11:16.670]  Geoff is in!
[11:17.790 --> 11:19.190]  Pregnant Apple is in!
[11:22.110 --> 11:23.350]  Oh, fretful trout!
[11:23.750 --> 11:24.830]  Infinite vortex!
[11:26.050 --> 11:26.870]  One more!
[11:29.310 --> 11:31.890]  Oh, fretful trout's really like their name on Twitch and everything, too.
[11:31.950 --> 11:32.330]  That's funny.
[11:34.590 --> 11:36.610]  I think it's really funny that we can't get one more.
[11:36.630 --> 11:37.670]  And AI ate!
[11:37.910 --> 11:38.750]  That's crazy.
[11:39.830 --> 11:40.950]  I'm just gonna start...
[11:41.550 --> 11:42.770]  I would say don't stick with squeak.
[11:42.930 --> 11:44.490]  I say change it up.
[11:44.590 --> 11:45.370]  You wanna swap it up?
[11:45.910 --> 11:46.890]  That's me personally.
[11:47.250 --> 11:50.930]  I want you to go with the animal that you like the most.
[11:51.410 --> 11:54.090]  I think Odie was the best character to go with.
[11:54.190 --> 11:55.630]  They all have different stats.
[11:55.710 --> 11:55.890]  Okay.
[11:56.150 --> 11:57.750]  I understand how a racing game works.
[11:57.750 --> 11:59.450]  Now the timer is automatically starting.
[11:59.450 --> 12:01.090]  So you gotta make your selections.
[12:02.810 --> 12:04.330]  Are you Viking Odie then?
[12:04.430 --> 12:05.570]  Is that your move? What are you doing?
[12:06.530 --> 12:07.730]  I'm gonna be...
[12:07.730 --> 12:08.930]  Lincoln Odie.
[12:09.310 --> 12:09.790]  Whoa.
[12:11.510 --> 12:12.550]  That's pretty cool.
[12:13.350 --> 12:15.030]  Alright, guys. We got it.
[12:15.710 --> 12:16.970]  Seven of the eight.
[12:17.130 --> 12:18.470]  And this is cats in the hood.
[12:19.710 --> 12:21.530]  I wonder when the last time somebody fielded
[12:21.530 --> 12:23.290]  seven players in this game was.
[12:24.190 --> 12:25.490]  It's probably been a minute.
[12:26.290 --> 12:27.710]  Now I remember this one.
[12:28.350 --> 12:28.710]  Oh, yeah?
[12:30.010 --> 12:31.250]  Yeah, this is...
[12:31.250 --> 12:31.650]  Whoa!
[12:31.650 --> 12:32.050]  Whoa!
[12:33.930 --> 12:34.870]  One I did a lot.
[12:34.950 --> 12:36.250]  I probably played this level the most.
[12:39.010 --> 12:39.550]  Uh-oh.
[12:40.110 --> 12:40.530]  Fuck.
[12:42.090 --> 12:43.690]  Dude, the Manic is right there.
[12:44.090 --> 12:45.390]  It's fucking crazy.
[12:46.890 --> 12:48.390]  Oh, look at that shortcut.
[12:49.710 --> 12:51.170]  Is there like a...
[12:51.170 --> 12:52.010]  turbo...
[12:52.010 --> 12:54.770]  Yeah, if you hold A and drift,
[12:54.950 --> 12:56.030]  the more you drift, the more you drift.
[12:56.030 --> 12:57.050]  It's like Mario Kart.
[12:57.050 --> 12:58.550]  Pretend you're Yoshi. Hold A.
[12:59.110 --> 12:59.850]  Oh, okay.
[13:00.210 --> 13:02.190]  And then...
[13:02.810 --> 13:05.430]  Andrew with a commanding lead here.
[13:06.330 --> 13:07.150]  Two normals
[13:07.150 --> 13:08.310]  in second and third.
[13:10.430 --> 13:13.030]  He is just running away with it here.
[13:15.570 --> 13:16.730]  Rough place to draw.
[13:16.850 --> 13:18.370]  See, I once was good.
[13:23.380 --> 13:24.600]  Look at this turn.
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.320]  Look at that.
[13:26.740 --> 13:28.080]  Do we have, like,
[13:28.080 --> 13:30.160]  subs and stuff on for this yet or no?
[13:30.880 --> 13:31.740]  No, we can't
[13:31.740 --> 13:32.980]  until the IRS thing is fixed.
[13:33.180 --> 13:36.900]  Thanks, America.
[13:40.400 --> 13:41.680]  Fretful Trout in the back!
[13:41.940 --> 13:43.680]  Oh, lap him, lap him, lap him.
[13:43.800 --> 13:44.380]  Aw, damn it.
[13:45.860 --> 13:47.280]  Boom, three. Done.
[13:49.400 --> 13:50.220]  Cats in the hood.
[13:50.340 --> 13:51.300]  Easiest level in the game.
[13:51.640 --> 13:53.460]  It is the first level.
[13:54.120 --> 13:55.820]  It is easily the one I spend the most time with.
[13:55.820 --> 13:57.600]  Without trying, you are going to
[13:57.600 --> 13:58.800]  lap Fretful Trout.
[14:01.630 --> 14:02.300]  The AI.
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.360]  AI lap.
[14:05.500 --> 14:07.020]  Fretful Trout is a person.
[14:08.560 --> 14:09.840]  Oh, Geoff, seventh place
[14:09.840 --> 14:10.800]  behind Tina!
[14:11.600 --> 14:12.860]  Way to go, Tina.
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.240]  Fretful Trout says,
[14:17.340 --> 14:17.720]  I can't drive.
[14:18.140 --> 14:21.300]  Normal 2-3, baby.
[14:24.220 --> 14:25.120]  That was good.
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.020]  Let's get the next one going.
[14:28.220 --> 14:29.560]  Should we maybe do a Grand Prix?
[14:30.000 --> 14:30.240]  Maybe.
[14:30.420 --> 14:32.500]  That's up to you, man.
[14:32.960 --> 14:33.880]  Let's do a Grand Prix.
[14:34.400 --> 14:35.240]  Yeah, let's do it, Andrew.
[14:36.560 --> 14:38.000]  If you're up to it.
[14:39.440 --> 14:41.120]  I'm just waiting for the game to move me on.
[14:41.380 --> 14:41.760]  What do you mean?
[14:43.500 --> 14:45.020]  It's not proceeding.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.540]  I'm just stuck in the screen.
[14:47.360 --> 14:47.420]  No.
[14:50.400 --> 14:51.120]  I'm just waiting.
[14:52.180 --> 14:52.440]  Really?
[14:53.140 --> 14:54.100]  Go to Geoff's card.
[14:55.720 --> 14:56.160]  Okay.
[14:56.680 --> 14:57.760]  No, don't go to mine.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.140]  Don't look at it.
[15:01.180 --> 15:01.960]  Don't look at it!
[15:02.080 --> 15:03.960]  I think you should change friendship.
[15:04.880 --> 15:05.720]  I'm offline.
[15:07.060 --> 15:07.840]  Change friendship.
[15:09.280 --> 15:10.800]  He's your favorite, but you're not friends, huh?
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.140]  We're just friends.
[15:12.940 --> 15:13.840]  Now we're favorites.
[15:13.900 --> 15:16.860]  Okay, so are you trapped right now?
[15:18.380 --> 15:19.080]  I mean, yeah.
[15:19.200 --> 15:20.180]  I can't do anything.
[15:20.180 --> 15:22.780]  Okay, do we need to quit out of it and I need to dip away for a second?
[15:22.920 --> 15:23.260]  Or what?
[15:24.140 --> 15:26.300]  I don't know. Is everyone else in the screen, I wonder?
[15:26.880 --> 15:28.260]  Geoff, are you stuck in the finish screen?
[15:28.360 --> 15:29.440]  I'm stuck in the screen.
[15:29.940 --> 15:30.220]  Okay.
[15:31.380 --> 15:32.900]  I'm going to close the game.
[15:33.040 --> 15:35.580]  I just went to the logo. You can go ahead and close the game.
[15:36.120 --> 15:36.760]  Garfield card!
[15:36.860 --> 15:38.000]  We are back!
[15:41.040 --> 15:41.680]  Launching... play...
[15:41.680 --> 15:43.980]  Alright, let's do online multiplayer. Let's Grand Prix it, baby.
[15:44.160 --> 15:44.920]  Guys, now's your chance.
[15:46.380 --> 15:47.020]  Join up.
[15:47.920 --> 15:49.500]  Fight Andrew and Garfield Kart.
[15:49.760 --> 15:50.260]  Right now.
[15:51.060 --> 15:52.820]  Also, maybe Geoff, if he can figure it out.
[15:53.940 --> 15:55.000]  I always figure it out.
[15:55.280 --> 15:56.560]  Alright, Geoff, join up. Hurry.
[15:56.640 --> 15:58.420]  I gotta do the lasagna cup.
[16:01.610 --> 16:02.350]  Oh, weird.
[16:02.590 --> 16:04.190]  Put me in a...
[16:04.190 --> 16:05.610]  Individual race. Let me try again.
[16:05.670 --> 16:08.330]  You are not... yeah, infinite vortex is in here, but you're not.
[16:08.610 --> 16:08.990]  Infinite vortex figured it out.
[16:08.990 --> 16:10.350]  You need to get out, dude.
[16:10.370 --> 16:11.010]  Hold on, hold on.
[16:14.810 --> 16:15.810]  Tina's back in here.
[16:15.810 --> 16:19.570]  We're being raided by Ray himself.
[16:20.030 --> 16:20.330]  Oh, shit.
[16:20.810 --> 16:21.770]  Oh, whoa.
[16:23.170 --> 16:24.110]  Alright, I'm in now.
[16:24.170 --> 16:24.870]  I'm gonna be in now.
[16:25.370 --> 16:27.290]  I was gonna scream,
[16:28.130 --> 16:30.210]  but I don't know if we're legally allowed to.
[16:30.510 --> 16:32.090]  Okay, guys, we filled it up.
[16:32.270 --> 16:33.210]  Let's do it.
[16:34.250 --> 16:35.170]  I'm locking in.
[16:35.250 --> 16:36.950]  We're locking in right now, guys.
[16:37.750 --> 16:39.910]  How's it going? Welcome to Regulation Podcast.
[16:40.530 --> 16:41.890]  We're playing video games.
[16:42.030 --> 16:42.530]  That's Odie.
[16:43.370 --> 16:44.910]  He is Abraham Lincoln.
[16:45.210 --> 16:46.830]  Big hat with a card in it.
[16:47.330 --> 16:47.890]  Very cool.
[16:48.010 --> 16:48.650]  Tina's here.
[16:48.830 --> 16:50.330]  So is Geoff.
[16:50.570 --> 16:51.450]  Geoff, are you gonna win?
[16:52.170 --> 16:52.410]  No.
[16:53.090 --> 16:53.330]  What?
[16:54.470 --> 16:57.230]  What about the last 20 years of my career
[16:57.230 --> 16:59.690]  has shown me A, to be a winner,
[16:59.830 --> 17:01.130]  or B, to be good at video games?
[17:01.470 --> 17:02.370]  I don't watch your stuff.
[17:02.430 --> 17:03.410]  I'm guaranteed to win.
[17:03.730 --> 17:06.370]  I can't even win by getting you to watch my content.
[17:06.370 --> 17:07.890]  We'd make a fucking company together.
[17:11.710 --> 17:14.170]  3, 2, 1, action, go!
[17:14.690 --> 17:17.530]  This Grand Prix will be much like most of my life.
[17:17.630 --> 17:19.190]  It'll be unrealized opportunity.
[17:19.770 --> 17:20.490]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[17:21.350 --> 17:23.230]  Just letting that sand slip between your fingers, huh, bud?
[17:23.710 --> 17:23.990]  Yeah.
[17:25.490 --> 17:28.250]  Dude, Andrew is like...
[17:28.250 --> 17:30.090]  This is dominating right now.
[17:30.150 --> 17:31.050]  Who's in 8th?
[17:31.090 --> 17:33.310]  Who's normal in 8th place who just ain't going?
[17:34.330 --> 17:34.790]  There we go.
[17:34.790 --> 17:36.370]  They figured it out. They figured out the buttons.
[17:39.210 --> 17:39.730]  Oh, shit.
[17:39.930 --> 17:41.010]  Oh, no, you're sleeping.
[17:41.450 --> 17:42.630]  Oh, they put me to sleep.
[17:44.290 --> 17:44.650]  Damn.
[17:46.850 --> 17:48.750]  What a commanding lead, though, dude.
[17:48.750 --> 17:49.590]  You're about to dominate.
[17:49.710 --> 17:52.090]  You're gonna pass 8th.
[17:52.450 --> 17:54.770]  It's probably fretful trout again or something, too.
[17:56.990 --> 17:58.550]  Will these be available on VOD later?
[17:58.770 --> 17:59.430]  Yes, it will.
[17:59.530 --> 18:01.390]  We're recording it so that way we can edit it
[18:01.390 --> 18:04.890]  and put it out on our regulation podcast channel,
[18:05.010 --> 18:06.890]  which is different from the regulation pod.
[18:06.990 --> 18:07.830]  One's a gameplay one.
[18:07.990 --> 18:09.350]  Just subscribe to both.
[18:09.450 --> 18:10.090]  Don't worry about it.
[18:10.550 --> 18:13.550]  It'll hurt your head too much to try to make sense of it.
[18:13.550 --> 18:14.590]  Oh, I'll lap somebody.
[18:14.890 --> 18:17.510]  Imagine trying to figure it out and it's your livelihood
[18:17.510 --> 18:18.710]  instead of just a funny joke.
[18:18.710 --> 18:20.810]  Yeah, it's like how you're gonna pay your bills.
[18:21.310 --> 18:23.730]  Oh, where you can follow us is
[18:23.730 --> 18:26.010]  patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[18:26.010 --> 18:26.410]  No!
[18:26.910 --> 18:27.350]  No!
[18:27.350 --> 18:28.270]  Uh-oh.
[18:28.470 --> 18:30.590]  Oh, Andrew, you got lapped by
[18:30.590 --> 18:31.850]  8th place.
[18:32.630 --> 18:35.090]  Dude, you just got dominated by It's Marksilly.
[18:36.630 --> 18:38.330]  That's one way to phrase it.
[18:40.170 --> 18:40.770]  Dominated.
[18:41.130 --> 18:41.830]  Dominated by him.
[18:42.430 --> 18:43.030]  Dominated.
[18:46.820 --> 18:48.480]  Get him. Attack Marksilly.
[18:49.760 --> 18:51.680]  I wish I could swap to see the other competitors.
[18:52.160 --> 18:52.820]  Fucking diamond.
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.780]  The fact that I won in this hat
[18:56.780 --> 18:59.320]  with all the win resistance, truly impressive.
[18:59.380 --> 19:00.320]  Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[19:01.580 --> 19:03.080]  You got 4 points for that?
[19:03.140 --> 19:03.540]  Is what happened?
[19:04.780 --> 19:06.840]  Man, Infinite Vortex, Pregnant Apple,
[19:07.020 --> 19:08.900]  and It's Marksilly fucking suck.
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.400]  Dude.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.120]  I was fighting words.
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.180]  We have fun.
[19:18.380 --> 19:20.380]  I think if you hit right trigger right before
[19:20.380 --> 19:21.820]  you get a boost.
[19:22.160 --> 19:23.220]  Nope, that wasn't it.
[19:23.220 --> 19:24.060]  Oh, there we go.
[19:24.280 --> 19:27.720]  Great name.
[19:28.760 --> 19:30.400]  So this is basically right trigger and A.
[19:31.140 --> 19:31.740]  The whole game.
[19:32.320 --> 19:33.500]  Welcome to the racing games.
[19:33.800 --> 19:35.940]  What the fucking asshole did that to me?
[19:36.240 --> 19:38.040]  And then occasionally throwing stuff.
[19:38.560 --> 19:39.780]  Because I said you sucked, isn't it?
[19:40.800 --> 19:41.000]  Yeah.
[19:42.360 --> 19:43.880]  Oh, what a drift.
[19:49.780 --> 19:51.140]  Andrew's rocking right here.
[19:53.220 --> 19:54.760]  It's trying to remember these levels.
[19:55.600 --> 19:57.400]  You can tell which ones I spent
[19:57.400 --> 19:59.460]  more time on than...
[19:59.460 --> 20:01.120]  Like that Egypt level I never really liked.
[20:02.140 --> 20:02.960]  Doing before.
[20:03.100 --> 20:04.720]  So I didn't spend a lot of time playing it.
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.200]  Oh, the pie.
[20:07.420 --> 20:08.240]  Uh-oh.
[20:08.780 --> 20:09.880]  Could not course correct.
[20:10.080 --> 20:11.140]  But you're in a strong...
[20:11.140 --> 20:11.880]  Oh, now I'm sleeping.
[20:12.520 --> 20:16.240]  Oh, the calories from the pie.
[20:16.440 --> 20:18.520]  Remember at the beginning where we were making fun of you
[20:18.520 --> 20:20.140]  because it didn't look like you were doing that good
[20:20.140 --> 20:22.420]  and then now you're just absolutely dominating
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.260]  this competition.
[20:24.160 --> 20:24.960]  Typical Andrew.
[20:25.580 --> 20:25.740]  Yeah.
[20:28.960 --> 20:29.960]  Look at him go.
[20:31.800 --> 20:33.100]  He's gotta cut through those.
[20:33.300 --> 20:34.920]  Use your boost and drive through the sand.
[20:35.100 --> 20:37.300]  Tina, you at least have to beat Geoff.
[20:38.160 --> 20:39.160]  That's not a problem.
[20:40.140 --> 20:42.140]  I'm bringing up the fucking rear.
[20:45.380 --> 20:47.260]  I'm back here going, hey guys, wait up.
[20:47.400 --> 20:47.960]  I don't know the way.
[20:48.560 --> 20:50.700]  Fellas, fellas, stay on my eyesight.
[20:50.780 --> 20:51.740]  I don't know where to go.
[20:56.310 --> 20:57.250]  You know what's funny is
[20:57.250 --> 20:59.130]  much like when I got the world records
[20:59.130 --> 21:01.290]  if any of these people continued to play
[21:01.290 --> 21:03.230]  for an hour more, they would be crushing me.
[21:03.830 --> 21:04.650]  It's just the
[21:05.330 --> 21:07.490]  advantage of experience by a little bit.
[21:08.070 --> 21:09.030]  You fucking asshole.
[21:09.150 --> 21:10.470]  As soon as any of them learned how to
[21:10.470 --> 21:13.390]  do the drift or whatever at the beginning.
[21:14.170 --> 21:15.430]  It's lasagna confidence, you know.
[21:16.430 --> 21:17.890]  It is lasagna confidence.
[21:18.190 --> 21:18.250]  Yep.
[21:20.390 --> 21:21.490]  Is there any tracking
[21:21.490 --> 21:23.210]  for the Garfield movie today? I haven't looked.
[21:23.350 --> 21:24.210]  How are we doing, I wonder.
[21:24.430 --> 21:26.690]  I don't think he made any money, actually. Geoff came in last.
[21:26.890 --> 21:29.270]  So what happened is that he is Garfield.
[21:29.530 --> 21:31.490]  So Garfield is bad
[21:31.490 --> 21:32.230]  and don't go see it.
[21:33.530 --> 21:34.790]  Wait to see a good movie.
[21:35.330 --> 21:37.590]  Like Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[21:38.770 --> 21:39.590]  Or The Crow.
[21:42.370 --> 21:43.450]  Go see The Crow.
[21:44.310 --> 21:45.590]  Go see The Crow.
[21:45.790 --> 21:47.550]  Hey, if you're gonna see Garfield,
[21:47.550 --> 21:49.610]  don't see that and see Totally Similar.
[21:50.310 --> 21:50.750]  No.
[21:51.690 --> 21:53.670]  Wait to see...
[21:53.670 --> 21:55.750]  Kevin Costner would be a white guy
[21:55.750 --> 21:56.310]  on a horse.
[21:56.970 --> 21:58.470]  Oh, in part 2?
[21:59.150 --> 22:00.850]  In part 1. Don't see part 2.
[22:01.170 --> 22:03.370]  I'm waiting for part 4. Part 1 is the only part that matters.
[22:03.570 --> 22:04.710]  You get most of the story in it.
[22:05.610 --> 22:07.270]  You get most of the story.
[22:07.830 --> 22:09.710]  It's funny because the reviews say otherwise.
[22:12.370 --> 22:13.510]  The reviews say
[22:13.510 --> 22:15.330]  all of these characters and plots
[22:15.330 --> 22:17.530]  don't get explained across these 3 hours.
[22:17.670 --> 22:18.250]  Oh, that's funny.
[22:18.590 --> 22:20.850]  Dude, it's Mark Sully is just dominating you right now.
[22:20.910 --> 22:21.230]  Oh!
[22:23.370 --> 22:25.310]  That was some Fast and Furious shit.
[22:25.670 --> 22:26.910]  What a snipe.
[22:28.870 --> 22:30.070]  You get Wesley sniped?
[22:30.470 --> 22:32.370]  There you go. Good spot.
[22:33.970 --> 22:35.610]  Oh, you fucking turd.
[22:35.710 --> 22:36.410]  I like it.
[22:39.180 --> 22:39.600]  There you go.
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.700]  Right in front of the boost too.
[22:41.840 --> 22:43.000]  That is classic.
[22:43.000 --> 22:43.920]  Oh, little mean.
[22:44.960 --> 22:46.520]  That's the way you gotta do it.
[22:46.760 --> 22:47.680]  Ride high on these right here.
[22:47.820 --> 22:48.940]  Do tricks in the air or something.
[22:50.680 --> 22:53.060]  I don't remember how to do it, but there's a way to fly through.
[22:53.280 --> 22:54.640]  Oh, no!
[22:55.620 --> 22:56.960]  Oh, they sent me off course.
[22:56.980 --> 22:58.200]  Go to sleep, Odie.
[22:58.560 --> 22:59.660]  Hit him with the GTS.
[23:04.100 --> 23:04.780]  That was awesome.
[23:05.200 --> 23:06.540]  Is there a wrestler with the GTS?
[23:06.740 --> 23:07.200]  Oh, no.
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.180]  Wake up.
[23:11.080 --> 23:11.720]  Time to get up.
[23:13.780 --> 23:16.020]  Alright, Andrew, you gotta make this S-turn right here.
[23:16.080 --> 23:17.400]  Make this curve. Make it count.
[23:17.500 --> 23:18.220]  Nice and easy.
[23:18.820 --> 23:19.480]  You got it.
[23:20.480 --> 23:22.120]  Easy. Easy.
[23:22.400 --> 23:23.680]  Come on, Geoff.
[23:24.680 --> 23:26.240]  We got this, buddy.
[23:27.500 --> 23:28.220]  Oh, no.
[23:29.740 --> 23:30.620]  Fourth place!
[23:31.400 --> 23:32.420]  Oh, no, it's only round three.
[23:32.580 --> 23:33.280]  Shit, it's not over.
[23:35.560 --> 23:37.520]  Geoff thought he was in fourth place.
[23:37.760 --> 23:38.540]  I thought it was over.
[23:40.440 --> 23:41.700]  I was so proud of myself.
[23:42.440 --> 23:43.500]  Right out in the middle.
[23:44.160 --> 23:45.180]  Right where I belong.
[23:46.960 --> 23:47.780]  Put him to sleep.
[23:48.020 --> 23:49.880]  Nope. Damn, I thought it was going to be funny again.
[23:50.180 --> 23:50.920]  Alright, hit these curves right here.
[23:50.940 --> 23:53.320]  Hard left. Drop it here.
[23:53.460 --> 23:54.440]  Now, go, go, go.
[23:55.880 --> 23:56.880]  Now, drift.
[23:57.480 --> 23:58.200]  More drift action.
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.260]  More drift.
[24:01.300 --> 24:02.300]  Fucking Tokyo drift.
[24:03.420 --> 24:04.220]  Odio drift.
[24:04.400 --> 24:04.880]  Oh, my God.
[24:08.140 --> 24:09.640]  Boom. Easy dominated.
[24:09.640 --> 24:10.720]  Drop it. Done.
[24:12.020 --> 24:13.840]  Oh, I can smell that lasagna.
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.280]  Just checked.
[24:15.400 --> 24:17.660]  Andrew is number two in Cats in the Hood.
[24:17.780 --> 24:20.760]  Beaten out by someone at a .07 second speed.
[24:21.000 --> 24:21.280]  Fourth place!
[24:22.140 --> 24:22.980]  I'm two?
[24:23.160 --> 24:25.500]  I thought I lost that by a lot.
[24:28.060 --> 24:29.580]  On Cats in the Hood,
[24:29.700 --> 24:31.260]  you're like dominated, dude.
[24:31.320 --> 24:31.780]  That's awesome.
[24:33.680 --> 24:35.140]  Tina with eighth.
[24:35.140 --> 24:36.860]  Sorry, Tina. That's tough.
[24:36.860 --> 24:38.860]  That's tough. I get it.
[24:41.040 --> 24:41.800]  Infinite Vortex, man.
[24:42.160 --> 24:43.680]  You can still take it.
[24:44.960 --> 24:47.040]  If they beat me on this one, I think they get it.
[24:48.740 --> 24:51.180]  Which doesn't make sense because I was first twice,
[24:51.320 --> 24:53.340]  but based on how the points are being distributed,
[24:53.620 --> 24:54.880]  I fucked that up so bad.
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.180]  What'd you do?
[24:56.400 --> 24:58.500]  Infinite Vortex is way faster than you, dude.
[24:59.960 --> 25:00.620]  Come on, Vortex.
[25:00.760 --> 25:01.280]  Show them how it's done.
[25:01.400 --> 25:03.320]  See about that.
[25:04.420 --> 25:04.920]  Damn.
[25:06.120 --> 25:07.320]  See about that.
[25:08.100 --> 25:09.940]  Oh, I got so lucky that I had a lasagna.
[25:10.140 --> 25:11.220]  Yeah, pretty much.
[25:13.120 --> 25:13.620]  Nice.
[25:13.760 --> 25:15.820]  You're rocking this thing right now, dude.
[25:19.150 --> 25:20.550]  Oh, fuck. Okay.
[25:20.870 --> 25:21.290]  Drift.
[25:22.190 --> 25:25.110]  There you go. That's the move right there.
[25:25.350 --> 25:25.790]  Oh!
[25:27.690 --> 25:28.650]  Geoff, how you doing?
[25:29.170 --> 25:30.070]  I'm doing good.
[25:30.690 --> 25:31.410]  How are you doing?
[25:32.170 --> 25:33.090]  Okay, not...
[25:33.090 --> 25:34.470]  I meant, like, what place are you in?
[25:34.550 --> 25:35.370]  How's it looking?
[25:36.110 --> 25:37.970]  Give me your fucking update.
[25:37.970 --> 25:40.730]  If I tell you, then the people I'm racing against
[25:40.730 --> 25:42.230]  are going to have insider information.
[25:43.230 --> 25:43.530]  Okay.
[25:44.310 --> 25:45.930]  I'm in second place right now.
[25:46.290 --> 25:46.970]  Are you really?
[25:47.470 --> 25:47.930]  Yeah.
[25:48.690 --> 25:50.490]  Wow. That's pretty awesome.
[25:50.610 --> 25:52.070]  Oh, shit, I see you coming up on the map.
[25:52.190 --> 25:52.630]  Garfield.
[25:53.050 --> 25:53.350]  Oh!
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.130]  That's me. I'm Garfield.
[25:54.750 --> 25:55.690]  Damn, that's pretty cool.
[25:56.530 --> 25:57.890]  Take a nap, Odie.
[25:57.910 --> 25:59.810]  Just constantly taking me to sleep.
[26:02.030 --> 26:02.990]  Look at him go.
[26:03.310 --> 26:04.330]  Oh, fuck!
[26:06.230 --> 26:07.470]  Geoff's in first!
[26:07.950 --> 26:08.610]  Geoff's in first!
[26:08.610 --> 26:09.690]  Geoff's in first!
[26:11.010 --> 26:12.130]  I gotta catch you.
[26:14.090 --> 26:14.610]  Zap him.
[26:16.370 --> 26:17.770]  Oh, is it a teleport?
[26:18.050 --> 26:18.830]  Yeah, I think so.
[26:19.970 --> 26:20.710]  Holy shit!
[26:20.710 --> 26:22.850]  Oh, shit!
[26:22.850 --> 26:23.490]  Take that, Vortex!
[26:25.710 --> 26:26.990]  Snuck into first!
[26:27.330 --> 26:28.070]  Holy shit.
[26:28.410 --> 26:29.590]  You gotta take the shortcut. There you go.
[26:30.630 --> 26:31.310]  No!
[26:33.030 --> 26:34.190]  No, Vortex!
[26:35.150 --> 26:36.390]  Holy shit!
[26:37.310 --> 26:38.410]  Oh, I gotta catch up.
[26:39.030 --> 26:39.290]  No!
[26:39.770 --> 26:40.690]  Why am I sleeping?
[26:42.330 --> 26:44.030]  I wasn't even first!
[26:44.230 --> 26:46.430]  Oh, my God! You're in fifth?
[26:47.370 --> 26:47.910]  No!
[26:47.910 --> 26:48.850]  No!
[26:50.870 --> 26:51.430]  Gotta catch up!
[26:52.070 --> 26:53.730]  You're getting dominated by Geoff!
[26:53.970 --> 26:55.110]  Stop hitting me!
[26:55.930 --> 26:56.930]  I'm in sixth!
[26:58.270 --> 27:00.350]  Tina was ahead of you.
[27:00.470 --> 27:01.270]  Went off the map.
[27:04.170 --> 27:04.830]  Come on, Andrew!
[27:05.910 --> 27:06.310]  Andrew!
[27:08.310 --> 27:08.870]  No!
[27:10.590 --> 27:11.150]  No!
[27:12.050 --> 27:13.870]  Vortex beat you!
[27:15.070 --> 27:15.750]  No!
[27:19.050 --> 27:20.830]  Did I lose the lasagna cup?
[27:20.910 --> 27:21.630]  I can smell it!
[27:21.710 --> 27:23.250]  Wait, how could you lose the lasagna cup?
[27:23.350 --> 27:24.590]  You were in first every time.
[27:25.450 --> 27:28.070]  I don't know, but the points made it seem like it was possible.
[27:28.510 --> 27:28.530]  No.
[27:29.330 --> 27:29.670]  No.
[27:31.530 --> 27:31.990]  Maybe.
[27:32.690 --> 27:35.250]  You got 12 for that one.
[27:37.150 --> 27:37.610]  Confirm.
[27:38.370 --> 27:38.750]  Oh, yeah.
[27:38.830 --> 27:39.590]  You dominated.
[27:41.470 --> 27:43.970]  Wow, congratulations to our winner,
[27:44.170 --> 27:45.030]  Andrew Panton.
[27:45.890 --> 27:46.610]  Second place!
[27:47.830 --> 27:49.290]  Look at infinite voices.
[27:50.630 --> 27:52.370]  Wow, I'm so impressed.
[27:52.950 --> 27:54.570]  Andrew, you gotta back out and start a new one.
[27:54.930 --> 27:55.930]  You gotta get new people in here.
[27:56.150 --> 27:57.750]  Okay, that's a good point.
[27:57.830 --> 27:59.950]  Guys, thank you so much for watching.
[28:00.070 --> 28:01.510]  Don't forget to check out our Patreon.
[28:01.730 --> 28:04.090]  Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[28:04.470 --> 28:06.090]  That's where you wanna go right now.
[28:06.390 --> 28:08.370]  Hey, thank you so much, Tina.
[28:08.670 --> 28:10.930]  Tell my wife I say hi, and we'll see you later.
[28:11.050 --> 28:12.110]  Thanks for dropping in for a little while.
[28:12.110 --> 28:12.430]  Thanks for joining, Tina.
[28:13.070 --> 28:14.290]  Say hi to the pool boy.
[28:15.770 --> 28:16.970]  Alright, Andrew, you gotta switch it up.
[28:17.010 --> 28:18.450]  You can't be Odie again. You gotta be someone else.
[28:19.010 --> 28:20.190]  I'm not allowed to be Odie again.
[28:20.270 --> 28:21.630]  You gotta be someone else. You gotta mix it up.
[28:21.770 --> 28:23.330]  Everybody knows Odie's OP.
[28:24.430 --> 28:25.390]  I'll be this cat.
[28:25.450 --> 28:27.370]  You're gonna be Harry? Gross. That's fine.
[28:29.570 --> 28:30.690]  Swap up the hat, too.
[28:30.810 --> 28:32.370]  Oh, sleepy Harry. I like that.
[28:32.370 --> 28:33.070]  I just like the feel of that.
[28:34.610 --> 28:35.330]  That's a good one.
[28:36.490 --> 28:38.370]  Alright, guys, get in now
[28:38.370 --> 28:40.270]  on this new Grand Prix.
[28:40.270 --> 28:42.150]  We are running this race
[28:42.150 --> 28:44.270]  hard and heavy with you.
[28:46.730 --> 28:48.110]  Let me know when you're hosting it.
[28:48.950 --> 28:49.970]  Manic is back.
[28:50.150 --> 28:52.490]  Apple is back. Ireland's call,
[28:52.730 --> 28:53.910]  I guess. Geoff is in.
[28:56.210 --> 28:58.150]  XTT Weapon TTX.
[28:58.870 --> 29:00.250]  Cool. And two more
[29:00.250 --> 29:02.290]  spots. One more spot
[29:02.290 --> 29:04.130]  open. ODST Beato.
[29:04.570 --> 29:06.530]  Who's the last one? AI8
[29:06.530 --> 29:08.270]  is going to be replaced with...
[29:09.690 --> 29:10.130]  It's
[29:10.130 --> 29:12.330]  MarkSully. Nice.
[29:13.870 --> 29:15.610]  This is the Burger Cup.
[29:16.930 --> 29:18.610]  I got personal connections to this.
[29:19.090 --> 29:19.750]  I need that burger.
[29:20.490 --> 29:22.230]  Alright, guys,
[29:22.290 --> 29:23.350]  ready up. It's time.
[29:28.950 --> 29:30.490]  XTT Weapon TTX
[29:30.490 --> 29:32.470]  says, look, okay, XD, I inherited
[29:32.470 --> 29:33.790]  this name. Wasn't my choice.
[29:34.070 --> 29:35.450]  Anytime you want to change it, man.
[29:35.450 --> 29:36.390]  I don't know what to tell you.
[29:37.070 --> 29:39.090]  This is the name my parents gave me.
[29:39.150 --> 29:40.850]  My father and his father before him.
[29:43.010 --> 29:44.450]  I'm an XTTX Jr.
[29:48.350 --> 29:48.910]  XTTX
[29:49.210 --> 29:50.110]  is my father.
[29:50.770 --> 29:52.230]  I think I just killed the Manic.
[29:53.130 --> 29:54.630]  Just another Manic Monday.
[29:57.650 --> 29:58.650]  Oh, no!
[30:01.410 --> 30:03.310]  Ireland's call out. Geoff in front!
[30:04.430 --> 30:05.450]  Oh, Geoff.
[30:05.530 --> 30:05.950]  Let's stop.
[30:06.250 --> 30:08.870]  Oh, there you go. Now you're in second.
[30:09.210 --> 30:11.310]  You said you were in first for a long time and you definitely weren't.
[30:12.650 --> 30:13.150]  Hit him.
[30:13.850 --> 30:15.170]  Oh, didn't even have to hit him.
[30:15.670 --> 30:16.070]  Oh!
[30:17.350 --> 30:18.670]  I went to another dimension.
[30:20.410 --> 30:20.890]  Listen, I
[30:20.890 --> 30:23.210]  went too fast. I went to like a black hole.
[30:23.390 --> 30:24.590]  No! Wow.
[30:24.830 --> 30:25.950]  I'm hitting everybody's cars.
[30:26.710 --> 30:27.650]  You're having a hard time.
[30:28.630 --> 30:29.850]  You're in last place.
[30:29.850 --> 30:31.270]  Oh, God.
[30:31.730 --> 30:32.610]  That's fine.
[30:33.390 --> 30:34.510]  Underdog story.
[30:35.110 --> 30:39.070]  Shout out to Underdog.
[30:41.610 --> 30:43.830]  At a parade somewhere
[30:43.830 --> 30:45.950]  right now in the Tri-State area.
[30:46.470 --> 30:46.950]  Andrew!
[30:47.870 --> 30:48.530]  What are you doing?
[30:49.850 --> 30:51.670]  A boost was too much.
[30:51.890 --> 30:52.830]  Eighth place?
[30:53.910 --> 30:54.970]  I'm going to get it back.
[30:55.670 --> 30:58.090]  Dude, you're getting a lot of perfumes here. What's going on?
[30:58.610 --> 30:59.610]  I don't know.
[31:00.310 --> 31:01.410]  You stinky little cat.
[31:02.550 --> 31:03.650]  He's a stinky little cat.
[31:03.830 --> 31:05.530]  He's a sleepy, stinky little cat.
[31:05.630 --> 31:08.090]  I want to say all the people adding Andrew as a friend
[31:08.090 --> 31:10.010]  and sending messages, I'm being so
[31:10.010 --> 31:12.130]  nice not saying anything right now.
[31:12.270 --> 31:13.950]  I'm just letting you know that I'm being
[31:13.950 --> 31:15.830]  so nice not saying anything.
[31:17.910 --> 31:20.230]  You got it, Andrew. Come on. You're in sixth. You can catch up.
[31:20.490 --> 31:21.770]  You got time. You got perfumes. Hit it.
[31:22.030 --> 31:23.550]  Perfume me. There you go.
[31:23.670 --> 31:25.570]  I just went right through the spring.
[31:25.570 --> 31:26.630]  You got it.
[31:28.070 --> 31:29.890]  You got another lap to catch up here.
[31:29.930 --> 31:31.250]  I know you're only in sixth. Oh my god.
[31:31.310 --> 31:32.050]  Too fast.
[31:33.250 --> 31:35.790]  This is Garfield Kart 2. The Fate of the Furious
[31:35.790 --> 31:36.670]  or whatever it's called.
[31:36.870 --> 31:38.330]  Yeah, Fate of the Furious.
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.540]  Geoff, are you still in first?
[31:45.740 --> 31:46.560]  No, dude.
[31:48.040 --> 31:48.660]  Oh, Andrew!
[31:49.420 --> 31:50.400]  Oh, no.
[31:51.340 --> 31:52.140]  Sixth place.
[31:56.840 --> 31:57.620]  Andrew's in sixth
[31:57.620 --> 31:58.920]  and he cannot climb. Here's fifth.
[31:58.920 --> 32:00.460]  You're in fifth. You're climbing.
[32:01.220 --> 32:02.620]  I'm making my way there.
[32:02.760 --> 32:02.840]  Yep.
[32:04.040 --> 32:05.520]  Oh my god.
[32:06.420 --> 32:09.460]  He set world record times driving like this?
[32:09.480 --> 32:09.940]  Oh my god.
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.020]  I don't know.
[32:12.680 --> 32:14.120]  He used to be good at Legendary 2
[32:14.120 --> 32:15.600]  and then at one point he lost it.
[32:15.900 --> 32:18.040]  He's got a shelf life on his abilities.
[32:18.900 --> 32:20.920]  You should see this guy play Halo.
[32:21.780 --> 32:22.520]  Oof. Brutal.
[32:23.380 --> 32:24.500]  Sixth place.
[32:25.080 --> 32:26.880]  Rough seventh place.
[32:26.880 --> 32:28.420]  That is real rough.
[32:28.620 --> 32:29.220]  Rough trade, bud.
[32:32.080 --> 32:32.640]  Man, Underdog.
[32:32.720 --> 32:33.800]  That's a great one to show Emily.
[32:33.920 --> 32:35.120]  I don't think I've ever shown her Underdog.
[32:35.440 --> 32:37.780]  That's a whole good saga.
[32:38.360 --> 32:39.900]  The Jason Lee animated film?
[32:40.220 --> 32:43.240]  Wait, you never showed Emily the Underdog saga?
[32:43.760 --> 32:44.600]  No, I don't think so.
[32:45.000 --> 32:45.400]  Really?
[32:45.680 --> 32:47.040]  I don't think it's ever come up.
[32:47.880 --> 32:49.260]  Oh, it was so good.
[32:49.660 --> 32:50.780]  We just did Oh Debbie.
[32:52.160 --> 32:55.040]  That might be the hardest I've laughed
[32:55.040 --> 32:55.900]  in the last year.
[32:56.540 --> 32:59.440]  It's so funny. When he's scratching his balls
[32:59.440 --> 33:00.960]  and he's like, if you were here, you'd benefit.
[33:01.220 --> 33:01.820]  Oh, so much.
[33:02.320 --> 33:04.020]  It's so fucking gross.
[33:04.500 --> 33:07.060]  He's such a tool. Watching Emily watch it
[33:07.060 --> 33:08.780]  for the first time, it'd get grossed out.
[33:09.200 --> 33:09.320]  Yeah.
[33:11.020 --> 33:11.720]  Oh, Debbie.
[33:12.540 --> 33:12.780]  Shit.
[33:14.620 --> 33:16.760]  Oh, no, I hit the fucking zombie.
[33:17.280 --> 33:18.560]  Andrew, you're in fifth?
[33:18.660 --> 33:19.600]  You're behind Geoff?
[33:20.100 --> 33:20.980]  Okay, there you go.
[33:22.160 --> 33:23.260]  I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[33:24.200 --> 33:25.000]  That's bullshit!
[33:25.300 --> 33:25.980]  I wasn't off!
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.120]  Andrew, I'm just going to say,
[33:28.300 --> 33:31.020]  I think Garfield Cart might be against you right now, dude.
[33:31.360 --> 33:33.380]  Oh, I'm agreeing.
[33:33.500 --> 33:34.520]  I think the game...
[33:34.520 --> 33:36.660]  This might be a Chicago Bears situation where you're just
[33:36.660 --> 33:37.780]  getting cheated out of it, dude.
[33:38.740 --> 33:39.500]  Oh, fuck.
[33:41.280 --> 33:42.960]  I think there's a conspiracy to prevent
[33:42.960 --> 33:44.960]  me from getting both the lasagna cup
[33:44.960 --> 33:46.860]  and the burger cup. It's too much.
[33:47.740 --> 33:48.960]  What is that?
[33:48.960 --> 33:50.200]  I landed flat!
[33:53.980 --> 33:54.660]  Ireland's call.
[33:54.840 --> 33:56.680]  Oh, St. Spagora, come on.
[33:56.980 --> 33:57.820]  Come on!
[33:57.840 --> 33:59.000]  I'm going to sleep!
[34:00.940 --> 34:01.980]  That's a rough match.
[34:02.660 --> 34:03.620]  Draft off him.
[34:05.180 --> 34:05.760]  I'm drafting.
[34:06.300 --> 34:07.180]  Oh, shit!
[34:08.100 --> 34:08.600]  Oh, no!
[34:09.840 --> 34:12.520]  This is easily the most violent round for me.
[34:12.880 --> 34:13.920]  This is crazy.
[34:14.340 --> 34:16.520]  I'm getting beat up by everybody!
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.700]  Everyone is beating me up!
[34:18.700 --> 34:19.960]  Andrew is...
[34:19.960 --> 34:21.260]  I just get smashed!
[34:24.100 --> 34:25.900]  Alright, do it. Now.
[34:26.100 --> 34:26.600]  Stupid snowman!
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.080]  It would have saved you!
[34:30.640 --> 34:31.980]  You didn't have the guts!
[34:33.500 --> 34:33.920]  Ah!
[34:35.000 --> 34:36.500]  Eighth place?
[34:36.720 --> 34:37.180]  No!
[34:37.320 --> 34:37.900]  Andrew!
[34:39.780 --> 34:41.600]  Oh, my God.
[34:42.200 --> 34:43.160]  Dude, you start...
[34:43.160 --> 34:44.100]  Oh, the collapse!
[34:44.160 --> 34:46.280]  It really is like...
[34:46.280 --> 34:48.620]  You're like a first-year quarterback on the field
[34:48.620 --> 34:49.860]  when it all starts going wrong.
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.280]  The quicksand comes through
[34:52.280 --> 34:53.500]  and you're falling apart, bud.
[34:54.080 --> 34:56.620]  But the pack, for the most part, is right here.
[34:56.680 --> 34:57.540]  I can make up on this.
[34:58.580 --> 35:00.340]  You're on lap two of three.
[35:00.580 --> 35:02.680]  I mean, you got one more lap to make this happen.
[35:03.440 --> 35:04.660]  Imagine losing to Geoff.
[35:04.800 --> 35:05.580]  That's all I'm saying.
[35:06.460 --> 35:08.080]  Well, I'm not...
[35:08.080 --> 35:08.780]  ahead of him.
[35:11.360 --> 35:13.040]  Eat my stinky dust!
[35:13.100 --> 35:14.440]  Big B says it's karma
[35:14.440 --> 35:16.300]  for burger confidence.
[35:18.000 --> 35:18.760]  Oh, no.
[35:19.020 --> 35:19.500]  Listen.
[35:20.400 --> 35:21.420]  I'm winning this race.
[35:22.100 --> 35:24.260]  Ain't no karma for no burger confidence.
[35:25.060 --> 35:25.700]  Stay to the right.
[35:25.980 --> 35:26.460]  Yep.
[35:28.480 --> 35:29.260]  You hit it anyway.
[35:29.680 --> 35:30.620]  Way to go, bud!
[35:31.980 --> 35:34.720]  That didn't sound like a sincere congratulations.
[35:35.780 --> 35:36.320]  No, it didn't.
[35:36.520 --> 35:37.460]  He's in second.
[35:38.060 --> 35:39.900]  How is he in second now?
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.820]  Oh, he's on your...
[35:41.820 --> 35:43.460]  How did that hit me?
[35:43.760 --> 35:45.600]  I was on the opposite...
[35:45.600 --> 35:46.800]  Oh, my God.
[35:49.100 --> 35:49.660]  This
[35:49.660 --> 35:51.680]  is crazy.
[35:52.340 --> 35:53.240]  I hate this map.
[35:54.400 --> 35:55.640]  Andrew is, like,
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.480]  falling apart. Oh, Andrew.
[35:57.820 --> 35:58.900]  Tried for the shortcut.
[35:59.660 --> 36:01.800]  Might have done your head in, bud.
[36:02.200 --> 36:02.860]  Back to fifth.
[36:03.160 --> 36:06.160]  Yeah, that may have been it.
[36:06.880 --> 36:07.920]  I took a swing
[36:07.920 --> 36:08.760]  and it didn't work.
[36:08.760 --> 36:10.620]  I thought that that shortcut
[36:10.620 --> 36:12.460]  was gonna pay off. Hey, what a
[36:12.460 --> 36:14.920]  climb from eighth
[36:14.920 --> 36:15.760]  to fifth.
[36:16.980 --> 36:18.640]  I was second. Sixth.
[36:20.540 --> 36:22.660]  I gotta hit you. Oh, you barely beat me.
[36:23.820 --> 36:24.160]  Yeah.
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.800]  What's really bad is I have all
[36:28.800 --> 36:30.700]  those things unlocked where nobody else ahead
[36:30.700 --> 36:32.560]  of me does, and I think that helps my car.
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.500]  And the guy behind you has them unlocked
[36:34.500 --> 36:35.880]  and you still barely beat him.
[36:38.160 --> 36:38.640]  Oh.
[36:39.260 --> 36:40.200]  Oh, I know this one.
[36:40.980 --> 36:41.960]  Andrew, you got this.
[36:44.860 --> 36:45.940]  Andrew, I believe
[36:45.940 --> 36:47.700]  in you. Yeah?
[36:48.040 --> 36:49.920]  Yep. What's the...
[36:50.720 --> 36:51.660]  What am I hearing?
[36:51.780 --> 36:53.200]  What is the terrible music in the background?
[36:53.440 --> 36:55.320]  What do you mean? Andrew,
[36:55.900 --> 36:57.160]  from eighth to fifth,
[36:57.540 --> 36:58.700]  I believe in you.
[36:59.740 --> 37:01.660]  It's not about where you've been.
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.460]  It's about where you're going.
[37:05.880 --> 37:07.980]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[37:08.720 --> 37:10.340]  I'm thinking about...
[37:10.340 --> 37:10.740]  Oh!
[37:12.960 --> 37:13.720]  No!
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.200]  Oh!
[37:15.880 --> 37:17.840]  It's gonna be an uphill battle.
[37:18.340 --> 37:19.840]  Sometimes you're gonna have
[37:19.840 --> 37:21.120]  to lose.
[37:23.480 --> 37:23.900]  I love
[37:23.900 --> 37:24.940]  Andrew's singing voice.
[37:26.080 --> 37:27.760]  Come on, Andrew. You know
[37:27.760 --> 37:28.500]  what it is.
[37:31.580 --> 37:33.100]  It's a climb!
[37:35.520 --> 37:36.000]  Okay.
[37:36.280 --> 37:37.100]  I'm in sixth.
[37:37.360 --> 37:38.780]  I started thinking about
[37:39.320 --> 37:40.260]  Hannah Montana
[37:40.880 --> 37:43.040]  and it dropped me from first to sixth. No, no, look at this.
[37:43.200 --> 37:45.300]  You're all the way up to fourth and they're right there.
[37:45.640 --> 37:46.820]  Andrew, it's the climb.
[37:47.140 --> 37:48.980]  It's not about where you were. Oh, I'm climbing.
[37:48.980 --> 37:50.520]  It's about getting there. I'm climbing. Come on.
[37:50.760 --> 37:51.860]  It's the climb, Andrew. Oh, I'm climbing.
[37:52.600 --> 37:55.020]  Get out, Geoff. Let's go. I'm climbing.
[37:56.140 --> 37:57.040]  It's the climb.
[37:57.620 --> 37:58.640]  You can't stop me.
[37:58.860 --> 38:00.680]  You can't stop me. It's the climb. It's the climb.
[38:00.680 --> 38:01.720]  We're climbing.
[38:04.180 --> 38:05.540]  Oh, shit.
[38:07.120 --> 38:07.760]  Oh, man.
[38:08.180 --> 38:09.380]  Uphill battle.
[38:14.200 --> 38:16.360]  Andrew, right there. First place.
[38:16.420 --> 38:17.180]  Let's go.
[38:18.280 --> 38:20.580]  You named yourself after a side
[38:20.580 --> 38:22.520]  Halo game, dude. You ain't winning.
[38:22.900 --> 38:24.440]  You weren't even a main entry.
[38:25.100 --> 38:26.400]  You were a spin-off,
[38:26.500 --> 38:27.040]  my friend.
[38:28.820 --> 38:29.660]  Here we go.
[38:29.800 --> 38:30.420]  This is a good game, though.
[38:31.900 --> 38:33.840]  Geoff in the water. Geoff in the mud.
[38:34.300 --> 38:35.020]  No, I didn't go in.
[38:36.160 --> 38:37.780]  Third place. You got this.
[38:38.020 --> 38:38.800]  You got this.
[38:41.300 --> 38:42.060]  Andrew, it's about
[38:42.060 --> 38:43.780]  getting out there and fighting your fight.
[38:43.940 --> 38:45.740]  It's about doing your thing. You got this. Let's go.
[38:45.900 --> 38:47.640]  Come on. Blast him.
[38:47.920 --> 38:49.200]  Manic, you're done. Let's go.
[38:49.420 --> 38:50.860]  I'm blasting Manic.
[38:52.200 --> 38:52.980]  Take that pie.
[38:55.240 --> 38:55.780]  Spring him.
[38:58.340 --> 38:59.000]  Look at that.
[38:59.120 --> 39:00.780]  Look at this drift. No, the jump.
[39:02.000 --> 39:02.720]  Too early.
[39:02.900 --> 39:04.480]  Oh, nice. Took out the spring.
[39:11.340 --> 39:11.700]  No.
[39:13.320 --> 39:15.040]  Come on, Andrew. You're in third. You got this.
[39:15.100 --> 39:15.840]  They're right there.
[39:16.740 --> 39:17.580]  Take that, Geoff.
[39:21.020 --> 39:22.380]  Easy, easy on this. Easy.
[39:22.980 --> 39:23.320]  No.
[39:26.860 --> 39:27.820]  Hit him with it.
[39:27.820 --> 39:28.420]  Go, go, go.
[39:31.000 --> 39:31.720]  Wait, wait.
[39:34.240 --> 39:34.960]  Easy, easy.
[39:36.000 --> 39:36.800]  Oh, no.
[39:38.440 --> 39:39.160]  Bury it.
[39:39.340 --> 39:41.380]  Oh, no. That might be it. The climb.
[39:41.580 --> 39:42.700]  The climb might be done.
[39:43.340 --> 39:44.580]  There might be no more climbing.
[39:45.040 --> 39:46.780]  It was eighth. And then fifth.
[39:47.080 --> 39:49.140]  You got fourth right here. Third is in your sights.
[39:49.260 --> 39:50.540]  You just got to get in front of Manic.
[39:50.800 --> 39:52.220]  I think I'm going to run out of time.
[39:52.680 --> 39:54.100]  Can I at least beat him?
[39:54.100 --> 39:54.840]  No.
[39:55.700 --> 39:57.500]  Fourth place. Andrew, you got into fourth.
[39:57.780 --> 39:59.720]  Andrew, one more. It's the climb.
[40:00.100 --> 40:02.160]  Andrew, it's the climb. Fifth, right behind Andrew again.
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.980]  How does it feel to be only that much better than me?
[40:12.480 --> 40:13.220]  That's tough.
[40:13.920 --> 40:15.500]  That's a tough look.
[40:15.820 --> 40:16.920]  That is a tough look.
[40:17.840 --> 40:20.740]  Got beat by a game that was connected to a movie that got canceled.
[40:21.160 --> 40:21.640]  Embarrassing.
[40:25.660 --> 40:27.220]  Oh, I forgot there's a fourth race.
[40:27.260 --> 40:28.020]  Of course.
[40:28.260 --> 40:30.320]  Climb's back on. Andrew, this is the climb.
[40:31.120 --> 40:32.880]  This is it right here.
[40:32.960 --> 40:34.380]  Watch this. I'm going to get that blue boost.
[40:34.880 --> 40:36.000]  I'm coming right for you, ODST.
[40:36.300 --> 40:38.420]  Nope, I sure didn't. None of that happened.
[40:38.960 --> 40:40.960]  Not a single thing I said was going to happen happened.
[40:42.120 --> 40:43.900]  Oh, the fucking...
[40:43.900 --> 40:44.700]  Whatever that was.
[40:44.780 --> 40:45.760]  Ketchup or tomato.
[40:47.140 --> 40:47.600]  Oh!
[40:48.740 --> 40:50.260]  Everyone went to sleep.
[40:50.420 --> 40:51.600]  Everyone went the wrong way.
[40:52.240 --> 40:53.280]  Everyone went right.
[40:53.340 --> 40:54.280]  It was nap time.
[40:59.240 --> 41:00.860]  I mean, that was just...
[41:00.860 --> 41:02.260]  Geoff, how are you feeling about the climb right now?
[41:04.060 --> 41:06.320]  You know, I'm pretty consistently in fifth place.
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.920]  No matter how hard I try.
[41:08.460 --> 41:10.420]  Oh, so yours is more like it's the maintain.
[41:11.080 --> 41:12.120]  Yeah, I'm at the maintain.
[41:12.600 --> 41:12.900]  Okay.
[41:14.940 --> 41:16.680]  Oh, you made a mistake, weapon.
[41:17.660 --> 41:19.400]  You opened a door for the climb.
[41:19.580 --> 41:20.020]  Oh, no.
[41:21.340 --> 41:22.680]  It's not looking good at the moment, but it rarely is.
[41:22.680 --> 41:24.560]  You opened a door for the climb.
[41:27.800 --> 41:28.780]  Oh, there we go.
[41:29.240 --> 41:29.560]  Fuck.
[41:29.800 --> 41:30.620]  Okay, come on, maintain.
[41:31.640 --> 41:33.260]  Maintain, I'm about to...
[41:33.260 --> 41:34.400]  Get first on the first lap.
[41:34.460 --> 41:35.400]  Come on, you got it, you got it.
[41:35.560 --> 41:36.660]  This is the climb, Andrew.
[41:36.820 --> 41:38.040]  This is what it is, man.
[41:38.200 --> 41:39.040]  This is it right here.
[41:40.600 --> 41:41.240]  I'm climbing.
[41:44.960 --> 41:46.380]  Oh, I can't believe that connected.
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.460]  Yeah, there you go, there you go.
[41:47.460 --> 41:49.540]  Fuck whoever's back there.
[41:49.680 --> 41:50.400]  Enjoy those.
[41:51.940 --> 41:52.740]  Oh, shit.
[41:54.360 --> 41:55.520]  Oh, that might have helped you.
[41:56.040 --> 41:56.940]  That might have been good.
[41:56.940 --> 41:57.820]  It honestly may have.
[41:58.400 --> 42:00.600]  Right around this second bend, drop that pie.
[42:00.940 --> 42:02.140]  Right here, boom, pie it.
[42:02.680 --> 42:05.060]  Oh, man, someone's gonna be so annoyed.
[42:06.400 --> 42:07.740]  This fucked up someone's day with that pie.
[42:07.760 --> 42:08.520]  Absolutely, it's probably Geoff.
[42:09.760 --> 42:10.180]  I doubt it.
[42:10.220 --> 42:10.980]  Spring, boom.
[42:11.520 --> 42:14.660]  Right around those boxes, what are they supposed to do?
[42:14.660 --> 42:15.180]  Andrew!
[42:15.700 --> 42:18.200]  Listen, we're gonna straighten it out.
[42:18.240 --> 42:19.140]  Get your head in the game.
[42:19.820 --> 42:21.080]  I'm locking in.
[42:23.100 --> 42:23.600]  Climbing.
[42:25.340 --> 42:26.560]  A little surprise.
[42:26.620 --> 42:27.180]  There you go.
[42:27.760 --> 42:28.420]  Drop a pie.
[42:30.460 --> 42:34.820]  I'll say to everybody, I ignored all allergy notices on these pies.
[42:35.120 --> 42:37.560]  You may be in for a deadly surprise.
[42:39.480 --> 42:41.240]  Guys, this is the climb.
[42:41.320 --> 42:43.160]  He is locking in right now.
[42:43.160 --> 42:46.280]  Those are your pies, there's a spring, another pie.
[42:46.420 --> 42:47.340]  Let's go! Andrew!
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.720]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[42:49.740 --> 42:50.380]  Oh, no!
[42:51.320 --> 42:54.360]  No, you spin-off son of a bitch!
[42:56.260 --> 42:56.840]  Hit him with it.
[42:58.660 --> 42:59.660]  Gamble and lose.
[42:59.900 --> 43:00.400]  That's right.
[43:01.320 --> 43:03.580]  Hit him, go! Hard, fast.
[43:03.600 --> 43:05.160]  Nathan Fillion-loving son of a bitch.
[43:07.780 --> 43:09.640]  Really have it in for ODST today.
[43:10.960 --> 43:11.680]  He's winning.
[43:11.680 --> 43:13.540]  Don't, don't, don't.
[43:13.680 --> 43:14.000]  Andrew?
[43:14.880 --> 43:17.540]  I told you I'd figure it out by the end!
[43:18.520 --> 43:19.380]  Nailed it!
[43:22.720 --> 43:23.880]  I'm climbing!
[43:24.120 --> 43:24.640]  This is the climb.
[43:24.880 --> 43:27.020]  Oh, there's no stopping this climb.
[43:27.480 --> 43:28.180]  To fourth!
[43:28.740 --> 43:31.280]  Oh, it's the Everest run!
[43:33.440 --> 43:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the climb.
[43:37.580 --> 43:38.860]  Third place!
[43:38.980 --> 43:39.880]  Way to go, man.
[43:44.420 --> 43:44.820]  Incredible!
[43:48.880 --> 43:50.780]  Great ODST finish for the second, you think?
[43:50.960 --> 43:51.660]  Yeah, oh, definitely.
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.580]  I'm probably gonna be like, I don't think I even podiumed for the race overall.
[43:55.660 --> 43:56.120]  No, I didn't.
[43:56.260 --> 43:56.600]  Ooh!
[43:58.440 --> 44:01.260]  Marks Lee, ODST, and the Manic!
[44:02.220 --> 44:03.220]  The Hamburger Helpers!
[44:04.400 --> 44:04.920]  That's okay.
[44:05.040 --> 44:06.920]  I'm just chewing on my lasagna on the side.
[44:07.020 --> 44:07.520]  That's all right.
[44:08.440 --> 44:08.960]  Hell yeah.
[44:10.380 --> 44:10.780]  Wow!
[44:10.780 --> 44:11.980]  How much fun.
[44:11.980 --> 44:13.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, what a Garfield car.
[44:13.680 --> 44:15.320]  You gotta back out and get some new people in there.
[44:15.660 --> 44:16.960]  That is hot, baby.
[44:18.040 --> 44:20.400]  One more Grand Prix, and then I think we can wrap the stream.
[44:20.400 --> 44:21.400]  I love it, I love it.
[44:21.440 --> 44:23.320]  Guys, thank you so much for joining us so far.
[44:23.720 --> 44:26.580]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod.
[44:26.700 --> 44:28.620]  I keep saying it because we need your help.

[44:30.320 --> 44:32.520]  and forever we will live

[44:34.720 --> 44:35.600]  beautiful shadow
[44:35.600 --> 44:37.980]  as this movie releases.
[44:40.340 --> 44:41.240]  What do we think?
[44:41.420 --> 44:42.320]  Pizza or ice cream?
[44:42.400 --> 44:42.960]  Ice cream, maybe?
[44:43.520 --> 44:45.360]  When does that content come out?
[44:46.580 --> 44:47.620]  I don't know.
[44:47.620 --> 44:48.900]  I don't think it's until next week, maybe.
[44:49.960 --> 44:51.140]  I really don't remember.
[44:51.240 --> 44:52.380]  I don't think it's on the calendar yet.
[44:55.760 --> 44:57.780]  We got a video.
[44:57.940 --> 44:59.540]  Hey guys, if you're watching this special,
[44:59.640 --> 45:01.100]  I'm gonna let you know what we have coming out tomorrow.
[45:01.500 --> 45:03.100]  We got Ratatouille coming out.
[45:03.320 --> 45:05.720]  If you are familiar with Ratatouille, check it out.
[45:06.700 --> 45:07.520]  We got that.
[45:07.580 --> 45:09.080]  Yeah, I still don't know what that is.
[45:09.180 --> 45:11.260]  I did the thumbnail for it, but I don't know what.
[45:11.380 --> 45:12.800]  It's a series you guys are doing?
[45:12.960 --> 45:15.880]  Me and Andrew... Andrew decided that we should
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.380]  play a game that I would like,
[45:17.600 --> 45:19.260]  and that game is Ratatouille.
[45:19.860 --> 45:20.720]  And it is...
[45:20.720 --> 45:21.840]  The rat thing?
[45:22.720 --> 45:24.980]  Let me tell you that we've done...
[45:24.980 --> 45:27.060]  I think we've done four...
[45:27.060 --> 45:28.660]  I think four parts of it.
[45:29.160 --> 45:31.580]  And that's how I learned that Andrew
[45:31.580 --> 45:33.720]  is a...
[45:34.240 --> 45:35.620]  Andrew's a bonus content guy.
[45:37.420 --> 45:37.860]  So...
[45:37.860 --> 45:39.300]  It is...
[45:39.300 --> 45:40.400]  It's really something.
[45:40.580 --> 45:42.820]  You gotta get that bonus content. I think we got outvoted.
[45:42.920 --> 45:44.660]  I think we're doing Hamburger Cup again. Some redemption.
[45:44.820 --> 45:46.820]  Wow! Hamburger Cup again? Damn, okay.
[45:47.100 --> 45:47.900]  Show them. Show them how it's done.
[45:48.520 --> 45:50.600]  We have that coming out tomorrow.
[45:50.780 --> 45:52.540]  And then Sunday, I think on Patreon,
[45:53.880 --> 45:54.320]  is...
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.020]  Do we have our next draft coming out on Sunday?
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.880]  The Villain Death Draft is coming out on Sunday.
[45:59.880 --> 46:01.120]  The Villain Death Draft comes out on Sunday.
[46:01.120 --> 46:03.180]  It's gonna be fantastic. If you haven't joined the Patreon...
[46:03.960 --> 46:04.480]  Patreon only.
[46:05.420 --> 46:06.920]  What's a Villain Death Draft?
[46:07.440 --> 46:09.000]  It's where we're picking the
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.360]  best villain deaths
[46:12.080 --> 46:13.140]  of all time.
[46:13.320 --> 46:14.900]  Movies and TV, pretty much.
[46:15.400 --> 46:17.020]  We're sharing clips of them also.
[46:17.140 --> 46:17.940]  That's why it has to be on Patreon.
[46:18.640 --> 46:21.100]  We have to put it on Patreon. Otherwise it can't come out.
[46:21.580 --> 46:23.320]  Because it is clips of
[46:23.320 --> 46:24.660]  movie villains dying.
[46:25.180 --> 46:26.460]  So, check it out.
[46:26.520 --> 46:28.240]  And you can't have people die on Patreon.
[46:28.240 --> 46:29.460]  I mean, you can.
[46:29.820 --> 46:31.280]  You have to do it on Patreon.
[46:33.500 --> 46:34.360]  I think
[46:34.360 --> 46:36.460]  Gracie also participated in that one.
[46:36.820 --> 46:37.560]  She did.
[46:37.680 --> 46:40.340]  She did a great job. Gracie is a true
[46:40.340 --> 46:42.020]  draftsman. She did a fantastic job.
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.260]  She definitely is.
[46:44.420 --> 46:45.880]  She picked those two dogs.
[46:46.160 --> 46:46.940]  She did a great job.
[46:47.440 --> 46:50.160]  We need to get that next round of drafts
[46:50.160 --> 46:50.800]  going, actually.
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.700]  It should be pretty soon. We should really get a lot
[46:54.240 --> 46:54.480]  happening.
[46:56.200 --> 46:57.540]  We got a lot coming out.
[46:57.660 --> 46:59.500]  And we have a lot coming out every week.
[46:59.760 --> 47:00.960]  Which I'm excited about.
[47:01.580 --> 47:02.580]  Maintain, maintain, maintain.
[47:02.840 --> 47:04.860]  I think this comes out Tuesday.
[47:05.060 --> 47:06.620]  What we're recording right now should be out Tuesday.
[47:07.080 --> 47:08.100]  I believe so, yeah.
[47:08.500 --> 47:09.840]  On our Regulation Gameplay channel.
[47:10.800 --> 47:11.980]  That is correct.
[47:11.980 --> 47:14.900]  If Nick decides he wants to edit it, he might just say no.
[47:16.440 --> 47:17.260]  You're all turned around.
[47:17.520 --> 47:17.760]  Oh no.
[47:18.400 --> 47:19.460]  I'm so turned around.
[47:21.020 --> 47:21.680]  Good pie.
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.100]  Good pie.
[47:25.640 --> 47:27.640]  I'm sick of these springs, man.
[47:27.900 --> 47:29.780]  I'm sick of getting put to sleep.
[47:30.860 --> 47:31.780]  We're putting this
[47:31.780 --> 47:32.980]  cat to fucking sleep.
[47:33.920 --> 47:35.840]  I hate this.
[47:36.600 --> 47:37.580]  Time get wrong.
[47:38.860 --> 47:39.460]  ODSD.
[47:39.680 --> 47:40.640]  Take that ODSD.
[47:41.820 --> 47:42.840]  Andrew's defending
[47:43.920 --> 47:45.120]  this cup right here.
[47:45.280 --> 47:46.780]  He wants this bad.
[47:47.300 --> 47:48.240]  I want it back.
[47:48.920 --> 47:50.480]  I want that burger.
[47:50.580 --> 47:52.540]  He wants in on this thing, dude.
[47:53.340 --> 47:53.860]  I'm surprised
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.200]  Halo and
[47:56.200 --> 47:58.180]  a Garfield fan like this guy
[47:58.180 --> 47:59.980]  wouldn't name himself ODSD.
[48:00.680 --> 48:01.060]  Oh!
[48:02.680 --> 48:04.700]  That's such... oh damn it, dude.
[48:05.760 --> 48:06.440]  That's just good.
[48:07.600 --> 48:08.380]  Seems like a missed
[48:08.380 --> 48:09.000]  opportunity.
[48:09.880 --> 48:11.540]  First place! Damn.
[48:11.840 --> 48:12.720]  Way to go.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.340]  I'm locking it in.
[48:17.660 --> 48:18.380]  We ain't making
[48:18.380 --> 48:19.420]  the same mistakes twice.
[48:24.410 --> 48:26.670]  Eric, check the clip I uploaded to the general channel
[48:26.670 --> 48:28.570]  on Discord. No, I'm okay. I'm doing this.
[48:31.950 --> 48:32.550]  Nah, I'm good.
[48:33.130 --> 48:34.150]  Yeah, I mean, I'm doing
[48:34.610 --> 48:35.730]  like I'm doing this right now.
[48:36.830 --> 48:37.750]  There you go.
[48:38.190 --> 48:40.350]  Now, Geoff, do you have the climb?
[48:40.610 --> 48:42.590]  You got fourth and now you're going to shoot for
[48:42.590 --> 48:42.890]  second?
[48:44.790 --> 48:46.510]  No, I'm going to try to regress
[48:46.510 --> 48:47.710]  back to fifth, if anything.
[48:48.170 --> 48:51.530]  Oh, the descent. Okay.
[48:51.810 --> 48:54.190]  Yeah, the maintain.
[48:54.350 --> 48:55.430]  It's the climb down.
[48:55.690 --> 48:58.630]  I overachieved that last one. I wasn't looking to do that.
[49:00.570 --> 49:01.490]  Oh, got that boost.
[49:01.750 --> 49:03.270]  Look at this.
[49:03.770 --> 49:05.030]  Look at him drift.
[49:06.290 --> 49:06.670]  Wow.
[49:09.130 --> 49:10.530]  Give this man
[49:10.530 --> 49:11.710]  his burger flowers.
[49:15.500 --> 49:16.860]  Anybody watch that Celtics
[49:16.860 --> 49:18.920]  game last night? Pretty good Celtics game last night.
[49:19.240 --> 49:20.160]  How are you feeling about that?
[49:20.580 --> 49:22.820]  Fucking amazing. I feel better than I do
[49:22.820 --> 49:24.680]  about this. I gotta stop hitting
[49:24.680 --> 49:26.400]  that god damn
[49:27.320 --> 49:27.760]  snowman.
[49:29.880 --> 49:30.760]  Every fucking
[49:31.840 --> 49:32.820]  race against him.
[49:32.900 --> 49:34.720]  And also, that fucking
[49:34.720 --> 49:36.900]  oh my god, I hate this cave.
[49:41.240 --> 49:42.580]  Anyway, Celtics are great.
[49:43.060 --> 49:45.020]  Yeah. Oh, if you guys want to see Geoff break shit,
[49:45.020 --> 49:46.940]  he's got a TikTok where he's opening cards
[49:46.940 --> 49:49.220]  every day. He's breaking open packs. Go check it out.
[49:49.600 --> 49:50.260]  Daily Rip.
[49:50.920 --> 49:52.300]  We'll figure out a break show.
[49:52.780 --> 49:54.460]  We'll do something soon.
[49:54.740 --> 49:56.760]  We just have to find time and a place.
[49:57.360 --> 49:58.840]  Yeah, we gotta figure out
[49:58.840 --> 50:00.680]  what the new normal is. I'm still trying to figure out
[50:00.680 --> 50:02.400]  my new rhythm to life in general.
[50:02.880 --> 50:03.640]  New normal.
[50:03.940 --> 50:06.360]  Yeah, it's been...
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.300]  Yeah, your new normal.
[50:09.040 --> 50:10.720]  Been a bit of an adjustment.
[50:10.720 --> 50:11.480]  Yep.
[50:12.760 --> 50:14.280]  Every day feels like a Monday.
[50:15.300 --> 50:16.060]  Oh, no.
[50:16.460 --> 50:18.280]  That's his least favorite one.
[50:19.100 --> 50:19.480]  Andrew!
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.600]  Fuck me. Sexy Mexa
[50:22.600 --> 50:24.420]  Man is in front of you now? What are you doing?
[50:24.840 --> 50:25.920]  Get your head in the game, dude.
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.120]  Getting a pie out there is what I'm doing.
[50:29.600 --> 50:30.560]  I'm definitely a bitch.
[50:30.560 --> 50:31.320]  Right there, boom.
[50:32.360 --> 50:34.040]  Bad, bad. You're gonna hit it.
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.020]  Oh my god.
[50:37.400 --> 50:38.500]  What are you doing?
[50:38.500 --> 50:39.380]  Oh my god.
[50:41.180 --> 50:43.080]  Okay, lock in, lock in, lock in.
[50:43.640 --> 50:44.560]  Looks like Geoff didn't
[50:44.560 --> 50:45.940]  fuck up for once that time.
[50:48.860 --> 50:50.200]  Oh, look at that turn.
[50:51.100 --> 50:52.080]  Andrew, come on.
[50:52.460 --> 50:53.800]  That's not ideal.
[50:57.410 --> 50:57.990]  Holy shit.
[50:58.010 --> 50:59.210]  What happened? Oh, no!
[51:00.070 --> 51:01.510]  You weren't even trying for that.
[51:06.060 --> 51:08.080]  Dude, it's the new chair. Andrew's too relaxed.
[51:08.240 --> 51:09.760]  Italian mafia guy is right.
[51:09.760 --> 51:11.480]  Told ya, man. Told ya.
[51:12.440 --> 51:14.180]  Italian mafia guy.
[51:15.580 --> 51:16.720]  I don't know nothing about that.
[51:16.880 --> 51:19.900]  That's such a fucking funny name to me.
[51:20.640 --> 51:21.900]  Name myself whatever I want.
[51:21.960 --> 51:23.860]  I'm Italian mafia guy.
[51:24.560 --> 51:25.500]  I thought I just thought of myself
[51:25.500 --> 51:27.520]  as a bit of an Italian mafia guy.
[51:31.580 --> 51:32.980]  Shit. Andrew!
[51:35.180 --> 51:37.160]  Oh my god, even Geoff?
[51:37.320 --> 51:38.940]  Oh my god. Oh, man.
[51:38.940 --> 51:40.820]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[51:40.980 --> 51:42.180]  I'm collapsing. Dude.
[51:42.920 --> 51:44.140]  Collapsing is what I'm doing.
[51:44.460 --> 51:46.560]  Non-cryptic moth says no shame in bronze.
[51:46.740 --> 51:47.940]  I don't know about that.
[51:49.460 --> 51:51.080]  Sounds like something somebody in bronze
[51:51.080 --> 51:51.720]  would say.
[51:52.880 --> 51:53.840]  So you?
[51:55.460 --> 51:56.180]  Ah, shit.
[51:57.900 --> 51:58.980]  You know, they say that
[51:58.980 --> 52:00.760]  bronze is the best medal to win
[52:00.760 --> 52:02.740]  psychologically. Is that right?
[52:03.580 --> 52:04.520]  Yeah, I really don't know.
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.300]  Well, that's good because Andrew's about to get it.
[52:07.140 --> 52:08.100]  Gold medal
[52:08.100 --> 52:09.480]  kind of sucks because
[52:10.060 --> 52:12.340]  once you've done it, you've like tested the mountain.
[52:12.580 --> 52:14.340]  You know, and then there's a lot of
[52:14.340 --> 52:15.920]  depression that goes with that.
[52:16.140 --> 52:17.120]  No, Geoff!
[52:18.020 --> 52:18.320]  No!
[52:19.860 --> 52:21.560]  Who left that pie?
[52:22.340 --> 52:23.520]  Who left the pie?
[52:25.640 --> 52:27.740]  And then silver medal.
[52:28.180 --> 52:30.320]  The silver medalists have the highest rate
[52:30.320 --> 52:32.300]  of suicide of all Olympian medals.
[52:33.360 --> 52:34.380]  Because they never
[52:34.380 --> 52:36.480]  quite got there, but they got fucking close.
[52:37.220 --> 52:38.320]  And then bronze medalists are
[52:38.320 --> 52:39.680]  just happy to be on the podium.
[52:40.320 --> 52:41.160]  Holy shit!
[52:41.680 --> 52:43.720]  So you finished first and fourth, Andrew?
[52:43.960 --> 52:45.000]  This is going to be crazy.
[52:45.360 --> 52:47.620]  Listen, I needed to do that to get a climb going.
[52:47.820 --> 52:49.980]  Because now we're climbing. We're back to the climb.
[52:50.180 --> 52:51.440]  I'm fucking everybody up.
[52:51.800 --> 52:52.880]  I'm hitting everyone.
[52:54.220 --> 52:55.700]  Yeah, but I'm bashing everybody.
[52:56.740 --> 52:58.140]  I'm asserting dominance.
[52:59.740 --> 53:00.460]  Harry's showing
[53:00.460 --> 53:01.060]  who's who.
[53:01.680 --> 53:03.000]  This is Harry's world.
[53:03.120 --> 53:04.600]  He's fucking driving in it.
[53:04.660 --> 53:06.060]  You have not picked up an item.
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.780]  I've been trying to as well,
[53:08.900 --> 53:09.680]  which makes it even worse.
[53:10.640 --> 53:12.960]  It sucks to be in the back. That's where I usually live.
[53:13.160 --> 53:14.640]  Hard to get items back there.
[53:15.440 --> 53:16.140]  Lasagna time, baby.
[53:16.920 --> 53:18.620]  Wait until you're after this bend.
[53:19.160 --> 53:19.480]  Save it.
[53:20.620 --> 53:22.420]  No one's going to drift. You hit it hard.
[53:23.500 --> 53:24.560]  Wrong way, baby.
[53:24.840 --> 53:25.640]  Bad turn.
[53:27.280 --> 53:29.100]  Just trade and paint with the wall, bud.
[53:30.660 --> 53:31.780]  Into the water!
[53:32.680 --> 53:33.480]  Into the water!
[53:35.420 --> 53:36.620]  I double-watered
[53:36.620 --> 53:37.580]  I was going so fast.
[53:37.640 --> 53:38.760]  That was crazy.
[53:39.840 --> 53:41.780]  It's always going to be an uphill battle, man.
[53:44.340 --> 53:45.480]  Oh, CM Rooney
[53:45.480 --> 53:47.060]  taking the bullet for you.
[53:50.980 --> 53:51.800]  Alright, here we go.
[53:51.900 --> 53:53.180]  Now we're on the move, right here.
[53:53.220 --> 53:54.300]  Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[53:55.560 --> 53:57.780]  If you get first... Andrew,
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.880]  if you get the gold, I'll say it right now,
[53:59.880 --> 54:01.740]  on Hamburger Cup, everyone here has to
[54:01.740 --> 54:02.660]  go see the Garfield movie.
[54:03.900 --> 54:05.300]  No way. I think that's a law.
[54:05.540 --> 54:06.740]  I think that's mandatory.
[54:08.680 --> 54:10.000]  That doesn't sound safe.
[54:13.160 --> 54:14.620]  Oh, look at ODST!
[54:16.180 --> 54:16.700]  No!
[54:17.440 --> 54:18.400]  You idiot.
[54:19.100 --> 54:19.700]  Do it again.
[54:21.520 --> 54:23.120]  Ireland's called taking a bath.
[54:23.960 --> 54:24.960]  Drop it right there, now.
[54:25.140 --> 54:26.480]  Geoff in first place.
[54:26.480 --> 54:28.240]  Oh, the pie!
[54:29.260 --> 54:29.980]  You pie.
[54:30.520 --> 54:32.360]  Mind your own fucking business, alright?
[54:34.380 --> 54:34.940]  Andrew!
[54:36.040 --> 54:37.420]  Yeah, I adjusted.
[54:38.860 --> 54:39.100]  Now.
[54:44.920 --> 54:46.220]  He's getting out of control.
[54:47.120 --> 54:48.040]  Oh, he got him!
[54:48.980 --> 54:51.420]  That's the first place I like to see, baby.
[54:51.720 --> 54:52.160]  That was good.
[54:52.180 --> 54:53.420]  It's the climb!
[54:54.040 --> 54:56.260]  You got one more lap, you just gotta hang tough.
[54:57.900 --> 54:59.080]  Oh, you went to sleep!
[54:59.080 --> 55:00.940]  That was the worst time
[55:00.940 --> 55:01.760]  for that to happen.
[55:01.980 --> 55:03.380]  Almost right into that water.
[55:04.580 --> 55:05.880]  I thought they were gonna kill me.
[55:07.060 --> 55:08.380]  You got this right here.
[55:08.840 --> 55:09.540]  Oh, no!
[55:11.200 --> 55:13.160]  Dude, it has been nap time for you.
[55:14.800 --> 55:16.140]  It's tough in the front.
[55:16.820 --> 55:18.060]  Everything goes forward.
[55:18.320 --> 55:19.260]  Oh, my God.
[55:19.720 --> 55:21.940]  Hitting the nap time boost.
[55:24.780 --> 55:25.680]  There you go.
[55:26.460 --> 55:27.420]  Every time.
[55:27.800 --> 55:28.560]  Every time.
[55:29.060 --> 55:30.820]  They're just putting you to sleep.
[55:30.940 --> 55:31.760]  It's brutal.
[55:34.460 --> 55:35.620]  The whole pack
[55:35.620 --> 55:36.480]  is behind you, too.
[55:36.740 --> 55:39.020]  There's distance, there's definitely distance.
[55:39.580 --> 55:40.140]  But, boy.
[55:40.520 --> 55:42.820]  You hit a bad nap time, you're toast, dude.
[55:44.640 --> 55:45.580]  Oh, I ain't hitting
[55:45.580 --> 55:46.220]  no bad naps.
[55:47.460 --> 55:48.460]  Oh, shit!
[55:48.460 --> 55:50.280]  My sleep game is on point!
[55:51.080 --> 55:52.280]  You're doing good so far.
[55:52.280 --> 55:53.740]  No! What was that?
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.080]  Odie is right behind you.
[55:56.120 --> 55:57.300]  I don't like how close Odie's getting.
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.460]  Get away, Odie!
[56:01.160 --> 56:02.500]  Andrew, you have
[56:02.500 --> 56:03.820]  to place in this next one.
[56:04.120 --> 56:06.040]  I would assume you have to be first or second
[56:06.040 --> 56:07.700]  in this next one if you want to take home
[56:07.700 --> 56:08.980]  the hamburger cup.
[56:09.180 --> 56:11.040]  I'm locking up this hamburger cup.
[56:11.980 --> 56:13.460]  We're locking this up.
[56:14.560 --> 56:15.480]  Getting intense.
[56:15.480 --> 56:17.680]  Mm-hmm.
[56:19.700 --> 56:21.240]  Bam! Oh, good job, Geoff!
[56:21.340 --> 56:22.140]  Thank you.
[56:24.540 --> 56:25.420]  I got
[56:25.420 --> 56:27.060]  six points up on Pregnant Apple
[56:27.060 --> 56:28.340]  and 12 on Geoff.
[56:29.440 --> 56:31.580]  Pregnant Apple is the... I gotta watch out for them.
[56:32.000 --> 56:33.580]  Oh, boy. Alright, it's time here.
[56:34.080 --> 56:34.300]  Okay.
[56:35.260 --> 56:36.360]  Geoff, you think you got first?
[56:36.420 --> 56:39.060]  You think you fucking got what it takes to be first here?
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.800]  I'm going for fifth.
[56:41.600 --> 56:41.940]  Pfft.
[56:41.940 --> 56:44.120]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[56:45.180 --> 56:45.980]  Fuck, I missed
[56:45.980 --> 56:47.820]  the boost. Oh, Apple didn't.
[56:48.100 --> 56:48.240]  Shit.
[56:49.920 --> 56:50.860]  Look at him go.
[56:54.050 --> 56:55.350]  There you go. Look at that
[56:55.350 --> 56:56.650]  turn. No! Whoa!
[56:57.090 --> 56:57.830]  Pregnant Apple!
[56:58.810 --> 57:00.070]  What a move!
[57:00.490 --> 57:01.170]  Oh, no.
[57:02.690 --> 57:03.770]  Poor CM Rooney.
[57:07.020 --> 57:08.940]  Big turn. Cut back the other way.
[57:09.020 --> 57:10.340]  Easy, easy. Inside edge.
[57:10.920 --> 57:12.120]  Dude, what the fuck?
[57:12.120 --> 57:13.640]  Everyone is on top of each other.
[57:13.680 --> 57:14.300]  Yeah, this is tough.
[57:17.020 --> 57:18.020]  You better not
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.900]  fucking fall in. Oh, Andrew, if you
[57:19.900 --> 57:21.740]  fall in, oh, my God, I'm gonna flip.
[57:21.800 --> 57:24.180]  I can't. I'm getting hit by stuff
[57:24.180 --> 57:26.100]  every second. Oh, my God.
[57:26.200 --> 57:27.840]  You're in eighth? Dead last.
[57:27.980 --> 57:29.820]  Oh, my God. It's the climb.
[57:29.820 --> 57:31.940]  What better climb can you get than going from
[57:31.940 --> 57:33.860]  eighth to first? It's the fucking climb.
[57:33.860 --> 57:35.200]  It's the climb!
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.440]  Oh, they've activated it.
[57:38.340 --> 57:39.920]  Hit him, put him to sleep. Do it.
[57:39.920 --> 57:41.780]  Now. I'm waiting.
[57:41.940 --> 57:44.000]  No, I gotta aim this one. Oh, you're crazy.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  I gotta aim it. Oh, my
[57:46.000 --> 57:46.680]  God, you're crazy.
[57:49.280 --> 57:50.040]  Oh, this
[57:50.040 --> 57:50.680]  is Andrew.
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.840]  Yeah. Okay.
[57:54.160 --> 57:55.900]  Night-night. Oh, man,
[57:55.940 --> 57:57.440]  that sucked. See?
[57:57.680 --> 57:59.820]  That could not have been worse timing for me.
[57:59.820 --> 58:00.560]  That's what I'm talking about.
[58:01.020 --> 58:04.120]  Oh! Everyone is just beating
[58:04.120 --> 58:04.660]  me up.
[58:07.500 --> 58:07.800]  Andrew
[58:07.800 --> 58:09.540]  is getting clotheslined
[58:09.540 --> 58:11.840]  out here. Just blasted.
[58:11.920 --> 58:13.780]  Oh, come on. I was within a dick
[58:13.780 --> 58:15.640]  hair of first place in that third.
[58:15.740 --> 58:17.640]  Geoff is just up there. We see him.
[58:17.940 --> 58:19.340]  Don't! Oh, don't fall in.
[58:19.780 --> 58:20.820]  Hit him with it. Fuck.
[58:21.320 --> 58:21.740]  No!
[58:24.520 --> 58:25.040]  Andrew.
[58:26.420 --> 58:27.180]  I got
[58:27.180 --> 58:28.400]  bounced by somebody.
[58:29.100 --> 58:31.000]  No item on that pole, too.
[58:31.680 --> 58:32.340]  Oh, my God.
[58:33.780 --> 58:34.300]  Dude.
[58:35.040 --> 58:36.080]  Oh, it's the pie.
[58:36.920 --> 58:38.480]  Oh, I barely
[58:38.480 --> 58:39.160]  hit it.
[58:42.550 --> 58:43.430]  Okay. Now.
[58:44.770 --> 58:46.030]  Okay. Yep, there you go.
[58:46.230 --> 58:48.210]  You just cut through. Just grab and cut
[58:48.210 --> 58:49.230]  through. Get him out of here.
[58:49.870 --> 58:50.510]  Oh, what?
[58:52.410 --> 58:53.290]  Fucking tomato.
[58:54.610 --> 58:55.530]  God damn it.
[58:56.710 --> 58:58.250]  I've been hit by 50 pies
[58:58.250 --> 59:00.430]  this round. Busted out, dude.
[59:00.470 --> 59:02.390]  Didn't even grab the item. Hit the pie.
[59:02.450 --> 59:03.530]  Oh, my God.
[59:03.530 --> 59:05.310]  Andrew, Andrew. I just gotta say it.
[59:05.350 --> 59:06.490]  I don't think you want it bad enough.
[59:06.970 --> 59:08.430]  I don't think you want it bad enough.
[59:09.490 --> 59:11.370]  I don't think you want it.
[59:13.730 --> 59:14.210]  Sixth place.
[59:14.930 --> 59:16.530]  I don't think you want the hamburger cup.
[59:16.890 --> 59:18.110]  I just don't think you want the hamburger cup.
[59:19.810 --> 59:21.130]  Give me the burger.
[59:21.370 --> 59:23.290]  There's third. Right in the drink
[59:23.690 --> 59:24.090]  again.
[59:26.030 --> 59:27.850]  Again. Geoff is in front of you.
[59:28.070 --> 59:29.410]  Oh, Geoff. Oh, the pie.
[59:29.770 --> 59:30.470]  Geoff.
[59:33.610 --> 59:34.970]  The spring.
[59:36.470 --> 59:37.830]  Third place.
[59:38.210 --> 59:39.650]  You have to podium here.
[59:39.970 --> 59:41.010]  You have to.
[59:41.390 --> 59:42.190]  Oh, no.
[59:43.230 --> 59:43.490]  No.
[59:44.730 --> 59:47.350]  Fifth. I was in second
[59:47.350 --> 59:48.850]  for almost the whole time.
[59:49.390 --> 59:51.590]  Andrew did not want it.
[59:51.750 --> 59:53.270]  Andrew does not. Let's see.
[59:53.630 --> 59:54.970]  Where does he place? Oh, no.
[59:55.070 --> 59:56.070]  Got me.
[59:57.070 --> 59:58.050]  Let's see.
[59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.430]  Only four points on the last race.
[01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:01.950]  Second place.
[01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:05.830]  Geoff in third.
[01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.290]  Congratulations, Geoff.
[01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:10.430]  I heard good things about the bronze medal, dude.
[01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:12.430]  We tend to be the
[01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.090]  happiest. Andrew, things are
[01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.530]  looking pretty dark for your near future.
[01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.050]  That is
[01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.290]  bleak, bud.
[01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:21.490]  A burger?
[01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:24.970]  Andrew, what happened?
[01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.370]  Far away from a burger, man.
[01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.470]  There were too many pies.
[01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:31.310]  I choked. I mean, that was on me.
[01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.170]  You fell apart.
[01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:34.630]  I fell apart at the end.
[01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.130]  I lost my footing and I was climbing
[01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.210]  and then I fell down the mountain.
[01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.110]  Dude, I don't know.
[01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:42.290]  That was ugly.
[01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.750]  Hit every rock on the way down.
[01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:44.810]  Terrible.
[01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.290]  That was awful.
[01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.810]  Oh, man.
[01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.770]  You like that scene in Hot Rod?
[01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:53.450]  Take it through.
[01:00:53.790 --> 01:00:54.970]  Wait, are you stuck here?
[01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.230]  I think I'm stuck here.
[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:59.810]  Do we want to make that the last race anyway?
[01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.690]  I think that might be the best place
[01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:02.530]  to end, don't you?
[01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:05.150]  Wow.
[01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:07.970]  Guys, I'll go back
[01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.890]  to the logo here so we can sign off.
[01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.490]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:13.850]  This has been a great stream.
[01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:16.290]  Geoff, Andrew, anything you guys want to say?
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:18.930]  Don't forget to tailsync, Geoff.
[01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:19.830]  Alright, there you go.
[01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.970]  I just had a real blast.
[01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:24.310]  Thanks for hanging out with us for this last hour and a half or so.
[01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:26.850]  Thanks for being patient through the technical difficulties.
[01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:28.230]  I would say that
[01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:30.470]  you shouldn't expect that to happen in the future,
[01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:31.810]  but you should, and it will.
[01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:34.510]  It would be more of a get used to it kind of a thing,
[01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:34.990]  I think.
[01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:38.390]  Looking forward to playing video games with you next week, too.
[01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:40.570]  That's all.
[01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.730]  That was very nice, Geoff.
[01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:44.510]  I thought
[01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:48.010]  maybe you were going to say something else.
[01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:49.650]  No, I said
[01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:51.210]  don't forget to tailsync, Geoff.
[01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.790]  Also, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:55.170]  I'm not logged in as
[01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:57.610]  this show, so I'm trying to raid Ray
[01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:58.250]  and it's not working.
[01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:00.150]  Anyway, you do it.
[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.990]  Guys, I appreciate it.
[01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.590]  Hit backslash raid and then hit Ray.
[01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.750]  I'm just not logged in.
[01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:09.570]  Anyway, guys, thank you so much.
[01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:10.230]  We'll see you soon.
[01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:11.390]  Patreon.com
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.790]  slash 100% EAT
[01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.470]  is where you can see a different show.
[01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.030]  No, the regulation pod.
[01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:19.590]  Shut the fuck up there.
[01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:21.910]  I got confused. I was in work mode
[01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:23.370]  and I was thinking about one or the other
[01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:24.950]  and I couldn't remember.
[01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:26.790]  There you go.
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.550]  We'll see you guys next time.
[01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:31.310]  Bye!
