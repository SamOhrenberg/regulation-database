[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  Did you have to kind of communicate with us here at this point, I think, Gavin?
[00:03.880 --> 00:04.860]  Oh yeah, I pressed it.
[00:07.440 --> 00:10.320]  He's live. I'm looking at it.
[00:11.400 --> 00:16.220]  Yeah, you hit it. You hit the button and then it worked.
[00:17.540 --> 00:18.400]  Oh, shit.
[00:19.380 --> 00:20.220]  Crazy duck man.
[00:20.320 --> 00:24.320]  I do. I do see it. It says it says Gavin attempts no point in dying in limbo.
[00:24.440 --> 00:25.140]  Is that what we're doing?
[00:26.420 --> 00:27.140]  That's what we're doing.
[00:27.140 --> 00:30.460]  Gavin's trying to work towards an achievement that he's not going to get today.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.520]  I think here's the thing. Here's the thing. The baseball season just started.
[00:37.080 --> 00:41.700]  And I just saw the Padres just lost to the Cubs. It's a heartbreaker,
[00:41.920 --> 00:44.420]  but it's the first loss. It's the first loss of the season.
[00:44.880 --> 00:47.880]  They got so deep into the season before losing their first game.
[00:48.060 --> 00:52.240]  And you know why that is? Because of practice. Because of commitment to greatness.
[00:52.500 --> 00:55.560]  And I think that's what we have to do here is there has to be a commitment to greatness.
[00:55.560 --> 00:59.320]  And Gavin, I think it's time for you to commit and get some practice in
[00:59.320 --> 01:03.780]  before really diving in and figuring out how to do no point in dying in limbo.
[01:03.860 --> 01:04.660]  How do you feel about that?
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.660]  Shall I genuinely restart every time I hit five deaths?
[01:09.740 --> 01:12.640]  That's up to you. I think I think maybe, you know,
[01:12.700 --> 01:15.220]  if like you're starting to get a little deeper and you need to see.
[01:15.520 --> 01:18.840]  But then, you know, but at the same time, you know, let's give it a shot.
[01:18.960 --> 01:20.220]  Let's see what happens. All right.
[01:20.260 --> 01:23.740]  Maybe the first after after the first five deaths, maybe you restart and we see what happens.
[01:24.300 --> 01:27.340]  OK, well, let's get a wall of piss rats and then I'll get going.
[01:27.440 --> 01:30.640]  No, no, we want corn cats. We don't want piss rats.
[01:30.760 --> 01:35.780]  Just corn cats. CrazyDuckMain3 knows what's the corn cats in there.
[01:36.340 --> 01:39.280]  CrazyDuckMain, it means me and CrazyDuckMain, the only ones doing corn cats.
[01:39.840 --> 01:43.660]  Look at all those rats of his piss. Press any button.
[01:44.340 --> 01:46.100]  OK. Presume.
[01:46.940 --> 01:49.700]  Presume. Presume.
[01:49.860 --> 01:50.800]  Did I never beat this game?
[01:50.800 --> 01:53.600]  Where are my achievements?
[01:54.220 --> 01:57.740]  Yeah, I like that you only missing this one.
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.280]  OK. Oh, my God.
[01:59.820 --> 02:01.840]  Wow. When did I get the others?
[02:04.200 --> 02:05.120]  There you go.
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.840]  Wow. Almost, dude, almost 10 years to the day.
[02:11.020 --> 02:15.340]  Dude, I played this almost exactly 10 years ago.
[02:15.460 --> 02:16.940]  What an idiot man for trying this.
[02:17.100 --> 02:17.600]  Here we go.
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.420]  So crazy.
[02:18.820 --> 02:23.240]  Let's see if this memory pays off a decade later.
[02:23.520 --> 02:24.900]  Can I blind run it?
[02:25.500 --> 02:26.380]  This is awesome.
[02:26.720 --> 02:29.460]  I will say this is the first time I'm seeing the game Limbo.
[02:29.980 --> 02:30.240]  OK.
[02:30.600 --> 02:31.160]  That's great.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.840]  Yeah. Is your mouse supposed to be on the screen?
[02:34.000 --> 02:34.560]  Like, that's good.
[02:35.020 --> 02:35.480]  Oh, sorry.
[02:37.640 --> 02:38.500]  Is it still on the screen?
[02:38.980 --> 02:39.580]  There you go.
[02:40.800 --> 02:43.060]  I know it's like your first time streaming, but man, come on.
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.260]  Oh, yeah. I've never streamed a video game yet, I don't think.
[02:47.260 --> 02:48.660]  Aside from on my phone.
[02:49.260 --> 02:50.700]  Just pinball and my phone.
[02:53.060 --> 02:54.800]  OK, so let's keep count of deaths.
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.560]  If you just joined, you're watching me play Limbo.
[02:58.800 --> 02:59.480]  The others are just...
[03:01.340 --> 03:01.740]  OK.
[03:05.480 --> 03:06.480]  OK, good one.
[03:06.740 --> 03:07.800]  Is there a...
[03:07.800 --> 03:08.200]  Good jump.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.580]  See, that was that. Could it kill me?
[03:09.720 --> 03:10.940]  Is there a sprint or am I just...
[03:11.660 --> 03:12.560]  I don't think so.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.380]  Start hitting buttons.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.620]  OK, so let's grab this.
[03:15.960 --> 03:17.000]  That looks like I should grab.
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.020]  Let's grab this.
[03:19.180 --> 03:19.660]  Oh, this is...
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.880]  Was this an Xbox 360 game?
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.540]  I believe it was.
[03:24.180 --> 03:25.000]  It looks...
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.120]  It looks like it.
[03:26.700 --> 03:27.600]  I played it.
[03:27.700 --> 03:30.480]  I clearly must have played on the Xbox One if I played a decade ago.
[03:30.520 --> 03:31.440]  It's much older than that.
[03:32.360 --> 03:33.280]  Oh, Gavin.
[03:34.680 --> 03:35.540]  Oh, Gavin.
[03:35.920 --> 03:36.700]  Oh, boy.
[03:37.960 --> 03:39.440]  OK, this is...
[03:39.440 --> 03:39.580]  Oh, boy.
[03:40.460 --> 03:42.300]  Am I just doing a big old jump here again?
[03:42.620 --> 03:43.520]  It looks like it.
[03:43.820 --> 03:44.640]  Go for it.
[03:45.320 --> 03:45.760]  There you go.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.060]  There you go.
[03:46.320 --> 03:46.840]  It's a good jump.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.480]  Uh, chat, if you guys can keep track of deaths, that would help us out.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.580]  So far, we're at zero.
[03:53.060 --> 03:55.520]  There is a poll in the chat right now.
[03:55.620 --> 03:57.800]  Will there be a death in this stream?
[03:58.320 --> 03:59.460]  Will there be a death?
[03:59.860 --> 04:00.740]  You're going to laugh.
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.100]  Oh, 10 people.
[04:02.180 --> 04:03.400]  10 people have said no.
[04:03.680 --> 04:04.760]  No, he's going to get it.
[04:04.980 --> 04:09.500]  Just going to really remember back to 2015.
[04:09.720 --> 04:11.300]  What was going on in 2015?
[04:13.300 --> 04:14.820]  ShammyYT just gifted five subs.
[04:14.900 --> 04:16.140]  Does that help you jog your memory?
[04:16.340 --> 04:16.880]  It does.
[04:16.880 --> 04:17.680]  That's helping me.
[04:17.720 --> 04:18.600]  Oh, yes.
[04:19.440 --> 04:21.580]  I'm remembering what happens after this boat.
[04:22.200 --> 04:22.720]  OK.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.620]  I'm just about to remember.
[04:25.880 --> 04:28.520]  Schindler's Fist just donated five subs.
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.080]  I'm very familiar with Schindler's Fist.
[04:31.240 --> 04:32.180]  Love Schindler's Fist.
[04:32.300 --> 04:33.120]  Thanks for stopping by.
[04:33.220 --> 04:33.840]  Thanks for the subs.
[04:34.960 --> 04:35.380]  OK.
[04:35.920 --> 04:36.680]  Well, this is going all right.
[04:36.720 --> 04:36.920]  OK.
[04:37.920 --> 04:38.480]  You're doing great.
[04:38.600 --> 04:38.840]  OK.
[04:38.920 --> 04:42.220]  You got to go Donkey Kong mode.
[04:42.300 --> 04:43.480]  Just break that wall down.
[04:43.640 --> 04:44.580]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[04:45.080 --> 04:45.940]  Before this started,
[04:46.100 --> 04:48.320]  me and Andrew were talking about how excited we are for new Donkey Kong.
[04:48.400 --> 04:49.360]  Oh, it's going to be so good.
[04:49.680 --> 04:49.920]  Yeah.
[04:50.600 --> 04:51.240]  Oh, what's it called?
[04:51.360 --> 04:53.720]  Like Bananamonium or something?
[04:53.900 --> 04:54.200]  What's it called?
[04:55.260 --> 04:55.620]  Bonanza?
[04:56.060 --> 04:56.800]  Bonanza, that was it.
[04:56.880 --> 04:57.460]  Yeah, it's Bonanza.
[04:57.720 --> 04:57.880]  Yeah.
[04:58.600 --> 05:00.320]  It's like bananas, like Bonanza.
[05:01.360 --> 05:03.680]  Is it more like a Mario type of game
[05:03.680 --> 05:06.080]  or is it more like a Donkey Kong 64 type of game?
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.780]  No, it's like Mario.
[05:07.860 --> 05:10.540]  It looks like they started developing a new Mario Odyssey
[05:10.540 --> 05:12.160]  and then went, this should be better for Donkey Kong.
[05:12.160 --> 05:14.720]  Oh, that looks like a dangerous spike.
[05:16.320 --> 05:18.680]  MK Nude Strip 10 gifted.
[05:18.920 --> 05:19.360]  Boom, baby.
[05:19.780 --> 05:20.900]  Wow, thank you.
[05:21.200 --> 05:21.940]  What am I doing?
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.000]  Can I turn around?
[05:24.620 --> 05:25.460]  Oh, shit.
[05:25.580 --> 05:26.160]  There you go.
[05:26.240 --> 05:26.800]  There you go.
[05:27.220 --> 05:28.340]  Hey, figuring it out.
[05:28.540 --> 05:28.960]  Look at you.
[05:28.980 --> 05:30.300]  You're flying through this.
[05:32.380 --> 05:34.360]  People are saying, can't wait to pay $80 for it.
[05:34.380 --> 05:35.560]  You can't even get it in the United States.
[05:35.560 --> 05:37.500]  So I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
[05:39.980 --> 05:42.680]  Actually, I have some price point issues here.
[05:42.820 --> 05:44.360]  You can't buy it here, dude.
[05:44.520 --> 05:46.360]  Is it for pre-order in other places already?
[05:47.340 --> 05:50.580]  Uh, I think, I think, I think the pre-orders are going to start soon.
[05:50.800 --> 05:51.700]  You can grab that.
[05:51.900 --> 05:52.620]  Oh, that's scary.
[05:52.900 --> 05:55.880]  It's April 8th for everywhere but the US.
[05:56.220 --> 05:56.420]  Yep.
[05:58.920 --> 06:01.000]  Why would you, why would you be afraid of this?
[06:01.020 --> 06:01.520]  You're not a bear.
[06:02.760 --> 06:03.160]  Okay.
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.080]  It's not for you.
[06:04.620 --> 06:04.880]  Yeah.
[06:05.740 --> 06:07.940]  Dude, if you find a people trap, be...
[06:08.420 --> 06:08.700]  Oh, shit.
[06:10.700 --> 06:11.560]  Oh, you're left foot.
[06:11.680 --> 06:13.100]  Thanks for the five gifted.
[06:13.200 --> 06:14.000]  Five gifted.
[06:14.180 --> 06:14.960]  Thank you so much.
[06:15.100 --> 06:15.680]  What is this?
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.460]  It's going to...
[06:16.920 --> 06:17.440]  What is this?
[06:17.780 --> 06:20.360]  It looks like a decaying body of some kind.
[06:20.760 --> 06:20.940]  Yep.
[06:21.200 --> 06:22.320]  Oh, my God.
[06:22.500 --> 06:22.900]  Whoa.
[06:24.160 --> 06:26.300]  Cranium overload with 20 gifted subs.
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.640]  You just overloaded my cranium.
[06:27.780 --> 06:28.520]  Cranium overload.
[06:28.620 --> 06:29.200]  Thanks for that.
[06:30.780 --> 06:33.040]  We played a game today that had some cranium overload.
[06:33.460 --> 06:33.920]  Oh, no.
[06:33.920 --> 06:34.860]  What just happened?
[06:36.220 --> 06:37.400]  I don't know. You jumped on and jumped off.
[06:39.360 --> 06:41.020]  Oh, you're getting all in the guts.
[06:41.340 --> 06:41.440]  Yeah.
[06:41.460 --> 06:44.180]  I guess I need to bear trap this.
[06:45.280 --> 06:46.480]  Yeah, that's got to be it.
[06:46.660 --> 06:47.920]  I guess it's a bear carcass.
[06:48.880 --> 06:50.640]  It's a lump of bear.
[06:50.640 --> 06:51.680]  You hang a bear like that?
[06:51.680 --> 06:52.420]  I don't know if you do that.
[06:52.600 --> 06:53.200]  I guess so.
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.300]  I mean, if bear trap were...
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.000]  Yeah, I guess it's bear.
[06:56.520 --> 06:57.280]  Oh, Gavin.
[06:57.660 --> 06:58.600]  Oh, no.
[06:59.640 --> 07:00.340]  That's not a deer.
[07:04.540 --> 07:08.320]  Oh, this is gonna be so much fun watching you try to do this without dying five times.
[07:09.500 --> 07:10.780]  There you go. You're doing great.
[07:11.980 --> 07:12.940]  Does it look like I'm playing?
[07:13.020 --> 07:15.660]  Like, you can't tell I'm just playing a YouTube video of someone else beating this?
[07:19.280 --> 07:22.820]  You've been doing a great job kind of keeping up with the noises of the video.
[07:22.900 --> 07:23.900]  So I think you're great.
[07:24.100 --> 07:28.120]  Now I'm gonna have to, I assume, start sliding and then jump at some point here.
[07:29.600 --> 07:30.660]  Oh, no. It's not steep enough.
[07:31.520 --> 07:31.940]  No, you're good.
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.180]  When does that spider get involved?
[07:33.180 --> 07:34.580]  I do remember the spider.
[07:35.640 --> 07:37.600]  It's the only thing I know about this.
[07:40.550 --> 07:43.250]  Oh, a Mega64 video where we had to make a spider.
[07:44.450 --> 07:45.110]  This is...
[07:45.950 --> 07:46.830]  Chrysosaurus5gifted, thank you.
[07:48.050 --> 07:49.150]  I'm so scared.
[07:50.190 --> 07:50.930]  There you go.
[07:51.010 --> 07:53.410]  Oh, oh, oh, you sensed that.
[07:53.490 --> 07:54.790]  You handled that really well.
[07:54.910 --> 07:55.790]  Oh, you knew about that.
[07:55.850 --> 07:57.750]  They foreshadowed it with the little rolly balls.
[08:04.280 --> 08:08.040]  Okay, I'm pretty uneasy at this point.
[08:08.320 --> 08:09.440]  Wow, you're doing great.
[08:10.740 --> 08:11.220]  There's...
[08:11.640 --> 08:13.380]  Lots of four-round gubs.
[08:14.960 --> 08:16.840]  Did... did you guys play this at Achievement Hunter?
[08:16.980 --> 08:17.980]  Is this like an Achievement Hunter game?
[08:18.820 --> 08:21.760]  You think we all got together and played one-player limbo?
[08:22.260 --> 08:23.220]  I don't know.
[08:23.320 --> 08:25.040]  I don't know how Achievement Hunter really worked.
[08:25.160 --> 08:25.920]  I didn't watch it.
[08:27.400 --> 08:29.480]  Well, I clearly never hunted this Achievement Hunter yet.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.680]  I'm doing it now.
[08:33.400 --> 08:34.100]  There you go.
[08:34.960 --> 08:35.400]  ReliantB10gifted.
[08:35.820 --> 08:39.160]  Do you ever print out an achievement hanging on your wall like a hunter?
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.100]  Like really get into the hunter lifestyle?
[08:45.160 --> 08:47.100]  Make like a vest out of an achievement.
[08:47.960 --> 08:49.320]  Like Craven the Hunter.
[08:53.000 --> 08:53.440]  GorpinYom5gifted.
[08:53.580 --> 08:55.380]  Oh, you're screwing him back.
[08:55.540 --> 08:56.060]  It's pretty good.
[08:56.220 --> 08:56.940]  5gifted, thank you.
[08:57.160 --> 08:57.600]  No!
[08:58.700 --> 08:59.540]  Okay, one death.
[09:01.340 --> 09:01.900]  There's one.
[09:02.380 --> 09:05.240]  That is unfortunate because that didn't look very deep.
[09:05.800 --> 09:06.840]  I feel like I could have got out of that.
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.080]  Yeah, I agree.
[09:10.060 --> 09:11.420]  Am I a moron?
[09:11.520 --> 09:11.960]  What am I doing?
[09:13.100 --> 09:13.820]  I don't know.
[09:13.880 --> 09:14.440]  What are you doing?
[09:15.400 --> 09:16.500]  Do I need to do something different?
[09:17.520 --> 09:18.000]  I don't know.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.640]  I might be too thick for this game.
[09:22.580 --> 09:24.480]  I thought I was going to ride it over, but it's...
[09:25.440 --> 09:25.960]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[09:26.040 --> 09:26.640]  You're riding it.
[09:26.640 --> 09:27.300]  Shit!
[09:28.320 --> 09:28.840]  What's happening?
[09:28.920 --> 09:29.940]  The damn thing sinks!
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.580]  Well, yeah.
[09:31.660 --> 09:32.920]  Well, yeah, you were on it, right?
[09:33.620 --> 09:34.560]  Can I just hold it?
[09:36.700 --> 09:37.460]  Wouldn't it sink?
[09:41.160 --> 09:44.420]  Somebody in the chat said this part took me so damn long when I was a kid.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.200]  So if I just push...
[09:51.880 --> 09:52.800]  No, I'm going under.
[09:52.940 --> 09:53.480]  I'm going under!
[09:55.260 --> 09:56.540]  What are you supposed to do?
[09:57.260 --> 09:58.280]  Is there something?
[09:59.240 --> 09:59.940]  Is there a thing?
[10:00.120 --> 10:00.700]  Do I need to get that?
[10:01.600 --> 10:02.720]  Do I need to use the box first?
[10:02.900 --> 10:03.080]  I don't know.
[10:03.120 --> 10:03.740]  Is there like a string?
[10:04.500 --> 10:05.440]  Oh, okay.
[10:07.020 --> 10:08.180]  10 years is a long time.
[10:09.240 --> 10:10.280]  Yeah, I mean, I agree.
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.200]  I feel like if you got stuck in this game, you could ask Meg and she would tell you what to do.
[10:20.340 --> 10:23.900]  Like, I don't know if that's true, like if that's real or not.
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.260]  It just feels right to me.
[10:27.280 --> 10:27.640]  Whee!
[10:29.920 --> 10:30.940]  Oh, nice, way to go.
[10:31.260 --> 10:32.360]  I think you figured it out.
[10:32.820 --> 10:33.800]  Well, you cracked the code there, bud.
[10:35.520 --> 10:36.260]  Oh, dear.
[10:38.800 --> 10:40.880]  I feel like I jumped a little bit early there.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.480]  That was not ideal.
[10:43.100 --> 10:43.820]  But you made it.
[10:43.880 --> 10:44.120]  You're good.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.140]  Ah, this is what we need.
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.260]  This is what we need, son.
[10:48.880 --> 10:49.820]  Oh, I see.
[10:50.320 --> 10:51.640]  Probably best not to follow that down.
[10:51.800 --> 10:51.900]  Oh, yeah.
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.220]  I was going to say it's trying to trick you into jumping down.
[10:56.220 --> 10:57.220]  You should not do that.
[10:58.860 --> 11:00.480]  Whoa, that was cool.
[11:01.580 --> 11:02.060]  Parkour!
[11:03.760 --> 11:04.580]  Oh, shit!
[11:08.020 --> 11:09.420]  Can I just run?
[11:10.100 --> 11:11.340]  Okay, okay, all right.
[11:11.360 --> 11:11.880]  Oh, you made it.
[11:11.920 --> 11:12.080]  Cool.
[11:12.620 --> 11:14.740]  Nathaniel Daney, 5gifted, thank you very much.
[11:14.860 --> 11:21.220]  Appreciate everyone sticking with us on this out of the ordinary sort of Friday stream.
[11:21.540 --> 11:22.300]  Thank you very much.
[11:24.420 --> 11:25.680]  Keep a little push.
[11:26.700 --> 11:27.480]  A little more.
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.660]  I'm going to add to the length of this.
[11:30.120 --> 11:30.820]  Yeah, it's a good idea.
[11:30.960 --> 11:31.400]  Just for safety.
[11:33.620 --> 11:36.080]  Dude, Schindler's Fist just gifted five more Schindler's Fists.
[11:40.900 --> 11:41.620]  Insane username.
[11:41.820 --> 11:42.160]  I love it.
[11:43.340 --> 11:47.540]  That really, I think that really was one of the first times where, out loud,
[11:47.620 --> 11:48.320]  I said, that's awesome.
[11:48.380 --> 11:49.800]  You can name yourself anything on this website.
[11:52.620 --> 11:53.940]  All right, did I get a checkpoint?
[11:54.080 --> 11:54.860]  I don't want to do that again.
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.220]  I mean, I will do it again.
[11:57.340 --> 11:59.480]  But yeah, I don't want to do it right now.
[11:59.640 --> 11:59.860]  Let's not.
[11:59.940 --> 12:01.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
[12:04.400 --> 12:04.920]  You okay?
[12:05.380 --> 12:05.900]  Are you hiding?
[12:06.160 --> 12:08.800]  I was just hoping that if I stood here long enough, the credits would just roll.
[12:08.920 --> 12:09.540]  It would give me the achievement.
[12:09.560 --> 12:10.240]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[12:10.360 --> 12:11.680]  And then, like, you beat it and you get the thing.
[12:11.680 --> 12:12.460]  That would be really cool.
[12:12.560 --> 12:13.300]  That'd be really cool.
[12:13.660 --> 12:15.320]  Is that going to land on my goddamn head?
[12:15.600 --> 12:16.400]  Ugh, okay.
[12:21.040 --> 12:21.320]  Shit.
[12:21.420 --> 12:21.640]  Spider!
[12:22.020 --> 12:22.300]  Shit.
[12:22.660 --> 12:23.420]  Oh, there it is.
[12:23.480 --> 12:23.940]  There's the spider.
[12:25.180 --> 12:25.460]  Shitty.
[12:28.560 --> 12:30.740]  It's running as far away as you can.
[12:31.000 --> 12:31.200]  Hello?
[12:33.100 --> 12:35.420]  I don't think a breeze is going to knock that down.
[12:35.500 --> 12:37.320]  I think you're going to have to do something.
[12:38.640 --> 12:38.940]  Hello?
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.840]  Go say hi to the spider.
[12:43.300 --> 12:44.620]  Go say hi to the spider.
[12:44.980 --> 12:45.720]  Sup, little spit?
[12:47.540 --> 12:48.970]  Hey, what's going on?
[12:48.970 --> 12:49.410]  Oh.
[12:59.630 --> 13:01.430]  You're in kind of like a standoff.
[13:08.110 --> 13:08.550]  Okay.
[13:11.830 --> 13:12.590]  Careful now.
[13:13.010 --> 13:14.090]  Did that knock down the bear trap?
[13:16.470 --> 13:16.910]  Almost.
[13:17.030 --> 13:17.190]  No.
[13:17.430 --> 13:18.470]  Nope, it moved though.
[13:21.330 --> 13:22.370]  Hit it with another one.
[13:22.990 --> 13:23.630]  Come on.
[13:23.930 --> 13:24.830]  There you go.
[13:25.990 --> 13:26.990]  All right, let's start.
[13:27.090 --> 13:27.270]  Yeah.
[13:27.530 --> 13:28.210]  Let's start shopping.
[13:29.690 --> 13:30.450]  Oh, wow.
[13:33.970 --> 13:35.810]  Which cats are hanging out with you right now, Gavin?
[13:36.190 --> 13:36.710]  Oh, let me look.
[13:38.070 --> 13:38.390]  Smee?
[13:39.670 --> 13:39.950]  No.
[13:40.170 --> 13:40.850]  Smee's the only one.
[13:42.550 --> 13:42.950]  Careful.
[13:46.350 --> 13:47.170]  Is that common?
[13:48.630 --> 13:49.270]  Yeah, he's...
[13:49.270 --> 13:52.070]  Come on, you want a slice of this, son?
[13:52.090 --> 13:53.510]  You want a slice of that?
[13:53.990 --> 13:54.850]  What you got?
[13:55.050 --> 13:55.590]  What is this?
[13:55.770 --> 13:55.930]  Okay.
[13:56.070 --> 13:56.490]  He missed.
[13:57.370 --> 13:58.710]  You pull it back just a hair.
[13:59.330 --> 13:59.990]  Yeah, there you go.
[14:01.150 --> 14:01.730]  There you go.
[14:01.770 --> 14:03.350]  You have to activate and then pull it.
[14:03.470 --> 14:03.970]  Yeah, here you go.
[14:05.290 --> 14:05.930]  Dangerous game.
[14:06.470 --> 14:06.690]  Nope.
[14:08.810 --> 14:09.390]  Here it comes.
[14:11.210 --> 14:11.730]  That's right.
[14:13.690 --> 14:15.070]  That's right, you idiot spider.
[14:15.290 --> 14:16.270]  Yeah, chop, son.
[14:18.570 --> 14:19.250]  Did you win?
[14:20.030 --> 14:20.590]  Let's go again.
[14:21.210 --> 14:22.090]  Oh my god.
[14:22.230 --> 14:22.410]  Oh.
[14:22.910 --> 14:24.310]  The spider, the spider's an idiot.
[14:24.910 --> 14:25.550]  He's foolish.
[14:26.610 --> 14:27.630]  Spider's a moron.
[14:28.570 --> 14:30.430]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:30.650 --> 14:31.450]  I got some range.
[14:32.150 --> 14:32.470]  Yeah.
[14:33.010 --> 14:34.190]  That slid into me.
[14:34.510 --> 14:35.550]  That, that got really...
[14:38.510 --> 14:39.870]  That was, uh, pretty nerve-wracking.
[14:41.550 --> 14:45.250]  I gotta be fast on this one because he's got some, he's got some reach with this one.
[14:50.990 --> 14:52.190]  Come on, you bastard.
[14:53.330 --> 14:54.330]  There we go.
[14:56.570 --> 14:57.010]  No.
[14:57.690 --> 14:58.390]  Okay, now what?
[14:59.110 --> 15:00.410]  Go to hell, spider.
[15:01.470 --> 15:02.490]  I don't know, ask Meg.
[15:10.290 --> 15:10.730]  Okay.
[15:11.470 --> 15:12.090]  All right.
[15:12.970 --> 15:13.750]  You're doing great so far.
[15:13.810 --> 15:17.130]  Only one death and this, like, this game is probably like almost, you're what, like three
[15:17.130 --> 15:17.810]  quarters of the way through?
[15:19.650 --> 15:20.350]  Ah, shit.
[15:21.450 --> 15:22.130]  What's this?
[15:25.430 --> 15:25.790]  Okay.
[15:27.990 --> 15:29.250]  See, the game's gonna start.
[15:29.470 --> 15:33.770]  I'm just gonna get distance and the game's gonna lure me into full sense of security.
[15:34.090 --> 15:36.030]  And I'm just gonna walk straight into you.
[15:37.110 --> 15:37.990]  I'm in the nest.
[15:38.890 --> 15:39.990]  I'm in the spider nest.
[15:40.910 --> 15:42.350]  Oh, that's good, the spider's not in here though, right?
[15:42.430 --> 15:42.650]  I'm slow.
[15:43.470 --> 15:44.170]  I'm slow.
[15:48.830 --> 15:50.070]  Is this a part of it?
[15:50.110 --> 15:50.790]  Does he take me?
[15:50.810 --> 15:51.310]  Oh my god, run.
[15:51.710 --> 15:52.410]  Go, go, go.
[15:52.410 --> 15:53.430]  Why are you stopped?
[15:54.570 --> 15:55.890]  Maybe I'll be, I'll play dead.
[16:00.850 --> 16:02.170]  Did playing dead work?
[16:06.130 --> 16:06.330]  Oh.
[16:08.430 --> 16:09.230]  Uh-oh.
[16:10.910 --> 16:11.810]  I'm still breathing.
[16:12.610 --> 16:13.050]  I'm still alive.
[16:13.110 --> 16:13.590]  Is this good or bad?
[16:14.670 --> 16:15.270]  I just gotta...
[16:15.270 --> 16:18.830]  This feels like a thing a rich person would pay for to live two days longer.
[16:21.550 --> 16:23.830]  Get wrapped on spider web, spider suit.
[16:23.830 --> 16:23.930]  Yeah.
[16:26.970 --> 16:28.030]  Get me off.
[16:28.370 --> 16:29.210]  Get me out of this.
[16:29.970 --> 16:31.250]  Get me out of this.
[16:31.890 --> 16:32.610]  Wiggle, wangle.
[16:33.310 --> 16:33.770]  Come on.
[16:34.950 --> 16:35.190]  Okay.
[16:35.290 --> 16:35.790]  Almost there.
[16:35.950 --> 16:36.350]  There you go.
[16:36.370 --> 16:37.030]  Now we're on the move.
[16:38.510 --> 16:41.110]  Okay, I pulled up a full play that has zero deaths.
[16:41.270 --> 16:44.610]  It's an hour long and Gavin is seven minutes into this video.
[16:44.930 --> 16:46.150]  Oh my god.
[16:46.670 --> 16:47.630]  All right, how do I...
[16:47.630 --> 16:48.190]  That's awesome.
[16:48.530 --> 16:48.810]  How do I...
[16:48.810 --> 16:49.890]  You're almost there.
[16:50.430 --> 16:51.150]  You're good.
[16:52.090 --> 16:53.470]  Do a little baby ones.
[16:54.010 --> 16:55.210]  Yep, nice.
[16:55.290 --> 16:56.010]  Good jump.
[16:57.850 --> 16:59.490]  Boing, boing, boing.
[16:59.750 --> 17:00.910]  It's an hour long.
[17:01.010 --> 17:02.030]  That's horrific.
[17:03.690 --> 17:04.890]  That's the way it is, man.
[17:08.570 --> 17:09.170]  Okay.
[17:11.670 --> 17:16.670]  I was literally trying to do one of those micro jumps and he went full bore.
[17:17.370 --> 17:18.270]  That sucked.
[17:18.270 --> 17:19.530]  That was such a waste.
[17:20.010 --> 17:22.170]  That was just fat thumbing.
[17:24.630 --> 17:25.730]  How do I do it all?
[17:25.730 --> 17:26.150]  That's the way it goes, man.
[17:28.810 --> 17:29.970]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:30.250 --> 17:31.610]  Little, little one.
[17:31.930 --> 17:32.570]  Little one.
[17:32.830 --> 17:33.650]  Little one.
[17:33.990 --> 17:34.490]  Big one!
[17:34.930 --> 17:34.970]  No!
[17:35.770 --> 17:36.290]  Three.
[17:37.390 --> 17:38.430]  Guys, that'd be three.
[17:38.610 --> 17:39.550]  That one was on me.
[17:39.790 --> 17:40.930]  That was a misjudgment.
[17:42.230 --> 17:42.530]  Yeah.
[17:43.510 --> 17:44.510]  Oh, shit.
[17:44.690 --> 17:45.650]  I'm losing it.
[17:46.510 --> 17:47.230]  No, it's okay.
[17:47.310 --> 17:47.650]  It's okay.
[17:47.650 --> 17:48.630]  You're doing great.
[17:50.010 --> 17:51.210]  You're learning.
[17:51.810 --> 17:54.950]  Little, little, little one.
[17:55.770 --> 17:58.370]  I can't go anymore, surely.
[17:59.310 --> 18:00.450]  Surely, yeah.
[18:03.770 --> 18:04.990]  Guys, that's four.
[18:07.330 --> 18:09.150]  What do I need to do?
[18:09.770 --> 18:11.610]  What am I doing wrong?
[18:12.390 --> 18:13.950]  Can you, like, momentum?
[18:14.350 --> 18:15.890]  Oh, hang on.
[18:16.810 --> 18:17.170]  Okay.
[18:18.530 --> 18:19.050]  Oh.
[18:20.530 --> 18:21.730]  It's momentum, right?
[18:21.970 --> 18:22.210]  No.
[18:23.530 --> 18:25.390]  I realized I wasn't jumping.
[18:26.350 --> 18:26.870]  What?
[18:28.070 --> 18:29.510]  It was doing little hops.
[18:30.150 --> 18:32.470]  But I could just full-blown do a jump.
[18:32.690 --> 18:33.390]  You idiot!
[18:33.830 --> 18:34.570]  What a waste!
[18:35.370 --> 18:38.210]  You wasted three lives on not jumping.
[18:38.670 --> 18:41.030]  I just thought because I was hopping, I was already jumping.
[18:41.970 --> 18:43.070]  Oh, what a fat idiot.
[18:44.770 --> 18:45.330]  That's it!
[18:45.330 --> 18:46.550]  You forgot to do it.
[18:46.590 --> 18:47.270]  That's five.
[18:47.270 --> 18:50.210]  So now, Gavin, I want to leave it up to you.
[18:50.310 --> 18:51.350]  Do you want to keep it going?
[18:51.550 --> 18:52.570]  Do you want to start a new game?
[18:52.670 --> 18:53.030]  Okay, cool.
[18:53.070 --> 18:53.710]  We're going to start from the...
[18:53.710 --> 18:54.810]  This is what it is.
[18:54.850 --> 18:55.270]  It's practice.
[18:55.450 --> 18:55.770]  It's reps.
[18:56.770 --> 18:57.370]  It's commitment.
[18:58.030 --> 19:00.230]  All right, but we've got so much knowledge now.
[19:00.890 --> 19:01.690]  This will be faster.
[19:02.830 --> 19:03.050]  Yeah.
[19:04.630 --> 19:05.370]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:07.550 --> 19:10.110]  RC Stungus just gifted me a sub to this channel.
[19:13.310 --> 19:14.290]  Thank you so much.
[19:14.310 --> 19:15.870]  I can finally use the emotes, guys.
[19:16.490 --> 19:21.070]  I want to point out that it's complete the game in one sitting with five or less deaths.
[19:21.150 --> 19:22.630]  So you didn't need to reset there.
[19:22.730 --> 19:24.930]  You had one more death to give.
[19:25.330 --> 19:26.950]  Look, there was nothing smart about any of that.
[19:27.510 --> 19:28.230]  I get it.
[19:28.530 --> 19:29.110]  I get it.
[19:33.210 --> 19:35.610]  Look at the speedrun tempo he's at right now, though.
[19:35.990 --> 19:37.330]  Oh, he's way ahead of the full play.
[19:37.670 --> 19:39.090]  Yeah, I ain't stopping for shit.
[19:40.230 --> 19:40.830]  See this?
[19:41.350 --> 19:41.870]  See this?
[19:43.390 --> 19:44.630]  You're crushing it right now, bud.
[19:46.770 --> 19:47.790]  Careful of the rope burn.
[19:49.490 --> 19:51.390]  Don't even need to climb the rest of the way.
[19:54.030 --> 19:54.390]  Flying.
[19:54.610 --> 19:55.310]  Look at you go.
[19:56.730 --> 19:57.430]  Baby mode.
[20:00.050 --> 20:03.170]  Madgari with 10 gifted because they know you're on the speedrun tip, baby.
[20:03.290 --> 20:03.670]  Thank you.
[20:04.490 --> 20:05.170]  Saxophone Yeti.
[20:05.230 --> 20:05.730]  Same thing.
[20:05.950 --> 20:06.450]  Great name.
[20:10.570 --> 20:14.090]  Yeah, I wonder what my funny username would have been if I didn't just always have my name.
[20:14.750 --> 20:15.250]  Yeah, right.
[20:15.410 --> 20:15.690]  Same.
[20:15.850 --> 20:17.690]  Because it's like, I don't know.
[20:18.350 --> 20:20.010]  It's it's very it's interesting.
[20:20.150 --> 20:21.550]  You can kind of like go anywhere with it.
[20:22.270 --> 20:24.330]  I think I'd be like a worms names.
[20:25.110 --> 20:25.510]  Yeah.
[20:25.750 --> 20:27.890]  Well, like Tub Nugs or something.
[20:28.770 --> 20:29.370]  Tub Nugs.
[20:30.650 --> 20:36.650]  I've been using if it's a game that I don't think like my name needs to be attached to.
[20:36.710 --> 20:39.710]  I've been using Ratsodogbrains and that feels pretty good.
[20:42.190 --> 20:46.350]  Because it's like, oh, you'd like you just died to Ratsodogbrains like in an online game.
[20:46.350 --> 20:50.490]  You just go, who the fuck is Ratsodogbrains and makes you feel bad.
[20:50.730 --> 20:56.010]  I don't want to use Tub Nugs anymore because Janera said Tub Nugs is when you shit in the bath.
[20:57.410 --> 20:58.410]  Oh no.
[20:59.210 --> 21:00.790]  Yeah, that does sound like that's what it is.
[21:03.230 --> 21:04.550]  Yeah, like Enron Burgundy.
[21:04.810 --> 21:05.550]  Great name.
[21:05.810 --> 21:07.150]  That's a fantastic name.
[21:07.550 --> 21:07.850]  Damn.
[21:08.230 --> 21:08.630]  Enron.
[21:09.270 --> 21:11.070]  The world feels very Enron right now.
[21:11.750 --> 21:12.430]  Oh, big time.
[21:13.730 --> 21:17.430]  I can pull, especially when I can't get that Nintendo Switch.
[21:18.670 --> 21:19.590]  Oh, Gavin!
[21:19.890 --> 21:20.950]  All right, boys, there's one.
[21:21.190 --> 21:22.670]  Frickin' head fell off.
[21:22.750 --> 21:23.410]  This sucks.
[21:24.430 --> 21:26.490]  That was that was a death I'd never had before.
[21:27.110 --> 21:28.150]  Nuh-uh, that's a tough one.
[21:28.210 --> 21:28.610]  New death.
[21:30.710 --> 21:31.370]  There you go.
[21:31.490 --> 21:31.730]  Easy.
[21:32.370 --> 21:37.150]  I had Marvel Rivals last night as Gavin Free and it's just fun to know that
[21:37.790 --> 21:39.790]  there might be someone who thinks it's him.
[21:39.990 --> 21:42.370]  And yeah, I'm disappointing greatly.
[21:42.430 --> 21:43.130]  Yep.
[21:43.910 --> 21:44.850]  It's flying around.
[21:45.110 --> 21:45.950]  This isn't Gavin, this is Andrew.
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.780]  Who are you playing as in Marvel Rivals?
[21:53.240 --> 21:55.260]  I just am starting, so I don't really know.
[21:55.500 --> 21:57.720]  I started as Spider-Man as a joke because I know.
[21:57.800 --> 21:59.060]  Oh, that's so hard.
[22:01.540 --> 22:04.880]  I am leaning towards the tank characters so far from what I play.
[22:05.080 --> 22:05.460]  Tanks are fun.
[22:06.560 --> 22:09.100]  I really recommend Mr. Fantastic.
[22:09.940 --> 22:11.420]  He can take a lot of damage.
[22:11.740 --> 22:12.580]  He can take a lot of damage.
[22:14.040 --> 22:14.660]  Thor's fun.
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.880]  I like Thor, but there's like a little bit of strategy to him.
[22:17.420 --> 22:19.280]  I was outraged to learn that there's no Reaper,
[22:19.520 --> 22:22.320]  that they like stole everything from Overwatch but Reaper.
[22:22.560 --> 22:24.020]  That's the one character I would play.
[22:24.380 --> 22:26.260]  Yeah, there really is no Reaper.
[22:31.220 --> 22:33.260]  Limbo, limbo, limbo, yeah.
[22:34.260 --> 22:38.380]  They announced Emma Frost and Ultron
[22:38.960 --> 22:41.940]  and a new tropical skin for Rocket Raccoon.
[22:42.080 --> 22:43.200]  I call them pelts.
[22:43.360 --> 22:44.620]  I'm excited for his new pelt.
[22:44.700 --> 22:45.660]  Getting a new pelt?
[22:46.120 --> 22:46.340]  Yeah.
[22:48.560 --> 22:50.660]  I think where he has like a tropical hat on, I think.
[22:51.040 --> 22:51.560]  It's pretty exciting.
[22:52.140 --> 22:54.400]  I'd be more enticed to buy a skin if it was called a pelt.
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.440]  I'd buy a new pelt.
[22:55.940 --> 22:56.100]  Yeah.
[23:00.290 --> 23:00.690]  Oops.
[23:02.290 --> 23:02.930]  Well, that was...
[23:03.870 --> 23:05.810]  You're falling apart, amigo.
[23:06.370 --> 23:12.230]  If anyone actually believed you were just playing a video, that illusion's dead.
[23:12.570 --> 23:13.750]  Why is it jumping backwards?
[23:14.610 --> 23:15.770]  Because you're jumping backwards.
[23:15.770 --> 23:20.630]  What are you doing?
[23:21.870 --> 23:24.010]  GERPAUL'S GLUG RACE, 10 gifted subs.
[23:24.230 --> 23:25.210]  Oh, thank you.
[23:26.470 --> 23:27.670]  We had the birth of...
[23:27.670 --> 23:28.470]  What am I doing?
[23:28.590 --> 23:29.550]  We had the birth of GERPAUL this week.
[23:29.550 --> 23:30.290]  What are you doing?
[23:30.730 --> 23:32.630]  Yep. Yeah, GERPAUL was pretty interesting.
[23:33.450 --> 23:34.910]  You can't even get on it now, man.
[23:36.790 --> 23:37.630]  He's falling apart.
[23:38.230 --> 23:40.690]  I thought all of our wrestlers in the 2K25 game was a lot of fun.
[23:41.230 --> 23:42.370]  Yeah, we need to do that again.
[23:42.810 --> 23:43.050]  Yeah.
[23:44.950 --> 23:45.750]  Why does it keep bouncing?
[23:45.750 --> 23:47.610]  It's moving right before I jump, you idiot!
[23:47.850 --> 23:48.970]  You have been...
[23:48.970 --> 23:50.010]  Dude, what are you doing?
[23:50.250 --> 23:51.450]  Why did you restart this?
[23:51.530 --> 23:51.790]  Jeez.
[23:55.960 --> 23:57.420]  Oh, yeah, and there's that new...
[23:57.420 --> 23:59.900]  There's that new Bond game that they're making?
[24:00.060 --> 24:01.240]  The Hitman team is making?
[24:01.240 --> 24:04.000]  I could not believe they teased that at the Nintendo thing.
[24:04.100 --> 24:05.100]  I lost my mind.
[24:05.160 --> 24:05.660]  Did it look good?
[24:06.660 --> 24:08.440]  It was just a barrel of a gun.
[24:08.760 --> 24:09.780]  Yeah, they just announced it.
[24:10.000 --> 24:10.140]  Yeah.
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.820]  But it feels like a thing, you guys.
[24:13.360 --> 24:13.880]  That feels...
[24:13.880 --> 24:14.340]  Oh, I cannot wait.
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.700]  I've been anticipating it for like five years.
[24:19.720 --> 24:20.660]  Oh, shit.
[24:21.880 --> 24:22.400]  Hello.
[24:23.760 --> 24:24.780]  Braxerman10gifted, thank you.
[24:26.460 --> 24:26.720]  Oops.
[24:32.620 --> 24:35.180]  Shove, shove, shove, shove, big old log.
[24:35.540 --> 24:37.040]  Gonna float me over.
[24:38.340 --> 24:39.240]  Is this Tub Nugs?
[24:39.740 --> 24:40.360]  Oh, no.
[24:42.320 --> 24:43.380]  Oh, that's not enough.
[24:45.240 --> 24:45.680]  You don't think so?
[24:46.100 --> 24:46.800]  I have, uh, yeah.
[24:48.700 --> 24:49.860]  Oh, yeah. Now you're way closer.
[24:50.300 --> 24:50.540]  Easy.
[24:52.960 --> 24:55.100]  So what, now you have a spider coming up, right?
[24:55.780 --> 24:56.040]  Yeah.
[24:56.260 --> 24:56.460]  Yeah.
[24:56.720 --> 24:57.380]  Little spidey.
[25:01.710 --> 25:04.570]  I assume most people get this achievement, they just play through a few times, right?
[25:04.610 --> 25:05.750]  And then just memorize everything?
[25:06.470 --> 25:06.650]  Yeah.
[25:06.770 --> 25:08.630]  They don't just restart after six deaths.
[25:09.250 --> 25:10.010]  Oh, shit!
[25:11.990 --> 25:12.990]  Did it knock it down?
[25:14.090 --> 25:15.290]  That was so close.
[25:15.950 --> 25:16.710]  Yeah, that was crazy.
[25:19.250 --> 25:20.230]  Come on, boy.
[25:21.430 --> 25:22.130]  Come on, son.
[25:22.650 --> 25:23.410]  That's it.
[25:26.650 --> 25:27.730]  There you go.
[25:28.750 --> 25:29.370]  There you go.
[25:29.950 --> 25:30.930]  That had to be enough, right?
[25:31.070 --> 25:31.150]  One more.
[25:32.350 --> 25:33.010]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[25:33.230 --> 25:34.790]  Oh, man, I didn't move at all.
[25:34.930 --> 25:36.610]  I had a ting and I thought that was it.
[25:37.350 --> 25:37.550]  Yeah.
[25:39.510 --> 25:40.290]  Now you're good.
[25:41.690 --> 25:42.390]  There it is.
[25:43.070 --> 25:44.130]  Don't step on it.
[25:46.330 --> 25:47.570]  What helpful insight.
[25:48.490 --> 25:48.710]  Yep.
[25:48.710 --> 25:50.330]  You already stepped on it once.
[25:50.430 --> 25:52.950]  Well, I should step on that this time.
[25:53.230 --> 25:54.370]  No, I was just making sure.
[25:54.750 --> 25:54.910]  Yeah.
[25:55.010 --> 25:56.990]  You may have thought, hmm, bear trap.
[25:57.070 --> 25:57.610]  Not for me.
[25:58.410 --> 25:58.710]  I'm a person.
[25:58.710 --> 25:59.030]  Yeah, people.
[26:00.310 --> 26:01.110]  Well, that's not going to hit.
[26:01.130 --> 26:02.170]  Once again, it's not going to work.
[26:02.270 --> 26:03.970]  You got to... it locks onto you.
[26:04.490 --> 26:05.870]  Yeah, and you got to like move it back some.
[26:06.770 --> 26:08.250]  Well, the third one reaches further.
[26:09.530 --> 26:10.990]  Okay, well, luckily you're on the first one.
[26:11.130 --> 26:11.330]  Yeah.
[26:18.790 --> 26:19.930]  How many deaths are we on right now?
[26:19.970 --> 26:20.130]  One?
[26:20.350 --> 26:20.570]  One.
[26:21.310 --> 26:21.630]  Okay.
[26:23.950 --> 26:24.310]  Hey!
[26:25.650 --> 26:26.010]  Wow.
[26:27.370 --> 26:29.390]  And now it's just as slow as the other ones.
[26:29.650 --> 26:29.870]  Yep.
[26:31.810 --> 26:32.530]  There you go.
[26:34.410 --> 26:36.110]  Oh, just barely, but you got him.
[26:36.610 --> 26:37.930]  Take that, stupid spider.
[26:39.010 --> 26:40.110]  Oh, I just walked through that.
[26:40.210 --> 26:40.670]  I didn't even...
[26:41.510 --> 26:42.890]  Yeah, it breaks on the third one.
[26:42.890 --> 26:43.190]  That's good.
[26:43.290 --> 26:44.430]  You did the same thing last time.
[26:44.550 --> 26:45.130]  Yeah, I just forgot.
[26:45.250 --> 26:45.810]  It scared me.
[26:47.230 --> 26:49.550]  It scared me that you did it the first time, but...
[26:51.850 --> 26:52.790]  You're lucky it breaks.
[26:53.010 --> 26:53.830]  Oh, why'd I jump there?
[26:54.370 --> 26:55.390]  I'm just getting sloppy.
[26:55.770 --> 26:56.290]  That's not cool.
[26:56.710 --> 26:57.750]  I'm not losing concentration.
[26:58.710 --> 26:59.630]  No, no, you got to walk in.
[27:01.010 --> 27:01.930]  So, I'm pretty...
[27:01.930 --> 27:02.750]  You get stuck in the stuff up here.
[27:02.830 --> 27:03.830]  There's not much to go wrong.
[27:04.550 --> 27:04.630]  Mm-hmm.
[27:05.930 --> 27:08.650]  Yeah, they make me jump so shitty, like...
[27:11.910 --> 27:15.430]  This is probably one of the safest sections in the game for you at the moment.
[27:27.090 --> 27:27.810]  Say easy.
[27:31.430 --> 27:36.670]  It's so rare that a game without any HUD and without any cutscene happens anymore,
[27:36.770 --> 27:37.850]  but I freaking love it.
[27:39.190 --> 27:41.810]  Oh, this is kind of a cutscene, but I mean, like, no opening cutscene.
[27:42.590 --> 27:42.830]  Right.
[27:45.890 --> 27:46.870]  It's very different.
[27:52.250 --> 27:52.990]  Someone just let rip?
[27:53.310 --> 27:53.630]  What was that?
[27:55.490 --> 27:56.790]  I don't know what that was.
[27:56.790 --> 28:00.450]  A little shake.
[28:02.610 --> 28:03.970]  See, look at these hops now.
[28:04.050 --> 28:04.930]  Look at this, boing.
[28:05.130 --> 28:05.810]  Yeah, look at you go.
[28:05.910 --> 28:07.430]  Look what happens when you press the jump button, dude.
[28:07.430 --> 28:08.050]  That's crazy.
[28:13.950 --> 28:15.010]  Boing, yeah, boing.
[28:15.310 --> 28:15.930]  Look at that boing.
[28:19.560 --> 28:20.360]  Look at you go.
[28:20.960 --> 28:22.980]  You can do little baby hops, and then you can do your big hop.
[28:23.420 --> 28:23.720]  Oh, little hops, and then...
[28:24.620 --> 28:25.220]  There you go.
[28:25.280 --> 28:25.860]  Oh, wow, it's so easy.
[28:25.860 --> 28:27.040]  See how easy it is when you jump?
[28:27.260 --> 28:27.460]  Yep.
[28:27.460 --> 28:28.700]  That's so easy when you jump.
[28:29.560 --> 28:31.100]  I just, for some reason, thought I couldn't jump.
[28:31.800 --> 28:34.600]  He's about to set a new distance record.
[28:36.140 --> 28:37.480]  What was this last time?
[28:37.660 --> 28:38.020]  I forgot.
[28:39.840 --> 28:40.720]  Uh, you have to jump.
[28:41.020 --> 28:41.520]  You didn't jump.
[28:41.600 --> 28:42.740]  So I got to jump much earlier.
[28:43.560 --> 28:43.780]  Yeah.
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.440]  Yep, that's two.
[28:51.140 --> 28:51.500]  Jump!
[28:51.880 --> 28:52.140]  Okay.
[28:52.420 --> 28:52.920]  There you go.
[28:53.020 --> 28:53.840]  There you go, it's easy.
[28:57.530 --> 28:57.890]  Oh.
[28:58.950 --> 28:59.470]  You got it.
[28:59.630 --> 28:59.950]  Oh, shit.
[28:59.950 --> 29:00.310]  You got it.
[29:00.410 --> 29:01.710]  Shit, shit, shit.
[29:01.710 --> 29:02.550]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[29:03.010 --> 29:03.790]  There you go, you're fine.
[29:07.630 --> 29:08.990]  Okay, not too bad.
[29:10.090 --> 29:12.050]  Oh, is this, uh, is this a rollie?
[29:12.610 --> 29:13.530]  What's gonna happen this?
[29:13.970 --> 29:14.630]  Looks like a rollie.
[29:14.850 --> 29:15.350]  Oh, it is.
[29:15.530 --> 29:15.990]  Oh, shit.
[29:16.530 --> 29:17.010]  We got it.
[29:17.190 --> 29:18.010]  You got it.
[29:18.090 --> 29:18.330]  Shit.
[29:19.650 --> 29:21.550]  This, this isn't good at all.
[29:23.250 --> 29:23.870]  What do you mean?
[29:24.050 --> 29:24.710]  You're doing great.
[29:27.710 --> 29:28.590]  Just, uh...
[29:28.590 --> 29:28.910]  Ah!
[29:31.890 --> 29:33.010]  Hey, the spider's back.
[29:33.410 --> 29:33.530]  Roll.
[29:33.750 --> 29:34.750]  Do I have to stay on the front?
[29:37.650 --> 29:38.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're doing fine.
[29:39.470 --> 29:40.690]  He's gonna skewer me.
[29:41.490 --> 29:42.310]  And then what am I doing?
[29:42.750 --> 29:43.930]  Ah, this sucks!
[29:45.070 --> 29:45.910]  You're fine, you're fine.
[29:46.070 --> 29:47.890]  You're doing great, you're doing great, you're doing great, you're doing great.
[29:48.090 --> 29:48.550]  There you go.
[29:48.830 --> 29:50.070]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[29:50.570 --> 29:51.070]  Oh, shit.
[29:51.230 --> 29:51.510]  I'm free!
[29:51.790 --> 29:53.530]  Look, we're out of it.
[29:53.730 --> 29:53.990]  See?
[29:54.570 --> 29:55.030]  Did I live?
[29:55.150 --> 29:55.470]  Yes!
[29:55.830 --> 29:56.150]  Let's go!
[29:56.190 --> 29:59.890]  And you've only, you've only died twice and you're this far into the game.
[29:59.990 --> 30:01.050]  You gotta be, like, almost done.
[30:01.050 --> 30:03.270]  Andrew said it only takes an hour to beat this.
[30:03.630 --> 30:06.050]  Yeah, you're probably 10 minutes into the full play at this point.
[30:06.310 --> 30:06.750]  Yeah.
[30:07.570 --> 30:07.850]  Hello?
[30:07.850 --> 30:08.410]  What do you got there?
[30:08.510 --> 30:09.070]  Is that a person?
[30:12.470 --> 30:12.910]  Oh!
[30:14.070 --> 30:14.510]  Okay.
[30:15.290 --> 30:16.390]  It's a trick and a trap.
[30:17.490 --> 30:18.630]  You've been tricked and trapped.
[30:20.310 --> 30:23.630]  I don't know what you were thinking was gonna happen.
[30:24.090 --> 30:24.870]  I think that's three.
[30:25.330 --> 30:26.210]  That's three.
[30:26.510 --> 30:27.190]  I, uh...
[30:27.190 --> 30:28.610]  Did you just not notice the bear trap?
[30:28.710 --> 30:29.550]  Didn't remotely notice.
[30:30.170 --> 30:30.390]  Ah!
[30:32.410 --> 30:33.370]  Fair enough, then.
[30:33.690 --> 30:33.990]  What am I?
[30:34.150 --> 30:34.770]  Oh, shit.
[30:35.550 --> 30:36.150]  I don't know.
[30:37.810 --> 30:40.170]  Jumping into the trap activation while saying,
[30:40.350 --> 30:40.950]  What am I?
[30:44.730 --> 30:45.170]  Okay.
[30:45.490 --> 30:45.770]  Nice.
[30:46.230 --> 30:46.650]  Easy.
[30:46.850 --> 30:47.230]  Three.
[30:47.970 --> 30:48.990]  We're on three.
[30:49.390 --> 30:50.030]  Not great.
[30:50.290 --> 30:50.890]  It's simple. It's easy. It's nothing.
[30:56.060 --> 30:56.820]  Oh my god.
[30:57.420 --> 30:58.400]  Seemed like such a late jump.
[30:58.740 --> 30:59.240]  Big jumps.
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.360]  There you go.
[31:00.940 --> 31:01.900]  Why am I gonna jump that?
[31:02.020 --> 31:02.620]  That's not doable.
[31:03.020 --> 31:03.520]  Is it?
[31:03.700 --> 31:04.000]  What do you mean?
[31:04.280 --> 31:04.940]  Yeah, why not?
[31:05.000 --> 31:05.680]  Just go high up.
[31:07.060 --> 31:07.860]  Hey, look at that.
[31:08.040 --> 31:08.360]  Perfect.
[31:08.920 --> 31:09.380]  All right, hold on.
[31:09.400 --> 31:09.940]  Let me think about this.
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.840]  You just, you're gonna hit that and then that's gonna fall on you, right?
[31:12.920 --> 31:13.460]  Gonna jump back.
[31:15.020 --> 31:15.940]  Yeah, I think so.
[31:20.720 --> 31:22.980]  I think it's more like a jump-jump type thing.
[31:25.200 --> 31:25.520]  Oh.
[31:28.160 --> 31:28.660]  There you go.
[31:28.760 --> 31:29.500]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[31:30.180 --> 31:30.500]  Wow.
[31:34.140 --> 31:35.620]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[31:36.280 --> 31:36.560]  There you go.
[31:38.160 --> 31:38.880]  Oh, where's...
[31:38.880 --> 31:40.020]  Is it that short one right there?
[31:41.580 --> 31:41.940]  Nice.
[31:43.140 --> 31:43.680]  Look out!
[31:45.840 --> 31:47.140]  I thought it was gonna come back.
[31:47.600 --> 31:48.400]  Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[31:50.000 --> 31:50.360]  Jump!
[31:50.640 --> 31:51.460]  Oh my god.
[31:53.980 --> 31:54.340]  This...
[31:54.340 --> 31:55.460]  Dude, you're flying right now.
[31:59.530 --> 32:01.310]  I wonder how far I'm gonna get by 5.01 because...
[32:02.250 --> 32:05.150]  Really, I'm gonna need to be playing until like 11.01 to get this.
[32:05.170 --> 32:05.690]  Yeah.
[32:07.190 --> 32:08.750]  We'll do it in an actual video.
[32:08.890 --> 32:09.890]  We're just sort of like...
[32:09.890 --> 32:10.590]  It's just a warm-up to you?
[32:10.970 --> 32:11.750]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:11.750 --> 32:12.530]  You get some reps in.
[32:12.590 --> 32:13.350]  It's all about practice.
[32:15.030 --> 32:15.830]  Spider puppet?
[32:17.170 --> 32:17.610]  Oh.
[32:18.170 --> 32:18.570]  Pretend...
[32:18.570 --> 32:19.770]  Fucking pretend-ass spider.
[32:20.730 --> 32:21.210]  Can I like...
[32:27.820 --> 32:28.960]  You didn't die?
[32:29.140 --> 32:29.720]  Oh my god.
[32:30.020 --> 32:30.640]  Oh, you lived!
[32:31.040 --> 32:31.480]  Wow.
[32:32.220 --> 32:33.180]  I live, bitch.
[32:34.700 --> 32:35.700]  Get away from that!
[32:37.020 --> 32:38.120]  I'm the spider now.
[32:41.240 --> 32:43.100]  This is how I would have been doing it.
[32:43.380 --> 32:43.640]  Yeah?
[32:44.060 --> 32:45.060]  That's pretty good.
[32:45.580 --> 32:46.520]  Sure ones, sure ones.
[32:50.500 --> 32:51.040]  Oh.
[32:52.820 --> 32:55.080]  Do I need some sting?
[32:56.000 --> 32:56.640]  I don't know.
[32:56.840 --> 32:57.780]  Can you make that jump?
[32:58.060 --> 32:58.760]  That's close.
[32:59.020 --> 33:00.340]  Is there something like under this?
[33:01.980 --> 33:02.240]  No.
[33:07.760 --> 33:08.220]  Hold!
[33:08.220 --> 33:08.560]  Hold!
[33:11.680 --> 33:12.800]  I guess I just jump.
[33:13.520 --> 33:14.280]  Guess you try.
[33:15.940 --> 33:16.360]  Oh, okay.
[33:16.680 --> 33:18.200]  Wow, that's just deceptive.
[33:19.500 --> 33:20.680]  What the hell was that noise?
[33:21.560 --> 33:21.860]  I don't know.
[33:21.940 --> 33:22.380]  Be careful.
[33:22.740 --> 33:23.200]  Oh, fuck.
[33:23.280 --> 33:23.640]  Run back.
[33:23.860 --> 33:24.080]  Oh!
[33:25.420 --> 33:25.840]  Nice.
[33:28.020 --> 33:28.440]  Whoa.
[33:29.920 --> 33:30.920]  Well, that wasn't very nice.
[33:31.120 --> 33:33.440]  That surely doesn't keep happening, does it?
[33:34.060 --> 33:35.200]  Is this fire gonna burn me?
[33:35.260 --> 33:35.920]  It has to be one and done.
[33:36.300 --> 33:36.960]  Doesn't look like it.
[33:38.680 --> 33:40.360]  I wouldn't stand in it.
[33:41.100 --> 33:41.780]  I thought I had another one.
[33:41.780 --> 33:42.480]  Unless you got marshmallows.
[33:44.460 --> 33:45.420]  Maybe a hot dog.
[33:45.600 --> 33:46.480]  Get a hot dog going.
[33:50.430 --> 33:52.050]  Death by mosh pit has a great question.
[33:52.130 --> 33:53.370]  Why is there no death counter burn-in?
[33:55.030 --> 33:55.150]  Oh!
[33:59.800 --> 34:00.180]  Oh!
[34:01.160 --> 34:01.920]  Okay, okay.
[34:02.320 --> 34:03.160]  Oh, they're dicks.
[34:03.560 --> 34:04.160]  I ain't really no kidding.
[34:04.660 --> 34:05.500]  You dickheads!
[34:05.900 --> 34:07.780]  I'm coming for you, you cock!
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.240]  I don't know why I'm chasing him.
[34:20.880 --> 34:24.500]  Okay, let's regain control of the potential.
[34:24.760 --> 34:25.100]  Walk back in.
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.000]  Okay.
[34:27.800 --> 34:28.620]  You all right?
[34:29.720 --> 34:30.540]  I don't think so.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.920]  I'm not a doctor, but I don't think so.
[34:34.220 --> 34:35.540]  Okay, so that's gonna swing.
[34:36.480 --> 34:36.880]  Yeah.
[34:37.240 --> 34:39.080]  And then that's gonna swing the other way.
[34:40.120 --> 34:41.260]  So do I want to run?
[34:42.100 --> 34:42.800]  You got a bear trap.
[34:43.940 --> 34:45.660]  Yeah, but it's gonna swing to the right, isn't it?
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.700]  There's one on each side, just so you know.
[34:49.860 --> 34:50.620]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[34:50.840 --> 34:51.420]  Right, okay.
[34:52.980 --> 34:55.260]  They're probably gonna go straight down, or do you just have to...
[34:55.820 --> 34:56.880]  I can't duck.
[35:04.010 --> 35:05.710]  Well, what causes them to fall?
[35:07.190 --> 35:07.930]  Good question.
[35:08.270 --> 35:09.410]  Probably you running by them.
[35:09.730 --> 35:11.190]  So I can sprint, right?
[35:11.430 --> 35:14.830]  The one on the right will swing potentially over my head to the left,
[35:14.830 --> 35:17.950]  but the other one is gonna swing into my back side.
[35:18.810 --> 35:21.110]  Yeah, so you gotta... maybe you just have to keep it going
[35:21.110 --> 35:23.870]  and then try not to jump on like that next bear trap.
[35:24.010 --> 35:24.170]  Okay.
[35:28.310 --> 35:29.070]  Well, nope.
[35:30.730 --> 35:31.410]  That's four.
[35:31.830 --> 35:32.650]  Yeah, that is four.
[35:35.450 --> 35:38.210]  I mean, you might as well learn what you can learn here.
[35:38.270 --> 35:39.050]  I just don't know.
[35:39.390 --> 35:40.960]  I mean, you go right and then left and then...
[35:42.430 --> 35:42.810]  Yeah.
[35:43.810 --> 35:44.690]  No, you gotta...
[35:46.370 --> 35:47.070]  That's five.
[35:48.510 --> 35:51.290]  I think you gotta keep going, but it's up to you.
[35:51.390 --> 35:53.470]  If you feel like restart, you know, you gotta learn.
[35:53.770 --> 35:54.630]  We're here to learn.
[35:55.790 --> 35:59.450]  So do I tease that?
[36:00.270 --> 36:02.210]  Tease that, and then as soon as it's gone, keep running.
[36:02.970 --> 36:03.570]  Just keep going.
[36:08.330 --> 36:09.330]  Keep going. Go, go, go.
[36:09.390 --> 36:10.710]  Okay, there you go.
[36:10.990 --> 36:11.230]  Whoops.
[36:11.450 --> 36:11.630]  Nope.
[36:12.030 --> 36:12.330]  No.
[36:14.570 --> 36:16.690]  Well, at least you thought about it in mid-air, I guess.
[36:22.010 --> 36:22.650]  That's six.
[36:23.330 --> 36:23.870]  That's six.
[36:24.530 --> 36:25.490]  That is six.
[36:25.670 --> 36:25.990]  I can keep going.
[36:26.490 --> 36:27.290]  I'll do a bit of learning.
[36:28.070 --> 36:29.710]  Yeah, let's do a little bit of learning here.
[36:30.090 --> 36:31.290]  How many learnings do I get?
[36:32.350 --> 36:34.610]  I think I give you a couple more learnings, but not a lot.
[36:34.730 --> 36:39.010]  Because I just know we're gonna have to come back here and watch you do this.
[36:39.110 --> 36:41.050]  And so the faster that goes...
[36:45.500 --> 36:45.940]  Oh.
[36:47.260 --> 36:49.440]  Did I just steal a stick from him? What was that?
[36:50.600 --> 36:51.600]  I didn't notice.
[36:56.720 --> 36:57.760]  I didn't see anything.
[36:59.080 --> 36:59.760]  Good jump.
[37:00.920 --> 37:01.700]  Doing great.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.660]  Let's learn about this and then start again.
[37:08.880 --> 37:09.520]  Oh, shit.
[37:09.740 --> 37:09.900]  Okay.
[37:11.220 --> 37:15.200]  So Gavin lost all five of his lives 12 minutes into the hour-long video.
[37:22.600 --> 37:23.740]  All right, I'm ready.
[37:24.820 --> 37:25.320]  I'm ready.
[37:25.320 --> 37:26.200]  You got it.
[37:26.860 --> 37:27.620]  Come on, son.
[37:28.600 --> 37:29.180]  Come on.
[37:32.240 --> 37:33.560]  Oh, I went too early.
[37:34.900 --> 37:35.660]  I went too early.
[37:35.660 --> 37:36.640]  Checking to see if you're ready, Phil.
[37:36.760 --> 37:37.120]  You ready?
[37:37.640 --> 37:38.620]  Checking to see if you're ready.
[37:38.860 --> 37:39.000]  All right.
[37:39.720 --> 37:40.720]  There you go. He's helping you out.
[37:41.380 --> 37:42.180]  Getting you up there.
[37:43.520 --> 37:44.180]  New game.
[37:44.500 --> 37:44.880]  Wow.
[37:45.140 --> 37:45.400]  All right.
[37:45.640 --> 37:46.280]  Final run.
[37:46.420 --> 37:47.140]  Final run of the stream.
[37:47.760 --> 37:48.880]  Final run of the stream, guys.
[37:48.880 --> 37:50.020]  We'll be running to 5-0-1.
[37:50.700 --> 37:52.480]  Yep. We're locking in.
[37:52.540 --> 37:52.960]  This is it.
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.200]  I think he reaches as far as he did last time.
[37:55.420 --> 37:55.840]  What do you mean?
[37:56.480 --> 37:56.920]  Really?
[37:57.000 --> 37:57.300]  Why?
[37:58.100 --> 37:59.840]  Yeah, I think you died before that five times.
[38:00.260 --> 38:00.540]  Oh.
[38:01.000 --> 38:01.300]  No.
[38:01.680 --> 38:02.960]  So you're not saying like it's a time thing.
[38:03.000 --> 38:04.480]  You think I'm just gonna lose it.
[38:05.500 --> 38:06.640]  I think you're gonna lose it.
[38:06.840 --> 38:07.060]  Yeah.
[38:07.320 --> 38:08.500]  Impatience will get me sloppy.
[38:09.300 --> 38:09.960]  I think so.
[38:13.160 --> 38:14.540]  Thinking a little too fast.
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.180]  I feel like all the learning takes me three deaths.
[38:23.480 --> 38:24.340]  Yeah, I get it.
[38:24.460 --> 38:25.300]  I get that.
[38:28.330 --> 38:30.330]  Have you gone back to Verdansk yet, Gavin?
[38:31.250 --> 38:32.590]  Yeah, it seems to be all different.
[38:33.610 --> 38:34.010]  Really?
[38:34.930 --> 38:38.070]  Like, I couldn't find any of the places we used to go.
[38:39.270 --> 38:39.950]  Oh, that's too bad.
[38:41.830 --> 38:43.070]  Do you think you'll hop back in?
[38:44.750 --> 38:45.490]  Uh, yeah.
[38:45.670 --> 38:46.630]  I'll probably check it out.
[38:48.210 --> 38:50.270]  I had a feeling that they would change it.
[38:52.170 --> 38:53.430]  Disappointed to hear that was right.
[38:54.910 --> 38:57.530]  I'm trying to recapture some old magic with new magic.
[38:57.650 --> 39:01.350]  But when new and old mix, sometimes you get gammy magic.
[39:02.490 --> 39:04.250]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:04.530 --> 39:08.130]  That's why you need to buy the Silent Bobskin to fill the hole in your heart.
[39:09.510 --> 39:11.330]  Talk about gammy magic, man.
[39:11.490 --> 39:11.790]  Jeez.
[39:17.180 --> 39:18.500]  It's a nice little boat ride.
[39:19.800 --> 39:20.580]  Pretty peaceful.
[39:21.840 --> 39:22.180]  That's right.
[39:22.220 --> 39:24.340]  Amongst all the chaos in this game, I'm glad you can die.
[39:24.420 --> 39:25.420]  Nice little boat ride.
[39:25.420 --> 39:26.800]  It's like a break too soon.
[39:28.240 --> 39:31.640]  Yeah, and between that and then getting spun up by spiderwebs.
[39:31.760 --> 39:32.300]  It's a lot of...
[39:32.300 --> 39:32.620]  Yeah, it's true.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.500]  Do you think an influencer is going to post that's how they start their morning at 4 a.m.?
[39:38.500 --> 39:40.260]  Yeah, definitely spiderwebs.
[39:49.610 --> 39:50.490]  Hopping along.
[39:51.330 --> 39:52.210]  Zero deaths.
[39:53.490 --> 39:54.470]  So far, yeah.
[40:05.070 --> 40:05.890]  Avoided it.
[40:06.430 --> 40:07.790]  Better than the last run.
[40:08.010 --> 40:08.150]  Yep.
[40:08.530 --> 40:09.670]  Last one, I lost one there.
[40:10.830 --> 40:12.170]  Sooner than my previous run.
[40:16.370 --> 40:21.650]  See, the issue with the stuff I've learned is that I get complacent and sloppy and she.
[40:23.170 --> 40:25.430]  I was about to ask how long, like...
[40:26.270 --> 40:27.270]  Do you think this...
[40:27.270 --> 40:28.790]  What the hell?
[40:29.010 --> 40:29.870]  What's going on?
[40:30.330 --> 40:30.890]  Gavin!
[40:31.810 --> 40:33.170]  What was I doing?
[40:33.530 --> 40:34.770]  What are you doing?
[40:35.090 --> 40:35.970]  Complacent and shitty.
[40:36.530 --> 40:37.230]  I was...
[40:37.230 --> 40:42.010]  I was just freaking jumping up and down like a metal trampoline.
[40:42.450 --> 40:43.490]  This is insane.
[40:43.750 --> 40:46.070]  You're really bad at the rope swing stuff, it appears.
[40:46.330 --> 40:47.330]  I hate the swinging stuff.
[40:47.930 --> 40:48.270]  Yeah.
[40:49.430 --> 40:52.390]  Do you think this knowledge will stick with you by the time we do this again?
[40:53.050 --> 40:55.090]  Yeah, if we do it again tomorrow morning.
[40:59.130 --> 41:00.510]  Yeah, when will we do this again?
[41:00.610 --> 41:01.430]  When everyone's back?
[41:03.010 --> 41:05.310]  Yeah, I think Geoff is probably going to want to see you do this.
[41:12.250 --> 41:12.690]  Yeah.
[41:12.690 --> 41:13.110]  This is fine.
[41:14.370 --> 41:15.590]  This is fine.
[41:17.010 --> 41:17.170]  Yeah.
[41:17.910 --> 41:18.630]  It's great.
[41:19.290 --> 41:19.770]  You got it.
[41:19.830 --> 41:20.850]  You're flying right now, dude.
[41:21.150 --> 41:21.710]  Zero deaths.
[41:23.610 --> 41:24.790]  Zero deaths, yeah.
[41:27.230 --> 41:30.450]  Honestly, the thing you've struggled the most with is this little rope jump right there.
[41:30.550 --> 41:31.430]  Well, it sucks.
[41:31.550 --> 41:32.050]  That's why.
[41:32.930 --> 41:33.150]  Yeah.
[41:39.480 --> 41:42.780]  It's been a lot of time trying to drown myself in that box during the first round.
[41:45.860 --> 41:50.980]  So, Andrew, do you remember ahead where I'm about to die or are you just blind?
[41:50.980 --> 41:52.340]  No, I don't remember any of this game.
[41:52.540 --> 41:53.980]  I'm just watching, I'm observing.
[41:54.760 --> 41:57.460]  I'm locking in for my eventual playthrough alongside you.
[41:58.500 --> 41:59.160]  You're in it with me?
[42:00.000 --> 42:00.620]  I'm in it with you.
[42:00.620 --> 42:03.780]  Well, it's one of the achievements I'm missing and you're doing all the hard parts.
[42:09.050 --> 42:09.450]  Yeah.
[42:09.650 --> 42:14.390]  Some of this so far is execution, but a lot of it is just knowing what the trap is.
[42:14.630 --> 42:14.810]  Yeah.
[42:22.470 --> 42:23.290]  Good drop down.
[42:23.650 --> 42:24.450]  Oh, look at you.
[42:26.270 --> 42:28.710]  That looked like someone who knew what they were doing was playing.
[42:28.970 --> 42:29.490]  Pretty sure did.
[42:31.390 --> 42:34.590]  I really appreciate that you doubled down on this for extra length.
[42:35.690 --> 42:35.990]  What do you mean?
[42:36.910 --> 42:38.110]  Well, you can just jump so far.
[42:38.210 --> 42:40.450]  I don't think you need the box as well as the...
[42:40.450 --> 42:41.550]  Oh yeah, it's just what I'm used to.
[42:41.630 --> 42:42.530]  You're just very thorough.
[42:42.530 --> 42:42.830]  I don't like change anymore.
[42:48.330 --> 42:50.070]  You're flying right now, dude.
[42:52.630 --> 42:54.450]  Okay, spite of time.
[42:56.750 --> 42:58.490]  You're getting through this like crazy.
[43:01.110 --> 43:03.810]  He's pretty slow on this part though, but maybe he'll...
[43:04.470 --> 43:06.310]  Nah, this part's gonna be fast.
[43:06.390 --> 43:06.730]  He's gonna...
[43:08.890 --> 43:09.570]  Let's see.
[43:11.010 --> 43:12.010]  There you go.
[43:13.290 --> 43:14.170]  That's one.
[43:15.670 --> 43:16.410]  That's one.
[43:17.730 --> 43:19.010]  Go get that bear trap.
[43:23.880 --> 43:24.440]  God.
[43:24.960 --> 43:25.880]  I'm still holding my breath.
[43:26.080 --> 43:26.600]  That felt close.
[43:27.600 --> 43:27.880]  Yeah.
[43:29.160 --> 43:30.100]  Every time.
[43:30.460 --> 43:31.280]  It's so stressful.
[43:34.280 --> 43:35.380]  Oh my god.
[43:35.680 --> 43:36.560]  Now move the trap.
[43:37.560 --> 43:38.160]  You got it.
[43:38.240 --> 43:38.640]  Easy.
[43:39.120 --> 43:39.320]  You're doing so well.
[43:39.680 --> 43:40.560]  Look at how fast he's doing it.
[43:40.600 --> 43:41.300]  Look at how fast.
[43:42.100 --> 43:42.760]  Get him again.
[43:46.020 --> 43:46.440]  Oh.
[43:47.460 --> 43:47.880]  Perfect.
[43:48.540 --> 43:49.080]  Watch out, watch out.
[43:49.500 --> 43:50.400]  The third one's crazy.
[43:50.860 --> 43:51.400]  There you go.
[43:57.790 --> 43:59.050]  Oh, good job, Gat.
[43:59.190 --> 44:00.190]  Okay, a little too far.
[44:00.530 --> 44:01.150]  A little too much.
[44:01.410 --> 44:02.150]  A little too many beans.
[44:05.930 --> 44:06.730]  Hell yeah.
[44:07.010 --> 44:07.530]  Trap breaks.
[44:08.270 --> 44:09.270]  You go on through.
[44:10.290 --> 44:11.830]  Oh wow, I feel like I went a bit...
[44:11.830 --> 44:13.870]  He could have run me over as he left there.
[44:16.350 --> 44:17.870]  All right, how many deaths are we on?
[44:18.710 --> 44:19.110]  Zero.
[44:19.310 --> 44:19.510]  Zero.
[44:19.750 --> 44:19.930]  Okay.
[44:21.050 --> 44:23.370]  I feel like that was a bad question to ask in this moment.
[44:24.250 --> 44:25.510]  I feel like that's gonna get your crap.
[44:29.210 --> 44:33.950]  God, there's all that stuff later in the game with like the electricity and the gravity going sideways and all that.
[44:34.590 --> 44:34.990]  What?
[44:35.230 --> 44:35.750]  Remember that?
[44:39.490 --> 44:41.250]  Yeah, we go some places in this game.
[44:41.690 --> 44:42.070]  Damn.
[44:48.810 --> 44:49.970]  Big Bubba Chuggalug.
[44:50.190 --> 44:51.050]  Thanks for the sub.
[44:51.870 --> 44:53.830]  That's what you're saying this spider's name was.
[44:54.990 --> 44:56.190]  Big Bubba Chuggalug.
[44:56.510 --> 44:58.570]  Big Bubba Chuggalug, you got me.
[44:59.250 --> 45:00.770]  Oh, you're trying to get the achievement?
[45:00.990 --> 45:02.070]  Let me wrap you up.
[45:09.120 --> 45:10.520]  I ain't waiting for him to leave.
[45:18.240 --> 45:20.100]  I didn't enjoy that ball bit.
[45:21.880 --> 45:22.660]  Yeah, I get that.
[45:24.160 --> 45:25.000]  It seems stressful.
[45:28.550 --> 45:31.210]  You didn't even know that you could jump the first time you were here.
[45:31.370 --> 45:31.790]  I know.
[45:32.250 --> 45:33.330]  It took some learning, didn't it?
[45:33.470 --> 45:33.850]  So far.
[45:35.070 --> 45:36.410]  That's what we're here for.
[45:37.610 --> 45:38.490]  Get those reps.
[45:38.750 --> 45:39.130]  Ah!
[45:39.570 --> 45:41.530]  Oh, shit, Gavin.
[45:42.630 --> 45:43.730]  Oh, my God.
[45:44.530 --> 45:48.250]  I'm so glad that you invented this game and that it landed on you.
[45:50.290 --> 45:53.130]  I didn't want to spin the goddamn wheel that episode.
[45:53.290 --> 45:54.830]  I just thought we could come up with the wheel.
[45:55.150 --> 45:56.130]  Suddenly, I'm spinning it.
[45:56.830 --> 45:58.470]  Everyone's yelling at me for not having a second wheel.
[45:58.550 --> 46:00.290]  I don't want to spin that goddamn thing yet.
[46:00.490 --> 46:00.790]  Ah!
[46:01.570 --> 46:02.830]  Whoa, there you go.
[46:03.230 --> 46:03.550]  Great.
[46:05.370 --> 46:07.710]  Maybe you just need to yell more while you're playing this game.
[46:08.330 --> 46:08.710]  Yeah.
[46:21.200 --> 46:23.460]  Okay, a little tease it.
[46:23.900 --> 46:24.220]  Yeah.
[46:24.700 --> 46:25.600]  A little micro tease.
[46:29.780 --> 46:30.840]  You got this.
[46:31.100 --> 46:31.800]  Oh, look at you.
[46:31.920 --> 46:33.080]  You're so locked in.
[46:33.600 --> 46:34.500]  You're flying, dude.
[46:35.060 --> 46:36.060]  I think you're going to beat this.
[46:37.080 --> 46:38.180]  All the way? All the way to the end?
[46:38.960 --> 46:39.140]  Yep.
[46:39.340 --> 46:41.400]  You're nearly done and the spider just showed up.
[46:42.780 --> 46:46.560]  I wonder how many more hours of us doing this until I get it.
[46:47.800 --> 46:50.920]  I mean, if you keep it up at this pace, this might be the run.
[46:51.420 --> 46:52.380]  Yeah, this could be it, dude.
[46:52.740 --> 46:54.080]  We might never do this again.
[46:54.600 --> 46:56.940]  I think you have like 13 or 14 minutes to beat the whole thing.
[46:57.020 --> 46:57.680]  You got it.
[46:59.740 --> 47:00.220]  Get me out.
[47:01.160 --> 47:01.620]  Get up.
[47:01.840 --> 47:03.240]  Oh, a bunch of stuff landed in my mouth.
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.820]  In an instant, Scaven, if we run out of time, quick resume becomes a great friend of yours.
[47:08.360 --> 47:09.020]  Oh, wow.
[47:09.140 --> 47:10.780]  Yeah, I didn't even think about that.
[47:15.200 --> 47:15.920]  Hey, look, it's a guy.
[47:16.240 --> 47:17.480]  Oh, no, you got tricked again.
[47:19.160 --> 47:19.800]  Oh, God.
[47:23.740 --> 47:26.520]  At least that time you didn't go, what am I?
[47:26.560 --> 47:26.840]  What am I?
[47:26.900 --> 47:27.300]  What am I?
[47:29.860 --> 47:31.300]  Did the bear trap land upside down?
[47:32.160 --> 47:32.380]  Yep.
[47:34.060 --> 47:36.460]  Oh, why do I keep holding A?
[47:36.500 --> 47:37.560]  You gotta swing a little bit.
[47:37.660 --> 47:39.640]  I know, I keep holding it for some reason.
[47:41.120 --> 47:43.700]  There's something about that rope that reminds me of sausages.
[47:44.040 --> 47:46.140]  Yeah, it's a very nunchucky rope, isn't it?
[47:46.500 --> 47:46.760]  Yep.
[47:54.120 --> 47:55.040]  Oh, OK.
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.760]  This bit was fine last time.
[47:57.840 --> 47:58.660]  Yeah, you did great.
[47:59.840 --> 48:02.800]  Just remember something swings down and then you got to ride one out.
[48:03.160 --> 48:03.960]  Oh, yeah, there's this part.
[48:04.100 --> 48:05.440]  Oh, this was really close.
[48:06.500 --> 48:06.660]  Go.
[48:07.680 --> 48:08.980]  Oh, my God.
[48:09.340 --> 48:12.060]  It might be closer that time than it was the first time.
[48:12.100 --> 48:12.520]  That's crazy.
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.120]  Oh, wow, that's early.
[48:15.560 --> 48:16.500]  Holy shit.
[48:17.180 --> 48:18.260]  And a jump.
[48:19.200 --> 48:20.120]  Oh, my God.
[48:22.740 --> 48:23.120]  Wow.
[48:23.560 --> 48:24.040]  Uh-oh.
[48:24.200 --> 48:27.120]  We got some Q versus Columbo action here.
[48:27.220 --> 48:29.020]  Hey, hey, calm down.
[48:30.820 --> 48:31.980]  They're all puffed up at each other.
[48:32.080 --> 48:34.640]  Oh, is Meg trying to fight one of the cats?
[48:34.980 --> 48:35.260]  No.
[48:36.560 --> 48:38.060]  Which one's Meg, Q or Columbo?
[48:41.940 --> 48:43.120]  I only know Shmi.
[48:43.840 --> 48:45.100]  And I only know Shmi mode.
[48:47.340 --> 48:48.640]  I think he'll bite you this year.
[48:49.700 --> 48:50.380]  I think this is the year.
[48:50.420 --> 48:51.660]  No, no, no, no.
[48:51.680 --> 48:52.180]  We're friends.
[48:57.690 --> 48:58.490]  There you go.
[48:59.690 --> 49:01.430]  Oh, shit, I figured it out.
[49:05.450 --> 49:05.970]  Jump.
[49:06.530 --> 49:08.410]  And I remember they said a tire after you.
[49:09.450 --> 49:10.730]  Yep, that is true.
[49:13.730 --> 49:14.590]  Not yet.
[49:16.390 --> 49:16.910]  I hear it.
[49:17.850 --> 49:18.370]  Easy.
[49:20.730 --> 49:22.530]  It's very Tom Cruise jump, that jump.
[49:22.910 --> 49:23.170]  Yeah.
[49:24.990 --> 49:27.730]  I've been saying that you're like the Tom Cruise of regulation.
[49:30.170 --> 49:32.290]  Oh, God, what happened?
[49:32.510 --> 49:34.050]  Can I jump over it down there?
[49:34.870 --> 49:35.850]  I think you can.
[49:35.930 --> 49:37.090]  He just it just didn't.
[49:44.980 --> 49:46.580]  OK, get ready for the second.
[49:52.580 --> 49:53.700]  Where it is.
[49:54.260 --> 49:54.980]  Come on, then.
[49:55.160 --> 49:55.760]  Where is it?
[49:55.800 --> 49:56.200]  Right now.
[49:57.820 --> 49:58.220]  There you go.
[49:58.460 --> 50:00.100]  See, perfect.
[50:00.460 --> 50:02.920]  Bastards cost me a death.
[50:05.180 --> 50:06.380]  Hey, well, we got him down.
[50:06.480 --> 50:07.500]  He's got four more.
[50:10.920 --> 50:12.500]  Are the cats still fighting or what?
[50:13.520 --> 50:15.140]  No, one of them pissed off.
[50:15.220 --> 50:15.320]  Good.
[50:16.920 --> 50:19.060]  And then Smee pissed in your room?
[50:20.140 --> 50:21.200]  Not that I know of.
[50:22.620 --> 50:23.360]  Could have happened.
[50:24.400 --> 50:24.840]  Zero.
[50:25.800 --> 50:30.060]  OK, you remember what to do?
[50:30.220 --> 50:30.380]  Yep.
[50:36.880 --> 50:37.820]  I've done it wrong.
[50:42.600 --> 50:45.980]  I thought that if I just kept going, I might outrun it.
[50:47.520 --> 50:48.220]  That's two.
[50:53.330 --> 50:54.210]  OK, perfect.
[50:54.410 --> 50:54.530]  There you go.
[50:55.010 --> 50:55.270]  Nice.
[50:55.530 --> 50:56.630]  Son of a bitch.
[50:57.230 --> 50:58.070]  What a pointless death.
[50:58.170 --> 50:59.550]  See, this is give me that.
[50:59.630 --> 51:00.190]  Yeah, give me that.
[51:01.210 --> 51:01.430]  Nope.
[51:02.070 --> 51:03.730]  I wonder if you can go fast enough.
[51:03.770 --> 51:04.510]  Can you do that?
[51:04.830 --> 51:05.830]  Get up there.
[51:06.110 --> 51:06.270]  Cool.
[51:08.250 --> 51:09.010]  Two deaths.
[51:09.650 --> 51:10.510]  Yeah, you're good.
[51:11.030 --> 51:11.890]  Two deaths.
[51:12.310 --> 51:14.370]  And further than ever, Andrew said you couldn't even make it here.
[51:14.430 --> 51:14.830]  That's true.
[51:14.890 --> 51:15.310]  I was about to say.
[51:15.330 --> 51:16.830]  You're here in record time, dude.
[51:18.110 --> 51:18.790]  Oh, God.
[51:22.480 --> 51:22.820]  Jump.
[51:25.560 --> 51:25.940]  Wow.
[51:31.780 --> 51:33.340]  So when does he do it?
[51:35.200 --> 51:35.800]  I don't know.
[51:38.640 --> 51:40.460]  Is he going to like tease it first?
[51:41.320 --> 51:41.680]  Yeah.
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.880]  Oh, I don't think I don't like you.
[51:44.020 --> 51:44.580]  Oh, you better.
[51:44.700 --> 51:45.320]  You better go.
[51:47.340 --> 51:48.380]  What do I do?
[51:48.620 --> 51:51.640]  Do you think he hits it hard enough?
[51:51.700 --> 51:52.520]  He might not hit it.
[51:52.700 --> 51:55.540]  Do I have to like stand where he's going to attack me and then run?
[51:55.940 --> 51:57.380]  It might be because then he goes.
[51:57.660 --> 51:58.020]  OK.
[51:59.720 --> 52:00.060]  Try.
[52:02.700 --> 52:04.180]  I mean, I don't know what else to do.
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.220]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[52:06.300 --> 52:09.220]  So maybe as soon as he touches it, you have to just do it.
[52:09.220 --> 52:11.180]  Maybe I stand here, right?
[52:11.640 --> 52:13.660]  And then as it goes up, I'll sprint.
[52:14.900 --> 52:15.680]  Yeah, try.
[52:18.880 --> 52:19.280]  Nope.
[52:19.600 --> 52:19.960]  Nope.
[52:20.360 --> 52:20.760]  Nope.
[52:21.400 --> 52:21.800]  Nope.
[52:22.300 --> 52:23.180]  I think you have to...
[52:23.180 --> 52:23.460]  There's four.
[52:23.760 --> 52:25.700]  I think you have to stand on the end of it.
[52:25.780 --> 52:28.360]  And when he just touches down on it, you have to go.
[52:28.520 --> 52:30.620]  I just felt like it wasn't that much of a bang.
[52:30.700 --> 52:31.980]  I thought it was going to give me some more beans.
[52:32.540 --> 52:33.040]  I agree.
[52:33.160 --> 52:33.660]  I just don't...
[52:33.660 --> 52:36.480]  I think that's just the maximum beans you get on it, man.
[52:36.480 --> 52:37.120]  All right.
[52:40.520 --> 52:43.920]  I'll just have him hold it down for me and I'll just run.
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.480]  Like that's doable, right?
[52:48.160 --> 52:49.820]  No, but I don't think he steps on it hard.
[52:49.920 --> 52:50.840]  I think you have to...
[52:50.840 --> 52:52.060]  I think you have to be on the end.
[52:52.120 --> 52:52.840]  I think you have to.
[52:55.180 --> 52:56.700]  See, there's no...
[52:56.700 --> 52:57.700]  There's no...
[52:57.700 --> 52:58.140]  Can you go under?
[52:58.240 --> 52:58.660]  Can you go under?
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.080]  Die, fuck!
[53:02.400 --> 53:02.940]  Keep going.
[53:03.020 --> 53:03.280]  Keep going.
[53:03.380 --> 53:04.620]  We need to know how to beat this part.
[53:05.320 --> 53:06.460]  I think that's four anyway.
[53:07.100 --> 53:07.720]  You still have room.
[53:08.020 --> 53:08.980]  Pretty sure that was five.
[53:09.220 --> 53:09.480]  That was five.
[53:09.680 --> 53:09.900]  Oh, really?
[53:10.340 --> 53:10.700]  Yeah.
[53:11.340 --> 53:11.700]  Okay.
[53:11.960 --> 53:14.160]  Well, just don't do it again.
[53:14.620 --> 53:16.380]  We just need to know how to get past this part though.
[53:16.480 --> 53:16.700]  All right.
[53:16.700 --> 53:19.000]  So you're saying I just stand on the end and then jump when he...
[53:19.000 --> 53:19.660]  I don't know.
[53:19.720 --> 53:20.280]  I guess so.
[53:20.820 --> 53:21.420]  Just... yeah.
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.340]  I think you just got to like...
[53:26.430 --> 53:29.870]  I think maybe you stand there and then when he presses down on you, you got to run and go.
[53:30.350 --> 53:31.350]  Yeah, but I don't know, man.
[53:34.130 --> 53:34.990]  Oh, that was it!
[53:35.390 --> 53:36.150]  That was it!
[53:36.450 --> 53:36.950]  Why did you keep going?
[53:37.130 --> 53:38.030]  Why did you keep going?
[53:38.090 --> 53:38.570]  You stopped!
[53:38.570 --> 53:40.870]  I didn't think I was going to do it.
[53:40.870 --> 53:41.550]  So you stopped?
[53:43.530 --> 53:45.090]  I didn't think I was going to do it.
[53:45.150 --> 53:46.990]  So I made sure I definitely didn't.
[53:49.490 --> 53:49.890]  Six.
[53:50.870 --> 53:51.210]  Yep.
[53:52.330 --> 53:52.950]  I'm fine.
[53:53.010 --> 53:54.610]  We'll just keep playing until the end of the stream.
[53:54.610 --> 53:55.830]  We'll just learn until 5.01.
[53:56.130 --> 53:56.970]  Yeah, exactly.
[53:59.430 --> 54:00.210]  God damn it.
[54:00.650 --> 54:02.650]  So you'll be just on the other side of the crux.
[54:03.030 --> 54:03.890]  I think that's two.
[54:04.570 --> 54:06.170]  Yeah, I think it's got to be there.
[54:06.430 --> 54:07.490]  And then he presses...
[54:07.490 --> 54:07.710]  Go!
[54:08.010 --> 54:08.450]  Yep, go.
[54:09.230 --> 54:10.070]  You did not jump.
[54:10.070 --> 54:10.970]  You didn't press the jump button.
[54:11.410 --> 54:15.890]  So if I go too fast, I like hop over the bit I need to jump from.
[54:17.590 --> 54:19.390]  Yeah, I mean, I think you just didn't press jump, right?
[54:24.160 --> 54:26.800]  Is that your body from the previous run or was that always...
[54:27.560 --> 54:28.040]  No, I don't know.
[54:28.100 --> 54:28.660]  It might be.
[54:38.020 --> 54:40.020]  All right, so if I'm like on this part...
[54:40.780 --> 54:41.840]  I just don't think...
[54:41.840 --> 54:44.540]  You're saying that you get launched and I don't think it's that.
[54:44.600 --> 54:45.460]  No, I don't think I get launched.
[54:45.620 --> 54:46.400]  I just think I'm gonna...
[54:50.160 --> 54:50.700]  Okay.
[54:51.940 --> 54:53.820]  You gotta press that jump button.
[54:58.400 --> 55:04.590]  It's an interesting thing where it's like he needs to fail his ways before he's able to...
[55:06.340 --> 55:06.600]  Yeah.
[55:06.760 --> 55:07.160]  Oh no!
[55:11.980 --> 55:15.920]  Yeah, my issue seems to be when I press jump,
[55:16.020 --> 55:18.060]  my feet are already off the ground because of that little hump.
[55:20.960 --> 55:21.840]  All right, walk me through it.
[55:21.880 --> 55:22.860]  I'll do exactly what you say.
[55:22.940 --> 55:23.240]  Let's go.
[55:24.100 --> 55:25.780]  I just think you have to be...
[55:25.780 --> 55:27.340]  You have to get enough momentum to run.
[55:27.500 --> 55:29.840]  So you have to be just on the other side of the crux, like right there.
[55:30.660 --> 55:30.940]  Nope.
[55:31.340 --> 55:32.140]  That's way too...
[55:32.140 --> 55:32.320]  Nope.
[55:32.780 --> 55:33.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:33.280 --> 55:34.120]  You gotta be like that.
[55:34.220 --> 55:36.500]  And then he presses it and you gotta like run and go.
[55:37.520 --> 55:38.040]  There you go.
[55:38.040 --> 55:38.940]  You gotta just keep holding right.
[55:39.060 --> 55:39.460]  That's it.
[55:39.820 --> 55:39.940]  Yeah.
[55:40.460 --> 55:41.880]  Yeah, you just weren't running and jumping.
[55:42.340 --> 55:43.740]  Yeah, well, I was trying.
[55:46.180 --> 55:46.500]  Okay.
[55:49.380 --> 55:49.700]  Oh.
[55:50.340 --> 55:50.960]  Oh, no.
[55:52.160 --> 55:52.520]  Ah!
[55:52.720 --> 55:53.380]  Oh, no!
[55:55.260 --> 55:55.620]  Uh...
[55:56.880 --> 56:00.300]  Oh, you gotta go and then run left and hide like against that wall.
[56:03.120 --> 56:04.080]  Can you go on the other side?
[56:04.800 --> 56:05.140]  Oh, shit.
[56:05.320 --> 56:05.700]  Oh, god!
[56:05.840 --> 56:06.600]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[56:07.760 --> 56:09.620]  Do you think you just hide to like the side of the...
[56:09.620 --> 56:09.940]  Oh, yeah.
[56:10.240 --> 56:10.980]  Oh, whoa, whoa.
[56:11.260 --> 56:11.900]  There you go.
[56:12.100 --> 56:12.320]  Boom.
[56:12.500 --> 56:12.760]  Nice!
[56:13.880 --> 56:15.140]  This spider's an idiot, dude.
[56:15.620 --> 56:16.560]  Fuck that spider.
[56:17.040 --> 56:17.280]  Yep.
[56:24.370 --> 56:25.270]  You're crushing it.
[56:25.390 --> 56:26.130]  You're flying right now.
[56:26.710 --> 56:28.230]  You're making good progress.
[56:28.550 --> 56:28.850]  Yep.
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.460]  Seeing if there's like a hidden hat in there or something.
[56:36.880 --> 56:38.780]  Yeah, like a gnome or something.
[56:39.600 --> 56:39.900]  All right.
[56:41.360 --> 56:42.280]  A gnome.
[56:46.840 --> 56:47.300]  Shit.
[56:47.480 --> 56:47.900]  Whoa!
[56:48.980 --> 56:49.240]  Okay.
[56:49.400 --> 56:49.740]  You can slide.
[56:50.560 --> 56:51.100]  Oh, god!
[56:51.260 --> 56:51.620]  It's a titanfall.
[56:52.180 --> 56:52.860]  Oh, shit.
[56:53.620 --> 56:54.580]  What are you doing?
[56:54.800 --> 56:55.660]  The cat just jumped to the left.
[56:55.660 --> 56:56.240]  It's all over my...
[56:57.760 --> 56:58.600]  It's the stream.
[56:58.700 --> 56:59.900]  The stream goes off early.
[57:00.000 --> 57:00.860]  The cat jumped on it.
[57:01.420 --> 57:01.620]  Yeah.
[57:02.720 --> 57:03.520]  Which cat?
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.440]  Oh, that was a Q.
[57:08.600 --> 57:08.980]  It was Fatboy.
[57:09.540 --> 57:10.160]  Got it.
[57:10.560 --> 57:12.860]  What do you do here?
[57:13.660 --> 57:14.600]  Pull his leg off.
[57:14.720 --> 57:14.900]  What?
[57:15.260 --> 57:15.920]  Oh, shit.
[57:18.780 --> 57:20.220]  Yo, this spider sucks.
[57:22.080 --> 57:23.340]  Give me that.
[57:24.600 --> 57:25.200]  Give me this.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.180]  Oh, do you really?
[57:26.420 --> 57:27.040]  Oh, that's nutty.
[57:27.480 --> 57:28.440]  Give me that, you bastard.
[57:29.240 --> 57:30.240]  Now what you got?
[57:30.860 --> 57:31.940]  Now you're just a bull.
[57:32.540 --> 57:33.600]  You're just a bull.
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.240]  It's just a flesh wound.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.460]  You're just... you're simply a ball.
[57:38.340 --> 57:39.860]  I'm the king of spider.
[57:44.940 --> 57:45.440]  Okay.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.360]  Nice. Roll it all the way in there.
[57:49.180 --> 57:50.960]  Rolling a spider towards 501.
[57:55.020 --> 57:55.520]  Beautiful.
[58:00.100 --> 58:00.840]  There you go.
[58:03.020 --> 58:03.400]  Skewered.
[58:03.940 --> 58:04.320]  Perfect.
[58:04.740 --> 58:05.620]  Not a kid's game, really.
[58:05.840 --> 58:06.000]  Nice.
[58:06.720 --> 58:07.680]  Not really, no.
[58:09.720 --> 58:10.420]  Hey, congrats.
[58:10.460 --> 58:12.320]  You passed the 15 minute mark of this video.
[58:12.500 --> 58:14.460]  Oh, so I'm a core of the way through the game?
[58:14.860 --> 58:15.840]  Yeah, dude, you're flying.
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.480]  I think the bird's gonna be mean to you.
[58:18.600 --> 58:19.440]  Is he gonna drop that on me?
[58:20.280 --> 58:20.660]  Probably.
[58:21.360 --> 58:22.200]  Oh, he didn't.
[58:22.300 --> 58:22.500]  Okay.
[58:26.970 --> 58:28.610]  At least the spider's done with.
[58:30.670 --> 58:32.250]  Yeah, they'll never show up again.
[58:37.540 --> 58:38.940]  Get out of here, bird.
[58:39.680 --> 58:40.480]  That's my box.
[58:40.580 --> 58:41.280]  Yeah, we hate you.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.100]  Oh, god.
[58:53.320 --> 58:53.500]  Oops.
[58:54.500 --> 58:55.180]  A bit too eager.
[58:55.220 --> 58:55.760]  It's doing great, really.
[59:02.090 --> 59:03.550]  I mean, this is all easy stuff.
[59:06.250 --> 59:08.090]  45 minutes of this, no problem.
[59:08.630 --> 59:09.110]  It's simple.
[59:09.890 --> 59:10.730]  Oh, a bit of water.
[59:11.590 --> 59:12.710]  Head grub thing.
[59:12.890 --> 59:14.470]  Oh, I forgot about this.
[59:14.530 --> 59:15.510]  They're gonna make me go all gammy.
[59:16.930 --> 59:17.950]  What is this?
[59:20.310 --> 59:21.750]  What do these do?
[59:22.090 --> 59:25.110]  I think they make you just constantly walk in the same direction until you...
[59:26.170 --> 59:26.390]  Oh.
[59:34.620 --> 59:35.500]  That's crazy.
[59:35.720 --> 59:36.120]  Sorry, sir.
[59:36.380 --> 59:37.880]  A bit disrespectful of the dead there.
[59:40.340 --> 59:42.380]  Bouncing his face off of the beach.
[59:43.440 --> 59:44.240]  Oh, geez.
[59:46.220 --> 59:49.840]  Hey, I dare you to jump down there, son.
[59:51.040 --> 59:53.460]  Why double-dog dare you to do it before I do?
[59:54.700 --> 59:56.120]  Is there time for me to get out?
[59:56.480 --> 59:57.580]  Or do I need to push something on it?
[59:57.680 --> 59:58.280]  Let me get a body.
[59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.060]  Oh, can you throw a body on it?
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.540]  Oh, he threw a rock at me, the bastard.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.320]  Oh, damn. What the hell?
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.140]  Becoming disrespectful to the dead.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:08.680]  Yep.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.280]  Let me push one via the ass, scraping his face off.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.000]  We're so close to 5.01, guys.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.600]  We've almost made it to the best time of the week, 5.01.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.220]  Thanks for sticking with us on a very weird Friday stream.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.500]  Really appreciate it.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.120]  Just trying to get a stain up here.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:25.940]  Yep.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.320]  Drop him in.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:31.920]  Boom.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:32.380]  Nice.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.120]  All right.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.800]  There's your head, Grub.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.520]  That's my word.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.380]  What if I leave soon?
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:40.840]  Oh.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.320]  What?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.700]  I thought it puts a Grub on me.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.880]  That's how the Grub comes off, I think.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.780]  I guess maybe it happens later.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.380]  It's like the de-Grubber.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:50.920]  Oops.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.900]  5.01 on a Friday.
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.500]  Congratulations, everyone.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:00:59.980]  Way to go, guys.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:00.760]  You made it.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.460]  And so did we.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.420]  Good job.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.680]  Yeah, that was great.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.160]  It's the second one.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.820]  The button will be...
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.060]  Boy, it looks like it, doesn't it?
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.180]  It could be an inverse one.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.400]  Boom.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:14.660]  It was.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.320]  Hey, it was an inverse one.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.240]  And he's dead.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.940]  Yeah, Gavin, you want to call it?
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.540]  What do you want to do?
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.900]  I mean, it's 5.01, buddy.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.760]  That was a good amount of run.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.060]  I feel like we've learned a lot.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:30.640]  We've learned a lot.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.160]  I'm excited for you to do this for real.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.540]  I would say I've got the first 25% down.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.160]  Locked in.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:37.740]  Locked in.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.780]  I just gotta keep doing this
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.960]  until my brain retains enough of it.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.160]  Oh, imagine if I was doing it.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.260]  The part that you really need to be stressed about is the spider log thing.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.620]  I think that's just the thing you're struggling with.
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.420]  Well, I'm panicking.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.560]  I think what I'm really gonna struggle with is the fact that if this was my 2015 brain,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.580]  I think I'd be a lot better.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.600]  Oh, is that right?
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.040]  Damn.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:04.120]  Tough.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.840]  Oh, yeah, do it.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:07.520]  Shoot me.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.340]  Shoot me.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.520]  Well, hello.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.060]  They shot you.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.680]  All right.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.280]  Easy as that.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.480]  Thanks for watching that, Stram.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.700]  Yep, appreciate you guys stopping by.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.920]  Don't forget, you can watch this on Tuesday.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.280]  All of other VODs go up like that.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.640]  So thanks for being here and we'll see you next Friday.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.460]  But check out the podcast.
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.300]  Check out the Patreon.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.280]  Check out our gameplays.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.440]  We'll see you next time.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.320]  Bye.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.200]  Have an excellent weekend.
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.180]  Bye now.
