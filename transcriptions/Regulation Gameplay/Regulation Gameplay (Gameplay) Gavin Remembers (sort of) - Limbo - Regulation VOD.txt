[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  Hey, guess what, stream? Guess what? I messed everything up.
[00:05.340 --> 00:10.400]  Shocking, I know. But at least the chat wasn't funny about it at all the whole time. Guys,
[00:10.600 --> 00:16.960]  welcome! It's Friday, we're working on to 5.01, the best time of the week. And what's the best
[00:16.960 --> 00:24.580]  way to get this going? Is it truly Gavin seeing what he learned last time in Limbo and putting
[00:24.580 --> 00:32.380]  it into practice here for you on a Friday? I sure hope it is. It's me, Eric. I'm here with
[00:32.380 --> 00:38.160]  Gavin, Andrew, and Nick. We're hanging and banging. We are getting on towards 5.01. Guys,
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.580]  how you doing today? I'm hanging and banging, so I'm good. Who are you banging?
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.360]  I was just like, you know, it's just like, you know, yeah, yeah, just being like,
[00:48.360 --> 00:54.620]  we're banging these piss rats out of the chat. You make it away for corn cats.
[00:55.140 --> 00:59.340]  Let's see a wall of piss rats and maybe a wall of idiot flags for breaking the stream,
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.940]  and then I'll get up and get going. It's not your fault, unless you set the thing to two,
[01:04.020 --> 01:08.680]  then it is your fault. But I'm chalking it up to game glitching, computer glitching.
[01:09.100 --> 01:16.060]  A lot of people opting for the idiot flag. Yeah, sure is a lot of that, but way too many piss
[01:16.060 --> 01:21.060]  rats. Should be more corn cats, honestly, than piss rats, for being completely honest. They're
[01:21.060 --> 01:27.520]  better, smarter. But either way, now is the time for Gavin to put everything into use. Gavin,
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.880]  how much do you remember from the last time you played Limbo? Well, instead of 10 years,
[01:32.940 --> 01:38.660]  it's been about two weeks, so that's nice. I got that going for me. Upgrade. And I think I remember
[01:38.660 --> 01:42.680]  how to do the log jump with the spider. Oh, that's good. You're gonna hit the jump button,
[01:42.680 --> 01:49.340]  right? Yeah, there's a lot of jumping to be done. Good. Oh, shit. Okay, and let's start a
[01:49.340 --> 01:54.420]  new game. Let's get it going from the beginning. Feeling good, guys. Welcome to the stream. That's
[01:54.420 --> 02:00.200]  how easily you can die. Mulligan. That's a mulligan from the very beginning. Let's try it
[02:00.200 --> 02:07.600]  again, boys. Have you played this game before, Nick? No. Okay. What I've retained from two weeks
[02:07.600 --> 02:14.540]  ago is not the memory of the levels, but the impatience that I have. Yeah, that I think is
[02:14.540 --> 02:21.980]  gonna be your downfall. Yeah, I'm already impatient. Propunknown86 gifted subs. Oh,
[02:22.120 --> 02:30.240]  my God. JohanBach10. What? What? I read it as Propunknown, and you read it as Propunknown.
[02:30.360 --> 02:36.060]  Yeah. Or own. There you go. Either way, thank you so much. JohanBach10 gifted. Thank you so much,
[02:36.060 --> 02:41.420]  guys. Appreciate everyone coming through, stopping by this Friday. It's great. We love seeing you
[02:41.420 --> 02:45.960]  here. Thank you so much, guys. Appreciate everyone coming through, everyone stopping by,
[02:46.080 --> 02:53.940]  all of the bits, everything that's going on on this Friday. I'm excited to watch Gavin win this
[02:53.940 --> 02:59.500]  whole game. HollyJollyPocket10 gifted. This is out of control already. Thank you so much. They
[02:59.500 --> 03:06.500]  all believe in you, Gavin. Gavin, we all believe in you. Let's do it. Do it for the people.
[03:07.980 --> 03:12.100]  I'm doing it for the people in the chat, especially CrucifiedDonkey. Yeah,
[03:12.780 --> 03:16.220]  CrucifiedDonkey. Thank you very much. God, I love Twitch. You can name yourself anything,
[03:16.480 --> 03:23.060]  and then you get CrucifiedDonkey. CrucifiedDonkey? Awesome. He has... Can you imagine
[03:23.060 --> 03:30.500]  how difficult it would be to crucify a donkey? Oh, God. It must take so much time. It would take
[03:30.500 --> 03:34.960]  probably eight people to do that. Theoretically, it could be painless, right? Because the hooves,
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.180]  I assume there's a lot of like... Well, you know, like horses. And what about horses?
[03:41.940 --> 03:45.080]  Well, their hooves, they're very... Like, they don't feel anything with the hooves. They can
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.420]  just chop a bunch of the hooves off when they're doing stuff. Well, that's like saying you don't
[03:48.420 --> 03:52.920]  feel your fingernails. I'm sure you'd still hurt if a nail went through it, though. I've never
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.940]  trimming my nails and going, ah! What if someone had a giant, rusty nail through it? No, if I had
[03:59.940 --> 04:06.680]  a four-foot nail and you put a nail through the nail, I don't think it would be painful at all.
[04:08.020 --> 04:12.740]  Well, I'll leave it to Zeke Hardshaft, who gifted 10 subs. You can let us know if it would be easy
[04:12.740 --> 04:19.660]  to crucify a donkey. Zeke Hardshaft. Zeke Hardshaft is like a Bond curl. Yeah, it's awesome.
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.120]  Oh, look at this. Yeah, Gavin knows all these tricks now. Gavin's got all this shit locked in,
[04:28.160 --> 04:36.660]  dude. Here he goes. Look at him go. I don't know. What did this kid do to get this lot in life?
[04:37.560 --> 04:42.660]  Probably died. I would assume that he's dead. So is this...
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.020]  Is this purgatory? Limbo? Or is this hell? I would think it's probably limbo.
[04:48.740 --> 04:53.220]  Mmm. Somewhere in between? Oh, heck. And razzle-dazzle with the gifted also,
[04:53.360 --> 04:55.880]  I would think it's probably in between heaven and hell. I think it would be limbo.
[04:56.740 --> 05:05.980]  Nick? Hmm. Thought? I thought this was inside. Whoops. Same company. Anyway. Inside limbo.
[05:06.400 --> 05:11.820]  Inside limbo. What system is this on? This is on my Xbox. Crazy.
[05:11.820 --> 05:19.540]  Uh, there's a channel point bet that you can go on right now if you're watching live. How many
[05:19.540 --> 05:26.100]  deaths before 430 central time? And your options are less than 5, 5 to 10, 20, 10 to 20, or 20
[05:26.100 --> 05:33.540]  plus. Wow. Dude, if you're betting 20 plus, damn. I already got one down, so. That's true. That is
[05:33.540 --> 05:40.560]  true. The mulligan there? Didn't count. Mulligan definitely counted. We're not doing another
[05:40.560 --> 05:51.680]  session of what does and doesn't count. Yeah. We're in a real Andrew versus Gavin era. Oh my
[05:51.680 --> 05:55.540]  God, guys, wait until some of these episodes that are coming out. If you want to hear just
[05:55.540 --> 06:01.440]  25 minutes arguing. Oh, it's so good. It was great. It's a two person podcast. It's so good.
[06:01.620 --> 06:07.660]  I full on, I was at a 10. I was at a 10 all the way. I assume you feel the same way, Gavin. While
[06:07.660 --> 06:13.160]  we're in that going back and forth, I'm really like, there's no love lost. There's no, like,
[06:13.220 --> 06:17.840]  I'm not actually mad at you. It's just like, we end the recording and I immediately think,
[06:18.160 --> 06:21.960]  ah, that was great. That was so fun. And you know who's really going to like that? I can tell you
[06:21.960 --> 06:26.960]  right now, cause they just gifted 10. Juggs McTuggs. Oh, thank you Juggs McTuggs. Another
[06:26.960 --> 06:34.580]  bond girl. Juggs McTuggs is going to be loving these episodes when they come out. We will have
[06:34.580 --> 06:40.980]  Tottenham in the semifinals. Is that good? Yeah. Semifinals of what? Of what? I don't know.
[06:41.300 --> 06:44.600]  It doesn't even matter. I think them in the semis is probably good.
[06:46.660 --> 06:52.240]  Damn. Is this the bottom? Oh boy. I don't know why you dropped there. That was nuts.
[06:52.400 --> 06:54.920]  That fell. That was a bit of a risk, wasn't it? Yeah. Yes, it was. Yes, sir.
[06:56.020 --> 07:00.140]  Reliant B with the gifted. This is great. Everyone's going crazy today. The rats are out.
[07:01.880 --> 07:08.400]  The rats are out. I keep forgetting I don't need this box over here for this bit, but I always use it.
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.380]  That's okay. Yeah, you get a little bit more range. It's like a cautious thing, I think. It is, yeah.
[07:14.920 --> 07:20.020]  That feels a bit long. You need to go further, buddy. He thinks you could use the box some more.
[07:23.420 --> 07:24.600]  I just didn't want to...
[07:27.280 --> 07:32.060]  Shit. Wow. Shit me backwards. Did you guys see this? Crazy.
[07:33.760 --> 07:35.220]  Shit. Put that in my reel.
[07:38.120 --> 07:42.460]  Reel of what is what I wonder. What reel is that going? Is that the highlight? Is that...
[07:43.340 --> 07:47.200]  Just the no death reel, baby. The fucking highlights.
[07:47.980 --> 07:50.700]  Alongside the wheel is the reel. Yep.
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.900]  Go to second reel. Go to second reel.
[07:56.320 --> 07:58.880]  Look at this thing. My prick.
[08:00.920 --> 08:05.940]  Look, he's like gravitating towards you. Yeah, he's gonna put it through me.
[08:07.080 --> 08:11.020]  Uncle Kai with the gifted subs. This is great. Oh, thank you.
[08:19.960 --> 08:28.660]  Oh, are you gonna... Oh, my God. Just relaxed. You all right? Very close. Yeah. Killing it.
[08:31.040 --> 08:34.120]  I don't remember where we got to last time.
[08:35.520 --> 08:40.360]  M1914 gifted subs as the spider is getting played with by the fly.
[08:42.820 --> 08:44.340]  I am the fly.
[08:45.860 --> 08:49.340]  I'm the spider. He's not as mad as I thought he would be.
[08:52.160 --> 08:53.940]  That was really gooey sounding.
[09:03.410 --> 09:08.190]  I don't feel like I've seen a goo movie in a long time. I don't think they make goo movies anymore.
[09:09.470 --> 09:12.270]  Somethings was gooey. I didn't see that.
[09:12.710 --> 09:16.210]  All right. That's fair. I missed it. I missed the goo movie.
[09:16.210 --> 09:19.970]  Yeah. Guys, does anyone remember this bit? What's happening?
[09:20.410 --> 09:24.790]  Yeah, keep going. Yeah, you keep going and then you get... You get webbed up.
[09:24.970 --> 09:27.630]  Remember? Oh, yeah.
[09:29.430 --> 09:36.370]  That, yep, is the exact... Yep, Gavin will give it a meeting that makes Eric very uneasy.
[09:36.790 --> 09:36.930]  Oh, yes.
[09:36.930 --> 09:44.250]  It's just like... There's no confidence behind it. I need an... I'm asking a question not for my sake.
[09:44.850 --> 09:46.110]  And it is just like...
[09:46.110 --> 09:47.530]  Oh, okay. This is bad.
[09:47.690 --> 09:48.230]  Are you stuck?
[09:49.350 --> 09:49.670]  Yeah.
[09:49.830 --> 09:51.430]  Yeah, it's supposed to... This happens.
[09:51.630 --> 09:52.110]  Oh, okay.
[09:54.710 --> 09:58.310]  I feel like you would have liked me less at, um, meetings at our old job.
[09:58.630 --> 09:59.910]  Uh, I don't doubt that.
[10:00.710 --> 10:02.370]  Why? What was the difference?
[10:04.230 --> 10:05.570]  Uh, like it wouldn't have been there.
[10:05.670 --> 10:14.220]  Yeah. Like... I don't know, man. Like, that's fine. You just can't...
[10:16.050 --> 10:16.090]  Yeah, actually...
[10:16.090 --> 10:22.650]  Like, you know, like, half the meeting today. Um, you know, generic according.
[10:22.710 --> 10:28.490]  Thank you so much for the gifted. Appreciate you. Um, yeah, again, I'm just asking questions
[10:28.490 --> 10:32.450]  because I need to make sure of stuff so that way we can move forward as a business of five people.
[10:33.210 --> 10:35.850]  Yeah, I mean, for our company, I'm all about it.
[10:35.950 --> 10:37.930]  Exactly. I definitely feel like it is, yeah.
[10:38.450 --> 10:40.210]  But the other company, I was busy.
[10:41.390 --> 10:42.450]  I don't doubt that.
[10:42.450 --> 10:47.070]  I had to make the, uh, the play pals and all that.
[10:47.350 --> 10:48.510]  Yeah, yeah, we don't do that.
[10:49.250 --> 10:54.790]  Sorry, I couldn't come to any meaning. I had to make the play pals and all that.
[10:56.090 --> 10:59.110]  We would often do that. Like, if there was a meeting, Michael and I would just pop into
[10:59.110 --> 10:59.970]  the room and make a plate.
[11:00.990 --> 11:07.710]  Dude, 100 bits from Kweefer Sutherland. Thank you so much. Thank you, Kweefer Sutherland.
[11:10.470 --> 11:13.650]  I forgot about that jump.
[11:13.970 --> 11:19.790]  What, you did great. You're doing so good. Back, yeah. There you go, there you go.
[11:19.850 --> 11:21.870]  Yeah, well, look at this. Look at this.
[11:21.870 --> 11:24.170]  Yeah, see? He learned. You're like halfway there, right?
[11:24.170 --> 11:26.730]  You have no idea how many deaths. There were so many deaths at this point, you know?
[11:28.330 --> 11:31.610]  It's weird, it's like your brain doesn't remember, but your hands do.
[11:31.970 --> 11:32.210]  Yeah.
[11:37.630 --> 11:39.310]  Don't you have, like, a little hand brain?
[11:39.850 --> 11:40.870]  I think so, yeah.
[11:40.910 --> 11:41.550]  Like a sub, a sub-brain.
[11:41.550 --> 11:42.930]  Sub-unit, substation.
[11:43.290 --> 11:46.650]  Now, if you put a nail into your hand brain, now that would be painful.
[11:47.150 --> 11:48.550]  Nah, call me the crucified donkey.
[11:48.930 --> 11:52.910]  He died for nothing.
[11:57.470 --> 11:58.970]  I would love to get out of this web.
[11:59.230 --> 12:00.710]  You're almost there. You're almost there.
[12:02.530 --> 12:04.810]  How do you free yourself from the web?
[12:06.530 --> 12:07.450]  Oh, shit.
[12:07.890 --> 12:08.370]  One.
[12:11.850 --> 12:15.530]  People are saying that Gavin's louder than us in Discord.
[12:15.750 --> 12:16.850]  I don't know if that's something you want to turn down.
[12:17.050 --> 12:18.750]  I also don't care if you don't want to, that's fine.
[12:19.510 --> 12:20.630]  Oh, let me, let me change it.
[12:20.830 --> 12:22.410]  Don't die. Pause the game.
[12:23.150 --> 12:23.450]  Oh, shit.
[12:26.070 --> 12:28.010]  Probably want to do one thing at a time.
[12:28.250 --> 12:30.050]  Probably want to do one fucking thing at a time.
[12:30.310 --> 12:33.570]  Crucified donkey, 10 gifted subs.
[12:34.060 --> 12:39.130]  The audio getting corrected is dedicated to oh my morgues and crucified donkey.
[12:39.390 --> 12:40.690]  Crucified donkey coming through big style.
[12:40.850 --> 12:42.770]  Yeah, big morgues.
[12:44.050 --> 12:45.050]  Crucified donkey.
[12:47.730 --> 12:51.170]  That was Shrek, but that was spaffy clams.
[12:51.470 --> 12:53.610]  That's something that Gavin would say in a recording.
[12:53.610 --> 12:55.330]  Spaffy clams sounds like one of my worms.
[12:55.450 --> 12:55.630]  Yeah.
[12:55.950 --> 12:57.330]  That's got to be my next worm too.
[12:57.810 --> 12:58.710]  Her cousin was octopus.
[12:58.850 --> 13:00.310]  Crucified donkey and spaffy clams.
[13:03.770 --> 13:04.490]  There you go.
[13:06.490 --> 13:07.430]  Look at his eyes.
[13:07.650 --> 13:08.230]  I'm awake.
[13:08.490 --> 13:09.150]  He's awake.
[13:10.310 --> 13:10.990]  I'm alive.
[13:11.050 --> 13:12.890]  Okay, one death here is not ideal.
[13:13.510 --> 13:14.690]  No, it's fine.
[13:15.090 --> 13:15.690]  You're halfway there, right?
[13:15.810 --> 13:18.390]  When you die in limbo, I guess you just come back is the answer.
[13:18.650 --> 13:18.850]  Yeah.
[13:19.730 --> 13:20.130]  Ow.
[13:20.770 --> 13:21.530]  Are you all right?
[13:22.090 --> 13:22.330]  Oh.
[13:24.110 --> 13:25.930]  They're no longer in limbo, I don't think.
[13:26.050 --> 13:26.950]  I think they're out of limbo.
[13:27.550 --> 13:29.710]  Do I jump on the thing and jump off?
[13:30.290 --> 13:30.790]  Is that what I did?
[13:31.450 --> 13:32.690]  You had to like tease it, I think.
[13:33.570 --> 13:35.290]  If you die in limbo, you just go to hell?
[13:35.790 --> 13:36.110]  Or what?
[13:38.030 --> 13:38.950]  I don't know.
[13:38.970 --> 13:39.290]  I don't know how that works.
[13:40.450 --> 13:41.410]  Well, where's that person?
[13:42.530 --> 13:43.510]  A great question.
[13:43.930 --> 13:45.470]  I don't think that's a person, is it?
[13:45.510 --> 13:46.430]  I think it's a fake person.
[13:46.870 --> 13:48.010]  Oh, it's a fake person?
[13:48.210 --> 13:49.030]  I thought so.
[13:49.070 --> 13:49.790]  That's the way I read it.
[13:49.870 --> 13:51.390]  Zeke Hardshaft with another 10 gifted.
[13:52.750 --> 13:55.130]  Zeke Hardshaft coming on strong.
[13:55.750 --> 13:56.530]  Okay, maybe not.
[13:56.550 --> 13:57.830]  Zeke and donkey on this stream.
[13:58.050 --> 13:59.450]  Maybe don't say coming.
[14:00.950 --> 14:03.070]  Zeke Hardshaft versus crucified donkey.
[14:04.690 --> 14:05.950]  Whoever wins, we lose.
[14:09.870 --> 14:10.930]  Nice, there you go.
[14:12.850 --> 14:14.970]  Do a little, do a little, and then come back.
[14:15.350 --> 14:16.230]  Just run back, do I?
[14:16.230 --> 14:17.150]  Yeah, I think that's what it is.
[14:17.350 --> 14:18.270]  A little snap and then run.
[14:18.510 --> 14:19.270]  You give it a little go.
[14:19.330 --> 14:20.490]  I think you got to get a little bit deeper.
[14:20.730 --> 14:21.050]  There you go.
[14:21.170 --> 14:21.690]  Yeah, you do.
[14:22.990 --> 14:23.570]  A little deeper.
[14:24.310 --> 14:24.710]  There you go.
[14:24.950 --> 14:25.210]  A little deeper.
[14:25.210 --> 14:26.050]  You gotta like jump on it.
[14:26.250 --> 14:26.650]  Yeah, and then you go.
[14:26.710 --> 14:26.930]  There you go.
[14:27.070 --> 14:28.010]  Oh, go, go, go!
[14:28.750 --> 14:29.310]  Nicely done!
[14:29.450 --> 14:30.350]  There you go, way to go, buddy.
[14:30.950 --> 14:33.730]  Why is everything so much scarier than it was last time?
[14:34.630 --> 14:36.690]  Because you know you're capable of it.
[14:37.450 --> 14:38.260]  There you go.
[14:39.950 --> 14:42.990]  Oh, dude guy, one, oh my god.
[14:43.190 --> 14:43.710]  Great jumps!
[14:44.150 --> 14:47.230]  Dude guy, 12 ZXQ.
[14:47.830 --> 14:49.090]  Holy shit, dude guy.
[14:49.210 --> 14:53.430]  With the 25 gifted and then floppy disc repairman with the five gifted as well.
[14:53.550 --> 14:55.510]  This is getting wild in here.
[14:56.270 --> 14:56.550]  This is what happens.
[14:56.850 --> 14:57.610]  He repaired five discs.
[14:57.670 --> 14:58.070]  That's right.
[14:58.330 --> 14:59.790]  This is what happens when the rats show up.
[14:59.790 --> 15:03.690]  When the regulation listeners come through, but you know it at the heart, they're rats.
[15:03.830 --> 15:04.890]  You just know it.
[15:08.720 --> 15:10.220]  25 gifted is wild.
[15:10.800 --> 15:11.180]  Insane.
[15:11.640 --> 15:11.880]  What?
[15:12.100 --> 15:12.560]  Give me this.
[15:12.920 --> 15:13.600]  That's mine.
[15:15.240 --> 15:16.240]  Come here, you little prick.
[15:16.400 --> 15:17.080]  Come here, you prick.
[15:17.240 --> 15:17.980]  Thanks, Spiderleg.
[15:18.180 --> 15:18.980]  Get it, get back here.
[15:18.980 --> 15:19.800]  That's a fast little prick.
[15:20.120 --> 15:20.300]  Yep.
[15:21.440 --> 15:22.100]  Maybe he drowned.
[15:22.880 --> 15:24.400]  Top hat hero with the five.
[15:24.680 --> 15:26.640]  Gavin is on a tear right now.
[15:27.480 --> 15:28.460]  You're doing really well.
[15:28.940 --> 15:31.640]  Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[15:32.280 --> 15:33.160]  Go, go!
[15:33.220 --> 15:34.380]  Oh, you did it.
[15:35.100 --> 15:36.120]  What a moment!
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.680]  Put that in the reel.
[15:38.200 --> 15:38.920]  That was pretty cool.
[15:39.160 --> 15:39.420]  I forgot.
[15:40.360 --> 15:40.920]  Holy crap.
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.040]  There's your second reel.
[15:42.360 --> 15:42.700]  Five gifted.
[15:42.900 --> 15:43.720]  That was incredible.
[15:43.880 --> 15:45.180]  This reel is getting great.
[15:45.860 --> 15:47.160]  I just went to second reel.
[15:47.420 --> 15:47.740]  Second reel.
[15:48.060 --> 15:49.560]  Oh, I'm excited for the third reel.
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.400]  Is it coming?
[15:53.740 --> 15:54.380]  Is this thing coming?
[15:56.760 --> 15:58.060]  Okay, and then...
[15:58.060 --> 15:58.540]  See that?
[15:59.600 --> 15:59.920]  And then...
[15:59.920 --> 16:00.260]  Way to go.
[16:00.880 --> 16:01.500]  Missed that one.
[16:01.900 --> 16:02.340]  Nice.
[16:03.160 --> 16:03.520]  Okay.
[16:05.680 --> 16:06.400]  Holy shit.
[16:09.720 --> 16:11.020]  My heart's beating, I'll be honest.
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.040]  You're fired up.
[16:12.160 --> 16:12.560]  I can tell.
[16:12.960 --> 16:15.200]  You are, like, as far as you made it last time.
[16:15.540 --> 16:15.680]  And we're only 20 minutes in.
[16:15.680 --> 16:16.480]  Yeah, you're flying, dude.
[16:17.060 --> 16:17.680]  You're flying.
[16:18.280 --> 16:19.200]  Is this where I made it to?
[16:19.720 --> 16:20.980]  You're a little bit further, but yeah.
[16:21.600 --> 16:23.280]  You haven't done the spider jump yet, have you?
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.340]  That's coming up now.
[16:25.720 --> 16:27.600]  And oh my god, I forgot.
[16:28.000 --> 16:28.820]  I hate this bit.
[16:28.940 --> 16:30.760]  Yeah, you just gotta go forward, then go backward, remember?
[16:30.900 --> 16:31.720]  Forward, then backwards.
[16:33.400 --> 16:34.060]  It's easy.
[16:34.980 --> 16:35.420]  Easy.
[16:35.880 --> 16:37.040]  Nice, nice.
[16:37.140 --> 16:37.580]  There you go, see?
[16:40.180 --> 16:42.020]  Forwards, then backwards, then forwards, right?
[16:42.100 --> 16:43.180]  Yes, I think that's right.
[16:43.440 --> 16:45.900]  I think that's right, because that was crazy.
[16:46.300 --> 16:47.520]  That was particularly vicious.
[16:48.060 --> 16:48.260]  Yep.
[16:48.520 --> 16:49.260]  That was...
[16:50.820 --> 16:52.100]  That was some bad advice.
[16:54.580 --> 16:55.760]  That was crazy.
[16:56.640 --> 16:57.380]  Why won't it...
[16:57.380 --> 16:57.600]  Okay.
[16:59.080 --> 16:59.940]  Oh, what?
[17:00.200 --> 17:01.680]  Oh, wait, wait, it didn't split in half.
[17:01.680 --> 17:02.520]  Maybe you're a lot...
[17:02.520 --> 17:02.940]  Oh, you're dead.
[17:04.800 --> 17:05.200]  What?
[17:05.680 --> 17:06.900]  Maybe you'll walk out of it.
[17:07.940 --> 17:08.160]  Yeah.
[17:08.340 --> 17:08.920]  Rub a little dirt in it.
[17:08.980 --> 17:09.500]  Tits up.
[17:09.700 --> 17:11.460]  Yeah, rub a little dirt on it, tuck and roll.
[17:11.620 --> 17:12.180]  You'll be all right.
[17:12.660 --> 17:13.640]  Okay, okay.
[17:13.740 --> 17:14.340]  Oh, nice.
[17:14.800 --> 17:15.140]  Easy.
[17:15.960 --> 17:16.660]  Baby mode.
[17:17.560 --> 17:18.140]  Oh, man.
[17:18.160 --> 17:19.660]  Seek hardshaft with another five gifted.
[17:19.940 --> 17:20.200]  Crazy.
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.520]  All right, you're down to one.
[17:25.000 --> 17:25.800]  You can do it.
[17:26.020 --> 17:28.200]  Wait, that was my fourth death?
[17:29.160 --> 17:29.840]  I believe so.
[17:31.380 --> 17:31.940]  Am I wrong?
[17:32.080 --> 17:32.820]  I thought it was my third.
[17:33.040 --> 17:33.620]  Shit, are you serious?
[17:33.960 --> 17:34.220]  Shit.
[17:35.020 --> 17:35.420]  I don't know.
[17:35.460 --> 17:36.660]  Is Nick counting the mulligan or no?
[17:36.800 --> 17:37.860]  I see fours in chat.
[17:38.880 --> 17:41.220]  Oh, is that four total for the stream or four for this run?
[17:42.740 --> 17:43.600]  Three on this run.
[17:44.080 --> 17:44.500]  Okay, there you go.
[17:45.320 --> 17:46.280]  Three is what I care about.
[17:46.520 --> 17:46.960]  Oh, that's right.
[17:46.980 --> 17:47.320]  I'm sorry.
[17:47.480 --> 17:48.460]  You restarted.
[17:48.860 --> 17:49.300]  That's my...
[17:49.300 --> 17:49.460]  Yeah.
[17:51.640 --> 17:54.720]  I mean, by all means, keep count of the total, but I'm paying attention to the three.
[17:54.840 --> 17:55.140]  Got it.
[17:55.180 --> 17:55.880]  So you got two left.
[17:56.720 --> 17:57.800]  Oh, what am I doing?
[17:58.380 --> 17:59.260]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[17:59.840 --> 18:00.620]  Uh-oh.
[18:02.420 --> 18:03.260]  You can do it.
[18:03.840 --> 18:04.700]  Oh, you got it.
[18:05.280 --> 18:05.760]  Oh, there you go.
[18:06.060 --> 18:09.220]  Oh, now this, Nick, took Gavin so much time.
[18:09.260 --> 18:10.180]  Oh, shit, it's the wrong one.
[18:12.020 --> 18:13.040]  It's the next one.
[18:13.320 --> 18:15.420]  Now, okay, now it's four.
[18:16.940 --> 18:17.520]  Four's good.
[18:17.680 --> 18:18.120]  All right.
[18:18.520 --> 18:18.760]  All right.
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.080]  I'm all mixed up.
[18:23.280 --> 18:24.420]  That was a painful one.
[18:24.960 --> 18:25.600]  That was tough.
[18:25.680 --> 18:26.100]  That one sucked.
[18:27.680 --> 18:28.380]  Not this one.
[18:28.420 --> 18:28.620]  Okay.
[18:28.640 --> 18:28.980]  There you go.
[18:29.620 --> 18:30.020]  Okay.
[18:30.220 --> 18:30.500]  Okay.
[18:31.500 --> 18:31.900]  Okay.
[18:32.280 --> 18:34.220]  Now, this is where I mess everything up.
[18:35.720 --> 18:37.860]  Oh, so he's gonna smack you over.
[18:37.960 --> 18:38.760]  Is that what's going on here?
[18:39.020 --> 18:39.960]  Oh, that's what he thought.
[18:39.980 --> 18:41.080]  He needs to run and jump.
[18:41.160 --> 18:42.560]  He just needs the weight to adjust.
[18:42.860 --> 18:43.080]  Oh.
[18:44.500 --> 18:45.100]  There you go.
[18:45.720 --> 18:46.400]  Good enough.
[18:46.600 --> 18:47.660]  Great job, man.
[18:47.680 --> 18:49.000]  It wasn't perfect, but good enough.
[18:50.120 --> 18:50.720]  You did it.
[18:50.760 --> 18:51.480]  That's all that matters.
[18:51.620 --> 18:51.820]  Yeah.
[18:51.940 --> 18:52.080]  Yep.
[18:52.320 --> 18:52.880]  Still alive.
[18:55.880 --> 18:56.680]  Oh, damn.
[18:57.080 --> 18:58.200]  You flying right now, bud.
[18:58.200 --> 19:00.880]  No, no, you gotta go.
[19:02.020 --> 19:02.620]  I go.
[19:02.780 --> 19:03.320]  I do this, right?
[19:03.400 --> 19:04.700]  Yeah, you start it and then you run.
[19:05.480 --> 19:05.880]  Go!
[19:06.820 --> 19:07.520]  It didn't snap.
[19:07.900 --> 19:08.400]  It didn't go.
[19:08.500 --> 19:08.840]  It didn't give.
[19:09.020 --> 19:09.360]  You gotta break it.
[19:09.560 --> 19:10.020]  You gotta jump.
[19:11.400 --> 19:11.700]  Run!
[19:12.120 --> 19:13.060]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[19:15.560 --> 19:16.560]  And the drop.
[19:17.040 --> 19:17.360]  Yeah.
[19:17.640 --> 19:18.200]  There you go.
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.160]  Yeah.
[19:20.440 --> 19:21.800]  Suck shit, Spidey.
[19:25.640 --> 19:27.980]  Yeah, the two-week gap, it's not good.
[19:28.340 --> 19:29.100]  It's not good.
[19:30.600 --> 19:32.040]  It's very bad.
[19:32.420 --> 19:33.980]  Did you make it this far last time?
[19:34.740 --> 19:35.060]  Yeah.
[19:35.360 --> 19:36.420]  I'm a little past this.
[19:36.700 --> 19:36.940]  Oh.
[19:37.660 --> 19:38.920]  I killed the spider.
[19:39.460 --> 19:40.620]  So you're par for the course, then.
[19:41.500 --> 19:42.840]  But he's making way better time.
[19:43.020 --> 19:44.060]  Crucified Donkey, 10 more gifted.
[19:44.280 --> 19:44.800]  Crucified Donkey?
[19:45.040 --> 19:46.240]  Damn, Donkey dude.
[19:49.320 --> 19:50.620]  The Incredible Donkey.
[19:52.400 --> 19:53.640]  Donked for our sins.
[19:59.130 --> 20:01.330]  Hello, are you friendly?
[20:02.890 --> 20:04.450]  The answer's always no.
[20:05.010 --> 20:05.210]  Yeah.
[20:05.610 --> 20:07.710]  Why are you alive, Spidey?
[20:09.630 --> 20:10.750]  Oh my god.
[20:15.880 --> 20:16.700]  Yeah, I can see the spider.
[20:17.440 --> 20:20.540]  This is an accurate representation of Geoff's current physical health.
[20:20.820 --> 20:21.780]  God, no kidding.
[20:22.060 --> 20:22.820]  What the fuck?
[20:23.060 --> 20:23.960]  Oh my god.
[20:24.820 --> 20:25.460]  Ouch.
[20:26.200 --> 20:26.880]  It's twitching.
[20:31.550 --> 20:34.490]  I thought spiders had two segments.
[20:36.830 --> 20:37.490]  What do you mean?
[20:37.950 --> 20:38.430]  Oh, yeah.
[20:38.430 --> 20:41.450]  Like a thorax and a head part?
[20:41.810 --> 20:41.950]  Yeah.
[20:45.280 --> 20:47.980]  What if it just bit the shit out of you when you rolled?
[20:48.900 --> 20:51.120]  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[20:51.360 --> 20:52.020]  I'm gonna getcha.
[20:52.980 --> 20:54.180]  I'm gonna getcha.
[20:55.860 --> 20:57.540]  Ass-fucking-spider.
[21:01.280 --> 21:02.740]  Okay, bird.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.860]  Does the bird try and kill me?
[21:08.160 --> 21:08.600]  No.
[21:08.780 --> 21:09.240]  Bird.
[21:09.240 --> 21:11.100]  No, he's gotta be nice, right?
[21:11.260 --> 21:12.380]  Bird's always nice.
[21:12.740 --> 21:14.020]  Bird nice. Bird good.
[21:14.140 --> 21:16.580]  Did you see TPG's tweet earlier today?
[21:17.240 --> 21:17.640]  No.
[21:18.060 --> 21:18.740]  No, what'd he say?
[21:19.140 --> 21:19.980]  Seven hours ago.
[21:20.820 --> 21:21.820]  I retweeted it.
[21:22.220 --> 21:25.360]  My buddy told me he thinks we are entering a quote,
[21:25.660 --> 21:28.420]  new dawn of having big birds around,
[21:28.660 --> 21:31.820]  and I've never been closer to embracing my birder destiny.
[21:32.260 --> 21:32.880]  Let's go.
[21:35.680 --> 21:36.780]  It's so good.
[21:37.440 --> 21:39.460]  DudeGuy with another...
[21:39.460 --> 21:40.940]  Wow, 10 gifted.
[21:41.120 --> 21:41.440]  Wild.
[21:41.580 --> 21:42.440]  Oh my god, thank you.
[21:42.620 --> 21:43.360]  Thank you guys so much.
[21:43.360 --> 21:44.020]  Thanks, DudeGuy.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.280]  DudeGuy.
[21:45.660 --> 21:47.740]  Dude, and GDuff with a 10 gifted.
[21:47.740 --> 21:48.320]  What has happened?
[21:48.880 --> 21:49.360]  I don't know.
[21:50.280 --> 21:51.680]  Maybe it's because we're in a quote,
[21:51.800 --> 21:53.280]  new dawn of having big birds around.
[21:55.400 --> 21:55.840]  Damn.
[21:56.040 --> 21:57.540]  I just, I really like it.
[21:57.660 --> 21:59.400]  My friend told me this thing.
[21:59.580 --> 21:59.900]  Yeah.
[22:00.140 --> 22:01.420]  I think that rocks.
[22:01.960 --> 22:02.840]  That is, yeah.
[22:03.120 --> 22:04.300]  The best part, for sure.
[22:04.320 --> 22:04.500]  Yeah.
[22:06.700 --> 22:07.700]  Memory shit again.
[22:07.820 --> 22:08.400]  What's happening?
[22:08.620 --> 22:09.620]  Uh, this, I don't remember you.
[22:09.740 --> 22:11.120]  Oh no, no, you, you were this far.
[22:11.180 --> 22:11.940]  There's like these like worm,
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.120]  it's like the worm guys or whatever.
[22:13.700 --> 22:14.180]  Oh god, am I drowning?
[22:14.180 --> 22:15.020]  Oh yeah, you're gonna get wormed.
[22:15.860 --> 22:16.780]  Are you getting wormed?
[22:17.080 --> 22:17.580]  You a dog?
[22:19.340 --> 22:20.100]  He's about to be.
[22:20.640 --> 22:20.860]  Yeah.
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.160]  I need to get the...
[22:24.160 --> 22:25.860]  Doesn't somebody like run at you or something?
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.060]  Am I an idiot?
[22:28.440 --> 22:28.540]  Oh.
[22:29.200 --> 22:29.740]  Is that water?
[22:29.840 --> 22:30.480]  I thought it was.
[22:30.580 --> 22:32.420]  It is, but I was just climbing to water.
[22:32.700 --> 22:33.240]  Isn't it water?
[22:33.360 --> 22:34.480]  I need, I need the thing.
[22:34.480 --> 22:35.380]  I think so.
[22:37.880 --> 22:38.760]  The thing.
[22:39.020 --> 22:42.040]  Do you think TPG's friend is just Siri?
[22:42.840 --> 22:44.820]  Because it sounds like a thing he would just ask.
[22:44.940 --> 22:47.040]  That sounds like such a TPG statement.
[22:47.980 --> 22:51.280]  Hey Siri, are we in a new dawn of big birds being around?
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.580]  My friend said yes.
[22:55.160 --> 22:57.240]  I don't think there's anything to grab, Gavin, is there?
[22:57.640 --> 23:00.000]  Oh, I just don't remember how to do it then.
[23:00.040 --> 23:00.540]  I don't either.
[23:03.040 --> 23:06.300]  But then Siri comes back with, big bird is a character on Sesame Street.
[23:08.300 --> 23:09.620]  Big bird's in a new era.
[23:11.560 --> 23:12.720]  Can I just make it to that body?
[23:12.940 --> 23:13.700]  I think so, probably.
[23:13.900 --> 23:14.120]  Yeah.
[23:14.500 --> 23:14.720]  Okay.
[23:16.820 --> 23:19.280]  Wow, that's uh...
[23:19.280 --> 23:19.780]  Okay.
[23:20.040 --> 23:20.940]  Yeah, see, here you go.
[23:21.080 --> 23:21.520]  Yeah, this is it.
[23:22.420 --> 23:23.040]  Oh, Worm Brain.
[23:23.720 --> 23:23.940]  Yep.
[23:24.340 --> 23:25.060]  Come here, Worm Brain.
[23:25.400 --> 23:25.640]  Yep.
[23:27.140 --> 23:29.160]  I'm gonna see if I can activate people's Siri's.
[23:29.400 --> 23:30.000]  Hey, Siri!
[23:30.640 --> 23:33.480]  Are we in a new dawn of big birds being around?
[23:35.700 --> 23:36.580]  Text mom.
[23:41.660 --> 23:44.220]  Oh, I need bird brain or bug brain.
[23:44.340 --> 23:44.820]  What was it called?
[23:45.320 --> 23:45.600]  Worm Brain.
[23:47.580 --> 23:48.360]  Bug brain.
[23:49.940 --> 23:50.760]  Bird brain.
[23:51.220 --> 23:51.660]  Bug brain.
[23:51.840 --> 23:52.180]  Come here, son.
[23:52.300 --> 23:52.940]  Oh, fuck it.
[23:55.160 --> 23:57.640]  Painting the, uh, you can't see it, but I'm painting this ramp red.
[23:58.140 --> 23:58.760]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[23:58.760 --> 24:00.300]  Just dragging a face.
[24:00.460 --> 24:02.140]  This is what I want to happen to me after I go.
[24:04.120 --> 24:05.380]  You guys just drag me around.
[24:07.960 --> 24:08.280]  Plonk.
[24:11.640 --> 24:13.680]  All right, this is where I got to last time, I think.
[24:13.800 --> 24:14.300]  Yeah, I think so.
[24:14.940 --> 24:16.400]  Because there was those pressure plates.
[24:17.780 --> 24:18.500]  Oh, a worm thing.
[24:21.200 --> 24:21.900]  It's a jump.
[24:25.060 --> 24:25.380]  Dang.
[24:26.420 --> 24:27.900]  You get too close to that, will it kill you?
[24:30.500 --> 24:31.020]  Don't.
[24:37.040 --> 24:37.560]  Delicious.
[24:38.340 --> 24:39.100]  Yum, yum, yum.
[24:39.960 --> 24:41.240]  Okay, so this one was...
[24:43.180 --> 24:46.580]  The pressure plate is betwe- is, there's two of them, right?
[24:46.840 --> 24:47.640]  And the middle isn't.
[24:48.280 --> 24:49.700]  I believe the, uh...
[24:51.100 --> 24:53.540]  And then the next one is the opposite.
[24:53.760 --> 24:54.140]  Exactly.
[24:54.420 --> 24:56.020]  Where that's the pressure plate.
[24:56.120 --> 24:56.360]  Yep.
[24:56.360 --> 24:58.360]  Because the game's a snake.
[24:58.740 --> 24:58.920]  Yep.
[25:00.280 --> 25:01.240]  And then...
[25:01.240 --> 25:02.300]  And then I don't know.
[25:02.480 --> 25:02.980]  I don't know.
[25:03.060 --> 25:04.820]  I think this might have been as far as you got last time.
[25:05.120 --> 25:06.400]  Wow, and here we are again.
[25:07.260 --> 25:09.680]  And Zeke Hardshaft, 10 gifted.
[25:10.200 --> 25:10.680]  Damn.
[25:11.040 --> 25:11.460]  Damn.
[25:12.340 --> 25:14.920]  His shaft is hard.
[25:15.060 --> 25:15.620]  Rock hard.
[25:16.060 --> 25:16.420]  Turgid.
[25:16.960 --> 25:18.100]  Can I just jump this?
[25:18.600 --> 25:19.080]  Probably.
[25:23.010 --> 25:23.550]  There you go.
[25:24.030 --> 25:24.330]  Oh, wow.
[25:26.190 --> 25:26.950]  Don't do it.
[25:27.810 --> 25:28.490]  Go back.
[25:28.590 --> 25:29.310]  Go back.
[25:31.230 --> 25:32.510]  Just stood there.
[25:32.910 --> 25:33.390]  Well...
[25:34.050 --> 25:35.070]  Was that five?
[25:35.850 --> 25:36.230]  Yeah.
[25:36.390 --> 25:38.630]  Yeah, keep going because you need to see what's further.
[25:38.870 --> 25:40.350]  Well, he can go up to five.
[25:40.630 --> 25:42.230]  Okay, well now he's ruined it.
[25:42.650 --> 25:48.570]  Okay, and he ruined it because it is now 430 and that's six deaths.
[25:49.210 --> 25:53.050]  Okay, so do I go again or do I explore?
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.270]  I think you got to explore.
[25:54.410 --> 25:55.270]  I think you got to keep going.
[25:55.330 --> 25:56.010]  I think you got to keep going.
[25:56.010 --> 25:59.710]  You're not remembering a lot, but you're remembering some and that's helping.
[26:00.410 --> 26:02.630]  Okay, you don't remember shit then, I guess.
[26:03.070 --> 26:05.450]  No, he just bounced off funny that time.
[26:07.690 --> 26:09.430]  Now I'm just ravenous.
[26:10.810 --> 26:11.770]  You're ravenous?
[26:12.470 --> 26:13.610]  That means I'm hungry, doesn't it?
[26:13.670 --> 26:14.850]  Yes, a cannibal.
[26:16.710 --> 26:17.850]  It means I'm a cannibal?
[26:18.150 --> 26:20.630]  Neil McDonough is all ravenous and a cannibal and...
[26:21.250 --> 26:21.650]  And what?
[26:21.690 --> 26:24.170]  That Scottish guy that was in 28 Weeks Later and ravenous.
[26:25.070 --> 26:25.470]  No.
[26:25.710 --> 26:27.710]  It's a movie called Ravenous, it's about cannibals.
[26:28.390 --> 26:29.310]  Oh my god.
[26:29.930 --> 26:31.050]  Oh, get me, get me, keep going!
[26:32.470 --> 26:33.410]  I'm gonna use both, huh?
[26:33.570 --> 26:34.710]  Okay, good, good to know.
[26:36.350 --> 26:37.470]  This is how we keep learning.
[26:38.230 --> 26:38.630]  Yep.
[26:39.190 --> 26:40.210]  This is how we win.
[26:41.090 --> 26:41.390]  Yep.
[26:41.850 --> 26:44.190]  Did you see the full trailer for 28 Years Later?
[26:45.110 --> 26:46.790]  Yeah, I'm so excited.
[26:46.990 --> 26:47.550]  I am too.
[26:48.470 --> 26:49.290]  I think it looks so cool.
[26:50.070 --> 26:51.470]  It is gross to look at.
[26:51.590 --> 26:53.190]  They have achieved what they're trying to achieve.
[26:53.190 --> 26:53.910]  Yeah.
[26:54.530 --> 27:00.490]  I saw that they put in, or they put out 28 Days Later in 4K.
[27:00.670 --> 27:02.630]  But wasn't it shot on like a camcorder?
[27:02.690 --> 27:04.910]  Yeah, it's like a camcorder movie.
[27:06.190 --> 27:08.190]  I don't know, like why, I guess?
[27:08.750 --> 27:12.890]  Like that's like us putting a sound like mini DV shit out right now.
[27:14.970 --> 27:16.570]  They upscaled it for some reason?
[27:16.710 --> 27:17.510]  Why would they, I don't know.
[27:18.450 --> 27:21.790]  I just feel like the vibe of that doesn't really need that resolution.
[27:24.690 --> 27:25.570]  It doesn't.
[27:26.430 --> 27:29.330]  Actually, the uglier it looks, I think the more effective it is.
[27:29.570 --> 27:30.530]  I think so too.
[27:30.710 --> 27:32.530]  For that movie, it's such a frenetic feel.
[27:34.630 --> 27:36.950]  Man, that movie freaked me out, man.
[27:39.670 --> 27:40.390]  Good zombie movie.
[27:40.810 --> 27:41.550]  Good zombie movie.
[27:42.050 --> 27:43.630]  I think they're my favorite zombies.
[27:44.550 --> 27:44.990]  Wow.
[27:45.110 --> 27:45.950]  I think they're the scariest.
[27:46.330 --> 27:49.490]  I would put them at the, it's just because it's so fast, right?
[27:49.550 --> 27:50.170]  It's just so...
[27:50.170 --> 27:52.010]  Yeah, they're so quick and it's just so aggressive.
[27:52.490 --> 27:56.830]  Not even just them, like that's terrifying, but it is also so fast acting,
[27:56.930 --> 27:59.110]  which means as soon as you're hit, you're fucked.
[27:59.210 --> 28:01.190]  It's also just very visually unpleasant.
[28:01.550 --> 28:02.910]  Oh, so unpleasant.
[28:03.370 --> 28:05.210]  It is very visually unpleasant, you are right.
[28:06.070 --> 28:08.210]  Do I need to grab the rope above the grindies?
[28:08.350 --> 28:10.150]  I can't, I can't tell yet, maybe.
[28:10.550 --> 28:11.210]  Oh boy.
[28:12.450 --> 28:13.570]  Oh, you're lowering it, well done.
[28:13.570 --> 28:14.710]  Here you go, here you go, here you go.
[28:14.750 --> 28:15.590]  You got it, you got it.
[28:15.590 --> 28:16.190]  Keep doing your thing.
[28:16.470 --> 28:16.950]  You're doing great.
[28:17.150 --> 28:18.390]  And then is it a race against time?
[28:18.510 --> 28:18.730]  Go!
[28:18.950 --> 28:19.550]  It must be.
[28:22.610 --> 28:24.970]  Oh, well, next round.
[28:26.270 --> 28:27.190]  Do I need it?
[28:27.390 --> 28:27.510]  What?
[28:28.150 --> 28:31.970]  Yeah, you do, because you need to pull it all the way so it opens the next section for you.
[28:32.950 --> 28:33.270]  This?
[28:34.270 --> 28:36.510]  Gavin, look, do you see the thing that was rising on the right?
[28:37.290 --> 28:37.490]  Yeah.
[28:37.810 --> 28:42.310]  So when you pull it, you need to have it go high enough for you to be able to pass this next section.
[28:44.490 --> 28:46.910]  He gets it, look at him, he gets it.
[28:47.610 --> 28:48.990]  Well, I get it, but what do I do with the car?
[28:49.850 --> 28:52.970]  To be close enough to pull the rope if it's going too high?
[28:55.190 --> 28:57.790]  You jump on the cart, then you jump from the cart to the rope.
[28:57.890 --> 28:58.230]  Right.
[28:58.450 --> 28:59.630]  Now he gets it, look at him.
[29:00.950 --> 29:03.930]  I'm not sure what the... go pull the rope down again.
[29:04.090 --> 29:08.090]  Pull the rope all the way down, leave the cart as close... there you go.
[29:08.310 --> 29:10.590]  Yeah, I'm not sure what... it seemed like...
[29:13.350 --> 29:15.250]  It felt explained pretty well.
[29:15.430 --> 29:16.030]  I thought so.
[29:16.970 --> 29:17.730]  He got it.
[29:17.970 --> 29:18.450]  All right, keep going.
[29:18.450 --> 29:19.790]  No, I don't think he did.
[29:20.470 --> 29:21.570]  He definitely did.
[29:21.630 --> 29:22.470]  All right, keep going all the way.
[29:22.550 --> 29:23.130]  All right, now run.
[29:23.230 --> 29:23.930]  Now runsies.
[29:24.190 --> 29:24.930]  Now dropsies.
[29:25.830 --> 29:26.670]  Now jumpsies.
[29:27.330 --> 29:27.670]  Yeah.
[29:28.690 --> 29:30.070]  Okay, now jumpsies.
[29:31.030 --> 29:32.210]  Oh, I let go of it.
[29:32.970 --> 29:33.530]  All right.
[29:33.590 --> 29:33.810]  Great.
[29:36.910 --> 29:37.630]  He's got it.
[29:37.950 --> 29:38.610]  We got it.
[29:39.090 --> 29:39.790]  Yeah, look at him.
[29:40.110 --> 29:40.670]  He's got it.
[29:48.080 --> 29:48.440]  Yeah.
[29:52.260 --> 29:53.420]  Okay, all right.
[29:54.840 --> 29:55.440]  Give me that.
[29:55.700 --> 29:56.140]  Give me that.
[29:56.220 --> 29:56.540]  There you go.
[29:56.600 --> 29:57.040]  This is good.
[29:57.160 --> 29:57.440]  Give me that.
[29:57.660 --> 29:57.820]  Grab it.
[29:57.960 --> 29:58.700]  There you drop.
[29:58.820 --> 29:59.880]  I suck.
[30:02.960 --> 30:03.320]  Almost.
[30:04.300 --> 30:04.900]  He's getting it.
[30:04.900 --> 30:07.140]  I don't know what it is I'm pressing that makes me immediately let go,
[30:07.480 --> 30:08.580]  but I'm glad I'm not doing it up here.
[30:08.880 --> 30:11.800]  Oh, brother.
[30:11.800 --> 30:13.220]  I'm glad I'm not doing it over here.
[30:15.600 --> 30:18.040]  Turns out that's where I did it as well.
[30:20.740 --> 30:21.100]  Suck.
[30:22.600 --> 30:24.300]  I'm glad I didn't go all the way back to the beginning
[30:24.300 --> 30:26.400]  just to lose five deaths on the next bit.
[30:33.100 --> 30:35.140]  There you go on the rope.
[30:36.880 --> 30:37.980]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:38.820 --> 30:39.920]  You're doing so good.
[30:41.200 --> 30:41.560]  Perfect.
[30:47.180 --> 30:47.700]  Come here.
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.240]  Come here.
[30:58.810 --> 31:00.110]  I'm losing it.
[31:09.590 --> 31:11.530]  Okay, I lowered it down.
[31:11.630 --> 31:12.350]  You got it.
[31:14.990 --> 31:15.590]  Oops.
[31:15.850 --> 31:16.210]  I know.
[31:17.170 --> 31:17.970]  Come on.
[31:20.750 --> 31:24.250]  You know what sucks?
[31:24.410 --> 31:26.910]  There's no way when I first played this game.
[31:29.230 --> 31:31.670]  15 years ago that I sucked this much.
[31:31.750 --> 31:34.170]  Oh, I don't think we need to include any of this on the reel.
[31:34.450 --> 31:36.610]  I think we need to skip.
[31:36.750 --> 31:37.310]  Yeah, this is all.
[31:39.870 --> 31:41.530]  I don't think it's very reelable.
[31:41.890 --> 31:44.210]  Go, go, go, go, jump on.
[31:44.450 --> 31:45.950]  Come on, just once.
[31:46.090 --> 31:46.470]  Yes.
[31:48.370 --> 31:49.530]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[31:50.370 --> 31:50.810]  Okay.
[31:51.870 --> 31:53.570]  Yeah, then I'll just swing.
[31:53.730 --> 31:54.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:54.070 --> 31:55.550]  I'll wait for that one to be high enough.
[31:55.930 --> 31:56.170]  Okay.
[31:56.170 --> 32:00.070]  And then I'll try and make it under both before I get crushed to death.
[32:00.110 --> 32:00.530]  That's right.
[32:00.610 --> 32:00.770]  Okay.
[32:01.610 --> 32:02.330]  There you go.
[32:02.910 --> 32:03.190]  All right.
[32:03.350 --> 32:03.830]  All right.
[32:03.990 --> 32:04.430]  All right.
[32:04.530 --> 32:04.910]  About there?
[32:05.070 --> 32:05.190]  No.
[32:05.550 --> 32:06.090]  Oh, you got it.
[32:06.130 --> 32:06.490]  You got it.
[32:06.490 --> 32:06.870]  You got it.
[32:06.950 --> 32:07.270]  You got it.
[32:07.570 --> 32:07.930]  Wow.
[32:11.790 --> 32:12.150]  Okay.
[32:12.970 --> 32:13.350]  Good-o.
[32:13.830 --> 32:14.470]  Not bad.
[32:14.790 --> 32:15.390]  Good-o.
[32:19.880 --> 32:20.500]  What was that?
[32:20.760 --> 32:22.280]  Oh, what was that?
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.200]  Like a little mole-man?
[32:23.620 --> 32:27.800]  I don't know if I want to know about that more.
[32:28.040 --> 32:28.860]  Hans Mole-man.
[32:29.560 --> 32:35.800]  Okay, this is gonna go on my head, and then it makes me go the other way?
[32:36.100 --> 32:36.460]  Is that right?
[32:38.440 --> 32:39.660]  Yeah, there you go.
[32:40.580 --> 32:41.060]  Okay.
[32:42.100 --> 32:43.500]  So you have no control here?
[32:45.180 --> 32:45.660]  Nope.
[32:46.380 --> 32:48.020]  Oh, the light changes direction.
[32:48.160 --> 32:48.360]  Okay.
[32:49.520 --> 32:57.800]  And I can jump, but I can't turn around until I hit another light or a head-eater thing.
[32:57.800 --> 32:59.240]  Oh, eat my head!
[32:59.620 --> 32:59.940]  Eat my head!
[33:00.400 --> 33:00.820]  Eat my head!
[33:01.040 --> 33:01.440]  Turn around!
[33:03.720 --> 33:05.460]  But I need that though, don't I?
[33:06.080 --> 33:07.960]  I think you'll get other ones.
[33:08.280 --> 33:08.960]  I think that's like it.
[33:09.020 --> 33:10.020]  But don't I need it to jump on?
[33:10.100 --> 33:10.800]  Like I've ruined it?
[33:10.860 --> 33:11.840]  I'm just gonna walk straight into the-
[33:11.840 --> 33:12.840]  Yeah, you're dead.
[33:14.060 --> 33:14.700]  Eat me!
[33:14.980 --> 33:15.500]  Eat me!
[33:15.660 --> 33:16.880]  Die, you will die.
[33:17.020 --> 33:17.620]  Die, die, die.
[33:18.380 --> 33:18.740]  Okay.
[33:19.260 --> 33:19.800]  All right.
[33:20.140 --> 33:20.380]  Good.
[33:22.480 --> 33:22.900]  Good.
[33:25.220 --> 33:25.640]  Goot.
[33:26.480 --> 33:27.140]  Ah, yes.
[33:27.260 --> 33:27.560]  Good.
[33:32.500 --> 33:36.280]  Can I just skip this bit if I face the other way real quick?
[33:37.460 --> 33:39.020]  Like before it goes into my brain?
[33:39.900 --> 33:40.280]  I mean-
[33:40.280 --> 33:40.340]  What?
[33:41.240 --> 33:42.420]  Why not? I might as well try.
[33:42.580 --> 33:43.980]  Save a precious couple of seconds.
[33:47.120 --> 33:48.600]  Okie dokie, jumpsy.
[33:49.080 --> 33:49.320]  There you go.
[33:49.360 --> 33:49.640]  There you go.
[33:52.680 --> 33:53.420]  Thank you.
[33:53.520 --> 33:54.360]  Oh no, the light!
[33:55.200 --> 33:56.320]  Worm don't like.
[33:56.500 --> 33:57.540]  Wait, can you-
[33:57.540 --> 33:57.880]  Now.
[33:59.100 --> 33:59.620]  Get it!
[33:59.720 --> 34:00.000]  There you go.
[34:00.080 --> 34:00.480]  Nice!
[34:01.400 --> 34:02.120]  Cheers, pal.
[34:02.120 --> 34:02.780]  Good work.
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.360]  See you in hell, wormy.
[34:09.780 --> 34:10.780]  You tell him, Nick.
[34:10.980 --> 34:11.620]  I got him.
[34:12.440 --> 34:13.860]  Oh, we're getting a little bit industrial here.
[34:14.240 --> 34:14.440]  Sweet.
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.320]  Limbo's really coming up in the world.
[34:20.660 --> 34:21.540]  What is this?
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.340]  Oh, a break.
[34:24.720 --> 34:25.520]  All right.
[34:31.760 --> 34:33.360]  Go on, little bird, eat it.
[34:33.580 --> 34:34.120]  Oh, it's a frog.
[34:35.500 --> 34:37.360]  Or mole thing, or whatever.
[34:41.990 --> 34:43.890]  It likes the little shrooms.
[34:50.700 --> 34:51.620]  Not a mushroom guy.
[34:52.940 --> 34:53.780]  Not a fish at all.
[34:54.480 --> 34:54.960]  No.
[34:55.200 --> 34:55.940]  Any contacts.
[34:56.040 --> 34:56.600]  Don't like it.
[34:57.020 --> 34:59.200]  I love mushrooms.
[34:59.880 --> 35:02.360]  I mean, I'm ambivalent.
[35:02.620 --> 35:04.200]  It doesn't matter to me one or the other, I don't think.
[35:05.800 --> 35:06.680]  Oh, you got him!
[35:07.980 --> 35:08.320]  Oh!
[35:08.740 --> 35:10.160]  You fed the pig man.
[35:11.440 --> 35:12.460]  Did I need to do that?
[35:12.460 --> 35:14.160]  I don't know, you did it.
[35:14.920 --> 35:16.860]  Does it let me go under here?
[35:17.540 --> 35:18.700]  Uh-oh, is it going to eat me?
[35:19.100 --> 35:19.660]  Yep, probably.
[35:19.840 --> 35:21.320]  No, I think you're supposed to run it that way.
[35:21.640 --> 35:21.960]  Oh!
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.560]  Oh, he's like the hamster?
[35:24.000 --> 35:24.920]  Yeah, he's like...
[35:24.920 --> 35:26.460]  Yeah, pretty much he's like the hamster.
[35:27.200 --> 35:29.300]  Everyone's been saying he's like the hamster.
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.160]  Yeah, a lot of people around here have been saying how he is like the hamster.
[35:34.500 --> 35:36.360]  This stream brought to you by G-Force.
[35:37.900 --> 35:38.900]  The gerbil movie.
[35:39.860 --> 35:40.220]  Whoa.
[35:40.780 --> 35:41.160]  Whoa.
[35:42.040 --> 35:42.820]  This is good.
[35:43.200 --> 35:43.620]  Guinea pig?
[35:43.680 --> 35:44.700]  Is it? We like that.
[35:46.100 --> 35:47.380]  It's raining in heck.
[35:51.510 --> 35:51.910]  Huh.
[35:57.900 --> 36:00.520]  Ah, and now you fill the water.
[36:05.300 --> 36:06.460]  Look at this.
[36:07.900 --> 36:08.700]  Look at that.
[36:09.560 --> 36:10.380]  A little water action.
[36:10.880 --> 36:11.960]  A little water action.
[36:14.240 --> 36:16.560]  Oh, I expected that thing to rise up when you...
[36:16.560 --> 36:16.700]  Whoa!
[36:17.860 --> 36:18.760]  Oh, you're losing water.
[36:20.220 --> 36:21.300]  Oh, it goes down.
[36:21.600 --> 36:22.560]  Well, am I going to just jump?
[36:23.260 --> 36:23.800]  Do you need to...
[36:23.800 --> 36:24.420]  Seems crazy.
[36:24.580 --> 36:25.540]  Do you need to pull that...
[36:25.540 --> 36:26.540]  There you go.
[36:27.260 --> 36:28.380]  You got to let it fill up.
[36:29.500 --> 36:31.380]  Yeah, but do I need a second thing?
[36:34.500 --> 36:36.900]  Can you raise that thing on the left of the hole?
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.220]  You see how it's like a straight line?
[36:42.740 --> 36:43.100]  Ah!
[36:44.240 --> 36:44.600]  That.
[36:45.560 --> 36:46.260]  Oh, can you...
[36:47.780 --> 36:49.340]  I'll just move it.
[36:49.340 --> 36:50.120]  I'll wait for it to sink.
[36:50.240 --> 36:50.660]  I'll move it.
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.820]  And then you physically move it.
[36:52.140 --> 36:52.780]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:52.780 --> 36:53.240]  Oh, yeah.
[36:53.500 --> 36:53.780]  Okay.
[36:54.180 --> 36:54.680]  There you go.
[36:55.020 --> 36:57.420]  I thought if I went down there without water, I would die.
[36:57.520 --> 36:58.660]  Right. I thought the same.
[37:01.680 --> 37:02.480]  All right.
[37:07.670 --> 37:08.470]  Happy Friday.
[37:09.890 --> 37:10.690]  Happy Friday.
[37:11.890 --> 37:13.070]  We'll go to 5.04.
[37:13.910 --> 37:14.310]  What?
[37:15.170 --> 37:15.970]  Holy shit.
[37:17.570 --> 37:19.130]  Because we started late.
[37:19.630 --> 37:20.790]  We did. We started on time.
[37:21.090 --> 37:22.550]  Somebody couldn't figure out their audio.
[37:41.270 --> 37:43.310]  I wish there were more games like this.
[37:45.970 --> 37:46.750]  There are a few.
[37:47.890 --> 37:49.430]  You try that one I sent you.
[37:49.570 --> 37:50.690]  It's from the same people.
[37:51.850 --> 37:55.190]  Yeah, it's just was a pretty slow start.
[37:55.850 --> 37:56.470]  Yeah, it is.
[37:56.990 --> 37:57.910]  And to give it a second...
[37:58.910 --> 38:00.110]  There's some cool...
[38:00.110 --> 38:02.630]  I mean, it's definitely not as good as Limbo or Inside.
[38:03.330 --> 38:05.070]  There's some cool set pieces in it.
[38:05.350 --> 38:05.770]  Didn't work.
[38:09.230 --> 38:09.910]  All right.
[38:10.330 --> 38:12.470]  I don't know why I thought I could go under that.
[38:13.410 --> 38:14.350]  Well, you're learning.
[38:14.990 --> 38:15.830]  You'll know for next time.
[38:16.390 --> 38:17.350]  Yeah, this is new ground.
[38:17.710 --> 38:19.130]  Yep. It's important.
[38:20.810 --> 38:21.290]  Vital.
[38:26.420 --> 38:26.720]  Oh.
[38:28.000 --> 38:28.680]  Oh, okay.
[38:28.960 --> 38:29.500]  A little push.
[38:30.520 --> 38:31.260]  Give me a little push.
[38:35.550 --> 38:37.430]  When was the last time you pushed something?
[38:39.410 --> 38:40.290]  Pushed a button.
[38:41.070 --> 38:41.890]  That's true.
[38:42.150 --> 38:44.610]  But I mean, like, physically, like, slid something.
[38:46.850 --> 38:48.350]  I pushed a suitcase.
[38:49.890 --> 38:52.470]  Is this going to drown me if I block this water?
[38:55.050 --> 38:55.570]  No.
[38:55.870 --> 38:56.090]  Maybe.
[38:57.570 --> 38:57.890]  Yeah.
[38:58.150 --> 38:58.410]  Okay.
[38:58.550 --> 38:59.570]  Nick is positive on it.
[39:00.590 --> 39:01.610]  What am I doing?
[39:03.670 --> 39:04.690]  Looks like...
[39:04.690 --> 39:04.950]  I'm trying to...
[39:05.710 --> 39:06.810]  You need to get...
[39:10.150 --> 39:12.010]  I want to get the box up there, maybe.
[39:12.390 --> 39:12.830]  Yeah.
[39:15.310 --> 39:18.630]  And when you close it, the water will rise and bring the box with it.
[39:22.470 --> 39:23.890]  So maybe move it.
[39:24.350 --> 39:25.770]  Yeah, over there to the left.
[39:27.010 --> 39:27.710]  Over here?
[39:27.810 --> 39:30.250]  No, like, you see how you open that slot up top?
[39:30.850 --> 39:32.550]  Slide the box to the middle of it.
[39:40.860 --> 39:41.760]  Like, right there.
[39:43.720 --> 39:45.120]  And it floats up there.
[39:46.460 --> 39:47.320]  And I'll just have to...
[39:49.160 --> 39:50.080]  How fast can you go?
[39:50.780 --> 39:51.020]  Go!
[39:51.100 --> 39:52.400]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[39:52.400 --> 39:53.120]  You have to go faster.
[39:53.860 --> 39:55.340]  And then get ready to push that.
[39:55.600 --> 39:57.100]  So you have to push that a little bit over.
[39:58.340 --> 39:58.620]  Ready?
[39:59.580 --> 39:59.860]  Ready?
[40:00.200 --> 40:00.480]  Easy.
[40:01.160 --> 40:01.440]  Easy.
[40:02.140 --> 40:02.420]  Easy.
[40:02.720 --> 40:03.340]  It's pretty quick.
[40:03.380 --> 40:03.800]  There you go.
[40:03.860 --> 40:04.360]  Bury it.
[40:04.720 --> 40:04.900]  Go.
[40:05.240 --> 40:06.040]  No, climb it, climb it!
[40:06.140 --> 40:06.280]  Now go!
[40:06.460 --> 40:06.680]  Oh, god!
[40:09.840 --> 40:10.840]  Just enough for you to walk, I think.
[40:10.840 --> 40:11.580]  I don't think you need to seal it.
[40:11.660 --> 40:12.840]  I think you need to hop on it.
[40:13.080 --> 40:14.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:18.680 --> 40:21.140]  I thought you could swim just a little bit more than that.
[40:25.700 --> 40:27.920]  I wonder if I should eat those leftovers for dinner.
[40:28.940 --> 40:29.680]  Oh, what you got?
[40:29.900 --> 40:30.460]  What's in the fridge?
[40:30.580 --> 40:31.360]  Oh, I can't tell you.
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.080]  That's a surprise.
[40:34.340 --> 40:37.120]  And just to be clear, it's not a surprise for any of you.
[40:37.200 --> 40:39.760]  It's just that we ate it for 100% eat.
[40:39.880 --> 40:41.560]  Right, but it might be a surprise for some people.
[40:41.920 --> 40:43.640]  Right, but not for Gavin, necessarily.
[40:44.060 --> 40:44.480]  Okay, Gavin.
[40:45.760 --> 40:46.860]  I'll offline with you.
[40:47.000 --> 40:47.640]  Oh, that's another thing.
[40:47.740 --> 40:49.520]  All right, good deal.
[40:49.560 --> 40:50.520]  Oh, this is live.
[40:50.660 --> 40:52.600]  We have Gracie on for next week's episode.
[40:52.860 --> 40:53.380]  And it is...
[40:53.380 --> 40:53.500]  That's on.
[40:53.740 --> 40:53.980]  Shit!
[40:54.180 --> 40:55.200]  What are you doing?
[40:59.800 --> 41:00.880]  He's hitting buttons?
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.960]  Did he drown in real life, do you think?
[41:04.280 --> 41:04.600]  This kid.
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.820]  I got wobbled and then...
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.180]  You didn't get wobbled.
[41:10.080 --> 41:14.940]  The idea of dying and then like being in some form of afterlife and explaining what happened.
[41:15.020 --> 41:15.960]  I got wobbled.
[41:16.240 --> 41:16.840]  I got wobbled.
[41:17.520 --> 41:19.060]  Honestly, there was a bunch of water.
[41:19.180 --> 41:19.820]  I got wobbled.
[41:20.280 --> 41:22.300]  I think that'd be a real rough way to go, though.
[41:22.420 --> 41:24.820]  Is dying after almost dying.
[41:25.560 --> 41:26.680]  Dying from the shock of...
[41:27.800 --> 41:29.920]  Are you joking?
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.420]  Guys, I sealed the gate and didn't move.
[41:35.160 --> 41:36.280]  I drowned again.
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.700]  Oh, that was...
[41:37.700 --> 41:38.540]  You're falling apart.
[41:39.380 --> 41:39.800]  I know.
[41:41.980 --> 41:42.420]  So...
[41:44.680 --> 41:47.380]  Amwo914 said 14 in brackets 15.
[41:50.960 --> 41:52.920]  You could just do the total at this point.
[41:54.400 --> 41:55.280]  What are you doing?
[41:56.040 --> 41:57.140]  What are you doing?
[41:57.340 --> 41:57.860]  What's happening?
[41:57.940 --> 41:58.560]  Are you all right?
[41:58.860 --> 41:59.280]  Are you okay?
[41:59.700 --> 42:00.000]  Okay.
[42:00.200 --> 42:01.420]  This happened last time as well.
[42:01.500 --> 42:02.160]  I just started...
[42:02.160 --> 42:02.800]  I got loopy.
[42:02.980 --> 42:04.120]  It all starts going wrong.
[42:05.280 --> 42:06.240]  Start hitting buttons.
[42:15.050 --> 42:16.350]  Oh, what was that about?
[42:18.010 --> 42:19.070]  You getting wobbly?
[42:19.890 --> 42:19.970]  Yeah.
[42:20.310 --> 42:22.570]  Oh, no, he's getting wobbly.
[42:22.830 --> 42:26.310]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, wobble, uh-oh.
[42:26.810 --> 42:29.130]  Wait, wait, wait.
[42:29.310 --> 42:29.910]  There you go.
[42:33.130 --> 42:34.890]  You better pull that out.
[42:36.070 --> 42:36.770]  There you go.
[42:37.570 --> 42:38.130]  Jump on.
[42:38.470 --> 42:39.050]  Oh, there you go.
[42:39.250 --> 42:39.790]  Nice job.
[42:40.830 --> 42:43.230]  Oh, don't get caught.
[42:43.910 --> 42:44.550]  Don't get...
[42:44.550 --> 42:45.230]  Don't tease that lip.
[42:45.790 --> 42:46.470]  I should have given it more...
[42:47.430 --> 42:48.070]  Oh, boy.
[42:48.190 --> 42:48.610]  Oh, boy.
[42:48.730 --> 42:49.070]  That's close.
[42:49.450 --> 42:49.750]  It'll drift over.
[42:49.830 --> 42:50.470]  It'll drift over.
[42:50.770 --> 42:51.550]  Oh, no, it doesn't.
[42:52.510 --> 42:52.990]  Oh, damn.
[42:53.050 --> 42:53.490]  I didn't even...
[42:53.490 --> 42:53.630]  Okay.
[42:54.750 --> 42:55.490]  Is the water still...
[42:56.870 --> 42:57.510]  What a jump.
[42:58.950 --> 42:59.590]  Oh, wow.
[43:00.570 --> 43:00.890]  Wow.
[43:01.430 --> 43:02.010]  I'm panicking.
[43:02.130 --> 43:03.110]  I don't know where I am or what I'm doing.
[43:03.470 --> 43:03.670]  All right.
[43:03.730 --> 43:03.990]  Excellent.
[43:05.050 --> 43:05.370]  Well...
[43:05.370 --> 43:07.750]  It's like he has the brain worm that makes him keep moving forward,
[43:07.890 --> 43:08.990]  but nothing's making him do it.
[43:14.430 --> 43:15.390]  Oh, close it.
[43:15.630 --> 43:16.470]  Oh, no.
[43:17.290 --> 43:18.270]  Gavin, open it.
[43:20.770 --> 43:21.290]  Oh, well.
[43:21.530 --> 43:22.410]  Then it needs to...
[43:22.410 --> 43:22.750]  It needs to...
[43:22.750 --> 43:23.250]  You got to move it.
[43:23.550 --> 43:25.190]  Push the plug and then now it won't.
[43:25.290 --> 43:26.050]  And now I'm going to die.
[43:26.310 --> 43:26.450]  Yeah.
[43:27.150 --> 43:27.390]  Yep.
[43:27.470 --> 43:27.630]  Yeah.
[43:27.890 --> 43:28.290]  Yep.
[43:28.730 --> 43:29.030]  Yeah.
[43:29.570 --> 43:29.790]  Yeah.
[43:30.150 --> 43:30.510]  Yep.
[43:30.950 --> 43:31.150]  Yeah.
[43:32.690 --> 43:34.970]  Although, realistically, I think the plug should float.
[43:36.090 --> 43:36.750]  It is.
[43:37.510 --> 43:38.070]  Oh, that plug.
[43:40.410 --> 43:42.070]  I should send them an email about it.
[43:43.590 --> 43:45.130]  Dear makers of limbo.
[43:48.530 --> 43:50.170]  Why would a plug float?
[43:51.490 --> 43:52.290]  How would it see it?
[43:53.710 --> 43:54.570]  Oh, my God.
[43:54.670 --> 43:54.910]  Wow.
[43:54.990 --> 43:55.490]  That was cool.
[43:56.390 --> 43:56.790]  Crazy.
[43:58.330 --> 43:59.550]  So it looks like it can...
[43:59.550 --> 44:01.190]  It leaps initially here, right?
[44:01.630 --> 44:02.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:02.070 --> 44:02.870]  Yeah, do a little jumpy.
[44:02.890 --> 44:03.410]  But I'll be ready.
[44:03.810 --> 44:04.210]  I'll be ready.
[44:04.470 --> 44:05.050]  It's going to snap.
[44:05.290 --> 44:06.010]  It's going to snap.
[44:06.730 --> 44:07.650]  Snap and catch.
[44:08.050 --> 44:08.650]  Snap and catch.
[44:08.650 --> 44:09.350]  Here we go, here we go.
[44:10.050 --> 44:10.770]  Catch it, catch it, catch it.
[44:10.890 --> 44:11.950]  Okay, roll that shit.
[44:12.990 --> 44:13.490]  Roll it.
[44:13.710 --> 44:13.970]  See ya.
[44:14.150 --> 44:14.690]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[44:15.050 --> 44:15.670]  Oh, wow.
[44:16.150 --> 44:16.470]  Nice.
[44:17.130 --> 44:18.210]  Wow, way to go.
[44:18.850 --> 44:20.150]  Climb, you little bastard, climb.
[44:21.050 --> 44:22.110]  He is a little bastard.
[44:26.260 --> 44:28.700]  I'm sure that was his name under the development.
[44:29.080 --> 44:29.580]  Little bastard.
[44:29.940 --> 44:30.080]  Lil.
[44:30.640 --> 44:31.280]  Lil bastard.
[44:35.870 --> 44:36.290]  Uh-oh.
[44:37.210 --> 44:37.670]  Uh-oh.
[44:37.810 --> 44:38.410]  Oh, you're drifting.
[44:38.410 --> 44:39.330]  Come this way a little bit, plug.
[44:40.810 --> 44:41.430]  Oh, you're good.
[44:41.470 --> 44:41.670]  You're good.
[44:41.710 --> 44:42.170]  Just give it time.
[44:42.910 --> 44:44.570]  All right, it's still rising.
[44:44.750 --> 44:44.930]  All right.
[44:45.430 --> 44:45.750]  You're all right.
[44:45.830 --> 44:46.110]  It's done.
[44:46.270 --> 44:46.670]  It's done rising.
[44:46.830 --> 44:46.990]  Did it stop?
[44:47.550 --> 44:47.770]  Yep.
[44:48.050 --> 44:48.370]  Yes.
[44:48.610 --> 44:51.430]  And that kid, if he could swim, he'd be in really good shape.
[44:52.930 --> 44:55.830]  I wonder if I could get from the beginning to this part without dying.
[44:56.170 --> 44:56.710]  I bet you could.
[44:59.770 --> 45:02.490]  See, this is why you have to get deep in this, because you're going to figure it out.
[45:03.210 --> 45:04.590]  Should I go for another deathless then?
[45:05.350 --> 45:05.630]  Sure.
[45:05.850 --> 45:08.270]  No, no, I think you got to go further.
[45:08.390 --> 45:09.190]  Just keep going, yeah.
[45:09.670 --> 45:10.790]  I think you got to go further.
[45:12.730 --> 45:13.790]  Oh, okay.
[45:15.030 --> 45:16.170]  Oh.
[45:18.430 --> 45:20.710]  All right.
[45:28.030 --> 45:40.930]  Am I an idiot?
[45:44.980 --> 45:45.940]  Now run.
[45:49.020 --> 45:55.070]  So what's the...
[45:56.180 --> 45:57.060]  Well, I'm trying to get up there.
[45:57.720 --> 45:57.980]  Yeah.
[46:05.320 --> 46:05.920]  Almost.
[46:08.400 --> 46:09.360]  Almost there.
[46:12.820 --> 46:14.500]  Just a little bit more.
[46:18.980 --> 46:19.860]  Slightly more.
[46:19.880 --> 46:20.860]  There you go.
[46:34.770 --> 46:37.290]  You think there's anything up there above it?
[46:42.290 --> 46:42.710]  Okay.
[46:46.580 --> 46:48.780]  You can tell he's really thinking when he walks slow.
[46:48.980 --> 46:49.140]  Yep.
[46:49.620 --> 46:49.880]  Yep.
[46:50.460 --> 46:52.420]  Just the gears are turning.
[46:53.760 --> 46:55.920]  That's a little, uh, yeah, you know.
[46:56.360 --> 46:58.800]  Whoa, whoa, he's twerking.
[47:00.020 --> 47:01.000]  He's dancing.
[47:04.460 --> 47:06.680]  No, he looks sad.
[47:07.540 --> 47:08.060]  Oh, I'm stuck.
[47:11.460 --> 47:13.620]  What a dumb death.
[47:14.600 --> 47:15.420]  So this one?
[47:16.180 --> 47:18.140]  So I just go back to that one?
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.840]  Yeah, this one and that one.
[47:20.660 --> 47:21.940]  And then this one.
[47:23.500 --> 47:24.640]  And then that one.
[47:28.590 --> 47:29.290]  Good jumps.
[47:34.960 --> 47:36.720]  That's unnecessarily risky.
[47:36.980 --> 47:37.060]  Whoops.
[47:43.890 --> 47:45.910]  Ah, sneaky, sneaky.
[47:46.710 --> 47:47.430]  Crafty.
[47:49.450 --> 47:50.430]  And drown.
[47:50.690 --> 47:50.790]  No.
[47:51.450 --> 47:52.230]  Oh, he made it.
[47:53.470 --> 47:54.350]  Well, okay.
[47:55.550 --> 48:00.710]  I think now it will drop hard enough for it to hit and launch it.
[48:05.780 --> 48:06.900]  Or not.
[48:12.380 --> 48:13.280]  Nailed it.
[48:14.540 --> 48:15.100]  Perfect.
[48:16.740 --> 48:17.780]  No notes.
[48:23.220 --> 48:25.580]  So wait, did it start down or was it down?
[48:25.700 --> 48:25.960]  Whoa.
[48:29.740 --> 48:33.160]  So you've reset it to the original thing now.
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.420]  So what are you trying to do?
[48:39.440 --> 48:40.860]  What do you think you're trying to do?
[48:44.740 --> 48:45.280]  Okay.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.180]  Is that how it started?
[48:48.840 --> 48:49.160]  Yes.
[48:49.700 --> 48:50.160]  Okay.
[48:51.540 --> 48:52.840]  Wait, so what?
[48:52.860 --> 48:53.860]  You're just undoing everything?
[48:53.980 --> 48:54.440]  What are you doing?
[48:56.260 --> 48:58.880]  But it started with more water on the right, right?
[48:59.540 --> 49:01.080]  You need more water on the right.
[49:01.400 --> 49:01.660]  Right.
[49:01.820 --> 49:03.200]  But that's how it started, isn't it?
[49:04.500 --> 49:05.020]  Yeah.
[49:06.360 --> 49:07.200]  All right, try it now.
[49:11.250 --> 49:12.270]  So it's even.
[49:15.250 --> 49:16.290]  All right.
[49:22.700 --> 49:23.220]  Okay.
[49:27.940 --> 49:28.980]  I just...
[49:28.980 --> 49:30.720]  Did I never do that?
[49:31.320 --> 49:33.900]  I thought I already did that.
[49:36.500 --> 49:40.200]  I don't know, that's why I was watching you do it and going like, I'm not sure.
[49:40.340 --> 49:41.540]  Like, you're there.
[49:41.640 --> 49:43.180]  I don't know what the issue is.
[49:43.280 --> 49:45.180]  So did you just never attempt the jump over?
[49:45.440 --> 49:47.240]  Is that what we're coming to the conclusion of here?
[49:48.020 --> 49:50.980]  Is there the possibility that we're not streaming?
[49:51.560 --> 49:52.180]  What do you mean?
[49:53.100 --> 49:54.920]  Like, could it be that no one saw that?
[49:55.240 --> 49:56.300]  Oh, no, no, no.
[49:56.480 --> 49:59.500]  No, and we're recording it, so everyone saw it.
[50:00.100 --> 50:00.880]  So yeah.
[50:02.480 --> 50:02.820]  Yeah.
[50:03.980 --> 50:04.900]  This is a dream.
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.760]  Like, Crucified Donkey and everyone, they all saw it, dude.
[50:13.180 --> 50:15.720]  I don't know, someone said they closed their eyes, so, you know, I'm a fan of that person.
[50:15.720 --> 50:18.460]  Yeah, but Crucified Donkey's the first try, so...
[50:18.460 --> 50:21.340]  And GDuff even gifted five subs, so I mean, really, it's...
[50:21.340 --> 50:21.980]  Oh, man.
[50:22.280 --> 50:24.940]  Ah, bollocks, I killed myself because I didn't do something fast.
[50:25.000 --> 50:25.160]  Yep.
[50:32.100 --> 50:35.740]  All right, so I just need to get this real quick, right?
[50:36.400 --> 50:38.360]  And then I need to walk into this.
[50:39.440 --> 50:39.880]  Okay.
[50:48.040 --> 50:48.460]  No.
[50:53.120 --> 50:53.560]  Well...
[50:53.560 --> 50:54.020]  Wait, what?
[50:54.220 --> 50:54.540]  No.
[50:56.040 --> 50:57.520]  Guess the light'll get it off.
[50:58.040 --> 50:58.340]  This is good.
[50:58.360 --> 50:59.180]  No, it'll just make it turn around.
[50:59.420 --> 51:00.040]  Oh, it turned.
[51:00.040 --> 51:00.420]  This is good.
[51:03.560 --> 51:04.720]  Can I climb?
[51:04.900 --> 51:05.120]  Okay.
[51:08.380 --> 51:08.820]  Oh.
[51:09.220 --> 51:10.820]  Can I...
[51:11.360 --> 51:12.220]  You can go down?
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.080]  I was just trying to get the light on my head.
[51:15.080 --> 51:15.400]  Oh, I see.
[51:16.300 --> 51:16.760]  My head.
[51:18.400 --> 51:19.080]  Little light.
[51:21.540 --> 51:22.240]  Keep jumping.
[51:22.580 --> 51:22.980]  Jumping.
[51:23.980 --> 51:24.780]  You just...
[51:24.780 --> 51:25.340]  Oh, wow!
[51:26.700 --> 51:28.340]  The game was very polite to you.
[51:28.480 --> 51:28.620]  Oh, no!
[51:29.140 --> 51:29.640]  Oh, no!
[51:30.180 --> 51:31.180]  No, you're okay. You're all right.
[51:31.180 --> 51:32.940]  You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're all right.
[51:33.020 --> 51:33.260]  The speed!
[51:34.620 --> 51:35.440]  Do I... do I climb?
[51:35.640 --> 51:35.920]  Yeah.
[51:36.160 --> 51:37.680]  Yeah, looks like it.
[51:42.310 --> 51:42.970]  Bring me...
[51:44.270 --> 51:45.690]  I'm just gonna go back to...
[51:46.750 --> 51:48.910]  Yeah, I wonder if you have to go all the way back.
[51:49.390 --> 51:49.750]  Oops.
[51:50.870 --> 51:52.730]  You gotta get turned around and then...
[51:52.730 --> 51:53.390]  The water has risen.
[51:54.290 --> 51:54.810]  Yeah, there you go.
[51:54.890 --> 51:56.030]  Oh, I just should have done it much faster?
[51:56.350 --> 51:56.690]  Yeah.
[51:57.250 --> 51:59.030]  I mean, that shouldn't have been a big surprise.
[51:59.350 --> 51:59.710]  Okay.
[52:00.690 --> 52:01.050]  Story...
[52:01.050 --> 52:01.610]  Water's still rising.
[52:01.990 --> 52:03.450]  Story the whole fucking game.
[52:03.610 --> 52:04.570]  I can still make it!
[52:04.930 --> 52:06.070]  I can still make it!
[52:06.070 --> 52:06.530]  You're almost there!
[52:06.650 --> 52:06.890]  No!
[52:07.950 --> 52:09.510]  Just stood... just stood there.
[52:09.590 --> 52:11.730]  Not sure why, but you just stood there and that was pretty exciting.
[52:12.790 --> 52:13.450]  What would you have done?
[52:13.810 --> 52:14.930]  Gone! Kept going!
[52:15.890 --> 52:17.010]  Clearly you need to keep going!
[52:17.410 --> 52:19.110]  You just hung out on the fucking ladder!
[52:20.910 --> 52:21.490]  Uh... yeah.
[52:22.430 --> 52:25.490]  You could say that.
[52:25.570 --> 52:26.650]  There you go, look at you.
[52:27.050 --> 52:31.530]  Like, clearly it wants you to go all the way, turn around, come back, and like, move something.
[52:32.230 --> 52:34.410]  Well, I did this run, I thought, what would Eric do?
[52:34.650 --> 52:37.710]  Yeah, and it was climb the ladder as high as possible?
[52:38.670 --> 52:40.170]  I think you need to push that box.
[52:41.330 --> 52:42.810]  I need... I need the box still?
[52:42.970 --> 52:43.690]  I think so.
[52:43.750 --> 52:45.870]  I think you need to push the box all the way to the right because it floats.
[52:45.890 --> 52:47.650]  Maybe not, I can't tell.
[52:48.610 --> 52:50.010]  Is there like a pipe you jump on?
[52:51.090 --> 52:53.230]  Yeah, let's get the box.
[52:54.370 --> 52:55.750]  Right, you need the box.
[52:56.930 --> 52:57.770]  The box.
[53:00.630 --> 53:01.850]  This is the one.
[53:02.910 --> 53:04.630]  Now I'm thinking, what would Nick do?
[53:05.770 --> 53:06.330]  I'd be panicking.
[53:06.330 --> 53:06.950]  Oh, he'd get the box.
[53:08.010 --> 53:09.750]  Nick would have already died at this part.
[53:09.850 --> 53:10.650]  He would have started hitting buttons.
[53:11.050 --> 53:12.110]  He would have just started hitting buttons.
[53:12.750 --> 53:14.270]  Nick is a known box getter.
[53:14.410 --> 53:14.590]  Yeah.
[53:14.590 --> 53:16.090]  He loves box.
[53:16.210 --> 53:17.130]  I love box.
[53:23.520 --> 53:24.780]  Get that box.
[53:25.100 --> 53:25.780]  Oh shit.
[53:26.120 --> 53:27.340]  He's always saying it.
[53:27.600 --> 53:29.360]  Does it go all the way or does it stop?
[53:29.480 --> 53:30.460]  Maybe it stops.
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.200]  Is there a pipe over here?
[53:33.440 --> 53:33.820]  Shit!
[53:34.140 --> 53:34.820]  Keep going, keep going.
[53:34.940 --> 53:37.560]  Maybe it'll just end up in the useful place.
[53:38.140 --> 53:39.260]  But where's the pipe?
[53:40.980 --> 53:42.260]  You think you need to jump across?
[53:42.660 --> 53:43.640]  No, you need to jump across.
[53:46.300 --> 53:47.340]  Oh, there's something.
[53:47.500 --> 53:48.640]  Something's raising over there.
[53:49.200 --> 53:49.660]  Yeah, it's the pipe.
[53:49.800 --> 53:50.540]  That didn't have any...
[53:50.540 --> 53:50.740]  What?
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.960]  What were you doing?
[53:53.240 --> 53:54.860]  You could have done it.
[53:54.980 --> 53:55.740]  You could have just waited.
[53:55.840 --> 53:56.360]  You had it.
[53:56.360 --> 53:57.300]  You just needed to wait a moment.
[53:57.440 --> 53:58.020]  You had it.
[53:58.180 --> 53:59.760]  Yeah, I just forgot that I had the worm on my head.
[54:00.600 --> 54:01.000]  What?
[54:01.880 --> 54:05.740]  Well, I'm not controlling the walking, so I forgot that.
[54:05.880 --> 54:06.740]  I briefly forgot that.
[54:07.940 --> 54:09.980]  I forgot the game mechanic of the game.
[54:15.690 --> 54:17.030]  So I don't need this box.
[54:17.190 --> 54:17.410]  No.
[54:18.030 --> 54:18.630]  Okay.
[54:19.930 --> 54:21.330]  So I was just impatient.
[54:21.710 --> 54:23.110]  That was very Eric of me then.
[54:24.070 --> 54:25.610]  I don't think that was impatient.
[54:25.830 --> 54:27.930]  You forgot how the fucking game worked.
[54:28.210 --> 54:30.510]  No, I mean the time before when I didn't wait for this.
[54:30.890 --> 54:31.230]  Right.
[54:33.390 --> 54:34.690]  Nick loves boxes.
[54:36.530 --> 54:37.670]  Big mover guy.
[54:38.130 --> 54:39.130]  Big mover guy.
[54:42.020 --> 54:43.360]  Love packing boxes.
[54:45.960 --> 54:47.980]  I enjoy a virtual pack.
[54:49.880 --> 54:54.400]  We were just talking today when we were all dead in repo and you guys...
[54:54.400 --> 54:54.600]  Oops.
[54:55.140 --> 54:56.460]  Yeah, I've still got...
[54:56.460 --> 54:57.400]  Guys, I've still got the worm.
[54:57.820 --> 54:58.760]  I've still got the worm.
[54:58.940 --> 55:01.100]  Hey guys, he's still got the worm in case you're wondering.
[55:09.660 --> 55:11.180]  Still got the old worm there.
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.300]  It's an important worm to remember.
[55:15.120 --> 55:16.160]  It controls my legs.
[55:19.620 --> 55:22.500]  Hey, pay no mind to that attempt.
[55:23.040 --> 55:25.740]  Hopefully people were blinking, had their eyes closed again.
[55:26.320 --> 55:27.740]  No, crucified donkey saw it.
[55:27.840 --> 55:28.200]  I can tell.
[55:28.560 --> 55:29.060]  Oh, okay.
[55:31.240 --> 55:33.380]  You know, you sit long enough on a ladder and you just think,
[55:33.480 --> 55:34.640]  maybe I don't have the worm anymore.
[55:34.760 --> 55:35.340]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:35.340 --> 55:36.280]  That's usually what happens.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.580]  Happens to me all the time.
[55:38.880 --> 55:40.680]  Yeah, I'm constantly on the ladder going,
[55:40.740 --> 55:42.200]  I certainly don't have the worm anymore.
[55:43.540 --> 55:45.320]  Salad boy said he had his monitor off for that one.
[55:45.520 --> 55:46.140]  Oh, that's funny.
[55:46.140 --> 55:47.620]  Solid, solid.
[55:48.220 --> 55:49.500]  How many players do you think that worm is?
[55:55.360 --> 55:56.240]  Look at you go.
[55:56.360 --> 55:56.880]  Look at this.
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.000]  Look at this.
[55:58.280 --> 55:58.960]  Remember the worm.
[55:59.360 --> 55:59.780]  Don't forget.
[56:00.220 --> 56:00.440]  Yeah.
[56:00.560 --> 56:01.100]  Here we go.
[56:01.340 --> 56:02.340]  I'm remembering the worm.
[56:02.500 --> 56:03.460]  See this right now?
[56:03.580 --> 56:03.940]  You see this?
[56:04.020 --> 56:06.740]  This is me remembering the worm.
[56:08.400 --> 56:09.140]  Way to go.
[56:09.440 --> 56:09.880]  Excellent.
[56:10.300 --> 56:10.680]  Eat my worm.
[56:11.440 --> 56:12.320]  My worm.
[56:13.200 --> 56:14.980]  Your worm memory paid off, buddy.
[56:16.360 --> 56:17.260]  Is the water still rising?
[56:18.260 --> 56:19.360]  Um, it's raining.
[56:19.780 --> 56:20.600]  No.
[56:23.600 --> 56:31.760]  I feel like I maybe should have planted something for use here.
[56:43.520 --> 56:45.200]  Good jump.
[56:45.860 --> 56:46.440]  Way to go.
[56:51.080 --> 56:52.060]  Nothing over there?
[56:52.780 --> 56:53.860]  5-0-1.
[56:54.220 --> 56:56.080]  We made it all the way.
[56:56.300 --> 56:57.160]  Holy shit.
[56:57.260 --> 56:58.100]  Best time of the week.
[57:00.620 --> 57:05.080]  How many deaths will it take me to get to this spot next time?
[57:05.300 --> 57:06.120]  I think you can do it.
[57:06.140 --> 57:06.800]  I think you'll be fine.
[57:07.940 --> 57:09.020]  Well, there you have it.
[57:09.240 --> 57:12.980]  No, it doesn't seem to be.
[57:13.680 --> 57:13.940]  Okay.
[57:14.420 --> 57:15.240]  Just try a jump.
[57:15.300 --> 57:15.880]  See what you can do.
[57:16.860 --> 57:17.900]  Try jumping this?
[57:19.420 --> 57:19.500]  Oh.
[57:22.600 --> 57:23.740]  Like, okay, look.
[57:23.880 --> 57:25.220]  That looked too big to jump, right?
[57:25.240 --> 57:25.980]  It looked pretty big, but...
[57:25.980 --> 57:26.460]  That's massive.
[57:26.680 --> 57:29.600]  You just let yourself fall into a pit instead the last time.
[57:30.060 --> 57:30.460]  Yeah.
[57:31.940 --> 57:32.420]  Yeah.
[57:32.980 --> 57:34.560]  Without trying to jump or anything.
[57:35.200 --> 57:35.500]  Yep.
[57:41.030 --> 57:42.030]  But you know what?
[57:42.210 --> 57:42.950]  5-0-1.
[57:43.370 --> 57:44.110]  Pretty good stuff.
[57:44.770 --> 57:45.690]  Great stuff.
[57:46.090 --> 57:46.330]  Yeah.
[57:46.470 --> 57:46.650]  Great.
[57:46.770 --> 57:47.670]  Gavin learned a lot.
[57:48.310 --> 57:48.850]  I agree.
[57:49.010 --> 57:50.370]  I learned a lot, and it's all gonna stick.
[57:50.710 --> 57:50.910]  Yeah.
[57:51.790 --> 57:52.670]  Hey, honestly...
[57:52.670 --> 57:53.010]  Okay.
[57:54.350 --> 57:55.050]  You just...
[57:55.050 --> 57:56.090]  You don't do...
[57:56.530 --> 58:00.250]  You're just the person that does yourself, like, the least amount of favors that I know.
[58:00.370 --> 58:01.510]  That was really special.
[58:05.230 --> 58:06.630]  I'm just a little boy.
[58:10.390 --> 58:10.830]  Wow.
[58:11.550 --> 58:12.950]  I'm just a little boy.
[58:13.130 --> 58:14.610]  Oh, God, remember this?
[58:15.070 --> 58:15.470]  I do.
[58:16.450 --> 58:16.890]  No.
[58:17.070 --> 58:17.910]  You get zapped.
[58:18.590 --> 58:18.890]  Oh.
[58:19.870 --> 58:21.490]  Is the O there, or is that just fake?
[58:22.050 --> 58:23.070]  I think the O's there.
[58:23.250 --> 58:27.190]  And I have to jump when it's still on, so that when I land, it's off.
[58:27.750 --> 58:29.190]  And then I can make it to the O.
[58:36.150 --> 58:39.770]  Well, chat, what do you think of that?
[58:40.110 --> 58:44.410]  How are you feeling about Gavin's chances of being able to get this achievement?
[58:44.630 --> 58:45.710]  Oh, you got that this time.
[58:46.050 --> 58:46.570]  There you go.
[58:46.910 --> 58:47.550]  Look at him go.
[58:47.830 --> 58:48.510]  Get me there.
[58:48.850 --> 58:49.470]  Oh, the T?
[58:50.190 --> 58:50.910]  Uh-oh.
[58:51.170 --> 58:52.350]  Is the T done with now?
[58:52.350 --> 58:53.010]  Sweet.
[58:54.530 --> 58:54.930]  Go!
[58:56.570 --> 58:56.970]  Well...
[58:58.470 --> 59:00.050]  It's clearly lit.
[59:00.910 --> 59:02.670]  No, but he yelled go, so I think...
[59:02.670 --> 59:03.270]  He did.
[59:04.710 --> 59:06.950]  So honestly, like, what choice do you have, Nick?
[59:07.250 --> 59:09.430]  Hey, look, a gap. I bet I can jump it.
[59:09.590 --> 59:09.830]  Okay.
[59:11.730 --> 59:12.130]  Almost.
[59:14.450 --> 59:16.750]  All right, let me get to the end of the hotel.
[59:17.090 --> 59:17.150]  Okay.
[59:17.250 --> 59:19.050]  And then it's a great stopping point.
[59:19.470 --> 59:20.610]  Sounds really good.
[59:21.170 --> 59:21.950]  So that's on.
[59:21.950 --> 59:23.490]  You don't want to do that when it's on.
[59:24.350 --> 59:24.490]  Yeah.
[59:28.210 --> 59:31.190]  And a one, and a two, and a...
[59:32.190 --> 59:33.370]  There you go.
[59:35.670 --> 59:36.490]  Yo, what's up, kid?
[59:38.010 --> 59:38.930]  You grab the rope.
[59:39.130 --> 59:39.930]  There you go.
[59:40.390 --> 59:40.830]  There you go.
[59:40.990 --> 59:42.650]  Nick's kid knows that it's after 5.01.
[59:43.030 --> 59:45.190]  He's like, dad, you're fucking done with this bullshit.
[59:45.390 --> 59:45.730]  Come on.
[59:47.170 --> 59:48.590]  Stop watching Gavin die.
[59:48.670 --> 59:49.310]  Hurry up.
[59:52.230 --> 59:52.910]  Huh.
[59:57.700 --> 59:58.880]  An hotel.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.840]  Little hotel.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.980]  Aw, Zeke, thanks for all the shitload of what's up.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:04.740]  Insane.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:05.920]  Dude, Zeke.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.700]  Zeke Hardshaft went insane today.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.900]  Like, so many people.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.900]  Dude, Crucified Donkey all-timer.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:16.820]  Oh.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.140]  I'm getting tipped.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:22.880]  Geronies!
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:26.380]  Oh, well.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.100]  Thanks for watching.
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.300]  Thanks for watching, everyone.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.280]  You want to watch the VOD of this?
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.560]  It'll be up very soon.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.340]  It'll be up on Tuesday.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.640]  Thank you for watching.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.840]  Gavin is going to make his attempt very soon.
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.960]  I can feel it.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.880]  But until then, we'll see you next time.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.420]  There's a lot of stuff that you probably blinked through and missed in that one,
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.320]  and you missed nothing.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:42.920]  Don't worry about it.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.300]  Yeah, I know.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.400]  Yeah, I let you...
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.440]  Hey, guys, give a shout out to Crucified Donkey.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.480]  Thank you so much.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.500]  And we'll see you next time.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:48.880]  Bye!
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:50.580]  Bye, love you.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.000]  Bye!
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:51.540]  Bye!
