[00:00.000 --> 00:02.260]  I've got one bar of cell phone signal.
[00:03.240 --> 00:04.360]  Sweet. It's like real life.
[00:05.920 --> 00:06.940]  Someone's on Trump mobile.
[00:10.420 --> 00:12.100]  Oh, shit. Nick just popped in.
[00:12.140 --> 00:12.880]  Whoa, that was crazy.
[00:13.360 --> 00:14.020]  I dropped right.
[00:14.140 --> 00:15.780]  Oh, yeah, you dropped right in. That was pretty cool.
[00:16.360 --> 00:18.320]  Connection loss for Geoff.
[00:18.340 --> 00:20.540]  Let me shut the game down.
[00:20.620 --> 00:22.660]  Yeah, do you want to do a full close?
[00:23.100 --> 00:24.620]  Does this game suck like the other one?
[00:25.560 --> 00:26.920]  No, not until today.
[00:28.020 --> 00:29.300]  I've been playing just fine
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.200]  with Bernie and Antonia.
[00:30.900 --> 00:31.980]  Return to hub.
[00:33.540 --> 00:34.700]  Ah, what? Why?
[00:34.720 --> 00:35.280]  Connection lost.
[00:35.420 --> 00:37.760]  Why? Why did you do that?
[00:38.140 --> 00:40.040]  Gavin, why did you?
[00:40.180 --> 00:41.900]  Why did you Gavin do that?
[00:42.040 --> 00:42.940]  Gavin, I have a question.
[00:43.040 --> 00:43.700]  Why'd you do that?
[00:43.960 --> 00:45.220]  Did someone say start it?
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.240]  Start the thing again?
[00:46.600 --> 00:47.380]  No, no.
[00:47.460 --> 00:48.120]  It was talking to me.
[00:51.040 --> 00:52.360]  Oh, you're crazy.
[00:53.200 --> 00:55.480]  Well, I mean, it's not a crazy thing to do if it's not working.
[00:55.760 --> 00:57.080]  I told you it's weird energy, man.
[00:57.640 --> 01:00.860]  Well, Geoff said, I'm going to close my game.
[01:00.900 --> 01:02.580]  And I said, yeah, you should restart it.
[01:03.340 --> 01:06.020]  I just said, yeah, you should restart it.
[01:06.380 --> 01:09.800]  So he thought that was to you from a few minutes ago?
[01:11.320 --> 01:13.240]  I mean, if he's restarted it, we've got time.
[01:13.380 --> 01:14.820]  But what's the...
[01:15.320 --> 01:16.020]  Everyone would.
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.180]  Well, I, uh, I'm, uh, I'm ready to be re-invited.
[01:21.020 --> 01:21.900]  All right, I'll send you an invite then.
[01:22.540 --> 01:25.920]  To quote Gavin as he spoke to Eric unknowingly.
[01:25.920 --> 01:26.840]  Are you an idiot?
[01:27.780 --> 01:30.560]  How did it get hard again?
[01:31.220 --> 01:33.060]  I feel like we had a couple of months there when we first started,
[01:33.180 --> 01:34.700]  where it was easy to make video game content.
[01:35.040 --> 01:37.520]  And then the Achievement Hunter creep has settled in.
[01:37.840 --> 01:39.480]  I think it's specifically trucks and you.
[01:40.140 --> 01:41.200]  Trucks and you is hard.
[01:41.440 --> 01:43.440]  I got to agree with Andrew. Other things are not hard.
[01:43.900 --> 01:44.880]  Yeah, I mean, I've never heard.
[01:45.380 --> 01:47.500]  I've never heard let's play trucks and it go well.
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.060]  Yeah, for Geoff, though, we've had many truck videos
[01:52.060 --> 01:53.560]  where it's just Geoff dropping out.
[01:54.240 --> 01:55.900]  I'm even hardwired in.
[01:55.900 --> 01:58.080]  I just upgraded to a 10 gig switch.
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.220]  So I have faster.
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.020]  I like I don't know what else I can do.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.340]  I mean, it looks like you're in the game now.
[02:04.400 --> 02:06.000]  Yeah, I think it's just a quick resume.
[02:06.560 --> 02:07.360]  All right.
[02:07.620 --> 02:09.800]  I mean, why is Geoff's name look like he's swearing?
[02:10.940 --> 02:12.560]  I think off is censored.
[02:12.800 --> 02:13.820]  It is censored.
[02:14.240 --> 02:16.120]  Yeah, it's the discovery of the last video.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.120]  You can't say off.
[02:18.720 --> 02:18.920]  GG.
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.040]  OK, where's the beginning of the video?
[02:22.340 --> 02:23.620]  I probably started a while ago.
[02:24.360 --> 02:28.020]  Oh, that's it hasn't started a while ago, then it could start now.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.500]  Hello and welcome to another road craft.
[02:29.580 --> 02:32.360]  We got four people here, plus Eric spectating,
[02:32.460 --> 02:35.060]  being our eye in the sky, guiding everything.
[02:35.700 --> 02:36.500]  He's dispatch.
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.480]  He's dispatch world.
[02:38.720 --> 02:41.780]  We did an introductory video a couple of days ago
[02:42.300 --> 02:44.160]  with just Andrew, Nick and I.
[02:44.360 --> 02:47.560]  And then Andrew and I both put, I don't know, I put about 65 hours
[02:47.560 --> 02:48.300]  in the game so far.
[02:48.460 --> 02:49.600]  I think you've got more.
[02:50.040 --> 02:50.280]  And yeah.
[02:51.140 --> 02:54.960]  And then Andrew and then Andrew said we weren't allowed to play this game with him.
[02:55.060 --> 02:56.640]  He wouldn't play with her about a month.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.740]  That's that's exactly what happened.
[02:58.760 --> 02:59.740]  That is factually correct.
[03:00.620 --> 03:04.500]  I was told me as as now.
[03:04.780 --> 03:06.860]  Now we've decided to start a Gavin.
[03:07.540 --> 03:09.080]  So we are starting. I got you.
[03:09.080 --> 03:09.480]  I got you.
[03:09.560 --> 03:12.300]  But with the knowledge of Andrew and I having completed a good.
[03:12.400 --> 03:14.080]  So we need to go to this location first.
[03:14.120 --> 03:17.240]  Gavin is going to this little white point over here.
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.740]  OK, all right.
[03:19.340 --> 03:19.880]  Here we go.
[03:19.920 --> 03:22.820]  I'm so excited for Andrew to see what it's like to be me in trucks.
[03:23.020 --> 03:23.320]  Finally.
[03:24.520 --> 03:26.900]  Oh, I've spent so much time in SnowRunner, too.
[03:26.980 --> 03:28.540]  I just you you're the mother goose.
[03:28.680 --> 03:29.640]  So I just be quiet.
[03:29.800 --> 03:30.680]  I let you lead.
[03:34.580 --> 03:35.380]  Who's honking?
[03:36.460 --> 03:37.380]  It's not. It's not.
[03:38.740 --> 03:40.660]  Yeah, now I think all of us are.
[03:40.700 --> 03:41.300]  Thanks for the reminder.
[03:44.220 --> 03:45.380]  Oh, off to a good start.
[03:46.600 --> 03:47.860]  I like our color palette.
[03:48.420 --> 03:50.740]  Yeah, everyone looks really good.
[03:51.480 --> 03:52.440]  I'm getting out of here.
[03:55.400 --> 03:56.200]  I'm leaving.
[03:56.400 --> 03:58.700]  Yeah, Gavin, shut in the bushes.
[03:59.080 --> 03:59.980]  All right, what's going on?
[04:00.160 --> 04:00.920]  I'll see you fellas later.
[04:01.560 --> 04:03.940]  Hey, Gavin, I have I have one question.
[04:04.160 --> 04:04.720]  I'll race you there.
[04:05.100 --> 04:05.920]  Yeah, I have one question.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.280]  What is the same car?
[04:07.480 --> 04:09.320]  Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[04:09.740 --> 04:12.120]  We made an interesting discovery today about Gavin.
[04:13.060 --> 04:16.240]  So what what is the point of this and what are we doing?
[04:16.360 --> 04:17.460]  And line up, line up.
[04:17.800 --> 04:18.880]  Oh, is it a track race?
[04:19.460 --> 04:20.320]  Andrew and I are going to race.
[04:20.700 --> 04:22.280]  OK. Oh, I mean, we can all race.
[04:22.640 --> 04:23.480]  Is that what road craft is?
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.300]  No, that's what we're making it.
[04:25.600 --> 04:26.620]  Oh, all right.
[04:26.960 --> 04:27.860]  On your mark.
[04:28.480 --> 04:30.140]  Gavin, you want to pull up to the line or you want to start from behind?
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.340]  Yeah, let me let me get.
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.040]  OK, there we go.
[04:32.140 --> 04:33.320]  On your mark. Don't.
[04:33.500 --> 04:34.320]  No, no, no.
[04:34.440 --> 04:35.580]  No, I like a duels race.
[04:35.740 --> 04:36.400]  I like a duels race.
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.620]  Nick and I are buddy buddy too.
[04:39.000 --> 04:39.460]  Let's do duels.
[04:40.180 --> 04:41.880]  It's like a three legged race, isn't it?
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.840]  On your mark, get set, race.
[04:46.320 --> 04:47.320]  Oh, come on, Nick.
[04:47.740 --> 04:49.360]  Come on. Come on.
[04:49.380 --> 04:50.020]  Give me the victory.
[04:50.700 --> 04:52.120]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.100]  Oh, I'm trying to do that.
[04:53.500 --> 04:54.240]  Put some effort in.
[04:54.740 --> 04:55.280]  Hey, Andrew.
[04:55.800 --> 04:57.700]  Yeah, lay in the lane, lay in the lane, let's double lane it.
[04:57.960 --> 04:58.980]  You right lane, me left lane.
[04:59.680 --> 05:00.240]  OK, OK.
[05:00.440 --> 05:00.820]  All right, speed.
[05:00.820 --> 05:01.880]  Some Mario Party style.
[05:02.740 --> 05:03.920]  I had it low. Speed.
[05:03.980 --> 05:04.300]  Oh, there we go.
[05:04.320 --> 05:06.040]  Oh, they're going to get fucked by Bowser.
[05:06.700 --> 05:07.140]  There we go.
[05:07.260 --> 05:07.860]  Oh, too far.
[05:08.120 --> 05:08.520]  Woo hoo.
[05:08.640 --> 05:09.900]  We just got to stay straight.
[05:09.980 --> 05:10.640]  We just got to stay straight.
[05:10.780 --> 05:11.800]  Come on. Where are we going?
[05:11.980 --> 05:12.740]  Oh, OK, we're going to turn around.
[05:13.340 --> 05:14.260]  Wow, we got it.
[05:14.640 --> 05:16.360]  We got it. We had losers.
[05:16.740 --> 05:17.380]  We win.
[05:17.700 --> 05:18.620]  Let's ram him.
[05:19.060 --> 05:19.800]  That was my fault.
[05:19.880 --> 05:21.020]  That's what I'm talking about.
[05:21.260 --> 05:22.720]  That was my fault. I take the blame on that one.
[05:22.960 --> 05:24.280]  You'll never catch me over this.
[05:24.440 --> 05:25.860]  Oh, shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[05:26.880 --> 05:29.640]  Can we try an interesting self-made mission?
[05:29.640 --> 05:31.420]  I'm going to come help you. I'm going to come save you.
[05:31.920 --> 05:33.660]  You want to try something interesting?
[05:34.180 --> 05:35.260]  Yeah. Well, OK, so.
[05:35.360 --> 05:35.840]  We got you, Nick.
[05:36.220 --> 05:37.300]  Don't worry about it, Nick.
[05:37.680 --> 05:38.340]  We got you.
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.160]  Yeah, we got him. We saved him.
[05:41.360 --> 05:41.960]  All right, Nick's good.
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.660]  All right, Geoff, could you catch me?
[05:46.100 --> 05:47.500]  Catch me, I'm falling.
[05:47.580 --> 05:49.160]  Catch me as I go by, otherwise I'll die.
[05:49.180 --> 05:50.260]  Oh, yeah. OK, I landed.
[05:51.060 --> 05:52.060]  OK, here he comes.
[05:52.300 --> 05:52.800]  Geoff, catch me.
[05:53.080 --> 05:54.600]  Geoff, catch him. Geoff, catch him.
[05:54.820 --> 05:56.440]  Geoff. Oh, oh.
[05:57.200 --> 05:58.600]  Oh, he did. Wow.
[05:59.420 --> 06:01.040]  I got you, buddy. Don't worry.
[06:01.320 --> 06:02.140]  I'm going to pull you back up.
[06:02.600 --> 06:03.580]  Wow, that was pretty cool.
[06:05.000 --> 06:05.760]  That was amazing.
[06:06.360 --> 06:06.900]  You live.
[06:08.460 --> 06:09.000]  Oh, no.
[06:09.740 --> 06:10.420]  That was pretty.
[06:10.560 --> 06:11.920]  That was honestly pretty cool.
[06:12.200 --> 06:13.380]  Oh, no, we lost Andrew, too.
[06:13.380 --> 06:15.240]  Yeah, Andrew's down there with with Nick.
[06:15.600 --> 06:17.240]  You guys should go down there with Nick and Andrew.
[06:17.800 --> 06:19.000]  I'm back. I'm getting back.
[06:19.300 --> 06:20.500]  Oh, never mind.
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.080]  They're recovering.
[06:21.700 --> 06:22.420]  We're back.
[06:22.840 --> 06:23.820]  We we recovered.
[06:24.060 --> 06:24.900]  We may have got to do next.
[06:24.980 --> 06:25.780]  No tracked objective.
[06:25.900 --> 06:27.040]  Let's just go into town, I guess.
[06:27.600 --> 06:28.360]  Yeah, let's go to town.
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.940]  So what is the point of this game?
[06:30.980 --> 06:31.880]  What are we doing here?
[06:32.580 --> 06:36.440]  We eventually get missions, but it's largely like you building
[06:36.440 --> 06:41.880]  infrastructure to complete tasks like we deliver stuff and we repair roads.
[06:42.560 --> 06:46.000]  OK, for people that understand truck lore.
[06:46.440 --> 06:50.000]  You know how in SnowRunner your job was to live, to deliver logs
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.360]  and concrete slabs and machine parts from one end of the map to the other.
[06:53.480 --> 06:55.960]  And you had to traverse this just brutal terrain.
[06:56.900 --> 07:00.880]  In this game, your job is essentially to be the guy who fixes that terrain
[07:00.880 --> 07:03.560]  so that the computer AI can traverse.
[07:05.020 --> 07:05.980]  Oh, OK.
[07:06.320 --> 07:07.900]  You do some of it as well.
[07:08.020 --> 07:09.880]  You definitely do delivery missions and stuff as well.
[07:09.880 --> 07:13.760]  But most of it is about improving the infrastructure so that like.
[07:15.100 --> 07:16.200]  And the AI can do it.
[07:16.360 --> 07:18.160]  OK, boy, is the AI dumb, too?
[07:18.480 --> 07:19.700]  Oh, is it real fucking stupid?
[07:21.420 --> 07:22.340]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[07:22.640 --> 07:27.700]  I spent the last 20, 20 minutes racing to get the AI to follow this fucking
[07:27.700 --> 07:30.680]  the easiest route on Earth just so that I could recover my vehicle
[07:30.680 --> 07:33.400]  and not lose some stuff I had going on that we could do.
[07:34.060 --> 07:34.640]  That's good.
[07:34.920 --> 07:36.820]  It's just begging idiots not to be idiots.
[07:37.060 --> 07:37.660]  Oh, I got achievement.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.100]  What's that like?
[07:39.100 --> 07:40.260]  What is it?
[07:40.420 --> 07:41.600]  Free full 15 meters.
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.200]  Oh, way to go, man.
[07:43.280 --> 07:45.840]  I don't know if I have that one yet.
[07:47.540 --> 07:48.500]  Oh, look at this squad.
[07:49.320 --> 07:50.440]  Yeah, it's a pretty solid squad.
[07:51.120 --> 07:51.880]  You guys are looking good.
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.920]  Now, the way that this game is different, Gav, is that there's no gas to worry about.
[07:56.200 --> 07:57.360]  So you don't ever run out of gas.
[07:57.460 --> 07:58.020]  Oh, that's awesome.
[07:58.140 --> 07:59.780]  And there's no damage to the vehicle.
[07:59.880 --> 08:02.020]  So no bonus points for Andrew, unfortunately.
[08:04.520 --> 08:05.660]  How am I going to set a high score?
[08:06.500 --> 08:08.760]  And I was bummed by all of that at first.
[08:08.760 --> 08:10.320]  It was one of the things I didn't like about the game.
[08:10.420 --> 08:11.640]  Also, the winching system is different.
[08:11.740 --> 08:14.440]  But after a while, you understand why and it makes more sense.
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.900]  And you appreciate that they eliminated some obstacles just to.
[08:18.260 --> 08:20.800]  It's got Death Stranding terrain scanning.
[08:21.560 --> 08:22.180]  Oh, yeah.
[08:22.340 --> 08:27.520]  This is this is maybe the first strand type game with full vehicles.
[08:27.780 --> 08:29.100]  Oh, you should let him do it.
[08:29.240 --> 08:30.440]  OK, OK, OK.
[08:30.500 --> 08:31.080]  I'll do it.
[08:31.080 --> 08:32.140]  I'll close it back up.
[08:32.580 --> 08:33.580]  Death Stranding had vehicles.
[08:34.360 --> 08:37.100]  Yeah, but not like the Chevy Silverado.
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.560]  Yeah. Did you see?
[08:39.160 --> 08:39.900]  Sorry, go ahead.
[08:40.280 --> 08:42.180]  Well, I never played up to that point either.
[08:42.560 --> 08:43.060]  Oh, me neither.
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.240]  I just assume there's no Chevy Silverado.
[08:45.700 --> 08:49.520]  Did you see the little news blurb that hit yesterday that apparently they had to go
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.740]  back and change Death Stranding significantly because the playtester said
[08:53.740 --> 08:54.880]  it was too good?
[08:55.100 --> 08:55.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.200]  I've I actually had something similar happen where old girlfriends were like,
[09:00.300 --> 09:02.300]  he's too good at sex, guys.
[09:02.520 --> 09:03.360]  We can't.
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.280]  We can't let this is too.
[09:05.520 --> 09:06.660]  It's too good.
[09:06.660 --> 09:08.340]  Too great a lover.
[09:08.680 --> 09:09.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:09.740 --> 09:12.300]  So it's like, please make the game less fun.
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.860]  It's dangerously fun.
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.680]  It's so cool.
[09:15.940 --> 09:18.920]  Did he change things or did he just complain about it?
[09:18.940 --> 09:22.520]  Because I saw the thing where he was like, people like my game too much.
[09:22.600 --> 09:24.960]  I feel that makes me a bad artist, essentially.
[09:25.400 --> 09:30.580]  Yeah, I think I think that it's a thing where it's just video game news like media.
[09:30.720 --> 09:33.440]  You can just say whatever you want to them and they're going to publish it.
[09:33.520 --> 09:34.680]  And I think that's phenomenal.
[09:35.020 --> 09:36.100]  It's like, what happened to you?
[09:36.100 --> 09:37.040]  It's not even news.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.260]  It's just PR.
[09:38.560 --> 09:38.880]  Where did you go?
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.180]  He created that game.
[09:40.320 --> 09:41.620]  Do you remember that episode of Star Trek?
[09:41.640 --> 09:45.100]  The Next Generation, where everybody was playing that, like, viral game
[09:45.100 --> 09:48.280]  and then they all got addicted to it and they were dying because they couldn't stop playing the video game.
[09:48.340 --> 09:50.140]  Do you think that's Death Stranding 2?
[09:53.880 --> 09:55.680]  That's Death Stranding 2.
[09:57.160 --> 09:58.580]  Gavin, where did you go?
[09:58.620 --> 09:59.600]  I just hit recover.
[10:00.220 --> 10:02.920]  Nick is in the fucking mud and refuses to get out.
[10:03.360 --> 10:04.060]  Gavin recovered.
[10:04.640 --> 10:05.800]  Nick, did you put it in?
[10:07.140 --> 10:07.500]  Yeah.
[10:08.460 --> 10:09.300]  Did you put it in A?
[10:09.940 --> 10:10.280]  Yeah.
[10:11.000 --> 10:11.620]  Low gear.
[10:11.680 --> 10:11.880]  Did you put it in X?
[10:12.220 --> 10:12.420]  Yeah.
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.680]  Did you put it in Y?
[10:13.840 --> 10:15.600]  I was in A, X, Y and I couldn't move.
[10:15.760 --> 10:18.600]  I typically only do X, Y. I'm an X, Y guy.
[10:19.080 --> 10:23.460]  I very rarely use A in this game, but where you are, you probably make sense.
[10:23.500 --> 10:24.780]  You don't have B on, do you?
[10:24.880 --> 10:26.780]  Oh, the tree physics are amazing.
[10:26.920 --> 10:27.560]  I just rolled over.
[10:28.100 --> 10:30.000]  Dude, that's another thing that's great about this game.
[10:30.320 --> 10:33.380]  The trees are your worst enemy in SnowRunner.
[10:33.380 --> 10:35.640]  In this game, you can fuck trees.
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.080]  I sometimes just fuck trees up just to enact petty revenge on trees from SnowRunner.
[10:40.640 --> 10:43.760]  And that's counterintuitive to most games where the tree always wins.
[10:44.140 --> 10:44.220]  Yeah.
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.260]  Or Mind's Eye, where nothing stops you except garbage cans.
[10:49.700 --> 10:50.980]  Can't destroy those.
[10:52.020 --> 10:56.020]  Looking at where Gavin is right now on the map, I think it's going to be a while before he opens the gate.
[10:57.300 --> 10:58.540]  Where is he? Is he back at the start?
[10:59.140 --> 10:59.360]  Gavin!
[10:59.640 --> 11:01.160]  He's worn a little bit.
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.060]  I lit a fire at you.
[11:03.920 --> 11:06.580]  Can I recover to wherever I want, or does it always put me in the same place?
[11:07.180 --> 11:13.140]  You can recover to bases after you unlock them, which is I think what maybe you would be doing here if you made it.
[11:13.140 --> 11:17.160]  So you don't need to worry about it now, but eventually you will unlock a service vehicle.
[11:17.520 --> 11:25.480]  And you can drive that vehicle anywhere you want and recover to that at the cost of that gas can that's currently a zero in the top right.
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.620]  You get those from missions.
[11:27.140 --> 11:31.600]  So you can theoretically recover wherever you want, you just need the service vehicle to be there.
[11:31.720 --> 11:35.240]  Which you'll unlock, not today, but not too far in the game.
[11:36.020 --> 11:36.900]  That's pretty early.
[11:37.220 --> 11:41.040]  I mean, the way you're driving, I don't know that you're ever going to do it, but maybe.
[11:42.680 --> 11:46.160]  Gavin does not want to traverse a road.
[11:46.460 --> 11:47.680]  Can I...
[11:49.240 --> 11:52.760]  Well, I got stuck while I was winched and I couldn't...
[11:52.760 --> 11:55.080]  Am I on a rock? Am I on like a pebble?
[11:56.240 --> 11:57.600]  Do you know how to de-winch?
[11:57.860 --> 12:01.980]  I think you're just kind of stuck. What gear are you in?
[12:02.220 --> 12:05.140]  Even if you get unstuck, you're still not going anywhere.
[12:05.420 --> 12:06.640]  Yeah, no, you're like on a cliff.
[12:06.980 --> 12:08.020]  You're on the side of a cliff.
[12:09.000 --> 12:09.800]  Well, I can come down.
[12:14.480 --> 12:16.860]  Now he's cliff flipping. Okay, he's coming down.
[12:17.560 --> 12:17.800]  Hang on.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.580]  How do you think I got my achievement?
[12:21.920 --> 12:23.740]  Can I see this from my spot?
[12:24.640 --> 12:26.480]  Where am I driving? I'm just driving.
[12:26.620 --> 12:28.960]  Yeah, so am I. It's nice. Relax.
[12:29.540 --> 12:31.220]  I never got this far in the left first move.
[12:31.940 --> 12:32.300]  Whatever.
[12:33.420 --> 12:34.400]  We know what you meant.
[12:35.780 --> 12:36.980]  Well, you probably don't have all-wheel drive on.
[12:38.880 --> 12:39.240]  Gavin.
[12:39.560 --> 12:39.780]  Yeah?
[12:41.500 --> 12:43.720]  He turned on all of his wheels and he started going.
[12:44.300 --> 12:44.840]  He definitely went.
[12:45.600 --> 12:46.020]  There he goes.
[12:46.260 --> 12:47.900]  Gavin taking advantage of the no damage.
[12:49.560 --> 12:51.160]  Finding shortcuts left and right.
[12:51.500 --> 12:51.900]  It is.
[12:54.180 --> 12:54.980]  I'm on the way.
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.920]  He's doing it.
[12:57.200 --> 13:00.020]  Hey, Geoff, have you tried capturing any game background in this?
[13:00.660 --> 13:01.120]  Is it doable?
[13:01.440 --> 13:03.040]  No, I haven't tried.
[13:04.140 --> 13:06.480]  I don't know if he can remove the HUD and stuff, but if he can, I will.
[13:06.960 --> 13:07.580]  I thought I saw...
[13:07.580 --> 13:11.300]  You can't. You just have to turn on hide HUD on off.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.360]  Geoff, I've had an accident.
[13:16.460 --> 13:18.480]  Gavin's upside down. Is that good?
[13:18.980 --> 13:25.880]  In the interest of not watching you recover and then try the same thing again, I'm just going to drive over and help you out.
[13:26.060 --> 13:27.560]  Oh, thank you. That's actually really great.
[13:28.180 --> 13:29.900]  Maybe I'll drive back and help as well.
[13:29.920 --> 13:31.040]  Yeah, I'm heading that way, too.
[13:31.820 --> 13:35.780]  It's going to be like we're going to have to drag Gavin through this mission or we're...
[13:35.780 --> 13:36.080]  Literally.
[13:37.360 --> 13:37.740]  Yeah.
[13:38.800 --> 13:39.880]  What is road craft?
[13:40.720 --> 13:41.360]  But I don't...
[13:41.900 --> 13:44.600]  Oh, I'm liking the water rippling physics, too.
[13:44.600 --> 13:45.780]  It's a pretty game.
[13:47.300 --> 13:48.260]  I don't...
[13:48.260 --> 13:51.440]  I think there's going to be an imprint of my car where I landed.
[13:57.140 --> 13:57.760]  That's it.
[14:01.100 --> 14:01.720]  That's it.
[14:02.300 --> 14:03.960]  Let's figure out where you guys are.
[14:04.760 --> 14:06.060]  Oh, you're down there.
[14:07.100 --> 14:08.300]  Where we are.
[14:08.580 --> 14:10.660]  At the exact beginning of the game. We never left.
[14:13.100 --> 14:13.580]  Okay.
[14:13.580 --> 14:15.340]  I think I see what Gavin did.
[14:26.380 --> 14:28.340]  There you go.
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.500]  So another thing that's different about this game is when you winch, if you're upside down, that's fine.
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.480]  It doesn't... You don't need to be upright to winch.
[14:39.020 --> 14:41.640]  If your vehicle's upside down, you can still do it.
[14:42.640 --> 14:43.580]  Good news for us.
[14:43.900 --> 14:44.460]  Just like real life.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.280]  I will also say...
[14:46.280 --> 14:46.420]  Yeah?
[14:46.420 --> 14:50.520]  Well, I mean, it's the same in SnowRunner if you have an autonomous winch, but...
[14:50.520 --> 14:51.860]  Yeah, it's deep in the game, though.
[14:52.380 --> 14:56.000]  I will say you don't winch much in the game.
[14:56.120 --> 14:58.420]  I mean, I have a feeling Gavin will, but most people don't.
[14:59.920 --> 15:00.420]  I feel like...
[15:00.980 --> 15:03.580]  They've got really good, like, trash in the water graphics.
[15:06.940 --> 15:07.340]  What?
[15:07.820 --> 15:08.040]  Yeah.
[15:08.180 --> 15:10.420]  Like all the floating wrappers and...
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.240]  Oh, okay.
[15:12.240 --> 15:17.100]  He's trying to analyze the parts of the game he's experienced, and it's not much.
[15:17.960 --> 15:20.400]  It's been upside down, one cliff, trash water.
[15:21.500 --> 15:22.900]  All right, here he comes.
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.600]  Gavin, what items do you have on your array of items?
[15:28.020 --> 15:28.540]  X and Y.
[15:29.240 --> 15:29.460]  Okay.
[15:29.860 --> 15:30.820]  That's probably what you want.
[15:31.320 --> 15:31.520]  Yeah.
[15:31.840 --> 15:32.420]  I'm helping him.
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.160]  Giving him little pushes.
[15:33.380 --> 15:34.160]  I'm giving him little pushes.
[15:34.620 --> 15:35.600]  Looking good.
[15:35.700 --> 15:36.240]  Looking good.
[15:36.860 --> 15:37.180]  Look at that.
[15:37.180 --> 15:37.480]  Look at that.
[15:37.780 --> 15:38.860]  Oh, right through the water.
[15:39.040 --> 15:39.500]  There we go.
[15:39.500 --> 15:39.920]  All right.
[15:39.920 --> 15:41.080]  All right.
[15:41.860 --> 15:43.280]  Open this gate up, Gavin.
[15:45.840 --> 15:47.100]  We're making it, we're making it.
[15:47.260 --> 15:47.300]  Let's play.
[15:47.860 --> 15:48.260]  Yeah.
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.600]  The game's going to want you to...
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.460]  This is where the game teaches you how to winch.
[15:52.960 --> 15:53.480]  First time.
[15:54.040 --> 15:54.440]  Nice.
[15:55.240 --> 15:56.780]  Well, Gavin's second, but, you know.
[16:02.510 --> 16:02.910]  So hold...
[16:02.910 --> 16:03.390]  Let him go.
[16:03.890 --> 16:04.610]  There you go.
[16:04.850 --> 16:05.330]  There you go.
[16:05.510 --> 16:06.190]  Just back up.
[16:07.290 --> 16:08.430]  Wow, he opened it.
[16:08.870 --> 16:09.430]  He's done it.
[16:09.430 --> 16:09.590]  He's done it.
[16:11.270 --> 16:11.970]  All right, let's go.
[16:11.970 --> 16:13.290]  Where do you think you're going, Nick?
[16:13.590 --> 16:14.370]  Where do you think you're going?
[16:14.470 --> 16:15.070]  Wait, hold on.
[16:15.290 --> 16:16.030]  I'm going backwards.
[16:16.630 --> 16:16.990]  No.
[16:17.630 --> 16:18.390]  My brake is on.
[16:18.510 --> 16:19.010]  Don't touch me.
[16:20.150 --> 16:20.550]  I'm not stuck.
[16:20.750 --> 16:21.350]  No, Gavin.
[16:21.690 --> 16:22.250]  Oh, you're still...
[16:22.250 --> 16:22.730]  Oh, are you stuck?
[16:22.970 --> 16:23.750]  Gavin, you have to let it go.
[16:23.890 --> 16:24.330]  He's still attached.
[16:24.350 --> 16:25.370]  I was trying to close the door behind me.
[16:27.950 --> 16:29.230]  All right, well, now I can't back up.
[16:30.090 --> 16:31.230]  Yeah, just go forward.
[16:31.550 --> 16:32.390]  Go forward, dumbass.
[16:33.910 --> 16:35.450]  Go through the opening, Gavin.
[16:35.530 --> 16:36.470]  That's how doors work.
[16:37.290 --> 16:38.490]  I think you're doing great, Gavin.
[16:40.290 --> 16:41.850]  You're such a menace.
[16:43.330 --> 16:43.730]  Sure.
[16:44.030 --> 16:44.710]  Why won't it get off?
[16:45.090 --> 16:45.530]  Why won't it let go?
[16:46.390 --> 16:48.090]  Right bumper and...
[16:48.090 --> 16:49.010]  There you go.
[16:49.070 --> 16:49.670]  Look, you can see.
[16:49.730 --> 16:50.450]  You're doing great.
[16:52.430 --> 16:53.230]  You're a driver, Gavin.
[16:53.290 --> 16:54.190]  I love this so much.
[16:55.990 --> 16:56.790]  Jesus Christ.
[16:57.490 --> 16:59.030]  Nick, go through the fucking gate.
[16:59.170 --> 16:59.690]  I'm trying.
[16:59.930 --> 17:00.930]  He winched to me.
[17:01.430 --> 17:02.730]  Let go of me, damn you.
[17:02.750 --> 17:04.070]  You winched to me, you fool.
[17:04.890 --> 17:05.690]  Squeeze through.
[17:06.010 --> 17:06.450]  Oh, I did.
[17:06.510 --> 17:06.790]  You're right.
[17:06.890 --> 17:07.310]  Hold on.
[17:07.350 --> 17:07.810]  Hold on.
[17:07.890 --> 17:09.250]  Don't push me into the thing.
[17:09.250 --> 17:11.450]  Nick was winching.
[17:12.050 --> 17:14.590]  Can you have a winch centipede or just one?
[17:15.070 --> 17:15.650]  Just one.
[17:17.050 --> 17:17.670]  Alright, I'm through.
[17:18.370 --> 17:20.070]  It's doable, it turns out.
[17:20.670 --> 17:21.770]  To drive through the gate?
[17:21.970 --> 17:22.070]  Yeah.
[17:22.230 --> 17:23.050]  Yeah, who knew?
[17:24.890 --> 17:26.690]  I'm getting rammed in the can.
[17:27.310 --> 17:29.790]  The longest it's ever taken anyone to complete that.
[17:29.910 --> 17:31.010]  Objective complete.
[17:32.350 --> 17:33.290]  Oh, a digger.
[17:36.430 --> 17:37.910]  Don't let Gavin use that.
[17:38.950 --> 17:39.850]  He's got to.
[17:40.910 --> 17:42.170]  Alright, what's next, Gaver?
[17:42.850 --> 17:43.430]  Let's see.
[17:44.790 --> 17:46.530]  Clear the way into the plant.
[17:46.730 --> 17:48.890]  Clear the way into the plant or visit the forward base.
[17:49.950 --> 17:51.070]  This is pretty much the same thing.
[17:51.230 --> 17:52.110]  Clear the way into the plant.
[17:53.910 --> 17:55.810]  Let's clear the area of objects.
[17:57.470 --> 18:00.170]  This made me not like the game at first.
[18:01.350 --> 18:02.030]  What's that?
[18:02.330 --> 18:02.850]  This mission.
[18:03.150 --> 18:04.090]  Just trying to figure out how to clear these.
[18:04.110 --> 18:04.390]  Oh, really?
[18:04.490 --> 18:05.750]  I really didn't enjoy it.
[18:05.810 --> 18:06.270]  I didn't get it.
[18:06.270 --> 18:08.630]  We'll go to the FOB first.
[18:08.870 --> 18:10.930]  Can I get in this giant vehicle?
[18:11.250 --> 18:11.750]  You sure can.
[18:11.970 --> 18:13.370]  They want you to.
[18:17.150 --> 18:18.510]  I'm coming through!
[18:20.130 --> 18:22.330]  That didn't work nearly as well as I was hoping.
[18:24.110 --> 18:25.890]  I appreciate the second attempt, Nick.
[18:26.750 --> 18:27.230]  It worked!
[18:28.170 --> 18:29.970]  Alright, we cleared.
[18:30.390 --> 18:32.270]  Now you're going to drive over to that stuff, Gav.
[18:32.370 --> 18:34.070]  And then you can lower your thing.
[18:35.390 --> 18:37.750]  With left bumper and X and Y, I believe.
[18:38.230 --> 18:39.610]  To change your bigger position.
[18:40.570 --> 18:41.090]  There you go.
[18:41.450 --> 18:42.270]  Oh, you're going to scoop me?
[18:43.530 --> 18:45.210]  Oh, give me some scoopage!
[18:48.210 --> 18:50.850]  Okay, go into main.
[18:51.070 --> 18:51.470]  Yeah!
[18:52.690 --> 18:53.090]  Nice.
[18:55.250 --> 18:58.410]  Now, Nick, you just want to winch to anyone and try to get through.
[18:58.890 --> 18:59.850]  Fuck it all up.
[18:59.850 --> 19:01.410]  But I think Gavin's got this figured out.
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.180]  He's basically just shoving those triangles out of the way.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.060]  Yeah, it's just the two.
[19:12.260 --> 19:14.220]  Got to get them out of the rectangle.
[19:16.380 --> 19:18.980]  Can two of us winch a thing at the same time?
[19:19.120 --> 19:21.060]  There's a lot of options for this fricking thing.
[19:21.780 --> 19:23.600]  Yeah, and then in my experience, you only use one.
[19:24.380 --> 19:25.180]  Unable to dig.
[19:26.940 --> 19:27.880]  Get out of it.
[19:28.960 --> 19:29.760]  Nice job!
[19:29.760 --> 19:30.300]  Perfect.
[19:31.860 --> 19:34.220]  You're handling that thing a lot better than I did at first.
[19:34.480 --> 19:34.900]  Absolutely.
[19:35.560 --> 19:37.140]  Oh, we got one more little barrel.
[19:38.740 --> 19:39.200]  Where's the barrel?
[19:40.280 --> 19:41.040]  Gavin's getting it.
[19:41.800 --> 19:42.120]  Oh, okay.
[19:42.340 --> 19:42.580]  Oh!
[19:43.820 --> 19:45.240]  Seems like overkill, but yeah.
[19:46.300 --> 19:47.680]  Did the gate fall off at some point?
[19:48.040 --> 19:49.460]  Yeah, I accidentally hit it.
[19:49.920 --> 19:50.280]  Oh, okay.
[19:51.940 --> 19:52.120]  Oh!
[19:52.820 --> 19:53.100]  Okay.
[19:53.280 --> 19:54.760]  Now, cool thing about the...
[19:56.440 --> 19:56.860]  Track.
[19:59.120 --> 19:59.480]  Oh!
[19:59.740 --> 20:00.100]  Oh!
[20:02.080 --> 20:05.120]  Is Gavin going to take the bulldozer all the way?
[20:05.240 --> 20:05.600]  Ow!
[20:07.740 --> 20:08.100]  Andrew!
[20:08.440 --> 20:09.460]  Sorry, sorry.
[20:10.140 --> 20:13.680]  You can switch between your vehicles pretty easily in this game, Gavin, if you're...
[20:13.680 --> 20:14.620]  Well, you just...
[20:14.620 --> 20:14.980]  I guess you...
[20:14.980 --> 20:16.380]  Looks like you're just taking that one.
[20:17.820 --> 20:18.180]  Is he?
[20:18.960 --> 20:19.360]  Oh, yeah.
[20:19.460 --> 20:21.200]  Yeah, go into marching mode so you can go faster.
[20:21.900 --> 20:23.540]  Yeah, go to marching mode, then you can drive faster.
[20:24.940 --> 20:25.660]  Marching mode.
[20:26.260 --> 20:26.620]  Marching!
[20:26.620 --> 20:26.700]  Marching!
[20:27.480 --> 20:27.900]  Yeah!
[20:29.180 --> 20:31.600]  The most fun thing in this game is building roads, I think.
[20:31.740 --> 20:33.240]  It's also the most frustrating thing in this game.
[20:36.060 --> 20:42.620]  I've spent an embarrassing amount of time building optional roads that have no real purpose, but...
[20:44.060 --> 20:48.140]  I'll find a wrecked piece of land and be like, yeah, this is my next three hours.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.460]  I'm just going to build this road.
[20:49.460 --> 21:01.520]  I did one yesterday where I spent two hours building bridges and roads just to recycle some shit from the northwest end of the map to the southeast end of the map that I didn't need to, just because I wanted to see if I could do it.
[21:02.460 --> 21:03.460]  And eventually I had to give up.
[21:04.300 --> 21:05.940]  I only partially succeeded.
[21:07.620 --> 21:10.300]  That's sort of the fun of it, though, is that you can come back to it if you want.
[21:10.720 --> 21:11.080]  Absolutely.
[21:11.360 --> 21:12.920]  The infrastructure's still there.
[21:14.260 --> 21:19.360]  This is maybe a weird comparison, but it's similar to Blueprints for me, where I'm playing the game when I'm not playing it.
[21:19.880 --> 21:26.680]  I'll be doing something else and thinking about, OK, I'm going to get my sand truck, I can lighten this up, and then, oh, I need to recycle this.
[21:27.160 --> 21:30.820]  I'm sorting things out in my head of what my run is going to be when I return to it.
[21:32.060 --> 21:37.580]  I'm right there with you. I've been streaming this thing in the mornings on my personal account while I drink coffee.
[21:37.960 --> 21:41.780]  And when I go to bed at night, the last thing I think about is, what am I going to do in the morning?
[21:43.800 --> 21:47.960]  And it's like fun because you've got to cycle through and be like, no, I want to do that, but I also want to do that.
[21:48.040 --> 21:49.800]  So you have to pick which thing you want to do.
[21:50.240 --> 21:54.880]  And then there's sort of a layer of like, OK, I'm building this optional road, but what if it's a main mission later?
[21:55.220 --> 21:58.240]  What if I'm doing future work and I don't even know it?
[21:58.740 --> 21:59.860]  Yeah, that's cool.
[22:00.120 --> 22:01.960]  Do you get to romance Kelly in this game?
[22:02.660 --> 22:04.720]  Not from what I've experienced.
[22:05.320 --> 22:11.680]  She's pretty sarcastic with you, which I think I take as her form of flirting, so who knows?
[22:11.680 --> 22:15.440]  Yes, I'm hoping for a Firewatch like turn in the back half of this game.
[22:15.480 --> 22:17.140]  Still like in the middle, never played it.
[22:17.480 --> 22:19.220]  I thought that game sucked.
[22:19.680 --> 22:20.380]  Really, which one?
[22:20.600 --> 22:21.980]  I really like Firewatch.
[22:22.520 --> 22:23.780]  Oh, I never played it.
[22:24.300 --> 22:25.520]  What do you like about it?
[22:25.980 --> 22:27.220]  I like the story.
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.180]  I like the setting.
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.480]  I found the mystery intriguing.
[22:30.800 --> 22:33.640]  I thought it was a wet noodle.
[22:34.500 --> 22:34.860]  Wow.
[22:37.280 --> 22:39.360]  Alright, so we have two missions now.
[22:39.500 --> 22:43.360]  We can build a route to deliver the crane parts to the phosphate plant, which Gavin has to do.
[22:44.580 --> 22:47.380]  Or we could, while he's doing, well, we should all do stuff together.
[22:47.680 --> 22:48.620]  What do you think, Andrew?
[22:48.860 --> 22:50.200]  We should make him do that route thing.
[22:50.540 --> 22:51.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[22:51.520 --> 22:55.840]  Alright, so go to your missions, go to your objectives, Gav, and click on the...
[22:55.840 --> 22:56.740]  You do that by hitting back.
[22:56.860 --> 22:59.140]  Build a route to deliver crane parts to the phosphate plant.
[22:59.300 --> 23:00.520]  Yeah, open that one up.
[23:01.300 --> 23:05.140]  And then click on it with A, and it's going to give you a little tutorial on how to do it.
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.140]  This is how you program the AI to take the routes you build.
[23:10.620 --> 23:13.760]  Do we want to just do some recycling for him while he's doing that?
[23:14.160 --> 23:14.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:16.060 --> 23:16.860]  Some recycling?
[23:17.640 --> 23:25.620]  So you can grab, like, these materials, and you can bring them to the yellow squares, and it will recycle them and make them deployable.
[23:27.360 --> 23:32.800]  Boy, there's something so funny about watching the cars from the mini-map and Andrew being Danny DeVito.
[23:35.140 --> 23:37.060]  Man, this guy's fucking heavy.
[23:37.800 --> 23:39.720]  So what kind of material are we bringing over to it?
[23:40.980 --> 23:47.620]  Anything you can... well, it gets more complicated in the future because it's color-coordinated, but in this one, I think it's...
[23:48.460 --> 23:51.040]  I guess we're not at that stage yet, Geoff. It's not letting us.
[23:51.340 --> 23:51.860]  Oh, okay.
[23:53.080 --> 23:53.840]  It's the second day.
[23:54.380 --> 23:54.860]  Yeah.
[23:57.640 --> 24:00.060]  Do you plant your road down or whatever, Gavin?
[24:01.900 --> 24:02.860]  I... uh...
[24:02.860 --> 24:04.100]  Do you build an infrastructure route?
[24:09.400 --> 24:10.680]  I plotted a route.
[24:12.020 --> 24:12.460]  Uh-huh.
[24:12.760 --> 24:13.260]  Uh-huh.
[24:13.600 --> 24:14.800]  I don't, uh...
[24:14.800 --> 24:16.400]  I think there should be a vehicle, right?
[24:17.020 --> 24:17.800]  Can you deploy a vehicle?
[24:18.120 --> 24:19.760]  I don't see anything moving anywhere.
[24:22.440 --> 24:22.920]  Vehicles.
[24:24.760 --> 24:26.200]  Gotta deploy that thing.
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.120]  Eric, can you see Gavin's screen? Can you help him?
[24:30.760 --> 24:31.080]  Me?
[24:31.420 --> 24:32.100]  No, I can't.
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.800]  I said Eric. Can you see Gavin's screen?
[24:33.800 --> 24:35.620]  I didn't hear him say Eric at all.
[24:35.620 --> 24:36.360]  I didn't see Eric at all.
[24:37.540 --> 24:38.880]  I just heard, can you...
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.080]  I don't know. I don't know how... I just don't know how I would help him.
[24:42.180 --> 24:45.220]  Like, I'm looking at what he's looking at and I have no idea what this game is.
[24:45.440 --> 24:47.920]  I mean, I assume you can read and, uh...
[24:48.640 --> 24:49.960]  Uh, no.
[24:49.960 --> 24:52.090]  I found this very confusing initially, so...
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.130]  It's like, I think coming at it...
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.840]  without playing is tough.
[24:57.320 --> 25:00.260]  Yeah, just build a route to deliver crane parts. Easy.
[25:00.580 --> 25:01.740]  Yeah. That's... yeah.
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.100]  Did you do it?
[25:05.880 --> 25:07.420]  Yeah. Hey. Done.
[25:08.020 --> 25:11.000]  So you click A and you, you like, make these points.
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.580]  Gavin, are you making points? Like, dot to dot points?
[25:14.480 --> 25:16.220]  Yeah. I've done points.
[25:16.660 --> 25:20.780]  And then you have to take it from the one white circle to the other white circle,
[25:20.820 --> 25:23.360]  and then it should say, hey, deploy vehicles now.
[25:24.080 --> 25:24.800]  By pushing A.
[25:26.020 --> 25:26.760]  Oh. Okay.
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.660]  So just make sure that you, like...
[25:30.660 --> 25:31.320]  Where's the other white circle?
[25:31.320 --> 25:32.400]  Connect the dots, essentially.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.080]  It's up there.
[25:33.100 --> 25:34.700]  I see one giant circle.
[25:35.240 --> 25:35.600]  Got that.
[25:35.880 --> 25:36.920]  Maybe zoom out of the map?
[25:38.340 --> 25:38.780]  Cloudy.
[25:39.060 --> 25:39.660]  Yeah, it's very cloudy.
[25:39.660 --> 25:40.520]  Isn't it the phosphate plant?
[25:41.740 --> 25:43.440]  It could be. Maybe, uh...
[25:43.440 --> 25:43.700]  Oops.
[25:44.220 --> 25:44.960]  Ah, shit!
[25:46.260 --> 25:48.400]  He's out of the thing. He switched his vehicle.
[25:57.440 --> 25:57.980]  Okay.
[25:58.360 --> 26:02.740]  Okay, so you gotta go to the abandoned facility,
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.900]  and then you have to go to the phosphate plant?
[26:07.720 --> 26:08.920]  Gavin, you're not tracking the right quest.
[26:10.040 --> 26:11.040]  Well, I'm not now.
[26:13.900 --> 26:14.440]  Okay.
[26:14.440 --> 26:14.560]  Okay.
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.040]  Between the phosphate plant.
[26:22.040 --> 26:22.720]  That's that.
[26:23.040 --> 26:23.200]  Yeah.
[26:23.680 --> 26:24.000]  Yeah.
[26:26.940 --> 26:30.540]  So you just do your connect the dots, and then...
[26:30.540 --> 26:32.000]  See, that's the little route I made.
[26:33.280 --> 26:34.480]  There you go. There it is.
[26:34.760 --> 26:36.080]  Oh, it just didn't go far enough?
[26:36.280 --> 26:37.660]  Oh, I'm watching you make it right now.
[26:38.120 --> 26:38.520]  There you go.
[26:40.120 --> 26:40.740]  Oh, boy.
[26:40.840 --> 26:42.060]  And then...
[26:42.060 --> 26:42.660]  Oh, boy.
[26:43.300 --> 26:44.580]  Is it not that?
[26:45.460 --> 26:47.300]  It's just a less direct route than there are.
[26:47.480 --> 26:47.580]  There you go.
[26:47.900 --> 26:48.680]  But that's okay.
[26:48.900 --> 26:50.040]  Delete entire route.
[26:50.600 --> 26:51.120]  You got it.
[26:51.520 --> 26:51.720]  Yep.
[26:54.580 --> 26:55.020]  Okay.
[26:56.700 --> 26:57.140]  Good.
[26:57.460 --> 26:58.100]  Doing great.
[26:58.660 --> 26:58.940]  Yep.
[27:01.260 --> 27:02.260]  Oh, man, Drew.
[27:02.720 --> 27:04.020]  Is that it? Did you do it?
[27:04.020 --> 27:05.040]  It's a rough one.
[27:07.180 --> 27:08.080]  Nope. Okay.
[27:08.340 --> 27:09.740]  Wait, was that not the phosphate plant?
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.400]  You just gotta put it in the circle.
[27:12.400 --> 27:15.100]  Oh, he hasn't done that.
[27:15.660 --> 27:16.500]  All right.
[27:16.660 --> 27:18.920]  He's spelling.
[27:19.720 --> 27:20.200]  He's writing.
[27:20.620 --> 27:21.840]  Oh, he's writing.
[27:22.560 --> 27:22.660]  F?
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.320]  P? No.
[27:26.580 --> 27:26.960]  What are you doing?
[27:27.700 --> 27:28.000]  F?
[27:30.580 --> 27:31.140]  P.
[27:32.440 --> 27:33.000]  F?
[27:33.680 --> 27:34.700]  F-U?
[27:34.860 --> 27:35.380]  F-U?
[27:35.980 --> 27:36.880]  Fudge, maybe?
[27:37.540 --> 27:38.440]  Oh, I like fudge.
[27:39.080 --> 27:39.660]  Oh, yeah.
[27:40.040 --> 27:40.960]  Chocolatey fudge?
[27:44.420 --> 27:44.900]  Fudruckers?
[27:46.660 --> 27:48.300]  Oh, are you saying you want to go to Fudruckers today?
[27:48.540 --> 27:48.940]  Oh, dude.
[27:49.200 --> 27:50.700]  They don't really exist anywhere anymore.
[27:51.600 --> 27:52.600]  There's one in Branson.
[27:53.400 --> 27:53.520]  Fuse.
[27:53.660 --> 27:54.060]  Sweet, let's go.
[27:54.480 --> 27:54.960]  Fuse?
[27:55.420 --> 27:55.780]  Fuse.
[27:57.540 --> 27:58.960]  Delete entire route.
[28:02.180 --> 28:04.740]  Does it have to be, like, real detailed?
[28:05.540 --> 28:05.760]  Yeah.
[28:05.960 --> 28:06.240]  Yeah.
[28:06.720 --> 28:08.160]  It's more helpful for the dumbass.
[28:08.620 --> 28:09.160]  You'll see.
[28:09.200 --> 28:11.360]  You'll see when they run it.
[28:11.360 --> 28:18.460]  The nice thing about it is you can spectate route, so you can see where it's a problem.
[28:19.060 --> 28:19.580]  You sure can.
[28:19.800 --> 28:22.860]  And on the first run of it, it checkpoints per dot.
[28:24.040 --> 28:24.860]  As it passes.
[28:25.100 --> 28:25.700]  Oh, we're deployed.
[28:25.700 --> 28:26.460]  Did you do it?
[28:26.520 --> 28:26.960]  We're going.
[28:27.080 --> 28:27.760]  Yes, deployed.
[28:27.860 --> 28:28.300]  It's leaving.
[28:28.520 --> 28:29.360]  Let's see how it goes.
[28:29.520 --> 28:30.280]  Okay, so now what?
[28:30.820 --> 28:34.260]  Now it has to drive there, and once it makes it, that's the completed objective.
[28:34.540 --> 28:37.100]  Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[28:37.300 --> 28:38.880]  Sorry, I'm just trying to get by.
[28:39.360 --> 28:40.620]  Why is Andrew going this way?
[28:40.620 --> 28:42.120]  I think Andrew just fucked up the whole thing.
[28:42.140 --> 28:42.460]  That's fine, that's fine.
[28:42.600 --> 28:43.160]  No, it's fine.
[28:43.540 --> 28:44.680]  Okay, well.
[28:44.900 --> 28:46.100]  Okay, so now they're driving.
[28:46.380 --> 28:47.580]  So Andrew fucked up the whole thing.
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.580]  I don't know if that's my fault.
[28:50.120 --> 28:51.800]  What are you talking about?
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.600]  You were in front of the vehicle.
[28:55.680 --> 28:56.020]  It's fine.
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.520]  Yeah, it's sorting itself out.
[28:58.600 --> 28:59.140]  There we go.
[28:59.280 --> 28:59.940]  Okay, we're fine.
[29:00.140 --> 29:00.720]  We're good.
[29:01.180 --> 29:03.640]  I don't know if it's my fault.
[29:03.720 --> 29:04.620]  It's crazy.
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.420]  Well, I didn't see where he put the dots, and sometimes the AI can take some pretty wild turns.
[29:09.420 --> 29:12.120]  So it doesn't necessarily always follow what you put down.
[29:14.820 --> 29:16.280]  These guys are also dicks.
[29:16.280 --> 29:20.220]  Should Gavin still be watching the overview, or should he meet you guys at the phosphorus plant, or what's happening?
[29:20.260 --> 29:20.580]  He can watch the overview.
[29:20.800 --> 29:21.340]  He can do it.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.420]  No wrong answer.
[29:23.300 --> 29:26.720]  I'm spectating the route right now.
[29:26.920 --> 29:28.140]  I'm following the lead.
[29:28.340 --> 29:30.940]  You can get on top of one of the... from the top down.
[29:31.420 --> 29:36.380]  You can highlight one of the trucks that's traversing the route and spectate as them.
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.520]  I'm right behind the first one.
[29:38.520 --> 29:39.000]  I'm watching.
[29:39.140 --> 29:40.280]  Yeah, I'm right here with you, Nick.
[29:40.540 --> 29:41.180]  I'm at the back.
[29:41.220 --> 29:41.500]  You are?
[29:41.940 --> 29:43.180]  In the...
[29:43.180 --> 29:44.280]  Oh, there you are.
[29:46.160 --> 29:47.400]  That was really complicated.
[29:48.980 --> 29:50.820]  It's really not.
[29:51.420 --> 29:53.460]  It presents us complicated at first.
[29:53.780 --> 29:54.440]  No, no, I'm agreeing.
[29:54.540 --> 29:58.280]  It presents us complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, you realize it's distracting.
[29:58.460 --> 30:00.020]  It's deceptively simple.
[30:00.980 --> 30:07.220]  The complicated part ends up being getting them there, like actually following the route that you built and then adjusting it.
[30:07.220 --> 30:08.980]  Look at this moron.
[30:09.340 --> 30:11.360]  Discover how bad they are at taking turns.
[30:11.960 --> 30:13.240]  They're so bad at turns.
[30:13.360 --> 30:13.900]  What is he doing?
[30:14.100 --> 30:14.800]  He's looping?
[30:14.800 --> 30:15.840]  He's bad at taking turns?
[30:15.840 --> 30:16.220]  He's looping?
[30:16.640 --> 30:18.120]  He's crashed into the other one?
[30:18.500 --> 30:21.720]  Did you loop it, Gavin?
[30:22.980 --> 30:23.460]  Gavin!
[30:23.780 --> 30:24.960]  They're looping into me!
[30:25.680 --> 30:27.060]  Nick, get out of the way.
[30:27.220 --> 30:27.780]  I couldn't.
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.260]  Nick just killed it.
[30:29.740 --> 30:30.460]  It wouldn't end.
[30:31.100 --> 30:33.080]  And then I had to go around the other way.
[30:35.120 --> 30:35.820]  That one's stuck.
[30:35.820 --> 30:37.000]  That one's dumb.
[30:37.380 --> 30:37.420]  It's adjusting.
[30:38.180 --> 30:39.980]  I feel like the obstacles are you guys.
[30:40.380 --> 30:42.660]  That one just drove into a tree and knocked it over!
[30:42.980 --> 30:44.580]  Gavin, I agree with you.
[30:44.680 --> 30:48.980]  I think you laid down a great route, and then Nick got in the way, Andrew got in the way.
[30:49.540 --> 30:49.660]  Nope!
[30:49.820 --> 30:54.020]  It seems like the route you've plotted has failed.
[30:54.380 --> 30:56.140]  Yeah, you have to re-initialize the checkpoint.
[30:56.840 --> 30:58.220]  So it'll just checkpoint from where it was.
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.160]  Just hit re-launch.
[30:59.760 --> 31:01.360]  Alright, I'll tell you what, I'm just gonna wait right here and watch.
[31:01.600 --> 31:04.180]  I'm gonna do some minor tweaks while I'm here.
[31:04.500 --> 31:05.440]  I'm gonna go into the bushes.
[31:06.620 --> 31:07.440]  Yeah, I'm gonna...
[31:08.400 --> 31:09.220]  Oh, you can do the route?
[31:10.040 --> 31:10.940]  Anybody can do the route.
[31:11.060 --> 31:12.840]  We wanted you to learn!
[31:12.960 --> 31:13.280]  Oh, really?
[31:15.820 --> 31:16.740]  I didn't know that.
[31:17.000 --> 31:18.020]  Oh yeah, I guess we can.
[31:18.360 --> 31:19.200]  Yeah, yeah, you do the route.
[31:22.320 --> 31:24.400]  You know what? On paper, Gavin, this is nice.
[31:24.780 --> 31:25.260]  This is good.
[31:26.360 --> 31:29.000]  The loop is a little crazy at the end.
[31:31.080 --> 31:33.560]  Yeah, I don't know how that loop's gonna work out, but...
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.520]  I don't think it will.
[31:35.240 --> 31:35.800]  No.
[31:39.870 --> 31:40.710]  Probably not.
[31:42.850 --> 31:48.230]  Unless that's like the platform in Hogwarts and they can just drive through that wall.
[31:49.830 --> 31:51.010]  It's not gonna work.
[31:52.230 --> 31:52.910]  I'm gonna go take a look.
[31:53.070 --> 31:54.110]  It's gonna be a real problem.
[31:56.190 --> 31:57.070]  I'm gonna spectate this.
[31:58.050 --> 31:58.910]  Driving into the...
[32:00.190 --> 32:01.210]  Back of the plant.
[32:03.770 --> 32:04.330]  And...
[32:04.330 --> 32:05.730]  He's confused.
[32:06.750 --> 32:07.490]  He's like, what?
[32:10.010 --> 32:12.130]  Well, I'm following the directions.
[32:12.930 --> 32:15.550]  And that guy's following that guy who's following that guy.
[32:16.710 --> 32:18.410]  And that's how you get World War II.
[32:19.190 --> 32:19.690]  Okay.
[32:20.130 --> 32:20.650]  Jeez.
[32:22.810 --> 32:23.850]  Alright, let's...
[32:24.370 --> 32:26.190]  Cancel the fucking thing and fix it.
[32:29.890 --> 32:34.410]  Alright, I'm just...
[32:34.410 --> 32:37.730]  They do get really pissy with you if you're in the middle of doing something else.
[32:37.870 --> 32:39.910]  Yeah, they're fucking honky and yelly.
[32:41.570 --> 32:45.350]  If Andrew and Nick would get out of the circle where they're about to be...
[32:45.350 --> 32:46.250]  I'm getting him, don't worry.
[32:46.310 --> 32:47.190]  You guys are gonna fail the route.
[32:47.550 --> 32:48.630]  Yeah, I'm getting Nick out of here.
[32:48.670 --> 32:49.630]  I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[32:49.650 --> 32:51.430]  That's weird, it's almost like that happened one time before.
[32:52.010 --> 32:53.170]  That's not what caused the fail.
[32:53.870 --> 32:54.770]  I mean, if you say so.
[32:54.850 --> 32:55.210]  I'm just...
[32:55.210 --> 32:57.730]  All I can see is what happened the first time.
[32:57.730 --> 32:58.430]  I'm working on getting him out.
[32:59.030 --> 33:00.330]  I mean, you're...
[33:00.330 --> 33:02.090]  Nick is completely blocking the route right now.
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.790]  Okay, there we go.
[33:03.950 --> 33:05.030]  I'm working on getting him out.
[33:05.150 --> 33:05.610]  I'm pulling him out.
[33:05.670 --> 33:06.630]  Explain to me how.
[33:06.970 --> 33:07.750]  Explain to me how.
[33:07.770 --> 33:08.990]  It can't drive through you.
[33:09.130 --> 33:10.130]  Maybe it's Gavin's car.
[33:10.410 --> 33:11.390]  Maybe this is Gavin's car.
[33:11.450 --> 33:12.610]  Oh, is that Gavin's car, maybe?
[33:12.750 --> 33:13.490]  Probably Gavin's car.
[33:13.490 --> 33:15.050]  Oh, how interesting!
[33:15.490 --> 33:16.450]  I'm getting Gavin's car out of here.
[33:16.530 --> 33:17.090]  It wasn't...
[33:17.090 --> 33:17.790]  Oh, it's not...
[33:18.710 --> 33:20.330]  It's not Nick, it's Gavin's car.
[33:20.350 --> 33:22.050]  You shouldn't have picked a blue truck, that's Gavin's car.
[33:22.270 --> 33:23.830]  Yeah, I'm still blaming Nick.
[33:24.550 --> 33:25.290]  I'm fine with that.
[33:25.390 --> 33:26.070]  I mean, that works for me.
[33:26.770 --> 33:27.410]  I mean, I'm not.
[33:27.530 --> 33:28.170]  I'm not cool with that.
[33:29.550 --> 33:30.370]  There we go!
[33:30.890 --> 33:31.910]  Did I put my car there?
[33:31.910 --> 33:32.010]  Yeah.
[33:32.790 --> 33:33.990]  You just left it.
[33:36.510 --> 33:37.830]  It is flipped over.
[33:38.050 --> 33:38.690]  Yeah, I got him out.
[33:38.790 --> 33:39.030]  I'll fix him.
[33:40.010 --> 33:40.610]  Good job.
[33:40.810 --> 33:41.170]  Got him.
[33:41.570 --> 33:42.950]  I could just be in that car, couldn't I?
[33:43.410 --> 33:43.650]  Yeah.
[33:43.790 --> 33:44.050]  There we go.
[33:44.370 --> 33:44.990]  And you are.
[33:45.170 --> 33:46.230]  Hold on, we'll get you out.
[33:46.630 --> 33:47.590]  Alright, next mission.
[33:47.790 --> 33:49.090]  Find and recover the generator.
[33:49.390 --> 33:49.770]  Oh, Christ.
[33:50.530 --> 33:50.890]  Yeah!
[33:52.450 --> 33:54.330]  I didn't like this mission either when I discovered...
[33:54.330 --> 33:55.910]  There's another reason why I didn't like the game at first.
[33:56.210 --> 33:57.110]  Let's go to the generator.
[33:57.450 --> 33:57.790]  Really?
[34:00.690 --> 34:08.370]  The only reason I'm playing Roadcraft, I gave up on it, is Andrew was texting me how much fun he was having after I'd given up on it.
[34:08.670 --> 34:09.990]  And I was like, alright, I'll try.
[34:10.130 --> 34:11.570]  And then ten minutes later, I was hooked.
[34:12.990 --> 34:15.390]  I really owe it all to Andrew.
[34:15.690 --> 34:16.010]  I really do.
[34:16.030 --> 34:20.430]  I think it's the first Let's Play we did where I was like, I know I hit the same wall you did.
[34:20.530 --> 34:24.810]  If we can just get through that wall and really get into it, we should have it.
[34:25.070 --> 34:25.410]  It's awesome.
[34:25.410 --> 34:30.110]  We should make a series of videos explaining where the wall is and how to break through it on different games.
[34:30.430 --> 34:30.970]  That'd be fun.
[34:31.070 --> 34:31.930]  That's a good idea.
[34:32.370 --> 34:36.230]  Because I would really like to play Witcher 3, but man, am I hitting the same wall every time I try.
[34:36.310 --> 34:38.110]  I can show you where the wall breaks.
[34:39.330 --> 34:41.650]  It took me three tries. I finally did it.
[34:41.690 --> 34:42.610]  Yeah, make me a video.
[34:43.310 --> 34:43.510]  Okay.
[34:44.550 --> 34:47.110]  I'm just going to go ahead and do this.
[34:48.150 --> 34:48.470]  Probably.
[34:48.950 --> 34:49.310]  Sure.
[34:49.530 --> 34:51.790]  I mean, we're driving that way, or at least I am, I'm assuming.
[34:51.910 --> 34:52.950]  Yeah, we've got a convoy going.
[34:53.430 --> 34:55.690]  It's like six hours of gameplay, but then you're through it.
[34:56.690 --> 34:58.990]  How do I get this goddamn message off my screen?
[34:59.690 --> 35:02.110]  Which message? Maybe hold right on the D-pad?
[35:04.910 --> 35:08.210]  Yeah, it just keeps telling you that you failed the thing, but you already did it.
[35:09.550 --> 35:11.110]  Well, the route still goes.
[35:11.410 --> 35:13.210]  Yeah, it's constantly...
[35:13.210 --> 35:16.030]  Open the infrastructure panel and see what you did wrong. Maybe that'll make it go away.
[35:21.290 --> 35:24.390]  Infrastructure request completed.
[35:27.690 --> 35:28.450]  Nice, Geoff.
[35:31.250 --> 35:32.690]  Oh, object scanner.
[35:33.450 --> 35:34.150]  Whoa, Geoff!
[35:34.710 --> 35:35.670]  Went a little too far.
[35:36.230 --> 35:37.150]  Let's see if I can help.
[35:37.330 --> 35:38.290]  What's our next quest?
[35:38.330 --> 35:41.230]  You should be able to grab my backside and flip... or my...
[35:41.230 --> 35:41.850]  There you go.
[35:42.050 --> 35:43.050]  Grab my backside.
[35:44.030 --> 35:46.910]  If you can grab the other side, I'll do a quick flip.
[35:46.910 --> 35:47.210]  Oh!
[35:55.570 --> 35:57.770]  There you go. That'll get me.
[35:58.350 --> 35:59.250]  Alright, I'm good. Thanks, bud.
[35:59.550 --> 35:59.830]  No problem.
[36:00.710 --> 36:01.970]  How do I get out of here?
[36:03.370 --> 36:04.870]  Knock down another ramp.
[36:08.050 --> 36:08.630]  There's Gavin.
[36:08.710 --> 36:09.110]  Oh, hey, Geoff.
[36:10.350 --> 36:11.770]  Gavin just definitely went the wrong way.
[36:12.930 --> 36:14.510]  He's trapped in the bad spot with me.
[36:14.510 --> 36:16.250]  Oh, you guys are in the bad spot?
[36:17.030 --> 36:17.830]  I'm just gonna recover.
[36:20.310 --> 36:22.410]  I'm assuming this is the generator over here?
[36:23.150 --> 36:23.910]  It's... yeah.
[36:24.250 --> 36:24.970]  The yellow thing?
[36:25.610 --> 36:27.530]  You can do the object scanner to find it.
[36:29.690 --> 36:31.350]  Oh, the object scanner. Right.
[36:31.970 --> 36:32.650]  Oh, thanks.
[36:38.840 --> 36:40.160]  Right under Nick right now.
[36:40.900 --> 36:42.860]  Alright, how to leave this.
[36:43.460 --> 36:44.880]  How to leave...
[36:44.880 --> 36:46.100]  Oh, there it is.
[36:46.100 --> 36:48.100]  How to leave...
[36:49.660 --> 36:50.040]  Okay.
[36:53.180 --> 36:54.940]  Here, maybe I can push it over.
[36:56.200 --> 36:56.980]  That'd be appreciated.
[36:59.320 --> 37:00.120]  Hold on a sec.
[37:00.260 --> 37:01.960]  I'm starting to get a bad angle on...
[37:01.960 --> 37:03.540]  Oh, no!
[37:05.600 --> 37:10.600]  Oh, I have such a good shot of that!
[37:12.040 --> 37:12.980]  What happened?
[37:13.940 --> 37:16.700]  Went over the edge, hanging on Mufasa-style.
[37:25.300 --> 37:27.060]  Oh, I'm Spider-Man-ing!
[37:27.540 --> 37:28.140]  Oh, no!
[37:29.000 --> 37:29.900]  Yeah, you're doing cool.
[37:30.140 --> 37:30.900]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[37:31.020 --> 37:32.200]  That might not be the right way to go.
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.520]  I'm like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 1.
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.780]  You're just like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.
[37:40.440 --> 37:40.840]  What's up, Nick?
[37:42.180 --> 37:42.920]  What's up, you little bitch?
[37:45.860 --> 37:47.840]  Well, I can't winch it, so you do it.
[37:48.120 --> 37:48.880]  What are you doing?
[37:49.280 --> 37:49.680]  Nothing.
[37:50.120 --> 37:50.780]  No touchy!
[37:53.740 --> 37:55.420]  You should be able to winch it now.
[37:56.100 --> 37:56.580]  I got it.
[37:56.780 --> 37:57.800]  I'm stuck on my nose.
[37:58.360 --> 37:58.560]  Yeah.
[37:59.940 --> 38:01.000]  I'm nose-stuck.
[38:02.180 --> 38:02.780]  What's up, Kath?
[38:03.140 --> 38:03.460]  What's up?
[38:04.160 --> 38:04.840]  You going this way?
[38:05.700 --> 38:06.740]  Yeah, I'm gonna help him push it.
[38:09.780 --> 38:11.500]  It's like Fast and Furious 5.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.300]  I'm pulling. Nick, I'm pulling to you.
[38:15.920 --> 38:16.580]  Okay, pull.
[38:16.600 --> 38:17.320]  Keep reversing.
[38:18.660 --> 38:19.700]  I'm coming up.
[38:20.460 --> 38:21.060]  That's Gavin.
[38:21.600 --> 38:23.160]  Gavin, keep reversing.
[38:25.180 --> 38:26.680]  Just the generator!
[38:27.420 --> 38:29.080]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[38:32.900 --> 38:34.140]  You're helping me!
[38:35.160 --> 38:36.680]  I don't think anybody's helping it.
[38:36.840 --> 38:37.200]  Oh, no!
[38:37.340 --> 38:38.360]  I'm pulling to Nick now.
[38:38.360 --> 38:39.900]  I'm getting Nick now.
[38:40.120 --> 38:42.460]  Here, we'll use Gavin as the fulcrum.
[38:44.220 --> 38:45.580]  Ah! It's not working!
[38:46.080 --> 38:47.160]  It's pulling me back!
[38:47.720 --> 38:47.860]  Andrew will die!
[38:47.860 --> 38:49.120]  I'm trying to get up!
[38:49.800 --> 38:50.720]  Andrew will die!
[38:50.940 --> 38:51.900]  No, I'm getting up.
[38:52.500 --> 38:53.060]  We did it!
[38:53.500 --> 38:54.800]  Congratulations, everybody. You did it.
[38:56.220 --> 38:57.880]  It's just us in this mess.
[38:59.180 --> 38:59.780]  We did it.
[39:02.460 --> 39:04.440]  I guess I gotta detach. You're free, Nick.
[39:05.040 --> 39:06.040]  You can rely on us.
[39:06.040 --> 39:09.400]  Thanks, I'm in excellent straits to move.
[39:12.740 --> 39:13.480]  You alright, Gavin?
[39:14.060 --> 39:15.500]  Gavin, you're gonna need to winch somebody.
[39:19.820 --> 39:20.540]  That's me!
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  Alright, hold on, Gavin, I'll get you out.
[39:22.020 --> 39:22.460]  Oh, hey, Geoff!
[39:22.820 --> 39:23.360]  What's up, Andrew?
[39:23.460 --> 39:23.940]  I'll get you out.
[39:23.960 --> 39:24.480]  Nice roll!
[39:25.300 --> 39:25.560]  Thanks.
[39:26.580 --> 39:27.140]  Oh, boy.
[39:27.240 --> 39:28.940]  Okay, here, I'll help you in a sec.
[39:29.960 --> 39:31.040]  I can always just be...
[39:31.980 --> 39:32.700]  That's true.
[39:32.860 --> 39:33.220]  Cover.
[39:34.160 --> 39:34.880]  I'm a big boy.
[39:34.880 --> 39:36.320]  You might want to recover.
[39:36.460 --> 39:37.520]  This is bad in here.
[39:37.900 --> 39:38.580]  Help me!
[39:39.580 --> 39:40.740]  My back wheels are off!
[39:40.740 --> 39:42.260]  I think we need to move on to the crane now, right?
[39:42.960 --> 39:44.160]  Is that what it is?
[39:44.360 --> 39:46.080]  No, we gotta clear, we gotta do another path, I think.
[39:46.760 --> 39:46.820]  Oh.
[39:46.820 --> 39:48.980]  Are these slabs or a route to the generator?
[39:49.300 --> 39:50.800]  You know what, I'll do the route to the generator.
[39:51.380 --> 39:51.640]  Okay.
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.920]  Uh, Gavin, let's try to get back to that area you were at.
[39:57.180 --> 39:58.580]  You know, where the truck's deployed?
[39:59.340 --> 40:00.620]  Where you started the route?
[40:01.480 --> 40:02.600]  Oh, can I just switch vehicles?
[40:04.920 --> 40:05.380]  Uh...
[40:05.380 --> 40:08.380]  You could, but you only have, I think, the tractor, right? Available?
[40:09.140 --> 40:09.300]  Yeah.
[40:10.340 --> 40:11.600]  You can swap that if you want.
[40:12.600 --> 40:14.840]  Oh, what's this? A rusty mobile crane.
[40:14.920 --> 40:15.400]  I'm recovering to the forward base.
[40:16.740 --> 40:17.620]  I'm in a crane.
[40:17.700 --> 40:20.140]  Oh, you're at the cra- yeah! Okay.
[40:20.760 --> 40:21.160]  You're craning.
[40:22.980 --> 40:24.940]  Now Nick's just winched to my corpse.
[40:25.600 --> 40:26.400]  Track...
[40:27.540 --> 40:29.980]  Track, move concrete slabs to the loading area.
[40:30.380 --> 40:30.700]  Okay.
[40:30.700 --> 40:34.060]  So then, uh, hold left bumper, I think?
[40:34.420 --> 40:36.380]  And then up on the D-pad to raise your crane.
[40:37.000 --> 40:37.760]  There you go.
[40:38.140 --> 40:43.280]  And then you follow the instructions, and you want to walk on, you want to connect to these concrete slabs.
[40:44.640 --> 40:47.720]  And then you want to pull them into this square and release them.
[40:51.270 --> 40:54.290]  You can do that by driving, you can do that by moving your crane around.
[40:56.270 --> 40:56.750]  Gonna work.
[40:57.570 --> 41:01.250]  And then just release it, whatever you want, and then it should be good.
[41:02.070 --> 41:03.650]  Looks like I'm dragging a- a wump.
[41:04.090 --> 41:05.430]  It is.
[41:07.410 --> 41:08.350]  There you go.
[41:11.790 --> 41:14.470]  You just gotta pull six of those in.
[41:16.830 --> 41:17.710]  I can- I can help.
[41:19.150 --> 41:19.670]  Oh yeah.
[41:21.050 --> 41:23.250]  Don't worry about it, Geoff. I got this other thing going.
[41:24.230 --> 41:31.930]  So you can use X to cycle between targets, and then you can also cycle between winch points.
[41:32.950 --> 41:35.370]  So you can either go for all corners, or just one.
[41:36.190 --> 41:38.590]  And then right trigger is fire, and left trigger is block.
[41:39.610 --> 41:42.310]  Why does it go limp-dick when I press...
[41:42.830 --> 41:48.830]  So hold right bumper, and then up and down on the D-pad will adjust your limp-dickness.
[41:49.350 --> 41:50.790]  Your... your rope length.
[41:51.750 --> 41:53.510]  Up will reduce the rope length.
[41:55.170 --> 41:56.850]  It's like Viagra for your...
[41:56.850 --> 41:59.250]  Oh yeah, nah, I get it now.
[42:00.250 --> 42:01.130]  Yeah, that checks out, yeah.
[42:03.110 --> 42:04.590]  Are you holding right bumper again?
[42:05.570 --> 42:08.030]  Can you not... get the top one?
[42:08.410 --> 42:14.770]  Oh, fuck off, truck!
[42:16.710 --> 42:17.710]  There you go.
[42:18.690 --> 42:21.190]  How the hell does that... work?
[42:21.510 --> 42:22.350]  How am I doing this?
[42:24.230 --> 42:26.070]  How am I doing this?
[42:29.720 --> 42:30.580]  Andrew, get on.
[42:31.420 --> 42:32.120]  Okay, one sec.
[42:32.180 --> 42:33.120]  Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
[42:33.320 --> 42:34.160]  Let me adjust, let me adjust.
[42:39.160 --> 42:40.320]  Attach my winch.
[42:41.280 --> 42:43.220]  One sec, let me get centered on it.
[42:43.660 --> 42:45.280]  Yeah, get nice and even there.
[42:46.780 --> 42:47.960]  Oh, you're worthless.
[42:49.140 --> 42:50.360]  Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.
[42:50.460 --> 42:51.300]  I'm putting on my parking brake.
[42:52.500 --> 42:53.200]  Pull me!
[42:53.640 --> 42:54.140]  Lift me!
[42:54.620 --> 42:55.120]  Oh!
[42:56.580 --> 42:58.420]  Put your anchors on!
[42:59.280 --> 43:00.120]  Oh, anchors.
[43:00.980 --> 43:01.960]  Anchors coming down.
[43:02.420 --> 43:02.660]  Okay.
[43:02.860 --> 43:05.120]  Uh-oh.
[43:06.520 --> 43:08.300]  You gotta... you gotta reset me.
[43:09.540 --> 43:10.620]  Alright, anchors are on.
[43:12.320 --> 43:13.500]  Alright, now get on again.
[43:14.400 --> 43:16.640]  Well, I need to...
[43:16.640 --> 43:18.500]  Get on again, I'm on my side.
[43:18.580 --> 43:20.320]  Give me a second, I need to get back.
[43:20.420 --> 43:21.860]  Winch to the stick, winch to the womp.
[43:21.960 --> 43:23.880]  Here, I'm winching to the...
[43:23.880 --> 43:25.960]  I can't winch to it because you're attached to it.
[43:26.680 --> 43:27.860]  Winch to the womp.
[43:29.040 --> 43:30.780]  Sounds like the worst song in the world.
[43:32.480 --> 43:33.360]  To the winch!
[43:33.600 --> 43:34.120]  To the womp!
[43:37.460 --> 43:38.400]  Alright, come on!
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.800]  Oh, I flipped you the other way.
[43:39.860 --> 43:40.580]  Okay, it's alright.
[43:40.900 --> 43:41.980]  It's alright, if I hit...
[43:41.980 --> 43:42.700]  You know, it's okay.
[43:43.000 --> 43:43.340]  It's alright.
[43:45.040 --> 43:45.680]  Yeah, maybe...
[43:45.680 --> 43:46.860]  Line up on the other side?
[43:47.660 --> 43:48.180]  Yeah, here, here.
[43:50.120 --> 43:50.440]  Alright.
[43:50.740 --> 43:51.100]  Thank you.
[43:51.800 --> 43:52.580]  Alright, now hold tight.
[43:53.280 --> 43:53.840]  I'll pull you.
[43:58.560 --> 43:59.340]  Alright, what...
[43:59.340 --> 44:00.760]  Maybe just somebody ram into me?
[44:02.400 --> 44:03.220]  I'll just recover.
[44:03.340 --> 44:03.860]  What am I doing?
[44:03.920 --> 44:04.480]  We're right here.
[44:04.600 --> 44:05.300]  I'm just gonna recover.
[44:05.600 --> 44:06.160]  I'll respawn at this point.
[44:06.180 --> 44:07.380]  Also, you know what's annoying?
[44:07.380 --> 44:14.420]  What's annoying is I went to get out of low gear by pressing A and it opened the resource storage, which then turned on my freaking parking brake.
[44:15.860 --> 44:16.800]  That is annoying.
[44:18.060 --> 44:18.540]  Sounds annoying.
[44:18.940 --> 44:19.440]  Good job, Geoff.
[44:20.620 --> 44:21.100]  Thank you.
[44:21.600 --> 44:23.460]  Okay, Gavin, lay that thing down.
[44:23.540 --> 44:24.280]  Lay the womp down.
[44:26.720 --> 44:27.540]  You're womping down?
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.220]  Yeah, womp is dwomp.
[44:29.920 --> 44:30.320]  Okay.
[44:32.240 --> 44:32.940]  This one?
[44:33.380 --> 44:33.500]  Yeah.
[44:35.560 --> 44:36.720]  And curse it down.
[44:37.560 --> 44:38.560]  Anchors down.
[44:40.060 --> 44:40.780]  You ready?
[44:45.110 --> 44:46.630]  You're just... you're pulling it forward.
[44:48.590 --> 44:49.090]  Well...
[44:49.090 --> 44:50.030]  Andrew's upside down again.
[44:50.450 --> 44:51.970]  It was over there.
[44:52.130 --> 44:53.770]  Well, try now, because now it's gonna go straight up.
[44:53.770 --> 44:54.270]  Here, extend your crane.
[44:56.250 --> 45:01.010]  Hold left bumper and then go forward on the right stick, I believe?
[45:03.770 --> 45:04.770]  What the...
[45:04.770 --> 45:05.780]  Why did it...
[45:06.290 --> 45:08.470]  I winched to you and then it just disconnected.
[45:08.690 --> 45:09.350]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[45:10.090 --> 45:10.730]  Hey, man.
[45:10.750 --> 45:11.470]  We're having fun.
[45:12.450 --> 45:12.870]  Andrew's gone.
[45:13.170 --> 45:13.850]  What are you trying to do?
[45:13.990 --> 45:17.030]  I'm trying to get on his womp and then he wants to lift it.
[45:17.570 --> 45:17.750]  Yeah.
[45:19.350 --> 45:20.250]  Alright, get on the womp.
[45:20.510 --> 45:22.370]  I tried this with Bernie and Antonio.
[45:22.490 --> 45:23.070]  We couldn't get it to work.
[45:23.470 --> 45:23.630]  What?
[45:24.270 --> 45:24.790]  That's true.
[45:24.950 --> 45:25.910]  I wish you the best.
[45:26.290 --> 45:27.250]  Maybe you'll have better luck than we do.
[45:28.210 --> 45:29.670]  But he's, like, lining up perfect.
[45:29.850 --> 45:30.290]  Look at this.
[45:30.450 --> 45:31.570]  Here, this is what I'm gonna do.
[45:31.590 --> 45:32.390]  I'm gonna go the other way.
[45:32.770 --> 45:33.810]  I'm gonna put you right in the middle.
[45:34.130 --> 45:34.310]  Oh, yeah.
[45:34.550 --> 45:35.630]  Like a belly slab?
[45:35.890 --> 45:36.730]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[45:36.730 --> 45:37.310]  Belly slab.
[45:39.130 --> 45:40.110]  Right this way.
[45:41.570 --> 45:41.610]  There you go.
[45:41.610 --> 45:43.410]  I'm gonna lay some electrical cable over here.
[45:43.490 --> 45:44.210]  Hope you guys don't mind.
[45:44.490 --> 45:45.130]  Okay, go ahead.
[45:45.670 --> 45:46.010]  Lift me.
[45:47.850 --> 45:48.150]  Oh!
[45:48.490 --> 45:48.890]  Oh!
[45:49.290 --> 45:49.910]  Oh, no!
[45:50.210 --> 45:50.490]  We're taking you!
[45:50.870 --> 45:54.690]  Wait, what if Nick winches to the side of Gavin to help hold him down?
[45:55.250 --> 45:56.030]  Uh, let me see.
[45:59.910 --> 46:01.310]  Let me winch to him.
[46:01.510 --> 46:02.110]  Damn game.
[46:02.110 --> 46:03.710]  Oh, it won't let you winch to that thing?
[46:04.110 --> 46:06.710]  No, I think because Gavin's in a winch state, it won't let you.
[46:06.710 --> 46:08.790]  Oh, we tried.
[46:09.070 --> 46:09.690]  It was a good attempt.
[46:11.250 --> 46:13.510]  You gonna put that slab in and then just release it?
[46:14.510 --> 46:16.130]  We only need one more for this objective.
[46:17.110 --> 46:18.390]  And then you can load us up.
[46:18.630 --> 46:19.090]  Did that work?
[46:19.210 --> 46:19.630]  It didn't work.
[46:19.830 --> 46:21.290]  No, it's not a work.
[46:21.610 --> 46:21.990]  There we go.
[46:23.190 --> 46:24.530]  What the hell is that thing?
[46:25.250 --> 46:26.250]  Uh, it's a cable layer.
[46:29.850 --> 46:30.250]  Whoa!
[46:30.430 --> 46:34.150]  This gives electricity to impoverished towns.
[46:35.510 --> 46:37.830]  Or places that have been cut off by natural disaster.
[46:38.030 --> 46:39.510]  It's a pretty important job.
[46:39.870 --> 46:41.490]  Can I pick up a car with this?
[46:43.370 --> 46:45.010]  Can I make Nick my load?
[46:45.530 --> 46:47.530]  Dude, I picked up an 18-wheeler with that the other day.
[46:47.530 --> 46:48.210]  It's pretty powerful.
[46:48.390 --> 46:49.370]  Please don't say it like that.
[46:49.370 --> 46:53.970]  Just be sure to have your, uh, just be sure to have your supports down.
[46:53.970 --> 46:55.170]  Load me up!
[46:55.170 --> 46:58.750]  I'm gonna go do the optional objective.
[46:58.750 --> 46:59.710]  Oh, crane game!
[47:01.630 --> 47:02.770]  What's the optional objective?
[47:02.770 --> 47:05.430]  Just connect the warehouse base and the forward base.
[47:05.610 --> 47:06.870]  So I'm just gonna drive over there.
[47:07.530 --> 47:09.030]  Take me up. Take me up.
[47:09.510 --> 47:09.870]  How do I?
[47:10.150 --> 47:11.130]  Take me. Take me up.
[47:12.030 --> 47:12.970]  Lift him high!
[47:13.670 --> 47:14.550]  Lift him tall!
[47:15.110 --> 47:15.530]  I got him.
[47:16.670 --> 47:17.750]  I've crane gamed him.
[47:18.450 --> 47:19.870]  I know something I want to try.
[47:20.550 --> 47:21.450]  What do you want to try, Geoff?
[47:22.830 --> 47:24.190]  I'll do it over here with Nick.
[47:24.490 --> 47:26.170]  As soon as Gavin is done with him.
[47:27.470 --> 47:29.390]  Can I put Nick in your bucket?
[47:29.850 --> 47:30.130]  Try.
[47:33.350 --> 47:34.250]  I'm in his bucket.
[47:35.050 --> 47:38.470]  I've never tried to bury somebody in sand. I was thinking of doing that.
[47:38.670 --> 47:39.690]  Oh, that's fine.
[47:39.730 --> 47:40.970]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[47:41.370 --> 47:42.770]  That's a great idea.
[47:43.450 --> 47:44.750]  I want Nick to be in sand.
[47:45.430 --> 47:45.870]  No!
[47:46.710 --> 47:47.990]  Put Nick in sand now.
[47:48.470 --> 47:50.990]  Would we need to be above him, Geoff, to make that work?
[47:51.030 --> 47:52.130]  I hate sand!
[47:53.750 --> 47:54.190]  Ah!
[47:56.090 --> 47:57.030]  Geoff, catch!
[47:57.990 --> 47:58.430]  Ah!
[47:58.430 --> 47:58.750]  No!
[48:01.450 --> 48:03.210]  Put Nick in sand now!
[48:03.630 --> 48:04.010]  No!
[48:05.430 --> 48:07.390]  The sand man is here.
[48:09.270 --> 48:09.950]  Oh, no!
[48:11.370 --> 48:13.310]  Hold on, let me back up.
[48:13.930 --> 48:15.430]  Oh, let me die!
[48:15.690 --> 48:16.770]  I'm going to creep show him.
[48:17.090 --> 48:19.510]  I didn't know you could bully people in a truck game.
[48:20.370 --> 48:21.750]  Oh, my God, you can bully people in anything.
[48:22.190 --> 48:23.070]  This is great.
[48:24.070 --> 48:25.250]  I'm going sideways.
[48:26.350 --> 48:27.590]  Alright, let me know when to drop, Geoff.
[48:28.970 --> 48:29.870]  Not yet.
[48:30.190 --> 48:31.850]  Not yet, let me get better.
[48:32.050 --> 48:34.670]  Yeah, I think if you line up, I think you'll get it.
[48:35.270 --> 48:35.890]  I can spin.
[48:35.990 --> 48:37.010]  I got an achievement for this.
[48:37.550 --> 48:38.030]  Nice!
[48:38.350 --> 48:39.050]  You got an achievement?
[48:39.890 --> 48:40.950]  I didn't read it.
[48:41.730 --> 48:42.330]  You're too scared.
[48:43.650 --> 48:44.570]  He's just screaming.
[48:45.130 --> 48:45.390]  Ah!
[48:45.550 --> 48:46.450]  It's dark powers!
[48:47.410 --> 48:48.510]  He's in the dirt.
[48:49.150 --> 48:49.470]  Ah!
[48:50.390 --> 48:50.770]  Ah!
[48:51.310 --> 48:53.170]  Nick, put your brake on Nick.
[48:53.650 --> 48:54.130]  Ah!
[48:55.770 --> 48:56.250]  Ah!
[48:58.430 --> 48:58.670]  Ah!
[49:01.490 --> 49:01.970]  No!
[49:03.490 --> 49:03.970]  Ah!
[49:04.450 --> 49:05.310]  That's so good.
[49:06.170 --> 49:06.770]  Nick's stuck.
[49:07.890 --> 49:08.990]  Yes, I am.
[49:09.170 --> 49:10.110]  That's so cool.
[49:10.630 --> 49:12.490]  Can I drive out of this?
[49:12.530 --> 49:12.870]  Let me see.
[49:13.770 --> 49:14.250]  You can try.
[49:15.630 --> 49:16.110]  Wait.
[49:16.330 --> 49:16.650]  Nope.
[49:19.890 --> 49:21.370]  Oh, this is awesome.
[49:21.530 --> 49:21.670]  Hello?
[49:23.050 --> 49:24.130]  Can we do a heist?
[49:25.090 --> 49:26.550]  We can do it right now.
[49:27.110 --> 49:27.390]  Hey!
[49:28.430 --> 49:29.650]  I'm not things, I'm people.
[49:30.430 --> 49:32.390]  Can I nickel this shit from over the fence?
[49:33.510 --> 49:34.090]  You can try.
[49:36.030 --> 49:36.670]  I've never tried.
[49:36.950 --> 49:40.970]  That is the infrastructure you put in there, so you should be able to take it out.
[49:42.090 --> 49:42.870]  Oh, I did that?
[49:43.010 --> 49:43.510]  Oh, shit.
[49:44.670 --> 49:47.010]  Well, by putting it in the yellow things, it just...
[49:47.270 --> 49:48.890]  That's where...
[49:49.950 --> 49:51.270]  Nick, get out of my truck.
[49:51.550 --> 49:52.310]  I'm trying!
[49:52.890 --> 49:54.750]  He's just in the back.
[49:54.790 --> 49:55.850]  My wheels are just spinning.
[49:55.850 --> 49:58.530]  You might have to go somewhere where you can tip.
[49:58.710 --> 50:02.590]  Like, you can be, like, tilted backwards, so that way when you tilt more...
[50:02.590 --> 50:03.090]  Take me to the hill.
[50:03.350 --> 50:03.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:03.770 --> 50:06.130]  You've got to be on, like, the hill, facing up the hill.
[50:06.190 --> 50:06.870]  And then you've got to tilt.
[50:07.690 --> 50:08.350]  Two-wheeling!
[50:08.690 --> 50:09.250]  I'm edging!
[50:10.290 --> 50:10.650]  What?
[50:10.930 --> 50:11.570]  He's edging?
[50:15.010 --> 50:15.590]  I'm edging!
[50:16.270 --> 50:17.210]  This is a good video.
[50:20.550 --> 50:21.630]  This game is great.
[50:21.770 --> 50:22.330]  Let's see what's going on.
[50:22.410 --> 50:23.370]  Yeah, this game is great.
[50:23.370 --> 50:25.560]  It's very funny when you, like...
[50:26.150 --> 50:27.510]  There's so much you can do.
[50:28.010 --> 50:30.130]  It's like SnowRunner, but your ideas work.
[50:30.770 --> 50:30.910]  Yeah.
[50:31.170 --> 50:33.710]  Yeah, dude, what a great way to put it.
[50:36.030 --> 50:37.690]  I'm pretty stuck like normal.
[50:38.070 --> 50:38.850]  Oh, my God!
[50:38.870 --> 50:39.690]  Nick's getting dumped!
[50:40.430 --> 50:41.430]  Oh, yes, free me!
[50:42.250 --> 50:42.850]  Let me out!
[50:43.210 --> 50:43.810]  Let me out!
[50:44.110 --> 50:44.970]  Let me out!
[50:45.410 --> 50:46.150]  Let me out!
[50:46.150 --> 50:47.010]  Do you want me to lift him out?
[50:48.250 --> 50:49.490]  Let's see if this works first.
[50:49.610 --> 50:50.690]  Get your own little ass out.
[50:51.490 --> 50:51.970]  I'm trying!
[50:54.350 --> 50:55.250]  Let me...
[50:55.250 --> 50:55.690]  Yeah!
[50:55.870 --> 50:56.170]  No!
[50:58.050 --> 51:00.490]  From the top rope!
[51:02.090 --> 51:03.410]  I got him.
[51:09.970 --> 51:11.230]  Bad ass.
[51:13.110 --> 51:14.890]  That's a dump truck right there.
[51:17.090 --> 51:17.870]  Wrecking ball!
[51:18.550 --> 51:19.290]  Wrecking ball!
[51:25.420 --> 51:26.140]  Oh, Christ.
[51:26.600 --> 51:27.060]  Hi, Andrew.
[51:27.200 --> 51:29.280]  Are we got any missions or anything to do, or what are we doing?
[51:29.520 --> 51:34.280]  Yeah, we just did the optional thing, and then we got a new main mission, I think.
[51:34.720 --> 51:36.640]  I'm just trying to put a hat on.
[51:37.260 --> 51:38.640]  You were my last hope!
[51:38.760 --> 51:39.440]  Where have you gone?
[51:39.520 --> 51:39.920]  I recovered.
[51:40.100 --> 51:40.620]  I just recovered.
[51:40.740 --> 51:41.320]  Nick, you can recover.
[51:41.440 --> 51:42.260]  It's right up the hill.
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.260]  We got to bring the resources to the phosphate plant.
[51:46.600 --> 51:47.440]  Sick sun visor.
[51:48.440 --> 51:48.660]  Okay.
[51:50.760 --> 51:53.180]  Gavin, could you put some of this shit on me?
[51:54.260 --> 51:55.040]  Yeah, hold on.
[51:55.180 --> 51:56.360]  Let me just put my hat on.
[51:56.980 --> 51:59.280]  I need three concrete slabs.
[52:00.420 --> 52:03.320]  Oh, you need to get me a bigger hat than yours.
[52:03.420 --> 52:04.320]  I need a top hat.
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.180]  You want a...
[52:06.940 --> 52:08.100]  Oh, your hat!
[52:08.440 --> 52:09.760]  You don't want my hat?
[52:10.340 --> 52:13.460]  I'll take your hat if you're fine with letting me borrow it.
[52:13.940 --> 52:16.760]  But I'm going to need three hats worth of hat.
[52:17.540 --> 52:17.900]  Okay.
[52:19.100 --> 52:21.780]  I need a solid three whomps on my head, please.
[52:24.060 --> 52:25.980]  Why is that main quest not done yet?
[52:28.100 --> 52:31.320]  I think it's because we got to bring resources to it.
[52:31.420 --> 52:33.200]  Is that above you?
[52:34.260 --> 52:34.740]  No.
[52:35.040 --> 52:35.940]  Not really, no.
[52:36.740 --> 52:38.840]  What do you got there?
[52:38.940 --> 52:40.240]  What are you loading up Andrew with?
[52:40.860 --> 52:45.900]  He's giving me some slabs, a.k.a. whomps, a.k.a. hats.
[52:46.440 --> 52:48.600]  So then I'll do the...
[52:49.100 --> 52:51.320]  So that's terribly placed.
[52:55.020 --> 52:56.660]  Wow, that looks great, Andrew.
[52:57.060 --> 52:58.200]  You're a ramp car now.
[53:00.060 --> 53:01.260]  GTA, look out!
[53:02.500 --> 53:03.760]  Alright, do you want me to reposition it?
[53:06.860 --> 53:08.080]  Maybe I can on you...
[53:08.080 --> 53:08.940]  No, the whomp!
[53:09.080 --> 53:09.200]  Here.
[53:10.840 --> 53:11.720]  Let me...
[53:12.220 --> 53:14.180]  Let me release it. I don't want to grab it.
[53:14.820 --> 53:15.940]  I'll swap vehicles.
[53:20.060 --> 53:22.960]  Here, put a hat on this one. I'm driving over to you.
[53:24.740 --> 53:26.220]  I accidentally got a barrel.
[53:27.240 --> 53:30.660]  You can put a barrel in as well, that's fun. Donkey Kong style.
[53:31.520 --> 53:33.560]  Alright, you want me to load up that with hats?
[53:34.120 --> 53:36.360]  Yeah, you can put one on my head if you want.
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.160]  Give me nice shade. Keep me cool in these missions.
[53:45.080 --> 53:47.400]  Let me get out of your way, I feel like I'm blocking you.
[53:47.660 --> 53:49.500]  You get that whomp and then pull it up.
[53:56.220 --> 53:58.380]  Why is it obsessed with this barrel?
[53:59.180 --> 54:02.240]  Click X on the... you can cycle targets.
[54:03.180 --> 54:05.900]  Either hold left bumper and X or hold right bumper.
[54:06.820 --> 54:08.140]  Oh yeah, you can.
[54:08.700 --> 54:09.880]  I like that.
[54:10.020 --> 54:11.520]  Oh, you got his truck, you got his...
[54:11.520 --> 54:12.700]  You gonna put me in me?
[54:13.080 --> 54:15.420]  You wanna be on yourself?
[54:15.580 --> 54:16.820]  Yeah, put me in me.
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.560]  Anchors, Gavin! Anchors, Gavin!
[54:22.440 --> 54:23.300]  Anchors, Gavin!
[54:23.300 --> 54:25.400]  Oh, Gavin, you're getting plowed by the AI!
[54:25.540 --> 54:26.880]  Oh, those are the AI cars!
[54:28.780 --> 54:29.320]  These guys are crazy.
[54:29.320 --> 54:30.660]  They're trying to do their job!
[54:31.200 --> 54:33.100]  Stop it, they're bullying me!
[54:35.520 --> 54:37.440]  I'm trying to get out of your way, man!
[54:38.420 --> 54:40.980]  Stop driving forward, I can't...
[54:40.980 --> 54:44.780]  Maybe you guys shouldn't have planned that in the middle of the route.
[54:45.180 --> 54:46.580]  At the exact end of the route.
[54:47.520 --> 54:49.360]  Alright, Andrew, get under yourself.
[54:49.580 --> 54:52.800]  I can't because this AI car is bullying me!
[54:52.800 --> 54:55.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:55.780 --> 54:58.140]  He's getting fucking beat up.
[54:59.400 --> 55:01.480]  He's laying on the horn!
[55:01.800 --> 55:04.240]  For some reason, Nick is here now too.
[55:04.600 --> 55:06.200]  Why is he magnetly...
[55:06.200 --> 55:07.680]  Why is he following you?
[55:07.800 --> 55:09.160]  He's stuck on me!
[55:09.260 --> 55:09.740]  Oh, my God.
[55:10.700 --> 55:11.460]  Oh, man.
[55:13.540 --> 55:14.840]  Now he wants some of Gavin!
[55:15.160 --> 55:16.200]  Gavin, lift the Hummer!
[55:16.380 --> 55:16.580]  Get over, son!
[55:16.840 --> 55:18.420]  Lift me! Lift me!
[55:18.520 --> 55:19.540]  This is all...
[55:19.540 --> 55:20.980]  Oh, the route failed!
[55:21.200 --> 55:21.920]  Okay, put me...
[55:21.920 --> 55:23.400]  Oh, hey guys, that route failed.
[55:23.700 --> 55:25.800]  I'm gonna restart it while you put me in me.
[55:25.880 --> 55:28.620]  I can do it since I'm just sitting around.
[55:29.280 --> 55:29.980]  Here we go.
[55:31.180 --> 55:33.220]  Oh, they spawned right here again!
[55:33.320 --> 55:34.220]  They want more revenge!
[55:36.380 --> 55:38.320]  Yeah, they're gonna spawn where it failed.
[55:38.980 --> 55:40.460]  Gavin, put me in me, hurry!
[55:43.160 --> 55:45.660]  I assume a problem because that's what you guys are doing around.
[55:48.940 --> 55:50.060]  I'm strapping it!
[55:51.100 --> 55:52.500]  Cannot secure cargo.
[55:52.720 --> 55:53.820]  All right, hold on.
[55:53.840 --> 55:54.440]  Hold on.
[55:54.700 --> 55:56.320]  I gotta get out of the way of these idiots.
[55:59.960 --> 56:01.980]  They won't stop chewing me up!
[56:02.200 --> 56:02.780]  I know!
[56:03.040 --> 56:03.780]  That's what happened to me!
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.320]  Okay, get out of there.
[56:05.460 --> 56:05.880]  They gave up.
[56:07.440 --> 56:09.820]  They won't stop chewing me up.
[56:10.420 --> 56:11.300]  Oh, shit, I folded up my...
[56:12.040 --> 56:13.540]  It snapped so hard!
[56:13.580 --> 56:14.220]  Oh, shit.
[56:14.680 --> 56:15.460]  Oh, they're back!
[56:16.080 --> 56:16.900]  They're moving me out of the way.
[56:16.920 --> 56:18.520]  We left Andrew there.
[56:18.520 --> 56:19.940]  Yeah, moving me.
[56:20.140 --> 56:20.360]  Okay.
[56:20.580 --> 56:20.800]  Okay.
[56:22.080 --> 56:22.840]  There we go.
[56:23.220 --> 56:24.240]  These will cash out now.
[56:28.680 --> 56:29.700]  Oh, my anchors!
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.300]  Oh, your anchors gotta anchor up.
[56:34.980 --> 56:38.080]  On my screen, you are anchored in a very bad way.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.400]  Yeah, mine too.
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.360]  All right, hold on.
[56:40.380 --> 56:41.680]  Let me draw some of this in.
[56:42.200 --> 56:43.060]  I think you're doing great.
[56:46.600 --> 56:47.600]  I've just got to...
[56:47.600 --> 56:50.460]  Oh, I'm just gonna ram you, I think.
[56:50.460 --> 56:52.260]  Yeah, you hit him from the other side.
[56:52.500 --> 56:53.780]  Yeah, you got it.
[56:54.460 --> 56:56.140]  I'm using Andrew as my weight.
[56:56.340 --> 56:56.520]  Oh, there we go.
[56:56.520 --> 56:57.240]  There we go!
[56:57.320 --> 56:57.860]  All right, count.
[56:58.860 --> 57:04.840]  Yeah, when I'm in that car, Gavin, and when I flip in it, I use the crane to pick myself back up when possible.
[57:06.080 --> 57:08.420]  All right, let me rotate my load.
[57:09.000 --> 57:09.460]  I'm parked.
[57:09.460 --> 57:11.160]  I'm wedged into Gavin.
[57:12.320 --> 57:14.080]  All right, is that good positioning?
[57:14.220 --> 57:15.900]  Not even kind of good.
[57:16.480 --> 57:17.480]  Not even close.
[57:17.480 --> 57:19.020]  I think it's awesome, man.
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.220]  I think you're fucking nailing it.
[57:20.220 --> 57:21.800]  Can you not see?
[57:26.140 --> 57:30.280]  That seemed like a fuck you.
[57:36.340 --> 57:37.320]  It's kind of insulting.
[57:37.560 --> 57:38.480]  All right, let's move it this way.
[57:38.780 --> 57:39.380]  There we go.
[57:39.460 --> 57:40.280]  That's a lot better.
[57:40.680 --> 57:42.520]  Okay, lower it a little bit so you can...
[57:45.280 --> 57:47.540]  The cable, not the...
[57:47.540 --> 57:48.560]  You don't need to lower the...
[57:48.560 --> 57:48.860]  Okay.
[57:49.420 --> 57:50.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:51.440 --> 57:51.780]  Okay.
[57:52.440 --> 57:53.540]  Look at that.
[57:54.760 --> 57:56.160]  Oh, it won't let me secure it.
[57:57.780 --> 57:59.080]  Release, release the cable.
[58:02.950 --> 58:04.770]  It won't let me secure it, unfortunately.
[58:05.450 --> 58:06.490]  Can you just winch to it?
[58:09.030 --> 58:10.610]  I don't have a winch in this.
[58:11.930 --> 58:13.530]  Let's see if I can just drive with it, though.
[58:14.570 --> 58:15.790]  Yeah, here, I'll tell you.
[58:15.930 --> 58:16.690]  Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[58:16.730 --> 58:17.270]  You're doing it.
[58:18.350 --> 58:20.410]  Let me put on the diff lock so...
[58:20.410 --> 58:21.090]  Oh, we're moving.
[58:21.090 --> 58:22.750]  Oh, no, it's sliding down the...
[58:22.750 --> 58:23.830]  I'm dragging it.
[58:24.070 --> 58:25.430]  I'll help you, I'll help you.
[58:25.570 --> 58:27.090]  I got a one-wheel...
[58:27.950 --> 58:30.330]  It's like I got a backpack over one shoulder.
[58:30.990 --> 58:31.550]  I'm pulling.
[58:31.590 --> 58:32.470]  Yeah, you look cool as shit.
[58:32.990 --> 58:33.570]  You're back in high school.
[58:33.570 --> 58:34.010]  Oh, this is awesome.
[58:34.510 --> 58:35.970]  I'm going home in my car.
[58:36.510 --> 58:37.090]  In my car.
[58:46.170 --> 58:47.210]  That was awesome.
[58:47.350 --> 58:47.750]  It flipped.
[58:47.850 --> 58:48.470]  It's still going.
[58:48.710 --> 58:49.390]  We're still good, we're still good.
[58:49.450 --> 58:50.150]  It's still locked in.
[58:52.270 --> 58:54.890]  I'm going to loop this back around so I can show Gavin his work.
[58:55.650 --> 58:56.010]  Okay.
[58:57.330 --> 58:59.130]  Oh, tip, I lost it.
[58:59.350 --> 59:00.990]  Maybe, no, we're still...
[59:00.990 --> 59:01.970]  No, okay, yeah, it's gone.
[59:02.810 --> 59:04.850]  All right, well, let's give it a try.
[59:04.950 --> 59:06.050]  Here, Gavin, let's hat me up.
[59:06.350 --> 59:08.050]  Let's go to the slab so you can hat me up.
[59:10.370 --> 59:12.150]  Geoff is just playing the game.
[59:12.250 --> 59:12.810]  Yeah, he's...
[59:12.810 --> 59:14.470]  I'm just watching Geoff play the game.
[59:15.490 --> 59:16.090]  The rest of this is...
[59:16.090 --> 59:16.630]  What am I doing in the game?
[59:19.110 --> 59:20.090]  Geoff's doing the help stuff.
[59:20.090 --> 59:21.810]  Just doing the real work.
[59:21.930 --> 59:22.930]  Probably not as the developer intended, yeah.
[59:24.630 --> 59:25.210]  Andrew needs a hat.
[59:25.490 --> 59:26.050]  I need a hat.
[59:26.050 --> 59:27.110]  I'm pretty sure I saw that on the quest.
[59:28.250 --> 59:29.190]  You guys are having...
[59:29.190 --> 59:33.010]  Listen, the main objective of this game is to be fun and to have fun.
[59:33.390 --> 59:35.150]  So if you guys are doing that, then you're playing the game right.
[59:35.630 --> 59:36.430]  Hey, Geoff, will you give me one?
[59:36.590 --> 59:37.210]  No, not at all.
[59:37.270 --> 59:37.610]  Stay away.
[59:37.850 --> 59:38.610]  Gavin, I want a hat.
[59:38.670 --> 59:40.510]  I thought he was going to blast right into you.
[59:40.510 --> 59:41.370]  But I want a top hat.
[59:41.390 --> 59:42.010]  No, I wasn't.
[59:42.130 --> 59:46.250]  There's no way on earth you and that truck could take this anywhere.
[59:46.550 --> 59:47.170]  Anchors, Gavin.
[59:47.730 --> 59:48.050]  Anchors.
[59:48.050 --> 59:50.350]  You wouldn't even be able to secure it to yourself.
[59:50.770 --> 59:52.070]  Yeah, I got winches.
[59:53.230 --> 59:54.210]  Well, winch to Geoff.
[59:54.910 --> 59:55.510]  No, do not.
[59:55.610 --> 59:57.530]  Okay, now let me adjust to you a little bit.
[59:58.650 --> 59:59.090]  Make it easier.
[59:59.130 --> 59:59.270]  Oh, it won't let me.
[01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:01.230]  Okay, you gotta raise it higher.
[01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:05.310]  We need some height on this top hat.
[01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:07.670]  I'll run interference, Geoff.
[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:08.890]  I'm good.
[01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:11.750]  Can you bring the crane up higher with the left... up on the D-pad?
[01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:13.950]  Is running interference mean interfering with me?
[01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.270]  Yeah, I'm getting out of your way.
[01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.110]  No?
[01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.790]  He stopped directly in your way. That was awesome.
[01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.230]  Yeah, I bumped into something.
[01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.450]  Nick's like, don't worry, I'll interfere.
[01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:26.830]  Oh, Geoff!
[01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.010]  Did you see that shit?
[01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:28.690]  Tokyo Drift.
[01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.950]  Yeah.
[01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.010]  Route failed.
[01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.430]  That was awesome.
[01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:34.770]  Oh, is that as high as you can get?
[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:41.110]  Maybe.
[01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:41.750]  What about this?
[01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.410]  I don't think we're gonna get vertical with that.
[01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:46.850]  Nah, you guys are doing great.
[01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:49.910]  What if I park higher up on the top of a building?
[01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:52.510]  Yeah, I could be lower than you.
[01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.030]  Do you have a car nearby?
[01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.770]  Uh...
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.110]  Oh, God.
[01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:01.870]  Can you swap your car for a second and then I can just adjust this a little bit for you?
[01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.030]  That's alright, we're good.
[01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:04.650]  Where did my car go?
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.550]  Is it this?
[01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.250]  No, that's Geoff.
[01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.470]  You can get in my car.
[01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:14.070]  If I have any available cars in there, you can get in them.
[01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:15.590]  Where did I go?
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:17.610]  Did someone spin me off?
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:20.990]  Who's this down here? Is this me?
[01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:22.830]  I'm upside down in the middle of nowhere.
[01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.110]  Why is the map upside down?
[01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.430]  Spin it.
[01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:27.710]  Shut up.
[01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.650]  Okay.
[01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:30.870]  You can spin it.
[01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.170]  Oh, no, sorry, Geoff. I was talking to the truck.
[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.570]  No, no, no, no, no. It wasn't you, Geoff.
[01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:36.370]  Yay!
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.490]  Good job, everybody.
[01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.690]  Alright, boys!
[01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:40.110]  What a win!
[01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.670]  Couple of champions right there.
[01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.050]  That's the next thing you drive, actually.
[01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.990]  Wow! Way to go, boys!
[01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.910]  Hell, yeah.
[01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:51.330]  I just want a top hat.
[01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:55.690]  I'll go fix the...
[01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:56.850]  Here, wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:00.650]  It's pretty cool what I'm doing, Eric.
[01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:05.330]  Oh, no, I mean, you're playing the game, you're winching, you're whipping stuff around.
[01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:06.830]  I was going to say, if you wanted to see it for a second, just because it's, uh...
[01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.050]  Yeah, I mean, you look great. You've been doing a great job.
[01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:10.790]  It's a pretty cool...
[01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:11.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:12.350]  Pretty cool mechanic.
[01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.350]  Hey, Geoff, do I have to drive?
[01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:16.070]  You're at the dock doing cool stuff.
[01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:20.010]  Oh, really?
[01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.110]  Uh-huh.
[01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:21.930]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:23.810]  Okay, I'm in.
[01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:25.330]  That's awesome.
[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:26.130]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.750]  Are you, like, building a wall?
[01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:36.130]  Who are the people?
[01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.970]  Oh.
[01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:45.570]  It's a long way back.
[01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:48.450]  So, can stuff break?
[01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:51.770]  Like, Gavin is, like, whipping stuff around in a...
[01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:53.430]  Like, a big truck or whatever.
[01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.490]  Like, these seawall pieces that you have, Geoff.
[01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:56.890]  Can, like, these things break?
[01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:58.070]  I don't think so.
[01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.590]  Okay.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:09.280]  Those birds.
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:10.840]  Boo!
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.660]  Pull the cable in.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.060]  So, right bumper...
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.060]  What?
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.360]  Right bumper...
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.820]  That's as short as the cable gets.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:22.440]  Thank you.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.220]  Where is the bird?
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.620]  I... Andrew, why don't you move?
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.160]  Because...
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.720]  I don't...
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:33.980]  Okay.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.940]  He is in more than a good enough position to do this.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:38.600]  It's not.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.780]  I'm, like, sloughing down the hill, so I'm at the same height as you.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.820]  There's no way you're the same height.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:48.340]  You're so much taller, and you're using no height on this crane.
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.900]  No, I know, but turn your head.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.180]  No, I know, but it's the central point of you're not using any height.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.520]  Here, let's swap.
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.500]  Let me give you a hat.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.940]  I'm getting in a different vehicle.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.480]  You hop in that vehicle, and I'll hop in the crane.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.700]  I'll give you a top hat.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.860]  Okay, are you in the...
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:08.760]  Yeah.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.640]  Okay.
[01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.390]  What's up?
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:29.350]  I'm good.
[01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:40.770]  Oh, cramp.
[01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:42.490]  Cramp?
[01:04:43.690 --> 01:04:44.450]  Route failed.
[01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:48.210]  Hired goons.
[01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.850]  You know, if you...
[01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:53.430]  I know you know how to play this game, Andrew.
[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:59.610]  But I was just going to say, if you switch your load attach mode to the four corners, it might be easier to place.
[01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.490]  I'm trying to get this vertical, so...
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:04.350]  Oh, okay.
[01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.630]  Well, then that'd be the opposite of easier.
[01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:06.290]  Yep.
[01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:07.610]  He's trying to do a forehead.
[01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.530]  Good treatment.
[01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.230]  Nice way to go, dude.
[01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:12.610]  Goal complete.
[01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:16.770]  Do you go for a tall hat?
[01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:20.150]  Going for a tall top hat on the top of his car.
[01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.650]  Do you want to reverse a little bit, Gavin?
[01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.850]  Doing it.
[01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:33.310]  Do you know, Geoff, if he can strap from the vehicle part, or is it only the bed?
[01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.470]  I think it's only the bed.
[01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:36.770]  I think it's only the bed, too.
[01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.370]  I don't think it's going to work, but...
[01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:39.430]  But he can try.
[01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:43.550]  The second you release it, if he hits Y, it's going to be the problem.
[01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:45.350]  That's fine.
[01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.850]  That's fine.
[01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:47.270]  Hey, all right!
[01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.770]  Beat the map, boys!
[01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:50.150]  All right.
[01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:55.850]  Like, if you let go and Gavin hits left bumper and holds left bumper right now, and then hits Y...
[01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:56.950]  Okay, so hold left bumper, Gavin.
[01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.230]  Do you see where it says...
[01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.550]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:58.610 --> 01:05:59.850]  I'm about to release it.
[01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:00.770]  Okay.
[01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:04.050]  Three, two, one.
[01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:04.990]  Releasing.
[01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.550]  Nope.
[01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:08.710]  Didn't work?
[01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:09.030]  Okay.
[01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.530]  Here, let me...
[01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:13.530]  Let me put this in your back.
[01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.430]  Pretty sure I pressed it.
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:18.070]  Yeah, I just don't think it'll secure from the top of the car.
[01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:19.190]  I think it has to be in the bed.
[01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:21.610]  Let's get it in the bed.
[01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.530]  Like, it'll strap like that.
[01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:26.770]  Yeah, let me just do this fucked up so he can see.
[01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:28.570]  So, left...
[01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:29.510]  Yeah, let's do it again.
[01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.230]  The second he lets go, left bumper and...
[01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.510]  Okay.
[01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.030]  Ready, Gavin?
[01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:33.730]  Yep.
[01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:36.530]  Oh, you didn't count down.
[01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.950]  I said ready, and then I assumed that meant you were ready.
[01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.390]  No, I'm with Gavin.
[01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:42.190]  I'm with Gavin.
[01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:42.870]  Should've been a countdown.
[01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:45.390]  Should've been a countdown.
[01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:46.490]  I'm with Gavin 100%.
[01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:47.290]  Gavin, I'm with you.
[01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:47.670]  You were right.
[01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:52.310]  Let me get close to T.
[01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:53.330]  Sure.
[01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:55.250]  I'm here as well.
[01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:56.770]  Hey, guys.
[01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.810]  Oh, you two get next to each other.
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.030]  Go bed to bed.
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:02.710]  Oh, you can't.
[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.090]  Never mind.
[01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.750]  Never mind, Nick.
[01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.550]  You can't strap.
[01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:08.290]  I was curious if you could both strap one piece.
[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:09.870]  Huh.
[01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.370]  Yeah.
[01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:11.630]  Oh, I can try it.
[01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:12.610]  Go for...
[01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:12.870]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:13.470]  Yeah, I guess you can.
[01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:14.270]  Geoff, go on the other side.
[01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:15.710]  Shall I back up to you?
[01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.290]  No, you two get closer.
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.090]  No, you get closer to me, Gavin.
[01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:18.930]  Drive forward.
[01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.350]  And then, Geoff, you know how to line up next to me.
[01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:23.470]  Oh, my parking brake was on.
[01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:25.090]  Yeah, that happens.
[01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:27.750]  Let me move this a little bit.
[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:33.910]  Are you just trying to glue us together?
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.270]  Yeah, I just want to see what happens if I put it half and half.
[01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:39.610]  All right, so I'll align our beds.
[01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:41.690]  Oh, wow.
[01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:42.950]  You mailed that through the slot.
[01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:45.890]  That was pretty cool.
[01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.810]  How did you do that?
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:47.970]  That was pretty impressive, honestly.
[01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:49.310]  Let's lift that.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.420]  I mean, watching you control the crane, I don't feel bad about my crane controlling.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.180]  No, no, no.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.500]  I thought you did great, buddy.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.240]  It's one sec.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.740]  Drop it and then...
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:07.420]  A lot easier.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.740]  I'm actually going to go to...
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:14.300]  Yeah.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.240]  The route failed.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.880]  It just keeps failing in the background.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:28.980]  He's moving me.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:30.740]  Oh, yeah, that's fair.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.180]  That's fair.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.860]  You guys both want to try to...
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.260]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.260]  Holy shit.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:39.740]  Wow.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.380]  I can't believe that worked.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.580]  Geoff, did you know you could do this?
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.740]  Okay, I'm going to go forward.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.020]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:50.740]  This is a game changer.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.380]  It's me and my best man.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.240]  This is like wearing a get-along shirt like you two are fighting.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.920]  Tell you about my best man.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.080]  This is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.100]  So, wait.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:12.680]  If we put Nick on this upside down, could he strap it?
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:15.880]  Yes, maybe.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.480]  Andrew, I need a lift.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.200]  Yeah, one sec.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.580]  Do I need to flip over first?
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.220]  We don't have the ability to strap in that vehicle.
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:26.460]  Yeah, get a strappable.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.200]  You can strap me.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.340]  Yeah, but can you strap me?
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:29.440]  Maybe.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.080]  Well, it wouldn't let me strap...
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.520]  We don't want to unstrap the womp.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.260]  Well, what if I land on the womp?
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.720]  I bet I could ride between them.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.720]  I don't...
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:38.740]  Get a...
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.280]  Does he not have a strappable vehicle?
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:42.600]  Let's...
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.060]  Let's go to the crane.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.520]  Let's go to the full crane to do this.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.440]  So, I can utilize that.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.800]  Where's the full crane?
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:49.420]  Oh, at the dock?
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.240]  At the dock, yeah.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:50.940]  Let's head to the dock.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:51.180]  Alright.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.160]  This is...
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.480]  Sneakers out of here.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]  Should I change vehicles?
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.060]  Uh, no.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:05.780]  Back up now.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.080]  You're good.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.020]  We're gonna back up.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.560]  There we go.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.620]  There we go.
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:09.080]  There we go.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.480]  Keep going.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:09.840]  Keep going.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.280]  We're doing good.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:10.700]  We're doing good.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.120]  We're doing good.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:11.460]  We're doing good.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.740]  Alright, let's go ahead and forward.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.500]  Let's go ahead and...
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:17.980]  Cover.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.080]  Gavin, if you can do this, you can get your driver's license.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:21.660]  I have no doubt.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:25.140]  This is...
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.620]  I can't believe this worked.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.640]  Yeah, that's insane.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:33.300]  It's like the other game, but with no limits.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.600]  Yes, it's limitless.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.480]  I wonder if the developers know that this is possible.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.360]  I'm just trying to think if there's a long enough piece of infrastructure to get three of us.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:43.940]  There is.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:44.680]  Maybe a steel beam?
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.360]  One of those yellow pipes with the...
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:47.560]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.020]  One of those black pipes with the yellow around it is super long.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:50.840]  Yeah, that's so long.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.620]  It's just so heavy.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.740]  Yeah, but we could definitely go against three.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:55.900]  Oh, for sure, yeah.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.900]  The length is perfect.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.360]  And I bet that crane you have, the rusty crane,
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.760]  or whatever they were using here, would do that.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.440]  If not, we have better ones.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.080]  So could you strap either end of a long thing and have, like, a limbo bar?
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.060]  Uh, yeah, you could...
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.080]  I mean, theoretically, anything is possible
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.620]  with connection based on what we just did.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.060]  I've made it to the dock.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.640]  Okay, I'm right behind you, Nick.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.040]  I'll, uh, scoop you up in a minute.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.060]  We'll be there in about six... months?
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:22.620]  Hours.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.880]  Two... two miles an hour.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.160]  So it might take us a bit, but we'll get there.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.500]  We're just not leaving the base.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.360]  Aw, Geoff, your...
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.300]  Your birthday present got refunded.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:36.940]  Oh, thanks, man.
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.100]  Maybe I bought it wrong.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:39.940]  Aw, you don't have to give me anything.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.000]  No, I'm getting you something.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:42.360]  Aw, thank you.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:45.700]  Uh...
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.020]  That was a little easy to put Nick on now.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.320]  Holy hell!
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:54.600]  The best part about this, too, is that none of the...
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:56.500]  The fun stuff is building the roads.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.260]  I mean, this is fun, too.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.520]  No, this is fun. This is more fun than it is.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:04.760]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.420]  I'm excited for building roads now because this is not that fun.
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.080]  But it is that fun today.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.980]  Can't do this in GTA.
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:14.400]  No, you can't.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.000]  Where are you?
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.080]  They fucked us on the tow trucks in GTA multiplayer.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.520]  Yeah, well, it kind of broke the game, didn't it?
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.060]  Yeah, dude.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.900]  Seeing you guys from the minimap is so funny.
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.140]  Oh, I didn't even think to look at the minimap.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.960]  I mean, you guys could have towed us a little bit for speed, right?
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:36.060]  Yeah, here, let me push you from the back with this dozer.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.600]  Oh, this is great from the menu.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.080]  Eric, check this out.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:43.980]  Okay.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.420]  Okay.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.340]  I mean, it looks cool.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.700]  It's like playing Tonka trucks.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.480]  Like, this is micromachine shit.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.340]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.920]  Road Crap's SnowRunner has the best top-down map in video games.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:12:59.820]  It's pretty cool.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:00.680]  They're fantastic.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.600]  What was that game where you had to destroy buildings to keep the car from hitting things?
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:06.440]  Andrew, what happened?
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.860]  I got my thing all stuck.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.960]  Oh, you mean keep destroying buildings and your car doesn't explode?
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:12.860]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.880]  That's what it was called.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.440]  It looks like someone threw Andrew, like, a lawn dart.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.840]  I got stuck in the... okay, let me go to manual control.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.160]  The gap is widening, Andrew.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.220]  Yeah.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.540]  We're having some problems over here.
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:26.800]  Andrew's doing an indo.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.000]  You just pulled yourself forward.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:28.360]  That was awesome.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.140]  I looked back and Andrew was doing an indo.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:30.780]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.140]  Yeah.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.620]  He was stuck in the ground.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.320]  He's getting it.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.000]  I'm coming.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:34.680]  Here he comes.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.260]  At great speeds.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:41.400]  Andrew's yet to catch us.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.260]  I don't think he does, though.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.960]  It's like it follows.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.120]  Yeah.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.060]  Real Michael Myers scenario.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.160]  Yeah, Michael Myers from It Follows.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:56.600]  He just won't stop fucking.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.020]  That dude, that thing is pretty big in It Follows.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.000]  Oh, the big... yeah.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.500]  He's terrifying in It Follows.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:06.880]  Oh!
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.560]  Which way, Geoff?
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.240]  Almost there.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.180]  We're gonna take a right.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.480]  Oh, God.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.840]  There's a truck right behind Andrew.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.340]  And then we're gonna take...
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.260]  Andrew's running interference first.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:19.880]  And then we're gonna take this first left.
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.840]  Oh, he's gonna do it.
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.780]  Oh, he's trying to go wide.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.020]  Oh, look out!
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:26.540]  Andrew!
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.120]  Oh, no.
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.260]  And there's another guy.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:29.980]  Hey, we got double.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.020]  Oh, we got double AI coming!
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.180]  Oh, they're so mad.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.580]  We got the whole squad pushing.
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:40.840]  We got everyone going!
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.400]  This is... guys.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:43.200]  Go!
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.840]  The ultimate truck.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.880]  The timing of that was absolutely unbelievable.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.940]  No, truck centipede, why?
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.220]  Oh, that was so good.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.740]  You don't have your brake on by any chance, do you?
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:02.940]  No.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.260]  Yeah, we're pushing, truck.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.280]  Calm down.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280]  Andrew, I don't think you've pushed us a single time.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.180]  Oh, here comes another one!
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.180]  I've been shoving the whole way.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.460]  You're not touching us.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.480]  Yes, I am.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:16.180]  I'm against you, stupid.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:17.720]  Well, I'm not against anything.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.800]  On my screen, you're not touching me.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.820]  On my screen, I'm in the mix.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:22.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.280]  You're not touching him on his screen and you're not touching him on mine.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:26.400]  Or mine.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:27.480]  Oh, mine.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.540]  I'm right in there.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.340]  But that's okay.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:30.520]  That's fine.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.540]  Oh, now you might.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.760]  Why is this guy on the right following along?
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.020]  I don't even think this is his path.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:37.840]  He's helping.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:38.580]  Oh, he's stolen.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.040]  He's stuck.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.760]  He's stuck to this.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.720]  We nixed him.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:44.740]  He's like, this is not my route.
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.700]  Can Andrew lift him onto you and then me onto him?
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.580]  No, he'll despawn.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.540]  He'll disappear, yeah.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.020]  Oh, damn.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.500]  How did that look, Nick?
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.240]  Us coming in?
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.060]  Uh, from the...
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:55.260]  Oh.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.180]  Slow?
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.140]  Yeah.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.180]  Okay.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.000]  I'm getting in the crane.
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.800]  Oh, the crane dropped me.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.240]  I guess when I swafted it.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.800]  We shouldn't get right under it like this, should we?
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:10.940]  Yeah.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.440]  That's fine.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.880]  Oh, Andrew, what if you put...
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.060]  What if you put the...
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.320]  Yeah, I can do that as well.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:16.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:17.520]  Let's just start with you.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:18.480]  Okay.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:22.520]  Fellas!
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:25.940]  Hello!
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.720]  I love that Nick is in it.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.080]  I love that I can see Nick in it.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.160]  It's me!
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:31.000]  Oh!
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:31.560]  Oh!
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.540]  Sorry, it's, uh...
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.220]  There's a lot of different controls in this thing.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:37.040]  Yeah.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.820]  And you very rarely use it, so it's hard to remember them.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.860]  Uh, usually like once a map.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.120]  I wonder if we...
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.840]  I don't want to de-
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.760]  I wonder if we de-strapped and re-strapped if we would strap Nick.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.800]  Oh, do we want to risk a de-strap there?
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.800]  Isn't that the point?
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:52.520]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.000]  I thought that's what we were doing.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.020]  I de-strapped.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.380]  And detaching.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.300]  De-strapped.
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.380]  Re-strapped.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:16:59.720]  Re-strapped.
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:00.720]  No.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.220]  No, but I'm...
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.220]  Based on how my wheels have been positioned before,
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.520]  I'm pretty well wedged.
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.420]  We just need Nick in a strappable vehicle there.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.080]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.140]  One sec, one sec.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:10.940]  Oh, God.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:13.660]  Uh...
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.140]  Uh-oh.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:15.740]  Uh-oh.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:16.320]  What did you grab?
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.960]  He grabbed all of us.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:18.780]  Oh!
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.060]  Oh, take us up!
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.140]  You're too heavy.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:22.460]  Wow.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.140]  Too heavy.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:24.980]  We foiled the crane.
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:26.640]  I can pull you.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:29.880]  Oh!
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:30.700]  Oh!
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.160]  Oh!
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:31.460]  Ah!
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.220]  I'm doing everything I can here.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.960]  That's as far as we're going to get for height.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.300]  Can we overlap the two cranes?
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.700]  No, I can't double winch.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.620]  Well, one of us could go grab the other.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.660]  It'd have to be you.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.420]  If Gavin or I leave, I think we lose our strap.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.000]  Yeah, Nick, could you get in?
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.220]  Yeah, you get in the other one.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:51.880]  Let me detach.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.780]  Yeah, so one strap to me and one strap to Geoff.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.360]  Yeah, and then we'll do that.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.120]  You guys are going to have to be more central.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.400]  I think you're going to have to drive over.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.900]  I think we should leave Nick on, though.
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.240]  Because then Nick can come in.
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.360]  I think the weight might be too much.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.320]  But we can try it.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.180]  You can leave me there.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:11.580]  It might work.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.720]  Yeah, we'll leave you there and see if it works.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:14.900]  But I think it might be too much.
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.780]  This video is so crazy.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.200]  It's so long.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.560]  So much has happened.
[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.860]  Remember when Gavin was upside down?
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.540]  Like, what is going on?
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.340]  So one grab me, one grab Geoff.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.260]  Yeah, let me swing over.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.840]  How do I...
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.800]  There we go.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.840]  Andrew, you might need to swing the other way.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.600]  Because we're going to collide!
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:43.580]  We'll figure it out.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:44.640]  Okay.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.100]  Oh, you know what? Then hold on.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.080]  Let me let go of him.
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.240]  I'll go for Geoff.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.500]  Okay, yeah, I'll spin the other way.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:51.420]  Okay.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.720]  It's alright, you got it.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.300]  No, no, just stay there.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:53.900]  Just stay there.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:54.640]  Stay where you were.
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.560]  And then when it's lifted up, Nick can get back in his car.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.580]  I think it might drop you then.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:04.800]  You're only giving me Nick at the moment.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.740]  Let me adjust.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:06.660]  There we go.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:07.720]  Okay, I got Gavin.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:08.700]  Okay.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:09.980]  You got Geoff?
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.320]  I got Geoff.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.040]  You ready?
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:12.580]  Let's pull.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.620]  Up we go!
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:16.460]  Yes!
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.820]  And we got him!
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.500]  Yes!
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.040]  It's a record!
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.220]  It's a lifting record!
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:30.340]  That is a thing of beauty.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.220]  I'm pretty impressed with the way...
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:36.700]  Oh, the crane is freaking out on my screen!
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.000]  The crane is going nuts.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.320]  I'm pretty impressed with the way you guys play video games.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.440]  Nick, Nick, Nick, you thinking what I'm thinking?
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:45.960]  Yes.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:47.540]  Yes!
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.860]  He just said yes!
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:52.700]  Spin it.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.980]  Spin it to the C.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:55.720]  Yes.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.780]  Spin it to the C.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:57.520]  Spin it to the C.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:58.820]  Let's pull him at C.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:19:59.740]  Lift!
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.440]  Lift up!
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.360]  Nick's gotta lift.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:03.000]  He's not lifting.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.160]  I am lifting!
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.380]  I'm going the wrong way.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.680]  The entire time you guys have been playing this,
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.220]  Gavin has just had the...
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.380]  It seems the route that you've plotted has failed.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.160]  It has been on his screen.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.840]  I just stopped looking at it and then looked back.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:18.540]  Wow.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.660]  It's just been there the whole time.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.640]  It became invisible to me.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.240]  Yeah.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.680]  Take them to the C!
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:24.540]  Lift!
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.440]  It's going!
[01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:31.080]  Ah!
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.620]  So Nick, you can't get back in your car now?
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.740]  It would be so awesome if you could drop us on that.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.700]  We were just...
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:42.460]  A gift for Poseidon.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.160]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:47.280]  See?
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.200]  Are you in it?
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:48.640]  Oh!
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.440]  Oh my god!
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.700]  Guys, I'm back!
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.200]  I'm trying to pull you onto the beam!
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.280]  I can't see, my camera's in the C!
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.460]  We should buy stock in whoever makes these straps.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.260]  Yeah!
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.140]  I think that's the perfect place to end this video.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.100]  Yep.
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.120]  Pretty great.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.820]  Well, there you have it.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:39.040]  Thank you for watching Roadcraft with the Regulation Boys.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.700]  I hope this is the first...
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.620]  Technically, it's our second video, but it's the first in this world.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.620]  Hopefully the first in a long series of Roadcraft-related shenanigans.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.580]  I'm excited for them to find this wreck in 60 years.
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.540]  Alright, keep on the lookout for more Roadcraft.
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:01.580]  I promise we'll make it.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.140]  We'll see you later.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:02.860]  Crazy.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:03.500]  Bye!
