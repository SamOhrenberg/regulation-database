[00:00.000 --> 00:08.960]  We're back on limbo. I managed to get to the hotel with more than five deaths. So we'll
[00:08.960 --> 00:14.960]  start again. Once again, it's been way too long, I don't remember anything.
[00:15.900 --> 00:20.560]  Now, Gavin, for those that may not have watched the last video or been here for the first
[00:20.560 --> 00:24.320]  time, what is it you're trying to do here? I'm trying to get the achievement, which is
[00:25.480 --> 00:33.580]  called... where are achievements anymore? No point in dying. Complete the game in one
[00:33.580 --> 00:38.500]  sitting with five or less deaths. So, and this all came from an idea that you
[00:38.500 --> 00:44.000]  had, that we do something, and then we quickly turned it around on you, and now you're doing
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.820]  this. Yeah, I was just spitballing with the lads,
[00:47.940 --> 00:54.200]  like, what about this idea? You said, do it now, do it, do it now. Didn't have even the
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.500]  second wheel filled in, and then I got yelled at, and now I'm playing limbo.
[00:58.060 --> 01:00.300]  And is this the second time you've attempted this?
[01:01.340 --> 01:04.700]  No, this might be the third. Third? I missed the first two.
[01:04.920 --> 01:11.420]  Yeah. But we are live, Jorky Bilfus is here and gifting subs. Thank you, Jorky Bilfus.
[01:11.420 --> 01:14.840]  Oh, thanks, Jorky. Thank you, Jokerman, also. We appreciate
[01:14.840 --> 01:17.260]  everyone here. If you guys remember the name Jorky Bilfus
[01:17.260 --> 01:19.940]  from a previous stream, I think we determined that was Gavin's enemy.
[01:20.220 --> 01:24.180]  Yeah, we said that Gavin wasn't here because Jorky Bilfus was here, but then Gavin
[01:24.180 --> 01:27.280]  showed up after Jorky Bilfus was here, so now maybe they're on good terms.
[01:28.100 --> 01:29.840]  I don't think there was any love lost between the two of them.
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.520]  No, I agree. As far as I was aware, I'm a big Jorky Bilfus
[01:35.520 --> 01:38.820]  guy. Okay, well, Wes the Rad gifted five subs
[01:38.820 --> 01:43.560]  and so did Phallic Swab. So, kind of everyone can do it. Jack the Blumkin
[01:43.560 --> 01:47.780]  King also gifted a sub. Sort of everyone can. And the Dr. Mouse, guys.
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.800]  Drunken Mouse. The Dr. Mouse, he's a doctor and he's a mouse.
[01:51.380 --> 01:55.820]  It's Luminite, did it as well. Yeah. I want to thank everyone who tuned in.
[01:56.000 --> 01:58.920]  We went live a little bit early because we didn't know if this was going to work.
[01:59.900 --> 02:03.060]  Gavin's like, I'll stream it today. And we said, do you know what you're doing?
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.120]  And he said, I'll stream it today. And so six minutes ago, we went through stream settings.
[02:08.340 --> 02:12.020]  Dude, I got to the office maybe 20 minutes before Gavin did, and I was just like opening
[02:12.020 --> 02:16.060]  up the mail and putting stuff away. And Gavin, after he eventually figured out
[02:16.060 --> 02:19.720]  how to open the front door, which was hilarious. Jesus Christ, dude.
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.700]  He busted in, he took one look at me and he said, how do you stream?
[02:25.660 --> 02:29.720]  And I was like, how the fuck do I know? All right. And then he did it.
[02:29.940 --> 02:33.900]  In Gavin's defense, he sat down and he figured it out in about 90 seconds.
[02:34.120 --> 02:36.480]  I'm really, really proud of Gavin for getting this all together.
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.940]  And this is really cool. I'm really excited. I'm excited to watch Gavin beat this whole
[02:42.940 --> 02:46.640]  thing without even trying, honestly. But I'm also excited because tonight,
[02:46.640 --> 02:49.300]  the three of us will be participating in a Falcon event.
[02:50.960 --> 02:58.720]  We've had Tony Braxamon and all my morgues. We've got a Geoff issue.
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.540]  Seems like they can hear me echo in your microphone, Gavin.
[03:01.680 --> 03:05.520]  You are quite close to my mic, aren't you? So I'm going to hide over here and talk
[03:05.520 --> 03:07.920]  to a quiet like for the rest of the stream. Jesus Christ.
[03:08.420 --> 03:13.660]  So anyway, we have a Falcon event today at 8 p.m. central time.
[03:13.660 --> 03:16.660]  If you are a Falcon on patreon.com slash the regulation pod,
[03:16.700 --> 03:21.260]  you can join us and build the ultimate. Oh, Gavin, Gavin.
[03:21.620 --> 03:23.320]  Well, there's one. Nope.
[03:25.260 --> 03:30.540]  Got to restart the whole thing, buddy. Man. Wow.
[03:36.940 --> 03:39.420]  Did you did you die all the way? Like, did you turn it off?
[03:39.620 --> 03:42.280]  One, two, three. One, two, three. Did you not hit record?
[03:42.280 --> 03:45.720]  What did you do? Did you not hit record?
[03:47.500 --> 03:49.700]  Hey, Gavin. Thank you.
[03:50.840 --> 03:54.780]  I guess I'll put a little note on this audio file.
[03:56.320 --> 03:58.580]  He had a lot going on. He had a lot going on.
[04:00.220 --> 04:01.760]  It's very stressful. You weren't here.
[04:02.300 --> 04:04.960]  It's stressful to wake it up as a little sleepy boy in the forest.
[04:07.320 --> 04:10.020]  So did you restart the whole thing or was that one death?
[04:10.800 --> 04:13.300]  No, that's a restart. I just restarted the whole thing because
[04:14.020 --> 04:17.040]  I don't think I ever died that early. No, that was brutal.
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.680]  Yeah. Do you guys have any idea why five deaths,
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.660]  like why the developers decided that was the number?
[04:24.440 --> 04:27.280]  I mean, it's forgiving, but you do have to memorize the whole game.
[04:27.580 --> 04:32.140]  It allows for some mistakes. Yeah, I mean, like.
[04:34.360 --> 04:36.420]  I don't. Could have been four, could have been nine,
[04:36.540 --> 04:39.300]  could have been like a cat, could have been six, could have been three deaths.
[04:39.300 --> 04:42.360]  Nine would have been good. Cat style. I like that.
[04:43.720 --> 04:45.680]  Yeah. I don't know anything about this game,
[04:45.780 --> 04:48.120]  though, like kind of still. And I've watched it a couple of times.
[04:48.300 --> 04:50.860]  Like, I still don't really understand it or know anything about it or whatever.
[04:51.180 --> 04:54.860]  But five just seems like a thing where they went, that's a convenient number. This is fine.
[04:55.500 --> 04:59.420]  Or like the developer, like internally, there was a contest and five.
[05:00.100 --> 05:03.900]  Something like that, you know, I think like the number is always born of something.
[05:04.100 --> 05:05.400]  Yeah. I think you, uh,
[05:06.180 --> 05:09.500]  Javay. Yeah, Javay just gifted five and then five more.
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.440]  And then Johann Bach. There's so many gifted subs and everything.
[05:13.640 --> 05:17.040]  There's so many gifted subs. This is crazy. I appreciate you guys.
[05:17.340 --> 05:19.960]  It is true. Anybody can do it, but you don't have to, but you can.
[05:20.120 --> 05:24.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And because you can watch this on Tuesday in some kind of recorded format.
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.100]  Maybe if Gavin decides to hit record. Yeah, yeah.
[05:29.540 --> 05:33.520]  We've been having some, we've been having some technical difficulties this week in general.
[05:33.520 --> 05:36.660]  We lost, we lost it. We very rarely do we lose a full video.
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.760]  Yeah, that, I can't believe that happened to you guys.
[05:39.740 --> 05:42.640]  It's very rarely am I the only one without fucked up footage.
[05:45.060 --> 05:49.460]  Yeah, I mean, we're just been, we're trying to use the office recording set up more and it's,
[05:49.540 --> 05:51.260]  you know, we're just, uh, patching up some of the holes.
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.460]  Yeah. Gavin blamed Nick a lot for the, uh, dropped audio problem.
[05:55.560 --> 05:57.220]  Then it was not a problem at all.
[05:57.940 --> 06:01.520]  Yeah, it was, uh, it was not Nick's fault, but as he was not there,
[06:01.520 --> 06:03.540]  I decided that would be an easy blame throw.
[06:03.760 --> 06:06.040]  Yeah. Eric, why don't you go ahead and say thanks to that person?
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.740]  Oh, Sib? Are you talking about Sib?
[06:08.080 --> 06:08.900]  Yeah, Sib, there you go.
[06:08.920 --> 06:12.980]  Yeah. Oh, dude, me and Sib, we're tight. We're thick as thieves, me and the homie,
[06:13.420 --> 06:17.180]  me and Sib. And also Malignant Slutrot.
[06:17.620 --> 06:19.580]  Dude, Malignant Slutrot's good people.
[06:19.960 --> 06:23.560]  And Scott Steiner's Shonies. Scott Steiner's Shonies with two gifted subs.
[06:25.380 --> 06:26.820]  When was the last time you went to a Shonies?
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.520]  Dude, I've never been to a Shonies.
[06:28.860 --> 06:29.320]  Oh, really?
[06:29.460 --> 06:31.500]  Never. It's like a southern thing, right?
[06:31.500 --> 06:33.720]  Yeah, they were all over the south when I was growing up.
[06:33.780 --> 06:35.560]  It's like a Florida thing. Gavin, that's...
[06:35.560 --> 06:36.120]  Oh, there's bees?
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.700]  Gavin, Gavin, no, he's about to step on that trap.
[06:39.360 --> 06:39.760]  That...
[06:39.760 --> 06:40.220]  Yeah.
[06:40.440 --> 06:43.780]  I think it's like pixel-wise, I couldn't have been closer.
[06:43.800 --> 06:47.300]  Yeah, I don't know that you could have been closer. It's pretty cool.
[06:49.120 --> 06:49.860]  Oh, goodness.
[06:51.720 --> 06:52.520]  Goodness gracious.
[06:52.900 --> 06:53.040]  Yeah.
[06:55.640 --> 06:56.040]  Man.
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.540]  Oh, hey, Gavin, did you see Fantastic Four?
[07:00.500 --> 07:00.860]  Yeah.
[07:02.460 --> 07:04.780]  Uh, you want to give an in-depth review or a quick review?
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.080]  I'll go for quick.
[07:08.280 --> 07:08.640]  Okay.
[07:10.240 --> 07:13.420]  I'm, like, do you have any, uh, like, if you had to ask a question about it,
[07:14.740 --> 07:15.860]  what would you ask?
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.340]  Oh, did you like Fantastic Four?
[07:17.880 --> 07:18.140]  No.
[07:19.640 --> 07:21.000]  Salty stick, thank you very much.
[07:21.980 --> 07:23.420]  Eric, did you see Fantastic Four?
[07:23.620 --> 07:24.360]  No, no.
[07:24.540 --> 07:24.860]  Oh, okay.
[07:24.860 --> 07:27.560]  We talked about Winchester Ghosts, thank you for the 10 subs.
[07:27.740 --> 07:29.340]  We talked about it, I think, yesterday,
[07:29.340 --> 07:32.280]  where the first trailer Fantastic Four made me go,
[07:32.420 --> 07:33.460]  holy shit, I want to see this movie.
[07:33.600 --> 07:35.300]  And then every subsequent trailer made me go,
[07:35.400 --> 07:37.100]  I want to see this movie so much less.
[07:37.680 --> 07:38.400]  Every trailer.
[07:38.980 --> 07:40.960]  Was it mediocre or bad?
[07:41.720 --> 07:44.060]  I just, I just should have watched it on a plane.
[07:44.680 --> 07:45.860]  Oh, that's good.
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.660]  I mean, that's fair.
[07:47.020 --> 07:47.560]  That's fair.
[07:48.940 --> 07:49.160]  Yeah.
[07:49.860 --> 07:51.440]  Because that would have been great to, you know,
[07:51.440 --> 07:53.180]  fall asleep, sort of, at the beginning of Act Two.
[07:53.180 --> 07:55.160]  Kind of phase in and out of, yeah.
[07:55.740 --> 07:56.000]  Yeah.
[07:56.240 --> 07:57.520]  Don't you pull this one up and go left?
[07:57.520 --> 07:58.620]  Bad Reed Richards.
[07:58.780 --> 07:59.040]  Oof.
[08:02.260 --> 08:03.280]  Pedro Pascal was bad?
[08:04.340 --> 08:05.420]  That's what somebody said.
[08:05.660 --> 08:05.980]  Wow.
[08:06.220 --> 08:07.280]  One person in a Twitch chat?
[08:07.380 --> 08:07.820]  That's crazy.
[08:08.220 --> 08:09.560]  Well, somebody else said Pedro was fine.
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.520]  Oh, that's interesting.
[08:10.680 --> 08:11.360]  Well, you know what?
[08:11.380 --> 08:12.300]  We're kind of getting both sides.
[08:13.620 --> 08:14.780]  That's what we're all about here.
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.060]  Oh, Eric, I meant to tell you,
[08:18.160 --> 08:19.980]  do you know what I discovered when I was in Gress Point?
[08:20.160 --> 08:20.480]  What's that?
[08:21.100 --> 08:23.760]  They have a, maybe the world's largest,
[08:23.840 --> 08:25.680]  or one of the world's largest Snoopy museums.
[08:26.060 --> 08:26.460]  What?
[08:27.000 --> 08:27.400]  Yeah.
[08:27.580 --> 08:27.820]  Really?
[08:28.340 --> 08:29.360]  Yeah, I didn't go to it,
[08:29.460 --> 08:32.180]  but if we ever make it up that way, I'll take you.
[08:33.960 --> 08:35.380]  It's a Snoopy museum?
[08:35.820 --> 08:36.940]  Yeah, Snoopy-themed museum.
[08:37.340 --> 08:37.480]  Yeah.
[08:38.740 --> 08:39.100]  What?
[08:39.540 --> 08:41.860]  I found out about it, like, the night before we left,
[08:41.940 --> 08:42.760]  so we couldn't check it out.
[08:44.600 --> 08:46.880]  Is it just like a guy's collection, or...?
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.720]  I think it's like a personal collection that somebody has turned into a public collection.
[08:50.960 --> 08:52.140]  It's like, holy shit.
[08:52.700 --> 08:54.080]  But I think it's big.
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.100]  It might be in St. Clair Shores, not Gress Point.
[08:56.100 --> 08:58.060]  18,000 Snoopy items.
[08:58.420 --> 08:58.820]  Yeah.
[08:59.420 --> 09:01.340]  Wow, that's cool. I like that he focused on Snoopy,
[09:01.440 --> 09:03.000]  and not any of those stupid fucking kids.
[09:04.000 --> 09:06.860]  Thanks for the subs, A-Pan-Pan-Pan-Pan-Pan.
[09:06.960 --> 09:09.860]  There are also a load of subs from Grunk-Funkle.
[09:10.040 --> 09:10.860]  I don't know if you read those out.
[09:11.840 --> 09:15.440]  Grunk-Funkle and A-Pan-A-Pan-Stale-Nine are both given subs?
[09:15.580 --> 09:17.520]  Dude, we gotta go back.
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.180]  Grunk-Funkle is a tremendous name, and I feel like...
[09:21.800 --> 09:22.860]  easily could be a worm.
[09:23.660 --> 09:25.340]  Dude, I think A-Pan-A-Pan-Stale-Nine
[09:25.340 --> 09:28.900]  is going to be a forever thing for us, for that stupid game.
[09:29.300 --> 09:31.780]  That stupid full-spectrum warrior, or whatever.
[09:33.480 --> 09:34.900]  Is that what that's from?
[09:35.220 --> 09:38.580]  Yeah, it was one of, like, the cheat codes, or whatever.
[09:39.220 --> 09:42.720]  It, like, didn't work. It was so stupid.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.660]  The fickle tickle pickle, thank you very much.
[09:45.680 --> 09:46.440]  Oh, man.
[09:47.260 --> 09:48.680]  Uh-oh. Spiber.
[09:49.700 --> 09:52.140]  What, you're already at the spider, dude? You're flying right now.
[09:53.680 --> 09:54.840]  Flying with my little legs.
[09:55.340 --> 09:57.540]  What do you gotta do here with the spider, big guy?
[09:57.940 --> 10:00.660]  I wait for the spider to knock the trap down out of the tree.
[10:01.880 --> 10:03.800]  Are you gonna, like, stab or what?
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.300]  No. Here we go.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.160]  Nice.
[10:07.420 --> 10:09.460]  And then it goes clank. Oh, it's not down yet.
[10:12.770 --> 10:13.990]  He has to do it two or three times.
[10:15.630 --> 10:19.670]  Oh, nice.
[10:22.650 --> 10:23.990]  I hate jumping over the fence.
[10:23.990 --> 10:25.150]  That was crazy.
[10:26.130 --> 10:27.010]  What was crazy about it?
[10:27.010 --> 10:29.270]  That was just, like, a movement. He just went for it.
[10:29.610 --> 10:31.990]  Ballsy, man. Yeah, he did. Tough as nails, this guy.
[10:31.990 --> 10:33.150]  Yeah, no kidding. I'm proud of you.
[10:33.250 --> 10:35.330]  What's, what's your name? Is your name Limbo?
[10:35.930 --> 10:36.250]  Yeah.
[10:36.550 --> 10:37.090]  Ben Limbo.
[10:37.790 --> 10:38.430]  I'm a little Limbo.
[10:39.750 --> 10:41.250]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[10:43.410 --> 10:44.430]  God, have you ever...
[10:44.430 --> 10:45.070]  Stupid little guy.
[10:45.070 --> 10:45.670]  He's dead again, huh?
[10:45.850 --> 10:46.990]  Have you ever reset a bear trap?
[10:48.370 --> 10:49.350]  Yeah, they're hard to do.
[10:49.570 --> 10:50.350]  Some scary shit.
[10:50.650 --> 10:51.870]  I've never set a bear trap.
[10:51.990 --> 10:52.870]  Oh, you idiot!
[10:53.510 --> 10:53.830]  God!
[10:53.830 --> 10:54.210]  God!
[10:57.170 --> 10:57.890]  You fool!
[10:58.510 --> 10:59.990]  That was gruesome.
[11:00.070 --> 11:01.350]  Yeah, that's what happens in this game.
[11:01.670 --> 11:02.190]  It's pretty brutal.
[11:02.850 --> 11:05.790]  Somebody said we should do a Bird Not Bird draft. That's actually a great idea.
[11:06.850 --> 11:07.810]  I'll put it on the list.
[11:07.990 --> 11:08.790]  Bird Not Bird?
[11:08.950 --> 11:09.930]  Yeah, I'm gonna put it on the list.
[11:11.310 --> 11:12.330]  Like Larry Bird?
[11:12.550 --> 11:12.810]  Yeah.
[11:13.510 --> 11:14.670]  Bird's Biscuits in Austin?
[11:15.750 --> 11:16.830]  How do you feel about that place?
[11:17.590 --> 11:18.170]  I love it.
[11:18.530 --> 11:19.070]  Bird Bird Biscuit?
[11:19.210 --> 11:21.670]  I wish there were more of them, and I didn't, like...
[11:21.670 --> 11:23.370]  I know you're supposed to, like, order online or whatever,
[11:23.370 --> 11:25.610]  but I never think about it until I'm driving by one.
[11:26.330 --> 11:29.370]  The one over in Cherrywood is always way too busy,
[11:29.550 --> 11:33.510]  but I find the one up on Burnet to be much easier to get out of.
[11:33.590 --> 11:35.430]  It's just pretty far away from where I live now.
[11:35.450 --> 11:36.710]  Yeah, it's pretty far.
[11:37.290 --> 11:38.630]  But that's the one I used to always go to.
[11:38.810 --> 11:38.950]  Yeah.
[11:38.970 --> 11:39.970]  I live a little further north.
[11:45.770 --> 11:47.750]  Dude, Bird Not Bird draft is a really good idea.
[11:47.890 --> 11:48.410]  Oh, God.
[11:48.990 --> 11:49.410]  Yeah, it is.
[11:49.770 --> 11:53.010]  Also, another good reason to support Bird Bird Biscuit, black-owned business in Austin.
[11:53.310 --> 11:54.290]  Is that right? I didn't know that.
[11:54.710 --> 11:54.890]  Yeah.
[11:55.690 --> 11:59.790]  And putting Bird Not Bird... Bird Not Bird draft.
[12:00.650 --> 12:01.520]  All right, uh...
[12:02.290 --> 12:03.850]  Chat, if you can keep count for me.
[12:04.130 --> 12:04.230]  One.
[12:04.370 --> 12:06.570]  Obviously, that was one, but just let's keep count, so, uh...
[12:06.570 --> 12:07.650]  Elbow deep, daddy.
[12:09.130 --> 12:10.190]  Thank you for that.
[12:21.380 --> 12:24.820]  CarRed99, thank you for breaking up the freak name hype train.
[12:25.020 --> 12:25.560]  Appreciate you.
[12:25.620 --> 12:26.160]  Thanks, SeventhRider.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.320]  Six months of nonsensical brilliance. I love you.
[12:29.440 --> 12:29.700]  Yeah.
[12:29.700 --> 12:30.260]  That's awesome.
[12:34.630 --> 12:36.170]  Okay, gotta get webbed up.
[12:37.810 --> 12:39.990]  Dude, I don't know what's going on like the last couple days.
[12:40.130 --> 12:43.130]  I'm just burning through this deodorant and it is like...
[12:43.130 --> 12:43.950]  It's brutal.
[12:44.150 --> 12:45.550]  It's just brutal to be around.
[12:45.690 --> 12:45.850]  Yeah.
[12:46.110 --> 12:47.170]  Is it different deodorant?
[12:47.390 --> 12:48.030]  No, no.
[12:48.090 --> 12:49.150]  It's the stuff I usually use.
[12:49.250 --> 12:51.510]  I just... I think I've just been way more like just doing stuff.
[12:51.690 --> 12:52.250]  And so I'm just...
[12:52.250 --> 12:52.590]  Way more active?
[12:52.810 --> 12:54.070]  Yeah, just like cooking through it.
[12:54.090 --> 12:56.450]  And then all of a sudden it's like, I put it on later again, more.
[12:56.990 --> 12:59.410]  It's also been pretty humid this week.
[12:59.470 --> 13:00.850]  Yeah, I think maybe that's what it is.
[13:00.930 --> 13:01.770]  That's probably part of it.
[13:02.070 --> 13:02.130]  Yeah.
[13:02.430 --> 13:06.650]  Oh, speaking of Austin, I went to our new sandwich spot for lunch today.
[13:07.010 --> 13:07.450]  Mailbox.
[13:07.450 --> 13:08.190]  Wanted to make Gavin sick.
[13:09.070 --> 13:09.950]  Mailbox ejaculator.
[13:11.410 --> 13:12.070]  Evil rain.
[13:12.290 --> 13:12.530]  Oiled Eric.
[13:12.730 --> 13:13.350]  Oiled Eric.
[13:14.610 --> 13:15.450]  Evil rain.
[13:15.770 --> 13:17.970]  Wait, Pikachu used to work.
[13:18.110 --> 13:19.210]  What the fuck?
[13:19.850 --> 13:20.290]  Anyway.
[13:20.850 --> 13:21.610]  You went and got a sandwich?
[13:21.610 --> 13:24.410]  I went to Hansom's today and...
[13:25.110 --> 13:26.690]  Because Emily had wanted to go.
[13:27.510 --> 13:30.130]  Because we tried to go initially the first time and it was closed.
[13:30.350 --> 13:31.030]  And then I went with you.
[13:31.110 --> 13:34.050]  So anyway, I took her and they had a sandwich of the month as the club.
[13:34.150 --> 13:35.530]  And it was a pressed club.
[13:36.110 --> 13:36.910]  Holy shit.
[13:37.270 --> 13:38.550]  Stop the presses, dude.
[13:38.830 --> 13:39.330]  No, no.
[13:39.330 --> 13:39.850]  Start the presses.
[13:40.770 --> 13:41.250]  It was...
[13:41.250 --> 13:42.370]  Start the panini presses.
[13:42.570 --> 13:43.950]  It was so fucking good.
[13:45.050 --> 13:46.530]  Was there anything crazy on the club?
[13:46.610 --> 13:47.430]  Or was it pretty straightforward?
[13:48.030 --> 13:48.610]  It was pretty straightforward.
[13:48.830 --> 13:50.010]  I got it without mayonnaise, obviously.
[13:50.150 --> 13:50.310]  Yeah.
[13:50.570 --> 13:51.010]  Yeah, turkey.
[13:52.170 --> 13:52.910]  Seriously good.
[13:53.150 --> 13:55.330]  A pressed club is a great...
[13:55.330 --> 13:56.450]  Oh, beautiful.
[13:56.650 --> 13:56.990]  That was perfect.
[13:57.090 --> 13:57.250]  Nice.
[13:57.330 --> 13:58.010]  Good move, bud.
[14:04.180 --> 14:04.660]  Vespasian79AD.
[14:04.800 --> 14:05.120]  Thank you.
[14:05.560 --> 14:06.040]  Thank you.
[14:06.440 --> 14:07.020]  Thank you.
[14:07.680 --> 14:08.960]  Good job, dance friend.
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.180]  Really caught on.
[14:11.420 --> 14:11.720]  Okay.
[14:13.580 --> 14:18.120]  Oh, did I tell you about the Ukrainian apartment hawk that I started following?
[14:18.420 --> 14:20.400]  Or apartment falcon that I started following on TikTok?
[14:21.020 --> 14:21.420]  No.
[14:21.660 --> 14:22.280]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[14:22.860 --> 14:24.620]  People keep, like, this falcon is like a pet.
[14:24.760 --> 14:25.220]  It's pretty cool.
[14:27.280 --> 14:30.580]  It just lives in Ukraine and just sort of, like, hops around and stuff.
[14:31.020 --> 14:31.720]  Well, they feed it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.160]  Thanks, Persian Beets.
[14:33.200 --> 14:35.640]  Like, mice and things.
[14:36.480 --> 14:37.720]  It probably feeds itself, mostly.
[14:38.060 --> 14:40.300]  Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of, like, how it goes.
[14:40.380 --> 14:42.780]  But I think they still feed it, like, you know, here's a cold mouse.
[14:45.500 --> 14:46.160]  You gotta watch out.
[14:46.260 --> 14:46.480]  There's a...
[14:46.480 --> 14:48.340]  Gavin, I don't want to freak you out, but there's a spider behind you.
[14:48.420 --> 14:49.940]  I don't want to freak you out.
[14:51.140 --> 14:51.780]  I'm fine.
[14:51.780 --> 14:52.560]  I'll be all right.
[14:59.160 --> 15:00.620]  Whoa, way to go.
[15:00.960 --> 15:02.280]  Is there fall damage in this game?
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.140]  No.
[15:03.300 --> 15:05.100]  Can you die if you fall from afar enough?
[15:05.280 --> 15:07.020]  Yeah, that's what happened when I restarted.
[15:07.020 --> 15:08.220]  Yeah, that's why he restarted the whole thing.
[15:08.280 --> 15:09.080]  That's why he's only at one.
[15:11.380 --> 15:13.220]  Oh, is this the thing that makes you, like, just keep running?
[15:15.720 --> 15:16.840]  Oh, the little...
[15:16.840 --> 15:17.180]  Yeah.
[15:17.260 --> 15:18.320]  The brain thing, yeah.
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.920]  Okay, so I grab this and then I swing back.
[15:22.220 --> 15:22.540]  Is that right?
[15:23.700 --> 15:24.680]  Yes, yeah.
[15:25.360 --> 15:26.000]  Thanks, Chimera.
[15:26.520 --> 15:27.120]  There you go.
[15:27.780 --> 15:28.120]  Good work.
[15:31.700 --> 15:32.140]  Okay.
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.420]  I think I've died there before, so that's good.
[15:35.640 --> 15:36.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:36.180 --> 15:36.740]  You're learning.
[15:37.060 --> 15:38.580]  You're downloading this shit, dude.
[15:39.860 --> 15:40.760]  But then there's the bit...
[15:40.760 --> 15:41.000]  Death earned.
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.360]  There's the bit with the double swinging bear traps that I don't remember at any time.
[15:45.380 --> 15:45.820]  Cedar High, Warden.
[15:48.340 --> 15:48.780]  Okay.
[15:49.640 --> 15:53.280]  Does anyone else miss the next on... the next time on Bijack?
[15:53.500 --> 15:54.720]  I know Nick doesn't miss...
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.820]  Nick's trying to run it down every week.
[15:55.820 --> 15:57.320]  I don't fucking miss it at all.
[15:57.920 --> 15:59.740]  Please, Jack, turn it in.
[16:00.140 --> 16:01.160]  But we can't put the episode out.
[16:03.020 --> 16:05.300]  It was a very... it was a very difficult part of...
[16:05.300 --> 16:07.940]  Yeah, that's what I want for this show, is more points of failure, man.
[16:08.260 --> 16:10.200]  Yeah, we just... we gotta eliminate points of failure.
[16:10.520 --> 16:10.700]  Yep.
[16:11.280 --> 16:11.900]  Oh my god!
[16:12.220 --> 16:13.460]  Oh my god.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.260]  What a move.
[16:16.140 --> 16:17.660]  This is MLG Pro.
[16:19.060 --> 16:19.480]  Damn.
[16:21.680 --> 16:22.240]  Uh-oh!
[16:23.240 --> 16:25.120]  Wow, you did download this, dude.
[16:25.140 --> 16:26.160]  You know this stuff.
[16:26.160 --> 16:28.100]  Shitus and Kane, five subs.
[16:30.940 --> 16:32.420]  That was dangerous.
[16:33.280 --> 16:36.000]  Shitus and Kane almost laughed me into that spike bit there.
[16:38.820 --> 16:39.720]  Holy shit.
[16:44.080 --> 16:45.380]  Oh my god.
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.080]  I can just, in the corner of my eye, see Geoff leaning away so he doesn't laugh too much into my mic.
[16:50.540 --> 16:51.120]  That's great.
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.540]  Oh, that's right.
[16:57.600 --> 16:58.500]  It's... I remember this.
[17:01.300 --> 17:02.860]  Do I remember what this does?
[17:03.800 --> 17:04.640]  Just go under it.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.620]  Yeah, you just have to wait.
[17:06.760 --> 17:07.080]  Yeah.
[17:07.420 --> 17:08.060]  Thanks, Candles.
[17:08.260 --> 17:08.620]  Thanks, love.
[17:09.760 --> 17:10.520]  Get out of here, you rat.
[17:10.540 --> 17:12.940]  I always skipped it because why waste time spilling the next episode?
[17:12.960 --> 17:14.180]  Spummer of 98!
[17:14.840 --> 17:15.400]  It's Spummer.
[17:15.520 --> 17:16.420]  It's a Spummer summer.
[17:19.300 --> 17:21.900]  Who in the chat is gonna hang out with us tonight on the Falcon event?
[17:22.220 --> 17:22.540]  Oh, yeah.
[17:22.560 --> 17:24.060]  Gonna be me, Eric, and Gavin, I guess.
[17:24.200 --> 17:24.360]  Yep.
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.040]  We're gonna build the ultimate Summer music playlist, I think?
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.280]  Yeah, I think that's what we can do.
[17:30.380 --> 17:36.140]  I think, uh, uh, HubbyNestor, thank you for the sub, uh, the, I think we have a couple
[17:36.140 --> 17:38.900]  different ideas about how to do it, but I think what we landed on where it was like,
[17:38.980 --> 17:44.660]  we'll put a couple songs in, and then maybe some people, like the Falcons, can like, kick
[17:44.660 --> 17:50.680]  some suggestions out, we'll listen to a couple maybe, and then, uh, you know, vote on it,
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.320]  see if it makes the list.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.800]  I'll throw it all on a Spotify list.
[17:52.900 --> 17:53.060]  Yeah.
[17:53.200 --> 17:53.340]  Yeah.
[17:54.180 --> 17:54.540]  Yep.
[17:58.240 --> 17:59.560]  How much is a Falcon membership?
[17:59.740 --> 18:02.820]  Well, you can go to patreon.com slash regulation pod to find that out for yourself.
[18:03.240 --> 18:05.800]  And then that's taken away one barrier of entry.
[18:06.120 --> 18:06.820]  Isn't that incredible?
[18:07.860 --> 18:12.320]  We've got, uh, bog standard, we've got extra medium, and we've got, uh, we've got the
[18:12.320 --> 18:13.380]  protected by Falcons tier.
[18:13.580 --> 18:13.740]  Yep.
[18:14.600 --> 18:14.960]  Yeah.
[18:15.100 --> 18:18.560]  There is also the last great tier, but that is, that, you don't have, that's a,
[18:18.880 --> 18:19.300]  We don't recommend that.
[18:19.340 --> 18:21.480]  Yeah, we don't recommend, we, we, we recommend Falcon.
[18:22.660 --> 18:23.200]  I'm just letting you know.
[18:23.200 --> 18:26.000]  Can anyone remember what I do here?
[18:26.220 --> 18:26.500]  Zero.
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.460]  Oh, oh wait, don't you have to like, don't you have to like go right and then go left
[18:30.460 --> 18:30.900]  or something?
[18:31.480 --> 18:33.840]  Yeah, I go, I think I go right under the one that swings left.
[18:34.020 --> 18:37.120]  Yeah, and then you gotta go, but then you have to like immediately like go the other
[18:37.120 --> 18:37.680]  way, don't you?
[18:38.360 --> 18:38.680]  Yeah.
[18:38.940 --> 18:39.120]  Yeah.
[18:39.240 --> 18:39.960]  Oh God.
[18:40.180 --> 18:43.920]  I have an answer for you, rare exotic pigeon, who says, getting a new house, how do I convince
[18:43.920 --> 18:46.100]  my wife to let me shave outside with a broken mirror?
[18:46.220 --> 18:47.260]  Just start doing it, man.
[18:47.260 --> 18:50.060]  You don't, this is, this is, uh, this is marriage, man.
[18:50.080 --> 18:52.440]  You don't ask for permission, you ask for forgiveness.
[18:52.600 --> 18:52.780]  Yeah.
[18:53.220 --> 18:53.580]  Yeah.
[18:53.700 --> 18:54.880]  Just apologize later.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.500]  Yeah, and she may never forgive you, just so you're aware.
[18:57.680 --> 18:59.100]  That doesn't mean that like you're absolved.
[18:59.120 --> 19:00.160]  You can't ask for it.
[19:00.340 --> 19:03.820]  Or just have a wife that approves of alternate shaving behavior.
[19:05.580 --> 19:08.960]  Yeah, yeah, have her get fucking sick of it being in the sink all the time.
[19:09.420 --> 19:09.960]  Oh no!
[19:10.520 --> 19:12.200]  It was the other order, it was the other way.
[19:12.760 --> 19:13.780]  That guy, he good.
[19:14.560 --> 19:15.100]  That's two.
[19:15.180 --> 19:16.580]  Okay, wait, wait, so what happened there?
[19:16.800 --> 19:21.800]  I think you have to like start it so it goes a little bit and then run back really fast,
[19:21.820 --> 19:22.040]  don't you?
[19:22.460 --> 19:25.120]  So I run right, left, thank you chat, two.
[19:25.800 --> 19:27.180]  Wait, oh no!
[19:28.060 --> 19:29.280]  I'm gonna mess up again.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.340]  Having a wife rocks.
[19:32.400 --> 19:34.240]  Mark the frog, having a wife rocks.
[19:34.420 --> 19:34.760]  You're right.
[19:34.880 --> 19:35.280]  He's right.
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.360]  There you go.
[19:37.480 --> 19:38.560]  And left, left, oh, oh, oh!
[19:38.640 --> 19:39.780]  There you go, you got it.
[19:39.820 --> 19:40.260]  There you go.
[19:40.680 --> 19:41.120]  There you go, man.
[19:41.200 --> 19:41.360]  Okay.
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.200]  I always waste one there.
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.320]  You did it, yeah, that's tough.
[19:44.360 --> 19:44.780]  What a schmuck.
[19:45.100 --> 19:45.260]  Yep.
[19:45.600 --> 19:46.680]  What are we at, two deaths now?
[19:46.780 --> 19:49.200]  Yep, reliant B with the subs, thank you so much.
[19:49.500 --> 19:50.060]  Thank you so much.
[19:50.060 --> 19:52.960]  But you're probably like 60% of the way through the game at this point.
[19:53.240 --> 19:56.120]  Yeah, he's gotta be 60 to 80%, I think, I think.
[19:56.500 --> 19:58.860]  Like, you gotta be coming up on the final boss, I think.
[20:04.020 --> 20:06.860]  Just celebrated five years of marriage, having a wife does indeed rock.
[20:06.920 --> 20:08.240]  Congratulations on making it five years.
[20:09.180 --> 20:10.360]  May you make it five more.
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.720]  And then, and then, and then the end.
[20:13.760 --> 20:14.100]  And then we'll see.
[20:15.480 --> 20:16.520]  We'll just take it from there.
[20:18.500 --> 20:20.640]  It's better not to project out more than five years anyway.
[20:21.460 --> 20:21.800]  No.
[20:22.440 --> 20:24.820]  Yeah, don't, don't you, he has to like stand on it or something?
[20:24.980 --> 20:25.320]  What happened?
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.500]  Where do I stand?
[20:26.580 --> 20:28.400]  Do I stand on the far end?
[20:28.600 --> 20:29.260]  I think so.
[20:29.640 --> 20:31.160]  And he like boings you up?
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.060]  He like whammos it?
[20:33.300 --> 20:33.440]  Yeah.
[20:34.320 --> 20:34.960]  Gduff5gifted, thank you.
[20:35.580 --> 20:36.980]  Oh my god, thank you so much, Gduff.
[20:37.320 --> 20:39.320]  Oh my god, oh my god, thank you so much, Gduff.
[20:39.340 --> 20:39.940]  Oh my god.
[20:40.100 --> 20:40.940]  Thank you oh so much.
[20:41.480 --> 20:42.620]  There you go, there you go, there you go.
[20:43.200 --> 20:43.480]  Okay.
[20:44.520 --> 20:45.420]  Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
[20:45.460 --> 20:48.160]  The spider from Limbo in chat says don't overthink it.
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.160]  That was the best.
[20:59.160 --> 21:01.080]  Don't you just like jump on it or something and then like go hide?
[21:01.840 --> 21:02.200]  Yeah.
[21:03.140 --> 21:04.060]  Go and hide.
[21:04.380 --> 21:04.800]  Go hide.
[21:05.380 --> 21:05.580]  Hide!
[21:07.080 --> 21:07.560]  Hiya!
[21:07.840 --> 21:09.220]  That's you, spider from Limbo.
[21:10.100 --> 21:11.320]  Wow, nice knowing you.
[21:12.940 --> 21:14.100]  Trey Wrangler, thank you.
[21:15.740 --> 21:16.020]  Okay.
[21:20.790 --> 21:22.050]  Just lost a sub.
[21:26.070 --> 21:28.590]  A beardy weirdy sub, thank you very much.
[21:28.730 --> 21:30.010]  You didn't have to do that, but you did.
[21:30.210 --> 21:31.170]  And we appreciate it.
[21:32.950 --> 21:35.330]  Enjoying this Friday stream from my new house in Cumbria.
[21:35.550 --> 21:36.270]  What the fuck?
[21:36.390 --> 21:37.350]  They named a city that?
[21:37.830 --> 21:38.090]  Oh wow, congrats.
[21:40.370 --> 21:42.730]  Do you guys, Gavin says that like he knows where Cumbria is.
[21:43.250 --> 21:43.610]  Cumbria?
[21:43.870 --> 21:44.390]  Yeah, where is it?
[21:45.130 --> 21:45.710]  It's up there.
[21:45.850 --> 21:48.730]  It flooded, uh, what, a couple of decades ago?
[21:48.990 --> 21:49.670]  It was in the news a lot.
[21:49.950 --> 21:50.150]  England?
[21:50.690 --> 21:50.870]  Yeah.
[21:51.110 --> 21:51.690]  Okay, thank you.
[21:52.070 --> 21:52.930]  They named it that?
[21:54.930 --> 21:56.290]  Maybe it wasn't that long ago.
[21:56.330 --> 21:57.090]  They named it Cumbria?
[21:57.090 --> 21:57.610]  Mass flooding.
[21:57.710 --> 21:58.330]  What the fuck?
[21:59.810 --> 22:01.210]  Don't you like grab his arm or something?
[22:01.450 --> 22:03.330]  Yeah, pull it off, beat him with it.
[22:06.110 --> 22:07.630]  Oh, I only half pulled it off.
[22:07.710 --> 22:08.710]  Oh my god!
[22:09.150 --> 22:10.110]  Let me get it the rest of the way.
[22:10.230 --> 22:10.870]  Oh, it's suffering.
[22:11.710 --> 22:12.250]  Oh god.
[22:12.470 --> 22:14.030]  I mean, that's fine probably for this thing.
[22:14.630 --> 22:15.030]  There we go.
[22:17.810 --> 22:18.470]  Yeah, take that.
[22:18.490 --> 22:19.850]  It was just trying to feed its family.
[22:20.930 --> 22:21.970]  Yeah, it should have found something else to eat.
[22:21.970 --> 22:23.710]  The spider's gonna be like, mommy, where's daddy?
[22:24.130 --> 22:25.390]  Why didn't daddy come home tonight?
[22:25.790 --> 22:26.230]  It's gone.
[22:26.390 --> 22:29.130]  The spider's got the curtain open looking, going, I don't know, sweetie.
[22:29.230 --> 22:30.250]  He must have had to work late.
[22:30.770 --> 22:31.370]  He'll be home.
[22:37.900 --> 22:39.140]  Disappointed wife, five subs.
[22:40.980 --> 22:42.380]  I've had a few of those in my day.
[22:45.980 --> 22:49.860]  It looks like either a silhouetted scrotum or lemon.
[22:50.040 --> 22:50.640]  Yeah, really?
[22:51.420 --> 22:52.560]  Akira, 101.
[22:52.720 --> 22:53.480]  Pretty hairy lemon.
[22:53.680 --> 22:53.940]  10.
[22:54.240 --> 22:54.640]  Gifted.
[22:54.920 --> 22:55.160]  Hell.
[22:55.360 --> 22:55.580]  Yeah.
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.080]  Wow.
[22:57.880 --> 22:59.060]  Crazy amount of subs today.
[22:59.280 --> 23:00.160]  Yeah, man, the rats are out.
[23:04.980 --> 23:06.140]  I don't trust that bird.
[23:08.840 --> 23:13.200]  I noticed when I was struggling to open the door, you didn't come up and just open the door.
[23:13.940 --> 23:14.400]  Well, no.
[23:14.740 --> 23:15.020]  Okay.
[23:15.600 --> 23:17.140]  No, it was funnier to watch.
[23:17.320 --> 23:18.000]  Yeah, I hear that.
[23:20.260 --> 23:23.800]  Like, it was pretty obvious quickly that it wasn't going well.
[23:23.800 --> 23:29.580]  Yeah, I want to see how it plays out.
[23:32.380 --> 23:34.620]  And you looked annoyed when the door opened.
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.840]  Wow, what a coincidence.
[23:40.200 --> 23:43.300]  I don't like it when I try the same thing twice and one of the times it works.
[23:43.500 --> 23:43.860]  I just can't.
[23:44.020 --> 23:45.480]  I'm just like, what did I do different?
[23:46.860 --> 23:50.100]  Is it like doing the USB where it's the wrong way, the wrong way, the right way?
[23:50.560 --> 23:50.780]  Yeah.
[23:54.140 --> 23:58.220]  And it won't go in the right way until you realize it's the Grubbs.
[23:59.060 --> 24:00.160]  Oh, it's Grubbs time.
[24:00.900 --> 24:01.480]  Grubbs time.
[24:05.950 --> 24:06.910]  Do you remember what you do here?
[24:07.870 --> 24:09.230]  I just jump on that body, do I?
[24:09.530 --> 24:10.510]  I don't know, do you?
[24:10.930 --> 24:14.550]  Ouroboros said, did Gavin study the game since the last time or is he going in raw?
[24:14.730 --> 24:17.750]  The words Gavin and study do not belong in the same sentence.
[24:20.590 --> 24:22.030]  He's asking, what do I do here?
[24:22.930 --> 24:26.470]  These, uh, these streams are the studying.
[24:26.750 --> 24:27.730]  Yeah, it's true.
[24:35.640 --> 24:37.020]  How are you feeling about this idea, Gav?
[24:38.640 --> 24:39.700]  This wheel that we're on?
[24:39.820 --> 24:40.020]  Yeah.
[24:40.840 --> 24:41.440]  Awful idea.
[24:43.380 --> 24:44.500]  Well, I should have stood my ground.
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.320]  I should have said, no, this is a future spin.
[24:46.460 --> 24:46.600]  Yeah.
[24:46.620 --> 24:47.660]  And let's build it out more.
[24:47.900 --> 24:48.440]  Yeah, you blew it.
[24:48.440 --> 24:49.280]  You didn't do that, though, did you?
[24:50.360 --> 24:51.440]  Oh my gosh, nice.
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.140]  Take this one.
[24:54.440 --> 24:55.040]  Yeah, there you go.
[24:56.200 --> 24:56.880]  Steal that one.
[24:57.640 --> 24:58.320]  What are you going to do?
[24:58.460 --> 24:59.640]  Are you going to ride it down or something?
[25:00.080 --> 25:02.160]  I'm just polishing the cliffside here.
[25:02.780 --> 25:04.700]  Making sure it's nice and slick.
[25:10.640 --> 25:12.360]  Geoff, what do you think Merc the Frog got up to today?
[25:13.620 --> 25:16.960]  Uh, I don't know, but I bet it was hot as shit that he was wearing.
[25:17.320 --> 25:17.540]  Yep.
[25:18.480 --> 25:21.220]  I forgot what kind of pants he said he wore this morning when we were streaming.
[25:21.420 --> 25:25.340]  He's wearing some vintage workwear pants or whatever that you can get from Costco for $17.
[25:25.960 --> 25:28.780]  Oh, that's, I got, dude, I've been doing Costco pants.
[25:28.920 --> 25:29.680]  They're so cheap.
[25:29.980 --> 25:30.640]  Oh my god.
[25:30.640 --> 25:33.060]  I've been wearing Costco pants for about a year now.
[25:33.280 --> 25:34.820]  I'm a Costco pants convert, dude.
[25:35.280 --> 25:36.160]  That's the reason that I went.
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.160]  I went, dude, I gotta get, I gotta get some fucking pants like Geoff.
[25:39.200 --> 25:40.880]  And I went and I went, oh my god, they're so cheap.
[25:41.560 --> 25:43.640]  They had some, for a little while, they had some really cheap,
[25:43.680 --> 25:45.660]  like, real lightweight Levi's pants that were awesome.
[25:45.980 --> 25:46.900]  That's kind of what I got.
[25:47.060 --> 25:49.560]  Like these, uh, Banana Republic ones that I really like.
[25:49.940 --> 25:51.440]  I have the Banana Republics.
[25:51.500 --> 25:52.520]  Yeah, I like those as well.
[25:52.780 --> 25:54.820]  Merc the Frog's is weatherproof vintage.
[25:54.960 --> 25:59.400]  I got two of the, uh, I got two of the flannel shirts from there and they're like 13 bucks.
[25:59.580 --> 26:00.060]  They're like great.
[26:00.060 --> 26:00.800]  Does anyone remember?
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.100]  One you jump in the middle, one you don't jump in the middle.
[26:04.240 --> 26:04.800]  That's what I remember.
[26:04.800 --> 26:05.380]  I remember that.
[26:05.500 --> 26:06.520]  But is this the jump in the middle?
[26:07.140 --> 26:11.000]  So one of them you do jump in the middle and then the other one is...
[26:11.880 --> 26:14.880]  Outside first, center second, somebody said.
[26:15.860 --> 26:17.340]  That seemed to be backwards from what they said.
[26:17.480 --> 26:18.020]  That's interesting.
[26:18.460 --> 26:19.540]  Can't trust the chat, I see.
[26:19.780 --> 26:20.280]  Set in a second.
[26:20.500 --> 26:21.360]  Who said that?
[26:21.500 --> 26:22.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[26:22.740 --> 26:23.360]  Who said that?
[26:23.740 --> 26:23.900]  See?
[26:24.260 --> 26:24.980]  Can't trust them.
[26:25.380 --> 26:26.100]  It's Oroboro.
[26:26.820 --> 26:27.180]  456.
[26:27.480 --> 26:28.640]  And then now they're just sending dots.
[26:28.860 --> 26:30.040]  They know they got caught, bro.
[26:30.060 --> 26:31.880]  Don't trust the chat so you can't ever listen to the chat.
[26:31.900 --> 26:32.700]  Caught in a lie.
[26:32.980 --> 26:33.160]  Yep.
[26:35.420 --> 26:36.860]  Dude, I'm telling you, I can smell me.
[26:36.920 --> 26:37.260]  It's bad.
[26:38.760 --> 26:39.960]  No, no, no.
[26:41.540 --> 26:42.420]  I forgot.
[26:42.640 --> 26:43.640]  Oh, I just...
[26:43.640 --> 26:46.140]  I forgot.
[26:46.880 --> 26:47.580]  I did.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.820]  I panicked doing it in reverse because I still...
[26:57.820 --> 26:59.280]  Just hitting buttons, just going.
[27:03.010 --> 27:03.410]  Okay.
[27:05.850 --> 27:09.210]  I'm wondering if this is the furthest I've made it with two deaths.
[27:09.730 --> 27:10.130]  Maybe.
[27:10.210 --> 27:12.530]  I don't know why you'd say that, but yeah, maybe.
[27:12.850 --> 27:14.410]  Yeah, just ushered in a third death.
[27:14.590 --> 27:15.630]  Yeah, I mean, that was just like a bad...
[27:15.630 --> 27:17.010]  I mean, this is like bad thinking, don't you think?
[27:17.390 --> 27:18.470]  It's just nice to...
[27:19.090 --> 27:19.810]  There it is.
[27:21.290 --> 27:22.390]  I accidentally jumped there.
[27:22.390 --> 27:23.330]  I better climb back up.
[27:23.690 --> 27:24.190]  Let me kill...
[27:24.190 --> 27:24.830]  I'm gonna do...
[27:24.830 --> 27:28.110]  Let's do that one more time.
[27:33.670 --> 27:37.130]  Half of the chat only tells truths, the other half only tells lies.
[27:38.450 --> 27:39.910]  If you were the other chat...
[27:41.250 --> 27:42.050]  Yep, yep.
[27:42.350 --> 27:43.510]  Dude, you just...
[27:43.510 --> 27:46.630]  You jumped down, got scared, and started climbing back up the ladder.
[27:49.570 --> 27:50.370]  Oh, incredible.
[27:51.510 --> 27:52.410]  Go and tug the...
[27:53.250 --> 27:53.910]  Go tug.
[27:54.090 --> 27:54.710]  Yeah, go tug.
[27:55.590 --> 27:56.650]  What does that do again?
[27:56.790 --> 27:59.070]  Yeah, but don't you have to put something in the cart or something like that?
[27:59.170 --> 27:59.950]  Isn't that what that point is?
[28:04.380 --> 28:04.720]  Hmm.
[28:06.400 --> 28:08.180]  Man, it sucks being thick.
[28:08.360 --> 28:10.200]  I mean, I don't know, I'm just looking at it.
[28:10.240 --> 28:11.500]  I don't remember what you're supposed to do.
[28:11.560 --> 28:12.920]  It just feels like that's what you're supposed to do.
[28:13.620 --> 28:14.260]  Oh, it lifts.
[28:17.460 --> 28:19.500]  Uh, Mark probably oversaw an inspection today.
[28:21.060 --> 28:24.300]  So I have to use this to stand on the other side.
[28:24.400 --> 28:26.380]  A couple of RTUs were installed a few weeks ago,
[28:26.440 --> 28:28.560]  and they got three air conditioners working again at a school.
[28:29.720 --> 28:30.400]  That was Mark's day.
[28:30.600 --> 28:30.940]  Nice.
[28:31.460 --> 28:33.220]  Helping the kids stay, uh, cool.
[28:33.880 --> 28:36.900]  So they can, I guess, go through the remedial summer school.
[28:37.480 --> 28:37.960]  Nothing over here.
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.440]  Keeping them cool frog style, baby.
[28:42.880 --> 28:45.400]  So that's to jump off when the rope is below...
[28:45.400 --> 28:47.480]  Oh god, why do I keep doing that?
[28:49.880 --> 28:50.600]  Slow down!
[28:57.230 --> 28:57.930]  That seems...
[28:57.930 --> 29:00.670]  You got to keep climbing up because the thing goes down
[29:00.670 --> 29:02.290]  and it has to, like, keep going.
[29:02.390 --> 29:03.230]  You have to go, like, far.
[29:03.350 --> 29:04.810]  Yeah, it has to go, like, really, really high up.
[29:05.290 --> 29:07.410]  Because then I think you tie it there or something?
[29:07.450 --> 29:09.010]  You're raising that thing on the right or something, maybe?
[29:09.170 --> 29:09.350]  Yeah.
[29:09.650 --> 29:10.650]  You got to go grab the...
[29:12.690 --> 29:14.170]  You got to go grab it, like that.
[29:14.190 --> 29:15.130]  I suck!
[29:15.310 --> 29:15.790]  Yeah, you suck.
[29:15.970 --> 29:17.110]  Silly bollocks!
[29:17.130 --> 29:17.710]  You suck.
[29:18.450 --> 29:18.690]  Yeah, silly bollocks.
[29:18.690 --> 29:19.890]  I was thinking silly bollocks.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.500]  There you go.
[29:26.600 --> 29:27.040]  Look at him go.
[29:28.700 --> 29:31.160]  Thanks for the sub, ScottishJK47.
[29:34.120 --> 29:35.400]  JK47 is crazy.
[29:39.160 --> 29:40.420]  There you go.
[29:40.740 --> 29:41.980]  Now, where do you put it?
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.220]  Now...
[29:48.220 --> 29:49.580]  I think you got to go and get...
[29:49.580 --> 29:49.680]  Go, go, go!
[29:49.680 --> 29:49.980]  Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[29:49.980 --> 29:50.580]  Run, motherfucker!
[29:50.940 --> 29:51.240]  Run!
[29:51.500 --> 29:52.360]  Oh, he died!
[29:53.200 --> 29:54.160]  Oh, god!
[29:54.760 --> 29:56.360]  Oh, you rammed yourself.
[29:57.580 --> 29:58.060]  Three...
[29:59.620 --> 30:01.400]  Haven't been killed by that before.
[30:02.600 --> 30:03.080]  Three.
[30:03.640 --> 30:03.900]  Yep.
[30:04.600 --> 30:05.080]  Okay.
[30:05.240 --> 30:05.680]  Oh, god.
[30:07.020 --> 30:07.980]  That sucked!
[30:08.140 --> 30:09.960]  It just went too soon!
[30:14.280 --> 30:17.020]  Should I leave when they're, like, the same height as each other?
[30:17.120 --> 30:17.900]  I think so, probably.
[30:18.260 --> 30:18.560]  Yeah.
[30:20.140 --> 30:20.460]  Oh.
[30:21.080 --> 30:21.400]  Yeah.
[30:21.800 --> 30:22.520]  Now, this is learning.
[30:22.920 --> 30:23.240]  Sloppy.
[30:24.880 --> 30:25.200]  Slop.
[30:31.790 --> 30:33.290]  A very unforgiving bonk.
[30:33.770 --> 30:33.990]  Yeah.
[30:36.050 --> 30:37.570]  Um, are you bummed?
[30:37.830 --> 30:40.430]  Are you missing the, uh, the lil' boo-boos at Comic-Con, Geoff?
[30:40.470 --> 30:41.450]  And, like, you're bummed out or what?
[30:42.070 --> 30:44.050]  I wasn't aware that there were lil' boo-boos at Comic-Con.
[30:44.150 --> 30:46.890]  Yeah, dude, they're doing, like, a whole, like, lil' boo-boo thing at Comic-Con, dude.
[30:46.890 --> 30:50.610]  Well, don't let my wife know, otherwise I gotta buy a last-minute ticket to Comic-Con.
[30:52.670 --> 30:53.030]  Ready?
[30:53.730 --> 30:55.010]  All right, you better go, you better hurry!
[30:55.350 --> 30:56.270]  Hurry, bud, hurry!
[30:56.510 --> 30:56.850]  Ah!
[30:57.070 --> 30:57.670]  Nailed it.
[30:57.870 --> 30:58.470]  You're so quick.
[31:00.190 --> 31:02.410]  I think Emily is over lil' boo-boos.
[31:02.510 --> 31:03.790]  She's on to Hossy Poo-Poo.
[31:03.970 --> 31:04.670]  Oh, that's right.
[31:04.790 --> 31:06.850]  She was talking about those a lot.
[31:07.070 --> 31:09.910]  She's into Hossy Poo-Poo and Space Molly and a few others, but, you know.
[31:10.810 --> 31:12.790]  Until there's new lil' boo-boos, and then she'll be on to them.
[31:12.790 --> 31:13.550]  Right, right.
[31:13.930 --> 31:15.470]  She's just got everything she wants, you know.
[31:15.810 --> 31:16.510]  You know how it goes.
[31:17.450 --> 31:18.730]  Where'd that lil' mole go?
[31:20.930 --> 31:21.410]  What?
[31:21.510 --> 31:22.810]  Okay, let's remember...
[31:24.050 --> 31:25.490]  I thought you were talking about something else.
[31:27.350 --> 31:28.090]  Lil' mole!
[31:29.610 --> 31:30.090]  Uh-oh.
[31:35.120 --> 31:36.540]  What is going on?
[31:36.640 --> 31:39.160]  It controls, like, you can't, like, stop walking.
[31:39.160 --> 31:40.020]  I can't stop walking.
[31:42.180 --> 31:43.720]  Do you have to do that?
[31:44.420 --> 31:46.600]  And then eat my top...
[31:46.600 --> 31:47.080]  Oh, damn.
[31:47.520 --> 31:48.020]  Okay, wait.
[31:49.400 --> 31:50.240]  Am I already dead?
[31:50.420 --> 31:50.920]  Starting the game.
[31:52.340 --> 31:53.260]  Have I messed it up already?
[31:53.560 --> 31:54.560]  I don't think so.
[31:54.660 --> 31:54.980]  Are you?
[31:57.600 --> 31:58.540]  I need to...
[31:58.540 --> 31:59.460]  Somebody said no pausing.
[31:59.620 --> 32:00.440]  There's definitely pausing.
[32:00.660 --> 32:01.140]  Yeah, what are you talking about?
[32:01.140 --> 32:02.300]  I need to stand on...
[32:02.300 --> 32:03.240]  Everybody says no, you're fine.
[32:03.320 --> 32:03.940]  Hop over box.
[32:05.460 --> 32:06.260]  I think you're okay.
[32:06.360 --> 32:07.820]  Hop over box, then turn back and push it.
[32:08.060 --> 32:08.360]  Yeah.
[32:08.880 --> 32:09.860]  Yeah, just turn back and push it.
[32:09.880 --> 32:10.480]  Go back the other way.
[32:11.360 --> 32:11.680]  There you go.
[32:12.240 --> 32:12.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:12.420 --> 32:14.020]  I just don't wanna, like, waste the box.
[32:20.680 --> 32:21.000]  Cute.
[32:21.220 --> 32:21.600]  There you go.
[32:21.860 --> 32:22.080]  See?
[32:23.560 --> 32:24.360]  Thanks, Jez.
[32:25.660 --> 32:27.840]  Thanks to everyone who told the truth.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.880]  What exactly are you guys doing?
[32:34.100 --> 32:35.780]  That's a great question for a flat.
[32:36.160 --> 32:37.880]  Every day, waking up, asking that.
[32:38.940 --> 32:40.020]  How did it come to this?
[32:41.040 --> 32:43.520]  What decisions did I make in life that put me here?
[32:47.120 --> 32:49.200]  MrBeast, 308 million views.
[32:53.780 --> 32:54.660]  Dude, that was rough.
[32:55.580 --> 32:57.480]  Pretty crazy when you see them side by side and you go,
[32:57.560 --> 32:58.640]  one of these is a way bigger number.
[33:03.250 --> 33:04.450]  Does anyone remember?
[33:05.050 --> 33:06.550]  You gotta, like, catch them or something?
[33:06.690 --> 33:07.970]  Don't you have to, like, catch that frog or something?
[33:08.290 --> 33:08.450]  No?
[33:10.470 --> 33:11.450]  I have to make water.
[33:12.570 --> 33:13.050]  There you go.
[33:13.530 --> 33:14.410]  Like, you have to piss?
[33:15.610 --> 33:17.030]  Like, in Driving Miss Daisy?
[33:17.250 --> 33:18.590]  I gotta make water, Miss Daisy.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.920]  Yeah, don't you have to, like, catch this guy or something?
[33:24.320 --> 33:24.860]  Yeah, there you go.
[33:25.520 --> 33:26.080]  There you go.
[33:29.600 --> 33:30.560]  You gotta chase him.
[33:30.640 --> 33:32.220]  Yeah, you chase him this way and then he does something.
[33:32.600 --> 33:33.520]  He does the water.
[33:33.800 --> 33:33.960]  Yeah.
[33:34.520 --> 33:35.380]  He runs in that.
[33:35.460 --> 33:36.620]  He goes hamster style.
[33:37.180 --> 33:38.060]  And then I power it.
[33:38.100 --> 33:38.920]  Yeah, you've trapped him now.
[33:38.960 --> 33:39.680]  You've trapped this creature.
[33:40.120 --> 33:40.780]  Give it the lean.
[33:42.220 --> 33:42.620]  Power!
[33:43.580 --> 33:43.980]  Nice.
[33:44.480 --> 33:44.880]  Nice.
[33:45.340 --> 33:47.040]  Oh, is that enough to start it?
[33:47.680 --> 33:50.600]  How many subs for a punishment nickname draft?
[33:50.780 --> 33:51.660]  Now that's interesting.
[33:51.960 --> 33:53.040]  What's a punishment nickname?
[33:53.480 --> 33:57.160]  I guess, like, subs and the audience gets to pick your nickname?
[33:59.140 --> 34:02.700]  Why would I want the audience to participate?
[34:03.480 --> 34:04.360]  I don't know.
[34:06.200 --> 34:07.580]  I'm not pitching it to the audiences.
[34:08.260 --> 34:08.920]  You have to ask them.
[34:08.980 --> 34:09.960]  You're the one that's a good idea.
[34:11.420 --> 34:12.400]  I said it's an interesting idea.
[34:16.770 --> 34:17.690]  Yeah, turn it off now?
[34:19.190 --> 34:20.510]  I think it just has to be more.
[34:21.330 --> 34:22.630]  Ah, it wasn't on prop.
[34:24.310 --> 34:30.230]  You ever play fantasy football, Geoff?
[34:31.150 --> 34:32.610]  Yeah, I play every year.
[34:32.750 --> 34:33.290]  Do you really?
[34:34.030 --> 34:34.990]  Yeah, I play with Emily's family.
[34:35.130 --> 34:36.750]  They have, like, a family fantasy football league.
[34:36.990 --> 34:37.310]  That's cool.
[34:38.090 --> 34:38.970]  Yeah, it's awesome.
[34:39.110 --> 34:40.470]  We do pick-ems every...
[34:42.350 --> 34:43.970]  Yeah, every... we do college and NFL.
[34:45.350 --> 34:46.310]  You want to do it for regulation?
[34:46.850 --> 34:47.530]  No, I don't.
[34:47.590 --> 34:48.310]  It's, like, homework.
[34:49.410 --> 34:50.110]  Not for me.
[34:52.950 --> 34:54.830]  I should probably move the log first, huh?
[34:55.330 --> 34:56.670]  Yeah, it's looking like it.
[35:06.050 --> 35:06.990]  Yeah, I do think...
[35:06.990 --> 35:09.610]  Andrew did play fantasy football with us, I think, two or three...
[35:09.610 --> 35:10.670]  He gets invited every year, but...
[35:11.930 --> 35:13.610]  Did he, like, forget to keep going, though, or something?
[35:13.650 --> 35:15.110]  Yeah, he's forgotten a couple times.
[35:16.150 --> 35:17.770]  He's, like, half-played, like, three times.
[35:27.640 --> 35:28.240]  What am I?
[35:28.820 --> 35:30.060]  Maybe you gotta go a little bit further over?
[35:33.900 --> 35:34.640]  Yeah, must be.
[35:37.620 --> 35:38.280]  Maybe not.
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.680]  Oh, there you go.
[35:43.420 --> 35:46.640]  It sucks to be dumb at the bits that don't require any intelligence.
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.160]  Pat DeMoe, I think this is what Gavin would be, like, in an actual hole.
[36:04.940 --> 36:05.980]  What are you supposed to do here?
[36:06.500 --> 36:07.520]  I need to split the difference.
[36:07.700 --> 36:09.540]  Yeah, I think, uh, not quite.
[36:13.260 --> 36:13.820]  Oh, no.
[36:14.600 --> 36:15.040]  No!
[36:15.380 --> 36:16.120]  Geoff sounds low.
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.380]  I drowned, like, an inch of water!
[36:18.520 --> 36:19.120]  That's four.
[36:19.480 --> 36:19.780]  Four.
[36:21.360 --> 36:21.800]  What?!
[36:21.800 --> 36:23.320]  Why would I drown there?
[36:23.720 --> 36:24.980]  I don't know, why'd you do that?
[36:26.180 --> 36:28.880]  Well, obviously, I was assuming that it would go down.
[36:29.360 --> 36:29.640]  Yeah.
[36:30.920 --> 36:31.360]  Wow.
[36:32.180 --> 36:32.820]  Up to four now.
[36:32.820 --> 36:36.600]  That one, I feel like, is only 50% on me.
[36:38.220 --> 36:39.320]  Okay, sure.
[36:39.620 --> 36:39.680]  Okay.
[36:39.900 --> 36:41.080]  Still counts as one.
[36:45.280 --> 36:49.980]  Thank you, AMW0914, for the sub.
[36:50.280 --> 36:52.000]  Thank you, Sweep, for the sub.
[36:55.310 --> 36:56.390]  This is what Gavin would be like.
[36:56.390 --> 36:58.570]  Is Gavin wearing a shirt to prompt anything today?
[36:58.670 --> 36:59.330]  Plain shirt.
[37:00.030 --> 37:01.090]  Box-standard shirt.
[37:01.430 --> 37:03.550]  Gavin proved all those PSAs when I was a kid
[37:03.550 --> 37:04.830]  that you can drown in a teaspoon of water.
[37:06.910 --> 37:08.510]  Turn around, don't drown.
[37:10.110 --> 37:11.130]  Thanks, Mad Burrito.
[37:14.910 --> 37:16.510]  All right, so I just need...
[37:17.750 --> 37:18.170]  A clue?
[37:18.810 --> 37:20.090]  Is it five or less?
[37:20.890 --> 37:21.170]  Oops.
[37:21.810 --> 37:22.690]  What are you doing?
[37:23.370 --> 37:24.250]  Five or less.
[37:24.510 --> 37:24.810]  There you go.
[37:25.270 --> 37:25.950]  So you just can't...
[37:26.910 --> 37:28.010]  You shouldn't die again.
[37:28.090 --> 37:30.010]  Yeah, you should not die again, I would think.
[37:30.790 --> 37:32.550]  But you can die one more time.
[37:33.210 --> 37:34.650]  Yeah, but you shouldn't.
[37:37.650 --> 37:39.490]  Now you're thinking too hard.
[37:40.510 --> 37:41.270]  So you have four.
[37:42.130 --> 37:42.390]  Yeah.
[37:42.430 --> 37:44.570]  And you have to do it with five or less.
[37:44.610 --> 37:45.010]  Or less.
[37:45.050 --> 37:45.310]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:45.570 --> 37:46.530]  But just ignore the less.
[37:46.890 --> 37:48.510]  Or I suppose, would it be fewer?
[37:48.770 --> 37:51.010]  I guess it doesn't matter, but you know, it's just, you know.
[37:52.170 --> 37:52.630]  Being pedantic.
[37:52.630 --> 37:54.330]  Yeah, just don't die like Jack the Stripper said.
[37:55.930 --> 37:57.090]  Jack the Stripper.
[37:58.270 --> 37:58.990]  Oh, man.
[37:59.630 --> 38:02.270]  You guys in the chat don't get enough credit for your names.
[38:02.530 --> 38:03.030]  No, it's good.
[38:03.030 --> 38:05.810]  It's the, uh, it's the funniest part.
[38:07.450 --> 38:08.750]  Version 8 says fewer, yeah.
[38:09.390 --> 38:10.350]  I'm gonna need this for...
[38:11.170 --> 38:13.110]  You got to probably drag it over there, huh?
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.420]  I just don't want to move it and then need it to...
[38:21.420 --> 38:22.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:22.780 --> 38:24.280]  Have the head...
[38:24.280 --> 38:25.960]  Got a Hulk Hogan talking in the chat.
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.040]  It seems to be a very conflicting death.
[38:28.080 --> 38:28.540]  I don't know why.
[38:28.760 --> 38:30.500]  That should not be conflicting to anyone.
[38:34.730 --> 38:36.670]  Okay, it's gonna fill the room.
[38:36.850 --> 38:37.010]  Okay.
[38:37.190 --> 38:37.470]  Yeah, there you go.
[38:38.270 --> 38:39.450]  So I do this...
[38:42.730 --> 38:46.260]  And then...
[38:46.260 --> 38:51.240]  Oh, and I need to push the box back under that.
[38:53.060 --> 38:57.680]  I'm being quiet on purpose, Iron Renth, because I'm real close to Gavin and I'm trying not to
[38:57.680 --> 39:00.020]  get picked up by his mic so you guys don't get echo.
[39:00.620 --> 39:02.100]  You can sit on the other mic.
[39:02.920 --> 39:03.680]  No, I'm fine over here.
[39:04.280 --> 39:04.480]  Okay.
[39:04.660 --> 39:05.280]  This is my desk.
[39:05.640 --> 39:06.780]  You're gonna run me off of my desk?
[39:07.120 --> 39:07.720]  Go fuck yourself.
[39:07.920 --> 39:09.380]  You guys picked to sit next to each other.
[39:09.380 --> 39:12.560]  You kept talking about how you were excited because it's the first time you ever got to do that.
[39:12.940 --> 39:15.780]  Because we've never, in our entire crew, we've never got to sit next to each other.
[39:15.860 --> 39:17.760]  Well, aside from Congress backroom.
[39:18.920 --> 39:19.620]  Yeah, that's true.
[39:20.340 --> 39:21.300]  We were doing different stuff.
[39:21.480 --> 39:23.220]  You were always working on RVB and I was working on Chimera.
[39:26.220 --> 39:30.200]  I don't want to mess up, but I feel like I need something to float through this hole.
[39:32.040 --> 39:32.400]  Okay.
[39:36.020 --> 39:38.140]  Well, won't the box go up if the water comes in?
[39:39.900 --> 39:40.260]  Yeah.
[39:41.220 --> 39:41.660]  Okay.
[39:47.830 --> 39:48.270]  Just...
[39:48.270 --> 39:50.550]  This is what Gavin would be like in a hole.
[39:50.990 --> 39:52.670]  Okay, so that's not what does the water.
[39:56.620 --> 39:57.700]  So this can go here?
[39:59.360 --> 39:59.800]  Okay.
[40:00.540 --> 40:01.000]  All right.
[40:02.740 --> 40:04.140]  What does the water again?
[40:06.440 --> 40:08.400]  Thanks for the sub, Kully.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.600]  Then this, so clunk.
[40:14.440 --> 40:15.140]  Open that.
[40:16.480 --> 40:18.000]  I can pre-open it, can't I?
[40:20.900 --> 40:23.220]  Goji said Aussie died in the world mourned for Aussie.
[40:23.280 --> 40:25.080]  Hulk Hogan died in the world mourned for Aussie.
[40:26.800 --> 40:27.280]  Pretty true.
[40:28.000 --> 40:28.660]  That is kind of true.
[40:29.440 --> 40:30.360]  There you go.
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.360]  So what was the confusion?
[40:33.500 --> 40:34.920]  You just weren't sure what like the parts were?
[40:35.660 --> 40:37.200]  I just did thinking about the order.
[40:37.520 --> 40:37.860]  Got it.
[40:38.380 --> 40:38.820]  Got it.
[40:43.450 --> 40:45.650]  Oh yeah, that was, we haven't talked about that.
[40:45.650 --> 40:46.610]  But Chuck Mangione died.
[40:46.710 --> 40:46.990]  And that was...
[40:46.990 --> 40:47.930]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[40:50.330 --> 40:51.510]  Right before King of the Hill.
[40:52.610 --> 40:57.370]  He, uh, I was talking about, we were watching old Chuck Mangione videos last night.
[40:57.410 --> 40:58.610]  Emily and I talking about it.
[40:58.690 --> 41:03.250]  And I feel like he, that kind of, that kind of music and musician can't.
[41:05.290 --> 41:07.990]  Return to, can't find prominence in 2025.
[41:08.430 --> 41:12.290]  Like there's no trumpet leading musician in 2025.
[41:12.590 --> 41:13.490]  Right, right, right, right.
[41:13.710 --> 41:14.830]  Yeah, no, I get what you're saying.
[41:16.850 --> 41:18.570]  Oh, Gavin's on a run right now.
[41:18.710 --> 41:19.190]  Look at him go.
[41:19.630 --> 41:21.110]  Look at him go, folks.
[41:21.390 --> 41:23.170]  Can anything stop this man?
[41:23.910 --> 41:24.410]  Oh, I need to...
[41:26.250 --> 41:27.230]  Right, and then...
[41:28.670 --> 41:29.070]  Do I?
[41:33.450 --> 41:35.190]  I need that to go in the plug.
[41:35.410 --> 41:35.670]  Okay.
[41:36.710 --> 41:38.030]  Do I need to push that plugwood?
[41:40.090 --> 41:42.030]  Thanks for the sub, Buck Nasty.
[41:42.030 --> 41:45.030]  I, that kind of, uh.
[41:45.830 --> 41:48.310]  You think it's going to go over where you need it to go or no?
[41:49.130 --> 41:50.470]  I think probably it's not.
[41:50.890 --> 41:51.890]  Yeah, I think probably it's not.
[41:54.150 --> 41:55.330]  But maybe it will.
[41:55.470 --> 41:55.610]  Uh-huh.
[41:55.730 --> 41:56.450]  Maybe it'll raise up.
[41:56.550 --> 41:57.090]  This might be five voice.
[41:57.230 --> 42:00.270]  Yeah, the, um, the chat's already given us five in salutes.
[42:01.030 --> 42:01.430]  Yeah.
[42:02.530 --> 42:03.370]  Rough train, bud.
[42:05.030 --> 42:06.170]  What do you think?
[42:10.730 --> 42:12.610]  Just like Kurt Russell in Poseidon Adventure.
[42:16.230 --> 42:17.570]  Yeah, that's my...
[42:18.110 --> 42:19.670]  Fucking Jarvis says, no trumpet leads.
[42:19.790 --> 42:20.890]  What about Streetlight Manifesto?
[42:20.990 --> 42:21.290]  They don't...
[42:22.170 --> 42:22.890]  Hey, hey.
[42:23.210 --> 42:25.330]  What about Streetlight Manifesto?
[42:25.610 --> 42:26.450]  They're not instrumental.
[42:26.750 --> 42:27.390]  They have lyrics.
[42:27.950 --> 42:28.590]  You missed, you missed.
[42:29.390 --> 42:30.190]  Thomas sings.
[42:30.430 --> 42:30.730]  That's six.
[42:30.830 --> 42:31.570]  Keep it going, Gavin.
[42:31.650 --> 42:32.410]  You got to keep learning.
[42:32.710 --> 42:35.090]  Fuck, I mean, oh God.
[42:35.470 --> 42:35.730]  That was six.
[42:36.350 --> 42:37.150]  All right, start over.
[42:38.150 --> 42:39.790]  You might as well do it just to, yeah.
[42:40.090 --> 42:40.870]  So you don't fuck it up next time.
[42:40.870 --> 42:41.830]  You gotta learn.
[42:42.670 --> 42:44.110]  You gotta stay down here, I think.
[42:44.170 --> 42:45.330]  Because you gotta move that thing.
[42:45.490 --> 42:46.790]  And you gotta, yeah, there you go.
[42:47.410 --> 42:47.850]  There you go.
[42:48.550 --> 42:49.110]  Look at you.
[42:49.730 --> 42:50.410]  Yeah, look at you.
[42:50.490 --> 42:50.890]  There you go.
[42:51.370 --> 42:53.510]  Well, I remember it now, don't I?
[42:53.690 --> 42:54.170]  Oh, do you?
[42:54.730 --> 42:55.050]  Yeah.
[42:59.550 --> 43:00.430]  Silly schmuck hole.
[43:00.670 --> 43:01.250]  Push the scrotum.
[43:02.650 --> 43:03.190]  There you go.
[43:05.030 --> 43:05.950]  Look at him go, folks.
[43:12.480 --> 43:13.520]  This is all training, though.
[43:13.860 --> 43:14.340]  It is.
[43:14.440 --> 43:16.040]  That's the point of this stream, by the way.
[43:16.200 --> 43:17.460]  He's not trying to do it.
[43:17.640 --> 43:18.260]  He's just trying.
[43:18.380 --> 43:18.980]  He's learning.
[43:19.140 --> 43:20.740]  And if he happens to do it, wow, that's incredible.
[43:20.740 --> 43:21.520]  But there's no shot.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.820]  Oh, Elbow Deep and Jorky Belfast back again with more subs.
[43:25.840 --> 43:26.800]  Jorky Belfast is back?
[43:27.160 --> 43:27.480]  Oh my god.
[43:27.480 --> 43:29.560]  Gavin loves Elbow Deep, hates Jorky Belfast.
[43:29.600 --> 43:30.660]  Yeah, what is that, dude?
[43:30.720 --> 43:31.420]  Nobody knows why.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.340]  I'm a huge Jorky guy.
[43:33.420 --> 43:34.420]  Happa skappa sallywap.
[43:34.660 --> 43:35.480]  Thank you very much.
[43:36.780 --> 43:40.020]  For being a first-time chatter and allowing me to say that name.
[43:49.600 --> 43:53.420]  All right, you're gonna have to restart the game now, I think.
[43:56.660 --> 43:57.380]  Thanks, JTrain.
[43:58.060 --> 43:58.840]  JTrain a coming.
[44:07.700 --> 44:09.100]  Oh, I remember this part.
[44:10.900 --> 44:13.260]  I don't remember what you're supposed to do, but I remember it.
[44:14.400 --> 44:15.520]  Uh, you know, do I open it?
[44:15.620 --> 44:16.480]  I like, re-level it?
[44:16.720 --> 44:17.380]  I think so.
[44:19.900 --> 44:20.260]  Ah!
[44:26.940 --> 44:27.740]  Doesn't seem right.
[44:37.070 --> 44:39.150]  Candles wants to know if we think Dan could do this.
[44:41.050 --> 44:42.110]  He might have already done it.
[44:42.290 --> 44:43.110]  He's pretty good at games.
[44:43.430 --> 44:43.590]  Yeah.
[44:43.790 --> 44:44.410]  He used to be, at least.
[44:50.300 --> 44:50.860]  Now what?
[44:53.520 --> 44:53.960]  Yeah.
[44:55.200 --> 44:56.660]  Outside first, inside second.
[45:02.820 --> 45:05.140]  Well, stop jumping off the ladder.
[45:07.500 --> 45:08.940]  Yeah, so you gotta re-level it.
[45:10.320 --> 45:11.800]  And then maybe you raise it again?
[45:13.660 --> 45:14.440]  Raise it again?
[45:14.520 --> 45:15.320]  No, no, no, no, no.
[45:15.440 --> 45:17.240]  The, I'm sorry, lower the big block.
[45:17.880 --> 45:19.020]  And then maybe that's enough.
[45:19.020 --> 45:19.920]  The opposite of what you said?
[45:21.280 --> 45:22.440]  Geoff beat him up.
[45:23.080 --> 45:26.020]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[45:27.500 --> 45:28.720]  Sir Ham Bino.
[45:30.600 --> 45:31.500]  That's a great name.
[45:32.740 --> 45:34.140]  Shout out to you, Sir Ham Bino.
[45:34.300 --> 45:35.360]  That might be, that might be, I don't know.
[45:35.360 --> 45:36.960]  He's been in the ham zone since birth, apparently.
[45:37.820 --> 45:39.200]  There you go. Way to go, man.
[45:40.080 --> 45:40.860]  Rainbow Dogma.
[45:41.560 --> 45:41.840]  What's up?
[45:47.350 --> 45:50.550]  All right, so I need to think about this box.
[45:50.730 --> 45:50.990]  Okay.
[45:51.030 --> 45:52.010]  I need it.
[45:52.090 --> 45:53.050]  Gotta think about this box.
[45:56.050 --> 45:58.710]  To... jump back up here and get the light.
[46:01.750 --> 46:07.130]  So I need to... move it?
[46:08.190 --> 46:09.250]  I like to move it.
[46:09.510 --> 46:10.190]  Move it, move it.
[46:10.330 --> 46:10.510]  Yeah.
[46:10.950 --> 46:12.750]  Lemurs, the original minions.
[46:14.810 --> 46:16.310]  Do I pull it now?
[46:16.730 --> 46:17.010]  Yeah.
[46:19.150 --> 46:20.550]  Is this Geoff, Gavin, and Michael?
[46:20.690 --> 46:21.270]  Yes, it is.
[46:21.330 --> 46:21.870]  Yeah, what's up?
[46:21.870 --> 46:22.730]  It's me, Michael.
[46:25.270 --> 46:26.230]  Michael, you sound...
[46:26.230 --> 46:26.650]  Well, that wasn't right.
[46:26.910 --> 46:27.850]  ...different. You sound...
[46:27.850 --> 46:29.690]  Yeah, you sound, yeah, I sound nothing like Michael.
[46:29.890 --> 46:31.370]  Yeah, it's weird. Maybe I have a cold or something.
[46:33.850 --> 46:35.050]  Okay, we're still counting, huh?
[46:35.870 --> 46:36.810]  Oh yeah, that's seven, buddy.
[46:36.830 --> 46:38.490]  Thanks. Thanks, chat.
[46:43.490 --> 46:44.710]  Eric is recycling tweets.
[46:45.630 --> 46:50.010]  Mark the Frog is disgruntled with the state of the rental situation in Florida.
[46:50.170 --> 46:50.690]  I hear that.
[46:52.670 --> 46:53.490]  You gotta go right.
[46:53.590 --> 46:55.350]  You gotta go right first, I think, and then you gotta go left.
[46:55.350 --> 46:56.350]  You gotta push the box or whatever.
[46:56.830 --> 46:59.010]  You gotta get, like, you let it control you.
[46:59.090 --> 47:02.370]  You go right and then you go quickly left to push the box, maybe?
[47:03.290 --> 47:03.670]  You know what I mean?
[47:03.710 --> 47:04.930]  I go right and then left?
[47:05.090 --> 47:06.770]  Well, you go right to get on the other side of the box.
[47:07.830 --> 47:10.550]  And then you go left because the thing will be continuously pushing.
[47:11.390 --> 47:13.690]  And then you climb on the box, like, you jump and you go.
[47:13.790 --> 47:15.550]  Also up to eight. Does that make sense?
[47:15.690 --> 47:17.690]  Like, you're saying go right, I need to...
[47:17.690 --> 47:19.370]  I'm just trying to pull the box, aren't I?
[47:19.830 --> 47:21.170]  I don't know that you can pull the box.
[47:21.210 --> 47:22.990]  I think the thing will get you before you can pull it.
[47:24.450 --> 47:27.870]  So what I'm saying is, do you maybe have to let it get you?
[47:27.930 --> 47:29.150]  You're on the other side?
[47:29.470 --> 47:32.550]  It says pull the box when the slug is swinging the other way.
[47:32.650 --> 47:34.550]  Oh, look at that.
[47:34.730 --> 47:37.910]  I felt like I tried to do that the first time and I failed.
[47:38.170 --> 47:39.970]  Right, you tried to do it the first time.
[47:46.120 --> 47:46.780]  There you go.
[47:51.100 --> 47:51.460]  Sweet.
[47:52.320 --> 47:53.100]  Do I need the box now?
[47:54.060 --> 47:55.540]  Did this thing get off of you?
[47:57.120 --> 47:57.480]  No.
[47:58.300 --> 47:59.300]  Oh, does it stay on you?
[48:00.420 --> 48:02.160]  I thought the light made it go away.
[48:02.860 --> 48:03.740]  No, it turns you around.
[48:04.260 --> 48:04.620]  Oh.
[48:05.360 --> 48:06.360]  I wasn't aware of that.
[48:07.080 --> 48:08.820]  I thought you could control which way you were going.
[48:09.200 --> 48:10.500]  That's why I said go right, then go left.
[48:13.960 --> 48:15.360]  Oh, you're just guessing, huh?
[48:15.440 --> 48:15.620]  Okay.
[48:17.980 --> 48:18.900]  We're guessing what?
[48:23.500 --> 48:24.820]  All right, now it's a race.
[48:25.260 --> 48:26.120]  Let's get out of here.
[48:28.480 --> 48:30.100]  Emily Coates is officially a comment leaver.
[48:30.340 --> 48:31.420]  Congratulations, welcome to the club.
[48:32.200 --> 48:33.600]  The best of us are comment leavers.
[48:38.950 --> 48:41.130]  Somebody said, what an attitude from a guy with eight deaths.
[48:46.910 --> 48:50.950]  The only way to fight Eric's attitude is with a little bit of my own.
[48:51.090 --> 48:53.110]  Yeah, I mean, I'm just fine with that.
[48:54.670 --> 48:56.430]  It's like just a couple of cats hissing.
[48:56.630 --> 48:56.810]  Yeah.
[48:57.010 --> 48:59.710]  So do you know how to hiss forward in this?
[48:59.790 --> 49:00.330]  Do you know what you're doing?
[49:02.170 --> 49:03.210]  Oh, I need to go all the way.
[49:03.290 --> 49:04.050]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[49:04.050 --> 49:05.450]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[49:05.450 --> 49:06.570]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:06.570 --> 49:09.410]  I need to not wait on that ladder for a minute straight.
[49:09.410 --> 49:11.270]  Oh, for like 60 full seconds?
[49:11.370 --> 49:11.750]  That's weird.
[49:12.050 --> 49:13.950]  Wow, a lot of nines in the chat coming through.
[49:14.890 --> 49:16.190]  That's the thing, I need to jump on.
[49:16.410 --> 49:17.450]  Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss.
[49:24.290 --> 49:25.450]  Hey, MarkTheFrog is right.
[49:25.570 --> 49:27.170]  Why wouldn't somebody want to be a comment leaver?
[49:27.410 --> 49:28.890]  Closed mouths don't get fed.
[49:29.270 --> 49:29.770]  That's what's up.
[49:30.590 --> 49:31.310]  Ah, there you go.
[49:31.390 --> 49:31.790]  MarkTheFrog.
[49:32.190 --> 49:33.050]  MarkTheFrog gets it.
[49:33.990 --> 49:34.930]  MarkTheFrog gets it.
[49:34.930 --> 49:37.870]  MarkTheFrog also tweeted the other day,
[49:37.950 --> 49:39.870]  regulation listeners have four and a half jokes.
[49:42.930 --> 49:44.450]  Never had something more true.
[49:45.750 --> 49:47.590]  Hey, it's three more jokes than Achievement Hunter.
[49:48.090 --> 49:49.690]  Hey, you know what?
[49:49.790 --> 49:50.850]  We're upgrading.
[49:57.980 --> 49:58.980]  Oh, look at you.
[49:59.540 --> 50:01.540]  I think I failed this enough times to remember this bit.
[50:01.560 --> 50:01.880]  You got it.
[50:01.960 --> 50:02.800]  Yeah, I think you're doing it.
[50:04.040 --> 50:05.720]  Now you just have to wait and you're in business.
[50:10.060 --> 50:11.700]  If you guys have any HVAC questions
[50:11.700 --> 50:13.020]  while we're waiting for Gavin to beat this,
[50:13.080 --> 50:14.080]  you can ask MarkTheFrog.
[50:14.140 --> 50:14.600]  He'll help you out.
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.440]  He always loves to help out.
[50:23.590 --> 50:25.050]  Oh, oh my God.
[50:25.070 --> 50:26.170]  It was very...
[50:26.170 --> 50:27.810]  You knew it was going to keep moving you right.
[50:29.030 --> 50:29.370]  Yeah.
[50:29.570 --> 50:30.250]  You have to wait.
[50:30.550 --> 50:32.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because I got the worm still.
[50:33.530 --> 50:33.930]  Yeah.
[50:34.230 --> 50:34.510]  Ten.
[50:36.850 --> 50:37.250]  Ten.
[50:38.990 --> 50:39.970]  Double digits, boys.
[50:40.870 --> 50:42.150]  I've got the worm.
[50:42.450 --> 50:43.610]  If I could get...
[50:44.630 --> 50:45.830]  Now I'm getting impatient.
[50:45.970 --> 50:47.110]  What are you doing?
[50:47.770 --> 50:50.410]  You have to wait for so long for that thing.
[50:50.510 --> 50:51.250]  You might as well just wait.
[50:51.330 --> 50:51.990]  That's 11.
[50:55.870 --> 50:59.250]  This can't be the attitude that you bring to the Falcon event tonight, Gavin.
[50:59.850 --> 51:00.110]  Yeah.
[51:01.450 --> 51:04.030]  Well, no, there'll be way less pressure during the Falcon event.
[51:05.250 --> 51:06.590]  All I know...
[51:06.590 --> 51:07.050]  I hope we see everybody there tonight.
[51:07.110 --> 51:08.370]  I'm going to be so sad if we don't.
[51:08.470 --> 51:13.450]  Yeah, me and Gavin already kind of picked one song each to go in that playlist, but...
[51:14.030 --> 51:14.850]  I have one too.
[51:15.530 --> 51:16.050]  I picked one.
[51:16.410 --> 51:17.010]  Did you send it?
[51:17.950 --> 51:18.850]  Oh, I didn't send it.
[51:18.890 --> 51:19.910]  I don't know where you guys were putting them.
[51:21.250 --> 51:21.810]  Text message?
[51:22.510 --> 51:23.610]  Hmm, let's see.
[51:30.480 --> 51:32.880]  Is this one of the situations where you weren't getting our texts again or something?
[51:34.220 --> 51:35.500]  Uh, where did the text go?
[51:35.540 --> 51:36.700]  Was it everybody or just you and Gavin?
[51:36.940 --> 51:37.720]  I think it was just...
[51:37.720 --> 51:38.300]  No, no, no, no.
[51:38.300 --> 51:39.160]  It was everybody.
[51:39.540 --> 51:40.040]  Oh, it's everybody.
[51:40.040 --> 51:40.840]  From like a few days ago.
[51:41.480 --> 51:42.460]  You can pick and it says...
[51:42.460 --> 51:43.480]  Gavin, what did you...
[51:43.480 --> 51:44.440]  What guy did you meet last weekend?
[51:44.720 --> 51:45.960]  Oh, yeah, I was just talking to a...
[51:47.280 --> 51:50.840]  A regulation listener and they were chatting about regulation and stuff.
[51:51.040 --> 51:51.620]  It was nice.
[51:51.760 --> 51:54.420]  And then at the end, he stated that he still wasn't a comment leaver.
[51:54.600 --> 51:55.140]  Oh, wow.
[51:55.500 --> 51:57.260]  To inform him that that was no longer possible.
[51:57.300 --> 51:58.000]  Yeah, it's not true.
[51:58.300 --> 51:59.660]  He's an in-person comment leaver.
[52:00.080 --> 52:01.780]  Leaving comments directly into my ear hole.
[52:02.040 --> 52:02.200]  Yep.
[52:08.320 --> 52:09.620]  But, uh, you know, he took it...
[52:09.620 --> 52:10.960]  Oh, God, I've died again, haven't I?
[52:14.540 --> 52:15.500]  He took the feedback.
[52:15.880 --> 52:16.560]  He took it well.
[52:16.840 --> 52:18.080]  And he came to terms with it.
[52:18.340 --> 52:18.600]  Oh, good.
[52:18.600 --> 52:21.560]  Listen, Mermaid Sparrow, I'm 50 years old.
[52:21.720 --> 52:23.860]  I have no desire to conquer a snake fear.
[52:24.040 --> 52:25.280]  I've made it pretty far...
[52:25.280 --> 52:25.380]  Yeah.
[52:25.540 --> 52:26.860]  ...in life, uh, hating them.
[52:27.100 --> 52:27.940]  I'm happy to go on.
[52:27.980 --> 52:28.600]  I think I don't have...
[52:28.600 --> 52:29.140]  A snake hater.
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.500]  Yeah, at no point have I ever thought, we gotta get Geoff over this thing.
[52:32.660 --> 52:34.520]  We just sort of, like, let Geoff be afraid of snakes.
[52:35.140 --> 52:35.420]  Yeah.
[52:36.720 --> 52:40.680]  I had a bunch of experiences in my life that shaped that opinion and I'm happy, uh...
[52:42.000 --> 52:42.680]  I'll leave it at that.
[52:43.000 --> 52:43.880]  What are you supposed to do here?
[52:43.880 --> 52:44.860]  I don't need to be the bigger man.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.900]  Oh, my God, wow.
[52:46.460 --> 52:47.080]  Speaking of Geoff...
[52:47.620 --> 52:47.940]  That's crazy.
[52:47.940 --> 52:49.340]  Geoff, you get $500,000.
[52:49.700 --> 52:50.060]  Thank you.
[52:50.320 --> 52:58.420]  Tax-free, but there is, and always has been, a snake, uh, just going up and down your intestines.
[52:59.020 --> 52:59.220]  No.
[53:01.480 --> 53:02.200]  Absolutely not.
[53:03.440 --> 53:05.120]  I would, knowing that there was...
[53:05.120 --> 53:05.480]  It's been there for 50 years.
[53:05.580 --> 53:07.760]  Knowing that there's a snake inside of me, I'd have to cut it out.
[53:09.840 --> 53:11.140]  You'd have to cut it out?
[53:11.540 --> 53:12.440]  Even if it doesn't change...
[53:12.440 --> 53:14.180]  I can't have it living inside of me, are you kidding?
[53:14.360 --> 53:15.360]  It always has been there.
[53:16.260 --> 53:19.160]  Hey, you're just, you're just Geoff the Snake Guy, guy with a guy with a snake in him.
[53:19.240 --> 53:22.320]  No, I'm sorry, I'm Geoff the Snake Guy with too much information now.
[53:29.970 --> 53:31.770]  Oh, I don't think you can probably touch that.
[53:31.970 --> 53:33.070]  Yeah, I don't think you can probably touch that.
[53:33.550 --> 53:35.490]  This is around where we ended last time.
[53:35.510 --> 53:36.250]  It is.
[53:36.270 --> 53:38.570]  Did you end with 36 deaths last time, like this time?
[53:38.670 --> 53:40.570]  Yeah, it's only at 11.
[53:44.990 --> 53:45.630]  That was...
[53:45.630 --> 53:46.610]  That was very close.
[53:47.690 --> 53:48.890]  That was pretty close, wasn't it?
[53:53.210 --> 53:54.230]  Oh, that's on for good.
[53:54.710 --> 53:56.250]  Is it? What are you supposed to do? Go down?
[53:57.530 --> 53:57.850]  Whoops!
[53:58.650 --> 54:00.370]  Other side of the O, guys. Other side of the O.
[54:00.590 --> 54:01.890]  That'd be 12, boys.
[54:06.930 --> 54:08.130]  I like seeing the chat.
[54:08.570 --> 54:11.690]  12, 12, 12, 12, 12, dipshit, 12, 12, 12.
[54:11.870 --> 54:12.590]  Not like that.
[54:12.690 --> 54:13.710]  12, 12, 12.
[54:19.790 --> 54:20.190]  Nice.
[54:20.530 --> 54:20.770]  No!
[54:22.390 --> 54:23.190]  Oh, wow!
[54:25.670 --> 54:27.070]  Oh, nice. And now you got a rope.
[54:28.170 --> 54:29.050]  Got me on a rope.
[54:29.490 --> 54:29.850]  There you go.
[54:33.110 --> 54:33.830]  Ka-thunk.
[54:34.950 --> 54:35.310]  Nice.
[54:38.430 --> 54:40.330]  Nice. No hesitation.
[54:41.390 --> 54:43.970]  Now, I think the best way to learn is to pretend like I'm on three.
[54:44.170 --> 54:45.470]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[54:45.590 --> 54:45.930]  I'm not.
[54:46.210 --> 54:50.350]  But the problem is, you're not going to do this again for four months, and you're going to remember any of this.
[54:50.450 --> 54:51.510]  Well, let me do it. Let me do it in two weeks.
[54:51.810 --> 54:52.790]  Okay, it's only two weeks.
[54:52.790 --> 54:54.070]  Well, nobody's stopping you.
[54:54.130 --> 54:56.190]  I don't know who's... you just have to say I'm doing this.
[54:57.910 --> 54:58.270]  Okay.
[54:59.870 --> 55:03.530]  I just don't want this to be every stream every week for the next six months, you know?
[55:03.570 --> 55:05.950]  It doesn't have to be. You can just do this whenever you want to.
[55:06.690 --> 55:06.930]  Shit.
[55:07.190 --> 55:08.050]  Well, why'd you do that?
[55:09.410 --> 55:09.770]  Ow.
[55:13.050 --> 55:19.070]  What do I do? Do I just go back up? And then I don't just stand on that?
[55:19.970 --> 55:20.330]  13.
[55:20.770 --> 55:20.990]  13.
[55:25.820 --> 55:28.760]  This is the ultimate fight or flight or freeze game.
[55:43.280 --> 55:44.800]  How's your dog doing, Geoff?
[55:45.920 --> 55:47.200]  He's good. Why do you ask?
[55:47.300 --> 55:49.240]  I don't know. I'm just curious. I'm just curious about your dog.
[55:51.160 --> 55:53.800]  He's been, uh... he's had a lot of energy this week.
[55:54.180 --> 55:54.420]  Oh, yeah?
[55:55.020 --> 55:56.940]  Yeah. He goes to daycare tomorrow.
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.440]  Play with other dogs.
[55:59.780 --> 55:59.940]  Nice.
[55:59.940 --> 56:02.240]  Oh, shit. What's this bit all about?
[56:02.680 --> 56:03.800]  I don't know. This doesn't look familiar.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.380]  An old conservatory?
[56:05.760 --> 56:06.000]  Uh-oh.
[56:08.440 --> 56:09.200]  Looks scary.
[56:10.940 --> 56:12.260]  How are your cats doing, Gavin?
[56:13.540 --> 56:15.880]  Pretty good. Had some good cuddle time with Smee today.
[56:16.260 --> 56:16.620]  Wow.
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.850]  How's your dog doing, Eric?
[56:22.610 --> 56:26.210]  He's just fine. Just hanging out. Got a haircut today. Looking sharp.
[56:26.250 --> 56:26.850]  Oh, nice.
[56:27.030 --> 56:29.770]  Yeah. She takes care of everything.
[56:29.790 --> 56:30.470]  Strutting around.
[56:30.470 --> 56:32.070]  Yeah, she cuts his hair and...
[56:34.050 --> 56:37.110]  like, does stuff to his anal glands and then trims his nails.
[56:37.110 --> 56:38.630]  Oh, yeah. Express those glands.
[56:39.850 --> 56:42.250]  Why don't dogs do their own glands? Is it like an evolution thing?
[56:42.250 --> 56:43.110]  I don't know.
[56:43.490 --> 56:46.390]  They try to, but sometimes they get inflamed and stuff.
[56:46.610 --> 56:47.530]  Oh, my God.
[56:50.290 --> 56:53.010]  That was just like a real accident that could occur.
[56:53.430 --> 56:56.210]  Yeah. That was like the least cinematic way that could have happened.
[56:57.470 --> 57:00.250]  Somebody said because they don't have fingers to stick up their own asses.
[57:01.450 --> 57:03.870]  Yeah, but why did they evolve to need a finger up the ass?
[57:04.590 --> 57:05.130]  That's a good question.
[57:05.230 --> 57:06.190]  Beats me, dude. I don't know.
[57:06.710 --> 57:08.810]  I need to pull this down before getting the grub, I assume.
[57:09.130 --> 57:11.810]  I think so. Did it work?
[57:13.150 --> 57:14.010]  Oh, you died again.
[57:16.330 --> 57:18.310]  Death by modfit. Here comes 15.
[57:25.250 --> 57:28.110]  Now I get the grub. Do I need the grub?
[57:28.990 --> 57:30.290]  If it's there, I would assume so.
[57:31.150 --> 57:32.430]  Be weird for a...
[57:34.770 --> 57:37.650]  If we were to do Nick doing Last of Us again...
[57:40.750 --> 57:42.110]  Where does that live?
[57:43.410 --> 57:46.470]  Because no one... just looking at the numbers when we put it up,
[57:46.550 --> 57:48.630]  people just go, well, I certainly don't want this content.
[57:49.750 --> 57:52.430]  I know. That's the struggle. And that's where...
[57:53.770 --> 57:57.310]  Gavin and Andrew and I had a very long conversation about that a couple weeks ago.
[57:57.410 --> 57:57.730]  Oh, really?
[57:57.730 --> 58:00.450]  Yeah, just about... I looped you in about it.
[58:00.630 --> 58:06.510]  But just about the confusion of where does that kind of stream content go if we increase it.
[58:07.110 --> 58:07.390]  I don't know.
[58:07.810 --> 58:11.710]  Yeah, right now, our main struggle is when one of us wants to just randomly stream alone
[58:11.710 --> 58:13.730]  or just start streaming on the regulation account,
[58:13.830 --> 58:15.730]  we don't really have a good slot for the VOD.
[58:16.830 --> 58:20.110]  And people seem to want it to watch later, but...
[58:21.450 --> 58:25.370]  It's like, do we just put it on Patreon and then we're just flooding Patreon with stuff?
[58:25.470 --> 58:26.410]  And then it's like, I just don't know.
[58:26.410 --> 58:28.570]  People don't like it when the Patreon is flooded.
[58:28.730 --> 58:31.430]  They already feel like it's too flooded, you know, and so...
[58:31.430 --> 58:34.590]  Yeah, and Utterly Chaotic totally agrees. That's why I get to 10 subs.
[58:35.030 --> 58:36.070]  Thank you so much, Utterly Chaotic.
[58:36.230 --> 58:41.650]  It is an interesting problem to solve that we don't have an easy solution for.
[58:41.710 --> 58:42.810]  We don't want to create new channels.
[58:42.810 --> 58:46.190]  No, we should not create new YouTube channels. That would be so unhealthy.
[58:46.350 --> 58:47.210]  But we don't want to...
[58:47.210 --> 58:54.950]  And also, like, to break the seal on that, I think you'll see us stream a lot more in that way.
[58:54.950 --> 58:55.990]  And a lot of that stuff...
[58:58.010 --> 59:01.310]  I just don't know that it has archive potential, you know?
[59:01.610 --> 59:04.670]  I mean, I've been really clear about, like, it's a...
[59:04.670 --> 59:06.310]  See it when you see it. We'll leave it on Twitch.
[59:06.370 --> 59:07.270]  And then when it's gone, it's gone.
[59:07.430 --> 59:11.290]  But I know that that's not a widely accepted thing.
[59:11.990 --> 59:13.550]  People don't like stuff to go away.
[59:13.750 --> 59:14.330]  What the fuck?
[59:14.950 --> 59:16.490]  What is supposed to happen here?
[59:16.910 --> 59:17.730]  Oh my god!
[59:17.770 --> 59:18.610]  Oh, I almost made it!
[59:18.630 --> 59:19.470]  Oh my god.
[59:19.750 --> 59:20.350]  Is that 16?
[59:20.530 --> 59:21.510]  That's crazy.
[59:22.290 --> 59:23.370]  Oh my god!
[59:27.210 --> 59:27.570]  Wow.
[59:28.930 --> 59:29.010]  Wow.
[59:29.010 --> 59:31.030]  Yeah, I think the opinion I want from the chat is...
[59:31.030 --> 59:35.390]  Is just a VOD left up on Twitch enough?
[59:36.050 --> 59:37.170]  But it goes away after 16.
[59:37.170 --> 59:38.290]  It goes after 16, yeah.
[59:39.070 --> 59:40.170]  It is still finite.
[59:41.510 --> 59:42.570]  Oh, I saw!
[59:42.710 --> 59:44.250]  I think you jumped a little early there.
[59:44.710 --> 59:45.250]  I thought you had it.
[59:46.370 --> 59:47.390]  Not that I guess you have...
[59:50.370 --> 59:51.590]  a hell of a lot of choice.
[59:51.730 --> 59:52.570]  That's 17, by the way.
[59:54.590 --> 59:55.030]  17.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.480]  Audience seems to say that they're okay with this.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.300]  There's 18.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.340]  Didn't even try that time.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.160]  I accidentally pushed it.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.380]  The vast majority of people are saying 60 days is more than enough.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:15.220]  Okay.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.800]  So maybe that's the answer.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.080]  That's what they say until day 61.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.180]  No, I don't think it...
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:19.560]  I mean...
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.600]  Zerby wants to know why not a stream archive channel?
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.820]  Because we have...
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.780]  We already have two YouTube channels.
[01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.960]  We don't need a third YouTube channel.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.920]  Sounds like...
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.380]  Sounds like we do.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.000]  I don't think we do.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.540]  Oh, what a move!
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.940]  I'd be fine with either.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.660]  I mean...
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.480]  If it means more casual streams, 60 days are good.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.840]  I think it would mean more casual.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.760]  Oh, way more casual.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.040]  The reason we don't do it is because we don't have anywhere to put it.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.200]  Oh, Par says they'll put it up on their YouTube channel.
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:53.640]  Oh, cool.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.080]  Where were you and we're having a meeting?
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:58.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:01.200]  Hey guys, it's 4.57.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.340]  Just FYI.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.320]  It means we're getting close.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.020]  And that means we're getting even closer to the Falcon event tonight at 8pm on our Discord.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.900]  And you can go to patreon.com slash regulationpod and become a Falcon.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.500]  And then join us for this Falcon event.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.040]  Gavin, make your best Falcon noise for the chat.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.140]  What channel and Discord?
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300]  It'll be on the stage.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.900]  It'll be on the live stage on Discord.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.280]  Yeah.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.540]  Do you have to stand on one end to like lift it?
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.060]  I assume so.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:37.960]  Do you have a seesaw?
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:38.520]  Yeah.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.940]  People just need to accept that some stuff is ephemeral.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.000]  Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, yeah, sure.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.600]  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.100]  Okay, sure.
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.160]  Yeah, I'll just let you know.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:50.480]  Jugs McTugs.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.900]  We agree with you.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.100]  Jugs McTugs is here, baby.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:54.740]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.480]  We totally agree with you on that, but...
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:56.560]  Yep.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.880]  You're at 20 deaths.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:00.880]  Oh my god.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:01.740]  Uh...
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.840]  Jeez, man.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.720]  Big Lawn Gnome said, man, Discord never been able to figure it out.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.100]  I use it only for work.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.080]  I use it for this and that's it.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.080]  Yeah.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.680]  What are you...
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]  I'm just saying, no way.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.080]  Is it like a back and forth Rocky situation?
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:24.460]  Okay.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:24.940]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.900]  It's gotta be more though, right?
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:27.980]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.480]  I actually tried to use Discord for other stuff like back when I was playing Gems of War pretty heavily.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:32.840]  Yeah.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.060]  There's a lot of...
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:37.520]  There's two Discord channels that have a lot of really important information for the game.
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.780]  And so I subscribed or whatever you did.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.960]  Whatever you do to, you know, joined them.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:42.460]  I think you gotta swing it.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:49.400]  And it was so fucking convoluted and hard to navigate and find information.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.240]  I hated it.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.340]  Yeah, it's just...
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.780]  What if a forum like moved in real time and it's like, oh my god, it's just too much.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.640]  Not wired that way.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.240]  Target Duck rated with a party of three.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.900]  What's up Target Duck and his two friends?
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.080]  Welcome to the stream.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.020]  Both of you.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.160]  Say hi to Jack the Blumpkin King and many others.
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.660]  Oh boy.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.340]  Yeah, here you go.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:16.620]  Here you go.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:16.960]  Here you go.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.280]  Here you go.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]  You got this right here, baby.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.340]  I think I was too late.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.060]  Yeah, you're too late.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:22.000]  This community loves you too, tiny bear.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:26.760]  Oh, here you go.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.160]  You got this.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:27.420]  Easy.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:28.580]  Easy peasy.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:29.780]  Right.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:31.700]  There you go.
[01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:36.170]  Gavin's almost beat the game, I think.
[01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:39.630]  Nice.
[01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:45.190]  What's good is I could test these long jumps and see if they're jumps or I have to do something
[01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.070]  before jumping.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:49.900]  Getting close.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.820]  Getting close to the old time of the week.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.120]  Yep.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.180]  Johnson Monster says, I rely on VOD.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.380]  Twitch is so inconvenient for me.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.300]  But Mark the Frog says I need to wash my truck.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.960]  So now what?
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.580]  Oh shit.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.330]  Oh, you're...
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.540]  Darkest Demon said Gavin's death count is old enough to drink now.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.320]  What do I need to swing with this?
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.260]  I don't know.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.380]  Maybe when you get higher here, you're supposed to swing with it.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.540]  You got to go over to like the left somewhere.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.960]  It doesn't seem right though.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.420]  Do I just need to leave it up here?
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:25.920]  Maybe.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.380]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.580]  Oh, Evil Reigns said they made the drink chug first.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:39.880]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:45.570]  5-1!
[01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:47.570]  We did it, boys.
[01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.530]  The best time of the week.
[01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.090]  It's quitting time, baby.
[01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.330]  Except for us, because we got Falcon event later tonight.
[01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.790]  We got work later, baby.
[01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.810]  We got to work in three short hours.
[01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.750]  Yeah, and honestly, I don't mind it.
[01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.970]  No, not at all.
[01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:03.150]  Yeah, it'll be fun.
[01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.570]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:04.290]  Looking forward to it.
[01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:05.170]  Really looking forward to it.
[01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.370]  A lot of arguing, if you're into that.
[01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.690]  Yeah, I have...
[01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:14.050]  It'll just be the three of us and we'll be voting on your suggestions for a summer's playlist.
[01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:16.750]  Which I'm excited about.
[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.510]  I think this will be good.
[01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.610]  It'll be on Discord.
[01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:21.450]  You and Gavin both submitted one song each already.
[01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:22.370]  Yeah, yeah, so far.
[01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:25.290]  And I think that can start us off as the three songs, if you decide.
[01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:28.030]  Maybe you can unveil your third, because we'll unveil our songs.
[01:05:28.290 --> 01:05:29.670]  And we'll start the playlist.
[01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.090]  And then there you go.
[01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:31.930]  Then I'll add mine.
[01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:32.230]  Yeah.
[01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.330]  There was a poll in the chat.
[01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:36.630]  Is random Twitch streams left on Twitch okay?
[01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.210]  No VOD.
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:38.890]  62% said yes.
[01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:45.070]  When I tell you that 62% of just people on Twitch is not a very big number for what we're doing here,
[01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:47.030]  that is an understatement.
[01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.070]  But it is good to see the sentiment.
[01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:52.310]  I appreciate it, because any feedback is good feedback here.
[01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:53.530]  Because we're just trying to figure it out.
[01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:54.750]  What was the feedback?
[01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:58.890]  62% said yes, it's good, just to leave it on Twitch.
[01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:03.910]  We also need to consider, especially the Patreon of it all, that a lot of our audience
[01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.250]  doesn't give a shit about video games.
[01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:07.550]  Nope, a lot of people don't.
[01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:07.750]  You know?
[01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:08.290]  Yep.
[01:06:08.570 --> 01:06:10.090]  And they don't want to see it clogged up.
[01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.210]  And I want to respect that, because we didn't start playing video games
[01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:17.230]  for this community until like five years in.
[01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.990]  You know what I mean?
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:20.010]  I don't want to do a switcheroo on the audience.
[01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.450]  No, but also, I don't want to prevent us from doing...
[01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:25.550]  What we want to do.
[01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.250]  Yeah, games and stuff.
[01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:27.550]  Yeah.
[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.070]  Because I want to stream more with you guys.
[01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:32.770]  And not even just with you guys, like me and Andrew.
[01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:36.810]  Or Nick decides to do the Last of Us stuff.
[01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:37.810]  Like that kind of stuff.
[01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:38.170]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.790]  All that MILF shit.
[01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.690]  Dude, I'm ready for him to do all that MILF shit.
[01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:43.930]  He won't stop talking about it.
[01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.530]  Nobody is more ready for the MILF stuff than Nick.
[01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:50.590]  He's ten toes down his throat on that.
[01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:51.810]  So it's like, it's crazy.
[01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:56.110]  Oh, Christ.
[01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.610]  Yeah.
[01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.090]  ChillyTurtle255 says,
[01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:01.870]  62% of the people who can watch the stream live don't mind if the volume is lost.
[01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:02.990]  Who the fuck cares?
[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:14.230]  I love the comment of the day.
[01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.550]  That is, that you really...
[01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:19.350]  SillyTurtle, for a first time chat, you came in with an old timer, bud.
[01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:20.350]  That was pretty good.
[01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:21.570]  That was a banger of a first comment.
[01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.070]  Yeah, you should be really happy with that one.
[01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:23.890]  That really got us.
[01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:24.670]  That was a good one, man.
[01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.050]  Well, guys, we'll be live.
[01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:30.270]  We'll be live on the Discord tonight at 8.
[01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:32.890]  Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:36.330]  If you want to join, become a falcon and then check that out.
[01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.310]  And if you're a falcon and you can't make it,
[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:41.350]  that's OK because we put a VOD of it up on Patreon later.
[01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:46.070]  We're going to go until Gavin dies, which I can't imagine is going to be very soon.
[01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.930]  So I think he's really got this year.
[01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:50.410]  Seems like real now-ish.
[01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:52.210]  Do I need to have one on top of the other?
[01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.490]  You better.
[01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:52.830]  Probably.
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.330]  What's the plan?
[01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:56.950]  What's the plan?
[01:07:58.110 --> 01:07:58.470]  22.
[01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:59.890]  To go till Gavin dies?
[01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:00.370]  22.
[01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:02.510]  Thanks for watching, everyone.
[01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:04.070]  It's been a lovely stream.
[01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:07.390]  And I hope the next time I'll get slightly further because my memory...
[01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:11.990]  OK, we'll see you next time.
[01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.550]  Bye.
[01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.890]  Bye.
