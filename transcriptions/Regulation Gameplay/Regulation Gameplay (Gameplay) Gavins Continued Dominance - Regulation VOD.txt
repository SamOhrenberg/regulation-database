[00:00.000 --> 00:02.440]  What color should my mohawk be?
[00:02.760 --> 00:03.160]  Purple!
[00:03.660 --> 00:05.280]  How do you change your mohawk color?
[00:05.720 --> 00:06.380]  You have to unlock it.
[00:06.380 --> 00:07.660]  Up here by the wardrobe.
[00:08.340 --> 00:10.580]  Oh yeah, and you do have to unlock stuff. I see, I see.
[00:10.580 --> 00:11.420]  I might as well just show everyone the game.
[00:11.460 --> 00:13.320]  Hey guys, what's up? We're playing, uh...
[00:13.320 --> 00:15.360]  more of, uh, what is it? Animal Planet?
[00:15.360 --> 00:16.580]  Ultimate Chicken Horse.
[00:17.220 --> 00:18.100]  Ultimate Chicken Horse.
[00:18.680 --> 00:19.600]  Super Animal Planet.
[00:19.940 --> 00:20.880]  Super Animal Planet.
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.740]  It's myself, it's Gavin, it's Geoff, and it's Andrew.
[00:25.080 --> 00:27.860]  Andrew cannot get in the lobby because there's two Gavins.
[00:27.880 --> 00:28.900]  No, I'm here. He's here.
[00:28.900 --> 00:30.800]  So wait, so there are just two Gavins?
[00:31.700 --> 00:31.980]  Nope.
[00:32.300 --> 00:33.480]  I'm a little floppy ears over here.
[00:33.660 --> 00:35.100]  Oh, it is weird. I do too, yeah.
[00:35.200 --> 00:38.280]  I see a monkey Gavin and a bird Gavin.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.160]  Yeah, I only see bird Gavin.
[00:40.460 --> 00:42.840]  Yeah, I'm standing next to a Gav.
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.300]  Well, the monkey is a filthy imposter. I don't trust anything he says.
[00:47.460 --> 00:47.860]  Oh, okay, cool.
[00:47.860 --> 00:51.060]  Okay, so the real Gavin has a purple mohawk.
[00:51.540 --> 00:51.940]  Cool.
[00:51.980 --> 00:52.560]  That's correct.
[00:52.960 --> 00:53.740]  Well, that's great.
[00:53.760 --> 00:54.340]  What map do you want to play?
[00:55.500 --> 00:56.140]  What are we playing?
[00:56.500 --> 00:58.260]  Let's vote on some shite.
[00:59.200 --> 01:00.700]  Happy Friday, by the way.
[01:00.960 --> 01:02.520]  I'm making sure this is running so we're good to go.
[01:03.260 --> 01:04.140]  Happy Friday.
[01:05.020 --> 01:06.220]  Happy Friday, everyone.
[01:06.460 --> 01:09.920]  Happy Friday to the regulation crew. Happy Friday to the audience, the regulation audience.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.360]  Happy to be here.
[01:12.000 --> 01:12.600]  I am too.
[01:12.660 --> 01:13.420]  Oh, we're starting in five?
[01:13.600 --> 01:14.580]  Regulation chickies.
[01:14.920 --> 01:16.120]  This was a fun week, wild week.
[01:16.320 --> 01:16.940]  I picked the mainframe.
[01:17.200 --> 01:17.240]  One.
[01:18.360 --> 01:19.260]  Oh, the mainframe.
[01:20.060 --> 01:20.420]  Let's see.
[01:20.480 --> 01:21.380]  Is where we're going.
[01:21.780 --> 01:22.220]  Mainframe!
[01:22.460 --> 01:22.640]  Volcano.
[01:22.640 --> 01:23.560]  What was the mainframe, guys?
[01:24.980 --> 01:26.780]  This is the overheated mainframe.
[01:27.280 --> 01:27.700]  Wait, what?
[01:27.700 --> 01:28.120]  This is the volcano.
[01:28.680 --> 01:29.000]  Yeah.
[01:29.100 --> 01:30.340]  This doesn't look anything like a mainframe.
[01:31.640 --> 01:31.900]  Now what?
[01:32.100 --> 01:33.520]  Did you actually think it went to mainframe?
[01:33.640 --> 01:33.960]  Yeah!
[01:34.320 --> 01:35.760]  It looked like it was going.
[01:35.860 --> 01:36.400]  I was excited.
[01:38.680 --> 01:39.240]  You know what?
[01:39.320 --> 01:40.840]  I'm going to put that right here.
[01:41.000 --> 01:42.080]  I feel good about my placement.
[01:42.260 --> 01:43.160]  We're just trying to get somewhere.
[01:43.300 --> 01:44.180]  We're trying to get things going.
[01:44.900 --> 01:45.360]  Easy peasy.
[01:46.580 --> 01:47.700]  I like the...
[01:48.880 --> 01:49.260]  Okay.
[01:50.300 --> 01:50.700]  Oh!
[01:51.740 --> 01:54.380]  Wow, this might be poised just for nothing.
[01:54.940 --> 01:55.880]  Wow, wow, wow.
[01:55.980 --> 01:56.940]  Looking good, feeling good.
[01:57.840 --> 01:58.860]  Is Y sprint?
[01:59.400 --> 01:59.560]  Jump.
[02:00.100 --> 02:00.600]  What button sprint?
[02:01.520 --> 02:02.240]  X, okay.
[02:02.280 --> 02:03.080]  It's just like Mario.
[02:03.300 --> 02:05.440]  That's what I couldn't remember was what was run.
[02:05.660 --> 02:07.700]  And that's why I did this and I did like...
[02:08.260 --> 02:09.720]  Right trigger is also run.
[02:10.480 --> 02:11.460]  Oh, thank you.
[02:12.120 --> 02:12.660]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:12.920 --> 02:14.300]  And E is run as well.
[02:14.580 --> 02:15.540]  Hey, there's water right there.
[02:15.980 --> 02:16.240]  Whoa!
[02:16.480 --> 02:17.560]  Did not realize there was water.
[02:17.560 --> 02:18.000]  Got him!
[02:18.280 --> 02:19.160]  I got him!
[02:19.920 --> 02:22.960]  That should count as a trap, but it won't because it's not really a trap, but...
[02:22.960 --> 02:23.160]  Yep.
[02:23.580 --> 02:24.020]  No!
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.580]  That sucks, dude.
[02:25.580 --> 02:25.840]  Really?
[02:25.840 --> 02:29.540]  That was the point of it.
[02:29.700 --> 02:29.940]  It wouldn't be a trap.
[02:30.740 --> 02:31.740]  Oh, Reznor, look at that.
[02:32.040 --> 02:32.860]  I just killed you.
[02:32.960 --> 02:34.500]  I feel like that makes it a trap.
[02:34.720 --> 02:35.820]  It's not like a death trap.
[02:35.840 --> 02:37.600]  It's more of a inconvenience.
[02:37.700 --> 02:38.860]  I just...
[02:38.860 --> 02:39.840]  Well, I just killed him.
[02:40.040 --> 02:40.500]  So I don't...
[02:40.500 --> 02:41.580]  Is it not a death trap?
[02:41.660 --> 02:43.060]  It literally was his cause of death.
[02:43.060 --> 02:45.100]  I'm not sure who you're arguing with.
[02:46.260 --> 02:47.740]  Just the world in general.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.620]  Not anyone here.
[02:48.940 --> 02:53.660]  I like that someone placed a spike ball on your Reznor and then you moved it.
[02:53.760 --> 02:54.500]  And then you moved it.
[02:55.140 --> 02:57.620]  I put it down and I went, feel good about that.
[02:57.960 --> 02:58.480]  That happened.
[02:58.840 --> 02:59.500]  I made the jump.
[03:00.160 --> 03:01.080]  Good job, buddy.
[03:01.620 --> 03:02.000]  Thanks.
[03:02.220 --> 03:03.380]  It's progress for me.
[03:03.540 --> 03:05.220]  Oh, we don't have the collision on.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.940]  I can turn on bunsing for the next round if you miss the bunsing.
[03:09.120 --> 03:09.920]  Definitely need it.
[03:10.160 --> 03:11.480]  Yeah, we definitely need it.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.000]  We'll do.
[03:13.160 --> 03:14.000]  I did it.
[03:14.160 --> 03:14.940]  Raccoon's in, baby.
[03:14.940 --> 03:15.160]  No.
[03:15.440 --> 03:15.560]  No.
[03:15.760 --> 03:15.920]  No.
[03:16.100 --> 03:16.240]  No.
[03:16.600 --> 03:18.000]  Raccoon is in, baby.
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.080]  How's everyone in the chat?
[03:21.460 --> 03:23.620]  Can I get some piss rats in the chat?
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.600]  Oh, that's right.
[03:26.640 --> 03:29.340]  We got to get some emotes going because now you guys can subscribe.
[03:29.440 --> 03:30.540]  Thank you if you have subscribed.
[03:30.660 --> 03:31.760]  Really appreciate you so much.
[03:31.960 --> 03:32.520]  Thank you so much.
[03:32.540 --> 03:34.920]  How do we get an emote of a rat covered in piss?
[03:35.300 --> 03:37.020]  Well, I think that would get us banned, maybe.
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.580]  Yeah, I think we did.
[03:38.760 --> 03:40.440]  Now it's just everyone saying piss rat.
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.620]  I definitely think that should probably...
[03:42.620 --> 03:43.640]  I'm going to ban that term.
[03:43.740 --> 03:44.460]  Don't worry about it.
[03:44.580 --> 03:46.240]  There's no way you can ban it.
[03:47.080 --> 03:49.020]  We'll have to vote on whether that's banned or not.
[03:49.580 --> 03:50.200]  Too easy.
[03:50.280 --> 03:50.820]  No points.
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.020]  No.
[03:53.620 --> 03:55.260]  Last week, we were all about democracy.
[03:55.460 --> 03:56.600]  This week, we don't give a fuck.
[03:56.980 --> 03:58.700]  Yeah, that's pretty true.
[04:00.080 --> 04:01.640]  Last week, it was all democracy in the chat.
[04:01.760 --> 04:02.420]  This week, I don't give a fuck.
[04:02.440 --> 04:03.220]  Yep, yep.
[04:03.440 --> 04:04.160]  It's just me, baby.
[04:06.220 --> 04:06.860]  Have fun with that.
[04:06.920 --> 04:08.140]  Oh, my God, Andrew.
[04:09.340 --> 04:09.900]  Andrew's making...
[04:09.900 --> 04:11.380]  I want some fire, some water.
[04:11.500 --> 04:12.000]  Let's mix it up.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.160]  That looks like a home alone trap, Andrew made.
[04:14.560 --> 04:16.480]  What the fuck is up with this flower?
[04:17.400 --> 04:18.040]  What do you mean?
[04:18.620 --> 04:19.680]  It's not going up and down.
[04:19.740 --> 04:20.620]  It simply is.
[04:21.280 --> 04:22.140]  Did you put it there?
[04:22.560 --> 04:22.960]  No.
[04:23.320 --> 04:24.540]  What did I die of?
[04:25.060 --> 04:26.540]  You got punched by the flower.
[04:27.320 --> 04:28.220]  I hate that flower.
[04:28.520 --> 04:30.040]  The thing we were talking about.
[04:30.360 --> 04:33.360]  What a great placement for the flower.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.380]  Oh, man.
[04:40.880 --> 04:43.580]  I put the flower there. Where's all my points?
[04:44.260 --> 04:45.140]  No one made it.
[04:45.560 --> 04:46.780]  Yeah, that has to be a...
[04:46.780 --> 04:47.840]  Do we both get the coin?
[04:48.420 --> 04:49.920]  I think we maybe double-coined it.
[04:49.920 --> 04:50.980]  Oh, son of a...
[04:50.980 --> 04:52.500]  Son of an arse.
[04:52.900 --> 04:54.140]  Here, there we go.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.620]  Coin on the flower's head.
[04:57.480 --> 04:58.740]  I feel good about it.
[04:59.600 --> 04:59.860]  A what?
[05:00.060 --> 05:00.280]  Coin!
[05:00.500 --> 05:00.820]  Wow!
[05:01.300 --> 05:01.500]  Coin!
[05:02.040 --> 05:02.460]  No!
[05:02.660 --> 05:02.900]  No!
[05:03.100 --> 05:03.380]  No!
[05:03.840 --> 05:04.640]  I got shot!
[05:06.060 --> 05:07.960]  No, not the fucking tree!
[05:08.420 --> 05:10.400]  Fucking shrook it.
[05:10.740 --> 05:11.620]  Oh, my God.
[05:13.820 --> 05:14.740]  Get him, get him!
[05:15.240 --> 05:16.260]  Oh, you got whammed!
[05:16.280 --> 05:16.820]  How did that get...
[05:16.820 --> 05:19.220]  Oh, come on!
[05:19.220 --> 05:19.560]  Boo!
[05:20.540 --> 05:21.180]  Get him!
[05:21.580 --> 05:22.120]  Get him!
[05:22.360 --> 05:23.000]  Oh, come on!
[05:23.000 --> 05:23.880]  It's right at the end!
[05:24.040 --> 05:24.480]  Oh, wow.
[05:25.180 --> 05:25.660]  Boo!
[05:27.960 --> 05:29.360]  Oh, my God.
[05:29.600 --> 05:30.620]  Oh, my God!
[05:30.980 --> 05:31.320]  Oh, fuck!
[05:31.840 --> 05:32.800]  Holy shit!
[05:33.340 --> 05:33.880]  Jesus Christ!
[05:34.700 --> 05:37.020]  This game's a completely different game without Michael in it.
[05:37.220 --> 05:37.580]  Yes.
[05:37.920 --> 05:41.200]  That is all of the comments in the video that we put up.
[05:41.300 --> 05:42.080]  It's just people going,
[05:42.220 --> 05:43.920]  I guess Gavin wins when Michael's not here.
[05:43.980 --> 05:44.600]  That's interesting.
[05:45.360 --> 05:47.440]  Was I decent at video games this whole time?
[05:47.600 --> 05:48.000]  No.
[05:49.420 --> 05:52.120]  You might have been, but you have no idea.
[05:54.060 --> 05:54.820]  That's fucking great.
[05:54.820 --> 05:57.020]  I like the double wrecking ball Reznor.
[05:57.320 --> 05:57.920]  Mm-hmm.
[06:00.720 --> 06:01.540]  Oh, shit!
[06:01.680 --> 06:02.120]  I thought...
[06:02.120 --> 06:03.240]  What happened, bud?
[06:03.240 --> 06:04.520]  How do we do over there?
[06:04.700 --> 06:05.480]  This is terrible.
[06:07.300 --> 06:07.820]  Oh!
[06:08.280 --> 06:08.660]  Ah!
[06:08.980 --> 06:09.260]  Whoa!
[06:09.460 --> 06:10.700]  God damn it!
[06:10.700 --> 06:11.300]  You got whammed.
[06:11.560 --> 06:12.200]  Gavin wins.
[06:12.360 --> 06:13.500]  God damn you, Gavin!
[06:13.800 --> 06:14.120]  Boo!
[06:16.560 --> 06:18.020]  This map and game suck.
[06:20.660 --> 06:22.900]  This is why we should have gone to the Matrix or whatever I picked.
[06:25.480 --> 06:26.260]  We can do it.
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.260]  Oh, I get an achievement.
[06:27.660 --> 06:32.960]  If you want me to play the rest of the stream with a real smug face, I can put on a handicap for you.
[06:33.100 --> 06:34.000]  No, no, no.
[06:34.160 --> 06:34.640]  Do one of these.
[06:34.820 --> 06:35.520]  Just play straight.
[06:35.760 --> 06:36.880]  Play straight and go to hell.
[06:37.420 --> 06:37.640]  No, no, no.
[06:37.780 --> 06:38.400]  No, no, no.
[06:38.540 --> 06:41.480]  Just go ahead and go 100% and fuck yourself.
[06:42.020 --> 06:42.240]  Yeah.
[06:42.260 --> 06:42.580]  Okay.
[06:42.900 --> 06:43.400]  I'll do it.
[06:43.480 --> 06:45.200]  I'll keep playing hard.
[06:45.260 --> 06:46.000]  I'll keep playing to win.
[06:46.860 --> 06:48.280]  What's up with the old mansion here?
[06:49.280 --> 06:51.020]  You act like you don't always play to win.
[06:51.180 --> 06:52.400]  Usually I'm trying to be entertaining.
[06:52.560 --> 06:54.380]  I'm usually trying to win.
[06:55.960 --> 06:57.240]  Oh yeah, I need to turn on buncing.
[06:57.340 --> 06:57.600]  Hold on.
[06:57.820 --> 06:58.420]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:58.740 --> 06:59.400]  Nobody pick yet.

[07:33.940 --> 07:34.180]  God damn it.
[07:34.960 --> 07:36.260]  What does this one do that's special?
[07:38.520 --> 07:39.920]  Do we need to like...
[07:39.920 --> 07:41.160]  Are we like trying to work together here?
[07:41.300 --> 07:41.780]  What's going on?
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.600]  What map is this?
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.000]  I don't know.
[07:44.000 --> 07:44.300]  Empty?
[07:44.340 --> 07:44.640]  I don't know.
[07:44.640 --> 07:46.500]  Oh, is this the dance party one?
[07:47.380 --> 07:48.280]  I don't know.
[07:48.780 --> 07:49.500]  Oh, this one sucks.
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.820]  Oh, what is this?
[07:53.260 --> 07:54.840]  This one's so hard to follow.
[07:55.040 --> 07:55.420]  Oh, good.
[07:55.480 --> 07:56.600]  Oh, fuck.
[07:56.740 --> 08:00.180]  We turned on running into each other for this one.
[08:01.020 --> 08:02.060]  Get off of me.
[08:03.040 --> 08:04.240]  Get off of me.
[08:04.560 --> 08:04.780]  Whoops.
[08:08.020 --> 08:09.180]  This is great.
[08:09.980 --> 08:10.500]  No, you dick.
[08:10.620 --> 08:11.520]  Oh my God.
[08:12.640 --> 08:13.500]  What happened?
[08:14.640 --> 08:16.180]  I didn't realize it was sticky.
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.080]  Yeah, that's why I fell.
[08:18.200 --> 08:18.900]  I got stuck in the glue.
[08:18.900 --> 08:20.260]  I did not know it was sticky.
[08:21.100 --> 08:22.940]  Andrew has a handy towel.
[08:23.340 --> 08:23.560]  You idiot.
[08:23.560 --> 08:24.100]  Why'd you do that?
[08:24.580 --> 08:25.540]  You idiot.
[08:26.460 --> 08:27.260]  You've done it again.
[08:27.380 --> 08:28.280]  You do it every time.
[08:28.480 --> 08:30.960]  I was trying to push you away from the...
[08:30.960 --> 08:33.360]  There wasn't buncing in the lobby yet, I don't think.
[08:34.000 --> 08:34.740]  Is there not?
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.580]  I was trying to bunce you into...
[08:36.580 --> 08:36.780]  So dumb.
[08:39.020 --> 08:39.420]  Okay.
[08:40.180 --> 08:40.980]  You fool.
[08:42.500 --> 08:43.560]  What do I want to do here?
[08:45.020 --> 08:45.540]  Oh.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.400]  Gotten his jump.
[08:49.840 --> 08:49.940]  Okay.
[08:50.780 --> 08:51.480]  What's the...
[08:52.700 --> 08:53.220]  No!
[08:55.780 --> 08:58.380]  Hey, raccoon.
[08:58.440 --> 08:59.460]  You got it, Eric.
[08:59.540 --> 09:00.020]  There we go.
[09:01.680 --> 09:02.200]  No!
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.220]  There you go.
[09:03.240 --> 09:03.540]  There we go.
[09:03.940 --> 09:04.220]  All right.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.180]  Daddy's home.
[09:06.140 --> 09:06.920]  Boom, baby!
[09:07.220 --> 09:07.740]  Raccoon time!
[09:07.760 --> 09:08.160]  Nice!
[09:08.240 --> 09:08.800]  Good job, Eric.
[09:09.400 --> 09:10.260]  That's right, Eric.
[09:10.260 --> 09:10.940]  He's the king.
[09:11.420 --> 09:12.440]  How do I time this?
[09:12.440 --> 09:13.160]  Oh, goodness.
[09:13.680 --> 09:14.460]  Daddy's home.
[09:14.700 --> 09:15.740]  No, I fucked up!
[09:15.900 --> 09:16.280]  Oh, I'm okay.
[09:17.100 --> 09:20.860]  So, I put that down there because I figured I was going to fuck it all up.
[09:21.380 --> 09:22.140]  Saved your ass.
[09:22.980 --> 09:24.220]  Careful of the goo, though.
[09:25.400 --> 09:25.820]  Oh, wow.
[09:26.080 --> 09:27.040]  Oh, why did I do that?
[09:27.140 --> 09:28.200]  Oh, Geoff!
[09:28.360 --> 09:28.660]  Why?
[09:29.140 --> 09:31.160]  You got excited and just started pressing buttons.
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.700]  Points for the raccoon!
[09:34.140 --> 09:35.860]  I hate myself!
[09:38.140 --> 09:39.460]  God damn, Geoff!
[09:40.580 --> 09:41.620]  You had the world.
[09:41.620 --> 09:42.760]  You had it, buddy.
[09:42.760 --> 09:43.320]  Fucking dumb!
[09:44.860 --> 09:45.460]  Fuck!
[09:47.140 --> 09:48.520]  Man, fuck that guy.
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.320]  Well, all right.
[09:51.620 --> 09:54.000]  Dude, hockey puck, crazy style.
[09:55.340 --> 09:56.540]  You ass!
[09:56.920 --> 09:57.520]  No!
[09:58.540 --> 09:59.840]  You suck shit.
[10:01.060 --> 10:02.220]  You're a shit sucker.
[10:02.380 --> 10:02.780]  Son of a bitch.
[10:03.540 --> 10:05.600]  Everybody hit the fucking desk.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.940]  Oh, it's gonna...
[10:08.360 --> 10:09.420]  Oh, god damn it!
[10:09.420 --> 10:11.660]  I thought the sticky was gonna grab me.
[10:11.700 --> 10:12.840]  I thought I was gonna hold it there.
[10:13.980 --> 10:15.820]  All right, go, Andrew, go!
[10:16.520 --> 10:16.920]  No!
[10:17.460 --> 10:19.280]  You really tied the needle on that one, buddy.
[10:19.600 --> 10:20.360]  You dunce.
[10:24.560 --> 10:25.800]  This is a nightmare.
[10:26.560 --> 10:28.460]  The dance party is an absolute nightmare.
[10:28.720 --> 10:31.520]  Yeah, we never played it for videos because it's so ugly.
[10:33.040 --> 10:33.780]  Oh, man.
[10:35.220 --> 10:37.500]  I like it because you're bad at it.
[10:37.600 --> 10:38.200]  Uh, yeah.
[10:39.280 --> 10:41.560]  Maybe that's why I tried to steer people away.
[10:44.140 --> 10:44.800]  See ya!
[10:45.440 --> 10:46.220]  Oh, the thing!
[10:48.180 --> 10:49.940]  That was so close, Gavin.
[10:50.880 --> 10:51.780]  What am I doing?
[10:53.480 --> 10:54.860]  I'm sucking my essence.
[10:57.040 --> 10:58.160]  Oh, no, it's sticky.
[10:58.980 --> 10:59.160]  Yeah.
[10:59.660 --> 11:00.780]  Oh, no, the spike!
[11:01.100 --> 11:02.840]  The spike, I forgot about the spike.
[11:03.960 --> 11:04.760]  No, the puck!
[11:04.840 --> 11:05.580]  I thought it was the puck!
[11:05.580 --> 11:08.580]  I got fucking slapped!
[11:09.760 --> 11:10.420]  God damn!
[11:10.420 --> 11:11.740]  How did you make it?
[11:12.780 --> 11:13.800]  I just went, you know?
[11:14.300 --> 11:15.300]  Had a meeting over there.
[11:15.640 --> 11:16.980]  I'm an on-time kind of guy.
[11:21.060 --> 11:22.360]  Don't worry, I'll get it.
[11:31.960 --> 11:33.940]  What are you doing?
[11:35.180 --> 11:36.380]  I ran off the edge!
[11:36.560 --> 11:37.400]  I ran off the edge!
[11:37.540 --> 11:38.160]  Oh, my God.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.000]  Are you back?
[11:41.420 --> 11:41.700]  Yeah.
[11:42.320 --> 11:44.640]  I can't get over there because everyone's in a line!
[11:46.140 --> 11:46.940]  Well, yeah, wait in line.
[11:47.220 --> 11:47.980]  Shit, I'm waiting my turn.
[11:48.220 --> 11:48.800]  Shit-ass.
[11:49.220 --> 11:49.560]  Wait, what happened?
[11:49.560 --> 11:50.720]  I think Geoff and I are waiting our turns.
[11:53.480 --> 11:54.360]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[11:54.500 --> 11:54.840]  Thank you.
[11:59.450 --> 12:00.590]  Oh, I can't see.
[12:01.590 --> 12:01.870]  Nope.
[12:02.830 --> 12:04.690]  Oh, I hit the spikes, I couldn't see.
[12:04.770 --> 12:05.350]  No, Geoff!
[12:05.750 --> 12:06.990]  Why did you go back?
[12:10.050 --> 12:13.010]  I waited my turn in line and you went back!
[12:14.310 --> 12:16.490]  Because I was flailing.
[12:16.730 --> 12:16.930]  Coin!
[12:18.050 --> 12:18.410]  Duh.
[12:18.890 --> 12:19.490]  All right.
[12:20.490 --> 12:22.850]  Let's see who really wants it.
[12:23.770 --> 12:24.010]  Yeah.
[12:28.850 --> 12:29.930]  Oh, my God.
[12:30.090 --> 12:30.450]  What?
[12:30.730 --> 12:32.530]  Let's see who really wants it.
[12:33.810 --> 12:34.890]  Andrew, you maniac.
[12:35.270 --> 12:35.990]  All right, Gavin's first.
[12:36.850 --> 12:38.030]  Okay, watch this, guys.
[12:38.030 --> 12:39.530]  Stop shoving me!
[12:39.750 --> 12:40.590]  You're killing me!
[12:40.810 --> 12:41.690]  You're killing me!
[12:42.410 --> 12:42.890]  Push him.
[12:43.550 --> 12:45.070]  Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[12:45.370 --> 12:46.190]  Oh, Geoff!
[12:47.790 --> 12:49.310]  Hoisted by his own petard.
[12:50.890 --> 12:52.170]  Oh, the spike ball!
[12:52.170 --> 12:54.190]  Eric refusing to remember the spike.
[12:54.550 --> 12:55.570]  I forgot the spike ball.
[12:55.570 --> 12:56.670]  Captain Petard is...
[12:56.670 --> 12:58.010]  Where is it?!
[12:58.010 --> 13:00.690]  There's nothing there, you fool!
[13:09.530 --> 13:10.870]  Somebody said, is there Geoff audio?
[13:11.010 --> 13:11.770]  Are you guys not hearing me?
[13:12.270 --> 13:13.490]  I hear you just fine.
[13:13.570 --> 13:14.790]  Can everyone hear Geoff in the chat?
[13:15.150 --> 13:15.890]  Geoff, there's...
[13:15.890 --> 13:16.770]  I think it's...
[13:16.770 --> 13:20.190]  There's one person who said that, but no one else has said anything about it.
[13:20.350 --> 13:20.750]  Okay.
[13:21.290 --> 13:23.810]  Because I can get a lot louder!
[13:24.470 --> 13:26.350]  I think maybe you don't need to read the chat.
[13:27.330 --> 13:27.730]  Oh.
[13:27.930 --> 13:28.290]  Okay.
[13:35.540 --> 13:36.180]  See ya!
[13:37.700 --> 13:38.360]  Oh, my God.
[13:38.380 --> 13:39.040]  That kind of worked.
[13:39.240 --> 13:39.580]  I died.
[13:41.740 --> 13:43.480]  Oh, there's a coin?!
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.220]  Yeah!
[13:44.580 --> 13:46.260]  Who snuck a coin?
[13:46.540 --> 13:46.780]  Me!
[13:46.940 --> 13:47.960]  I wanted to see who wanted it!
[13:48.800 --> 13:49.820]  Everyone wants it.
[13:50.040 --> 13:51.360]  We can't stop looking at it.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.020]  Way to go, Andrew.
[13:53.800 --> 13:54.220]  Come on, Geoff!
[13:54.320 --> 13:54.680]  No!
[13:55.340 --> 13:56.240]  You piece of shit!
[13:56.240 --> 13:56.860]  That was you!
[13:56.960 --> 13:57.940]  You pushed me!
[13:58.800 --> 13:59.960]  And I was at the top!
[14:00.060 --> 14:00.940]  How did I push?
[14:01.360 --> 14:04.680]  Geoff didn't have a fucking chance.
[14:07.100 --> 14:08.460]  Zero chance on that one.
[14:08.460 --> 14:10.640]  This is the slowest round ever!
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.440]  Oh, man.
[14:15.620 --> 14:16.740]  What does this do?
[14:21.960 --> 14:22.960]  Oh, who's...
[14:22.960 --> 14:23.560]  Oh!
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.120]  My contraption!
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.700]  Oh, look at him going for the coin!
[14:31.860 --> 14:32.240]  Boo!
[14:34.020 --> 14:34.880]  Single use.
[14:35.420 --> 14:36.360]  What is that?
[14:36.420 --> 14:37.160]  What am I on?
[14:37.640 --> 14:38.880]  It was glued?!
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.200]  Oh!
[14:41.920 --> 14:43.440]  What is it?
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.400]  See you later, losers.
[14:46.480 --> 14:47.740]  I don't know what it is!
[14:48.960 --> 14:49.920]  Alright, yeah, alright.
[14:49.940 --> 14:50.740]  See you later, Andrew.
[14:51.640 --> 14:51.940]  No!
[14:52.240 --> 14:52.420]  No!
[14:56.240 --> 14:57.840]  See you later, losers.
[14:58.100 --> 14:59.600]  Straight into a wall.
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.200]  I went behind where I said that.
[15:05.360 --> 15:08.600]  I died before the declaration point.
[15:08.880 --> 15:10.760]  Hey, Andrew, can you blow this shitty thing up?
[15:12.140 --> 15:12.980]  Uh, no.
[15:13.240 --> 15:14.000]  Oh, okay.
[15:14.400 --> 15:14.680]  Alright.
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.040]  Oh, you just wasted the bomb?
[15:18.100 --> 15:19.060]  You don't want anything to do with it?
[15:19.060 --> 15:19.420]  Yeah.
[15:19.820 --> 15:21.740]  No, I think this is a masterpiece as is.
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.200]  Oh, shit.
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.260]  Jesus alive.
[15:30.800 --> 15:31.960]  I don't know what's going on here.
[15:32.780 --> 15:34.060]  Alright, well, I guess let's head out.
[15:34.420 --> 15:35.000]  See what happens.
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.540]  You got fucking fried, bud.
[15:38.540 --> 15:39.580]  I got torched.
[15:40.920 --> 15:42.100]  What's going on?
[15:43.700 --> 15:44.460]  Andrew, go!
[15:44.820 --> 15:46.320]  My body's died in it.
[15:46.480 --> 15:47.220]  I don't...
[15:47.220 --> 15:47.900]  I'm trying!
[15:48.140 --> 15:49.120]  His body's blocking it!
[15:49.140 --> 15:49.460]  Oops, I'm dead.
[15:49.540 --> 15:50.200]  It's blocking!
[15:50.340 --> 15:51.860]  You blocked it with his body!
[15:51.980 --> 15:52.260]  Go!
[15:53.180 --> 15:54.220]  Gotta go up and over.
[15:54.720 --> 15:55.060]  Go, Andrew!
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.200]  I died in the fry hole.
[15:56.400 --> 15:56.920]  I'm trying!
[15:57.420 --> 15:58.240]  Andrew, go!
[15:59.040 --> 16:00.160]  It won't let me!
[16:00.380 --> 16:00.860]  Andrew!
[16:01.100 --> 16:01.580]  You go!
[16:01.860 --> 16:02.420]  You go!
[16:02.660 --> 16:03.360]  You go!
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.340]  Eric, go!
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.240]  Oh, there we go!
[16:07.420 --> 16:07.940]  Good push!
[16:08.540 --> 16:09.820]  Good team push!
[16:10.900 --> 16:12.160]  It was like a rugby push!
[16:13.020 --> 16:14.960]  I'm more effective dead, I think, than alive.
[16:15.420 --> 16:16.220]  Oh, he's gonna make it!
[16:16.520 --> 16:17.340]  No, he's not!
[16:17.640 --> 16:18.940]  He got too excited.
[16:19.180 --> 16:20.260]  He started pressing buttons.
[16:20.960 --> 16:23.640]  You said I'm gonna make it, and then pulled panic.
[16:24.000 --> 16:24.420]  Full panic.
[16:25.360 --> 16:26.200]  Pulled panic.
[16:26.720 --> 16:27.860]  Three turns left.
[16:27.960 --> 16:28.640]  Oh my god.
[16:29.040 --> 16:29.540]  Oh, goodness.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.820]  Look at this box full of shit.
[16:40.120 --> 16:43.020]  Gavin, how are you not using it on this fucking thing over here?
[16:43.140 --> 16:43.600]  You're crazy.
[16:43.740 --> 16:43.940]  What thing?
[16:44.520 --> 16:47.980]  The fucking, the contraption that you asked Andrew to blow up earlier!
[16:48.380 --> 16:51.520]  Cause he's gonna put his fricking Tetris block right where I blew it up!
[16:51.660 --> 16:52.500]  Can you not see him?
[16:54.440 --> 16:55.160]  I'm waiting.
[16:58.960 --> 16:59.660]  Go on, place it.
[16:59.780 --> 17:00.080]  I dare you.
[17:00.520 --> 17:01.100]  I dare you, little son.
[17:01.180 --> 17:01.480]  I dare you.
[17:02.260 --> 17:02.840]  I dare you.
[17:05.340 --> 17:05.700]  Shit!
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.040]  It's even worse now.
[17:10.340 --> 17:11.420]  Yes, it is.
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.820]  Oh, it doesn't work at all.
[17:14.060 --> 17:15.740]  It works again!
[17:16.740 --> 17:17.060]  No!
[17:19.000 --> 17:19.800]  Oh no!
[17:21.020 --> 17:21.740]  I'm alive.
[17:22.080 --> 17:23.280]  No, Eric, stop buzzing me!
[17:23.580 --> 17:24.220]  No, God damn it!
[17:24.220 --> 17:24.840]  What is happening?
[17:25.940 --> 17:26.420]  No!
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.760]  Oh, it's sticky.
[17:29.080 --> 17:30.220]  Oh, fuck, it's sticky.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.420]  Oh, it's so sticky!
[17:33.660 --> 17:34.140]  Stop!
[17:34.480 --> 17:35.060]  It's sticky!
[17:35.860 --> 17:36.500]  You gotta de-stick.
[17:39.360 --> 17:40.380]  Oh, look at him.
[17:40.740 --> 17:41.620]  You definitely have.
[17:41.780 --> 17:41.980]  No!
[17:42.840 --> 17:43.360]  No!
[17:44.240 --> 17:46.400]  I forgot there was a black hole!
[17:46.660 --> 17:48.920]  I'm like, oh wow, I think I can make this free and clear.
[17:50.720 --> 17:52.760]  I got arrowed and black holed.
[17:53.180 --> 17:54.000]  Two turns left.
[17:56.040 --> 17:57.020]  Oh, shit.
[17:57.180 --> 17:58.120]  Oh, my God.
[17:58.440 --> 17:59.280]  Oh, shit.
[18:11.070 --> 18:12.850]  It was a fucking race!
[18:14.010 --> 18:14.390]  What?
[18:15.750 --> 18:17.090]  How do you get the tail?
[18:17.190 --> 18:18.790]  Oh, my God, you piece of shit.
[18:19.550 --> 18:20.770]  I thought I had it the whole time.
[18:20.970 --> 18:21.410]  Did Gavin make it?
[18:22.070 --> 18:23.890]  He did, because he got the stupid jetpack.
[18:23.890 --> 18:28.690]  I got the jetpack, and Andrew came with me based purely on belief that he also had it.
[18:29.130 --> 18:29.530]  You made it?
[18:29.530 --> 18:31.230]  Yeah, just as far as I did, pretty much.
[18:31.350 --> 18:32.950]  It's the furthest I've gone.
[18:33.530 --> 18:34.990]  I bounced off the edge, Geoff.
[18:35.010 --> 18:35.870]  I had it.
[18:35.970 --> 18:37.130]  Oh, Geoff, I see the coin.
[18:37.630 --> 18:38.350]  I wonder if you...
[18:38.350 --> 18:39.870]  Geoff, you gotta make that big jump, bud.
[18:40.130 --> 18:41.550]  You gotta make it bounce up, dude.
[18:41.550 --> 18:42.950]  I think you gotta go to the right.
[18:43.010 --> 18:44.130]  I think you gotta go for it.
[18:46.610 --> 18:50.730]  That black hole is the bane of my existence right now.
[18:50.850 --> 18:51.370]  Oh, come on.
[18:52.050 --> 18:52.630]  So close.
[18:52.790 --> 18:53.610]  Oh, you wish.
[18:54.110 --> 18:55.530]  Andrew's still on a 90%.
[18:55.530 --> 18:58.990]  It's not like it matters, but he's still on a fucking 90%.
[19:04.920 --> 19:06.260]  You son of a...
[19:08.380 --> 19:09.900]  No shortcuts, bitch.
[19:10.480 --> 19:11.800]  Yeah, go fuck yourself.
[19:14.200 --> 19:16.480]  Me and Andrew got the game plan, baby.
[19:20.960 --> 19:22.000]  Oh, shit.
[19:22.200 --> 19:22.520]  Alright.
[19:23.280 --> 19:23.380]  Oh, shit.
[19:23.780 --> 19:24.140]  Soup.
[19:32.200 --> 19:32.720]  No!
[19:35.440 --> 19:37.260]  Oh, I just left the coin right at the end.
[19:39.220 --> 19:40.480]  Oh, can Eric do it?
[19:41.040 --> 19:42.060]  Oh, wow.
[19:42.300 --> 19:42.740]  Eric.
[19:42.740 --> 19:43.440]  I caught it.
[19:43.940 --> 19:45.140]  This is your moment.
[19:46.280 --> 19:46.640]  Alright, Eric.
[19:46.640 --> 19:48.000]  You can stand on the punch glove.
[19:50.520 --> 19:51.320]  Yeah, you should definitely...
[19:51.320 --> 19:52.340]  No, no, no, no!
[19:52.380 --> 19:52.740]  No!
[19:53.540 --> 19:55.380]  I tried to stand on the punch glove, Gavin.
[19:57.700 --> 19:59.580]  Alright, should we do a little where we can see?
[20:00.140 --> 20:00.620]  Uh, yeah.
[20:00.900 --> 20:01.040]  Yeah.
[20:01.420 --> 20:02.400]  Maybe where we don't...
[20:02.400 --> 20:02.800]  Oh, wow.
[20:02.880 --> 20:03.420]  Wow, Gavin.
[20:03.500 --> 20:04.960]  What a win for you, bud.
[20:06.800 --> 20:08.140]  Whoever picked that level...
[20:09.120 --> 20:09.320]  Idiot.
[20:09.540 --> 20:09.900]  Gavin picked it.
[20:11.480 --> 20:12.100]  Alright, Andrew.
[20:12.180 --> 20:13.060]  Fix your shitting.
[20:13.220 --> 20:13.700]  Yep, yep.
[20:13.700 --> 20:15.880]  There we go.
[20:16.180 --> 20:17.940]  I like that it happened again.
[20:20.780 --> 20:23.800]  Well, Andrew is remarkably consistent in that.
[20:24.040 --> 20:25.580]  I'm gonna go mainframe.
[20:26.140 --> 20:28.900]  So there's, like, new panda DLC with new levels, I think.
[20:29.020 --> 20:29.960]  I don't know how to get it, though.
[20:31.260 --> 20:32.060]  Probably with money.
[20:33.480 --> 20:35.800]  Does anyone in chat know how to get all the panda stuff?
[20:35.920 --> 20:37.100]  Do you have to buy it?
[20:41.820 --> 20:44.780]  Uh, looks like chat said, go fuck yourself.
[20:45.380 --> 20:45.780]  Okay.
[20:47.080 --> 20:49.660]  Looks like chat says, uh, Geoff can't be heard.
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.960]  Someone said, nope.
[20:51.220 --> 20:51.780]  No clue.
[20:52.220 --> 20:52.660]  Nope.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.060]  That's essentially what I said they said.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.220]  NFT Steven says, buy tickets to Kung Fu Panda.
[21:01.180 --> 21:02.100]  Where do we start?
[21:02.600 --> 21:02.620]  So this...
[21:02.620 --> 21:07.720]  This one I think you actually make the next attempt's path based on your path.
[21:08.600 --> 21:08.940]  Oh.
[21:09.340 --> 21:10.000]  I'm not sure...
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.220]  I'm not quite sure what that means, but I'm excited to find out.
[21:13.340 --> 21:15.500]  Yeah, it'll take you one pass to realize what it means.
[21:18.720 --> 21:19.600]  You got it, Andrew.
[21:20.780 --> 21:21.540]  Oh, wow!
[21:21.980 --> 21:22.900]  Oh, I do see.
[21:23.700 --> 21:24.080]  Whoops!
[21:27.000 --> 21:27.380]  Geoff?
[21:28.660 --> 21:29.540]  That's me, I'm Geoff.
[21:29.840 --> 21:31.000]  Big run, big run, big jump.
[21:31.360 --> 21:32.180]  There you go.
[21:32.260 --> 21:32.620]  Yeah!
[21:35.240 --> 21:35.620]  Hmm.
[21:35.660 --> 21:37.500]  So there's no way to do that on the first run.
[21:37.760 --> 21:37.980]  Yeah.
[21:38.340 --> 21:38.960]  Doesn't seem like it.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.710]  Well, if you place stuff like fools...
[21:44.780 --> 21:45.380]  What the?
[21:45.420 --> 21:46.500]  He took everything I wanted!
[21:46.520 --> 21:46.820]  I don't think we have enough cannons.
[21:46.820 --> 21:49.620]  You better fucking jump on it next time.
[21:57.740 --> 21:59.080]  Oh, that's awesome!
[22:01.660 --> 22:04.240]  I feel like a Donkey Kong bonus level.
[22:04.300 --> 22:06.340]  No, no, no, no, no.
[22:06.400 --> 22:07.100]  Is the middle real?
[22:07.480 --> 22:08.320]  Is this real, this thing?
[22:08.560 --> 22:08.780]  Yeah.
[22:10.560 --> 22:10.960]  Yeah.
[22:11.040 --> 22:11.340]  Oh, it is.
[22:11.560 --> 22:12.100]  I thought you were lying.
[22:12.580 --> 22:13.320]  I didn't know.
[22:13.500 --> 22:14.720]  I just was saying that.
[22:15.200 --> 22:16.880]  Yeah, he actually was lying.
[22:16.980 --> 22:17.560]  He was just wrong.
[22:19.080 --> 22:19.580]  Oh, what?
[22:20.420 --> 22:23.520]  Oh, I thought I was going to get around it.
[22:23.580 --> 22:24.920]  I thought I was going to get around it.
[22:25.160 --> 22:26.720]  Geoff, I think if you jump in it and hold on...
[22:26.720 --> 22:27.040]  Oh, no!
[22:28.460 --> 22:28.860]  What?
[22:29.560 --> 22:30.640]  That was nothing.
[22:31.040 --> 22:33.580]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[22:34.560 --> 22:35.640]  Is this a joke?
[22:36.340 --> 22:38.060]  I hit right trigger on accident.
[22:38.260 --> 22:38.560]  The zoom.
[22:39.200 --> 22:39.980]  Oh, man.
[22:41.140 --> 22:42.320]  Oh, I regret my pick.
[22:42.640 --> 22:42.900]  Dammit.
[22:44.440 --> 22:45.200]  Oh, Christ.
[22:45.200 --> 22:45.900]  Oh, no.
[22:46.880 --> 22:47.520]  Oh, no.
[22:53.780 --> 22:57.760]  Geoff, you can turn that the right way up and you can stick it on the...
[22:57.760 --> 22:58.060]  Okay.
[22:58.660 --> 22:59.380]  You're putting it on the ceiling.
[22:59.480 --> 22:59.960]  Yeah, there you go.
[23:05.480 --> 23:05.800]  No!
[23:08.140 --> 23:10.100]  How the goddamn do I get around this?
[23:11.280 --> 23:12.700]  I don't know, but let me know.
[23:13.100 --> 23:13.660]  Oh, shit.
[23:16.540 --> 23:16.860]  Bye.
[23:21.590 --> 23:22.030]  Okay.
[23:22.390 --> 23:23.610]  I'm feeling good about this run.
[23:23.830 --> 23:25.370]  I think we're going to get a winner here.
[23:25.830 --> 23:26.270]  Okay.
[23:27.210 --> 23:28.290]  It's going to be me.
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.040]  Okay.
[23:43.950 --> 23:45.350]  Oh, that's crazy.
[23:46.850 --> 23:47.730]  Oh, you...
[23:47.730 --> 23:49.330]  Oh, sticky!
[23:51.770 --> 23:52.810]  Geoff, look out, it's sticky.
[23:52.930 --> 23:53.150]  No, no!
[23:53.770 --> 23:54.210]  No!
[23:55.090 --> 23:56.290]  Geoff hit two key buttons.
[23:57.910 --> 23:59.030]  Oh, oh, God.
[23:59.030 --> 23:59.150]  Okay.
[23:59.750 --> 24:00.230]  Goddamn.
[24:00.390 --> 24:02.010]  No, no, fool, no!
[24:02.270 --> 24:02.730]  Oh, God.
[24:10.320 --> 24:10.800]  Fuck!
[24:11.440 --> 24:11.860]  Hey!
[24:13.760 --> 24:14.720]  Well, you were right.
[24:15.240 --> 24:15.720]  Goddammit.
[24:17.480 --> 24:18.880]  Okay, yeah, you were right, Andrew.
[24:18.920 --> 24:19.440]  You called that.
[24:19.840 --> 24:19.960]  Nailed it.
[24:19.960 --> 24:21.420]  Yeah, I hate it.
[24:38.050 --> 24:39.170]  I love it.
[24:39.410 --> 24:40.270]  Andrew, I love it.
[24:41.510 --> 24:42.470]  Fucking psychopath.
[24:43.610 --> 24:44.470]  Oh, my God.
[24:44.470 --> 24:44.930]  No!
[24:45.350 --> 24:46.410]  We have to get out of here!
[24:47.190 --> 24:48.090]  Well, that did it.
[24:48.410 --> 24:49.890]  That did the trick real nice.
[24:50.450 --> 24:52.470]  All right, and step two is...
[24:53.030 --> 24:53.330]  Go ahead.
[24:54.330 --> 24:54.810]  Anytime.
[24:55.730 --> 24:56.690]  Oh, shit.
[24:57.410 --> 24:58.470]  Oh, my God.
[24:59.350 --> 25:00.450]  Free and clear.
[25:00.930 --> 25:02.170]  Just walked right in.
[25:02.490 --> 25:03.390]  You got buzzsawed, idiot.
[25:03.710 --> 25:04.190]  Shit!
[25:06.570 --> 25:07.650]  I want to go...
[25:07.990 --> 25:08.270]  Oh, man.
[25:09.750 --> 25:11.010]  Geoff, Geoff, just...
[25:11.010 --> 25:11.830]  All the way to the right, man.
[25:11.830 --> 25:12.290]  You just got...
[25:12.290 --> 25:12.970]  Just don't jump on that!
[25:13.950 --> 25:14.310]  Geoff!
[25:16.410 --> 25:17.710]  I don't understand.
[25:21.430 --> 25:23.290]  Well, at least everyone in the chat can hear you, man.
[25:23.810 --> 25:24.090]  Yeah.
[25:24.550 --> 25:25.670]  I live the longest.
[25:27.890 --> 25:28.890]  Ooh, I like this.
[25:28.970 --> 25:31.070]  All right, let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.
[25:31.130 --> 25:31.830]  What are we thinking?
[25:32.110 --> 25:33.130]  What do we want to do here?
[25:39.610 --> 25:39.970]  What?
[25:44.170 --> 25:45.230]  This is killing me.
[25:45.230 --> 25:46.730]  Is Geoff still there?
[25:46.810 --> 25:47.550]  I can't hear him.
[25:47.630 --> 25:49.310]  Geoff is definitely quieter.
[25:51.330 --> 25:51.990]  Oh, no.
[25:52.070 --> 25:52.710]  You should not...
[25:52.710 --> 25:54.190]  You shouldn't be like...
[25:54.190 --> 25:57.050]  You've been playing recorded video games your whole career.
[25:57.390 --> 25:58.590]  Don't start reading the chat.
[25:59.070 --> 26:00.150]  I'm going to have to...
[26:00.150 --> 26:01.990]  I'm going to have to start talking louder.
[26:02.170 --> 26:02.430]  No!
[26:03.030 --> 26:03.790]  I fell through the middle!
[26:04.150 --> 26:04.210]  Wait.
[26:05.590 --> 26:08.170]  Wait, did I do it?
[26:08.330 --> 26:09.390]  Yeah, you got posty.
[26:10.370 --> 26:10.810]  Oh!
[26:11.730 --> 26:12.910]  Oh, I thought I screwed myself.
[26:13.210 --> 26:13.630]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[26:15.330 --> 26:17.570]  Like, you're not even at like 90%, dude.
[26:17.630 --> 26:18.050]  Good work.
[26:21.610 --> 26:27.330]  Somebody asked if we have any plans to do another Sloppy Joe stream in the near future.
[26:27.490 --> 26:29.790]  I don't think we've settled on anything, but we will definitely do one.
[26:29.790 --> 26:33.170]  No, no, we haven't yet, but I imagine we'll do one probably pretty soon.
[26:33.290 --> 26:34.870]  Do we have any streams coming up, Andrew?
[26:36.570 --> 26:37.790]  Not that we have...
[26:37.790 --> 26:38.830]  Oh, no, we do.
[26:39.110 --> 26:39.810]  Next week.
[26:40.350 --> 26:43.330]  We're doing a community event for Falcons.
[26:43.630 --> 26:44.590]  Oh, for Falcons.
[26:44.590 --> 26:45.910]  We're going to watch the APW.
[26:46.270 --> 26:47.010]  Oh, hell yeah!
[26:47.230 --> 26:47.730]  Yes, on the Patreon.
[26:48.070 --> 26:49.730]  Is that on next Friday?
[26:50.190 --> 26:50.890]  Next Saturday.
[26:50.990 --> 26:51.470]  Next Saturday.
[26:51.850 --> 26:53.670]  Oh, I think I might not be able to attend that.
[26:54.070 --> 26:54.610]  Oh, wow.
[26:55.070 --> 26:55.650]  Oh, thanks, man.
[26:55.710 --> 26:57.630]  I mean, it's just like one of the biggest nights of my career.
[26:57.730 --> 26:58.010]  That's fine.
[26:58.190 --> 26:59.970]  I mean, it's, you know, it's not a big deal, I guess.
[27:01.390 --> 27:04.050]  Yeah, for people that are Falconing up, we will be watching live on stage.
[27:04.050 --> 27:04.590]  You bastard!
[27:04.770 --> 27:05.910]  I'll kill you next time.
[27:06.050 --> 27:06.670]  You're dead.
[27:06.850 --> 27:07.910]  I swear to God.
[27:08.210 --> 27:10.470]  Oh my God, he just rode me all the way down.
[27:10.730 --> 27:11.270]  You bitch.
[27:11.510 --> 27:13.130]  Oh, yeah, I can't come to your event.
[27:13.130 --> 27:13.890]  Die now.
[27:14.010 --> 27:14.630]  Thanks, man.
[27:14.850 --> 27:20.910]  Anyway, Saturday next week, I do commentary for AAPW local wrestling show.
[27:21.630 --> 27:26.010]  We are going to do, everyone watch it on Twitch, at official AAPW.
[27:26.450 --> 27:32.450]  And you can join on the Discord and there will be like even more talking on top of it.
[27:32.550 --> 27:33.530]  Why are there bees?
[27:34.390 --> 27:35.610]  Oh my God!
[27:35.790 --> 27:36.690]  Why are there bees?
[27:37.070 --> 27:37.730]  There's fire!
[27:37.930 --> 27:38.890]  I'm already dead!
[27:39.110 --> 27:40.470]  Don't even think, don't even think, don't even think.
[27:40.490 --> 27:41.130]  Get a move!
[27:41.210 --> 27:41.610]  Don't even think.
[27:41.610 --> 27:42.290]  Fuck!
[27:42.470 --> 27:43.830]  You pushed me, you bastard.
[27:46.770 --> 27:46.990]  Yeah!
[27:48.550 --> 27:49.150]  Oh dear.
[27:49.930 --> 27:51.630]  It's a bit of a predicament.
[27:53.090 --> 27:53.650]  Wow!
[27:55.330 --> 27:55.890]  Ooh!
[27:56.930 --> 27:58.470]  Seems like you handled it pretty well.
[27:58.870 --> 28:00.130]  God damn it!
[28:02.790 --> 28:03.170]  Cuckoo!
[28:04.010 --> 28:06.730]  Some of your jokes said, any more drafts?
[28:06.730 --> 28:07.650]  We just recorded three.
[28:08.430 --> 28:09.190]  Yeah, we did.
[28:09.190 --> 28:11.890]  We'll have some more drafts coming up in the next few weeks.
[28:12.350 --> 28:12.610]  What did we do?
[28:12.670 --> 28:16.050]  We did breakfast, food, and two were definitely usable.
[28:16.810 --> 28:17.950]  Two were definitely usable.
[28:18.070 --> 28:19.310]  All three of them are usable.
[28:21.390 --> 28:24.350]  Two of them are stronger than one of them, that's all.
[28:28.290 --> 28:32.230]  I guess the question mark ones will have like unlockables in them maybe?
[28:32.710 --> 28:33.130]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:33.150 --> 28:33.770]  Oh, hell yeah.
[28:34.090 --> 28:35.090]  What am I doing on this one then?
[28:35.610 --> 28:35.870]  I don't know.
[28:36.170 --> 28:37.850]  When I could be in the ballroom!
[28:38.610 --> 28:40.090]  I'm in the old mansion, baby.
[28:40.270 --> 28:41.610]  I wanna unlock something.
[28:42.010 --> 28:43.170]  I wanna unlock some new sunglasses for Nick or something.
[28:46.450 --> 28:47.230]  Nick's goggles.
[28:47.750 --> 28:48.930]  It's fucking bullshit.
[28:49.430 --> 28:51.310]  What do you think it's gonna be, ballroom or old mansion?
[28:53.670 --> 28:54.110]  Ballroom!
[28:54.170 --> 28:54.950]  Ballroom it is!
[28:56.790 --> 28:59.290]  Oh, look at that. That could be a new level or man.
[28:59.890 --> 29:01.250]  Or it could be Nick's sunglasses.
[29:04.850 --> 29:06.330]  Where do we start? Okay.
[29:15.020 --> 29:17.480]  Man, what if we unlocked a new level today and got to...
[29:18.240 --> 29:22.020]  What? Look at Andrew the bastard.
[29:23.420 --> 29:24.300]  No! No!
[29:24.860 --> 29:25.800]  Where's the finish?
[29:26.300 --> 29:28.380]  See the big flag? The big pink flag?
[29:28.780 --> 29:28.980]  No.
[29:29.880 --> 29:30.100]  Oh.
[29:30.900 --> 29:32.060]  So, I don't know.
[29:34.340 --> 29:35.400]  Is this where it is?
[29:35.780 --> 29:37.960]  No, it's down in the middle with the big flag.
[29:38.200 --> 29:39.360]  What do you mean in the... what?
[29:40.820 --> 29:41.260]  Oh.
[29:41.920 --> 29:42.680]  Down there.
[29:43.280 --> 29:43.420]  Yeah.
[29:43.820 --> 29:45.100]  Well, how do I get down there?
[29:45.240 --> 29:47.780]  Well, I put some nice planes there for you to use.
[29:48.160 --> 29:48.840]  Like that?
[29:49.320 --> 29:49.640]  Yep.
[29:49.860 --> 29:51.100]  You can jump into it.
[29:51.900 --> 29:53.520]  Just run and jump into it, Geoff. Go!
[29:54.160 --> 29:54.380]  Yep.
[29:54.800 --> 29:55.200]  No!
[29:56.220 --> 29:56.880]  You don't get it?
[29:57.360 --> 29:57.640]  No.
[30:00.240 --> 30:01.040]  Solo raccoon!
[30:01.600 --> 30:02.420]  That was ruthless.
[30:02.980 --> 30:03.720]  That was pretty ruthless.
[30:05.680 --> 30:06.340]  Oh, shit.
[30:13.800 --> 30:15.200]  Where do we start? Oh, we start from right here.
[30:23.340 --> 30:24.420]  Who's gonna be gutsy?
[30:25.120 --> 30:26.100]  Oh, my God.
[30:26.140 --> 30:27.040]  Who's gonna be gutsy?
[30:27.280 --> 30:27.860]  I'm going for it!
[30:27.920 --> 30:30.120]  No! You're shoving me the whole way!
[30:32.600 --> 30:32.980]  Rollercoaster!
[30:33.100 --> 30:34.140]  Is that a new level?
[30:34.740 --> 30:38.040]  It's new for me. I know it's not new for the game, because I haven't played it.
[30:38.080 --> 30:39.260]  No! Wait, did I get it?
[30:40.840 --> 30:41.220]  Oops.
[30:42.220 --> 30:43.340]  Oh, you motherfuckers!
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.720]  Geoff, you motherfucker!
[30:45.620 --> 30:47.860]  Geoff, is there anything you want to say that the chat can't hear?
[30:47.860 --> 30:51.480]  You motherfucker! Gavin!
[30:51.480 --> 30:52.440]  I think I can hear that.
[30:52.460 --> 30:54.440]  Gavin Free, you dumb piece of...
[30:54.440 --> 30:58.320]  I am gonna drive to your house and burn you down!
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.760]  Oh, my God!
[31:01.140 --> 31:03.860]  Oh, you prick!
[31:05.880 --> 31:06.860]  That was pretty good, though.
[31:08.380 --> 31:09.300]  Oh, we're over here now.
[31:09.960 --> 31:10.460]  That was cool.
[31:10.860 --> 31:11.680]  What are you... Get off me!
[31:13.900 --> 31:16.140]  Alright, what's the best way to...
[31:16.140 --> 31:16.520]  Geoff!
[31:17.080 --> 31:17.480]  Stop.
[31:18.140 --> 31:18.540]  Whoops.
[31:18.800 --> 31:19.440]  Thank you.
[31:20.200 --> 31:22.960]  Alright, Gavin's dead. Let's fucking move on.
[31:23.580 --> 31:24.300]  I missed!
[31:24.500 --> 31:25.660]  Oh, I was so close!
[31:25.940 --> 31:27.280]  Is that what you're gonna say at my funeral?
[31:27.740 --> 31:27.880]  Yeah.
[31:31.240 --> 31:32.560]  Bold of you to think we'll...
[31:32.560 --> 31:33.000]  Ah, fuck!
[31:33.880 --> 31:36.880]  Fucking bounced off your spongy little body!
[31:37.620 --> 31:38.580]  I'm a death sponge!
[31:38.660 --> 31:38.980]  Damn it!
[31:39.160 --> 31:39.760]  You death sponge!
[31:39.820 --> 31:40.680]  No, wait!
[31:41.160 --> 31:41.800]  Did you do it?
[31:41.820 --> 31:42.300]  Did I do it?
[31:42.580 --> 31:42.880]  No.
[31:42.980 --> 31:43.440]  Did I do it?
[31:43.440 --> 31:43.780]  No.
[31:43.940 --> 31:44.680]  No way.
[31:44.900 --> 31:45.640]  He did!
[31:46.800 --> 31:47.320]  Motherfucker!
[31:47.680 --> 31:48.040]  Wow.
[31:48.200 --> 31:48.480]  Oh.
[31:48.860 --> 31:49.380]  Oh.
[31:49.720 --> 31:50.140]  Oh.
[31:50.560 --> 31:51.440]  Eric did it.
[31:52.220 --> 31:52.600]  Oh, weird!
[31:55.180 --> 31:55.700]  Alright.
[31:57.060 --> 31:57.780]  There we go.
[31:58.840 --> 32:00.100]  Oh, my God.
[32:00.320 --> 32:01.300]  So, wait, there's no way to...
[32:01.300 --> 32:02.400]  How do you do this?
[32:04.080 --> 32:05.040]  Gotta go down.
[32:06.320 --> 32:07.200]  And yelling timber!
[32:08.340 --> 32:08.860]  Shit!
[32:10.940 --> 32:12.660]  Wow, look at Gavin's moves!
[32:13.260 --> 32:13.620]  Hey!
[32:14.720 --> 32:15.620]  Pretty cool, Gav.
[32:16.980 --> 32:17.480]  Thanks, Geoff.
[32:17.940 --> 32:19.520]  Goddammit, I was trying to time it.
[32:20.560 --> 32:22.360]  I was trying to time it just a little different.
[32:22.740 --> 32:23.100]  Goddammit.
[32:24.440 --> 32:26.840]  That was the first time slow-mo has been helpful.
[32:27.800 --> 32:29.260]  I mean, you made a whole career out of it, didn't you?
[32:29.260 --> 32:30.860]  In my life, just in this game.
[32:32.640 --> 32:33.380]  I would agree.
[32:33.580 --> 32:34.760]  Gimme this, gimme this, gimme this.
[32:38.360 --> 32:39.080]  Jesus Christ!
[32:39.080 --> 32:39.260]  Jesus Christ!
[32:42.040 --> 32:43.260]  You can move it, you can move it.
[32:44.420 --> 32:45.040]  That'll go.
[32:47.800 --> 32:48.380]  That'll go.
[32:49.040 --> 32:49.680]  Right there.
[32:53.080 --> 32:53.520]  Insane.
[32:56.500 --> 32:57.600]  Oh, my good God.
[32:57.660 --> 32:58.320]  What the fuck?
[33:00.280 --> 33:00.720]  Right.
[33:01.920 --> 33:02.460]  Right there.
[33:02.480 --> 33:04.500]  I got pushed and it hit and jumped!
[33:08.730 --> 33:09.610]  Stupid slow-mo.
[33:11.370 --> 33:12.750]  I got bashed!
[33:14.970 --> 33:16.030]  Did I get it?
[33:16.610 --> 33:18.210]  Geoff, you might have gotten it.
[33:19.470 --> 33:20.990]  If I didn't get it.
[33:21.070 --> 33:21.970]  If I didn't get it.
[33:22.550 --> 33:23.510]  Geoff didn't get it.
[33:23.770 --> 33:23.990]  No!
[33:24.870 --> 33:26.990]  Geoff, you're almost there.
[33:28.470 --> 33:30.010]  How did I not get it?
[33:37.460 --> 33:38.680]  Oh, my God.
[33:39.980 --> 33:42.360]  This is insane.
[33:48.820 --> 33:50.340]  Oh, that's wild.
[33:50.620 --> 33:51.520]  Where are we starting?
[33:52.000 --> 33:52.420]  Who knows?
[33:52.580 --> 33:53.140]  Oh, top right?
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.640]  Top right, yep.
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.140]  Geoff, don't... Geoff?
[34:04.220 --> 34:04.780]  No!
[34:05.220 --> 34:06.220]  Don't be Geoff and me.
[34:06.640 --> 34:09.380]  How the Christ did anyone get...
[34:09.580 --> 34:10.800]  I almost had it.
[34:10.940 --> 34:13.580]  The fire's the tough part, bud.
[34:13.660 --> 34:14.240]  Fuck me.
[34:15.560 --> 34:15.980]  Oh!
[34:17.580 --> 34:18.000]  No!
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.740]  Is that my fault?
[34:24.780 --> 34:26.320]  How many trap points do I get?
[34:26.720 --> 34:28.940]  You only get the trap points if people finish, though.
[34:29.160 --> 34:29.580]  Fuck!
[34:30.080 --> 34:30.960]  Otherwise, people would just...
[34:30.960 --> 34:31.620]  That's the problem.
[34:33.120 --> 34:34.640]  I'm not using the bomb, fuck that.
[34:34.800 --> 34:35.620]  I love what we have.
[34:35.740 --> 34:39.100]  I grabbed it to stop anyone from destroying stuff.
[34:39.280 --> 34:39.540]  It's good.
[34:40.120 --> 34:41.280]  It's a defensive bomb.
[34:48.700 --> 34:49.200]  Geoff.
[34:50.120 --> 34:50.880]  Oh, Geoff.
[34:52.840 --> 34:54.500]  Oh, Gavin got the rocket pack.
[34:54.620 --> 34:56.480]  Don't know that it's doing anything for him, but he's doing it.
[34:57.900 --> 34:58.400]  Oops.
[34:58.540 --> 34:59.640]  Oh, my God!
[34:59.760 --> 35:01.240]  That was awesome!
[35:04.640 --> 35:05.140]  Oh!
[35:06.180 --> 35:06.920]  I didn't realize...
[35:06.920 --> 35:07.360]  No!
[35:07.700 --> 35:09.160]  I didn't even move.
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.400]  What a waste.
[35:13.180 --> 35:14.060]  You win.
[35:14.060 --> 35:19.300]  I was standing still, and I was watching Gavin, and then it looked back at me, and I just wasn't there.
[35:19.520 --> 35:20.200]  Oh, man.
[35:21.520 --> 35:22.160]  Jesus Christ.
[35:22.160 --> 35:22.380]  That was so cool.
[35:22.760 --> 35:24.900]  I was trying to edge the bottom of the screen, and I...
[35:24.900 --> 35:25.820]  Yeah, yeah, you're edging.
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.220]  I came.
[35:26.220 --> 35:27.020]  You're edging, all right.
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.800]  Wait, you said you were trying to edge the bottom of the screen, but you came instead?
[35:34.280 --> 35:34.600]  Yeah.
[35:35.680 --> 35:36.000]  Yeah.
[35:36.340 --> 35:37.340]  Just wanted to make sure I heard that right.
[35:40.100 --> 35:41.460]  All right, Gavin, what's the plan here?
[35:50.820 --> 35:52.040]  You run out of time, Andrew.
[35:52.220 --> 35:52.500]  Great.
[35:52.740 --> 35:53.660]  I panicked Andrew.
[35:53.720 --> 35:54.480]  That's what I needed.
[35:55.840 --> 35:56.980]  That always works well.
[35:57.340 --> 35:57.560]  Yeah.
[35:59.400 --> 36:00.240]  I got it!
[36:00.260 --> 36:01.560]  How did you get in there?
[36:02.520 --> 36:03.220]  Woo-hoo!
[36:04.100 --> 36:04.500]  No!
[36:04.840 --> 36:06.580]  Does that mean Eric is going to win?
[36:06.620 --> 36:07.240]  Goddamn right!
[36:07.340 --> 36:08.360]  Raccoon wins again, baby!
[36:10.520 --> 36:11.080]  Oh, Gavin.
[36:11.300 --> 36:11.580]  Shit!
[36:11.760 --> 36:11.980]  Yeah!
[36:12.020 --> 36:13.020]  Fucking hell!
[36:15.060 --> 36:15.740]  Oh, shit!
[36:15.740 --> 36:16.300]  How did I die?
[36:16.680 --> 36:17.520]  How did I die?
[36:17.620 --> 36:18.220]  Taken to victory.
[36:18.520 --> 36:19.260]  Post-mortem.
[36:19.620 --> 36:20.240]  Could it happen?
[36:21.020 --> 36:21.760]  Goddamn it!
[36:22.420 --> 36:23.500]  Look at that!
[36:23.680 --> 36:24.400]  I can't...
[36:25.020 --> 36:25.600]  Damn it.
[36:26.420 --> 36:28.260]  That is an ultimate raccoon.
[36:28.740 --> 36:29.500]  That's right, baby.
[36:29.700 --> 36:30.720]  Look at his little tie.
[36:31.260 --> 36:31.920]  Great job, Eric.
[36:32.480 --> 36:32.700]  Thank you.
[36:32.700 --> 36:35.240]  Maybe we should go to the rollercoaster or...
[36:35.240 --> 36:36.060]  Yeah, let's do it.
[36:36.060 --> 36:36.880]  Let's see what that is.
[36:36.980 --> 36:37.460]  No, let's do it.
[36:37.500 --> 36:38.260]  Let's do the rollercoaster.
[36:38.540 --> 36:39.060]  Where is it?
[36:42.180 --> 36:43.200]  Oh, it's over here on the right.
[36:44.280 --> 36:44.620]  Right?
[36:44.820 --> 36:44.960]  Yeah.
[36:46.640 --> 36:47.720]  Oh, wow, we did it.
[36:47.800 --> 36:50.840]  So this one, I think you just get slammed by it as it comes around.
[36:51.060 --> 36:51.360]  Alright, cool.
[36:51.500 --> 36:52.460]  Oh, that's great.
[36:52.640 --> 36:53.040]  You know what?
[36:53.280 --> 36:53.740]  We're on the...
[36:53.740 --> 36:54.140]  No, no, no.
[36:54.580 --> 36:54.920]  I won't.
[37:02.180 --> 37:03.180]  Rats win again, baby.
[37:03.780 --> 37:06.780]  Oh, ClutchMyPearl said they're ready for the Gav and Geoff.
[37:06.820 --> 37:09.960]  I wonder who's got the ClutchMyPearl's account on Twitch.
[37:10.980 --> 37:11.800]  It's probably your wife.
[37:12.320 --> 37:13.000]  Or your wife.
[37:13.840 --> 37:14.480]  Is it unofficial?
[37:15.400 --> 37:17.000]  I don't know.
[37:17.160 --> 37:17.520]  Probably.
[37:18.400 --> 37:20.540]  Like, our fucking fans are just taking names and going,
[37:20.700 --> 37:22.160]  we'll see what we can do with this.
[37:22.440 --> 37:22.800]  Thanks, guys.
[37:27.620 --> 37:29.560]  Somebody said, hey, I thought about this,
[37:29.580 --> 37:32.200]  and I thought somebody else might take this and try to make it hard for you,
[37:32.340 --> 37:33.360]  so I decided to.
[37:33.380 --> 37:34.820]  So anyway, I fucked you.
[37:34.960 --> 37:35.560]  Thanks, man.
[37:35.580 --> 37:36.060]  Big fan.
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.600]  Oh, my God!
[37:39.240 --> 37:41.020]  I didn't realize it was coming that fast.
[37:42.320 --> 37:43.040]  You can't...
[37:43.040 --> 37:43.640]  Oh, my God.
[37:47.560 --> 37:48.600]  Oh, my God.
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.200]  You can't...
[37:49.200 --> 37:50.300]  You run into this.
[37:50.520 --> 37:51.300]  You run into this.
[37:51.500 --> 37:52.780]  You can't make this jump.
[37:53.060 --> 37:53.780]  You can't.
[37:53.980 --> 37:55.280]  There's nothing to jump to.
[37:58.160 --> 38:01.280]  I thought you could jump through the rail like the track.
[38:02.180 --> 38:02.380]  Yeah.
[38:03.720 --> 38:04.760]  You can't.
[38:09.680 --> 38:12.420]  I know what I need, so I'll just build this.
[38:12.420 --> 38:13.280]  Thanks, man.
[38:13.320 --> 38:13.920]  Appreciate it.
[38:13.920 --> 38:14.320]  Thanks, Andrew.
[38:14.500 --> 38:15.280]  Yeah, you're doing great, man.
[38:15.280 --> 38:16.140]  I appreciate you, dude.
[38:16.420 --> 38:16.940]  Thanks, dude.
[38:17.100 --> 38:17.840]  I appreciate you, man.
[38:18.140 --> 38:18.400]  Thanks.
[38:18.960 --> 38:19.200]  Great.
[38:19.460 --> 38:19.880]  No problem.
[38:20.120 --> 38:21.080]  Love to collaborate.
[38:21.200 --> 38:21.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:21.740 --> 38:22.220]  Good one, too.
[38:24.440 --> 38:25.240]  No shit!
[38:25.500 --> 38:26.980]  You fucking moron.
[38:27.880 --> 38:28.120]  Whoops.
[38:32.500 --> 38:33.240]  You're welcome.
[38:33.580 --> 38:36.200]  You have to land on a moving one-by-one spot.
[38:37.280 --> 38:39.040]  Oh, no.
[38:39.080 --> 38:39.780]  There's a free spot.
[38:40.100 --> 38:40.420]  Easy.
[38:40.420 --> 38:41.200]  Easy.
[38:41.320 --> 38:42.300]  You bastard.
[38:42.440 --> 38:43.280]  Why do I suck?
[38:44.560 --> 38:45.740]  You do suck.
[38:48.780 --> 38:49.640]  It doesn't matter.
[38:49.840 --> 38:51.200]  We're not gonna be able to get there from there.
[38:52.000 --> 38:52.320]  Anyway.
[38:52.760 --> 38:53.640]  That's what you think.
[38:54.140 --> 38:55.040]  Oh, goddammit.
[39:01.590 --> 39:03.290]  I like the music changes to be like...
[39:03.290 --> 39:05.150]  It's like 80s, like, fucking scary.
[39:05.330 --> 39:05.750]  That's cool.
[39:06.090 --> 39:06.850]  It's like, oh, fuck.
[39:06.910 --> 39:07.510]  You're getting intense.
[39:08.270 --> 39:08.670]  You're...
[39:08.670 --> 39:10.290]  You guys suck ass.
[39:10.390 --> 39:11.450]  What is wrong with you?
[39:12.690 --> 39:14.130]  What's your fricking problem?
[39:14.350 --> 39:15.790]  What the fuck?
[39:16.710 --> 39:17.670]  Trying to make it fun.
[39:18.590 --> 39:20.530]  Yeah, we love it.
[39:20.610 --> 39:22.430]  We're not gonna be able to get to the fucking cannon.
[39:23.750 --> 39:25.190]  If you jump over that thing, you can.
[39:27.790 --> 39:28.770]  Got you first!
[39:33.150 --> 39:34.090]  What the fuck?
[39:34.150 --> 39:35.910]  Why can't I ever make it to the plank?
[39:36.230 --> 39:37.090]  Shitty plank.
[39:37.850 --> 39:39.150]  Just pushing my body.
[39:39.810 --> 39:40.830]  Trying to get it off.
[39:41.450 --> 39:42.250]  What do you mean?
[39:42.670 --> 39:43.310]  Leave it.
[39:43.950 --> 39:44.630]  Look at him.
[39:44.670 --> 39:45.610]  He's got a little exercise.
[39:45.970 --> 39:46.610]  Oh, man.
[39:47.190 --> 39:47.910]  Oh, man.
[39:48.610 --> 39:49.270]  There we go.
[39:49.450 --> 39:49.990]  Good job, Geoff.
[39:50.390 --> 39:50.870]  Thank you.
[39:53.810 --> 39:54.790]  You got it right here.
[39:55.690 --> 39:56.750]  Don't go too soon, bud.
[39:59.630 --> 40:01.270]  Now, what do you do, bud?
[40:01.570 --> 40:02.430]  What do you got, Geoff?
[40:03.310 --> 40:04.010]  He's done it.
[40:05.390 --> 40:06.050]  Alright, man.
[40:06.050 --> 40:06.950]  Just making it fun.
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.410]  But thanks to Geoff.
[40:08.530 --> 40:09.710]  Yeah, just making it fun.
[40:10.270 --> 40:10.610]  No!
[40:10.610 --> 40:11.530]  Andrew jumped into it.
[40:11.530 --> 40:12.750]  Just gotta jump over that thing and you're good.
[40:13.130 --> 40:14.970]  I was looking at Geoff and I forgot.
[40:15.210 --> 40:16.210]  I was like, okay, now I can go.
[40:16.570 --> 40:17.030]  It's all clear.
[40:17.310 --> 40:18.130]  Oh, shit.
[40:18.190 --> 40:19.210]  Right into the roller coaster.
[40:31.040 --> 40:33.420]  And we all are running over to...
[40:33.420 --> 40:33.720]  Okay.
[40:37.700 --> 40:39.000]  Oh, my God.
[40:39.780 --> 40:40.220]  Andrew.
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.100]  Gonna make it easier over there.
[40:46.260 --> 40:47.340]  Gonna make it tougher down there.
[40:47.620 --> 40:47.700]  And it's sticky.
[40:47.840 --> 40:48.880]  And it's sticky.
[40:50.120 --> 40:51.320]  Alright, Geoff, go for it.
[40:52.260 --> 40:53.320]  Hang on, like...
[40:53.880 --> 40:55.380]  Alright, Geoff, go for it.
[40:55.540 --> 40:57.100]  He went to the back of the line.
[40:58.080 --> 40:59.320]  I know how it works.
[41:00.240 --> 41:01.120]  I forfeited my turn.
[41:04.850 --> 41:05.210]  Andrew!
[41:11.390 --> 41:13.590]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[41:15.850 --> 41:16.970]  This one's doable now.
[41:17.530 --> 41:18.310]  Definitely doable.
[41:19.810 --> 41:21.030]  Just hitting the deck.
[41:21.730 --> 41:22.690]  Alright, man, you got it.
[41:23.390 --> 41:24.270]  Alright, you got it.
[41:24.530 --> 41:25.310]  You got it, right here.
[41:25.670 --> 41:26.750]  Why in the...
[41:28.650 --> 41:29.710]  It's not doable.
[41:29.970 --> 41:30.310]  You can't...
[41:31.450 --> 41:32.370]  It is doable.
[41:33.090 --> 41:35.270]  You can't get from right there to up there.
[41:35.570 --> 41:37.710]  You just climb the purple stairs.
[41:37.790 --> 41:38.730]  Yeah, if you're a good enough jumper, I guess you can.
[41:38.730 --> 41:39.750]  I don't think you can make that...
[41:39.750 --> 41:40.430]  It's too sticky.
[41:40.530 --> 41:41.670]  I don't think you can jump that far.
[41:42.330 --> 41:43.310]  What do you mean it's too sticky?
[41:44.070 --> 41:45.410]  What do you think I mean?
[41:45.470 --> 41:46.010]  What do you mean?
[41:46.170 --> 41:46.750]  What do you mean?
[41:46.750 --> 41:48.150]  What do I mean?
[41:48.290 --> 41:49.310]  He means too sticky.
[41:50.750 --> 41:52.450]  Alright, we'll see who wants it.
[42:01.700 --> 42:02.260]  What?
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.020]  Sticky ice?
[42:04.900 --> 42:05.460]  It's gonna...
[42:05.460 --> 42:06.300]  It's gonna...
[42:06.300 --> 42:07.460]  It's gonna...
[42:07.460 --> 42:09.880]  It's gonna counter-balance the sticky.
[42:09.940 --> 42:10.740]  Alright, Geoff, you're first.
[42:11.560 --> 42:12.960]  Go, Geoff's turn.
[42:16.020 --> 42:16.260]  Fuck.
[42:16.500 --> 42:16.800]  Fuck!
[42:17.660 --> 42:19.080]  Oh, look at that coin.
[42:19.080 --> 42:20.820]  Look at that coin winking at us.
[42:20.820 --> 42:21.220]  Whoa!
[42:21.500 --> 42:21.580]  That's what I'm saying.
[42:23.080 --> 42:23.980]  Alright, there's Geoff.
[42:33.860 --> 42:34.660]  Geoff got it!
[42:34.960 --> 42:35.800]  Geoff got it!
[42:38.200 --> 42:38.600]  Wow.
[42:43.940 --> 42:44.840]  Well, Geoff, take your time.
[42:45.540 --> 42:45.740]  Yeah.
[42:46.160 --> 42:46.600]  With the coin.
[42:46.760 --> 42:47.360]  Oh, I'm...
[42:47.360 --> 42:47.800]  Oh!
[42:49.660 --> 42:50.060]  Didn't...
[42:50.060 --> 42:52.580]  I thought I was bouncing off, hitting the wood, and then jumping up.
[42:52.640 --> 42:53.640]  Didn't fucking happen.
[42:55.020 --> 42:56.420]  What a coin grab.
[42:56.820 --> 42:57.400]  Goddamn.
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.140]  It's coming home, son!
[43:00.800 --> 43:02.100]  Is that what that means?
[43:02.380 --> 43:03.480]  That's what it means.
[43:05.500 --> 43:06.160]  Let's see what happens.
[43:06.220 --> 43:07.180]  What do we do now?
[43:07.320 --> 43:09.160]  What are we gonna do now?
[43:10.620 --> 43:11.220]  What?
[43:11.640 --> 43:12.240]  Gavin?
[43:12.860 --> 43:13.360]  Yeah.
[43:13.460 --> 43:14.220]  Gavin, what?
[43:14.760 --> 43:15.160]  Hello.
[43:16.180 --> 43:16.860]  What's the plan?
[43:19.880 --> 43:21.240]  Just don't be there for that.
[43:21.640 --> 43:21.880]  No!
[43:23.180 --> 43:24.040]  Well, now you've...
[43:24.720 --> 43:25.180]  Oh, shit!
[43:25.260 --> 43:26.820]  It's stupid idiot bodies in the way!
[43:26.960 --> 43:28.180]  Yeah, we have this again.
[43:28.600 --> 43:29.360]  You gotta push me.
[43:29.600 --> 43:29.720]  Oh!
[43:30.200 --> 43:30.700]  Push me!
[43:30.960 --> 43:31.840]  He tried to duck!
[43:33.300 --> 43:34.220]  We gotta push him.
[43:34.320 --> 43:34.780]  I don't know what to do.
[43:35.240 --> 43:36.780]  We gotta push him, like last time.
[43:39.280 --> 43:39.680]  Shove!
[43:41.160 --> 43:41.660]  Fuck it.
[43:41.740 --> 43:45.000]  Man, that thing down there, that contraption, absolute nightmare.
[43:45.220 --> 43:45.860]  Don't do what I did!
[43:46.440 --> 43:47.360]  What was that?
[43:49.140 --> 43:49.940]  I'm scared.
[43:50.840 --> 43:51.820]  Now, Eric!
[43:51.980 --> 43:52.960]  There's no now!
[43:53.080 --> 43:54.420]  There's nothing to jump to!
[43:54.560 --> 43:54.980]  Go!
[43:55.420 --> 43:56.280]  There's no now.
[43:57.280 --> 43:57.620]  Ah!
[43:57.940 --> 43:58.860]  There you go!
[43:59.000 --> 43:59.520]  Oh!
[44:10.380 --> 44:10.980]  Okay.
[44:20.370 --> 44:21.210]  Oh, wait.
[44:21.570 --> 44:22.410]  Who put the...
[44:23.890 --> 44:26.010]  Who put the bomb fly button...
[44:30.170 --> 44:31.270]  Oh, my hole.
[44:31.650 --> 44:32.110]  Yeah.
[44:32.250 --> 44:32.470]  What?
[44:34.390 --> 44:35.570]  Alright, Gavin, you're first.
[44:37.450 --> 44:38.370]  Oh, buddy!
[44:38.670 --> 44:39.950]  Oh, he's got this thing.
[44:40.530 --> 44:41.430]  Get gutsy.
[44:43.810 --> 44:45.250]  Geoff got squished.
[44:45.790 --> 44:45.870]  Ah!
[44:46.970 --> 44:47.870]  Go, Raccoon, go!
[44:50.050 --> 44:51.270]  Goddamn, what am I gonna do here?
[44:51.670 --> 44:51.790]  Ah!
[44:54.870 --> 44:56.930]  How the frickin' hell am I meant to frick?
[44:59.550 --> 45:00.490]  Who put that there?
[45:00.710 --> 45:02.190]  It's like a tiny little window of...
[45:02.190 --> 45:03.170]  You got it right...
[45:03.170 --> 45:03.350]  There!
[45:03.470 --> 45:03.630]  Go!
[45:04.130 --> 45:04.330]  Go!
[45:04.530 --> 45:04.670]  Go!
[45:05.150 --> 45:05.350]  Ah!
[45:05.970 --> 45:06.410]  Yeah!
[45:09.230 --> 45:09.670]  Yeah!
[45:11.790 --> 45:12.670]  Absolutely annihilated.
[45:13.030 --> 45:14.130]  That was a jump scare.
[45:14.390 --> 45:16.830]  I wish to God I could tip that rollercoaster driver.
[45:16.950 --> 45:18.170]  That was amazing timing.
[45:19.350 --> 45:19.790]  Oh.
[45:23.610 --> 45:24.650]  Gavin's thinking about it.
[45:25.290 --> 45:25.510]  Yeah.
[45:25.550 --> 45:25.850]  Sorry.
[45:25.950 --> 45:27.010]  It broke for a second.
[45:33.730 --> 45:35.730]  Oh my God, Hedgehog.
[45:38.030 --> 45:38.870]  Go!
[45:43.380 --> 45:43.740]  No!
[45:45.620 --> 45:46.820]  What is that?
[45:46.900 --> 45:47.140]  No!
[45:48.100 --> 45:49.320]  What was that?
[45:49.840 --> 45:51.040]  I didn't mean to back.
[45:56.220 --> 45:57.060]  Whoops!
[45:58.440 --> 46:02.600]  Ah, Christ.
[46:03.460 --> 46:04.560]  Oh, man.
[46:06.660 --> 46:07.840]  This is diff.
[46:08.340 --> 46:09.200]  Oops, I missed.
[46:09.800 --> 46:10.420]  It's a little diff.
[46:12.040 --> 46:13.080]  Did any of us take...
[46:13.080 --> 46:14.020]  None of us took bombs.
[46:14.460 --> 46:15.540]  None of us, we...
[46:15.540 --> 46:17.560]  We love what we've created.
[46:17.860 --> 46:18.600]  This is great.
[46:19.200 --> 46:20.420]  We're very happy with it.
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.560]  It's like, it's insane that this is the level, but we've decided that this is the level.
[46:27.240 --> 46:28.620]  Yeah, this is the level.
[46:28.760 --> 46:30.020]  I think you're right, Eric.
[46:30.380 --> 46:31.700]  It feels like this is the level.
[46:32.480 --> 46:32.920]  No!
[46:33.400 --> 46:34.300]  Oh, Gavin got the coin.
[46:34.300 --> 46:35.120]  Whoops!
[46:36.420 --> 46:37.540]  Oh my God.
[46:37.680 --> 46:38.420]  Geoff took the coin.
[46:39.540 --> 46:40.620]  God dammit, Geoff.
[46:41.320 --> 46:42.220]  Eric has the coin.
[46:42.360 --> 46:43.160]  Eric has the coin.
[46:43.500 --> 46:44.080]  Okay, raccoon time.
[46:44.360 --> 46:45.620]  Okay, alright, here we go.
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.400]  That's what Andrew sounded like playing Elder Scrolls earlier.
[46:52.060 --> 46:52.520]  I was...
[46:52.960 --> 46:53.900]  I was...
[46:53.900 --> 46:56.360]  I got too panicked before anything even happened.
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.280]  It's raccoon time.
[46:58.660 --> 47:01.760]  I'll just drop off without any...
[47:09.600 --> 47:10.260]  Good Lord.
[47:10.800 --> 47:12.120]  We need that like a hole in the asshole.
[47:12.380 --> 47:12.900]  Oops.
[47:14.520 --> 47:16.880]  I forgot about the roller coaster.
[47:20.740 --> 47:21.760]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[47:21.840 --> 47:22.940]  What the fuck?
[47:25.600 --> 47:27.240]  Alright, Gavin, it's raccoon time.
[47:27.300 --> 47:28.080]  You got it.
[47:28.340 --> 47:28.640]  Is it?
[47:29.100 --> 47:29.540]  Yeah.
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.340]  I'm very scared.
[47:32.780 --> 47:33.760]  Slow zoom.
[47:34.440 --> 47:35.620]  Alright, you got this, buddy.
[47:36.680 --> 47:37.020]  Ready?
[47:37.640 --> 47:38.860]  Oh, you're sad.
[47:38.860 --> 47:39.320]  Hang on.
[47:39.580 --> 47:40.960]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[47:41.200 --> 47:41.560]  Ready?
[47:41.680 --> 47:42.220]  Go, go.
[47:42.340 --> 47:42.500]  Ready?
[47:43.840 --> 47:45.960]  Oh, I was looking at stuff.
[47:47.000 --> 47:48.100]  I was looking.
[47:48.980 --> 47:49.880]  Oh, God.
[47:50.480 --> 47:52.200]  I was taking in the next part.
[47:53.660 --> 47:54.360]  That's gonna...
[47:54.360 --> 47:55.220]  Two turns.
[47:55.460 --> 47:56.240]  Jesus Christ.
[47:56.380 --> 47:56.540]  Okay.
[48:00.060 --> 48:01.200]  Is that all bombs?
[48:01.520 --> 48:01.820]  Yeah.
[48:02.220 --> 48:03.460]  Well, yeah, they want us to win.
[48:03.540 --> 48:04.320]  They ain't having it.
[48:27.590 --> 48:29.490]  Oh, I thought I was gonna catch it from the side.
[48:29.490 --> 48:31.690]  I was locked in on that one.
[48:31.750 --> 48:32.450]  I felt so good.
[48:33.030 --> 48:34.430]  That one felt like raccoon time.
[48:36.110 --> 48:37.750]  Oh, Gavin with the two coins.
[48:38.350 --> 48:39.310]  Get off my freaking head, though.
[48:39.770 --> 48:39.970]  Geoff can't...
[48:39.970 --> 48:40.470]  Geoff can't...
[48:41.210 --> 48:42.310]  Just get off me.
[48:45.390 --> 48:46.730]  Chat thinks Gavin's got it here.
[48:47.530 --> 48:47.670]  Okay.
[48:47.710 --> 48:48.630]  Oh, is this Gavin's turn?
[48:54.450 --> 48:54.810]  Yeah!
[48:57.810 --> 48:58.170]  Alright.
[48:58.310 --> 48:58.910]  Come on, Geoff.
[48:59.190 --> 48:59.910]  Come on, Geoff, you're up.
[49:00.310 --> 49:00.990]  There you go, there you go.
[49:02.670 --> 49:03.450]  You got it right here.
[49:03.590 --> 49:04.170]  You got it.
[49:04.330 --> 49:04.910]  You got it.
[49:04.990 --> 49:05.090]  Ready?
[49:05.570 --> 49:06.230]  Geoff, you ready?
[49:06.570 --> 49:07.290]  Geoff, you locked in?
[49:10.890 --> 49:11.710]  He's doing it!
[49:12.030 --> 49:12.350]  Oh!
[49:13.310 --> 49:14.190]  I got the glue!
[49:14.390 --> 49:15.350]  I got glued!
[49:17.570 --> 49:18.450]  You had that.
[49:18.450 --> 49:19.310]  You fucking had it!
[49:19.450 --> 49:21.910]  I thought, dude, Geoff, 100%, I thought you had that, dude.
[49:22.270 --> 49:22.770]  I did too.
[49:23.090 --> 49:23.610]  Last turn.
[49:24.090 --> 49:24.970]  This might be it, Geoff.
[49:25.050 --> 49:25.990]  You might win this thing.
[49:26.110 --> 49:26.470]  De facto.
[49:26.490 --> 49:27.150]  This is it.
[49:27.790 --> 49:29.150]  Oh, I just saw bees.
[49:29.930 --> 49:33.010]  Last turn of the stream, then we'll wrap it up.
[49:33.110 --> 49:33.270]  Yep.
[49:35.170 --> 49:36.350]  Where are we going?
[49:38.070 --> 49:39.310]  Oh, the bees?
[49:40.390 --> 49:41.670]  Oh my god, the bees.
[49:42.210 --> 49:43.890]  Be careful when coining!
[49:44.870 --> 49:46.150]  Crazy move!
[49:48.510 --> 49:49.110]  Shit!
[49:49.290 --> 49:49.530]  No!
[49:49.970 --> 49:50.230]  Fuck!
[49:50.230 --> 49:50.850]  Let's kill the bees!
[49:51.350 --> 49:51.790]  Dammit!
[49:51.970 --> 49:52.350]  I do.
[49:52.590 --> 49:53.370]  I got bead.
[49:54.450 --> 49:55.650]  Oh god!
[49:55.650 --> 49:59.130]  I think as long as Eric doesn't make it, Geoff wins.
[49:59.490 --> 50:00.490]  Unless he gets the coins.
[50:02.970 --> 50:04.570]  And he's got the coins.
[50:05.190 --> 50:05.510]  Oh!
[50:06.130 --> 50:06.610]  No!
[50:07.470 --> 50:08.230]  It's over!
[50:10.870 --> 50:12.190]  Unexpected turn of events.
[50:12.190 --> 50:12.710]  Not so sharp!
[50:12.790 --> 50:13.210]  What the fuck?
[50:13.270 --> 50:14.390]  Die 10 times to barbed wire.
[50:14.550 --> 50:15.170]  Alright, calm down.
[50:15.170 --> 50:15.650]  I win!
[50:16.530 --> 50:19.570]  I was the least offensively bad that round.
[50:21.090 --> 50:22.550]  Oh, what a game.
[50:23.470 --> 50:24.350]  What a stream.
[50:24.350 --> 50:25.010]  Well, I'm sad that's over.
[50:25.010 --> 50:25.950]  Thank you guys so much.
[50:26.050 --> 50:26.930]  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[50:27.330 --> 50:28.350]  We'll have to revisit this.
[50:28.530 --> 50:37.530]  Yeah, and if you guys liked watching this, we did a regulation gameplay in it recently that I think is up on the regulation gameplay YouTube channel.
[50:37.590 --> 50:38.150]  Because we have two!
[50:38.770 --> 50:41.870]  We have a podcast, a supplemental channel, and then the gameplay channel.
[50:41.950 --> 50:46.230]  So if you're only subscribed to one, you're missing half of the content and half of the jokes.
[50:47.170 --> 50:50.490]  And probably like 35% of the cool points.
[50:50.490 --> 50:54.210]  But again, don't forget, everyone, don't forget, check out our Patreon.
[50:54.310 --> 50:56.490]  Patreon.com slash vRegulationPod.
[50:57.270 --> 50:58.470]  Be here every Friday.
[50:58.810 --> 51:01.110]  4PM central on Twitch is where we stream.
[51:01.190 --> 51:03.310]  If you're watching the VOD of this, you want to be here live.
[51:03.510 --> 51:04.150]  It's a lot of fun.
[51:04.230 --> 51:04.930]  The chat's great.
[51:05.270 --> 51:06.530]  It's really, like, a lot of energy.
[51:06.750 --> 51:07.390]  It's a blast.
[51:07.610 --> 51:11.530]  And, for the Falcon tier, Septem- September.
[51:11.670 --> 51:12.790]  It's the second time I've done that today.
[51:13.070 --> 51:14.130]  June- Nick, edit that.
[51:14.130 --> 51:23.170]  June 29th at 8 p.m. Central Time on our Discord channel. You can watch AAPW. I'll be doing
[51:23.170 --> 51:28.170]  commentary, but Andrew will be there live. Who else? Who knows? But we'll be watching it together.
[51:28.350 --> 51:34.650]  Check it out. It's gonna be a lot of fun. At official AAPW is where that Twitch stream will be.
[51:34.850 --> 51:38.790]  Yeah, it's gonna be a blast. I'm gonna do my best to make it remotely from Detroit.
[51:39.890 --> 51:45.590]  Wow, thank you. Yeah, and I think we got a Patreon poll coming up soon for deciding what's next to
[51:45.590 --> 51:49.230]  come out. That's right. That's true. Next week. That's why you want to be part of the Patreon,
[51:49.410 --> 51:54.550]  because you influence what's next, what comes out next. So, uh, go subscribe there. Check it out.
[51:54.690 --> 51:58.910]  Uh, really appreciate you guys coming out here and everything. Uh, Nick couldn't be here today.
[51:58.950 --> 52:04.870]  He was very sad, but we had a fun time playing, uh, what's this called? Party Animals? Uh, thank you
[52:04.870 --> 52:10.250]  so much. That's what it's called. Alden Chicken. Yep, for, for joining us. Uh, Geoff, you're gonna
[52:10.250 --> 52:16.730]  leave us, you're gonna leave everyone with some words of wisdom. Uh, save often. Yeah.
[52:17.910 --> 52:22.390]  All right. Okay. When you play video games, save often. Bye, love you, bye.
