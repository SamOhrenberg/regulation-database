[00:00.000 --> 00:03.820]  Got video games, man. They're just as good as ever. I'm so enjoying them again.
[00:04.560 --> 00:08.000]  So we were having a discussion before we started on this guy that
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.460]  the three of us very rarely ever play video games together, just the three of us.
[00:14.680 --> 00:19.840]  Let's do it more. We should. We should do these long full gameplays. I would love it.
[00:19.960 --> 00:25.380]  I would love it. Any three, like every audience, what's a three-person video game we can play?
[00:26.080 --> 00:27.360]  Army of Three.
[00:27.360 --> 00:29.520]  Get ready for it.
[00:31.060 --> 00:36.680]  That was a man. Oh, yeah, what's... what? Does he have a tag?
[00:38.260 --> 00:38.880]  Sir!
[00:40.240 --> 00:43.120]  Yeah, have I got a flashlight or is it just dog tags?
[00:43.840 --> 00:46.540]  Oh, shit! That sounds real bad!
[00:49.020 --> 00:51.240]  Oh my god. Oh my god.
[00:53.960 --> 00:55.840]  You can zap the fuck out of him, Geoff!
[00:56.700 --> 00:57.400]  I haven't! Oh, shit!
[00:57.880 --> 00:58.700]  Ah! Ah!
[00:59.960 --> 01:00.380]  He's dead?
[01:01.980 --> 01:03.240]  Oh, fuck this!
[01:03.740 --> 01:04.460]  Fuck this!
[01:06.180 --> 01:08.220]  Fuck this! I killed like seven of them.
[01:08.240 --> 01:12.520]  Oh, I died. I'll stick around and zap then. I was kind of just like trying to look for collectibles.
[01:12.780 --> 01:16.060]  Do you want to just try to book it? We might be able to just run through this.
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.080]  Yeah, just try running? I doubt that very much, but let's give it a go.
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.340]  Let's give it a go and Geoff will be dead the entire time. He'll just miss this run.
[01:28.130 --> 01:29.450]  I'm running. I'm running. I'm going.
[01:31.550 --> 01:32.510]  Fuck you!
[01:33.650 --> 01:34.450]  Fuck you!
[01:35.530 --> 01:40.610]  Oh, fuck you! They're doing their dances. Fuck you. Oh, oh, they clipped me!
[01:43.290 --> 01:47.470]  Very dead. I mean, that was close. That almost worked.
[01:48.990 --> 01:49.990]  I got through.
[01:51.830 --> 01:56.570]  I blame Gavin on that one. All the way to the end you got through? Yeah, I got past those three.
[01:57.250 --> 02:01.070]  All right, I'll follow exactly where you go. There were like seven cats coming up behind you.
[02:01.770 --> 02:02.130]  Yeah.
[02:02.850 --> 02:03.990]  I'm not worried about what's behind.
[02:05.210 --> 02:05.810]  Oh, no!
[02:06.370 --> 02:07.850]  I accidentally got behind cover. Okay.
[02:08.270 --> 02:11.750]  Well, the reason why I was able to get through is because they hit you and killed you last time.
[02:11.790 --> 02:13.410]  So yeah, that will that will not work at the end.
[02:14.490 --> 02:18.150]  Okay, if you could be a robot, what robot would you be?
[02:20.190 --> 02:20.530]  Oh.
[02:21.830 --> 02:23.150]  I think I'd be a Dalek.
[02:25.170 --> 02:32.970]  That's, they're not really a robot. They're like an alien slug thing. Yeah, but they're like exterminate, exterminate, exterminate.
[02:34.390 --> 02:35.530]  Never really ends well for them.
[02:36.750 --> 02:38.650]  Does it ever end well for any robot, really?
[02:40.790 --> 02:46.370]  Fuck. Bicentennial, man. I guess so. The kid that, the kid at the bottom of the ocean in AI.
[02:48.150 --> 02:49.050]  I never saw that movie.
[02:49.530 --> 02:52.190]  3,000 years later, somebody, somebody pulled him out.
[02:55.310 --> 02:59.630]  Another one. Is C-3PO a cooler robot than he's presented to be?
[03:00.530 --> 03:04.810]  Like, if C-3PO had a different personality, you'd fuck him. Jesus, I don't know.
[03:05.170 --> 03:05.850]  But you're dead.
[03:08.030 --> 03:12.110]  I think C-3PO is pretty cool. Why did Darth Vader not recognize him?
[03:13.490 --> 03:14.870]  I don't know. I haven't seen those movies.
[03:16.070 --> 03:19.470]  He made him. He built him. That's how little he meant to Darth Vader.
[03:20.150 --> 03:20.870]  Somebody's already dead.
[03:22.210 --> 03:24.850]  I don't think the chainsaw approach, Gavin, is working.
[03:25.570 --> 03:27.610]  All right, should we just shoot? Go bullets.
[03:28.050 --> 03:28.630]  All right.
[03:29.110 --> 03:31.970]  I think you just have to get pretty close to one of them to have it spawn.
[03:32.910 --> 03:33.130]  Yeah.
[03:34.290 --> 03:39.410]  I mean this, this feels like it's working. I think we're doing good. Much better approach.
[03:40.650 --> 03:42.170]  Ah, shit. Jammed it.
[03:42.170 --> 03:46.330]  Just keep pushing up. Let's move a little bit and then when they spawn, we'll stop again.
[03:48.830 --> 03:51.090]  Oh, oh, nice one.
[03:55.180 --> 03:56.520]  Geoff with the zap.
[04:02.990 --> 04:07.710]  Jesus Christ. All right, there's about at least four more up there.
[04:11.330 --> 04:14.610]  Oh, I jammed it. I jammed it. Don't jam it.
[04:16.270 --> 04:19.890]  Is that one behind me? What the hell was that? I don't know. All right, here's another one.
[04:22.290 --> 04:23.930]  I mean, we got to be close to done.
[04:25.990 --> 04:28.250]  Uh, I think there's a... Oh, fuck.
[04:30.130 --> 04:32.370]  I jammed it again, Gavin. Look out, look out, look out.
[04:34.030 --> 04:37.430]  Do you have a grenade? I do. Grenade.
[04:39.670 --> 04:41.590]  That might be...
[04:41.590 --> 04:47.050]  That was a good chance for us to reload. Oh my god. Holy shit. There's so many of them.
[04:52.150 --> 04:55.010]  Rude. That's a bunch of dead, wet bastards.
[04:56.110 --> 04:57.910]  I'm really glad we decided...
[04:58.670 --> 05:01.670]  Oh, are we gonna cut them? Oh, no, it's like a giant diverticulitis.
[05:02.270 --> 05:06.050]  Oh, this is what's happening. This is what was happening to my tummy all this week. Oh my god.
[05:07.750 --> 05:08.830]  Are these just hemorrhoids?
[05:09.550 --> 05:11.630]  Kind of, yeah, inside hemorrhoids.
[05:12.430 --> 05:17.410]  They're the goose eggs that all the little pieces of food collect in that make my tummy hurt.
[05:17.410 --> 05:19.270]  Oh, we got a dave door. Oh, is that what a hemorrhoid is?
[05:20.030 --> 05:22.430]  Now, a hemorrhoid's like a little bump on your ass.
[05:23.250 --> 05:25.110]  Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Right where you poop.
[05:25.870 --> 05:27.930]  Let's see. Uh, X.
[05:30.410 --> 05:36.490]  Oh, wow, you did like a whole beatbox thing. Yeah, it's complicated. I'm maneuvering everything with my controller.
[05:37.090 --> 05:40.580]  It's like a thousand quicktime events. You would be amazed. You guys probably could do it.
[05:42.150 --> 05:43.370]  It's probably better than I did.
[05:46.990 --> 05:49.610]  Oh my god!
[05:53.480 --> 05:55.740]  Now imagine if that was covered in icy hot.
[05:56.340 --> 05:57.080]  What a time.
[05:58.060 --> 06:00.640]  Oh, they put in a cutscene for that. You don't worry about it.
[06:01.160 --> 06:02.820]  The buttons are different, are they?
[06:04.040 --> 06:05.260]  I don't like this.
[06:05.260 --> 06:08.080]  I see a boom shot.
[06:08.840 --> 06:10.320]  Oh, it's Marcus Fenix.
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.760]  Oh, Geoff just going straight in.
[06:17.740 --> 06:18.280]  Oh!
[06:19.400 --> 06:21.120]  I couldn't get back up the hill.
