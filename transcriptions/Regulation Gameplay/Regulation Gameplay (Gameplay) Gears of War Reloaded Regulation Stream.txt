[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  How's everybody doing?
[00:02.620 --> 00:05.180]  Let's make sure we're going live and we are here.
[00:06.120 --> 00:06.820]  It is us.
[00:06.940 --> 00:09.480]  How many times was Gears 1 remastered as an outsider?
[00:09.700 --> 00:10.400]  I'm confused.
[00:10.760 --> 00:13.820]  Well, Sonny Sleazer, this is the second time
[00:13.820 --> 00:18.640]  that Gears of War has been remastered, and they did it a second time.
[00:18.740 --> 00:22.160]  I think because this one is going to be on multiple platforms
[00:22.160 --> 00:23.780]  as opposed to the other.
[00:27.550 --> 00:28.370]  Hi, everyone.
[00:28.530 --> 00:31.010]  Happy Friday, says AnnaRue22.
[00:31.010 --> 00:33.270]  Oh, we got spums in the chat.
[00:33.310 --> 00:35.490]  We got we got piss rats.
[00:37.930 --> 00:41.170]  Listen, SpaceGoat007, we got to find out if Ice-T's in this one.
[00:42.450 --> 00:43.890]  I love an Ice-T appearance.
[00:44.250 --> 00:46.490]  Ice-T in a surprising amount of video games.
[00:47.910 --> 00:49.770]  Oh, MadDoctor, the 10 month subscription.
[00:50.070 --> 00:51.210]  Thank you so much.
[00:52.370 --> 00:53.410]  Whatever happened to Coolio?
[00:53.610 --> 00:55.590]  He's dead, is what happened to Coolio.
[00:55.870 --> 00:56.550]  Rest in peace.
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.180]  Hi, Tucker.
[01:02.740 --> 01:04.840]  Oh, man, FungusMonkey, what's up?
[01:04.980 --> 01:05.840]  Oh, we're moving.
[01:06.360 --> 01:07.100]  Thank you so much.
[01:07.220 --> 01:07.860]  I may have missed.
[01:08.020 --> 01:09.140]  Let me see. Can I scroll back?
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.900]  We're at a hype train level 4 already.
[01:11.020 --> 01:11.840]  That's crazy.
[01:13.220 --> 01:14.440]  IckyShuffle35, thank you.
[01:14.960 --> 01:16.120]  GuyW2, thank you.
[01:19.500 --> 01:21.500]  PullTheRatsOut, thank you.
[01:22.260 --> 01:23.320]  FlyMonkey40, thank you.
[01:24.680 --> 01:25.780]  A whole bunch of things happening.
[01:26.580 --> 01:27.240]  Sorry if I missed.
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.600]  First stream, congratulations.
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.000]  Well, we are here today.
[01:30.140 --> 01:31.360]  We're playing some Gears of War Reloaded.
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.820]  Xbox was kind enough to send me a beta code for this thing.
[01:36.140 --> 01:37.160]  I'm really excited.
[01:37.780 --> 01:38.920]  I love Gears of War.
[01:39.480 --> 01:43.640]  As you know, we have a long, long running
[01:44.380 --> 01:48.800]  invincible playthrough of Gears 5 that we're currently putting out.
[01:49.680 --> 01:52.100]  And Gears 1, I keep bashing my mic.
[01:52.200 --> 01:52.820]  I'm doing the thing.
[01:53.280 --> 01:54.760]  I'm recording. God damn it.
[01:55.080 --> 01:55.700]  I'm recording.
[01:56.560 --> 01:58.360]  I'm recording my audio
[01:59.090 --> 02:03.120]  with my mic, as well as wearing an Xbox headset.
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.740]  So I'm sorry if I clink into my pop filter a few times.
[02:07.980 --> 02:10.340]  I'm trying to adjust everything as I double mic.
[02:10.660 --> 02:14.580]  But anyway, Gears of War was a game that I love.
[02:15.780 --> 02:17.240]  It was the thing.
[02:17.400 --> 02:20.480]  Halo was like my first multiplayer shooter love.
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.380]  And Gears of War was my second.
[02:22.960 --> 02:27.160]  And I don't think anything made me angrier as a kid than Gears of War multiplayer.
[02:27.160 --> 02:28.820]  I would get so frustrated.
[02:29.880 --> 02:32.980]  Sponsor stream? No, not a sponsor stream at all.
[02:33.340 --> 02:34.320]  No sponsor from this.
[02:34.420 --> 02:36.800]  Just we got a code for it and I'm excited for it.
[02:36.860 --> 02:38.840]  So I figured I could stream it.
[02:42.560 --> 02:44.740]  This game doesn't come out until August.
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.800]  I believe that's true. Solo stream.
[02:46.920 --> 02:50.540]  Yes, I am the only one available today.
[02:51.080 --> 02:52.320]  Everybody else is out.
[02:53.580 --> 02:56.980]  I don't know if that's a first for a Friday stream.
[02:57.060 --> 02:57.640]  It might be.
[02:58.140 --> 03:01.540]  I think the lowest has been just Gavin and I, maybe Nick and I
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.360]  have done a solo stream.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.340]  Well, that's not solo.
[03:04.980 --> 03:05.880]  You're allowed to stream it?
[03:05.960 --> 03:07.280]  I am allowed to stream it.
[03:07.540 --> 03:08.420]  There is no embargo.
[03:13.750 --> 03:15.570]  Oh, thank you so much, Beeford.
[03:17.930 --> 03:19.470]  Beeford64 for the subs.
[03:20.870 --> 03:24.630]  You need a Bluetooth headset with my dude without a mic for these situations.
[03:25.750 --> 03:26.570]  Yeah, I guess.
[03:27.950 --> 03:30.170]  It wouldn't hurt, but I'm making it work.
[03:30.170 --> 03:32.250]  I think hopefully the audio sounds good.
[03:32.610 --> 03:36.090]  We're recording locally as well, so the VOD looks nice.
[03:38.550 --> 03:41.130]  Oh, yeah, there was a Halo stream by me early on.
[03:41.270 --> 03:41.930]  You're right about that.
[03:42.930 --> 03:44.350]  It's totally a thing that happened.
[03:44.750 --> 03:45.410]  I forgot about that.
[03:46.190 --> 03:49.470]  We did like the they made somebody made like a Call of Duty zombies mode.
[03:53.980 --> 03:56.560]  Love you, Slippy Bunghole.
[03:59.120 --> 04:00.220]  Game is a bit loud.
[04:00.720 --> 04:01.580]  Game audio down. OK.
[04:01.580 --> 04:03.540]  Let me adjust that.
[04:03.960 --> 04:06.680]  We're going to exit matchmaking so I can lower the game audio a little bit.
[04:08.640 --> 04:10.480]  Settings, audio.
[04:12.120 --> 04:13.680]  Let's go three on everything.
[04:14.480 --> 04:15.220]  How's that sound?
[04:16.180 --> 04:18.520]  Is that as loud? Perfect.
[04:18.780 --> 04:20.000]  OK, sweet.
[04:21.720 --> 04:22.900]  Yeah, let's go back in.
[04:23.940 --> 04:25.880]  Downloading latest multiplayer data.
[04:26.440 --> 04:27.840]  Maybe that's why we weren't finding any game.
[04:28.920 --> 04:29.760]  Team Deathmatch.
[04:34.330 --> 04:37.110]  Been loving the regeneration gameplays.
[04:37.250 --> 04:38.410]  Oh, thank you so much.
[04:38.590 --> 04:41.610]  We had so much fun making those, even though they were
[04:42.390 --> 04:44.630]  absolutely brutal at that difficulty.
[04:45.250 --> 04:46.950]  Drop audio one more.
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.340]  How many other people have this game two minutes early?
[04:56.260 --> 04:58.860]  Both man and machine.
[04:58.980 --> 05:00.780]  He's never truly by himself. That's true.
[05:01.720 --> 05:02.700]  Always got Robo Andrew.
[05:06.180 --> 05:07.340]  Hey, Davo.
[05:10.100 --> 05:12.000]  Market, are you going to play against?
[05:16.500 --> 05:18.860]  It's they're currently doing a multiplayer beta.
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.100]  So, yeah, this game doesn't fully release until August, but they are running
[05:23.100 --> 05:27.800]  a beta right now, which I believe is available to anyone who
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.860]  has preordered the game.
[05:30.540 --> 05:34.100]  Like you don't need a code for it necessarily just by itself.
[05:34.600 --> 05:37.560]  And if you bought the previous remaster,
[05:37.760 --> 05:40.780]  you automatically own Gears of War Reloaded, which is nice.
[05:44.590 --> 05:46.970]  Andrew, how much is an issue to eat a pencil right now?
[05:47.070 --> 05:48.970]  Zero zero. There's no amount.
[05:53.520 --> 05:55.520]  Good luck, Andrew. Thank you.
[05:56.920 --> 05:59.020]  Welcome to the chat, Dubber.
[06:05.220 --> 06:07.460]  I'm going to double check that this is fully live.
[06:07.540 --> 06:08.200]  I believe it is.
[06:08.900 --> 06:12.980]  Let's just make sure I'm not just searching the entire time.
[06:14.020 --> 06:15.100]  Just in a lobby.
[06:15.520 --> 06:18.260]  See. Let's see.
[06:26.120 --> 06:26.780]  How are my ankle?
[06:26.820 --> 06:28.940]  My ankle integrity is fantastic.
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.700]  Gears of War.
[06:37.930 --> 06:39.830]  And the beta is live. OK.
[06:45.410 --> 06:47.030]  We're just we're so skilled.
[06:47.330 --> 06:48.170]  It's taking a moment.
[07:01.360 --> 07:04.580]  It looks like a few people and what I'm looking for having issues
[07:04.580 --> 07:05.780]  getting into games.
[07:05.880 --> 07:09.240]  Hopefully that isn't a thing that maintains.
[07:14.830 --> 07:20.110]  That would be an unfortunate to run a beta and then have a bug
[07:20.110 --> 07:24.970]  in which people can't find games is not an ideal situation for a beta.
[07:27.430 --> 07:30.370]  I might close the game in a minute and see if that helps
[07:31.210 --> 07:34.830]  pop on a Reddit, see if there's a solution.
[07:36.670 --> 07:38.910]  Share update, share is fantastic.
[07:39.470 --> 07:41.130]  Do I have a backup plan?
[07:42.010 --> 07:42.790]  Figure it out.
[07:51.590 --> 07:52.750]  And let's go.
[07:59.640 --> 08:01.200]  Oh, we're in a game.
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.080]  It happened. Holy shit.
[08:03.380 --> 08:04.980]  As I was reading the thread.
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.940]  OK, we're going in.
[08:09.060 --> 08:10.080]  Oh, man.
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.000]  Oh, this is.
[08:12.900 --> 08:14.300]  I remember this.
[08:15.300 --> 08:16.340]  Oh, shit. I'm a cog.
[08:16.340 --> 08:17.640]  These are not my friends.
[08:18.160 --> 08:20.420]  Get back, get back.
[08:22.280 --> 08:23.000]  Nice.
[08:24.060 --> 08:24.520]  Fuck.
[08:26.080 --> 08:26.800]  OK.
[08:27.680 --> 08:29.960]  I remember as a kid
[08:29.960 --> 08:34.620]  on the 360, you could do a thing where you could rip CDs
[08:34.620 --> 08:37.860]  and then play the music over the game audio.
[08:38.740 --> 08:39.680]  And I would.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.460]  I had a Billy talent CD and the hives,
[08:44.460 --> 08:46.240]  and that would be my Gears of War music.
[08:46.420 --> 08:48.320]  I would just blast that. This is a problem.
[08:48.760 --> 08:49.920]  That's a real problem.
[08:50.820 --> 08:51.720]  Am I the only?
[08:52.360 --> 08:53.400]  No, I'm not. OK.
[09:01.550 --> 09:02.590]  Oh, this is bad.
[09:03.030 --> 09:04.190]  We're just getting rolled.
[09:06.550 --> 09:07.350]  Oh, man.
[09:10.410 --> 09:12.070]  What are the scores on this thing?
[09:12.830 --> 09:14.270]  5, 4, 1, 2.
[09:17.030 --> 09:18.210]  Oh, you got this, Baird.
[09:20.330 --> 09:20.890]  Oh.
[09:22.050 --> 09:23.150]  Oh, they're in trouble.
[09:23.930 --> 09:24.590]  Where's Dom?
[09:25.410 --> 09:27.350]  Oh, he's screwed.
[09:28.090 --> 09:29.330]  From all angles.
[09:29.530 --> 09:30.110]  Oh, he got one.
[09:30.250 --> 09:33.070]  Oh, he's the greatest player of all time.
[09:33.250 --> 09:33.830]  Until he wasn't.
[09:36.710 --> 09:38.430]  How good are you at wall bouncing?
[09:38.810 --> 09:39.770]  I wasn't bad
[09:40.530 --> 09:42.470]  back in 2010.
[09:43.990 --> 09:44.550]  Now?
[09:45.270 --> 09:45.830]  OK.
[09:50.400 --> 09:50.920]  OK.
[09:51.260 --> 09:52.820]  Let's see if we can get a kill on this thing.
[09:54.940 --> 09:56.020]  I'm trying to remember
[09:56.020 --> 09:59.220]  what the move was back then, or back now.
[09:59.640 --> 10:00.340]  Back now?
[10:00.820 --> 10:03.080]  That is a ridiculous statement to say.
[10:04.100 --> 10:05.040]  What were the tricks
[10:05.040 --> 10:06.480]  back now, aka
[10:07.100 --> 10:07.620]  currently?
[10:10.540 --> 10:11.060]  Nobody?
[10:11.560 --> 10:12.600]  OK, they all went the other way.
[10:17.020 --> 10:17.780]  They're moving
[10:17.780 --> 10:18.480]  as a unit.
[10:20.460 --> 10:21.480]  Let's do a little sneak.
[10:21.560 --> 10:22.380]  Little sneak. Little sneak.
[10:23.800 --> 10:24.220]  Pah!
[10:25.440 --> 10:25.860]  Missed.
[10:26.640 --> 10:28.260]  There's so much blind fire in this game.
[10:30.420 --> 10:31.160]  Oh my god.
[10:31.240 --> 10:32.880]  Somebody invited me to play Gears of War Reloaded.
[10:33.300 --> 10:33.720]  Crazy.
[10:35.200 --> 10:35.980]  We're getting a kill.
[10:37.440 --> 10:38.720]  I'm not exiting this match
[10:38.720 --> 10:39.220]  without a kill.
[10:43.310 --> 10:44.210]  That's my guy.
[10:53.320 --> 10:54.660]  Fuck, I'm losing my active.
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.360]  I just missed it.
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.860]  Come on, come on.
[11:08.740 --> 11:09.300]  Fuck!
[11:10.080 --> 11:11.400]  Every time with that guy.
[11:13.300 --> 11:13.580]  I think
[11:13.580 --> 11:15.660]  pushing them as a group is probably
[11:15.660 --> 11:17.000]  a mistake with the shotgun.
[11:17.680 --> 11:18.620]  I'm gonna swap to
[11:19.320 --> 11:19.880]  Lancer.
[11:24.860 --> 11:27.200]  There we go, there we go.
[11:27.940 --> 11:28.880]  On the board.
[11:36.050 --> 11:36.610]  Damn!
[11:40.320 --> 11:41.500]  Crazy how this looks
[11:41.500 --> 11:43.300]  like I remember it, even though I objectively
[11:43.300 --> 11:45.220]  know that the original doesn't look
[11:45.220 --> 11:47.580]  anywhere near as good. 100%.
[11:47.580 --> 11:49.520]  That is what's so funny
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.400]  about high definition
[11:51.400 --> 11:52.960]  remasters or remakes.
[11:54.060 --> 11:54.700]  Um...
[11:54.700 --> 11:57.300]  It does feel like how you remember and then
[11:57.300 --> 11:59.260]  you go back to it and it is
[11:59.260 --> 12:01.500]  unbelievable how blocky everything
[12:01.500 --> 12:02.020]  looks.
[12:07.640 --> 12:09.000]  Oh, he's smoking out.
[12:10.100 --> 12:10.980]  That was not a good game
[12:10.980 --> 12:11.440]  for us.
[12:14.260 --> 12:14.960]  He's got
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.680]  this. This has to kill
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.800]  like 10 people. There we go,
[12:18.900 --> 12:19.380]  9 more.
[12:21.480 --> 12:22.180]  9 more.
[12:26.450 --> 12:26.910]  Oh, thank you
[12:26.910 --> 12:28.490]  so much Tom the Cow. I'm so happy to be here.
[12:28.950 --> 12:30.850]  Whoa! I'm talking
[12:30.850 --> 12:32.790]  in game. That's horrendous.
[12:32.890 --> 12:34.790]  I'm so sorry. I'm gonna make
[12:34.790 --> 12:36.770]  a party so that way
[12:36.770 --> 12:38.790]  people, random people don't have
[12:38.790 --> 12:40.470]  to hear me stream. That is
[12:40.470 --> 12:41.790]  so embarrassing.
[12:43.030 --> 12:44.390]  That is unbelievably
[12:44.390 --> 12:46.550]  embarrassing. Just talking
[12:46.550 --> 12:48.690]  in game chat like a fucking psycho.
[12:56.810 --> 12:58.470]  There we, we just
[12:59.950 --> 13:00.570]  we're just
[13:00.570 --> 13:02.350]  rolling in. Oh, we gotta go coal.
[13:04.550 --> 13:05.970]  Oh, I got skins.
[13:08.150 --> 13:10.450]  I didn't expect them to just give us a bunch of skins.
[13:11.010 --> 13:11.410]  Oh,
[13:12.850 --> 13:14.090]  we gotta go with the rainbow, right?
[13:15.050 --> 13:16.430]  Let me just look around to see
[13:16.430 --> 13:17.970]  what else we got, but I'm thinking rainbow.
[13:20.810 --> 13:22.390]  Sweaty. There's
[13:22.390 --> 13:23.530]  so many skins!
[13:24.990 --> 13:26.090]  This is crazy!
[13:28.590 --> 13:30.230]  How have I not just
[13:30.230 --> 13:32.470]  looped back yet? I might not make
[13:32.470 --> 13:34.410]  it to rainbow before. Oh, here
[13:34.410 --> 13:36.410]  we go. That's a different
[13:36.410 --> 13:38.010]  rainbow, isn't it? But I like that.
[13:38.010 --> 13:38.790]  That's great.
[13:40.870 --> 13:42.070]  Disco ball, here we
[13:42.070 --> 13:43.950]  go. Okay, we got rainbows.
[13:47.190 --> 13:47.970]  Sticking with
[13:47.970 --> 13:48.570]  this group.
[13:50.630 --> 13:51.670]  Happy pride!
[13:56.940 --> 13:57.260]  Okay,
[13:57.300 --> 13:59.340]  here we go. Let's try to win
[13:59.340 --> 14:01.260]  one of these things. That
[14:01.260 --> 14:01.780]  would be a miracle.
[14:03.480 --> 14:04.760]  What level is this?
[14:08.430 --> 14:09.090]  And if
[14:09.090 --> 14:11.130]  we lose... Oh,
[14:11.130 --> 14:12.450]  it says I'm on a PC?
[14:13.270 --> 14:14.730]  Or no, that's a console symbol.
[14:16.150 --> 14:17.130]  Just a TV?
[14:17.310 --> 14:19.190]  I guess that's a strange way to display
[14:19.190 --> 14:19.550]  console.
[14:21.050 --> 14:23.150]  But I guess in the world in which everything is
[14:23.150 --> 14:24.610]  an Xbox- OH MY GOD!
[14:25.170 --> 14:26.570]  It pulses?!
[14:27.070 --> 14:27.550]  Holy
[14:29.070 --> 14:30.910]  shit! That is
[14:30.910 --> 14:33.210]  way more distracting than I was anticipating,
[14:33.430 --> 14:34.910]  but I kind of love it. It's
[14:34.910 --> 14:35.430]  ridiculous.
[14:38.110 --> 14:38.590]  This
[14:38.590 --> 14:40.890]  incredibly gritty, dark
[14:40.890 --> 14:42.690]  war game, and
[14:42.690 --> 14:44.790]  then just fluorescent
[14:44.790 --> 14:46.770]  non-stop
[14:46.770 --> 14:47.890]  flowing rainbows.
[14:55.310 --> 14:56.310]  Okay.
[14:58.850 --> 15:00.010]  Push, push, push.
[15:00.870 --> 15:01.390]  Nice.
[15:03.810 --> 15:05.110]  We got upper and lower.
[15:05.830 --> 15:06.890]  I don't remember this level.
[15:10.460 --> 15:11.680]  Jesus Christ!
[15:15.570 --> 15:16.210]  Missed
[15:16.210 --> 15:16.910]  the active.
[15:17.810 --> 15:18.790]  Where you running?
[15:21.610 --> 15:21.870]  I'm
[15:21.870 --> 15:22.430]  cold!
[15:23.490 --> 15:24.730]  Nope, nope, nope.
[15:26.630 --> 15:27.710]  Oh, behind?
[15:27.970 --> 15:28.850]  Where am I getting shot from?
[15:29.810 --> 15:30.330]  Oh, lower.
[15:32.310 --> 15:32.690]  Baird!
[15:33.730 --> 15:34.850]  Baird! Baird!
[15:35.190 --> 15:37.530]  I unfortunately ate most of the shots.
[15:40.430 --> 15:41.070]  Oh!
[15:42.250 --> 15:43.290]  Dammit, he had a teammate.
[15:44.090 --> 15:44.630]  We tied.
[15:47.650 --> 15:48.830]  Bring me back.
[15:53.720 --> 15:54.160]  Finally
[15:54.160 --> 15:56.140]  able to catch a stream. Can't wait to play this tomorrow
[15:56.140 --> 15:57.400]  when I get off of work.
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.120]  It's fun so far.
[16:00.400 --> 16:01.900]  It's exactly as
[16:01.900 --> 16:03.880]  that other person said, where it not
[16:03.880 --> 16:05.840]  only looks like you remember in your head, even
[16:05.840 --> 16:08.080]  though this looks way better, it plays
[16:08.080 --> 16:08.720]  like I remember.
[16:09.400 --> 16:10.360]  This feels good.
[16:10.360 --> 16:12.460]  That, that's bad.
[16:12.600 --> 16:14.040]  That's bad. That's bad.
[16:15.460 --> 16:16.220]  That's...
[16:16.220 --> 16:17.320]  Yeah.
[16:19.340 --> 16:20.280]  Damn you,
[16:20.420 --> 16:21.100]  wowzack wow.
[16:26.560 --> 16:27.320]  Okay.
[16:28.880 --> 16:30.180]  Let me turn this around.
[16:30.760 --> 16:31.520]  We got the whole squad.
[16:33.620 --> 16:34.000]  That's...
[16:34.640 --> 16:35.400]  That...
[16:35.400 --> 16:37.780]  Having the whole squad was not
[16:37.780 --> 16:40.100]  ideal. Fuuuck!
[16:41.000 --> 16:41.740]  That was...
[16:41.740 --> 16:42.820]  Oh!
[16:43.320 --> 16:44.680]  I killed him somehow?
[16:45.380 --> 16:47.980]  I think somebody torque bowed me and then it exploded in his face.
[16:51.660 --> 16:53.680]  Imagining the cloud of bits
[16:53.680 --> 16:54.820]  is really funny though.
[16:55.780 --> 16:56.640]  Just the meat,
[16:57.140 --> 16:59.020]  the meat, dust,
[16:59.760 --> 17:00.580]  the meat cloud,
[17:01.320 --> 17:02.260]  super meat cloud.
[17:11.400 --> 17:12.920]  He did explode in my face.
[17:13.020 --> 17:14.760]  I think somebody shot me with an explosive
[17:14.760 --> 17:16.680]  arrow while I was down.
[17:16.680 --> 17:18.340]  And, uh,
[17:18.720 --> 17:20.640]  I blew up in front of him.
[17:25.670 --> 17:26.390]  It is
[17:26.390 --> 17:27.250]  a multiplayer beta.
[17:30.940 --> 17:32.380]  Two downs, one kill.
[17:33.660 --> 17:34.300]  Let's see if we can get
[17:34.300 --> 17:35.200]  two kills, one down.
[17:36.440 --> 17:37.160]  Let's keep on building.
[17:42.400 --> 17:42.840]  Okay.
[17:45.620 --> 17:46.600]  I'm gonna go low.
[17:48.740 --> 17:51.060]  I wish I could adjust the
[17:51.060 --> 17:52.640]  sprinting camera a little bit.
[17:52.640 --> 17:54.200]  It is a little much.
[17:55.940 --> 17:56.580]  Go into
[17:56.580 --> 17:58.680]  settings and see if there's something I can do for that.
[18:07.500 --> 18:08.580]  Is there anyone around here?
[18:09.300 --> 18:09.860]  Are they all up?
[18:15.690 --> 18:16.110]  Okay.
[18:19.010 --> 18:19.930]  Let's loop around
[18:19.930 --> 18:21.570]  and then we can try to get a grenade thrown at him.
[18:29.470 --> 18:30.310]  Boop! Hi!
[18:31.550 --> 18:32.550]  Ah! The camera!
[18:32.750 --> 18:33.330]  Camera flip!
[18:33.330 --> 18:33.470]  Camera flip!
[18:36.330 --> 18:37.870]  Oh, he scared me.
[18:43.970 --> 18:44.810]  Okay, they got a
[18:44.810 --> 18:45.970]  higher position.
[18:49.310 --> 18:49.770]  Shit.
[18:50.910 --> 18:51.350]  Shit.
[18:56.200 --> 18:57.880]  Okay, settings.
[18:58.720 --> 18:59.240]  Game.
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.440]  Extreme content on, on.
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.100]  Camera shake off.
[19:05.420 --> 19:05.720]  Okay.
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.260]  Okay.
[19:07.320 --> 19:09.420]  Let's see if that...
[19:09.420 --> 19:10.860]  Oh, that's so much better.
[19:12.120 --> 19:13.980]  Oh, there we go.
[19:21.800 --> 19:23.200]  Now we're locked in.
[19:24.020 --> 19:24.840]  That's bad.
[19:26.380 --> 19:27.240]  That's bad.
[19:27.460 --> 19:29.060]  Hey, buddy, there's three of them.
[19:42.730 --> 19:45.450]  Oh my god, I'm so bad at the blind fire.
[19:47.730 --> 19:49.190]  Just expletives for
[19:49.190 --> 19:50.430]  our teammate.
[19:50.430 --> 19:50.590]  Alright.
[19:53.130 --> 19:54.250]  Oh, AdmiralChops,
[19:54.330 --> 19:56.070]  thank you so much for all the subs.
[19:58.570 --> 20:00.030]  Oh, this is not ideal.
[20:00.170 --> 20:01.330]  We're just living in our spawn.
[20:04.050 --> 20:04.850]  Smoke out!
[20:07.850 --> 20:09.070]  It fell through.
[20:10.010 --> 20:11.910]  It went through the stairs
[20:11.910 --> 20:14.110]  into the emulsion.
[20:15.390 --> 20:15.870]  Oh.
[20:18.730 --> 20:20.390]  Got plus 9% of that.
[20:20.750 --> 20:21.070]  Hell yeah.
[20:31.280 --> 20:31.760]  Okay.
[20:33.640 --> 20:34.620]  Yup, that was my
[20:34.620 --> 20:35.860]  oh boy, oh boy.
[20:44.170 --> 20:45.870]  I feel like I am
[20:45.870 --> 20:48.210]  doing exactly what they're doing to me in those situations.
[20:48.810 --> 20:50.090]  See, this is as a kid.
[20:50.550 --> 20:52.410]  This is where the rage would come out.
[20:56.370 --> 20:57.730]  Have I finished Clear Obscure?
[20:57.730 --> 20:59.450]  I have finished Clear Obscure.
[20:59.990 --> 21:00.910]  Great game.
[21:02.490 --> 21:03.410]  So much fun.
[21:03.510 --> 21:05.930]  I'm not typically into JRPG style
[21:05.930 --> 21:07.750]  games, but the way that the
[21:07.750 --> 21:08.610]  combat works in that,
[21:09.050 --> 21:11.490]  I really enjoyed, as well as
[21:11.490 --> 21:13.290]  the story is fantastic.
[21:14.230 --> 21:15.250]  Incredibly well written.
[21:28.840 --> 21:31.080]  There will definitely be a mic boop. I'm so sorry.
[21:33.020 --> 21:35.420]  I'm doing my best. I'm trying to get into the
[21:35.420 --> 21:36.600]  mode of bobbing and weaving.
[21:39.560 --> 21:41.540]  It almost always happens when I turn my head
[21:41.540 --> 21:43.640]  to check chat. If I just didn't look at
[21:43.640 --> 21:45.500]  chat, we'd have a
[21:45.500 --> 21:46.620]  zero boop situation.
[21:51.260 --> 21:51.920]  Long time listener,
[21:52.080 --> 21:53.740]  first time chatter, always down to
[21:53.740 --> 21:55.180]  lick cake batter.
[21:57.360 --> 21:58.140]  Welcome to the
[21:58.140 --> 21:58.440]  chat.
[22:01.440 --> 22:02.160]  Still working
[22:02.160 --> 22:03.300]  on Clear Obscure, but loving it.
[22:03.920 --> 22:06.100]  It's great. I had
[22:06.100 --> 22:07.000]  to take a break from it.
[22:07.780 --> 22:10.280]  I played that game non-stop for a while,
[22:10.280 --> 22:12.260]  got stuck on a boss
[22:12.260 --> 22:14.500]  for eight hours,
[22:15.640 --> 22:16.400]  and it really kind
[22:16.400 --> 22:17.300]  of broke me.
[22:18.180 --> 22:20.260]  After beating it, I took probably a
[22:20.260 --> 22:22.240]  two or three week break, and then I
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.980]  got back in, and I had so much fun
[22:23.980 --> 22:25.000]  wrapping that thing up.
[22:28.140 --> 22:28.680]  Congratulations!
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.420]  On becoming a comment leaver.
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.980]  I like that people
[22:34.940 --> 22:36.240]  hate becoming it.
[22:36.540 --> 22:38.420]  I almost have never seen
[22:38.420 --> 22:40.640]  an excited comment leaver
[22:41.360 --> 22:42.440]  initiation, but there's nothing
[22:42.440 --> 22:43.800]  wrong with being a comment leaver.
[22:45.720 --> 22:46.660]  Totally fine.
[22:51.270 --> 22:53.030]  Without spoiling it, what was
[22:53.030 --> 22:55.190]  opinion on the Act 1 finale
[22:55.190 --> 22:55.990]  of Clear Obscure?
[22:59.610 --> 23:01.410]  When Act 1 ends,
[23:01.530 --> 23:03.210]  I forgot that the game was in an act
[23:03.210 --> 23:05.470]  structure. It's crazy.
[23:06.990 --> 23:09.190]  All three acts of that game are great.
[23:11.270 --> 23:13.330]  And I don't think they said that they
[23:13.330 --> 23:15.330]  plan on releasing any more content for it,
[23:15.490 --> 23:17.070]  which, totally understandable.
[23:17.530 --> 23:19.230]  So I'm excited to see whatever that
[23:19.230 --> 23:20.210]  studio does next.
[23:22.130 --> 23:23.510]  It's wild that
[23:23.510 --> 23:25.390]  the core of that team
[23:25.390 --> 23:26.910]  were ex-Ubisoft people.
[23:27.430 --> 23:29.190]  When you look at the current state Ubisoft
[23:29.190 --> 23:31.070]  is in, and just how
[23:31.070 --> 23:33.330]  desperate they are to have something
[23:33.330 --> 23:34.950]  be a mega hit in this game
[23:34.950 --> 23:37.370]  that they couldn't get made in Ubisoft,
[23:38.290 --> 23:38.890]  is
[23:38.890 --> 23:39.830]  independently
[23:41.030 --> 23:42.610]  maybe the biggest game of the summer?
[23:43.270 --> 23:44.890]  I'm trying to think of anything that's bigger
[23:44.890 --> 23:47.210]  than it. It has had ridiculous
[23:47.210 --> 23:47.690]  sales.
[24:00.290 --> 24:01.450]  Oh, that's awesome!
[24:01.610 --> 24:03.810]  I'm glad that us having a Twitch has made it easier
[24:03.810 --> 24:05.470]  for you to introduce regulation
[24:05.470 --> 24:06.350]  to your friends.
[24:08.210 --> 24:09.530]  It's interesting how
[24:09.530 --> 24:11.490]  different people interact with
[24:11.490 --> 24:12.190]  different platforms.
[24:13.350 --> 24:15.270]  Like, I love video games,
[24:15.370 --> 24:17.170]  video game coverage, I just don't
[24:17.170 --> 24:18.630]  watch a ton of streams.
[24:21.130 --> 24:23.050]  But I love watching
[24:23.050 --> 24:25.030]  Let's Play or game analysis content.
[24:25.850 --> 24:27.230]  It's interesting how even
[24:27.230 --> 24:29.330]  within a specific
[24:30.170 --> 24:30.810]  interest,
[24:31.230 --> 24:31.790]  like gaming,
[24:32.890 --> 24:34.970]  or I guess I should maybe say a generalized
[24:34.970 --> 24:37.110]  interest in gaming, that there's so
[24:37.110 --> 24:39.210]  many different forms of content within
[24:39.210 --> 24:41.130]  that, that personally
[24:41.130 --> 24:43.090]  are engaging or not engaging for you.
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.980]  Aw, thank you so much!
[24:49.900 --> 24:51.500]  McStroy, I had a wonderful day.
[24:51.600 --> 24:53.140]  I hope you did too.
[24:58.450 --> 25:00.370]  Wise words from the Herman Miller
[25:00.370 --> 25:02.530]  killer. The Herman Miller killer
[25:02.530 --> 25:04.070]  is such a funny nickname.
[25:13.400 --> 25:15.440]  Man, I love Gears, haven't played in years.
[25:15.560 --> 25:16.980]  Whatever happened to this game? It
[25:16.980 --> 25:17.940]  got old.
[25:19.940 --> 25:20.940]  It's still great.
[25:21.400 --> 25:23.340]  I've played the original Gears
[25:23.340 --> 25:25.060]  not all that long ago. It holds up.
[25:25.060 --> 25:26.680]  It's so nice that
[25:26.680 --> 25:28.840]  they've done this remake of it
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.620]  and it looks great.
[25:30.880 --> 25:31.820]  It feels really good.
[25:34.080 --> 25:35.120]  Classic map!
[25:37.280 --> 25:39.040]  Hundreds of hours spent here.
[25:41.260 --> 25:42.920]  I'm not even going to try to snipe.
[25:43.000 --> 25:43.800]  Let's go boomshot.
[25:45.180 --> 25:46.960]  I'm not seeing anyone else do it.
[25:51.350 --> 25:52.590]  Okay, here we go.
[25:53.090 --> 25:53.450]  Let's go.
[25:54.810 --> 25:55.850]  Let's miss out on some
[25:55.850 --> 25:57.670]  should be incredibly easy kills.
[25:57.990 --> 25:58.930]  They're in a group.
[26:00.050 --> 26:00.530]  Make it.
[26:02.830 --> 26:03.190]  Bam!
[26:04.850 --> 26:05.210]  Double.
[26:08.150 --> 26:09.230]  That's my guy.
[26:10.170 --> 26:11.930]  Let's hide here. Let's do a little peekaboo.
[26:12.670 --> 26:14.570]  Let's do a little peekaboo. We're just going to hide here.
[26:14.690 --> 26:16.210]  We're going to wait for a minute and they're going to run up.
[26:16.370 --> 26:17.130]  Then we're going to go peekaboo.
[26:17.130 --> 26:18.390]  Peekaboo!
[26:20.150 --> 26:20.950]  Fuck!
[26:21.470 --> 26:22.230]  Peekaboo did not work.
[26:22.730 --> 26:25.090]  Peekaboo failed miserably.
[26:27.670 --> 26:28.870]  Get back!
[26:29.910 --> 26:30.490]  Get back!
[26:33.590 --> 26:34.390]  Back!
[26:39.160 --> 26:40.460]  Oh my god!
[26:40.520 --> 26:41.740]  I missed so wide.
[26:47.840 --> 26:48.980]  Let's do another
[26:48.980 --> 26:49.500]  push.
[26:49.500 --> 26:50.080]  Push!
[26:55.060 --> 26:55.640]  Ooh!
[26:59.590 --> 27:00.870]  They are hugging that
[27:00.870 --> 27:01.510]  top mid.
[27:04.230 --> 27:04.810]  Grenade.
[27:07.090 --> 27:09.310]  See if I can get a...
[27:09.310 --> 27:09.690]  Ooh!
[27:15.480 --> 27:16.580]  Sneak around.
[27:20.990 --> 27:22.030]  That's not a sneak!
[27:22.250 --> 27:24.170]  That's not a sneak! They moved with us.
[27:24.870 --> 27:25.390]  Grenades.
[27:41.140 --> 27:42.220]  I got you buddy!
[27:42.220 --> 27:44.180]  I got you!
[27:46.460 --> 27:48.080]  I'm actually playing decently.
[27:48.640 --> 27:50.160]  By decently, I mean
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.060]  I have kills. Let me rephrase that.
[27:54.240 --> 27:56.260]  Now that I've said I'm playing
[27:56.260 --> 27:58.540]  decently, let's do some embarrassing sniping.
[28:05.220 --> 28:05.900]  Oh!
[28:06.660 --> 28:07.680]  That was...
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.680]  Why can't I do that with the
[28:10.680 --> 28:10.880]  truck?
[28:11.080 --> 28:14.700]  I had five seconds
[28:14.700 --> 28:15.200]  of joy.
[28:17.520 --> 28:18.700]  Mic boop. Fuck.
[28:18.800 --> 28:19.200]  I'm sorry.
[28:24.720 --> 28:25.240]  Okay.
[28:27.080 --> 28:27.840]  Let's push
[28:27.840 --> 28:28.300]  in the middle.
[28:29.820 --> 28:30.860]  Get revenge!
[28:31.940 --> 28:33.420]  I can't believe we're still losing.
[28:34.400 --> 28:35.420]  And by a lot.
[28:36.560 --> 28:37.620]  I guess two isn't bad.
[28:38.060 --> 28:39.480]  It feels like a lot in gears.
[28:42.900 --> 28:43.980]  So B is
[28:43.980 --> 28:45.000]  chainsaw.
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.100]  Smoke.
[29:03.910 --> 29:04.270]  Back.
[29:13.940 --> 29:15.140]  I really thought that would
[29:15.140 --> 29:15.540]  down him.
[29:18.840 --> 29:19.200]  Nope.
[29:19.380 --> 29:21.080]  Nope. Nope. Nope. Make it. Make it. Make it.
[29:21.180 --> 29:23.080]  Make it.
[29:24.420 --> 29:25.080]  Okay, were we...
[29:29.120 --> 29:30.500]  Oh, they had two snipers?
[29:31.920 --> 29:32.280]  Fuck.
[29:33.400 --> 29:33.760]  No!
[29:36.580 --> 29:37.460]  The collapse!
[29:44.550 --> 29:45.290]  Oh, none of
[29:45.290 --> 29:47.110]  them are gonna complain. Cause they're not fucking
[29:47.110 --> 29:47.470]  here.
[29:50.130 --> 29:51.430]  If they want to complain
[29:52.110 --> 29:53.150]  in this party
[29:53.670 --> 29:55.150]  that I'm in, they're
[29:55.150 --> 29:55.630]  welcome to.
[29:56.910 --> 29:58.250]  I can send them some invites.
[30:00.290 --> 30:01.150]  I don't want to hear
[30:01.150 --> 30:01.530]  it from them.
[30:05.050 --> 30:06.670]  I am not editing the video.
[30:07.930 --> 30:08.810]  I'm uploading
[30:08.810 --> 30:09.950]  everything as soon as we're done.
[30:09.950 --> 30:12.050]  And then Nick gets back on Monday.
[30:12.770 --> 30:14.010]  And it should
[30:14.010 --> 30:14.930]  be an easy sync.
[30:17.570 --> 30:19.990]  I wonder if the mic boops come through
[30:19.990 --> 30:21.890]  on that. They probably do. I'm so sorry.
[30:23.690 --> 30:25.830]  But from this point forward, no more mic boops.
[30:26.830 --> 30:28.370]  We got 30...
[30:28.370 --> 30:30.390]  31 more minutes of this stream.
[30:31.050 --> 30:31.870]  We ain't booping again.
[30:33.170 --> 30:34.030]  Okay, buddy.
[30:35.010 --> 30:35.830]  I gotcha.
[30:37.710 --> 30:38.210]  A twin!
[30:40.230 --> 30:41.530]  Oh no!
[30:43.210 --> 30:44.050]  That was
[30:44.050 --> 30:44.710]  terrible timing.
[30:46.390 --> 30:47.970]  I'm not gonna be happy until
[30:47.970 --> 30:49.830]  I get one of these up close blind fire
[30:49.830 --> 30:50.570]  shotgun kills.
[30:54.090 --> 30:55.450]  I wonder...
[30:59.810 --> 31:02.030]  I wonder if I have
[31:02.030 --> 31:03.910]  all these weapon skins because
[31:03.910 --> 31:05.910]  it's like, it's reading
[31:05.910 --> 31:07.750]  what I have in different Gears games.
[31:07.750 --> 31:09.230]  Or if they just
[31:10.030 --> 31:11.910]  unlocked a bunch of skins for this thing.
[31:12.110 --> 31:12.590]  Which is cool.
[31:16.460 --> 31:17.880]  Okay, well that...
[31:17.880 --> 31:19.200]  It looked like I threw it.
[31:19.320 --> 31:21.640]  Okay, once again, looks like
[31:21.640 --> 31:23.640]  I tossed that thing. That's me.
[31:24.960 --> 31:25.660]  That's my skill
[31:25.660 --> 31:26.300]  level right there.
[31:26.920 --> 31:27.220]  Show!
[31:31.160 --> 31:31.640]  Revenge!
[31:36.940 --> 31:37.420]  How?!
[31:39.800 --> 31:40.520]  How?!
[31:41.620 --> 31:43.380]  Things were going so well.
[31:50.040 --> 31:51.560]  Use the spawn protection.
[31:55.640 --> 31:56.640]  Sick of you.
[31:58.380 --> 31:59.460]  Once again.
[32:00.760 --> 32:02.100]  Okay, calm down.
[32:02.920 --> 32:04.300]  I'm not really mad
[32:04.300 --> 32:05.820]  but I just saw the door.
[32:06.240 --> 32:08.540]  I just saw the teleporter
[32:08.540 --> 32:10.340]  back to me being 14
[32:10.340 --> 32:11.000]  going...
[32:14.480 --> 32:14.900]  I got you.
[32:21.560 --> 32:22.500]  Try to run.
[32:27.070 --> 32:28.030]  I don't know why
[32:28.030 --> 32:28.930]  I'm still using my shotgun.
[32:34.030 --> 32:35.530]  I think what I
[32:35.530 --> 32:36.270]  need to remember
[32:37.910 --> 32:39.670]  is the last time
[32:39.670 --> 32:40.650]  I played this game,
[32:41.370 --> 32:42.610]  nobody was on PC.
[32:43.310 --> 32:45.650]  This was a 360 only game.
[32:46.470 --> 32:47.410]  And my memory
[32:47.410 --> 32:49.450]  of how difficult certain
[32:49.450 --> 32:51.410]  things are, do not
[32:51.410 --> 32:52.790]  translate necessarily.
[32:53.010 --> 32:55.310]  There's a much greater level of
[32:55.310 --> 32:55.870]  precision
[33:00.970 --> 33:02.910]  on mouse and keyboard setup
[33:02.910 --> 33:04.310]  than what I'm using with the controller.
[33:06.630 --> 33:07.470]  Not that
[33:07.470 --> 33:09.290]  that justifies my
[33:09.290 --> 33:10.930]  badness. I suck, but just like
[33:10.930 --> 33:13.470]  encounters in which I'm fighting snipers
[33:13.470 --> 33:15.270]  or even blind
[33:15.270 --> 33:17.250]  firing. There's just...
[33:17.250 --> 33:19.410]  It's easier to lock that aiming in.
[33:21.410 --> 33:23.230]  See, that's all I want to do, but he just did.
[33:23.590 --> 33:24.570]  I want to get one of those.
[33:27.990 --> 33:29.090]  Oh, controller is
[33:29.090 --> 33:31.750]  way harder, but I...
[33:31.750 --> 33:32.670]  I like it.
[33:35.710 --> 33:37.330]  It's what I grew up with.
[33:37.610 --> 33:39.310]  All of the funky controllers
[33:39.310 --> 33:40.710]  from the N64
[33:42.310 --> 33:43.510]  to the GameCube.
[33:44.890 --> 33:45.670]  I guess GameCube
[33:45.670 --> 33:47.570]  doesn't have all that funky of a controller, but...
[33:49.410 --> 33:50.290]  It's Nintendo.
[33:50.910 --> 33:52.810]  I love doing weird stuff.
[33:53.290 --> 33:54.070]  Level up!
[33:58.320 --> 33:59.720]  What other characters do we got?
[34:00.060 --> 34:02.000]  Let's just go through. Hoffman...
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.060]  Oh! Ice-T's in
[34:04.060 --> 34:06.080]  this thing! I said
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.000]  that as a joke!
[34:07.780 --> 34:09.940]  They put Ice-T in this thing! We gotta be Ice-T!
[34:10.540 --> 34:11.620]  What am I doing?
[34:11.840 --> 34:13.860]  Why didn't I fully search? I made the thing
[34:13.860 --> 34:16.040]  be finding out if Ice-T's in this
[34:16.040 --> 34:17.480]  thing. He's in this thing.
[34:18.040 --> 34:19.700]  Now, is his voice in this
[34:19.700 --> 34:21.780]  thing? I don't know, but that's his character.
[34:22.040 --> 34:23.320]  I guess we gotta find out.
[34:35.320 --> 34:36.160]  I really
[34:36.160 --> 34:38.140]  appreciate Mr. Good Cat trying to
[34:38.140 --> 34:39.880]  diagnose if I am
[34:40.780 --> 34:42.060]  against higher level...
[34:42.060 --> 34:44.180]  Oh, well, I guess I am. But that's not why
[34:44.180 --> 34:45.980]  we're losing. We're losing because we're bad.
[34:46.160 --> 34:47.980]  But yeah, we are against level 9, 5,
[34:48.060 --> 34:48.780]  7, and 6.
[34:50.380 --> 34:52.160]  Which is not an insignificant
[34:52.160 --> 34:54.440]  amount. It's also...
[34:54.440 --> 34:55.560]  Nope, I was gonna say
[34:55.560 --> 34:57.460]  they got a PC advantage, but only
[34:57.460 --> 34:59.560]  one of them does. However, it was the guy that was
[34:59.560 --> 35:01.080]  sniping last time. I was like, wow.
[35:01.240 --> 35:03.460]  They're accurate. So that
[35:11.260 --> 35:11.820]  reads...
[35:11.820 --> 35:13.740]  Yes, the...
[35:13.740 --> 35:14.500]  our community,
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.400]  all of you, are so
[35:17.400 --> 35:19.480]  amazing. The content that
[35:19.480 --> 35:21.400]  y'all produce is
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.520]  always amazing.
[35:22.940 --> 35:25.020]  In regards to what we do.
[35:25.400 --> 35:27.260]  Like those box office summer...
[35:27.260 --> 35:29.460]  If you're watching this and you haven't looked at
[35:29.460 --> 35:30.340]  our subreddit at all,
[35:31.940 --> 35:33.320]  somebody does these summer
[35:33.320 --> 35:35.540]  movie... I'm so sorry, I'm blanking on your
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.560]  name at this moment. But they do summer movie
[35:37.560 --> 35:39.720]  league recaps, which are fantastic.
[35:41.220 --> 35:43.060]  Just all of the additional
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.740]  statistical content that
[35:46.660 --> 35:47.660]  y'all post
[35:47.660 --> 35:49.620]  on there is so cool
[35:49.620 --> 35:50.620]  and so appreciated.
[35:53.100 --> 35:54.340]  Let's see if I can get this guy.
[35:56.740 --> 35:57.700]  Oh! Yeah!
[35:59.320 --> 36:01.560]  Oh! That's 2000... Oh no! The grenade!
[36:01.680 --> 36:02.260]  The grenade! The grenade!
[36:03.160 --> 36:03.520]  Shit.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.160]  I don't think that's Ice-T.
[36:10.160 --> 36:10.720]  At least
[36:10.720 --> 36:13.040]  his character model's there, but that didn't sound like Ice-T
[36:13.040 --> 36:13.300]  to me.
[36:17.060 --> 36:18.460]  That seems like kind of generic.
[36:20.560 --> 36:21.920]  I don't think that's Ice-T. Oh!
[36:22.300 --> 36:22.480]  Oh!
[36:26.940 --> 36:28.700]  I... How am I the only one that died?
[36:29.660 --> 36:30.720]  How am I the only
[36:30.720 --> 36:31.900]  one that died from that?
[36:32.280 --> 36:33.220]  Fuck that.
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.040]  Oh! Get him! Nice.
[36:41.380 --> 36:42.300]  Oh! Yeah.
[36:43.200 --> 36:45.400]  I would highly recommend joining our Discord
[36:45.400 --> 36:47.520]  community as well. It is free, you don't need
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.020]  to be a patron to do it.
[36:49.580 --> 36:51.060]  And it is wonderful.
[36:51.640 --> 36:53.380]  The mods do such an amazing job
[36:54.480 --> 36:55.600]  in making
[36:55.600 --> 36:57.720]  sure that place is the wonderful
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.820]  place that it is.
[37:00.280 --> 37:01.560]  And just, everyone in there
[37:01.560 --> 37:01.940]  is great.
[37:03.580 --> 37:05.560]  So much fun stuff.
[37:09.180 --> 37:10.720]  Okay, miss. Oh!
[37:13.280 --> 37:14.520]  Wait. Wait.
[37:15.700 --> 37:16.220]  Wait.
[37:17.140 --> 37:19.320]  Find the door is...
[37:19.320 --> 37:21.300]  Oh, I am so
[37:21.300 --> 37:21.660]  mad.
[37:23.220 --> 37:25.120]  We have a person on this game
[37:25.120 --> 37:26.840]  on my team named Find the Door
[37:26.840 --> 37:29.160]  and I thought it was like a mission prompt
[37:29.160 --> 37:31.180]  and I was so confused. And because
[37:31.180 --> 37:33.100]  of that, I didn't kill
[37:33.100 --> 37:35.180]  the guy I downed.
[37:37.060 --> 37:39.060]  Take that. Yeah.
[37:40.440 --> 37:41.280]  That was
[37:41.280 --> 37:43.220]  the laziest kill I have ever gotten.
[37:43.780 --> 37:45.160]  You are coming through here I imagine.
[37:46.040 --> 37:46.340]  No.
[37:47.440 --> 37:48.940]  Okay, you are doing your little
[37:48.940 --> 37:50.900]  fucking... Oh boy.
[37:51.620 --> 37:52.320]  I really
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.180]  fucked that up.
[37:58.100 --> 37:59.320]  Leave my guy alone.
[38:09.370 --> 38:09.770]  Bam!
[38:14.040 --> 38:14.440]  Ow!
[38:16.580 --> 38:16.980]  Ugh!
[38:25.320 --> 38:25.940]  I did
[38:25.940 --> 38:27.740]  crack my tooth, but I
[38:27.740 --> 38:28.860]  cracked it...
[38:30.840 --> 38:31.780]  How did I
[38:31.780 --> 38:32.840]  crack it? What did I eat?
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.440]  Was it a nut?
[38:35.580 --> 38:37.040]  I think it was like a cashew.
[38:37.780 --> 38:39.020]  I don't know if a night guard
[38:39.020 --> 38:40.660]  would help me. I don't clench.
[38:41.700 --> 38:43.480]  Typically. At least not that I am aware of.
[38:45.520 --> 38:46.120]  Thank
[38:46.120 --> 38:47.180]  you so much
[38:47.180 --> 38:49.380]  NiceGuyMax for the continued
[38:49.380 --> 38:49.920]  subscription.
[38:56.590 --> 38:57.170]  Well,
[38:57.890 --> 38:58.790]  I had two kills.
[38:59.950 --> 39:02.090]  Something. Oh, we still got
[39:02.090 --> 39:03.890]  bits. We got person
[39:03.890 --> 39:04.990]  bits from the last round.
[39:05.290 --> 39:07.050]  Okay, that's my teammate.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.320]  I wonder if it's
[39:14.320 --> 39:15.840]  just the three levels in here.
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.420]  Not that that's a minimal amount for a
[39:18.420 --> 39:18.680]  beta.
[39:20.900 --> 39:21.780]  Wow!
[39:22.300 --> 39:24.340]  Good shot. Once again,
[39:24.440 --> 39:26.540]  that's the PC guy. That reads.
[39:34.800 --> 39:36.000]  Fuck off.
[39:42.390 --> 39:43.950]  There we go.
[39:51.680 --> 39:54.260]  Oh, sorry Baird.
[39:55.020 --> 39:56.920]  Getting covered my guy.
[40:02.080 --> 40:02.960]  Fuck.
[40:03.160 --> 40:03.880]  Spawn protection.
[40:05.260 --> 40:06.500]  Still spawn protected.
[40:06.500 --> 40:08.020]  Now from the right.
[40:08.560 --> 40:09.140]  Oh boy.
[40:11.000 --> 40:11.500]  Shit!
[40:13.060 --> 40:14.480]  I was hoping I could get a little jump
[40:14.480 --> 40:16.180]  on him with the chainsaw.
[40:18.660 --> 40:20.240]  Does the beta have achievements? No.
[40:20.520 --> 40:21.400]  Does not have achievements.
[40:24.200 --> 40:25.200]  Most things
[40:27.100 --> 40:28.400]  don't give you
[40:29.080 --> 40:30.480]  like retroactive achievements
[40:30.480 --> 40:31.780]  on them, but I will say
[40:32.350 --> 40:34.360]  Towerborn recently came to
[40:34.360 --> 40:36.220]  Xbox. I fucking love
[40:36.220 --> 40:38.240]  that game. And that is a game that currently doesn't have
[40:38.240 --> 40:40.100]  achievements, but it remembers
[40:40.100 --> 40:42.300]  all the things you've done and when they add
[40:42.300 --> 40:44.020]  them, they will unlock
[40:44.780 --> 40:45.860]  for your previous
[40:45.860 --> 40:47.500]  accomplished things.
[40:50.380 --> 40:51.820]  Okay, I can live with a tie.
[40:52.100 --> 40:54.220]  Unfortunately, I don't have a teammate, but I can live with that tie.
[41:05.200 --> 41:07.020]  I would cycle new people
[41:07.020 --> 41:09.040]  so we can hopefully win one of these things.
[41:13.620 --> 41:15.020]  I'm scared with matchmaking.
[41:15.340 --> 41:17.280]  I don't want to get stuck in a lobby again for like
[41:17.280 --> 41:17.860]  ten minutes.
[41:19.720 --> 41:20.600]  So we're just gonna
[41:21.880 --> 41:22.900]  live this thing through.
[41:23.280 --> 41:24.900]  Six kills. That's good.
[41:25.600 --> 41:26.240]  They did well.
[41:29.720 --> 41:30.820]  I see this game has
[41:30.820 --> 41:31.460]  the milk filter.
[41:32.040 --> 41:34.680]  You know what? I mean, I see what you're
[41:34.680 --> 41:36.680]  talking about. If you go back to the old one,
[41:36.800 --> 41:37.720]  oh boy, is that milk.
[41:47.590 --> 41:48.090]  Now it
[41:48.090 --> 41:50.070]  is a public beta, but I do
[41:50.070 --> 41:51.950]  think you have to own the game or maybe
[41:51.950 --> 41:53.630]  be a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber.
[41:54.050 --> 41:56.210]  I don't remember the exact specifics
[41:56.210 --> 41:57.030]  of it.
[41:59.470 --> 42:00.030]  Yeah.
[42:03.110 --> 42:04.050]  So there are
[42:04.050 --> 42:05.950]  some hoops or potential
[42:05.950 --> 42:07.710]  things you need to do to be able to unlock it.
[42:08.450 --> 42:10.190]  It's definitely worth it, especially
[42:10.190 --> 42:10.890]  if you
[42:11.730 --> 42:13.390]  have experience playing
[42:14.070 --> 42:14.790]  old Gears.
[42:15.850 --> 42:17.510]  It's a lot of fun to revisit this.
[42:20.190 --> 42:21.730]  I didn't play the last
[42:21.730 --> 42:24.070]  remaster all that much. I don't know why
[42:24.070 --> 42:25.370]  because I love these games.
[42:25.850 --> 42:27.170]  I guess I probably was just
[42:27.730 --> 42:29.550]  playing something else or
[42:30.930 --> 42:31.970]  sometimes you go
[42:31.970 --> 42:34.130]  in and out of wanting to play everything.
[42:35.370 --> 42:36.390]  I may have just been
[42:36.390 --> 42:37.490]  in a
[42:38.070 --> 42:40.010]  little break from gaming at that point, but
[42:40.610 --> 42:41.510]  this is great.
[42:43.130 --> 42:44.070]  I don't remember
[42:44.070 --> 42:46.230]  Gold Rush. I wonder if that was a DLC
[42:46.230 --> 42:46.610]  level.
[42:47.470 --> 42:49.310]  But all the other maps
[42:49.310 --> 42:51.010]  I have such fond memories of.
[42:55.810 --> 42:56.730]  Oh, that's
[42:56.730 --> 42:57.150]  awesome.
[42:58.270 --> 43:00.010]  Nissa just launched it on 4K
[43:00.230 --> 43:02.370]  PC and it looks great. That's
[43:02.370 --> 43:02.650]  cool.
[43:05.430 --> 43:06.330]  As somebody
[43:06.330 --> 43:08.230]  who cares deeply
[43:08.230 --> 43:09.530]  about game preservation,
[43:10.530 --> 43:12.350]  I know there's like a feeling
[43:12.350 --> 43:14.330]  of, like, just
[43:14.330 --> 43:15.350]  re-releasing something
[43:16.030 --> 43:18.130]  that's already existed, like, especially
[43:18.130 --> 43:20.050]  in movies. I feel like you hear that sentiment more,
[43:20.210 --> 43:22.030]  but I actually really appreciate
[43:23.230 --> 43:24.170]  with games
[43:24.170 --> 43:26.170]  having these kind of classics come back
[43:26.170 --> 43:28.010]  in a much prettier
[43:28.010 --> 43:28.450]  way.
[43:32.070 --> 43:33.590]  Because, I mean, this game came out
[43:34.230 --> 43:36.570]  in, what, 2008?
[43:36.970 --> 43:37.450]  2009?
[43:37.890 --> 43:40.010]  I'm guessing. Was it
[43:40.010 --> 43:41.850]  later than that? I got the 360
[43:42.550 --> 43:44.110]  a little bit later, so my
[43:44.110 --> 43:46.450]  timeline on some of the sort of earlier games...
[43:46.450 --> 43:46.910]  I remember
[43:48.270 --> 43:50.350]  renting this game from a blockbuster.
[43:52.250 --> 43:54.530]  Which is crazy to think about. Oh, no!
[43:56.670 --> 43:58.470]  Because I had to save up to get
[43:58.470 --> 44:00.470]  my 360 and it was also just incredibly
[44:00.470 --> 44:02.650]  hard to find at launch, at least in my area.
[44:03.610 --> 44:04.450]  So, it took
[44:04.450 --> 44:06.630]  me a few years post-launch
[44:06.630 --> 44:06.990]  of it.
[44:09.010 --> 44:10.490]  I guess, whatever the window is,
[44:10.530 --> 44:12.390]  I had it before Halo 3, but
[44:14.190 --> 44:14.590]  definitely
[44:14.590 --> 44:15.350]  not at launch.
[44:16.170 --> 44:18.670]  Anyway, I remember...
[44:18.670 --> 44:20.770]  The first trailer for this thing
[44:20.770 --> 44:22.830]  is so iconic. Seeing that,
[44:22.930 --> 44:24.910]  hearing it was good, and renting it from a blockbuster,
[44:25.130 --> 44:26.590]  and playing it the
[44:26.590 --> 44:27.310]  entire weekend,
[44:28.230 --> 44:29.930]  and falling in love with the series.
[44:33.960 --> 44:36.240]  But it doesn't feel old, is I guess
[44:36.240 --> 44:37.320]  the point I was trying to make.
[44:38.540 --> 44:40.400]  Like, if this just came out...
[44:40.400 --> 44:42.300]  If this was a new game, if Gears 1 was
[44:42.300 --> 44:43.320]  just coming out now,
[44:43.320 --> 44:45.620]  it would
[44:45.620 --> 44:46.580]  feel new.
[44:47.240 --> 44:49.160]  Oh, this is a fun experience.
[44:49.260 --> 44:50.400]  Nothing about this is dated.
[44:57.620 --> 44:58.380]  It's probably
[44:58.380 --> 45:00.240]  stream compression. I bet you
[45:00.240 --> 45:01.180]  it looks a lot nicer
[45:02.640 --> 45:03.540]  on the VOD.
[45:04.080 --> 45:06.240]  I'm just streaming through the app
[45:06.240 --> 45:08.240]  or the built-in console functionality.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.320]  So, it's probably
[45:10.320 --> 45:11.420]  a stream compression issue.
[45:11.860 --> 45:14.500]  On my end, this game looks fantastic
[45:14.500 --> 45:15.500]  and I'm not really getting that.
[45:15.500 --> 45:16.880]  So, I apologize
[45:17.380 --> 45:19.400]  for any compression-related
[45:19.400 --> 45:19.920]  issues.
[45:24.060 --> 45:25.060]  I'm gonna getcha.
[45:25.620 --> 45:26.540]  I'm gonna getcha.
[45:27.000 --> 45:28.220]  I'm gonna miss...
[45:28.220 --> 45:30.740]  I'm gonna miss wildly and not get ya.
[45:37.040 --> 45:38.940]  I was good at this once.
[45:42.830 --> 45:44.830]  There was a time in which I was pretty
[45:44.830 --> 45:46.930]  decent. I almost got the
[45:46.930 --> 45:48.570]  seriously achievement. I got like
[45:49.450 --> 45:50.570]  7,000
[45:50.570 --> 45:52.550]  kills out of the
[45:52.550 --> 45:53.330]  10,000.
[45:54.650 --> 45:56.630]  Oh, that was me. I panicked.
[45:57.150 --> 45:57.750]  That was Locus.
[45:58.110 --> 46:00.670]  Oh, we're so fucked.
[46:02.550 --> 46:04.350]  Is that the Torque Bow in Gears 1?
[46:04.930 --> 46:06.070]  Yeah, that is.
[46:08.890 --> 46:10.510]  What was I gonna say?
[46:10.930 --> 46:12.810]  I almost got the seriously achievement.
[46:13.550 --> 46:14.670]  And then
[46:14.670 --> 46:15.810]  I lost my Xbox account.
[46:16.330 --> 46:17.970]  Because I didn't understand how things
[46:17.970 --> 46:19.950]  worked. As a birthday
[46:19.950 --> 46:21.870]  gift, my grandparents were kind enough to
[46:21.870 --> 46:23.950]  pay for my Xbox Live. And then that
[46:23.950 --> 46:25.910]  card got cancelled. And so
[46:25.910 --> 46:27.510]  then my subscription ended.
[46:27.910 --> 46:29.810]  And I thought that my account was
[46:29.810 --> 46:31.930]  banned. So then I just made a new Xbox
[46:31.930 --> 46:32.270]  account.
[46:33.930 --> 46:35.270]  Yes, dummy, not get a kill.
[46:36.310 --> 46:37.830]  Yeah, well, three of us. I thought,
[46:37.910 --> 46:39.590]  oh, they're definitely insulting me.
[46:40.290 --> 46:42.630]  Which, fair, I guess. But...
[46:42.630 --> 46:43.810]  Not fair, but...
[46:45.090 --> 46:45.990]  It's the whole team.
[46:48.570 --> 46:49.930]  Just making sure that they were on
[46:49.930 --> 46:51.810]  our team and not the other team. It'd be
[46:51.810 --> 46:53.850]  wild if you could text chat with
[46:53.850 --> 46:54.370]  the other side.
[46:56.270 --> 46:56.670]  Okay.
[46:59.410 --> 46:59.890]  You're gonna
[46:59.890 --> 47:01.210]  run out of time with that Torque.
[47:10.400 --> 47:10.800]  God
[47:10.800 --> 47:11.240]  dammit.
[47:15.310 --> 47:17.270]  I'd love to see the regulation crew try DayZ
[47:17.270 --> 47:19.010]  again. Even though the learning curve is
[47:19.010 --> 47:21.210]  so rough. I had a lot of fun playing that with Gavin.
[47:21.210 --> 47:23.090]  It's an old Let's Play
[47:23.090 --> 47:25.110]  video that we made. And by old,
[47:25.210 --> 47:27.010]  I mean... what?
[47:27.430 --> 47:27.950]  2023?
[47:32.000 --> 47:32.680]  It's weird
[47:32.680 --> 47:34.600]  to say old Let's Play video because that channel
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.740]  obviously has such an extensive
[47:36.740 --> 47:38.940]  history. But...
[47:38.940 --> 47:40.680]  In the context of my experience,
[47:41.520 --> 47:42.600]  it's an old Let's Play
[47:42.600 --> 47:42.900]  video.
[47:49.220 --> 47:51.060]  It's active, get the active in.
[47:51.680 --> 47:52.140]  Okay.
[47:52.680 --> 47:54.880]  Well, I'm not gonna be able to take on three
[47:54.880 --> 47:56.060]  of them at... fuck.
[47:59.840 --> 48:00.980]  Didn't even know you guys played
[48:00.980 --> 48:02.820]  DayZ. We did. Gavin and I played DayZ.
[48:04.260 --> 48:04.660]  And...
[48:05.700 --> 48:06.900]  fortunately, Jake
[48:06.900 --> 48:08.220]  who was editing it
[48:08.960 --> 48:10.740]  had quite a bit of experience in DayZ.
[48:11.280 --> 48:12.840]  So they were able to like... they just
[48:12.840 --> 48:15.000]  knew where we were. Because most of the videos
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.040]  Gavin and I try to figure out how to find each
[48:17.040 --> 48:17.240]  other.
[48:20.700 --> 48:21.100]  So
[48:21.100 --> 48:22.960]  it's funny him having played the
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.440]  game quite a bit just knowing
[48:25.320 --> 48:26.580]  where we were and being
[48:26.580 --> 48:28.680]  able to display with an in-game map
[48:28.680 --> 48:30.420]  of the distance between us.
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.740]  I'm gonna get absolutely
[48:32.740 --> 48:33.300]  walked.
[48:38.660 --> 48:39.180]  Die.
[48:39.780 --> 48:40.460]  Thank you.
[48:45.180 --> 48:45.700]  Okay.
[48:46.580 --> 48:48.080]  I can't believe I'm not dead.
[48:50.100 --> 48:50.540]  Woo!
[48:53.740 --> 48:54.260]  Okay.
[48:55.340 --> 48:56.140]  I ain't scared.
[48:56.840 --> 48:58.580]  I should have been scared. I should have been
[48:58.580 --> 48:59.880]  way more scared than I was.
[49:13.300 --> 49:14.680]  We might win this round.
[49:15.080 --> 49:16.120]  Holy shit. Okay.
[49:16.660 --> 49:19.240]  Lock in, Andrew. Lock in.
[49:19.400 --> 49:20.960]  Don't be the reason we lose.
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.980]  Let's get these frag grenades.
[49:24.760 --> 49:25.560]  Fuck you.
[49:28.300 --> 49:28.840]  Okay.
[49:29.480 --> 49:30.900]  I'm pistol off. I'll pistol off.
[49:34.430 --> 49:35.650]  I don't like that.
[49:44.710 --> 49:45.430]  Come on.
[49:46.210 --> 49:47.390]  I'm not dying without
[49:47.390 --> 49:48.110]  throwing these grenades.
[49:50.710 --> 49:51.190]  Yeah!
[49:52.130 --> 49:53.110]  Took him out with me.
[49:53.390 --> 49:55.410]  Can you not grenade stick anymore at the walls?
[49:56.190 --> 49:57.270]  I felt like that should have stuck.
[50:00.490 --> 50:01.490]  Any game you're looking
[50:01.490 --> 50:03.070]  forward to this year? So many games.
[50:03.110 --> 50:05.370]  The Alters just came out. I'm really
[50:05.370 --> 50:06.390]  excited to play that.
[50:08.870 --> 50:09.610]  I'm currently
[50:09.610 --> 50:10.850]  playing Mind's Eye.
[50:12.550 --> 50:13.390]  I have
[50:13.390 --> 50:15.450]  a deep appreciation for weirdly
[50:15.450 --> 50:17.310]  bad games, and I'm having
[50:17.310 --> 50:19.490]  fun exploring the mess
[50:19.490 --> 50:20.490]  that that thing is.
[50:21.550 --> 50:23.370]  What else is coming up? That's good.
[50:25.230 --> 50:27.470]  I'm trying to think. I'm drawing a blank right now, but there's
[50:27.470 --> 50:29.450]  a lot. This has been an amazing year for video
[50:29.450 --> 50:31.770]  games. Expedition 33.
[50:32.090 --> 50:32.850]  The Blueprints.
[50:35.630 --> 50:37.090]  Oh shit. There
[50:37.090 --> 50:37.970]  he goes.
[50:39.930 --> 50:40.830]  A whole list.
[50:41.270 --> 50:43.110]  I can't wait for the Outer Worlds
[50:43.110 --> 50:43.510]  2.
[50:45.470 --> 50:46.450]  Preview for that
[50:46.450 --> 50:48.430]  at the Xbox Game Showcase.
[50:48.590 --> 50:50.750]  It looked great. I really loved the first game.
[50:57.840 --> 50:59.640]  Was sticking not a thing in the first game?
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.480]  Great question.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.020]  I would like
[51:04.020 --> 51:06.000]  to get grenades just to see if I can make
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.440]  something stick, or if it was just
[51:07.910 --> 51:10.060]  somehow I was missing the surface. I could see
[51:10.060 --> 51:11.260]  it not being a thing. I don't know.
[51:12.340 --> 51:14.040]  It just became such a
[51:14.040 --> 51:16.280]  definitive part of grenades in
[51:17.240 --> 51:18.000]  the later
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.020]  games. Feels weird
[51:20.020 --> 51:22.040]  not being able to do it if I can't.
[51:28.420 --> 51:29.340]  Do I have any
[51:29.340 --> 51:31.340]  regulation secrets to drop
[51:31.340 --> 51:33.200]  while the parents aren't around?
[51:34.700 --> 51:34.940]  Oh.
[51:36.360 --> 51:37.320]  Regulation secrets.
[51:40.760 --> 51:41.240]  No.
[51:41.820 --> 51:43.520]  Not really, unfortunately. I'm trying to
[51:43.520 --> 51:45.640]  think of like, what is... is there a secret?
[51:46.260 --> 51:47.480]  I mean, we got... we're working on
[51:47.480 --> 51:49.500]  plenty of stuff that I'm really excited
[51:49.500 --> 51:49.860]  about.
[51:51.180 --> 51:53.560]  I don't know if secret is the right
[51:53.560 --> 51:54.920]  word to describe any of it, though.
[51:55.400 --> 51:57.540]  We recently just released all of the
[51:57.540 --> 51:59.660]  first season of Fuck Face Off on our Patreon.
[52:00.120 --> 52:01.420]  I'm super excited
[52:01.420 --> 52:03.160]  for when we do season two.
[52:04.080 --> 52:05.460]  We've done a lot of the
[52:05.460 --> 52:07.480]  groundwork for it, and I
[52:07.480 --> 52:09.260]  think it'll be a really
[52:10.040 --> 52:10.520]  fun,
[52:11.660 --> 52:13.520]  different way than what we did
[52:13.520 --> 52:14.320]  for the first season.
[52:17.480 --> 52:19.560]  So hopefully that is able to come together soon.
[52:19.740 --> 52:20.880]  It's just, it's...
[52:22.440 --> 52:23.620]  It's been busy
[52:23.620 --> 52:25.440]  this summer. People being
[52:25.440 --> 52:27.480]  away and whatnot, so...
[52:28.340 --> 52:29.480]  Hopefully soon we
[52:29.480 --> 52:31.540]  have a stretch where we're
[52:31.540 --> 52:33.360]  all here for a little bit and
[52:33.360 --> 52:34.560]  put that out.
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.600]  Start releasing season two.
[52:40.760 --> 52:41.560]  Will season
[52:41.560 --> 52:42.280]  two come out soon?
[52:44.620 --> 52:45.180]  Uh...
[52:45.180 --> 52:47.180]  I would say the earliest it could come out
[52:47.180 --> 52:48.300]  is probably July,
[52:49.040 --> 52:51.300]  where it's starting. Don't hold me
[52:51.300 --> 52:53.200]  to that. That could, you know...
[52:53.200 --> 52:55.180]  I'm not saying it's releasing in July, but
[52:56.840 --> 52:59.120]  I would assume the earliest it would
[52:59.120 --> 53:00.040]  start is then.
[53:02.320 --> 53:03.360]  And, uh...
[53:03.360 --> 53:04.980]  Once it starts, it will be
[53:04.980 --> 53:07.040]  a thing where it's like, it's an ongoing
[53:07.040 --> 53:09.340]  series until it's fully
[53:09.340 --> 53:09.920]  finished.
[53:13.680 --> 53:15.080]  Lawyer up upon the
[53:15.080 --> 53:15.800]  end of July.
[53:17.020 --> 53:18.360]  I'll get the lawyers again.
[53:19.860 --> 53:21.120]  Everybody loved the Pencil
[53:21.120 --> 53:22.940]  Trial, so I'll reach out to those lawyers
[53:22.940 --> 53:25.100]  again to make more content that's
[53:25.100 --> 53:26.140]  universally loved.
[53:29.140 --> 53:31.060]  Is that Nick's deadline for the boots?
[53:33.080 --> 53:33.620]  Now...
[53:33.620 --> 53:35.080]  Nick doesn't really have a deadline for the
[53:35.080 --> 53:36.500]  boots, we just need to film it.
[53:39.140 --> 53:40.700]  I push for it all the time.
[53:41.160 --> 53:43.060]  I'm incredibly vocal about us
[53:43.060 --> 53:44.800]  needing to get Nick and those boots.
[53:45.480 --> 53:47.360]  I want to see it. I want to see the content.
[53:57.290 --> 53:58.150]  Well, the winner
[53:58.150 --> 54:00.210]  of Season 2 of Fuckface Off have their name
[54:00.210 --> 54:01.990]  spray-painted on the side of a barn.
[54:03.370 --> 54:04.170]  Like, with the
[54:04.170 --> 54:06.190]  Season 1 winner. We never were able to do
[54:06.190 --> 54:08.110]  the Deputy Indiana thing, although it's still
[54:08.110 --> 54:09.770]  near and dear to our hearts.
[54:10.310 --> 54:12.210]  Obviously. The center of
[54:12.210 --> 54:13.250]  the Fuckface universe.
[54:15.110 --> 54:15.550]  Um...
[54:16.190 --> 54:18.230]  We should... maybe the Port-a-Potty?
[54:18.230 --> 54:20.110]  Maybe we treat the
[54:20.110 --> 54:21.870]  Port-a-Potty like the Stanley Cup.
[54:22.590 --> 54:23.890]  And then you just, like,
[54:24.750 --> 54:26.050]  engrave... and by engrave I mean
[54:26.050 --> 54:28.150]  like spray-paint. Winner gets their name
[54:28.150 --> 54:30.290]  spray-painted on it, or written on it, in some
[54:30.290 --> 54:32.170]  capacity. And then
[54:32.170 --> 54:34.230]  over time it would be funny to just see that
[54:34.230 --> 54:36.430]  Port-a-Potty lined with words.
[54:37.810 --> 54:38.230]  Mic boop.
[54:38.290 --> 54:39.750]  I'm so sorry. That was a small one.
[54:41.110 --> 54:41.990]  I've been very mindful.
[54:42.750 --> 54:43.730]  I'm doing my best.
[54:49.520 --> 54:49.880]  Chef
[54:49.880 --> 54:51.100]  has an engraver from the bats.
[54:51.580 --> 54:53.400]  That's a great point, but I don't know...
[54:54.500 --> 54:55.520]  I don't know if you can
[54:55.520 --> 54:56.620]  engrave a Port-a-Potty.
[54:57.420 --> 54:59.360]  I feel like it would just cut
[54:59.360 --> 55:00.700]  holes into the Port-a-Potty.
[55:01.560 --> 55:03.280]  Which I guess is not necessarily, like, the
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.140]  worst thing, but I don't know. I like...
[55:05.140 --> 55:07.020]  I like preserving the integrity
[55:07.020 --> 55:08.260]  of the Port-a-Potty.
[55:19.320 --> 55:20.360]  Strat taking shots
[55:20.360 --> 55:22.160]  at the Canucks, which is more than fair.
[55:28.650 --> 55:30.370]  We want Port-a-Potty
[55:30.370 --> 55:31.910]  integrity at 100%
[55:31.910 --> 55:32.930]  at all times.
[55:33.770 --> 55:34.390]  I agree.
[55:36.330 --> 55:37.850]  This is probably going to be our last
[55:37.850 --> 55:39.530]  game, because we are near
[55:39.530 --> 55:41.590]  the greatest time of the week.
[55:41.730 --> 55:43.450]  5-0-1 on a Friday!
[55:45.010 --> 55:45.910]  What a time.
[55:46.350 --> 55:47.710]  Let's see if we can get one win
[55:48.450 --> 55:49.290]  this stream.
[55:51.010 --> 55:51.930]  I hope so.
[55:52.330 --> 55:54.150]  I'm so excited to have
[55:54.150 --> 55:55.370]  the guys come back and
[55:55.750 --> 55:57.530]  find time to make a proper
[55:58.170 --> 55:59.450]  let's play of this with the four
[55:59.450 --> 56:00.970]  of us. That'd be a lot of fun.
[56:02.350 --> 56:03.490]  By four of us, I mean
[56:03.490 --> 56:05.430]  I just know the availability of when the
[56:05.430 --> 56:07.510]  next beta window is open and there will be four of us.
[56:07.790 --> 56:09.110]  Hell yeah! That worked.
[56:15.440 --> 56:17.080]  Oh! Fuck. Sorry, buddy.
[56:20.660 --> 56:22.240]  Yeah, I guess sticking was
[56:22.240 --> 56:23.960]  not in Gears 1. That's wild.
[56:23.960 --> 56:24.860]  I
[56:33.720 --> 56:35.000]  just can't win
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.020]  any of those exchanges.
[56:38.060 --> 56:39.200]  It feels like
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.860]  I'm firing with a peashooter
[56:40.860 --> 56:43.040]  and everybody else has super shotguns
[56:43.620 --> 56:44.420]  from, like, Doom.
[56:50.030 --> 56:50.730]  Give me the
[56:50.730 --> 56:52.690]  ammo. Give me my old gun back.
[56:54.250 --> 56:54.930]  Is that
[56:54.930 --> 56:55.950]  up currently, the boomshot?
[56:57.570 --> 56:58.090]  Nope.
[57:00.620 --> 57:02.180]  Oh, we already have it.
[57:02.360 --> 57:02.700]  Perfect.
[57:07.740 --> 57:09.400]  I should try to get a chainsaw kill.
[57:09.560 --> 57:11.240]  It would be a crime to do this
[57:11.240 --> 57:13.060]  whole Gears of War stream without one
[57:13.060 --> 57:13.860]  chainsaw kill.
[57:17.580 --> 57:19.400]  Pull him back. Pull him back.
[57:19.560 --> 57:19.880]  Pull him back.
[57:25.780 --> 57:26.780]  That's a terrifying
[57:26.780 --> 57:28.840]  person. Whatever that
[57:28.840 --> 57:30.560]  asset is, that is scary.
[57:32.980 --> 57:34.640]  It should stay missing. Oh!
[57:34.920 --> 57:35.260]  Boomshot.
[57:38.920 --> 57:40.000]  That is Ice-T.
[57:40.940 --> 57:42.800]  I think that might be Ice-T.
[57:48.700 --> 57:49.360]  Get him.
[57:52.000 --> 57:52.900]  Holy shit!
[57:55.740 --> 57:57.520]  I got Ice-T's voice in this thing.
[57:57.600 --> 57:58.780]  I don't think he did the, like,
[58:00.300 --> 58:01.300]  sounds, but...
[58:01.300 --> 58:03.870]  Okay. This is...
[58:06.060 --> 58:07.960]  Need the spawn timer to expire.
[58:10.640 --> 58:11.620]  Triple kill!
[58:12.320 --> 58:13.140]  Put it on the
[58:13.600 --> 58:13.880]  board!
[58:18.400 --> 58:19.540]  Oh, I wish I had my shotgun,
[58:19.680 --> 58:21.660]  and I wish I didn't fuck up that reload.
[58:23.580 --> 58:25.700]  Maybe I can get a lancer from over here.
[58:28.140 --> 58:29.420]  Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.
[58:29.460 --> 58:31.380]  I'm just trying to get one of these. Don't shoot me.
[58:31.640 --> 58:31.920]  Fuck.
[58:39.340 --> 58:39.620]  Okay.
[58:41.340 --> 58:41.700]  We're gonna
[58:41.700 --> 58:43.760]  win a round. I can't believe this.
[58:47.180 --> 58:48.140]  Watch as we fall
[58:48.140 --> 58:48.580]  apart.
[58:51.080 --> 58:51.980]  Those two just
[58:51.980 --> 58:53.680]  completely clear all of us.
[58:56.600 --> 58:57.320]  Where are they?
[58:59.440 --> 59:00.260]  He's over there.
[59:00.340 --> 59:00.660]  Let's see.
[59:03.060 --> 59:04.120]  Let's see if I can sneak
[59:04.120 --> 59:04.480]  on him.
[59:10.060 --> 59:11.700]  No! I was so close!
[59:12.880 --> 59:13.760]  Oh, I was
[59:13.760 --> 59:15.800]  so close! I was one step away!
[59:20.480 --> 59:21.100]  Get him,
[59:21.280 --> 59:23.080]  guys! Get him,
[59:23.220 --> 59:23.880]  fellow Ice-T!
[59:31.240 --> 59:32.160]  Oh, someone's getting
[59:32.160 --> 59:34.300]  chainsawed. Okay, he was chainsawing
[59:34.300 --> 59:34.780]  one of us.
[59:36.320 --> 59:38.140]  Victory! And I got
[59:38.140 --> 59:38.760]  the most kills.
[59:40.040 --> 59:41.200]  Thank you to the Boomshot.
[59:42.020 --> 59:44.080]  I think I got five. Did I get
[59:44.080 --> 59:45.860]  five or literally
[59:45.860 --> 59:47.780]  all six of my Boomshot kills?
[59:49.160 --> 59:49.940]  Either way.
[59:50.420 --> 59:51.020]  Take him.
[59:52.840 --> 59:54.160]  Let's push the Boomshot
[59:54.160 --> 59:56.220]  again. And maybe
[59:56.220 --> 59:58.320]  I can chainsaw somebody if they also
[59:58.320 --> 59:59.280]  rush to grab it.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.080]  That's probably going to be my easiest opportunity
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.040]  to get one of these kills.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.540]  Yeah, here we go.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.940]  Go grab it. Go get it. Go get it. Go get it.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.640]  Go get it. Push forward.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.520]  Okay, well, my teammate's just going to kill him.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:14.940]  Maybe not.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.180]  Hold.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.700]  Gotcha! Oh,
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.760]  I got you. I was waiting. I was waiting
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.900]  for you. No!
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.660]  You got me.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.140]  Whatever. We got a chainsaw kill.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.040]  We're on the board.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:33.380]  Got to watch out for that sniper, though.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.940]  Let's go back. Let's grab that Boomshot.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.580]  Try to snipe him with it.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.480]  Get our ultimate
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.080]  revenge.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.620]  Okay, they got people up there.
[01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:50.890]  No Boomshot.
[01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:52.370]  Oh, oh.
[01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.830]  Oh, good try.
[01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:56.430]  Okay.
[01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:00.390]  How...
[01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.010]  How did all three of us die?
[01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.030]  How did he
[01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:06.090]  get all three of us?
[01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:09.150]  That was not good.
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.730]  I'll do a little sneak, though,
[01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:13.330]  on the right.
[01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:15.430]  Hey, it's my teammate.
[01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.530]  Find the door.
[01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:17.730]  Hodor.
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.970]  Hodor's brother.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.220]  There we go.
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.510]  No!
[01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.150]  Hey, well, we had a great first round.
[01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:42.930]  Oh, it's 5-0-1! I missed it!
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.150]  5-0-1! Ah! I was locked in!
[01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.870]  It's 5-0-2! I missed
[01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.150]  the 5-0-1! It's the greatest time of the week!
[01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.690]  It's one minute past the greatest time of the week.
[01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.030]  Chat's litting up. 5-0-1.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:55.630]  We're 5-0-2.
[01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:58.190]  Sorry, I was locked in. We're fighting.
[01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.730]  It's tough when you're all by yourself.
[01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:02.530]  But, hell yeah!
[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:06.370]  Oh, no.
[01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.010]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:10.790]  5-0-2.
[01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:12.110]  For me, it's 3-0-2.
[01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:14.910]  Not the best round,
[01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.510]  but we got the chainsaw kill.
[01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:18.610]  It's nothing but up.
[01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.610]  We've crossed the threshold
[01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:23.390]  into the greatest time of the week.
[01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:25.430]  Let's have a
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:26.990]  good final round,
[01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.310]  maybe get a win,
[01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:30.410]  and then wrap it for the day.
[01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:35.050]  Oh, I'm glad you had fun with the stream.
[01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.730]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.550]  Always happy to hear people are having a good
[01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:39.990]  time.
[01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:42.470]  Do a little sneak again.
[01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.410]  Going for it. Am I gonna get...
[01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:46.590]  Am I gonna... Nope. Okay.
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.840]  That didn't get him?
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.160]  I thought for sure.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.220]  There we go.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:02:59.880]  Now he's dead.
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.180]  Get that shotgun outta here.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.940]  Don't mind me,
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.240]  just getting my lancer back.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.040]  Oh, he grabbed the sniper?
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.920]  Bet he did.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.340]  Good job.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.580]  Spawn flip,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.820]  I'm guessing? Sure did.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.180]  Let's post up.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.000]  Fuck!
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.260]  Where you
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:44.480]  going?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.940]  Shit, I thought one of us was up there.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800]  It's all of them.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.920]  And then we got somebody to the right.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.700]  There, really.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:00.600]  Up in the business.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:04.840]  Timing.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.420]  This is a close game.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.180]  Only down by one, we can get that
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:12.420]  back.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:19.980]  Can you smoke? They got a
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.420]  sniper.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.000]  Oh, no.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:24.980]  That's a bad spin.
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.160]  God.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.620]  Oh, it's not
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.360]  looking good.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.940]  This is not
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.760]  looking great.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.080]  This is it.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.600]  They got the boom shot.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.100]  Oh, no. We're out of spawns.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:04:59.980]  That was a great
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.520]  first round.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:01.740]  Flip.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:07.380]  Oh, that does it
[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:07.880]  for me.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.400]  What a time.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.300]  Cross 501.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.060]  505.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.060]  We're down to just Baird.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.600]  Find the door.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.420]  Find the door to our hearts.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:22.080]  Find the door.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:23.640]  The MVP.
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.960]  Oh, look at that smoke grenade technique.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.840]  Oh, and it's the boom shot.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.940]  They exploded into
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.980]  a cloud of blood and guts
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.800]  and love.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.880]  Love for the bandana.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.200]  Love for ourselves.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.120]  Love for 501. Love for all of you.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:42.320]  Thank you so much
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.040]  for joining me in this Gears of War stream.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.700]  I had so much fun playing this.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.880]  I'm excited to play more. I can't wait for
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.040]  this thing to fully come out.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.980]  I haven't played the campaign in a long time. I'd like to do that
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.820]  again. I'm sure we'll make
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:57.120]  content in this. Beyond this,
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.620]  I'm excited to do
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.740]  a full-on Let's Play.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.720]  Maybe we do some campaign stuff.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.020]  I don't know. But either way,
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.300]  thank you so much for joining me.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.740]  I hope you've had a wonderful time with this stream.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.660]  Make sure to check out our Patreon
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.200]  at The Regulation Pod if you haven't.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.880]  It's typically more than just me.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.040]  There is
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.560]  an incredible group of
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.900]  other people that are incredibly funny
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.600]  and that I love dearly.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:24.500]  But until
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.900]  I see you again,
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.200]  have a great time.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.200]  I'll talk to you again soon. Love y'all.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.140]  Bye!
