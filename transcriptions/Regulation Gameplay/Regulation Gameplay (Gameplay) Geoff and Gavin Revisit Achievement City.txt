[00:10.940 --> 00:13.120]  Where's the fucking door? Where's the door in the dorm?
[00:13.260 --> 00:14.400]  The door should be in the middle of the door.
[00:16.440 --> 00:17.120]  Oh, shit!
[00:18.940 --> 00:21.740]  I forgot we built the doors over water because it was the edge of the map.
[00:22.980 --> 00:23.800]  All right, found it.
[00:24.640 --> 00:25.360]  All right, yeah, I see.
[00:28.280 --> 00:30.140]  Oh, I fucking fell in the water immediately.
[00:30.660 --> 00:31.780]  We never built...
[00:32.180 --> 00:33.800]  We never built a platform.
[00:34.040 --> 00:36.120]  A goddamn path on the other side of this door?
[00:37.800 --> 00:39.040]  How do you close a door?
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.580]  Uh, left trigger, I think?
[00:41.840 --> 00:42.360]  Left tri...
[00:42.360 --> 00:44.560]  I love the skill phase.
[00:45.620 --> 00:47.200]  It is such a big door.
[00:48.800 --> 00:50.580]  It's a massive fucking door.
[00:50.660 --> 00:51.660]  Did we really make that?
[00:52.420 --> 00:53.220]  I would assume so.
[00:53.380 --> 00:54.140]  I mean, it was the edge.
[00:54.580 --> 00:55.980]  We did one on every edge of the map.
[00:56.620 --> 00:58.200]  I was gonna say, looking at this door,
[00:58.460 --> 01:02.660]  try to remember that you got paid an entire day's worth of work to make this door,
[01:02.740 --> 01:05.240]  but you didn't because we did all this shit on the weekends.
[01:05.780 --> 01:08.060]  This is when we were supposed to be relaxing and hanging out.
[01:08.220 --> 01:08.740]  We were doing that.
[01:09.040 --> 01:10.040]  Yeah, a lot of these were.
[01:10.200 --> 01:12.440]  So that all the other age guys could relax and hang out.
[01:13.160 --> 01:13.960]  Oh, and this is...
[01:13.960 --> 01:14.820]  Oh, check it out, dude!
[01:15.140 --> 01:16.060]  Little Tower of Pimps!
[01:16.240 --> 01:17.500]  Oh, it's the Hell Tower.
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.280]  Yeah, what game was that where there was like a bunch of fake towers and...
[01:22.280 --> 01:25.980]  I think it was like you had to find the real tower, find the tower, maybe, something like that.
[01:26.560 --> 01:27.340]  What's this right here?
[01:27.360 --> 01:28.640]  God, I don't even know, it's a sheep.
[01:29.000 --> 01:29.920]  This is Nega Tower.
[01:30.220 --> 01:31.420]  Oh, Nega Tower!
[01:31.900 --> 01:36.500]  Man, we had such big plans for Nega Tower, and then we only used it once.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.360]  It came out about right, I would say, at the end of when...
[01:41.120 --> 01:43.580]  Things were just kind of starting to fall apart in Minecraft for us.
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.640]  I mean, fall apart's not the right word, but you know what I mean.
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.860]  We were just kind of reaching the end of it, and we had a lot of cool plans for the Nega Tower,
[01:52.100 --> 01:52.740]  and then we just never...
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.040]  I feel like we both got heavily demoralized by the loss of this world at one point.
[01:59.040 --> 01:59.940]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:00.200 --> 02:02.080]  I don't even remember what happened, but it got corrupted somehow.
[02:02.700 --> 02:04.160]  We did lose this world.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.220]  Oh, I'm going to pop up and see what it looks like.
[02:08.560 --> 02:11.500]  Oh, it's a skull and crossbones. Did we make this?
[02:11.780 --> 02:11.980]  Yeah.
[02:12.200 --> 02:14.560]  Oh, there's birds now? It's like a little parathon.
[02:15.480 --> 02:18.540]  Yeah, I think there's birds everywhere. This looks so good from up top.
[02:19.360 --> 02:21.360]  Yeah, I can't remember if I worked...
[02:21.360 --> 02:23.120]  Because we had different phases of...
[02:23.120 --> 02:26.620]  Like, we would build everything in the weekends, and then we ran out of time,
[02:26.660 --> 02:30.620]  and then we'd enlist other people's help, but then that became...
[02:30.620 --> 02:32.280]  Somehow it took longer to make everything.
[02:32.940 --> 02:33.200]  Yeah.
[02:33.540 --> 02:33.900]  Dang.
[02:33.900 --> 02:37.280]  I don't even honestly really remember what this...
[02:37.280 --> 02:40.620]  I remember the Nega Tower was like a reverse tower, and it had like...
[02:40.620 --> 02:41.080]  Yeah, like you didn't want to block.
[02:41.080 --> 02:43.440]  It came with punishment, as opposed to the...
[02:44.360 --> 02:44.760]  Yeah.
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.180]  It'd be fun to go back and watch those old videos and find out.
[02:48.320 --> 02:49.360]  So what is...
[02:49.360 --> 02:51.680]  What is this version of the world?
[02:52.240 --> 02:54.540]  Okay, so we should talk about that.
[02:54.820 --> 02:56.140]  And what we're doing, right?
[02:56.440 --> 02:59.820]  So you and I got to talk in the other day, and being a little nostalgic,
[03:00.420 --> 03:04.720]  and we're just mentioning how much fun it would be to walk around achievements.
[03:05.260 --> 03:05.620]  Don't...
[03:05.620 --> 03:06.000]  Dude, what are you doing?
[03:06.520 --> 03:08.040]  What the fuck are you doing, man?
[03:08.400 --> 03:09.360]  Is that what that...
[03:09.360 --> 03:10.320]  Is that what goes there?
[03:10.480 --> 03:11.000]  Come on.
[03:11.220 --> 03:12.560]  Put it back the way you found it.
[03:12.800 --> 03:14.420]  This is your world too, man.
[03:14.500 --> 03:15.060]  Give a shit.
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.400]  I've already destroyed the legacy.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.180]  Hold on, I need to...
[03:17.180 --> 03:17.920]  Oh, God.
[03:18.260 --> 03:19.080]  Yeah, go on.
[03:19.100 --> 03:21.100]  I think auto-save is on, by the way.
[03:21.100 --> 03:21.560]  Oh, shit.
[03:22.800 --> 03:24.780]  Let me see if I can change that real fast.
[03:27.300 --> 03:28.200]  There we go, fixed.
[03:28.800 --> 03:31.520]  I'm probably missing it right in front of me right now, but I don't see it,
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.380]  so I'm just gonna leave it.
[03:32.480 --> 03:33.240]  Let's just not destroy stuff.
[03:34.180 --> 03:35.040]  Just be big boys.
[03:35.400 --> 03:35.500]  Yeah.
[03:35.640 --> 03:39.320]  So anyway, we got to talking about how much fun it would be to do just a walkthrough,
[03:39.780 --> 03:42.740]  like a walk down memory lane, kind of, through Achievement City, you and I.
[03:42.880 --> 03:43.160]  Yeah.
[03:43.960 --> 03:45.460]  And so I went back...
[03:45.460 --> 03:46.120]  Oh, wow.
[03:47.220 --> 03:48.160]  Oh, is that Ice Cube?
[03:48.880 --> 03:50.480]  What is this X thing right here?
[03:52.160 --> 03:52.860]  What is this?
[03:54.580 --> 03:55.760]  It seems familiar.
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.060]  Did we make this?
[03:58.200 --> 03:59.660]  Did Matt make this?
[04:00.420 --> 04:02.340]  It's ugly like we made it.
[04:02.660 --> 04:03.560]  I don't know.
[04:03.940 --> 04:07.860]  I remember us being kind of bummed out at how ugly the Four Towers thing was.
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.180]  Remember that one?
[04:10.460 --> 04:11.680]  Yes, I do.
[04:12.220 --> 04:13.860]  So keep going about what this world is.
[04:13.920 --> 04:14.240]  Sorry.
[04:14.520 --> 04:21.780]  So there is a hard drive, a USB hard drive somewhere, that has the original Xbox 360
[04:21.780 --> 04:24.160]  version of Achievement City on it.
[04:24.160 --> 04:25.840]  And I tried to find it the other day.
[04:25.920 --> 04:26.820]  For the life of me, I couldn't.
[04:26.820 --> 04:36.020]  But I did reinstall the Minecraft 1 Xbox Edition, or Minecraft Xbox 1 Edition version of Minecraft,
[04:36.140 --> 04:37.760]  the one that's obsolete now, on my Xbox.
[04:38.040 --> 04:44.300]  And in it, I was able to pull from the 360 a version of Achievement City.
[04:44.700 --> 04:47.600]  The version of Achievement City is just a date in 2017.
[04:48.100 --> 04:49.240]  I don't know the date off the top of my head.
[04:49.340 --> 04:50.500]  I'm not going to shut it down and look at it.
[04:50.520 --> 04:53.480]  But it's like 2-19-17 or something.
[04:53.480 --> 04:55.720]  So it's a date from 2017.
[04:57.200 --> 04:59.820]  I don't know what version of Achievement City this is.
[05:00.000 --> 05:01.240]  I went through the process.
[05:01.360 --> 05:02.700]  It was kind of complicated and annoying.
[05:02.840 --> 05:06.500]  But I eventually got it ported over to this new Xbox Bedrock Edition.
[05:07.060 --> 05:08.760]  I loaded it up to make sure it worked.
[05:09.060 --> 05:09.740]  I called you.
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.520]  You said, don't take another step in it.
[05:11.640 --> 05:12.420]  Wait till we record.
[05:12.900 --> 05:14.080]  And so that's what I've done.
[05:14.700 --> 05:16.160]  I don't know what this world is.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.380]  I don't know at what point...
[05:17.380 --> 05:18.880]  I don't know where we were in 2017.
[05:19.220 --> 05:22.960]  I don't know how involved I am in Achievement City at this point.
[05:22.960 --> 05:25.640]  There becomes an era when I'm much less involved.
[05:25.900 --> 05:27.960]  And Matt is kind of doing stuff in the background.
[05:28.720 --> 05:31.480]  And I lose touch with it.
[05:31.840 --> 05:33.120]  And so I really don't know.
[05:33.220 --> 05:36.240]  But this is, for all intents and purposes, the version we have.
[05:36.320 --> 05:38.840]  And so this is going to be the version.
[05:39.040 --> 05:46.700]  It's crazy that 2017, for us, is like late game Achievement City, this world.
[05:47.080 --> 05:49.200]  And that somehow is like 8 years ago.
[05:49.940 --> 05:50.800]  Somehow 8 years ago.
[05:50.800 --> 05:54.280]  That somehow is 3 or 4 years before we started regulation.
[05:54.500 --> 05:55.040]  Or f***face.
[05:56.860 --> 05:57.420]  But yeah.
[05:57.540 --> 05:59.600]  And also I know there's going to be people that come out and they say like,
[05:59.660 --> 06:05.660]  I have the most perfect, pristine version of Achievement City on my hard drive on PC right now.
[06:05.700 --> 06:07.220]  And I can share that with you guys and you can have it.
[06:07.300 --> 06:08.060]  I appreciate that.
[06:08.300 --> 06:10.480]  But this is what fate gave us.
[06:10.620 --> 06:14.260]  And so for better or worse, as long as this version works, this is the version we're going to explore.
[06:14.620 --> 06:15.120]  This snapshot.
[06:15.600 --> 06:16.320]  So where are you?
[06:16.380 --> 06:17.020]  I've already lost you.
[06:17.020 --> 06:20.740]  That X thing, I couldn't figure out what it was from walking in there.
[06:20.820 --> 06:24.960]  I vaguely remember it was some sort of a contest where you'd get like a weapon and have to fight
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.240]  and like people would come out of the walls.
[06:28.060 --> 06:31.080]  Man, Snowbound was a cool Let's Play that we never did again and we should have.
[06:31.300 --> 06:32.660]  We should have done the Snowbound X.
[06:32.860 --> 06:33.380]  Maybe we did.
[06:33.980 --> 06:34.380]  I don't know.
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.160]  The draw distance.
[06:35.340 --> 06:39.040]  I think the thing that's so weird to me is the draw distance is so much further than it used to be.
[06:39.820 --> 06:40.240]  It's crazy.
[06:40.320 --> 06:41.480]  And it kind of fades in now.
[06:42.260 --> 06:44.300]  It's crazy how much you can see all at once.
[06:44.300 --> 06:50.120]  I like this looks, it feels like I just went to Disneyland like a month ago.
[06:50.180 --> 06:51.620]  This is what it looks like when you look up.
[06:51.720 --> 06:54.940]  Just impossible structures in the distance that make no sense.
[06:55.120 --> 06:56.920]  I don't know if it kind of makes it feel smaller.
[06:57.180 --> 07:00.780]  Like being able to see the Altar of Pimps in the same frame as Dan the Man.
[07:02.060 --> 07:02.320]  Yeah.
[07:02.320 --> 07:04.480]  I feel like that would have never loaded together.
[07:05.080 --> 07:06.780]  It does compact it in some way.
[07:06.840 --> 07:07.540]  Where are you?
[07:07.840 --> 07:08.900]  Oh, I'm walking the back.
[07:09.540 --> 07:10.420]  Is this Snowbound?
[07:11.720 --> 07:12.660]  I bet it's not.
[07:13.260 --> 07:14.020]  I'm on the back.
[07:14.140 --> 07:14.700]  I'm on the door.
[07:14.820 --> 07:16.060]  The bit facing the door.
[07:16.420 --> 07:16.600]  I see.
[07:18.060 --> 07:20.040]  The draw distance on people is still small.
[07:20.700 --> 07:24.620]  You know, I don't want to say this like I'm like, oh, there's all kinds of foos that there weren't.
[07:25.100 --> 07:27.700]  I've played this version of Minecraft with Millie though.
[07:28.220 --> 07:30.940]  Like the last year she was in high school before she went to college.
[07:31.040 --> 07:33.280]  We played a little bit of Minecraft together, made a world.
[07:33.400 --> 07:35.820]  So I'm fairly familiar with current day Minecraft.
[07:35.820 --> 07:44.040]  But there's something really uncanny valley about seeing our old memories in current Minecraft,
[07:44.160 --> 07:44.740]  if that makes sense.
[07:45.260 --> 07:47.340]  Like it feels it just feels strange.
[07:47.680 --> 07:49.200]  You know, it feels not quite right.
[07:49.320 --> 07:52.180]  Some of the textures are different and there's like weird different stuff in it.
[07:52.240 --> 07:56.120]  It's I saw this TikTok the other day that talked about how they're using AI to upscale
[07:56.120 --> 07:57.360]  old television shows.
[07:58.640 --> 08:02.100]  And like there's this TV show you probably don't know, but it's called A Different World.
[08:02.120 --> 08:03.460]  It was on after the Cosby shows.
[08:03.820 --> 08:05.080]  It was like a spinoff of it, I believe.
[08:06.600 --> 08:08.800]  And it was a big show when I was growing up.
[08:08.860 --> 08:12.420]  And I guess there's a HD, like a 4K upscale version of it on Netflix.
[08:12.660 --> 08:14.880]  But it wasn't shot that high resolution.
[08:15.540 --> 08:19.380]  And I guess I saw this TikTok from some dude showing how they used AI to upscale it.
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.820]  And so like the text in the background doesn't make sense and hands are a little weird.
[08:24.220 --> 08:28.740]  And the whole point is it just creates this like uncanny valley that makes it look real
[08:28.740 --> 08:30.400]  but fake at the same time.
[08:30.560 --> 08:31.660]  That's how I feel about this.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.840]  I hate that kind of thing.
[08:32.920 --> 08:37.120]  Because in the end, it's like you have the risk of replacing your memories with the
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.320]  new kind of jank stuff.
[08:38.940 --> 08:39.720]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:40.060 --> 08:41.780]  It's like editing your core memory.
[08:41.960 --> 08:43.640]  Although some stuff's done really well.
[08:43.740 --> 08:48.740]  Like I just bought the whole Seinfeld collection and they like re-scanned all the film in 4K.
[08:48.800 --> 08:49.260]  It looks great.
[08:50.000 --> 08:50.720]  That is very cool.
[08:51.260 --> 08:52.160]  Hey, I'm over here.
[08:52.580 --> 08:53.800]  I think I saw you right behind me.
[08:53.860 --> 08:57.120]  But I'm over here looking down on what I think is AH Labs.
[08:58.020 --> 08:59.200]  Yeah, this is...
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.080]  AH Labs was underused and I'll tell you why.
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.980]  I don't know if we ever really talked about it.
[09:05.060 --> 09:07.200]  But you know why we kind of stopped using it and making it a thing?
[09:07.500 --> 09:11.320]  Because Birdie created RT Labs and it annoyed me that the names are similar.
[09:11.380 --> 09:12.800]  And I was like, I just don't want to use this anymore.
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.480]  And you can see here we were like halfway through testing the concept of the butts dropper.
[09:16.640 --> 09:19.500]  And then I guess BU was enough of proof of concept.
[09:19.580 --> 09:20.660]  And then we just did it properly.
[09:21.100 --> 09:23.000]  Yeah, I think the thing...
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.600]  Yeah, you can see like us testing draw distance with bow and arrow on that platform, I think.
[09:28.600 --> 09:30.920]  And I remember we did a whole...
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.680]  There's a whole, probably in here too, there's a whole mini golf course that we tried to build.
[09:35.860 --> 09:43.200]  Where we were trying to throw snowballs or ender pearls and have them slide.
[09:43.540 --> 09:43.660]  Yeah.
[09:43.780 --> 09:46.420]  And try to like, yeah, but ultimately it didn't work.
[09:47.140 --> 09:50.220]  I assume this was like a TNT cannon launcher thing that we were doing.
[09:50.920 --> 09:51.800]  Probably, yeah.
[09:53.220 --> 09:53.660]  God.
[09:53.740 --> 09:56.500]  Most of the stuff that we made in AH Labs didn't work.
[09:57.920 --> 09:59.520]  But that's what it was for, you know?
[09:59.840 --> 10:02.940]  I think originally as well, because this was kind of close to where we started.
[10:03.040 --> 10:05.860]  We wanted to just start building stuff away from Achievement City because
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.660]  we didn't want to leave stuff all over it.
[10:08.800 --> 10:13.120]  And also it was a giant bomb and we didn't want to accidentally trigger Achievement City
[10:13.120 --> 10:13.780]  while we were building.
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.080]  So we couldn't do redstone anywhere near the main downtown.
[10:19.400 --> 10:20.640]  Hey, look up over here.
[10:21.840 --> 10:22.640]  What is that?
[10:23.620 --> 10:24.100]  The rings?
[10:24.280 --> 10:24.600]  Up in the sky.
[10:24.880 --> 10:25.840]  Yeah, is that pilot wings?
[10:25.840 --> 10:26.800]  Did we make a pilot?
[10:27.060 --> 10:27.800]  Oh, wow.
[10:28.340 --> 10:31.840]  I just said that because it looked like pilot wings, not because I remember that we made
[10:31.840 --> 10:32.780]  a pilot wings Let's Play.
[10:32.920 --> 10:36.420]  But I also think that was before the Elytra and all that gliding stuff.
[10:36.540 --> 10:37.440]  I think we were just falling.
[10:39.800 --> 10:41.400]  Damn, really did a lot with nothing.
[10:41.900 --> 10:43.540]  What's this man?
[10:44.500 --> 10:45.080]  Who's that?
[10:46.400 --> 10:47.100]  I don't know.
[10:47.600 --> 10:55.600]  I feel like a lot of the latest stuff was put in outside the original borders of Achievement
[10:55.600 --> 10:59.980]  City, but I'm seeing a ton of stuff like all this, this water and storm cloud stuff.
[11:00.100 --> 11:00.980]  I don't recognize that.
[11:01.020 --> 11:01.660]  Do you?
[11:03.080 --> 11:05.800]  No, I don't know what the fuck that is.
[11:05.880 --> 11:06.880]  So I guess some round thing.
[11:07.220 --> 11:10.660]  I know that's a Matt Bragg and a Jeremy because we couldn't have built anything round.
[11:11.240 --> 11:11.800]  Yeah, we didn't.
[11:12.180 --> 11:15.600]  All of our stuff was squares and block layers.
[11:16.220 --> 11:17.380]  Is that clouds up there?
[11:18.040 --> 11:19.740]  Oh, could that have been like clouds too?
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.520]  Maybe clouds too, because there's clouds over there and then another clouds and then probably
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.860]  cloud down is somewhere around there too then.
[11:27.060 --> 11:29.760]  And if you're wondering why all of that is at the kind of the same height,
[11:29.860 --> 11:32.260]  it's because that was the original top of the map.
[11:32.840 --> 11:34.360]  Oh, that is something interesting.
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.020]  When I recreated this world and, you know, I had to like port it over it,
[11:38.120 --> 11:40.820]  it asked me if I wanted to increase the world size.
[11:41.660 --> 11:47.860]  And I thought about not doing it, but I decided to, but by world size, I mean height and floor.
[11:48.200 --> 11:51.860]  So everything that was bedrock in this world is no longer bedrock.
[11:51.900 --> 11:53.120]  So we can go below it now.
[11:53.120 --> 11:53.680]  Oh, wow.
[11:53.680 --> 11:54.620]  Which is kind of funny.
[11:55.340 --> 11:57.200]  And it's interesting here to stand here because you can see both.
[11:57.320 --> 11:59.920]  Like this is the original top of the map, the clouds.
[12:00.140 --> 12:06.260]  And then if you look over to the left, we can see your house, which was the second height.
[12:06.520 --> 12:09.120]  That was like the first height increase when we extended your house.
[12:09.900 --> 12:13.020]  It's kind of like when you have a kid and you mark their height in a door jamb.
[12:14.940 --> 12:17.140]  It's like Minecraft world limit raised.
[12:17.680 --> 12:20.960]  This one map is like a ton of little snapshots of all the different versions.
[12:21.460 --> 12:23.400]  Like I feel like we pushed the whole thing to its limit.
[12:23.680 --> 12:24.660]  Where do you want to go to next?
[12:24.780 --> 12:25.200]  Do you want to go and see?
[12:26.660 --> 12:29.720]  Yeah, I want to make our way over towards that weird dude.
[12:29.800 --> 12:30.660]  I also don't want to miss.
[12:30.820 --> 12:31.720]  Is it called the temple?
[12:32.620 --> 12:33.260]  What is that?
[12:33.500 --> 12:34.280]  The big pyramid.
[12:34.660 --> 12:35.360]  The altar of pimps.
[12:35.780 --> 12:36.580]  Altar of pimps.
[12:36.680 --> 12:37.040]  Thank you.
[12:37.140 --> 12:37.300]  Yeah.
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.380]  And this is, I guess, the lower half of cloud down here.
[12:41.500 --> 12:42.300]  Oh, is it?
[12:42.360 --> 12:42.860]  Let me see.
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.780]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:46.780 --> 12:47.380]  You're right.
[12:47.960 --> 12:49.680]  Dude, gold looks different.
[12:49.820 --> 12:50.440]  It's weird to me.
[12:50.480 --> 12:52.500]  The tower of pimps looks a little bit wrong to me.
[12:52.580 --> 12:52.740]  Let me see.
[12:54.380 --> 12:55.820]  Yeah, it does, right?
[12:55.920 --> 12:57.040]  There's more texture to it.
[12:57.240 --> 12:58.780]  Yeah, I bet it's nicer.
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.280]  But because I'm getting old, I feel like I prefer the nostalgic old look.
[13:05.260 --> 13:07.020]  I'm unable to accept new things.
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.180]  Oh, dude, look at the wall tower in the distance.
[13:10.280 --> 13:10.860]  That looks great.
[13:11.020 --> 13:11.180]  I see it.
[13:11.500 --> 13:12.120]  I see it.
[13:12.120 --> 13:13.820]  We could never see that from here before.
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.280]  Let's walk that way.
[13:15.800 --> 13:18.880]  We'll see what this weird dude is.
[13:19.080 --> 13:21.500]  I wonder if that dude is like some version of Operation.
[13:21.640 --> 13:22.760]  Did you guys ever play Operation?
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.400]  Although that would be laying down, I think.
[13:25.720 --> 13:26.960]  I really don't know what he would be.
[13:28.120 --> 13:30.460]  We're gonna have to bring Matt Bragg.
[13:30.700 --> 13:35.820]  If he can avoid all the PTSD of living day and night in this world, we should bring him back one day.
[13:36.500 --> 13:37.360]  Have him explain to us.
[13:37.740 --> 13:38.380]  Explain yourself.
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.500]  What was this thing that I was probably in that I don't remember?
[13:43.420 --> 13:45.440]  Yeah, these parrots are so fucking cool.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.780]  Or parakeets or whatever they are.
[13:46.860 --> 13:48.420]  It's weird, Achievement City is now just...
[13:49.460 --> 13:50.720]  It's like nature's reclaimed it.
[13:50.760 --> 13:52.300]  Like the parrots moved in at some point.
[13:52.300 --> 13:53.860]  You know what it is?
[13:53.980 --> 13:55.100]  It's also kind of like...
[13:55.100 --> 13:58.260]  You know how you have a certain view of your town growing up,
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.400]  and then you move away to London or America, the big city,
[14:01.460 --> 14:03.860]  and you come back and it seems impossibly small?
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.960]  How did the Altar of Pimps seem so much bigger in the past?
[14:08.060 --> 14:08.940]  It's so tiny now.
[14:09.240 --> 14:10.020]  This is the throne?
[14:10.800 --> 14:11.860]  Yeah, this is the throne.
[14:13.260 --> 14:14.840]  That's a great series.
[14:15.220 --> 14:19.760]  It seems like all of the text from the science is missing.
[14:20.300 --> 14:22.040]  So I can't really remember who's...
[14:22.040 --> 14:25.800]  But the amount of blocks on there seems to be like mid-progress.
[14:26.280 --> 14:29.380]  Stuff is still in the chests mid-progress, yeah.
[14:29.540 --> 14:32.220]  Or well, it looks like it's queued up for whatever the game was, but yeah.
[14:33.560 --> 14:34.280]  Unknown map.
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.540]  Oh yeah, do you have a map?
[14:36.660 --> 14:38.600]  It'd be cool to see what the map looks like.
[14:38.800 --> 14:40.580]  Yeah, it's here.
[14:42.100 --> 14:43.220]  I don't think we're...
[14:43.680 --> 14:44.680]  We're not on this map.
[14:44.760 --> 14:46.000]  But you just get to see a...
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.080]  Yeah, I don't think it's the right map.
[14:47.700 --> 14:48.840]  Okay, there's that dude.
[14:49.700 --> 14:50.520]  Should we go and see what that is?
[14:51.080 --> 14:52.220]  Yeah, I don't...
[14:53.420 --> 14:54.440]  Oh, you know what?
[14:55.280 --> 14:57.080]  This was something that I didn't...
[14:57.080 --> 14:59.780]  It was one of the first things I wasn't involved in.
[15:00.180 --> 15:01.960]  It was like I was sick or something.
[15:02.700 --> 15:03.560]  And it was like a...
[15:04.700 --> 15:07.020]  Was it a let's play about me being ill maybe?
[15:07.120 --> 15:09.240]  And you guys are trying to heal me or fix me.
[15:09.420 --> 15:10.540]  Oh yeah, this is somebody...
[15:10.540 --> 15:11.560]  This is Geoff's hospital.
[15:12.020 --> 15:14.060]  I don't remember what the deal with that was.
[15:14.420 --> 15:17.800]  I remember having to come up with this pretty late.
[15:18.020 --> 15:18.700]  Like this was a...
[15:18.700 --> 15:22.180]  I think I was scrambling to make a game at the last minute because you were out.
[15:22.360 --> 15:23.960]  But I don't remember the game.
[15:24.140 --> 15:25.340]  I remember building this though.
[15:25.840 --> 15:26.100]  Whoa.
[15:27.180 --> 15:27.980]  It looks like it's...
[15:28.780 --> 15:30.060]  Yeah, this is...
[15:30.060 --> 15:31.440]  I don't know if I've seen this before.
[15:31.780 --> 15:33.800]  This may not have anything to do with Geoff's hospital, right?
[15:34.120 --> 15:35.240]  No, this is completely separate.
[15:36.280 --> 15:37.320]  This was never here.
[15:37.780 --> 15:39.060]  Oh, this is definitely Matt Bragg.
[15:39.940 --> 15:40.860]  Or Jeremy, maybe.
[15:41.080 --> 15:43.180]  Or some combination of them.
[15:43.260 --> 15:43.960]  Yeah, I don't know.
[15:45.320 --> 15:47.260]  Oh yeah, we put a helipad on the roof.
[15:48.700 --> 15:51.500]  I wonder if I can figure out what this game is just from looking in the chests.
[15:52.580 --> 15:52.980]  No.
[15:53.960 --> 15:55.860]  You can see all four doors at once.
[15:55.960 --> 15:57.340]  That's so wild, dude.
[15:57.660 --> 15:58.140]  Oh, let me see.
[15:58.560 --> 15:59.140]  That's the...
[15:59.140 --> 16:00.560]  This is the borders of the world.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.480]  Dude, this is the whole map.
[16:02.080 --> 16:03.460]  This is the whole world.
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.480]  We would have given...
[16:04.480 --> 16:04.860]  Spin around.
[16:05.220 --> 16:07.960]  We would have given an absolute nut for this back in the day.
[16:08.740 --> 16:12.520]  It seemed so much bigger with that draw distance.
[16:13.480 --> 16:14.560]  It's so small.
[16:15.120 --> 16:16.040]  I remember looking at...
[16:16.040 --> 16:17.020]  Because we made the poster.
[16:17.560 --> 16:19.560]  And I remember thinking, oh man, it's kind of...
[16:20.820 --> 16:21.880]  It's very condensed.
[16:22.080 --> 16:22.580]  But it is.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.980]  It just looks so much bigger when you can see the edge.
[16:25.460 --> 16:27.800]  And also the draw distance back in the day, even on land.
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.540]  The world would load in in those blocks.
[16:30.660 --> 16:33.600]  And it would be so shit the way it loaded in.
[16:33.680 --> 16:37.760]  Like some people would take ages or we would have to like walk into the abyss and wait for the world.
[16:38.060 --> 16:38.100]  Yeah.
[16:38.880 --> 16:40.020]  Yeah, that's true.
[16:40.180 --> 16:40.820]  We have to cut away.
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.300]  You had to do so much cutting away from the game not loading.
[16:43.720 --> 16:44.520]  Oh, I can see that.
[16:45.180 --> 16:46.260]  I can see downtown.
[16:47.020 --> 16:47.620]  You want to go there?
[16:48.460 --> 16:48.740]  Yeah.
[16:49.020 --> 16:49.700]  Or you want to end there?
[16:50.100 --> 16:50.740]  Oh, let's end there.
[16:50.860 --> 16:51.000]  Okay.
[16:51.140 --> 16:51.460]  Let's end there.
[16:51.620 --> 16:51.980]  Wow.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.190]  So this is, I think...
[16:56.980 --> 16:57.780]  What's this over here?
[16:57.860 --> 16:58.240]  Wipeout.
[16:58.540 --> 16:59.980]  This is Wipeout and CTT.
[17:02.200 --> 17:03.080]  Headed your way.
[17:05.240 --> 17:05.620]  Wipeout.
[17:05.920 --> 17:06.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:07.220 --> 17:09.160]  CTT is one of the best things we did, I think.
[17:09.620 --> 17:10.560]  I remember the...
[17:10.560 --> 17:14.640]  I think I've got footage of us in that old living room building this.
[17:15.140 --> 17:15.500]  Really?
[17:15.860 --> 17:18.040]  Of just like a little snippet of us just on...
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.960]  It was on a Saturday and a Sunday.
[17:21.460 --> 17:23.000]  What was this one called?
[17:23.720 --> 17:24.080]  Hotfoot?
[17:26.160 --> 17:27.200]  Oh, what was this one?
[17:27.280 --> 17:27.860]  Something like that.
[17:27.900 --> 17:28.880]  It was a platformer.
[17:31.620 --> 17:33.660]  Could have been a Wipeout X.
[17:35.120 --> 17:38.360]  Didn't we start just playing X at the end of everything?
[17:38.680 --> 17:40.160]  I don't think it was.
[17:40.300 --> 17:41.820]  But I think we did do a Wipeout X.
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.120]  I mean, X on everything, yeah.
[17:43.120 --> 17:45.580]  And by the way, that was kind of an...
[17:45.580 --> 17:46.840]  That was just to make us laugh.
[17:46.920 --> 17:49.220]  That was kind of an inside joke that I think people took seriously.
[17:49.480 --> 17:50.980]  But I just thought it was so funny to do.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.820]  And every time I did it, it got funnier.
[17:53.340 --> 17:54.360]  This is the original...
[17:55.120 --> 17:55.860]  What is this?
[17:55.900 --> 17:56.980]  This is Storm the Tower?
[17:57.100 --> 17:57.780]  This was Storm the Tower.
[17:57.860 --> 18:01.320]  This is the one that we started building, I think, in 2012.
[18:01.640 --> 18:03.780]  And then didn't finish it.
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.680]  Then we both, I think, forgot about the rules of it.
[18:07.720 --> 18:10.480]  And then I think we had Matt and Jeremy finish it.
[18:11.140 --> 18:11.900]  I think you're right.
[18:12.040 --> 18:12.820]  I think you're right.
[18:12.820 --> 18:13.260]  Yeah.
[18:13.640 --> 18:18.020]  I want to see if I can remember all this original Wipeout stuff.
[18:20.680 --> 18:21.520]  Are you going to run it?
[18:21.620 --> 18:22.240]  I'll film you.
[18:22.980 --> 18:23.460]  Oh, God.
[18:23.580 --> 18:25.940]  I don't think I'll do it in creative because I'm just going to come off the ground.
[18:26.660 --> 18:27.120]  Oh, yeah.
[18:28.720 --> 18:30.660]  God, it's weird how small it all looks.
[18:31.520 --> 18:32.700]  What was this last one?
[18:32.820 --> 18:33.500]  Was this Dig Down?
[18:34.200 --> 18:35.760]  This would be Mega Dig, maybe.
[18:35.980 --> 18:36.960]  Yeah, with all the dinosaurs.
[18:37.780 --> 18:38.800]  I think it was a bone.
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.360]  It was like a boner.
[18:42.360 --> 18:43.480]  Do you remember?
[18:43.760 --> 18:44.700]  I think it was Dig Down.
[18:44.820 --> 18:47.900]  What was the one where we were all in our own dig pods?
[18:48.820 --> 18:49.400]  That's Dig Down.
[18:49.920 --> 18:50.740]  That one, do you remember?
[18:50.840 --> 18:52.840]  We had a power cut, like 70%.
[18:53.660 --> 18:54.080]  Where is that?
[18:55.620 --> 18:56.260]  It's behind...
[18:56.260 --> 18:59.760]  Oh, look at that flag on Storm the Tower.
[18:59.860 --> 19:00.440]  That's awesome.
[19:01.140 --> 19:05.340]  Yeah, this is this Dig Down right over here on the other side of Pac-Man.
[19:05.520 --> 19:05.960]  Yeah, look here.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.500]  You can see the old map used to just end at the ocean and then it generated a new map outside.
[19:10.500 --> 19:14.640]  But there's just like a hard cut between the new and the old map.
[19:15.440 --> 19:16.300]  This is it, right?
[19:17.760 --> 19:23.420]  Yeah, so that one, we were like 70% through and we had a power cut which corrupted our audio.
[19:23.540 --> 19:29.240]  And also, we used to record the video in Final Cut Pro 7, where if a frame dropped,
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.920]  it would just delete the entire recording.
[19:31.780 --> 19:37.820]  Yeah, look at the digout at the bottom of this one that somebody did.
[19:38.120 --> 19:40.300]  And these fucking animals just hanging out here all these years.
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.020]  It's cool because we left it finished.
[19:46.340 --> 19:49.680]  We never intended to do it again, so we just left it in its completed state.
[19:50.260 --> 19:52.700]  It's neat to see it as it was used.
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.160]  I remember this is one of the few that I don't think I built.
[19:56.480 --> 19:58.640]  You built it with maybe Lindsay?
[19:59.620 --> 19:59.980]  Okay.
[20:01.160 --> 20:05.620]  And I remember it was very difficult for you both to stay synced up in what you were building.
[20:06.720 --> 20:08.600]  Because you had to make them identical, I think.
[20:09.600 --> 20:11.720]  Yeah, that's a challenge for sure.
[20:13.260 --> 20:14.020]  Oh, man.
[20:14.140 --> 20:15.300]  Oh, this is the wizard's sleeve.
[20:15.620 --> 20:16.440]  Oh, yeah.
[20:19.540 --> 20:22.300]  Which I think Jeremy built around the train track.
[20:22.920 --> 20:26.760]  He did. He didn't tell anybody. He just built it and we just saw it one day.
[20:27.180 --> 20:31.600]  This is the era where we would just put stuff on a board and you had to go make it.
[20:31.920 --> 20:35.080]  Those ones were so simple to come up with and build,
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.700]  but I think those are some of the best ones.
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.240]  I remember wool being so fun.
[20:39.700 --> 20:41.020]  The collectible ones, yeah.
[20:41.300 --> 20:42.380]  Yeah, so this was wool.
[20:43.300 --> 20:46.780]  And then the way we morphed into after we figured out how to collect everything that we could,
[20:46.880 --> 20:49.740]  we did like petting zoo, heavy petting zoo, all these...
[20:49.740 --> 20:50.260]  No petting zoo.
[20:50.280 --> 20:51.380]  No petting zoo, that's what it was.
[20:51.680 --> 20:55.580]  Then we just did like Minecraft 1.79 appreciation update.
[20:55.780 --> 20:58.140]  And we would just do a collection of the new shit that dropped.
[20:58.340 --> 20:59.580]  Which was actually kind of like...
[21:00.720 --> 21:04.220]  We were just doing it for the fun because we were like, oh, there's new stuff we could do.
[21:04.220 --> 21:07.620]  But they also kind of played a role in like, here's what's new in Minecraft.
[21:08.280 --> 21:08.680]  Yeah.
[21:09.400 --> 21:13.320]  Yeah, this one was also starting to run out of ideas, but it didn't matter.
[21:13.820 --> 21:14.380]  It was fun.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.280]  Dude, this wool tower is so cool.
[21:17.540 --> 21:19.140]  And that's just burnt up.
[21:19.400 --> 21:21.160]  We lit a fire in it and that's what happened.
[21:21.700 --> 21:22.800]  I think so.
[21:22.940 --> 21:23.300]  I don't remember.
[21:23.300 --> 21:23.960]  I think you're like...
[21:23.960 --> 21:24.640]  I don't remember what the...
[21:25.380 --> 21:28.540]  I mean, I guess they must have been trying to find the pieces of the real tower in there.
[21:28.820 --> 21:32.700]  Yeah, I think originally we were like mining our way through it and then we burnt it.
[21:32.700 --> 21:36.940]  I can't remember if it was on purpose, but it just looks super cool because it was like a natural...
[21:37.860 --> 21:39.480]  Like you couldn't build it like that easily.
[21:39.920 --> 21:40.100]  Yeah.
[21:40.380 --> 21:42.040]  What are these ones here?
[21:42.180 --> 21:43.760]  This is like a shopping list of some sort.
[21:43.860 --> 21:44.300]  What's this?
[21:45.020 --> 21:47.280]  Are you the stuff down at the bottom where wool is?
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.580]  This must have been an update or something.
[21:49.720 --> 21:52.080]  Or like a block shopping list.
[21:52.480 --> 21:53.140]  Blocking list?
[21:55.240 --> 21:56.320]  Uh, let's see.
[21:56.480 --> 21:56.800]  We got...
[21:59.300 --> 22:00.800]  This is definitely an update.
[22:01.600 --> 22:02.260]  Is it?
[22:03.340 --> 22:05.440]  Yeah, because all that looks like new stuff.
[22:05.720 --> 22:06.700]  Yeah, this is new shit.
[22:06.820 --> 22:07.560]  That's an update.
[22:08.760 --> 22:09.980]  And then this one is...
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.480]  Blocking list?
[22:12.800 --> 22:13.620]  Is that what that's called?
[22:13.840 --> 22:14.220]  I don't know.
[22:14.320 --> 22:14.540]  I don't think it is.
[22:14.760 --> 22:16.220]  I wish the signs were still there.
[22:16.620 --> 22:17.420]  And what's this one?
[22:19.240 --> 22:19.660]  Oh.
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.400]  This one looks advanced.
[22:24.720 --> 22:26.960]  I don't think I had anything to do with this one.
[22:27.760 --> 22:29.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[22:29.640 --> 22:30.530]  It might just be like a...
[22:31.870 --> 22:32.910]  Bingo or something?
[22:33.130 --> 22:33.850]  I don't know.
[22:34.590 --> 22:36.530]  What the fuck is that?
[22:36.790 --> 22:37.070]  What?
[22:38.350 --> 22:38.790]  Frogs?
[22:41.510 --> 22:42.910]  Are you fucking serious?
[22:42.910 --> 22:43.790]  Are you seeing this?
[22:44.270 --> 22:45.570]  They're like giant frogs.
[22:45.830 --> 22:46.770]  They like poke their fucking throats out.
[22:46.770 --> 22:47.410]  Oh, I walked past one of these.
[22:47.490 --> 22:49.210]  I just didn't even take a...
[22:49.210 --> 22:50.250]  What the goddamn?
[22:50.930 --> 22:51.510]  Can you eat them?
[22:52.230 --> 22:53.130]  I don't know.
[22:53.270 --> 22:56.270]  I've been playing Minecraft the last couple years and I haven't seen these.
[22:56.330 --> 22:57.250]  These must be pretty new.
[22:58.390 --> 22:59.510]  I want to eat frog meat.
[23:02.090 --> 23:03.730]  What the fuck, dude?
[23:03.790 --> 23:04.030]  I'm sorry.
[23:04.110 --> 23:05.470]  That scared the shit out of me.
[23:08.550 --> 23:10.310]  I guess I got frogs now.
[23:11.450 --> 23:13.210]  Oh, look at the swamps out here.
[23:13.390 --> 23:13.930]  Right outside.
[23:14.050 --> 23:14.650]  That's cool.
[23:16.270 --> 23:17.150]  So then...
[23:17.150 --> 23:22.390]  Because this is a 2017 version, we built outside of these boundaries.
[23:22.570 --> 23:23.870]  So there's stuff out there too.
[23:24.410 --> 23:24.610]  Yeah.
[23:25.450 --> 23:28.190]  And it would mostly be Matt and Jeremy's stuff.
[23:28.250 --> 23:30.090]  Although there would be some stuff we built as well.
[23:30.090 --> 23:33.030]  Do you remember when we had that meeting with Matt and Jeremy when they first started?
[23:33.150 --> 23:37.710]  And we were like, get out there and just put stuff in the world.
[23:37.790 --> 23:38.510]  We want to find like...
[23:39.670 --> 23:41.050]  I think we had some suggestions.
[23:41.270 --> 23:43.010]  We want to find like dinosaur bones.
[23:43.210 --> 23:45.150]  We want to find the fake moon landing.
[23:46.010 --> 23:48.150]  Jeremy was going to put El Dorado out there somewhere.
[23:48.430 --> 23:49.790]  Yeah, exactly like that.
[23:49.930 --> 23:51.170]  We just want to be like, what the fuck?
[23:51.430 --> 23:54.250]  I'm not sure if we don't want to know anything about it.
[23:54.530 --> 23:57.850]  Jeremy built that whole underwater glass tank thing.
[23:58.330 --> 24:00.590]  Did that ever turn into a video?
[24:01.430 --> 24:05.230]  I know that we found it in a video in one of the fishing jamborees.
[24:05.570 --> 24:06.330]  Look at the cactus.
[24:06.470 --> 24:07.470]  That looks completely different.
[24:08.570 --> 24:09.430]  I'm in CTT.
[24:10.110 --> 24:11.830]  Oh, let me come over to you.
[24:12.150 --> 24:12.690]  I'll be there in a second.
[24:12.870 --> 24:15.070]  So CTTX, it doesn't look like we changed the map.
[24:15.290 --> 24:16.770]  Dude, find the tower.
[24:17.010 --> 24:17.650]  Here it is.
[24:18.170 --> 24:20.310]  God, I remember hiding it so well.
[24:20.510 --> 24:22.790]  I think it would be impossible for you guys to get it.
[24:24.630 --> 24:25.430]  It's amazing.
[24:25.430 --> 24:28.090]  Oh, that was the original find the tower?
[24:28.730 --> 24:29.630]  Yeah, I think so, right?
[24:29.910 --> 24:30.690]  Or maybe... yeah.
[24:30.970 --> 24:32.190]  Well, there was one... yeah.
[24:32.350 --> 24:33.190]  Yeah, this was find the tower.
[24:33.290 --> 24:34.030]  The other one was find Geoff.
[24:34.230 --> 24:34.430]  Yeah.
[24:36.030 --> 24:38.510]  Didn't you also put one way up in the sky or something?
[24:38.530 --> 24:40.250]  That was find Geoff, I think.
[24:40.470 --> 24:40.750]  Okay.
[24:40.810 --> 24:41.970]  I was hiding in a cloud.
[24:43.350 --> 24:43.610]  Yeah.
[24:44.690 --> 24:45.610]  God, it was crazy.
[24:45.830 --> 24:48.670]  Like, during the main popularity of Let's Play Minecraft,
[24:49.490 --> 24:53.550]  I had the craziest interactions with people out in public.
[24:53.550 --> 24:57.650]  I was in Heathrow Airport and someone recognized me.
[24:58.550 --> 24:59.830]  They were like, really happy to see me.
[24:59.930 --> 25:00.990]  And then they were like, oh, wait.
[25:01.570 --> 25:03.570]  Does this mean you're not going to be in Minecraft on Friday?
[25:04.350 --> 25:05.290]  Because I was in England.
[25:05.470 --> 25:07.230]  And I was like, no, don't worry, we pre-filmed it.
[25:07.670 --> 25:08.110]  And he was like, oh.
[25:09.170 --> 25:10.050]  That's really funny.
[25:10.290 --> 25:11.130]  Oh, here's the credits.
[25:11.410 --> 25:12.670]  Oh, episode 100 credits.
[25:13.030 --> 25:13.850]  That was a cool idea.
[25:14.350 --> 25:15.550]  Oh, I loved making that.
[25:16.250 --> 25:17.450]  So was this as well?
[25:17.450 --> 25:19.130]  Was this also before creative mode?
[25:19.170 --> 25:21.410]  Because we've built a ladder to film it, I think.
[25:22.050 --> 25:26.370]  No, what the ladder was for was to put our back against.
[25:26.950 --> 25:28.370]  So we could go straight down.
[25:29.070 --> 25:29.370]  You're right.
[25:29.830 --> 25:30.610]  I'm pretty sure.
[25:30.910 --> 25:31.790]  I think we had creative mode.
[25:31.950 --> 25:33.930]  So we had creative mode by the time we were finished with my house.
[25:33.950 --> 25:34.690]  Here's Dig Dug.
[25:35.230 --> 25:36.990]  Dude, that's so cool looking.
[25:37.410 --> 25:40.870]  And there's Thread the Needle over there by Megadig.
[25:41.370 --> 25:42.010]  This is Hot...
[25:43.190 --> 25:44.130]  No, what is that?
[25:44.190 --> 25:47.070]  Hot Hoof or something like that.
[25:49.210 --> 25:49.650]  Wow.
[25:51.610 --> 25:53.750]  I know it's dumb and all, but it's just neat.
[25:54.850 --> 25:56.510]  Oh, look, I love this.
[25:56.750 --> 25:58.790]  We've made an outlet for it.
[26:00.170 --> 26:01.250]  Oh, yeah, we did.
[26:01.650 --> 26:02.590]  It's plugged in.
[26:04.130 --> 26:05.670]  It's still got power after all these years.
[26:05.930 --> 26:07.210]  That means our high score should still be there.
[26:08.330 --> 26:09.490]  Oh, what was this?
[26:10.070 --> 26:11.870]  This is about wolves or something, wasn't it?
[26:13.050 --> 26:13.930]  Oh, Wolfspa.
[26:14.230 --> 26:14.670]  Wolfspa.
[26:14.990 --> 26:15.430]  Wolfspa.
[26:15.730 --> 26:16.170]  Wolfspa.
[26:16.590 --> 26:19.310]  Or it was like the end race or maybe...
[26:19.310 --> 26:19.510]  Something.
[26:19.510 --> 26:21.390]  I think we reused a few things.
[26:21.490 --> 26:25.910]  We started doing races where it'd be like, just go from here to Wolfspa.
[26:27.790 --> 26:28.770]  Oh, what's this one?
[26:29.630 --> 26:30.570]  Is this Petting Zoo?
[26:31.150 --> 26:31.710]  No Petting Zoo?
[26:31.930 --> 26:32.830]  No Petting Zoo.
[26:33.450 --> 26:33.730]  Yeah.
[26:34.390 --> 26:38.350]  We had to build obsidian holes because the creepers were blowing up the dirt holes.
[26:39.050 --> 26:39.270]  Yeah.
[26:40.210 --> 26:41.050]  Those creepers.
[26:41.930 --> 26:42.770]  I remember Mario.
[26:42.830 --> 26:43.950]  Mario in the background.
[26:44.550 --> 26:45.350]  What's this, a bar?
[26:45.730 --> 26:46.190]  What is this?
[26:47.710 --> 26:48.070]  Oh.
[26:48.630 --> 26:49.590]  We had a bar?
[26:52.970 --> 26:54.930]  Oh, this has some like enchanting stuff.
[26:55.030 --> 26:56.150]  This might have been a later thing.
[26:56.710 --> 26:57.890]  This might be a Lindsay one.
[27:00.510 --> 27:00.910]  Huh.
[27:02.050 --> 27:03.530]  It feels familiar though.
[27:03.650 --> 27:04.850]  I don't think I made it.
[27:06.050 --> 27:06.990]  Dude, look at Mario.
[27:07.750 --> 27:10.730]  That took some time to make.
[27:11.010 --> 27:11.850]  Oh, here's a bunch of...
[27:12.690 --> 27:13.670]  I wonder what this is all about.
[27:13.810 --> 27:14.710]  A bunch of redstone.
[27:15.550 --> 27:19.070]  Do you remember coming up with all the little riddles for the...
[27:19.830 --> 27:20.290]  Yes.
[27:21.870 --> 27:23.710]  You came up with diabetes on your feet.
[27:23.890 --> 27:24.410]  For your feeties.
[27:24.630 --> 27:24.750]  Yeah.
[27:24.990 --> 27:26.530]  Oh shit, this rain actually moves.
[27:26.970 --> 27:27.670]  This is working.
[27:28.450 --> 27:29.770]  Oh, this is definitely not us.
[27:30.410 --> 27:30.730]  No.
[27:30.950 --> 27:31.890]  I couldn't come up with this.
[27:32.410 --> 27:33.930]  No, are you kidding?
[27:34.630 --> 27:34.890]  No.
[27:35.210 --> 27:36.650]  So is this pistons doing this?
[27:36.930 --> 27:38.250]  This is something that worked...
[27:38.250 --> 27:41.790]  that still works after being designed like five levels of Minecraft ago.
[27:41.950 --> 27:43.090]  This is like crazy.
[27:43.270 --> 27:43.930]  That's really cool.
[27:44.410 --> 27:48.010]  This must have been like a wet clouds.
[27:50.470 --> 27:51.670]  Yeah, I don't know.
[27:53.330 --> 27:55.910]  Like a storm, like the clouds are gray, like a storm cloud.
[27:56.670 --> 27:59.330]  What's this, uh, what's this target creeper mouth thing?
[28:01.030 --> 28:02.450]  Where are you seeing that?
[28:02.650 --> 28:11.690]  Oh, uh, that's like a glass dome.
[28:12.330 --> 28:13.350]  That's a Matt and Jeremy.
[28:13.750 --> 28:17.160]  And we, I, I participated in the...
[28:17.630 --> 28:21.310]  I didn't build this, but I, it was, I remember playing it.
[28:21.710 --> 28:22.170]  It was good.
[28:22.170 --> 28:24.770]  I don't remember what it was exactly, but it was some sort of a creeper soccer.
[28:25.310 --> 28:26.930]  Like you're trying to lead a creeper in.
[28:27.310 --> 28:28.090]  Maybe it was creeper soccer.
[28:28.730 --> 28:29.050]  What?
[28:29.710 --> 28:32.370]  Maybe it was like something like that, where you try to lead a creeper in and blow up.
[28:33.130 --> 28:35.350]  Get them to blow up in the, uh, in the goal.
[28:36.250 --> 28:36.630]  Does that sound right?
[28:36.670 --> 28:37.090]  That sounds right.
[28:37.650 --> 28:38.170]  That sounds right.
[28:38.370 --> 28:39.390]  Do you remember what this is?
[28:44.790 --> 28:46.590]  This might have been regular petting zoo.
[28:46.850 --> 28:47.690]  This is petting zoo.
[28:48.030 --> 28:48.330]  Yeah.
[28:49.430 --> 28:49.750]  Yeah.
[28:51.770 --> 28:53.990]  And what's this big black box?
[28:56.050 --> 28:57.370]  Were we trying to spawn?
[28:57.690 --> 28:59.050]  Oh God, it's dark over here.
[28:59.830 --> 29:00.780]  I remember this.
[29:01.750 --> 29:04.110]  This castle, we didn't use to have shadows, did we?
[29:04.970 --> 29:05.350]  No.
[29:05.730 --> 29:06.770]  Like, look at this, look where I am.
[29:06.810 --> 29:07.190]  Do you see this?
[29:07.350 --> 29:09.290]  Oh, are you talking about this?
[29:09.450 --> 29:12.490]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[29:12.550 --> 29:15.190]  Cause then I guess mobs can spawn in the daytime now.
[29:16.730 --> 29:18.150]  So this big black box.
[29:19.090 --> 29:21.630]  This was nether realm or nether?
[29:22.010 --> 29:22.630]  What was it?
[29:22.650 --> 29:23.550]  There was a point to it.
[29:23.570 --> 29:24.510]  You would go in.
[29:25.750 --> 29:27.190]  There was a door somewhere, right?
[29:27.450 --> 29:28.090]  There's a door here.
[29:28.590 --> 29:30.190]  And this, and this is the, uh, enchant.
[29:30.230 --> 29:31.830]  Was this the enchanting video?
[29:32.790 --> 29:33.490]  I don't remember.
[29:33.510 --> 29:37.010]  Oh God, didn't you used to have to put books around the book and it would enchant higher?
[29:37.770 --> 29:38.810]  Yeah, that's right.
[29:38.930 --> 29:39.450]  It was complicated.
[29:41.290 --> 29:43.210]  All right, I gotta go in this box and see what it was.
[29:44.370 --> 29:47.950]  Maybe it was to farm stuff for potions or enchantments.
[29:48.150 --> 29:49.270]  It must've been.
[29:50.410 --> 29:53.730]  God, I wish my memory was good.
[29:54.650 --> 29:58.150]  I used to have like a photographic memory of this place.
[29:58.290 --> 30:03.210]  And then as soon as other people started building for us, I just lost it.
[30:03.350 --> 30:04.070]  I just, it all went away.
[30:05.010 --> 30:05.110]  Yeah.
[30:05.870 --> 30:06.850]  Well, that's what happens.
[30:07.530 --> 30:09.210]  So what was this big disc up here?
[30:09.370 --> 30:10.810]  The one that's casting the shadow.
[30:12.130 --> 30:14.470]  Um, it's water on signs.
[30:14.770 --> 30:17.030]  Once again, one we didn't make.
[30:17.030 --> 30:23.130]  Is it like, uh, maybe you're in boats and you're trying to hit each other and break the boat.
[30:23.450 --> 30:25.850]  And then they fall to the death or something.
[30:26.950 --> 30:27.690]  Good idea.
[30:27.830 --> 30:32.130]  Bow and arrow sticks.
[30:32.850 --> 30:34.430]  You probably figured out from what's in the chest.
[30:34.610 --> 30:34.990]  Boats.
[30:35.150 --> 30:36.370]  Yeah, it's a boat based thing.
[30:37.030 --> 30:39.510]  So it's probably like bow and arrow in a boat.
[30:40.150 --> 30:45.830]  Maybe you like one person drives, the other person shoots, or maybe it's solo play.
[30:45.910 --> 30:46.290]  I don't know.
[30:46.290 --> 30:47.110]  I don't.
[30:48.210 --> 30:52.030]  I definitely, you can instantly tell shit we didn't make.
[30:54.130 --> 30:54.490]  Instantly.
[30:54.750 --> 30:56.370]  You're like, oh, it's symmetrical?
[30:56.730 --> 30:56.990]  Nah.
[30:57.470 --> 31:01.330]  Like I could, I know as soon as I saw a stone on the tower, I was like, I did, I definitely didn't
[31:01.330 --> 31:02.070]  build that flag.
[31:02.730 --> 31:03.090]  No.
[31:03.790 --> 31:08.370]  But you know, you know, if you built it, it fucking, it may have been ugly, but it worked
[31:08.370 --> 31:09.270]  like a charm.
[31:09.750 --> 31:13.050]  Yeah. I remember all of our stuff working pretty, I mean, what was this one down here?
[31:13.170 --> 31:14.730]  Oh, here's Felix Baumgartner.
[31:15.530 --> 31:16.970]  Oh, that was an early one, wasn't it?
[31:17.050 --> 31:19.130]  Because Felix Baumgartner had just done the jump.
[31:20.050 --> 31:22.070]  Oh, it's so ugly, but we wanted it to be ugly.
[31:22.330 --> 31:22.570]  Yeah.
[31:24.570 --> 31:25.930]  Oh, what was this?
[31:31.410 --> 31:33.830]  This looks ugly enough to be ours, but I don't.
[31:33.870 --> 31:35.290]  Oh, it definitely is ours.
[31:35.410 --> 31:36.550]  I remember making this.
[31:36.810 --> 31:37.430]  Was it a pit?
[31:38.710 --> 31:39.490]  I don't know.
[31:39.690 --> 31:41.670]  There was one we had with like dark reddish blocks.
[31:41.770 --> 31:42.650]  That was like a fight one.
[31:43.650 --> 31:46.390]  What's this over here with the little areas here?
[31:46.390 --> 31:47.550]  Is this like a farming one?
[31:48.690 --> 31:50.210]  Was this your mercantile one?
[31:51.190 --> 31:53.190]  Oh, did you find the farming and mercantile?
[31:53.430 --> 31:54.230]  I think so.
[31:54.850 --> 31:56.190]  Oh, here's Fish and Jamboree.
[31:59.190 --> 31:59.950]  Oh, yeah.
[32:01.510 --> 32:03.970]  Yes, this is the farming and mercantile episode.
[32:05.050 --> 32:06.830]  Fish and Jamboree is all frozen up now.
[32:07.790 --> 32:08.370]  Climate change.
[32:09.230 --> 32:10.930]  That green one I didn't do.
[32:11.390 --> 32:11.770]  That's...
[32:11.770 --> 32:12.690]  Yeah, I didn't do this one.
[32:12.830 --> 32:13.750]  That's, that's the...
[32:17.010 --> 32:17.990]  Let's have a look at this.
[32:18.530 --> 32:19.490]  Once again, it...
[32:20.790 --> 32:23.410]  Oh, this is definitely some sort of goal related game.
[32:24.190 --> 32:25.330]  There's two goals in there.
[32:25.950 --> 32:26.750]  Was it like an ice hockey?
[32:27.670 --> 32:28.790]  Maybe. Yeah, it must have been.
[32:29.090 --> 32:29.890]  That's so cool.
[32:30.970 --> 32:31.690]  And this...
[32:31.690 --> 32:34.350]  Oh, I think this is the one we thought was really ugly.
[32:35.910 --> 32:36.890]  Uh, yeah, I see why.
[32:37.210 --> 32:40.330]  We got bummed out after we built it, and then...
[32:40.330 --> 32:40.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:41.530 --> 32:42.110]  Yeah, you're right.
[32:42.290 --> 32:43.370]  This one I think was the...
[32:45.810 --> 32:46.530]  Ten Towers?
[32:50.040 --> 32:50.900]  Three, six...
[32:50.900 --> 32:51.520]  Yeah, Ten Towers.
[32:53.200 --> 32:55.240]  Or maybe it was less and we put more in later.
[32:57.300 --> 32:58.160]  That's a cool idea.
[32:58.300 --> 32:59.480]  I thought it was 12 Towers.
[33:00.000 --> 33:00.760]  I thought so too.
[33:01.040 --> 33:02.580]  There's Ice Cube, that's cool.
[33:03.380 --> 33:04.860]  There's some stuff we haven't found.
[33:05.740 --> 33:06.460]  Look at this.
[33:06.540 --> 33:07.300]  This is, uh...
[33:09.280 --> 33:11.840]  I don't remember what we called it, but it was one where we shot ghasts.
[33:12.000 --> 33:12.860]  It didn't work very well.
[33:15.260 --> 33:15.880]  Like the ghast...
[33:15.880 --> 33:17.360]  Was it like a shooting gallery of some sort?
[33:17.380 --> 33:18.720]  Shooting gallery, maybe, yeah.
[33:21.480 --> 33:23.740]  And then this house was what?
[33:25.360 --> 33:26.920]  I don't know that I built this.
[33:27.840 --> 33:29.120]  Oh, here's, uh...
[33:31.820 --> 33:35.540]  One of the appreciation videos, I believe.
[33:36.080 --> 33:37.300]  This is exactly what I was talking about.
[33:37.400 --> 33:39.420]  Like Minecraft, like, update appreciation.
[33:40.060 --> 33:43.480]  So clearly they added in stained glass and then we just had to make up...
[33:43.480 --> 33:45.560]  And three different doors, yeah.
[33:46.560 --> 33:47.940]  I liked the appreciations.
[33:48.580 --> 33:48.960]  I did too.
[33:51.340 --> 33:52.660]  So here's Ice Cube.
[33:54.800 --> 33:56.100]  That's a cool one, man.
[33:57.780 --> 34:00.960]  I think it was just basically a dig down that we could all see each other in, right?
[34:01.560 --> 34:02.520]  Where to find stuff in there?
[34:03.200 --> 34:04.300]  Yeah, something like that.
[34:05.240 --> 34:08.100]  You want to head on over toward the altar?
[34:08.960 --> 34:09.160]  Yeah.
[34:09.280 --> 34:10.640]  Oh, before we go over there, what's this...
[34:12.060 --> 34:15.700]  Over by the shooting gallery, what's this colored square one?
[34:16.220 --> 34:17.240]  What the fuck is...
[34:17.240 --> 34:17.980]  Where am I?
[34:18.540 --> 34:19.480]  Oh, I found Monopoly!
[34:20.100 --> 34:21.360]  Oh dude, where's Monopoly?
[34:22.180 --> 34:23.220]  And Creeper Soccer.
[34:23.580 --> 34:24.560]  Is that what that one was?
[34:24.960 --> 34:25.820]  Was that Creeper Soccer?
[34:26.940 --> 34:29.120]  This one was the fighting one, I think, next to...
[34:30.100 --> 34:30.460]  Yeah.
[34:31.120 --> 34:31.960]  Was this the pit?
[34:32.040 --> 34:33.000]  Would that have been a golden...
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.480]  Yeah, this is the pit, I think.
[34:34.620 --> 34:35.400]  And then Monopoly...
[34:38.900 --> 34:41.100]  We did a Monopoly in the Nether too, didn't we?
[34:41.600 --> 34:44.540]  Yeah, we did Dark Monopoly or Nether Monopoly, whatever we're calling it.
[34:44.680 --> 34:46.020]  And then above Monopoly is...
[34:48.780 --> 34:50.500]  Some sort of sheep game, maybe?
[34:51.040 --> 34:53.360]  Yeah, where you're betting on who's going to fall.
[34:56.650 --> 34:57.310]  Creeper Soccer.
[34:57.910 --> 34:58.710]  Creeper Soccer.
[34:58.930 --> 35:01.410]  Very popular episode, everybody loved it.
[35:02.430 --> 35:03.130]  Is that true?
[35:03.930 --> 35:06.870]  No, everybody hated it for some reason. I thought it was fine.
[35:07.330 --> 35:08.370]  I think it was just kind of jank.
[35:08.970 --> 35:14.030]  I think this is Creeper Soccer and that's like Creeper Soccer X or something.
[35:15.850 --> 35:17.770]  This is how Creeper Soccer should have been built.
[35:18.390 --> 35:18.830]  Yeah.
[35:19.610 --> 35:22.710]  It's so densely populated.
[35:23.510 --> 35:30.010]  God damn. We built Achievement Hunter Railway because our builds were getting pretty far out,
[35:30.130 --> 35:35.790]  but just being able to see how small the rail track was, it's so weird.
[35:36.330 --> 35:40.150]  We were basically in downtown Achievement City. We were right next to everything.
[35:42.990 --> 35:46.010]  Oh, here's the glory hole. Or what was it? No glory hole?
[35:46.410 --> 35:47.730]  Where's that? Where are you now?
[35:47.730 --> 35:52.530]  I went behind the giant tower of pimps.
[35:54.150 --> 35:56.750]  Put dick here. There's no sign of it.
[35:58.330 --> 36:00.210]  I wonder what happens if I do it. Does it work?
[36:10.060 --> 36:14.400]  So this one, I think we wanted the longest redstone delay possible.
[36:14.620 --> 36:15.840]  So we made it go the whole way.
[36:16.440 --> 36:19.800]  I don't know if it's broken at the other end or if it just takes this long to come back.
[36:21.540 --> 36:25.100]  Oh, it's so stupid.
[36:26.300 --> 36:27.440]  I bet it's working.
[36:28.320 --> 36:29.460]  I mean, it turned on.
[36:36.710 --> 36:38.830]  We just lived and breathed Minecraft.
[36:38.990 --> 36:42.830]  Even at lunch, we'd go get food and go to a bar or something,
[36:42.930 --> 36:44.630]  and then we'd come back with three Minecrafts.
[36:45.650 --> 36:52.390]  It was a very creatively fulfilling time, for sure.
[36:52.610 --> 36:55.090]  There's just so much to be done in it.
[36:55.630 --> 37:00.250]  It just felt like every week we came up with something sillier than the last.
[37:00.530 --> 37:04.270]  Well, I guess it's not going to make its way back, but that's okay.
[37:04.410 --> 37:06.610]  Yeah, maybe time has eroded the circuit.
[37:06.870 --> 37:08.270]  Let's see. What else should we look at?
[37:08.310 --> 37:08.940]  Do you want to go look at...
[37:10.110 --> 37:11.550]  Do you want to approach from the altar,
[37:11.770 --> 37:14.950]  or do you want to approach from, like, giant creeper and the pig and the sheep?
[37:16.750 --> 37:18.130]  Let's approach from the altar.
[37:18.910 --> 37:19.250]  Okay.
[37:19.830 --> 37:21.250]  Because we haven't been over there yet, really.
[37:21.690 --> 37:22.690]  Oh, I love this world.
[37:23.970 --> 37:28.310]  Yeah, it's given my heart a big smile, for sure, to be running around here.
[37:30.310 --> 37:32.990]  All right, I'm going to go down and find the front door to this bitch.
[37:33.070 --> 37:34.150]  I think it's over here.
[37:35.490 --> 37:37.250]  I like that we made this out of cobblestone.
[37:37.490 --> 37:39.050]  Like, we couldn't have made an uglier pyramid.
[37:41.730 --> 37:43.770]  You couldn't have made an ugly...
[37:43.770 --> 37:45.530]  Yeah, it's exactly where I remembered it being.
[37:48.610 --> 37:49.010]  Wow.
[37:49.430 --> 37:50.930]  It's weird to look at this and be like,
[37:50.930 --> 37:53.650]  oh, I haven't had a fight on here since my early 20s.
[37:59.940 --> 38:02.100]  Oh, this is so much fun to make.
[38:05.060 --> 38:06.440]  We were so lucky.
[38:07.100 --> 38:10.240]  I felt it at the time, but it's true, man.
[38:10.820 --> 38:13.860]  We just got to play in this all day long.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.260]  It was such a gift.
[38:16.560 --> 38:19.680]  And enough time has passed now where I look back on it fondly,
[38:19.680 --> 38:21.460]  because I don't remember all the time we wasted
[38:21.460 --> 38:23.460]  trying to deal with all the technical issues of
[38:23.900 --> 38:27.040]  trying to have six people in here all the time and having to...
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.780]  Honestly, Gav, let's take a trip back about 47 minutes to the first
[38:32.320 --> 38:34.720]  10 minutes of us trying to film this,
[38:34.840 --> 38:37.540]  which was just our skins didn't show up properly,
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.280]  even though we had them...
[38:39.280 --> 38:40.900]  Well, first of all, I had to figure out how to get Master Chief.
[38:40.940 --> 38:41.740]  That was the whole thing.
[38:42.180 --> 38:46.720]  And then we put the right skins on, and then the game just showed different skins.
[38:46.880 --> 38:47.840]  You were Michael for a while.
[38:47.960 --> 38:48.980]  You were Matt Bragg.
[38:49.620 --> 38:51.380]  I was Steve for a little...
[38:51.380 --> 38:53.080]  It's just like we couldn't get them to appear.
[38:53.340 --> 38:53.720]  And then...
[38:54.760 --> 38:55.900]  Yeah, I don't miss...
[38:56.580 --> 38:58.180]  10 minutes of fighting the game.
[38:58.500 --> 38:59.760]  Later, here we are.
[39:01.460 --> 39:01.820]  Wow.
[39:02.420 --> 39:04.500]  Do you want to go over to the animals?
[39:05.300 --> 39:05.640]  Yeah.
[39:05.920 --> 39:06.800]  And then we'll just walk to...
[39:07.620 --> 39:09.740]  Yeah, I'm gonna go around the side here.
[39:10.760 --> 39:12.500]  What did we end up calling the big animals?
[39:12.860 --> 39:13.900]  We had a name for the area.
[39:14.540 --> 39:14.900]  Petting...
[39:20.140 --> 39:21.760]  It wasn't Petting Zoo.
[39:23.040 --> 39:25.460]  Was it E-I-E-I-WOE? Or was that something else?
[39:25.800 --> 39:27.700]  E-I-E-I-WOE. That might be it.
[39:29.940 --> 39:33.100]  I wonder if the door to the sheeps anus still works.
[39:37.010 --> 39:40.950]  This is one of the very first things we built in Minecraft.
[39:41.770 --> 39:43.070]  Yeah. All right, I'm gonna hit the switch.
[39:43.670 --> 39:43.930]  All right.
[39:46.510 --> 39:48.210]  Hey! We're in a disaster.
[39:48.550 --> 39:48.670]  Oh, no.
[39:49.450 --> 39:52.630]  Look how we didn't know... I mean, I still don't really know redstone,
[39:52.750 --> 39:55.230]  but you could tell we didn't know how the hell to make this work.
[39:55.310 --> 39:58.130]  So you just walk into a bunch of circuitry.
[39:58.650 --> 40:00.490]  Is that a bunch of diamond boots in here?
[40:01.430 --> 40:02.590]  That must have been from something.
[40:03.670 --> 40:05.150]  Maybe there's a scavenger hunt or something.
[40:06.210 --> 40:06.570]  Dude.
[40:07.410 --> 40:08.570]  It's so funny.
[40:10.330 --> 40:14.650]  This would be like visiting Earth after humans died, long or gone,
[40:14.950 --> 40:16.630]  and flipping a switch and it working.
[40:17.130 --> 40:18.370]  Being like, holy shit, all right.
[40:19.070 --> 40:19.470]  Dude.
[40:19.730 --> 40:21.490]  It's kind of like Horizon Zero Dawn vibes.
[40:22.110 --> 40:23.510]  There was a civilization here before.
[40:24.470 --> 40:25.190]  It really is.
[40:25.250 --> 40:25.750]  They should do it.
[40:25.770 --> 40:26.990]  They should make it be like Animal Crossing,
[40:27.010 --> 40:29.670]  where you come back and everything's just overgrown like a motherfucker.
[40:30.090 --> 40:33.570]  This is like playing Halo, but we're the forerunners.
[40:38.830 --> 40:40.930]  And I think this creeper was real, right?
[40:41.010 --> 40:41.930]  It was full of dynamite.
[40:42.590 --> 40:43.610]  Yeah, I believe so.
[40:44.590 --> 40:45.510]  Yep, it is.
[40:48.210 --> 40:54.830]  So our decision to have a map of TNT under the logo in Achievement City
[40:54.830 --> 40:58.410]  was maybe one of the worst decisions we could ever have come up with.
[40:58.650 --> 40:59.930]  It really fucked the world up.
[41:00.270 --> 41:06.070]  It was like extra laggy over here, and if lightning struck it, sometimes it would go off.
[41:06.130 --> 41:08.250]  And if there was a fire that spread, it would go off.
[41:08.830 --> 41:10.610]  It really ruined our playground.
[41:10.930 --> 41:12.610]  This bridge used to give me fits.
[41:12.710 --> 41:15.330]  I never felt comfortable with how we made it.
[41:15.330 --> 41:16.430]  And tried to get it nice.
[41:17.750 --> 41:22.590]  I don't know why I ever cared, or why it mattered.
[41:23.170 --> 41:24.770]  Oh, the butts just dropped. Did you see that?
[41:25.550 --> 41:26.590]  I just saw the butts drop.
[41:27.230 --> 41:29.190]  Oh my god, butts dropped! On its own?
[41:29.430 --> 41:35.790]  Yeah, I think a lot of stuff is like, it's saved in state until we load it, and then it will...
[41:35.790 --> 41:38.710]  Oh shit, and the thing's on fire. The red thing's on fire.
[41:38.970 --> 41:39.470]  What is that?
[41:39.470 --> 41:40.190]  Why is that on fire?
[41:41.270 --> 41:42.150]  I don't even know.
[41:43.030 --> 41:44.110]  Yeah, the rain will put it out, maybe.
[41:45.990 --> 41:50.350]  I think fire probably doesn't burn in creative anyway, maybe? I don't know.
[41:50.650 --> 41:51.570]  I want to go to the top of your...
[41:53.890 --> 41:56.930]  So there's... at this point there would have been a museum too, right?
[41:57.030 --> 42:00.410]  Do you think the museum exists under Achievement City?
[42:01.330 --> 42:03.710]  Yeah, well we took out all the TNT at one point, didn't we?
[42:04.050 --> 42:06.310]  Yeah, and we built the museum with like... oh yeah, here we go!
[42:07.810 --> 42:10.010]  Let's see, before we go up to the top of my house.
[42:10.950 --> 42:12.270]  Yeah, this was a cool idea.
[42:16.030 --> 42:19.130]  Do you think the vault is still below your house?
[42:21.330 --> 42:25.890]  I think probably? We didn't... did we remove it? Let's go see.
[42:26.490 --> 42:29.310]  I just realized this is a different Master Chief skin than your usual one.
[42:29.710 --> 42:30.750]  Yeah, it's different.
[42:33.530 --> 42:35.150]  I don't know what happened to my usual one.
[42:39.770 --> 42:41.130]  The door slammed in my face.
[42:43.930 --> 42:47.790]  Oh, I loved your... do you remember this? Do you remember what you called this?
[42:49.350 --> 42:49.710]  No.
[42:49.890 --> 42:51.290]  This was just your, like, your upstairs.
[42:52.590 --> 42:53.310]  The upstairs?
[42:58.070 --> 42:59.390]  It's like your second story.
[43:00.110 --> 43:01.910]  So the vault... is it still there?
[43:02.410 --> 43:03.090]  Yeah, I'm in it.
[43:03.290 --> 43:05.690]  This was where we kept... for those who don't remember,
[43:05.750 --> 43:09.570]  this is where we kept a bunch of our duped items before Creative Mode.
[43:10.990 --> 43:11.350]  Yeah.
[43:11.490 --> 43:14.550]  We glitched a bunch of stuff and we used to keep it in these chests.
[43:15.290 --> 43:17.630]  Because it was really hard to build before Creative Mode.
[43:17.630 --> 43:18.690]  So this is basically what...
[43:19.970 --> 43:23.190]  this was our inventory before you could just Creative Mode an inventory.
[43:24.410 --> 43:24.810]  Yeah.
[43:26.110 --> 43:28.990]  Imagine a time in Minecraft when there was no Creative Mode
[43:28.990 --> 43:31.370]  and everything that you built had to be mined.
[43:31.870 --> 43:34.870]  And that's the first, I don't know, year of Achievement City, maybe?
[43:35.990 --> 43:36.850]  Maybe not quite a year.
[43:36.850 --> 43:40.790]  I don't know if it was a year, but we had to glitch a bunch of colored wool to make the logo.
[43:41.110 --> 43:46.230]  So this is Jeremy's renovation of Ray's house.
[43:47.630 --> 43:48.830]  Oh yeah, I'm gonna go see that.
[43:49.790 --> 43:51.890]  I love that butts dropped and now it's there forever.
[43:53.750 --> 43:55.210]  Oh yeah, here's Jeremy's house.
[43:55.610 --> 43:56.510]  That was a fun day.
[43:58.430 --> 43:59.670]  We presented it to him.
[44:00.130 --> 44:01.610]  And he was like, cool, I'm gonna go to Boston now.
[44:05.290 --> 44:06.010]  Not really.
[44:07.150 --> 44:09.050]  Oh yeah, there's a little thing you get on too.
[44:09.870 --> 44:10.290]  Oh wow.
[44:10.930 --> 44:12.950]  Yeah, Jeremy was such a...
[44:12.950 --> 44:15.870]  I was always excited to leave the world in Jeremy's hands and come back.
[44:16.590 --> 44:17.830]  He's such a clever builder.
[44:18.570 --> 44:23.090]  And I guess all the circuitry is gone, but there used to be the whole cake wall behind this.
[44:23.590 --> 44:25.670]  Oh dude, he's got a little room.
[44:28.190 --> 44:28.770]  Look at this.
[44:35.090 --> 44:35.730]  Oh god.
[44:37.050 --> 44:37.370]  Creepy.
[44:37.690 --> 44:39.750]  Do you think... my wife asked me this the other day.
[44:39.830 --> 44:41.930]  She said, do you think there'll be Easter eggs in the Minecraft movie?
[44:42.390 --> 44:43.950]  And I was like, I don't know, that's an interesting question.
[44:43.950 --> 44:47.030]  And she asked if I thought that there'd be like any kind of a reference to Achievement Hunter.
[44:47.190 --> 44:49.190]  And I thought, I can't imagine that there would be.
[44:49.310 --> 44:51.790]  But if there was, maybe it would be a tower.
[44:52.850 --> 44:54.550]  This at one point was in the tutorial.
[44:55.270 --> 44:55.590]  Yeah.
[44:56.310 --> 44:59.790]  Which is pretty cool for a kid's game that they put in something called the Tower of Pimps.
[45:00.410 --> 45:04.350]  And that we happened to be recording the second we found out was also very cool.
[45:04.890 --> 45:05.350]  Oh yeah.
[45:06.530 --> 45:07.650]  We're recording a different video.
[45:08.230 --> 45:11.470]  So we got our live reaction to finding out.
[45:12.050 --> 45:13.750]  You wanna go check out Gavi's house?
[45:14.090 --> 45:14.270]  Yeah.
[45:17.630 --> 45:19.470]  Oh, how does it feel to be back?
[45:21.610 --> 45:23.450]  God, I remember I had this all covered in...
[45:23.450 --> 45:27.210]  So this is something that was like a turning point for me in Achievement Hunter.
[45:28.150 --> 45:31.270]  Where we were working on something else, like maybe Cakewall or something.
[45:31.370 --> 45:32.770]  And I snuck over here to build this.
[45:35.350 --> 45:37.970]  Just because I thought it'd be like a really funny thing for people to find.
[45:38.690 --> 45:38.830]  Yeah.
[45:38.830 --> 45:43.310]  But then when it was found, everyone felt really bad for me.
[45:44.110 --> 45:46.150]  Everyone, like people at work were coming to me like,
[45:46.190 --> 45:48.230]  Oh, I'm sorry what they did to your like secret room.
[45:48.450 --> 45:52.270]  I was like, no, I made it because it's goofy and lame.
[45:52.310 --> 45:53.990]  And I thought it'd be funny for everyone to make fun of.
[45:56.010 --> 45:58.750]  So I thought after that, I have to become more of a prick in these videos.
[45:58.850 --> 46:00.690]  So people don't feel sorry for me as much.
[46:02.550 --> 46:06.350]  I was like, people were really devastated that they'd like, they'd shat on my little room.
[46:06.650 --> 46:06.970]  My little trophy room.
[46:06.970 --> 46:09.390]  That began the beginning of your villain arc?
[46:09.850 --> 46:12.770]  Uh, I just, yeah, I just think I jebbed it up slightly more after that.
[46:13.070 --> 46:14.650]  So people, so I wouldn't get sympathy.
[46:14.930 --> 46:17.410]  Not that it wasn't nice, but I was like, I wasn't really after that.
[46:18.030 --> 46:22.050]  Michael's house is Jack's house, probably full of lava still.
[46:22.490 --> 46:26.050]  This, this room right here was the entire reason we built the entire city.
[46:26.950 --> 46:31.250]  This room right here is the reason we built the entire city.
[46:31.370 --> 46:32.290]  That is true.
[46:32.290 --> 46:37.390]  Just so Jack could immediately destroy a bit that we worked on.
[46:37.710 --> 46:38.710]  He was too quick.
[46:39.130 --> 46:41.910]  He was not scared at all.
[46:42.470 --> 46:44.570]  And that's how we had to resort to plan G.
[46:46.550 --> 46:47.070]  Crazy.
[46:47.250 --> 46:49.210]  Which is now missing its button.
[46:49.770 --> 46:53.790]  Yeah. And there's only one piece of original dynamite left under there.
[46:53.870 --> 46:55.690]  And it's, it's behind a rope.
[46:56.230 --> 46:59.690]  I'm going to go to the top of your, so when we, when we did original plan G,
[47:01.670 --> 47:05.270]  it lagged the game so much that it kind of looked shit.
[47:05.790 --> 47:08.850]  So I remember when I was editing, I went back in to the world
[47:10.730 --> 47:16.090]  before it blew up and I re-blew it up and I stood on top of your house at its original height,
[47:16.950 --> 47:18.410]  just to get like a top down angle.
[47:18.690 --> 47:22.450]  And originally I had the top of the name because I, because we all had our names in the top corner.
[47:22.750 --> 47:25.450]  Originally I just put God, because it was like a view from above.
[47:25.950 --> 47:29.150]  And then I thought, oh, who's the, who's the God of Minecraft?
[47:29.150 --> 47:33.430]  So I put Notch. And then people thought that the actual Notch was in our game watching.
[47:34.170 --> 47:34.970]  He was not.
[47:35.250 --> 47:39.630]  Although he was aware of us and had said positive and kind things about us.
[47:39.830 --> 47:41.250]  Yep. At the time.
[47:41.350 --> 47:42.670]  What's all this dynamite up here for?
[47:43.430 --> 47:45.070]  It's your house rigged to blow?
[47:45.730 --> 47:48.670]  I think it's something Jeremy did. I don't remember exactly.
[47:49.990 --> 47:52.590]  It was some sort of a dynamite cannon, maybe?
[47:53.310 --> 47:54.830]  Shot off in the, I don't know.
[47:56.050 --> 47:57.050]  Who can remember?
[47:57.050 --> 47:59.370]  Do you think Jack's gonorrhea dick still works?
[48:01.890 --> 48:02.850]  Yeah. You want to find out?
[48:02.950 --> 48:03.110]  Yeah.
[48:05.310 --> 48:09.070]  Dude, look, even look from here, look above the logo and look how close the King,
[48:09.630 --> 48:10.850]  the King's court was.
[48:11.290 --> 48:12.890]  I know it's right fucking there.
[48:12.910 --> 48:13.970]  It's right there, dude.
[48:14.490 --> 48:15.870]  It felt like a journey to go to it.
[48:16.250 --> 48:19.210]  You know, it felt like you'd like, you'd leave Achievement City with provisions, you know.
[48:19.390 --> 48:21.330]  You'd be like, oh, I'm going to make the journey over to the King's court.
[48:21.550 --> 48:22.890]  It's like 30 blocks away.
[48:25.130 --> 48:26.550]  All right. How do you turn on Jack's dick?
[48:26.550 --> 48:28.010]  Oh, fuck, dude.
[48:28.090 --> 48:29.690]  Who can remember? Let's see.
[48:31.370 --> 48:32.030]  Well, there's...
[48:32.030 --> 48:33.090]  Would it be on his leg somewhere?
[48:39.540 --> 48:41.100]  Yeah, I think it'd be in his house.
[48:44.260 --> 48:45.600]  It might be on his head.
[48:45.760 --> 48:47.960]  Oh, who gave him tits?
[48:49.220 --> 48:50.060]  Jeremy, maybe?
[48:51.020 --> 48:52.140]  His tits have buttons.
[48:52.260 --> 48:52.780]  Shall I press one?
[48:53.260 --> 48:53.540]  Yeah.
[48:54.720 --> 48:55.860]  Maybe it's back here.
[48:55.940 --> 48:59.300]  When Jeremy added the hat, I remember that being a really funny realization.
[48:59.660 --> 49:00.460]  Very, very funny.
[49:01.240 --> 49:02.600]  Very, very funny.
[49:02.740 --> 49:03.800]  This was an early thing.
[49:03.900 --> 49:04.840]  The thing next to the pig.
[49:05.860 --> 49:06.920]  Is that a panda bear?
[49:08.360 --> 49:10.040]  Probably. I think there was bamboo added.
[49:10.740 --> 49:12.720]  Yeah, there's pandas here, right? It's under Jack.
[49:12.840 --> 49:13.160]  Oh, yeah.
[49:13.840 --> 49:14.900]  I'm sorry, what was the thing?
[49:14.980 --> 49:16.240]  Nature has just taken this place.
[49:16.460 --> 49:17.060]  What was this thing?
[49:17.220 --> 49:18.120]  This was the things to do.
[49:19.660 --> 49:20.520]  Do you remember what this was?
[49:20.980 --> 49:22.360]  Something to do with a ceiling falling in?
[49:23.140 --> 49:23.780]  Oh, Kerplunk.
[49:26.620 --> 49:28.060]  Yeah, yeah, Kerplunk.
[49:28.540 --> 49:30.540]  Dude, do you remember under Jack's house?
[49:30.620 --> 49:32.060]  There was a bunch of Let's Plays under there.
[49:33.560 --> 49:35.320]  Oh, we went to all the way to the bottom, right?
[49:36.020 --> 49:37.940]  Yeah, I'm gonna head that way right now.
[49:39.280 --> 49:41.620]  This is turning into a really long video, but I'm enjoying it.
[49:43.200 --> 49:45.940]  Uh, didn't we used to be able to go this?
[49:46.240 --> 49:46.720]  Oh, this way.
[49:49.710 --> 49:50.710]  Ah, thank you.
[49:54.570 --> 49:56.750]  Dear, the water is a different color. It's distracting.
[49:58.490 --> 49:59.230]  Is this the way?
[50:00.850 --> 50:01.790]  I don't even know what...
[50:02.970 --> 50:04.950]  I mean, we're not saving this. We can just mine down, right?
[50:05.590 --> 50:07.410]  I mean, I don't give a shit either way.
[50:09.770 --> 50:10.250]  Oh.
[50:12.530 --> 50:13.270]  There we go.
[50:13.470 --> 50:14.530]  Oh, yeah.
[50:14.930 --> 50:16.410]  So this isn't bedrock anymore?
[50:17.330 --> 50:19.830]  No, so you can go way lower than this now.
[50:20.170 --> 50:21.750]  This is where we would farm...
[50:24.630 --> 50:26.430]  This was a scary place.
[50:29.390 --> 50:31.090]  How was the fucking exit?
[50:31.790 --> 50:34.050]  Didn't we have like a punch glove down here?
[50:34.150 --> 50:36.470]  There was like a things to do where you just got punched in the face.
[50:37.170 --> 50:40.150]  That's where, yeah, that is where this started.
[50:40.490 --> 50:42.690]  And then it just expanded into...
[50:44.510 --> 50:46.550]  this arena where we would go and fight shit.
[50:46.650 --> 50:49.230]  But there was a way out, and I don't see that anymore.
[50:49.950 --> 50:52.690]  I recognize this being... I thought it was shittier down here.
[50:52.810 --> 50:54.310]  I didn't realize it was so well carved out.
[50:54.650 --> 50:57.310]  Maybe they... finished the basement?
[50:58.070 --> 50:58.850]  Maybe they did.
[50:58.850 --> 51:01.510]  It's weird. A lot of the time for our things to do, because it was weekly,
[51:01.990 --> 51:05.270]  we usually had like an idea session we'd have like three or four to do.
[51:05.570 --> 51:07.550]  But then occasionally we would be completely out,
[51:07.690 --> 51:09.010]  and we would still need to deliver one.
[51:09.370 --> 51:11.030]  So we'd come up with something really last minute,
[51:11.170 --> 51:13.810]  like surprise, which was just a punch glove coming out of the wall.
[51:14.170 --> 51:17.070]  But I think those last minute ones were often some of our best ones.
[51:19.230 --> 51:21.030]  Necessity is the mother of invention, as they say.
[51:21.270 --> 51:24.610]  Like the one I made in Skyrim, pissing off the preacher,
[51:24.730 --> 51:26.190]  was just because we had nothing.
[51:27.390 --> 51:28.530]  Dude, that was one of the all-time...
[51:28.530 --> 51:29.510]  I just...
[51:29.510 --> 51:33.930]  Do you want to quickly go to the nether and see if that's all the same?
[51:34.770 --> 51:35.090]  Yes.
[51:35.730 --> 51:36.710]  Where's the... where's the portal?
[51:37.090 --> 51:37.690]  Where's the main one?
[51:41.740 --> 51:42.220]  I...
[51:44.600 --> 51:45.080]  don't...
[51:45.080 --> 51:45.920]  Oh, there's one over here.
[51:46.440 --> 51:46.660]  Yeah.
[51:57.650 --> 51:59.810]  All right, building terrain, generating world.
[52:02.870 --> 52:04.910]  Dude, Dark Achievement City.
[52:05.770 --> 52:06.170]  Oh!
[52:08.130 --> 52:09.470]  Look at it!
[52:11.070 --> 52:13.870]  This place has such amazing lore.
[52:14.070 --> 52:15.470]  Like, look at all this stuff that's still here.
[52:16.350 --> 52:18.130]  This is Monopoly.
[52:19.050 --> 52:20.150]  Dark Monopoly right here.
[52:20.650 --> 52:20.930]  Oh, yeah.
[52:22.170 --> 52:24.050]  This was the one where you blew up a...
[52:25.110 --> 52:28.950]  You blew up a bed by accident, and I laughed for about a minute, I think.
[52:29.610 --> 52:30.690]  Because I had to sleep in it?
[52:31.030 --> 52:31.290]  Yeah.
[52:32.610 --> 52:35.130]  Oh, it's like little condensed versions of all of our builds.
[52:36.030 --> 52:37.290]  Yeah, it's so cool.
[52:38.130 --> 52:39.750]  God, those guys were so good at this.
[52:41.930 --> 52:42.870]  Even I could never.
[52:46.270 --> 52:48.970]  Oh, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen, man.
[52:50.470 --> 52:53.930]  I like that in Dark Achievement City, your house just goes through the ceiling.
[52:57.210 --> 52:58.910]  It was weird. Every time there was an update,
[52:58.910 --> 53:01.750]  we sometimes had to venture out of Achievement City to a new world,
[53:01.870 --> 53:04.330]  because our world was old and didn't have the new stuff.
[53:04.870 --> 53:06.970]  Yeah, like it was locked out of it.
[53:07.190 --> 53:10.270]  But then as our world expanded, we got some of the new stuff.
[53:11.210 --> 53:17.410]  Like, I remember Strongholds were a huge addition, but our world was pre-generated,
[53:17.530 --> 53:18.210]  so it didn't have any.
[53:19.190 --> 53:20.790]  All right, I'm popping back out.
[53:21.890 --> 53:25.630]  We should probably wrap this video up, I guess.
[53:25.710 --> 53:28.090]  I feel like we've... unless there's anything else you think we missed?
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.540]  Um... I think we saw quite a lot of stuff.
[53:35.100 --> 53:38.720]  And I feel like there's definitely stuff outside of the city limits,
[53:38.940 --> 53:42.640]  outside of greater Achievement City that we haven't looked at,
[53:42.680 --> 53:43.900]  but maybe we could do that another time.
[53:44.540 --> 53:49.040]  I think it would be fun to do a survival exploration
[53:49.040 --> 53:52.660]  outside the borders of Achievement City to see what we see, you know?
[53:53.220 --> 53:54.060]  Oh, there's Fart!
[53:55.900 --> 53:56.460]  Where's Fart?
[53:56.460 --> 54:00.480]  I'm so glad we went airborne.
[54:01.240 --> 54:03.500]  Oh, that was a piston thing, right?
[54:03.780 --> 54:04.360]  Does that still work?
[54:04.380 --> 54:06.140]  Yeah, this is the first one we did, I think.
[54:07.480 --> 54:08.240]  Yeah, see if you can remove...
[54:10.940 --> 54:11.660]  So cool!
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.860]  It all still works!
[54:14.020 --> 54:14.300]  It's great!
[54:15.060 --> 54:16.540]  It's because we built it right, Gavin.
[54:16.800 --> 54:19.620]  We built it right, and then the devs didn't do that thing where
[54:20.360 --> 54:22.580]  like a decade-old version of the game is completely useless.
[54:23.320 --> 54:24.560]  All right, anyway, follow me over here.
[54:25.120 --> 54:28.000]  Anyway, we should probably wrap this up, and I'll say thank you to everybody
[54:28.800 --> 54:32.120]  for going down this little trip down memory lane with Gavin and I.
[54:32.520 --> 54:35.460]  It was just kind of an idea that we had just shooting the shit the other day
[54:35.460 --> 54:39.300]  when we realized we could do it, and I don't know about you, but I had a blast.
[54:39.380 --> 54:42.720]  It's amazing how much I remembered, how much I don't remember.
[54:43.140 --> 54:47.080]  The whole thing, I find all of Achievement City to be way smaller than I remembered it,
[54:47.160 --> 54:49.500]  but way more charming than I remembered it as well.
[54:49.740 --> 54:50.080]  Yeah.
[54:50.560 --> 54:51.060]  What do you think?
[54:51.200 --> 54:51.840]  I love it.
[54:52.180 --> 54:52.800]  I love it, too.
[54:53.920 --> 54:54.800]  And, uh...
[54:54.800 --> 54:56.900]  It's literally weeks of work in that.
[54:58.000 --> 54:58.640]  Oh, yeah.
[54:59.000 --> 55:02.600]  I mean, years, but like total time definitely in the weeks and months.
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.040]  For sure, dude.
[55:04.480 --> 55:10.600]  I bet Habitat Humanity built houses faster than we built some of the shit in Achievement City.
[55:11.220 --> 55:13.520]  I was just looking down into Laval just to remember.
[55:14.920 --> 55:15.960]  That was a good one, too.
[55:17.600 --> 55:18.500]  Okay, where'd you go?
[55:18.500 --> 55:20.100]  I'm, uh, just right here.
[55:20.400 --> 55:21.560]  Uh, kind of...
[55:25.260 --> 55:29.180]  Let's see, I'm just outside the gates or just outside the border behind...
[55:31.900 --> 55:32.340]  Hop...
[55:33.080 --> 55:34.700]  Pop Hop or whatever it was called.
[55:35.420 --> 55:35.860]  What?
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.700]  Hot Hop Hot, whatever the fucking platformer thing by the door.
[55:41.680 --> 55:42.380]  Hot Foot.
[55:42.780 --> 55:43.340]  Hop Hot.
[55:43.440 --> 55:44.160]  I don't know what it was called.
[55:46.100 --> 55:46.880]  All right, hold on.
[55:46.920 --> 55:49.820]  I want to go to the, uh...
[55:49.820 --> 55:52.800]  What build caused us the biggest argument?
[55:54.360 --> 55:55.320]  Oh, God.
[55:55.740 --> 55:57.140]  Caused us the biggest argument?
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.000]  The biggest disagreements while building it.
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.600]  I don't know.
[56:00.700 --> 56:01.320]  What was it?
[56:02.020 --> 56:02.960]  I'm just gonna find it.
[56:03.460 --> 56:05.180]  Don't remember disagreeing with you much.
[56:05.560 --> 56:08.740]  It was, it was, we would, we just couldn't agree on the the way it should look.
[56:09.520 --> 56:10.220]  I'll just connect four.
[56:13.260 --> 56:16.120]  Oh, oh, oh, I know exactly what it is.
[56:19.920 --> 56:20.880]  It's over here, right?
[56:20.980 --> 56:22.680]  Yeah, it's over here. It's in this corner.
[56:23.020 --> 56:24.780]  Which definitely caused us the most arguments.
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.160]  You're 100% right.
[56:26.280 --> 56:28.140]  It's gotta be like, yeah, there it is.
[56:29.280 --> 56:36.800]  Oh, Christ.
[56:39.720 --> 56:40.620]  It's so tiny.
[56:40.920 --> 56:41.520]  The city end.
[56:42.200 --> 56:43.340]  The city end.
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.200]  We originally wanted to put the card of directions on each corner,
[56:47.280 --> 56:49.760]  just so we could get our bearings when we were walking out of the map.
[56:50.280 --> 56:50.580]  Yeah.
[56:50.720 --> 56:52.480]  So we're gonna have like north on one side, west on the other.
[56:52.480 --> 56:56.480]  And we built one end and decided let's never do the rest of them.
[56:57.940 --> 56:59.700]  You're right. We did fight about that.
[56:59.860 --> 57:01.340]  And we learned that we sucked.
[57:01.960 --> 57:06.800]  And the bigger we made it, the worse it looked.
[57:07.060 --> 57:07.200]  Yeah.
[57:08.340 --> 57:11.060]  This probably got the most revisions of anything we built.
[57:11.760 --> 57:13.180]  Oh, God, it's hideous.
[57:14.520 --> 57:15.180]  All right.
[57:15.500 --> 57:18.880]  That might be the reason that Bragg and Jeremy got hired.
[57:19.340 --> 57:19.580]  Maybe.
[57:20.160 --> 57:20.520]  That end.
[57:20.840 --> 57:21.240]  That one end.
[57:22.720 --> 57:23.700]  Yeah, you want to...
[57:24.500 --> 57:26.200]  Let's wrap this thing up, I guess.
[57:26.360 --> 57:26.460]  Yeah.
[57:28.480 --> 57:29.480]  Hey, I wanted to...
[57:30.260 --> 57:33.020]  While we're here, I wanted to show you one last thing.
[57:33.640 --> 57:33.900]  Okay.
[57:34.740 --> 57:35.600]  Are you with me?
[57:35.920 --> 57:36.600]  I'm behind you.
[57:37.040 --> 57:37.980]  Okay, just follow me.
[57:38.040 --> 57:39.980]  We're gonna go right through downtown Achievement City again.
[57:43.140 --> 57:48.220]  And goddamn, dude, look at all of this stupidity.
[57:49.780 --> 57:50.800]  It's so crazy.
[57:52.200 --> 57:54.480]  Anyway, right here, just outside of Achievement City, right?
[57:54.560 --> 57:55.400]  You can see butts right here.
[57:55.480 --> 57:56.800]  You can see Jack's stupid propeller hat.
[57:56.900 --> 57:58.440]  You can see that flag we never could have made.
[58:00.320 --> 58:00.960]  Right here.
[58:01.120 --> 58:01.740]  What do you think about this?
[58:06.340 --> 58:07.120]  Yeah, this works.
[58:08.360 --> 58:08.820]  All right.
[58:10.300 --> 58:11.580]  Well, thanks for watching, everybody.
[58:11.680 --> 58:12.460]  We'll see you next time.
[58:13.300 --> 58:13.620]  Bye.
