[00:00.000 --> 00:02.620]  Hello and welcome to Ratatouille part five.
[00:02.720 --> 00:04.340]  We got a special guest, Eric.
[00:04.520 --> 00:06.500]  Oh, on this fifth episode. OK.
[00:07.940 --> 00:09.280]  Geoff, how's it going?
[00:09.360 --> 00:10.820]  Am I special? Oh, man.
[00:11.060 --> 00:11.640]  You're special.
[00:11.760 --> 00:14.140]  I thought it was going to be Patton Oswald or Brad Garrett
[00:14.140 --> 00:15.500]  or someone that was in Ratatouille.
[00:16.720 --> 00:20.180]  Who is the cheapest person on Cameo that was in Ratatouille?
[00:20.660 --> 00:22.480]  I'll leave. I can leave.
[00:22.880 --> 00:24.740]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:24.740 --> 00:25.620]  We want you here.
[00:25.620 --> 00:28.520]  You're just as good as Patton Oswald or Brad Garrett or whatever.
[00:29.800 --> 00:33.420]  Yeah, yeah, that's how I often say that to myself in the mirror.
[00:34.340 --> 00:36.480]  You know, when I'm getting ready in the morning,
[00:36.540 --> 00:39.920]  I'm trying to psych myself up to go back to the harsh world.
[00:40.000 --> 00:40.580]  I go, you know what?
[00:40.600 --> 00:43.320]  You're just as good as Patton Oswald and Brad Garrett.
[00:43.440 --> 00:45.080]  You're you're at their level.
[00:45.660 --> 00:47.160]  Oh, Brian Dennehy died. Fuck.
[00:47.660 --> 00:49.280]  We could have. He died. Yeah.
[00:49.420 --> 00:53.800]  In 2020, I was about to say, it wasn't that a long, long time ago.
[00:53.940 --> 00:55.780]  Yeah. Peter O'Toole died in 2013.
[00:55.900 --> 00:56.680]  We could have gotten him.
[00:56.680 --> 00:58.720]  Trying to think, oh, man. Yeah.
[01:00.160 --> 01:02.280]  Do you imagine Peter O'Toole and cameo?
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.000]  Could you imagine Peter O'Toole doing something for regulation podcast
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.020]  related to this fucking video game?
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.080]  When I was a kid, there was this movie called My Favorite Year
[01:11.080 --> 01:14.080]  that had Peter O'Toole in it, and it was the only way I knew Peter O'Toole.
[01:14.460 --> 01:17.120]  And I was so surprised to find out he was famous outside of that movie
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.960]  at some point in my childhood when I got a little older.
[01:21.260 --> 01:25.060]  Do you remember when he got nominated at the end of his life for an Oscar
[01:25.660 --> 01:27.060]  and he had never won before?
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.040]  Yeah, it was like the fourth time.
[01:29.320 --> 01:31.540]  And it was like, for sure, he's going to get it.
[01:31.580 --> 01:32.440]  And he's about to die.
[01:32.620 --> 01:33.700]  And he lost.
[01:33.940 --> 01:36.880]  And the genuine disappointment is so funny.
[01:37.100 --> 01:39.620]  That is just burnt into my head. He was so mad.
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.900]  Yeah, dude, I just looked up the cast and who we could get.
[01:43.660 --> 01:44.980]  Uh-huh. We could we could get.
[01:45.620 --> 01:47.040]  We could get James Raymar.
[01:47.540 --> 01:49.280]  And he was Ajax and the Warriors.
[01:49.920 --> 01:51.280]  So. Oh, there you go.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.860]  Oh, he was dead. What?
[01:54.540 --> 01:55.860]  I think he's dead.
[01:55.960 --> 01:57.360]  No, that might be why we can get it.
[01:57.440 --> 01:58.720]  What are you talking about?
[01:58.780 --> 02:00.600]  No, I thought he was dead.
[02:00.760 --> 02:03.420]  No. You're thinking of Julie Newmar.
[02:03.700 --> 02:05.500]  Yeah, Julie. Yeah, I don't know.
[02:05.600 --> 02:07.020]  And she's gone to Wong Fu.
[02:11.320 --> 02:13.220]  OK, hey, Geoff, welcome, Geoff.
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.520]  No, shut up, Andrew.
[02:14.800 --> 02:16.660]  It's stop. He's alive. Catch me up.
[02:16.900 --> 02:20.400]  Catch me up. Welcome to Ratatouille 2007, the video game
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.500]  where everyone from we think the movie also did voices for this video game,
[02:25.780 --> 02:29.040]  which is very pleasing, including Brad Garrett and Julie Newmar.
[02:29.480 --> 02:31.080]  Julie Newmar and Brad Garrett.
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.360]  Yeah, Brad Garrett does have his voice in this.
[02:33.520 --> 02:36.700]  So Patton Oswald, it's been very strange.
[02:36.900 --> 02:39.300]  So this game is huge.
[02:39.620 --> 02:40.440]  It is expansive.
[02:40.740 --> 02:43.420]  It's much, much, much larger than we anticipated.
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.220]  And Andrew, from the outset, has said, we're going to 100% this.
[02:47.280 --> 02:49.620]  And then that has turned into doing an achievement guide.
[02:49.620 --> 02:54.160]  So we've just backdoored you into an achievement guide for Ratatouille 2007
[02:54.740 --> 02:58.180]  to help the people out there who want to do achievement.
[02:58.780 --> 03:00.260]  But it's 2024.
[03:00.880 --> 03:03.680]  Yes, it is. And this game is Ratatouille 2007.
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.140]  So, yeah, well, they didn't do a more recent one or else play that.
[03:08.240 --> 03:12.540]  Yeah, we're looking for Ratatouille 2024, but we couldn't find it.
[03:12.860 --> 03:16.380]  They stopped. I think it might be like a college football thing with the rights.
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.940]  I don't know. Yeah, I was thinking.
[03:18.440 --> 03:20.240]  I was thinking about achievements the other day.
[03:20.420 --> 03:21.720]  You know, I'm back into games now.
[03:21.920 --> 03:23.140]  We do a lot of gaming content.
[03:23.220 --> 03:26.700]  I've been playing, you know, I play a shitload of games on my own now as well.
[03:26.840 --> 03:29.000]  Which, by the way, X Defiant, that's the new hotness.
[03:29.240 --> 03:29.880]  Oh, wow. Really?
[03:30.380 --> 03:31.880]  That you played it, that Ubisoft game.
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.720]  And it's like it's Overwatch, essentially, but it's Overwatch.
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.220]  But with all Tom Clancy properties like the Division
[03:41.740 --> 03:45.940]  and Watch Dogs and Ghost Recon, yada yada yada.
[03:45.940 --> 03:49.120]  No, no Rainbow Six, unfortunately, but everything weird.
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.520]  Watch your little mouse feet. You don't get burned.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.320]  I'm watching.
[03:52.500 --> 03:56.260]  So this is the thing what you're seeing right now is I know.
[03:56.380 --> 03:57.780]  I want to get back to you thinking about achievements,
[03:57.780 --> 04:01.300]  but I just want you to see that Andrew has a task, didn't read
[04:01.300 --> 04:03.360]  what the task was, started doing the task.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.060]  I don't know. I got to put the thing in. Yeah, it started.
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.400]  I mean, here's what I'm going to say to that.
[04:08.680 --> 04:11.660]  Andrew and I have similar theories on how to put the thing in.
[04:13.240 --> 04:16.020]  It's it's and then and then it's him going back going,
[04:16.140 --> 04:19.260]  what am I supposed to do? No, look, I did the thing.
[04:19.340 --> 04:21.760]  You did a great job. OK, so you read it.
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.640]  You were thinking about, oh, I was just I've been reading lately
[04:24.640 --> 04:27.980]  that there's a potential that, you know, Microsoft
[04:27.980 --> 04:29.560]  might get out of the console market.
[04:29.660 --> 04:34.520]  Yes. And that Xbox may become a software service.
[04:35.200 --> 04:37.380]  Yeah. Like a Sega style subscriptions.
[04:37.680 --> 04:38.380]  Yeah. Sega style.
[04:38.380 --> 04:43.160]  And I got me thinking, like, you get so used to the idea when you
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.580]  when you adopt the technology or a flavor of a technology
[04:47.580 --> 04:50.700]  like in this case, Microsoft over PC or Nintendo,
[04:51.360 --> 04:53.140]  that it's going to be with you forever.
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.700]  And especially when you've had it for 20 years or so now.
[04:57.100 --> 05:00.460]  And it just struck me that Microsoft could make a decision in the next three
[05:00.460 --> 05:00.920]  or four years.
[05:00.920 --> 05:02.300]  And maybe I'm only thinking about this stuff now
[05:02.300 --> 05:04.780]  because it struck Warner Brothers that they didn't need to pay us anymore.
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.380]  So they stopped.
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.240]  Uh, they were like, oh, wait a minute.
[05:08.300 --> 05:10.480]  We don't have to keep this fucking.
[05:10.740 --> 05:13.620]  We don't have to keep bailing this fucking sinking ship out.
[05:13.720 --> 05:14.640]  We can just let it sink.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.620]  What the fuck is roots or teeth?
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.900]  I'm not paying for that anymore.
[05:19.140 --> 05:20.980]  Get this off my PNL stat.
[05:21.120 --> 05:22.760]  Yeah, 100 percent. Absolutely.
[05:23.400 --> 05:25.080]  So go, go, go, go, go, Andrew, go.
[05:25.920 --> 05:27.280]  Well, let's hold off. I'm going to kill him.
[05:27.320 --> 05:28.420]  I'm going to kill him.
[05:28.580 --> 05:33.320]  It just it just realized or I realized that I had taken for granted
[05:33.320 --> 05:35.300]  that I will always be able to hunt for achievements
[05:35.300 --> 05:37.320]  and that I will be a member of this architecture.
[05:37.500 --> 05:38.560]  But it could go away tomorrow.
[05:39.080 --> 05:41.200]  And Microsoft could just decide that it's not worth it anymore.
[05:41.600 --> 05:42.480]  Yeah, just like what?
[05:42.620 --> 05:45.980]  I just wonder like how that would affect my
[05:47.260 --> 05:48.300]  enjoyment of video games.
[05:48.340 --> 05:50.360]  Would it be a positive ultimately or negative?
[05:50.480 --> 05:53.000]  I don't know if if Microsoft specifically.
[05:53.160 --> 05:56.140]  Are you saying like any Microsoft specifically just turned off achievements
[05:56.140 --> 05:57.440]  and said it's like not a thing anymore.
[05:57.560 --> 05:58.620]  You don't go for them in games.
[05:58.760 --> 06:01.580]  I never got into it on the with trophies on the PlayStation.
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.460]  Oh, fuck.
[06:02.840 --> 06:06.920]  Would I just go back to enjoying video games for video game's sake
[06:06.920 --> 06:10.320]  or would I lose some deeper connection because achievements
[06:10.880 --> 06:14.360]  got me to play video games in a different way to achieve a task
[06:14.360 --> 06:16.280]  I wouldn't normally have thought?
[06:16.320 --> 06:16.960]  You know what I mean?
[06:17.440 --> 06:18.300]  Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
[06:18.760 --> 06:23.140]  I have never, ever, ever, ever, ever been like an achievements
[06:23.140 --> 06:25.740]  or trophies guy at all, like ever.
[06:25.960 --> 06:29.800]  It is just not there's nothing about it that I care about.
[06:29.920 --> 06:31.500]  I just don't. It's just not for me.
[06:31.500 --> 06:35.280]  So like turn them off and my day goes on just exactly the same.
[06:35.440 --> 06:36.440]  But I understand what you're talking.
[06:36.520 --> 06:38.000]  You started a company called Achievement Hunter.
[06:38.160 --> 06:39.760]  So I understand what you're saying.
[06:41.380 --> 06:44.900]  I really like them for my history, like tracking.
[06:45.080 --> 06:47.940]  It's good for tracking what you've played and how far you've played it.
[06:48.140 --> 06:51.780]  I just yeah, I mean, it is a record of your accomplishments
[06:51.780 --> 06:53.800]  in video games for those who care.
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.740]  But I just you know, I was always I always fell in love with them
[06:57.740 --> 07:00.160]  because they made me or I fell in love with them
[07:00.160 --> 07:03.700]  when they made me see video games differently.
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.300]  I loved I mean, Red vs. Blue exists because we played the video game wrong.
[07:08.680 --> 07:12.200]  Like clearly we're the kind of guys that just wanted to get in and tinker around
[07:12.200 --> 07:12.960]  and fuck with stuff.
[07:13.260 --> 07:15.160]  And and like the game tells you to go right.
[07:15.220 --> 07:18.100]  So you go left because fuck the game for telling you what to do kind of thing.
[07:19.120 --> 07:22.000]  But you know, there's there's achievement like I always talk about this one
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.960]  achievement I've talked about to death, but there was an achievement in modern
[07:23.960 --> 07:27.580]  and metal of Call of Duty three where you had to get from one end
[07:27.580 --> 07:30.100]  to like complete an entire level without using a gun.
[07:30.260 --> 07:32.840]  And like the whole point of that fucking game is to shoot people in the head.
[07:33.240 --> 07:36.680]  Right. You know, and it made me enjoy the game in an entirely different way
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.180]  that I never would have on my own.
[07:38.680 --> 07:41.080]  You know, I told I totally get it.
[07:41.300 --> 07:43.100]  I just I don't.
[07:43.620 --> 07:46.260]  Oh, this is this is mostly, by the way, what Ratatouille is,
[07:46.320 --> 07:48.580]  which is just a series of mini games that occur.
[07:49.040 --> 07:52.120]  Yeah. And Andrew focuses in.
[07:52.260 --> 07:53.640]  I'm being the best chef around.
[07:53.780 --> 07:55.700]  Yeah. He seems like he's been an active gamer.
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.000]  It's great.
[07:58.200 --> 08:00.400]  It's great. He's great at the rap.
[08:00.520 --> 08:03.940]  Well, it's dumb about this game, Geoff, is you would think it's once we fill the bar,
[08:04.040 --> 08:06.800]  we're done, but no, we have to wait the entire time limit.
[08:07.460 --> 08:08.840]  There's no way to do it faster.
[08:09.300 --> 08:12.360]  Yeah, I have to have the bar up as high as you can.
[08:12.700 --> 08:16.940]  Once you once you filled the bar completely, can you be lazy
[08:16.940 --> 08:18.280]  or will the bar deplete?
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.160]  I think it depletes. Yeah.
[08:20.240 --> 08:24.640]  So it's more of it's more of a like a maybe at a rate that it doesn't matter.
[08:24.640 --> 08:27.340]  I haven't touched anything for like 10 seconds.
[08:28.780 --> 08:31.300]  You got to just be above the star, baby. You got it.
[08:32.100 --> 08:33.960]  Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, you're fine.
[08:34.180 --> 08:38.000]  Did you see I guess this will date this, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
[08:38.620 --> 08:41.420]  Nuts. Did you see the SB Nation
[08:43.200 --> 08:46.120]  article or post that was an ode to Carl Anthony Towns,
[08:46.160 --> 08:47.400]  the most annoying guy in the NBA?
[08:48.320 --> 08:49.420]  I saw the headline.
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.340]  It is a it's just an article about
[08:53.200 --> 08:54.880]  Cat and how he's.
[08:56.220 --> 09:00.480]  I don't like this, like the writer is just like annoyed with him
[09:01.380 --> 09:02.260]  and whatever.
[09:03.100 --> 09:05.880]  Is he annoyed? Is he annoyed with her personality stuff
[09:05.880 --> 09:07.920]  or is he annoyed with him for unrealized potential?
[09:08.380 --> 09:10.340]  I think I think it's sort of a both.
[09:10.400 --> 09:14.740]  But mostly the it's mostly the just personality stuff.
[09:14.740 --> 09:15.660]  Like a lot of it is.
[09:15.740 --> 09:17.000]  I think at one point he says that.
[09:17.120 --> 09:20.780]  And why I thought of this is that he he looks like he's being ratatouille
[09:20.780 --> 09:22.600]  around the like the floor.
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.460]  I'll tell you, I, I, I, I'm pretty I like the dude.
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.000]  I just think he's one of those guys that like he is the
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.320]  the dictionary definition of his own worst enemy.
[09:35.740 --> 09:37.160]  Oh, 100%. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:37.240 --> 09:39.140]  He gets in his head and he makes dumb.
[09:39.280 --> 09:42.060]  He gets he makes dumb decisions on the court. Yeah.
[09:42.480 --> 09:45.280]  And if he could just get out of his own way, he's so fucking great.
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.700]  Yeah, he wasn't playing great, right?
[09:46.860 --> 09:48.640]  No, he's playing like dog shit up until last night.
[09:48.700 --> 09:49.880]  He played great last night.
[09:50.300 --> 09:54.440]  I think he played great last night through through some of the game. Yeah.
[09:55.580 --> 09:58.180]  Did you feel like he had like a full game where it was like, this is the guy?
[09:58.840 --> 10:00.480]  I had like he's got like 25 points last night.
[10:00.540 --> 10:02.180]  He was like super helpful in the second half.
[10:02.540 --> 10:03.460]  Yeah. In this. Yeah.
[10:03.480 --> 10:04.820]  That's what I was gonna say in the second half.
[10:05.020 --> 10:07.220]  In the in the first half, he was like, not the guy.
[10:07.580 --> 10:10.440]  Also, Geoff, what you're seeing here is more ratatouille,
[10:10.560 --> 10:12.140]  which is just keep doing these.
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.620]  We just did this. Yeah.
[10:13.840 --> 10:16.340]  Three phases of this one task.
[10:16.560 --> 10:17.600]  This is this game.
[10:18.060 --> 10:19.460]  You're just seeing the chef level.
[10:19.460 --> 10:20.800]  We were on a farm.
[10:20.900 --> 10:23.560]  We were in the back alleys of like Paris.
[10:23.720 --> 10:25.280]  We there's a big sewer.
[10:25.480 --> 10:26.660]  We've been everywhere.
[10:27.320 --> 10:29.040]  This game is a hub world, Geoff.
[10:29.160 --> 10:30.380]  Oh, it's it's dude, it's a hub.
[10:30.500 --> 10:32.400]  It's a 2007 ass game. It's crazy.
[10:32.780 --> 10:38.260]  Was there a like a like a stereotypical Paris prostitution and opium dens?
[10:38.460 --> 10:39.320]  No, no, no.
[10:39.340 --> 10:42.160]  There is a little dog that looked kind of like your dog and he chased us.
[10:44.020 --> 10:47.880]  That was kind of implied in the concept art, though, what you're saying.
[10:47.880 --> 10:49.520]  Yeah, that is true of them.
[10:49.620 --> 10:50.360]  I was like, hmm.
[10:50.780 --> 10:54.880]  Yeah. And the other thing you'll see, Geoff, is that Andrew and I think we've talked
[10:54.880 --> 10:57.200]  about this and you've learned it probably recently with them.
[10:57.260 --> 10:58.140]  You talk about it endlessly.
[10:58.400 --> 10:59.900]  You seem very fascinated.
[11:00.380 --> 11:02.980]  Andrew is a bonus content guy.
[11:03.520 --> 11:06.320]  And oh, well, he wants you to see all the bonus content.
[11:06.500 --> 11:07.820]  He wants to see the bonus content.
[11:08.380 --> 11:11.840]  There's no end to the amount of bonus content that this guy would.
[11:11.940 --> 11:13.500]  I don't think I think you could say him.
[11:13.960 --> 11:16.520]  Andrew is a maximum joy kind of guy.
[11:16.520 --> 11:17.300]  Yes, I am.
[11:17.480 --> 11:20.440]  Joy to be extracted from a property.
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.460]  He's going to do what it takes to get it.
[11:22.740 --> 11:26.020]  I just OK, guys, achievement hunter.
[11:26.120 --> 11:29.700]  This is how you get the complete latchkey distraction.
[11:30.580 --> 11:32.320]  Easy achievement just for you.
[11:32.420 --> 11:35.020]  Play through 20 points just for you.
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.360]  See, and Andrew's given a nose nose nose to nose.
[11:40.760 --> 11:41.920]  Well, it's a weird angle.
[11:42.180 --> 11:43.380]  I don't like the angling.
[11:43.540 --> 11:44.660]  I don't like his face.
[11:44.700 --> 11:45.960]  I don't like that he's not blinking.
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.520]  He hasn't. He hasn't blinked.
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.760]  I don't like that the rat is smaller than the key.
[11:52.480 --> 11:53.560]  Well, that's true.
[11:53.840 --> 11:54.780]  That's a huge key.
[11:54.960 --> 11:55.840]  That's a giant.
[11:56.080 --> 11:58.160]  But when was the last time you picked up a key bigger than a rat?
[12:00.100 --> 12:02.220]  This fucking key's bigger than a rat.
[12:02.640 --> 12:05.020]  Can I tell you, I love good food.
[12:05.300 --> 12:08.400]  Pat and Oswald phoning it in.
[12:09.160 --> 12:10.540]  Hey, what can he tell you?
[12:10.720 --> 12:11.660]  Here's a piece of trivia.
[12:11.820 --> 12:15.640]  Do you remember what other video game Pat and Oswald starred in
[12:15.640 --> 12:17.200]  in this era of gaming?
[12:17.600 --> 12:19.980]  A little later, but Disney Infinity.
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.500]  Oh, maybe. Yeah, I was thinking, what?
[12:24.100 --> 12:25.200]  What other game was he in?
[12:25.540 --> 12:29.520]  He was the main character in the Minecraft.
[12:30.800 --> 12:32.820]  Oh, yeah. Telltale series.
[12:33.120 --> 12:34.200]  Oh, weird. Yeah.
[12:34.420 --> 12:36.880]  Yeah. The Minecraft like which I tell the game.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.780]  Oh, Minecraft story on Netflix.
[12:39.000 --> 12:39.780]  Now. Yeah. Yeah.
[12:40.640 --> 12:42.860]  Which I managed to make it through the first episode.
[12:43.740 --> 12:45.360]  Oh, I think a lot of people.
[12:46.460 --> 12:48.980]  Did I think that's that is, I think, the experience,
[12:49.160 --> 12:50.340]  because at least that's what I did.
[12:50.680 --> 12:51.800]  I did not make it past.
[12:52.740 --> 12:57.100]  It's been the whole time, like running around a fair or in your town
[12:57.100 --> 13:01.100]  and trying to, I don't know, collect items or get people to be nice.
[13:01.220 --> 13:02.880]  I remember it was fucking lame.
[13:02.960 --> 13:03.760]  Am I supposed to go?
[13:04.920 --> 13:06.240]  You know what? Your lettuce health?
[13:06.820 --> 13:08.820]  No, I don't. I have full health. I'm good.
[13:09.480 --> 13:11.160]  Oh, he was you would think.
[13:11.940 --> 13:12.460]  Go ahead.
[13:12.620 --> 13:14.560]  I was going to say he did a voice in Vice City Stories
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.360]  where he was like one of like the callers into the show.
[13:18.440 --> 13:19.080]  That's interesting.
[13:20.080 --> 13:22.000]  Are you think this does damage, but it doesn't?
[13:23.180 --> 13:25.360]  Oh, my God. Oh, no, it does.
[13:25.540 --> 13:27.540]  Hey, Geoff, kill you. Hey, Geoff. Oh, shit.
[13:28.260 --> 13:29.760]  OK, well, that's part of the guide.
[13:29.960 --> 13:30.780]  Don't do that.
[13:31.540 --> 13:32.340]  Avoid that.
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.240]  Geoff, that's part of the guide.
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.320]  Don't do that.
[13:36.760 --> 13:38.020]  Oh, my Lord.
[13:38.520 --> 13:39.540]  That was awesome.
[13:39.700 --> 13:40.680]  Man, he is.
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.300]  Yeah, I was just about to ask,
[13:43.300 --> 13:46.600]  are there highlights like important moments from the movie
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.980]  that are highlighted in the game?
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.180]  I don't think so.
[13:49.220 --> 13:52.600]  Because like when he I don't remember the movie, the cheese and Remy
[13:52.600 --> 13:54.200]  discovers it tastes different or anything.
[13:54.340 --> 13:57.500]  No, they kind of like don't explain like you just controlled that guy.
[13:57.660 --> 13:59.980]  And like that's like the first time I think that happens.
[14:00.100 --> 14:01.700]  And like there's no preamble to it or anything.
[14:01.780 --> 14:02.880]  You just sort of like it happened.
[14:03.600 --> 14:04.420]  You just already not.
[14:04.780 --> 14:06.500]  They didn't explain the story here.
[14:06.560 --> 14:07.720]  You're just mid. Yeah.
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.280]  They assume kids are smart enough to figure it out.
[14:10.340 --> 14:11.180]  I appreciate that.
[14:11.180 --> 14:13.960]  Yeah. In 2007, you know, you got it.
[14:14.040 --> 14:15.520]  This is the only game your mom bought for you.
[14:15.600 --> 14:17.840]  This is it. Like, roll this way.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.260]  Jump this way.
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.160]  Great.
[14:28.300 --> 14:29.520]  Oh, right.
[14:30.780 --> 14:33.460]  Wait from the seat, so is that right?
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.040]  I'm going to fucking beat you up or you hit my money.
[14:37.220 --> 14:38.760]  Hit him. Kill him.
[14:40.220 --> 14:42.000]  Oh, he's just so he ain't shit.
[14:42.220 --> 14:43.020]  Yeah, he ain't shit.
[14:43.140 --> 14:43.720]  Now you got him.
[14:44.140 --> 14:47.960]  So the goal is that you're supposed to collect the things in the top, right?
[14:48.140 --> 14:51.500]  These are flower coins, tokens, something like that.
[14:51.960 --> 14:55.060]  And you also have to like do these many games because they unlock stuff.
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.440]  And Andrew is dead set on getting 100% in this game.
[15:00.460 --> 15:01.220]  Well, of course.
[15:02.960 --> 15:05.220]  He's the he's the maximum enjoyment guy.
[15:05.960 --> 15:08.400]  Yeah. I wonder how many people have 100% of this game.
[15:09.140 --> 15:10.520]  Oh, that's a great question.
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.720]  I don't know. We were looking at we were looking at speed runs last time.
[15:15.200 --> 15:17.980]  Was this the game that Jack used to always complain about?
[15:19.920 --> 15:20.880]  I'm like, very.
[15:21.160 --> 15:23.800]  Why would he like like way harder than you would think?
[15:24.080 --> 15:25.700]  Why would he complain about this game?
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.740]  I don't I remember he hated it.
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.240]  It was either maybe it might not have been this game,
[15:29.300 --> 15:30.900]  but it was definitely one of these kind of game.
[15:30.900 --> 15:33.880]  I've been doing cars or something that I thought it was this.
[15:35.920 --> 15:37.720]  OK, there we go, go up.
[15:37.720 --> 15:39.380]  It's nice when the nose actually works.
[15:40.580 --> 15:44.000]  Was that you're like you can turn on like the the yeah, you go.
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.960]  It tells you where to. Yeah, I was thinking about that.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.940]  I was on a bike ride this morning and I was thinking,
[15:48.100 --> 15:49.600]  wouldn't that be cool if you had it in real life?
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.400]  Like if you just needed to know, like what?
[15:51.500 --> 15:54.700]  Not like how do I get to the grocery store?
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.240]  Yeah, but like which direction should I go in?
[15:59.480 --> 16:01.620]  Like, you know, like this way?
[16:01.820 --> 16:06.280]  Yeah, you're you could stick that nose, stick your sniffer in the air
[16:06.280 --> 16:10.440]  and then a blue thing comes out of your head and it goes,
[16:10.880 --> 16:11.640]  go left at this light.
[16:11.740 --> 16:12.720]  And you're like, yeah, he knows.
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.220]  See if he makes it like it's like a fill in an application at this store, bro.
[16:19.720 --> 16:22.440]  There you go. You got a blue one that I don't know is blue,
[16:22.980 --> 16:25.900]  but it didn't it didn't increase our four of 100.
[16:26.040 --> 16:27.520]  No, nothing happened now because it's blue.
[16:27.640 --> 16:29.500]  What was that? What was blue?
[16:30.140 --> 16:32.680]  Yeah. OK, it's a different thing.
[16:33.780 --> 16:37.380]  What? OK.
[16:38.200 --> 16:40.120]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[16:41.580 --> 16:43.680]  Well, there you go.
[16:43.680 --> 16:46.080]  More blue ones. You got to climb across it, dude.
[16:47.520 --> 16:49.200]  Oh, that makes noise.
[16:49.780 --> 16:53.320]  But this is how we actually do our accounting now.
[16:53.840 --> 16:56.540]  Yeah, that's it. And that's why we're going to jailhouse.
[16:57.180 --> 17:01.420]  Oh boy. Everything in this game hurts this mouse.
[17:01.420 --> 17:04.340]  Like he just gets constantly beat up by shit.
[17:04.980 --> 17:07.340]  And I don't know.
[17:07.560 --> 17:12.580]  It's you wouldn't think that a mouse would be so fragile, I suppose.
[17:15.360 --> 17:18.640]  You think the ball is going to get sucked by the thing if I try to?
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.800]  No. Yeah. Yeah.
[17:21.800 --> 17:24.000]  Holy shit, dude, you have to.
[17:24.060 --> 17:26.140]  So you got to climb up there and turn it off before you go.
[17:26.480 --> 17:28.800]  You probably got it. Yeah, you got to do the electronic fence.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.220]  I mean, clearly what I would think, because that's don't worry.
[17:31.220 --> 17:32.820]  He's going to try math on the ball.
[17:33.100 --> 17:36.340]  The game's been heavily implying some math on the ball.
[17:36.580 --> 17:37.420]  You're spilling booze.
[17:37.640 --> 17:39.260]  Geoff, it's been like this the whole time.
[17:39.540 --> 17:40.520]  The game is heavily implied.
[17:40.840 --> 17:42.580]  Yeah, I'm not paying attention to that. All right.
[17:42.980 --> 17:44.280]  Yeah, it's sick. Here we go.
[17:45.620 --> 17:47.180]  Here we go. Here we go.
[17:47.540 --> 17:50.900]  Got to do the electrical climb, the electrical climb.
[17:51.840 --> 17:53.580]  What's that? I'm an electric fence, Geoff.
[17:54.500 --> 17:56.040]  Have I? Yeah.
[17:56.280 --> 17:58.760]  No, I've been electrocuted by them.
[17:59.140 --> 17:59.740]  Have you really?
[17:59.740 --> 18:01.400]  Oh, of course. I grew up.
[18:01.500 --> 18:04.240]  I grew up in fucking Alabama and Mississippi and shit, dude.
[18:04.280 --> 18:06.040]  It's electrical. Fuck me. Country.
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.220]  Is that it's like to keep like a cows in or whatever?
[18:10.400 --> 18:11.120]  Is that the? Yeah.
[18:11.240 --> 18:17.180]  Or like I mean, for like at farms and stuff, it's yeah, it's mostly to keep cattle
[18:17.180 --> 18:21.400]  or whatever out varmint in in the urban environments.
[18:21.500 --> 18:22.860]  It's usually more race.
[18:22.900 --> 18:24.160]  It's usually to keep minorities out.
[18:24.580 --> 18:26.420]  Oh, that makes sense. Yeah.
[18:27.940 --> 18:29.240]  I saw that coming.
[18:29.480 --> 18:31.100]  What? What do you mean? What?
[18:33.980 --> 18:35.260]  Oh, you suck.
[18:35.440 --> 18:37.600]  Got it. Understood.
[18:38.320 --> 18:39.540]  It's got it.
[18:39.680 --> 18:42.100]  It's stunning to me how differently we think, Andrew.
[18:42.300 --> 18:44.240]  I'm just it's impressive to me every time.
[18:44.460 --> 18:45.960]  Oh, oh, oh.
[18:47.840 --> 18:50.080]  Hey, now I go cross. Nailed it.
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.820]  Easy. So what fan shuts off that way?
[18:54.820 --> 18:56.600]  No, that is some bullshit.
[18:56.720 --> 18:58.240]  You know what that's called right there?
[18:58.560 --> 19:00.340]  What? That's called fan service.
[19:02.460 --> 19:05.440]  Oh, oh, we don't.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.320]  Don't boo me. Boo the game. They did it.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.300]  Yeah, that's fine. It's booing the game.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.080]  Don't please don't die.
[19:12.260 --> 19:13.160]  Please don't die from my aunts.
[19:13.620 --> 19:14.600]  Can you eat food?
[19:16.080 --> 19:16.860]  I don't think so.
[19:17.100 --> 19:20.980]  No, he doesn't seem for as much as he likes food and all like that stuff or whatever.
[19:21.080 --> 19:23.620]  He doesn't seem to be like hungry.
[19:24.060 --> 19:25.780]  Yeah, he's just like not eating the food.
[19:25.780 --> 19:26.400]  You know what I mean?
[19:28.840 --> 19:29.980]  That's Brad Garrett, by the way.
[19:33.120 --> 19:33.300]  What?
[19:34.980 --> 19:35.980]  What do you want from me?
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.720]  I've done. I've done your bidding.
[19:41.420 --> 19:43.360]  Maybe you don't need to be on the.
[19:46.040 --> 19:47.540]  What do you want from me?
[19:47.600 --> 19:48.820]  I think you got to roll.
[19:48.860 --> 19:50.280]  I think you got to roll the ball down in there.
[19:51.080 --> 19:51.860]  Yeah, I think you got to roll.
[19:51.860 --> 19:54.420]  You got to be on the ball and jump down in there.
[19:54.860 --> 19:55.840]  There you go.
[19:55.860 --> 19:57.000]  It's game stupid.
[19:57.480 --> 19:58.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[19:58.180 --> 19:59.100]  But now it's stupid.
[19:59.240 --> 19:59.880]  Yeah, you got the green one.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.080]  Why would you put the marker?
[20:03.360 --> 20:08.400]  Dude, that's where you got to go can decimate metal cans.
[20:08.600 --> 20:08.980]  Yes.
[20:10.260 --> 20:10.800]  Oh, shit.
[20:12.100 --> 20:13.500]  But not a puff of air.
[20:13.860 --> 20:14.760]  Oh, thank God.
[20:15.240 --> 20:15.420]  Yep.
[20:15.540 --> 20:15.780]  OK.
[20:19.860 --> 20:23.000]  Oh, oh, oh, goodness.
[20:25.700 --> 20:27.680]  I did not think you were going to make it up there.
[20:27.780 --> 20:28.500]  I really did.
[20:28.600 --> 20:30.480]  No, I was convinced I was going to miss.
[20:30.920 --> 20:31.700]  Oh, shit.
[20:31.920 --> 20:35.960]  So when you jump on balance, you have to press a button to land on it, Geoff.
[20:36.040 --> 20:37.320]  And then sometimes he does that.
[20:37.380 --> 20:38.260]  And sometimes he doesn't.
[20:38.520 --> 20:40.680]  But you have to press a button to land.
[20:40.980 --> 20:44.340]  Yeah, the jump isn't to land on like the blue highlighted thing.
[20:44.360 --> 20:44.500]  Yeah.
[20:44.980 --> 20:45.580]  Oh, goodness.
[20:45.780 --> 20:46.220]  Yeah.
[20:46.360 --> 20:47.060]  What is that?
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.640]  You got to go in and get the thing.
[20:48.700 --> 20:49.400]  Can you use the sniffer?
[20:52.260 --> 20:52.900]  There you go.
[20:53.000 --> 20:53.460]  You went in there.
[20:53.760 --> 20:54.160]  Yeah.
[20:54.220 --> 20:54.860]  And it went away.
[20:55.520 --> 20:56.100]  Yeah, it's gone.
[20:56.340 --> 20:56.800]  I'm in this.
[20:57.020 --> 20:57.220]  OK.
[20:58.960 --> 20:59.780]  But I can just jump.
[20:59.940 --> 21:00.740]  What level is this?
[21:00.780 --> 21:02.120]  Is this level five?
[21:02.280 --> 21:02.420]  Nope.
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.980]  Something like that.
[21:04.040 --> 21:05.220]  Are you guys doing a level an episode?
[21:06.260 --> 21:09.620]  No, we spent like three videos in Paris, I'd say.
[21:09.820 --> 21:14.340]  We tried to and it really we found out that this game is dense.
[21:14.340 --> 21:15.820]  There's too deep.
[21:15.940 --> 21:16.940]  There's too much to do.
[21:17.040 --> 21:17.660]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[21:17.900 --> 21:20.620]  So who what other special guests have appeared on?
[21:21.060 --> 21:21.640]  You're the first.
[21:21.840 --> 21:21.880]  Just you.
[21:22.240 --> 21:22.420]  Yeah.
[21:22.640 --> 21:23.420]  No, no, Nick.
[21:23.740 --> 21:24.160]  Never had a Nick.
[21:24.160 --> 21:27.680]  I think we're going to try to have I think we're going to try to have Nick on maybe the next one.
[21:28.100 --> 21:30.120]  OK, so it's just been you two this whole time.
[21:30.400 --> 21:30.620]  Yeah.
[21:31.040 --> 21:31.240]  Yeah.
[21:31.380 --> 21:32.700]  Just been us ratting.
[21:33.180 --> 21:33.360]  Yep.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.260]  I see why.
[21:34.360 --> 21:38.080]  So you made it about episode five before you needed to bring some new blood in.
[21:38.360 --> 21:38.540]  Yeah.
[21:38.540 --> 21:38.760]  Yeah.
[21:38.780 --> 21:41.180]  Hey, Geoff, I just want to point out that he did not press the button.
[21:42.000 --> 21:42.980]  I hit the button.
[21:43.780 --> 21:45.360]  I hit the I hit B.
[21:45.680 --> 21:46.860]  I don't know what it wanted.
[21:46.960 --> 21:47.860]  I hit B.
[21:48.860 --> 21:49.660]  Oh, my God.
[21:49.720 --> 21:50.720]  I got to go all the way.
[21:50.980 --> 21:53.420]  There's this isn't as bad as you think, though.
[21:54.300 --> 21:55.240]  Yeah, it isn't.
[21:55.300 --> 21:55.720]  This is not.
[21:57.120 --> 21:58.160]  This is the very.
[21:58.340 --> 21:59.380]  What are you getting?
[22:00.240 --> 22:04.120]  Yeah, but you've got all the time that you don't have to do that.
[22:04.180 --> 22:04.820]  That's what I'm saying.
[22:04.840 --> 22:07.260]  It's not as bad as you think because you do that part.
[22:07.380 --> 22:08.580]  Hey, hey, legit.
[22:08.760 --> 22:11.920]  I thought you were climbing that to, like, continue through and do like the whole loop.
[22:11.920 --> 22:13.780]  It did not allow me to climb up and go this way.
[22:13.920 --> 22:14.980]  That freaked me out.
[22:15.060 --> 22:16.200]  I was like, there's no shot, dude.
[22:16.340 --> 22:16.920]  What are you doing?
[22:18.780 --> 22:19.180]  Oh.
[22:20.680 --> 22:21.080]  Perfect.
[22:21.480 --> 22:21.780]  Why?
[22:22.020 --> 22:22.200]  Why?
[22:22.300 --> 22:23.640]  Why is his office like this?
[22:23.820 --> 22:27.360]  Did he, like, had did he like in excess himself or what?
[22:28.540 --> 22:28.940]  Yeah.
[22:29.500 --> 22:32.800]  And that's how you be hoisting the hefty weight.
[22:33.440 --> 22:35.760]  20 G's right there just for you.
[22:36.360 --> 22:36.760]  Incredible.
[22:37.220 --> 22:38.320]  Guys, this is how you get through it.
[22:38.400 --> 22:39.520]  A new sensation.
[22:40.080 --> 22:40.720]  Get a belt.
[22:44.400 --> 22:46.020]  David Carradine, Michael Hutchison.
[22:49.300 --> 22:50.780]  There's a devil inside, guys.
[22:51.280 --> 22:51.760]  Devil inside.
[22:52.040 --> 22:52.300]  Oh, no.
[22:52.480 --> 22:52.980]  Keep it inside.
[22:54.740 --> 22:55.120]  Right.
[22:55.360 --> 22:55.820]  Oh, why?
[22:55.960 --> 22:56.180]  Okay.
[22:56.280 --> 22:57.480]  Yeah, I was trying to remember how.
[22:57.720 --> 22:58.200]  It's been a while.
[22:58.500 --> 22:59.140]  Use your nose.
[22:59.480 --> 23:00.620]  Follow your nose wherever it goes.
[23:01.360 --> 23:01.880]  It didn't do it.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.780]  So we've done all the menu missions.
[23:03.980 --> 23:05.560]  Now I can do side stuff.
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.320]  Also, why is this closed again?
[23:08.740 --> 23:09.700]  I thought we opened it.
[23:09.820 --> 23:11.060]  I thought it must be.
[23:11.120 --> 23:11.560]  Get away.
[23:11.920 --> 23:12.800]  I gotta redo it.
[23:13.300 --> 23:19.780]  So we're just now running around trying to find the 13 revolving fried eggs or whatever.
[23:19.840 --> 23:20.940]  You would think it's easy.
[23:21.240 --> 23:21.780]  It's not.
[23:22.320 --> 23:23.880]  Is that melba toast?
[23:24.000 --> 23:24.440]  What is it?
[23:26.500 --> 23:27.400]  What is what?
[23:27.680 --> 23:28.640]  The like the icons.
[23:29.200 --> 23:30.180]  I think they're like flowers.
[23:30.420 --> 23:31.000]  I don't know.
[23:31.200 --> 23:31.640]  Flowers.
[23:32.220 --> 23:33.400]  I think it looks like a flower.
[23:33.680 --> 23:34.240]  There's different.
[23:35.320 --> 23:36.740]  Are they different from level to level?
[23:36.980 --> 23:38.400]  Or have they always been looking like this?
[23:40.100 --> 23:41.440]  We've collected over 100.
[23:41.440 --> 23:42.820]  So you think we would know.
[23:43.060 --> 23:44.520]  But we only collected 87.
[23:44.700 --> 23:45.820]  It's pretty insignificant detail.
[23:46.820 --> 23:47.900]  I think we get a pass.
[23:48.020 --> 23:51.680]  I mean, I think it's the whole fucking reason we're back in here right now is that detail.
[23:51.980 --> 23:52.080]  Bullshit.
[23:54.780 --> 23:56.200]  Okay, we can do minigames now.
[23:58.040 --> 23:58.760]  Or not.
[23:59.540 --> 24:00.100]  Or not.
[24:00.720 --> 24:01.560]  You piece of shit.
[24:01.900 --> 24:05.500]  Sometimes it's that and you hit B and it says no, I don't want to do it.
[24:05.600 --> 24:05.840]  Uh-huh.
[24:05.940 --> 24:06.360]  Here we go.
[24:07.420 --> 24:08.180]  Oh shit.
[24:08.320 --> 24:08.520]  Okay.
[24:08.880 --> 24:10.360]  So you haven't done this minigame yet?
[24:11.100 --> 24:11.500]  No.
[24:11.700 --> 24:16.160]  So last time we got very confused because there's no indication of what you've done.
[24:16.300 --> 24:16.520]  Yes.
[24:16.640 --> 24:17.420]  And what you haven't.
[24:17.960 --> 24:19.580]  So we haven't done any of the minigames.
[24:19.760 --> 24:21.740]  We've only done the mini missions.
[24:21.980 --> 24:23.280]  We've been trying to stop.
[24:23.420 --> 24:25.760]  We've been trying to hold off because when you start mix,
[24:25.920 --> 24:28.260]  like when you do like a little mixy-moo, that's what I call it.
[24:28.840 --> 24:30.760]  You get really confused.
[24:30.860 --> 24:31.320]  It's tough.
[24:33.100 --> 24:33.880]  Oh shit.
[24:34.080 --> 24:34.700]  Get away, crab.
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.260]  Is the goal here to crush?
[24:37.660 --> 24:38.580]  Are you trying to crush ants?
[24:38.660 --> 24:39.120]  What's the goal?
[24:39.780 --> 24:40.180]  Yes.
[24:40.180 --> 24:41.780]  Bottom left, 7 of 10.
[24:41.920 --> 24:42.580]  Oh, 7 of 10.
[24:42.900 --> 24:45.260]  I was looking at every other corner but bottom left.
[24:45.360 --> 24:46.080]  So thank you very much.
[24:46.100 --> 24:48.180]  Well, there is something in essentially every other corner.
[24:48.380 --> 24:48.840]  There is.
[24:48.900 --> 24:49.440]  That's why I was looking.
[24:49.960 --> 24:51.800]  Dude, that crab is on you, man.
[24:52.200 --> 24:53.240]  But he's not doing anything.
[24:53.440 --> 24:54.040]  He just...
[24:54.040 --> 24:55.600]  Yeah, that's what you said about that guy's feet.
[24:56.320 --> 24:56.900]  That's true.
[24:57.240 --> 24:58.480]  He stomped you to hell in the back.
[24:58.480 --> 24:59.660]  That's a great point by you.
[25:00.840 --> 25:01.560]  Oh, fuck.
[25:01.680 --> 25:02.960]  Okay, where's the last one?
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.400]  Oh, this is where it gets hard.
[25:05.340 --> 25:07.020]  You get bonus if you do it under two minutes.
[25:07.160 --> 25:08.360]  No, you just...
[25:09.420 --> 25:10.900]  You just said under two minutes.
[25:10.980 --> 25:12.100]  I know, I've been saying under a minute.
[25:12.740 --> 25:13.560]  But it was...
[25:13.560 --> 25:14.620]  You just crossed over.
[25:14.760 --> 25:15.280]  You didn't make it.
[25:15.900 --> 25:16.200]  Oh, there.
[25:17.800 --> 25:18.640]  Oh, 10 seconds.
[25:18.760 --> 25:19.160]  Boom.
[25:19.380 --> 25:20.840]  Hell yeah, Reby the cowboy.
[25:21.440 --> 25:22.660]  Yee-haw, we're rooting and tooting.
[25:22.840 --> 25:24.620]  Geoff, give us a root and toot and sort of holler.
[25:24.760 --> 25:25.700]  Yee-haw!
[25:25.980 --> 25:29.520]  We did it because we got third times a charm part two as well, guys.
[25:29.740 --> 25:30.220]  That's how...
[25:30.220 --> 25:34.100]  We are getting these like nobody's business.
[25:34.160 --> 25:36.580]  So easy and you can do it too if you put in
[25:36.580 --> 25:39.740]  Ratatouille 2007 and follow along with us, the Achievement Hunters,
[25:40.260 --> 25:42.540]  to get every achievement in Ratatouille 2007.
[25:42.540 --> 25:43.920]  We don't own that one.
[25:44.240 --> 25:44.500]  Oh.
[25:45.320 --> 25:46.380]  Well, I don't think...
[25:46.380 --> 25:50.120]  I will say I don't think Warner Brothers is going to watch Ratatouille part five.
[25:50.260 --> 25:56.560]  You can say the So All Riders or the Fuck Facers or the Regulators or the NMAX.
[25:57.100 --> 26:00.740]  I probably won't ever say the So All Riders, but maybe the rest of them.
[26:02.020 --> 26:02.600]  The 100%...
[26:02.600 --> 26:03.220]  Whoa!
[26:04.300 --> 26:05.620]  Okay, this is a new one.
[26:05.800 --> 26:06.560]  This is a new one.
[26:06.560 --> 26:07.520]  This is crazy.
[26:07.520 --> 26:10.300]  I know we did this before, but it's not this fast.
[26:11.160 --> 26:12.280]  Oh, that was awesome.
[26:12.800 --> 26:13.540]  Dude, you won.
[26:13.620 --> 26:13.800]  Congrats, you passed one.
[26:14.600 --> 26:15.160]  That was quick.
[26:15.180 --> 26:15.960]  Hey, good job. You did it.
[26:15.960 --> 26:16.660]  Way to go, guys.
[26:17.280 --> 26:18.840]  So now you're up to 97.
[26:19.120 --> 26:20.360]  You just got to get three more.
[26:20.800 --> 26:21.160]  Yeah, but...
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.920]  Yeah, I don't like 97 because that means we're definitely...
[26:23.920 --> 26:24.980]  Yeah, we don't know where they are.
[26:25.120 --> 26:25.160]  ...stuff.
[26:25.560 --> 26:25.920]  That's... yeah.
[26:26.920 --> 26:28.860]  I think you do the rest of the minigames and we'll find them.
[26:28.940 --> 26:29.620]  I bet that's where they are.
[26:30.220 --> 26:31.640]  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[26:31.720 --> 26:33.560]  I'm just trying to run around, look for minigames.
[26:33.900 --> 26:36.480]  And there's no indication how many there are on a level.
[26:37.260 --> 26:38.580]  Not really, no.
[26:38.760 --> 26:40.940]  No, I mean to like... there's like no map or anything.
[26:41.440 --> 26:43.380]  Andrew can show you the stuff that we unlock.
[26:44.200 --> 26:44.520]  Yeah.
[26:44.920 --> 26:45.760]  You know.
[26:46.100 --> 26:47.140]  So there's this.
[26:48.900 --> 26:50.700]  We're halfway in Charms Collected.
[26:50.720 --> 26:51.020]  So we're missing one.
[26:52.040 --> 26:52.700]  That's pretty good.
[26:54.040 --> 26:56.460]  Almost halfway in minigames complete overall.
[26:57.780 --> 26:59.060]  We're making recipes.
[27:00.560 --> 27:01.500]  Who's that?
[27:02.060 --> 27:03.420]  What voice is that?
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.320]  Was it Janine Garofalo?
[27:06.560 --> 27:07.360]  Oh, probably.
[27:07.460 --> 27:10.140]  Like she's on the Ben Stiller show.
[27:10.400 --> 27:11.000]  Show's over.
[27:12.560 --> 27:13.820]  The Ben Stiller show?
[27:14.120 --> 27:14.740]  That just ended?
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.920]  Yeah, it just ended, I think.
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.200]  Oh, that's just over since 93 or whatever.
[27:22.600 --> 27:29.560]  I watched an interview with Bob Odenkirk on Tony Hawk and Jason Ellis.
[27:29.680 --> 27:31.320]  I think it's Jason Ellis's like podcast.
[27:31.980 --> 27:36.020]  And he was talking about doing that show and how it made him want to do Mr. Show
[27:36.020 --> 27:36.560]  and all that stuff.
[27:36.600 --> 27:37.180]  And it was really cool.
[27:37.340 --> 27:38.260]  I like Bob Odenkirk a lot.
[27:38.460 --> 27:39.420]  He almost died.
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.960]  Yeah, he's a cool dude, man.
[27:42.200 --> 27:42.900]  Very funny dude.
[27:43.480 --> 27:43.880]  Hilarious.
[27:44.720 --> 27:45.660]  Oh, cakewalk time!
[27:47.480 --> 27:48.240]  Run, Ronnie, Run.
[27:48.820 --> 27:51.240]  God, somebody used to watch Run, Ronnie, Run over and over again.
[27:51.380 --> 27:51.580]  That was...
[27:51.580 --> 27:52.080]  Wow, really?
[27:52.560 --> 27:53.940]  Yeah, that was our movie together.
[27:54.480 --> 27:54.900]  That's funny.
[27:56.420 --> 28:02.300]  The idea that of a character who's born British but without an accent is still to this day
[28:03.020 --> 28:04.920]  the funniest fucking thing to me.
[28:04.980 --> 28:05.580]  I don't know why.
[28:09.960 --> 28:12.120]  Oh, that's so good.
[28:12.640 --> 28:13.700]  That's so funny.
[28:16.300 --> 28:17.260]  Oh, fuck!
[28:17.380 --> 28:17.680]  Don't die.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.320]  This is when it starts getting crazy.
[28:19.320 --> 28:19.900]  Look out!
[28:20.300 --> 28:20.540]  Yeah.
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.980]  Don't worry, there's still a minute and 10 seconds left of this.
[28:25.860 --> 28:27.240]  Do you have to stay alive the whole time?
[28:27.720 --> 28:28.200]  Yes.
[28:28.980 --> 28:29.520]  Oh, goodness.
[28:30.240 --> 28:31.360]  It's so long.
[28:31.500 --> 28:32.280]  It's pretty brutal.
[28:34.340 --> 28:35.140]  Oh, okay.
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.260]  Is it one of those things where if you don't get on the first try, you get frustrated,
[28:41.500 --> 28:42.760]  and then you start to make mistakes?
[28:42.960 --> 28:46.720]  I love that it looks like one of those paintings that has Jesus in the clouds.
[28:50.320 --> 28:52.800]  Is In Living Color worth revisiting?
[28:53.440 --> 28:54.460]  If you've never watched it?
[28:56.480 --> 28:57.540]  I would say...
[28:57.540 --> 28:58.440]  Jamie Foxx is in it.
[28:58.440 --> 28:59.160]  I would say...
[29:00.260 --> 29:01.640]  Honestly, I would say...
[29:02.460 --> 29:05.920]  David Allen Greer is probably the funniest fucking person, so I'd say with that.
[29:06.780 --> 29:13.080]  I would say no, because I find most sketch comedy to be largely...
[29:15.360 --> 29:17.600]  only relevant in the moment.
[29:17.860 --> 29:18.820]  Sure, yes, yeah.
[29:18.900 --> 29:22.360]  I find it's the stuff that translates the least.
[29:22.360 --> 29:23.000]  Oh, my god.
[29:23.540 --> 29:25.300]  Yeah, you lose a lot of...
[29:25.300 --> 29:27.220]  Like, they're making references to stuff from 1991.
[29:27.220 --> 29:29.140]  So, well before...
[29:29.140 --> 29:31.520]  I assume well before you were born, so...
[29:31.520 --> 29:31.780]  Yes.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.680]  It's like when you're watching Bugs Bunny, and they're making brill cream jokes.
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.900]  Honestly, if you're gonna re-watch In Living Color, you should do it with Gracie.
[29:41.820 --> 29:43.120]  It's just two people...
[29:43.120 --> 29:43.440]  Oh, no.
[29:43.860 --> 29:45.840]  Two people that have no idea.
[29:46.120 --> 29:47.860]  Going, what are they talking about?
[29:48.200 --> 29:49.240]  What are they referencing?
[29:49.800 --> 29:50.760]  I think that would be great.
[29:51.440 --> 29:55.760]  Now, was Blank Man a character on In Living Color before it was a movie?
[29:55.980 --> 29:56.800]  Or was it just a movie?
[29:56.800 --> 29:57.800]  I don't think so.
[29:57.920 --> 30:00.520]  I think... I think it was just the movie.
[30:02.020 --> 30:07.840]  Now, if you wanted to watch something of that flavor, and kind of of that time...
[30:07.840 --> 30:08.160]  Andrew, I do have a recommendation.
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.580]  What am I supposed to do?
[30:10.980 --> 30:11.980]  Well... Andrew's lost again.
[30:11.980 --> 30:12.580]  Sorry, go ahead.
[30:13.100 --> 30:14.740]  Keenan Ivory Wayans made a movie...
[30:14.740 --> 30:15.560]  Well, I don't know if it was...
[30:15.560 --> 30:16.520]  I think it was him who made it.
[30:16.700 --> 30:19.700]  Made a movie in the late 80s called Hollywood Shuffle.
[30:20.120 --> 30:23.600]  That has got almost all of the cast from In Living Color in it.
[30:24.960 --> 30:25.220]  And...
[30:25.220 --> 30:25.720]  Oh, interesting.
[30:25.720 --> 30:28.100]  Like the entire cast except for probably Jim Carrey is in it.
[30:28.420 --> 30:33.800]  And it's just about a dude trying to make a film or figure it out.
[30:33.920 --> 30:36.840]  And it's got a lot of like the DNA of In Living Color in it.
[30:36.880 --> 30:39.780]  Like a lot of the skits and stuff come from the movie.
[30:40.760 --> 30:44.160]  It's kind of like a... almost like a Kentucky Fried movie or like...
[30:44.540 --> 30:45.680]  Like that kind of movie.
[30:46.620 --> 30:49.320]  And it's really, really, really, really fucking good.
[30:49.420 --> 30:51.640]  And you'll recognize so many people in it.
[30:51.800 --> 30:53.960]  And there's so many like little jokes you'll hear.
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.480]  And you go like, oh, I guess that's where that came from.
[30:55.720 --> 30:56.400]  Mm-hmm.
[30:56.840 --> 30:58.340]  I didn't know Dom Herrera wrote a skit.
[30:58.340 --> 31:01.040]  How is there 45 seconds left of this?
[31:02.100 --> 31:02.740]  Oh, my God.
[31:04.940 --> 31:05.740]  Holy fuck.
[31:06.620 --> 31:07.420]  Holy fuck.
[31:07.560 --> 31:08.120]  You're doing great.
[31:08.300 --> 31:08.960]  This is so crazy.
[31:08.960 --> 31:09.900]  Oh, my God.
[31:10.060 --> 31:11.480]  This is so crazy.
[31:11.580 --> 31:12.680]  Oh, my God.
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.060]  This is for children.
[31:15.580 --> 31:15.820]  Oh!
[31:17.400 --> 31:18.820]  What were you saying about Dom Herrera?
[31:19.640 --> 31:21.280]  Dom Herrera wrote...
[31:21.280 --> 31:22.500]  He was one of the writers on Hollywood Shuffle.
[31:22.540 --> 31:23.200]  I didn't realize that.
[31:23.320 --> 31:24.080]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[31:24.400 --> 31:24.540]  Yeah.
[31:24.540 --> 31:30.340]  I think he was involved in like a lot of Kean-Ivory Wayne stuff and Robert Townsend.
[31:30.920 --> 31:32.600]  Robert Townsend is so cool.
[31:32.780 --> 31:33.460]  I like that dude a lot.
[31:33.800 --> 31:38.620]  Also, did you know, I think Jim Carrey is credited as James Carrey on In Living Color,
[31:38.680 --> 31:39.120]  which is funny.
[31:39.340 --> 31:40.140]  Oh, that's interesting.
[31:40.340 --> 31:40.900]  Yeah, it's weird, right?
[31:40.900 --> 31:44.000]  I think I watched a Robert Townsend movie yesterday.
[31:44.200 --> 31:44.820]  Was it Meteor Man?
[31:45.740 --> 31:47.160]  No, it was Mighty Quinn.
[31:48.340 --> 31:49.420]  Is this the same guy?
[31:49.700 --> 31:50.100]  Dude, hang on.
[31:50.140 --> 31:51.480]  You did all that for a fucking egg?
[31:53.540 --> 31:55.900]  Listen, egg prices are high right now.
[31:56.220 --> 31:57.460]  This is the world we live in.
[31:57.520 --> 32:00.300]  Yes, he is. He is the guy from Mighty Quinn.
[32:01.800 --> 32:03.780]  Okay, that's my only point of reference.
[32:04.100 --> 32:07.800]  And I was very confused because isn't Robert Townsend also a rock guy?
[32:09.140 --> 32:09.540]  No.
[32:10.980 --> 32:13.640]  A rock guy? Isn't there someone who's Robert Townsend?
[32:13.840 --> 32:15.120]  What do you mean? Like he hangs out with The Rock?
[32:15.440 --> 32:16.780]  Oh, am I thinking of Pete Townsend?
[32:16.780 --> 32:17.820]  You're thinking of Pete Townsend.
[32:17.860 --> 32:18.180]  Yeah.
[32:18.500 --> 32:18.940]  Yeah.
[32:19.120 --> 32:19.540]  Oh, I see.
[32:19.540 --> 32:21.460]  I was watching it going like, is there a museum?
[32:21.460 --> 32:22.680]  Is there a musician in this movie?
[32:22.940 --> 32:26.660]  And then came to the conclusion, I figured out who Robert Townsend is.
[32:27.120 --> 32:28.420]  And I don't think he does music.
[32:29.440 --> 32:30.140]  That's crazy.
[32:30.460 --> 32:32.680]  I've never heard of Robert Townsend until yesterday.
[32:32.980 --> 32:34.220]  And now here we are talking about him.
[32:34.420 --> 32:35.520]  Isn't the universe weird that way?
[32:36.080 --> 32:36.340]  Yep.
[32:36.800 --> 32:37.420]  It is weird.
[32:37.680 --> 32:40.080]  I probably haven't thought about Robert Townsend in 10 years.
[32:40.440 --> 32:40.880]  Yeah, right.
[32:41.460 --> 32:43.260]  And I wouldn't have if you hadn't mentioned In Living Color.
[32:45.280 --> 32:49.580]  Oh, where's the other one?
[32:49.640 --> 32:50.200]  Oh, it's over there.
[32:53.020 --> 32:53.720]  Excuse me.
[32:53.880 --> 32:55.680]  That's how the knives go in a kitchen, yeah.
[32:59.420 --> 33:02.400]  I'm trying to figure out what we're supposed to do with these doors.
[33:03.260 --> 33:03.860]  The rat doors?
[33:04.560 --> 33:06.820]  Yeah, they're still like, no.
[33:08.580 --> 33:09.520]  No use for them.
[33:09.760 --> 33:12.540]  I thought you were supposed to like hide in them earlier, but and like maybe they were
[33:12.540 --> 33:13.660]  just for something else.
[33:13.800 --> 33:15.220]  Oh yeah, where you pop in and out.
[33:15.380 --> 33:16.680]  Yeah, there is that mini game.
[33:19.300 --> 33:20.340]  Okay, we did that.
[33:22.100 --> 33:23.940]  You ever seen Meteor Man, Geoff?
[33:24.980 --> 33:25.800]  Uh, I don't.
[33:26.300 --> 33:26.860]  Let me look.
[33:26.940 --> 33:28.220]  I know the name, but I can't.
[33:30.660 --> 33:31.700]  I don't think so.
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.560]  I think it looked bad.
[33:33.220 --> 33:33.560]  It did.
[33:33.760 --> 33:34.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:34.920 --> 33:36.320]  And I watched it and it was bad.
[33:37.820 --> 33:39.780]  Had Eddie Griffin in it and Don Cheadle though.
[33:40.380 --> 33:41.540]  Has James Earl Jones also.
[33:43.640 --> 33:44.360]  Robert Guillet.
[33:44.820 --> 33:45.300]  Uh, I don't.
[33:45.560 --> 33:47.280]  Yeah, I think this might have been like the...
[33:47.280 --> 33:48.900]  Oh, maybe the first thing.
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.260]  Yeah, I think this is like the first thing you did.
[33:50.260 --> 33:53.300]  And Sinbad and Bill Cosby.
[33:53.800 --> 33:54.680]  Sinbad, Luther Vandross.
[33:55.240 --> 33:58.140]  Uh, Sinbad in a lot of stuff and then not in a lot of stuff anymore.
[33:58.340 --> 33:58.640]  Maybe...
[33:58.640 --> 33:59.060]  Yeah.
[34:00.320 --> 34:01.500]  He had a stroke, right?
[34:02.240 --> 34:02.840]  Is that right?
[34:02.860 --> 34:03.380]  I didn't know that.
[34:04.040 --> 34:07.260]  Yeah, I think I saw him walk on stage for something recently.
[34:07.400 --> 34:07.560]  Oh.
[34:07.960 --> 34:10.880]  And he's like a little rough, but like everyone was like, yeah, he's here.
[34:12.500 --> 34:13.300]  He had a...
[34:13.300 --> 34:14.660]  I'll tell you what he did have a stroke of.
[34:14.800 --> 34:16.680]  Luck getting cast in Jingle All The Way.
[34:16.760 --> 34:19.600]  That is an awesome, awesome instant classic of a film.
[34:19.600 --> 34:20.120]  One of my favorite.
[34:25.560 --> 34:28.600]  Could you look up Sinbad in?
[34:29.900 --> 34:30.740]  Stroke of Luck.
[34:31.000 --> 34:32.180]  What's it called? No.
[34:32.620 --> 34:33.140]  Stroke of Heart.
[34:33.940 --> 34:35.320]  It's a PSA he did.
[34:35.860 --> 34:36.540]  Sinbad PSA.
[34:36.540 --> 34:37.380]  About safe sex.
[34:37.940 --> 34:38.940]  Sinbad as a condom.
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.280]  Hilarious HIV AIDS PSA.
[34:41.280 --> 34:42.080]  Oh my God.
[34:42.080 --> 34:44.760]  Thanks. Post a photo of that for Eric to see.
[34:45.040 --> 34:46.600]  I just looked it up, but I got it.
[34:47.340 --> 34:47.640]  Okay.
[34:48.100 --> 34:48.440]  Yeah.
[34:50.520 --> 34:53.660]  I tweeted that at Sinbad and he replied, what did he say?
[34:53.920 --> 34:55.000]  No! Did you really?
[34:55.220 --> 34:55.660]  I don't remember.
[34:56.200 --> 34:59.400]  Yeah, it was a long time ago because I watched that whole PSA.
[35:00.020 --> 35:00.660]  It's great.
[35:02.320 --> 35:03.780]  Um, I don't remember what I said.
[35:06.060 --> 35:07.040]  I don't remember what he said.
[35:07.080 --> 35:08.820]  I don't remember what I said, but he acknowledged it.
[35:08.880 --> 35:09.360]  And I was like, what?
[35:09.440 --> 35:09.980]  And what the fuck?
[35:10.060 --> 35:10.580]  What is this?
[35:10.760 --> 35:11.540]  Can you imagine...
[35:11.540 --> 35:12.220]  Jingle All The Way guy.
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.780]  Can you imagine having the kind of life that Andrew has, Eric,
[35:15.780 --> 35:20.320]  where you could interact with Sinbad and not remember either side of the conversation?
[35:21.260 --> 35:21.760]  I mean, really?
[35:23.320 --> 35:24.980]  But he is the star of the show.
[35:25.100 --> 35:27.080]  I did not expect to see Sinbad as a condom.
[35:27.920 --> 35:28.940]  Shit talking people.
[35:30.700 --> 35:32.900]  Tom Cruise is in that. It's very weird.
[35:35.200 --> 35:38.980]  Urkel raps about ejaculation.
[35:40.700 --> 35:41.620]  It's great.
[35:42.640 --> 35:43.600]  Getting demonetized.
[35:43.600 --> 35:44.340]  Content's under pressure.
[35:44.780 --> 35:45.700]  I just might blow.
[35:46.100 --> 35:46.800]  No, stop.
[35:47.800 --> 35:49.740]  Find the last three things.
[35:50.340 --> 35:52.500]  I'm trying to figure out how to get back up there.
[35:52.780 --> 35:54.500]  I don't remember how to get there.
[35:55.780 --> 35:58.140]  Geoff, you think NBA on TNT is done or what?
[36:00.200 --> 36:01.240]  Uh, I...
[36:01.860 --> 36:02.900]  Yeah, I do.
[36:03.100 --> 36:04.300]  I genuinely do.
[36:04.440 --> 36:05.180]  And it's sad.
[36:05.420 --> 36:05.980]  It's heartbreaking.
[36:07.920 --> 36:10.420]  Because it's, uh, you know, unnecessary.
[36:11.020 --> 36:12.740]  But I don't think Ernie...
[36:12.740 --> 36:14.840]  Ernie is on record as saying he'll never leave TNT.
[36:15.840 --> 36:16.560]  Is that right?
[36:17.020 --> 36:19.960]  Yeah, I think he'll just do baseball and hockey.
[36:20.600 --> 36:22.160]  He does those as well.
[36:22.680 --> 36:26.180]  And I don't think the other guys are going to want to do it without him.
[36:26.540 --> 36:27.500]  I'm pretty sure Charles won't.
[36:28.040 --> 36:28.800]  No, definitely won't.
[36:28.800 --> 36:30.260]  He and Ernie are so fucking close.
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.260]  I think he said that he planned on retiring anyway within the next year or two.
[36:37.800 --> 36:38.520]  I think you're right.
[36:38.520 --> 36:41.980]  So it just doesn't make sense to leave and then start a new thing.
[36:42.480 --> 36:42.780]  In his eyes.
[36:42.840 --> 36:44.080]  Thieves take, cooks make.
[36:44.220 --> 36:44.920]  Watch out for the thieves.
[36:45.240 --> 36:47.080]  I will say, though, NBA...
[36:47.080 --> 36:48.540]  If NBC gets it...
[36:48.540 --> 36:50.660]  NBC was awesome when they had the NBA.
[36:50.900 --> 36:51.830]  And the NBA was awesome when...
[36:52.820 --> 36:56.960]  under NBA's, uh, I don't know, contract.
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.440]  It, uh...
[36:58.440 --> 36:58.900]  That's so creepy.
[36:59.620 --> 37:01.430]  It will be interesting to see some new life...
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.340]  bled into it, you know?
[37:03.440 --> 37:03.680]  What?
[37:04.620 --> 37:05.580]  Why is he dead?
[37:05.740 --> 37:07.500]  Are you in hell or heaven?
[37:07.860 --> 37:08.400]  What is this?
[37:11.280 --> 37:11.840]  I...
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.900]  I don't know.
[37:13.520 --> 37:16.000]  Are we in Andy's bedroom from Toy Story?
[37:20.860 --> 37:23.240]  Why do we set up in Andy's room?
[37:26.580 --> 37:27.240]  That's very funny.
[37:28.460 --> 37:30.780]  Also, just look at the rat animations.
[37:31.480 --> 37:32.520]  They're insane.
[37:32.660 --> 37:34.240]  Fucking yank it in his hair!
[37:34.380 --> 37:36.600]  He's just yanking so fucking hard.
[37:36.600 --> 37:40.180]  This is a live look at how me and Andrew play this video game.
[37:43.800 --> 37:46.820]  He's chopping and screwing, and I'm pulling on his fucking hair.
[37:47.020 --> 37:47.800]  Andrew, go left.
[37:48.200 --> 37:49.280]  Andrew, go left.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.180]  Oh, the cutting motion.
[37:53.520 --> 37:54.140]  Oh, man.
[37:55.180 --> 37:58.020]  The wailing he does with that knife is insane.
[37:58.620 --> 37:58.800]  Yeah.
[37:59.160 --> 37:59.860]  All right.
[38:00.220 --> 38:00.580]  Cool, Geoff.
[38:00.860 --> 38:03.660]  Who's the big beefy rat, by the way, that was helping you earlier?
[38:03.840 --> 38:05.580]  I have no idea, but I like him.
[38:07.080 --> 38:08.700]  Have we got to do it two more times?
[38:11.800 --> 38:14.000]  It gets harder each time, or...?
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.020]  I don't think so.
[38:15.340 --> 38:16.220]  His name is Git.
[38:16.840 --> 38:17.860]  G-I-T.
[38:18.020 --> 38:19.500]  Oh, that's cool.
[38:19.540 --> 38:20.340]  Who voices Git?
[38:21.300 --> 38:21.740]  I don't know.
[38:22.760 --> 38:23.600]  We'll find out.
[38:24.040 --> 38:25.700]  I bet you they're cheap on Cameo.
[38:27.900 --> 38:28.780]  Jake Steinfeld.
[38:31.520 --> 38:32.740]  Oh, my God.
[38:34.540 --> 38:34.960]  What?
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.980]  Do you know who Jake Steinfeld is?
[38:37.420 --> 38:38.720]  Haley Steinfeld's brother?
[38:40.500 --> 38:42.980]  Geoff, do you remember Body by Jake?
[38:43.760 --> 38:44.360]  No!
[38:45.340 --> 38:45.820]  Dude!
[38:46.800 --> 38:47.280]  No!
[38:47.380 --> 38:48.360]  That's him!
[38:49.900 --> 38:51.340]  No way!
[38:52.380 --> 38:53.040]  No!
[38:53.680 --> 38:54.400]  Dude!
[38:55.340 --> 38:57.220]  I loved that guy when I was a kid.
[38:57.660 --> 38:58.440]  Yeah, me too!
[38:58.940 --> 39:00.780]  Body by Jake was...
[39:00.780 --> 39:02.180]  What would you describe it as?
[39:02.180 --> 39:05.200]  He would have, like, a half-hour fitness show?
[39:05.520 --> 39:07.000]  Fitness guru shit.
[39:08.000 --> 39:08.560]  That was...
[39:08.560 --> 39:10.120]  Body by Jake was, like, his...
[39:10.120 --> 39:11.360]  That was, like, his brand.
[39:11.720 --> 39:13.580]  Was being, like, a big jacked dude.
[39:13.820 --> 39:16.900]  And then he started doing...
[39:18.100 --> 39:21.680]  Okay, so he started as a personal trainer with clients,
[39:21.780 --> 39:24.160]  including Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford,
[39:24.260 --> 39:28.200]  whom he trained for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade.
[39:28.600 --> 39:30.240]  Man, Steven Spielberg can't lift shit.
[39:30.860 --> 39:31.740]  What kind of trainer is he?
[39:33.120 --> 39:36.020]  Yeah, so he...
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.960]  Yeah, he wrote books, and he was just, you know...
[39:39.960 --> 39:40.560]  Hey, get...
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.020]  You know, get in charge of your life, like that kind of shit.
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.400]  And he was just, like, a big jacked dude that was just sort of...
[39:50.880 --> 39:51.860]  I don't even know what you...
[39:51.860 --> 39:53.580]  Famous in the zeitgeist, I guess?
[39:53.700 --> 39:54.620]  Yeah, he was, like...
[39:54.620 --> 39:56.740]  He was, like, daytime TV famous.
[39:57.080 --> 39:57.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[39:58.940 --> 40:01.720]  He would be, like, on talk shows.
[40:01.740 --> 40:04.380]  For, like, Sally Jesse or whatever, with, like, fitness.
[40:04.720 --> 40:07.240]  Or, like, you know, they'd be, like, the Today Show, and they'd have, like...
[40:07.240 --> 40:09.720]  And then Body by Jake is gonna come, and he's gonna show us some exercises
[40:09.720 --> 40:11.100]  we can do in our own living room.
[40:11.700 --> 40:11.900]  Oh!
[40:13.760 --> 40:16.960]  It is very Richard Simmons-esque, in that way.
[40:17.020 --> 40:17.220]  Okay.
[40:17.520 --> 40:18.420]  You're definitely right.
[40:22.120 --> 40:25.200]  I'm trying to remember if we've done this twice, or if this is the first one.
[40:25.300 --> 40:26.200]  I think we're done.
[40:28.720 --> 40:29.040]  Second...
[40:29.040 --> 40:30.860]  No, that's it, third. That's the third one. You win.
[40:32.340 --> 40:33.100]  I win.
[40:35.920 --> 40:36.320]  Hey!
[40:36.540 --> 40:37.060]  Did you do that before?
[40:37.340 --> 40:40.100]  You... you are the one who wanted to 100% this fucking thing.
[40:40.680 --> 40:41.360]  You can't.
[40:41.940 --> 40:44.160]  It made me really happy when the first one came out.
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.940]  People were like, yeah, they should 100% it.
[40:46.120 --> 40:46.720]  It was a joke.
[40:46.940 --> 40:49.500]  Not knowing that we had five in the can already.
[40:49.620 --> 40:52.020]  We got... yeah, we got really lucky that people liked it,
[40:52.080 --> 40:55.540]  because if they didn't, they were about to fucking hate us for about 9.4%.
[40:59.160 --> 41:00.840]  I don't know what we accomplished.
[41:00.840 --> 41:03.060]  But let's move on to the next one.
[41:03.160 --> 41:06.960]  Well, you didn't get your three fucking Melba toasts, that's for sure.
[41:07.160 --> 41:08.420]  Oh, wait, that's what it's caramel.
[41:08.880 --> 41:09.400]  Is that it?
[41:09.860 --> 41:10.700]  That's what we got.
[41:10.800 --> 41:11.720]  It's a little piece of caramel.
[41:12.020 --> 41:13.120]  It looks just like that picture.
[41:13.260 --> 41:14.180]  No, no, he's sticky.
[41:14.340 --> 41:16.660]  He's putting his little rat feet all inside the caramel.
[41:17.160 --> 41:17.940]  Look at this.
[41:20.820 --> 41:21.920]  Show Gavin this.
[41:25.540 --> 41:27.620]  Need him popping off in the middle of the video.
[41:27.900 --> 41:29.540]  You think Nick mentions the rat feet?
[41:29.800 --> 41:30.200]  Absolutely.
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.280]  Oh, the arches are the best part, the rat feet.
[41:35.080 --> 41:36.900]  The arches are the best part.
[41:38.300 --> 41:44.280]  Oh, Andrew, did you end up getting Little Caesar's new Crazy Puff Mac and Cheese?
[41:44.500 --> 41:44.880]  What the fuck?
[41:44.960 --> 41:51.280]  No, I thought about it today, and it's just like I need to prepare myself mentally for that day.
[41:51.660 --> 41:53.560]  Have you guys had those Crazy Puffs before?
[41:53.660 --> 41:55.340]  Not that Mac and Cheese one, just the regular.
[41:55.480 --> 41:56.180]  They're fucking good.
[41:56.660 --> 41:58.920]  Yeah, they're just the Italian cheese bread.
[41:59.640 --> 42:02.820]  But it's like stuffed, like the ones that are like stuffed with pepperoni.
[42:02.960 --> 42:03.620]  Ooh, I love that.
[42:04.960 --> 42:06.880]  I just don't think they're that different.
[42:07.740 --> 42:08.500]  Maybe not in Canada.
[42:09.080 --> 42:10.360]  In America, it's a whole other level.
[42:10.420 --> 42:12.380]  It's not something I'd probably order from Little Caesar's a lot.
[42:12.480 --> 42:15.760]  Do you not have the Italian cheese bread from them?
[42:16.300 --> 42:21.120]  I feel like all the excitement about the Crazy Puffs are people that are Little Caesar's casuals,
[42:21.120 --> 42:21.720]  in my opinion.
[42:22.840 --> 42:26.560]  They haven't experienced the variety of the Little Caesar's menu.
[42:26.560 --> 42:30.020]  They are just a re-skinned cheese bread that they do.
[42:30.440 --> 42:31.240]  I don't know, man.
[42:31.720 --> 42:32.740]  I don't agree with that either.
[42:32.860 --> 42:38.260]  My wife lives on the sides menu at pizza restaurants, and she is all about them.
[42:39.320 --> 42:44.060]  Well, they're great, but they're not like crazy, inventive new thing.
[42:44.200 --> 42:46.600]  I mean, crazy's in the fucking name, so I think they are.
[42:47.400 --> 42:48.260]  I don't think so.
[42:49.560 --> 42:55.660]  I think crazy bread is like maybe the most inappropriate use of crazy I've ever seen.
[42:55.660 --> 42:57.000]  Yeah, that's about right.
[42:59.040 --> 42:59.860]  And I like it.
[42:59.920 --> 43:00.380]  I'm a fan.
[43:00.640 --> 43:04.680]  I support it, but I think the puffs are overrated.
[43:06.060 --> 43:10.440]  Can somebody, if you're watching this online, can somebody find a high-res
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.660]  pull of that upper left Ratatouille portrait and send it to me, please?
[43:15.980 --> 43:18.100]  Don't just take a screenshot of this and send it to me.
[43:18.140 --> 43:18.700]  I'll block you.
[43:18.760 --> 43:23.400]  If you can find the high-res version of that portrait, that would be phenomenal.
[43:23.400 --> 43:26.280]  Look at, uh, is that your next tattoo, Eric?
[43:26.820 --> 43:29.840]  No, I would never get a Ratatouille tattooie.
[43:32.300 --> 43:33.980]  Oh, there's a Game Boy Advance game?
[43:34.200 --> 43:34.580]  Whoa.
[43:35.340 --> 43:36.300]  Probably a lot of them.
[43:36.940 --> 43:37.660]  There's a whole console.
[43:39.780 --> 43:41.340]  Game Boy Advance Ratatouille.
[43:42.860 --> 43:44.040]  That's very funny, Geoff.
[43:44.780 --> 43:45.200]  Thank you.
[43:45.780 --> 43:47.900]  It looks more like what I expected.
[43:50.340 --> 43:53.360]  Oh my god, it's, like, dancing games?
[43:53.480 --> 43:56.940]  Is it, is it like a side-scroller, that Game Boy one?
[43:57.220 --> 43:57.760]  Yes, it is.
[43:58.520 --> 43:58.800]  Okay.
[43:59.420 --> 44:06.580]  But, they also, but they also have mini-games, uh, where you are trying to
[44:06.580 --> 44:08.780]  cut, like, sort of like the one that you were doing there.
[44:09.740 --> 44:17.840]  But then also, they have a top-down roll-in-the-orange-around mini-game.
[44:17.840 --> 44:19.180]  Heh heh heh.
[44:19.640 --> 44:21.120]  Top-down Game Boy Advance?
[44:21.320 --> 44:22.060]  Fucking insane.
[44:22.320 --> 44:23.140]  That's crazy.
[44:23.500 --> 44:24.340]  That's really cool.
[44:26.280 --> 44:28.360]  What a, what a, what a nuts move.
[44:29.360 --> 44:30.340]  That is crazy.
[44:30.520 --> 44:31.980]  Oh, that's so weird, that perspective.
[44:32.420 --> 44:32.560]  Yep.
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.940]  Geoff, what was your favorite Game Boy Advance game?
[44:35.020 --> 44:35.260]  Go ahead.
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.600]  Uh, probably WarioWare.
[44:39.640 --> 44:40.040]  Really?
[44:40.480 --> 44:41.840]  Yeah, I liked WarioWare a lot.
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.060]  Played the shit out of that, first one.
[44:44.120 --> 44:46.120]  Any reason you were just like, I'm about this?
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.820]  The little mini-games were so much fun, you know?
[44:49.000 --> 44:50.400]  It's like, you play for like four seconds.
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.900]  You're like, pick the nose, okay, do the next thing.
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.580]  Jump over the flag, or whatever.
[44:53.680 --> 44:53.940]  I was just, I don't know.
[44:53.940 --> 44:54.640]  Was that a DS?
[44:55.760 --> 44:56.680]  Was it a DS game?
[44:56.740 --> 44:57.420]  I thought it was Game Boy Advance.
[44:58.440 --> 44:59.180]  Maybe it is.
[44:59.560 --> 45:00.720]  Did you touch the screen in it?
[45:00.720 --> 45:02.540]  I never had a DS, so it couldn't have been.
[45:03.060 --> 45:03.860]  Oh, there you go.
[45:06.640 --> 45:07.160]  How about you?
[45:10.140 --> 45:13.120]  Uh, Fire Pro Wrestling for the Game Boy Advance, probably my favorite.
[45:13.360 --> 45:13.900]  That was a great game.
[45:15.800 --> 45:17.380]  Fire Pro Wrestling?
[45:17.960 --> 45:18.760]  Yeah, there's a lot.
[45:18.800 --> 45:20.220]  I remember playing that.
[45:23.120 --> 45:24.040]  Yeah, this is it.
[45:24.300 --> 45:26.840]  WarioWare for the Game Boy Advance.
[45:27.080 --> 45:28.180]  Yeah, came out in 2003.
[45:28.860 --> 45:29.200]  Hell yeah.
[45:29.320 --> 45:29.700]  Oh, wow.
[45:30.920 --> 45:33.540]  I think my introduction to that would have been the DS then.
[45:33.980 --> 45:36.900]  Because I remember like pulling the nose hairs, and that was a lot of fun on the DS.
[45:37.280 --> 45:38.120]  The interactive screen.
[45:42.220 --> 45:43.060]  What did I don't?
[45:43.060 --> 45:44.800]  You're still three short.
[45:45.020 --> 45:46.240]  This does not end.
[45:48.800 --> 45:51.520]  Uh, did we do all those mini games already?
[45:52.240 --> 45:54.740]  It's the problem when we take like two weeks between these.
[45:55.820 --> 45:59.920]  So we've done all the Jack things.
[46:00.700 --> 46:02.380]  Jack, Geoff's friend, Jack?
[46:02.640 --> 46:05.220]  You've definitely done all of our friends, Jack.
[46:05.800 --> 46:07.980]  Uh, ex-co-worker Jack.
[46:08.700 --> 46:08.960]  Yes.
[46:11.200 --> 46:11.720]  Let's.
[46:12.780 --> 46:13.900]  I guess I'll do the menu.
[46:14.020 --> 46:16.660]  The other menu is the main story mission.
[46:17.140 --> 46:17.280]  Yeah.
[46:18.200 --> 46:19.920]  Maybe we definitely haven't done it.
[46:20.140 --> 46:20.300]  Yeah.
[46:20.560 --> 46:21.040]  Yeah, maybe.
[46:22.440 --> 46:24.880]  I mean, it has to at least explain the doors.
[46:27.340 --> 46:30.540]  I think we do this and we get those coins.
[46:30.920 --> 46:31.560]  We're done.
[46:33.020 --> 46:34.340]  Double jumping gets you higher.
[46:35.520 --> 46:36.520]  That's oh, cool.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.540]  I've heard that about those.
[46:41.200 --> 46:42.720]  Have you ever tried to double jump in real life?
[46:43.120 --> 46:43.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[46:43.780 --> 46:44.640]  Oh, yeah, all the time, dude.
[46:45.460 --> 46:46.640]  I don't think I've ever tried.
[46:47.500 --> 46:48.280]  You get the hang of it.
[46:48.920 --> 46:51.100]  I don't think I would survive it at this point.
[46:51.320 --> 46:53.440]  I think with my ankles, I would just die.
[46:53.720 --> 46:56.700]  It's probably, uh, extra rough on the ankles.
[46:58.480 --> 46:59.660]  Okay, so we're back.
[47:00.060 --> 47:02.720]  Did you ever see that Fernando Tatis Jr. double jump thing that he did?
[47:03.540 --> 47:04.220]  When he caught that ball?
[47:04.220 --> 47:04.500]  No.
[47:05.140 --> 47:05.900]  What? Really?
[47:06.260 --> 47:07.800]  Didn't he just pull his ACL?
[47:07.980 --> 47:08.740]  Or tear his ACL?
[47:09.040 --> 47:09.740]  Pull ACL tear?
[47:10.360 --> 47:12.100]  No, that was, uh, wasn't that Albies?
[47:12.800 --> 47:13.580]  Oh, that was Acuna.
[47:13.700 --> 47:14.500]  Acuna, I think.
[47:15.220 --> 47:19.420]  There you go, for your records.
[47:21.680 --> 47:27.480]  Insane, insane play where Tatis just goes up in the sky and then goes up in the sky a little bit more.
[47:27.880 --> 47:28.660]  It's fucking crazy.
[47:30.860 --> 47:32.460]  It just makes you go, how do you do that?
[47:33.000 --> 47:33.480]  It's fantastic.
[47:35.940 --> 47:37.280]  Oh, special delivery!
[47:37.280 --> 47:43.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you get the special delivery achievement in Ratatouille 2007.
[47:43.800 --> 47:45.300]  If you were wondering, it's right here.
[47:45.720 --> 47:46.280]  This is what we do.
[47:46.340 --> 47:47.100]  We hunt for achievements.
[47:47.300 --> 47:49.360]  We get them 100% of the time.
[47:49.500 --> 47:50.300]  Oh, no, you broke it.
[47:50.420 --> 47:50.900]  Come on, dude.
[47:50.940 --> 47:51.380]  What are you doing?
[47:51.620 --> 47:52.160]  What are you doing?
[47:52.620 --> 47:53.800]  All the way back.
[47:53.920 --> 47:54.840]  You're heading the game.
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.400]  I'm really nervous that those three coins were in that back room.
[48:04.580 --> 48:04.700]  Yeah.
[48:05.900 --> 48:06.260]  Probably.
[48:06.260 --> 48:07.560]  We have no way to get back there.
[48:07.620 --> 48:08.640]  Why can't we go back there?
[48:09.540 --> 48:12.780]  Because we did a one-time mission that got us there.
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.420]  We opened the door, but it did not register, it seems.
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.100]  So you just do that mission again.
[48:18.900 --> 48:19.740]  I don't think I can.
[48:19.820 --> 48:20.480]  Yeah, I don't know if we can.
[48:20.600 --> 48:22.460]  It was a one-time mission, so we can't 100% the game.
[48:23.340 --> 48:23.880]  All right, we'll see.
[48:24.700 --> 48:25.760]  We'll find out.
[48:25.840 --> 48:29.500]  If that's the case, then we should probably just start over.
[48:30.380 --> 48:32.040]  Oh, is that what we should do?
[48:32.040 --> 48:38.660]  I mean, if you're gonna 100% it, that would be the only way, is just to begin again from scratch.
[48:38.820 --> 48:40.040]  And then not suck up next time.
[48:40.760 --> 48:43.000]  Am I supposed to go with this?
[48:44.520 --> 48:45.400]  Oh, right there.
[48:46.660 --> 48:48.260]  You're gonna get touched by stink bugs.
[48:49.120 --> 48:50.660]  I'm getting away from them. I'm sneaking.
[48:51.040 --> 48:51.600]  You say so.
[48:52.500 --> 48:53.640]  I am. I do.
[48:54.800 --> 48:58.260]  Eric, this is my first time doing a Ratatouille with y'all.
[48:58.260 --> 48:58.900]  Yeah.
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.220]  How far into the... on a percentage-wise basis, how far into the video would you say we are?
[49:06.240 --> 49:07.120]  I'd say about 70.
[49:07.420 --> 49:08.560]  I didn't ask you, I asked Eric.
[49:09.520 --> 49:11.500]  I'm just answering. I'm trying to be helpful. Jesus.
[49:11.980 --> 49:17.280]  I mean, now, while you're wondering, like, how far do you think we are, whatever, it is up to Andrew.
[49:17.540 --> 49:20.700]  Like, I don't, you know, I don't make the call. Andrew definitely makes the call.
[49:21.440 --> 49:22.160]  Oh my god.
[49:22.280 --> 49:23.200]  Can't correct. Can't correct.
[49:23.240 --> 49:24.520]  Kind of why I was asking you.
[49:24.840 --> 49:27.360]  Based on your impressions.
[49:27.360 --> 49:31.740]  Yeah, I would say about three quarters, yes, definitely.
[49:31.940 --> 49:31.980]  Okay.
[49:32.360 --> 49:32.900]  About what Andrew said.
[49:32.900 --> 49:34.980]  You really... Andrew, for real?
[49:37.660 --> 49:38.980]  Oh, okay, okay.
[49:39.120 --> 49:40.020]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[49:40.420 --> 49:41.060]  Hey, thank you.
[49:41.060 --> 49:43.100]  Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
[49:43.140 --> 49:44.580]  Thank you for that. Thank you.
[49:44.880 --> 49:46.220]  Hey, you're that rat pulling the hair.
[49:46.280 --> 49:46.800]  Jesus Christ.
[49:46.800 --> 49:47.560]  We talked about this.
[49:47.980 --> 49:49.260]  It is just like...
[49:49.260 --> 49:50.680]  Yeah, the game's implying a lot.
[49:50.820 --> 49:53.900]  Yeah, I don't really get... I don't really understand subtext.
[49:54.580 --> 49:57.100]  You got, like, hypertext.
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.120]  Supertext that you could give me.
[49:59.180 --> 50:01.000]  There we go. Okay, here we go.
[50:03.620 --> 50:04.440]  That's Brad Garrett.
[50:05.480 --> 50:06.500]  That's Patton Oswalt.
[50:10.220 --> 50:11.380]  Do you kill a dog with this or what?
[50:13.600 --> 50:13.780]  Okay.
[50:17.560 --> 50:18.780]  Is that a magnet?
[50:19.980 --> 50:21.980]  Why? Why do I need a magnet?
[50:25.480 --> 50:26.260]  Hey, you win.
[50:26.880 --> 50:29.200]  Magnet muster mission is now complete, baby.
[50:32.310 --> 50:33.510]  I don't...
[50:33.510 --> 50:35.050]  Dude, you didn't complete all the minigame stages.
[50:36.630 --> 50:38.590]  I... I... I don't...
[50:38.590 --> 50:40.030]  You're 8 of 9 on the minigames.
[50:41.870 --> 50:43.090]  We're 8 of 9?
[50:43.530 --> 50:44.070]  That's what it said.
[50:44.290 --> 50:47.670]  Little Chef Big Kitchen, 97 out of 100 melba toasts.
[50:48.050 --> 50:51.490]  What are we missing?
[50:51.850 --> 50:52.170]  Three.
[50:54.270 --> 50:56.470]  Why would you put me here?
[50:57.290 --> 50:58.190]  I'm gonna go back.
[50:58.450 --> 50:59.930]  Oh, welcome to the hub world, Geoff.
[51:00.030 --> 51:03.970]  This is the hub world in the sewer that you get to all the other levels at.
[51:04.330 --> 51:05.350]  Oh, great.
[51:05.550 --> 51:07.610]  Yeah, it puts you here and you don't want to be here.
[51:07.790 --> 51:09.390]  You just want to go back to what you were doing.
[51:09.910 --> 51:11.070]  That's why the ball is there.
[51:11.930 --> 51:12.850]  Yeah, clearly.
[51:15.310 --> 51:15.990]  Oh my god.
[51:15.990 --> 51:16.450]  Oh, goodness.
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.270]  Oh my god.
[51:20.410 --> 51:21.170]  Oh, goodness.
[51:21.910 --> 51:22.710]  Yeah, man, you showed me.
[51:24.010 --> 51:25.650]  He disconnected his controller.
[51:26.510 --> 51:27.630]  Did he rage quit?
[51:28.490 --> 51:29.130]  No, I'm here.
[51:29.330 --> 51:30.710]  This isn't rage quit.
[51:30.870 --> 51:31.610]  This is Achievement Hunter.
[51:31.770 --> 51:32.250]  This is different.
[51:32.410 --> 51:33.010]  We don't own that, Geoff.
[51:33.050 --> 51:33.670]  We don't have that.
[51:36.950 --> 51:39.090]  Get me on the ball, you piece of shit.
[51:40.470 --> 51:42.290]  Andrew, you're on the ball in more ways than one, buddy.
[51:42.910 --> 51:43.630]  I sure am.
[51:44.150 --> 51:44.630]  Locked in.
[51:44.990 --> 51:45.410]  Oh my god.
[51:45.410 --> 51:46.690]  Get up here, purple toast.
[51:49.990 --> 51:51.050]  This is a totally different level.
[51:51.070 --> 51:52.710]  Wait, was this...
[51:52.710 --> 51:53.410]  Yeah, that's what it said.
[51:54.870 --> 51:56.650]  Higher, springboards, higher.
[51:59.580 --> 52:01.860]  So I'm missing a minigame in this stage?
[52:03.080 --> 52:06.080]  It said that you were at eight of nine, yeah?
[52:06.600 --> 52:08.660]  It's probably where your three pieces are, too, in that minigame.
[52:21.440 --> 52:24.640]  What is Brian Dennehy fucking explaining to you?
[52:24.720 --> 52:25.680]  What is going on?
[52:26.340 --> 52:27.680]  I don't know.
[52:31.330 --> 52:32.630]  Oh, you're opening the door.
[52:34.190 --> 52:36.250]  Oh, please have three coins.
[52:42.000 --> 52:43.860]  Oh my god, please, please, please.
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.700]  Oh, this is this area.
[52:47.800 --> 52:48.520]  We've already been in here.
[52:49.420 --> 52:53.140]  Yeah, maybe the peppers will blow something up that's where their hidden coins are.
[52:53.280 --> 52:55.380]  Like that area of boxes right back there you just went by.
[52:58.400 --> 52:59.740]  We're searching for a minute.
[52:59.740 --> 53:01.180]  Yeah, no, you search for a minute.
[53:01.280 --> 53:03.580]  You got 20 seconds.
[53:05.080 --> 53:05.880]  Moving around.
[53:06.160 --> 53:07.740]  Yeah, yeah, you search for a minute.
[53:07.860 --> 53:08.000]  Yeah.
[53:10.400 --> 53:11.900]  I know they're counting.
[53:12.580 --> 53:13.260]  So am I.
[53:14.280 --> 53:15.380]  Oh, I think I saw something.
[53:15.680 --> 53:16.160]  Oh, yeah, you did.
[53:16.240 --> 53:16.900]  You big time did.
[53:17.180 --> 53:17.860]  Let's go get it.
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.360]  No, I guess I did.
[53:22.720 --> 53:24.040]  Oh, yeah, you did.
[53:24.140 --> 53:24.700]  I can climb.
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.860]  You've already been up here.
[53:28.340 --> 53:29.180]  We already did this.
[53:29.180 --> 53:30.920]  We're being thorough.
[53:34.450 --> 53:34.930]  Anyway.
[53:35.370 --> 53:36.450]  Anyway, let's see.
[53:37.210 --> 53:38.550]  Oh, here's a novel idea.
[53:40.010 --> 53:40.870]  Oh, my God.
[53:41.190 --> 53:42.330]  Are you going to crack the code on this one?
[53:43.530 --> 53:44.670]  I think I figured it out.
[53:45.550 --> 53:46.790]  What do you got going on back there?
[53:47.670 --> 53:49.350]  I don't think we've been back here.
[53:49.790 --> 53:50.050]  No?
[53:51.030 --> 53:51.910]  I don't think so.
[53:56.900 --> 53:58.700]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[53:59.420 --> 54:00.960]  You probably got to grab on them sausages.
[54:01.860 --> 54:02.820]  Pretty good.
[54:02.820 --> 54:03.840]  Hang on, he's exploring.
[54:05.060 --> 54:06.580]  I'm looking for coins, man.
[54:07.460 --> 54:07.820]  Coin!
[54:09.040 --> 54:10.560]  That wasn't the right kind of coin.
[54:10.880 --> 54:11.840]  Okay, no, not the right kind.
[54:11.840 --> 54:13.420]  You do have to go collect those, I think, though.
[54:15.760 --> 54:17.000]  I think I've done this before.
[54:18.400 --> 54:19.040]  Oh, shit.
[54:21.440 --> 54:23.160]  He really didn't like that that ball fell off.
[54:24.160 --> 54:24.880]  Oh, boy.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.760]  Is that your mini game over there you haven't done yet, maybe?
[54:30.880 --> 54:31.240]  Or...
[54:32.020 --> 54:33.720]  We're just plugging up the freezer.
[54:33.900 --> 54:35.280]  What happened?
[54:37.060 --> 54:37.660]  Uh...
[54:37.660 --> 54:38.480]  Bounce!
[54:38.720 --> 54:39.280]  Timer!
[54:40.120 --> 54:41.220]  What's that guy for?
[54:43.160 --> 54:43.820]  There you go.
[54:44.960 --> 54:45.360]  But what?
[54:46.180 --> 54:47.080]  To what end?
[54:48.300 --> 54:49.220]  To what end?
[54:50.460 --> 54:52.120]  What am I doing with you?
[54:53.700 --> 54:54.800]  Can you jump on it?
[54:56.700 --> 54:57.820]  I bet that's it.
[54:58.960 --> 55:00.200]  Can you tail whip it from there?
[55:00.940 --> 55:01.380]  No.
[55:01.540 --> 55:02.520]  From on top of it?
[55:02.980 --> 55:03.420]  No!
[55:10.920 --> 55:12.180]  There's no way!
[55:15.200 --> 55:17.100]  Did you like doing all that stuff?
[55:17.200 --> 55:18.140]  Check it out again, baby.
[55:20.380 --> 55:21.820]  I'm going a different way this time.
[55:25.390 --> 55:26.510]  Oh, what about this?
[55:29.010 --> 55:29.790]  What about it?
[55:29.790 --> 55:32.890]  Is there like a thing to land?
[55:34.490 --> 55:35.290]  No? Okay.
[55:38.010 --> 55:38.350]  Okay.
[55:39.890 --> 55:42.470]  I thought maybe that'd be where the coins were.
[55:46.480 --> 55:47.160]  What?
[55:48.700 --> 55:50.060]  I don't know.
[55:50.400 --> 55:51.560]  What's happening?
[55:52.260 --> 55:53.660]  I don't know.
[55:54.760 --> 55:55.800]  Why am I...
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.500]  What?
[55:58.480 --> 56:00.700]  This can't be where I'm supposed to be.
[56:00.700 --> 56:01.940]  Why not? There's a balloon...
[56:01.940 --> 56:06.060]  What is that? A banana? No? Popsicle?
[56:10.060 --> 56:12.420]  Brad Garrett's just fucking chewing the scenery.
[56:16.600 --> 56:17.480]  I'm stuck.
[56:18.680 --> 56:20.600]  Oh, okay. Oh, you just had to double jump.
[56:21.820 --> 56:22.380]  I was.
[56:22.960 --> 56:24.260]  Yeah, that's something you can do.
[56:25.600 --> 56:28.060]  Why don't you bust those boxes out and then go through that?
[56:28.920 --> 56:30.060]  Yeah, let's find a pepper.
[56:32.060 --> 56:32.940]  Let's do that.
[56:34.200 --> 56:34.520]  Okay.
[56:35.620 --> 56:36.340]  Where's the pepper?
[56:37.560 --> 56:38.880]  Here we go. Right there in front of you.
[56:38.980 --> 56:39.960]  Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[56:42.780 --> 56:43.560]  Bring it back.
[56:45.300 --> 56:45.960]  This is awesome.
[56:46.400 --> 56:48.720]  I... this can't be what we're supposed to be doing.
[56:48.780 --> 56:50.760]  Why not? What else are we supposed to be doing?
[56:51.420 --> 56:54.620]  I don't know, but this is completely different than what we were doing before.
[56:55.160 --> 56:56.280]  Well, you went a completely different way.
[56:57.400 --> 56:58.460]  Yeah, but I don't...
[57:00.180 --> 57:01.600]  What is going on?
[57:02.220 --> 57:03.320]  Are you gonna go down that?
[57:03.320 --> 57:03.840]  What is in here?
[57:04.280 --> 57:05.560]  Wait, is this just an alternate?
[57:05.620 --> 57:07.920]  This game is fucking crazy.
[57:08.840 --> 57:10.240]  This game is insane.
[57:10.420 --> 57:11.120]  It's a game of options.
[57:12.020 --> 57:12.300]  Go ahead.
[57:13.240 --> 57:14.340]  Oh my god.
[57:16.500 --> 57:16.920]  Okay.
[57:17.060 --> 57:19.460]  Look at what's going on up there. You got some clams fucking clamming.
[57:19.940 --> 57:22.020]  I didn't break that last time, didn't I?
[57:22.100 --> 57:22.320]  No.
[57:22.580 --> 57:23.900]  This was not like this.
[57:24.160 --> 57:24.400]  No.
[57:26.160 --> 57:27.520]  Ooh, you're gonna need another one.
[57:31.740 --> 57:33.260]  Where... where did the peppers go?
[57:33.840 --> 57:34.380]  There you go.
[57:35.620 --> 57:36.400]  Right in front of you.
[57:36.480 --> 57:37.000]  Took a while.
[57:37.620 --> 57:40.380]  Well, I had to respawn and I'm shocked how long it took.
[57:42.120 --> 57:43.100]  It's way too long.
[57:43.400 --> 57:44.100]  Okay, here we go.
[57:45.500 --> 57:47.720]  Does he always get this grumpy by the end of the video?
[57:48.320 --> 57:50.440]  Yeah, I mean, you know, it depends.
[57:50.560 --> 57:51.320]  He wants the cake.
[57:51.700 --> 57:53.040]  It's... he doesn't know what's going on.
[57:53.100 --> 57:53.820]  He keeps exploring.
[57:55.400 --> 57:55.780]  There it is.
[57:55.800 --> 57:56.220]  Body by Jake.
[57:56.220 --> 57:57.160]  What is happening?
[58:00.080 --> 58:02.360]  Wait, is Body by Jake in the box?
[58:02.940 --> 58:03.560]  Yeah, he's in the cake box.
[58:03.560 --> 58:04.280]  Is he locking himself in?
[58:06.000 --> 58:06.740]  Cake box.
[58:09.340 --> 58:11.180]  There's seven minutes, dude.
[58:11.460 --> 58:11.880]  Relax.
[58:12.640 --> 58:13.240]  We have so much time.
[58:13.240 --> 58:14.380]  What? You don't even know what you're supposed to do.
[58:14.420 --> 58:16.120]  You're talking about it like that's plenty of time.
[58:16.860 --> 58:18.380]  What? It's clearly plenty of time.
[58:18.500 --> 58:20.120]  Nothing in this game takes seven minutes.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.760]  All right, I just want somebody to remember this part and then whatever happens next.
[58:25.120 --> 58:25.420]  Yeah.
[58:25.420 --> 58:28.240]  All right, you double jumping.
[58:30.260 --> 58:31.700]  He cracked the code.
[58:32.280 --> 58:33.200]  Oh, you can go.
[58:33.280 --> 58:34.300]  I'm just going through here.
[58:34.520 --> 58:37.440]  I just want to go to the other side.
[58:37.640 --> 58:38.120]  Oh, there you go.
[58:38.120 --> 58:38.700]  You get on top.
[58:40.900 --> 58:42.860]  I think I'm supposed to get over there.
[58:43.960 --> 58:44.780]  Maybe you're...
[58:44.780 --> 58:45.500]  Let's go back.
[58:46.260 --> 58:46.860]  There you go.
[58:47.980 --> 58:48.780]  I bet you remember.
[58:49.060 --> 58:50.060]  Remember when the one...
[58:50.060 --> 58:54.180]  Remember when the one rat through the ball or whatever at the light?
[58:54.920 --> 58:55.880]  That was crazy.
[58:56.140 --> 58:57.320]  Yeah, I don't know why he did that.
[58:57.380 --> 58:58.680]  That's like some Metal Gear Solid shit.
[58:58.800 --> 58:59.360]  That was tactical.
[58:59.740 --> 59:02.240]  I'm not really sure why he did that, but boy, he did it, you know?
[59:03.780 --> 59:04.500]  There's a...
[59:05.020 --> 59:06.560]  I don't think I'm missing...
[59:06.560 --> 59:08.560]  There's a light switch over there you can turn on.
[59:09.040 --> 59:10.400]  You pull it and turn it down.
[59:11.240 --> 59:12.220]  Yeah, I'm gonna get the cake.
[59:12.880 --> 59:13.160]  Relax.
[59:14.800 --> 59:16.160]  He's telling Brad Garrett to relax.
[59:16.920 --> 59:17.500]  I am.
[59:17.700 --> 59:20.400]  Maybe if you pull that, it'll let them know the cake is ready.
[59:21.500 --> 59:22.420]  Yeah, I think so.
[59:23.800 --> 59:24.760]  Let's, uh...
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.660]  Let's have the guy break the thing again.
[59:28.820 --> 59:29.300]  Sausage.
[59:29.380 --> 59:30.200]  I'm the sausages.
[59:32.060 --> 59:33.460]  I wanted a sausage.
[59:35.400 --> 59:36.220]  That's for you, Eric.
[59:38.800 --> 59:40.660]  Is that a body by Jake Quote?
[59:41.680 --> 59:44.040]  No, that's Richard Simmons on the Howard Stern Show.
[59:47.340 --> 59:47.820]  Okay.
[59:47.820 --> 59:48.080]  Okay.
[59:50.620 --> 59:52.500]  Maybe now you can turn the dial.
[59:53.640 --> 59:54.040]  Maybe.
[59:54.360 --> 59:55.360]  Because you've done the other thing first.
[59:55.360 --> 59:56.740]  If so, that's insane.
[59:57.000 --> 59:57.540]  I don't think so.
[59:57.660 --> 59:58.140]  Probably not.
[59:58.260 --> 59:58.820]  Check the air conditioner.
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.060]  Fun thing to do, though.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.260]  Yeah.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.780]  I think you gotta go down and open that door.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.080]  Yeah, I think you do too.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.380]  Oh my god.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.940]  Maybe you bounce on that thing.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.960]  Wait, go across.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.960]  Go where those boxes are.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.060]  Okay, well, never mind.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.060]  You got it.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.440]  Go where?
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.620]  Nah, you're fine.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.460]  Andrew, time has passed.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:18.820]  You're fine.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.620]  Where am I going?
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.440]  You got it, dude.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.240]  Five minutes.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:22.700]  Plenty of time.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.340]  No, you gotta Rebby me.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.240]  No, no, no.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.000]  Five minutes.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.780]  Plenty of time.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:26.940]  Okay.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.000]  I'm gonna go to where that coin is.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:30.600]  Okay.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.080]  Hanging on like Hans Gruber.
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.620]  Three, two...
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.480]  Okay.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.160]  The coin is like over here.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.660]  I mean, it has to mean something.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:56.640]  That little symbol.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.260]  Does it?
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:00:59.600]  I think so.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.280]  The magnet's there.
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720]  You probably open the door.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.120]  Yeah, I'm working on it.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.180]  Four minutes.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.720]  Geoff, four minutes.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.460]  Plenty of time.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.180]  Plenty of time.
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340]  More than four minutes, honestly.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:17.320]  How do I get up there again?
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.620]  Climb over here.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.520]  I just need to get on the top again.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:24.020]  Right.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:24.860]  Yeah.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.520]  That's all you need to do.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:29.220]  That's all I need to do.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:29.680]  That's it.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.180]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.660]  What a noise.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.380]  The timer's starting to feel like it's a little short.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.160]  Why is that?
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.500]  It's kind of like...
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.040]  Ten minutes forever.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.380]  It's not what I heard.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:45.980]  There's plenty of time, baby.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.240]  Yeah, but 340.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.420]  I wish you could get up there, though.
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.000]  Oh, up there.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:52.940]  Yeah, right there.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:53.920]  That's what I got to get.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.300]  How do I get there?
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:01:59.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.040]  There's like a straw.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.080]  Oh, yeah, you gotta do that.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:03.660]  And go back.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.280]  There you go.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.600]  That one.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.420]  We're just running.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:15.900]  We're just running.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.420]  That leads to that.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.420]  And it's dropped down.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.040]  Yeah.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.280]  Oh, three minutes.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:23.680]  OK.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.780]  There's something up here I could get.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.900]  Why are you breaking?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.340]  Why are you breaking?
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.460]  See this son of a bitch, Geoff?
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.640]  Look at this fucking guy.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.700]  Jump on his head and walk him to the other side.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.620]  Hey, what happens when you die in this part?
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]  Is that where you want to be?
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:02.880]  Fuck off.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.440]  You understand why when you asked earlier about like,
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.780]  how much how much time do you think there is left?
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.500]  I said that I don't control that.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.260]  It's not me.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:13.560]  It's all Andrew.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.700]  Isn't that what you wanted, though?
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.280]  You got that.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:16.860]  Now we're good.
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:17.560]  Right.
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.300]  He's going a different way this time.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.360]  He's using the magnet.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.340]  I'm going the first way.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.440]  Going the first way.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:24.920]  OK.
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.720]  Now I gotta get back up there.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.120]  Right.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.080]  And do it the other way.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:28.540]  Uh-huh.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:31.980]  Yeah, I do.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:32.780]  God damn it.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.840]  God damn it.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.680]  Fuck off, Geoff.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.900]  Hey, what did I do?
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.480]  Geoff, that was...
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.100]  Geoff, there's over...
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.020]  Geoff, there's over nine minutes left.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.020]  There's plenty of time.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.080]  God damn it.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.620]  God damn.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.600]  Fuck off.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.300]  I know, that's what I'm saying.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880]  I hate you.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.860]  I'm trying to get up there.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.220]  I'm just encouraging you.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.560]  I'm just like...
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.000]  You're mimicking me in the worst way.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.340]  Oh, I'm in your corner.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.200]  I'm like Burgess Meredith and Rocky.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:10.620]  OK.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:13.900]  Let's climb up.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.400]  Ah!
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:15.320]  Nailed it.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.140]  What a badass.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:16.640]  Here we go.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.460]  There we go.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.140]  I hate that it was so easy to get up there.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.020]  It's all I needed to do is just go over there.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.020]  I'm not even gonna walk on this.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.280]  Just do a normal thing.
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:27.100]  Look at you.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.180]  Now you get that.
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:29.860]  OK.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.000]  OK, Bella's down.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.400]  I think we've done it.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:37.660]  OK.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.860]  I don't know why we needed to do that, but we needed to do that.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.780]  All in here again.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.320]  Yeah.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.680]  We just don't die.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.220]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:46.780]  I'm not going to.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:47.760]  This is it.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.720]  Exploded, dude.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:49.720]  All right.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.540]  Eight minutes.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:51.900]  Eight minutes, 15 seconds.
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.080]  You got so much time.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  So much fucking time.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.240]  He's gonna... I'm gonna blow this up and then he gets into the cake.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.500]  Well, you have to blow this up.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.760]  You have to wait for it to respawn.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.920]  And then you have to...
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.420]  You'll have to...
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.080]  You need to have a small meltdown before it respawns.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:06.620]  Between...
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:06.760]  All right.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:07.020]  Now...
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:07.440]  OK.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.080]  Now we gotta wait for this one to respawn.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.080]  It goes right here.
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.340]  I'm not getting fooled again.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:14.740]  I know.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.160]  I see what you're doing, Pepper.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.540]  I see you.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.560]  I'm on to you, Pepper.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.780]  I figured you out.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.880]  And hit that.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:28.880]  Textbook.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.680]  I don't need any more peppers.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:31.500]  Who does?
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.900]  And then he goes, I'm gonna put this cake in a box.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.500]  Body by Jake.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.260]  He put my Jake in a box.
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:41.980]  And then...
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:42.660]  Thank you.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.300]  Uh, go up.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:47.620]  Right?
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:48.540]  Oh, fuck.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.740]  Maybe you use a pepper to blow him up inside the cake.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.940]  Why are you doing this?
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.320]  Because I gotta get up to the guy that throws the thing at the light.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:05:59.060]  No!
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.440]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.800]  Well, you're fucked.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:02.760]  You only have seven minutes.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.620]  I went up and over.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.020]  Geoff, seven minutes?
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.940]  That's plenty of time.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:06.440]  No.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.680]  That's plenty of time.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.020]  It's easy.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.680]  I don't know why I'm hitting all of these.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.860]  I just really only need to do this one, but whatever.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.920]  Oh, you're so close to grabbing on the sausage.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.320]  I mean, okay.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.040]  All right, now you do this part.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.540]  Watch out for the stink bugs.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.800]  Don't fall over the side.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.520]  Don't fall off.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.140]  There you go.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:40.700]  Now he throws the thing, and now I probably get to hit the timer.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.420]  Yeah, there we go.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.280]  We're gonna do this.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.920]  It's like they got these coins that are telling you where to go.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:49.640]  Crazy.
[01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.470]  Oh, now we just...
[01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.750]  Okay.
[01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:55.090]  Okay.
[01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:03.250]  It's a short man.
[01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.870]  Maybe that tray, the cart will lead to the bonus coins.
[01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:14.870]  Why did we steal the cake?
[01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.410]  The rats like eating cake.
[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:18.630]  Why wouldn't you steal the cake?
[01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:19.090]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:20.430]  So it's just pure thievery.
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:22.570]  There's no altruistic motive or anything.
[01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:22.910]  Okay.
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.890]  Yeah.
[01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:24.250]  I'm fine.
[01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:24.650]  Uh-oh.
[01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.050]  I think you might be getting chased around right now, Andrew.
[01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.830]  Oh, no!
[01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:28.570]  Run, run, run!
[01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:31.910]  This is sort of like the way they cap off these levels, Geoff.
[01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.850]  That's exciting.
[01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:35.430]  Hopefully, they cap it off with three more stars.
[01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:37.390]  Well, just don't worry.
[01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.710]  It's fine.
[01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:40.130]  You just got to do this three times, and it's fine.
[01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:43.570]  Oh, these take forever.
[01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:46.890]  Oh, boy.
[01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:47.850]  There's lots of them.
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:48.770]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:52.690]  Don't let...
[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:55.210]  You just have to be careful about Skinner and...
[01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:55.430]  Oh!
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:58.970]  ...the chef that looks like it has your head from when you were a child.
[01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:07.430]  It's crazy that the clams are working for the chefs against you.
[01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:08.790]  It seems like you guys would be on the same team.
[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.570]  You wouldn't think they would be, but they are.
[01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.590]  He's running through, like, broken glass and shit.
[01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:14.790]  Oh, my God!
[01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:15.230]  Damn.
[01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.510]  He paled that crate.
[01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:19.350]  Cooking right now.
[01:08:19.570 --> 01:08:20.550]  Run, Remy, run!
[01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:21.510]  Why are they...
[01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:22.390]  Oh, my God!
[01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.610]  Why don't you grab three coins while you're doing it?
[01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:26.290]  Look out!
[01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:27.650]  Why are we back here?
[01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:28.370]  His giant head!
[01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:29.850]  Oof.
[01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:30.970]  Catching up.
[01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:34.910]  I mean, this isn't a big level.
[01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.370]  I don't...
[01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:39.690]  I mean, we've looped it now twice.
[01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.290]  Ah, you fucking fell.
[01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:44.390]  Yeah, but like everything else, you've got to do it three times.
[01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:44.910]  Oh, there you go.
[01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:45.460]  Uh-oh.
[01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:47.570]  Eat, Andrew.
[01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:49.710]  One more time, baby.
[01:08:51.330 --> 01:08:51.750]  Lemons!
[01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:53.970]  I can send them flying.
[01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:55.630]  At least there's checkpoints.
[01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:56.310]  Make lemonade.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.080]  You ran into the wall.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.070]  I don't...
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.980]  Okay, you've got to do better.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:08.880]  Avoid the walls.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.040]  You've got...
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.100]  Andrew.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.040]  Straight into the lemons.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.160]  You've got to do better.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.820]  I've got to avoid him.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.100]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.060]  Jump over the flower.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.880]  The regular...
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.200]  Oof.
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.740]  That's ridiculous!
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:26.600]  That is insane!
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.000]  I said that so far.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.900]  That was a 60-yard field goal, that lemon.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:30.900]  That was awesome.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.700]  Channel your inner Indiana Jones.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:34.640]  Jump!
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.180]  I'm jumping!
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:36.880]  Now, don't...
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.740]  This is where you usually die, so don't do it.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.200]  Yeah, going up, going up.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:42.680]  Jump on that thing.
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.080]  It's bouncy.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:44.200]  Yep.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.980]  You didn't bounce high enough, dude.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:47.740]  You've got to double jump.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.740]  Geoff, you want to tell them about the double jump?
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.660]  I did double...
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:51.340]  Oh, my God.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.380]  You can double jump to get higher.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.780]  I don't...
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.560]  Thanks, Geoff.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:57.980]  Yeah.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.420]  We have to do another one of these with Nick in 15 minutes.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.580]  Oh, my God!
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.240]  That's a problem, too, because Nick's a real prick.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.540]  No, he'll be helpful.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.280]  He won't be...
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.420]  Ah, I'm excited for Nick.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:13.860]  Yeah, no.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:16.560]  You'll have a very different video than one with Nick, I'm sure.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:16.760]  Yep.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.500]  Okay, here we go.
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:17.960]  There you go.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:18.460]  All right.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.160]  Now, up here, about right here, you're going to die.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:22.860]  Yeah, go wide.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:23.560]  Go wide.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.120]  There you go.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:24.360]  There you go.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.500]  Don't forget to bounce on that.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.220]  Bounce on that guy.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:26.460]  Bounce on him.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:26.920]  There you go.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:27.460]  All the way.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.520]  There you go.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.200]  Big jumps.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:29.620]  Here we go.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.040]  Big jumps.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:30.480]  Here we go.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.080]  Big jumps.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:31.700]  Here we go.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.160]  Easy, baby.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:33.700]  Jump!
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.560]  You went the wrong way.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.540]  How is that not the one?
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:36.240]  You went the wrong way.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.740]  You have to keep going straight.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.420]  You want to keep running at the camera and jump.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.420]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.740]  Yeah, you can double jump if you're not quite sure if you're going to make it.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.880]  That was your best...
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:46.260]  Double jump to go higher.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.080]  That was your best lemon kick yet.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.160]  Oh, then this might be the run.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:51.760]  Never mind.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.400]  Okay, lock in.
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.180]  Lock in.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.440]  You got to lock in.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.200]  Lock in.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.160]  This one right here, this one's for the boys.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:04.580]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:05.700]  Is it?
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.240]  I hope so.
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.400]  The boys want to eat lunch, so...
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.600]  What are the boys having for lunch?
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:16.940]  I don't know.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.940]  The boys haven't been downstairs.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.340]  They'll figure it out.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.840]  Lemon kick is getting progressively less cool.
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:28.580]  Oh, man.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:30.460]  Okay.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:31.900]  Boys are hungry.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.780]  Oh, well.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.520]  I can't.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.160]  I can't get through that.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.500]  You can do it.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.360]  Nothing better.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.640]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.340]  No, we got to watch 1-800-MAGIC still.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.560]  You think this is the end, Geoff?
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.300]  There's bonus content.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.640]  You have to watch 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.200]  This is not over, you fool.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.180]  Oh, my God.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.380]  I'm pretty sure it's over for the rat.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.300]  Yeah, it might be curtains for this guy.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:08.940]  Double jump.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:09.380]  There you go.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:09.800]  Del Stale.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.740]  Oh, you idiot.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:11.500]  You're a great chef.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.220]  Sure is an idiot.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.160]  I swear to God.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.360]  The game wants you to jump.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:14.960]  Ah!
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.720]  Why is this so hard?
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.320]  Who is watching this?
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:23.340]  Who is watching this?
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.080]  Why is this so hard?
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.020]  Just fast forward to the part where he's done.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.820]  Why is this so hard?
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.840]  I can never figure out in these.
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.500]  Why is this so hard?
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.160]  Like, who's more miserable right now?
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.660]  Us or Andrew?
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.140]  I genuinely don't know.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:42.800]  I don't know.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:43.800]  I don't know.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.500]  It's got to be neck and neck.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.900]  No, it's me by a lot.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.640]  No, because you have the power to end this.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:52.780]  We have power.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.400]  That's what makes it more miserable.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.260]  Just choose to do it real quick.
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.660]  Yeah, I'm doing it.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.060]  I'm doing it.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.780]  Better than you've been.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.460]  Don't forget about the...
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:01.940]  There you go.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:02.860]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:03.500]  You're doing great.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.380]  There's going to be one over here.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:04.940]  A big one.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:05.740]  Then that one's big.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.460]  There you go.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:06.940]  There you go.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.080]  Jump.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.500]  Why would you try to...
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.360]  Oh my God.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.360]  There have been no corners to turn.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.520]  You've been running straight.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.740]  Just run straight.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.820]  Just run straight.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.700]  He's just standing there.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.100]  Great chef sure is an idiot.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.420]  Completing mini games will give you a neat reward.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:25.780]  Will it?
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.670]  I'm like...
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.340]  Okay, just run to the camera.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:30.680]  Just run at the camera.
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.200]  Run at the camera.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.260]  Don't hit the tomatoes.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.180]  Great.
[01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:42.450]  Why is run at the camera making you better at this?
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:43.670]  Run at the camera.
[01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:45.490]  Don't...
[01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.950]  Why is it making you better at this?
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.070]  I don't understand.
[01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.370]  I don't...
[01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:52.110]  Just run at the camera.
[01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:56.210]  That's all this is.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.140]  Run at the camera.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:01.580]  He gets like...
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:01.980]  Run at the camera.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.160]  He's getting there one foot at a time.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.420]  Run at the camera seems to be working for you though.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:11.300]  Hey, you know what?
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.160]  Run at the camera.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.220]  Definitely helping you get through the tomatoes in that first dog.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.240]  He's got to run at that camera.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:23.700]  Keep chasing the camera.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.160]  No!
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.380]  Right in the soup.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:27.980]  This is a kid's game.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:29.460]  Yeah.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.020]  Little kids are doing this right now.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:32.700]  Little babies.
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:34.800]  I don't think any kid has ever done this.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.240]  Little toddlers are playing this.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.140]  I beat Elden Ring.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.820]  So you're saying this is harder than Elden Ring?
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:42.980]  I...
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.440]  It's up there.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.340]  This is in the top 10 of boss fights in Elden Ring.
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.580]  Hang on, I'm looking it up.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.360]  Oh, Ratatouille 2007 published by From Software?
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.380]  What the fuck?
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:54.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.080]  This is where it all began.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.400]  Just run at the camera.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.040]  Don't jump over... there you go.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.640]  You said there I go and it still killed me.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.420]  Yeah, yeah, there you go.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.260]  Don't jump over them to get in the water.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.520]  You have to get on them.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.160]  There you go.
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.060]  Don't say I know.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.860]  There were so many places on the map there that were sponge.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.660]  And you just need to be on those places.
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:21.260]  Yep.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.340]  But the camera...
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.240]  You went on the other places.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.100]  What about the camera?
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.460]  Run at the camera, that's it.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:26.600]  I gotta run at it.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.220]  Okay, okay.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.720]  Now it's the double stew and now a plate and then table and then we got sponge.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:41.940]  And then...
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.240]  Run at the camera, run at the camera, run at the camera, run at the camera.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.860]  Just keep running at the camera.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.620]  Do it again, do it again.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:49.620]  That has to be a checkpoint.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.240]  There's no way that's not a checkpoint.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:53.820]  Oh boy.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.380]  No, just run at the camera.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.080]  Just run at the camera.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.260]  Holy shit.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.240]  Full on run.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.620]  How long does this go?
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.440]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:09.960]  Is that crazy?
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.360]  What the... what was that?
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.280]  Where did the turkey come from?
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.320]  Artisan bread.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:18.840]  Oh.
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.660]  You're almost there.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:26.700]  I mean...
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.820]  Yes!
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:29.240]  Yeah!
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.580]  Made it by a whisker.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:37.320]  Hey!
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.180]  Collected a health container.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.080]  What about my three coins?
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.320]  What about the three coins?
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.220]  Bonus materials.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.080]  What about them?
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.620]  Yeah, that's where you get the bonus materials.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:51.960]  Let's...
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.860]  Well, we got to do bonus material.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.620]  Yeah, we got to look at the bonus.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.820]  What about your three coins?
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:58.520]  Oh, we'll go back and get them.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.260]  We'll go back and get them next time.
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.820]  We'll get those with Nick.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:02.920]  I wouldn't worry about that.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:03.500]  Oh, great.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.820]  I don't even get to see it.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.720]  No, fuck no, you don't.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.540]  All right.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.800]  But you know what you do get to see?
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.200]  The bonus content?
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.260]  Bonus content!
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.500]  Yeah, Andrew's favorite.
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.440]  I don't remember which one we left off on.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:19.680]  No idea.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.720]  Geoff, don't you love Ratatouille?
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:25.140]  2007?
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:27.600]  Man, I remember liking the movie.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:32.720]  Well, if you like the movie, Geoff, you can text RATS to 84746.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.000]  What happens when you do that?
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.120]  Nothing. It does not text you back. You don't get anything.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.640]  You get a ringtone.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:42.260]  Right?
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.460]  A little salt, a little...
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:45.420]  You want to watch some WALL-E teaser?
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.320]  What about Mobile.THQ.com?
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.700]  No, no, no, no, we already saw this.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.660]  No, we're not watching the shit that we haven't watched.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:50.600]  Like, what are you doing?
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:52.940]  Mobile.THQ.com.
[01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.480]  Which one were we last on?
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:54.260]  Keep going.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.380]  Keep going. We already saw those.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.240]  Oh, we might be...
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.880]  Oh! We have not looked at these.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.160]  I think bonus...
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:03.700]  No, we've seen those.
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.160]  No, we have. We have. We have seen those.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.380]  That was the last one we've seen.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.300]  Yep, yep.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.360]  Now we're on 11.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.140]  All right, here we go. 11.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.180]  All right, bonus content, Geoff.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.880]  This is the Pixar concept art character lineup.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.720]  And you can tell which characters are which just based by their outlines,
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:19.040]  which is a fun thing that...
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.620]  I think, um, animation.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.360]  Wow, some drama-looking motherfucker on the right.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.020]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:28.920]  Oh, it's Buddy by Jake!
[01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.630]  What?
[01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.290]  These are my...
[01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:38.030]  This, this...
[01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.870]  Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:41.210]  Okay, I'm the one that's all the way...
[01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:43.090]  I'm the one that's all the way on the left, I think.
[01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:45.330]  I think you're all the way on the right.
[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:47.130]  These seem like digital maquettes.
[01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.610]  Like, why make a digital maquette?
[01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:52.550]  I can't believe you think I'm the one on the right.
[01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:53.490]  I think Andrew...
[01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:54.630]  Okay, Gavin is the one...
[01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:57.110]  If I'm all the way on the right, the one next to me is Gavin.
[01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.830]  Yeah.
[01:18:57.830 --> 01:19:01.390]  And then I would say, Andrew, you're the one in the middle.
[01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.270]  Geoff, you're the one with the big eyebrows.
[01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:06.130]  And then Nick is all the way on the left.
[01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:10.230]  I think going right to left, it's me, Gavin, Andrew, Geoff, Nick.
[01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.830]  I agree. I agree. I'm comfortable with that.
[01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:15.390]  Andrew, how do you feel about that?
[01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:17.870]  I don't mind. I'm okay with that.
[01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:21.970]  I figured I'd either be the middle one or the one to his left or his right, I guess.
[01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.570]  But yeah, that's the Rat Heist lineup.
[01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:26.180]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:27.950]  Ranting it out.
[01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:29.550]  Skinner.
[01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:30.650]  There he is.
[01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:31.410]  Looking pissed.
[01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:32.390]  Skinner!
[01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:33.930]  Slipping on lemons.
[01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.850]  Okay, now let's go to the main part of the show.
[01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.530]  The finale.
[01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:38.130]  Yep.
[01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:41.550]  The last part of 1-800-MAGIC.
[01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:43.010]  Geoff, are you excited?
[01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:44.510]  Kind of.
[01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:48.550]  What do you remember? What can you tell us about 1-800-MAGIC?
[01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:51.790]  I remember that we made it. I remember that it was in Shadowrun.
[01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:54.730]  I remember that I believe Joel directed it.
[01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:57.270]  I can't remember if he wrote it as well.
[01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.910]  I believe he did.
[01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:03.590]  I do not remember if I was in it or if I helped make it, but I do remember that it existed.
[01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:10.270]  And I'm hoping watching an episode will jog some sort of a memory of its creation.
[01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:13.390]  It'll jog something.
[01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:15.330]  Is it very funny?
[01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:16.470]  Is it good?
[01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:18.610]  Does it stand up?
[01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.710]  Well, we're excited to watch it with you, I guess is what we'll do.
[01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:21.530]  Oh boy.
[01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.490]  Yeah.
[01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.030]  My game videos.
[01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:31.790]  I don't think it's in...
[01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.550]  Oh, there we go.
[01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:37.010]  He's got a lot of stuff downloaded here. It's a lot.
[01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:40.690]  One, two, four.
[01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:41.470]  Are you ready?
[01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:42.930]  Yep. All right, Geoff, you ready?
[01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:44.490]  The finale.
[01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.930]  Remember that.
[01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:50.830]  I remember that loading.
[01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.270]  Remember that.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.580]  Any memories?
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.240]  Not so far.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.040]  I can fix it. I can fix it.
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.380]  Think about the amount of stuff that you made.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:05.880]  That's Joel.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.500]  Just don't even remember.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.260]  No, I have no clue.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.540]  There's probably like an 80% chance I'm machinimating one of these characters.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:16.800]  Oh, definitely.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.180]  That's Nathan.
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.380]  You remember that?
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.320]  Is that me?
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.060]  I think so.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:35.640]  Is that me and Gus?
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.640]  You think he needs help?
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:40.700]  What, you mean the blue guy?
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:41.860]  No, he's doing fine.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.500]  No, that's Jason. That's me and Jason.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.820]  You remember this?
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.720]  I kind of do.
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.220]  I kind of do remember head bobbing that a little bit.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.200]  Really?
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.000]  Yeah.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.040]  He's using crazy talk for all the voices, for the mouths.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.580]  I'm not too bad, actually.
[01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:16.570]  Does this bring anything back now?
[01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:17.910]  You're going like, oh, I remember this part.
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:19.010]  Here's what comes next.
[01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.970]  No clue.
[01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.790]  No clue.
[01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.630]  Do you think it's because you didn't watch parts one through three?
[01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:24.270]  I think it might.
[01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:24.770]  I don't remember.
[01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:26.070]  I don't know what any of this is about.
[01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.750]  It's okay.
[01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:28.870]  We watched all these and neither do we.
[01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:29.650]  There's a magic tree.
[01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:36.230]  What?
[01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.870]  What?
[01:22:42.330 --> 01:22:44.790]  I think you need to just go back to the other side.
[01:22:45.130 --> 01:22:45.610]  That's Gus.
[01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:47.930]  I thought so, too.
[01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.210]  Cool.
[01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.950]  That's definitely Gus.
[01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:54.310]  I was magical and I was the one and I was on the wrong side.
[01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:55.830]  Yeah, that's okay, man.
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:59.350]  I really think you should just go back to the other side.
[01:22:59.410 --> 01:22:59.670]  Who's that?
[01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:00.590]  I told him he was the one.
[01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:01.830]  Listen, it's complicated.
[01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.930]  But you told me I was the one.
[01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:04.570]  I think that's Joel.
[01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.150]  You said I was special.
[01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:07.070]  We can talk about this later.
[01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:10.350]  Look, I mean, you should really just go back to the other side.
[01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:11.630]  Yeah, it might be Joel again.
[01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:26.390]  I'm sure we'll get credits.
[01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:27.250]  I don't know, man.
[01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:28.210]  It's so hard to remember.
[01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:31.650]  This must have been... what year did this come out?
[01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:34.470]  Two thousand nineteen hundred and forty three?
[01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:36.450]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:42.670]  I remember it was during the Korean conflict.
[01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:43.650]  Let's see.
[01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:46.130]  That's the end.
[01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:47.650]  Oh no, is that the beginning?
[01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.890]  That can't be the beginning.
[01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.410]  That was the beginning.
[01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:55.230]  That was the intro.
[01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:02.030]  Geoff is so hungry for lunch.
[01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:04.530]  Oh God, this is so...
[01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:07.550]  This is the problem with Machinima, right?
[01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:10.030]  The way we did it is that there were very...
[01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:16.030]  There were very few games that worked worth a damn.
[01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.650]  And if they did, they were usually FPS games.
[01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:24.030]  So any time we tried to make anything, it would just be like a bad version of Red vs. Blue.
[01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:28.190]  So it made it really hard for us to film in most shooters.
[01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:31.510]  Because you're just like making a parody of your own parody at that point, you know?
[01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:39.590]  I mean, this was definitely at a time where other people weren't really doing this.
[01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:43.310]  I think that's something we've talked about watching like these other ones,
[01:24:43.410 --> 01:24:44.690]  where we're just like, oh, woof.
[01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:48.430]  It's like this was a thing that people sought after, though.
[01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:52.410]  Like, just to have people that could do this was like, oh, shit.
[01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:53.630]  We want that.
[01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:58.870]  Also, to be fair, we got paid to make this.
[01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.500]  Like, we didn't...
[01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:01.310]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:04.630]  Like, this is a contract gig, and so I have no idea how much money we made,
[01:25:04.710 --> 01:25:06.470]  but I bet it was a shitload, you know?
[01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.350]  I bet it was probably hundreds of thousands to make this.
[01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:12.510]  Like, that's what we were saying, is that like, judging this by 2024,
[01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.370]  obviously it's like, oh, this is so goofy.
[01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:19.510]  It's like, right, but this is like when the internet was like hungry for this kind of thing.
[01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:22.610]  Yeah, yeah, but you know.
[01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:23.430]  Spell support.
[01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:27.270]  But still, not everything Citizen Kane, you know?
[01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.870]  Goddammit.
[01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:31.150]  Yeah, 1-800-MAGIC!
[01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.730]  Woo!
[01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:35.390]  Did we get the IP for that, Geoff?
[01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.410]  I don't think so.
[01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:38.350]  What?
[01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:39.030]  Come on.
[01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:40.650]  They're still trying to untangle that one.
[01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:42.410]  2007, wow.
[01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:43.990]  That was 17 years ago?
[01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:45.910]  Yeah, crazy, dude.
[01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.850]  And that's it.
[01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:47.450]  We did it.
[01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:48.430]  Well, guess what?
[01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:49.650]  Nick got here just in time.
[01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:52.610]  Nick, go ahead and do the outro for Ratatouille Part 5.
[01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:55.870]  Wow, thanks for joining us for Part 5 of Ratatouille.
[01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:58.810]  Wish I'd waited a minute.
[01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:03.930]  Say one quick thing before Nick takes over.
[01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:08.830]  You know what's funny is in 2007, I was probably really proud of that when it came out
[01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:15.150]  in the same way that I'm really proud that Episode 4 or Episode 3 of Regulation Podcast
[01:26:15.150 --> 01:26:15.870]  came out today.
[01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:20.310]  So do you think in 17 years, we'll look back at Episode 3 of Regulation Podcast and be
[01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:22.390]  so fucking embarrassed to have been a part of it?
[01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.510]  Yes, uh-huh.
[01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:25.610]  Correct, yeah, 100%.
[01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.170]  I don't...
[01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:27.590]  Probably the case too.
[01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:28.530]  Yeah.
[01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:29.550]  I don't think so.
[01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.370]  I think it's gonna age great.
[01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.990]  Yeah.
[01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:33.490]  Comedy always ages well.
[01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:36.810]  Yeah, oh, I think it's 100% of the time, yep.
[01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:43.690]  Anyway, thanks for watching Part 5.
[01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:47.430]  It's nice to have you here popping in at the end, Nick, as a tease.
[01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:48.250]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:50.190]  What do you think's gonna happen in Part 6, Nick?
[01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.010]  Are we eating cheese?
[01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:54.690]  Nick, I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[01:26:54.690 --> 01:26:58.130]  They screwed me out of three stars, or three coins.
[01:26:58.650 --> 01:27:00.950]  Do not let them fuck you out of your coins.
[01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:04.330]  They purport, they brag about how they're completionists,
[01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:06.950]  about how they love bonus content, about how they want to see it all,
[01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:11.050]  and then you roll up in there, and then you watch them not get it all,
[01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:13.010]  and then be like, oh, we'll get it next video.
[01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:15.670]  So don't let them do that shit to you.
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:16.750]  Don't lump me in with Andrew.
[01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:18.690]  I'm simply here.
[01:27:20.130 --> 01:27:20.930]  All I'm saying is...
[01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:21.750]  Eric's simply here.
[01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:26.190]  Much like the wonderful audience that watched this video.
[01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:27.410]  Thank you so much for tuning in.

[01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:34.910]  This is fun.
[01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:40.590]  And join us next time as we continue our 100% playthrough of Ratatouille.
[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:43.090]  You still owe me three gold Melba toasts.
[01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:43.770]  You're not wrong.
[01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:45.210]  I'll get them for you, Geoff.
