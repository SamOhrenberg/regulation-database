[00:00.000 --> 00:02.840]  Hello and welcome to Irregulation Gameplay. We're in FBC Firebreak.
[00:02.960 --> 00:04.100]  Geoff, did you ever play Control?
[00:04.820 --> 00:05.700]  No, never played it.
[00:05.780 --> 00:09.440]  It got recommended to me a lot, but it came out during that period when I wasn't gaming.
[00:09.620 --> 00:11.540]  Totally fair. It's a great game.
[00:11.620 --> 00:12.420]  You should revisit this.
[00:12.500 --> 00:16.460]  This game is set in the world of Control, but I don't think it's like heavily referencing.
[00:17.020 --> 00:18.520]  I don't think there's a lot of lore in this.
[00:19.000 --> 00:20.560]  Made by the same people that did Alan Wake?
[00:20.760 --> 00:22.580]  It sure is. It is a remedy game.
[00:23.240 --> 00:23.600]  Same universe.
[00:24.600 --> 00:27.100]  Are they? Does that mean?
[00:27.400 --> 00:28.260]  Oh, it is same universe?
[00:28.260 --> 00:28.520]  Yep.
[00:28.840 --> 00:29.820]  Great. That's what I was asking.
[00:30.420 --> 00:30.620]  OK.
[00:31.240 --> 00:34.480]  It's sort of a thing where all their games are kind of interconnected officially
[00:34.480 --> 00:36.520]  or like they kind of sneak it in.
[00:37.000 --> 00:42.220]  Like Alan Wake 2 had very clearly a Max Payne in it, but was not called Max Payne.
[00:43.240 --> 00:47.260]  Even though it used the face of the original Max Payne and the voice actor of Max Payne.
[00:48.460 --> 00:51.820]  The face of the head of the studio, which is wild, but.
[00:52.640 --> 00:54.300]  And RIP to the voice actor.
[00:54.940 --> 00:55.940]  Did you like Alan Wake 2?
[00:55.940 --> 00:57.200]  I loved it.
[00:57.260 --> 00:59.200]  It's maybe my favorite game of that year.
[00:59.320 --> 01:01.640]  Really? We played we did one Let's Play in it, right?
[01:01.800 --> 01:02.720]  We did. Yeah.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.620]  Was that **** Face or Regulation?
[01:04.820 --> 01:07.600]  That was Let's Play for **** Face.
[01:08.000 --> 01:08.760]  I believe. Yeah.
[01:08.760 --> 01:09.860]  So what do you know about this game?
[01:10.180 --> 01:11.400]  Oh, I already saw the hint.
[01:11.660 --> 01:13.960]  It's sort of a Left 4 Dead style
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.620]  loot based game, I guess.
[01:18.380 --> 01:20.000]  Oh, dude, I got a double barrel here.
[01:20.840 --> 01:23.880]  I just have a fucking 357 Magnum.
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.280]  Is this in the oldest house?
[01:25.280 --> 01:29.940]  Yes. So the plot is we play the cleanup crew in the oldest house
[01:29.940 --> 01:33.320]  and we have to go in and like deal with the bullshit that happens.
[01:33.820 --> 01:37.260]  So not only same universe, same freaking area.
[01:38.200 --> 01:38.380]  Yeah.
[01:39.600 --> 01:42.500]  Oh, left bumper, right bumper, right bumper, right bumper, left bumper, left bumper.
[01:42.920 --> 01:43.940]  I'm repairing something.
[01:44.680 --> 01:47.560]  If I played Control, I'd know what I'm doing right now.
[01:47.760 --> 01:49.160]  No. Whoops.
[01:50.500 --> 01:51.480]  Okay, well, I fixed the thing.
[01:52.740 --> 01:54.620]  I think we okay, so we got to repair the fans.
[01:56.380 --> 01:59.340]  So, oh, bad guys, bad guys, bad guys.
[02:00.260 --> 02:03.160]  Oh, shit. They just all spawned in over here.
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.660]  So I think what we're in right now is a safe room
[02:06.660 --> 02:09.580]  often contains valuable resources, but opening them often attracts new hits.
[02:09.980 --> 02:12.620]  OK, so because you guys opened that, all these dudes spawned.
[02:13.120 --> 02:14.780]  Oh, I see. So it's a blade.
[02:15.280 --> 02:17.460]  Yeah, I definitely opened it.
[02:17.780 --> 02:17.960]  Apologies.
[02:19.260 --> 02:23.180]  I was trying to fix this panel, but I accidentally hit the breakers with a wrench.
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.640]  Did that not do it?
[02:25.960 --> 02:27.220]  You found a lost asset.
[02:27.380 --> 02:30.140]  This is a valuable resource used to upgrade your equipment between matches.
[02:30.560 --> 02:33.660]  If you survive the job with it, all crewmates will receive a copy.
[02:34.220 --> 02:35.600]  Hell yeah. OK, well, let's live.
[02:36.080 --> 02:36.940]  Let's beat this thing.
[02:38.100 --> 02:39.080]  What's all this glowing shit?
[02:40.480 --> 02:41.140]  Or is that what that was?
[02:41.960 --> 02:45.940]  OK, so the water heals us, so like faucets and whatnot.
[02:46.900 --> 02:47.900]  Give some health.
[02:48.740 --> 02:50.340]  Can we extinguish these flames?
[02:50.640 --> 02:51.160]  Oh, we can.
[02:51.160 --> 02:53.900]  Uh. I have a water gun.
[02:54.820 --> 02:56.460]  I seem to be doing it with my mind.
[02:56.920 --> 02:59.560]  Ow. I just have an electricity gun, I guess.
[03:00.840 --> 03:03.020]  Maybe you're like really good at repairing stuff.
[03:04.720 --> 03:05.700]  Yeah, let's see.
[03:06.060 --> 03:08.540]  I played a little rhythm game to extinguish a fire.
[03:09.140 --> 03:10.300]  Oh, do you want to charge this, Geoff?
[03:10.820 --> 03:12.140]  I think so. Let me see.
[03:12.300 --> 03:14.960]  If you come over here, there's a prompt.
[03:16.320 --> 03:17.240]  It says ping.
[03:18.060 --> 03:19.560]  Oh, do you not have a prompt on it?
[03:20.060 --> 03:21.140]  Let me try it.
[03:21.440 --> 03:23.160]  I got I got a charge prompt.
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.280]  Yeah, so do I.
[03:26.260 --> 03:26.580]  OK.
[03:28.760 --> 03:29.380]  How do I?
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.800]  What do you think the chances are I had a prompt and I'm too stupid to see it?
[03:33.020 --> 03:34.780]  It was right in the middle of the screen.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.140]  So unless you weren't looking at it.
[03:36.280 --> 03:37.300]  All I had was ping.
[03:38.260 --> 03:40.760]  OK, well, I'm going to ping to see if that let's go this way.
[03:41.360 --> 03:43.580]  Andrew, how do I float up in the air and throw stuff with my mind?
[03:44.100 --> 03:46.160]  Uh, I believe you got to hold wide.
[03:50.060 --> 03:51.920]  I think we got to get this fan going.
[03:52.580 --> 03:56.680]  Control to me has maybe some of the best destruction physics I've played.
[03:58.780 --> 03:59.340]  Nice, Geoff.
[03:59.660 --> 04:01.980]  Oh, you did that so much faster than when I was trying to do it.
[04:02.080 --> 04:03.840]  That's definitely it still never gave me a prompt.
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.440]  I just saw an empty progress bar. OK.
[04:05.580 --> 04:06.120]  And I shot it.
[04:06.660 --> 04:08.020]  What's that? You guys see that?
[04:08.140 --> 04:09.580]  I think we might need to go back.
[04:10.360 --> 04:12.360]  Yeah, that electricity symbol. Yeah.
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.180]  We got a bunch of hits behind us.
[04:17.260 --> 04:17.980]  What do you call them?
[04:17.980 --> 04:20.140]  They're called his H.I.S.
[04:20.180 --> 04:21.900]  H.I.S.S. Are they snakes?
[04:22.680 --> 04:24.340]  No, they're like possessed.
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.360]  Well, we'll stop playing on here.
[04:27.480 --> 04:29.680]  Yeah, that's even if they were, I was going to say no.
[04:31.260 --> 04:32.840]  There's something we can do here that.
[04:33.940 --> 04:35.120]  You zap this thing or something.
[04:36.120 --> 04:38.580]  Unless it's just something they could destroy, we have to look after it.
[04:39.900 --> 04:44.180]  It says two meters when I this one is glowing to me right here.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.900]  Yeah, it has a two M on it, but I don't know what you do.
[04:48.260 --> 04:50.200]  It's not like slightly less sticky than three M.
[04:53.580 --> 04:55.460]  Maybe I'm supposed to do something.
[04:56.180 --> 04:57.760]  What other buttons do I have?
[04:58.920 --> 05:01.580]  So I got a flashlight and there's something in here in the fan.
[05:02.580 --> 05:04.500]  Oh, it's repairing this.
[05:05.860 --> 05:07.620]  It's not going to turn the fan on and grind.
[05:07.740 --> 05:09.940]  I bet it does. I really hope it doesn't.
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.940]  Oh, it did turn the fan on.
[05:13.320 --> 05:15.420]  Oh, oh, let me through.
[05:15.480 --> 05:16.200]  Let me through. Let me through.
[05:17.900 --> 05:19.100]  Get to the next zone.
[05:19.380 --> 05:20.200]  We got more guys.
[05:25.960 --> 05:27.220]  You got a shotgun or something?
[05:29.780 --> 05:33.440]  You can change the voice of your character in the customization screen.
[05:34.060 --> 05:35.360]  I got some water.
[05:35.880 --> 05:37.080]  Let's open up one of these
[05:38.500 --> 05:42.260]  doors over here that'll spawn enemies and get some more shit,
[05:42.440 --> 05:43.460]  some more upgrade material.
[05:44.860 --> 05:45.760]  All right, I'm ready for them.
[05:47.960 --> 05:49.860]  Oh, they're flying. We got guys in chairs.
[05:51.480 --> 05:51.820]  Got him.
[05:54.300 --> 05:55.320]  I'm popping in.
[05:55.920 --> 05:56.820]  We got what we got.
[05:57.900 --> 05:59.500]  This job site is dangerously hot.
[05:59.580 --> 06:00.620]  You'll continue to heat up while here.
[06:00.740 --> 06:02.920]  Remember to shower frequently or find ways to cool down.
[06:03.560 --> 06:04.300]  Oh, we're dealing with heat.
[06:04.380 --> 06:06.740]  I just noticed we have a flame symbol in the bottom left.
[06:07.440 --> 06:08.500]  I'm shooting you guys with water.
[06:08.580 --> 06:09.520]  I'm cooling everybody off.
[06:10.760 --> 06:11.960]  Nice. I'm the water boy.
[06:13.700 --> 06:14.600]  You're Bobby Boucher.
[06:14.740 --> 06:15.640]  I'm Bobby Boucher.
[06:20.740 --> 06:24.540]  Oh, I think we got like bullets in classified info bullets.
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.260]  Another one of these.
[06:28.180 --> 06:28.480]  Hell yeah.
[06:28.720 --> 06:30.060]  Another classified info.
[06:30.580 --> 06:32.400]  Nice. What's this?
[06:32.540 --> 06:34.480]  Got a. Oh.
[06:36.580 --> 06:37.280]  You're Geoff.
[06:37.700 --> 06:38.300]  Oh, I got a grenade.
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.340]  Geoff, pick this up.
[06:39.660 --> 06:40.020]  Try this.
[06:41.900 --> 06:43.260]  Oh, shoot shrapnel.
[06:45.000 --> 06:45.880]  Oh, dude.
[06:47.700 --> 06:49.360]  Oh, that's cool.
[06:49.660 --> 06:51.040]  Let's make sure we get like ammo.
[06:51.200 --> 06:53.060]  Let's get like make sure you're all ammoed up.
[06:53.640 --> 06:55.100]  Then we'll move to the next zone.
[06:55.980 --> 06:57.560]  There's something over here that glowy that.
[06:57.880 --> 06:59.080]  Oh, I grabbed that ice cream.
[06:59.940 --> 07:01.540]  Oh, OK. I think we got it.
[07:02.000 --> 07:02.680]  I'm healthed up.
[07:03.460 --> 07:07.120]  Oh, oh, shit.
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.200]  There's something on top of this.
[07:08.580 --> 07:09.200]  Let me climb up.
[07:11.800 --> 07:12.360]  What was that?
[07:12.880 --> 07:14.380]  It was one of those upgrade things.
[07:15.100 --> 07:17.260]  I think we may have left one in the other one.
[07:17.500 --> 07:18.760]  So I'm going to go back really quickly.
[07:19.460 --> 07:21.220]  Why does it still glow after they've gone?
[07:21.940 --> 07:22.880]  Might be a bug.
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.000]  Oh, they have put out a lot of updates for this game.
[07:27.620 --> 07:28.600]  How long has it been out?
[07:29.000 --> 07:29.720]  A few weeks.
[07:30.760 --> 07:31.900]  Oh, a shield over there.
[07:32.200 --> 07:33.800]  A shield only regenerates when we're close.
[07:34.540 --> 07:38.040]  OK, well, let's move as a unit to that 75.
[07:39.020 --> 07:41.220]  That's a great mechanic for getting people to stay together.
[07:44.820 --> 07:45.640]  Oh, more fire.
[07:46.460 --> 07:48.060]  Whenever I see fire, I just want to go...
[07:48.060 --> 07:50.780]  So you have a water cannon?
[07:51.080 --> 07:52.040]  I got a little water gun.
[07:52.100 --> 07:53.100]  It shoots little water balls.
[07:53.900 --> 07:54.280]  That's cool.
[07:54.740 --> 07:57.000]  I have to be... I want to shrapnel the fuck out of some people.
[07:57.220 --> 07:58.520]  I have to play a rhythm game.
[07:59.060 --> 07:59.860]  Oh, behind us.
[08:01.340 --> 08:01.880]  They're coming.
[08:02.540 --> 08:03.580]  I'm going to open this.
[08:04.520 --> 08:05.260]  Oh, that's a lot of them.
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.540]  Oh, Geoff just mowing them away.
[08:11.180 --> 08:12.240]  Oh, we got people in front, too.
[08:12.260 --> 08:13.220]  I'm working on the front people.
[08:15.680 --> 08:17.580]  OK, there's a lot of people in front.
[08:17.800 --> 08:18.900]  A whole bunch of them showed up.
[08:19.280 --> 08:19.600]  Grenade!
[08:21.500 --> 08:21.900]  Nice.
[08:24.420 --> 08:25.900]  All right, nobody behind us still.
[08:26.460 --> 08:27.880]  Oh, I hit 10 enemies with that grenade.
[08:27.960 --> 08:28.380]  I got an achievement.
[08:28.760 --> 08:29.300]  Oh, hell yeah.
[08:31.480 --> 08:32.220]  Oh, sorry.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.860]  What's this jet of something?
[08:35.120 --> 08:36.600]  We got to repair the transfer fans.
[08:36.800 --> 08:37.360]  One last dude.
[08:37.600 --> 08:38.280]  Yeah, big boy.
[08:41.040 --> 08:42.280]  I wonder what was back this way.
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.360]  I'm charging something.
[08:44.360 --> 08:45.780]  I don't know what it is.
[08:46.220 --> 08:47.800]  I'll do this one over here.
[08:47.940 --> 08:48.180]  OK.
[08:49.120 --> 08:53.260]  Oh, if you guys need to cool down to shower, shower over by me, I'll ping it.
[08:55.540 --> 08:55.900]  Shit.
[09:01.810 --> 09:03.850]  Yeah, we got to repair six more fans, I guess.
[09:08.140 --> 09:11.660]  So we can all do each other's jobs, I guess, but just slower than the main person.
[09:12.040 --> 09:13.500]  Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[09:13.500 --> 09:14.920]  I don't know if I can do water.
[09:16.320 --> 09:17.280]  I don't seem to be able to do...
[09:17.280 --> 09:17.980]  Aren't you the repair guy?
[09:18.440 --> 09:19.580]  Don't you have like a big wrench?
[09:20.800 --> 09:21.120]  Yeah.
[09:21.200 --> 09:22.760]  Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[09:22.880 --> 09:25.800]  I think you just might hit the items with it, like kind of Team Fortress style.
[09:26.140 --> 09:26.980]  His time, his time.
[09:27.860 --> 09:31.660]  Yeah, we are a little, little behind you, Geoff, to your right.
[09:31.820 --> 09:31.920]  Oh.
[09:32.940 --> 09:34.280]  Chairman, two chairman.
[09:34.420 --> 09:35.820]  People coming up on the right, we got a chairman.
[09:42.270 --> 09:42.590]  Hey.
[09:44.490 --> 09:45.570]  Oh, more spawning.
[09:46.110 --> 09:47.450]  I'm hitting the repairs on this.
[09:50.470 --> 09:53.190]  I think we ideally want to be doing this as fast as we can.
[09:53.650 --> 09:54.050]  Okay.
[09:56.930 --> 09:58.010]  We got four more.
[09:59.070 --> 10:00.090]  Oh, I'm getting low on ammo.
[10:01.490 --> 10:04.470]  I'm gonna have to start water blasting these guys with my super soaker.
[10:04.970 --> 10:05.930]  Get away, get away.
[10:07.070 --> 10:07.570]  Fuck you.
[10:07.650 --> 10:09.890]  Oh shit, what's this highlighted health thing over here?
[10:11.450 --> 10:13.210]  Highlighted? That's the shower back there.
[10:13.390 --> 10:14.670]  If you need to cool down.
[10:15.130 --> 10:16.030]  I don't think I need that.
[10:18.830 --> 10:20.310]  I already showered this morning.
[10:21.650 --> 10:22.490]  Look at you.
[10:26.110 --> 10:29.270]  There's one of those bunkers over here to the right, if we want to sync up.
[10:29.390 --> 10:30.230]  I think there's ammo in there.
[10:30.310 --> 10:32.490]  I don't know if you guys need it, but I am running low.
[10:32.510 --> 10:33.310]  Yeah, I could do with some.
[10:33.410 --> 10:33.970]  Oh, I'm hot.
[10:34.210 --> 10:35.610]  Maybe I do need a shower.
[10:35.810 --> 10:36.130]  Where are you?
[10:36.210 --> 10:37.430]  Come to me, come to me.
[10:37.550 --> 10:38.430]  Oh, Geoff, just let me.
[10:41.590 --> 10:42.150]  There you go.
[10:42.290 --> 10:43.350]  That help you when I hit you?
[10:44.290 --> 10:46.410]  I think that's my thing with the water gun.
[10:47.030 --> 10:48.150]  So is shower not for health?
[10:48.210 --> 10:49.650]  It's for hot or it is for health?
[10:49.750 --> 10:50.790]  I think it's both.
[10:50.790 --> 10:54.470]  I think in this one specifically, it's heat.
[10:54.630 --> 10:55.910]  And that's why we got to repair the fans.
[10:56.350 --> 10:58.270]  There's so many upgrade books in here.
[11:02.280 --> 11:03.580]  Let's try to funnel them in.
[11:03.780 --> 11:04.220]  Shit, the bed.
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.600]  Oh, shit, that hurt.
[11:06.340 --> 11:08.660]  Oh, someone set off the...
[11:08.660 --> 11:09.540]  The cooler.
[11:12.860 --> 11:13.260]  Okay.
[11:16.260 --> 11:18.420]  Not a lot of ammo in here, unfortunately.
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.280]  A lot of upgrade material.
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.600]  Another grenade over here, if anyone wants to grab it.
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.200]  Coffee pot, if anybody's thirsty.
[11:28.120 --> 11:28.980]  I'll take it with me.
[11:29.520 --> 11:30.960]  Keep it warm in this hot room.
[11:31.560 --> 11:32.440]  Oh, shit, one more.
[11:32.800 --> 11:32.940]  Yeah.
[11:33.860 --> 11:35.280]  Moving to the next fan.
[11:35.380 --> 11:38.600]  Let me put out this fire stuff.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.760]  So it looks like we got to go down.
[11:42.000 --> 11:42.960]  Can I shower first?
[11:43.460 --> 11:43.980]  Yeah, of course.
[11:45.040 --> 11:46.040]  Let me head back to you.
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.300]  Also, you can collect ammo in here.
[11:49.020 --> 11:49.940]  Oh, there's ammo over there?
[11:50.080 --> 11:50.480]  Hell yeah.
[11:50.580 --> 11:50.880]  Yeah.
[11:51.460 --> 11:52.480]  Good find, Geoff.
[11:53.340 --> 11:55.000]  Yeah, shower seems to be heat and health.
[11:55.680 --> 11:55.900]  Sweet.
[11:57.440 --> 11:59.080]  Oh, I got to do the little mechanic.
[11:59.460 --> 12:00.060]  I fucked it up.
[12:00.060 --> 12:01.660]  Oh, shower's health, too?
[12:01.800 --> 12:02.040]  Hell yeah.
[12:03.620 --> 12:04.320]  Yeah, it is.
[12:05.660 --> 12:06.020]  Sweet.
[12:07.400 --> 12:08.920]  Let me pop in there, too, with you.
[12:09.460 --> 12:10.380]  Wish I had...
[12:10.380 --> 12:11.760]  Oh, a little team shower.
[12:12.120 --> 12:12.280]  Oh!
[12:12.420 --> 12:12.820]  Team shower.
[12:12.920 --> 12:13.300]  More people.
[12:14.020 --> 12:14.680]  And we probably should...
[12:14.680 --> 12:17.020]  We should all only shower this way from now on.
[12:17.020 --> 12:17.480]  Yeah.
[12:20.140 --> 12:23.740]  I'm going to shower with a super soaker every time going forward.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.720]  Let's head down to the thing.
[12:27.400 --> 12:28.800]  No fall damage, it looks like.
[12:29.720 --> 12:32.580]  Imagine a video game where instead of fall damage, there was jump damage.
[12:32.940 --> 12:34.320]  Oh, that would suck!
[12:35.680 --> 12:39.020]  It feels like a fucked up level somebody would make in Mario Maker.
[12:39.680 --> 12:39.880]  Yeah.
[12:42.340 --> 12:44.020]  Oh, I finally get a fucking...
[12:44.020 --> 12:45.120]  There we go.
[12:45.280 --> 12:45.620]  A what?
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.420]  I finally got a prompt or something to do.
[12:49.860 --> 12:50.580]  It says repair.
[12:51.400 --> 12:52.160]  Repair that shit.
[12:52.420 --> 12:52.920]  Oh, I see.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.120]  I gotta...
[12:54.120 --> 12:55.160]  Can you hit the bumpers?
[12:56.140 --> 12:56.380]  Yeah.
[12:56.580 --> 12:57.740]  Can I just whack it with my wrench?
[12:59.220 --> 12:59.980]  I think you can.
[13:00.780 --> 13:02.060]  It goes much faster when you do it.
[13:02.920 --> 13:03.500]  More people!
[13:07.620 --> 13:08.340]  Very little...
[13:09.360 --> 13:09.940]  Oh, behind!
[13:10.040 --> 13:10.220]  Behind!
[13:10.320 --> 13:10.500]  Behind!
[13:10.620 --> 13:10.760]  Behind!
[13:12.780 --> 13:13.140]  Off.
[13:16.740 --> 13:17.980]  Oh, I got it.
[13:19.020 --> 13:20.260]  Taking care of the water.
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.780]  We still have a...
[13:22.780 --> 13:23.620]  I still have a...
[13:24.680 --> 13:26.480]  A wrench prompt down there.
[13:27.320 --> 13:27.720]  Whereabouts?
[13:29.120 --> 13:31.300]  Oh, there's something behind the thing again.
[13:32.240 --> 13:32.720]  The fan.
[13:35.720 --> 13:36.620]  You gonna go in and fix it?
[13:37.340 --> 13:38.200]  Yeah, I got it.
[13:38.680 --> 13:39.060]  Nice.
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.380]  Ah, shit.
[13:40.680 --> 13:41.620]  That was a me prompt.
[13:44.500 --> 13:45.540]  Coming over to help.
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.540]  Just cover you.
[13:47.560 --> 13:47.960]  Nice.
[13:48.480 --> 13:49.300]  Okay, we got three more.
[13:49.580 --> 13:50.440]  Just keep pushing up.
[13:55.350 --> 13:56.690]  I don't like that noise.
[13:57.370 --> 13:58.490]  Yeah, that seemed like a bad noise.
[13:59.030 --> 14:00.430]  I'm gonna get my wrench on with that thing.
[14:01.550 --> 14:01.870]  Nice.
[14:02.670 --> 14:03.290]  Okay, here they come.
[14:03.790 --> 14:04.710]  Oh, that seems to be a...
[14:04.710 --> 14:05.350]  Got a little cluster.
[14:05.990 --> 14:06.470]  A jeffer?
[14:07.310 --> 14:07.910]  Yeah, that's a me.
[14:08.290 --> 14:08.890]  That's the lightning.
[14:09.530 --> 14:10.370]  Oh, I'm in the fan.
[14:14.070 --> 14:14.950]  Okay, cleared.
[14:16.230 --> 14:17.330]  You guys repaired that?
[14:17.710 --> 14:18.070]  Nice.
[14:18.350 --> 14:20.170]  Yeah, that's very quick for me to do.
[14:20.690 --> 14:22.550]  Oh, there's another one in the fan down below.
[14:23.370 --> 14:23.670]  Okay.
[14:24.270 --> 14:26.770]  You wanna hop in and quickly smash that thing?
[14:27.290 --> 14:27.910]  I'll do it.
[14:33.070 --> 14:34.510]  Oh, that's so much faster.
[14:34.810 --> 14:35.050]  Okay.
[14:35.150 --> 14:35.390]  Yeah.
[14:35.730 --> 14:36.730]  Now we gotta go back.
[14:39.410 --> 14:40.810]  Oh, I don't mind being the wrenchman.
[14:41.430 --> 14:42.290]  That's a pretty good roll.
[14:45.030 --> 14:46.130]  How do we get up there?
[14:46.310 --> 14:49.770]  Is this level-by-level or procedurally generated?
[14:50.150 --> 14:50.810]  What do we...
[14:50.810 --> 14:52.230]  It's different jobs.
[14:52.530 --> 14:54.510]  Is this a campaign we're doing?
[14:55.230 --> 14:57.830]  I don't think it's narratively a campaign.
[14:58.210 --> 15:00.030]  I think it's just a bunch of weird sequences.
[15:01.530 --> 15:02.670]  Oh, we got a lot of assholes.
[15:03.030 --> 15:04.470]  And I am out of ammo.
[15:05.070 --> 15:05.890]  Coming back.
[15:06.930 --> 15:07.950]  I got two clips left.
[15:08.110 --> 15:08.370]  Melee.
[15:08.990 --> 15:09.430]  Melee.
[15:12.810 --> 15:13.990]  Let's take these guys out.
[15:14.130 --> 15:15.670]  Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[15:15.850 --> 15:16.690]  Serpentine, serpentine.
[15:17.690 --> 15:18.590]  Oh, what's this?
[15:20.090 --> 15:21.030]  Random upgrade thing.
[15:21.290 --> 15:21.450]  Cool.
[15:22.550 --> 15:25.130]  Okay, let's go fix that last fan.
[15:25.950 --> 15:27.230]  See if we can get out of here.
[15:30.230 --> 15:31.570]  I wonder if we get to meet the Jenna.
[15:32.510 --> 15:38.170]  That green seven above on my screen, Gavin's name, on the bottom left, or I guess mid-left.
[15:38.250 --> 15:39.410]  I think that's how many lives we have.
[15:40.250 --> 15:40.930]  Oh, damn.
[15:41.390 --> 15:42.610]  We haven't lost any yet, huh?
[15:43.270 --> 15:45.670]  Alright, I'm gonna shoot this bitch.
[15:46.650 --> 15:47.010]  Boom!
[15:48.270 --> 15:48.630]  Nice.
[15:50.390 --> 15:50.950]  Okay, next zone.
[15:53.130 --> 15:56.190]  I'm running low on ammo, so if we could try to speedrun.
[15:56.650 --> 15:57.290]  Oh, shit.
[15:59.750 --> 16:01.150]  You're on fire in a bad way.
[16:01.330 --> 16:01.810]  I'm burning up, I'm burning up.
[16:01.910 --> 16:02.270]  I'm dying, I'm dying.
[16:02.370 --> 16:02.730]  I'm down.
[16:03.330 --> 16:04.050]  Oh, shit.
[16:04.350 --> 16:05.150]  Is that just from the heat?
[16:05.710 --> 16:06.030]  Fuck.
[16:06.070 --> 16:06.510]  I think so.
[16:06.790 --> 16:07.170]  I think so.
[16:07.870 --> 16:09.210]  Oh, no, there's monsters.
[16:09.590 --> 16:10.310]  Okay, we gotta redeploy.
[16:11.450 --> 16:13.930]  I think we all ran into the fan immediately.
[16:14.810 --> 16:16.910]  Oh, we gotta go get all of our good loot back.
[16:16.990 --> 16:18.730]  We're spitting folders everywhere.
[16:19.590 --> 16:20.110]  Oh, no.
[16:20.770 --> 16:21.490]  Oh, shit.
[16:21.630 --> 16:22.850]  That was a nightmare.
[16:26.950 --> 16:28.910]  We were all like, oh, we're doing so good.
[16:28.990 --> 16:30.290]  We got all the lives in the world.
[16:31.670 --> 16:36.650]  I almost said, like 30 seconds before, I almost said, I think I really like this game.
[16:36.650 --> 16:38.130]  And then I thought, no, don't do that.
[16:39.630 --> 16:41.510]  But apparently just thinking it is enough.
[16:41.750 --> 16:42.450]  Oh, he's down here.
[16:42.490 --> 16:43.870]  I gotta go all the way down here to get that one.
[16:44.010 --> 16:44.150]  Okay.
[16:44.670 --> 16:45.970]  Oh, there's still some more down there, too.
[16:46.030 --> 16:46.450]  I got it.
[16:46.670 --> 16:47.210]  Two more.
[16:48.490 --> 16:49.230]  We get all of them?
[16:49.270 --> 16:49.730]  I think we did.
[16:50.070 --> 16:50.730]  Yeah, I think we did.
[16:50.990 --> 16:51.230]  Okay.
[16:51.950 --> 16:52.850]  Do we go down?
[16:53.090 --> 16:53.530]  And across?
[16:54.450 --> 16:54.770]  Maybe?
[16:55.670 --> 16:56.590]  Let's just go this way.
[16:56.650 --> 16:57.530]  Yeah, it's this way.
[17:00.570 --> 17:01.490]  Oh, we got more spawning.
[17:03.990 --> 17:04.590]  Maybe not.
[17:04.690 --> 17:05.690]  Oh, yep, yep, yep.
[17:05.690 --> 17:06.290]  For sure.
[17:07.410 --> 17:08.850]  Holy shit, there's a lot of them.
[17:10.430 --> 17:10.910]  It's okay.
[17:11.270 --> 17:11.910]  Oh, we got a big boy.
[17:15.450 --> 17:17.390]  Is he shooting, like, grenades at us?
[17:17.710 --> 17:18.710]  Or is that us?
[17:19.950 --> 17:21.570]  I'm not shooting grenades at anybody.
[17:22.350 --> 17:23.750]  Oh, yeah, he's got, like, a grenade launcher.
[17:24.870 --> 17:25.810]  I'm gonna double tap him.
[17:27.990 --> 17:29.230]  Oh, he's so weak.
[17:29.330 --> 17:29.610]  Nice.
[17:30.250 --> 17:30.810]  Okay, one more.
[17:31.730 --> 17:32.290]  Let's go.
[17:37.350 --> 17:38.750]  I hope we can evac soon.
[17:38.830 --> 17:39.850]  We have all those folders.
[17:39.910 --> 17:41.110]  I want to be able to upgrade shit.
[17:41.670 --> 17:42.670]  Where's our folder count?
[17:42.750 --> 17:43.370]  Does it say somewhere?
[17:43.690 --> 17:45.370]  I don't know where it is.
[17:46.110 --> 17:47.410]  Probably in, like, the end screen.
[17:47.910 --> 17:48.970]  Okay, I'm opening this door.
[17:50.770 --> 17:51.490]  Geoff, you okay?
[17:52.090 --> 17:52.710]  I think so.
[17:52.970 --> 17:53.210]  Okay.
[17:53.410 --> 17:54.270]  I just went a different way.
[17:55.790 --> 17:56.590]  Oh, shit.
[17:56.730 --> 17:57.190]  Oh, no.
[17:57.930 --> 17:58.330]  Bad.
[17:59.270 --> 18:00.290]  Bunch of fire guys.
[18:01.910 --> 18:02.690]  I remember the furnace.
[18:02.690 --> 18:03.170]  I'm gonna take out the furnace.
[18:03.670 --> 18:04.470]  I've been in this room.
[18:06.070 --> 18:08.710]  Fill empty barrels with black rock at filling station.
[18:08.850 --> 18:10.490]  Send filled barrels into the furnace.
[18:10.930 --> 18:11.310]  Okay.
[18:13.770 --> 18:14.590]  Oh, shit.
[18:15.450 --> 18:16.130]  I got you, Andrew.
[18:16.190 --> 18:16.450]  Hold on.
[18:16.930 --> 18:18.890]  I need to pay closer attention to my heat bar.
[18:19.370 --> 18:20.410]  That's what I need to be doing.
[18:21.230 --> 18:21.670]  I went down.
[18:22.290 --> 18:22.650]  Shit.
[18:23.290 --> 18:25.890]  I think Gavin and I need to pay closer attention to our heat bars.
[18:27.350 --> 18:29.670]  If I had to guess, I'd say that's why I went down.
[18:31.130 --> 18:31.530]  Uh...
[18:31.530 --> 18:36.690]  You know, maybe we should be more strategic about redeploying.
[18:36.750 --> 18:40.190]  Maybe one of us should redeploy and go back and pick the other two up.
[18:40.390 --> 18:41.270]  I was just thinking that.
[18:43.370 --> 18:44.230]  Okay, let's go in.
[18:44.270 --> 18:45.130]  Let's get our folders again.
[18:45.210 --> 18:45.690]  Let's be careful.
[18:45.750 --> 18:48.910]  I don't know if the furnace, like, also shot out and that's what got us.
[18:49.710 --> 18:51.670]  Like, it almost seemed like it blasted.
[18:52.810 --> 18:54.150]  Yeah, let's keep an eye on it.
[18:55.770 --> 18:56.250]  Okay.
[18:59.010 --> 19:00.350]  Our heat's getting up there.
[19:00.970 --> 19:02.290]  Yeah, I'm watching.
[19:02.490 --> 19:03.050]  I'm cooling.
[19:03.770 --> 19:04.150]  Nice.
[19:04.250 --> 19:04.530]  Very well.
[19:04.550 --> 19:04.790]  Nice.
[19:06.510 --> 19:06.990]  Thank you.
[19:11.240 --> 19:12.720]  Okay, let's move down.
[19:13.820 --> 19:15.760]  Alright, can I take the shield from the heat?
[19:16.260 --> 19:16.440]  No.
[19:17.480 --> 19:17.720]  No.
[19:18.400 --> 19:18.940]  Pick up.
[19:19.120 --> 19:19.640]  Pick up.
[19:20.120 --> 19:21.300]  Oh, more behind.
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.300]  A whole bunch behind us.
[19:23.300 --> 19:24.240]  Where are we throwing it?
[19:24.260 --> 19:24.860]  Just in the furnace?
[19:24.860 --> 19:25.700]  I'm not sure.
[19:26.380 --> 19:27.340]  We should group up.
[19:27.540 --> 19:28.680]  The heat's getting high.
[19:31.480 --> 19:32.420]  Right next to you, I guess.
[19:32.820 --> 19:33.020]  Yeah.
[19:35.780 --> 19:38.920]  Place empty barrels into black rock dispensers to fill them.
[19:39.820 --> 19:40.040]  Okay.
[19:40.320 --> 19:41.800]  Wherever those are.
[19:42.420 --> 19:42.920]  I'm getting hot.
[19:43.100 --> 19:45.060]  Am I a stupid bastard?
[19:45.200 --> 19:46.320]  Where's the black rock dispenser?
[19:47.120 --> 19:47.900]  I don't know, Andrew.
[19:47.920 --> 19:48.480]  I'm getting hot.
[19:48.660 --> 19:49.380]  Okay, okay, here.
[19:49.900 --> 19:50.320]  Group up.
[19:50.760 --> 19:51.480]  Oh, thank you.
[19:51.580 --> 19:52.640]  Oh, it feels so good.
[19:52.960 --> 19:54.340]  Oh, God, thank you.
[19:54.860 --> 19:56.260]  I don't think I was gonna make it for a second.
[19:56.880 --> 19:57.740]  Up the stairs.
[19:57.940 --> 19:58.380]  Up the stairs?
[19:59.260 --> 20:00.040]  Yeah, drop point.
[20:00.120 --> 20:00.900]  Here's the drop point.
[20:03.260 --> 20:03.980]  It's right here, guys.
[20:04.280 --> 20:05.440]  Okay, get in cover.
[20:05.520 --> 20:05.920]  Get in the cover.
[20:07.280 --> 20:07.980]  Get behind something.
[20:08.480 --> 20:08.780]  Get behind.
[20:13.140 --> 20:14.200]  Yeah, that'll do it.
[20:16.780 --> 20:17.760]  Geoff, how you doing for heat?
[20:18.260 --> 20:19.000]  I'm a little hot.
[20:20.240 --> 20:20.820]  Okay, I'm better.
[20:21.440 --> 20:21.760]  Place.
[20:22.600 --> 20:23.160]  Oh, there we go.
[20:23.720 --> 20:24.540]  Why did I place it the other way?
[20:24.560 --> 20:25.160]  Just put them right here.
[20:25.620 --> 20:26.500]  It'll fix itself.
[20:27.580 --> 20:28.300]  Or at least it did for me earlier.
[20:28.300 --> 20:29.020]  People on the right, people on the right.
[20:29.460 --> 20:32.640]  And then we, I think we gotta drop them down those zip lines once they're fully charged in.
[20:32.720 --> 20:33.760]  So let's get them in those sensors.
[20:38.880 --> 20:39.200]  Okay.
[20:39.720 --> 20:40.040]  Alright.
[20:42.180 --> 20:43.840]  Deliver filled barrels to the furnace.
[20:44.660 --> 20:45.600]  Okay, I got one charged.
[20:46.980 --> 20:48.780]  Yeah, I'm putting it on the zip line.
[20:53.390 --> 20:54.450]  Putting it on the zip line.
[20:55.190 --> 20:55.910]  Oh, I'm getting hot.
[20:56.070 --> 20:56.870]  Oh, I'm getting hot.
[20:57.090 --> 20:57.190]  I'm a bust.
[20:57.190 --> 20:58.690]  Okay, group up, group up, group up, group up.
[20:58.830 --> 20:59.550]  Right next to Gavin.
[20:59.930 --> 21:00.510]  Oh, God.
[21:02.330 --> 21:03.530]  How do you know when they're done?
[21:04.030 --> 21:05.810]  They start glowing purple.
[21:10.800 --> 21:12.220]  Is that Geoffrey Dean Morgan?
[21:12.980 --> 21:14.140]  It kind of sounds like it.
[21:14.680 --> 21:18.220]  Have you watched that TV show he's the host of?
[21:18.720 --> 21:18.860]  No.
[21:18.900 --> 21:19.440]  Destination X.
[21:19.820 --> 21:20.460]  I'm watching it.
[21:20.620 --> 21:20.860]  It's alright.
[21:22.640 --> 21:23.380]  Is it a reality show?
[21:23.940 --> 21:30.080]  Yeah, they take a bunch of people and they put them in a bus, they black out the windows, and then they just drive them around Europe and they have to figure out where they are.
[21:31.460 --> 21:35.900]  Sometimes they'll just open the window or let them go outside and walk around the neighborhood and they'll go like, alright, where do you think you are?
[21:36.640 --> 21:40.180]  And the person who gets it the farthest away gets sent home.
[21:40.760 --> 21:45.040]  They give them a map and say, point to where you are on the map, and the person who's the furthest away from where they are...
[21:45.040 --> 21:46.560]  I would just look at the stamp in my passport.
[21:49.560 --> 21:51.500]  All that's being taken care of for them, I think.
[21:51.880 --> 21:52.040]  Okay.
[21:53.320 --> 21:54.280]  Getting pretty low on ammo.
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.060]  So am I, I'm completely out, I'm just...
[22:00.920 --> 22:01.960]  Okay, okay, okay.
[22:01.960 --> 22:09.900]  I have... Oh, there's... Is that gonna be ammo over there?
[22:11.220 --> 22:13.340]  Oh yeah, I think that's ammo. Good call, Geoff.
[22:15.100 --> 22:17.920]  Oh, that's a shower. There's probably an ammo equivalent.
[22:25.760 --> 22:26.160]  Achieving!
[22:26.160 --> 22:28.040]  I have one bullet left. Let me use it for me.
[22:28.940 --> 22:31.900]  Oh no! Oh no! Oh shit!
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.280]  Just melee him, stay in the shower, stay in the shower and melee him.
[22:38.180 --> 22:38.780]  You just keep healing.
[22:41.600 --> 22:42.360]  Shit. Shitbox.
[22:46.860 --> 22:49.160]  Yeah, ammo's on this side. Once you guys are good.
[22:49.740 --> 22:51.760]  I'm gonna go run through this fucking barrel real fast.
[22:55.830 --> 22:57.650]  I don't know how many more of those we gotta do, you know?
[22:57.850 --> 22:59.770]  Yeah, I think we got enough, I'd assume.
[23:00.750 --> 23:02.850]  But, I don't wanna have to go back.
[23:06.290 --> 23:08.530]  Okay, fire, heat, heat.
[23:11.460 --> 23:13.100]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[23:14.220 --> 23:14.860]  Where's Geoff?
[23:15.460 --> 23:18.120]  I'm right here, I'm getting hot, I'm getting hot, I'm getting real hot.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.780]  Let's zipline over, I think we have enough.
[23:27.810 --> 23:28.290]  Zipline.
[23:31.890 --> 23:32.610]  Running up.
[23:35.430 --> 23:37.790]  It's gonna be funny, it's gonna need, you need two.
[23:40.570 --> 23:41.070]  Oh shit.
[23:41.190 --> 23:41.790]  Flare, flare.
[23:42.870 --> 23:43.530]  Getting cover.
[23:44.490 --> 23:44.850]  Shit.
[23:46.290 --> 23:47.030]  Is this cover?
[23:47.530 --> 23:47.890]  Shit.
[23:48.710 --> 23:49.030]  Oh!
[23:52.320 --> 23:53.280]  Oh, I got, I'm fucked.
[23:53.300 --> 23:53.900]  Fucking him up.
[23:54.500 --> 23:55.440]  Oh, help me, help me.
[23:55.480 --> 23:56.260]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[23:57.100 --> 23:57.820]  I'm so hot.
[23:58.320 --> 23:59.600]  Okay, let's load these barrels in.
[24:00.260 --> 24:01.120]  Alright, how do we do this?
[24:01.140 --> 24:03.660]  We got three more, just run up to the zipline and hold X.
[24:03.780 --> 24:03.960]  Okay.
[24:03.960 --> 24:05.320]  Okay, same as, same as the other way.
[24:05.480 --> 24:05.540]  Okay.
[24:06.160 --> 24:06.840]  That's one.
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.100]  Okay, we need one more.
[24:09.260 --> 24:09.820]  Putting it on.
[24:10.240 --> 24:11.040]  Another flare, guys.
[24:11.220 --> 24:11.420]  Another flare.
[24:14.020 --> 24:14.380]  Oh!
[24:15.020 --> 24:15.380]  Nice!
[24:15.420 --> 24:15.800]  I think we did it.
[24:16.300 --> 24:19.720]  The furnace is neutralized, you can now get close enough to repair it.
[24:19.780 --> 24:19.960]  Okay.
[24:22.140 --> 24:23.080]  We gotta fix this furnace.
[24:23.700 --> 24:25.160]  Oh shit, shit, shit!
[24:25.960 --> 24:26.320]  Dammit!
[24:26.320 --> 24:27.000]  Go, go, go, go!
[24:27.300 --> 24:27.660]  No!
[24:27.880 --> 24:28.240]  Geoff!
[24:28.400 --> 24:29.140]  How do you get off?
[24:31.920 --> 24:32.280]  Guys!
[24:35.760 --> 24:37.320]  Back up, back up!
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.120]  I'm back down.
[24:38.820 --> 24:39.080]  Oh shit!
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.940]  Dammit, I don't think I can do anything for you.
[24:41.380 --> 24:42.080]  I'll redeploy.
[24:42.960 --> 24:45.120]  I burned up all the frickin' papers.
[24:46.400 --> 24:46.720]  Oh!
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.320]  I couldn't figure out how to jump off.
[24:52.860 --> 24:54.260]  I couldn't either, how do you do it?
[24:54.900 --> 24:55.620]  I'm down!
[24:56.800 --> 24:57.220]  Oh no!
[24:58.500 --> 24:59.780]  Don't worry, Andrew, I'll get you in just a second.
[24:59.780 --> 25:02.720]  I don't think it's necessarily a jump off thing, it's a never get on.
[25:02.720 --> 25:05.020]  Yeah, yeah, you're right about that.
[25:05.480 --> 25:07.780]  I can't reload fast enough.
[25:07.980 --> 25:08.100]  I'm down.
[25:08.260 --> 25:09.520]  Alright Gavin, we're just gonna be down.
[25:09.620 --> 25:10.540]  You gotta come get us.
[25:11.160 --> 25:16.140]  Oh, if we lose this mission because you guys went face first into the furnace.
[25:18.660 --> 25:19.340]  Furnace face.
[25:19.940 --> 25:20.720]  Which way is it?
[25:21.500 --> 25:23.080]  Oh Gavin, it looks like you're getting closer.
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.120]  You guys are just beating the dicks out of me.
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.220]  Oh look, they're hitting each other on accident, that's nice.
[25:30.780 --> 25:31.500]  Oh Gavin.
[25:34.340 --> 25:34.820]  Shit!
[25:35.000 --> 25:35.360]  There you are.
[25:36.960 --> 25:37.780]  Are you gonna make it?
[25:38.020 --> 25:38.800]  You're gonna make it, buddy.
[25:41.740 --> 25:42.500]  Come on!
[25:43.480 --> 25:45.460]  Oh Gavin, you hero, you legend.
[25:46.460 --> 25:48.680]  I'm really nervous, he has such low health.
[25:49.300 --> 25:49.700]  What happened?
[25:50.080 --> 25:52.260]  Oh now I can't frickin' even ride the-
[25:52.900 --> 25:54.080]  Oh no Gavin.
[25:54.100 --> 25:54.920]  There's so many behind you.
[25:54.920 --> 25:55.860]  Don't look behind you.
[25:55.860 --> 25:56.780]  There are so many coming.
[25:56.780 --> 25:59.200]  Just focus on the four in front of you.
[26:00.380 --> 26:01.280]  Get us quick.
[26:02.180 --> 26:03.640]  Get Andrew before me.
[26:04.560 --> 26:05.260]  Thank you.
[26:06.020 --> 26:06.960]  Oh that's interesting.
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.280]  The longer we bleed out, the longer it takes for you to revive.
[26:09.400 --> 26:10.100]  Okay, you get him.
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.120]  I'm on these guys.
[26:16.180 --> 26:17.360]  Man, my health sucks.
[26:17.440 --> 26:18.060]  I need a shower.
[26:18.500 --> 26:19.460]  Okay, here.
[26:20.720 --> 26:22.760]  I can give a little bit of cooling.
[26:23.500 --> 26:23.840]  Thank you.
[26:24.620 --> 26:24.960]  Alright.
[26:25.300 --> 26:26.660]  Okay, we gotta repair this other side.
[26:27.180 --> 26:28.480]  Should I try and zip back to the shower?
[26:29.660 --> 26:30.040]  No.
[26:30.680 --> 26:31.040]  Okay.
[26:31.540 --> 26:32.380]  I think we're almost done.
[26:35.420 --> 26:35.760]  Okay.
[26:36.500 --> 26:38.840]  Oh, there goes all our folders that you grabbed.
[26:40.000 --> 26:40.340]  All.
[26:41.720 --> 26:42.900]  Okay, we gotta call the elevator.
[26:43.860 --> 26:44.500]  Oh fuck.
[26:44.560 --> 26:44.720]  Go.
[26:44.840 --> 26:45.140]  Just go.
[26:45.200 --> 26:45.440]  Just go.
[26:45.500 --> 26:45.740]  Just go.
[26:45.760 --> 26:46.100]  Just run.
[26:46.200 --> 26:46.360]  Run.
[26:46.540 --> 26:46.560]  Run.
[26:46.660 --> 26:46.820]  Run.
[26:49.080 --> 26:49.760]  Oh fuck.
[26:49.820 --> 26:51.280]  We gotta kill Sandra Johnson.
[26:53.300 --> 26:53.940]  Who is she?
[26:54.220 --> 26:56.420]  I don't know, but let's run to the showers.
[26:56.540 --> 26:57.120]  Let's get ammo.
[26:57.240 --> 26:58.280]  Let's get showered up.
[27:03.730 --> 27:04.410]  Oh fuck.
[27:04.450 --> 27:04.750]  Oh fuck.
[27:04.790 --> 27:05.010]  Oh fuck.
[27:07.130 --> 27:09.530]  Oh, you had so many behind you again, Gavin.
[27:10.010 --> 27:11.570]  Yeah, I'm just not focusing on it.
[27:11.570 --> 27:11.850]  To the showers.
[27:12.150 --> 27:12.690]  To the showers.
[27:12.830 --> 27:13.050]  To the showers.
[27:13.710 --> 27:14.250]  Group shower.
[27:14.610 --> 27:15.170]  Oh no.
[27:15.410 --> 27:16.210]  Oh god.
[27:16.390 --> 27:17.010]  It's a juggernaut.
[27:17.210 --> 27:19.730]  Oh shit, he's got the fucking grenade launcher thing.
[27:20.330 --> 27:20.970]  Showering up.
[27:21.430 --> 27:22.470]  Does anyone have a grenade?
[27:23.710 --> 27:24.370]  I did.
[27:27.390 --> 27:31.730]  Okay, chair guy's down.
[27:31.870 --> 27:32.450]  Chair guy's down.
[27:32.790 --> 27:34.010]  Oh, that's the boss over there.
[27:34.070 --> 27:34.530]  That's Sandra.
[27:36.990 --> 27:37.990]  Eat shit, Sandra.
[27:38.550 --> 27:39.050]  Come here, woman.
[27:39.350 --> 27:40.030]  Sandra.
[27:40.590 --> 27:41.530]  What are you doing?
[27:42.930 --> 27:43.390]  Flanking.
[27:44.010 --> 27:44.970]  Flank central.
[27:46.790 --> 27:50.130]  Yeah, we're doing great damage.
[27:51.590 --> 27:52.350]  Ammo.
[27:53.510 --> 27:54.550]  Getting more.
[27:55.370 --> 27:56.090]  Reinforcements.
[27:58.790 --> 27:59.530]  Reloading.
[27:59.950 --> 28:01.690]  She dropped a shitload of folders.
[28:02.750 --> 28:03.050]  Oh great.
[28:03.550 --> 28:04.450]  You killed her?
[28:05.110 --> 28:05.290]  Yeah.
[28:05.530 --> 28:05.770]  Yeah.
[28:08.110 --> 28:08.910]  Oh god.
[28:09.010 --> 28:09.690]  Damn, dude.
[28:10.530 --> 28:12.210]  There are so many people.
[28:12.210 --> 28:13.150]  I'm done on ammo.
[28:13.270 --> 28:13.730]  I need more ammo.
[28:15.350 --> 28:16.150]  Oh fuck.
[28:17.350 --> 28:18.530]  Okay, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
[28:19.730 --> 28:20.610]  I'm in the shower.
[28:21.130 --> 28:22.390]  Can someone help me?
[28:22.650 --> 28:23.790]  I'm working, I'm working on it.
[28:23.850 --> 28:24.490]  I'm trying my best.
[28:25.130 --> 28:25.750]  Okay, I got you.
[28:28.310 --> 28:29.410]  I got most of them.
[28:30.710 --> 28:31.070]  Oh!
[28:33.750 --> 28:40.280]  Man, my health just went down while I was making ammo.
[28:41.660 --> 28:42.620]  Oh, there's still...
[28:42.620 --> 28:44.760]  I didn't even notice they're just wailing on you.
[28:45.240 --> 28:45.960]  There's two behind you, Andrew.
[28:46.140 --> 28:46.880]  I'm getting you, I'm getting you.
[28:47.300 --> 28:47.820]  I'm getting you.
[28:47.860 --> 28:48.480]  I don't even care.
[28:48.560 --> 28:49.640]  I'm not even focused on them.
[28:51.940 --> 28:52.300]  Nice.
[28:52.420 --> 28:52.660]  Thank you.
[28:53.480 --> 28:54.660]  Now I need ammo again.
[28:58.220 --> 28:58.980]  Alright, sorted.
[28:58.980 --> 29:01.980]  I wish I could make a grenade.
[29:04.040 --> 29:05.420]  Oh, the ammo station is unpowered.
[29:05.560 --> 29:07.360]  Charge it first to collect ammo faster.
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.980]  Man, hanging out in the showers is the way to go.
[29:14.020 --> 29:16.440]  Can I repower the ammo station if we need it before we head out?
[29:17.680 --> 29:19.060]  Do we also have to repower the shower?
[29:21.120 --> 29:21.900]  I assume.
[29:22.720 --> 29:23.380]  What's this?
[29:23.860 --> 29:24.580]  Someone call a plumber.
[29:25.100 --> 29:26.180]  I think I got a grenade or something.
[29:26.520 --> 29:27.320]  Yeah, let's just go.
[29:27.420 --> 29:27.920]  Let's get to this.
[29:29.040 --> 29:29.940]  Shitloads spawning in.
[29:30.080 --> 29:30.920]  Powerful enemy.
[29:32.280 --> 29:33.340]  Oh, it's Joan.
[29:33.620 --> 29:35.500]  We gotta take out Joan now.
[29:35.920 --> 29:36.280]  Do we?
[29:37.100 --> 29:39.720]  Yeah, it won't let us call the elevator until Joan's down.
[29:40.740 --> 29:41.600]  Where is Joan?
[29:41.640 --> 29:42.580]  Oh, it's behind us.
[29:42.740 --> 29:43.320]  Oh, Gavin.
[29:43.700 --> 29:44.600]  Oh, Gavin.
[29:45.800 --> 29:47.520]  Alright, I'm hanging out in the shower again.
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.500]  Let them come to us.
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.620]  Yeah, we're kind of funneling them.
[29:54.680 --> 29:56.220]  The chair people are taking shots.
[29:56.260 --> 29:56.820]  Alright, that's Joan.
[29:57.920 --> 29:58.480]  Now I'm freezing.
[29:58.880 --> 30:00.620]  Oh, they got like a chain gun.
[30:01.600 --> 30:02.900]  She got like cold gun?
[30:03.880 --> 30:05.420]  Was she freezing you with it?
[30:05.520 --> 30:05.740]  Yeah.
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.060]  Well, something was.
[30:07.540 --> 30:07.780]  Okay.
[30:09.700 --> 30:10.480]  Half health.
[30:11.060 --> 30:12.980]  Oh, there's so many more spawning in behind her.
[30:14.500 --> 30:15.120]  Oh, yeah.
[30:15.120 --> 30:15.960]  She freezes.
[30:16.160 --> 30:16.920]  That sucks.
[30:18.500 --> 30:19.000]  She's down.
[30:19.100 --> 30:19.700]  Joan's down.
[30:20.800 --> 30:22.920]  Let's grab those folders and then...
[30:23.900 --> 30:25.060]  There's another juggernaut back there.
[30:25.600 --> 30:27.000]  Oh, shit.
[30:27.980 --> 30:28.660]  I'm out of bullets.
[30:28.780 --> 30:30.440]  Don't worry, Gavin. We'll get you in just a second.
[30:30.900 --> 30:31.640]  Alright, here we go.
[30:37.300 --> 30:39.840]  I had to pick everything up before it would let me pick you up.
[30:40.620 --> 30:41.640]  There's ammo on the right there.
[30:41.680 --> 30:42.600]  What are you doing to me?
[30:42.700 --> 30:43.060]  Oh, thanks.
[30:43.460 --> 30:44.300]  Don't worry about it, dude.
[30:44.520 --> 30:45.180]  You got up, didn't you?
[30:45.540 --> 30:45.660]  Yeah.
[30:48.640 --> 30:50.640]  Listen, that's what therapy's for in a couple years.
[30:52.520 --> 30:53.920]  Okay, let's head to the elevator.
[30:56.800 --> 30:57.660]  Oh, shit. More ammo.
[30:58.020 --> 30:58.260]  Oh.
[30:58.660 --> 30:59.280]  Should we shower up?
[30:59.420 --> 31:00.280]  More ammo, more shower.
[31:00.280 --> 31:03.280]  I'm getting in the shower.
[31:03.880 --> 31:05.000]  You gotta get in the shower.
[31:05.120 --> 31:06.340]  Just fucking stay in the shower.
[31:06.420 --> 31:06.600]  Showering up.
[31:07.340 --> 31:08.660]  Let me in the shower, you dick!
[31:10.100 --> 31:10.700]  Get in.
[31:11.880 --> 31:12.440]  The water's great.
[31:14.880 --> 31:15.320]  Okay.
[31:15.680 --> 31:15.960]  Alright.
[31:24.390 --> 31:25.550]  Coming up from behind.
[31:28.150 --> 31:30.270]  Keep going straight, I guess?
[31:30.950 --> 31:31.250]  Yeah.
[31:33.970 --> 31:37.530]  Bet you it's one of those elevators that take a long time to get to us.
[31:39.890 --> 31:41.610]  Oh, you got people chasing you.
[31:41.910 --> 31:42.350]  Someone, I don't know who that was.
[31:42.350 --> 31:45.050]  I need to switch it from toggle sprint to hold to sprint.
[31:47.270 --> 31:48.530]  Oh, we got a lot of guys coming.
[31:48.650 --> 31:49.570]  Let's get this going.
[31:52.490 --> 31:53.210]  Oh, shit.
[31:53.790 --> 31:56.210]  Oh, let's get the shower going, huh?
[31:59.920 --> 32:01.240]  Okay, have you coming up on the left?
[32:05.330 --> 32:07.390]  We got a shower and ammo on the door.
[32:11.900 --> 32:15.740]  What's the little yellow icon on our names with the three tiers?
[32:16.280 --> 32:17.440]  Is that our rank or something?
[32:17.820 --> 32:20.320]  Yeah, that's either like rank or folders, maybe? I don't know.
[32:20.740 --> 32:21.520]  Oh, there's stuff in here.
[32:22.100 --> 32:23.580]  I'm gonna get to the shower and see if there's a grenade.
[32:24.380 --> 32:24.840]  Oh, there's stuff?
[32:25.000 --> 32:26.000]  There's folders and shit in here.
[32:26.020 --> 32:26.360]  Oh, cool.
[32:27.080 --> 32:27.840]  Good find, Geoff.
[32:28.720 --> 32:29.800]  Okay, we're almost ready to go.
[32:31.140 --> 32:31.680]  Elevator's here.
[32:34.760 --> 32:35.260]  Bye, guys.
[32:35.260 --> 32:37.560]  Let's get the fuck out of here.
[32:41.840 --> 32:42.820]  Exit drop site.
[32:46.920 --> 32:47.740]  There we go.
[32:49.420 --> 32:53.620]  I think you flipped to leave the site, Geoff, and I didn't know I could flip it back.
[32:56.680 --> 32:57.700]  That was fun.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.360]  Hell yeah, that was fun.
[33:00.360 --> 33:01.140]  That was a good game.
[33:01.400 --> 33:03.820]  116 kills, 169 kills.
[33:04.900 --> 33:06.040]  This is awesome.
[33:08.560 --> 33:10.880]  Level 34, whatever that is.
[33:14.420 --> 33:16.760]  New equipment can be obtained through requisitions.
[33:17.360 --> 33:19.580]  Basic firebreaker gear can be unlocked and upgraded.
[33:21.400 --> 33:25.020]  For your first new piece of equipment, you can collect gunpowder grenade.
[33:25.340 --> 33:25.680]  Hell yeah.
[33:26.800 --> 33:27.420]  Requisition.
[33:29.260 --> 33:30.640]  Gunpowder grenade, yes.
[33:31.600 --> 33:32.640]  Yes, I want it.
[33:33.520 --> 33:35.420]  Perks improve offensive...
[33:35.420 --> 33:36.860]  Okay, so we can get perks.
[33:36.860 --> 33:39.200]  Oh, yeah, I want to sprint for longer.
[33:39.380 --> 33:40.920]  I want to sprint all the time.
[33:42.220 --> 33:44.160]  Even locked athlete, you can return to the research for one.
[33:47.060 --> 33:47.500]  Okay.
[33:48.260 --> 33:50.120]  Loadouts are a place you can... okay.
[33:51.280 --> 33:52.060]  Do we keep going?
[33:52.740 --> 33:54.000]  Yeah, let's do another one.
[33:54.460 --> 33:57.740]  That's cool how everyone can do everyone's job, just really dog shit.
[33:58.280 --> 33:58.580]  Yeah.
[34:00.260 --> 34:01.140]  I'm clicking ready.
[34:01.900 --> 34:02.740]  Yeah, I'm just clicking ready.
[34:02.960 --> 34:03.380]  See what happens.
[34:03.640 --> 34:04.600]  You're a fixman again.
[34:05.480 --> 34:06.160]  God damn it.
[34:09.220 --> 34:09.960]  Just in time.
[34:10.020 --> 34:10.820]  I got double fixers.
[34:11.780 --> 34:12.760]  No, I think I switched.
[34:13.520 --> 34:13.740]  Yeah.
[34:14.160 --> 34:14.600]  Nice.
[34:15.660 --> 34:16.760]  Corrupted item spotted.
[34:18.300 --> 34:20.380]  Oh, it's going to mess with the gameplay.
[34:22.340 --> 34:22.780]  Interesting.
[34:29.350 --> 34:30.710]  Is this the same one we just did?
[34:31.090 --> 34:33.810]  I guess it's the same mission, but I think it might be more difficult.
[34:34.790 --> 34:35.010]  Okay.
[34:38.530 --> 34:40.150]  Neutralize Jasper post box.
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.000]  I feel like I'm shooting water way faster this time.
[34:48.180 --> 34:49.780]  I'm going in to fix this fan.
[34:50.160 --> 34:50.560]  All right.
[34:50.580 --> 34:51.580]  Gavin got the other one.
[34:53.900 --> 34:54.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.620]  I'm sitting there mashing away, like hitting quick type of it after quick type of it.
[35:00.720 --> 35:01.720]  Then you just show up and go pop.
[35:03.040 --> 35:03.900]  Okay, we got a bunch more.
[35:11.470 --> 35:12.890]  Got me in a corner.
[35:16.050 --> 35:18.870]  Yeah, I guess like look for more of those sealed doors and whatever.
[35:20.010 --> 35:20.770]  Neutralize Jasper.
[35:20.950 --> 35:22.350]  Gav, you want to...
[35:22.350 --> 35:22.730]  Quack.
[35:22.810 --> 35:23.370]  Yeah, there you go.
[35:23.650 --> 35:24.130]  I can't forget.
[35:24.250 --> 35:24.710]  Oh, shelter.
[35:27.070 --> 35:28.790]  So I guess I did open that door last time.
[35:29.570 --> 35:30.570]  I'm going to open this one.
[35:31.730 --> 35:32.410]  Get this going.
[35:33.850 --> 35:35.010]  All right, that was spawning a bunch.
[35:35.690 --> 35:35.890]  Yeah.
[35:36.450 --> 35:37.090]  How did I...
[35:38.370 --> 35:39.310]  I'm getting cold.
[35:42.310 --> 35:43.050]  Oh, I'm cold.
[35:43.350 --> 35:44.140]  Oh, we got a...
[35:44.140 --> 35:48.080]  We got one of those shrapnel guns on the floor.
[35:50.700 --> 35:52.120]  How do we stop freezing?
[35:52.300 --> 35:53.140]  Anybody else want to use it or...
[35:55.380 --> 35:56.060]  I'm good.
[35:56.620 --> 35:59.280]  I think we got to neutralize the Jasper post box somehow.
[36:01.220 --> 36:01.420]  Okay.
[36:01.820 --> 36:03.040]  Because I'm freezing up.
[36:06.020 --> 36:07.400]  Do I need to stand by the fire?
[36:08.400 --> 36:08.880]  Maybe.
[36:10.120 --> 36:10.880]  Yeah, it's chilly.
[36:11.160 --> 36:11.560]  Chilly Willy.
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.660]  See if we can find this object of power that's fucking...
[36:21.430 --> 36:23.570]  Yeah, I'm about to just be solid ice, I think.
[36:24.590 --> 36:25.430]  I'm so slow.
[36:26.250 --> 36:26.730]  Oh, yeah.
[36:27.030 --> 36:28.070]  Why are you putting out the fire?
[36:28.950 --> 36:29.270]  Sorry.
[36:30.110 --> 36:30.750]  It's instinctual.
[36:32.690 --> 36:34.230]  Guys, you can heat up over here at the fire.
[36:34.770 --> 36:35.330]  Oh, that's nice.
[36:38.810 --> 36:39.670]  Oh, guys, I'm hot.
[36:39.790 --> 36:40.130]  I'm hot.
[36:40.190 --> 36:40.430]  I'm hot.
[36:40.510 --> 36:40.810]  I'm hot.
[36:41.370 --> 36:42.150]  It's too hot.
[36:45.470 --> 36:46.570]  Where's the frickin' item?
[36:49.410 --> 36:50.310]  Preparing this thing.
[36:51.210 --> 36:52.990]  I'm too hot and too cold.
[36:53.110 --> 36:53.530]  I'm dying.
[36:54.490 --> 36:55.190]  Could you shoot me, Andrew?
[36:55.810 --> 36:56.750]  Yeah, one sec.
[36:59.570 --> 37:01.590]  Oh, yeah, you're straight up in flame.
[37:02.470 --> 37:04.730]  Yeah, I had to get close to fire to unfreeze.
[37:04.750 --> 37:06.070]  Okay, we got a bunch of guys running on the right.
[37:06.210 --> 37:07.790]  I'm working on them, but there's a lot.
[37:09.470 --> 37:10.330]  We need some water.
[37:16.830 --> 37:20.490]  I'm gonna go open the thing down here.
[37:20.650 --> 37:21.690]  It'll spawn more guys.
[37:24.670 --> 37:25.650]  Oh, I found the mailbox.
[37:27.890 --> 37:28.630]  What do we do with it?
[37:28.710 --> 37:29.370]  How do I get rid of this thing?
[37:32.350 --> 37:34.530]  Do you have any creepy post we could put in?
[37:35.890 --> 37:36.490]  Uh-huh.
[37:38.990 --> 37:40.370]  Maybe a grenade or something.
[37:40.490 --> 37:41.950]  Here, I'm gonna try throwing a grenade at it.
[37:42.250 --> 37:42.590]  Go for it.
[37:43.670 --> 37:44.910]  Doesn't seem like it did anything.
[37:45.330 --> 37:46.590]  How do we neutralize?
[37:47.390 --> 37:47.790]  Fuck.
[37:48.550 --> 37:51.170]  I mean, at the moment, it's kind of handy for keeping us cool.
[37:57.520 --> 37:58.860]  Do we still have the shrapnel gun?
[37:59.920 --> 38:01.460]  Uh, I left it out there, I think.
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.580]  Oh, maybe we try using that on it?
[38:10.180 --> 38:11.600]  Neutralize Jasper Postbox.
[38:12.080 --> 38:14.980]  Okay, I'm gonna go grab that shrapnel gun and see if that does anything good.
[38:16.180 --> 38:17.020]  Oh, it's Hitman.
[38:17.480 --> 38:19.060]  Oh, tons of guys coming in.
[38:19.660 --> 38:20.020]  Yeah.
[38:20.020 --> 38:26.140]  Can I fuck with this thing?
[38:28.520 --> 38:28.820]  Yeah.
[38:29.600 --> 38:30.000]  Wow.
[38:30.660 --> 38:31.500]  Shredder gets rid of it.
[38:32.220 --> 38:33.820]  How did you figure that out?
[38:34.880 --> 38:36.900]  I mean, it's just nothing else was working.
[38:37.980 --> 38:40.280]  I don't think I would have even bothered trying that.
[38:40.500 --> 38:41.660]  Same. Wouldn't even cross my mind.
[38:43.680 --> 38:44.080]  Shredder.
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.160]  And let's get these fans going.
[38:48.460 --> 38:50.560]  Oh, there's a charge thing here. What is this? Oh, it's the shower.
[38:51.220 --> 38:51.580]  Okay.
[38:52.500 --> 38:54.060]  I'm gonna start repairing this.
[38:54.400 --> 38:55.400]  I'm gonna have a little shower here.
[38:56.680 --> 38:57.220]  Oh, yeah.
[39:03.160 --> 39:04.120]  What was that?
[39:04.380 --> 39:07.320]  That was me electrocuting myself by failing on the quick time.
[39:10.280 --> 39:11.380]  You doing a wrench job?
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.780]  I'm just going by hand.
[39:15.180 --> 39:15.980]  Being slow.
[39:17.060 --> 39:18.340]  Yeah, I mean, is it a...
[39:18.340 --> 39:20.000]  Oh, yeah, but it is a wrench job, yeah.
[39:24.480 --> 39:25.820]  Alright, we gotta get to the next zone.
[39:27.680 --> 39:29.780]  Maybe Geoffrey Dean Morgan told us to.
[39:31.960 --> 39:32.760]  It's his central.
[39:33.920 --> 39:35.060]  Ton spawning in.
[39:36.520 --> 39:37.480]  I'm just waiting at the door.
[39:37.900 --> 39:38.860]  You guys want to sprint over here?
[39:39.360 --> 39:39.680]  Coming over.
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.540]  Headed your way.
[39:43.020 --> 39:43.900]  Nope, in the bathroom.
[39:45.960 --> 39:46.600]  The hell is this?
[39:47.720 --> 39:48.360]  Okay, more his.
[39:50.820 --> 39:52.120]  Neutralized gas cylinder?
[39:52.120 --> 39:53.380]  Oh, watch out!
[39:53.660 --> 39:54.000]  The flames!
[39:57.640 --> 39:58.320]  I'm down.
[40:02.330 --> 40:03.670]  Shooting water to you guys.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.040]  Did you get up, Geoff?
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.220]  Yeah, I'm up.
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.740]  Oh, shit.
[40:14.500 --> 40:17.860]  They're exploding corpses until we destroy the gas cylinder thing.
[40:18.640 --> 40:19.600]  Let's try to find it.
[40:20.500 --> 40:21.280]  It's over here.
[40:22.280 --> 40:22.680]  What is this?
[40:23.180 --> 40:23.580]  You found it?
[40:23.760 --> 40:24.960]  Oh, I found a gas cylinder.
[40:25.680 --> 40:26.940]  Oh, nice, Geoff.
[40:29.040 --> 40:29.620]  Got it.
[40:30.100 --> 40:30.880]  Good find.
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.820]  I'm gonna try to keep ammo for that thing because it seems like every room has one of those fucked up objects.
[40:38.860 --> 40:39.500]  You gotta do your repair.
[40:44.540 --> 40:45.340]  Thank you.
[40:47.960 --> 40:49.120]  We got more coming in.
[40:50.900 --> 40:54.300]  I think it's sort of Left 4 Dead-ish in the sense of like we want to be fast.
[40:54.300 --> 40:56.960]  It feels like the longer we stay, the more they spawn.
[40:57.640 --> 40:58.380]  Don't hang about.
[40:58.820 --> 40:59.120]  Yeah.
[41:00.280 --> 41:01.520]  Alright, I got ammo up.
[41:01.780 --> 41:06.560]  You probably will when you still have your repair and shit.
[41:15.690 --> 41:20.570]  Oh, that doesn't sound good.
[41:21.570 --> 41:22.890]  That really doesn't sound good.
[41:24.570 --> 41:26.550]  Alright, remember to stick together for shield.
[41:26.550 --> 41:27.230]  Shield.
[41:27.910 --> 41:28.750]  Great point.
[41:35.950 --> 41:36.730]  There it is.
[41:40.170 --> 41:41.010]  Oh, boy.
[41:42.150 --> 41:43.310]  Oh, they're spawning on me.
[41:44.230 --> 41:45.590]  Oh, they're running towards you, too.
[41:46.890 --> 41:47.850]  Trying to sync up.
[41:48.050 --> 41:48.310]  Oh, no.
[41:48.630 --> 41:49.130]  Last hole.
[41:49.610 --> 41:49.950]  Oh, no.
[41:53.850 --> 41:55.150]  I'm gonna go down in the...
[41:55.150 --> 41:55.470]  I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[41:55.790 --> 41:56.950]  I'm gonna go down in the...
[41:58.450 --> 41:59.430]  Are we stood in fire?
[41:59.630 --> 42:00.230]  I think we are.
[42:00.670 --> 42:01.550]  Here, I got it.
[42:02.090 --> 42:02.510]  Thank you.
[42:03.590 --> 42:04.350]  Double water!
[42:05.050 --> 42:06.050]  The shower was on fire.
[42:10.470 --> 42:11.270]  Oh, health.
[42:14.470 --> 42:18.250]  If this is how it worked in the bath, I would never be below a thousand percent.
[42:18.550 --> 42:20.550]  I would just be unstoppable.
[42:21.250 --> 42:22.450]  You would have like iron ankles.
[42:23.050 --> 42:23.370]  I would.
[42:24.470 --> 42:26.150]  Yeah, I'm gonna go in and fix this fan.
[42:26.910 --> 42:28.390]  Still have six more of these things?
[42:28.610 --> 42:28.770]  Fuck.
[42:29.150 --> 42:29.830]  Oh, there's another one.
[42:29.930 --> 42:31.110]  There's a shrapnel gun.
[42:32.490 --> 42:34.950]  Oh, yeah, we should definitely keep that with us.
[42:35.230 --> 42:38.650]  I've just been grabbing it and then dropping it whenever I need to.
[42:38.830 --> 42:39.490]  Oh, Jesus.
[42:40.790 --> 42:43.150]  Slimey, uh, frickin' weird...
[42:43.710 --> 42:44.110]  What?
[42:45.010 --> 42:47.490]  Like, floppy head, like the flood or something.
[42:47.630 --> 42:49.370]  Use that fucking gun, dude.
[42:49.970 --> 42:51.490]  Use that shrapnel gun on these assholes.
[42:52.170 --> 42:54.490]  Also, shoot the red things on their backs, I assume.
[42:54.490 --> 42:54.690]  They got pustules.
[42:56.390 --> 42:57.490]  They're people pustules.
[42:57.930 --> 42:58.890]  Yeah, they're people pustules.
[43:01.470 --> 43:05.250]  Okay, well, I just used all the shredder ammo on mine, so if we can try to keep...
[43:05.630 --> 43:07.270]  Oh, shit, I see what you're talking about.
[43:07.430 --> 43:07.510]  Yeah.
[43:07.570 --> 43:08.110]  Oh, my God.
[43:08.390 --> 43:10.110]  The bad thing...
[43:14.090 --> 43:15.430]  Looks like one's down.
[43:16.850 --> 43:17.250]  Fuck.
[43:18.310 --> 43:18.710]  Yeah.
[43:21.550 --> 43:21.950]  Ow.
[43:23.350 --> 43:24.390]  Alright, the other one's down.
[43:24.990 --> 43:25.770]  Okay, both down.
[43:25.770 --> 43:28.150]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[43:30.110 --> 43:31.310]  Oh, I'm getting hot.
[43:32.250 --> 43:35.230]  I don't know if we ever cleared out this room.
[43:36.190 --> 43:36.510]  We did not.
[43:36.670 --> 43:37.410]  I'll take the shredder.
[43:41.940 --> 43:43.040]  Get that nice ammo.
[43:43.080 --> 43:44.300]  Oh, there's two shredder guns in here.
[43:45.520 --> 43:46.640]  That's a scary sign.
[43:48.100 --> 43:50.120]  Uh, three shredder guns are in here.
[43:50.660 --> 43:51.940]  We should definitely bring these with us.
[43:55.060 --> 43:56.100]  What does it replace?
[43:56.120 --> 43:57.040]  Does it replace my main gun?
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.060]  No, you just hold it and you can drop it like a heavy inhaler.
[44:00.300 --> 44:00.940]  Oh, that's great.
[44:01.360 --> 44:02.080]  Love that.
[44:07.680 --> 44:08.160]  Okay.
[44:08.940 --> 44:09.540]  Move out.
[44:10.700 --> 44:12.260]  Such a great use of shrapnel.
[44:12.740 --> 44:13.060]  Mm-hmm.
[44:14.120 --> 44:15.020]  It's a cool weapon design.
[44:16.440 --> 44:17.780]  Gonna get another repair over here.
[44:19.380 --> 44:19.820]  Wrench job?
[44:20.840 --> 44:21.300]  Shot it.
[44:21.560 --> 44:22.560]  Wrench job.
[44:27.110 --> 44:28.510]  More wrench in the fan.
[44:35.750 --> 44:37.290]  Ow, ow, ow.
[44:37.410 --> 44:37.870]  Are you okay?
[44:38.270 --> 44:39.630]  Fire put out over here.
[44:40.110 --> 44:41.150]  Here, here, here, here.
[44:41.570 --> 44:42.510]  I was getting all gubbed up.
[44:43.430 --> 44:43.730]  Thank you.
[44:43.890 --> 44:45.070]  You're getting stuck in the blades.
[44:45.550 --> 44:45.770]  Yeah.
[44:45.950 --> 44:48.550]  Got four more.
[44:49.570 --> 44:50.290]  Andrew, I'm hot.
[44:50.550 --> 44:51.330]  Oh, shit. Sorry.
[44:51.790 --> 44:52.330]  Here we go.
[44:53.030 --> 44:53.250]  Thank you.
[44:54.710 --> 44:56.410]  We got a charge job on this car.
[44:58.470 --> 44:58.870]  Nice.
[44:59.850 --> 45:00.410]  Job, Jack.
[45:03.570 --> 45:05.450]  This is like the ultimate teamwork game.
[45:05.890 --> 45:06.290]  Yeah.
[45:06.290 --> 45:08.050]  Yeah, and we're the ultimate team.
[45:09.010 --> 45:10.870]  That should be our show name.
[45:11.670 --> 45:12.850]  The ultimate team.
[45:13.010 --> 45:13.730]  Team ultimate.
[45:15.030 --> 45:15.330]  Tut.
[45:16.330 --> 45:20.430]  That'd be cool if there was like an ultimate, like a shared super.
[45:21.330 --> 45:22.330]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[45:22.970 --> 45:25.270]  Oh, Geoff, there's a bunch of charge jobs up here for you.
[45:25.370 --> 45:25.950]  All right, I'm right here.
[45:32.820 --> 45:33.980]  Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
[45:34.020 --> 45:34.880]  Oh, we got hiss.
[45:34.980 --> 45:35.400]  We got hiss.
[45:35.400 --> 45:36.400]  Sounds like...
[45:38.860 --> 45:39.080]  Oh, shit.
[45:39.300 --> 45:40.200]  Oh, fuck. Fire, fire.
[45:41.060 --> 45:42.480]  Water, water, water, water, water.
[45:44.140 --> 45:45.480]  Oh, my health is real low.
[45:45.520 --> 45:48.240]  If we can find a shower, that would be amazing.
[45:49.780 --> 45:51.320]  I'm loving all this lecky damage.
[45:51.740 --> 45:52.840]  Oh, nice.
[45:54.840 --> 45:55.760]  A little lecky.
[46:00.460 --> 46:01.340]  Okay, just two more.
[46:03.880 --> 46:05.700]  What's the story of the zombie guys?
[46:06.300 --> 46:07.120]  Like, are they people?
[46:08.780 --> 46:10.340]  Yeah, but the hiss is usually like...
[46:13.780 --> 46:14.820]  Possessed people.
[46:15.540 --> 46:17.280]  Oh, we gotta get Amber Johnson.
[46:18.080 --> 46:18.680]  Grenade out.
[46:22.450 --> 46:23.350]  Holy shit.
[46:25.110 --> 46:26.910]  Yeah, I guess it was a woman called Amber.
[46:28.970 --> 46:29.390]  Good kill.
[46:31.030 --> 46:31.870]  I'm so weak.
[46:35.090 --> 46:35.930]  All right, it's clear.
[46:36.870 --> 46:37.730]  A little bit more.
[46:38.010 --> 46:38.570]  Okay, got him.
[46:45.070 --> 46:46.430]  Get all the boulders and stuff.
[46:46.630 --> 46:46.870]  Nice.
[46:47.350 --> 46:48.350]  Let's get Andrew in a shower.
[46:48.750 --> 46:49.050]  Yeah.
[46:49.170 --> 46:49.810]  Looking for one.
[46:50.070 --> 46:50.650]  There's one over here.
[46:51.890 --> 46:52.590]  Going to you, Gavin.
[46:52.790 --> 46:53.430]  Thank you.
[46:54.390 --> 46:54.890]  Good ping.
[46:57.090 --> 46:58.070]  What's the ping button again?
[46:58.290 --> 46:58.590]  Down.
[46:59.370 --> 46:59.690]  D-pad.
[47:00.330 --> 47:01.490]  Down, down, down, down.
[47:02.430 --> 47:04.110]  Group shower, group shower, group shower.
[47:07.770 --> 47:09.130]  Oh, that's nice.
[47:10.130 --> 47:11.330]  Okay, let's go to that fan.
[47:11.330 --> 47:13.450]  Back the way we came.
[47:16.190 --> 47:17.370]  Man, this is a good game.
[47:17.730 --> 47:18.830]  Shoot fire at us.
[47:19.010 --> 47:19.490]  Let's be careful.
[47:19.590 --> 47:19.890]  Oh, yeah.
[47:19.930 --> 47:21.590]  It looks like it's kind of triggering.
[47:28.140 --> 47:28.540]  Yeah.
[47:28.820 --> 47:29.120]  Ah!
[47:30.280 --> 47:30.680]  Oh!
[47:31.260 --> 47:31.560]  Oh!
[47:31.880 --> 47:32.520]  Water, water.
[47:32.620 --> 47:32.900]  Shit!
[47:33.100 --> 47:33.440]  I'm going down!
[47:33.740 --> 47:34.180]  Water, water, water.
[47:34.820 --> 47:35.440]  Hot, hot, hot.
[47:37.540 --> 47:38.420]  Picking Gavin up.
[47:39.400 --> 47:40.180]  I'm working on them.
[47:40.440 --> 47:40.960]  You get him.
[47:41.480 --> 47:41.840]  Thank you.
[47:42.480 --> 47:43.520]  How did only I go down?
[47:45.480 --> 47:46.600]  Why did only you go down?
[47:46.840 --> 47:47.400]  Is that what you said?
[47:47.640 --> 47:49.440]  Because you ate all of the flames.
[47:50.200 --> 47:50.620]  We were in cover.
[47:50.620 --> 47:51.540]  I just thought I was right next to you.
[47:51.740 --> 47:52.260]  You're a flame eater.
[47:56.120 --> 47:56.840]  Nice repair.
[47:57.320 --> 47:58.020]  We got one more.
[47:58.720 --> 47:59.500]  I gotta go back to the...
[48:00.360 --> 48:00.660]  Yeah.
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.500]  I think I might peel off since it's right next to us and just try to quickly knock this out while you do that.
[48:07.020 --> 48:07.680]  I don't really need it.
[48:11.160 --> 48:12.620]  I'm going to try and get more grenades in this.
[48:12.620 --> 48:13.940]  I say that when I hear every fucking hiss in the world.
[48:14.640 --> 48:16.620]  Well, I put a shell at door because I'm out of grenades.
[48:16.620 --> 48:17.360]  Okay.
[48:20.480 --> 48:21.800]  Did I pick up a briefcase?
[48:22.020 --> 48:22.880]  Is that just a lot of folder?
[48:24.360 --> 48:25.020]  Yeah, I think so.
[48:27.720 --> 48:28.480]  I'm cold.
[48:32.980 --> 48:34.420]  Opening the next zone.
[48:34.620 --> 48:35.800]  I found a research sample.
[48:35.960 --> 48:38.940]  This is a valuable resource used to purchase and upgrade perks between matches.
[48:39.620 --> 48:40.000]  Oh shit.
[48:40.420 --> 48:42.100]  We got a rogue table saw.
[48:42.340 --> 48:44.340]  Oh guys, there's a lot of assholes on me.
[48:46.540 --> 48:48.240]  I got so turned around.
[48:50.300 --> 48:50.880]  You know what?
[48:51.640 --> 48:53.040]  Other than I'm getting kind of hot.
[48:53.220 --> 48:53.740]  Hot, hot, hot.
[48:53.800 --> 48:54.940]  Oh no, I turned around.
[48:55.100 --> 48:55.780]  I'm not okay.
[48:56.140 --> 48:56.580]  Turn around, Geoff.
[48:59.700 --> 49:01.020]  We can do some more, Andrew.
[49:01.460 --> 49:02.200]  Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[49:03.380 --> 49:03.640]  Hot!
[49:06.880 --> 49:07.880]  Geoff's going to go down.
[49:08.140 --> 49:08.740]  Everyone's down.
[49:09.760 --> 49:10.300]  Fuck, okay.
[49:11.780 --> 49:12.660]  One sec, sorry.
[49:13.220 --> 49:15.040]  I'm going to clear it and then I'll...
[49:17.380 --> 49:18.040]  Why are you...
[49:19.040 --> 49:20.260]  Let me drop this gun.
[49:22.900 --> 49:23.380]  Okay.
[49:24.060 --> 49:25.600]  Hurry, there's a juggernaut guy.
[49:26.860 --> 49:27.440]  Get someone up.
[49:29.240 --> 49:29.960]  That's me.
[49:31.720 --> 49:32.840]  Focus on the juggernaut.
[49:33.000 --> 49:33.580]  I'm getting him.
[49:33.880 --> 49:35.120]  It's cooling down, everybody.
[49:36.460 --> 49:37.100]  Juggernaut's down.
[49:37.680 --> 49:38.520]  Okay, get Geoff.
[49:40.040 --> 49:40.960]  Patting his butt.
[49:41.540 --> 49:42.560]  Okay, table saw.
[49:42.720 --> 49:43.680]  Look out for a table saw.
[49:44.160 --> 49:44.300]  Yeah.
[49:49.420 --> 49:50.720]  Oh, this room again.
[49:52.380 --> 49:53.260]  Oh, it's coming.
[49:54.660 --> 49:55.720]  Getting covered, getting covered.
[50:00.190 --> 50:01.710]  Where's this fucking table saw?
[50:02.430 --> 50:03.130]  Where you at?
[50:05.030 --> 50:06.790]  Wow, the chair people just got cooked.
[50:08.110 --> 50:08.690]  I'm down too.
[50:08.910 --> 50:09.270]  Oh, shit.
[50:09.870 --> 50:10.970]  I thought I was undercover, but...
[50:10.970 --> 50:11.770]  Oh, maybe because I was shooting them.
[50:11.850 --> 50:13.730]  Andrew, you want to work on barrels while I get Geoff's ass?
[50:13.890 --> 50:14.470]  Sure, sure, sure.
[50:15.070 --> 50:16.930]  I'm up in...
[50:16.930 --> 50:18.970]  Yeah, my butt was in pretty good shape, thank you.
[50:21.530 --> 50:22.090]  I'm in.
[50:22.390 --> 50:23.450]  Oh, juggernaut coming down.
[50:24.990 --> 50:26.150]  Oh, taking care of him.
[50:28.730 --> 50:30.250]  Be on the lookout for table saws still.
[50:30.390 --> 50:30.510]  He's down.
[50:31.590 --> 50:33.250]  Oh, I'm hot, I'm burning up.
[50:34.070 --> 50:34.470]  I'm hot.
[50:34.590 --> 50:35.430]  Oh, god, Andrew.
[50:35.790 --> 50:36.070]  I'm hot.
[50:36.550 --> 50:37.350]  Get over to me.
[50:38.810 --> 50:39.650]  Oh, I'm hot as shit.
[50:42.210 --> 50:42.430]  Thank you.
[50:42.550 --> 50:44.230]  Oh, shit, if I hold left trigger, that's how I crank?
[50:44.370 --> 50:44.610]  Okay.
[50:45.610 --> 50:45.930]  Cool.
[50:49.810 --> 50:50.450]  Okay, uh...
[50:51.170 --> 50:53.090]  Jesus, we need 15 this time.
[50:54.470 --> 50:57.310]  I might leave and go heal and come back.
[50:57.770 --> 50:59.590]  Uh, there might be a shower in here.
[51:00.650 --> 51:03.610]  Yeah, is this a shower? What is this? Or is this like where a shower can spawn?
[51:05.910 --> 51:06.570]  Oh, I'm down.
[51:09.010 --> 51:09.750]  Trying to get you.
[51:10.810 --> 51:12.370]  Man, having a pistol kinda sucks.
[51:12.810 --> 51:13.190]  I went down.
[51:14.410 --> 51:14.930]  Oh, boy.
[51:18.190 --> 51:19.530]  How do you like your shotgun, Gav?
[51:20.010 --> 51:20.430]  Love it.
[51:20.530 --> 51:20.810]  I'm down.
[51:20.830 --> 51:21.230]  Andrew's down.
[51:21.890 --> 51:22.570]  Yeah, we're gonna have to...
[51:22.570 --> 51:23.650]  Uh, why don't...
[51:24.750 --> 51:25.470]  I redeployed.
[51:25.470 --> 51:25.730]  Okay.
[51:27.430 --> 51:28.970]  Should I just try and run over there?
[51:29.130 --> 51:29.250]  Yeah.
[51:29.350 --> 51:29.510]  Yeah.
[51:33.720 --> 51:35.160]  We need so many barrels.
[51:36.700 --> 51:37.320]  What is that?
[51:37.340 --> 51:39.340]  I don't know how many we have charging currently, but...
[51:39.340 --> 51:41.640]  I think I sent one off already, so...
[51:41.640 --> 51:41.880]  Okay.
[51:43.960 --> 51:47.260]  I wonder if the hacksaw's in like the middle area and that's why we're not seeing...
[51:47.260 --> 51:48.120]  Oh, Gavin, be careful.
[51:48.840 --> 51:49.060]  Shit.
[51:50.020 --> 51:50.380]  Shit.
[51:51.620 --> 51:52.340]  Nice job.
[51:53.300 --> 51:55.240]  Get Andrew first, cause he can...
[51:55.240 --> 51:57.320]  Can you spray me while I'm getting Geoff up?
[51:57.380 --> 51:58.280]  Yeah, as soon as I get up.
[51:58.520 --> 51:59.540]  Oh, you got Geoff up first.
[51:59.700 --> 52:00.080]  Shit, I got Geoff.
[52:00.200 --> 52:01.020]  Oh, shit.
[52:01.780 --> 52:02.640]  Now, that's a barrel.
[52:04.340 --> 52:05.700]  I'm patting Andrew's butt.
[52:06.380 --> 52:06.540]  Thank you.
[52:06.540 --> 52:07.680]  Oh, I might go down before you're up.
[52:08.620 --> 52:09.420]  Spray! Spray!
[52:09.780 --> 52:10.480]  Thank you.
[52:10.960 --> 52:11.140]  Woo!
[52:13.280 --> 52:13.800]  Spray it.
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.520]  These are all our books that fell.
[52:18.180 --> 52:18.360]  Yeah.
[52:22.730 --> 52:24.990]  Hey, we got more hiss. I'm so low on ammo.
[52:25.110 --> 52:25.990]  I'm out of ammo.
[52:29.510 --> 52:31.170]  Uh, where's the fucking ammo?
[52:33.310 --> 52:35.990]  I'm gonna start sending some of these barrels across.
[52:37.430 --> 52:38.210]  About to send one.
[52:40.250 --> 52:42.830]  Luckily, some of them are already full, so you can just...
[52:46.150 --> 52:46.550]  One...
[52:49.300 --> 52:50.440]  What's going on over here?
[52:50.980 --> 52:52.220]  You said you're out of ammo, Andrew?
[52:52.420 --> 52:52.680]  Yeah.
[52:53.320 --> 52:54.900]  I think there might be some below us.
[52:55.060 --> 52:56.280]  Let me go see if I can turn it on.
[52:57.820 --> 52:59.020]  Found another folder.
[52:59.900 --> 53:01.660]  Yeah, I got ammo right here.
[53:03.100 --> 53:03.720]  Okay, going to you.
[53:04.800 --> 53:08.500]  I found the thing. I'm gonna destroy the...
[53:08.500 --> 53:10.940]  Ah, shit! I went down completely in the open.
[53:13.380 --> 53:16.240]  I'll come to you in just a second. I gotta heal up. Just a second.
[53:16.980 --> 53:17.920]  Working my way to Gavin.
[53:18.420 --> 53:19.740]  I killed these guys real fast.
[53:20.100 --> 53:21.320]  The chair guy throwing shit.
[53:22.660 --> 53:24.460]  Alright, killing the chair guy.
[53:25.480 --> 53:26.560]  Okay, Gavin's about to go up.
[53:27.140 --> 53:27.360]  Thank you.
[53:29.240 --> 53:30.060]  What is that?
[53:31.120 --> 53:33.280]  Alright, I got the shower repaired.
[53:33.600 --> 53:35.480]  I'm still out of ammo. Where's the...
[53:35.480 --> 53:36.960]  I think I just killed the table saw.
[53:37.680 --> 53:38.480]  No, still.
[53:38.800 --> 53:39.020]  No.
[53:40.220 --> 53:42.880]  Do you have the crank, though? Okay, here we go.
[53:43.800 --> 53:44.420]  Andrew, I'm hot.
[53:45.500 --> 53:46.000]  Coming to you.
[53:47.360 --> 53:47.780]  Thank you.
[53:47.960 --> 53:48.620]  Geoff, get out of the way.
[53:50.500 --> 53:51.760]  I'm out of the way. I'm in the little room.
[53:52.860 --> 53:53.880]  Juggernaut! Juggernaut!
[53:54.040 --> 53:54.340]  Gavin!
[53:54.780 --> 53:55.840]  Oh, shit! Postulman!
[53:57.440 --> 53:59.100]  Oh, I think the furnace killed him.
[53:59.500 --> 54:02.220]  Fuck! That was me. I downed myself with the grenade.
[54:04.300 --> 54:04.940]  Great grenade.
[54:06.340 --> 54:08.000]  Oh, yeah. Vaporized me.
[54:08.220 --> 54:09.320]  Oh, we got more chair people.
[54:12.660 --> 54:15.800]  Is there one of those bunkers we can open down here? Oh, yeah.
[54:15.880 --> 54:17.740]  I'm in the bunker. I was just in the bunker hanging out.
[54:17.940 --> 54:18.260]  Do we have a shredder?
[54:18.260 --> 54:19.020]  Are you just hanging out in a bunker?
[54:20.240 --> 54:20.900]  What did you say, Geoff?
[54:22.360 --> 54:26.260]  I turned the shower on and the ammo downstairs.
[54:26.600 --> 54:27.540]  Just hang down.
[54:27.560 --> 54:28.860]  I'm going for the object of power.
[54:29.620 --> 54:31.200]  I'm gonna go and suck on tap.
[54:32.020 --> 54:32.540]  There we go.
[54:34.040 --> 54:34.960]  Grab that barrel.
[54:37.220 --> 54:38.720]  What was the table saw?
[54:39.140 --> 54:40.100]  What was the saw doing?
[54:40.420 --> 54:42.240]  It said lowering our shields.
[54:43.640 --> 54:45.260]  Did you find anything good in here?
[54:46.400 --> 54:47.320]  Yeah, I found grenades.
[54:48.220 --> 54:50.180]  I didn't do all that thorough search on that side.
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.260]  Oh, it's getting hot.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.360]  Oh, we gotta charge these things.
[54:57.100 --> 55:01.840]  They're not charging up because we need to recharge the machines.
[55:02.460 --> 55:03.240]  Whose job is that?
[55:04.020 --> 55:07.100]  That's probably me. Let me do that in a second. Let me just kill these guys.
[55:08.200 --> 55:10.520]  I got the one up on the left. We got more barrels going.
[55:14.120 --> 55:15.520]  We need to go over and stop.
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.460]  Yeah, I'm gonna run over really quickly and just kind of take a peek at what's going on.
[55:21.640 --> 55:23.660]  It looks like they're going.
[55:25.180 --> 55:30.120]  Where do you charge this up?
[55:31.440 --> 55:32.020]  What do you mean?
[55:33.060 --> 55:34.960]  Well, you said we have to recharge the...
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.140]  Yeah, it's here. I'll show you.
[55:36.380 --> 55:36.760]  Flare!
[55:37.260 --> 55:37.740]  Flare!
[55:38.800 --> 55:39.460]  Getting hot.
[55:40.860 --> 55:42.360]  I'm gonna stay over here until after the flare.
[55:43.640 --> 55:45.340]  It looks like these guys are done.
[55:50.430 --> 55:51.210]  Coming back.
[55:51.390 --> 55:52.190]  We got more spawning in.
[55:54.730 --> 55:57.250]  This thing will turn off, Geoff, when it needs repaired.
[55:57.850 --> 55:59.510]  The green thing that's next to it.
[56:00.190 --> 56:02.370]  Okay, and is that me or Gavin that fixes it?
[56:03.330 --> 56:04.030]  I don't know.
[56:08.190 --> 56:08.550]  Heavy.
[56:09.170 --> 56:10.170]  Yeah, we got two heavies.
[56:11.990 --> 56:12.830]  And one's down.
[56:17.590 --> 56:19.990]  Do you happen to do a barrel count when you're over there, Gavin?
[56:21.170 --> 56:22.370]  All I do is send one in.
[56:23.790 --> 56:24.450]  I'll run over.
[56:26.470 --> 56:27.670]  How many do we need? 15?
[56:28.270 --> 56:29.010]  We're at 14 now.
[56:31.590 --> 56:32.430]  We have...
[56:32.430 --> 56:33.430]  Oh, it's getting hot.
[56:36.550 --> 56:37.390]  2, 3...
[56:37.390 --> 56:40.650]  2, 3...
[56:41.210 --> 56:42.670]  4, it looks like 5.
[56:42.670 --> 56:43.790]  It's hard to tell how many are here.
[56:45.110 --> 56:45.750]  I'm fucked.
[56:47.430 --> 56:47.890]  I'm dying.
[56:48.210 --> 56:49.230]  I gotta get to the...
[56:54.830 --> 56:56.830]  It's hard to tell because they're kind of on top of each other.
[56:56.930 --> 56:57.190]  Okay.
[56:57.550 --> 57:00.610]  On the right, but it looks like we have at least 7 or 8.
[57:00.970 --> 57:03.450]  Yeah, I'm gonna put some more on either side.
[57:04.950 --> 57:05.030]  Yeah.
[57:09.970 --> 57:10.750]  Ooh, it's hot.
[57:16.810 --> 57:17.410]  Flare coming.
[57:21.630 --> 57:22.450]  Assholes in the sky.
[57:22.710 --> 57:22.890]  Yeah.
[57:23.110 --> 57:24.390]  Hide, hide.
[57:27.270 --> 57:27.670]  Oh, no.
[57:28.590 --> 57:29.790]  I'm probably gonna go down.
[57:30.990 --> 57:31.190]  Okay.
[57:31.950 --> 57:32.770]  If I can get to the...
[57:36.170 --> 57:37.210]  Sending in another one.
[57:37.910 --> 57:38.310]  Nice.
[57:38.730 --> 57:39.730]  I'm right behind you.
[57:41.150 --> 57:42.230]  Sending in another one.
[57:43.650 --> 57:44.310]  Flare, flare.
[57:44.350 --> 57:44.810]  Oh, boy, I'm down.
[57:45.490 --> 57:46.070]  Oh, shit.
[57:46.290 --> 57:46.990]  Oh, I got your barrel, though.
[57:46.990 --> 57:47.350]  Thanks, Geoff.
[57:47.990 --> 57:48.250]  Yeah.
[57:49.130 --> 57:51.350]  Hey, Gavin, I'm just gonna blast this with water.
[57:51.990 --> 57:52.170]  Yep.
[57:53.430 --> 57:55.590]  I'm gonna chuck this in the furnace and then go for Geoff.
[57:56.050 --> 57:56.270]  Yeah.
[57:57.310 --> 57:58.310]  I can go for Geoff.
[57:58.990 --> 57:59.190]  Okay.
[57:59.270 --> 57:59.590]  You do that.
[58:03.170 --> 58:04.570]  I like this game.
[58:04.970 --> 58:05.710]  Yeah, this is fun.
[58:07.410 --> 58:09.270]  And we've only done one of the missions.
[58:10.090 --> 58:11.490]  This is what peak should be.
[58:12.110 --> 58:12.550]  Oh, no.
[58:13.050 --> 58:14.010]  I got a lot of bad shit.
[58:14.370 --> 58:15.410]  Flare, come on.
[58:16.110 --> 58:16.450]  Woo.
[58:16.690 --> 58:17.330]  Sorry, Geoff.
[58:17.490 --> 58:19.390]  I'm just gonna wait for this to pass.
[58:19.390 --> 58:20.110]  No, no worries, man.
[58:20.230 --> 58:20.750]  That's no worries.
[58:20.910 --> 58:21.030]  On you.
[58:21.190 --> 58:22.350]  Worst thing that happens, I die.
[58:22.730 --> 58:23.250]  That's true.
[58:23.350 --> 58:24.050]  We're still fucking alive.
[58:24.790 --> 58:25.490]  Oh, hey, Gavin.
[58:25.730 --> 58:25.770]  What's up?
[58:25.770 --> 58:27.650]  I didn't know you could go the other way with the zipline.
[58:28.370 --> 58:29.210]  Yeah, it's great.
[58:29.430 --> 58:29.890]  That's awesome.
[58:30.950 --> 58:31.110]  Okay.
[58:31.110 --> 58:31.310]  Thank you.
[58:31.590 --> 58:33.590]  I'm gonna go to get some health in the bunker, I think.
[58:34.470 --> 58:34.830]  Off.
[58:36.210 --> 58:37.310]  Don't forget there's a...
[58:38.530 --> 58:40.710]  There's a shower down there I turned on, too.
[58:41.050 --> 58:41.350]  Nice.
[58:41.830 --> 58:44.810]  Okay, I'm gonna load up some of these barrels and then make sure...
[58:44.810 --> 58:45.510]  You're facing the bunker.
[58:45.650 --> 58:46.630]  The shower's on the right.
[58:47.570 --> 58:49.550]  Just sent two barrels or a barrel off.
[58:49.690 --> 58:50.430]  Let's send another one.
[58:51.690 --> 58:52.050]  Sweet.
[58:52.170 --> 58:53.710]  Okay, we got one charging on this side.
[58:54.710 --> 58:58.570]  I guess let's start cashing out what we got and see if we need to charge more.
[58:58.730 --> 58:59.830]  We have quite a few over here still.
[59:00.570 --> 59:00.750]  Yeah.
[59:00.830 --> 59:02.170]  Okay, I'm gonna go over and keep putting stuff in.
[59:04.790 --> 59:07.750]  There's also a place to charge them over here, right?
[59:07.850 --> 59:09.110]  Is that what's on the side?
[59:09.270 --> 59:09.430]  Is there?
[59:10.730 --> 59:11.710]  I haven't noticed that.
[59:12.710 --> 59:14.750]  Look to the left of the left one.
[59:15.490 --> 59:15.990]  Okay, flare.
[59:19.090 --> 59:20.310]  See, like, this area here?
[59:21.270 --> 59:24.250]  I keep finding barrels, like, way in the bottom tucked away.
[59:24.630 --> 59:30.090]  Which makes me think maybe we're gonna need to hunt down barrels, you know?
[59:30.370 --> 59:30.610]  Yeah.
[59:31.850 --> 59:32.850]  Thanks, Andrew. That was funny.
[59:33.590 --> 59:34.350]  Alright, one more.
[59:35.590 --> 59:38.190]  Oh yeah, this is just like a...
[59:38.610 --> 59:39.410]  set of barrels.
[59:39.590 --> 59:40.610]  Okay, we got more hiss coming in.
[59:41.750 --> 59:42.270]  Yeah, we do.
[59:42.430 --> 59:42.850]  Another flare.
[59:50.110 --> 59:50.510]  Yeah.
[59:51.690 --> 59:53.370]  It's so great that it damages them.
[59:54.650 --> 59:55.090]  Yeah, it is.
[59:56.270 --> 59:57.010]  Okay, put more in.
[59:57.250 --> 59:58.910]  Thanks, saved my life.
[59:59.010 --> 59:59.690]  Heavy coming in.
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.090]  Coming. Get him.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.410]  I'm gonna need more ammo soon.
[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.610]  Uh, sending a barrel.
[01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:06.890]  Thanks, Geoff.
[01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:07.190]  Shit.
[01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.930]  Ah, fuck.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.290]  Hold on.
[01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:11.470]  I'm not sending it yet.
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.710]  Yeah, we're gonna need three more barrels.
[01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:16.790]  Do you have enough over there, Geoff?
[01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.150]  I have one.
[01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:19.710]  I'm about to send up.
[01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.890]  There's one charging, so we'll need one more.
[01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:22.590]  Andrew, I'm hot!
[01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:23.170]  Do you know where one is?
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.410]  Yeah.
[01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.110]  Uh, I'm pretty hot, too.
[01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:30.610]  Andrew, you wanna send that one back to Geoff?
[01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.230]  Help myself.
[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:34.830]  Yeah, I'm gonna load one in with you and then do that.
[01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.030]  Hold on, I gotta...
[01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:38.010]  I gotta run down the hill to heal Geoff real quick.
[01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:50.970]  Hot potato!
[01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.890]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:57.450]  Dude, the shower is a great place to ride out the fuckin' flare.
[01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.870]  Nice.
[01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.710]  Andrew, what were you hiding behind?
[01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:07.610]  I'm in cover here, it's just it gets hot. Like, I was shooting you and not getting me... at all.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.140]  Alright, I'm sending another barrel over. Does that mean we need one more after this?
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.780]  Yeah, do you have one empty or do you need one sent?
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.400]  Uh, I'll need one sent, I think.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:19.780]  Sending it back.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:20.740]  Hide!
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.240]  Okay, thank you.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.400]  Woo-hoo!
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.200]  Okay, I'm gonna pop open another shelter.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.100]  So expect enemies.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.840]  Let me send this...
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.600]  Need one more.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.840]  Take cover.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.200]  Yep.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.300]  Cover taken.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.940]  Hiding behind a pool table.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.160]  Oh, that heavy is coming in with...
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.860]  I'm hot. I'm very hot.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.560]  Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.060]  Oh, I might go down here. Not great.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.540]  I'm getting to you, I'm getting to you.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.200]  Oh, no.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:05.860]  Ah!
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.380]  Alright.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:07.760]  Going for you.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.420]  We were so close.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.660]  Okay, you're cooling off.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.660]  Calm down, sailor!
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.260]  Oh, Andrew! Get out of there!
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:23.620]  Oh, shit!
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.640]  Oh, fuck. I'm in here with the...
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.620]  Oh, no, guys. Oh, no, guys.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360]  I have no health.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.220]  Get me out of here!
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.400]  Oh, no, guys. I'm down.
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.240]  I'm down in the shower.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.660]  Down in the shower?
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.600]  You're down in the shower?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.180]  Yeah, one of the... one of the...
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.300]  ...pustule guys.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:41.580]  Wailing on me.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.300]  Working on him.
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.280]  Oh, you got heavy above as well.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.180]  Now that we've got all the barrels over, though, we should be able to move now, right?
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.300]  I feel like I'm not doing any damage to the pustule.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.600]  Shut up.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.220]  Uh, yeah.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.780]  I'm down.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.940]  Ah, shit. Is it the heavy above the shower?
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.060]  Oh, God!
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.260]  Oh, heavy in the shower!
[01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:13.050]  Oh, my God. It's so bad over here, guys.
[01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:13.450]  There's so many people.
[01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:14.230]  Oh, shit!
[01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:16.250]  Oh, God.
[01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:20.090]  Do we want... there's so many. Do we want to just take a bunch of lives here?
[01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.710]  Yeah, let's do it. We'll redeploy.
[01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.790]  Alright.
[01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.090]  That was rough.
[01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:27.930]  That was rough.
[01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.770]  Oh, man.
[01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:30.690]  Immediately, they're just here.
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.270]  Okay, flare coming.
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.440]  I don't know if we're safe in the bunker from the flare.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.500]  We are. We are.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:42.900]  Okay.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:43.740]  We are, I think.
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.580]  Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.260]  He's down.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:46.580]  He's down.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.400]  Alright, where's that last barrel?
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:50.940]  Okay.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.800]  Let's go get all of our shit, all these folders.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.120]  At least we went down right here.
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:59.120]  Where did the shower go?
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.660]  It's over to the left.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.140]  Okay.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.660]  Maybe there's a bunch more stuff over there.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:03.980]  Yeah.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.660]  Yeah, that's where I went down.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.780]  Do we have a barrel ready?
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:10.960]  Yeah.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.860]  I think the barrels are good, aren't we?
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:14.900]  No, we need one more.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.840]  I thought I sent the last one over.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.300]  Alright, I'm going over to put it in the...
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.000]  Is this hose not...
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.760]  Is this thing not working?
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:23.960]  Grab everything.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.540]  Does it need to be repaired or something?
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:26.360]  Oh, it's hot.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.260]  I'm getting hot, Andrew.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:27.920]  Oh, it's hot.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:28.140]  Okay.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.560]  Alright, last barrel's gone in.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.300]  Okay.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.360]  Let's seal it.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.420]  Let's group up.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.580]  Let's get that shield going.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.120]  I can cool us down.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.260]  I don't know if this is a U-job.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.460]  Or a...
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.180]  It's a Gavin job.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.220]  Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:55.600]  Okay, I'm on it.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.240]  While he's doing the other side, I'll...
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]  Okay, here we go.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.800]  Yeah, I'm just working on clearing them.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.820]  Okay, we gotta get the other side.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.340]  Nice.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.300]  Hey, and all our folders aren't in there this time.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.060]  Good job, team!
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.200]  Call the elevator.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.060]  We got two heavies.
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.500]  Yeah, let's...
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.600]  Just run by them, or...
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.540]  Sure.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.100]  Oh, we got a powerful enemy coming in.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.280]  Ashley Walker.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.060]  Grenade would be fucking nice, though.
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.300]  I freaking love...
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:26.460]  I'm gonna get rid of this.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.400]  I love my shotgun.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.660]  I gotta get rid of this pistol, man.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.920]  Yeah, that's maybe what you should use your upgrade points on.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.260]  Yeah.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.660]  Get out of here.
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.560]  Oh, there's Ashley Walker.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.020]  Coming up the stairs.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.980]  Although it's super powerful, but...
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:40.440]  I have a grenade.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:40.920]  Grenading.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.520]  Six shots is not a lot.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:43.660]  Die!
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.600]  I'm gonna drop down and grab some ammo real quick.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.180]  Ashley's down.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:49.820]  Nice.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.380]  The shotgun's pretty powerful, but just the stagger effect is amazing.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.520]  Nice.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:55.880]  Okay.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.700]  Alright, working...
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.780]  My way towards the exit.
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:01.780]  Yeah.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.220]  Same.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:02.760]  Let's do it.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.640]  Grab grenades if you can before we leave.
[01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.810]  Let's go!
[01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:12.730]  A lot of fire back here.
[01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:13.390]  Yeah, I'm coming up.
[01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.130]  Gonna need some...
[01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:14.290]  Yeah.
[01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:16.810]  A little bit of...
[01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.090]  A little bit of Andrew magic.
[01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:20.170]  Yeah.
[01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:27.910]  Nice little zigzag, Geoff.
[01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:28.590]  Going left.
[01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:29.410]  I like it.
[01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:32.170]  Everything else is so burnt out.
[01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.390]  Oh.
[01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:34.410]  I say that at the...
[01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:34.950]  Dead end.
[01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.550]  But we're good.
[01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:36.410]  Nah, we're good.
[01:06:36.530 --> 01:06:36.730]  We're good.
[01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:37.370]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:39.210]  Let's...
[01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:41.030]  Move around to the left.
[01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.010]  Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.640]  Okay, we're almost at the elevator.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.920]  How's it looking back there, Gavin?
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.560]  I can hear a lot of stuff.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.840]  There's so much.
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.340]  Do you have a grenade?
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.100]  I'm working on it.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:02.920]  It's a lot of...
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.420]  Call the elevator.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:04.500]  Nice.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:04.860]  Okay.
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.420]  Let's keep our eyes on that compound.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:07.080]  Control room.
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.360]  Damn, that's a slow lift.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:13.760]  Yeah.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.380]  Not seeing anything.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.140]  I'll check the other side while you guys are on that one.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.740]  Oh, there's a tap here if you need it.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.280]  A tap?
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.020]  Yep.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:22.780]  Locked it.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.140]  I'm good on health.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.520]  Sounds bad.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.520]  We don't have any heating issues?
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.400]  No.
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.260]  What's making the number go up faster?
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.140]  Or is it just...
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.860]  What do you mean, the elevator?
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.460]  Yeah.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:39.460]  I don't know.
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.000]  I think it's just how it's timed.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]  I don't think we're doing anything.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:42.920]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.760]  We're almost good to go.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.140]  It's awesome that we...
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.120]  Well...
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.540]  I'm gonna say it's awesome that we noticeably got better between rounds.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.420]  Don't let me forget I gotta pay our rent after this.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.300]  Just put it on hold.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.060]  Okay, let's get in the elevator.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.180]  Not the way...
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:06.840]  Nah, I wish.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:08.360]  You wish?
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:10.880]  I'll explain how far.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.120]  There we go.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:17.640]  Uh-oh.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:17.920]  What?
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.600]  Why did...
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.860]  I see what you mean.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.240]  Oh, it needs to be repaired.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.460]  It needs to be repaired.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.360]  Repair!
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.440]  I see what you mean, Andrew.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.140]  Research assistant.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:39.800]  That was awesome.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:40.840]  Oh, that was so much fun.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.940]  Well, thank you so much for watching this first episode of FPC Firebreak.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.460]  We'll be back again at some point with more of this.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:50.460]  But in the meantime, make sure to check out our Patreon at TheRegulationPod.

[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:53.580]  We got podcasts.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.540]  We got all sorts of things.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.780]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.060]  Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.080]  Bye!
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.080]  Love you.
