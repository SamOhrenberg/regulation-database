[00:00.000 --> 00:02.040]  Refresh me. Hi, everybody. Happy Friday.
[00:02.420 --> 00:03.420]  Happy Friday.
[00:04.100 --> 00:06.980]  Can I get some spum in the chat?
[00:09.580 --> 00:10.700]  Without context.
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.980]  That's a real phrase.
[00:13.260 --> 00:14.360]  It's a real phrase.
[00:14.880 --> 00:16.680]  We got the corn cats.
[00:17.580 --> 00:18.920]  Caleb, subscribe with Prime.
[00:19.040 --> 00:20.180]  They've been subscribed for three months.
[00:20.260 --> 00:22.220]  Thank you so much, Caleb Pack.
[00:23.240 --> 00:24.600]  Oh, this is exciting.
[00:25.240 --> 00:28.280]  We are going to be hitting balls with cars.
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.920]  Looks like you are.
[00:31.340 --> 00:31.960]  Oh, wait.
[00:32.840 --> 00:35.200]  Nick, did you upgrade or not upgrade?
[00:35.280 --> 00:37.140]  Did you update our Twitch description?
[00:38.020 --> 00:39.580]  I did. Oh, OK.
[00:40.180 --> 00:40.760]  Did I help?
[00:41.280 --> 00:41.560]  You did.
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.020]  Oh, you totally did help.
[00:43.080 --> 00:43.800]  I also did it.
[00:43.820 --> 00:45.040]  Let me adjust it, though.
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.680]  Let me adjust it a little bit,
[00:48.700 --> 00:50.300]  because I made an edit to it.
[00:50.860 --> 00:54.080]  Oh, I don't know if it'll pop up live
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.300]  for everybody when I do this.
[00:57.260 --> 00:59.020]  They might need to refresh.
[00:59.260 --> 00:59.560]  Done.
[01:00.660 --> 01:01.380]  Did it update?
[01:01.600 --> 01:03.000]  Is it naturally there?
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.440]  I don't know.
[01:06.300 --> 01:08.180]  It's there for me, if not refresh,
[01:08.300 --> 01:11.540]  because it is an important clarification that, you know,
[01:11.620 --> 01:15.600]  we've had some issues in the past regarding this.
[01:16.700 --> 01:18.140]  It's just us today.
[01:20.100 --> 01:22.920]  Got to make sure the people know who's playing, Nick.
[01:25.920 --> 01:28.040]  Oh, oh, clever, clever, clever.
[01:28.420 --> 01:28.440]  Yeah.
[01:29.020 --> 01:34.140]  Oh, it's totally clever and not at all a little dig at Gavin, who is not here.
[01:34.560 --> 01:35.720]  He cannot defend himself.
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.360]  This is also from my perspective today, everybody.
[01:38.460 --> 01:39.460]  Just want to be very clear.
[01:40.120 --> 01:41.620]  Yeah, I guess we're both playing.
[01:41.700 --> 01:42.520]  It is from your perspective.
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.020]  Let's hit the field.
[01:45.620 --> 01:46.400]  I think we're good to go.
[01:46.880 --> 01:47.740]  I got a hot dog.
[01:47.960 --> 01:51.020]  I got. Oh, I'm jealous of that hot dog.
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.580]  You probably have access to the hot dog.
[01:53.740 --> 01:56.400]  Do I? I'll look next time.
[01:56.560 --> 01:57.260]  It's going to competitive.
[01:58.520 --> 02:00.300]  Oh, no, it is a new season.
[02:01.740 --> 02:03.620]  Oh, I'm ranked zero of 10.
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.320]  I was really hoping that we'd be able to knock out my ranking,
[02:07.080 --> 02:08.440]  but we're starting over again.
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.680]  That's true, we might be able to do it, but it's wins, right?
[02:12.740 --> 02:14.400]  Isn't there something where you need to get 10 wins?
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.880]  No, it's no, just 10 games.
[02:17.240 --> 02:19.260]  OK, you can lose every single one.
[02:20.100 --> 02:21.780]  Is what their five minute games?
[02:22.440 --> 02:25.340]  Yeah, well, roughly, unless we go into overtime.
[02:26.900 --> 02:30.080]  They also every stoppage of play stops the clock.
[02:30.200 --> 02:31.000]  So that's true.
[02:31.300 --> 02:34.620]  OK, it might be a bit close, but we might be able to get there.
[02:35.220 --> 02:35.860]  I'm going to back up.
[02:35.900 --> 02:37.020]  I'm going to be in that if you want to push.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.400]  I'll go forward. Oh.
[02:41.080 --> 02:42.280]  Always a little bit of a.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.660]  Hey, he is. OK.
[02:44.580 --> 02:45.040]  All right.
[02:45.720 --> 02:47.020]  You got that back.
[02:47.020 --> 02:48.140]  Yeah, nice something it.
[02:51.240 --> 02:52.900]  Oh, OK, I'll go for it.
[02:52.960 --> 02:54.100]  Drift back. Oh.
[02:56.220 --> 02:57.660]  Yeah, I'm just holding the net for now.
[02:58.600 --> 02:59.200]  That's a good idea.
[02:59.700 --> 03:00.700]  Hold still. Hey, everybody.
[03:00.780 --> 03:02.000]  Happy. I hope you're having a happy day.
[03:02.060 --> 03:04.460]  And if you're watching this later, I hope you're having a happy Tuesday.
[03:05.160 --> 03:05.980]  Oh, yes, you can.
[03:06.620 --> 03:07.640]  Oh, oh, no.
[03:08.100 --> 03:08.900]  Oh, it's over me.
[03:09.500 --> 03:10.660]  Coming back your way.
[03:10.760 --> 03:13.140]  I'm just getting it to that side, going back to that.
[03:14.620 --> 03:16.640]  I was playing this with my brother the other day.
[03:17.240 --> 03:19.560]  And he's also he's also pretty decent.
[03:19.740 --> 03:23.180]  Like he's he's probably the same level as me in terms of skill.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.280]  It was pretty fun.
[03:25.940 --> 03:31.380]  But he after we finished, he was ranked higher like it in platinum.
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.600]  Oh, so we started facing.
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.580]  Yeah, well, yeah, we started facing some folks who were a little better.
[03:37.760 --> 03:40.140]  Whoop, that was bad.
[03:41.140 --> 03:43.080]  Oh, oh, oh, OK, we're OK.
[03:43.260 --> 03:43.580]  We're OK.
[03:45.760 --> 03:46.600]  All right, back here.
[03:46.600 --> 03:49.220]  Oh, I thought I was going to be able to really clear it downfield.
[03:50.480 --> 03:51.980]  Oh, all right, I'm going for it.
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.160]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[03:53.540 --> 03:54.940]  Nick, that was good.
[03:58.850 --> 03:59.610]  Coming your way.
[03:59.770 --> 04:00.570]  Yep. Wide.
[04:00.770 --> 04:01.370]  Oh, nice hit.
[04:01.550 --> 04:02.690]  That kind of just centered it.
[04:02.690 --> 04:03.070]  Oh, I got it.
[04:03.070 --> 04:04.090]  Good job. Good job. Good job.
[04:05.430 --> 04:06.850]  Let me see. Oh, they're going up the wall.
[04:08.910 --> 04:12.630]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, that was so bad.
[04:13.070 --> 04:14.690]  Oh, the replay is so embarrassing.
[04:14.990 --> 04:16.330]  The replay is real bad.
[04:16.870 --> 04:18.330]  Oh, this is a real bad one.
[04:19.950 --> 04:22.710]  I tried, but I'm still late.
[04:24.850 --> 04:28.070]  OK, there's the softest little jump that you've tried.
[04:28.270 --> 04:29.830]  I do. Oh, shit.
[04:29.890 --> 04:32.190]  OK, all right, here we go.
[04:32.250 --> 04:32.910]  Got to get into the zone.
[04:33.170 --> 04:34.170]  Oh, he missed. I'm coming up.
[04:34.390 --> 04:35.650]  Yeah, that was a mistake.
[04:35.730 --> 04:36.650]  Mistake. It's wide.
[04:37.190 --> 04:38.130]  No, it's all good.
[04:38.210 --> 04:40.030]  He launched it back his way.
[04:40.270 --> 04:41.330]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[04:42.230 --> 04:44.290]  Oh, no. Oh, thank you, Nick.
[04:44.530 --> 04:47.750]  Oh, you you saved me from a real bad replay once again.
[04:48.450 --> 04:49.210]  No, it's all right.
[04:49.410 --> 04:52.090]  Oh, oh, shit. OK, uh.
[04:55.050 --> 04:56.170]  Oh, oh, it's centered.
[04:56.250 --> 04:58.070]  I was able to touch it a little.
[04:58.210 --> 04:58.610]  There we go.
[04:59.430 --> 05:00.690]  Oh, fuck. I thought, hmm.
[05:02.110 --> 05:05.530]  I keep thinking I'm going to be able to smash it and then.
[05:06.730 --> 05:07.850]  There we go. Oh, God.
[05:09.190 --> 05:10.130]  All right, go for it.
[05:10.750 --> 05:13.070]  Fuck, I missed fucking piece of shit.
[05:13.250 --> 05:14.550]  OK, good job, Nick.
[05:17.050 --> 05:18.850]  Oh, I'm getting a little rusty.
[05:19.070 --> 05:20.150]  Oh, got to get the rest off.
[05:21.330 --> 05:22.990]  Oh, good hit. Good hit.
[05:23.590 --> 05:24.930]  Let's see if we can push it with you.
[05:26.230 --> 05:27.390]  Oh, damn, that guy.
[05:27.650 --> 05:28.890]  Oh, I'm getting bumped.
[05:30.970 --> 05:32.050]  Oh, that's wide.
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.920]  Oh, oh, that guy.
[05:37.600 --> 05:39.280]  Oh, oh, oh, I've centered it.
[05:39.340 --> 05:40.940]  I've centered it. I've centered it for them.
[05:41.160 --> 05:42.560]  Fuck. That was my fault.
[05:42.660 --> 05:44.180]  All my fault. That's OK. All my fault.
[05:44.180 --> 05:46.480]  Listen, I really screwed up the first time.
[05:46.640 --> 05:47.540]  It happens.
[05:48.160 --> 05:49.020]  I'm in that.
[05:49.720 --> 05:51.040]  Decided I don't like this car.
[05:51.820 --> 05:53.580]  Oh, do the car really?
[05:53.820 --> 05:54.960]  Does it make a difference?
[05:55.260 --> 05:58.600]  You find? I don't think so, but I'm going to say yes.
[05:58.800 --> 06:00.440]  OK, I get it.
[06:00.540 --> 06:02.040]  OK, that went over me.
[06:02.480 --> 06:04.200]  That was great. Good job, Andrew.
[06:05.140 --> 06:06.140]  You got it. You got it good.
[06:07.180 --> 06:07.860]  Oh, nice.
[06:08.380 --> 06:09.480]  Hey, that bounced off.
[06:10.280 --> 06:10.600]  You go.
[06:11.700 --> 06:13.280]  Oh, oh, oh.
[06:13.280 --> 06:16.940]  Oh, yeah, actually, these cars might actually have different hit boxes
[06:16.940 --> 06:20.260]  because this is so low that I did not touch that at all.
[06:21.660 --> 06:23.280]  OK, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[06:24.000 --> 06:25.140]  Nice. Coming back.
[06:27.140 --> 06:27.980]  I'm going up.
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.900]  OK, I'm getting the boost on the back left.
[06:31.000 --> 06:33.420]  Get in there. Yeah, Nick.
[06:33.520 --> 06:36.000]  OK. Oh, 97 more seconds.
[06:36.920 --> 06:37.960]  Plenty of time.
[06:39.660 --> 06:41.660]  Coming at you. Plenty of time. All right.
[06:42.780 --> 06:43.900]  See, this is good communication.
[06:44.020 --> 06:46.300]  A lot of times you're playing with someone, you're like, Hey, where are you?
[06:46.460 --> 06:49.400]  Yeah, uh, I'm at the ball.
[06:49.780 --> 06:52.200]  It would be such a tough game to play without communicating.
[06:53.660 --> 06:55.900]  Oh, well, let me tell you about my friend.
[06:59.240 --> 07:00.840]  Uh, OK, they're clearing.
[07:01.020 --> 07:02.440]  You can come up, I would say. Yeah.
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.840]  I'll fall back for a sec.
[07:04.780 --> 07:05.760]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[07:06.160 --> 07:07.440]  We got it. Nice, nice.
[07:09.100 --> 07:10.640]  Oh, that's bad. That's OK.
[07:12.240 --> 07:13.940]  It's fine. It's fine, they missed.
[07:15.440 --> 07:17.060]  Oh, sorry. I hit you.
[07:18.700 --> 07:19.440]  Oh, oh, come on.
[07:20.020 --> 07:22.140]  Oh, shit. OK, OK.
[07:23.180 --> 07:24.860]  I'm a little out of position.
[07:25.700 --> 07:26.280]  All right.
[07:27.160 --> 07:28.560]  Oh, I should have stayed where I was.
[07:28.920 --> 07:31.340]  Fuck. Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[07:33.540 --> 07:36.680]  Oh, yes. I hit fucking back.
[07:37.740 --> 07:39.840]  No, it's wide. OK, I'm going.
[07:39.940 --> 07:41.380]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[07:42.280 --> 07:45.380]  Fuck you. Oh, this is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[07:45.420 --> 07:46.360]  Dropping right in. OK.
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.640]  Oh, that's on me.
[07:49.900 --> 07:52.220]  That's on me. That's on me.
[07:52.560 --> 07:54.940]  I fucking flew through.
[07:56.020 --> 07:57.180]  Oh, God. OK.
[07:57.980 --> 07:59.880]  Oh, we got time. We got all offense.
[07:59.960 --> 08:01.700]  All offense. We got time. All balls.
[08:02.620 --> 08:04.780]  Who cares if they score another one? Oh, shit.
[08:04.960 --> 08:06.880]  Well, no. OK, well, I'll tell you what.
[08:06.880 --> 08:07.860]  Let's go ahead and forfeit.
[08:08.300 --> 08:09.840]  We're forfeiting. That's OK.
[08:09.900 --> 08:10.460]  Yeah, let's forfeit.
[08:10.460 --> 08:11.900]  It counts as a game.
[08:11.920 --> 08:14.200]  We're putting up the surrender flag.
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.380]  Oh, never giving up.
[08:19.560 --> 08:20.920]  OK, well, I take responsibility.
[08:21.220 --> 08:23.200]  No, that was on me more than you.
[08:23.880 --> 08:27.380]  I definitely didn't have a great one, but that's the first game.
[08:27.480 --> 08:28.720]  That's fine. Yeah.
[08:28.960 --> 08:30.180]  You know what? We're warming up. It's Friday.
[08:31.600 --> 08:32.840]  I'm going to change my car.
[08:32.960 --> 08:34.460]  Karma Farmer. There we go.
[08:34.720 --> 08:36.460]  Subscribed for three months. Thank you so much.
[08:36.840 --> 08:39.620]  I apologize to everybody in the chat if I don't see your thing.
[08:39.620 --> 08:41.800]  This is not an easy game to play and chat with.
[08:42.640 --> 08:46.500]  No, you got to really chat, chat like to one another either.
[08:47.100 --> 08:47.500]  That's true.
[08:47.640 --> 08:48.180]  Intense time.
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.320]  Andrew, how you?
[08:51.080 --> 08:52.880]  How do you like the new season challenge so far?
[08:52.900 --> 08:53.620]  I'm liking it.
[08:54.180 --> 08:57.260]  I stopped watching for a few seasons, but I'm back on this one.
[08:57.440 --> 08:59.920]  I like that they have different eras of the cast.
[09:01.180 --> 09:01.820]  What show?
[09:02.060 --> 09:04.020]  The Challenge Season 40.
[09:05.080 --> 09:05.940]  They're doing 40.
[09:06.340 --> 09:07.680]  Yeah, it's been around.
[09:07.760 --> 09:08.040]  All right.
[09:08.860 --> 09:10.420]  Multiple seasons a year, too, right?
[09:10.580 --> 09:11.740]  Yeah, like two a year, typically.
[09:13.440 --> 09:16.560]  And then I don't even think that's counting stuff like they're all stars
[09:16.560 --> 09:18.520]  and the spinoffs they've done.
[09:18.600 --> 09:20.220]  Oh, anyway, that's interesting. It's fine.
[09:20.680 --> 09:21.660]  Oh, you got this, Nick.
[09:22.000 --> 09:22.960]  Oh, that was all you.
[09:23.380 --> 09:24.200]  That was beautiful.
[09:25.720 --> 09:29.060]  I was legit surprised that that happened because both of them missed here.
[09:29.700 --> 09:30.600]  And so did I.
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.980]  These guys are more my speed.
[09:33.180 --> 09:34.220]  OK, I'll go.
[09:34.320 --> 09:35.880]  Let's both go. Who cares?
[09:36.020 --> 09:36.620]  We'll both go.
[09:37.540 --> 09:38.980]  Hand in hand, car in car.
[09:40.260 --> 09:41.580]  Yeah, wheels to wheels.
[09:41.960 --> 09:42.600]  Wheels to wheels.
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.460]  I mean, you think a Requiem for a Dream, which is not like the car wheels to wheels.
[09:52.820 --> 09:54.580]  Oh, OK. Oh, oh.
[09:56.060 --> 09:58.120]  Nice. Good hit. Good hit.
[09:58.620 --> 10:00.380]  Sorry, I was trying to keep it on line.
[10:00.480 --> 10:01.060]  Oh, I missed.
[10:02.480 --> 10:03.180]  Oh, nice hit.
[10:03.380 --> 10:05.840]  Oh, oh, too much. Way too much. Way too many beans.
[10:06.780 --> 10:08.320]  Oh, you know, sometimes you want it.
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.880]  Shit, I should have challenged.
[10:11.200 --> 10:13.960]  Oh, see, that's a that's a full bean scenario.
[10:13.960 --> 10:15.140]  I'm good with the beans there.
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.180]  But when you get to their side of the field, you can't.
[10:17.220 --> 10:17.680]  Oh, interesting.
[10:17.740 --> 10:19.060]  Can't cook those beans all the way.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.120]  Well, it depends on your scenario, I suppose.
[10:23.380 --> 10:24.740]  Right. Are you at the campfire?
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.200]  I'm in front of their goal.
[10:28.840 --> 10:29.560]  OK, campfire.
[10:29.640 --> 10:30.720]  You want full beans?
[10:31.500 --> 10:32.440]  Oh, shit. OK.
[10:32.820 --> 10:34.120]  Oh, one of them is.
[10:34.300 --> 10:35.320]  Fuck you. Just get out of here.
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.180]  I was told I saw some of the comments the last time we did this.
[10:39.300 --> 10:41.540]  I need to be more of a bully when it comes to hitting people.
[10:41.840 --> 10:43.360]  Well, congratulations.
[10:43.660 --> 10:45.500]  That's your first step towards bullyville.
[10:45.820 --> 10:47.220]  Yeah. Ah, damn. Just missed.
[10:47.860 --> 10:49.700]  This car murdering left and right.
[10:49.860 --> 10:51.120]  Like, look at this guy. Fucking dead.
[10:51.660 --> 10:52.560]  He's fucking dead.
[10:52.680 --> 10:52.860]  Not for you.
[10:55.480 --> 10:56.860]  You too. Oh, you jumped.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.420]  Oh, shit. You went for the kill.
[11:00.600 --> 11:01.100]  All right.
[11:01.440 --> 11:02.180]  I got the bloodlust.
[11:05.460 --> 11:09.680]  Oh, oh, no, no, Nick, Nick.
[11:10.060 --> 11:11.320]  Andrew, we're backing into each.
[11:11.540 --> 11:11.880]  No!
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.660]  I accept full responsibility for that one.
[11:15.240 --> 11:16.900]  We just got stuck.
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.620]  He's got a long nut.
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.160]  I backed into you. You went full into me.
[11:22.300 --> 11:22.780]  It was great.
[11:22.860 --> 11:24.240]  Wow. That's an unfortunate phrasing.
[11:24.460 --> 11:24.640]  Yeah.
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.940]  Ah, let's get this bum in the chat.
[11:29.920 --> 11:30.880]  Oh, nice.
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.920]  Oh, a little tippy tap.
[11:33.180 --> 11:34.600]  A little tippy tap.
[11:34.820 --> 11:37.400]  A little tippy tap by Lightning McQueen.
[11:38.540 --> 11:40.880]  This is the only goal I'm going to score, so I'm going to watch this replay.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.780]  I'm going to really appreciate my work.
[11:42.880 --> 11:43.420]  My little tippy tap.
[11:43.680 --> 11:45.620]  Wow. Way to squeeze it in there.
[11:45.680 --> 11:46.520]  Yeah. I'll go. You follow.
[11:46.940 --> 11:48.540]  I mean, you really, your brain.
[11:49.000 --> 11:49.860]  You got to adjust.
[11:50.860 --> 11:51.400]  What did I say?
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.980]  You got me plowing into you.
[11:53.080 --> 11:54.620]  You're talking about squeezing it in.
[11:54.800 --> 11:56.180]  It's just, it's like you got a hole.
[11:57.040 --> 11:58.720]  Look, it's Friday.
[11:59.250 --> 11:59.760]  It is.
[11:59.900 --> 12:00.440]  We're up to some stuff.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.940]  Friday's for the boys, apparently.
[12:03.180 --> 12:04.020]  Oh, OK.
[12:07.100 --> 12:08.300]  OK, we're all right.
[12:08.720 --> 12:09.380]  Let's regroup.
[12:09.780 --> 12:10.920]  Yeah, I'm in.
[12:11.020 --> 12:11.860]  Let's clear these thoughts.
[12:12.500 --> 12:12.580]  Yeah.
[12:13.600 --> 12:14.180]  I'll go.
[12:15.940 --> 12:16.400]  OK.
[12:16.580 --> 12:17.840]  I totally screwed that up.
[12:17.840 --> 12:18.240]  That looks fine.
[12:18.300 --> 12:20.160]  Oh, but it worked out really well.
[12:20.340 --> 12:20.820]  Nice hit.
[12:21.240 --> 12:21.440]  Well hit.
[12:22.100 --> 12:23.920]  Oh, I thought it was going in.
[12:26.980 --> 12:28.320]  Let's see if I can set you here.
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.320]  That's not enough.
[12:32.000 --> 12:32.880]  That's not enough.
[12:35.340 --> 12:36.440]  OK, hit back of the way.
[12:37.160 --> 12:40.960]  OK, I'm going to get boost and I'm going to come up.
[12:41.860 --> 12:42.960]  Yeah, there you go.
[12:43.020 --> 12:43.580]  Maybe not.
[12:46.600 --> 12:48.340]  Oh, he got past me.
[12:50.500 --> 12:50.900]  OK.
[12:51.440 --> 12:51.840]  Nice.
[12:53.040 --> 12:53.440]  Nice.
[12:53.940 --> 12:54.600]  Thank you.
[12:54.720 --> 12:55.200]  Oh, shit.
[12:55.300 --> 12:55.520]  He stopped.
[12:55.760 --> 12:56.260]  Nice hit.
[12:56.380 --> 12:57.040]  Nice follow.
[12:57.160 --> 12:57.820]  I love it.
[12:57.820 --> 12:58.420]  It's great.
[12:59.940 --> 13:01.200]  Oh, I was trying to kill him.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.700]  Oh, you little son of a...
[13:03.700 --> 13:05.380]  OK, going back, going back, going back, going back.
[13:07.460 --> 13:09.060]  He's going full balls.
[13:09.140 --> 13:09.500]  Nice.
[13:09.700 --> 13:10.360]  Oh, I killed a man.
[13:11.120 --> 13:12.320]  Oh, I killed a man.
[13:14.860 --> 13:15.520]  Let's see.
[13:16.540 --> 13:17.660]  So nonchalant about it.
[13:17.820 --> 13:19.120]  Oh, I should be up there.
[13:19.140 --> 13:19.800]  I should be up there.
[13:19.880 --> 13:20.440]  I should have been up.
[13:20.560 --> 13:20.840]  Fuck.
[13:21.060 --> 13:21.240]  OK.
[13:23.300 --> 13:23.700]  Nope.
[13:25.120 --> 13:25.920]  That's just...
[13:26.340 --> 13:27.300]  Nice, Nick.
[13:27.300 --> 13:28.580]  Hell of a save.
[13:31.040 --> 13:31.520]  Whoa.
[13:32.240 --> 13:34.080]  Oh, Andrew, you...
[13:35.980 --> 13:37.200]  Ah, bad angle.
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.860]  Oh, oh, oh, please be.
[13:40.980 --> 13:43.500]  No, that was on me.
[13:45.660 --> 13:47.520]  Oh, oh, sorry.
[13:48.200 --> 13:48.740]  All right, you go.
[13:48.980 --> 13:49.280]  I'll follow.
[13:51.020 --> 13:54.680]  Like that in GTA, when we're heisting, we're team no bad ideas.
[13:54.800 --> 13:56.380]  In Rocket League, we're team accountability.
[13:57.300 --> 13:59.200]  This counts as accountability.
[13:59.840 --> 14:00.880]  Hey, that's my fault.
[14:01.060 --> 14:02.440]  Oh, oh, it's good.
[14:02.640 --> 14:04.540]  Oh, OK. I blocked it.
[14:05.240 --> 14:05.600]  Fuck.
[14:06.040 --> 14:07.460]  Oh, I had such a good angle on it.
[14:07.560 --> 14:08.640]  Taking quite the bounce.
[14:09.420 --> 14:10.200]  Yeah, it was a tough one.
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.060]  Good job.
[14:11.440 --> 14:12.100]  Hey, we got a minute left.
[14:12.180 --> 14:13.440]  Thank you. I have no boost, but.
[14:14.640 --> 14:14.880]  All right.
[14:15.080 --> 14:16.600]  So if you have a play, I say go for it.
[14:16.600 --> 14:17.840]  I have no boost right now.
[14:18.980 --> 14:20.180]  Just trying to get it.
[14:20.680 --> 14:21.340]  It's the back.
[14:23.040 --> 14:24.820]  OK. Oh, it's sort of now.
[14:25.520 --> 14:26.720]  Ah, that little son of a.
[14:29.680 --> 14:30.720]  Fuck me.
[14:32.040 --> 14:33.400]  Went right over it.
[14:33.760 --> 14:35.640]  Oh, Andrew, if you got a shot, take it.
[14:35.780 --> 14:36.800]  I don't. I'm behind you.
[14:37.200 --> 14:37.760]  Oh, OK.
[14:38.280 --> 14:39.720]  Fuck. God damn it.
[14:39.860 --> 14:40.020]  OK.
[14:41.440 --> 14:41.720]  OK.
[14:42.960 --> 14:43.700]  Oh, shit.
[14:44.340 --> 14:45.260]  Oh, he missed it.
[14:45.980 --> 14:46.900]  Should have challenged that.
[14:47.160 --> 14:47.560]  Oh, nice.
[14:49.920 --> 14:51.300]  At 20 seconds, Nick.
[14:51.960 --> 14:52.300]  OK.
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.680]  Boosting, boosting, boosting.
[14:55.340 --> 14:56.420]  Oh, if you got.
[14:57.220 --> 14:58.120]  God damn it.
[14:58.220 --> 15:00.140]  I was boosting for the.
[15:00.260 --> 15:01.180]  Fuck. Oh, my God.
[15:01.880 --> 15:02.880]  OK. OK.
[15:02.980 --> 15:03.280]  That's fine.
[15:03.400 --> 15:04.080]  It's fine. It's fine.
[15:04.180 --> 15:05.620]  Oh, not good. Not good. Not good.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.540]  Oh, that's good. Go.
[15:09.320 --> 15:13.850]  Oh, oh, it's lined up.
[15:15.230 --> 15:16.390]  Oh, it's not great.
[15:16.950 --> 15:17.850]  That's fine. It's all right.
[15:17.970 --> 15:19.090]  It's we're starting off.
[15:19.210 --> 15:19.750]  We're going to build.
[15:20.010 --> 15:20.590]  We're building.
[15:22.450 --> 15:23.430]  We will not.
[15:23.430 --> 15:24.030]  No, I was.
[15:24.110 --> 15:25.230]  I was about to John Kitna.
[15:25.350 --> 15:27.230]  This is like we will win 10 games this season.
[15:27.590 --> 15:29.110]  Uh, sorry.
[15:29.170 --> 15:31.910]  That's like a 15 year old football reference.
[15:34.670 --> 15:36.010]  They are out of the line.
[15:37.670 --> 15:38.910]  We let him off the hook.
[15:39.230 --> 15:40.470]  We let him off the hook.
[15:40.510 --> 15:40.870]  OK.
[15:41.230 --> 15:42.150]  This is our bounce back.
[15:42.930 --> 15:43.650]  Here we go.
[15:48.870 --> 15:50.770]  Oh, let me see if I can boost.
[15:50.850 --> 15:51.870]  There's no boost, though.
[15:52.430 --> 15:53.530]  Not you little son of a.
[15:54.050 --> 15:55.510]  Oh, that's that's good.
[15:55.670 --> 15:56.390]  That's good.
[15:58.290 --> 15:59.470]  I'll go after it here.
[15:59.690 --> 16:00.870]  That nope missed.
[16:02.370 --> 16:03.910]  Fuck trying to knock it back.
[16:05.330 --> 16:06.050]  They cut it off.
[16:10.720 --> 16:11.560]  Nice. All right.
[16:11.720 --> 16:15.940]  OK, let's just get it to that side and then we'll regroup and think, oh, I'm going for it.
[16:15.940 --> 16:16.320]  I'm with you.
[16:18.300 --> 16:19.760]  I meant to set you missed.
[16:19.920 --> 16:20.520]  That's you, though.
[16:21.080 --> 16:24.920]  Oh, they quit.
[16:25.920 --> 16:26.460]  What up, Quilleth?
[16:26.820 --> 16:28.720]  Oh, what? One of them quit.
[16:29.440 --> 16:30.320]  Oh, we got that.
[16:30.400 --> 16:31.520]  They they knew what was coming.
[16:31.900 --> 16:32.640]  All right, you go. You go.
[16:32.700 --> 16:32.920]  You go.
[16:33.020 --> 16:33.180]  Yep.
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.280]  Yeah, I can try to set you.
[16:39.200 --> 16:39.600]  Pathetic.
[16:40.680 --> 16:42.000]  Oh, that just went in.
[16:42.080 --> 16:42.380]  OK.
[16:44.120 --> 16:44.960]  Oh, he left.
[16:45.260 --> 16:45.640]  Yeah.
[16:46.620 --> 16:49.480]  OK, that's the back bounce back we needed.
[16:49.480 --> 16:51.540]  Oh, give me that Disney money.
[16:51.980 --> 16:53.820]  They knew they didn't stand a chance.
[16:53.960 --> 16:54.900]  Hell yeah.
[16:56.780 --> 16:57.780]  That's the bounce back.
[16:58.100 --> 16:58.820]  We got the momentum.
[16:59.340 --> 17:00.700]  We can build off of this.
[17:04.030 --> 17:04.510]  Man.
[17:05.910 --> 17:07.510]  We're easily going to hit 10 games.
[17:07.870 --> 17:09.010]  It's going to be no problem at all.
[17:09.790 --> 17:10.710]  No problem.
[17:10.790 --> 17:11.310]  We're at three.
[17:12.190 --> 17:13.150]  Seven to go.
[17:13.350 --> 17:17.310]  If yeah, if we just keep up this pace, we can play 20.
[17:18.070 --> 17:18.710]  Salty shorts.
[17:18.710 --> 17:18.870]  Yes.
[17:20.670 --> 17:21.370]  I like that.
[17:21.370 --> 17:22.830]  I know a thing or two about salty shorts.
[17:26.530 --> 17:26.970]  No.
[17:29.650 --> 17:29.930]  OK.
[17:30.250 --> 17:30.690]  OK.
[17:30.910 --> 17:31.810]  I'm salty about that.
[17:32.170 --> 17:33.630]  I'm real salty about that.
[17:34.330 --> 17:35.110]  You got...
[17:35.710 --> 17:36.990]  You were caught in no man's land.
[17:37.210 --> 17:42.610]  Yeah, I was coming up and I just didn't expect that was...
[17:42.610 --> 17:42.810]  Yeah.
[17:44.730 --> 17:45.170]  Damn.
[17:45.650 --> 17:45.850]  It's OK.
[17:45.990 --> 17:46.190]  Let's give it a try.
[17:46.710 --> 17:47.270]  All right, you go.
[17:47.510 --> 17:48.070]  Three seconds in, they scored.
[17:48.070 --> 17:48.410]  Jesus.
[17:48.650 --> 17:48.810]  OK.
[17:49.510 --> 17:50.830]  Follow closely here.
[17:51.090 --> 17:51.970]  OK, that'll work.
[17:52.630 --> 17:53.290]  Maybe not.
[17:53.730 --> 17:56.030]  We're only allowed to get matched with people that aren't very good.
[17:56.690 --> 17:57.650]  How dare they?
[17:58.210 --> 17:58.650]  Here we go.
[17:59.690 --> 18:02.330]  All right, you follow that and I'll be mid.
[18:02.650 --> 18:03.090]  Just terrible.
[18:03.410 --> 18:04.310]  Oh, well, I'm going back.
[18:10.420 --> 18:11.320]  No, I'm...
[18:11.320 --> 18:12.600]  This is...
[18:12.600 --> 18:14.140]  I'm intimidated by these guys.
[18:15.060 --> 18:15.600]  Nice hit.
[18:16.160 --> 18:16.740]  Thank you.
[18:19.260 --> 18:21.060]  Yeah, these guys...
[18:21.060 --> 18:22.820]  Oh, we got some good shake and bake here.
[18:24.600 --> 18:26.680]  Oh, Nick, what a goal!
[18:27.180 --> 18:28.420]  What a goal!
[18:29.120 --> 18:31.400]  He rocket launched into that thing.
[18:31.660 --> 18:32.560]  That was incredible.
[18:34.820 --> 18:35.040]  Nick!
[18:35.040 --> 18:36.460]  Not my finest work, but it worked.
[18:36.620 --> 18:37.940]  With the dead mouse head.
[18:39.700 --> 18:42.420]  That mouse was very much alive before we hit that ball.
[18:44.520 --> 18:45.420]  Oh, push!
[18:46.960 --> 18:48.020]  Here we go.
[18:48.020 --> 18:50.080]  Oh, my God.
[18:53.080 --> 18:54.180]  I got greedy, Andrew.
[18:54.400 --> 18:54.620]  Oh!
[18:55.020 --> 18:57.300]  I tapped it, but man.
[18:57.400 --> 18:57.900]  All right, I'm back.
[18:58.060 --> 18:58.360]  I'm back.
[18:58.740 --> 19:00.420]  If you got to play for it, go for it.
[19:01.520 --> 19:01.920]  Trying...
[19:01.920 --> 19:04.060]  Okay, I got deceived by him.
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.340]  Oh, go, Nick.
[19:08.400 --> 19:08.640]  Go, Nick.
[19:08.680 --> 19:08.900]  Go, Nick.
[19:09.000 --> 19:09.900]  Oh, fuck me.
[19:10.160 --> 19:10.440]  Got it.
[19:10.440 --> 19:10.740]  How about you now?
[19:10.740 --> 19:11.160]  Oh, I missed.
[19:11.160 --> 19:11.460]  Yeah!
[19:11.840 --> 19:13.700]  We tricked him, little son of a bitch.
[19:17.420 --> 19:18.480]  Oh, just keep the pressure.
[19:18.560 --> 19:19.020]  Keep the pressure.
[19:20.240 --> 19:21.440]  Can't let up.
[19:22.000 --> 19:22.600]  Oh, shit.
[19:23.160 --> 19:23.920]  Oh, shit.
[19:23.920 --> 19:24.000]  Oh!
[19:24.300 --> 19:24.980]  Oh, damn it.
[19:25.560 --> 19:28.700]  Oh, not having any boost is fucking sucks.
[19:31.100 --> 19:31.500]  Oh!
[19:31.740 --> 19:33.500]  Oh, I hit it somehow.
[19:34.780 --> 19:35.340]  Oh, no.
[19:35.500 --> 19:35.900]  Fuck!
[19:36.100 --> 19:36.580]  Oh, Andrew.
[19:36.920 --> 19:37.680]  He angled it.
[19:37.720 --> 19:39.060]  He angled it really good.
[19:40.200 --> 19:40.580]  Oh!
[19:41.080 --> 19:41.940]  Oh, bounce back.
[19:42.020 --> 19:42.360]  Bounce back.
[19:42.660 --> 19:43.220]  Oh, get in.
[19:43.300 --> 19:43.520]  Get in.
[19:43.580 --> 19:43.800]  Get in.
[19:43.820 --> 19:44.220]  Nick!
[19:44.440 --> 19:44.780]  Yeah!
[19:45.620 --> 19:46.740]  Dude, that was awesome.
[19:47.520 --> 19:47.920]  Woohoo!
[19:47.920 --> 19:49.600]  We just gotta keep that pressure on him, I think.
[19:50.080 --> 19:50.960]  What a shot by you.
[19:51.000 --> 19:51.260]  Oh, yeah.
[19:51.620 --> 19:52.160]  Thank you.
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.420]  We just kept that pressure up on him.
[19:56.200 --> 19:56.900]  There we go.
[19:58.720 --> 19:59.520]  Holy God.
[20:00.900 --> 20:02.500]  That was nerve-wracking.
[20:03.280 --> 20:04.260]  I'm in the back.
[20:05.320 --> 20:05.720]  Alright.
[20:06.580 --> 20:07.560]  Oh, he's coming up your way.
[20:08.000 --> 20:08.860]  I'll fall back.
[20:09.140 --> 20:09.200]  Left.
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.420]  Oh, nice.
[20:12.760 --> 20:13.160]  Nice.
[20:13.240 --> 20:14.660]  Way to disrupt his push.
[20:14.780 --> 20:15.120]  There we go.
[20:15.260 --> 20:15.620]  There we go.
[20:16.540 --> 20:17.440]  Disrupt his push.
[20:20.580 --> 20:20.940]  Alright.
[20:21.280 --> 20:21.620]  Now you.
[20:21.720 --> 20:22.240]  Now you go.
[20:22.960 --> 20:23.040]  Oh.
[20:23.480 --> 20:23.740]  Shit.
[20:23.960 --> 20:25.720]  Sorry, I was trying to push you further.
[20:28.140 --> 20:28.500]  Oh.
[20:28.660 --> 20:29.040]  Oh, shit.
[20:29.260 --> 20:29.540]  Shit.
[20:29.700 --> 20:30.060]  Shit.
[20:30.200 --> 20:30.360]  Shit.
[20:30.480 --> 20:30.660]  Shit.
[20:30.820 --> 20:31.000]  Okay.
[20:31.320 --> 20:31.660]  Wide.
[20:32.400 --> 20:33.040]  Oh, thank God.
[20:33.180 --> 20:33.800]  Okay, you push.
[20:33.980 --> 20:35.020]  It's just you and them.
[20:35.840 --> 20:36.460]  I have no boost.
[20:36.540 --> 20:37.160]  This is the problem.
[20:39.100 --> 20:39.460]  No!
[20:43.280 --> 20:43.760]  Got it.
[20:43.800 --> 20:44.060]  Got it.
[20:44.060 --> 20:44.320]  Got it.
[20:44.340 --> 20:44.800]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[20:44.940 --> 20:45.420]  Beautiful hit.
[20:45.500 --> 20:46.000]  Beautiful hit.
[20:47.900 --> 20:49.060]  Oh, they scored it.
[20:49.760 --> 20:50.960]  I think that was them.
[20:51.540 --> 20:52.300]  No, it was me.
[20:53.140 --> 20:53.520]  Oh, let's see.
[20:54.080 --> 20:54.780]  What's your goal?
[20:54.940 --> 20:56.740]  I want you to know it was me.
[20:57.940 --> 20:58.880]  Oh, no, it was all you.
[20:59.000 --> 20:59.320]  Yeah.
[20:59.620 --> 21:00.420]  Yeah, baby.
[21:00.600 --> 21:01.400]  They fucked that up.
[21:01.460 --> 21:02.020]  Great job.
[21:02.160 --> 21:02.880]  Great set.
[21:03.120 --> 21:03.620]  Great set.
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.580]  Way to keep the pressure on.
[21:05.200 --> 21:05.960]  I think that's the move.
[21:06.060 --> 21:06.860]  I think we just gotta...
[21:06.860 --> 21:07.780]  I gotta be more aggressive.
[21:08.000 --> 21:08.520]  That's what I gotta do.
[21:08.620 --> 21:08.880]  Bully.
[21:09.180 --> 21:09.420]  Bully.
[21:09.560 --> 21:09.860]  Oh!
[21:10.760 --> 21:11.820]  That's a beautiful hit.
[21:12.540 --> 21:13.040]  Oh, shit.
[21:15.980 --> 21:18.040]  When you play, are you mainly locked on the ball?
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.320]  Or how often do you go free cam?
[21:20.240 --> 21:21.040]  Uh, rarely.
[21:21.340 --> 21:21.660]  Okay.
[21:22.280 --> 21:23.680]  I rarely go free cam.
[21:24.560 --> 21:28.620]  Because if I lose track of the ball and I swing back, usually it's in the goal at that point.
[21:30.100 --> 21:30.500]  Nice.
[21:31.240 --> 21:31.640]  Thank you.
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.480]  Alright, just gotta hunt that down.
[21:34.700 --> 21:37.360]  I'll do it usually if I'm looking for a boost.
[21:37.980 --> 21:39.660]  Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
[21:42.400 --> 21:43.060]  I fucking...
[21:43.060 --> 21:43.800]  Okay, I'm falling back.
[21:43.860 --> 21:46.620]  I know what I was thinking, but I just failed at it miserably.
[21:47.220 --> 21:48.760]  It's completely missed.
[21:49.200 --> 21:50.060]  Oh, shit.
[21:50.160 --> 21:51.440]  I totally effed that up.
[21:51.820 --> 21:52.680]  Oh, boy.
[21:53.180 --> 21:53.780]  Falling back.
[21:55.460 --> 21:55.800]  Alright.
[21:56.460 --> 21:57.380]  Okay, circling back.
[21:57.920 --> 21:58.440]  Ah, you little...
[21:59.280 --> 22:00.380]  You little motherfucker.
[22:01.860 --> 22:02.780]  Fuck you.
[22:02.900 --> 22:03.640]  Ooh, nice hit.
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.660]  Get out of here.
[22:07.620 --> 22:09.560]  Oh, he's just shoving me up the...
[22:09.560 --> 22:10.900]  He's trying to bully me up the wall.
[22:10.900 --> 22:11.200]  Okay.
[22:12.100 --> 22:12.620]  Andrew, go!
[22:13.080 --> 22:13.440]  No!
[22:14.060 --> 22:17.540]  Oh, he just barely blocked it.
[22:18.580 --> 22:19.080]  Where are...
[22:19.080 --> 22:19.240]  Oh.
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.120]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.460]  Oh, nice try.
[22:24.560 --> 22:24.980]  Nice follow.
[22:28.040 --> 22:29.000]  80 more seconds.
[22:29.500 --> 22:29.620]  Boost.
[22:31.140 --> 22:31.580]  Okay.
[22:31.840 --> 22:32.680]  Cut that guy off.
[22:32.700 --> 22:33.500]  You follow it if you can.
[22:33.600 --> 22:34.040]  Ah, yeah.
[22:34.120 --> 22:36.200]  He got me with the binge.
[22:37.300 --> 22:37.520]  Okay.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.020]  No, you bastard!
[22:41.380 --> 22:42.880]  Going back, going back, going back, going back.
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.020]  Ooh, nice.
[22:45.880 --> 22:46.800]  One-two punch!
[22:50.540 --> 22:51.840]  Out of the way, sir.
[22:52.700 --> 22:52.980]  Oh, no!
[22:56.600 --> 22:57.240]  Oh, no!
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.660]  I'm just going in circles like a fool.
[22:59.800 --> 23:01.760]  Like a stupid, stupid fool.
[23:02.420 --> 23:03.700]  Here we go, just over me.
[23:04.000 --> 23:04.620]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[23:04.820 --> 23:05.320]  Good hit.
[23:06.240 --> 23:06.740]  Thank you.
[23:07.600 --> 23:09.060]  Oh, shit, I'm a fool again.
[23:09.300 --> 23:09.500]  No!
[23:10.620 --> 23:11.980]  Oh, I bounced into you.
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.640]  Oh, oh, oh.
[23:14.440 --> 23:14.880]  No!
[23:15.160 --> 23:16.440]  Going back, going back.
[23:16.600 --> 23:16.960]  Yeah!
[23:17.200 --> 23:18.200]  Nice save.
[23:18.760 --> 23:19.060]  Thank you.
[23:22.720 --> 23:23.760]  Oh, shit!
[23:24.300 --> 23:25.420]  I did not see him coming.
[23:27.360 --> 23:28.300]  Okay, got it.
[23:32.350 --> 23:34.470]  Oh, it's just in the corner.
[23:34.830 --> 23:35.510]  Okay, I'm pushing it.
[23:36.370 --> 23:36.950]  Oh, shit!
[23:37.750 --> 23:38.390]  Oh, no!
[23:39.230 --> 23:39.990]  All right, you know what?
[23:39.990 --> 23:40.670]  Okay, ten seconds.
[23:40.890 --> 23:41.750]  We just got to hold for ten seconds.
[23:41.750 --> 23:42.330]  He just got me on that one.
[23:45.230 --> 23:45.550]  Defense!
[23:47.190 --> 23:48.110]  Lock it down.
[23:51.190 --> 23:52.390]  Is that the same spammer?
[23:52.550 --> 23:54.350]  Or is that just another...
[23:54.350 --> 23:55.950]  Oh, thank you so much for the sub, Harnot.
[23:56.810 --> 23:57.310]  Thank you!
[23:58.330 --> 23:59.070]  Good job, Nick.
[24:00.650 --> 24:01.910]  Thank you, let me just...
[24:05.110 --> 24:05.390]  Uh-oh.
[24:07.970 --> 24:09.930]  Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground.
[24:10.650 --> 24:11.290]  Thank God!
[24:12.270 --> 24:12.550]  Oh!
[24:15.110 --> 24:16.590]  Okay, we're getting a little bit of a run going.
[24:17.270 --> 24:17.810]  Oh, man.
[24:18.010 --> 24:21.590]  Those guys felt like they could do a little something if they got in the air.
[24:22.010 --> 24:23.130]  Oh, yeah, they were great.
[24:23.930 --> 24:24.490]  Aerial players.
[24:25.370 --> 24:29.270]  I saw someone mention in the chat asking if there were any falcons in the stream.
[24:29.470 --> 24:31.850]  We're doing a little falcon Q&A on our Discord.
[24:32.390 --> 24:32.830]  That's right.
[24:32.870 --> 24:36.190]  If you're a falcon and you don't know, or if you want to become a falcon to come join us, you can.
[24:37.150 --> 24:37.510]  I'm excited.
[24:37.690 --> 24:38.030]  It's happening.
[24:38.190 --> 24:39.690]  A little meet and greet Q&A thing.
[24:39.770 --> 24:40.450]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[24:41.130 --> 24:43.210]  We'll record it and we will post it later.
[24:44.050 --> 24:44.850]  You're unable to make it.
[24:46.190 --> 24:47.530]  Okay, that was on me.
[24:48.910 --> 24:50.870]  That was, that was on me.
[24:50.950 --> 24:51.950]  I was thinking about that Q&A.
[24:52.250 --> 24:52.350]  Hey, you're fine.
[24:52.710 --> 24:55.270]  I was thinking about that Q&A and I just went right by it.
[24:55.390 --> 24:57.150]  I was like, I got to do that later and...
[24:58.390 --> 24:58.630]  Bye, ball.
[24:58.810 --> 25:00.030]  All right, I'll go. You follow.
[25:00.270 --> 25:00.490]  Okay.
[25:02.990 --> 25:06.450]  You saying I follow really threw me for a second.
[25:06.550 --> 25:07.970]  I was like, do I have to be behind you?
[25:09.010 --> 25:10.450]  Because I was, I think a little bit.
[25:10.490 --> 25:12.130]  Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on, come on.
[25:12.210 --> 25:12.530]  Fuck.
[25:12.790 --> 25:13.650]  Come on.
[25:17.150 --> 25:18.130]  Ah, damn that guy.
[25:20.530 --> 25:21.170]  Oh, interesting.
[25:21.490 --> 25:21.730]  Okay.
[25:22.150 --> 25:22.470]  Shit.
[25:22.950 --> 25:23.470]  All right.
[25:23.550 --> 25:23.870]  Okay.
[25:25.890 --> 25:26.610]  Ah, fuck.
[25:26.690 --> 25:27.530]  I played the wall wrong.
[25:29.030 --> 25:29.350]  No.
[25:30.930 --> 25:31.510]  Go for it.
[25:34.370 --> 25:35.330]  Give it a follow, Andrew.
[25:35.630 --> 25:35.770]  Yeah.
[25:37.430 --> 25:38.130]  Oh, sent me.
[25:39.050 --> 25:39.890]  Damn that guy.
[25:40.090 --> 25:40.910]  That was a beautiful set.
[25:41.110 --> 25:41.650]  I tried.
[25:41.830 --> 25:43.330]  Yeah, but hey, not your fault.
[25:43.570 --> 25:44.630]  Good defense by now.
[25:45.190 --> 25:45.590]  Yeah.
[25:47.930 --> 25:48.330]  Nice.
[25:51.710 --> 25:53.030]  Oh, I misread it.
[25:53.350 --> 25:54.310]  Or mistimed it.
[25:54.490 --> 25:54.610]  Okay.
[25:54.650 --> 25:54.850]  Or both.
[25:54.930 --> 25:55.310]  I don't know.
[25:59.340 --> 25:59.740]  Whoa.
[26:00.700 --> 26:01.060]  Ah.
[26:02.800 --> 26:03.200]  Fuck.
[26:03.300 --> 26:03.540]  Sorry.
[26:03.920 --> 26:04.320]  Shit.
[26:06.560 --> 26:07.500]  Oh, I'm a nightmare.
[26:07.620 --> 26:08.240]  I'm a disaster.
[26:08.380 --> 26:09.620]  That was a disaster of a play.
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.360]  Oh, fuck.
[26:11.720 --> 26:12.180]  Got it.
[26:12.280 --> 26:12.760]  Yes.
[26:12.940 --> 26:13.280]  Pinched it.
[26:17.520 --> 26:18.060]  Nice.
[26:18.320 --> 26:18.740]  Nice.
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.260]  Uh, let me see if I can...
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.120]  Nope.
[26:25.520 --> 26:26.340]  Got greedy.
[26:26.620 --> 26:27.140]  Oh, go, Andrew.
[26:27.480 --> 26:27.780]  Push.
[26:28.480 --> 26:28.660]  Bah.
[26:29.080 --> 26:29.380]  Ah.
[26:29.400 --> 26:30.040]  Nice try.
[26:30.220 --> 26:30.640]  Nice try.
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.500]  I was just trying to wait it out and see if everybody else missed as well.
[26:36.540 --> 26:36.860]  Okay.
[26:37.340 --> 26:37.580]  Oh.
[26:38.580 --> 26:38.880]  Oh.
[26:40.520 --> 26:41.060]  No.
[26:41.660 --> 26:42.360]  Oh, they missed it.
[26:42.420 --> 26:43.000]  They missed it again.
[26:43.800 --> 26:44.900]  They won't miss it this time though.
[26:45.000 --> 26:45.080]  Okay.
[26:45.260 --> 26:45.600]  It's out.
[26:45.680 --> 26:45.880]  It's out.
[26:46.020 --> 26:46.560]  It's out.
[26:47.320 --> 26:47.700]  Oh, God.
[26:47.780 --> 26:48.000]  Oh, go.
[26:48.120 --> 26:48.220]  Go.
[26:48.340 --> 26:48.440]  Go.
[26:48.440 --> 26:48.560]  Go.
[26:48.560 --> 26:48.680]  Go.
[26:48.680 --> 26:48.840]  Push.
[26:48.960 --> 26:49.000]  Push.
[26:49.840 --> 26:50.020]  Push.
[26:50.020 --> 26:50.120]  Yeah.
[26:50.240 --> 26:50.900]  I'm going to cross it.
[26:50.940 --> 26:51.500]  I'm going to cross it.
[26:51.640 --> 26:51.800]  Ah.
[26:52.760 --> 26:53.660]  Oh, my God.
[26:53.860 --> 26:54.980]  How did it go that way?
[26:56.980 --> 26:57.640]  Oh, you should...
[26:57.640 --> 26:58.040]  Corner to corner.
[26:58.220 --> 26:58.780]  That was a hell of a cross.
[26:58.960 --> 26:59.700]  Holy God.
[27:01.300 --> 27:01.960]  Across the field.
[27:01.960 --> 27:02.440]  Nice.
[27:03.500 --> 27:03.860]  Oh.
[27:04.620 --> 27:05.120]  Got it.
[27:05.820 --> 27:06.180]  Oh.
[27:06.560 --> 27:07.880]  Oh, just give it a tap.
[27:07.960 --> 27:08.280]  A little tap.
[27:08.420 --> 27:08.700]  A little tap.
[27:08.820 --> 27:09.700]  A little tip, tip, tip, tip.
[27:09.880 --> 27:10.100]  Shit.
[27:10.280 --> 27:10.860]  Ah, damn.
[27:11.640 --> 27:12.000]  Shit.
[27:12.480 --> 27:12.760]  Shit.
[27:14.540 --> 27:15.100]  Oh, fuck.
[27:15.180 --> 27:15.380]  Okay.
[27:16.860 --> 27:17.460]  Oh, man.
[27:18.320 --> 27:19.400]  Completely knocked me off course.
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.040]  Okay, coming back.
[27:20.960 --> 27:21.240]  All right.
[27:21.740 --> 27:21.900]  Oh.
[27:22.160 --> 27:22.800]  Oh, nice.
[27:22.940 --> 27:23.220]  Nice.
[27:23.380 --> 27:23.660]  Nice.
[27:23.900 --> 27:24.600]  Oh, I missed.
[27:24.660 --> 27:24.880]  I missed.
[27:24.920 --> 27:25.160]  I missed.
[27:25.220 --> 27:25.400]  I missed.
[27:25.460 --> 27:25.720]  I missed.
[27:25.720 --> 27:26.160]  I missed.
[27:26.160 --> 27:26.400]  Shit.
[27:26.900 --> 27:27.320]  Here we go.
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.660]  Ah, I missed again.
[27:30.020 --> 27:30.380]  Got it.
[27:30.420 --> 27:30.720]  Got it.
[27:30.740 --> 27:31.000]  Got it.
[27:31.020 --> 27:31.800]  I got the rebound.
[27:32.260 --> 27:33.100]  Rebound in.
[27:36.620 --> 27:37.840]  Oh, my God.
[27:39.480 --> 27:40.020]  That's okay.
[27:40.340 --> 27:41.240]  My FOV is turned up all the way.
[27:42.600 --> 27:43.600]  You got the thunder.
[27:43.720 --> 27:44.460]  I got the lightning.
[27:45.920 --> 27:46.840]  Finish this thing.
[27:47.560 --> 27:48.240]  Double tap the A button.
[27:48.240 --> 27:49.140]  I'm in the back.
[27:49.560 --> 27:50.000]  You push.
[27:52.520 --> 27:53.880]  Oh, missed completely.
[27:53.880 --> 27:56.800]  I was trying to figure out what somebody was telling me.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.440]  If I'm in an aerial, if I double tap A or tap A.
[28:00.560 --> 28:00.920]  What was it?
[28:01.180 --> 28:01.920]  I have more control.
[28:02.240 --> 28:02.820]  I have no A.
[28:03.560 --> 28:03.940]  Oh, shit.
[28:04.100 --> 28:04.520]  Oh, shit.
[28:04.640 --> 28:04.860]  Fuck.
[28:04.940 --> 28:05.520]  I saved it.
[28:05.720 --> 28:06.460]  Oh, balls.
[28:06.620 --> 28:06.760]  Yeah.
[28:08.400 --> 28:09.040]  That's unfortunate.
[28:09.880 --> 28:11.400]  Yeah, my frame of view is full.
[28:11.740 --> 28:14.400]  Somebody was saying in the chat to make it wider.
[28:15.680 --> 28:18.620]  But believe you me, my frame of view is all the way out.
[28:21.040 --> 28:22.140]  Let's get a quick one back.
[28:22.440 --> 28:22.840]  All right, you go.
[28:22.840 --> 28:23.360]  Tie it back up.
[28:27.460 --> 28:28.800]  God damn, I missed.
[28:29.160 --> 28:30.000]  It's a good try, though.
[28:31.100 --> 28:31.960]  And they're smart.
[28:32.080 --> 28:32.800]  They kept someone back.
[28:32.960 --> 28:35.080]  Usually, you can sneak one right by them.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.840]  Good defense by you.
[28:42.040 --> 28:42.900]  Go, Andrews.
[28:42.920 --> 28:43.680]  Just you and the goal.
[28:45.160 --> 28:46.120]  I got it.
[28:46.200 --> 28:47.280]  Oh, thank God, Nick.
[28:47.540 --> 28:48.400]  Thank God.
[28:49.900 --> 28:51.000]  Am I in the replay?
[28:51.200 --> 28:51.640]  Yeah.
[28:52.840 --> 28:54.420]  Look at this incompetence.
[28:55.540 --> 28:57.460]  And then you just going outside.
[29:00.020 --> 29:03.600]  Like as a little kid and you're pretending that what I had to do was important.
[29:03.760 --> 29:04.740]  But really, it didn't matter.
[29:04.840 --> 29:05.520]  You were just there.
[29:07.080 --> 29:07.640]  Oh, wow.
[29:07.700 --> 29:09.240]  That just went right down the line.
[29:16.380 --> 29:16.980]  Ah, balls.
[29:19.340 --> 29:20.180]  All right.
[29:22.120 --> 29:23.500]  That's an interesting hop.
[29:24.220 --> 29:25.320]  Oh, nice hit, Andrew.
[29:25.560 --> 29:25.680]  Twinkled it.
[29:28.560 --> 29:29.020]  Yeah.
[29:29.080 --> 29:32.120]  I also realized whenever somebody is like, it's just you.
[29:32.340 --> 29:33.900]  Smooth sailing from here on out.
[29:34.340 --> 29:36.400]  Suddenly, the pressure is like weirdly built.
[29:37.280 --> 29:38.920]  Nick, it's a 1v1 right now.
[29:39.320 --> 29:40.280]  Nick, you're 1v1ing.
[29:41.160 --> 29:42.120]  Oh, interesting.
[29:43.820 --> 29:46.220]  Me and this guy are just locked in.
[29:47.900 --> 29:51.280]  Well, let me tell you how much I blew the one.
[29:51.520 --> 29:52.740]  You told me that?
[29:53.040 --> 29:55.260]  And my brain was suddenly like, just me?
[29:55.500 --> 29:55.920]  Just me?
[29:56.140 --> 29:56.580]  Just me?
[29:58.120 --> 29:58.440]  Shit.
[29:58.740 --> 29:59.140]  All right.
[29:59.180 --> 30:00.060]  You might want to disengage.
[30:01.420 --> 30:02.940]  We got a situation brewing here.
[30:05.880 --> 30:06.420]  Oh, God.
[30:06.960 --> 30:07.580]  Oh, God.
[30:07.680 --> 30:08.060]  Oh, God.
[30:08.160 --> 30:08.560]  Oh, God.
[30:08.620 --> 30:09.020]  Oh, God.
[30:09.080 --> 30:09.360]  Oh, God.
[30:09.440 --> 30:09.900]  The situation.
[30:10.200 --> 30:10.520]  The situation.
[30:10.920 --> 30:11.140]  Oh.
[30:12.480 --> 30:12.800]  Oh.
[30:15.080 --> 30:15.400]  Oh.
[30:17.120 --> 30:17.440]  Okay.
[30:17.620 --> 30:18.060]  We're getting it out.
[30:18.160 --> 30:18.360]  Push it.
[30:18.420 --> 30:18.640]  Push it.
[30:18.860 --> 30:19.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:20.120 --> 30:20.600]  Up the field.
[30:20.820 --> 30:21.100]  Up the field.
[30:21.120 --> 30:21.540]  Redeem myself.
[30:21.560 --> 30:21.720]  Push.
[30:21.920 --> 30:22.600]  Redeem myself.
[30:23.150 --> 30:24.000]  Redeem myself.
[30:24.400 --> 30:24.860]  Yeah!
[30:30.160 --> 30:33.220]  After locking horns with that guy for 40 seconds.
[30:34.840 --> 30:35.880]  It's in the goal.
[30:36.560 --> 30:37.120]  Oh, God.
[30:39.860 --> 30:40.860]  Okay, I'm in back.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.180]  Okay, I'm going.
[30:43.660 --> 30:45.160]  I'm on defense.
[30:46.400 --> 30:46.860]  Defense.
[30:47.740 --> 30:48.680]  Oh, I cut it off again.
[30:49.440 --> 30:50.500]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[30:50.900 --> 30:51.880]  Fuck outta here.
[30:52.880 --> 30:53.240]  Yes!
[30:53.780 --> 30:54.540]  Get the fuck outta here.
[30:55.340 --> 30:56.660]  Get the fuck outta here.
[30:56.720 --> 30:57.860]  We got 20 seconds.
[30:58.780 --> 31:00.960]  Oh, you're just going.
[31:04.660 --> 31:06.560]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[31:06.760 --> 31:08.440]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[31:08.660 --> 31:08.960]  Okay.
[31:09.480 --> 31:10.100]  Okay, there we go.
[31:11.160 --> 31:12.480]  I didn't get it. I didn't get it.
[31:12.700 --> 31:13.320]  Hey, it's all good.
[31:13.960 --> 31:14.300]  All good.
[31:16.800 --> 31:17.460]  Go, Nick!
[31:18.380 --> 31:18.740]  Oh!
[31:19.780 --> 31:21.080]  I wanted it, I wanted it, I wanted it!
[31:21.080 --> 31:22.060]  There doesn't have to be another one.
[31:23.400 --> 31:25.500]  Was that four in a row? Three in a row?
[31:27.260 --> 31:29.900]  Uh, that's three or four. I don't know.
[31:32.700 --> 31:34.560]  How many games does it say you have left?
[31:34.840 --> 31:35.860]  I don't even know.
[31:36.080 --> 31:38.500]  I have a new item and it's just blank on my screen.
[31:38.980 --> 31:41.440]  I got Dingo Dragon Lord Blueprint.
[31:42.040 --> 31:42.480]  Cool.
[31:43.560 --> 31:44.940]  Oh, that was three wins.
[31:46.720 --> 31:48.320]  Including the forfeit or not?
[31:48.320 --> 31:51.020]  So, we played five matches and I have three.
[31:51.120 --> 31:51.900]  There's two different things.
[31:52.200 --> 31:53.540]  There's one that's only counting wins.
[31:54.120 --> 31:54.920]  I don't know what that is, though.
[31:56.060 --> 31:57.880]  That might just be, like, to earn something.
[31:58.080 --> 31:58.760]  I don't know what it is.
[31:59.000 --> 31:59.220]  Okay.
[32:00.840 --> 32:01.820]  You know what we need to do?
[32:01.940 --> 32:02.780]  When, uh...
[32:02.780 --> 32:06.820]  We need to do another Last of Us Part 2.
[32:06.960 --> 32:07.320]  Yeah, we do.
[32:08.220 --> 32:08.820]  Because that was fun.
[32:08.820 --> 32:10.100]  I wasn't part of the first one.
[32:10.160 --> 32:11.380]  I'd love to be part of that.
[32:11.380 --> 32:12.980]  I'd love for you to be there for the next one.
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.420]  Aha!
[32:15.340 --> 32:18.080]  Are they, uh, putting out a remaster of that soon?
[32:18.160 --> 32:18.660]  Or have they already released...
[32:18.660 --> 32:19.140]  They already did.
[32:19.380 --> 32:19.680]  Okay.
[32:19.940 --> 32:20.840]  They already did. I have it.
[32:20.880 --> 32:21.580]  That's what I'm playing on.
[32:21.660 --> 32:22.100]  Oh, nice.
[32:22.380 --> 32:23.680]  I bought it because I'm a sucker.
[32:23.920 --> 32:24.540]  Oh, shit!
[32:27.400 --> 32:31.000]  I bought it because I'm a sucker and the ball just whooshes through.
[32:33.100 --> 32:34.020]  Okay, that's fine.
[32:34.380 --> 32:34.660]  Listen...
[32:34.660 --> 32:35.340]  He hit it really well.
[32:35.720 --> 32:38.020]  Establishing the caliber of player we're up against.
[32:38.680 --> 32:39.260]  They're pretty good.
[32:40.160 --> 32:41.020]  I'm gonna play back.
[32:41.700 --> 32:42.960]  Don't you, uh...
[32:42.960 --> 32:43.120]  Yeah.
[32:44.000 --> 32:44.540]  Nah, balls.
[32:45.120 --> 32:46.040]  Just playing back for a moment.
[32:46.120 --> 32:46.920]  Just playing back for a moment.
[32:46.980 --> 32:47.680]  Uh, nice.
[32:47.840 --> 32:48.000]  Ooh.
[32:48.640 --> 32:49.360]  Oh, they're good.
[32:50.900 --> 32:52.020]  Oh, they're good, Nick.
[32:52.120 --> 32:52.740]  No easy shit.
[32:52.860 --> 32:53.380]  No easy shit.
[32:55.320 --> 32:56.380]  They are very good.
[32:57.580 --> 32:58.900]  They're dribbling and stuff.
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.500]  I don't like it.
[33:00.160 --> 33:00.800]  They're dribbling.
[33:00.920 --> 33:01.320]  They're jumping.
[33:01.760 --> 33:02.300]  They're jiving.
[33:02.460 --> 33:02.940]  They're ducking.
[33:03.140 --> 33:03.660]  They're weaving!
[33:04.500 --> 33:04.880]  Ah, shit.
[33:08.100 --> 33:08.500]  Yes!
[33:08.680 --> 33:08.920]  No!
[33:09.740 --> 33:10.540]  Oh, fuck!
[33:11.080 --> 33:11.940]  Oh, shit, no!
[33:13.120 --> 33:14.300]  Okay, going back, going back, going back.
[33:14.320 --> 33:14.340]  Okay, that's why.
[33:15.500 --> 33:17.280]  Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[33:19.700 --> 33:20.020]  Daaah!
[33:22.540 --> 33:23.400]  Alright, it's coming back.
[33:24.620 --> 33:24.940]  Suck.
[33:26.020 --> 33:26.340]  Okay.
[33:28.440 --> 33:28.760]  No?
[33:29.120 --> 33:30.340]  Let's see if you can do that.
[33:30.420 --> 33:31.520]  I'll be back here just in case.
[33:31.620 --> 33:31.840]  Shit.
[33:32.840 --> 33:33.160]  Alright.
[33:33.660 --> 33:33.940]  Okay.
[33:35.940 --> 33:36.460]  Oh, God.
[33:36.620 --> 33:37.260]  I should've told you.
[33:37.320 --> 33:37.920]  I should've told you.
[33:37.920 --> 33:38.940]  I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[33:40.680 --> 33:41.120]  Okay.
[33:41.440 --> 33:42.300]  It's crossed.
[33:47.100 --> 33:47.540]  Nice.
[33:47.720 --> 33:48.940]  Yeah, that was right to him.
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.020]  Oh, wow, he actually hit that.
[33:53.740 --> 33:54.360]  Nice cut.
[33:54.560 --> 33:54.660]  Oh.
[33:56.800 --> 33:57.920]  One of them isn't here.
[33:58.000 --> 33:58.640]  We need to take...
[33:58.640 --> 33:59.420]  One of them quit.
[34:00.120 --> 34:00.380]  Yeah.
[34:00.420 --> 34:01.300]  We need to take advantage.
[34:02.120 --> 34:02.400]  Yeah.
[34:02.980 --> 34:03.420]  Yeah.
[34:04.660 --> 34:05.320]  Oh, boy.
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.840]  I'm gonna fall back just in case here.
[34:08.920 --> 34:11.080]  We can't afford to be giving up easy sh...
[34:11.080 --> 34:11.260]  Oh!
[34:12.200 --> 34:13.100]  Oh, shit, sorry.
[34:13.180 --> 34:14.180]  Sorry, sorry.
[34:16.480 --> 34:17.620]  Let's see if you got that.
[34:20.900 --> 34:21.220]  Fuck!
[34:21.720 --> 34:22.300]  Too much.
[34:23.460 --> 34:24.060]  Nice, Nick!
[34:24.180 --> 34:24.320]  Okay.
[34:24.320 --> 34:24.820]  There we go.
[34:25.960 --> 34:27.820]  Okay, alright, okay, alright, okay.
[34:29.600 --> 34:30.720]  Let's just take advantage.
[34:31.260 --> 34:32.260]  Hopefully they don't return.
[34:33.180 --> 34:33.520]  There you go.
[34:34.440 --> 34:35.460]  I'm gonna be like...
[34:35.460 --> 34:35.600]  Oh.
[34:35.780 --> 34:36.800]  Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way!
[34:36.980 --> 34:37.660]  Ah, fuck!
[34:37.800 --> 34:38.600]  Alright, just follow him.
[34:38.800 --> 34:39.140]  That's just you.
[34:39.800 --> 34:40.700]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[34:40.700 --> 34:41.540]  No, we're good.
[34:41.620 --> 34:42.260]  It's all good.
[34:42.640 --> 34:43.760]  Oh, my God.
[34:43.900 --> 34:44.300]  Sorry.
[34:44.640 --> 34:45.640]  No, it's all good.
[34:45.780 --> 34:46.360]  Out of the way!
[34:50.420 --> 34:51.420]  The competitive douchebag.
[34:52.140 --> 34:52.440]  No!
[34:52.580 --> 34:53.280]  Within came out.
[34:53.280 --> 34:54.180]  No, that was not...
[34:54.180 --> 34:55.200]  You were completely in the right.
[34:55.280 --> 34:56.100]  I just couldn't do anything.
[34:56.160 --> 34:56.720]  Oh, get in!
[34:57.480 --> 34:57.880]  Yeah!
[35:02.380 --> 35:02.780]  Defense!
[35:03.160 --> 35:06.600]  I don't know why we're chanting defense unless it's like a mockery of them.
[35:07.480 --> 35:08.160]  I guess.
[35:14.130 --> 35:15.610]  I missed, but...
[35:15.610 --> 35:15.910]  That's fine.
[35:17.150 --> 35:18.350]  I'm gonna mainly just...
[35:18.350 --> 35:18.910]  That's for you.
[35:19.150 --> 35:19.550]  Okay.
[35:19.790 --> 35:19.970]  Oh.
[35:20.510 --> 35:21.050]  Oh, wow.
[35:21.110 --> 35:22.810]  I didn't expect him to...
[35:22.810 --> 35:24.030]  I'm just bullying him.
[35:24.290 --> 35:25.070]  So, you can just...
[35:25.070 --> 35:26.650]  You do what you need to do.
[35:27.910 --> 35:28.310]  Okay.
[35:28.830 --> 35:29.230]  Yay!
[35:29.610 --> 35:30.230]  Okay, I quit.
[35:33.070 --> 35:33.470]  Easy.
[35:33.730 --> 35:33.930]  Wee!
[35:34.270 --> 35:35.610]  E-G-G-G.
[35:37.650 --> 35:38.090]  I don't know if I told you this.
[35:38.090 --> 35:40.070]  I think we got real lucky that that one guy dropped.
[35:40.450 --> 35:40.910]  Oh, yeah.
[35:40.970 --> 35:41.210]  Thank God.
[35:41.210 --> 35:41.950]  The all-star?
[35:41.950 --> 35:43.650]  Or that...
[35:44.330 --> 35:45.350]  Is that just a title?
[35:45.690 --> 35:46.130]  Yeah, is that...
[35:46.130 --> 35:46.870]  That's just a title.
[35:47.030 --> 35:47.450]  That's a title.
[35:47.570 --> 35:47.890]  Yeah, okay.
[35:48.610 --> 35:51.070]  Like, mine is forever faster or something stupid.
[35:51.250 --> 35:53.810]  All that glitters is gold.
[35:55.810 --> 35:56.970]  Okay, I'm gonna push.
[35:58.450 --> 35:58.970]  Okay.
[35:59.710 --> 36:00.670]  I'll go firsties.
[36:02.910 --> 36:03.690]  Finish it!
[36:03.930 --> 36:04.150]  Ah!
[36:10.330 --> 36:10.850]  Okay.
[36:11.330 --> 36:12.470]  All of the car...
[36:12.470 --> 36:13.690]  That was so slow.
[36:14.770 --> 36:16.290]  I did a little tap on it.
[36:16.450 --> 36:16.530]  Ah!
[36:16.690 --> 36:17.490]  And then every car...
[36:18.010 --> 36:18.370]  Okay.
[36:19.050 --> 36:20.790]  That is not what I expected to happen.
[36:21.150 --> 36:21.710]  It's coming down, Nick.
[36:21.770 --> 36:21.990]  No.
[36:22.530 --> 36:22.850]  Yeah.
[36:24.290 --> 36:24.970]  Oh, no!
[36:25.170 --> 36:25.790]  I misread it!
[36:25.810 --> 36:26.450]  That's okay, that's okay, that's okay.
[36:26.570 --> 36:27.110]  Nice follow.
[36:27.290 --> 36:27.890]  Wait, you know what?
[36:28.730 --> 36:29.290]  That's what we gotta do.
[36:29.370 --> 36:30.170]  We gotta team each other up.
[36:30.550 --> 36:30.690]  Yeah.
[36:30.970 --> 36:31.110]  Yah!
[36:33.970 --> 36:34.870]  Bicycle kick, baby.
[36:35.970 --> 36:36.270]  Huh!
[36:36.510 --> 36:37.110]  Oh, nice.
[36:37.430 --> 36:38.170]  Nice, Nick.
[36:39.050 --> 36:39.630]  Oh, shit.
[36:40.570 --> 36:40.930]  Crossing.
[36:40.990 --> 36:41.630]  Oh, shit.
[36:42.010 --> 36:42.290]  Nice.
[36:44.230 --> 36:44.590]  Goddamn.
[36:44.790 --> 36:46.350]  Let me see if I can...
[36:46.350 --> 36:46.630]  Oh.
[36:48.610 --> 36:48.970]  Well...
[36:49.910 --> 36:50.750]  There you go.
[36:50.970 --> 36:51.610]  See if you got a shot.
[36:51.890 --> 36:51.910]  Ah!
[36:51.990 --> 36:52.250]  Okay.
[36:52.530 --> 36:52.690]  Sorry.
[36:54.530 --> 36:55.810]  Gonna get back at that.
[36:56.550 --> 36:57.110]  Oh, shit.
[36:58.750 --> 36:59.470]  Oh, shit!
[36:59.570 --> 37:00.070]  Go wide!
[37:00.650 --> 37:01.190]  Oh, no!
[37:01.350 --> 37:01.830]  I thought that...
[37:01.830 --> 37:02.110]  Mmm!
[37:02.930 --> 37:04.090]  I didn't know that was going in.
[37:05.570 --> 37:05.970]  I thought...
[37:05.970 --> 37:07.610]  I was under it and I just had a bad perspective.
[37:10.170 --> 37:12.070]  I thought it was wide and I was going for the bully.
[37:12.070 --> 37:14.550]  But I don't think I could have walked in anyway, even if I tried.
[37:18.990 --> 37:19.350]  Nice.
[37:19.610 --> 37:19.870]  I missed.
[37:20.170 --> 37:20.590]  I missed.
[37:22.030 --> 37:22.390]  Ah!
[37:23.410 --> 37:23.910]  Got it.
[37:24.030 --> 37:24.150]  Ooh.
[37:26.150 --> 37:26.490]  Ah!
[37:32.680 --> 37:33.220]  It's okay.
[37:33.440 --> 37:33.640]  No!
[37:33.960 --> 37:34.380]  Oh, shit.
[37:34.520 --> 37:35.840]  That's not great, but that...
[37:35.840 --> 37:35.940]  Hey.
[37:37.260 --> 37:37.980]  That's fine.
[37:38.400 --> 37:38.840]  That's okay.
[37:39.580 --> 37:39.840]  Okay.
[37:39.900 --> 37:40.780]  We're letting them feel comfortable.
[37:41.360 --> 37:42.060]  We're giving them two point lead.
[37:42.060 --> 37:42.100]  We're getting greedy.
[37:42.620 --> 37:44.040]  They're gonna be like, oh, this is easy.
[37:44.120 --> 37:45.420]  These guys don't know what they're doing.
[37:45.420 --> 37:47.040]  When really only one of us don't know.
[37:48.360 --> 37:49.760]  And they're not gonna see that coming.
[37:50.080 --> 37:53.120]  They're not gonna see you lock in and get the edge on them.
[37:53.360 --> 37:54.200]  Turn this whole game around.
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.360]  We're lulling them into a false sense of security.
[37:56.460 --> 37:56.920]  No, we're gonna...
[37:56.920 --> 37:57.840]  Beginning now.
[37:59.640 --> 38:00.200]  Wait, what?
[38:02.220 --> 38:05.000]  See, that's me confirming my incompetence to them.
[38:05.880 --> 38:07.100]  It's all part of the plan.
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.320]  All part of the plan.
[38:08.500 --> 38:10.340]  All part of the incompetence plan, my friend.
[38:10.720 --> 38:11.520]  That was on purpose.
[38:11.900 --> 38:12.160]  Excuse me.
[38:12.180 --> 38:12.820]  That was strategic.
[38:13.100 --> 38:13.320]  See?
[38:13.500 --> 38:14.640]  We just pantsed them.
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.680]  They thought, oh, they don't know what they're doing.
[38:16.780 --> 38:18.120]  They're trying to score on their own net.
[38:18.460 --> 38:19.300]  Little did they know.
[38:19.760 --> 38:21.680]  One of us has the slightest clue.
[38:22.120 --> 38:22.940]  And by slight, I mean a lot.
[38:23.000 --> 38:23.740]  You're pretty good at this.
[38:25.460 --> 38:27.900]  You set that up real perfect by stopping them.
[38:28.320 --> 38:29.760]  Yeah, by shooting at our own goal.
[38:30.060 --> 38:30.180]  Yeah.
[38:30.820 --> 38:31.460]  Oh, shit!
[38:32.020 --> 38:32.660]  Well, you know...
[38:32.660 --> 38:33.260]  That hit the roof.
[38:34.320 --> 38:35.900]  Now they're gonna be a little bit more on guard.
[38:36.020 --> 38:37.940]  They're gonna be like, oh, one of them does know what they're doing.
[38:38.220 --> 38:38.480]  Fuck!
[38:38.800 --> 38:40.240]  I tried real hard.
[38:40.420 --> 38:41.780]  I really tried on that one.
[38:41.880 --> 38:42.940]  I made some contact.
[38:44.060 --> 38:44.620]  You did.
[38:44.620 --> 38:46.000]  They flipped it around.
[38:46.980 --> 38:47.040]  See?
[38:47.160 --> 38:48.940]  They're like, oh, no, one of them does know what they're doing.
[38:49.000 --> 38:49.840]  Let's try to score.
[38:51.520 --> 38:52.060]  That's alright.
[38:52.180 --> 38:53.960]  We're just lulling them to sleep again.
[38:54.280 --> 38:54.920]  Yeah, they're back.
[38:55.300 --> 38:56.960]  They're snoozing at the wheel.
[38:59.340 --> 39:00.200]  Hey, if you want to cut.
[39:00.620 --> 39:00.840]  Yeah.
[39:01.820 --> 39:02.920]  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[39:03.500 --> 39:04.840]  Oh, Nick, that's beautiful.
[39:05.140 --> 39:05.960]  Oh, look at...
[39:05.960 --> 39:06.340]  No!
[39:06.680 --> 39:07.040]  Damn!
[39:07.420 --> 39:08.220]  Okay, that was on me.
[39:08.480 --> 39:09.400]  Hey, a little too excited.
[39:09.560 --> 39:10.520]  I saw the ball.
[39:10.600 --> 39:11.200]  It was in the clear.
[39:11.280 --> 39:11.820]  It was in front.
[39:13.300 --> 39:13.980]  Oh, it's coming back.
[39:13.980 --> 39:14.560]  Oh.
[39:15.300 --> 39:15.780]  Hey.
[39:16.300 --> 39:17.240]  Okay, nice.
[39:17.420 --> 39:17.660]  Nice.
[39:17.800 --> 39:18.040]  Hey.
[39:18.520 --> 39:19.580]  Oh, fuck.
[39:19.740 --> 39:20.000]  Okay.
[39:20.340 --> 39:20.660]  I got it.
[39:21.280 --> 39:21.420]  Oh!
[39:22.560 --> 39:24.400]  Games just happening all around me.
[39:26.100 --> 39:27.180]  Okay, let's calm down.
[39:27.180 --> 39:27.440]  Ah!
[39:27.780 --> 39:28.040]  Okay.
[39:29.960 --> 39:30.680]  I mean...
[39:30.680 --> 39:31.660]  I was killed for my crimes.
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.260]  Let's see.
[39:34.380 --> 39:35.360]  Okay, pushing, pushing, pushing.
[39:36.040 --> 39:37.100]  Ah, you little bastard.
[39:41.700 --> 39:42.180]  Fuck!
[39:42.440 --> 39:43.540]  Oh, shit, this is bad.
[39:43.540 --> 39:44.120]  Oh, no, that's bad.
[39:44.180 --> 39:44.640]  Bad, bad, bad.
[39:46.180 --> 39:47.060]  No, Nick!
[39:47.940 --> 39:49.360]  That was huge.
[39:49.860 --> 39:51.120]  That saved the game.
[39:51.740 --> 39:52.380]  Oh, shit.
[39:52.640 --> 39:54.120]  The game would have ended if that would have went in.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.700]  You completely turned the tide.
[39:55.800 --> 39:56.540]  We still got a chance.
[39:56.620 --> 39:57.080]  We're in this.
[39:57.960 --> 39:58.480]  You got time.
[39:58.640 --> 39:58.940]  That's true.
[40:00.800 --> 40:03.180]  Two goals is way easier to overcome than three.
[40:03.320 --> 40:04.040]  That's just a fact.
[40:05.160 --> 40:06.380]  That's just basic math.
[40:08.120 --> 40:08.340]  Okay.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.480]  Six plus six equals...
[40:11.480 --> 40:12.300]  I'm not very good.
[40:13.020 --> 40:13.480]  Here we go.
[40:13.640 --> 40:14.140]  Oh, Nick!
[40:14.160 --> 40:14.540]  Ah!
[40:14.620 --> 40:15.340]  God damn it!
[40:15.980 --> 40:17.720]  I screwed up my own set.
[40:18.040 --> 40:18.560]  That's fine.
[40:18.760 --> 40:20.420]  Listen, you did great to that point.
[40:20.600 --> 40:20.940]  I'm falling back.
[40:21.480 --> 40:22.140]  I'm going for it.
[40:22.820 --> 40:23.880]  Oh, shit, Andrew!
[40:24.320 --> 40:24.740]  Okay.
[40:24.900 --> 40:25.740]  I thought you were back.
[40:26.060 --> 40:27.260]  No, I was going for the boost.
[40:27.920 --> 40:28.200]  Okay.
[40:32.520 --> 40:34.120]  Oh, life is a highway in this.
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.100]  I have music muted, but that's great.
[40:36.800 --> 40:37.860]  My music is also muted.
[40:38.720 --> 40:39.320]  We can still win.
[40:39.340 --> 40:39.540]  What a goal song.
[40:39.540 --> 40:40.360]  We just need to push.
[40:41.840 --> 40:42.080]  Okay.
[40:42.380 --> 40:42.600]  All right.
[40:42.820 --> 40:43.540]  Doing that shit.
[40:44.200 --> 40:45.040]  Oh, bad.
[40:45.780 --> 40:46.180]  Things are bad.
[40:46.180 --> 40:46.540]  Did not bad.
[40:46.540 --> 40:47.920]  Did not bounce the way I thought it would.
[40:48.440 --> 40:49.080]  Oh, you...
[40:49.080 --> 40:49.800]  Got it over.
[40:51.460 --> 40:51.900]  Okay.
[40:54.680 --> 40:55.460]  Completely missed.
[40:58.140 --> 40:58.820]  Nice, Nick.
[41:01.860 --> 41:02.780]  Oh, Nick!
[41:02.880 --> 41:03.160]  Okay.
[41:03.740 --> 41:04.360]  There we go.
[41:04.380 --> 41:04.500]  Okay, we're back in.
[41:04.580 --> 41:05.080]  Let's do this.
[41:05.160 --> 41:05.300]  Let's do this.
[41:05.300 --> 41:06.360]  You bring the competence.
[41:06.580 --> 41:07.440]  I bring the in.
[41:09.220 --> 41:09.660]  In?
[41:10.860 --> 41:11.300]  Incompetence.
[41:11.500 --> 41:12.000]  What am I saying?
[41:12.240 --> 41:12.680]  Incompetent.
[41:13.140 --> 41:13.440]  Anyway.
[41:14.440 --> 41:14.880]  Incompetent.
[41:15.400 --> 41:15.860]  There you go.
[41:15.900 --> 41:16.140]  You go.
[41:16.140 --> 41:16.520]  You push.
[41:17.000 --> 41:17.300]  I'm pushing.
[41:17.540 --> 41:18.420]  What's rule one?
[41:18.540 --> 41:19.660]  What is rule one that I'm breaking?
[41:19.760 --> 41:20.800]  I don't even know at this point.
[41:22.080 --> 41:22.720]  Rule one.
[41:23.700 --> 41:24.020]  Score.
[41:24.960 --> 41:25.920]  That's what we're about to do.
[41:27.120 --> 41:27.620]  Hell yeah.
[41:29.460 --> 41:30.620]  They're not even going to see it coming.
[41:31.160 --> 41:32.440]  They're not even going to see it coming, Nick.
[41:35.220 --> 41:35.960]  That's not great.
[41:36.180 --> 41:36.680]  What the hell does that mean?
[41:40.460 --> 41:40.780]  Okay.
[41:41.600 --> 41:42.260]  We got a minute.
[41:42.360 --> 41:42.620]  We're fine.
[41:42.720 --> 41:42.940]  We're fine.
[41:43.000 --> 41:43.320]  We're fine.
[41:43.580 --> 41:43.960]  We're fine.
[41:44.520 --> 41:44.840]  Swipe.
[41:45.220 --> 41:45.540]  Okay.
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.380]  Plenty of time.
[41:47.500 --> 41:47.580]  Plenty of time.
[41:47.580 --> 41:48.300]  Plenty of time.
[41:49.560 --> 41:49.880]  Nice!
[41:50.600 --> 41:51.400]  Within three seconds.
[41:52.700 --> 41:53.400]  Plenty of time.
[41:55.320 --> 41:56.040]  Oh, I see.
[41:56.420 --> 41:56.440]  Shit.
[41:56.440 --> 41:57.820]  When you lock with a player, you stay locked.
[41:58.260 --> 41:59.400]  Who the hell came up with that rule?
[42:00.300 --> 42:00.620]  Shit.
[42:02.220 --> 42:03.040]  Ain't got time for that.
[42:03.080 --> 42:03.540]  We got to win.
[42:04.700 --> 42:05.280]  This is it!
[42:05.700 --> 42:05.900]  Go.
[42:06.640 --> 42:06.960]  Fuck.
[42:07.020 --> 42:07.580]  Go, go, go, go.
[42:07.640 --> 42:08.060]  I missed it.
[42:08.100 --> 42:10.100]  I missed it, missed it, missed it, missed it.
[42:10.140 --> 42:10.860]  He's going to hit it.
[42:10.900 --> 42:11.420]  And I'm dead.
[42:11.560 --> 42:12.840]  You little dick wagon.
[42:14.100 --> 42:15.340]  You ultimate coward.
[42:15.540 --> 42:16.740]  You puss magus.
[42:16.740 --> 42:17.900]  You bitch.
[42:20.940 --> 42:22.640]  We've tapped into Nick's rage.
[42:23.100 --> 42:24.140]  You little bitch.
[42:24.640 --> 42:27.300]  We were drilling for oil and all we found was salt.
[42:27.320 --> 42:27.940]  There you go, Andrew.
[42:28.160 --> 42:28.360]  Yeah.
[42:29.200 --> 42:30.780]  It's a no boost.
[42:34.410 --> 42:34.830]  Him.
[42:35.090 --> 42:35.830]  It's coming back.
[42:35.990 --> 42:36.670]  Alright, well we lost.
[42:36.810 --> 42:36.930]  Fuck him.
[42:37.070 --> 42:37.510]  But we tried.
[42:39.750 --> 42:40.170]  Hey.
[42:41.670 --> 42:44.210]  Why did I try to rhyme magus with puss?
[42:44.410 --> 42:44.970]  I don't know.
[42:45.310 --> 42:46.070]  I didn't either.
[42:46.270 --> 42:46.790]  I was just fucking mad.
[42:46.790 --> 42:47.330]  You're trying.
[42:47.530 --> 42:48.430]  You're just trying stuff.
[42:48.570 --> 42:49.110]  That's okay.
[42:50.490 --> 42:50.770]  Listen.
[42:51.910 --> 42:52.890]  Winning streaks are great.
[42:53.070 --> 42:54.690]  You need to lose to set new streaks.
[42:55.130 --> 42:56.130]  We had a good streak going.
[42:56.390 --> 42:57.430]  Now we can set a new one.
[42:57.930 --> 42:58.950]  Yeah, now we start again.
[42:59.210 --> 43:00.470]  Now we just build a new streak.
[43:02.310 --> 43:03.590]  Two wins to set one.
[43:03.670 --> 43:06.130]  You gotta lose every once in a while to get that streak going again.
[43:06.870 --> 43:07.590]  Yeah, you know what?
[43:07.950 --> 43:08.850]  You're right about that.
[43:10.030 --> 43:16.470]  And also, I feel like...
[43:17.030 --> 43:19.510]  Like, six times in that game.
[43:19.930 --> 43:22.170]  Like, I think that could have easily tipped the other way.
[43:23.150 --> 43:24.810]  It felt really close.
[43:25.090 --> 43:26.010]  It felt really close.
[43:26.070 --> 43:27.490]  You too, actually, on a couple of them.
[43:27.670 --> 43:28.170]  Oh, yeah.
[43:28.330 --> 43:28.850]  I like it.
[43:28.950 --> 43:30.410]  I shot at the net real good.
[43:31.390 --> 43:33.190]  And by net, I mean ours.
[43:33.530 --> 43:34.930]  Not theirs, specifically.
[43:35.210 --> 43:36.650]  Well, that led to a goal.
[43:39.030 --> 43:40.690]  So, don't mock it too much.
[43:41.690 --> 43:43.270]  Oh, the ball just went nowhere.
[43:47.190 --> 43:49.670]  What do you want me to do in that scenario when I'm locked up?
[43:49.890 --> 43:54.310]  I think don't engage the ball.
[43:54.530 --> 43:56.330]  Because I'm coming no matter what on those.
[43:56.910 --> 43:57.010]  Got it.
[43:57.550 --> 43:58.570]  Oh, that's perfect!
[43:59.070 --> 43:59.670]  That's beautiful.
[44:00.750 --> 44:01.490]  Oh, you little bastard.
[44:01.830 --> 44:02.690]  Tried to blow me up.
[44:04.010 --> 44:05.330]  I'll clear the space for you.
[44:09.550 --> 44:10.770]  Okay, you can come up.
[44:10.850 --> 44:11.410]  I'll fall back.
[44:11.730 --> 44:13.210]  Give you room to play.
[44:13.270 --> 44:13.830]  Oh, shit!
[44:14.690 --> 44:15.090]  Balls!
[44:15.770 --> 44:17.790]  That may have been harshly my fault.
[44:18.290 --> 44:18.810]  Let's see.
[44:18.990 --> 44:20.790]  I don't see how it could have been.
[44:21.050 --> 44:21.710]  Did it hit me?
[44:23.390 --> 44:24.270]  Oh, it just...
[44:24.270 --> 44:25.810]  I think I hit it and it hit him.
[44:26.410 --> 44:26.650]  Yeah.
[44:26.970 --> 44:28.610]  And that increased the force, whatever.
[44:29.570 --> 44:30.530]  I'm not a Star Wars guy.
[44:31.410 --> 44:32.610]  I'm to the left.
[44:33.650 --> 44:34.050]  Nice.
[44:34.310 --> 44:34.870]  Nice, Nick.
[44:34.890 --> 44:35.170]  Thank you.
[44:35.990 --> 44:37.010]  Okay, I'm going mid.
[44:37.950 --> 44:38.550]  That's fine.
[44:38.890 --> 44:39.510]  Hey, that's fine.
[44:39.910 --> 44:40.530]  Shit, no pass.
[44:41.790 --> 44:43.310]  Didn't quite work the way I thought it would.
[44:47.220 --> 44:48.820]  It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up.
[44:49.860 --> 44:50.260]  Nice.
[44:52.360 --> 44:53.720]  Alright, I'm going to follow.
[44:54.060 --> 44:55.100]  Oh, Nick, go!
[44:56.500 --> 44:57.900]  Okay, I'm here for the rebound if needed.
[45:00.080 --> 45:02.000]  Oh, you don't even need the rebound!
[45:02.700 --> 45:04.100]  You're just going to feed yourself!
[45:04.640 --> 45:05.720]  Like Joey Chestnut.
[45:06.100 --> 45:07.940]  Just left and right, fist and fist.
[45:08.260 --> 45:10.120]  Ball, in, in, in.
[45:10.780 --> 45:11.180]  Insane.
[45:11.640 --> 45:12.160]  Great job.
[45:12.980 --> 45:13.980]  Oh, I shouldn't have still...
[45:13.980 --> 45:15.200]  I shouldn't have done that.
[45:15.300 --> 45:15.900]  I should have let you have that.
[45:15.900 --> 45:17.140]  No, it's all you!
[45:17.300 --> 45:18.060]  That was all you!
[45:18.560 --> 45:19.720]  It's Joey Chestnut and it up.
[45:19.740 --> 45:20.720]  There you go, nice clear.
[45:22.000 --> 45:23.200]  Oh, it's bouncing back to the mid.
[45:23.380 --> 45:24.160]  Oh, you know what?
[45:24.160 --> 45:24.840]  Is that going to go in the goal?
[45:25.880 --> 45:26.520]  Oh, damn!
[45:29.060 --> 45:29.840]  Okay, I killed one.
[45:32.540 --> 45:33.780]  Falling back for a sec here.
[45:35.340 --> 45:36.280]  Oh, nice, Nick.
[45:36.620 --> 45:37.220]  Oh, pardon?
[45:37.380 --> 45:38.780]  Oh, shit, it's coming to her for the goal!
[45:41.940 --> 45:43.880]  I thought you got him so good.
[45:43.880 --> 45:46.920]  I was like, oh man, how embarrassing for that guy.
[45:47.140 --> 45:48.900]  And then they just flipped it.
[45:50.360 --> 45:51.180]  I'm going to follow up behind you.
[45:51.600 --> 45:53.160]  I shouldn't have feinted that way.
[45:53.300 --> 45:54.100]  Should have gone the other way.
[45:55.440 --> 45:56.460]  Okay, I'm going up the wall.
[45:56.760 --> 45:57.920]  Nope, going down the wall.
[45:59.460 --> 46:01.740]  Oh, he shot it at his own thing.
[46:02.060 --> 46:02.440]  His net.
[46:04.120 --> 46:04.860]  Oh, shit!
[46:04.980 --> 46:05.380]  That's okay.
[46:05.580 --> 46:06.300]  Hey, that's fine.
[46:06.720 --> 46:07.040]  We're good.
[46:07.280 --> 46:07.780]  Didn't see him.
[46:08.120 --> 46:08.520]  Oh, nice.
[46:08.660 --> 46:09.240]  That's beautiful.
[46:10.060 --> 46:10.800]  Oh, damn it.
[46:11.580 --> 46:12.240]  I just blew it.
[46:12.240 --> 46:12.700]  Nice.
[46:15.180 --> 46:16.560]  I wanted more...
[46:16.560 --> 46:17.840]  Oh, come on!
[46:18.760 --> 46:19.480]  Okay, we're good.
[46:19.620 --> 46:20.060]  That's fine.
[46:20.360 --> 46:20.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:20.740 --> 46:21.320]  This is all good.
[46:23.940 --> 46:24.440]  Let's see.
[46:24.500 --> 46:25.140]  That was just a good shot.
[46:25.200 --> 46:26.680]  I was expecting him to hit it a little...
[46:26.680 --> 46:27.060]  Oh, yeah.
[46:27.860 --> 46:29.180]  Just a good shot by them.
[46:30.240 --> 46:30.940]  And they're loud, though.
[46:31.020 --> 46:33.120]  Hey, if they want to play good, that's fine.
[46:33.780 --> 46:34.820]  Alright, full speed ahead, Andrew.
[46:34.960 --> 46:35.120]  Yep.
[46:37.700 --> 46:38.020]  Oh.
[46:38.360 --> 46:41.100]  Didn't expect to just hit it without resistance.
[46:41.800 --> 46:42.640]  Oh, shit.
[46:42.700 --> 46:43.100]  Ah!
[46:44.920 --> 46:47.320]  I'm just mistiming and misjudging.
[46:47.880 --> 46:48.080]  Okay.
[46:48.340 --> 46:49.120]  That's not great.
[46:49.620 --> 46:50.420]  Alright, it's okay.
[46:50.540 --> 46:51.860]  We got three minutes.
[46:52.020 --> 46:52.640]  Yeah, three minutes.
[46:53.540 --> 46:54.360]  Loads of time.
[46:54.740 --> 46:56.120]  That's just good play by them, once again.
[46:57.680 --> 47:00.560]  Just following it all the way through, feeding themselves.
[47:02.040 --> 47:02.240]  They're good.
[47:02.320 --> 47:03.820]  We're just not being aggressive, maybe.
[47:04.240 --> 47:04.740]  Or something.
[47:05.500 --> 47:05.980]  Okay.
[47:06.480 --> 47:07.540]  We're not forfeiting yet.
[47:07.880 --> 47:08.260]  Audience.
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.020]  We're gonna win.
[47:10.880 --> 47:12.440]  I got greedy on that one.
[47:13.500 --> 47:14.840]  We will on the next goal.
[47:15.120 --> 47:15.540]  They're human.
[47:16.040 --> 47:17.140]  They're human, they missed.
[47:17.560 --> 47:17.960]  It's okay.
[47:18.680 --> 47:18.900]  Okay.
[47:19.020 --> 47:20.180]  Oh, now we'll forfeit.
[47:20.560 --> 47:21.160]  Okay, well.
[47:22.680 --> 47:23.520]  Now we'll forfeit.
[47:23.740 --> 47:24.300]  Okay, we'll forfeit.
[47:25.160 --> 47:27.300]  As soon as it was back here, I was like, ah, we're boned.
[47:27.500 --> 47:29.000]  There's not a lot you can do there.
[47:30.880 --> 47:31.640]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[47:31.840 --> 47:32.700]  They really turned it on.
[47:32.760 --> 47:33.400]  They found their game.
[47:34.580 --> 47:35.320]  Good for them.
[47:37.540 --> 47:37.940]  Yeah.
[47:37.940 --> 47:38.200]  Yeah.
[47:38.580 --> 47:41.320]  People seem to really like the dice and like the magic stuff.
[47:41.380 --> 47:45.300]  I don't know if that is this season's like loot or whatever.
[47:45.460 --> 47:48.700]  But I've noticed like the book quite a bit on pools.
[47:50.400 --> 47:51.580]  Or rumble mode.
[47:51.720 --> 47:52.000]  No.
[47:52.500 --> 47:53.260]  D&D stuff.
[47:55.140 --> 47:55.680]  Ah.
[47:57.140 --> 47:57.700]  Interesting.
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.360]  What the crossover everyone's been waiting for.
[48:00.600 --> 48:02.440]  Soccer car D&D.
[48:05.320 --> 48:05.880]  Weird.
[48:07.340 --> 48:07.860]  Okay.
[48:08.840 --> 48:09.560]  You alright?
[48:09.940 --> 48:11.220]  Yeah, let's do this.
[48:12.600 --> 48:13.380]  Locked in.
[48:15.040 --> 48:15.560]  Oh.
[48:16.120 --> 48:17.320]  Oh, this is interesting.
[48:17.700 --> 48:17.900]  Okay.
[48:18.160 --> 48:19.080]  In the goal!
[48:20.580 --> 48:21.080]  I mean.
[48:22.120 --> 48:23.040]  Great shot.
[48:23.180 --> 48:23.880]  Thanks, man.
[48:25.020 --> 48:27.420]  Listen, I'm pulling energy from the kicker picker.
[48:27.500 --> 48:28.540]  I'm getting in the kicker mode.
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.640]  I'm going long distance.
[48:29.760 --> 48:31.040]  I want those 50 yarders.
[48:33.180 --> 48:34.060]  I love it.
[48:34.140 --> 48:34.700]  It's the dream.
[48:34.700 --> 48:35.240]  I love it.
[48:35.520 --> 48:36.580]  You just goalied it up.
[48:36.800 --> 48:37.680]  Then they abandoned net.
[48:40.100 --> 48:40.360]  Okay.
[48:42.140 --> 48:42.920]  Good tip.
[48:44.200 --> 48:44.300]  Oh.
[48:44.300 --> 48:45.520]  Oh, good murder.
[48:46.080 --> 48:46.920]  Shot a man in Reno.
[48:51.480 --> 48:51.960]  Oh.
[48:52.060 --> 48:53.820]  Oh, I thought you had it.
[48:54.180 --> 48:55.040]  I thought I did too.
[48:55.600 --> 48:55.880]  Nope.
[48:56.740 --> 48:57.600]  Get out of here.
[48:57.940 --> 48:58.860]  I killed another man.
[48:58.960 --> 49:00.300]  You just keep killing Figgy.
[49:01.940 --> 49:02.420]  Uh.
[49:02.420 --> 49:03.080]  Uh.
[49:05.600 --> 49:06.040]  Yeah.
[49:07.100 --> 49:07.940]  Sorry about that.
[49:08.520 --> 49:09.120]  I should have hit that.
[49:10.000 --> 49:10.640]  Oh, wow.
[49:10.720 --> 49:11.180]  He got the pass.
[49:12.460 --> 49:12.900]  Nope.
[49:13.240 --> 49:13.580]  Okay.
[49:19.380 --> 49:19.820]  Yes.
[49:20.140 --> 49:20.580]  Shit.
[49:22.360 --> 49:22.800]  Nope.
[49:22.960 --> 49:23.200]  Okay.
[49:23.520 --> 49:23.960]  Oh, shit.
[49:24.120 --> 49:24.380]  Shit.
[49:24.380 --> 49:24.520]  Shit.
[49:24.680 --> 49:24.840]  Shit.
[49:25.260 --> 49:25.700]  Shit.
[49:25.740 --> 49:25.960]  Shit.
[49:26.820 --> 49:27.260]  Shit.
[49:27.260 --> 49:27.520]  Shit.
[49:27.740 --> 49:28.220]  Shit.
[49:28.340 --> 49:28.540]  Shit.
[49:29.040 --> 49:29.520]  Shit.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.300]  What was that?
[49:35.420 --> 49:36.380]  I have no idea.
[49:36.820 --> 49:38.420]  I thought you were referencing something.
[49:39.720 --> 49:42.380]  That just came deep from your Rocket League soul.
[49:42.780 --> 49:44.500]  Yeah, like, hi-ho, Kermit the Frog.
[49:44.800 --> 49:46.760]  Oh, Kermit and...
[49:46.760 --> 49:47.560]  Oh, that's awesome.
[49:54.400 --> 49:55.100]  It's over.
[49:55.160 --> 49:55.440]  It's over.
[49:55.440 --> 49:55.760]  It's over.
[49:55.980 --> 49:56.580]  Oh, shit.
[49:59.520 --> 50:00.160]  Good clear.
[50:04.220 --> 50:05.100]  Oh, shit, no.
[50:05.240 --> 50:05.340]  Okay.
[50:08.720 --> 50:09.660]  I'm scared to leave the goal.
[50:10.020 --> 50:10.700]  I'm scared to leave the goal.
[50:11.100 --> 50:11.200]  I'm scared to leave the goal.
[50:12.920 --> 50:13.240]  Oh.
[50:15.160 --> 50:15.480]  Yes.
[50:16.420 --> 50:17.060]  Oh, damn.
[50:17.220 --> 50:17.560]  God damn it.
[50:17.720 --> 50:17.860]  Okay.
[50:19.360 --> 50:20.000]  Oh, hello.
[50:20.440 --> 50:21.480]  Living bag, living bag, living bag.
[50:21.500 --> 50:22.040]  Oh, that didn't work.
[50:23.540 --> 50:24.520]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[50:25.620 --> 50:26.620]  I'm falling back.
[50:26.620 --> 50:27.540]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.480]  Oh, shit, oh, shit.
[50:31.080 --> 50:31.480]  Okay.
[50:31.980 --> 50:32.720]  Push, Andrew, push.
[50:33.140 --> 50:33.540]  Die.
[50:33.720 --> 50:34.480]  Push, Nick, push.
[50:35.640 --> 50:36.380]  Go, Nick, go, Nick.
[50:36.380 --> 50:37.820]  No, I fucked up my own shit.
[50:38.260 --> 50:39.500]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[50:39.600 --> 50:40.400]  I got the cross.
[50:41.120 --> 50:41.720]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[50:42.360 --> 50:43.220]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[50:44.120 --> 50:44.520]  Yeah.
[50:47.960 --> 50:48.360]  Teamwork.
[50:49.580 --> 50:52.220]  I serve it up and you smash it down.
[50:53.820 --> 50:54.940]  Okay, we're next to each other.
[50:55.040 --> 50:55.760]  Let's just both go.
[50:56.560 --> 50:56.720]  Wheel to wheel.
[50:57.240 --> 50:57.840]  Wheel to wheel.
[50:59.780 --> 51:00.180]  Oh.
[51:01.280 --> 51:02.040]  Wheel to wheel.
[51:03.900 --> 51:04.820]  Here we go.
[51:05.580 --> 51:05.920]  Nice.
[51:06.120 --> 51:06.660]  That's coming back.
[51:08.520 --> 51:09.500]  Ah, fuck, it went over me.
[51:09.600 --> 51:10.360]  Oh, shit, you're right here.
[51:10.500 --> 51:11.720]  Yep, and I blocked you.
[51:13.660 --> 51:14.060]  No.
[51:14.480 --> 51:15.380]  Oh, that's so rude.
[51:16.400 --> 51:17.400]  That's so rude.
[51:17.400 --> 51:17.500]  That's so rude.
[51:19.620 --> 51:22.340]  They're not allowed to just immediately score once we score.
[51:23.080 --> 51:24.680]  We barely got to enjoy that lead.
[51:25.440 --> 51:25.980]  How rude.
[51:30.820 --> 51:31.920]  Shit, okay.
[51:37.620 --> 51:38.740]  What is...
[51:38.740 --> 51:39.260]  Oh!
[51:39.460 --> 51:41.320]  Oh, good job, Nick.
[51:41.720 --> 51:42.180]  Thank you.
[51:44.260 --> 51:45.800]  I'm with you, I'm right behind.
[51:46.300 --> 51:46.860]  Fuck.
[51:47.180 --> 51:48.240]  Okay, going back.
[51:52.270 --> 51:52.830]  Wait.
[51:55.090 --> 51:55.650]  Shit.
[51:58.590 --> 51:59.150]  Okay.
[51:59.770 --> 52:01.890]  That was bad communication by them.
[52:03.610 --> 52:04.970]  Oh, God, that guy.
[52:05.050 --> 52:05.310]  Oh, sorry.
[52:05.450 --> 52:06.370]  That's okay, that's okay.
[52:06.850 --> 52:07.730]  I annihilated you.
[52:10.810 --> 52:11.370]  Yes!
[52:11.990 --> 52:12.930]  Nice, man.
[52:13.170 --> 52:14.450]  What a follow.
[52:15.810 --> 52:16.910]  What a follow.
[52:17.410 --> 52:19.870]  You did a little tap down and then I go...
[52:20.850 --> 52:23.990]  Because that guy is stuck in no man's land because he has to come to meet that.
[52:24.690 --> 52:25.450]  Perfect follow.
[52:25.710 --> 52:26.090]  Beautiful.
[52:28.690 --> 52:29.770]  Oh, shit.
[52:30.290 --> 52:30.610]  Yes!
[52:33.730 --> 52:35.070]  Oh, you stupid fool.
[52:35.150 --> 52:36.150]  That might work better.
[52:36.210 --> 52:37.330]  Way too many beans.
[52:38.850 --> 52:39.770]  Okay, cut it off.
[52:39.910 --> 52:41.230]  Let me see if I can set you.
[52:42.910 --> 52:44.570]  Oh, it's just you and goalie.
[52:44.610 --> 52:44.810]  Got it.
[52:46.730 --> 52:47.570]  Thing of beauty.
[52:47.690 --> 52:48.670]  Shit, okay, they got me.
[52:48.670 --> 52:49.730]  I'm falling back.
[52:51.230 --> 52:52.030]  Okay, I'm back.
[52:52.410 --> 52:53.170]  Oh, wow.
[52:54.370 --> 52:54.770]  Okay.
[52:54.890 --> 52:56.490]  Oh, no, it's still rolling.
[52:56.730 --> 52:57.510]  It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[53:03.930 --> 53:05.490]  Okay, that actually worked somehow.
[53:05.750 --> 53:06.790]  If you got that, go for it.
[53:07.170 --> 53:09.510]  Yeah, I should have been more aggressive.
[53:10.670 --> 53:11.350]  Oh, fuck.
[53:11.530 --> 53:13.650]  I should have fallen back.
[53:13.770 --> 53:14.510]  I was too aggressive.
[53:15.250 --> 53:15.630]  Fuck.
[53:16.090 --> 53:16.710]  That's fine.
[53:17.950 --> 53:18.990]  This is what we do.
[53:18.990 --> 53:20.930]  We take the lead, then they tie it up.
[53:21.070 --> 53:25.930]  Let's just take the lead again and then not give them time to bring it back.
[53:26.610 --> 53:27.310]  No mercy.
[53:27.590 --> 53:27.670]  What?
[53:28.890 --> 53:29.250]  Overwatch?
[53:30.510 --> 53:30.850]  Oh, no.
[53:30.970 --> 53:31.170]  Face only?
[53:34.390 --> 53:35.850]  Oh, Nick, you missed.
[53:38.270 --> 53:39.930]  Oh, my God.
[53:40.330 --> 53:40.830]  Oh, there we go.
[53:40.830 --> 53:41.650]  Nice, nice, nice, nice.
[53:42.890 --> 53:43.990]  Oh, I blew it.
[53:44.090 --> 53:45.450]  I should have let you just take a shot.
[53:45.670 --> 53:46.270]  Hey, good clear.
[53:47.110 --> 53:47.530]  Hey, thank you.
[53:49.590 --> 53:49.910]  No.
[53:51.150 --> 53:53.150]  I'm not letting that guy dribble all over us.
[53:53.690 --> 53:55.450]  Okay, it's kind of diagonally out.
[53:58.390 --> 53:59.150]  One minute remaining.
[53:59.270 --> 53:59.810]  That's perfect.
[53:59.970 --> 54:01.490]  Oh, Nick, you worthless turd.
[54:01.670 --> 54:01.830]  It's fine, it's fine.
[54:01.990 --> 54:03.170]  I tipped it a little bit.
[54:03.170 --> 54:03.290]  You got it.
[54:03.290 --> 54:04.170]  It's not ideal.
[54:04.170 --> 54:04.450]  You got it.
[54:05.370 --> 54:06.110]  No, it was fine.
[54:06.290 --> 54:07.070]  It's better than it was.
[54:07.430 --> 54:07.510]  Oh.
[54:08.730 --> 54:09.570]  Oh, the boost.
[54:10.790 --> 54:11.710]  Gotta get more boost.
[54:13.210 --> 54:14.690]  Okay, coming up, coming up, coming up.
[54:15.110 --> 54:16.350]  Okay, I'll see if I can set you here.
[54:17.350 --> 54:17.990]  Ah, crap.
[54:19.830 --> 54:20.830]  Okay, here we go.
[54:21.330 --> 54:21.910]  Here we go.
[54:24.210 --> 54:24.930]  Jumpy, jumpy.
[54:25.590 --> 54:25.930]  Nice.
[54:25.930 --> 54:26.670]  Jumpy, jumpy.
[54:27.550 --> 54:28.270]  Okay, it's down.
[54:29.810 --> 54:30.470]  This is it.
[54:30.750 --> 54:31.110]  Go, Nick.
[54:31.210 --> 54:32.110]  Go, go, go.
[54:32.270 --> 54:32.510]  Nick!
[54:32.750 --> 54:33.090]  Yeah!
[54:33.490 --> 54:33.830]  Yeah!
[54:34.190 --> 54:34.950]  What a goal!
[54:36.610 --> 54:36.950]  Dude!
[54:38.010 --> 54:38.350]  Phenomenal.
[54:38.390 --> 54:41.150]  In only 24 seconds, it's going to be tight for them.
[54:41.510 --> 54:42.210]  It's going to be close.
[54:43.190 --> 54:45.490]  I couldn't decide if I wanted to say close or tight, and it came up kite.
[54:45.930 --> 54:47.150]  It's going to be a kite for them.
[54:47.590 --> 54:48.230]  You're going to fly it.
[54:48.230 --> 54:48.470]  You know what?
[54:48.470 --> 54:48.990]  It's going to be on a string.
[54:49.070 --> 54:49.910]  I like it.
[54:50.470 --> 54:53.430]  As long as they're not Ben Franklin, we'll be fine.
[54:53.930 --> 54:54.370]  Oh, shit.
[54:54.630 --> 54:55.580]  We'll be fine.
[54:57.290 --> 54:58.410]  They ain't Ben Franklin!
[54:59.050 --> 54:59.390]  Hey!
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.900]  They ain't Ben Franklin!
[55:06.240 --> 55:06.780]  Get out of here.
[55:07.820 --> 55:09.840]  I said you ain't Ben Franklin!
[55:10.180 --> 55:10.640]  Yeah!
[55:11.200 --> 55:12.040]  You ain't shit!
[55:14.680 --> 55:16.180]  Here's your lightning, bitch!
[55:16.420 --> 55:16.940]  Yeah!
[55:18.740 --> 55:20.200]  Here's your electricity, motherfucker!
[55:23.840 --> 55:24.720]  Oh, we did it.
[55:25.160 --> 55:25.900]  We did it.
[55:26.240 --> 55:26.980]  Is that 10 games?
[55:27.220 --> 55:27.440]  Get bounce back.
[55:27.840 --> 55:29.160]  No, you're not ranked yet.
[55:32.100 --> 55:33.580]  I think it's one more, maybe.
[55:33.740 --> 55:34.120]  I don't know.
[55:34.540 --> 55:35.520]  Yeah, one more.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.780]  Coming up on 5-0-1, everybody.
[55:38.920 --> 55:39.840]  We'll probably hit it in this game.
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.900]  We'll have to hit it in this game.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  This game's at least five minutes.
[55:42.040 --> 55:43.200]  Unless they forfeit, so never mind.
[55:46.220 --> 55:48.760]  Why does your car have a chainsaw jammed into it?
[55:49.020 --> 55:51.740]  Clearly you have not been keeping up to date with Cars lore.
[55:52.520 --> 55:53.580]  I didn't do that.
[55:54.180 --> 55:54.760]  They did that.
[55:55.120 --> 55:55.520]  Lightning McQueen.
[55:55.800 --> 55:56.660]  Can you believe it?
[55:57.240 --> 55:58.140]  Yeah, his wife Sally.
[55:58.380 --> 55:59.520]  She wasn't taking his shit anymore.
[56:00.020 --> 56:00.500]  It's horror.
[56:00.760 --> 56:02.020]  It's October coming up.
[56:02.860 --> 56:04.520]  It's going to be spooky season.
[56:04.680 --> 56:05.580]  Spooky Lightning McQueen.
[56:09.100 --> 56:12.480]  Mater just hucking chainsaws with his...
[56:13.580 --> 56:14.060]  Cable?
[56:14.680 --> 56:14.940]  What is that?
[56:14.940 --> 56:15.460]  What is that called?
[56:16.480 --> 56:17.300]  Yeah, it's tow cable.
[56:18.980 --> 56:19.340]  Right?
[56:19.760 --> 56:20.340]  I think so.
[56:20.480 --> 56:23.220]  At first I thought you were talking about Larry the Cable Guy.
[56:24.180 --> 56:24.940]  Larry the Cable Guy.
[56:25.080 --> 56:25.380]  Yeah.
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.760]  Because he voices him.
[56:26.780 --> 56:27.340]  He does.
[56:29.180 --> 56:29.800]  It's searching.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.260]  We'll do one more of this and then I saw people wanted us to try the rumble mode.
[56:34.300 --> 56:34.720]  Yeah, we'll do a rumble.
[56:34.740 --> 56:35.280]  We can do a rumble.
[56:35.300 --> 56:35.520]  Sure.
[56:36.400 --> 56:37.380]  I think I've played rumble.
[56:37.460 --> 56:39.720]  It's the one where you have items and you hit things.
[56:41.500 --> 56:41.860]  Yes.
[56:41.860 --> 56:49.020]  It's a really different mechanic for sure than the standard.
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.480]  I like the basketball one.
[56:51.480 --> 56:52.960]  It's like Mario Kart power ups and stuff.
[56:53.960 --> 56:54.840]  Yeah, kind of.
[56:55.760 --> 56:58.200]  Yeah, like a punchy glove and it's all goofy.
[56:58.580 --> 57:00.260]  Punchy glove, like a tornado.
[57:00.800 --> 57:03.100]  There's like a suction thing.
[57:04.340 --> 57:05.860]  There's a plunger.
[57:13.370 --> 57:14.430]  That's coming back.
[57:14.430 --> 57:14.910]  Yeah.
[57:15.010 --> 57:15.850]  Oh boy.
[57:15.910 --> 57:16.310]  It's over.
[57:16.410 --> 57:16.590]  It's over.
[57:16.830 --> 57:17.170]  Good.
[57:17.970 --> 57:21.130]  Alright, that was weak but I got it a little bit back.
[57:23.870 --> 57:25.010]  Alright, I'm in the goal.
[57:25.370 --> 57:26.730]  So if you have a...
[57:27.950 --> 57:29.630]  That was so bad.
[57:30.150 --> 57:31.030]  That was so bad.
[57:31.950 --> 57:32.870]  Oh, okay.
[57:39.650 --> 57:40.250]  Got it.
[57:40.310 --> 57:40.550]  Got it.
[57:40.610 --> 57:40.910]  Got it.
[57:41.610 --> 57:42.450]  Oh, drop.
[57:42.630 --> 57:43.090]  Drop, bitch.
[57:43.310 --> 57:43.570]  Yeah!
[57:45.150 --> 57:46.950]  That's what you get for blowing me up, asswipe.
[57:50.410 --> 57:51.130]  From downtown.
[57:51.890 --> 57:53.050]  Okay, I'm pushing in on the left.
[57:53.150 --> 57:53.710]  Do you want to push right?
[57:54.650 --> 57:55.510]  I'm going to wait.
[57:56.230 --> 57:56.450]  Perfect.
[57:59.730 --> 58:00.350]  Oh, Nick.
[58:03.770 --> 58:05.550]  That was just a good save by them.
[58:06.390 --> 58:07.410]  That was a really good save.
[58:07.490 --> 58:08.630]  He was also in a good spot.
[58:09.790 --> 58:10.150]  Shit.
[58:10.390 --> 58:11.050]  Keep it over here.
[58:12.250 --> 58:13.110]  Keep it over here.
[58:14.050 --> 58:14.450]  Damn.
[58:14.930 --> 58:15.090]  Okay.
[58:15.690 --> 58:17.410]  Coming back but I am slow.
[58:17.530 --> 58:18.130]  I got no boost.
[58:19.750 --> 58:21.310]  Oh, that's just tough.
[58:21.310 --> 58:21.650]  We were fucked!
[58:21.970 --> 58:22.250]  Shit!
[58:22.970 --> 58:23.690]  That was just tough.
[58:24.330 --> 58:24.730]  No!
[58:25.830 --> 58:26.410]  It's alright.
[58:26.790 --> 58:27.390]  We got it.
[58:27.430 --> 58:27.770]  We're good.
[58:27.890 --> 58:29.230]  We got it.
[58:33.610 --> 58:34.370]  See that book?
[58:34.490 --> 58:35.530]  People are loving that book.
[58:36.730 --> 58:37.590]  Oh, okay.
[58:37.610 --> 58:38.730]  I was wondering what the hell you were talking about.
[58:38.790 --> 58:39.090]  I was like, what?
[58:40.630 --> 58:41.010]  Alright.
[58:46.720 --> 58:47.540]  I'm on the ceiling.
[58:47.540 --> 58:49.120]  So it's all you for a minute.
[58:49.820 --> 58:50.320]  I'm back.
[58:51.620 --> 58:52.100]  Nick!
[58:52.280 --> 58:52.760]  Nick!
[58:52.940 --> 58:53.400]  Yes!
[58:54.260 --> 58:55.960]  Remember when I said it was all you?
[58:56.380 --> 58:57.360]  It's truly all you.
[58:57.500 --> 58:58.280]  You did all that.
[58:59.240 --> 59:01.100]  I'm on the roof at this current time.
[59:04.120 --> 59:04.800]  You go.
[59:04.980 --> 59:05.220]  I'll follow.
[59:08.980 --> 59:09.320]  Oh.
[59:11.220 --> 59:13.020]  Let's get this out of here.
[59:16.120 --> 59:16.600]  Okay.
[59:16.600 --> 59:17.360]  Incoming.
[59:17.520 --> 59:17.920]  Got it.
[59:17.980 --> 59:18.620]  Nice hit.
[59:26.090 --> 59:26.530]  Ah!
[59:26.870 --> 59:28.510]  I felt so good about it too.
[59:29.910 --> 59:32.150]  I should have gone for boost instead of doing what I did.
[59:32.150 --> 59:33.250]  Going back, going back, going back.
[59:36.310 --> 59:36.970]  Nice hit.
[59:38.690 --> 59:40.010]  I'm in goal for a second.
[59:40.050 --> 59:40.170]  Oh!
[59:40.270 --> 59:40.810]  I'm going to follow.
[59:41.330 --> 59:41.770]  Mid.
[59:44.550 --> 59:44.990]  Oh.
[59:46.730 --> 59:47.290]  My greed.
[59:47.290 --> 59:49.550]  I misread it.
[59:49.650 --> 59:50.550]  I got it, I got it.
[59:50.570 --> 59:50.830]  Nice.
[59:51.650 --> 59:52.370]  Got it.
[59:52.990 --> 59:53.510]  Boosting.
[59:53.870 --> 59:54.630]  Ah, shit.
[59:54.970 --> 59:55.350]  Missed it.
[59:58.550 --> 59:59.070]  Oh.
[59:59.330 --> 01:00:00.390]  Fuck, fuck, okay.
[01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:01.150]  Oh, no.
[01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:03.070]  Yeah.
[01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:04.070]  Yeah.
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.810]  Happy 501, everybody!
[01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:08.210]  501!
[01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.230]  501 on Friday, the best time of the week.
[01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.190]  We did it.
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.190]  Another week.
[01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.170]  In the books.
[01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.550]  Not their book.
[01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:17.750]  That would mean a goal.
[01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.190]  Oh, God.
[01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.490]  Here we go.
[01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.670]  I'm with you, I'm right behind.
[01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:25.250]  I pushed him a little bit.
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:27.570]  Oh, I'm feeling good about this.
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:29.330]  Nick, I feel real good.
[01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:30.850]  I smell a goal.
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:33.410]  I smell a goal.
[01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.610]  Shit, I tried to thread that a little too much.
[01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:37.710]  Oh, shit.
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.590]  Oh, things are bad.
[01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:39.230]  Bad, bad, bad.
[01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.910]  Oh, no.
[01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:41.590]  Oh, we smelled a goal, all right.
[01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:42.950]  There was a goal cooking.
[01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:44.310]  It was, oh, man.
[01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:46.610]  As soon as that got passed, I don't know why.
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.310]  That was my own stupidity.
[01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:51.290]  Hey.
[01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:53.290]  We all make mistakes.
[01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.110]  I sure didn't help.
[01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:55.750]  It's not all on you.
[01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:57.190]  They also did pretty well.
[01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:58.270]  Yeah, I'm going.
[01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:58.710]  No, you.
[01:00:59.050 --> 01:00:59.750]  No, you go.
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:00.290]  I'm going.
[01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:02.650]  Oh, Nick.
[01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.470]  You fool of a took.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.190]  My wife and I will do that to each other sometimes.
[01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:11.250]  If we're not understanding something, we'll call each other a fool of a took.
[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.290]  Yeah?
[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:12.610]  Yeah.
[01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.990]  What is that a reference to?
[01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:16.790]  Lord of the Rings.
[01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:17.590]  Oh.
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.630]  Pedigree took.
[01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.130]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.150]  I haven't watched those movies in a really long time.
[01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.930]  Oh, shit.
[01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:28.390]  Nice hit.
[01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.830]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.030]  All good.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:30.730]  You saved me.
[01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:32.290]  I killed him.
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:33.590]  You saved Christmas time.
[01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:37.210]  Finish it.
[01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.730]  Yeah.
[01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:38.490]  Andrew.
[01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:39.570]  Thank you.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:39.690]  Oh.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:47.240]  Oh.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:47.740]  Little tap.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.500]  Did you play the Lord of the Rings third person action games?
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.020]  That were like.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.280]  Yeah, those were great.
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.000]  So much fun.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.080]  Did you ever play the RPG one that they made?
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:00.860]  No.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:01.960]  Yeah, baby.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.260]  I don't even know how that went in.
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.100]  Good job.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.220]  Thank you.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.200]  There was a.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:07.680]  It was like.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.180]  The third age or something.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:20.580]  It all takes place during the movies, but it's an RPG and there's like one additional character who's just like a knight who's a member of the fellowship.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.120]  And you happen to be there for like all the major events of.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.820]  Well, except for anything with the with Frodo and Sam.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.500]  But I mean like.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.040]  Oh.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.020]  Oh, no.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.520]  I did this to us.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.120]  It's over.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.060]  No, they missed.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.060]  And then you saved it.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.160]  Oh, barely.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.340]  I don't think I even touched it.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.080]  Fuck Frodo.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.580]  You're the hero here.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:43.480]  Oh.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.120]  No.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.520]  Hey, nice.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.760]  Oh, you bastard.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.520]  Oh, you prick.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.400]  Shit.
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.560]  Oh, I saw.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.340]  Oh.
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:01.980]  Yeah.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:04.540]  Aggression.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.360]  I was going to say, I wish I was on the other side to clear it and you didn't need to.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.120]  You just kept it all trapped up within them.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.660]  They couldn't get it out.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.160]  You're just all in their shit.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:14.300]  Oh.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.180]  All right, you go.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:17.560]  Okay.
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:22.260]  Oh.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.340]  Oh, fuck.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.220]  I'm falling back.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:24.900]  Okay.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.980]  No reason to even mess with this shit.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.460]  Oh, fuck.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.880]  Andrew.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.400]  Oh, but they blew it.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.000]  We're so lucky.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:37.980]  They blew it.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:38.460]  Oh.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.860]  Listen, I don't know what's more embarrassing.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.700]  That we did what we did.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:42.900]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.620]  Or that they blew that.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.840]  I think equal.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.460]  I think we all just held hands around the embarrassing tree.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.820]  Maybe this will be cut from the VOD altogether.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:50.940]  That whole sequence.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.020]  For everybody's sake.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.080]  Okay.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:55.980]  Oh, God.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:56.800]  Oh, God.
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:57.080]  Okay.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.520]  He's trying to dump it.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.340]  Oh, balls.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:04.500]  Okay.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.420]  Oh, that was good for us.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.300]  So where do we think you're going to land on...
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.200]  Rank...
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.300]  Ah, scheisse.
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:13.660]  Oh, fuck.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:14.180]  On what?
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:15.920]  On...
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.100]  I think you're going to be a gold three.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:18.860]  Oh.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.880]  I don't remember what I was last time.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:21.960]  I don't either.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.400]  I'm going to guess I was...
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.280]  Yeah, I think I might have been gold three.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.100]  I'm going to say I'm the same I was last time.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:27.600]  No mercy.
[01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:33.710]  Nice.
[01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:35.390]  There we go.
[01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.910]  We did it.
[01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:36.730]  We did it.
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:37.930]  We did it.
[01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.010]  What's my rank?
[01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:42.950]  Here we go.
[01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:43.750]  Let's find out.
[01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:45.170]  Gold three!
[01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:49.590]  Welcome to the club.
[01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:50.070]  Congratulations.
[01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:51.210]  Thank you.
[01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:56.310]  Let's go to the main menu and play a game of Rumble.
[01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.010]  And then we can wrap up the stream.
[01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.750]  Did it tell you what division you are?
[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.730]  I'm sure it did, but I did not see.
[01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:05.550]  Okay.
[01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:10.310]  Oh, they've got 2v2 hoops back as a ranked player.
[01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.990]  Oh, it's only 2v2?
[01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.350]  Whoops.
[01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:14.990]  Let's... you know what?
[01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.650]  Nick, do you want to do 2v2 hoops and then a 3v3 Rumble?
[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:19.850]  Yeah, I do.
[01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:20.870]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.670]  You know what?
[01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.150]  We got to do because people seem excited about Rumble.
[01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:26.130]  We got to do Rumble, but I know you love hoops.
[01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:28.990]  Andrew's gold three, y'all.
[01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.490]  I am gold three.
[01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:33.070]  He's gold three.
[01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.130]  Division...
[01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.510]  How do I check division?
[01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.730]  I don't know.
[01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:44.670]  No, I didn't go there.
[01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:47.730]  I wonder if nobody plays this game type thing.
[01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:49.990]  That might be the case because...
[01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:51.430]  Let's take a look.
[01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:54.530]  It says average search time is 10 minutes.
[01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.310]  So, I don't think we'll be doing hoops.
[01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:02.990]  Oh, Andrew, we could join a 2v2...
[01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:06.710]  tournament.
[01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:07.450]  No, I'm kidding.
[01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.090]  How do I... okay, cancel search.
[01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.150]  3v3 Rumble.
[01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.070]  Alright, we're going to Rumble it up to finish it out, everybody.
[01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.110]  So, happy Friday, happy whatever day of the week you're watching this VOD.
[01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:19.690]  Back later.
[01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:20.830]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.670]  These are always fun.
[01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.650]  I like these a lot.
[01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:24.730]  Oh, it's always so much fun.
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.910]  We have good teamwork.
[01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.570]  Where do I find my rank?
[01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:30.910]  Or division, or whatever.
[01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.190]  A profile.
[01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:34.570]  Career.
[01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.830]  Stats.
[01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:39.530]  League ranking.
[01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:40.530]  Okay, I can go to your...
[01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:43.290]  Nope, that's not what I meant to do.
[01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.330]  Nope, that's not what I meant to do.
[01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:49.010]  Nope, that's not what I meant to do.
[01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.430]  Well, now hold on.
[01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:54.410]  That's not it.
[01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:59.870]  Wait, choose banner?
[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.730]  Will you tell me about my friend here, please?
[01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.690]  Oh, here we go.
[01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:06.930]  Let's get that Canadian energy going.
[01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:08.630]  Canadian... what?
[01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.710]  I just realized I can add a banner.
[01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:12.210]  I haven't had a banner this whole time.
[01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:17.030]  Is that the flag you fly, or what?
[01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.270]  It's like the name.
[01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:20.270]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.480]  Oh, good.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.780]  I just reached everything.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.480]  Now we can switch.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.860]  So, I think it's just like a 10 second cooldown when you use something.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.520]  So, you get something every 10 seconds.
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.620]  Or, 10 seconds you have it.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.180]  When you use it, another 10 second cooldown until you get it again.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.960]  If you blow up, again, a 10 second thing until you get it.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.280]  Alright.
[01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:51.790]  So, I'm back.
[01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:53.770]  I'm hanging out in the goal, just chilling.
[01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:55.490]  Not doing much.
[01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.170]  Alright, that guy's rotating, I guess.
[01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:58.330]  I mean, I don't know what they're doing.
[01:07:58.590 --> 01:07:59.030]  Crossing.
[01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:01.170]  How do you use the...
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:02.950]  Click left stick?
[01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:04.390]  Oh, he froze it.
[01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.110]  I vaguely remember how to play this.
[01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:08.410]  Okay, so that's...
[01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:11.090]  Okay.
[01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:15.610]  It's definitely a process of remembering what all these things do.
[01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:17.950]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.610]  Watch out, he's got spikes.
[01:08:20.690 --> 01:08:20.970]  It's over.
[01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.490]  Okay.
[01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:23.670]  He blew it.
[01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:26.950]  Oh, nice hit.
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:27.630]  What a...
[01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.870]  Thank you.
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.310]  Oh, nice.
[01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:30.950]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.270]  Alright, you know what?
[01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:32.470]  Thanks, boom.
[01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.930]  From our back wall, through the AI.
[01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.130]  I don't...
[01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:42.010]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.170]  Oh, is that what he said?
[01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:44.970]  Yeah, no.
[01:08:45.150 --> 01:08:46.970]  My symbol or whatever.
[01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.770]  Oh.
[01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.170]  My baner.
[01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.650]  Yeah.
[01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:52.210]  Whoa.
[01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:55.390]  Oh!
[01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:59.150]  I found my game type.
[01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:00.610]  Yeah.
[01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:01.810]  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:07.950]  Andrew Pan.
[01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.950]  Butts.
[01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:11.130]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.030]  Real sorry about that.
[01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:14.790]  Yeah.
[01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.330]  That is real Canadian energy, my man.
[01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:18.610]  Sorry.
[01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:21.290]  Okay.
[01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:24.130]  Three seconds till we get the next ability.
[01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.230]  Let's see.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:25.910]  What do I have?
[01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:26.410]  What do I have?
[01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:27.330]  Oh, what the fuck is that?
[01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.550]  That's bad, bad, bad.
[01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.150]  Argh!
[01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.650]  I don't know what that was.
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.930]  I'm on fire!
[01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:34.150]  I think it was unrelated to what I did.
[01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.590]  It was like a teleport thing?
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:42.510]  I forget how the teleport thing works, actually.
[01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:44.150]  I think maybe I pull them to where I'm standing?
[01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:46.050]  I don't know.
[01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.070]  Anyway.
[01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:47.830]  Or you just...
[01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:50.230]  Let's get some more goals.
[01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:51.950]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:54.810]  Oh.
[01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.910]  That's it.
[01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:56.430]  Argh!
[01:09:58.570 --> 01:09:59.010]  Alright.
[01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.830]  What do we got here?
[01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.470]  Oh, I tried to freeze it.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:06.170]  Somebody keeps using that d...
[01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:06.350]  Nice!
[01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.730]  Nice!
[01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:10.630]  Argh!
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.720]  Get that shit out!
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.580]  Oh, nice.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.400]  Usually you can do it just to send it straight into the goal.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.100]  Oh!
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:23.880]  Careful!
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:24.520]  Oh!
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.000]  That's over?
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.800]  I don't think I like the magnet.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.380]  Maybe I just don't know how to use it.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.140]  But it didn't really seem all that effective.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:36.680]  I've missed.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.360]  Missed.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:38.600]  Missed.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:39.900]  Alright.
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.220]  Completely blew all that shit.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:42.980]  Oh, God.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:43.320]  Okay.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:43.800]  Alright.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:46.180]  Alright.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.140]  Okay.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:48.360]  Alright.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:48.800]  Okay.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:50.900]  Turn on a ma...
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.900]  It feels very much like that.
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:53.360]  Okay.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:55.940]  What do we got?
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:56.460]  Oh, a tornado.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:58.700]  I'm gonna save that for now.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.700]  Ah, you bastard.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.080]  Oh, sorry.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.140]  Okay.
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.140]  Oh, a tornado?
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:08.480]  Yeah!
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.580]  I'm living my best Twister's life, baby.
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.420]  Oh!
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.440]  Get in!
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:15.740]  Oh!
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.200]  Come on!
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:17.760]  I gotcha!
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:17.880]  Yeah!
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:19.940]  Oh, my God.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.200]  Ooh!
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.120]  Nice job with the magnet.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.180]  That thing's really hard to utilize.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.020]  Thank you, Stinky Cheese Dog.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.180]  Have a great weekend.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.320]  Bye, Stinky Cheese Dog!
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.820]  I think the magnet, you just gotta get real close with it from what I could tell that time.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.000]  Like, it pulled a lot more as long as I kept looking.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.700]  You gotta stay in a range.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:38.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.060]  We got some dog updates next week on the episode, I think.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:42.860]  Oh, we do?
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.120]  Oh, yeah, we do.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:44.780]  Yeah, we do.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.760]  I thought you meant for when we record that, like, you heard something.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.160]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.000]  We got some substantial.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.340]  That's for you.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.180]  Nice.
[01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:57.610]  Watch this.
[01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:02.870]  Yeah, the dog updates have been fun.
[01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.390]  And also, people have been going crazy with hot dogs in a way.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.210]  Like, I know Geoff has talked about it.
[01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:09.670]  But it's just...
[01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:14.090]  I looked at our subreddit one day, and it was like eight posts in a row about hot dogs.
[01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:15.510]  People are going crazy.
[01:12:16.090 --> 01:12:17.570]  Guys, it's not a competition.
[01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:19.690]  It is not a contest.
[01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:21.690]  It's, uh...
[01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:22.830]  We're just experimenting.
[01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:26.870]  Seeing if we can do what the thing says is the average.
[01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:30.190]  You know, the truth according to the hot dog lobby.
[01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:31.630]  Oh, what a punch.
[01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:32.690]  There you go.
[01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:36.750]  Oh, balls.
[01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:37.210]  Whoa.
[01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:39.530]  Okay.
[01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:41.050]  That was impressive.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.060]  I don't know what they did.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.420]  That was just full boost.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.080]  Our goalie was not prepared.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:56.300]  He had the power up on, so it just flew off of him.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.280]  Oh, I see. Okay.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.340]  It's like the fist one, I think.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.320]  I apologize, goalie.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.500]  You did great.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.140]  I mean, really.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.000]  Oh, boy.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.000]  I got it.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:07.600]  That's... yeah.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.720]  Oh, the boot.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.180]  Oh, that kicks a car away.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.500]  Oh, somebody warped me.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:14.580]  Fuck out of here.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.320]  Get out of here, ball.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.320]  Fuck off.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:18.860]  Ah!
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.860]  Hey, boom.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:23.460]  Eat a dick.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:24.680]  Shit.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:25.920]  Ah!
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:27.720]  Uh-oh.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.100]  Get out of here.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.120]  Nice clear.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.380]  Thank you.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.580]  Oh, nice follow.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:36.920]  Horse?
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.100]  Hmm.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.040]  Oh, I'm going apeshit.
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:44.260]  Oh, no.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:44.700]  Just get out of here.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.280]  Just get out.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.020]  Just get out.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:46.440]  Ah!
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.680]  Oh, no.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.000]  Get out of here.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.400]  Get out of here, Nick.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.500]  You look like Free Willy coming out of the water.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:13:59.800]  He felt like it.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.620]  He felt like it.
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.200]  He felt... no!
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:01.780]  Get it out!
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.100]  No!
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.160]  It's high, or is that 4-3?
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:07.840]  4-3?
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.120]  Okay.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.300]  That's fine.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.440]  That's fine.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.660]  47 seconds we can hold.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.400]  Damn you, Santy.
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:17.700]  Damn you.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:18.760]  Okay.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.560]  Here we go.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:23.440]  Yeah.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:23.940]  Oh!
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:24.760]  Nice, Nick.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:25.920]  That was real close.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.080]  Let me see if I can just drop it in on you.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:30.420]  Ah, damn.
[01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:35.990]  Ah, the power.
[01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:37.330]  Excuse me.
[01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:39.070]  Hahaha.
[01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.030]  The ability to activate boost on someone else is so funny.
[01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:44.510]  No!
[01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:45.750]  Oh, yes.
[01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:46.510]  Way to go.
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.490]  Good job, Santy.
[01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:49.990]  Stop warping me, you little pricks.
[01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:53.030]  There we go.
[01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:57.390]  Yeah.
[01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.630]  I missed.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.420]  Oh, no!
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.560]  Oh, no!
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:10.980]  We're good.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.240]  We're good.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:11.500]  We're good.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.260]  Oh, what a win!
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:14.640]  Thanks for watching.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.500]  I wonder if that will count in my 10 overall wins or if it resets.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:18.900]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.520]  Whatever that thing is.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.540]  Uh, it doesn't look like it.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.160]  Oh, you get ranked and unranked?
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:25.840]  What the hell is this?
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.380]  Yeah, that's 7 out of 10 wins.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.160]  Weird.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.580]  I get ranked in this now?
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:32.060]  Yeah.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:32.140]  Huh.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:32.760]  I don't know.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.240]  Anyway, this has been so much fun.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:39.160]  Thank you so much for joining us on this exciting Friday.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:44.460]  Uh, those who are falconing up and want to stop by for that Q&I later.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.500]  Q&I?
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.080]  Jesus Christ.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.480]  Question and information.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.380]  Uh, question and information.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:51.500]  Exactly.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.240]  Thanks, Nick, for the recovery, much like in Rocket League.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.380]  You're there with the rebounds.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.000]  Uh, everyone have a great rest of their week.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.220]  And, uh, we'll see you tonight if you're around.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.040]  If not, get ready for a great weekend or whatever you planned.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:08.920]  RegulateYourOn.com!
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.100]  RegulateYourOn.com!
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.800]  The Regulatory Pod on Patreon.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.720]  Thank you so much for all of the support.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.280]  Buh-bye!
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.440]  Buh-bye!
