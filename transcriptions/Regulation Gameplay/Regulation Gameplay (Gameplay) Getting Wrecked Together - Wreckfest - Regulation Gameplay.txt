[00:00.000 --> 00:03.180]  We're doing WreckFest today. It's a regulation WreckFest.
[00:03.360 --> 00:04.760]  I've never played this mode.
[00:05.100 --> 00:06.600]  This is a demolition derby game.
[00:06.740 --> 00:07.720]  How are you guys doing?
[00:08.100 --> 00:10.620]  You ready to crash cars and drive and stuff?
[00:10.820 --> 00:12.080]  Yeah, let's do it. Yeah.
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.280]  Do we want to all lock in on?
[00:14.380 --> 00:15.600]  Because there's a bunch of wacky vehicles.
[00:15.700 --> 00:20.120]  Do we want to have the normal base vehicle or do we want to do like a lawnmower race?
[00:20.540 --> 00:22.060]  We could do a school bus race.
[00:22.080 --> 00:23.980]  We could do a sofa. Sofa car.
[00:24.160 --> 00:25.260]  Oh, I think we should do sofa car.
[00:25.340 --> 00:26.240]  Can we get that? Sofa car.
[00:27.420 --> 00:27.840]  Yeah, dude.
[00:27.840 --> 00:30.320]  Why does Geoff have a better sofa car than us?
[00:31.280 --> 00:32.560]  What? I've played the game before.
[00:33.460 --> 00:34.760]  Oh, wow. Wow.
[00:34.800 --> 00:36.580]  Geoff's played this? That's fucked up.
[00:36.600 --> 00:38.680]  Not a lot, but I played a little bit.
[00:38.980 --> 00:39.780]  Let's go. All right.
[00:40.200 --> 00:41.940]  I mean, it's been out for 100 years.
[00:42.840 --> 00:45.120]  Oh, OK. I had no idea.
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.760]  And I downloaded it last night and played it for like two hours.
[00:50.520 --> 00:51.720]  OK, let's ready up.
[00:51.780 --> 00:53.080]  Let's see how sofa car race goes.
[00:53.140 --> 00:53.840]  I feel good about this.
[00:54.480 --> 00:55.740]  How do you think you drive in this?
[00:55.740 --> 00:57.780]  Probably are right.
[00:57.960 --> 01:00.480]  I can tell you right trigger is gas.
[01:00.620 --> 01:03.600]  Left trigger is brake and B is.
[01:03.940 --> 01:05.200]  Let's go. And that's it.
[01:05.440 --> 01:06.440]  That's all. All right, here we go. Three.
[01:07.120 --> 01:09.180]  Wow. This is my. This is wow.
[01:09.460 --> 01:11.160]  Gavin has an awesome skin.
[01:11.840 --> 01:12.780]  That's what I was doing.
[01:12.820 --> 01:14.800]  Wow. Oh, my God.
[01:15.040 --> 01:17.600]  I didn't realize you could fly off and die.
[01:18.560 --> 01:19.920]  Geoff fucking blew it.
[01:20.100 --> 01:23.560]  Oh, my. Oh, oh, boy.
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.780]  Oh, no. One lap.
[01:28.080 --> 01:29.580]  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.080]  Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.780]  Oh, no. Oh, I just went over your foot.
[01:33.860 --> 01:34.720]  I'm sorry. Your ankle.
[01:35.420 --> 01:37.840]  Dude, my ankle integrity is lower than ever.
[01:40.160 --> 01:41.560]  These handbrakes do nothing.
[01:42.180 --> 01:44.640]  Yeah, the the B is the handbrake.
[01:44.740 --> 01:45.900]  It does nothing. Crank it.
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.740]  Oh, there's some tires there.
[01:48.540 --> 01:49.780]  Oh, I'm coming for you, Gavin.
[01:49.880 --> 01:51.680]  It's so swirly.
[01:51.940 --> 01:53.000]  This is awesome.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.820]  This rocks. What a find.
[01:57.180 --> 01:59.160]  Oh, no, it's about to end already.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.700]  No! Why did you set one lap?
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.900]  Yes! Yes! Yes! In front of Nick!
[02:04.340 --> 02:05.980]  No! Why do you ever set up the game?
[02:05.980 --> 02:07.760]  Why would you do one lap?
[02:09.860 --> 02:10.700]  Terrible at it.
[02:10.920 --> 02:12.040]  Why would you do that?
[02:12.820 --> 02:14.300]  Tell him how you really feel, Gavin.
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.480]  What did he call you earlier?
[02:18.600 --> 02:19.580]  Call him a doofus.
[02:21.020 --> 02:22.320]  He's full doofus.
[02:23.840 --> 02:27.240]  Can we? I want to do that same car again, but I want to do more.
[02:27.500 --> 02:31.040]  I and Andrew, I know that you love playing the same fucking courses over and over.
[02:31.260 --> 02:33.600]  But can we do more than one lap on a different course?
[02:35.320 --> 02:36.820]  You got it. Thanks, man.
[02:37.020 --> 02:38.420]  And in future without asking.
[02:39.780 --> 02:40.440]  Here we go.
[02:41.920 --> 02:42.780]  There we go.
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.320]  He didn't listen to that or he didn't hear.
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.200]  What? Yeah, exactly.
[02:51.660 --> 02:53.660]  I'm going to use a different car, but it's OK.
[02:53.860 --> 02:55.200]  Why did you use a different car?
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.640]  Why did you change cars?
[02:56.920 --> 02:58.300]  Oh, he's a bug.
[03:00.040 --> 03:00.780]  That's pretty cool.
[03:00.920 --> 03:02.020]  Here we go. I'm an outhouse.
[03:03.260 --> 03:04.160]  Jump! Kill him!
[03:04.400 --> 03:05.340]  Jump! Kill the outhouse!
[03:05.520 --> 03:07.300]  Get him! Get him! Get him!
[03:07.820 --> 03:11.520]  I bought the outhouse DLC this morning.
[03:15.580 --> 03:16.760]  I'm coming for you, Geoff!
[03:16.760 --> 03:23.260]  Did Andrew do 60 fucking laps?
[03:23.620 --> 03:27.020]  Wait, why did you put 60 laps? You doofus!
[03:27.780 --> 03:29.720]  God almighty, we don't got enough room.
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.140]  What an idiot. Why did we let him host anything?
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.100]  And also, it's the same course.
[03:36.740 --> 03:39.820]  I specifically said, can we do a different track?
[03:40.400 --> 03:40.520]  Yes.
[03:42.760 --> 03:43.660]  Like, why?
[03:43.820 --> 03:45.260]  Like, are you just new?
[03:45.260 --> 03:46.700]  Like, what's with you?
[03:47.220 --> 03:49.140]  It's your first fucking day?
[03:49.220 --> 03:51.420]  There's only one lap. Let's do more laps.
[03:51.700 --> 03:53.500]  I don't know who you're making fun of.
[03:53.700 --> 03:55.180]  You, you fucking dunce.
[03:55.560 --> 03:56.840]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[03:57.240 --> 03:59.200]  Just do more laps and change the course.
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.200]  Here's 60 in the same course.
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.900]  Cool, man. Almost halfway to great.
[04:04.260 --> 04:05.700]  Way to go, you fucking dunce.
[04:05.740 --> 04:07.040]  Are you out of your mind?
[04:07.040 --> 04:08.840]  God damn it.
[04:10.800 --> 04:12.800]  Oh, what the hell was that?
[04:22.240 --> 04:25.320]  It doesn't matter. None of this matters.
[04:25.720 --> 04:26.280]  What are you talking about?
[04:26.280 --> 04:27.400]  What do you mean none of it matters?
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.100]  60 fucking laps?
[04:29.920 --> 04:32.300]  There couldn't be more matters.
[04:32.640 --> 04:34.100]  You're a moron.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.120]  You think NASCAR?
[04:35.120 --> 04:37.520]  Get the fuck out of here, Gavin.
[04:38.040 --> 04:38.780]  No, I'm not.
[04:39.900 --> 04:41.620]  I can't laugh much more.
[04:42.500 --> 04:45.840]  Between the Olympic thing and this, I'm not going to make it through the day.
[04:46.100 --> 04:47.440]  We have a podcast to do.
[04:48.160 --> 04:49.200]  You're killing me.
[04:49.740 --> 04:51.440]  Retire. Everyone retire.
[04:51.700 --> 04:54.140]  No, no. We got 60 laps to do, Andrew.
[04:54.140 --> 04:57.720]  I already retired because you've been whining for the past 10 minutes.
[04:57.980 --> 04:59.500]  Apologize. Say you're sorry.
[04:59.780 --> 05:00.940]  No. No.
[05:01.700 --> 05:02.760]  Apologize right now.
[05:03.160 --> 05:03.520]  No.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.920]  Say you're sorry for putting it on 60.
[05:06.280 --> 05:08.740]  I'm sorry. You're such a crybaby, Eric.
[05:08.800 --> 05:10.480]  Say you're sorry for putting it on 60.
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.040]  I'm not at all sorry.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.040]  That's all you have to say.
[05:14.140 --> 05:15.860]  Say you're sorry for picking the same course.
[05:16.420 --> 05:17.760]  Let me ask you a question.
[05:17.800 --> 05:19.580]  Say you're sorry for picking the same course.
[05:20.020 --> 05:21.360]  You want me to lie to your face?
[05:21.380 --> 05:24.340]  You don't have to mean it.
[05:24.460 --> 05:25.360]  I just want to hear it.
[05:26.100 --> 05:26.900]  Eric, I'm sorry.
[05:28.480 --> 05:29.380]  We'll go ahead and retire.
[05:29.380 --> 05:29.860]  That's all I needed.
[05:30.660 --> 05:31.700]  I'm sorry about that.
[05:31.740 --> 05:33.480]  That's it.
[05:37.200 --> 05:40.140]  Geoff's out here picking a different car and I'm getting all this heat.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.180]  Oh, not enough laps. Too many laps.
[05:43.840 --> 05:45.420]  You've already apologized.
[05:45.660 --> 05:46.960]  You've already apologized. I feel fine.
[05:47.520 --> 05:48.120]  Oh, my God.
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.820]  Guys, I'm sorry I picked a different car.
[05:53.020 --> 05:56.360]  I just paid money for it and I had to use it.
[05:56.620 --> 05:57.380]  It was great.
[05:57.380 --> 05:58.900]  Yeah, I think you're great.
[05:59.780 --> 06:00.960]  Should we do one with...
[06:01.500 --> 06:01.900]  Okay.
[06:02.520 --> 06:04.060]  I'm changing the race.
[06:05.240 --> 06:06.380]  Too many laps.
[06:06.640 --> 06:07.760]  Should we do one with real cars?
[06:08.880 --> 06:10.600]  Yeah, after this one, let's do one with real cars.
[06:10.600 --> 06:12.580]  I would argue we haven't done one with fake cars.
[06:12.980 --> 06:15.840]  Yeah, I want to do one with the sofa car all the way.
[06:16.960 --> 06:19.500]  Geoff is again picking not the regulation car.
[06:19.900 --> 06:20.880]  I'm a bumper car.
[06:21.280 --> 06:21.720]  That's fine.
[06:22.100 --> 06:25.400]  You spent money on the DLC and I know you're excited about it.
[06:25.400 --> 06:27.420]  Is three laps adequate?
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.900]  I think that's phenomenal.
[06:30.280 --> 06:31.100]  That's awesome.
[06:31.100 --> 06:32.280]  That's Mario Kart rules. That's great.
[06:32.400 --> 06:33.800]  Yeah, I think that totally makes sense.
[06:34.340 --> 06:36.640]  Holy shit, dude.
[06:37.100 --> 06:37.760]  Readying up.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.000]  Alright, let's do this thing.
[06:41.140 --> 06:42.440]  Our first race of the day.
[06:43.080 --> 06:43.760]  Here we go.
[06:45.480 --> 06:46.440]  Great races.
[06:48.420 --> 06:52.020]  Whoever wins this gets a gold for their country.
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.240]  Man, I feel like I just ran a marathon.
[06:56.480 --> 06:57.840]  Oh, it's ramps.
[06:57.940 --> 06:59.120]  Oh, shit.
[06:59.420 --> 07:00.720]  Oh my god.
[07:00.860 --> 07:03.640]  You killed me.
[07:03.640 --> 07:04.340]  Oh my god.
[07:05.100 --> 07:07.460]  That was very funny to watch.
[07:07.780 --> 07:08.460]  Oh my god.
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.240]  I full died there.
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.240]  Geoff!
[07:14.660 --> 07:16.020]  Me and Geoff are in the front.
[07:16.060 --> 07:16.420]  No!
[07:17.020 --> 07:18.260]  Oh my god.
[07:18.260 --> 07:21.860]  Oh my god.
[07:21.860 --> 07:23.700]  Oh my god.
[07:24.060 --> 07:24.480]  Oh my god.
[07:24.480 --> 07:24.920]  I flew.
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.340]  That was crazy.
[07:27.640 --> 07:30.260]  I killed Eric just by tapping the back of his couch.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.040]  Andrew, get off my ass.
[07:33.460 --> 07:34.660]  I'm getting off.
[07:35.180 --> 07:36.360]  Oh, shit.
[07:39.320 --> 07:39.920]  Ah, shit.
[07:42.480 --> 07:44.180]  You made one mistake.
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.140]  Yeah, you made one mistake.
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.280]  Geoff, one mistake.
[07:47.820 --> 07:48.560]  Oh, no!
[07:48.800 --> 07:50.740]  How did that hurt both of us?
[07:50.740 --> 07:56.120]  The good thing about spinning out on a hairpin turn is that you know the guy behind you is going to do it too.
[07:56.280 --> 07:56.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.320]  Because the brake does nothing.
[08:00.580 --> 08:01.460]  Left trigger brakes.
[08:05.220 --> 08:06.240]  Oh, it did that time.
[08:06.420 --> 08:07.800]  Oh, no!
[08:08.100 --> 08:09.140]  Oh, balls.
[08:09.960 --> 08:13.740]  Y'all talking about how B doesn't do anything, but I fucking flip around like an ant.
[08:13.820 --> 08:14.800]  I'm scared to use it.
[08:16.480 --> 08:18.200]  I hit Nick so hard.
[08:18.480 --> 08:19.620]  This is lap one still.
[08:19.780 --> 08:21.600]  This is a long-ass course.
[08:21.720 --> 08:22.020]  Oh, no.
[08:23.100 --> 08:25.200]  The course is perfect, so I'm going to catch up to Geoff.
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.300]  I didn't say it was too long. I didn't say it was too long at all.
[08:27.320 --> 08:28.120]  I just said it was long.
[08:29.060 --> 08:30.700]  That's an observation, not a criticism.
[08:30.960 --> 08:31.580]  Jesus Christ.
[08:32.660 --> 08:34.020]  Don't fucking Eric me.
[08:37.720 --> 08:38.700]  I'm losing Gavin.
[08:39.180 --> 08:39.920]  Got him.
[08:42.140 --> 08:42.740]  Got Geoff.
[08:43.620 --> 08:44.420]  First place.
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.160]  Oh, I flew into the crowd.
[08:50.200 --> 08:56.120]  I wonder if anybody in a race has ever flown into the crowd and then into a seat like they're sitting next to the people.
[08:58.200 --> 08:58.600]  Perfectly.
[08:59.340 --> 09:01.620]  Oh, shit. Who's on my tail? Is that Geoff?
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.640]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[09:05.740 --> 09:06.740]  Oh, wow, dude.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.520]  You looked like a shirk in there for a second.
[09:10.520 --> 09:14.560]  I couldn't pick which ramp to go off of, so I went off the middle, which was wrong.
[09:14.940 --> 09:15.940]  Yeah, that's incorrect, sir.
[09:17.740 --> 09:18.700]  Oh, oh.
[09:19.260 --> 09:21.840]  Man, I'm so far behind. This sucks.
[09:21.980 --> 09:22.420]  Is that Nick?
[09:23.040 --> 09:23.920]  Andrew, no!
[09:24.820 --> 09:25.780]  Oh, fuck.
[09:27.260 --> 09:28.220]  Oh, God.
[09:28.820 --> 09:30.240]  What's your problem, Gavin?
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.060]  I just keep crashing.
[09:32.960 --> 09:33.560]  That is deep.
[09:34.380 --> 09:39.560]  We recorded, now that we're racing, I'm reminded, we recorded some GTA races, right?
[09:39.560 --> 09:41.280]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[09:41.600 --> 09:43.340]  And we did Deadline, as well.
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.560]  None of that's come out, though, right?
[09:45.620 --> 09:46.420]  Not yet.
[09:46.940 --> 09:48.060]  And we did some heists.
[09:49.500 --> 09:51.060]  It's so cool, the backlog.
[09:52.240 --> 09:54.340]  Yeah, I'm really excited for that stuff to come out.
[09:54.660 --> 09:55.880]  Gavin, you killed us.
[09:56.640 --> 09:59.180]  Y'all gotta finish filming this heist.
[09:59.280 --> 10:00.200]  You got a couple more left, right?
[10:00.220 --> 10:01.060]  Yeah, we're almost done.
[10:01.440 --> 10:02.860]  I think we got one more, then we're good.
[10:03.560 --> 10:06.120]  We got one in that... I'm down.
[10:07.120 --> 10:07.400]  I'm down.
[10:08.060 --> 10:10.180]  No, it doesn't work for you. You're out Friday, Eric.
[10:11.320 --> 10:12.180]  Doesn't work for you.
[10:13.000 --> 10:13.680]  Let me be you.
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.620]  Eric doesn't know where he is this week.
[10:16.860 --> 10:18.020]  My week's been bad.
[10:18.100 --> 10:19.060]  It's been a very bad week.
[10:21.020 --> 10:21.900]  How do I boost?
[10:22.120 --> 10:23.480]  Oh, no!
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.480]  It's a real simple racer, man.
[10:28.600 --> 10:29.780]  It really is just three buttons.
[10:31.820 --> 10:33.620]  Oh, Nick is with me.
[10:33.780 --> 10:34.980]  I see you in my rear view.
[10:34.980 --> 10:36.860]  You son of a bitch, Andrew!
[10:38.040 --> 10:38.600]  Is this right?
[10:38.640 --> 10:40.700]  Am I really 30 seconds behind Geoff?
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.300]  That sounds right.
[10:43.700 --> 10:47.300]  I'm five seconds behind Geoff, and he's way in front of me.
[10:50.360 --> 10:51.300]  Crash him out.
[10:51.880 --> 10:52.400]  I'm trying.
[10:54.520 --> 10:55.740]  He doesn't want to.
[10:57.020 --> 10:57.980]  Oh, shit.
[10:59.620 --> 11:00.620]  Oh, my God!
[11:01.040 --> 11:02.340]  Gavin flew over me.
[11:02.960 --> 11:03.640]  Oh, no!
[11:03.840 --> 11:06.000]  Half of my couch came off.
[11:08.200 --> 11:08.680]  Really?
[11:09.300 --> 11:09.780]  Yeah.
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.600]  Whatever the big fucking exhaust things are,
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.800]  one of them came right off.
[11:15.480 --> 11:15.920]  Oh, dear.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.580]  That's such a funny gag.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.140]  You remember in the Dark Knight
[11:19.140 --> 11:21.240]  when the Batmobile turned into a motorbike?
[11:21.380 --> 11:23.380]  Like, if this just turns into a loveseat,
[11:23.600 --> 11:25.040]  he's a lazy boy.
[11:25.200 --> 11:27.380]  He just attacks half the couch.
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.420]  You know what a fun race might be to do
[11:30.420 --> 11:32.100]  would be to do school buses.
[11:33.040 --> 11:34.600]  Oh, dude, hell yeah.
[11:34.700 --> 11:36.260]  I had to do a race earlier
[11:36.260 --> 11:38.140]  where I was like a little three-wheel car
[11:38.140 --> 11:40.260]  against, and everybody else was a school bus,
[11:40.420 --> 11:42.620]  and those school buses were fucking slamming
[11:42.620 --> 11:44.760]  into each other and flipping, and it was cool.
[11:45.840 --> 11:46.180]  I hear,
[11:46.360 --> 11:48.520]  I had to do a race earlier, and then I look
[11:48.520 --> 11:50.780]  at the top left and see Geoff's 41 seconds
[11:50.780 --> 11:52.760]  ahead of me, and I wonder why.
[11:54.600 --> 11:56.200]  Who can explain this?
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.140]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[12:00.160 --> 12:00.780]  I'm bad
[12:00.780 --> 12:02.280]  at video games, and then if I'm good
[12:02.280 --> 12:03.880]  at a video game, I get criticized.
[12:04.140 --> 12:06.140]  This is fucking bad.
[12:06.400 --> 12:08.100]  He won? You won?
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.220]  Yeah, I got second. I didn't even know if I was on the
[12:10.220 --> 12:10.980]  third lap or not.
[12:12.560 --> 12:14.300]  I'm gonna spectate. Oh, I'm spectating
[12:14.300 --> 12:16.240]  Gavin, I think. Yeah. Hell yeah.
[12:16.440 --> 12:18.340]  You got it, Gavin. Let's go. You look cool, dude.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.720]  Let's go. You look great.
[12:20.140 --> 12:21.680]  Let's go. Gavin is a menace.
[12:21.680 --> 12:23.340]  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
[12:25.900 --> 12:27.860]  What? I'm out?
[12:28.360 --> 12:28.620]  Ah!
[12:29.540 --> 12:35.380]  Ah! Why didn't I finish?
[12:35.640 --> 12:37.320]  Did I wreck? Oh, Nick fucking
[12:37.320 --> 12:37.980]  died.
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.240]  I... I...
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.740]  I DNF'd. Oh, really?
[12:43.020 --> 12:45.260]  Oh, Gavin! Oh, shit. Nick's dead.
[12:45.620 --> 12:47.340]  The back of a ramp. I'm dead.
[12:48.340 --> 12:49.500]  Nick is dead.
[12:49.520 --> 12:50.560]  I died. That's awesome.
[12:51.600 --> 12:52.260]  Where is he?
[12:52.260 --> 12:52.820]  Fuck you, Nick.
[12:53.860 --> 12:55.280]  My corpse is in the audience.
[12:57.040 --> 12:58.140]  Fuck your couch, Nick.
[12:59.760 --> 13:00.360]  DNF?
[13:00.480 --> 13:02.540]  What the? Fourth place?
[13:03.740 --> 13:04.560]  He's so
[13:04.560 --> 13:06.400]  happy. What a
[13:06.400 --> 13:08.220]  load of horse shit. I'm ready.
[13:08.740 --> 13:10.420]  Mud... Mud Oval
[13:10.420 --> 13:12.100]  Banger Race. Holy
[13:12.100 --> 13:14.120]  shit. Oh, God. Here we go.
[13:15.220 --> 13:15.560]  Ah!
[13:15.960 --> 13:18.140]  Oh, my God! Why did you do nothing
[13:18.140 --> 13:18.600]  right?
[13:18.600 --> 13:19.340]  Here we go!
[13:21.220 --> 13:22.560]  Yeah. Geoff, don't do it.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.800]  Geoff. See?
[13:23.900 --> 13:26.660]  If Geoff hadn't played last night
[13:26.660 --> 13:28.960]  till 3am, we wouldn't know about this.
[13:31.060 --> 13:32.140]  Get off me, Geoff.
[13:32.700 --> 13:34.620]  I can't. I'm trying to get off.
[13:35.580 --> 13:36.120]  Yeah, he's trying.
[13:37.100 --> 13:37.820]  He's trying.
[13:39.780 --> 13:40.500]  Wow, that's a short
[13:40.500 --> 13:42.480]  map. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[13:43.260 --> 13:43.980]  Uh-oh. No!
[13:44.980 --> 13:45.420]  Holy shit.
[13:45.420 --> 13:45.740]  What the fuck?
[13:48.660 --> 13:49.140]  No!
[13:49.580 --> 13:50.700]  Ah, suck a dick, Geoff.
[13:51.600 --> 13:52.080]  No!
[13:53.200 --> 13:53.680]  Andrew!
[13:55.780 --> 13:57.600]  Suck my exhaust, Gavin.
[13:58.300 --> 13:59.800]  You're gonna get cancer.
[14:01.500 --> 14:03.480]  You may beat me today, but I'm gonna
[14:03.480 --> 14:05.380]  win the long game. What the fuck?
[14:05.420 --> 14:07.420]  No! Sorry, Eric. It had to be
[14:07.420 --> 14:07.880]  done.
[14:09.820 --> 14:10.780]  Oh, bitch!
[14:11.040 --> 14:11.720]  Oh, Gavin.
[14:11.720 --> 14:11.940]  Gavin.
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.340]  Damn it.
[14:18.420 --> 14:19.860]  I am the
[14:19.860 --> 14:21.200]  champion. Andrew wins.
[14:21.680 --> 14:23.220]  That was fun. My friends.
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.760]  I came in second. We should do one with
[14:25.760 --> 14:26.320]  ramps.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.860]  We should do one with ramps.
[14:29.980 --> 14:30.300]  Yeah.
[14:31.500 --> 14:33.620]  Oh, what the fuck?
[14:34.140 --> 14:36.000]  I don't know what this is, but this looks good.
[14:37.040 --> 14:37.540]  Hell yeah.
[14:38.940 --> 14:39.920]  Oh, little bumpies?
[14:39.920 --> 14:41.060]  I like little bumpies.
[14:41.340 --> 14:43.860]  Which way do we go?
[14:44.320 --> 14:45.500]  Oh god, what's happening?
[14:46.040 --> 14:47.400]  I'm going straight ahead.
[14:48.480 --> 14:49.260]  Hell ride!
[14:50.220 --> 14:51.460]  Hell ride, baby.
[14:51.880 --> 14:52.840]  What the fuck?
[14:53.280 --> 14:54.980]  Gavin, I can't see a damn thing.
[14:56.200 --> 14:57.500]  Is anyone else...
[14:57.500 --> 14:58.940]  What just happened to me?
[14:59.860 --> 15:01.860]  I also had extreme lag.
[15:02.420 --> 15:03.400]  That was crazy.
[15:03.680 --> 15:04.200]  That was terrible.
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.920]  Dude, that hell ride is noise.
[15:06.920 --> 15:09.060]  So you can just choose any direction
[15:09.060 --> 15:09.600]  to go.
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.780]  Oh my god.
[15:12.640 --> 15:13.940]  God, my rate.
[15:15.740 --> 15:17.020]  Hell ride!
[15:19.180 --> 15:20.360]  Oh my god.
[15:20.780 --> 15:21.720]  What is happening?
[15:23.820 --> 15:24.300]  Hey, Andrew.
[15:25.340 --> 15:26.760]  Yeah? Which way did you go?
[15:27.920 --> 15:28.700]  Oh no!
[15:29.340 --> 15:29.880]  No!
[15:30.780 --> 15:31.260]  No!
[15:31.260 --> 15:32.040]  Oh no!
[15:35.820 --> 15:37.040]  Damn this game.
[15:39.040 --> 15:40.380]  Are you having trouble still?
[15:40.840 --> 15:43.560]  Every time I crash, I get like one frame a second.
[15:43.720 --> 15:45.000]  Yeah, me too.
[15:45.120 --> 15:45.720]  Don't crash.
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.160]  Yeah, don't crash.
[15:51.380 --> 15:53.140]  No! Holy shit!
[15:54.160 --> 15:55.980]  How are you still alive?
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.700]  No, what the fuck?
[15:58.700 --> 16:00.920]  Oh shit!
[16:01.400 --> 16:01.820]  Oh balls!
[16:04.900 --> 16:05.680]  Oh my god.
[16:06.620 --> 16:07.980]  Oh no!
[16:08.220 --> 16:09.020]  Oh, I tilted.
[16:09.400 --> 16:11.000]  That actually helped me, thank you.
[16:12.060 --> 16:12.640]  Oh no!
[16:13.480 --> 16:15.080]  Straight as a hell.
[16:15.260 --> 16:16.960]  I'm going too fast to reset.
[16:18.060 --> 16:18.480]  Get him, Gavin.
[16:18.700 --> 16:21.000]  Oh my god!
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.760]  That was some fucking bus air right there.
[16:26.660 --> 16:27.100]  Boom!
[16:29.200 --> 16:31.660]  I will not move!
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.940]  Don't you guys do this?
[16:36.220 --> 16:36.600]  Whoa!
[16:38.240 --> 16:40.260]  Geoff went around, I didn't think there was any fucking shot.
[16:40.260 --> 16:41.600]  I didn't think he could do it.
[16:41.680 --> 16:43.180]  Dude, I can't believe.
[16:43.460 --> 16:44.820]  I can't believe you made that.
[16:46.060 --> 16:47.120]  I'm like, this is great.
[16:47.400 --> 16:49.060]  I'll get with Nick,
[16:49.340 --> 16:51.500]  T-Bone will get in your way, and you're fucked.
[16:52.040 --> 16:53.940]  Yeah, and that did not happen.
[16:53.940 --> 16:56.080]  I don't have any upgrades
[16:56.080 --> 16:57.760]  on this bus, it's the same one y'all have.
[16:58.060 --> 16:59.640]  When the audience comes at me for
[16:59.640 --> 17:00.820]  having played before.
[17:02.260 --> 17:03.340]  Oh my god.
[17:06.980 --> 17:07.700]  Damn it!
[17:07.980 --> 17:09.600]  How did we both miss Geoff?
[17:09.820 --> 17:11.020]  How did we both miss him?
[17:13.660 --> 17:15.200]  Don't hit anyone, don't hit anyone.
[17:19.700 --> 17:21.400]  I'm in a bad way, I'm in a bad way!
[17:21.400 --> 17:22.320]  I'm in a bad way!
[17:26.880 --> 17:28.700]  Oh, thanks Nick.
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.020]  Oh, you're welcome.
[17:30.780 --> 17:32.200]  Oh my god, I'm struggling.
[17:32.580 --> 17:34.640]  Oh my god, the frames, the frames!
[17:35.760 --> 17:37.220]  Are fine, are fine.
[17:37.360 --> 17:39.940]  I'm 36 seconds behind Geoff.
[17:41.220 --> 17:43.080]  Dude, don't even start with me.
[17:43.220 --> 17:43.360]  Oh!
[17:44.520 --> 17:47.900]  I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that's how much I fucked up.
[17:48.020 --> 17:49.620]  No, I was saying that to the idiot who hit me.
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.780]  That's a finished one.
[17:51.040 --> 17:52.560]  Oh shit!
[17:52.980 --> 17:54.380]  Oh my god, it's a pileup!
[17:55.720 --> 17:57.920]  I'd like to see when you can crash into people.
[17:58.740 --> 18:00.920]  Andrew, you're in fourth though, where's Nick?
[18:02.540 --> 18:03.520]  Dude, he's a
[18:03.520 --> 18:04.780]  minute 18 behind.
[18:04.940 --> 18:06.740]  I don't even know how that's possible.
[18:08.060 --> 18:08.400]  Stop!
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.160]  I didn't finish.
[18:12.180 --> 18:13.060]  He crashed.
[18:13.140 --> 18:14.100]  There we go, I did it.
[18:14.840 --> 18:16.000]  God damn, third place.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.940]  I think I could see
[18:17.940 --> 18:19.620]  30 seconds of gameplay.
[18:19.800 --> 18:21.540]  Andrew has no health.
[18:21.860 --> 18:22.900]  What the fuck was that?
[18:23.180 --> 18:24.080]  What'd you do?
[18:26.680 --> 18:28.060]  You didn't have
[18:28.060 --> 18:28.900]  any health.
[18:30.100 --> 18:31.780]  Let's see if I can set up a proper
[18:31.780 --> 18:32.620]  demolition.
[18:33.120 --> 18:36.100]  Dude, this is fun.
[18:37.480 --> 18:40.900]  Oh, you and I, Eric.
[18:41.580 --> 18:42.280]  And Geoff.
[18:42.280 --> 18:43.260]  No, Nick!
[18:44.220 --> 18:45.480]  Oh my god!
[18:46.560 --> 18:47.320]  Geoff died.
[18:48.020 --> 18:50.720]  I took some damage.
[18:51.440 --> 18:53.840]  Oh, Gavin!
[18:57.420 --> 18:59.940]  The body physics when you smash into someone
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.440]  is so funny.
[19:01.020 --> 19:01.920]  Minus one health.
[19:03.160 --> 19:04.300]  Every little bit counts.
[19:05.300 --> 19:07.720]  Oh, I didn't think my car would take damage if I wasn't on it.
[19:07.920 --> 19:08.600]  Oh, it does.
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.940]  So this is
[19:11.940 --> 19:12.760]  last man standing?
[19:13.160 --> 19:13.260]  Yeah.
[19:14.160 --> 19:14.840]  Oh!
[19:16.580 --> 19:17.860]  Geoff, no!
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.300]  Oh my god!
[19:23.300 --> 19:24.400]  How has Nick got
[19:24.400 --> 19:25.360]  full health?
[19:26.440 --> 19:27.400]  Nobody's hit him.
[19:29.300 --> 19:30.240]  Dogpile on Nick.
[19:30.240 --> 19:30.860]  Trying to hit anybody.
[19:32.780 --> 19:33.240]  Whoa!
[19:34.380 --> 19:35.000]  How was that?
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.500]  Geoff got...
[19:36.500 --> 19:37.960]  Dude, Nick, you got fucked.
[19:38.320 --> 19:40.320]  I got annihilated, son.
[19:44.420 --> 19:45.080]  Oh!
[19:48.960 --> 19:49.080]  Hello!
[19:50.540 --> 19:51.580]  Oh, I felt that.
[19:53.240 --> 19:54.420]  Oh, there! Oh my god!
[19:54.880 --> 19:55.520]  There we go.
[19:55.880 --> 19:57.480]  Here we go!
[19:57.960 --> 20:00.280]  Oh! Boom!
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.520]  How'd you live?
[20:08.120 --> 20:08.820]  Take that!
[20:09.060 --> 20:09.820]  Every time I crash,
[20:09.880 --> 20:10.520]  I go flying.
[20:10.660 --> 20:11.560]  How do you hold on?
[20:13.220 --> 20:15.080]  Whoever's going faster wins.
[20:15.760 --> 20:16.740]  Oh, shit!
[20:19.460 --> 20:19.940]  Boom!
[20:20.940 --> 20:21.600]  Uh-oh, Gavin!
[20:21.840 --> 20:23.280]  Oh my god, Gavin's on fire!
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.240]  Get him!
[20:26.440 --> 20:27.960]  How the fuck did I get hit?
[20:28.860 --> 20:30.100]  I got crunch rocket now.
[20:30.520 --> 20:31.320]  Oh no!
[20:31.320 --> 20:32.640]  Oh my god!
[20:35.060 --> 20:36.720]  Oh, that was so funny.
[20:39.480 --> 20:40.480]  You wish.
[20:40.840 --> 20:42.280]  Oh, I'm coming for you, big dog.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.120]  I'm hitting all the tires.
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.580]  Where's the fire extinguisher?
[20:49.060 --> 20:50.860]  Gavin's a fucking flaming muscle.
[20:52.060 --> 20:53.120]  I'm gonna put you out.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.660]  Oh my god, I just missed you.
[20:55.860 --> 20:56.400]  Oh, Andrew.
[20:57.300 --> 20:57.720]  Nick!
[21:00.780 --> 21:02.280]  I've got one health.
[21:02.460 --> 21:03.140]  Boom!
[21:03.640 --> 21:03.820]  No!
[21:05.980 --> 21:07.760]  I just have to dodge everyone
[21:07.760 --> 21:08.660]  for the rest of the round.
[21:09.520 --> 21:10.120]  Boom!
[21:11.440 --> 21:14.120]  Oh no, I'm at critical damage.
[21:17.560 --> 21:18.640]  Take that!
[21:18.900 --> 21:19.700]  Boom, Geoff.
[21:21.460 --> 21:22.600]  I killed Gavin.
[21:23.540 --> 21:25.980]  Oh yeah, I'm done. I got seven health.
[21:26.520 --> 21:27.880]  Oh, what a load of horse shit.
[21:30.140 --> 21:32.100]  Can you look for my keys while you're down there
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.040]  on the ground in the mud?
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.020]  Where's Gavin?
[21:35.820 --> 21:36.840]  I killed him.
[21:37.240 --> 21:38.040]  Oh, Gavin, are you out?
[21:39.680 --> 21:41.000]  Oh no, you're still talking.
[21:45.060 --> 21:46.120]  What a weird game
[21:46.120 --> 21:47.280]  to do, you're dead, you're dead.
[21:52.700 --> 21:54.140]  I was going faster.
[21:54.140 --> 21:56.920]  Oh, now that is horse shit.
[21:57.100 --> 21:57.480]  Boom!
[21:58.160 --> 21:59.440]  That killed me.
[21:59.820 --> 22:01.120]  That killed the fuck out of me.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.380]  Oh shit.
[22:04.080 --> 22:04.640]  Yes!
[22:11.380 --> 22:12.200]  Oh, Eric.
[22:12.700 --> 22:18.090]  I feel like
[22:19.330 --> 22:20.750]  something top heavy
[22:20.750 --> 22:21.770]  would be pretty fun here.
[22:22.470 --> 22:24.150]  Oh, he got me.
[22:24.550 --> 22:26.370]  I got rekt. I got third.
[22:27.190 --> 22:28.390]  Shit, where did he go?
[22:28.930 --> 22:30.470]  It's Andrew and Nick.
[22:31.150 --> 22:32.130]  Here we go.
[22:32.250 --> 22:33.010]  Bring it on, Nick.
[22:33.930 --> 22:35.730]  I'm a fiery boy, Andrew.
[22:37.110 --> 22:38.510]  Nick has lower
[22:38.510 --> 22:40.270]  health. Andrew just has
[22:40.270 --> 22:42.030]  barely a little bit more.
[22:43.930 --> 22:44.610]  Here comes Nick.
[22:44.870 --> 22:45.090]  Oh!
[22:45.770 --> 22:46.250]  Yeah!
[22:47.390 --> 22:49.490]  Wow. Damn.
[22:49.690 --> 22:50.670]  What a way to end it.
[22:51.250 --> 22:52.190]  That was great.
[22:52.190 --> 22:54.150]  Let's swap vehicles around.
[22:54.150 --> 22:55.370]  Yeah, definitely. Dude, this is
[22:55.970 --> 22:57.130]  fun with a bunch of people.
[22:57.590 --> 22:58.510]  What about Motorhome?
[22:59.990 --> 23:01.870]  You know what we should do
[23:01.870 --> 23:03.030]  with this fucking game?
[23:03.310 --> 23:05.490]  We should do a community event in this game.
[23:05.650 --> 23:06.870]  How many people can play?
[23:07.090 --> 23:09.530]  You can get up to 16 or 20 people or something.
[23:10.330 --> 23:11.210]  Hell yeah.
[23:11.870 --> 23:12.390]  Here we go, Geoff.
[23:14.250 --> 23:15.790]  So what's the other type you can do
[23:15.790 --> 23:16.970]  if it's not last man standing?
[23:17.790 --> 23:19.590]  Oh, it's deathmatch.
[23:19.590 --> 23:20.830]  Yeah, it's a deathmatch thing.
[23:22.190 --> 23:23.990]  Oh, I can't believe I missed you.
[23:24.390 --> 23:25.550]  Oh, I'm backing up.
[23:25.610 --> 23:27.170]  I can believe it. I'm just that good.
[23:29.850 --> 23:31.410]  Oh, you fucking
[23:31.410 --> 23:33.470]  dented me. Oh, I'm double dented.
[23:33.830 --> 23:35.630]  Oh, bitch. I wasted my
[23:35.630 --> 23:36.970]  boom on that. There was no boom.
[23:38.170 --> 23:39.150]  I said boom, but I didn't.
[23:39.230 --> 23:40.050]  You talking about chicken bakes?
[23:43.530 --> 23:44.330]  Oh, shit!
[23:44.730 --> 23:45.510]  Oh, you
[23:45.510 --> 23:46.630]  fucked up. Wow.
[23:46.630 --> 23:48.230]  My whole back
[23:49.270 --> 23:49.750]  half.
[23:51.670 --> 23:52.590]  Hey, Gavin.
[23:52.850 --> 23:54.490]  How does Gavin have like full health?
[23:55.810 --> 23:56.810]  Get him, get him,
[23:56.870 --> 23:57.730]  get him. Attack!
[23:59.450 --> 24:01.090]  Nick's doing that thing he did last time.
[24:02.010 --> 24:02.430]  Winning.
[24:03.370 --> 24:04.370]  Not me, Nick.
[24:04.730 --> 24:05.290]  Oh, shit.
[24:06.010 --> 24:08.630]  There we go. Hit him, hit him, smash him up against
[24:08.630 --> 24:10.650]  the wall and then continue to bash
[24:10.650 --> 24:11.910]  into him until he dies.
[24:13.530 --> 24:14.910]  Alright, floor it, floor it,
[24:14.910 --> 24:15.650]  floor it, floor it.
[24:25.370 --> 24:26.650]  Tip, get him.
[24:26.950 --> 24:27.190]  Attack!
[24:28.990 --> 24:29.830]  Get him.
[24:33.490 --> 24:38.350]  Yeah, remember me?
[24:39.210 --> 24:39.890]  Hey, buddy.
[24:41.530 --> 24:43.290]  Not me, I was just about to
[24:43.290 --> 24:44.790]  slam into the one that has health.
[24:47.330 --> 24:47.710]  Oh, yeah.
[24:50.310 --> 24:51.470]  This rocks.
[24:51.710 --> 24:52.750]  This is just a pile.
[24:53.310 --> 24:54.930]  My side went off.
[24:55.290 --> 24:56.510]  I've got just a skeleton.
[24:58.390 --> 24:59.330]  Oh, I'm in critical
[25:00.410 --> 25:00.990]  damage.
[25:01.450 --> 25:02.450]  I'm in critical damage.
[25:05.150 --> 25:06.070]  Nice hit.
[25:06.350 --> 25:07.410]  Nice hit.
[25:10.530 --> 25:12.470]  Do we both miss Andrew?
[25:12.710 --> 25:14.110]  Oh, no. I'm out.
[25:14.110 --> 25:15.310]  Get the fuck out of here.
[25:15.550 --> 25:16.310]  I'm out.
[25:17.430 --> 25:18.490]  Take that, Geoff.
[25:19.770 --> 25:21.770]  I'm coming for you, Nick.
[25:22.170 --> 25:22.710]  No!
[25:26.290 --> 25:27.990]  Oh, no. Critical.
[25:28.970 --> 25:30.230]  I'm in critical as well.
[25:31.670 --> 25:33.630]  Oh, we got a piece of Nick there.
[25:34.930 --> 25:36.390]  Andrew with one bar of health
[25:36.390 --> 25:38.170]  left, Geoff with almost two,
[25:38.590 --> 25:40.230]  Nick with two and a half bars,
[25:40.370 --> 25:41.910]  and Gavin is out.
[25:41.910 --> 25:42.270]  Damn it.
[25:42.750 --> 25:44.550]  I must kill you.
[25:45.610 --> 25:46.730]  Oh, Nick.
[25:48.130 --> 25:51.390]  Alright, come in. I got him sewn up.
[25:51.490 --> 25:52.270]  Andrew, come get him.
[25:52.750 --> 25:53.730]  I'm looping around.
[25:55.470 --> 25:57.210]  Nick has to get out of there.
[25:57.370 --> 25:59.330]  He has the most health of anyone.
[25:59.950 --> 26:01.670]  Geoff chasing him down.
[26:02.090 --> 26:02.990]  Andrew misses.
[26:05.470 --> 26:07.210]  I'm charging it up, Geoff.
[26:07.370 --> 26:09.050]  Here comes Andrew. No one home.
[26:09.050 --> 26:10.610]  Oh, no. I'm charging it.
[26:11.210 --> 26:13.170]  Geoff right on Nick's tail.
[26:13.390 --> 26:15.310]  Oh, he sure is. There it is.
[26:16.410 --> 26:17.270]  Spun out.
[26:17.730 --> 26:18.010]  Oh, no.
[26:18.430 --> 26:18.770]  I hear him.
[26:19.730 --> 26:21.450]  I'm trying to help you, Geoff.
[26:22.630 --> 26:24.210]  You had to go, too, at some point.
[26:24.390 --> 26:25.170]  I had to take the shot.
[26:27.090 --> 26:29.410]  Geoff only needs one more hit.
[26:29.970 --> 26:31.230]  If Geoff gets hit one more time,
[26:31.290 --> 26:32.770]  he's done. He's on fire
[26:32.770 --> 26:34.010]  with nothing left.
[26:34.950 --> 26:36.970]  Nick almost into that wall.
[26:36.970 --> 26:38.310]  Yep, yep, yep.
[26:38.490 --> 26:39.910]  He's going to take himself out.
[26:40.970 --> 26:42.450]  There it is.
[26:43.290 --> 26:44.710]  What a slam.
[26:45.390 --> 26:46.430]  What a finish.
[26:49.370 --> 26:50.330]  This rocks.
[26:50.950 --> 26:51.950]  This is so fun.
[26:52.490 --> 26:54.810]  We could also adjust, and I don't know
[26:54.810 --> 26:56.950]  what it means, but we can make
[26:57.810 --> 26:58.290]  damage
[26:58.950 --> 27:01.110]  be normal, intense, or realistic.
[27:01.870 --> 27:02.370]  Should we do
[27:02.950 --> 27:03.430]  realistic?
[27:04.310 --> 27:05.350]  Or extreme?
[27:05.750 --> 27:06.790]  What is it on right now?
[27:07.590 --> 27:08.050]  Normal.
[27:09.410 --> 27:11.330]  Let's do realistic, and let's do lawnmowers.
[27:12.270 --> 27:13.010]  At a death match.
[27:13.850 --> 27:14.790]  Did we already do lawnmowers?
[27:14.990 --> 27:16.090]  We did lawnmowers.
[27:16.950 --> 27:18.130]  We should do something big.
[27:18.390 --> 27:19.510]  Let's do sofas.
[27:20.350 --> 27:22.970]  We haven't done a couch demolition.
[27:23.230 --> 27:23.830]  Let's do that.
[27:24.610 --> 27:26.510]  Let me set unready. Sorry.
[27:26.770 --> 27:28.050]  I'm going to take my upgrade off.
[27:29.530 --> 27:30.190]  It's fine.
[27:30.190 --> 27:30.810]  Wow.
[27:31.330 --> 27:33.610]  You cheated again. That's okay.
[27:34.830 --> 27:35.650]  Boom!
[27:36.110 --> 27:37.110]  Oh my God!
[27:42.210 --> 27:44.830]  This is realistic damage.
[27:45.130 --> 27:45.350]  I'm going so high.
[27:45.910 --> 27:47.190]  Bye, Nick.
[27:49.710 --> 27:51.230]  I'm doing a wheelie!
[27:51.820 --> 27:54.410]  You're bombing a wheelie. That was amazing.
[27:55.090 --> 27:55.890]  Oh!
[28:00.630 --> 28:01.470]  Oh no!
[28:01.690 --> 28:04.310]  Oh, I got sandwiched!
[28:06.910 --> 28:07.890]  Come and get him!
[28:09.850 --> 28:10.410]  Oh!
[28:12.270 --> 28:13.210]  Got me.
[28:14.810 --> 28:15.630]  Oh, wheel out!
[28:15.830 --> 28:16.810]  Wheel out!
[28:19.350 --> 28:21.150]  I got to get out of here.
[28:21.630 --> 28:23.190]  I got to get out of here.
[28:23.810 --> 28:26.270]  It's Andrew. Don't worry, I untipped him.
[28:26.890 --> 28:27.730]  Oh no!
[28:27.730 --> 28:28.170]  Oh no!
[28:33.530 --> 28:36.150]  There you go, Nick.
[28:37.310 --> 28:38.090]  I'm going to die.
[28:38.750 --> 28:39.630]  Oh no!
[28:40.030 --> 28:41.950]  I want in on this.
[28:42.250 --> 28:43.670]  Oh no, I missed everybody.
[28:43.970 --> 28:45.050]  Come on, Geoff.
[28:47.630 --> 28:48.370]  Oh no!
[28:50.270 --> 28:51.370]  You duped me.
[28:52.330 --> 28:53.330]  That was terrifying.
[28:53.930 --> 28:55.490]  Full health, everybody.
[28:55.730 --> 28:55.970]  Yeah.
[28:57.910 --> 28:58.990]  Oh, don't touch me!
[28:59.970 --> 29:01.210]  Somebody get Nick!
[29:01.770 --> 29:02.550]  Where is he?
[29:02.990 --> 29:04.610]  Oh, he recessed.
[29:05.070 --> 29:05.550]  Oh!
[29:07.170 --> 29:08.650]  Oh, Andrew!
[29:08.870 --> 29:09.950]  Oh no, I'm wrecked!
[29:13.260 --> 29:14.360]  I got a wreck.
[29:17.960 --> 29:18.420]  What's up, Geoff?
[29:18.880 --> 29:20.480]  Oh no, I'm wrecked.
[29:21.620 --> 29:23.480]  I wonder if this would be a good game for...
[29:23.480 --> 29:26.640]  Oh, that did not go well for me.
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.140]  Oh yeah.
[29:28.520 --> 29:30.060]  Oh, that's really funny, Nick.
[29:33.400 --> 29:35.540]  Gavin is at 65 health.
[29:36.760 --> 29:39.400]  Geoff is at 16 health.
[29:39.860 --> 29:40.540]  Oh my god!
[29:40.840 --> 29:42.260]  Oh, what a miss.
[29:44.760 --> 29:45.320]  Here comes Gavin.
[29:46.460 --> 29:47.540]  He's in cheetah mode.
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.380]  I'm a hungry cheetah.
[29:51.140 --> 29:52.200]  Gavin hurt himself.
[29:52.240 --> 29:53.220]  I'm going to get a bite of this.
[29:54.620 --> 29:55.740]  Bite my ass!
[29:55.920 --> 29:57.080]  Oh shit, I spun it!
[29:58.040 --> 29:58.980]  Get him, Geoff!
[30:00.020 --> 30:00.920]  Oh, he's vulnerable.
[30:01.740 --> 30:03.100]  They're behind each other.
[30:03.220 --> 30:03.840]  They don't know.
[30:07.740 --> 30:09.500]  He's got the cheetah in his sights.
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.100]  Oh no, they're spun out.
[30:11.700 --> 30:12.680]  Oh no, they're spun out.
[30:13.400 --> 30:14.760]  We're getting too excited.
[30:15.100 --> 30:15.940]  We keep spitting it out.
[30:16.680 --> 30:17.960]  I'm taking it all the way around.
[30:20.180 --> 30:22.580]  These things aren't made to be so maneuverable.
[30:22.580 --> 30:23.720]  Look out!
[30:23.800 --> 30:25.540]  We're trying to do advanced tactics.
[30:25.680 --> 30:29.940]  Instead of going the opposite direction,
[30:30.120 --> 30:31.760]  Geoff is deciding to follow Gavin.
[30:32.120 --> 30:34.600]  I think he's trying to trick him
[30:34.600 --> 30:36.240]  to run into the wall and hurt himself.
[30:36.580 --> 30:37.940]  It's not a bad strategy.
[30:39.160 --> 30:40.920]  It hurts itself and its confusion.
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.860]  And it's happened a couple of times.
[30:45.020 --> 30:46.700]  Gavin's down to 55 health now.
[30:48.320 --> 30:49.560]  Geoff's still at 16.
[30:50.920 --> 30:51.560]  Oh no!
[30:54.640 --> 30:55.580]  Geoff down to 10.
[30:56.500 --> 30:58.500]  You can keep running into his car.
[31:01.540 --> 31:03.180]  That was close.
[31:04.500 --> 31:06.120]  10 health for Geoff,
[31:06.300 --> 31:07.440]  50 health for Gavin.
[31:08.680 --> 31:09.940]  Gavin's spinning out.
[31:14.620 --> 31:17.700]  My only hope is to trick him into it.
[31:17.700 --> 31:18.260]  Yeah.
[31:22.120 --> 31:23.660]  You're down to 5 now.
[31:23.760 --> 31:24.520]  Gavin's at 45.
[31:25.380 --> 31:27.580]  One more hit and I think it's going to do it for Geoff.
[31:32.180 --> 31:34.160]  You went out like a champion, dude.
[31:37.240 --> 31:39.120]  You went out baller style.
[31:40.100 --> 31:41.340]  I sandwiched his ass.
[31:41.560 --> 31:43.660]  He's going to have to climb that fence to get back to his sofa.
[31:44.040 --> 31:44.800]  Alright, what are we thinking?
[31:44.800 --> 31:46.140]  Should we do it with cars?
[31:46.540 --> 31:47.900]  Yeah, let's do that.
[31:48.400 --> 31:50.080]  I'm so excited for the first wreck.
[31:52.700 --> 31:54.060]  Head on, Gavin.
[32:00.960 --> 32:02.380]  How about that, Nick?
[32:10.340 --> 32:12.060]  This is not...
[32:12.060 --> 32:14.540]  Dude, this is insane.
[32:14.940 --> 32:15.540]  This damage.
[32:16.320 --> 32:18.060]  Gavin, your car...
[32:18.940 --> 32:20.400]  Well, me and Gavin went head on.
[32:22.260 --> 32:23.660]  I'm making a tiny car.
[32:25.760 --> 32:27.660]  What? I'm out? What?
[32:28.400 --> 32:28.860]  Bullshit.
[32:29.780 --> 32:30.240]  Bye, Nick.
[32:30.760 --> 32:31.220]  How?
[32:33.320 --> 32:34.560]  How is he moving?
[32:34.560 --> 32:36.720]  Look at Geoff's car.
[32:40.040 --> 32:41.340]  I'm not doing so well.
[32:41.640 --> 32:43.140]  Look at your car.
[32:43.360 --> 32:45.760]  I think the car is keeping me alive.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.380]  I think you can't take me out.
[32:47.560 --> 32:49.000]  Or I'll fall into pieces.
[32:50.840 --> 32:52.480]  I glitched into the wall
[32:52.480 --> 32:53.740]  and it stole my tire.
[32:54.100 --> 32:55.380]  I'm missing a wheel.
[32:55.380 --> 32:57.360]  What did you do?
[33:01.540 --> 33:03.660]  Oh no!
[33:04.460 --> 33:06.480]  How am I still in this?
[33:06.760 --> 33:08.760]  How am I still in this?
[33:09.280 --> 33:11.400]  I'm a motorcycle.
[33:14.080 --> 33:17.540]  I'm a motorcycle.
[33:20.940 --> 33:22.400]  Kill me.
[33:22.400 --> 33:23.840]  Kill me.
[33:24.100 --> 33:26.520]  Shit, I hurt myself on a dead person.
[33:26.580 --> 33:27.440]  Let me die here.
[33:34.040 --> 33:35.840]  I finished first.
[33:36.280 --> 33:36.960]  You won?
[33:37.060 --> 33:38.120]  How did you win?
[33:38.160 --> 33:40.160]  There was nothing left of you.
[33:43.900 --> 33:45.300]  Oh, that rock.
[33:45.400 --> 33:46.920]  I think we have to do that with a bigger vehicle.
[33:47.720 --> 33:50.700]  Can we do that star beast?
[33:50.700 --> 33:51.900]  It's just two to the right.
[33:52.360 --> 33:53.340]  Yeah, let's do that.
[33:53.560 --> 33:55.700]  Who am I going head on with?
[33:55.880 --> 33:56.700]  Nick, Gavin.
[33:58.780 --> 34:00.260]  Let's fuck them up.
[34:00.520 --> 34:00.940]  Geoff!
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.100]  I've got to keep you guessing.
[34:07.780 --> 34:08.640]  Yeah, I'm guessing.
[34:11.940 --> 34:12.900]  I saw that coming.
[34:17.900 --> 34:19.600]  I want to get some speed going.
[34:19.600 --> 34:20.920]  Oh!
[34:21.360 --> 34:22.040]  No!
[34:22.520 --> 34:24.920]  Oh, you fucked me.
[34:25.400 --> 34:25.900]  Gavin!
[34:26.360 --> 34:28.900]  You crunched me.
[34:30.520 --> 34:32.340]  Oh, I think I saved you, Andrew.
[34:32.740 --> 34:34.140]  I think by slowing you down,
[34:34.240 --> 34:35.580]  I saved you.
[34:35.740 --> 34:37.240]  You really did.
[34:37.260 --> 34:40.780]  My guy.
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.500]  My physical body is all crunched up now.
[34:44.480 --> 34:45.440]  Your little stigma?
[34:45.640 --> 34:45.980]  Got him.
[34:45.980 --> 34:46.780]  Yeah.
[34:46.900 --> 34:48.880]  I'm all narrow.
[34:52.320 --> 34:53.420]  Head on!
[34:55.760 --> 34:57.180]  You're half a car again.
[35:00.740 --> 35:02.100]  Hang on tight.
[35:02.760 --> 35:05.080]  My gearbox is damaged.
[35:06.220 --> 35:07.640]  Oh, the both of you.
[35:07.760 --> 35:08.240]  Oh, shit.
[35:08.640 --> 35:10.000]  You're still alive.
[35:12.600 --> 35:13.820]  Oh, Andrew.
[35:14.440 --> 35:15.580]  Andrew's on fire.
[35:15.820 --> 35:17.020]  You're burning up.
[35:17.300 --> 35:17.840]  In fuego.
[35:19.420 --> 35:20.840]  Burning down the track.
[35:21.440 --> 35:23.800]  Nick! I'll kill you!
[35:24.440 --> 35:25.000]  That's what you think.
[35:26.080 --> 35:27.660]  Oh, God, I really am on fire.
[35:28.100 --> 35:28.740]  Oh, Gavin.
[35:28.980 --> 35:31.140]  Geoff, let me go.
[35:31.660 --> 35:32.380]  What are you going to do, you little bitch?
[35:33.160 --> 35:34.360]  I'm not going to reset.
[35:34.980 --> 35:36.820]  Eric, free me.
[35:37.420 --> 35:38.620]  I'm not going to get reset.
[35:39.500 --> 35:40.520]  Save me, Eric.
[35:40.520 --> 35:41.700]  Oh, God.
[35:42.620 --> 35:42.880]  Ow.
[35:44.220 --> 35:44.700]  Get him, Gavin.
[35:47.440 --> 35:49.980]  Andrew's man is like Ben.
[35:50.580 --> 35:52.620]  I'm Ben. I told you I'm all narrow.
[35:52.960 --> 35:53.900]  I'm all narrow.
[35:55.200 --> 35:56.260]  I've become a
[35:56.260 --> 35:57.020]  fucking
[35:58.420 --> 35:59.920]  crab. No, lobster.
[36:00.200 --> 36:00.660]  I don't know.
[36:01.420 --> 36:02.660]  How am I not out?
[36:04.240 --> 36:05.160]  Die, Andrew.
[36:06.300 --> 36:07.500]  I don't know how I'm not dead.
[36:07.500 --> 36:08.400]  How are you alive?
[36:09.460 --> 36:10.560]  I don't know.
[36:10.900 --> 36:11.680]  I'm all narrow.
[36:12.780 --> 36:15.520]  You can't make me more narrow. I'm already all narrow.
[36:17.960 --> 36:19.400]  You're like a perspective
[36:19.400 --> 36:20.200]  painting.
[36:25.660 --> 36:27.860]  I'm struggling to turn.
[36:28.320 --> 36:29.700]  I can't really turn anymore.
[36:31.760 --> 36:34.160]  I just came back. Eric, let me...
[36:34.160 --> 36:35.040]  Nick's on fire.
[36:35.580 --> 36:37.780]  Oh, I wrecked.
[36:37.780 --> 36:39.620]  Oh, I killed Eric by accident.
[36:41.520 --> 36:42.700]  I've got no traction.
[36:43.480 --> 36:46.020]  Let me help you with that, buddy.
[36:47.380 --> 36:49.580]  Andrew and Gavin neck and neck here.
[36:50.220 --> 36:52.000]  Nick is still in this thing somehow.
[36:52.240 --> 36:54.060]  He is just rear-wheel drive.
[36:55.020 --> 36:56.480]  Gavin is in his sights.
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.640]  Here comes Andrew.
[36:59.460 --> 37:00.880]  Andrew, on Nick's tail.
[37:01.440 --> 37:03.380]  Andrew, please.
[37:04.280 --> 37:04.860]  Please.
[37:04.860 --> 37:06.640]  No mercy, Nick.
[37:07.520 --> 37:07.820]  Andrew.
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.660]  You're on fire, Andrew.
[37:11.600 --> 37:13.500]  I'm going to light you on fire too.
[37:13.620 --> 37:14.740]  Let me die.
[37:15.280 --> 37:16.260]  Come on, Gavin. Get him.
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.200]  Where are you going to take him to, Andrew?
[37:19.880 --> 37:20.300]  Ah, shit.
[37:20.540 --> 37:21.360]  Andrew couldn't hang on.
[37:21.940 --> 37:23.480]  Gavin is just a tail.
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.720]  Gavin is just simply a little tail.
[37:27.860 --> 37:28.880]  Oh, Nick.
[37:31.780 --> 37:33.020]  Gavin, you may have saved me.
[37:33.020 --> 37:34.400]  Get caught.
[37:35.200 --> 37:36.400]  I've got to go around.
[37:36.700 --> 37:38.300]  It's getting critical for Nick.
[37:38.800 --> 37:40.340]  It is critical for Nick.
[37:40.700 --> 37:42.560]  I look like a partially flushed turd.
[37:45.180 --> 37:46.980]  Andrew is taking
[37:46.980 --> 37:48.600]  the big sweeping route.
[37:50.320 --> 37:51.540]  I'm coming to smash him.
[37:51.620 --> 37:52.420]  Oh, if I could turn...
[37:52.420 --> 37:52.580]  Gavin!
[37:54.960 --> 37:55.680]  Wow!
[37:56.620 --> 37:58.240]  What a smash!
[37:58.620 --> 38:01.180]  Smash of the day from Gavin.
[38:01.180 --> 38:02.500]  That was awesome.
[38:02.500 --> 38:03.940]  And Nick is back.
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.480]  He's on his feet.
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.560]  Here comes Andrew.
[38:08.800 --> 38:09.580]  No one home.
[38:10.580 --> 38:11.960]  Come on, Nick. What do you got?
[38:11.960 --> 38:13.040]  How am I so fast?
[38:14.440 --> 38:17.020]  Gavin looking really strong.
[38:17.160 --> 38:18.400]  Yeah, he's got this right here.
[38:20.820 --> 38:21.880]  Oh, here comes Andrew.
[38:22.020 --> 38:23.280]  Got him. No!
[38:23.820 --> 38:24.800]  I won!
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.180]  Nick won!
[38:29.540 --> 38:30.940]  I'm the tortoise, bitch!
[38:31.480 --> 38:33.200]  Dude, I think that's it.
[38:33.340 --> 38:34.200]  I think we did it.
[38:34.380 --> 38:35.720]  I think that's so fucking good.
[38:36.980 --> 38:39.060]  Dude, what a fucking game.
[38:39.200 --> 38:40.160]  That's funny shit.
[38:40.300 --> 38:42.040]  We got to play this with the community.
[38:42.920 --> 38:44.240]  We have to play this with the community.
[38:45.200 --> 38:45.980]  This is awesome.
[38:47.980 --> 38:48.440]  Guys,
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.720]  thanks for watching Wreckfest.
[38:52.300 --> 38:53.220]  This rocked.
[38:53.220 --> 38:54.800]  We want to play with you.
[38:55.880 --> 38:57.040]  Participate in the vote.
[38:57.320 --> 38:58.860]  Let us know in the comments
[38:58.860 --> 39:00.300]  how to best do that.
[39:00.460 --> 39:02.140]  We want to play with you guys on a game night.
[39:02.280 --> 39:03.200]  I think it will be a lot of fun.
[39:04.460 --> 39:05.620]  Voted to kick Nick.
[39:05.720 --> 39:06.600]  How do I vote for that?
[39:09.940 --> 39:11.020]  There we go.
[39:11.300 --> 39:11.960]  Okay, guys.
[39:12.360 --> 39:14.020]  Thank you so much for watching.
[39:14.380 --> 39:16.100]  We'll see you next time.
[39:17.200 --> 39:17.580]  Bye!
[39:18.260 --> 39:18.700]  Bye!
[39:18.700 --> 39:19.700]  Bye!
[39:20.380 --> 39:20.960]  Bye!
