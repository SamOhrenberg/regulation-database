[00:00.000 --> 00:05.060]  I'm just happy that Andrew's not here to stop us from going live today because he's always
[00:05.060 --> 00:10.980]  like, always just like, no, no, no, no, let's give those pleasantries to the audience. And
[00:10.980 --> 00:16.660]  he's like, I hate the audience. Five o'clock exactly. Four o'clock exactly. That's what
[00:16.660 --> 00:22.380]  Andrew says. I'm the nice one that now we're all, it's all coming together. It's all coming
[00:22.380 --> 00:26.660]  together. It was all a big facade. Yeah. There was some game that we played recently where
[00:26.660 --> 00:30.460]  I said that or I said, I'm the nice one. And it's, oh no, I think maybe it's the, uh,
[00:30.460 --> 00:33.860]  maybe it's like the dog run one or whatever, like the agility run. And I just said, I'm
[00:33.860 --> 00:37.480]  the nice one. And it's a bunch of comments going, what a bunch of bullshit. It's like,
[00:37.540 --> 00:44.360]  what do you think? Oh, come on, man. No, you're not. Yeah. It's yeah. It's that. It's very
[00:44.360 --> 00:51.340]  funny. I like it when you say that you're always right. Well, yeah, that's it's a, there, there's
[00:51.340 --> 01:01.220]  a reason for that. I am. I am. The numbers don't lie. I mean, my numbers don't lie, baby.
[01:01.740 --> 01:04.820]  You know what? I agree with you, Eric. Yeah. Numbers don't lie. Yeah. Oh, that's a bunch
[01:04.820 --> 01:08.760]  of piss rats in the chat. No, we want what? I think that's wrong. I think we want a bunch
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.240]  of corn cats. Actually. We want some hard piss rats right now. What? With that heavy
[01:14.240 --> 01:21.400]  hard piss rat rain. Who's recording the backup again? Geoff. I am. I got to go. Why is that?
[01:21.500 --> 01:25.580]  Is that OK? Oh, yeah, it's perfect. Oh, no. My squirrel. Do we need it now? Or did you
[01:25.580 --> 01:32.120]  fuck up? No. You said the way you say the way when you go up an octave. My wife says
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.580]  that's how she knows I'm full of shit. Yeah. And I'm starting to see what she means. Yeah.
[01:36.020 --> 01:39.700]  Why do you keep going away from the squirrel? OK, we're trying to figure out how to dump
[01:39.700 --> 01:44.040]  my own tail. It's just why? Hey, I think we should start at the windmill. Nick loves
[01:44.040 --> 01:48.460]  windmills. He's a windmill guy. I think this is it. I thought he hated windmills because
[01:48.460 --> 01:52.320]  they kill birds. Wasn't he saying that the other day? Is that what he says? Is that what
[01:52.320 --> 01:56.540]  he's been known to say? Welcome to the Friday stream. Hope you guys are doing well. We're
[01:56.540 --> 02:00.400]  in free play mode. I don't know what that means. What is this? We don't want to play
[02:00.400 --> 02:05.220]  free play mode, do we? What is this? I don't I don't want this. What is this? I don't know.
[02:05.220 --> 02:11.060]  Go back. Get out of this. What is this? We're going to need someone jump on the big red
[02:11.060 --> 02:17.200]  button like a fool. Yeah, probably one of you guys. Are you going to end the game at
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.240]  any point? Yeah. How do I do? I just got to save and share level because I don't want
[02:20.240 --> 02:27.920]  to do that. I got to quit. Return to treehouse. OK, good. God damn. This is why Andrew won't
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.820]  let us start early. Who who hit the red button? I don't know. It wasn't me. Party, party,
[02:33.820 --> 02:37.720]  right? All right. We got to go to windmill because Nick hates windmills. Yeah, I love
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.260]  windmills. He hates them. They kill birds. Guys, welcome to the Friday stream. It starts
[02:42.260 --> 02:50.140]  right now. The rest of it was Geoff. Hey, Geoff. Hi. It goes faster when you're in. OK, you
[02:50.140 --> 03:00.340]  could vote on a different level if you want. It's just in Wii U mode. God, dude, what the
[03:00.340 --> 03:05.020]  fuck? I'm just having fun. We had fun today. Do you guys remember how much fun we had already
[03:05.020 --> 03:10.200]  today together? I remember how much fun we had earlier. Yeah, it was fantastic. Yep.
[03:10.580 --> 03:15.660]  Audience, we had a lot of fun earlier today. Let me tell you, we did two drafts. Yeah, we
[03:15.660 --> 03:20.040]  yeah, they were really good. We've done four drafts in the last eight days, two weeks.
[03:20.300 --> 03:25.540]  Yeah, yeah. Really good. I think we had a pent up draftage. We did. We did. It's like
[03:25.540 --> 03:29.300]  when you don't draft for a couple of months and then you just you just fucking shoot draft
[03:29.300 --> 03:33.620]  so hard. What is playing this video game like? Is it fun? Oh, OK, I guess we're about to find
[03:33.620 --> 03:39.040]  out. Jesus Christ. Oh, I died. Cool. Did not know. Thanks, boys. All right, cool.
[03:41.730 --> 03:45.650]  OK. Oh, you punched me, you motherfucker.
[03:47.910 --> 03:49.450]  No. Yes, no.
[03:51.930 --> 03:54.590]  Whenever I go. Shut up.
[03:55.090 --> 03:59.870]  Come on with the gift. Oh, shit. So much. I got Eric. Oh, you moron.
[04:01.590 --> 04:04.230]  I got it. I got it. That was pretty funny.
[04:04.230 --> 04:07.270]  That's pretty clever. Oh, shit. What'd I grab?
[04:08.410 --> 04:12.730]  Don't know. We're going to find out. So should we do some clever draft promotion?
[04:12.970 --> 04:14.790]  Should we tease what we recorded?
[04:15.430 --> 04:17.410]  Well, we a bunch of teases. Yeah.
[04:18.910 --> 04:21.370]  OK, Geoff, it sounds like you have an idea. What do you want to tease?
[04:21.790 --> 04:28.930]  Yeah. Well, I will say that today we determined via draft and wheel what everybody's
[04:28.930 --> 04:31.970]  official nicknames for the year 2025 will be.
[04:32.330 --> 04:33.970]  It's true. Pretty excited about that.
[04:34.530 --> 04:41.770]  Me too. Well, also, we drafted we did a Gavin idea, sports improvements.
[04:41.850 --> 04:45.250]  Oh, no. Yes. We all died rat.
[04:45.870 --> 04:48.750]  We all got our heads together and figured out ways to make sports better.
[04:49.030 --> 04:51.350]  Well, I think we came up with some pretty, pretty amazing ideas.
[04:51.570 --> 04:52.910]  Yeah, that was that was really good.
[04:53.090 --> 04:54.550]  The nicknames one, I think, is great.
[04:55.030 --> 04:59.590]  Oh, did are we Nostradamus, which I believe comes out soon?
[05:00.110 --> 05:00.770]  What's a rocket do?
[05:01.050 --> 05:03.490]  Where we make our predictions for things that will happen in the year 2025.
[05:05.630 --> 05:07.730]  And we. What's a rocket do?
[05:09.090 --> 05:10.070]  The rocket rockets.
[05:10.490 --> 05:11.850]  Oh, who busted that up?
[05:12.150 --> 05:15.250]  Hey, well, now we can't reach the top.
[05:15.870 --> 05:18.570]  Not the rocket. No, no, no. Kill him.
[05:19.410 --> 05:20.310]  Oh, you put it there.
[05:21.170 --> 05:23.490]  You destroyed the. Oh, my God.
[05:24.210 --> 05:25.970]  You put it there. What do you want?
[05:27.070 --> 05:29.950]  Hmm. Just Geoff, are you just were you just like waiting?
[05:30.470 --> 05:32.050]  I was just watching you guys ride around the rocket.
[05:35.630 --> 05:36.430]  Oh, boy.
[05:37.830 --> 05:38.630]  Let's see.
[05:38.910 --> 05:40.990]  No, I didn't want that. I wanted the other thing.
[05:41.090 --> 05:42.410]  Damn it.
[05:44.150 --> 05:45.410]  What are you blowing up, Geoff?
[05:45.670 --> 05:46.890]  No, I don't know.
[05:47.490 --> 05:48.790]  Why? OK.
[05:49.250 --> 05:50.090]  Trying to make it harder.
[05:50.630 --> 05:50.990]  Here we go.
[05:53.130 --> 05:55.070]  Now we got it. Yeah.
[05:56.530 --> 05:59.470]  What? It started me under the level.
[06:00.010 --> 06:03.810]  Oh, no. It started me under the stage.
[06:05.130 --> 06:06.030]  Nick's on the rocket.
[06:07.590 --> 06:08.310]  Geoff's waiting.
[06:09.650 --> 06:10.990]  Ah, Geoff's on the rocket.
[06:12.510 --> 06:14.870]  Why did it start me under the stage?
[06:14.930 --> 06:16.070]  I didn't even get to go.
[06:16.310 --> 06:17.350]  Go get it, Geoff. Go get it.
[06:17.450 --> 06:18.030]  You can do it.
[06:19.870 --> 06:20.770]  What the fuck?
[06:21.110 --> 06:22.810]  Oh, I got it. I got it.
[06:22.870 --> 06:24.530]  What? Damn it.
[06:25.810 --> 06:26.870]  I like this.
[06:27.110 --> 06:28.130]  This is ridiculous.
[06:29.090 --> 06:30.630]  We got to get rid of this rocket.
[06:33.570 --> 06:34.310]  Bees rocket.
[06:35.590 --> 06:37.390]  Oh, put the bees, put the bees.
[06:37.470 --> 06:38.170]  I'll move this elsewhere.
[06:38.490 --> 06:40.570]  You got it. You got it, Gavin.
[06:41.870 --> 06:43.910]  I hope that I get to go this time.
[06:44.510 --> 06:47.630]  You know what? Let's let's make this a little shit.
[06:47.950 --> 06:49.550]  Well, interesting at the time.
[06:49.750 --> 06:55.830]  Well, I just jumped straight up and down and I got bunced.
[06:56.270 --> 06:56.550]  No.
[06:57.150 --> 06:58.170]  Uh, hello.
[06:58.170 --> 07:01.670]  Oh, Jay train a coming for the sub.
[07:04.110 --> 07:05.210]  What the fuck?
[07:05.710 --> 07:07.130]  Was the side oiled?
[07:07.350 --> 07:08.710]  Why did I roll jump?
[07:08.850 --> 07:09.750]  That's what I'm saying.
[07:09.790 --> 07:10.970]  Why did that happen?
[07:11.590 --> 07:13.570]  Oh, who cleaned the side?
[07:13.970 --> 07:15.070]  Oh, my God.
[07:19.510 --> 07:20.630]  No, no.
[07:25.190 --> 07:25.750]  Ridiculous.
[07:27.710 --> 07:30.150]  I'm going to put in a little Eric saver.
[07:30.350 --> 07:30.850]  Thank you.
[07:31.210 --> 07:32.090]  This one, this one's for you.
[07:32.210 --> 07:35.330]  Getting too schwifty in the chat could be lying, could be telling the truth.
[07:35.710 --> 07:37.890]  Says I'm having my first son in April.
[07:38.050 --> 07:39.330]  Anyone have any ideas?
[07:41.410 --> 07:43.910]  Oh, I got pucked.
[07:43.970 --> 07:44.950]  Name ideas.
[07:45.210 --> 07:45.390]  Yeah.
[07:45.470 --> 07:47.270]  You ever thought about naming somebody else's kid?
[07:47.930 --> 07:48.410]  Go on, go.
[07:49.190 --> 07:49.670]  There you go.
[07:49.810 --> 07:50.530]  It's pretty good.
[07:50.850 --> 07:52.590]  I'll go with a name.
[07:52.630 --> 07:53.390]  I'm a little spooky.
[07:55.610 --> 07:57.090]  Hey, hey, hey.
[07:57.090 --> 07:57.830]  Where'd you get that?
[07:57.950 --> 07:58.750]  Too many teasers.
[07:59.130 --> 08:00.310]  I'm a freaking ghost.
[08:00.750 --> 08:01.430]  Get off me.
[08:01.850 --> 08:02.630]  I'm haunted.
[08:02.990 --> 08:03.970]  I'm a haunted bird.
[08:04.050 --> 08:04.790]  You annoying ghost.
[08:04.810 --> 08:05.730]  Nick, stay on top of him.
[08:06.050 --> 08:06.590]  Nick, stay on top of him.
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.250]  How do you become a ghost?
[08:07.590 --> 08:07.930]  Get him, Nick.
[08:07.950 --> 08:08.470]  You should've left.
[08:08.550 --> 08:09.250]  You should've left.
[08:09.630 --> 08:09.850]  You just have to not lose your body.
[08:10.510 --> 08:12.510]  Oh, go up there.
[08:12.690 --> 08:13.350]  Yeah, there you go.
[08:13.690 --> 08:14.410]  Yes, yes, yes.
[08:14.850 --> 08:15.210]  Yes.
[08:15.610 --> 08:16.130]  Yes.
[08:16.490 --> 08:17.210]  Damn you.
[08:17.530 --> 08:18.050]  Squirrel.
[08:18.730 --> 08:19.630]  I'm a squirrel.
[08:20.250 --> 08:20.650]  No.
[08:21.550 --> 08:22.070]  Oh.
[08:22.110 --> 08:22.490]  Yes.
[08:28.770 --> 08:30.370]  Now you can haunt yourself.
[08:30.370 --> 08:30.570]  Sorry, Gavin.
[08:31.150 --> 08:33.030]  Glungo Lil' Spooky Douglas.
[08:34.330 --> 08:35.870]  Glungo Lil' Spooky Douglas.
[08:36.070 --> 08:37.850]  That's a fucking power name right there.
[08:37.950 --> 08:38.930]  That's a future president.
[08:42.740 --> 08:43.180]  Hmm.
[08:43.720 --> 08:44.200]  Hmm.
[08:44.580 --> 08:45.660]  I don't want this guy.
[08:46.560 --> 08:47.160]  The flower?
[08:47.580 --> 08:47.780]  Yeah.
[08:47.940 --> 08:48.740]  The flower wouldn't hurt no one.
[08:48.860 --> 08:49.520]  I hate the flower.
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.140]  How about that?
[08:51.940 --> 08:52.800]  Hey, squirrel, today.
[08:53.240 --> 08:53.620]  I'm thinking.
[08:53.620 --> 08:55.140]  He's like, drill, baby, drill.
[08:55.440 --> 08:56.180]  He doesn't like flowers.
[08:56.380 --> 08:56.720]  Oh, no.
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.500]  Oh, shit.
[08:57.600 --> 08:58.340]  Two dead guys.
[09:00.200 --> 09:00.680]  Get him.
[09:01.240 --> 09:01.780]  Get his ass.
[09:01.780 --> 09:02.140]  Get off me.
[09:02.360 --> 09:03.980]  Get his fucking monkey ass.
[09:04.160 --> 09:04.940]  He boosted me.
[09:07.560 --> 09:07.940]  No.
[09:08.220 --> 09:08.420]  God.
[09:09.460 --> 09:09.840]  Fuck.
[09:10.360 --> 09:10.720]  No.
[09:11.220 --> 09:12.460]  Your butt's in the shamby.
[09:12.780 --> 09:13.160]  Get him.
[09:13.280 --> 09:13.680]  Get him.
[09:13.700 --> 09:14.500]  Get his monkey ass.
[09:14.520 --> 09:15.160]  I'm haunted to shit.
[09:15.540 --> 09:15.900]  Get him.
[09:15.960 --> 09:16.100]  Get him.
[09:16.100 --> 09:16.240]  Get him.
[09:16.260 --> 09:16.480]  Push.
[09:16.560 --> 09:16.760]  Push.
[09:16.760 --> 09:17.080]  Get me away.
[09:17.300 --> 09:18.500]  Get me up.
[09:19.320 --> 09:20.580]  This is impossible.
[09:21.840 --> 09:22.280]  No.
[09:24.640 --> 09:25.640]  Get out of here.
[09:26.020 --> 09:26.720]  No, no, no.
[09:29.720 --> 09:31.500]  Move, you fat dead idiot.
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.800]  No, don't let him do it.
[09:36.080 --> 09:36.680]  Damn it.
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.300]  He juked me.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.280]  I got juked.
[09:39.840 --> 09:42.040]  Man, those ghosts are a little bit of horseshit.
[09:42.280 --> 09:43.080]  Oh, I love the ghosts.
[09:43.200 --> 09:43.940]  That's a lot of fun.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.760]  I wish one of our new nicknames was fat dead idiot.
[09:46.760 --> 09:47.480]  That was good.
[09:48.640 --> 09:50.500]  That was almost the nickname I gave you.
[09:51.820 --> 09:53.800]  You are not happy with me today.
[09:54.820 --> 09:57.240]  Can someone make sure that that's on my gravestone?
[09:58.220 --> 09:58.900]  Fat dead idiot.
[09:59.220 --> 10:00.140]  I want to do old mansion.
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.100]  It's got a question mark.
[10:01.780 --> 10:03.020]  So does the pier.
[10:03.160 --> 10:03.500]  Okay, cool.
[10:04.100 --> 10:04.720]  Let's find out.
[10:05.060 --> 10:06.320]  Let's unlock a hat for Nick.
[10:07.540 --> 10:08.460]  You need something.
[10:08.600 --> 10:09.480]  He didn't accessorize at all.
[10:09.480 --> 10:09.720]  I need hats.
[10:10.020 --> 10:11.320]  All right, the pier, boys.
[10:12.200 --> 10:12.400]  Pier.
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.840]  Hey, repping the 252.
[10:13.940 --> 10:14.620]  Thanks for the subs.
[10:15.180 --> 10:15.560]  Hell yeah.
[10:15.560 --> 10:16.180]  Okay.
[10:19.910 --> 10:20.350]  Yeah.
[10:20.970 --> 10:21.410]  Yeah.
[10:22.170 --> 10:22.610]  Yeah.
[10:22.790 --> 10:23.930]  So we start here.
[10:24.270 --> 10:25.590]  We go that way.
[10:25.710 --> 10:25.950]  Go.
[10:27.670 --> 10:29.090]  But there's only one way to go.
[10:29.090 --> 10:30.770]  I don't remember much about this level, to be honest.
[10:31.450 --> 10:31.850]  Let's see.
[10:33.570 --> 10:34.450]  Oh, God.
[10:36.090 --> 10:37.350]  Oh, oh, oh, no.
[10:37.490 --> 10:38.830]  Oh, I remember this level now.
[10:39.190 --> 10:39.470]  Run.
[10:39.770 --> 10:40.590]  Geoff, run.
[10:41.050 --> 10:44.010]  Geoff, are you playing the game or are you just like hanging out?
[10:44.010 --> 10:44.970]  I'm surfing, baby.
[10:45.810 --> 10:46.650]  You're dead, Geoff.
[10:46.770 --> 10:47.330]  Then I die.
[10:47.870 --> 10:49.410]  But now I'm a ghost, baby.
[10:51.930 --> 10:52.490]  All right.
[10:52.550 --> 10:52.890]  Here we go.
[10:52.910 --> 10:53.530]  We got to guard him.
[10:53.990 --> 10:55.010]  Make sure he doesn't get over here.
[10:55.150 --> 10:56.310]  This is the ultimate tower defense.
[10:57.550 --> 10:58.250]  I'm going to go get him.
[10:58.430 --> 10:58.770]  There you go.
[10:58.810 --> 10:59.430]  He's got a hat.
[10:59.590 --> 11:00.030]  See ya.
[11:00.750 --> 11:01.630]  Oh, it's a new level.
[11:02.510 --> 11:03.190]  Oh, what was it?
[11:03.370 --> 11:04.050]  Oh, jungle temple.
[11:04.370 --> 11:04.910]  Nick didn't have it.
[11:04.910 --> 11:05.210]  What the hell?
[11:05.890 --> 11:06.030]  No.
[11:06.550 --> 11:06.710]  No.
[11:06.770 --> 11:07.250]  Get him out of here.
[11:07.630 --> 11:07.710]  No.
[11:09.930 --> 11:10.210]  Stupid.
[11:13.710 --> 11:13.990]  Ooh.
[11:16.230 --> 11:16.510]  Yeah.
[11:16.510 --> 11:17.130]  Upstairs.
[11:19.750 --> 11:20.150]  Hmm.
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.590]  What do we want to do here?
[11:23.430 --> 11:23.830]  Hmm.
[11:27.330 --> 11:28.050]  Godspeed, gentlemen.
[11:28.950 --> 11:29.630]  Good luck, boys.
[11:31.810 --> 11:32.210]  Oh.
[11:32.770 --> 11:33.370]  I see.
[11:33.990 --> 11:35.390]  Geoff wants something to happen here.
[11:36.910 --> 11:37.310]  Run.
[11:41.030 --> 11:41.430]  Aloha.
[11:43.950 --> 11:44.510]  Oh, no.
[11:44.670 --> 11:45.730]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:47.050 --> 11:48.310]  Where did Geoff go?
[11:48.690 --> 11:49.470]  I'm going down here.
[11:52.610 --> 11:54.030]  How did you beat me there?
[11:55.550 --> 11:56.590]  Oh, I was faster.
[11:58.290 --> 11:59.750]  I suppose that checks out.
[12:00.310 --> 12:00.470]  Yep.
[12:02.430 --> 12:02.870]  Ooh.
[12:03.570 --> 12:04.230]  Hey, Gavin.
[12:04.430 --> 12:04.630]  Yeah.
[12:05.310 --> 12:06.210]  Let's see how fast you are now.
[12:07.230 --> 12:07.670]  Ooh.
[12:08.490 --> 12:09.570]  How fast are you now?
[12:11.650 --> 12:12.250]  Oh, shit.
[12:13.890 --> 12:14.990]  Oh, go, rat, go.
[12:17.110 --> 12:18.190]  Oh, it just opens.
[12:18.230 --> 12:18.870]  That's great.
[12:19.310 --> 12:19.570]  Yeah.
[12:19.950 --> 12:20.990]  There we go, boys.
[12:21.010 --> 12:22.310]  That's a champion right there.
[12:22.550 --> 12:24.210]  That's underdog first place.
[12:24.330 --> 12:24.950]  Give me all the points.
[12:25.110 --> 12:25.410]  No points.
[12:25.410 --> 12:25.850]  No points.
[12:25.970 --> 12:26.630]  Too easy.
[12:26.630 --> 12:26.710]  Too easy.
[12:26.890 --> 12:27.550]  Everybody scored.
[12:29.490 --> 12:30.410]  There we go.
[12:32.630 --> 12:32.890]  Mummy.
[12:35.030 --> 12:35.810]  Who wants it?
[12:41.810 --> 12:42.430]  Good luck.
[12:43.790 --> 12:44.230]  Oh.
[12:44.430 --> 12:45.310]  Oh, twat.
[12:45.530 --> 12:46.250]  Oh, you can't.
[12:46.850 --> 12:47.750]  It's a trap.
[12:47.810 --> 12:47.970]  It's a trap.
[12:47.970 --> 12:49.490]  It's a trap.
[12:50.410 --> 12:52.170]  Oh, that sucked.
[12:52.570 --> 12:53.530]  Oh, it's a trap.
[12:57.070 --> 12:57.710]  Brutal.
[12:57.950 --> 12:58.310]  Ruthless.
[12:58.870 --> 12:59.250]  Terrible.
[12:59.790 --> 13:00.170]  Vile.
[13:00.430 --> 13:01.090]  What is that?
[13:02.510 --> 13:03.150]  What?
[13:03.490 --> 13:03.610]  Who?
[13:05.130 --> 13:06.630]  That fireball thing.
[13:07.790 --> 13:08.430]  Oh, it's just fire.
[13:08.990 --> 13:11.810]  Why would you blow up the coin?
[13:12.630 --> 13:13.530]  So nobody can have it?
[13:14.970 --> 13:16.050]  You're right, you're right.
[13:16.050 --> 13:17.410]  Oh, God.
[13:18.330 --> 13:18.470]  No.
[13:18.730 --> 13:19.110]  Oh, shit.
[13:19.330 --> 13:21.450]  You can't make it.
[13:21.930 --> 13:22.690]  Yes, you can.
[13:22.730 --> 13:23.210]  We can do it.
[13:23.330 --> 13:23.790]  We got it.
[13:24.190 --> 13:24.890]  I'm almost there.
[13:25.770 --> 13:27.290]  Big Bub Chuggalug.
[13:27.370 --> 13:28.570]  Thanks for the gifted stuff.
[13:29.090 --> 13:29.570]  Wow.
[13:29.970 --> 13:30.610]  Oh, gee, Duff.
[13:30.850 --> 13:31.230]  Damn.
[13:31.490 --> 13:31.850]  Thank you.
[13:31.930 --> 13:32.290]  Good Duff.
[13:32.930 --> 13:33.370]  Good Duff.
[13:35.670 --> 13:37.090]  Now we can make it.
[13:38.790 --> 13:39.170]  Okay.
[13:39.430 --> 13:39.910]  Idiot.
[13:40.710 --> 13:41.670]  You suck.
[13:44.490 --> 13:44.970]  Nice.
[13:48.030 --> 13:49.330]  Will we clear this?
[13:49.710 --> 13:50.330]  Oh, fuck.
[13:50.710 --> 13:51.150]  Nope.
[13:51.610 --> 13:51.670]  Nope.
[13:51.810 --> 13:52.090]  Nope.
[13:52.390 --> 13:53.210]  Oh, no.
[13:54.410 --> 13:54.850]  Yes!
[13:55.110 --> 13:56.350]  Oh, the Hodgepodge!
[13:58.270 --> 13:58.710]  No!
[13:59.610 --> 13:59.710]  Wow.
[14:00.530 --> 14:00.970]  Damn.
[14:02.830 --> 14:03.270]  Brutal.
[14:03.290 --> 14:04.990]  How did the ghosts get trapped in the hell's box?
[14:05.230 --> 14:06.770]  Havoc the Sloth.
[14:07.030 --> 14:08.990]  Thank you, Havoc the Sloth with the gifted subs.
[14:09.050 --> 14:09.910]  You guys are wild today.
[14:09.990 --> 14:10.290]  This is awesome.
[14:10.290 --> 14:10.870]  Thanks, Havoc.
[14:11.070 --> 14:11.810]  We're back, baby.
[14:11.930 --> 14:12.350]  It's Friday.
[14:12.550 --> 14:16.330]  We're working towards the best time of the week, 5.01 PM on a Friday, baby.
[14:16.330 --> 14:17.570]  Doesn't get any better.
[14:17.830 --> 14:18.590]  It's true.
[14:19.430 --> 14:21.110]  It does not.
[14:24.020 --> 14:24.660]  Why?
[14:25.960 --> 14:26.800]  We can't get through.
[14:27.160 --> 14:28.260]  Good luck.
[14:28.580 --> 14:28.820]  Who, me?
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.520]  Who, me?
[14:32.240 --> 14:32.580]  There I go.
[14:33.040 --> 14:33.360]  Fuck!
[14:34.360 --> 14:35.360]  You'll do us shit.
[14:57.750 --> 14:59.450]  What is that shit?
[15:04.920 --> 15:05.400]  Alvin!
[15:07.580 --> 15:09.580]  Malignant Toaster, 5 gifted.
[15:10.000 --> 15:10.600]  Denise Crate.
[15:10.680 --> 15:12.160]  Guys, this is great.
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.720]  We are desperately trying to beat the level one more time.
[15:16.480 --> 15:16.960]  Please.
[15:18.200 --> 15:19.880]  Oh, I grabbed the wrong fucking thing.
[15:20.120 --> 15:22.620]  I wanted the thingy that did the stuff.
[15:22.920 --> 15:23.420]  What thingy?
[15:24.140 --> 15:25.480]  Oh, my God!
[15:25.600 --> 15:25.760]  What a bomb!
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.600]  Oh, Gavin, let's work together.
[15:26.940 --> 15:27.360]  Ooh, collab?
[15:27.880 --> 15:28.200]  Yeah.
[15:29.340 --> 15:29.700]  What do you think?
[15:29.700 --> 15:31.040]  Classic Nick and Gavin collab?
[15:31.500 --> 15:31.920]  Oh, yeah!
[15:34.260 --> 15:35.080]  You're gonna be crushed.
[15:35.560 --> 15:35.900]  I suck!
[15:36.240 --> 15:36.740]  God damn it!
[15:37.820 --> 15:38.460]  Couldn't go anywhere.
[15:38.800 --> 15:38.940]  God!
[15:39.040 --> 15:41.440]  I died and fell on everyone's head and no one could move.
[15:41.460 --> 15:41.640]  Yep.
[15:41.860 --> 15:42.740]  No, could not move.
[15:43.120 --> 15:43.480]  Trapped.
[15:47.480 --> 15:48.300]  Three turns left.
[15:48.440 --> 15:49.040]  Three turns left.
[15:49.220 --> 15:51.440]  All right, I still have time to turn it around.
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.040]  Look at our collab over there, Nick.
[15:53.880 --> 15:55.040]  Oh, dude, it's doing work.
[15:55.380 --> 15:55.980]  It's doing great.
[15:56.260 --> 15:56.980]  It's doing great.
[15:57.060 --> 15:57.500]  You know what?
[15:57.660 --> 15:58.860]  I think...
[15:58.860 --> 15:59.440]  I missed.
[15:59.900 --> 16:00.360]  There we go.
[16:02.040 --> 16:02.700]  Oh, sorry, Gavin.
[16:02.700 --> 16:04.860]  I blocked another collab.
[16:05.440 --> 16:06.360]  Gavin!
[16:08.840 --> 16:10.280]  Oh, God.
[16:11.020 --> 16:11.520]  Oh, no!
[16:12.100 --> 16:13.080]  I suck!
[16:13.620 --> 16:14.180]  We're all!
[16:22.680 --> 16:23.360]  Two turns left.
[16:25.340 --> 16:28.900]  That really started with the Pico Park last week.
[16:33.140 --> 16:36.540]  It's the way I've been shaming people in public around my wife.
[16:36.580 --> 16:37.080]  She loves it.
[16:37.100 --> 16:38.700]  She's highly entertained by it.
[16:39.320 --> 16:43.480]  Any time I see somebody be rude or do something mean or terrible in public, I just go,
[16:43.780 --> 16:45.300]  Mm, mm, mm, right to their face.
[16:45.340 --> 16:45.740]  And they're like, what?
[16:46.460 --> 16:47.060]  Mm, mm, mm.
[16:47.760 --> 16:48.580]  Don't say nothing.
[16:48.700 --> 16:49.700]  Just, mm, mm, mm.
[16:50.760 --> 16:51.200]  Go!
[16:51.460 --> 16:51.840]  Go!
[16:51.960 --> 16:52.180]  Move!
[16:53.340 --> 16:54.160]  Oh, Geoff!
[16:55.300 --> 16:55.660]  Oh, coin!
[16:56.860 --> 16:58.040]  Open the frickin' door!
[16:58.360 --> 16:59.020]  Oh, God.
[16:59.140 --> 16:59.880]  Oh, no!
[17:03.220 --> 17:05.940]  Well, at least we don't have to keep playing this level.
[17:08.120 --> 17:08.720]  Eric's right.
[17:08.840 --> 17:10.360]  Let's get some piss rats in the chat.
[17:10.420 --> 17:11.300]  That's an excellent point, Eric.
[17:11.300 --> 17:12.220]  Yeah, I like it, Eric.
[17:12.440 --> 17:13.240]  Thanks for all the piss.
[17:14.940 --> 17:15.980]  That's Andrew's line.
[17:17.980 --> 17:19.220]  Goodbye and thanks for all the piss.
[17:19.600 --> 17:22.140]  Yeah, so long and thanks for all the piss is gonna be his autobiography.
[17:24.540 --> 17:25.600]  We're pissing on you.
[17:28.680 --> 17:29.580]  Alright, there we go.
[17:31.160 --> 17:32.340]  Thanks for all the piss.
[17:32.340 --> 17:33.400]  A boy and his fetish.
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.640]  It's gonna taste iceberg.
[17:38.960 --> 17:40.100]  Oh, it did!
[17:40.920 --> 17:42.040]  Thank you very much.
[17:45.160 --> 17:46.900]  Alright, startin' fresh.
[17:47.160 --> 17:48.180]  We got this.
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.880]  Oh, look, it's not even giving us, you know, things to mess with each other too bad.
[17:54.220 --> 17:54.480]  Mm.
[17:55.540 --> 17:56.060]  Mm.
[17:57.040 --> 17:57.560]  Mm.
[18:03.120 --> 18:04.840]  It's the one-by-one box.
[18:13.460 --> 18:14.820]  Oh, that, you can't...
[18:14.820 --> 18:15.900]  Guys, don't touch that.
[18:17.680 --> 18:19.680]  Squirrel wants to play for...
[18:19.680 --> 18:19.900]  What?
[18:20.140 --> 18:20.740]  Oh, I get...
[18:20.740 --> 18:22.460]  Geoff, I unlocked the squirrel for you.
[18:22.680 --> 18:23.700]  Hey, hell yeah!
[18:23.880 --> 18:24.240]  Thanks.
[18:24.680 --> 18:25.160]  No problem, man.
[18:25.160 --> 18:25.360]  Good job.
[18:25.700 --> 18:26.200]  No problem.
[18:26.440 --> 18:26.900]  Yeah, that's right.
[18:26.940 --> 18:27.420]  We all did it.
[18:27.440 --> 18:27.880]  We all won.
[18:28.020 --> 18:28.120]  See?
[18:28.640 --> 18:29.740]  We were all dancing.
[18:34.280 --> 18:35.320]  We were all dancing.
[18:35.880 --> 18:36.760]  Didn't even see who I picked.
[18:36.980 --> 18:37.420]  Damn.
[18:38.020 --> 18:38.580]  Tried to get it.
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.240]  Wouldn't get it for me.
[18:39.260 --> 18:41.400]  We should do closed eye picking one round.
[18:41.960 --> 18:42.400]  Oh.
[18:43.280 --> 18:43.940]  That's a good idea.
[18:47.760 --> 18:50.100]  Do I want to...
[18:51.340 --> 18:51.780]  Yeah.
[18:52.240 --> 18:54.080]  If the answer is fuckery, then yes.
[18:54.560 --> 18:54.900]  Yes.
[18:57.820 --> 18:59.060]  Fuckery will be had by all!
[19:03.720 --> 19:04.360]  Ah, shit.
[19:06.500 --> 19:07.320]  Ah, shit.
[19:08.240 --> 19:09.020]  Hey, what's...
[19:09.020 --> 19:09.280]  Thank you.
[19:09.420 --> 19:10.640]  Oh, it moves completely.
[19:12.260 --> 19:12.660]  Gavin.
[19:12.760 --> 19:13.320]  Oh, wait.
[19:13.460 --> 19:14.440]  Oh, that's like attached?
[19:15.140 --> 19:16.320]  Yeah, I glued it.
[19:16.520 --> 19:16.940]  Oh, Geoff.
[19:17.980 --> 19:18.700]  Get off me.
[19:19.440 --> 19:19.680]  Gavin!
[19:20.140 --> 19:20.540]  Fuck him.
[19:22.200 --> 19:22.760]  That's right.
[19:22.780 --> 19:23.680]  The raccoon did it, baby.
[19:24.640 --> 19:25.220]  Just kidding.
[19:25.300 --> 19:25.760]  I haven't done it yet.
[19:26.740 --> 19:27.420]  Oh, get crushed.
[19:27.620 --> 19:27.640]  Oh, die.
[19:27.640 --> 19:27.880]  Die.
[19:29.400 --> 19:31.280]  We should stick stuff on the inside of that.
[19:32.620 --> 19:32.940]  Yes.
[19:34.780 --> 19:35.420]  Ooh.
[19:36.860 --> 19:38.480]  Everybody wanted that.
[19:39.500 --> 19:41.340]  My internet is fucked.
[19:42.340 --> 19:42.680]  No.
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.040]  It's not working.
[19:44.540 --> 19:44.820]  Oh, no.
[19:47.320 --> 19:50.300]  That was the most disingenuous oh no I've ever heard.
[19:50.520 --> 19:50.980]  Yeah.
[19:51.780 --> 19:52.560]  Oh, it's all good.
[19:52.620 --> 19:53.780]  But we're talking to you.
[19:57.360 --> 19:59.100]  I'm thinking, Eric.
[20:00.680 --> 20:01.320]  Okay.
[20:01.620 --> 20:02.760]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[20:07.380 --> 20:08.660]  All right.
[20:08.720 --> 20:09.740]  What's going on over here?
[20:09.800 --> 20:10.420]  What have you done?
[20:12.420 --> 20:12.620]  Wow.
[20:14.940 --> 20:15.580]  Eric!
[20:15.800 --> 20:16.160]  No!
[20:16.340 --> 20:16.760]  Yeah, what?
[20:20.060 --> 20:20.980]  The fan!
[20:24.820 --> 20:25.460]  Oh!
[20:26.120 --> 20:28.300]  Just a half step off.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.420]  Oh, I cannot believe it didn't kill you.
[20:31.460 --> 20:32.560]  I think that's bullshit.
[20:32.880 --> 20:32.900]  Oh, I can.
[20:32.900 --> 20:34.160]  I can believe it just fine.
[20:34.740 --> 20:35.220]  Ah!
[20:35.920 --> 20:37.680]  What did you expect?
[20:38.120 --> 20:39.640]  Uh, what?
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.680]  I was like, what's the echo of myself?
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.020]  Oh, my God.
[20:45.220 --> 20:47.200]  Thanks for joining us on a Friday, guys.
[20:47.320 --> 20:48.220]  Appreciate you being here.
[20:48.340 --> 20:49.400]  Appreciate everyone being here.
[20:49.860 --> 20:50.920]  This is always fun.
[20:52.500 --> 20:55.900]  Points, points.
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.080]  Nick takes the lead.
[20:57.080 --> 20:58.000]  I got it!
[20:58.120 --> 20:58.760]  I'm in!
[21:00.140 --> 21:01.180]  I think he's wearing the mask.
[21:02.000 --> 21:02.260]  What?
[21:03.300 --> 21:04.820]  Still hasn't gone for it yet, though, we know.
[21:04.880 --> 21:05.440]  Nuh-uh, not yet.
[21:05.440 --> 21:06.320]  No, I need to bring it home.
[21:07.020 --> 21:08.240]  Yeah, it hasn't been in the office.
[21:08.720 --> 21:09.800]  It's at the 100% EAT office.
[21:13.020 --> 21:14.140]  Can I do this?
[21:14.320 --> 21:14.800]  Will this work?
[21:14.960 --> 21:15.720]  You can do whatever you want.
[21:15.720 --> 21:16.340]  This is America.
[21:19.040 --> 21:20.380]  You just gotta believe in yourself, Eric.
[21:21.120 --> 21:21.600]  Thanks, man.
[21:23.580 --> 21:26.000]  Are we gonna play the game, or are we just hanging out, or?
[21:26.000 --> 21:26.640]  There we go.
[21:26.820 --> 21:27.960]  Oh, I like it.
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.280]  I like it.
[21:29.720 --> 21:32.180]  You made it?
[21:32.300 --> 21:33.220]  That doesn't kill you?
[21:34.320 --> 21:34.980]  It makes you stronger.
[21:35.740 --> 21:36.600]  Yep, it does.
[21:37.380 --> 21:39.400]  Wait, so why didn't it kill Gavin?
[21:39.940 --> 21:40.520]  Because it sucks.
[21:40.600 --> 21:41.920]  I went when it wasn't there.
[21:42.800 --> 21:46.860]  Oh, on my screen, it was you getting, like, annihilated by it.
[21:47.320 --> 21:48.760]  Yeah, that's why I was asking.
[21:49.660 --> 21:51.080]  That's also why I went.
[21:54.060 --> 21:55.640]  I seem to be...
[21:55.640 --> 21:56.140]  Oh, shit.
[21:56.380 --> 21:58.320]  Oh, God.
[21:59.400 --> 21:59.860]  Elevator.
[22:00.860 --> 22:02.720]  Reach is all the way in the attic.
[22:04.280 --> 22:05.780]  I wonder if I can shove my body in.
[22:06.360 --> 22:06.820]  No!
[22:07.100 --> 22:07.640]  It'll kill me!
[22:07.920 --> 22:08.080]  No!
[22:09.620 --> 22:10.820]  Take my body.
[22:10.900 --> 22:11.580]  Hit my body up.
[22:13.160 --> 22:14.400]  We can't have Nick win.
[22:15.660 --> 22:17.300]  No good things for Nick.
[22:17.960 --> 22:18.180]  Nope.
[22:18.420 --> 22:21.440]  How did you work your way back down?
[22:21.640 --> 22:22.440]  You were up there.
[22:22.980 --> 22:23.340]  No!
[22:27.860 --> 22:28.880]  I'm not giving up.
[22:28.960 --> 22:30.120]  Yeah, well, beat him up, Nick.
[22:30.600 --> 22:30.960]  No!
[22:32.480 --> 22:34.720]  Knock him down. I still need to take my body to the end.
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.100]  Nick, you suck!
[22:41.620 --> 22:41.980]  No!
[22:42.580 --> 22:43.520]  We got him, boys.
[22:43.720 --> 22:44.280]  We got him.
[22:44.640 --> 22:45.220]  Damn it!
[22:45.600 --> 22:46.860]  We got him, boys. Way to go.
[22:49.220 --> 22:50.860]  I had it. I had it.
[22:51.420 --> 22:52.980]  You bastard, Geoff. You bastard.
[22:53.340 --> 22:54.280]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[23:03.090 --> 23:04.430]  What'd you do with those bees, buddy?
[23:04.650 --> 23:05.550]  That's a lot of bees.
[23:05.750 --> 23:06.510]  That's a lot to go.
[23:06.870 --> 23:07.490]  Oh, no!
[23:13.270 --> 23:14.450]  Stop jumping over here!
[23:14.450 --> 23:14.930]  I'm stuck over here!
[23:15.490 --> 23:16.170]  Oh, no!
[23:17.750 --> 23:17.850]  Okay.
[23:19.810 --> 23:20.250]  No!
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.560]  Come on, bees! Let's get him!
[23:26.480 --> 23:26.640]  No!
[23:27.660 --> 23:28.460]  Get him, bees!
[23:30.360 --> 23:31.420]  Geoff got the coin!
[23:32.160 --> 23:32.600]  No!
[23:33.360 --> 23:34.260]  Oh, God!
[23:34.380 --> 23:35.060]  Get me in there!
[23:38.710 --> 23:39.520]  Got him!
[23:39.900 --> 23:40.860]  Bees time, baby!
[23:41.040 --> 23:41.260]  Yeah!
[23:43.140 --> 23:44.780]  Give me those trap points.
[23:46.360 --> 23:47.580]  Underdog, here we go.
[23:47.820 --> 23:48.960]  Geoff takes the lead.
[23:50.500 --> 23:52.540]  Don't worry, I'll fucking Geoff it real hard here.
[23:52.720 --> 23:55.800]  More bees! More bees! More bees!
[23:56.540 --> 23:57.360]  Gavin, you want to collab?
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.080]  Uh, oh.
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.200]  I like you.
[24:03.780 --> 24:04.520]  You're welcome.
[24:07.140 --> 24:09.180]  Don't let Eric die, he'll leave bees to you.
[24:09.760 --> 24:10.660]  I will. It's true.
[24:11.080 --> 24:11.640]  Oh, shit!
[24:11.780 --> 24:14.780]  You literally just smashed my head into the wall and killed me!
[24:15.220 --> 24:16.360]  I am still...
[24:16.700 --> 24:19.200]  Yeah, you just tackled me to death.
[24:19.220 --> 24:20.420]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[24:20.440 --> 24:21.780]  Now I'm wedged in the ceiling!
[24:22.060 --> 24:22.340]  Fuck!
[24:22.680 --> 24:23.160]  Way to go, Geoff!
[24:23.940 --> 24:25.140]  Oh, I got arrowed hard.
[24:25.160 --> 24:25.920]  Oh, nice collab.
[24:27.220 --> 24:28.160]  Nick, how'd collab work?
[24:28.640 --> 24:29.360]  It didn't!
[24:29.540 --> 24:29.680]  I'm stuck!
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.780]  You just pushed me into...
[24:34.780 --> 24:34.900]  Oh, no!
[24:34.900 --> 24:36.300]  Oh, nice collab, Nick!
[24:36.300 --> 24:36.900]  The very bottom arrow.
[24:36.900 --> 24:37.560]  He did it again!
[24:37.880 --> 24:38.160]  That's tough.
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.660]  You get the points for it, though.
[24:39.720 --> 24:40.260]  It's a heartbreaker.
[24:40.460 --> 24:41.080]  It's a heartbreaker.
[24:41.940 --> 24:44.660]  Did anyone see Nick just ring my neck or something?
[24:44.740 --> 24:46.020]  He just ended my life.
[24:49.160 --> 24:49.560]  Yeah.
[24:53.440 --> 24:53.840]  No!
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.820]  I want the beginning to go faster.
[24:58.440 --> 24:59.120]  Okay, me too.
[24:59.980 --> 25:00.440]  Oh, hell yeah.
[25:00.460 --> 25:01.000]  You can't put it there.
[25:01.000 --> 25:01.320]  Fire.
[25:01.540 --> 25:02.300]  There we go.
[25:04.840 --> 25:05.660]  Oh, God.
[25:06.160 --> 25:06.560]  Oh!
[25:07.160 --> 25:07.640]  Oh, Jesus.
[25:11.360 --> 25:12.360]  Release my spirit.
[25:13.480 --> 25:13.700]  Oh, no!
[25:13.800 --> 25:14.180]  Gavin's dead!
[25:14.300 --> 25:15.060]  We have to...
[25:15.060 --> 25:15.520]  This is it.
[25:15.600 --> 25:16.340]  We gotta make the run.
[25:16.820 --> 25:18.000]  No, stop knocking me off, Geoff!
[25:18.060 --> 25:18.200]  Please!
[25:19.660 --> 25:21.100]  Oh, that sucks for you.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.160]  Oh, there's a...
[25:22.160 --> 25:22.740]  Oh, whoa!
[25:23.040 --> 25:25.020]  I did not see the hay bale up there.
[25:25.100 --> 25:25.760]  That was a heartbreaker.
[25:27.040 --> 25:27.700]  No bees!
[25:27.780 --> 25:28.680]  Why are they coming to me?
[25:29.040 --> 25:30.540]  What the fuck?
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.840]  You bought me the bees!
[25:33.060 --> 25:33.980]  You motherfucker!
[25:37.960 --> 25:40.120]  Three judgy ghosts standing with bees.
[25:42.120 --> 25:42.600]  Aw, man!
[25:43.280 --> 25:44.600]  Oh, we both got it, Geoff!
[25:44.700 --> 25:45.820]  I wish there were more bees.
[25:50.870 --> 25:52.490]  Holy shit, we're not gonna be able to beat it.
[25:52.930 --> 25:53.390]  Yeah, we will.
[25:53.450 --> 25:53.830]  We got it.
[25:54.290 --> 25:54.770]  What do you think, Gavin?
[25:54.810 --> 25:55.110]  Which way?
[25:56.410 --> 25:57.010]  You want me to go under?
[25:57.370 --> 25:58.390]  I would put it there.
[25:59.130 --> 25:59.310]  Here?
[25:59.550 --> 25:59.770]  Yeah.
[26:00.210 --> 26:00.490]  Okay.
[26:05.190 --> 26:06.830]  I've done it again!
[26:08.970 --> 26:10.730]  Alright, I'm gonna go in a bee safari.
[26:10.730 --> 26:11.110]  Oh, you motherfucker!
[26:12.690 --> 26:12.910]  Oops.
[26:13.850 --> 26:14.930]  How did you do that?
[26:15.110 --> 26:17.130]  Eric, Eric, we just have to not die here.
[26:17.150 --> 26:18.610]  You just pushed me right off!
[26:18.770 --> 26:19.390]  Oh, hay bale!
[26:20.570 --> 26:22.030]  Oh, oh, oh, it's all slow-mo!
[26:22.210 --> 26:22.770]  Oh, oh, oh, God!
[26:23.070 --> 26:24.090]  Oh, this is, this is...
[26:24.090 --> 26:24.630]  Oh!
[26:25.290 --> 26:25.690]  Ah!
[26:26.210 --> 26:26.770]  The bees!
[26:26.770 --> 26:27.170]  The bees!
[26:31.850 --> 26:35.230]  He's like the pain from Metal Gear Solid 3.
[26:36.690 --> 26:38.110]  I am the fury.
[26:39.110 --> 26:40.230]  Oh, my God.
[26:41.070 --> 26:41.250]  Huh.
[26:42.010 --> 26:42.490]  What?
[26:42.570 --> 26:43.010]  I didn't get that?
[26:44.190 --> 26:44.970]  Oh, you wanted the stairs?
[26:45.250 --> 26:46.110]  I thought I got them.
[26:46.270 --> 26:46.750]  That's alright.
[26:48.470 --> 26:50.030]  I'm changing a lot right now.
[26:53.490 --> 26:53.970]  Well...
[26:53.970 --> 26:55.030]  I don't think we can beat this.
[26:57.330 --> 26:58.190]  Let me be...
[26:59.230 --> 26:59.710]  Hope.
[27:00.390 --> 27:01.850]  Okay, you can be some hope.
[27:02.430 --> 27:02.670]  Ah!
[27:03.390 --> 27:04.910]  I did what Gavin does!
[27:05.490 --> 27:06.150]  I'm Gavin!
[27:06.430 --> 27:07.870]  Oh, Gavin, Gavin got Gavin.
[27:08.790 --> 27:10.130]  Way to go, Nick!
[27:10.190 --> 27:10.490]  Damn it.
[27:10.490 --> 27:11.450]  Where's your hope now, idiot?
[27:14.310 --> 27:14.710]  Ow.
[27:16.050 --> 27:16.610]  Give me these bees.
[27:17.550 --> 27:18.710]  How many more turns?
[27:19.070 --> 27:19.550]  Three.
[27:19.810 --> 27:20.210]  There we go.
[27:20.570 --> 27:23.150]  No winners, no points for the next three rounds, please.
[27:28.520 --> 27:29.300]  Things are different.
[27:29.400 --> 27:30.100]  The bees remain.
[27:35.820 --> 27:36.140]  Yeah.
[27:37.280 --> 27:38.360]  Oh, this is bad.
[27:38.640 --> 27:38.960]  Oh!
[27:38.960 --> 27:39.000]  Oh!
[27:39.440 --> 27:39.660]  Oh!
[27:39.740 --> 27:39.820]  Oh!
[27:40.660 --> 27:41.120]  Thanks, Nick.
[27:42.340 --> 27:42.660]  No!
[27:43.480 --> 27:44.160]  Oh, thanks, Eric.
[27:45.980 --> 27:46.300]  How?
[27:46.460 --> 27:46.640]  How?
[27:46.880 --> 27:48.400]  You saw him get hit by that, right?
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.460]  Yeah, he should be dead as dicks.
[27:49.460 --> 27:49.860]  This is bullshit.
[27:52.340 --> 27:52.660]  Okay.
[27:53.760 --> 27:54.940]  How do I...
[27:54.940 --> 27:55.440]  Oh, God.
[27:55.460 --> 27:55.660]  Oh, right.
[27:55.800 --> 27:56.460]  I have to be a ghost.
[27:56.480 --> 27:56.880]  What's up, Gavin?
[27:57.380 --> 27:58.060]  Hey, what's up?
[28:00.000 --> 28:00.400]  Uh...
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.200]  Bring the bees.
[28:01.460 --> 28:03.140]  Dude, can we get out the fuck up there, Jim?
[28:03.180 --> 28:03.640]  What are you doing?
[28:04.500 --> 28:05.620]  God, no, no.
[28:05.720 --> 28:07.260]  There's fucking bees now.
[28:08.000 --> 28:08.620]  There we go.
[28:08.700 --> 28:09.000]  Got him.
[28:09.280 --> 28:09.660]  Got him.
[28:10.620 --> 28:12.140]  Can I just jump be made?
[28:13.720 --> 28:14.980]  I think so?
[28:15.660 --> 28:16.440]  Pretty close.
[28:17.480 --> 28:18.140]  It's tight.
[28:18.540 --> 28:19.120]  It's gonna be tight.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.940]  Don't squeeze me into the thing that killed me, please.
[28:23.940 --> 28:24.760]  I don't want any of these.
[28:24.880 --> 28:25.540]  I want bees!
[28:31.140 --> 28:32.540]  Oh, my God.
[28:32.740 --> 28:33.880]  Well, shit.
[28:35.200 --> 28:36.640]  Oh, I'm just doing a collab.
[28:37.200 --> 28:37.920]  Fuck you.
[28:41.180 --> 28:44.240]  I don't think you know what that is.
[28:48.280 --> 28:49.000]  Oh, shit.
[28:49.060 --> 28:49.540]  Pull the trigger.
[28:51.260 --> 28:51.620]  Fuck!
[28:52.060 --> 28:53.280]  I got annihilated.
[28:53.620 --> 28:54.800]  Give me the fucking bees.
[28:55.260 --> 28:56.440]  Give me the bees!
[28:57.180 --> 28:58.000]  Go, Gavin, go.
[28:58.020 --> 28:58.900]  Give me the bees.
[29:00.380 --> 29:00.940]  Oh, shit.
[29:01.000 --> 29:01.400]  No, no.
[29:01.400 --> 29:02.600]  Idiot.
[29:02.600 --> 29:03.120]  Moron.
[29:03.400 --> 29:04.160]  Cloth idiot.
[29:05.380 --> 29:07.000]  All right.
[29:13.420 --> 29:14.400]  God damn it.
[29:14.940 --> 29:15.720]  Uh-oh.
[29:16.300 --> 29:16.960]  Behold!
[29:18.260 --> 29:18.920]  Uh-oh.
[29:19.440 --> 29:21.640]  The bee holder is coming.
[29:22.340 --> 29:22.860]  Move.
[29:24.720 --> 29:25.800]  You suck!
[29:26.500 --> 29:28.540]  It's fucking bee dance, baby.
[29:29.200 --> 29:30.580]  Bee dance.
[29:32.280 --> 29:36.020]  It's hard to think with all these dead bastards jumping at my face.
[29:38.620 --> 29:39.660]  All right, we got it.
[29:39.800 --> 29:40.160]  I love it.
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.400]  Oh, it's the best.
[29:41.560 --> 29:42.500]  No, that's the...
[29:49.360 --> 29:49.800]  Yeah.
[29:50.500 --> 29:50.940]  Yeah.
[29:50.940 --> 29:51.380]  I'm back, baby.
[29:51.800 --> 29:52.480]  I'm back.
[29:52.480 --> 29:52.840]  Yeah.
[29:53.260 --> 29:54.340]  I'm back in a big way.
[29:55.020 --> 29:55.900]  You idiot!
[29:56.240 --> 29:58.580]  You're tapping me to the frickin' window.
[29:59.080 --> 30:00.320]  All right, Nick, you got this.
[30:04.060 --> 30:06.140]  A frickin' arrow stuck through my dead heart.
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.120]  I win!
[30:07.820 --> 30:08.620]  Geoff wins!
[30:09.060 --> 30:09.460]  Yes!
[30:09.500 --> 30:10.600]  I'm the only one with a turtle!
[30:11.520 --> 30:12.500]  He didn't Geoff it.
[30:12.800 --> 30:13.620]  Way to go, Geoff.
[30:13.860 --> 30:14.220]  Geoff, you did it.
[30:14.220 --> 30:17.120]  All I did was try to make sure nobody won the last three rounds.
[30:17.680 --> 30:19.400]  Where was the Geoffing I was promised?
[30:20.320 --> 30:22.840]  Well, sometimes, you know, Geoff takes a Geoff off.
[30:22.880 --> 30:23.860]  Sometimes he's full of shit.
[30:25.180 --> 30:26.560]  It's nice to win every once in a while.
[30:27.480 --> 30:29.000]  Every once in a while, you gotta try.
[30:29.900 --> 30:30.420]  Oh, here we go.
[30:30.540 --> 30:30.960]  The ballroom.
[30:31.140 --> 30:31.940]  We gotta unlock something.
[30:34.780 --> 30:35.220]  Island?
[30:35.480 --> 30:36.140]  What's this?
[30:36.660 --> 30:37.320]  A new level?
[30:37.320 --> 30:37.540]  What is that?
[30:38.060 --> 30:39.560]  I've never even seen this.
[30:40.640 --> 30:41.560]  This is perfect.
[30:41.760 --> 30:42.820]  And you didn't want me to host?
[30:44.100 --> 30:46.020]  You got levels I ain't even got.
[30:46.400 --> 30:47.240]  That's what I'm telling you, baby.
[30:47.620 --> 30:47.760]  Wow.
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.640]  And you've got Nick's hats that I ain't even got.
[30:51.180 --> 30:52.220]  The fuck is all this stuff?
[30:52.220 --> 30:53.280]  Nick has hats?
[30:54.660 --> 30:54.820]  Huh.
[30:55.300 --> 30:55.740]  Okay.
[30:57.120 --> 30:57.560]  Uh...
[30:57.560 --> 30:58.340]  Where do we...
[30:58.340 --> 30:59.160]  Okay, we start over there.
[31:00.940 --> 31:01.860]  Uh, where's the start?
[31:02.320 --> 31:03.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:03.940 --> 31:04.740]  Thank you.
[31:05.700 --> 31:06.800]  There we go.
[31:06.900 --> 31:08.420]  This will come in handy later.
[31:08.480 --> 31:10.760]  Do these logs move around or are they just...
[31:10.760 --> 31:13.240]  I bet they kind of like bob and float or something.
[31:15.780 --> 31:17.960]  It also says beware of tentacle, maybe?
[31:19.140 --> 31:19.260]  Oh.
[31:19.640 --> 31:20.220]  Uh-oh.
[31:20.700 --> 31:21.500]  Well, I missed my jump.
[31:25.940 --> 31:26.380]  Hey!
[31:26.960 --> 31:28.080]  We made it!
[31:28.660 --> 31:30.200]  These are all the good players.
[31:30.200 --> 31:32.480]  All the other players are bad and dumb.
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.400]  I'm like the Celtics.
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.700]  I'm just reveling in my victory.
[31:36.680 --> 31:36.880]  Yep.
[31:37.800 --> 31:38.720]  So I don't have to play hard.
[31:38.940 --> 31:39.380]  Let's see.
[31:39.780 --> 31:40.700]  What the hell is that?
[31:40.820 --> 31:41.340]  What is this?
[31:41.940 --> 31:43.660]  Wait, did the water level go up?
[31:44.380 --> 31:45.620]  I was like, uh...
[31:45.620 --> 31:46.740]  Do we have to ring the bell?
[31:47.100 --> 31:47.320]  What is that?
[31:47.320 --> 31:47.960]  I don't know.
[31:48.040 --> 31:48.860]  Is it a diving bell?
[31:50.620 --> 31:52.680]  The water level went up though, right?
[31:53.000 --> 31:53.280]  Yeah.
[31:53.460 --> 31:54.520]  Yeah, it's...
[31:54.520 --> 31:54.760]  Geoff?
[31:54.880 --> 31:55.880]  It's night water.
[31:56.960 --> 31:57.820]  It's night water.
[31:58.520 --> 31:58.920]  Oh!
[32:00.220 --> 32:01.340]  Drink your night water.
[32:01.560 --> 32:01.800]  Ah!
[32:04.660 --> 32:05.060]  Yeah.
[32:05.360 --> 32:06.100]  Oh, I suck.
[32:06.140 --> 32:06.780]  Oh, Geoff!
[32:06.780 --> 32:08.000]  And that's how you do it!
[32:08.780 --> 32:09.680]  Way to go, Geoff!
[32:09.820 --> 32:11.720]  And this is all the good players made it, baby!
[32:11.840 --> 32:12.600]  Happy to help.
[32:12.820 --> 32:13.280]  Happy to help.
[32:13.940 --> 32:14.340]  Last round.
[32:15.420 --> 32:16.380]  B1 and a trap.
[32:16.580 --> 32:17.460]  How do you do that?
[32:17.500 --> 32:17.820]  Okay, yeah.
[32:19.020 --> 32:20.180]  I want to try and hit it.
[32:20.800 --> 32:21.100]  Ooh.
[32:22.280 --> 32:22.580]  Do it.
[32:22.640 --> 32:23.100]  Oh, it's gone.
[32:23.840 --> 32:24.240]  Yeah.
[32:24.960 --> 32:26.440]  I think it's only in the...
[32:26.440 --> 32:27.060]  Every other state?
[32:27.060 --> 32:27.520]  There you go, bud.
[32:27.840 --> 32:28.820]  Only during night water.
[32:30.780 --> 32:32.020]  Oh, and the tide is high.
[32:33.020 --> 32:33.960]  And I'm moving on.
[32:35.840 --> 32:37.420]  How do we...
[32:38.680 --> 32:39.660]  You just do it.
[32:40.240 --> 32:40.640]  Yahoo!
[32:41.180 --> 32:42.140]  You just do it.
[32:42.620 --> 32:43.060]  Got it!
[32:43.080 --> 32:43.720]  Oh, I plopped!
[32:43.720 --> 32:44.180]  I made it.
[32:45.620 --> 32:46.500]  Fucking, I hate myself.
[32:46.500 --> 32:47.540]  Way to go, turtle!
[32:48.080 --> 32:48.640]  Alright, Nick, go.
[32:49.400 --> 32:49.860]  Alright, you ready?
[32:50.100 --> 32:50.260]  Yep.
[32:50.320 --> 32:50.580]  You ready?
[32:50.820 --> 32:51.040]  Yep.
[32:51.160 --> 32:51.320]  Jump.
[32:51.600 --> 32:51.760]  Yep.
[32:52.280 --> 32:52.560]  Yeah!
[32:53.160 --> 32:54.080]  Geoff killed me!
[32:55.840 --> 32:56.740]  I didn't make it.
[32:56.880 --> 32:58.000]  Way to go, turtle!
[33:02.680 --> 33:03.400]  Bell time!
[33:04.240 --> 33:04.440]  Ooh!
[33:05.440 --> 33:06.860]  Alright, let's see if we can ring this bell.
[33:12.940 --> 33:13.500]  Oh, collab?
[33:13.780 --> 33:13.940]  Oh.
[33:14.420 --> 33:15.420]  Oh, yeah, we can collab.
[33:15.520 --> 33:15.840]  You want to collab?
[33:16.480 --> 33:18.700]  Yeah, well, what about, like, wanna...
[33:18.700 --> 33:19.280]  Well, I wanna...
[33:19.280 --> 33:19.820]  Oh, you...
[33:19.820 --> 33:20.460]  There you go.
[33:20.520 --> 33:20.940]  Oh, I love it.
[33:20.960 --> 33:21.380]  Like this?
[33:21.540 --> 33:21.820]  Yeah.
[33:22.180 --> 33:22.440]  Okay.
[33:24.400 --> 33:24.760]  Sweet.
[33:25.840 --> 33:26.800]  Love a good collab.
[33:27.580 --> 33:27.980]  Alright.
[33:28.200 --> 33:28.520]  I'm just...
[33:28.520 --> 33:29.220]  I'm gonna try and...
[33:30.020 --> 33:30.420]  Woah!
[33:30.660 --> 33:31.060]  I hit it!
[33:31.220 --> 33:31.820]  I hit it!
[33:32.060 --> 33:32.200]  Woah!
[33:32.500 --> 33:33.780]  Oh my god!
[33:34.520 --> 33:35.320]  Holy shit!
[33:35.520 --> 33:36.280]  What am I gonna do now?
[33:36.280 --> 33:37.220]  Why am I dead?
[33:37.680 --> 33:39.180]  You got shot by the collab.
[33:39.300 --> 33:39.640]  What happened?
[33:39.740 --> 33:40.260]  No, no, no!
[33:40.760 --> 33:41.040]  Ugh!
[33:42.340 --> 33:43.040]  Alright, Gavin.
[33:43.160 --> 33:43.320]  Oh!
[33:43.420 --> 33:44.000]  It's gone!
[33:44.380 --> 33:44.600]  I got...
[33:44.600 --> 33:48.060]  I got slapped by the tentacle and then I got fucking shot with an arrow.
[33:48.580 --> 33:49.160]  That was crazy.
[33:50.320 --> 33:50.800]  Oh, dude!
[33:50.860 --> 33:52.020]  On my screen, you got shot!
[33:52.020 --> 33:52.800]  Please die!
[33:52.860 --> 33:52.880]  Damn you!
[33:52.880 --> 33:53.760]  This is ridiculous.
[33:54.940 --> 33:55.260]  Ah!
[33:55.260 --> 33:55.960]  What?
[33:56.620 --> 33:57.140]  Yeah!
[33:57.420 --> 33:57.840]  Oh shit!
[33:58.100 --> 33:58.260]  Yeah!
[33:59.500 --> 34:02.280]  That was the coolest thing I've ever seen!
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.580]  That was really cool.
[34:03.740 --> 34:05.120]  Wow, look at those trap points.
[34:05.340 --> 34:06.300]  Holy shit!
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.380]  I wanna call the Kraken boy again.
[34:09.580 --> 34:10.480]  This sucks!
[34:10.640 --> 34:12.500]  Where's the fucking...
[34:12.500 --> 34:14.140]  I want bees.
[34:15.720 --> 34:18.840]  Somebody said we need to turn on Twitch integration so that way they can give us bees.
[34:19.040 --> 34:20.280]  I wanna figure that out next time.
[34:20.720 --> 34:20.920]  Oh!
[34:21.460 --> 34:22.420]  Twitch gives bees?
[34:22.920 --> 34:24.020]  Well, you can like...
[34:24.020 --> 34:26.880]  People can like vote on giving additional pieces and parts.
[34:27.240 --> 34:28.020]  Gavin, would that be fun?
[34:28.220 --> 34:28.680]  For God's sake.
[34:28.940 --> 34:29.680]  Just a little something.
[34:30.300 --> 34:31.460]  A little climbable something.
[34:33.000 --> 34:33.720]  Oh shit!
[34:33.880 --> 34:34.140]  Look at that!
[34:37.260 --> 34:37.620]  Jack!
[34:37.720 --> 34:39.660]  I'm just letting everyone kind of do their thing.
[34:39.820 --> 34:40.540]  There we go.
[34:42.940 --> 34:43.780]  What happened to you, Nick?
[34:44.680 --> 34:45.040]  Hey!
[34:45.140 --> 34:45.700]  What happened to me?
[34:46.940 --> 34:47.900]  Oh, I fucking saw it.
[34:47.900 --> 34:48.620]  Oh, I missed it!
[34:51.620 --> 34:51.980]  Okay.
[34:52.460 --> 34:53.840]  Alright, going for the low road.
[34:54.260 --> 34:54.560]  Yep.
[34:55.000 --> 34:55.360]  Oh shit!
[34:56.540 --> 34:57.540]  Oh, I thought he...
[34:57.540 --> 34:58.220]  I thought it was...
[34:58.220 --> 34:59.200]  I timed it...
[34:59.200 --> 35:00.360]  I timed it wrong.
[35:00.460 --> 35:04.340]  I thought I was gonna land on it right as it was changing over and it's like, oh, I got
[35:04.340 --> 35:04.540]  this.
[35:04.560 --> 35:04.900]  I'm good.
[35:05.140 --> 35:06.580]  We should do this map again.
[35:06.700 --> 35:07.140]  There's a lot of fun.
[35:07.160 --> 35:08.080]  Yeah, we probably got to play this one.
[35:08.140 --> 35:08.400]  Yeah, let's do it.
[35:09.460 --> 35:11.320]  Gavin wouldn't stop destroying everybody.
[35:11.760 --> 35:11.980]  Yeah.
[35:13.640 --> 35:15.020]  Hey, I'm playing to win, baby.
[35:15.060 --> 35:16.300]  He doesn't wanna have fun.
[35:16.360 --> 35:17.340]  He wants to win.
[35:17.540 --> 35:19.260]  Oh, much like Andrew during a certain...
[35:19.260 --> 35:21.240]  Yeah, when he wants to go solo mode.
[35:21.300 --> 35:21.500]  Yeah.
[35:23.940 --> 35:24.660]  Hey, 50%.
[35:25.400 --> 35:25.800]  Huh.
[35:27.860 --> 35:29.760]  Find out on Sunday what we're talking about.
[35:29.960 --> 35:31.080]  Oh, that is Sunday, isn't it?
[35:31.440 --> 35:31.920]  It is.
[35:32.300 --> 35:33.020]  That is...
[35:33.020 --> 35:33.600]  Are we Nostradamus?
[35:34.100 --> 35:34.400]  Yep.
[35:34.540 --> 35:34.800]  Yes.
[35:35.360 --> 35:36.760]  Just made a pretty cool thumbnail for that today.
[35:37.300 --> 35:38.160]  Yes, you did.
[35:38.340 --> 35:39.020]  That was...
[35:39.020 --> 35:39.940]  That was very funny.
[35:40.200 --> 35:42.420]  You laughed and then you send it to us and we laughed.
[35:48.080 --> 35:48.480]  That's...
[35:48.480 --> 35:49.180]  It's jumpable.
[35:50.240 --> 35:50.640]  Like...
[35:50.640 --> 35:50.840]  What?
[35:50.840 --> 35:51.360]  You can...
[35:51.360 --> 35:52.000]  You can do it.
[35:52.480 --> 35:52.720]  Yeah.
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.760]  Oh, you can bring that whole thing...
[35:55.760 --> 35:55.900]  Oh.
[35:56.100 --> 35:56.640]  There you go.
[35:56.640 --> 35:57.360]  And he did.
[36:03.720 --> 36:04.120]  What?
[36:04.540 --> 36:05.640]  What do you mean what?
[36:05.820 --> 36:06.700]  You put it...
[36:06.700 --> 36:08.060]  What are you talking about?
[36:09.680 --> 36:10.080]  What?
[36:10.540 --> 36:11.440]  Everyone calm down.
[36:11.780 --> 36:12.360]  Everyone calm down.
[36:12.780 --> 36:13.660]  You threw me!
[36:13.780 --> 36:16.520]  You picked me up like a bowl of paper and threw me away!
[36:18.360 --> 36:19.660]  Geoff, boost me, then I'll boost you.
[36:20.680 --> 36:21.660]  Oh, yeah, that'll work.
[36:22.220 --> 36:22.620]  Come on.
[36:22.760 --> 36:23.860]  I'm the scorpion, you're the frog.
[36:23.960 --> 36:24.220]  Come on.
[36:25.400 --> 36:26.360]  It's in my nature.
[36:29.700 --> 36:31.400]  There's nothing we can do.
[36:31.980 --> 36:32.740]  I'm sorry.
[36:32.920 --> 36:33.400]  It's in my nature.
[36:34.680 --> 36:36.680]  Okay, now's the time.
[36:39.780 --> 36:42.140]  None of these are bees.
[36:43.620 --> 36:44.160]  Collab?
[36:45.040 --> 36:45.320]  Ooh.
[36:45.980 --> 36:46.240]  Ooh.
[36:48.300 --> 36:48.840]  Well...
[36:50.680 --> 36:52.040]  Why can't I put that there?
[36:52.040 --> 36:53.060]  We're not gonna...
[36:53.060 --> 36:54.100]  The arrow is the floor.
[36:54.860 --> 36:54.940]  There you go.
[36:54.940 --> 36:55.400]  Oh, I see.
[36:55.640 --> 36:56.020]  Thank you.
[36:56.020 --> 36:57.820]  There we go.
[36:58.100 --> 37:00.040]  Well, we're gonna die.
[37:01.140 --> 37:11.740]  Oh, this is unfortunate.
[37:14.020 --> 37:14.700]  No!
[37:22.100 --> 37:22.840]  Hit the bell!
[37:23.140 --> 37:23.660]  Yes!
[37:29.930 --> 37:32.080]  Oh, it didn't even do anything!
[37:34.650 --> 37:36.370]  Oh, stupid ass!
[37:36.370 --> 37:36.470]  Yes!
[37:38.170 --> 37:38.650]  Yes!
[37:39.390 --> 37:39.530]  Yes!
[37:40.010 --> 37:40.490]  Yes!
[37:41.810 --> 37:42.290]  No!
[37:44.130 --> 37:45.230]  Good job, Ghost Nick.
[37:45.790 --> 37:46.690]  I got him!
[37:47.790 --> 37:49.530]  There will be no winners today.
[37:50.330 --> 37:52.410]  It's so much more fun when there's no winners.
[37:53.690 --> 37:55.570]  This is... none of this is bees.
[37:56.450 --> 37:57.250]  Spotted for life.
[37:57.350 --> 37:58.370]  These come out on Tuesday.
[38:01.270 --> 38:02.190]  Yeah, I'll tell you what.
[38:04.970 --> 38:08.990]  This will do nothing for us now, but maybe later.
[38:09.710 --> 38:10.710]  Probably not.
[38:11.050 --> 38:11.610]  Geoff!
[38:11.750 --> 38:13.230]  What the hell?
[38:13.590 --> 38:15.290]  You're a fucking psychopath.
[38:20.310 --> 38:20.870]  Fuck!
[38:21.310 --> 38:22.910]  Oh, so close.
[38:25.150 --> 38:26.410]  Oh shit, you're throwing me.
[38:27.470 --> 38:28.970]  Is that really what it does?
[38:29.250 --> 38:31.190]  Do you guys...
[38:34.100 --> 38:35.340]  That's really cool.
[38:35.360 --> 38:36.080]  Punch my cloaca.
[38:37.160 --> 38:37.760]  That's it.
[38:37.840 --> 38:38.500]  That's it.
[38:38.940 --> 38:39.580]  That's it.
[38:39.600 --> 38:40.460]  I'll come back for you.
[38:46.440 --> 38:48.280]  He didn't come back.
[38:50.840 --> 38:52.240]  You sound like a schmuck.
[38:52.240 --> 38:54.960]  The chat wants to know when we're gonna buy the rights to Farty, Eric.
[38:56.020 --> 38:57.380]  We will never own Farty.
[38:59.080 --> 39:01.080]  Well, he died several times, so...
[39:01.720 --> 39:02.400]  We hate Farty.
[39:02.400 --> 39:02.780]  We never saved him.
[39:03.580 --> 39:04.140]  We didn't save him.
[39:04.680 --> 39:06.140]  Some would argue we never really tried.
[39:07.540 --> 39:10.820]  Didn't? Honestly, I think mostly it was nobody knew what was going on.
[39:11.060 --> 39:13.880]  I feel like we tried, and then we even tried in German a little bit.
[39:14.060 --> 39:15.620]  Yeah, we definitely tried in German.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.820]  Definitely tried in German.
[39:18.260 --> 39:18.660]  Here.
[39:18.920 --> 39:19.540]  There we go.
[39:19.800 --> 39:21.460]  I mean, if you go full Deutsch, you're trying.
[39:22.220 --> 39:22.460]  Yep.
[39:23.480 --> 39:24.600]  Oh, Nick, that's great.
[39:27.720 --> 39:29.100]  You pushed me off!
[39:32.280 --> 39:33.360]  Oh, no!
[39:33.760 --> 39:33.980]  Okay.
[39:37.100 --> 39:38.360]  Come on, Eric!
[39:38.500 --> 39:39.040]  That's right.
[39:39.220 --> 39:41.620]  The two best rodents are here, baby!
[39:43.180 --> 39:45.100]  Top tier rodents!
[39:46.340 --> 39:50.260]  Ooh, fire.
[39:50.440 --> 39:51.640]  Oh, I got it.
[39:52.820 --> 39:53.620]  Wanna collab?
[39:57.300 --> 39:58.520]  Yeah, but I don't...
[39:58.520 --> 39:59.580]  Yeah, how do you wanna...
[39:59.580 --> 40:00.480]  Do you wanna put that there?
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.560]  I kinda want it up here.
[40:01.680 --> 40:02.580]  Come block like...
[40:02.580 --> 40:03.380]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:03.380 --> 40:04.060]  Yeah, do like a little...
[40:04.060 --> 40:04.760]  Yeah, there you go.
[40:05.120 --> 40:05.480]  Yeah.
[40:05.660 --> 40:06.200]  That's pretty cool.
[40:06.800 --> 40:08.560]  Oh, but now I can't collab with that side.
[40:08.940 --> 40:09.180]  Good.
[40:09.680 --> 40:09.920]  Okay.
[40:10.480 --> 40:12.120]  You're not allowed to be part of our collab.
[40:13.700 --> 40:14.500]  You suck.
[40:15.200 --> 40:16.380]  Push Gavin into that thing.
[40:18.420 --> 40:19.560]  Geoff almost got...
[40:20.120 --> 40:21.040]  How do I...
[40:21.040 --> 40:21.520]  There we go.
[40:21.980 --> 40:22.020]  Ah!
[40:22.360 --> 40:22.700]  Oh.
[40:24.980 --> 40:25.380]  Yeah.
[40:27.640 --> 40:28.880]  What do you say again?
[40:28.880 --> 40:31.940]  Oh, I missed it.
[40:32.020 --> 40:33.840]  Oh, God damn it.
[40:34.660 --> 40:35.460]  You can't...
[40:35.460 --> 40:36.740]  You have to stay on the top.
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.500]  Yeah, Nick, you got it.
[40:37.520 --> 40:38.040]  Nick, you got it.
[40:38.880 --> 40:39.540]  Come here!
[40:40.860 --> 40:41.720]  No, Nick!
[40:41.880 --> 40:42.140]  No!
[40:42.580 --> 40:43.280]  You panicked.
[40:43.320 --> 40:44.120]  You went Nick mode.
[40:45.700 --> 40:46.580]  No, it's not.
[40:46.740 --> 40:48.240]  You had it in hand.
[40:49.320 --> 40:50.740]  No winners, no points.
[40:51.940 --> 40:53.040]  I did have it in hand.
[40:53.060 --> 40:54.400]  None of this is bees!
[40:55.900 --> 40:57.040]  Maybe there's a no bee level.
[40:57.680 --> 40:58.560]  There's a bee-less level.
[40:59.060 --> 41:00.140]  Oh, I thought I grabbed something.
[41:00.140 --> 41:01.180]  Pick a fucking thing!
[41:01.360 --> 41:01.860]  I did.
[41:02.140 --> 41:03.060]  No, you didn't!
[41:09.380 --> 41:11.360]  How about a last ditch spot?
[41:11.620 --> 41:12.000]  There we go.
[41:14.540 --> 41:16.580]  Oh, that is practical.
[41:16.580 --> 41:17.020]  Oh, my God.
[41:17.220 --> 41:17.640]  There's a roof.
[41:18.460 --> 41:18.760]  Ah!
[41:19.660 --> 41:20.040]  Ah!
[41:21.120 --> 41:21.880]  Ding dong!
[41:22.340 --> 41:23.520]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[41:25.940 --> 41:26.320]  Ow!
[41:27.320 --> 41:27.700]  Ow!
[41:34.480 --> 41:35.660]  Oh, he's done me.
[41:35.780 --> 41:36.380]  He's done me!
[41:37.840 --> 41:38.460]  Break that.
[41:39.160 --> 41:39.600]  Yes!
[41:39.920 --> 41:40.620]  No, you didn't!
[41:41.060 --> 41:41.500]  Yes!
[41:41.920 --> 41:42.340]  Die!
[41:42.600 --> 41:42.960]  No!
[41:43.400 --> 41:43.740]  No!
[41:44.360 --> 41:45.340]  Get down there!
[41:46.020 --> 41:47.280]  Oh, he got me with the fire.
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.200]  He got me with the fire.
[41:51.080 --> 41:52.500]  The timing was all off.
[41:52.660 --> 41:52.880]  Damn.
[41:55.940 --> 41:57.300]  Really should have been stopping Nick.
[41:58.040 --> 41:58.480]  No!
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.400]  I got bees!
[41:59.400 --> 41:59.480]  I got bees!
[42:00.920 --> 42:01.860]  Oh, those were yours.
[42:01.960 --> 42:02.440]  Sorry, Eric.
[42:02.440 --> 42:03.020]  My bad.
[42:04.300 --> 42:05.420]  Get punched by a flower.
[42:05.860 --> 42:07.220]  Holy shit, Geoff.
[42:07.520 --> 42:08.720]  What are we gonna do now?
[42:09.380 --> 42:10.240]  Oh, my God.
[42:10.640 --> 42:11.480]  You're gonna be real good.
[42:12.460 --> 42:13.380]  Somebody put bees there.
[42:13.500 --> 42:14.280]  What are we supposed to do?
[42:14.420 --> 42:16.100]  We gotta bee-lieve in ourselves.
[42:19.340 --> 42:19.560]  Ah!
[42:20.120 --> 42:20.500]  Ah!
[42:22.780 --> 42:23.220]  Beekeeper.
[42:24.420 --> 42:25.780]  None of this is...
[42:25.780 --> 42:26.440]  Beekeeper!
[42:28.560 --> 42:29.000]  Ah!
[42:29.580 --> 42:29.980]  There you go.
[42:30.000 --> 42:30.640]  Oh, he made it!
[42:30.640 --> 42:31.240]  I got out!
[42:34.280 --> 42:35.080]  I fell.
[42:35.200 --> 42:36.040]  Oh, I'm freaking out now.
[42:36.840 --> 42:37.380]  Ah, fuck.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.040]  You got it.
[42:42.180 --> 42:43.020]  Don't blow it, Gavin.
[42:43.100 --> 42:44.100]  You got it.
[42:44.440 --> 42:44.780]  Solo!
[42:44.860 --> 42:45.800]  Oh, got it.
[42:45.800 --> 42:46.140]  Nice.
[42:46.560 --> 42:47.820]  A lot of points on that one.
[42:48.300 --> 42:49.000]  That was a good one, buddy.
[42:49.480 --> 42:49.700]  Yep.
[42:50.080 --> 42:51.260]  Good God.
[42:51.460 --> 42:52.160]  But not enough.
[42:54.000 --> 42:54.540]  Oh, oh!
[42:54.700 --> 42:54.900]  Hockey!
[42:55.540 --> 42:57.400]  There's no deletion tool here?
[42:57.600 --> 42:57.840]  Excellent.
[43:02.460 --> 43:04.660]  Oh, another last ditch effort.
[43:12.420 --> 43:12.980]  Oh!
[43:13.260 --> 43:13.820]  Well...
[43:13.820 --> 43:14.380]  Suck!
[43:17.340 --> 43:18.060]  Thanks, Geoff.
[43:18.180 --> 43:19.840]  You're a piece of shit, Eric.
[43:21.780 --> 43:22.900]  I'm trapped.
[43:23.080 --> 43:23.680]  I was stuck.
[43:23.880 --> 43:24.540]  What the fuck?
[43:25.700 --> 43:27.460]  You're stuck on a toilet shelf.
[43:27.980 --> 43:28.640]  I was.
[43:29.880 --> 43:30.440]  Ah!
[43:31.940 --> 43:33.320]  Just trying to get up there.
[43:37.080 --> 43:37.440]  What?
[43:37.640 --> 43:38.080]  There we go.
[43:38.600 --> 43:39.600]  How many more rounds?
[43:39.660 --> 43:40.740]  There's got to be like three more rounds, right?
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.000]  Oh, God, I don't know what to tell this.
[43:42.860 --> 43:42.980]  Oh!
[43:43.660 --> 43:44.500]  Yeah, we both got it.
[43:44.900 --> 43:45.440]  Yeah, we did.
[43:45.580 --> 43:46.980]  Why do you want it to constantly end?
[43:49.340 --> 43:49.720]  Yeah, why?
[43:49.720 --> 43:50.300]  Look at the whole thing, Eric.
[43:50.560 --> 43:51.680]  The whole thing's done!
[43:52.480 --> 43:52.640]  Hmm.
[43:53.220 --> 43:53.500]  Hmm.
[43:53.700 --> 43:53.760]  Huh.
[43:54.400 --> 43:54.580]  Hmm.
[43:54.900 --> 43:56.440]  Gavin shouldn't be asking so many questions.
[43:56.940 --> 43:57.340]  You know what?
[43:58.100 --> 43:58.320]  Hmm.
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.180]  Eric destroyed too much.
[44:01.340 --> 44:02.240]  I won't take.
[44:05.320 --> 44:06.900]  I fell in the water.
[44:06.900 --> 44:07.920]  You, Geoff!
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.160]  Oh, that was...
[44:09.160 --> 44:10.400]  That was your problem with me, wasn't it?
[44:10.860 --> 44:12.920]  You just landed on him.
[44:13.960 --> 44:14.480]  Hardcore.
[44:16.000 --> 44:17.400]  Watch out for that thing, Gavin!
[44:17.400 --> 44:18.760]  Oh, you just went into the water!
[44:19.900 --> 44:21.340]  I fucking skated right through it.
[44:21.980 --> 44:22.100]  Wow.
[44:22.100 --> 44:23.140]  Ah, you made it.
[44:23.560 --> 44:23.860]  Move!
[44:24.400 --> 44:26.000]  He got so scared to jump.
[44:26.960 --> 44:28.240]  Oh, he's going to win!
[44:28.400 --> 44:28.920]  Wow.
[44:29.520 --> 44:29.540]  Oh!
[44:29.760 --> 44:30.100]  Is he?
[44:30.620 --> 44:31.660]  Furry bastard!
[44:32.080 --> 44:32.440]  No!
[44:32.480 --> 44:32.700]  No!
[44:32.720 --> 44:34.340]  There will be no stopping the furry bastard!
[44:34.500 --> 44:34.640]  Oh!
[44:35.200 --> 44:35.360]  Oh!
[44:35.540 --> 44:35.760]  Geoff!
[44:36.080 --> 44:36.400]  Shit!
[44:36.960 --> 44:38.120]  Let's even it up a little bit.
[44:39.780 --> 44:40.920]  Who wants to ring the bell?
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.240]  Ring my bell!
[44:45.720 --> 44:46.500]  Oh, God!
[44:46.580 --> 44:47.500]  It's a firing squad.
[44:47.500 --> 44:48.340]  Ring my bell!
[44:50.600 --> 44:50.900]  Oh.
[44:51.100 --> 44:51.940]  Geoff sounds defeated.
[44:52.100 --> 44:52.300]  What?
[44:52.360 --> 44:53.440]  I'm gonna time my fucking life.
[44:53.920 --> 44:54.760]  That's the context.
[44:55.400 --> 44:55.980]  Holy shit!
[44:57.680 --> 44:58.740]  Oh, I thought I...
[44:58.740 --> 44:59.040]  Oh!
[44:59.580 --> 45:00.120]  That's a heartbreaker.
[45:00.120 --> 45:01.800]  I thought there was a short piece to jump on there.
[45:01.800 --> 45:02.440]  Damn it.
[45:02.600 --> 45:03.160]  Oh!
[45:03.540 --> 45:03.800]  Wow.
[45:04.460 --> 45:07.020]  This is an insane beginning.
[45:08.720 --> 45:09.620]  Two turns left.
[45:10.600 --> 45:11.480]  Plenty of time.
[45:12.860 --> 45:13.040]  Oh!
[45:16.800 --> 45:18.000]  I don't like that one.
[45:19.280 --> 45:20.220]  What was that?
[45:21.400 --> 45:22.260]  Something exploded.
[45:22.760 --> 45:24.240]  A thing that Nick put there.
[45:25.220 --> 45:26.340]  My finest work.
[45:29.690 --> 45:30.530]  Do something.
[45:30.690 --> 45:32.410]  No, Gavin, you'll block the guy.
[45:32.410 --> 45:34.410]  Oh, cool.
[45:35.590 --> 45:35.950]  Cool, man.
[45:36.010 --> 45:36.630]  Thanks for doing that.
[45:39.730 --> 45:40.210]  Oh!
[45:40.690 --> 45:42.350]  I don't remember where the...
[45:42.350 --> 45:42.790]  Fuck!
[45:43.030 --> 45:43.810]  Frickin' things are.
[45:44.790 --> 45:44.950]  Ah!
[45:47.970 --> 45:48.450]  No!
[45:48.970 --> 45:49.110]  No!
[45:51.010 --> 45:51.990]  Gotta go low.
[45:52.370 --> 45:52.530]  Yep.
[45:53.150 --> 45:53.990]  Oh, no, Nick!
[45:54.990 --> 45:55.310]  No.
[45:55.730 --> 45:56.190]  It's not enough.
[45:56.350 --> 45:56.610]  It's not enough.
[45:56.630 --> 45:57.070]  It's not enough.
[45:57.410 --> 45:57.650]  No!
[45:59.210 --> 46:00.170]  The coin!
[46:00.630 --> 46:00.930]  Fuck!
[46:02.410 --> 46:03.170]  Nick, what happened?
[46:04.590 --> 46:07.630]  The audience wants to know who we're rooting for in the Super Bowl.
[46:10.070 --> 46:12.870]  I think I'm rooting for just eating food at someone's house.
[46:13.030 --> 46:15.210]  Yeah, I couldn't fucking care less, honestly.
[46:15.290 --> 46:18.450]  I mean, I learned the rule of the sport today, so I'm pretty excited to watch it.
[46:18.730 --> 46:21.890]  We did talk about maybe doing like a Super Bowl watch-along together or something.
[46:22.570 --> 46:25.210]  Oh, Jungle Temple has a exclamation... a question.
[46:27.310 --> 46:28.490]  He just... he's saying something.
[46:28.550 --> 46:29.210]  So does Pyramid.
[46:29.250 --> 46:30.010]  That's why I came here.
[46:30.530 --> 46:30.750]  Oh, yeah.
[46:32.610 --> 46:38.070]  I'm not even rooting for the Eagles, but I like saying go birds, like a Philly dirt bag, so that's fun.
[46:38.270 --> 46:40.330]  Like, that's it. That's the only thing that I like.
[46:40.650 --> 46:45.030]  Jalen Hurts and Devonta Smith played for Alabama, so I guess I got that going for me.
[46:45.270 --> 46:48.250]  Saquon Barkley winning a Super Bowl after getting cut is...
[46:48.250 --> 46:48.890]  Nah, pretty cool.
[46:48.970 --> 46:51.970]  I like getting, like, not re-signed is very funny.
[46:52.330 --> 46:54.450]  I think that's pretty... that's pretty great.
[46:54.670 --> 46:57.010]  You're a Eagles fan, right, Nick? Or is it just the Phillies?
[46:57.270 --> 46:57.310]  Nope.
[46:57.310 --> 46:57.850]  Just the Phillies?
[46:57.930 --> 46:58.950]  Cowboys. Yeah, just the Phillies.
[46:59.290 --> 47:01.390]  You're a Cowboys fan. That's... oh.
[47:01.390 --> 47:02.550]  That's so embarrassing.
[47:03.770 --> 47:04.870]  It is so embarrassing.
[47:05.170 --> 47:06.890]  It's like being a White Sox fan in 2025.
[47:07.550 --> 47:09.170]  I fucking hate that man.
[47:10.310 --> 47:11.570]  What about his evil sons?
[47:12.550 --> 47:13.470]  They'll be just as good.
[47:14.830 --> 47:15.690]  What do we get?
[47:16.810 --> 47:17.850]  Volcano for Nick.
[47:18.170 --> 47:19.050]  Oh, Nick, you got a volcano.
[47:19.370 --> 47:20.290]  Yay! Thanks, guys.
[47:21.030 --> 47:21.990]  You motherfucker.
[47:22.470 --> 47:25.030]  Me? You! You did that!
[47:25.150 --> 47:27.150]  That was not me. That was not me.
[47:27.170 --> 47:29.130]  You jumped on me, you moron.
[47:30.250 --> 47:32.510]  I dropped down on the thing and then you knocked me right off.
[47:35.470 --> 47:36.110]  Sabotage style.
[47:36.270 --> 47:37.070]  Why would you do that?
[47:38.070 --> 47:39.170]  Are you an idiot? What are you doing?
[47:44.590 --> 47:46.650]  Well, well, well, if it isn't Gavin.
[47:47.870 --> 47:52.690]  Although there is the... like the audience points out, it is historic to 3Pete.
[47:52.770 --> 47:53.870]  And that is something that's never been done.
[47:53.990 --> 47:55.970]  So you always kind of see history.
[47:56.930 --> 47:57.790]  Who gives a shit?
[47:58.110 --> 47:58.850]  Well, there you go, audience.
[47:58.850 --> 48:00.230]  They don't give a shit.
[48:00.450 --> 48:00.970]  Who cares?
[48:02.530 --> 48:04.030]  Historic to 3Pete?
[48:04.450 --> 48:06.410]  I'm just saying what they're saying in the audience.
[48:07.850 --> 48:10.710]  I don't know. It's fine. I don't care.
[48:10.990 --> 48:15.170]  If it was my team, hell yeah. It's not. I don't care.
[48:16.430 --> 48:17.670]  3Pete, get out of here.
[48:18.270 --> 48:19.790]  There you go. Get out of here.
[48:21.470 --> 48:22.570]  Oh, god damn it.
[48:23.190 --> 48:24.270]  Let go a run.
[48:24.670 --> 48:26.290]  Oh, no, he's the ghost.
[48:26.610 --> 48:27.070]  Yeah, he's dead.
[48:27.550 --> 48:28.550]  And it can't activate it.
[48:29.270 --> 48:29.790]  Ah, shit.
[48:29.950 --> 48:30.430]  Oh, what's up, Geoff?
[48:30.770 --> 48:31.250]  Hey, what's up?
[48:31.470 --> 48:31.850]  What are we doing?
[48:32.550 --> 48:33.810]  I'm just fucking waiting.
[48:36.810 --> 48:37.610]  Are you sleeping?
[48:43.470 --> 48:45.110]  Okay, at some point, I'm going to need to...
[48:45.110 --> 48:45.270]  Okay.
[48:45.710 --> 48:46.250]  God damn it.
[48:46.570 --> 48:47.570]  That's what I was trying to avoid.
[48:47.750 --> 48:48.330]  I was trying...
[48:51.070 --> 48:51.890]  No, you got him.
[48:52.370 --> 48:52.990]  There we go.
[48:53.150 --> 48:54.850]  Got him. Got him. Got him.
[48:54.930 --> 48:56.070]  Got him. Got him. Got him.
[48:56.070 --> 48:56.650]  Nice job, Eric.
[48:56.990 --> 48:57.390]  Fucking excellent.
[49:03.410 --> 49:06.110]  Somebody asked why I like the Phillies.
[49:06.990 --> 49:10.290]  My family's from there, but I grew up here in... well, in San Antonio.
[49:10.430 --> 49:13.790]  So, I like the Cowboys and I like the Phillies.
[49:13.870 --> 49:16.230]  I thought it was cream cheese related.
[49:17.170 --> 49:17.710]  Oh, I love Philadelphia.
[49:17.950 --> 49:20.790]  I used to eat cream cheese with a spoon as a kid.
[49:21.130 --> 49:21.670]  Oh, my god.
[49:22.390 --> 49:23.330]  And you were like...
[49:23.870 --> 49:26.730]  He would eat cream cheese with a spoon and go...
[49:28.170 --> 49:28.590]  Alone.
[49:28.970 --> 49:29.770]  Solo, baby.
[49:30.390 --> 49:31.050]  Spoon it out.
[49:31.050 --> 49:31.750]  Oh!
[49:31.990 --> 49:33.470]  Thought I timed it better than that.
[49:33.510 --> 49:34.210]  Fuck! I keep forgetting!
[49:34.510 --> 49:34.770]  Shit!
[49:35.050 --> 49:36.430]  Gavin Goo's dead, too.
[49:36.730 --> 49:36.990]  Yep.
[49:37.250 --> 49:37.810]  Damn it.
[49:39.490 --> 49:41.370]  Oh, I think I know what I'm doing next round.
[49:46.490 --> 49:47.790]  None of this is bees.
[49:48.610 --> 49:49.310]  It is true.
[49:52.230 --> 49:53.330]  Get rid of this.
[49:54.650 --> 49:55.810]  What? What are you getting rid of?
[49:55.870 --> 49:56.250]  No.
[49:57.370 --> 49:58.650]  Oh, my god!
[49:59.510 --> 49:59.950]  Wow.
[50:00.430 --> 50:00.890]  Wow.
[50:03.390 --> 50:04.650]  Oh, yeah, there you go.
[50:04.710 --> 50:04.770]  Wow.
[50:06.230 --> 50:06.890]  Give me that.
[50:08.750 --> 50:11.210]  No! Die, you bastard! Die!
[50:11.750 --> 50:12.610]  Where is everyone?
[50:13.010 --> 50:13.430]  Oh, shit!
[50:13.770 --> 50:14.310]  Ah, twat!
[50:15.310 --> 50:16.010]  Damn it.
[50:19.170 --> 50:19.910]  Hell yeah.
[50:20.390 --> 50:20.810]  Get out of here.
[50:28.490 --> 50:31.970]  We're 13 mere minutes away from the best time of the week.
[50:32.250 --> 50:33.110]  That's pretty exciting.
[50:33.550 --> 50:33.730]  Yep.
[50:33.850 --> 50:35.150]  Oh, we both got a black hole.
[50:35.510 --> 50:35.750]  Ooh.
[50:37.590 --> 50:40.470]  Ooh, I want to mess with whoever's right there.
[50:40.890 --> 50:43.230]  Oh, Gavin, that's a good one. I like that.
[50:43.690 --> 50:44.430]  That's great, Gavin.
[50:44.510 --> 50:45.350]  Oh, my god, Geoff.
[50:45.530 --> 50:46.570]  Geoff, that's insane.
[50:46.770 --> 50:47.090]  Thank you.
[50:47.210 --> 50:48.870]  Geoff, that's fucking crazy.
[50:49.350 --> 50:49.470]  No!
[50:49.690 --> 50:50.090]  Thank you.
[50:50.250 --> 50:50.510]  No!
[50:50.510 --> 50:51.510]  Oh, god damn it, Nick.
[50:52.330 --> 50:53.070]  You guys are too good.
[50:53.070 --> 50:56.510]  Nick, look, I died, but I have to blame someone, so...
[50:56.510 --> 50:57.250]  Why'd you do that?
[50:58.310 --> 50:58.930]  Get it, Gavin.
[51:00.370 --> 51:01.010]  Let's go!
[51:01.210 --> 51:02.350]  No, no, move!
[51:03.130 --> 51:03.950]  Get him, stop him!
[51:04.090 --> 51:04.770]  We got him.
[51:04.990 --> 51:05.710]  We got him.
[51:05.790 --> 51:06.610]  Easy mode, baby.
[51:06.890 --> 51:07.410]  We got him.
[51:07.590 --> 51:08.250]  Dumbass bird.
[51:11.610 --> 51:12.750]  Stupid fucking bird.
[51:14.650 --> 51:15.930]  Stupid fucking bird.
[51:16.250 --> 51:18.450]  This game never gives me the other half of the pool.
[51:18.570 --> 51:19.110]  It's absurd.
[51:19.110 --> 51:20.290]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[51:21.170 --> 51:23.230]  Yeah, it's pretty crazy, I feel like.
[51:24.350 --> 51:25.270]  That's absurd.
[51:27.250 --> 51:28.110]  Oh, goo!
[51:29.950 --> 51:31.990]  You piece of shit!
[51:34.470 --> 51:35.370]  You fucking...
[51:35.670 --> 51:38.010]  Alright, boys, let's see how we do.
[51:38.670 --> 51:39.570]  Go, Eric, go!
[51:39.590 --> 51:40.110]  Oh, wankstaining.
[51:41.590 --> 51:42.490]  No, look, I helped you.
[51:42.810 --> 51:43.350]  He's doing it!
[51:43.350 --> 51:44.110]  Oh, Eric!
[51:45.550 --> 51:46.150]  Yes!
[51:46.550 --> 51:46.950]  Yes!
[51:47.830 --> 51:48.210]  No!
[51:48.210 --> 51:48.670]  Wow!
[51:50.370 --> 51:51.570]  Look at that!
[51:51.650 --> 51:52.710]  Is that how you do it, boys?
[51:53.790 --> 51:55.690]  Well done, Eric, well done.
[51:55.730 --> 51:56.590]  Thank you very much.
[51:57.750 --> 51:58.490]  Let's see you do it again.
[51:58.970 --> 52:01.110]  Let's see you do it again.
[52:03.090 --> 52:04.210]  What does the cannon do?
[52:04.610 --> 52:05.370]  Does it fire you?
[52:05.530 --> 52:06.190]  Yeah, it fires you.
[52:07.350 --> 52:08.490]  Getting rid of the black hole.
[52:08.830 --> 52:10.530]  That was my black hole too, I don't want it there.
[52:14.450 --> 52:15.890]  A little too far, a little too far.
[52:17.430 --> 52:18.210]  Get him.
[52:18.930 --> 52:19.770]  Got him.
[52:20.510 --> 52:22.090]  Geoff, get in the...
[52:22.090 --> 52:23.210]  Get in the cannon.
[52:24.170 --> 52:25.070]  Go for it.
[52:29.170 --> 52:30.090]  Eric, go get him!
[52:30.310 --> 52:30.910]  I'm waiting.
[52:31.770 --> 52:32.110]  There you go.
[52:32.290 --> 52:32.690]  Well done.
[52:32.730 --> 52:33.410]  Anyone else next?
[52:33.830 --> 52:34.230]  Come get him.
[52:34.690 --> 52:35.230]  Welcome to the sla...
[52:35.230 --> 52:36.590]  Bring your daughter to the slaughter, let's go.
[52:37.590 --> 52:38.270]  Holy shit!
[52:38.450 --> 52:38.710]  Ho!
[52:41.810 --> 52:43.470]  This is gonna be tricky.
[52:44.010 --> 52:45.010]  Whoa, holy shit!
[52:45.010 --> 52:46.890]  Ah, you can still use the cannon!
[52:47.630 --> 52:48.510]  Move, move!
[52:51.130 --> 52:51.890]  Oh no!
[52:52.070 --> 52:53.550]  On my screen, he got...
[52:53.550 --> 52:54.010]  No!
[52:54.430 --> 53:00.430]  On my screen, he hit the buzzsaw, he hit the black hole, that was bullshit.
[53:00.770 --> 53:03.170]  I can't believe this horse shit.
[53:03.670 --> 53:04.110]  Unbelievable.
[53:05.030 --> 53:05.470]  Unbelievable.
[53:05.470 --> 53:06.570]  Well, we have time for...
[53:06.570 --> 53:09.690]  I think we have time for one more, it's 4.50, we're getting close.
[53:09.910 --> 53:12.910]  Yeah, we can go to 5.01, I don't care what Andrew says, we'll do it.
[53:12.910 --> 53:16.830]  Yeah, I wish he would stop telling us, he's like, no, no.
[53:17.030 --> 53:20.070]  He said, start exactly on time and end early.
[53:20.310 --> 53:20.790]  And we're like, why?
[53:21.090 --> 53:23.750]  And it's like, don't you want to hang out with the fans, baby?
[53:23.850 --> 53:29.310]  Don't you want to hang out with IM Mark and Helplopolis Sage and the Magus?
[53:29.610 --> 53:31.310]  Don't forget about Joey Spesh.
[53:31.530 --> 53:34.170]  Dude, I almost forgot about Dreamsky1702.
[53:34.650 --> 53:37.250]  Probably Mark the Frog and Rebecca and a bunch of other people.
[53:37.750 --> 53:39.950]  Guys, you know about Mark the Frog, fuck yeah.
[53:40.270 --> 53:41.230]  Yeah, dude.
[53:41.350 --> 53:42.270]  We love Mark the Frog.
[53:43.390 --> 53:44.190]  Ribbit, ribbit.
[53:44.670 --> 53:48.010]  He turned me on to a really good protein powder that I really enjoy, it's great.
[53:48.450 --> 53:50.250]  You could have just stopped it, he turned you on.
[53:50.610 --> 53:52.410]  Mark the Frog turned me on, baby.
[53:53.550 --> 53:54.530]  Hey, well done, Mark.
[53:54.750 --> 53:55.250]  On the top.
[53:55.570 --> 53:55.890]  There you go.
[53:56.150 --> 53:57.530]  Yeah, just trying to ice the ceiling.
[54:01.480 --> 54:02.080]  What'd we get?
[54:02.100 --> 54:02.500]  What'd we get?
[54:03.460 --> 54:04.260]  A chameleon!
[54:05.380 --> 54:06.040]  For me?
[54:07.480 --> 54:09.140]  You've... just... unbelievable!
[54:09.140 --> 54:09.300]  Unbelievable!
[54:12.740 --> 54:13.980]  Oh, Geoff.
[54:15.840 --> 54:16.320]  Hello.
[54:20.380 --> 54:22.640]  Only the good rodents made it this time, baby.
[54:23.060 --> 54:23.620]  Only the goodies.
[54:25.480 --> 54:26.180]  Sorry, Gavin.
[54:26.180 --> 54:27.960]  You can't flush this turtle down the toilet.
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.180]  I would love it if there was bees.
[54:31.580 --> 54:36.560]  The audience keeps saying, like, how long do they realize they can change what spawns and the rate of spawns?
[54:36.580 --> 54:39.380]  But I don't want to do that.
[54:39.380 --> 54:43.140]  We want natural bees, that's a great point.
[54:43.500 --> 54:45.340]  Yeah, you live and die by the game.
[54:45.580 --> 54:46.460]  Like, that's the point.
[54:46.660 --> 54:47.400]  Natural bees is the point.
[54:47.420 --> 54:48.980]  That's why you have to keep hoping for bees.
[54:50.480 --> 54:52.280]  Oh, twat! I forgot about that.
[54:52.460 --> 54:53.520]  It's like praying for rain.
[54:55.100 --> 54:55.980]  Oh my gosh.
[54:56.240 --> 54:56.640]  Gavin, get out of here.
[54:57.000 --> 54:57.260]  Gavin!
[54:58.080 --> 54:58.580]  Gavin!
[54:58.920 --> 55:00.240]  You're slapping me around!
[55:00.360 --> 55:01.440]  Leave me alone!
[55:02.780 --> 55:03.280]  Gavin!
[55:05.520 --> 55:07.100]  Oh, Geoff.
[55:07.100 --> 55:08.440]  Oh, Geoff, I'm sorry!
[55:09.540 --> 55:10.300]  Fuckin' Nick.
[55:16.110 --> 55:17.210]  Don't let him do it!
[55:17.710 --> 55:18.190]  Yes!
[55:18.690 --> 55:20.390]  Only the good ones make it, baby!
[55:22.710 --> 55:23.670]  Yes, yes!
[55:23.730 --> 55:24.710]  Wow, a lot of trap points.
[55:25.050 --> 55:26.250]  I'm gonna get me some underdog.
[55:28.450 --> 55:29.290]  What's underdog?
[55:30.170 --> 55:31.130]  She's a...
[55:31.650 --> 55:34.070]  A very nice woman who shows up at...
[55:34.070 --> 55:35.090]  Oh shit, Nick.
[55:35.370 --> 55:36.170]  We should collab with Geoff.
[55:36.170 --> 55:36.990]  Parades around the Northeast.
[55:36.990 --> 55:37.730]  Yes, we should, Geoff!
[55:38.390 --> 55:39.850]  In a red shirt with a cape.
[55:40.850 --> 55:41.870]  I kinda like where he's at.
[55:41.870 --> 55:42.650]  You guys wanna collaborate?
[55:43.190 --> 55:44.570]  Yeah, we wanna go to either end.
[55:44.950 --> 55:46.150]  Alright, here, I'm gonna put it right here.
[55:46.170 --> 55:46.730]  Oh my god!
[55:46.890 --> 55:48.010]  How do I...
[55:48.010 --> 55:49.330]  How do I flip sideways?
[55:49.650 --> 55:49.930]  Bumpers.
[55:49.950 --> 55:50.530]  Hold X.
[55:50.630 --> 55:50.810]  Bumper.
[55:54.830 --> 55:56.730]  You can almost do it!
[55:56.850 --> 55:57.370]  Come on, buddy!
[55:57.870 --> 55:58.350]  Yeah, but you'll...
[55:58.350 --> 55:59.330]  Way to go!
[55:59.610 --> 56:01.050]  I couldn't see, I couldn't see!
[56:01.170 --> 56:02.150]  It was blocked by the numbers!
[56:02.430 --> 56:02.990]  I couldn't see!
[56:03.190 --> 56:03.650]  Awesome, man!
[56:03.670 --> 56:04.370]  That rocked!
[56:05.670 --> 56:06.390]  Holy shit!
[56:06.570 --> 56:07.410]  It does rock!
[56:07.430 --> 56:07.910]  Look at it!
[56:07.910 --> 56:08.590]  It's hell!
[56:08.590 --> 56:12.410]  What's this goddamn bullshit that I want this stream to end early?
[56:13.050 --> 56:14.350]  What are you talking about?
[56:14.750 --> 56:15.530]  Andrew's here!
[56:15.650 --> 56:16.550]  Oh, it's early in!
[56:16.610 --> 56:17.770]  It's early in today, Andrew!
[56:17.770 --> 56:19.170]  I didn't send any texts!
[56:19.390 --> 56:19.830]  This is lies!
[56:20.410 --> 56:20.930]  Lies!
[56:21.990 --> 56:23.370]  Lies from these men!
[56:23.990 --> 56:24.210]  Comeback!
[56:24.210 --> 56:24.690]  Oh, what?
[56:25.010 --> 56:26.270]  You don't deserve it!
[56:26.610 --> 56:27.150]  What do you mean?
[56:27.170 --> 56:28.490]  You don't deserve the comeback!
[56:28.750 --> 56:33.130]  Andrew, we need to figure out how to play this game where, uh...
[56:33.130 --> 56:39.450]  The audience allows us to have different items and stuff.
[56:39.650 --> 56:40.950]  I think that's gonna be...
[56:40.950 --> 56:42.710]  Apparently, that's something that can happen here.
[56:42.790 --> 56:44.010]  We're very excited about it.
[56:44.110 --> 56:44.910]  Look at this creation.
[56:45.070 --> 56:45.350]  That's really cool.
[56:45.350 --> 56:45.890]  Look at this abomination.
[56:47.690 --> 56:48.650]  I'll look into that.
[56:49.050 --> 56:49.670]  Oh my god.
[56:49.810 --> 56:50.330]  Oh my god!
[56:50.330 --> 56:51.330]  Oh my god!
[56:51.430 --> 56:52.250]  It's crazy!
[56:53.770 --> 56:55.470]  It's hard to tell which way it's facing.
[56:56.170 --> 56:56.610]  No!
[56:59.710 --> 56:59.970]  No!
[57:00.830 --> 57:01.270]  Yes!
[57:01.270 --> 57:01.310]  Yes!
[57:01.670 --> 57:03.670]  I can't believe I overshot that.
[57:03.950 --> 57:06.130]  Ms. M-razzle-dazzle.
[57:06.370 --> 57:07.270]  Mrazzle-dazzle?
[57:07.430 --> 57:07.690]  Whatever.
[57:08.950 --> 57:10.430]  Thank you for the subs, guys.
[57:10.710 --> 57:11.270]  Thanks for watching.
[57:11.390 --> 57:12.290]  Way to go, Geoff.
[57:12.870 --> 57:15.370]  Getting on to the best time of the week, 5.01.
[57:15.610 --> 57:16.890]  It is 4.54.
[57:18.130 --> 57:19.170]  Andrew, how are you?
[57:19.370 --> 57:19.990]  Andrew, how are you?
[57:20.610 --> 57:22.250]  I feel like death, but I'm good.
[57:22.670 --> 57:23.070]  That's cool.
[57:23.110 --> 57:23.930]  I heard lies.
[57:24.030 --> 57:24.790]  I was watching the stream.
[57:24.910 --> 57:25.730]  You guys are doing great, Geoff.
[57:25.730 --> 57:26.430]  I'm proud of you.
[57:26.790 --> 57:27.510]  Get my foot in!
[57:27.730 --> 57:28.370]  Get my foot in!
[57:28.610 --> 57:29.370]  Push my foot in!
[57:29.370 --> 57:30.610]  Push it in!
[57:31.410 --> 57:32.590]  Ah, shit!
[57:33.070 --> 57:33.730]  There we go.
[57:34.230 --> 57:34.970]  Almost there.
[57:35.250 --> 57:36.210]  Nick's gonna win!
[57:36.730 --> 57:37.870]  It's great to hear your voice, Andrew.
[57:38.270 --> 57:40.030]  It's so good to hear your voice, Andrew.
[57:40.190 --> 57:43.410]  We were talking earlier about how much fun we had today doing drafts.
[57:43.410 --> 57:44.210]  Oh, so much fun.
[57:44.330 --> 57:45.190]  Yeah, all the stuff we did.
[57:45.190 --> 57:46.230]  I can't wait for people to hear this.
[57:46.230 --> 57:48.230]  How Eric was irrationally angry with me.
[57:54.100 --> 57:55.820]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[57:56.080 --> 57:57.520]  I got places to beat it.
[57:57.780 --> 57:58.880]  Gavin, you piece of shit!
[58:00.580 --> 58:02.080]  You can't, you can't win.
[58:04.080 --> 58:05.180]  You can't win.
[58:05.400 --> 58:06.100]  Oh, I did it!
[58:06.260 --> 58:06.860]  I won!
[58:07.120 --> 58:07.780]  I won!
[58:07.920 --> 58:08.860]  God damn it.
[58:10.360 --> 58:11.380]  Who can I kill?
[58:11.580 --> 58:12.040]  Oh, Gavin's already.
[58:12.040 --> 58:12.480]  Yes!
[58:13.200 --> 58:13.840]  There's Nick.
[58:14.180 --> 58:14.920]  There's Nick!
[58:15.400 --> 58:15.800]  Get him!
[58:16.240 --> 58:16.620]  No!
[58:16.960 --> 58:17.100]  Geoff!
[58:22.380 --> 58:22.900]  No!
[58:23.120 --> 58:23.640]  Yes!
[58:23.700 --> 58:24.660]  So close!
[58:26.720 --> 58:27.160]  Woo!
[58:30.580 --> 58:31.840]  Feel the rush.
[58:32.260 --> 58:33.180]  Caught in a trap.
[58:42.340 --> 58:45.420]  Oh, Goo Head.
[58:47.140 --> 58:47.800]  Oh, we can't.
[58:47.800 --> 58:48.340]  What did you?
[58:48.780 --> 58:49.460]  What did you?
[58:49.720 --> 58:50.900]  You actually can't win now.
[58:51.220 --> 58:51.840]  Oh, we'll see.
[58:52.860 --> 58:55.660]  We can't let Eric win, ever.
[58:55.920 --> 58:56.200]  Oh, shit.
[58:59.980 --> 59:01.500]  Oh, I got it!
[59:01.500 --> 59:02.380]  I win!
[59:02.660 --> 59:02.940]  How?
[59:03.300 --> 59:03.360]  I win!
[59:03.540 --> 59:03.820]  How?
[59:04.720 --> 59:05.020]  Raccoon!
[59:05.900 --> 59:06.840]  Gotta get it, Gavin.
[59:07.180 --> 59:08.260]  How did he do it?
[59:09.620 --> 59:10.460]  Raccoon, baby!
[59:11.220 --> 59:11.460]  Go!
[59:11.740 --> 59:12.760]  But he's in the way.
[59:13.020 --> 59:13.160]  Ah!
[59:15.900 --> 59:16.860]  God damn!
[59:17.300 --> 59:18.800]  That's how you do it!
[59:19.340 --> 59:19.480]  Woo!
[59:19.480 --> 59:20.900]  That's not even 5-0-1!
[59:21.440 --> 59:23.080]  Damn, we gotta play one more.
[59:23.420 --> 59:23.540]  Bonus round!
[59:23.860 --> 59:26.980]  I mean, unless Andrew tells us that we have to, like, shut it down early.
[59:28.420 --> 59:30.300]  Oh, yeah, now that he's on...
[59:30.300 --> 59:33.520]  Now that he's here in person, his tune changes.
[59:33.520 --> 59:33.800]  Oh, wow!
[59:34.100 --> 59:35.700]  Dude, he's, like, really changing his tune for Mario.
[59:35.880 --> 59:36.320]  That's crazy.
[59:36.320 --> 59:37.500]  I think you guys should double the extent.
[59:37.700 --> 59:38.820]  I think the people are loving it.
[59:39.360 --> 59:39.980]  Toxic Tower?
[59:40.780 --> 59:42.580]  Alright, Toxic Tower is what we're gonna end it on.
[59:42.680 --> 59:45.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[59:45.360 --> 59:47.540]  This has been a really fun stream.
[59:48.240 --> 59:50.840]  All my rats are out here going crazy mode.
[59:51.140 --> 59:52.220]  Guys, you're doing great.
[59:52.360 --> 59:53.040]  This is awesome.
[59:53.220 --> 59:55.620]  It is almost 5-0-1, the best time of the week.
[59:56.440 --> 59:57.480]  Appreciate you being here.
[59:57.480 --> 59:59.140]  This looks fucked up.
[59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.800]  Dude, I've never seen it.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.800]  Uh, yeah, hang on.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.880]  I think I can.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.300]  This is not cool.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:07.500]  It's not totally fine.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.760]  Um, ooh, it's not letting me...
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.780]  Oh, screens? Capture?
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.800]  I don't think it's letting me.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:14.740]  Oh, no problem.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:15.820]  Sorry, man.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.360]  That's fine, I'll just be... I'll be on delay.
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.160]  I'm still watching.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.480]  Share screen.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.400]  I don't think I've played this level.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:25.520]  Is it...
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:25.780]  There's some way.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.400]  Can you... Can you see this, Andrew?
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:27.720]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.040]  Did that work?
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:29.560]  Do we have to go...
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.820]  Do we have to jump over this?
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.500]  Yeah, I can see it.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:32.740]  It's filling.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:33.940]  Oh!
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:35.520]  Oh!
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:36.880]  What is this?
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:37.600]  I had to see...
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600]  Oh, it's poison.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.240]  It's poison.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.640]  Is this Ivan Ooze's home?
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.540]  What the fuck?
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.740]  Yeah, this is where Ivan Ooze lives.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.020]  Oh, we're leaping to our dooms as we speak.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.320]  This is how they made the Joker.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.020]  Yeah.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.040]  They made the Joker.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.400]  Joker 2, specifically?
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.120]  Yep.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.280]  I got a door?
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:58.760]  Fuck.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.860]  You didn't want a door?
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.240]  No, I thought I got the slidey thingy.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.060]  There you go.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.240]  There we go.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:05.620]  You know what?
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.740]  Last ditch effort.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.040]  A rare Gavin-Eric collab up there.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.560]  I like it.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.180]  No, you're throwing me.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:15.860]  You've...
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.220]  Oh!
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:17.940]  I got Nick!
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:18.460]  What a show!
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.520]  Oh, Nick, you idiot.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.040]  Geoff could get the solo.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:21.480]  Go, go!
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.740]  Oh, Geoff!
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.420]  It's still slippery!
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.940]  We've been turning on ghosts, Andrew.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.060]  Okay.
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.560]  This is like my new favorite way to play.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.280]  Oh, really?
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.060]  After you die, ghosts.
[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.120]  Oh, yeah, you just fuck each other in the mouth.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:34.380]  Yeah.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.540]  You can, like, interact with each other as the ghosts?
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:39.840]  Yes.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.980]  The ghosts, like, you can bump into everyone.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:43.620]  It's awesome.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:43.960]  Oh, no!
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.400]  You can bunch people.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.980]  It's so good.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:47.600]  It rocks.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.600]  It's really good.
[01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.110]  Holy shit.
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.710]  Shit.
[01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:55.070]  Dick.
[01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:56.290]  Thanks, Nick.
[01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.930]  Go, go, go!
[01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.110]  I saved myself.
[01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.850]  How do I use this?
[01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.230]  I missed everything!
[01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.650]  Oh, Eric!
[01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:05.750]  I missed all this, Andrew.
[01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.210]  I was going for it.
[01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.190]  I felt so good.
[01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:08.790]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.250]  Dude, you did great.
[01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.970]  That's genius.
[01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:12.190]  I did the same thing.
[01:02:12.370 --> 01:02:13.150]  I did the same thing.
[01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.070]  How did you...
[01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.110]  Die.
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:15.370]  What?
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.090]  Where do you have to go to score?
[01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:18.190]  That's it.
[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:19.190]  Wow.
[01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.110]  You gotta run as fast as you can all the way to the right heart.
[01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.590]  Heart, heart.
[01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:24.790]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.770]  That was insane.
[01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.430]  Go, Geoff!
[01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:29.650]  I was scared of the purple goo.
[01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.710]  So close.
[01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:33.390]  Yeah, it'll do it.
[01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:34.570]  It'll goo it.
[01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:36.170]  Oh, here we go.
[01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:37.330]  Damn it.
[01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:38.030]  Damn it.
[01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:38.910]  Damn it.
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.490]  Let's make this more interesting.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.240]  Well, that's not gonna happen.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:47.720]  There we go.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.200]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:50.860]  This is crazy.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.840]  That's a nightmare.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.280]  Holy shit.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.040]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:55.740]  Oh, damn!
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:57.840]  Squirrel!
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.840]  Move! Get off my head!
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.420]  We gotta go!
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.480]  You idiots!
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.000]  There's plenty of time.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:08.320]  Hello.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.340]  Wait.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.000]  Wait for the goo.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:10.500]  Okay.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.760]  Oh, the door!
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.400]  Heart right.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:15.880]  There you go.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.620]  Good job, dude.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.200]  Really good work.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.440]  Really, really good work.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.300]  501!
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.020]  501!
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.140]  Bees!
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.640]  501 in bees!
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.260]  Oh, that's fucking great.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:29.860]  Bee activation begins!
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:30.780]  No, Gavin!
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.540]  Where are the bees?
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.740]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.140]  Gavin, no, put it above.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:37.900]  Oh, you're crazy.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.540]  How are we gonna...
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:39.780]  It's doable.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:41.740]  Okay.
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:42.180]  Baby.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:44.420]  Last ditch.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.180]  Oh, I love that.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:46.860]  Yeah.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:51.600]  Oh, no!
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.220]  Uh-oh.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.500]  Bees activate!
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.240]  Oh, no, the bees!
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:55.600]  Go get them!
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.320]  Go bees!
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.360]  Go get them!
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.080]  Stuck on the other side!
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:58.800]  Get them!
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.620]  The bees did it, baby!
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.220]  Nick, I love you with his ass.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:03.640]  Nick!
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:05.920]  Nick!
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.560]  I was like, well, let me just see where Gavin's ghost is.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.460]  And then I casually walked into it.
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:11.980]  Bees!
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:12.740]  Oh.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.760]  Oh, poor little guy.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:14.540]  Ooh!
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:15.740]  Oh!
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.760]  Uh-oh!
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.020]  Holy shit.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.280]  Enough bees?
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.180]  You can't...
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:22.500]  Gavin!
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.420]  Gavin!
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.480]  Gavin!
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.780]  Local honey!
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.480]  Bye, local!
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:32.960]  Bye, Nick!
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.640]  Oh!
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:35.820]  Bees!
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.080]  Go bees!
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.180]  You gotta go, Nick!
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.200]  Keep going!
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.840]  Get all the bees!
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:41.660]  Get all the bees!
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.040]  Holy shit!
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.080]  They're all the bees on the planet!
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.460]  That was insane.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.300]  I got it!
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.300]  Nice, Eric!
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.340]  Ghost him up!
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.620]  Oh, Gavin's sneaky with that little...
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.920]  Oh, he got it!
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.300]  He got it.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.040]  He got it.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.880]  He got it.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.680]  You gotta do something about that little platform.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:02.100]  He's really...
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.400]  Ah, damn.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.420]  Ah, damn!
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.880]  Every single thing I wanted.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:07.820]  Get the bees.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:08.800]  Yes!
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.800]  Yes, Eric!
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:11.520]  Fear them.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.620]  Fear them!
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.240]  Where did you put them now?
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:15.800]  No!
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.420]  I'm the beekeeper, Nick!
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:17.920]  Gavin!
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.420]  Gavin!
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.280]  He loves to mess up the start.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.460]  It doesn't matter to him.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:26.440]  Oh!
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.780]  I didn't even notice that!
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:28.240]  Look!
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:28.880]  Ah!
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.860]  Oh, goddammit!
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:32.940]  God!
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:33.620]  God!
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:33.920]  God!
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.100]  God!
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.640]  God!
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.180]  Oh, my god.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.240]  Alright, we got this.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.240]  We got this!
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.140]  Hey, Andrew, thanks for changing your mind and letting us play past 5 o'clock.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:48.280]  Yeah, dude, I appreciate it.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:49.060]  Yeah, dude, thanks.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.680]  You're welcome.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.380]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:51.660]  You know what?
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.400]  I want that gone.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.060]  How dare you!
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.260]  Don't worry, here comes Geoff.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.040]  What are we...
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.480]  Uh-oh.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.300]  Oh, god!
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:07.700]  Please!
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.720]  Holy shit!
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.780]  The fan's moving!
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:10.520]  Mark!
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.420]  Oh, no!
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.940]  He just drowned himself.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.380]  Geoff!
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:16.680]  Oh!
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.320]  Geoff!
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.520]  Geoff!
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.840]  Geoff, how are you?
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.960]  Alright, there's Nick.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.360]  How come my ghost doesn't...
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.800]  Dude, when you, like, drown in here, your ghost is done.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:28.280]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.100]  Okay.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.360]  You become a soggy ghost.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.480]  I thought the bee platform was a platform and not just...
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:35.700]  Nothing!
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.640]  No, it's just bees.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.340]  Okay.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.760]  I was supposed to say, ghost, you can grab the bees and chase them.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.060]  Oh, my god.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:42.920]  You can bee bait.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.420]  Holy shit.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.000]  Bee bait.
[01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.530]  Oh, god, Nick.
[01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:00.490]  That's interesting.
[01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:01.870]  Yeah.
[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.150]  Yeah.
[01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:03.870]  Do it!
[01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:04.950]  I wanna play the game!
[01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:07.270]  I'm trying to rotate it, you dickhead!
[01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:09.550]  Goddamn!
[01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.610]  Did you enjoy playing the game this round, Eric?
[01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:12.950]  Yep.
[01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.590]  Yeah, let me know how you like it.
[01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:20.670]  Gavin, do you like this round or what?
[01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:21.810]  Do you like playing the game, Gavin?
[01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.730]  Gavin, do you like playing the game?
[01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:23.710]  Yeah, I do like playing the game, Gavin.
[01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:24.150]  Gavin!
[01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:26.090]  Gavin, do you like playing the game?
[01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:27.030]  He's alive!
[01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:29.410]  Gavin!
[01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.990]  Gavin!
[01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.290]  I think I played a little bit longer than you did.
[01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:35.050]  Yeah.
[01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:36.370]  No, I had...
[01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.050]  I think I had more fun that round.
[01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.150]  Winning is the least fun thing you can do in this game.
[01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:43.850]  I agree.
[01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.890]  At this point, we're just trying to figure out how many things we can string together.
[01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:51.230]  Oh.
[01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:57.030]  You guys are insane.
[01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:00.190]  What are we gonna...
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.090]  I can't even.
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:02.350]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:04.690]  Oh, no!
[01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:05.910]  Oh, thank god.
[01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:06.930]  Ow, in the face!
[01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.790]  Yeah, no!
[01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.690]  Goddamn it.
[01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.310]  Oh, I thought you had that, Eric.
[01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:11.410]  I really thought I made it.
[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:12.490]  That was so close.
[01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.130]  It's okay.
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:14.130]  No!
[01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.250]  Damn you to hell, Eric!
[01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:17.490]  Gamekeeper!
[01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:23.630]  Is Geoff alive?
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:24.190]  No!
[01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:27.990]  How many more rounds?
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.730]  Two.
[01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:29.470]  Two, okay.
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:33.410]  Welcome to a whole new game, boys.
[01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.690]  Oh, shit, I missed!
[01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:35.670]  Yeah.
[01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:37.590]  Okay.
[01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:40.510]  Welcome to a whole new game, boys!
[01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:42.150]  Oh, my god.
[01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:43.490]  Oh.
[01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:49.530]  Oh, a rotating punch glove.
[01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:50.510]  Oh, never mind.
[01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.430]  Oh, well.
[01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.690]  Oh, my god.
[01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:57.630]  Oh, my god!
[01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:58.110]  In hell!
[01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:58.870]  Go, go, go!
[01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.610]  Oh, shit!
[01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:01.610]  How did that get me?
[01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.030]  Oh!
[01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.930]  Well, the longer you wait there, the more fucked you are.
[01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.490]  Last round!
[01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:10.470]  This is it.
[01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:11.370]  All the marbles.
[01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:12.290]  Last turn.
[01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.790]  Okay, what do we do?
[01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.470]  What do we do?
[01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.910]  What do we do?
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:15.970]  Oh, okay.
[01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:18.710]  I gotta think ahead.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.140]  Geoff's dog's going nuts.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.080]  That's not my dog.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.040]  No, that's Marshall.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:28.920]  My dog's downstairs.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.440]  That's the people eyes dog.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:32.540]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:33.920]  Let me out.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.980]  That is the eyes of a man.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:35.700]  Let me out.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.600]  Oh, Nick.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:37.480]  You suck!
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.940]  Great jumps.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.280]  Fuck.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.060]  Way to go, Geoff.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:41.920]  Thank you.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.360]  How did that work?
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:44.460]  Beekeeper!
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:44.700]  Coming!
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:45.400]  Coming!
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.460]  Oh, the bees.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:49.800]  Oh, the bees.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.480]  Let me go find more bees.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.360]  Get the fuck out of here.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:53.720]  No!
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.460]  We did it!
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.340]  I think that means Gavin wins, right?
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.480]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.320]  Wow!
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:02.440]  That's the lowest scoring game I think I've ever seen.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.360]  Gavin wins!
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.920]  We turned that map into a piece of shit after three minutes.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:10.820]  Boys!
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.340]  We did it!
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.300]  501 is come and gone.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.180]  Thank you so much for watching.

[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.100]  We do.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.960]  Are We Nostradamus?

[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.360]  And if you watch this on Tuesday, then it's already out.

[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.600]  I was saying everyone's nickname in my head as I said that.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.760]  So, thank you guys for joining us.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:23.780]  We'll see you next time.
