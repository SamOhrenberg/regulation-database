[00:00.000 --> 00:01.520]  I changed my head.
[00:01.540 --> 00:02.380]  Oh, did you?
[00:02.620 --> 00:04.220]  Oh, god damn it.
[00:05.640 --> 00:07.260]  God damn it, Nick.
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.660]  Oh, guys, come on!
[00:10.300 --> 00:11.680]  What the fuck?
[00:12.320 --> 00:14.140]  But this was mine from last time.
[00:14.220 --> 00:15.640]  I already had this head.
[00:15.960 --> 00:18.020]  This is the head that I had.
[00:18.140 --> 00:19.720]  I chose this last time.
[00:20.820 --> 00:21.840]  Oh my god.
[00:21.920 --> 00:23.540]  What the fuck happened to your guy?
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.500]  How do you change so fast?
[00:26.240 --> 00:27.780]  Go to co-workers.
[00:27.780 --> 00:28.240]  Yeah, co-workers.
[00:30.200 --> 00:32.160]  I'm the derpy gator.
[00:32.560 --> 00:33.780]  I like your gator face.
[00:34.200 --> 00:36.140]  I'm a little frosty snowman.
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.660]  I'm the yellow bird.
[00:37.760 --> 00:39.280]  I'm the falcon protecting us
[00:39.280 --> 00:41.300]  in our move to wherever we're going.
[00:42.240 --> 00:44.000]  Oh, wow. Cool fish.
[00:44.480 --> 00:44.900]  Thanks, man.
[00:45.360 --> 00:46.340]  I'm gonna be the catfish.
[00:46.920 --> 00:49.120]  Off we go!
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.940]  Let's go ahead and do...
[00:51.940 --> 00:53.980]  We have 31 of 266 stars,
[00:54.080 --> 00:55.160]  so we're practically done.
[00:55.160 --> 00:57.160]  That doesn't seem right, but...
[00:57.780 --> 00:58.080]  Okay.
[00:59.360 --> 01:00.780]  Do you think we should have more?
[01:00.980 --> 01:01.740]  When do we get to Bowser?
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.540]  I feel like we should have more stars, shouldn't we?
[01:06.760 --> 01:07.760]  Based on what?
[01:07.780 --> 01:08.260]  Our performance?
[01:08.760 --> 01:11.460]  Yeah. I mean...
[01:11.460 --> 01:13.700]  It just feels like one is low.
[01:17.080 --> 01:18.480]  Where do you guys want to go today?
[01:18.820 --> 01:20.400]  We should go to a different place.
[01:20.780 --> 01:23.160]  Because we've been to...
[01:24.660 --> 01:25.460]  Candy Cane?
[01:26.300 --> 01:27.420]  Let's go to Snackmore.
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.400]  This seems like something
[01:29.400 --> 01:31.140]  that Nick is going to love.
[01:31.540 --> 01:32.820]  My teeth already hurt.
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.040]  Snackmore, here we go.
[01:34.920 --> 01:36.600]  Geoff is anti-food.
[01:37.040 --> 01:37.720]  Just like the chocolate.
[01:38.320 --> 01:40.200]  I only eat mashed potatoes now, apparently.
[01:42.740 --> 01:44.300]  Because the dimension is made of candy.
[01:44.460 --> 01:46.000]  I'm not reading any of this. Get real.
[01:46.140 --> 01:48.380]  My dad couldn't make me read, neither can you. Let's go.
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.120]  Can you imagine
[01:51.120 --> 01:52.520]  if you got to live in a place like this?
[01:52.860 --> 01:55.800]  I would just eat myself to death.
[01:58.300 --> 02:00.700]  I'm just looking at the food, man.
[02:00.800 --> 02:02.960]  I don't care, dude. Sticky only sucks
[02:02.960 --> 02:03.980]  if you don't embrace it.
[02:05.160 --> 02:07.220]  I'm with Andrew. I hate being sticky.
[02:07.500 --> 02:08.800]  Me and Michael talk about this all the time.
[02:09.000 --> 02:09.740]  It's the worst.
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.840]  Sticky's not great, but if you're in an environment
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.140]  where sticky is the norm and you give yourself over
[02:15.140 --> 02:15.860]  to it, then it's fine.
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.800]  No, I would still hate it.
[02:17.800 --> 02:18.800]  Give yourself to the stick.
[02:19.780 --> 02:21.160]  Okay, get moving.
[02:21.520 --> 02:22.660]  I was born in the stick.
[02:23.200 --> 02:25.660]  Our pro time is 2 minutes and 40 seconds.
[02:25.740 --> 02:27.540]  Great. Let's remember all the buttons.
[02:27.940 --> 02:28.200]  Easy.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.920]  Right trigger, left trigger.
[02:32.720 --> 02:33.120]  Maybe.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.460]  What do they do?
[02:35.300 --> 02:36.060]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[02:37.260 --> 02:38.680]  Right hand, left hand.
[02:38.960 --> 02:39.440]  A jump.
[02:40.740 --> 02:41.900]  What are we doing?
[02:42.880 --> 02:45.500]  The bird says, do you think we can eat each level when we're done?
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.000]  That's fine.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.660]  Good quip, man.
[02:50.660 --> 02:51.800]  Bust a move.
[02:52.080 --> 02:53.000]  A is jump.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.960]  X is slap.
[02:55.540 --> 02:57.160]  What the hell is this?
[02:57.920 --> 02:59.340]  Do we have to break the candy wall?
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.420]  What are we doing?
[03:01.280 --> 03:01.820]  Ah!
[03:03.140 --> 03:05.460]  It looks like this needs two people.
[03:06.300 --> 03:07.040]  This guy.
[03:07.700 --> 03:08.140]  Oh!
[03:09.220 --> 03:10.700]  Maybe we have to throw it?
[03:11.480 --> 03:11.720]  Oh!
[03:12.680 --> 03:13.140]  Oh!
[03:13.700 --> 03:14.660]  Why would you slap me?
[03:14.860 --> 03:17.660]  Come on, pick it up. Let's fucking throw it.
[03:17.820 --> 03:18.340]  How do we throw?
[03:19.320 --> 03:20.240]  Hold X.
[03:20.980 --> 03:22.020]  And then we let go.
[03:22.700 --> 03:23.120]  There you go.
[03:23.500 --> 03:26.160]  Let me get this out of the way.
[03:27.260 --> 03:28.000]  Excuse me.
[03:29.260 --> 03:29.880]  Pardon me.
[03:30.480 --> 03:31.620]  Good job, guys.
[03:32.540 --> 03:34.500]  You guys got it. You're good.
[03:35.080 --> 03:35.460]  Easy.
[03:37.520 --> 03:38.440]  Hell yeah!
[03:39.100 --> 03:40.300]  Now we're doing it.
[03:40.760 --> 03:42.140]  One more time.
[03:43.260 --> 03:43.820]  Demolition!
[03:44.940 --> 03:45.780]  Oh, man.
[03:46.360 --> 03:46.920]  Cool.
[03:48.240 --> 03:50.480]  We gotta throw it through the chocolate river.
[03:50.720 --> 03:51.760]  I think I gotta grab this long.
[03:52.060 --> 03:53.120]  No, it's not this.
[03:53.320 --> 03:54.460]  Let's go, Professor Snowman.
[03:55.340 --> 03:57.220]  Are we tossing stuff over?
[04:02.100 --> 04:03.220]  Oh, wow!
[04:04.060 --> 04:05.220]  Where's the moving van?
[04:05.220 --> 04:06.300]  Where the fuck are we going?
[04:07.260 --> 04:07.600]  Oh, what?
[04:08.220 --> 04:11.020]  Me and you need to be grabbing stuff from back here
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.880]  and moving it up while they're demolishing everything.
[04:13.020 --> 04:14.000]  I see.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.640]  We can see how we're gonna do here,
[04:17.720 --> 04:20.040]  but I think we're gonna have to start this one over.
[04:20.080 --> 04:20.340]  What do you mean?
[04:20.420 --> 04:22.000]  We got one more minute! Load!
[04:22.360 --> 04:23.240]  Go, go, go!
[04:24.160 --> 04:26.940]  I agree, but...
[04:26.940 --> 04:27.260]  Yeah.
[04:28.180 --> 04:28.640]  Oh, you know what?
[04:29.900 --> 04:32.540]  Oh, shit!
[04:32.540 --> 04:33.160]  Oh, shit!
[04:33.840 --> 04:35.000]  You see what we're supposed to be doing?
[04:35.760 --> 04:37.000]  Here, come here. Somebody help me with this.
[04:37.120 --> 04:38.760]  The conveyor belt!
[04:38.880 --> 04:40.820]  It does the work for us. Come over here.
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.000]  Move smarter, not harder.
[04:43.380 --> 04:43.700]  Move!
[04:45.780 --> 04:46.760]  Somebody grab this end.
[04:47.500 --> 04:47.740]  Go!
[04:49.060 --> 04:50.300]  That's how we're gonna get this done.
[04:52.220 --> 04:53.920]  Come on, you son of a bitch.
[04:54.300 --> 04:54.500]  Uh-oh.
[04:56.160 --> 04:57.840]  Go, go, go!
[04:57.880 --> 04:59.300]  We got time! We can do it!
[04:59.300 --> 05:00.860]  What the...
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.720]  These are like teacups or something?
[05:03.160 --> 05:03.860]  What is happening?
[05:05.180 --> 05:07.100]  They're full of, uh...
[05:07.100 --> 05:08.280]  Strawberry shortcake or some shit.
[05:08.880 --> 05:09.580]  Uh-oh.
[05:10.400 --> 05:11.880]  We gotta break the wall.
[05:12.460 --> 05:13.020]  Oh, no.
[05:14.720 --> 05:15.420]  Guys, we might be out of time.
[05:16.720 --> 05:19.340]  Geoff, you gotta call it out when you need a hand, bud.
[05:19.380 --> 05:20.840]  I did. I said...
[05:22.020 --> 05:23.100]  That's the international
[05:23.100 --> 05:24.340]  I need a hand sound.
[05:25.560 --> 05:26.520]  Keep going.
[05:26.520 --> 05:27.120]  Right in here.
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.400]  There we go.
[05:30.880 --> 05:32.060]  Go, go, go, go.
[05:32.140 --> 05:33.620]  Let's just put it...
[05:35.460 --> 05:36.180]  Pick away!
[05:36.980 --> 05:38.800]  Why? Why do we need to break another wall?
[05:38.940 --> 05:39.860]  We've already got another wall.
[05:39.960 --> 05:41.460]  We have to break these. Look.
[05:42.520 --> 05:44.000]  Oh, we have to for the challenge?
[05:44.440 --> 05:45.460]  Oh, there's stuff in there.
[05:45.660 --> 05:46.280]  I didn't notice.
[05:47.520 --> 05:48.320]  I didn't know.
[05:49.080 --> 05:52.180]  Geoff, help me with this.
[05:52.660 --> 05:53.240]  Yeah, I got you.
[05:55.320 --> 05:56.380]  There we go.
[05:56.500 --> 05:57.900]  To the right.
[05:58.260 --> 05:59.240]  Go, go, go, go.
[06:00.920 --> 06:01.360]  Candyland!
[06:02.380 --> 06:02.820]  What's this?
[06:03.300 --> 06:05.040]  We have to stack everything so high.
[06:05.660 --> 06:06.720]  Oh, crap.
[06:07.180 --> 06:07.880]  What else do we have?
[06:08.860 --> 06:10.380]  I think it's just this last gift.
[06:11.980 --> 06:13.280]  I think that's it.
[06:13.620 --> 06:14.100]  No, this thing.
[06:14.500 --> 06:15.480]  That thing's gotta get in there.
[06:17.960 --> 06:18.780]  Everything's gonna come out.
[06:19.640 --> 06:20.620]  Everything's gonna come out.
[06:20.620 --> 06:21.340]  It's coming out.
[06:21.580 --> 06:23.040]  That's why it all has to go to the top.
[06:24.340 --> 06:25.860]  I don't think that's in.
[06:26.000 --> 06:26.580]  Help me.
[06:28.640 --> 06:28.960]  I got you.
[06:31.340 --> 06:31.860]  That's fine.
[06:32.000 --> 06:32.960]  We're gonna redo this one.
[06:33.060 --> 06:33.960]  We're gonna beat it so fucking fast.
[06:36.100 --> 06:37.520]  Andrew's still got it for some reason.
[06:38.080 --> 06:39.460]  I'm keeping it secure.
[06:39.940 --> 06:40.660]  Great job.
[06:42.500 --> 06:43.360]  We should be done.
[06:44.580 --> 06:45.380]  Oh, Eric!
[06:47.560 --> 06:49.220]  Oh, it's a waffle cone!
[06:49.220 --> 06:50.200]  It's a waffle cone.
[06:53.840 --> 06:54.660]  That's cool.
[06:58.700 --> 06:59.860]  Why isn't it going?
[07:00.120 --> 07:01.100]  Does it have to break?
[07:02.200 --> 07:02.620]  Oh!
[07:05.640 --> 07:07.220]  Maybe it's gotta break.
[07:07.600 --> 07:08.480]  Oh, no.
[07:08.580 --> 07:10.880]  Let's restart. We have to break all those, it turns out.
[07:11.460 --> 07:11.880]  We do?
[07:12.280 --> 07:13.040]  How do you break them?
[07:13.220 --> 07:15.580]  The other ones are still not loaded.
[07:15.980 --> 07:17.060]  This one's not loaded.
[07:17.480 --> 07:19.540]  I don't know. I feel like that should've broke.
[07:20.540 --> 07:21.800]  I think Nick is right.
[07:21.960 --> 07:22.900]  I think we have to break them.
[07:22.980 --> 07:24.480]  We should figure out how to break them and then restart.
[07:24.740 --> 07:27.420]  Yeah, let's go grab it and make sure we know how to break it.
[07:27.460 --> 07:28.420]  Andrew, can you grab it out?
[07:29.420 --> 07:29.780]  Yeah.
[07:30.720 --> 07:32.320]  Oh, do we?
[07:33.780 --> 07:34.400]  I'm trying to.
[07:34.800 --> 07:35.460]  Oh, yeah.
[07:37.940 --> 07:40.860]  Let's restart it and then we'll beat it this time.
[07:41.080 --> 07:41.900]  Alright, we got this.
[07:42.000 --> 07:42.920]  We got this.
[07:42.920 --> 07:44.120]  Break everything.
[07:44.480 --> 07:47.140]  Nick and Andrew, grab the ball and start ramming.
[07:47.220 --> 07:49.860]  Me and Geoff will bring everything that's in the back forward.
[07:50.260 --> 07:50.400]  Yeah.
[07:50.440 --> 07:51.520]  And then we'll just start moving that way.
[07:51.840 --> 07:52.960]  Ram team engaged.
[07:54.040 --> 07:55.420]  Go to the opposite side.
[07:56.580 --> 07:59.800]  Alright, go ahead, Professor.
[08:00.340 --> 08:03.380]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[08:03.380 --> 08:05.320]  Just run, just run, just run.
[08:05.640 --> 08:06.660]  What are you doing? We need it.
[08:06.880 --> 08:08.680]  You have to keep grabbing it and throw it across.
[08:10.760 --> 08:11.620]  It's attached.
[08:12.400 --> 08:12.740]  Oh, okay.
[08:12.840 --> 08:13.660]  There you go.
[08:14.180 --> 08:14.660]  Nice.
[08:15.420 --> 08:17.000]  Let's break these.
[08:17.140 --> 08:19.780]  These don't have anything in them.
[08:19.980 --> 08:20.460]  Okay.
[08:22.460 --> 08:22.940]  Nice.
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.540]  Get that present out of the way.
[08:29.560 --> 08:30.340]  Thank you.
[08:30.740 --> 08:34.480]  Okay, now grab the wrecking ball and just start ramming into everything.
[08:34.600 --> 08:37.640]  Me and Geoff will start moving stuff in.
[08:37.760 --> 08:38.280]  Let's just break everything.
[08:38.800 --> 08:39.740]  Let's break this stuff.
[08:40.460 --> 08:41.180]  Yeah, perfect.
[08:42.460 --> 08:44.060]  Just ram everything.
[08:44.620 --> 08:45.580]  You gotta turn that way.
[08:45.760 --> 08:47.140]  Oh, sorry.
[08:47.820 --> 08:49.820]  Geoff, you can hit Y and look at everything.
[08:51.220 --> 08:52.820]  I think we gotta throw it into those, Andrew.
[08:53.620 --> 08:53.780]  Okay.
[08:53.920 --> 08:54.840]  There we go, that worked.
[08:55.740 --> 08:57.000]  Alright, let's break this one.
[08:58.460 --> 09:00.240]  Gotta break these walls down here, too.
[09:00.540 --> 09:01.380]  Yeah, we're coming.
[09:02.000 --> 09:02.760]  Oh, that didn't work.
[09:02.940 --> 09:03.720]  Geoff, you wanna give me a hand with this?
[09:03.720 --> 09:05.280]  Thank you.
[09:05.800 --> 09:06.680]  You gonna go right?
[09:08.400 --> 09:10.000]  Let's let the conveyor belt do all the work.
[09:10.060 --> 09:10.340]  That's fine.
[09:10.940 --> 09:12.880]  I think you guys can just run into everything, can't you?
[09:13.180 --> 09:14.220]  Yeah, we gotta circle back.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.380]  Let them go.
[09:17.940 --> 09:18.380]  You're good.
[09:19.280 --> 09:20.920]  Oh, we gotta force that one.
[09:20.920 --> 09:22.260]  I guess we gotta throw on those ones.
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.140]  There we go.
[09:25.400 --> 09:25.820]  And one more.
[09:26.640 --> 09:26.960]  There you go.
[09:28.540 --> 09:30.060]  Oh, shit.
[09:31.000 --> 09:31.880]  Watch your stuff.
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.820]  There's one that needs to be broken.
[09:34.380 --> 09:36.040]  Got one right here that needs to be broken.
[09:36.360 --> 09:37.000]  I'm bringing you out.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.100]  There we go.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.740]  Just run this one over right here.
[09:45.100 --> 09:45.740]  There we go.
[09:46.600 --> 09:47.480]  Okay, all good.
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.600]  Oh, we missed some stuff down there.
[09:50.620 --> 09:51.840]  We don't need to break here.
[09:52.200 --> 09:53.480]  Someone give me a hand with this present.
[09:54.840 --> 09:56.000]  Yeah, there you go. Good work.
[09:56.160 --> 09:56.980]  Someone give me a hand with this.
[09:56.980 --> 09:57.460]  On my way.
[09:58.220 --> 09:58.920]  To the right.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.180]  There we go.
[10:03.980 --> 10:05.060]  Nice job, fellas.
[10:05.420 --> 10:06.460]  That should take care of it.
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.800]  Let's see if that stacks up.
[10:08.200 --> 10:10.060]  We don't have to take the wrecking balls with us.
[10:10.080 --> 10:11.340]  I feel like we're done and we're done.
[10:12.020 --> 10:12.560]  Hell yeah.
[10:13.780 --> 10:16.300]  As Crackhead Bob would say, totally Dawesome.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.060]  Totally Dawesome.
[10:18.380 --> 10:19.780]  Totally Dawesome.
[10:22.600 --> 10:24.180]  Dude, that was fucking great.
[10:24.740 --> 10:25.520]  Congratulations, everybody.
[10:26.420 --> 10:27.460]  We are back in it.
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.160]  We are back in it.
[10:30.320 --> 10:30.800]  It was easy.
[10:31.140 --> 10:32.240]  Where do you think we're going now?
[10:33.840 --> 10:34.560]  To the moon.
[10:34.960 --> 10:35.960]  Crackhead Bob's home.
[10:38.240 --> 10:39.600]  You know, he was Elvis' cousin.
[10:41.820 --> 10:43.440]  Did you ever see that bit?
[10:43.540 --> 10:44.120]  They did, Eric.
[10:44.360 --> 10:46.860]  Where they took him to Graceland and said he was Elvis' cousin.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.080]  And then he would sing songs to people.
[10:48.300 --> 10:49.480]  And they would get so mad at him.
[10:51.380 --> 10:52.880]  Alright, let's see where we're going.
[10:54.660 --> 10:55.560]  Come on, man.
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.880]  What's up with the three out of five stars?
[10:59.000 --> 10:59.480]  What did we miss?
[10:59.720 --> 11:00.880]  We probably had some other shit.
[11:01.180 --> 11:03.400]  Bonus objectives and stuff.
[11:04.260 --> 11:04.700]  Gear!
[11:06.100 --> 11:07.140]  Should I go off the...
[11:07.140 --> 11:08.000]  Oh, fuck!
[11:08.140 --> 11:10.760]  Oh, God!
[11:11.920 --> 11:12.800]  Grab that.
[11:14.000 --> 11:14.580]  What is that?
[11:16.000 --> 11:16.660]  It's clothes.
[11:17.600 --> 11:19.460]  It's the reality of what we're dealing with
[11:19.460 --> 11:21.100]  in the state of Texas now, unfortunately.
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.460]  Oh, yeah. Fucked up.
[11:22.840 --> 11:23.820]  It's Ice Cream Guy.
[11:24.100 --> 11:25.260]  Oh, a style crate?
[11:28.620 --> 11:30.520]  Texas has style crates?
[11:31.000 --> 11:32.220]  Get him out of my face.
[11:32.620 --> 11:33.340]  Give me another level.
[11:35.720 --> 11:37.000]  Read these messages.
[11:37.860 --> 11:38.080]  Alright.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.720]  We're going up this way.
[11:41.200 --> 11:43.160]  Oh, right there.
[11:44.800 --> 11:46.060]  I don't like that lemon.
[11:46.060 --> 11:47.760]  Get that lemon out of here.
[11:47.760 --> 11:48.640]  I like it.
[11:48.700 --> 11:49.400]  That's a fruit.
[11:49.660 --> 11:50.680]  That don't belong here.
[11:53.580 --> 11:54.460]  Oh, fuck.
[11:55.060 --> 11:56.160]  Here you go.
[11:57.700 --> 11:58.800]  Good job, buddy.
[11:58.960 --> 11:59.260]  You found it.
[12:01.620 --> 12:02.900]  You found the quest giver.
[12:03.380 --> 12:04.860]  I'm not reading any of this, guys.
[12:05.820 --> 12:06.700]  Four minutes.
[12:06.780 --> 12:07.300]  That's what I'm reading.
[12:08.040 --> 12:09.800]  I'd be so pissed if I bought a house
[12:09.800 --> 12:10.780]  and it was a quest giver.
[12:10.780 --> 12:11.560]  Oh, I know.
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.900]  Do you ever think about when you hire someone,
[12:17.080 --> 12:17.740]  you're the quest giver?
[12:18.200 --> 12:19.240]  Yeah, it's true.
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.780]  You're the NPC.
[12:21.400 --> 12:23.540]  Oh, my God.
[12:24.040 --> 12:26.960]  What are we fucking doing?
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.300]  Demolish the crew.
[12:28.540 --> 12:29.600]  Help me with this, I guess.
[12:30.040 --> 12:30.680]  There you go.
[12:32.660 --> 12:33.420]  Oh, no.
[12:33.940 --> 12:36.440]  He ran into the fucking...
[12:36.440 --> 12:37.380]  We can't go through there.
[12:37.380 --> 12:38.980]  That spoon is deadly.
[12:38.980 --> 12:40.180]  There we go.
[12:41.440 --> 12:43.760]  Sorry, Geoff. I'm trying to move that way.
[12:43.820 --> 12:44.020]  I'm sorry.
[12:44.300 --> 12:46.900]  I thought we had to go up.
[12:47.240 --> 12:48.680]  I didn't realize what they were doing.
[12:50.080 --> 12:50.880]  Oh, break that?
[12:51.040 --> 12:51.420]  Yeah.
[12:53.200 --> 12:54.060]  Oh, fuck.
[12:55.200 --> 12:55.340]  Here.
[12:57.420 --> 12:58.340]  Get the suck.
[12:59.280 --> 12:59.860]  No, I got it.
[13:00.400 --> 13:03.500]  Do you think his face needs to be facing the thing that gets crushed?
[13:04.320 --> 13:04.980]  Facing it?
[13:04.980 --> 13:06.600]  I don't think it matters.
[13:07.460 --> 13:09.340]  We need more stuff.
[13:09.620 --> 13:10.520]  Let's test it out.
[13:11.280 --> 13:11.540]  Sorry.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.420]  You guys are going to have to break a lot of stuff here.
[13:13.840 --> 13:15.280]  Any time.
[13:15.540 --> 13:16.460]  Here we go.
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.880]  Value the lesson learned.
[13:20.000 --> 13:20.240]  I got you.
[13:23.060 --> 13:24.060]  Jump, jump, jump.
[13:24.360 --> 13:26.060]  Trying to make space.
[13:26.460 --> 13:27.360]  Geoff, no!
[13:27.580 --> 13:30.060]  I got knocked off by the wooden spoon.
[13:31.340 --> 13:31.880]  There you go.
[13:33.100 --> 13:33.500]  Nice!
[13:35.000 --> 13:35.760]  Let's start grabbing
[13:35.760 --> 13:37.100]  the little stuff over here.
[13:37.580 --> 13:38.460]  Grab the little things.
[13:40.040 --> 13:41.180]  Grab the little stuff.
[13:42.200 --> 13:43.380]  I'm all over the place, Andrew.
[13:43.420 --> 13:43.860]  What do you want to do?
[13:45.800 --> 13:46.940]  Good communication, guys.
[13:47.040 --> 13:47.720]  Let's throw it through here.
[13:50.340 --> 13:52.080]  What do you want to do?
[13:52.240 --> 13:52.660]  I don't know.
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.280]  If you guys would bust that one out,
[13:55.380 --> 13:56.660]  it would make life so much easier.
[13:58.040 --> 13:59.240]  I got you, Ryan.
[14:00.780 --> 14:01.900]  Let's not wait for them.
[14:02.080 --> 14:02.480]  Yeah.
[14:03.340 --> 14:03.980]  There we go.
[14:04.480 --> 14:05.120]  We're through.
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.700]  There we go.
[14:09.000 --> 14:09.400]  Nice.
[14:11.560 --> 14:12.900]  We got to break this.
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.300]  I think we can just run into it.
[14:18.120 --> 14:19.380]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure you guys
[14:19.380 --> 14:20.540]  can just run into stuff with that.
[14:20.740 --> 14:22.400]  It just needs to be speed.
[14:23.440 --> 14:24.600]  No, not from that angle.
[14:24.600 --> 14:26.140]  I think if his face is red,
[14:26.600 --> 14:27.860]  that means it'll break.
[14:28.040 --> 14:28.420]  Yeah, okay.
[14:29.020 --> 14:30.660]  Ready? Here we go.
[14:31.480 --> 14:31.840]  Nice.
[14:33.600 --> 14:34.660]  Let's get back up here.
[14:36.020 --> 14:37.300]  On that left side,
[14:37.520 --> 14:38.600]  we need you to break stuff down.
[14:38.940 --> 14:39.600]  We're stuck on this.
[14:42.160 --> 14:42.900]  I'm coming, Geoff.
[14:43.500 --> 14:44.500]  I'll jump on the other side.
[14:45.600 --> 14:47.040]  Do you want to just grab this one?
[14:47.180 --> 14:47.640]  It's easier.
[14:48.100 --> 14:50.900]  There we go.
[14:52.940 --> 14:54.060]  I'm going to grab the last
[14:54.060 --> 14:54.800]  small thing in here.
[14:54.860 --> 14:57.120]  Okay, we'll do it.
[15:01.300 --> 15:04.040]  You guys saw some stuff break up in the top right.
[15:04.380 --> 15:05.240]  Yeah, we know.
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.080]  We noticed. We're aware.
[15:08.820 --> 15:10.200]  Oh, that didn't break the way
[15:10.200 --> 15:10.720]  I thought it would.
[15:10.860 --> 15:13.200]  No, not at all, but it's broken.
[15:13.320 --> 15:15.220]  Let's get this other one.
[15:15.680 --> 15:17.140]  We just got to go this one.
[15:17.580 --> 15:18.000]  Okay.
[15:19.820 --> 15:20.720]  Speed is the problem.
[15:20.720 --> 15:21.800]  Good speed.
[15:23.480 --> 15:24.560]  Let's hear it for the boys.
[15:24.720 --> 15:25.340]  I got you, Geoff.
[15:25.900 --> 15:27.000]  Oh, for God's sake.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.020]  You go first.
[15:32.560 --> 15:37.200]  Yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?
[15:37.560 --> 15:38.660]  Get away from that spoon.
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.580]  Let's just go this way.
[15:40.680 --> 15:42.720]  It says full speed, and we don't even need to...
[15:44.620 --> 15:45.940]  This is the last thing in here.
[15:45.980 --> 15:47.240]  We got to go to the top right, fellas.
[15:47.240 --> 15:48.860]  We know, we know, we know.
[15:49.520 --> 15:50.340]  Oh, top left.
[15:50.700 --> 15:51.960]  That's like the last of it, though.
[15:53.700 --> 15:54.420]  Top left.
[15:55.720 --> 15:56.720]  See that thing that Geoff has?
[15:58.940 --> 15:59.700]  Yeah, break it.
[16:00.240 --> 16:00.600]  There we go.
[16:01.420 --> 16:02.400]  Is that it?
[16:02.480 --> 16:03.440]  Go, go, go, go!
[16:04.940 --> 16:06.340]  We got to get this chest up there.
[16:06.680 --> 16:08.380]  Did we do it?
[16:08.720 --> 16:09.040]  Yeah!
[16:11.240 --> 16:13.620]  I mean, they gave us so much time.
[16:13.660 --> 16:14.400]  First try.
[16:14.400 --> 16:15.240]  You know why we got that?
[16:16.040 --> 16:16.940]  Big boys.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.760]  Yeah, we're big boys.
[16:20.020 --> 16:21.220]  Move-ins for the boys.
[16:21.540 --> 16:23.440]  Move-ins for the boys.
[16:23.620 --> 16:26.420]  I'd like to thank the style crate, personally.
[16:27.700 --> 16:28.400]  I gotta say,
[16:28.520 --> 16:31.500]  I like the crinkle cut fries
[16:31.500 --> 16:33.560]  at Raisin Cane's.
[16:33.820 --> 16:34.520]  Yeah, they're good.
[16:35.120 --> 16:35.940]  Yeah, that's a good...
[16:35.940 --> 16:37.180]  That's a solid crinkle cut.
[16:38.460 --> 16:41.740]  Oh, also, they're Texas toast.
[16:45.000 --> 16:45.980]  I mean, yeah.
[16:47.300 --> 16:48.900]  I like the name.
[16:49.620 --> 16:50.580]  That's why I go to
[16:50.580 --> 16:51.600]  Raisin Cane's.
[16:51.620 --> 16:52.360]  Do they have them in Canada?
[16:53.140 --> 16:53.620]  No.
[16:57.840 --> 16:58.320]  Alright,
[16:58.440 --> 16:59.300]  where to now?
[16:59.660 --> 17:02.120]  This feels a lot easier than the sky levels.
[17:02.320 --> 17:03.620]  I feel like we went out of order.
[17:03.640 --> 17:05.380]  But this is the beginning of Candy Level.
[17:05.720 --> 17:06.200]  Exactly.
[17:06.960 --> 17:09.540]  We gotta wait for level 4 of Candy Level
[17:09.540 --> 17:11.420]  before it starts getting fucking stupid.
[17:11.420 --> 17:12.720]  Oh, the Ginger District?
[17:13.040 --> 17:14.820]  That's what I'm talking about.
[17:15.120 --> 17:17.420]  Five minutes.
[17:18.360 --> 17:19.180]  Ginger District.
[17:21.540 --> 17:21.960]  Oh boy.
[17:24.040 --> 17:25.080]  Alright, so...
[17:25.080 --> 17:26.200]  Oh, shit.
[17:27.840 --> 17:29.060]  So we'll need the Wrecking Balls
[17:29.060 --> 17:30.140]  to wreck some balls.
[17:32.180 --> 17:33.000]  What are we trying...
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.820]  Is it all these houses have to break?
[17:35.120 --> 17:35.960]  Geoff, me and you,
[17:36.880 --> 17:38.280]  we'll grab the one in the top.
[17:38.280 --> 17:39.880]  Andrew and Nick, you grab the one on the right.
[17:40.660 --> 17:42.020]  And then we're...
[17:42.020 --> 17:44.160]  Geoff, we're just gonna start running into shit.
[17:44.360 --> 17:45.400]  Like that. Go left.
[17:45.680 --> 17:46.220]  No, no, no.
[17:46.520 --> 17:48.380]  Oh, oh.
[17:50.300 --> 17:51.720]  Somehow on the other side of that.
[17:52.700 --> 17:53.760]  There we go.
[17:54.420 --> 17:55.960]  I think we have to go this way.
[17:56.860 --> 17:57.520]  What are you guys doing?
[17:58.160 --> 17:59.560]  That thing's moving us a bit.
[18:00.140 --> 18:01.860]  Alright, well let's try...
[18:01.860 --> 18:02.320]  Hang on, hang on.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.600]  Holy shit.
[18:05.640 --> 18:07.040]  We gotta throw...
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.300]  There we go, there we go.
[18:09.340 --> 18:10.920]  I think Andy Dalton might live here.
[18:11.200 --> 18:11.840]  Hang on, we gotta hold...
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.560]  Hold X.
[18:14.660 --> 18:16.020]  There we go, there we go.
[18:16.400 --> 18:17.640]  We gotta throw it into that one though.
[18:18.980 --> 18:19.660]  Alright, where are we going?
[18:19.860 --> 18:21.060]  Okay, let me grab the other side.
[18:21.920 --> 18:22.720]  Come on, sir.
[18:23.580 --> 18:24.740]  Why does it keep doing that?
[18:25.500 --> 18:26.760]  No! Yes!
[18:27.100 --> 18:29.240]  Can we break these?
[18:29.880 --> 18:32.840]  We have to break all this stuff.
[18:33.680 --> 18:34.820]  Give me a hand with that.
[18:35.000 --> 18:35.700]  Let's go in here.
[18:37.140 --> 18:38.560]  Can we go over there?
[18:39.200 --> 18:40.820]  Oh, let's just chuck it, maybe.
[18:40.980 --> 18:42.300]  We might not have to break...
[18:42.300 --> 18:43.600]  Geoff, we don't have to break anything in here.
[18:43.700 --> 18:44.940]  We just have to get everything out of there.
[18:46.420 --> 18:48.160]  Let's just grab this and start moving stuff.
[18:49.260 --> 18:50.800]  Start jumping to get through.
[18:51.800 --> 18:53.180]  Oh, what an annoying spot.
[18:54.140 --> 18:55.260]  Alright, we gotta chuck it out.
[18:56.780 --> 18:57.960]  It's to the left now.
[18:58.320 --> 18:58.920]  Hang on, hang on.
[18:58.940 --> 18:59.920]  We got something in here too.
[18:59.920 --> 19:00.300]  Yeah!
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.320]  If we can clear out room by room,
[19:03.440 --> 19:04.580]  I think we'll be effective.
[19:05.600 --> 19:06.320]  Oh, fuck!
[19:07.320 --> 19:09.360]  I don't think we need to break anything else.
[19:09.460 --> 19:10.420]  There we go.
[19:12.680 --> 19:15.140]  Hit Y and see if there's anything in there you need to grab.
[19:16.120 --> 19:16.400]  Whoa!
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.180]  Geoff, do you want to help me in here?
[19:19.260 --> 19:20.960]  There's a present up at the top.
[19:22.420 --> 19:23.920]  I'll grab the other side.
[19:24.080 --> 19:25.080]  This is a bouncy room.
[19:27.260 --> 19:27.680]  Oh, Andrew,
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.320]  I think we need to chuck this out of here.
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.240]  Oh, never mind.
[19:31.320 --> 19:31.840]  Ignore me.
[19:32.100 --> 19:33.280]  We have a lot of weight.
[19:35.760 --> 19:37.120]  I think I can get around it.
[19:37.500 --> 19:37.820]  There we go.
[19:39.500 --> 19:40.140]  We're good.
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.520]  Jump, jump, jump.
[19:43.560 --> 19:44.840]  You might have to throw it, dude.
[19:45.560 --> 19:46.780]  Yeah, you gotta throw it over that.
[19:47.480 --> 19:48.800]  Alright, let me get over to the other side.
[19:50.040 --> 19:50.580]  Try to.
[19:53.040 --> 19:54.140]  I'm trying to drag it back.
[19:54.320 --> 19:54.600]  There you go.
[19:55.180 --> 19:56.520]  Gummy bear couch.
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.140]  Oh.
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.460]  Try one more time.
[19:59.920 --> 20:01.380]  I'm trying to fucking hold it.
[20:01.520 --> 20:02.320]  There we go.
[20:05.420 --> 20:06.020]  Let's go.
[20:06.200 --> 20:07.660]  We gotta go out and around here.
[20:09.240 --> 20:10.580]  We're killing this, Nick.
[20:10.820 --> 20:12.500]  We're doing so good.
[20:12.740 --> 20:14.000]  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
[20:14.240 --> 20:18.200]  We got a team lift.
[20:18.420 --> 20:19.500]  We got two team lifts here.
[20:19.900 --> 20:20.980]  I'll help you chuck this.
[20:20.980 --> 20:21.800]  Thank you.
[20:21.800 --> 20:24.600]  Hang on, Nick.
[20:24.980 --> 20:26.160]  Come to the back.
[20:27.380 --> 20:28.160]  I'm coming.
[20:28.940 --> 20:30.460]  Geoff, I'm coming to you.
[20:31.120 --> 20:32.200]  There we go.
[20:32.760 --> 20:34.580]  All the way.
[20:34.940 --> 20:36.620]  Yeah, baby.
[20:36.840 --> 20:37.260]  Oh, no, no.
[20:38.040 --> 20:38.820]  Oh, you drowned.
[20:39.900 --> 20:40.320]  That's sad.
[20:41.300 --> 20:43.420]  That sounded not that it wasn't sad.
[20:44.040 --> 20:45.580]  Help me at the very top.
[20:47.780 --> 20:48.660]  There you go.
[20:48.660 --> 20:50.160]  Oh, Andrew's got me.
[20:52.720 --> 20:53.320]  There it goes.
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.640]  All the way. That's what I'm talking about.
[20:55.780 --> 20:57.220]  Can somebody help me get this over the hump here?
[20:57.380 --> 20:57.780]  It's a tour.
[20:59.060 --> 21:02.280]  Oh, fuck. It just moved us all.
[21:02.380 --> 21:02.680]  Hang on.
[21:05.240 --> 21:05.600]  There it goes.
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.500]  I'm coming, Andrew.
[21:07.580 --> 21:08.940]  Geoff, can you help Nick in the bottom?
[21:09.920 --> 21:10.980]  Help me, please.
[21:12.140 --> 21:12.560]  Let's go.
[21:13.140 --> 21:14.340]  Throw this shit back.
[21:14.340 --> 21:15.000]  There we go.
[21:15.440 --> 21:16.380]  What is this?
[21:16.820 --> 21:18.680]  Oh, that's the last of it.
[21:19.380 --> 21:20.380]  That's the last thing.
[21:21.680 --> 21:22.880]  There you go.
[21:23.120 --> 21:24.980]  Good, good, good.
[21:25.080 --> 21:26.740]  Throw it up there if you can.
[21:27.340 --> 21:28.740]  You're not going to be able to fit it otherwise.
[21:30.700 --> 21:31.420]  Let's try.
[21:32.380 --> 21:33.040]  Wrong way.
[21:34.400 --> 21:34.680]  Yeah!
[21:35.520 --> 21:36.160]  There we go.
[21:37.260 --> 21:37.740]  Easy.
[21:39.500 --> 21:40.920]  You pair off.
[21:40.920 --> 21:41.980]  Team up.
[21:42.480 --> 21:43.380]  Boom, boom.
[21:43.520 --> 21:44.400]  So who lives here?
[21:44.560 --> 21:47.240]  It's Andy Dalton, Ron Howard.
[21:48.520 --> 21:49.440]  Who else?
[21:50.860 --> 21:52.100]  Price Dallas Howard.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.660]  The whole Howard clan.
[21:55.120 --> 21:56.640]  The whole ginger district.
[21:57.200 --> 21:57.980]  Oh, man.
[21:58.240 --> 22:00.180]  We fucking nailed that, dude.
[22:00.360 --> 22:01.300]  Made it in four seconds.
[22:01.320 --> 22:02.360]  That might be a world record.
[22:03.840 --> 22:07.520]  I feel like we were bad at that and we still beat it with a minute left.
[22:07.520 --> 22:07.740]  No, no.
[22:07.740 --> 22:09.360]  We teamed up.
[22:09.440 --> 22:11.040]  We teamed up really well.
[22:11.300 --> 22:13.400]  And effectively took...
[22:13.400 --> 22:14.780]  Who's this fucking nerd?
[22:15.940 --> 22:16.860]  Stinky Dragon.
[22:17.880 --> 22:19.320]  Great job, team. You found another...
[22:19.320 --> 22:19.560]  No!
[22:20.440 --> 22:23.300]  Maybe the portal can open up a little and we can peek in.
[22:24.460 --> 22:25.360]  Uh, nope.
[22:26.660 --> 22:27.980]  I don't need...
[22:27.980 --> 22:29.720]  Interdimensional nerd talking.
[22:30.320 --> 22:30.860]  I was...
[22:31.340 --> 22:32.980]  We're back over here all of a sudden?
[22:33.420 --> 22:34.740]  Yeah, but go back up to Candy Place.
[22:35.060 --> 22:36.660]  Well, hold on. Let's talk to this nerd.
[22:37.340 --> 22:38.260]  Yeah, let's talk to the nerd.
[22:38.540 --> 22:39.520]  How do we get to the nerd?
[22:39.920 --> 22:40.880]  I don't want to talk to the nerd.
[22:40.980 --> 22:42.660]  There's no talking to the nerd.
[22:44.180 --> 22:45.400]  Let's go back to Candyland.
[22:46.320 --> 22:47.580]  Let's go back to Candyland.
[22:48.780 --> 22:49.420]  Fucking nerd.
[22:50.540 --> 22:52.880]  I was streaming on Twitch last night and some person was like,
[22:52.920 --> 22:54.600]  Hey, I've never... I don't know who you are,
[22:55.040 --> 22:56.180]  but I recognize your voice.
[22:56.260 --> 22:57.240]  Have you been on Stinky Dragon?
[22:58.680 --> 22:59.000]  Wow!
[22:59.740 --> 23:01.040]  It was like, that's what you...
[23:01.040 --> 23:03.340]  That was it? Stinky Dragon?
[23:04.180 --> 23:04.740]  That's awesome.
[23:05.040 --> 23:06.100]  That's cool, man. Crazy.
[23:06.960 --> 23:09.980]  Alright, we've done Gingerbread Testing Facility.
[23:10.100 --> 23:11.160]  How do we get up there?
[23:11.640 --> 23:13.220]  Oh, oh, oh, go up on the honeycomb.
[23:15.060 --> 23:15.300]  No?
[23:15.620 --> 23:16.360]  Uh, no.
[23:16.700 --> 23:17.360]  Oh, there it goes.
[23:18.660 --> 23:19.160]  Wow!
[23:20.260 --> 23:21.540]  This is dumb. This sucks.
[23:21.600 --> 23:22.240]  Hell yeah.
[23:23.260 --> 23:26.040]  Look, guys! A basketball game!
[23:26.960 --> 23:28.740]  Dude, I love...
[23:28.740 --> 23:30.720]  Ice cream sandwich.
[23:31.040 --> 23:32.680]  Alright, pass scores 2,
[23:32.760 --> 23:33.480]  pro scores 8.
[23:34.620 --> 23:36.200]  We're aces at this.
[23:36.780 --> 23:38.880]  I'm gonna be... Geoff, you can be
[23:39.660 --> 23:40.780]  Luka Dongchich
[23:40.780 --> 23:42.380]  and I'm gonna be Zach Collins.
[23:42.640 --> 23:44.320]  Backup center for the
[23:45.240 --> 23:46.340]  San Antonio Spurs.
[23:46.720 --> 23:48.620]  I'm Ray Allen in 2009.
[23:48.920 --> 23:51.160]  No, 2008. I'm 2008 Ray Allen.
[23:51.580 --> 23:52.640]  I'm Anuja Nobly!
[23:53.280 --> 23:54.000]  Oh, no.
[23:54.160 --> 23:55.820]  Get the highest score before the time runs out.
[23:55.820 --> 23:56.140]  Alright.
[23:56.880 --> 23:59.300]  Oh, no. It's duos.
[23:59.620 --> 24:00.280]  Alright, Geoff.
[24:01.140 --> 24:02.180]  Me and you.
[24:02.660 --> 24:03.760]  Go to the left.
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.480]  Grab a ball!
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.280]  Andrew, this way.
[24:08.600 --> 24:09.200]  Ready?
[24:11.600 --> 24:12.940]  Wait, wait, wait.
[24:13.400 --> 24:14.540]  We load it.
[24:14.800 --> 24:15.920]  We load it.
[24:16.880 --> 24:17.240]  Oh!
[24:19.540 --> 24:20.280]  What are you doing?
[24:20.640 --> 24:21.520]  What's happening?
[24:22.480 --> 24:22.880]  Oh!
[24:23.180 --> 24:24.560]  You put it to the front.
[24:26.100 --> 24:28.660]  Geoff, that's you.
[24:29.980 --> 24:31.120]  Hang on, we gotta pull it back.
[24:32.580 --> 24:32.940]  Ready?
[24:33.180 --> 24:34.560]  Wait, wait, wait.
[24:35.660 --> 24:36.460]  Hang on.
[24:37.100 --> 24:37.680]  Right there.
[24:39.080 --> 24:39.700]  Come on!
[24:41.260 --> 24:43.260]  So you gotta pull it really far.
[24:43.400 --> 24:45.520]  Here, Geoff, you wanna keep shooting and I'll keep
[24:45.520 --> 24:46.000]  loading it up?
[24:47.680 --> 24:49.460]  You gotta pull it back further, I think.
[24:49.460 --> 24:50.780]  How do I pull it back?
[24:51.060 --> 24:52.620]  Oh, hang on. It's two people.
[24:53.420 --> 24:54.200]  That's my bad.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.460]  There we go.
[24:58.000 --> 24:59.400]  But the ball isn't loaded up.
[24:59.820 --> 25:01.160]  How do you guys load up the ball?
[25:01.640 --> 25:02.540]  You put it on the front.
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.420]  How did you do that?
[25:05.600 --> 25:05.660]  Oh!
[25:06.820 --> 25:07.700]  Geoff, come.
[25:09.560 --> 25:10.000]  Teamwork!
[25:10.360 --> 25:12.580]  Hang on. There it is.
[25:13.340 --> 25:13.960]  That's in.
[25:15.120 --> 25:15.560]  No!
[25:15.560 --> 25:15.880]  No!
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.500]  We're redoing this
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.380]  so fucking hard, and also
[25:21.380 --> 25:23.620]  I want to only play this from now on.
[25:23.700 --> 25:24.860]  Yeah, fuck the rest of the game.
[25:25.420 --> 25:27.180]  Hey, you guys wanna switch to golf?
[25:29.120 --> 25:30.760]  Hang on, hang on. We gotta go left.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.160]  That's in.
[25:33.380 --> 25:34.200]  Backboard shot!
[25:35.620 --> 25:36.360]  Boom, baby.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.320]  Geoff, we're loaded up. Let's go.
[25:39.420 --> 25:40.040]  Alright, let's go.
[25:41.580 --> 25:41.980]  Go!
[25:41.980 --> 25:42.580]  Go!
[25:44.020 --> 25:44.740]  Bank shot!
[25:45.680 --> 25:48.040]  Guys, me and Geoff made it.
[25:48.120 --> 25:49.900]  How come you didn't make it?
[25:50.160 --> 25:51.080]  Me and Geoff made it.
[25:51.220 --> 25:52.220]  Alright, here we go.
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.400]  We gotta go back this way.
[25:55.560 --> 25:56.440]  We got this.
[25:58.140 --> 25:58.860]  Come on!
[25:59.860 --> 26:00.360]  I'll load it up.
[26:00.680 --> 26:02.520]  And fire!
[26:04.500 --> 26:04.860]  No!
[26:06.500 --> 26:07.660]  We gotta redo this.
[26:07.900 --> 26:08.520]  Alright, one more.
[26:08.520 --> 26:09.120]  We gotta redo this.
[26:09.780 --> 26:10.940]  Well, now we know what to do.
[26:11.420 --> 26:13.720]  My ball wasn't loading up every time I put it there.
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.600]  I know, it's crazy.
[26:15.120 --> 26:16.460]  It had to, like, grip.
[26:16.840 --> 26:19.360]  Hey, did you guys get your free taquito coupon?
[26:20.240 --> 26:20.600]  No.
[26:21.020 --> 26:21.800]  What the hell?
[26:22.320 --> 26:23.520]  No, they handed them out.
[26:23.580 --> 26:25.060]  We walked right by the person who handed them out.
[26:28.920 --> 26:30.240]  Let's do restart job.
[26:30.420 --> 26:30.820]  What did we get?
[26:33.580 --> 26:33.940]  100%.
[26:33.940 --> 26:35.360]  That guy was incredible, though.
[26:37.700 --> 26:38.780]  At the basketball game.
[26:38.980 --> 26:40.300]  Alright, Geoff, I'm gonna load up.
[26:40.500 --> 26:41.780]  And you start...
[26:41.780 --> 26:42.320]  I'll start pulling.
[26:43.260 --> 26:45.580]  I'm gonna go to the left, and you're gonna get it going.
[26:45.960 --> 26:47.240]  I'm gonna immediately load, Nick.
[26:47.400 --> 26:48.320]  Okay, I'll be waiting.
[26:49.520 --> 26:50.100]  Come on.
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.820]  God, there's so many A's I have to hit.
[26:51.980 --> 26:52.300]  I know.
[26:53.900 --> 26:54.620]  Hang on.
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.300]  Okay, load it up.
[26:59.920 --> 27:01.000]  Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[27:02.080 --> 27:02.460]  There it is.
[27:02.460 --> 27:03.500]  There we go.
[27:04.200 --> 27:05.900]  Come on, get in there.
[27:06.600 --> 27:07.460]  No way!
[27:07.740 --> 27:08.140]  Shit!
[27:10.100 --> 27:10.680]  Yeah!
[27:12.100 --> 27:12.680]  Perfectly!
[27:13.500 --> 27:14.820]  That's good, that's good.
[27:16.460 --> 27:17.400]  There we go.
[27:18.680 --> 27:19.100]  Quick, Andrew.
[27:20.060 --> 27:21.700]  Fuck, fuck, it's not...
[27:23.000 --> 27:23.900]  That's gonna work.
[27:24.400 --> 27:25.460]  Oh, it's too left.
[27:26.100 --> 27:26.600]  Too left.
[27:27.820 --> 27:28.400]  Middle.
[27:28.400 --> 27:29.400]  Wait, wait, wait.
[27:29.440 --> 27:30.600]  There we go.
[27:31.940 --> 27:32.160]  Perfect.
[27:34.180 --> 27:35.220]  Okay, there we go.
[27:35.960 --> 27:36.520]  Oh, no!
[27:36.860 --> 27:37.660]  Oh, no!
[27:39.360 --> 27:41.260]  That was money, too.
[27:42.360 --> 27:43.580]  Oh, god damn it.
[27:43.900 --> 27:46.080]  I hope the NBA never does this.
[27:46.860 --> 27:48.420]  Oh, it moves so fast!
[27:49.060 --> 27:50.040]  That's such bullshit.
[27:50.560 --> 27:51.400]  Oh, get in!
[27:51.820 --> 27:52.380]  No!
[27:53.460 --> 27:56.880]  Okay, all the way right.
[27:56.880 --> 27:58.180]  Sorry, sorry.
[27:58.900 --> 27:59.960]  No, Geoff, too soon!
[28:00.580 --> 28:01.600]  My bad, my bad.
[28:01.920 --> 28:03.500]  You have to wait for the X to get up there.
[28:04.000 --> 28:04.460]  Okay, hold on.
[28:05.600 --> 28:06.620]  Here we go, pull back.
[28:08.720 --> 28:08.960]  Right there.
[28:10.360 --> 28:10.820]  That's in.
[28:12.680 --> 28:15.240]  That's five, that's better than last time.
[28:17.560 --> 28:18.240]  Come on!
[28:18.840 --> 28:20.640]  I think we gotta speed it up a little bit, Andrew.
[28:21.140 --> 28:22.440]  There we go, that's it, it's gonna work.
[28:22.660 --> 28:23.060]  Oh, no.
[28:23.060 --> 28:23.440]  No!
[28:25.060 --> 28:25.460]  Sorry.
[28:26.080 --> 28:26.860]  We're gonna have to do this again.
[28:28.940 --> 28:30.160]  We still got time.
[28:30.720 --> 28:32.620]  It's moving, it's moving, it's moving.
[28:33.040 --> 28:33.440]  Fire!
[28:34.540 --> 28:35.940]  No, it's not far enough.
[28:36.840 --> 28:37.240]  No!
[28:38.220 --> 28:38.620]  No!
[28:40.460 --> 28:41.900]  Okay, yeah, we're gonna have to do this again.
[28:43.260 --> 28:44.340]  Oh, no, come on!
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.900]  There we go, that's good.
[28:47.260 --> 28:48.740]  We're gonna get...
[28:48.740 --> 28:50.060]  Oh, hell yeah!
[28:50.060 --> 28:51.440]  How did we not make it?
[28:51.900 --> 28:53.120]  If we both hit it in.
[28:54.860 --> 28:56.500]  How many was that for us, Nick?
[28:56.620 --> 28:56.980]  Five?
[28:57.160 --> 28:59.180]  I think it's five or six.
[29:00.060 --> 29:02.220]  No, we got six, but I'm saying Nick and I
[29:02.220 --> 29:03.020]  think we got five.
[29:04.520 --> 29:06.860]  I'll have to watch a replay of that.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.180]  I don't think so.
[29:08.480 --> 29:10.300]  Good news, we have four angles on that
[29:10.300 --> 29:10.840]  son of a bitch.
[29:11.560 --> 29:13.320]  We don't even have the people to edit.
[29:13.740 --> 29:14.660]  You want a replay?
[29:16.720 --> 29:18.020]  Oops, I hit the wrong button.
[29:18.020 --> 29:18.740]  Oh, cool!
[29:19.020 --> 29:20.680]  We can drive around again.
[29:21.440 --> 29:22.200]  One more time.
[29:23.020 --> 29:24.900]  This is what the all-star game should be.
[29:26.020 --> 29:27.680]  Can you imagine if Adam Silver
[29:27.680 --> 29:28.980]  was like, listen, I had a dream.
[29:29.240 --> 29:30.580]  Okay, I got a new idea.
[29:31.180 --> 29:33.700]  Candy balls, we're doing a chocolate river.
[29:34.160 --> 29:36.200]  Getting launched from a giant slingshot.
[29:36.820 --> 29:38.040]  Made of licorice.
[29:39.340 --> 29:40.300]  Honeycomb back...
[29:40.300 --> 29:40.620]  board.
[29:41.540 --> 29:42.500]  Alright, focus.
[29:43.300 --> 29:45.660]  Everyone has been asking about the four-point shot.
[29:45.660 --> 29:47.900]  I'm here to introduce the honeycomb backboard.
[29:51.580 --> 29:52.880]  Alright, Geoff, me and you again.
[29:53.820 --> 29:54.700]  Moving left.
[29:55.620 --> 29:55.900]  Alright.
[29:56.640 --> 29:57.820]  Here we go.
[29:59.560 --> 30:00.100]  Hang on.
[30:01.100 --> 30:02.140]  God damn it.
[30:03.540 --> 30:04.060]  Geoff!
[30:06.060 --> 30:07.700]  We helped him get in though.
[30:08.640 --> 30:09.760]  No, we didn't.
[30:09.840 --> 30:10.220]  Yeah, we did.
[30:10.500 --> 30:13.820]  We got the assist on that.
[30:13.820 --> 30:15.380]  There it is.
[30:15.760 --> 30:16.600]  Move, move, move.
[30:16.880 --> 30:17.400]  That's us.
[30:18.580 --> 30:19.340]  Oh, come on.
[30:19.840 --> 30:20.240]  Ah!
[30:22.820 --> 30:23.660]  Oh, what the hell?
[30:24.760 --> 30:26.940]  I got thrown across the level.
[30:27.300 --> 30:28.140]  Geoff, left her.
[30:29.980 --> 30:31.260]  Far back as we go.
[30:33.640 --> 30:34.440]  It's not gonna be in.
[30:34.900 --> 30:35.420]  It's not gonna be in.
[30:36.760 --> 30:37.360]  Thanks, man.
[30:38.760 --> 30:39.020]  Hang on.
[30:39.020 --> 30:39.760]  Oh.
[30:41.340 --> 30:42.440]  What the fuck?
[30:43.400 --> 30:44.460]  Where did you go?
[30:44.820 --> 30:45.760]  I don't know.
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.040]  What are you two doing?
[30:48.600 --> 30:51.620]  I keep getting launched across the level.
[30:51.720 --> 30:53.120]  Looks like we're scrolling again.
[30:53.360 --> 30:55.640]  We're also making baskets, so I don't know what you're doing.
[30:55.980 --> 30:58.100]  We pulled that to the right a little too much, I think.
[30:58.320 --> 30:58.920]  Fuck, yeah.
[30:59.060 --> 30:59.500]  I got this one.
[31:00.020 --> 31:01.080]  Don't worry, we scored.
[31:01.440 --> 31:02.940]  We got it. It's fine, guys.
[31:03.160 --> 31:07.020]  As soon as we let go, we should be...
[31:07.020 --> 31:09.040]  going for our own rebound, you know what I'm saying?
[31:09.400 --> 31:10.340]  Come on!
[31:10.860 --> 31:11.700]  Oh, shit.
[31:13.480 --> 31:13.600]  No!
[31:15.420 --> 31:16.020]  There we go.
[31:16.700 --> 31:18.300]  Oh, you see that switch?
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.220]  You see that switch?
[31:20.600 --> 31:22.380]  You see that switch over here?
[31:25.320 --> 31:25.880]  Alright.
[31:26.160 --> 31:27.220]  We just need one.
[31:27.900 --> 31:29.020]  Oh, drop.
[31:29.840 --> 31:32.540]  Go. Yeah, that's it.
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.120]  No.
[31:34.120 --> 31:34.320]  No.
[31:37.780 --> 31:38.600]  All the way left.
[31:38.960 --> 31:40.060]  All the way, all the way, all the way.
[31:40.360 --> 31:41.420]  Further. Pull back.
[31:41.980 --> 31:43.740]  I'm back as far as I can go, man.
[31:44.020 --> 31:44.840]  Oh, my God.
[31:46.640 --> 31:48.100]  What are you two doing?
[31:48.220 --> 31:49.040]  Fire at it!
[31:49.360 --> 31:50.320]  It wouldn't let us go.
[31:51.280 --> 31:52.100]  Get in there.
[31:53.380 --> 31:54.180]  Don't worry.
[31:55.280 --> 31:56.120]  We got you.
[31:58.320 --> 31:59.640]  I'm pretty sure...
[32:00.080 --> 32:02.060]  I think me and Geoff got six.
[32:02.060 --> 32:04.520]  So, I appreciate your help with the two.
[32:04.620 --> 32:05.740]  Of the eight, yeah.
[32:06.060 --> 32:08.280]  I believe you were counting the amount of times
[32:08.280 --> 32:10.480]  you fucking died by launching off the level.
[32:11.080 --> 32:12.040]  Not baskets.
[32:12.420 --> 32:13.560]  I don't know how that happened.
[32:13.880 --> 32:16.380]  I just... I just kept getting
[32:16.380 --> 32:18.480]  tossed, like, across
[32:18.480 --> 32:19.760]  so far.
[32:20.200 --> 32:21.620]  Never happened any other time.
[32:21.720 --> 32:24.100]  Just in that run. A bunch.
[32:24.460 --> 32:26.100]  Why did it keep happening so many times?
[32:26.400 --> 32:27.620]  It was fucking weird.
[32:28.300 --> 32:29.740]  I don't know what I was doing to cause it.
[32:29.740 --> 32:30.900]  I was just getting launched.
[32:31.020 --> 32:32.880]  Alright, do you think this will be last map?
[32:33.140 --> 32:34.160]  Yeah, let's do last map.
[32:34.440 --> 32:35.700]  I feel good about this one.
[32:37.040 --> 32:39.380]  Looks like it's another parlor game of some kind.
[32:39.920 --> 32:40.720]  Lollipop Gallery.
[32:41.820 --> 32:42.700]  Lollipop Gallery!
[32:43.340 --> 32:43.780]  24.
[32:45.160 --> 32:46.160]  Oh, goodness.
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.220]  What do we have to do?
[32:49.700 --> 32:51.240]  Your score is all that matters.
[32:51.740 --> 32:53.740]  Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows, Eric.
[32:55.460 --> 32:57.200]  Oh, shit, it's a duos game again.
[32:57.200 --> 32:59.020]  Oh, man. Alright, Andrew.
[32:59.340 --> 33:00.180]  We're the team to beat.
[33:00.360 --> 33:02.900]  Alright, I got it.
[33:02.980 --> 33:04.000]  You and I both love loading.
[33:06.020 --> 33:06.100]  Oh!
[33:07.420 --> 33:07.900]  Yeah!
[33:08.640 --> 33:10.440]  There it is.
[33:11.140 --> 33:11.380]  Oh!
[33:13.240 --> 33:13.900]  Let's see.
[33:14.320 --> 33:15.480]  You say dropping loads?
[33:17.080 --> 33:18.560]  Definitely dropping loads.
[33:20.080 --> 33:21.040]  Alright, let's...
[33:21.040 --> 33:21.980]  We're gonna go all the way far.
[33:22.500 --> 33:23.760]  Hang on, they're going for it.
[33:24.160 --> 33:24.480]  Yeah!
[33:25.160 --> 33:27.120]  We got it, you little son of a gun!
[33:28.140 --> 33:28.760]  Yee-haw!
[33:29.160 --> 33:31.700]  You guys get the one in the top right, we'll get the smaller ones at the bottom.
[33:31.820 --> 33:32.500]  Geoff, you got it.
[33:33.180 --> 33:35.080]  Oh, my God, how did we miss that?
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.060]  That wasn't we, that was you.
[33:37.980 --> 33:38.760]  Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
[33:39.900 --> 33:40.640]  It's not in there.
[33:41.460 --> 33:43.920]  I think we could probably...
[33:43.920 --> 33:45.100]  It's not... Why won't it...
[33:45.100 --> 33:46.400]  There we go.
[33:47.280 --> 33:48.320]  Oh, fuck you!
[33:50.400 --> 33:50.720]  Now...
[33:50.720 --> 33:51.300]  There it is.
[33:52.640 --> 33:53.500]  Alright, good to know.
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.620]  I know exactly how much to lead it now.
[33:55.960 --> 33:56.420]  Alright, here we go.
[33:58.160 --> 33:59.860]  You get the one down here.
[34:00.520 --> 34:02.160]  Alright, I got this one.
[34:02.260 --> 34:02.640]  There you go.
[34:04.220 --> 34:05.780]  You guys get the one in the top if you can.
[34:06.940 --> 34:09.000]  We will as soon as we...
[34:09.000 --> 34:09.460]  Never mind.
[34:10.600 --> 34:11.360]  You're good.
[34:12.260 --> 34:12.600]  Fire!
[34:13.620 --> 34:14.960]  Geoff got the star!
[34:15.380 --> 34:16.100]  Hell yeah!
[34:16.100 --> 34:16.420]  Star!
[34:19.140 --> 34:19.660]  Oh, no.
[34:21.400 --> 34:22.540]  What a shot!
[34:24.220 --> 34:25.240]  Me and you, Geoff.
[34:25.380 --> 34:25.880]  All the way up there.
[34:27.200 --> 34:27.420]  Boom!
[34:28.480 --> 34:29.220]  Fuck you!
[34:30.960 --> 34:33.460]  Low is one person, high is two people.
[34:34.760 --> 34:35.000]  Nice.
[34:35.100 --> 34:37.860]  If you guys can focus on high and we can go for low,
[34:37.980 --> 34:38.900]  I feel good about this.
[34:39.200 --> 34:40.900]  Yeah, when you go high, we go low.
[34:41.180 --> 34:42.280]  Damn, I was about to say that.
[34:42.280 --> 34:43.360]  Except the other.
[34:44.700 --> 34:45.140]  Go for it, Geoff.
[34:46.780 --> 34:47.260]  Fire!
[34:48.300 --> 34:49.180]  Oh, I think I got it.
[34:49.940 --> 34:50.420]  Nice.
[34:52.260 --> 34:53.820]  Hit the star if you can.
[34:54.160 --> 34:54.980]  He's too high.
[34:55.720 --> 34:57.720]  No, too fast.
[34:58.600 --> 34:59.420]  Nice shot!
[35:00.260 --> 35:00.920]  Good lead.
[35:01.120 --> 35:02.880]  Sorry, I got greedy, Andrew.
[35:03.320 --> 35:03.800]  That's my fault.
[35:06.040 --> 35:07.180]  Let's go to the top, Geoff.
[35:07.900 --> 35:09.260]  We just need one more.
[35:09.260 --> 35:10.700]  Kill this bat.
[35:10.860 --> 35:12.840]  God damn it.
[35:14.340 --> 35:15.520]  Oh, damn it!
[35:15.940 --> 35:16.340]  Geoff, you got it.
[35:16.560 --> 35:18.060]  Boom, baby.
[35:18.940 --> 35:20.740]  Geoff's the fucking star here, baby.
[35:20.900 --> 35:21.540]  Me and you, Geoff.
[35:21.780 --> 35:24.680]  Got it. Fast. Nailed it.
[35:25.280 --> 35:25.820]  Easy.
[35:28.060 --> 35:29.040]  We let go?
[35:29.720 --> 35:30.080]  Damn it.
[35:31.260 --> 35:33.060]  Dude, I gotta say,
[35:33.200 --> 35:36.000]  Geoff, you need to watch that back.
[35:36.300 --> 35:37.450]  You were fucking locked
[35:38.330 --> 35:38.890]  in.
[35:39.450 --> 35:40.850]  Thank you very much.
[35:41.190 --> 35:41.230]  That was wild.
[35:42.650 --> 35:45.350]  Whatever this type of game is,
[35:45.950 --> 35:47.450]  that's your fucking lane.
[35:47.770 --> 35:48.650]  That was crazy.
[35:48.950 --> 35:51.550]  I felt like I was in Full Metal Jacket
[35:51.550 --> 35:52.390]  when they're in the helicopter
[35:52.390 --> 35:54.370]  and the Joker's like,
[35:54.470 --> 35:56.350]  how can you kill women and children?
[35:56.950 --> 35:58.370]  And the dude's like, it's easy,
[35:58.430 --> 36:00.030]  you just don't lead them as much.
[36:00.170 --> 36:01.910]  I just needed to figure out how much
[36:01.910 --> 36:03.190]  to lead the lollipops.
[36:03.950 --> 36:05.910]  You led them just enough, bud.
[36:06.110 --> 36:06.330]  Way to go.
[36:06.330 --> 36:08.150]  When are we taking you to a carnival, Geoff?
[36:08.570 --> 36:10.530]  We got some prizes to win.
[36:11.450 --> 36:13.130]  I've always been a crack shot.
[36:13.310 --> 36:13.730]  Let's go!
[36:15.710 --> 36:17.450]  We're gonna go to a carnival
[36:17.450 --> 36:18.490]  and get those prizes.
[36:18.990 --> 36:21.170]  Guys, thank you so much for watching this.
[36:21.270 --> 36:22.850]  If you want to follow us,
[36:23.970 --> 36:25.950]  depends on when this comes out.
[36:29.650 --> 36:30.550]  What do we say?
[36:30.550 --> 36:31.750]  I don't know why you said that.
[36:31.890 --> 36:34.450]  Thanks for listening to another
[36:34.450 --> 36:36.010]  Regulation Gameplay.
[36:36.110 --> 36:38.190]  We hope you enjoyed it.
[36:38.970 --> 36:40.490]  Keep on the lookout for more
[36:40.490 --> 36:42.670]  Regulation Gameplays. They may appear
[36:42.670 --> 36:44.390]  in different spots, who knows,
[36:44.590 --> 36:45.690]  but they will appear.
[36:46.150 --> 36:48.490]  We love ya. See ya next time.
