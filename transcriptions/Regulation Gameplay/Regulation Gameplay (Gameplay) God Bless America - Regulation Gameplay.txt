[00:00.000 --> 00:04.220]  Guys, welcome to our, uh, what's the name of this game?
[00:04.340 --> 00:06.800]  Ultimate Chicken Horse, uh, gameplay.
[00:07.220 --> 00:08.960]  We're going after the French.
[00:09.220 --> 00:10.980]  Geoff is an albino squeal-eel.
[00:11.340 --> 00:14.140]  Uh, Nick is the monkey. Andrew is the elephant.
[00:14.440 --> 00:15.940]  And Gavin is the parrot.
[00:16.180 --> 00:18.260]  And guys, look at all these levels we have to choose from.
[00:19.100 --> 00:20.620]  I'm the purple burger alarm.
[00:21.060 --> 00:23.700]  Last time I played this game, there were three levels.
[00:25.480 --> 00:26.440]  Jesus Christ.
[00:26.560 --> 00:28.620]  Last time you played this game, rooster teeth was a thing.
[00:30.260 --> 00:34.620]  Last time I played this game, rooster teeth was not only a thing, it was still thriving.
[00:34.880 --> 00:38.380]  I mean, last time you played this, it probably started with a guy going,
[00:38.580 --> 00:39.580]  Let's play!
[00:39.840 --> 00:42.080]  And then it, like, and then everyone started going.
[00:42.440 --> 00:42.740]  You know what I mean?
[00:42.740 --> 00:44.720]  This might be a post-Ray game.
[00:45.220 --> 00:45.820]  Wow, really?
[00:45.820 --> 00:46.720]  Yeah, this is post-Ray.
[00:47.160 --> 00:47.600]  Wow.
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.500]  Jeremy was the post-Ray!
[00:51.780 --> 00:53.600]  Michael, oh, Michael loved this game.
[00:53.900 --> 00:54.880]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:55.960 --> 00:56.700]  Same about Michael.
[00:59.080 --> 01:00.260]  Alright, Andrew didn't vote.
[01:00.400 --> 01:01.700]  I already lost this job.
[01:02.300 --> 01:04.600]  You pick from the box, you place the thing,
[01:04.700 --> 01:05.620]  and then you have to beat the levels.
[01:05.960 --> 01:08.500]  I don't know what that one does.
[01:09.120 --> 01:10.960]  That's a jump thing.
[01:11.720 --> 01:12.200]  There you go.
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.580]  What does this do?
[01:13.960 --> 01:15.700]  How do you rotate, Gavin? Do you remember?
[01:16.320 --> 01:17.020]  The bumpers.
[01:18.920 --> 01:20.240]  What do you think this does?
[01:20.240 --> 01:22.420]  I think you gotta go left, right somewhere.
[01:22.680 --> 01:24.340]  Oh, you could go way up and down.
[01:24.420 --> 01:25.160]  That's a lot of fun.
[01:26.580 --> 01:27.320]  You know what?
[01:27.660 --> 01:28.660]  Just consider that...
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.780]  Let's make it worth the risk.
[01:30.500 --> 01:33.540]  That's the start, we'll see how it goes.
[01:34.480 --> 01:36.120]  First round's usually very doable.
[01:36.600 --> 01:36.640]  Yeah.
[01:36.940 --> 01:37.720]  Come on, albinos!
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.940]  Alright, here we go.
[01:41.640 --> 01:42.520]  No, he took it!
[01:44.220 --> 01:45.580]  Oh my god, he's gone.
[01:47.100 --> 01:47.640]  Okay, he won.
[01:47.860 --> 01:47.980]  Wow.
[01:49.540 --> 01:51.920]  I was about to say, it's not a race, but I think it is, actually.
[01:52.280 --> 01:52.900]  Yeah, it's a race.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.800]  Oh, it's a race? Oh, no!
[01:55.860 --> 01:57.440]  But if everyone completes the level,
[01:57.620 --> 01:58.860]  it's declared as too easy.
[01:59.080 --> 01:59.620]  Oh, nevermind.
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.000]  Oh my god!
[02:03.940 --> 02:05.440]  He made me panic!
[02:05.740 --> 02:06.480]  He made me panic!
[02:06.840 --> 02:08.920]  We don't have to worry about that here.
[02:09.240 --> 02:11.220]  The only two people that have played it
[02:11.220 --> 02:12.600]  are the only ones who've played the first level.
[02:12.680 --> 02:15.380]  Andrew, you've been set
[02:15.380 --> 02:17.460]  as a 90% handicap
[02:17.460 --> 02:18.220]  for some reason.
[02:18.440 --> 02:19.480]  What does that mean?
[02:19.480 --> 02:21.740]  You get 90%
[02:21.740 --> 02:23.080]  of the points that we do.
[02:23.580 --> 02:25.240]  Oh, great. Wait, what?
[02:26.200 --> 02:27.740]  I don't know, you can pick that in the menu.
[02:27.960 --> 02:29.380]  You cheatin' son of a bitch!
[02:29.580 --> 02:30.260]  I called it!
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.820]  You did! You're the host!
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.040]  I didn't set that. I think you have to set that, don't you?
[02:36.620 --> 02:38.080]  Why would I set that?
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.380]  I thought it was a host thing.
[02:40.740 --> 02:40.940]  Hmm.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.660]  Well, it's
[02:43.660 --> 02:44.400]  being recorded.
[02:45.440 --> 02:46.140]  Oh, shit.
[02:46.140 --> 02:47.700]  Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick!
[02:49.040 --> 02:50.120]  Oh, it killed him!
[02:50.760 --> 02:52.600]  It pushed him into the glass!
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.220]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[02:58.680 --> 02:59.420]  Oh, no!
[02:59.620 --> 03:00.700]  Go, monkey, go!
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.540]  100% eat, baby!
[03:04.420 --> 03:06.240]  That's what I'm talkin' about!
[03:07.240 --> 03:07.880]  Oh, no, Gavin!
[03:08.140 --> 03:09.980]  Oh, you won. Yeah, I still won.
[03:10.380 --> 03:11.320]  Good luck, Andrew.
[03:11.880 --> 03:13.300]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[03:13.300 --> 03:14.660]  I'm gettin' there!
[03:14.980 --> 03:17.080]  Take your time, take your time, take it easy.
[03:17.200 --> 03:18.000]  That thing will punch you!
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.780]  Oh, oh, oh!
[03:20.760 --> 03:22.180]  There you go!
[03:23.100 --> 03:24.380]  Points, points, points!
[03:24.840 --> 03:26.920]  Nice! And 90% to eat your shit!
[03:27.620 --> 03:29.080]  Andrew's got a small block.
[03:30.200 --> 03:31.340]  That's so funny!
[03:33.100 --> 03:33.480]  Oh!
[03:35.120 --> 03:35.700]  Interesting.
[03:37.940 --> 03:39.000]  No easy shit.
[03:39.440 --> 03:39.660]  Okay.
[03:40.380 --> 03:41.300]  Oh, God!
[03:42.120 --> 03:43.800]  Let's see what someone's doin' there.
[03:44.460 --> 03:45.300]  What are you talkin' about?
[03:46.780 --> 03:48.020]  Oh, Gavin has
[03:48.020 --> 03:49.240]  maybe killed us here.
[03:50.200 --> 03:51.340]  Nah, it'll open.
[03:52.140 --> 03:53.520]  Oh, what just blew up over there?
[03:54.540 --> 03:55.980]  Half of his, uh...
[03:55.980 --> 03:56.580]  Oh, shit!
[03:57.140 --> 03:58.700]  Oh, my God!
[03:59.100 --> 04:01.820]  It just whipped around his dead body!
[04:02.260 --> 04:03.920]  Oh, my God!
[04:04.420 --> 04:06.160]  Oh, my God!
[04:06.800 --> 04:08.020]  It fuckin'...
[04:08.020 --> 04:08.220]  He...
[04:12.140 --> 04:13.180]  That was
[04:13.180 --> 04:15.840]  so morbid!
[04:15.840 --> 04:18.320]  Oh, his corpse just...
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.040]  His corpse just
[04:20.040 --> 04:21.900]  flew around! Like, that was, like,
[04:21.980 --> 04:23.700]  some real space monkey shit!
[04:26.480 --> 04:26.960]  Ooh!
[04:27.640 --> 04:28.660]  Oh, we got black holes.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.760]  And flamethrowers!
[04:31.220 --> 04:32.420]  Oh, Jesus, guys!
[04:33.280 --> 04:34.760]  I had it too easy for too long!
[04:34.760 --> 04:36.720]  The worst thing I have does...
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.980]  Just put it right here.
[04:38.120 --> 04:40.900]  God, you guys are insane!
[04:41.360 --> 04:43.460]  I don't know if we can make it now.
[04:43.560 --> 04:44.340]  Alright, come on, you got it, Nick.
[04:44.780 --> 04:45.440]  Nick, no!
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.600]  Nick jumped to the spike again!
[04:49.680 --> 04:50.840]  Oh, no! Fuck!
[04:51.240 --> 04:51.440]  Ah!
[04:54.580 --> 04:57.200]  Oh, my God. Oh, it's so fuckin' funny, dude.
[04:57.780 --> 04:58.340]  Come on, Geoff.
[04:58.860 --> 04:59.480]  Goddammit, Geoff!
[05:01.320 --> 05:02.680]  Oh, Geoff, no!
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.060]  Gavin! Gavin!
[05:04.260 --> 05:04.700]  Oh, whatever.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.160]  Oh, my God!
[05:08.380 --> 05:09.340]  Jesus Christ.
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.580]  Alright, sweet.
[05:12.800 --> 05:14.340]  That's a solo and a trap kill.
[05:15.460 --> 05:16.560]  What a huge win.
[05:17.320 --> 05:18.480]  Thanks for watching, everybody!
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.140]  Oh, my God.
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.620]  So, let's fix Andrew's
[05:24.620 --> 05:25.680]  handicap first.
[05:26.060 --> 05:27.560]  Yeah, go fix that.
[05:28.900 --> 05:30.440]  Yeah, only you can do that, Andrew.
[05:30.440 --> 05:32.240]  You have to just add your 10 back.
[05:32.360 --> 05:32.640]  Wait.
[05:34.320 --> 05:35.860]  Oh, it's over here?
[05:36.280 --> 05:38.400]  Yeah, you must have bumped your head on minus 10.
[05:38.680 --> 05:39.760]  Definitely did.
[05:40.160 --> 05:41.680]  What an insane system.
[05:42.740 --> 05:44.280]  Andrew trying to add all the 10s.
[05:44.360 --> 05:44.640]  Give me more!
[05:46.360 --> 05:47.500]  I want a boost!
[05:48.380 --> 05:50.340]  17 of 21 levels unlocked.
[05:51.260 --> 05:52.520]  You play this game a lot, Gav.
[05:52.780 --> 05:53.960]  Alright. I used to.
[05:54.360 --> 05:55.240]  When was the last time you played it?
[05:56.060 --> 05:58.160]  Oh, a couple of years ago, maybe?
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.380]  Wow, really?
[05:59.720 --> 06:00.260]  Yeah.
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.280]  It doesn't show.
[06:05.380 --> 06:06.220]  Not at all.
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.160]  Okay, you're thinking that.
[06:09.140 --> 06:09.460]  Smart.
[06:09.980 --> 06:12.320]  Okay, we do need to be able to get...
[06:12.320 --> 06:12.660]  Okay.
[06:14.180 --> 06:15.520]  Let's give it a shot!
[06:18.520 --> 06:20.740]  I didn't even make the first jump.
[06:23.520 --> 06:25.080]  I can't get around, though.
[06:25.080 --> 06:26.220]  No, you got this!
[06:26.460 --> 06:26.600]  Gravity!
[06:28.680 --> 06:30.120]  Wait, you're a bird. What the hell?
[06:31.300 --> 06:32.920]  Alright, that one's deemed too hard.
[06:32.960 --> 06:34.620]  Okay, we did our job too well.
[06:35.500 --> 06:35.700]  Yeah.
[06:37.500 --> 06:39.420]  Oh, cool. So they gave you a black list of bombs.
[06:39.540 --> 06:39.820]  That's good.
[06:40.300 --> 06:43.280]  Alright, whoever's got that plank needs to...
[06:43.680 --> 06:44.660]  real help us out.
[06:45.800 --> 06:47.200]  Andrew, that bomb just
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.740]  blows stuff up that's already set.
[06:48.840 --> 06:48.960]  Yeah.
[06:51.180 --> 06:51.580]  Andrew.
[06:51.580 --> 06:53.980]  It's like he heard you,
[06:54.080 --> 06:55.600]  but he chose not to.
[06:55.800 --> 06:56.640]  That's pretty special.
[06:57.480 --> 06:58.820]  It destroys what's there.
[06:59.300 --> 07:01.240]  It's for getting rid of
[07:01.240 --> 07:03.720]  blockages and shit you hate.
[07:04.120 --> 07:06.840]  Why would you do that?
[07:08.200 --> 07:09.680]  You gotta run!
[07:09.800 --> 07:10.300]  Let's give it up!
[07:12.340 --> 07:12.620]  I...
[07:14.400 --> 07:15.560]  Fly, bird!
[07:16.140 --> 07:17.640]  I like when you
[07:17.640 --> 07:19.040]  explained what the bomb did,
[07:19.040 --> 07:21.780]  and it was like he didn't hear you.
[07:22.080 --> 07:22.900]  He just...
[07:22.900 --> 07:25.180]  I didn't trust it, and then I did.
[07:25.860 --> 07:27.200]  Everything's about, lately,
[07:27.300 --> 07:28.980]  what you do and do not trust.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.960]  Geoff, will you get the bomb and fix this, please?
[07:33.300 --> 07:33.760]  Thank you.
[07:34.380 --> 07:35.640]  I don't know.
[07:36.440 --> 07:37.780]  What does a clock do you get?
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.120]  I think it...
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.740]  Does it slow down time, maybe?
[07:44.880 --> 07:47.640]  Guys, you need a first platform to jump on.
[07:47.640 --> 07:49.880]  Right, they didn't give us one.
[07:51.020 --> 07:51.960]  Oh, there you go.
[07:52.000 --> 07:52.320]  Fuck.
[07:52.960 --> 07:54.880]  I see.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.960]  How did you make that jump?
[07:58.180 --> 07:59.580]  Oh my god.
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.800]  Okay, this is...
[08:05.960 --> 08:06.940]  See, it's easy.
[08:07.540 --> 08:08.440]  It's easy now.
[08:08.580 --> 08:10.360]  There you go.
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.080]  Let's just make it easy for Gavin.
[08:12.480 --> 08:15.640]  I can't even make that first jump
[08:15.640 --> 08:17.740]  to the fucking boxing gloves.
[08:18.720 --> 08:20.100]  Is there some jump mechanic
[08:20.100 --> 08:20.820]  I don't know about?
[08:21.220 --> 08:21.800]  Running.
[08:22.280 --> 08:24.640]  I'll put you a little thing below it.
[08:25.200 --> 08:25.840]  Oh, that's nice.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.420]  Um...
[08:32.500 --> 08:33.080]  Nice.
[08:35.160 --> 08:36.400]  Yeah, that's it right there.
[08:36.900 --> 08:37.220]  Yeah.
[08:38.540 --> 08:39.700]  Eat shit!
[08:40.160 --> 08:41.480]  Oh my god, Nick!
[08:42.100 --> 08:43.540]  Oh my god, he's dead.
[08:43.540 --> 08:44.000]  It's...
[08:45.880 --> 08:47.140]  Come on, Andrew, you got it.
[08:47.160 --> 08:48.060]  Oh, Geoff!
[08:53.180 --> 08:55.040]  We already know he can do this.
[08:55.120 --> 08:55.880]  We've seen him do it once.
[08:58.320 --> 08:59.500]  You were saying?
[09:02.680 --> 09:04.020]  Wow, I just slipped away.
[09:04.040 --> 09:04.460]  This game's so stupid.
[09:05.060 --> 09:07.320]  Do you know what the name means,
[09:07.480 --> 09:09.600]  Nick and Eric, and I guess Andrew?
[09:10.320 --> 09:10.660]  No.
[09:11.440 --> 09:13.040]  Because we talked to the creator
[09:13.040 --> 09:14.720]  one time, we did like a series with him.
[09:15.780 --> 09:16.840]  It's... the game is
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.860]  supposed to comprise the ultimate
[09:18.860 --> 09:20.860]  game of chicken and the ultimate game of horse.
[09:21.200 --> 09:21.760]  I see.
[09:22.180 --> 09:23.700]  I never made the connection.
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.140]  I had no idea that's why I was called that.
[09:27.340 --> 09:28.220]  Come on, Nick, you got it.
[09:28.300 --> 09:29.000]  Until just now?
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.540]  He told us in the thing we filmed.
[09:33.160 --> 09:33.900]  I wasn't in that.
[09:34.840 --> 09:36.940]  Okay, whoever has the coin
[09:36.940 --> 09:38.880]  gets like a whole extra point, basically.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.520]  It's like winning another round.
[09:40.520 --> 09:41.120]  You got it.
[09:42.300 --> 09:45.140]  When you die on that spike,
[09:45.280 --> 09:46.800]  I'll pick it up.
[09:46.800 --> 09:49.040]  There you go.
[09:55.400 --> 09:56.680]  Your hubris, Gavin.
[09:57.860 --> 09:59.560]  I didn't say I would finish with the coin.
[09:59.740 --> 10:00.620]  I just said I'd pick it up.
[10:01.620 --> 10:02.580]  You suck.
[10:03.100 --> 10:04.160]  You suck.
[10:04.220 --> 10:07.000]  I was always the worst at this game
[10:07.000 --> 10:08.120]  when we played with everyone else.
[10:08.940 --> 10:11.720]  What's it say right now that you're kicking the shit out of the rest of us?
[10:11.880 --> 10:12.580]  It's, you know,
[10:13.100 --> 10:14.200]  nothing good about us.
[10:16.800 --> 10:17.600]  There we go.
[10:19.780 --> 10:21.380]  Nick is crazy.
[10:22.120 --> 10:22.840]  Oh, shit.
[10:25.580 --> 10:26.680]  He just went.
[10:27.560 --> 10:28.000]  I did.
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.960]  Oh, no!
[10:34.560 --> 10:36.200]  Andrew lost the plot
[10:36.200 --> 10:38.100]  there for a second, and it was bad.
[10:38.900 --> 10:39.440]  Oh, Andrew.
[10:39.860 --> 10:41.200]  That's some bullshit!
[10:41.560 --> 10:43.140]  Oh, there's a wrecking ball there.
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.240]  I hate that!
[10:45.660 --> 10:48.120]  Your big fat body, I can't see the edge
[10:48.120 --> 10:48.680]  of the spike.
[10:49.780 --> 10:51.620]  Christ the Lord, cheater.
[10:52.600 --> 10:53.080]  Die.
[10:57.120 --> 10:58.060]  Oh, bitch.
[11:00.460 --> 11:02.700]  That wrecking ball is an issue.
[11:03.580 --> 11:04.860]  Oh, and the stuff with glue on,
[11:05.040 --> 11:06.180]  the stuff with honey on or whatever,
[11:06.400 --> 11:08.060]  you can stick, you can, like,
[11:08.100 --> 11:08.920]  create contraptions.
[11:09.660 --> 11:10.820]  Stick shit to other shit.
[11:10.940 --> 11:12.000]  You can make stuff move around.
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.080]  It's really fun.
[11:15.300 --> 11:17.380]  So I could do this, for example.
[11:17.960 --> 11:19.980]  Oh, you're an animal.
[11:20.140 --> 11:20.940]  You're a monster.
[11:22.100 --> 11:24.040]  Oh, wait, the wrecking ball at the top isn't even glued.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.320]  Okay, so I've just moved some stairs, I think.
[11:28.380 --> 11:28.960]  Achievement!
[11:29.940 --> 11:30.520]  Nice!
[11:31.620 --> 11:33.180]  Well, I didn't even fucking leave.
[11:33.340 --> 11:34.840]  God damn it.
[11:35.500 --> 11:37.940]  Geoff got fucking whammed.
[11:38.460 --> 11:40.300]  Geoff got fucking walloped.
[11:42.240 --> 11:42.820]  No!
[11:43.080 --> 11:43.320]  No!
[11:43.580 --> 11:44.540]  He fell through the thing!
[11:48.080 --> 11:48.520]  Uh-oh.
[11:48.760 --> 11:49.240]  Go Gavin!
[11:50.300 --> 11:50.880]  Yeah!
[11:51.580 --> 11:52.380]  Come on, Gavin!
[11:54.300 --> 11:55.380]  We're never gonna beat this.
[11:55.380 --> 11:58.540]  For some reason, I get all freaking panicky over there.
[11:58.620 --> 12:00.780]  I can't think when I'm over there.
[12:06.340 --> 12:07.300]  Oh, Christ.
[12:09.780 --> 12:11.060]  Oh, this is the best.
[12:12.280 --> 12:13.220]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[12:13.360 --> 12:14.680]  Nick, that will...
[12:14.680 --> 12:15.880]  Oh, that's a cog thing.
[12:16.440 --> 12:17.520]  I can't go under it.
[12:17.620 --> 12:18.740]  But you know what I can do?
[12:18.800 --> 12:22.020]  Oh, you want to collab?
[12:22.020 --> 12:23.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:23.260 --> 12:24.220]  Let's work together.
[12:24.580 --> 12:26.020]  Okay, ready?
[12:27.900 --> 12:28.580]  Nice!
[12:28.920 --> 12:30.220]  Alright, Geoff, you got this.
[12:30.340 --> 12:30.900]  Oh, my God.
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.020]  It's just fucking beating the fucking shit out of him.
[12:38.860 --> 12:38.880]  Oh, no!
[12:39.220 --> 12:41.780]  Which punched me back to the beginning.
[12:42.360 --> 12:43.760]  This level rocks.
[12:45.980 --> 12:47.000]  Look out!
[12:56.080 --> 12:57.380]  We're never gonna beat this.
[12:58.360 --> 12:59.200]  Oh, my God.
[13:03.920 --> 13:04.600]  Oh, man.
[13:05.140 --> 13:06.600]  I'll tell you what. Here's what I'm gonna do.
[13:07.120 --> 13:08.740]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[13:08.740 --> 13:11.200]  I'm just gonna get rid of the...
[13:11.660 --> 13:12.620]  Wait, someone blew up.
[13:14.300 --> 13:14.760]  That'll help.
[13:14.760 --> 13:15.440]  I'm gonna do this.
[13:17.420 --> 13:18.980]  God bless America.
[13:19.220 --> 13:20.880]  I look so scared.
[13:25.600 --> 13:26.180]  Oh, shit!
[13:26.640 --> 13:28.020]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[13:28.780 --> 13:30.100]  Have I got the coin?
[13:30.900 --> 13:31.920]  Yeah, you got it.
[13:32.320 --> 13:34.540]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[13:34.700 --> 13:35.880]  Oh, it's getting apart.
[13:36.600 --> 13:37.180]  It's going through it.
[13:37.880 --> 13:39.380]  I can't get down.
[13:39.620 --> 13:40.380]  It's going through it.
[13:46.230 --> 13:48.390]  Oh, my God.
[13:49.670 --> 13:58.670]  Oh, no, I didn't get the thing I wanted.
[13:59.810 --> 14:01.490]  Yeah, it's a real grab bag.
[14:02.470 --> 14:02.910]  Okay.
[14:03.370 --> 14:05.590]  Fuck, this is so fucking funny, dude.
[14:05.970 --> 14:06.610]  This is...
[14:06.610 --> 14:07.910]  Oh, this is, like, killing me.
[14:08.510 --> 14:10.610]  You see why we played this game 700 times?
[14:10.610 --> 14:11.490]  Oh, my God, yeah.
[14:11.870 --> 14:14.390]  Gavin getting panicky is just...
[14:14.390 --> 14:15.150]  This is so funny.
[14:15.470 --> 14:17.410]  Oh, that's a great placement.
[14:18.390 --> 14:19.310]  There you go.
[14:19.570 --> 14:20.250]  Oh, crap.
[14:21.490 --> 14:22.610]  No, Gavin!
[14:23.710 --> 14:25.810]  No, Geoff, God damn it!
[14:26.250 --> 14:27.790]  Oh, my God, I've made it.
[14:27.810 --> 14:29.190]  Oh, my God, how did you do that?
[14:29.590 --> 14:31.230]  Don't talk to me.
[14:34.890 --> 14:36.130]  Come on, Andrew.
[14:36.650 --> 14:38.010]  Oh, Andrew with the coin.
[14:38.230 --> 14:38.510]  Andrew!
[14:39.850 --> 14:40.370]  No!
[14:45.050 --> 14:46.670]  You piece of shit.
[14:48.150 --> 14:50.230]  Geoff with trap points.
[14:50.310 --> 14:51.350]  Yay, second place.
[14:51.570 --> 14:52.450]  Two turns left.
[14:52.570 --> 14:53.870]  Oh, my God.
[14:56.390 --> 14:57.990]  See, now because someone beat the level,
[14:58.050 --> 15:00.250]  it'll put in less destruction items.
[15:01.990 --> 15:03.830]  And more make it harder items.
[15:04.090 --> 15:04.670]  Yeah, Nick.
[15:05.790 --> 15:07.810]  I mean, you're not gonna get that far,
[15:07.870 --> 15:08.490]  so that's cool.
[15:09.530 --> 15:09.970]  No!
[15:09.970 --> 15:09.990]  No!
[15:12.050 --> 15:12.570]  Whoa!
[15:13.250 --> 15:15.770]  Dude, you got hit with a hockey puck so hard.
[15:15.770 --> 15:16.330]  I did.
[15:17.190 --> 15:17.630]  Oh, shit.
[15:18.890 --> 15:21.570]  Oh, my God, someone gave me the coin.
[15:21.830 --> 15:22.350]  Get him!
[15:22.990 --> 15:23.790]  Kill him!
[15:24.550 --> 15:26.970]  No, I'm panicking again.
[15:27.950 --> 15:29.330]  Oh, the hockey puck.
[15:32.690 --> 15:33.710]  You got this.
[15:33.890 --> 15:35.510]  Go, go, go, go.
[15:36.230 --> 15:37.030]  You gotta go.
[15:37.030 --> 15:37.550]  You gotta go.
[15:38.590 --> 15:38.890]  No!
[15:40.050 --> 15:42.390]  That was the worst case scenario.
[15:42.890 --> 15:43.450]  Oh, my God.
[15:43.710 --> 15:44.390]  That's it.
[15:46.090 --> 15:47.250]  What a champion.
[15:48.290 --> 15:49.590]  Oh, that's bullshit.
[15:50.510 --> 15:53.970]  That was truly impressive, Gavin.
[15:54.210 --> 15:54.810]  Congratulations.
[15:56.270 --> 15:58.770]  All right, what's another good level?
[15:59.250 --> 15:59.710]  Keep going.
[16:00.830 --> 16:02.030]  This is fucking...
[16:02.030 --> 16:03.450]  Oh, my God, this rocks.
[16:03.450 --> 16:05.830]  We're starting with the basic levels
[16:05.830 --> 16:07.970]  before they added in the crazy DLC ones.
[16:08.210 --> 16:08.470]  Right, right.
[16:09.530 --> 16:11.090]  Yeah, we're doing so well on the basic ones.
[16:11.090 --> 16:12.410]  Yeah, this feels pretty basic to me.
[16:14.290 --> 16:15.050]  Oh, dude.
[16:15.310 --> 16:16.610]  I don't think I've finished the level.
[16:17.170 --> 16:19.570]  I cannot believe we have not played this game before this.
[16:19.830 --> 16:21.330]  This is fucking awesome.
[16:26.370 --> 16:27.210]  Party box.
[16:29.210 --> 16:30.630]  Give me that fucking coin.
[16:30.630 --> 16:31.190]  Okay.
[16:31.190 --> 16:33.350]  I'm taking this coin.
[16:33.890 --> 16:34.990]  Oh, right, okay.
[16:37.010 --> 16:38.750]  What the fuck is that robot?
[16:38.930 --> 16:39.490]  You placed it backwards.
[16:40.090 --> 16:42.150]  It will throw paper airplanes,
[16:42.410 --> 16:43.590]  but they're going backwards.
[16:47.130 --> 16:48.370]  Come on, Nick!
[16:48.390 --> 16:49.310]  That throws you off!
[16:49.770 --> 16:51.890]  Go, Gavin, go!
[16:52.330 --> 16:53.070]  Oh, yeah!
[16:53.810 --> 16:56.790]  God bless America. I can't believe I gave you a win.
[16:57.730 --> 16:58.250]  Ugh.
[16:59.370 --> 17:00.710]  Oh, good job.
[17:02.070 --> 17:02.970]  Give me that coin.
[17:02.970 --> 17:04.630]  Andrew with the first and the coin.
[17:04.890 --> 17:05.130]  Wow.
[17:06.110 --> 17:06.630]  Ooh.
[17:09.130 --> 17:09.450]  Okay.
[17:19.620 --> 17:21.180]  Oh, what's going on down there?
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.420]  Oh, like a little emergency platform?
[17:24.900 --> 17:26.420]  Oh, yeah. That'll save us.
[17:26.740 --> 17:27.460]  There you go, Andrew.
[17:31.380 --> 17:31.900]  No!
[17:31.900 --> 17:32.840]  Oh, crap.
[17:32.840 --> 17:33.460]  God damn it.
[17:34.980 --> 17:37.340]  Oh, Geoff right through.
[17:37.760 --> 17:38.960]  Oh, great job, Geoff.
[17:39.440 --> 17:42.260]  Okay, let's look at these paper airplanes.
[17:42.260 --> 17:42.800]  You got this, Gavin.
[17:43.500 --> 17:44.580]  Gavin's gonna ride all the way.
[17:46.260 --> 17:47.720]  Oh, that's easy. Okay.
[17:48.540 --> 17:49.320]  Hold wide to Don's.
[17:49.540 --> 17:51.880]  Oh, wow. He's emoting all the way, dude.
[17:52.160 --> 17:52.580]  Wow.
[17:53.920 --> 17:54.640]  I'm embarrassed.
[17:54.740 --> 17:55.580]  Where are we dropping, boys?
[17:56.680 --> 17:57.160]  Huh!
[17:59.780 --> 18:00.260]  Okay.
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.220]  I don't like the noise he makes.
[18:03.020 --> 18:03.900]  My little bud?
[18:04.140 --> 18:04.340]  Yeah.
[18:06.900 --> 18:07.940]  I thought it was the squirrel
[18:07.940 --> 18:08.660]  making that noise.
[18:09.520 --> 18:11.100]  I don't think the squirrel makes noises, does he?
[18:12.380 --> 18:13.240]  I think he does.
[18:13.400 --> 18:15.600]  You gotta stop the paper airplanes.
[18:16.020 --> 18:17.660]  You guys have to stop the airplanes.
[18:17.880 --> 18:20.520]  Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[18:21.020 --> 18:21.700]  Oh, fuck.
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.140]  Gavin, you're crazy.
[18:25.100 --> 18:26.340]  Oh, I like it, Gavin.
[18:26.580 --> 18:28.280]  Oh, my God.
[18:28.600 --> 18:29.300]  A little bit of peril.
[18:29.820 --> 18:30.480]  I like it.
[18:31.680 --> 18:32.580]  What am I doing?
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.680]  What am I doing?
[18:36.420 --> 18:36.940]  Nick!
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.460]  That was my own save!
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.740]  Nick got swept in! Nick gets a post-mortem.
[18:42.460 --> 18:42.700]  Yeah!
[18:43.340 --> 18:45.600]  He died and got swept into the finish line.
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.000]  That was awesome.
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.160]  What a comeback.
[18:48.160 --> 18:48.540]  What a comeback.
[18:51.680 --> 18:53.300]  Ooh, the coin.
[18:54.080 --> 18:56.600]  You guys gotta block the fucking thing.
[18:57.180 --> 18:58.900]  Like, Gavin's vaulting in.
[18:59.520 --> 18:59.640]  Yeah.
[19:02.920 --> 19:03.540]  Oh.
[19:04.780 --> 19:05.400]  Interesting.
[19:08.300 --> 19:09.760]  There's coins galore.
[19:11.340 --> 19:13.080]  Oh, that really makes you want to get it.
[19:13.180 --> 19:13.600]  Look at that.
[19:16.580 --> 19:17.320]  We're on it.
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.500]  Oh, Nick!
[19:19.020 --> 19:19.400]  Shit.
[19:19.540 --> 19:19.940]  The fan.
[19:21.560 --> 19:22.220]  Not Geoff!
[19:22.440 --> 19:24.800]  The bird's already there.
[19:25.380 --> 19:28.360]  Oh, Andrew's going for a double coin game snatch.
[19:28.720 --> 19:28.740]  Oh, fuck!
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.600]  Yeah, but you can't. You can only get the one.
[19:31.420 --> 19:32.480]  No, he can get...
[19:32.480 --> 19:33.720]  He's not gonna be able to get up there.
[19:34.320 --> 19:35.540]  How am I gonna get up there?
[19:36.380 --> 19:39.040]  You could jump up the back.
[19:39.040 --> 19:40.340]  Oh, okay.
[19:41.720 --> 19:43.320]  What's the sprint button? Is it A?
[19:44.020 --> 19:44.900]  Uh, X.
[19:45.020 --> 19:45.460]  I think it's X.
[19:46.540 --> 19:47.940]  Oh, there's a sprint button?
[19:48.480 --> 19:48.960]  Yeah.
[19:49.480 --> 19:51.320]  It's a platforming game.
[19:51.920 --> 19:52.480]  Shit!
[19:53.920 --> 19:55.540]  That changes everything.
[19:56.120 --> 19:56.560]  That's pretty cool.
[19:57.660 --> 19:58.660]  Holy shit.
[20:00.700 --> 20:01.780]  I mean...
[20:01.780 --> 20:02.620]  Barely a win.
[20:04.460 --> 20:05.520]  That was unfortunate.
[20:05.820 --> 20:06.960]  That never got going, that one.
[20:06.960 --> 20:09.560]  If Andrew had taken those two coins to the end,
[20:09.640 --> 20:10.320]  that would have been crazy.
[20:10.420 --> 20:13.300]  I would try and... Hey, I got a sprint now.
[20:13.700 --> 20:14.520]  This is a game changer.
[20:15.320 --> 20:16.960]  Do you want to do that level again and make it last longer?
[20:17.360 --> 20:17.680]  Sure.
[20:19.120 --> 20:21.360]  Let me swap out characters as well.
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.700]  Oh, you think the problem is you're an elephant.
[20:24.300 --> 20:24.700]  Yeah.
[20:24.840 --> 20:26.620]  If you hold right trigger, I think you can also run.
[20:27.480 --> 20:27.720]  Okay.
[20:28.620 --> 20:29.720]  It was so fast.
[20:33.320 --> 20:34.600]  We got a question mark.
[20:34.600 --> 20:36.760]  Not yet.
[20:37.720 --> 20:38.660]  I might on this level.
[20:38.860 --> 20:40.000]  There's a big question mark.
[20:44.160 --> 20:45.200]  Oh my.
[20:46.020 --> 20:47.380]  What are those?
[20:48.240 --> 20:48.820]  What are those?
[20:49.580 --> 20:50.840]  Let's go up.
[20:52.920 --> 20:54.020]  They're unlockables.
[20:59.340 --> 20:59.900]  We're together?
[21:00.940 --> 21:01.180]  Sure.
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.780]  Not Geoff.
[21:07.020 --> 21:08.420]  I don't know if we can reach that
[21:08.420 --> 21:09.520]  now that I've put it there.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.040]  Ah, we got it.
[21:14.830 --> 21:16.490]  You got it. You just gotta double jump.
[21:17.290 --> 21:17.930]  Jump, bam.
[21:19.590 --> 21:20.470]  Oh god.
[21:21.190 --> 21:22.850]  Level discovered for Andrew Panton.
[21:23.230 --> 21:23.910]  Wow, Geoff.
[21:25.990 --> 21:26.430]  Geoff.
[21:27.970 --> 21:28.850]  Keep climbing.
[21:31.510 --> 21:32.650]  Come on, Geoff.
[21:32.930 --> 21:33.410]  What are you doing?
[21:34.250 --> 21:35.390]  I can't get up.
[21:36.250 --> 21:37.530]  Oh my god, what am I doing?
[21:38.270 --> 21:40.770]  You gotta jump once you're on the...
[21:40.770 --> 21:41.770]  Ah, there you go.
[21:42.050 --> 21:43.370]  God, I did it again.
[21:44.410 --> 21:45.170]  Come on, man. You got it.
[21:45.370 --> 21:46.150]  That's okay. I got it.
[21:47.130 --> 21:48.230]  You got this, Nick.
[21:49.410 --> 21:50.090]  Oh, no.
[21:51.370 --> 21:51.970]  There you go.
[21:53.470 --> 21:54.970]  Now you gotta sprint.
[21:55.110 --> 21:57.010]  I don't know where it is. I can't see anything.
[21:59.170 --> 22:02.970]  Oh, Andrew changes color. That's so cool.
[22:03.290 --> 22:04.010]  That's really cool.
[22:04.850 --> 22:06.790]  Man, if the map hadn't shrunk.
[22:07.250 --> 22:08.590]  Yeah, I don't know how you combat that.
[22:09.150 --> 22:09.950]  Oh, bees.
[22:10.130 --> 22:10.910]  Oh, shit.
[22:11.430 --> 22:13.210]  What do they do? I assume they swarm.
[22:13.330 --> 22:16.490]  The first person who triggers the bees will then trail bees
[22:16.490 --> 22:17.290]  for the rest of the level.
[22:17.970 --> 22:18.810]  That will kill them.
[22:20.150 --> 22:21.430]  But you can weaponize them.
[22:21.810 --> 22:24.210]  You can grab bees and then run into other people with them.
[22:24.570 --> 22:25.010]  That's cool.
[22:25.230 --> 22:25.850]  I'm feeling like a bastard.
[22:27.270 --> 22:28.330]  Can we land on the platform?
[22:29.790 --> 22:30.510]  Yeah, the bee platform.
[22:31.230 --> 22:32.330]  I don't think you can jump.
[22:32.370 --> 22:33.350]  I don't think you can land on the bees.
[22:34.510 --> 22:35.390]  Let's just do this.
[22:36.870 --> 22:37.550]  Oh, fuck.
[22:38.150 --> 22:38.990]  Nick has the bees!
[22:41.030 --> 22:42.270]  The bees killed Andrew!
[22:44.490 --> 22:46.010]  Wait, where did Geoff go?
[22:46.430 --> 22:46.670]  Geoff?
[22:46.910 --> 22:47.290]  Geoff fell.
[22:47.950 --> 22:50.530]  He got scared of the bees.
[22:51.190 --> 22:52.310]  He thought the bees were snakes.
[22:52.450 --> 22:53.090]  He got out of there.
[22:54.270 --> 22:56.230]  I'm gonna have to jump around this frickin' spike, am I?
[22:56.570 --> 22:56.770]  Yeah.
[22:56.770 --> 22:58.470]  Oh, God.
[22:59.110 --> 23:00.470]  Oh, God.
[23:00.830 --> 23:01.670]  Good luck.
[23:02.030 --> 23:03.650]  You got it.
[23:04.630 --> 23:05.450]  Easy, baby.
[23:06.790 --> 23:08.290]  What a jump!
[23:08.910 --> 23:10.130]  How do I zoom?
[23:10.930 --> 23:12.470]  You don't. Just haul ass.
[23:14.550 --> 23:15.270]  Geronies!
[23:16.510 --> 23:16.790]  Oh!
[23:16.950 --> 23:18.090]  Oh, my God!
[23:18.550 --> 23:21.170]  This is some bullshit.
[23:21.290 --> 23:22.490]  We gotta stop it.
[23:24.710 --> 23:25.590]  All right.
[23:25.670 --> 23:26.570]  New quest.
[23:26.790 --> 23:27.110]  Damn it!
[23:32.710 --> 23:34.650]  Where do I put this?
[23:35.930 --> 23:37.570]  What do I want to do with this?
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.080]  Okay.
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.580]  Oh!
[23:50.380 --> 23:50.740]  Oh!
[23:51.240 --> 23:52.360]  Damn it, Nick!
[23:52.980 --> 23:53.580]  Yes!
[23:54.400 --> 23:55.260]  I did it, guys!
[23:55.560 --> 23:56.580]  I saved you!
[23:56.980 --> 23:58.060]  Take that, Gavin!
[23:59.740 --> 24:01.420]  Son of a bitch!
[24:02.900 --> 24:03.660]  Gainin' on him.
[24:04.420 --> 24:05.840]  I'll do everything I can.
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.220]  It's the power of bees, baby.
[24:11.940 --> 24:13.760]  We can't let him get that coin.
[24:14.460 --> 24:15.400]  He can't be first.
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.180]  Oh, Gavin is looking for the easy way out.
[24:19.240 --> 24:20.660]  He wants to ride it all the way to victory.
[24:21.900 --> 24:22.400]  Oh, fuck!
[24:22.660 --> 24:23.960]  What are you doing?
[24:24.140 --> 24:25.200]  He can't be first!
[24:27.080 --> 24:28.760]  Oh, my God!
[24:28.760 --> 24:30.100]  I freaked out.
[24:30.160 --> 24:30.680]  Yeah!
[24:31.820 --> 24:33.140]  Take that, Gavin!
[24:36.820 --> 24:37.860]  Oh, shit!
[24:38.320 --> 24:39.760]  Now we have to stop Andrew?
[24:42.020 --> 24:43.680]  Sprint is a whole new game.
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.880]  Didn't you practice this earlier?
[24:49.340 --> 24:51.060]  No, you told me to, and I did.
[24:51.480 --> 24:53.160]  I did. I said you should probably practice.
[24:53.160 --> 24:53.740]  I didn't.
[24:53.900 --> 24:56.000]  I said you should get a feel for the physics.
[24:56.000 --> 24:56.820]  Uh-huh.
[24:56.960 --> 24:58.420]  I'm gonna put that here.
[24:59.940 --> 25:00.840]  Oh, my God!
[25:00.920 --> 25:01.960]  What is happening?
[25:02.640 --> 25:02.660]  No!
[25:03.120 --> 25:07.180]  How are you alive?
[25:07.580 --> 25:08.140]  No!
[25:08.720 --> 25:09.460]  No!
[25:14.400 --> 25:15.900]  He's flying to greatness!
[25:17.220 --> 25:19.220]  You son of a bitch!
[25:20.360 --> 25:22.060]  You son of a bitch!
[25:22.200 --> 25:22.800]  No!
[25:22.800 --> 25:24.000]  How far does this go?
[25:24.580 --> 25:25.980]  Die from going out of frame.
[25:26.180 --> 25:26.860]  How do you find out?
[25:29.660 --> 25:31.240]  Please be dead.
[25:31.480 --> 25:32.000]  Yeah!
[25:38.500 --> 25:40.400]  I've never done that before.
[25:41.980 --> 25:43.040]  I didn't even see where I went.
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.820]  That was like a jump scare.
[25:48.260 --> 25:49.240]  Oh, God.
[25:51.060 --> 25:51.940]  There you go.
[25:51.940 --> 25:53.620]  Oh, what the...
[25:53.620 --> 25:56.960]  No, no, no. You gotta put a stop to the fucking airplane, dude.
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.580]  I put a stop to it.
[25:58.600 --> 25:59.040]  Oh, you're right.
[25:59.660 --> 26:01.260]  Except nobody's gonna make it the other way.
[26:01.400 --> 26:02.460]  I put a stop to it already.
[26:03.900 --> 26:04.880]  Oh, yeah, he stopped it.
[26:05.260 --> 26:06.200]  Oh, you did stop it. Okay.
[26:07.640 --> 26:08.940]  There's a bit of glue there that's unused.
[26:11.480 --> 26:11.800]  Five.
[26:12.060 --> 26:12.380]  Four.
[26:12.560 --> 26:12.880]  Three.
[26:13.860 --> 26:15.020]  There you go.
[26:15.880 --> 26:16.940]  Oh, you pushed me into it!
[26:16.940 --> 26:17.720]  Oh, you pushed me!
[26:20.640 --> 26:22.020]  That's so stupid.
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.560]  Immediate bees.
[26:24.860 --> 26:25.720]  Oh, my God.
[26:29.380 --> 26:31.140]  No! Damn. Fuck.
[26:31.680 --> 26:32.000]  Shit.
[26:35.510 --> 26:38.090]  The projectiles are also affected by black holes.
[26:40.150 --> 26:42.410]  So you can get some real gnarly stuff happening.
[26:44.670 --> 26:45.810]  Oh, for God's sake.
[26:45.810 --> 26:47.590]  What does that mean? Does it, like, warp the direction?
[26:47.850 --> 26:48.250]  Bees!
[26:48.810 --> 26:49.210]  No!
[26:51.510 --> 26:55.250]  Yeah, you see what it's doing to the mortar there?
[26:55.410 --> 26:56.070]  Yeah, I see.
[26:58.230 --> 26:58.630]  Whoa!
[26:59.070 --> 27:00.190]  Dude, this is a nightmare.
[27:00.690 --> 27:03.890]  This suddenly got so much worse.
[27:07.990 --> 27:09.150]  I want this.
[27:10.450 --> 27:11.750]  Ooh, how do I want to do this?
[27:15.810 --> 27:18.710]  Now that is an interesting bit.
[27:23.020 --> 27:24.320]  Ah, shit.
[27:24.440 --> 27:25.400]  I got the bees again!
[27:25.800 --> 27:27.940]  Oh, fuck.
[27:28.720 --> 27:28.980]  No!
[27:29.460 --> 27:31.560]  Oh, Nick's on fire.
[27:32.120 --> 27:32.960]  Oh, Nick.
[27:33.740 --> 27:34.980]  Wait, wait, wait. Patience.
[27:35.500 --> 27:37.400]  Oh, no!
[27:38.620 --> 27:40.580]  Nick, you could've ridden the airplane
[27:40.580 --> 27:41.700]  all the way.
[27:42.320 --> 27:43.320]  No, they were getting blown up.
[27:43.880 --> 27:45.800]  Oh, I see.
[27:48.760 --> 27:50.180]  It was a mistake to record
[27:50.180 --> 27:52.000]  the screaming video at the beginning of the day.
[27:53.580 --> 27:56.320]  I have a feeling they might all be screaming videos.
[27:56.340 --> 27:57.300]  Oh, wait.
[28:00.780 --> 28:01.900]  Ooh, that's fun.
[28:01.980 --> 28:02.780]  I like that idea.
[28:04.780 --> 28:06.020]  There's a giant wall
[28:06.020 --> 28:06.960]  in the middle of the map now.
[28:12.460 --> 28:13.380]  Eh, whatever.
[28:15.000 --> 28:15.860]  Oh, fuck.
[28:15.860 --> 28:17.980]  I always forget about the bees!
[28:18.320 --> 28:19.680]  For God's sake.
[28:20.060 --> 28:21.480]  All of us instantly.
[28:21.480 --> 28:24.040]  I really love the bees
[28:24.040 --> 28:26.540]  so much. I love the bees.
[28:26.840 --> 28:28.340]  The bees have been my favorite part.
[28:28.700 --> 28:29.500]  Uh, if
[28:30.100 --> 28:32.200]  we don't win in the next three turns
[28:32.200 --> 28:33.920]  is it a tie, or is it whoever has the most points?
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.720]  No, it's just whatever score is current.
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.300]  Oh, okay.
[28:37.440 --> 28:40.220]  So it's in, uh, I guess your best interest
[28:40.220 --> 28:41.320]  that we never score.
[28:41.600 --> 28:41.960]  Yeah.
[28:47.060 --> 28:47.900]  Maybe this
[28:47.900 --> 28:49.480]  will move immediately down
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.020]  and block the bees.
[28:52.280 --> 28:53.260]  Maybe not.
[28:53.780 --> 28:55.270]  Yeah, I'd think it not, but we'll see.
[28:56.400 --> 28:57.460]  Seems like a bee
[28:57.460 --> 28:58.380]  could fit through those.
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.040]  A bee could fit.
[29:06.420 --> 29:07.580]  It's worse!
[29:07.940 --> 29:08.660]  It's worse!
[29:09.740 --> 29:11.240]  Oh, my God.
[29:11.580 --> 29:12.820]  You created an elevator
[29:12.820 --> 29:15.320]  like a guillotine.
[29:15.700 --> 29:17.220]  You made it so much worse.
[29:18.140 --> 29:18.520]  Okay.
[29:18.800 --> 29:20.740]  Alright, I'm just gonna run straight through it.
[29:20.900 --> 29:21.580]  Oh, no, the goo!
[29:22.800 --> 29:23.760]  Okay, I got a plan.
[29:24.380 --> 29:26.120]  I'm gonna move the bees.
[29:27.880 --> 29:28.300]  Nice.
[29:28.980 --> 29:30.760]  And the thing will come down, and hopefully
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.040]  no one will get bees'd.
[29:32.980 --> 29:33.900]  Oh, go. Alright.
[29:34.540 --> 29:36.500]  What is happening there? There's no room.
[29:40.940 --> 29:41.980]  Oh, no.
[29:44.740 --> 29:46.220]  Son of a bitch.
[29:46.720 --> 29:48.460]  Alright, it's the last turn. I'm blowing the bees.
[29:48.680 --> 29:49.300]  I don't give a shit.
[29:50.440 --> 29:51.960]  I'm blowing Eric's bees.
[29:52.580 --> 29:54.120]  I love the bees!
[29:54.940 --> 29:56.700]  Give me a bomb.
[29:56.860 --> 29:57.280]  There we go.
[30:01.020 --> 30:02.880]  Those are the most weaponized
[30:02.880 --> 30:03.800]  bees I've ever seen.
[30:07.220 --> 30:08.080]  Frickin' bees.
[30:09.940 --> 30:10.720]  There is
[30:10.720 --> 30:12.640]  so much that we haven't even touched because
[30:12.640 --> 30:14.440]  of the bees, I don't even know how to process
[30:14.440 --> 30:15.480]  the rest of the course.
[30:16.360 --> 30:17.380]  I'm still dead.
[30:18.980 --> 30:20.100]  Oh, God!
[30:20.380 --> 30:21.860]  Kill him! Gavin's alive?
[30:22.200 --> 30:24.180]  Are you shitting me?
[30:24.460 --> 30:25.100]  Kill him!
[30:25.740 --> 30:26.780]  Kill him!
[30:29.320 --> 30:29.640]  No!
[30:30.700 --> 30:31.880]  He did it!
[30:31.880 --> 30:32.300]  He did it!
[30:34.180 --> 30:34.660]  Oh!
[30:35.620 --> 30:36.620]  He's still short!
[30:37.060 --> 30:39.940]  The coin! The coin from before!
[30:41.620 --> 30:44.060]  He won by a smidge. If your 90%
[30:44.060 --> 30:45.740]  thing was here, turn on how to won that.
[30:48.540 --> 30:50.100]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[30:50.340 --> 30:52.020]  You were clearly the ultimate
[30:52.020 --> 30:53.340]  chicken wars. Undeniably.
[30:54.940 --> 30:56.100]  Undeniable champion.
[30:56.540 --> 30:58.040]  Easily the best among us.
[30:58.760 --> 30:59.380]  We wanna do one more?
[30:59.380 --> 31:00.180]  Yeah, one more.
[31:01.700 --> 31:02.840]  Let's do a new level.
[31:03.340 --> 31:04.140]  Let's just vote.
[31:05.260 --> 31:07.800]  3, 2, 1
[31:08.380 --> 31:09.540]  Let's do this.
[31:11.140 --> 31:12.020]  Pyramid it is.
[31:12.540 --> 31:12.740]  Alright.
[31:15.620 --> 31:17.120]  Holy hell, that was insane.
[31:19.100 --> 31:20.320]  Let's get some ice.
[31:20.940 --> 31:23.880]  You gotta cool him down, Andrew.
[31:24.500 --> 31:25.600]  We've not seen a
[31:25.600 --> 31:26.940]  portal yet, which is weird.
[31:28.340 --> 31:29.440]  You can create little
[31:30.560 --> 31:31.440]  portal paths.
[31:32.460 --> 31:33.640]  So, is the sand
[31:33.640 --> 31:35.700]  not poisonous? Can we land on it?
[31:36.060 --> 31:37.500]  The circular one is.
[31:37.600 --> 31:38.780]  This quicksand will kill you.
[31:39.600 --> 31:41.080]  Where do I place this?
[31:41.240 --> 31:43.540]  Nick seems to know a lot for a guy who didn't play this game.
[31:43.820 --> 31:44.520]  I've played this game.
[31:45.040 --> 31:46.240]  Where do I place this?
[31:46.780 --> 31:47.480]  He's cheating.
[31:48.120 --> 31:50.220]  You placed it on the ceiling of the cave.
[31:51.100 --> 31:52.320]  Way to go, man.
[31:56.290 --> 31:56.620]  Oh.
[31:57.700 --> 31:58.360]  Wow.
[32:00.820 --> 32:02.580]  God bless America.
[32:02.880 --> 32:03.900]  Points because of Nick.
[32:04.940 --> 32:05.600]  America.
[32:07.360 --> 32:08.700]  I think the name
[32:08.700 --> 32:10.160]  of this video needs to be
[32:10.160 --> 32:11.480]  God bless America.
[32:11.800 --> 32:13.460]  Nick just keeps saying it.
[32:14.700 --> 32:15.560]  I'm trying not to...
[32:16.480 --> 32:18.220]  I'm trying not to...
[32:19.340 --> 32:20.480]  Try not to say
[32:21.380 --> 32:21.900]  Yeah.
[32:24.880 --> 32:26.540]  That's a whole lot.
[32:28.880 --> 32:32.120]  Gavin, what are you doing?
[32:32.640 --> 32:34.500]  I'm figuring stuff out.
[32:34.880 --> 32:35.580]  I like it.
[32:35.900 --> 32:37.340]  Am I just a lady or am I stupid?
[32:39.280 --> 32:39.800]  Oops!
[32:40.740 --> 32:41.720]  Oh God, I almost died.
[32:42.040 --> 32:42.940]  There you go, Nick.
[32:43.600 --> 32:44.920]  There you go, Nick.
[32:47.640 --> 32:48.680]  No points.
[32:48.680 --> 32:49.860]  Die, Andrew, die!
[32:49.960 --> 32:51.860]  Too easy. Baby mode.
[32:51.880 --> 32:54.840]  The only time you can get...
[32:55.720 --> 32:56.860]  Let's do a big boy level
[32:56.860 --> 32:57.740]  for the big boys.
[32:59.220 --> 32:59.720]  There we go.
[33:00.140 --> 33:01.060]  Oh, no one picked a coin.
[33:01.920 --> 33:02.840]  That's crazy.
[33:04.200 --> 33:06.280]  Oh, we have to inflict pain first, Gavin.
[33:11.780 --> 33:12.260]  Okay.
[33:13.320 --> 33:14.540]  I always go right.
[33:16.020 --> 33:16.500]  Motherfucker.
[33:16.740 --> 33:18.260]  Oh, that's a...
[33:18.260 --> 33:19.980]  I assumed that'd be a good thing.
[33:19.980 --> 33:22.140]  Oh, come on.
[33:24.550 --> 33:24.950]  Oh!
[33:25.370 --> 33:27.590]  This is a little difficult now, isn't it?
[33:28.290 --> 33:29.550]  Oh, shit!
[33:29.990 --> 33:31.170]  Oh my God!
[33:31.670 --> 33:33.230]  I went for it there and just ate knobs.
[33:33.410 --> 33:33.710]  Nick, go!
[33:34.950 --> 33:36.770]  Nick, you gotta land on that platform when it's ready.
[33:37.070 --> 33:37.750]  Go, now!
[33:38.490 --> 33:38.890]  No!
[33:41.250 --> 33:42.550]  Did exactly what I did.
[33:45.290 --> 33:46.090]  Too hard.
[33:47.590 --> 33:48.230]  We can do it.
[33:48.230 --> 33:49.410]  Too easy, too hard.
[33:52.250 --> 33:52.650]  Whoops.
[33:53.690 --> 33:54.230]  What did I just do?
[33:56.530 --> 33:56.890]  Sure.
[34:04.420 --> 34:05.060]  Why you mad?
[34:05.120 --> 34:05.460]  Oh, right.
[34:08.600 --> 34:10.640]  You're gonna freeze the sphinx's head?
[34:10.860 --> 34:11.840]  Yeah, I'm gonna keep it cool.
[34:12.460 --> 34:12.940]  He's good.
[34:13.280 --> 34:14.080]  He's got a fever.
[34:18.360 --> 34:19.740]  I don't know if that helped or hindered.
[34:20.060 --> 34:21.280]  Oh, my thing just exploded.
[34:22.340 --> 34:22.740]  Oh!
[34:24.560 --> 34:26.220]  Oh, look at Geoff!
[34:28.180 --> 34:28.700]  Yes!
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.580]  Geoff was silent but deadly that whole time, man.
[34:31.660 --> 34:32.360]  It doesn't matter.
[34:32.740 --> 34:33.600]  Andrew's gonna make it.
[34:34.020 --> 34:34.480]  Fuck!
[34:38.360 --> 34:39.720]  First points to Geoff.
[34:40.280 --> 34:42.020]  Thank you very much.
[34:42.660 --> 34:43.540]  Oh, Geoff and Gavin.
[34:43.760 --> 34:43.940]  Close.
[34:46.720 --> 34:47.760]  Uh-oh.
[34:47.920 --> 34:48.720]  Did we both get that?
[34:50.040 --> 34:50.680]  Uh-oh.
[34:50.680 --> 34:52.020]  How did that happen?
[34:52.740 --> 34:54.360]  We reached it at the same moment.
[34:54.940 --> 34:55.840]  Lag, I guess.
[34:57.720 --> 34:58.800]  There you go.
[34:59.020 --> 35:00.560]  You thought it was hard before.
[35:03.420 --> 35:04.400]  Oh, my God.
[35:05.860 --> 35:07.040]  Geoff got...
[35:07.040 --> 35:09.300]  Why does that fucking flower
[35:09.300 --> 35:11.240]  hate me specifically?
[35:14.840 --> 35:17.020]  I'm not going that way.
[35:17.200 --> 35:18.540]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:18.540 --> 35:19.280]  Wait, wait, wait.
[35:19.780 --> 35:20.140]  No!
[35:23.160 --> 35:24.560]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[35:25.460 --> 35:26.180]  Pulling Nick out.
[35:27.240 --> 35:27.640]  Oh!
[35:28.700 --> 35:30.240]  Gavin got blasted.
[35:31.900 --> 35:36.360]  I think we gotta make it tougher.
[35:38.020 --> 35:38.820]  Oh, damn.
[35:39.200 --> 35:39.920]  Get the coin, baby.
[35:41.060 --> 35:42.560]  Nick, Nick, get the coin and win.
[35:42.880 --> 35:44.800]  You got this. You know exactly what to do.
[35:44.940 --> 35:45.720]  You got this.
[35:45.720 --> 35:47.380]  This is fucking baby-mode shit. Let's go.
[35:47.940 --> 35:49.180]  Yeah, goo-goo-ga-ga.
[35:49.560 --> 35:51.080]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[35:56.060 --> 35:56.960]  Don't do it, Geoff.
[35:57.040 --> 35:57.780]  Ah, damn it.
[35:59.180 --> 36:00.200]  Race to the coin!
[36:02.120 --> 36:03.860]  Oh, I took a freaking hour.
[36:04.220 --> 36:04.700]  You got it, you got it, you got it.
[36:04.900 --> 36:05.920]  Back to the end.
[36:07.400 --> 36:09.800]  You just gotta think. Nick, just think about it.
[36:10.140 --> 36:11.000]  Just think about it.
[36:11.060 --> 36:12.520]  Nick, you got it.
[36:12.520 --> 36:13.700]  Andrew is punching Geoff.
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.400]  I'm trying.
[36:16.420 --> 36:17.800]  Geoff blasted to the end.
[36:17.980 --> 36:18.360]  Wow.
[36:20.360 --> 36:21.500]  Good job, Geoff.
[36:22.020 --> 36:23.040]  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[36:23.220 --> 36:23.880]  Fuck this.
[36:25.660 --> 36:26.760]  Nick's in a predicament.
[36:28.440 --> 36:29.340]  He's done it.
[36:29.780 --> 36:30.420]  He's on the thing.
[36:32.260 --> 36:32.740]  Yeah!
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.040]  What a claim by Nick.
[36:35.880 --> 36:36.620]  Oh, oh, oh.
[36:38.780 --> 36:40.160]  Right there, dude.
[36:40.920 --> 36:42.380]  Guys, we're at about 40 minutes.
[36:42.440 --> 36:43.280]  We should probably stop right now.
[36:43.320 --> 36:45.060]  No, no, no, no.
[36:45.180 --> 36:46.260]  Let me have my moment.
[36:47.200 --> 36:50.160]  Oh, shit.
[36:51.140 --> 36:51.420]  Do it.
[36:51.480 --> 36:53.480]  You guys are insane.
[36:54.120 --> 36:54.960]  No more fans.
[36:55.360 --> 36:57.320]  That was a really good play.
[36:58.080 --> 36:59.500]  Yeah, that's cool.
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.400]  I like the way Gavin's thinking.
[37:01.680 --> 37:03.840]  You're gonna get punched here or you're gonna get punched there.
[37:04.460 --> 37:04.880]  Do it.
[37:06.020 --> 37:07.460]  Son of a bitch.
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.280]  Can't go up.
[37:12.400 --> 37:12.800]  Not that way.
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.660]  This is terrible.
[37:15.820 --> 37:16.760]  I already got it, man.
[37:19.460 --> 37:20.200]  Oh, yeah, that'll get you.
[37:20.400 --> 37:21.640]  I thought it would miss my tail, but no.
[37:21.880 --> 37:23.940]  It's the hitbox.
[37:24.620 --> 37:26.500]  You're there, you're there, you're there!
[37:27.160 --> 37:27.580]  No!
[37:27.880 --> 37:28.540]  Gavin, no!
[37:29.280 --> 37:29.700]  Dang.
[37:30.400 --> 37:31.580]  What does this mean?
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.440]  What does this mean for the score?
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.560]  A couple of traps.
[37:39.300 --> 37:40.880]  Nick, you just need one more, dude.
[37:41.100 --> 37:42.320]  That's all you need is one more.
[37:43.340 --> 37:44.100]  Oh, God.
[37:45.460 --> 37:47.140]  Nick, you just gotta block him at the top, dude.
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.380]  This is the first video
[37:49.380 --> 37:50.360]  and I'm sweating so hard.
[37:51.340 --> 37:53.710]  Nick, you can't let him use the fucking cannon.
[37:54.960 --> 37:56.640]  You gotta block the cannon, dude.
[37:56.840 --> 37:58.020]  You can't let him use the fucking cannon.
[37:58.440 --> 37:59.240]  Oh, that's horrible.
[37:59.480 --> 38:00.580]  That's horrible what you've done there.
[38:00.580 --> 38:01.420]  Oh, shit.
[38:01.420 --> 38:02.600]  Oh, get punched!
[38:02.980 --> 38:03.660]  Oh, my God.
[38:03.980 --> 38:06.340]  I didn't know that was possible.
[38:06.760 --> 38:07.480]  Oh, damn it.
[38:09.660 --> 38:11.180]  Wait for it, wait for it.
[38:11.480 --> 38:12.860]  Wait for it, bury it.
[38:13.380 --> 38:13.900]  Go, Nick, go.
[38:15.180 --> 38:15.780]  Yeah, there you go.
[38:17.140 --> 38:18.240]  Nick, you got it.
[38:18.460 --> 38:19.900]  You know exactly where you're going.
[38:20.840 --> 38:21.480]  This is it.
[38:23.040 --> 38:24.460]  Nick, you just play your game.
[38:25.040 --> 38:25.220]  Ready?
[38:25.800 --> 38:27.800]  Oh, God.
[38:27.800 --> 38:28.020]  Oh, God.
[38:29.600 --> 38:30.400]  Play the scope.
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.600]  Oh, he went right in.
[38:34.240 --> 38:35.520]  That was you.
[38:36.020 --> 38:36.700]  That was your moment.
[38:37.100 --> 38:37.560]  I had it.
[38:37.680 --> 38:40.420]  Yeah, I sure did.
[38:42.280 --> 38:43.440]  Oh, shit.
[38:43.440 --> 38:44.660]  Alright, I have a new game plan.
[38:45.400 --> 38:47.160]  It's kill everyone and hold out.
[38:47.800 --> 38:49.680]  Wow, not using the bomb.
[38:50.040 --> 38:50.500]  Interesting.
[38:53.780 --> 38:54.720]  Godspeed, fellas.
[38:54.720 --> 38:57.460]  Oh, my God.
[38:57.820 --> 38:58.860]  Nick, are you crazy?
[38:59.800 --> 39:00.280]  Oh, yeah.
[39:01.020 --> 39:02.240]  Just have to hold, Eric.
[39:03.160 --> 39:04.600]  Have to wait for reinforcements to arrive.
[39:04.740 --> 39:05.560]  You're a genius.
[39:07.420 --> 39:08.780]  Didn't even consider that.
[39:09.540 --> 39:10.800]  Alright, guys, go ahead and slide under.
[39:10.900 --> 39:12.740]  No, no, no, no, no.
[39:13.300 --> 39:14.140]  Oh, we did it.
[39:18.580 --> 39:18.980]  No!
[39:21.660 --> 39:22.060]  Nick!
[39:23.560 --> 39:25.000]  Your strategy is to hold the line.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.240]  Gavin has to die. Kill him.
[39:26.860 --> 39:27.940]  There goes Geoff.
[39:28.200 --> 39:29.160]  After you, son.
[39:30.040 --> 39:30.520]  No!
[39:33.060 --> 39:33.540]  Alright.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.420]  I thought you were getting pegged
[39:36.420 --> 39:37.880]  by that puck I put down there.
[39:38.620 --> 39:40.000]  Okay, when do I...
[39:41.260 --> 39:41.740]  Now!
[39:42.760 --> 39:44.260]  Oh, you had it.
[39:44.760 --> 39:45.940]  You had it.
[39:48.200 --> 39:49.300]  You made it.
[39:49.300 --> 39:50.580]  Sausage.
[39:51.760 --> 39:53.900]  Three left.
[39:54.580 --> 39:55.020]  Alright.
[39:55.640 --> 39:57.040]  No!
[39:57.920 --> 39:58.900]  Alright.
[40:00.780 --> 40:02.420]  What are you thinking, Geoff?
[40:16.740 --> 40:17.440]  Wow.
[40:18.340 --> 40:18.960]  Whoa.
[40:23.470 --> 40:24.430]  Oh, for...
[40:24.430 --> 40:25.010]  What am I doing?
[40:25.230 --> 40:25.730]  I don't know.
[40:26.210 --> 40:27.370]  You got one second.
[40:32.040 --> 40:32.960]  Fucking hell.
[40:35.280 --> 40:35.760]  No!
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.020]  My shielding!
[40:42.380 --> 40:43.860]  Oh, how did that not hit you?
[40:47.240 --> 40:48.060]  Alright, Andrew.
[40:48.300 --> 40:49.300]  Oh my god.
[40:49.380 --> 40:50.800]  Andrew, you're still in this.
[40:50.800 --> 40:52.920]  Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[40:54.120 --> 40:56.000]  It's slightly out of sync, I think, for us.
[40:56.160 --> 40:58.000]  He's not getting hit on his own screen.
[40:59.740 --> 41:00.420]  Oh, Andrew.
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.440]  My body is getting riddled.
[41:06.520 --> 41:08.040]  Oh, Andrew.
[41:10.020 --> 41:12.020]  Oh my god, he's alive!
[41:12.580 --> 41:12.740]  No!
[41:15.160 --> 41:15.660]  Oh!
[41:18.620 --> 41:19.120]  Blasted.
[41:20.040 --> 41:21.080]  This is it.
[41:21.140 --> 41:23.120]  Nick is still in the lead.
[41:24.440 --> 41:25.120]  No!
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.340]  Oh shit.
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.360]  Oh, did two of us get coins?
[41:28.760 --> 41:30.480]  Oh my god.
[41:38.040 --> 41:38.260]  Wow.
[41:41.540 --> 41:42.220]  Awesome.
[41:42.620 --> 41:44.340]  Oh, that's so lame.
[41:46.700 --> 41:47.380]  Genius.
[41:48.940 --> 41:49.620]  Alright.
[41:49.960 --> 41:50.620]  Just gonna win.
[41:53.180 --> 41:53.660]  No!
[41:54.520 --> 41:55.220]  Oh my god.
[41:58.400 --> 41:58.880]  Yes!
[42:02.800 --> 42:03.280]  Wow.
[42:03.740 --> 42:04.580]  Geoff, what do you got?
[42:05.820 --> 42:06.300]  This.
[42:06.560 --> 42:07.580]  Ah, damn it!
[42:09.820 --> 42:12.240]  When I said this, I was supposed to make it in.
[42:12.720 --> 42:13.920]  Oh my god.
[42:14.060 --> 42:14.680]  Oh my god.
[42:14.700 --> 42:15.660]  She's gonna do it.
[42:18.440 --> 42:20.600]  Oh, I'm getting riddled.
[42:20.600 --> 42:21.600]  No!
[42:21.920 --> 42:23.040]  God damn it.
[42:23.480 --> 42:24.620]  Oh shit.
[42:25.180 --> 42:27.500]  It all comes down to this.
[42:28.740 --> 42:29.780]  Last turn.
[42:30.380 --> 42:31.720]  Nick, you just gotta block him.
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.680]  Oh, I just gotta hold on.
[42:34.680 --> 42:35.900]  Why was there a portal end?
[42:46.230 --> 42:47.110]  Oh wow.
[42:47.950 --> 42:49.270]  Oh my god.
[42:53.970 --> 42:56.730]  Oh, Gavin has an idea.
[42:57.370 --> 42:57.930]  Nick!
[43:02.200 --> 43:03.780]  I stood up in the friendly fire tube.
[43:05.400 --> 43:06.520]  Oh shit.
[43:10.180 --> 43:10.740]  Oh!
[43:12.760 --> 43:14.140]  What's going on with the coin?
[43:14.460 --> 43:15.840]  He swiped it and pulled it down.
[43:16.520 --> 43:16.660]  No!
[43:19.560 --> 43:20.120]  No!
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.040]  It's all on Gavin.
[43:25.460 --> 43:26.960]  He has to die.
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.140]  I knock his fucking block off, Flower.
[43:29.640 --> 43:30.820]  Oh, Gavin.
[43:31.440 --> 43:32.180]  You can do this.
[43:33.600 --> 43:34.120]  No!
[43:38.550 --> 43:40.230]  He's shrooking to hell.
[43:43.010 --> 43:44.050]  Nick wins!
[43:44.630 --> 43:45.990]  Great job, Nick.
[43:46.890 --> 43:49.210]  Wait, is that a tie then?
[43:50.490 --> 43:50.670]  What?
[43:50.930 --> 43:52.030]  Did you win the other game?
[43:52.910 --> 43:53.850]  No, Andrew did.
[43:54.690 --> 43:56.510]  You've won two, Nick and I won one.
[43:57.030 --> 43:57.390]  Sweet.
[43:58.130 --> 44:01.790]  So, I'll back out, so then Eric can replace me and we'll play it again.
[44:01.950 --> 44:04.050]  Well, I think we end this video.
[44:04.390 --> 44:05.030]  Yeah, let's wrap it up.
[44:05.890 --> 44:07.570]  And then go straight into another one?
[44:07.770 --> 44:09.030]  Oh, fuck, yeah, absolutely.
[44:09.390 --> 44:10.130]  That's what I'm saying.
[44:10.330 --> 44:11.770]  We'll switch out the cast and do another video.
[44:12.690 --> 44:17.070]  Let us know in the comments if you want us to play this as many times as we did on Let's Play.
[44:20.550 --> 44:24.090]  If you enjoyed this, please go check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[44:24.910 --> 44:30.290]  Yeah, listen, if you like this, then you'll probably like the podcast, too, because it's like this, but a little bit better.
[44:32.630 --> 44:34.310]  Surprisingly, more deaths on the podcast.
[44:34.650 --> 44:36.030]  You wouldn't have expected that.
[44:36.590 --> 44:38.690]  We have killed more real people on the podcast.
[44:38.950 --> 44:39.410]  That's true.
[44:40.090 --> 44:42.330]  The Achievement Hunter curse is live in Regulation.
[44:43.070 --> 44:44.110]  That's 100% true.
[44:45.230 --> 44:48.550]  Anyway, listen to the podcast, or maybe we'll talk about you someday.
[44:49.990 --> 44:50.430]  Bye!
[44:51.470 --> 44:51.910]  Bye?
