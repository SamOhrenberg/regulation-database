[00:00.000 --> 00:01.900]  That's a squirrel with a gun!
[00:03.880 --> 00:08.160]  Go ahead, Nick. No, you go ahead, Andrew. I was just yelling that it's a squirrel with a gun!
[00:08.320 --> 00:10.880]  It sounded like you had a good intro. I just heard with a gun.
[00:11.640 --> 00:16.240]  Oh, it's the Discord, because I was so excited about it, it didn't pick up. It just cut me off.
[00:16.760 --> 00:21.620]  I was screaming so loud about this squirrel with a goddamn gun. You just screamed squirrel really loud?
[00:22.280 --> 00:23.640]  Uh, I said all of it,
[00:23.740 --> 00:28.940]  but I realized it wasn't picking me up after I said squirrel, so I lowered my volume for the rest of the words.
[00:29.940 --> 00:30.380]  Okay.
[00:32.640 --> 00:37.800]  Have you played this, Andrew? I haven't. It just came out on Xbox. I want to play it.
[00:38.080 --> 00:41.500]  So Nick is playing today. Nick is playing Squirrel with a Gun.
[00:41.700 --> 00:46.600]  He's gonna be like Tom Hanks at the end of Saving Private Ryan.
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.900]  As you can tell by the name burn on screen.
[00:49.240 --> 00:49.280]  Yeah.
[00:50.440 --> 00:57.840]  You don't need a name burn on screen when the title of the stream is Squirrel with a Gun Regulation Stream in Brackets Nick is Playing.
[00:59.080 --> 01:00.560]  It'll still be confusing.
[01:01.000 --> 01:01.200]  It's fine.
[01:02.340 --> 01:04.760]  I'm still confused. Piss Rats!
[01:05.020 --> 01:06.140]  He thinks it's a nut!
[01:06.140 --> 01:09.780]  Thank you Seb for the 10 gifted. The rats are out. We're here.
[01:09.840 --> 01:10.900]  He thinks it's a nut!
[01:11.460 --> 01:12.480]  Go get that nut Nick!
[01:12.980 --> 01:14.160]  Holy shit.
[01:14.460 --> 01:15.720]  This is a rapid squirrel.
[01:16.800 --> 01:18.040]  With a gun!
[01:19.540 --> 01:20.580]  Not yet.
[01:20.860 --> 01:22.200]  It's like the first few levels of Portal.
[01:22.760 --> 01:24.780]  Right now he's Squirrel with Intent.
[01:25.420 --> 01:27.680]  Jesus Christ, this thing is sensitive.
[01:27.680 --> 01:29.360]  He like turns in the air.
[01:29.460 --> 01:30.400]  He's got steering.
[01:31.760 --> 01:33.260]  He's got steering.
[01:33.900 --> 01:35.060]  I feel like I'm watching Ratty Boy.
[01:35.500 --> 01:36.340]  Fuck me!
[01:37.700 --> 01:39.580]  I can't even see on the stream.
[01:39.700 --> 01:40.360]  Is it even playing?
[01:41.820 --> 01:42.180]  I hope so.
[01:43.180 --> 01:44.820]  There's a bunch of those everywhere.
[01:45.020 --> 01:46.240]  You thought it was just the three?
[01:47.140 --> 01:48.340]  They're all over the place.
[01:48.680 --> 01:50.700]  I'm seeing a series of images.
[01:51.860 --> 01:53.520]  It's lagging real hard.
[01:53.800 --> 01:54.420]  Is it really?
[01:54.420 --> 01:54.680]  Really?
[01:56.820 --> 01:58.560]  What have you changed Nick?
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.920]  He got Nitro.
[02:02.580 --> 02:04.860]  You guys might have some bad quality now.
[02:04.940 --> 02:05.300]  Let's see.
[02:05.700 --> 02:06.300]  Is that any better?
[02:07.800 --> 02:10.600]  It looks better on my Discord feed.
[02:11.420 --> 02:13.300]  We're not looking at Discord feed.
[02:13.340 --> 02:13.640]  We're looking at Twitch.
[02:13.840 --> 02:16.480]  Why are you looking at it on Discord and not on Twitch Andrew?
[02:16.820 --> 02:17.620]  I'm looking at both.
[02:18.820 --> 02:21.360]  I don't care about your Discord feed though.
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.420]  Did either improve?
[02:22.420 --> 02:24.920]  I'm just stating what I could report on.
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.140]  This is ridiculous.
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.320]  Here's what I'll do.
[02:27.460 --> 02:29.660]  I'll look at each frame that appears on Twitch.
[02:30.580 --> 02:32.460]  And I'll describe everything that happened in between.
[02:33.340 --> 02:34.580]  He looked around.
[02:34.680 --> 02:35.360]  He jumped off.
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.000]  That does look bad.
[02:39.880 --> 02:41.380]  Why is it doing that?
[02:41.420 --> 02:42.060]  Now it's good.
[02:44.360 --> 02:44.840]  Refresh.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.780]  It's speeding up.
[02:48.180 --> 02:48.960]  Frames came back.
[02:48.960 --> 02:49.520]  Better?
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.140]  I think we're good.
[02:53.000 --> 02:53.700]  There you go.
[02:53.940 --> 02:56.100]  If it's laggy, just refresh.
[02:56.480 --> 02:58.140]  And now we're good.
[02:58.180 --> 02:59.700]  If it's laggy, it's your fault.
[03:01.080 --> 03:01.860]  I'm just kidding.
[03:02.060 --> 03:05.100]  Did you get the fucking acorn thing?
[03:05.580 --> 03:07.240]  No, he has to hit all the buttons first.
[03:07.440 --> 03:08.440]  I got fried on it.
[03:09.380 --> 03:10.760]  I can throw it!
[03:12.700 --> 03:13.620]  Squirrel with debris.
[03:13.780 --> 03:16.540]  I feel like the fucking squirrel from Ice Age.
[03:16.540 --> 03:17.880]  I can't believe it!
[03:21.080 --> 03:23.400]  Is that a no refresh in yours, Nick?
[03:24.660 --> 03:25.980]  It is. It just came out of you.
[03:27.760 --> 03:28.920]  Check this shit.
[03:29.240 --> 03:29.720]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:30.940 --> 03:33.180]  You gotta hit the button, dude.
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.440]  You gotta hit the button.
[03:34.760 --> 03:37.080]  It's like someone looked at Ratsy Boy
[03:37.080 --> 03:38.020]  and made a real game.
[03:38.140 --> 03:39.140]  Like a real one, yeah.
[03:41.840 --> 03:42.980]  So, okay.
[03:43.260 --> 03:44.540]  It was so short!
[03:44.540 --> 03:46.140]  So, watch.
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.440]  Hit the throw button.
[03:47.900 --> 03:49.720]  I saw it. I saw it.
[03:49.840 --> 03:51.600]  To be fair, I was in the air when I did it.
[03:51.680 --> 03:52.300]  Yes, I saw it.
[03:52.920 --> 03:54.600]  I think you can hold it and then you can run.
[03:56.280 --> 03:57.220]  Oh, look at that.
[03:58.800 --> 03:59.160]  Wallop.
[04:00.640 --> 04:01.040]  One more.
[04:03.320 --> 04:03.680]  Nudstrup.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.040]  10 gifted subs.
[04:05.580 --> 04:06.340]  Wow, thank you.
[04:07.500 --> 04:08.420]  There you go.
[04:11.080 --> 04:11.940]  Alright, get the nut.
[04:12.560 --> 04:13.540]  Give me that nut.
[04:13.860 --> 04:16.740]  Thanks for them subs. Let us know if you're on your first trimester.
[04:20.260 --> 04:21.940]  Alright, is it better now, everybody?
[04:22.200 --> 04:22.620]  What's that?
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.960]  The stream. Just making sure it looks good.
[04:26.380 --> 04:27.720]  Looks good, from what I can tell.
[04:32.670 --> 04:34.550]  Got eerily quiet as I did that jump.
[04:34.550 --> 04:35.770]  I wanna see him get the nut!
[04:36.610 --> 04:37.530]  I was watching the stream.
[04:38.470 --> 04:38.930]  Uh-oh.
[04:39.690 --> 04:40.330]  Oh, shit.
[04:42.290 --> 04:43.330]  Music's loud, apparently.
[04:43.330 --> 04:46.510]  This is what happens when you take a condiment from Nixon's.
[04:46.630 --> 04:48.110]  It's just one person saying it over and over.
[04:48.650 --> 04:49.110]  Not usual.
[04:50.010 --> 04:51.230]  Who the hell's that?
[04:52.030 --> 04:52.790]  Oh my god.
[04:52.970 --> 04:53.470]  You better shoot that guy.
[04:58.190 --> 05:00.670]  This is happening very...
[05:00.670 --> 05:01.890]  Is that me without a mustache?
[05:02.790 --> 05:03.210]  Trevor?
[05:04.930 --> 05:05.530]  Trevor!
[05:08.710 --> 05:09.650]  Oh god!
[05:09.810 --> 05:10.450]  What the fuck?
[05:10.870 --> 05:13.910]  Oh no!
[05:13.910 --> 05:14.570]  Oh!
[05:17.650 --> 05:19.230]  The origin story.
[05:19.430 --> 05:20.170]  Oh my god.
[05:22.130 --> 05:25.210]  Dude, these shots are awesome.
[05:25.490 --> 05:26.830]  I love this.
[05:31.630 --> 05:37.070]  They're really capturing what it feels like to see a gun in person for the first time.
[05:40.630 --> 05:41.670]  Fuck yeah.
[05:41.670 --> 05:42.590]  Oh my god.
[05:43.730 --> 05:44.450]  Alright.
[05:44.790 --> 05:45.210]  Okay.
[05:45.570 --> 05:48.370]  Time to do it.
[05:49.490 --> 05:50.850]  Oh my god!
[05:51.450 --> 05:53.630]  Just blow him away!
[05:55.210 --> 05:56.750]  The run with it.
[05:57.610 --> 06:00.390]  The recoil sends you halfway across the room.
[06:01.050 --> 06:01.690]  It sure did.
[06:02.570 --> 06:03.710]  Did it shoot it?
[06:04.430 --> 06:04.810]  Oh, maybe.
[06:05.370 --> 06:07.530]  Shoot the uh...
[06:07.530 --> 06:08.430]  Oh my god!
[06:09.850 --> 06:10.570]  Holy shit.
[06:10.770 --> 06:12.910]  Can you shoot the dead guy in the dick before you leave?
[06:13.450 --> 06:13.950]  Yeah, absolutely.
[06:18.490 --> 06:20.150]  I'll teach him, little son of a bitch.
[06:21.030 --> 06:22.530]  Alright, we reloaded. Let's go.
[06:22.710 --> 06:23.810]  This is so cool.
[06:24.470 --> 06:26.250]  Oh yeah, you gotta get behind cover. It's like GTA.
[06:26.810 --> 06:28.330]  It's a bunch of smiths.
[06:28.890 --> 06:31.070]  Is this the same studio that made Goat Simulator?
[06:31.190 --> 06:31.550]  Is it?
[06:31.930 --> 06:32.790]  It wouldn't surprise me.
[06:33.490 --> 06:35.110]  You better start pulling the trigger, bud.
[06:37.010 --> 06:37.490]  Nice!
[06:38.610 --> 06:38.630]  Yeah!
[06:39.310 --> 06:40.970]  The enemy has been stunned. Now's your chance.
[06:41.370 --> 06:42.410]  Take him down!
[06:43.750 --> 06:45.230]  Go, go, go, go!
[06:46.010 --> 06:46.550]  Get in there!
[06:46.810 --> 06:48.750]  Oh, the takedown's gotten stunned.
[06:49.470 --> 06:49.570]  Oh!
[06:50.790 --> 06:51.270]  Nick!
[06:53.010 --> 06:54.090]  You're out of bullets!
[06:54.710 --> 06:57.110]  Yeah, you can't reload unless you're in one of those spots.
[06:58.130 --> 06:59.510]  It's like Last of Us all over again.
[06:59.950 --> 07:00.350]  Alright.
[07:00.350 --> 07:00.490]  Alright.
[07:04.110 --> 07:04.850]  You know what?
[07:04.950 --> 07:05.870]  I realized the problem was.
[07:05.950 --> 07:08.550]  I wasn't having an Oktoberfest beer yesterday while I was doing it.
[07:08.710 --> 07:09.130]  Oh!
[07:09.590 --> 07:11.650]  That must be it.
[07:12.270 --> 07:13.710]  And that's what I'm doing now.
[07:13.710 --> 07:14.810]  You just killed that guy.
[07:15.550 --> 07:17.910]  Try to get a takedown. Try to go for the body again.
[07:19.530 --> 07:20.450]  Thanks, ToastGhost27.
[07:20.710 --> 07:21.430]  Get him!
[07:22.710 --> 07:24.330]  Almost a trimester for you.
[07:25.030 --> 07:25.470]  Ow!
[07:27.470 --> 07:27.930]  Jesus!
[07:27.930 --> 07:30.830]  In the face!
[07:31.890 --> 07:33.250]  They dropped acorns!
[07:33.430 --> 07:35.930]  Oh my god. This is awesome!
[07:36.450 --> 07:37.490]  Winter's coming, bitch!
[07:38.290 --> 07:40.150]  You can shove him around as well.
[07:41.090 --> 07:41.790]  Oh, we can?
[07:41.970 --> 07:44.230]  So you can just push a guy across the room by his...
[07:44.230 --> 07:44.770]  Asshole.
[07:45.130 --> 07:45.410]  Nice!
[07:47.870 --> 07:48.730]  He'll be cover.
[07:49.850 --> 07:50.950]  Can I get him through the door?
[07:51.190 --> 07:51.950]  No, it's like Hitman.
[07:53.570 --> 07:54.050]  Oh!
[07:54.050 --> 07:54.430]  Oh!
[07:54.850 --> 07:56.630]  I can double jump with the gun!
[07:57.030 --> 07:58.390]  That's great!
[07:58.950 --> 08:01.130]  So does that mean if you're out of ammo you just fall?
[08:02.330 --> 08:03.310]  I assume so, yeah.
[08:04.070 --> 08:04.790]  That's a pretty big jump.
[08:04.790 --> 08:05.490]  Yeah, I guess you would.
[08:06.470 --> 08:06.870]  Interesting.
[08:09.870 --> 08:11.550]  Oh, ok.
[08:11.750 --> 08:12.670]  Alright, let's see.
[08:14.990 --> 08:15.570]  How did I do?
[08:15.670 --> 08:16.650]  Oh, a secret thing.
[08:16.930 --> 08:17.510]  A gear!
[08:18.770 --> 08:20.870]  The wedge adds max reload energy.
[08:20.870 --> 08:23.070]  Hold B to reload any gun.
[08:23.170 --> 08:23.590]  Cool.
[08:25.610 --> 08:26.450]  Wrong version!
[08:27.070 --> 08:28.210]  With a full trimester!
[08:28.430 --> 08:29.070]  Thanks for the sub.
[08:29.230 --> 08:30.850]  Got the prime sub going. Nice.
[08:32.310 --> 08:33.430]  Thank you so much.
[08:34.390 --> 08:36.910]  This is great. We're live every Friday
[08:36.910 --> 08:39.610]  at 4pm Central Time
[08:39.610 --> 08:40.810]  right here on Twitch.
[08:41.030 --> 08:41.990]  Oh wow, that was sick.
[08:42.790 --> 08:44.590]  And then you can watch this VOD on Tuesday.
[08:44.870 --> 08:47.050]  So you can see Squirrel with a Gun later for yourself.
[08:47.770 --> 08:48.190]  Yeah!
[08:48.190 --> 08:50.430]  If you keep shooting Nick,
[08:50.510 --> 08:52.210]  do you just keep going up in the air with your jump?
[08:52.350 --> 08:53.310]  Or is it just one jump?
[08:54.670 --> 08:55.490]  Hell yeah!
[08:57.250 --> 08:57.810]  Big juggle!
[08:58.790 --> 09:00.130]  We have discovered
[09:00.130 --> 09:01.690]  something important, gentlemen.
[09:02.630 --> 09:03.070]  Wee!
[09:03.970 --> 09:04.650]  Rainbow jump.
[09:05.870 --> 09:06.230]  Oh.
[09:08.490 --> 09:09.970]  Interesting way to go about that.
[09:10.090 --> 09:12.190]  Yeah, that was a choice.
[09:14.390 --> 09:15.070]  Nick is choosing.
[09:16.190 --> 09:16.670]  There you go.
[09:17.710 --> 09:18.150]  Oh.
[09:18.410 --> 09:21.270]  What is that?
[09:24.310 --> 09:25.190]  Another acorn.
[09:25.610 --> 09:26.570]  I don't think shooting is going to do it.
[09:26.610 --> 09:27.570]  I think you have to go collect it.
[09:28.610 --> 09:30.470]  Okay, I didn't see that platform initially.
[09:30.630 --> 09:31.030]  There we go.
[09:31.990 --> 09:34.610]  This is a pre-record
[09:34.610 --> 09:35.910]  from last Tuesday.
[09:36.630 --> 09:37.350]  You didn't see this?
[09:38.290 --> 09:40.730]  This is like the second time we're playing.
[09:40.730 --> 09:41.950]  Give me the nut! Yeah!
[09:42.190 --> 09:43.450]  You should see what happens
[09:43.450 --> 09:45.270]  You should see what happens in about 20 minutes.
[09:45.410 --> 09:47.570]  Stay tuned for the next half hour.
[09:47.770 --> 09:49.370]  Stay locked in, stay engaged.
[09:50.270 --> 09:51.510]  And that will be the way
[09:51.510 --> 09:51.950]  that you know.
[09:53.350 --> 09:54.970]  You put a lot of pressure on us.
[09:56.850 --> 09:57.650]  I disagree.
[09:58.510 --> 09:59.250]  Okay, fair enough.
[10:01.510 --> 10:02.310]  Okay, so...
[10:02.770 --> 10:03.790]  Look at that level 9
[10:03.790 --> 10:04.370]  hype train go.
[10:07.530 --> 10:08.790]  Do you run into those?
[10:10.210 --> 10:11.470]  What, these things? Oh yeah, you're right.
[10:11.470 --> 10:11.830]  Good call.
[10:13.630 --> 10:14.150]  Wee!
[10:15.350 --> 10:17.230]  I didn't see them. You're fine.
[10:18.470 --> 10:18.990]  Oh!
[10:19.790 --> 10:20.510]  It's a gun swap.
[10:21.390 --> 10:22.130]  Take both.
[10:24.150 --> 10:25.190]  Take both?
[10:25.850 --> 10:26.690]  Yeah, come on man.
[10:27.070 --> 10:27.470]  Dual wield.
[10:29.190 --> 10:31.170]  Did you see another one of those little dots?
[10:31.270 --> 10:33.030]  Get those tiny little squirrel hands.
[10:33.150 --> 10:34.750]  Where? On the wall?
[10:36.230 --> 10:36.750]  There you go.
[10:37.550 --> 10:38.030]  You can shoot it.
[10:40.030 --> 10:40.430]  Yeah!
[10:40.910 --> 10:42.070]  Alright, here we go.
[10:44.510 --> 10:45.270]  That's gonna do it.
[10:46.690 --> 10:48.010]  Yeah, I thought about it
[10:48.010 --> 10:48.650]  as I was shooting.
[10:49.590 --> 10:51.090]  That's a difficult puzzle.
[10:51.670 --> 10:53.370]  For a squirrel?
[10:53.690 --> 10:54.910]  This is a tough puzzle for a squirrel.
[10:54.990 --> 10:56.450]  I don't think my dog could figure that out.
[10:58.270 --> 10:59.730]  Dog with a gun? Boring.
[11:00.350 --> 11:01.230]  Squirrel with a gun? Cool.
[11:01.830 --> 11:03.890]  If you put a gun in a cage of
[11:03.890 --> 11:05.970]  10 squirrels, do you think they'd pull
[11:05.970 --> 11:06.870]  the trigger same day?
[11:08.350 --> 11:08.790]  What?
[11:09.050 --> 11:12.210]  You can climb a pole by jumping on it, but you must be unarmed.
[11:12.370 --> 11:13.050]  It's gotta be longer.
[11:13.390 --> 11:14.130]  I think it would be longer.
[11:14.910 --> 11:17.850]  So, it matters if you're
[11:17.850 --> 11:18.530]  armed or not.
[11:19.630 --> 11:20.070]  Interesting.
[11:21.010 --> 11:22.050]  I'm getting those nuts.
[11:22.950 --> 11:24.010]  You're going nuts alright.
[11:26.710 --> 11:28.210]  I'm trying to figure out...
[11:28.210 --> 11:29.830]  You climb this, you make the arrows
[11:29.830 --> 11:31.270]  point to the other...
[11:31.270 --> 11:32.410]  Yeah, I did that.
[11:33.410 --> 11:34.690]  But I just want to see
[11:34.690 --> 11:36.390]  if I hit my head,
[11:36.490 --> 11:37.470]  if it fucks with this.
[11:38.410 --> 11:38.870]  Okay.
[11:40.430 --> 11:41.290]  That's close.
[11:42.090 --> 11:43.390]  It's really close.
[11:43.870 --> 11:45.730]  Maybe the option here is just to...
[11:45.730 --> 11:47.370]  No, I think the option is to jump from the platform.
[11:47.450 --> 11:50.170]  You just go to that and then across.
[11:50.430 --> 11:51.890]  There you go.
[11:57.530 --> 11:58.390]  Can't see.
[11:59.190 --> 12:00.010]  Can't see.
[12:00.010 --> 12:01.890]  Move the camera.
[12:02.390 --> 12:03.290]  I did!
[12:12.090 --> 12:13.550]  I did it.
[12:13.630 --> 12:14.850]  Was he like this yesterday?
[12:15.730 --> 12:17.790]  What are you talking about?
[12:18.050 --> 12:19.090]  He's been like this.
[12:19.890 --> 12:21.330]  What are you on about?
[12:22.650 --> 12:24.030]  It's fucking hard
[12:24.030 --> 12:24.670]  to control.
[12:24.990 --> 12:27.530]  This is a really unwieldy camera.
[12:27.530 --> 12:29.670]  Turn down the sensitivity a little bit.
[12:32.770 --> 12:35.250]  See if you can turn up the graphics to even better.
[12:36.750 --> 12:38.350]  Does that feel less unwieldy?
[12:38.790 --> 12:39.990]  No, it just feels weird.
[12:43.010 --> 12:45.530]  I didn't think it was the camera that was unwieldy.
[12:45.630 --> 12:47.310]  It's more his spinning movement.
[12:47.770 --> 12:47.970]  Uh-huh.
[12:48.430 --> 12:49.290]  I like to spin.
[12:49.910 --> 12:52.010]  The camera is fine though, isn't it?
[12:53.210 --> 12:55.750]  Gun plus A plus A plus A.
[12:55.890 --> 12:57.390]  So get that gun and go back.
[12:57.390 --> 12:58.910]  Go back to the top.
[13:00.550 --> 13:02.210]  It wouldn't pick it up at first.
[13:02.730 --> 13:05.490]  Can I go back
[13:05.490 --> 13:06.430]  and climb with this?
[13:06.770 --> 13:08.230]  Why would you climb? You have a gun.
[13:08.670 --> 13:09.630]  Ah, the gun.
[13:11.210 --> 13:12.590]  Gavin, help.
[13:16.210 --> 13:17.390]  You got this, Nick.
[13:18.830 --> 13:19.770]  There you go.
[13:20.730 --> 13:21.850]  There we go.
[13:21.970 --> 13:24.170]  Now we're going across.
[13:24.930 --> 13:26.290]  Go, go, go, go.
[13:26.850 --> 13:27.250]  Yeah.
[13:28.590 --> 13:30.110]  Where else does it want you to go?
[13:30.350 --> 13:31.010]  Back this way?
[13:34.330 --> 13:36.350]  Because I don't know if it's taking you anywhere.
[13:37.430 --> 13:39.530]  I thought it was going to be a gear or something.
[13:40.330 --> 13:41.930]  Is there anything over here?
[13:42.930 --> 13:44.510]  I mean, might as well finish the path.
[13:44.850 --> 13:45.890]  Yeah, let's go look.
[13:48.490 --> 13:49.410]  Can you shoot that?
[13:50.730 --> 13:52.410]  Yeah, let's get as far away from it as possible.
[13:52.410 --> 13:53.430]  No, you're going to recoil back.
[13:54.550 --> 13:56.930]  I don't have enough bullets to do anything here.
[13:57.070 --> 13:58.510]  So it's either shoot that
[13:58.510 --> 13:59.530]  or not at all.
[14:00.630 --> 14:01.430]  Time out.
[14:01.710 --> 14:03.610]  Nick, you're going to do it, it's going to work,
[14:03.690 --> 14:06.030]  but you're going to die is the scenario that you're setting up.
[14:09.370 --> 14:11.270]  Did you even get it? Did you hit it?
[14:11.670 --> 14:13.630]  Guys, who could have seen that coming?
[14:15.450 --> 14:17.130]  Thanks, Sib, for the gifted subs.
[14:17.310 --> 14:19.190]  It's the only thing keeping me going right now.
[14:19.290 --> 14:20.050]  I appreciate it.
[14:22.410 --> 14:23.710]  No, no, no.
[14:23.730 --> 14:24.850]  You gotta go back.
[14:25.010 --> 14:26.510]  You went 80.
[14:27.550 --> 14:29.570]  You gotta try shooting that thing properly.
[14:30.130 --> 14:30.810]  Shoot it at a distance.
[14:32.050 --> 14:32.450]  Yeah.
[14:35.950 --> 14:37.970]  It could be a bang pipe.
[14:38.650 --> 14:39.490]  It probably is.
[14:39.610 --> 14:41.430]  You probably have to shoot it on the
[14:41.430 --> 14:42.750]  little target piece.
[14:46.830 --> 14:47.390]  What?
[14:47.510 --> 14:49.450]  What is so goddamn funny?
[14:49.450 --> 14:51.810]  You were juggling on that one.
[14:51.910 --> 14:52.570]  It wasn't your fault.
[14:52.690 --> 14:54.270]  You were really juggling on it.
[14:56.290 --> 14:56.770]  Alright.
[14:57.070 --> 14:58.190]  Let's take a look here.
[15:00.590 --> 15:01.070]  Nothing?
[15:01.610 --> 15:02.010]  Nothing.
[15:02.650 --> 15:03.590]  Can you climb it?
[15:05.770 --> 15:06.410]  Let's try.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.720]  Oh, I can do the reload thing then.
[15:12.300 --> 15:13.220]  Nope, no climb.
[15:13.440 --> 15:13.720]  Nothing?
[15:14.440 --> 15:16.540]  I just don't know why it would bring you over here.
[15:17.100 --> 15:17.800]  I don't either.
[15:21.080 --> 15:21.600]  Wee!
[15:21.600 --> 15:22.660]  That has to be something.
[15:23.060 --> 15:24.740]  Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's nothing.
[15:24.980 --> 15:27.160]  Thanks, Flergens. Appreciate you.
[15:28.400 --> 15:28.620]  Eh.
[15:31.340 --> 15:31.860]  Flergens.
[15:33.680 --> 15:34.580]  Oh, shit!
[15:35.760 --> 15:36.560]  He died again.
[15:37.100 --> 15:38.420]  Last words were Flergens.
[15:39.500 --> 15:40.020]  Flergens.
[15:40.420 --> 15:42.340]  He died the way he lived. Flergens.
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.200]  Flergens. Alright, let's see.
[15:45.320 --> 15:46.260]  Alright, okay, alright.
[15:46.260 --> 15:46.360]  Alright.
[15:47.500 --> 15:48.220]  New one.
[15:50.140 --> 15:51.220]  And here we go.
[15:51.480 --> 15:54.720]  If Flerging was a verb, what do you think it would be?
[15:54.980 --> 15:55.680]  Oh, that's good.
[15:55.760 --> 15:57.460]  I would say it would be gifting subs.
[16:02.240 --> 16:04.400]  We got some Flergens in here, what's up?
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.900]  Let's see if anyone Flergs later on.
[16:08.660 --> 16:09.900]  Yo, where my Flergs at?
[16:10.500 --> 16:13.220]  I've heard there's gonna be massive amounts of Flergens today.
[16:15.180 --> 16:15.460]  Flergens.
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.120]  Flergens is a...
[16:17.120 --> 16:19.180]  Let's say a Swedish
[16:19.180 --> 16:20.340]  fish dish.
[16:20.960 --> 16:22.420]  That I have never heard of.
[16:23.020 --> 16:23.880]  Just give it to me.
[16:24.440 --> 16:25.040]  It's pretty good.
[16:25.660 --> 16:27.960]  Dude, it's like the hippos in Donkey Kong 64.
[16:28.220 --> 16:29.500]  Yeah, seriously.
[16:29.960 --> 16:30.520]  Yeah!
[16:32.540 --> 16:34.360]  Flergens himself is Flergens.
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.220]  Awesome, we're Flerging in here.
[16:36.560 --> 16:37.640]  Shoot fast, fly high.
[16:40.500 --> 16:41.060]  So...
[16:41.060 --> 16:42.940]  Where do we want to take this?
[16:46.280 --> 16:46.760]  Do you see
[16:46.760 --> 16:48.740]  the announcement of the Analog 3D?
[16:49.140 --> 16:49.200]  Gavin?
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.020]  Analog 3D?
[16:52.460 --> 16:53.760]  What's an Analog 3D?
[16:54.240 --> 16:56.260]  The company that makes
[16:56.260 --> 16:58.240]  the HD Nintendo consoles.
[16:59.380 --> 17:01.080]  Like the really realistic ones.
[17:01.220 --> 17:02.340]  Like the SNES and the
[17:03.260 --> 17:03.940]  N64.
[17:04.700 --> 17:05.140]  It's coming out.
[17:05.360 --> 17:06.580]  Oh, really? Cool.
[17:07.080 --> 17:09.180]  Dude, Nick, you wasted those guys.
[17:10.380 --> 17:10.820]  Whoa!
[17:11.640 --> 17:13.740]  How many money holes is it?
[17:13.840 --> 17:14.920]  It's like $230.
[17:15.780 --> 17:16.220]  Oh.
[17:16.980 --> 17:19.000]  That's not crazy, right?
[17:19.180 --> 17:21.480]  No, especially for the other stuff they've made.
[17:22.040 --> 17:23.100]  I think their
[17:23.100 --> 17:24.820]  original NES is like $500.
[17:25.460 --> 17:25.880]  Oh, wow.
[17:26.680 --> 17:28.940]  How do I...
[17:28.940 --> 17:31.300]  I think you gotta take a little bit of a leap
[17:31.300 --> 17:33.140]  of faith and try to double jump
[17:33.140 --> 17:33.900]  when you're a little bit closer.
[17:34.920 --> 17:35.600]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[17:37.080 --> 17:37.440]  Yeah!
[17:39.300 --> 17:39.660]  Dude,
[17:39.700 --> 17:40.680]  this might be the game of the year.
[17:40.980 --> 17:43.580]  I'm gonna have to buy this.
[17:45.180 --> 17:45.700]  Oh, yeah.
[17:46.140 --> 17:46.940]  How much was this, Nick?
[17:47.820 --> 17:48.180]  $20.
[17:49.780 --> 17:50.500]  Not bad.
[17:52.060 --> 17:53.180]  I've paid more for less.
[17:54.560 --> 17:55.760]  Did they make the analog
[17:55.760 --> 17:57.700]  pocket thing that I bought? The Game Boy one?
[17:59.480 --> 17:59.720]  Yeah.
[18:00.540 --> 18:01.600]  Yeah, that thing's
[18:02.740 --> 18:03.100]  great.
[18:03.640 --> 18:04.100]  What?
[18:07.020 --> 18:08.640]  I think you gotta try to make that jump.
[18:10.120 --> 18:11.000]  I can't tell
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.480]  if you said that weird or if you don't like it.
[18:13.560 --> 18:14.600]  No, I love it.
[18:14.700 --> 18:16.820]  I guess you could try this.
[18:17.340 --> 18:18.340]  I could try the gun across.
[18:19.760 --> 18:21.180]  Let's do it.
[18:21.760 --> 18:22.220]  Go!
[18:22.720 --> 18:24.360]  Go! Come on!
[18:24.640 --> 18:25.660]  Come on!
[18:26.920 --> 18:27.380]  Nick!
[18:28.500 --> 18:30.860]  When you get close, throw the gun, grab the pole.
[18:30.860 --> 18:32.260]  I need to...
[18:32.260 --> 18:34.600]  Throw is right bumper, right?
[18:34.760 --> 18:35.280]  Yeah, correct.
[18:35.840 --> 18:38.160]  I can't believe you ignored the pipe and went for the ledge.
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.860]  The pipe was hard...
[18:41.480 --> 18:42.740]  Oh, are you talking about the further pipe
[18:42.740 --> 18:43.680]  that he just didn't grab?
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.360]  Uh-oh!
[18:46.180 --> 18:46.740]  Get him!
[18:47.180 --> 18:47.800]  Blow him away!
[18:50.340 --> 18:51.300]  Get those nuts!
[18:52.200 --> 18:52.640]  Reload!
[18:53.800 --> 18:54.960]  Do it up his mouth!
[18:55.420 --> 18:55.860]  Yeah!
[18:55.860 --> 18:56.480]  Go!
[18:57.560 --> 18:57.920]  Oh!
[18:58.660 --> 19:00.440]  They have different finishers for different guns?
[19:02.600 --> 19:03.860]  Oh, he's got him in the face!
[19:03.980 --> 19:04.900]  Oh my god!
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.320]  What? There wasn't three guys last time!
[19:08.320 --> 19:09.620]  I think that's what happened last time.
[19:09.700 --> 19:10.740]  The third guy didn't spawn.
[19:12.260 --> 19:13.260]  20 bucks, huh?
[19:13.760 --> 19:14.800]  Could you toss him in the lava?
[19:15.980 --> 19:16.280]  Ooh!
[19:18.880 --> 19:20.080]  Get rid of the evidence!
[19:20.860 --> 19:21.700]  Hide the bodies.
[19:22.120 --> 19:23.560]  No one can know a squirrel did this.
[19:24.900 --> 19:25.260]  Oh!
[19:26.480 --> 19:26.840]  Nice!
[19:27.480 --> 19:27.900]  Hell yeah.
[19:29.280 --> 19:32.320]  It'd be so funny if this was like Hitman where you could dress in their clothes.
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.000]  He just shrinks them.
[19:35.440 --> 19:37.440]  I think you just tossed your gun in lava, didn't you?
[19:37.740 --> 19:38.820]  Yeah, he just got rid of the gun.
[19:39.460 --> 19:41.020]  He's getting rid of all the evidence.
[19:41.180 --> 19:43.040]  Yeah, he doesn't want anyone to know about this.
[19:43.380 --> 19:44.660]  It's gonna smell so good in here.
[19:46.100 --> 19:46.940]  Well, to be...
[19:46.940 --> 19:48.960]  Can I use this to get up, do you think?
[19:49.720 --> 19:51.100]  Or do I have to climb this bit?
[19:51.100 --> 19:52.940]  I mean, you can probably just use it to get up.
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.580]  There you go.
[19:55.980 --> 19:57.700]  My instinct is gun first.
[19:58.200 --> 19:59.020]  Oh, absolutely.
[20:01.180 --> 20:01.900]  Eye patch!
[20:02.260 --> 20:03.180]  Hang on!
[20:05.920 --> 20:06.840]  Oh, yeah!
[20:08.220 --> 20:09.140]  This rocks.
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.780]  Oh, he's got a little beret.
[20:11.160 --> 20:12.240]  He has a little beret.
[20:12.540 --> 20:14.200]  Oh, this is awesome.
[20:15.960 --> 20:17.500]  Okay, we're not gonna make that, though.
[20:17.580 --> 20:18.420]  No, no, no, you gotta climb.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.020]  Oh, he's got a little eye patch.
[20:20.100 --> 20:21.100]  I have to buy this.
[20:22.700 --> 20:23.920]  This is awesome.
[20:24.420 --> 20:25.800]  How much buns is this game?
[20:26.140 --> 20:26.580]  20.
[20:27.020 --> 20:27.740]  20 bucks.
[20:28.020 --> 20:30.700]  Oh, this is interesting.
[20:33.560 --> 20:34.000]  So...
[20:34.000 --> 20:34.560]  20?
[20:36.060 --> 20:38.800]  I would pay so much money to watch Nick play Portal.
[20:39.420 --> 20:40.600]  Like, an actual puzzle.
[20:40.740 --> 20:41.580]  Portal's easier.
[20:42.580 --> 20:43.860]  But I mean, like, I'm trying to...
[20:43.860 --> 20:46.100]  So they have the gun, the reloads over there.
[20:46.100 --> 20:47.840]  But I don't see a gun anywhere.
[20:47.960 --> 20:48.840]  Well, I mean, you had a gun.
[20:49.800 --> 20:50.040]  Yeah.
[20:50.740 --> 20:53.020]  So you could shoot your way to there.
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.240]  You could get up on that ledge.
[20:55.580 --> 20:56.460]  That ledge there.
[20:56.700 --> 20:58.500]  And then just fire your way up.
[20:59.460 --> 21:00.440]  Alright, we'll go get the gun, then.
[21:00.760 --> 21:03.680]  You were trying to use the gun to get all the way up this pipe, but you could just land.
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.200]  No, I was trying to get on that roof.
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.860]  You're trying to get on that roof? You could do that.
[21:09.160 --> 21:09.480]  Ow.
[21:09.940 --> 21:10.440]  Fall damage.
[21:11.700 --> 21:13.440]  Alright, let's find out. I tried last time.
[21:13.440 --> 21:14.460]  Try again.
[21:15.260 --> 21:16.640]  How do you know if you tried last time?
[21:17.320 --> 21:18.560]  Because I faced it the other way.
[21:18.620 --> 21:19.600]  I guess I was.
[21:20.040 --> 21:23.200]  Gavin, it's useless. It's useless to argue.
[21:23.880 --> 21:24.460]  I just don't know.
[21:24.840 --> 21:27.240]  Hey, is there a tutorial for this?
[21:27.460 --> 21:27.620]  No.
[21:28.440 --> 21:31.720]  Well, I don't...
[21:31.720 --> 21:32.900]  I'll look right now.
[21:33.540 --> 21:34.660]  Just say I don't know.
[21:36.280 --> 21:37.440]  All the way...
[21:38.540 --> 21:39.260]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[21:39.300 --> 21:40.900]  Sometimes you get weird about I don't knows.
[21:41.880 --> 21:43.780]  You're like, you should know.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.760]  Yeah, he's like, oh, you should know.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.140]  Oh, hey, I agree with that.
[21:48.160 --> 21:48.780]  You should.
[21:49.240 --> 21:50.020]  You're putting the pressure on.
[21:50.020 --> 21:54.220]  I think I was busy exporting things this afternoon.
[21:54.520 --> 21:54.960]  There you go.
[21:55.740 --> 21:56.460]  Say that.
[21:58.080 --> 21:58.800]  That just...
[21:58.800 --> 22:00.960]  Oh, hey, I actually didn't get a chance to look.
[22:01.020 --> 22:02.120]  I was busy exporting stuff.
[22:02.460 --> 22:02.820]  Oh, okay.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.840]  It looks like you could go the other way as well.
[22:07.340 --> 22:08.480]  Oh, there's the acorn.
[22:08.480 --> 22:09.520]  There's the one you're missing.
[22:10.060 --> 22:11.580]  Tricky little bastard acorn.
[22:11.800 --> 22:12.720]  And I dropped the gun.
[22:14.600 --> 22:15.900]  It's just right there, isn't it?
[22:17.700 --> 22:18.020]  Where?
[22:18.540 --> 22:19.400]  Did you drop it up there?
[22:19.940 --> 22:22.300]  I thought he dropped it up there, but I guess it's all the way down here.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.720]  It must have tinged all the way down.
[22:24.260 --> 22:25.320]  Yeah, it tinged.
[22:28.660 --> 22:30.720]  I wonder how many guns there are in this game.
[22:31.120 --> 22:32.080]  There have...
[22:32.080 --> 22:35.380]  If we found two already, there have to be so many.
[22:36.380 --> 22:37.800]  I want to see...
[22:37.800 --> 22:39.240]  I want to see him with a sniper rifle.
[22:39.540 --> 22:40.520]  I want to see that.
[22:40.680 --> 22:43.620]  I want to see the recoil just shoot him in the eye.
[22:43.700 --> 22:45.160]  A big, like, bull-action
[22:45.160 --> 22:46.400]  leap off the level height.
[22:46.880 --> 22:47.360]  Absolutely.
[22:47.840 --> 22:51.200]  He second-guessed himself.
[22:51.440 --> 22:51.920]  Absolutely.
[22:52.500 --> 22:54.360]  He second-guessed himself, then he panicked.
[22:54.780 --> 22:54.940]  Yep.
[22:56.560 --> 22:59.040]  If you're not here on Thursday afternoons
[22:59.040 --> 23:01.120]  to watch Nick play The Last of Us 2
[23:01.120 --> 23:02.940]  and you aren't familiar with the way
[23:04.500 --> 23:05.220]  he rethinks
[23:05.220 --> 23:07.080]  his situation while he's in the middle of it
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.700]  to panic and fall apart,
[23:09.060 --> 23:09.960]  welcome to the stream.
[23:11.120 --> 23:12.260]  What's a platformer?
[23:12.960 --> 23:15.160]  Well, the thing is, is Nick gets it done.
[23:15.300 --> 23:17.060]  Like, he does get to the end. He does make progress.
[23:17.340 --> 23:18.640]  He does! Absolutely. But he'll make moves,
[23:18.820 --> 23:21.020]  and we're all like, none of us
[23:21.020 --> 23:21.600]  would have done that.
[23:22.820 --> 23:24.780]  Well, yeah. You gotta make your own path.
[23:25.160 --> 23:26.420]  Okay, so now...
[23:26.420 --> 23:28.880]  So it's right above me. That's why we couldn't see it from here, fellas.
[23:29.260 --> 23:30.800]  Exactly. That's why we didn't know.
[23:30.800 --> 23:31.600]  Yeah, no.
[23:31.800 --> 23:33.060]  But then I threw the gun away.
[23:34.420 --> 23:36.500]  But also, over there, I didn't have any...
[23:36.500 --> 23:38.520]  Look, there's no bullet refill, so I wouldn't have been able to make the jump.
[23:38.540 --> 23:41.100]  Why isn't he just getting the fucking A-coin?
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.920]  Because I'm telling you
[23:42.920 --> 23:44.460]  what the fuck is up, son!
[23:44.540 --> 23:46.820]  Why did he do that all the way to the top and then to walk
[23:46.820 --> 23:48.420]  to the edge to be like, see?
[23:49.300 --> 23:51.080]  Well, because you, uh...
[23:51.080 --> 23:51.600]  you don't listen.
[23:54.460 --> 23:55.680]  He's going all the way to the bottom.
[23:57.740 --> 23:58.460]  He's going all the way to the bottom.
[23:58.460 --> 23:58.760]  Yeah.
[24:02.540 --> 24:04.340]  He's just living his squirrel life.
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.600]  He's having...
[24:05.600 --> 24:06.940]  Okay, well, he's not living.
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.540]  I have some new thoughts.
[24:08.900 --> 24:11.120]  Nick, we should play co-op Portal 2 together.
[24:11.620 --> 24:13.780]  Oh, I want to watch that so bad.
[24:14.040 --> 24:14.440]  Please.
[24:14.980 --> 24:16.000]  Let's do it.
[24:18.100 --> 24:19.060]  I assure you...
[24:19.060 --> 24:21.480]  Here's the thing. Nick isn't bad at video games.
[24:21.680 --> 24:22.260]  Not at all.
[24:22.280 --> 24:23.900]  I would never look at this and be like, oh, Nick is bad at games.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.500]  Nick is not bad at video games.
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.740]  The decision-making is so new.
[24:28.740 --> 24:31.080]  He's not in, like, my wheelhouse
[24:31.080 --> 24:32.920]  at all, where it's just like...
[24:32.920 --> 24:34.460]  Nick, what a save!
[24:36.260 --> 24:38.420]  Nick, you also might play differently
[24:38.420 --> 24:39.700]  if no one's watching.
[24:41.360 --> 24:43.000]  Oh, I'll be watching.
[24:43.460 --> 24:44.540]  We need to...
[24:45.260 --> 24:46.880]  I gotta watch him play
[24:46.880 --> 24:48.600]  Portal 2. I can't watch the video
[24:48.600 --> 24:49.020]  later.
[24:49.860 --> 24:51.920]  So I have to go up this thing now.
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.320]  Okay.
[24:54.180 --> 24:54.960]  That is the move.
[24:58.800 --> 25:00.960]  This is Nick's Ratatouille.
[25:07.440 --> 25:09.380]  Dude, this game is awesome.
[25:09.920 --> 25:12.100]  Need another sip of that Oktoberfest.
[25:12.720 --> 25:14.140]  Maybe it's you drinking
[25:14.140 --> 25:15.720]  is the problem. Are you on the badge?
[25:16.540 --> 25:17.760]  I am right now.
[25:18.100 --> 25:20.080]  I'm having one. Do you need to pee or anything?
[25:20.900 --> 25:21.600]  No. Okay.
[25:22.560 --> 25:23.580]  I don't have a Clamato.
[25:29.330 --> 25:31.030]  A little acorn hat and eye patch.
[25:31.030 --> 25:31.930]  Huh?
[25:33.810 --> 25:34.970]  What is this?
[25:35.130 --> 25:35.670]  It's an alien.
[25:36.710 --> 25:37.430]  Oh!
[25:38.770 --> 25:39.770]  It's a little car.
[25:40.910 --> 25:42.470]  It's so bad.
[25:43.010 --> 25:45.030]  Dude, you gotta feed that acorn machine.
[25:45.910 --> 25:46.870]  Four hundred
[25:46.870 --> 25:48.490]  and twelve gold?
[25:48.870 --> 25:49.770]  Oh my god.
[25:50.270 --> 25:51.930]  At first I was hoping it'd be one or the other.
[25:52.990 --> 25:53.530]  Wow.
[25:54.270 --> 25:54.910]  Oh.
[25:56.190 --> 25:57.210]  What the hell?
[25:57.210 --> 25:59.610]  Oh, it's making me save.
[25:59.770 --> 26:00.850]  Somebody in the chat said,
[26:01.050 --> 26:02.610]  is his beret an acorn top?
[26:03.650 --> 26:03.890]  Yeah.
[26:04.850 --> 26:06.590]  I thought it was just a beret.
[26:06.750 --> 26:08.570]  I didn't know it was a little acorn top.
[26:09.830 --> 26:10.610]  Oh my god.
[26:10.690 --> 26:12.190]  This is Ratatouille now, isn't it?
[26:14.490 --> 26:15.090]  It's like
[26:15.090 --> 26:16.590]  it watched you play The Last of Us.
[26:17.410 --> 26:18.750]  I don't like games where you can
[26:18.750 --> 26:20.150]  clearly fit through the gap.
[26:20.990 --> 26:21.430]  What?
[26:22.890 --> 26:24.630]  The floor is lava, kids.
[26:31.840 --> 26:32.300]  Oh, I
[26:32.300 --> 26:33.200]  landed in the windowsill.
[26:34.680 --> 26:35.720]  Knock it all over.
[26:36.400 --> 26:36.960]  Destroy it.
[26:37.340 --> 26:37.960]  That one didn't move.
[26:39.960 --> 26:40.820]  That one did not move.
[26:43.600 --> 26:44.220]  It didn't
[26:44.220 --> 26:44.660]  move, Eric.
[26:45.200 --> 26:46.380]  Oh, I know. I saw it.
[26:47.640 --> 26:48.400]  It didn't move.
[26:50.020 --> 26:50.740]  I tried to push it.
[26:52.180 --> 26:52.920]  Alright, here we go.
[26:53.320 --> 26:54.240]  Did you try to push it?
[26:55.620 --> 26:56.860]  Andrew, I don't know if you saw it. It didn't move.
[26:56.860 --> 26:57.480]  Ah.
[26:59.940 --> 27:01.000]  I thought he just
[27:01.000 --> 27:01.840]  didn't try to push it.
[27:03.380 --> 27:04.400]  No double jump.
[27:05.180 --> 27:06.660]  I didn't double jump.
[27:07.200 --> 27:08.840]  I was really impressed with that
[27:08.840 --> 27:10.640]  first jump. I was like, wow, he really just
[27:10.640 --> 27:11.980]  jumped at that. He leapt.
[27:15.480 --> 27:16.980]  I'm almost tempted not to get these
[27:16.980 --> 27:18.960]  in case I die again. I would say
[27:18.960 --> 27:20.460]  if you die again, don't get them next time.
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.820]  Okay. This is the spicy
[27:22.820 --> 27:25.000]  house. And there's three acorns
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.200]  in here. Whoa.
[27:28.780 --> 27:30.680]  Two outfits, I'm guessing? Two outfits.
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.320]  Oh my gosh.
[27:32.860 --> 27:35.020]  Oh, you're on the thing. Squirrel with an outfit.
[27:36.820 --> 27:37.440]  Nice, Nick.
[27:37.680 --> 27:38.140]  God, Nick.
[27:38.440 --> 27:39.280]  That was narrow.
[27:44.360 --> 27:46.560]  You need to weakest link this thing
[27:46.560 --> 27:48.600]  and go bank those acorns as soon
[27:48.600 --> 27:50.720]  as you get out of this house. Oh, there it is.
[27:50.780 --> 27:51.780]  Oh, wait. What was that?
[27:52.600 --> 27:53.620]  It's a six? Oh, that thing?
[27:53.980 --> 27:55.100]  Oh, what is this for?
[27:55.200 --> 27:57.220]  It's a sweater?
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.480]  Oh, did you spend all your acorns
[27:59.480 --> 28:01.800]  on that instead of the car?
[28:01.860 --> 28:03.660]  No, no, no. It was just telling me what was going on.
[28:04.240 --> 28:05.620]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Back right corner.
[28:05.980 --> 28:08.020]  Yeah, there's a thing that you can spend your...
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.220]  No. To your left.
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.140]  That thing's 50.
[28:11.660 --> 28:12.980]  Yeah, but what is it? I saw it already.
[28:13.460 --> 28:14.300]  Oh, it's a gun.
[28:16.180 --> 28:17.480]  Okay, so now...
[28:17.480 --> 28:18.540]  So, now what?
[28:19.200 --> 28:21.380]  Now we shoot. We're gonna shoot those things.
[28:21.380 --> 28:22.740]  Yeah, that thing's 50.
[28:23.520 --> 28:24.920]  Yeah, and it seems like you need it.
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.140]  Yeah, but it looked like it was gold.
[28:30.660 --> 28:31.220]  Alright, so...
[28:31.860 --> 28:35.340]  Oh, I was really hoping
[28:35.340 --> 28:37.340]  you would bounce on the bed. Yeah, me too.
[28:38.080 --> 28:38.900]  Yeah, that would have been cool.
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.200]  Can you blow out a window and just leave? Oh, there you go.
[28:41.840 --> 28:43.380]  Why leave? You gotta shoot those...
[28:44.400 --> 28:45.540]  Whoa, cool. Why would you leave?
[28:45.580 --> 28:46.560]  I can blow out a window. Yeah.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.200]  Yeah, we gotta go by the thing.
[28:49.200 --> 28:50.900]  Oh, I just saw those.
[28:53.460 --> 28:54.700]  Eric's gonna bust a nut.
[28:55.320 --> 28:56.120]  What? I didn't see them.
[28:56.480 --> 28:59.240]  I just turned around. No, you didn't just
[28:59.240 --> 29:01.460]  turn around. Okay, well I didn't see them.
[29:02.240 --> 29:02.980]  I know.
[29:04.340 --> 29:05.260]  Two more? Yeah, I know.
[29:06.940 --> 29:08.620]  Hey, you play games the way you wanna play.
[29:09.200 --> 29:11.380]  Yeah, absolutely. There you go.
[29:12.440 --> 29:13.320]  Yeah, I did it.
[29:13.420 --> 29:15.060]  Dropping all these beds. Alright, what are we doing here?
[29:15.520 --> 29:16.700]  You just... Okay.
[29:16.700 --> 29:17.640]  Should we? No, I didn't.
[29:18.160 --> 29:19.580]  Do we wanna save it?
[29:20.020 --> 29:22.420]  Do you wanna save it for the car? Let's see it.
[29:23.960 --> 29:24.320]  Okay.
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.840]  Well, it's just to unlock it.
[29:28.900 --> 29:30.740]  I was worried that if we actually opened it, it would take
[29:30.740 --> 29:32.060]  too long. Oh, yeah.
[29:32.680 --> 29:34.720]  This game's awesome. I gotta...
[29:34.720 --> 29:35.500]  I have to get this.
[29:36.820 --> 29:38.120]  And then Nick has to watch you play.
[29:39.800 --> 29:40.160]  Yeah.
[29:43.100 --> 29:44.340]  So where's the last one?
[29:44.340 --> 29:46.300]  Probably in the lower level,
[29:46.420 --> 29:46.860]  I would assume.
[29:48.500 --> 29:50.180]  Wait, wait, wait.
[29:50.380 --> 29:51.140]  Oh, I didn't.
[29:51.260 --> 29:54.580]  But it might be out a window
[29:54.580 --> 29:56.100]  on a sill.
[29:56.640 --> 29:57.700]  You know what I mean?
[29:58.020 --> 29:58.780]  That's fair.
[30:00.580 --> 30:02.240]  I didn't mean to do that.
[30:02.560 --> 30:02.760]  Sill.
[30:03.920 --> 30:05.020]  So you're on the sill.
[30:06.180 --> 30:08.240]  Let's swing the camera around.
[30:08.500 --> 30:09.200]  Oh, yeah.
[30:09.860 --> 30:10.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:11.060 --> 30:12.720]  I got that
[30:12.720 --> 30:13.840]  squirrel brain, you know?
[30:15.400 --> 30:16.900]  Oh, I don't have anything
[30:16.900 --> 30:18.700]  to reload. No, just go back to the
[30:18.700 --> 30:20.300]  gun that you bought.
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.920]  They give you all the mechanics.
[30:26.680 --> 30:28.800]  What do you mean? Yeah, I was looking for a reload
[30:28.800 --> 30:30.720]  station. I forgot that you could actually just grab another gun.
[30:31.920 --> 30:32.720]  You probably want to shoot
[30:32.720 --> 30:34.820]  that. It's fallen in the lava.
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.040]  There you go.
[30:36.440 --> 30:37.300]  I thought about it.
[30:38.400 --> 30:39.200]  There we are.
[30:39.460 --> 30:40.020]  Oh, he's moved.
[30:41.520 --> 30:42.620]  What do you think?
[30:42.840 --> 30:43.300]  Ah, fuck.
[30:45.500 --> 30:46.980]  Right in the middle of...
[30:46.980 --> 30:47.880]  Oh, no!
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.680]  You killed him with the thing.
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.660]  You gotta reload.
[30:54.440 --> 30:54.880]  Reload?
[30:55.200 --> 30:56.400]  Gotta get back in that house.
[30:56.740 --> 30:57.660]  Yeah, we'll get back in the house.
[30:58.740 --> 31:00.820]  It also said that you can hide in the bushes, I think.
[31:02.300 --> 31:02.520]  Nah.
[31:05.850 --> 31:07.050]  Let's hop across again.
[31:08.170 --> 31:08.750]  You know what?
[31:10.010 --> 31:11.110]  Oh, it doesn't let me save.
[31:12.690 --> 31:13.150]  Yeah, what
[31:13.150 --> 31:14.370]  do you think it is? The Last of Us 2?
[31:15.550 --> 31:17.050]  Well, to be fair, we found out
[31:17.050 --> 31:19.130]  that it doesn't always take you back to where you save.
[31:20.130 --> 31:20.770]  Oh, it does?
[31:21.290 --> 31:22.290]  Goddammit, it didn't jump.
[31:22.830 --> 31:25.170]  Is that something that happened yesterday
[31:25.170 --> 31:26.630]  where you saved and it didn't...
[31:26.630 --> 31:29.130]  Yeah, it's just like a checkpoint save. It's not like a quick save.
[31:29.170 --> 31:30.370]  Oh, it's a fake save. I got it.
[31:31.190 --> 31:32.130]  Alright, we're leaving those.
[31:34.830 --> 31:35.890]  You still got
[31:35.890 --> 31:37.410]  an outfit to get in here as well.
[31:37.590 --> 31:41.050]  Oh, good notice, Gavin.
[31:41.930 --> 31:43.190]  Completely forgot about the outfit.
[31:43.810 --> 31:45.150]  I can't forget about the outfit.
[31:47.090 --> 31:48.010]  Oh, okay.
[31:48.250 --> 31:48.870]  So are those back?
[31:50.630 --> 31:51.290]  Those are.
[31:51.490 --> 31:51.950]  I guess so.
[31:52.610 --> 31:55.150]  So can you just chuck yourself in lava and keep getting those?
[31:55.750 --> 31:56.770]  They might not
[31:58.030 --> 31:59.050]  be part of your total.
[31:59.230 --> 31:59.990]  Oh, no, I guess they are.
[32:00.570 --> 32:01.390]  I'm not sure.
[32:01.530 --> 32:03.950]  Okay, so it stays the same
[32:03.950 --> 32:05.110]  from the last time you did it.
[32:05.210 --> 32:05.790]  That's interesting.
[32:07.990 --> 32:09.390]  And up. And over.
[32:09.790 --> 32:10.370]  And up.
[32:11.170 --> 32:13.250]  Have you ever played Mr. Nuts on Super Nintendo?
[32:13.850 --> 32:15.030]  No. What's that?
[32:15.750 --> 32:16.510]  It's a squirrel game.
[32:17.130 --> 32:19.790]  No, I should have guessed.
[32:20.310 --> 32:21.690]  A draft squirrel game?
[32:21.830 --> 32:22.930]  Oh, Mr. Nuts? Hell yeah.
[32:25.410 --> 32:26.950]  Is it awesome awesome count?
[32:28.350 --> 32:29.210]  What the hell is that?
[32:29.210 --> 32:29.450]  Bubsy count?
[32:31.690 --> 32:32.570]  You got it.
[32:32.630 --> 32:33.570]  What do you think the outfit is?
[32:35.430 --> 32:35.910]  Uh...
[32:35.910 --> 32:37.390]  Look around.
[32:38.190 --> 32:39.670]  What the fuck is Bubsy?
[32:40.170 --> 32:42.690]  Mark Sally said Mr. Nuts rules.
[32:43.130 --> 32:44.510]  It was on Game Boy Advance.
[32:45.450 --> 32:45.570]  Weird.
[32:46.730 --> 32:48.430]  You could play it on your analog pocket.
[32:49.030 --> 32:49.370]  I could.
[32:50.330 --> 32:52.110]  You got to be able...
[32:52.110 --> 32:54.870]  It's got to be in one of these windows
[32:54.870 --> 32:57.070]  in a different way, I would think.
[32:58.070 --> 32:59.030]  You're shitting me.
[32:59.110 --> 33:00.230]  It was on Game Boy Advance.
[33:00.630 --> 33:01.730]  Holy shit.
[33:03.210 --> 33:04.930]  Oh, maybe down. Oh, there we go.
[33:05.190 --> 33:06.310]  Oh, jeez.
[33:06.470 --> 33:06.590]  Oh.
[33:10.910 --> 33:12.830]  So you got it when you actually pay for it.
[33:13.870 --> 33:14.750]  Inside. Brown.
[33:15.570 --> 33:16.170]  Oh, what's this?
[33:17.590 --> 33:19.650]  I am a fancy squirrel.
[33:19.650 --> 33:19.950]  Okay.
[33:23.610 --> 33:24.850]  I love mixed characters.
[33:25.330 --> 33:26.490]  Two businesses.
[33:29.090 --> 33:30.030]  You're welcome.
[33:31.330 --> 33:32.930]  Honestly, couldn't do it without you.
[33:34.910 --> 33:36.530]  Yeah, we've established that.
[33:37.590 --> 33:39.990]  Well, we all said that we were...
[33:39.990 --> 33:41.170]  this could continue without us.
[33:41.170 --> 33:43.350]  Except Andrew, who said it can continue without you.
[33:45.250 --> 33:46.350]  Oh, that's interesting.
[33:46.350 --> 33:48.590]  Holy shitball soup.
[33:49.030 --> 33:50.590]  Mr. Nuts on Super Nintendo
[33:50.590 --> 33:51.850]  is $170.
[33:52.550 --> 33:53.030]  Oh, yeah.
[33:54.070 --> 33:57.010]  People who collect this stuff are like crazy mode, dude.
[33:57.150 --> 33:57.950]  They're like nuts.
[33:58.730 --> 33:59.930]  Oh, Mr. Nuts.
[34:00.070 --> 34:02.730]  I can't believe I sold mine when I was eight.
[34:03.930 --> 34:04.990]  They're Mr. Nuts.
[34:05.170 --> 34:05.950]  They're literally...
[34:05.950 --> 34:08.410]  Mr. Nuts has all the copies of Mr. Nuts.
[34:08.650 --> 34:09.650]  He's just like, I'm gonna...
[34:10.450 --> 34:12.310]  Nice. Way to go, Nick.
[34:12.470 --> 34:13.550]  Get that gear.
[34:13.550 --> 34:15.410]  So, what does the gear do?
[34:15.510 --> 34:16.270]  It just makes you reload?
[34:16.530 --> 34:18.610]  It lets you reload without having to stop.
[34:18.630 --> 34:19.390]  It's like a bunch of bullets.
[34:19.630 --> 34:19.950]  Oh.
[34:22.850 --> 34:26.330]  So, on Mean Streets,
[34:26.470 --> 34:27.410]  there are two
[34:27.410 --> 34:28.770]  bullet things,
[34:29.110 --> 34:30.790]  two acorns, and two outfits.
[34:31.750 --> 34:33.010]  Damn streets is mean.
[34:33.650 --> 34:37.750]  Alright, I'd like to get off of that.
[34:38.610 --> 34:39.550]  Oh, there we go.
[34:39.650 --> 34:40.430]  Then you just climb down.
[34:40.430 --> 34:42.030]  I'm falling off.
[34:42.350 --> 34:44.130]  Then you just gotta move the camera and then climb down.
[34:44.270 --> 34:44.750]  So, you got it.
[34:45.710 --> 34:47.390]  Oh, those guys are dead.
[34:47.890 --> 34:49.450]  Yeah, you wasted them, bud.
[34:49.770 --> 34:51.910]  I mean, I knew the one died. How'd the second one die?
[34:52.530 --> 34:53.410]  You dropped the roof on him.
[34:53.810 --> 34:54.790]  Oh, again? Sweet.
[34:56.130 --> 34:57.530]  There's my gun. Let's go get it.
[34:57.730 --> 34:58.730]  Can you pick up that brick?
[34:59.690 --> 35:00.750]  There's a brick? Let's go back.
[35:00.850 --> 35:01.970]  It's not called Scroll the Brick.
[35:03.630 --> 35:05.150]  What type of game do you think this is?
[35:06.590 --> 35:08.830]  The brick on the street that you just ran over.
[35:08.830 --> 35:10.550]  No, behind you.
[35:11.110 --> 35:12.850]  Oh, that thing.
[35:17.470 --> 35:18.510]  Scroll the Brick.
[35:18.770 --> 35:19.630]  Scroll the Brick.
[35:21.330 --> 35:22.290]  He looks cool, too.
[35:22.650 --> 35:23.970]  You throw it through their window?
[35:24.430 --> 35:25.310]  Do some vandalism.
[35:27.950 --> 35:28.930]  Let's have a look.
[35:29.790 --> 35:29.890]  Hey.
[35:31.590 --> 35:32.090]  Yeah!
[35:32.710 --> 35:33.230]  Yeah!
[35:34.750 --> 35:36.710]  Alright, where should we go?
[35:37.350 --> 35:38.450]  Just start looking around.
[35:38.670 --> 35:40.510]  Yeah, I think just any...
[35:40.510 --> 35:41.630]  Can you hold that guy up?
[35:42.630 --> 35:43.770]  That's just a man.
[35:44.310 --> 35:45.110]  Wait, wait, wait.
[35:45.950 --> 35:46.890]  Drop the nuts!
[35:48.610 --> 35:50.030]  He dropped them on the back.
[35:50.230 --> 35:51.610]  I didn't shoot him that time.
[35:51.850 --> 35:55.230]  I think if you don't shoot him, and you just hold your gun to him,
[35:55.350 --> 35:56.530]  like with L...
[35:56.530 --> 35:57.610]  Yeah, I think you can rob him.
[35:58.450 --> 35:58.990]  Drop it!
[36:01.450 --> 36:02.610]  I think he's out.
[36:02.770 --> 36:04.010]  I think you've robbed him entirely.
[36:04.010 --> 36:04.890]  Where are you?
[36:05.310 --> 36:07.650]  Hey, you little son of a bitch.
[36:08.630 --> 36:08.830]  You!
[36:10.690 --> 36:11.550]  Give him one.
[36:11.810 --> 36:12.830]  And then hold him up.
[36:15.130 --> 36:15.650]  Abendigo!
[36:16.490 --> 36:17.430]  10 gifted subs.
[36:17.670 --> 36:18.410]  Thank you very much.
[36:18.510 --> 36:19.490]  Thank you so much.
[36:21.430 --> 36:22.210]  Drop it!
[36:25.350 --> 36:25.770]  Alright.
[36:26.910 --> 36:27.750]  Another agent.
[36:28.570 --> 36:29.110]  Alright, let's move.
[36:29.390 --> 36:30.890]  Let's go to the yellow house.
[36:30.890 --> 36:31.670]  Okay.
[36:33.770 --> 36:35.910]  He's just a squirrel with a gun.
[36:36.210 --> 36:37.550]  Like, it just really is this.
[36:39.810 --> 36:41.650]  Well, they were being pretty honest, I suppose.
[36:42.570 --> 36:45.190]  Like, this makes more sense than goat game, or whatever.
[36:45.410 --> 36:45.450]  Yeah.
[36:45.750 --> 36:46.550]  Oh, it's locked?
[36:47.130 --> 36:47.690]  Through the window!
[36:48.410 --> 36:48.710]  Yeah.
[36:51.450 --> 36:51.930]  It's...
[36:52.590 --> 36:53.070]  Crazy.
[36:53.230 --> 36:53.390]  What?
[36:53.710 --> 36:54.030]  Nothing.
[36:54.030 --> 36:55.270]  What are you talking about?
[36:58.230 --> 36:59.030]  Squirrel with a plant?
[37:02.270 --> 37:02.810]  What's that?
[37:05.210 --> 37:05.570]  Uh...
[37:05.570 --> 37:06.330]  Be sneaky!
[37:08.430 --> 37:09.150]  Oh shit!
[37:09.350 --> 37:10.430]  Squirrel with a weight!
[37:10.710 --> 37:11.810]  Wait, wait, wait!
[37:13.670 --> 37:14.450]  Don't throw it at him!
[37:14.990 --> 37:16.630]  Throw it at the agent.
[37:17.630 --> 37:19.550]  Yeah, see if you can hit him right in the old cranium.
[37:20.470 --> 37:20.630]  Okay.
[37:21.470 --> 37:23.050]  Jump up on the table.
[37:23.070 --> 37:24.850]  Alright, he's gonna see you.
[37:24.850 --> 37:25.510]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[37:27.150 --> 37:28.310]  There you go.
[37:28.870 --> 37:30.470]  You gotta move the camera a little bit.
[37:30.670 --> 37:30.930]  There you go.
[37:33.110 --> 37:33.570]  Oh!
[37:33.910 --> 37:35.350]  Get on top of him!
[37:36.130 --> 37:37.330]  Let me do something.
[37:38.670 --> 37:39.830]  Grab the weight!
[37:41.210 --> 37:42.530]  Finish him with the weight!
[37:43.550 --> 37:44.530]  Oh my god!
[37:44.650 --> 37:45.370]  Oh my god!
[37:45.530 --> 37:46.550]  His eyes out!
[37:46.550 --> 37:47.710]  His eyes out!
[37:48.330 --> 37:49.690]  Oh my god, he's feral!
[37:50.130 --> 37:51.330]  He bit his face!
[37:52.870 --> 37:53.210]  Oh!
[37:53.870 --> 37:54.270]  Wow!
[37:57.950 --> 37:58.750]  Can you...
[37:58.750 --> 38:00.550]  Go back, drop this real quick.
[38:01.010 --> 38:03.030]  Go back to the guy that was standing in the corner.
[38:03.590 --> 38:04.810]  Can you, like, jump on him?
[38:04.850 --> 38:06.610]  Or, like, control him Ratatouille style or something?
[38:09.230 --> 38:10.030]  Hell yeah!
[38:10.770 --> 38:11.430]  Wait, what?
[38:11.530 --> 38:12.590]  Did I just break his neck?
[38:13.870 --> 38:14.710]  What happened?
[38:14.850 --> 38:15.930]  Did you just finish him?
[38:19.890 --> 38:20.330]  Hey, buddy.
[38:20.990 --> 38:21.650]  Oh, he got you!
[38:22.590 --> 38:23.670]  There you go.
[38:24.130 --> 38:25.530]  Oh, he's a chiropractor!
[38:26.570 --> 38:27.710]  You cracked him!
[38:27.830 --> 38:29.210]  We cracked him up!
[38:30.190 --> 38:32.050]  I just noticed that he was, like, glowy purple.
[38:32.190 --> 38:33.730]  So, I thought you could, like, do something to him.
[38:35.750 --> 38:38.210]  Thanks to the night slash one for the ten gifted subs.
[38:38.730 --> 38:39.770]  Thank you so much!
[38:39.770 --> 38:41.510]  This game is awesome.
[38:44.070 --> 38:44.870]  It's just...
[38:44.870 --> 38:47.270]  Simple premise video game is so fun.
[38:47.570 --> 38:49.590]  Like, remember, we've been talking about, like,
[38:49.790 --> 38:51.890]  what a chore it is to, like, play games,
[38:51.950 --> 38:53.350]  get games going, all that stuff.
[38:53.630 --> 38:55.630]  This is just a simple premise game that is, like,
[38:55.730 --> 38:57.090]  it's just a blast.
[38:58.090 --> 38:58.730]  Oh, wow!
[38:59.450 --> 39:00.050]  That was...
[39:01.330 --> 39:02.410]  Wait again, buddy.
[39:04.290 --> 39:05.350]  That was amazing.
[39:05.550 --> 39:06.030]  Oh, finish him!
[39:06.030 --> 39:07.350]  Yeah, finish him up!
[39:07.750 --> 39:07.990]  No!
[39:10.870 --> 39:11.870]  I'm so curious
[39:11.870 --> 39:14.190]  if you can use the weight as part of your finisher.
[39:14.670 --> 39:16.030]  As, like, if it's different
[39:16.030 --> 39:17.070]  with, like, a brick and stuff.
[39:17.390 --> 39:18.490]  Oh, yeah.
[39:19.130 --> 39:20.810]  Instead of just dropping it next time.
[39:21.490 --> 39:22.710]  Next time I'll hang on to it.
[39:28.150 --> 39:30.230]  Well, there's a lot of shit in here.
[39:30.410 --> 39:31.210]  Yeah, but...
[39:31.830 --> 39:33.450]  Oh, what's this?
[39:34.350 --> 39:35.170]  Is that a grenade?
[39:35.810 --> 39:36.750]  Let's find out.
[39:36.970 --> 39:38.330]  Is it a thermonuclear device?
[39:38.590 --> 39:40.170]  Please don't throw it at the glass.
[39:40.310 --> 39:40.910]  Oh, my God.
[39:42.110 --> 39:44.230]  I just dropped it.
[39:44.330 --> 39:47.270]  Yeah, well, get up on the fridge first
[39:47.270 --> 39:48.210]  when you get a second.
[39:49.550 --> 39:51.530]  I don't think I can get up there without a gun.
[39:51.650 --> 39:52.250]  Oh, maybe I can.
[39:52.930 --> 39:53.770]  Nope, I can't.
[39:54.590 --> 39:55.870]  I was pretty sure.
[39:56.170 --> 39:57.070]  Jump from the window sill.
[39:57.450 --> 39:58.230]  Jump from the wine bottle.
[39:58.230 --> 39:58.310]  Oh.
[40:00.350 --> 40:01.790]  Get in the window.
[40:03.110 --> 40:03.670]  Nice!
[40:05.070 --> 40:05.870]  Okay, nice.
[40:07.290 --> 40:07.650]  Hey.
[40:08.090 --> 40:08.730]  Move out of the way, prick.
[40:11.050 --> 40:12.630]  He chewed his face off.
[40:18.690 --> 40:19.810]  Okay, nice.
[40:20.270 --> 40:21.710]  Now you gotta find those guys again.
[40:23.130 --> 40:23.750]  There you go.
[40:23.750 --> 40:24.670]  There you go.
[40:27.330 --> 40:28.550]  I'll wait for him to come back.
[40:28.770 --> 40:29.530]  Oh, that'll work.
[40:30.570 --> 40:32.010]  Oh, my God.
[40:33.430 --> 40:34.990]  Oh, my God.
[40:35.750 --> 40:37.370]  He didn't hit the ground again.
[40:37.790 --> 40:38.610]  That was awesome.
[40:38.810 --> 40:39.890]  This is the best game in the world.
[40:40.170 --> 40:41.830]  This is so fun.
[40:41.910 --> 40:42.890]  Is he not dead?
[40:43.850 --> 40:45.150]  That's some horse shit.
[40:45.470 --> 40:47.770]  Oh, it might be.
[40:49.430 --> 40:51.170]  I think you gotta get out of here, man.
[40:51.530 --> 40:52.390]  Yeah, I think so.
[40:52.510 --> 40:53.350]  Oh, there's a thing under there.
[40:53.450 --> 40:56.730]  Okay, I'm gonna go get the gun that I dropped.
[40:58.230 --> 40:58.690]  Uh-oh.
[40:58.930 --> 41:00.330]  Andrew, how would you rate that trellis?
[41:01.590 --> 41:01.910]  Oh.
[41:03.270 --> 41:06.050]  It'd take at least, I'd say, six and a half months to do.
[41:06.190 --> 41:06.430]  Uh-oh.
[41:09.270 --> 41:10.990]  Oh, he's gonna shoot that guy in the head.
[41:11.050 --> 41:11.730]  You'll kill this dude.
[41:11.750 --> 41:12.730]  You're gonna get this guy killed.
[41:14.930 --> 41:16.330]  Oh, my God, what have I done?
[41:16.390 --> 41:17.050]  Did they kill him?
[41:17.890 --> 41:18.610]  You killed him.
[41:18.630 --> 41:19.710]  You snapped his neck.
[41:21.530 --> 41:23.110]  He was but an innocent man.
[41:23.330 --> 41:24.970]  He didn't need a chiropractic adjustment.
[41:25.350 --> 41:25.410]  Whoa!
[41:26.690 --> 41:27.290]  Kill him!
[41:29.250 --> 41:30.210]  Oh, my God.
[41:30.690 --> 41:32.530]  Oh, my God, I killed that man.
[41:33.070 --> 41:34.570]  You just wrecked necks now.
[41:35.510 --> 41:36.550]  Well, now you know you can do that.
[41:36.610 --> 41:37.750]  Go break the other guy's neck.
[41:38.530 --> 41:39.770]  Oh, yeah, you're right. Let's go get him.
[41:40.470 --> 41:41.410]  Where did I drop the gun?
[41:41.650 --> 41:44.390]  Well, you don't have to. Go spend and get one. It's right there to your right.
[41:50.520 --> 41:50.920]  Hello.
[41:52.000 --> 41:52.600]  What's up?
[41:56.300 --> 41:57.280]  It's so graphic.
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.680]  It's crazy.
[41:59.020 --> 42:01.020]  Yeah, there's like a spending post thing
[42:01.020 --> 42:02.120]  right here that's...
[42:02.120 --> 42:03.480]  Over here?
[42:04.320 --> 42:05.520]  I think it's to the right.
[42:07.660 --> 42:08.800]  Oh, is that a save?
[42:10.520 --> 42:11.300]  What are y'all doing?
[42:11.400 --> 42:12.400]  Are they gonna kick you or something?
[42:12.580 --> 42:14.360]  I don't know. Don't forget to save. You gotta save.
[42:14.480 --> 42:15.240]  Oh, they like you.
[42:15.240 --> 42:16.280]  They're trying to...
[42:16.280 --> 42:17.080]  They think it's fun.
[42:18.340 --> 42:20.320]  No, no, I think you gotta jump on it.
[42:20.780 --> 42:21.620]  Oh, just jump into it?
[42:21.680 --> 42:23.840]  RT. It says right trigger.
[42:24.420 --> 42:25.320]  I know, I know, I saw it.
[42:26.420 --> 42:28.500]  You're on this guy's arm instead of the nuts.
[42:29.760 --> 42:31.060]  Get out of the goddamn way!
[42:32.720 --> 42:34.560]  Can you climb in someone's butt?
[42:35.060 --> 42:36.380]  There you go. Oh, that's awesome.
[42:37.080 --> 42:38.840]  Is that really the same game screen?
[42:38.840 --> 42:39.200]  Ah!
[42:42.360 --> 42:43.600]  This is great.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.340]  Oh man, that's really fun.
[42:46.380 --> 42:48.060]  Oh, I jumped a bunch of nuts!
[42:49.360 --> 42:49.540]  Hey.
[42:51.520 --> 42:52.200]  Excuse me.
[42:52.800 --> 42:53.820]  What are you doing?
[42:54.280 --> 42:55.180]  I'm trying to climb on their butt.
[42:57.000 --> 42:58.960]  See, there's a gun thing over there across the street.
[42:59.360 --> 42:59.520]  Hello?
[43:01.020 --> 43:02.120]  Press Y to go.
[43:02.340 --> 43:03.600]  You got fucking freaked, Squirrel.
[43:05.880 --> 43:07.220]  Is that a gun?
[43:07.220 --> 43:08.320]  Yeah, it's a gun.
[43:10.800 --> 43:11.460]  Nice.
[43:12.420 --> 43:13.640]  What a great game show.
[43:14.040 --> 43:15.160]  Is that a gun?
[43:16.180 --> 43:16.780]  Waste him.
[43:20.320 --> 43:21.240]  Finish him.
[43:21.880 --> 43:22.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:23.640 --> 43:24.020]  Woohoo!
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.520]  Oh my god, it's so cool.
[43:26.940 --> 43:28.640]  It doesn't stop being cool.
[43:38.210 --> 43:38.730]  Awesome.
[43:38.730 --> 43:39.950]  Finish him!
[43:40.770 --> 43:41.690]  Finish him!
[43:42.310 --> 43:44.650]  In the body of his friend!
[43:49.150 --> 43:50.750]  I used your friend
[43:50.750 --> 43:52.370]  for cover, then I killed you.
[43:54.330 --> 43:56.850]  So you don't have unlimited reloads
[43:56.850 --> 43:58.650]  or you do? How does the reloading work?
[43:59.110 --> 44:00.570]  I have at least
[44:00.570 --> 44:01.790]  one currently.
[44:02.310 --> 44:03.410]  You should try to shoot her.
[44:03.870 --> 44:06.010]  Oh, so that is bullets.
[44:06.010 --> 44:07.710]  Okay, when you get those things, it's bullets.
[44:08.830 --> 44:10.150]  Oh yeah, I'll shoot her when she comes back.
[44:10.150 --> 44:11.450]  No, let's go back to the yellow house.
[44:11.730 --> 44:14.030]  Because there's one more thing you have to
[44:14.030 --> 44:15.490]  Oh, it's the nuts on the roof.
[44:16.630 --> 44:16.970]  Oh.
[44:17.910 --> 44:18.510]  Oh, okay.
[44:21.070 --> 44:22.090]  But also, if you go around
[44:22.090 --> 44:23.790]  the front, I guess this side,
[44:24.190 --> 44:25.830]  there's that red, there's a red
[44:26.270 --> 44:27.390]  You see that red right there?
[44:27.750 --> 44:28.630]  Can you shoot that?
[44:29.930 --> 44:31.830]  Or do you need the grenade to blow it up?
[44:32.710 --> 44:34.450]  It could be a grenade, yeah.
[44:35.230 --> 44:35.870]  Oh wait, look.
[44:36.230 --> 44:36.990]  If we don't do anything.
[44:38.410 --> 44:39.130]  Well hold on, I'm thinking.
[44:40.130 --> 44:40.610]  Because look.
[44:41.970 --> 44:43.810]  Top hat. Inside top hat?
[44:44.110 --> 44:46.030]  Oh, the Apollo Creed style hat?
[44:46.050 --> 44:47.010]  Oh my god.
[44:48.150 --> 44:49.670]  You're about to get killed by Drago.
[44:50.190 --> 44:51.510]  Yeah, this is awesome. Ooh, a cake.
[44:52.710 --> 44:53.450]  Can I do anything?
[44:54.110 --> 44:56.390]  Alright, let's try shooting it then.
[44:57.190 --> 44:58.390]  I don't think it'll do.
[44:59.370 --> 45:01.070]  I think it's a grenade.
[45:01.210 --> 45:02.890]  I think you gotta use that grenade.
[45:04.590 --> 45:05.610]  You just accidentally
[45:05.610 --> 45:07.390]  got a... Nick is just a
[45:07.390 --> 45:08.390]  happenstance guy.
[45:13.590 --> 45:13.950]  Alright.
[45:14.210 --> 45:15.850]  Let's go in here, go get the grenade.
[45:16.070 --> 45:18.130]  Well, if it's still there. If it's still there, yeah.
[45:19.130 --> 45:19.990]  Is it in the sink?
[45:20.990 --> 45:21.610]  Oh no.
[45:22.350 --> 45:24.010]  That's the end. That's alright, we'll figure it out.
[45:25.210 --> 45:25.410]  Aha!
[45:26.430 --> 45:27.370]  Oh, can you get him in the bog?
[45:27.550 --> 45:30.170]  Oh, cool!
[45:31.050 --> 45:32.110]  Sweet, that worked out.
[45:32.170 --> 45:33.690]  Ooh, there's a body under here.
[45:33.790 --> 45:34.470]  What the fuck?
[45:34.730 --> 45:37.070]  Did I do that?
[45:38.170 --> 45:38.970]  Oh no.
[45:39.390 --> 45:40.170]  Two grenades or something?
[45:42.370 --> 45:43.590]  Oh yeah, looks like it.
[45:44.090 --> 45:44.550]  Oh, cool.
[45:45.130 --> 45:47.310]  Alright, so we'll drop this for now. Take the grenade.
[45:48.050 --> 45:49.270]  Yeah, we gotta figure out where exactly.
[45:49.470 --> 45:51.110]  Okay, so...
[45:52.730 --> 45:54.230]  Maybe you have to go up
[45:54.230 --> 45:56.010]  through the toilet again?
[45:56.250 --> 45:56.650]  Maybe.
[45:56.650 --> 45:58.610]  Unless there's another way to go.
[45:58.950 --> 46:01.190]  I think you can just walk there and that's the way out.
[46:01.730 --> 46:02.150]  Oh, really?
[46:03.030 --> 46:04.030]  Oh, he might be out.
[46:04.850 --> 46:06.770]  Yeah, there's one. And then you need the other one.
[46:08.130 --> 46:08.570]  Oh, yeah.
[46:09.310 --> 46:09.530]  Go back.
[46:09.910 --> 46:11.510]  Well, there's another grenade where you're going.
[46:12.230 --> 46:14.350]  Yeah, I was just making sure it was on the...
[46:14.350 --> 46:15.850]  See, look, it's closed off there.
[46:16.010 --> 46:18.150]  So I wasn't sure if it would actually lead to it or not.
[46:18.730 --> 46:19.210]  But it might.
[46:20.990 --> 46:21.730]  There we go.
[46:22.410 --> 46:22.770]  Nice!
[46:22.770 --> 46:23.750]  Okay, so we...
[46:23.750 --> 46:24.710]  No, I need to go back for the other one.
[46:25.510 --> 46:27.330]  But also, how do you get to that?
[46:29.330 --> 46:29.650]  Uh...
[46:29.650 --> 46:32.350]  I didn't see a red thing to blow up, did you?
[46:34.590 --> 46:35.470]  I did not.
[46:36.230 --> 46:37.650]  Maybe it's just a different way in the maze.
[46:38.130 --> 46:38.570]  Could be.
[46:41.070 --> 46:42.450]  Yeah, like a left here.
[46:42.510 --> 46:43.490]  Oh, okay, so it's through here.
[46:44.750 --> 46:45.870]  Sweet, so we're just close.
[46:45.930 --> 46:48.350]  And then you just need this to make your way out.
[46:52.810 --> 46:55.010]  Was it 12 golden acorns for the car?
[46:55.450 --> 46:56.690]  I believe so, yeah.
[46:56.850 --> 46:57.670]  I think we're really close.
[46:58.150 --> 47:00.230]  Yeah, but we need like 400 regular.
[47:00.930 --> 47:01.290]  Yeah.
[47:04.390 --> 47:06.070]  I don't think you need another one. I think you're good.
[47:06.330 --> 47:06.990]  Going back for the gun.
[47:08.290 --> 47:09.910]  Oh. Isn't there just a gun on the street?
[47:11.570 --> 47:12.570]  Going back for the gun.
[47:13.030 --> 47:13.750]  Jesus Christ.
[47:16.690 --> 47:18.170]  It gives you all the mechanics.
[47:19.390 --> 47:20.490]  You keep saying that.
[47:20.490 --> 47:22.190]  Yeah, and I keep being right.
[47:23.590 --> 47:24.470]  Yeah, sometimes.
[47:25.790 --> 47:26.230]  Ooh.
[47:27.950 --> 47:29.350]  Now you have to get on the roof.
[47:30.010 --> 47:30.230]  Yep.
[47:31.090 --> 47:34.930]  I think you gotta go where you were, like jumping on the cake or whatever.
[47:35.610 --> 47:36.550]  I think there's a...
[47:37.570 --> 47:38.070]  The trellis?
[47:38.490 --> 47:40.970]  I don't think it's the climbing.
[47:41.390 --> 47:42.710]  I think you have to...
[47:43.290 --> 47:44.790]  bounce on the umbrella.
[47:46.590 --> 47:48.390]  The umbrella. Okay, we'll go try it.
[47:48.390 --> 47:50.070]  I just want to get the gun in case we need it though.
[47:53.770 --> 47:54.730]  Let's go look.
[47:58.740 --> 47:59.860]  You might not even need to.
[47:59.900 --> 48:02.900]  You might just be able to jump somewhere kind of like medium high.
[48:03.400 --> 48:03.820]  Oh, you know what?
[48:04.100 --> 48:05.620]  We can probably get on the ledge.
[48:10.950 --> 48:12.790]  Just gonna bump right into the... there you go.
[48:18.150 --> 48:18.410]  Yeah.
[48:18.770 --> 48:19.270]  Hell yeah.
[48:19.450 --> 48:20.290]  Hell yeah.
[48:21.930 --> 48:23.650]  Top of the yellow house.
[48:23.650 --> 48:26.350]  That's the classic turn of phrase that we all say.
[48:26.590 --> 48:28.350]  Top of the yellow house to you.
[48:31.030 --> 48:31.630]  Oh.
[48:33.450 --> 48:34.630]  Oh, that one's close.
[48:37.370 --> 48:38.050]  Eh, fuck it.
[48:40.670 --> 48:41.270]  Nice.
[48:42.930 --> 48:44.610]  Alright, we'll get these guys.
[48:47.410 --> 48:49.650]  Alright, let's see if it...
[48:50.430 --> 48:51.950]  Yeah, there you go.
[48:51.950 --> 48:52.810]  Hell yeah.
[48:52.950 --> 48:56.290]  So you're still missing two golden acorns
[48:56.290 --> 48:57.070]  and two outfits.
[48:58.010 --> 48:59.950]  Well, in this whole area.
[49:01.110 --> 49:01.850]  Oh, the area.
[49:01.870 --> 49:02.830]  The cookout party, yeah.
[49:03.610 --> 49:04.770]  Okay, so let's take a look around.
[49:06.050 --> 49:07.770]  Oh, there's a grill.
[49:08.090 --> 49:09.270]  Has to be a grill room.
[49:09.270 --> 49:10.410]  You gotta blow it up.
[49:13.590 --> 49:14.550]  Golden propane.
[49:16.730 --> 49:18.090]  And then go for a grenade.
[49:18.330 --> 49:19.950]  The golden thing needs big firepower.
[49:19.950 --> 49:20.570]  Firepower.
[49:21.910 --> 49:23.210]  Should we get a grenade?
[49:24.010 --> 49:25.230]  I guess so, yeah.
[49:25.770 --> 49:26.670]  I think it's a small flame.
[49:31.580 --> 49:32.500]  Get the grenade.
[49:36.460 --> 49:37.400]  I'm real excited.
[49:37.540 --> 49:39.800]  I got my Alarmo clock.
[49:40.160 --> 49:41.020]  Oh, did you get it?
[49:41.360 --> 49:41.940]  I bought one.
[49:43.540 --> 49:43.980]  Alarmo?
[49:44.420 --> 49:46.600]  It's the new Nintendo alarm clock.
[49:47.160 --> 49:47.960]  What did you set it to?
[49:48.380 --> 49:51.340]  Haven't set it up yet, but I'm really excited to have Bowser
[49:51.340 --> 49:53.400]  yell at me tomorrow morning to wake up.
[49:54.480 --> 49:56.200]  I'm so excited about it,
[49:56.320 --> 49:57.720]  I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.360]  So what is it? It's just a clock?
[50:01.600 --> 50:03.500]  It's a clock with a motion
[50:03.500 --> 50:05.320]  sensor in it, and when
[50:05.320 --> 50:07.360]  you wake up, it tracks your
[50:07.360 --> 50:09.480]  movement, and to try to encourage you
[50:09.480 --> 50:11.340]  to move more, it makes sound effects.
[50:12.440 --> 50:13.780]  That was really cool.
[50:14.120 --> 50:14.800]  Oh, yeah!
[50:15.940 --> 50:17.060]  I killed the chef, but whatever.
[50:18.040 --> 50:19.720]  Yeah, it keeps screaming at you and stuff.
[50:19.720 --> 50:20.960]  It's pretty cool.
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.480]  Kill the cook, that's what he was wearing.
[50:25.280 --> 50:25.720]  Alright,
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.660]  I think you gotta keep looking around here, because we're
[50:27.660 --> 50:29.340]  missing an outfit, or two outfits,
[50:29.540 --> 50:30.540]  and an acorn.
[50:32.900 --> 50:33.780]  Thank you so much
[50:33.780 --> 50:34.580]  for ordering a shirt.
[50:35.820 --> 50:36.920]  Oh, yeah, thank you.
[50:36.940 --> 50:39.460]  Everyone go to
[50:40.760 --> 50:41.640]  regulationstore.com
[50:41.640 --> 50:43.600]  or regulationstore.store
[50:44.980 --> 50:45.740]  Take him out.
[50:46.300 --> 50:46.960]  Finish his ass.
[50:46.960 --> 50:47.180]  Ah!
[50:49.720 --> 50:50.360]  Yeah, Apollo
[50:50.740 --> 50:51.060]  squirrel!
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.380]  You tell him who's boss, squirrel.
[50:55.180 --> 50:56.900]  Excuse me, pardon? That squirrel wants
[50:56.900 --> 50:57.240]  you!
[50:59.860 --> 51:00.800]  Take him out.
[51:01.020 --> 51:02.280]  Uncle squirrel.
[51:04.140 --> 51:08.620]  God, it's so cool.
[51:09.920 --> 51:10.180]  Whee!
[51:10.640 --> 51:11.280]  Blood.
[51:13.460 --> 51:14.740]  Yeah, having like a
[51:14.740 --> 51:15.120]  squirrel stick.
[51:18.620 --> 51:19.740]  Bye-bye!
[51:25.180 --> 51:26.720]  Would this be like
[51:26.720 --> 51:28.240]  the peak of Michael Bay's career?
[51:28.540 --> 51:29.960]  If he just made squirrel with a gun?
[51:30.340 --> 51:32.660]  Yeah. Don't make Skibbity Toilet
[51:32.660 --> 51:33.540]  the movie, make this.
[51:37.100 --> 51:38.580]  Maybe up in the
[51:38.580 --> 51:39.420]  tree.
[51:40.540 --> 51:41.760]  Let's try climbing it.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.700]  It's a classic squirrel move, right?
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.300]  Classic squirrel move.
[51:46.360 --> 51:48.580]  The action a squirrel actually performs in real life
[51:48.580 --> 51:50.180]  looks the most wrong in this game.
[51:51.420 --> 51:52.660]  Why does he look so weird
[51:52.660 --> 51:53.040]  doing that?
[51:55.580 --> 51:57.100]  How does that man get there?
[51:57.200 --> 51:57.880]  What the fuck?
[51:57.980 --> 51:59.560]  Oh, that's the chef. You blew him up.
[52:00.360 --> 52:01.800]  Oh, you put him on the roof.
[52:03.660 --> 52:04.380]  Maybe that?
[52:04.680 --> 52:06.300]  Does that count as part of the cookout?
[52:06.480 --> 52:08.740]  I'm not sure. If not that, then behind you is a
[52:08.740 --> 52:09.220]  flag.
[52:12.960 --> 52:13.520]  And it might be that.
[52:13.520 --> 52:13.780]  Oh, there.
[52:15.580 --> 52:17.500]  That might just be outside. Let's go take a look.
[52:18.540 --> 52:19.580]  The guy landed
[52:19.580 --> 52:20.140]  on the roof.
[52:20.980 --> 52:22.000]  Did you just ground pound?
[52:22.680 --> 52:23.400]  I did.
[52:25.200 --> 52:26.180]  Alright, let's go take a look.
[52:28.180 --> 52:29.580]  Now I want to go back and see
[52:29.580 --> 52:31.460]  if there's any frames of him going up
[52:31.460 --> 52:32.340]  in the air and landing on the roof.
[52:34.280 --> 52:35.600]  Oh, I can climb those people.
[52:35.700 --> 52:36.460]  Do you think...
[52:36.460 --> 52:39.360]  It might be the people. It looks like they want
[52:39.360 --> 52:40.960]  something. It looks like they want food.
[52:41.520 --> 52:41.880]  Hey.
[52:44.400 --> 52:45.120]  Is there
[52:45.120 --> 52:46.340]  food you can bring them or something?
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.840]  Yeah, they're missing meat.
[52:49.040 --> 52:51.060]  Oh, go to the grill. Is there meat on the
[52:51.060 --> 52:52.960]  grill or no? Let's find out. I may have
[52:52.960 --> 52:53.700]  blown it up too soon.
[52:54.980 --> 52:56.860]  It was raw. Maybe the cake?
[52:57.120 --> 52:57.660]  I don't think so.
[52:58.680 --> 53:00.700]  Do you eat cake on tomorrow?
[53:02.140 --> 53:02.840]  Oh, bye tomorrow.
[53:04.060 --> 53:05.060]  How can we feed
[53:05.060 --> 53:06.800]  these fools? I don't think this is it.
[53:06.860 --> 53:08.800]  I think you gotta...
[53:08.800 --> 53:10.940]  Would you like me to mess your hair?
[53:12.040 --> 53:14.040]  I don't like this.
[53:16.200 --> 53:16.680]  Can...
[53:16.680 --> 53:18.140]  Ah, damn it's mean streets out here.
[53:18.620 --> 53:20.020]  Maybe they want to eat a bullet.
[53:21.340 --> 53:22.300]  I mean...
[53:22.300 --> 53:23.480]  Yum yum!
[53:24.040 --> 53:24.340]  Oh!
[53:26.620 --> 53:28.840]  Okay, so they do have something
[53:28.840 --> 53:29.900]  here. Yeah, they're purple.
[53:30.580 --> 53:31.260]  You can just move.
[53:32.040 --> 53:33.140]  You can try moving.
[53:34.340 --> 53:36.660]  What's at their feet? Can you go under the table?
[53:36.660 --> 53:38.780]  No, it's just that
[53:39.400 --> 53:40.600]  aura means you have to do
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.640]  something with or to them. I think it
[53:42.640 --> 53:44.740]  means you can climb them. You wanna try talking
[53:44.740 --> 53:46.620]  to the chef? Now that he's
[53:46.620 --> 53:47.040]  on the roof?
[53:48.720 --> 53:49.880]  Yeah, let's go ahead.
[53:50.900 --> 53:52.160]  Can you climb that trellis or no?
[53:53.740 --> 53:54.460]  Let's find out.
[53:54.780 --> 53:55.280]  Let's try it.
[53:56.720 --> 53:58.540]  I can't climb that, and I can't climb
[53:58.540 --> 54:01.100]  that. What about the
[54:01.100 --> 54:02.000]  downspout? Nope.
[54:03.360 --> 54:03.760]  Downspout?
[54:03.760 --> 54:06.000]  Yeah, the
[54:06.000 --> 54:06.420]  downspout.
[54:07.640 --> 54:09.660]  The waterspout. Downspout.
[54:10.580 --> 54:11.340]  Down straight.
[54:11.600 --> 54:13.600]  The downspout.
[54:13.820 --> 54:15.320]  You know, from the gutter?
[54:15.980 --> 54:17.820]  Yeah, just never heard it called a downspout.
[54:18.260 --> 54:19.420]  Wash the spider out?
[54:21.020 --> 54:21.880]  Down came the
[54:21.880 --> 54:22.540]  rain. Yeah.
[54:23.540 --> 54:24.080]  The downspout.
[54:26.640 --> 54:27.720]  Am I wrong?
[54:27.900 --> 54:29.880]  What spouts go up, though? Isn't that redundant?
[54:30.500 --> 54:31.420]  You talking about the upspout?
[54:31.980 --> 54:33.500]  Yeah, what's the upspout in a house?
[54:33.780 --> 54:34.720]  Well, the sun comes up.
[54:35.820 --> 54:37.320]  No, the sun will come
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.000]  out. Tomorrow?
[54:40.220 --> 54:41.360]  Oh, that's an outfit.
[54:41.500 --> 54:43.400]  Yeah, there's something up there. If you ever, you know,
[54:43.600 --> 54:44.720]  get up there. I got it.
[54:46.140 --> 54:47.540]  Oh, a pretty dress!
[54:47.680 --> 54:48.600]  A dress!
[54:50.160 --> 54:50.560]  Beautiful!
[54:51.640 --> 54:52.680]  Beauty and the Beast!
[54:52.980 --> 54:55.520]  It's gonna look so cute when I murder those
[54:55.520 --> 54:55.880]  fools.
[54:58.740 --> 54:59.420]  Maybe there's
[54:59.420 --> 55:00.200]  meat in the kitchen.
[55:01.100 --> 55:02.180]  That would make sense.
[55:03.500 --> 55:04.660]  Can you shoot the fridge?
[55:05.360 --> 55:06.460]  Yeah, I was thinking that.
[55:07.240 --> 55:07.640]  No.
[55:12.240 --> 55:13.360]  What could it
[55:13.360 --> 55:14.800]  be? It's gotta be something outside.
[55:15.680 --> 55:15.960]  Yeah.
[55:18.140 --> 55:19.400]  Should we have a word with the
[55:19.400 --> 55:20.780]  chef? I guess.
[55:21.660 --> 55:23.020]  Not really sure what else to do.
[55:23.720 --> 55:24.900]  Like a bird you could shoot?
[55:26.380 --> 55:27.460]  Is that meat on the
[55:27.460 --> 55:28.420]  left? Behind you?
[55:28.940 --> 55:31.440]  I thought it was bricks. Oh, is it bricks? It's bricks.
[55:31.600 --> 55:32.300]  Yeah, it looks like bricks.
[55:34.780 --> 55:35.540]  Excuse me!
[55:37.220 --> 55:37.640]  Mr.
[55:37.780 --> 55:39.380]  Chef. I'm gonna climb you.
[55:40.760 --> 55:41.500]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[55:42.220 --> 55:43.440]  Is this just a prompt to
[55:43.440 --> 55:44.320]  kill him? Absolutely.
[55:45.500 --> 55:45.940]  Oh no!
[55:47.300 --> 55:47.720]  Oh no!
[55:49.280 --> 55:50.120]  Oh no!
[55:51.100 --> 55:51.760]  He lived!
[55:54.900 --> 55:55.740]  Plot armor.
[55:55.740 --> 55:56.380]  Plot armor.
[55:56.780 --> 55:59.580]  What if by blowing it up before we did the other thing, we
[55:59.580 --> 56:01.540]  glitched out of it? I don't think so.
[56:02.240 --> 56:03.700]  Whoa! What the
[56:03.700 --> 56:05.420]  fuck? What the damn was that?
[56:05.440 --> 56:06.540]  I entered this.
[56:06.620 --> 56:09.520]  Do you think the meat's around?
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.720]  Like it exploded and you have to
[56:11.720 --> 56:13.400]  find the meat? Oh, maybe.
[56:13.560 --> 56:15.060]  Do you have a max pain mode?
[56:15.540 --> 56:16.700]  Yeah, there is.
[56:17.320 --> 56:18.320]  Oh, wow.
[56:18.700 --> 56:20.660]  Look at how the squirrel's running.
[56:22.440 --> 56:23.700]  Get out of this mode.
[56:23.700 --> 56:24.820]  You're gonna use it all.
[56:26.140 --> 56:27.680]  Oh, she just runs like that after
[56:27.680 --> 56:28.800]  putting on the...
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.500]  There's gotta be meat around here somewhere, though.
[56:32.060 --> 56:32.420]  Right?
[56:34.820 --> 56:35.180]  Meat?
[56:35.780 --> 56:36.480]  Nope, flour.
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.680]  Do you think it blasted
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.480]  into the street? Oh, maybe in the garbage?
[56:41.560 --> 56:43.560]  Oh, maybe the garbage? Can you make the meat trash food?
[56:44.340 --> 56:45.080]  Is that a grenade?
[56:45.800 --> 56:46.160]  Oh.
[56:47.440 --> 56:49.120]  Oh, your grenade's in the trash.
[56:49.260 --> 56:51.340]  Oh, that's pretty cool. I don't think you need that.
[56:51.340 --> 56:51.700]  Free!
[56:53.900 --> 56:54.860]  Oh, my God.
[56:55.400 --> 56:57.380]  That's for you. Toast the buns!
[56:59.180 --> 56:59.920]  Oh, they're toasted.
[57:00.540 --> 57:00.880]  Oh, shit.
[57:01.400 --> 57:03.020]  Does anyone in the chat know?
[57:03.520 --> 57:04.440]  You popped a nut out.
[57:05.400 --> 57:06.080]  Oh, I did?
[57:07.020 --> 57:07.380]  Oh, yeah.
[57:10.120 --> 57:10.380]  Huh.
[57:11.540 --> 57:11.940]  So, what?
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.800]  It's on the ground nearby is what somebody said in the chat.
[57:15.760 --> 57:17.420]  I don't know that it is.
[57:19.020 --> 57:19.800]  You chatted that one?
[57:20.940 --> 57:21.340]  The...
[57:21.340 --> 57:24.020]  I just... I don't know what nearby means in this case,
[57:24.060 --> 57:24.480]  I suppose.
[57:27.160 --> 57:27.720]  Oh, you
[57:27.720 --> 57:29.900]  come back later, it resets is what somebody said.
[57:30.200 --> 57:30.960]  Ah. Oh.
[57:31.640 --> 57:33.780]  Oh, okay. So we did screw it up. Bye.
[57:35.380 --> 57:35.780]  Oh.
[57:36.260 --> 57:37.640]  Is it an RPG or something? RPG.
[57:37.640 --> 57:39.700]  Holy shit. That's way better than a car.
[57:40.080 --> 57:40.920]  Oh, you don't have enough.
[57:41.340 --> 57:43.940]  I sure don't. You missed it in the rude?
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.100]  Oh, kick that guy off there.
[57:46.400 --> 57:47.600]  Oh, wait, wait. Is that meat right there?
[57:47.600 --> 57:48.480]  Turn around. Where?
[57:48.760 --> 57:50.080]  Turn around.
[57:50.580 --> 57:50.780]  Where?
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.220]  Oh. God.
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.080]  That is meat.
[57:59.320 --> 58:00.380]  Out of the way, dick.
[58:03.500 --> 58:05.580]  I got a burger I gotta serve.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.260]  I got a single patty.
[58:07.740 --> 58:09.060]  Oh, that's great.
[58:09.160 --> 58:10.880]  So you blew up the grill and the grill
[58:10.880 --> 58:12.120]  shot the meat everywhere.
[58:12.860 --> 58:14.500]  Can you aim? Yeah.
[58:18.520 --> 58:19.000]  Alright.
[58:19.000 --> 58:19.060]  Alright.
[58:21.640 --> 58:23.040]  That wasn't your fault.
[58:23.340 --> 58:25.020]  It just looked so bad.
[58:25.960 --> 58:27.020]  It looked awful.
[58:27.480 --> 58:28.500]  Alright, let's try it from here.
[58:31.760 --> 58:32.200]  Okay.
[58:32.580 --> 58:34.940]  Oh, did it go? Alright, cool.
[58:35.060 --> 58:36.560]  So there's more in the road then.
[58:36.600 --> 58:37.680]  There's three more meats.
[58:38.320 --> 58:40.840]  There's one to the left of where you were.
[58:41.540 --> 58:42.120]  Okay. Oh.
[58:42.700 --> 58:43.220]  That's a grenade.
[58:44.880 --> 58:47.040]  Yeah, I guess blowing up the thing first is hard
[58:47.040 --> 58:47.720]  for the meat.
[58:48.740 --> 58:50.420]  I think you have to blow it up.
[58:50.880 --> 58:51.880]  Otherwise it's not cooked.
[58:53.320 --> 58:54.420]  Oh, what's this?
[58:54.840 --> 58:55.280]  Trash?
[58:55.800 --> 59:01.180]  I don't see any...
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.100]  I know. I know you don't see any.
[59:04.360 --> 59:04.960]  Do you?
[59:05.040 --> 59:05.220]  Where?
[59:06.820 --> 59:08.640]  I don't think it's going to be this far.
[59:08.760 --> 59:09.960]  What was that red thing?
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.380]  That's how far it was on the other side.
[59:13.500 --> 59:14.580]  The red thing under where?
[59:14.580 --> 59:16.320]  Under that hedge back there.
[59:21.190 --> 59:22.570]  I'm not sure where you're...
[59:22.570 --> 59:22.890]  Yeah, they're there.
[59:22.910 --> 59:25.490]  What was that?
[59:26.130 --> 59:26.550]  Grenade.
[59:28.530 --> 59:29.510]  Throw it at this guy.
[59:29.890 --> 59:30.250]  Oh shit.
[59:30.690 --> 59:32.270]  Is that meat by his foot?
[59:33.090 --> 59:34.950]  It might be. Oh no, it's a can.
[59:37.010 --> 59:37.930]  Get those nuts!
[59:38.190 --> 59:38.750]  No witnesses.
[59:40.710 --> 59:42.170]  There was one in the street
[59:42.170 --> 59:43.210]  where he picked up the first one.
[59:43.890 --> 59:44.070]  Okay.
[59:44.670 --> 59:46.170]  One minute away from 5-0-1.
[59:46.310 --> 59:47.270]  We're so close.
[59:48.550 --> 59:49.430]  Dildo Baggins.
[59:52.790 --> 59:53.730]  Thanks for the sub.
[59:59.630 --> 01:00:00.810]  Oh, what's that to the right?
[01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:01.990]  Meat. Meat. Meat. Meat.
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:02.230]  Where?
[01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.270]  The chest. What's in that one?
[01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:06.830]  Oh, that's the rocket launcher.
[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:08.050]  Can.
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.830]  Oh, meat.
[01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:13.910]  Cool. Tucked in the grass.
[01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:15.170]  Bimch.
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.570]  With the gifted sub.
[01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.190]  Oh, Bimch is back.
[01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.250]  Hell yeah. Thanks, Bimch.
[01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.930]  Thanks, Bimch.
[01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:24.330]  Gifted sub on 5 o'clock.
[01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.950]  It's just about quitting time.
[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:30.490]  Oh no, Nick.
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.470]  Come on.
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:35.110]  Maybe I can just drop it. Let's try it.
[01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.910]  Yeah!
[01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.010]  Admittedly.
[01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.530]  5-0-1, baby!
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:42.990]  Best time of the week.
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.550]  Oh, put those feet up.
[01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.930]  Slap these meats down.
[01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.910]  We gotta get these meats and we gotta wrap it up.
[01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:50.070]  Oh wait, there's one in the street!
[01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:51.510]  Street meat.
[01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:54.690]  And it looks like maybe that's it.
[01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:56.530]  I think it was a can.
[01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.590]  Could you ride that running person?
[01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:01.050]  That'd be a hell of a way to get around.
[01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:02.190]  Yeah, it would be.
[01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.970]  Can you ride that
[01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:05.650]  running person?
[01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.110]  Oh, Flurgon's
[01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:10.170]  flurged another 5.
[01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.650]  Oh my god!
[01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.470]  This Flurgon is
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:15.250]  spumming, dude.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:19.720]  Nice.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.960]  Alright, one more. Alright guys, keep your eyes peeled.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.160]  If you see it, let us know.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.220]  It's steaming.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.380]  It's steaming.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.060]  Steaming street meat.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.900]  It is 5-0-1.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.540]  We're getting crazy mode in here.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.720]  I love it. Happy to be here.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.940]  This is a fun-ass game. I'm probably gonna play that.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.780]  Play this game soon.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.180]  This looks great.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.600]  Can you hide in the mound?
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:44.900]  I think you can.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.920]  I think you're supposed to.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.980]  Looks like the mound is hideable.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.140]  Climb a flying pole to unlock tutorials.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.200]  Totals.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.000]  Totals.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.840]  He's been drinking, Eric.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.220]  It's okay.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.220]  I've only had a beer.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.100]  By the tree next to the house.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.140]  By the tree next to the house.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:06.640]  Deadly Robert's yelling.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.140]  Well, we'll see if Deadly Robert's right.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.760]  Go, Deadly.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.260]  This is a tree next to the house.
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:16.960]  I don't see anything.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.860]  That's trash.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.920]  That is definitely a can that we saw.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.840]  Here, just in case.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.760]  You banged your squirrel cock on it.
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:30.940]  Closer to the fence.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.420]  Closer to the fence.
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.980]  Is there a little sneaky fence meat?
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.520]  Oh, I see it.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.120]  There it is.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.160]  Thank you.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.080]  Thank you, Dr. Robert or whatever.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.660]  I don't know what we're supposed to find first, I assume.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:47.760]  Thanks, Dr. Robot.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.780]  Dr. Robot, appreciate it.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.600]  We did it!
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.140]  Eat the meat.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.160]  Yeah!
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.460]  We cleared the yellow house.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:01.600]  Okay, now to take us out,
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.740]  you're gonna go ride that runner.
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.860]  Ride the runner.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.580]  And then that'll be the end of the stream.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.860]  Guys, thanks so much for watching.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.120]  You can watch this VOD on Tuesday
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.500]  on our Regulation Gameplay channel.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.400]  If you haven't yet, go subscribe to that channel.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.500]  Bullet time!
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.820]  Next time it's bullet time.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.480]  I don't think it would make a difference.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.300]  Oh god, she's fast.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.900]  Go, turn around and catch up.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:25.740]  There you go.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.660]  Oh, squirrel cloud!
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.280]  Oh, it's me!
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.220]  That's pretty cool.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.480]  And he's got an acorn.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.160]  That's fun.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.320]  Here we go.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.400]  He's gonna line up on the middle of the street.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.760]  Yeah, I feel good about this.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.640]  Oh, here she comes.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.100]  She might go straight.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:44.920]  Nope.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.160]  Come on, you gotta fight.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.360]  I wanna see if you can ride her.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.340]  We also missed an outfit in the yellow house.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:54.880]  It's okay.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:55.720]  Here she comes.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.500]  Here she comes.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.720]  She's coming back.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.000]  She's looping.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:02.500]  She's...
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.720]  Going back around the other way!
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:09.280]  I love the way the squirrel runs in the desert.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.100]  It's so funny.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.380]  Is she gonna come around this way?
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.640]  I'm swinging the camera just to be sure.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.600]  Squirrels have big old clown feet.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:17.700]  Oh yeah.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.320]  Oh wow, yeah it does.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.080]  I don't think she's coming this way.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.500]  I don't think so either.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.590]  I wanna make clown shoes for squirrels.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.820]  I think they would just be regular shoes.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.900]  Yeah, I was about to say.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.580]  Did I see her?
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.840]  Just go back to there.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.080]  Here she comes.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:34.900]  This is it.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.220]  Okay, here she comes. Ready?
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:38.600]  Squirrel time!
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:40.980]  Jump on.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:42.680]  Oh!
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.200]  She's too powerful!
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.180]  Oh shit!
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.000]  Well guys, that's the way we go out.
