[00:00.000 --> 00:01.620]  All right, guys, we're live. Yo, what's up?
[00:01.980 --> 00:02.980]  How's everyone doing?
[00:03.140 --> 00:06.180]  We are playing Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.
[00:06.260 --> 00:07.160]  Is that what this one is?
[00:08.080 --> 00:10.980]  And we have set out to...
[00:10.980 --> 00:12.500]  Why did somebody say extreme raccoon?
[00:12.580 --> 00:14.460]  Did it sound like I said extreme raccoon?
[00:15.420 --> 00:17.680]  Nah, an extreme raccoon would be pretty cool.
[00:18.020 --> 00:18.820]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:18.960 --> 00:20.340]  He probably serves and skydives.
[00:21.160 --> 00:25.380]  We are trying our best to see what an hour of this defend looks like.
[00:25.600 --> 00:28.880]  Andrew, Geoff, I guess Gavin will probably be back in just a second.
[00:28.880 --> 00:30.080]  I'm right here, son.
[00:30.400 --> 00:32.340]  How are you guys feeling about all this?
[00:32.480 --> 00:33.440]  Feeling good.
[00:33.580 --> 00:34.800]  We're going to have fun.
[00:35.160 --> 00:38.140]  When did we do this with five or six people?
[00:38.880 --> 00:40.520]  Yeah, typically we haven't done this.
[00:40.580 --> 00:41.420]  And when was the last time?
[00:41.500 --> 00:42.380]  When did we get the achievement?
[00:42.980 --> 00:45.500]  24th of November, 2007.
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.840]  Is that 17 years ago?
[00:51.080 --> 00:51.760]  That is correct.
[00:51.860 --> 00:52.620]  I don't know how.
[00:53.400 --> 00:57.380]  I don't know how that's possible, but it was, in fact, 17 years ago.
[00:57.380 --> 01:01.620]  So you and I, 17 years later, are still playing this dumb game together.
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.580]  Yeah. And then we tried this the other day
[01:05.580 --> 01:09.180]  just to see if we could kind of get into a lobby and make this kind of work.
[01:09.260 --> 01:11.500]  And then it didn't work.
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.380]  Andrew, did you update the game and everything in the title?
[01:14.560 --> 01:15.540]  Lost of Us 2.
[01:15.680 --> 01:16.820]  Doing it right now.
[01:17.420 --> 01:18.720]  OK, so the so no.
[01:18.980 --> 01:21.500]  No, I've been working on it the whole time.
[01:21.960 --> 01:23.220]  My computer is slow.
[01:23.980 --> 01:25.080]  You set the start.
[01:25.080 --> 01:28.900]  I have been actively trying to do this from the moment you said do it.
[01:28.940 --> 01:31.060]  I'm literally. It's been.
[01:31.440 --> 01:34.500]  I can. Yeah, I can tell he's been trying because he's been quiet.
[01:34.880 --> 01:36.900]  It's literally been.
[01:37.160 --> 01:39.100]  He's not allowed to do stuff.
[01:39.300 --> 01:40.740]  I yeah. No, that's hey, Gavin.
[01:40.860 --> 01:42.900]  I accept responsibility for.
[01:43.140 --> 01:43.940]  Just Adams.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.220]  With the. I apologize.
[01:45.480 --> 01:46.120]  Just Adams.
[01:46.200 --> 01:48.260]  With the 550 subs. Thank you very much.
[01:48.380 --> 01:52.960]  OK, OK, so I guess we're going to give it a shot.
[01:53.120 --> 01:54.340]  Nick was supposed to be here.
[01:54.340 --> 01:55.600]  Had something come up.
[01:55.680 --> 01:59.420]  So now I'm desperately hoping that we achieve this without him.
[01:59.540 --> 02:02.680]  What this really means is that we're down 600 bullets.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.640]  Yeah. What if you if the audience wasn't here for the let's play
[02:07.640 --> 02:10.620]  we recorded recently, but Nick, Nick, the one we haven't released.
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.520]  Yeah. Nick is attracted to explosions for some reason. Yeah.
[02:16.580 --> 02:18.420]  But you know, I guess we're going to find out.
[02:18.560 --> 02:20.960]  I'm ready if you guys are ready to play the game.
[02:21.260 --> 02:22.420]  Andrew, are you concentrating?
[02:22.420 --> 02:25.220]  No, I look. Yeah, I update the thing.
[02:25.300 --> 02:26.560]  I'm fully focused.
[02:26.860 --> 02:30.300]  It looks like, oh, guys, we're all level five streamers now.
[02:30.340 --> 02:31.620]  I don't know what that means. Yep.
[02:31.920 --> 02:34.780]  OK, guys, hopefully that what?
[02:35.460 --> 02:37.220]  Well, to the level five streamer.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.780]  I was like, oh, I thought, OK, OK, I thought something happened.
[02:40.020 --> 02:42.600]  Now, if we do complete this, which is defend for an hour,
[02:42.620 --> 02:44.540]  that would take us to 503.
[02:44.920 --> 02:45.420]  Hell yeah.
[02:45.860 --> 02:47.260]  And that's quitting time.
[02:47.280 --> 02:51.820]  And we said that we have to continue to if if as long as it's before 501,
[02:51.820 --> 02:53.040]  we got to give it another shot.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.720]  Yeah, that's our job.
[02:55.220 --> 02:57.600]  Yeah. So just Jadams again.
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.700]  10. Oh, no, it didn't save my gun.
[02:59.820 --> 03:00.860]  It didn't save my gun.
[03:02.080 --> 03:04.260]  Oh, well, it's a M36 saw, right?
[03:04.300 --> 03:05.960]  So we want to. Yeah, I believe so.
[03:06.140 --> 03:07.040]  OK, got it. Yep.
[03:07.400 --> 03:08.900]  Oh, fuck. Where is it?
[03:09.020 --> 03:09.560]  OK, I got it.
[03:10.600 --> 03:11.320]  Oh, no.
[03:12.320 --> 03:14.260]  Does everybody remember where we hide?
[03:14.300 --> 03:14.740]  Oh, yeah.
[03:14.860 --> 03:16.320]  Where we start now?
[03:17.540 --> 03:20.280]  Uh, now I remember I was my hut.
[03:20.280 --> 03:20.840]  Oh, there is.
[03:21.220 --> 03:22.780]  OK. Oh, my God.
[03:23.020 --> 03:25.900]  Guys, prepare for a perspective like you've never seen.
[03:26.360 --> 03:28.360]  Oh, we didn't get an Eric name burn, huh?
[03:29.080 --> 03:30.340]  No. Why would I give you a name?
[03:30.420 --> 03:31.440]  I don't give a fuck about it.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.820]  People know who they're watching.
[03:33.160 --> 03:33.500]  It's true.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.560]  He doesn't care. He doesn't care.
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.460]  I don't give a fuck.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.160]  How do you switch shoulders again?
[03:39.740 --> 03:41.340]  RB, right bumper.
[03:41.620 --> 03:44.200]  OK, you're watching Eric's point of view.
[03:44.760 --> 03:47.660]  For the next for the next hour.
[03:47.660 --> 03:50.020]  Or at least me laying on the ground.
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.660]  There is an infinite amount of AI enemies.
[03:53.280 --> 03:56.260]  And there is a finite amount of ammo.
[03:57.420 --> 03:58.680]  Yes, very much.
[03:59.220 --> 04:02.300]  Oh, oh, don't forget to switch your gun to single fire.
[04:02.860 --> 04:04.280]  Oh, good call.
[04:04.340 --> 04:06.000]  I've already I've already wasted a lot.
[04:06.360 --> 04:07.180]  Yeah, me too.
[04:07.440 --> 04:10.200]  Hold A and then right on the D-pad.
[04:10.860 --> 04:12.300]  Do you remember what a D-pad is, Geoff?
[04:12.460 --> 04:13.060]  Yeah, I got it.
[04:13.380 --> 04:15.140]  I just remember what it was called last time.
[04:15.320 --> 04:16.060]  I remember what it was.
[04:16.060 --> 04:17.820]  Bip, bip, bip. Good bips.
[04:17.940 --> 04:19.120]  Good emergency backup bips.
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.020]  Oh, they're getting they're getting close.
[04:21.380 --> 04:22.540]  Yeah, they are getting close.
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.480]  I don't like this.
[04:24.040 --> 04:26.060]  Yeah, I don't feel as safe over here as I thought I would.
[04:26.140 --> 04:28.300]  I don't like I thought I thought your other position
[04:28.300 --> 04:29.820]  when we did this the other day was really good, Geoff.
[04:29.880 --> 04:30.720]  Thanks, man. What changed?
[04:30.940 --> 04:32.440]  I don't know. I was just there's less people.
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.620]  So I was figuring trying to cover differently.
[04:35.180 --> 04:36.000]  Are you trying to be Nick?
[04:36.180 --> 04:39.380]  But I don't definitely I'm trying not to be Nick because I want to be alive,
[04:39.420 --> 04:40.720]  but I will get up and if you say so.
[04:41.720 --> 04:42.900]  OK, you better be careful.
[04:42.980 --> 04:44.240]  You're going to die. Jesus, Geoff.
[04:44.240 --> 04:46.260]  Oh, my God.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.940]  I shot so close to you.
[04:49.140 --> 04:50.860]  Yeah, but you didn't shoot me because we're teammates.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.280]  That's true. Hey, he's got you.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.340]  Yep. Nick again.
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.620]  Nick is not here.
[04:56.720 --> 04:59.100]  Had something come up where he could not play this with us.
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.080]  So real bummed about it too, because he loved dying in this game.
[05:02.540 --> 05:05.340]  Oh, he loved playing three minutes of this thing and going, I'm out.
[05:09.020 --> 05:11.540]  Just try and come in one bullet per person.
[05:11.640 --> 05:12.800]  One click, one head.
[05:12.800 --> 05:14.900]  Why are they upping our ass on the left?
[05:15.080 --> 05:16.060]  They're they're not. They're not.
[05:16.200 --> 05:17.080]  OK, we got them.
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.960]  I'm going to do a little peeking on the right.
[05:20.660 --> 05:21.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:21.580 --> 05:24.120]  Maybe that'll slow him down a little bit because I was doing that.
[05:24.420 --> 05:25.980]  Oh, shit. I forgot to reload.
[05:26.340 --> 05:27.020]  Oh, that was.
[05:27.520 --> 05:28.560]  I'm going back.
[05:28.880 --> 05:29.740]  That was real scary.
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.000]  I don't like that at all.
[05:31.500 --> 05:32.500]  It's scary over there, right?
[05:32.820 --> 05:33.980]  Looks like I poked my head out.
[05:34.120 --> 05:35.180]  They went blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[05:35.640 --> 05:37.860]  Got about 10 diamonds on the other side of this wall.
[05:37.980 --> 05:38.760]  Seems like. Yep.
[05:39.020 --> 05:42.020]  I'm just clicking heads an infinite amount of heads.
[05:45.040 --> 05:45.800]  Die, bitch.
[05:50.380 --> 05:53.580]  I wish I knew how to control the drone so I can move it to be a little bit.
[05:53.720 --> 05:56.780]  Yeah, we we found out and then nobody.
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.120]  I don't know. It's like throwing grenades.
[05:58.320 --> 06:00.260]  I Geoff won't tell us. I did it on accident.
[06:01.020 --> 06:01.620]  He's like telling.
[06:01.780 --> 06:04.500]  I'm telling you, it was something to do with the D-pad.
[06:05.160 --> 06:06.240]  You guys went into it.
[06:06.460 --> 06:07.440]  They're in. They're in.
[06:07.460 --> 06:08.680]  But to our right, what's going on?
[06:08.880 --> 06:09.620]  Wait, what's going on?
[06:09.660 --> 06:11.040]  Where are you? Oh, my God.
[06:12.060 --> 06:14.700]  Andrew, dude, if you went into the drone for a second,
[06:15.160 --> 06:17.380]  if you hold around the bumper and you go drone mode.
[06:17.900 --> 06:19.600]  If you hadn't. I don't care about drone mode.
[06:19.660 --> 06:21.020]  I care about shooting gun mode.
[06:21.040 --> 06:22.820]  Dude, if you hadn't warned me, Gavin, I'd have been dead.
[06:23.460 --> 06:25.740]  As it was, that guy still took a bunch of bullets for some reason.
[06:27.020 --> 06:28.980]  I got 18 shots to a reload.
[06:30.320 --> 06:31.380]  Guys, welcome to the stream.
[06:31.540 --> 06:33.020]  This is what you get for like the next hour.
[06:33.140 --> 06:34.360]  Very quiet and intense.
[06:35.160 --> 06:38.020]  Or hour and a half, depending on when we go through on this.
[06:38.160 --> 06:38.660]  Yeah. You know what I mean?
[06:39.220 --> 06:41.280]  If we start if we start at five.
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.000]  Exactly. And then we do it.
[06:43.000 --> 06:44.780]  We'll be here for an extra hour.
[06:45.420 --> 06:46.540]  Well, we didn't.
[06:46.640 --> 06:47.100]  Extra 59.
[06:47.820 --> 06:49.460]  Yeah, I mean, I guess we'll I guess we'll wait and see.
[06:49.500 --> 06:50.620]  We've got 56 minutes left.
[06:51.260 --> 06:52.400]  Oh, yeah, that's a bit.
[06:52.700 --> 06:54.280]  The red ones are bad.
[06:54.800 --> 06:56.100]  Answering the person in the chat.
[06:56.160 --> 06:57.980]  Yep. Nine bullets to reload.
[06:59.900 --> 07:00.980]  I'm good for a while.
[07:01.320 --> 07:01.960]  I got 31.
[07:02.360 --> 07:04.500]  It's like there's two creeping over on the right towards Andrew.
[07:06.400 --> 07:07.120]  Oh, yeah.
[07:08.280 --> 07:09.100]  Sounds like he has.
[07:09.200 --> 07:09.740]  Everything all right, Andrew?
[07:10.420 --> 07:10.920]  There's.
[07:11.900 --> 07:12.920]  I'm going back.
[07:14.020 --> 07:14.720]  That's a bit.
[07:17.560 --> 07:18.820]  Left side. Got him.
[07:18.960 --> 07:23.720]  Is it the point now where I'm disappointed if I spend two bullets on one person?
[07:25.920 --> 07:31.420]  This is like I've been seeing like the gamer side of Gavin, like since we started this and everything.
[07:31.740 --> 07:35.280]  And it is like, man, he's a real gamer, dude.
[07:35.340 --> 07:37.040]  That's the side of Gavin I know the best.
[07:38.440 --> 07:40.720]  He's a real particular.
[07:40.980 --> 07:43.200]  I spent some of my life as a professional gamer.
[07:44.500 --> 07:45.540]  Professionally bad gamer.
[07:45.920 --> 07:47.180]  Yeah. Make the distinction.
[07:47.340 --> 07:48.660]  You can be paid to be bad.
[07:48.920 --> 07:49.840]  Yeah, it's true.
[07:50.480 --> 07:51.340]  I'm reloading.
[07:51.800 --> 07:52.880]  Oh, shit, me too.
[07:53.600 --> 07:54.540]  I'm good. I'm good.
[07:54.880 --> 07:56.320]  If they creep up.
[07:56.340 --> 07:57.600]  I was calling out my bullets.
[07:57.840 --> 07:58.960]  If they creep up, I got them.
[07:59.000 --> 07:59.640]  Don't worry, I got them.
[08:00.240 --> 08:00.760]  Left side.
[08:01.560 --> 08:01.860]  OK.
[08:03.700 --> 08:04.120]  OK.
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.000]  Oh, I'm dead.
[08:05.080 --> 08:05.840]  They're peeking up.
[08:06.460 --> 08:07.020]  What happened?
[08:07.140 --> 08:07.260]  What's up?
[08:07.520 --> 08:08.100]  I'm dead.
[08:08.380 --> 08:09.140]  You died?
[08:09.340 --> 08:09.760]  What happened?
[08:09.880 --> 08:10.280]  How?
[08:10.640 --> 08:13.040]  I tried to move the drone and I lost it.
[08:13.040 --> 08:13.880]  Stop moving the drone!
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.400]  Who cares about the drone?
[08:15.920 --> 08:16.840]  You're an idiot!
[08:17.720 --> 08:19.160]  Who thinks drone is useless?
[08:19.220 --> 08:20.280]  We know where they are.
[08:20.340 --> 08:21.140]  They're on the map.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.620]  Why did you move the drone?
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.740]  Look at how centered they are now.
[08:24.820 --> 08:25.780]  It looks so much better.
[08:26.220 --> 08:26.680]  Who cares?
[08:27.040 --> 08:27.800]  Who gives a shit?
[08:27.880 --> 08:29.040]  I'm not looking up there.
[08:29.060 --> 08:30.380]  Well, there's a guy on the right.
[08:30.640 --> 08:31.480]  Are you kidding me?
[08:31.480 --> 08:34.780]  I'm going to have to fucking get out of my...
[08:35.420 --> 08:35.780]  Andrew!
[08:36.060 --> 08:37.880]  There's a lot of ammo on the right side.
[08:37.980 --> 08:38.560]  We needed a nick.
[08:38.580 --> 08:40.380]  When can Nick come and play?
[08:40.460 --> 08:41.080]  This sucks.
[08:41.880 --> 08:43.460]  I don't even know the fucking...
[08:43.460 --> 08:44.860]  I don't even know the lay of the land over here.
[08:44.920 --> 08:45.480]  I've never been there.
[08:45.800 --> 08:45.940]  This sucks.
[08:46.140 --> 08:46.320]  Boo!
[08:47.200 --> 08:47.560]  Gavin...
[08:47.560 --> 08:48.820]  I don't think he's called it out.
[08:48.900 --> 08:49.940]  Gavin is bleeding out.
[08:50.460 --> 08:52.260]  Yeah, well, you died and then I got shot.
[08:54.360 --> 08:55.600]  Gavin, do I need to get you up?
[08:56.880 --> 09:00.380]  Are we seriously going with three people from 54 minutes remaining?
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.780]  I mean, this is kind of what we committed to.
[09:02.780 --> 09:03.460]  Okay.
[09:04.900 --> 09:06.140]  I don't think Andrew...
[09:06.140 --> 09:10.060]  I don't think Andrew understands anything he's saying or what he's talking about.
[09:10.220 --> 09:11.140]  There's four of us.
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.280]  Hey, have you updated the game or no?
[09:13.300 --> 09:14.220]  Yeah, it's all good.
[09:14.300 --> 09:14.480]  Yeah.
[09:14.700 --> 09:15.200]  Okay, cool.
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.680]  Well, the important thing is he framed up the drone real well.
[09:23.700 --> 09:24.480]  The drone looks great.
[09:25.060 --> 09:25.700]  Shut up.
[09:26.720 --> 09:27.840]  I'm dead, by the way. I'm out.
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.520]  Andrew, move the drone before we start.
[09:30.300 --> 09:30.660]  Yeah.
[09:30.840 --> 09:32.180]  Well, I didn't know how.
[09:32.820 --> 09:34.740]  You have to use the drone talk. I figured out the drone.
[09:34.780 --> 09:37.340]  It's game time, baby. Let's fucking do this.
[09:37.400 --> 09:38.260]  Get them all, Eric.
[09:38.500 --> 09:39.240]  I was pretty loud, Eric.
[09:39.440 --> 09:40.580]  That was a good full shot.
[09:41.960 --> 09:43.320]  I had two bullets left.
[09:45.780 --> 09:46.140]  Okay.
[09:47.100 --> 09:47.360]  Yeah.
[09:47.900 --> 09:50.460]  Oh, there's a... McGoody says Andrew doesn't even want to play.
[09:50.880 --> 09:52.000]  He doesn't, you can tell.
[09:52.040 --> 09:52.800]  Of course I want to play.
[09:53.780 --> 09:54.180]  Are you ready, Matt?
[09:54.180 --> 09:54.740]  I don't know.
[09:55.500 --> 09:56.600]  Okay, I take it back.
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.400]  Andrew just, he was the first one to ready up on that.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.900]  That seems like he wants to play.
[10:03.660 --> 10:07.120]  I just, I don't get a lot of action on that side, so I was a little caught off guard.
[10:08.720 --> 10:09.040]  Understandable.
[10:09.300 --> 10:09.620]  Understandable.
[10:09.700 --> 10:09.940]  All right.
[10:10.140 --> 10:11.640]  I don't think it's understandable at all.
[10:12.020 --> 10:15.440]  How many people do you usually kill on that side, Andrew?
[10:16.900 --> 10:18.560]  Nothing for a very long time.
[10:18.940 --> 10:20.640]  So it's almost like they knew you were in the drone.
[10:20.800 --> 10:21.500]  Maybe they could tell.
[10:22.320 --> 10:25.260]  They literally, as soon as I went into the drone, the first one popped over.
[10:25.840 --> 10:27.240]  All right, remember to go single shot.
[10:27.780 --> 10:28.400]  Thank you.
[10:28.780 --> 10:30.820]  What is the button for grenade?
[10:31.280 --> 10:31.440]  E.
[10:33.080 --> 10:33.620]  Hold Y.
[10:34.420 --> 10:35.140]  Thank you.
[10:36.660 --> 10:37.600]  Wait, that's not it.
[10:37.780 --> 10:38.500]  No, it's hold B.
[10:39.140 --> 10:39.720]  Thank you.
[10:40.120 --> 10:41.820]  Geoff, me and Geoff are the only ones who are serious about this.
[10:41.900 --> 10:42.680]  Everyone else is a fucking joker.
[10:43.080 --> 10:44.240]  I got 86 kills.
[10:44.820 --> 10:48.140]  I kept, I knew the answer, and they kept saying weird shit.
[10:48.200 --> 10:50.060]  And I kept going like, is it? Am I wrong?
[10:50.140 --> 10:53.580]  And I had to, I could do it myself to make sure I wasn't losing my mind.
[10:53.580 --> 10:56.380]  If you hold right bumper, you can go to the drone cam.
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.740]  Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[10:59.020 --> 11:00.240]  It's not necessary.
[11:00.520 --> 11:01.700]  It doesn't do anything for us.
[11:01.820 --> 11:02.420]  It doesn't matter.
[11:02.600 --> 11:04.240]  I think the chat really wants to go to the drone cam.
[11:04.560 --> 11:05.840]  I don't give a fuck.
[11:05.920 --> 11:07.540]  I think they're popping off the drone cam.
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.860]  I'm not even looking at the chat.
[11:10.320 --> 11:10.880]  Shout out to...
[11:10.880 --> 11:12.220]  Yeah, me, yeah, dude, me neither.
[11:12.580 --> 11:13.920]  Shout out to, yeah.
[11:14.300 --> 11:15.260]  Shout out to drone cam.
[11:16.300 --> 11:17.860]  Shout out to drone cam for chat.
[11:18.200 --> 11:19.780]  Gavin and Eric had this for a while.
[11:21.180 --> 11:22.220]  They got the drone chat.
[11:22.780 --> 11:23.620]  What's up, drone chat?
[11:26.680 --> 11:28.500]  Some guys from Rooster Teeth.
[11:28.620 --> 11:29.340]  What the fuck?
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.740]  What is, I literally don't know what that is.
[11:31.740 --> 11:32.880]  Eric used to work at Rooster Teeth.
[11:32.980 --> 11:33.220]  That's right.
[11:33.520 --> 11:34.340]  Oh, that's right.
[11:34.540 --> 11:35.500]  The Mega64 guy?
[11:36.140 --> 11:36.260]  Yeah.
[11:38.020 --> 11:40.560]  Dude, how does it feel to work at Mega64 and Rooster Teeth?
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.760]  You're the only one that can say that.
[11:42.120 --> 11:43.360]  I am.
[11:45.040 --> 11:48.040]  You know, lowest member on both totem poles.
[11:50.760 --> 11:52.460]  Eric from Razer, right?
[11:52.580 --> 11:55.960]  I mean, you know what happens if you don't have a strong foundation?
[11:56.140 --> 11:58.320]  Your totem pole becomes a topple over pole.
[11:58.600 --> 11:59.140]  That's right.
[12:00.040 --> 12:01.120]  Eric from Razer.
[12:04.360 --> 12:06.040]  Maybe we can work out some sort of brand deal.
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.620]  Yeah, I think that's mostly what I did when I ran social media and then went,
[12:12.560 --> 12:14.160]  Hey, Funhaus, do you want keyboards?
[12:17.540 --> 12:18.020]  What was that?
[12:18.020 --> 12:18.680]  Where's my keyboard?
[12:19.480 --> 12:21.180]  We gave you so many keyboards.
[12:21.260 --> 12:21.800]  It's true.
[12:22.060 --> 12:25.440]  Eric gave me a laptop that Millie used all through high school.
[12:25.720 --> 12:26.600]  Yep, absolutely.
[12:28.220 --> 12:30.900]  So many keyboards, so many mice, so many webcams.
[12:31.820 --> 12:35.580]  Dude, that drone, the new drone position is causing way more shit on my screen.
[12:35.780 --> 12:38.780]  I've got so many diamonds, it's an absolute shitting mess.
[12:39.200 --> 12:40.540]  I can't see what's going on.
[12:40.540 --> 12:42.880]  There are so many diamonds on the screen.
[12:42.880 --> 12:43.200]  What do you mean?
[12:43.500 --> 12:44.560]  Too much data.
[12:44.620 --> 12:46.860]  Because of the drone, I'm getting too much data.
[12:46.860 --> 12:49.200]  I'm seeing too much.
[12:49.200 --> 12:50.100]  He's not kidding.
[12:50.360 --> 12:50.860]  There's too much data.
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.760]  Imagine if Superman couldn't hear a single person at the same time.
[12:55.780 --> 12:57.340]  Okay, well fuck it then. Fuck it.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.100]  Let's get this drone out of there.
[12:59.460 --> 13:00.300]  Let's get rid of him.
[13:00.520 --> 13:06.520]  It's like how Daredevil has to sleep in the hyperbolic chamber, otherwise he just hears people all night long and he can't rest.
[13:06.940 --> 13:08.300]  Can I just kill all those guys?
[13:10.980 --> 13:13.100]  The drone moved, we didn't see it.
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.440]  I threw a grenade, that was awesome!
[13:15.660 --> 13:16.720]  What a toss!
[13:16.720 --> 13:18.420]  If only the drone had been there.
[13:18.640 --> 13:23.140]  Dude, every single red thing on my screen went away.
[13:23.380 --> 13:24.580]  Mine too!
[13:24.820 --> 13:26.440]  That was so awesome!
[13:27.100 --> 13:28.580]  Oh, that was awesome!
[13:30.520 --> 13:33.020]  That legitimately made me feel so good.
[13:35.500 --> 13:39.020]  I just know that I saved Gavin like 13 bullets, so I feel pretty good.
[13:39.020 --> 13:39.940]  You did, it was phenomenal.
[13:40.540 --> 13:43.280]  We need more action like that.
[13:43.840 --> 13:44.400]  Wow.
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.660]  Only 4 minutes in, I'm saving the day.
[13:47.120 --> 13:48.200]  Eric's great, guys.
[13:48.400 --> 13:51.360]  It'd be cool if we just ran through all the enemies super fast.
[13:51.680 --> 13:52.500]  It would be, yeah!
[13:53.240 --> 13:55.700]  Crack some sodas and chill for the last 40 minutes.
[13:56.600 --> 13:57.520]  Soda summer, baby.
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.040]  That's right. Soda summer's almost over, gotta crack those final remaining sodas.
[14:03.780 --> 14:05.660]  Mid-October. Hey, almost over!
[14:05.680 --> 14:06.300]  Almost done!
[14:06.780 --> 14:08.540]  Dude, we went swimming last weekend.
[14:09.240 --> 14:10.740]  Yeah, I know. Summer won't end.
[14:11.080 --> 14:12.980]  I went for a bike ride yesterday, it was so fucking hot.
[14:12.980 --> 14:16.320]  It's been warm, it's nice warm.
[14:16.420 --> 14:17.060]  Yeah, it's good warm.
[14:17.340 --> 14:18.840]  Is ACL again this weekend?
[14:19.220 --> 14:20.660]  No, was it last weekend?
[14:20.800 --> 14:21.480]  It's two weekends.
[14:23.700 --> 14:26.240]  Last weekend was weekend one, this is weekend two.
[14:26.840 --> 14:29.080]  And then the race is next weekend, right?
[14:29.500 --> 14:31.120]  I think it's in two weeks.
[14:31.620 --> 14:31.700]  Okay.
[14:33.140 --> 14:33.620]  Crazy.
[14:34.360 --> 14:36.440]  Anyone hitting up Pinball Expo in Chicago?
[14:37.780 --> 14:38.760]  No, is that something?
[14:38.780 --> 14:40.120]  When is that?
[14:40.920 --> 14:41.740]  It's coming up.
[14:42.980 --> 14:44.520]  I think I'm gonna miss it.
[14:44.540 --> 14:45.020]  Okay.
[14:45.360 --> 14:48.720]  I don't know if Andrew's doing shit on his side,
[14:48.800 --> 14:50.300]  but where...
[14:50.300 --> 14:52.580]  I'm getting shot at by the dudes
[14:52.580 --> 14:54.120]  from his right side that never
[14:54.120 --> 14:54.920]  shoot at me.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.540]  They're usually not...
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.420]  They're usually never alive that long,
[15:00.440 --> 15:00.900]  I don't know.
[15:01.400 --> 15:02.640]  How's covering the flank going?
[15:03.000 --> 15:03.640]  It's going great.
[15:05.780 --> 15:07.040]  Some people cite me out.
[15:07.240 --> 15:10.460]  Are you covering it like a war reporter covers things?
[15:10.460 --> 15:12.760]  Don't look at the drone.
[15:12.840 --> 15:14.020]  You can see...
[15:14.020 --> 15:15.480]  I don't want to look at the drone.
[15:16.180 --> 15:17.900]  Okay, now he's dead.
[15:18.700 --> 15:19.640]  Now he's dead.
[15:22.060 --> 15:23.460]  So he's like a war reporter?
[15:23.780 --> 15:24.860]  Imagine if that was on the news.
[15:25.260 --> 15:26.580]  There's a guy there, he's dead.
[15:26.800 --> 15:27.880]  There's another guy, he's dead.
[15:29.140 --> 15:29.700]  Backing up.
[15:33.780 --> 15:35.280]  Since the start of this bulletin,
[15:36.940 --> 15:37.380]  75...
[15:37.380 --> 15:37.720]  What did he do?
[15:37.720 --> 15:40.080]  A gun like flew
[15:40.080 --> 15:40.980]  through the air.
[15:41.180 --> 15:43.180]  What did it look like on the drone?
[15:44.420 --> 15:45.640]  I didn't have that angle.
[15:45.900 --> 15:46.800]  I'm covering my side.
[15:47.480 --> 15:49.980]  I was told the drone was not needed for your actions,
[15:50.240 --> 15:51.500]  so I moved it over.
[15:52.680 --> 15:53.560]  Geoff, left side.
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.460]  Got him.
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.360]  I like that I can still look at chat,
[15:59.860 --> 16:02.200]  and I just keep clicking the button every few
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.420]  seconds and I'm still getting killed.
[16:08.760 --> 16:09.160]  Alright,
[16:09.360 --> 16:10.420]  I don't wish to panic people,
[16:10.580 --> 16:12.240]  but we are six minutes in,
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.900]  and I have half my ammo gone.
[16:14.240 --> 16:15.740]  No, where's Nick?
[16:15.820 --> 16:17.660]  Where's his dead body for you to take his gun?
[16:18.760 --> 16:20.380]  Yeah, we need to fill this up with eight
[16:20.380 --> 16:22.660]  people and then kill four of them immediately.
[16:27.640 --> 16:30.040]  That would be the funniest way to do a video
[16:30.040 --> 16:32.100]  with Ray, is have him in for two minutes,
[16:32.220 --> 16:34.060]  kill him, and don't let him talk for 50 minutes.
[16:34.220 --> 16:34.680]  Appreciate it.
[16:35.420 --> 16:37.220]  If you die, you can't
[16:37.220 --> 16:38.680]  be in the chat. Oh, Ray died.
[16:39.260 --> 16:40.580]  Give me that gun.
[16:41.380 --> 16:42.300]  You're dead, you're dead.
[16:42.760 --> 16:43.520]  Two minutes.
[16:46.400 --> 16:47.120]  Man, it's a waste
[16:47.120 --> 16:49.120]  shooting at these dudes. I loved you dead,
[16:49.160 --> 16:51.060]  you're dead, because the stakes were so high.
[16:51.320 --> 16:52.660]  It was so fun. You'd literally
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.480]  miss like eight videos.
[16:54.980 --> 16:57.180]  That very first one we did where we machinimated
[16:57.180 --> 16:58.980]  the end and stuff a little bit, that was so much fun.
[16:58.980 --> 17:00.860]  I love that era of doing stuff.
[17:01.540 --> 17:02.280]  Felt very creative.
[17:05.860 --> 17:06.440]  How's your
[17:06.980 --> 17:09.120]  ammo looking, Gavin? About to do a
[17:09.120 --> 17:10.840]  reload, bring me to 300 bullets left.
[17:10.920 --> 17:12.980]  There's a guy who's close, he's shooting
[17:12.980 --> 17:15.000]  at me. Let me know when you got to
[17:15.000 --> 17:16.040]  reload, I got 16 bullets.
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.400]  Alright, I'm gonna...
[17:20.400 --> 17:22.540]  Nice get. Alright.
[17:22.960 --> 17:24.800]  I'm gonna reload now. Reloading.
[17:25.480 --> 17:25.820]  Okay.
[17:26.840 --> 17:29.160]  Reloading. Oh shit, I switched gun instead.
[17:29.440 --> 17:30.500]  Shit. What? What?
[17:31.440 --> 17:32.860]  Why? How? It's okay.
[17:32.860 --> 17:33.300]  It's okay.
[17:35.460 --> 17:37.100]  Just get it back.
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.140]  Use some silenced pistol.
[17:43.900 --> 17:44.760]  What are you talking?
[17:44.880 --> 17:47.280]  What does that mean? Yeah, yeah, I'm back.
[17:47.980 --> 17:49.440]  What was the grunt?
[17:49.700 --> 17:51.260]  I just dropped his gun, he had to
[17:51.260 --> 17:53.200]  find it. I kept switching to pistol.
[17:54.880 --> 17:55.320]  It's...
[17:56.340 --> 17:56.780]  Reloading.
[17:57.740 --> 17:59.260]  Well, it was fine yesterday, but now that I've played
[17:59.260 --> 18:01.300]  GTA today, I keep hitting B
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.660]  for reload. It's tough.
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.380]  These guys fucking crawling
[18:05.380 --> 18:07.440]  are so funny. Dude, the GTA
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.660]  did just fine. The GTA we did
[18:09.660 --> 18:11.120]  yesterday was so fun.
[18:11.380 --> 18:13.720]  It was so fun. We did one
[18:13.720 --> 18:14.860]  yesterday? Yeah.
[18:15.420 --> 18:17.520]  Yeah, what are you talking about? It was your
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.340]  game time. We did one yesterday and two today.
[18:19.840 --> 18:21.740]  Yeah. We've done three GTAs
[18:21.740 --> 18:23.420]  in the last two days, and we still have to do one more.
[18:25.360 --> 18:26.780]  Are you okay, man? Yeah.
[18:27.260 --> 18:29.280]  You been hanging out in the Smee room or what?
[18:29.280 --> 18:31.440]  Eric wants to get spooky with us, so we gotta
[18:32.860 --> 18:33.780]  scare him up.
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.700]  Does it still smell like Smee in there, or what's
[18:35.700 --> 18:37.740]  going on? I think it's
[18:37.740 --> 18:38.740]  alright. Let's get in there.
[18:40.380 --> 18:41.800]  I think in a year it'll be okay.
[18:42.260 --> 18:43.700]  Is it getting there, or are you getting used
[18:43.700 --> 18:45.240]  to it? Yeah, I think it's that.
[18:45.380 --> 18:47.700]  Let me in the middle. That's
[18:47.700 --> 18:48.080]  worse.
[18:50.860 --> 18:51.380]  There he is.
[18:54.740 --> 18:55.940]  I think we had a little break
[18:55.940 --> 18:57.520]  there. There was less diamonds on the screen.
[18:57.520 --> 19:00.140]  Yeah, that was pretty good. Another back baby.
[19:00.420 --> 19:01.260]  I think we got two for there.
[19:02.440 --> 19:03.440]  Can you two for this game?
[19:08.670 --> 19:10.510]  How are they getting so close on the left?
[19:11.510 --> 19:12.710]  You can't see them
[19:12.710 --> 19:14.550]  until the very last second. They'll
[19:14.550 --> 19:16.390]  peek out, and it'll be about the same time
[19:16.390 --> 19:18.610]  I see them for the first time as when you see them also.
[19:19.850 --> 19:20.770]  So I'm keeping an eye
[19:20.770 --> 19:22.170]  on them, but...
[19:22.170 --> 19:24.590]  Everyone I shoot, Eric also shoots, so I should
[19:24.590 --> 19:25.850]  probably shoot less, honestly.
[19:26.610 --> 19:28.690]  I mean, I'm doing the same thing with Gavin, where it's like
[19:28.690 --> 19:29.810]  I'm taking some shots.
[19:30.490 --> 19:32.650]  I get the crawly guys that
[19:32.650 --> 19:33.850]  think they're gonna be fucking
[19:34.550 --> 19:37.090]  super smart soldiers. Don't you guys
[19:37.090 --> 19:38.970]  worry about that right flank, cause I
[19:38.970 --> 19:40.270]  got it locked down.
[19:41.530 --> 19:42.370]  With a drone?
[19:43.410 --> 19:44.590]  Drone and me.
[19:44.770 --> 19:45.890]  Double coverage, Gavin.
[19:47.470 --> 19:48.890]  How are your diamonds?
[19:49.770 --> 19:50.290]  Zero.
[19:50.750 --> 19:52.030]  Nobody's over here currently.
[19:53.330 --> 19:54.850]  Oh yeah, there's a hole in the wall
[19:54.850 --> 19:55.990]  and there's no one there.
[19:55.990 --> 19:58.310]  This is when Nick gets bored
[19:58.310 --> 19:59.910]  and then goes over and he goes, I'm gonna help Andrew.
[20:00.110 --> 20:02.590]  And then he goes, oh
[20:02.590 --> 20:03.570]  I exploded.
[20:04.010 --> 20:06.190]  Now to be fair, even though we don't have Nick
[20:06.190 --> 20:08.290]  Nick did not make it past
[20:08.290 --> 20:09.590]  this point at any point.
[20:09.970 --> 20:12.110]  Already further than Nick has been in the game.
[20:12.330 --> 20:13.270]  So much further.
[20:14.230 --> 20:16.270]  Speaking of so much, that's a lot of diamonds.
[20:16.930 --> 20:17.370]  Yeah it is.
[20:17.830 --> 20:18.710]  10 minutes in.
[20:19.870 --> 20:20.790]  Reloading coming up.
[20:22.070 --> 20:22.550]  Reloading.
[20:24.570 --> 20:25.350]  Oh me and Geoff
[20:25.350 --> 20:26.490]  got this thing right here.
[20:26.990 --> 20:27.690]  And I'm back.
[20:28.730 --> 20:29.970]  Locked in, guys on ground.
[20:30.070 --> 20:30.930]  I used two bullets.
[20:38.760 --> 20:40.380]  You just tuned in, you're watching
[20:40.380 --> 20:42.320]  Eric shoot an endless wave
[20:42.320 --> 20:43.860]  of AI people.
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.980]  The timer on the screen, it reads 49 minutes.
[20:47.080 --> 20:48.000]  We have to get to zero
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.320]  and then we get an achievement.
[20:49.880 --> 20:50.280]  Geoff!
[20:51.600 --> 20:52.320]  What happened?
[20:52.320 --> 20:54.640]  I thought you guys had it.
[20:54.740 --> 20:57.040]  What do you mean? They're on the left.
[20:57.140 --> 20:58.080]  That's your territory.
[20:59.400 --> 21:00.040]  I've killed
[21:00.040 --> 21:02.740]  three dudes in the last five minutes.
[21:02.860 --> 21:03.540]  It was nothing.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.080]  Every time that happens, we get free guns.
[21:06.780 --> 21:06.900]  Alright.
[21:08.040 --> 21:10.920]  I won't look at the fucking chat again for one second.
[21:13.060 --> 21:14.660]  I hadn't fired
[21:14.660 --> 21:16.160]  my gun in three minutes probably.
[21:16.320 --> 21:18.940]  You think the army
[21:18.940 --> 21:19.900]  would let you do that?
[21:19.900 --> 21:21.720]  You think the army would let you check chat?
[21:22.220 --> 21:22.840]  The only time
[21:22.840 --> 21:26.200]  I needed to fire my gun was when Gavin reloaded.
[21:26.740 --> 21:27.720]  That's fucking wild.
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.980]  Anyway, somebody asked what are we going to do
[21:29.980 --> 21:31.780]  when we run out of ammo. I think that's a good question.
[21:32.020 --> 21:34.140]  Spicy Badger. I don't really know.
[21:34.960 --> 21:36.160]  We're going to scavenge it
[21:36.160 --> 21:37.060]  off the bodies.
[21:37.840 --> 21:38.720]  I'm reloading!
[21:41.180 --> 21:44.100]  I could use the drone to try to find
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.240]  his guns maybe.
[21:46.480 --> 21:48.200]  I don't trust you using...
[21:48.200 --> 21:49.820]  Is it like
[21:50.400 --> 21:51.980]  the bot in Gears 5?
[21:52.140 --> 21:53.300]  Can it pick it up and deliver ammo?
[21:54.480 --> 21:55.380]  We should play more of that.
[21:56.560 --> 21:58.160]  Are you going to record it this time?
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.000]  Whoa!
[22:00.320 --> 22:01.600]  I just went down! Hey, I'm dead!
[22:03.400 --> 22:04.280]  I don't know what...
[22:04.280 --> 22:04.900]  I died.
[22:05.640 --> 22:07.960]  I'm talking a little shit about recording Gears
[22:07.960 --> 22:10.000]  and all of a sudden...
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.400]  I don't know what shot me.
[22:11.540 --> 22:13.300]  Nothing was crazy.
[22:15.180 --> 22:15.480]  Wow.
[22:15.480 --> 22:17.720]  Were you about to throw a grenade or something?
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.580]  Because you kind of rolled on my screen.
[22:19.880 --> 22:21.620]  No, just all of a sudden I was dead.
[22:22.460 --> 22:23.980]  I'm going to watch
[22:23.980 --> 22:24.780]  it from Gavin's...
[22:25.520 --> 22:27.440]  Gavin's point of view is just my point of view from
[22:27.840 --> 22:29.000]  three steps back.
[22:30.280 --> 22:31.480]  Andrew is watching
[22:31.480 --> 22:34.000]  a wall. Oh, shit! Geoff, your side!
[22:34.620 --> 22:35.980]  I know. I'm fucking...
[22:35.980 --> 22:37.340]  He looked at the chat, sorry.
[22:37.640 --> 22:39.580]  I'm not looking at the chat, I'm looking at the fucking dead bodies.
[22:39.580 --> 22:40.080]  Time to reload.
[22:44.120 --> 22:45.380]  That is rough.
[22:46.060 --> 22:47.400]  The diamond viewing
[22:48.620 --> 22:49.020]  on...
[22:49.700 --> 22:51.420]  They're all bunched up on Gavin's.
[22:51.600 --> 22:53.520]  When you look at Geoff's, it is
[22:53.520 --> 22:55.600]  a line of diamonds. It's so
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.200]  many. Oh, it's so crazy.
[22:58.140 --> 22:59.600]  Andrew, you can take up my old position.
[23:00.340 --> 23:00.920]  I could.
[23:01.640 --> 23:02.560]  Well, then who's going to have the right?
[23:03.100 --> 23:05.220]  I don't know that anyone's coming from the right, are they?
[23:05.300 --> 23:06.620]  Not right now, but they do spawn.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.060]  Oh, do they later?
[23:09.360 --> 23:10.680]  I think I read that they always
[23:10.680 --> 23:11.880]  come from two places.
[23:13.040 --> 23:14.680]  This is the best
[23:14.680 --> 23:16.640]  we've done since we got the achievement, Gavin.
[23:16.760 --> 23:18.620]  Yeah. I mean, this is pretty good.
[23:20.740 --> 23:22.640]  We got all of Eric's ammo as well.
[23:23.180 --> 23:23.720]  It's true.
[23:24.220 --> 23:24.920]  That is true.
[23:26.260 --> 23:28.680]  I might move up and grab a little bit of that, because I'm on my last clip.
[23:29.300 --> 23:30.320]  Yeah, do it. Oh, you better get that.
[23:31.100 --> 23:32.300]  Geoff's moving up a little bit.
[23:32.700 --> 23:34.600]  Alright, Geoff, can you take
[23:34.600 --> 23:36.620]  up the bipin while I get
[23:36.620 --> 23:38.860]  more ammo? I have 20 bullets. Do you think that's enough?
[23:40.000 --> 23:40.720]  Andrew's right
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.460]  next to you also.
[23:41.680 --> 23:44.400]  Alright, I'm moving.
[23:44.820 --> 23:45.340]  Alright, go.
[23:47.420 --> 23:48.580]  My gun should
[23:48.580 --> 23:50.800]  be right there, Gavin. It should be like right in front of you.
[23:51.120 --> 23:51.860]  No, right to the right.
[23:53.260 --> 23:53.580]  There you go.
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.460]  Jesus Christ. You need to get on the ground.
[23:56.660 --> 23:58.880]  Yeah, you're just like standing in front of Andrew.
[23:59.340 --> 24:00.660]  Alright, that's what the gun was.
[24:01.100 --> 24:01.940]  Alright, I'm getting back down.
[24:01.940 --> 24:03.380]  Alright, Andrew.
[24:04.340 --> 24:06.260]  Reloading, reloading, reloading.
[24:08.220 --> 24:09.920]  Oh shit, so I'm not on single fire.
[24:11.760 --> 24:13.400]  Andrew and Gavin are
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.120]  right on top of each other.
[24:15.520 --> 24:17.660]  Yeah, Andrew, do you want to take over? Yeah, I'll move.
[24:19.940 --> 24:22.080]  I'm a little exposed from behind that.
[24:22.160 --> 24:22.680]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:24.560 --> 24:25.760]  Yep, careful, careful.
[24:25.820 --> 24:26.280]  You're getting bit.
[24:26.840 --> 24:29.760]  How do you roll? I don't know.
[24:29.760 --> 24:32.180]  It tells you that you can, but I don't know how to do it.
[24:37.270 --> 24:39.650]  Gavin just laying siege, dude.
[24:40.870 --> 24:42.130]  How much ammo do you have, Geoff?
[24:43.870 --> 24:44.610]  379 bullets.
[24:45.350 --> 24:45.990]  How about you, Gavin?
[24:47.290 --> 24:48.410]  I've got like 300 bullets.
[24:48.630 --> 24:50.890]  Yeah, they're about the same on ammo.
[24:51.090 --> 24:52.490]  You have more than both.
[24:58.540 --> 25:00.900]  I wonder if I can...
[25:00.900 --> 25:02.800]  You guys got it for a second
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.240]  so I can throw a grenade?
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.400]  Yeah, big time.
[25:06.360 --> 25:07.500]  Erase those diamonds.
[25:07.940 --> 25:10.000]  Last time Geoff did this, everybody died.
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.300]  I mean, just no shot, but yeah,
[25:12.360 --> 25:12.920]  go for it.
[25:13.800 --> 25:15.860]  Get him, Geoff. Yeah, it didn't go.
[25:16.860 --> 25:17.860]  It was a little close.
[25:20.780 --> 25:22.060]  Are you serious?
[25:22.680 --> 25:23.840]  Are you shitsing serious?
[25:24.220 --> 25:24.720]  Come on!
[25:25.300 --> 25:27.440]  I'm not dead, I'm down, you can pick me up.
[25:27.760 --> 25:30.060]  Come on! Yeah, I threw it a little off.
[25:30.180 --> 25:30.760]  It was a little off.
[25:31.560 --> 25:32.520]  We're doing great, though.
[25:33.260 --> 25:34.380]  If you get me back up,
[25:34.420 --> 25:35.740]  I'll throw it better next time.
[25:36.780 --> 25:38.560]  They're waiting to be blown up.
[25:38.960 --> 25:41.140]  That's what needs to happen. Geoff needs to throw his grenade again.
[25:41.500 --> 25:43.160]  Geoff, camera's on you
[25:43.160 --> 25:44.360]  whenever you want to throw that grenade, buddy.
[25:44.460 --> 25:47.200]  He's going to be the most practiced at it. He knows where not to throw it.
[25:47.700 --> 25:47.920]  Uh-huh.
[25:48.240 --> 25:49.680]  You would think that would help him?
[25:50.400 --> 25:52.160]  Oh, what a throw! That's deep.
[25:52.260 --> 25:52.980]  Oh, shit!
[25:53.460 --> 25:56.520]  Oh, you wiped him out, buddy!
[25:56.760 --> 25:57.900]  I don't think I got any, did I?
[25:57.900 --> 25:59.040]  No, you did.
[25:59.100 --> 26:00.220]  You got a bunch of them.
[26:01.640 --> 26:01.880]  Gavin!
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.900]  No, but I wasn't dead!
[26:08.280 --> 26:09.500]  You just finished me off!
[26:09.600 --> 26:10.520]  You could have picked me up!
[26:12.340 --> 26:13.800]  I was bleeding out
[26:13.800 --> 26:14.600]  in front of you!
[26:14.880 --> 26:16.920]  And then you shot me in the face!
[26:17.300 --> 26:18.820]  You ran in front of my gun with no warning.
[26:19.060 --> 26:20.540]  Yeah, but you could have picked me up!
[26:20.840 --> 26:22.120]  I couldn't, there was people there!
[26:22.240 --> 26:24.300]  And then you rolled in agony!
[26:24.300 --> 26:24.780]  I was covered!
[26:25.340 --> 26:27.540]  You didn't have to shoot me in the face!
[26:27.800 --> 26:30.120]  We didn't have time to discuss it!
[26:31.560 --> 26:32.520]  God damn it!
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.120]  Okay, well you got a gun with like
[26:34.120 --> 26:35.140]  500 bullets.
[26:36.180 --> 26:37.800]  You have so many bullets, dude.
[26:38.740 --> 26:39.360]  Oh, shit.
[26:39.760 --> 26:41.780]  Yeah, you want me to?
[26:42.220 --> 26:43.660]  Yeah, clear him out.
[26:44.520 --> 26:44.780]  Alright.
[26:45.680 --> 26:46.560]  Oh, shit.
[26:52.560 --> 26:54.060]  Nice deep toss right there.
[26:54.240 --> 26:55.220]  Oh, I saw that go in.
[26:55.220 --> 26:55.760]  Ow.
[26:56.940 --> 26:57.300]  Oh!
[26:59.220 --> 26:59.800]  Nice, Geoff!
[27:00.360 --> 27:01.520]  That was a good throw, man.
[27:01.980 --> 27:04.760]  I'm on my last legs, I think.
[27:06.140 --> 27:06.480]  Are you?
[27:06.980 --> 27:08.420]  Oh, yeah, you're getting there.
[27:09.160 --> 27:10.200]  You guys are both hurt.
[27:11.540 --> 27:12.420]  Yeah, it's been a rough war.
[27:14.440 --> 27:15.400]  Tell me about it!
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.120]  I've seen a lot of horrors.
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.080]  I saw a lot of men die.
[27:20.500 --> 27:21.220]  It's not my respected.
[27:22.140 --> 27:22.500]  Alright.
[27:22.500 --> 27:22.580]  Alright.
[27:27.070 --> 27:28.070]  Gavin is just
[27:28.660 --> 27:30.510]  destroying these guys right here.
[27:31.070 --> 27:31.910]  Bip, bip, bip,
[27:33.110 --> 27:33.610]  easy.
[27:35.890 --> 27:36.870]  I can't get over
[27:36.870 --> 27:38.710]  the fact that Gavin shot me in the face
[27:38.710 --> 27:39.610]  when I was down.
[27:40.190 --> 27:42.110]  Your face rolled in front of me.
[27:44.490 --> 27:45.610]  Screaming for help.
[27:46.230 --> 27:46.970]  He can't be
[27:46.970 --> 27:49.230]  rolling your face in front of somebody
[27:49.230 --> 27:50.710]  and not expecting to shoot you.
[27:50.910 --> 27:52.810]  Everybody knows that.
[27:53.690 --> 27:54.490]  This guy is dead.
[27:55.230 --> 27:56.530]  He rolled his face in front of me.
[27:56.610 --> 27:57.230]  I didn't have a choice.
[27:59.730 --> 28:00.970]  Who are you camming right now, Eric?
[28:01.430 --> 28:02.530]  I'm watching Geoff.
[28:02.650 --> 28:03.550]  Now I'm watching you.
[28:03.890 --> 28:04.870]  Now I'm watching Geoff.
[28:06.510 --> 28:08.130]  It's just nice to bounce back and forth.
[28:08.230 --> 28:09.070]  See what you guys are doing.
[28:10.070 --> 28:12.430]  I think people got sick of my POV for a while.
[28:12.430 --> 28:12.950]  Oh, Geoff.
[28:14.090 --> 28:15.550]  Geoff, you've let something happen here.
[28:16.330 --> 28:18.010]  You've got to get some of these guys, buddy.
[28:19.510 --> 28:20.970]  They come around that corner
[28:20.970 --> 28:21.630]  with no warning.
[28:21.770 --> 28:23.450]  It's like, surprise!
[28:24.370 --> 28:27.010]  It's hard because I can see where my position was.
[28:27.090 --> 28:28.850]  I can see that stuff.
[28:29.070 --> 28:30.750]  Like where they are, how far they're coming up.
[28:30.970 --> 28:32.490]  But yours, it's all the same depth.
[28:32.870 --> 28:35.170]  I can't tell if they're between the Humvee
[28:35.170 --> 28:36.790]  and the wall or on the other side of it.
[28:36.870 --> 28:39.290]  And if they're on the other side of it, I waste ammo trying to shoot them.
[28:39.670 --> 28:40.970]  And then if they're between, they're like,
[28:41.030 --> 28:41.210]  Hello!
[28:42.250 --> 28:44.170]  This reminds me of the loot cave in Destiny.
[28:46.090 --> 28:46.450]  Yeah.
[28:46.450 --> 28:46.550]  Yeah.
[28:49.330 --> 28:50.690]  Except there's no reprieve
[28:50.690 --> 28:51.790]  to go get all my engrams.
[28:52.230 --> 28:54.370]  Wasted a lot of my life in that fucking loot cave.
[28:59.330 --> 29:00.090]  Where are they?
[29:00.870 --> 29:02.310]  Oh, fuck!
[29:07.890 --> 29:09.370]  I wish I could possess the drone.
[29:09.370 --> 29:10.170]  Someone in the chat said,
[29:10.330 --> 29:13.070]  I like that Eric outright refuses to fix his audio.
[29:13.390 --> 29:15.450]  I asked if it sounded good and looked good
[29:15.450 --> 29:17.330]  and the first responses I got were,
[29:17.590 --> 29:18.990]  I can't hear Nick, haha!
[29:18.990 --> 29:20.270]  And so I just gave up.
[29:20.450 --> 29:22.570]  I don't know what's wrong with it. I hope you love it.
[29:23.990 --> 29:25.090]  What's wrong with Eric's audio?
[29:26.510 --> 29:26.970]  Gavin's dead.
[29:26.990 --> 29:28.490]  It's either too loud or too quiet.
[29:30.230 --> 29:31.130]  Gavin is dead.
[29:31.510 --> 29:31.950]  I died.
[29:33.110 --> 29:33.390]  Oh.
[29:33.630 --> 29:35.550]  It's all on you, Geoff. You got this.
[29:37.810 --> 29:38.570]  Alright, well, here we go.
[29:38.810 --> 29:39.450]  A little quiet, it seems.
[29:39.870 --> 29:41.270]  Oh, get a grenade, Geoff. Look at that.
[29:41.510 --> 29:42.490]  That's gonna be amazing.
[29:45.170 --> 29:46.570]  When I get a chance,
[29:46.570 --> 29:48.250]  there's not gonna be a
[29:48.250 --> 29:49.790]  grenade break for a minute.
[29:50.190 --> 29:50.670]  You're good!
[29:54.730 --> 29:55.530]  God damn it.
[29:55.810 --> 29:57.010]  Oh, just in time.
[30:02.530 --> 30:03.410]  Good lord.
[30:03.710 --> 30:05.210]  That guy ran us so close.
[30:05.430 --> 30:06.450]  How far did we do, though?
[30:07.030 --> 30:08.850]  19 minutes, 40, almost 20.
[30:09.530 --> 30:11.810]  Are we sure that this is the best level?
[30:13.070 --> 30:14.090]  Gavin read the internet.
[30:14.310 --> 30:16.250]  I thought that we read that it was, didn't we?
[30:16.250 --> 30:17.790]  Uh, no.
[30:18.130 --> 30:19.250]  That's what the thing told me.
[30:20.130 --> 30:22.510]  Hey, we got 500 kills, almost.
[30:23.890 --> 30:24.350]  Yeah, but you were
[30:24.350 --> 30:25.350]  360 of them.
[30:25.530 --> 30:26.210]  Yeah, no kidding.
[30:30.070 --> 30:31.070]  Alright, let's try and live.
[30:31.350 --> 30:32.810]  Let's try to make it to 50 minutes.
[30:37.300 --> 30:38.600]  If you like
[30:38.600 --> 30:40.380]  what you're seeing so far, thanks for being here
[30:40.380 --> 30:41.860]  every Friday at 4pm.
[30:43.600 --> 30:44.680]  It's always fun
[30:44.680 --> 30:46.460]  to do these streams. And then for the VOD
[30:46.460 --> 30:48.040]  I wanted to go up later so you can rewatch it
[30:48.040 --> 30:49.540]  and you go, why did that person do that?
[30:49.640 --> 30:53.140]  It's always great to see the comments later.
[30:53.360 --> 30:54.180]  What's over here?
[30:54.600 --> 30:55.740]  Is there like a single shot?
[30:56.400 --> 30:58.380]  Does someone else want to do the Biffin?
[30:58.520 --> 31:00.380]  You're streaming, you want to do the Biffin first this time?
[31:00.400 --> 31:01.260]  No, you're good.
[31:01.520 --> 31:02.780]  You're so good at it.
[31:04.060 --> 31:05.620]  I appreciate it, Gavin.
[31:05.760 --> 31:06.480]  You're good.
[31:07.800 --> 31:10.540]  Is my spot the best spot?
[31:10.680 --> 31:11.800]  I don't think so.
[31:12.000 --> 31:12.620]  I don't either.
[31:12.620 --> 31:14.420]  I feel like I'm...
[31:14.420 --> 31:16.860]  You can try the right side
[31:16.860 --> 31:18.500]  but no one's going to like that right side.
[31:18.620 --> 31:20.340]  Nobody really goes over this way, right, Andrew?
[31:21.480 --> 31:22.540]  Occasionally they do, but
[31:22.540 --> 31:23.920]  yeah, it's not frequent.
[31:24.860 --> 31:26.680]  I wonder if it all bunched up on that side.
[31:26.760 --> 31:28.440]  Oh, because they're going to capture the zone, aren't they?
[31:28.880 --> 31:30.660]  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, because this is the zone.
[31:32.060 --> 31:32.460]  Oops.
[31:34.360 --> 31:34.660]  Okay.
[31:35.380 --> 31:36.380]  Accuracy at zero.
[31:46.190 --> 31:47.250]  It's sort of a weird thing
[31:47.250 --> 31:49.010]  where we need to keep them back
[31:49.010 --> 31:50.590]  but killing them doesn't mean anything
[31:50.590 --> 31:51.630]  because they just keep coming.
[31:52.530 --> 31:54.590]  So it's almost like you want to endure
[31:54.590 --> 31:56.870]  as much as you can for ammo.
[31:57.070 --> 31:58.850]  If we could make a wall
[31:59.250 --> 32:00.870]  stacking the bodies, that would be cool.
[32:02.470 --> 32:03.550]  Like if we could pick them up
[32:03.550 --> 32:04.350]  and hit them.
[32:09.800 --> 32:10.680]  I think you should be able
[32:10.680 --> 32:12.200]  to pick up bodies in every video game.
[32:12.560 --> 32:14.600]  I agree. Totally agree.
[32:14.740 --> 32:16.280]  Yeah, there are not a lot of games where you can.
[32:18.140 --> 32:18.800]  What was that we were playing
[32:18.800 --> 32:21.220]  the other day where somebody picked a person up?
[32:22.780 --> 32:24.900]  That's why I like Hitman and Splinter Cell
[32:24.900 --> 32:25.380]  so much.
[32:26.480 --> 32:28.780]  Splinter Cell is a good one. Tossing bodies
[32:28.780 --> 32:29.360]  left and right.
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.280]  I feel like other games need it.
[32:32.680 --> 32:34.140]  I agree. Animal Crossing.
[32:37.620 --> 32:38.980]  You want to be able to drag
[32:38.980 --> 32:40.040]  an animal across the beach?
[32:40.780 --> 32:41.900]  This fucking raccoon.
[32:43.120 --> 32:44.420]  Pay my bill!
[32:44.580 --> 32:45.120]  Get in the water.
[32:50.910 --> 32:51.530]  Sucks though
[32:51.530 --> 32:53.330]  because it takes two real time days
[32:53.330 --> 32:54.050]  to move the morgue.
[32:57.650 --> 32:59.090]  Set up the turnip shop
[32:59.090 --> 33:00.830]  right above where you buried the body.
[33:01.930 --> 33:02.730]  Sweating it out.
[33:03.290 --> 33:04.970]  I've got no angle on anybody
[33:04.970 --> 33:07.070]  from this, which may be fine.
[33:07.610 --> 33:08.530]  You could get a grenade involved.
[33:09.970 --> 33:11.010]  I mean, Geoff,
[33:11.070 --> 33:12.950]  you can keep scouting out a different position if you think.
[33:13.170 --> 33:15.210]  I think I'll hold on to the grenades
[33:15.210 --> 33:16.150]  for later.
[33:16.150 --> 33:17.630]  Like Andrew said,
[33:17.690 --> 33:18.470]  it doesn't do us any good.
[33:20.590 --> 33:21.310]  Jesus Christ.
[33:21.730 --> 33:22.310]  Where did that guy come from?
[33:24.770 --> 33:26.190]  You can keep scoping it out.
[33:26.250 --> 33:27.510]  You might find a better spot.
[33:27.810 --> 33:30.110]  I just don't think we ever really
[33:30.110 --> 33:31.550]  looked. I think we kind of
[33:32.050 --> 33:33.250]  hunkered down and found spots
[33:33.250 --> 33:34.790]  when we tried this.
[33:35.750 --> 33:37.050]  I just don't want to be a nick.
[33:38.070 --> 33:39.670]  I'm coming behind you, Andrew.
[33:40.090 --> 33:41.050]  I'm going to go around the side.
[33:42.350 --> 33:42.910]  Mark226 says,
[33:43.150 --> 33:43.470]  favorite Hitman?
[33:43.650 --> 33:46.050]  I liked Chaos Theory a lot.
[33:46.430 --> 33:48.310]  You can't stick to walls in this game, can you?
[33:48.550 --> 33:50.670]  No, you can't.
[33:50.950 --> 33:52.790]  I was trying to do that, and I just kept shooting
[33:52.790 --> 33:54.310]  the walls, so I was like, yeah.
[33:54.630 --> 33:55.730]  Alright, here we go.
[33:56.110 --> 33:58.830]  Hitman, probably the most recent trilogy was my fave.
[34:00.170 --> 34:00.690]  Out of all of them?
[34:00.690 --> 34:01.090]  It's a good one.
[34:01.670 --> 34:04.150]  Got a soft spot for Hitman 1. It's jank as shit,
[34:04.310 --> 34:06.350]  but it's a good game at the time.
[34:06.930 --> 34:07.150]  Right.
[34:07.150 --> 34:09.130]  I think it was the
[34:09.130 --> 34:10.410]  first time I ever saw Ragdoll.
[34:14.520 --> 34:15.320]  You said that
[34:15.320 --> 34:16.400]  like it was the Babadook.
[34:16.900 --> 34:19.040]  I didn't know what he meant, so I didn't say anything,
[34:19.220 --> 34:21.400]  but I thought maybe it was like a Raggedy Ann thing.
[34:22.180 --> 34:23.000]  No, like the physics.
[34:24.040 --> 34:24.580]  Got it.
[34:29.190 --> 34:29.970]  I shot that guy
[34:29.970 --> 34:30.730]  in the gun.
[34:31.650 --> 34:32.910]  You shot his gun?
[34:33.430 --> 34:35.230]  Yeah, but it didn't do anything. I just
[34:35.710 --> 34:37.150]  shot him, and I went, nothing happened.
[34:37.470 --> 34:38.490]  I shot his gun.
[34:40.270 --> 34:40.630]  Oh!
[34:40.930 --> 34:41.770]  What the fuck?
[34:42.770 --> 34:44.310]  Some guy stood up out of nowhere.
[34:44.410 --> 34:45.470]  I guess they're like laying down.
[34:45.690 --> 34:48.390]  It scared the shit out of me last time.
[34:48.570 --> 34:50.270]  I think that's fine, though, because if they're lying down,
[34:50.350 --> 34:51.990]  they're not shooting at us.
[34:52.290 --> 34:53.330]  Yeah, like they can't see us.
[34:54.110 --> 34:54.410]  Yeah.
[34:57.830 --> 34:58.570]  We were talking
[34:58.570 --> 35:00.170]  about it when we were trying it originally,
[35:00.350 --> 35:02.510]  where it's like, oh, this is like 360 AI,
[35:02.650 --> 35:04.390]  so I'm not expecting anything like tricky or whatever.
[35:04.690 --> 35:06.510]  And then you were saying like, you never know,
[35:06.510 --> 35:07.470]  because it's just,
[35:08.270 --> 35:10.630]  it could suddenly become a totally
[35:10.630 --> 35:11.810]  weird, different thing.
[35:12.530 --> 35:14.290]  Because it is jank-ass AI.
[35:14.510 --> 35:16.490]  Yeah, sometimes old AI is the most bullshit.
[35:17.110 --> 35:17.310]  Yeah.
[35:19.490 --> 35:19.970]  Reloading.
[35:20.290 --> 35:21.950]  Call of Duty World at War, I'm
[35:22.450 --> 35:24.050]  looking at you. Oh, yeah.
[35:24.610 --> 35:26.770]  They just infinitely spawn in that one,
[35:26.790 --> 35:27.710]  right? Yeah.
[35:28.330 --> 35:30.550]  Spawning grenades inside
[35:30.550 --> 35:32.550]  of fucking bunkers when you're already
[35:32.550 --> 35:34.510]  in there. Holy shit. Looking at the only
[35:34.510 --> 35:36.470]  door. Like, how the fuck did he get behind me?
[35:37.030 --> 35:38.590]  Should we do a video? Top 10 most
[35:38.590 --> 35:39.790]  bullshit moments in games?
[35:51.420 --> 35:53.640]  Sounds like there's a lot of fighting going on over there.
[35:54.680 --> 35:55.400]  How you guys
[35:55.400 --> 35:55.640]  doing?
[35:57.240 --> 35:59.420]  Empty pathway. I've used three
[35:59.420 --> 36:01.360]  bullets. Nice. I haven't fired
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.200]  yet. I'm clicking diamonds.
[36:05.040 --> 36:05.420]  I think I have
[36:05.420 --> 36:07.540]  an adequate amount of diamonds or too many
[36:07.540 --> 36:07.880]  diamonds?
[36:10.220 --> 36:10.860]  Good amount.
[36:10.860 --> 36:11.600]  Good amount.
[36:14.640 --> 36:16.120]  Andrew, what was your favorite Hitman?
[36:19.580 --> 36:20.920]  Hitman Blood Money at the
[36:20.920 --> 36:22.920]  time. Blood Money at the time?
[36:23.020 --> 36:25.020]  Unbelievable. Blood Money now? Jank.
[36:25.260 --> 36:26.720]  Yeah, it really hasn't
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.860]  aged great mechanically. It's really
[36:28.860 --> 36:30.680]  hard to go back to the older
[36:30.680 --> 36:32.720]  Hitman games after the most recent trilogy
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.760]  because so many just
[36:34.760 --> 36:36.900]  user-friendly UI type things.
[36:37.900 --> 36:38.820]  Is that what they did
[36:38.820 --> 36:39.680]  with the newer ones?
[36:42.120 --> 36:42.840]  In the
[36:42.840 --> 36:45.040]  previous to the most recent trilogy
[36:45.040 --> 36:46.880]  you had to just stand
[36:46.880 --> 36:48.860]  in places and try to figure out what
[36:48.860 --> 36:50.640]  was going on. I didn't mind that though.
[36:51.440 --> 36:52.080]  It's fine.
[36:53.000 --> 36:53.860]  Where did this guy come from?
[36:54.420 --> 36:55.920]  I got him.
[36:56.280 --> 36:58.640]  I got him. Just all of a sudden
[36:58.640 --> 37:00.620]  there was a guy laying down. I killed him and then a guy
[37:00.620 --> 37:02.700]  just went, I'm going for it! And I just killed him.
[37:03.640 --> 37:04.660]  It's like playing with Nick
[37:04.660 --> 37:06.200]  when he wants to go help Andrew.
[37:11.380 --> 37:11.820]  Woo!
[37:12.380 --> 37:13.260]  Son of a bitch.
[37:13.360 --> 37:13.960]  That got interesting.
[37:14.320 --> 37:16.740]  He like risky business slid
[37:16.740 --> 37:18.840]  into my zone. I'm reloading.
[37:19.440 --> 37:20.700]  Okay, I'm back. I got it.
[37:22.440 --> 37:22.980]  Did you
[37:22.980 --> 37:24.060]  reload or did you change guns?
[37:24.620 --> 37:26.500]  Reloaded. Sneaks up on you sometimes.
[37:27.040 --> 37:27.480]  Yeah, it does.
[37:31.200 --> 37:32.340]  Won't be sneaking up on me
[37:32.340 --> 37:32.840]  anytime soon.
[37:36.530 --> 37:38.170]  I wonder if there's an achievement in this game
[37:38.170 --> 37:39.410]  like a seriously
[37:39.410 --> 37:41.250]  kind of
[37:41.250 --> 37:42.770]  shoot a billion people.
[37:42.830 --> 37:45.250]  I don't think so. I think I've got almost all
[37:45.250 --> 37:45.750]  the achievements.
[37:46.950 --> 37:49.270]  God damn, do you remember the Grow 1 achievement
[37:49.270 --> 37:51.270]  where you had to rank on the leaderboard?
[37:51.510 --> 37:52.750]  Global leaderboards?
[37:52.950 --> 37:54.430]  Why number one in the world?
[37:55.090 --> 37:56.670]  Top 10 bullshit.
[37:57.710 --> 37:58.850]  I think it's still a
[37:59.410 --> 38:00.810]  leaderboard still alive, isn't it?
[38:00.910 --> 38:03.410]  Is it? I don't know. But you have to get
[38:03.410 --> 38:05.290]  like 5,000 hours of gameplay
[38:05.290 --> 38:07.290]  to do it or something. Has the world been taking
[38:07.290 --> 38:09.330]  it in turns or is there just one guy who refuses
[38:09.330 --> 38:11.330]  to get off the leaderboard? The world has been taking it
[38:11.330 --> 38:13.270]  in turns, which I think is even funnier. There's like
[38:13.270 --> 38:14.650]  a guide of how to do it
[38:15.150 --> 38:17.010]  and it just progressively gets longer.
[38:17.330 --> 38:19.370]  I love where at the point now
[38:19.370 --> 38:21.190]  you can get an achievement that's like 20
[38:21.190 --> 38:22.910]  whole years after your last achievement.
[38:23.310 --> 38:23.670]  Crazy.
[38:25.530 --> 38:26.610]  Well, 19 I guess.
[38:28.370 --> 38:28.930]  Getting there.
[38:30.370 --> 38:31.050]  Oh, Andrew killed one!
[38:31.470 --> 38:33.310]  I've killed a few. Yeah, they're starting to
[38:33.310 --> 38:35.210]  push in. Do they think you're on the drone?
[38:35.690 --> 38:36.790]  They do, yeah.
[38:37.010 --> 38:39.210]  Like, let's get them. This guy's looking at the
[38:39.210 --> 38:41.090]  fucking drone! We gotta get him! He's editing
[38:41.090 --> 38:41.890]  the feed!
[38:44.170 --> 38:45.330]  He's putting piss rats
[38:45.330 --> 38:46.570]  in the chat! Let's get him!
[38:53.150 --> 38:54.350]  Uh oh. Someone
[38:54.350 --> 38:56.510]  dropped something. No, it's my phone
[38:56.510 --> 38:58.490]  could not be... I, like, as soon as I
[38:58.490 --> 38:59.730]  start doing anything,
[39:00.390 --> 39:02.230]  people are just like, hey!
[39:02.690 --> 39:04.530]  I'm texting you out of nowhere. We don't
[39:04.530 --> 39:06.610]  usually talk. I decided that right
[39:06.610 --> 39:08.290]  now is the right time. It happens
[39:08.290 --> 39:10.590]  every day. It, I don't know,
[39:10.670 --> 39:12.230]  my luck with, like,
[39:12.430 --> 39:14.530]  you appear to be busy. Hey, someone you haven't
[39:14.530 --> 39:16.350]  spoken to since, like,
[39:16.390 --> 39:18.490]  last decade wants to connect.
[39:18.770 --> 39:19.710]  It's like, I, what?
[39:21.910 --> 39:22.570]  You're never
[39:22.570 --> 39:24.330]  more annoyed at people talking to you than
[39:24.830 --> 39:26.370]  pretty much every time we record.
[39:26.630 --> 39:28.570]  It's just, like, I'm trying to, like,
[39:28.590 --> 39:30.250]  lock in here and my phone just
[39:31.490 --> 39:32.730]  and it's like...
[39:32.730 --> 39:33.990]  Have less companies.
[39:35.510 --> 39:35.910]  Yeah,
[39:35.990 --> 39:37.970]  let's get going. It's,
[39:37.970 --> 39:40.010]  none of it's, none of it is other job.
[39:40.450 --> 39:41.550]  All of it is,
[39:41.730 --> 39:42.930]  hey, I got an idea.
[39:43.750 --> 39:46.090]  Oh, okay. I don't talk to you.
[39:46.230 --> 39:47.070]  What are you talking about?
[39:47.570 --> 39:48.850]  An old friend from Razor.
[39:50.170 --> 39:51.650]  You should just be like, here's an idea,
[39:51.810 --> 39:52.950]  lose this number. Yeah.
[39:55.290 --> 39:55.990]  Just texted
[39:55.990 --> 39:57.030]  back, do you have ammo?
[39:59.610 --> 40:00.010]  Gavin,
[40:00.050 --> 40:00.730]  how you doing on bullets?
[40:01.190 --> 40:02.450]  I got about 150.
[40:02.810 --> 40:04.350]  Okay, I got 5 more to reload.
[40:04.690 --> 40:05.950]  4 more to reload. Almost there.
[40:06.230 --> 40:08.610]  What if instead of texting people
[40:08.610 --> 40:10.790]  being like, hey, this is my new number, just text people
[40:10.790 --> 40:12.850]  saying, hey, I'm leaving this number.
[40:13.330 --> 40:13.450]  Yeah.
[40:14.490 --> 40:15.970]  Don't ever text me again.
[40:16.930 --> 40:18.490]  Alright, I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna throw a grenade
[40:18.490 --> 40:20.290]  over this thing. You gonna give it a shot?
[40:20.590 --> 40:21.170]  Do it.
[40:25.960 --> 40:27.040]  Is it out?
[40:27.660 --> 40:28.500]  It's going out.
[40:32.300 --> 40:33.600]  Oh, that guy's dick got pummeled.
[40:33.600 --> 40:34.420]  Whoa!
[40:36.020 --> 40:36.900]  Good throw!
[40:37.100 --> 40:40.040]  He cleared off a good, like, 5 diamonds there.
[40:43.160 --> 40:45.180]  I'm in the diamond reduction business.
[40:49.960 --> 40:52.100]  Guys, we only have 50 minutes left.
[40:52.280 --> 40:54.140]  Oh, we're fucking killing it.
[40:54.560 --> 40:55.900]  Yep. Take that, Nick.
[40:56.400 --> 40:57.840]  They're pissed about that grenade.
[40:59.320 --> 41:01.580]  Why can't I kill this? What is going on?
[41:02.060 --> 41:04.020]  You guys are gonna be so happy when you have the same
[41:04.020 --> 41:06.080]  achievement Gavin and I have from 17 years ago.
[41:06.080 --> 41:06.440]  Oh, I can't wait.
[41:07.260 --> 41:10.020]  I think it's because I'm...
[41:10.820 --> 41:11.840]  Ooh, they're kind of
[41:11.840 --> 41:13.920]  peeking in here. Look at this.
[41:14.140 --> 41:15.480]  Geoff, how old were you in 2007?
[41:16.860 --> 41:18.380]  Uh, what was that? 14 years ago?
[41:18.900 --> 41:19.140]  32?
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.880]  34? 35?
[41:21.480 --> 41:22.140]  35, yeah.
[41:24.200 --> 41:24.920]  I know.
[41:25.840 --> 41:26.520]  So young and full of life.
[41:26.520 --> 41:29.540]  I'm not allowed to get this achievement until I get that age.
[41:31.980 --> 41:33.280]  I need to wait
[41:33.280 --> 41:34.520]  until I reach Geoff's
[41:34.520 --> 41:35.040]  unlockage.
[41:36.840 --> 41:38.340]  How old were you, Gavin?
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.120]  Like, 19?
[41:40.400 --> 41:41.940]  How would you be 35?
[41:42.800 --> 41:44.780]  Well, it was 14 years ago and I'm 49 now.
[41:45.340 --> 41:46.920]  Okay, I still don't understand.
[41:47.400 --> 41:48.360]  Oh, 17 years ago.
[41:48.460 --> 41:49.880]  Oh, okay. Well, then I was 32.
[41:51.540 --> 41:52.940]  Shit, that's closer for me.
[41:53.740 --> 41:54.760]  You're almost there, Andrew.
[41:54.900 --> 41:55.960]  I'm almost there. I can get there.
[41:56.320 --> 41:57.080]  I'm overdue.
[41:57.080 --> 41:57.120]  I'm overdue.
[42:00.460 --> 42:01.100]  These two
[42:01.100 --> 42:03.120]  guys on the left, Gavin, are about to try
[42:03.120 --> 42:03.780]  to be sneaky.
[42:04.500 --> 42:07.140]  I got eyes on them, don't worry. Oh, I don't have eyes on them, but I have
[42:07.140 --> 42:08.720]  sights on what they're gonna be.
[42:08.720 --> 42:09.920]  I have 62 bullets left.
[42:10.300 --> 42:12.900]  62 bullets, period?
[42:13.620 --> 42:14.720]  58 bullets, period.
[42:15.020 --> 42:17.320]  Oh my god. What are you gonna do?
[42:18.720 --> 42:19.080]  Uh...
[42:19.080 --> 42:20.760]  Do we need to let a couple guys come in?
[42:20.940 --> 42:22.820]  I think we'll call for a Geoff grenade
[42:22.820 --> 42:24.860]  and I'll just run out there and do some shopping.
[42:24.860 --> 42:26.780]  That is a fucking
[42:26.780 --> 42:28.880]  good idea, dude.
[42:29.160 --> 42:30.020]  Let me know when.
[42:30.760 --> 42:32.240]  I can take up your position.
[42:32.860 --> 42:34.240]  When you got about
[42:35.940 --> 42:36.980]  15 left,
[42:37.280 --> 42:38.400]  I can take up your position
[42:38.400 --> 42:40.580]  and we'll switch. You can start moving up
[42:40.580 --> 42:41.880]  and we'll go from there.
[42:45.520 --> 42:46.780]  I'll try to draw fire
[42:46.780 --> 42:47.460]  when you do that.
[42:50.560 --> 42:51.080]  15.
[42:51.560 --> 42:52.180]  Alright, let's switch.
[42:53.420 --> 42:54.020]  Get up.
[43:01.610 --> 43:02.150]  I'm dead.
[43:02.470 --> 43:02.790]  Alright.
[43:04.130 --> 43:05.110]  That was a grenade.
[43:05.470 --> 43:06.610]  I got wiped out. I'm dead.
[43:06.850 --> 43:09.330]  The second grenade, just for the hell of it.
[43:09.750 --> 43:10.230]  Alright, I'm going out.
[43:10.330 --> 43:12.230]  A guy just came in and got me. Sorry.
[43:13.590 --> 43:14.550]  You see him right there, Gavin?
[43:15.750 --> 43:17.450]  Oh, and I got new ammo as well.
[43:17.510 --> 43:18.250]  I got away with that.
[43:18.810 --> 43:19.890]  Oh, you can take my gun.
[43:20.670 --> 43:21.130]  That's true.
[43:23.430 --> 43:25.270]  I mean, Eric died, but I felt like that went
[43:25.270 --> 43:26.490]  really well outside of that.
[43:26.490 --> 43:28.810]  I thought I had that,
[43:28.950 --> 43:31.050]  but it just happens fast.
[43:31.710 --> 43:32.570]  I know. Sorry.
[43:32.750 --> 43:32.990]  Sudden.
[43:34.010 --> 43:36.670]  Andrew, why don't you go up to that opening?
[43:36.830 --> 43:37.810]  Isn't there an opening over here?
[43:37.930 --> 43:40.090]  I could, but what's the point?
[43:40.670 --> 43:42.850]  Oh, I don't know. I've never seen this over here.
[43:42.850 --> 43:43.250]  What do you mean?
[43:43.730 --> 43:46.830]  I can shoot at them, but they just keep coming.
[43:46.990 --> 43:47.490]  What's the point?
[43:48.110 --> 43:49.270]  We don't need me to do that.
[43:50.230 --> 43:50.590]  That's true.
[43:52.970 --> 43:54.430]  You can take my old position.
[43:54.430 --> 43:56.350]  Someone has to watch the right, I guess.
[43:56.830 --> 43:57.970]  You died immediately.
[43:58.650 --> 44:00.910]  Yeah, dude, I moved back
[44:00.910 --> 44:02.070]  and then all of a sudden it was like,
[44:02.130 --> 44:03.670]  ooh, dang.
[44:04.750 --> 44:05.430]  Just happened quick.
[44:09.030 --> 44:10.450]  Well, you have time for your text now.
[44:11.390 --> 44:11.990]  Oh, yeah.
[44:12.090 --> 44:14.090]  I immediately opened my phone and just started looking
[44:14.090 --> 44:15.610]  and none of them are important.
[44:16.470 --> 44:17.190]  You can re-chat.
[44:18.150 --> 44:19.510]  Why would I do that?
[44:21.030 --> 44:22.650]  People are asking good questions.
[44:23.970 --> 44:24.330]  Again,
[44:24.510 --> 44:25.970]  you seem to be finding all of them.
[44:26.870 --> 44:28.130]  He's checking on the Padre score.
[44:28.250 --> 44:29.230]  That's not until 7, I think.
[44:29.370 --> 44:30.230]  Yeah, the game doesn't start until 7.
[44:32.210 --> 44:33.490]  7.05 kickoff, maybe.
[44:33.930 --> 44:35.630]  What a wild series it's been.
[44:39.220 --> 44:40.020]  Yeah, it's really been
[44:40.020 --> 44:40.560]  back and forth.
[44:43.180 --> 44:44.260]  Really want to win it,
[44:44.340 --> 44:46.040]  but also to make it
[44:46.040 --> 44:47.800]  this far with this team that we didn't think
[44:47.800 --> 44:49.600]  was going to be anything is really impressive.
[44:50.060 --> 44:50.900]  It's been fun to watch.
[44:52.280 --> 44:53.100]  It's been fun to watch
[44:53.100 --> 44:54.880]  Manny Machado be very fucking good.
[44:55.620 --> 44:56.860]  Dude, you're talking about...
[44:57.360 --> 44:58.820]  Machado, you see Tati said
[44:58.820 --> 45:00.600]  an OPS of 2.
[45:01.220 --> 45:02.020]  That's insane.
[45:02.580 --> 45:04.420]  And they're playing at Dodgers Stadium tonight,
[45:04.540 --> 45:06.160]  so I do hope that he hits two more home runs
[45:06.160 --> 45:08.640]  because he goes insane at Petco Park North.
[45:09.660 --> 45:10.240]  Peek-a-Pop?
[45:18.280 --> 45:19.660]  Whoa, that bullet almost got you.
[45:20.060 --> 45:21.340]  Gavin, you got it close to reload.
[45:22.460 --> 45:23.500]  About to reload.
[45:23.860 --> 45:24.260]  Okay.
[45:25.420 --> 45:27.260]  Andrew's locked in. I'm locked in.
[45:27.460 --> 45:29.540]  I'm thinking about Peek-a-Park baseball.
[45:29.960 --> 45:31.000]  I'm locked in, but I don't have an angle.
[45:31.700 --> 45:33.480]  Why don't you move up to my old spot,
[45:33.780 --> 45:34.960]  Geoff? I can do that.
[45:35.880 --> 45:37.380]  I can do that whenever Gavin's done
[45:37.820 --> 45:38.880]  reloading. I'm done reloading. He's done?
[45:39.220 --> 45:41.660]  Yeah, you're good. Just call it out when you're about to run across me.
[45:42.300 --> 45:43.500]  No, no, it's not going to be
[45:43.500 --> 45:45.160]  across. You're going to be to his right and up a little bit.
[45:45.160 --> 45:46.020]  I'm crawling.
[45:48.520 --> 45:49.540]  Watching a baseball
[45:49.540 --> 45:51.540]  game where all of the players are connected
[45:51.540 --> 45:53.180]  to each other on each team
[45:53.180 --> 45:54.760]  would be hilarious.
[45:55.240 --> 45:56.980]  Big bungee cord baseball.
[45:57.300 --> 45:59.000]  Having to have like
[45:59.440 --> 46:01.220]  10 guys run to first base
[46:01.220 --> 46:03.180]  simultaneously. Oh shit, Geoff, someone got in.
[46:04.360 --> 46:04.700]  He's dead.
[46:05.240 --> 46:05.760]  No, he's not.
[46:07.120 --> 46:08.380]  I shot him.
[46:09.060 --> 46:10.000]  He didn't die.
[46:10.460 --> 46:11.780]  Say he's dead after he's dead.
[46:12.420 --> 46:15.620]  It helps, Geoff, if you're looking down the sights and you look over your other shoulder.
[46:16.200 --> 46:16.800]  Yeah, I got it.
[46:16.800 --> 46:17.680]  Your left shoulder.
[46:20.520 --> 46:21.360]  Sneaky bastard.
[46:23.420 --> 46:23.940]  Oof.
[46:32.030 --> 46:33.030]  I wonder how efficient
[46:33.030 --> 46:35.090]  our pistols are at killing things.
[46:36.290 --> 46:37.030]  I bet it's pretty
[46:37.030 --> 46:37.590]  low.
[46:39.210 --> 46:40.110]  You can try.
[46:41.710 --> 46:42.690]  I guess maybe I could.
[46:43.070 --> 46:44.350]  I'm going to try.
[46:44.790 --> 46:45.490]  How are you doing, Geoff?
[46:46.130 --> 46:47.450]  Pretty good. I'm locked in.
[46:47.750 --> 46:50.150]  I'm shooting the back of this truck a lot.
[46:50.150 --> 46:52.090]  But I'm also...
[46:52.090 --> 46:52.810]  They were good.
[46:54.390 --> 46:56.290]  Oh, look at this. Geoff and Gavin
[46:56.290 --> 46:57.130]  together again.
[46:58.010 --> 46:59.430]  Oh, that was a nit grenade.
[47:00.010 --> 47:01.050]  Was that yours?
[47:01.710 --> 47:03.270]  No, they threw that.
[47:03.850 --> 47:04.650]  Did they really?
[47:04.890 --> 47:07.530]  Yeah, I whipped them with the pistol, went back, and they threw it.
[47:08.690 --> 47:10.150]  Oh, now they're getting crazy.
[47:10.890 --> 47:11.910]  It's starting to...
[47:11.910 --> 47:13.870]  So they start bringing out RPGs eventually.
[47:17.170 --> 47:18.350]  Hey, does anyone in chat
[47:18.350 --> 47:19.930]  know a good way to get more ammo?
[47:21.570 --> 47:22.370]  If anyone was
[47:22.370 --> 47:23.670]  alive when this game was out.
[47:25.290 --> 47:26.450]  Do four people in the
[47:26.450 --> 47:27.590]  chat want to come be dead?
[47:34.220 --> 47:35.220]  Oh, a little break.
[47:35.480 --> 47:36.240]  A little reprieve.
[47:36.480 --> 47:38.760]  Just a little bit of time there.
[47:40.140 --> 47:40.880]  Yeah, you need to reload.
[47:41.500 --> 47:41.860]  Reloading.
[47:45.820 --> 47:46.080]  Oops.
[47:50.160 --> 47:51.220]  I need to reload as well.
[47:55.130 --> 47:55.530]  Reloading.
[47:55.530 --> 47:56.630]  There's a freaking guy.
[48:05.550 --> 48:06.410]  Getting fired up.
[48:09.150 --> 48:09.870]  Nice shot!
[48:10.390 --> 48:11.690]  Guys at the same time, that was cool.
[48:15.790 --> 48:16.250]  Yeah, they
[48:16.250 --> 48:17.730]  got killed by the power of friendship.
[48:20.770 --> 48:22.270]  I've killed so many people, it's gotta be
[48:22.270 --> 48:23.230]  a war crime at this point.
[48:24.630 --> 48:26.390]  I looked at the chat for the first time,
[48:26.750 --> 48:28.050]  so I don't read it.
[48:28.110 --> 48:29.850]  One person. Is the objective to survive
[48:30.370 --> 48:31.730]  for those 43 minutes?
[48:31.730 --> 48:32.570]  Yeah.
[48:36.170 --> 48:37.930]  The achievement is called
[48:37.930 --> 48:38.930]  Ultimate Defender.
[48:39.350 --> 48:41.930]  What the fuck is going on?
[48:42.430 --> 48:43.330]  Power of friendship.
[48:43.330 --> 48:44.810]  I think Andrew's done something.
[48:45.090 --> 48:47.810]  The three fucking
[48:47.810 --> 48:48.950]  stooges.
[48:49.990 --> 48:51.770]  Someone's wrecking my camera.
[48:51.830 --> 48:52.750]  Are you climbing on me?
[48:53.390 --> 48:55.210]  Power of friendship.
[48:55.970 --> 48:57.950]  You were like squashing my camera
[48:57.950 --> 48:58.650]  into the ground.
[48:58.650 --> 49:00.770]  Yes, that was really something.
[49:01.110 --> 49:02.630]  He was stacking. He was girdling the
[49:02.630 --> 49:04.430]  turtle in this whole fucking game, dude.
[49:04.990 --> 49:05.890]  How do I roll?
[49:07.330 --> 49:08.410]  Oh, I got it.
[49:08.450 --> 49:10.190]  I figured it out. What button is it?
[49:10.470 --> 49:11.930]  One sec. There's a guy in.
[49:12.550 --> 49:13.470]  Someone get him.
[49:14.290 --> 49:15.810]  Geoff got him. Nice.
[49:16.570 --> 49:17.590]  Alright, are you action rolling?
[49:20.090 --> 49:22.150]  You better tell us what that roll button is.
[49:22.470 --> 49:23.570]  The power of friendship.
[49:24.410 --> 49:26.570]  Getting my friendship all over this place.
[49:26.570 --> 49:28.990]  Stop wiping your
[49:28.990 --> 49:31.070]  friendship on my back and get some kill.
[49:31.310 --> 49:32.570]  This is what my dog does when
[49:32.570 --> 49:35.070]  something stinks outside and he wants to get all over him.
[49:37.250 --> 49:38.710]  What's the button for that, Andrew?
[49:38.850 --> 49:39.470]  Y, click Y.
[49:44.460 --> 49:46.880]  Y is like the catch all button for anything
[49:46.880 --> 49:48.080]  in this game, it feels like.
[49:51.580 --> 49:52.680]  I have not been coming.
[49:53.860 --> 49:54.780]  GTA, you hit Y.
[49:55.220 --> 49:56.940]  Andrew's gonna get shot.
[49:56.940 --> 49:59.180]  The power of friendship, I trust you guys.
[49:59.300 --> 50:00.020]  It's a trust circle.
[50:01.820 --> 50:03.060]  It's a trust circle.
[50:03.500 --> 50:04.760]  The power of friendship.
[50:08.900 --> 50:10.500]  Andrew, they're going to the right!
[50:10.940 --> 50:12.940]  Andrew! Hold your fire, Gavin.
[50:13.060 --> 50:14.140]  One sec, one sec, one sec.
[50:14.640 --> 50:15.080]  Andrew!
[50:15.500 --> 50:21.220]  And the second you moved...
[50:21.220 --> 50:22.460]  That's why I gotta hold him down.
[50:22.940 --> 50:23.980]  They know when he's there.
[50:23.980 --> 50:25.820]  They decide not to come when he's there.
[50:25.980 --> 50:27.320]  They're crawling.
[50:28.380 --> 50:29.340]  They're too smart.
[50:30.840 --> 50:32.040]  I think I got him.
[50:32.220 --> 50:32.740]  There's two more.
[50:35.660 --> 50:37.580]  I'm down to 99 bullets.
[50:38.540 --> 50:39.940]  There's a bunch of guns over here.
[50:40.100 --> 50:42.340]  There might be some guns over on this side.
[50:42.880 --> 50:43.680]  One more guy there.
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.180]  Wait for it.
[50:46.700 --> 50:47.100]  443.
[50:48.700 --> 50:49.840]  You already got all
[50:49.840 --> 50:50.840]  Eric's ammo, right?
[50:50.840 --> 50:53.180]  We're like a third of the way in.
[50:54.220 --> 50:56.480]  I can't believe the second Andrew left.
[50:56.640 --> 50:57.780]  That was unbelievable.
[50:58.980 --> 51:01.480]  I got jealous of all the friendship that was going on over there.
[51:03.820 --> 51:14.250]  I feel like I remember this being harder
[51:14.250 --> 51:15.650]  when we were trying to do it back in the day.
[51:15.810 --> 51:17.790]  Do you think we're just way better gamers now?
[51:18.190 --> 51:20.050]  No, I think we're going to be screwed when we run out of ammo.
[51:20.230 --> 51:23.030]  Andrew, I want you to know that I was watching
[51:23.030 --> 51:24.610]  your perspective as that happened.
[51:24.730 --> 51:26.070]  How did you not see that?
[51:27.510 --> 51:29.010]  I accidentally bumped
[51:29.010 --> 51:30.650]  something on the Twitch chat
[51:30.650 --> 51:32.290]  and I was trying to fix it.
[51:32.810 --> 51:33.530]  And I looked back.
[51:34.790 --> 51:35.450]  You're a mess.
[51:35.890 --> 51:37.890]  I'm going over here.
[51:38.430 --> 51:39.090]  Oh my god.
[51:40.570 --> 51:41.570]  Get far.
[51:44.250 --> 51:45.590]  Who's rolling up my nose again?
[51:45.750 --> 51:47.290]  Oh, it hit the line!
[51:48.550 --> 51:50.730]  That's not your fault.
[51:50.730 --> 51:51.870]  That was not your fault.
[51:51.910 --> 51:55.170]  I can't believe the line does anything.
[51:55.450 --> 51:56.350]  The power line?
[51:56.750 --> 51:58.050]  The line's got geometry.
[51:59.010 --> 51:59.810]  That's bollocks.
[52:00.210 --> 52:02.130]  Oh, I hit it again!
[52:02.510 --> 52:04.690]  Dude, that's so crazy. You did the exact same thing
[52:04.690 --> 52:05.790]  and the exact same thing happened?
[52:06.010 --> 52:08.650]  No, I changed the angle of the throw though.
[52:08.790 --> 52:10.430]  Oh my god, I changed it a third time.
[52:10.790 --> 52:12.750]  Guys, I don't know if you know
[52:12.750 --> 52:14.250]  what the definition of insanity is
[52:14.250 --> 52:15.030]  and I don't want to learn.
[52:16.070 --> 52:17.110]  Thanks for watching.
[52:17.110 --> 52:18.750]  Every Friday at 4pm central.
[52:19.110 --> 52:19.590]  Throwing a grenade.
[52:20.810 --> 52:23.250]  I threw the grenade in three different positions
[52:23.250 --> 52:25.110]  and it hit the same spot every time.
[52:26.670 --> 52:27.230]  Andrew!
[52:27.610 --> 52:28.110]  Lovely.
[52:28.870 --> 52:29.770]  That was great.
[52:43.020 --> 52:44.260]  Sixteen bullets left, Geoff.
[52:44.280 --> 52:44.940]  You ready to take over?
[52:47.180 --> 52:49.100]  Let me reload real fast.
[52:49.360 --> 52:50.500]  There's guns over by...
[52:50.500 --> 52:51.440]  So many guns by me.
[52:52.040 --> 52:53.160]  By Andrew, yeah.
[52:53.560 --> 52:56.300]  I'm going to roll over into your spot.
[52:56.300 --> 52:57.520]  Alright, I'm getting up.
[52:58.340 --> 52:59.700]  Now's the time. Do it, Gavin.
[52:59.940 --> 53:00.860]  I'm watching you, Gavin.
[53:03.740 --> 53:05.340]  You can hold the wall and get it.
[53:05.380 --> 53:06.580]  You'll get a weapon swap prompt.
[53:07.940 --> 53:09.200]  Got that prompt.
[53:10.040 --> 53:11.120]  Alright, Geoff is holding it down.
[53:11.300 --> 53:11.920]  Good work, Geoff.
[53:13.880 --> 53:14.980]  Gavin's on his way back.
[53:18.060 --> 53:19.080]  Conserve, buddy, conserve.
[53:20.360 --> 53:21.600]  I'm going to get him. Watch this.
[53:22.380 --> 53:22.880]  Watch this.
[53:22.880 --> 53:24.980]  I want to get on these grenades.
[53:25.080 --> 53:25.860]  How do you do that? Why?
[53:26.340 --> 53:28.500]  You hold B. It brings up, guess what?
[53:28.620 --> 53:29.220]  A weapon wheel.
[53:30.540 --> 53:31.940]  Wow, good throw.
[53:32.220 --> 53:34.160]  And then you select the grenade and you have to hold the button.
[53:36.700 --> 53:38.480]  I'm down to 34.
[53:38.780 --> 53:39.360]  I'm going to need to reload.
[53:41.700 --> 53:42.920]  Gavin's going to blow us up!
[53:43.340 --> 53:44.720]  Surely you realize you're an idiot.
[53:45.240 --> 53:46.340]  Oh, you charge it up.
[53:46.800 --> 53:47.160]  Yeah!
[53:48.060 --> 53:49.520]  Surely you realize you're an idiot.
[53:49.520 --> 53:51.620]  Alright, I'm going to get a 19.
[53:52.060 --> 53:52.460]  Disagree.
[53:52.880 --> 53:53.280]  13.
[53:56.180 --> 53:57.980]  Hope somebody's ready to take over.
[53:59.060 --> 54:00.000]  Is that how much ammo you have?
[54:00.220 --> 54:01.000]  Just period, Geoff?
[54:01.560 --> 54:03.080]  No, he just needs to reload.
[54:04.320 --> 54:04.900]  Taking over.
[54:05.340 --> 54:05.760]  Do it now.
[54:08.720 --> 54:08.900]  Okay.
[54:09.060 --> 54:10.480]  I'm back.
[54:12.160 --> 54:13.560]  I think two people need to be here.
[54:13.560 --> 54:14.000]  There's a guy in.
[54:14.340 --> 54:15.560]  Someone came in on the left.
[54:15.560 --> 54:16.720]  There's a guy in on the left.
[54:16.780 --> 54:17.860]  I can't get to him.
[54:20.140 --> 54:20.860]  Going down.
[54:24.720 --> 54:25.440]  36 minutes.
[54:25.740 --> 54:26.440]  36 minutes.
[54:26.780 --> 54:27.700]  I don't know if I got him.
[54:28.140 --> 54:28.540]  I got him.
[54:29.580 --> 54:32.020]  Should I just lie down and guard the zone?
[54:32.540 --> 54:32.820]  Sure.
[54:33.560 --> 54:36.500]  I think you should get back to your spot, but you're fine.
[54:37.120 --> 54:39.180]  I can take his spot and he can cover the right now.
[54:39.780 --> 54:40.580]  He has a shit gun.
[54:41.540 --> 54:41.720]  Yeah.
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.180]  How do you guard the right? You just lie down looking at the crack?
[54:45.800 --> 54:46.160]  Yeah.
[54:46.840 --> 54:48.020]  Just look at it.
[54:48.940 --> 54:50.240]  If anyone comes, shoot them.
[54:51.900 --> 54:53.320]  No one really comes this way, bud.
[54:56.380 --> 54:57.340]  It's nice to have a little...
[54:58.940 --> 54:59.300]  Akira101.
[54:59.680 --> 55:00.620]  Five gifted subs.
[55:01.260 --> 55:03.160]  Thank you very much. Really appreciate that.
[55:03.920 --> 55:05.340]  It's so hard to tell what I'm shooting.
[55:05.440 --> 55:06.020]  It's just diamonds.
[55:06.620 --> 55:07.540]  That's all you need to see.
[55:08.300 --> 55:10.700]  Well, sometimes a diamond is behind a truck. You don't know.
[55:10.860 --> 55:12.020]  No, you gotta wait until it's an outline.
[55:12.020 --> 55:13.900]  And they overlap on each other.
[55:14.620 --> 55:16.040]  If diamonds becomes outlines,
[55:16.520 --> 55:17.660]  that's when...
[55:17.660 --> 55:18.180]  Fire gun.
[55:19.140 --> 55:21.600]  Yeah, but sometimes they're just so mashed up on top of each other.
[55:21.700 --> 55:22.260]  It's just hard to tell.
[55:27.690 --> 55:28.330]  Doing good.
[55:28.650 --> 55:29.370]  35 minutes.
[55:30.410 --> 55:32.030]  Man, it's so nice to have a rest.
[55:32.310 --> 55:33.450]  That's some crazy concentration.
[55:33.850 --> 55:35.270]  Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot to give.
[55:39.330 --> 55:41.430]  Disposable Jim says hello, Gav.
[55:41.830 --> 55:42.730]  It is a lot to give,
[55:42.730 --> 55:44.410]  but it's what our nation requires of us,
[55:44.450 --> 55:44.930]  and it's our job.
[55:44.990 --> 55:47.070]  You know, some gave all, all gave some.
[55:48.970 --> 55:49.610]  Hello, Jim.
[55:50.150 --> 55:52.450]  I'm gonna need to reload in 5, 4,
[55:54.270 --> 55:54.990]  3, 2,
[55:56.030 --> 55:56.390]  1.
[55:56.410 --> 55:56.770]  I gotcha.
[55:57.390 --> 55:59.050]  He's reloading, and he's back.
[55:59.890 --> 56:01.350]  I see a little bit of action on the drone.
[56:02.570 --> 56:03.330]  Are you gonna drone it?
[56:04.030 --> 56:04.390]  Nah.
[56:06.970 --> 56:08.090]  What's the drone button, Andrew?
[56:08.150 --> 56:08.870]  You like hold something?
[56:08.870 --> 56:09.550]  Up on the D-pad.
[56:10.810 --> 56:11.430]  And then what?
[56:11.610 --> 56:14.910]  Hold right bumper. Well, if you wanna go into drone cam, hold right bumper.
[56:15.390 --> 56:17.330]  You wanna move it, push up on the D-pad.
[56:18.190 --> 56:18.970]  Are you happy with
[56:18.970 --> 56:19.650]  this position now?
[56:20.030 --> 56:20.710]  I like it.
[56:23.510 --> 56:24.750]  Up on the D-pad and what?
[56:24.850 --> 56:25.670]  I guess I just can't control it.
[56:25.670 --> 56:28.130]  You just click. Yeah, I don't think you can move it.
[56:28.350 --> 56:30.230]  No, I can't move it. Sad. Sad!
[56:33.210 --> 56:34.930]  Couple of guys getting through, but you're doing good.
[56:36.630 --> 56:37.210]  Health is
[56:37.210 --> 56:38.650]  pretty clean all around, too.
[56:39.250 --> 56:41.110]  Only damage I've taken was from Gavin's
[56:41.110 --> 56:41.430]  grenade.
[56:42.910 --> 56:44.390]  That hurt you? Yes.
[56:44.830 --> 56:45.990]  Sorry about that. That's okay.
[56:50.030 --> 56:50.750]  If someone
[56:50.750 --> 56:52.730]  said that you have to charge up the throw,
[56:52.850 --> 56:53.990]  I was ignoring that bit.
[56:54.970 --> 56:56.770]  Yeah, I thought that might be the case.
[56:57.990 --> 56:59.110]  I told him he had to hold it.
[56:59.550 --> 57:00.350]  Just chose not to.
[57:00.730 --> 57:01.970]  What's my favorite bean?
[57:02.630 --> 57:03.570]  Heinz Baked.
[57:04.030 --> 57:06.070]  I don't know what type of bean that actually is, but
[57:06.550 --> 57:07.410]  it's primo.
[57:08.350 --> 57:10.110]  Man, I'm blowing through the ammo doing this.
[57:10.190 --> 57:12.030]  I'm surprised you're not a Branston bean guy.
[57:12.770 --> 57:13.830]  Did Branston make beans?
[57:14.050 --> 57:14.290]  Yeah.
[57:15.510 --> 57:18.190]  What? Learn about your country sometime.
[57:18.230 --> 57:18.670]  Good lord.
[57:21.350 --> 57:22.310]  Branston beans?
[57:22.650 --> 57:22.870]  Yeah.
[57:23.610 --> 57:25.750]  Dude, Akira again with five more gifted subs.
[57:26.030 --> 57:26.670]  Thanks, Akira.
[57:27.290 --> 57:28.770]  I think I got some action.
[57:28.770 --> 57:30.010]  Oh, you got someone coming in.
[57:30.010 --> 57:30.970]  I'm about to reload.
[57:32.470 --> 57:34.250]  I've got some guy on the drone.
[57:34.630 --> 57:35.890]  He's getting cheeky.
[57:36.150 --> 57:36.650]  Gavin?
[57:39.630 --> 57:40.690]  Here he comes.
[57:41.030 --> 57:41.570]  Blow him away.
[57:43.050 --> 57:44.250]  Geoff, I'm going to reload.
[57:50.440 --> 57:51.900]  Wasted two bullets on that guy.
[57:51.960 --> 57:52.280]  Damn it.
[57:55.980 --> 57:57.460]  Geoff is down to like...
[57:57.860 --> 57:59.060]  He has like 80 bullets.
[58:00.740 --> 58:01.100]  Yeah.
[58:01.720 --> 58:03.080]  You could reload real quick
[58:03.080 --> 58:04.020]  and just put him in there.
[58:04.840 --> 58:06.040]  Guy on the ground called George F.
[58:06.040 --> 58:07.700]  12 year old achievement hunter reference.
[58:09.360 --> 58:10.200]  What was the reference?
[58:10.580 --> 58:11.200]  Liquid beans.
[58:13.640 --> 58:14.000]  Gavin?
[58:15.020 --> 58:16.180]  Gavin, you can try to get that gun.
[58:16.400 --> 58:17.480]  I'm going to reload real fast.
[58:17.720 --> 58:18.200]  Which gun?
[58:19.200 --> 58:20.160]  The one right in front of you?
[58:20.660 --> 58:23.460]  Yeah, but this is a full gun. I can't add the ammo to it.
[58:24.720 --> 58:25.880]  Oh, I didn't know how this game works.
[58:25.880 --> 58:28.420]  I'm pretty sure I'll just swap my gun for that one.
[58:28.500 --> 58:29.040]  I see.
[58:35.040 --> 58:36.280]  What's liquid beans reference?
[58:36.420 --> 58:37.920]  It was a family feud.
[58:40.140 --> 58:41.780]  I think I was trying to type limer.
[58:41.980 --> 58:42.660]  Hit the wrong button.
[58:44.620 --> 58:45.700]  Came out liquids.
[58:49.760 --> 58:50.500]  Way to go, Geoff.
[58:50.660 --> 58:51.140]  Sneaky guy.
[58:56.860 --> 58:58.460]  Geoff is down to his last
[58:58.460 --> 58:59.380]  45 bullets.
[59:00.420 --> 59:01.500]  Not for reload.
[59:01.740 --> 59:03.000]  Like last 45 bullets period.
[59:03.320 --> 59:04.980]  I would recommend
[59:06.100 --> 59:07.160]  when that happens,
[59:07.700 --> 59:09.400]  Gavin, you should swap with Andrew.
[59:09.500 --> 59:10.900]  Andrew, you should move over to the Geoff spot.
[59:11.020 --> 59:12.880]  And Geoff, you should go over to where Gavin was.
[59:13.000 --> 59:13.820]  There's a gun.
[59:14.900 --> 59:17.220]  Tell me when I need to get up and resume my spot.
[59:17.540 --> 59:19.580]  I got 28 bullets left.
[59:20.120 --> 59:20.740]  Okay, I'm getting up.
[59:24.730 --> 59:25.510]  So are they.
[59:26.550 --> 59:27.070]  Yeah, it looks like
[59:27.070 --> 59:28.090]  there's a lot of movement up.
[59:36.320 --> 59:36.840]  Ooh.
[59:39.200 --> 59:40.720]  It's not even the AI.
[59:40.940 --> 59:42.840]  It's like the frame rate of the movement
[59:42.840 --> 59:43.640]  of these guys.
[59:43.940 --> 59:45.780]  They just snap into places.
[59:45.940 --> 59:48.000]  There's no predictable fluidity.
[59:49.560 --> 59:50.080]  13.
[59:50.920 --> 59:51.960]  Last 10 bullets.
[59:53.100 --> 59:53.880]  I'm coming over.
[59:54.560 --> 59:55.240]  Yeah, you need to.
[59:56.400 --> 59:57.540]  Yeah, Geoff, you need to get out of there.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.480]  Yeah!
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.340]  Yeah!
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.400]  Yeah!
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.220]  That was awesome!
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.980]  Where are these guns?
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.060]  It's all the way down at the end there.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.780]  That might be his saw, actually.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360]  Ooh, I don't know.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.480]  That might be Gavin's old gun.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.800]  I don't think I can pick it up.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.740]  You can't hold Y on it?
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.120]  You can use your secondary, and if they come up, just blast them.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:26.700]  No, I got it.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.080]  Okay, you have 7 bullets.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.520]  Reloading.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.820]  Geoff, don't peek out that far.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.520]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.020]  I'm okay.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.280]  You have no bullets. You need to switch to your other gun.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.940]  Andrew, are you with me?
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:42.340]  Yep.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.040]  Andrew's on your right.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.600]  So I just hold the right down, I guess, right?
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.000]  Yeah.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.080]  We're at officially 30 minutes.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.580]  Happy 501.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.160]  501!
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.680]  It's quitting time, but that means that this is our last try.
[01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:00.800]  This is the last effort.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.860]  If we get it, cool.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.240]  If we don't, tough.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.720]  This is quitting time, baby.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.800]  Let's bring it home.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:08.400]  No slacking. Reloading!
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.460]  What's everybody got?
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.220]  I got 80 rounds.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.280]  I got 67.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:18.260]  Okay, so the 80 rounds
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.400]  that Geoff has are
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.440]  pistol ammo.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.840]  Geoff, you didn't pick up one of the guns?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.780]  I did.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.500]  It was your old saw.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160]  Which had 7 bullets in it.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.180]  The other guns are gone.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.640]  I left it at 007.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.220]  Yeah, pretty cool, man.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.940]  Yeah, it was really cool of you to do that.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:40.640]  I got reload.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:43.760]  Reloading.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.240]  You might have to
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.560]  start thinking about
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.860]  how you're going to get...
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.440]  If you need to coax some guys in to kill them
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.760]  to see if you can get ammo.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.440]  I'm going to bait.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.380]  I know what we can do.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:56.700]  Okay.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.340]  He needs to try to get people in
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.840]  so that way the gun can come through.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.960]  We also have smoke grenades, don't forget.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.920]  Should we go for another grenade throw
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.660]  and I'll just run out there?
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.560]  I'm out of grenades, I think.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.360]  About four hit the power line, so it didn't really work out.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.780]  Yeah, three of mine hit the power line.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.200]  I'm going to throw a grenade over.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:16.760]  Okay.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.240]  Yeah, no, you got it.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:19.900]  Absolutely.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.820]  We got a few dead guys in the front.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.620]  Wow, right through the power lines. Way to go, dude.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.700]  Oh, there's a gun right there. You see that?
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:28.500]  You see that, Gavin?
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.800]  Yeah, but there's still quite a lot of people.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]  A lot, a lot, a lot.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.260]  You can smoke grenade and see if you can go over and get it.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.380]  I got it.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.420]  You go ready to go. I'm going to smoke grenade.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.780]  Okay. Are you ready?
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.200]  The fact I haven't
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.540]  shot either of you, I deserve a fucking medal.
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.000]  Andrew, you've been doing great.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.200]  Where's the smoke?
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.420]  It's in the sky.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.820]  It blew up in the sky.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.580]  You mad cloud.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.880]  Oh my god!
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:01.780]  There's a gun!
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.700]  Yeah, throw the smoke, Geoff. I've got a gun now.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.300]  Throw the smoke. Put it on the floor.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.900]  Not on me.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.140]  It's not on you.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]  Pick it up, the gun.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.720]  Pick it up, the gun.
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.380]  Pick up the gun, you stupid bollocks.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:17.880]  Who's that?
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:18.540]  Geoffgun.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.720]  I can't get it.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.260]  Somebody help Gavin.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.700]  I'm getting him up.
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.360]  He's up.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.660]  You have the wrong gun equipped.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.060]  Alright, we need another smoke.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.640]  Jesus Christ.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.980]  Everyone's just walking.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.640]  He's just walking in front.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.680]  I'm going to throw another smoke.
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.980]  He's already thrown it.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.980]  You need to switch to your other gun.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.080]  What is happening?
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.640]  There you go. Weapon swap.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.740]  Get a gun.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.200]  Geoff doesn't know where he's going.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.140]  He can't see.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.300]  I didn't get one.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.940]  How did you not get one?
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.720]  He threw the smoke and then
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.440]  ran directly in the smoke.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.640]  Where's my NVGs?
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.840]  Where's my NVGs?
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.980]  How do I turn on my NVGs?
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:15.420]  I didn't think that was going to help you with the smoke.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.020]  Night vision?
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.040]  This is so good.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:22.620]  So funny.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.640]  I'm going to have to throw
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.340]  more smoke.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.040]  We can both go again.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.860]  I'm going to need ammo again in a sec.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.880]  Andrew, you were
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.040]  doing such a good job too.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.560]  It was impossible.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.680]  They just kept running
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.940]  left and right across.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.540]  Geoff trying to be on the offensive
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.680]  here with his pistol in front of
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.260]  everyone is so funny.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.400]  Who shot me?
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.020]  Just put him down.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.920]  Who shot me?
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.220]  I'm going to come and get you.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.880]  I definitely got shot from behind.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.380]  Yep.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.160]  I just don't know why you were there to begin with.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.720]  I got to get close to get a
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.380]  fucking gun.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.840]  You were using your pistol.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.320]  That's all I got.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.820]  I don't know why you're trying to.
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.120]  I got 80 more bullets.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.380]  What do we do after this?
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.560]  Should we get ready to go and get more
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.060]  guns, Geoff?
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360]  They all stood up at the same time.
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:33.880]  Did you see that?
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.500]  No.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.900]  Are they listening to our
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.340]  comms?
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.300]  They're stream sniping.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.160]  I'm going to throw a grenade.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.720]  I'm going to throw a smoke.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.520]  Do it.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.060]  There's smoke.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]  And go.
[01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:55.450]  Better make something happen, Gavin.
[01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.410]  I fucking did it.
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:05:59.270]  There you go.
[01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:00.330]  Gavin's down.
[01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.570]  There was so much ammo in that.
[01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:03.770]  I had 300 bullets.
[01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:05.250]  Geoff is dead.
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.050]  Andrew, you got this. 24 minutes.
[01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:10.310]  I died running to Gavin.
[01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.270]  The smoke.
[01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.450]  The smoke didn't cover.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.400]  Andrew,
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:21.200]  you're nailing it.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.620]  Imagine if you had a bunch of people on your team.
[01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.250]  Six bullets.
[01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:35.610]  He only
[01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:36.750]  has six bullets left.
[01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:39.030]  You can smoke grenade and see what happens.
[01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:39.510]  It's funny.
[01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:43.110]  3-2-1-0. He's out.
[01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:45.590]  I died with a
[01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:46.170]  gun with ammo.
[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:48.510]  Cool, man. Way to go.
[01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.570]  If you can smoke grenade it down there, you can pick it up.
[01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:53.390]  If you get a grenade over Andrew, there's a gun
[01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:54.370]  with 300 bullets.
[01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.530]  I'm locking this down with my pistol for a bit.
[01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:58.830]  You can start
[01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:01.650]  crawling closer to them.
[01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:02.250]  It might
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.930]  give you
[01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:05.570]  a little bit of time.
[01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:12.050]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:13.550]  So close.
[01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:15.770]  We'll be back.
[01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.670]  456,
[01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.850]  176, 158, and 37.
[01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.150]  That's a lot of dead men.
[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.130]  If we had Nick, I think we could have got down
[01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:24.890]  to 10 minutes.
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.390]  We got pretty far. How far? 36 minutes?
[01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:28.690]  Yep.
[01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:30.910]  23 and a half minutes to go?
[01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:32.470]  Yep. Damn.
[01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:34.650]  I'm going to watch the replay
[01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.430]  of this on Tuesday because I want to know how I died.
[01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.750]  I want to know what got me. I just died out of
[01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.350]  nowhere. It was like, oh, I didn't
[01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:41.670]  think anything
[01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:44.330]  got me. And I just was dead.
[01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:45.730]  You were just gone.
[01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:47.170]  All of a sudden,
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:50.630]  done. I felt like we were really locking
[01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:52.390]  it down too. I felt good about it. Terrible.
[01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:54.770]  Sad. I think I'm averaging
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.450]  at two bullets per person.
[01:07:57.290 --> 01:07:58.030]  That's not bad.
[01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.790]  That's pretty good.
[01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:01.450]  I think that
[01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:04.110]  that system works.
[01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:06.490]  We just keep cycling the big gun through.
[01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:07.930]  We'll have Nick.
[01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.250]  We'll have Nick next time.
[01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.030]  And also, maybe now that we know that the power lines are real
[01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.810]  bastards, we won't lose as many grenades.
[01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.110]  My God, that sucked.
[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.010]  Man. Well,
[01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:19.530]  Andrew wants to be my friend.
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:21.890]  It's pretty exciting for me, guys.
[01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.130]  Thanks so much for watching.
[01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.270]  This has been our regular
[01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:27.150]  Friday stream. We do it every
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:29.090]  Friday at 4 p.m. Central. If you're watching
[01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.730]  this on YouTube
[01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:33.170]  on Tuesday, or I guess any other day
[01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:34.930]  after that, we stream
[01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:37.150]  every Friday at
[01:08:37.150 --> 01:08:39.050]  4 p.m. on twitch.tv
[01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:40.930]  slash the regulation pod. So be here.
[01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:43.210]  It's a lot of fun. The chat's going off.
[01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:45.170]  We're playing fun games. I'm having a good
[01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:47.070]  time. And I want to thank you guys for joining.
[01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:48.930]  We're also doing streams every Thursday
[01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:50.690]  of October. Nick's playing Last of Us.
[01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:52.590]  Nick is playing Last of Us. It's true.
[01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.570]  Be sure to turn in for that. He's losing his
[01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:56.690]  god damn mind a little bit every week. It's fun to watch.
[01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.130]  Andrew messaged me earlier today
[01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:00.510]  and he just said, hey, so
[01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:02.670]  after watching me play Ratatouille and Nick
[01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:04.690]  play Last of Us 2, which is
[01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:06.670]  like the most, like the more
[01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:08.210]  unhinged one. And I said,
[01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:10.590]  I've seen you play Ratatouille more
[01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:12.790]  so I feel kind of like I know where your head's
[01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:14.570]  at. Nick is like,
[01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:16.870]  he has flashes of brilliance followed by
[01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:18.670]  sheer panic and then
[01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.570]  can't like replicate what
[01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.610]  he did to be successful the first time.
[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.070]  Going
[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.570]  45 minutes and then going, I can just save
[01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:28.590]  right now was the craziest thing I think I've
[01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:30.550]  ever seen. That was unreal.
[01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:32.510]  Unreal. Never seen anything
[01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:33.090]  like it.
[01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.270]  Well, have a great weekend. Geoff.Sucks.
[01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:39.730]  Geoff.Sucks.
