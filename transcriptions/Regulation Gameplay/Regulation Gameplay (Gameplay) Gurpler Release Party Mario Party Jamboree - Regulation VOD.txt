[00:00.000 --> 00:06.040]  Yeah, what what is that you see what I see there the mall. This is our old game
[00:06.040 --> 00:12.480]  I think are you serious? We continue our old game? Can we continue it? I don't know. Let's see what happens. What?
[00:13.900 --> 00:17.540]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god
[00:19.500 --> 00:21.280]  Who hasn't set up their controller? We have to!
[00:21.840 --> 00:27.120]  Who's the mole Geoff? Geoff? Yeah. Yeah, let me I'm sorry. I had my controllers on the thing, but I got to do the other thing
[00:31.660 --> 00:32.060]  I
[00:32.620 --> 00:39.180]  Had my controllers on the thing, but I have to do the other thing. Geoff, I'm taking care of the merch you play the video game
[00:40.160 --> 00:41.080]  There we go
[00:42.540 --> 00:43.800]  No, I did it already
[00:50.700 --> 00:53.080]  Begin with these settings again. Oh, yeah
[00:53.860 --> 00:59.040]  I don't know what the fuck is whoops. Oh, what what I just pressed a but
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.280]  What did you do? Oh, yeah, I was able to connect my controller again. Oh
[01:07.980 --> 01:10.460]  Okay, oh my god
[01:12.500 --> 01:13.880]  Another one after this
[01:13.880 --> 01:16.000]  Yeah, we'll have to finish this one. Yep
[01:17.760 --> 01:19.840]  This Dilkong's back. Insane.
[01:20.440 --> 01:22.220]  Return of Dilkong!
[01:22.760 --> 01:29.140]  Truly is. This is anyone's game. Should we try to remember what we're doing? I don't remember. I'm winning? Sweet!
[01:30.300 --> 01:37.560]  Didn't I just kick this? Oh, I just got Luigi. That's right. Okay. Okay. Oh
[01:37.560 --> 01:43.620]  My god, we don't care. We had that stupid showdown. Here we go. Oh
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.740]  Oh, I can't.
[01:46.360 --> 01:46.740]  What?
[01:47.820 --> 01:50.320]  A mushroom? Who hits it? It's Geoff.
[01:51.260 --> 01:55.900]  Fuck! See? It is Geoff. I know what's up. Give me that mushroom.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.480]  Okay, so if you're just joining us, the gameplays are gone and we're continuing the game that Andrew dropped out of
[02:07.040 --> 02:08.000]  several weeks ago.
[02:08.880 --> 02:13.220]  Unbelievable. The return of Dilkong and all of his glory? Here we go.
[02:14.340 --> 02:19.340]  Back in the mall? This is good shit. This is crazy. I can't believe we're back. Fuck!
[02:21.100 --> 02:23.720]  Yeah, Dilkong's back. NOOOOOO!
[02:24.440 --> 02:24.960]  NOOOOOO!
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.080]  Fucking bullshit!
[02:30.720 --> 02:31.240]  What?!
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.100]  I think when Dilkong became AI...
[02:33.100 --> 02:34.460]  Delete this save!
[02:34.780 --> 02:36.280]  We're doing a new game!
[02:38.520 --> 02:42.620]  When you left last time and Dilkong became AI, he didn't land on that.
[02:42.620 --> 02:50.340]  Wait, no. Wait, he gave you money! What just happened? I don't know! He felt bad for him, so he gave him money!
[02:50.600 --> 02:50.940]  YEAH!
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.020]  Do it!
[02:54.640 --> 02:56.200]  What the fuck? Hell yeah!
[02:57.220 --> 03:00.900]  1, 2, 3, 4...
[03:00.900 --> 03:02.580]  Stamps aren't even stamped, okay?
[03:03.400 --> 03:03.960]  I don't give a fuck.
[03:04.120 --> 03:06.300]  5, 6, 7...
[03:08.980 --> 03:10.040]  That's what he sounds like.
[03:10.420 --> 03:11.860]  This is the gold shop.
[03:11.860 --> 03:13.040]  It's full of gold and items.
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.100]  My favorite.
[03:14.320 --> 03:16.600]  Do you wanna buy shiny gold items? I guess so.
[03:17.680 --> 03:18.100]  Wait, where?
[03:19.000 --> 03:19.900]  I guess so.
[03:21.240 --> 03:22.820]  Geoff doesn't know what's happening.
[03:23.940 --> 03:26.060]  Welcome, you have the shiny gold items you could ever want.
[03:26.180 --> 03:26.440]  Okay.
[03:28.120 --> 03:29.160]  Uh, how much money do I have?
[03:29.240 --> 03:29.960]  Oh, I got some money.
[03:31.040 --> 03:32.280]  Move to the space before the star.
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.000]  Dude, these are good.
[03:34.260 --> 03:35.580]  Geoff, how many coins do you have?
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.760]  I only have 36, so I'm just gonna do this one.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.720]  Shouldn't you buy the warp pipe?
[03:39.820 --> 03:41.720]  So you can go right to the star and then buy the star?
[03:42.020 --> 03:43.480]  But then I won't have enough to buy the star.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.200]  Yeah, you... okay.
[03:45.840 --> 03:48.600]  Because the star... the warp pipe is 25 and I only have 36 coins.
[03:49.100 --> 03:50.040]  You don't have to buy the...
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.540]  You don't have to use the pipe now.
[03:52.140 --> 03:54.060]  I could use a later.
[03:55.340 --> 03:55.980]  You could.
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.160]  I could use a later.
[03:58.580 --> 03:59.400]  But it's too late now.
[03:59.400 --> 04:00.340]  I already bought it, right?
[04:02.260 --> 04:03.180]  No, it's too late.
[04:03.400 --> 04:04.420]  Yeah, he's locked in.
[04:04.420 --> 04:05.500]  He already...
[04:05.500 --> 04:07.600]  Nick, he already blew it. It's fine.
[04:07.720 --> 04:08.160]  Yeah, I know.
[04:09.700 --> 04:11.980]  Don't worry, I got big brain ideas here.
[04:13.120 --> 04:14.240]  Big brain ideas?
[04:14.900 --> 04:15.120]  Yeah.
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.380]  You just worry about your mushroom.
[04:21.420 --> 04:21.880]  Shroom!
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.040]  Alright, let's roll this bastard.
[04:26.200 --> 04:27.140]  10! Shit.
[04:27.140 --> 04:27.840]  Ah!
[04:30.860 --> 04:32.060]  Oh, 7 seems fine.
[04:32.120 --> 04:33.420]  Oh, stamp my shit.
[04:33.600 --> 04:34.620]  Oh no!
[04:35.860 --> 04:38.260]  That's 50 coins when I get downstairs, I think.
[04:38.620 --> 04:39.460]  Wait, it's...
[04:39.460 --> 04:41.040]  Oh my god!
[04:41.240 --> 04:42.360]  50 coins?
[04:42.960 --> 04:43.660]  Wow!
[04:43.940 --> 04:48.040]  Are you kidding me?
[04:49.780 --> 04:51.260]  This game sucks!
[04:52.020 --> 04:52.380]  12!
[04:53.100 --> 04:54.280]  Fuck off!
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.020]  Where'd he go, Gavin?
[04:56.320 --> 05:00.240]  People who got GURPS and were in the regulations store, what was it like being in there?
[05:00.300 --> 05:03.520]  Were you panicked? Were you just freaking out trying to press everything as quickly as possible?
[05:03.680 --> 05:04.680]  I was panicked.
[05:04.900 --> 05:06.580]  I was pretty panicked.
[05:06.700 --> 05:09.280]  I'm always nervous when I'm buying something that's about to go real quick.
[05:09.700 --> 05:10.720]  I can't...
[05:10.720 --> 05:12.960]  I'm so fucking happy the store didn't crash.
[05:13.600 --> 05:13.800]  Yep.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.640]  There was a lot of panic, apparently.
[05:15.760 --> 05:18.960]  We have baby-stepped into things working.
[05:19.880 --> 05:21.040]  So, this is good.
[05:21.640 --> 05:23.300]  I'm not supposed to be recording this video, right?
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.680]  Somebody else doing that?
[05:25.160 --> 05:25.880]  It was never discussed.
[05:27.080 --> 05:28.420]  Wow, thanks, Luigi.
[05:29.220 --> 05:30.960]  Oh, you get to buy two stars!
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.000]  Oh!
[05:32.940 --> 05:34.400]  Are you serious?
[05:35.320 --> 05:36.400]  Nice, dude.
[05:37.080 --> 05:37.800]  Check it out, Andrew!
[05:38.420 --> 05:39.720]  Andrew, how many stars do you have?
[05:40.820 --> 05:44.060]  Out of the four of us, I feel the best about you getting that.
[05:44.360 --> 05:45.000]  Me too!
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.180]  Thanks, man!
[05:47.400 --> 05:48.880]  Wow, thanks, guys!
[05:49.900 --> 05:51.220]  Well, don't say thanks, guys.
[05:51.220 --> 05:52.280]  Well, I guess me and Eric.
[05:52.460 --> 05:53.720]  Definitely Gavin and Andrew.
[05:53.940 --> 05:55.140]  Give it to me.
[05:55.240 --> 05:57.460]  Oh, I think that's close!
[05:58.140 --> 05:59.060]  I think that's close!
[06:02.540 --> 06:02.800]  Yeah!
[06:03.040 --> 06:03.680]  I think I'm close!
[06:06.260 --> 06:07.060]  Snortin' coins.
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.000]  Thanks, Luigi!
[06:10.280 --> 06:12.240]  I cannot believe this is still...
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.000]  No!
[06:13.860 --> 06:15.320]  Oh, my God.
[06:17.400 --> 06:18.920]  Wow, if that was a star, that would've been nuts.
[06:18.920 --> 06:20.500]  That would've been awesome.
[06:22.020 --> 06:22.500]  Wow!
[06:23.300 --> 06:24.660]  Bonus minigame? Okay. Lock in.
[06:25.100 --> 06:26.180]  Dilkong, lockin' in.
[06:28.080 --> 06:29.040]  Don't worry, Andrew.
[06:29.320 --> 06:30.700]  You're on a team with me.
[06:31.000 --> 06:31.680]  Oh, fuck!
[06:32.900 --> 06:34.840]  Me and Nick! Hell yeah, Nick!
[06:35.080 --> 06:35.520]  Hell yeah, dude!
[06:35.720 --> 06:37.180]  Geoff, we got this!
[06:38.700 --> 06:38.900]  Vertical!
[06:39.780 --> 06:43.300]  Let's push Geoff's shit in and then push Andrew's shit into Geoff's too.
[06:43.320 --> 06:43.620]  You got it!
[06:44.860 --> 06:45.900]  Oh, my God!
[06:45.900 --> 06:46.380]  Hold!
[06:46.900 --> 06:48.240]  Oh, my God!
[06:50.740 --> 06:51.600]  Alright, I got it.
[06:51.920 --> 06:52.800]  You figuring it out?
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.100]  Okay, good. Good deal.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.120]  Alright, I'm good.
[06:57.320 --> 06:58.480]  Do you understand what you're doing, guys?
[06:58.900 --> 06:59.560]  Geoff, you got the button?
[07:01.000 --> 07:01.660]  Hold the trigger.
[07:03.600 --> 07:05.440]  You hold the trigger, then you shake that shit.
[07:05.440 --> 07:08.240]  Oh, I see. Geoff, it's the right trigger and the right bumper.
[07:08.880 --> 07:09.420]  Think of it that way.
[07:10.260 --> 07:11.420]  I think it's all.
[07:12.760 --> 07:13.500]  Did you figure it out?
[07:14.260 --> 07:16.320]  There's Dilkong. Monty Mole isn't doing anything.
[07:16.500 --> 07:17.360]  He's trying to figure it out.
[07:17.700 --> 07:19.200]  Oh, it's the left one.
[07:20.100 --> 07:20.640]  Alright, I got it.
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.700]  For whatever reason, mine is the left one.
[07:24.140 --> 07:25.400]  Okay, here we go, guys.
[07:25.760 --> 07:26.520]  Alright, Nick, let's go.
[07:27.180 --> 07:29.560]  Wow, dude, I'm going ham.
[07:29.820 --> 07:31.220]  Nick, show them what you're best at.
[07:31.980 --> 07:32.800]  Hey, what the fuck, man?
[07:34.940 --> 07:35.600]  Let's do this.
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.240]  Anytime, guys. Anytime.
[07:37.820 --> 07:38.760]  You gotta hit that start.
[07:38.780 --> 07:40.500]  I forgot, Geoff. We gotta get ready.
[07:41.200 --> 07:42.640]  Oh, this is gonna be good. Here we go.
[07:42.880 --> 07:43.880]  Look at this.
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.480]  This is what I've been waiting for.
[07:46.820 --> 07:48.000]  I hope my wife doesn't walk in.
[07:49.040 --> 07:50.640]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[07:51.180 --> 07:52.520]  Alright, crank off, go.
[07:52.680 --> 07:53.440]  Crank off, crank off.
[07:54.780 --> 07:56.160]  Jerk, jerk, jerk.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.560]  Jerk, jerk, jerk.
[08:00.620 --> 08:01.020]  Yeah!
[08:03.340 --> 08:03.740]  Woo!
[08:05.460 --> 08:07.120]  I really hurt my arm.
[08:07.880 --> 08:08.280]  Woo!
[08:08.280 --> 08:09.360]  Fuck me in the ass.
[08:09.440 --> 08:12.740]  Dillkong the Hot Cranker.
[08:13.900 --> 08:16.140]  Get those Dillkongs in the chat.
[08:19.100 --> 08:21.240]  He's the leader of the pack.
[08:22.280 --> 08:24.140]  You know him well.
[08:28.980 --> 08:32.100]  I think I got tennis elbow or something from that.
[08:32.520 --> 08:34.200]  Oh, yeah, dude. That's pretty brutal.
[08:34.200 --> 08:34.340]  Oh.
[08:35.800 --> 08:39.180]  Okay, watch Dillkong pull this up with some sweet dice action.
[08:39.740 --> 08:40.180]  Hell yeah.
[08:41.040 --> 08:41.540]  Yeah!
[08:44.280 --> 08:45.440]  Fuck video games.
[08:46.060 --> 08:48.060]  How did you not use your additional bug?
[08:48.060 --> 08:48.320]  Oh!
[08:49.120 --> 08:51.740]  Do you guys hear that?
[08:51.900 --> 08:53.200]  I'll nab you a star?
[08:54.260 --> 08:56.280]  Dude, he's just gonna give you one?
[08:56.820 --> 08:58.380]  Well, he's gonna give you one.
[08:58.420 --> 08:59.300]  Did you guys hear that?
[09:00.220 --> 09:02.460]  Now, who are you gonna pick?
[09:03.060 --> 09:03.620]  Random.
[09:04.920 --> 09:05.780]  I heard a bird.
[09:06.680 --> 09:07.240]  One.
[09:08.080 --> 09:10.040]  They kept saying one over and over again.
[09:10.520 --> 09:12.540]  They kept saying one over and over again.
[09:13.180 --> 09:13.920]  They wanted one.
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.660]  I'm gonna take one. Let's take one.
[09:15.980 --> 09:17.560]  I'll take one. I like one.
[09:18.260 --> 09:19.380]  Let's grab one.
[09:20.260 --> 09:21.320]  Give me one.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.900]  You wanted one? I'll give you one.
[09:24.260 --> 09:25.040]  Give me one.
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.080]  I think Andrew might be unhinged.
[09:28.820 --> 09:29.860]  I'll take the one.
[09:29.860 --> 09:31.940]  I think he might be gone.
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.420]  Give me the one.
[09:33.920 --> 09:35.800]  I think Andrew might be gone, man.
[09:35.860 --> 09:37.080]  This is the first game.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.820]  This is the return of the Dilkong.
[09:39.120 --> 09:40.260]  God damn it!
[09:47.510 --> 09:48.470]  Piece of shit!
[09:52.760 --> 09:54.940]  You better hope that Nick doesn't go around
[09:54.940 --> 09:56.420]  past Boo with his Luigi.
[09:56.720 --> 09:59.700]  I'll buy two more.
[10:01.360 --> 10:02.860]  Shove one up, yeah!
[10:03.300 --> 10:04.540]  I ain't worried about it.
[10:05.180 --> 10:06.440]  He can steal my Nick.
[10:06.520 --> 10:07.540]  He gave me negative one.
[10:07.600 --> 10:08.460]  I got one star.
[10:08.620 --> 10:09.540]  My first star.
[10:12.760 --> 10:14.860]  Oh, my mole is speeding.
[10:15.140 --> 10:15.920]  Look at him go!
[10:16.120 --> 10:17.560]  Look at that quick little mole.
[10:19.440 --> 10:19.920]  Well...
[10:19.920 --> 10:20.800]  Mole power's activated.
[10:21.820 --> 10:22.600]  He was quick.
[10:24.560 --> 10:25.600]  Hello, boys.
[10:25.720 --> 10:26.320]  Right behind him.
[10:28.760 --> 10:30.080]  Geoff, I can't believe we won.
[10:30.220 --> 10:30.980]  That was crazy.
[10:31.520 --> 10:32.820]  I believed in us, man.
[10:32.880 --> 10:34.460]  I didn't.
[10:34.660 --> 10:37.120]  These guys sell Jack off like we Jack off.
[10:39.860 --> 10:41.760]  Crank it, try hard style.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.300]  My arm is all kinds of fucked up.
[10:49.760 --> 10:51.140]  I want it to feel like
[10:51.140 --> 10:52.340]  I'm starting a campfire.
[10:53.460 --> 10:55.200]  What the fuck is this?
[10:55.200 --> 10:56.820]  Oh, no!
[10:57.300 --> 10:59.520]  I can only get coins, don't worry.
[11:03.960 --> 11:06.140]  At least hold on to it, I guess.
[11:09.520 --> 11:10.040]  Lovely.
[11:12.040 --> 11:13.220]  I'll start saving up.
[11:13.680 --> 11:14.420]  Oh, boo bell time.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.580]  There's too many turns left.
[11:24.040 --> 11:24.800]  Oh, man.
[11:28.890 --> 11:30.810]  Half coin steal trap, swap mirror.
[11:31.550 --> 11:33.010]  If you missed the start of the stream,
[11:33.090 --> 11:34.930]  we were able to continue our game that
[11:34.930 --> 11:37.010]  we didn't finish last time.
[11:37.150 --> 11:37.550]  No!
[11:38.270 --> 11:40.290]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[11:44.170 --> 11:45.550]  Six to the star!
[11:45.690 --> 11:47.350]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[11:49.450 --> 11:51.110]  Hey, that's not enough.
[11:51.450 --> 11:53.230]  Let little brother help you out.
[11:53.370 --> 11:54.230]  Here's an easy ten.
[11:57.530 --> 12:00.430]  This cog just got fucking dilled, bro.
[12:01.070 --> 12:02.990]  I didn't even get to stamp!
[12:06.090 --> 12:07.690]  This cog got dilled.
[12:09.090 --> 12:10.190]  Oh, my God.
[12:10.570 --> 12:11.350]  You gotta keep it going.
[12:11.790 --> 12:12.710]  I'd rather not.
[12:13.150 --> 12:15.770]  Hey, what's over here, Nick?
[12:15.850 --> 12:16.870]  What's this, guys?
[12:17.350 --> 12:18.690]  Is that one star?
[12:19.150 --> 12:20.010]  Is that two?
[12:21.730 --> 12:22.890]  Two stars?
[12:22.890 --> 12:25.350]  Is that two stars?
[12:26.550 --> 12:27.030]  What a move.
[12:29.540 --> 12:29.950]  Andrew!
[12:30.190 --> 12:34.010]  Andrew might have messed up his mic or something.
[12:37.030 --> 12:38.570]  He's banana drew.
[12:40.970 --> 12:42.710]  He's trying to charge up
[12:42.710 --> 12:44.870]  Dilkong power, so he's
[12:44.870 --> 12:45.990]  eating bananas.
[12:47.630 --> 12:48.450]  Andrew
[12:48.450 --> 12:50.350]  disconnecting his router again.
[12:51.870 --> 12:52.630]  Oh, no!
[12:53.010 --> 12:54.750]  My switch died again.
[12:56.150 --> 12:57.030]  Is that close?
[12:57.210 --> 12:57.630]  Oh, my God.
[12:58.610 --> 13:00.190]  Oh, good for you, fucker.
[13:01.930 --> 13:02.730]  Oh, look!
[13:03.070 --> 13:04.190]  Oh, wow! What's this?
[13:04.190 --> 13:05.630]  Look at this!
[13:06.530 --> 13:07.450]  Golden pipe?
[13:08.450 --> 13:10.850]  Now, you only have 34 coins, but they
[13:10.850 --> 13:12.230]  come so fast, Nick.
[13:12.310 --> 13:14.190]  Sometimes they come hot and heavy.
[13:14.670 --> 13:16.050]  I think that's maybe a pretty good buy.
[13:16.170 --> 13:16.890]  Nick's a problem.
[13:16.890 --> 13:18.570]  I'm coming for it, too.
[13:18.690 --> 13:20.610]  Might be a good purchase there, buddy.
[13:21.110 --> 13:21.530]  Yeah!
[13:22.850 --> 13:24.670]  Well, if you can afford it like Nick can,
[13:24.710 --> 13:25.150]  then I agree.
[13:28.830 --> 13:30.070]  Hey, it's a minigame!
[13:31.830 --> 13:32.230]  Yeah!
[13:35.790 --> 13:36.930]  Oh, get this asshole!
[13:37.330 --> 13:37.650]  No.
[13:38.510 --> 13:39.290]  Get him out!
[13:40.110 --> 13:41.670]  We gotta work together!
[13:43.590 --> 13:44.730]  We're gonna pick some produce.
[13:46.890 --> 13:48.270]  Let's get that produce.
[13:49.690 --> 13:50.870]  Oh, what do we do?
[13:51.070 --> 13:51.950]  Alright, Geoff.
[13:53.010 --> 13:54.890]  Easy. You grab it and put it in the right thing.
[13:54.890 --> 13:56.410]  Do the buckets, yeah?
[13:58.470 --> 13:58.770]  Easy.
[13:58.850 --> 13:59.530]  Put that there.
[14:00.830 --> 14:02.310]  Okay, we got this.
[14:03.190 --> 14:04.590]  So you just worry about
[14:04.590 --> 14:05.890]  bananas and tomatoes.
[14:06.530 --> 14:08.250]  Alright, you got it figured out?
[14:08.510 --> 14:10.710]  You know what you got. I know what I got.
[14:13.130 --> 14:14.730]  I'll feed you, you feed me.
[14:16.050 --> 14:17.090]  Push me, pull me.
[14:17.130 --> 14:17.890]  Easy, easy, easy.
[14:17.930 --> 14:18.850]  Do you think we've got this, Geoff?
[14:19.170 --> 14:20.370]  Yeah, we got it.
[14:27.690 --> 14:28.470]  That's not us.
[14:29.170 --> 14:29.570]  There we are.
[14:30.590 --> 14:31.750]  Just give me melons, Geoff.
[14:32.070 --> 14:33.930]  Always give me melons.
[14:34.670 --> 14:35.710]  There you go.
[14:36.010 --> 14:39.310]  Take that banana.
[14:40.970 --> 14:42.190]  Don't tell me to take it.
[14:42.190 --> 14:43.230]  I know to take the banana.
[14:45.110 --> 14:46.010]  Geoff, get that.
[14:46.110 --> 14:47.390]  I just want to make sure you took that banana.
[14:48.310 --> 14:49.490]  You got a banana coming your way.
[14:50.670 --> 14:51.870]  What are you doing?
[14:52.330 --> 14:53.490]  Geoff, you put something in my hat.
[14:53.550 --> 14:54.270]  You blew it.
[14:55.590 --> 14:56.610]  What is happening?
[14:57.690 --> 14:59.810]  I was trying to get something and you put it on the thing.
[14:59.810 --> 15:00.330]  What are you doing?
[15:01.890 --> 15:02.610]  What happened?
[15:03.250 --> 15:04.410]  You won by one.
[15:04.510 --> 15:05.130]  That's right.
[15:08.450 --> 15:09.970]  I went to grab a melon
[15:09.970 --> 15:12.930]  and Geoff put a tomato in my hat.
[15:13.230 --> 15:14.690]  I wanted an apple, not a tomato.
[15:15.350 --> 15:15.950]  That was it.
[15:17.430 --> 15:18.770]  Maybe that's why we lost this
[15:18.770 --> 15:19.710]  because I don't know what fruit
[15:19.710 --> 15:20.410]  we've been dealing with.
[15:22.330 --> 15:23.110]  I can't.
[15:23.490 --> 15:25.110]  Where's the star in relation to me?
[15:26.570 --> 15:27.390]  That's a good question.
[15:27.770 --> 15:29.690]  Fuck off, Luigi, piece of shit.
[15:30.130 --> 15:32.670]  Thanks, bro.
[15:33.450 --> 15:33.970]  How many turns?
[15:34.170 --> 15:34.990]  Appreciate your help.
[15:35.450 --> 15:35.730]  Nine.
[15:35.730 --> 15:35.810]  Nine.
[15:37.590 --> 15:38.710]  What do my items do?
[15:40.310 --> 15:42.410]  What do my items do?
[15:42.710 --> 15:43.650]  You got the fight glove.
[15:44.890 --> 15:45.930]  We ain't risking it.
[15:46.190 --> 15:46.930]  We ain't risking it.
[15:47.290 --> 15:47.590]  Okay.
[15:50.630 --> 15:51.570]  It's getting heated
[15:51.570 --> 15:52.590]  in these last few rounds.
[15:52.610 --> 15:53.610]  I love it.
[15:55.250 --> 15:55.990]  Hit it!
[15:57.470 --> 15:59.010]  Okay, he's thinking about it.
[15:59.150 --> 15:59.570]  There we go.
[16:02.390 --> 16:03.970]  When you don't see it moving,
[16:03.970 --> 16:04.970]  and he's just standing there, it's like,
[16:05.050 --> 16:05.850]  what is he thinking?
[16:07.150 --> 16:08.130]  I'll go the wrong way.
[16:09.270 --> 16:10.370]  He's definitely going the wrong way.
[16:13.630 --> 16:14.890]  I think you'll get it here.
[16:15.050 --> 16:17.870]  Take me down to the star.
[16:19.570 --> 16:20.370]  Give me a stamp!
[16:21.230 --> 16:21.590]  Yeah!
[16:24.710 --> 16:25.890]  Look at my stamps!
[16:26.390 --> 16:27.650]  Someone said if Geoff wins,
[16:27.730 --> 16:29.090]  I'll get five subs. Well, good luck.
[16:30.210 --> 16:31.930]  DePaulo12, give it to me!
[16:32.530 --> 16:33.370]  BMTs, please.
[16:34.030 --> 16:34.510]  Finally!
[16:36.190 --> 16:37.030]  Oh, finally.
[16:41.950 --> 16:43.410]  You got a star.
[16:44.310 --> 16:47.390]  Was that Dilkong or Andrewkong?
[16:48.210 --> 16:49.370]  Dilkong's in chat, guys.
[16:49.690 --> 16:50.230]  Where's the next one?
[16:52.570 --> 16:53.150]  Show us.
[16:53.230 --> 16:54.470]  Right there in the middle.
[16:54.890 --> 16:57.310]  I can loop around.
[16:57.310 --> 16:59.190]  What kind of loot is that?
[16:59.210 --> 17:00.090]  I can loop around.
[17:00.450 --> 17:02.330]  You can just cross the bridge.
[17:03.650 --> 17:05.210]  No, I don't think you can go that way on the bridge,
[17:05.330 --> 17:07.230]  can he? I think the bridge only
[17:07.230 --> 17:08.370]  feeds this one way.
[17:13.630 --> 17:14.730]  He's trying to
[17:15.350 --> 17:17.350]  do quick maths and see what he
[17:17.350 --> 17:18.070]  can use.
[17:19.190 --> 17:21.070]  I want speed. I want distance.
[17:22.110 --> 17:23.150]  I need to move.
[17:24.510 --> 17:24.930]  No, look.
[17:24.930 --> 17:26.030]  Oh, it does. You're right.
[17:28.370 --> 17:30.690]  I can't go that way, so I gotta keep going down.
[17:30.910 --> 17:32.950]  Oh! Luck on my side!
[17:36.470 --> 17:37.250]  Let's see.
[17:38.330 --> 17:39.070]  What does that do?
[17:40.290 --> 17:42.150]  Orb an opponent to...
[17:42.780 --> 17:44.890]  Definitely use that right now.
[17:49.710 --> 17:51.370]  How far do I gotta go here?
[17:51.370 --> 17:52.370]  19.
[17:59.820 --> 18:01.620]  Put those... yeah.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.300]  On Geoff.
[18:06.620 --> 18:07.640]  Big money!
[18:08.540 --> 18:09.200]  Big money!
[18:10.020 --> 18:12.640]  Oh, good one!
[18:12.980 --> 18:14.180]  That's good, that's huge.
[18:15.260 --> 18:16.300]  Oh, and money. Nice.
[18:16.760 --> 18:17.360]  Damn.
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.120]  Get the money.
[18:28.920 --> 18:30.120]  Oh, it's in the shop.
[18:30.200 --> 18:30.860]  Double dice.
[18:33.120 --> 18:34.080]  It's weird it only shows
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.520]  the first one. I don't like that.
[18:36.160 --> 18:37.700]  What's the 200% thing again?
[18:38.660 --> 18:39.080]  No idea.
[18:39.800 --> 18:41.940]  I have no idea. I don't remember seeing that last time.
[18:42.880 --> 18:43.960]  It's use on an opponent
[18:43.960 --> 18:45.140]  to double the price of an item
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.560]  for them in stars.
[18:48.220 --> 18:50.100]  There's a two star steal trap there.
[18:51.740 --> 18:52.840]  He bought something already.
[18:52.840 --> 18:53.480]  Yeah.
[19:03.380 --> 19:04.220]  I'll take that.
[19:04.560 --> 19:06.240]  Damn it. Oh, you've been stamped
[19:06.240 --> 19:06.700]  already.
[19:09.680 --> 19:10.640]  Oh, Geoff.
[19:11.220 --> 19:11.940]  Oh, Geoff.
[19:12.220 --> 19:13.580]  Okay. Making sure?
[19:14.720 --> 19:15.560]  Double checking.
[19:17.560 --> 19:18.400]  I had a moment
[19:18.400 --> 19:19.240]  of fear for you.
[19:24.550 --> 19:25.670]  Do you think there's
[19:25.670 --> 19:27.610]  chocolate in these gold coins, or do you think they're just
[19:27.610 --> 19:29.690]  straight up gold? I think they're
[19:29.690 --> 19:31.970]  chocolate. I'd like to believe so.
[19:32.410 --> 19:33.770]  There's some fucking rough
[19:33.770 --> 19:34.710]  teeth otherwise.
[19:36.150 --> 19:37.550]  God damn, it's so freaking
[19:37.550 --> 19:37.950]  far.
[19:40.470 --> 19:41.850]  Do you have anything to move you?
[19:42.550 --> 19:42.850]  Nah.
[19:43.790 --> 19:45.470]  Got my boo bell. I use
[19:45.470 --> 19:45.970]  Miralax.
[19:48.150 --> 19:49.090]  It's pretty helpful.
[19:49.530 --> 19:50.630]  How is that? You like it?
[19:51.310 --> 19:53.490]  I take it every day of my life, sometimes
[19:53.490 --> 19:54.570]  twice if I'm feeling it.
[19:55.110 --> 19:57.530]  This is great. This is starting to sound like Stern content.
[19:57.530 --> 19:59.730]  This is great. Gavin's putting his hand in the glory hole.
[20:00.390 --> 20:01.570]  Five days a year.
[20:02.350 --> 20:03.470]  Stern riding the Miralax train?
[20:03.810 --> 20:05.050]  He was for a while.
[20:05.310 --> 20:07.430]  It was clearly
[20:07.430 --> 20:09.530]  an ad, but not an ad, but definitely an ad.
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.210]  Mine is medically necessary,
[20:13.470 --> 20:13.770]  unfortunately.
[20:15.950 --> 20:17.490]  I was prescribed Miralax.
[20:18.470 --> 20:19.470]  You get prescriptions
[20:19.470 --> 20:20.330]  straight to Miralax?
[20:20.710 --> 20:23.570]  I asked my gastroenterologist two years after
[20:23.570 --> 20:25.550]  he put me on it, and I was like, hey, how much longer do I have to do
[20:25.550 --> 20:27.430]  this Miralax thing for? And he goes, does it work?
[20:27.530 --> 20:29.790]  And I said, well, yeah. And he goes, don't ever stop.
[20:29.990 --> 20:31.030]  And I said, oh, Jesus.
[20:39.380 --> 20:40.140]  Oh, lucky
[20:40.140 --> 20:40.920]  space.
[20:41.660 --> 20:43.260]  Do any restaurants put
[20:44.360 --> 20:45.420]  Miralax in the food?
[20:47.720 --> 20:48.520]  I don't.
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.140]  Is that, like, legal?
[20:50.520 --> 20:52.000]  I think that's considered a health
[20:52.000 --> 20:53.220]  code violation. Oh.
[20:54.320 --> 20:54.720]  Maybe.
[20:57.060 --> 20:57.460]  Minigame.
[20:58.200 --> 20:58.600]  Minigame.
[21:01.600 --> 21:01.960]  Somebody
[21:01.960 --> 21:03.880]  asked what color was the OG Gerpler?
[21:04.160 --> 21:05.800]  It was red, right? That was the original one.
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.900]  Are you thinking, Gav,
[21:08.080 --> 21:09.700]  that you could launch a restaurant
[21:09.700 --> 21:11.940]  that exists for people
[21:11.940 --> 21:13.460]  that are constipated? Yeah.
[21:13.880 --> 21:15.800]  And then you could go with anything you eat.
[21:16.280 --> 21:17.780]  Like, I'll take a constipita,
[21:17.900 --> 21:18.980]  please. And they're like, no problem.
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.340]  Six hours later, you
[21:21.700 --> 21:22.360]  ride his rein.
[21:24.740 --> 21:25.760]  Exactly. Like how some
[21:25.760 --> 21:27.740]  stuff on the menu has a little thing, and you look at the legend,
[21:27.740 --> 21:28.740]  and it's, like, vegan.
[21:29.840 --> 21:31.020]  Alright, I'm feeling good about this.
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.920]  Alright, I need to get my rhythm here.
[21:35.420 --> 21:35.940]  You got it.
[21:36.020 --> 21:36.580]  Oh, shit.
[21:38.540 --> 21:38.860]  Okay.
[21:40.500 --> 21:41.240]  You got it?
[21:41.520 --> 21:43.840]  Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna wangle this wheel
[21:44.780 --> 21:45.720]  like you wouldn't believe.
[21:46.660 --> 21:47.740]  Oh, if I shake my butt
[21:47.740 --> 21:48.800]  while I do it, it's faster. Okay.
[21:50.440 --> 21:51.340]  You shake it.
[21:51.760 --> 21:52.820]  Oh, I'm standing up for this.
[21:53.800 --> 21:54.600]  Oh, that's a good call.
[21:54.600 --> 21:55.760]  Three...
[21:57.100 --> 22:00.620]  Two... One...
[22:00.620 --> 22:01.540]  Shake your butt!
[22:02.220 --> 22:03.420]  Come on, you idiot!
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.200]  Get up there!
[22:05.720 --> 22:07.180]  What are you doing?
[22:08.320 --> 22:09.480]  Come on!
[22:09.680 --> 22:10.320]  No!
[22:12.020 --> 22:14.520]  I can't believe it.
[22:14.520 --> 22:15.340]  I can't believe it.
[22:16.580 --> 22:17.800]  Half a second.
[22:19.080 --> 22:21.260]  That was the longest 12 seconds of my life.
[22:21.460 --> 22:22.760]  Oh, that hurt so bad.
[22:23.740 --> 22:24.860]  Dilkong's in the chat,
[22:24.860 --> 22:26.860]  guys. Show that Dilkong support.
[22:28.560 --> 22:28.960]  Ow!
[22:31.980 --> 22:33.400]  No, I mean no money!
[22:34.120 --> 22:34.520]  Yeah!
[22:35.560 --> 22:36.800]  How many turns are left?
[22:36.960 --> 22:37.040]  Two.
[22:38.820 --> 22:39.940]  Two turns left.
[22:42.600 --> 22:44.780]  I gotta save up to get this frickin'
[22:44.900 --> 22:45.180]  booger.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.940]  Somebody said we sold that in three minutes. That's not true.
[22:48.020 --> 22:49.120]  We sold that in four minutes.
[22:50.360 --> 22:51.700]  Don't give us too much credit, please.
[22:51.700 --> 22:53.740]  We averaged 1,000 gups
[22:53.740 --> 22:54.400]  a minute.
[22:55.560 --> 22:57.220]  AKA, you guys are nuts!
[22:57.680 --> 22:59.700]  Yeah, and we're working on getting a restock
[23:00.260 --> 23:01.760]  of 5,000
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.820]  potentially for the beginning of
[23:03.820 --> 23:05.880]  February, so I'm working on that right now.
[23:06.200 --> 23:06.360]  Yeah.
[23:07.400 --> 23:09.800]  And if we sell 5,000 on top
[23:09.800 --> 23:11.760]  of the 4,000 that fast, I don't know
[23:11.760 --> 23:12.420]  what the fuck to do.
[23:15.160 --> 23:15.640]  Okay.
[23:16.960 --> 23:17.720]  Big move.
[23:19.100 --> 23:19.700]  I need a nine.
[23:22.280 --> 23:23.080]  I need a nine.
[23:24.160 --> 23:25.800]  I guess I need a five or more, right?
[23:25.920 --> 23:27.080]  Five or more, because I'm getting plus five.
[23:28.280 --> 23:29.220]  50% chance!
[23:29.440 --> 23:30.060]  Five or more!
[23:31.660 --> 23:32.460]  For the Dilkong!
[23:33.820 --> 23:34.120]  No!
[23:38.570 --> 23:38.870]  Fuck!
[23:42.450 --> 23:47.530]  Oh, you got two stamps? You must be an idiot.
[23:47.730 --> 23:48.470]  That's okay. Here you go.
[23:48.650 --> 23:50.030]  Give me the coins. I'll take the coins.
[23:52.270 --> 23:53.590]  You must be an idiot.
[23:54.010 --> 23:57.970]  Oh dear.
[23:58.190 --> 23:59.430]  That's gonna hurt the comeback.
[23:59.910 --> 24:01.490]  Somebody said they felt that in their bones.
[24:03.290 --> 24:04.570]  Give me a new stamp sheet.
[24:04.930 --> 24:06.390]  This Kong got dilled, dude.
[24:06.870 --> 24:08.230]  Yeah, it was a pretty hard dill in there.
[24:08.750 --> 24:09.570]  Oh, nice!
[24:10.410 --> 24:12.210]  Are you kidding? Oh my god!
[24:12.290 --> 24:13.230]  I'm one away!
[24:13.670 --> 24:16.310]  And if you go that way, you land on a red square.
[24:16.950 --> 24:17.810]  Think about it.
[24:17.810 --> 24:18.770]  Ooh.
[24:19.230 --> 24:22.110]  I don't know if that was the wisest way to go,
[24:22.210 --> 24:22.530]  but that's alright.
[24:22.690 --> 24:24.350]  I just need Geoff Lowell.
[24:24.490 --> 24:27.450]  Geoff, you got item blocks.
[24:27.730 --> 24:28.290]  There you go.
[24:28.510 --> 24:31.150]  Oh yeah, that was a bad move.
[24:31.670 --> 24:33.190]  That was...
[24:33.810 --> 24:35.590]  Now, how many
[24:35.590 --> 24:37.550]  spaces do you need? You can just do
[24:38.630 --> 24:40.130]  10 and 10 or whatever.
[24:40.330 --> 24:40.970]  You can go crazy.
[24:41.130 --> 24:41.890]  Camp 10.
[24:42.610 --> 24:43.950]  You go crazy mode.
[24:43.950 --> 24:44.030]  10...
[24:45.470 --> 24:45.950]  8...
[24:45.950 --> 24:47.330]  There you go.
[24:49.070 --> 24:50.890]  Just make sure you go the right way.
[24:55.170 --> 24:56.390]  Okay, there you go.
[24:56.750 --> 24:57.570]  Look, Andrew, he got it.
[24:58.750 --> 25:00.470]  From the pause of the dill Kong.
[25:03.350 --> 25:03.830]  Finally.
[25:05.110 --> 25:07.870]  My stars are being returned to me.
[25:08.290 --> 25:08.470]  Thank you.
[25:08.910 --> 25:10.610]  Clark said who threw the baseball in the slow-mo
[25:10.610 --> 25:12.850]  Gerpler promo, Gavin revealed that that was Gavin.
[25:13.250 --> 25:14.290]  Gavin threw the baseball.
[25:14.670 --> 25:16.790]  It was my second throw and it was...
[25:16.790 --> 25:17.870]  I'm not good at throwing,
[25:18.750 --> 25:20.650]  but it was about as good as I was going to get.
[25:20.910 --> 25:22.790]  Did you just pretend it was Milly's face
[25:22.790 --> 25:23.050]  again?
[25:26.570 --> 25:28.570]  First time Gavin ever threw a baseball
[25:28.570 --> 25:30.550]  he hit my daughter in the mouth and gave her
[25:30.550 --> 25:30.930]  blue lip.
[25:32.010 --> 25:33.390]  Hey Geoff, can you...
[25:33.390 --> 25:36.910]  He just wanted to make sure you saw it, Andrew.
[25:37.190 --> 25:37.730]  Oh, I saw it.
[25:37.730 --> 25:39.450]  Oh, it's right behind me.
[25:39.670 --> 25:39.950]  Awesome.
[25:40.870 --> 25:42.890]  It wasn't a big deal. She was eventually fine.
[25:43.530 --> 25:45.470]  I think the tooth that was loose
[25:45.470 --> 25:46.330]  was already loose, right?
[25:49.010 --> 25:49.570]  Right?
[25:50.530 --> 25:51.090]  Right?
[25:51.770 --> 25:52.250]  Right?
[25:54.170 --> 25:55.830]  Permanent teeth go loose, right?
[25:56.510 --> 25:57.070]  Sometimes.
[26:01.030 --> 26:01.750]  Uh-oh.
[26:02.270 --> 26:03.390]  Ooh, creepy block.
[26:03.710 --> 26:05.530]  A little spooky block.
[26:07.810 --> 26:08.670]  Gotta go up.
[26:10.010 --> 26:10.490]  Okay.
[26:10.970 --> 26:11.450]  Alright.
[26:12.010 --> 26:14.030]  It was 35 to go up.
[26:14.110 --> 26:15.050]  It's only 21 this way.
[26:15.230 --> 26:16.210]  Oh, really? Okay.
[26:16.570 --> 26:18.610]  I think it's because you can use the lift.
[26:19.210 --> 26:19.510]  Yeah.
[26:25.000 --> 26:25.960]  Good stamps.
[26:27.220 --> 26:27.680]  Nice.
[26:28.640 --> 26:30.880]  Damn, fill him up.
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.280]  Straight into my brain.
[26:33.740 --> 26:35.740]  I just still can't believe...
[26:35.740 --> 26:37.120]  I mean, even though we sold something for
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.100]  four minutes only, I can't believe that went
[26:39.100 --> 26:41.380]  smoother than it did when we had a whole
[26:41.380 --> 26:43.160]  giant company behind us.
[26:43.420 --> 26:45.080]  Well, we have a new giant company
[26:45.080 --> 26:45.600]  behind us.
[26:47.000 --> 26:47.440]  Giant.
[26:49.840 --> 26:50.720]  I'm emailing
[26:50.720 --> 26:52.900]  with the guy who owns it
[26:52.900 --> 26:55.100]  and he's going, I don't know that we ever had anything go
[26:55.100 --> 26:56.400]  this way. This is fucking crazy.
[26:59.100 --> 27:01.160]  He compared us to a release
[27:01.160 --> 27:02.800]  they did for Radiohead.
[27:04.060 --> 27:05.140]  Are you fucking
[27:05.140 --> 27:06.860]  serious? That's insane.
[27:07.220 --> 27:09.040]  That comparable launch that I've seen that fast
[27:09.040 --> 27:11.060]  was a Radiohead moon-shaped
[27:11.060 --> 27:13.100]  pool release. I don't know what that
[27:13.100 --> 27:13.440]  means.
[27:15.460 --> 27:17.080]  I will say, I did
[27:17.080 --> 27:19.040]  get the look, not in Natalie's eyes
[27:19.040 --> 27:20.260]  because she's been there with us, you know?
[27:20.320 --> 27:22.920]  But when you and I were having
[27:22.920 --> 27:24.800]  that final meeting where we were like, listen, we're just really...
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.480]  this has to go smoothly.
[27:26.740 --> 27:29.280]  I know we sound like we're crazy here, but it's
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.040]  going to go fast and it's going to be...
[27:31.040 --> 27:32.920]  And they give us that look like, sure buddy,
[27:33.080 --> 27:34.820]  we've heard this a million times.
[27:35.620 --> 27:36.820]  They've all emailed like,
[27:37.020 --> 27:39.060]  holy shit, what the fuck?
[27:39.380 --> 27:40.960]  It's like, you know, we had to meet...
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.860]  Alex is the person we've been working with really closely.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.940]  Natalie is sourcing our stuff and she's who we worked
[27:44.940 --> 27:47.180]  with at Rooster Teeth. She knows how this goes
[27:47.180 --> 27:49.000]  and I think that she's probably been pretty
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.980]  clear about it and then everyone is like
[27:50.980 --> 27:53.140]  waiting to see and then it happened.
[27:53.500 --> 27:55.040]  And it's like, oh, this is
[27:55.040 --> 27:56.920]  a real...
[27:57.720 --> 27:58.520]  crazy, crazy.
[27:58.520 --> 28:00.260]  I can't believe it. I'm so happy.
[28:01.920 --> 28:02.480]  Ooh!
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.600]  Us against the
[28:04.600 --> 28:05.060]  dill.
[28:06.300 --> 28:07.760]  On again, off again.
[28:09.020 --> 28:10.300]  On again, off again.
[28:10.380 --> 28:12.040]  Crush again, off again.
[28:12.940 --> 28:13.920]  It's like my friendship with Andrew.
[28:14.480 --> 28:15.060]  What am I doing?
[28:15.540 --> 28:17.600]  It's a real will they, won't they.
[28:18.660 --> 28:19.080]  Uh oh.
[28:19.540 --> 28:21.120]  Oh, it's this one.
[28:21.260 --> 28:22.580]  Okay, okay, okay.
[28:23.100 --> 28:26.300]  Wow, that was a...
[28:26.300 --> 28:27.000]  Uh.
[28:29.300 --> 28:30.360]  Alright, let's get this win.
[28:31.040 --> 28:31.720]  Yeah, let's do it.
[28:33.700 --> 28:35.760]  Ain't no stopping the dill!
[28:36.240 --> 28:36.900]  High platform.
[28:37.200 --> 28:39.060]  Oh my god.
[28:39.900 --> 28:41.040]  He dropped it right on me.
[28:42.460 --> 28:43.580]  Watch out, Geoff!
[28:43.920 --> 28:45.220]  He boxed me in!
[28:46.040 --> 28:46.980]  What am I supposed to do?
[28:47.160 --> 28:47.600]  Keep going.
[28:48.860 --> 28:49.740]  You can win it.
[28:51.880 --> 28:53.560]  How much longer do I gotta go for?
[28:53.560 --> 28:54.680]  Ten seconds.
[28:56.680 --> 28:58.180]  Keep working it.
[28:58.320 --> 28:59.320]  God, fuck.
[28:59.940 --> 29:01.860]  Have you ever seen such a platform
[29:01.860 --> 29:03.040]  master in your life?
[29:03.280 --> 29:04.300]  That was amazing!
[29:04.300 --> 29:04.560]  No!
[29:07.310 --> 29:09.360]  How did Geoff do that?
[29:11.280 --> 29:13.260]  Geoff, I'm blown away.
[29:13.560 --> 29:14.440]  That was incredible.
[29:15.320 --> 29:17.280]  Wow, great job.
[29:17.440 --> 29:18.220]  Thank you, thank you.
[29:19.200 --> 29:20.380]  That's some bullshit.
[29:20.380 --> 29:21.360]  That is.
[29:21.660 --> 29:23.660]  Dude, I'm feeling...
[29:23.660 --> 29:26.100]  I'm feeling the only kind of capable
[29:26.100 --> 29:28.180]  and confident you can feel after
[29:28.180 --> 29:30.500]  selling 4,000 plastic cups in four minutes.
[29:31.660 --> 29:32.960]  I'm riding a high right now.
[29:33.320 --> 29:34.500]  I'm operating in a...
[29:34.500 --> 29:36.560]  Well, it's time to get
[29:36.560 --> 29:38.200]  fucking real in this game.
[29:39.260 --> 29:39.860]  Uh oh.
[29:40.040 --> 29:40.680]  The fight glove.
[29:42.600 --> 29:44.220]  Let's get fucking real.
[29:44.300 --> 29:45.740]  It comes down to this.
[29:47.340 --> 29:49.360]  Bring it on.
[29:49.360 --> 29:50.480]  It's a star.
[29:50.760 --> 29:51.980]  It slapped me.
[29:52.380 --> 29:54.120]  It did, it slapped you in the forehead.
[29:54.580 --> 29:57.840]  I'm about to slap you with a banana peel.
[30:01.520 --> 30:03.640]  How do we duel?
[30:04.760 --> 30:06.800]  Watching Geoff use that cup energy
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.260]  on that last mini game was nuts.
[30:08.640 --> 30:09.260]  It's pretty crazy.
[30:10.340 --> 30:11.840]  And then you ground pound.
[30:12.480 --> 30:12.880]  Oh!
[30:13.880 --> 30:16.400]  You don't want to get slapped by your own slapper.
[30:16.400 --> 30:18.020]  My god.
[30:18.160 --> 30:18.880]  Alright.
[30:20.040 --> 30:22.200]  Oh, this sucks.
[30:22.260 --> 30:23.900]  Yeah, this just feels weird.
[30:23.960 --> 30:26.380]  You are immediately fucked.
[30:26.840 --> 30:28.820]  You have to pretend like...
[30:28.820 --> 30:30.560]  Think about when they're going
[30:30.560 --> 30:31.860]  and make sure you jump it.
[30:32.260 --> 30:33.300]  Think about it missing.
[30:34.660 --> 30:34.920]  Oh!
[30:35.660 --> 30:36.440]  Sausage dip.
[30:38.280 --> 30:40.240]  Somebody just brought up...
[30:40.240 --> 30:40.580]  Fake it.
[30:41.500 --> 30:43.560]  A really interesting question, Eric.
[30:43.560 --> 30:45.040]  We'll get into it after this duel.
[30:45.420 --> 30:45.900]  Shit!
[30:46.780 --> 30:47.780]  Oh my god!
[30:48.920 --> 30:50.720]  Andrew, you gotta do him!
[30:52.680 --> 30:53.040]  No!
[30:56.820 --> 30:58.540]  Now we're getting into it.
[31:01.000 --> 31:02.560]  I can just wait it out, bitch.
[31:03.460 --> 31:05.120]  Oh, he's gone full bitch.
[31:07.440 --> 31:08.720]  Nick can just wait it out.
[31:08.720 --> 31:09.200]  Oh no!
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.780]  He got his side!
[31:11.200 --> 31:13.120]  The comeback!
[31:13.720 --> 31:15.340]  The real comeback!
[31:16.840 --> 31:17.040]  No!
[31:18.660 --> 31:23.280]  Oh my god.
[31:23.560 --> 31:25.360]  I'm so pissed right now.
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.700]  Give me the star!
[31:29.660 --> 31:31.430]  First place!
[31:32.160 --> 31:33.400]  Blast the first
[31:33.400 --> 31:34.800]  three turns!
[31:35.740 --> 31:36.420]  Wow.
[31:36.420 --> 31:38.280]  Andrew's gonna throw his voice out.
[31:38.760 --> 31:44.180]  Oh, the shop closed?
[31:44.420 --> 31:44.940]  That's...
[31:46.120 --> 31:47.040]  Final turn.
[31:47.500 --> 31:49.380]  Where are we going?
[31:50.860 --> 31:51.480]  Oh, hey Mario!
[31:51.980 --> 31:52.660]  What's up, man?
[31:54.900 --> 31:56.180]  Hey, remember the 80s?
[31:56.380 --> 31:56.580]  No!
[32:03.520 --> 32:04.860]  Oh my god.
[32:09.060 --> 32:10.200]  What you doing, Geoff?
[32:10.540 --> 32:11.400]  What are you doing, Geoff?
[32:11.400 --> 32:13.940]  Maybe see if there's a chance time along the way.
[32:14.540 --> 32:14.880]  What'd he say?
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.140]  He said to look for a chance time.
[32:18.520 --> 32:19.680]  Yeah, like see if there's any good spaces
[32:19.680 --> 32:21.540]  that you want to land on in the next ten spaces.
[32:21.560 --> 32:22.680]  He's using it on the creepy dice.
[32:24.220 --> 32:25.160]  Who's it gonna be, though?
[32:25.180 --> 32:25.960]  Who am I gonna use it on?
[32:26.100 --> 32:27.160]  Who's it gonna be?
[32:29.080 --> 32:29.440]  Oh!
[32:30.840 --> 32:31.780]  Just totally random.
[32:33.280 --> 32:34.000]  Uh-huh.
[32:34.360 --> 32:35.340]  Just happened to be Nick.
[32:35.800 --> 32:36.480]  Felt pretty random.
[32:38.340 --> 32:39.300]  Felt pretty...
[32:39.300 --> 32:40.560]  That's a random I could get behind.
[32:43.340 --> 32:44.200]  I'm having fun.
[32:44.460 --> 32:45.400]  I'm having a great time.
[32:47.440 --> 32:48.160]  Go right.
[32:48.300 --> 32:50.060]  I can't believe we had this game.
[32:50.880 --> 32:51.520]  I wanna do something.
[32:51.700 --> 32:53.940]  Very cool of Nintendo.
[32:54.440 --> 32:54.920]  Incredible.
[32:55.080 --> 32:56.780]  The most un-Nintendo thing ever.
[32:57.200 --> 32:58.220]  It really is.
[32:58.840 --> 33:01.300]  Oh, I know what you can do.
[33:01.560 --> 33:01.860]  Uh-huh.
[33:01.860 --> 33:02.720]  Uh-huh.
[33:05.360 --> 33:08.220]  We're an hour into this stream almost
[33:08.220 --> 33:09.840]  and we haven't started this
[33:09.840 --> 33:10.460]  play yet.
[33:10.480 --> 33:12.060]  He said it was only coins!
[33:12.640 --> 33:13.840]  He lied!
[33:16.200 --> 33:18.120]  If you have enough money,
[33:18.240 --> 33:18.820]  it's not coins.
[33:20.640 --> 33:21.360]  You're ridiculous.
[33:21.800 --> 33:23.420]  You know who it's gotta be.
[33:24.500 --> 33:25.800]  We're gonna play another game
[33:25.800 --> 33:26.420]  after this.
[33:28.300 --> 33:29.860]  That's a funny pick right there.
[33:29.860 --> 33:31.060]  Uh-huh.
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.600]  Can't help but notice a little golden pipe
[33:33.600 --> 33:34.680]  in someone's pocket.
[33:36.260 --> 33:38.160]  It's still not enough for me to take the lead.
[33:38.280 --> 33:39.140]  That's a great point.
[33:39.840 --> 33:40.800]  He's got the pipe.
[33:41.340 --> 33:42.560]  See why I didn't get a golden pipe?
[33:43.920 --> 33:45.060]  Pick it from Nick.
[33:45.060 --> 33:46.320]  I didn't even notice the golden pipe.
[33:46.380 --> 33:48.060]  You're playing on a whole other level.
[33:50.040 --> 33:51.740]  Don't do a random play to win!
[33:52.060 --> 33:52.960]  Random's too dangerous.
[33:53.580 --> 33:54.540]  We're playing to win here.
[33:54.840 --> 33:57.580]  You gotta chop Nick down at the knees
[33:57.580 --> 33:58.200]  with that pipe.
[33:58.660 --> 33:59.720]  Nick's gonna end with three.
[34:01.080 --> 34:01.960]  It's gotta be done.
[34:03.800 --> 34:05.520]  This is gonna be a wild end.
[34:06.180 --> 34:06.440]  Yeah.
[34:11.460 --> 34:13.260]  Three people with three stars
[34:13.260 --> 34:14.480]  going into the bonus rounds?
[34:14.860 --> 34:14.960]  Yep.
[34:16.720 --> 34:17.820]  Damn, crazy.
[34:19.600 --> 34:20.180]  Cheers, Nick!
[34:21.620 --> 34:22.120]  Cheers, Gavin.
[34:23.640 --> 34:24.940]  I'm not gonna forget that.
[34:25.180 --> 34:25.840]  Oh no!
[34:25.840 --> 34:27.260]  We got a second game later.
[34:27.720 --> 34:29.620]  That's true. Alright, let's roll a 20.
[34:30.820 --> 34:31.300]  Shit!
[34:35.740 --> 34:36.460]  I never got
[34:36.460 --> 34:37.700]  to redeem my four stamps.
[34:38.540 --> 34:39.900]  Oh, you didn't!
[34:41.160 --> 34:42.320]  That's a real bummer.
[34:42.640 --> 34:42.980]  Damn!
[34:44.940 --> 34:46.260]  Oh, we're playing for an ally
[34:46.260 --> 34:46.840]  right now.
[34:47.300 --> 34:49.700]  Oh my god, if I win him!
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.040]  Oh no!
[34:51.500 --> 34:54.020]  It's Bowser Jr.? Oh, Nick could win
[34:54.020 --> 34:55.360]  and make something happen here.
[34:55.360 --> 34:56.500]  Oh, give him to me!
[34:56.900 --> 34:58.420]  Oh shit!
[35:00.380 --> 35:01.260]  So the question
[35:01.260 --> 35:03.020]  somebody asked, Eric,
[35:03.400 --> 35:05.360]  was the 5,000 Gurplers that are
[35:05.360 --> 35:06.860]  coming in February. Two questions, actually.
[35:06.980 --> 35:09.140]  That's what we're hoping for. It's not totally
[35:09.140 --> 35:10.980]  confirmed yet. I just want to be really clear.
[35:11.220 --> 35:12.480]  We're working on it.
[35:14.340 --> 35:15.220]  But, assuming
[35:15.220 --> 35:17.400]  we buy 5,000 and they're available in early February
[35:17.400 --> 35:18.000]  like we think,
[35:19.700 --> 35:20.940]  will they be the same color?
[35:21.480 --> 35:23.320]  Yes. Okay, so these will be
[35:23.320 --> 35:25.280]  the initial smokey gray
[35:25.280 --> 35:27.180]  or whatever we called it. Yes, they will be the same ones.
[35:27.360 --> 35:29.260]  Alright, and the other question is, will we limit
[35:29.260 --> 35:30.760]  the number on the second order?
[35:31.660 --> 35:32.980]  Since we didn't for the first.
[35:33.460 --> 35:34.440]  That's a bigger conversation.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.100]  I think we should discuss it. I'm open to it, though.
[35:39.720 --> 35:40.080]  I'm...
[35:40.080 --> 35:41.280]  We got a sausage talk
[35:41.280 --> 35:43.300]  coming up. That's true. I'm open to it.
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.160]  We should talk about it then.
[35:44.860 --> 35:47.360]  Alright, let's put a pin in it and not think about it
[35:47.360 --> 35:48.440]  or discuss it until then.
[35:48.980 --> 35:49.180]  Okay.
[35:50.780 --> 35:51.440]  Alright, so
[35:51.440 --> 35:52.520]  if Nick wins this,
[35:53.260 --> 35:55.520]  he can buy two stars
[35:55.520 --> 35:56.820]  with his pipe.
[35:56.860 --> 35:58.040]  We just can't let him win.
[35:59.040 --> 36:00.480]  I think you have to let me win.
[36:01.980 --> 36:03.080]  Yeah, think about that.
[36:04.040 --> 36:05.100]  Oh, Gavin's got the advantage.
[36:05.200 --> 36:05.580]  We should kill him.
[36:07.260 --> 36:08.800]  I can also, by the way,
[36:08.900 --> 36:11.080]  look at the orders and I didn't see
[36:11.080 --> 36:12.540]  a ton of people buying more than one.
[36:12.740 --> 36:14.700]  The vast, vast majority of the orders
[36:14.700 --> 36:15.640]  are people buying one.
[36:15.640 --> 36:17.120]  There are people going like,
[36:17.240 --> 36:19.000]  well, this person said they bought 168.
[36:19.140 --> 36:20.000]  That didn't happen.
[36:21.320 --> 36:23.520]  Almost every order was somebody
[36:23.520 --> 36:25.500]  buying one. Somebody's lying to you
[36:25.500 --> 36:27.500]  on the internet. I know that's gonna blow your
[36:27.500 --> 36:28.960]  mind, but that's what's happening.
[36:30.220 --> 36:30.880]  Hey, I got a point.
[36:31.800 --> 36:32.520]  Fine with that.
[36:33.380 --> 36:35.680]  That's one point per round? Holy sh...
[36:36.220 --> 36:36.900]  Give me that.
[36:37.500 --> 36:38.860]  Give me that chicken. Get the chicken.
[36:39.280 --> 36:40.600]  No! Chicken!
[36:41.080 --> 36:42.040]  Is that it already?
[36:45.100 --> 36:46.380]  Alright, collect hammers.
[36:46.600 --> 36:47.520]  Ow, shit!
[36:48.120 --> 36:48.940]  I collected one.
[36:49.260 --> 36:49.740]  Dammit!
[36:50.780 --> 36:52.280]  Oh, everyone collected one.
[36:52.880 --> 36:54.120]  Are you kidding me?
[36:55.260 --> 36:56.040]  Okay. Break balloons.
[36:56.660 --> 36:57.920]  Where are the balloons? Can I break balls?
[36:58.060 --> 36:58.260]  No!
[37:01.420 --> 37:02.240]  Fucking beat up
[37:02.240 --> 37:02.680]  the guy!
[37:06.560 --> 37:07.380]  Uh-oh. Run.
[37:07.600 --> 37:08.940]  Run from the punch ghosts.
[37:10.180 --> 37:11.420]  Oh my god.
[37:11.460 --> 37:12.940]  Oh my god. They did not go
[37:12.940 --> 37:14.120]  after Geoff at all.
[37:14.480 --> 37:16.940]  Mario in there throwing hands.
[37:17.100 --> 37:18.080]  Throwing hands!
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.880]  Alright, collect bullet bills.
[37:22.000 --> 37:22.320]  Ah!
[37:22.740 --> 37:23.880]  Holy shit!
[37:24.780 --> 37:25.700]  That's unfortunate.
[37:29.100 --> 37:30.460]  Calm down, Mario.
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.940]  Ow, I keep getting lamped by Mario.
[37:32.940 --> 37:34.680]  Wow. Lamped? No!
[37:35.920 --> 37:36.560]  Wow.
[37:36.560 --> 37:38.140]  Hit hard on that one.
[37:38.460 --> 37:39.980]  Gavin is rocking here.
[37:40.120 --> 37:42.740]  I missed the Luigi minigame where everyone looks stupid.
[37:43.880 --> 37:44.600]  This one
[37:44.600 --> 37:46.320]  is wild. The three point heads
[37:46.320 --> 37:47.860]  die is pretty crazy.
[37:48.040 --> 37:50.620]  Yeah, that's really nuts. You'd really have to
[37:50.620 --> 37:51.180]  bungle it.
[37:53.380 --> 37:54.580]  Oh, now we're just fighting?
[37:55.960 --> 37:56.760]  Final round?
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.080]  Uh-oh. Is it worth more points?
[37:59.040 --> 37:59.300]  Run.
[38:00.020 --> 38:01.220]  Stop hitting me, Nick!
[38:03.760 --> 38:05.020]  Oh my god.
[38:05.020 --> 38:05.180]  Oh.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.440]  Nick, stop hitting me!
[38:10.440 --> 38:11.020]  He's
[38:11.020 --> 38:13.200]  jabbing. It's infuriating.
[38:13.500 --> 38:14.760]  Oh my god. Oh shit!
[38:17.040 --> 38:18.920]  Oh my god, Gavin
[38:18.920 --> 38:20.320]  ran away with it too.
[38:20.380 --> 38:20.840]  Oh!
[38:24.060 --> 38:24.640]  Insane.
[38:25.500 --> 38:26.380]  Not quite, buddy.
[38:30.180 --> 38:30.640]  Oh.
[38:31.580 --> 38:32.260]  Good win, Gavin.
[38:33.300 --> 38:35.220]  Thanks. I think this is the only time
[38:35.220 --> 38:36.180]  I've had a little guy.
[38:37.160 --> 38:38.940]  And we have another game after this.
[38:39.300 --> 38:39.700]  Yup.
[38:40.620 --> 38:41.140]  Yeah.
[38:43.860 --> 38:45.140]  Final minigame, I think.
[38:46.400 --> 38:46.920]  Uh...
[38:46.920 --> 38:48.880]  So the other one, we're doing a 35 turn? Is that right?
[38:49.440 --> 38:49.780]  What?
[38:50.160 --> 38:52.700]  I don't think so now.
[38:55.320 --> 38:56.980]  That's like four hours, I think.
[38:57.380 --> 38:58.440]  It's a really long time.
[38:59.100 --> 39:00.540]  We're already an hour into this.
[39:00.920 --> 39:01.560]  Yeah, no kidding.
[39:05.120 --> 39:05.560]  Oh.
[39:06.440 --> 39:07.320]  Ooh, lucky.
[39:12.770 --> 39:13.450]  People said
[39:13.450 --> 39:14.510]  we gotta go to a 5-on-1.
[39:15.430 --> 39:16.310]  Insane. Nope.
[39:17.710 --> 39:18.590]  Not today!
[39:24.010 --> 39:25.250]  Where'd you get breakfast today, Eric?
[39:26.750 --> 39:27.550]  Uh, the spot
[39:27.550 --> 39:28.550]  that we went to before.
[39:29.430 --> 39:29.910]  Me, you, and Gavin.
[39:31.570 --> 39:33.050]  Oh. Nice. Nice.
[39:33.050 --> 39:33.390]  Yep.
[39:34.130 --> 39:34.950]  A little out of the way for you.
[39:36.970 --> 39:38.310]  Yeah, but I like it.
[39:38.650 --> 39:40.990]  There aren't a lot of places like that.
[39:41.450 --> 39:42.170]  You're right about that.
[39:42.530 --> 39:43.450]  Oh, you're gonna use the pipe?
[39:45.090 --> 39:46.990]  Everything's like a trendy spot.
[39:48.290 --> 39:49.110]  Nothing's like that anymore.
[39:49.910 --> 39:51.030]  Yeah, you're right about that.
[39:52.950 --> 39:54.590]  This will put Nick into second.
[39:56.790 --> 39:57.190]  Japanese.
[40:01.100 --> 40:01.500]  Japanese.
[40:03.520 --> 40:04.300]  Freakin' low.
[40:05.140 --> 40:05.540]  Box.
[40:06.080 --> 40:06.620]  Excuse me?
[40:07.620 --> 40:08.780]  The box that you gave me.
[40:09.060 --> 40:10.200]  Oh, it was random, dude.
[40:10.340 --> 40:10.880]  What am I gonna do?
[40:14.460 --> 40:14.860]  NailsnailyCZ
[40:14.860 --> 40:15.380]  says,
[40:15.820 --> 40:18.200]  Gavin, behind the scenes footage of the Gerpla trailer.
[40:18.460 --> 40:20.220]  I actually do have behind the scenes footage.
[40:20.280 --> 40:21.780]  Do you really? Oh, that's awesome!
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.240]  Should we put it on the Patreon?
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.940]  We should definitely put it on the Patreon.
[40:24.940 --> 40:26.880]  Oh, that'd be cool.
[40:27.420 --> 40:28.280]  Oh, man.
[40:29.240 --> 40:30.100]  Alright, here we go.
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.860]  Someone in the crowd said,
[40:33.160 --> 40:33.520]  not me.
[40:37.010 --> 40:38.610]  Geoff, somebody asked, what's your blue sky?
[40:39.250 --> 40:39.710]  I don't know.
[40:40.450 --> 40:42.390]  What name did you pick when you typed it in?
[40:43.290 --> 40:44.170]  Oh, uh,
[40:44.170 --> 40:45.470]  LilGeoffy, I think?
[40:50.890 --> 40:51.730]  Final minigame.
[40:52.330 --> 40:54.770]  I think the older I get, the younger my friends are gonna be.
[40:54.770 --> 40:56.350]  The man I need to take money from!
[40:56.510 --> 40:58.870]  I don't see LilGeoffy on here
[40:58.870 --> 40:59.510]  at all.
[41:00.290 --> 41:01.910]  Well, that's the name I wrote in.
[41:02.630 --> 41:04.730]  Maybe Geoff Ramsey, but I just wrote
[41:04.730 --> 41:06.550]  LilGeoffy as my name or something?
[41:06.610 --> 41:08.730]  I don't know. I think he signed up on Truth instead.
[41:13.570 --> 41:14.870]  What the hell?
[41:16.870 --> 41:17.270]  Pedal.
[41:18.090 --> 41:19.250]  Oh, okay, Geoff, we got this.
[41:20.750 --> 41:21.390]  Oh, I found it.
[41:21.390 --> 41:24.050]  You go too far into the...
[41:24.950 --> 41:27.210]  your name is Regulation Geoff.
[41:27.890 --> 41:29.490]  You picked Regulation Geoff,
[41:29.570 --> 41:30.470]  you dunce.
[41:30.830 --> 41:32.230]  I did that months ago.
[41:32.430 --> 41:34.810]  I wrote LilGeoffy today when I set it up.
[41:34.950 --> 41:36.690]  Okay, we figured it out.
[41:37.050 --> 41:38.870]  LilGeoffy is like the... doesn't matter.
[41:39.630 --> 41:41.430]  It says it somewhere, doesn't it?
[41:41.770 --> 41:42.450]  Yes, it does.
[41:42.810 --> 41:43.570]  Okay, thank you.
[41:44.870 --> 41:47.350]  So when I said, I don't know, I wrote LilGeoffy today...
[41:47.350 --> 41:49.670]  Hey, LilGeoffy, can we hit start?
[41:50.390 --> 41:52.450]  I'm fucking trying to win the practice.
[41:52.950 --> 41:54.830]  Alright, so Geoff, if we're going too far,
[41:54.990 --> 41:56.370]  if we're veering right too much,
[41:56.530 --> 41:57.330]  you stop.
[41:57.890 --> 41:58.130]  Okay.
[42:04.950 --> 42:06.550]  You more, you more, you more.
[42:07.130 --> 42:08.210]  Go, go, Nick.
[42:08.370 --> 42:09.890]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[42:10.650 --> 42:12.230]  You, you, you.
[42:13.110 --> 42:13.950]  I'm going, I'm going.
[42:14.270 --> 42:15.070]  Well, we lost.
[42:15.710 --> 42:16.550]  Don't stop!
[42:16.910 --> 42:18.610]  I didn't stop, I'm still going!
[42:18.610 --> 42:19.510]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[42:19.530 --> 42:21.510]  Oh god, he's going to waylay us!
[42:21.570 --> 42:23.370]  You guys...
[42:23.930 --> 42:25.770]  You guys suck.
[42:26.490 --> 42:26.890]  Teamwork.
[42:28.450 --> 42:29.190]  Yeah, I don't know what that was.
[42:30.470 --> 42:31.910]  We were stuck on the thing?
[42:32.370 --> 42:33.750]  I don't know what that was.
[42:34.730 --> 42:36.170]  I don't know what that was.
[42:36.330 --> 42:37.010]  Look at the spins.
[42:37.750 --> 42:39.270]  One side was spinning, one side was not.
[42:39.650 --> 42:41.170]  Oh, that is recorded.
[42:42.930 --> 42:44.110]  It is recorded.
[42:44.590 --> 42:46.610]  But Nick has...
[42:47.270 --> 42:48.770]  That is also true.
[42:49.130 --> 42:52.090]  Now let's find out who would have won three weeks ago.
[42:53.030 --> 42:54.030]  Here we go.
[42:54.710 --> 42:55.630]  It's only been three weeks.
[42:56.030 --> 42:56.850]  Oh, maybe a month.
[42:58.650 --> 42:59.030]  Dilkong.
[43:00.070 --> 43:01.110]  Who will be the winner?
[43:01.190 --> 43:03.470]  First, let's check out what the star distribution looked like throughout the game.
[43:03.550 --> 43:04.810]  Oh, this is going to be wild for Dilkong.
[43:05.710 --> 43:08.630]  I hit my HMI switcher for a second and didn't realize it.
[43:08.730 --> 43:10.650]  It just scared the dicks out of me.
[43:10.730 --> 43:11.110]  Nothing.
[43:11.930 --> 43:13.130]  At the very end.
[43:13.130 --> 43:13.750]  Yep.
[43:15.370 --> 43:17.210]  Mario really pitched in here.
[43:17.970 --> 43:19.450]  Wow, Nick woke up.
[43:19.610 --> 43:20.990]  Yeah, watch Nick go.
[43:21.710 --> 43:22.470]  And then what happens?
[43:23.230 --> 43:24.150]  Oh my.
[43:25.410 --> 43:26.070]  What an ending.
[43:27.250 --> 43:28.970]  Bonus stars.
[43:29.210 --> 43:30.170]  Bullshit time.
[43:30.870 --> 43:32.190]  Dilkong, Dilkong.
[43:32.630 --> 43:33.110]  The most fruit.
[43:35.390 --> 43:36.990]  That's going to be Geoff.
[43:38.130 --> 43:39.370]  Oh, it's Geoff.
[43:40.090 --> 43:41.010]  Holy shit.
[43:41.010 --> 43:42.310]  It's three stars apiece.
[43:42.570 --> 43:44.230]  This is crazy.
[43:44.450 --> 43:45.750]  Rub that little belly, baby.
[43:46.150 --> 43:47.890]  Now anyone can win.
[43:47.930 --> 43:48.650]  Oh shit.
[43:49.230 --> 43:50.310]  Is it me?
[43:51.590 --> 43:51.910]  Yes!
[43:52.450 --> 43:56.210]  Oh my god.
[43:56.770 --> 43:58.090]  Wow, Gavin.
[43:58.810 --> 44:01.070]  Oh, I'm fucking believable.
[44:02.230 --> 44:02.430]  What?
[44:03.650 --> 44:04.570]  That's it?
[44:04.690 --> 44:05.530]  There's only two?
[44:06.150 --> 44:08.490]  Listen to him scream.
[44:08.490 --> 44:10.650]  Listen to him scream.
[44:11.090 --> 44:11.650]  No!
[44:12.950 --> 44:14.830]  Gavin with the win at the end.
[44:15.090 --> 44:16.510]  No, you didn't win shit.
[44:16.810 --> 44:18.050]  I can't believe I won.
[44:20.570 --> 44:22.390]  What a little horse pit.
[44:22.430 --> 44:23.950]  It was the steal.
[44:24.150 --> 44:25.570]  The star steal at the end.
[44:25.810 --> 44:27.430]  That last turn boo won it for me.
[44:28.230 --> 44:30.190]  Oh, look at that.
[44:30.710 --> 44:32.590]  Everybody had three stars.
[44:32.890 --> 44:33.830]  Like Gavin.
[44:34.250 --> 44:36.330]  That was the closest game I've ever played, I think.
[44:36.330 --> 44:38.170]  The star steal at the end.
[44:38.390 --> 44:39.730]  Oh yeah, we did a chance time.
[44:39.870 --> 44:42.150]  Oh, Nick won the minigames.
[44:42.150 --> 44:42.570]  Oh, cool.
[44:46.910 --> 44:47.270]  Oh.
[44:47.650 --> 44:49.810]  4,000 Gerpolas sold, then this?
[44:51.830 --> 44:54.550]  What a day for Gavin, but not for the fans.
[44:58.030 --> 45:00.570]  Alright, let's see what everyone got.
[45:01.550 --> 45:04.530]  Oh man, my arm is still hurt from jacking off earlier.
[45:05.710 --> 45:07.290]  My elbow is killing me.
[45:07.650 --> 45:08.750]  My forearm.
[45:09.030 --> 45:09.770]  Oh, you got Cummer's elbow?
[45:10.830 --> 45:11.950]  Yeah, I got Cummer's elbow.
[45:12.350 --> 45:13.990]  I feel like I pulled a muscle, I didn't know it was there.
[45:14.750 --> 45:15.790]  The Cummer's elbow.
[45:16.030 --> 45:18.450]  It's the fucking worst to find out about a muscle when you pull it.
[45:18.790 --> 45:19.710]  Oh my god.
[45:20.270 --> 45:22.530]  Are we playing another 15 turn or what's going on?
[45:22.970 --> 45:24.070]  Yeah, let's run it back.
[45:24.850 --> 45:25.890]  To the hot air balloon!
[45:27.770 --> 45:28.570]  Let's go!
[45:30.670 --> 45:32.670]  And you spun the wheel and we landed on
[45:32.670 --> 45:33.970]  Wiggler's Treehouse or something.
[45:34.050 --> 45:34.950]  Yes, we did.
[45:35.750 --> 45:37.910]  When the wheel was spun, it was Wiggler's Treehouse.
[45:38.090 --> 45:40.650]  Which I think is the most basic.
[45:40.770 --> 45:41.410]  I've never played this one.
[45:42.150 --> 45:43.210]  It's up to the wheel, baby.
[45:44.330 --> 45:45.490]  We won't defy the wheel.
[45:45.670 --> 45:47.690]  I played this one with my wife the other day, it's cute.
[45:47.890 --> 45:49.370]  There's a caterpillar in the middle.
[45:50.850 --> 45:52.130]  Yeah, dude, that's Wiggler, bro.
[45:53.210 --> 45:54.150]  Were you practicing, Geoff?
[45:55.330 --> 45:56.490]  Nah, I was just playing.
[45:57.310 --> 45:58.890]  Shut up, you play with Meg all the time.
[45:59.170 --> 45:59.490]  That's true.
[45:59.490 --> 46:01.410]  15 turns, bonus stars on.
[46:01.650 --> 46:02.730]  Oh, this is it.
[46:02.790 --> 46:05.450]  I only played with Emily because you and Meg played together
[46:05.450 --> 46:06.870]  and I thought, maybe that's something we could do.
[46:07.450 --> 46:08.270]  How did it go?
[46:08.690 --> 46:09.090]  It was fun.
[46:09.950 --> 46:11.230]  Emily fell asleep playing.
[46:12.590 --> 46:15.390]  We were playing a game where we were against each other steering
[46:15.390 --> 46:17.470]  and I saw her veer into a wall
[46:17.470 --> 46:18.250]  and I went, what the fuck?
[46:18.310 --> 46:19.370]  And I looked over and she was down.
[46:20.270 --> 46:21.390]  It's like when you were playing Crackdown.
[46:21.830 --> 46:23.470]  Yeah, it was a lot like Crackdown.
[46:24.930 --> 46:26.970]  Westimus Prime, thanks for streaming on my birthday.
[46:26.970 --> 46:29.310]  So happy to have gotten a Gerpler and a shirt today.
[46:29.390 --> 46:30.570]  Hey, happy birthday, Westimus Prime.
[46:30.570 --> 46:33.310]  Hey, congratulations. Hey, by the way, the shirt's not sold out.
[46:33.730 --> 46:34.470]  No, the shirt's still there.
[46:34.690 --> 46:36.630]  Yeah, if you want to get a shirt, that's fucking...
[46:37.090 --> 46:39.690]  Guys, if you really want to stick it to us today,
[46:39.750 --> 46:40.410]  you want to grab a shirt.
[46:40.930 --> 46:41.830]  Yeah, that'll teach us.
[46:42.890 --> 46:45.110]  Did anyone get ballsy enough to put the shirt in
[46:45.110 --> 46:47.130]  with the Gerp and just hope that it wasn't gone?
[46:47.450 --> 46:49.150]  There were a bunch of people that did that.
[46:49.330 --> 46:50.970]  I think they put it in their cart
[46:51.730 --> 46:53.010]  before and then did that.
[46:53.270 --> 46:53.850]  Oh, that's smart.
[46:53.850 --> 46:56.290]  And then you get reamed less on the shipping.
[46:56.630 --> 46:57.310]  There you go.
[46:57.610 --> 46:58.710]  What can you do?
[46:58.790 --> 47:00.130]  Fuck, man. Fucking shipping.
[47:01.150 --> 47:02.530]  Dude, shipping. It sucks.
[47:02.770 --> 47:04.290]  It's just getting out of control.
[47:04.670 --> 47:05.150]  That's it.
[47:06.990 --> 47:08.990]  Everyone's napping. Honey treats.
[47:09.550 --> 47:10.910]  When I used to...
[47:10.910 --> 47:12.810]  When I started Rooster Teeth,
[47:12.850 --> 47:14.530]  and I was our shipping department,
[47:14.930 --> 47:18.170]  I could sell a t-shirt for...
[47:18.170 --> 47:20.190]  I could ship a t-shirt for like
[47:20.190 --> 47:21.310]  $2.75.
[47:21.310 --> 47:22.190]  Yeah.
[47:22.970 --> 47:23.590]  Dilkong!
[47:25.750 --> 47:26.370]  Dilkong!
[47:27.670 --> 47:28.510]  That's right!
[47:29.030 --> 47:30.870]  This is Dilkong's world!
[47:31.290 --> 47:32.910]  And I'm going third.
[47:33.870 --> 47:34.370]  Wow.
[47:36.850 --> 47:38.090]  Holy shit.
[47:40.250 --> 47:41.370]  Let's get Dilkong's
[47:41.370 --> 47:43.170]  in the chat. This is gonna be the round of Dilkong.
[47:43.310 --> 47:45.470]  Five star game. Five star game
[47:45.470 --> 47:46.470]  coming right now.
[47:48.010 --> 47:48.270]  Dilkong.
[47:48.270 --> 47:50.030]  That's a pretty small map. I think you can do five.
[47:50.330 --> 47:50.970]  I'm getting five.
[47:52.610 --> 47:54.310]  Everyone else is gonna get eight, so we're gonna
[47:54.310 --> 47:55.950]  ignore that, but I'm getting five.
[47:56.770 --> 47:58.350]  This is the first game we're playing today
[47:58.350 --> 48:00.370]  where I'm gonna remember what happened in the first half.
[48:00.710 --> 48:01.350]  Oh, that's good.
[48:02.630 --> 48:04.150]  That's great. Congratulations.
[48:04.410 --> 48:06.050]  Well, we'll see. We'll see how long Andrew's
[48:06.910 --> 48:08.470]  electricity lasts. Can I be honest?
[48:08.930 --> 48:09.290]  Yeah.
[48:10.470 --> 48:10.990]  It's fine.
[48:11.890 --> 48:12.930]  I don't wanna be too chaotic.
[48:14.230 --> 48:15.190]  How low is the battery?
[48:15.190 --> 48:17.440]  No, it was... I fixed it.
[48:17.950 --> 48:19.470]  Oh, come on!
[48:19.590 --> 48:21.870]  I don't wanna be too chaotic.
[48:21.890 --> 48:23.250]  We'll talk about it at the end
[48:23.250 --> 48:23.990]  of what happened.
[48:25.090 --> 48:27.130]  Did we just dodge Calamity
[48:27.130 --> 48:28.090]  somehow? Yes.
[48:29.390 --> 48:30.510]  Oh, God.
[48:31.130 --> 48:33.150]  The exact same bullshit.
[48:33.930 --> 48:34.610]  Four minutes.
[48:34.830 --> 48:36.010]  No, it's different bullshit.
[48:38.610 --> 48:40.990]  I would. Let's see what we got.
[48:40.990 --> 48:41.410]  Oh,
[48:43.090 --> 48:45.150]  two dice. Is that the first time
[48:45.150 --> 48:46.530]  we've hit a thousand GPM?
[48:47.870 --> 48:48.990]  A thousand grippers per minute?
[48:49.350 --> 48:49.490]  Yeah.
[48:50.270 --> 48:51.910]  It might be.
[48:52.310 --> 48:54.050]  I believe it might be.
[48:54.230 --> 48:55.710]  I think maybe call Guinness.
[49:01.230 --> 49:01.670]  They
[49:02.530 --> 49:03.770]  will take your call
[49:04.350 --> 49:06.470]  and then they'll be like, yeah, we'll come.
[49:07.030 --> 49:08.810]  We'll come do that. It's gonna be expensive.
[49:09.190 --> 49:10.750]  We looked into it. I pitched a show
[49:10.750 --> 49:12.850]  one time where Achievement Hunter...
[49:13.310 --> 49:14.850]  Achievement Hunter just broke Guinness
[49:14.850 --> 49:16.230]  records over and over again.
[49:16.310 --> 49:18.330]  Each week was a new Guinness record we tried to break.
[49:19.070 --> 49:19.850]  Obscure shit.
[49:22.130 --> 49:22.930]  Largest chips
[49:22.930 --> 49:23.650]  in queso.
[49:24.690 --> 49:26.510]  Swimming pool with queso and chips.
[49:27.610 --> 49:28.750]  That was one of the ones I used
[49:28.750 --> 49:29.150]  as a pitch.
[49:30.850 --> 49:32.470]  We got as far as
[49:33.170 --> 49:34.810]  working with Guinness and talking to them
[49:34.810 --> 49:36.490]  and they wanted to charge us like 10 grand
[49:36.490 --> 49:37.290]  an episode or something.
[49:38.090 --> 49:40.610]  You have to fly a person out.
[49:40.610 --> 49:42.470]  You have to do all this stuff.
[49:42.550 --> 49:44.870]  It's not just, hey, isn't this fun?
[49:45.250 --> 49:45.970]  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
[49:46.230 --> 49:48.290]  The alternate idea was, fuck Guinness.
[49:48.350 --> 49:49.970]  What if we start our own record book?
[49:50.750 --> 49:51.550]  Love it.
[49:52.210 --> 49:53.390]  Then that fell through as well.
[49:53.830 --> 49:54.630]  That would have been genius.
[49:56.530 --> 49:58.250]  It would have been so good
[49:58.250 --> 49:59.590]  because you would have called it Achievement Hunter
[49:59.590 --> 50:01.570]  and you could have gotten a real-life achievement.
[50:02.110 --> 50:03.330]  Yeah, it would have been amazing.
[50:08.310 --> 50:08.690]  Money mo!
[50:09.970 --> 50:10.690]  Money mo!
[50:11.510 --> 50:13.650]  So many what could have been's
[50:13.650 --> 50:14.670]  and almost were's
[50:14.670 --> 50:15.670]  in that career.
[50:15.970 --> 50:18.850]  That is the way it goes.
[50:21.720 --> 50:22.300]  Nice.
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.640]  For those who missed the Q4
[50:26.640 --> 50:28.620]  GURP, there will potentially be
[50:28.620 --> 50:30.980]  a Q1 GURP for you to buy.
[50:31.480 --> 50:32.900]  Yeah, there's definitely
[50:32.900 --> 50:34.780]  going to be a Q1
[50:34.780 --> 50:36.300]  GURP drop. We're currently
[50:36.300 --> 50:38.240]  in the process of trying to order
[50:38.240 --> 50:40.600]  5,000 more
[50:40.600 --> 50:42.220]  GURPlers, which is
[50:42.220 --> 50:44.680]  20% more than we ordered this
[50:44.680 --> 50:45.080]  time.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.720]  20% more than we'll sell.
[50:49.720 --> 50:50.760]  I hope
[50:50.760 --> 50:52.640]  so. I hope it's that versus the other.
[50:56.700 --> 50:57.460]  I'm ready.
[50:58.360 --> 50:58.820]  I'm ready.
[51:00.740 --> 51:01.400]  What am I doing?
[51:02.340 --> 51:03.240]  Way to go, man.
[51:04.200 --> 51:05.200]  You're picking a key.
[51:07.400 --> 51:08.540]  And then picking
[51:08.540 --> 51:10.440]  a door. And just pay attention to what was
[51:10.440 --> 51:11.080]  picked, I guess.
[51:16.740 --> 51:17.780]  Oh, Mario!
[51:18.900 --> 51:20.620]  I feel like going last
[51:20.620 --> 51:21.720]  is more helpful in this one.
[51:22.640 --> 51:24.380]  Or just nailing it on the first try.
[51:24.940 --> 51:25.460]  Yeah, or that.
[51:30.140 --> 51:30.660]  Loser!
[51:31.080 --> 51:32.160]  You idiot!
[51:33.080 --> 51:34.040]  Stupid idiot!
[51:34.260 --> 51:36.140]  You fucking suck.
[51:37.020 --> 51:37.540]  Alright.
[51:39.640 --> 51:40.140]  Do it.
[51:41.020 --> 51:41.360]  No!
[51:41.360 --> 51:42.940]  Yeah, there you go.
[51:43.000 --> 51:43.760]  Bye, losers!
[51:46.000 --> 51:46.960]  I'm just...
[51:48.060 --> 51:49.100]  Disappointed right now.
[51:49.340 --> 51:50.100]  Gonna do this bad boy.
[51:51.180 --> 51:52.520]  I swear to God, Geoff.
[51:52.860 --> 51:55.360]  No! If Geoff nails it on one...
[51:56.100 --> 51:56.420]  Nope.
[51:56.980 --> 51:58.680]  Alright. Still alive.
[52:03.200 --> 52:03.600]  How hard
[52:03.600 --> 52:05.320]  would it be to do a pre-order?
[52:05.440 --> 52:07.640]  Pre-orders are a pain in everyone's asshole.
[52:07.960 --> 52:09.580]  I'll just tell you right now, we're not doing
[52:09.580 --> 52:11.340]  pre-orders for anything.
[52:11.340 --> 52:13.620]  It has been a huge
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.700]  behind-the-scenes calamity
[52:15.700 --> 52:17.560]  every time we've done it
[52:17.560 --> 52:18.220]  at Rooster Teeth.
[52:19.020 --> 52:19.360]  No!
[52:21.380 --> 52:23.540]  There's actually a lot of regulations
[52:23.880 --> 52:25.300]  and reporting required
[52:25.300 --> 52:27.480]  if you take money from people and you don't
[52:27.480 --> 52:29.380]  give them the product within 30 days.
[52:29.820 --> 52:30.700]  It becomes a...
[52:31.160 --> 52:33.360]  kind of a management layer nightmare.
[52:34.200 --> 52:35.800]  And so...
[52:35.800 --> 52:37.680]  It is just...
[52:37.680 --> 52:39.480]  It's just not worth it.
[52:39.480 --> 52:40.460]  Damn it!
[52:40.900 --> 52:43.720]  I just don't
[52:43.720 --> 52:44.980]  feel comfortable taking
[52:45.540 --> 52:47.260]  thousands of dollars from customers
[52:47.260 --> 52:48.840]  and then not giving them a product.
[52:49.260 --> 52:51.540]  And then relying on a boat to come
[52:51.540 --> 52:53.080]  from China to America or whatever
[52:53.080 --> 52:55.580]  for money. You know, like, so many things can
[52:55.580 --> 52:57.160]  and do go wrong in the process.
[52:57.480 --> 52:59.300]  I don't want to have your money in my hand
[52:59.300 --> 52:59.960]  while it does.
[53:00.600 --> 53:03.120]  And especially when, like, potentially new tariffs
[53:03.120 --> 53:05.020]  and shit coming in while the money's in the air.
[53:05.040 --> 53:06.680]  Exactly! Somali pirates!
[53:06.680 --> 53:07.940]  Like, you have no idea.
[53:08.200 --> 53:10.920]  The more time between money leaving your hand
[53:10.920 --> 53:12.820]  and the product getting to you, there is
[53:12.820 --> 53:14.640]  the less happy you are.
[53:14.820 --> 53:17.060]  We just can't do it that way.
[53:17.160 --> 53:17.940]  It's just not gonna work.
[53:19.120 --> 53:20.320]  What the f...
[53:20.320 --> 53:22.860]  And also then we don't get to take
[53:22.860 --> 53:24.760]  these gambles on the amount of extra
[53:24.760 --> 53:25.820]  cups we'll end up with.
[53:27.020 --> 53:27.960]  Just got
[53:28.540 --> 53:30.780]  done. 5000 is the
[53:30.780 --> 53:31.140]  reorder.
[53:31.920 --> 53:34.660]  So, we are still targeting
[53:34.660 --> 53:36.540]  early February. We're waiting for confirmation
[53:36.540 --> 53:38.860]  on the date, but we are
[53:38.860 --> 53:40.500]  getting these ASAP.
[53:40.680 --> 53:41.920]  This is the soonest we can get them.
[53:42.840 --> 53:44.520]  Do you think if we'd gone
[53:44.520 --> 53:46.660]  5000 first, we would've
[53:46.660 --> 53:48.840]  got to 6 minutes or would we be at 5 minutes
[53:48.840 --> 53:50.900]  of buying? Probably, I think 5 minutes.
[53:51.820 --> 53:52.180]  Yeah.
[53:52.980 --> 53:54.860]  Our GPMs seem to be pretty steady there.
[53:59.400 --> 54:00.400]  1000 GPM.
[54:01.140 --> 54:01.540]  Hahaha.
[54:02.660 --> 54:04.560]  The February 5000, that's
[54:04.560 --> 54:06.260]  funny. Mooshig. Mooshk.
[54:09.140 --> 54:09.540]  Mooshk.
[54:11.500 --> 54:12.380]  Oh, get on that.
[54:12.460 --> 54:14.080]  Get on him, dude. Yeah, man.
[54:14.080 --> 54:15.120]  Ride that caterpillar.
[54:15.940 --> 54:18.360]  So, that pisses him off a little bit? Yeah, then he'll
[54:18.360 --> 54:20.260]  move now, I think. And it changes the board.
[54:20.880 --> 54:22.580]  Oh my god, those pancakes look so
[54:22.580 --> 54:24.300]  good. They do look good.
[54:24.320 --> 54:26.240]  Wow, they're perfect. Did you have pancakes for breakfast,
[54:26.400 --> 54:26.480]  Derek?
[54:28.060 --> 54:28.840]  No, my wife
[54:28.840 --> 54:30.220]  had a waffle. I had migas.
[54:30.480 --> 54:32.480]  I wasn't sure what to get. They were on the menu
[54:32.480 --> 54:34.360]  and I went, oh, that sounds good. They were
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.040]  so good.
[54:36.280 --> 54:37.400]  The migas are very good there.
[54:38.920 --> 54:39.600]  They're great.
[54:41.080 --> 54:41.880]  Didn't I have that?
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.360]  I don't remember. Maybe? I think so.
[54:46.820 --> 54:47.780]  What's the bow?
[54:48.840 --> 54:50.460]  I think migas is maybe
[54:50.460 --> 54:52.560]  the most complete breakfast
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.400]  food. Yeah, yeah.
[54:54.400 --> 54:56.400]  It's, uh...
[54:57.160 --> 54:58.460]  Okay, cool. I'm just gonna
[54:58.460 --> 55:00.620]  ban this guy. Oh, from my chat.
[55:00.760 --> 55:01.060]  We're good.
[55:02.560 --> 55:03.520]  The migas
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.100]  there are so good.
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.480]  I'd never had migas before I moved
[55:08.480 --> 55:09.540]  here. Oh, really?
[55:10.020 --> 55:12.420]  I guess it's not super...
[55:12.420 --> 55:14.400]  No, I'd never had them
[55:14.400 --> 55:15.580]  before. They are
[55:16.500 --> 55:17.460]  so good.
[55:17.960 --> 55:19.820]  Migas are such a great way
[55:20.380 --> 55:22.400]  to have them. I mean, I love it. I love
[55:22.400 --> 55:24.160]  migas. I make them at home all the time.
[55:24.260 --> 55:25.460]  They're so good there, though.
[55:26.420 --> 55:28.080]  He's got Geoff's red boots on.
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.160]  You mean Nick's red boots.
[55:32.000 --> 55:32.600]  Don't think
[55:32.600 --> 55:34.400]  we forgot. Nick, you still have to
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.580]  fulfill your punishment for coming in runner-up.
[55:37.060 --> 55:38.180]  Yeah. Oh, we talked
[55:38.180 --> 55:40.400]  about that the other day, I think with, like, Gracie.
[55:41.240 --> 55:42.320]  Oh, yeah. It's pretty cool.
[55:43.620 --> 55:44.260]  Did I just screw
[55:44.260 --> 55:46.420]  myself by moving the big bastard? You did.
[55:46.580 --> 55:47.600]  You did. Way to go, man.
[55:48.080 --> 55:50.320]  That's nice. I wanted that
[55:50.320 --> 55:52.220]  green space. I want it in my stats.
[55:53.280 --> 55:53.980]  What do I want?
[55:54.300 --> 55:55.440]  Flying Rhino Man.
[55:56.660 --> 55:58.100]  Just subscribe to the Prime Sub.
[55:58.180 --> 55:59.160]  Thank you, Flying Rhino Man.
[56:00.640 --> 56:01.520]  Thank you!
[56:03.400 --> 56:04.520]  Flying Rhino Man.
[56:05.360 --> 56:06.320]  That would be...
[56:06.800 --> 56:08.460]  Dude, here we go.
[56:08.720 --> 56:09.500]  Here's a great question.
[56:10.220 --> 56:12.380]  What animal that doesn't fly
[56:12.380 --> 56:14.320]  that if you saw it in the air flying
[56:14.320 --> 56:16.440]  at you would be the scariest? I think a rhino
[56:16.440 --> 56:17.880]  would be up there. Right. Rhinos
[56:17.880 --> 56:18.800]  would be up there, yeah.
[56:20.460 --> 56:21.420]  Ooh. Green space.
[56:21.620 --> 56:23.860]  If I saw a manatee flying at me
[56:23.860 --> 56:25.860]  I'd be weirded out, but I don't know how threatened
[56:25.860 --> 56:26.440]  I'd be.
[56:27.980 --> 56:29.200]  What about swordfish?
[56:29.660 --> 56:30.460]  Oh, god.
[56:31.160 --> 56:33.800]  Dude, anaconda is a
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.900]  good one. Imagine you're in a plane
[56:35.900 --> 56:37.720]  and you look at the window and an anaconda starts
[56:37.720 --> 56:40.020]  flapping up. Dude, I'm gonna tell you
[56:40.020 --> 56:41.900]  something right now. If
[56:41.900 --> 56:43.920]  I ever see that, I will
[56:43.920 --> 56:45.320]  find a way to commit suicide.
[56:46.740 --> 56:47.980]  If I have to
[56:48.700 --> 56:49.140]  No!
[56:50.840 --> 56:51.900]  Just do it.
[56:52.660 --> 56:53.660]  Stretch it out.
[56:54.340 --> 56:55.480]  I don't wanna live in that world.
[56:56.300 --> 56:58.360]  Although, if you catch it in your ass
[56:58.360 --> 56:59.340]  I think that's a hundred grand.
[57:01.920 --> 57:02.800]  Oh, shit!
[57:03.280 --> 57:04.220]  Jerk off again?
[57:05.140 --> 57:06.460]  Alright, you guys ready to crank hog?
[57:07.640 --> 57:08.500]  What's the technique?
[57:08.840 --> 57:09.960]  Nick, how do I do this fast?
[57:10.260 --> 57:11.660]  Nick, how do you do it?
[57:11.960 --> 57:14.360]  Gavin, stop
[57:14.360 --> 57:15.360]  being a gentle lover.
[57:15.760 --> 57:18.180]  I assume we lost because of me last time.
[57:18.320 --> 57:19.480]  So I was just seeing if you had any tips.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.400]  It seems like Nick was definitely carrying the team
[57:22.400 --> 57:23.000]  in style.
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.460]  Maybe I could put
[57:26.460 --> 57:27.480]  this in a paint shaker.
[57:27.960 --> 57:29.260]  Alright, hogs out. Let's go.
[57:29.460 --> 57:31.860]  They used to call Nick Popeye in college
[57:32.540 --> 57:33.800]  because of his forearms.
[57:33.800 --> 57:34.460]  Go!
[57:41.960 --> 57:44.020]  I'll be honest. I was looking at the other team
[57:44.020 --> 57:45.420]  and it looked like Andrew was doing it all the way.
[57:48.580 --> 57:49.780]  I don't know, dude. I was making
[57:49.780 --> 57:50.540]  most of the noise.
[57:53.200 --> 57:53.920]  My elbow!
[57:54.380 --> 57:54.580]  Ow!
[57:54.980 --> 57:56.640]  Yeah, it hurts. It hurts real bad.
[57:58.280 --> 57:58.640]  Ow.
[58:02.480 --> 58:02.840]  Wait.
[58:03.820 --> 58:04.540]  What?
[58:05.200 --> 58:05.920]  What?
[58:06.380 --> 58:07.100]  What?
[58:09.500 --> 58:10.900]  I felt like I got coins
[58:10.900 --> 58:11.340]  for that.
[58:12.580 --> 58:14.020]  What happened?
[58:14.660 --> 58:15.340]  Didn't you win?
[58:16.320 --> 58:17.160]  I thought we won.
[58:17.680 --> 58:18.040]  No.
[58:19.740 --> 58:21.680]  Why would you think that?
[58:22.600 --> 58:23.740]  Were you watching the game?
[58:24.260 --> 58:25.320]  I guess not.
[58:25.620 --> 58:27.320]  Did I win?
[58:28.240 --> 58:30.440]  I thought we lost!
[58:30.440 --> 58:31.760]  I thought we won!
[58:31.860 --> 58:32.800]  It looked like we won!
[58:32.900 --> 58:35.500]  It did not look like you won.
[58:35.580 --> 58:36.800]  It looked like you lost.
[58:37.080 --> 58:39.380]  I was screaming, oh shit, I suck.
[58:39.600 --> 58:40.220]  Right at the end.
[58:42.160 --> 58:43.740]  I thought I lost.
[58:44.320 --> 58:45.260]  And then Gavin was like,
[58:45.320 --> 58:47.360]  it looked like Andrew did all the work on your side.
[58:47.460 --> 58:48.460]  And I was like, shut up.
[58:50.000 --> 58:51.240]  I mean, I heard that bit.
[58:52.180 --> 58:53.540]  Must have blocked everything else out.
[58:53.880 --> 58:55.240]  We did lose, right, chat?
[58:55.360 --> 58:56.280]  Like, Nick and I lost?
[58:56.280 --> 58:56.800]  Yes.
[58:57.700 --> 59:00.280]  Yeah, I don't know what happened between you guys.
[59:00.480 --> 59:01.280]  No, yeah, you lost.
[59:01.280 --> 59:03.380]  That's so weird that Nick and I both thought.
[59:04.100 --> 59:04.320]  Yeah.
[59:05.460 --> 59:06.860]  Do you know which team you're on?
[59:07.440 --> 59:10.400]  Yeah, I think I mistook which hand was whose.
[59:10.940 --> 59:11.140]  Have you?
[59:11.220 --> 59:11.400]  Maybe.
[59:14.760 --> 59:15.840]  Two or more.
[59:16.040 --> 59:16.520]  Two or more.
[59:17.260 --> 59:17.660]  No!
[59:19.360 --> 59:21.840]  I fucking hate this game!
[59:21.840 --> 59:25.540]  Why did they make this?
[59:27.320 --> 59:28.620]  I'm officially too hot.
[59:28.660 --> 59:29.200]  I'm sweating.
[59:31.720 --> 59:33.440]  Fuck off!
[59:34.480 --> 59:35.880]  Smoke free!
[59:38.180 --> 59:39.960]  Who am I versing
[59:39.960 --> 59:41.400]  outside of the world?
[59:42.180 --> 59:43.940]  Me against the world!
[59:47.780 --> 59:48.740]  No!
[59:48.740 --> 59:50.720]  Whose coins are we gonna pull?
[59:51.300 --> 59:53.220]  Fucking Nick and his eight coins?
[59:53.840 --> 59:55.460]  Can't even buy a fucking
[59:55.460 --> 59:57.240]  happy meal with how much Nick has.
[59:57.660 --> 59:59.080]  How many are we putting in?
[59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.640]  You'll find out!
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.820]  Hit the goddamn box!
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.160]  He wouldn't need the happy meal if he had the McDonald's microwave, right?
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.440]  That's true.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.420]  Oh, wait, we all put shit in?
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:08.800]  Okay.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.700]  Nick and Geoff are bankrupt.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.000]  A quiz!
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.340]  Oh, Christ.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.480]  Oh, fuck me.
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.960]  I gotta pay attention.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.960]  How many ripples does Mario have in his mustache?
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.280]  How many times can you do
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.240]  the Jack-Off minigame?
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.820]  Oh, fuck.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.460]  Oh, it's this thing.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.060]  You have to look at this thing and go like,
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.700]  how many are these, or which one was this?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.640]  I suck at this at depression.
[01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.430]  Shut up.
[01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.210]  There's one on the left!
[01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:47.390]  There it is.
[01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:49.710]  I don't like this.
[01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.930]  This is how Nick makes the juice.
[01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:51.850]  Yeah.
[01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:57.190]  Okay.
[01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:58.930]  Easy.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.160]  Oh, fuck.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.680]  What are you doing?
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:07.880]  Is it time-based?
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.340]  Yeah, it is.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.620]  That's what screwed me last time on this.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.200]  I went to go click the guy,
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:16.380]  not the fucking dumb symbol at the bottom.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:20.840]  Okay.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:21.500]  Round two.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.120]  What do we got?
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:24.760]  What do we got?
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.000]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:26.640]  Yep.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.860]  Did you get that?
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:32.980]  You got that?
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:34.600]  Nope.
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.920]  Fuck me, dude. That one sucked.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.960]  You got it. Which one was the waving toad?
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:40.880]  What?
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.760]  Might as well just go with it.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.720]  Yeah, why not?
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.080]  Well, Gavin won this. Congratulations.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.600]  That's not over yet.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.260]  Still want two more rounds?
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.040]  Or is this one more round?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.060]  No, I think he mathematically can't lose.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.480]  Final round.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.060]  You're going to win, regardless.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.900]  Yeah, you can really fuck over Geoff here, Gavin.
[01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:12.710]  This one's nuts.
[01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:13.550]  Easy.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.480]  Oh, it's so hard.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.320]  Shit.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.160]  Fuck!
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:27.300]  No!
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.580]  It's a 50-50.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.080]  It's a 50-50.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.820]  I'll take the second amount of coins.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.780]  I didn't go with the crowd.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.720]  I don't think we- do we get anything?
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:41.660]  Oh, shit!
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:43.400]  Oh, no!
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.520]  What's up?
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.200]  Oh, no!
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:46.380]  Oh!
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.180]  Yeah, take me up those coins, baby!
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:49.840]  Oh, no!
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.860]  Geoff has zero everything.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.340]  Oh, I just got a communication error and got kicked.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.300]  Oh my god, he did it on purpose!
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.760]  No, I'm not on Wi-Fi!
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.960]  Shut up with that.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.620]  Alright, so shall I-
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.040]  Let's wait for Geoff, I guess.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.640]  So let's dip- why don't you quit out of this thing
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.840]  and then see if it'll load back in.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.200]  Okay, I'm gonna quit.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.200]  To hot air balloon.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:19.880]  Okay.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.840]  Start plane to exit, uh...
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.880]  Yep, there you go.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.100]  It's gonna say that Geoff is out
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.260]  next week, so we are heisting
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:33.680]  art.
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.960]  Also, got-
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.840]  there's a message here, Scoob Drew
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.980]  1 says, hey Gavin, what camera did you
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.840]  use to film that promo?
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.100]  Uh, I used
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:44.860]  my Phantom.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.600]  Very cool. Oh, you're back.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.800]  Cool, hell yeah. Alright, let's get back to it, boys.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.880]  I think I filmed it at
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.320]  500 frames a second.
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:55.200]  Wow. Damn. Not bad.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.800]  Yeah, if you wanted to, you could
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.700]  even do faster than that, right? Like, you could go to
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.900]  600 frames if you wanted to.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.780]  And I'm gonna cut
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.020]  a little behind-the-scenes
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.800]  clip for some tier that we haven't
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.560]  decided yet on Patreon. Yeah.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.340]  That's fun.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.520]  I really enjoy being alive.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.520]  That's great.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.120]  That's good.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.000]  It's fun. Different emotions are good,
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.440]  so it's good to feel that sometimes.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.600]  I like my job, I like my
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.820]  friends that I work with, I like making fun of
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:37.460]  you guys.
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.280]  Who the fuck is-
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.640]  Uh-oh. Did it just undo all that?
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.340]  Wait, did it?
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.620]  I don't know. I didn't see any of this shit.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:49.580]  Oh, I don't have all the coins I just won.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.480]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.900]  Wait, I get another chance at this?
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.220]  Oh, balls.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.640]  My win was for nothing.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.180]  And there's a bloke there.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.540]  The last bloke was Yoshi.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.940]  Oh, it's my turn.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.220]  Donkey Kong's turn. Let's use the double dice.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.140]  Yeah, we
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.260]  had the opportunity of Yoshi.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.060]  That's
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.120]  bullshit. Why didn't it save?
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.740]  HelloDumpster says,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.160]  is Geoff in the good times era? I think we
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.320]  are definitely in a good times era right now.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.780]  Seven. Five. Seven.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:23.720]  Seven.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.680]  God damn it!
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.100]  How is it worse?
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.740]  Except for maybe Andrew.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.560]  Piece of shit.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:35.720]  Wait.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.460]  What?
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.220]  How many
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.820]  different Gerplers did we make at the old company?
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.840]  We made the red one.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.880]  We made the purple one.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.400]  We made the Gerple one.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.220]  Was there a purple one?
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.260]  Was there a purple one?
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.280]  Yeah, we did green and purple.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.340]  Yeah, we did green and purple.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.680]  It was the thing where it was supposed to be a
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.740]  blind box, but they put them all in sequence
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.720]  so everyone either got green or
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.020]  purple.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.380]  Oh, that's right!
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:06.240]  That's the only thing I remember
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.560]  from that.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.800]  There was the golden Gerp as well.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.100]  So there were five different designs,
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.960]  but we really only sold four of them.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.640]  We might...
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.600]  I'd have to...
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.940]  There'd be no way to go back and look, but we might have
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.020]  just sold as many Gerplers in four
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.940]  minutes as we sold the entire time we were at Rooster Teeth.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.320]  Yeah, that might
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:26.720]  be true.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.960]  I love our new company.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.100]  It's pretty good. I'm having a good time.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.120]  What am I missing? I'm sorry.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.840]  Red, green,
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.860]  purple, gold, Gerple,
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:43.660]  and now black.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.560]  Who in the chat has all of the Gerps?
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.180]  Oh man, do you really want to out yourself like that, guys?
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.280]  I wish I did.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.040]  I think I only have the green ones.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.100]  Yeah, because the gold
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.100]  is...
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.360]  Yeah, I never got that.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.760]  That was such a funny idea
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.760]  to do that and then have a thumb drive
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.860]  where you outed yourself if you uploaded
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.300]  the video.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.060]  I think that was so funny.
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.320]  What was the video?
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.880]  Was us chugging sodas?
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.200]  It was trying not to burp.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.080]  It was chugging a Gerple full of soda
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.600]  and then trying not to burp.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.320]  Oh, Geoff, come on. We got this.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.380]  Oh, the dream team.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.140]  Oh, please don't jack us again.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.760]  Zero and one.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.940]  I love prime cut. I'm good at this.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:34.840]  Uh-oh.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.140]  I shouldn't have said that out loud.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.060]  Yeah, probably.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.160]  You just hit start. Just hit okay.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.220]  You know what this is.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.820]  I think halfway is like...
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.400]  Like that?
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:50.940]  Yeah, that's about it.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:52.720]  Yeah, I think that's it, guys. Good work.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:53.960]  Hey, you nailed it. Excellent.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.400]  Geoff wants to keep practicing.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.060]  He just likes cutting meat.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.680]  I do just like cutting meat.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.640]  Damn, it looks good.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.580]  It looks good.
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.440]  Angle a little...
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.520]  You think like that?
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:08.320]  There?
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.940]  Any adjustments on my end?
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.640]  I think you're good. Let's try this.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.620]  Oh, come on.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.820]  Yeah, I think...
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.380]  We'll see.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.740]  Let's just go with the angle.
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.900]  With the angle?
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.100]  Wow, interesting.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.220]  I think...
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.860]  Oh, that's pretty good, guys.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:29.760]  Wow.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.460]  Yeah, there we go.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.360]  Wow.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.960]  I think that may have been a mistake, but we're okay.
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:37.860]  Be straight.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.840]  Guys, wait right here.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.660]  You guys beating meat earlier, now you're cutting meat?
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.960]  I think that's pretty good.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:45.940]  Let's do this.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:47.060]  Yeah.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.100]  Okay.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.480]  Oh, I like that a lot.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.960]  It all comes down to this.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.400]  Let's see.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.180]  Fuck!
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.000]  Wow.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.180]  No!
[01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:01.680]  50-50!
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.180]  I keep looking at the wrong...
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:05.720]  Yeah!
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:07.520]  Finish.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.800]  That was close.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.240]  We tied again?
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.640]  How did we do that two times?
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.440]  I don't know.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.180]  That doesn't seem likely.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:18.380]  The game wants a tie.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.360]  I need to figure out where I am on this screen.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.360]  Because I keep thinking I'm the other team.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.460]  And going, oh, fuck!
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.940]  You're Donkey Kong!
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.640]  I know who I am!
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.060]  It's when they present at the thing.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:32.960]  Geoff!
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.320]  Let me go reboot my internet, I guess.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.120]  I don't know what else to do.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:38.500]  I'm sorry.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.680]  I don't know what else to do.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.900]  Do you think it's saved?
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:46.720]  No.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.960]  Do you think it'll save now?
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.640]  Geoff is like, oh, I didn't win.
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.420]  Oh, wow, it disconnected me again.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.140]  That's so crazy.
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.400]  That's so crazy.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.500]  We made it through the entire last game just fine.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.400]  You're going to drop out of Discord, too.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.060]  Well, also...
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.960]  Geoff did say it was the good times.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:06.000]  He did.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.640]  I feel like Geoff has been the most prone to errors recently.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.660]  I think he's just cursed.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:11.560]  Yeah.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.040]  Might be true.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.600]  Oh, it made you overwrite the other one?
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.860]  Well, if we finished it.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:17.740]  Oh, right.
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.640]  Whatever that other game that we completed and it's gone forever.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.160]  Why is it gone?
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.840]  It didn't end in the way it should have, so...
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.560]  Bring it back!
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:29.360]  Yeah.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.040]  We've got to go back!
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.140]  See, now we're on turn four.
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.560]  Why did real turn three not save?
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.320]  I don't know.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.520]  I don't know.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.420]  It wasn't full turn three when we did it the last time.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.520]  Oh, it was two people.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.180]  It was the versus.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.700]  It is only Nintendo.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.460]  I wonder if I should just get a new Switch.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.580]  Do you have an original?
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.380]  Or like an OLED?
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.580]  I have an original, I think.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.140]  Fuck you!
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.980]  Piece of fucking shit!
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.160]  God damn it.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:07.680]  I like that we saw the possibility of you getting a star.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.920]  God damn it.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.060]  And we stopped it before it became reality.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.800]  How far away from a new Nintendo console are we?
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.100]  A year?
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.900]  Yeah, I think at least.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.760]  I don't want to buy a Switch just for a year.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.100]  I'm not taking any chances.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:21.880]  Nah, you shouldn't.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.280]  They're fucking expensive still.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:27.220]  Jesus Christ.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.340]  That was eight turns for me getting that many spaces.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.260]  Switch 2 comes out in spring of 2025.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.540]  They're saying.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:39.740]  There you go.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.580]  Oh yeah!
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.040]  They might put it on the same boat.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.700]  It would be interesting to see if the tariffs
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.320]  potentially shift.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.160]  Oh god, I didn't even think about that.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360]  Oh, Andrew, it's wrong!
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.940]  Are you kidding me?
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:58.920]  Wow.
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:11:59.980]  Awesome.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.320]  Oh my god.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:01.600]  Oh.
[01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.380]  Oh.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:05.620]  Oh fuck.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.080]  Whoa.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:08.960]  Oh!
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.240]  Hey.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:13.400]  Fucking.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.200]  When Gavin stole your ship.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.460]  I'll remember that.
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:21.000]  He took the star.
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:21.840]  You got coins.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.240]  I was paying attention!
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.120]  This Kong getting dilled all day.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.160]  Yeah, he's just getting fucked.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:30.860]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:33.560]  I got enough for another one.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.300]  Do you guys want to place any bets
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.860]  on if I get disconnected again?
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.580]  And how long it'll be until it happens?
[01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.780]  We can over-under turns.
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:42.960]  Over-under, yeah.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.320]  This is turn 4, so you want to say
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.120]  3 and a half?
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.220]  Over-under 3, like 3 and a half
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:50.780]  more turns.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.040]  So it'd be somewhere between 7 and 8?
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.020]  Yeah, so it would be
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.200]  7 and under and then 8 and over.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.880]  What do you think? You want the over-under, Geoff?
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180]  I'm gonna take the over.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:02.840]  I'm optimistic.
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.960]  Stars in front of me, stars behind me.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.480]  Fucking Nick Deagoland
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.500]  like a piece of shit.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.300]  Go dip your nose
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.420]  in hot sauce again.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.860]  Hey, nobody knows about that.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.660]  Oh, good job.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.420]  Now let's see it
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:26.700]  get closer behind me.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.580]  Oh nice, finally it's away.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.720]  It's way back, okay.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.040]  Oh, I got a pro strat.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.200]  Please hit A.
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.720]  I've hit A.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:40.840]  Not you.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.860]  Who needs to hit A?
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.760]  Gavin. Oh, it wasn't me.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.440]  Oh, you did the logo at the same time, I thought it was you.
[01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:52.130]  Gavin.
[01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.350]  What are you doing?
[01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:55.550]  Gavin, are you here?
[01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.390]  I'm back.
[01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.070]  Gavin!
[01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.730]  Gavin!
[01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:02.570]  I mean, I never left the desk.
[01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:03.890]  I was just talking.
[01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.230]  Then why weren't you just hitting the button?
[01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:08.270]  I couldn't see.
[01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:13.530]  I don't know, Gavin.
[01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:15.310]  I don't know how you think you're in the right here.
[01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.970]  I had a short, I had a 15 second
[01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:19.310]  real life interaction.
[01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:20.710]  You just hit the button.
[01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:22.210]  It's me?
[01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:25.890]  You're putting 2,000 people on hold.
[01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:26.730]  It's true.
[01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:28.270]  It was the under.
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.210]  Unbelievable.
[01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:33.930]  Guys, I think that has to be it.
[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.930]  I think we might be done.
[01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.210]  I think this might be it.
[01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:37.950]  It's just not working.
[01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:42.770]  I really don't know what the problem is.
[01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:43.650]  It's not my internet.
[01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:46.370]  It's fine.
[01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.910]  I'm not getting disconnected anywhere.
[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:49.890]  I'm on WiFi on my Mac
[01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:50.690]  and it's fine.
[01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.150]  I'm not getting disconnected.
[01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:56.390]  Any suggestions?
[01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:57.710]  I got a star and everything.
[01:14:58.330 --> 01:14:59.690]  Did we lose all that?
[01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:01.370]  Probably.
[01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.450]  You didn't get to a game, right?
[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:04.530]  That's true.
[01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:06.670]  He's back in.
[01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:08.230]  One more time.
[01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:10.270]  Let's see where we are.
[01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:14.510]  I think he's back in
[01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.270]  because you did quit.
[01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:17.150]  Maybe that's why.
[01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:17.810]  Yeah.
[01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:21.810]  My star!
[01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:26.350]  What did you roll?
[01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:27.310]  Two spaces?
[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:28.250]  You'll be fine.
[01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:31.610]  That's a roll of five.
[01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.070]  Can I check that I'm not connected with WiFi?
[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:34.770]  Yes, I checked.
[01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:38.230]  We're still on the original!
[01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:42.570]  There were two stars acquired in that turn.
[01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:44.270]  Oh, hell yeah!
[01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:46.850]  I'm directly connected to my router.
[01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.510]  I think turn four
[01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:51.790]  might be our new episode 16.
[01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:52.850]  This is pretty exciting.
[01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:54.510]  The chat was stuck in a time loop.
[01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:55.530]  Come on!
[01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:59.810]  You cannot fucking do this to me!
[01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.930]  No!
[01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:02.010]  No!
[01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:04.730]  It's the worst of both worlds!
[01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:07.090]  This is what happened in the original turn.
[01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:08.830]  The original timeline!
[01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:10.450]  We're back on the old timeline.
[01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.590]  Why? Just let me get the star!
[01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:17.010]  Just let me take it!
[01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:19.410]  Yeah, somebody asked if my Switch is updated.
[01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:21.030]  I did update my Switch this morning.
[01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:23.350]  I don't think you can play if it's not today.
[01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:24.330]  I agree, yes.
[01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:27.670]  First thing I did this morning when I got up early
[01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.550]  is make sure everything was set up properly.
[01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:31.770]  Pickaxe dash?
[01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:33.670]  Bring an advantage
[01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:35.290]  because I landed on it at least.
[01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:36.050]  I need it.
[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.150]  Oh, god damn it.
[01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.750]  Oh, this is going to be another fucking jerk-off game.
[01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:43.330]  Yup!
[01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:46.990]  Let's jerk this tunnel!
[01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.710]  Time to jerk this tunnel, guys.
[01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:49.570]  Alright.
[01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:52.690]  I gotta save my stamina.
[01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.750]  Yeah, I'm not wasting any of this.
[01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:57.510]  I need to wrap my elbow or something.
[01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.870]  Here goes.
[01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:04.590]  Ooh, Gavin with the late start.
[01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:06.010]  Damn it! Damn it!
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:07.830]  Come on, me! Come on!
[01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.970]  Get out of there!
[01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.890]  What? What?
[01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:11.650]  Oh, fuck!
[01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:17.590]  Y'all don't even jerk
[01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:19.290]  in the same league
[01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:20.250]  as this guy.
[01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:23.190]  I got 49 years of ripping my dick off.
[01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:25.910]  Geoff does it
[01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:28.710]  overhand, opposite hand.
[01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.510]  So it's all fucked up.
[01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:33.630]  He's got techniques you've never even heard of.
[01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.290]  This is suddenly going to be the turn 4
[01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.010]  that takes.
[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:38.690]  Geoff will not drop out again all of a sudden.
[01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.990]  Yeah, well, isn't that gonna be crazy how that's gonna work?
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.950]  Nope.
[01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.730]  All I know is that it's
[01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:45.490]  set up properly.
[01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:47.350]  On my end.
[01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.030]  Yes! You skipped your item!
[01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:52.550]  I don't have enough money.
[01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.190]  Oh.
[01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:56.890]  I hope that you get
[01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:58.290]  eaten by bees or some shit.
[01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.650]  I don't know.
[01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.930]  Nick is thinking.
[01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:04.470]  What's in that one?
[01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:05.950]  Bees!
[01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:06.630]  Oh no, it's bees.
[01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:09.670]  You better disconnect again.
[01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:10.030]  Not the bees!
[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:13.590]  What happened?
[01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.910]  What happened?
[01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.550]  He got the bees.
[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:17.850]  What does that mean?
[01:18:18.330 --> 01:18:20.590]  He's got the bees.
[01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.890]  Yeah, he's got all those bees.
[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:25.490]  Everybody telling me I have to disconnect from my WiFi
[01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:27.510]  before I use Ethernet, I am aware of that.
[01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.110]  Thank you. You can stop saying that.
[01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:30.670]  What about those bees?
[01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:31.030]  Bees.
[01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:36.210]  I missed the old timeline.
[01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:42.610]  Yeah, we got a bunch of people saying
[01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:44.550]  they're getting their orders shipped right now for the Gerplers
[01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.190]  they bought today.
[01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:49.110]  Keep an eye on your email, you should get a notification.
[01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:50.630]  They should all be shipped out
[01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:51.870]  by Monday.
[01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:53.590]  The end of Monday.
[01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.510]  Man, I got a shitload of shit.
[01:18:58.190 --> 01:18:58.590]  Dang.
[01:18:58.970 --> 01:18:59.190]  Wow.
[01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:00.950]  Yeah, the vast majority
[01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:03.850]  of people bought one.
[01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.030]  In the grand scheme of things,
[01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:07.290]  very few people bought more than one.
[01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.450]  That's very respectful.
[01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:10.250]  Yeah, I think people were being very respectful.
[01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:13.550]  So we'll have another 5,000 in February
[01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:15.670]  is what it looks like.
[01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.710]  So we will let you know when they arrive
[01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:19.590]  and we'll have dates and everything for you.
[01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:20.930]  As soon as we get them.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:25.780]  Oh!
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.600]  We're getting another chance at the bees?
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.500]  Did you get bees?
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.580]  How much honey
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:32.220]  are you going to get, Geoff?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.840]  Geoff is thinking. I'm going to get this much.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.600]  Yeah, the ones in February
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.580]  the ones we're getting restocked are the same color.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.180]  Yeah, they'll be identical.
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.720]  Oh, two things.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.600]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.820]  That felt like about 11 honeys.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.360]  Oh, you can try again?
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.940]  Are you free?
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:53.900]  Oh my god.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.020]  Bees!
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.100]  Close enough?
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.040]  Minigame.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.000]  Minigame.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.720]  I'm surprised Geoff didn't disconnect when he got the bees.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.220]  Honestly.
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.120]  If I make it through this minigame, that means we banked this level.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.240]  Let's lock in.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:13.340]  It's us, son.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.580]  Oh, produce?
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.000]  Gavin trying to get it straight this time.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.200]  He's on the other team.
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.560]  Yeah, what team do you think you're on, dude?
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.960]  It's me and you, Geoff.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.240]  Okay, bananas, melons.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.480]  Be careful over there, Andrew. Gavin gets real confused real fast.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.340]  I bet he does.
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.120]  That's not where the melon goes.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.740]  I love that Dilkong's on the nanas. That makes so much sense.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:34.240]  Yeah.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.200]  Alright, boys, let's start it up.
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.220]  Alright, now for real.
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.060]  For real, for real.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.220]  Let's do this.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:44.540]  Like Brutus.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:44.920]  Alright, Geoff.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:46.560]  You're good.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.400]  Thank you, son.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.120]  Nice.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.300]  They're working hard. Things are happening.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.580]  Okay, got melon coming down the pipe.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:20:59.140]  You got a melon coming your way.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.120]  Oh, I see it, baby. Don't you worry about that.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:01.900]  Melon coming down the pipe.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:03.500]  Wow.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:05.940]  Melon coming down the pipe.
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.240]  Look at him move.
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:13.140]  Gavin, put it back!
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.900]  Drop the melon.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:16.200]  17H!
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:19.460]  It's a tie!
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.080]  Did Gavin blow it again?
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.320]  He's like, I got a nana for you.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.520]  And he put it two feet in front of the conveyor belt.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:27.420]  Now, somebody asked
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.280]  if I replaced that backlight fluid
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.080]  in my switch yet. I haven't checked that out.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.540]  I will consider that.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.120]  I'm sorry, Andrew.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.740]  Oh, Gavin. That's okay.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.220]  We did really good.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:41.760]  I set you up for failure.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.960]  No, we did really good.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:45.420]  I'm glad it counted the one I accidentally took off, though.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:47.460]  Finally.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.260]  Rightfully get this star.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.300]  Which was always mine.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.300]  It'd be funny if Bowser
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:54.760]  popped up.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.420]  Those Koopas throw some hammers at me and rob me
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.480]  to steal the star.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.700]  You get a star!
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.260]  Dilkon!
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.120]  In the lead.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:11.640]  Okay.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.540]  Guess who's closest to it.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.400]  Fuckin' Annie.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.280]  You got like a million fuckin' things you could use.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:21.780]  Sure.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:22.920]  What can I get?
[01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:32.510]  What is that thing?
[01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.150]  Give me that.
[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:35.650]  Is that a whistle?
[01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.670]  What?
[01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:40.870]  Move to a star? Oh my god.
[01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:44.330]  Does it move you to it?
[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:45.610]  Or does it move it away?
[01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:48.590]  It just moves the star itself.
[01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.270]  Oh.
[01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:52.370]  Sorry, Geoff.
[01:22:52.810 --> 01:22:54.310]  I get it. I have the most money.
[01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:56.830]  My fault for being successful.
[01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:58.990]  It's all that honey money.
[01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.950]  I want some of it.
[01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:02.330]  He's got mad honey money.
[01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:08.970]  Oh, you still have one coin.
[01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.690]  One honey coin.
[01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.430]  One sweet, sweet honey coin.
[01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.450]  His big thumbs up.
[01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.730]  That's a Dil approved
[01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:23.830]  thumbs up right there.
[01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:30.530]  Nobody needs to buy
[01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:32.070]  a black market Gerpler
[01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:34.010]  that's being sold for an upcharge.
[01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:35.810]  Wait for fuckin'
[01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:38.190]  60 days and we'll
[01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:40.290]  sell you one ourselves.
[01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:42.370]  Yeah, it's not...
[01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:43.970]  If you don't get one today,
[01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:45.490]  it doesn't mean you're never gonna get one.
[01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:47.150]  We're gonna make them until we die.
[01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:50.010]  As long as you keep wanting to buy them. Don't worry, you will get one.
[01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:52.510]  I did see someone say that they were 0 for 4
[01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.770]  on getting Gerbster.
[01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:55.870]  I'm so sorry about that and I want to make sure
[01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:57.710]  that you're 1 for 5. I really do.
[01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:59.910]  We're gonna spend thousands of dollars
[01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:00.970]  to make sure you get one.
[01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.830]  And hey, 1 for 5 in the MLB,
[01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:07.590]  it's borderline that you get...
[01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:09.810]  You're bottom of the rotation, but you're still playing
[01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:11.570]  Batman 8. Yeah, you're good.
[01:24:11.970 --> 01:24:13.870]  Honestly, you do that and you're Will Smith
[01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:14.850]  and you win a World Series.
[01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:17.990]  We talked about it in a recent
[01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:19.530]  episode we recorded that hasn't come out yet,
[01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:21.930]  but our eventual goal is that there's
[01:24:21.930 --> 01:24:22.930]  always one stock.
[01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:25.790]  Yeah, we're trying to keep stock and get
[01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:27.670]  the stuff. We also don't know how many we need
[01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:28.710]  and what we need to do that.
[01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:31.690]  Because we're 5
[01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:33.190]  people working with a company.
[01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:35.470]  The company doesn't know how many we need
[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.790]  or what we need to do that. And that's it.
[01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:41.450]  So an experience like the...
[01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:43.470]  As we've said multiple times, like the fact
[01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:45.390]  the site didn't crash, everything logistically
[01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:47.770]  is amazing. Now we have more
[01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:49.570]  data to use moving forward.
[01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:51.690]  Yeah, and I mean we had to kind of...
[01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:53.730]  I know it sounds dumb because it's just a cup, but we had to
[01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:55.390]  start over from 0
[01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:57.670]  and uh...
[01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:58.750]  Oh, that's why. Yeah.
[01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:01.650]  Oh. Oh my god.
[01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:03.470]  Which meant like we had to go through I think
[01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:05.370]  4 iterations of the Gerpler
[01:25:05.370 --> 01:25:07.170]  before we were able to get one that
[01:25:07.170 --> 01:25:08.350]  looked right, you know?
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.230]  We had a lot of work that we had
[01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:12.730]  already been done that we had to redo
[01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:13.830]  with the new company.
[01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.070]  Yeah. You're still in?
[01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:19.290]  I'm re-entering it. I'm trying to.
[01:25:19.570 --> 01:25:21.170]  Oh. Okay. Okay. Well in that case...
[01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.710]  Okay.
[01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:26.910]  That's fucked up.
[01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:29.030]  When you get back,
[01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.430]  you might be missing some stuff.
[01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:33.350]  Oh, he also can't defend himself.
[01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:35.170]  He can't fight him. That's why it's fucked up.
[01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:36.710]  No, the AI is still like
[01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:39.610]  defending for you. That's one less than what Andrew gave up.
[01:25:41.490 --> 01:25:43.010]  He got 4 more?
[01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:44.170]  5 more? I got 10.
[01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:45.590]  Oh man.
[01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:48.810]  I can't believe this horse shit.
[01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.010]  Well, this turn might not be real if Geoff can't get in.
[01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:52.950]  It's true. Yep.
[01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:55.050]  Well, you gotta get it anyway.
[01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:56.630]  Go ahead. Well, I don't wanna...
[01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:59.010]  I don't want it to go into Geoff's turn though.
[01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:00.650]  Well, then what are we doing?
[01:26:00.810 --> 01:26:01.430]  What are we doing here?
[01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.350]  We're seeing if Geoff can get back in.
[01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:05.670]  He's never been able to get back in in this way.
[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:07.550]  You're gonna have to leave and then he'll show up.
[01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:08.510]  Do we know that for sure?
[01:26:08.770 --> 01:26:10.650]  Well, that's the way it's worked every other time.
[01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:14.210]  Geoff, are you able to get in right now?
[01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:15.650]  I'm still...
[01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:16.730]  I'm still working on it.
[01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:19.050]  Cause last time we didn't go all the way back.
[01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:20.390]  We just went back to halfway.
[01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.630]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:23.730]  So have we done that?
[01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:27.630]  Yeah, I'm just waiting 30 seconds, Andrew.
[01:26:27.730 --> 01:26:28.770]  No, but it's never worked.
[01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:30.970]  I'm saying we've done this 8 times, it's never worked.
[01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:32.210]  So you want me to leave now?
[01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:34.730]  I just think that we're gonna have to ultimately.
[01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:36.210]  I just don't know what you're waiting for.
[01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.270]  I think you should buy this star.
[01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:40.450]  Interesting that the one who has a locked in star suggests we leave.
[01:26:42.190 --> 01:26:43.890]  I've already lost a star in this process.
[01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:44.890]  Not you, him!
[01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:45.450]  Oh.
[01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.370]  Technically, I've lost a star in this process too.
[01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:50.710]  I'm backing you, dammit!
[01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:55.730]  Geoff's been disconnected.
[01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.570]  So he almost got in.
[01:26:57.630 --> 01:26:58.410]  Sorry, Nick.
[01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:01.390]  It's okay, I was just trying to help you, Gavin.
[01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:07.730]  Also, this is not a problem with Xbox or PC.
[01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:09.730]  It's only this piece of shit fucking Nintendo.
[01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:10.870]  Like, we've...
[01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:11.290]  SnowRunner.
[01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:15.850]  SnowRunner has been a problem my entire life.
[01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.890]  And with different internet.
[01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:19.190]  TombstoneTally, you kept dropping out.
[01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.750]  Oh.
[01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:23.050]  We did have an issue with TombstoneTally.
[01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:25.390]  Look at this prick get all the stars.
[01:27:26.770 --> 01:27:28.750]  For how long is the question?
[01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:30.950]  They're texting together.
[01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:33.270]  He's like, when Andrew doesn't have to go his way,
[01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:34.350]  he's making Geoff drop.
[01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:37.670]  Geoff and I are like, cheating at a casino.
[01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.230]  We got like, gestures at a cross table
[01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:41.630]  and we're gesturing back and forth.
[01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:43.250]  It's counting cards,
[01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:44.870]  but it's just counting moves and then he just drops.
[01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:47.210]  How do I drop away from...
[01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:49.170]  Check my nat? Do I log into my modem?
[01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:49.890]  To do that?
[01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:52.330]  You'd probably check on the switch itself.
[01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:54.310]  By doing like a...
[01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:55.010]  online test.
[01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:56.330]  We got the same things in the shop?
[01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:59.870]  I think next time you disconnect,
[01:28:00.090 --> 01:28:01.190]  I'm gonna suggest something crazy.
[01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:02.750]  I'm gonna suggest going on wifi.
[01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:04.330]  I can do that.
[01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:07.110]  Did Kendrick Lamar just drop an album?
[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.770]  I don't know.
[01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.790]  I'm deep in the Mario Party.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.540]  Oh my god.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.560]  Yeah, but he's only selling 4,000.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.040]  There's gonna be a restock in February though.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.840]  I'll replace a pipe with a pipe.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.080]  Get this shit pipe out of here.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.440]  Oh, Nick, another chance. Honey Redemption.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:33.820]  Redemption!
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.260]  Here we go.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:41.380]  And...
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.640]  He will not land on...
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:43.720]  He doesn't want that. Wow.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.480]  Hey, good news.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.380]  Can confirm. Huge.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.060]  Battery going up.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.120]  Yeah?
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.460]  Yeah, it will not die.
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.000]  Battery is charging.
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.340]  Oh, Geoff, did you miss
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.140]  the stuff that happened with Andrew earlier?
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.840]  I don't know, what's that?
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.620]  He explained what he did.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.600]  I needed to get a proper AC adapter
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.040]  because it wouldn't display correctly
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.640]  so I played handheld last round
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.560]  and I uber-eatsed a power adapter
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.840]  from Walmart while we were playing last game.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.240]  Now I'm all good. Now it's charging.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:15.960]  It's working fine too.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.360]  Maybe I should uber-eats a fucking new...
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:23.360]  Just put WiFi into the...
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.920]  I checked my NAT on the Xbox
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.660]  the other day and it was moderate.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.200]  Sorry, Geoff.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.520]  Geoff, fight it off!
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.640]  You gotta shake the thing or hit buttons or something.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:36.220]  Let it lick you a few times.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.480]  Get him away from him!
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:39.900]  Nine...
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:41.700]  What?!
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.660]  Also, when I had issues in that
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.080]  SnowRunner game, I was still on WiFi.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.660]  I wasn't wired yet.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:53.460]  I don't think we bought the cable yet.
[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.420]  That is true.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.400]  Oh yeah, that might have been the last thing before.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.620]  That might have been why I got the cable.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:02.020]  Man, I'm never gonna roll a 21 again.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360]  He's about to roll a 22.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:05.920]  Give me that 22!
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.840]  No. Roll low.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.160]  Low, low, low, low, low, low.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.600]  That's pretty good.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.280]  Low, 22.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.220]  Very much in play.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:16.840]  Oh!
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:17.800]  Wow!
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.580]  Even better!
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.200]  What's up, Nick?
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:23.660]  What's up, son?
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:25.320]  I'm having a good time.
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.340]  You could pay Geoff to disconnect right now.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.220]  Oh, you don't have to pay me.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:31.840]  I'll do it soon.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.480]  Yank that shit out, Geoff.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:36.760]  I'm four short.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:37.420]  Damn it.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.780]  What? Oh, you're four short?
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:42.060]  You son of a bitch.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.340]  You son of a bitch.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.320]  Wow, you're a monster.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.060]  Well, you know, there's a star on the field.
[01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:51.610]  I don't have the most money.
[01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:52.490]  What are you doing?
[01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:54.410]  I'm not gonna steal all your money.
[01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:55.850]  I'm just stealing like 10, aren't I?
[01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:58.090]  Alright, I'm out. You guys can't play with me.
[01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.250]  No!
[01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:02.230]  You guys play without me. I don't know what to do.
[01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:05.270]  I'll sit and commentate, but I'm just ruining the day.
[01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:07.610]  Why don't we just wrap and then we could
[01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:09.550]  come back for this another time like we did last time.
[01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:11.490]  I agree. I think that's the way to do it.
[01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:12.410]  I think this is it.
[01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:15.450]  This was good because we finished the other game.
[01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:17.750]  But yeah, man, I think it's just...
[01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.010]  I think it's just an issue.
[01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:22.170]  No fucking problems for five rounds with the other game.
[01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.030]  Oh my god.
[01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:26.090]  Crazy, crazy, crazy.
[01:31:26.730 --> 01:31:29.890]  Well, thanks for watching, guys.
[01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:31.830]  We really appreciate
[01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:32.970]  everyone who came through
[01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:35.150]  and supported us today.
[01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:37.650]  The Gurplers sold out.
[01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:39.590]  Really appreciate everyone
[01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:41.790]  who bought one. We have a reorder
[01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:43.190]  restock going right now.
[01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:45.510]  It will be the same price. It is the same Gurpler.
[01:31:45.670 --> 01:31:47.410]  It will be here...
[01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:48.950]  We're looking at early February,
[01:31:49.450 --> 01:31:51.250]  so we'll have more information for you
[01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:53.230]  as we get it.
[01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:55.690]  In the meantime, you can check out the Patreon.
[01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:57.970]  Patreon.com slash the RegulationPod.
[01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:00.030]  Watch some gaming videos
[01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:01.750]  on Regulation Gameplay on YouTube
[01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:03.730]  and check out the podcast, Regulation Podcast.
[01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:05.930]  Guys, any final thoughts
[01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:07.350]  before we wrap it up here?
[01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:09.830]  Just thanks so much for the Gurpler support.
[01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:11.170]  It was absolutely nuts.
[01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:12.310]  4 minutes is nuts.
[01:32:12.930 --> 01:32:15.710]  I don't know what the fuck is going on
[01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:17.470]  with my Switch, but I will try
[01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:18.150]  to figure it out.
[01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:20.650]  Still, no one will have a star.
[01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:25.490]  I'm never going to roll another 25.
[01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:26.690]  It's true.
[01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:28.930]  Thank you very much. See you later. Bye!
[01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.850]  Bye!
