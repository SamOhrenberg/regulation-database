[00:00.000 --> 00:03.380]  Should we celebrate by torturing each other in Mario Party?
[00:03.900 --> 00:04.340]  Absolutely.
[00:04.980 --> 00:06.360]  Should we do Volcano level?
[00:06.540 --> 00:08.880]  We could maybe play the first time for this and then someone gets dropped.
[00:13.390 --> 00:15.310]  Hey, we stayed connected that whole time.
[00:15.570 --> 00:16.150]  That's pretty good.
[00:17.330 --> 00:19.810]  Waiting for another player to set up their controller.
[00:20.190 --> 00:21.710]  I wonder who that could be.
[00:21.950 --> 00:22.350]  It's Geoff.
[00:23.010 --> 00:23.790]  I'm watching it happen.
[00:24.030 --> 00:24.950]  I'm hitting the buttons.
[00:25.570 --> 00:26.130]  Oh, no.
[00:26.390 --> 00:27.790]  One controller is not supported.
[00:29.530 --> 00:30.550]  Everyone's wired in, right?
[00:31.050 --> 00:31.450]  Yep.
[00:32.710 --> 00:34.350]  Waiting for another to set up their controller.
[00:35.190 --> 00:37.770]  Unable to start the game because the controller wasn't ready.
[00:37.990 --> 00:38.410]  Geoff, thoughts?
[00:38.890 --> 00:40.070]  Do you want to start the game?
[00:40.150 --> 00:40.930]  Oh, well, I want to play.
[00:42.610 --> 00:43.950]  Well, I'm in a blimp now.
[00:44.670 --> 00:45.510]  Yeah, what happened?
[00:46.190 --> 00:48.010]  Oh, you all got kicked back.
[00:48.770 --> 00:49.890]  It went without Geoff.
[00:50.270 --> 00:50.970]  Well, that's weird.
[00:52.550 --> 00:54.010]  Wait, wait, did it work?
[00:54.690 --> 00:55.410]  No. No.
[00:55.950 --> 00:56.310]  OK.
[00:57.850 --> 00:59.350]  I wonder what's going on there, huh?
[00:59.350 --> 01:00.350]  Oh, Geoff.
[01:02.230 --> 01:03.710]  Strange, strange, strange.
[01:04.070 --> 01:07.070]  Are you playing on one tiny controller or two tiny controllers, Geoff?
[01:07.090 --> 01:08.270]  I have two tiny controllers.
[01:08.590 --> 01:08.690]  OK.
[01:09.590 --> 01:10.810]  Well, you just need one, though.
[01:11.230 --> 01:13.530]  Oh, OK. Well, I'll just play with one tiny controller.
[01:14.050 --> 01:15.370]  Yeah, I...
[01:17.770 --> 01:21.850]  Do you think I should use the purple one or the orange one?
[01:21.850 --> 01:23.910]  I think you should just use whichever one works, my man.
[01:24.270 --> 01:25.370]  Well, they both work.
[01:26.130 --> 01:27.710]  If you say so, sure.
[01:27.950 --> 01:29.270]  I think the orange one's cuter.
[01:29.270 --> 01:30.070]  I'm going to use that.
[01:30.390 --> 01:31.370]  OK. OK.
[01:31.490 --> 01:32.450]  Let's play together, huh?
[01:32.890 --> 01:34.030]  Yeah, that'd be nice.
[01:34.870 --> 01:35.530]  I'd love it.
[01:35.690 --> 01:36.690]  Let me turn these back on.
[01:38.410 --> 01:39.930]  OK, you did it.
[01:40.230 --> 01:41.570]  OK. All right.
[01:41.910 --> 01:43.070]  One Joy-Con to play.
[01:43.310 --> 01:44.050]  Oh, everyone's ready.
[01:44.250 --> 01:44.890]  There we go.
[01:45.770 --> 01:46.690]  Hell yeah.
[01:47.090 --> 01:47.350]  Woo!
[01:50.550 --> 01:51.030]  Unbelievable.
[01:52.650 --> 01:55.210]  I'm so happy so many people got the GURPS.
[01:55.550 --> 01:55.990]  I agree.
[01:56.290 --> 01:57.550]  That was plenty of time, too.
[01:57.550 --> 01:59.810]  Like, you had, like, 10 full minutes.
[02:00.070 --> 02:01.610]  Like, we told you exactly when it was going on sale.
[02:01.750 --> 02:04.390]  And man, you almost had 10 full minutes to go buy that.
[02:04.390 --> 02:07.590]  Well, I assume a lot of people must have put them in carts minute one.
[02:07.750 --> 02:08.510]  And it was just a queue.
[02:08.870 --> 02:09.070]  Yep.
[02:09.950 --> 02:10.570]  Let's see.
[02:11.030 --> 02:13.870]  OK, so you can... and you can still go over to RegulationsStore.com
[02:13.870 --> 02:16.870]  and get the Protected by Falcon sign, the Superior sign, the number one sign in the world.
[02:16.990 --> 02:17.670]  Thank you so much.
[02:18.950 --> 02:21.790]  Did anyone put a GURP in the cart at like 12.05
[02:21.790 --> 02:25.410]  or five past the hour and still get the GURP?
[02:25.410 --> 02:26.230]  That's an interesting question.
[02:26.230 --> 02:27.630]  Oh, that's a really good question.
[02:28.070 --> 02:30.310]  Oh, well, that's a good question.
[02:31.330 --> 02:33.950]  Aw, for God's sake!
[02:33.950 --> 02:34.370]  Oh, my God.
[02:34.590 --> 02:34.770]  I'm third.
[02:35.090 --> 02:35.890]  Hockey mole.
[02:36.670 --> 02:36.790]  OK.
[02:38.290 --> 02:38.770]  Yes.
[02:38.930 --> 02:39.370]  Get your mole.
[02:39.510 --> 02:39.730]  That's great.
[02:40.030 --> 02:42.350]  They got it at five after and got it.
[02:42.770 --> 02:43.290]  Hell yeah, dude.
[02:44.070 --> 02:44.250]  Yep.
[02:44.370 --> 02:44.910]  Give me my 10 coins.
[02:45.870 --> 02:47.630]  Give me my... what was my name?
[02:48.890 --> 02:49.210]  Andrew.
[02:49.490 --> 02:49.970]  Andrew.
[02:50.110 --> 02:50.770]  The Kong thing?
[02:51.550 --> 02:52.290]  Oh, Dilkong.
[02:52.750 --> 02:53.230]  Dilkong.
[02:53.250 --> 02:53.670]  Dilkong, thank you.
[02:54.650 --> 02:56.030]  Return of Dilkong.
[02:56.030 --> 02:57.350]  You gotta tap into Dil.
[02:59.590 --> 03:02.250]  Now, we're going to want to buy that star for 20 coins.
[03:02.350 --> 03:02.670]  Don't forget.
[03:03.530 --> 03:04.590]  Hold on to your coins.
[03:05.910 --> 03:06.610]  I'm holding on.
[03:08.710 --> 03:10.290]  Also, everybody hold on to your internet.
[03:10.450 --> 03:12.210]  We don't want anybody dropping like last time.
[03:12.650 --> 03:15.130]  Who are you talking to in this situation?
[03:15.370 --> 03:17.210]  I'm talking to everybody who could drop here.
[03:18.290 --> 03:20.430]  I think we all know it could happen to any of us.
[03:20.690 --> 03:22.770]  Yeah, at any time, for any reason.
[03:22.890 --> 03:23.250]  That's right.
[03:24.510 --> 03:25.590]  Oh, you got a clover!
[03:25.590 --> 03:27.010]  Bit of luck.
[03:31.810 --> 03:34.410]  Warp to an opponent's base.
[03:35.270 --> 03:35.790]  That's mine.
[03:37.030 --> 03:37.830]  Okay.
[03:38.390 --> 03:38.830]  Okay.
[03:40.130 --> 03:41.290]  It's Wario time?
[03:41.790 --> 03:42.290]  Yeah, dude.
[03:45.110 --> 03:48.710]  Oh, Nick is lucky.
[03:49.250 --> 03:49.810]  Oh, that's Gavin.
[03:50.070 --> 03:51.390]  Gavin is lucky.
[03:51.870 --> 03:53.070]  Gavin, you're so lucky.
[03:53.790 --> 03:54.630]  Oh, shit.
[03:54.630 --> 03:55.970]  I landed on red.
[03:56.730 --> 03:57.590]  Gavin's lucky.
[04:00.250 --> 04:01.110]  Son of a bitch.
[04:01.150 --> 04:02.670]  Even if I win the minigame, I can't get the star.
[04:08.470 --> 04:09.390]  Oh, yeah.
[04:10.730 --> 04:11.850]  Dilkong with a big hit.
[04:12.930 --> 04:13.910]  Big eights for Dil.
[04:14.810 --> 04:15.270]  Dang.
[04:16.410 --> 04:17.930]  Five, four, three.
[04:18.650 --> 04:22.510]  I'm seeing people in the subreddit who are posting like what they got and everything.
[04:22.510 --> 04:30.530]  And it's, we got people, Heatlifer, they got the Gerpler, the No Scrumping sign, and the Protected by Falcons sign.
[04:31.310 --> 04:34.990]  That's the triple dipper right there.
[04:35.310 --> 04:41.250]  I think they might be in another country because they said getting up at 3 a.m. to get my first pieces of merch was worth it.
[04:42.470 --> 04:50.410]  Maybe they just wanted to have their entire day done and so they could devote their time to the Gerpler sale.
[04:50.410 --> 04:54.390]  So they did all their work and all their chores and everything at 3 a.m.
[04:54.910 --> 04:55.210]  Yep.
[04:57.190 --> 04:57.910]  Man, shit.
[04:58.130 --> 04:58.330]  Wow.
[04:59.650 --> 05:00.790]  What are they setting up?
[05:00.990 --> 05:01.750]  With the 3v1?
[05:02.490 --> 05:04.010]  Yeah, right, like Australia? I have no idea.
[05:04.390 --> 05:05.190]  Those are both places.
[05:05.990 --> 05:06.490]  Are they?
[05:07.010 --> 05:07.930]  It remains to be seen.
[05:09.010 --> 05:09.370]  Minigame.
[05:10.890 --> 05:11.470]  Here we go.
[05:11.470 --> 05:12.250]  Let's do a minigame.
[05:12.470 --> 05:15.890]  All right. Guys, it looks like we're ending on level 19 of the hype train.
[05:18.430 --> 05:19.850]  Thank you so much for the hype train.
[05:19.850 --> 05:20.710]  Yeah, thank y'all.
[05:21.070 --> 05:21.330]  Bruiser.
[05:23.530 --> 05:25.530]  Bruiser? Have we done this one? I don't think we have.
[05:27.170 --> 05:27.970]  Oh, yeah, we have.
[05:28.130 --> 05:28.770]  Oh, yes, we have.
[05:28.770 --> 05:29.190]  Big time.
[05:29.650 --> 05:31.090]  Oh, I get to, like, smash you up.
[05:31.510 --> 05:31.810]  No.
[05:32.590 --> 05:34.030]  Oh, there's no jump.
[05:34.030 --> 05:34.250]  You ain't get me.
[05:37.590 --> 05:38.290]  You ain't get me.
[05:38.490 --> 05:39.190]  You ain't get Dukong.
[05:39.350 --> 05:40.530]  You think you're gonna get Dukong?
[05:40.730 --> 05:41.510]  You ain't get Dukong.
[05:42.210 --> 05:43.010]  Look at these moves.
[05:43.490 --> 05:44.750]  I got a mole on my back.
[05:46.790 --> 05:46.970]  Oh!
[05:47.870 --> 05:48.810]  Not anymore, you know.
[05:49.850 --> 05:51.310]  Ha ha ha ha.
[05:53.950 --> 05:54.810]  Go time.
[05:55.550 --> 05:55.790]  Robodog.
[05:56.010 --> 05:57.230]  Go for the ape.
[05:57.690 --> 05:59.070]  He's the biggest and easiest to hit.
[05:59.210 --> 05:59.590]  Robodog.
[06:00.910 --> 06:01.390]  Robodog.
[06:03.150 --> 06:04.310]  Oh, I'm slipping.
[06:04.590 --> 06:05.690]  I'm slipping off the button.
[06:05.710 --> 06:07.250]  My finger's slipping off the button.
[06:07.810 --> 06:08.590]  Come here, Dukong.
[06:08.950 --> 06:09.870]  Come here, boss.
[06:11.290 --> 06:12.590]  Go, Dukong, go.
[06:12.710 --> 06:13.030]  Escape.
[06:13.650 --> 06:14.130]  Escape.
[06:14.210 --> 06:14.890]  You can't get Dukong.
[06:15.930 --> 06:16.810]  You can't get Dukong.
[06:17.570 --> 06:17.970]  Hold the line, Dukong.
[06:17.970 --> 06:18.410]  Hold the line.
[06:18.590 --> 06:19.730]  I see you, Dukong.
[06:19.730 --> 06:20.790]  You can't get Dil.
[06:21.210 --> 06:22.270]  You can't get Dil.
[06:22.470 --> 06:23.490]  Hold the line.
[06:24.110 --> 06:24.250]  No!
[06:28.830 --> 06:30.370]  Gavin, you just played with us.
[06:30.670 --> 06:30.930]  What?
[06:31.690 --> 06:32.030]  Oh.
[06:32.390 --> 06:33.530]  That was just two seconds.
[06:36.450 --> 06:39.070]  Oh, and he's the only one that's getting coins, you son of a bitch.
[06:39.370 --> 06:40.990]  He doesn't have enough to buy the card, though.
[06:41.110 --> 06:42.350]  I'm gonna start with the star, because I suck.
[06:42.430 --> 06:43.090]  It landed on red.
[06:43.370 --> 06:43.630]  Yep.
[06:45.110 --> 06:48.890]  I, uh, did I tell you guys I invented a new game I want to play with you on the podcast?
[06:48.890 --> 06:51.930]  I'm really excited about, but I'm having a little bit of trouble filming right now.
[06:52.010 --> 06:52.550]  Oh, what is it?
[06:52.690 --> 06:55.170]  It's called Fart or Something Else.
[06:55.390 --> 06:55.810]  Oh.
[06:56.170 --> 06:58.090]  I don't like this game at all.
[06:58.370 --> 06:59.550]  I'm pretty sure you've pitched this.
[07:01.330 --> 07:03.610]  I'm pretty sure you've pitched this and we all said no.
[07:04.130 --> 07:06.730]  It's, uh, well, don't worry, it's an active development.
[07:07.570 --> 07:10.510]  Yeah, I think you might have already pitched Piss or Something Else.
[07:11.010 --> 07:13.270]  It's, uh, it's been greenlit.
[07:13.630 --> 07:15.310]  We're going forward with the full pilot.
[07:15.310 --> 07:17.950]  We didn't have our quarterly greenlight meeting.
[07:17.950 --> 07:19.170]  What are you talking about?
[07:22.510 --> 07:24.750]  Man, our friends are fucking stupid sometimes.
[07:26.610 --> 07:27.270]  Oh, no!
[07:28.090 --> 07:31.670]  We're stupid all the time, but some of our friends are fucking real dumb sometimes.
[07:33.150 --> 07:35.830]  Oh, I muffed it.
[07:36.710 --> 07:37.630]  Yeah, you blew it, dude.
[07:38.770 --> 07:39.990]  I might as well go shopping then.
[07:40.430 --> 07:42.750]  You might as well get a muff glove so you can clean it up.
[07:43.110 --> 07:43.850]  I'll get a muff glove.
[07:44.450 --> 07:46.490]  I don't like the way you guys keep...
[07:46.490 --> 07:47.650]  That's how I feel about the muff glove.
[07:51.490 --> 07:53.030]  Slide it in.
[07:56.490 --> 07:57.770]  By the way, the, uh...
[07:57.770 --> 07:58.270]  Oh, no!
[08:01.030 --> 08:02.630]  That's what I was saying, oh, no.
[08:04.070 --> 08:08.930]  By the way, the e-mote, the heart, regulation heart e-mote, awesome.
[08:08.930 --> 08:11.270]  Yes! We have a gerbil times e-mote.
[08:11.910 --> 08:13.290]  I think that's great.
[08:13.730 --> 08:14.790]  It's so cool.
[08:15.990 --> 08:16.830]  It's a little hard.
[08:17.250 --> 08:18.110]  Who made that?
[08:18.610 --> 08:22.130]  Someone in our community, I'm blanking their name at the moment, but thank you so much.
[08:22.570 --> 08:23.190]  It's really cool.
[08:26.090 --> 08:26.830]  Regulation hearts.
[08:29.210 --> 08:30.530]  It's a gerbil time miracle.
[08:30.910 --> 08:33.210]  I'm an idiot, I meant... God damn it, okay.
[08:33.670 --> 08:34.290]  What'd you meant to do?
[08:35.830 --> 08:37.490]  Oh! Oh, come on!
[08:37.790 --> 08:38.490]  Oh, come on!
[08:39.070 --> 08:40.750]  Things are turning for the dill!
[08:40.850 --> 08:41.890]  You gotta be kidding me.
[08:41.890 --> 08:42.970]  The dill gone!
[08:43.370 --> 08:44.750]  This is some bullshit!
[08:45.450 --> 08:48.830]  Oh, I went on a beach, I found some coins.
[08:50.210 --> 08:51.330]  Yeah, tell him, Nick.
[08:51.570 --> 08:51.930]  Roll high!
[08:54.110 --> 08:56.630]  Yeah, please be enough to miss the star.
[08:58.030 --> 08:58.850]  Not far enough.
[09:03.270 --> 09:04.450]  Find something on the beach!
[09:04.450 --> 09:04.490]  Find something on the beach!
[09:10.510 --> 09:12.410]  Alright, everybody fuck up the monkey.
[09:14.350 --> 09:15.650]  Done and done.
[09:15.990 --> 09:16.890]  Oh, it's me and Geoff.
[09:17.190 --> 09:19.230]  Oh, damn it, I'm on the monkey's team!
[09:19.510 --> 09:20.410]  What do I do?
[09:22.230 --> 09:24.130]  It's me and my best friend, the racist mustache.
[09:26.610 --> 09:28.670]  Oh, is this like stomping on the fuse one?
[09:31.370 --> 09:32.630]  We're good with this.
[09:32.630 --> 09:36.330]  Alright, remember when it crosses, you can stomp two at once.
[09:36.910 --> 09:38.490]  Yeah, that's the best way to do it.
[09:38.550 --> 09:39.210]  You're not doing it, though.
[09:40.930 --> 09:43.950]  I'm not doing it because I'm readied up.
[09:44.350 --> 09:45.630]  I don't need to do the practice.
[09:46.390 --> 09:49.230]  Alright, let's remember that Geoff doesn't need to do the practice.
[09:49.450 --> 09:49.930]  Here we go.
[09:50.670 --> 09:52.790]  Alright, I'll get the right side.
[09:53.030 --> 09:53.750]  Alright, I'll get the left side.
[09:54.590 --> 09:55.250]  TOUCH BUSH!
[09:55.410 --> 09:55.970]  TOUCH BUSH!
[09:56.070 --> 09:56.690]  TOUCH BUSH!
[09:56.690 --> 09:57.450]  TOUCH BUSH!
[09:57.650 --> 09:58.230]  TOUCH BUSH!
[09:58.450 --> 09:58.990]  TOUCH BUSH!
[10:00.470 --> 10:04.430]  Oh, it's going! It's going, Andrew!
[10:04.930 --> 10:07.030]  I'll get this one, Andrew. You get that one.
[10:08.130 --> 10:08.330]  Oh, no!
[10:09.490 --> 10:10.770]  Oh, my god!
[10:11.530 --> 10:12.190]  Oh, no!
[10:12.590 --> 10:13.330]  It's going south!
[10:13.810 --> 10:17.490]  I gotta go to the next one.
[10:18.650 --> 10:19.210]  The middle!
[10:19.830 --> 10:20.170]  No!
[10:20.670 --> 10:22.730]  Oh, no!
[10:23.590 --> 10:24.550]  Geoff, get that one!
[10:25.030 --> 10:25.450]  No!
[10:26.230 --> 10:26.650]  No!
[10:29.270 --> 10:31.250]  We failed spectacularly!
[10:31.710 --> 10:33.150]  All part of my plan.
[10:34.870 --> 10:35.290]  Wow.
[10:35.730 --> 10:37.150]  Gavin, you're out of control there, buddy.
[10:37.230 --> 10:38.950]  You need to keep it together, man.
[10:39.050 --> 10:40.850]  I saw you miss one, so I came to help out.
[10:40.850 --> 10:42.730]  You went and knocked me out of the way.
[10:43.090 --> 10:45.110]  Look, my ass was... it wanted to help.
[10:47.810 --> 10:49.510]  Hey, listen, I appreciate that.
[10:50.810 --> 10:52.670]  It's nothing less than an unhurtful anus.
[10:52.670 --> 10:54.650]  Yeah, you should never turn down a helpful ass.
[10:54.930 --> 10:56.630]  Oh, high tide.
[10:57.530 --> 10:58.790]  Uh-oh, what? No!
[10:59.130 --> 10:59.450]  No!
[11:00.030 --> 11:01.510]  Oh, that's awesome.
[11:01.710 --> 11:04.710]  No! The star!
[11:05.770 --> 11:06.830]  Oh, balls!
[11:11.050 --> 11:11.590]  No!
[11:12.750 --> 11:14.450]  This is one of the bullshits!
[11:14.450 --> 11:16.410]  I was the only one that had enough coins!
[11:16.930 --> 11:19.450]  So I can just stay there until I get the star?
[11:19.630 --> 11:20.510]  Shut up!
[11:21.430 --> 11:22.270]  Go to hell!
[11:22.370 --> 11:23.010]  Eat shit!
[11:24.310 --> 11:25.710]  Go to hell, you shit.
[11:26.350 --> 11:27.550]  No, he said eat shit.
[11:27.830 --> 11:30.170]  Well, I said go to hell, you shit.
[11:30.510 --> 11:31.650]  Uh-oh.
[11:33.210 --> 11:33.750]  Hey, what's up, buddy?
[11:34.790 --> 11:35.690]  I love fishing.
[11:37.210 --> 11:37.930]  Oh, okay.
[11:38.770 --> 11:39.210]  Oh.
[11:41.710 --> 11:43.270]  Oh, just fishing again.
[11:43.510 --> 11:45.050]  This is like fishing greed.
[11:47.210 --> 11:48.690]  Oh, you don't even get to do anything.
[11:48.690 --> 11:49.470]  That's great.
[11:49.990 --> 11:52.990]  Uh, yeah.
[11:53.250 --> 11:53.870]  Why wouldn't I?
[11:54.550 --> 11:56.310]  Well, I think you can overfill the bucket.
[11:56.470 --> 11:57.050]  Yeah.
[11:57.810 --> 11:59.970]  I'm not concerned about that.
[12:00.690 --> 12:01.770]  That's so okay.
[12:03.390 --> 12:04.870]  You're like playing blackjack
[12:04.870 --> 12:06.450]  and only have six across four cards.
[12:06.590 --> 12:07.570]  Hit. Hit again.
[12:09.690 --> 12:10.770]  There you go.
[12:11.310 --> 12:11.890]  Wow.
[12:14.450 --> 12:15.310]  Go again.
[12:15.750 --> 12:16.510]  I think I'm done.
[12:18.350 --> 12:19.390]  Probably swap.
[12:20.030 --> 12:20.170]  Yeah.
[12:21.330 --> 12:23.010]  And that's how to fish.
[12:24.210 --> 12:25.050]  You've been playing too much
[12:25.050 --> 12:25.810]  web fishing, dude.
[12:26.970 --> 12:27.490]  I've...
[12:28.630 --> 12:31.130]  Even when it feels like this game is finally
[12:31.130 --> 12:32.450]  turned against Gavin...
[12:32.450 --> 12:34.530]  Yes! Yes! Yes!
[12:34.690 --> 12:35.370]  There's still hope.
[12:36.010 --> 12:37.130]  Oh, damn. Do I have to go on this?
[12:38.170 --> 12:39.350]  Please send him away.
[12:39.870 --> 12:40.390]  Yes!
[12:42.910 --> 12:43.590]  Send him!
[12:43.590 --> 12:44.430]  Send him!
[12:44.870 --> 12:45.210]  Yes!
[12:45.730 --> 12:49.790]  I love how Nick is so competitive in, like, this game
[12:49.790 --> 12:51.170]  specifically. It's fantastic.
[12:51.410 --> 12:52.830]  And it costed money!
[12:53.330 --> 12:55.170]  I'm coming up for the star money!
[12:55.630 --> 12:56.030]  No!
[12:57.870 --> 12:58.910]  It sucks!
[13:00.410 --> 13:02.550]  Oh, I take back everything I said!
[13:02.690 --> 13:03.650]  This game is great!
[13:03.850 --> 13:05.330]  This game's fantastic!
[13:05.470 --> 13:07.210]  It robbed me and sent me away!
[13:11.430 --> 13:13.150]  Son of a bitch!
[13:13.450 --> 13:14.870]  It was just me and the star
[13:14.870 --> 13:15.870]  on my own island!
[13:17.210 --> 13:18.170]  Oh, Jesus.
[13:18.730 --> 13:19.730]  God help us.
[13:23.690 --> 13:25.370]  What are you... Come on. Today.
[13:25.470 --> 13:26.330]  Put it down!
[13:26.910 --> 13:27.670]  I'm thinking about it.
[13:27.710 --> 13:29.450]  He's thinking about where to place it.
[13:29.890 --> 13:32.350]  It only took a minute. Relax.
[13:33.290 --> 13:34.130]  For those joining late,
[13:34.430 --> 13:35.150]  be patient.
[13:35.150 --> 13:37.850]  A minute, Andrew? That's 600 to 700 Gerplers.
[13:39.590 --> 13:41.530]  We saw 5,000 Gerplers
[13:41.530 --> 13:43.510]  in about 9 minutes, I believe.
[13:43.870 --> 13:44.690]  For those who missed it.
[13:47.650 --> 13:48.770]  How many...
[13:48.770 --> 13:49.910]  Hell yeah!
[13:50.310 --> 13:52.030]  He just did that.
[14:00.610 --> 14:01.170]  And...
[14:01.170 --> 14:04.210]  I think we might actually have a few Falcon Suns left.
[14:04.210 --> 14:06.070]  Yeah, we do. There's still...
[14:06.070 --> 14:11.090]  I mean, it's the better one, but...
[14:11.090 --> 14:12.250]  That's the crazy thing.
[14:12.390 --> 14:14.510]  That's like the value of the day.
[14:14.810 --> 14:15.790]  You can still get it.
[14:16.710 --> 14:16.950]  Yep.
[14:17.930 --> 14:18.750]  Nice, dude.
[14:19.990 --> 14:21.410]  Solid six right there.
[14:24.610 --> 14:27.270]  Man, to have a 555 GPM
[14:27.270 --> 14:29.150]  after a 1,000 GPM...
[14:29.150 --> 14:29.590]  Nuts.
[14:30.650 --> 14:31.610]  Absolutely insane.
[14:31.610 --> 14:33.010]  The community is crazy.
[14:33.710 --> 14:34.970]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[14:37.250 --> 14:38.050]  I also
[14:38.850 --> 14:40.110]  reached out to
[14:41.010 --> 14:41.410]  our...
[14:41.810 --> 14:43.270]  to Alpha Muscle and let them know
[14:43.270 --> 14:46.270]  that we'll be in contact soon about what we want to do next.
[14:46.390 --> 14:47.850]  We have to think about it.
[14:48.350 --> 14:48.750]  Okay.
[14:49.950 --> 14:50.630]  Thanks, everybody.
[14:51.870 --> 14:52.790]  Thank you so much.
[14:54.650 --> 14:55.690]  Swim right into the shark.
[14:55.870 --> 14:58.370]  I think that's what you're supposed to do, is swim into the shark.
[14:58.750 --> 15:00.110]  No, just trying to figure out the actual
[15:00.110 --> 15:02.170]  controls for it. You gotta find the ass goblin and you gotta
[15:02.170 --> 15:03.130]  swim right into him.
[15:03.450 --> 15:04.770]  Find the ass goblin.
[15:08.110 --> 15:08.510]  Ow.
[15:09.710 --> 15:11.410]  Oh, you have to take it up to the...
[15:11.410 --> 15:11.810]  Yes, son.
[15:14.290 --> 15:14.690]  God.
[15:16.190 --> 15:18.350]  No, Monty Mole, you piece of shit!
[15:18.870 --> 15:20.290]  I'll take it away from you, no problem.
[15:22.130 --> 15:23.670]  Ah, this fucking... Geoff sucks.
[15:23.690 --> 15:25.870]  This fucking guy. That's what you get, Geoff.
[15:26.730 --> 15:27.650]  Not what I get.
[15:27.650 --> 15:29.630]  Not what I get.
[15:30.050 --> 15:33.390]  No, Blooper, you son of a...
[15:33.390 --> 15:35.790]  It's only five, though. You better take that from the monkey.
[15:36.550 --> 15:37.530]  You ain't getting it from Dill.
[15:38.050 --> 15:39.250]  You ain't getting nothing from Dill.
[15:39.970 --> 15:41.030]  This is Dill's.
[15:41.430 --> 15:42.730]  This is Dill's!
[15:42.990 --> 15:43.990]  This is Dill's!
[15:46.270 --> 15:47.850]  Geoff stole it!
[15:48.010 --> 15:49.410]  Dill will not forget, Mole!
[15:51.370 --> 15:53.070]  Dill will not forget!
[15:54.390 --> 15:55.550]  Uncompromising heist.
[16:02.790 --> 16:05.070]  That was awesome!
[16:05.650 --> 16:06.430]  Dill remembers!
[16:08.370 --> 16:09.650]  Dill hated that.
[16:12.970 --> 16:14.010]  Get Dilled.
[16:16.630 --> 16:18.310]  When does the tide recede?
[16:19.390 --> 16:21.190]  I think every three turns it goes up and down.
[16:21.490 --> 16:23.430]  It has something to do with the moon.
[16:24.310 --> 16:24.850]  Oh.
[16:28.170 --> 16:30.170]  Eric's got a moon quiz coming up.
[16:30.430 --> 16:32.250]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[16:32.490 --> 16:34.310]  I forgot about that the other day.
[16:38.330 --> 16:40.310]  Gotta find that text chain.
[16:41.590 --> 16:44.110]  The most insane text chain I'm on
[16:44.110 --> 16:46.390]  is me, Gavin, and my wife.
[16:49.370 --> 16:51.750]  And it started with my wife
[16:51.750 --> 16:52.890]  texting Gavin saying,
[16:53.110 --> 16:54.310]  I know the moon.
[16:55.630 --> 16:56.070]  What?
[16:58.370 --> 16:59.250]  I said,
[16:59.370 --> 17:01.250]  if you were a werewolf
[17:01.250 --> 17:03.510]  and you were on a space station,
[17:04.190 --> 17:06.010]  me and my wife were just talking
[17:06.010 --> 17:06.890]  and I brought that up.
[17:06.990 --> 17:08.150]  What would that mean for you?
[17:09.710 --> 17:11.550]  The moon's just out there, man.
[17:12.550 --> 17:14.210]  Then we got into a fight
[17:14.210 --> 17:15.290]  and then...
[17:16.470 --> 17:18.390]  I bet Gavin knows about the moon.
[17:18.710 --> 17:20.030]  And then Gavin said
[17:20.030 --> 17:20.950]  there will be a moon quiz.
[17:22.270 --> 17:23.690]  I'm gonna come up with a moon quiz.
[17:23.870 --> 17:25.090]  Next time we all meet,
[17:25.530 --> 17:27.290]  Barbara vs. Eric, moon quiz,
[17:27.410 --> 17:28.770]  $20 to the winner.
[17:29.050 --> 17:31.350]  And I just said, waning gibbous, waxing crescent.
[17:31.950 --> 17:32.450]  This is great.
[17:33.530 --> 17:34.490]  Dropping moon lingo.
[17:34.870 --> 17:35.490]  That could be in there.
[17:35.830 --> 17:39.790]  Is that high? Is that low?
[17:40.250 --> 17:41.350]  The main argument was that
[17:41.350 --> 17:43.650]  if you were on a space station,
[17:44.550 --> 17:45.850]  would you always be a werewolf?
[17:46.170 --> 17:46.390]  Right.
[17:46.790 --> 17:48.690]  It would be the same on a space station,
[17:48.690 --> 17:51.070]  orbiting the Earth, as it is on the Earth.
[17:51.690 --> 17:53.030]  I feel like you probably see the moon
[17:53.030 --> 17:53.910]  a little bit more.
[17:54.590 --> 17:57.150]  It would still be the same time on the moon.
[17:57.690 --> 17:59.290]  Would you be a more powerful werewolf?
[17:59.870 --> 18:00.830]  But if you were on a
[18:00.830 --> 18:02.910]  space station orbiting the moon,
[18:03.170 --> 18:04.810]  you would be flipping on and off.
[18:05.030 --> 18:07.250]  Constant werewolf 24-7.
[18:07.590 --> 18:07.770]  Yeah.
[18:10.050 --> 18:10.810]  This is cool.
[18:10.990 --> 18:12.290]  And again, you can look at the chat
[18:12.290 --> 18:14.450]  and note that people don't understand
[18:14.450 --> 18:16.290]  when we say Barbara who we're talking about.
[18:18.310 --> 18:19.270]  Barbara Smallwife.
[18:19.550 --> 18:20.570]  That rocks.
[18:22.170 --> 18:22.650]  Okay.
[18:25.110 --> 18:26.650]  Oh, the person that made the emote,
[18:26.790 --> 18:27.710]  their name is Donut Cool.
[18:28.450 --> 18:30.650]  Oh, cool. They did a great job.
[18:30.990 --> 18:32.810]  It's like my favorite emote right now.
[18:32.950 --> 18:33.370]  I think it's awesome.
[18:36.770 --> 18:36.950]  Yeah.
[18:39.410 --> 18:39.890]  Okay.
[18:40.590 --> 18:42.970]  Alright, you get $8,000, right?
[18:43.190 --> 18:43.450]  Okay.
[18:44.390 --> 18:45.670]  But every time
[18:45.670 --> 18:47.430]  you write cum, you have to
[18:47.430 --> 18:49.630]  spell it with a silent B at the end.
[18:49.630 --> 18:50.050]  Okay.
[18:52.070 --> 18:53.610]  I think that's
[18:54.110 --> 18:54.550]  awesome.
[18:55.670 --> 18:57.570]  Dude, for $8,000 also,
[18:57.750 --> 18:58.450]  that rocks.
[18:58.810 --> 19:01.350]  It's for the rest of your life and you just get $8,000 up front.
[19:01.450 --> 19:03.830]  Look at the chat. Look at what you did.
[19:07.250 --> 19:09.030]  There's a lot of cum in the chat.
[19:09.030 --> 19:09.770]  Cumb.
[19:12.390 --> 19:13.250]  Night lights.
[19:14.170 --> 19:15.570]  The silent B.
[19:16.410 --> 19:17.250]  Just think about
[19:17.250 --> 19:19.030]  how much money that $8,000 could be if you
[19:19.030 --> 19:19.870]  invest it well, though.
[19:20.090 --> 19:22.030]  I don't like whenever it's vertical.
[19:23.250 --> 19:24.490]  Okay, the chat is just
[19:24.490 --> 19:26.250]  a wall of cum.
[19:27.190 --> 19:28.770]  Oh, not this one again.
[19:30.350 --> 19:30.750]  Cumb.
[19:31.750 --> 19:32.010]  Okay.
[19:33.630 --> 19:35.010]  Alright, Geoff, you know how to turn the wheel?
[19:35.070 --> 19:35.430]  You got it.
[19:35.430 --> 19:36.370]  Yeah, I got it.
[19:38.550 --> 19:38.950]  Cumb.
[19:43.010 --> 19:44.950]  If I turn it hard enough, maybe I'll cumb.
[19:46.210 --> 19:47.390]  Oh, he's gonna cumb!
[19:49.170 --> 19:49.570]  Okay.
[19:51.190 --> 19:51.590]  No!
[19:52.750 --> 19:54.770]  Wow, Nick's really good at this.
[19:55.150 --> 19:55.770]  That's crazy.
[19:56.610 --> 19:57.550]  Wow, Nick's number one.
[19:58.010 --> 19:59.550]  I had a real jerky turn there.
[19:59.810 --> 20:01.410]  I went back to the lab, fellas.
[20:01.410 --> 20:01.710]  Oh, shit.
[20:02.750 --> 20:04.030]  Nick's been in the cum lab.
[20:05.070 --> 20:06.270]  Oh, with a B!
[20:10.050 --> 20:11.750]  Dude, for $8,000,
[20:11.950 --> 20:12.490]  that rocks.
[20:12.730 --> 20:15.230]  Yeah, but 25 years down the line, when you're texting someone
[20:15.230 --> 20:16.310]  with the word cumb,
[20:16.850 --> 20:19.070]  it's not gonna be annoying. What's wrong with you?
[20:19.130 --> 20:20.170]  Why do you keep writing it like that?
[20:20.510 --> 20:23.530]  How often are you saying that word
[20:23.530 --> 20:25.250]  to people? How often are you texting it?
[20:25.970 --> 20:27.490]  I don't know, I'm probably in triple figures
[20:27.490 --> 20:28.550]  throughout my lifetime, man.
[20:29.210 --> 20:30.190]  For cumb?
[20:30.770 --> 20:31.770]  No, no, for cumb.
[20:32.030 --> 20:34.950]  Who texts cumb so much?
[20:36.630 --> 20:36.890]  No!
[20:39.070 --> 20:40.530]  Yes, you're past it!
[20:41.730 --> 20:42.630]  Oh, Luigi!
[20:44.290 --> 20:45.350]  It's a jamboree, buddy.
[20:47.050 --> 20:47.610]  A jubilee.
[20:48.450 --> 20:49.470]  A jubilee, buddy.
[20:52.970 --> 20:55.050]  Can we get a cumb shirt?
[20:55.050 --> 20:55.630]  No.
[20:58.550 --> 21:00.190]  Who would own that?
[21:01.590 --> 21:02.750]  Does it say
[21:02.750 --> 21:05.070]  c-u-m-b, but the b looks like
[21:05.070 --> 21:06.610]  it's kinda like scratched out and faded?
[21:07.130 --> 21:08.770]  Like it's silent? I think it's just
[21:08.770 --> 21:10.410]  block letters c-u-m-b.
[21:10.910 --> 21:11.350]  Crazy.
[21:13.310 --> 21:13.710]  What if
[21:14.810 --> 21:16.610]  the c-u-m is glow-in-the-dark
[21:16.610 --> 21:17.510]  and the b is not?
[21:19.210 --> 21:20.430]  Glow-in-the-dark cumb!
[21:21.830 --> 21:22.810]  But it's not like
[21:22.810 --> 21:25.170]  it reveals cumb, it always said cumb
[21:25.170 --> 21:26.110]  it just said it with a b.
[21:27.750 --> 21:28.490]  Someone said
[21:28.490 --> 21:29.550]  release the cumbler.
[21:33.510 --> 21:34.850]  That's the worst cumbler
[21:34.850 --> 21:35.470]  in the world.
[21:37.030 --> 21:37.510]  Cumbler.
[21:38.370 --> 21:39.210]  Oh, man.
[21:40.310 --> 21:42.210]  Yeah, we should make a cumb shirt.
[21:43.590 --> 21:45.270]  Just like c-u-m-b
[21:45.270 --> 21:46.410]  impact letters, bam.
[21:46.610 --> 21:47.910]  People love it. People love cumming.
[21:49.510 --> 21:50.610]  Hey, Eric, remember when
[21:50.610 --> 21:52.410]  you could start telling people you knew
[21:52.410 --> 21:53.870]  about the show you worked on once?
[21:55.010 --> 21:55.530]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:57.970 --> 21:58.630]  This is the
[21:58.630 --> 21:59.790]  second time in a row you got one.
[22:00.010 --> 22:01.230]  I know, thanks for reminding me.
[22:01.630 --> 22:04.450]  Two people had to get it, so
[22:04.450 --> 22:06.050]  I'm gonna piss off down here.
[22:07.670 --> 22:08.490]  Hey, you shit,
[22:08.610 --> 22:09.390]  you got one again.
[22:09.850 --> 22:12.490]  Maybe we should make a cumb zone sign or something.
[22:13.810 --> 22:14.190]  Uh-oh.
[22:15.150 --> 22:16.190]  Item, minigame.
[22:17.510 --> 22:17.910]  Hmm.
[22:17.910 --> 22:18.510]  Hmm.
[22:20.810 --> 22:21.850]  Oh, no.
[22:22.250 --> 22:23.090]  Oh, okay.
[22:23.490 --> 22:24.510]  Oh, no.
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.340]  Welp, I'm already lost.
[22:31.720 --> 22:32.900]  Luckily, it's just Gavin.
[22:34.080 --> 22:34.600]  Ooh.
[22:35.900 --> 22:36.780]  What am I doing?
[22:37.320 --> 22:39.220]  You're trying to match.
[22:39.420 --> 22:40.060]  Dude, you rock.
[22:40.980 --> 22:42.860]  Dude, this is great, Gavin. You're doing great.
[22:43.280 --> 22:46.360]  How did you not match any so far?
[22:46.600 --> 22:48.120]  How did you get five
[22:48.120 --> 22:48.740]  items separate?
[22:49.820 --> 22:51.040]  That is more impressive.
[22:51.160 --> 22:53.400]  That was insane that you did that.
[22:53.900 --> 22:55.660]  How did you do that?
[22:56.400 --> 22:57.460]  That was honestly
[22:58.100 --> 22:59.160]  holy shit.
[22:59.640 --> 23:01.180]  That was actually so much cooler
[23:01.180 --> 23:03.460]  than I thought, man. Wow, I'm so
[23:03.460 --> 23:05.760]  off-board. Did you just do a magic trick
[23:05.760 --> 23:07.280]  to us? Did you do that on purpose?
[23:07.920 --> 23:09.640]  That was crazy. I just, like, revealed
[23:09.640 --> 23:11.380]  everything that was on offer that I picked
[23:11.380 --> 23:12.760]  exactly what I wanted somehow.
[23:13.460 --> 23:15.580]  What the hell just happened?
[23:16.460 --> 23:17.040]  No!
[23:18.060 --> 23:19.480]  Please, no!
[23:22.260 --> 23:23.900]  How did you do that?
[23:24.120 --> 23:24.860]  That was, like,
[23:25.500 --> 23:27.580]  just start flipping cards and then go
[23:27.580 --> 23:29.600]  what am I doing? It's, like, fucking
[23:29.600 --> 23:31.680]  wild. Magic is
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.540]  real. Well, I thought if I didn't match,
[23:33.600 --> 23:34.440]  I just wouldn't win.
[23:36.040 --> 23:37.160]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[23:37.600 --> 23:39.000]  Falcon signs are sold out.
[23:39.860 --> 23:40.400]  Wow!
[23:41.820 --> 23:43.400]  So no more Gerplers,
[23:43.400 --> 23:45.520]  no more Koozlers, no more Falcons,
[23:45.660 --> 23:47.500]  no more scrumping. Probably some t-shirts
[23:47.500 --> 23:49.620]  though. Yeah, we'll have the t-shirts in the store soon
[23:49.620 --> 23:50.980]  so that way there's something you can grab there
[23:50.980 --> 23:53.080]  if you're looking to impress
[23:53.080 --> 23:54.500]  someone on Gerpeltine's Day.
[23:54.960 --> 23:57.400]  Should we look into making more signs
[23:57.400 --> 23:59.380]  again if there's more demand
[23:59.380 --> 24:01.340]  for those? Or should we just switch
[24:01.340 --> 24:02.840]  to making a cum zone sign?
[24:04.420 --> 24:06.040]  Maybe one of the
[24:06.040 --> 24:07.480]  design signs we had
[24:07.480 --> 24:09.200]  when we all designed our own signs.
[24:09.960 --> 24:11.280]  Look where the star is.
[24:15.060 --> 24:16.500]  I don't have the coins.
[24:17.120 --> 24:18.300]  It's over on that ridge.
[24:18.440 --> 24:20.740]  Oh, you're also 47 away in that direction.
[24:21.140 --> 24:22.420]  53 that way.
[24:23.100 --> 24:24.160]  Oh my god!
[24:24.240 --> 24:26.100]  Oh no, that means I'm fucked too!
[24:30.320 --> 24:31.840]  Let's see, if I got one, two,
[24:32.040 --> 24:33.820]  three, four, five, six,
[24:33.980 --> 24:34.720]  I land there.
[24:36.640 --> 24:37.880]  Andrew is thinking.
[24:39.980 --> 24:40.800]  Andrew's thinking.
[24:41.340 --> 24:42.700]  Somebody said I fear there will be a merch
[24:42.700 --> 24:44.740]  overload soon. No, no there won't.
[24:44.820 --> 24:45.780]  We still have to buy all that shit.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.160]  Not for this, especially when
[24:49.180 --> 24:50.560]  every episode is people
[24:50.560 --> 24:53.040]  leaving comments going, can we get a shirt
[24:53.040 --> 24:54.620]  of this thing? Can we get a shirt of that thing?
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.840]  We've been so conservative about that.
[24:57.080 --> 24:58.880]  We don't make shirts about any of that stuff.
[24:58.940 --> 25:00.820]  I'm also not serious when I say
[25:00.820 --> 25:02.400]  about 70% of the merch ideas I say.
[25:02.520 --> 25:04.700]  We're not going to make a cumming shirt.
[25:05.460 --> 25:05.960]  It's just
[25:06.760 --> 25:08.600]  fun to antagonize Eric with a little bit.
[25:08.600 --> 25:09.940]  It's working!
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.600]  I do think a cum zone sign
[25:12.600 --> 25:13.280]  might work though.
[25:13.880 --> 25:16.560]  That is like the craziest thing you can
[25:16.560 --> 25:18.120]  hang in your house. Are you shitting me?
[25:18.400 --> 25:19.700]  It's got a bee in it.
[25:20.020 --> 25:21.600]  Nobody's going to think it's dirty.
[25:22.720 --> 25:23.540]  I think
[25:24.120 --> 25:26.760]  the bee will make it
[25:26.760 --> 25:27.720]  stand out more.
[25:29.160 --> 25:30.540]  Really, an eye-catching bee.
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.440]  Ah, the blocks!
[25:33.440 --> 25:33.640]  Well.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.660]  Imagine a professional
[25:36.660 --> 25:38.500]  email saying you want to order 10,000
[25:38.500 --> 25:39.260]  cum shirts.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.640]  You know what?
[25:44.700 --> 25:46.460]  They're going to ask, is this a misspelling too?
[25:46.780 --> 25:46.960]  Yeah.
[25:50.260 --> 25:52.640]  Anal passage to the cum zone.
[25:53.440 --> 25:54.940]  That's a pretty good point.
[25:55.180 --> 25:56.440]  The most successful shirt
[25:56.440 --> 25:57.700]  we've ever had
[25:58.620 --> 26:00.780]  was the anal passage shirt.
[26:01.320 --> 26:01.800]  Unbelievable.
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.560]  Alright, you boys are ready.
[26:04.560 --> 26:06.380]  Did the bottom one
[26:06.380 --> 26:07.140]  worth the most?
[26:07.860 --> 26:10.360]  Why would the bottom one be worth the most, Nick?
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.720]  I don't know, I'm just curious.
[26:11.820 --> 26:12.740]  It's where all the power is generated.
[26:14.100 --> 26:15.760]  Okay, time for Dilkong to hit yes.
[26:15.780 --> 26:18.200]  Sorry, I got wrapped up in the basketball.
[26:19.180 --> 26:19.720]  I know.
[26:21.800 --> 26:22.860]  Andrew's got hoop dreams.
[26:24.800 --> 26:25.760]  Give me that gold.
[26:29.280 --> 26:30.660]  Oh, why do I suck?
[26:33.360 --> 26:34.860]  Nick, are the bottom ones worth more?
[26:35.700 --> 26:36.780]  Don't know, I haven't reached one yet.
[26:38.500 --> 26:39.320]  I'll let you know.
[26:44.740 --> 26:45.780]  They make too many
[26:45.780 --> 26:46.960]  noises shooting the basketball.
[26:47.800 --> 26:49.820]  I don't like how many
[26:49.820 --> 26:50.700]  noises they make.
[26:53.180 --> 26:53.880]  Dammit, you
[26:53.880 --> 26:54.680]  son of a bitch!
[26:55.860 --> 26:57.820]  I didn't do anything for the first
[26:57.820 --> 26:58.260]  half of that.
[26:59.060 --> 27:01.620]  I didn't do anything for the second half, but your half
[27:01.620 --> 27:02.660]  is worth twice as many.
[27:05.420 --> 27:07.280]  I hit the rim so many times.
[27:13.110 --> 27:14.430]  That's a problem for me.
[27:20.670 --> 27:22.770]  Where do we get this bastard from?
[27:22.850 --> 27:23.510]  What island is he on?
[27:24.010 --> 27:25.070]  The one you're coming up on.
[27:26.330 --> 27:27.230]  You're close to him.
[27:29.210 --> 27:30.650]  I'll roll a couple more ones
[27:30.650 --> 27:31.230]  and I'll be there.
[27:31.990 --> 27:32.550]  Do you guys remember
[27:34.070 --> 27:36.170]  the time we made that shirt with
[27:36.170 --> 27:38.090]  just Jack's bald
[27:38.090 --> 27:38.650]  head on it?
[27:39.030 --> 27:41.270]  I forgot about that.
[27:41.390 --> 27:43.830]  That was like the craziest
[27:43.830 --> 27:46.130]  I couldn't believe that we made that.
[27:46.390 --> 27:48.010]  I have some other embarrassing photos
[27:48.010 --> 27:50.090]  of Jack that I always wanted to turn into shirts
[27:50.090 --> 27:52.090]  but now it doesn't make as much sense because of
[27:52.090 --> 27:54.250]  his teeth, but maybe it makes even more
[27:54.250 --> 27:56.050]  sense now, because what's he gonna do?
[28:00.650 --> 28:02.130]  Just antagonizing a guy who's
[28:02.130 --> 28:02.930]  not on the show.
[28:03.270 --> 28:03.590]  Yeah.
[28:05.070 --> 28:06.010]  But we love him.
[28:06.170 --> 28:08.310]  Oh, is that one of the guys on the show? Absolutely not.
[28:12.870 --> 28:14.950]  There's a picture of him holding a tray of
[28:14.950 --> 28:17.050]  chicken nuggets that I want to put on a t-shirt
[28:17.050 --> 28:17.850]  so badly.
[28:19.610 --> 28:20.850]  I had lunch with Jack last week.
[28:21.370 --> 28:22.190]  Oh, did you? How was it?
[28:22.210 --> 28:23.330]  It was great.
[28:24.630 --> 28:27.730]  Yeah, where'd you guys go?
[28:28.510 --> 28:29.530]  We went to Nando's.
[28:30.130 --> 28:30.610]  Wow!
[28:32.670 --> 28:33.630]  Cheeky Nando's!
[28:34.350 --> 28:35.790]  Where is that? Is that in the Arboretum?
[28:36.230 --> 28:36.530]  Shit.
[28:39.110 --> 28:39.750]  It's across
[28:39.750 --> 28:41.230]  from Colleen's.
[28:42.130 --> 28:43.650]  Huh. Was it good?
[28:44.890 --> 28:45.770]  It was alright, yeah.
[28:46.150 --> 28:47.350]  Was it about the same
[28:47.350 --> 28:48.550]  as you remembered? Yeah.
[28:49.570 --> 28:51.710]  And I had the extra hot and it wasn't
[28:51.710 --> 28:53.670]  hot in any way? It's not hot
[28:53.670 --> 28:54.990]  at all. Nope.
[28:55.630 --> 28:57.490]  You have to go and find the secret extra
[28:57.490 --> 28:59.510]  hot bottles that they have lying around.
[29:00.090 --> 29:01.370]  Are those the tiny ones?
[29:02.850 --> 29:03.410]  Where?
[29:03.410 --> 29:03.970]  They're a bit smaller.
[29:05.150 --> 29:06.870]  What? Shit!
[29:07.770 --> 29:08.110]  No!
[29:09.050 --> 29:10.850]  Is that the first island? Yep!
[29:11.410 --> 29:11.730]  Yep.
[29:12.370 --> 29:17.670]  I haven't gone from last
[29:17.670 --> 29:18.930]  to first with that star.
[29:20.030 --> 29:21.710]  The last time I played this game
[29:21.710 --> 29:23.490]  someone ended up stealing like two
[29:23.490 --> 29:25.550]  stars and then also being
[29:25.550 --> 29:27.290]  the only one who landed on the star platforms
[29:27.290 --> 29:28.390]  outside of that. Fuck.
[29:29.110 --> 29:30.410]  So he had like four at the end.
[29:31.950 --> 29:33.770]  And I think it traumatized me.
[29:34.190 --> 29:34.410]  Ha!
[29:35.270 --> 29:36.890]  Oh, he's getting some boo action.
[29:37.870 --> 29:38.110]  Oh.
[29:38.870 --> 29:40.110]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[29:43.750 --> 29:45.210]  Sorry Geoff, you have the most coins.
[29:45.390 --> 29:46.630]  Uh oh. Sorry.
[29:51.320 --> 29:53.040]  Fight him off, Geoff! Fight him off!
[29:53.160 --> 29:53.760]  Geoff, Geoff!
[29:53.760 --> 29:55.360]  Get the butt! Get the butt!
[29:55.360 --> 29:55.780]  Get the butt!
[29:59.800 --> 30:00.760]  Nine. Nice.
[30:02.440 --> 30:04.280]  I licked him for nine coins.
[30:05.260 --> 30:05.760]  Thank you!
[30:06.340 --> 30:07.940]  You sound like Andrew's avowed character.
[30:10.660 --> 30:11.460]  Same universe.
[30:12.000 --> 30:12.680]  Who am I versing?
[30:16.020 --> 30:17.500]  Oh, how much is on the line?
[30:18.560 --> 30:19.940]  It's time for the players to pull their coins.
[30:19.940 --> 30:20.900]  Oh, we're all playing.
[30:20.900 --> 30:22.560]  Oh, please! No, I want my money!
[30:22.960 --> 30:23.240]  No!
[30:23.780 --> 30:25.620]  You got 50 coins, Nick.
[30:25.980 --> 30:26.920]  Oh wow.
[30:27.600 --> 30:29.420]  Five coins. Big spenders.
[30:32.640 --> 30:34.700]  Nick's gonna steal my star.
[30:35.060 --> 30:36.400]  No, not yours.
[30:36.760 --> 30:37.000]  Oh.
[30:37.680 --> 30:38.680]  Thanks, Nick.
[30:41.780 --> 30:43.640]  I don't know, maybe...
[30:43.640 --> 30:45.660]  I'll remember who helps me in this.
[30:45.660 --> 30:47.280]  Double or seven.
[30:48.040 --> 30:50.420]  Wow, did we really sell 5,000 GURPS?
[30:50.540 --> 30:51.020]  We did.
[30:51.240 --> 30:52.760]  We did. Indeed we did.
[30:52.780 --> 30:53.500]  In nine minutes.
[30:56.280 --> 30:57.920]  Oh, wow.
[30:58.340 --> 30:59.180]  Oh, wow.
[30:59.560 --> 31:00.200]  Oh!
[31:00.640 --> 31:01.280]  Okay.
[31:01.700 --> 31:06.360]  We watch it, and then we get a chance to do it.
[31:07.640 --> 31:08.660]  Is there any...
[31:08.660 --> 31:09.740]  Watch the example.
[31:10.760 --> 31:12.560]  Watch the example closely.
[31:19.260 --> 31:19.940]  Got it.
[31:20.380 --> 31:21.140]  Got it.
[31:21.380 --> 31:22.380]  Gonna nail this.
[31:22.560 --> 31:23.800]  Yeah, I got it.
[31:23.820 --> 31:26.000]  Oh, this is gonna be easy.
[31:26.080 --> 31:28.300]  Is this on fucking baby mode right now, dude?
[31:29.400 --> 31:30.520]  Uh-oh, I forgot.
[31:30.760 --> 31:31.060]  Oh, shit.
[31:33.860 --> 31:34.900]  Mache for boost.
[31:38.620 --> 31:39.980]  You're a prick, I always do.
[31:43.100 --> 31:44.060]  And now!
[31:45.520 --> 31:46.700]  I can't believe we did that.
[31:46.800 --> 31:47.460]  Stop! Stop! Stop!
[31:49.380 --> 31:49.900]  No!
[31:51.740 --> 31:53.300]  Oh, my God, I got it!
[31:53.940 --> 31:55.940]  Yes! Me and Nick baby!
[31:56.600 --> 31:58.060]  Oh, my God!
[31:58.700 --> 31:59.180]  God damn it!
[31:59.200 --> 32:01.240]  God damn it, you're on the edge!
[32:01.580 --> 32:03.840]  I said it. I was joking.
[32:04.300 --> 32:06.480]  It worked. Nick, that ruled.
[32:08.920 --> 32:10.140]  Oh, my God.
[32:10.980 --> 32:12.000]  Oh, shit. Oh, man.
[32:13.100 --> 32:13.800]  Well, somebody
[32:13.800 --> 32:15.400]  asked us to do more Koozlers.
[32:15.840 --> 32:16.360]  For real?
[32:18.400 --> 32:20.000]  Is that a thing we should do again?
[32:20.080 --> 32:21.900]  Should we do a very small run of
[32:21.900 --> 32:22.640]  Koozlers again?
[32:24.580 --> 32:27.940]  Geoff, honestly, it sold out first.
[32:29.440 --> 32:29.980]  I know that
[32:29.980 --> 32:31.920]  it was a small number, but maybe we just do
[32:31.920 --> 32:32.660]  a small number again.
[32:33.280 --> 32:35.980]  Maybe what we do is just anytime we release Gerplers,
[32:36.100 --> 32:38.060]  we just do a small number
[32:38.060 --> 32:38.440]  of Koozlers.
[32:38.440 --> 32:38.980]  Okay.
[32:40.040 --> 32:42.660]  Maybe we'll do the next Koozler be a different color or something.
[32:43.060 --> 32:43.260]  Yeah.
[32:43.780 --> 32:44.920]  I couldn't take the risk.
[32:47.380 --> 32:48.420]  Get to explore
[32:48.420 --> 32:49.520]  Koozler colorways.
[32:50.080 --> 32:52.480]  Alright, how do I...
[32:54.900 --> 32:56.200]  I will say...
[32:56.200 --> 32:58.460]  You know what? I haven't won a single minigame
[32:58.460 --> 32:58.840]  today
[33:00.340 --> 33:01.820]  unlike some other people here.
[33:02.300 --> 33:04.280]  Wait, Nick, I don't like the way you're saying
[33:04.280 --> 33:06.320]  you know what. Hold on, I'm just
[33:06.320 --> 33:08.060]  I'm gonna close my eyes. What does that mean?
[33:08.100 --> 33:10.300]  There's a random button. I mean, you could hit a random
[33:10.300 --> 33:12.400]  button. Okay, random it is.
[33:15.120 --> 33:16.460]  He didn't hit the random
[33:16.460 --> 33:18.300]  button. I didn't look. What
[33:18.300 --> 33:19.500]  happened? Oh, it's Gavin.
[33:20.380 --> 33:22.100]  You just pressed on me.
[33:22.260 --> 33:24.320]  Yes, I don't believe
[33:24.320 --> 33:26.140]  Nick for a second. What do you mean?
[33:26.220 --> 33:28.320]  My eyes were closed. You know what? Actually, I believe
[33:28.320 --> 33:30.280]  Nick. I don't believe Nick
[33:30.280 --> 33:32.300]  for a second. Oh, what are you talking about?
[33:33.180 --> 33:34.560]  Andrew, I'd be quiet if I were you.
[33:34.560 --> 33:36.340]  No, I'm saying I agree with you. I'm on your side.
[33:36.900 --> 33:38.620]  Okay, thanks. I'm saying
[33:38.620 --> 33:39.460]  that you're clearly random.
[33:40.880 --> 33:42.560]  Clearly random. Nick is on the
[33:42.560 --> 33:44.480]  side of the last person he talked to.
[33:47.160 --> 33:48.600]  Nick, I just want to know why.
[33:49.940 --> 33:50.620]  You have more
[33:50.620 --> 33:52.220]  coins than Andrew? More coins?
[33:52.500 --> 33:54.380]  And you're doing better today. You're winning minigames.
[33:54.500 --> 33:55.420]  You're doing great. True.
[33:55.560 --> 33:58.360]  When you make a justification
[33:58.360 --> 33:59.800]  your voice goes up at the end.
[34:00.700 --> 34:01.060]  Oh, it did?
[34:02.760 --> 34:03.400]  That's weird.
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.100]  Alright, on this one you have to be the
[34:07.100 --> 34:08.580]  first to get under a sandwich.
[34:11.440 --> 34:12.960]  I mean, I like sandwiches.
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.140]  These actually look so good. I would love it
[34:15.140 --> 34:16.100]  if this was my basket.
[34:17.240 --> 34:19.100]  Are we supposed to go up or just
[34:19.100 --> 34:21.080]  avoid being crushed? We should have a day where we get together
[34:21.080 --> 34:23.060]  and have a picnic and eat sandwiches like this.
[34:27.520 --> 34:28.920]  Oh shit, they already won.
[34:31.060 --> 34:31.400]  Hahaha.
[34:35.840 --> 34:37.080]  I think Dilkong
[34:37.080 --> 34:38.420]  might have this one locked in, buddy.
[34:38.820 --> 34:40.400]  I'm locking in on these sandwiches.
[34:42.080 --> 34:43.040]  Gavin, look at the
[34:43.040 --> 34:45.400]  egg salad sandwich. It looks good.
[34:45.500 --> 34:47.160]  That's tremendous. I hope I'm under one of them.
[34:47.660 --> 34:48.920]  Yeah, me too. Oh, I want that caprese
[34:48.920 --> 34:50.660]  sandwich. That looks nice.
[34:50.960 --> 34:52.940]  Dude, I want all these fucking sandwiches. Look at these.
[34:54.600 --> 34:54.880]  You guys,
[34:54.960 --> 34:57.000]  only like 30 more seconds of this.
[34:57.560 --> 34:59.180]  Oh, Geoff narrowly avoiding
[34:59.180 --> 35:00.520]  two sandwiches. They're amazing.
[35:01.560 --> 35:03.180]  Geoff is locked in.
[35:03.540 --> 35:04.000]  Oh!
[35:05.180 --> 35:06.680]  You piece of shit!
[35:09.520 --> 35:09.960]  Damn.
[35:12.780 --> 35:13.900]  Good sandwiching, Geoff.
[35:16.930 --> 35:17.860]  Gavin, I'm really sorry.
[35:18.680 --> 35:21.020]  Well, you know.
[35:23.440 --> 35:25.080]  Gavin will remember that.
[35:25.860 --> 35:26.860]  I'll definitely remember that.
[35:27.420 --> 35:29.100]  I feel like I did better than three coins
[35:29.100 --> 35:29.440]  in that.
[35:30.240 --> 35:32.200]  Maybe just remember it at random.
[35:32.820 --> 35:34.920]  Yeah, I'll hit random and see if I
[35:34.920 --> 35:35.760]  remember it.
[35:38.920 --> 35:39.860]  Oh, man.
[35:42.480 --> 35:43.480]  Oh, no!
[35:44.420 --> 35:46.780]  Oh, wait, no! He's on the right island.
[35:47.520 --> 35:48.620]  Shit. Oh, no.
[35:50.700 --> 35:51.740]  Oh, boy.
[35:52.460 --> 35:54.840]  Use your warp box. I probably won't.
[35:57.280 --> 35:58.320]  Oh, Christ.
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.760]  That might not be enough. Oh, it's not. It's seven.
[36:03.500 --> 36:04.060]  Alright.
[36:04.640 --> 36:05.720]  See you soon, star.
[36:07.200 --> 36:07.560]  What?
[36:08.460 --> 36:09.500]  Another one?
[36:10.920 --> 36:11.480]  What?!
[36:11.480 --> 36:14.640]  Stop hitting my controller! Fuck me!
[36:15.960 --> 36:17.000]  Sooner than I
[36:17.000 --> 36:17.540]  thought.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.280]  Oh, fuck this game.
[36:21.700 --> 36:22.860]  What is this bullshit?
[36:23.120 --> 36:24.100]  He's right on the island.
[36:25.620 --> 36:26.220]  That's just
[36:26.220 --> 36:27.140]  how it goes sometimes.
[36:29.740 --> 36:31.940]  I'd hate to be Gavin right now.
[36:31.940 --> 36:33.440]  I'd hate to be Gavin most times.
[36:33.960 --> 36:35.600]  Why just right now?
[36:37.620 --> 36:39.900]  Hey, what the? Hey, what's up?
[36:40.260 --> 36:41.640]  Oh, shit.
[36:43.120 --> 36:43.900]  Oh, it's
[36:43.900 --> 36:44.940]  head-to-head time, baby.
[36:45.220 --> 36:45.640]  Oh.
[36:47.420 --> 36:49.520]  I'm cheering for both parties equally.
[36:52.020 --> 36:53.820]  Thanks, Andrew.
[36:53.940 --> 36:54.840]  Your support is appreciated.
[36:58.240 --> 37:00.200]  If you're watching this
[37:00.200 --> 37:01.880]  and you're excited
[37:01.880 --> 37:04.060]  and the Gerpler is something
[37:04.060 --> 37:05.860]  that you were able to grab or the signs
[37:05.860 --> 37:07.760]  or anything else in the store
[37:07.760 --> 37:09.940]  and you want to catch up on what
[37:09.940 --> 37:11.720]  regulation podcasts used to be,
[37:11.860 --> 37:14.140]  we put up something really interesting on our YouTube channel
[37:14.140 --> 37:14.480]  today.
[37:15.880 --> 37:18.020]  We put up the first 40 episodes
[37:18.020 --> 37:19.500]  in one 36-hour video.
[37:21.140 --> 37:21.500]  Uh...
[37:21.500 --> 37:22.740]  Yeah, let's just not find out.
[37:23.920 --> 37:25.200]  I want, uh,
[37:25.340 --> 37:27.420]  Gavin and Nick, the two architects
[37:27.420 --> 37:28.660]  of this, to talk about it.
[37:28.900 --> 37:31.200]  So, you guys can just kind of give us a rundown
[37:31.200 --> 37:32.280]  of the first 40 episodes.
[37:33.920 --> 37:34.980]  Where are you going to drop it, Nick?
[37:36.440 --> 37:37.260]  Wherever I want.
[37:41.340 --> 37:42.980]  You guys are doing a great job talking about it.
[37:43.160 --> 37:44.000]  What are we talking about?
[37:44.640 --> 37:46.680]  Oh, my God!
[37:47.140 --> 37:50.000]  But that's a good bounce for you! That's a really good bounce!
[37:50.000 --> 37:51.940]  Well, let me tell you about it, Eric.
[37:51.940 --> 37:54.340]  What we wanted to do is...
[37:54.340 --> 37:54.640]  Wow!
[37:56.180 --> 37:56.520]  Wow!
[37:57.200 --> 37:58.800]  Nick got screwed.
[37:59.940 --> 38:02.140]  Why don't you celebrate by talking about Season 1?
[38:02.580 --> 38:03.960]  Yeah. We put out all of
[38:03.960 --> 38:05.900]  Season 1 on YouTube of the
[38:05.900 --> 38:07.400]  original podcast.
[38:08.580 --> 38:10.060]  Uh, and new seasons to
[38:10.060 --> 38:11.380]  follow. Did you forget? Yeah!
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.900]  We don't have the rights to the music anymore,
[38:14.020 --> 38:16.080]  so we went back through and stripped
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.040]  the music. Uh-huh. It took a long
[38:18.040 --> 38:19.920]  time for Nick to get all the original files.
[38:20.040 --> 38:22.100]  How long? Why don't you talk about that, Nick?
[38:22.160 --> 38:23.980]  How hard was that? Uh, well,
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.100]  luckily, I had a majority of them,
[38:26.140 --> 38:28.020]  but there were some missing. I had to ask Gavin and Geoff
[38:28.020 --> 38:30.020]  to dig into their actual files to see
[38:30.020 --> 38:32.060]  if they had any. And then, uh, in some instances,
[38:32.060 --> 38:34.060]  you might hear a teensy bit of music behind
[38:34.060 --> 38:36.120]  Eric or Andrew because they didn't
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.380]  have the original files for a couple episodes here and there.
[38:38.380 --> 38:40.100]  Yeah. Um, we had the idea...
[38:40.100 --> 38:42.060]  Oh, go ahead. We had the idea to do it as
[38:42.060 --> 38:44.060]  seasons because I really can't wait to
[38:44.060 --> 38:44.960]  get to Season 3.
[38:45.440 --> 38:45.880]  Yes.
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.380]  The payoff of this joke is season 3.
[38:49.480 --> 38:51.080]  Yeah, exactly. But you can
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.860]  go now. It's on our, uh, the
[38:52.860 --> 38:54.740]  Regulation YouTube channel. It is a
[38:54.740 --> 38:56.920]  36-hour video. And Nick,
[38:56.980 --> 38:59.260]  you can just simply hit export on a 36-hour
[38:59.260 --> 39:00.960]  video, right? Oh, yeah. It turns
[39:00.960 --> 39:02.980]  out that, uh, well, we use
[39:02.980 --> 39:05.060]  Adobe Premiere for our
[39:05.060 --> 39:06.580]  video exports. Well, there's your problem.
[39:07.420 --> 39:09.080]  Well, and this also
[39:09.080 --> 39:11.020]  apparently happens in Final Cut as well, but
[39:11.520 --> 39:13.060]  they... once you hit 24, it
[39:13.060 --> 39:15.080]  considers to be a full day, and it will
[39:15.080 --> 39:17.060]  not export beyond that. So what
[39:17.060 --> 39:19.240]  I had to do is export in a 23-hour
[39:19.240 --> 39:21.300]  and then a 12-hour
[39:21.300 --> 39:23.220]  or whatever the difference would be, 14-hour.
[39:23.660 --> 39:24.840]  Uh, and then
[39:24.840 --> 39:26.360]  use another program
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.780]  that was free to combine
[39:28.780 --> 39:30.380]  the two files into one.
[39:31.180 --> 39:32.920]  And then, yeah,
[39:32.980 --> 39:35.160]  a lot of video players don't recognize it as
[39:35.160 --> 39:36.280]  being 36 hours.
[39:36.600 --> 39:38.820]  So it was a real test to see if YouTube would.
[39:40.540 --> 39:41.180]  And it
[39:41.180 --> 39:44.160]  did, luckily. Final Cut can do more than a day.
[39:44.500 --> 39:45.200]  Get it?
[39:45.200 --> 39:47.500]  Yeah. Oh, gold, dude. What is this?
[39:48.100 --> 39:48.820]  Hey, Gavin,
[39:49.040 --> 39:51.140]  why didn't you tell me that when I said we had a problem?
[39:51.140 --> 39:53.140]  Oh, is Gavin holding on to some information that would
[39:53.140 --> 39:54.700]  make everybody's life a little bit easier?
[39:54.920 --> 39:55.660]  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
[39:57.160 --> 39:59.260]  What a rare thing to happen.
[39:59.680 --> 40:00.920]  Hey, what'd you talk about this for?
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.840]  Wow. In the Slack!
[40:04.360 --> 40:04.560]  Huh.
[40:05.500 --> 40:07.700]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[40:08.160 --> 40:08.560]  God.
[40:09.580 --> 40:11.080]  Even I remember that.
[40:11.360 --> 40:12.440]  Yeah, dude!
[40:12.760 --> 40:14.860]  Oh. You may have commented on that.
[40:14.940 --> 40:15.980]  You did! You joked!
[40:16.140 --> 40:17.260]  You made a joke!
[40:17.440 --> 40:18.940]  What was my joke?
[40:20.580 --> 40:21.140]  Uh...
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.240]  Oh, you said something about not working more than 24 hours in a day.
[40:25.320 --> 40:26.420]  Just so you know,
[40:26.680 --> 40:29.060]  everyone, this is, uh...
[40:29.060 --> 40:30.820]  This is on the back
[40:30.820 --> 40:32.880]  of more Gavin withholding information
[40:32.880 --> 40:34.960]  yesterday in an entire
[40:34.960 --> 40:36.040]  day of recording.
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.220]  It created!
[40:37.840 --> 40:38.880]  And I don't feel...
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.980]  More Goombas?
[40:43.180 --> 40:44.020]  Is there gonna be
[40:44.020 --> 40:45.180]  some more bullshit Gavin excuses?
[40:47.840 --> 40:49.880]  It's raining Gavin excuses from the sky!
[40:50.600 --> 40:51.840]  There's so many Goombas.
[40:51.900 --> 40:53.600]  This is crazy. Oh my God, they're everywhere.
[40:53.680 --> 40:55.440]  Oh, it took out the old ones. Bullshit.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.040]  I just...
[40:59.040 --> 40:59.460]  No!
[41:00.780 --> 41:01.300]  No!
[41:01.300 --> 41:03.000]  I can't believe it when it's getting bad!
[41:14.920 --> 41:17.400]  Dude, I love that
[41:17.400 --> 41:18.300]  you knew a program like this.
[41:19.540 --> 41:20.380]  Oh no!
[41:21.420 --> 41:21.840]  Uh-oh.
[41:22.680 --> 41:23.860]  That screws me in, Geoff.
[41:27.640 --> 41:28.880]  Does it give it to everybody?
[41:31.300 --> 41:33.300]  It just evenly splits all the coins.
[41:33.840 --> 41:34.400]  Communism!
[41:35.060 --> 41:35.440]  Yay!
[41:38.240 --> 41:39.520]  Marks! Marks! Marks!
[41:39.580 --> 41:40.740]  God damn.
[41:40.740 --> 41:41.620]  That was great.
[41:42.280 --> 41:44.400]  That was the best Bowser roll of all time.
[41:45.740 --> 41:47.080]  That really worked out.
[41:47.740 --> 41:49.380]  Thank you, comrade Gavin!
[41:52.020 --> 41:53.100]  Son of a bitch.
[41:55.100 --> 41:56.700]  That's more than I had when you took it.
[41:57.140 --> 41:59.860]  Dude, Geoff, I emailed El Famoso
[41:59.860 --> 42:01.100]  and was like, hey, feel good about this?
[42:01.200 --> 42:03.820]  Ran down sort of everything, like, here's the game plan, here's what we're doing.
[42:03.940 --> 42:05.200]  Excited for this, blah blah blah.
[42:05.420 --> 42:07.620]  I got an email back from Kenny.
[42:08.140 --> 42:10.260]  In all caps, GERPLER!
[42:10.380 --> 42:11.980]  With five exclamation points.
[42:12.200 --> 42:13.800]  Here comes another explosion!
[42:14.180 --> 42:14.980]  That's the whole email.
[42:16.280 --> 42:17.240]  More Goombas!
[42:17.920 --> 42:19.180]  It's coming Goombas!
[42:20.980 --> 42:21.940]  Everyone in chat
[42:21.940 --> 42:23.300]  is saying, combrat.
[42:25.040 --> 42:25.520]  Combrat!
[42:26.180 --> 42:27.080]  There's the shirt!
[42:27.080 --> 42:28.100]  That's the shirt!
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.560]  I'm sorry, chat.
[42:34.160 --> 42:36.120]  This is a weird day.
[42:36.740 --> 42:39.040]  Do you think people at Twitch monitor words
[42:39.040 --> 42:41.140]  and suddenly it's like, the first time anyone's
[42:41.140 --> 42:41.740]  written cumb?
[42:42.680 --> 42:44.420]  And they're like, what is going on in the street?
[42:44.940 --> 42:46.700]  I was born for this!
[42:47.500 --> 42:48.540]  What's cumbrat?
[42:48.620 --> 42:50.660]  Why is it spiking for us?
[42:50.660 --> 42:51.220]  Thanks.
[42:53.100 --> 42:54.760]  Oh, it's the monkey dude.
[42:55.160 --> 42:56.980]  He's got monkey minions.
[42:57.380 --> 42:58.700]  Oh my god, we killed the monkeys!
[42:59.160 --> 43:00.380]  Let's see if we can do it again.
[43:00.560 --> 43:02.680]  Let's do monkey murder and then murder Dillkong.
[43:03.280 --> 43:04.780]  Murder my little Dills!
[43:04.920 --> 43:06.280]  Leave my little Dills alone!
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.480]  Oh my god.
[43:07.960 --> 43:09.880]  So you can't hit him? Yeah, you can.
[43:10.400 --> 43:12.320]  Yeah, you're supposed to, I think.
[43:12.640 --> 43:14.680]  His little bitches are just running interference for him.
[43:15.440 --> 43:16.980]  Leave my little Dills alone!
[43:17.360 --> 43:18.800]  Oh shit, I hit Geoff in the back.
[43:18.800 --> 43:19.300]  Get Dillkong!
[43:21.500 --> 43:22.380]  Get Dillkong!
[43:22.760 --> 43:25.080]  Forget the monkeys, get Dillkong!
[43:25.420 --> 43:26.480]  Get my little...
[43:26.480 --> 43:27.080]  Hold on!
[43:29.560 --> 43:30.260]  We're good.
[43:30.720 --> 43:31.260]  No!
[43:32.560 --> 43:33.100]  No!
[43:35.240 --> 43:36.760]  Oh my god, Nick.
[43:36.780 --> 43:37.360]  You got this.
[43:37.500 --> 43:38.020]  Yeah!
[43:40.380 --> 43:41.320]  What a throw.
[43:42.140 --> 43:44.240]  I reamed Geoff in the back of the head and immediately
[43:44.240 --> 43:45.040]  got hit myself.
[43:48.500 --> 43:48.940]  Wow.
[43:49.760 --> 43:50.200]  Wow.
[43:50.960 --> 43:51.760]  Oh god.
[43:53.580 --> 43:54.680]  Hello, comrades.
[44:00.180 --> 44:00.720]  New turn.
[44:01.120 --> 44:03.160]  Does anybody else wish they had gone pee right before
[44:03.160 --> 44:03.860]  we started recording?
[44:04.440 --> 44:05.680]  We can take a piss break if you want.
[44:06.080 --> 44:08.200]  Maybe later. I'll wait a bit.
[44:08.380 --> 44:09.120]  Maybe after your turn.
[44:10.500 --> 44:12.380]  Maybe I will. It would be so cool.
[44:12.760 --> 44:13.980]  Oh, you got the longest time.
[44:14.280 --> 44:16.100]  That would be cool.
[44:17.140 --> 44:18.460]  Oh, that's not cool.
[44:18.500 --> 44:19.500]  That was a real cool turn.
[44:23.080 --> 44:23.400]  Motherfucker.
[44:24.840 --> 44:25.560]  Alright, I'm gonna go.
[44:28.560 --> 44:30.740]  Let me get some of these goldy gooms.
[44:31.720 --> 44:32.500]  Alright, you can
[44:32.500 --> 44:33.820]  finally say all the stuff you want to say.
[44:34.940 --> 44:35.760]  Wow, way to go.
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.220]  Hey, you're a lucky boy.
[44:37.220 --> 44:38.380]  Sucks!
[44:40.380 --> 44:41.500]  Waste these rolls
[44:41.500 --> 44:42.580]  today, bastard.
[44:43.040 --> 44:44.120]  Oh, double dice.
[44:44.640 --> 44:45.960]  Two ones.
[44:53.500 --> 44:55.520]  I'm gonna get some of these golden gooms.
[44:56.560 --> 44:57.440]  What do they
[44:57.440 --> 44:59.540]  give you? Five coins.
[44:59.820 --> 45:00.040]  Oh, wow.
[45:02.920 --> 45:04.860]  What do we got?
[45:07.220 --> 45:07.660]  Ooh.
[45:08.940 --> 45:10.980]  Is the golden warp pipe let you pick
[45:10.980 --> 45:12.220]  which person you go to?
[45:12.820 --> 45:13.020]  Yep.
[45:13.360 --> 45:16.740]  Is that what the golden warp pipe does?
[45:16.980 --> 45:17.160]  Yep.
[45:17.400 --> 45:20.860]  The green one just takes you to a random other player.
[45:21.000 --> 45:21.200]  Oh.
[45:25.420 --> 45:26.720]  Give me that goom goom.
[45:28.240 --> 45:29.160]  The gold pipe
[45:29.160 --> 45:30.180]  takes you straight to the star.
[45:30.380 --> 45:31.460]  That's what I thought.
[45:31.820 --> 45:34.200]  They are telling me differently, so I don't know.
[45:34.200 --> 45:36.380]  Well, I asked Andrew, and he bought the damn thing.
[45:36.380 --> 45:37.440]  Why did he correct me?
[45:37.660 --> 45:39.640]  Why would I want you to know that I could do that?
[45:40.280 --> 45:41.880]  I'm gonna remember that when I hit boo.
[45:42.080 --> 45:42.820]  I feel like a new man.
[45:43.560 --> 45:46.460]  I played this with Jackie and Alfredo, and I had a
[45:47.680 --> 45:48.400]  golden pipe,
[45:48.560 --> 45:50.440]  but I also had five stars, so she kept calling
[45:50.440 --> 45:51.020]  me a pussy.
[45:51.720 --> 45:52.440]  That's awesome.
[45:54.640 --> 45:56.680]  She would call me a pussy if I didn't drop it,
[45:56.740 --> 45:57.760]  so I just threw it on the ground.
[45:58.080 --> 45:58.760]  That's awesome.
[45:59.900 --> 46:00.620]  Bowser, please.
[46:03.020 --> 46:04.180]  It's your old buddy, Mario.
[46:04.180 --> 46:05.200]  I lose a star!
[46:05.860 --> 46:06.380]  What?
[46:07.840 --> 46:08.360]  Again?
[46:10.200 --> 46:11.600]  I think this might be...
[46:11.600 --> 46:12.640]  Oh, it fucked me!
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.400]  Yeah, I think this might be okay for me.
[46:16.560 --> 46:17.080]  How?
[46:18.400 --> 46:20.120]  Well, now that I'm rich, I don't like
[46:20.120 --> 46:21.280]  communism anymore.
[46:21.980 --> 46:24.640]  I'm starting to understand the 1%
[46:24.640 --> 46:25.080]  here.
[46:26.100 --> 46:27.120]  That's not too bad.
[46:27.380 --> 46:29.620]  I doubled my coins. Thanks, Nick.
[46:30.360 --> 46:31.260]  Andrew is...
[46:31.260 --> 46:32.560]  Andrew is shit.
[46:32.880 --> 46:33.580]  Thanks, comrade.
[46:34.220 --> 46:36.820]  He just made his old pay for his pipe.
[46:38.560 --> 46:39.460]  Not the first
[46:39.460 --> 46:40.640]  time he paid for my pipe.
[46:43.200 --> 46:44.920]  What the fuck does that mean?
[46:46.400 --> 46:47.300]  I don't know, but
[46:47.300 --> 46:48.060]  it's sexual.
[46:48.960 --> 46:50.820]  Oh! Hey, J!
[46:50.980 --> 46:53.220]  Oh, it's me and Dilkong, my favorite
[46:53.220 --> 46:53.540]  customer.
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.200]  Let's jump the gun.
[46:56.800 --> 46:58.280]  We gotta shoot him in the fucking face.
[46:58.280 --> 46:59.700]  Oh, you're dead as dicks.
[46:59.740 --> 47:00.660]  It's just an FPS.
[47:03.860 --> 47:05.580]  Oh, this is crazy.
[47:06.080 --> 47:07.440]  Andrew, how far apart you want him?
[47:09.340 --> 47:09.720]  Oh.
[47:10.020 --> 47:10.740]  Oh, I see.
[47:12.180 --> 47:13.140]  We'll figure it out.
[47:13.460 --> 47:14.460]  Don't do that on the night.
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.580]  Alright, let me know when you're ready, Nick.
[47:17.960 --> 47:18.740]  I got it.
[47:19.780 --> 47:20.580]  You gotta hit start.
[47:21.540 --> 47:26.100]  Oh, this is gonna be bad.
[47:26.660 --> 47:27.680]  No, no, it's gonna be fine.
[47:27.780 --> 47:29.000]  I wish I was the one shooting.
[47:29.500 --> 47:29.900]  Why?
[47:31.620 --> 47:32.520]  Because I'm bad.
[47:32.840 --> 47:33.260]  Oh, I see.
[47:37.160 --> 47:37.960]  God damn.
[47:39.040 --> 47:39.440]  Shit.
[47:41.600 --> 47:42.280]  Come on.
[47:43.220 --> 47:44.020]  It's so...
[47:44.020 --> 47:44.560]  I suck.
[47:45.820 --> 47:47.400]  There we go. Okay, locked in.
[47:48.960 --> 47:49.200]  Nope.
[47:49.300 --> 47:50.080]  That was a good shot, Geoff.
[47:50.140 --> 47:52.440]  I shouldn't have sucked.
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.280]  I'll just keep blasting.
[47:54.740 --> 47:56.360]  Yeah, keep going.
[47:56.960 --> 47:58.380]  You're doing great.
[48:00.440 --> 48:00.920]  No!
[48:03.040 --> 48:03.620]  God damn it.
[48:04.940 --> 48:06.020]  Okay, here we go.
[48:07.620 --> 48:08.360]  Here we go.
[48:08.560 --> 48:09.980]  Oh, you didn't shot me.
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.420]  This is crazy.
[48:12.360 --> 48:12.920]  Well done.
[48:15.140 --> 48:16.220]  Sorry, Geoff.
[48:16.320 --> 48:17.720]  That's alright. It happens to everybody.
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.280]  Finally, I won one.
[48:19.280 --> 48:20.760]  Hey, it's okay.
[48:20.940 --> 48:22.200]  It's all for the greater good, comrade.
[48:27.060 --> 48:28.500]  What the fuck am I watching right now?
[48:28.580 --> 48:30.580]  It's called Mario Party Jamboree.
[48:30.860 --> 48:33.420]  It's a relatively new game on the Nintendo Switch.
[48:34.200 --> 48:35.340]  The four of us are playing it.
[48:35.860 --> 48:36.940]  And if you just joined,
[48:37.100 --> 48:39.240]  the amount of time you're after is nine minutes.
[48:39.660 --> 48:40.600]  Nine minutes.
[48:41.720 --> 48:42.700]  Low tide!
[48:43.400 --> 48:44.120]  Low tide!
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.720]  The tide is low,
[48:46.820 --> 48:49.000]  so we're walking on it.
[48:49.000 --> 48:49.980]  Roll tide.
[48:53.500 --> 48:54.800]  Alright, Geoff, Shirley this time.
[48:55.760 --> 48:56.560]  And don't call me Shirley.
[48:58.340 --> 48:59.400]  I said Geoff first.
[49:00.520 --> 49:01.860]  Good job, Geoff.
[49:02.720 --> 49:04.220]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[49:05.900 --> 49:07.580]  Geoff takes the lead!
[49:08.040 --> 49:08.160]  Wow.
[49:08.860 --> 49:11.440]  Listen, I'm not saying we make
[49:12.320 --> 49:13.120]  this shirt,
[49:13.840 --> 49:15.560]  but Optimal Towel
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.080]  just put this on this side.
[49:18.020 --> 49:18.540]  Pfft.
[49:19.280 --> 49:20.900]  Where? Can we sell a cum towel?
[49:23.360 --> 49:24.960]  It's cracking me.
[49:25.260 --> 49:27.140]  It's cracking me.
[49:27.460 --> 49:29.080]  I mean, I mean...
[49:29.620 --> 49:29.840]  Come on!
[49:29.980 --> 49:32.880]  That is so...
[49:32.880 --> 49:33.860]  I...
[49:33.860 --> 49:36.480]  It's the worst. It's the worst.
[49:36.880 --> 49:39.020]  Like, no human has ever looked worse than that.
[49:40.440 --> 49:41.140]  Hey, Gav.
[49:41.320 --> 49:42.740]  It sounds like I'm going to be licensing
[49:42.740 --> 49:44.760]  one of my images to my other company.
[49:44.760 --> 49:46.100]  Yeah, uh,
[49:46.580 --> 49:48.640]  now suddenly I do want to make that shirt.
[49:49.620 --> 49:51.100]  Yeah, I'm kind of...
[49:51.100 --> 49:52.500]  I'm kind of...
[49:52.500 --> 49:53.360]  I'm in.
[49:53.700 --> 49:56.240]  I like the idea of presenting Dan with the release form and being like,
[49:56.420 --> 49:57.020]  so what do you think?
[49:58.200 --> 50:00.380]  He's not going to know what is happening.
[50:00.660 --> 50:02.500]  Just show him the shirt without the letters.
[50:02.640 --> 50:04.620]  What if we just make like 400 of them,
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.260]  you know, just to get it out of our system.
[50:06.700 --> 50:07.140]  Man.
[50:07.140 --> 50:08.920]  That's kind of awesome.
[50:09.740 --> 50:10.620]  Limited cum.
[50:13.060 --> 50:14.100]  It's just...
[50:14.100 --> 50:14.900]  It's like...
[50:14.900 --> 50:17.360]  It's like what I imagined the character from like,
[50:17.420 --> 50:19.320]  I have no mouth, but I must scream.
[50:22.900 --> 50:24.360]  Can we hit A?
[50:25.980 --> 50:26.500]  Somebody...
[50:26.500 --> 50:27.480]  Thank you.
[50:28.440 --> 50:29.540]  Oh, no!
[50:30.540 --> 50:31.520]  Oh, no!
[50:32.440 --> 50:33.480]  Did you pass it already?
[50:33.680 --> 50:35.040]  Did you pass it already?
[50:35.360 --> 50:36.980]  That is so fucking funny, Eric.
[50:36.980 --> 50:38.080]  Oh, my God.
[50:41.940 --> 50:42.980]  Oh, Christ.
[50:43.440 --> 50:44.000]  Oh, man.
[50:44.500 --> 50:44.860]  Poor Dan.
[50:48.960 --> 50:50.180]  Yeah, poor Dan.
[50:50.500 --> 50:51.800]  Must be real rough to be Dan.
[50:52.660 --> 50:53.700]  Oh, man.
[50:55.140 --> 50:57.440]  I mean, after that shirt goes up, it might be.
[50:57.720 --> 50:58.640]  It's cum.
[50:59.020 --> 50:59.860]  Oh, my God.
[51:01.060 --> 51:03.840]  Gavin, I need you to roll a three.
[51:03.840 --> 51:06.520]  Well, watch out, because here comes two ones.
[51:07.660 --> 51:09.380]  What if we promised that
[51:10.480 --> 51:11.920]  all proceeds went to
[51:11.920 --> 51:13.400]  explaining the joke to Dan?
[51:17.780 --> 51:18.700]  All proceeds?
[51:19.160 --> 51:20.000]  Low, low, low.
[51:20.020 --> 51:20.380]  Yes!
[51:20.980 --> 51:21.920]  Oh, there's hope!
[51:22.280 --> 51:23.920]  One, one, one, one!
[51:25.520 --> 51:25.980]  Nice.
[51:27.120 --> 51:27.800]  Wait, can I vote it?
[51:28.540 --> 51:29.620]  Oh, wait, where am I going?
[51:30.140 --> 51:31.200]  To the star.
[51:32.780 --> 51:33.480]  Oh, buy it!
[51:33.580 --> 51:34.760]  Buy something, buy anything.
[51:36.300 --> 51:37.180]  Buy the pipe.
[51:37.920 --> 51:38.600]  No, don't buy the pipe.
[51:39.960 --> 51:40.980]  Nick doesn't know.
[51:41.620 --> 51:43.960]  This is when the guy put in the wrong address
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.040]  because he was panic ordering.
[51:45.900 --> 51:46.260]  No!
[51:47.040 --> 51:48.680]  No, I didn't get what I wanted from the restaurant.
[51:51.820 --> 51:52.540]  Oh, man.
[51:55.660 --> 51:57.160]  Hold on, I'm going to mark that so I can
[51:57.160 --> 51:58.760]  put the image in the video.
[51:58.900 --> 51:59.120]  Yeah.
[52:06.300 --> 52:07.240]  Oh, wait, can I
[52:07.240 --> 52:08.720]  do it in the actual file?
[52:08.960 --> 52:09.320]  Oh, I can.
[52:11.660 --> 52:12.140]  Marker.
[52:12.660 --> 52:13.800]  Damn, I'm good.
[52:14.380 --> 52:15.660]  You got a star!
[52:16.120 --> 52:19.020]  Hey, congrats! Welcome back to the pack,
[52:19.400 --> 52:19.600]  Gavin.
[52:20.620 --> 52:21.500]  Thank you!
[52:22.860 --> 52:23.660]  Oh, wait!
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.060]  Oh, wait.
[52:25.100 --> 52:25.520]  No!
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.220]  No, it's two behind me!
[52:30.520 --> 52:34.720]  Ooh, you get a verse.
[52:36.280 --> 52:37.220]  Item minigame?
[52:37.340 --> 52:38.680]  Oh, versus minigame.
[52:38.700 --> 52:40.100]  Sounds like a coin minigame.
[52:40.700 --> 52:43.260]  Let's try and do more than five, make it worthwhile.
[52:44.340 --> 52:44.660]  Oh!
[52:44.780 --> 52:45.200]  No!
[52:48.340 --> 52:49.460]  Holy shit.
[52:49.660 --> 52:51.660]  This could be catastrophic for old Geoff.
[52:51.660 --> 52:53.820]  Yeah, two star Geoff.
[52:53.900 --> 52:55.980]  Please not a jerk-off game.
[52:58.180 --> 52:59.120]  Cold front.
[52:59.380 --> 53:01.180]  Once again, born for this.
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.280]  Born for this.
[53:04.620 --> 53:05.040]  Cold front.
[53:06.220 --> 53:07.760]  Oh, this is just like
[53:07.760 --> 53:08.140]  Canada.
[53:10.500 --> 53:11.180]  Perfect.
[53:11.440 --> 53:12.240]  Yeah, let's do that.
[53:13.720 --> 53:15.840]  Okay, let's do it.
[53:16.720 --> 53:19.600]  Which one?
[53:20.840 --> 53:21.860]  He's puffin'.
[53:22.200 --> 53:23.240]  He's huffin' and puffin'.
[53:23.240 --> 53:24.580]  Slippery as penis.
[53:25.780 --> 53:26.880]  Drew in the chat.
[53:27.380 --> 53:29.920]  Update, there are now 1,697
[53:29.920 --> 53:31.480]  Discord members with the
[53:31.480 --> 53:33.020]  Scrumpers role and zero
[53:33.420 --> 53:33.760]  Falconeers.
[53:34.020 --> 53:34.420]  No!
[53:37.620 --> 53:40.440]  I was born for this!
[53:41.080 --> 53:42.200]  He wins all of them?
[53:42.380 --> 53:43.180]  This is ridiculous.
[53:43.500 --> 53:44.880]  The rich get richer.
[53:45.300 --> 53:47.360]  I underestimate how the grip
[53:47.360 --> 53:49.260]  is gone and you can't even move to
[53:49.260 --> 53:49.960]  where you want to move.
[53:50.860 --> 53:51.980]  It's okay.
[53:52.660 --> 53:54.360]  Oh, I lost four!
[53:54.880 --> 53:56.920]  I lost a lot.
[53:58.300 --> 53:59.360]  That was big.
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.700]  I will not be using my gold pipe for a while.
[54:05.440 --> 54:07.540]  1,697 Scrumpers now
[54:07.540 --> 54:08.480]  in Discord.
[54:09.440 --> 54:10.000]  Crazy.
[54:12.740 --> 54:14.400]  This little motherfucker.
[54:14.400 --> 54:15.980]  The scrumpers have spoken.
[54:16.140 --> 54:18.480]  They shouted louder than the loudest
[54:18.480 --> 54:18.860]  falcon.
[54:19.620 --> 54:20.500]  It's true.
[54:22.040 --> 54:24.400]  The falcons looked up and whispered
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.240]  help me and then the scrumpers
[54:26.240 --> 54:27.640]  looked down and screamed no.
[54:28.620 --> 54:29.960]  These are my apples!
[54:31.200 --> 54:32.580]  Oh shit, there's a goomba on the field?
[54:35.320 --> 54:36.660]  Son of a bitch!
[54:37.700 --> 54:40.140]  This is gonna be loaded with golden pipes.
[54:40.860 --> 54:42.780]  No! He has two of them!
[54:42.780 --> 54:43.780]  I was laying pipe, dude.
[54:43.960 --> 54:45.500]  I'm piping all over.
[54:46.120 --> 54:48.320]  You guys don't even want to see what's going on over here.
[54:49.640 --> 54:50.760]  He's basically paying
[54:50.760 --> 54:53.040]  45 coins per star, but he's rich.
[54:59.140 --> 55:00.960]  Mario time is right behind me.
[55:16.720 --> 55:17.140]  Yeah.
[55:21.420 --> 55:24.940]  Well, it's gonna be on sale in the next turn.
[55:35.560 --> 55:37.380]  Does anybody have Valentine's Day plans?
[55:38.500 --> 55:39.080]  I might go do
[55:39.080 --> 55:40.260]  a late lunch or something.
[55:43.200 --> 55:45.580]  My kid has a Valentine's thing at his school
[55:45.580 --> 55:46.420]  at 3.30.
[55:47.820 --> 55:49.340]  So, I guess I'm gonna go
[55:49.340 --> 55:50.440]  on again, off again.
[55:50.540 --> 55:51.900]  Let him hand out candy to kids.
[55:54.780 --> 55:57.360]  Those kind of things are so much fun
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.060]  but also usually inconvenient
[55:59.060 --> 56:00.440]  and kind of annoying at the moment.
[56:01.920 --> 56:03.040]  Man, when they're over
[56:03.040 --> 56:04.500]  and you realize you're never gonna do it again,
[56:04.720 --> 56:06.460]  you fucking miss the shit out of it.
[56:06.720 --> 56:07.620]  Oh, interesting.
[56:08.240 --> 56:09.520]  Enjoy it when you can, man.
[56:09.520 --> 56:12.680]  I was driving by Millie's grade school
[56:12.680 --> 56:15.040]  and I was thinking about all the school
[56:15.660 --> 56:17.400]  programs I went to where she would dance
[56:17.400 --> 56:18.580]  or sing or whatever, you know?
[56:19.300 --> 56:21.300]  I got really bummed that I would never see that again.
[56:21.700 --> 56:22.100]  Interesting.
[56:24.080 --> 56:25.120]  Will you press start now?
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.700]  We're not playing.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.640]  Sorry, he was lamenting.
[56:28.900 --> 56:31.540]  I was just lamenting.
[56:31.680 --> 56:32.340]  I was being nostalgic.
[56:32.580 --> 56:33.800]  I get it, man.
[56:35.100 --> 56:36.460]  I've already reached a stage where it's like,
[56:37.580 --> 56:39.340]  he's getting big to the point where
[56:39.340 --> 56:41.600]  he's like, soon I probably won't be able to pick him up.
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.500]  It's such a
[56:43.500 --> 56:44.940]  cliche thing where you're like,
[56:44.940 --> 56:46.880]  you know, they grow so fast
[56:46.880 --> 56:48.900]  and it's so brief, but it's only
[56:48.900 --> 56:51.160]  because it's so absolutely true that you hear it
[56:51.160 --> 56:51.740]  over and over again.
[56:53.020 --> 56:53.800]  Oh shit!
[56:54.140 --> 56:56.800]  The days are long, the years are short. That is very true.
[56:58.440 --> 56:59.440]  Cliche, but also true.
[56:59.820 --> 56:59.980]  Oh!
[57:02.180 --> 57:03.920]  You can do it, Dilkong!
[57:05.260 --> 57:05.700]  Yeah!
[57:07.200 --> 57:08.200]  There you go!
[57:13.940 --> 57:14.840]  These streams are
[57:14.840 --> 57:16.180]  available later, you can watch them
[57:16.180 --> 57:18.140]  on Regulation Gameplay on
[57:18.140 --> 57:19.640]  YouTube or the Patreon.
[57:20.520 --> 57:22.080]  ScaryGhosty says that Geoff.Sucks is
[57:22.080 --> 57:23.800]  back up. Oh, hell yeah!
[57:23.880 --> 57:26.340]  Did you buy it again, Gavin? Oh, the URL you own?
[57:26.600 --> 57:28.280]  See, I told you it wasn't Gavin.
[57:29.340 --> 57:30.200]  Never owned it.
[57:30.540 --> 57:31.400]  Who owns it?
[57:31.880 --> 57:34.480]  Someone else. Probably whoever ScaredyGhost is.
[57:34.860 --> 57:36.180]  And I'm sure they've contacted
[57:36.180 --> 57:38.120]  any of us on Instagram to go like,
[57:38.160 --> 57:40.260]  I'll give it to you, and it's a whole fucking ordeal.
[57:40.880 --> 57:41.840]  So. Oh, wow.
[57:42.580 --> 57:43.780]  Oh, half the cost.
[57:44.940 --> 57:45.680]  Are you
[57:45.680 --> 57:47.340]  shitting me? Balls.
[57:47.480 --> 57:50.020]  Pretty solid internet connection from everybody today so far.
[57:50.060 --> 57:50.320]  Yeah!
[57:51.420 --> 57:53.440]  Go ahead and knock on this.
[57:57.120 --> 57:57.620]  Ugh!
[57:57.800 --> 57:59.260]  I wish I had hit my triple.
[57:59.820 --> 58:01.200]  I don't have any money anyway.
[58:01.320 --> 58:01.660]  It doesn't matter.
[58:04.240 --> 58:05.740]  Y'all stole
[58:05.740 --> 58:06.380]  all my money.
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.440]  Fucking $6 a month.
[58:09.460 --> 58:10.760]  I need to get an extra value meal.
[58:11.820 --> 58:13.220]  They're like $9 now.
[58:16.280 --> 58:16.680]  Wallet.
[58:17.660 --> 58:18.060]  Again.
[58:19.340 --> 58:21.400]  That's not the first time you did that too. That's crazy.
[58:21.460 --> 58:23.120]  But you're up above the tide now.
[58:23.200 --> 58:23.540]  Cool.
[58:28.160 --> 58:29.120]  Hey, there you go.
[58:29.420 --> 58:30.220]  As far as you want.
[58:31.620 --> 58:32.640]  A guaranteed 10.
[58:32.820 --> 58:33.740]  Son of a bitch.
[58:35.240 --> 58:37.220]  No, I don't think Geoff.com is available.
[58:38.160 --> 58:39.760]  ScaredyGhosty says, I have always owned
[58:39.760 --> 58:41.700]  Geoff.sucks and I've offered to give it to the crew
[58:41.700 --> 58:43.300]  for free since they mentioned it.
[58:43.300 --> 58:45.080]  And no one ever responds to me.
[58:45.120 --> 58:46.900]  But also, I told
[58:46.900 --> 58:47.660]  Andrew.
[58:49.520 --> 58:49.780]  What?
[58:50.760 --> 58:53.040]  Sorry, I'm too busy getting a star. I can't hear you.
[58:53.420 --> 58:54.320]  And I told Nick.
[58:56.300 --> 58:57.300]  Geoff can tell me.
[58:57.480 --> 58:59.040]  ScaredyGhosty, that's very kind.
[58:59.700 --> 59:00.180]  No!
[59:01.320 --> 59:03.260]  Where did you mention it
[59:03.260 --> 59:04.160]  when nobody responded?
[59:07.120 --> 59:08.740]  Oh no, I'm so nervous.
[59:09.640 --> 59:11.380]  You shouldn't have
[59:11.380 --> 59:12.480]  You should have said no.
[59:12.600 --> 59:14.300]  Because now what if you lose the star?
[59:14.640 --> 59:17.340]  So I shouldn't get
[59:17.340 --> 59:18.040]  the star
[59:18.040 --> 59:20.760]  in the event that I don't
[59:21.320 --> 59:23.300]  It's better to not get it than to have
[59:23.300 --> 59:24.940]  loved and lost. Yeah, that's what they say.
[59:25.320 --> 59:27.260]  It's better to have never loved
[59:27.260 --> 59:29.040]  at all than to
[59:29.040 --> 59:31.340]  suffer any inconvenience or loss in your life.
[59:31.540 --> 59:33.480]  It's better to be alone your entire life.
[59:34.860 --> 59:35.440]  Oh, email
[59:35.440 --> 59:35.980]  and Twitter.
[59:36.700 --> 59:38.320]  I don't even have Twitter.
[59:38.320 --> 59:39.300]  I don't either.
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.260]  But if you want to DM me
[59:42.260 --> 59:43.600]  on the old Instagram, I can
[59:44.460 --> 59:45.640]  chat to you there about it.
[59:46.620 --> 59:47.780]  Yeah, Gavin is our webmaster.
[59:48.640 --> 59:49.960]  He's our major domo.
[59:50.580 --> 59:51.400]  Lose one star. Lose one star.
[59:52.740 --> 59:53.940]  He's our sysadmin.
[59:55.920 --> 59:56.780]  That really hurts.
[59:56.940 --> 59:57.500]  Oh, now that
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.460]  is pretty harmful actually.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:00.960]  Wow.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.380]  That really throws
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.080]  a whole wrench in what I had cooking here.
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:07.780]  Fuck.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:09.940]  And all your gold
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.020]  pipe pieces. All my plans have kind of been
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.940]  fucked by that. Kind of all fell apart there, huh?
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.080]  Yeah.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.060]  Shit.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.980]  Go and do another communism and you'll be fine.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.660]  Go rebalance the scales.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.360]  I don't even know where it is.
[01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:36.370]  I could
[01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:38.250]  have let Gavin...
[01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.190]  Yeah, this is better.
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:40.770]  Yeah, you get it now.
[01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.710]  Oh, somebody said we should do a subathon
[01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.870]  with the stretch goal being Gavin getting
[01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:47.850]  a cumba tattoo. That's a great idea.
[01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:48.970]  Oooh.
[01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.530]  Hey, I could get my eight grand.
[01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:58.150]  Eight grand.
[01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:00.150]  It's such
[01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.150]  a funny number. I know, I really
[01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.330]  like the low amounts.
[01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:05.990]  They're just mild inconveniences.
[01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:07.490]  Yeah. Oooh.
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:10.090]  I could have just won a couple mini-games.
[01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.070]  If I could have done an MDB that was like
[01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:14.030]  maybe more of like a six thousand
[01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:16.230]  dollars bet, I would love that.
[01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:18.050]  Six thousand dollars.
[01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.010]  Yeah.
[01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.050]  Because it's a lot on the day you get it, but over the span of
[01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.910]  your lifetime, it's just like, where did it go?
[01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.870]  That's why you invest wisely.
[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:31.710]  That's why you gotta buy meme coins.
[01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:34.430]  Oooh.
[01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:35.690]  Oh, you only lost eight though.
[01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.650]  Good job, Dilkong.
[01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:41.290]  Way to fight it off.
[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:45.410]  Nick's clawing his way back into this thing.
[01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:46.690]  Oh, baby.
[01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.270]  I'm going.
[01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:53.690]  Cum crypto-comics.
[01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:59.130]  I will let you know that if we ever
[01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.530]  start a cryptocurrency, yeah, if we ever
[01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:03.730]  start cumcoin, I just want to let you know
[01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:05.590]  right now, I will rug-pull you.
[01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.150]  So, do invest.
[01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:11.690]  I'm real up front about like
[01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:13.570]  I'm gonna rug-pull you.
[01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.770]  Everybody knows not to invest in
[01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:17.310]  cum. Cum is a pump and dump.
[01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.710]  Exactly. I love the dollar sign
[01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.250]  cum just looks like scum.
[01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.530]  Scum. Okay, I like this mini-game
[01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:24.030]  a lot.
[01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.970]  Fucking whack him.
[01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:29.310]  I was born for this!
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.370]  Oh, you're literally
[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:32.870]  a mole. That's not good.
[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:35.650]  He's literally whacking the mole.
[01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:40.630]  Get out of there!
[01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.030]  It's two on the nose.
[01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.950]  No! It's too easy!
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.950]  No!
[01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:53.070]  God! Let me die!
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:55.550]  Please! Gavin, come back!
[01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.090]  Gavin, help me!
[01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:59.530]  It's like, remember
[01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:01.330]  35 years ago, bitch? Ow!
[01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.050]  This is Donkey Kong revenge porn.
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.310]  Oh, we all got money.
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.710]  You guys still ended up with more than I had
[01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.090]  somehow.
[01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:13.430]  Marco's cum trading sign looks great.
[01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:15.570]  Dollar sign cum.
[01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.510]  Oh!
[01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:27.590]  Oh, we're getting there!
[01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.430]  We're about to get a daisy!
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:33.450]  And lost!
[01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.770]  Do I get some sort of
[01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:36.770]  little chump gift?
[01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:38.510]  I hope not.
[01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.650]  Now that we're in the home stretch.
[01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.210]  Let's take away six.
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.430]  Those will be duels.
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.430]  Anyone can pull ahead.
[01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:50.130]  Oh, what?
[01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:51.890]  What?
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.470]  Oh, no! More chance time!
[01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.110]  Yes! Wow!
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:59.790]  Okay! Hell yeah!
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:01.030]  What do those do?
[01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.790]  You pick two people and you pick what it does between them.
[01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:07.110]  It could be move coins, it could be switch stars,
[01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:08.810]  it could be anything.
[01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:09.950]  Oh.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:12.690]  It's a real nice space to
[01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.070]  land on if you're in fourth.
[01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.070]  Hide-tied!
[01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:22.130]  Roll-tied!
[01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.970]  We're getting on to time on this
[01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:30.390]  thing, too. Very interesting.
[01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.150]  Only a few rounds left.
[01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.670]  How are you feeling, Nick?
[01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.810]  I'm pretty confident.
[01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.690]  Until Andrew does.
[01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:39.130]  Nice!
[01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:41.770]  Here we go!
[01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.090]  Hey, what's up? You wanna be my friend?
[01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:44.590]  Give me some money.
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.170]  You pay me five bucks a day
[01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.970]  and you can hang out.
[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:50.630]  That's awesome!
[01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.930]  Well, you have to earn the right
[01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:55.130]  first, Geoff. We'll see.
[01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:58.050]  I wonder if it's the painting.
[01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:00.030]  Please not the puzzles again!
[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.970]  God, we can't let Andrew have it.
[01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:06.910]  No matter what.
[01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.990]  You're next to the star, too.
[01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:10.750]  Yeah, but
[01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.130]  you're gonna get there instantly.
[01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:13.150]  Yeah, but so are you!
[01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.590]  Guys, we have to stop Andrew!
[01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:17.230]  Yeah, but you!
[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.130]  You have the shortest
[01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.110]  cuts of all!
[01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.950]  Instant!
[01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.350]  Geoff starts with a three-point advantage.
[01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:27.510]  Hell yes, I do.
[01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.690]  Oh, damn.
[01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:30.910]  Suck my butthole.
[01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:40.590]  Ow!
[01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.270]  Ow, I'm getting smashed silly!
[01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:43.970]  Oh, you...
[01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.390]  Oh, what a steal!
[01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:48.390]  Uh-oh!
[01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:50.590]  Uh-oh!
[01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.510]  That was the big one, too.
[01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:54.630]  Oh, fuck!
[01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.810]  I have to stop Andrew!
[01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:57.570]  Where is he?
[01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:00.250]  Hmm...
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.430]  He's the one getting all the coins.
[01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:04.710]  No, I went the wrong way, you stupid moron!
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.290]  Did I steal it?
[01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:07.610]  Oh, shit, there's more rounds?
[01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:08.630]  Oh my god, boys.
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:11.450]  Yeah, there's a lot of rounds.
[01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.150]  Dilkong is monkeying around here.
[01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.590]  Oh my god, Andrew!
[01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:17.550]  How did you get a three?
[01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:18.750]  What a move, there it is!
[01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:19.510]  Gotta get the red ones!
[01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:23.330]  Let me back in the game!
[01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.730]  Get over here, get over here, get over here!
[01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.490]  Oh my god, he got a four!
[01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.430]  Wow!
[01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:32.430]  I didn't do nothing!
[01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.110]  I didn't do anything!
[01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:37.810]  I've done nothing!
[01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.950]  He's killing it right now!
[01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.850]  Alright, last round, here we go, boys!
[01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.610]  Don't let him touch him!
[01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:46.410]  Kill the monkey!
[01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:48.530]  No!
[01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.750]  It's all behind me, damn it!
[01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.890]  Oh, yes! Good job, Wario!
[01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:57.910]  I'm so proud of you, I'm gonna die!
[01:06:58.770 --> 01:06:59.310]  There it is!
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.390]  Andrew!
[01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:01.550]  Stop, Andrew!
[01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.710]  Andrew!
[01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:06.450]  No!
[01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:07.730]  He's going ape shit!
[01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:11.490]  Andrew, you gotta make something happen here!
[01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:12.970]  God damn!
[01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:14.110]  Oh no!
[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.130]  Whoa!
[01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:20.870]  No, fuck off, Andrew!
[01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:22.550]  Go to hell! Yes!
[01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:23.610]  What am I doing?
[01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:23.910]  Oh no!
[01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:29.290]  No! Who got it?
[01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:29.830]  Who got it?
[01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:32.750]  We're neck and neck!
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:35.570]  Give me the coins!
[01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:36.390]  Give me the coins!
[01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:38.010]  No!
[01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:41.870]  I think it just
[01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:43.110]  slipped away from Andrew!
[01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:44.550]  Yeah, no!
[01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.830]  Oh, Geoff got it!
[01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:48.610]  Geoff got it!
[01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.350]  Gavin had 38!
[01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:54.650]  Oh!
[01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:56.910]  Good job, Geoff!
[01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:59.630]  Thank God for that nine coin boost
[01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:00.370]  I had at the beginning.
[01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.790]  Gavin?
[01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:05.350]  You what? You moved too far?
[01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:07.610]  Yeah, let's team up. I already told you, you pay me
[01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:08.710]  five coins, you can be my friend.
[01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:11.770]  Which, by the way,
[01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:12.890]  Gavin, your five coins are due.
[01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:13.510]  Yeah.
[01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:17.370]  You missed this payment. Yeah. Let's go.
[01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:18.050]  Huh.
[01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:21.490]  Huh.
[01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.350]  Oh, what a
[01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:23.690]  savings he's about to get.
[01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.010]  Dude, what a gerpal times day today
[01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:27.570]  has been. Oh, so wonderful.
[01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:30.070]  This has been really great. I don't want a bite of your
[01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.390]  crap.
[01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:34.090]  You got it for half
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:35.870]  off and two items! I don't want it.
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:37.870]  I don't need that shit. It's crutch.
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.770]  You're... okay.
[01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:42.030]  Does that mean
[01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:43.010]  this is gonna happen twice?
[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:44.670]  Oh, interesting.
[01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:46.750]  Double
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:48.050]  the goombas!
[01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:50.050]  Double your fun.
[01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:52.710]  Nope.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.790]  Yup.
[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.770]  God, you're gonna
[01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.050]  make so much money. Yeah.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.190]  Cum coin?
[01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:02.250]  Thank you.
[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.010]  Pump and dump, baby.
[01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.310]  Hahaha.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.960]  What you looking at?
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.080]  I think I want pizza.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.120]  You're gonna get some pizza? Doesn't that sound good?
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.480]  Pizza sounds good.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:21.540]  What type of pizza?
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:22.740]  I don't know.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.380]  Any pizza? Great. Yeah, I kinda don't care.
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:27.940]  Just sounds good.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:28.960]  Go home slice.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.160]  Go to Costco with Nick and get the slicing
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.280]  pepperoni there.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.460]  It's so fucking good, dude.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.080]  Do they do that or adopt? I just had some on Saturday.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:38.520]  Ugh.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.720]  It's good ass pizza, dude.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:43.020]  What are you doing, Wario?
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.760]  He's just fucking about.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.880]  Did you find out where you're going?
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.160]  Big roll by you.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.560]  So I have enough money for Boo.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.280]  Well...
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.960]  Hahaha.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.960]  Well, you know who you have to take it from.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:03.900]  The guy in first?
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.520]  With the most coins?
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:08.940]  Payback. Yeah.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:09.840]  Payback.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.780]  Now, don't be
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.760]  What am I supposed to do to fight it?
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.140]  Give in to the dark side.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.220]  I think you shake the controller.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.860]  You put it behind you.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:25.840]  Ten.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.100]  Oh, perfect.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.740]  That shit won't be forgotten.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.120]  I've already...
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:32.380]  What?
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.880]  Nick is always out for revenge
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.180]  and it doesn't matter on who.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:40.320]  It's true.
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.980]  He just walks out the door every morning
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.880]  just saying, wrong me! Anyone!
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.340]  Payback's a bitch.
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.040]  I'll land on that chance time.
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.560]  Roll a nice two.
[01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:59.700]  Nice little ten.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.280]  Sweet ten.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.600]  Oh my god.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.120]  Oh god.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:12.780]  What'd you buy?
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:15.600]  Yep.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.840]  You better stop making money so you can use these.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.540]  My plan!
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:25.060]  There's some money.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.820]  Oh, come on!
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  Hell yeah!
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.120]  That's better than money.
[01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:35.150]  Alright.
[01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:35.870]  Alright.
[01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:41.650]  Well, I'm vogued.
[01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:46.170]  Oh, I got past your trap though.
[01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:49.010]  Somebody asked if we think Nick is wearing the cum mask today.
[01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:51.090]  No, I don't think so.
[01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:52.550]  He's saving it for later.
[01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:01.870]  Double the coins!
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.900]  Ooh, it's domination.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.000]  What one's this?
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.340]  I don't know.
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:19.860]  What?
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.380]  Oh dang, you better hammer.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.680]  Oh boy.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.140]  Andrew, you built for this?
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.300]  No, I wasn't.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.640]  But Dilkong was!
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.840]  That's what I'm talking about, baby!
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:35.880]  Troller disconnected, hold on.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.360]  Gavin, I told you!
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.420]  There we go!
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.520]  Jesus.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.720]  Here we go.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.240]  Come on, Dil!
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.340]  Come on, Dil!
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.040]  Let's go, Dil!
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.340]  Come on, Dil!
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.580]  Wow!
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:08.860]  Keep it going, Dil!
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.240]  Wow!
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:11.720]  Wow!
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.700]  Almost 100.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.300]  I got an achievement for that.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.860]  Dude, crazy.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.380]  Dilkong was built for this, baby.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.580]  You thought about doing those marathons
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.600]  on your wrists?
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.300]  What?
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.260]  I don't even know what Nick asked.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.560]  I had no idea what he said.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.440]  Remember how he was going to do the marathon?
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:36.640]  You should walk it on your wrists.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:37.800]  Look at how fast you are.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:38.480]  Okay.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.700]  This guy is messed up.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.180]  There's something wrong with this guy's brain.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.400]  He's 12 times better than Mario.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.820]  Oh, I didn't want to do that.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.020]  Why did I do that? Can I go back?
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.340]  He's going with the triple.
[01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.330]  Now!
[01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.070]  Now!
[01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.250]  Now!
[01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:08.750]  32.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.210]  Now!
[01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:12.710]  Could have been less.
[01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:14.110]  Could have been worse.
[01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:15.790]  Pretty good.
[01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:21.830]  You can buy two pipes.
[01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:25.310]  You can lay pipe big style.
[01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:27.730]  And it's half off for him.
[01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:29.650]  No way!
[01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.750]  Oh, shit!
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:32.530]  Wow!
[01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:33.890]  Uh-oh.
[01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:35.870]  Geoff, you don't need anything.
[01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:40.150]  Geoff is suddenly a real problem.
[01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:41.410]  Yeah.
[01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:43.050]  With two goldy pipes.
[01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:45.790]  I'll eat those.
[01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:46.430]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.490]  In my tummy.
[01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:53.590]  Oh, I see. You don't get two for free.
[01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.250]  Excellent.
[01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.550]  I guess I'll go ahead and buy a...
[01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:58.410]  Yeah.
[01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.530]  Geoff, you should clear your space
[01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:03.890]  by getting rid of the gold pipe.
[01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.430]  Yeah, I'll probably have to get rid of one of my gold pipes
[01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:07.510]  to make room for the other one.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:14.780]  Wow.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:17.820]  Damn it!
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.720]  I was really excited about that Goomba.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.340]  Tastes great.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:25.680]  What?
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.900]  Oh, it's Wario time?
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.660]  Hmm.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.060]  Okay, let's see.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.620]  Is there a chance time nearby?
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.320]  No.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.220]  No, they're all by the volcano.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.560]  To get down there.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.120]  Okay.
[01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.930]  Dude, some people in the chat...
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:53.670]  You want to hear something crazy?
[01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:57.710]  Some people in the chat said they just received their shipping info for the...
[01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:58.250]  They have.
[01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.770]  They're working on it right now.
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:02.990]  They're printing labels,
[01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:05.150]  getting everything ready, and then it should be
[01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.770]  pretty quick, pretty easy
[01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.230]  to get them all out to you guys
[01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:10.930]  in the next week
[01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:11.630]  or so.
[01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:14.170]  Everything is happening. That's what we do on a weekday.
[01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:20.950]  I don't know. 25 for a golden pipe.
[01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.790]  That seems pretty crazy.
[01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:23.130]  In this economy?
[01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:25.590]  I'd try to go for 2 for that price.
[01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:27.490]  I just wouldn't do it just in case.
[01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:29.810]  What if something happens and somebody takes it?
[01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:31.550]  Nice little sub, Gonzo.
[01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.710]  You know?
[01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:35.790]  I kind of need to be able to...
[01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:37.210]  Afford things. Yeah, I agree.
[01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:40.710]  Keep going.
[01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:43.650]  Shit!
[01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:48.190]  This is a risk.
[01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.490]  What does the shell do
[01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:54.090]  in your inventory?
[01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:55.450]  It moves the tide.
[01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:58.910]  Well, that's useless.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.060]  Oh, he got it.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.240]  Fuck it up.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:10.940]  Damn.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.360]  I'm so glad he did that.
[01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:18.450]  What you got?
[01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:22.650]  What the hell is that?
[01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:24.630]  It moves the star.
[01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:26.810]  Which would be cool if there weren't
[01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:28.110]  6 golden pipes.
[01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.050]  And why is it
[01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:38.650]  freaking out, Gavin?
[01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:40.690]  It's in a different room.
[01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.910]  Great.
[01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:46.070]  I wonder what Andrew's
[01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.470]  going to do.
[01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.570]  Go get some Goombas.
[01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:53.490]  I want to look at the board
[01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.530]  for a sec.
[01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:56.490]  Okay.
[01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:58.270]  Wish I could look
[01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:59.010]  at the board right now.
[01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:03.110]  Apparently it is
[01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.590]  because of today's chat.
[01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:06.570]  We might give it a shot
[01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:06.910]  again.
[01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:10.670]  Oh, I forgot I steal
[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:10.930]  her!
[01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:13.810]  Yeah, you just grabbed her.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.720]  Son of a bitch.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.600]  She won't pay you to be friends
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.240]  anymore. What the hell?
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.960]  I got money out of her, I'm good.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.280]  Oh, interesting.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:31.920]  Oh, here's your
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.680]  second one.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.760]  What is that?
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.260]  There are so many
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.220]  golden pipes in play. This is insane.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.080]  Yeah, and I don't have a single item.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.720]  Are we doing Mario Party March?
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:48.820]  I believe we are, aren't we?
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:51.420]  Depends on if someone gets back to me about the times.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.820]  Yeah, I'm good.
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.580]  Oh.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:55.920]  Okay.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.420]  You're really good
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:18:59.960]  with that time.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:01.460]  Okay.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:04.740]  Okay, golden pipe.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.480]  Might as well.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.480]  The last turn is gonna be
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.440]  four
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.540]  stars for every turn.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.820]  That may have been a mistake.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.280]  Am I gonna land on
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.680]  Andrew's money? Please.
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.100]  Yeah!
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:25.920]  I'm an idiot.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:28.900]  Finally!
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.240]  Yeah, 10 coins.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.440]  I didn't realize it was a one-time use.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.280]  Oh, how sad
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.500]  for you! Damn.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.260]  Damn. There are seven
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:45.400]  gold pipes in the game.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.360]  Can we afford to use
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.900]  them? Unlikely.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.020]  Starts now.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.100]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.800]  This is gonna be bad.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.800]  This is good for the economy.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.780]  Nick needs this.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.380]  I'm gonna need you to fuck off.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:01.700]  Okay.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.000]  Mario Party March.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.340]  Every day.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.420]  It's on the calendar.
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.060]  Oh boy.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:12.980]  Okay.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.040]  Okay.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:17.180]  No, get off me, you little son of a bitch.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:19.480]  Oh!
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:21.540]  No!
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:25.580]  No.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.140]  Eat shit!
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.360]  Eat shit, Donkey Kong!
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.640]  Yes! I got it, I think!
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.540]  So sick of this.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:38.400]  Come on, you can't reach it as hat!
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Wow, I didn't do bad.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.720]  Jeez. Terrible.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.000]  Man, I spent
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.920]  most of the game on Andrew.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:47.900]  You sure did.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.080]  Nick is like the
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.980]  nicest, sweetest guy outside
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.540]  of Mario Party where he's just
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.980]  jumping on your head going, get out of here, asshat!
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.480]  It's awesome.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.860]  He gets hyper competitive. It's awesome.
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.180]  There's losing and there's winning.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.320]  You get
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.980]  this, Nick, when it's Mario Party
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:08.100]  or a UT game.
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.180]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.180]  I would say Cowboy's
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.260]  Game, but that's been a long time.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.200]  Maybe you can start getting excited
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:18.740]  about the Spurs.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.220]  I'm loving the Spurs. They're fun.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.140]  They're losing, but they're still
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:25.460]  fun. Oh, thank God.
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.640]  Here it is.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:28.520]  Play pipe.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.960]  Oh, I didn't anticipate
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.360]  this.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.740]  You didn't anticipate
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:38.400]  what are you talking about?
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.620]  I'm three spaces
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.580]  ahead of him and I stole Daisy.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.560]  I thought he would steal
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.020]  Daisy back before
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.800]  moving on. I'm not even sure about Daisy.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.560]  You get two stars with her.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.160]  I did not know that.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.620]  Listen, a one
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.540]  star in the hand is worth two in the
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.820]  Daisy. It's true.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.760]  So Andrew has the potential
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.360]  for four stars from pipes.
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:02.960]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.920]  Oh, balls.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.400]  Interesting. We have to stop him
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.400]  somehow. There is a way.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.420]  Oh. Yeah, but nobody's
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:14.940]  by it.
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.420]  Let's keep it that way.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.500]  Just keep pummeling chance times until something happens.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.540]  He doesn't even need the warp pipe.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.700]  He's right there.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.320]  I mean, Daisy's going to leave
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.540]  in like two turns.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.200]  Oh, at the end of the game?
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:34.520]  Perfect.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:39.320]  Huh.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.020]  Yeah, get him, Nick.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:42.660]  Yeah.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.560]  Sorry, Gavin. It wasn't meant...
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.500]  No, you're right.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.780]  It was more like, well, that
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.360]  boned still.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:54.040]  Oh.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.020]  Oh.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:55.920]  Oh.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:58.680]  Oh, enough for
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.500]  two stars.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.780]  Alright. We've got to get some work
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.100]  done now. Alright.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.720]  Hit the bricks. Time to lock in, boys.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.720]  How many away is this?
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:11.980]  It's fourteen.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.940]  So it's on the top left.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.940]  Not the star, you idiot!
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:18.820]  Didn't say what you were
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.600]  looking for, to be fair.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.800]  You know what? He is absolutely correct in that.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.080]  It's ten.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.880]  Ten away. Do it.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.500]  Oh my god.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.920]  Oh my god.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.060]  You have to
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.880]  destroy him, or he will only
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.920]  come back stronger.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.760]  What's he doing?
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.020]  Oh, I know exactly what
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:41.520]  he's doing.
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.620]  Oh no!
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.040]  Oh yes!
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.780]  Oh god.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.500]  The great
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:55.760]  unequalizer.
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.160]  I don't like how it's starting.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.540]  Close your eyes. Wait, don't you like
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.320]  how it's starting? Oh yeah,
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.200]  never mind. Keep it this way.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.280]  I like this.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.420]  Chance time. I honestly just
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:09.660]  don't even want to see my face up here.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.680]  Okay, what do we want to...
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.580]  Close your eyes. Go down.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]  You know what? No.
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.340]  I'm going to involve the people first, and then we'll see what happens.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.460]  Oh god, let fate
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:21.320]  decide. Yep.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:23.420]  Oh,
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.240]  I don't like this. Oh,
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.060]  this is not good.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.340]  This is the worst. That couldn't possibly
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.480]  be any worse for Nick. You and me, Nick!
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.920]  You and me, son!
[01:24:37.090 --> 01:24:38.170]  That was...
[01:24:38.850 --> 01:24:39.390]  No!
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:42.550]  No!
[01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.310]  Hey, you mixed up.
[01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:47.170]  Boo.
[01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.590]  I don't want to roll because I want to use my shit.
[01:24:51.490 --> 01:24:51.970]  Oh
[01:24:54.270 --> 01:24:54.750]  no.
[01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:56.930]  Alright, here comes a couple of stars
[01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:57.570]  for Andrew.
[01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:02.690]  We're going to have to
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:04.370]  chance time. We're going to have to keep chance timing.
[01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.470]  Crazy.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.620]  Thank you.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:15.940]  Wow.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  Oh, you get to pay.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:18.600]  Okay.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.280]  She doesn't give you half price off the stars?
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.720]  Damn it. I thought that...
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:26.540]  Yes, thank god, dude. That would be crazy.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.160]  I got two of them! Look at them!
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.580]  They're so pretty!
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.520]  Where's the next one?
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:38.760]  It doesn't matter where it is.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:40.920]  Because we'll be there.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.520]  Goombas!
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.640]  Freaking Goombas!
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.320]  Wow, I didn't do the lava
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.560]  a single time this game.
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:57.540]  What do you mean the lava?
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:00.720]  Sometimes there's lava and every...
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.180]  every time you hit it you lose five stars.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.320]  Yes!
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:05.700]  Lose a star!
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.940]  Do you get to go to Bowser twice
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:10.600]  because of Daisy?
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.960]  What if the punishment is twice as bad?
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.020]  Lose two stars!
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:15.980]  Lose two stars.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:18.720]  Lose a star.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.380]  Lose a star.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.260]  No!
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.540]  You're a piece of shit!
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.200]  Fuck you! Bullshit!
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.480]  Oh wait, no, it helps me. Nevermind.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:30.460]  We all essentially have equal. Yeah, Nick.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.980]  You like this.
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:32.760]  Come back.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.300]  There's been so much
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.760]  cumbiness in this game.
[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.500]  Let's split them up.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.300]  Damn it!
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:42.980]  Shit.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:44.640]  Alright.
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:47.380]  Alright.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.740]  Now if I win the minigame, I can't afford
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.580]  boo! Alright, now Daisy
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.200]  gets sucked back in with you.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.420]  Yeah, go in. Get in again.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.620]  Go. Go straight in.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:57.640]  No!
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:26:59.940]  Are you kidding me?
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.880]  Are you kidding me?
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:02.440]  No!
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:06.100]  What?
[01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.640]  Lose a star. Lose a star.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:09.860]  Goddamn star.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.300]  Oh, come on.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.680]  Lose 40 coins.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.260]  Lose 40 coins.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.340]  Shut up!
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.260]  That's crazy.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:21.540]  That
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.900]  sucks. That was so cool.
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:24.680]  That was awesome.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.340]  That was fucking rad. I'm so happy that happened.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.260]  Alright, now we just
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.420]  need to make sure that Andrew can't afford to use his pipe.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.760]  Right. Agreed.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.020]  So no wins for the monkey.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.960]  Let's see. Board.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.200]  Uh...
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:40.800]  You got a chance.
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.400]  Time nearby.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.180]  The closest one is the one you're on.
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.120]  You can't stop
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:47.920]  the Dilkong.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.800]  Don't even try! You know what? I can play
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.700]  to my advantage though. Hold on. I have an idea.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.260]  Because there's two over by the star.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:01.420]  So.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.140]  Theoretically, I get star.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:03.880]  I loop.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.940]  I take Andrew's shit.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.560]  Yeah. Interesting.
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.140]  You guys are acting like I've got 60 more stars
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.160]  than everybody here. I have one more than Nick.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.840]  You have the potential for it.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:17.020]  You have what?
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.200]  I have one more than Nick and the inability to buy anymore.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.220]  Yeah, until the mini-game.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.560]  That I keep losing.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.600]  That's true. You know what?
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.460]  You won one mini-game and it was like a team-up game.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:31.180]  That's a fair point. Yeah.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.160]  You're welcome, by the way.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.560]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:35.740]  You're welcome.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.200]  Uh-oh. Oh, thanks.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.440]  Oh, you can just walk to it?
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.480]  You gotta keep...
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.320]  Oh, shit. It doesn't put you on it, does it?
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:49.440]  No.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.160]  You can always loop it.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.380]  Yeah, I'm gonna loop.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.480]  Oh, fuck me.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.980]  Oh, I'm on his team!
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:01.700]  Oh, I can...
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.340]  I know what I have to do.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.600]  I know what I have to do.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.120]  Oh, shit.
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:11.720]  We know what we have to do, Gavin.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.300]  We have to eat shit. We have to sneak.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.540]  We have to throw the game.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:17.140]  No.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.300]  That's so frowned upon.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.160]  No.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.380]  Is that frowned upon?
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:24.540]  Yeah, it has to be done.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:25.780]  Eh.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.620]  Alright, Gavin, you just tell me which one you're going with and I'll go with it.
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:31.720]  What if you don't press something?
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.700]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.140]  What if I...
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:37.700]  I guess we won't find out.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.640]  I guess let's refrain from...
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.820]  I'm just gonna think about this.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:44.820]  Where is he gonna go?
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.140]  Could be down that way.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:48.380]  Could be anywhere.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.960]  God, I'm so confused.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.540]  This is rough.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.000]  Yeah, this is tough, guys.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.620]  Where is this gonna be?
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:57.440]  Where could he be?
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360]  Right out of time.
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.060]  Oh, he sure did.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.960]  Oh, it just kicks randomly?
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.040]  Okay.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:07.060]  Uh, okay.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.260]  I'm gonna really think about this next one.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.760]  Yeah, I'm gonna think about this next one.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.940]  We should pick the same one, Gavin.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.460]  Andrew, how you feeling?
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.220]  Will remember.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:19.180]  Gavin?
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:20.440]  Gavin?
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.020]  Nick, what one do you wanna pick?
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.240]  I like left.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:23.840]  Okay.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.680]  We just fucked.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:28.380]  Oh, okay.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.060]  Oh, no.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.660]  Oh, rats.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.480]  Alright, Geoff, what if I picked pink next time?
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:38.620]  Why would you?
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.700]  You're gonna give it?
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.940]  Oh my god, this is crazy.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:44.960]  Nick, I'm gonna pick pink.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.180]  Okay, I like pink.
[01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.090]  I don't...
[01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:53.250]  I'm not participating in this part of it.
[01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:54.010]  I'm just playing the game.
[01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:56.910]  I don't...
[01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:59.970]  I don't want to be dealt any retribution.
[01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:04.370]  I'm just playing the game.
[01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:05.090]  Dale will remember this!
[01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:06.150]  Dale will remember this!
[01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:08.210]  That...
[01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:10.230]  That was the ickest I've felt
[01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:11.550]  playing Mario Party ever.
[01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.290]  That was the shadiest shit.
[01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:14.370]  Look...
[01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:19.250]  Look, when someone's been on an absolute pipe dream...
[01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:21.530]  I don't have the stars!
[01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.290]  I'm gonna end this with no stars!
[01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:24.550]  It's not gonna make a difference!
[01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:26.090]  What do you mean?
[01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:28.470]  You have, like, four stars.
[01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:30.490]  You have four stars! What are you talking about?
[01:31:30.630 --> 01:31:31.470]  You have three.
[01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:35.450]  Geoff has three. He's got 49 more coins.
[01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:36.350]  Okay.
[01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:38.630]  I'm not gonna be able to use these pipes
[01:31:38.630 --> 01:31:39.890]  and the turns we have.
[01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:41.690]  I am not a threat here.
[01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:42.890]  I am not the number one threat.
[01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:45.410]  Well, you're not a threat now because of what we did.
[01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.070]  I wasn't a threat before that! I don't have the money!
[01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:49.890]  You would've had the money!
[01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.850]  No, I wouldn't have!
[01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:53.790]  I would still need, like, 20 more!
[01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.830]  One more star!
[01:31:55.230 --> 01:31:56.550]  You would've pulled the star with the pipe!
[01:31:56.690 --> 01:31:58.870]  No matter what, I'm getting one more star.
[01:31:59.510 --> 01:32:02.050]  I could only buy one more star no matter what happened.
[01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:03.310]  That's terrible.
[01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:05.870]  I'm not gonna let that happen, I assure you.
[01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:08.690]  Uh...
[01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:08.950]  Uh...
[01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:10.890]  I'm fucking one short.
[01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:13.390]  I figured I could get there on my own.
[01:32:14.150 --> 01:32:14.530]  Oh!
[01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:16.930]  What's the luck thing?
[01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:19.210]  The bad luck thing.
[01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:20.090]  Yeah.
[01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:22.950]  It's being paired with you two fucks in a minigame.
[01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:27.390]  To be fair, I felt really bad.
[01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:28.870]  I don't care, you should!
[01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:31.810]  You should be terrible!
[01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:32.670]  I mean, also, you're in the lead.
[01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:33.590]  So...
[01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:35.050]  I don't feel bad anymore.
[01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:39.170]  I don't feel bad anymore?
[01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:41.430]  Yeah, I thought about it and I'm over it.
[01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:42.410]  What'd you get, Geoff?
[01:32:43.290 --> 01:32:44.530]  Geoff, that's not enough turns!
[01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.350]  Geoff!
[01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.670]  Just...
[01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:49.850]  What's going on?
[01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:50.670]  Geoff, why?
[01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:52.850]  I just wanted it, I liked it.
[01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:55.670]  I mean, there is a shopping star, so maybe you'll get that.
[01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:56.510]  Oh, yeah, maybe.
[01:32:57.290 --> 01:32:59.390]  Give one item to the last place player?
[01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.930]  Oh!
[01:33:00.230 --> 01:33:00.910]  Another one?
[01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:04.250]  Interesting!
[01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:06.970]  Wow, look who's the big threat!
[01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:10.250]  He's not! He still only can finish with three!
[01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:12.750]  Well, that sucked.
[01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:16.750]  That was so funny!
[01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:19.390]  It doesn't mean anything. Okay, I can't use Boo.
[01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:20.750]  Yeah, you can.
[01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:21.410]  You have to use one of these.
[01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:24.410]  Boo's 50!
[01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.710]  What?
[01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:29.150]  Wait, is this 50?
[01:33:29.190 --> 01:33:31.050]  To steal a star, Boo is 50, yes.
[01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:33.590]  No, but you can steal coins from Geoff.
[01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:34.930]  Oh, cool, coins!
[01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:37.530]  Oh, great, coins, that's gonna help the one-star Gavin.
[01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:38.310]  It's just two turns left!
[01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:40.090]  That's fair, that's fair.
[01:33:41.670 --> 01:33:42.590]  I don't understand!
[01:33:42.710 --> 01:33:44.510]  He has one star, you have four!
[01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:46.070]  Yeah, but I'm not gonna win any of the bonus stars.
[01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:47.990]  There's like three bonus stars they give out.
[01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:49.470]  I'm not winning any of those.
[01:33:50.410 --> 01:33:52.850]  Andrew's trying to pitch you trickle-down economics right now.
[01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:55.870]  I'm explaining how this game is gonna work.
[01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:03.870]  Gavin is gonna win because of the bonus stars.
[01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:05.230]  That's what he's getting here.
[01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:07.590]  You don't know which bonus star he's gonna pick.
[01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:08.650]  I haven't done anything this game.
[01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:11.010]  It's gonna be the most happening, and you're gonna fuck-
[01:34:11.010 --> 01:34:13.490]  I'm telling you, Gavin's gonna get these bonus stars.
[01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:16.750]  I can't even afford the next star.
[01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:18.830]  Oh, I know what that's like!
[01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:22.030]  Oh, actually, I fucked myself out of a star.
[01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.470]  Whoops.
[01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:28.050]  He only has 13 coins, and he would've had enough if he won the game.
[01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:29.870]  Yeah, but it was worth the risk.
[01:34:30.230 --> 01:34:30.850]  No, it's not!
[01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:32.730]  Gavin's gonna win!
[01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:34.350]  No, he's not!
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.240]  I can't wait for Gavin to win.
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:45.000]  If he does win, I will be mad.
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.800]  I won't be! Get ready!
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:48.320]  Get ready, Nick!
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.320]  Nose treasure? What did he call me?
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.100]  What did he say?
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.320]  I'm trying to legalize that.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.200]  Betrayal.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.200]  Oh, if he's in the chest,
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.360]  he's gonna steal.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:07.760]  Oh, this is good.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.500]  You don't want any of this.
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.260]  What's that Bowser button?
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:14.480]  What if you just kick them all into the sea?
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.300]  Get the Bowser button.
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:17.120]  I wanna know what that is.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.460]  Do I want the Bowser button?
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:20.560]  Yeah, get it!
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.140]  What could it hurt?
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:25.600]  I wanna know what it is.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.260]  Call an imposter Bowser on an opponent.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.280]  Whoa, what does that do?
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.060]  Do it on Nick.
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.120]  Is this like a gammy Bowser?
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.680]  I needed the coin from the space and I didn't get one.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:35.140]  I suck.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.320]  I landed on a green like an idiot.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.580]  Alright, Dilkong time.
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:43.840]  Dilkong for the win.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:53.160]  You don't have enough.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.620]  I was thinking about what I wanted to do.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.300]  I think you wanna kick the shit out of me and get it.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.720]  I think you wanna land on a chance time.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:07.860]  What's going on in here?
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:10.420]  Interesting.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.280]  Uh oh, hang on.
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.120]  Oh no.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.540]  Oh, the tides, okay.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.880]  You hit the tide button.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.080]  Oh, balls!
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:28.380]  No, the chance!
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:29.140]  No!
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.360]  No chance time.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:32.580]  Oh no.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.480]  I'm back where I was!
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.480]  Geoff, you can get a chance time.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.880]  You can get a chance time, Geoff.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.100]  I believe in you.
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:49.720]  Custom block.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:56.220]  Alright, let's see where we're going.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:36:59.400]  Sweet.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:02.420]  Just did a perfect circle.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.720]  That's great.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.820]  That'll help me never.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:12.920]  Minigame.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.260]  Better than six though.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.760]  Oh, interesting.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.940]  Get me away from these fucks.
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:22.680]  Geoff is still eating.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.780]  Geoff's been eating for like the last 15 minutes.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.040]  I just had one gummy bear.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:31.640]  What do you say, Nick?
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.260]  Andrew, I think we need to stop Gavin.
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.740]  Oh my god.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.700]  I'm not throwing a game.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:38.060]  Hmm.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:39.080]  Okay.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.680]  Nick, what are you talking about?
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:43.760]  What are you talking about?
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.440]  You have a gold pipe still.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.260]  And if you win this,
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:49.220]  you'll have enough money.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.660]  Gavin, any time?
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.900]  I'm just at my controller.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.620]  Oh, come on!
[01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.410]  What is happening?
[01:38:19.670 --> 01:38:19.830]  Go!
[01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:25.790]  Whoops, I'm confused.
[01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:27.950]  What's the confusion?
[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:31.030]  Oh, I get it.
[01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:33.710]  This is...
[01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:35.650]  This is insane.
[01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:44.050]  I just...
[01:38:44.050 --> 01:38:46.050]  I don't even...
[01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:53.110]  I didn't...
[01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:54.850]  You can't even blame me.
[01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:56.610]  You cannot even blame me.
[01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:02.350]  Gavin screwed himself up.
[01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:06.010]  Put the square block in the square hole.
[01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:09.070]  I'm the square.
[01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:11.930]  My controller disconnected in practice
[01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:13.610]  because it threw the rules for me.
[01:39:16.890 --> 01:39:17.290]  Okay.
[01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:19.190]  Well.
[01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:21.230]  Well.
[01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:23.950]  Geoff, what do you need
[01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:24.710]  to land on chance time?
[01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:26.690]  Where's the chance tile?
[01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:29.750]  He's stuck in the circle.
[01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:31.730]  Yeah, there's one above him.
[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:33.810]  Do you see a chance tile in front of you?
[01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.750]  I don't think there is.
[01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:37.370]  It's the green with the two arrows.
[01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:39.990]  There should be one right in front of DK.
[01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:41.290]  How many away is it?
[01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:42.210]  Five.
[01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:44.750]  Do it, Geoff!
[01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:46.070]  Have I not noticed?
[01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:50.590]  Do it, Geoff.
[01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:52.450]  Send this out in style.
[01:39:52.530 --> 01:39:54.790]  What a phenomenal final turn if this is a...
[01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.810]  If you're right.
[01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:58.530]  If this is a Dilkon thrower.
[01:40:01.390 --> 01:40:01.850]  Okay.
[01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.510]  You just pick five.
[01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:05.590]  Okay.
[01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:08.810]  You gotta pick the block.
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:10.250]  Go back, go back!
[01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:12.930]  Pick the item.
[01:40:16.330 --> 01:40:16.850]  Okay.
[01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:21.010]  Now pick five.
[01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:23.670]  Excellent.
[01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:27.890]  There it is. Shit.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:29.030]  Well.
[01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:32.510]  Alright, Geoff. It's up to you.
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.510]  I've been playing this like an honorable man.
[01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:36.370]  Hopefully that gets rewarded.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:41.980]  Alright.
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:42.640]  We'll see.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.520]  The Dil is nothing but honorable.
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:51.400]  Please. Not me.
[01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.660]  Me. Me.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.020]  This is just crazy.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.420]  You know what, Gavin?
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.860]  Thank you so much
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.320]  for recommending I do that.
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:09.000]  I would've never thought to even
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.940]  attempt to go for it.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.260]  But it was your
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.320]  nudging that put me there.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:15.900]  Unbelievable.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:21.340]  Alright, so I can't use either of these
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.180]  gold pipes.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:24.460]  So...
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.360]  Where are they in reference to
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:27.720]  chances?
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.080]  That's a good point.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.060]  That's a good little point hole.
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.500]  Let's go on the board.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.400]  It would put me over here.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.380]  So I'd have to roll a...
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.800]  Okay, what is...
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.740]  Good lord, how do you...
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.980]  I have to drive around the whole map to see...
[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.820]  Are you okay?
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:50.260]  Yeah, chill out.
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.120]  I need to buy...
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.180]  1, 2, 3, 4.
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.160]  I would need a 4 or a...
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.500]  1, 2, 3, 4, 8.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:41:59.940]  Yeah, you chill out, Eric.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:01.340]  Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.140]  I'm gonna chill.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:04.840]  Gavin, I believe in you.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.960]  Or, I could use the Bowser walkie-talkie
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.060]  and see what the hell that is.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.180]  Yeah, Bowser walkie-talkie.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:13.420]  Seems good.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:15.300]  Bowser walkie-talkie would be pretty fun.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:17.620]  As long as you don't
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.120]  put it on me.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.520]  Wait, you want it on you?
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.780]  No, I said as long as you don't put it on me.
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:24.660]  Oh, sorry.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.140]  Use it on Geoff, because he's first.
[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.700]  Why me? What did I do?
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:29.660]  You're in the lead.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:32.360]  I'm not smart enough to win. You don't have to worry about it.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.280]  I'll do something dumb.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.300]  We'll let Impostor Bowser
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:39.220]  on our payment. He's not gonna do anything
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.160]  though, surely. And if I call it on
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.080]  Geoff, nothing will happen because he's
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:43.600]  already been.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:47.000]  It has to do something
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.160]  or else it wouldn't be in this game.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.220]  Geoff's already gone this turn.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.460]  This is the last turn.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.860]  No, don't use it on me.
[01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:56.980]  Hold on, let me see what it does.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:58.640]  If I go on the gold,
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.860]  if I use the gold, I can roll a 4 or 8, which is...
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.420]  I'm just gonna use this.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.580]  The chat seems to want it to go on Andrew.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.300]  If there's a random, put it on random.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:08.340]  Hi, Eric.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.140]  Okay, hang on. Alright, okay.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:12.900]  Hey, I'm on the phone with my boy.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.900]  Yep. Send Bowser to another player
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:16.620]  starting up a Bowser event. Okay.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.300]  Well, what happened?
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:21.920]  Oh.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.200]  Oh god.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.260]  My controller.
[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:30.220]  So you didn't even get a pick, it just does it.
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:31.060]  Wow.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.980]  Really? And it picked you?
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.000]  No! Again!
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.240]  Oh, thanks for the sub,
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:38.680]  really good.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.520]  This is crazy.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.920]  Oh my god.
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.880]  You could take his coins and he won't be able to buy
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.880]  another star. Or he could do communism.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.320]  Or he could do communism.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.180]  Oh!
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.000]  Oh!
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:57.740]  Oh!
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:43:59.140]  Oh!
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.000]  Oh!
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:09.240]  He'll buy it back, but oh my god.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.900]  Oh man!
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.720]  Dilkong!
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.180]  Dilkong will remember this.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.300]  Oh!
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:20.000]  I like the Bowser phone.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.640]  Dil has a long memory.
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.280]  Why would I use the Bowser phone?
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.600]  It won't do nothing in it!
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:27.140]  It won't do nothing in it!
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.120]  Erickson use it! Erickson use it!
[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.940]  I said use it on Nick.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:33.960]  Gavin was like, why would I use it?
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.360]  I'm like, nothing will happen!
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.380]  Go Wario, go!
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:38.300]  Nine!
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:43.540]  Oh!
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.580]  Oh, you could stop him!
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.860]  You could stop him from getting the...
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.820]  I have less than Geoff now!
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.140]  Like, best case scenario, I have
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.160]  equal to Geoff and less coins than him.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.400]  No, but I feel so bad about the
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.420]  stars deal. Then take it from Geoff.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.180]  Or me, whatever.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.760]  Take it from anybody else other than Geoff.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.180]  You should take it from Geoff.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.180]  Do it at random. Are you fucking serious?
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.020]  Oh, I feel bad!
[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.040]  Oh my god!
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:13.220]  This is the craziest!
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.140]  The West is Western!
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:18.080]  It is so wild!
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.320]  Oh my god!
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.680]  Shut the fucking fire!
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.120]  Oh my god!
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.120]  Dude, this is insane!
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:37.820]  I can't believe this!
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.920]  I can't believe that!
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:51.800]  Andrew, you could go on the
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.740]  pipe and maybe get a chance.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:54.320]  Shut the fuck up!
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:55.640]  Shut up!
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:08.180]  Oh my god!
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.040]  Oh shit!
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.400]  He got ten coins, man!
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:26.080]  Oh man!
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:26.780]  I gotta say,
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.320]  having all those golden pipes is a real target.
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.200]  Oh man, Gongy's right!
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.760]  This is a group of things to remember.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:36.620]  Everybody gets dangerous.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:41.460]  Oh, it's a crane game.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.140]  This stream took a real turn for Andrew being there.
[01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:49.680]  Oh my god! Oh, he got me instantly!
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:50.820]  He's got his own blood!
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.240]  Mario Party March
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.140]  is about to be insane.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.840]  It's going to be a vile month.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:59.240]  You have to hope that
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:00.240]  we have short memories.
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:02.640]  Oh, we don't.
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.120]  We don't.
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.080]  Oh my god!
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:10.980]  He got Gavin!
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.460]  Get used to that!
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.140]  No!
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.740]  Grumple Tynesday Massacre!
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.260]  Geoff, this is all on you!
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.900]  Geoff, you can do it!
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.420]  Just keep running!
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.260]  Run past him!
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.540]  You just got to last 15 seconds.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:30.360]  You can hold!
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.900]  15 seconds is a long time.
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.260]  He's dead.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.140]  He didn't even move.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:38.680]  I tried to zoom past him and
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.380]  zig right, but he got it.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.060]  It's going to be a rough march for us.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.840]  We got it on the calendar.
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.060]  I put it 30 repeating events.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.040]  Let's see how we did.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:54.220]  Oh god.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.500]  Here it is, boys!
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:59.420]  The end of Grumple Tynes Mario Party.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.440]  Let's see where we land.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.840]  It's anybody's game.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.860]  Great job on everybody who's internet connection was good.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.640]  Hey, you know what?
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:07.280]  Great job.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:10.020]  How's your decorative cable?
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:11.580]  It's great.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.120]  We got the job done.
[01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:19.410]  That was fun.
[01:48:19.570 --> 01:48:20.230]  Yeah, it was a good time.
[01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:26.670]  Oh my god.
[01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:29.530]  So, the first bonus is...
[01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:30.690]  Shopping!
[01:48:32.010 --> 01:48:33.390]  Andrew did a lot of shopping.
[01:48:34.130 --> 01:48:34.770]  Oh!
[01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:36.350]  That's a tie!
[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:38.470]  My god.
[01:48:38.690 --> 01:48:40.910]  How about that, Andrew?
[01:48:41.230 --> 01:48:42.490]  Extra stars.
[01:48:43.390 --> 01:48:44.030]  Yes!
[01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:46.270]  This has to be me!
[01:48:46.630 --> 01:48:47.830]  This has to be!
[01:48:48.130 --> 01:48:48.390]  Yeah!
[01:48:51.670 --> 01:48:52.450]  It's coming!
