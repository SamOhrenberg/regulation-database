[00:00.000 --> 00:06.460]  Most of our streams are... they sound a bit better, but we're the foreigners left over
[00:06.460 --> 00:09.700]  on a holiday, so no one else is around.
[00:11.220 --> 00:17.580]  Everybody is doing turkey stuff, I guess. I don't know. I worked through my turkey day,
[00:17.660 --> 00:21.280]  Gavin. What about you? Is there Thanksgiving in the UK?
[00:22.100 --> 00:22.860]  No. God no.
[00:23.640 --> 00:25.240]  God no? Yeah, I didn't think so.
[00:25.240 --> 00:32.620]  It was just a Thursday to me, but my wife celebrates Thanksgiving, so we did have a meal.
[00:32.680 --> 00:37.700]  It's interesting that Canada has a Thanksgiving and that you don't. I just assumed, you know...
[00:38.500 --> 00:40.580]  Here's what makes no sense about Thanksgiving, right?
[00:43.820 --> 00:50.540]  Everyone gets together less than three weeks before Christmas and eats Christmas food.
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.860]  You know what? This is a take I expect from a not food guy.
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.240]  This is such a not food guy opinion. What you're explaining, you're like, yeah,
[01:06.400 --> 01:11.280]  yeah, no, you're right, but isn't that great? It's one of the best meals. Christmas dinner
[01:11.280 --> 01:13.860]  and Thanksgiving dinner, two of the best meals of the year.
[01:15.720 --> 01:19.080]  Yeah, this is very close. It's like everyone goes to see their family,
[01:19.800 --> 01:24.160]  complains about their family, and then has to do it again in like a month.
[01:24.820 --> 01:26.920]  Holy shit, what map is this?
[01:28.180 --> 01:35.480]  I have no idea. We're doing doubles. I still do the weekly ultimate challenge every week in this
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.580]  game. You've never missed one. So it was Gavin. Never missed one. Why do I have no...
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.700]  Did you turn on your Twitch setting? I don't know. I have no idea. Is your audio being shared?
[01:47.700 --> 01:52.920]  Let's just redo what we just did. I'm holding the circle.
[01:54.660 --> 02:02.500]  Nuts. Whose field of view is nuts? Mine is. I think maybe I was recording backgrounds and I
[02:02.500 --> 02:10.400]  turned off my... That makes sense. It's all adding up. Well, as soon as you get your backgrounds
[02:10.400 --> 02:19.000]  figured out... Oh, you back in? Yeah. Shit. Okay, circle's open. Square. It's not a circle. What am
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.740]  I talking about? How embarrassing. It used to be a circle, right? For King of the Hill? It was always
[02:24.740 --> 02:36.780]  a circle? I think it was various shapes. Or did it switch? Yeah. They're about to score, Gavin.
[02:37.740 --> 02:41.260]  Okay. Gavin. They're about to score.
[02:43.880 --> 02:51.600]  Ah, shit. I regret diving into both of them. Let's group up. Let's group up. Yeah. Well,
[02:51.620 --> 02:56.140]  let's... Maybe you want to head over there and I'll be right there. I'll join you. Okay. Swapping
[02:56.140 --> 03:01.480]  this. Okay. I see them. They're in the back. It looks like I'm throwing some grenades. Okay. One
[03:01.480 --> 03:12.860]  down. Okay. Nice work. Took out Jimmy's legs. Not Jimmy's legs. He needs those.
[03:15.500 --> 03:18.260]  Jimmy's legs got stuck in the bottom of a well.
[03:19.180 --> 03:22.980]  Oh, shit. Grenade. Yeah. I don't know where that's from. Diagonal, maybe?
[03:25.340 --> 03:30.900]  Oh. Oh, I got hit from the side. Grenade. Oh, he got you too. Jimmy's legs with a vengeance.
[03:30.900 --> 03:37.620]  The other guy got me. Damn. Both his legs. Two kills. Two legs.
[03:39.040 --> 03:43.700]  Okay. Uh, I spawned right next to it. I don't know where you're at. Ah, they got over shield.
[03:46.680 --> 03:50.640]  You gonna work on... Oh, okay. Oh, good shots. Oh, shit.
[03:51.560 --> 03:56.840]  Am I just monster chief? What's my... I don't know. It's every... All of my game's all different.
[03:58.600 --> 04:02.020]  I should be blue. Let me see.
[04:04.660 --> 04:09.160]  I'm dressed as the... Oh, yeah. You're just master chief on my screen. I don't know what you did.
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.120]  Did you just die? I did. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. I'm trying to avenge you,
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.960]  but I missed every shot. So, don't you worry. It's gonna look great. Oh, boy. That was bad.
[04:24.100 --> 04:29.700]  They're just killing us one at a time. Should we go? Yeah. Yeah, we'll sync back up. Yeah.
[04:30.540 --> 04:34.000]  Okay, I'm with you. Oh, they have to come to us now.
[04:36.880 --> 04:44.220]  Okay, I'm taking the hill. They're throwing grenades left and right. I'm just recharging my shield.
[04:45.920 --> 04:49.920]  What the goddamn? Did he come behind me? We're both dead. Oh, he just shot us both.
[04:50.360 --> 04:54.700]  Enemy team. Yeah, he killed both of us. I missed a bunch of shots again. It was awesome,
[04:55.940 --> 05:02.260]  but I'm with you. Okay. You want to just go head on or what do you want to do?
[05:03.660 --> 05:09.680]  Yeah. They're not even in the thing anymore. Okay, I threw a bomb thing.
[05:10.460 --> 05:14.400]  Pushing him. Pushing him. Pushing him. Okay, one's down. I'm weak. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
[05:14.400 --> 05:22.560]  he's weak. He's weak. Nice. Hell yeah. I'm alone. Help. Help. I'm watching you. I'm spawning in one
[05:22.560 --> 05:28.980]  second. I'm on my way. I'm totally freaking out. I'm with you. Okay, they got an overshield. They're
[05:28.980 --> 05:39.560]  gonna use it, unfortunately. Yeah, he's popping it right now. Oh, shit. Oh, boy. We, I feel like,
[05:39.560 --> 05:45.160]  did nothing to either of them. That was really not great. They're really good at killing us
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.180]  as one. They just bashed us to pieces together because we were clumped up.
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.900]  Yeah. Look, we're warming up. I'm gonna go left. I'm going left. Yeah, this is the first game.
[05:55.960 --> 06:00.660]  We gotta get the rest off. We gotta go all the way until 5.01 or maybe like 5.11 after all the
[06:00.660 --> 06:05.760]  not playing we did. Oh, you've gone.
[06:07.580 --> 06:14.020]  I have. Yeah. I brought a gun specifically to deal with their overshield guide. It missed
[06:14.020 --> 06:21.020]  every shot. Did not land. Okay, well, we're already, we lost, but let's see how close we
[06:21.020 --> 06:26.820]  are to completing some of the challenges for me for this week. Did we make any progress?
[06:32.410 --> 06:33.410]  Great journey.
[06:35.370 --> 06:41.390]  Play any match. Yeah, I played a match season. Yeah, I need to play one more and then I've
[06:41.390 --> 06:49.230]  completed one of those. Let's do a quick look at what I need. I need win a game, complete a game,
[06:49.450 --> 06:57.190]  earn a killing spree, win three games. You need to win three games? A lot. Yeah. We can win three
[06:57.190 --> 07:05.090]  games? Three games within this stream? Not if they go like that. Let me pick my, uh, Emil guy.
[07:06.150 --> 07:22.900]  Okay. Equip. I would swap out of that dishcloth bandit. Dishcloth bandit saying one of my
[07:22.900 --> 07:29.200]  challenges is eat the pencil. I'd use one of my swaps on that one. You've been using swap on that
[07:29.200 --> 07:33.780]  every week since the game came out. I have been. Yeah, I'm running out of swaps. It's a problem.
[07:34.480 --> 07:42.690]  I got like one left. What the hell is this back? It's called prism.
[07:46.050 --> 07:49.070]  Very prismatic. Oh, my old skin's back.
[07:51.210 --> 07:56.390]  Oh, and you got a little halo on your head? Yeah. I got halo around my feet.
[07:58.130 --> 08:00.350]  We could sync up. We just need a chess guy.
[08:01.590 --> 08:05.770]  Oh, fuck. King of the Hill again. I feel like this is not going to be a game type that we'll be good
[08:05.770 --> 08:11.690]  at. I freaking hate King of the Hill. You know that? Oh, wow. I'm vanilla. So am I. Oh, it's
[08:11.690 --> 08:19.110]  Jimmy's legs again. Oh, it's Jimmy's legs again. Same two people. Jimmy's legs must be so excited.
[08:20.590 --> 08:24.870]  It's like the easiest win of all time. Again, I'm going for the energy sword.
[08:27.880 --> 08:30.640]  I'm pushing for it. OK, that didn't work.
[08:33.300 --> 08:36.800]  Maybe we need to push them because they're about. OK, you're dead.
[08:39.060 --> 08:42.200]  OK, I'm going for it. Enemy about to score.
[08:47.060 --> 08:54.220]  You've just joined this stream. It's the non-Americans remaining over from the holiday
[08:56.300 --> 08:58.920]  streaming with an average performance in Halo.
[09:00.700 --> 09:04.980]  Well, listen, we're dealing with Jimmy's legs. Oh, I'm me. I'm me over there. Great.
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.890]  I'm going to flank. OK. Die, Jimmy's legs. Nice. Oh, behind me. Behind me.
[09:12.760 --> 09:17.300]  Oh, shit. Shit. And they got the sword. That's a real problem. Please don't notice.
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.020]  I'm just running as fast as I can and hope they're going to get it. Fuck.
[09:26.140 --> 09:34.280]  OK, he's down one above Jimmy's legs above. Yeah, he's no shields. I'm going to flank. Son of a bitch.
[09:41.800 --> 09:45.280]  Oh, I'm going to. Oh, the sword's here. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.
[09:47.940 --> 09:52.960]  Did you get a nice teamwork? Yeah, I grabbed it. Nice. All right. Get on that. Oh, shit.
[09:53.500 --> 09:56.620]  Oh, shit. OK, well, I got it. Be a little jet piece.
[09:58.520 --> 10:04.020]  Both of them coming in from that same side. I don't like it. Oh, it's so far away. Holy shit.
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.380]  I'm running over. I'm just I'm hiding. I'm running away in a little coward.
[10:10.820 --> 10:19.360]  Enemy team took the hill. And then we're going. Nice. Oh, fuck. Where was that? That's what I was
[10:19.360 --> 10:24.420]  always invisible. Jimmy, Jimmy's invisible. Jimmy got a nice needles. OK, there should be a sword
[10:24.420 --> 10:31.140]  there. Yeah. Good job. I need help. OK, I need help pushing. I'm on my way right next to you.
[10:31.500 --> 10:40.500]  It's a powerful needle. Is this the like the I think it's the one? Yeah. Oh, wow. OK, very nice.
[10:40.560 --> 10:48.820]  Very strong. Now he's weak, he's weak. Nice finish. Oh, I got that from my dead body cam.
[10:48.820 --> 10:55.080]  That was awesome to score. Well, we might have this one. I think so. I think we suddenly learned
[10:55.080 --> 11:03.340]  how to play in their eyes. Available. Hell, yeah. Didn't do that last time. All right. What's this
[11:03.340 --> 11:10.840]  weapon up here? Needler. Oh, he's behind me. Oh, he he harpoon me or hit me or something.
[11:16.110 --> 11:20.730]  I'm respawning. I'm going to get the energy sword again. OK.
[11:25.110 --> 11:26.430]  Oh, give it to me.
[11:28.650 --> 11:31.350]  How's it going over there? Shit ass. I dropped the sword.
[11:39.270 --> 11:42.410]  Not if I have anything to say about it. I'm coming.
[11:44.030 --> 11:47.930]  Oh, no. They're both dead. They're both dead. I'm running in. The sword is there.
[11:47.930 --> 11:50.830]  Take the sword and hold the point and I'll be back in two seconds.
[11:53.510 --> 11:55.190]  Where's the dead sword at? Oh, I'm so far away.
[11:59.540 --> 12:00.780]  Oh, chip me in his legs.
[12:04.060 --> 12:06.260]  Help. I'm trying. I'm trying.
[12:10.340 --> 12:13.620]  We got an invisible guy somewhere. It's freaking me out. I don't like it.
[12:13.840 --> 12:20.620]  Preda. Where? Got him. Oh, nice. Good job, Gavin. Oh, that was awesome.
[12:22.380 --> 12:25.040]  OK. Oh, right, right.
[12:30.450 --> 12:32.430]  OK, one's down, one's pushing up.
[12:35.510 --> 12:39.230]  Oh, you got this. I'm watching. You got this. Nice.
[12:42.090 --> 12:46.930]  I found Jimmy's weak spot. It's his legs. Yeah. Who could have guessed?
[12:48.390 --> 12:52.970]  Oh, hell yeah. OK, we got two of them. They're at the skewer.
[12:53.090 --> 12:56.590]  Yeah, they are. I'm going to come around to you.
[12:59.850 --> 13:04.150]  OK, well, I'd needle them, but he blasted me. We got to get you these wins.
[13:05.630 --> 13:10.750]  1v1. Yeah, I mean, I struggle with the wins, to be honest. Nice.
[13:12.870 --> 13:18.890]  OK, I need help. I'm away. Yeah, coming. I'm not. Oh, wait, they quit.
[13:19.350 --> 13:27.850]  We got them to surrender. Jimmy's leg surrendered. His legs gave out. Take that, Jimmy's legs.
[13:31.130 --> 13:36.170]  I can't believe that they kicked our ass in the first game and they retreated in the second.
[13:37.030 --> 13:44.490]  We just remembered how to play. Yeah. And what I am going to remember is to pop a double XP boost
[13:44.490 --> 13:52.070]  because I always forget. Oh, do I have one of those, do you think? Probably. Oh, I got a key
[13:52.070 --> 13:57.610]  chain. What can I put that on my halo keys for you to back up? Yeah, your halo keys. So you don't
[13:57.610 --> 14:11.710]  forget them at home. Ever fire your keys, prime your keys, use XP boost. Oh, sick. Fuck. Why is
[14:11.710 --> 14:17.570]  it? Oh, my God. Now I'm in the multiplayer. Where am I? Jesus Christ. It won't let me use it. Why
[14:17.570 --> 14:27.550]  wouldn't let me use it? Oh, because I can't get any more XP. You got max XP. Yeah, I have the
[14:27.550 --> 14:35.550]  highest XP on all of Halo Infinite. Well, no, because they added like a level XP bar way later,
[14:35.810 --> 14:39.770]  but I don't have any battle passes I can put XP into, so I don't think it will let me.
[14:39.770 --> 14:47.990]  I have a question for chat. Has anyone got any wicked Black Friday slash whatever the whole
[14:47.990 --> 14:54.910]  week is called deals? That's a great question. It seems like Black Friday is like two weeks long
[14:54.910 --> 15:00.750]  these days. It is. Yeah, I woke up this morning. I was like, oh, Black Friday. And they realized,
[15:00.870 --> 15:06.490]  oh, this is just everything that's been here for a week. Nothing is different. Yeah. And all the
[15:06.490 --> 15:13.250]  stuff is like barely it's like the same price anyway. Yeah, especially living in a foreign
[15:13.250 --> 15:21.310]  market. And you have to like factor in shipping and it's yeah. I thought about buying some DVDs,
[15:21.310 --> 15:25.450]  but then I realized that because of how I set up my Xbox through the capture,
[15:25.630 --> 15:32.410]  I just can't play anything. It blocks me from watching anything. HDCP, baby. Yeah, it's annoying.
[15:33.090 --> 15:39.970]  Yeah, I got one. Jimmy's legs. He's got a quick and Jimmy's legs. Oh, you guys going to cower?
[15:41.090 --> 15:43.790]  Better leave now. This is our game type behind us.
[15:47.390 --> 15:49.890]  They're going to beat us by 50 points after I say that.
[15:51.270 --> 15:56.530]  I need to kill these three. OK, I've got three so far. I'll just try and weaken them.
[15:57.390 --> 15:59.930]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, he's weak. He's weak.
[16:03.640 --> 16:08.340]  OK, did you die? I was scared. No, I ran away. Oh, OK. Oh, God.
[16:12.760 --> 16:19.740]  Oh, OK. One more. I need one more. A 55 inch TV for $200. That's nuts.
[16:21.260 --> 16:24.080]  Is it like 30 frames? You should get a three pack.
[16:27.500 --> 16:30.160]  Has anyone ever bought two TVs at the same time?
[16:33.480 --> 16:36.460]  That'd be a such a. Oh, they're both to the left. They're both to the left.
[16:44.260 --> 16:49.140]  I'm trying something risky. I'm distracting them. Get him. Get him.
[16:49.380 --> 16:52.880]  Got him. Got him. Nice. All right. The other guy's in there. Why wasn't that a killing spree?
[16:53.140 --> 16:59.880]  Why wasn't that a killing spree? I can't count. I can't count. I had four. Oh,
[17:01.320 --> 17:03.820]  oh, we're starting over. Start the count over.
[17:06.060 --> 17:13.300]  On the board. Wow. Ghost Fluffbutt has bought two TVs at the same time before. What size?
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.360]  I mean, please let me know. Unless you got a giant room, that's going to surely going to be small
[17:20.360 --> 17:28.780]  ones. Just instead of painting my walls, I've bought four TVs. TVs can be wallpaper. Yeah.
[17:29.800 --> 17:34.880]  Those fancy framed ones. It's just art. You got four giant things of art on your wall.
[17:35.200 --> 17:38.220]  It's art when it's off and it's a survivor when it's on.
[17:39.860 --> 17:46.720]  Whoa. You blew my grenades. I blew your grenades? Yeah. You kind of like winged them.
[17:48.440 --> 17:56.360]  Oh, no. I need help. OK, got him. Got him. Got him. Nice. That's two. Oh,
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.060]  that needler's a problem. Kill him. I've weakened him. I got him. I got him. I got him. Three. Thank
[18:01.060 --> 18:10.280]  you. Oh, he's back. He's back. He's back. Four. Nice. OK. Oh, I'm really low health.
[18:10.640 --> 18:18.040]  It's weird to stop shooting deliberately at the pivotal moment. Yeah. I just need one more.
[18:20.900 --> 18:27.600]  Where are they? They're probably. Oh, I see him over there. Oh, yeah. They're pushing the cinder.
[18:28.220 --> 18:33.820]  Wow. That wall didn't work. Oh, that's really bad for you. My head was poking above it.
[18:36.640 --> 18:43.560]  Are you going for it? You know you want it. Get into Swift, he says. It's infinite campaign.
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.020]  And you get. I really liked it, actually. I. Yeah, I thought. I recommend it. It felt
[18:48.020 --> 18:54.900]  uh. If you like Halo one where it's like just you and Cortana, basically, that was the vibes I got.
[18:56.240 --> 19:03.240]  Where are they? They're over there. Let me pass them off. One's over there.
[19:06.880 --> 19:12.020]  He's hurt. Got him. Got him. Got him. Got him. Yeah. Kills free. Thanks, Gavin.
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.920]  Oh, good teamwork. Thank you so much. Those ones are also really annoying to get.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.180]  OK.
[19:22.540 --> 19:24.480]  Twelve to five. I like the run we're on.
[19:27.460 --> 19:31.440]  I wonder if Jimmy's legs hasn't quit because he thinks we'll just get matched up again.
[19:31.680 --> 19:34.880]  So what's the point? We might push him into a different playlist.
[19:35.460 --> 19:38.620]  He's one of the three people playing Halo Infinite. Yeah.
[19:41.760 --> 19:44.140]  Do you ever struggle to find games when you're going for your challenges?
[19:45.300 --> 19:49.740]  Uh, sometimes it takes a little while, depending on what playlist I'm doing and what time of day
[19:49.740 --> 19:55.380]  I'm playing. Interesting. But I find them eventually. It is weird to be like, this is
[19:55.380 --> 20:00.880]  the most recent Halo. On and off I play Master Chief Collection and I never struggle for games
[20:00.880 --> 20:16.860]  in that. Yeah. Well, we uh, we played this quite a bit when it came out and then a lot of people,
[20:16.860 --> 20:23.320]  I think, bounced off of it and then they've continually upgraded it and like fix things
[20:23.320 --> 20:29.040]  slowly. But it just hasn't, unfortunately, I think ever got the momentum back that it had at launch.
[20:29.660 --> 20:34.680]  I would be up for playing it again. I never like got bored of it. I just
[20:34.680 --> 20:38.120]  maxed out my thing on the first season. Sure.
[20:38.620 --> 20:39.060]  Oops.
[20:42.260 --> 20:45.760]  Now they do, they don't even do like full 100 level seasons anymore.
[20:46.140 --> 20:49.840]  They do like these 20 level operations. Right. Every few weeks.
[20:51.280 --> 20:55.080]  Robin Yutani, Gav, have you met the Halo announcer? I did meet him once,
[20:56.400 --> 21:01.760]  Geoff Steitzer, and he was very nice. I took a picture with him. He seems like he'd be lovely.
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.760]  At first he was confused that I recognized him.
[21:08.200 --> 21:11.360]  Yeah, he was like, wait, you want to get a picture with me? I was like,
[21:11.900 --> 21:16.700]  I play a lot of Halo. And he's like, oh, to the point where you know what I look like? That's
[21:16.700 --> 21:27.030]  crazy. Does he do any other voice work in games? I don't know. I think he's just an actor. It'd be
[21:27.030 --> 21:31.590]  really funny if you like approached him and was like, I love your work in Bubsy 2. I'm a big
[21:31.590 --> 21:37.090]  Bubsy 2 fan. I think you did some great stuff there. Does he ever get approached for anything
[21:37.090 --> 21:40.550]  outside of Halo? That'd be interesting to know.
[21:41.090 --> 21:46.190]  Originally, I just recognized his voice. I was like, that sounds just like the guy.
[21:48.570 --> 21:51.610]  And then I turned around and I saw his face. I was like, that's definitely the guy.
[21:52.550 --> 21:56.050]  The problem with Halo is that the terminology never would naturally come up.
[21:56.430 --> 22:00.190]  Like you would never be in a restaurant and overhear someone being like,
[22:00.190 --> 22:06.550]  so then he walked in and he said, double kill. And I said, killtrocity.
[22:07.990 --> 22:14.530]  Like it's, he has to be doing a Halo thing. Chaney mania. Yeah.
[22:17.350 --> 22:22.350]  Of all the, like the Halo medals, which one do you think is most applicable in day-to-day
[22:22.350 --> 22:26.570]  conversation? Without it being obvious that it's a Halo thing. Hell's janitor.
[22:31.070 --> 22:35.930]  Oh, you're ordering steaks for the table? Steak-tacular.
[22:41.320 --> 22:45.340]  Gavin, your internet is dropping or something. You keep sounding like a robot. I think it's...
[22:45.340 --> 22:49.340]  No, that's just how he sounds. It's just how I sound when I'm on an Xbox party chat.
[22:49.660 --> 22:53.500]  This isn't coming. You're not hearing me through Discord. So that's why I sound like shit.
[22:53.500 --> 22:59.600]  We're streaming because no one, no one is here that knows how to stream properly. We're streaming
[22:59.600 --> 23:08.620]  directly from Andrew's Xbox and I'm coming through party chat. So very apologies for that. But on the
[23:08.620 --> 23:15.400]  VOD it'll sound great on Tuesday. It's going to sound incredible. It's going to look great. It's
[23:15.400 --> 23:21.230]  going to be crazy how much better it is. Discord is integrated Xbox. I think it is, but you can't
[23:22.950 --> 23:27.610]  stream with my Discord audio or something. Is that what you're saying? I don't believe so. If
[23:27.610 --> 23:31.410]  I can, then that would be good to know for the future. But the way that it's phrased doesn't
[23:31.410 --> 23:40.070]  imply that it would work that way. Gavin, you had five cameras on your Pimble stream. This is true.
[23:45.690 --> 23:48.350]  I don't have any of the info to stream from this account.
[23:50.470 --> 23:56.470]  That is okay. That is an insane excuse for you not to be streaming. You have access to all that
[23:56.470 --> 24:04.290]  stuff. You just hadn't, haven't put it in. I should get that. You have it. It's there. No, I mean like,
[24:04.330 --> 24:10.970]  I, I, I should put it into my OBS. Yeah, you should get it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'd be a good idea.
[24:12.270 --> 24:17.890]  And then next Black Friday when, oh, Chibi's legs has got an overshield. Oh, I stuck him. Take that.
[24:17.890 --> 24:21.270]  Oh, it didn't kill him. It just broke his overshield. That's too bad.
[24:24.060 --> 24:27.340]  Oh, I just grenaded myself. I saw that.
[24:31.380 --> 24:35.600]  I love that we just keep getting Chibi's legs. Oh boy, I'm so dead.
[24:38.520 --> 24:43.160]  SkiNoodle86 really got me. Maybe I'll get an assassination.
[24:49.910 --> 24:55.110]  Do you get it? Yeah. Well, it's not an assassination. It's like a backsmack, isn't it?
[24:55.630 --> 25:01.790]  I love the, this bug where you just spin in the air. I'm dancing. I'm breakdancing.
[25:02.130 --> 25:04.630]  I feel like that's been in Halo since Halo 3 or Halo 2.
[25:06.590 --> 25:10.250]  Every time there's a new engine or something, they still somehow manage to get that in there.
[25:10.270 --> 25:10.770]  Yeah, it's the same.
[25:13.230 --> 25:16.670]  Also carried over to Slipspace. It's the Halo 2.
[25:17.550 --> 25:25.110]  Havoc bugs. Maybe it's like the Rumble pack. Was that the N64 thing you needed to play Donkey Kong
[25:25.110 --> 25:30.770]  64? The expansion pack? Yeah, the expansion pack where they didn't actually understand
[25:30.770 --> 25:38.270]  how the expansion pack fixed it. They just knew it worked. It's like, we don't know how to,
[25:38.490 --> 25:41.950]  we don't know how this keeps happening, but it just does. Something we're doing.
[25:41.950 --> 25:52.060]  All right, let's stick together. Screw back up. Yeah. I don't want to lose to Jimmy's legs again.
[25:53.460 --> 25:57.320]  No. After we beat him twice in a row, I'm going to go three times.
[25:58.120 --> 26:00.460]  Do you have any specific challenges you're trying to get in this game?
[26:01.440 --> 26:05.680]  I need to win it and I need a multi-kill, I believe.
[26:07.020 --> 26:15.720]  Oh no, he got me. Oh no. Okay. I'm going to wait for you. We're going to sync back up.
[26:16.920 --> 26:27.250]  We're going to turn the tide. Okay. He's shooting at you. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you.
[26:28.750 --> 26:29.570]  Oh, I killed myself.
[26:33.350 --> 26:36.450]  I just see a fire extinguisher that you popped shooting out.
[26:36.890 --> 26:38.790]  I think I got killed by a fire extinguisher.
[26:41.150 --> 26:49.290]  Gas to death by CO2. Okay. Grabbing this shotgun. All right, I'm going to start coming to you.
[26:50.350 --> 27:04.780]  Okay. Ah, fuck. Grenade. Do we want to adjust how we come at them? Because I feel like it's kind of,
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.880]  they kind of know. They kind of, yeah. Yeah, they know. Let's, here, let's go this way.
[27:09.880 --> 27:15.040]  Okay. Let's drop down. Oh. Oh shit.
[27:17.820 --> 27:23.880]  Got one. Nice. Yeah. Where's the other? He'll probably poke his head maybe up here.
[27:26.920 --> 27:34.340]  Nice. Now it's clear. I don't see anyone. Oh, cross, across. They're both up.
[27:36.800 --> 27:38.800]  Oh, I'm hurt. I'm going to hide. Yeah,
[27:38.800 --> 27:48.420]  I got hurt bad by a grenade, I think. Good grenade. Good grenade. Okay, I'm with you. Drop down.
[27:50.440 --> 27:53.360]  Son of a bitch. Wow. Somebody quit on Jimmy's legs.
[27:55.960 --> 28:00.860]  It's just Jimmy's legs left. We can't get anyone to play with us.
[28:09.790 --> 28:10.190]  Nice.
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.260]  He was trying, he tried really hard to do the thing where you like ninja jump,
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.720]  and I just looked up and hit him in the back. It did not work at all.
[28:28.880 --> 28:31.500]  They just keep holding. Okay, left, left, left.
[28:35.490 --> 28:36.670]  Is that going to kill me? Yep.
[28:40.450 --> 28:47.250]  Oh, he's hurt. The antlers guy's hurt. Yeah, they're chasing me. They're chasing me.
[28:51.940 --> 28:57.000]  Fuck me. I did not expect the boost. We traded at least, but...
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.140]  It was like a bullet. We're only down by two. Okay.
[29:00.880 --> 29:03.600]  I'm with you. Left, left, left.
[29:06.540 --> 29:07.840]  And then right.
[29:09.660 --> 29:16.160]  Oh, they're on me. They're on me. Fuck. They're on me. Fuck. Okay, that's fine.
[29:19.560 --> 29:21.140]  Uh, I don't want that weapon.
[29:24.620 --> 29:27.020]  I'm going to start pushing to the left and then homing middle.
[29:28.720 --> 29:32.600]  Fuck them. Yeah, no thanks.
[29:37.790 --> 29:41.350]  I mean, that was... good move, good move. Behind us, behind us now, flanking.
[29:50.650 --> 29:53.450]  I didn't know that you move like that. Yep, got him.
[29:54.350 --> 30:02.670]  Ah, the other guy. Fuck, I thought I could hit him. God damn it. Damn. Okay, four point swing.
[30:02.730 --> 30:10.210]  We can do this. Let's just be really good. They already got it. Oh, damn.
[30:11.010 --> 30:13.630]  Uh. Alright, they're coming behind me.
[30:14.670 --> 30:21.450]  Yeah, that's our overshield, buddy. Nice. Did we get him? Oh, yeah, we got him.
[30:21.470 --> 30:25.070]  I hate those grenades.
[30:30.470 --> 30:36.030]  Okay, got him. Well done. Oh, other guy's coming. Jimmy's legs.
[30:37.130 --> 30:41.290]  Where? Nice. Okay, trying to get to you to support.
[30:42.710 --> 30:52.440]  Okay. Don't see anyone. On me, on me, on me. Oh, shit, I stuck you.
[30:56.610 --> 31:00.380]  Fuck. You got me in the back.
[31:03.520 --> 31:04.660]  You uncooled me.
[31:06.540 --> 31:12.180]  I was trying to... I like used my jets to thrust backwards because I saw grenades coming.
[31:12.180 --> 31:15.280]  I stuck you. I didn't know they were coming from both ways. In the panic,
[31:15.420 --> 31:17.780]  I got turned around and then I threw a second grenade at you.
[31:19.700 --> 31:29.020]  Fuck. Damn. Alright, that was leg day. You better come back here leg day. I want a round five.
[31:31.960 --> 31:36.740]  What is that? We're doing like a best of seven series with Jimmy's legs and it's 2-2 currently.
[31:39.240 --> 31:40.640]  I got some points.
[31:42.480 --> 31:47.940]  Okay, now I need to complete seven more matches for one of my bounties. That's the like most
[31:47.940 --> 31:57.310]  time consuming one by far. Jimmy's legs are too powerful. They are. I blame legs, so do I. Let's...
[31:57.310 --> 32:02.490]  all the excuses. Network switches. I don't even know what that means, but it's a thing people
[32:02.490 --> 32:17.670]  complain about. Netcode. This is the one. This is the game. Oh, man. This game is Halo Infinite.
[32:18.830 --> 32:24.630]  The amount of times I've bumped my headset, my Xbox headset on my pop filter. I'm doing it
[32:24.630 --> 32:29.110]  constantly. I'm hitting upwards of six. The little mic into my proper mic. Yeah,
[32:29.510 --> 32:35.570]  all the time. I twist my head to look at the chat. It just punches my pop filter. I'm hooking it.
[32:38.410 --> 32:42.390]  We back with Jimmy? Oh, we better be. Jimmy better not have gone anywhere.
[32:44.630 --> 32:54.970]  Look at us. It's just a couple of Spartans ready to break some legs. No, he's gone. He stopped.
[32:55.150 --> 33:04.270]  Oh, shit. Oh, this is that Halo one map. Yeah, it is. Oh, this is that was I fucked up so bad.
[33:04.510 --> 33:10.130]  I didn't do anything. I threw like such a low percentage grenade throw. At least you lived.
[33:10.130 --> 33:15.930]  Good job. I'm still in the thick of it, though. Oh, there's a guy below us. He's got rocket.
[33:17.250 --> 33:22.330]  I'm getting it. Oh, sorry. You can have it. I'm running back up.
[33:29.450 --> 33:36.790]  I want the camera. Did you get the camera? No. Nope. They did. They did. They definitely did.
[33:36.970 --> 33:41.030]  That was like the predator killed me. That was insane. It was incredible.
[33:42.170 --> 33:43.850]  It's the timing of me asking.
[33:46.610 --> 33:51.470]  Where is he? Oh, I got him. I got him. I got him. Nice. Vengeance.
[33:54.090 --> 33:57.970]  I'm not used to all these weapon skins that are around now. I've got to get me some. Yeah,
[33:58.350 --> 34:03.810]  there's quite a few. They have a free shop for items now as well. The original weapon skins
[34:04.390 --> 34:08.410]  took freaking ages to unlock. Oh, rockets.
[34:13.130 --> 34:18.450]  No, you will not escape. You will not. I feel like he escaped. He went up.
[34:19.810 --> 34:26.890]  No, he didn't. Oh, God. I just got rained on with junk. Rabo 4 landed on you. Yeah.
[34:29.090 --> 34:34.530]  Oh, oh, he's ziplined. That was so cool. I don't even know how to get up to you.
[34:34.910 --> 34:41.410]  I don't know this map. It's this way. And then, okay, I can fight people. Yeah.
[34:45.810 --> 34:48.730]  Got bloody shotgun skin of pimps here for some reason.
[34:50.570 --> 34:54.510]  Oh, shit. Oh, please fall off the map. Damn it. He landed on something.
[34:59.960 --> 35:04.100]  The camera's back up. I'm going to grab it just so they don't. Popping it.
[35:07.100 --> 35:10.300]  Did you get like six shots in the shotgun? That's stinge.
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.220]  It's pretty limited. I'm just looking down at that rocket launcher.
[35:19.860 --> 35:28.120]  Oh, I'm going to get him. Oh, no, I missed. Oh, that was going to be so cool. I missed.
[35:28.460 --> 35:33.300]  Did he get it? Yeah, but he's dead. It should be down there with one rocket.
[35:33.300 --> 35:38.500]  Okay. I dropped down on him and I hit him in like the shoulder instead of the back.
[35:38.660 --> 35:42.820]  Okay. They just went through the teleporter. I'm looking for his rocket.
[35:43.680 --> 35:46.020]  I found it too late. I found it too late. Fuck.
[35:47.980 --> 36:01.270]  Tie game. Okay. They probably have rockets. They definitely have rockets. They are out of rockets.
[36:05.610 --> 36:11.930]  I blew myself up. That was not good for us. That was a bad turn.
[36:12.930 --> 36:19.310]  All right. Where are you at? I just went through that green teleporter thing. Oh, oh, that's it.
[36:22.430 --> 36:24.110]  Oh, he almost escaped.
[36:31.570 --> 36:33.650]  There we go. We're back. Very nice.
[36:37.180 --> 36:39.390]  Okay, pull him back, pull him back, pull him back. He's in there.
[36:44.560 --> 36:47.760]  You're going to get camo? Yeah, I'll grab it.
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.780]  Rockets should probably be up too as well pretty soon. Yeah, they're about halfway.
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.420]  And pop camo. They're pretty.
[37:00.800 --> 37:03.840]  Realize I probably shouldn't hide directly behind you when you're invisible.
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.800]  I watched Predator 2 the other day because I'd never seen it. And what a dumb movie.
[37:12.080 --> 37:17.900]  Is it shite? What if it? Yeah, parts of it are fun, but a lot of it is just stupid.
[37:23.650 --> 37:28.330]  Gary Busey being ridiculous as he does, but I think it's prior to his accident.
[37:28.890 --> 37:33.090]  Oh. Right below us, I assume. Okay.
[37:36.450 --> 37:42.170]  There's a scene where the Predator walks through water stomping and being all electrical for no
[37:42.170 --> 37:47.170]  reason outside of it looks cool. Like, it's just so not what that character is about. It's great.
[37:50.600 --> 37:51.220]  Oops.
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.220]  Are they above?
[37:59.540 --> 38:01.080]  One below, one above.
[38:06.830 --> 38:07.450]  Nice.
[38:07.450 --> 38:08.890]  Remain calm.
[38:11.060 --> 38:16.180]  The rockets ever come back? Yes, they have rockets. Or at least they should.
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.020]  Okay, I'll just fling it back to them.
[38:22.550 --> 38:25.070]  It's not the guy that has them. There he is.
[38:27.150 --> 38:30.350]  How did that fling go? I forgot the button. Fling it real good.
[38:30.850 --> 38:34.050]  I don't know what I was doing.
[38:38.880 --> 38:41.820]  Oh, fuck. Okay. They're out of rockets.
[38:42.960 --> 38:43.860]  Oh, shit.
[38:47.900 --> 38:51.760]  The one thing that was really cool in Predator 2 is there's a scene
[38:51.760 --> 38:55.720]  near the end where you see the Predator's trophies and he has a Xenomorph head.
[38:56.100 --> 38:59.260]  And I assume that's the first, like, connection movie-wise.
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.160]  Oh, is that what caused the movie's franchises to, like, fuse together?
[39:04.180 --> 39:05.800]  I assume so.
[39:08.320 --> 39:11.740]  But if you didn't know that going into it, that must have been a cool moment in the theater.
[39:13.260 --> 39:16.320]  Fuck. Okay, we lost the lead. We really need- we gotta win this.
[39:16.620 --> 39:23.180]  Okay. Oh, you're above me. Shit. How do I get up there?
[39:24.780 --> 39:25.360]  Uh... Okay.
[39:25.560 --> 39:26.540]  Yeah, you figured it out.
[39:27.680 --> 39:28.360]  I'm panicking.
[39:30.900 --> 39:32.440]  If you want to pull back...
[39:32.440 --> 39:32.620]  Yep.
[39:37.220 --> 39:40.160]  Okay, never mind. Let's just adjust. Let's move.
[39:45.990 --> 39:50.830]  Wow, I cannot jump to make that lip to save my life.
[39:54.470 --> 39:55.530]  A rocket's coming out.
[39:55.610 --> 39:55.810]  Ow, behind!
[39:57.450 --> 39:57.850]  Predator!
[40:00.110 --> 40:00.950]  Oh, well done. You got him.
[40:00.950 --> 40:02.310]  Okay, well, at least I killed him.
[40:02.730 --> 40:06.450]  Yeah, I mean, I shouldn't have been able to do that, so...
[40:06.450 --> 40:10.330]  Keeping it within two, that rocket might be a pretty significant push point.
[40:13.290 --> 40:14.850]  I don't think I can get to it.
[40:14.850 --> 40:15.130]  Behind you!
[40:16.670 --> 40:18.330]  I'm hoping I knocked him off with me.
[40:18.410 --> 40:20.690]  Oh, he had fucking- he had the grappling hook!
[40:21.110 --> 40:21.710]  Damn it.
[40:22.310 --> 40:23.170]  Did he live?
[40:23.410 --> 40:25.590]  Okay. Yeah, he grappled out of it.
[40:26.010 --> 40:26.370]  Oh, wow.
[40:26.830 --> 40:27.750]  Now he died, but...
[40:28.910 --> 40:30.010]  They don't lose points for that.
[40:30.010 --> 40:30.250]  Rocket?
[40:31.510 --> 40:33.270]  Oh, I forgot it was to 20.
[40:33.790 --> 40:36.790]  I'm so used to it being to 25 in my- I- oh, damn.
[40:37.130 --> 40:37.290]  Okay.
[40:39.150 --> 40:40.410]  Nudstrup, 10 gifted subs.
[40:40.530 --> 40:41.770]  Holy shit!
[40:42.710 --> 40:44.550]  Thank you so much, Nudstrup.
[40:47.850 --> 40:48.830]  Thanks for all the subs.
[40:50.090 --> 40:53.750]  This person drops, like, 10 subs every time we stream. It's incredible.
[40:54.090 --> 40:55.650]  They do? That's insane.
[40:56.010 --> 40:57.430]  I've seen their name many times.
[40:58.870 --> 41:01.530]  Nudstrup. M. Nudstrup. I'm gonna remember that.
[41:03.570 --> 41:06.470]  Thank you so much. That's so generous. It means a lot to us.
[41:08.790 --> 41:13.390]  As you can tell by this setup, it's not exactly like we have the greatest of-
[41:13.390 --> 41:16.430]  the highest level of technical understanding.
[41:16.430 --> 41:17.150]  Or supplies.
[41:17.670 --> 41:18.290]  For me, at least.
[41:22.860 --> 41:23.520]  Okay.
[41:24.160 --> 41:25.540]  Going into doubles again.
[41:26.240 --> 41:26.880]  What do I need?
[41:29.940 --> 41:36.800]  We need one more win, six more games, four more games, 5,000 more points.
[41:39.670 --> 41:44.030]  And then I'm- I'm on to the ultimate challenge, which is a thousand points.
[41:45.070 --> 41:46.690]  A thousand Spartan currency.
[41:49.650 --> 41:50.770]  Spartan bucks.
[41:54.290 --> 41:56.130]  What would you spend your Spartan bucks on?
[41:57.710 --> 42:00.410]  I would buy some Spartan shoes with them, I think.
[42:01.250 --> 42:03.030]  I could spend Spartan bucks on anything.
[42:03.330 --> 42:09.050]  Out of the entire Spartan equipment section, I would most trust myself with the boots.
[42:09.990 --> 42:10.890]  I feel like they're real sturdy.
[42:11.230 --> 42:11.990]  You wouldn't want a shield?
[42:13.710 --> 42:15.370]  I wouldn't trust myself with that.
[42:15.470 --> 42:18.230]  I'm sure I would do something horrific if given that shield.
[42:23.890 --> 42:25.730]  Grappling hook, don't trust myself with it.
[42:25.910 --> 42:28.410]  The launching thing, absolutely not.
[42:28.510 --> 42:29.650]  I would be so stressed.
[42:29.830 --> 42:30.630]  The repulsor thing?
[42:30.770 --> 42:31.350]  Give me the shoes.
[42:31.750 --> 42:32.030]  Yeah.
[42:33.290 --> 42:38.610]  Fling a soda into somebody's head or like just accidentally bump it and launch somebody.
[42:38.870 --> 42:40.450]  You're just asking to kill someone by accident with that.
[42:40.530 --> 42:42.990]  It- yeah, it's just- it's so dangerous.
[42:47.470 --> 42:51.110]  Let's see if we can get a- oh, I got the grappling hook immediately.
[42:51.690 --> 42:53.050]  Oh, I want this needler.
[42:53.310 --> 42:54.050]  Things stick.
[42:54.170 --> 42:55.150]  Yeah, you get it.
[43:05.000 --> 43:05.900]  Oh, come on.
[43:07.080 --> 43:07.920]  Oh, you got it.
[43:08.060 --> 43:08.460]  Very well.
[43:08.820 --> 43:08.980]  Yeah.
[43:11.100 --> 43:13.060]  I want the- the hammer.
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.940]  Little, uh, driftball action.
[43:17.280 --> 43:18.580]  And I lost it immediately.
[43:18.720 --> 43:19.580]  As soon as I said-
[43:19.580 --> 43:20.740]  Oh, shit!
[43:20.940 --> 43:21.260]  Yeah, you did.
[43:25.240 --> 43:26.500]  He crushed you.
[43:28.540 --> 43:32.120]  People don't realize right now they're playing against two of the oldest
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.000]  driftball players in the world.
[43:34.400 --> 43:35.260]  That's true!
[43:36.180 --> 43:38.900]  We're the most seasoned athletes in this game.
[43:41.660 --> 43:47.500]  Are there any other- I mean, I guess I would call it canon sports?
[43:48.020 --> 43:50.880]  Like, set up sports in the Halo universe?
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.380]  There have to be, right?
[43:53.440 --> 43:55.980]  But like, I can't think of any other ones where it's like-
[43:56.500 --> 43:58.920]  This is a legitimate sport within world?
[44:03.130 --> 44:07.250]  I bet you there's like some art of like, a fake baseball team.
[44:07.330 --> 44:08.590]  Oh, he's got the needler.
[44:09.170 --> 44:10.070]  Good job.
[44:13.880 --> 44:16.580]  Oh, you're bringing out the old driftball skills.
[44:18.660 --> 44:19.740]  Guess who's back?
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.200]  Oh, I picked up your Christmas pistol.
[44:23.460 --> 44:24.840]  That is an ugly piece of shit.
[44:24.980 --> 44:25.500]  You should-
[44:26.540 --> 44:27.540]  It's Christmas!
[44:27.940 --> 44:29.940]  You've been using these skins for so long.
[44:31.240 --> 44:34.900]  Well, it's- I use them year-round, and it's only-
[44:34.900 --> 44:38.420]  Like, it works now, but it's funny outside of any other season.
[44:38.540 --> 44:39.840]  I couldn't be more Christmassy.
[44:41.220 --> 44:42.000]  They got the hammer again.
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.860]  Got my stupid hat, I got my skins. Yeah, they do.
[44:51.020 --> 44:52.920]  The range on the hammer is ridiculous.
[44:53.100 --> 44:55.820]  I keep forgetting it's not like an area thing, it's like a jet thing.
[44:59.780 --> 45:00.500]  Oh no!
[45:01.780 --> 45:03.020]  I was not ready for two of them.
[45:06.970 --> 45:08.390]  Please tell me he didn't grab it.
[45:09.690 --> 45:11.770]  Oh, he's got the needler, doesn't even matter.
[45:12.270 --> 45:12.410]  Oh.
[45:12.630 --> 45:13.710]  They got all the power weapons.
[45:19.150 --> 45:19.870]  All right.
[45:21.650 --> 45:22.430]  We're on a team.
[45:23.350 --> 45:23.710]  Yep.
[45:24.450 --> 45:25.230]  We're playing to win.
[45:26.170 --> 45:27.670]  Playing to win, as we do.
[45:27.990 --> 45:30.370]  What's the quantum bull bag? What is this thing?
[45:30.410 --> 45:34.190]  It's, uh, you put it down, and then I can teleport to wherever I put it.
[45:35.470 --> 45:36.970]  Can you tele-frag people?
[45:38.510 --> 45:40.130]  I don't even know what you mean by that.
[45:41.670 --> 45:42.470]  Oh no!
[45:43.950 --> 45:46.790]  That's, uh, unfortunate.
[45:47.450 --> 45:51.430]  Tele-frag is when you, uh, when someone's stood on like the out point.
[45:52.810 --> 45:54.390]  The exit point of a teleport.
[45:57.830 --> 45:59.550]  Ah, I don't think so.
[46:00.690 --> 46:01.750]  Could do it in the first Halo.
[46:04.750 --> 46:07.050]  It's the Halo I would say played the least.
[46:08.150 --> 46:08.510]  Halo 1?
[46:09.410 --> 46:09.730]  Yeah.
[46:12.190 --> 46:13.730]  I freaking loved it.
[46:14.750 --> 46:19.590]  I don't think I re- like, I got my Xbox right before Halo 2 came out, so.
[46:20.570 --> 46:23.890]  And then once Halo 2 came out, I had no reason to play Halo 1.
[46:24.850 --> 46:26.050]  Outside of, like, the campaign.
[46:28.330 --> 46:29.090]  He's back!
[46:29.830 --> 46:30.590]  He's back!
[46:30.790 --> 46:31.330]  It's bullshit!
[46:31.330 --> 46:32.150]  Oh, you got close.
[46:32.350 --> 46:33.130]  It's bullshit!
[46:33.250 --> 46:33.610]  Yeah.
[46:34.850 --> 46:35.290]  Yeah.
[46:35.670 --> 46:37.650]  I was like a double-decker bus away from him.
[46:41.530 --> 46:45.830]  What I really like about your analogy is a double-decker bus isn't necessarily longer
[46:45.830 --> 46:46.850]  than a single-decker.
[46:47.010 --> 46:47.790]  It's just higher.
[46:47.870 --> 46:49.790]  It's a higher, it's a taller bus.
[46:50.390 --> 46:51.210]  Could have just been a bus.
[46:51.830 --> 46:55.910]  It could have just been a bus, but I appreciated the imagery.
[46:56.070 --> 46:56.950]  I like the double-decker.
[46:57.590 --> 46:58.770]  A greyhound bus!
[47:00.130 --> 47:01.470]  He's a greyhound away.
[47:01.670 --> 47:02.670]  Nah, double-decker's better.
[47:03.710 --> 47:04.610]  You made the right call.
[47:04.730 --> 47:05.410]  This is very funny.
[47:09.150 --> 47:10.430]  This is my worst game yet.
[47:10.450 --> 47:12.390]  I've somehow lost everything I regained.
[47:13.190 --> 47:15.770]  I'm just shooting it in the walls, so you're fine.
[47:17.570 --> 47:18.290]  Doing terrible.
[47:19.670 --> 47:19.810]  Oh!
[47:20.130 --> 47:20.830]  Hey, you got that guy!
[47:20.950 --> 47:21.270]  Good job!
[47:21.850 --> 47:22.530]  Damn, that's great!
[47:23.730 --> 47:24.350]  I'll go that guy too.
[47:29.690 --> 47:30.310]  Oh boy.
[47:30.370 --> 47:32.630]  Well, this is, I think, a loss, but that's okay.
[47:33.170 --> 47:36.270]  You know, we gotta distribute some wins to the people every once in a while.
[47:41.420 --> 47:42.340]  Blew myself up!
[47:43.040 --> 47:43.800]  I'm good.
[47:45.260 --> 47:45.960]  Just get me.
[47:46.600 --> 47:47.700]  Come get me, people!
[47:48.220 --> 47:51.560]  And then we'll do one more game, it'll take us to 5-0-1, and we're gonna win.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.300]  It'll be perfect.
[47:52.680 --> 47:53.900]  I think we got three to win.
[47:53.980 --> 47:54.060]  We gotta play until we win.
[47:55.500 --> 47:56.180]  You think you're gonna...
[47:56.180 --> 47:57.540]  Okay, well, let's win next game.
[48:06.030 --> 48:07.330]  Oh, people are drinking?
[48:08.650 --> 48:10.030]  Oh, we got drinks in the chat?
[48:11.350 --> 48:12.930]  People are on the sauce tonight?
[48:13.990 --> 48:14.170]  I'm gonna get a drink.
[48:14.190 --> 48:18.390]  I'm gonna be honest, Gavin, I think I would want a refund from Vimto if it's still applicable.
[48:21.790 --> 48:23.050]  I'm not loving this.
[48:23.550 --> 48:29.370]  I made a Vimto joke, or a Vimto reference in the latest slow-mo video I put up.
[48:30.050 --> 48:30.770]  Oh yeah?
[48:31.490 --> 48:35.030]  I haven't thought about Vimto in many years, and now it's just Vimto Central.
[48:37.770 --> 48:43.250]  The game froze on my screen, and it froze in a way that's fucking awesome.
[48:43.250 --> 48:44.870]  Oh wow, we look cool.
[48:45.290 --> 48:47.030]  There we go. Now we're back.
[48:48.310 --> 48:49.590]  I want those skins!
[48:51.130 --> 48:53.190]  Someone's taking a shot every time I get a kill?
[48:53.470 --> 48:54.370]  Well, you'll be fine.
[49:01.150 --> 49:03.050]  A lot of people have seen that slow-mo.
[49:03.610 --> 49:05.870]  Definitely the most gruesome video I've ever made.
[49:08.050 --> 49:10.990]  I have a bit that I haven't... I don't know how to do it,
[49:11.470 --> 49:15.970]  but I get your slow-mo guys' videos on my TikTok all the time, and I always like them.
[49:16.210 --> 49:17.470]  I want to support you and your slow-mo work.
[49:17.470 --> 49:17.950]  Oh, thanks.
[49:18.790 --> 49:21.010]  And I want to do a bit, but I can't.
[49:21.530 --> 49:23.830]  Eric would just hate it, and I think Geoff wouldn't mind,
[49:24.190 --> 49:26.110]  where I just keep sending them your stuff and be like,
[49:26.170 --> 49:30.390]  Hey, you see this? You see this? This is crazy!
[49:32.250 --> 49:34.370]  But I don't have anyone I could do it to.
[49:34.510 --> 49:37.430]  I think it's a funny premise, but as I said, I don't think Geoff would care,
[49:37.570 --> 49:40.470]  and Eric would just be annoyed in a way that I wouldn't want him to be.
[49:42.290 --> 49:43.290]  You should send them to me.
[49:45.550 --> 49:46.750]  Are you on TikTok?
[49:47.190 --> 49:47.430]  No.
[49:48.630 --> 49:49.730]  There we go. That's the problem.
[49:50.750 --> 49:53.510]  I'll just send you links, which I did that before.
[49:54.070 --> 49:57.210]  You had a little TikTok hiccup with one of your things, and I sent you a link.
[49:57.250 --> 49:59.190]  I was like, Hey, I want to look into this.
[49:59.450 --> 49:59.790]  Very true.
[49:59.830 --> 50:00.270]  Audio's a little off.
[50:01.210 --> 50:02.990]  Yeah, I don't run my socials.
[50:04.430 --> 50:04.790]  Me?
[50:05.330 --> 50:08.550]  Imagine me telling you the audio's off on a production?
[50:08.890 --> 50:09.150]  Me.
[50:09.670 --> 50:10.310]  I did that.
[50:10.310 --> 50:12.010]  Must be pretty bad if you...
[50:15.450 --> 50:15.770]  Okay.
[50:17.310 --> 50:18.230]  Overshield is up.
[50:19.030 --> 50:20.290]  I'm not going to go for the skewer.
[50:20.430 --> 50:21.110]  I think I'm going to push.
[50:22.450 --> 50:22.770]  Overshield.
[50:23.590 --> 50:24.010]  Oh, they went.
[50:25.470 --> 50:26.070]  Oh, I did it!
[50:27.830 --> 50:28.570]  Son of a bitch.
[50:29.330 --> 50:30.430]  He dropped on my head.
[50:36.070 --> 50:37.170]  Oh, this is not good.
[50:43.570 --> 50:44.090]  Give it to me.
[50:44.130 --> 50:44.430]  Give it to me.
[50:44.490 --> 50:44.850]  Give it to me.
[50:46.310 --> 50:46.570]  Ha!
[50:48.650 --> 50:51.810]  No, I don't run my slow-mo guys' socials.
[50:52.070 --> 50:59.570]  They are run by Charles, his company, who is my RTX guardian from back in the day.
[51:01.550 --> 51:02.630]  I liked him.
[51:04.110 --> 51:05.910]  So now we work together a little bit.
[51:09.570 --> 51:12.550]  I was about to ask a really bad question to ask you.
[51:14.090 --> 51:15.690]  It was just a no-win.
[51:15.790 --> 51:17.050]  It was just to put you in a bad spot.
[51:17.390 --> 51:17.610]  Oh.
[51:19.010 --> 51:19.670]  It's funny.
[51:20.190 --> 51:22.150]  My brain just immediately went to,
[51:22.810 --> 51:24.650]  you work with anyone you don't like?
[51:24.810 --> 51:27.010]  And then just went, no, that's a terrible question.
[51:27.130 --> 51:27.950]  You don't ask somebody.
[51:29.270 --> 51:30.670]  Almost certainly they do.
[51:30.910 --> 51:32.630]  I mean, you work with enough people.
[51:32.730 --> 51:33.930]  There's going to be someone you dislike.
[51:34.230 --> 51:34.870]  That's fine.
[51:36.190 --> 51:38.990]  I was just more thinking about us and all the, you know, the regulation crew.
[51:39.130 --> 51:40.590]  We're lucky that, you know, I...
[51:40.590 --> 51:41.550]  Yeah, I think it's all...
[51:41.550 --> 51:45.270]  I don't want to speak for you, but I love everybody that we get to work with.
[51:48.540 --> 51:49.140]  Dissolved him.
[51:51.420 --> 51:55.560]  See, if I was Geoff right now, I'd turn it into a whole bit about how you hate Nick secretly.
[51:55.780 --> 51:57.120]  You secretly do not like Nick.
[51:57.220 --> 51:58.200]  You're always fighting.
[51:58.240 --> 51:59.480]  I don't think anyone could hate Nick.
[52:00.760 --> 52:02.640]  It would be really difficult to hate Nick.
[52:03.780 --> 52:06.860]  Nick is the type of person where if somebody told me they really hate Nick,
[52:06.940 --> 52:08.760]  I would be like, oh, what's wrong with you?
[52:09.320 --> 52:12.420]  This is actually a red flag about you and not another person.
[52:14.860 --> 52:16.840]  Yeah, it's just like, yeah, you're probably the problem.
[52:17.600 --> 52:18.400]  Yeah, I...
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  Something's off with you, and you do not realize what you just told me.
[52:24.060 --> 52:25.120]  I got the overshield.
[52:25.660 --> 52:25.840]  Okay.
[52:28.340 --> 52:29.620]  Oh, god damn, where is he?
[52:31.200 --> 52:31.860]  Uh, below.
[52:31.940 --> 52:32.700]  Oh, my gun's empty.
[52:32.800 --> 52:33.840]  Holy shit, what an idiot.
[52:36.060 --> 52:36.500]  Thank you.
[52:36.600 --> 52:37.040]  Well, you survived it.
[52:38.520 --> 52:39.940]  What the fuck happened to you?
[52:42.580 --> 52:43.720]  Oh, there you are.
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.460]  This is a rematch of the last guys.
[52:47.040 --> 52:47.820]  Oh, is it?
[52:48.700 --> 52:49.020]  Yeah.
[52:50.600 --> 52:52.140]  Okay, skewer's up again.
[52:52.840 --> 52:53.420]  Rather have.
[52:54.900 --> 52:56.420]  The skewer's just gonna get me killed.
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.160]  I shot so many walls.
[53:05.840 --> 53:08.280]  It's so embarrassing with this gun because it's just late.
[53:08.360 --> 53:09.360]  You just see them bouncing.
[53:10.080 --> 53:11.300]  Lasers bouncing everywhere.
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.060]  I still don't understand this oval, this ball, this bubble shield.
[53:15.200 --> 53:15.980]  Is it like...
[53:15.980 --> 53:16.340]  Yeah.
[53:16.340 --> 53:17.320]  Just invisibility?
[53:17.760 --> 53:19.100]  Or like, uh, blocks their vision?
[53:19.220 --> 53:20.140]  Or is it actually a shield?
[53:21.820 --> 53:23.720]  I don't have an answer for you.
[53:23.960 --> 53:26.380]  Because I also don't feel like I fully understand.
[53:26.980 --> 53:29.100]  All I know is I get inside and I can't see shit.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.220]  And I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[53:30.480 --> 53:31.440]  Oh, god!
[53:33.680 --> 53:36.360]  I typically use it as like, uh, as a cover.
[53:36.920 --> 53:37.280]  Oh, okay.
[53:40.140 --> 53:40.940]  I think...
[53:41.840 --> 53:43.900]  I think bullets can't go through it, maybe?
[53:43.980 --> 53:44.940]  But grenades can?
[53:45.640 --> 53:47.280]  Oh, that's a nice little hiding spot you got there.
[53:47.300 --> 53:48.720]  I'll try and pull him to you and you can assassinate him.
[53:48.720 --> 53:49.640]  Yeah, I was just gonna lure him.
[53:51.180 --> 53:52.120]  I'll try to bring him over.
[53:52.620 --> 53:53.680]  You hold, you stay there.
[53:53.920 --> 53:54.460]  Bit of bum bait.
[53:55.340 --> 53:55.800]  Oh, he's under.
[53:55.900 --> 53:56.520]  I think he's going around.
[53:56.740 --> 53:57.620]  Oh, he's looping around.
[53:57.820 --> 53:58.120]  He might flank.
[53:58.200 --> 53:58.680]  He's looping around.
[53:58.800 --> 53:59.620]  We'll have to lure him the other way.
[53:59.720 --> 54:01.500]  Yeah, I'm gonna try to lure him the other way.
[54:01.740 --> 54:01.860]  Okay.
[54:02.420 --> 54:02.800]  That's what I'm doing.
[54:03.180 --> 54:04.260]  Okay, he's running, he's running.
[54:04.340 --> 54:05.180]  Okay, there's two of them.
[54:05.760 --> 54:06.020]  Oh!
[54:06.240 --> 54:06.520]  Oh!
[54:06.740 --> 54:07.240]  First fight!
[54:09.920 --> 54:11.120]  I caught the end of that!
[54:15.360 --> 54:16.480]  Oh, we missed 5-0-1!
[54:16.480 --> 54:17.260]  It's 5-0-2!
[54:17.500 --> 54:18.260]  Oh, man!
[54:18.400 --> 54:18.640]  Oh, shit!
[54:19.200 --> 54:20.180]  5-0-2!
[54:21.600 --> 54:24.540]  One minute less great than 5-0-1.
[54:25.220 --> 54:28.080]  And if we win, we're 5-0 done.
[54:29.280 --> 54:31.400]  That's right, and it's looking great for a win.
[54:31.480 --> 54:34.180]  It would be a complete collapse to lose at this point.
[54:34.340 --> 54:34.920]  To a bot.
[54:36.520 --> 54:38.000]  To a... are we playing a bot?
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.720]  Yeah, we're playing a bot in Hab-04.
[54:41.600 --> 54:42.300]  Oh, shit!
[54:45.000 --> 54:45.840]  The dome!
[54:47.140 --> 54:48.340]  Can I shoot through it?
[54:48.460 --> 54:48.980]  I can't shoot through it.
[54:48.980 --> 54:50.280]  I got lost in my own ball.
[54:52.900 --> 54:54.460]  I couldn't see shit in there.
[54:56.300 --> 55:00.500]  I got distracted trying to fire at the dome to see if the bullets were doing anything.
[55:02.580 --> 55:04.080]  Oh, the bot's shooting me.
[55:09.000 --> 55:09.440]  Alright.
[55:15.710 --> 55:16.770]  Where are they hiding?
[55:18.470 --> 55:19.050]  Oh, ow!
[55:19.350 --> 55:19.530]  Oh!
[55:19.970 --> 55:20.190]  Oh!
[55:20.870 --> 55:21.270]  He's hurt.
[55:21.470 --> 55:21.990]  He's one shot.
[55:23.250 --> 55:24.230]  I'm hiding, I'm sorry.
[55:26.470 --> 55:27.530]  I'm weak, I'm weak.
[55:30.980 --> 55:32.200]  I'm gonna try to shove him.
[55:33.560 --> 55:34.720]  I'm gonna try to shove him.
[55:35.400 --> 55:35.900]  Oh, no.
[55:36.400 --> 55:37.840]  I can't see, Gavin!
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.620]  I gotta peek through my little bubble!
[55:43.480 --> 55:44.260]  Where are they?
[55:44.460 --> 55:45.220]  I can push him.
[55:46.680 --> 55:47.220]  Oh, no!
[55:47.540 --> 55:47.580]  Yeah!
[55:51.020 --> 55:52.260]  That was mean.
[55:59.510 --> 56:01.750]  The AI just threw a grenade at itself.
[56:01.870 --> 56:02.930]  It was like, you know what?
[56:03.550 --> 56:05.550]  If someone's taking me out, it's gonna be me.
[56:06.750 --> 56:09.610]  I'm gonna see if I can skew a Hab right in the chin.
[56:11.190 --> 56:13.550]  Well, he's skewerable.
[56:15.190 --> 56:15.950]  Now he's not.
[56:16.030 --> 56:16.510]  Now he's dead.
[56:17.110 --> 56:17.210]  Oh.
[56:22.150 --> 56:22.950]  Okay, let's...
[56:24.310 --> 56:27.170]  I want one of these last two kills to be from your skewer.
[56:27.670 --> 56:27.990]  Yeah.
[56:32.080 --> 56:33.000]  It's a bot.
[56:33.220 --> 56:33.920]  It's not Hab.
[56:34.340 --> 56:35.080]  Gotta be Hab.
[56:36.160 --> 56:36.960]  Yeah, it's gotta be Hab.
[56:37.160 --> 56:37.440]  Oops.
[56:38.400 --> 56:41.220]  You finish Hab with that skewer, wherever he is.
[56:41.380 --> 56:41.680]  All right.
[56:42.160 --> 56:42.960]  Hab, where are you at, Hab?
[56:43.760 --> 56:44.540]  Where are you hiding?
[56:44.740 --> 56:44.880]  Come on, Hab!
[56:45.480 --> 56:46.640]  We gonna find you, Hab!
[56:49.420 --> 56:50.000]  Habby boy!
[56:50.260 --> 56:50.600]  Hab!
[56:51.860 --> 56:52.300]  Habby!
[56:52.560 --> 56:53.000]  Habson?
[56:53.340 --> 56:54.800]  I think that might be Hab.
[56:55.080 --> 56:55.360]  Oh.
[56:57.320 --> 56:58.120]  Oh, he's down.
[56:58.240 --> 56:58.880]  He's flanking.
[56:59.020 --> 56:59.560]  He's down below.
[57:02.340 --> 57:02.860]  Hab!
[57:03.020 --> 57:03.540]  Got him!
[57:03.760 --> 57:04.100]  Yeah!
[57:07.140 --> 57:08.600]  What a kill!
[57:12.920 --> 57:15.020]  Oh, thank you so much.
[57:15.300 --> 57:15.740]  Halo's fun.
[57:16.420 --> 57:17.720]  Halo is fun.
[57:18.020 --> 57:19.060]  I had a lot of fun, Gavin.
[57:19.620 --> 57:22.680]  I'm sorry for all the technical difficulties at the start.
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.240]  Yeah, sorry that I sound like shit.
[57:26.560 --> 57:28.880]  Let's do one more, because all the stuff broke.
[57:29.260 --> 57:29.600]  Oh, okay.
[57:29.860 --> 57:30.040]  Yeah.
[57:30.520 --> 57:31.200]  Bonus round.
[57:31.420 --> 57:32.680]  It's for... yeah, bonus round.
[57:32.780 --> 57:33.440]  One more round!
[57:36.020 --> 57:36.420]  Uh...
[57:37.200 --> 57:37.600]  Hmm.
[57:37.780 --> 57:38.620]  What do we want to play?
[57:38.840 --> 57:40.020]  Let me see if there's anything fun.
[57:42.180 --> 57:43.280]  Let's do some zombies.
[57:44.340 --> 57:44.600]  Ooh.
[57:44.680 --> 57:45.340]  Let's do infection.
[57:49.090 --> 57:50.170]  See how this goes.
[57:55.200 --> 57:56.540]  Then we can wrap it up.
[58:00.080 --> 58:02.360]  Oh, do I have... what do I need for challenges?
[58:03.200 --> 58:04.560]  I need to play four more games.
[58:05.440 --> 58:06.860]  A bunch of points.
[58:09.480 --> 58:11.300]  I do only have one swap left.
[58:15.110 --> 58:21.430]  Seems like cheap TVs were the Black Friday gets this year.
[58:21.530 --> 58:21.770]  Yeah.
[58:23.990 --> 58:25.950]  That's probably what I saw the most in chat.
[58:37.830 --> 58:39.210]  Excited for your Advent stuff.
[58:39.310 --> 58:40.070]  Yeah, that's coming up soon.
[58:40.130 --> 58:42.110]  We've recorded almost all of it now, right?
[58:42.930 --> 58:43.250]  Yep.
[58:43.730 --> 58:44.790]  We have, uh...
[58:45.750 --> 58:49.770]  I had an audio issue on one, so I'm gonna have to re-record one day with Eric.
[58:50.230 --> 58:50.630]  Oh, shit.
[58:51.590 --> 58:54.290]  And then we have one final day to do.
[58:54.490 --> 58:55.610]  And then it's all recorded.
[58:56.410 --> 58:58.110]  And, uh, first one goes up on Sunday.
[58:59.330 --> 59:02.050]  Today was my mom's Q&A that went up, which is awesome.
[59:02.050 --> 59:02.670]  Oh, it was so good.
[59:02.930 --> 59:04.030]  So, Falcon, you could go listen to the-
[59:04.030 --> 59:04.850]  I loved it.
[59:04.970 --> 59:05.890]  She sounds amazing.
[59:06.890 --> 59:07.450]  She did great.
[59:12.920 --> 59:13.680]  Oh, it was so good.
[59:13.700 --> 59:17.000]  That was the thing where I was so worried about fucking up the audio for it.
[59:17.020 --> 59:21.780]  I had to adjust all of the balances because her voice is so soft.
[59:22.140 --> 59:22.540]  Yeah.
[59:24.660 --> 59:26.140]  But we figured it out.
[59:26.420 --> 59:28.060]  And I think it turned out pretty good.
[59:28.400 --> 59:28.760]  Sounded great.
[59:31.760 --> 59:32.880]  Great! Hey, look!
[59:33.040 --> 59:33.560]  Look at that!
[59:33.760 --> 59:34.460]  Look at that, Gavin!
[59:34.780 --> 59:35.540]  I've sat there before!
[59:35.540 --> 59:35.680]  Look at that!
[59:38.860 --> 59:39.660]  So crazy.
[59:43.640 --> 59:47.500]  Coffee break said, did you have Thanksgiving with, uh, Barb and Trevor?
[59:47.660 --> 59:48.040]  No!
[59:48.920 --> 59:49.550]  No, I didn't.
[59:50.460 --> 59:53.340]  I had it with Jackie and Alfredo.
[59:53.880 --> 59:54.780]  Okay, well, never mind.
[59:54.860 --> 59:55.520]  The game is over.
[59:55.620 --> 01:00:01.140]  I was gonna say they should just keep throwing out couples until they get it.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.340]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.820]  How many zombies are there?
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.540]  Three? Okay.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.980]  And you're one of them.
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.400]  Okay.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.100]  Yeah.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.620]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.560]  Where's the... I'm trying to find the podcast set.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.860]  Yeah, I want to get on the podcast set.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.220]  Where is it?
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.020]  I have that set now.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.300]  I know!
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.840]  I took it.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.760]  You could play underneath the set in this game while standing virtually beneath the set.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.120]  You could stack the sets.
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.920]  I think we can get closer.
[01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:45.250]  There's a pirate ship.
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.850]  Oh, I'm on the set!
[01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:47.410]  Oh, I got killed on the set!
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.450]  Son of a bitch.
[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.170]  I died right in front of the Tower of Pimps.
[01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.090]  Oh, there it is!
[01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.650]  It's crazy.
[01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:55.970]  Oh, and they have the Tower of Pimps in there.
[01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:56.830]  Oh, that's great.
[01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:57.630]  That's a nice one.
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.850]  That's nuts.
[01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:02.770]  Uh, technically... well, I mean, sort of.
[01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.190]  They bootlegged it.
[01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.690]  It'd be amazing if it was an actual forge item just called Tower of Pimps.
[01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.650]  If you could just, like, pick it from the list.
[01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.070]  Yeah, I like that it's crooked.
[01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.470]  I really appreciate it.
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.470]  Oh, you get the red versus blue things.
[01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:18.970]  Film cameras.
[01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:20.430]  Sandwich.
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.770]  It's so funny how the Tower of Pimps happened.
[01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:33.450]  Like, it's only the size it is because that's just how much gold Ray happened to have mined at that time.
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.950]  But it ended up being perfect.
[01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:39.410]  Like, four blocks is perfect.
[01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.550]  Oh, oh, murder on the set.
[01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.250]  I can finally get to be on the Rooster Teeth podcast.
[01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:48.450]  My dream.
[01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:49.890]  That was your dream?
[01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:51.570]  Well, no.
[01:01:51.810 --> 01:01:52.670]  No, it wasn't.
[01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.750]  But it's, you know what, sure.
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:56.390]  It always seemed fun.
[01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.030]  It seemed like you all had a fun time.
[01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.250]  It seemed like a fun place to be.
[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.190]  Yeah, you easily could have been on it.
[01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.850]  Had you actually wanted to, you could have been on it.
[01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.510]  I was never asked.
[01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:10.230]  I would have said yes.
[01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.110]  I would have accepted.
[01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:18.230]  You know, that's something you should say after or before the company does that podcast
[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:20.930]  for like 15 years and then goes out of business.
[01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:24.470]  Is there anything more obnoxious, though, than telling somebody,
[01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:27.210]  hey, I'm willing to go on your thing like that?
[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.310]  I feel like that would be super obnoxious.
[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.110]  I would never do that.
[01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:33.050]  I think that's how I got on it.
[01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:36.210]  That's, you know what?
[01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.930]  Okay, I should have known.
[01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:43.250]  I was sat in the room where they recorded it, making RVB, and I was like, I would do it.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:48.880]  Okay.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.600]  You just got to talk about headlight fluid and then you're in.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.780]  Oh, I do that all the time.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.700]  For the next decade.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.600]  I didn't get a single kill as a zombie.
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.180]  Got to hang on a podcast set though, and that's pretty cool.
[01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:16.130]  I want you.
[01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.890]  I got, oh, took someone out.
[01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.490]  Where are you at?
[01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:22.610]  Are you a zombie?
[01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:24.090]  I'm a zombie.
[01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:26.290]  I'm dead.
[01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.390]  Oh, the Tower of Pimps isn't crooked.
[01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.630]  So is it like a loose item?
[01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.930]  Is it like a movable thing?
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:32.590]  Oh, you can knock it around?
[01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:34.630]  Oh yeah, I knocked it down.
[01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:35.150]  Oh shit.
[01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:36.510]  Oh no!
[01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.330]  Hey, it's Hab 4.
[01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:47.670]  I remember I went to an RTX one year and it opened with Jeremy performing TLP.
[01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:48.630]  Oh yeah.
[01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:54.170]  I got to, I was in the front row and I felt like my bones were going to leave my skin
[01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:58.330]  because the bass is so loud in that song and I was in front of one of the speakers.
[01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.690]  It rattled me to my core.
[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.010]  Bass is bass.
[01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:05.410]  It was the reverse of an out.
[01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.050]  It was an inner body experience.
[01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:09.810]  My body was like trying to leave itself.
[01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.970]  Physically.
[01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:13.870]  I wish I could talk to all these people in the game.
[01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:15.350]  Hey guys, I made this.
[01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:16.370]  I made this thing.
[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:17.730]  I'm stood on the thing I made.
[01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:18.990]  I did this.
[01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.010]  I was part of this.
[01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.010]  I'm the cause of this for some reason.
[01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:27.790]  I'm just sat on top of the tower.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.840]  Oh, I saw you go into the orb.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.320]  I whiffed so many times, but I got someone.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.760]  Impact intolerant.
[01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:45.710]  Hab almost killed me.
[01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.270]  How is Hab still here?
[01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.030]  We switched playlists.
[01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.850]  He came with us.
[01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:52.430]  He must be watching.
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:54.350]  I think so.
[01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.370]  He's stream sniping.
[01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:56.930]  He's stream sniping?
[01:04:57.330 --> 01:04:57.830]  Hab is stream sniping.
[01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:01.210]  That didn't even occur to me that that would be a possibility, but I guess it could.
[01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:03.130]  Uh oh.
[01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:04.390]  Someone knows where I am.
[01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:16.910]  What's up, dude?
[01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:23.210]  I must avenge my zombie friends.
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:26.310]  For the zombies.
[01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.310]  I'm just hanging out with the zombie.
[01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.130]  We've got an agreement by the looks of it.
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.050]  Oh, Hab!
[01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:31.290]  Yeah?
[01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:32.090]  What's up, Hab, dude?
[01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:35.410]  We're all just looking at me for some reason.
[01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.270]  T-O-P.
[01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.530]  You're the last one left.
[01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.950]  Everyone is coming for you.
[01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:48.330]  They're all just looking at me.
[01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.990]  They're not all going to look at you for long.
[01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:54.350]  No.
[01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.530]  You got killers coming.
[01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.170]  You got killers coming.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.110]  That was scary.
[01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:09.510]  The tower kept me alive for quite a while there.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:21.700]  Okay.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.640]  Hopefully, we're both humans.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.200]  We could go to the podcast set together.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.040]  Hab is in the chat.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:28.600]  What's up, Hab?
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.240]  Hab!
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.740]  Oh, that was great.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.220]  Okay, here we go.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.340]  You human?
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.000]  Are we both human?
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.540]  Let's get to that podcast set.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.140]  Let's go to the set.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.020]  Is it this way?
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.440]  If Hab's a zombie, we're screwed.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.280]  Oh, here it is.
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:56.940]  Okay.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.100]  Let's do this, Gavin.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.560]  Get in position.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.180]  Take a picture of me with the tower.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:02.860]  No, get in position.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.320]  Get on couch.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:03.740]  Get on couch.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.160]  Get in position.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.300]  This is my seat.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:05.900]  Hold on.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:06.980]  My seat.
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:07.820]  Okay, let's do this.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.040]  Okay.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.060]  So, the Austin airport is always under construction.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:13.660]  It's...
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.440]  Look, look.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.860]  It's under construction.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.400]  You always go to the airport.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.080]  Of course it's under construction.
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.700]  What are you talking about?
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.500]  There we go.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.320]  Just a thousand...
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.680]  Imagine that a thousand times.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:26.920]  We did it.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.420]  I went on...
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.400]  I went on Bernie's It's Morning Somewhere podcast again recently.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.040]  And we got into it again about the construction.
[01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:48.310]  Just hanging out, getting points.
[01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:48.750]  I like...
[01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.010]  We're scoring a lot of points for this.
[01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:50.650]  I need points.
[01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:51.470]  One thing...
[01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.830]  I like that.
[01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:58.290]  One thing that you don't get from watching the podcast is how heavy these arches are.
[01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:00.030]  Very thick.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:00.490]  Oh, I imagine.
[01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:01.830]  Very weighty.
[01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:11.630]  I don't go to Jamaica airport.
[01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:19.570]  Like, Jamaica would just have one airport.
[01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.010]  That's such a terrible example.
[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:30.490]  We got double ball?
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:32.490]  Dude, I'm in two bubbles.
[01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:34.430]  There's balls all over the place.
[01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.330]  I don't like it.
[01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:40.570]  What's this a picture of?
[01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.050]  Oh, it's the other map.
[01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.150]  Oh, shit.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:52.900]  Shotgunner.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.820]  I'm out of bullets.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:01.520]  All I got are radar scans.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.960]  It's me and Hab on top of the set.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.440]  Hab, I'm going to protect this.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.020]  Check this out.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.160]  We just got to stay alive for 30 more seconds.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.040]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.640]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:17.460]  Oh, oh.
[01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:27.910]  Yeah, it does block bullets.
[01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:31.570]  Oh, we got to get the last one.
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:32.670]  We only got eight seconds.
[01:09:33.690 --> 01:09:34.130]  Get him.
[01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:36.330]  Get him.
[01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:41.650]  No.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.080]  This goes for a lot of rounds.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.500]  How many rounds is this?
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.160]  Uh.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.140]  At least, at least one more, I want to say.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.780]  I think it was around five.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.120]  Is there like a stage?
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:10.740]  Oh, behind you.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.620]  Stage reference, maybe?
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.620]  Oh, behind me?
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.880]  Oh, you got done by a bot.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.800]  The bot got me.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:17.700]  That's nuts.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.280]  How rude.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.700]  I'm coming for you, Gavin.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:23.660]  Nuh-uh.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.400]  Oh, there's one of those quantum time holes.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.040]  Oh, it's gone.
[01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.430]  I'm coming to the set.
[01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:47.230]  I died doing nothing.
[01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:51.630]  Oh, this was a quick one.
[01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:53.690]  We turn this around.
[01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.030]  Oh, we got to get him.
[01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:01.570]  Holy shit.
[01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:02.170]  Got him.
[01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:06.190]  Yeah, second place.
[01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:09.050]  Hell yeah.
[01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:11.350]  Good games, everyone.
[01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.150]  What a fun last game.
[01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:18.510]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thanksgiving Friday.
[01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:22.930]  We will be back next week without Gavin, but other people.
[01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:23.950]  You're out next weekend.
[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.690]  I am.
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:26.290]  Until then, though.
[01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.470]  Talk to you soon.
[01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.930]  Love you guys.
[01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.270]  Bye.
[01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:29.230]  Thanks for watching.
[01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.390]  Bye.
