[00:00.000 --> 00:05.260]  We should be live. I think. Hello? Everybody there?
[00:06.380 --> 00:09.840]  He said hello to me or everyone? I was just thinking about not talking at all.
[00:10.140 --> 00:14.360]  That would have been such a great prank. I should have texted you.
[00:18.360 --> 00:20.660]  Thank you for not doing that. I appreciate it.
[00:20.940 --> 00:24.580]  Nick would just spend the first five minutes troubleshooting and then just have to play.
[00:25.100 --> 00:35.020]  Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?
[00:35.840 --> 00:38.340]  Oh, hey, what? Oh, I've been here the whole time. Yeah.
[00:39.560 --> 00:44.500]  Oh, man. So, welcome. Hi, everybody. We're playing... well, I'm playing The Last of Us
[00:44.500 --> 00:48.800]  Part 2 Remastered on Grounded Difficulty, which is the hardest difficulty in the game.
[00:49.340 --> 00:53.500]  It basically takes away your HUD. It takes away the ability... like,
[00:53.500 --> 00:58.340]  they do this echolocation thing where you can see enemies through walls based on, like,
[00:58.400 --> 01:02.520]  their little shadows, depending on how close they are to you. It takes away all that stuff.
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.240]  So you're kind of on your own and it makes the game also... you can't tell how much health you
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.380]  have. You die a lot easier and there's a lot less resources. Have you done this before?
[01:11.940 --> 01:17.860]  I've done it on the first game and I thought I was doing it on this game and it turned out
[01:17.860 --> 01:21.260]  they didn't release it until a patch update way later. So I was playing on the hardest
[01:21.260 --> 01:26.000]  difficulty at the time. Is it at least a new game plus? Like, do you have more stuff than normal?
[01:26.440 --> 01:29.140]  I do not. Oh, shit. Yeah.
[01:30.940 --> 01:33.480]  What? You have options? Have you played this game, Gavin?
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.840]  Yes. Okay. So you're familiar. You know everything that's going to happen.
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.540]  This will be new to me, but no one else. Okay. Yeah. Which will be good.
[01:43.700 --> 01:46.360]  How confident are you, Nick? Not very.
[01:48.020 --> 01:51.620]  I mean, Nick, I think has hidden skills, though, because he said he was the best
[01:51.620 --> 01:56.040]  in the world at God of War Ragnarok, which is also like a single player PlayStation game.
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.180]  So he's probably got applicable skills. Yeah.
[02:00.260 --> 02:03.720]  Would you say the gameplay between God of War and Last of Us is very similar?
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.760]  Because I'm playing through God of War right now and it's apparently Last of Us is a very
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.980]  different game than I thought it was. Now, do you guys want to watch the
[02:13.980 --> 02:15.540]  cutscenes or should we skip them? What do you think?
[02:16.020 --> 02:22.840]  I don't give a fuck. Skip. Skip. All right, let's do it. All right.
[02:23.080 --> 02:26.780]  You know what would be cool in a video game is if they gave you the option right there
[02:26.780 --> 02:33.180]  to skip all cutscenes. Oh, like for like from this point on, you just we're not going to make you
[02:33.800 --> 02:38.740]  hold Y. Nobody needs to do that. Yeah. Just tell us. You know what? It's a fair point.
[02:39.620 --> 02:45.460]  You're on an os. Os. God, I'm trying to remember the controls. This may go poorly.
[02:45.940 --> 02:50.400]  I also turned off any tutorial stuff. Now, this guy's Pedro Pascal with the guitar, right?
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.260]  Yes. OK. But in this, he's, you know, Troy Baker. In this, he's Troy Baker.
[02:56.540 --> 03:01.460]  But we are hunting Grogu? Is that what it's called? It's not called Baby Yoda.
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.880]  No, my son gets very mad when he's called Baby Yoda.
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.880]  Am I getting my Pedro Pascal's confused? I'm sorry.
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.860]  Uh, yeah. I mean, there is there is a well, no, I guess she's not a Grogu type character.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.200]  Close enough. Do you think his eyes are going to get thumbed out by the strongest man?
[03:20.600 --> 03:22.700]  The biggest and strongest man? I hope not.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.780]  All right, let's see. We're just going to go. We're just going to go down his IMDb list.
[03:30.580 --> 03:35.400]  Yeah, right. Open the I've just opened the old chat. Could just get a few little piss rats here
[03:35.400 --> 03:40.240]  there. That'd be all right, chat. Where is the piss rat? I haven't seen a little pissy rat
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.020]  because it wouldn't feel like a real stream unless it was flooded with piss rats. There we go.
[03:44.220 --> 03:46.560]  There we are. Look at that stream of piss rat.
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.860]  You've got to love it. I hope somewhere wherever he is, he feels that. I hope he feels that warm
[03:54.860 --> 03:59.180]  golden love. Yeah, somewhere, no matter what he's doing, he just looked up.
[04:01.080 --> 04:05.300]  It's like somebody opened up a window in the sun and suddenly the back of his neck is just all warm
[04:05.300 --> 04:13.880]  and tingly. That's the piss. All right. So this part, I can't fail, I don't think. I've never
[04:13.880 --> 04:22.540]  actually died in this part. Seems a lot like Red Dead 2. Yeah. Oh, another great game. I only played
[04:22.540 --> 04:29.220]  the first hour. Did you really? Yeah. Yeah. What? I'm not a big cowboy guy. Oh, but it doesn't
[04:29.220 --> 04:39.300]  matter. You know the last one, Red Dead 1? I didn't even play that. I don't think I ever tried
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.840]  the single player at all. I played the multiplayer for work, but I don't think I ever... Did you ever
[04:43.840 --> 04:49.260]  play Red Dead Revolver? Nah, I wasn't playing games when that came out, I don't think. I think I was
[04:49.260 --> 05:01.140]  taking my break. I never played Revolver. Yep. Geoff, you're in the fucking game. It's true, I am.
[05:01.260 --> 05:09.140]  I am. I am in the game. Couldn't even be honest and play up to yourself. Yeah, that's kind of
[05:09.140 --> 05:16.460]  lame, right? Like, I'm just gonna go and see myself? Like... I feel like we need to do that
[05:16.460 --> 05:23.060]  video now. I've thought about playing the game. It's a real good game. I love everything Rockstar
[05:23.060 --> 05:33.980]  does. Oh, Red Dead 2 is a masterpiece. Unmissable. Somehow I missed it. I bet you've missed a couple
[05:33.980 --> 05:42.740]  of games there, Gavin. Name one. All right, we're gonna skip all these. We just had a time jump of
[05:42.740 --> 05:53.040]  four years. So this is Ellie, four years later after the first game. I bet you didn't play The
[05:53.040 --> 06:03.060]  Witcher. I did not. Witcher 3 has been on my list. I've actually tried to play it four times and I
[06:03.060 --> 06:10.540]  just can't. I tried to play it twice, get about an hour in, turned it off both times. Dude, we know
[06:10.540 --> 06:16.600]  each other too well. That game does have a really hard barrier to entry in that first spot, though.
[06:16.680 --> 06:22.380]  If you don't get to a certain spot, I feel like everybody who didn't get to this one particular
[06:22.380 --> 06:28.840]  spot stopped playing it. Yeah, it's the inventory system for me really overwhelmed me. You know,
[06:28.860 --> 06:35.360]  when I was a kid, way back in the dark ages, if you were into video games and you met somebody
[06:35.360 --> 06:42.320]  else who was into video games, there was like a 99.9% chance you were into the exact same games
[06:42.320 --> 06:47.860]  because there were like 14 games on Earth. And even in the early Nintendo, even through Super
[06:47.860 --> 06:51.960]  Nintendo, there was still like a 75, 80% chance that you, like if you met somebody, you guys liked
[06:51.960 --> 06:56.820]  all the same shit. But the gaming world is so fucking large now that you can spend an entire
[06:56.820 --> 07:04.060]  life in gaming and not touch huge swaths of it where you could meet somebody who's just as big
[07:04.060 --> 07:11.460]  of a gamer as you and you have zero crossover. Like take NFT Steven here in the chat asking about
[07:11.460 --> 07:18.880]  Elden Ring, Spider-Man. I've not played those, but I have played God of War. It was good.
[07:20.740 --> 07:26.500]  Sorry, go ahead, Geoff. No, you go ahead. I was gonna say when I played it, I set it to the hardest
[07:26.500 --> 07:32.200]  difficulty to start out for some reason. I never do that. But I did that and it's insanely hard
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.780]  at the beginning. But then as your character levels up, everything just gets so much easier
[07:37.780 --> 07:44.660]  to the point where the game felt too easy after that. Oh, wow. Maybe that was just me, but the
[07:44.660 --> 07:50.580]  story is great. I will never pick the hardest difficulty on anything again for as long as I live
[07:50.580 --> 07:57.160]  unless it's for work. Like for God, like we're doing Gears of War in my personal life.
[07:57.160 --> 08:04.260]  There's no why. You could never pay to do this. I feel like hard in video games used to be like
[08:04.860 --> 08:07.620]  challenging. And then as soon as people started making videos,
[08:08.660 --> 08:14.580]  they added like punishment difficulty modes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Like the hardest God of War.
[08:14.820 --> 08:19.180]  I think it's called bring me or give me God of War or something. Yes. Absolutely impossible.
[08:20.420 --> 08:26.880]  Ridiculous. You like can't make a single mistake. No. So weird.
[08:27.920 --> 08:31.400]  I don't know why some people just like, you know, I guess just some people are
[08:32.160 --> 08:38.000]  some people like a challenge and some people are just inherently better at a thing and capable of
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.740]  doing it in a more difficult way than I like. Nick, would you be playing this mode if you were
[08:43.740 --> 08:50.360]  just alone jerking yourself off or is it just because I'm doing it just on stream? The previous
[08:50.360 --> 08:56.020]  one I did on stream during the covid lockdown, which is probably the only reason I ended up
[08:56.020 --> 09:04.800]  doing it at all, because I wanted to have fun. And that I mean, that was fun. Sort of. I did play
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.400]  God of War Ragnarok on give me God of War difficulty and beat it and platinum the game.
[09:11.400 --> 09:18.080]  Sheesh. Yeah. That's why I was like, I'm the best in the world thinking I really have to time it,
[09:18.140 --> 09:25.000]  dude. All right. Do you have to do like the main Valkyrie and like the main king guy on those
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.880]  difficulties too? Uh, you don't have to, but if you want to platinum, yeah, you do. Oh, wow.
[09:30.360 --> 09:36.840]  And you've done all that? I did all that. I love that game so much. I played through it once on the
[09:36.840 --> 09:42.500]  I think it was the hard difficulty, just the regular hard and then instantly rebooted it. Didn't
[09:42.500 --> 09:46.580]  do new game plus for some reason and then just put it on give me God of War. So when Gavin is over
[09:46.580 --> 09:49.940]  here talking about how fucking impossible and hard it is now, you can't make a single mistake. Your
[09:49.940 --> 09:54.220]  balls are just tingling because you're like, yeah, I was itching to say something.
[10:00.140 --> 10:06.080]  I had a, uh, I have a subwoofer that's like under one of my couch segments. It's like a modular
[10:06.080 --> 10:12.720]  couch. And, um, I turned the volume up real good for God of War. And then I blocked an attack by
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.540]  one of those. What is it called when, when you like get trapped in the arena with those blokes?
[10:18.960 --> 10:25.960]  Oh, uh, you like building the taking shards of shit. Oh Christ. I don't remember at this point,
[10:26.060 --> 10:31.920]  man. But I blocked this. I blocked this attack and he went and it shook the room so much that
[10:31.920 --> 10:38.920]  it unplugged the subwoofer. I had to like dismantle the whole couch to find to find the wire.
[10:41.320 --> 10:43.260]  It's like maybe I got the volume up too much.
[10:46.300 --> 10:46.680]  Okay.
[10:50.700 --> 10:55.740]  Oh my God. If I lose in this bit. So, oh my God. I'm getting creamed.
[10:58.120 --> 11:03.020]  I have to go. Oh, do I need this? This is definitely not God of War. Oh, this is bad.
[11:03.180 --> 11:08.560]  This is not God of War. Could you pull out the bow and arrow? Not yet. Oh, oh, there you go.
[11:08.560 --> 11:13.180]  All right, gotta pay attention. Dude, you gotta pay attention. If you can't beat kids,
[11:13.240 --> 11:18.000]  how are you going to beat zombies? Yeah, no kidding. You can tackle that kid. Kick him.
[11:20.780 --> 11:26.780]  Got it. So this is the sequel of the series, right? Yes. This is the second one. Is there a
[11:26.780 --> 11:32.900]  third one on the way? I would assume that they're going to come up with something. Does this,
[11:32.900 --> 11:40.880]  does two like wrap up the story? Some of a story. I would say there's more for them to
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.120]  potentially explore, but they could end it there if they wanted to. But I mean, why would they?
[11:45.180 --> 11:49.780]  This is such a huge hit. Oh yeah. And it's only growing in popularity with the TV show.
[11:50.400 --> 11:57.620]  Okay, there we go. Also, so the thing that we missed earlier in the game is Joel told Tommy,
[11:57.720 --> 12:01.960]  his brother, what he did at the end of the last one to save Ellie. Ellie doesn't know
[12:01.960 --> 12:10.200]  that at that point. And then he teaches Ellie how to play guitar. And like a big part of her
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.680]  story in this game is that she loves to play the guitar. So they kind of bond over music.
[12:16.200 --> 12:21.660]  Sounds like a fun and heartwarming video game. Oh yeah. You know, in between the other stuff.
[12:23.140 --> 12:29.240]  All right, let's go. So we're about to go out on patrol and then I think it might
[12:29.240 --> 12:35.080]  switch perspectives to another character. They did a cool thing in the TV show where they
[12:35.880 --> 12:42.720]  show a flashback to like before anything in the game to Ellie being born. Oh yeah.
[12:42.960 --> 12:49.040]  And they had the voice actress for Ellie play the mother, which was cool. That was awesome.
[12:49.520 --> 12:55.880]  That scene's also very creepy. Yeah, it explains quite a lot. Yeah.
[12:56.620 --> 13:01.020]  That's a good girl. That show is so good. They did a lot of things that
[13:01.020 --> 13:08.180]  expanded that universe. They confirmed what caused the breakout or everything to go south
[13:08.180 --> 13:15.160]  being the infected... what was it? Flour, I think? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was bad sandwiches.
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.620]  And then the Atkins diet ended up being the thing that saved some people.
[13:22.220 --> 13:30.560]  Which was early ketogenic? Yeah, it was keto that saved society. Well, some of it.
[13:31.620 --> 13:38.340]  All right, let's see. So now we switch perspectives to this other character who we don't know yet.
[13:42.740 --> 13:49.560]  And the fan base loves her. Who is she? Her name is Abby and you'll see why people love her
[13:49.560 --> 13:59.600]  in a little while. Does she play guitar as well? No, she's into weightlifting. That's her thing.
[14:01.860 --> 14:07.840]  Do you get to make her lift weights and quicktime event it or smash A a bunch?
[14:08.760 --> 14:11.700]  Not for weightlifting, certainly not the GCN route.
[14:15.100 --> 14:19.800]  But she's pretty stacked. She's got big muscles.
[14:22.320 --> 14:27.420]  At what point did video games replace loading screens with like a little crevice?
[14:28.120 --> 14:29.680]  You did all this in the dark.
[14:32.360 --> 14:38.380]  This generation. Yeah, well, you've always got like hold the door open or like go under something.
[14:38.740 --> 14:45.240]  And yeah, there's a lot of that in God of War. The one I'm playing. Oh, yeah.
[14:46.780 --> 14:49.140]  They make you walk around slowly while something's happening.
[14:50.660 --> 14:53.700]  I'm always ducking under something just to let the map.
[14:54.340 --> 15:00.000]  What? No. It's so exciting to hear about your experience through that game, Geoff,
[15:00.060 --> 15:09.420]  because I found that game late, too. Not that late. Not six years late. I liked it
[15:09.900 --> 15:14.540]  every second of it until yesterday. I had a boss fight that I just did not fucking enjoy.
[15:15.620 --> 15:21.980]  And it took up forever. It was one of those dudes who's like a dark elf and he makes it dark.
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.720]  He makes it and he has these bombs that he throws on the ground that have a huge area of effect
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.100]  and are hard to roll away from. It's like the aphelim or whatever.
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.840]  And he just isn't real. He flies. He's a little fucking buzzy little turd.
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.280]  And just fucking I got him down to like a like a fucking pubic hair health three different times
[15:45.280 --> 15:51.800]  and he still killed me. And it's like, well, that was 10 minutes of my life. Hold on a second. You
[15:51.800 --> 15:58.960]  were loaded up. Yeah, he that was on that U-shaped map, right? You just like have to run around.
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.120]  Yeah, I remember that fight. It's pitch black and there's not a lot. I didn't have a lot of health
[16:04.060 --> 16:08.640]  and yeah, it just was doo doo. And then I did a boss today and there was nothing to it. First
[16:08.640 --> 16:13.740]  try, you know? Yeah, I think the elves, those guys are tough. Oh, Alfheim or whatever is my
[16:13.740 --> 16:17.400]  least favorite part of that game. A lot of people in the chat were saying that. Me too. Yeah. Oh,
[16:17.420 --> 16:21.520]  really? Yeah. Me too. Some interesting story beats, but I just don't like
[16:21.520 --> 16:26.340]  the look of stuff there either. Where the hell am I going? You know, one kind of interesting
[16:26.340 --> 16:34.840]  side effect I'm discovering in my in my streaming journey is that you just throw a story right out
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.620]  the fucking window. I have no idea. I couldn't tell you two things about God of War. I have no
[16:39.620 --> 16:44.400]  fun. I know I'm taking my kid to the top of the mountain and I know my wife is dead. I have picked
[16:44.400 --> 16:49.340]  up nothing else in 12 hours of gameplay. Is it because you're trying to be entertaining instead
[16:49.340 --> 16:54.760]  I'm like reading the chat and like thinking about answers and they're fucking having a boring
[16:54.760 --> 16:58.540]  conversation where the dad's like, stop asking questions. And I'm like, well, I'm never going
[16:58.540 --> 17:02.260]  to fucking learn answers then because I'm not allowed to ask questions. So you're sure not.
[17:02.660 --> 17:06.560]  But then, you know, I don't listen anyway. So have you met other bloke yet?
[17:08.760 --> 17:15.540]  Other bloke? Well, I don't know what you're saying. I'm trying to ask you a question without
[17:16.520 --> 17:22.220]  spoiling it. Yeah, I don't think so. That was just you. And is it just you and the boy? Yeah,
[17:22.260 --> 17:27.300]  it's just me and boy. We hung out with a fairy lady for a while who was pretty hot, who I thought
[17:27.300 --> 17:33.420]  maybe maybe there could be something there after a respectful period of mourning. But I don't get
[17:33.420 --> 17:38.420]  the impression it's going anywhere. Was that Freya? Yeah, maybe. I don't know. Oh, I don't
[17:38.420 --> 17:41.640]  think we know the name of who it is yet. I'm not trying to learn her life history. Was that
[17:42.560 --> 17:46.660]  lovely woman? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hello.
[17:49.100 --> 17:53.380]  All right. Learning some things. I think it's bollocks that it's giving you a prompt.
[17:53.860 --> 18:00.160]  I think so too. So what is that prompt telling you to do? It's like if you don't do that,
[18:00.220 --> 18:04.500]  he'll just kill you. What was that? Just hit square a bunch? Yeah, hit square.
[18:05.580 --> 18:09.180]  Oh, get up. Were you moving it around or were you just smashing square?
[18:10.340 --> 18:15.300]  Uh, I was smashing it. Okay. There was no rhythm to it or anything? You weren't trying to match it or?
[18:15.820 --> 18:23.220]  Oh, no, not at all. If you gave me a human and snow and told me to stamp their head into pieces,
[18:23.380 --> 18:27.740]  I don't, I think you could give me a hundred stamps and I wouldn't be able to do it. You don't think
[18:27.740 --> 18:32.120]  you could get through the snow pretty quickly? Shit. It's gonna be really hard to pop a head
[18:32.120 --> 18:39.160]  like that. Oh, okay. Maybe they're weakened heads due to the... I'm gonna guess the deterioration
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.020]  and like mold and mildew and stuff. They're probably pretty spongy.
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.700]  Which is honestly where a lot of zombie lore falls apart for me,
[18:50.760 --> 18:54.760]  because I feel like the zombie problem solves itself if you wait it out.
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.560]  Yeah, 28 weeks or days later did that. Did they? Yeah, like they're gonna, they're gonna
[19:01.140 --> 19:05.500]  deteriorate. Oh, they're not zombies. They're not alive. They're not nourishing the body or the
[19:05.500 --> 19:14.300]  skin so it can't grow or heal or it can only deteriorate and just they should fall apart
[19:14.300 --> 19:20.820]  about as fast as a dead person would fall apart. They should be soup in like eight years. Yeah.
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.940]  The Walking Dead really, because that one extends forever, but I don't, I don't know how they keep
[19:26.940 --> 19:31.880]  explaining it. They just continue to be very strong somehow. Yeah, it's like magic. It's stupid.
[19:33.820 --> 19:37.580]  Yeah, 28 days later did it right. They're not technically zombies, but they're infected with
[19:37.580 --> 19:41.840]  that rage virus. And then after a certain amount of time, they just starve to death. Yeah.
[19:47.340 --> 19:52.440]  Good hit. Thank you. That was scary. That's the other thing. I can't waste any bullets.
[19:53.720 --> 20:00.260]  Can you go dig that one out? No, I wish. They haven't, they haven't given me that level of
[20:00.260 --> 20:03.920]  inventory yet. Oh, I can. Do you think a zombie produces heat?
[20:05.760 --> 20:14.020]  No. Is it stone cold? I would think so. I mean, maybe friction, uh, like the heat from friction
[20:14.020 --> 20:20.280]  or movement, but they're not pumping blood. They're probably cold, right? The body itself.
[20:20.520 --> 20:26.960]  Otherwise, I imagine a zombie would be room temperature. Like some of my plans.
[20:29.020 --> 20:33.060]  I was thinking maybe just keep a few heads and just use them to like heat a room up.
[20:34.800 --> 20:38.900]  Or like put one in my backpack and maybe you can warm me in the snow.
[20:39.260 --> 20:44.280]  Maybe you could microwave them and then they would stay, they would stay warm longer, like 10,
[20:44.380 --> 20:50.520]  10 hours. That would smell great. Like those gel packs you get, put them in the microwave for 30
[20:50.520 --> 20:55.900]  seconds. Do you know exactly what you're doing, Nick? Like you've, you've, you played this so much,
[20:55.900 --> 21:02.460]  you know it all? Uh, I have a vague recollection of this. Oh, that doesn't sound encouraging.
[21:03.200 --> 21:06.520]  Yeah. So normally you'd be able to listen and see where this zombie is based on
[21:06.520 --> 21:08.640]  that little sound thing I was telling you about earlier.
[21:11.040 --> 21:13.680]  Let's see, do I have to hold that or can I just, okay.
[21:15.920 --> 21:19.980]  I would say that was a risky move. The mouth was pretty close there. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like
[21:19.980 --> 21:24.800]  how they do this. They grab them around the neck a lot of times and that's just so close to
[21:24.800 --> 21:27.080]  mouth territory. Yeah. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.
[21:30.460 --> 21:35.220]  Where? Nope, nothing here. Because you don't even know what state the jaw is in. Like if the bottom
[21:35.220 --> 21:39.560]  piece of, if the jaw's gone, then the teeth are just right there. Yeah, they could just,
[21:39.780 --> 21:45.600]  mmm, that's a great point, Gav. They could just clip you. Ooh, wow. I can't believe I've found
[21:45.600 --> 21:50.820]  four bullets. That's insane. That's more than I found like in the entire first game on this mode.
[21:52.060 --> 21:55.560]  What if you, uh, get all the way through? What's that thing next to the bog? You better go back
[21:55.560 --> 21:59.260]  and check. There's a thing next to the bog? What if we get all the way through today and you look
[21:59.260 --> 22:05.940]  and find out you weren't on the hard difficulty after all? It'd reset. Oh. It was just a toilet
[22:05.940 --> 22:14.520]  rolls holder. Hey, look! Oh? Look, Andrew's here. He's been fishing. Oh, look, and a tub. Look,
[22:14.640 --> 22:20.800]  tall back. Dude, Andrew would love that tub. He would love this tub. We should
[22:20.800 --> 22:26.800]  do a top ten tubs in gaming. Can we do toilets in gaming? We did top ten grossest toilets in
[22:26.800 --> 22:33.300]  gaming. Yeah. That one's pretty rank, yeah. But look at this. Next to this toilet
[22:34.340 --> 22:41.080]  is another toilet for some reason. Oh, yeah. That's only a half bath and it's weird because
[22:41.080 --> 22:50.780]  it has so much space to be more. Yeah, that's an odd choice. This is not a powder room. This
[22:51.220 --> 22:54.320]  I'm a little upset. Okay, there's one guy. Is there two in here?
[22:57.540 --> 23:00.820]  Oh, he's moving. Shit. Do you only have one share?
[23:02.580 --> 23:06.360]  What, at home? Yeah. No, I have two, but they're not that close.
[23:06.680 --> 23:09.780]  Yeah, they don't share a wall. Yeah, certainly not.
[23:11.880 --> 23:17.560]  Oh, balls. Don't see me. If it was just like where if they were bedrooms on the other two sides,
[23:17.560 --> 23:23.080]  you know, but there weren't. Yeah, or like it was a Jack and Jill bathroom. And then,
[23:23.200 --> 23:26.580]  you know, there was another bathroom down the hall. Another bullet. What is happening?
[23:26.720 --> 23:29.960]  You're playing on easy. I think I might be. That's why you're still alive.
[23:32.060 --> 23:35.740]  No, but I'd be able to see my health and everything. And it also told me how many
[23:35.740 --> 23:40.080]  bullets I actually have. I don't know how many I have right now. What do you think?
[23:40.580 --> 23:45.460]  How many times do you think you'll die? Oh, dude, it's gonna be countless. Countless.
[23:46.090 --> 23:58.800]  I think I was pretty high. When I did the hospital part of the of the previous game,
[23:58.920 --> 24:05.980]  I must have died in the first playthrough 20 times. The first night, the first night I tried
[24:05.980 --> 24:10.040]  it. I stopped the first time and then reloaded it. And when I did it again, it probably took
[24:10.040 --> 24:17.640]  me another 20 to 30 times. Jeez, it was awful. Oh, they've got the parking tennis ball. Did
[24:17.640 --> 24:25.900]  you see that? Yeah. That was a nice touch. Do you have to fight like animals at all?
[24:31.730 --> 24:35.990]  Oh, I don't think so. Oh, I should have paid attention. That's another thing I don't like
[24:35.990 --> 24:41.010]  in like zombie games. The animals would be feral and wild. There'd be roaming packs of
[24:41.010 --> 24:46.990]  dogs everywhere. It'd be like Detroit in 2010. You would encounter it more often than not.
[24:48.870 --> 24:53.310]  Like in Walking Dead, the video game, Clementine got her finger bit off that way.
[24:55.050 --> 25:00.610]  By a dog? Yeah. I think it was Clementine. Might have been one of the other characters,
[25:00.690 --> 25:13.720]  but I think it was. Okay, now we flash back to Ellie. Pretty river.
[25:17.760 --> 25:19.640]  Can I skip this? It seems cinematic.
[25:23.630 --> 25:28.930]  Andrew's in the chat saying bad things about you, Nick. What? Andrew? No, he's not. He's
[25:28.930 --> 25:33.970]  saying that we're bad at calling it out, but he's thanking the audience for all their support. Oh,
[25:34.450 --> 25:38.350]  yeah. Thank you for your support and for being here and watching us and catching this later.
[25:38.850 --> 25:44.470]  Yeah. I'm not seeing any alerts. How do we know what to pull out? This way. I don't know how any
[25:44.470 --> 26:03.850]  of this stuff works yet. I'm so stupid. Alright, horsey time. There is an open... Gavin, you said
[26:03.850 --> 26:09.970]  you played this, right? Yeah. Did you really like the open world section that they have in this
[26:09.970 --> 26:21.590]  game? There's a reason I didn't like it. Oh, I think mostly I liked it. Can I complain about
[26:21.590 --> 26:26.070]  that for a second? Sure. I've never seen it. I don't know what it's about. I don't know how good
[26:26.070 --> 26:31.990]  it is, but I hate it. And I'll tell you why. If you want to make an open world game, make a fucking
[26:31.990 --> 26:37.730]  open world game. But these pseudo open world elements they throw in, like in Halo... was it
[26:37.730 --> 26:42.930]  Halo 5 that they did that? There are like two levels where you just walk around and talk to people
[26:42.930 --> 26:45.810]  and it's supposed to give you the impression of it being open world, but it's not really.
[26:46.110 --> 26:51.130]  And then Gears of War 5 has an element of that too, I believe. We haven't gotten there yet.
[26:51.510 --> 26:57.030]  Or maybe it's not 5, maybe it's the... when you're in the vehicle. The skiff? Yeah. Yeah, that was 5.
[26:57.230 --> 27:04.790]  It always just comes across as half-assed. It is an interesting blend. And it's kind of
[27:04.790 --> 27:07.890]  disappointing sometimes when you're like, oh, I really like how that played. And then it's like,
[27:07.930 --> 27:12.810]  oh, well, that that section's done. Yeah. And it's never coming back. Yeah, right. Or it's really
[27:12.810 --> 27:15.890]  good. And then you're like, oh, that would have been so much better if the game was just like
[27:15.890 --> 27:20.870]  this, but it's not. So now I just know that I could have had a better game experience. Yeah.
[27:21.230 --> 27:24.970]  And you took it back away from me. Yeah. And then you got some open world where it's like,
[27:24.990 --> 27:30.330]  it's open world, but you can't get to all of it at the beginning. Like GTA 4. Geoff's just too old.
[27:30.330 --> 27:34.930]  I am too old, but that's not that has nothing to do with this. I'm right on this one. Somebody
[27:34.930 --> 27:38.270]  said the last Wolfenstein did that. That's right. It did. It's annoying.
[27:40.130 --> 27:42.670]  Oh, I entered this conversation. Now I'm looking at the fucking chat.
[27:43.430 --> 27:48.430]  Oh, thank you, Mac Wilson. He's a first time chatter. This is his first time chatting with us.
[27:48.750 --> 27:53.430]  Wow. Thanks for chatting. I've learned that the chat does that. It tells you.
[27:53.810 --> 27:57.230]  Puts a little star next to a guy. Congrats on your comment leaver status.
[27:57.230 --> 28:08.560]  Shout out if you've got a star next to your guy. What are we doing? Let me skip. Okay.
[28:11.420 --> 28:17.620]  We're in that in between recording phase where we've taken a week break and we have no episode
[28:17.620 --> 28:23.380]  recorded. Oh yeah. So we don't have next week's episode recorded. We have not made it yet.
[28:24.340 --> 28:29.740]  Everything we've done is out. Well, with gameplay. With gameplay. Oh,
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.260]  not with gameplay. Exception. Every month's ahead on that. Yeah.
[28:37.680 --> 28:44.880]  Okay, here we go. Do you have a lot to talk about? I got some stuff. I got a bunch of
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.520]  unimportant stuff, but I would like to tell one specific story of something that happened to me
[28:49.520 --> 28:56.840]  on my walk last week that I think is the funniest fucking thing. Just, this is the most surreal
[28:56.840 --> 29:02.660]  experience taking a walk in my neighborhood. Are you a walk guy now? Like a legs guy instead of a
[29:02.660 --> 29:08.720]  bike guy? No, I'm a bike guy, but I just felt like taking a walk. Did you take the dog? That's
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.860]  kind of like a dog activity. Usually I take the dog for about three walks a day, but I just the
[29:13.860 --> 29:18.820]  other day it was like sunset and I, uh, I don't remember why, like nobody was home and I didn't
[29:18.820 --> 29:23.640]  want to, I just didn't feel like going to my room in my house and I, uh, I didn't want to go to the
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.700]  process of like pulling my bag out and everything. So I just thought I'll just walk around for a
[29:26.700 --> 29:30.260]  little bit. I didn't even have my headphones. If I had my headphones on, I wouldn't have a story.
[29:33.500 --> 29:39.220]  Interesting. Rip the bong. I know. Like, oh, what's this for?
[29:41.500 --> 29:50.920]  Rip the bong? GTA. Uh, I, so I went to, I went to a trivia this week, like hosted at a bar.
[29:51.480 --> 29:57.080]  And, uh, did you really? Yeah. I, I sometimes I'll go on, there's like a Tuesday night one.
[29:57.200 --> 30:02.220]  Is it like geeks who drink kind of thing or? I think it's actually hosted just by the venue.
[30:02.220 --> 30:06.560]  Like that particular restaurant has their own. Oh, okay. And yeah, so it's pretty good. Like
[30:06.560 --> 30:12.000]  they do a typical Tuesday one and there's always one group that's, uh, that wins. They always win.
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.100]  They're, they're always at the top and we're close, but we never, you know, we never, we never
[30:16.100 --> 30:21.940]  win, but it reminded me of a story, uh, from when I was back in radio that we had this, uh,
[30:22.040 --> 30:26.120]  advertise, we had this one group that advertised with us who were looking to do.
[30:27.820 --> 30:32.900]  To set up their own trivia night. And they thought that it would get a lot of folks there,
[30:32.900 --> 30:37.920]  but they, they kind of went about advertising it the wrong way and they were, they asked me to
[30:37.920 --> 30:43.740]  host it. So I said, yeah, sure. I'll host it. I I'm, I'm up and coming in radio. Why not? This'll
[30:43.740 --> 30:48.720]  be great. But it was all sports trivia. But the problem is, is nobody was going to write it. I
[30:48.720 --> 30:57.100]  had to write all my own questions. Uh, I recorded the ads for it and they ran very infrequently and
[30:57.100 --> 31:03.600]  ran on our AM station, which had a very poor signal and the place was called tailgaters. It's
[31:03.600 --> 31:11.580]  gone now. Um, but the first night I went there, there were two teams and one of them was fielded
[31:11.580 --> 31:19.280]  by the promotion staff of the radio station. And so it's me on stage talking into a mic that I set
[31:19.280 --> 31:28.320]  up asking questions to people I work with and one other group of people who were just there for a
[31:28.320 --> 31:34.760]  meal. Oh dear. Oh, and that happened and we, and they, that was not the only time they did. They
[31:34.760 --> 31:43.940]  had a couple others. Uh, and that was no, the turnout never really improved. I would say,
[31:44.480 --> 31:49.020]  I would say maybe max, I had four tables. How many times did you do it?
[31:50.300 --> 32:00.640]  Four. Oh, we should have a time. Did you get numb to it? Uh, yeah. Did you have to psych yourself
[32:00.640 --> 32:04.560]  up every day going like, this is, today's the day it's people are going to show up today. This week
[32:04.560 --> 32:08.140]  is going to be the good week. There's so many teams that you go and you'd be like, oh fuck,
[32:08.140 --> 32:12.120]  it's worse than last. That's, that's certainly what the ad exec was thinking. This is it. This
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.960]  is the week. This is the week. Maybe we should, we got to make the, we got to make it count.
[32:14.960 --> 32:19.980]  We should do redemption trivia where you can post your own questions, but do it here on Twitch
[32:19.980 --> 32:26.040]  and there'll be loads of people playing. Oh, that's an amazing idea. Wow. Does anyone want
[32:26.040 --> 32:33.620]  to help me write those? No, Nick, you got to set your mic up. Oh God, I'm flashing back. I'm
[32:33.620 --> 32:39.960]  flashing back. Uh, I just remember there was a coworker of mine who was off and he would,
[32:40.060 --> 32:43.240]  he would come by to support each time, but he'd always come up with these really crass names.
[32:43.240 --> 32:49.740]  And so he like the one time his name was, uh, my Dixie and then wrecked.
[32:50.640 --> 32:56.940]  So when you read it out loud, it was my Dix erect. And I just remember reading that to an empty bar
[32:57.720 --> 33:03.980]  and then like two older folks sitting at the bar, like glancing at me with
[33:03.980 --> 33:07.640]  malice every time I said it. Oh, do you think that was rock bottom?
[33:10.720 --> 33:13.780]  It was as close as you can get without it actually being, I feel like.
[33:15.540 --> 33:18.900]  I wish you could say yes. Cause if it's not, that means there's worse ahead.
[33:20.240 --> 33:29.440]  Oh shit. Uh, that's really bad, dude, but you survived it. And now what an amazing story you
[33:29.440 --> 33:35.200]  could tell for the rest of your life. Yeah, it's pretty horrific, man. They really give you tons
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.320]  of bullets on easy mode, huh? Man, I don't know what's happening. This is that reminds me of a,
[33:42.460 --> 33:47.040]  I think I probably told this on the RT podcast years ago, but that reminds me of, uh, of one
[33:47.040 --> 33:51.560]  of the times I was on tour back when I used to tour with that, that, uh, band catch me too, uh,
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.660]  in the nineties. And, uh, we were in Albuquerque. I want to say Albuquerque, New Mexico and shows
[33:57.660 --> 34:02.960]  would be like four, 400 kids would show up or four kids would show up and you just never knew
[34:02.960 --> 34:06.460]  what it was going to be, you know, cause they were kind of a major band at the time, but
[34:06.460 --> 34:11.500]  you just like some markets, it just, they just didn't hit or the promotion was bad or it was
[34:11.500 --> 34:18.300]  like a ramshackle kind of tour. And, uh, so we went to this place in Albuquerque and there was
[34:18.300 --> 34:22.480]  a local Scott punk band that opened up before us of high school kids, like literally high school
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.880]  kids. They were cute. It was like a cute little thing. And they probably brought 30 people to
[34:27.880 --> 34:32.540]  the show. And so we were like, Oh, that's kind of, kind of sucks. But at least there's a plan
[34:32.540 --> 34:36.440]  to somebody. And, uh, cause I think they had just played a show to nobody, like literally zero
[34:36.440 --> 34:43.420]  people, like three or four days before. And, uh, and as soon as that high school band finished,
[34:43.640 --> 34:48.260]  they packed up and all of their friends left with them. And it was just their friends that were
[34:48.260 --> 34:57.080]  there. And one kid stayed from the band. One kid stayed and watched the whole show. And I was
[34:57.080 --> 35:01.940]  selling t-shirts and stuff. Then I was already right. So like three quarters of the way through
[35:01.940 --> 35:08.360]  the show, it was literally just me with a merch full of booth and him, and then like a bartender
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.040]  back somewhere. And then the band plan. And so about three quarters of the way through the show,
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.380]  I walked over to him and I said, Hey man, I just wanted to say, I really appreciate you sticking
[35:16.380 --> 35:21.580]  around to check the guys out. And it means a lot to us. And so if you want, I'll give you like any
[35:21.580 --> 35:24.720]  of the merch, I'll give you a huge discount. I'll give you a CD for like five bucks, whatever you
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.040]  want. And he looked at me and he goes, I didn't stay to see you. I don't want to see you. My
[35:29.040 --> 35:33.360]  friends left me and my mom's at work and I have to stay here until somebody can come get me. And I
[35:33.360 --> 35:42.600]  was like, Oh, Oh. And I just walked away. And, uh, and then he just fucking stood there. And I
[35:42.600 --> 35:46.020]  realized that he was, he just had his arms folded in front like watching. I realized he wasn't just
[35:46.020 --> 35:49.960]  trying to be like a tough guy at a show. He was just moping because his friends left him.
[35:49.960 --> 35:54.700]  Oh, that's so sad.
[35:57.140 --> 36:03.140]  There's a lot of people in the chat writing merch full of booth. Is that what you said?
[36:03.780 --> 36:06.680]  Oh, booth full of merch maybe? Merch booth.
[36:07.080 --> 36:11.900]  I like how much stuff just gets by me. I'm glad there's hundreds of other people here.
[36:12.220 --> 36:12.960]  I love the flood.
[36:16.280 --> 36:20.400]  We have another good, uh, I just proofed it today. We did a sausage talk and there's
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.540]  another good flub in that. Oh, who's flub is it? Is it the end? Right at the end.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.800]  Yeah. Who is it? Someone who was maybe trying to read out a certain domain at the end.
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.200]  I have fucked it up every stream since I started.
[36:37.960 --> 36:41.100]  You nailed it in episode 11. You probably got, I did, you probably got
[36:41.100 --> 36:48.060]  six or seven flubs from me in my right, in my Geoff streams already. I fucking hate it.
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.820]  Do you have the VODs of those? Yeah, I downloaded them all. I was, uh, I wanted to talk to you
[36:52.820 --> 36:55.600]  about that. Uh, we were talking about what to do with them yesterday and I wanted to
[36:55.600 --> 37:01.240]  get your opinion because you weren't around to weigh in. Oh, yeah. I like the idea.
[37:04.590 --> 37:09.810]  Open the door. Uh oh. Oh, I heard it too. Let's take a look.
[37:15.360 --> 37:22.560]  Loading. Loading. Loading times. Uh oh. Hit him with the bottle. Jab it in his throat.
[37:22.560 --> 37:28.320]  Why is it telling me this? Quick though, R2. Strike. There you go. Oh, there you go.
[37:29.060 --> 37:34.900]  That felt like too easy. You can't tell me that shit. Yeah. I was about to whip out the gun.
[37:35.180 --> 37:38.420]  How do you see what level you are or what difficulty you're playing?
[37:39.160 --> 37:42.000]  Oh, you know what I can do? I can save it and take a look at what it...
[37:44.120 --> 37:51.240]  ...looks like on load. Okay, it says grounded. Okay. Sweet. All right. We're right. We got it.
[37:51.440 --> 37:58.300]  We got it. How'd that runner get in here? Got it. Uh. Yeah. My other problem with games like this
[37:58.300 --> 38:02.620]  too is, Geoff, like you were saying, just, uh, we were talking about it before the stream where we
[38:02.620 --> 38:10.280]  just have to check every nook and cranny. Oh, yeah. But it pays off. Especially on this mode.
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.260]  Where the hell am I going? Have you ever checked just a nook or just a cranny?
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.300]  Nah, you can't check one without the other. They go hand in hand, don't they? Yeah. It's a tandem deal.
[38:24.780 --> 38:31.260]  I feel like I do use nook way more than I use cranny. Well, you can't use cranny without
[38:31.260 --> 38:37.220]  using nook. You can't just say cranny. That's weird. Yeah. That sounds very weird. Like I've
[38:37.220 --> 38:44.280]  just lost my keys in a cranny. Yeah. And then maybe sometimes you mention that you like,
[38:44.380 --> 38:48.580]  that's a cool book nook or something. But you never say like, check out that cranny.
[38:49.220 --> 38:55.040]  Yeah. There's always like a reading nook or like a cozy little... but never a cozy little cranny.
[38:55.600 --> 39:03.640]  Yeah. No, because cranny is too crose to grant. Oh my God. Yeah, everybody spam that in the chat.
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.840]  Nick said crose. Nick said crose. Let's all type that.
[39:11.100 --> 39:19.040]  Okay. Nice and easy. Quiet. Oh, let's go sleep now. Go sleep now.
[39:20.300 --> 39:23.340]  This is the longest killing enemy. Oh, there's another guy. Oh shit.
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.000]  There's two of them. Oh crap. Wow. I got really lucky there, didn't I?
[39:30.440 --> 39:33.620]  How do I do this without the one spotting me?
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.020]  Hey, that's my last name.
[39:39.860 --> 39:42.700]  Wow. I looked everywhere and not right in front of me.
[39:45.080 --> 39:47.680]  Dina, if you want to kill the other one, that would be swell.
[39:48.160 --> 39:53.340]  Will she? There she goes. Yes, she will. That's nice of her. Eric just went live trying to steal
[39:53.340 --> 39:58.660]  viewers. Did he really? What? Eric's live? Is he really? Are you for real?
[40:00.780 --> 40:04.640]  Why would he do that? Why would he do that? Do you think he got that game
[40:04.640 --> 40:10.880]  to work with his friend finally? Well, I don't know. I mean, he may be live,
[40:11.020 --> 40:16.900]  but I bet he's not talking about crannies. Not yet. Go spam cranny in Eric's chat.
[40:20.340 --> 40:24.400]  That son of a bitch. Why would he do that to us? Why? Why would he do that to us?
[40:24.540 --> 40:30.400]  He knows how important today is to Nick. Yeah. This is Nick's big chance. Yeah,
[40:30.400 --> 40:35.880]  this is Nick's big day. It all hinges on today. Does Eric not realize that if Nick messes this up,
[40:36.240 --> 40:38.520]  we're not... we're changing the password to Twitch?
[40:51.920 --> 40:53.680]  All right, up you go.
[40:53.680 --> 41:01.620]  All right, go ahead. Prince Charming says he is the CEO. What can you guys do? He's the president.
[41:01.760 --> 41:07.700]  He's not the CEO. Hey, Old Coles did something. He gifted five tier one subs to the community.
[41:07.920 --> 41:14.260]  I think that... thank you for that. Thanks, Old Coles. Thanks, Old Coles. See, we called it out.
[41:14.460 --> 41:18.640]  I don't know what it is, but I called it out. I return Amazon stuff to you all the time.
[41:19.120 --> 41:27.040]  Old Coles? Old Coles. It's a lot easier than UPS these days.
[41:28.040 --> 41:33.300]  Oh, I prefer New Coles. Agree. Hey, Andrew, what's going on in Eric's chat? Can you report back?
[41:33.760 --> 41:38.460]  Can you be an operative? Can you see? Is he doing some wrestling shit? Or is... if that
[41:38.460 --> 41:44.240]  motherfucker is 100% eating right now? Well, he'd be doing it without me, son of a bitch.
[41:44.240 --> 41:49.540]  That's what I'm saying. You can't do it without Nick. Especially on a day that's so important to Nick.
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.080]  I am eating. You can't stress that enough. What the f...
[41:54.080 --> 42:00.860]  All right, here we go. He's claiming a scheduling mix-up. I mean... Interesting. Nick's been talking
[42:00.860 --> 42:05.560]  about this for a while. All right, next time Eric does his wrestling shit, all four of us need to
[42:05.560 --> 42:12.020]  go live on four different channels. Oh, yes. I love it. That'll teach him, son of a bitch.
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.980]  Somebody said he's playing Rady Boy. What? Not a chance in hell.
[42:18.700 --> 42:24.740]  Y'all did not like that game. I thought it was cute. I thought it was fine. It's just a headache...
[42:27.620 --> 42:29.440]  game. I feel like that's most games.
[42:32.420 --> 42:40.400]  Man, I was playing Warzone the other day, and uh... I've probably played like 150 games, maybe?
[42:41.060 --> 42:44.560]  But there's like a whole thing that happened I'd never seen before. Someone set off a nuke.
[42:45.220 --> 42:49.840]  What? Have you seen that before? No! You can do that? Yeah, I guess if you...
[42:51.640 --> 42:55.620]  It was just like a whole... Like, it changed the entire game. Like, people were collecting
[42:55.620 --> 43:00.340]  parts for a nuke, and then they built it. And then everyone left in the game had to like run
[43:00.340 --> 43:05.840]  to defuse it. And there were just people piling into this central point. It's crazy.
[43:06.600 --> 43:09.120]  Did you stand in the radius and die instantly, like in another game?
[43:09.900 --> 43:13.560]  Yeah, I got killed by the... He plays Warzone. Yeah, was Burndog there?
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.260]  I actually was dead already, so I just spectated the whole thing. Oh.
[43:19.180 --> 43:23.140]  I want to do a spectator stream like we were talking about at some point a couple weeks ago,
[43:23.240 --> 43:29.980]  where I just go in and die immediately, and then we just watch the stream as it goes from player
[43:29.980 --> 43:36.400]  to player as they die. Yeah, it's a lot of fun to do. It's like watching a sport. An eSport.
[43:36.740 --> 43:40.860]  And you always win. That's true. An eSport, if you will.
[43:42.860 --> 43:48.840]  I'm not going to heal, what the fuck? Why would I waste it? It's going to make me do it, isn't it?
[43:51.240 --> 43:53.960]  I think Nick's going to go this whole stream without getting killed.
[43:54.920 --> 43:57.680]  Looking pretty good. Wait till this next room.
[43:58.200 --> 44:00.320]  I see spores in there. Warzone bingo.
[44:00.660 --> 44:02.080]  Masks on. Got it.
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.780]  We should play Warzone again. Oh, Philly's lost, cool. Why do we have to have masks on?
[44:08.940 --> 44:13.280]  Oh, the spores. Will they make us bad if we breathe it?
[44:13.660 --> 44:15.900]  They will kill us. They won't kill Ellie because she's immune.
[44:16.280 --> 44:19.900]  But they don't want anyone else to know that she's immune.
[44:26.040 --> 44:26.920]  Fungus. Fungus.
[44:27.040 --> 44:29.920]  Did you ever watch the Cordyceps video from Planet Earth?
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.360]  Yeah, it's super creepy. No?
[44:32.480 --> 44:35.220]  It's really cool. It infects...
[44:35.960 --> 44:39.420]  Well, there's like different species for different species of animal,
[44:39.580 --> 44:44.940]  but they show ants and the fungus like gets in the ant and it causes the ant to...
[44:45.820 --> 44:49.080]  It just starts acting strange and then starts climbing really high.
[44:49.200 --> 44:52.300]  And then it dies while grabbing onto something.
[44:52.560 --> 44:56.800]  And then a big fungal spore starts growing out of its head.
[44:58.280 --> 45:01.540]  And then it pops and releases more spores.
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.720]  That... Doesn't it try to take it back to the nest in some instances too?
[45:05.400 --> 45:09.480]  Yeah, it shows like the other ants know that the ant is ruined.
[45:09.760 --> 45:12.820]  So they start just chucking all the infected ants out.
[45:13.480 --> 45:16.320]  Okay, combo is the date my good boy got Employee of the Month.
[45:16.460 --> 45:17.720]  All right, I'm assuming that's a dog.
[45:18.500 --> 45:22.140]  That doesn't sound cool at all. That sounds like the opposite of cool.
[45:23.980 --> 45:26.300]  It wouldn't be cool if it happened to humans like in this game.
[45:27.700 --> 45:30.640]  There was a dog that was Employee of the Month. Bottom left.
[45:33.100 --> 45:34.760]  So July 2013.
[45:38.220 --> 45:42.340]  Oh yeah, the show also... Okay, so...
[45:44.920 --> 45:45.320]  July...
[45:46.740 --> 45:47.140]  20...
[45:48.280 --> 45:49.280]  Maybe this is right.
[45:50.200 --> 45:54.260]  Would we ever consider a condiment draft? Cheese Crocs asks.
[45:55.140 --> 45:56.220]  We've talked about it actually.
[45:57.160 --> 45:59.180]  I have it on the list. I don't know if it's something we'll do.
[45:59.740 --> 46:02.080]  These guys are all... These guys get... They get weird about condiments.
[46:05.980 --> 46:08.740]  I don't know. I start to feel a little ganged up on around them.
[46:08.860 --> 46:10.840]  They get... I don't know if I want to do a condiment draft.
[46:10.840 --> 46:11.940]  They get strange opinions.
[46:12.980 --> 46:16.060]  Our last bunch of drafts have been pretty heated.
[46:17.100 --> 46:17.500]  Yeah.
[46:17.980 --> 46:18.640]  What are you talking about?
[46:19.560 --> 46:20.660]  I don't know, Americano.
[46:23.080 --> 46:25.680]  What are you talking about? You took drip coffee.
[46:26.600 --> 46:26.900]  It's just coffee.
[46:26.900 --> 46:28.180]  Did I say drip coffee?
[46:28.760 --> 46:30.240]  Did I say drip coffee?
[46:30.760 --> 46:34.100]  No, but when I hear coffee, it's drip coffee.
[46:36.280 --> 46:37.640]  But they're different.
[46:40.060 --> 46:44.040]  Yeah, Gunkatus knows. Coffee, tea with coffee. Lemonade, tea with lemonade. Exactly.
[46:46.340 --> 46:47.000]  They're drinks.
[46:47.500 --> 46:53.060]  It's like, I'll draft Steph Curry. Oh, cool. I'll draft Steph Curry with a hat.
[46:53.340 --> 46:54.160]  Doesn't make any sense.
[46:54.880 --> 46:57.160]  You'll draft Seth Curry, his brother.
[46:58.100 --> 46:59.740]  No, it's more like the hat.
[46:59.740 --> 47:03.820]  It's like, you get home team Steph Curry, and I'll draft away team Steph Curry.
[47:03.960 --> 47:04.980]  Yeah, a lot of bollocks.
[47:05.100 --> 47:05.280]  All right.
[47:06.500 --> 47:07.520]  Nah, it's different.
[47:09.100 --> 47:09.780]  It's different.
[47:13.540 --> 47:15.960]  Some people in the chat may be guessing I'm not over it yet.
[47:19.100 --> 47:20.520]  Oh man, what are you talking about?
[47:21.640 --> 47:22.480]  Oh, fucking...
[47:22.480 --> 47:24.530]  All right, how do I...
[47:26.560 --> 47:28.140]  Okay, let's get you.
[47:32.760 --> 47:34.180]  Oh, that was lucky.
[47:35.380 --> 47:38.480]  You got your hand inside the clicker goo.
[47:39.020 --> 47:39.500]  Yeah.
[47:41.020 --> 47:42.460]  It's all right. Everything's fine.
[47:43.220 --> 47:44.780]  It seems impossible, right?
[47:46.560 --> 47:48.000]  Like to exist in this world?
[47:48.080 --> 47:49.600]  Yeah, like you wouldn't. You couldn't.
[47:49.820 --> 47:54.140]  This is like, in reality, there's just too many ways for it to go wrong.
[47:54.480 --> 47:56.340]  Like with your hand in the clicker goo.
[47:56.340 --> 47:57.480]  It's just...
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.420]  Think about how many times a day or how many times a week you stub your toe
[48:01.420 --> 48:05.720]  or bang your elbow on the corner of a desk or cut yourself shaving.
[48:05.880 --> 48:06.420]  You know what I mean?
[48:08.200 --> 48:08.800]  Oh, yeah.
[48:09.080 --> 48:11.600]  In this world, all that shit would become so much more dangerous.
[48:12.080 --> 48:14.460]  I have a paper cut on my finger right now. I'd be dead.
[48:14.960 --> 48:15.180]  Yeah.
[48:16.580 --> 48:18.760]  Oh, good. Thank God you stopped right here.
[48:21.520 --> 48:22.520]  It noticed me.
[48:22.520 --> 48:26.240]  If Gavin had coffee, then that means someone could have drafted soda.
[48:27.020 --> 48:28.300]  Soda isn't a thing.
[48:28.900 --> 48:30.180]  Soda isn't an ingredient.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.140]  What do you mean?
[48:33.620 --> 48:36.380]  Coffee's a bean. It grows. It's a bean.
[48:36.560 --> 48:38.240]  Oh, you died.
[48:41.460 --> 48:42.860]  I hit a wall. I hit a wall.
[48:42.900 --> 48:43.580]  That's the first death.
[48:48.580 --> 48:51.680]  There's no such thing as a soda, really.
[48:51.680 --> 48:54.160]  That's just a way of preparing a flavor.
[48:58.160 --> 49:00.560]  I love Gavin's hot takes.
[49:01.840 --> 49:04.000]  You know, you're not wrong, Gavin. However...
[49:04.000 --> 49:05.440]  He's not wrong. He's 100% right.
[49:05.600 --> 49:08.740]  I just love when he chooses to be passionate about a thing.
[49:13.300 --> 49:14.100]  Stop walking!
[49:14.580 --> 49:17.060]  Sometimes it's fun to pick a hill and die on it for a while.
[49:18.720 --> 49:20.960]  Oh, you gotta say it again, dude!
[49:21.680 --> 49:23.660]  You got your neck vein ripped out.
[49:25.280 --> 49:30.140]  Coffee is bean water, asks Rockstar77. That's exactly what it is.
[49:31.200 --> 49:32.610]  Well, nobody picked water, so...
[49:36.820 --> 49:40.050]  But there's so many different coffees, Gavin, that, you know...
[49:42.440 --> 49:43.200]  Americano's different.
[49:44.340 --> 49:45.440]  Yeah, it's got water in it.
[49:45.960 --> 49:46.860]  Yeah, it's got water in it.
[49:47.780 --> 49:50.440]  What you picked was either drip coffee or espresso.
[49:50.440 --> 49:51.860]  And, you know, that's different.
[49:52.100 --> 49:54.140]  You know what drip coffee has in it?
[49:54.300 --> 49:54.520]  Coffee?
[49:54.820 --> 49:55.120]  Water.
[49:58.740 --> 50:00.920]  They have, but it's different. It's prepared differently.
[50:03.560 --> 50:07.120]  It's like saying somebody picks Coke and the other person goes,
[50:07.300 --> 50:10.860]  I picked Coke with ice. It's prepared differently.
[50:13.460 --> 50:16.020]  You know, canned Coke, bottled Coke, it's different.
[50:18.320 --> 50:20.120]  The consistency. The flavor.
[50:20.860 --> 50:23.640]  I'll take Coke, but three-liter bottled Coke.
[50:23.700 --> 50:25.600]  Oh, it noticed me! God damn it!
[50:28.740 --> 50:31.940]  Sorry. I'm just trying to excuse myself on the coffee thing.
[50:32.360 --> 50:38.120]  Why don't they wear, like, old-time night helmets so they can't get bit on the neck?
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.740]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[50:39.980 --> 50:43.340]  Holiday Hippie says a paper cut wouldn't kill you just because there aren't antibiotics,
[50:43.380 --> 50:44.300]  you still have immune system.
[50:44.420 --> 50:48.840]  Yeah, I'm not talking about that. I'm just saying that when you have open wounds on your body
[50:48.840 --> 50:55.200]  and then you start wrestling with monsters, shit gets transferred. It's just, that's how it would
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.080]  happen. You'd have, like, it's like my leg right now, I have, like, seven cuts on my ankle from
[51:00.080 --> 51:02.960]  my bike, uh, pedal.
[51:03.620 --> 51:05.280]  Did they hear me? Oh, did they hear me?
[51:06.560 --> 51:09.000]  Get a little clicker goo in there and I'm fucked.
[51:11.540 --> 51:15.340]  There you go. We got it. Got that one. Now we just gotta get the other one.
[51:17.460 --> 51:18.140]  All right.
[51:19.460 --> 51:21.320]  No more, no more screwing around.
[51:21.420 --> 51:25.780]  Doodly Llama says these books are the same. They've all got covers and words.
[51:25.920 --> 51:27.920]  Kind of argument from Gavin about drinks.
[51:28.020 --> 51:33.360]  No! That would be, like, if the, if it was a draft of entertainment products.
[51:34.540 --> 51:40.840]  And not a draft of books. It was all, it was all drinks. All non-alcoholic drinks.
[51:44.620 --> 51:48.080]  Oh, it did. It noticed. It noticed. It noticed. It noticed. Keep shooting. Keep shooting.
[51:48.080 --> 51:50.940]  Shoot her! Shoot her!
[51:51.420 --> 51:52.700]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[51:52.700 --> 51:53.020]  Uh oh.
[51:53.960 --> 51:54.380]  Yeah!
[51:55.140 --> 51:55.980]  Eat dicks!
[51:57.700 --> 51:59.660]  Oh, it lived! It lived! It lived!
[52:02.000 --> 52:02.880]  Grab another bottle.
[52:04.680 --> 52:05.360]  That's for you.
[52:06.580 --> 52:07.300]  Stabby stabby!
[52:08.460 --> 52:09.500]  Oh, we did it.
[52:10.660 --> 52:11.480]  Stealthy as ever.
[52:14.700 --> 52:15.540]  Guys, we did it.
[52:16.500 --> 52:17.300]  Anyway, coffee's different.
[52:22.960 --> 52:23.840]  Ooh, rifle.
[52:28.340 --> 52:33.140]  Well, I can see the audience is as divided as the, uh, employees of the company.
[52:35.000 --> 52:41.220]  The votes, uh, the votes, uh, went in my favor a wee bit. I didn't win, but...
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.960]  I got more votes than Gavin did.
[52:48.760 --> 52:49.420]  They're different.
[52:52.120 --> 52:52.480]  Gavin!
[52:55.400 --> 52:58.060]  We still have one draft that we did from that day that hasn't come out yet.
[53:01.200 --> 53:02.180]  Are we putting that one out?
[53:02.700 --> 53:03.800]  I don't know if we can.
[53:04.380 --> 53:04.660]  Oh.
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.180]  Did you listen to it?
[53:07.380 --> 53:11.880]  Can you, can you cut, how, how, how much did you cut it down? Is it, is it okay?
[53:12.580 --> 53:18.340]  Oh, I think the main issue was that there wasn't, there wasn't a lot from you.
[53:19.500 --> 53:20.100]  At first.
[53:20.260 --> 53:22.720]  At first, but then I, I hit you with the, I hit you at the end.
[53:23.600 --> 53:27.560]  Geoff came around when I, uh, was talking about a certain spot.
[53:27.820 --> 53:30.400]  And then he was like, oh, I'm, I feel sad for you.
[53:33.260 --> 53:38.480]  General Allenby says, if you draft water, everything else uses water as an ingredient.
[53:38.780 --> 53:39.040]  So they should.
[53:39.140 --> 53:39.480]  It's true.
[53:39.480 --> 53:39.780]  Right.
[53:40.020 --> 53:47.400]  But if you ordered, if you ordered a coffee and you got a Coke, you'd say that's the wrong drink.
[53:47.820 --> 53:50.220]  You wouldn't say thanks for the water that's in it.
[53:50.460 --> 53:51.920]  They're two different drinks.
[53:52.040 --> 53:52.960]  It's not about ingredients.
[53:53.680 --> 53:57.460]  It's about, it's about sending a message.
[53:57.700 --> 53:57.760]  What?
[53:58.320 --> 54:03.100]  Uh, Gavin, if you went to a coffee shop here in America and you ordered a coffee, what would you get?
[54:06.260 --> 54:08.980]  If I wanted to, like, if I was...
[54:08.980 --> 54:11.720]  If you said, I would like a coffee, what do you get?
[54:13.420 --> 54:15.020]  Not you, but what do they give you?
[54:17.880 --> 54:19.220]  If I just ordered coffee?
[54:19.680 --> 54:24.440]  Yeah, if you said, I would like a coffee, a small coffee, what do they give you?
[54:25.500 --> 54:27.260]  Well, probably just drip coffee.
[54:28.840 --> 54:29.260]  Interesting.
[54:32.540 --> 54:35.360]  Nick has, uh, seems to have proved a point to you, Gavin,
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.940]  that he feels, uh, has, uh, given him some sort of superior advantage.
[54:40.260 --> 54:43.080]  What that advantage is, is not clear to me, but...
[54:43.080 --> 54:43.800]  Oh, what? It's not?
[54:43.940 --> 54:44.260]  No.
[54:44.860 --> 54:46.640]  But I thought it, but it's drip coffee.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.560]  What would you...
[54:47.560 --> 54:50.420]  If he ordered a coffee, he wouldn't get an Americano.
[54:51.540 --> 54:54.860]  Yeah, but if I ordered a tea, what would I get?
[54:58.070 --> 54:59.270]  What kind of story are you in?
[54:59.270 --> 55:00.510]  Careful, it's a trick question.
[55:00.970 --> 55:05.730]  Oh, things are bad, real bad.
[55:05.730 --> 55:06.390]  Okay.
[55:08.330 --> 55:10.850]  If I went to a tea shop, I, they, they...
[55:11.330 --> 55:12.630]  You know what, that's, you know what?
[55:13.410 --> 55:17.650]  Yeah, if you go to a tea shop, are you, are you gonna go in and ask for tea?
[55:19.970 --> 55:21.470]  I mean, I...
[55:25.650 --> 55:27.670]  It's an interesting question that you've got there.
[55:30.510 --> 55:32.710]  All right, let me think about it after I'm done running.
[55:41.970 --> 55:44.150]  Oh, run away, run away, run away, run away.
[55:46.670 --> 55:47.670]  You've died again.
[55:48.190 --> 55:48.810]  Yeah, I sure have.
[55:49.050 --> 55:52.470]  I'm getting tired of seeing your artery or ligament or whatever that's gonna be.
[55:52.670 --> 55:52.970]  Me too, man.
[55:53.890 --> 55:56.690]  This is the first hour of the game.
[55:58.950 --> 56:05.570]  You know what, if you went to a coffee shop and you ordered a tea, you'd probably get like a...
[56:06.370 --> 56:08.950]  What's the standard? Black tea? Earl Grey?
[56:09.930 --> 56:11.650]  Okay, so you've been given an Earl Grey.
[56:12.150 --> 56:12.550]  Right.
[56:13.810 --> 56:17.090]  So if I draft tea, I've drafted Earl Grey.
[56:17.450 --> 56:17.750]  Okay.
[56:18.150 --> 56:18.650]  Okay.
[56:18.870 --> 56:19.270]  My turn?
[56:20.270 --> 56:21.310]  Chamomile tea!
[56:22.950 --> 56:24.310]  Okay, you'll get chamomile.
[56:25.310 --> 56:25.530]  Yeah?
[56:26.010 --> 56:26.870]  It's different.
[56:29.450 --> 56:30.350]  How's it different?
[56:31.010 --> 56:31.710]  It's tea.
[56:32.510 --> 56:35.850]  It uses the plant, a tea leaf.
[56:39.470 --> 56:41.570]  What are we arguing? I don't even remember anymore.
[56:46.290 --> 56:51.510]  Different teas are just tea, the plant, with different shit added to it.
[56:52.110 --> 56:53.570]  Oh, that's an interesting point you've made.
[56:53.710 --> 56:57.170]  Yeah, like if you picked English breakfast and he picked Irish breakfast,
[56:57.350 --> 56:58.290]  then we would have had an issue.
[57:02.290 --> 57:03.230]  Oh, they're different.
[57:05.730 --> 57:07.370]  What comes in an Irish breakfast?
[57:08.350 --> 57:11.370]  I don't know, it's just next to the English breakfast on the shelf at the grocery store.
[57:13.830 --> 57:17.250]  But they are different, just by the sheer naming convention.
[57:19.590 --> 57:19.990]  Right.
[57:22.010 --> 57:23.550]  All right, well I've lost Geoff, so...
[57:25.050 --> 57:30.350]  Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler says Gavin must have been annoyed in the dog draft
[57:30.350 --> 57:33.430]  when everyone else also chose dogs.
[57:33.570 --> 57:39.110]  But I wasn't in a coffee draft! I was in a non-alcoholic beverage draft!
[57:39.910 --> 57:40.370]  Right.
[57:40.890 --> 57:43.310]  It wasn't the Starbucks draft!
[57:46.950 --> 57:48.590]  Starbucks when you draft.
[57:50.690 --> 57:51.730]  Cake pops!
[57:51.950 --> 57:52.510]  When you...
[57:52.510 --> 57:52.950]  Your turn.
[57:53.110 --> 57:53.250]  Yeah.
[57:54.270 --> 57:59.450]  When you said, uh, coffee, my brain went to, ah, drip coffee, so I'm clear there.
[57:59.930 --> 58:03.970]  Not the overarching coffee, which is why I then leaned into it more.
[58:04.250 --> 58:07.010]  When you pointed out that coffee is coffee.
[58:11.310 --> 58:15.890]  Schindler's Fist says, uh, guys, I think Gavin's thinking about getting mad.
[58:18.450 --> 58:19.570]  Schindler's Fist.
[58:24.270 --> 58:26.590]  That'd be a cool remake to do in 2024.
[58:27.250 --> 58:31.610]  Remake Schindler's List as Schindler's Fist and cast Dave Bautista in the role,
[58:31.710 --> 58:33.690]  and he just beats the shit out of Nazis.
[58:34.490 --> 58:37.230]  Just fucking pile drives Nazis all day long.
[58:38.350 --> 58:40.590]  Kind of like an Inglourious Bastard style ending.
[58:40.590 --> 58:42.370]  Yeah, but it's just Dave Bautista.
[58:45.810 --> 58:48.350]  Please shoot one of them. I don't want to waste...
[58:48.350 --> 58:50.030]  Oh wait, I can waste bullets. We're not in the...
[58:51.230 --> 58:51.530]  Uh-oh.
[58:52.070 --> 58:52.450]  All right.
[58:53.090 --> 58:54.010]  No, waste one.
[58:55.910 --> 58:56.670]  Oh shit.
[58:59.830 --> 59:00.370]  Somebody...
[59:01.550 --> 59:02.090]  Nick!
[59:03.130 --> 59:04.250]  Nick, do something!
[59:04.490 --> 59:04.910]  Oh, Nick!
[59:07.230 --> 59:09.600]  They go with the bullets you found, and now it goes...
[59:10.270 --> 59:12.210]  Run away! Everybody says run away!
[59:15.210 --> 59:16.190]  Okay, all right.
[59:17.610 --> 59:18.510]  We did it.
[59:19.530 --> 59:21.510]  Easy as can be.
[59:21.510 --> 59:23.690]  You know, Hypnotoad has a great response.
[59:23.810 --> 59:30.430]  They said, if it was an animal draft and Gavin picked dogs and then Nick picked pitbulls, it'd be a fucking issue.
[59:31.750 --> 59:34.210]  Oh, you know what? You know what? Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[59:35.310 --> 59:36.350]  But this is different.
[59:49.610 --> 59:51.430]  Gavin, we could agree to disagree.
[59:52.110 --> 59:53.110]  Oh, do we do that?
[59:53.650 --> 59:57.590]  On regulation? A regulation agree to disagreement?
[01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.010]  Yeah, regulation, uh, Americano.
[01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:03.550]  All right.
[01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.910]  Regulation, drip coffee.
[01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.210]  Next time we see each other in person, we'll shake on it.
[01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.690]  We'll agree to disagree. We'll put it to bed.
[01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:21.050]  If you had to make a resume, Gavin, and you could put one skill on it to sell yourself as you currently are, what would you pick?
[01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.910]  Here we go.
[01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:28.470]  One skill? Yeah, like one thing. You can only say one thing that you do or that you bring to the table.
[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:33.110]  You want to highlight? I can use confusion as a weapon.
[01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:41.110]  That's great. That's fantastic. That is a fucking great one. Uses confusion as a weapon. I'm like a Psyduck.
[01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:46.830]  I think mine would be excels at instigating.
[01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:47.790]  Ooh!
[01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.590]  What about you, Nick?
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:54.450]  That's a good question.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:56.690]  Team player?
[01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:03.310]  World's best God of War Ragnarok player.
[01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:10.390]  Uh, Nick, Nick is a devil dressed like a normal guy. There you go.
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:12.370]  The devil on your shoulder.
[01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.130]  Quietly insane.
[01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:15.110]  Yes.
[01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:17.110]  Plain-clothed devil.
[01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.330]  Uh, Hill Dyeron.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.120]  All right, I'm willing to bet we can get past this intro bit before we...
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.280]  How long are you streaming for?
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.900]  How long do you guys want to stream for?
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:44.900]  Uh...
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:45.940]  I'd go for a little bit longer.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.120]  Yeah. I just gotta take my dog out to piss at some point.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.580]  He's had a long day of watching me sit in front of a computer.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.280]  Feel free to use my lawn.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.740]  Are you still getting, uh, some, uh, deposits on your lawn?
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.980]  Oh, yeah, even in the rain.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.060]  Oh, even in the rain?
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.460]  Yep.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.020]  It's an absolute boss fight.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:06.800]  Dog's always gotta go.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:10.780]  Oh.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.320]  Do they clean them up? Those ones at least? Or do they abandon those?
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.220]  I've seen people try.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.680]  Oh.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.720]  I've seen people try.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.040]  Yeah, they're quite wet at that point.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.260]  What are your standards?
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:32.060]  I'm just waiting for one of these dogs to shit on my sprinkler head.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.560]  The last thing I need is a dog turd rising up and getting shot into my window.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.540]  Oh, that'd be a great slow-mo video.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:43.780]  Oh.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.880]  You should do it, but you should bring...
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.640]  You should have to come by it naturally.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.080]  So we'd have to bring in a ton of dogs and just feed them and let them shit in the yard till one of them
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.620]  eventually shits on it.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.260]  We're going to a library.
[01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:12.990]  We're taking the horsies inside.
[01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:16.810]  This all seems really cool.
[01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:17.390]  Ah!
[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:22.910]  This all seems really cool until you remember that horses just shit where they stand.
[01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:24.690]  Yeah, they do.
[01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:26.710]  Lots of shit, too.
[01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:28.230]  Lots of shit.
[01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.930]  Like a conveyor belt of shit.
[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.930]  I had a, uh...
[01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:36.050]  Speaking of shitting,
[01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:40.070]  I was going to talk about this in the podcast tomorrow, and we can, but I'll preview it here.
[01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:45.290]  Um, you know how Reddit has that, that subreddit, uh, Shower Thoughts?
[01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:46.010]  Yeah.
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:48.810]  I had a shitter thought yesterday
[01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:53.610]  and I wanted to share it with you guys. I think we should start a new thing called Shitter Thoughts.
[01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:55.050]  I realized
[01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.610]  that I use a toilet scrubber
[01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:03.170]  more times in a day than I use a fork at this point in my life.
[01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:04.710]  What?!
[01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.050]  What is your shit gripping so much?
[01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:12.870]  I have to use a toilet scrubber three times a day probably, but I don't use a fork three times a day.
[01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:14.430]  I probably use a fork twice a day.
[01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:19.670]  I use the bog brush maybe like once a month if I've had a really severe one.
[01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:22.690]  Oh man, every day of my life, multiple times a day.
[01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:27.950]  Yeah. Uh-oh. I've had, it's been real rough since Michigan. Just hasn't slowed down.
[01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.670]  Really? Yeah.
[01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:33.130]  You're, like, your diet going back to your normal?
[01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:39.450]  I'm back to normal, yeah. I don't even eat that much. It just, yeah, I'm just a mess. It's just a mess.
[01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.630]  It's a mess.
[01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.350]  Oh.
[01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.410]  Anyway. Oh shit.
[01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:48.770]  You start to think about, like, what tools are really important to you in the course of your day-to-day life, and I would...
[01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:51.490]  Toilet scrubber, definitely more useful to me than a fork.
[01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.610]  Why, why don't you try, like, misting the bowl a little bit first?
[01:04:56.750 --> 01:05:01.690]  Well, it's unfortunately how the, how I get into that trouble. As soon as I sit down and mist the bowl.
[01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:03.970]  God.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.320]  It's kind of the
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.400]  crux of the issue, man.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:20.820]  You know, I'd never considered that before, Gavin. Just spraying the toilet with a little bit of water just to help that along.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.400]  There's water in what I'm doing, trust me.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:27.560]  Well, I don't know how it's sticking, man.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:34.140]  Sometimes it just gets to parts of the bowl where the, uh, the water, the flush water doesn't get to it.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.140]  Slow torture.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.180]  What the? Is this, is this like your new toilet though? Or has this been happening in your old one?
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.440]  No, this is the new toilet. So it could just be toilet design. I think it's a bug problem.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.060]  But I mean, I, you know, I have three toilets and I use all of them, so.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.140]  Sharing the wealth.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:56.860]  Wow.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.900]  Somebody said, uh,
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.660]  Ray Dexamine said, Geoff, I just want you to know I feel your pain. I gotta be honest with you.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:12.620]  There's not a lot of pain. I'm pretty resigned to it. I'm okay with it. There's uncharted. I just beat that. That game is mediocre.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.780]  You said the first one, right? Yeah.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:15.820]  Huh.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.660]  Never played it. It's no God of War.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.860]  They had some time to
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.300]  to make that one good.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.080]  I
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.300]  was wondering when that God of War came out if it had any relation to the original.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.040]  Or if it was just a reboot and I like that it's
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:37.040]  I think it takes place after, right? Yeah, it definitely does.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:43.360]  But I was thinking, I was like, I wonder if they're just using that IP and just rebooting it all together or something or like
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.380]  starting kind of both, isn't it?
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.300]  Kind of. It's like a reboot slash
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:54.560]  you keep the history of everything else that's already happened. Which is really cool when they reference back to things.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.580]  So they probably have like one more in that world and then they'll do a different mythology or?
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.000]  Oh, that's better.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.480]  From your perspective?
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:07.640]  Or from ours.
[01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.560]  How is my perspective different from yours? I'm just saying,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.800]  the first three God of Wars were like all the same shit, right? And then they redid it as North
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.040]  Norse and there's only been two since then.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.500]  So if they did one more, that'd be another three and then they'd move on to another mythology.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.680]  Then it becomes like a gimmick though. I wouldn't be surprised if they go back to
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:30.960]  the original.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.940]  Like redesign the original?
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.480]  Or just continue the story back in the other mythology.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.520]  Oh, that's true.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.880]  Like if suddenly it was like ancient Egypt, you might be like...
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.460]  It would start to feel a little Assassin's Creed-y. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.980]  Yeah, there was a theory that that is what might happen next. I have no idea if it's true or not, but
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.300]  people were like, oh, it would make sense for him to go there.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.280]  Would it? I guess. No.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:02.580]  I don't know, maybe.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.400]  Wouldn't that just be Prince of Persia?
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.740]  I think he wasn't a god though.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.660]  He was just a prince.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.040]  Is Kratos a god?
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:20.280]  I...
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.760]  What would he be? A demigod? No, he would be a god because he was the God of War at one point.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.460]  He took Ares' spot. I don't know.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.300]  You really miss a lot when you don't like play the first trilogy.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.300]  He's also the son of Zeus. I thought he made some sort of pact with the
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:40.900]  original God of War, didn't he?
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.860]  Or a different god. He did. God as a title and a race.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.500]  Okay, cool. He's both. He's the God of War. He was dealing with titans at one point.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:52.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:59.560]  He used them to storm Olympus, didn't he? So I'm playing God of War 2018
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:00.700]  where
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.860]  my child and I are having a very father-son
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:12.420]  summer vacation where we canoe and hike up a mountain. Is that... what is he in that? Is he a demigod or a god in that?
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.800]  He's like a retired god.
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.360]  He's like a stay-at-home god. Like a stay-at-home dad god.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:28.340]  Well, that's also not his first kid. Retired god. Because I think technically he's wearing some of his first kid.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.740]  Oh, yeah, the ashes. That's why he's that that pale.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.100]  Calliope.
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:40.480]  I don't... how do I know that? Why do I know that? I didn't play the first game.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:49.600]  That was the name of his daughter. Anyway, he killed them because Ares tricked him and then to punish the other gods to punish him
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.420]  like imbued that
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:52.540]  uh
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:58.400]  their their ashes into his skin, which is why he's that pale color.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:03.400]  And then he always had the red markings. It was like part of a prophecy that
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.680]  someone with those markings would overthrow the gods. That was like a thing with him and his brother, wasn't it? Yes.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.640]  Oh, they thought it was his brother.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.680]  You think it's still good? Because his brother I think had it like as a kid and Kratos didn't. Is his brother's name Krodos?
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.840]  Is it Kratos and Krodos?
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.020]  Oh, it's Deimos. That's a missed opportunity. Yeah.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:31.900]  Come on, Krodos.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:40.620]  That's pretty fucking funny. Schlappy69. I should have expected a funny name from a person named Schlappy69.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.180]  Schlappy's on top of it. All right, here we go.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.180]  Where are they?
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:53.620]  Bro choice is pretty funny, too. Let's go that way. Oh, did I just mess up? No, I didn't.
[01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.930]  If you ignore your problems, they go away.
[01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:08.030]  Somebody said of all the scenes to skip, I don't know what that means.
[01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:16.150]  Oh, uh, they smoke a bong and make out. Oh, okay. Oh, you skipped that scene?
[01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.830]  Oh.
[01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.330]  Were we supposed to watch that scene?
[01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:24.430]  Why are you talking about the scene? The scene.
[01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:29.750]  Oh, no, that that's coming up. What are you guys referring to? The scene. What does that mean?
[01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:32.170]  There's a scene in this game. Yeah.
[01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:34.710]  Okay. Are we gonna see it today?
[01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:38.130]  Oh, uh, it depends on how well this next part goes.
[01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.990]  Oh, shit. Oh, almost done. Uh, oh.
[01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.850]  Wow, I am untouched through here.
[01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:56.810]  That way. Keep up the good work, Ellie. Is that your name? This is, uh, Abby. Abby. Abby.
[01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:06.550]  Uh-oh. A lot of zombies. Loads of zombies. You'd think the cold weather would slow them down.
[01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:13.950]  See, I, you had the internal body heat, which keeps you from freezing, but they would just, once again,
[01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:19.110]  probably just freeze right up, turn hard. Oh, no. I lost something off my pack.
[01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:24.130]  What was that? Was that a sock or something or a rag? Yeah. Oh, maybe like a, uh, uh, a beanie.
[01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:31.870]  You need to hit X or square, man. Yeah. Don't hit X. That guy always made out with you.
[01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:42.110]  All right, thanks, Joel and Tommy. That's Joel and Tommy. Wow, they're brothers.
[01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:51.940]  Oh. Uh, oh, here we go. Come on, fellas.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:05.280]  Okay. Um, great. Smash. I, I have not played the first game, actually, for people in chat.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.420]  I don't know anything about this. I watched the TV show. That's pretty good. Yeah. The only
[01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:18.000]  difference is the zombies bite instead of have those, uh, tendril things. And then they're not
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.920]  connected, like, in a hive mind, like in the show. Oh, really? That's a cool thing.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:28.800]  It's a cool mechanic. Yeah, I like, it's interesting. I feel like it makes it
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:35.060]  very bleak and desolate. Yeah. It certainly makes traversing a city much more risky, doesn't it? Yeah.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.200]  All right, I'm gonna let Joel fight this guy for me. There you go.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.120]  Hey, you. What's up? How you doing? No touching. Oh, shit.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.000]  All right. You whacked his ass with a pipe.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:58.160]  Sure did. Oh, I wonder if I can collect stuff or if we need to hurry. Oh, they said hurry.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.860]  Oh, balls. This part is such a pain in the ass, even on easy settings.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.600]  By removing the head or destroying the brain or hitting its butt.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:15.040]  All right, let's have a chat. Well, you know, they say the asshole is the brain of the lower body.
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:26.220]  Is that what you tell your toilet? Yeah, I have a lot of meetings. Hey, buddy, I'm back.
[01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:36.540]  Can you guys advance the plot, please, so we can go?
[01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.470]  Do you do prostate exams, Geoff?
[01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:49.690]  I have, yeah. You've done them? Yeah. You about to get one or did you get one?
[01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:53.970]  No, I'm just getting closer to that age. Yeah, they're fun. Have you had one? Do you usually
[01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:58.950]  do it in the morning or in the afternoon? I always go early in the morning, dude. I try to get my
[01:14:58.950 --> 01:15:03.470]  first appointment. I'm like a 7 or 8 a.m. guy because I read the other day that people's
[01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:05.910]  fingers are more swollen in the morning.
[01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.590]  I would schedule it in a colder time of year.
[01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:22.130]  Oh, then again, though, you'd have the A.C. of the room. So I guess the question is...
[01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:31.710]  Oh, you're gonna get hit. You're gonna get eaten. No! Oh, you got the same exact artery.
[01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:36.210]  How are they so good at that? They can't see.
[01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:49.190]  So, yeah, I guess the question is, do you go in the summer when the A.C. is like
[01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:53.490]  pumping? So in the room, it's cool. Or do you go when it's cold outside?
[01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:58.250]  But the heat might be on, so fingers might get... Nice shot.
[01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:08.950]  My doctor's an old man with old man fingers. Arthritis? I don't think it matters.
[01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:15.950]  They're one way or the other. It's just not a great experience, no matter the temperature.
[01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:23.370]  But it's also a very brief experience. I mean, with arthritis, potentially the older someone
[01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:31.170]  gets, the more it's gonna feel like anal pain. That's true. Nick, you missed. Oh, I sure did.
[01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:41.510]  Yeah, kite him over here. Oh, you got the other one. That was great. You remember in the old days
[01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:45.890]  when we'd be watching Ray do this and you'd go, and then three seconds later they'd all be dead.
[01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:53.350]  I'm dead. The thing I like about this game is the dodge mechanic. That's
[01:16:53.350 --> 01:17:00.030]  did not exist in the first game. All right. Let's go. I see why they gave you so much ammo.
[01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:07.070]  Let's go. All right. Oh, you gotta watch out.
[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:15.630]  Oh, shit. No! Are you shitting me?
[01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:21.370]  Wait, who bit who? What happened there? Joel got bit. Oh.
[01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:25.470]  Let's go. Oh, we can leave. Oh, a crowbar.
[01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.430]  Climb the fucking... okay.
[01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:40.690]  Oh, that was... all right, I feel a little better. Take gloves to us. Okay.
[01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:44.890]  Where are we going? It's this way. Come on. If you incest... oh, it's this stranger.
[01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:53.030]  Boom, boom, boom. Nice shot. All right.
[01:17:56.910 --> 01:18:00.630]  In this... that... we're not gonna miss the scene, but in that scene you find out
[01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:06.610]  what, uh, that Abby says hello and they find out the names of each other.
[01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:11.730]  Okay. Which is a plot point. Like, hi, I'm Joel Miller and this is my brother Tommy.
[01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:14.870]  Oh, sis!
[01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:23.550]  Is it this? Yeah, we should probably watch this. Yeah. Is this a good scene or a bad scene?
[01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:28.270]  Uh, it depends on your perspective. It's just a memorable scene. Yes, quite memorable.
[01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:34.650]  The internet's a big fan of it. I'm gonna definitely endeavor to remember it. All right, we shut the gate. I'll remember that.
[01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:39.690]  Yep. Shot one, two, Jim, Steve, Henry. I've never seen him connect with anybody.
[01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:45.790]  Henry threw that. Pretty solid throw, actually. There's another one.
[01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:51.410]  It seems like the second one was kind of, uh, not superfluous. Yeah, a little bit.
[01:18:53.570 --> 01:19:01.110]  You gotta make a statement. Okay. All right. Let's get inside. All right, let's go ahead and get inside.
[01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:08.530]  Let's get inside. Come on, everybody. Everybody in this game's right-handed, apparently.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.720]  Missing out on some left-hand representation. You know, I don't... I try not to make a big deal out of it, but I notice.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:28.600]  Geoff, I shoot pool left-handed. Does that count? I appreciate the support. Thanks. I got you. Thank you for, uh, thank you for supporting our cause.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.060]  You know what? I got your back. I appreciate it.
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:40.260]  Oh, wait, maybe this is the moment where they find out the names. I'm trying to remember this, y'all, please. Okay, sorry.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:48.390]  Is it about how lucky I am? I'm trying to remember that. It is about how lucky she is.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.280]  Down the hill.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.280]  Y'all should come back with me to restock before we head out.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:15.860]  I'm Mel, by the way. Tommy. That guy played Pierce in the show. The right-hand man. Uh, you got a good voice.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.000]  You got a great voice.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.900]  Y'all act like you heard of us or something.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:25.980]  Because they have.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.140]  Oh, fuck. Yeah, the internet loves to sing.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.740]  All clear? He's out. Put him against the wall.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.120]  Tommy.
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.040]  Get off me. Get off me.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.400]  Oof, it was the kneecap.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.540]  Joel. Miller.
[01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:13.650]  Guess.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.700]  Why don't you say whatever speech you got rehearsed? Get this over with.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:39.380]  Trying to get his leg.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.500]  Do it.
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:02.600]  Damn it.
[01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.730]  Clear out.
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:28.180]  Stupid old man.
[01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.140]  You don't get to rush this.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.380]  Is that the whole scene or is there more?
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.740]  Uh, there's a little bit more once Ellie gets in there.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.560]  So, this'll just end this part and then we can probably call it a stream.
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:03.480]  And end on a very... So Ellie's girlfriend Abby is the bad guy and she kidnaps Joel and tortures him and then Ellie has to save him kind of thing?
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.220]  Uh, yeah. Let's see how this plays out. Oh, or does Joel die?
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:10.480]  Okay.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.980]  Let's find out. Nah, I'll just watch.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:18.360]  Yeah.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.060]  Nope.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:31.900]  Now this time I know there's nothing I... I don't think there's anything I can collect in there so I'm not gonna bother searching drawers and stuff.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.940]  At least anything that we can use in the rest of the game.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:51.980]  Nope.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:52.740]  At least I don't think there is.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.280]  Oh, it's that way.
[01:24:11.190 --> 01:24:12.590]  And down we go.
[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:16.190]  So this is the rest of the scene.
[01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:40.550]  Like a real man.
[01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:14.850]  Joel.
[01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:16.570]  Joel.
[01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:16.790]  Get up.
[01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:19.090]  Joel, fucking get up.
[01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:22.650]  Please stop.
[01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:25.830]  Please don't shoot.
[01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:29.170]  Joel, please get up.
[01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.470]  No.
[01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:32.050]  No.
[01:25:35.610 --> 01:25:35.970]  No.
[01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.950]  No.
[01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:43.910]  Hmm.
[01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.470]  Yeah.
[01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.950]  I, uh...
[01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.990]  I was convinced that
[01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:53.850]  you get him out somehow.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.400]  Memorable scene.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.900]  Very memorable.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.020]  And do you remember the way they marketed
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.740]  some of the trailers for the game?
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:05.800]  No.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.060]  There was a moment where
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.760]  Ellie turns around
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.040]  and Joel says,
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.720]  you think I'd let you do this alone?
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.320]  And it cuts to him standing behind her.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.000]  And
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.900]  so I was convinced that
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.640]  he is still alive and is gonna help us later.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.140]  But it was just
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.340]  kinda like how in the trailer for
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.940]  Infinity War they show the Hulk running in the woods
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.280]  and he's not in the fight at all.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:32.420]  They did it as like a
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.060]  diversion tactic so people wouldn't guess
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:34.620]  the story.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.220]  Ellie.
[01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:41.470]  That'd be a good series.
[01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:43.430]  Just to make a bunch of, uh...
[01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:45.750]  A compilation of all the bullshit moments from trailers.
[01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:48.190]  Oh!
[01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.950]  That's a lot of lies.
[01:26:49.410 --> 01:26:50.810]  You know, another good one would be
[01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:53.350]  moments in trailers that aren't in the film.
[01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.450]  Yep.
[01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:55.970]  There's a ton of those.
[01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:59.410]  There's a lot of those for sure.
[01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:01.810]  Alright, well
[01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:03.590]  shall we call it here
[01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:04.990]  or do you wanna finish this bit?
[01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:07.170]  This is the last part
[01:27:07.170 --> 01:27:08.730]  before we're in the game game.
[01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.450]  Uh, how long is it?
[01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:12.630]  I couldn't get to the horses.
[01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:14.870]  Yeah, we'll save it.
[01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:16.050]  Man, I forgot
[01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:18.490]  how much of a bummer that scene is.
[01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:19.310]  Thanks, Nick.
[01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:23.450]  That Joel seemed like he was probably a good guy.
[01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:29.070]  Yeah, he did some cool stuff.
[01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:31.030]  So Pedro Pascal has
[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:32.310]  that coming in season 2, huh?
[01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:34.170]  Yeah.
[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:36.270]  Well, unless they
[01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:38.010]  divide it up into two seasons and
[01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:40.290]  do like an in-between.
[01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:41.890]  Because there's some stuff that
[01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:44.290]  there's flashbacks that occur throughout this game
[01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:46.270]  and I wouldn't be surprised if maybe they did it more
[01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:47.270]  linearly
[01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:49.970]  in the show.
[01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.610]  I don't know.
[01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.270]  But we'll
[01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.550]  see. Thanks for joining us
[01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:58.270]  everybody. If you
[01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:00.550]  like this, let us know. And if you're watching this
[01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:02.270]  VOD later, please let us know
[01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:03.890]  if this is something we should continue.
[01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:06.590]  Aside from that scene, very fun.
[01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:10.670]  Especially when we get back
[01:28:10.670 --> 01:28:12.710]  on the coffee train.
[01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:14.590]  I liked that scene as well
[01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:16.330]  because I have no emotional attachment
[01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:18.690]  to any of those people. So it didn't mean a fucking thing to me.
[01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.950]  So I quite enjoyed that scene.
[01:28:20.610 --> 01:28:20.930]  Perfect.
[01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:24.250]  And now you see why everybody loves Abby.
[01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:25.390]  There you go.
[01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:28.530]  Alright, well thanks for watching y'all.
[01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:30.530]  Be sure to
[01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:31.650]  check us out.

[01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:40.170]  The whole stream I was like, not gonna mess it up.
[01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:41.410]  Not gonna mess it up.
[01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:43.530]  It's so good.
[01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:44.590]  It's so good.
[01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:49.310]  Patreon.com slash the regulation podcast.
[01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:51.250]  So thanks for watching.
[01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:52.910]  Bye.
[01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.670]  Bye.
