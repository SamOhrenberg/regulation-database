[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, Gavin.
[00:02.700 --> 00:04.460]  I don't think we're supposed to be doing this mission.
[00:04.660 --> 00:07.200]  Well, we were getting a lot of military equipment and military vehicles
[00:07.200 --> 00:09.180]  and then somebody said steal the CD.
[00:18.950 --> 00:19.470]  Andrew!
[00:20.330 --> 00:20.850]  Nick!
[00:21.650 --> 00:22.450]  Get in here!
[00:26.690 --> 00:28.250]  I'm gonna pass out.
[00:29.290 --> 00:30.450]  Oh, we did!
[00:33.190 --> 00:35.770]  We're delivering the equipment to the music box.
[00:37.950 --> 00:39.570]  It's a government CD.
[00:40.070 --> 00:40.930]  Government issued.
[00:48.870 --> 00:51.490]  We're in, this is definitely the right mission.
[00:51.870 --> 00:55.930]  Wait, this video is just whatever Andrew feels like in his phone.
[00:56.350 --> 00:56.690]  No!
[00:57.230 --> 00:59.110]  Andrew answers his texts.
[00:59.490 --> 00:59.930]  The video.
