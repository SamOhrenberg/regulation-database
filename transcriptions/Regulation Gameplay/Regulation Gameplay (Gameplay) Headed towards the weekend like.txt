[00:00.000 --> 00:05.640]  Hey, thanks for coming and hanging out on Friday at the best time of the fucking week with us right now.
[00:06.480 --> 00:07.820]  We're closing in.
[00:08.640 --> 00:12.140]  Fucking got it in our sights right now. We're about to pull the trigger. Blat, blat.
[00:12.900 --> 00:15.960]  501 dead. Bleeding out right in front of us.
[00:16.200 --> 00:21.760]  We've got a weekend to roll around in the blood and relax and enjoy life before we have to put our clothes back on and go to work Monday.
[00:22.400 --> 00:25.280]  What? Aren't we doing work tomorrow?
[00:25.960 --> 00:26.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:27.600 --> 00:28.760]  So what's happening?
[00:28.760 --> 00:31.280]  Doesn't fit the narrative, Eric. I don't need to know that.
