[00:00.000 --> 00:03.220]  I'm a little mouse, don't trap me.
[00:03.540 --> 00:06.740]  Oh no, the little mouse is here. Uh-oh.
[00:07.340 --> 00:09.120]  Uh, guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:09.480 --> 00:11.480]  It is four o'clock on a Friday.
[00:12.140 --> 00:15.100]  Uh, we're excited to get going. This is Monaco 2.
[00:15.260 --> 00:17.360]  We've never played it. Gavin doesn't know the buttons.
[00:17.600 --> 00:19.460]  X is to grab and throw or something.
[00:19.940 --> 00:21.620]  Uh, Andrew was explaining it to us.
[00:21.760 --> 00:22.200]  Hold Y to dive.
[00:22.440 --> 00:26.540]  But the only way we can get going is when we get this whole chat
[00:26.540 --> 00:29.000]  filled with corn cats and only corn cats.
[00:29.560 --> 00:32.840]  Just a million corn cats, only corn cats,
[00:32.980 --> 00:33.920]  all the way through.
[00:34.240 --> 00:35.300]  You just want to give us-
[00:35.300 --> 00:36.440]  Nope. Nope. Nope.
[00:36.940 --> 00:37.920]  That's too many piss rats.
[00:38.160 --> 00:39.720]  That's way too many piss rats.
[00:40.160 --> 00:41.320]  No, no, no, no.
[00:41.660 --> 00:42.760]  No, no, no, no.
[00:43.040 --> 00:43.800]  Come on.
[00:44.140 --> 00:46.100]  This is, wow, that's way too many piss rats.
[00:46.400 --> 00:47.280]  That's a wall of piss.
[00:47.280 --> 00:47.940]  So many piss rats.
[00:47.940 --> 00:48.960]  Damn, that's a wall of piss.
[00:48.960 --> 00:50.520]  All right, then let's get going.
[00:51.040 --> 00:53.560]  Are you guys, are you guys ready for the Yacht Club?
[00:53.820 --> 00:55.840]  That is really, that's way more than two to one.
[00:56.060 --> 00:56.560]  Go to the Yacht Club.
[00:56.560 --> 00:57.220]  Let's do this thing.
[00:57.600 --> 00:58.500]  Let's do it.
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.560]  Compete on the leaderboards.
[01:01.240 --> 01:02.380]  This is just all it says.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.000]  Let's do it.
[01:03.740 --> 01:04.220]  All right.
[01:04.540 --> 01:05.660]  We're going to compete on the leaderboards?
[01:05.900 --> 01:06.740]  I don't, yes, no.
[01:06.820 --> 01:07.220]  I don't know.
[01:07.320 --> 01:07.980]  Too many piss rats.
[01:08.060 --> 01:08.640]  Make them go away.
[01:09.040 --> 01:10.340]  This game is for players.
[01:10.460 --> 01:10.840]  It's true.
[01:11.300 --> 01:12.100]  Get rid of all your cats.
[01:12.880 --> 01:13.320]  Yeah, okay.
[01:14.220 --> 01:15.120]  It might be more than four,
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.560]  because there's more than four characters
[01:16.560 --> 01:17.180]  you can pick from.
[01:19.240 --> 01:20.820]  Post Poozoomies and Zeke Hardshaft,
[01:20.900 --> 01:21.960]  thank you for the gifted subs.
[01:23.400 --> 01:23.760]  Okay.
[01:25.280 --> 01:25.640]  Okay.
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.780]  This is a very,
[01:26.820 --> 01:29.760]  that's a very German man talking to a very British guy.
[01:30.420 --> 01:32.220]  Mucketopper sounds like he would be a big rookie.
[01:34.240 --> 01:35.380]  Just deliver to his yacht,
[01:35.520 --> 01:36.400]  and then we square as a bear.
[01:37.000 --> 01:37.740]  And after this, we're done.
[01:37.800 --> 01:38.240]  No more jobs.
[01:39.280 --> 01:41.280]  On your way, old Venomational Chumps.
[01:43.920 --> 01:44.360]  Okay.
[01:44.900 --> 01:47.640]  So, it looks like we have choices.
[01:48.940 --> 01:51.540]  There's Zeke, and there's Cosmo and Gimlet.
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.260]  I want to be Cosmo and Gimlet,
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.340]  because there's a little dog.
[01:55.280 --> 01:55.720]  Okay.
[01:56.360 --> 01:57.080]  Well, then.
[01:57.340 --> 01:57.820]  What the hell?
[01:58.280 --> 01:58.540]  What?
[01:58.620 --> 01:59.560]  I should've read what I did.
[01:59.700 --> 02:00.720]  I'm just, yeah.
[02:01.480 --> 02:03.160]  So, you guys just started hitting buttons?
[02:03.480 --> 02:03.760]  Yep.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.040]  Yeah.
[02:05.260 --> 02:05.860]  Pretty cool.
[02:06.500 --> 02:08.700]  Okay, so this is the map.
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.980]  Oh, I'm not really sure what we're looking at.
[02:09.980 --> 02:11.360]  Dash past guards to escape quickly.
[02:12.420 --> 02:14.720]  I think we can sort of scout things out, I'm assuming.
[02:15.020 --> 02:15.520]  Oh, okay.
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.320]  Keys and all that.
[02:17.700 --> 02:17.840]  Yeah.
[02:18.000 --> 02:19.380]  Bumpers to look at different floors.
[02:19.880 --> 02:20.140]  Yeah.
[02:20.460 --> 02:21.700]  What are we supposed to be getting?
[02:22.060 --> 02:23.180]  There's like a...
[02:24.400 --> 02:25.200]  Like this...
[02:25.200 --> 02:27.220]  You gotta get the gift and deliver it to the yacht.
[02:27.620 --> 02:28.460]  Oh, okay.
[02:29.600 --> 02:31.380]  The yacht, that's in the restroom.
[02:31.920 --> 02:32.900]  Perfect place for a gift.
[02:33.040 --> 02:35.180]  There is a lot going on here.
[02:35.460 --> 02:37.840]  I have a feeling that it's not gonna be just walk in here,
[02:38.060 --> 02:38.900]  grab the gift and go.
[02:39.920 --> 02:40.320]  So...
[02:40.320 --> 02:41.060]  We need key.
[02:41.280 --> 02:42.320]  Uh-oh, well, here we go.
[02:42.320 --> 02:42.820]  I'm readied up.
[02:43.460 --> 02:44.280]  Let's do this thing.
[02:44.600 --> 02:45.620]  All right, here comes Gimlet.
[02:46.980 --> 02:48.580]  Spin move, spin move, spin move.
[02:48.640 --> 02:48.860]  Coin.
[02:49.140 --> 02:49.680]  That's pretty cool.
[02:50.300 --> 02:50.700]  Coin.
[02:51.100 --> 02:52.660]  Oh, there's, ooh, you can hide?
[02:53.400 --> 02:53.800]  Interesting.
[02:53.800 --> 02:56.880]  Why let's you look at the map?
[02:57.160 --> 02:58.780]  Oh, okay, the overall map, cool.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.300]  L is sneak.
[03:00.900 --> 03:01.940]  I think I'm blind.
[03:03.020 --> 03:03.760]  I guess so.
[03:04.500 --> 03:08.380]  Yeah, it looks like L is sneak.
[03:09.700 --> 03:10.460]  This is hide?
[03:10.860 --> 03:11.280]  What is this?
[03:11.760 --> 03:12.800]  It looks like you're lock picking.
[03:13.620 --> 03:14.120]  Oh, cool.
[03:14.740 --> 03:17.340]  Okay, so it looks like you can interact with stuff
[03:17.340 --> 03:18.500]  that's shining on the screen
[03:18.500 --> 03:19.980]  and then that's how you get that stuff.
[03:20.080 --> 03:21.580]  You wanna just try to open that?
[03:21.620 --> 03:21.960]  There you go.
[03:22.640 --> 03:23.280]  Oh, nice.
[03:24.460 --> 03:26.540]  All right, let's crouch and sneak in.
[03:26.540 --> 03:28.060]  Bardem 669, thank you.
[03:29.660 --> 03:30.920]  Oh God, stay low.
[03:32.580 --> 03:33.660]  Okay, I think we're good.
[03:34.880 --> 03:36.180]  I think we're doing all right.
[03:36.660 --> 03:37.220]  Yeah, I think we're doing great.
[03:37.240 --> 03:39.140]  Oh, oh, oh, those cards, I didn't even notice them.
[03:39.220 --> 03:40.000]  Oh God, come over here.
[03:40.100 --> 03:40.660]  Yeah, but I got the key.
[03:41.180 --> 03:41.460]  Okay.
[03:41.620 --> 03:41.980]  Good job.
[03:43.220 --> 03:44.320]  Okay, it looks like we're on our way.
[03:44.720 --> 03:45.200]  This seems fine.
[03:45.720 --> 03:47.480]  Look at us, just sneaky team.
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.320]  Yeah, we're doing sneaky.
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.260]  What's that thing?
[03:50.280 --> 03:50.760]  Oh, Pokemon bags.
[03:50.760 --> 03:51.580]  Are we sneak again?
[03:52.740 --> 03:52.980]  L.
[03:53.440 --> 03:53.720]  L?
[03:54.320 --> 03:54.600]  Checkpoint.
[03:54.840 --> 03:56.440]  Interact with this to change characters,
[03:56.560 --> 03:57.540]  but I think we're already locked in.
[03:57.680 --> 03:59.100]  That must be like if you play by yourself.
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.220]  Oh, there's people in here.
[04:01.580 --> 04:01.860]  Jesus.
[04:02.740 --> 04:03.060]  Oh, wow.
[04:03.240 --> 04:03.480]  Yeah, dude.
[04:03.740 --> 04:04.360]  Oh, there's one guy.
[04:04.360 --> 04:05.500]  Oh, he's moving, he's moving, he's moving.
[04:05.560 --> 04:06.180]  Oh, you better hide.
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.080]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[04:09.680 --> 04:10.000]  Uh-oh.
[04:10.040 --> 04:11.200]  Oh, he can't see past the pillar.
[04:11.340 --> 04:11.800]  That's interesting.
[04:12.000 --> 04:12.560]  You gotta hide.
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.440]  You gotta hide.
[04:13.960 --> 04:14.680]  Hide in the branch.
[04:15.780 --> 04:16.300]  No, no, he can't see us.
[04:16.300 --> 04:17.760]  We can't see him, he can't see us.
[04:18.140 --> 04:19.800]  Fog of war, fog of war, fog of war.
[04:20.000 --> 04:20.880]  I see, that's cool.
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.000]  So, one of us has to be able to see him?
[04:24.000 --> 04:24.760]  Yep, but it's okay.
[04:24.860 --> 04:25.620]  Oh, someone lost him.
[04:25.680 --> 04:26.880]  Oh, he baited him with the dog.
[04:27.140 --> 04:28.280]  I baited him with the dog.
[04:28.360 --> 04:29.620]  Grab everything you got.
[04:29.700 --> 04:30.420]  Grab everything you got.
[04:30.540 --> 04:31.280]  All right, all right.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.060]  Are we clear?
[04:32.220 --> 04:32.800]  Everyone get through.
[04:33.020 --> 04:33.580]  Everyone get through.
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.320]  I'm right here with you.
[04:35.440 --> 04:36.260]  You're just leaving the dog?
[04:36.260 --> 04:37.220]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[04:37.240 --> 04:37.640]  No, I'm calling the dog back.
[04:37.660 --> 04:38.240]  Oh, here comes the dog.
[04:38.280 --> 04:38.500]  No, the dog's coming.
[04:38.820 --> 04:39.380]  I got the dog.
[04:40.060 --> 04:40.700]  Yeah, baby.
[04:42.760 --> 04:43.400]  Dog power.
[04:43.800 --> 04:44.340]  That's awesome.
[04:45.220 --> 04:45.540]  Checkpoint.
[04:45.920 --> 04:47.300]  Oh, we got like smoke grenades?
[04:47.320 --> 04:47.540]  Oh, oh shit.
[04:47.840 --> 04:48.320]  What is this?
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.180]  Do you buy it?
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.100]  You can just grab them, push A on them.
[04:52.540 --> 04:54.700]  But I don't think, I think it costs you money, doesn't it?
[04:55.000 --> 04:55.480]  Does it?
[04:55.600 --> 04:56.240]  I didn't even notice.
[04:56.860 --> 04:59.120]  It says, doesn't it say like 10 above it?
[04:59.860 --> 05:00.300]  Oh yeah.
[05:00.980 --> 05:01.740]  Yeah, I spent 10.
[05:01.760 --> 05:03.240]  Oh, laser wires, laser wires.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.100]  Oh shit, boys.
[05:05.180 --> 05:06.680]  How the fuck, I don't know.
[05:07.420 --> 05:08.840]  Looks like we just need to go around.
[05:09.420 --> 05:11.040]  No, I think, yeah.
[05:11.740 --> 05:12.140]  Yeah, I think you just go around.
[05:12.140 --> 05:14.060]  Wow, that's really inefficient, if I'm being honest.
[05:16.660 --> 05:17.340]  Oh, what's that?
[05:17.340 --> 05:18.960]  Oh, you're dropping a smoke grenade,
[05:19.100 --> 05:20.740]  I think in the lower floor, maybe?
[05:20.920 --> 05:21.800]  I turned the power off.
[05:21.960 --> 05:22.600]  Oh shit.
[05:22.700 --> 05:22.800]  Oh, cool.
[05:22.920 --> 05:24.000]  Oh, snap.
[05:24.400 --> 05:24.880]  That's awesome.
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.380]  There's a couple of guys up here, careful.
[05:27.420 --> 05:27.840]  Getting there.
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.200]  There's two guys here.
[05:29.520 --> 05:30.200]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[05:30.980 --> 05:32.040]  So, could you stab them?
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.900]  Hang on, no, no, I don't think we can,
[05:33.940 --> 05:34.620]  can we attack them?
[05:34.740 --> 05:35.100]  Oh shit.
[05:35.120 --> 05:35.460]  Like knock them out?
[05:37.280 --> 05:37.540]  Uh oh.
[05:38.220 --> 05:38.760]  Andrew, look out.
[05:39.020 --> 05:40.600]  Oh my God, what are you doing?
[05:40.620 --> 05:41.020]  Wait, wait, wait.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.760]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, stay there, Andrew.
[05:42.940 --> 05:43.860]  Andrew, stay there, stay there.
[05:43.940 --> 05:44.080]  Yep.
[05:45.900 --> 05:46.860]  Does this do anything?
[05:46.860 --> 05:48.680]  Wait, power's coming back on.
[05:48.720 --> 05:49.580]  Give me just a second, hang on.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.120]  Does this do anything?
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.360]  Wait, what are you doing?
[05:53.560 --> 05:55.060]  Can you go get that now?
[05:55.520 --> 05:57.460]  Yeah, now you don't have to worry about the,
[05:58.000 --> 05:58.640]  yeah, there you go.
[05:58.780 --> 05:59.820]  Oh, the grid thing?
[06:00.020 --> 06:00.180]  Yep.
[06:00.340 --> 06:01.460]  Holy shit, money went everywhere.
[06:01.460 --> 06:01.720]  There you go.
[06:01.780 --> 06:02.160]  Oh, careful.
[06:05.160 --> 06:05.720]  Jesus Christ.
[06:06.480 --> 06:07.080]  Go, go, go.
[06:07.120 --> 06:07.740]  All right, I'm checking this.
[06:08.680 --> 06:10.100]  Is this just to hide or to go elsewhere?
[06:10.320 --> 06:11.180]  Oh, I'm in the vents.
[06:11.440 --> 06:11.920]  I'm in the vents.
[06:11.940 --> 06:12.780]  Dude, I wanna get in the vents.
[06:12.980 --> 06:13.260]  Oh shit.
[06:13.680 --> 06:15.080]  All right, it looks like we all gotta go in the vents.
[06:16.160 --> 06:16.520]  Geronimo!
[06:17.100 --> 06:17.140]  Oh!
[06:17.140 --> 06:17.480]  Oh shit.
[06:17.480 --> 06:18.300]  I wanna get in the vent.

[06:34.040 --> 06:34.440]  That's my bad.
[06:34.440 --> 06:35.120]  Who threw a smoke?
[06:36.080 --> 06:36.840]  How'd you throw it?

[12:51.140 --> 12:53.240]  Is it handlebar, mustache bar or whatever?
[12:53.860 --> 12:55.620]  Would have shit like that.
[12:55.840 --> 12:56.900]  And I would have one there.
[12:57.060 --> 12:57.600]  That would be it.
[12:58.400 --> 12:59.100]  Ooh, okay.

[13:13.560 --> 13:13.980]  Okay.
[13:14.280 --> 13:17.280]  So there's a vent over on this left-hand side
[13:17.710 --> 13:18.980]  that we'll probably go to later.
[13:19.140 --> 13:20.940]  Ooh, ooh, there's a guy over here.
[13:21.820 --> 13:24.240]  Okay, this door's unlocked if we need it.
[13:24.360 --> 13:24.540]  Cool.
[13:24.720 --> 13:25.780]  There's two men in this room.
[13:26.300 --> 13:26.700]  Okay.
[13:27.720 --> 13:29.460]  Little lockpick situation over there.
[13:29.780 --> 13:30.680]  How you looking over there?
[13:31.480 --> 13:33.000]  Oh, there's a dude in this room looking towards us.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.580]  There's one person who's kind of like hanging out.
[13:35.080 --> 13:35.900]  See two of them.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.060]  I wonder if I can distract this guy with my dog.
[13:38.620 --> 13:39.280]  Schindler's fist.
[13:39.440 --> 13:40.520]  Holy shit, son.
[13:40.680 --> 13:42.860]  Schindler's fist going off on a Friday, baby.
[13:42.860 --> 13:43.840]  That's what I'm talking about.
[13:44.160 --> 13:45.500]  I didn't even see the top of it.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.460]  It went by so fast.
[13:47.180 --> 13:48.080]  Don't know what this is.
[13:48.080 --> 13:49.320]  Thank you so much, Schindler's fist.
[13:49.640 --> 13:50.700]  I got three lives remaining.
[13:50.760 --> 13:51.400]  Got another life.
[13:52.440 --> 13:52.800]  Oh.
[13:53.720 --> 13:54.660]  Okay, that's a vent.
[13:55.060 --> 13:55.420]  Nice.
[13:57.660 --> 13:58.380]  Oh, ah!
[13:58.380 --> 14:01.660]  No, don't relax like I don't have gimlet.
[14:02.140 --> 14:04.260]  Like I don't have gimlet.
[14:05.300 --> 14:06.400]  Well, you have to get away from him now.
[14:06.440 --> 14:06.820]  What are you doing?
[14:07.320 --> 14:08.700]  I hopped in the vent just to get away.
[14:09.260 --> 14:10.620]  It just takes you back to the entrance.
[14:11.240 --> 14:11.400]  Yep.
[14:11.560 --> 14:11.940]  Oh, okay.
[14:14.080 --> 14:14.700]  Oh, shit.
[14:14.940 --> 14:15.040]  Okay.
[14:15.420 --> 14:15.660]  All right.
[14:15.700 --> 14:16.120]  Oh, hello.
[14:16.320 --> 14:16.860]  Let's make our way through.
[14:17.020 --> 14:17.620]  We gotta get past this guy.
[14:18.020 --> 14:18.860]  There's two people in here.
[14:18.940 --> 14:19.920]  Oh, dog him up.
[14:20.880 --> 14:21.360]  There we go.
[14:21.600 --> 14:22.400]  Can you double dog?
[14:22.580 --> 14:22.880]  Do you dog?
[14:23.100 --> 14:23.600]  No, no, no.
[14:23.640 --> 14:24.560]  I can only single dog.
[14:24.800 --> 14:25.600]  I can only single dog.
[14:25.780 --> 14:26.580]  I didn't even see him.
[14:27.960 --> 14:29.340]  Can you like break a window?
[14:29.580 --> 14:30.020]  What is this?
[14:30.260 --> 14:30.700]  Ideas?
[14:30.960 --> 14:31.460]  That's hide.
[14:33.220 --> 14:33.660]  Yeah.
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.300]  Let's all get in.
[14:36.980 --> 14:38.200]  How many people could fit?
[14:38.760 --> 14:39.240]  All of us.
[14:39.260 --> 14:40.040]  Oh, all of us.
[14:40.120 --> 14:40.560]  That's pretty cool.
[14:42.300 --> 14:44.240]  Any ideas for how we want to get by this?
[14:44.380 --> 14:46.040]  Like, what powers does everyone have?
[14:46.700 --> 14:47.580]  I have my dog.
[14:48.440 --> 14:49.260]  I have coffee.
[14:50.060 --> 14:50.540]  You have coffee.
[14:50.540 --> 14:51.140]  I can send out a drone.
[14:51.380 --> 14:52.280]  Dash, pass cards.
[14:53.040 --> 14:53.300]  Oh.
[14:53.300 --> 14:53.800]  I have coffee.
[14:54.580 --> 14:56.320]  I could probably just do this.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.740]  I could probably just go like,
[14:58.160 --> 14:59.120]  what, what?
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.280]  Well.
[15:00.460 --> 15:00.900]  Okay.
[15:01.180 --> 15:02.060]  They didn't see me.
[15:02.060 --> 15:02.680]  You certainly distracted them.
[15:02.740 --> 15:03.460]  They didn't get me.
[15:03.460 --> 15:04.320]  They didn't see me.
[15:05.200 --> 15:07.440]  They didn't get you, but they all saw.
[15:07.540 --> 15:07.720]  Ah!
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.080]  I was following you, Green.
[15:14.840 --> 15:15.080]  Yep.
[15:15.140 --> 15:16.000]  Yep, yep, yep.
[15:16.080 --> 15:17.300]  I'm crouching behind a table.
[15:17.360 --> 15:18.160]  Oh, God, he's coming back.
[15:18.540 --> 15:19.160]  Pulled a gun out.
[15:19.800 --> 15:20.600]  That's crazy.
[15:20.860 --> 15:21.400]  Oh, he did?
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.980]  How are we supposed to get by this?
[15:23.560 --> 15:23.880]  Dog him.
[15:24.500 --> 15:25.280]  There's two guys.
[15:25.280 --> 15:26.020]  Dog one will run past together.
[15:26.220 --> 15:27.160]  There's two guys.
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.500]  Yeah, dog one will run past the other.
[15:34.030 --> 15:34.650]  I don't know that,
[15:35.050 --> 15:37.450]  I don't think Nick is built for the sneaking life.
[15:39.950 --> 15:41.410]  I get a disguise in here.
[15:42.230 --> 15:42.730]  Here we go.
[15:43.110 --> 15:47.250]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[15:47.390 --> 15:49.770]  So, what's the implications of getting seen?
[15:50.690 --> 15:52.010]  They seem to come after you.
[15:53.890 --> 15:55.110]  And then what, do they kill you?
[15:55.910 --> 15:56.350]  Probably.
[15:57.870 --> 15:58.130]  Okay.
[15:58.130 --> 16:00.570]  Looks like Andrew has taken the lone...
[16:00.570 --> 16:00.970]  The disguise?
[16:01.910 --> 16:02.270]  Disguise.
[16:03.150 --> 16:04.050]  Oh, there's only one?
[16:04.890 --> 16:06.650]  Yeah, it doesn't seem like I can take the other one.
[16:06.930 --> 16:07.370]  Oh, damn.
[16:09.630 --> 16:10.330]  Oh, balls.
[16:10.990 --> 16:11.570]  You don't see me.
[16:11.690 --> 16:12.450]  You don't see, he sees me.
[16:12.550 --> 16:13.670]  Holy shit balls.
[16:13.690 --> 16:14.390]  He saw me.
[16:16.730 --> 16:17.490]  What is this?
[16:18.130 --> 16:18.570]  What the hell?
[16:18.670 --> 16:20.370]  Oh no, your dog deactivated.
[16:20.690 --> 16:21.030]  Okay.
[16:21.590 --> 16:22.710]  I've got disguise on.
[16:23.350 --> 16:23.690]  Do you?
[16:26.960 --> 16:28.620]  Oh my God, how are we supposed to get through this?
[16:29.060 --> 16:29.680]  Oh my God.
[16:29.820 --> 16:30.380]  Oh shit.
[16:30.720 --> 16:31.320]  Oh shit.
[16:31.540 --> 16:32.140]  Oh, Nick.
[16:32.380 --> 16:32.780]  Oh, balls.
[16:33.300 --> 16:33.660]  Goodbye.
[16:34.420 --> 16:35.820]  Scared the hell out of me, Gavin.
[16:38.480 --> 16:38.940]  Oh, a key.
[16:39.100 --> 16:39.400]  I got a key.
[16:40.240 --> 16:40.560]  Nice.
[16:40.660 --> 16:41.120]  Hey, come back here.
[16:41.140 --> 16:41.840]  Ah, ow!
[16:42.760 --> 16:43.120]  Ah!
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.920]  Nick is, Nick is not built for this.
[16:46.720 --> 16:47.320]  No, I am.
[16:48.480 --> 16:49.820]  I didn't know that guy could do that.
[16:50.280 --> 16:51.340]  My disguise wore off.
[16:51.360 --> 16:52.020]  Oh Christ.
[16:53.600 --> 16:54.320]  Oh Jesus.
[16:54.380 --> 16:56.060]  It's a room full of these dudes.
[16:56.380 --> 16:57.220]  Has anyone been upstairs?
[16:57.840 --> 16:58.240]  No.
[16:58.580 --> 16:59.180]  Bunch of coins in here.
[16:59.180 --> 16:59.540]  I'm going upstairs.
[17:04.350 --> 17:04.750]  Impossible.
[17:05.230 --> 17:05.870]  Doors unlocked.
[17:06.550 --> 17:07.930]  Okay, we're on the move here.
[17:08.930 --> 17:09.410]  Oh, nice, cool.
[17:09.510 --> 17:09.990]  Guys, come upstairs.
[17:10.470 --> 17:11.050]  All right, we're coming.
[17:11.570 --> 17:11.950]  Coming up.
[17:12.210 --> 17:12.990]  Come to where I am.
[17:13.510 --> 17:14.270]  Yep, coming now.
[17:15.030 --> 17:16.030]  On our way.
[17:16.230 --> 17:16.730]  We're sneaking.
[17:17.670 --> 17:18.350]  Gimlet in tow.
[17:19.890 --> 17:21.050]  Oh yes, Gavin.
[17:21.390 --> 17:22.270]  Oh, that's perfect.
[17:25.350 --> 17:26.230]  Let's, while we're all together,
[17:26.310 --> 17:27.210]  let's see what coffee does.
[17:28.970 --> 17:30.170]  Here you go.
[17:30.790 --> 17:32.010]  Did it do anything?
[17:33.510 --> 17:34.850]  Maybe we're faster now.
[17:35.030 --> 17:37.170]  Oh, look, this guy's just like...
[17:37.170 --> 17:38.730]  It does seem to be faster now.
[17:39.510 --> 17:39.930]  The key in here.
[17:40.270 --> 17:42.130]  Excuse me, that's my key.
[17:42.810 --> 17:43.390]  I thank you.
[17:45.910 --> 17:47.630]  Does the disguise wear off?
[17:47.810 --> 17:47.930]  Yeah.
[17:48.150 --> 17:50.210]  It looks like it's starting to.
[17:51.530 --> 17:52.450]  Open this.
[17:54.570 --> 17:55.690]  Sneaking around.
[17:57.250 --> 17:58.730]  Oh, can we play some pool?
[18:01.490 --> 18:02.550]  I don't think so.
[18:02.550 --> 18:03.010]  Oh, a vent.
[18:03.850 --> 18:05.250]  Got a vent over here.
[18:05.970 --> 18:06.630]  A vent in space.
[18:06.630 --> 18:09.750]  Has SLC Punk more gifted, more gifted subs.
[18:10.110 --> 18:10.470]  Wild in here.
[18:10.510 --> 18:10.910]  Thank you so much.
[18:12.050 --> 18:12.830]  Thank you.
[18:13.050 --> 18:14.290]  Oh, there's a guy in here?
[18:14.670 --> 18:14.990]  Interesting.
[18:15.230 --> 18:16.050]  Gavin, there's a locked door right here.
[18:16.290 --> 18:16.830]  Let's take a look.
[18:17.790 --> 18:18.370]  Oh, it's a bathroom.
[18:18.470 --> 18:18.630]  Oh.
[18:19.630 --> 18:20.510]  Oh, it's to hide.
[18:20.630 --> 18:20.830]  Okay.
[18:21.310 --> 18:21.710]  Damn.
[18:23.910 --> 18:25.970]  How do we get through here?
[18:26.550 --> 18:27.170]  Let's see.
[18:28.490 --> 18:29.390]  Someone's on my ass.
[18:31.290 --> 18:32.490]  Did your disguise wear off?
[18:33.030 --> 18:33.210]  Yeah.
[18:33.670 --> 18:34.190]  It did.
[18:35.030 --> 18:35.330]  Yeah.
[18:35.450 --> 18:35.830]  Oh, interesting.
[18:38.450 --> 18:38.670]  Oh.
[18:38.670 --> 18:38.830]  Uh-oh.
[18:42.480 --> 18:43.600]  Get back, damn you.
[18:44.120 --> 18:44.540]  He asked.
[18:44.540 --> 18:46.140]  Pick the fucking character.
[18:46.280 --> 18:46.400]  Okay.
[18:50.150 --> 18:51.690]  All right, I made it out onto the terrace.
[18:51.810 --> 18:52.590]  You didn't get to, Gavin.
[18:52.930 --> 18:53.370]  Gavin!
[18:54.210 --> 18:54.810]  Uh-oh.
[18:55.630 --> 18:56.570]  Oh, more lockpicks.
[18:56.650 --> 18:57.150]  That's it.
[18:57.690 --> 18:58.590]  Nick, I'm coming in hot.
[18:58.590 --> 18:59.190]  Ow.
[18:59.690 --> 19:01.230]  Okay, there's nothing else up here.
[19:01.710 --> 19:01.750]  Ow.
[19:02.790 --> 19:03.270]  Floor clear.
[19:03.270 --> 19:03.390]  Oh, I see.
[19:03.650 --> 19:05.390]  Floor clear, rooftop, patio.
[19:06.850 --> 19:07.070]  Nick.
[19:08.150 --> 19:08.990]  I see you.
[19:09.070 --> 19:09.470]  Keep running.
[19:10.830 --> 19:11.470]  Keep running.
[19:11.570 --> 19:13.110]  You can hide behind the shrubs.
[19:14.350 --> 19:15.470]  Get me in a shrub.
[19:18.530 --> 19:19.430]  Oh, don't hit me.
[19:19.470 --> 19:20.150]  Don't hit me with the stick.
[19:20.250 --> 19:20.590]  Don't hit me.
[19:20.850 --> 19:22.650]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm touchy.
[19:26.910 --> 19:27.330]  Okay.
[19:27.330 --> 19:27.450]  Okay.
[19:28.610 --> 19:31.470]  Dude, me and Gimlet are fucking tearing it up, bro.
[19:32.450 --> 19:33.670]  Money, money, money.
[19:33.970 --> 19:35.590]  What would you call Gimlet as a nickname
[19:35.590 --> 19:36.390]  if you had Gimlet?
[19:36.670 --> 19:37.090]  Gimjob?
[19:37.850 --> 19:38.930]  Oh yeah, GimGam.
[19:40.050 --> 19:40.490]  Gimmo.
[19:41.770 --> 19:42.210]  Gimmo.
[19:42.570 --> 19:44.010]  Big, honestly, probably Big Gim.
[19:44.570 --> 19:45.450]  Big Gim's good.
[19:47.070 --> 19:49.150]  I think Big, I think Big Gim would be it.
[19:49.550 --> 19:50.210]  Oh, oh, oh.
[19:50.390 --> 19:51.570]  How you guys, how you guys doing?
[19:51.990 --> 19:52.430]  The Gimini.
[19:52.430 --> 19:52.750]  We're getting hit.
[19:53.410 --> 19:55.490]  They are just running all over the place.
[19:55.490 --> 19:58.710]  I just hear, I hear Nick shrieking and running.
[19:58.850 --> 19:59.410]  Oh, I'm dead.
[19:59.410 --> 20:00.450]  None of it, none of it's good.
[20:00.630 --> 20:01.450]  I'm dead, help me.
[20:02.770 --> 20:03.930]  I got knocked the fuck out.
[20:05.530 --> 20:06.650]  I don't, where are you?
[20:06.670 --> 20:07.510]  Are you above us?
[20:07.610 --> 20:08.510]  I'm on the top floor.
[20:10.470 --> 20:11.630]  Hey, check this out.
[20:12.430 --> 20:13.110]  Gimlet's gold up here.
[20:13.110 --> 20:14.190]  I'm gonna Gimlet this motherfucker.
[20:14.310 --> 20:14.970]  Oh, nice.
[20:14.990 --> 20:15.350]  Boom, baby.
[20:15.530 --> 20:16.810]  Oh, Gavin, I see you.
[20:16.890 --> 20:17.370]  I'm coming up, son.
[20:17.950 --> 20:18.970]  They just left you here?
[20:19.350 --> 20:19.890]  That's rough.
[20:20.050 --> 20:20.610]  They did.
[20:21.970 --> 20:23.650]  They left me here to bleed out.
[20:23.890 --> 20:24.710]  Oh shit, a load of money.
[20:25.710 --> 20:28.310]  I just got so much cash, baby.
[20:29.150 --> 20:30.570]  Nick, what's the size of this onion?
[20:31.430 --> 20:33.570]  Me and Gimlet on the fucking prowl, bro.
[20:33.690 --> 20:34.290]  This rocks.
[20:35.430 --> 20:36.290]  So that's where the violin is.
[20:36.290 --> 20:37.490]  Where are my big gim heads at?
[20:37.590 --> 20:38.110]  This rocks.
[20:41.430 --> 20:42.830]  Gim-gams, they call them.
[20:45.810 --> 20:46.770]  I'm getting the violin.
[20:47.690 --> 20:48.630]  Yeah, already?
[20:49.390 --> 20:49.650]  Yep.
[20:50.170 --> 20:51.430]  Wow, ooh, escape.
[20:52.410 --> 20:53.510]  Someone knows we're here.
[20:54.290 --> 20:55.550]  All right, let's get moving, Gavin.
[20:56.030 --> 20:56.610]  Which way?
[20:57.030 --> 20:58.030]  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[20:58.050 --> 20:58.850]  I'll follow you.
[20:59.430 --> 21:00.430]  Oh, pig dick.
[21:00.530 --> 21:02.290]  Oh God, maybe the other way.
[21:04.570 --> 21:07.450]  Pardon, excuse me.
[21:08.290 --> 21:09.150]  Uh-oh, oh balls.
[21:09.410 --> 21:09.950]  Ow, I'm getting hit.
[21:11.650 --> 21:12.730]  Gavin, did you go back up?
[21:13.090 --> 21:14.210]  No, I'm on my way down.
[21:14.390 --> 21:15.110]  I'm on my way down.
[21:15.190 --> 21:16.270]  Oh, then I'm the fool.
[21:17.690 --> 21:18.610]  Isn't out, down?
[21:18.890 --> 21:20.490]  Oh, boom, check it out.
[21:20.770 --> 21:21.310]  More disguise.
[21:22.270 --> 21:23.070]  Ow, shit.
[21:23.290 --> 21:24.650]  Gimlet's got you, Gimlet's got you.
[21:24.650 --> 21:25.530]  Gimlet's got you, bro.
[21:26.230 --> 21:28.290]  Where the hell are the stairs?
[21:28.830 --> 21:30.370]  Got a disguise right in front of that guy.
[21:30.850 --> 21:32.510]  That's right, it's because he was distracted
[21:32.510 --> 21:33.670]  by how cute Gimlet was.
[21:34.510 --> 21:36.150]  Where the flip in the hell?
[21:36.310 --> 21:37.310]  Disguise is wearing off.
[21:38.090 --> 21:38.290]  Yep.
[21:38.870 --> 21:39.510]  Gonna wear off.
[21:39.630 --> 21:40.050]  Disguise time.
[21:40.730 --> 21:41.530]  You just gotta make it.
[21:41.570 --> 21:42.010]  All right, hello.
[21:44.050 --> 21:44.450]  Where?
[21:45.170 --> 21:46.510]  Ooh, gold, gold.
[21:46.570 --> 21:46.770]  Nice.
[21:46.990 --> 21:48.490]  Oh, I'm not, I'm not hitting anyone.
[21:49.050 --> 21:50.290]  Luxury suite clear.
[21:50.950 --> 21:51.370]  Oh, no.
[21:51.570 --> 21:51.650]  There you go, boys.
[21:52.070 --> 21:52.890]  Shit, no.
[21:53.170 --> 21:54.030]  Gavin, did you just go down?
[21:54.030 --> 21:54.310]  Oh, no.
[21:54.630 --> 21:54.870]  Yeah.
[21:55.730 --> 21:56.630]  How the fuck?
[21:56.870 --> 21:57.110]  Ow, ow.
[21:59.050 --> 21:59.710]  Let me live.
[22:00.350 --> 22:01.050]  I just wanna live.
[22:01.250 --> 22:01.570]  Don't hit me.
[22:01.690 --> 22:02.290]  Don't hit me with sticks.
[22:02.910 --> 22:03.630]  What am I supposed to do?
[22:04.250 --> 22:05.570]  Just hold, okay, I got you, I got you.
[22:06.370 --> 22:06.910]  Gavin, you're back.
[22:07.010 --> 22:07.350]  Where the hell are the downstairs?
[22:07.650 --> 22:07.870]  Thanks.
[22:08.530 --> 22:08.710]  Yep.
[22:09.510 --> 22:09.830]  Shit.
[22:10.130 --> 22:10.870]  I don't think that's where you have to go.
[22:10.870 --> 22:11.310]  Shit, shit, shit.
[22:12.250 --> 22:14.390]  Oh, there they are.
[22:14.410 --> 22:14.770]  I think.
[22:15.030 --> 22:15.490]  No, that's the bathroom.
[22:15.650 --> 22:16.230]  Ooh, ooh, ooh, careful.
[22:16.490 --> 22:17.270]  Don't, why are you running?
[22:18.350 --> 22:19.530]  Well, we're out now, aren't we?
[22:20.950 --> 22:21.530]  I am.
[22:22.270 --> 22:25.030]  I don't know where to find the stairs, help me.
[22:26.230 --> 22:28.610]  Isn't there a big flushing arrow to tell you where to go?
[22:30.270 --> 22:30.670]  No.
[22:31.550 --> 22:31.950]  Oh.
[22:32.090 --> 22:33.730]  Yeah, I mean, yes.
[22:35.370 --> 22:36.390]  Are you watching the stream?
[22:36.650 --> 22:37.050]  Where is it?
[22:37.750 --> 22:39.150]  Mine has a giant arrow.
[22:41.410 --> 22:42.510]  Oh, there it is, I found it.
[22:43.030 --> 22:43.970]  There's no arrow, though.
[22:44.550 --> 22:45.590]  It's big and arrow-y.
[22:46.910 --> 22:47.790]  I got no arrow.
[22:48.170 --> 22:49.350]  Just gotta wait for Nick.
[22:50.330 --> 22:52.750]  Chat, how's it going watching Nick play this game?
[22:54.110 --> 22:54.490]  I'm dead.
[22:54.710 --> 22:55.170]  Help me.
[22:55.170 --> 22:56.570]  Oh, we gotta go back in the game, have we?
[22:57.430 --> 22:58.530]  Son of a bitch.
[22:58.950 --> 23:00.070]  I'm on the second floor, help me.
[23:00.370 --> 23:00.770]  Nick.
[23:01.310 --> 23:01.550]  How?
[23:01.890 --> 23:02.630]  I'm staying because I have the violin.
[23:02.630 --> 23:03.830]  I couldn't find the goddamn stairs,
[23:03.930 --> 23:04.910]  there's no arrow for me.
[23:06.370 --> 23:07.970]  Andrew, you're staying because you have the violin.
[23:08.410 --> 23:11.290]  Yeah, so I don't know what happens if he dies, dies,
[23:11.470 --> 23:13.350]  but it's like we just progress.
[23:13.970 --> 23:14.730]  It's very lapidated.
[23:15.010 --> 23:16.890]  I'll try to get to you in 30 seconds.
[23:20.210 --> 23:20.730]  30.
[23:21.410 --> 23:22.290]  Ah, shit.
[23:22.610 --> 23:23.010]  Oh, Gavin.
[23:23.570 --> 23:25.610]  26, 25, Gavin's getting hit.
[23:27.650 --> 23:28.890]  22, 21.
[23:29.210 --> 23:31.290]  Yeah, Nick, I see it on my screen.
[23:31.490 --> 23:33.230]  You don't have to let me know you died.
[23:34.410 --> 23:35.190]  I know I died.
[23:38.470 --> 23:39.290]  I agree.
[23:43.590 --> 23:45.750]  Oh, that's nice of him to give us the fractions.
[23:45.810 --> 23:46.290]  Oh, it's the wrong way.
[23:46.710 --> 23:47.890]  Yeah, goodbye, friends.
[23:49.110 --> 23:50.730]  There's a woman standing over my corpse.
[23:52.810 --> 23:53.170]  Gimlet.
[23:54.710 --> 23:55.410]  I'm back?
[23:55.590 --> 23:56.090]  Oh, I have a lot.
[23:56.170 --> 23:56.350]  Okay.
[23:58.450 --> 23:59.050]  Back in.
[23:59.750 --> 24:00.930]  There's money on my corpse.
[24:01.670 --> 24:02.390]  Yeah, there is.
[24:02.470 --> 24:03.450]  You came back to life upstairs?
[24:04.130 --> 24:04.310]  Yep.
[24:04.590 --> 24:04.730]  Yep.
[24:06.370 --> 24:07.090]  Oh, vent.
[24:08.550 --> 24:11.090]  You know how to get out now, or are you equally stuck?
[24:13.210 --> 24:14.250]  Uh, I have an idea.
[24:14.370 --> 24:14.750]  I died.
[24:14.850 --> 24:15.270]  He's stuck.
[24:18.030 --> 24:18.430]  How?
[24:18.730 --> 24:20.510]  Are you dead dead, or can I help you down?
[24:20.670 --> 24:21.670]  Now it's giving me an arrow.
[24:22.630 --> 24:23.050]  You've got it.
[24:23.050 --> 24:24.130]  It was literally not before.
[24:24.290 --> 24:25.710]  The whole chat contest.
[24:26.070 --> 24:27.990]  There's a huge button that says respawn.
[24:28.890 --> 24:30.110]  I'm just trying to get him to help Eric,
[24:30.210 --> 24:31.790]  but there's a man looking at our van.
[24:33.330 --> 24:33.730]  Ow.
[24:34.750 --> 24:36.090]  A man looking at our van?
[24:36.370 --> 24:37.790]  Yeah, there's a security guy, Gavin.
[24:38.230 --> 24:40.130]  Gavin kind of baited the security guy
[24:40.130 --> 24:41.410]  to just watch over the van.
[24:45.090 --> 24:46.270]  I've decided just to run.
[24:46.270 --> 24:47.310]  You see that arrow, Nick?
[24:48.650 --> 24:50.450]  Yeah, the arrow is here now.
[24:51.750 --> 24:52.990]  It was not here before.
[24:53.290 --> 24:53.770]  I said that.
[24:54.010 --> 24:55.210]  Hey, Nick, whatever you say, man.
[24:55.410 --> 24:55.770]  Absolutely.
[24:58.790 --> 25:01.090]  Chat, comments, if you're watching this later,
[25:01.150 --> 25:01.750]  there was no arrow.
[25:05.650 --> 25:06.970]  Why is this man here?
[25:07.070 --> 25:07.690]  Because Gavin.
[25:09.350 --> 25:10.170]  Okay, bumping him.
[25:11.090 --> 25:11.810]  Oh, shit.
[25:12.250 --> 25:12.730]  Oh, you got it.
[25:12.850 --> 25:14.390]  I thought you got eviscerated by the man.
[25:15.110 --> 25:16.070]  No, I got it.
[25:16.070 --> 25:17.410]  Both things I think were true.
[25:18.170 --> 25:19.030]  I'm on my way.
[25:20.230 --> 25:20.630]  I'll be there shortly.
[25:20.630 --> 25:21.810]  There was no arrow, can't confirm.
[25:23.190 --> 25:24.350]  Oh, but recovery one says
[25:24.350 --> 25:26.090]  there was totally an arrow the whole time.
[25:26.390 --> 25:27.250]  Yeah, exactly.
[25:28.970 --> 25:30.490]  Don't listen to those fucks.
[25:30.810 --> 25:31.830]  They're the same ones who are like,
[25:31.830 --> 25:33.290]  oh, I can't hear Geoff.
[25:34.370 --> 25:35.330]  From the south?
[25:36.730 --> 25:37.970]  Geoff's got no audio.
[25:38.410 --> 25:39.550]  I like Minji Nick.
[25:41.670 --> 25:44.430]  Nick, this game is a totally different Nick.
[25:44.510 --> 25:46.130]  This is like a totally different guy.
[25:46.970 --> 25:48.850]  I just, I lost it.
[25:49.050 --> 25:51.050]  You've never had it.
[25:51.750 --> 25:53.150]  Yeah, in this game, sure.
[25:54.650 --> 25:58.110]  You fell apart from like, from like move one, dude.
[25:58.710 --> 26:00.790]  Yeah, I mean, you know.
[26:01.750 --> 26:04.230]  Rail on eight, nine, eight says Gim Nick.
[26:06.010 --> 26:07.430]  There, mission complete.
[26:07.770 --> 26:08.210]  God.
[26:08.470 --> 26:08.690]  Wow.
[26:10.970 --> 26:12.410]  Oh, we missed two coins, huh?
[26:12.690 --> 26:13.750]  When do I get the shotgun?
[26:17.370 --> 26:19.110]  I just want to upgrade again.
[26:20.670 --> 26:23.110]  I'm such a big fan of the chat arguing about
[26:23.110 --> 26:24.490]  if there were arrows or not.
[26:25.050 --> 26:25.830]  There were not arrows.
[26:26.910 --> 26:27.690]  That's not what somebody,
[26:27.850 --> 26:29.290]  that's not what some people in the chat are saying.
[26:29.390 --> 26:30.250]  I'm just letting you know.
[26:30.910 --> 26:33.470]  I'm just letting you know that they're wrong.
[26:34.330 --> 26:35.190]  I was going to be mean,
[26:35.210 --> 26:36.390]  and then I decided not to be mean.
[26:36.510 --> 26:37.750]  Are you eating right now?
[26:37.750 --> 26:39.530]  No, I have a cough drop.
[26:41.150 --> 26:41.710]  That's it.
[26:41.770 --> 26:42.150]  You know what?
[26:42.310 --> 26:43.230]  I appreciate it.
[26:44.270 --> 26:44.710]  What?
[26:45.090 --> 26:47.650]  That you're thinking of how you're sounding on the stream.
[26:48.890 --> 26:49.770]  While you're screeching.
[26:50.050 --> 26:51.530]  I'm thinking of how my throat feels right now.
[26:55.230 --> 26:57.070]  All right, you guys ready for this new level?
[26:57.870 --> 26:58.890]  Let's do it.
[27:00.050 --> 27:01.410]  Down to the basement first,
[27:01.490 --> 27:03.450]  grab the key to the foreman's office,
[27:04.030 --> 27:07.730]  then go upstairs and do a little hacky hacky
[27:07.730 --> 27:10.130]  on the boss computer's jaw.
[27:11.290 --> 27:14.610]  Cosmo and Gimlet back at it, back in action.
[27:14.790 --> 27:15.930]  Let's fucking do this thing.
[27:16.190 --> 27:17.210]  We are upgrading.
[27:18.130 --> 27:20.590]  Oh, I don't have enough diamonds to upgrade.
[27:20.590 --> 27:23.170]  Did you say jaw instead of yaw?
[27:23.910 --> 27:24.470]  Jaw.
[27:28.610 --> 27:29.170]  Jaw.
[27:30.090 --> 27:31.090]  Yeah, sure.
[27:31.790 --> 27:31.970]  Yeah.
[27:31.970 --> 27:33.250]  Like as a rule.
[27:34.530 --> 27:34.670]  Yeah.
[27:36.070 --> 27:36.990]  Yeah, jaw rules.
[27:37.130 --> 27:37.610]  There's a lot of floors.
[27:38.870 --> 27:39.290]  Okay.
[27:39.590 --> 27:40.650]  Oh, there's also a basement.
[27:40.830 --> 27:44.890]  So it looks like, are there, there's no elevators.
[27:45.090 --> 27:47.130]  There's a big, oh, there is an employee wellness center
[27:47.130 --> 27:49.210]  next to a giant toxic waste room.
[27:49.590 --> 27:50.450]  What the fuck?
[27:52.390 --> 27:55.270]  So we have to go into this recycling room.
[27:55.950 --> 27:57.370]  You see that green key?
[27:57.410 --> 27:59.110]  We have to get that, either that
[27:59.110 --> 28:02.990]  or the truck dispatch key in order to go down
[28:02.990 --> 28:04.090]  to get the foreman key.
[28:05.610 --> 28:06.050]  Damn.
[28:06.850 --> 28:08.130]  All right, let's do this thing.
[28:09.410 --> 28:09.850]  Complicated.
[28:10.510 --> 28:11.170]  Let's do it.
[28:12.090 --> 28:14.370]  I have to go make things.
[28:16.650 --> 28:17.090]  Crossbow?
[28:17.570 --> 28:18.370]  Oh, hell yeah.
[28:18.490 --> 28:19.130]  Now we're talking.
[28:19.430 --> 28:19.710]  I'll be taking that.
[28:19.810 --> 28:20.530]  All right, you guys cry.
[28:20.590 --> 28:21.430]  I'm not getting a crossbow.
[28:21.450 --> 28:22.070]  I'm scared of that.
[28:22.410 --> 28:22.970]  10 arrows.
[28:23.070 --> 28:24.170]  I want a body count of three arrows.
[28:24.170 --> 28:24.970]  Oh, you got the dog.
[28:25.550 --> 28:26.310]  I got the shot.
[28:26.510 --> 28:27.490]  I got fucking Gimlet, bro.
[28:27.810 --> 28:31.270]  Are they sleepy arrows or goodbye forever arrows?
[28:31.470 --> 28:32.750]  I think they're probably sleepy arrows.
[28:34.470 --> 28:35.230]  Let's find out.
[28:35.270 --> 28:37.030]  Oh no, I meant to put in a sleepy arrow,
[28:37.190 --> 28:39.410]  but instead it was my goodbye forever arrows.
[28:39.650 --> 28:40.010]  Oh, wow.
[28:40.190 --> 28:40.750]  They're sleepy arrows.
[28:41.110 --> 28:42.390]  They are sleepy arrows.
[28:44.850 --> 28:45.730]  Eli Benege.
[28:45.830 --> 28:47.150]  Oh, you just punched him in the face.
[28:47.990 --> 28:48.250]  Damn.
[28:48.450 --> 28:48.950]  I just beat him up.
[28:50.050 --> 28:51.590]  Look at the blood all over the floor.
[28:51.790 --> 28:52.830]  Hey, check this out.
[28:53.090 --> 28:53.310]  Gavin.
[28:54.150 --> 28:54.450]  Yeah.
[28:54.630 --> 28:56.370]  You can stand over this guy.
[28:58.190 --> 28:58.930]  Oh, shit.
[28:59.190 --> 28:59.750]  What is that?
[28:59.830 --> 29:00.750]  What do you think that icon is?
[29:00.930 --> 29:02.150]  Oh, oh, put him over here.
[29:02.170 --> 29:02.670]  Put him over here.
[29:03.530 --> 29:04.450]  Can you throw him in the bin?
[29:04.910 --> 29:05.170]  Yeah.
[29:05.550 --> 29:07.770]  I like that Andrew is just not fucking around.
[29:07.910 --> 29:08.230]  Ow.
[29:08.230 --> 29:09.770]  I just got nipped by...
[29:09.770 --> 29:10.410]  Oh, I went in the bin.
[29:10.410 --> 29:11.050]  Oh, there's a guy.
[29:11.850 --> 29:12.550]  Don't worry, I'll distract.
[29:12.710 --> 29:13.010]  I'll distract.
[29:13.150 --> 29:13.830]  You're good, you're good, you're good.
[29:14.350 --> 29:14.570]  Gimlet.
[29:15.190 --> 29:16.430]  Gimlet distraction activated.
[29:16.890 --> 29:18.270]  I tried to put the guy in the bin,
[29:18.310 --> 29:19.070]  but I went in the bin.
[29:19.390 --> 29:19.990]  Yeah, I saw that.
[29:20.050 --> 29:20.650]  He's in the bin now.
[29:21.670 --> 29:21.990]  Good.
[29:23.110 --> 29:25.130]  So Andrew, you can just lamp people in the face.
[29:25.230 --> 29:27.270]  Well, who's this giant character now?
[29:27.270 --> 29:28.570]  Andrew, did you change characters?
[29:28.870 --> 29:30.630]  I had to, they didn't let me pick.
[29:31.130 --> 29:33.830]  Like each job, I guess, has a specific set of four
[29:33.830 --> 29:34.530]  that you can play as.
[29:36.650 --> 29:38.050]  Well, your one's cooler.
[29:39.210 --> 29:39.710]  Oh my God.
[29:39.870 --> 29:40.230]  Oh, nice.
[29:40.350 --> 29:41.110]  Nice sleeper.
[29:42.070 --> 29:43.670]  Andrew is not messing around.
[29:44.030 --> 29:44.190]  Shoot.
[29:44.370 --> 29:44.470]  I'll bin him.
[29:44.750 --> 29:45.210]  I got him.
[29:45.730 --> 29:46.030]  Bin him.
[29:46.890 --> 29:49.190]  How do you put them in the bin without you in the bin?
[29:49.650 --> 29:50.350]  I don't know.
[29:50.830 --> 29:52.290]  Cause I definitely got in the bin.
[29:53.190 --> 29:54.790]  Shit, Andrew, jeez.
[29:55.350 --> 29:55.650]  Dude.
[29:55.650 --> 29:57.410]  I'm just cleaning up after Andrew.
[29:57.830 --> 29:59.130]  Hey, sneaking or cleaning up.
[29:59.570 --> 30:02.350]  Eli Ben- Benej, Benay, Ben- Benji.
[30:02.550 --> 30:03.130]  Jeez.
[30:03.650 --> 30:04.010]  Fuck.
[30:04.210 --> 30:06.870]  Another rail of 50 gifted.
[30:07.010 --> 30:07.810]  Oh my God.
[30:08.150 --> 30:11.570]  50 gifted from Eli Benj, crazy.
[30:12.030 --> 30:12.990]  Crazy out here.
[30:13.630 --> 30:14.250]  Thank you, Eli.
[30:14.690 --> 30:16.050]  That's a chunky packet.
[30:16.310 --> 30:16.910]  Checkpoint.
[30:16.930 --> 30:17.810]  It's getting wild out here.
[30:17.990 --> 30:18.490]  Help guys.
[30:18.570 --> 30:19.490]  Holy shit.
[30:19.730 --> 30:20.090]  Where are you?
[30:20.430 --> 30:20.770]  Hiya!
[30:23.370 --> 30:24.170]  How'd it go?
[30:24.170 --> 30:24.910]  Oh, dog.
[30:25.150 --> 30:25.670]  Yeah, gimlet.
[30:25.910 --> 30:27.050]  Gimlet distraction, bitch.
[30:28.930 --> 30:29.330]  Gimlet.
[30:29.530 --> 30:30.070]  Is it dog?
[30:30.230 --> 30:31.950]  Is that the most subs we've ever had dropped?
[30:32.390 --> 30:32.770]  That was nutty.
[30:32.790 --> 30:33.290]  It has to be.
[30:33.950 --> 30:34.570]  That was crazy.
[30:35.630 --> 30:36.970]  Eli, you're crazy, son.
[30:37.650 --> 30:38.050]  Yeah.
[30:38.410 --> 30:39.410]  You lost it.
[30:39.850 --> 30:41.130]  Bro, you're out of control, bro.
[30:41.970 --> 30:42.750]  You got the key?
[30:43.110 --> 30:43.950]  Oh shit, you did.
[30:44.690 --> 30:46.170]  Where do you think this vent takes us?
[30:47.710 --> 30:48.390]  Let's find out.
[30:48.650 --> 30:49.030]  You wanna find it?
[30:50.050 --> 30:50.250]  Whoops.
[30:50.510 --> 30:50.630]  Wee!
[30:50.630 --> 30:51.510]  Me and Gavin are in the vent.
[30:51.770 --> 30:52.670]  We're racing in the vent.
[30:52.670 --> 30:53.210]  Glingle.
[30:54.050 --> 30:54.570]  Oh.
[30:54.950 --> 30:55.930]  Right back here.
[30:56.790 --> 30:57.410]  Where'd it take you?
[30:57.990 --> 30:58.670]  Right here.
[31:00.310 --> 31:01.770]  That was worth it.
[31:02.090 --> 31:02.290]  Weird.
[31:03.430 --> 31:03.670]  Ooh.
[31:05.190 --> 31:05.990]  Guy here.
[31:06.490 --> 31:07.730]  Distraction, gimlet, distraction.
[31:09.010 --> 31:09.350]  Good job, gimlet.
[31:09.350 --> 31:10.490]  Gimlet ran under the...
[31:10.950 --> 31:11.930]  Oh, he's very small.
[31:12.050 --> 31:13.030]  Gimlet's very small.
[31:13.570 --> 31:14.790]  That's what makes him so cute.
[31:17.210 --> 31:17.990]  Andrew's hacking.
[31:18.750 --> 31:20.190]  Oh no, you're just turning on a...
[31:20.190 --> 31:21.350]  I'm turning these off.
[31:21.590 --> 31:22.230]  Oh, Gavin.
[31:22.230 --> 31:23.630]  Oh, Gavin.
[31:24.170 --> 31:24.670]  Go to sleep.
[31:25.430 --> 31:25.570]  Yep.
[31:29.430 --> 31:31.970]  Andrew, what if you punch the guy I'm carrying?
[31:35.450 --> 31:37.190]  I don't see you carrying anybody.
[31:37.330 --> 31:37.490]  Oh.
[31:38.470 --> 31:38.810]  Nothing.
[31:39.550 --> 31:39.870]  Oh, okay.
[31:42.590 --> 31:44.510]  Oh, let's wake...
[31:44.510 --> 31:45.070]  Uh-oh!
[31:45.410 --> 31:45.730]  Gimlet!
[31:47.230 --> 31:47.910]  There we go.
[31:48.270 --> 31:48.850]  Good job, gimlet.
[31:50.550 --> 31:51.790]  Can I turn these off permanently?
[31:51.790 --> 31:53.850]  Straight up gimlet, straight up fucking MVP, dude.
[31:54.370 --> 31:55.570]  Uh-oh, the guy woke up.
[31:55.610 --> 31:55.830]  Yeah.
[31:56.270 --> 31:57.130]  Shit, soup.
[31:57.670 --> 31:58.270]  Oh, Gavin!
[31:59.750 --> 32:00.410]  I got him.
[32:00.450 --> 32:00.990]  I'm real hurt.
[32:01.130 --> 32:02.150]  Nice, well done.
[32:03.150 --> 32:03.730]  Thank you.
[32:04.110 --> 32:05.990]  I wanna just be able to punch people.
[32:07.290 --> 32:07.610]  Yeah.
[32:08.310 --> 32:08.930]  Ooh, coffee.
[32:12.640 --> 32:13.700]  Did coffee do anything?
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.840]  Oh, Gavin, he's up!
[32:16.140 --> 32:16.440]  Oh shit.
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.260]  Run.
[32:19.340 --> 32:21.040]  What is, what's the spider icon?
[32:21.360 --> 32:21.860]  Does anyone know what spider does?
[32:21.860 --> 32:22.580]  A hacking, I think.
[32:23.120 --> 32:24.600]  Oh, I did it, I did spider.
[32:25.400 --> 32:26.300]  Spider's always hacked.
[32:26.540 --> 32:26.580]  Sweet.
[32:28.000 --> 32:29.840]  Spider is good when we want it.
[32:30.880 --> 32:33.840]  Oh, Andrew just dropped to that level, interesting.
[32:33.980 --> 32:34.320]  Gavin!
[32:34.700 --> 32:35.100]  Gavin.
[32:35.520 --> 32:35.540]  Oh shit.
[32:37.640 --> 32:40.760]  I landed on the thing.
[32:41.900 --> 32:42.220]  Well, that's not good.
[32:42.220 --> 32:42.480]  Sleep!
[32:45.520 --> 32:46.920]  I think I got away with it.
[32:48.660 --> 32:49.200]  What's this?
[32:49.260 --> 32:50.700]  I still don't know what the spider thing does.
[32:50.720 --> 32:51.320]  I just have it.
[32:56.220 --> 32:57.400]  Oh, there's a spider thing right here.
[32:57.400 --> 32:57.660]  Nice.
[32:58.240 --> 32:59.740]  Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
[32:59.900 --> 33:01.980]  It's, and then you get like a little green deal.
[33:03.800 --> 33:04.160]  Oh.
[33:04.980 --> 33:06.200]  Did this just take us in a circle?
[33:06.840 --> 33:08.720]  It shut the power off in this one, of course.
[33:09.980 --> 33:11.300]  Ooh, I'm going to top up me arrows.
[33:14.660 --> 33:15.700]  Why can't I, why?
[33:16.440 --> 33:17.160]  Oh, what the?
[33:17.680 --> 33:18.940]  There's a guard who came through here.
[33:19.000 --> 33:20.140]  Is that door alarmed?
[33:20.360 --> 33:21.000]  Oh, Andrew!
[33:21.800 --> 33:22.080]  Yep.
[33:22.540 --> 33:23.920]  Ow, I got shot!
[33:24.020 --> 33:25.140]  Who set the thing off?
[33:25.980 --> 33:27.420]  Andrew went through an alarm door.
[33:28.160 --> 33:28.740]  That's cool.
[33:29.000 --> 33:29.080]  Andrew!
[33:29.760 --> 33:31.760]  You gotta learn what certain things mean, you know?
[33:31.840 --> 33:32.300]  I might die.
[33:32.480 --> 33:33.460]  That's an alarm door.
[33:34.380 --> 33:34.740]  Ow!
[33:34.800 --> 33:36.020]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's already gone,
[33:36.160 --> 33:37.820]  so might as well just...
[33:37.820 --> 33:39.220]  No, you're getting, no, I'll die!
[33:40.520 --> 33:41.740]  Oh, I should buy some of this,
[33:41.820 --> 33:45.080]  because I got gobs for brains.
[33:45.220 --> 33:46.140]  Please let me buy.
[33:47.500 --> 33:49.260]  I got, I bought another life for us.
[33:49.740 --> 33:50.320]  Hacking a vault.
[33:51.500 --> 33:52.560]  I got the green key.
[33:53.920 --> 33:55.240]  I'm by the engineer door.
[33:55.320 --> 33:55.500]  Oh!
[33:58.240 --> 33:59.120]  Come on, Gimlet.
[34:00.500 --> 34:01.320]  Oh, shit.
[34:02.560 --> 34:03.860]  I love that he saw you.
[34:04.720 --> 34:05.660]  How did that work?
[34:06.820 --> 34:07.740]  I don't know.
[34:08.700 --> 34:10.400]  The alarm door's back on in here.
[34:10.700 --> 34:12.800]  Electricity is off.
[34:12.820 --> 34:14.320]  Oh, but we can use the vent to get through.
[34:14.320 --> 34:14.580]  We shot you!
[34:15.140 --> 34:16.120]  He shot me.
[34:16.540 --> 34:17.400]  Could you shoot him?
[34:17.400 --> 34:17.620]  Look at that.
[34:18.000 --> 34:19.400]  Or punch the back of his head or something?
[34:19.680 --> 34:20.440]  Got him, got him.
[34:21.340 --> 34:22.100]  Is Ed?
[34:23.520 --> 34:25.220]  You're making fun of me or something?
[34:25.560 --> 34:26.600]  Ha ha ha!
[34:27.220 --> 34:28.000]  Or something.
[34:30.760 --> 34:32.400]  Can you get in here, Andrew?
[34:32.600 --> 34:35.040]  Nope, not without triggering the alarm.
[34:35.340 --> 34:36.760]  Boys, boys, I am finding you.
[34:37.000 --> 34:37.260]  Ah!
[34:37.400 --> 34:38.180]  I triggered it!
[34:38.240 --> 34:38.840]  I triggered it!
[34:38.880 --> 34:39.360]  Just come in!
[34:39.640 --> 34:40.080]  Ow!
[34:40.780 --> 34:41.640]  I'm out of arrows!
[34:41.840 --> 34:42.720]  I opened the door for, oh!
[34:44.100 --> 34:44.860]  Helping Gavin.
[34:45.740 --> 34:47.300]  And now we'll go get you.
[34:49.260 --> 34:49.700]  Owie!
[34:50.200 --> 34:51.400]  There's a guy standing over me.
[34:51.920 --> 34:52.100]  Ah!
[34:55.120 --> 34:56.580]  Oh, that's what that does.
[34:57.440 --> 34:58.060]  What, you can't do that?
[34:58.060 --> 34:58.740]  So, we're gonna back up.
[34:59.740 --> 35:01.440]  Oh, boys, I'm getting, uh-oh.
[35:03.060 --> 35:03.780]  Where did it go?
[35:03.820 --> 35:04.460]  Didn't someone have it?
[35:05.080 --> 35:06.040]  Yeah, Eric has it.
[35:06.060 --> 35:06.800]  We need it over here.
[35:07.260 --> 35:08.260]  I do, I do, I do.
[35:10.340 --> 35:10.700]  I'm...
[35:11.300 --> 35:12.020]  Fuck me.
[35:14.440 --> 35:15.440]  Knock him out.
[35:16.040 --> 35:17.400]  How am I supposed to do this?
[35:20.560 --> 35:22.040]  Oh, you need a third.
[35:23.200 --> 35:24.220]  There's only two here.
[35:24.220 --> 35:25.420]  Oh, we need a third one.
[35:26.520 --> 35:28.240]  These, like, little spider deals,
[35:28.380 --> 35:29.620]  where it's, like, the little hack thing.
[35:31.280 --> 35:34.020]  They can, like, disable cameras and shit.
[35:34.880 --> 35:35.240]  What?
[35:35.980 --> 35:38.500]  And in order to-
[35:38.500 --> 35:39.100]  Let's go back.
[35:39.200 --> 35:40.040]  Damn, in order to get-
[35:40.040 --> 35:40.980]  Oh, he opened the door for us.
[35:41.020 --> 35:41.300]  There we go.
[35:41.320 --> 35:43.440]  In order to get some of, like, this loot-
[35:43.700 --> 35:44.260]  Here we go.
[35:45.980 --> 35:46.520]  Andrew's shattered.
[35:46.700 --> 35:47.200]  Just punched him through.
[35:47.380 --> 35:48.220]  Oh shit, below me.
[35:48.680 --> 35:49.140]  Did you get him?
[35:49.940 --> 35:50.220]  Yeah.
[35:51.280 --> 35:52.220]  He's out again.
[35:52.760 --> 35:53.880]  Oh, he's coming back in.
[35:54.180 --> 35:54.520]  Yes.
[35:55.300 --> 35:56.060]  He's dead again.
[35:56.400 --> 35:57.300]  So much money.
[36:00.340 --> 36:01.600]  Violin Enthusiast says,
[36:01.700 --> 36:03.460]  can't wait for the heist video tomorrow.
[36:03.680 --> 36:05.320]  Be careful what you wish for.
[36:05.760 --> 36:06.260]  Yeah, no kidding.
[36:06.900 --> 36:08.560]  We didn't know what we were in for.
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.380]  We thought we were gonna do that video
[36:10.380 --> 36:14.740]  and then immediately do the next Doomsday Heist intro.
[36:14.960 --> 36:15.120]  Yeah.
[36:15.120 --> 36:17.480]  And, uh, we didn't.
[36:18.040 --> 36:18.920]  We did not.
[36:20.740 --> 36:22.200]  Oh shit, I found a disguise.
[36:24.140 --> 36:26.540]  Well, we'd already recorded one that day, so.
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.420]  Okay, now I look like I work here.
[36:34.680 --> 36:37.940]  Look out for the part where Eric goes completely silent.
[36:39.400 --> 36:40.540]  For three minutes straight.
[36:40.680 --> 36:41.940]  I just, yeah, I just turn it off.
[36:42.020 --> 36:43.380]  I just go, I don't want to do this anymore.
[36:43.940 --> 36:45.400]  Yeah, he, uh.
[36:46.320 --> 36:46.940]  Where does this?
[36:47.120 --> 36:48.900]  And it's not, it's not in the video,
[36:49.020 --> 36:52.300]  but we talked about how after certain incidents,
[36:52.760 --> 36:54.700]  he will deafen in Discord.
[36:54.940 --> 36:56.080]  Yeah, I just don't want to hear you.
[36:56.540 --> 36:57.100]  And I don't want to.
[36:57.100 --> 36:57.840]  He's not muting.
[36:58.000 --> 36:58.260]  Nope.
[36:58.400 --> 36:59.060]  He's not muting.
[36:59.220 --> 37:01.020]  He's turning off everybody around him.
[37:01.020 --> 37:01.180]  Yep.
[37:01.520 --> 37:02.100]  Okay, I got it.
[37:02.160 --> 37:02.740]  Okay, we're all clear.
[37:02.800 --> 37:03.220]  We got the key.
[37:03.360 --> 37:04.020]  Let's get out of here.
[37:04.740 --> 37:05.140]  Yeah, let's go.
[37:05.740 --> 37:06.000]  Alarm door.
[37:06.980 --> 37:07.320]  It's fine.
[37:07.740 --> 37:08.460]  Look out, Kevin!
[37:08.880 --> 37:10.220]  Who went through the alarm door?
[37:11.080 --> 37:11.400]  Andrew.
[37:11.400 --> 37:11.520]  Andrew.
[37:11.940 --> 37:12.260]  Andrew.
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.180]  Yeah, I got him, got him, got him.
[37:14.320 --> 37:14.900]  I'm out of here.
[37:16.600 --> 37:16.940]  That's nice.
[37:17.060 --> 37:17.900]  The arrow's pointing this way.
[37:19.140 --> 37:20.920]  Oh, Nick is the arrow expert, guys.
[37:21.820 --> 37:22.480]  It's here now.
[37:22.840 --> 37:24.700]  If you have any questions about arrows, talk on.
[37:24.940 --> 37:25.760]  Oh, God, Sean.
[37:25.760 --> 37:27.000]  If you have any questions about the arrow, talk to Nick.
[37:27.640 --> 37:28.260]  Pushed him down.
[37:28.420 --> 37:28.820]  Oh, fuck.
[37:29.300 --> 37:30.000]  Andrew's gonna go down.
[37:31.020 --> 37:32.100]  I just beat up three guys.
[37:32.200 --> 37:32.980]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[37:33.100 --> 37:33.380]  I saw, I saw, I saw.
[37:33.420 --> 37:34.360]  Go, go, go, come on.
[37:34.380 --> 37:35.240]  We're good, we're good, we're good.
[37:35.700 --> 37:36.780]  I'm so low on health.
[37:37.080 --> 37:37.560]  Sneak, sneak, sneak.
[37:38.060 --> 37:39.260]  Andrew, let's try and find a bathroom
[37:39.260 --> 37:40.160]  to soak your knuckles.
[37:40.160 --> 37:40.940]  This way.
[37:42.460 --> 37:44.240]  I got blood shooting out of me.
[37:46.260 --> 37:47.740]  You just shot him.
[37:47.800 --> 37:48.720]  All right, here we go.
[37:48.800 --> 37:49.340]  All right, easy.
[37:49.820 --> 37:50.780]  Easy, tease it.
[37:51.700 --> 37:52.360]  There you go.
[37:52.420 --> 37:53.480]  Good disable, good disable.
[37:54.120 --> 37:54.680]  Thank you.
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.960]  Oh balls, that's not what I want.
[38:01.380 --> 38:01.900]  Back it up.
[38:02.400 --> 38:03.440]  Everyone stay there, everyone stay there.
[38:03.660 --> 38:04.100]  I got it.
[38:04.840 --> 38:05.500]  Are you hacking?
[38:06.240 --> 38:07.080]  Yeah, I got this.
[38:09.500 --> 38:10.800]  Okay, time to go.
[38:11.200 --> 38:12.460]  All right, well, close enough, whatever.
[38:12.680 --> 38:13.060]  Sorry.
[38:14.020 --> 38:14.460]  Brutal.
[38:14.980 --> 38:15.240]  Me.
[38:16.900 --> 38:18.120]  Andrew's helping, guys.
[38:18.940 --> 38:21.520]  The alarm just goes off and Andrew just cocks his arm.
[38:21.880 --> 38:23.580]  Just starts swinging.
[38:24.100 --> 38:25.280]  He's dripping everywhere.
[38:25.400 --> 38:26.240]  I had to.
[38:26.360 --> 38:28.260]  Oh, I'm bleeding out, I think, because I got shot.
[38:29.180 --> 38:30.160]  Hang on, wait, stop.
[38:30.360 --> 38:30.820]  You're bleeding out?
[38:30.820 --> 38:31.180]  There you go.
[38:31.520 --> 38:32.340]  Yeah, you got plugged.
[38:32.520 --> 38:33.100]  Here's some coffee.
[38:34.820 --> 38:35.180]  Go.
[38:36.180 --> 38:37.040]  Get that coffee.
[38:37.280 --> 38:38.820]  Oh no, coffee is just moving faster.
[38:38.820 --> 38:40.280]  You want that, you want the hack.
[38:41.120 --> 38:43.060]  I think if you have coffee when you're bleeding out,
[38:43.120 --> 38:44.220]  it's going to make you bleed faster.
[38:45.760 --> 38:46.740]  Maybe in real life.
[38:48.080 --> 38:50.240]  Get those hacks, there you go, just take these out.
[38:51.280 --> 38:51.460]  Yeah.
[38:52.400 --> 38:52.940]  All right, let's go.
[38:52.940 --> 38:54.240]  I'm just wailing on people.
[38:56.360 --> 38:56.880]  Oh God.
[39:00.800 --> 39:01.520]  Fucking die.
[39:02.080 --> 39:03.160]  Don't worry, the dog likes them.
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.200]  There we go, all disabled.
[39:05.540 --> 39:06.520]  Oh, they like the dog.
[39:06.660 --> 39:07.100]  Let me get one here.
[39:09.940 --> 39:11.360]  Is that, is that a...
[39:11.360 --> 39:11.860]  Oh shit.
[39:12.000 --> 39:12.600]  That worked.
[39:12.840 --> 39:13.880]  It came through the window.
[39:14.120 --> 39:14.920]  Oh shit.
[39:17.320 --> 39:17.720]  Andrew.
[39:18.000 --> 39:18.920]  Guys, Andrew's down.
[39:19.740 --> 39:20.140]  Oh God.
[39:20.380 --> 39:21.640]  There's like health right here too.
[39:22.940 --> 39:23.740]  Oh, there's a spider.
[39:25.480 --> 39:25.880]  Good hack.
[39:26.960 --> 39:27.780]  Oh, nice.
[39:30.440 --> 39:32.360]  I wonder if I should buy health, I probably should.
[39:33.200 --> 39:34.340]  I mean, there's health over here.
[39:37.820 --> 39:38.180]  Crossbow.
[39:39.480 --> 39:40.220]  What's this about?
[39:40.280 --> 39:40.940]  Can we go out this way?
[39:41.040 --> 39:41.240]  Nope.
[39:41.520 --> 39:41.660]  All right.
[39:41.780 --> 39:42.360]  That's a hide.
[39:43.200 --> 39:43.400]  Oh.
[39:44.100 --> 39:44.460]  Who has the key?
[39:44.480 --> 39:45.660]  There's, there's health right here.
[39:46.660 --> 39:48.280]  Oh, I guess it's recharging, I'm sorry.
[39:51.600 --> 39:53.320]  Andrew, don't get up from your desk.
[39:53.640 --> 39:54.460]  We're a key short.
[39:55.960 --> 39:56.320]  Fuck.
[39:56.560 --> 39:56.840]  Sweet.
[39:58.440 --> 39:59.420]  Oh, it's up there.
[40:00.800 --> 40:01.460]  Oh, balls.
[40:02.180 --> 40:03.140]  And just swing your way through, huh?
[40:05.700 --> 40:06.060]  Ow.
[40:07.520 --> 40:07.880]  Ow.
[40:08.720 --> 40:10.020]  There, I got the power out.
[40:11.560 --> 40:12.040]  Got it.
[40:12.220 --> 40:13.460]  There's, there's health right here, Gavin.
[40:14.440 --> 40:15.180]  I've got health.
[40:15.860 --> 40:16.260]  Oh, okay.
[40:16.320 --> 40:17.280]  I thought you needed some, sorry.
[40:17.740 --> 40:18.080]  Oh, I did.
[40:18.300 --> 40:19.540]  Oh, I bought it.
[40:22.180 --> 40:22.600]  There you go, Andrew.
[40:23.100 --> 40:23.500]  Thank you.
[40:23.960 --> 40:26.280]  All right, bringing the key.
[40:27.080 --> 40:27.440]  Nice.
[40:28.600 --> 40:29.100]  What's in?
[40:30.460 --> 40:30.820]  Hacking?
[40:31.820 --> 40:33.120]  Nick is just like doing it.
[40:33.120 --> 40:33.960]  Hacking stuff, it's fun.
[40:34.260 --> 40:34.540]  No.
[40:35.760 --> 40:37.320]  Why did you say no?
[40:37.880 --> 40:38.420]  Should we go upstairs?
[40:38.560 --> 40:38.920]  Because I wasn't.
[40:41.400 --> 40:42.380]  Nick is doing stuff.
[40:42.520 --> 40:42.780]  No.
[40:44.220 --> 40:45.240]  Anything cool up there?
[40:45.640 --> 40:46.740]  Not bad stuff.
[40:46.880 --> 40:47.420]  I'm getting coins.
[40:48.840 --> 40:49.660]  There's another band.
[40:50.360 --> 40:51.340]  Health, that's good.
[40:51.520 --> 40:52.120]  All right, come on through.
[40:52.520 --> 40:54.660]  Can we, can you punch the trumpeter?
[40:55.500 --> 40:55.780]  Nope.
[40:56.220 --> 40:57.080]  Or the tromboneman?
[40:57.440 --> 40:57.860]  Nope.
[40:58.020 --> 40:58.340]  Oh, balls.
[40:58.880 --> 40:59.620]  How you doing over there, Nick?
[41:00.580 --> 41:00.860]  I'm good.
[41:01.200 --> 41:02.420]  I don't know why a trumpet
[41:02.420 --> 41:04.140]  is more famous than a trombone.
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.080]  You're lucky.
[41:05.180 --> 41:06.460]  I feel like it's usually a trombone.
[41:08.920 --> 41:09.480]  Come on.
[41:09.940 --> 41:10.360]  Okay.
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.220]  Hang on.
[41:14.680 --> 41:16.120]  There you go, let's go.
[41:17.240 --> 41:18.200]  You bow out and let's go.
[41:19.900 --> 41:20.600]  Oh shit.
[41:21.400 --> 41:22.000]  Nope, wrong way.
[41:23.140 --> 41:23.860]  Ooh, coin.
[41:25.720 --> 41:26.600]  All right, Gimlet's got them.
[41:27.080 --> 41:27.520]  Good.
[41:28.360 --> 41:29.940]  Where are we supposed to be heading?
[41:30.220 --> 41:30.460]  Up?
[41:30.620 --> 41:31.040]  Over here.
[41:32.200 --> 41:32.560]  Shit.
[41:33.880 --> 41:34.220]  You're fine.
[41:36.040 --> 41:36.560]  I see.
[41:36.760 --> 41:38.180]  Ooh, I'm gonna hack a little.
[41:38.180 --> 41:38.680]  Yeah, hack that.
[41:39.940 --> 41:40.440]  I see.
[41:40.860 --> 41:41.280]  All right, let's go.
[41:41.880 --> 41:43.240]  All right, we're making our way upstairs.
[41:43.300 --> 41:43.400]  Can I play trombone?
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.020]  Can I play trombone?
[41:47.040 --> 41:48.260]  That's, that's, oh, here we go.
[41:48.320 --> 41:49.380]  It's hacked, it's hacked.
[41:49.740 --> 41:50.500]  Come on, come on, Nick.
[41:51.820 --> 41:52.180]  Wee.
[41:53.300 --> 41:54.720]  I blew three arrows on that guy.
[41:55.100 --> 41:57.100]  I'm going, I'm going money door to get the disguise.
[41:57.960 --> 41:59.460]  All right, I'm gonna get the arrows.
[41:59.700 --> 41:59.880]  Sure.
[42:01.280 --> 42:02.720]  There's a hack also, get that.
[42:03.880 --> 42:04.560]  Hack at the top.
[42:04.960 --> 42:05.660]  Hack at the top.
[42:05.820 --> 42:06.680]  Oh, it's in a weird spot.
[42:06.820 --> 42:07.680]  Nope, other one over here.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.820]  Oh, I didn't even see that one.
[42:10.600 --> 42:11.380]  I got it.
[42:14.220 --> 42:14.720]  Yee-haw.
[42:16.400 --> 42:17.940]  We're on the move, we're doing good.
[42:18.360 --> 42:20.880]  Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[42:21.660 --> 42:22.020]  You good?
[42:23.000 --> 42:23.480]  You all right?
[42:23.660 --> 42:24.900]  Hey, hey, all right.
[42:25.040 --> 42:25.640]  All right, hang on.
[42:25.720 --> 42:26.440]  Okay, slow down.
[42:26.620 --> 42:27.280]  Let's take it slow.
[42:27.640 --> 42:28.300]  We're all right.
[42:28.720 --> 42:29.800]  There's no reason to rush.
[42:29.800 --> 42:33.020]  Except, yeah, there's a bunch of stuff right there.
[42:33.760 --> 42:34.380]  Where?
[42:35.060 --> 42:35.640]  Right there.
[42:37.140 --> 42:37.760]  Ooh.
[42:37.860 --> 42:38.360]  Right here, baby.
[42:39.820 --> 42:41.060]  Money time.
[42:42.740 --> 42:43.360]  Buntz.
[42:44.000 --> 42:44.900]  Buntz Supreme.
[42:45.280 --> 42:45.560]  Buntz.
[42:48.420 --> 42:50.380]  I'm a little stuck behind it.
[42:50.460 --> 42:50.780]  There you go.
[42:52.340 --> 42:53.820]  I think we should go up.
[42:55.140 --> 42:56.260]  Past the dog.
[42:56.920 --> 42:57.800]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.960]  I think it's up is gonna be different.
[43:00.120 --> 43:01.900]  No, no, no, we gotta go to where Andrew is, I think.
[43:02.500 --> 43:02.860]  Yeah.
[43:04.500 --> 43:05.620]  Gavin, you need to join us.
[43:06.600 --> 43:07.880]  I was just following the arrow.
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.720]  But there's gonna be more stuff up here.
[43:12.960 --> 43:13.680]  Oh, yeah.
[43:17.030 --> 43:18.730]  Well, when you put it that way, it sounds great.
[43:18.950 --> 43:19.290]  Oh shit.
[43:20.110 --> 43:20.590]  Oh shit.
[43:20.750 --> 43:21.930]  Here's a hack.
[43:23.070 --> 43:24.250]  I dived out the window.
[43:24.870 --> 43:26.510]  Giant safe, giant safe.
[43:30.150 --> 43:30.510]  Ugh.
[43:33.770 --> 43:34.470]  Giant safe.
[43:34.750 --> 43:36.110]  Money, money, money, money, money, money, money,
[43:36.350 --> 43:36.810]  money, money, money, money, money.
[43:37.950 --> 43:38.490]  What's this?
[43:40.750 --> 43:41.470]  Oh shit.
[43:44.470 --> 43:45.410]  Oh, the door.
[43:45.610 --> 43:46.330]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[43:46.810 --> 43:47.250]  Come on, Nick.
[43:48.170 --> 43:48.450]  Up.
[43:48.930 --> 43:49.450]  Just run.
[43:51.530 --> 43:52.470]  Come on, we're with Gavin.
[43:52.730 --> 43:53.110]  We're with Gavin.
[43:53.450 --> 43:54.330]  Gavin's like out there.
[43:54.690 --> 43:55.190]  I'm in the van.
[43:57.370 --> 43:58.550]  I just jumped off the roof.
[43:59.650 --> 43:59.970]  How?
[44:01.710 --> 44:02.570]  Just walked off.
[44:03.290 --> 44:03.650]  Oh, okay.
[44:11.350 --> 44:11.670]  Ow.
[44:12.910 --> 44:13.350]  Uh-oh.
[44:13.930 --> 44:14.250]  Ow!
[44:14.430 --> 44:14.770]  Got you.
[44:17.430 --> 44:18.370]  You're good, you're good, you're fine.
[44:19.150 --> 44:19.850]  I know, I'm okay.
[44:20.450 --> 44:20.950]  I'm all right.
[44:21.150 --> 44:21.850]  All right, gang, let's do it.
[44:26.750 --> 44:27.070]  Gimlet.
[44:27.190 --> 44:27.610]  What, are you going out a window?
[44:30.370 --> 44:31.290]  Hey, let's go.
[44:33.070 --> 44:37.010]  Eric, how much for you to legally change your name to Gimlet?
[44:38.070 --> 44:39.350]  Oh, I don't think I could do it.
[44:39.550 --> 44:40.850]  I don't think I could be a Gimlet.
[44:41.030 --> 44:42.230]  I'm not built to be a Gimlet.
[44:42.890 --> 44:43.630]  Gimlet Badour?
[44:44.310 --> 44:45.590]  Yeah, I don't think I'm built for a Gimlet.
[44:47.090 --> 44:48.290]  All right, boys, here we go.
[44:48.530 --> 44:49.550]  I'm jumping down.
[44:50.250 --> 44:50.970]  And we're in the van.
[44:51.630 --> 44:52.210]  Here I come.
[44:52.510 --> 44:54.250]  Gimlet distraction style, baby.
[44:54.310 --> 44:54.870]  Let's do it.
[44:57.330 --> 44:58.130]  Big Gimlet.
[45:00.270 --> 45:01.170]  Did we just...
[45:01.170 --> 45:02.310]  Oh, we're fucking doing it, baby.
[45:02.390 --> 45:02.910]  This is it.
[45:04.350 --> 45:05.350]  We're rocking and rolling.
[45:06.250 --> 45:06.630]  Easy.
[45:06.970 --> 45:09.150]  Holy shit, Eli Bench.
[45:09.550 --> 45:13.190]  Dude, this is quite a hundred gifted subs.
[45:13.550 --> 45:13.690]  What?
[45:14.090 --> 45:14.130]  What?
[45:15.290 --> 45:15.730]  Wow.
[45:16.570 --> 45:16.770]  What?
[45:17.050 --> 45:18.150]  You're out of your mind.
[45:18.150 --> 45:18.990]  That's not insane.
[45:20.950 --> 45:21.750]  Holy shit.
[45:21.750 --> 45:22.790]  Thank you so much.
[45:23.210 --> 45:24.630]  I'll even go this far.
[45:24.770 --> 45:26.130]  Throw him some piss rats in the chat.
[45:26.410 --> 45:27.950]  I'll even give it up for the piss rats.
[45:27.970 --> 45:28.110]  What?
[45:28.110 --> 45:29.390]  That's crazy.
[45:29.810 --> 45:32.130]  He went turbo Bench.
[45:33.010 --> 45:33.430]  Wow.
[45:34.270 --> 45:35.110]  Oh my God.
[45:35.310 --> 45:35.730]  Dude.
[45:35.830 --> 45:36.870]  Thank you so much, Eli.
[45:37.170 --> 45:40.350]  Eli, this heist is dedicated to you.
[45:40.450 --> 45:41.130]  Thank you very much.
[45:41.550 --> 45:42.190]  Appreciate you.
[45:43.830 --> 45:44.270]  Holy.
[45:45.290 --> 45:45.730]  Damn.
[45:46.410 --> 45:47.510]  Are you guys ready for one more?
[45:47.590 --> 45:48.870]  You guys want to get into the cocktail party?
[45:49.230 --> 45:50.290]  Let's do number four.
[45:50.530 --> 45:51.510]  We're gonna go to 501.
[45:51.710 --> 45:53.290]  I'm just, I'm Benched out over here.
[45:53.410 --> 45:54.050]  I just got Benched.
[45:54.070 --> 45:54.430]  Yeah, this is crazy.
[45:56.130 --> 45:57.550]  So it looks like...
[45:58.030 --> 46:00.570]  Potentially like they're swapping some people in and out.
[46:01.630 --> 46:01.850]  Yeah.
[46:02.210 --> 46:02.410]  Yeah.
[46:03.050 --> 46:04.030]  The crew changes.
[46:04.050 --> 46:04.490]  Okay, let's see.
[46:05.390 --> 46:06.030]  Let's see.
[46:06.750 --> 46:07.610]  This is crazy.
[46:07.750 --> 46:10.270]  Thank you guys very much for joining us on a Friday.
[46:10.790 --> 46:12.710]  This is really wild.
[46:13.790 --> 46:15.850]  We got big old fat heist tomorrow.
[46:16.010 --> 46:17.330]  And the day after that,
[46:17.790 --> 46:20.430]  I think we got some little special bonus video.
[46:21.090 --> 46:24.010]  All right, just drive footage and get out.
[46:26.110 --> 46:26.510]  Uh...
[46:26.970 --> 46:29.250]  Enter through the wine cellar, grab the key,
[46:29.330 --> 46:30.490]  then upstairs to the party.
[46:31.390 --> 46:32.670]  Gimlet smells a cat.
[46:33.150 --> 46:35.290]  Please be careful not to step on any tails.
[46:36.050 --> 46:37.010]  Cosmo and Gimlet.
[46:37.030 --> 46:39.190]  Swapping people out, is this not a six player game?
[46:41.970 --> 46:43.430]  Dude, I don't have enough of these.
[46:43.530 --> 46:43.830]  Come on.
[46:44.730 --> 46:45.370]  All right.
[46:45.790 --> 46:46.750]  I'm locked in.
[46:47.430 --> 46:47.710]  Oh, whoops.
[46:47.790 --> 46:48.050]  Sorry.
[46:49.130 --> 46:51.410]  Unless you want to be the beat them up person, Gavin.
[46:52.390 --> 46:53.010]  No, it's all right.
[46:53.010 --> 46:54.110]  You were doing pretty good at that.
[46:54.250 --> 46:55.990]  Yeah, Andrew, I think you're doing pretty good
[46:55.990 --> 46:56.730]  as Wreck-It Ralph.
[47:00.030 --> 47:01.710]  Did I take your character, Gavin?
[47:02.450 --> 47:02.870]  Who?
[47:05.290 --> 47:06.690]  I don't know the name.
[47:08.230 --> 47:09.950]  Just hit B and C, what your character is.
[47:10.590 --> 47:11.010]  Sake?
[47:11.850 --> 47:12.730]  No, I was Blaine.
[47:12.910 --> 47:13.790]  I mean, Gibson.
[47:14.450 --> 47:14.870]  Blaine?
[47:16.850 --> 47:18.170]  You guys are ridiculous.
[47:18.170 --> 47:23.370]  I was Blaine.
[47:23.530 --> 47:24.110]  I mean, Gibson.
[47:24.730 --> 47:26.050]  Let's hit this early, huh?
[47:27.510 --> 47:30.530]  I'll wrench you to instantly complete any interaction
[47:30.530 --> 47:31.630]  or break windows of barrels.
[47:31.790 --> 47:31.930]  Nice.
[47:32.270 --> 47:32.870]  Take that.
[47:33.210 --> 47:34.670]  Three lives remaining, nice.
[47:37.190 --> 47:39.830]  All right, Gimlet smells cat, so everyone be careful.
[47:42.030 --> 47:43.450]  Gimlet smells the cat.
[47:44.030 --> 47:45.350]  There's a guy right here.
[47:46.390 --> 47:47.110]  Oh, there's a guy there?
[47:47.590 --> 47:48.150]  Yeah, I got him just now.
[47:48.150 --> 47:48.450]  Don't worry.
[47:48.890 --> 47:50.470]  He just got fucking Gimleted, dude.
[47:50.790 --> 47:51.470]  Don't worry about it.
[47:52.570 --> 47:53.290]  Jesus Christ.
[47:54.130 --> 47:54.690]  Double Gimlet.
[47:55.230 --> 47:55.590]  Jeez.
[47:56.490 --> 47:56.850]  Goddamn.
[47:57.570 --> 47:59.210]  I know I'm not subtle, but fucking A.
[47:59.810 --> 48:01.810]  I haven't died, well, I haven't permanently died.
[48:02.250 --> 48:03.470]  All right, okay.
[48:07.190 --> 48:08.330]  Two guys there.
[48:12.480 --> 48:12.900]  Uh-oh.
[48:13.960 --> 48:14.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[48:14.520 --> 48:14.740]  It's okay.
[48:15.060 --> 48:15.640]  He's gonna Gimlet.
[48:15.880 --> 48:16.640]  We got it, we got it.
[48:16.840 --> 48:17.100]  We're good.
[48:17.100 --> 48:17.440]  Okay.
[48:18.960 --> 48:20.460]  Oh, this is a little kitty.
[48:20.800 --> 48:21.220]  That's cats, be careful.
[48:21.360 --> 48:21.800]  Yeah, be careful.
[48:21.860 --> 48:22.480]  Don't touch the cat.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.140]  Can I touch it with my blind?
[48:24.240 --> 48:24.880]  No, no, no.
[48:24.960 --> 48:26.000]  Don't touch the cat at all.
[48:26.200 --> 48:26.440]  Okay.
[48:27.200 --> 48:28.840]  Oh, well, Andrew has engaged.
[48:29.180 --> 48:29.680]  Oh, Andrew.
[48:29.680 --> 48:30.280]  That's my job.
[48:31.120 --> 48:31.920]  I engage with people.
[48:35.200 --> 48:35.920]  Missed it.
[48:36.320 --> 48:38.160]  I give them a concussion so they don't remember
[48:38.160 --> 48:38.760]  when they wake up.
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.960]  We got, uh, I just paid money for a money door.
[48:43.380 --> 48:46.300]  There's a bow, there's a crossbow, coffee.
[48:46.700 --> 48:47.480]  Oh, shit.
[48:47.480 --> 48:50.100]  Grenades and health.
[48:50.680 --> 48:53.320]  I'm down on the, I don't, ground floor.
[48:53.580 --> 48:54.440]  Is that what it's called, Gavin?
[48:55.160 --> 48:55.880]  Oh, big time.
[48:56.100 --> 48:56.500]  Oh, right.
[48:59.280 --> 49:00.740]  Need a yellow key up here.
[49:01.000 --> 49:01.360]  Oh, shit.
[49:04.020 --> 49:05.580]  Didn't win the next heist finale.
[49:05.840 --> 49:07.940]  Could you eat a normal meal now?
[49:08.280 --> 49:08.700]  Oh, no.
[49:09.280 --> 49:10.820]  Do you think you could eat a fist of ham?
[49:12.880 --> 49:13.600]  Great question.
[49:14.140 --> 49:15.240]  I got a disguise.
[49:15.720 --> 49:16.420]  Fist of ham?
[49:16.420 --> 49:17.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[49:17.880 --> 49:18.620]  Like my fist?
[49:18.740 --> 49:21.020]  Like it looks exactly like your fist, but it's ham.
[49:21.860 --> 49:22.260]  Yeah.
[49:22.480 --> 49:23.100]  That's a lot of ham.
[49:23.500 --> 49:24.160]  Hammer fist?
[49:25.900 --> 49:26.700]  Ham fisted.
[49:27.140 --> 49:27.940]  You were ham fisting.
[49:28.160 --> 49:28.340]  Oh.
[49:30.880 --> 49:31.480]  Lights out.
[49:34.320 --> 49:35.360]  The lights are already out.
[49:36.520 --> 49:39.500]  Finding a lot of places that need specific keys.
[49:40.460 --> 49:41.660]  Yeah, ham fisted is an insult,
[49:41.820 --> 49:43.280]  but you know, it sounds kind of good.
[49:43.560 --> 49:44.320]  What does it mean?
[49:44.820 --> 49:46.160]  Just like sloppy job?
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.060]  Like, yeah, yeah.
[49:47.640 --> 49:49.720]  Stumbly and poorly done and all that.
[49:50.220 --> 49:50.900]  Stumbly bumbly?
[49:52.240 --> 49:52.720]  Like...
[49:53.700 --> 49:54.180]  Yeah.
[49:55.080 --> 49:55.740]  No finesse.
[49:57.680 --> 49:59.760]  Like you trying to get through that sentence just now?
[49:59.800 --> 49:59.900]  Yeah.
[50:00.040 --> 50:00.320]  Yeah.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.280]  Like me playing this game.
[50:04.880 --> 50:07.980]  After 4 p.m. on a Friday, the words are difficult.
[50:09.120 --> 50:09.640]  Something like that.
[50:11.540 --> 50:12.700]  Don't got them all anymore.
[50:14.580 --> 50:16.280]  Don't got them all anymore.
[50:16.480 --> 50:17.680]  They come back Monday morning.
[50:19.340 --> 50:21.140]  What do you do on the weekend?
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.120]  Just sit quietly.
[50:24.300 --> 50:25.540]  I just deafen.
[50:26.100 --> 50:26.340]  Yeah.
[50:29.120 --> 50:32.980]  Let's get another disguise.
[50:34.080 --> 50:35.440]  Oh, through the vents.
[50:36.120 --> 50:36.820]  Ooh, and there's a key.
[50:37.400 --> 50:37.960]  Missing?
[50:38.020 --> 50:39.760]  Yellow keys needed everywhere, huh?
[50:40.700 --> 50:41.820]  Mm-hmm.
[50:41.880 --> 50:42.200]  Damn.
[50:42.300 --> 50:42.640]  I just got one.
[50:42.640 --> 50:43.980]  Did you?
[50:44.500 --> 50:44.600]  Yep.
[50:45.940 --> 50:46.700]  Beep, boop, boop.
[50:47.540 --> 50:48.760]  Ooh, should I do a bit of hacking?
[50:48.920 --> 50:49.300]  Just take me now.
[50:50.740 --> 50:51.800]  Bit of hack-shua.
[50:52.140 --> 50:52.680]  Don't see you.
[50:52.680 --> 50:53.700]  There's a lot of guys over here.
[50:56.040 --> 50:57.520]  Got a little lights out here on the boys.
[50:58.080 --> 50:58.420]  Ground floor.
[50:58.580 --> 50:59.520]  Hey, floor clear.
[50:59.680 --> 51:00.160]  Ground floor.
[51:00.280 --> 51:00.680]  Way to go.
[51:01.200 --> 51:01.520]  Shit.
[51:04.100 --> 51:04.420]  Huh.
[51:06.880 --> 51:07.600]  Nick, how was your-
[51:07.600 --> 51:09.320]  Let's see what they call the next floor.
[51:09.480 --> 51:10.040]  So, go on.
[51:10.100 --> 51:11.200]  How was your hot dog yesterday?
[51:11.640 --> 51:12.440]  Or today, or whatever that was.
[51:12.440 --> 51:13.060]  Oh, it was delicious.
[51:13.380 --> 51:13.580]  What'd you have?
[51:13.780 --> 51:15.340]  It was a Costco dog.
[51:15.760 --> 51:16.360]  Oh, nice.
[51:16.960 --> 51:17.980]  You went to the Costco.
[51:19.320 --> 51:19.680]  Yeah.
[51:20.900 --> 51:21.680]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[51:21.720 --> 51:23.880]  If we go down here, there's a place to use the key.
[51:24.600 --> 51:24.800]  Okay.
[51:24.940 --> 51:26.400]  The boy loves Costco pizza.
[51:26.400 --> 51:26.920]  Right down here?
[51:28.940 --> 51:29.720]  Down all the way?
[51:29.920 --> 51:30.280]  Yep.
[51:30.660 --> 51:31.040]  That's good.
[51:31.220 --> 51:32.180]  What am I doing out here?
[51:32.280 --> 51:32.460]  Oh, shit.
[51:32.460 --> 51:32.740]  Right there.
[51:33.240 --> 51:33.440]  Yep.
[51:35.820 --> 51:38.400]  Just be careful, you're gonna get a-
[51:38.400 --> 51:39.500]  Yeah, tons of lasers.
[51:40.060 --> 51:40.360]  Tons.
[51:42.440 --> 51:44.400]  I'll see if I can disable any, but I don't think I can.
[51:49.400 --> 51:50.940]  Why is it always gotta be sweet relish?
[51:50.940 --> 51:51.500]  God damn it.
[51:52.280 --> 51:53.460]  Little too far, sorry.
[51:53.920 --> 51:54.260]  That's okay.
[51:56.100 --> 51:57.260]  Electricity on this also.
[51:58.140 --> 51:58.560]  Got it.
[51:58.600 --> 52:00.040]  Why do places always carry sweet relish?
[52:02.300 --> 52:04.000]  I don't like any relish, so it's all the same.
[52:04.000 --> 52:04.720]  It's an old relish.
[52:05.100 --> 52:05.220]  Really?
[52:06.420 --> 52:06.500]  No.
[52:06.960 --> 52:07.140]  Dill?
[52:07.520 --> 52:08.380]  Like a dill relish?
[52:10.140 --> 52:11.200]  Can I get another key?
[52:11.920 --> 52:13.080]  I'm not really a dill guy.
[52:14.720 --> 52:15.160]  Really?
[52:16.040 --> 52:16.620]  You like pickles?
[52:17.140 --> 52:19.180]  Jesus, Eli Bench!
[52:20.960 --> 52:21.840]  Another 50?
[52:22.020 --> 52:22.920]  What the fuck?
[52:23.340 --> 52:23.840]  What is happening?
[52:23.840 --> 52:25.860]  What's that, like 250 or something?
[52:26.040 --> 52:27.400]  Thank you so much, Eli Bench.
[52:27.660 --> 52:27.740]  Wild.
[52:28.260 --> 52:28.600]  What?
[52:29.260 --> 52:29.400]  What?
[52:29.400 --> 52:31.220]  You're the craziest person in the world!
[52:33.200 --> 52:34.080]  Jesus Christ.
[52:34.960 --> 52:35.880]  Yeah, you're nuts, bro.
[52:36.620 --> 52:36.900]  Oh my god.
[52:36.900 --> 52:37.360]  In this economy?
[52:37.400 --> 52:38.640]  Thank you so much, Eli.
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.980]  Yeah, this is crazy.
[52:41.060 --> 52:42.060]  Wow, thank you.
[52:42.060 --> 52:43.640]  Stream's dedicated to Eli.
[52:44.120 --> 52:45.020]  Yeah, no kidding.
[52:47.320 --> 52:48.400]  Gavin, you don't like pickles?
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.000]  Nah.
[52:52.920 --> 52:53.660]  And I do.
[52:53.740 --> 52:55.120]  I know Eric's not a pickle guy.
[52:55.220 --> 52:57.940]  I think if the world never figured it out,
[52:58.700 --> 53:00.580]  I don't think it'd be much worse.
[53:01.060 --> 53:02.060]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[53:04.820 --> 53:05.680]  Lights out.
[53:08.500 --> 53:09.340]  Lights out.
[53:12.440 --> 53:12.840]  Ooh.
[53:14.260 --> 53:15.360]  You like how I play?
[53:16.960 --> 53:17.740]  You're crazy.
[53:21.500 --> 53:23.360]  I find it interesting, since you're the,
[53:23.660 --> 53:27.040]  you know, you're like a pickled Branson or whatever.
[53:27.940 --> 53:28.240]  Oh, Branson.
[53:28.240 --> 53:29.320]  We went over this on the podcast.
[53:29.920 --> 53:30.260]  Or whatever.
[53:30.260 --> 53:31.260]  I know, I know, I know.
[53:33.840 --> 53:35.060]  I know, I know.
[53:36.160 --> 53:37.160]  Guys, Nick knows.
[53:37.460 --> 53:38.440]  Don't question him.
[53:38.660 --> 53:39.580]  He's got it, he knows.
[53:40.460 --> 53:40.840]  I know.
[53:41.100 --> 53:41.560]  He knows.
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.540]  You can tell by the pitch in his voice
[53:45.540 --> 53:47.060]  and how many times he says it that he knows.
[53:47.360 --> 53:48.520]  I got it.
[53:49.460 --> 53:51.120]  Dude, where are we going, Andrew?
[53:51.300 --> 53:52.140]  I don't know, I'm about to go down.
[53:52.220 --> 53:52.660]  Where the hell am I?
[53:53.300 --> 53:53.880]  Oh, there you are.
[53:54.200 --> 53:54.420]  Yeah.
[53:58.620 --> 53:59.340]  Jesus Christ.
[54:00.700 --> 54:01.280]  Gimlet, attack.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.460]  Oh, we got a safe out here.
[54:04.240 --> 54:05.020]  Nice, good work.
[54:05.620 --> 54:06.660]  Oh, I didn't even see that.
[54:08.740 --> 54:09.100]  Nice.
[54:10.340 --> 54:10.980]  Oh, shit.
[54:11.760 --> 54:12.480]  Oh, Andrew.
[54:12.480 --> 54:14.180]  I shot the shit out of you.
[54:14.660 --> 54:15.780]  Oh, no, he's got a gun.
[54:16.720 --> 54:17.740]  Shooting the dog?
[54:18.240 --> 54:19.380]  He tried to shoot the dog.
[54:19.500 --> 54:20.240]  No one shoot Gimlet.
[54:20.800 --> 54:21.620]  Everyone be nice to Gimlet.
[54:21.800 --> 54:22.700]  There's health in here, Andrew.
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.060]  Okay.
[54:23.240 --> 54:24.180]  No, don't shoot Gimlet.
[54:24.960 --> 54:25.160]  Okay.
[54:25.960 --> 54:26.940]  Pick up the revival.
[54:27.100 --> 54:27.520]  Because of the death.
[54:28.420 --> 54:29.320]  Because on account of the death.
[54:29.320 --> 54:29.540]  We need a key.
[54:30.760 --> 54:31.440]  Who has one?
[54:33.140 --> 54:33.860]  Not me.
[54:34.200 --> 54:35.380]  Oh my God, Andrew, you're crazy.
[54:36.240 --> 54:37.320]  We got to go this way.
[54:38.320 --> 54:39.920]  Oh, it seems to be on the ground somewhere.
[54:41.240 --> 54:41.320]  What?
[54:42.800 --> 54:44.040]  I think it's in the grounds.
[54:45.120 --> 54:45.420]  Oh, okay.
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.540]  Check out the grounds.
[54:47.700 --> 54:48.500]  Oh, Christ.
[54:50.600 --> 54:51.660]  Based on all the coins,
[54:51.740 --> 54:52.900]  I don't think anyone's been this way.
[54:53.380 --> 54:53.900]  No, I don't think so.
[54:54.160 --> 54:54.800]  Did you?
[54:55.400 --> 54:56.100]  Good job, Nick.
[54:56.100 --> 54:57.320]  Yeah, but I'm being pursued.
[54:57.960 --> 54:58.760]  And I'm trying to get to you.
[54:59.300 --> 55:00.580]  Andrew, activate fists.
[55:01.320 --> 55:02.140]  I'm gonna listen.
[55:03.080 --> 55:03.740]  Oh, gunman.
[55:04.400 --> 55:05.120]  This way, Nick.
[55:05.780 --> 55:06.220]  Yep.
[55:09.450 --> 55:09.890]  Ow.
[55:10.770 --> 55:11.550]  Just keep running.
[55:12.650 --> 55:13.630]  Ow, you little mother.
[55:14.910 --> 55:15.730]  I got him up here.
[55:15.950 --> 55:16.430]  I got him.
[55:16.530 --> 55:17.070]  Go, go, go.
[55:17.130 --> 55:18.170]  Oh, I'm with...
[55:18.690 --> 55:19.490]  We're all up here.
[55:19.950 --> 55:20.410]  Hey, what's up?
[55:20.650 --> 55:21.150]  Oh, we're going up?
[55:21.290 --> 55:21.990]  It's me and Gimlet.
[55:22.670 --> 55:22.890]  Okay.
[55:22.970 --> 55:24.090]  You just gotta go somewhere, Nick,
[55:24.130 --> 55:26.090]  that isn't in the room with all six of them.
[55:26.230 --> 55:26.570]  Okay, okay.
[55:26.610 --> 55:29.090]  Yeah, yeah, but what if he keeps hanging out
[55:29.090 --> 55:29.950]  in the room with all six of them?
[55:30.110 --> 55:30.490]  Now what?
[55:33.010 --> 55:34.470]  Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[55:35.510 --> 55:36.470]  Still thinking about hot dogs.
[55:37.390 --> 55:37.950]  Jesus Christ.
[55:41.010 --> 55:41.750]  Shit, shit, shit.
[55:41.790 --> 55:42.930]  There you go, you did it.
[55:44.470 --> 55:44.790]  Yeah.
[55:44.950 --> 55:45.830]  Hey, what's up?
[55:46.110 --> 55:47.370]  In the room with all six of them.
[55:47.610 --> 55:47.850]  What's up?
[55:48.070 --> 55:49.130]  Have you been standing here this whole time?
[55:49.270 --> 55:49.390]  Yes.
[55:49.630 --> 55:49.790]  Oh my God.
[55:50.250 --> 55:51.230]  Oh God, run.
[55:51.490 --> 55:52.050]  Oh shit.
[55:54.050 --> 55:54.670]  Smoke out.
[55:55.170 --> 55:55.790]  Oh God.
[55:55.970 --> 55:56.750]  We got him, we got him, we got him.
[55:56.790 --> 55:57.030]  We're good.
[55:57.370 --> 55:57.790]  We're all right.
[55:58.770 --> 55:59.390]  Ah, woman.
[56:02.370 --> 56:04.150]  It's not the first time he said that, but all right.
[56:05.570 --> 56:05.970]  Get him, Gimlet.
[56:06.070 --> 56:06.970]  I want that health real bad.
[56:07.410 --> 56:08.410]  That's not health, that's a life.
[56:09.690 --> 56:10.010]  Fuck.
[56:10.550 --> 56:11.010]  Told you.
[56:11.070 --> 56:11.850]  Oh damn.
[56:11.850 --> 56:12.350]  You just keep doing it.
[56:12.350 --> 56:13.730]  Yep, I was committed.
[56:14.790 --> 56:15.970]  Andrew's bleeding from the neck.
[56:18.910 --> 56:19.670]  Oh shit.
[56:21.850 --> 56:22.810]  Here we go.
[56:24.010 --> 56:24.510]  Hang on.
[56:25.870 --> 56:27.810]  I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[56:28.150 --> 56:28.650]  All right, go.
[56:29.690 --> 56:30.410]  Run, run.
[56:31.490 --> 56:32.430]  Ah, I'm gonna get some arrows.
[56:32.430 --> 56:33.370]  Everyone move, everyone move.
[56:33.790 --> 56:35.690]  Everybody stay away from me, I'm shooting blood everywhere.
[56:36.050 --> 56:37.190]  Unless you want blood on your clothes.
[56:38.190 --> 56:38.950]  I'm spritzing.
[56:40.110 --> 56:40.370]  Uh-oh.
[56:40.550 --> 56:41.270]  Good job, Gimlet.
[56:44.430 --> 56:46.270]  That's health, that's definitely health.
[56:46.410 --> 56:47.390]  That has to be health.
[56:47.530 --> 56:48.210]  Get it, get it.
[56:48.650 --> 56:49.530]  You're getting punched in the back.
[56:49.530 --> 56:50.230]  Got it, got it.
[56:50.410 --> 56:51.150]  I'm charged up.
[56:51.510 --> 56:52.890]  Ow, Andrew, help this man.
[56:53.050 --> 56:54.250]  Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[56:54.550 --> 56:55.230]  I'm on my way.
[56:56.890 --> 56:57.550]  Andrew, help.
[56:57.730 --> 56:58.250]  I'm gonna die.
[56:58.270 --> 56:58.550]  I'm coming.
[56:58.810 --> 56:59.530]  I'm gonna go down.
[56:59.910 --> 57:00.770]  He's faster than me.
[57:00.770 --> 57:01.750]  You're running away from me.
[57:01.990 --> 57:02.430]  Well, I mean.
[57:02.790 --> 57:03.150]  Ow.
[57:03.290 --> 57:03.970]  Andrew, help.
[57:04.170 --> 57:04.530]  Please.
[57:04.990 --> 57:06.050]  I stepped on the cat.
[57:06.170 --> 57:06.670]  Oh shit.
[57:07.150 --> 57:08.430]  You guys suck.
[57:09.070 --> 57:09.750]  We gotta go.
[57:10.890 --> 57:11.790]  Oh, they're everywhere.
[57:12.710 --> 57:13.350]  Holy God.
[57:14.290 --> 57:14.610]  Spiders.
[57:16.630 --> 57:18.110]  Activate the spides.
[57:19.830 --> 57:20.570]  I'm bleeding out.
[57:20.870 --> 57:21.130]  Gold.
[57:21.290 --> 57:21.750]  I went down.
[57:22.870 --> 57:24.070]  Ah, I fell out.
[57:24.110 --> 57:26.750]  I'm in the room that you guys were just in, I just died.
[57:26.970 --> 57:28.370]  Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[57:28.590 --> 57:29.990]  I'm right next to where Nick is.
[57:30.950 --> 57:33.150]  Yeah, yeah, keep going down that way.
[57:33.350 --> 57:34.630]  Yeah, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[57:34.690 --> 57:35.630]  I'm just on the other side of that door.
[57:36.230 --> 57:37.370]  But be careful, there's a bunch of guys.
[57:38.070 --> 57:39.410]  Here, you hold him off, I'll get him.
[57:42.500 --> 57:43.040]  The gold.
[57:43.320 --> 57:43.760]  Thank you.
[57:46.420 --> 57:46.920]  All right, let's go.
[57:47.220 --> 57:47.480]  Uh oh.
[57:47.640 --> 57:49.740]  God, this thing just keeps locking, Jesus Christ.
[57:49.760 --> 57:50.300]  Yeah, I know.
[57:50.680 --> 57:51.340]  Real son of a bitch.
[57:51.360 --> 57:52.020]  Oh, you know what, Eric?
[57:52.120 --> 57:53.680]  For fast access, I broke the window.
[57:54.120 --> 57:54.440]  What?
[57:55.540 --> 57:56.120]  Just now.
[57:56.440 --> 57:56.600]  Nick.
[57:58.500 --> 57:59.200]  For a quick exit.
[57:59.720 --> 58:00.840]  Andrew, that was crazy.
[58:01.820 --> 58:02.200]  We got it.
[58:03.560 --> 58:04.140]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[58:04.180 --> 58:04.660]  Oh shit.
[58:04.900 --> 58:05.260]  It's fine.
[58:05.280 --> 58:05.980]  Oh shit.
[58:08.600 --> 58:09.900]  I'm on the brink of death.
[58:11.200 --> 58:13.120]  It says we're supposed to go down this way.
[58:14.040 --> 58:14.680]  Oh shit.
[58:14.720 --> 58:15.680]  If you go down, I got you.
[58:16.060 --> 58:17.340]  Can we break this window right here, Nick?
[58:17.460 --> 58:18.140]  Okay, nevermind.
[58:19.000 --> 58:20.480]  I don't have any more.
[58:20.600 --> 58:22.320]  Oh, I thought it was like your magic power or whatever.
[58:22.640 --> 58:22.860]  Shit.
[58:23.060 --> 58:23.520]  No, no, no.
[58:23.800 --> 58:24.560]  Gavin's down here.
[58:24.660 --> 58:26.040]  I got you, I got you, Gavin, I got you.
[58:26.660 --> 58:27.560]  I said blarg.
[58:27.980 --> 58:28.500]  Oh, there he is.
[58:28.600 --> 58:28.900]  Pfft.
[58:30.020 --> 58:31.380]  I thought you were just calling red versus blue.
[58:32.100 --> 58:34.020]  I saw Boston blarg.
[58:34.860 --> 58:35.180]  Oh!
[58:38.240 --> 58:39.980]  Hey, opening a door with the gold key.
[58:41.340 --> 58:41.780]  Good.
[58:43.480 --> 58:44.600]  Oh, it's a woman?
[58:44.900 --> 58:45.820]  Ow, you little son of a bitch.
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  No, no, no, Gimlet's got her.
[58:47.060 --> 58:48.080]  The woman loves Gimlet.
[58:48.980 --> 58:50.820]  Everyone loves fucking Gimlet, bro.
[58:51.140 --> 58:52.380]  Behind you, behind you, Andrew.
[58:52.920 --> 58:53.840]  Gimlet, go, get him.
[58:53.880 --> 58:54.920]  Andrew the Fitbot.
[58:55.440 --> 58:55.860]  Got him.
[58:58.320 --> 58:59.320]  Let's keep going.
[59:00.020 --> 59:00.920]  Keep going where?
[59:01.320 --> 59:02.260]  I don't know.
[59:02.620 --> 59:04.340]  I'm talking mainly to Nick.
[59:05.520 --> 59:06.180]  Wait, wait, wait.
[59:06.180 --> 59:07.660]  We just gotta keep going.
[59:08.120 --> 59:08.260]  Ah!
[59:08.260 --> 59:08.340]  Ah!
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.240]  I'm real lost now.
[59:11.720 --> 59:13.060]  Yeah, I don't know where we're supposed to go.
[59:14.620 --> 59:15.680]  Oh, it's in there, Nick.
[59:15.740 --> 59:16.920]  We passed what we needed.
[59:17.780 --> 59:18.140]  Okay.
[59:20.500 --> 59:21.260]  It's over here.
[59:21.740 --> 59:23.060]  I'm getting it, I'm getting it.
[59:23.260 --> 59:24.360]  Oh, they're shooting me, Nick.
[59:24.360 --> 59:25.960]  Oh my God, you're getting shot, dude.
[59:26.440 --> 59:27.640]  Oh, I hit the alarm.
[59:27.900 --> 59:28.220]  Argh!
[59:28.500 --> 59:29.440]  I'm about to die, I died.
[59:30.320 --> 59:31.740]  Focus on Nick, focus on Nick.
[59:32.360 --> 59:34.340]  Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.
[59:34.360 --> 59:34.980]  You fucks.
[59:35.000 --> 59:35.380]  Don't touch me.
[59:36.260 --> 59:37.040]  Oh, no, the door.
[59:37.040 --> 59:38.460]  They locked it again.
[59:39.560 --> 59:40.000]  Fuck!
[59:41.600 --> 59:43.240]  Oh, I almost said 5-0-1, but it's just five.
[59:43.720 --> 59:44.220]  I'm down.
[59:45.980 --> 59:47.000]  I'm also down.
[59:47.400 --> 59:48.740]  Five lives remaining, baby.
[59:48.820 --> 59:49.460]  Let's respawn.
[59:50.280 --> 59:50.980]  Yeah, respawning.
[59:52.080 --> 59:53.240]  Well, I could've got you up.
[59:55.260 --> 59:55.980]  I didn't say anything.
[59:56.060 --> 59:57.080]  Who are you talking to?
[59:57.120 --> 59:58.200]  Your fucking self?
[59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.360]  Someone, what, you down?
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.420]  We were all down, you moron!
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.600]  I was coming to get you, then you said,
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.080]  You weren't saying shit!
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:09.520]  What?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.400]  5-0-1!
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.560]  5-0-1!
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.140]  Are you brain dead?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.080]  What are you talking about?
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.660]  I got you, I got the thing.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740]  We gotta go, we gotta run.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.020]  If you went down and I was running towards you,
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.000]  I couldn't have helped you up.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.400]  That would've been great a couple minutes ago,
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.500]  if you would've called it out and done it.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.040]  Well, I was surprised you just got up.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.620]  I was coming.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:30.900]  What do you want from me?
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.720]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.600]  Everyone's getting out of here!
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.700]  For you to fucking say anything about it?
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.540]  We gotta go!
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.820]  You could've said something!
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.180]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.400]  If you're gonna help someone, say something.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.040]  Back to the van!
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:43.760]  You didn't say shit!
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:44.900]  I think I said...
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.200]  I didn't hear anything.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:46.340]  I think I said...
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.940]  What do you think you said?
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:48.440]  I said, what?
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.780]  What do you think you said?
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:50.760]  Blarg.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.980]  I said, blarg, I'm on the way.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.240]  You did not say the second part.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.260]  We did it!
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.040]  Maybe.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.700]  Insane, insane.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.480]  5-0-1 couldn't have come fast enough.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.580]  Where's this?
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.260]  One sec.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.200]  Okay, cool.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:08.420]  I got the thing.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.080]  Oh, my God.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:10.580]  Yes!
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:11.680]  Achievement!
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.320]  We were even close, 192 of 317.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.600]  Wow!
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.720]  Well, we lost a lot on our corpses.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.420]  Goddamn, boys.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.400]  Rough train.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.020]  Gavin was allegedly coming through.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.720]  But 5-0-1, we did it.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.660]  This has been Monaco 2.

[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.840]  Going crazy mode.
