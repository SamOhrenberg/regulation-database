[00:00.000 --> 00:04.560]  I feel so crazy right now. I'm having a cup of coffee, and it's not- oh my god.
[00:04.560 --> 00:06.060]  How would you refer to a group of crows?
[00:06.060 --> 00:06.980]  That's a murder.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.120]  Oh, yeah, that's a murder.
[00:08.900 --> 00:10.980]  I just text my wife to make another pot of coffee.
[00:12.360 --> 00:15.140]  Gavin, this is like breakneck speed, right? Like, this is crazy?

[00:20.000 --> 00:20.480]  It's an egg!
[00:21.440 --> 00:22.800]  The Black Sea, I know that.
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.760]  What is going on?
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.020]  No!
[00:26.220 --> 00:27.140]  What do you mean, though?
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.160]  I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Andrew!
[00:29.160 --> 00:31.000]  Oh, I know that!
[00:31.580 --> 00:32.300]  I know that!
[00:32.320 --> 00:34.180]  It's absolutely the same record!
[00:35.140 --> 00:37.200]  Why would-
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.820]  Don't try again! Stop! Hang on!
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.880]  Let's look at the achievements for a second.
