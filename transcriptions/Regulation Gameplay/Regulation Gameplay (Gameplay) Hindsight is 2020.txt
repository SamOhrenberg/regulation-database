[00:00.000 --> 00:08.180]  So our decision to have a mat of TNT under the logo in Achievement City was maybe one of the
[00:08.180 --> 00:13.040]  worst decisions we could ever have come up with. It really fucked the world up. It was like extra
[00:13.040 --> 00:18.160]  laggy over here and if lightning struck it sometimes it would go off and if there was a
[00:18.160 --> 00:24.200]  fire that spread it would go off. It really ruined our playground. This bridge used to give me fits.
[00:24.200 --> 00:31.140]  I never felt comfortable with how we made it and tried to get it nice. I don't know why I ever cared
[00:31.140 --> 00:38.140]  or why it mattered. Oh, the butts just dropped. Did you see that? I just saw the butts drop.
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.340]  Oh my god, butts dropped on its own? Yeah.
