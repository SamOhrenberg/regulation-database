[00:00.000 --> 00:01.560]  Is this the main? Where's the main menu?
[00:01.680 --> 00:04.420]  This doesn't this looks like a shit main menu screen, doesn't it?
[00:04.740 --> 00:07.760]  Yeah, at some point, I would say in the early 2000s,
[00:07.820 --> 00:09.560]  everyone forgot how to make a menu.
[00:10.080 --> 00:10.940]  Here's what I want.
[00:11.800 --> 00:14.380]  A vertical list of text.
[00:15.080 --> 00:16.780]  I just want a cool screen to look at.
[00:17.160 --> 00:19.600]  Just give me an ambient image. Give me a screensaver.
[00:19.800 --> 00:22.420]  People may have forgot how to do menu screens,
[00:22.540 --> 00:25.720]  but what we didn't forget is how to make regulation gameplays.
[00:26.100 --> 00:27.380]  Did you call it Gregulation?
[00:28.140 --> 00:29.560]  No, I think I said regulation.
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.760]  I don't think I said regulation, but maybe I did.
[00:32.100 --> 00:34.840]  Because Gregulation is like the new version of Gregging it, I think.
[00:35.740 --> 00:36.840]  Gregulation and finance.
[00:38.060 --> 00:42.420]  We are in Hitman 3 because there is a new elusive target.
[00:43.340 --> 00:46.260]  The one, the only, Conor McGregor, which
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.220]  I don't know how much you know about current day
[00:49.220 --> 00:52.440]  Conor McGregor feels like very unfortunate timing.
[00:52.720 --> 00:53.580]  Oh, what's he been up to?
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.900]  He was supposed to fight for the first time in a long time.
[00:56.900 --> 00:59.820]  I think like the the week that this came out,
[00:59.900 --> 01:03.500]  but he pulled out of the fight because he broke his baby toe
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.460]  and has gotten a lot of criticism for it.
[01:06.540 --> 01:07.960]  Well, you know, it's a long career.
[01:08.220 --> 01:11.540]  There's a lot of a lot of pressure on the baby toe during a fight.
[01:11.980 --> 01:13.160]  There is. Yeah.
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.100]  But he but he somebody in his past pulled out because they broke their foot
[01:19.100 --> 01:20.680]  and he mocked him for it.
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.520]  So now he's getting heavily mocked for pulling out with a broken toe.
[01:24.700 --> 01:26.780]  It's all fun and games until the owie is on your foot.
[01:26.900 --> 01:31.360]  It is. Mr. Quinn has lately become obsessed with killer shirtless man.
[01:31.860 --> 01:34.200]  No, I think this is a billionaire guy.
[01:34.380 --> 01:37.440]  I think they're doing the Mark Zuckerberg thing.
[01:37.880 --> 01:40.420]  OK, so you don't have to kill him or you do.
[01:41.180 --> 01:43.560]  I don't think you have to.
[01:44.160 --> 01:46.580]  Some stakeholders have seen this as an opportunity
[01:46.580 --> 01:49.480]  to engage in a hostile takeover of quantum leap.
[01:49.560 --> 01:54.100]  Now what I'm interested to try to figure out is if this is Conor McGregor's
[01:54.100 --> 01:58.100]  real voice, because he talks in the trailer
[01:59.220 --> 02:03.620]  and it's so it's so bad, like it's not bad.
[02:03.940 --> 02:04.860]  How do I say this?
[02:04.940 --> 02:07.660]  If you're trying to do Conor McGregor's voice, it's bad.
[02:07.980 --> 02:12.060]  But I can't tell if it's somebody else just trying to be Irish guy
[02:12.660 --> 02:15.640]  or if it is Conor McGregor trying way too hard
[02:16.140 --> 02:18.560]  and it just coming across as disingenuous.
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.200]  What's all that?
[02:19.220 --> 02:22.060]  What's that NBA game where they had all the real players do the voices?
[02:22.800 --> 02:25.080]  The NBA game where they had players do the voices?
[02:25.540 --> 02:28.000]  Yeah, like the dog shit voice acting.
[02:28.120 --> 02:28.660]  Have you seen that?
[02:29.880 --> 02:32.260]  No. Is that like NBA jam or something like that?
[02:32.400 --> 02:34.000]  I don't know. Some basketball game.
[02:34.540 --> 02:37.820]  So for those who don't know, the thing with an elusive target is you have one run
[02:37.820 --> 02:41.040]  to do it and whatever the run is, that's that's what you got.
[02:41.300 --> 02:42.440]  That's what you got to live with.
[02:42.980 --> 02:46.080]  And I hope your run is longer than five minutes and 30 seconds,
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.000]  because that's how long it's going to take me to finish downloading this game.
[02:49.500 --> 02:51.480]  Oh, it's going to it's going to take me a while.
[02:52.060 --> 02:57.660]  I'll be slow. I really like the idea of this level,
[02:58.220 --> 03:00.500]  but don't super love the level itself.
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.280]  Yeah, I was never a fan of this one.
[03:02.720 --> 03:05.640]  I feel like too much of it was non-public.
[03:07.660 --> 03:09.140]  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[03:09.640 --> 03:12.960]  I like the levels where sort of anyone can go anywhere a lot of the time.
[03:14.440 --> 03:16.880]  This contract is elusive target when playing an elusive target.
[03:17.000 --> 03:17.660]  The following rules apply.
[03:18.120 --> 03:20.360]  You must begin the contract before the countdown expires.
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.260]  If you die, you may not retry the contract.
[03:22.380 --> 03:25.220]  Once you have completed the contract and successfully exited,
[03:25.740 --> 03:27.300]  you may not retry the contract.
[03:27.500 --> 03:30.880]  Once you have begun to complete objectives, you may no longer restart.
[03:31.340 --> 03:32.080]  Plan accordingly.
[03:32.560 --> 03:35.060]  You cannot save your game while playing an elusive target.
[03:35.660 --> 03:38.920]  The contract briefing may contain additional fail conditions.
[03:39.880 --> 03:42.960]  OK. Let's get briefed.
[03:44.900 --> 03:46.100]  HGH McGregor.
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.060]  So the other guy has to survive.
[03:51.220 --> 03:52.540]  Good evening, 47.
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.400]  Uh, welcome back to the Isle of Scales.
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.440]  Is that what they said?
[03:56.980 --> 03:57.860]  Yeah. Didn't you read it?
[03:58.520 --> 04:00.600]  No, it says in the top left now.
[04:00.840 --> 04:02.600]  Oh, it's all eliminate Tom.
[04:02.720 --> 04:04.920]  Oh, OK. Mr. Timothy Quinn.
[04:05.340 --> 04:08.400]  Yeah. Make sure he survives.
[04:08.740 --> 04:09.340]  It's optional.
[04:09.840 --> 04:12.080]  Yeah. Life depends on it.
[04:12.160 --> 04:13.400]  They need some narrative suspense.
[04:13.720 --> 04:14.600]  It's not going to be easy.
[04:14.860 --> 04:17.440]  So you'll need to be creative in protecting your game
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.100]  whilst dealing with your target.
[04:20.100 --> 04:20.500]  OK.
[04:23.720 --> 04:24.700]  Oh, we got to listen to this guy.
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.480]  Now, we kind of had this
[04:31.260 --> 04:36.020]  kind of recently in combat sports between Anderson Silva and Chael Sunnen,
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.280]  where they were one of the biggest UFC fights of all time.
[04:41.740 --> 04:44.700]  Anderson Silva, one of the biggest names in MMA ever.
[04:45.300 --> 04:46.240]  And they're both old now.
[04:46.300 --> 04:47.340]  They're both in their 40s.
[04:47.840 --> 04:50.420]  And they just recently had a boxing match,
[04:50.660 --> 04:52.780]  which one of them is a known wrestler.
[04:52.960 --> 04:53.900]  So it was a weird thing.
[04:54.360 --> 04:57.340]  And they did it privately in Brazil.
[04:57.980 --> 04:59.760]  Like they treated it like an event.
[04:59.840 --> 05:02.340]  But I think it was just this super rich guy
[05:03.540 --> 05:06.920]  booked the event as like their company party.
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.980]  Like you couldn't even attend.
[05:09.540 --> 05:10.920]  It wasn't they didn't sell tickets.
[05:11.320 --> 05:13.540]  They didn't show it in America legally.
[05:14.320 --> 05:17.040]  I think the coolest move would be to get the number
[05:17.040 --> 05:18.740]  one and number two boxers in the world.
[05:18.920 --> 05:22.940]  And then they just agreed to privately fight completely alone
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.560]  with no one else there.
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.300]  And only they know the result.
[05:31.130 --> 05:32.350]  Oh, it's a death match.
[05:32.610 --> 05:33.390]  It's to the death.
[05:43.590 --> 05:47.830]  Now, I don't typically do elusive targets, Gavin.
[05:47.910 --> 05:49.950]  Do I really need to like listen to these people?
[05:50.550 --> 05:53.770]  Because there's no like menu guides, right?
[05:53.850 --> 05:54.870]  Like in the standard game.
[05:56.010 --> 05:58.350]  It's usually useful to eavesdrop
[05:58.350 --> 06:00.970]  when you don't know where the person is going to be
[06:00.970 --> 06:02.810]  or whether they or when they like blend in.
[06:03.110 --> 06:06.050]  But I feel like this target is so obviously that target.
[06:07.950 --> 06:09.310]  I want to get in there.
[06:09.830 --> 06:12.850]  There's one where you have to like kill one of two twins, I think.
[06:12.890 --> 06:14.950]  But you can't figure out which one it is unless you
[06:16.170 --> 06:17.350]  stalk them for a bit.
[06:18.590 --> 06:19.590]  Oh, that's awesome.
[06:23.520 --> 06:24.360]  I'm wondering.
[06:26.060 --> 06:27.140]  Yes, can I see?
[06:28.740 --> 06:30.740]  Not yet. I don't think they get highlighted.
[06:31.080 --> 06:31.980]  Oh, really?
[06:32.420 --> 06:35.280]  But I mean, I assume he's going to be in the in there.
[06:38.500 --> 06:40.820]  Oh, it's Tim Quinn.
[06:42.160 --> 06:43.880]  He's got them Putin stats.
[06:45.660 --> 06:49.380]  Like whenever Putin would have hockey games, he'd score like 16 goals.
[06:51.080 --> 06:52.880]  Oh, he's coming down the stairs.
[06:53.100 --> 06:55.340]  That's him. That is him.
[06:59.900 --> 07:04.540]  Just instantly pops out in like seven Hitman games.
[07:04.640 --> 07:07.820]  They've never actually had an animation that involves putting and taking off
[07:07.820 --> 07:10.840]  clothes. It's always just like the Sims getting into bed.
[07:13.940 --> 07:19.600]  OK. I really want to get in there.
[07:20.700 --> 07:21.900]  I just start scuffling.
[07:22.060 --> 07:24.120]  I want to just scuffle with them.
[07:24.300 --> 07:25.960]  I wonder if you can become the ref.
[07:26.860 --> 07:29.320]  Oh, I feel like you have to be able to do that, right?
[07:31.800 --> 07:32.760]  That'd be sick.
[07:40.740 --> 07:42.500]  Could you drop something on him?
[07:49.570 --> 07:51.690]  No, it doesn't really look like it.
[07:57.770 --> 07:59.090]  Oh, that's him. That is him.
[07:59.170 --> 08:00.350]  It's just he's bad at it.
[08:05.010 --> 08:08.710]  Yeah, I want to do that.
[08:10.170 --> 08:11.210]  You want to get in the ring?
[08:11.510 --> 08:13.730]  I want to get in there. I want to scuffle with them.
[08:14.410 --> 08:15.830]  Pause a round break.
[08:18.450 --> 08:22.410]  So you need to make Tim Quinn get disabled somehow.
[08:24.190 --> 08:24.810]  Oh, shit.
[08:28.070 --> 08:30.190]  Yeah, kick his ass, Tim.
[08:30.890 --> 08:31.970]  Kick it to death.
[08:33.590 --> 08:35.450]  There's no way I'm going to be allowed up here, right?
[08:35.950 --> 08:36.790]  VIP. Yeah.
[08:39.890 --> 08:43.470]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[08:43.470 --> 08:47.110]  Uh, uh, hit the lights, turn the power off.
[08:47.250 --> 08:48.510]  Uh, how do I?
[08:50.210 --> 08:52.110]  Oh, oh, Tim's getting kicked.
[08:52.430 --> 08:54.390]  Tim, Tim, Tim.
[08:58.070 --> 09:00.750]  Uh, I think there might be a way up there over here.
[09:03.750 --> 09:05.030]  Oh, go, go, go, go, go.
[09:05.830 --> 09:08.810]  Oh, man, I also kind of just want to watch Tim get his ass kicked.
[09:09.790 --> 09:11.070]  I'm very conflicted.
[09:11.750 --> 09:12.610]  Oh, no.
[09:17.230 --> 09:19.010]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:19.010 --> 09:19.710]  Get in the bushes.
[09:26.080 --> 09:28.060]  Oh, could you just throw a coin in?
[09:29.000 --> 09:29.420]  I don't know.
[09:30.300 --> 09:31.300]  I'm just lock picking this.
[09:34.560 --> 09:44.050]  Oh. Oh, oh.
[09:46.310 --> 09:47.290]  Oh, my God.
[09:47.870 --> 09:51.230]  This is so much more intense than knowing if I fuck up and it's done.
[09:51.890 --> 09:52.930]  Yeah, I need to calm it down.
[09:54.010 --> 09:55.190]  Everybody get back in.
[09:58.290 --> 10:00.370]  Oh, Jesus, calm down.
[10:08.570 --> 10:10.410]  OK, oh, I like this.
[10:13.830 --> 10:14.590]  Can I go around?
[10:15.950 --> 10:16.750]  We've passed.
[10:17.370 --> 10:18.210]  And then you got climbing.
[10:23.490 --> 10:25.590]  That doesn't necessarily really help.
[10:26.410 --> 10:27.230]  Let's go up.
[10:32.230 --> 10:34.270]  I wonder how much time I have.
[10:37.910 --> 10:40.630]  Can lockpick, do you typically run the lockpick?
[10:40.790 --> 10:42.790]  I feel like it's so mandatory in these games.
[10:43.210 --> 10:44.530]  Oh, definitely. Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[10:45.150 --> 10:46.250]  Oh, fuck. OK.
[10:50.070 --> 10:52.470]  Oh, wow, you got away with that.
[10:53.510 --> 10:55.230]  Oh, oh, oh.
[10:55.910 --> 10:56.190]  OK.
[11:02.370 --> 11:03.490]  We've gotten messy.
[11:04.470 --> 11:05.290]  It's all right.
[11:06.030 --> 11:07.330]  Well, that's just like training room.
[11:09.690 --> 11:10.250]  That's.
[11:12.070 --> 11:14.790]  Oh, God, let's subdue this guy.
[11:16.610 --> 11:18.430]  So I want to get rid of these bodies.
[11:18.730 --> 11:19.910]  I don't want to be seen.
[11:20.230 --> 11:21.910]  I don't want anyone to discover nothing.
[11:23.290 --> 11:24.370]  I need to keep secret.
[11:24.870 --> 11:26.130]  Let's get this open.
[11:27.350 --> 11:29.870]  Let's grab his gun, pocket it.
[11:31.090 --> 11:31.750]  Oh, boy.
[11:32.710 --> 11:35.210]  Seems like you have a lot of time for until Tim dies.
[11:35.610 --> 11:41.470]  Yeah, I'm glad that we have so much of a it seems like a mockery, Tim.
[11:42.590 --> 11:44.850]  Although the music's starting to really amp up,
[11:45.010 --> 11:47.070]  which makes me feel like we're getting kind of close.
[11:50.110 --> 11:51.710]  OK, I got to run. I just got to run.
[11:53.770 --> 11:55.350]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[11:55.350 --> 11:56.710]  Let me get there, let me get there, let me get there.
[11:56.850 --> 11:58.990]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:59.210 --> 12:01.570]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[12:01.610 --> 12:02.050]  He's searching.
[12:04.090 --> 12:04.870]  Oh, you're in combat.
[12:05.390 --> 12:06.030]  Oh, no.
[12:09.990 --> 12:10.810]  Oh, shit.
[12:11.530 --> 12:12.110]  I'm in trouble.
[12:14.790 --> 12:16.650]  Seems to know exactly where you are, Scylla.
[12:25.320 --> 12:26.520]  We're back to being OK?
[12:27.900 --> 12:28.240]  No.
[12:29.060 --> 12:29.740]  Oh, fuck.
[12:29.740 --> 12:31.220]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[12:31.320 --> 12:32.980]  They're shooting at you, but it says searching.
[12:33.140 --> 12:33.920]  What's going on?
[12:34.340 --> 12:35.740]  Oh, sounds like you're in combat.
[12:37.180 --> 12:39.820]  That means the guy didn't see your outfit.
[12:39.940 --> 12:40.420]  Is that right?
[12:41.020 --> 12:41.820]  I don't know.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.860]  I don't think I've experienced getting lit up like that without being in combat.
[12:48.720 --> 12:49.440]  Oh, Tim.
[12:50.400 --> 12:52.320]  Could you just like plug him in the leg or something?
[12:53.700 --> 12:54.480]  Oh, what's the ramp?
[12:54.740 --> 12:56.060]  Look up to the left. What is that?
[12:57.460 --> 12:57.840]  What do you mean?
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.380]  You just can hit the button and the round.
[13:00.820 --> 13:02.560]  Yeah, I think that's what I was trying to get to.
[13:02.980 --> 13:03.240]  OK.
[13:04.620 --> 13:06.320]  I mean, this feels so lame.
[13:08.460 --> 13:09.860]  But I kind of fuck this.
[13:10.760 --> 13:14.760]  Well, what if you just shoot Tim, causing him to not be able to fight?
[13:16.040 --> 13:16.620]  It's a good idea.
[13:17.800 --> 13:18.380]  Shoot him in the...
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.800]  OK, well, that did not work, Gavin.
[13:28.580 --> 13:29.880]  Wait, now you have to get out.
[13:30.020 --> 13:30.680]  Tim's alive.
[13:32.480 --> 13:33.880]  I thought I killed Tim.
[13:37.360 --> 13:38.540]  You wounded him.
[13:39.560 --> 13:40.660]  Oh, shit. The eggs.
[13:40.820 --> 13:43.560]  OK, so now you have to get out or you fail.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.620]  Oh, no. Oh, we're just in combat.
[13:48.400 --> 13:49.300]  Oh, no.
[13:50.780 --> 13:52.000]  Oh, fuck. OK.
[13:53.800 --> 13:56.160]  Oh, man, this did not go in all the way.
[13:56.500 --> 14:02.040]  Oh, fuck off.
[14:03.520 --> 14:04.720]  What the fuck?
[14:04.900 --> 14:06.300]  Where did you come from?
[14:07.680 --> 14:09.510]  Oh, no.
[14:10.270 --> 14:11.350]  You got to hide or something.
[14:14.690 --> 14:16.090]  I don't trust it.
[14:18.290 --> 14:19.090]  Good get.
[14:20.570 --> 14:22.590]  OK, we're just living here for a moment.
[14:24.690 --> 14:26.230]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[14:27.250 --> 14:29.950]  This is this is this is insane.
[14:30.090 --> 14:31.090]  How are you alive?
[14:32.210 --> 14:34.490]  OK, OK, OK, we're OK.
[14:35.970 --> 14:36.910]  We're OK.
[14:37.050 --> 14:38.330]  Why are they coming up still?
[14:40.350 --> 14:41.470]  Oh, there's a...
[14:41.470 --> 14:41.590]  We're OK.
[14:42.260 --> 14:43.130]  You could get into it.
[14:43.470 --> 14:46.110]  Yeah, but I'm causing a pile on the stairs.
[14:49.430 --> 14:51.150]  Keep stacking the stairs.
[14:52.150 --> 14:52.570]  I am.
[15:02.580 --> 15:03.200]  Jesus.
[15:03.600 --> 15:03.940]  Stop.
[15:04.380 --> 15:07.860]  The good thing is you can get in some good outfits to to get into here.
[15:07.980 --> 15:09.100]  Oh, my God.
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.240]  Oh, my God.
[15:11.560 --> 15:13.440]  If you could drag one of those into the bucket.
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.100]  There's so many.
[15:18.220 --> 15:19.220]  I'm so scared.
[15:21.900 --> 15:22.740]  There's so many.
[15:24.020 --> 15:27.060]  This is, to be honest, how a lot of my elusive targets have gone.
[15:27.160 --> 15:27.960]  I think you can do it.
[15:27.980 --> 15:29.580]  I think you could drag one of the cloak.
[15:30.160 --> 15:30.600]  Oh.
[15:36.990 --> 15:37.830]  Oh, better gun.
[15:38.130 --> 15:38.590]  That's great.
[15:38.650 --> 15:40.050]  Well, that's going to be quite loud.
[15:41.870 --> 15:42.370]  Oh, shit.
[15:42.490 --> 15:43.350]  I didn't think about that.
[15:45.210 --> 15:45.970]  Oh, no.
[15:48.950 --> 15:49.610]  Fuck it.
[15:54.940 --> 15:56.980]  My score is going to be so bad.
[15:57.020 --> 15:57.920]  Look at that pile.
[15:59.440 --> 16:00.460]  That's a great pile.
[16:04.060 --> 16:05.440]  I'm going to need it.
[16:09.380 --> 16:10.260]  Oh, Jesus.
[16:13.520 --> 16:14.840]  Oh, another one.
[16:16.140 --> 16:17.640]  Why is he just hanging out?
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.000]  He doesn't care at all.
[16:19.460 --> 16:21.360]  He must be so far down he can't hear it.
[16:23.860 --> 16:25.780]  How many people are in this level?
[16:27.560 --> 16:28.680]  Yeah, I'm going for it.
[16:29.240 --> 16:30.100]  No, no, I'm not.
[16:35.120 --> 16:40.300]  That was such a good shot on the target from so far away with a pistol.
[16:40.300 --> 16:41.920]  I can't believe you got that shot.
[16:42.240 --> 16:43.200]  Oh, thank you.
[16:43.640 --> 16:47.440]  I didn't put much thought into it, which is probably why it worked.
[16:49.100 --> 16:49.900]  Can I drag?
[16:50.560 --> 16:50.900]  Yeah.
[16:52.360 --> 16:55.260]  And then I got to disguise as him and then dump him.
[16:55.820 --> 16:57.460]  You could dump him and then disguise him too.
[16:57.580 --> 16:57.940]  Oh, OK.
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.800]  I always get worried about that.
[17:01.180 --> 17:02.320]  I don't want to lose the disguise.
[17:03.540 --> 17:03.920]  All right.
[17:03.960 --> 17:06.900]  Now you should be able to stroll right out.
[17:06.900 --> 17:09.420]  Oh, yeah.
[17:14.250 --> 17:16.250]  OK, if I don't.
[17:17.290 --> 17:19.510]  Let's grab some of this weaponry
[17:20.430 --> 17:24.890]  just in case we end up all castle key that could be useful.
[17:25.570 --> 17:26.550]  Let's get this.
[17:27.010 --> 17:28.030]  Let's get that.
[17:31.030 --> 17:32.750]  Excuse me. Pardon me.
[17:34.030 --> 17:35.770]  Got to sneak through here.
[17:36.750 --> 17:38.190]  Yeah, I think we're good.
[17:40.150 --> 17:40.990]  Oh, man.
[17:41.850 --> 17:43.150]  You got shot so much.
[17:43.570 --> 17:45.130]  Oh, I took so many bullets.
[17:47.310 --> 17:50.970]  Is he just celebrating in the ring as a dead guy?
[17:53.470 --> 17:54.790]  Oh, where did he go?
[17:56.570 --> 17:58.230]  They took the body away, didn't they?
[17:58.270 --> 17:59.130]  I think they've moved the body.
[17:59.370 --> 18:01.710]  Oh, God.
[18:04.890 --> 18:06.230]  I bet you the body's over there.
[18:06.270 --> 18:07.530]  I want to find the body real quick.
[18:09.770 --> 18:12.830]  Well, this has gone the way it probably should have,
[18:12.890 --> 18:14.490]  but not at all the way I was hoping it would.
[18:15.610 --> 18:16.810]  I'm going to try and fight him.
[18:17.470 --> 18:20.690]  I want you to get in there and whoop his ass.
[18:22.230 --> 18:23.710]  I bet you I could end the round now.
[18:26.010 --> 18:26.650]  Round break.
[18:28.210 --> 18:29.030]  Do you have to be in it?
[18:29.070 --> 18:30.730]  I wonder if you have to be in a certain outfit for that.
[18:32.450 --> 18:33.250]  Fight inactive.
[18:34.270 --> 18:35.330]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[18:39.220 --> 18:40.540]  Let's get out of here.
[18:41.440 --> 18:41.840]  Ayyyy?
[18:47.400 --> 18:49.680]  This would have been a helpful path to now.
[18:50.780 --> 18:52.040]  I hope you're taking notes.
[18:54.180 --> 18:54.580]  Yeah.
[18:55.420 --> 18:57.420]  Why did it say hostile area on that pipe?
[18:58.260 --> 19:00.120]  I think you get shot if they see you on the pipe,
[19:00.200 --> 19:01.920]  but not if you're above it or below it.
[19:02.100 --> 19:02.500]  I see.
[19:03.180 --> 19:04.840]  It's a very specific range.
[19:07.240 --> 19:08.720]  Uh, OK, how do I get down?
[19:10.400 --> 19:11.380]  That's a different thing.
[19:11.440 --> 19:12.620]  I don't need any more coins.
[19:13.640 --> 19:14.800]  Oh, I could swan dive.
[19:15.740 --> 19:16.560]  Let's just do that.
[19:16.660 --> 19:17.860]  I was going to escape via the...
[19:17.860 --> 19:18.180]  No.
[19:19.060 --> 19:19.680]  Hostile pipe.
[19:20.360 --> 19:21.060]  Oh, it's not even a pipe.
[19:21.820 --> 19:22.500]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[19:22.540 --> 19:23.060]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[19:24.240 --> 19:24.940]  Oh, there's stairs.
[19:25.100 --> 19:25.500]  I'm an idiot.
[19:25.820 --> 19:26.560]  I'm so dumb.
[19:26.860 --> 19:27.560]  There are just stairs.
[19:28.380 --> 19:29.980]  Well, it's fine if you take the stairs.
[19:30.080 --> 19:32.600]  If you hang off up there, though, we will kill you.
[19:33.300 --> 19:33.540]  Swan dive.
[19:34.840 --> 19:35.860]  Nope, pipe.
[19:36.100 --> 19:37.060]  Pipe slide.
[19:37.680 --> 19:38.640]  A non-hostile pipe.
[19:41.620 --> 19:43.720]  Well, I shot him at a distance
[19:43.720 --> 19:45.840]  that I killed every guard in the place.
[19:46.360 --> 19:47.900]  That is, that is Hitman.
[19:48.480 --> 19:50.280]  I will try not to repeat that.
[19:54.340 --> 19:56.300]  OK, 2000 XP.
[20:02.240 --> 20:03.420]  What did I get?
[20:04.600 --> 20:05.240]  Gloves.
[20:05.680 --> 20:07.000]  Oh, hell yeah.
[20:09.280 --> 20:11.300]  Oh, that is fantastic.
[20:12.280 --> 20:14.320]  OK, well, I am.
[20:14.740 --> 20:15.520]  Oh, wait.
[20:16.720 --> 20:17.060]  What?
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.500]  They're going to rebuild him?
[20:19.480 --> 20:20.800]  Stronger than the T-100.
[20:21.420 --> 20:23.160]  They've taken him to Japan.
[20:24.340 --> 20:26.540]  This is actually what he went through when he broke his leg.
[20:26.900 --> 20:28.400]  This is the exact process.
[20:30.720 --> 20:31.300]  What the fuck?
[20:35.880 --> 20:37.220]  Was that it?
[20:37.320 --> 20:38.360]  That was it.
[20:38.360 --> 20:39.700]  That was the cutscene?
[20:40.120 --> 20:42.420]  That was such a...
[20:43.740 --> 20:46.400]  I wonder if he had like a clause in his contract
[20:46.400 --> 20:48.520]  where it's like, I can't actually be killed, though.
[20:48.780 --> 20:49.940]  Oh, that's interesting.
[20:50.480 --> 20:53.660]  And to that I say, don't be an elusive target.
[20:54.900 --> 20:55.240]  That it?
[20:55.340 --> 20:57.960]  Well, I guess that's what was so cool about Sean Bean, right?
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.880]  Who was the previous one of he's died so many times and like narratively made sense.
[21:02.480 --> 21:06.600]  He was the perfect fit for the first celebrity elusive target.
[21:06.600 --> 21:08.160]  Well, that was my run.
[21:08.760 --> 21:10.440]  Let's let's see how you do, Gavin.
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.860]  I'm excited to watch you have the pressure flip.
[21:13.380 --> 21:15.380]  OK. OK, my turn.
[21:15.640 --> 21:16.500]  It's your turn.
[21:17.080 --> 21:19.740]  Let's see if you can get in there and actually fight him
[21:19.740 --> 21:25.340]  and not shoot him from a mile away awkwardly and take him out.
[21:25.740 --> 21:29.620]  It is imperative that Quinn survives the fight. Optional.
[21:29.820 --> 21:32.580]  I am really excited to just pull this up on YouTube later.
[21:32.700 --> 21:34.560]  Just watch the fight in its entirety.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.680]  OK. Oh, wow.
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.160]  You're in a fancy suit, Doc.
[21:40.380 --> 21:41.200]  You already have a suit.
[21:41.920 --> 21:45.600]  You are positioned for success already tonight.
[21:46.760 --> 21:49.160]  Where's the stairwell of the gallery?
[21:51.300 --> 21:53.160]  I mean, you might get up here, can I?
[21:54.320 --> 21:56.220]  No, no, no, no.
[21:56.620 --> 21:57.580]  It's off limits.
[21:57.660 --> 21:58.360]  You can't go up there.
[21:59.240 --> 22:04.960]  Is this the first assassination in which you can just kill the person publicly
[22:04.960 --> 22:06.180]  and everyone's OK with it?
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.920]  Because it's part of the rule set, I guess.
[22:10.680 --> 22:15.460]  Maybe I can't think of another one where you can just openly kill the target
[22:15.460 --> 22:17.780]  and everyone's like, yeah, all good.
[22:18.020 --> 22:22.560]  It's the first time that the witnesses are like they paid to witness that.
[22:23.720 --> 22:26.140]  It's not like a witness to a horrendous crime.
[22:26.260 --> 22:28.600]  It was literally the event that they came to see.
[22:28.860 --> 22:31.140]  Yeah, they've all paid good money for it.
[22:32.020 --> 22:32.940]  Looking sharp, sir.
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.880]  Oh, oh, OK.
[22:37.680 --> 22:39.400]  Just I'm just testing the waters here.
[22:39.820 --> 22:41.780]  Yeah, you're figuring stuff out.
[22:43.380 --> 22:44.420]  The Cloud Serpent.
[22:45.140 --> 22:45.920]  Probably not there.
[22:46.540 --> 22:48.980]  OK, so my stash should be around here somewhere.
[22:50.620 --> 22:51.820]  Oh, did you end up stashing?
[22:52.240 --> 22:52.900]  Is that what you put?
[22:52.980 --> 22:54.780]  You put the pistol in the gun.
[22:56.300 --> 22:58.140]  I said gallery stairwell, but.
[22:59.780 --> 23:02.060]  Hmm. I didn't pay attention to.
[23:02.940 --> 23:05.560]  Maybe there's a door under the stairs.
[23:09.450 --> 23:10.490]  No. Oh.
[23:12.030 --> 23:13.670]  No. Yeah, shit.
[23:14.250 --> 23:19.610]  Well, that's why I don't stash stuff typically is I'm so bad at finding the box later.
[23:20.390 --> 23:21.790]  Is it on the stairs?
[23:22.830 --> 23:24.530]  Hello, sir. Thank you.
[23:24.890 --> 23:25.670]  Who's that?
[23:26.810 --> 23:30.210]  It's a. Serpent snake.
[23:32.010 --> 23:33.990]  Snake force or whatever his name was,
[23:33.990 --> 23:35.890]  whatever they said, the security system guy.
[23:37.090 --> 23:39.550]  All right. Well, I'll try not to use the gun.
[23:41.850 --> 23:45.010]  You think that as you're taking your time looking for your gun,
[23:45.190 --> 23:50.150]  he's just getting the shit beaten out of them like that event is still occurring,
[23:50.150 --> 23:51.270]  despite you not being there.
[23:53.250 --> 23:55.390]  Why did someone turn white on my mini-map just then?
[23:55.950 --> 23:56.550]  Don't know.
[23:59.650 --> 24:01.870]  OK, to the fight, to the fight.
[24:02.490 --> 24:05.390]  So one of my favorite things about Hitman games is they're like
[24:05.390 --> 24:10.450]  they're designed almost like clocks, like everything is set to a pattern
[24:10.450 --> 24:12.310]  and it typically will loop.
[24:12.770 --> 24:16.990]  And it's just trying to figure out like every corner of that design.
[24:18.470 --> 24:22.110]  But thankfully, typically events like this don't start
[24:22.110 --> 24:24.230]  until you actually enter the area. Yeah.
[24:27.750 --> 24:28.730]  I'm lost.
[24:30.090 --> 24:33.050]  Uh, I think if you go back the way you can't.
[24:33.110 --> 24:34.270]  OK, yeah, go straight.
[24:35.410 --> 24:36.170]  And then left.
[24:37.590 --> 24:40.730]  Through this way? Yeah, I think through there will kick you back out
[24:40.730 --> 24:42.070]  to like where you could end the round.
[24:43.010 --> 24:44.910]  The Cloud Serpent, that was the name I was looking for.
[24:45.630 --> 24:47.350]  Cloud Serpent sounds like a VPN.
[24:50.570 --> 24:52.390]  Go get yourself some Cloud Serpent.
[24:53.590 --> 24:55.550]  Become a Cloud Serpent. Code regulation.
[24:58.990 --> 24:59.770]  Oh, there you go.
[25:00.650 --> 25:03.290]  And that's the bell. You're oh, dude, you're in such a good spot.
[25:05.810 --> 25:08.070]  Oh, you just personally didn't like that guy.
[25:08.110 --> 25:09.210]  I can avoid the camera.
[25:09.730 --> 25:11.870]  Oh, the camera. I didn't even notice the camera.
[25:11.970 --> 25:13.210]  I thought you were just saying.
[25:14.290 --> 25:16.910]  Now, is this a terrible act that's OK?
[25:18.710 --> 25:19.970]  The rounds are infinite.
[25:20.930 --> 25:24.290]  Oh, well, we're going to see that we're about to see.
[25:26.270 --> 25:27.790]  Oh, it's going to be really funny
[25:27.790 --> 25:30.270]  if they start and you immediately just stop it.
[25:32.350 --> 25:34.450]  Round in, round out.
[25:40.030 --> 25:42.350]  You think he did motion capture for this?
[25:42.770 --> 25:46.330]  To what extent was Conor McGregor involved, you think, in this process?
[25:49.470 --> 25:53.130]  I bet they took a mobile recording studio to him,
[25:53.470 --> 25:55.210]  and that was all that happened. Yes.
[25:58.330 --> 26:01.670]  So, of course, ladies and men,
[26:01.750 --> 26:06.450]  ladies and men, ladies and men.
[26:08.630 --> 26:12.970]  I'm going to he's really got one move that he's doing here.
[26:21.910 --> 26:23.150]  Hell, yeah, Tim.
[26:25.810 --> 26:27.390]  The bell just rang itself.
[26:27.690 --> 26:29.970]  Holy shit. I got to get me one of the bells.
[26:31.590 --> 26:33.310]  Ring it, ring it.
[26:34.210 --> 26:34.930]  Round over.
[26:36.910 --> 26:38.370]  Yeah, why don't you do one?
[26:43.530 --> 26:44.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:44.610 --> 26:46.230]  Get out of here. Do better.
[26:47.290 --> 26:48.210]  All right. How do I get down there?
[26:48.530 --> 26:50.570]  I shot it. I'm on camera.
[26:51.590 --> 26:53.170]  OK, well, that doesn't matter now.
[26:53.410 --> 26:54.690]  Go left, down and left.
[27:01.410 --> 27:02.490]  Oh, look at you.
[27:02.490 --> 27:03.750]  You're nailing this man.
[27:04.450 --> 27:05.610]  Go convince Tim.
[27:07.530 --> 27:09.050]  I'm above his room.
[27:10.030 --> 27:10.790]  There's the pipe.
[27:11.230 --> 27:12.410]  The pipe is suspicion.
[27:14.570 --> 27:17.010]  Oh, what if I just assassins created him right there?
[27:18.090 --> 27:21.070]  Considering the optional objective is don't kill Tim.
[27:21.350 --> 27:22.490]  Probably not ideal.
[27:24.530 --> 27:26.230]  Oh, oh, OK.
[27:26.690 --> 27:27.450]  Dude, he did it.
[27:27.690 --> 27:29.810]  Oh, you're still trespassing, trespassing, trespassing.
[27:31.570 --> 27:34.470]  Gavin, Gavin, no, you got it.
[27:34.650 --> 27:37.170]  Oh, oh, my God.
[27:37.350 --> 27:38.410]  Gavin, Gavin.
[27:41.010 --> 27:43.270]  Oh, that was so close.
[27:43.990 --> 27:47.010]  OK, then that could have been closer.
[27:47.990 --> 27:49.730]  Not good. Oh, my God.
[27:51.810 --> 27:52.270]  Where's he going?
[27:52.510 --> 27:53.330]  He's coming back.
[27:53.350 --> 27:54.910]  He's like, fucking see that?
[27:55.630 --> 27:56.910]  I think I just climbed that pipe.
[27:57.050 --> 27:58.710]  That was almost really suspicious.
[27:59.810 --> 28:00.430]  Where is he?
[28:02.150 --> 28:03.550]  Oh, it's because the guy interrupted.
[28:03.810 --> 28:04.510]  I see. OK.
[28:07.290 --> 28:08.230]  He's got a coin.
[28:09.470 --> 28:11.170]  What if I shot him with a cannon?
[28:11.990 --> 28:13.410]  That would be fucking awesome.
[28:16.930 --> 28:18.230]  So I think the move is
[28:19.370 --> 28:21.730]  maybe trying to take out that guard once he goes in.
[28:23.990 --> 28:26.330]  I'm hoping the guard just clears off and I can just.
[28:28.810 --> 28:29.890]  Get into the room.
[28:32.710 --> 28:33.230]  OK.
[28:34.150 --> 28:35.010]  I like that.
[28:36.150 --> 28:37.030]  I like that.
[28:40.070 --> 28:40.590]  Squoop.
[28:41.230 --> 28:42.390]  They're looking the wrong way.
[28:47.770 --> 28:48.470]  Oh, dear.
[28:50.250 --> 28:51.110]  Oh, God.
[28:52.050 --> 28:52.690]  How do I? OK.
[28:53.610 --> 28:55.170]  What's what's the eagle vision again?
[28:55.570 --> 28:56.010]  OK.
[29:08.070 --> 29:09.550]  Too many bastards in there.
[29:10.710 --> 29:12.150]  Oh, that's a lot of bastards in there.
[29:13.590 --> 29:14.050]  All right.
[29:14.050 --> 29:15.070]  You can turn it off.
[29:15.570 --> 29:16.210]  You can alert him.
[29:18.210 --> 29:19.170]  Oh, he's going to.
[29:19.550 --> 29:22.310]  Oh, that's a jackpot.
[29:23.430 --> 29:25.050]  Oh, that makes it so much easier.
[29:25.810 --> 29:27.370]  I thought I was going to take each guard out.
[29:29.690 --> 29:30.890]  Oh, he's got a guard.
[29:31.710 --> 29:33.290]  He's going to bring him over and then choke him out.
[29:34.110 --> 29:35.410]  Oh, that is unfortunate.
[29:35.550 --> 29:36.430]  Oh, no.
[29:38.590 --> 29:39.350]  Oh, no.
[29:39.450 --> 29:43.530]  Well, you could get the guard on this run and then you can pull him again
[29:43.530 --> 29:44.870]  and then get him potentially.
[29:46.650 --> 29:47.390]  That's true.
[29:49.270 --> 29:51.690]  It's going to be really near a window that I get that choke.
[29:59.670 --> 30:01.610]  Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[30:02.790 --> 30:03.230]  Whoa.
[30:05.650 --> 30:06.090]  Nice.
[30:07.430 --> 30:08.910]  Oh, what a choke.
[30:09.490 --> 30:10.070]  Get him in there.
[30:10.630 --> 30:11.070]  Yeah.
[30:12.030 --> 30:13.070]  Should I be him?
[30:13.850 --> 30:15.890]  Uh, I mean, if you want, I guess.
[30:16.610 --> 30:19.130]  I'd be shocked if he didn't recognize you as a fake.
[30:19.410 --> 30:21.370]  Considering you're like his personal guard.
[30:21.830 --> 30:22.190]  Holy shit.
[30:22.250 --> 30:23.050]  No enforcers.
[30:25.910 --> 30:28.150]  This is great.
[30:30.110 --> 30:30.870]  All right.
[30:32.210 --> 30:33.870]  Just use my key.
[30:35.090 --> 30:36.470]  Nice little sneak in.
[30:36.850 --> 30:37.910]  Oh, he's he's working.
[30:38.770 --> 30:40.530]  Can I crush his throat with a...
[30:42.050 --> 30:43.330]  You probably...
[30:43.330 --> 30:44.530]  I'll just...
[30:44.530 --> 30:45.490]  Hey, I'll spot you, dude.
[30:46.270 --> 30:46.910]  Oh, my God.
[30:46.930 --> 30:47.790]  I can be a spotter.
[30:49.710 --> 30:50.790]  Is he gonna walk over?
[30:52.550 --> 30:53.810]  No, he's staring you down.
[30:53.870 --> 30:55.570]  He's feeling your chi right now.
[30:55.710 --> 30:57.090]  He's sensing your aura.
[30:58.050 --> 30:59.090]  What are you chi on over here?
[31:00.110 --> 31:01.150]  There was a...
[31:01.150 --> 31:05.410]  There was a fight, Gavin, last week where...
[31:06.050 --> 31:07.450]  Oh, he's leaving.
[31:07.890 --> 31:08.730]  Oh, no, he's leaving.
[31:09.650 --> 31:10.270]  I missed it.
[31:10.510 --> 31:10.890]  Fuck.
[31:11.010 --> 31:11.250]  Damn it.
[31:12.210 --> 31:12.630]  Damn it.
[31:12.990 --> 31:13.830]  I think you got...
[31:13.830 --> 31:16.210]  Dude, I think he's going back.
[31:17.130 --> 31:17.990]  You think I just do him here?
[31:17.990 --> 31:19.070]  I think you have to.
[31:20.470 --> 31:22.090]  Unless you want to redo the round.
[31:24.890 --> 31:25.250]  Oh.
[31:27.890 --> 31:28.610]  Oh, shit.
[31:30.750 --> 31:31.470]  Oh, boy.
[31:31.730 --> 31:33.130]  You gotta get him back to that box.
[31:36.410 --> 31:37.210]  Oh, you got him.
[31:38.050 --> 31:38.810]  You got him.
[31:39.430 --> 31:40.030]  All good.
[31:40.470 --> 31:41.510]  No one's gonna see nothing.
[31:41.630 --> 31:42.290]  You're all good.
[31:43.270 --> 31:46.370]  I was hoping to crush him with his own weights, but he didn't feel like working out.
[31:46.470 --> 31:47.710]  That's why he's not gonna win the fight.
[31:47.710 --> 31:51.870]  Honestly, probably not a bad move that that happened the way it did.
[31:51.970 --> 31:54.490]  Because those other guys in the room would have not liked it.
[31:55.370 --> 31:55.490]  Yeah.
[31:56.490 --> 31:58.170]  Can you disguise yourself still?
[31:58.630 --> 31:58.830]  Yeah.
[31:59.050 --> 32:00.250]  I just need to find the right...
[32:00.250 --> 32:01.010]  Oh, the right angle.
[32:01.410 --> 32:01.890]  Shitting.
[32:02.230 --> 32:02.570]  Oh, oh.
[32:03.130 --> 32:03.690]  There you go.
[32:11.650 --> 32:13.550]  What if I lose the fight?
[32:14.170 --> 32:15.050]  What if...
[32:15.550 --> 32:16.090]  What if...
[32:16.090 --> 32:20.230]  What if you just pull out a pistol as soon as the bell rings?
[32:20.830 --> 32:23.610]  Yeah, should I stash my guns?
[32:23.730 --> 32:24.930]  Because what if they search me?
[32:24.970 --> 32:26.730]  Probably not a bad idea.
[32:28.130 --> 32:29.530]  I think I'd dump the guns.
[32:30.870 --> 32:32.230]  Dump anything suspicious.
[32:33.270 --> 32:34.410]  Dump my puke gun.
[32:34.970 --> 32:35.730]  Dump the scissors.
[32:37.250 --> 32:38.370]  Dump my coin.
[32:38.610 --> 32:39.790]  Yeah, you can get rid of everything.
[32:40.070 --> 32:42.010]  You're gonna do a selfie in there with him.
[32:42.010 --> 32:43.350]  Gotta keep the camera.
[32:45.950 --> 32:48.430]  Fighters known for having to take the camera to their shorts.
[32:48.630 --> 32:51.210]  You know, if they're like kicked in the balls or whatever, they need to readjust.
[32:52.470 --> 32:53.230]  All the gear.
[32:57.740 --> 32:58.700]  I'm so excited.
[32:59.300 --> 33:02.540]  The combat in this game, the hand-to-hand combat is not much, typically.
[33:03.040 --> 33:04.820]  It's like one combo and then a knockout.
[33:09.350 --> 33:10.710]  Oh, this is so cool.
[33:11.950 --> 33:14.930]  Can't believe I can just openly murder him.
[33:15.310 --> 33:16.190]  Or get murdered.
[33:20.370 --> 33:21.490]  Oh, who are we?
[33:34.460 --> 33:36.100]  Diana, can you shut up?
[33:36.700 --> 33:40.920]  Oh, this is so... this is the steroid McGregor all the way.
[33:42.660 --> 33:44.560]  This is back when he was doing the show house.
[33:47.000 --> 33:47.480]  Mr. Doe.
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.200]  Oh, man.
[33:59.960 --> 34:02.420]  What a fucking weird world we live in.
[34:02.700 --> 34:03.760]  This is great.
[34:05.160 --> 34:07.280]  Oh, you don't even control the fight.
[34:07.900 --> 34:08.320]  Quick time.
[34:08.320 --> 34:10.320]  Oh, shit.
[34:12.340 --> 34:14.100]  Oh, it is a minigame.
[34:14.360 --> 34:15.720]  This is awesome.
[34:16.720 --> 34:17.780]  I have to block and I have to hit.
[34:25.560 --> 34:27.080]  This is so cool.
[34:27.180 --> 34:28.000]  I'm so mad.
[34:28.080 --> 34:29.020]  I missed this.
[34:30.140 --> 34:30.380]  Wallop.
[34:30.680 --> 34:32.660]  Oh, shut your face in, son.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.220]  Oh, oh, get him, get him.
[34:35.380 --> 34:36.380]  Oh, oh.
[34:36.740 --> 34:37.480]  Let's go.
[34:37.940 --> 34:38.420]  Wallop.
[34:38.700 --> 34:39.960]  Oh, this is fucking awesome.
[34:39.960 --> 34:40.300]  Get him up.
[34:41.740 --> 34:42.840]  Oh, no.
[34:43.320 --> 34:44.400]  Oh, my God.
[34:45.620 --> 34:47.120]  He's dead.
[34:47.520 --> 34:48.500]  Oh, you killed him.
[34:52.240 --> 34:53.660]  Holy shit.
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.940]  Oh, I could just leave via the microphone.
[35:00.580 --> 35:02.740]  Oh, cut a promo.
[35:03.880 --> 35:06.300]  Cut a promo and leave.
[35:10.620 --> 35:12.080]  Hell, yeah.
[35:12.080 --> 35:14.080]  I just...
[35:16.000 --> 35:16.820]  That's so cool.
[35:16.820 --> 35:18.480]  That's such a weird elusive target.
[35:18.580 --> 35:19.060]  I love it.
[35:19.160 --> 35:20.280]  Oh, that's awesome.
[35:23.440 --> 35:28.580]  Oh, I should have shot the freaking hard drives because I would have got silent assassin for that.
[35:28.660 --> 35:29.420]  Oh, you would have.
[35:30.960 --> 35:31.760]  Four stars.
[35:32.420 --> 35:32.780]  Wow.
[35:32.980 --> 35:33.360]  Not bad.
[35:33.360 --> 35:34.900]  Complete opposite runs.
[35:35.720 --> 35:38.700]  I'm so glad that you pulled that off and I was able to see what that looks like.
[35:39.060 --> 35:39.600]  That was amazing.
[35:39.600 --> 35:43.540]  Well, I felt like I had to after I caused your run to just immediately erupt into chaos.
[35:43.840 --> 35:44.840]  Listen, it was my run.
[35:45.080 --> 35:45.900]  I fucked that up.
[35:45.980 --> 35:46.700]  That was all on me.
[35:46.780 --> 35:48.940]  But, man, what a great job.
[35:50.180 --> 35:50.800]  Getting that XP.
[35:51.300 --> 35:52.980]  Did you unlock anything else that I didn't?
[35:56.000 --> 35:56.480]  Let's see.
[35:56.580 --> 35:57.620]  Are we going to get the...
[35:58.240 --> 35:59.760]  Well, at least we get to see this again.
[36:00.860 --> 36:01.860]  What the fuck?
[36:05.820 --> 36:08.520]  I really hope that he is...
[36:08.520 --> 36:09.260]  Well, I don't know.
[36:09.260 --> 36:11.100]  Actually, I'm conflicted.
[36:11.340 --> 36:13.260]  This is really done in a great way, but also...
[36:17.960 --> 36:19.380]  I want that just...
[36:19.380 --> 36:20.620]  I want that as a sound drop.
[36:21.620 --> 36:22.340]  What the fuck?
[36:22.440 --> 36:23.220]  So good.
[36:23.820 --> 36:26.180]  Well, that was us taking on the elusive target.
[36:26.340 --> 36:28.000]  You saw what happens when it goes wrong.
[36:28.380 --> 36:30.060]  You saw what happens when it goes right.
[36:30.860 --> 36:32.400]  Thank you so much for watching.
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.620]  Make sure to check out our podcast, Regulation Podcast.

[36:39.660 --> 36:40.500]  Thank you so much for watching.
[36:40.600 --> 36:41.240]  This has been a lot of fun.
[36:42.120 --> 36:42.840]  Thank you.
[36:43.620 --> 36:45.100]  Thank you for being here, Gavin.
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.880]  I'm excited to maybe do more of these with you.
[36:48.020 --> 36:48.780]  You and I both love Hitman so much.
[36:48.780 --> 36:50.000]  Yeah, I love me some Hitman.
[36:50.160 --> 36:51.320]  Yeah, we gotta get deeper.
[36:51.320 --> 36:52.820]  Maybe we could do some head-to-head stuff.
[36:53.240 --> 36:53.980]  Oh, that'd be so cool.
[36:54.000 --> 36:55.020]  See who does the better thing.
[36:55.540 --> 36:56.580]  I like that a lot.
[36:57.040 --> 36:57.900]  We'll figure something out.
[36:58.040 --> 36:59.880]  We both love this game so much.
[37:00.040 --> 37:00.660]  We'll find a way.
[37:00.980 --> 37:01.260]  Bye!
[37:02.240 --> 37:02.840]  Bye now.
