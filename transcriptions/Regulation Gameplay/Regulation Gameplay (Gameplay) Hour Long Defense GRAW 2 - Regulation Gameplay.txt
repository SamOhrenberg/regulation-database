[00:00.000 --> 00:00.600]  I'm dead.
[00:01.440 --> 00:02.200]  Oh, the people!
[00:03.200 --> 00:06.400]  Uh, Nick, Nick did our countdown and started at one.
[00:09.000 --> 00:09.800]  I'm dead.
[00:10.920 --> 00:11.720]  I died.
[00:11.820 --> 00:12.260]  Oh, that's good.
[00:12.360 --> 00:14.680]  I want you all to die because I'm spectating for some reason.
[00:14.880 --> 00:15.380]  Well, why are you?
[00:15.380 --> 00:16.340]  Why didn't you ready up?
[00:16.840 --> 00:18.000]  I don't know.
[00:18.100 --> 00:18.680]  I don't know what happened.
[00:18.800 --> 00:19.820]  I'm pretty sure I hit Y.
[00:20.080 --> 00:20.580]  All right.
[00:20.600 --> 00:23.660]  So I don't think this is coming out, but let's talk about it just in case.
[00:23.880 --> 00:24.820]  Uh, what are we doing, Gavin?
[00:25.140 --> 00:27.880]  We're trying to redo the achievement that we struggled to do.
[00:28.380 --> 00:29.900]  I would say over 10 years ago.
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.720]  Where we have to defend on a court map for an hour, literal 60 minutes.
[00:34.720 --> 00:36.960]  I want everyone just to chill for a second.
[00:37.120 --> 00:38.240]  I really appreciate that.
[00:38.400 --> 00:39.680]  Uh, the concept here.
[00:39.860 --> 00:40.880]  Thank you so much, Gavin.
[00:41.060 --> 00:45.340]  He did hit Y, which is the play spectate button instead of the ready button.
[00:45.940 --> 00:47.560]  I hit Y to play.
[00:49.380 --> 00:49.820]  Yeah.
[00:50.640 --> 00:51.720]  So what do you think happened?
[00:52.440 --> 00:53.680]  Put me to spectate.
[00:55.620 --> 00:56.060]  So...
[00:56.060 --> 00:57.260]  God, this music.
[00:57.700 --> 00:58.860]  I will say this, Gav.
[00:58.860 --> 01:02.940]  When we played this game back in the day, uh, we played it a lot.
[01:03.300 --> 01:04.700]  With people that played it a lot.
[01:04.940 --> 01:08.640]  Now we're playing it after a 10 year hiatus with three people that have never played it.
[01:08.640 --> 01:09.980]  I've never played this game.
[01:10.400 --> 01:12.800]  I think I got the achievement over 15 years ago.
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.020]  And I remember dying at like 58 minutes and 30 seconds.
[01:18.640 --> 01:22.060]  Oh, the frickin frame rate, dude.
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.120]  This is brutal.
[01:23.580 --> 01:24.400]  How do you go prone?
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.400]  Uh, in on the left stick.
[01:26.880 --> 01:27.760]  B changes guns.
[01:28.900 --> 01:30.160]  That's, that's squat.
[01:30.840 --> 01:31.800]  You get hit it again.
[01:31.840 --> 01:33.800]  You go down, like hold in on the left stick to go down.
[01:34.460 --> 01:34.860]  Nice.
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.500]  Oh, there's people, people, uh, to the, to the West.
[01:41.740 --> 01:42.500]  Oh, shit loads.
[01:42.680 --> 01:43.440]  Dude, you gotta get us.
[01:46.060 --> 01:46.660]  They're coming.
[01:46.660 --> 01:47.540]  They're coming around the bend.
[01:49.660 --> 01:51.200]  What the hell is reload?
[01:51.840 --> 01:52.580]  Probably X.
[01:52.820 --> 01:53.260]  Oh, A.
[01:53.440 --> 01:53.700]  A.
[01:53.880 --> 01:54.220]  What?
[01:55.000 --> 01:55.400]  Yup.
[01:55.460 --> 01:56.100]  Makes no sense.
[01:57.940 --> 01:59.220]  Craziest reload button.
[01:59.800 --> 02:02.840]  This is such an ugly, milky game.
[02:03.140 --> 02:06.460]  This, this is the thing you guys kept talking about?
[02:06.780 --> 02:09.580]  I'm embarrassed at the games I used to think were great.
[02:10.040 --> 02:11.820]  This is what we had to choose.
[02:11.980 --> 02:13.960]  I mean, this is what, these were our options, man.
[02:18.300 --> 02:21.380]  Oh, I'm getting, I'm just getting lambasted, dude.
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.240]  This is brutal.
[02:22.580 --> 02:23.040]  Now hide.
[02:23.780 --> 02:24.540]  Oh, bollocks.
[02:24.760 --> 02:24.840]  Yeah.
[02:24.940 --> 02:26.580]  Don't, don't, don't get lambasted.
[02:27.760 --> 02:29.900]  How do you, how do you switch over the shoulder?
[02:30.640 --> 02:32.100]  Uh, right bumper, left bumper, I think.
[02:32.220 --> 02:32.620]  Or just right bumper?
[02:32.840 --> 02:33.520]  Oh, we're getting pushed, Nick.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.060]  We're getting pushed.
[02:34.640 --> 02:34.880]  Oh!
[02:35.660 --> 02:38.900]  Alright, I'm, I'm, I'm holding off from the west.
[02:39.860 --> 02:40.940]  Did I just run out of ammo?
[02:40.940 --> 02:41.160]  Oh my God.
[02:41.240 --> 02:41.940]  Oh, they're pushing.
[02:41.960 --> 02:42.380]  Oh my God.
[02:42.820 --> 02:44.000]  Oh, they're pushing on us.
[02:44.180 --> 02:44.440]  Ugh.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.420]  How do we get ammo?
[02:46.040 --> 02:47.820]  I thought you had, I thought it was unlimited ammo.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.240]  And Eric, don't walk in front of a shooting man.
[02:50.260 --> 02:52.020]  I don't remember ammo being an issue in this.
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.340]  So I swapped to single fire.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.500]  I think you can pick up, I think you can
[02:57.500 --> 02:59.320]  probably, oh fuck.
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.020]  Oh, nice.
[03:01.220 --> 03:01.560]  Thank you.
[03:01.840 --> 03:05.000]  I think you can probably, uh, pick up ammo off the dead bodies.
[03:05.400 --> 03:05.760]  I would assume.
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.500]  How do you switch gun?
[03:07.000 --> 03:07.100]  B.
[03:07.240 --> 03:07.600]  A.
[03:07.900 --> 03:08.260]  B.
[03:08.580 --> 03:08.940]  DALF.
[03:08.980 --> 03:09.300]  Damn it.
[03:11.760 --> 03:12.260]  Oh yeah.
[03:12.340 --> 03:13.280]  Single fire is way better.
[03:14.520 --> 03:15.120]  How do you do that?
[03:15.200 --> 03:15.300]  Oh!
[03:15.740 --> 03:16.240]  Hold A.
[03:17.020 --> 03:19.200]  Hold A and then, and then right on the D-pad.
[03:19.780 --> 03:20.420]  Oh God.
[03:20.440 --> 03:21.200]  My gun, my gun.
[03:21.680 --> 03:23.100]  It does not have, you don't have that.
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.460]  Oh, there's a guy that's prone over there.
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.220]  He's trying to get advanced.
[03:26.820 --> 03:27.180]  All right.
[03:27.180 --> 03:28.380]  Uh, how long we got left?
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.700]  57 minutes left.
[03:31.720 --> 03:32.020]  Oh, it does.
[03:32.600 --> 03:32.740]  No.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.180]  I'm going to try to grab a gun.
[03:35.500 --> 03:36.240]  See if it gives me ammo.
[03:38.400 --> 03:39.880]  Did not, did not give me ammo.
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.100]  What do we do?
[03:43.040 --> 03:44.380]  Do we have to go, go find the ammo?
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.380]  I'm down.
[03:46.200 --> 03:47.760]  How do we get him up?
[03:49.140 --> 03:50.300]  Is there a way to get him up?
[03:50.600 --> 03:51.300]  Uh, where is he?
[03:51.360 --> 03:51.740]  I'll come.
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.040]  Oh shit.
[03:53.860 --> 03:55.220]  Nick is just staring at my body.
[03:55.400 --> 03:55.580]  Yeah.
[03:55.600 --> 03:55.780]  Yeah.
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.780]  He wants to just see it.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.740]  I don't know what to do.
[04:01.260 --> 04:01.920]  Oh shit.
[04:01.960 --> 04:03.020]  You guys are miles away.
[04:03.080 --> 04:03.800]  No, we're not.
[04:05.120 --> 04:05.920]  Uh, medic.
[04:06.040 --> 04:06.800]  Who's a medic?
[04:07.100 --> 04:07.820]  Uh, oh, here.
[04:08.840 --> 04:09.860]  I'll be the medic.
[04:10.920 --> 04:12.660]  I don't know exactly.
[04:12.740 --> 04:14.900]  Oh, my stomach hurts.
[04:15.820 --> 04:18.160]  I got a tummy ache, guys.
[04:20.820 --> 04:22.200]  What does Y do?
[04:22.380 --> 04:24.280]  Oh, I'm holding Y and that seems to pick up.
[04:24.300 --> 04:24.660]  I got you.
[04:24.740 --> 04:24.920]  Okay.
[04:24.980 --> 04:25.720]  Oh, thanks Geoff.
[04:25.720 --> 04:26.380]  Is it Y button?
[04:26.680 --> 04:26.940]  Yeah.
[04:26.940 --> 04:27.440]  Y button.
[04:27.520 --> 04:28.120]  How do you reload?
[04:28.900 --> 04:28.980]  A.
[04:29.100 --> 04:29.360]  A.
[04:29.400 --> 04:29.680]  A.
[04:29.680 --> 04:29.840]  Okay.
[04:30.040 --> 04:30.160]  A.
[04:30.580 --> 04:32.420]  God, this is so unintuitive.
[04:32.720 --> 04:33.240]  Holy shit.
[04:33.720 --> 04:34.500]  We got this now.
[04:34.940 --> 04:36.040]  Dude, we got a little area.
[04:36.220 --> 04:36.760]  I love this.
[04:36.940 --> 04:37.620]  We're just holding them off.
[04:37.620 --> 04:38.380]  We can hold here.
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.320]  This is a real good choke point.
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.500]  I feel really good about where I'm positioned.
[04:42.720 --> 04:43.620]  I'm, I'm prone.
[04:44.100 --> 04:45.460]  Oh, you shot me!
[04:45.760 --> 04:46.960]  You shot me!
[04:47.360 --> 04:48.320]  Geoff killed Nick.
[04:49.020 --> 04:50.580]  Geoff killed Nick four minutes in.
[04:50.840 --> 04:52.980]  You shot me in the back of the head.
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.050]  Who shot him?
[04:54.660 --> 04:55.120]  What do you mean?
[04:56.120 --> 04:57.220]  It wasn't me.
[04:57.920 --> 04:59.380]  Said so in the...
[04:59.380 --> 05:02.900]  Oh no, I saw him die in front of me, but I'm pretty sure it was Gavin or somebody else.
[05:03.220 --> 05:03.500]  Nuh-uh.
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.700]  I'm pretty sure it was one of you guys.
[05:05.720 --> 05:06.440]  Coming out from the right.
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.020]  I'm just going to look to the right.
[05:09.540 --> 05:09.720]  Okay.
[05:09.860 --> 05:10.500]  I mean, I'm walking.
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.240]  I'm looking left, so.
[05:11.280 --> 05:17.580]  A funny feature of this game that I remember, if I remember properly, is that, you know, we're obviously in discord recording.
[05:18.000 --> 05:18.300]  I'm dead.
[05:18.640 --> 05:22.400]  In the game, when you die, you get kicked out of the lobby chat too.
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.700]  And you go into a dead lobby chat.
[05:23.720 --> 05:24.140]  Oh really?
[05:24.460 --> 05:24.780]  Yeah.
[05:25.420 --> 05:27.980]  So you'd hear people be like, oh shit, there's a...
[05:28.820 --> 05:33.200]  And all the people in the dead chat would just say,
[05:33.780 --> 05:34.180]  TANK!
[05:34.300 --> 05:34.780]  Ah shit.
[05:36.300 --> 05:37.940]  Oh, Geoff, they don't see you yet.
[05:38.120 --> 05:39.160]  You got so lucky there, Geoff.
[05:39.900 --> 05:40.100]  Yeah.
[05:40.140 --> 05:41.340]  They don't know where the fuck you are.
[05:43.140 --> 05:45.400]  I can't believe Geoff shot me in the back of the head.
[05:45.420 --> 05:46.740]  I'm so sorry, dude.
[05:47.240 --> 05:52.300]  The only thing I'm concerned with, with what we're doing is that I don't know how to get more ammo.
[05:53.500 --> 05:54.280]  Should we look it up?
[05:54.280 --> 05:54.860]  Yeah.
[05:54.860 --> 05:56.380]  It might be like we have to go to a box.
[05:56.380 --> 05:57.300]  Oh, Geoff's down.
[05:57.780 --> 05:58.020]  I'm down.
[05:58.040 --> 05:59.300]  He's got a tummy ache too.
[06:00.420 --> 06:01.840]  Oh, my tummy, my tummy.
[06:02.000 --> 06:02.700]  You know what we should do?
[06:02.760 --> 06:08.840]  We should just release this as like a 15 minute little bonus, uh, for like the bog standard crowd.
[06:09.160 --> 06:09.480]  Yeah.
[06:09.920 --> 06:10.880]  You don't want to go for an hour?
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.180]  What, you don't want to just do this?
[06:13.020 --> 06:13.720]  Oh, we could.
[06:13.800 --> 06:18.340]  I just figured there was some reading involved and looking up to figure out what the best map and tactics are.
[06:18.400 --> 06:19.820]  We could just look up how to do...
[06:19.820 --> 06:21.560]  We could easily blow that up in like two minutes though.
[06:22.240 --> 06:22.660]  All right.
[06:22.660 --> 06:23.460]  You go look it up right now.
[06:24.060 --> 06:24.840]  Instead of shooting.
[06:25.760 --> 06:27.720]  Well, you're not going to fucking watch me.
[06:27.840 --> 06:28.960]  You have 54 minutes to go.
[06:31.440 --> 06:32.160]  I don't believe in them.
[06:32.160 --> 06:32.620]  I don't believe in them.
[06:33.920 --> 06:34.380]  All right.
[06:34.400 --> 06:35.020]  Look it up.
[06:37.920 --> 06:38.920]  They were partying.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.020]  They were like, whoo.
[06:41.660 --> 06:42.780]  Fucking got those guys.
[06:42.940 --> 06:44.400]  I got 31 kills.
[06:44.640 --> 06:45.500]  We've got this.
[06:45.820 --> 06:45.980]  Who?
[06:46.100 --> 06:47.540]  The guy that never played got 31.
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.960]  Oh, I'm not bad at video games.
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.040]  I've just never played this.
[06:51.560 --> 06:52.900]  Well, then we don't have anything to worry about then.
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.120]  Doesn't sound like that.
[06:54.120 --> 06:55.360]  I don't, I don't know about that.
[06:55.520 --> 06:56.720]  Geoff killed Nick.
[06:57.660 --> 06:59.240]  Yeah, well, I also killed 29 other people.
[07:00.300 --> 07:00.520]  Right.
[07:00.600 --> 07:02.100]  But I got a lot to worry about, apparently.
[07:02.400 --> 07:02.480]  Yeah.
[07:04.660 --> 07:05.380]  Is there...
[07:05.380 --> 07:08.280]  Nick also moved in front of me while I was firing.
[07:08.320 --> 07:09.740]  No, Nick stood perfectly still.
[07:09.780 --> 07:10.420]  Oh, that's not happening.
[07:10.940 --> 07:12.200]  We are looking down in the sights.
[07:13.780 --> 07:15.700]  There doesn't appear to be a sensitivity.
[07:15.940 --> 07:16.200]  No.
[07:16.380 --> 07:17.020]  I'm looking at.
[07:17.060 --> 07:17.800]  Oh, great.
[07:17.880 --> 07:18.560]  I love that.
[07:20.780 --> 07:22.180]  Headquarters is the easiest map.
[07:22.180 --> 07:23.620]  OK, let's do that.
[07:23.820 --> 07:25.700]  OK, you must use default settings.
[07:25.940 --> 07:31.220]  OK, the best method is to have your whole team use M36 saw with the single shot
[07:31.220 --> 07:33.100]  burst to conserve ammo.
[07:33.480 --> 07:35.820]  Oh, so we're trying to conserve ammo?
[07:36.560 --> 07:36.860]  Saw.
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.700]  OK, so you got that, Gavin?
[07:41.400 --> 07:41.640]  Yep.
[07:43.040 --> 07:45.860]  You can pick up ammo of the same caliber as yours.
[07:46.720 --> 07:51.520]  Oh, so then so then when you probably pick up enemy weapons, then you just keep
[07:51.520 --> 07:56.920]  grabbing their ammo, like so just run through your saw until we got done and then grab enemy
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.120]  ammo and then go with that, I would assume.
[07:59.440 --> 08:03.780]  Oh, this is based on me, a guy who's never played this game before.
[08:04.320 --> 08:07.740]  So we'll just have we'll take it in turns for like a little ammo runs and have everyone
[08:07.740 --> 08:08.840]  cover the spot.
[08:09.060 --> 08:11.640]  Yeah, we had in six minutes.
[08:11.760 --> 08:15.500]  We had a pile of 80 enemy bodies and Nick to choose from.
[08:15.900 --> 08:18.540]  So, yep.
[08:19.380 --> 08:20.840]  OK, all right.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.860]  Ready up.
[08:21.980 --> 08:22.400]  Let's do it.
[08:22.900 --> 08:26.020]  So pick the M4 saw and then change to single shot.
[08:26.500 --> 08:26.600]  Yeah.
[08:27.860 --> 08:31.600]  And they can only attack from two places at once from what I'm reading.
[08:32.900 --> 08:33.960]  Oh, there's grenades.
[08:34.480 --> 08:35.260]  Yeah, there are.
[08:37.700 --> 08:39.040]  M4 saw, is that what you said?
[08:39.280 --> 08:39.940]  M34 saw.
[08:40.120 --> 08:41.300]  M34 saw, sorry.
[08:42.000 --> 08:42.680]  Where is it?
[08:42.840 --> 08:43.280]  R4?
[08:43.340 --> 08:43.840]  I don't see it.
[08:44.140 --> 08:45.080]  M36 saw.
[08:45.320 --> 08:46.040]  Maybe that's it.
[08:48.640 --> 08:49.920]  That was a long time ago.
[08:50.000 --> 08:50.480]  Where did he go?
[08:51.140 --> 08:53.040]  Yeah, I also lost it.
[08:53.160 --> 08:54.240]  Oh, I got kicked from the game.
[08:54.940 --> 08:55.740]  I have 600.
[08:56.820 --> 08:57.480]  You got kicked?
[08:57.760 --> 08:58.980]  Yeah, it just says this game is over.
[08:58.980 --> 08:59.820]  Oh, I said I found it.
[09:00.160 --> 09:00.500]  Oh, no.
[09:00.940 --> 09:01.540]  Whoa, are you on Wi-Fi?
[09:01.960 --> 09:04.120]  No, I'm still plugged in from yesterday.
[09:04.340 --> 09:04.580]  Will you?
[09:05.340 --> 09:06.020]  Oh, shit.
[09:06.100 --> 09:06.820]  I guess Simeon.
[09:06.900 --> 09:08.160]  Why did you kill me?
[09:08.400 --> 09:08.640]  Sorry.
[09:08.780 --> 09:09.800]  I was looking for the gun.
[09:10.400 --> 09:11.540]  No, no.
[09:12.400 --> 09:13.100]  Nick wins.
[09:14.500 --> 09:15.900]  No way, Andrew.
[09:15.900 --> 09:16.240]  No.
[09:16.560 --> 09:18.200]  Andrew's going, no, no.
[09:21.400 --> 09:23.220]  I surrender, I surrender, I surrender.
[09:23.820 --> 09:24.960]  I'm one of you, I'm one of you.
[09:24.980 --> 09:26.100]  I'm one of you, I'm one of you.
[09:27.660 --> 09:28.340]  Please, sir.
[09:28.480 --> 09:28.960]  I'm back in.
[09:29.880 --> 09:30.640]  Back into what?
[09:30.720 --> 09:31.840]  We all got, we're all dead.
[09:32.020 --> 09:32.560]  I'm in the lobby.
[09:33.900 --> 09:34.620]  Oh, OK.
[09:34.740 --> 09:35.260]  Mission failed.
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.480]  Yeah, well, I know what I'm looking for now.
[09:38.080 --> 09:43.320]  It'll be funny when Eric and Nick and stuff get the achievement to look at when we got the achievement, Geoff.
[09:43.720 --> 09:43.940]  Yeah.
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.060]  Yeah, when we get the achievement.
[09:47.520 --> 09:47.960]  Oh, we got.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.420]  OK, yeah, we got it.
[09:49.420 --> 09:52.580]  We know we have to pick this gun really fast now.
[09:52.780 --> 09:54.320]  There's so many guns.
[09:55.060 --> 09:56.140]  So many guns.
[09:56.320 --> 09:57.700]  I think go scroll down.
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.380]  Nope, don't do that.
[09:59.700 --> 10:00.040]  All right.
[10:00.120 --> 10:01.000]  Saw, I'm in.
[10:01.140 --> 10:02.940]  If you go up, it's faster, right?
[10:02.960 --> 10:03.940]  Like, it's closer, faster.
[10:04.160 --> 10:05.940]  Yeah, I just said it's my default.
[10:06.380 --> 10:06.620]  How?
[10:06.680 --> 10:07.160]  That's smart.
[10:07.560 --> 10:10.160]  Oh, is it the A-36 saw or is it a different one?
[10:10.640 --> 10:12.220]  It's the M-36 saw.
[10:12.400 --> 10:12.840]  M-36 saw.
[10:12.840 --> 10:17.420]  And then if you hit X, save as default rifleman, I think that's it.
[10:18.840 --> 10:21.220]  Oh, so where's where's the best spot?
[10:21.420 --> 10:24.080]  I think I think we're dude where you were is the fucking guy.
[10:24.340 --> 10:26.980]  Honestly, if we are all spread out here to cover that entrance,
[10:27.060 --> 10:29.700]  they all funnel to the left of the water tanks.
[10:29.920 --> 10:30.300]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10:30.520 --> 10:35.560]  I'm I'm they have to basically come between this fuel tanker and that Hummer.
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.040]  Yep.
[10:37.540 --> 10:37.820]  Humpy.
[10:38.240 --> 10:40.080]  I mean, Gavin, where you were is good.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.240]  OK, you'll take her in the Hummer.
[10:42.360 --> 10:42.760]  Let me see.
[10:42.860 --> 10:45.100]  And then Nick, I mean, just Nick is like way out there.
[10:45.420 --> 10:46.180]  Yeah, I'm way too far.
[10:46.380 --> 10:46.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:47.420 --> 10:48.380]  Well, I'm just going to get back.
[10:49.100 --> 10:49.920]  All right. Here they come.
[10:50.160 --> 10:50.480]  Here they come.
[10:50.680 --> 10:51.240]  You guys are down.
[10:51.400 --> 10:52.080]  I'm above you.
[10:52.180 --> 10:53.560]  So don't stand up without letting me.
[10:53.760 --> 10:55.180]  That's pretty good. Oh, right in the head.
[10:58.780 --> 11:00.700]  I'm going to see if I can not miss the whole game.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.300]  OK, yeah, 59 more minutes, don't miss.
[11:03.560 --> 11:04.280]  Let me know what you do.
[11:04.840 --> 11:05.940]  I could get 600 kills.
[11:06.340 --> 11:07.080]  59 more times.
[11:07.320 --> 11:07.780]  That was easy.
[11:08.700 --> 11:09.180]  You may.
[11:12.180 --> 11:13.320]  Well, expectation gone.
[11:13.840 --> 11:15.240]  So now you just have fun.
[11:17.420 --> 11:18.760]  Oh, these guys are toast.
[11:22.140 --> 11:23.620]  I haven't seen someone yet.
[11:24.000 --> 11:24.820]  It's good. It's good.
[11:26.760 --> 11:28.700]  Whoever gets the most kills picks lunch.
[11:29.220 --> 11:30.180]  Oh, come on.
[11:31.240 --> 11:32.760]  Haven't even seen a guy yet.
[11:32.900 --> 11:33.200]  Nope.
[11:35.280 --> 11:36.020]  Oh, all right.
[11:36.160 --> 11:38.060]  Oh, here they go.
[11:38.140 --> 11:39.240]  It's popping off.
[11:43.600 --> 11:45.120]  I fired two bullets.
[11:46.520 --> 11:47.580]  I have one kill.
[11:47.780 --> 11:48.460]  Feel good about it.
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.020]  Yeah, I'm questioning my positioning.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.640]  I'm I'm not worried about my positioning.
[11:52.820 --> 11:55.480]  I'm not trying to be the number one guy here.
[11:55.520 --> 11:56.820]  I'm a support system.
[11:57.100 --> 11:59.300]  I'm I'm a steel beam. Lean on me.
[11:59.700 --> 12:01.860]  Yeah, we'll be leaning on you when I need to go out there and get a gun.
[12:02.080 --> 12:03.320]  Yeah, we're all bodies.
[12:03.480 --> 12:04.420]  How many bullets you got, Gav?
[12:06.160 --> 12:06.780]  553 left.
[12:07.060 --> 12:09.740]  OK, well, there's a guy prone there.
[12:09.960 --> 12:13.320]  Some of these guys are going prone and stuff is interesting.
[12:16.660 --> 12:17.580]  People coming left.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.120]  Someone's covering the left side, right?
[12:19.120 --> 12:19.640]  I got it. Yeah.
[12:24.320 --> 12:27.560]  Well, they're starting to come around to the right of the tanks now.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.000]  You got him. You got him.
[12:30.900 --> 12:31.220]  Reloading.
[12:32.680 --> 12:34.120]  Could have picked a better time to do that.
[12:34.620 --> 12:35.180]  Well, you got it.
[12:35.220 --> 12:36.600]  But just make sure you move when you do.
[12:37.320 --> 12:39.520]  Just make sure you're like out of harm's way, I guess.
[12:40.720 --> 12:41.140]  Good call.
[12:41.880 --> 12:42.660]  Oh, nice shot, Geoff.
[12:43.080 --> 12:43.380]  Thank you.
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.140]  Yeah, Geoff just went to Bip Town.
[12:47.680 --> 12:48.520]  Dude, Bipin's fun.
[12:49.900 --> 12:50.840]  Oh, OK, I'm all right.
[12:53.720 --> 12:55.200]  57 more minutes of that.
[13:00.680 --> 13:02.480]  Oh, some guys get pretty close.
[13:06.180 --> 13:06.980]  I'm locked in.
[13:07.100 --> 13:10.400]  There's three guys to like Nik's left that are not moving.
[13:10.540 --> 13:12.580]  And I'm just locked in as soon as they move their toes.
[13:13.420 --> 13:13.840]  Mm hmm.
[13:15.140 --> 13:16.060]  You see those two, Andrew?
[13:16.560 --> 13:16.920]  Mm hmm.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.740]  Oh, I think I have a reload problem.
[13:20.740 --> 13:22.660]  I realize I reload too frequently in games.
[13:22.820 --> 13:23.780]  Oh, definitely.
[13:24.020 --> 13:27.000]  That's such a habit because ammo is unlimited and it doesn't matter.
[13:27.100 --> 13:28.660]  It doesn't take any time and you can get hit a bunch.
[13:28.820 --> 13:29.560]  So it like doesn't matter.
[13:29.660 --> 13:30.240]  This game, it matters.
[13:33.080 --> 13:34.160]  I haven't reloaded yet.
[13:35.400 --> 13:36.820]  Oh, oh, Nick's down.
[13:38.040 --> 13:38.760]  What happened?
[13:38.880 --> 13:41.080]  The right side, the right side, the right side.
[13:41.080 --> 13:42.080]  They're lining up.
[13:42.560 --> 13:43.160]  Do you want to try?
[13:43.180 --> 13:43.640]  No, I'm dead.
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.140]  You're dead, dead, dead.
[13:45.140 --> 13:46.540]  He's toast. He's dead, dead, dead.
[13:47.740 --> 13:48.220]  Coming in.
[13:48.700 --> 13:49.840]  They came around the water tanks.
[13:55.860 --> 13:57.680]  What are you doing the next 56 minutes, Nick?
[13:57.780 --> 13:58.180]  Just hanging out?
[14:00.760 --> 14:01.720]  Snack time.
[14:03.580 --> 14:04.980]  Nick in his natural habitat.
[14:05.580 --> 14:06.020]  Yeah, right.
[14:07.900 --> 14:08.580]  Come on.
[14:09.860 --> 14:10.500]  Peek around.
[14:11.080 --> 14:11.500]  You're good.
[14:15.650 --> 14:17.730]  Whoa, whoa, what the fuck was that?
[14:17.810 --> 14:18.610]  They're throwing grenades.
[14:19.150 --> 14:19.690]  Holy shit.
[14:19.730 --> 14:20.510]  What's the grenade button?
[14:23.330 --> 14:24.070]  What is it?
[14:24.150 --> 14:24.690]  Wait, they have grenades?
[14:26.390 --> 14:27.990]  We have six grenades, I think.
[14:28.490 --> 14:31.110]  OK, no idea how to throw one.
[14:32.850 --> 14:33.290]  No.
[14:35.110 --> 14:36.390]  Shall I try and find out?
[14:36.610 --> 14:37.470]  No, no.
[14:40.070 --> 14:41.610]  Maybe Eric is great.
[14:43.990 --> 14:45.290]  I don't like it when they shoot.
[14:45.890 --> 14:47.010]  Yeah, it scares me.
[14:48.150 --> 14:50.970]  Hey, I mean, either I can't believe you're gone already.
[14:52.490 --> 14:53.190]  Who are you spectating?
[14:54.090 --> 14:55.150]  I'm just flipping around.
[14:55.150 --> 14:55.350]  OK.
[14:56.630 --> 14:57.070]  Stop.
[14:57.350 --> 14:58.610]  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[14:59.250 --> 15:00.290]  Who shot me there?
[15:00.710 --> 15:01.510]  Bad guys.
[15:02.330 --> 15:03.270]  Did you shoot me, Geoff?
[15:03.410 --> 15:05.210]  No, I was getting shot, too.
[15:05.690 --> 15:06.750]  That's why I was screaming as well.
[15:07.690 --> 15:08.490]  They were getting both of us.
[15:08.950 --> 15:10.310]  I'm not trying to get tricky or anything, Nick.
[15:10.330 --> 15:11.930]  I'm a support system, a steel beam here.
[15:12.670 --> 15:13.590]  What's a left bumper do?
[15:13.870 --> 15:14.270]  Nothing.
[15:15.190 --> 15:17.410]  Oh, bumper switch.
[15:18.850 --> 15:22.230]  D-pad, cauldron.
[15:23.050 --> 15:24.730]  I'm my second reload of the five.
[15:24.730 --> 15:25.810]  You're moving the drone.
[15:28.210 --> 15:30.910]  Shit, I got to get back to shooting.
[15:31.410 --> 15:34.270]  Yep. I didn't know why guys were coming in.
[15:34.570 --> 15:36.970]  I didn't succeed in figuring out what the grenade buttons are.
[15:39.370 --> 15:41.590]  Maybe it's like a what you have to switch to it with Y or something.
[15:42.130 --> 15:42.410]  Maybe.
[15:43.370 --> 15:45.270]  Is there actually a hole over there, Andrew?
[15:46.110 --> 15:48.250]  Yeah, yeah, they sometimes pop out through there.
[15:49.770 --> 15:51.930]  Oh, it's hold hold be.
[15:52.930 --> 15:53.890]  Hold be.
[15:54.530 --> 15:56.290]  And then select it from the radio wheel.
[15:57.150 --> 15:59.370]  And then I'm going to throw one as a test.
[16:01.330 --> 16:02.630]  Oh, that's a bad throw.
[16:03.030 --> 16:03.610]  That's a bad throw.
[16:03.730 --> 16:05.030]  It bounced right in front of Gavin.
[16:05.550 --> 16:06.950]  Oh, I'm dead.
[16:09.590 --> 16:10.330]  I'm dead.
[16:10.810 --> 16:13.230]  I have five hundred and seventy eight bullets left.
[16:13.330 --> 16:16.070]  I'm dead as a bad throw on my part.
[16:16.190 --> 16:18.090]  I hit the ceiling, hit the ceiling.
[16:18.450 --> 16:19.870]  Am I the only one alive?
[16:19.870 --> 16:21.970]  Gavin, my bitch.
[16:22.310 --> 16:22.770]  Nope.
[16:23.150 --> 16:24.330]  OK, yeah, just you.
[16:24.530 --> 16:26.450]  I think Gavin caught the worst of it.
[16:26.730 --> 16:28.550]  I think my head came off.
[16:28.890 --> 16:33.450]  I flipped the juxtapositive and the grenade bounced off the roof.
[16:33.710 --> 16:33.890]  Yeah.
[16:35.290 --> 16:37.410]  Oh, I didn't even get to die.
[16:37.550 --> 16:39.350]  That's some, Gavin, that's some bullshit.
[16:41.290 --> 16:42.770]  They captured the base.
[16:42.870 --> 16:43.470]  Gavin didn't quit.
[16:43.630 --> 16:46.710]  Oh, oh, yeah, we're actually defending.
[16:46.710 --> 16:50.550]  Oh, Gavin, that was incredible.
[16:53.170 --> 16:55.010]  It was just not allowed grenades.
[16:55.650 --> 16:56.990]  Well, Nick was already dead anyway.
[16:57.610 --> 16:57.950]  Yeah.
[16:59.310 --> 17:02.210]  It doesn't take away from the fact that you're not allowed grenades.
[17:03.530 --> 17:04.530]  Oh, my God.
[17:05.010 --> 17:07.450]  I just be careful that you're watching clearance.
[17:07.610 --> 17:08.810]  Watch your head space when you throw them.
[17:09.770 --> 17:09.990]  Yeah.
[17:10.230 --> 17:12.130]  I'm the one that figured out how to use a grenade.
[17:12.430 --> 17:12.530]  Everybody.
[17:12.650 --> 17:13.970]  Nobody needed to.
[17:14.350 --> 17:16.130]  Oh, you're the only one that wanted to.
[17:16.130 --> 17:17.430]  We needed to.
[17:18.050 --> 17:20.970]  If it helps, I don't I still don't know how to do it.
[17:21.030 --> 17:22.190]  And I don't want to do it.
[17:22.270 --> 17:22.570]  Yeah.
[17:23.110 --> 17:23.630]  Hold B.
[17:26.050 --> 17:26.550]  Oh, no.
[17:27.010 --> 17:27.390]  At the ceiling.
[17:27.570 --> 17:28.230]  OK, thanks, man.
[17:28.550 --> 17:29.670]  Maybe don't completely.
[17:29.710 --> 17:31.090]  It wasn't even directly at the ceiling.
[17:32.570 --> 17:34.170]  Wow. Saving that gun is the default.
[17:34.330 --> 17:35.030]  Fucking rocks.
[17:35.130 --> 17:35.810]  Holy shit.
[17:36.130 --> 17:36.850]  Pretty good, isn't it?
[17:36.910 --> 17:38.670]  And it's the what is it again?
[17:38.710 --> 17:40.330]  The M36 saw.
[17:40.670 --> 17:41.510]  Save is default.
[17:41.810 --> 17:42.570]  Boom. There we go.
[17:42.930 --> 17:44.710]  So where's the actual thing that we're defending?
[17:44.710 --> 17:45.950]  Is it just this spot on the ground?
[17:46.570 --> 17:46.850]  The flares?
[17:47.170 --> 17:47.650]  The flares.
[17:47.710 --> 17:48.170]  I believe so.
[17:50.590 --> 17:51.190]  I'm going to be right here.
[17:51.490 --> 17:52.350]  Feel good about my spot.
[17:52.530 --> 17:53.370]  I was defending well.
[17:53.590 --> 17:55.230]  I feel like everyone was in a really good position.
[17:55.750 --> 17:56.830]  Everyone was doing a really good job.
[17:57.150 --> 17:57.790]  And then Nick died.
[17:58.550 --> 17:59.690]  Yeah, and then went to shit.
[17:59.710 --> 18:01.130]  I'm going to stay over here.
[18:01.530 --> 18:02.270]  I'm going to stay over here.
[18:02.270 --> 18:02.870]  Find a different spot.
[18:03.230 --> 18:03.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:05.430 --> 18:06.290]  Where'd you end up, Nick?
[18:06.890 --> 18:07.450]  Where were you?
[18:07.450 --> 18:07.910]  Behind you guys.
[18:08.030 --> 18:09.030]  Were you over here?
[18:09.230 --> 18:09.950]  Yeah, yeah, he was.
[18:10.150 --> 18:10.170]  Yeah.
[18:10.490 --> 18:12.350]  But he wasn't like behind the truck or anything.
[18:12.670 --> 18:14.090]  Yeah, they flooded from the right of the tanks.
[18:14.470 --> 18:16.010]  I'll hang behind the truck this time.
[18:16.070 --> 18:16.730]  Oh, Geoff will do it.
[18:16.850 --> 18:16.950]  All right.
[18:17.090 --> 18:17.530]  Oh, you know what?
[18:17.790 --> 18:19.530]  Change your gun to single fire.
[18:19.670 --> 18:20.330]  Change to single shot.
[18:20.710 --> 18:21.190]  Good call.
[18:22.170 --> 18:22.690]  Thank you.
[18:25.690 --> 18:26.270]  All right.
[18:26.290 --> 18:27.390]  Let's see what we see.
[18:28.130 --> 18:29.090]  Gavin, I'm not in your way, am I?
[18:29.470 --> 18:29.670]  No.
[18:30.090 --> 18:30.270]  OK.
[18:34.370 --> 18:35.410]  Is there a way to peek out?
[18:36.590 --> 18:37.330]  I don't think so.
[18:37.630 --> 18:39.350]  I think this was pre-peek technology.
[18:41.110 --> 18:42.190]  That could have been a peek.
[18:42.430 --> 18:43.930]  Military hadn't invented peeking yet.
[18:43.930 --> 18:47.130]  The military made you look normal style.
[18:49.110 --> 18:50.630]  Oh, that's a dead body.
[18:54.470 --> 18:55.270]  Bip. Bip.
[18:58.810 --> 18:59.610]  He bippin'?
[18:59.610 --> 19:00.990]  You think you found a good spot, Geoff?
[19:01.570 --> 19:03.330]  I mean, I feel safe here.
[19:03.530 --> 19:07.550]  I'm not nobody's making it to my my field of view, but I think that's fine.
[19:08.010 --> 19:08.450]  That's the same.
[19:08.630 --> 19:10.130]  We don't all need to fire.
[19:10.390 --> 19:11.450]  I'm in the same spot.
[19:11.990 --> 19:13.810]  They're going to they're going to come to you pretty soon.
[19:14.210 --> 19:16.810]  OK. At about the six minute mark, I'm already down.
[19:17.710 --> 19:19.610]  What? I'm alive, though.
[19:19.950 --> 19:20.590]  Did somebody pick it up?
[19:20.730 --> 19:21.630]  You want to come get me, Eric?
[19:21.790 --> 19:22.650]  Where? Where are you?
[19:22.710 --> 19:23.690]  I'm right behind Gavin.
[19:23.950 --> 19:24.690]  I got you. I got you.
[19:24.690 --> 19:25.210]  Andrew's got you.
[19:25.730 --> 19:26.350]  OK. OK.
[19:27.950 --> 19:28.590]  Thank you.
[19:29.290 --> 19:30.090]  How did you die?
[19:31.270 --> 19:33.610]  Uh, I just got shot standing behind Gavin.
[19:34.750 --> 19:35.350]  Oh, are you not?
[19:35.350 --> 19:36.110]  You go down again.
[19:36.210 --> 19:37.110]  You're not. No, I'm crouched.
[19:37.670 --> 19:40.590]  OK, then I'm going to shot a little bit, actually.
[19:41.810 --> 19:43.030]  I think I got hit by the Nick fire.
[19:46.010 --> 19:49.090]  Not your gun, but people aiming at you, right?
[19:49.950 --> 19:52.050]  And there's a lot of red libs over there.
[19:52.450 --> 19:53.850]  Yeah, they're all just right there.
[19:54.490 --> 19:55.350]  Not peeking out.
[19:57.050 --> 19:58.250]  Yeah, there's a
[19:59.370 --> 20:00.710]  15 of them or so, maybe
[20:01.930 --> 20:02.770]  on my screen.
[20:02.970 --> 20:04.670]  Oh, yeah, there's like there's like a lot.
[20:04.750 --> 20:06.110]  They're all just bunched up, not moving.
[20:07.070 --> 20:07.670]  I'm fine with it.
[20:07.790 --> 20:08.430]  12 of them. Yeah.
[20:08.450 --> 20:10.470]  They can stay there for another 57 minutes if they want to.
[20:10.550 --> 20:11.530]  Hey, I got no problem with that.
[20:11.530 --> 20:14.970]  This guy is moving so fucking slowly on my screen.
[20:15.970 --> 20:16.570]  He's a.
[20:17.050 --> 20:21.430]  Mm mm mm mm.
[20:21.790 --> 20:22.730]  I'm a fucking shoot.
[20:22.830 --> 20:23.150]  He's dead.
[20:24.250 --> 20:26.870]  He's just crawling his way to get fucking bit by Gavin.
[20:28.550 --> 20:30.570]  It's actually quite funny on my screen.
[20:33.710 --> 20:35.950]  I'm definitely going to run out of ammo first.
[20:36.330 --> 20:37.110]  Yeah, definitely.
[20:37.570 --> 20:39.330]  Well, somebody can just fill in for you.
[20:39.570 --> 20:39.970]  That's true.
[20:40.470 --> 20:41.410]  We'll just rotate.
[20:42.230 --> 20:43.850]  You're in like the mouth of the funnel.
[20:44.390 --> 20:45.150]  You're in mouth.
[20:49.850 --> 20:51.730]  There's two guys coming up fast.
[20:51.910 --> 20:54.050]  Boom, boom, boom.
[20:54.250 --> 20:55.870]  Nice getting in a nice view.
[20:56.170 --> 20:57.470]  Take them off at the knees.
[20:57.770 --> 20:58.770]  I can't see shit.
[20:59.370 --> 21:02.710]  I don't know if they threw a smoke bomb or what, but I can't see fucking anything.
[21:07.660 --> 21:09.260]  They're starting to kind of creep up here.
[21:09.480 --> 21:11.460]  Yeah, they're getting, I guess, close in the gap.
[21:12.700 --> 21:14.480]  He's going to fucking die painfully.
[21:17.280 --> 21:19.260]  God, can you imagine doing this as a job?
[21:19.580 --> 21:22.960]  And you go home and you're like, yeah, I killed 7000 people today.
[21:24.860 --> 21:25.780]  How was work?
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.500]  Real day to remember.
[21:29.400 --> 21:30.260]  I'm different.
[21:30.780 --> 21:31.940]  A real therapy day.
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.180]  I'm different.
[21:37.090 --> 21:40.510]  They're all little chickens, too scared to come.
[21:41.630 --> 21:42.970]  That's fine. Let them be that.
[21:42.970 --> 21:45.710]  There's three, four, five, six of them.
[21:46.590 --> 21:48.290]  It's like there's six of them there now.
[21:48.810 --> 21:49.510]  They're slowly.
[21:54.030 --> 21:54.750]  Two, three.
[21:54.950 --> 21:56.470]  Oh, there's a great spot to be in.
[21:57.010 --> 21:58.890]  Yeah. Yeah, I wish I'd been there.
[21:59.130 --> 22:00.370]  I get a good view of what's.
[22:00.370 --> 22:01.390]  Yeah, you were like way up.
[22:01.550 --> 22:03.550]  I was really surprised by how far up you were.
[22:04.690 --> 22:07.770]  For some reason, I didn't think that the that had a cross section
[22:07.770 --> 22:09.830]  where the where I got shot from earlier.
[22:10.950 --> 22:14.130]  This might be the easiest video we've ever made.
[22:14.910 --> 22:16.030]  All right. It's left, Geoff.
[22:16.310 --> 22:17.210]  Fifty five. Yeah.
[22:17.290 --> 22:19.010]  Think of it as a as a rhythm game.
[22:19.330 --> 22:22.310]  Yeah. Just press the right trigger when it's in the circle.
[22:24.150 --> 22:25.550]  Oh, shit. OK, they hit me.
[22:26.610 --> 22:27.450]  Get a little cocky.
[22:28.830 --> 22:29.190]  No need to.
[22:29.350 --> 22:30.550]  You want to come back over here?
[22:30.990 --> 22:31.950]  Everybody keep your cocks in.
[22:34.450 --> 22:35.950]  I really want to throw a grenade.
[22:36.370 --> 22:38.590]  Gavin is just unloading on these dudes.
[22:39.070 --> 22:39.830]  Boom, dead.
[22:42.010 --> 22:42.430]  Just watching.
[22:42.930 --> 22:45.250]  I'm just watching diamonds disappear in front of me.
[22:47.110 --> 22:48.530]  I miss that guy a lot.
[22:49.070 --> 22:50.510]  Wasted like three bullets on that idiot.
[22:51.390 --> 22:53.450]  It's like there's only five and they're all improne.
[22:53.610 --> 22:54.730]  Oh, there's one over here.
[22:55.110 --> 22:56.690]  Might be a sneaky little Janna.
[22:57.350 --> 22:58.790]  Oh, a little sneaky, sneaky to the right.
[23:00.090 --> 23:02.030]  Two guys, two guys over to the right.
[23:02.030 --> 23:02.970]  Fall back, Andrew, I'll cover you.
[23:03.150 --> 23:04.030]  I can't hit them.
[23:05.150 --> 23:06.130]  From where they are.
[23:11.080 --> 23:12.980]  I got an overlapping field of fire with you.
[23:14.360 --> 23:15.000]  Come on.
[23:16.420 --> 23:16.780]  Dead.
[23:19.160 --> 23:19.980]  I didn't get either.
[23:20.060 --> 23:20.600]  You got them.
[23:20.660 --> 23:21.120]  I didn't get either.
[23:22.140 --> 23:22.760]  Sorry, Andrew.
[23:22.860 --> 23:23.820]  I didn't mean to take those from you.
[23:24.420 --> 23:25.080]  No, I'm good.
[23:28.280 --> 23:28.920]  54 minutes.
[23:29.600 --> 23:30.460]  I didn't want you to die.
[23:32.740 --> 23:34.080]  We're like 10% done.
[23:34.500 --> 23:34.680]  Yeah.
[23:36.380 --> 23:37.900]  Oh, I'm so tempted by the grenades.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.720]  How do you go into first person with the weapons again?
[23:42.200 --> 23:42.640]  What?
[23:42.640 --> 23:42.980]  What?
[23:44.240 --> 23:45.080]  Like down sights?
[23:46.640 --> 23:47.220]  I guess we can't.
[23:47.220 --> 23:47.380]  Trigger?
[23:47.620 --> 23:48.500]  What are you talking about?
[23:49.020 --> 23:51.560]  I had a gun last time where I could go first person on it.
[23:51.700 --> 23:53.000]  Oh, that's cool.
[23:53.820 --> 23:55.020]  It's more of a marksman gun.
[23:56.880 --> 23:58.680]  Looks like they're piling up.
[23:59.260 --> 24:00.100]  Yeah, they're starting to.
[24:03.220 --> 24:06.580]  I mean, it's Xbox 360 AI, so I'm not super concerned.
[24:06.760 --> 24:06.940]  Yeah.
[24:07.040 --> 24:09.740]  I don't think they're going to find new ways to innovate.
[24:09.740 --> 24:13.320]  I think that's a good thing, but sometimes AI was just bullshit.
[24:13.780 --> 24:15.300]  Yeah, it was designed to overwhelm.
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.020]  It was the most insane grenade that wouldn't be physically possible.
[24:19.400 --> 24:21.240]  I experienced that a couple minutes ago, actually.
[24:26.670 --> 24:29.410]  Looks like we're down to five of them.
[24:30.270 --> 24:31.990]  Oh, there's a few more stragglers coming in.
[24:32.030 --> 24:33.050]  They keep coming out, yeah.
[24:33.650 --> 24:35.230]  How are you doing ammo-wise, Gavin?
[24:35.790 --> 24:38.010]  I have 262 left.
[24:38.290 --> 24:39.010]  Jesus Christ.
[24:39.610 --> 24:41.070]  So I'm over half done.
[24:41.330 --> 24:43.150]  I have 576 bullets.
[24:44.190 --> 24:47.530]  The only problem with where we're shooting them is it's a long way to go to get ammo.
[24:48.710 --> 24:52.470]  Yeah, we might have to do some little ammo excursions.
[24:53.730 --> 24:55.250]  Like bait them up.
[24:55.690 --> 24:58.350]  Andrew, are any of the guns of the guys we killed over here still here?
[24:58.890 --> 24:59.210]  Yep.
[24:59.850 --> 25:02.890]  Okay, there's some over here by us that are easily accessible.
[25:04.330 --> 25:06.730]  I just switched my desk into standing desk mode.
[25:06.730 --> 25:09.290]  I feel like I'm in action.
[25:10.710 --> 25:11.410]  I'm ready.
[25:11.850 --> 25:12.410]  I'm leaning over.
[25:13.110 --> 25:14.790]  I'm facing this screen.
[25:14.950 --> 25:15.650]  I'm holding the elbow.
[25:15.790 --> 25:18.350]  I'm ready to pull the fucking trigger.
[25:18.710 --> 25:21.590]  What's your stance like? Are your legs apart a little bit?
[25:21.750 --> 25:22.830]  Are you feeling full-tilted?
[25:24.530 --> 25:25.950]  Wide, wide stance.
[25:26.370 --> 25:28.430]  I'm a wide stance guy right now, dude.
[25:28.750 --> 25:29.750]  I can't fucking hit that, dude.
[25:29.790 --> 25:30.970]  There's a guy creeping around on the right.
[25:31.130 --> 25:31.650]  Oh, you got him.
[25:32.550 --> 25:33.150]  Dude, there's a creep.
[25:33.790 --> 25:35.050]  I feel like I got pretty close.
[25:35.050 --> 25:37.290]  Oh, there's so many of them just backed up on that truck.
[25:38.490 --> 25:39.070]  What's up?
[25:39.890 --> 25:41.150]  Where I am? Am I in trouble?
[25:42.290 --> 25:43.570]  No, you're okay.
[25:45.550 --> 25:47.290]  Inside the compound.
[25:48.470 --> 25:49.190]  Reloading again.
[25:55.540 --> 25:58.400]  You'd think after the first 500 dudes went down, they'd stop coming.
[25:59.300 --> 26:00.280]  That's what you'd think, yeah.
[26:00.960 --> 26:01.840]  I died.
[26:02.840 --> 26:03.240]  What?
[26:03.700 --> 26:05.120]  An explosion went off and killed me.
[26:05.400 --> 26:05.800]  What happened?
[26:06.240 --> 26:07.080]  Are you serious?
[26:07.600 --> 26:08.880]  Yep, I didn't throw a grenade.
[26:08.940 --> 26:10.000]  What are you doing for the next 51 minutes?
[26:10.420 --> 26:11.040]  Hanging out, man.
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.560]  I have a feeling that Nick is going to struggle to get this achievement.
[26:18.220 --> 26:20.220]  Just based on today so far.
[26:21.180 --> 26:21.620]  Well...
[26:21.620 --> 26:22.360]  What happened?
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.360]  What are you near that exploded?
[26:24.720 --> 26:25.200]  Don't know.
[26:25.580 --> 26:26.340]  Andrew, there's a guy coming up.
[26:26.340 --> 26:26.800]  Are you with us?
[26:26.980 --> 26:31.140]  I walked over towards Andrew to help him and then an explosion went off.
[26:31.880 --> 26:32.980]  Was it good help, Andrew?
[26:33.500 --> 26:35.460]  I didn't know he was there until he died.
[26:36.120 --> 26:36.880]  Did you need help?
[26:37.300 --> 26:38.260]  No, all good.
[26:39.100 --> 26:40.660]  I was just going over to look around.
[26:42.040 --> 26:43.580]  I wasn't out of cover or anything.
[26:45.680 --> 26:47.740]  Oh, they're really piling in now.
[26:47.800 --> 26:49.560]  They're starting to move up.
[26:49.800 --> 26:50.700]  Oh, that's the explosion.
[26:51.260 --> 26:51.760]  I hear explosions, but I don't know.
[26:51.760 --> 26:52.920]  Yeah, they throw grenades sometimes.
[26:53.640 --> 26:54.380]  Yeah, they sure do.
[26:54.620 --> 26:56.140]  I gotta kill, I gotta kill, I gotta kill, I gotta kill!
[26:56.180 --> 26:56.480]  Nice!
[26:57.980 --> 26:58.340]  What?
[26:59.060 --> 27:00.600]  That's a smoke grenade he just threw at me.
[27:01.000 --> 27:01.780]  Oh, yeah it is.
[27:02.500 --> 27:04.360]  Oh, Andrew, you're separated from the crew.
[27:04.700 --> 27:05.600]  Yeah, I'm coming back.
[27:05.740 --> 27:06.860]  I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[27:06.860 --> 27:07.300]  Okay.
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.980]  I just bipped another guy.
[27:11.620 --> 27:12.500]  Bipping's cool, man.
[27:12.740 --> 27:14.020]  I'm a big bipping guy right now.
[27:14.100 --> 27:14.680]  This feels good.
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.180]  Some guys don't have the diamond on them.
[27:17.240 --> 27:17.560]  It's weird.
[27:18.600 --> 27:19.600]  Yeah, that is strange.
[27:20.400 --> 27:20.660]  Oh!
[27:22.100 --> 27:24.300]  Maybe they didn't renew their diamond status.
[27:27.500 --> 27:29.660]  Dude, changing your shoulder makes a big difference here.
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.760]  I can see way more over my left shoulder.
[27:32.480 --> 27:34.040]  Oh, shit, there's a bunch of guys lying down.
[27:34.440 --> 27:35.620]  They all just stood up at the same time.
[27:36.080 --> 27:38.880]  There are guys coming from the left here, I think.
[27:40.160 --> 27:42.440]  You see those diamonds, Geoff, on the left side?
[27:42.500 --> 27:42.740]  Oh, yeah.
[27:44.100 --> 27:45.860]  I'm keeping an eye, see if they're moving up.
[27:46.320 --> 27:48.660]  There's a solid line of them.
[27:48.720 --> 27:49.040]  Got him.
[27:49.580 --> 27:49.720]  One.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.680]  Wow, that guy popped off at me.
[27:55.340 --> 27:56.420]  I'm going to have to reload here soon.
[27:56.920 --> 27:57.220]  No worries.
[27:59.640 --> 28:02.140]  They're going to creep closer, but I can get them if they peek around here.
[28:02.140 --> 28:09.610]  A couple of prone guys here, is that what's going on?
[28:09.890 --> 28:13.530]  There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, about 9.
[28:13.530 --> 28:15.930]  No, no, no, it's those guys on the left.
[28:16.030 --> 28:17.450]  There were a couple of guys that were prone.
[28:17.910 --> 28:19.770]  Oh, there's one guy that was prone climbing in.
[28:19.870 --> 28:21.210]  A little sneaky beaky.
[28:23.870 --> 28:26.730]  That guy just crawled into frame to fucking collapse.
[28:26.850 --> 28:27.410]  That was really funny.
[28:30.330 --> 28:31.650]  Alright, this game's cool.
[28:31.890 --> 28:32.390]  This is fun.
[28:32.670 --> 28:32.990]  Yeah!
[28:33.490 --> 28:34.210]  Yeah, right?
[28:34.390 --> 28:35.410]  See, this is probably a lot of fun.
[28:35.410 --> 28:36.810]  It's a lot of fun for everybody but Nick right now.
[28:37.090 --> 28:38.730]  Yeah, Nick's having fun too.
[28:38.790 --> 28:39.650]  He's probably eating a snack.
[28:40.270 --> 28:41.030]  No, I haven't left.
[28:41.770 --> 28:46.330]  This game ends up just being about trying not to lose concentration for an entire hour.
[28:46.630 --> 28:46.790]  Yeah.
[28:48.090 --> 28:48.670]  Oh, yeah?
[28:51.510 --> 28:53.370]  Nick's working on his cost co-order right now.
[28:53.410 --> 28:54.770]  I'm going to help Andrew.
[28:55.090 --> 28:55.770]  Andrew, do you need help?
[28:56.050 --> 28:56.270]  No.
[28:58.590 --> 29:00.470]  Oh, that guy got a new dick and a new eye.
[29:02.330 --> 29:03.890]  He can put his old dick in his new eye.
[29:08.190 --> 29:09.390]  How's your ammo count, Gavin?
[29:10.130 --> 29:10.530]  Forty.
[29:11.470 --> 29:11.870]  Really?
[29:12.970 --> 29:13.670]  Come up to me.
[29:14.550 --> 29:15.870]  Yeah, do you want to make your way over to Andrew?
[29:16.010 --> 29:17.550]  I can sort of...
[29:17.550 --> 29:17.670]  Sure.
[29:18.270 --> 29:18.870]  Alright, I'm going up.
[29:19.350 --> 29:19.670]  Hang on.
[29:20.550 --> 29:21.490]  Alright, I got your spot.
[29:21.870 --> 29:23.410]  Were you prone or just crouching?
[29:23.410 --> 29:23.830]  I was prone.
[29:24.190 --> 29:25.110]  You can go get my gun.
[29:25.810 --> 29:26.490]  Grab it.
[29:27.070 --> 29:27.910]  Weapon swap right there.
[29:32.070 --> 29:32.950]  Is there a prompt?
[29:33.170 --> 29:34.170]  Oh, weapon swap.
[29:34.690 --> 29:35.010]  Damn it.
[29:35.130 --> 29:35.670]  What was the prompt?
[29:36.610 --> 29:36.950]  Why?
[29:36.950 --> 29:38.490]  I think you just hold the button.
[29:39.110 --> 29:39.790]  Thanks, Andrew.
[29:40.030 --> 29:40.310]  Welcome.
[29:41.770 --> 29:44.290]  Eric is keeping it under control over here.
[29:44.310 --> 29:44.890]  I'm holding it tight.
[29:44.970 --> 29:45.970]  Alright, Gavin, take over.
[29:46.030 --> 29:46.150]  Oh, sorry.
[29:46.650 --> 29:47.070]  No, no, no.
[29:47.070 --> 29:47.430]  You're good.
[29:47.510 --> 29:47.730]  You're good.
[29:48.230 --> 29:48.730]  Just take over.
[29:51.530 --> 29:52.030]  Oh, shit.
[29:52.070 --> 29:52.750]  I'm reloading.
[29:53.130 --> 29:53.410]  Fuck.
[29:56.830 --> 29:58.210]  I'm having so much fun, guys.
[29:58.470 --> 29:59.630]  This is only an automatic.
[30:00.830 --> 30:01.190]  What?
[30:01.750 --> 30:03.330]  I picked up a gun that's auto-loaded.
[30:03.630 --> 30:04.430]  Whenever you pick up...
[30:04.430 --> 30:04.770]  Oh, what?
[30:04.790 --> 30:04.970]  Really?
[30:08.010 --> 30:10.290]  Andrew, there's a stack of dudes over on your side.
[30:10.390 --> 30:11.150]  I don't know if you see them.
[30:11.390 --> 30:12.790]  I see those Diamond Club members.
[30:16.150 --> 30:17.810]  They are active status.
[30:18.930 --> 30:23.010]  I have a bowl of soup in front of me that I've not been able to even get near the spoon.
[30:23.830 --> 30:25.130]  What kind of soup was it?
[30:25.810 --> 30:26.210]  Minestrone.
[30:27.810 --> 30:29.650]  That doesn't keep well at all.
[30:29.870 --> 30:30.630]  Oh, that's sad.
[30:30.790 --> 30:32.190]  Oh, and here I am without a bowl.
[30:33.350 --> 30:34.310]  He's just got a hand full of minestrone.
[30:34.310 --> 30:34.650]  It's coming over.
[30:35.090 --> 30:35.910]  I just got a hand.
[30:36.370 --> 30:38.310]  You want me to come over and feed it to you?
[30:40.430 --> 30:44.930]  That would unironically be more help than you're providing us now.
[30:49.770 --> 30:55.230]  The episode came out today that was, uh, if somebody died on the podcast, who could it be?
[30:55.330 --> 30:56.930]  Like, we could still keep doing this or whatever.
[30:57.010 --> 31:00.890]  And it's just, I mean, you know, you could be feeding Gavin soup.
[31:01.430 --> 31:01.970]  Just saying.
[31:04.790 --> 31:06.110]  Andrew, where'd you get that gun from?
[31:07.510 --> 31:08.030]  Which gun?
[31:08.230 --> 31:08.810]  The gun I got.
[31:09.690 --> 31:12.290]  I accidentally picked the wrong gun and I stole Nick's.
[31:12.570 --> 31:13.450]  Oh my gosh.
[31:13.490 --> 31:14.450]  So I've got your gun.
[31:14.950 --> 31:15.830]  Yep, you got my gun.
[31:16.830 --> 31:18.570]  Are you going to have to go over and get something else?
[31:19.550 --> 31:21.130]  No, he's got like 300 bullets.
[31:22.330 --> 31:24.390]  Right, but if it, right, but it sucks, right?
[31:24.510 --> 31:26.050]  No, it's fine. It's just fully auto.
[31:26.490 --> 31:27.670]  That's just what those guys carry.
[31:27.970 --> 31:32.690]  I wish I could hit those dudes from here, but I can't.
[31:32.950 --> 31:33.510]  Reloading.
[31:33.650 --> 31:34.850]  Keep an eye, keep an eye.
[31:34.850 --> 31:36.470]  Some kind of a serious fence.
[31:38.610 --> 31:42.070]  They're, they're so slowly crawling into my view.
[31:44.510 --> 31:47.030]  My little cowards, keep around.
[31:50.460 --> 31:50.900]  Ow.
[31:53.440 --> 31:54.720]  Oh, he's eating the soup!
[31:55.040 --> 31:56.280]  I'm not there yet!
[31:56.980 --> 31:58.160]  He's eating the soup!
[31:59.520 --> 32:00.720]  I'm not there yet.
[32:07.170 --> 32:08.850]  We should do the reach holdout, right?
[32:10.470 --> 32:11.290]  What is that? Halo?
[32:11.730 --> 32:13.570]  Yeah, doesn't Halo have a...
[32:13.570 --> 32:15.550]  Never played Halo either.
[32:16.130 --> 32:17.350]  You've never played this still today.
[32:18.250 --> 32:19.110]  Never played Halo.
[32:19.930 --> 32:21.590]  No, I never, I was never a Halo guy.
[32:21.610 --> 32:22.590]  Let's put you in a lasso video.
[32:23.870 --> 32:24.810]  I'll do it.
[32:24.970 --> 32:25.770]  I'll do it too.
[32:25.830 --> 32:26.310]  I'll play lasso with you guys.
[32:27.090 --> 32:29.030]  Is that the one where it's like skulls or something?
[32:29.150 --> 32:30.470]  Legendary all skulls on.
[32:30.970 --> 32:31.330]  Oh.
[32:32.450 --> 32:33.910]  Is it like invisible guns?
[32:34.110 --> 32:34.810]  It's a nightmare.
[32:35.110 --> 32:36.310]  And the aliens fuck you and stuff?
[32:36.590 --> 32:36.850]  Yeah.
[32:36.850 --> 32:37.410]  Just like that stuff?
[32:37.950 --> 32:41.250]  I think being Halo 2 on lasso, one of the hardest things I've ever done.
[32:41.730 --> 32:42.170]  It's tough.
[32:42.770 --> 32:43.970]  That doesn't sound like fun at all.
[32:44.210 --> 32:44.710]  It's not.
[32:44.810 --> 32:45.230]  It's not fun.
[32:45.850 --> 32:47.070]  Oh, I'm out, I'm out completely.
[32:47.330 --> 32:47.790]  Zero bullets.
[32:48.090 --> 32:48.450]  What?
[32:49.170 --> 32:50.770]  How are you not keeping an eye on this?
[32:52.050 --> 32:53.610]  There's a lot of guns on the right.
[32:53.730 --> 32:54.810]  Go over to Andrew and get another gun.
[32:54.890 --> 32:56.050]  Yeah, go to Andrew, go to Andrew.
[32:56.270 --> 32:56.670]  There's guns.
[32:56.690 --> 32:57.930]  Alright, I'm keeping an eye over here.
[32:58.310 --> 32:59.290]  I'm holding it off.
[33:01.930 --> 33:03.550]  Yeah, watch out for grenades in that area.
[33:04.170 --> 33:04.690]  They're raining.
[33:05.530 --> 33:05.810]  Reloading.
[33:06.710 --> 33:07.510]  Geoff, you finding them?
[33:07.830 --> 33:08.850]  Uh, yeah, I'm good.
[33:08.930 --> 33:09.230]  We're good.
[33:10.450 --> 33:11.190]  They're queuing up.
[33:11.490 --> 33:14.350]  If they end up all at once, I'd be in a little bit of trouble, but I don't think they're
[33:14.350 --> 33:14.790]  going to do that.
[33:15.090 --> 33:15.530]  Andrew, are you leaving?
[33:15.530 --> 33:16.590]  It seems like you...
[33:16.590 --> 33:16.910]  Yeah.
[33:17.490 --> 33:17.690]  What?
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.950]  Did you not get it?
[33:18.990 --> 33:19.430]  What do you want?
[33:19.850 --> 33:21.030]  I think he wants you to cover him.
[33:21.350 --> 33:21.610]  Okay.
[33:23.750 --> 33:24.450]  Here they come, Geoff.
[33:24.470 --> 33:25.210]  One guy got past me.
[33:25.570 --> 33:25.710]  Alright.
[33:25.890 --> 33:26.390]  You got him.
[33:26.430 --> 33:28.210]  That was the easiest cover of all time.
[33:28.410 --> 33:29.270]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
[33:29.270 --> 33:29.930]  Alright.
[33:30.750 --> 33:31.110]  Wow!
[33:31.210 --> 33:32.650]  That guy made it to the...
[33:33.050 --> 33:33.410]  Yeah.
[33:33.690 --> 33:34.350]  ...frickin' place.
[33:34.530 --> 33:35.350]  It was a little scary.
[33:36.130 --> 33:37.150]  I'm going to have to reload in a second.
[33:37.470 --> 33:38.130]  That's a bunch of dice.
[33:38.150 --> 33:39.230]  Can you get me to properly swap?
[33:39.330 --> 33:39.690]  I can.
[33:39.750 --> 33:41.650]  I still have .305 and Nix.
[33:41.830 --> 33:42.630]  Alright, I'm reloading.
[33:43.090 --> 33:43.730]  In a full mag.
[33:45.770 --> 33:46.750]  Glad to be of service.
[33:49.950 --> 33:50.810]  Best thing you did.
[33:51.770 --> 33:52.450]  Alright, man, I'm right.
[33:53.470 --> 33:54.850]  I am actually alive.
[33:56.750 --> 33:57.430]  As a human.
[33:58.390 --> 33:59.530]  That's a human, yeah.
[34:01.430 --> 34:03.090]  Gavin, are you gonna come take your spot back or what?
[34:03.150 --> 34:04.490]  He's dealing with a problem.
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.150]  Yeah, yeah, this is like too much responsibility.
[34:06.270 --> 34:06.790]  Okay, hold on.
[34:07.410 --> 34:08.990]  Just need to clear my path a little.
[34:10.770 --> 34:11.950]  This gun is ass.
[34:12.750 --> 34:14.070]  Wow, that thing is inaccurate.
[34:14.710 --> 34:15.110]  Coming back.
[34:20.540 --> 34:21.180]  Going prone.
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.200]  Do we have to extract at the end of this too? Isn't that a thing?
[34:24.380 --> 34:25.020]  Nah, I don't think so.
[34:25.620 --> 34:27.000]  Oh, that was a different one we did.
[34:28.420 --> 34:28.740]  Maybe.
[34:28.740 --> 34:30.320]  There better not be an extract.
[34:34.940 --> 34:36.440]  That might have been a different game type.
[34:36.540 --> 34:37.100]  Come on.
[34:38.620 --> 34:39.460]  Oh, they're pushing.
[34:39.860 --> 34:41.100]  They're pushing their damn luck.
[34:41.200 --> 34:42.540]  Yeah, they're pushing a lot.
[34:42.580 --> 34:43.520]  I get little bursts of energy.
[34:43.780 --> 34:43.940]  Reloading!
[34:44.840 --> 34:46.160]  Watching like this left also.
[34:46.320 --> 34:46.740]  There they are.
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.540]  It's fun being able to watch with the drone.
[34:50.780 --> 34:51.000]  Yeah.
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.320]  Because there ain't nothing happening where I'm at, but I'm watching the little blips go down.
[34:54.780 --> 34:55.820]  How do you control the drone?
[34:56.380 --> 34:59.040]  We all can, but it's just in the top left for me.
[34:59.640 --> 35:01.640]  No, I mean, like, how do you control it?
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.840]  Geoff, how did you accidentally move the drone?
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.200]  With, uh...
[35:10.920 --> 35:13.980]  Honestly, Geoff, don't tell me.
[35:14.360 --> 35:16.920]  Whatever you're about to say, ain't no way it's right.
[35:17.880 --> 35:21.320]  It was Andrew nods for the question, and Geoff going, oh...
[35:21.320 --> 35:23.080]  I never did it, but he moved it.
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.440]  At least he didn't give me the wrong answer first this time.
[35:26.880 --> 35:28.540]  Andrew just went, I don't know.
[35:28.540 --> 35:29.920]  Here is someone who might know.
[35:30.200 --> 35:31.680]  At least that happened one time today.
[35:31.920 --> 35:32.920]  I'm pretty sure it was a D-pad.
[35:33.820 --> 35:35.240]  I just can't remember what they call a D-pad.
[35:35.460 --> 35:36.080]  What are you saying, Nick?
[35:36.640 --> 35:39.500]  You have 20 rounds. 18 rounds.
[35:40.000 --> 35:40.380]  Reloading.
[35:41.720 --> 35:42.480]  Directional pad.
[35:44.960 --> 35:45.900]  16, 15.
[35:46.880 --> 35:47.940]  Am I taking your spot back?
[35:48.680 --> 35:48.940]  Yeah.
[35:50.820 --> 35:51.480]  Or three.
[35:52.100 --> 35:52.440]  Okay, got it.
[35:52.560 --> 35:53.480]  He's moving. He didn't say anything.
[35:55.000 --> 35:55.580]  We got...
[35:55.580 --> 35:56.480]  I was behind him. I got him.
[35:56.480 --> 35:57.200]  We got Nick, the commentator.
[35:57.200 --> 35:57.760]  We're on the same page.
[35:57.860 --> 35:58.780]  Keep everyone informed.
[35:58.820 --> 35:59.220]  We're on the same page.
[35:59.760 --> 35:59.920]  Yeah.
[36:00.280 --> 36:01.960]  We haven't had anybody come over here in a while, Gavin.
[36:02.660 --> 36:02.900]  Okay.
[36:03.460 --> 36:04.180]  There's that one guy.
[36:04.480 --> 36:05.540]  There's a guy right there right now.
[36:05.720 --> 36:06.800]  That's the same gun you had.
[36:07.380 --> 36:08.700]  You just don't seem to pick up ammo.
[36:09.940 --> 36:10.260]  Gavin!
[36:10.420 --> 36:11.140]  There's a guy right there.
[36:11.600 --> 36:11.920]  Gavin!
[36:12.280 --> 36:12.600]  Gavin!
[36:16.160 --> 36:17.100]  What the fuck?
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.160]  How you doing, Gavin?
[36:21.920 --> 36:23.300]  I don't know why he did that.
[36:23.580 --> 36:24.520]  Hey, Gavin. Soup's on.
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.100]  I could see it happening.
[36:26.220 --> 36:27.300]  I'm like, there's a guy right there.
[36:28.060 --> 36:29.000]  He was prone.
[36:29.140 --> 36:29.860]  Oh, shit. I just went down.
[36:30.100 --> 36:30.540]  Fuck.
[36:30.780 --> 36:31.640]  Oh, shit.
[36:31.800 --> 36:32.040]  Okay.
[36:32.400 --> 36:33.580]  I'm in the Gavin spot.
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.200]  I just went down.
[36:35.040 --> 36:35.620]  That sucks.
[36:36.320 --> 36:36.540]  Yeah.
[36:36.660 --> 36:37.760]  Yeah, it's very bad.
[36:38.400 --> 36:39.360]  You got him, Andrew?
[36:39.580 --> 36:40.520]  I'm working on him.
[36:42.800 --> 36:43.460]  Thank you.
[36:43.600 --> 36:44.160]  Uh-oh.
[36:46.120 --> 36:47.320]  Gavin, where are you?
[36:47.900 --> 36:48.440]  He's dead.
[36:49.500 --> 36:50.720]  Oh, you died-died.
[36:50.940 --> 36:51.040]  Yeah.
[36:51.360 --> 36:51.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:52.280 --> 36:54.040]  He ran into the area.
[36:54.520 --> 36:57.080]  I thought you went down and everyone was giving you shit.
[36:57.220 --> 36:57.400]  No.
[36:57.500 --> 36:58.160]  Because you died.
[36:58.620 --> 37:00.520]  No, he fucking died-died.
[37:00.840 --> 37:02.940]  I saw a bunch of guns.
[37:03.640 --> 37:03.940]  Uh-huh.
[37:04.240 --> 37:06.300]  And there was way more people looking at me than I thought.
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.920]  How many people did you think were looking at you?
[37:09.020 --> 37:09.300]  One.
[37:09.660 --> 37:09.960]  Okay.
[37:10.880 --> 37:12.920]  How many people were looking at you?
[37:13.000 --> 37:13.640]  About nine.
[37:14.220 --> 37:16.100]  But also, it only took the one.
[37:16.800 --> 37:18.080]  Reloading, reloading, reloading.
[37:18.140 --> 37:19.020]  Anyway, soup's on, Gavin.
[37:20.060 --> 37:22.640]  This gets a little harder with three, but it's...
[37:22.640 --> 37:22.820]  Yep.
[37:23.780 --> 37:24.960]  It's still possible.
[37:25.420 --> 37:26.040]  Hey, man.
[37:26.120 --> 37:26.660]  It's okay.
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.160]  It's only been 20 minutes.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.900]  Hey, we're 40% of the way through, right?
[37:31.040 --> 37:33.340]  Or close to that, 30-something?
[37:34.060 --> 37:37.760]  I have about 200 bullets left.
[37:38.160 --> 37:38.560]  33%.
[37:39.780 --> 37:41.040]  Can I switch who I'm looking-
[37:41.040 --> 37:41.880]  Oh, there we go.
[37:42.860 --> 37:43.500]  Oh, Andrews.
[37:44.480 --> 37:45.520]  Is Andrew behind me?
[37:45.660 --> 37:45.880]  Yep.
[37:46.300 --> 37:47.200]  Okay, cool.
[37:47.740 --> 37:48.480]  I'll just stay prone.
[37:48.900 --> 37:49.180]  We're good.
[37:49.640 --> 37:52.120]  Because I feel like they're shooting at me, but not hitting me now.
[37:52.120 --> 37:54.840]  And I think it's because you're behind me, so you're drawing fire.
[37:55.260 --> 37:55.300]  Yep.
[37:55.580 --> 37:57.680]  That might actually be a really good move.
[37:57.960 --> 38:00.560]  It is until the person standing goes downy.
[38:02.160 --> 38:02.620]  What?
[38:02.880 --> 38:03.800]  I got shot there.
[38:04.700 --> 38:06.920]  Were you standing or were you crouching?
[38:07.200 --> 38:07.960]  I was crouching.
[38:08.900 --> 38:10.820]  And that's where you got killed, was behind Gavin?
[38:11.060 --> 38:12.500]  No, I got downed there.
[38:13.440 --> 38:14.330]  That's where I got downed.
[38:15.020 --> 38:15.620]  And then I died.
[38:16.080 --> 38:16.220]  Oh.
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.720]  Did you get blown up?
[38:18.300 --> 38:18.720]  Yeah, I did.
[38:19.200 --> 38:19.440]  Oh.
[38:20.080 --> 38:20.720]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[38:20.780 --> 38:22.280]  You're talking about the first time you went...
[38:22.280 --> 38:22.800]  Okay, I see.
[38:23.380 --> 38:23.760]  No, no, no.
[38:23.780 --> 38:27.000]  I just got downed, and then Andrew got me up, and then I went to help Andrew, and I died.
[38:27.120 --> 38:27.620]  Oh, no, yeah.
[38:28.880 --> 38:29.360]  That's true.
[38:29.580 --> 38:29.960]  You went to help...
[38:29.960 --> 38:31.360]  You keep saying went to help Andrew.
[38:31.600 --> 38:32.260]  I went to help Andrew.
[38:32.860 --> 38:35.520]  And then when we asked Andrew if he needed help, he went...
[38:35.520 --> 38:37.420]  I didn't know Nick was over here until he died.
[38:37.420 --> 38:37.980]  Right, but here...
[38:37.980 --> 38:39.020]  He's like, I went to help Andrew.
[38:39.040 --> 38:41.700]  He's working on getting that medic achievement where you have to pick people up.
[38:42.040 --> 38:42.200]  Right.
[38:43.080 --> 38:43.760]  Listen, here's the thing.
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.960]  You can offer people help without them actually needing it yet.
[38:47.180 --> 38:49.180]  A stranger's just a friend you haven't met, Andrew.
[38:49.180 --> 38:50.240]  Or Gavin, Eric, whatever.
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.140]  Your fucking name is.
[38:51.240 --> 38:51.620]  You know the rest.
[38:57.340 --> 39:01.140]  This is going to get real stressful real quick as we deplete AML.
[39:01.760 --> 39:02.940]  That's where I'm at.
[39:03.200 --> 39:06.060]  I'm just out at about 100 bullets now.
[39:06.360 --> 39:08.060]  Okay, I got 290.
[39:09.060 --> 39:10.480]  These guys are getting real close.
[39:12.960 --> 39:14.540]  Where are the nearest guns?
[39:15.260 --> 39:16.200]  I don't even know where I can grab...
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.920]  Aren't there some by Geoff?
[39:18.360 --> 39:19.260]  No, I don't think so.
[39:19.320 --> 39:20.320]  No, they're pretty far up, man.
[39:20.400 --> 39:22.260]  I thought you killed a couple people over there, didn't you?
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.280]  You might have to swap your pistol and bip as they get close.
[39:25.840 --> 39:26.100]  Okay.
[39:27.240 --> 39:28.060]  The pistol wasn't bad.
[39:28.120 --> 39:32.800]  I can run over probably to the entrance on the left side.
[39:33.040 --> 39:34.020]  Here, do you want me...
[39:34.020 --> 39:34.880]  How much ammo do you have?
[39:36.820 --> 39:37.940]  130, something like that.
[39:37.980 --> 39:41.000]  Okay, I'm going to start moving to the flank to see if I can maybe...
[39:41.800 --> 39:42.520]  I don't need to.
[39:43.100 --> 39:43.580]  It's fine.
[39:43.620 --> 39:44.840]  We'll figure it out when we figure it out.
[39:44.840 --> 39:47.800]  I'm not worried about it, especially in this run.
[39:49.260 --> 39:52.580]  Because I think it'll be a good experiment on how far we can go out there.
[39:52.800 --> 39:53.940]  Geoff, that guy can see you.
[39:53.940 --> 39:54.600]  It really starts getting hairy.
[39:55.120 --> 39:56.720]  He's about to see this.
[39:58.340 --> 39:59.400]  Is Geoff throwing grenades?
[39:59.580 --> 40:00.280]  Yeah, he sure is.
[40:02.420 --> 40:04.440]  Oh no, I didn't mean to throw two grenades.
[40:09.020 --> 40:11.260]  Those didn't sound like they were near the bad guys.
[40:13.720 --> 40:14.160]  Uh...
[40:14.700 --> 40:16.320]  It's about sending a message.
[40:17.140 --> 40:17.580]  Okay.
[40:17.800 --> 40:18.280]  It was loud.
[40:18.580 --> 40:19.860]  This is the kind of firepower we have.
[40:19.920 --> 40:20.460]  Shock and awe.
[40:23.200 --> 40:24.460]  What button is it for grenades?
[40:25.200 --> 40:25.880]  Hold B.
[40:26.580 --> 40:26.800]  Okay.
[40:26.960 --> 40:28.480]  Oh, it brings up your ridicule thing?
[40:28.640 --> 40:28.820]  Yeah.
[40:31.840 --> 40:32.280]  Reloading.
[40:32.460 --> 40:32.660]  Okay.
[40:34.220 --> 40:35.360]  Okay, I'm down to 87.
[40:37.700 --> 40:38.140]  Dead.
[40:38.780 --> 40:39.140]  Dead.
[40:39.140 --> 40:41.420]  You're down?
[40:41.900 --> 40:42.180]  Dead, dead.
[40:42.280 --> 40:43.240]  Yeah, you can take my gun.
[40:43.560 --> 40:45.600]  It needs reloading, but...
[40:45.600 --> 40:45.800]  Okay.
[40:46.080 --> 40:46.580]  Thank you.
[40:48.040 --> 40:49.280]  So it's just me and Geoff?
[40:49.540 --> 40:49.740]  Yep.
[40:49.740 --> 40:51.020]  Sounds like it's just us, buddy.
[40:53.160 --> 40:56.480]  Geoff's slowly moving out further from cover.
[40:57.240 --> 40:59.520]  I gotta get where the action is and help Eric out.
[41:08.940 --> 41:10.360]  Are you trying to roll, Geoff?
[41:10.540 --> 41:11.940]  No, I'm trying to back up to where Eric is.
[41:11.940 --> 41:12.700]  What's the roll?
[41:12.780 --> 41:14.040]  I want to know what the roll button is.
[41:14.040 --> 41:16.500]  It keeps telling me that I can roll, but I don't know what the roll button is.
[41:25.280 --> 41:27.880]  Oh, you're doing pretty good, Eric.
[41:28.680 --> 41:29.060]  Thank you.
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.540]  I like shooters.
[41:33.320 --> 41:34.240]  You're gonna love Halo.
[41:34.800 --> 41:35.060]  Yeah.
[41:36.940 --> 41:38.960]  Geoff has so much ammo, that's great.
[41:41.080 --> 41:41.960]  30 bullets.
[41:42.320 --> 41:42.940]  30 bullets.
[41:43.980 --> 41:44.420]  Gonna...
[41:44.420 --> 41:46.840]  As soon as I run out of this, I'll call it out.
[41:46.840 --> 41:50.580]  I'm gonna unprone, or I guess just move backwards and see if I can grab Andrew's gun.
[41:52.820 --> 41:53.220]  24.
[41:56.020 --> 41:56.420]  18.
[41:58.440 --> 41:58.840]  14.
[41:59.260 --> 42:00.880]  Okay, well Geoff is dead.
[42:01.740 --> 42:01.940]  What?
[42:02.040 --> 42:02.460]  I got bit.
[42:02.620 --> 42:03.260]  I just got sniped.
[42:03.480 --> 42:04.260]  Oh, fuck.
[42:04.900 --> 42:05.580]  They're coming in.
[42:06.680 --> 42:07.500]  Hey, you rolled.
[42:08.020 --> 42:09.080]  I learned how to roll, guys.
[42:09.100 --> 42:09.700]  Hell yeah.
[42:10.700 --> 42:11.340]  What's the roll button?
[42:11.880 --> 42:12.880]  Oh, they're taking the zone.
[42:13.380 --> 42:13.420]  Where's your gun?
[42:14.000 --> 42:14.680]  Where's your gun?
[42:14.740 --> 42:15.420]  I don't know.
[42:16.160 --> 42:16.980]  There's no gun.
[42:17.320 --> 42:17.940]  There's no gun.
[42:20.020 --> 42:21.380]  Guys, we almost made it halfway.
[42:21.640 --> 42:21.980]  35 minutes.
[42:22.000 --> 42:22.200]  We were close.
[42:22.540 --> 42:23.640]  I think that was a pretty good job.
[42:23.720 --> 42:25.460]  I think we should save it for a live stream.
[42:25.760 --> 42:26.600]  Should we wrap this up?
[42:26.720 --> 42:27.240]  Yeah, let's do it.
[42:27.300 --> 42:27.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.180]  That was a great test, though.
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.020]  It was a great test.
[42:30.020 --> 42:30.720]  Good job, Gavin.
[42:30.900 --> 42:32.300]  We know it works.
[42:32.580 --> 42:33.280]  Great thinking.
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.000]  Maybe on the live stream, Nick will hit the 10-minute mark.
[42:37.880 --> 42:38.480]  Puzzle goals.
[42:38.880 --> 42:39.460]  Here's the thing.
[42:39.520 --> 42:40.380]  I don't want to push them.
[42:40.720 --> 42:41.320]  You know what I mean?
[42:44.040 --> 42:44.360]  So...
[42:47.100 --> 42:47.740]  All right.
[42:47.880 --> 42:49.220]  Thanks for watching this video.
[42:49.420 --> 42:51.600]  Did it come out as a regular video or is it on Patreon?
[42:51.820 --> 42:52.920]  Either way, thank you so much.
[42:53.720 --> 42:56.420]  Tune in for a live stream where...
[42:57.560 --> 42:58.360]  We do it!
[42:58.780 --> 42:59.080]  Yeah.
[42:59.780 --> 43:00.240]  When's that?
[43:02.020 --> 43:04.420]  It would be on a Friday at 4 p.m. Central.
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.140]  That's when we want to do it?
[43:06.320 --> 43:07.700]  I was thinking it was like a Falcon.
[43:07.800 --> 43:09.300]  You want to just do it on Twitch?
[43:09.420 --> 43:10.940]  Yeah, I just figured we'd just do it on Twitch.
[43:11.260 --> 43:12.120]  You're crazy.
[43:12.120 --> 43:13.400]  Why wouldn't we just do it on Twitch?
[43:14.160 --> 43:19.560]  We have the unspecified future when we do it on Twitch or for Falcons.
[43:19.660 --> 43:20.220]  Who knows?
[43:20.620 --> 43:23.880]  Or maybe we've already done it as a stream and you're watching this video later going,
[43:23.980 --> 43:24.400]  They're idiots.
[43:24.780 --> 43:25.520]  Jesus Christ.
[43:25.780 --> 43:26.000]  All right.
[43:26.060 --> 43:26.820]  We'll see you next time.
[43:26.900 --> 43:27.040]  Bye.
[43:27.240 --> 43:27.380]  Bye.
