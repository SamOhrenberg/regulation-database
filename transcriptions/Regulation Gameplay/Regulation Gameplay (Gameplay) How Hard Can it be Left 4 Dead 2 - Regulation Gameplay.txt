[00:00.000 --> 00:02.260]  Oh my god, it's Left 4 Dead 2!
[00:02.520 --> 00:03.240]  Oh shit!
[00:03.420 --> 00:05.380]  We're here with a regular gameplay. How's it going everybody?
[00:05.740 --> 00:05.880]  Hello!
[00:06.040 --> 00:10.960]  It's going really well. We've been talking about playing this for a long time. I'm glad we're finally doing it.
[00:11.160 --> 00:12.160]  I'm so excited!
[00:12.180 --> 00:15.300]  Andrew, when was the last time you played Left 4 Dead? Can you remember?
[00:15.640 --> 00:19.480]  Uh, when we made an achievement on our video.
[00:19.620 --> 00:20.080]  Oh my god!
[00:20.080 --> 00:21.720]  In like 2015?
[00:22.860 --> 00:23.100]  Wow.
[00:23.400 --> 00:23.660]  Yeah.
[00:24.220 --> 00:25.520]  We did a hot seat in it?
[00:25.540 --> 00:26.460]  Was I in that video?
[00:26.860 --> 00:30.140]  You were. It was Gavin and you and Caleb.
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.980]  That's probably the last time I played this game as well.
[00:34.040 --> 00:35.360]  It's gotta be the last time I played.
[00:35.900 --> 00:38.680]  I currently have it set to advance.
[00:38.960 --> 00:39.600]  Yeah, let's do it.
[00:39.800 --> 00:44.800]  We finally have a business that can pay for stuff and we were able to buy the game that we want to play. It's very exciting.
[00:46.440 --> 00:49.600]  Alyssa got her parents to mail her this copy of Left 4 Dead.
[00:49.900 --> 00:50.300]  Wow!
[00:50.680 --> 00:52.020]  And then she let me borrow it.
[00:52.400 --> 00:55.260]  But she did say I had to play as Alice, so I'm doing that in her honor.
[00:55.260 --> 01:00.960]  I had it in my head that I could just go into any used game store in the world and buy multiple copies of this.
[01:01.120 --> 01:04.160]  So I was like, don't worry guys, I'll just find them for us.
[01:04.780 --> 01:07.520]  It turns out that's not the case. This is a hard to fucking find game.
[01:07.840 --> 01:08.680]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:09.160 --> 01:13.220]  I had a digital copy the whole time, but I could not find it locally or in Michigan when I tried.
[01:13.460 --> 01:14.220]  Come back!
[01:14.400 --> 01:15.520]  Come back!
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.120]  Such a great... Ugh, I love this game!
[01:19.700 --> 01:21.420]  Why did they stop making it?
[01:21.840 --> 01:23.640]  We couldn't play on PC.
[01:24.300 --> 01:24.760]  Sure, we could.
[01:25.220 --> 01:25.540]  Oh.
[01:26.580 --> 01:27.480]  Yeah, I have it on PC.
[01:28.240 --> 01:29.520]  You know Andrew's not a PC guy.
[01:30.240 --> 01:30.420]  Yeah.
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.800]  Yeah, have you seen the way he organizes his desktop?
[01:34.960 --> 01:36.580]  We gotta stay together to survive, everybody.
[01:36.980 --> 01:37.300]  Okay.
[01:37.580 --> 01:38.980]  Should I open this door? Like this?
[01:39.360 --> 01:39.600]  Yeah.
[01:40.660 --> 01:41.880]  How do I crouch?
[01:42.440 --> 01:42.960]  Is there a crouch?
[01:43.120 --> 01:44.060]  Okay, it's left bumper.
[01:44.680 --> 01:45.680]  Oh, the motion blur.
[01:46.200 --> 01:46.540]  Look at all that.
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.020]  Oh, do we need to turn it off?
[01:50.240 --> 01:51.480]  I don't know if you can.
[01:51.680 --> 01:52.520]  Yeah, I don't know if you can.
[01:53.900 --> 01:54.300]  What?
[01:55.440 --> 01:57.800]  Man, I don't remember the screen getting so bloody.
[01:58.880 --> 01:59.440]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00.040 --> 02:01.080]  It gets gory.
[02:01.080 --> 02:02.520]  It's just been a really long time.
[02:03.920 --> 02:04.160]  Wow.
[02:04.380 --> 02:06.020]  A magnum in here if you want a magnum.
[02:07.520 --> 02:07.980]  Conference room.
[02:09.340 --> 02:10.880]  Ah, get off me, you wanker.
[02:10.880 --> 02:11.340]  Excuse me.
[02:11.820 --> 02:12.020]  Pardon.
[02:13.440 --> 02:14.360]  Ooh, pills here.
[02:15.400 --> 02:15.580]  What?
[02:15.940 --> 02:17.120]  Oh, get away, get away, get away!
[02:18.320 --> 02:19.540]  Ow, you son of a bitch!
[02:20.480 --> 02:21.300]  The melee weapons?
[02:21.500 --> 02:22.400]  Geoff, you shot me!
[02:22.400 --> 02:23.440]  I know, it sucks.
[02:24.840 --> 02:26.820]  You hold them and you swing them.
[02:27.040 --> 02:29.020]  Is there a benefit to using those other guns?
[02:30.200 --> 02:30.700]  No ammo.
[02:32.000 --> 02:32.960]  Yeah, you don't run out.
[02:33.060 --> 02:35.300]  You get tired after a time and you slow down.
[02:35.720 --> 02:35.980]  Okay.
[02:36.580 --> 02:39.760]  But you can do the old left trigger.
[02:41.220 --> 02:46.200]  But if you, like CJ, you can go work out in the gym and get stronger and then you have more...
[02:46.200 --> 02:46.440]  Got him.
[02:46.660 --> 02:47.840]  Oh, oh, oh no, oh no.
[02:47.980 --> 02:48.240]  Nice.
[02:48.720 --> 02:51.280]  Don't forget, left trigger is melee if you're holding a gun.
[02:51.280 --> 02:52.200]  This way, fellas.
[02:53.240 --> 02:53.620]  One sec.
[02:54.220 --> 02:55.280]  Protect me, exploded barrel.
[02:55.360 --> 02:56.960]  I need to change the setting, protect me for a minute.
[02:57.020 --> 02:57.900]  What setting are you changing?
[02:59.240 --> 03:03.080]  I have the full captions on, I'm gonna turn those off.
[03:03.200 --> 03:05.820]  Oh, but that's useful for the special infected coming up.
[03:06.020 --> 03:06.640]  Yeah, it is.
[03:06.800 --> 03:07.640]  But I feel like I'm cheating.
[03:08.220 --> 03:09.000]  Oh, oh, oh!
[03:09.800 --> 03:10.900]  Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him!
[03:12.780 --> 03:13.340]  Nice shot.
[03:13.360 --> 03:13.700]  Okay, we're good.
[03:13.800 --> 03:14.380]  Alright, good deal.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.460]  Oh, got it.
[03:18.460 --> 03:19.720]  Grabbing a shot.
[03:20.400 --> 03:21.100]  Excuse me.
[03:21.120 --> 03:21.560]  Pills.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  How'd you get up here, you crazy bastards?
[03:25.240 --> 03:26.120]  Fax machine here.
[03:26.280 --> 03:26.720]  Reloading.
[03:28.360 --> 03:28.900]  Anybody know?
[03:28.900 --> 03:29.580]  Axe machine?
[03:29.840 --> 03:30.360]  No, alright.
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.820]  Anybody got any documents you need to send out?
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.000]  Oh.
[03:33.140 --> 03:33.780]  Before the world ends?
[03:33.840 --> 03:34.400]  File bomb.
[03:35.500 --> 03:36.780]  Oh, you said fax machine.
[03:36.980 --> 03:37.220]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[03:37.240 --> 03:40.700]  The lines are still gonna be up, it's still pretty fresh.
[03:41.820 --> 03:43.720]  I thought you said axe machine.
[03:43.820 --> 03:44.940]  No, no, no, no.
[03:45.040 --> 03:46.420]  I was very excited about that.
[03:46.420 --> 03:47.060]  I'm terrified.
[03:47.060 --> 03:48.320]  Oh, charger!
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.460]  Charger up on the building!
[03:50.580 --> 03:50.760]  Thank you!
[03:51.420 --> 03:51.780]  Where?
[03:52.540 --> 03:52.960]  Got him.
[03:53.040 --> 03:53.920]  Hey, pills over here!
[03:54.180 --> 03:54.680]  Ward! Ward!
[03:55.320 --> 03:55.740]  I'm throwing!
[03:57.280 --> 03:57.640]  Puke!
[03:59.380 --> 03:59.740]  Puke?
[04:00.280 --> 04:00.980]  Oh, that's right.
[04:01.220 --> 04:01.960]  The file bomb.
[04:02.120 --> 04:02.940]  I forgot about the bomb.
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.320]  Does adrenaline heal, or does it just give you temporary health?
[04:06.420 --> 04:08.900]  It gives you a little bit of health and speed.
[04:09.400 --> 04:10.360]  Oh yeah, I'm doing it.
[04:10.440 --> 04:10.920]  I'm using it.
[04:12.140 --> 04:12.760]  You're using it?
[04:12.820 --> 04:13.840]  What do you mean?
[04:14.300 --> 04:14.600]  What?
[04:16.400 --> 04:17.180]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[04:17.860 --> 04:18.480]  What do you mean?
[04:18.720 --> 04:19.140]  What do you mean?
[04:19.260 --> 04:19.660]  What does he mean?
[04:20.520 --> 04:20.900]  What do you mean?
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.060]  It's a wild time to use it.
[04:23.060 --> 04:23.980]  I assume you'll find more.
[04:24.120 --> 04:24.940]  It's not rare, is it?
[04:26.320 --> 04:26.620]  Uh...
[04:26.620 --> 04:27.560]  It's probably rare.
[04:28.040 --> 04:28.940]  Probably not a normal.
[04:29.020 --> 04:29.440]  Yeah, we went down.
[04:31.300 --> 04:31.600]  Ooh!
[04:32.800 --> 04:33.440]  Uh-oh, hunter!
[04:33.820 --> 04:34.120]  Hunter! Hunter!
[04:34.240 --> 04:34.700]  I got you!
[04:35.080 --> 04:35.580]  I got you!
[04:36.180 --> 04:38.140]  Man, if I didn't have adrenaline, I might have died there.
[04:39.020 --> 04:40.220]  Ooh, a chainsaw!
[04:40.240 --> 04:41.300]  You're gonna die very soon after.
[04:41.580 --> 04:41.880]  Sorry, Gavin.
[04:43.080 --> 04:43.640]  Gavin's hurt.
[04:43.640 --> 04:44.440]  Where's the pipe bomb?
[04:45.160 --> 04:46.040]  I'm getting messed up.
[04:48.800 --> 04:49.040]  Oh!
[04:49.200 --> 04:49.400]  Oh!
[04:50.080 --> 04:50.400]  Elevator!
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.320]  Get away!
[04:51.460 --> 04:51.720]  Get away!
[04:51.800 --> 04:51.980]  Get away!
[04:53.120 --> 04:53.620]  Thanks, Gavin.
[04:54.520 --> 04:55.440]  Fucking get back!
[04:56.260 --> 04:56.860]  Hey, what's up?
[04:57.360 --> 04:58.180]  Hey, Gavin, we're pretty hurt.
[04:58.600 --> 04:59.160]  Oh, what the?
[04:59.280 --> 05:00.100]  Are we not supposed to be in here?
[05:00.160 --> 05:00.360]  Uh-oh.
[05:01.100 --> 05:01.540]  No, we are.
[05:01.600 --> 05:03.240]  I'm just seeing if there's any items or anything.
[05:03.860 --> 05:04.980]  They're still far behind.
[05:05.040 --> 05:05.580]  What's the...
[05:05.580 --> 05:06.640]  Oh, there's a wild bee.
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.920]  This game is milkier than I remember.
[05:09.600 --> 05:10.100]  Oh, shit.
[05:10.600 --> 05:12.060]  Well, these are milkier times, dude.
[05:12.060 --> 05:12.960]  Pain pills.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.280]  Did you crash out?
[05:16.380 --> 05:16.820]  Is Nick...
[05:16.820 --> 05:17.040]  Hey, Nick?
[05:17.140 --> 05:17.700]  Did Nick leave?
[05:18.360 --> 05:18.780]  Nick?
[05:19.900 --> 05:20.380]  Nick?
[05:20.520 --> 05:20.920]  Nick?
[05:21.060 --> 05:21.540]  Nick?
[05:21.760 --> 05:22.700]  Nick, are you playing?
[05:23.180 --> 05:23.960]  Oh, shit.
[05:24.320 --> 05:24.640]  Gavin!
[05:25.040 --> 05:26.340]  His stream ended.
[05:26.760 --> 05:28.540]  I was watching it, and then...
[05:29.800 --> 05:30.960]  Nick's just standing still.
[05:31.160 --> 05:31.460]  Charger!
[05:31.660 --> 05:31.960]  Charger!
[05:32.120 --> 05:32.400]  Charger!
[05:32.500 --> 05:32.740]  Charger!
[05:32.740 --> 05:32.940]  Charger!
[05:33.160 --> 05:34.240]  I gotta get Gavin up.
[05:34.700 --> 05:36.380]  Nick may have lost power or something.
[05:37.060 --> 05:38.140]  He's typed something, I think.
[05:38.540 --> 05:39.060]  What has he typed?
[05:40.140 --> 05:40.600]  I don't...
[05:40.600 --> 05:41.320]  Oh, he's no idle!
[05:41.720 --> 05:42.940]  I don't see him typing anything.
[05:43.320 --> 05:44.340]  Oh, I just heard Discord go boop.
[05:44.340 --> 05:44.620]  He's here.
[05:44.660 --> 05:44.940]  He's here.
[05:45.000 --> 05:45.280]  He's here.
[05:46.340 --> 05:47.060]  Well, he's idle.
[05:47.260 --> 05:47.600]  It's AI.
[05:47.960 --> 05:48.060]  Oh.
[05:48.360 --> 05:49.380]  His AI is kicking ass.
[05:49.760 --> 05:50.860]  His AI is healing me.
[05:50.940 --> 05:51.280]  Sorry, Nick.
[05:52.060 --> 05:53.120]  I think this is helpful.
[05:55.680 --> 05:56.640]  Thanks, AI, Nick.
[05:59.540 --> 06:01.060]  Oh, Nick has left the game.
[06:01.860 --> 06:02.560]  Let's go ahead and...
[06:02.560 --> 06:03.340]  Now, do I get in here?
[06:03.460 --> 06:04.880]  Go to the bed, do I assume?
[06:05.220 --> 06:05.660]  I assume.
[06:05.800 --> 06:06.680]  I got bad news, guys.
[06:07.520 --> 06:08.920]  One of us is the devil.
[06:17.760 --> 06:18.360]  You know what?
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.260]  I'm gonna fucking beat you guys to the elevator.
[06:20.500 --> 06:21.400]  That's what I'm gonna do.
[06:22.580 --> 06:23.440]  Get out of my way!
[06:24.520 --> 06:24.840]  Zombies!
[06:25.280 --> 06:25.820]  Get out of my way!
[06:26.100 --> 06:26.240]  Doing great.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.460]  I got an elevator to catch!
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.340]  Are you just running to the elevator?
[06:29.360 --> 06:29.660]  Go, go, go!
[06:30.420 --> 06:30.940]  I'm going!
[06:31.000 --> 06:31.520]  I guess that works.
[06:31.520 --> 06:32.100]  Let's do it.
[06:32.640 --> 06:32.960]  Sure.
[06:33.080 --> 06:33.300]  Let's do it.
[06:33.340 --> 06:33.560]  Full balls!
[06:33.760 --> 06:33.900]  Sprinting!
[06:35.520 --> 06:36.020]  Why not?
[06:36.040 --> 06:36.860]  I'm gonna beat you guys.
[06:38.360 --> 06:38.960]  Keep going.
[06:39.220 --> 06:40.800]  Now that we've done this once...
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.380]  Oh, I know the way.
[06:41.380 --> 06:43.500]  Go ahead and shoot Andrew in the leg, if you could.
[06:44.120 --> 06:45.860]  Oh, I almost ran off the ledge.
[06:46.000 --> 06:46.700]  Don't do that.
[06:47.180 --> 06:47.780]  Oh shit!
[06:47.780 --> 06:48.480]  No, you will die.
[06:48.620 --> 06:49.980]  Geoff, you almost pushed me off the ledge.
[06:50.080 --> 06:50.680]  Don't do that.
[06:53.040 --> 06:53.480]  Woo!
[06:53.880 --> 06:54.320]  Andrew!
[06:55.180 --> 06:55.620]  Running!
[06:58.640 --> 07:00.300]  Why'd you shut the door, Andrew?
[07:00.860 --> 07:02.040]  Andrew, you dickwagon!
[07:02.220 --> 07:03.160]  So the zombies couldn't chase me!
[07:04.220 --> 07:05.720]  You son of a bitch.
[07:06.660 --> 07:06.900]  Pills!
[07:08.480 --> 07:09.420]  This is pretty efficient.
[07:09.500 --> 07:10.080]  I hear a boomer.
[07:10.940 --> 07:11.120]  Yeah.
[07:12.480 --> 07:13.600]  But does he hear you?
[07:14.700 --> 07:16.560]  Geoff, your arm was tripping out.
[07:16.820 --> 07:17.360]  Thanks, man.
[07:17.420 --> 07:17.880]  There we go.
[07:18.280 --> 07:19.340]  Wow, look at that, guys.
[07:20.200 --> 07:21.100]  That was really good.
[07:21.120 --> 07:21.960]  Look at the zombie go.
[07:22.860 --> 07:23.940]  Is that on your screen, too?
[07:24.420 --> 07:24.660]  Yep.
[07:25.400 --> 07:26.920]  The zombie had his leg stuck in the door.
[07:27.720 --> 07:29.260]  Gavin forgot his health pack.
[07:29.660 --> 07:29.920]  Ooh.
[07:30.660 --> 07:30.980]  Gavin!
[07:31.620 --> 07:31.660]  Nice.
[07:32.300 --> 07:33.340]  Way to go, dude.
[07:33.580 --> 07:34.640]  It's okay, we're just on advance.
[07:34.740 --> 07:35.180]  It's not expert.
[07:35.740 --> 07:36.280]  Oh, yeah.
[07:36.400 --> 07:37.040]  Where's your health pack?
[07:37.280 --> 07:37.900]  Where's your health pack?
[07:38.180 --> 07:39.340]  What's the flashlight button?
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.380]  Oh, there it is.
[07:40.900 --> 07:42.220]  Up on the D-pad.
[07:42.320 --> 07:43.040]  You guys swimming in milk?
[07:43.920 --> 07:44.640]  It's milky.
[07:44.840 --> 07:45.680]  It's smoky milk.
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.360]  Probably the door's open.
[07:48.780 --> 07:49.500]  Oh, balls.
[07:50.260 --> 07:51.300]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[07:51.580 --> 07:52.660]  Andrew has alerted the Horde.
[07:53.500 --> 07:54.000]  Sure have.
[07:54.020 --> 07:54.160]  Shit.
[07:55.340 --> 07:56.220]  Don't run in front!
[07:57.080 --> 07:57.440]  Ow!
[07:58.020 --> 07:59.140]  Shall I use the pipe bomb?
[08:00.380 --> 08:00.840]  Uh, sure.
[08:00.880 --> 08:01.200]  Uh, sure.
[08:01.960 --> 08:02.640]  How do you do it?
[08:03.900 --> 08:04.900]  Left on the D-pad.
[08:05.140 --> 08:05.620]  I don't think I have it.
[08:05.620 --> 08:05.980]  Throwing it.
[08:06.680 --> 08:07.940]  Oh, shit, I bounced off someone.
[08:08.000 --> 08:08.580]  Oh, that's you guys.
[08:10.120 --> 08:11.300]  Uh, health pack in here.
[08:11.760 --> 08:12.600]  To the right, Gavin.
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.780]  Pick one up.
[08:15.280 --> 08:16.140]  Can you mark it?
[08:16.300 --> 08:16.760]  Where was it?
[08:17.640 --> 08:18.580]  Oh, yeah, can you mark things?
[08:18.600 --> 08:19.400]  Just come to where we're at.
[08:19.500 --> 08:19.620]  Alright.
[08:19.620 --> 08:20.200]  You can see us.
[08:20.580 --> 08:21.220]  We're the markers.
[08:21.600 --> 08:21.720]  Oh, yeah.
[08:21.720 --> 08:22.900]  You can't ping things, can you?
[08:23.680 --> 08:24.800]  Oh, probably not in this game.
[08:25.140 --> 08:25.960]  No, it's too old.
[08:26.100 --> 08:26.820]  I don't think so.
[08:27.000 --> 08:27.140]  Yeah.
[08:27.160 --> 08:28.800]  I think you just walk up to it and they go like,
[08:28.880 --> 08:29.240]  Pills here.
[08:29.240 --> 08:29.660]  Oh, charger.
[08:30.240 --> 08:30.560]  Charger.
[08:30.960 --> 08:32.320]  Oh, shit.
[08:32.720 --> 08:33.300]  He definitely was.
[08:33.300 --> 08:33.660]  I got it.
[08:34.500 --> 08:35.000]  Nice, Nick.
[08:35.740 --> 08:36.100]  There you go.
[08:36.620 --> 08:37.140]  Through the flames.
[08:37.400 --> 08:37.460]  Good job.
[08:38.080 --> 08:38.800]  Oh, hot potato.
[08:39.860 --> 08:40.180]  Woo!
[08:40.300 --> 08:41.520]  I think if you're first in a doorway,
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.360]  you should probably crouch.
[08:42.740 --> 08:43.500]  Oh, shh.
[08:43.780 --> 08:44.640]  That's just my guess.
[08:45.320 --> 08:45.680]  You know what?
[08:45.740 --> 08:46.100]  Good call.
[08:46.620 --> 08:47.420]  What does crouching do?
[08:48.140 --> 08:49.180]  It keeps you from getting shot.
[08:49.620 --> 08:49.800]  Jockey!
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.180]  I got you.
[08:50.220 --> 08:50.560]  I got you.
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.500]  How much is the friendly fire in this game?
[08:56.980 --> 08:57.560]  Pretty bad.
[08:58.000 --> 08:58.900]  Pretty, pretty bad.
[08:59.000 --> 08:59.380]  Pretty bad on this difficulty.
[08:59.380 --> 08:59.840]  And there's some pills here.
[09:00.600 --> 09:00.860]  Gotcha.
[09:02.080 --> 09:02.480]  Pills.
[09:04.240 --> 09:05.040]  Get away from me.
[09:05.060 --> 09:06.340]  Andrew and Geoff could probably use them.
[09:07.180 --> 09:07.980]  I got some already.
[09:09.440 --> 09:10.340]  Trying to clear the path.
[09:11.880 --> 09:12.680]  Oh, shit.
[09:12.680 --> 09:14.080]  I think I just dropped them.
[09:14.140 --> 09:14.660]  Oh, I'm hitting a lot of people in my ass.
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.900]  I think I used pills by accident.
[09:16.060 --> 09:17.200]  You took my pills and used them.
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.640]  I think you put them in my hand and I stuffed them down my throat with 97% health.
[09:22.580 --> 09:23.140]  Sorry, Geoff.
[09:24.860 --> 09:26.520]  Pipe bomb over here if anyone wants it.
[09:30.380 --> 09:30.540]  Oh.
[09:30.620 --> 09:31.220]  Yay, yay, yay.
[09:31.860 --> 09:32.180]  Ow!
[09:32.460 --> 09:32.760]  Okay.
[09:33.200 --> 09:34.120]  Fuck it, I'll just go over here.
[09:34.820 --> 09:35.180]  Shit.
[09:35.800 --> 09:36.680]  Wow, I made it, Andrew.
[09:36.880 --> 09:36.960]  Sorry.
[09:38.060 --> 09:38.780]  Easy peasy.
[09:39.120 --> 09:39.860]  Oh, hell yeah.
[09:40.660 --> 09:41.020]  We did it.
[09:41.440 --> 09:41.800]  Woo!
[09:42.220 --> 09:42.480]  Woo!
[09:43.580 --> 09:46.240]  Oh, they should make Left 4 Dead 3.
[09:46.380 --> 09:47.240]  Come on, suds.
[09:47.400 --> 09:47.600]  I know.
[09:47.620 --> 09:51.880]  It was just as much fun today as it was 100 years ago when we played it.
[09:52.360 --> 09:54.320]  I never played the Back 4 Blood.
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.180]  Was that any good?
[09:55.680 --> 09:55.840]  No.
[09:55.940 --> 09:56.120]  No.
[09:56.440 --> 09:56.800]  No.
[09:56.960 --> 09:57.300]  I tried.
[09:57.860 --> 09:58.960]  How did they mess it up?
[09:59.340 --> 10:00.020]  It was fine.
[10:00.120 --> 10:01.620]  It just sort of like, I don't know.
[10:01.680 --> 10:03.400]  Everything was so, like, incentive.
[10:03.540 --> 10:05.600]  Oh, get these cards and that's how you level up.
[10:05.660 --> 10:07.280]  It's like, oh, I kind of just want to play it like a game.
[10:07.380 --> 10:10.180]  It was complicated and not fun.
[10:10.740 --> 10:11.880]  This is fun.
[10:12.660 --> 10:14.360]  World War Z was fun, too.
[10:14.860 --> 10:15.220]  Yeah.
[10:15.220 --> 10:15.680]  I never played that.
[10:15.680 --> 10:16.840]  Yeah, that was a cool one, yeah.
[10:17.420 --> 10:19.520]  So we can all heal and also take a thing, right?
[10:19.860 --> 10:20.340]  Uh-huh.
[10:21.660 --> 10:22.020]  Yeah.
[10:22.400 --> 10:23.420]  A trade for...
[10:23.420 --> 10:26.500]  I don't really need to, though, so if someone wants to...
[10:27.020 --> 10:29.280]  Well, you heal Geoff with it and then get another one.
[10:30.820 --> 10:31.580]  Yeah, that's true.
[10:32.060 --> 10:33.440]  Because Geoff could probably use the boost.
[10:33.620 --> 10:34.660]  Yeah, fucking boost me.
[10:34.820 --> 10:35.480]  I'll heal myself.
[10:35.760 --> 10:36.480]  You can also heal yourself.
[10:36.480 --> 10:37.560]  Actually, I'll just heal myself.
[10:39.280 --> 10:40.000]  That works, too.
[10:40.020 --> 10:40.240]  I gotcha.
[10:40.980 --> 10:41.700]  I gotcha.
[10:43.700 --> 10:46.240]  What would you take, the SMG or the shotgun?
[10:46.500 --> 10:47.720]  And then you shot Geoff.
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.420]  I would take the SMG over the shotgun.
[10:50.160 --> 10:52.400]  You know, I was really hoping nobody would notice.
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.620]  You mean the five points that I lost?
[10:53.640 --> 10:54.400]  Yeah, I noticed.
[10:54.460 --> 10:54.820]  That's okay.
[10:54.960 --> 10:58.280]  I noticed the game said, Andrew hit Geoff.
[10:59.020 --> 11:02.040]  And you presented it to Eric, who's watching your feed.
[11:02.720 --> 11:02.940]  I'm having fun.
[11:02.940 --> 11:04.680]  And so everyone knows.
[11:05.000 --> 11:05.180]  Ah!
[11:05.240 --> 11:06.060]  Are we going?
[11:06.220 --> 11:06.900]  Are we going?
[11:06.940 --> 11:07.620]  The door's open!
[11:07.820 --> 11:08.580]  It's time to go!
[11:08.960 --> 11:09.680]  This is a fun level.
[11:09.860 --> 11:11.680]  God, this game brings back so many fucking memories.
[11:12.560 --> 11:12.920]  Ow!
[11:13.420 --> 11:13.560]  I'm gonna pipe bomb him.
[11:13.560 --> 11:15.940]  I wish video games were still as fun as Left 4 Dead.
[11:16.400 --> 11:17.140]  Yep, pipe bomb.
[11:17.500 --> 11:20.700]  With like a menu that you just turn the game on and then you're in the menu with the lobby
[11:20.700 --> 11:20.980]  and all that?
[11:21.120 --> 11:22.940]  It was so easy for us to play together.
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.260]  It wasn't hard in any way.
[11:24.280 --> 11:24.920]  Ooh, grenade launcher!
[11:25.040 --> 11:28.000]  You don't have to dismiss 19 screens to get to the game.
[11:28.140 --> 11:28.340]  Yep.
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.060]  I didn't have to go through every permutation of every game type Call of Duty has ever had
[11:36.060 --> 11:37.040]  before I can select it.
[11:39.560 --> 11:40.240]  Oh my God!
[11:40.860 --> 11:42.900]  Reload being B is really shitting me up.
[11:43.060 --> 11:45.440]  Yeah, it really does shit you up specifically.
[11:49.880 --> 11:50.680]  What's crouch?
[11:51.760 --> 11:52.460]  Left bumper.
[11:52.660 --> 11:52.940]  Left bumper.
[11:53.180 --> 11:53.900]  Oh, charger!
[11:54.380 --> 11:55.160]  And all I got's a pistol.
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.240]  Ah, Christ!
[11:56.680 --> 11:57.020]  Jockey!
[11:57.400 --> 11:58.180]  I hear a jockey.
[11:58.300 --> 11:58.860]  I hear a jockey.
[11:59.380 --> 11:59.980]  Oh, it's on me!
[12:00.080 --> 12:00.300]  It's on me!
[12:00.400 --> 12:00.600]  It's on me!
[12:02.280 --> 12:03.080]  Got it.
[12:03.120 --> 12:03.600]  Thank you!
[12:05.680 --> 12:06.900]  That could have gone worse.
[12:10.400 --> 12:10.860]  Boomer!
[12:11.320 --> 12:11.780]  Boomer!
[12:12.420 --> 12:12.780]  He's downstairs, maybe?
[12:14.760 --> 12:15.740]  I hear a hunter.
[12:17.180 --> 12:17.640]  Reloading.
[12:18.580 --> 12:19.260]  I'm going to take a look.
[12:19.700 --> 12:20.060]  Oh, Boomer!
[12:20.160 --> 12:20.640]  Hold on, hold on!
[12:20.720 --> 12:21.020]  Ow!
[12:21.860 --> 12:22.320]  Shit!
[12:22.880 --> 12:23.260]  Shit!
[12:23.800 --> 12:25.660]  Are you sputum'd?
[12:26.560 --> 12:27.260]  I got sputum'd.
[12:27.520 --> 12:28.200]  I'm just going into a corner.
[12:28.540 --> 12:29.340]  I got my axe.
[12:31.020 --> 12:32.200]  I'm watching the back.
[12:32.420 --> 12:33.340]  I'm watching the stairs.
[12:35.660 --> 12:37.200]  None of them are coming the back way.
[12:39.800 --> 12:41.440]  Man, I got a lot of ammo. That's great.
[12:42.540 --> 12:43.100]  I don't.
[12:43.280 --> 12:44.700]  Alright, we seem to be clear.
[12:45.680 --> 12:46.000]  No, I do.
[12:48.520 --> 12:49.900]  Oh shit, I wish I had a pipe bomb.
[12:51.340 --> 12:52.700]  I got one if you want me to throw it.
[12:54.680 --> 12:55.100]  Damn it.
[12:55.160 --> 12:55.440]  Gavin!
[12:56.800 --> 12:59.800]  This is walking all the way in front of me there.
[12:59.800 --> 13:00.320]  Ow!
[13:01.980 --> 13:02.960]  Geoff shot me.
[13:03.180 --> 13:03.520]  Uh-uh.
[13:06.360 --> 13:07.500]  I shot Nick.
[13:07.760 --> 13:08.480]  I don't think I shot you.
[13:09.060 --> 13:09.560]  Hey, thanks man.
[13:09.720 --> 13:10.100]  No problem.
[13:10.420 --> 13:10.580]  Alright.
[13:12.400 --> 13:12.840]  Push.
[13:16.060 --> 13:16.940]  Oh God.
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.540]  We all strafed just a hair too much.
[13:21.780 --> 13:22.880]  This is like the worst area.
[13:23.000 --> 13:23.560]  Throwing a pipe bomb.
[13:23.620 --> 13:24.600]  Are we going the long way?
[13:24.680 --> 13:24.940]  Jockey!
[13:25.980 --> 13:26.500]  Got it.
[13:26.520 --> 13:27.080]  Got a good pipe bomb.
[13:27.780 --> 13:28.520]  Nice, Nick.
[13:28.520 --> 13:29.280]  Kill that jockey.
[13:30.620 --> 13:31.060]  Charger!
[13:34.280 --> 13:35.280]  Nice shot, Andrew.
[13:35.660 --> 13:36.560]  Oh, I got gauzed on.
[13:36.800 --> 13:38.260]  Oh no, it's everywhere.
[13:38.620 --> 13:39.460]  Oh, you're getting smoked.
[13:39.760 --> 13:39.960]  Oh shit.
[13:41.800 --> 13:42.560]  Oh, you're getting smoked.
[13:43.260 --> 13:44.120]  I'm coming to you.
[13:44.380 --> 13:45.020]  I'm coming to you.
[13:45.360 --> 13:46.180]  Geoff, back up.
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.120]  God damn it.
[13:48.140 --> 13:49.160]  It's so gross.
[13:50.400 --> 13:51.940]  It's in my mouth.
[13:53.680 --> 13:55.000]  What does it taste like?
[13:56.300 --> 13:57.040]  Oh, it sucks.
[13:57.040 --> 13:57.740]  He likes it.
[13:57.740 --> 13:58.260]  Oh no.
[13:58.340 --> 13:59.420]  Oh no.
[13:59.840 --> 14:01.380]  It's the finest delicacy.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.260]  It's kind of sweet.
[14:02.580 --> 14:04.340]  It's his favorite Halloween flavor.
[14:04.960 --> 14:05.440]  Charger.
[14:05.700 --> 14:06.140]  Tank.
[14:06.400 --> 14:06.880]  Tank!
[14:07.120 --> 14:07.540]  Tank!
[14:07.920 --> 14:10.040]  Geoff loves going out ahead.
[14:10.260 --> 14:10.900]  It's so awesome.
[14:10.900 --> 14:11.780]  That was crazy.
[14:12.220 --> 14:12.500]  I love it.
[14:12.760 --> 14:13.760]  It's so fun.
[14:13.760 --> 14:14.460]  I love it.
[14:14.880 --> 14:15.840]  I don't know why I said pipe bomb.
[14:15.920 --> 14:16.320]  I'm scared.
[14:16.780 --> 14:17.380]  I got you, Geoff.
[14:17.480 --> 14:18.560]  Shoot the things around us.
[14:19.100 --> 14:19.940]  Oh shit.
[14:19.940 --> 14:21.860]  Yeah, there's one of those things is a tank.
[14:21.900 --> 14:22.480]  Oh balls.
[14:22.880 --> 14:23.120]  Ah!
[14:24.240 --> 14:25.000]  Alright, good job.
[14:26.340 --> 14:26.940]  Ah!
[14:27.640 --> 14:28.460]  Oh shit.
[14:28.840 --> 14:30.720]  Your plan was to swing the axe.
[14:30.960 --> 14:31.500]  Oh shit.
[14:31.500 --> 14:33.240]  Well, I was out of ammo, so...
[14:33.240 --> 14:34.640]  Oh, you were.
[14:34.980 --> 14:35.640]  Oh no.
[14:36.000 --> 14:36.640]  I'm burning!
[14:37.220 --> 14:37.400]  Ah!
[14:38.060 --> 14:39.640]  Who threw them all down?
[14:40.440 --> 14:42.840]  I didn't even have a tank!
[14:43.400 --> 14:43.760]  Ah!
[14:45.940 --> 14:47.280]  It's a disaster.
[14:47.520 --> 14:48.780]  I'm on fire again!
[14:49.500 --> 14:50.320]  Goodbye, friends.
[14:51.040 --> 14:51.920]  Please die!
[14:52.160 --> 14:53.260]  Please die!
[14:53.260 --> 14:53.580]  Oh!
[14:56.120 --> 14:56.920]  It's dead!
[14:57.080 --> 14:57.380]  It's dead!
[14:57.860 --> 14:58.140]  Hurry!
[14:58.320 --> 14:58.700]  Come to me!
[14:58.820 --> 14:59.300]  Sixteen!
[14:59.420 --> 14:59.840]  Thirteen!
[15:00.340 --> 15:00.860]  Ten!
[15:01.600 --> 15:01.980]  Nine!
[15:02.020 --> 15:02.320]  Seven!
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.200]  Four!
[15:03.600 --> 15:04.460]  I'm coming in!
[15:04.740 --> 15:05.360]  I'm coming!
[15:05.640 --> 15:06.000]  No!
[15:06.780 --> 15:07.420]  No!
[15:07.800 --> 15:08.780]  Save Gavin.
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.040]  Save Gavin before Geoff.
[15:12.680 --> 15:14.360]  He died in my face!
[15:15.820 --> 15:17.100]  Oh shit.
[15:17.540 --> 15:17.580]  Nick!
[15:17.580 --> 15:18.660]  The, uh...
[15:18.660 --> 15:23.480]  The camera feed might reveal that I'm the one that threw the Molotov.
[15:23.700 --> 15:24.700]  You son of a bitch!
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.740]  I was aiming it at the tank.
[15:27.980 --> 15:29.720]  I was aiming it at the tank, I'd like to point out.
[15:30.240 --> 15:31.260]  Who we all hate.
[15:32.340 --> 15:33.600]  I was by the tank.
[15:33.780 --> 15:35.320]  Good aim, dude.
[15:35.780 --> 15:36.660]  That was a real bummer.
[15:37.120 --> 15:37.300]  Yeah.
[15:38.000 --> 15:38.740]  Didn't need him.
[15:38.760 --> 15:39.260]  I had pills.
[15:41.060 --> 15:43.100]  There's a bag of goo.
[15:44.540 --> 15:45.280]  Bottle of puke.
[15:45.440 --> 15:46.100]  Geoff's favorite.
[15:46.280 --> 15:47.000]  Wait, boomer goo?
[15:47.000 --> 15:47.540]  Yeah.
[15:47.580 --> 15:48.200]  The type of goo.
[15:48.500 --> 15:48.960]  Yeah, the puke.
[15:49.120 --> 15:49.280]  Hey, Eric.
[15:49.800 --> 15:50.460]  Yeah, what's up?
[15:51.040 --> 15:52.200]  Uh, the music works on this.
[15:52.940 --> 15:53.600]  Oh, yeah.
[15:54.740 --> 15:54.980]  Hear it now.
[15:54.980 --> 15:55.720]  Wasn't working on the menu.
[15:55.880 --> 15:56.440]  Oh, it is now.
[15:56.540 --> 15:57.220]  AK-47.
[15:57.980 --> 15:58.340]  Oh, good.
[15:59.020 --> 16:00.480]  Thank God that's here and not earlier.
[16:01.400 --> 16:01.800]  Oh!
[16:02.120 --> 16:03.420]  Nick, I got you, buddy!
[16:03.580 --> 16:04.160]  Oh, bring me back!
[16:05.420 --> 16:06.440]  I'm coming for him!
[16:06.460 --> 16:06.800]  Find me!
[16:07.000 --> 16:07.380]  Get him!
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.740]  You're back!
[16:15.100 --> 16:15.620]  There I am!
[16:15.880 --> 16:16.320]  There you go.
[16:16.600 --> 16:16.980]  Oh!
[16:17.380 --> 16:17.940]  There you go.
[16:18.680 --> 16:19.480]  Bye, bum.
[16:20.220 --> 16:20.980]  Thank you, Andrew!
[16:21.820 --> 16:22.780]  You're welcome, Nick.
[16:23.180 --> 16:24.040]  Oh, I'm coming in!
[16:24.420 --> 16:24.820]  I licked!
[16:25.640 --> 16:26.200]  He's licking me!
[16:27.240 --> 16:28.220]  It's such a licker.
[16:29.260 --> 16:29.840]  Alright, we're good.
[16:29.960 --> 16:30.200]  Alright!
[16:31.500 --> 16:32.040]  Jockey's coming.
[16:32.160 --> 16:32.520]  Jockey's down.
[16:33.940 --> 16:34.460]  How's it going, guys?
[16:34.460 --> 16:34.940]  Behind you.
[16:35.120 --> 16:35.860]  Guys, the fire!
[16:36.400 --> 16:36.840]  There's a lot of fire.
[16:37.260 --> 16:37.880]  I don't know why.
[16:37.940 --> 16:38.680]  Coming up the stairs.
[16:39.660 --> 16:41.060]  I threw a gas can.
[16:41.060 --> 16:41.200]  Oh.
[16:43.060 --> 16:45.460]  Geoff needs healing very bad.
[16:45.620 --> 16:46.180]  Oh, I'm okay.
[16:46.400 --> 16:47.400]  It's just a flesh wound.
[16:48.440 --> 16:49.100]  Alright, let's go.
[16:49.740 --> 16:50.840]  I'll heal you if you go down.
[16:50.960 --> 16:51.800]  Because you're not bleeding today.
[16:52.280 --> 16:53.100]  Yeah, you're alright.
[16:53.840 --> 16:54.160]  Oh!
[16:54.260 --> 16:54.400]  Hunter!
[16:54.520 --> 16:54.840]  Hunter!
[16:56.460 --> 16:57.600]  Where are you, little son of a gun?
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.020]  He's little and he can't reach you.
[16:59.600 --> 17:00.300]  He's a little guy.
[17:00.320 --> 17:00.920]  Oh, I killed him?
[17:01.620 --> 17:01.940]  Nice!
[17:02.220 --> 17:02.540]  Nice!
[17:03.380 --> 17:04.920]  I was aiming for a zombie, but sure.
[17:05.560 --> 17:05.700]  Yeah.
[17:06.020 --> 17:06.860]  Hey, hunters are zombies.
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.420]  Yeah, oh, you know what?
[17:09.240 --> 17:09.940]  Point to me.
[17:10.400 --> 17:10.660]  And Geoff.
[17:12.300 --> 17:13.620]  Andrew's running out of head like always.
[17:13.900 --> 17:14.880]  Andrew's out of here.
[17:15.680 --> 17:16.180]  I'm just...
[17:16.180 --> 17:16.680]  I'm holding.
[17:16.860 --> 17:17.360]  You know what?
[17:17.380 --> 17:17.800]  That's on me.
[17:18.000 --> 17:18.500]  That one's on me.
[17:18.600 --> 17:19.200]  That was...
[17:19.200 --> 17:19.420]  Yeah!
[17:21.680 --> 17:23.520]  There have been plenty that have been on me.
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.120]  That was not one of them.
[17:29.340 --> 17:29.780]  Ah!
[17:30.320 --> 17:30.760]  Dammit!
[17:31.080 --> 17:31.140]  No!
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.240]  Boat town!
[17:34.840 --> 17:35.280]  Uh...
[17:35.280 --> 17:35.800]  Throwing pipe!
[17:36.600 --> 17:37.080]  Can't see it.
[17:37.280 --> 17:37.800]  Oh, my gosh.
[17:38.360 --> 17:38.780]  Oh, shit.
[17:38.980 --> 17:39.320]  Okay.
[17:39.680 --> 17:40.700]  I was about to throw one.
[17:42.320 --> 17:42.760]  Well...
[17:42.760 --> 17:42.940]  Ooh.
[17:43.480 --> 17:43.680]  Nice.
[17:43.860 --> 17:44.460]  Are you throwing at Nick?
[17:44.620 --> 17:46.260]  God bless America.
[17:49.360 --> 17:50.300]  No, Asin!
[17:50.300 --> 17:50.340]  Asin!
[17:50.640 --> 17:51.040]  Spit!
[17:51.260 --> 17:51.660]  Spitter!
[17:52.000 --> 17:52.400]  Charger!
[17:52.560 --> 17:52.820]  Charger!
[17:52.920 --> 17:54.560]  Oh, my God.
[17:54.640 --> 17:55.680]  They're sending everything.
[17:57.580 --> 17:58.340]  Nick is incapacitated.
[17:59.140 --> 17:59.680]  I'm coming for you.
[17:59.720 --> 18:00.360]  Yeah, I'm just chilling.
[18:00.740 --> 18:01.800]  There's a spitter up here somewhere.
[18:02.120 --> 18:03.160]  Yeah, I'm pushing the spitter.
[18:03.880 --> 18:04.560]  You're pushing the spitter?
[18:04.560 --> 18:05.380]  You're pushing the spitter?
[18:06.260 --> 18:06.660]  You're pushing the spitter?
[18:06.880 --> 18:07.520]  Well, I want to.
[18:08.560 --> 18:08.960]  Uh...
[18:08.960 --> 18:09.760]  What the hell is that?
[18:10.120 --> 18:10.540]  Where are you hiding?
[18:11.380 --> 18:12.180]  Healing myself.
[18:12.800 --> 18:13.060]  Yeah.
[18:13.920 --> 18:15.580]  Where the fuck did the spitter go?
[18:15.800 --> 18:16.200]  Uh...
[18:16.200 --> 18:16.740]  I'll cover Geoff.
[18:16.760 --> 18:17.260]  Oh, right here.
[18:18.640 --> 18:18.920]  Thank you.
[18:19.560 --> 18:20.140]  All right.
[18:20.980 --> 18:22.080]  They're putting fire down.
[18:22.280 --> 18:22.720]  Baseball bats.
[18:22.740 --> 18:23.420]  Oh, they're separating us.
[18:23.580 --> 18:24.400]  Cover me, please.
[18:25.460 --> 18:27.640]  Ooh, is this specialty armor?
[18:27.820 --> 18:28.060]  Ammo?
[18:29.280 --> 18:29.640]  Ooh.
[18:30.100 --> 18:30.800]  Fire rounds in here.
[18:31.180 --> 18:31.540]  Gavin!
[18:32.100 --> 18:32.780]  Thank you.
[18:33.000 --> 18:33.600]  Can I use some health?
[18:34.640 --> 18:35.040]  Thank you.
[18:35.080 --> 18:36.960]  I have a defibrillator if we need one, then.
[18:37.180 --> 18:37.440]  Hell yeah.
[18:37.500 --> 18:37.620]  That's good.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.420]  That wasn't in Left 4 Dead 1, right?
[18:40.440 --> 18:41.280]  That's a new one to 2.
[18:41.580 --> 18:42.300]  That is new.
[18:44.000 --> 18:44.860]  Ooh, incendiary rounds.
[18:44.860 --> 18:46.660]  That and the boomer bile are both new, I think.
[18:46.940 --> 18:50.400]  Who just burned to death, dude?
[18:50.660 --> 18:51.340]  Oh, there's a witch.
[18:51.660 --> 18:51.740]  Witch!
[18:52.520 --> 18:54.200]  Well, we could take the shot.
[18:55.680 --> 18:56.360]  Guys, we have...
[18:56.360 --> 18:57.160]  Turn your flashlights off.
[18:57.900 --> 18:58.220]  Well...
[18:58.220 --> 18:58.300]  No!
[18:58.540 --> 18:58.820]  Geoff!
[18:59.760 --> 19:00.240]  Geoff!
[19:00.580 --> 19:00.780]  Geoff!
[19:01.800 --> 19:04.000]  The charger came the other way!
[19:04.440 --> 19:04.800]  Help!
[19:05.680 --> 19:06.520]  Help me!
[19:06.700 --> 19:07.100]  That works.
[19:08.200 --> 19:09.080]  Is she still...
[19:09.080 --> 19:10.180]  Nah, she's dead.
[19:10.740 --> 19:11.220]  Okay.
[19:11.460 --> 19:11.840]  Oh, my God.
[19:11.840 --> 19:12.260]  Take care of her.
[19:13.360 --> 19:15.320]  Oh, the witch ran forward.
[19:15.400 --> 19:16.840]  The charger came up the back.
[19:16.840 --> 19:20.220]  You guys got sandwiched, but in a cool way.
[19:20.440 --> 19:26.480]  We were pincered between a charger and a witch that Geoff threw him all in a cocktail hat without saying anything.
[19:27.540 --> 19:28.740]  What is there to say, really?
[19:29.540 --> 19:33.000]  Yeah, I watched him do it, and I knew he was doing it, you know?
[19:33.280 --> 19:33.460]  Yeah.
[19:33.600 --> 19:35.660]  Well, it was in slow motion for me.
[19:36.100 --> 19:36.320]  Yeah.
[19:38.580 --> 19:39.580]  Surely, he won't.
[19:40.740 --> 19:43.120]  Wow, what are you gonna do? Let it live? You gotta go past it.
[19:43.520 --> 19:43.780]  Oh!
[19:43.960 --> 19:45.040]  There ain't no sneaking past that.
[19:46.200 --> 19:47.820]  There's loads of health. Everyone grab one.
[19:48.300 --> 19:52.080]  Oh, and a laser scope. Laser scope. Over here.
[19:52.540 --> 19:52.920]  And ammo.
[19:54.620 --> 19:55.620]  Loads of ammo.
[19:56.420 --> 19:57.280]  Where's the laser scope?
[19:58.040 --> 19:59.080]  It's over there.
[19:59.500 --> 19:59.760]  Oh, yeah?
[20:00.740 --> 20:02.360]  Was that just accuracy or damage or what?
[20:02.600 --> 20:04.660]  Yeah, it increases your accuracy.
[20:04.760 --> 20:05.100]  More accurate.
[20:06.840 --> 20:09.840]  This bit is real Dawn of the Dead 2004.
[20:12.440 --> 20:13.400]  Zack Snyder?
[20:14.500 --> 20:15.320]  He's the one.
[20:16.640 --> 20:18.900]  A deleted scene where they have to get the Coca-Cola.
[20:19.040 --> 20:19.280]  Yeah.
[20:21.540 --> 20:24.300]  Dude, I almost fucked that palm tree up. I thought it was a zombie.
[20:25.600 --> 20:27.220]  So, what are we doing? We're going there?
[20:27.600 --> 20:30.380]  Yeah, we gotta go in there, and then an alarm will go off.
[20:32.600 --> 20:33.400]  And, uh...
[20:33.400 --> 20:34.920]  Well, I mean, you'll see. Here we go.
[20:35.420 --> 20:37.420]  Well, Geoff has separated from us completely.
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.960]  I missed the jump. I just gotta go around.
[20:39.960 --> 20:43.880]  No, I don't blame you. It was more that the door was opened.
[20:43.940 --> 20:46.060]  How many is it?
[20:46.500 --> 20:46.760]  Just one.
[20:46.940 --> 20:47.820]  Just one pack.
[20:48.220 --> 20:49.560]  Run it back.
[20:49.760 --> 20:50.160]  Got it.
[20:51.040 --> 20:52.020]  There's a lot of them.
[20:52.920 --> 20:53.560]  Anyone got a pipe?
[20:54.960 --> 20:56.460]  I do, but I'm holding the Coke.
[20:56.520 --> 20:57.340]  I just have a molly.
[20:58.040 --> 20:58.680]  They're burning.
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.360]  There's a...
[21:00.860 --> 21:02.300]  Charger! Charger! Charger! Charger!
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.000]  I threw the Coke.
[21:05.200 --> 21:06.620]  I think I hear a hunter out there.
[21:08.540 --> 21:09.300]  Is that a smoker?
[21:09.300 --> 21:10.540]  Yep. Smoker's down.
[21:11.100 --> 21:13.100]  Throwing some punches with this Coke.
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.120]  Maybe I heard the smoker, then.
[21:18.000 --> 21:18.700]  Get away!
[21:18.860 --> 21:19.320]  Ah, shit.
[21:20.200 --> 21:20.500]  Alright.
[21:21.400 --> 21:22.900]  Taste my cola fists!
[21:25.420 --> 21:26.840]  Oh, shit!
[21:27.380 --> 21:30.280]  Get out of the car! Get off, fool!
[21:30.580 --> 21:32.520]  Oh, Nick is down again!
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.080]  Alright, we can get him. Hold on.
[21:34.600 --> 21:34.900]  You got him?
[21:36.360 --> 21:37.040]  I got him.
[21:39.080 --> 21:39.900]  Thank you, guys.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.240]  Okay.
[21:43.320 --> 21:43.680]  Oh!
[21:44.060 --> 21:44.420]  Moving.
[21:49.810 --> 21:50.690]  Hop in the van.
[21:51.550 --> 21:51.850]  Uh-oh.
[21:52.370 --> 21:54.150]  Uh, more of them. More of them. More of them. More of them.
[21:54.210 --> 21:54.830]  Oh, yeah.
[21:55.090 --> 21:56.730]  You fucking twat. Get off me.
[21:57.370 --> 21:58.390]  Oh, there's a linker somewhere.
[21:58.570 --> 21:59.670]  Shit. Shit. Shit. I'm in a real bad spot.
[22:00.070 --> 22:00.550]  Where are you?
[22:01.830 --> 22:02.550]  I'm jockeyed!
[22:03.590 --> 22:04.130]  Alright, jockey's on for you.
[22:04.130 --> 22:04.510]  Cola down!
[22:05.830 --> 22:06.470]  Thank you.
[22:06.990 --> 22:08.890]  Ah, shit. Get off me, you bastards!
[22:10.010 --> 22:11.990]  Oh, you know what? I regret that decision instantly.
[22:12.250 --> 22:12.870]  Yep, he sure is.
[22:13.570 --> 22:14.250]  Pushing back.
[22:15.470 --> 22:16.710]  Gavin's down, but we can save him.
[22:16.710 --> 22:17.190]  Oh, Smoker! Smoker!
[22:17.390 --> 22:18.170]  We're gonna save him. Don't worry.
[22:18.330 --> 22:19.410]  Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?
[22:19.610 --> 22:20.610]  I'm above you!
[22:20.770 --> 22:21.150]  I'm coming.
[22:21.710 --> 22:22.370]  Ow. Ow. Ow.
[22:22.370 --> 22:23.770]  I'm dying! I'm almost dead!
[22:23.870 --> 22:24.250]  Got you!
[22:24.410 --> 22:24.990]  Where are you at, Gavin?
[22:25.250 --> 22:26.730]  I've got my shit pushed in outside.
[22:28.290 --> 22:29.650]  Oh, keep him off me.
[22:29.730 --> 22:30.490]  Oh, no. Gavin!
[22:30.750 --> 22:31.970]  We'll get to Gavin. He's dead.
[22:32.810 --> 22:33.110]  No, I can't.
[22:33.110 --> 22:33.430]  Defib!
[22:34.210 --> 22:34.930]  Oh, yeah. Defib.
[22:34.930 --> 22:36.890]  I'm limping to deliver the cola.
[22:40.070 --> 22:42.430]  Oh, I'm limping. I'm limping.
[22:43.050 --> 22:43.910]  I have a defib.
[22:44.870 --> 22:46.230]  No, he's not dead yet.
[22:47.990 --> 22:49.210]  I think you get him.
[22:52.670 --> 22:54.870]  Are you going slow because you're hurt?
[22:55.030 --> 22:57.580]  Yes, I'm not intentionally going slow.
[22:58.490 --> 23:00.030]  I thought maybe you thought it was funny.
[23:00.570 --> 23:02.190]  Trying not to bring back any of those zombies.
[23:04.370 --> 23:05.510]  You just hit me.
[23:06.150 --> 23:06.270]  What?
[23:07.590 --> 23:08.490]  Why won't it let me?
[23:08.550 --> 23:09.190]  There it goes.
[23:10.430 --> 23:11.690]  Because I was healing you.
[23:11.690 --> 23:12.750]  Oh, okay.
[23:12.970 --> 23:14.030]  Oh, I had a horrible dream.
[23:14.830 --> 23:16.550]  Okay, you guys need to get out of here.
[23:16.950 --> 23:18.030]  Yeah, let's move.
[23:18.350 --> 23:18.630]  Let's go.
[23:20.290 --> 23:21.030]  Good job, Gavin.
[23:22.870 --> 23:23.750]  Uh-oh.
[23:24.110 --> 23:24.970]  Hunter. Hunter. Hunter.
[23:26.170 --> 23:26.930]  Oh, wow.
[23:29.390 --> 23:30.710]  I think there's a...
[23:31.150 --> 23:31.590]  Okay.
[23:36.450 --> 23:38.710]  I'm 13% and going down.
[23:39.350 --> 23:40.110]  Down. Down. Down.
[23:40.110 --> 23:40.310]  Go. Run.
[23:42.590 --> 23:43.710]  I just got to move.
[23:48.100 --> 23:48.760]  Come on, Geoff.
[23:49.080 --> 23:49.580]  I got you.
[23:49.720 --> 23:50.420]  I just got to move.
[23:50.620 --> 23:51.320]  I'm like Andrew.
[23:51.440 --> 23:52.020]  I just got to move.
[23:52.280 --> 23:52.640]  9%.
[23:53.740 --> 23:54.340]  Keep going.
[23:55.940 --> 23:56.300]  8%.
[23:58.460 --> 24:00.640]  Oh, you're still moving fairly quickly, at least.
[24:00.880 --> 24:01.580]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[24:01.820 --> 24:03.960]  7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, banana.
[24:04.720 --> 24:04.980]  Okay.
[24:05.360 --> 24:05.920]  I got to heal.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.020]  All right, you're in the safe.
[24:08.120 --> 24:08.360]  You're good.
[24:10.040 --> 24:10.400]  Yeah.
[24:12.660 --> 24:13.020]  Easy.
[24:13.020 --> 24:13.900]  Wow, Gavin.
[24:15.220 --> 24:18.740]  Gavin fucking mowing people down.
[24:19.480 --> 24:21.200]  I went to Motown.
[24:22.520 --> 24:23.720]  I mowed the tank.
[24:23.960 --> 24:24.460]  Yeah, you did.
[24:24.740 --> 24:26.100]  You're the only one who could.
[24:29.320 --> 24:32.360]  I couldn't even see the tank because the flames were so high.
[24:32.580 --> 24:34.800]  Yeah, but who set the most witches on fire?
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.120]  Let's see.
[24:37.240 --> 24:37.720]  We'll find out.
[24:38.160 --> 24:40.640]  I couldn't even see the tank because I was on fire.
[24:41.420 --> 24:41.880]  Witch.
[24:43.660 --> 24:48.460]  I did zero damage because the charger fucked me up as soon as it happened.
[24:49.900 --> 24:52.040]  Okay, so three med packs.
[24:52.140 --> 24:52.860]  I used mine already.
[24:53.020 --> 24:53.580]  I'm going to use mine.
[24:57.500 --> 24:58.540]  Healing meself.
[25:02.140 --> 25:03.700]  Molotov right outside the door.
[25:04.680 --> 25:06.220]  Working on just clearing the mall.
[25:07.060 --> 25:08.000]  Does anyone want a sniper?
[25:08.960 --> 25:09.760]  I've already got one.
[25:10.280 --> 25:10.440]  Oh.
[25:13.020 --> 25:13.840]  I don't know why I asked.
[25:13.920 --> 25:14.520]  I knew you were here.
[25:16.380 --> 25:17.040]  We good?
[25:17.180 --> 25:17.260]  Yeah.
[25:17.580 --> 25:18.120]  Let's go.
[25:18.620 --> 25:19.200]  Off we pop.
[25:20.400 --> 25:21.100]  Off we pop.
[25:22.700 --> 25:23.140]  Pills.
[25:24.680 --> 25:25.120]  Alright.
[25:29.420 --> 25:31.080]  Okay, second floor is pretty clear.
[25:34.590 --> 25:35.410]  You okay, Geoff?
[25:35.410 --> 25:37.110]  Yeah, I'm just not as fast as y'all.
[25:37.990 --> 25:38.530]  These days.
[25:41.050 --> 25:43.590]  Got that 35% health speed, you know.
[25:44.390 --> 25:44.990]  Yeah, sure.
[25:46.130 --> 25:48.830]  Dude, I had some fun on this floor making videos.
[25:50.750 --> 25:52.510]  Making Hashima guides back in the day.
[25:53.010 --> 25:54.010]  Like shoot Gavin in the back.
[25:54.110 --> 25:55.550]  Yeah, I got that guy again just now.
[25:57.510 --> 25:58.390]  Spit her down.
[26:01.090 --> 26:02.370]  I hear witch.
[26:03.610 --> 26:03.890]  Boomer.
[26:03.970 --> 26:04.370]  Boomer.
[26:05.450 --> 26:05.850]  Nice shot.
[26:06.090 --> 26:06.450]  Nice.
[26:07.370 --> 26:08.270]  Spit her somewhere.
[26:08.750 --> 26:08.850]  No.
[26:09.150 --> 26:10.390]  No, we just had that smoker.
[26:10.870 --> 26:11.470]  Oh, I got smoked.
[26:11.570 --> 26:11.970]  I got smoked.
[26:12.050 --> 26:12.390]  He's dead.
[26:12.390 --> 26:13.190]  Got him.
[26:13.550 --> 26:16.950]  His tongue went around the corner like it was a bullet and wanted it.
[26:17.170 --> 26:18.950]  He James McAvoy'd it.
[26:19.690 --> 26:19.870]  Yeah.
[26:21.590 --> 26:22.470]  Whipped his head.
[26:24.330 --> 26:24.730]  Hung me.
[26:26.290 --> 26:27.010]  Second pistol.
[26:28.870 --> 26:29.690]  Oh my god.
[26:30.770 --> 26:31.890]  I forgot about all these additions.
[26:32.890 --> 26:33.710]  Where's the witch?
[26:33.710 --> 26:33.730]  Where's the witch?
[26:34.870 --> 26:35.730]  Geoff will find her, don't worry.
[26:35.750 --> 26:36.550]  Yeah, I'm looking, don't worry.
[26:37.050 --> 26:38.330]  Yeah, Geoff's gonna melt her.
[26:38.330 --> 26:41.170]  He's got his Molotov ready and he's ready to go number one again on this one, baby.
[26:42.190 --> 26:43.790]  Someone's gotta be at the top of that leaderboard.
[26:45.490 --> 26:47.390]  Listen, if you don't kill the witch, she's gonna kill you.
[26:48.690 --> 26:49.790]  It's a witch or bewitched world.
[26:49.810 --> 26:50.290]  Yeah, that sounds right.
[26:52.930 --> 26:54.330]  I got lost.
[26:55.070 --> 26:55.950]  Yeah, I don't know where we're going.
[26:56.410 --> 26:57.190]  Did you go down again?
[26:57.490 --> 26:59.370]  That was the tagline for the Bewitched movie, right?
[26:59.710 --> 27:00.330]  Is it down again?
[27:01.690 --> 27:02.810]  The witch is down there.
[27:04.090 --> 27:05.210]  Oh, horde, horde, horde, horde.
[27:07.470 --> 27:08.930]  Axin. Oh, jockeyed.
[27:10.290 --> 27:11.950]  Oh, this is real bad for me.
[27:11.990 --> 27:12.790]  I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.
[27:13.590 --> 27:16.290]  Oh, I'm with Geoff now in the slow running club.
[27:16.290 --> 27:16.750]  That sucks.
[27:17.150 --> 27:17.910]  Oh, I'm about to go down.
[27:18.270 --> 27:19.910]  One percent, hold it, hold it.
[27:19.930 --> 27:20.550]  Oh, I shot you.
[27:22.710 --> 27:24.130]  I put you out of your misery.
[27:25.370 --> 27:27.570]  One percent, yeah, fuck you. How about that?
[27:28.030 --> 27:28.910]  Well, I was like...
[27:28.910 --> 27:30.510]  Oh my god.
[27:31.970 --> 27:33.110]  That was Geoff.
[27:33.190 --> 27:35.350]  I said one percent, mix and eat the rich.
[27:35.350 --> 27:36.650]  I didn't do nothing. That was Gavin.
[27:37.890 --> 27:38.530]  I did?
[27:38.970 --> 27:39.950]  I didn't fire my gun.
[27:40.910 --> 27:41.310]  Hmm.
[27:41.510 --> 27:42.330]  I was just walking.
[27:48.600 --> 27:51.000]  I'm gonna pop my adrenaline coming up.
[27:52.240 --> 27:53.960]  Oh shit, that's not a zombie. Jesus.
[27:54.960 --> 27:56.480]  See? See what this guy's doing?
[27:56.600 --> 27:57.560]  He's a fucking maniac.
[27:57.560 --> 27:57.860]  Oh, a mannequin?
[27:58.560 --> 27:59.800]  That was a mannequin.
[28:03.490 --> 28:06.610]  Oh shit, I'm getting smoked and charger, charger, charger in the hallway.
[28:06.810 --> 28:07.010]  He's dead.
[28:07.010 --> 28:07.470]  Okay, I got it.
[28:08.430 --> 28:08.830]  He's dead.
[28:08.910 --> 28:10.590]  Jesus Christ.
[28:11.210 --> 28:11.630]  Oh, fuck.
[28:11.850 --> 28:12.990]  Back up, back up, back up.
[28:15.370 --> 28:18.470]  Don't shoot him. Remember, we can punch him away, and then we can shoot him.
[28:24.530 --> 28:25.170]  Nice job.
[28:27.150 --> 28:28.350]  Did I shoot him through the wall?
[28:28.950 --> 28:29.610]  Where I missed?
[28:30.170 --> 28:30.790]  I didn't shoot him.
[28:30.970 --> 28:31.330]  Oh, you know what?
[28:33.450 --> 28:34.770]  Yeah, Geoff doesn't even know how to fire his gun.
[28:34.890 --> 28:38.450]  I keep getting all kinds of credit and blame for pulling the trigger when I don't.
[28:39.550 --> 28:40.330]  Andrew, do you want...
[28:40.890 --> 28:41.910]  Do you want my health, Andrew?
[28:42.590 --> 28:44.950]  No, it's fine. You keep yours. I don't want to steal.
[28:45.950 --> 28:46.390]  Steal?
[28:47.110 --> 28:49.050]  When you fall down again, we'll heal you.
[28:53.120 --> 28:53.980]  Who was that?
[28:54.120 --> 28:54.400]  That's a bad...
[28:57.620 --> 28:58.500]  Oh shit.
[29:00.120 --> 29:03.020]  Okay, alarm is off. I'm popping my...
[29:03.020 --> 29:05.060]  Oh, jockey, jockey, jockey, jockey, jockey, jockey.
[29:06.020 --> 29:06.720]  Nice shooting.
[29:06.980 --> 29:09.540]  I'm popping the adrenaline to just try to book it there.
[29:10.560 --> 29:11.680]  I have low health.
[29:11.700 --> 29:12.100]  Charger!
[29:12.420 --> 29:13.160]  Oh my god.
[29:15.260 --> 29:16.160]  Oh, shot Geoff.
[29:16.680 --> 29:17.020]  Thank you.
[29:17.180 --> 29:17.220]  Oh no.
[29:17.980 --> 29:18.460]  Another charger.
[29:19.480 --> 29:20.200]  Second one.
[29:20.500 --> 29:20.840]  Ow!
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.760]  How many times do I have to hit the thing?
[29:23.280 --> 29:23.680]  One.
[29:23.920 --> 29:25.300]  Was that the same charger or was that two?
[29:25.380 --> 29:26.080]  No, it's another one.
[29:27.640 --> 29:28.580]  It's charger town.
[29:28.760 --> 29:28.980]  Ow!
[29:29.680 --> 29:30.520]  It was payback.
[29:31.300 --> 29:31.860]  You know what? Fair.
[29:32.980 --> 29:33.760]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[29:34.160 --> 29:34.820]  Stop, crash.
[29:35.140 --> 29:35.360]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[29:36.020 --> 29:37.220]  Gavin, why are you down there still?
[29:37.660 --> 29:38.440]  Uh, there's a...
[29:38.440 --> 29:39.260]  Oh my god.
[29:39.280 --> 29:39.660]  Oh.
[29:39.660 --> 29:40.500]  Oh my god!
[29:42.200 --> 29:43.140]  I got problems.
[29:43.980 --> 29:44.380]  Jockeyed!
[29:45.300 --> 29:46.720]  Geoff, are you over...
[29:46.720 --> 29:46.860]  I'm working on it.
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.480]  I'm too slow.
[29:50.180 --> 29:51.820]  Someone has to turn the alarm off.
[29:53.260 --> 29:54.240]  Are you hitting me, Nick?
[29:54.700 --> 29:55.720]  No, maybe.
[29:55.880 --> 29:57.200]  Yeah, there was a jockey all over you.
[29:57.320 --> 29:57.660]  Oh, okay.
[29:58.340 --> 29:59.960]  Yeah, he was definitely all over you.
[30:00.100 --> 30:01.500]  And also carrying an axe.
[30:01.900 --> 30:04.860]  I just turned around and I just saw Nick swinging an axe at my head.
[30:05.960 --> 30:06.760]  I'm fading.
[30:06.940 --> 30:07.380]  I'm down.
[30:08.000 --> 30:08.680]  Gotta pick up...
[30:08.680 --> 30:09.420]  Oh, looking good.
[30:09.780 --> 30:10.420]  Oh, shading!
[30:10.740 --> 30:11.120]  Getting the energy first.
[30:12.000 --> 30:12.180]  Alright.
[30:12.300 --> 30:14.160]  Alright, I cleared out the pile.
[30:14.160 --> 30:15.740]  I got Geoff.
[30:16.480 --> 30:16.740]  Alarm!
[30:17.400 --> 30:18.820]  I'm in black and white mode.
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.300]  Now you want healing?
[30:21.680 --> 30:22.160]  No, I got...
[30:22.160 --> 30:23.180]  No, wait until we're in the safe room.
[30:23.940 --> 30:25.060]  Who closed that door?
[30:25.160 --> 30:26.160]  I know, motherfuckers.
[30:31.540 --> 30:32.900]  Oh, I needed that.
[30:33.900 --> 30:36.080]  I might heal myself just so I'm not slow.
[30:36.760 --> 30:38.160]  I don't wanna use the...
[30:40.140 --> 30:40.800]  Oh boy!
[30:41.080 --> 30:42.020]  Back up, back up, back up!
[30:42.080 --> 30:42.700]  Hold on, don't shoot him.
[30:42.700 --> 30:43.220]  Don't sh...
[30:43.220 --> 30:44.700]  Don't sh...
[30:46.360 --> 30:46.980]  There we go.
[30:47.240 --> 30:47.960]  Oh, a jockey.
[30:47.960 --> 30:48.680]  I killed a jockey?
[30:49.960 --> 30:51.320]  I think the boomer's still alive then.
[30:51.660 --> 30:53.000]  No, he's in pieces on the floor.
[30:53.060 --> 30:53.700]  No, he killed the boomer.
[30:53.720 --> 30:54.300]  Oh, he sure is.
[30:54.360 --> 30:56.200]  He might have exploded and killed a jockey.
[30:56.920 --> 30:58.180]  Oh, that's how that worked, huh?
[30:58.640 --> 30:58.940]  Cool.
[31:01.040 --> 31:02.580]  And we're at the final stretch.
[31:10.580 --> 31:10.940]  Spit!
[31:11.480 --> 31:12.180]  Oh, spitter.
[31:12.620 --> 31:13.340]  Spit, spit, spit!
[31:13.340 --> 31:14.360]  Come up, come up, Geoff, come up!
[31:14.360 --> 31:14.840]  Geoff, get up!
[31:14.860 --> 31:15.380]  I'm up, I'm up.
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.000]  Has anyone picked up a cloth?
[31:21.980 --> 31:23.100]  Anyone have a mop?
[31:23.380 --> 31:24.080]  And a bucket.
[31:27.260 --> 31:32.120]  Okay, we got zombies coming up from behind.
[31:32.280 --> 31:32.920]  Is that another spitter?
[31:33.000 --> 31:34.020]  Keep moving, we'll be fine.
[31:40.700 --> 31:41.820]  Oh, a hunter, I think.
[31:42.620 --> 31:42.860]  Yeah.
[31:43.660 --> 31:43.920]  Hunter!
[31:45.420 --> 31:45.820]  Whoa!
[31:46.120 --> 31:46.920]  Holy shit!
[31:46.920 --> 31:47.420]  I got it.
[31:47.420 --> 31:48.280]  I get it.
[31:50.460 --> 31:51.340]  You're welcome.
[31:53.300 --> 31:54.180]  Oh, no!
[31:55.840 --> 31:56.740]  Should we pipe on it?
[31:57.500 --> 31:58.600]  I'm throwing a molotov.
[31:59.220 --> 32:00.700]  Oh, I also threw a molotov.
[32:01.180 --> 32:01.760]  And Geoff's dead.
[32:02.080 --> 32:03.020]  Geoff, get out of there!
[32:05.520 --> 32:06.560]  Get out of there.
[32:07.040 --> 32:08.760]  Geoff, get out of the fire, what are you doing?
[32:09.600 --> 32:10.580]  Oh shit, oh shit!
[32:12.020 --> 32:13.000]  Who closed the door?
[32:14.040 --> 32:14.300]  Ow.
[32:14.640 --> 32:15.700]  Could use some teammate help.
[32:16.020 --> 32:16.600]  Andrew left.
[32:16.600 --> 32:18.260]  He just ran right by me.
[32:18.840 --> 32:20.500]  For the greater good!
[32:22.260 --> 32:22.720]  Got him.
[32:23.000 --> 32:23.620]  Andrew left you guys.
[32:23.640 --> 32:24.880]  Way to go!
[32:25.300 --> 32:25.600]  Nice.
[32:26.100 --> 32:26.820]  Don't get Geoff first.
[32:26.820 --> 32:29.000]  Nick's fucking MVP on that thing.
[32:29.440 --> 32:30.780]  Andrew couldn't be bothered.
[32:31.180 --> 32:32.640]  For the greater good!
[32:32.980 --> 32:35.160]  He's taking down... oh my god.
[32:35.440 --> 32:38.420]  Wow, Nick, what an MVP performance, dude.
[32:38.840 --> 32:41.300]  Man, I learned a lot about Andrew today.
[32:41.440 --> 32:42.220]  Yeah, me too, man.
[32:42.240 --> 32:43.460]  I lit the tank on fire!
[32:43.680 --> 32:44.680]  And then ran away!
[32:45.380 --> 32:46.620]  To the safe room!
[32:47.420 --> 32:48.980]  Right, yeah, yeah, he ran right to the safe room.
[32:49.080 --> 32:50.300]  As long as Andrew's safe, right?
[32:50.380 --> 32:52.100]  As long as Andrew's okay, yeah.
[32:52.420 --> 32:52.900]  No problem.
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.940]  We all carry forward, we all move with the...
[32:55.940 --> 32:58.320]  As long as Andrew's okay, then it should be totally fine.
[32:59.460 --> 33:00.540]  MVP performance from Nick.
[33:00.580 --> 33:04.800]  As long as you get some flowers for my widow and orphans, that would be fantastic.
[33:05.560 --> 33:08.280]  Looking out for Andrew number one, that's all we're doing.
[33:08.300 --> 33:08.880]  Oh, goo!
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.700]  Cover me, cover me, cover me!
[33:12.700 --> 33:14.800]  He kicked me when he ran by me.
[33:19.320 --> 33:20.940]  So, should we just go in and close it?
[33:21.080 --> 33:23.080]  Yeah, just get in here.
[33:23.780 --> 33:24.300]  We did it!
[33:24.520 --> 33:25.320]  He said cover me.
[33:27.540 --> 33:28.780]  That I did. Wow!
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.340]  Killed the most infected, look at that, by a lot.
[33:31.720 --> 33:32.700]  Wow, you had Molotovs.
[33:33.380 --> 33:37.380]  It's cause you had plenty of time to shoot while we were saving each other's lives.
[33:37.660 --> 33:38.520]  That's some horse shit.
[33:38.720 --> 33:39.680]  Well, you had Molotovs.
[33:39.680 --> 33:40.160]  Yeah.
[33:41.780 --> 33:43.500]  I mean, yeah, that's really it.
[33:44.040 --> 33:45.600]  Yeah, if they had a...
[33:45.600 --> 33:48.740]  The rest of the damage to the tank is what it took to kill the tank, so that way nobody else died.
[33:50.020 --> 33:53.660]  If they had a card that said most damage to Geoff, you'd also be on that list.
[33:56.140 --> 33:58.380]  Number one, number one little bullet, baby.
[33:59.580 --> 34:01.960]  Oh, guess who's at the top again.
[34:04.180 --> 34:05.680]  The top of Melee Mountain.
[34:06.400 --> 34:06.820]  Yeah.
[34:08.180 --> 34:08.600]  Zagab.
[34:09.020 --> 34:09.380]  Yeah.
[34:10.440 --> 34:11.860]  Are you gonna heal now?
[34:12.160 --> 34:12.280]  Yeah.
[34:13.560 --> 34:16.220]  Should I gamble and not heal right now?
[34:17.660 --> 34:19.120]  Okay, well I guess I'm not gonna do that.
[34:22.160 --> 34:23.240]  Take it out of the equation.
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.720]  Still got one health pack, if anyone wants it.
[34:28.220 --> 34:28.940]  Andrew, you want it?
[34:29.440 --> 34:30.500]  Who's got the lowest health, Andrew?
[34:30.940 --> 34:32.680]  Yeah, he needs the most health, he's looking out for number one.
[34:33.120 --> 34:33.500]  That's true.
[34:33.840 --> 34:36.020]  Looking out for number one as in the team.
[34:37.360 --> 34:38.520]  As a team move.
[34:38.840 --> 34:40.340]  By getting yourself to safety.
[34:40.480 --> 34:41.080]  It actually would have been...
[34:41.080 --> 34:41.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.580]  To advance us, yeah. It actually would have been selfish of me to stay behind.
[34:46.540 --> 34:47.680]  And risk us losing progress.
[34:47.680 --> 34:49.400]  Nick, thank you for your selfish actions.
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.560]  You kept Gavin and I alive, I really... I know it was selfish, but I appreciate it.
[34:53.580 --> 34:56.820]  And if you really think about it, I'm here for everyone, but more importantly myself.
[34:57.960 --> 35:01.200]  So, without that...
[35:01.200 --> 35:02.500]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, whatever...
[35:02.500 --> 35:04.960]  Hey, Andrew, whatever you say, man. Absolutely.
[35:06.200 --> 35:07.060]  Oh, no.
[35:07.940 --> 35:09.360]  Build a car with gas.
[35:10.200 --> 35:12.140]  Find a gas can. Step one.
[35:12.220 --> 35:13.940]  Remember, you can chuck the gas canisters.
[35:14.200 --> 35:14.640]  Oh, yeah.
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.480]  How many you need? Like, seven or something?
[35:17.960 --> 35:18.240]  Thirteen?
[35:18.880 --> 35:22.860]  This is, I think, where we farmed the defib achievement, Geoff.
[35:24.140 --> 35:27.700]  We would just, like, jump off the top railing and defib and then run up.
[35:27.820 --> 35:28.720]  That sounds familiar.
[35:29.900 --> 35:32.020]  So, should we go high first or...?
[35:33.720 --> 35:34.880]  I'm gonna grab this one.
[35:34.880 --> 35:37.680]  So, what are we doing? Just chucking them all nearby and then going for another one?
[35:37.940 --> 35:38.900]  I think so.
[35:38.960 --> 35:39.700]  Yeah, probably.
[35:39.820 --> 35:40.160]  I'm loading.
[35:42.400 --> 35:44.660]  God, there's thirty... I don't remember there being...
[35:45.760 --> 35:46.220]  Junkie!
[35:46.720 --> 35:47.200]  Got it.
[35:47.420 --> 35:47.840]  Thank you.
[35:47.900 --> 35:50.620]  Don't worry, Nick's here to protect you.
[35:51.060 --> 35:51.520]  Hannah!
[35:52.620 --> 35:54.120]  Are you kidding me?
[35:55.500 --> 35:56.420]  I got it.
[35:56.460 --> 35:58.300]  Don't worry, Nick's here to protect you.
[35:58.720 --> 35:58.980]  Ah, spit!
[35:59.560 --> 36:02.580]  I can't do all the bad things that are happening to me.
[36:04.200 --> 36:05.300]  I got the gas can.
[36:05.560 --> 36:06.760]  I can't help you with that.
[36:09.920 --> 36:12.100]  Nick, there's only so much you can do.
[36:12.180 --> 36:13.860]  I know! I'm doing everything I can!
[36:14.780 --> 36:18.000]  Hey, you know what? You're doing everything you can.
[36:19.200 --> 36:20.480]  Did someone take my gas can?
[36:21.120 --> 36:22.600]  Yeah, I grabbed it. I made sure it was okay.
[36:23.040 --> 36:24.260]  Oh my god, I'm so...
[36:24.260 --> 36:27.140]  Nick's up at the second floor trying to toss them down here.
[36:27.380 --> 36:28.740]  Yeah, I got a couple coming your way.
[36:30.260 --> 36:31.540]  I'm grabbing and filling.
[36:32.560 --> 36:34.440]  Oh, Gavin, you need to heal.
[36:34.600 --> 36:35.600]  I was in the middle of healing.
[36:36.820 --> 36:37.600]  Getting you.
[36:39.420 --> 36:39.960]  Thank you.
[36:41.340 --> 36:42.180]  No problem.
[36:42.420 --> 36:43.160]  Take one of these.
[36:45.740 --> 36:46.820]  Gonna heal my ass.
[36:46.820 --> 36:48.020]  I don't know why I'm fucking around with that anymore.
[36:48.400 --> 36:48.700]  What's up, Nick?
[36:49.520 --> 36:51.400]  Hey, man. Welcome to Party Town.
[36:52.580 --> 36:54.140]  Hey, Geoff, there's pills over here.
[36:55.340 --> 36:56.180]  Pills, huh?
[36:57.160 --> 36:58.080]  Get pills!
[36:58.080 --> 37:00.180]  Oh, I didn't know there was an opening over here. Interesting.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.380]  Where's our pile at?
[37:01.520 --> 37:02.720]  Shit, shit, shit, shit.
[37:02.780 --> 37:03.040]  On the ground?
[37:03.040 --> 37:03.800]  Down by where you went down.
[37:03.800 --> 37:04.340]  In the car.
[37:05.680 --> 37:06.840]  Yeah, by where?
[37:07.280 --> 37:09.480]  He threw like four down by where you went down.
[37:10.540 --> 37:11.880]  Spinner! Move, Geoff, move!
[37:12.520 --> 37:13.560]  You got him. You killed him.
[37:15.440 --> 37:15.760]  Boomtown.
[37:16.020 --> 37:16.440]  That was rough.
[37:17.060 --> 37:18.160]  Geoff, don't forget about your pills.
[37:18.560 --> 37:19.140]  Just took them.
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.540]  We gotta get up, Nick. How do we get up?
[37:22.500 --> 37:24.160]  I thought that was a stairwell. It is not.
[37:24.180 --> 37:25.440]  It is not. I thought the same thing.
[37:26.520 --> 37:27.160]  Oh, shit.
[37:29.000 --> 37:30.020]  Is it across to your left?
[37:30.020 --> 37:30.500]  Oh, over here, Geoff.
[37:30.560 --> 37:30.780]  It's there.
[37:31.880 --> 37:32.160]  Coming.
[37:35.200 --> 37:35.480]  Somewhere.
[37:36.260 --> 37:37.360]  No, keep going through there.
[37:37.460 --> 37:39.080]  Oh, you're right. We have to go through the...
[37:39.080 --> 37:40.700]  Yeah, turn around, turn around, turn around. No.
[37:41.380 --> 37:42.400]  You're not turning around. It's not right there.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.360]  Oh, I guess not. We have to go down to the ground floor, I think, for it.
[37:45.480 --> 37:46.860]  Oh, oh, Hunter, Hunter, Hunter.
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.360]  We gotta go down to go up, or what?
[37:50.700 --> 37:51.320]  I think so.
[37:51.960 --> 37:53.720]  Oh, there's the stairs over there. Okay.
[37:54.260 --> 37:55.720]  That tank's in a little gazebo.
[37:56.000 --> 37:57.000]  Yep, we got a tank.
[37:59.740 --> 38:00.460]  One of...
[38:00.460 --> 38:01.080]  Oh, he's climbing the wall.
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.080]  He's climbing the wall.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.380]  He is? Oh, shit. He was coming after me.
[38:06.380 --> 38:06.740]  Ouch.
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.560]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[38:08.820 --> 38:10.200]  Sounds like he's mighty close.
[38:11.380 --> 38:12.720]  Oh, there's health packs over here.
[38:13.220 --> 38:14.520]  Oh, there's the tank.
[38:16.420 --> 38:17.860]  Oh, Nick, what are you doing?
[38:18.080 --> 38:18.740]  I got the other one.
[38:18.780 --> 38:19.320]  Living forever.
[38:19.920 --> 38:20.280]  Oh, shit.
[38:24.420 --> 38:25.020]  Where'd he go?
[38:25.220 --> 38:25.640]  Oh, he's right here.
[38:25.660 --> 38:26.620]  Oh, nice tosses, fellas.
[38:26.940 --> 38:27.760]  What the fuck?
[38:27.940 --> 38:28.920]  Oh, my God.
[38:30.560 --> 38:31.600]  You guys okay?
[38:31.940 --> 38:33.060]  No, he got me down.
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.720]  I put a lot into him, though. Hopefully it's...
[38:36.720 --> 38:37.440]  Still shooting him.
[38:38.140 --> 38:39.060]  You fuck off.
[38:39.200 --> 38:39.380]  Going up.
[38:40.680 --> 38:41.800]  You fuck off.
[38:43.940 --> 38:44.340]  Alright.
[38:44.500 --> 38:45.200]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.160]  Still shooting at him.
[38:47.900 --> 38:48.540]  He went down.
[38:48.580 --> 38:49.200]  He's down, he's down.
[38:49.220 --> 38:50.260]  He's down, he's down, he's down.
[38:50.400 --> 38:50.980]  Going for Geoff.
[38:51.320 --> 38:52.840]  Alright, remember...
[38:52.840 --> 38:54.040]  Uh, time for healsies.
[38:54.840 --> 38:55.220]  Yep.
[38:56.840 --> 38:59.620]  There's also some down here in this, uh...
[38:59.620 --> 39:00.260]  Behind us, Andrew.
[39:00.540 --> 39:01.380]  What would you call this?
[39:01.960 --> 39:02.280]  Kiosk?
[39:03.980 --> 39:04.560]  Thank you.
[39:04.600 --> 39:05.340]  Behind me, on me.
[39:05.800 --> 39:06.300]  Damn it.
[39:06.400 --> 39:06.580]  Sorry.
[39:08.540 --> 39:09.300]  Alright, I'm coming up.
[39:09.480 --> 39:10.080]  Oh, fuck, I fell.
[39:11.020 --> 39:11.540]  Oh, fuck.
[39:11.860 --> 39:12.420]  You okay?
[39:14.920 --> 39:15.360]  Here, Geoff.
[39:15.700 --> 39:16.240]  Oh, damn.
[39:16.380 --> 39:17.040]  Of course you're right there.
[39:17.360 --> 39:18.560]  Oh, I almost fell off the whole thing.
[39:18.560 --> 39:19.000]  Oh, boy.
[39:19.020 --> 39:19.340]  Jesus.
[39:20.620 --> 39:21.560]  We just got a few more.
[39:21.560 --> 39:22.520]  Alright, you guys get those, too.
[39:22.600 --> 39:23.980]  I gotta heal, I gotta heal, I gotta heal.
[39:24.280 --> 39:24.920]  Yeah, get the forwards.
[39:25.140 --> 39:25.540]  Oh, hell yeah, Nicky.
[39:25.600 --> 39:26.440]  Where's the healing?
[39:26.600 --> 39:27.080]  Where's the health?
[39:28.280 --> 39:29.640]  Where the hell did that come from?
[39:29.820 --> 39:30.400]  In the gazebo, near the car.
[39:30.480 --> 39:30.520]  Yeah.
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.300]  In the gazebo, where the, uh...
[39:32.300 --> 39:33.300]  Where the ammo is?
[39:33.460 --> 39:33.520]  I see, I see, I see.
[39:33.540 --> 39:34.060]  The tank was.
[39:34.240 --> 39:36.240]  Oh, charger and a hunter!
[39:36.800 --> 39:37.440]  Double whammy!
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.240]  Holy shit!
[39:38.480 --> 39:39.320]  I'm being hunted, and I'm down.
[39:40.260 --> 39:40.780]  Oh, God.
[39:41.140 --> 39:41.740]  Shit, shit.
[39:41.820 --> 39:42.820]  I got the hunter, I got the hunter, Gavin.
[39:43.000 --> 39:43.340]  Thank you.
[39:43.540 --> 39:44.220]  Geoff, I'm coming for you.
[39:44.340 --> 39:45.080]  There's nobody around me, I'm clear.
[39:45.080 --> 39:45.820]  Oh, there's a jockey.
[39:45.940 --> 39:46.260]  Shit.
[39:47.380 --> 39:48.020]  Get off me, you twat.
[39:48.020 --> 39:50.140]  Totally clear downstairs, next to the health.
[39:51.720 --> 39:52.380]  I'm slow now.
[39:52.380 --> 39:53.080]  Not today, jockey.
[39:53.620 --> 39:54.240]  Nobody near me.
[39:54.240 --> 39:54.580]  You got it, you got it.
[39:54.700 --> 39:55.240]  In the world.
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.400]  Easy peasy.
[39:56.680 --> 39:58.400]  I'm going to come get you, I'm going to come get you.
[39:58.700 --> 39:59.640]  I'm just going to pills up.
[39:59.800 --> 40:00.400]  It's not even coming your way.
[40:00.580 --> 40:03.080]  The safest place you could be right now is hanging out with Geoff, down near the box.
[40:03.100 --> 40:03.700]  Coming your way, Geoff.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.320]  I will, as soon as I get Geoff.
[40:09.240 --> 40:10.760]  All right, Geoff, we got company, so if you can...
[40:10.760 --> 40:10.980]  God.
[40:11.540 --> 40:12.440]  And where did those come from?
[40:14.300 --> 40:15.600]  I don't know, it's the safest place in the world.
[40:15.700 --> 40:17.440]  It was, man, until they showed up.
[40:18.620 --> 40:23.480]  I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got,
[40:53.660 --> 40:54.420]  It's a speed!
[40:55.880 --> 41:00.100]  I'm getting smoked!
[41:01.280 --> 41:02.880]  I'm like a piece of beef!
[41:04.960 --> 41:06.120]  Good communication, guys.
[41:06.400 --> 41:06.800]  Adrenaline!
[41:06.840 --> 41:07.740]  Anyone with de-fibs?
[41:09.620 --> 41:10.340]  Geoff had them.
[41:10.620 --> 41:11.860]  I have one on my corpse.
[41:11.920 --> 41:12.700]  I'm going to speed fill.
[41:12.700 --> 41:13.420]  One on my body.
[41:13.540 --> 41:13.980]  Speed filling.
[41:14.360 --> 41:14.680]  Right there.
[41:14.760 --> 41:15.020]  Ten!
[41:17.040 --> 41:17.520]  Eleven!
[41:19.020 --> 41:19.860]  Come on!
[41:20.100 --> 41:20.340]  Where?
[41:20.500 --> 41:21.020]  Come on!
[41:21.740 --> 41:22.160]  Twelve!
[41:22.160 --> 41:24.560]  The other one's right next to you.
[41:24.560 --> 41:25.980]  Get in there, get in there!
[41:25.980 --> 41:26.860]  Get in the car!
[41:28.080 --> 41:30.020]  Don't worry, don't worry!
[41:30.240 --> 41:31.460]  He's taking his time.
[41:31.700 --> 41:32.620]  I got it!
[41:34.340 --> 41:36.240]  I know where the gas goes!
[41:36.420 --> 41:37.980]  I had to jump the goddamn guardrail!
[41:41.940 --> 41:43.220]  It's a two-seater anyway.
[41:43.960 --> 41:45.880]  Nick and Andrew survived.
[41:46.180 --> 41:46.660]  Congratulations.
[41:47.720 --> 41:49.760]  I died so close to the end.
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.000]  That's unbelievable.
[41:51.420 --> 41:53.700]  Nick and Andrew can repopulate humanity now.
[41:53.780 --> 41:55.860]  I don't know which is which.
[41:56.780 --> 41:57.900]  Geoff and I got incapacitated
[41:58.780 --> 41:59.640]  seven times.
[41:59.660 --> 42:00.900]  Seven times each.
[42:02.100 --> 42:03.720]  Well, I was busy getting
[42:03.720 --> 42:06.040]  set on fire and hit by Andrew through most of it.
[42:06.160 --> 42:07.840]  Bloody adrenaline, Andrew.
[42:07.860 --> 42:09.800]  That is a great exaggeration. We'll see.
[42:09.940 --> 42:11.160]  No wonder I didn't see any adrenaline.
[42:11.340 --> 42:12.920]  Andrew shot up four times.
[42:14.400 --> 42:14.880]  Okay.
[42:15.300 --> 42:18.520]  I have a problem. I didn't know I'd get called out here for it.
[42:19.340 --> 42:20.660]  Nick killed seven
[42:20.660 --> 42:21.340]  jockeys.
[42:21.680 --> 42:23.220]  I hate those little bastards.
[42:24.700 --> 42:26.880]  Fewest friendly fire incidents.
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.220]  What happened with the most?
[42:30.740 --> 42:32.700]  Disturb the witch the most. There you go.
[42:33.020 --> 42:33.540]  Thank you.
[42:34.500 --> 42:35.620]  Revive the most teammates.
[42:35.940 --> 42:37.700]  I'm second for reviving the most teammates.
[42:37.980 --> 42:39.860]  I protected the most teammates.
[42:40.420 --> 42:41.260]  Healed the most teammates.
[42:41.940 --> 42:44.140]  Thank you for my headshots.
[42:45.180 --> 42:45.700]  Wow.
[42:47.280 --> 42:48.560]  We're back, boys.
[42:48.820 --> 42:49.900]  That game's still fun.
[42:50.020 --> 42:51.180]  We're back for blood.
[42:52.900 --> 42:54.220]  Should we wrap this up?
[42:54.360 --> 42:55.580]  Yeah, wrap it up. That was great.
[42:55.760 --> 42:56.780]  Let's absolutely do another level.
[42:58.660 --> 42:59.840]  So much for...
[42:59.840 --> 43:00.900]  Never mind.
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.340]  Just do an outro.
[43:06.760 --> 43:07.880]  What's the problem?
[43:08.020 --> 43:09.580]  Would you believe, audience,
[43:09.800 --> 43:12.520]  that we talk for a living on a podcast
[43:12.520 --> 43:14.120]  without video games?
[43:14.680 --> 43:16.540]  Oh, man.
