[00:00.000 --> 00:04.880]  We were so lucky. I felt it at the time, but it's true, man.
[00:05.480 --> 00:08.540]  We this was we just got to play in this all day long.
[00:09.660 --> 00:10.940]  It was such a gift.
[00:11.220 --> 00:14.340]  And enough time has passed now where I look back on it fondly
[00:14.340 --> 00:16.940]  because I don't remember all the time we wasted trying to deal with
[00:16.940 --> 00:20.640]  all the technical issues of trying to have six people in here all the time
[00:20.640 --> 00:21.460]  and having to...
[00:21.460 --> 00:25.660]  Honestly, Gav, let's take a trip back about 47 minutes
[00:25.660 --> 00:29.360]  to the first 10 minutes of us trying to film this,
[00:29.360 --> 00:32.240]  which was just our skins didn't show up properly,
[00:32.720 --> 00:33.800]  even though we had them.
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.560]  Well, first of all, I had to figure out how to get Master Chief.
[00:35.680 --> 00:36.420]  That was a whole thing.
[00:36.940 --> 00:39.640]  And then and then we put the right skins on
[00:39.640 --> 00:41.400]  and then the game just showed different skins.
[00:41.560 --> 00:42.520]  You were Michael for a while.
[00:42.620 --> 00:43.640]  You were Matt Bragg.
[00:44.300 --> 00:45.980]  I was Steve for a while.
[00:46.020 --> 00:48.460]  It's just like we couldn't get them to appear. And then.
[00:49.440 --> 00:50.680]  Yeah, I don't miss.
[00:51.360 --> 00:54.420]  10 minutes of fighting the game later, here we are.
