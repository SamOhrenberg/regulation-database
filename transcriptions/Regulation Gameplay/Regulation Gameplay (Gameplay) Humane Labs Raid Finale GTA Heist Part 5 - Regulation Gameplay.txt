[00:00.000 --> 00:02.520]  Hello and welcome to another regulation heist.
[00:02.680 --> 00:05.980]  This is the final part of the Humane Labs raid.
[00:06.080 --> 00:06.800]  I am excited.
[00:07.320 --> 00:09.040]  I don't know if I've ever done this before.
[00:09.420 --> 00:11.540]  I think this might be a stealth based one.
[00:12.060 --> 00:13.100]  Oh, we're good at stealth.
[00:13.220 --> 00:13.900]  How are y'all feeling?
[00:14.440 --> 00:14.840]  Stealthing?
[00:15.320 --> 00:17.680]  Geoff's out of town, so we got to do a heist.
[00:18.060 --> 00:18.860]  I'm feeling ready.
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.840]  I think we're all set to go.
[00:20.940 --> 00:22.080]  I think you just got to...
[00:22.080 --> 00:22.840]  I'm hit play. It's launching.
[00:23.600 --> 00:24.600]  Session is launching.
[00:24.980 --> 00:25.380]  I'm ready.
[00:25.540 --> 00:26.420]  Nick, how do you feel?
[00:26.500 --> 00:27.940]  I think that's the most important thing.
[00:28.300 --> 00:29.140]  Am I flying again?
[00:29.900 --> 00:31.140]  I don't know.
[00:31.160 --> 00:32.140]  I think you should.
[00:32.720 --> 00:35.080]  Oh, we have to fly.
[00:35.200 --> 00:36.100]  You're definitely flying.
[00:36.280 --> 00:38.100]  Stop taking my mask off.
[00:39.600 --> 00:40.840]  Oh, you got to keep it on.
[00:41.120 --> 00:41.800]  I try.
[00:42.500 --> 00:43.740]  I yell at him.
[00:44.240 --> 00:45.400]  I punish him.
[00:45.820 --> 00:47.960]  I think I should probably change my outfit
[00:47.960 --> 00:50.920]  because I've been wearing this suit for maybe eight or nine years.
[00:51.460 --> 00:51.720]  Yeah.
[00:52.980 --> 00:53.540]  OK.
[00:53.860 --> 00:55.180]  Oh, Andrew's pilot.
[00:55.840 --> 00:56.160]  Yeah.
[00:56.980 --> 00:58.280]  50% cut for yourself.
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.780]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:00.820 --> 01:03.800]  I think every heist I've ever done, I've been given 5%.
[01:04.720 --> 01:05.080]  Really?
[01:06.240 --> 01:06.980]  So we're going to.
[01:07.020 --> 01:07.520]  I like this.
[01:07.620 --> 01:08.640]  I like 25 all around.
[01:08.780 --> 01:09.440]  I feel good about.
[01:09.860 --> 01:10.300]  I feel good.
[01:10.500 --> 01:11.740]  I'm just going to give Gavin 30.
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.020]  So that way it makes up for the last time.
[01:14.120 --> 01:16.520]  Oh, that's so nice.
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.440]  Now, I will say that's that's so nice.
[01:19.580 --> 01:21.300]  Don't talk about my 50% again, asshole.
[01:21.500 --> 01:24.260]  Yeah, I was going to say there's no way he remembers that.
[01:24.380 --> 01:25.560]  That's what was out of him.
[01:25.580 --> 01:26.460]  So that's really nice of you.
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.060]  There's no fucking chance he remembers that.
[01:29.320 --> 01:29.960]  That's great.
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.040]  What if I want and what if I want you to have 30% Andrew?
[01:33.880 --> 01:34.200]  Wow.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.420]  I'll take you make more sense.
[01:38.520 --> 01:39.620]  OK, you take 20. Yeah.
[01:40.980 --> 01:41.300]  Wow.
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.740]  Last time you took 20, it was a whole fucking deal.
[01:43.740 --> 01:45.280]  You can give me the extra 5% if you want.
[01:45.880 --> 01:46.720]  Yeah, I'll take it. I'm good.
[01:47.580 --> 01:49.060]  But you have to put it somewhere, right?
[01:49.140 --> 01:49.540]  There you go.
[01:50.100 --> 01:52.540]  OK, this just goes to the tax man IRS.
[01:53.580 --> 01:54.400]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54.400 --> 01:56.580]  That's what we're concerned about is the IRS on this thing.
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.480]  File or heisting.
[01:59.580 --> 02:00.820]  Yeah, go to the Valkyrie.
[02:01.360 --> 02:02.160]  Parachute down.
[02:02.540 --> 02:04.600]  Oh, yeah. Hold off security.
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.080]  Look for the flare.
[02:06.540 --> 02:09.620]  I got blow up the control panel to open the door.
[02:09.980 --> 02:11.320]  Make your way through the facility.
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.880]  Go to the keypad. Go to the elevator.
[02:13.000 --> 02:13.760]  Go to the cooling tunnel.
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.340]  Exit through the tunnel and regroup at the beach or create a signal flare.
[02:16.440 --> 02:16.780]  Whoa.
[02:16.940 --> 02:18.920]  Oh, wait, how do I make Nick the pilot?
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.080]  Can I adjust that from here?
[02:20.400 --> 02:22.560]  Oh, no, I.
[02:22.560 --> 02:24.720]  Oh, yeah, we can adjust who we are.
[02:24.900 --> 02:28.140]  Oh, and on your role.
[02:28.980 --> 02:29.440]  Oh, OK.
[02:29.900 --> 02:31.060]  I'm ground team.
[02:32.220 --> 02:33.260]  I'm going to.
[02:34.080 --> 02:34.940]  How do you switch that?
[02:35.020 --> 02:36.080]  I'm going to kill people.
[02:37.160 --> 02:38.340]  Or maybe can I do it?
[02:38.400 --> 02:39.120]  I think you do it.
[02:39.200 --> 02:39.960]  Yeah, I can. OK.
[02:40.160 --> 02:40.580]  Oh, OK.
[02:40.680 --> 02:41.340]  Nick's the pilot.
[02:41.600 --> 02:43.020]  OK, ground team one.
[02:43.680 --> 02:45.360]  Well, Eric, how about we make we go?
[02:45.360 --> 02:46.280]  I don't want to be the pilot.
[02:46.660 --> 02:47.720]  I don't want to be the pilot.
[02:48.980 --> 02:50.760]  I don't want to be the pilot.
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.080]  I mean, I don't want to be the pilot either, but.
[02:55.220 --> 02:55.900]  Well, what is it?
[02:55.980 --> 02:57.120]  What is what's going on?
[02:57.220 --> 02:58.060]  OK, Andrew, are you OK?
[02:58.740 --> 02:59.240]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:59.400 --> 02:59.700]  I'm ready.
[02:59.860 --> 03:01.100]  Me and Andrew are gunners.
[03:01.480 --> 03:03.020]  Gavin. OK, now we go.
[03:03.140 --> 03:03.960]  Team, team.
[03:04.180 --> 03:04.760]  You got this.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.620]  Are you sure you're set?
[03:06.020 --> 03:06.800]  Oh, whoa.
[03:06.900 --> 03:08.100]  Are we teamed? Is Team Tape back?
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.720]  Team Tape's back again.
[03:09.840 --> 03:10.740]  Team Tape's back?
[03:11.180 --> 03:12.000]  Team No Bad Ideas.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.080]  Holy shit.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.000]  Dude, Team Tape.
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.680]  Team Tape, one time, two videos ago.
[03:18.680 --> 03:20.920]  We're back. We're so fucking back, baby.
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.020]  I'm not sure how hard to hit Team Tape because the video,
[03:24.100 --> 03:26.800]  we wouldn't stop talking about Team Tape hasn't come out yet.
[03:28.220 --> 03:29.840]  Might have found it very annoying.
[03:30.220 --> 03:32.000]  Yeah, people might be against Team Tape.
[03:32.120 --> 03:33.580]  OK, how do we start? OK, there we go.
[03:34.080 --> 03:34.640]  All right, here we go.
[03:34.700 --> 03:36.300]  Let's see. Outfit style, heavy combat outfit.
[03:36.380 --> 03:37.520]  How do I change my mask?
[03:38.040 --> 03:39.120]  Oh, I'm looking sharp.
[03:39.660 --> 03:40.400]  I don't want to be sharp.
[03:40.720 --> 03:41.240]  I like sharp.
[03:41.600 --> 03:42.760]  I don't see tape on the.
[03:43.240 --> 03:43.900]  That's OK, though.
[03:44.380 --> 03:45.060]  Suit and tape.
[03:46.060 --> 03:48.160]  Yeah, as long as I got my suit and tape.
[03:48.680 --> 03:49.760]  I think we look good, dude.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.760]  The ground team's ready to fucking rock and roll.
[03:52.060 --> 03:52.640]  This rocks.
[03:53.200 --> 03:54.140]  Andrew, are we taking to the skies?
[03:54.420 --> 03:54.940]  Let's do this.
[03:54.980 --> 03:56.660]  Let's fucking go in the skies, Nick.
[03:57.020 --> 04:01.360]  So Andrew is the gunner for the like helicopter or plane or something?
[04:01.680 --> 04:01.960]  Is that what's happening?
[04:01.960 --> 04:02.900]  I guess so. Yeah.
[04:02.980 --> 04:04.360]  I got a parachute in or something.
[04:04.440 --> 04:04.800]  I don't know.
[04:05.060 --> 04:07.460]  It's I got to get me a pair of these like piano shoes.
[04:08.640 --> 04:09.240]  Oh, yeah.
[04:09.620 --> 04:10.340]  Piano shoes?
[04:10.800 --> 04:11.580]  What's the name of them?
[04:12.100 --> 04:13.860]  Well, it's just like shoes with spats, right?
[04:13.940 --> 04:15.300]  Isn't that what it's not all it is?
[04:15.400 --> 04:16.680]  Well, I got my gun out already.
[04:16.680 --> 04:17.480]  Me too.
[04:19.160 --> 04:19.640]  All right.
[04:19.700 --> 04:21.460]  Me and you, I guess, Gavin.
[04:22.040 --> 04:25.860]  I thought I made I bought this car the day GT online turned.
[04:26.880 --> 04:28.880]  It's like an 11 year old car.
[04:29.100 --> 04:29.780]  That rocks.
[04:29.960 --> 04:30.560]  That's so cool.
[04:32.480 --> 04:33.140]  All right.
[04:33.240 --> 04:33.500]  All right.
[04:33.520 --> 04:34.040]  Where to, lads?
[04:34.720 --> 04:35.400]  Where's the Valkyrie at?
[04:35.900 --> 04:37.360]  Let me have a look.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.080]  Eric, you want to throw me down a little?
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.660]  I am. I'm doing it right now.
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.160]  I don't know where it's at.
[04:43.880 --> 04:44.540]  Oh, it's up here.
[04:44.580 --> 04:45.180]  It's up here. It's up here.
[04:45.180 --> 04:46.140]  I got you.
[04:46.680 --> 04:47.040]  Nice.
[04:49.980 --> 04:50.500]  I'm right.
[04:50.580 --> 04:54.180]  He's telling you the recommendation earlier of going to high frame rate.
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.420]  This is crazy.
[04:55.640 --> 04:56.320]  It's weird, right?
[04:56.420 --> 04:57.600]  You like the extra frames?
[04:58.060 --> 04:59.900]  Oh, I always love the extra frames.
[05:00.060 --> 05:00.540]  That's pretty good.
[05:01.500 --> 05:02.920]  Oh, that's like I do it.
[05:03.400 --> 05:04.440]  Yeah, he shouldn't have done that.
[05:04.780 --> 05:05.540]  It's a nice area.
[05:06.040 --> 05:06.200]  Yeah.
[05:06.740 --> 05:07.800]  Didn't even use a blinker.
[05:08.000 --> 05:08.520]  Come on, man.
[05:08.820 --> 05:11.180]  You ever tried to get an Uber up in these hills in real life?
[05:11.420 --> 05:12.760]  The real freaking pain in the ass.
[05:13.400 --> 05:14.540]  They don't want to go that far.
[05:17.260 --> 05:18.360]  Oh, wait, you can't.
[05:18.400 --> 05:19.040]  Oh, my God.
[05:19.340 --> 05:22.040]  Gavin, you did such a good job of avoiding that car and it went.
[05:22.220 --> 05:22.380]  I tried.
[05:22.380 --> 05:24.260]  Did not want you to avoid the car.
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.780]  Oh, Nick.
[05:26.880 --> 05:28.120]  OK, I was looking behind.
[05:28.220 --> 05:28.980]  Now we're falling apart.
[05:29.740 --> 05:32.940]  See, what I thought is I would have the acceleration just to never hit that guy.
[05:32.980 --> 05:36.120]  And I really don't in this front wheel car.
[05:39.360 --> 05:40.520]  Here we go.
[05:41.060 --> 05:42.160]  Oh, now we're getting some speed.
[05:42.740 --> 05:43.580]  Yeah, we're going downhill.
[05:44.080 --> 05:44.920]  Oh, that's a tree.
[05:46.300 --> 05:46.860]  Oh, no.
[05:51.140 --> 05:51.420]  Oh,
[05:51.620 --> 05:52.920]  OK, there goes Nick.
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.640]  Oh, I think you missed the turn.
[05:55.200 --> 05:56.500]  Yeah, I want to come down the mountain, though.
[05:56.700 --> 05:57.840]  I don't think we'll lose that much time.
[05:58.080 --> 05:59.920]  Coming down the mountain.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.400]  And then you're supposed to go.
[06:02.680 --> 06:04.040]  I think there's a little jump here.
[06:04.380 --> 06:05.740]  I don't know if you can see this jump.
[06:06.520 --> 06:07.300]  Oh, I can see it.
[06:08.180 --> 06:09.180]  Sit. Oh, God.
[06:09.740 --> 06:10.300]  Good corkscrew.
[06:10.640 --> 06:14.100]  But there's a little bit more upward than I was expecting.
[06:14.380 --> 06:14.920]  All right.
[06:16.600 --> 06:18.440]  Oh, I think we may lose time.
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.920]  Oh, Andrew, I stuck.
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.780]  I got stuck in a tree.
[06:25.360 --> 06:27.160]  You OK? I'm good.
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.320]  I'm free. OK, OK.
[06:28.380 --> 06:29.560]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[06:29.720 --> 06:30.080]  Come back.
[06:30.700 --> 06:31.300]  No, this is fine.
[06:32.160 --> 06:33.120]  Wow. That's pretty great.
[06:34.620 --> 06:35.420]  The trees.
[06:36.660 --> 06:37.540]  Oh, that's trees.
[06:38.180 --> 06:39.220]  Oh, Mike.
[06:39.520 --> 06:40.820]  You almost hit Nick, that was cool.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.240]  Oh, Nick hit that motorcycle.
[06:44.920 --> 06:45.960]  That was awesome.
[06:46.400 --> 06:47.220]  I didn't hit him hard enough.
[06:48.480 --> 06:48.860]  Another one.
[06:49.200 --> 06:50.900]  Shortcut. Nice shortcut.
[06:51.840 --> 06:53.820]  Nick wishes he knew about this shortcut.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.040]  Oh, you wanted it so bad.
[06:59.420 --> 07:01.800]  You, you saw that?
[07:01.920 --> 07:03.060]  I wonder if we'll make it over this.
[07:03.300 --> 07:06.440]  Oh, Gavin tried to have us ford the river.
[07:06.440 --> 07:07.620]  Look, I made it.
[07:07.680 --> 07:08.280]  Come on, fellas.
[07:10.020 --> 07:12.760]  OK, OK, we're coming.
[07:13.540 --> 07:14.980]  Hey, I might be stuck on a rock.
[07:15.380 --> 07:15.880]  Oh, no.
[07:16.320 --> 07:17.500]  We'll give you a good kick in.
[07:18.060 --> 07:18.400]  All right.
[07:20.220 --> 07:20.940]  There you go.
[07:21.480 --> 07:23.200]  Oh, yeah, you're perfect. Get in.
[07:28.750 --> 07:29.870]  How's it going up there, Andrew?
[07:29.930 --> 07:30.570]  Not the water.
[07:30.990 --> 07:31.190]  Good.
[07:31.990 --> 07:33.810]  Why did you go in the water?
[07:34.470 --> 07:35.410]  That was insane.
[07:35.410 --> 07:38.830]  What? You just had to go straight.
[07:41.070 --> 07:43.090]  Why did you go in the water?
[07:43.830 --> 07:44.530]  No bad ideas.
[07:45.950 --> 07:47.410]  What was that about, Nick?
[07:47.410 --> 07:48.210]  What happened?
[07:49.170 --> 07:50.110]  I don't know.
[07:50.630 --> 07:51.890]  What do you mean you don't know?
[07:51.970 --> 07:52.870]  You did it.
[07:53.370 --> 07:55.630]  I had Gavin said something that I just drove into the water.
[07:55.630 --> 07:58.810]  That wasn't, hey, hey, the other time, the other times.
[07:59.050 --> 07:59.630]  Blame Gavin.
[07:59.830 --> 08:00.630]  That one's on you.
[08:00.770 --> 08:01.930]  You're a psychopath.
[08:02.530 --> 08:02.750]  Oh,
[08:05.330 --> 08:06.250]  but my bad
[08:07.130 --> 08:12.010]  to cause bend in the same way back into the water.
[08:12.490 --> 08:13.630]  There was no way to go forward.
[08:13.730 --> 08:16.510]  I had to reverse to go forward, but I went a little too fast.
[08:16.510 --> 08:17.790]  So that's on me.
[08:18.050 --> 08:20.630]  You went fast and straight for a while.
[08:23.110 --> 08:24.510]  Hey, how's it going over there, Andrew?
[08:25.090 --> 08:25.950]  Oh, it's good.
[08:26.090 --> 08:27.310]  OK, cool. I'm almost there.
[08:27.430 --> 08:28.370]  Good. That's great.
[08:28.710 --> 08:31.590]  Clear. Oh, no problem.
[08:32.090 --> 08:32.830]  Why did you?
[08:34.050 --> 08:37.150]  Can I become a CEO in the middle of the heist or not?
[08:37.910 --> 08:39.330]  Are you trying to fire Nick?
[08:39.970 --> 08:42.130]  No, I'm trying to just spawn a helicopter.
[08:44.110 --> 08:45.990]  Oh, OK, well, I'm here.
[08:46.430 --> 08:50.050]  OK, well, you're going to have to give us about 15 fucking minutes.
[08:50.610 --> 08:53.630]  It's oh, no, we got a whole crew waiting over here.
[08:53.970 --> 08:56.050]  OK, tell them to wait also.
[08:56.770 --> 08:59.050]  Unless you just grab the Valkyrie and pick us up at it.
[08:59.750 --> 09:00.990]  We had some car trouble.
[09:01.650 --> 09:03.870]  Yeah, we had some to us.
[09:04.270 --> 09:07.210]  No, I won't let me fly because I'm.
[09:07.310 --> 09:08.550]  Yeah, because Nick is the pilot.
[09:09.070 --> 09:10.830]  Yeah. You don't have the credentials.
[09:11.210 --> 09:12.930]  I don't. I don't have the license.
[09:13.450 --> 09:15.790]  We had some car troubles.
[09:16.230 --> 09:17.650]  We did. Yeah.
[09:18.750 --> 09:19.730]  We had two cars.
[09:20.370 --> 09:21.810]  We had some Nick troubles.
[09:22.710 --> 09:25.770]  I've learned that dysfunctional achievement hunter was actually
[09:25.770 --> 09:27.630]  pretty damn functional in comparison.
[09:28.190 --> 09:28.910]  God damn.
[09:30.070 --> 09:31.290]  All right. I found a car.
[09:31.430 --> 09:32.870]  Let me see if I can get to you guys.
[09:34.890 --> 09:35.870]  Why are you shooting?
[09:35.970 --> 09:37.930]  Why are you trying to get a wanted level?
[09:38.830 --> 09:39.110]  I'm not.
[09:40.470 --> 09:41.330]  Gavin, I'm down here.
[09:41.750 --> 09:42.150]  Oh, shit.
[09:42.830 --> 09:43.450]  Gavin, I'm right here.
[09:43.610 --> 09:44.750]  Just a reminder. No lives.
[09:45.190 --> 09:46.550]  Yeah. Yeah.
[09:46.990 --> 09:47.390]  It's a bird.
[09:48.130 --> 09:48.690]  It's a bird.
[09:51.310 --> 09:52.350]  Oh, it lived.
[09:53.350 --> 09:54.290]  Oh, where is it?
[09:55.030 --> 09:55.910]  You shot it. It's dead.
[09:55.910 --> 09:56.910]  Here, get in.
[09:59.490 --> 10:00.290]  Oh, you're great.
[10:00.430 --> 10:01.850]  You're getting in with Nick is nuts.
[10:03.470 --> 10:04.570]  Well, I didn't really.
[10:05.230 --> 10:06.450]  OK, I'm good.
[10:08.270 --> 10:09.550]  OK, I'm the pilot.
[10:10.950 --> 10:11.730]  Yeah, you are a pilot.
[10:12.810 --> 10:13.290]  That's right.
[10:14.510 --> 10:16.230]  I'm Randy Quaid from Independence Day.
[10:20.660 --> 10:24.520]  Driving it, driving it right into the river was so fucking crazy.
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.660]  That was insane.
[10:25.660 --> 10:27.600]  It was I Randy Quaid from it.
[10:27.640 --> 10:28.340]  We just started.
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.600]  It just started.
[10:29.700 --> 10:31.060]  We just turned the game on.
[10:31.420 --> 10:32.500]  I was abducted.
[10:32.620 --> 10:36.440]  Why didn't Randy Quaid hit the jet right before he crashed into the spaceship?
[10:37.380 --> 10:40.120]  Well, you would have shot right up into the spaceship, wouldn't he?
[10:40.620 --> 10:41.840]  No, I don't want to look cooler.
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.260]  I'm back.
[10:45.040 --> 10:46.960]  And then just ejected into it.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.620]  Or he could have just 180 and jetpacked downwards.
[10:52.360 --> 10:52.960]  That's true.
[10:54.660 --> 10:57.240]  Oh, that would be if he's just spun it.
[10:58.080 --> 10:59.500]  I'm giving you a wide berth there.
[10:59.600 --> 10:59.980]  Don't worry.
[11:00.220 --> 11:01.620]  I didn't say a word.
[11:02.080 --> 11:03.800]  I didn't say a word about this part of it.
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.900]  I could feel it coming through the Internet.
[11:07.280 --> 11:07.760]  How are you feeling?
[11:08.780 --> 11:09.140]  All right.
[11:09.580 --> 11:10.400]  You have the need for speed.
[11:11.720 --> 11:13.620]  Who are you talking to?
[11:14.620 --> 11:16.480]  Who do you want me to be talking to in this?
[11:17.240 --> 11:17.640]  Nobody.
[11:18.280 --> 11:22.600]  There was no context clues to who that was aimed at, like based on where the
[11:22.600 --> 11:23.980]  conversation ended.
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.140]  I thought your kid walked into the room.
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.660]  No, he's at school.
[11:29.380 --> 11:31.740]  I was talking to you.
[11:32.120 --> 11:33.780]  You were talking to me?
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.060]  Excuse me.
[11:37.300 --> 11:38.600]  Pilot coming through.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.400]  Oh, God.
[11:44.940 --> 11:46.820]  Why did you go that way?
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.460]  Why'd you have to wreck my suit?
[11:52.060 --> 11:53.100]  Are we all getting in?
[11:53.200 --> 11:53.720]  Is that the?
[11:54.160 --> 11:55.280]  Yeah, you're going to parachute out.
[11:55.400 --> 11:55.740]  OK.
[11:58.740 --> 12:01.060]  Oh, oh, God, I was close.
[12:02.420 --> 12:03.660]  Up we go.
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.160]  Let's go to the drop zone.
[12:05.340 --> 12:06.660]  To the drop zone.
[12:08.040 --> 12:10.020]  Press Y to look through the camera.
[12:11.620 --> 12:13.080]  I almost did it.
[12:15.200 --> 12:16.820]  Why would you look into the camera?
[12:20.260 --> 12:21.360]  Oh, I need to be high up.
[12:21.440 --> 12:23.640]  OK, look at Nick flying this thing.
[12:24.200 --> 12:24.680]  Look at this.
[12:25.120 --> 12:27.220]  Great, Nick, you're killing this.
[12:27.460 --> 12:28.060]  Hey, thanks, man.
[12:29.100 --> 12:30.240]  Gavin, you've done this before, right?
[12:31.180 --> 12:32.180]  Oh, multiple times.
[12:33.120 --> 12:35.780]  What what thing do you usually do when you do this?
[12:36.920 --> 12:38.580]  Oh, you want me to remember what happens in this?
[12:39.940 --> 12:40.700]  That's why I was.
[12:41.140 --> 12:43.880]  I mean, that's why I was asking that sort of the setup to the question.
[12:44.060 --> 12:45.540]  Shit out of luck, I'm afraid with that.
[12:46.140 --> 12:47.760]  It's been multiple years.
[12:48.660 --> 12:49.460]  Oh, OK.
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.580]  And multiple times.
[12:53.160 --> 12:56.100]  Yeah, but that was like a whole pandemic in the middle of it.
[12:56.540 --> 12:57.340]  That's true.
[12:57.580 --> 12:58.100]  In between.
[12:58.900 --> 13:00.180]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:00.620 --> 13:00.920]  All right.
[13:01.320 --> 13:03.740]  It's got to hit that little gold circle there.
[13:05.480 --> 13:06.280]  Oh, OK.
[13:06.500 --> 13:07.520]  Oh, he OK.
[13:08.020 --> 13:08.720]  I mean, he jumped.
[13:08.780 --> 13:09.540]  Are we supposed to? OK.
[13:09.900 --> 13:11.120]  Yeah, you're supposed to jump, too.
[13:11.120 --> 13:11.540]  Is that all right?
[13:12.320 --> 13:13.100]  No, we're good.
[13:14.560 --> 13:15.440]  They're OK. Shut down.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.080]  Let's land on the car park.
[13:17.080 --> 13:20.060]  Let's land exactly on the little dock.
[13:21.160 --> 13:23.100]  I I pulled. I got nervous.
[13:23.580 --> 13:24.340]  OK, parachute.
[13:24.660 --> 13:25.660]  I got very nervous.
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.740]  Oh, my shoe didn't have it died.
[13:31.220 --> 13:32.940]  What did you do?
[13:33.520 --> 13:35.340]  That was my president.
[13:35.580 --> 13:36.480]  Nothing happened.
[13:37.260 --> 13:37.920]  Unbelievable.
[13:38.040 --> 13:41.740]  I didn't even see my arm like reach for where we check pointing.
[13:43.400 --> 13:45.920]  Gavin, it's going to be at the chopper.
[13:46.880 --> 13:47.520]  Is it?
[13:48.440 --> 13:49.900]  It better be at the chopper.
[13:50.300 --> 13:50.940]  Is it?
[13:51.080 --> 13:53.000]  I'm pulling my shoe like a minute early.
[13:54.260 --> 13:56.040]  Yeah, I was telling it.
[13:57.960 --> 13:58.760]  OK, we're at the top.
[13:59.000 --> 13:59.340]  We're at the top.
[13:59.420 --> 14:01.320]  How many times do I get to fly this chopper back?
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.620]  Am I supposed to hop out?
[14:03.680 --> 14:04.700]  I'm supposed to stay, right?
[14:04.820 --> 14:05.720]  You stay. You're supposed to stay.
[14:05.920 --> 14:07.400]  You're you're in the gunner seat.
[14:07.480 --> 14:10.600]  You're supposed to shoot a bunch of guys when it starts getting fucking hairy.
[14:11.360 --> 14:12.760]  Yeah. Let me get in the gunner's seat.
[14:12.860 --> 14:13.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[14:13.360 --> 14:13.920]  Get in the front.
[14:14.040 --> 14:15.160]  I was I thought was crazy.
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.000]  You got in the back, but it just kept defaulting me.
[14:18.320 --> 14:20.140]  Well, probably because I wasn't in it yet, maybe.
[14:20.800 --> 14:22.180]  All right. OK, here we go.
[14:22.380 --> 14:23.240]  Me and you. All right. Ready?
[14:23.820 --> 14:24.700]  Let's do this.
[14:24.980 --> 14:25.660]  Round two.
[14:26.260 --> 14:27.180]  I can't believe you.
[14:27.320 --> 14:29.840]  All of a sudden I'm like, all right, I got to be really careful.
[14:30.180 --> 14:31.660]  I'm nervous about this parachute.
[14:32.440 --> 14:33.620]  Gavin died. OK, cool.
[14:34.740 --> 14:36.460]  Well, it turns out he wasn't nervous enough.
[14:36.860 --> 14:40.620]  The premise that he thinks that you're supposed to wait till the last minute.
[14:40.860 --> 14:41.140]  Pull it.
[14:41.140 --> 14:45.140]  I was like, next time I'll do it minutes before.
[14:45.360 --> 14:46.560]  It's like, yeah, that's how you do that.
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.800]  I was I was going for Halo.
[14:47.880 --> 14:49.420]  I was trying to be James Bond.
[14:50.460 --> 14:51.520]  How did that work? What's wrong?
[14:51.840 --> 14:53.240]  That felt really close.
[14:53.700 --> 14:58.060]  So I felt like to me, from my perspective, you were like an inch above the telephone.
[14:58.300 --> 14:59.340]  Oh, no, we were way above it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.340]  How close did you get to the top of this hill?
[15:04.300 --> 15:04.920]  Ignore him.
[15:05.420 --> 15:07.580]  We need air for them to fall to their death.
[15:08.640 --> 15:09.800]  Oh, you know what? He's right.
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.080]  Pull up, pull up.
[15:11.920 --> 15:12.580]  I don't know why.
[15:12.720 --> 15:14.180]  The whole thing is go high.
[15:14.280 --> 15:15.380]  Why are you so low?
[15:16.220 --> 15:17.800]  You've seen how close I can get to the mountain.
[15:18.180 --> 15:19.240]  Oh, my God.
[15:20.220 --> 15:20.900]  Gavin said it.
[15:22.740 --> 15:25.240]  Yeah, that's why I screamed, oh, my God.
[15:25.780 --> 15:26.500]  Right. Gavin.
[15:26.620 --> 15:29.260]  I feel like it defeats the purpose of dropping from high
[15:29.260 --> 15:32.880]  when you arrive at like 50 feet above the buildings and then go up.
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.440]  I mean, it didn't trip the alarm,
[15:36.440 --> 15:39.040]  but you're probably right.
[15:40.180 --> 15:43.520]  Like, oh, what's that black ops helicopter doing up there?
[15:44.780 --> 15:45.980]  All right, fellas, have fun.
[15:46.540 --> 15:47.680]  All right, Gavin, jump in.
[15:48.180 --> 15:50.820]  On three. One, two, three.
[15:53.760 --> 15:55.420]  All right, Eric, I'm looking at you.
[15:55.480 --> 15:56.500]  Tell me when to open my chute.
[15:56.960 --> 15:57.460]  All right, everybody.
[15:57.980 --> 15:58.680]  I'm diving.
[16:00.900 --> 16:02.040]  And she's open.
[16:02.400 --> 16:03.620]  Nice and easy, baby.
[16:04.040 --> 16:05.180]  See, that worked perfectly.
[16:05.180 --> 16:06.460]  I don't know how I can do that.
[16:06.600 --> 16:08.140]  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[16:08.200 --> 16:09.520]  I'm really high. I'm really high.
[16:09.560 --> 16:11.560]  I'm really high. I'm really high.
[16:11.860 --> 16:13.140]  High from the roof.
[16:13.480 --> 16:14.000]  What do you mean?
[16:14.140 --> 16:14.760]  You land on the roof.
[16:15.780 --> 16:17.460]  What? Land down here on the right.
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.600]  I'm trying.
[16:20.120 --> 16:20.760]  Oh, no.
[16:21.380 --> 16:22.940]  How are you going to get down from there, you softy?
[16:22.940 --> 16:23.880]  I don't know.
[16:24.580 --> 16:26.620]  See if you can just bounce off some shit.
[16:26.760 --> 16:28.500]  Like, try and just slough down and you might live.
[16:29.080 --> 16:29.940]  I don't. Yeah.
[16:32.160 --> 16:32.900]  Tuck and roll.
[16:32.900 --> 16:34.640]  OK. OK. OK.
[16:34.680 --> 16:35.440]  It worked. It worked. It worked.
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.280]  It worked. It worked.
[16:36.840 --> 16:37.400]  It worked. It worked.
[16:38.040 --> 16:39.880]  We're still waiting for you to reach the landing.
[16:40.000 --> 16:40.480]  OK, we're here.
[16:41.160 --> 16:42.060]  Night vision on.
[16:42.620 --> 16:44.480]  Eric was just bouncing like a pinball.
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.340]  Yeah. All right.
[16:46.720 --> 16:47.460]  Let's do it, Gavin.
[16:47.940 --> 16:49.420]  All right, so I love the control weapon.
[16:50.080 --> 16:50.760]  Yeah, I got it.
[16:51.180 --> 16:51.900]  I got my suppressor on.
[16:55.860 --> 16:56.500]  Oh, shit.
[16:56.800 --> 16:59.800]  How do we blow the blow the control panel to open the door?
[17:00.400 --> 17:01.260]  I just like shoot it.
[17:02.500 --> 17:03.020]  You got a bomb.
[17:03.580 --> 17:05.780]  You might have to do some pipe dream or whatever.
[17:06.040 --> 17:06.900]  OK, hang on.
[17:08.020 --> 17:08.740]  Proximity mine.
[17:08.880 --> 17:09.560]  I got a sticky.
[17:10.380 --> 17:12.200]  Are you sure you don't just press a D pad on it?
[17:13.680 --> 17:14.700]  No, nothing.
[17:15.400 --> 17:17.260]  Oh, OK.
[17:17.680 --> 17:18.700]  Go for it.
[17:18.760 --> 17:21.680]  OK, it doesn't seem this doesn't seem right, right?
[17:23.100 --> 17:24.040]  Oh, what? You threw a grenade?
[17:24.860 --> 17:25.940]  No, I threw a pipe.
[17:26.040 --> 17:26.660]  I threw a pipe bomb.
[17:27.620 --> 17:28.300]  OK, we're in.
[17:28.700 --> 17:29.980]  OK, careful.
[17:32.800 --> 17:34.800]  Uh, was that us?
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.300]  Doesn't seem like a stealth mission.
[17:42.540 --> 17:43.900]  I don't think we need.
[17:45.480 --> 17:46.800]  Yeah, I don't think we're going to need it.
[17:46.900 --> 17:47.520]  Nice shooting.
[17:48.220 --> 17:49.960]  Sorry, I'm bringing you about.
[17:50.400 --> 17:51.720]  Yeah, if you could turn me left.
[17:52.100 --> 17:52.900]  I got you. Perfect.
[17:54.760 --> 17:55.840]  Oh, a little bit, right?
[17:56.280 --> 17:57.500]  OK, hold on.
[17:57.540 --> 17:58.620]  They're like right under the gate.
[17:58.700 --> 18:00.940]  Let me see if I can swing you around this way.
[18:03.240 --> 18:04.020]  How about that?
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.260]  Does that do anything for you?
[18:07.300 --> 18:09.140]  Uh, yeah, I can make that work.
[18:12.680 --> 18:14.240]  I'm that solo guy.
[18:16.100 --> 18:18.600]  Oh, this is perfect, Nick.
[18:19.260 --> 18:20.180]  Oh, this is nice.
[18:20.340 --> 18:21.380]  Kind of hold this area.
[18:21.620 --> 18:21.660]  Yeah.
[18:24.860 --> 18:25.960]  Watch that right side, Gavin.
[18:26.360 --> 18:27.040]  Oh, shit.
[18:28.060 --> 18:28.500]  Told you.
[18:29.240 --> 18:30.080]  You got him, you got him.
[18:30.400 --> 18:31.160]  You're all right, you're all right.
[18:32.100 --> 18:35.320]  Did I see somewhere that on the weapons wheel you can access your Q's and Q's?
[18:35.320 --> 18:36.720]  Oh, we got a chopper.
[18:36.720 --> 18:37.500]  You got to go up.
[18:37.640 --> 18:37.980]  Yeah.
[18:39.380 --> 18:40.140]  I'm going to try the.
[18:40.420 --> 18:41.560]  There's a guy beneath us, though.
[18:41.640 --> 18:43.240]  Can you take him out in the truck there?
[18:45.480 --> 18:46.380]  Uh, we're OK.
[18:46.440 --> 18:46.780]  We're OK.
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.680]  Yeah, I can't.
[18:49.460 --> 18:50.100]  No, I can't.
[18:50.120 --> 18:51.580]  Nice tactical roll, Gavin.
[18:51.980 --> 18:52.680]  Tactical rolls.
[18:54.660 --> 18:55.580]  Oh, going up.
[18:55.760 --> 18:56.320]  Nice shooting.
[18:56.560 --> 18:57.240]  I got you. I got you.
[18:57.360 --> 18:57.560]  I got you, Gavin.
[18:57.760 --> 18:58.880]  Come back, come back, come back.
[18:59.040 --> 18:59.680]  Helicopter down.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.220]  I might need to start snapping in.
[19:02.340 --> 19:03.120]  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.680]  I'll move up.
[19:04.680 --> 19:05.520]  I'll move up.
[19:06.480 --> 19:07.660]  Yeah, let's get those guys.
[19:09.480 --> 19:10.700]  Where are they at? Where are they at?
[19:10.840 --> 19:12.340]  They're in the lot somewhere here.
[19:13.740 --> 19:14.420]  Give you a.
[19:15.260 --> 19:16.100]  That's one of them.
[19:16.720 --> 19:17.740]  We OK? You good, Gavin?
[19:17.820 --> 19:18.460]  Oh, see ya.
[19:19.040 --> 19:19.740]  To the right.
[19:19.880 --> 19:20.480]  If you turn right.
[19:21.140 --> 19:21.280]  Yeah.
[19:24.540 --> 19:25.260]  Stay frosty.
[19:27.300 --> 19:28.000]  Got one guy.
[19:28.380 --> 19:28.920]  Got the other.
[19:29.200 --> 19:29.700]  Both down.
[19:30.440 --> 19:30.860]  Killed him.
[19:31.880 --> 19:32.660]  Other guys getting up.
[19:32.780 --> 19:33.280]  One guy, one guy.
[19:33.460 --> 19:34.200]  Shooting on the ground still.
[19:34.200 --> 19:35.180]  There he is, there he is.
[19:36.100 --> 19:36.640]  You got him?
[19:37.160 --> 19:37.240]  Yeah.
[19:37.340 --> 19:37.760]  All right, let's move.
[19:37.960 --> 19:38.080]  All right.
[19:38.180 --> 19:39.240]  We'll stay at this altitude.
[19:39.580 --> 19:40.460]  Keep on floating.
[19:40.680 --> 19:41.740]  Remember, just watch your health.
[19:42.700 --> 19:43.280]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[19:44.060 --> 19:44.400]  All right.
[19:44.660 --> 19:45.260]  We got some trucks coming in.
[19:45.260 --> 19:45.880]  That was sick.
[19:46.360 --> 19:47.580]  Careful, careful, careful, careful.
[19:47.660 --> 19:48.000]  Right side.
[19:52.060 --> 19:52.820]  Oh, my God.
[19:53.080 --> 19:54.340]  That is meaty over there.
[19:54.560 --> 19:55.160]  I got him, I got him.
[19:55.380 --> 19:55.900]  Be careful.
[19:56.480 --> 19:57.320]  You want me to take you that way?
[19:57.640 --> 19:58.660]  Oh, shit. Right on top of me.
[19:59.600 --> 20:00.440]  God damn it.
[20:02.500 --> 20:03.120]  I'm sorry.
[20:03.500 --> 20:03.840]  He ran.
[20:03.920 --> 20:05.000]  He ran right up and got me.
[20:05.000 --> 20:05.560]  I'm sorry.
[20:06.040 --> 20:07.760]  He like, he ran past me, turned around.
[20:07.840 --> 20:08.620]  I was already in cover.
[20:09.400 --> 20:10.120]  Sorry about that, guys.
[20:10.220 --> 20:10.740]  It's all good.
[20:10.880 --> 20:11.700]  I feel like that was a good run.
[20:12.200 --> 20:14.800]  Listen, the person you owe the least apology to is me.
[20:16.160 --> 20:16.900]  And we're learning.
[20:17.240 --> 20:17.740]  Yeah, we're learning.
[20:17.940 --> 20:19.060]  I feel good about this.
[20:19.120 --> 20:20.000]  I feel good about where we're at.
[20:20.100 --> 20:21.220]  We know it doesn't have to be stealth.
[20:21.440 --> 20:22.240]  Like, I feel good about this.
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.240]  Yeah, I feel good.
[20:23.380 --> 20:24.260]  Those were your windmills.
[20:24.520 --> 20:25.200]  So let's do this.
[20:26.380 --> 20:26.960]  Not my windmills.
[20:27.720 --> 20:28.760]  I think they're different to the windmills.
[20:28.760 --> 20:29.640]  That is not what that was.
[20:29.720 --> 20:31.100]  I didn't intentionally kill us.
[20:31.500 --> 20:33.020]  I learned from the windmills.
[20:33.080 --> 20:33.460]  You learned from the windmills.
[20:33.460 --> 20:35.660]  Now. Now I'm not going to land on the roof.
[20:36.740 --> 20:38.780]  Oh, see, that was your windmill.
[20:40.380 --> 20:41.920]  Again, you recovered it, though.
[20:41.920 --> 20:45.140]  So I don't think it's it's quite one to one, but.
[20:46.140 --> 20:47.360]  All right, Gavin, count us down.
[20:47.840 --> 20:49.180]  3, 2, 1, hop!
[20:51.360 --> 20:53.480]  And we're going to land in the car park.
[20:54.660 --> 20:55.120]  We're trying.
[21:02.620 --> 21:03.680]  Nice chute pull.
[21:04.640 --> 21:06.840]  I'm gonna pull mine about now.
[21:06.840 --> 21:09.300]  Hey Andrew, what's sky at night? Sailor's Delight.
[21:10.960 --> 21:11.480]  Ohhhhh.
[21:12.440 --> 21:13.260]  Sailor's Delight.
[21:13.760 --> 21:14.600]  I don't know what that means.
[21:14.740 --> 21:15.980]  Nice and easy, look at that!
[21:16.320 --> 21:20.720]  It means that if they're going out to sea tomorrow, good weather.
[21:20.720 --> 21:21.240]  Alright, you wanna blow it up?
[21:21.900 --> 21:22.020]  Yeah.
[21:22.880 --> 21:23.920]  Applying the sticky.
[21:24.700 --> 21:24.900]  Okay.
[21:26.280 --> 21:27.660]  Is that part of the Sailor's Delight?
[21:28.060 --> 21:28.600]  Yep. Let's go.
[21:28.960 --> 21:29.480]  What the?
[21:30.720 --> 21:31.980]  Uh, no.
[21:32.280 --> 21:32.700]  Got one!
[21:32.700 --> 21:35.760]  Because it's red sky at morning, sailors take warnings.
[21:35.940 --> 21:37.680]  It's Shepard, not Sailor.
[21:38.400 --> 21:38.980]  Is it Shepard?
[21:39.340 --> 21:39.600]  Shepard.
[21:40.480 --> 21:41.600]  Maybe it's an English thing.
[21:42.660 --> 21:44.140]  You know us and our Shepards.
[21:44.860 --> 21:45.060]  Yeah.
[21:47.360 --> 21:48.160]  We're learning.
[21:48.840 --> 21:50.680]  I am almost dead, holy shit.
[21:51.100 --> 21:51.300]  What?
[21:51.880 --> 21:54.040]  I went behind cover, my head was visible.
[21:55.260 --> 21:55.780]  Idiot.
[21:55.940 --> 21:57.860]  We gotta get much lower, my missiles ain't reaching.
[21:58.220 --> 21:59.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dropping.
[22:01.820 --> 22:04.280]  Alright, tell me if that's a little better for ya.
[22:04.520 --> 22:04.960]  Way better.
[22:06.280 --> 22:07.420]  Come on, peek out, come on.
[22:08.200 --> 22:08.660]  Got him.
[22:10.000 --> 22:10.320]  Down.
[22:10.960 --> 22:11.660]  Bringin' us about.
[22:11.760 --> 22:12.240]  Kill him!
[22:14.020 --> 22:14.880]  Goddamn, that took forever.
[22:15.380 --> 22:16.060]  Okay, we got him.
[22:16.180 --> 22:16.680]  Alright, let's go.
[22:17.920 --> 22:19.180]  Uh, tactical roll, okay.
[22:20.580 --> 22:20.880]  Good, good.
[22:22.440 --> 22:23.940]  Okay, watch it, guy comin' around, guy comin' around.
[22:24.480 --> 22:25.600]  You got him right there, good work.
[22:26.880 --> 22:28.000]  Man, they got a lot of armor.
[22:28.600 --> 22:28.900]  Yeah.
[22:31.380 --> 22:32.180]  Aw, moron.
[22:32.740 --> 22:35.260]  There he is.
[22:36.140 --> 22:37.200]  I must have a bad gut.
[22:37.220 --> 22:37.980]  Oh, he's still alive.
[22:38.120 --> 22:38.740]  Is he not there?
[22:39.360 --> 22:41.240]  There's guys on the other side here.
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.020]  Oops!
[22:43.360 --> 22:43.620]  Jesus.
[22:43.760 --> 22:44.080]  What happened?
[22:44.380 --> 22:46.620]  I threw a sticky bomb on that door.
[22:47.240 --> 22:47.960]  By accident.
[22:48.700 --> 22:49.200]  Oh my god.
[22:50.760 --> 22:50.900]  Okay.
[22:53.180 --> 22:53.780]  Let's do it.
[22:54.060 --> 22:54.760]  You got him?
[22:54.900 --> 22:55.420]  Just watch your health.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.320]  Poppin' heads, poppin' heads.
[23:00.380 --> 23:00.700]  Got it.
[23:01.240 --> 23:01.560]  Oh!
[23:02.080 --> 23:02.720]  Oh, shit.
[23:03.120 --> 23:03.900]  We're okay, we're alright.
[23:03.900 --> 23:04.560]  What happened to you guys?
[23:05.220 --> 23:06.240]  We got hit by a missile.
[23:06.560 --> 23:06.900]  We did.
[23:08.600 --> 23:09.700]  Alright, Gavin, we're good, we're good.
[23:10.060 --> 23:12.840]  Alright, I'm gonna do a sideways, rightwards roll.
[23:13.340 --> 23:13.540]  Yeah!
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.200]  Okay, there's one.
[23:19.780 --> 23:20.880]  Got him, got him, got him, got him.
[23:20.920 --> 23:21.580]  There's two.
[23:21.940 --> 23:22.700]  Still one guy at the back.
[23:23.040 --> 23:24.420]  Yeah, yeah, I'm moving up to cover.
[23:26.140 --> 23:26.540]  He down?
[23:27.180 --> 23:27.940]  Oh, he's down, cool.
[23:28.080 --> 23:28.360]  We're good.
[23:28.600 --> 23:28.760]  Yep.
[23:30.380 --> 23:32.240]  Reload, heal up.
[23:35.400 --> 23:36.780]  Yeah, I could do with some armor.
[23:37.020 --> 23:37.560]  Hold on a sec.
[23:39.340 --> 23:39.920]  Oh, fuck.
[23:40.060 --> 23:41.720]  They're, like, all around that corner.
[23:45.840 --> 23:46.560]  Oh, shit!
[23:47.540 --> 23:48.240]  They ran at me.
[23:48.700 --> 23:50.560]  That's the same thing that happened to me last time.
[23:51.940 --> 23:52.720]  Okay, those guys are down.
[23:57.360 --> 23:57.900]  Nice shoot.
[23:57.940 --> 23:59.220]  We got two helicopters coming.
[23:59.540 --> 24:00.060]  Okay, we're good.
[24:00.060 --> 24:00.800]  I'll take us up.
[24:00.980 --> 24:02.440]  Oh, shit, you have a bomb?
[24:02.440 --> 24:03.220]  What are you doing?
[24:03.660 --> 24:05.680]  I'm trying to coax him around so I can det him.
[24:06.320 --> 24:08.300]  I think I can just go out there and get him.
[24:09.080 --> 24:09.440]  Okay.
[24:11.880 --> 24:13.140]  That was a move, Nick.
[24:14.140 --> 24:15.280]  I wanted to get above him.
[24:16.460 --> 24:17.500]  Okay, got one down.
[24:18.280 --> 24:19.660]  Now we got two below us.
[24:19.940 --> 24:20.080]  Yeah.
[24:20.280 --> 24:20.820]  Okay, got him.
[24:21.260 --> 24:21.840]  Okay, I think we're good.
[24:26.510 --> 24:27.230]  Moving up.
[24:29.650 --> 24:30.350]  That's one.
[24:30.350 --> 24:31.350]  Nice shot.
[24:31.990 --> 24:32.850]  And there's the other.
[24:33.030 --> 24:33.370]  Okay, we're good.
[24:34.430 --> 24:35.010]  Okay, nice.
[24:35.010 --> 24:36.070]  How did he...
[24:36.070 --> 24:37.570]  He ate, like, five of those.
[24:37.730 --> 24:38.210]  Are we going down here?
[24:38.530 --> 24:38.970]  Oh, it's over here.
[24:39.530 --> 24:39.770]  Okay.
[24:41.450 --> 24:42.870]  Got a bunch of guys in here.
[24:43.450 --> 24:44.190]  Bunch of guys in here.
[24:44.190 --> 24:44.810]  Should I throw a grenade?
[24:45.570 --> 24:46.290]  Uh, no.
[24:46.870 --> 24:48.970]  Well, if you can get through there, maybe you can.
[24:49.190 --> 24:49.690]  But be careful.
[24:49.690 --> 24:50.150]  Check this out.
[24:50.770 --> 24:50.990]  Okay.
[24:52.530 --> 24:52.890]  No!
[24:53.270 --> 24:54.190]  Oh, my God.
[24:54.750 --> 24:56.430]  Oh, you're trying to get him to walk through.
[24:57.330 --> 24:58.830]  No, I was trying to destroy them.
[25:00.070 --> 25:01.910]  It sucked to the door frame.
[25:01.950 --> 25:02.830]  Yes, it did.
[25:05.530 --> 25:06.450]  Alright, let's be careful with that.
[25:06.470 --> 25:06.690]  Headshot.
[25:06.970 --> 25:07.330]  Nice.
[25:08.350 --> 25:09.930]  Just don't blow it up, and you're fine.
[25:11.810 --> 25:14.710]  Compared to where I was aiming, it was insane that that's where that went.
[25:14.830 --> 25:16.310]  Sorry, I'm trying to keep you steady without dying.
[25:16.430 --> 25:16.550]  Okay.
[25:16.950 --> 25:18.370]  How did that guy not fucking die?
[25:18.470 --> 25:20.310]  Dude, their armor is insane.
[25:22.370 --> 25:22.730]  Nice.
[25:23.790 --> 25:24.570]  We're on the move.
[25:24.690 --> 25:25.490]  We're good, we're good.
[25:25.670 --> 25:26.970]  Watch your health.
[25:27.070 --> 25:27.690]  All clear.
[25:27.690 --> 25:29.030]  Oh, we got more.
[25:29.130 --> 25:29.590]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:29.710 --> 25:30.230]  There he is.
[25:30.270 --> 25:30.470]  Got him.
[25:30.810 --> 25:31.190]  He's down.
[25:31.370 --> 25:32.670]  Gotta kill him.
[25:32.750 --> 25:33.130]  Got him.
[25:33.290 --> 25:33.490]  Let's go.
[25:33.630 --> 25:34.230]  Lighten up his crotch.
[25:34.770 --> 25:35.530]  Yeah, he's done.
[25:36.310 --> 25:37.270]  Lighten up his crotch.
[25:37.590 --> 25:38.710]  Get these guys as they come.
[25:39.570 --> 25:39.730]  Yeah.
[25:39.910 --> 25:40.230]  Cover.
[25:40.490 --> 25:41.150]  Okay, we're moving.
[25:41.450 --> 25:42.790]  Oh, look.
[25:42.850 --> 25:43.850]  Those two guys right there.
[25:43.870 --> 25:44.570]  On the ground.
[25:45.830 --> 25:46.790]  Oh, around this corner.
[25:46.950 --> 25:47.330]  Around this corner.
[25:47.630 --> 25:47.970]  They're ice.
[25:48.050 --> 25:48.630]  Nice, nice, nice.
[25:49.510 --> 25:50.050]  Nicely done.
[25:50.730 --> 25:52.030]  Wow, they keep coming out of the building.
[25:52.110 --> 25:52.590]  Oh, here they come.
[25:54.510 --> 25:54.930]  Got him.
[25:55.030 --> 25:55.630]  Down the ramp.
[25:56.830 --> 25:57.670]  We're moving up.
[25:57.990 --> 25:58.570]  Getting into cover.
[25:59.570 --> 26:00.690]  Why won't it take me into cover?
[26:02.390 --> 26:03.730]  Should be another guy right around here.
[26:03.790 --> 26:05.210]  Alright, I'm taking this up because the chopper's coming in.
[26:06.230 --> 26:06.650]  Got him.
[26:06.910 --> 26:07.290]  He's down.
[26:07.530 --> 26:08.310]  Okay, we got him.
[26:08.530 --> 26:08.750]  Let's go.
[26:08.930 --> 26:09.110]  Get it.
[26:09.610 --> 26:10.290]  Is that in the head?
[26:11.230 --> 26:11.950]  I don't know.
[26:12.490 --> 26:13.930]  Okay, go to one of the keypads.
[26:14.730 --> 26:15.050]  Okay.
[26:16.870 --> 26:17.510]  And then...
[26:17.510 --> 26:18.430]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[26:18.490 --> 26:18.690]  Sorry.
[26:19.010 --> 26:20.010]  I'm trying to walk up to it.
[26:20.710 --> 26:21.670]  Okay, get in position.
[26:21.950 --> 26:22.390]  There we go.
[26:22.410 --> 26:23.330]  Alright, I'll take you up.
[26:23.490 --> 26:23.790]  I'll take you up.
[26:23.790 --> 26:24.550]  Keep spinning left.
[26:24.730 --> 26:24.850]  Yeah.
[26:25.730 --> 26:26.510]  Hang on.
[26:26.650 --> 26:27.270]  Okay, nice.
[26:27.650 --> 26:28.030]  On three.
[26:28.770 --> 26:29.910]  Is that when we just hit A?
[26:30.090 --> 26:30.990]  Alright, here we go.
[26:31.450 --> 26:31.490]  Yeah.
[26:31.670 --> 26:33.830]  Okay, one, two, three.
[26:35.250 --> 26:36.210]  Oh, synchronized.
[26:36.790 --> 26:37.210]  Nice.
[26:37.430 --> 26:37.730]  Nice.
[26:38.270 --> 26:38.710]  Beautiful.
[26:39.650 --> 26:40.310]  We did it.
[26:41.130 --> 26:41.610]  Okay.
[26:41.850 --> 26:42.550]  For England, James.
[26:42.870 --> 26:46.590]  I like because it's green vision, your green face paint doesn't show up.
[26:46.930 --> 26:48.650]  Yeah, I'm just a regular man at this point.
[26:49.930 --> 26:51.690]  How are you still alive?
[26:51.990 --> 26:52.450]  Die!
[26:52.450 --> 26:53.710]  How are you people still alive?
[26:53.730 --> 26:54.370]  Okay, we got it.
[26:55.830 --> 26:57.770]  Apparently the heat deters you.
[26:57.950 --> 26:58.530]  I'm with you, Gavin.
[26:59.650 --> 26:59.990]  Nice.
[27:00.130 --> 27:00.910]  Another one coming down.
[27:01.250 --> 27:01.450]  Yep.
[27:02.270 --> 27:03.470]  Alright, boys, we're going to the elevator.
[27:03.890 --> 27:04.410]  We got the piece.
[27:05.210 --> 27:05.930]  Nice shooting.
[27:07.390 --> 27:08.830]  I don't think I've ever done this level.
[27:09.210 --> 27:09.610]  What?
[27:10.070 --> 27:11.370]  I don't know, you just got shot?
[27:12.050 --> 27:12.870]  I got shot?
[27:13.390 --> 27:14.930]  Yeah, it just looks like you got shot.
[27:15.250 --> 27:15.810]  Oh, shit.
[27:17.350 --> 27:18.730]  Where are these little dudes?
[27:18.970 --> 27:21.190]  They're in the middle, but they just refused to die.
[27:21.570 --> 27:21.970]  Die!
[27:21.970 --> 27:23.430]  Oh, there's another truck coming.
[27:24.690 --> 27:25.230]  Got him?
[27:25.450 --> 27:25.750]  Yep.
[27:26.430 --> 27:27.090]  Let's get it.
[27:29.630 --> 27:31.570]  Careful of your health, watch this guy around the corner.
[27:32.730 --> 27:33.210]  Where is he?
[27:34.270 --> 27:34.770]  Got him.
[27:35.310 --> 27:35.930]  Oh, nice.
[27:35.970 --> 27:36.430]  Got him, we're good.
[27:37.190 --> 27:37.810]  I didn't even see it.
[27:37.850 --> 27:38.270]  Tactical roll.
[27:38.890 --> 27:39.450]  Tactical roll.
[27:41.190 --> 27:41.990]  Okay, we're good.
[27:42.750 --> 27:43.430]  Okay, we're in mood.
[27:44.670 --> 27:45.350]  Oh, shit.
[27:45.630 --> 27:47.250]  Are they under the overhang?
[27:48.370 --> 27:48.750]  Okay.
[27:48.950 --> 27:49.470]  I don't know.
[27:50.370 --> 27:51.590]  Do we just jump off this?
[27:51.590 --> 27:52.590]  I think so.
[27:54.110 --> 27:55.990]  Let's just take the...
[27:55.990 --> 27:56.690]  Take this.
[27:57.350 --> 27:58.530]  Oh, wow, you went right in.
[28:00.330 --> 28:03.450]  I'll be honest, I wasn't entirely convinced that was water, but I'm glad it was.
[28:04.130 --> 28:05.110]  How do I go down?
[28:08.510 --> 28:09.870]  Dude, I can't see shit.
[28:10.490 --> 28:11.930]  You can't see the yellow circle?
[28:15.410 --> 28:16.630]  Are you underwater?
[28:17.110 --> 28:18.450]  Yeah, I'm in the tunnel.
[28:18.730 --> 28:19.590]  How do you swim down?
[28:21.410 --> 28:22.090]  Right bumper?
[28:22.510 --> 28:22.870]  There we go.
[28:23.050 --> 28:24.230]  Thank you.
[28:24.450 --> 28:25.150]  Jesus Christ.
[28:25.270 --> 28:26.270]  Back over these guys here.
[28:26.450 --> 28:27.650]  Back to the middle area, I guess.
[28:29.710 --> 28:31.970]  Will you guys please die here?
[28:31.990 --> 28:33.410]  How do I use the rebreather?
[28:33.890 --> 28:34.490]  How am I doing this?
[28:34.550 --> 28:39.210]  You have to press left on the D-pad to equip it, and then you just go.
[28:41.710 --> 28:43.090]  There's one guy in the...
[28:43.090 --> 28:43.650]  Yep, got him.
[28:43.730 --> 28:44.510]  I'm swimming through this tunnel.
[28:44.510 --> 28:45.470]  Oh, there, I see them now.
[28:45.530 --> 28:46.070]  I see them now.
[28:46.170 --> 28:46.550]  There you go.
[28:47.030 --> 28:49.030]  I almost drowned before I put that on.
[28:49.470 --> 28:49.950]  Really?
[28:50.590 --> 28:50.890]  Yeah.
[28:54.150 --> 28:55.890]  How are you guys doing over there?
[28:56.450 --> 28:57.150]  This is nuts.
[28:57.230 --> 28:58.230]  They just keep spawning.
[28:58.690 --> 28:59.990]  They just keep spawning.
[29:00.590 --> 29:01.390]  We're fine.
[29:01.510 --> 29:02.230]  We're doing fine.
[29:02.390 --> 29:03.290]  It's a lot.
[29:03.670 --> 29:04.410]  You're doing great.
[29:04.670 --> 29:05.090]  You're doing great.
[29:05.210 --> 29:06.470]  We're almost out, I think.
[29:07.030 --> 29:11.230]  Yeah, I think every other time I've done the flying bit.
[29:12.130 --> 29:12.610]  Oh, wow.
[29:14.710 --> 29:15.790]  Now you've seen it all.
[29:16.550 --> 29:19.010]  Well, that explains why I didn't remember what was happening in this part.
[29:19.290 --> 29:19.690]  Sure.
[29:24.030 --> 29:24.670]  Get him.
[29:24.970 --> 29:25.890]  Still have rebreathers.
[29:26.650 --> 29:28.170]  I'm just still going through this tunnel.
[29:28.310 --> 29:30.050]  Did you just go through a really long tunnel, Gavin?
[29:30.250 --> 29:30.930]  That's all we're doing?
[29:31.210 --> 29:32.010]  He's in the courtyard.
[29:32.450 --> 29:32.570]  Nice.
[29:33.710 --> 29:35.610]  Is a rebreather a real thing?
[29:36.670 --> 29:37.750]  Don't think so.
[29:37.890 --> 29:39.830]  It seems like a video game thing, you know what I mean?
[29:39.850 --> 29:42.010]  Seems like a Star Wars thing.
[29:42.530 --> 29:43.270]  Yeah, big time.
[29:48.110 --> 29:49.530]  Oh, we're doing great.
[29:50.450 --> 29:52.170]  Oh, did you make it out?
[29:52.790 --> 29:53.070]  Yeah.
[29:53.610 --> 29:55.150]  So I guess now we fire the flare?
[29:56.450 --> 29:56.850]  Yeah.
[29:57.510 --> 29:59.630]  Give me a second, I gotta almost be there.
[29:59.870 --> 30:01.110]  This has been fucking forever.
[30:02.330 --> 30:03.330]  Alright, where's the flare at?
[30:04.930 --> 30:05.550]  Flare gun!
[30:06.270 --> 30:08.590]  Looking for the guard team signal flare.
[30:08.650 --> 30:09.330]  Eyes up!
[30:11.110 --> 30:11.770]  Flare's out.
[30:13.570 --> 30:15.150]  Am I supposed to go somewhere for this?
[30:15.450 --> 30:15.890]  I'm on my way up.
[30:15.890 --> 30:16.350]  After you, Gavin.
[30:17.230 --> 30:18.070]  Did that not count?
[30:18.470 --> 30:19.590]  Maybe we have to do it together.
[30:19.730 --> 30:20.470]  Maybe, maybe.
[30:20.650 --> 30:21.390]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[30:21.470 --> 30:21.870]  I'm almost there.
[30:22.790 --> 30:23.150]  And...
[30:23.150 --> 30:23.950]  Yeah, we don't see nothing.
[30:24.610 --> 30:24.850]  Air!
[30:25.330 --> 30:25.570]  Okay.
[30:26.610 --> 30:26.910]  Alright.
[30:27.030 --> 30:27.270]  We're coming.
[30:28.810 --> 30:30.790]  Oh, there they are.
[30:30.990 --> 30:31.470]  There it is.
[30:31.590 --> 30:31.990]  There they are.
[30:32.090 --> 30:32.410]  I see it.
[30:33.250 --> 30:37.870]  We should back up far away from where they can land because we're gonna get landed on.
[30:38.410 --> 30:39.510]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[30:40.670 --> 30:41.490]  Oh shit, God!
[30:41.610 --> 30:42.590]  We came back and landed on you, Gavin!
[30:42.650 --> 30:43.330]  Oh my God!
[30:46.110 --> 30:47.290]  Okay, we're here.
[30:47.310 --> 30:48.130]  I'm hiding in the bushes.
[30:48.130 --> 30:48.990]  I'm fucking in the bushes.
[30:49.970 --> 30:50.850]  Guys, over here!
[30:51.810 --> 30:52.490]  Oh my God.
[30:52.490 --> 30:52.870]  Jesus!
[30:53.010 --> 30:53.770]  We're bringing it in!
[30:53.910 --> 30:55.050]  Gavin, I don't want to do it again.
[30:55.090 --> 30:55.390]  Please.
[30:58.570 --> 31:00.190]  What are you doing?
[31:00.670 --> 31:01.430]  Jesus Christ!
[31:02.930 --> 31:03.310]  Jesus!
[31:04.010 --> 31:05.230]  What are you doing?
[31:05.550 --> 31:05.830]  Buddy!
[31:06.050 --> 31:06.810]  Okay, alright, alright.
[31:06.890 --> 31:07.470]  Shut up, shut up.
[31:07.490 --> 31:08.170]  Hold on, hold on.
[31:08.470 --> 31:09.330]  You're gonna murder me!
[31:11.130 --> 31:12.210]  You're gonna cut my head off.
[31:12.890 --> 31:13.290]  Oh!
[31:14.670 --> 31:15.590]  What the fuck?
[31:15.590 --> 31:17.210]  I don't like that we're still in the water.
[31:18.670 --> 31:20.290]  Okay, I'm taking damage in the water.
[31:20.810 --> 31:21.270]  Gavin, are you in?
[31:21.490 --> 31:21.990]  I'm in.
[31:22.650 --> 31:23.330]  Okay, let's do it.
[31:23.430 --> 31:24.610]  Oh my God.
[31:25.170 --> 31:27.030]  No, good job, Nick.
[31:27.290 --> 31:28.170]  I don't know what happened.
[31:28.470 --> 31:29.250]  That's never happened.
[31:31.450 --> 31:33.810]  The one time I've done this, this has never happened.
[31:33.930 --> 31:34.610]  Oh, great, okay.
[31:34.710 --> 31:35.450]  On your right side, Gavin.
[31:36.270 --> 31:36.470]  Shooting.
[31:37.190 --> 31:37.630]  You got it.
[31:38.410 --> 31:40.270]  Oh boy, that guy's shooting a ton.
[31:42.250 --> 31:44.130]  Is this what you guys have been doing the whole time?
[31:44.850 --> 31:45.490]  Yeah, oh shit.
[31:45.650 --> 31:47.270]  Oh my God, that's crazy.
[31:48.830 --> 31:50.010]  Might be close to the mountain.
[31:51.010 --> 31:51.550]  Yeah, we're alright.
[31:51.930 --> 31:52.570]  We're going up and over.
[31:53.190 --> 31:53.450]  Nice.
[31:54.910 --> 31:56.670]  Okay, got more helicopters coming in on the right.
[31:59.810 --> 32:00.130]  Alright.
[32:00.570 --> 32:01.250]  Below, back in.
[32:01.350 --> 32:02.670]  Gavin, your side, Gavin, your side.
[32:05.690 --> 32:06.490]  I'll circle you.
[32:09.510 --> 32:09.870]  Oh!
[32:10.230 --> 32:10.590]  Whoa!
[32:13.950 --> 32:15.390]  You're too far down.
[32:15.710 --> 32:15.970]  Down below us.
[32:15.970 --> 32:16.530]  He's down below us.
[32:16.970 --> 32:17.790]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:17.790 --> 32:18.530]  I'll circle you back.
[32:19.530 --> 32:20.410]  He's right behind you.
[32:20.410 --> 32:21.270]  Gavin, your side, you got it.
[32:21.670 --> 32:21.990]  I've got him.
[32:22.790 --> 32:23.770]  Oh shit, they're everywhere.
[32:23.770 --> 32:24.290]  I'm dragging this up a little bit.
[32:24.310 --> 32:25.410]  We don't have an angle on any of them.
[32:25.410 --> 32:26.590]  We've got another one directly above us.
[32:26.590 --> 32:27.130]  Mother of...
[32:27.130 --> 32:28.010]  Oh Christ!
[32:28.290 --> 32:29.310]  Lock on, lock on.
[32:30.590 --> 32:30.890]  Woo!
[32:31.070 --> 32:32.430]  Directly behind, directly behind.
[32:32.810 --> 32:34.050]  I just don't have an angle on any of them.
[32:34.050 --> 32:34.590]  Oh, they're in front.
[32:34.710 --> 32:35.070]  Oh boy.
[32:35.090 --> 32:36.070]  Alright, try it now, try it now.
[32:37.470 --> 32:38.030]  Down a bit.
[32:38.210 --> 32:39.270]  Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[32:41.050 --> 32:41.370]  Ah!
[32:41.370 --> 32:42.550]  Oh no!
[32:44.070 --> 32:46.650]  I think we need to be more evasive in the air.
[32:47.370 --> 32:47.710]  Yeah.
[32:48.270 --> 32:51.470]  Alright, I was trying to give us more shots, but yeah, I'll just be more evasive.
[32:51.470 --> 32:52.790]  Yeah, don't give us more shots.
[32:52.850 --> 32:53.570]  We have three guns.
[32:53.930 --> 32:55.790]  I think that should be on us.
[32:55.790 --> 32:57.090]  And if you could prioritize me.
[32:57.690 --> 32:58.010]  Yeah.
[32:58.270 --> 32:59.090]  I'm fine with that.
[32:59.090 --> 32:59.490]  I have a missile.
[32:59.690 --> 33:01.530]  We're low guns on the side, so...
[33:01.530 --> 33:02.550]  Yeah, I'm a little dweeb gun.
[33:03.130 --> 33:03.330]  Yeah.
[33:03.710 --> 33:04.710]  How far back do you think he puts them?
[33:06.030 --> 33:06.650]  All the way.
[33:06.950 --> 33:07.670]  Yeah, I agree.
[33:08.730 --> 33:09.870]  I fucking hate helicopters.
[33:12.990 --> 33:14.730]  Oh wow, it puts us at the beach?
[33:15.370 --> 33:17.210]  That's so much more dangerous than I thought.
[33:17.210 --> 33:20.010]  This is the nicest game in the world.
[33:20.910 --> 33:21.290]  Gabby!
[33:24.250 --> 33:25.910]  Gabby wants to help this time as well.
[33:26.310 --> 33:26.830]  It's even better.
[33:28.010 --> 33:28.870]  Oh god, take off!
[33:30.070 --> 33:34.990]  Nick, what you have to do is you have to hold the gas, that way the rotor goes, and then you can go up in the air.
[33:35.290 --> 33:37.550]  What do you think the...
[33:37.550 --> 33:38.390]  I'm not sure.
[33:38.530 --> 33:39.910]  Looking at it, I don't know.
[33:41.290 --> 33:43.390]  It's not like I was boosting it, my man!
[33:44.830 --> 33:45.150]  Nice!
[33:45.550 --> 33:46.930]  Wow, what a shot!
[33:49.910 --> 33:51.590]  Here we go, here they come, right side.
[33:53.190 --> 33:55.910]  You focus on those guys, I'm taking us to this Ferg.
[33:57.330 --> 33:57.630]  What?
[33:58.530 --> 33:59.430]  I don't have an angle.
[33:59.930 --> 34:00.670]  I'll swing you around.
[34:02.090 --> 34:02.710]  Thank you.
[34:03.070 --> 34:03.450]  You're welcome.
[34:04.390 --> 34:05.130]  Nice shot!
[34:07.270 --> 34:07.990]  Holy balls!
[34:09.010 --> 34:09.790]  Alright, which one's closer?
[34:12.430 --> 34:17.650]  The one ahead and to the right looks... it's coming up, but I'm just trying to like lead it.
[34:17.750 --> 34:18.250]  There he is, Andrew.
[34:19.750 --> 34:21.810]  Is that a smoke monster? What am I looking at?
[34:22.270 --> 34:23.210]  Yeah, it's a smoke monster.
[34:23.570 --> 34:23.750]  Alright.
[34:24.430 --> 34:25.050]  Head's down.
[34:25.710 --> 34:25.990]  Nice.
[34:26.070 --> 34:26.990]  That's just the one on the right?
[34:27.250 --> 34:27.510]  Yep.
[34:28.290 --> 34:28.970]  Bring us about.
[34:30.970 --> 34:32.210]  Are we above it or below it?
[34:32.750 --> 34:34.390]  He's above us, he's above us.
[34:35.130 --> 34:35.830]  We're going up.
[34:35.970 --> 34:36.770]  Now he's behind.
[34:37.890 --> 34:38.570]  Turn to the right.
[34:39.790 --> 34:40.530]  Turn to the right.
[34:40.690 --> 34:41.950]  Come on, come on.
[34:43.170 --> 34:43.950]  Sorry, sorry.
[34:44.190 --> 34:45.190]  Alright, let's go.
[34:47.450 --> 34:47.890]  Cool.
[34:48.510 --> 34:49.270]  Meeting point.
[34:49.510 --> 34:49.830]  Good work.
[34:51.330 --> 34:51.770]  Easy.
[34:52.270 --> 34:53.790]  Oh, thank God, it sent us back there.
[34:54.370 --> 34:55.930]  Look at the beautiful... look at the sun.
[34:56.530 --> 34:59.030]  I'm going over it, I'm not even thinking about it.
[35:00.430 --> 35:03.590]  Yeah, he's not even thinking about it, that's why he said something.
[35:03.590 --> 35:06.530]  What about one of the stationary ones?
[35:07.990 --> 35:08.110]  High.
[35:09.170 --> 35:10.150]  I am high.
[35:11.210 --> 35:11.650]  Above.
[35:11.950 --> 35:12.510]  Just reminding.
[35:13.070 --> 35:14.350]  I'm trying to counter the Gavin.
[35:14.950 --> 35:16.030]  Okay, well...
[35:17.650 --> 35:21.990]  I died once, so I'm going Gavin death right now.
[35:24.050 --> 35:26.050]  Has everyone died once, except Andrew?
[35:26.750 --> 35:27.250]  Except Andrew.
[35:27.990 --> 35:29.930]  Well, he died with us, so...
[35:29.930 --> 35:30.750]  That's true.
[35:31.510 --> 35:32.470]  Not at fault, though.
[35:32.830 --> 35:33.170]  No.
[35:33.170 --> 35:35.070]  Remember when Gavin didn't open his parachute?
[35:35.690 --> 35:36.570]  Yeah, that was my bad.
[35:38.670 --> 35:40.370]  That's where I lost the 5%.
[35:40.370 --> 35:43.110]  Yeah, that's really... nice rough trade.
[35:43.510 --> 35:43.950]  Do we jump?
[35:44.850 --> 35:45.290]  No.
[35:45.390 --> 35:47.290]  No, not yet. I'll let you know when.
[35:49.030 --> 35:50.010]  Is it when we land?
[35:51.010 --> 35:51.450]  Yes.
[35:52.570 --> 35:55.430]  It's when Nick slams us into the ground when he lands.
[35:55.990 --> 35:57.710]  Okay, let's let everybody calm down.
[35:59.810 --> 36:01.810]  I'm a little nervous now that you've said that.
[36:03.170 --> 36:04.530]  We'll just land gentle style.
[36:05.170 --> 36:06.570]  There's a circle in everything.
[36:07.270 --> 36:07.970]  Got it.
[36:08.870 --> 36:09.850]  It's all good.
[36:11.110 --> 36:11.930]  And jump!
[36:16.170 --> 36:17.430]  Press Y to land gently.
[36:17.930 --> 36:19.110]  Shut your mouth. Shut up.
[36:22.010 --> 36:24.170]  There we go. Is this really the end?
[36:24.490 --> 36:24.930]  We did it!
[36:25.590 --> 36:26.490]  That's it, baby!
[36:26.910 --> 36:27.550]  Look at us.
[36:30.450 --> 36:32.490]  Why did we do that heist in suits?
[36:32.490 --> 36:33.450]  That's awesome.
[36:34.370 --> 36:35.390]  Yeah, why were we in suits?
[36:37.250 --> 36:38.970]  What's the most heist? Swimming!
[36:47.210 --> 36:48.590]  Is this really it?
[36:50.750 --> 36:52.490]  Yeah, I think we did it.
[37:00.770 --> 37:03.930]  He's being kind of threatening for someone who's outnumbered in the desert.
[37:04.550 --> 37:04.770]  Yeah.
[37:06.030 --> 37:10.990]  Oh, please tell me we don't... yeah. Thank God.
[37:11.870 --> 37:12.330]  Yeah!
[37:14.650 --> 37:15.930]  We were cool as hell.
[37:16.570 --> 37:17.790]  There was a thumbnail in there somewhere.
[37:18.810 --> 37:19.210]  Haha!
[37:22.090 --> 37:22.490]  Silver!
[37:22.690 --> 37:23.730]  Nick with the platinum!
[37:23.890 --> 37:24.290]  Yeah!
[37:26.550 --> 37:29.330]  Nicest game in the world to give Nick the platinum. That was great.
[37:29.510 --> 37:32.170]  Man, I'm a great pilot. Get out of here.
[37:35.570 --> 37:36.770]  Fleet Challenge Void.
[37:36.810 --> 37:37.390]  Didn't do that.
[37:37.870 --> 37:40.830]  But hey, some good money.
[37:41.190 --> 37:42.750]  Some good money.
[37:42.790 --> 37:45.330]  I made $39,000 and that seemed like a lot of work for that.
[37:46.370 --> 37:47.190]  That's all you made?
[37:48.410 --> 37:48.830]  Yeah.
[37:50.750 --> 37:52.110]  How much did you make, Gavin?
[37:53.050 --> 37:53.770]  Probably $20,000.
[37:54.110 --> 37:55.950]  I thought it was like $250,000, wasn't it?
[37:56.670 --> 37:58.250]  I made $395,000.
[37:58.510 --> 38:00.730]  Oh, I was off on a comma.
[38:02.150 --> 38:04.230]  Guys, I think that was pretty worth it.
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.160]  I like the idea of you only having $39,000 and Gavin just being loaded with cash.
[38:15.200 --> 38:17.460]  This is the gang right here. Guys, this is the crew.
[38:17.960 --> 38:18.860]  Let's make it rain.
[38:21.480 --> 38:23.500]  My wife won't let me do that.
[38:25.260 --> 38:26.980]  My wife said I'm not allowed to make it rain.
[38:28.640 --> 38:30.520]  Is making it rain tossing $3?
[38:31.460 --> 38:31.680]  Yeah.
[38:32.940 --> 38:33.960]  In this economy?
[38:34.940 --> 38:35.500]  Inflation?
[38:35.780 --> 38:37.580]  I'm going to stand here until I'm broke.
[38:39.920 --> 38:42.680]  Hey, Gavin, is the view cool?
[38:44.020 --> 38:45.560]  Can you see me pretty good?
[38:46.520 --> 38:47.740]  Yeah, we're both...
[38:47.740 --> 38:49.740]  I mean, you're doing...
[38:50.460 --> 38:51.640]  Are you doing as much as me?
[38:53.820 --> 38:55.400]  But do I look like a rat man?
[38:56.220 --> 38:57.300]  No, you got no mask on.
[38:57.680 --> 38:57.920]  No!
[38:59.580 --> 39:01.940]  Oh, there it is. It came on when you leant away.
[39:02.820 --> 39:03.180]  Why?
[39:03.680 --> 39:04.340]  Oh, she's coming over.
[39:13.500 --> 39:14.600]  This is great.
[39:14.900 --> 39:16.040]  I think I've spent like $500.
[39:19.480 --> 39:20.580]  She likes me, though.
[39:20.840 --> 39:22.420]  Nick, can you see this? Does this look cool?
[39:23.900 --> 39:24.260]  No.
[39:24.440 --> 39:25.860]  You're about to give her a whole short card.
[39:27.960 --> 39:28.320]  No.
[39:30.260 --> 39:31.360]  Does this look cool?
[39:31.600 --> 39:31.960]  No.
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.460]  It looks like you were having a good time with Gavin there for a minute while he was tossing money.
[39:39.120 --> 39:39.500]  Oh, hello.
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.140]  I can't do that. I'm recording this video.
[39:41.560 --> 39:43.660]  I can't do that right now. I'm recording this video.
[39:43.820 --> 39:44.380]  Oh, bloody hell.
[39:44.900 --> 39:46.200]  My wife's going to be so mad at me.
[39:47.420 --> 39:50.560]  Gavin, Gavin, you have to stop throwing money away.
[39:51.280 --> 39:54.320]  I know, I can't stop. She just really likes me and I can't stop.
[39:54.660 --> 39:57.260]  She really, guys, she really...
[39:57.260 --> 40:01.260]  Guys, guys, this has happened to me before. She really likes me.
[40:06.460 --> 40:07.500]  Fellas, fellas.
[40:10.640 --> 40:12.680]  That is really graphic.
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.400]  Did someone have to mocap this?
[40:15.680 --> 40:16.410]  Oh my god.
[40:19.560 --> 40:20.160]  Bloody hell.
[40:22.780 --> 40:26.280]  Okay, guys, we did it. The heist crew, how are you guys feeling about that heist? Feel good?
[40:26.800 --> 40:28.760]  Fantastic. I'm ready to start the next one.
[40:28.920 --> 40:29.980]  Yeah, let's do it.
[40:30.100 --> 40:31.100]  I'm going to need to go to an ATM.
[40:32.280 --> 40:34.680]  Oh, I think I maxed out. I've got no money left.
[40:35.240 --> 40:36.420]  Yeah, I think you're done. I think you're happy.
[40:36.420 --> 40:40.480]  And that is why Gavin got the lowest share of that heist.
[40:41.600 --> 40:41.960]  Fuck.
[40:42.420 --> 40:44.580]  Thank you so much for watching.
[40:44.620 --> 40:46.340]  Gavin, if you're out of money, I'll dance for you, dude.
[40:47.540 --> 40:49.200]  I'm good. I'm fulfilled.
[40:49.580 --> 40:49.920]  Where are you going?
[40:49.980 --> 40:50.540]  Meet me outside.
[40:50.560 --> 40:51.380]  Where are you going?
[40:51.940 --> 40:52.920]  Meet me outside, Ratman.
[40:53.340 --> 40:54.200]  Come back. Where are you going?
[40:54.540 --> 40:54.940]  Come back.
[40:55.240 --> 40:56.680]  Andrew, now do the outro.

[41:04.840 --> 41:05.680]  You guys look to me funny.
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.400]  Hey, I'm a paying customer.
[41:07.420 --> 41:07.640]  You look to me funny?
[41:08.860 --> 41:09.800]  There's no dogs for kids.
[41:11.640 --> 41:13.740]  Well, get ready for the next one, Gavin.
[41:14.100 --> 41:14.700]  Nick, what happened?
[41:15.000 --> 41:15.460]  More guys.
[41:15.760 --> 41:15.960]  I'm dead.
[41:16.880 --> 41:18.280]  They killed Nick.
[41:18.540 --> 41:19.780]  Yeah, Nick was shooting at me.
[41:19.780 --> 41:21.620]  I had to walk in a circle and then kill him.
[41:22.280 --> 41:23.900]  I'm glad I just went back to the apartment.
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.580]  Yeah, I wish I would have done that, too.
[41:25.940 --> 41:27.660]  Alright, guys, we'll see you next time.
[41:27.800 --> 41:28.160]  Bye.
[41:28.780 --> 41:29.360]  Bye, now.
