[00:00.000 --> 00:01.280]  When did the video start?
[00:01.720 --> 00:02.420]  Right now!
[00:04.380 --> 00:08.460]  Welcome to Worms. It's a 5 player game of Worms. Can you believe it?
[00:08.640 --> 00:10.200]  It always has been, apparently.
[00:10.500 --> 00:11.600]  I don't...
[00:12.280 --> 00:15.440]  I get what you're saying. I don't even know, dude.
[00:16.160 --> 00:17.620]  That's not quite what I was talking about there.
[00:18.100 --> 00:20.080]  The 5 player aspect. Look at all our names in there.
[00:20.480 --> 00:21.940]  Why am I bleeped?
[00:22.040 --> 00:23.400]  Oh, Nick got bleeped out.
[00:24.120 --> 00:29.300]  I don't know where this video started, but just understand, if it's right now, it's really difficult to
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.620]  process what's happening.
[00:31.240 --> 00:32.400]  I'm gonna start crafting.
[00:34.580 --> 00:34.840]  Uh-oh.
[00:35.480 --> 00:36.080]  Uh-oh.
[00:38.300 --> 00:39.600]  Get the hell out of here.
[00:39.820 --> 00:40.460]  Who's fleeing?
[00:41.600 --> 00:43.560]  Oh, he's going for Gumpy.
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.260]  You've shot yourself a little bit.
[00:46.400 --> 00:47.020]  What the hell?
[00:47.720 --> 00:49.180]  I'm trying to get out of here. Oh no!
[00:49.300 --> 00:49.840]  Oh no!
[00:52.440 --> 00:52.880]  Okay.
[00:53.660 --> 00:55.640]  I did not know that that would happen.
[00:56.140 --> 00:59.160]  I'm trying to make this a 4 player game.
[01:00.200 --> 01:01.800]  Did you even rename your worms?
[01:01.880 --> 01:02.900]  Didn't you already have Dogfather?
[01:03.420 --> 01:05.360]  Yeah, I did. And no, I didn't.
[01:05.380 --> 01:05.620]  Oh.
[01:07.380 --> 01:09.420]  He didn't know he was gonna be playing today.
[01:09.520 --> 01:10.920]  Nope. Thought it was gonna...
[01:10.920 --> 01:13.580]  I was pitching you three and Nick
[01:13.580 --> 01:15.360]  because I felt like that would be a fun dynamic
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.500]  and then I would watch and that would be really cool
[01:17.500 --> 01:20.740]  and then you went, we could do all of us together.
[01:20.960 --> 01:23.160]  A thing we've never been able to do before.
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.180]  I don't know, it sounds like you had at least 18 minutes of us arguing to name some worms.
[01:27.180 --> 01:29.520]  I was also in the argument!
[01:30.320 --> 01:31.620]  I was also in the argument
[01:31.620 --> 01:32.780]  but I did name my worms.
[01:33.020 --> 01:34.660]  I was too and I also named mine.
[01:34.740 --> 01:36.040]  Oh, he's gone in the robot head.
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.280]  I took two of my bottom names and put them into my top names.
[01:39.620 --> 01:40.220]  Oh, okay.
[01:41.700 --> 01:43.900]  This is 40 playing right now?
[01:45.760 --> 01:47.820]  This is team hot dog count playing.
[01:48.280 --> 01:49.580]  And this is 40?
[01:50.300 --> 01:53.180]  This is 40, this is reflective of somebody's hot dog count.
[01:53.260 --> 01:53.520]  Oh, dang.
[01:54.060 --> 01:54.460]  Dumpy.
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.100]  Salty munt.
[01:57.320 --> 01:58.280]  Yeah, no, you can shoot them.
[01:58.480 --> 01:59.040]  Yeah, shoot Dumpy.
[01:59.280 --> 02:02.640]  Oh, he's on a turret. I didn't even see the turret.
[02:02.660 --> 02:03.320]  Not anymore.
[02:04.540 --> 02:05.040]  Why?
[02:05.980 --> 02:06.980]  Why me?
[02:07.700 --> 02:09.720]  Oh my god!
[02:11.100 --> 02:11.600]  Burn!
[02:12.540 --> 02:13.260]  Six player game!
[02:14.580 --> 02:16.060]  Six player game?
[02:16.580 --> 02:17.540]  God, no.
[02:19.520 --> 02:20.960]  Six player game?
[02:21.420 --> 02:22.920]  Hey Gavin, what's a salty munt?
[02:24.060 --> 02:24.960]  I'll tell you later.
[02:25.140 --> 02:25.920]  Wait, who's Gavin?
[02:27.180 --> 02:27.860]  That's me.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.620]  Gavin is clearly...
[02:30.620 --> 02:31.660]  What's going on?
[02:32.160 --> 02:34.960]  My team name is Gavin is clearly insane this morning.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.720]  This morning, I see that. That's pretty good.
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.300]  That's pretty good.
[02:39.800 --> 02:40.840]  It is, it's true.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.300]  Mutt tricks.
[02:44.800 --> 02:45.240]  See?
[02:45.620 --> 02:46.980]  Oh yeah, why didn't you change?
[02:47.060 --> 02:47.800]  It's a good...
[02:47.800 --> 02:49.640]  Oh my god.
[02:49.640 --> 02:50.880]  Go, go, climb!
[02:52.000 --> 02:53.180]  Oh my god.
[02:53.300 --> 02:55.740]  I gotta shake the worm rust off.
[02:56.020 --> 02:56.600]  Yeah, me too.
[02:57.020 --> 02:58.480]  Nick's getting railed.
[02:58.520 --> 02:59.780]  What's going on here?
[03:01.860 --> 03:02.860]  Hey, it's Nutskullman.
[03:02.860 --> 03:04.940]  That's what we've been saying for the past 30 minutes, Nick.
[03:06.680 --> 03:08.540]  I know, that's why I said it again.
[03:09.480 --> 03:10.500]  Wait, how do you jump?
[03:11.360 --> 03:12.020]  A, I believe.
[03:12.760 --> 03:15.040]  You've been playing this for 20 years.
[03:16.060 --> 03:16.720]  Hey, this is...
[03:16.720 --> 03:18.140]  This guy doesn't know how to jump,
[03:18.140 --> 03:19.900]  but he knows about six players.
[03:20.420 --> 03:21.640]  Yeah, six player support.
[03:23.040 --> 03:23.720]  Hey, Gavin.
[03:24.220 --> 03:24.480]  Yeah.
[03:25.840 --> 03:26.840]  What the hell?
[03:27.860 --> 03:28.400]  Oh no!
[03:30.220 --> 03:32.820]  God, you killed Kumpy.
[03:33.240 --> 03:33.640]  You suck.
[03:35.440 --> 03:36.200]  Nutskullman.
[03:36.540 --> 03:37.060]  Man.
[03:40.060 --> 03:42.700]  What censored name is this, Nick?
[03:43.580 --> 03:45.720]  So, all of them are umpies.
[03:45.720 --> 03:48.260]  This one was Kumpy, but apparently that's not good.
[03:48.860 --> 03:49.380]  What?
[03:50.300 --> 03:50.820]  Kumpy.
[03:51.840 --> 03:52.240]  Whoa!
[03:54.020 --> 03:55.420]  Oh, come on!
[03:55.980 --> 03:56.880]  You suck.
[03:57.780 --> 04:00.300]  Dude, six player game is getting the heat this game.
[04:00.780 --> 04:02.660]  Yeah, outline around the enemy there.
[04:06.580 --> 04:07.100]  Okay.
[04:08.120 --> 04:10.220]  Rumpy, you can build stuff.
[04:10.860 --> 04:11.760]  Yeah, I'm doing that.
[04:12.240 --> 04:13.500]  Oh, yeah, I can.
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.720]  Oh, God!
[04:18.280 --> 04:18.980]  Have you killed me?
[04:20.060 --> 04:20.780]  Locked in.
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.480]  Did someone fall in the water? What was that noise?
[04:24.020 --> 04:24.420]  My tricks.
[04:25.740 --> 04:26.940]  Oh my God!
[04:27.180 --> 04:28.760]  Yeah, baby.
[04:29.800 --> 04:31.140]  Am I dead? I died.
[04:31.600 --> 04:32.680]  That's how this game works.
[04:33.360 --> 04:33.440]  Yeah.
[04:36.620 --> 04:39.120]  So, is this each of our...
[04:39.120 --> 04:39.800]  Like, there's three.
[04:39.880 --> 04:40.400]  That's me, right?
[04:43.060 --> 04:43.540]  Uh...
[04:43.540 --> 04:45.180]  Yep, that's you. You're three.
[04:45.460 --> 04:46.360]  Oh my God!
[04:46.940 --> 04:48.300]  Straight to the earth.
[04:49.140 --> 04:50.500]  I don't want to do this.
[04:51.020 --> 04:52.760]  Well, away from six player game, probably.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.620]  I don't think so.
[04:55.340 --> 04:57.120]  I think that's the only thing I feel good about.
[04:57.500 --> 04:59.320]  Yeah, chop him down. Cut him up.
[05:00.780 --> 05:01.180]  Burrow.
[05:01.300 --> 05:02.340]  I don't want to get this angle.
[05:03.540 --> 05:04.700]  Oh my God.
[05:06.000 --> 05:06.280]  Shit!
[05:06.760 --> 05:06.960]  No!
[05:09.340 --> 05:10.440]  Straight to the earth!
[05:10.440 --> 05:11.440]  Oh no!
[05:12.280 --> 05:13.680]  They grinded each other up.
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.220]  Leave my tricks alone.
[05:17.140 --> 05:18.360]  Sorry, my tricks.
[05:19.300 --> 05:21.100]  I wanted a six player game.
[05:22.320 --> 05:23.280]  You suck.
[05:24.320 --> 05:24.800]  Christ.
[05:28.120 --> 05:30.120]  Why were we only playing four players?
[05:30.420 --> 05:31.620]  It makes no sense.
[05:32.220 --> 05:32.320]  None.
[05:33.480 --> 05:37.860]  Is that in the video or not? Because if not, we need to explain what happened in this video.
[05:37.900 --> 05:39.160]  Yeah, why don't you explain it, just to be safe.
[05:39.160 --> 05:41.600]  We've been playing this Worms game
[05:41.600 --> 05:43.840]  since before the company started.
[05:44.100 --> 05:44.840]  Over a year.
[05:45.140 --> 05:46.680]  Gavin's been playing it for 15 years.
[05:47.100 --> 05:48.880]  And we've never made a Worms video
[05:48.880 --> 05:50.840]  with more than four of us when there's five.
[05:51.480 --> 05:53.440]  Because we thought that you could only play
[05:53.440 --> 05:55.320]  up to four, but then today
[05:55.320 --> 05:56.920]  Gavin's like, well, we all play.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.340]  What is this six player game?
[05:58.920 --> 06:00.160]  Oh, you're going to fall!
[06:00.840 --> 06:02.360]  Let me ask you this.
[06:02.600 --> 06:04.840]  Why didn't you know it was that many players?
[06:06.020 --> 06:07.560]  Because I just...
[06:07.560 --> 06:09.640]  I haven't played this game
[06:10.340 --> 06:11.960]  nearly as much as you have.
[06:12.420 --> 06:14.200]  And I just assumed it was four
[06:14.200 --> 06:15.880]  because we've always only done four.
[06:16.280 --> 06:17.240]  Yep, you assumed.
[06:17.840 --> 06:18.500]  Gavin's here!
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.900]  Now that is a classic.
[06:22.060 --> 06:22.820]  How that turn played out.
[06:23.120 --> 06:24.680]  That's a classic Geoff turn.
[06:26.080 --> 06:28.160]  Alright, it's Kirk Gundervag.
[06:28.620 --> 06:29.180]  Let's see.
[06:30.480 --> 06:31.960]  Anyway, so that led to a large
[06:31.960 --> 06:32.880]  discussion.
[06:33.720 --> 06:34.760]  I put that in quotes.
[06:34.760 --> 06:37.080]  About whether or not the game
[06:37.080 --> 06:38.160]  was actually six players.
[06:38.460 --> 06:41.040]  Which it is.
[06:42.200 --> 06:42.760]  Unfortunately,
[06:43.100 --> 06:45.140]  one of us chose to gatekeep that
[06:45.140 --> 06:47.040]  information. One of us didn't want to let
[06:47.040 --> 06:48.020]  anyone else know.
[06:48.640 --> 06:50.480]  There's somebody that's going to watch this video
[06:50.480 --> 06:52.860]  that's going to say, or watch whatever that
[06:52.860 --> 06:55.120]  content is that got put out somewhere
[06:55.120 --> 06:55.960]  else in some form.
[06:56.520 --> 06:58.520]  This is more than four?
[06:59.220 --> 06:59.880]  What the fuck?
[07:00.340 --> 07:01.300]  People are learning.
[07:01.300 --> 07:03.220]  I know that in his mind cave
[07:03.220 --> 07:04.700]  is a greedy little...
[07:06.980 --> 07:08.720]  I'm going to run out of time.
[07:08.920 --> 07:09.400]  So close.
[07:10.920 --> 07:11.200]  No!
[07:12.040 --> 07:12.220]  No!
[07:13.020 --> 07:13.720]  He missed!
[07:15.620 --> 07:16.100]  No!
[07:18.480 --> 07:20.020]  I suck at that sheep!
[07:21.840 --> 07:23.020]  Hate this game!
[07:24.840 --> 07:25.820]  You could have just
[07:25.820 --> 07:26.820]  said, leave me out.
[07:26.900 --> 07:29.660]  Hey, when you hate this game, what's the max players you can hate it with?
[07:32.380 --> 07:33.420]  Oh man.
[07:33.640 --> 07:34.380]  So to summarize,
[07:34.780 --> 07:36.100]  I'm getting blamed because
[07:36.100 --> 07:38.160]  I knew it was five players and apparently never
[07:38.160 --> 07:40.180]  mentioned it. You're getting punished
[07:40.180 --> 07:42.300]  because you hoarded the information
[07:42.300 --> 07:43.820]  like Gollum with the ring.
[07:46.260 --> 07:48.020]  I wish I was invisible right now.
[07:48.460 --> 07:50.100]  Gavin, the way you just
[07:50.100 --> 07:52.040]  explained that is exactly the reason
[07:52.040 --> 07:54.120]  and then also, I don't know why you
[07:54.120 --> 07:55.780]  think that makes us sound crazy.
[07:55.980 --> 07:57.940]  Let me really condense this down
[07:57.940 --> 07:59.620]  into a very straight form.
[08:00.020 --> 08:02.740]  Gavin, if there's five of us, should all five of us be playing?
[08:03.280 --> 08:04.900]  Big time. That's why I suggested it.
[08:05.220 --> 08:05.960]  And you
[08:07.820 --> 08:08.180]  loved...
[08:12.800 --> 08:13.720]  It's done. It's done.
[08:13.880 --> 08:14.800]  It's all we need.
[08:16.300 --> 08:18.340]  Anyway, that's also why Eric's names
[08:18.340 --> 08:19.320]  are the same as the first time.
[08:19.600 --> 08:21.120]  Oh, what's this blue grenade about?
[08:21.500 --> 08:22.680]  I don't know what it does.
[08:22.840 --> 08:26.120]  It just said magnetic drone.
[08:26.940 --> 08:27.800]  Chug that shit.
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.060]  I've never seen this, I don't think.
[08:30.960 --> 08:32.480]  I don't know what it does.
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.820]  Do you have to deploy it?
[08:34.300 --> 08:35.000]  I don't know.
[08:35.880 --> 08:36.880]  There it goes.
[08:40.300 --> 08:42.360]  No, Gav, Salty Munt, it broke.
[08:42.900 --> 08:44.340]  You crashed a drone on my head?
[08:44.720 --> 08:45.980]  I did. Nothing happened.
[08:46.340 --> 08:47.980]  Maybe it picked something up. I don't know.
[08:48.400 --> 08:49.780]  I think it's a repellent.
[08:50.060 --> 08:52.100]  It repels stuff from Salty Munt now.
[08:52.680 --> 08:54.340]  Really? Thanks, Eric.
[08:54.340 --> 08:55.960]  That beats me.
[08:56.420 --> 08:58.460]  Hey, you're welcome, I guess.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.660]  You invented Munt repellent.
[09:04.340 --> 09:05.460]  Come on.
[09:06.100 --> 09:08.480]  There you go. Oh, he did it.
[09:09.520 --> 09:10.680]  Hit him with a baseball bat or something.
[09:10.800 --> 09:11.740]  Yeah, home run that shit.
[09:11.960 --> 09:13.180]  Throw a grenade on me.
[09:15.420 --> 09:17.920]  Oh, what the fuck?
[09:19.740 --> 09:21.820]  Where did it go?
[09:21.820 --> 09:23.000]  Where did it go?
[09:23.300 --> 09:23.920]  Side fetch!
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.260]  Side fetch run!
[09:30.960 --> 09:32.400]  Oh, side fetch!
[09:32.880 --> 09:35.420]  That thing pinged further up than you could have thrown it.
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.180]  That was amazing.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.560]  I want another one of those drones.
[09:38.660 --> 09:39.160]  That was cool.
[09:39.340 --> 09:40.440]  This magnet's great.
[09:40.860 --> 09:41.820]  Yeah, it's pretty neat.
[09:42.320 --> 09:44.160]  I thought gravity stopped working for a moment.
[09:46.800 --> 09:49.020]  Well, there goes my fucking turn.
[09:51.080 --> 09:53.060]  Much longer to wait between turns
[09:53.060 --> 09:53.940]  when there's five players.
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.840]  God damn it!
[10:00.500 --> 10:01.820]  Alright, salty munt.
[10:03.100 --> 10:05.040]  Salty god damn munt. Let's see.
[10:06.140 --> 10:09.360]  I kind of liked what Andrew had going there.
[10:09.380 --> 10:10.900]  You just kind of let her rip.
[10:11.320 --> 10:13.500]  I pointed right at the ground, just so you know.
[10:13.700 --> 10:14.040]  There it goes.
[10:15.780 --> 10:17.020]  So I don't know if you want to arc it.
[10:17.080 --> 10:18.640]  Like let God decide?
[10:19.280 --> 10:19.560]  Yeah.
[10:19.560 --> 10:21.620]  I'm gonna go full beans into the ground.
[10:24.000 --> 10:25.800]  Oh my God, please!
[10:26.040 --> 10:27.460]  Do it, do it, do it, do it.
[10:27.760 --> 10:29.040]  Here you go, here you go, here you go.
[10:29.380 --> 10:29.740]  Yeah!
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.440]  Whoa!
[10:33.920 --> 10:35.140]  It's just gone.
[10:38.460 --> 10:39.800]  It went so far!
[10:42.380 --> 10:44.020]  That was awesome!
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.400]  I'm good as shit.
[10:46.800 --> 10:47.440]  Hmm.
[10:48.220 --> 10:49.360]  Is that a turret?
[10:50.600 --> 10:52.120]  Where? No, definitely not.
[10:52.500 --> 10:52.800]  Okay.
[10:56.720 --> 10:59.600]  How do I...
[10:59.600 --> 10:59.960]  Yeah!
[11:01.360 --> 11:02.640]  You made it!
[11:03.520 --> 11:05.460]  What was that ever gonna be?
[11:05.980 --> 11:07.560]  Where was that going anyway?
[11:09.020 --> 11:11.220]  At least confirm there's a turret over there.
[11:11.400 --> 11:12.200]  You got a little action.
[11:13.160 --> 11:13.780]  Oh!
[11:13.780 --> 11:16.140]  That was terrible.
[11:16.240 --> 11:17.500]  What am I doing?
[11:19.620 --> 11:20.640]  Alright, let's see.
[11:21.220 --> 11:22.000]  The beagles.
[11:22.720 --> 11:25.080]  I don't think I can...
[11:25.080 --> 11:25.960]  Oh, you're getting into Lumpy?
[11:29.380 --> 11:29.720]  Oh!
[11:30.820 --> 11:31.440]  Lumpy!
[11:32.160 --> 11:33.240]  Right through the gap!
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.140]  What a hit!
[11:38.360 --> 11:38.660]  What?
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.480]  You shouldn't have been there.
[11:40.480 --> 11:42.700]  I didn't know you could kick people out!
[11:42.940 --> 11:43.460]  Yeah, me neither.
[11:43.660 --> 11:45.680]  We all learned something.
[11:48.600 --> 11:50.020]  Want me to be 18?
[11:50.360 --> 11:50.820]  Yeah!
[11:53.020 --> 11:54.280]  Give me the box!
[11:54.960 --> 11:55.900]  Who has the 18 count?
[11:58.520 --> 11:58.980]  Uh...
[11:58.980 --> 11:59.320]  Me?
[12:00.040 --> 12:00.960]  It might be me.
[12:01.580 --> 12:04.760]  No, I only have like 13 or 14.
[12:05.040 --> 12:05.800]  Then it's Nick.
[12:06.240 --> 12:07.020]  Yeah, it's gotta be Nick.
[12:07.020 --> 12:09.720]  Oh, you're gonna toss Eric and bash him in the hole?
[12:09.740 --> 12:10.140]  Oh, what the hell?
[12:10.540 --> 12:12.280]  No, the beagles!
[12:12.340 --> 12:12.860]  No!
[12:15.160 --> 12:16.560]  I gotta hide!
[12:17.540 --> 12:18.340]  He's gonna kick your ass!
[12:18.960 --> 12:19.480]  Oh!
[12:20.480 --> 12:21.520]  What happened?
[12:23.660 --> 12:25.220]  Somebody degaussed your magnet.
[12:25.520 --> 12:25.780]  Yep.
[12:26.600 --> 12:29.660]  Ooh, what's a mischievous drone?
[12:29.700 --> 12:30.440]  I'm gonna build that.
[12:32.880 --> 12:34.100]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[12:34.260 --> 12:35.160]  Please let me live.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.200]  Okay, thank you.
[12:36.200 --> 12:38.140]  You're kinda looking at Nutz Gilben a little bit.
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.280]  Are you eyeing Nutz Gilben?
[12:43.800 --> 12:45.300]  Oh my God.
[12:47.680 --> 12:48.160]  Oh!
[12:48.640 --> 12:49.380]  Fire again!
[12:49.800 --> 12:49.900]  Oh.
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.520]  You're fine.
[12:52.540 --> 12:54.500]  I am largely inconsequential this game.
[12:56.540 --> 12:57.920]  Alright, six play game.
[12:58.000 --> 12:58.540]  Me too, man.
[12:59.580 --> 13:00.580]  Well, there's only five of us.
[13:01.720 --> 13:02.540]  Don't you dare.
[13:02.540 --> 13:03.900]  Not for much longer.
[13:12.260 --> 13:13.540]  Leave yourself alone.
[13:14.920 --> 13:16.020]  What's your plan?
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.440]  This is the plan, right?
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.120]  He's a big rope.
[13:19.220 --> 13:20.320]  I do this.
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.040]  And then I drop this.
[13:24.140 --> 13:26.560]  Now this is the thing you're classically good at, right?
[13:26.920 --> 13:28.980]  Oh yeah, he's the best at rope drop.
[13:29.940 --> 13:30.880]  No, you idiot!
[13:31.420 --> 13:31.880]  What?
[13:31.880 --> 13:32.060]  What?
[13:34.520 --> 13:35.760]  I'm still...
[13:36.250 --> 13:37.960]  So what was the plan?
[13:38.700 --> 13:40.420]  I was trying to rope out.
[13:40.720 --> 13:41.620]  I was trying to rope out of that.
[13:42.260 --> 13:42.940]  No, Matrix!
[13:45.160 --> 13:46.100]  Matrix lives.
[13:46.100 --> 13:47.540]  Keep my vehicle alive!
[13:50.600 --> 13:51.040]  Oh!
[13:51.860 --> 13:53.840]  He's hot. He's real hot.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.720]  There we go.
[14:00.380 --> 14:00.860]  Hmm.
[14:02.420 --> 14:04.020]  What could I do here?
[14:04.220 --> 14:04.960]  What could you do?
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.040]  That's a good question.
[14:06.580 --> 14:07.220]  I want to evaluate.
[14:07.840 --> 14:08.380]  Use a drone?
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.960]  We could punch him. Hit him with a baseball bat.
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.120]  That works too?
[14:15.380 --> 14:16.200]  Oh my god.
[14:16.220 --> 14:17.500]  Why would you jump in front of it?
[14:18.140 --> 14:19.100]  What are you doing?
[14:19.200 --> 14:20.400]  Stop! What am I doing?
[14:21.960 --> 14:22.920]  You're crazy.
[14:23.500 --> 14:26.180]  I practiced before this.
[14:26.180 --> 14:27.120]  Did you really?
[14:28.840 --> 14:30.020]  I practiced jumping.
[14:30.320 --> 14:31.560]  I forgot.
[14:32.540 --> 14:33.380]  Oh, come on boys.
[14:33.400 --> 14:34.060]  What does that mean?
[14:34.880 --> 14:35.480]  Here we go.
[14:37.420 --> 14:40.100]  I was bad at jumping last time.
[14:40.220 --> 14:40.820]  Much like this.
[14:42.940 --> 14:45.080]  Turn around. Look the other way.
[14:45.200 --> 14:46.120]  You have to help him.
[14:46.700 --> 14:47.660]  It's not working for me.
[14:47.740 --> 14:49.880]  You can backflip over stuff.
[14:50.840 --> 14:53.300]  I don't know why we've all of a sudden become a helpful company.
[14:53.640 --> 14:54.100]  What are we doing?
[14:54.100 --> 14:56.260]  We've been saying that since the first one.
[15:00.740 --> 15:03.500]  You know what that means.
[15:04.220 --> 15:04.820]  It's drone time.
[15:06.680 --> 15:08.680]  I'm not a mischievous drone.
[15:09.300 --> 15:10.600]  Shoot a rocket into himself.
[15:13.820 --> 15:15.020]  What happened?
[15:15.580 --> 15:16.900]  I didn't even press a button.
[15:18.360 --> 15:20.280]  It fell through the world.
[15:20.400 --> 15:22.140]  You forgot to charge the battery.
[15:26.460 --> 15:27.840]  We're trying that again.
[15:27.840 --> 15:28.700]  We're trying it again.
[15:28.700 --> 15:30.100]  I'm building another fucking drone.
[15:30.500 --> 15:32.660]  That must have been that GoPro drone they made.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.200]  What the hell?
[15:40.880 --> 15:42.260]  Andrew's hitting buttons.
[15:42.840 --> 15:43.940]  I'm just mashing.
[15:44.780 --> 15:45.320]  Going down.
[15:45.860 --> 15:46.440]  Here he comes.
[15:47.680 --> 15:49.080]  What a touchdown.
[15:49.460 --> 15:50.280]  He's going back.
[15:50.780 --> 15:51.640]  He's not making it.
[15:51.640 --> 15:53.020]  Right there.
[15:55.220 --> 15:56.100]  That's a vehicle.
[15:56.300 --> 15:57.800]  How did that not work?
[15:58.080 --> 15:58.800]  It's a vehicle mine.
[16:02.580 --> 16:04.980]  Did you just assume you were dead there?
[16:05.180 --> 16:05.940]  No way.
[16:06.160 --> 16:07.000]  I'm sorry.
[16:07.100 --> 16:09.960]  I'm sorry.
[16:09.960 --> 16:10.420]  He's dying.
[16:15.980 --> 16:22.140]  I had a six player game.
[16:22.280 --> 16:23.240]  I lost two worlds.
[16:28.340 --> 16:30.440]  Nothing even happened.
[16:31.400 --> 16:33.900]  Why did shit happen on the left?
[16:36.120 --> 16:38.100]  I launched them across the map
[16:38.100 --> 16:40.540]  into the automated turret that Nick put down.
[16:42.760 --> 16:44.020]  I'm so sorry.
[16:44.480 --> 16:46.100]  That was crazy.
[16:47.820 --> 16:51.400]  Why on my screen is Geoff's team Gavino free?
[16:52.780 --> 16:53.080]  I don't know.
[16:53.100 --> 16:54.680]  What is your problem then?
[16:54.820 --> 16:57.860]  On my screen, Geoff's is yours.
[16:57.860 --> 16:59.000]  No, what is that?
[16:59.360 --> 16:59.680]  Really?
[17:00.360 --> 17:01.880]  Oh my god.
[17:02.480 --> 17:04.380]  I killed myself.
[17:04.380 --> 17:04.860]  Boys.
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.120]  On my screen it says Gavino free is one of the teams.
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.640]  How dare you.
[17:17.080 --> 17:18.600]  Don't use my fudge. It's confusing.
[17:20.700 --> 17:22.600]  Can I move all this turret?
[17:24.500 --> 17:26.280]  You're pinned between two turrets.
[17:26.440 --> 17:27.280]  It's not ideal.
[17:27.980 --> 17:29.740]  This will get me out of a pickle.
[17:30.500 --> 17:31.240]  What does that do?
[17:31.240 --> 17:32.820]  That's not great for...
[17:33.640 --> 17:35.880]  It depends on how accurately it's applied.
[17:38.740 --> 17:44.720]  So much is happening.
[17:45.340 --> 17:47.080]  What's going on? I missed everything.
[17:48.660 --> 17:51.980]  Did the buttons change between times?
[17:51.980 --> 17:52.800]  Did I die?
[17:53.760 --> 17:55.240]  Jump with...
[17:55.240 --> 17:56.140]  I jumped.
[17:57.040 --> 17:57.360]  No.
[18:01.540 --> 18:03.360]  What's going on?
[18:04.060 --> 18:05.620]  Are you still alive?
[18:06.300 --> 18:07.320]  No, he's dead.
[18:07.520 --> 18:08.540]  What the hell?
[18:09.020 --> 18:09.900]  Leave my tricks alone.
[18:10.880 --> 18:12.380]  Oh, everybody's dying.
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.920]  I don't know why I can't figure the buttons out.
[18:23.560 --> 18:25.420]  Remember when you questioned my grenade, Gavin?
[18:25.420 --> 18:26.560]  God, man.
[18:30.280 --> 18:33.420]  Is everybody on this island dead except for me and SignFetch?
[18:33.560 --> 18:39.760]  I guess my turret's gone too. God damn it.
[18:46.720 --> 18:47.680]  No, SignFetch!
[18:48.960 --> 18:49.920]  Oh my god.
[18:50.660 --> 18:51.920]  You're gonna hit him over the hole.
[18:52.480 --> 18:53.180]  Make it. Make it.
[18:53.740 --> 18:55.400]  No, SignFetch!
[19:01.310 --> 19:03.570]  I think it's up to my tricks.
[19:05.350 --> 19:06.430]  Don't mess with Compy.
[19:08.810 --> 19:09.250]  Compy.
[19:13.520 --> 19:14.880]  That's a long way away.
[19:15.400 --> 19:15.980]  Oh, hell yeah.
[19:22.500 --> 19:23.380]  Oh, no!
[19:25.200 --> 19:28.160]  You're just taking it to us to thump each other with this thing.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.400]  Well, he's dead on the next turn, Eric.
[19:33.460 --> 19:34.040]  Unless you run.
[19:39.630 --> 19:40.310]  Where's Gavin?
[19:40.530 --> 19:42.690]  This is the worst game of worms.
[19:43.310 --> 19:43.830]  Where's Gavin?
[19:44.350 --> 19:45.870]  I think it's because there's five of us.
[19:46.990 --> 19:47.910]  I don't care.
[19:48.450 --> 19:50.830]  Gavin, I don't care.
[19:51.850 --> 19:53.170]  Gavin's all the way at the top.
[19:53.890 --> 19:55.150]  Oh, no!
[19:55.530 --> 19:56.970]  Don't hit the button!
[19:58.230 --> 19:59.510]  Oh, I just hit him in the abs!
[20:00.610 --> 20:02.250]  No, my tricks!
[20:02.630 --> 20:03.890]  I had no choice. I'm sorry.
[20:03.890 --> 20:06.330]  I had no choice.
[20:07.410 --> 20:07.910]  I'm so mad.
[20:08.070 --> 20:10.250]  Gavin, upload your footage from yesterday
[20:10.250 --> 20:11.910]  that I told you to, that you said you did.
[20:12.050 --> 20:12.550]  You didn't.
[20:12.650 --> 20:14.850]  No, you didn't.
[20:16.150 --> 20:17.030]  You didn't!
[20:17.170 --> 20:18.970]  The agreement has been extended.
[20:22.090 --> 20:22.930]  It's not there.
[20:25.170 --> 20:26.370]  Oh, maybe my Google Drive
[20:26.370 --> 20:26.770]  got full.
[20:28.210 --> 20:31.870]  Oh, is this a barbecue sheep?
[20:31.870 --> 20:34.250]  This company sucks.
[20:34.430 --> 20:36.070]  He's shitting fire.
[20:40.270 --> 20:43.010]  I mean, it looks really cool, though.
[20:43.430 --> 20:43.990]  He's coming back.
[20:44.730 --> 20:46.190]  Oh, he's coming back! Look out, everybody!
[20:46.730 --> 20:47.730]  No, no, no, no, no, my tricks!
[20:48.210 --> 20:48.610]  My tricks!
[20:49.490 --> 20:51.310]  Oh, he's stuck!
[20:51.650 --> 20:53.310]  Oh, no, my tricks.
[20:56.210 --> 20:58.710]  And that's how you barbecue a sheep.
[20:59.150 --> 21:00.570]  Yep, I'm out.
[21:02.550 --> 21:03.010]  And...
[21:03.010 --> 21:04.230]  Fourth place.
[21:04.410 --> 21:05.890]  Boom! Bye-bye!
[21:06.450 --> 21:07.350]  Right into the water!
[21:07.690 --> 21:10.530]  No! Holy shit!
[21:12.910 --> 21:14.450]  You still got the beagles, Eric?
[21:15.290 --> 21:16.290]  Do I? Oh, that's right.
[21:17.110 --> 21:18.070]  Yeah, that's right.
[21:20.550 --> 21:21.950]  Man, Geoff's got a lot of wormage.
[21:22.150 --> 21:23.170]  Hey, shut up over there.
[21:23.430 --> 21:28.630]  Oh, whose turret is this?
[21:29.510 --> 21:30.350]  Oh, dear.
[21:30.810 --> 21:31.590]  Jump in front, find out.
[21:36.110 --> 21:37.350]  Send them flying.
[21:38.090 --> 21:38.770]  What's in here?
[21:41.090 --> 21:41.610]  Okay.
[21:42.670 --> 21:44.190]  Got some good info here.
[21:45.730 --> 21:46.190]  Oh, yeah?
[21:50.110 --> 21:51.070]  Oh, no.
[21:52.030 --> 21:53.150]  Okay, now, where's this
[21:53.150 --> 21:54.130]  going to go?
[21:55.890 --> 21:56.410]  Soft.
[21:57.110 --> 21:57.630]  Soft.
[21:57.630 --> 21:57.890]  Soft.
[21:59.310 --> 22:00.390]  There you go.
[22:00.570 --> 22:01.890]  There you go.
[22:04.070 --> 22:06.030]  Oh, into the fire!
[22:06.450 --> 22:07.210]  Oh, no!
[22:07.410 --> 22:10.310]  I didn't know you could even fall through that.
[22:11.310 --> 22:13.070]  86, holy shit.
[22:13.090 --> 22:14.330]  That's less than I would've thought.
[22:14.970 --> 22:15.650]  Yeah, me too.
[22:17.030 --> 22:18.190]  18 stories.
[22:20.070 --> 22:20.650]  Comfy.
[22:24.090 --> 22:25.450]  Just like that.
[22:25.450 --> 22:27.750]  Rocket jump. Attack the earth.
[22:30.370 --> 22:31.970]  Oh, yeah, rocket, that would be great.
[22:32.070 --> 22:32.570]  Do a grenade jump.
[22:33.830 --> 22:35.170]  Little gap there you could go.
[22:39.000 --> 22:39.800]  I mean...
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.060]  Wow, what a toss!
[22:42.180 --> 22:43.260]  Oh, holy shit!
[22:43.380 --> 22:44.420]  That was almost really good.
[22:44.620 --> 22:45.920]  That was almost really good, Nick.
[22:46.500 --> 22:49.060]  I would still say that was pretty good, but
[22:49.060 --> 22:50.160]  man, that could've been great.
[22:51.080 --> 22:52.220]  It counts as a hand grenade.
[22:52.800 --> 22:54.380]  Alright, here's my munitions boost.
[22:54.380 --> 22:56.300]  I'm definitely right there.
[22:58.940 --> 22:59.920]  Go get it.
[23:02.640 --> 23:04.040]  Oh, you're gonna get so much health!
[23:05.240 --> 23:06.020]  Get the other one!
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.460]  Oh, there is another one. Thank God.
[23:07.780 --> 23:08.780]  This can walk on water, too.
[23:09.800 --> 23:11.620]  Yeah, then take a step onto that mine down there.
[23:13.300 --> 23:14.260]  Doesn't work on vehicles.
[23:14.820 --> 23:16.840]  You knocked yourself out of the mech!
[23:17.080 --> 23:18.220]  No, no, I jumped out of the mech.
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.120]  That was crazy.
[23:20.700 --> 23:22.240]  It was timed so well.
[23:22.240 --> 23:24.260]  Thank you.
[23:26.240 --> 23:27.420]  What do you need to do?
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.480]  Figuring it out.
[23:32.040 --> 23:33.160]  Oh, dear.
[23:34.200 --> 23:35.740]  I've got one worm!
[23:36.360 --> 23:38.160]  What are you doing?
[23:42.120 --> 23:42.760]  Oh!
[23:43.880 --> 23:43.980]  Holy shit!
[23:45.500 --> 23:46.540]  Stop!
[23:48.300 --> 23:49.780]  Holy shit!
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.740]  Oh my God!
[23:51.740 --> 23:54.740]  That was huge!
[23:55.240 --> 23:55.400]  Yeah.
[23:56.160 --> 23:57.680]  That was the Mega Buster.
[23:58.380 --> 24:00.640]  That was pretty great.
[24:01.000 --> 24:01.580]  Thank you.
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.200]  AHHHHHHHH!
[24:09.280 --> 24:11.220]  God damn it!
[24:13.660 --> 24:14.500]  Fuck!
[24:15.480 --> 24:16.960]  And another health!
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.180]  Where I was going?
[24:22.920 --> 24:24.680]  It's time for INSANE!
[24:28.620 --> 24:29.560]  What are you doing there, Geoff?
[24:29.620 --> 24:30.920]  He's trying, I think, for the crate.
[24:31.420 --> 24:32.060]  Shut up!
[24:36.740 --> 24:37.320]  Oh, okay.
[24:38.580 --> 24:39.400]  I was just inquiring.
[24:40.820 --> 24:41.100]  Uh oh.
[24:43.260 --> 24:44.920]  Gavin's up and to the right a little bit from where you were.
[24:45.340 --> 24:45.760]  Yeah.
[24:46.580 --> 24:47.900]  Probably the other direction, too.
[24:48.100 --> 24:49.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:49.940 --> 24:50.640]  No, no, no, no.
[24:52.800 --> 24:55.340]  That's my last one, man! Don't do it!
[24:55.740 --> 24:57.160]  Everybody's gotta lose their last one
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.140]  eventually, but me. Might as well happen now.
[24:59.640 --> 24:59.920]  Oh!
[25:02.160 --> 25:03.280]  Wow, I didn't...
[25:03.280 --> 25:05.200]  Dude, I cannot believe I haven't finished in the last...
[25:05.200 --> 25:05.960]  This is so crazy.
[25:06.120 --> 25:07.060]  What a comeback for me.
[25:10.100 --> 25:10.900]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[25:11.380 --> 25:11.740]  Yeah.
[25:13.680 --> 25:16.860]  Yeah, real happy for you.
[25:17.040 --> 25:18.380]  Yeah, real pleased.
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.300]  What's the plan here, Gavin?
[25:20.260 --> 25:22.100]  Well, a while ago, I built a
[25:22.880 --> 25:24.220]  Ninja Rope Pro.
[25:24.500 --> 25:26.420]  So let's see if I can use that.
[25:26.420 --> 25:28.140]  Yeah, let's see. I'm excited to see.
[25:29.380 --> 25:29.740]  Oh, shit.
[25:32.760 --> 25:34.660]  Okay, I'm not sure what was different.
[25:34.760 --> 25:36.120]  Oh, God, I'm tying the map in a knot.
[25:37.000 --> 25:37.700]  Okay, there we go.
[25:37.700 --> 25:38.340]  Oh.
[25:39.220 --> 25:40.300]  Oh, keep going.
[25:40.300 --> 25:43.680]  There you go. That's it right there.
[25:43.880 --> 25:44.660]  Boom, baby.
[25:45.900 --> 25:46.560]  Get those parts.
[25:48.160 --> 25:49.140]  Gavin, eight.
[25:49.640 --> 25:50.100]  Seven.
[25:51.200 --> 25:52.220]  Alright, now what's the plan, Gavin?
[25:55.300 --> 25:55.900]  No!
[25:57.380 --> 25:57.720]  Why?
[26:00.500 --> 26:03.160]  Oh, my God.
[26:03.760 --> 26:05.260]  Oh, my God.
[26:05.260 --> 26:07.880]  What were you trying to do?
[26:07.940 --> 26:09.200]  I was trying to blow up
[26:09.200 --> 26:10.740]  this. I was trying to blow up that
[26:10.740 --> 26:12.740]  and the vehicle mine and hopefully just
[26:12.740 --> 26:13.620]  toss Geoff out.
[26:15.880 --> 26:16.860]  But instead, I
[26:16.860 --> 26:19.040]  pressed jump and instead...
[26:20.540 --> 26:21.020]  Gavin
[26:21.620 --> 26:23.360]  is lined up to get hit
[26:23.360 --> 26:24.580]  in this take two by Eric.
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.160]  No, but look. Look at how much health Andrew
[26:27.160 --> 26:27.780]  and Geoff have.
[26:28.960 --> 26:30.260]  I'm aiming at Geoff.
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.220]  Look, I'm protected by the metal hand.
[26:33.220 --> 26:34.780]  Uh-oh.
[26:36.740 --> 26:37.220]  Alright.
[26:37.980 --> 26:39.600]  I mean, fuck that.
[26:40.200 --> 26:41.160]  Fuck that.
[26:45.850 --> 26:46.810]  That sucked.
[26:47.450 --> 26:48.150]  Well played.
[26:48.270 --> 26:50.830]  Look how close to that vehicle mine that bunker buster was.
[26:50.950 --> 26:51.190]  Yep.
[26:52.870 --> 26:53.870]  I was trying for it.
[26:54.290 --> 26:56.610]  I was trying to get in between them.
[26:56.690 --> 26:58.810]  I'll hit both of them. I didn't think it was going to keep
[26:58.810 --> 27:00.510]  burrowing and then it kept burrowing.
[27:01.150 --> 27:02.710]  There's so much health over there.
[27:04.870 --> 27:05.410]  Let's see.
[27:05.570 --> 27:08.870]  Let's see. What do I got?
[27:09.790 --> 27:10.630]  Give it a shot.
[27:10.710 --> 27:12.170]  Not a whole lot that I like.
[27:13.410 --> 27:14.530]  Yeah, here we go.
[27:20.940 --> 27:22.220]  Uh-oh.
[27:23.220 --> 27:23.800]  That's rough.
[27:24.960 --> 27:25.560]  No!
[27:27.420 --> 27:27.740]  No!
[27:29.080 --> 27:29.400]  No!
[27:31.780 --> 27:33.060]  I win!
[27:33.060 --> 27:33.840]  Oh, God!
[27:36.340 --> 27:37.040]  I'm hurt.
[27:37.640 --> 27:39.600]  Oh, no. You killed me.
[27:39.800 --> 27:40.680]  Oh, Eric's down.
[27:40.680 --> 27:42.440]  That's it for the Beagles. Fourth place.
[27:44.640 --> 27:46.300]  Is that it? Okay.
[27:47.180 --> 27:48.940]  Wow, you lived? That's insane.
[27:51.340 --> 27:53.100]  I can't tell if the 18's
[27:53.100 --> 27:55.140]  my health or the 2. I don't know what to do.
[27:57.120 --> 27:57.320]  No!
[28:01.320 --> 28:02.140]  No!
[28:03.260 --> 28:04.080]  No!
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.040]  Yes!
[28:08.260 --> 28:11.020]  What are you doing?
[28:17.440 --> 28:19.080]  You're crazy.
[28:19.460 --> 28:20.520]  You're a crazy person.
[28:21.750 --> 28:23.340]  So, Geoff is up there to your left.
[28:23.500 --> 28:24.720]  Andrew's just down below.
[28:24.720 --> 28:25.180]  No!
[28:28.100 --> 28:28.700]  What?
[28:29.760 --> 28:30.900]  Try again, buddy.
[28:31.320 --> 28:32.060]  Go ahead.
[28:33.780 --> 28:35.380]  Is that a jet pack I heard?
[28:35.520 --> 28:35.860]  Yeah.
[28:36.520 --> 28:39.200]  I was trying to backflip.
[28:42.560 --> 28:43.300]  Oh, my God.
[28:43.440 --> 28:43.800]  No!
[28:44.340 --> 28:47.020]  That was totally cut off.
[28:47.160 --> 28:47.480]  There you go.
[28:49.740 --> 28:50.340]  Nice.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.280]  Great job.
[28:55.840 --> 28:57.040]  Where are you going?
[28:57.640 --> 28:58.260]  Where did you go?
[28:58.300 --> 29:00.240]  One of these?
[29:00.900 --> 29:02.160]  How do I turn?
[29:03.740 --> 29:04.600]  Do it quick!
[29:05.460 --> 29:06.740]  He missed.
[29:07.680 --> 29:09.080]  Miss, miss, miss.
[29:09.480 --> 29:11.100]  He missed!
[29:11.460 --> 29:12.180]  He missed!
[29:14.320 --> 29:14.380]  Geoff!
[29:16.720 --> 29:17.680]  You missed!
[29:20.280 --> 29:22.500]  I'm having a nightmare
[29:22.500 --> 29:23.160]  of a game.
[29:24.140 --> 29:24.820]  Oh, yeah?
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.700]  It's all your fault anyway. It doesn't matter.
[29:30.320 --> 29:31.360]  Oh, he's going to be
[29:31.940 --> 29:32.700]  full of health.
[29:33.380 --> 29:34.720]  Living forever here, baby.
[29:35.580 --> 29:36.420]  Oh, drop.
[29:37.940 --> 29:38.780]  Oh, nice.
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.060]  Go for it.
[29:41.700 --> 29:42.560]  Do it.
[29:43.680 --> 29:44.140]  It's right there.
[29:47.940 --> 29:48.960]  There you go.
[29:49.180 --> 29:50.140]  There you go.
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.440]  All right, now go insane mode.
[29:52.820 --> 29:54.420]  There's a turret down there!
[29:57.420 --> 29:58.020]  Okay.
[30:00.000 --> 30:00.600]  Okay.
[30:01.500 --> 30:02.080]  Now what?
[30:04.040 --> 30:05.340]  Come on, man.
[30:05.680 --> 30:06.680]  Four seconds.
[30:07.260 --> 30:08.080]  Two seconds!
[30:08.800 --> 30:10.020]  Why would you do that?
[30:12.680 --> 30:13.340]  Oh, wow.
[30:14.120 --> 30:15.680]  How did you escape that?
[30:15.980 --> 30:16.540]  I don't know.
[30:16.540 --> 30:17.480]  It's not gone off yet.
[30:17.540 --> 30:18.220]  I don't know.
[30:20.200 --> 30:21.800]  Is that a proximity thing?
[30:22.400 --> 30:24.720]  Geoff, bust some bunkers, dude.
[30:25.140 --> 30:25.900]  I'm going to have to.
[30:25.960 --> 30:27.220]  I don't know where Gavin is, though.
[30:27.460 --> 30:28.920]  I can't quite see him.
[30:30.560 --> 30:32.220]  You can't see in there.
[30:33.220 --> 30:35.260]  Get the mines above him, maybe.
[30:35.580 --> 30:36.120]  Oh, no.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.100]  Oh, no.
[30:40.860 --> 30:43.080]  It doesn't blow up the vehicle mine?
[30:43.300 --> 30:43.580]  Really?
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.580]  Oh, wow. That's crazy.
[30:46.000 --> 30:46.560]  Damn.
[30:50.380 --> 30:51.780]  There he is.
[30:56.820 --> 30:58.760]  Why has his name disappeared?
[30:59.200 --> 31:00.140]  Why is his name not there?
[31:00.200 --> 31:00.840]  He's hacking.
[31:01.720 --> 31:03.040]  Oh, he's cheating.
[31:03.420 --> 31:06.740]  That's why he only wanted to play four players before.
[31:13.740 --> 31:15.400]  Well, surely this time.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.220]  Oh, shit.
[31:19.220 --> 31:19.660]  Oh, my God.
[31:20.040 --> 31:21.260]  Oh, shit.
[31:21.420 --> 31:23.820]  Oh, shit.
[31:24.320 --> 31:25.440]  Oh, shit.
[31:25.820 --> 31:27.080]  It's going everywhere.
[31:30.680 --> 31:33.520]  That was way beyond my control.
[31:34.140 --> 31:35.900]  That was great.
[31:36.780 --> 31:37.260]  Everyone alright?
[31:38.060 --> 31:38.200]  Yeah.
[31:39.340 --> 31:41.260]  Oh, my God.
[31:42.440 --> 31:44.860]  Did that throw me into the open?
[31:45.580 --> 31:46.060]  Yep.
[31:46.580 --> 31:47.060]  Shit.
[31:49.220 --> 31:50.180]  I'm down.
[31:52.220 --> 31:52.980]  Alright, Andrew.
[31:53.040 --> 31:54.540]  You got a pretty clear shot at Gavin now.
[31:55.840 --> 31:56.320]  Yeah?
[31:57.980 --> 31:58.640]  Do I?
[31:59.080 --> 32:00.420]  Yeah, bust that bunker, baby.
[32:01.820 --> 32:03.000]  There's a giant wall.
[32:03.820 --> 32:04.460]  There's a lot of walls.
[32:05.020 --> 32:06.380]  Yeah, you'd use a different item.
[32:07.260 --> 32:08.840]  I'm aware of different items.
[32:09.080 --> 32:09.960]  Stupid, I'm just saying.
[32:10.160 --> 32:13.140]  It is a clear shot.
[32:13.140 --> 32:14.260]  No, it's not.
[32:14.760 --> 32:16.580]  This guy's nuts.
[32:17.040 --> 32:18.320]  This guy's insane.
[32:18.880 --> 32:21.920]  Andrew, we're telling you that we believe in you.
[32:22.380 --> 32:24.240]  We're telling you that we believe in you.
[32:24.340 --> 32:25.340]  And you're going, nah, I don't think so.
[32:25.960 --> 32:26.840]  Well, I don't.
[32:27.180 --> 32:28.060]  You're crazy.
[32:28.300 --> 32:30.680]  You're crazy for doing this.
[32:31.060 --> 32:32.020]  That's going to kill you.
[32:33.700 --> 32:34.500]  What did you do that?
[32:34.500 --> 32:35.800]  I mean, it didn't do a whole lot.
[32:36.220 --> 32:37.660]  Oh, my God.
[32:38.400 --> 32:39.960]  That was mainly a negative on me.
[32:39.960 --> 32:42.720]  Why did you do that?
[32:42.800 --> 32:45.400]  I just thought I'd really rip this fucking place up.
[32:45.500 --> 32:47.100]  Let's tear down some walls.
[32:47.360 --> 32:48.320]  I mean, you kind of did.
[32:52.720 --> 32:56.560]  I really thought I'd do more damage to Kurt Gunderbag in that one.
[32:58.360 --> 33:01.100]  Oh, my God.
[33:01.780 --> 33:05.000]  Let's see what happens when we do.
[33:07.860 --> 33:09.060]  He's got the most health.
[33:10.020 --> 33:10.620]  Oh.
[33:11.040 --> 33:12.340]  It's a W1.
[33:12.640 --> 33:13.280]  Oh, I love it.
[33:13.360 --> 33:17.080]  It comes down next turn.
[33:17.500 --> 33:18.700]  Yep, I love this one.
[33:19.080 --> 33:20.340]  Well, I should probably leave.
[33:21.600 --> 33:22.980]  Oh, Andrew's crafting.
[33:23.580 --> 33:24.200]  Sure am.
[33:24.780 --> 33:25.960]  Better get a plan together, bud.
[33:30.280 --> 33:30.880]  Alright.
[33:31.960 --> 33:32.780]  Here we go.
[33:36.770 --> 33:37.530]  Alright, just
[33:37.530 --> 33:39.310]  chuck something good over there.
[33:41.030 --> 33:42.230]  Like, maybe...
[33:44.890 --> 33:45.590]  Holy heck.
[33:45.790 --> 33:46.270]  One of these.
[33:46.870 --> 33:49.070]  Every time there's a toss, it makes me so nervous.
[33:49.210 --> 33:50.410]  It's just like, this is not good.
[33:51.070 --> 33:52.490]  I mean, you're dead. What does it matter?
[33:54.930 --> 33:55.330]  No.
[33:55.690 --> 33:55.890]  No.
[33:56.930 --> 33:57.330]  Oh!
[33:59.590 --> 34:00.390]  Oh, no.
[34:00.830 --> 34:01.570]  Oh, my God.
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.070]  Oh!
[34:06.670 --> 34:07.510]  How did the fire miss?
[34:07.510 --> 34:09.170]  Can you guys stop for one turn?
[34:11.090 --> 34:12.510]  How did that miss me?
[34:12.510 --> 34:13.850]  Oh, my God!
[34:14.470 --> 34:15.110]  That's crazy.
[34:16.170 --> 34:18.070]  I can't believe you're alive right now.
[34:18.630 --> 34:20.570]  Or at least, as unharmed as you are.
[34:24.050 --> 34:25.410]  Do I have my stuff?
[34:25.630 --> 34:25.930]  No!
[34:28.270 --> 34:28.550]  Here.
[34:30.230 --> 34:32.330]  Look at the foolish shit, my friends.
[34:39.270 --> 34:40.690]  How are we
[34:40.690 --> 34:41.970]  all this bad at worms?
[34:42.350 --> 34:42.550]  How?
[34:43.910 --> 34:45.370]  This is unreal.
[34:45.730 --> 34:48.670]  We didn't think we could play it that much because it's only four players.
[34:49.550 --> 34:50.090]  No!
[34:51.830 --> 34:52.910]  Please stop!
[34:56.790 --> 34:58.870]  I did so much planning!
[34:58.870 --> 34:59.110]  I did so much planning!
[35:03.890 --> 35:10.770]  Oh, I didn't get to use any of the stuff I built.
[35:13.490 --> 35:15.830]  It's time for Gunderberg.
[35:17.230 --> 35:17.910]  Gunderbag.
[35:18.370 --> 35:18.830]  Whatever.
[35:21.910 --> 35:23.750]  Alright, do I have a little torch?
[35:24.790 --> 35:25.930]  Blow torch.
[35:25.930 --> 35:27.670]  Oh, wow!
[35:28.350 --> 35:29.030]  Wow!
[35:31.010 --> 35:35.930]  He's going to push him into the water.
[35:36.850 --> 35:38.190]  Oh, he lived!
[35:38.790 --> 35:39.670]  And then he broke.
[35:40.190 --> 35:41.630]  Rise, sea levels!
[35:42.570 --> 35:43.070]  Rise!
[35:45.830 --> 35:46.790]  Drown him!
[35:48.350 --> 35:48.930]  Uh-oh!
[35:49.770 --> 35:50.930]  Uh-oh!
[35:51.090 --> 35:52.550]  It's time for insane!
[35:52.550 --> 35:52.610]  Insane!
[35:54.530 --> 35:57.210]  How about we end this with some flair, Gavin?
[35:57.330 --> 35:57.510]  Yep.
[35:57.930 --> 35:58.710]  With an airstrike?
[35:58.950 --> 36:00.870]  Oh my god!
[36:01.550 --> 36:01.710]  No!
[36:04.590 --> 36:05.950]  Oh my god!
[36:07.570 --> 36:07.930]  Uh-oh.
[36:08.210 --> 36:09.670]  Oh, Geoff, I think you got hit too.
[36:10.130 --> 36:11.010]  No, Geoff wins.
[36:11.390 --> 36:12.550]  He's good, he's done it.
[36:12.590 --> 36:13.430]  He's fine.
[36:14.930 --> 36:15.910]  Goodbye, Kirk.
[36:16.350 --> 36:18.990]  Like it was always supposed to happen.
[36:18.990 --> 36:21.030]  And Geoff wins Worms.
[36:21.150 --> 36:24.810]  We didn't want to make a big deal out of it before we started,
[36:24.930 --> 36:26.890]  but that was our official Worms Super Bowl.
[36:27.050 --> 36:31.790]  We determined that the winner would be the Worms Super Bowl champion for the next year.
[36:31.910 --> 36:35.190]  If we ever do it again, we might just leave it as a permanent best of all time.
[36:35.190 --> 36:38.810]  Oh, I want to play Worms way more often.
[36:39.030 --> 36:40.190]  Hold on, let me put the crown on my head.
[36:40.270 --> 36:40.970]  There it is, it's on my head.
[36:42.630 --> 36:47.410]  Knowing that we can play five player, I want to play Worms all the time.
[36:47.410 --> 36:50.690]  Why did we only play four player?
[36:51.030 --> 36:55.210]  Hey, Eric, if this blew you away, just imagine what else Gavin's holding out on.
[36:55.330 --> 36:56.170]  Yes, exactly.
[36:56.630 --> 36:59.630]  You know what else Gavin is holding out on? His fucking footage.
[37:00.010 --> 37:01.330]  Upload your footage.
[37:02.270 --> 37:03.430]  Upload the footage.
[37:04.830 --> 37:07.390]  Well, thanks for watching this Worms.
[37:07.450 --> 37:11.390]  If you want to check out the first 15 minutes of us yelling at Gavin,
[37:11.910 --> 37:13.410]  hopefully we put it on Patreon.
[37:14.250 --> 37:18.450]  It's where Gavin finally reveals that we're able to play five player Worms.
[37:18.710 --> 37:22.250]  And we all yell at him while he's logging into Meg's account.
[37:22.390 --> 37:23.650]  Yeah, why am I getting yelled at?
[37:24.470 --> 37:26.330]  Because you never upload your footage!
[37:26.650 --> 37:26.870]  Because you didn't tell us!
[37:26.910 --> 37:30.650]  We made it so clear. So go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[37:31.010 --> 37:34.370]  Check out the gameplay, check out the podcast, check out everything we're doing.
[37:34.470 --> 37:36.390]  We're going to go stomp on Gavin some more.
[37:36.670 --> 37:37.810]  We'll talk to you later. Bye!
[37:38.590 --> 37:39.010]  Bye!
[37:39.290 --> 37:39.490]  Bye!
