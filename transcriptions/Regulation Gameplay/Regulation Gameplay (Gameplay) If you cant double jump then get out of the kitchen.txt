[00:00.000 --> 00:00.840]  You gotta do better.
[00:01.020 --> 00:01.740]  Avoid the walls.
[00:03.080 --> 00:03.920]  You got... Andrew.
[00:03.940 --> 00:04.920]  Go straight into the lemons.
[00:05.060 --> 00:05.960]  Andrew, you gotta do better.
[00:06.700 --> 00:07.640]  I gotta avoid him.
[00:08.380 --> 00:09.880]  Oh my god, jump over the flower.
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.000]  This is a regular... oof.
[00:14.660 --> 00:15.620]  That's ridiculous!
[00:18.020 --> 00:19.440]  That is insane!
[00:19.860 --> 00:22.300]  Channel your inner Indiana Jones.
[00:22.840 --> 00:23.200]  Jump!
[00:23.840 --> 00:24.780]  I'm jumping!
[00:25.060 --> 00:27.340]  Now don't... this is where you usually die, so don't do it.
[00:27.420 --> 00:28.360]  Yeah, don't do that.
[00:28.360 --> 00:29.720]  Yep, going up, going up.
[00:30.500 --> 00:31.680]  Jump on that thing, it's bouncy.
[00:32.580 --> 00:32.800]  Yep.
[00:34.080 --> 00:35.580]  You didn't bounce high enough, dude.
[00:35.660 --> 00:36.340]  You gotta double jump.
[00:36.640 --> 00:38.320]  Geoff, you wanna tell them about the double jump?
[00:38.360 --> 00:39.940]  I did double... oh my god.
[00:40.160 --> 00:41.860]  You can double jump to get higher.
[00:42.760 --> 00:43.540]  Thanks, Geoff.
[00:43.840 --> 00:43.980]  Yeah.
[00:44.680 --> 00:47.600]  We have to do another one of these with Nick in 15 minutes.
[00:49.980 --> 00:51.620]  Oh my god!
