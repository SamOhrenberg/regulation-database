[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  Well, who's introing this? Is this an Andrew game or what?
[00:02.140 --> 00:03.840]  Who's introing this? Did Andrew pick this?
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.860]  Andrew picked it.
[00:05.060 --> 00:05.920]  Andrew, okay, Andrew, go ahead.
[00:05.920 --> 00:08.360]  Welcome to Peek-A-Park 2! Welcome to Peek-A-Park 2!
[00:08.440 --> 00:09.480]  Are you ready to play some Peek-A-Park 2?
[00:09.560 --> 00:11.100]  This is an all-new game to Peek-A-Park!
[00:11.200 --> 00:13.480]  We're gonna come at you like a level 449!
[00:13.600 --> 00:15.040]  We're in a 499 blah blah blah Peek-A-Park!
[00:15.820 --> 00:20.080]  We're in an era where Andrew makes a choice on something
[00:20.080 --> 00:21.800]  and then will not...
[00:21.800 --> 00:22.820]  go with it.
[00:23.020 --> 00:27.840]  I hope we move into an era where Andrew does, uh...
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.480]  auctions.
[00:28.480 --> 00:31.000]  Yeah, I think you could guess on prop stores next.
[00:31.140 --> 00:31.440]  Auctioneer Andrew, yeah.
[00:32.020 --> 00:34.500]  The thing I can do with Auctioneer Andrew is that
[00:34.500 --> 00:36.900]  I can make all the noises, but I can't, uh,
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.540]  actually say numbers, so...
[00:38.540 --> 00:40.020]  Yeah, there's like no articulation to it.
[00:40.060 --> 00:41.620]  Yeah, it's just noises.
[00:42.060 --> 00:44.680]  Is the auctioneer allowed to bid if he fancies it?
[00:45.340 --> 00:46.560]  Oh! Great question!
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.650]  Going once, going twice, nevermind!
[00:51.980 --> 00:53.580]  Put my own bid in, naughty devil!
[00:54.660 --> 00:57.500]  Um, so we're playing Peek-A-Park 2.
[00:57.500 --> 00:59.440]  We've been deep in Peek-A-Park.
[00:59.620 --> 01:02.200]  It's another day at the park, and we're ready to do this thing.
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.680]  Nick, we got the name burns in?
[01:04.120 --> 01:04.980]  Yeah, dude!
[01:05.180 --> 01:06.140]  Let's do it!
[01:07.580 --> 01:10.100]  Gavin's all sticky from what we were doing earlier with him.
[01:10.320 --> 01:11.020]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:11.440 --> 01:14.000]  Just so we know, let's go over who we are.
[01:14.200 --> 01:15.200]  Andrew is red.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.180]  I'm purple. Eric is green.
[01:17.420 --> 01:19.660]  Geoff is orange. Gavin is blue.
[01:20.180 --> 01:21.020]  Yes. Perfect.
[01:21.220 --> 01:21.480]  Go, go, go!
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.440]  Gavin's blue?
[01:25.440 --> 01:25.840]  Yes.
[01:25.940 --> 01:27.040]  Who'd that come on?
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.440]  I'm just gonna see if there's enough piss rats in the chat.
[01:31.500 --> 01:32.380]  It looks like there is.
[01:32.640 --> 01:33.940]  No, it's more cats, actually.
[01:34.060 --> 01:36.100]  We actually need corn cats in the chat, is what we need.
[01:37.040 --> 01:39.260]  Let's get some corn cats and no more piss rats.
[01:39.800 --> 01:41.360]  Malignant Toaster, thank you very much.
[01:41.560 --> 01:41.820]  Oh!
[01:41.920 --> 01:42.040]  Oh!
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.240]  Am I dead?
[01:46.540 --> 01:47.280]  No, we have to jump!
[01:47.820 --> 01:48.060]  Jump!
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.680]  Why does the screen go ape shit?
[01:50.680 --> 01:51.980]  What do you mean, ape shit?
[01:52.140 --> 01:53.100]  What does that mean?
[01:53.940 --> 01:55.660]  Is that just my...
[01:56.620 --> 01:57.900]  What does that mean?
[01:59.180 --> 02:00.780]  Okay, we get all jumpies.
[02:01.000 --> 02:01.680]  Frickin' hell.
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.200]  Who's not jumping?
[02:05.320 --> 02:06.460]  Probably Nick and Andrew.
[02:06.840 --> 02:08.900]  I'm interested to see if Gavin goes...
[02:08.900 --> 02:10.660]  Yeah, I...
[02:11.900 --> 02:12.940]  Okay, it looks like
[02:12.940 --> 02:14.540]  whoever is greyed out cannot jump.
[02:15.020 --> 02:17.060]  Okay, so who's not jumping?
[02:17.880 --> 02:19.100]  So in that one, I couldn't jump
[02:19.100 --> 02:20.280]  because I was greyed out.
[02:20.420 --> 02:21.820]  So one of the others did not.
[02:21.860 --> 02:23.400]  Okay, I can jump now.
[02:24.820 --> 02:25.340]  Shit!
[02:26.540 --> 02:27.320]  Okay, I can't jump.
[02:28.900 --> 02:30.380]  Gavin, what's wrong?
[02:30.880 --> 02:33.220]  My screen's going nuts!
[02:33.860 --> 02:34.980]  What's the problem?
[02:35.220 --> 02:35.720]  What does that mean?
[02:37.900 --> 02:39.220]  It's got ape shit!
[02:39.780 --> 02:41.540]  My Mac turned off!
[02:41.560 --> 02:43.140]  Okay, so Gavin's just not jumping.
[02:43.640 --> 02:44.980]  I can't see, you idiot!
[02:45.740 --> 02:46.840]  I'll do it!
[02:47.020 --> 02:49.020]  We don't know what you're looking at!
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.620]  When I say jump, Gavin, jump.
[02:50.720 --> 02:50.920]  Okay.
[02:52.520 --> 02:54.160]  Don't worry about it this time.
[02:54.620 --> 02:55.560]  Jump, Gavin!
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.460]  Did I do it?
[02:57.800 --> 02:58.880]  No, you're greyed out.
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.540]  Okay, Gavin, what do we need to do then?
[03:01.580 --> 03:02.420]  Do we need to quit out?
[03:03.980 --> 03:06.220]  I'm just gonna reboot my capture software.
[03:06.760 --> 03:07.080]  What?
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.640]  Oh, Mr. Reboot-ahead-of-time!
[03:09.980 --> 03:12.200]  Look at Mr. Reboot-ahead-of-time!
[03:12.200 --> 03:13.500]  Look, when I was in the middle-
[03:13.500 --> 03:13.760]  No!
[03:15.920 --> 03:17.640]  Okay, we can just drop there.
[03:17.800 --> 03:18.040]  Yup!
[03:22.710 --> 03:23.190]  Gavin!
[03:24.430 --> 03:25.170]  How's it looking?
[03:26.930 --> 03:27.730]  Jump, Gavin!
[03:28.230 --> 03:28.710]  Jump!
[03:30.190 --> 03:31.410]  Did I do it?
[03:31.770 --> 03:32.250]  Nope.
[03:32.410 --> 03:33.230]  We're close.
[03:35.870 --> 03:36.350]  Honestly,
[03:39.610 --> 03:40.730]  Spectropanzer's asked a good question.
[03:40.810 --> 03:42.070]  Did Gavin shit-ahead-of-time or what?
[03:43.230 --> 03:44.190]  Oh yeah, I've shit.
[03:46.230 --> 03:46.970]  There we go!
[03:47.430 --> 03:48.090]  Jump, jump!
[03:48.550 --> 03:49.890]  Drop, drop, drop!
[03:51.630 --> 03:52.070]  Jump!
[03:52.850 --> 03:53.730]  Big jump!
[03:54.310 --> 03:54.750]  Okay!
[03:56.190 --> 03:57.070]  Jump again!
[03:58.150 --> 03:59.250]  Gavin, can you do that?
[04:00.410 --> 04:02.390]  I don't want to run it in safe mode.
[04:02.810 --> 04:03.770]  I'm trying to run it normally.
[04:04.010 --> 04:06.710]  We can just run off that ledge, drop to the key,
[04:06.810 --> 04:07.850]  and then everybody jump after that.
[04:08.190 --> 04:08.870]  I can see!
[04:09.810 --> 04:10.370]  Good!
[04:11.450 --> 04:13.250]  Cool! Welcome to the game, dude!
[04:13.770 --> 04:14.110]  No!
[04:14.610 --> 04:15.170]  Jump!
[04:16.210 --> 04:17.810]  Alright, drop!
[04:18.570 --> 04:19.570]  No jumpies!
[04:23.170 --> 04:23.730]  Drop!
[04:24.290 --> 04:24.670]  No!
[04:25.890 --> 04:27.590]  We didn't drop enough.
[04:27.930 --> 04:28.950]  No, we didn't drop at all!
[04:29.430 --> 04:32.270]  Gavin, are you with us now that we're three minutes in or what?
[04:32.590 --> 04:35.210]  Yeah, I'm not recording anymore, but...
[04:35.210 --> 04:37.170]  I can see.
[04:37.930 --> 04:38.310]  Alright.
[04:39.570 --> 04:40.970]  Okay, so what's your excuse there?
[04:42.230 --> 04:42.730]  He was gray?
[04:42.990 --> 04:44.630]  This is Geoff thinking, one, two, three...
[04:45.530 --> 04:47.270]  Geoff, thank you, but unless
[04:47.270 --> 04:48.470]  it's a joke, in which case, why?
[04:48.690 --> 04:49.710]  No, I did. It's real.
[04:50.850 --> 04:51.790]  Thank you, Geoff.
[04:52.070 --> 04:54.590]  I was gray? I could not jump.
[04:56.430 --> 04:57.230]  Maybe we should
[04:57.230 --> 04:59.210]  go back to Gavin closing his eyes and we'll tell him
[04:59.210 --> 04:59.490]  when to jump.
[04:59.850 --> 05:02.830]  I cannot jump right now.
[05:03.310 --> 05:04.390]  I can't jump now.
[05:04.390 --> 05:05.010]  Yep.
[05:05.750 --> 05:06.650]  I can't jump now.
[05:06.830 --> 05:09.490]  Run normally. I can't see.
[05:09.930 --> 05:11.710]  Alright, cool. So you're just...
[05:12.650 --> 05:13.350]  Reopen.
[05:14.100 --> 05:15.890]  So Gavin isn't even playing the game.
[05:16.830 --> 05:17.530]  Ignore.
[05:17.930 --> 05:18.310]  Reopen.
[05:18.690 --> 05:20.750]  This is awful.
[05:23.990 --> 05:26.870]  What happened to my stuff?
[05:27.530 --> 05:29.070]  How is there someone...
[05:29.070 --> 05:30.610]  How is there someone
[05:30.610 --> 05:31.530]  in the chat saying...
[05:31.530 --> 05:33.550]  It's always Eric's fault, I swear to God.
[05:33.650 --> 05:35.150]  Are you a maniac?
[05:36.150 --> 05:38.270]  What are you talking about?
[05:38.510 --> 05:39.110]  One, two, three.
[05:40.730 --> 05:41.970]  You talk about all the problems
[05:41.970 --> 05:43.670]  of gameplay at Achievement Hunter,
[05:43.850 --> 05:45.470]  Geoff. Gavin has the most problems
[05:45.470 --> 05:46.610]  out of all of us by like six.
[05:47.150 --> 05:48.390]  Do you think it's just Gavin?
[05:49.430 --> 05:50.490]  I'm here for that.
[05:51.870 --> 05:52.750]  Now jumpy.
[05:53.270 --> 05:53.810]  Now jumpy.
[05:55.330 --> 05:56.210]  Now jumpy.
[05:56.270 --> 05:58.370]  That was so close.
[05:58.370 --> 06:00.030]  On my screen, we made it.
[06:00.290 --> 06:01.030]  That's bullshit.
[06:02.310 --> 06:03.790]  Did we get the key?
[06:04.330 --> 06:05.150]  We did not.
[06:05.310 --> 06:06.690]  That was the issue.
[06:06.830 --> 06:08.770]  We reached it.
[06:08.970 --> 06:10.510]  What are these sticks about?
[06:13.630 --> 06:16.170]  You would think they'd be checkpoints, but they don't act like them.
[06:16.590 --> 06:17.690]  They're not checkpoints.
[06:17.890 --> 06:19.290]  It's where it switches who can jump.
[06:20.050 --> 06:21.230]  They're switch points.
[06:21.790 --> 06:22.750]  That's so smart.
[06:23.390 --> 06:26.390]  You would have seen this the first 15 times
[06:26.390 --> 06:26.930]  that we did it.
[06:26.930 --> 06:28.250]  I didn't.
[06:28.250 --> 06:28.950]  Yeah, I agree.
[06:30.990 --> 06:32.210]  I can't jump.
[06:32.830 --> 06:33.810]  Jumpsy-upsies.
[06:35.630 --> 06:36.150]  Drop.
[06:36.790 --> 06:37.130]  Jump.
[06:37.990 --> 06:38.590]  Jump.
[06:40.590 --> 06:42.410]  We need to reset there.
[06:43.190 --> 06:43.810]  We got it.
[06:45.910 --> 06:47.030]  I can't jump.
[06:47.310 --> 06:48.030]  That was a big one.
[06:48.430 --> 06:50.470]  Are we all jumping every time apart from Gray?
[06:51.310 --> 06:53.310]  Yes, but at different times.
[06:54.390 --> 06:54.630]  See?
[06:54.630 --> 06:55.190]  Like that.
[06:56.890 --> 06:57.510]  Drop.
[07:02.480 --> 07:03.100]  Drop.
[07:03.760 --> 07:04.380]  Down.
[07:06.960 --> 07:07.860]  We got it.
[07:08.200 --> 07:10.690]  Oh, yeah.
[07:11.560 --> 07:12.420]  Look at that.
[07:12.540 --> 07:12.960]  Brilliant.
[07:14.020 --> 07:14.880]  Get in there.
[07:15.240 --> 07:16.540]  Get in the hole.
[07:17.440 --> 07:18.580]  We did it.
[07:19.260 --> 07:21.460]  Welcome to the beginning of the stream, guys.
[07:21.580 --> 07:23.440]  Everything before this didn't make it in.
[07:23.520 --> 07:24.660]  Way to go, guys.
[07:24.660 --> 07:26.680]  We're here. We're starting on level 2.
[07:26.940 --> 07:28.040]  Incredible stuff.
[07:29.460 --> 07:30.820]  Gavin doesn't drive
[07:30.820 --> 07:32.700]  and did everything he could to prevent him
[07:32.700 --> 07:34.080]  from being able to participate.
[07:34.240 --> 07:36.680]  We went live and my screen started flickering.
[07:37.080 --> 07:39.440]  Why did you jump on me?
[07:39.960 --> 07:40.660]  Oh, you pressed
[07:40.660 --> 07:41.420]  to Eric? Jesus.
[07:42.700 --> 07:44.100]  That's a death for Eric, clearly.
[07:44.820 --> 07:45.580]  What'd you do that for?
[07:47.780 --> 07:49.020]  Somebody gave us
[07:49.020 --> 07:50.140]  all the stats and everything
[07:50.140 --> 07:51.940]  and one of the notes that they made is,
[07:51.940 --> 07:53.820]  Gavin kills Eric a lot.
[07:56.420 --> 07:57.840]  Who's going to go in that little crev?
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.960]  Does one of us have to crev?
[08:00.340 --> 08:00.820]  Nope.
[08:01.860 --> 08:02.820]  Almost certainly.
[08:03.080 --> 08:05.580]  We have to go
[08:05.580 --> 08:07.920]  lower. One person goes down
[08:07.920 --> 08:08.940]  and the rest of us go up.
[08:09.620 --> 08:11.740]  Who died? Gavin, technically.
[08:13.540 --> 08:15.420]  Malignant Toaster again.
[08:15.840 --> 08:16.880]  Thanks, Malignant Toaster.
[08:16.940 --> 08:18.980]  Malignant Toaster died? Is that what you guys just said?
[08:18.980 --> 08:19.280]  No!
[08:20.280 --> 08:22.500]  Oh, okay. He pulled through.
[08:23.480 --> 08:25.520]  Gavin, are you going to walk in the little crevice then?
[08:26.420 --> 08:27.280]  Do you want me to?
[08:27.840 --> 08:29.140]  Go crev, go crev.
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.920]  Oh wait, he'll die there though.
[08:35.020 --> 08:36.060]  Shouldn't we all get off?
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.980]  I mean, I'd love to get off, but...
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.080]  Shouldn't we
[08:41.080 --> 08:42.640]  all get off, he says?
[08:42.920 --> 08:44.920]  Yeah, I think so. I'm thinking yeah.
[08:45.220 --> 08:46.640]  Why didn't anybody else get off?
[08:46.640 --> 08:47.760]  Because purple didn't move.
[08:48.640 --> 08:49.740]  Oh yeah, purple didn't move.
[08:49.940 --> 08:51.500]  Why are you doing?
[08:52.080 --> 08:54.400]  I got jumped on by the dipshit
[08:54.400 --> 08:56.360]  behind me! Which one?
[08:57.360 --> 08:57.880]  Purple!
[08:59.380 --> 09:00.660]  Guys, this is a real
[09:00.660 --> 09:02.560]  company. Let's just go all the way
[09:02.560 --> 09:04.240]  down and then we'll peg it.
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.700]  Do you think two of us can fit in there and jam
[09:06.700 --> 09:07.520]  the thing in place?
[09:09.020 --> 09:09.320]  Yeah!
[09:12.200 --> 09:12.720]  Okay.
[09:13.520 --> 09:13.940]  Okay.
[09:14.180 --> 09:15.880]  How do you want to play it, Eric? You gotta go.
[09:16.220 --> 09:18.380]  You're running on the screen. You're a
[09:18.380 --> 09:19.800]  fucking maniac.
[09:20.460 --> 09:22.500]  So I asked you, how do you want to play it, Eric?
[09:22.520 --> 09:24.840]  You said nothing, you shoot your
[09:24.840 --> 09:26.460]  pants, just like you always do.
[09:26.480 --> 09:28.220]  I was letting you take the lead!
[09:28.600 --> 09:29.740]  I did take the lead!
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.520]  Look it, he jumps on the button!
[09:32.800 --> 09:34.780]  They run two companies together
[09:34.780 --> 09:35.020]  and you can tell.
[09:36.220 --> 09:37.440]  What do you want to do, Eric?
[09:37.980 --> 09:39.540]  I want to stay in here.
[09:40.860 --> 09:42.360]  Is that what happens?
[09:42.380 --> 09:43.360]  Oh my god!
[09:43.740 --> 09:45.980]  Finally, somebody catches Eric's essence.
[09:46.540 --> 09:47.180]  That's funny.
[09:47.960 --> 09:50.100]  Finally, somebody's not scared to say it.
[09:50.860 --> 09:51.620]  Go right.
[09:51.880 --> 09:52.760]  And then everyone go, right?
[09:53.160 --> 09:53.920]  Gavin, go in.
[09:59.620 --> 10:00.560]  Go! Go!
[10:02.020 --> 10:02.540]  Okay.
[10:02.940 --> 10:04.920]  Purple on the bottom, red is second.
[10:05.120 --> 10:06.240]  I need to go second.
[10:07.000 --> 10:07.920]  Then green.
[10:08.700 --> 10:10.460]  Then blue, then orange.
[10:10.460 --> 10:11.200]  Where's blue?
[10:12.760 --> 10:13.960]  Orange, purple.
[10:14.180 --> 10:15.000]  Coming up!
[10:16.460 --> 10:16.880]  Red.
[10:17.540 --> 10:18.620]  Good, red.
[10:20.260 --> 10:22.320]  Way to go, guys!
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.020]  Yeah!
[10:26.200 --> 10:27.920]  One more time!
[10:28.200 --> 10:29.200]  Guys, I gotta move!
[10:29.280 --> 10:30.540]  Gavin, you gotta move!
[10:32.440 --> 10:34.460]  Alright, well I'm just gonna...
[10:35.860 --> 10:36.680]  Thank you, Gavin.
[10:37.100 --> 10:38.180]  Did your computer restart, Gavin?
[10:38.180 --> 10:39.700]  Gavin, are you okay?
[10:39.940 --> 10:40.740]  Gavin might be gone.
[10:40.760 --> 10:43.360]  Oh, my headphone's turned off.
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.180]  Oh, Jesus Christ!
[10:45.840 --> 10:47.080]  Andrew, you're right.
[10:47.380 --> 10:48.860]  It's just him.
[10:49.200 --> 10:51.640]  Dude, I don't understand.
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.120]  Run out of batteries.
[10:56.540 --> 10:57.400]  Oh, Gavin.
[10:58.420 --> 11:00.600]  And then Geoff didn't go.
[11:00.920 --> 11:02.580]  And then it was...
[11:02.580 --> 11:03.800]  Oh man, guys.
[11:04.320 --> 11:06.260]  Wave the idiot flag high, boys!
[11:06.260 --> 11:07.700]  Ha ha ha!
[11:07.720 --> 11:10.640]  Coming soon to a regulation store near you.
[11:11.240 --> 11:11.320]  God!
[11:12.140 --> 11:13.000]  Go, go!
[11:15.980 --> 11:16.700]  Gavin!
[11:17.360 --> 11:19.860]  Not even the hard part.
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.260]  What are you doing?
[11:32.060 --> 11:34.680]  Okay, I put the cover on my headphones.
[11:34.680 --> 11:35.780]  Ha ha ha!
[11:38.480 --> 11:40.080]  Who's gonna walk over right with me?
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.260]  Alright, thanks, Gavin. Appreciate it.
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.920]  Thank you so much.
[11:44.260 --> 11:44.900]  Yeah, dude, cool.
[11:45.160 --> 11:48.220]  We've done it correct once.
[11:48.620 --> 11:49.760]  We've done it correct once.
[11:49.980 --> 11:52.220]  You moron.
[11:52.740 --> 11:53.860]  Are you serious?
[11:56.140 --> 11:57.220]  Are you serious?
[11:57.940 --> 11:58.900]  Are you for real?
[11:59.320 --> 12:00.320]  Like, is this real?
[12:00.320 --> 12:02.200]  Do we not have a system?
[12:02.460 --> 12:03.220]  I feel insane.
[12:03.660 --> 12:06.420]  Maybe he didn't hear any of the initial bit.
[12:06.620 --> 12:07.520]  Nick, me and you. Ready?
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.280]  Right. Thank you. Okay.
[12:10.720 --> 12:11.760]  I'm purple.
[12:14.160 --> 12:14.520]  Gavin.
[12:15.480 --> 12:17.380]  What do you think we're doing?
[12:17.840 --> 12:19.820]  I was gonna get in, but then you said you and Nick.
[12:19.960 --> 12:20.620]  So I didn't move.
[12:21.580 --> 12:23.660]  So you stood in the fucking way?
[12:23.980 --> 12:24.120]  Yeah.
[12:27.000 --> 12:27.780]  Oh, Geoff.
[12:27.780 --> 12:29.780]  I can't. I'm sorry. I'm dying.
[12:30.560 --> 12:30.640]  Geoff!
[12:31.720 --> 12:33.980]  Like, this is the second level.
[12:34.620 --> 12:34.880]  Gavin!
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.860]  I gotta open a window.
[12:38.940 --> 12:39.820]  Oh, man.
[12:40.140 --> 12:45.160]  Oh, my God.
[12:45.320 --> 12:46.480]  Alright, Eric, me and you.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.160]  Why is it a two-person thing?
[12:48.180 --> 12:50.460]  Because we hold it from going back up.
[12:51.080 --> 12:52.920]  Yeah, but one person does that.
[12:54.100 --> 12:55.860]  Why is there two people doing it?
[12:57.780 --> 12:58.540]  Okay, I don't know why.
[12:59.160 --> 12:59.520]  Oh!
[13:06.600 --> 13:08.940]  I'm just gonna jam it myself.
[13:09.060 --> 13:10.460]  I'm just gonna speedrun this thing.
[13:11.960 --> 13:12.860]  Never mind, Geoff.
[13:13.180 --> 13:13.560]  Never mind.
[13:15.680 --> 13:17.340]  Actually, it probably works better
[13:17.340 --> 13:17.940]  with just one of us.
[13:17.960 --> 13:19.520]  Well, only one person is wedging it.
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.200]  You can't combine, can you?
[13:21.680 --> 13:23.640]  You're not becoming one when you're both down there.
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.960]  Gavin has all the answers.
[13:26.960 --> 13:29.340]  For a guy who doesn't have anything working,
[13:29.360 --> 13:30.400]  he's got all the solutions.
[13:30.440 --> 13:31.260]  Let Eric get over there, Gavin.
[13:33.180 --> 13:34.060]  I'll wedge it.
[13:34.660 --> 13:35.880]  Nice job.
[13:37.400 --> 13:38.040]  Thanks, Gav.
[13:38.580 --> 13:39.760]  That was good. Good job.
[13:40.300 --> 13:41.500]  Alright, let's see what we're dealing with here.
[13:42.220 --> 13:43.860]  We have red,
[13:45.180 --> 13:46.100]  green, purple,
[13:48.980 --> 13:49.440]  blue,
[13:51.220 --> 13:51.680]  orange,
[13:52.100 --> 13:52.880]  and then red.
[13:52.880 --> 13:54.100]  Yep, gotta go up.
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.520]  And then green. Hang on.
[13:56.640 --> 13:57.680]  There we go. Purple!
[13:58.320 --> 13:58.980]  Right behind you.
[13:59.240 --> 14:00.760]  Alright, we got it!
[14:01.080 --> 14:01.400]  Easy!
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.960]  Wow, Gavin really figured it out there for us.
[14:07.780 --> 14:08.560]  Thanks, Gav.
[14:09.060 --> 14:09.820]  Good job, Gav.
[14:10.040 --> 14:10.940]  You're a lifesaver.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.240]  You sure you don't need to restart 5 or 15 more times?
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.340]  Fail to load information for today.
[14:17.360 --> 14:18.760]  Oh my god!
[14:19.080 --> 14:21.220]  Why did you reformat your computer?
[14:21.220 --> 14:23.460]  Camera Cardinal 5 gifted, thank you.
[14:23.480 --> 14:25.360]  Please distract me. I appreciate it.
[14:25.500 --> 14:25.900]  Ah!
[14:26.700 --> 14:27.820]  Oh, okay. It's just a fan.
[14:28.020 --> 14:30.400]  Geoff didn't realize you were playing against the fan.
[14:30.980 --> 14:31.720]  Oh my god.
[14:39.010 --> 14:40.190]  Oh, we can jump on the fan.
[14:44.760 --> 14:45.160]  Alright.
[14:46.100 --> 14:46.760]  Come on up here.
[14:49.360 --> 14:51.240]  Oh boy, what are we doing here?
[14:51.720 --> 14:53.160]  Easy stuff, baby stuff.
[14:53.980 --> 14:55.080]  You want me to get it or go back?
[14:55.160 --> 14:55.420]  Purple.
[14:55.420 --> 14:55.760]  I'll get it.
[14:55.800 --> 14:56.020]  Purple.
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.540]  Oh, I guess so.
[15:01.040 --> 15:02.580]  Should we all get off?
[15:03.040 --> 15:04.980]  What if I...
[15:07.100 --> 15:10.040]  Wait, we should all just jump and move right.
[15:10.240 --> 15:11.220]  Just keep jumping right.
[15:11.840 --> 15:12.800]  There you go. That's it.
[15:13.240 --> 15:14.080]  Oh, okay.
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.520]  We don't need that, though?
[15:16.880 --> 15:17.680]  Hang on.
[15:18.260 --> 15:18.920]  Hit it.
[15:19.560 --> 15:19.740]  Whoa!
[15:19.740 --> 15:19.880]  Ah!
[15:20.940 --> 15:21.680]  Uh-oh.
[15:24.680 --> 15:25.680]  What do we do?
[15:25.720 --> 15:26.120]  What do we do?
[15:26.800 --> 15:28.240]  Okay, we don't die.
[15:28.500 --> 15:30.320]  Where did the key go, though?
[15:30.740 --> 15:32.660]  Where did the key go?
[15:32.880 --> 15:34.440]  What is this doing?
[15:35.620 --> 15:36.480]  Okay, I have the key.
[15:37.660 --> 15:40.120]  Is it making us fast or slippery or what?
[15:40.180 --> 15:40.520]  What's happening?
[15:40.720 --> 15:42.800]  It's making us way faster, I think.
[15:43.100 --> 15:43.400]  Ah!
[15:45.400 --> 15:47.860]  Just hold right. You know what it is at the beginning.
[15:47.860 --> 15:49.060]  I didn't remember that.
[15:49.540 --> 15:50.580]  We've only done it twice.
[15:52.740 --> 15:54.680]  So we don't need this again?
[15:55.280 --> 15:56.000]  I don't think so.
[15:56.100 --> 15:58.140]  It seems strange to just have it like this.
[15:58.240 --> 15:58.860]  Seems strange.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.620]  We can make that jump, though.
[16:01.300 --> 16:03.320]  Okay, everyone jump and move right.
[16:03.840 --> 16:05.900]  Yeah, that was weird to do it so early, but I like it.
[16:06.000 --> 16:06.360]  It's cool.
[16:07.040 --> 16:09.240]  I guess we'll just stand here?
[16:10.860 --> 16:11.580]  Well, watch out for the...
[16:13.220 --> 16:14.120]  Watch out for the what?
[16:14.660 --> 16:16.120]  Well, someone was not stood on the floor.
[16:17.100 --> 16:17.900]  Now what?
[16:18.320 --> 16:19.280]  Now we go all the way back?
[16:19.360 --> 16:20.340]  We need Geoff to join us.
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.540]  Now we can jump the big gaps.
[16:21.900 --> 16:24.000]  Yeah, we move the camera if we stay as a group.
[16:24.900 --> 16:26.620]  Oh, shit!
[16:27.120 --> 16:28.040]  I made it.
[16:29.720 --> 16:31.400]  There's some beans on these legs.
[16:31.500 --> 16:31.720]  Where did you...
[16:32.520 --> 16:33.720]  Oh, God.
[16:34.760 --> 16:35.580]  Gotta hold right.
[16:37.780 --> 16:38.980]  This feels too easy.
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.380]  Really? Because we died?
[16:42.180 --> 16:43.980]  No, we gotta grab the key and then we go all the way back.
[16:43.980 --> 16:45.640]  Oh, this is the same door.
[16:45.840 --> 16:46.660]  Oh, I see.
[16:48.340 --> 16:49.540]  Please don't go yet, Gavin.
[16:49.660 --> 16:50.320]  Please wait until we stop.
[16:51.360 --> 16:52.500]  Everyone go right. Right and jump.
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.960]  Okay, now if we stay on this middle part
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.200]  except for one person,
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.280]  is that the way to do it?
[16:59.380 --> 17:00.860]  Who's our best jumper? It's not me.
[17:00.980 --> 17:02.560]  I'll jump. I don't mind.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.360]  Okay, you guys ready?
[17:08.340 --> 17:09.060]  Everyone across.
[17:12.570 --> 17:13.450]  I'm not gonna move.
[17:13.450 --> 17:14.570]  Okay. Why?
[17:14.870 --> 17:16.190]  I don't kill you.
[17:16.450 --> 17:17.670]  Alright, whatever.
[17:18.490 --> 17:19.350]  It's okay.
[17:19.870 --> 17:22.250]  I'm not gonna move.
[17:22.490 --> 17:23.230]  Just kidding.
[17:23.610 --> 17:24.790]  But then you said nothing.
[17:31.710 --> 17:33.390]  You said you're not
[17:33.390 --> 17:33.870]  gonna move.
[17:34.390 --> 17:36.350]  And then you stood there.
[17:37.690 --> 17:38.690]  You said
[17:38.690 --> 17:40.450]  I'm not going to move.
[17:40.450 --> 17:42.150]  As soon as I went,
[17:42.530 --> 17:44.330]  you moved. I don't know how that's
[17:44.330 --> 17:46.150]  my fault. It doesn't matter.
[17:46.370 --> 17:48.310]  I didn't die. I'm just pointing out
[17:48.310 --> 17:50.490]  you said I'm not going to
[17:50.490 --> 17:51.650]  move. I did say that.
[17:51.890 --> 17:54.230]  And then you said nothing in response to it.
[17:54.230 --> 17:54.850]  You stood there.
[17:56.130 --> 17:57.910]  You stood there waiting.
[17:58.310 --> 18:00.070]  And then I thought, well, you know what?
[18:00.110 --> 18:01.950]  I guess he's waiting on me. That's my bad.
[18:02.090 --> 18:04.550]  Oh my god. I'm not gonna move.
[18:04.670 --> 18:05.630]  Alright, time to go.
[18:06.930 --> 18:07.710]  Say something.
[18:07.710 --> 18:10.650]  If you see something, say something.
[18:10.670 --> 18:11.650]  Oh, spikes! Spikes!
[18:11.830 --> 18:12.230]  SPIKES!
[18:13.750 --> 18:14.970]  Yep, I made it.
[18:16.850 --> 18:17.630]  Spikes there, guys.
[18:18.130 --> 18:18.310]  Yep.
[18:19.650 --> 18:21.970]  Hey, Gavin. You just wanna hold right.
[18:22.190 --> 18:22.590]  Right at the beginning.
[18:25.050 --> 18:25.690]  Oh, shit.
[18:29.950 --> 18:34.090]  Okay, we got this. Everybody line up.
[18:34.850 --> 18:35.570]  Go to the end.
[18:35.570 --> 18:37.230]  Do I have to float this thing across?
[18:37.470 --> 18:39.770]  Remember the spikes that are down there?
[18:40.030 --> 18:41.310]  I guess it's easier than jumping.
[18:41.490 --> 18:42.250]  Right there.
[18:43.390 --> 18:43.830]  Okay.
[18:45.010 --> 18:46.330]  Gavin decided to go.
[18:46.710 --> 18:47.590]  Well, I mean, we're there, aren't we?
[18:49.050 --> 18:49.650]  Are we?
[18:51.490 --> 18:53.250]  Oh, that was so efficient.
[18:58.980 --> 18:59.420]  FUCK!
[19:02.820 --> 19:03.640]  That's okay, though.
[19:03.660 --> 19:04.980]  We got this figured out.
[19:08.860 --> 19:10.340]  Geoff started holding left.
[19:14.120 --> 19:15.340]  He's pushing Gavin back.
[19:16.700 --> 19:18.760]  I'm such a big fan of someone in the chat saying
[19:18.760 --> 19:19.660]  it's never Geoff.
[19:19.940 --> 19:23.020]  I think that's so fucking great.
[19:23.720 --> 19:24.660]  Alright, and here we go.
[19:26.940 --> 19:27.800]  You wanna hit it again, Gav?
[19:28.160 --> 19:28.480]  We're there!
[19:32.240 --> 19:32.720]  You...
[19:32.720 --> 19:33.080]  Alright.
[19:39.170 --> 19:40.270]  God damn it.
[19:40.270 --> 19:42.050]  I should've just waited half a second.
[19:42.190 --> 19:43.250]  It would've been Geoff instead of me.
[19:45.750 --> 19:47.670]  I don't know why I was in such a hurry.
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.780]  Tweet! Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!
[19:55.540 --> 19:56.740]  Yeah, you tell him, Gavin.
[20:06.520 --> 20:06.920]  And...
[20:06.920 --> 20:07.640]  stop. Okay.
[20:08.320 --> 20:08.660]  Hey, Gavin.
[20:18.290 --> 20:19.590]  Alright, everybody just calm down.
[20:21.670 --> 20:22.070]  Okay.
[20:22.730 --> 20:23.330]  I'm calm.
[20:24.510 --> 20:25.230]  Oh, Geoff!
[20:28.070 --> 20:29.090]  Ah, it's too close.
[20:30.130 --> 20:30.850]  You motherfucker.
[20:31.750 --> 20:33.530]  You think I'm ever gonna be able to do that again?
[20:34.110 --> 20:34.730]  Sorry about that.
[20:36.850 --> 20:38.310]  I'll go last in that situation.
[20:39.510 --> 20:40.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:40.070 --> 20:40.970]  Get a little bit of an on-ramp.
[20:48.700 --> 20:49.840]  A little dance.
[20:50.020 --> 20:50.800]  A little dance up here.
[20:55.860 --> 20:56.240]  Oh!
[20:58.020 --> 20:59.700]  Alright, I guess I'll push the button this time.
[21:00.800 --> 21:01.800]  Need a little bit more.
[21:02.340 --> 21:02.920]  There you go.
[21:03.760 --> 21:05.440]  Shit. Jeez.
[21:06.620 --> 21:07.960]  Geoff wants to be at the front.
[21:08.100 --> 21:08.880]  Oh, he's leading!
[21:10.880 --> 21:12.200]  Came halfway back!
[21:15.220 --> 21:17.600]  Do you need some, like, thumb cream or something?
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.200]  Do you have any thumb cream?
[21:22.560 --> 21:23.400]  I'll take it.
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400]  Some gamer cream?
[21:24.920 --> 21:25.600]  We got you.
[21:25.880 --> 21:27.440]  Aw, can we sell gamer cream?
[21:29.900 --> 21:31.320]  Regulation gamer cream.
[21:32.340 --> 21:33.660]  Let's just stick him.
[21:43.090 --> 21:44.300]  Alright, everybody calm down.
[21:44.740 --> 21:45.000]  Okay.
[21:48.060 --> 21:49.800]  Nick, calm down.
[21:50.240 --> 21:51.180]  I'm calm, man.
[21:52.220 --> 21:53.840]  Gavin didn't hold right.
[21:54.060 --> 21:55.960]  Gavin didn't hold right.
[21:56.840 --> 21:59.340]  I wanna go home,
[21:59.440 --> 22:00.340]  but I'm already home.
[22:01.180 --> 22:02.040]  You're home, buddy.
[22:02.300 --> 22:03.980]  I can't be more home.
[22:04.120 --> 22:05.440]  Geoff, can you do the thing?
[22:07.820 --> 22:08.680]  Try again.
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.360]  Hit the button.
[22:16.640 --> 22:17.300]  Holy shit.
[22:17.340 --> 22:18.580]  Alright, everybody back off.
[22:18.580 --> 22:19.800]  You said that last time.
[22:20.360 --> 22:21.040]  Not that far.
[22:22.780 --> 22:23.300]  Yes!
[22:25.520 --> 22:26.040]  Wow!
[22:26.100 --> 22:27.200]  What are you doing?
[22:27.580 --> 22:30.600]  That is terrible. What a bad feeling.
[22:31.700 --> 22:33.120]  Having that happen just once
[22:33.120 --> 22:33.940]  is a terrible feeling.
[22:34.160 --> 22:36.580]  I can't imagine it two dozen times.
[22:37.100 --> 22:38.500]  Well, it hasn't been two dozen times yet,
[22:38.500 --> 22:39.160]  but it could be.
[22:42.860 --> 22:44.240]  Like three times,
[22:44.340 --> 22:45.400]  but it could definitely be more.
[22:46.080 --> 22:46.620]  Ow!
[22:55.970 --> 22:57.870]  You almost killed me, Eric.
[22:58.310 --> 23:00.130]  You're alive. I don't know what the problem is.
[23:03.130 --> 23:04.210]  Hang on.
[23:04.710 --> 23:06.030]  I'm in a situation here
[23:06.030 --> 23:07.950]  because if I go a little bit forward, I'm going to fall.
[23:08.390 --> 23:09.510]  There we go.
[23:14.850 --> 23:15.390]  Didn't...
[23:15.390 --> 23:16.330]  I just tapped it.
[23:16.910 --> 23:18.930]  This is legitimately
[23:20.010 --> 23:21.570]  the funniest game ever made.
[23:21.570 --> 23:23.010]  Is this going to be...
[23:23.010 --> 23:25.850]  This is the funniest game. This is going to be an hour-long stream
[23:25.850 --> 23:27.270]  and we're going to complete four levels.
[23:27.550 --> 23:29.530]  This is the funniest stream we've ever done.
[23:29.850 --> 23:31.090]  We're like three levels in.
[23:31.390 --> 23:32.110]  This is incredible.
[23:33.450 --> 23:36.130]  This one might be my bad.
[23:36.350 --> 23:37.030]  Oh my God!
[23:39.150 --> 23:40.710]  I'm with Gavin.
[23:41.850 --> 23:43.450]  I mean, I get it, but also...
[23:43.450 --> 23:44.810]  That's fine. It doesn't matter.
[23:53.700 --> 23:54.680]  Oh, Nick.
[23:55.320 --> 23:56.480]  Who wants to go next?
[23:56.720 --> 23:57.620]  I got it, Gavin.
[23:57.960 --> 24:04.820]  That wasn't what I thought
[24:04.820 --> 24:05.480]  was going to happen.
[24:06.240 --> 24:08.260]  That was honestly pretty exciting.
[24:08.880 --> 24:10.140]  That was honestly pretty exciting.
[24:10.580 --> 24:11.560]  I jump-scared myself.
[24:13.720 --> 24:14.400]  I said,
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.920]  who wants to go next, and then just rested my forehead
[24:16.920 --> 24:17.680]  on the microphone.
[24:23.700 --> 24:24.460]  Gavin!
[24:24.740 --> 24:25.320]  Gavin!
[24:26.440 --> 24:26.980]  Gavin!
[24:28.520 --> 24:29.860]  Let me get this window.
[24:31.700 --> 24:33.040]  You gotta open another window.
[24:35.400 --> 24:37.060]  Buy and install an extra window.
[24:38.560 --> 24:39.740]  Smee's rolling around.
[24:43.940 --> 24:45.460]  Oh, man.
[24:45.460 --> 24:46.080]  Okay.
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.520]  Calm down, big fella.
[24:51.880 --> 24:55.940]  Okay, good job so far.
[25:01.880 --> 25:02.640]  Nice, Geoff.
[25:03.420 --> 25:03.740]  Yeah.
[25:09.460 --> 25:09.800]  Andrew?
[25:10.280 --> 25:11.880]  Yeah, I was just making sure.
[25:14.900 --> 25:16.100]  Okay, Geoff, do you want to go first?
[25:16.200 --> 25:16.440]  Yeah.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.500]  Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[25:19.500 --> 25:20.500]  Hang on.
[25:20.920 --> 25:22.120]  There we go.
[25:23.520 --> 25:24.120]  Cool.
[25:26.700 --> 25:28.120]  There we go!
[25:29.160 --> 25:30.820]  Watch out for the edge!
[25:33.180 --> 25:34.100]  Where's the key?
[25:34.720 --> 25:36.040]  Let them go.
[25:36.560 --> 25:36.720]  No!
[25:38.140 --> 25:40.160]  I beat it!
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.220]  I did it!
[25:42.780 --> 25:44.720]  It shouldn't make me do it again!
[25:45.340 --> 25:46.440]  I did it!
[25:46.440 --> 25:47.880]  It shouldn't make me do it again!
[25:48.460 --> 25:49.340]  Who died?
[25:49.740 --> 25:50.620]  I died.
[25:50.860 --> 25:53.440]  I did it!
[25:53.820 --> 25:54.640]  Eric wins!
[25:56.220 --> 25:57.340]  That was close.
[25:57.940 --> 25:58.800]  That was really close.
[25:59.160 --> 25:59.780]  We got this.
[26:00.820 --> 26:04.500]  I wonder if there's a way to turn the fan off.
[26:04.620 --> 26:05.060]  Probably not.
[26:06.040 --> 26:06.700]  That'd be great.
[26:08.180 --> 26:08.480]  Gavin?
[26:09.420 --> 26:11.120]  That was nobody's fault.
[26:11.500 --> 26:12.260]  That was no one's fault.
[26:12.260 --> 26:15.420]  Geoff and I both jumped, and I prevented him from going forward.
[26:15.720 --> 26:18.660]  No, but we were both in the air.
[26:19.980 --> 26:23.000]  I was ahead of Geoff, and we both just went for it.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.220]  Did you say it's nobody's fault, but I stopped Geoff from doing it.
[26:25.760 --> 26:28.920]  Yeah, but I don't think anyone was in the wrong on that move.
[26:29.860 --> 26:30.340]  I agree.
[26:30.420 --> 26:31.540]  Did you die? Did he die?
[26:31.760 --> 26:32.240]  I died.
[26:33.060 --> 26:36.160]  It'll be my death on the fucking spreadsheet, that's for sure.
[26:37.740 --> 26:38.520]  I didn't make it.
[26:39.100 --> 26:40.440]  Any thoughts about that, Eric?
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.040]  Yeah, you went a little soon.
[26:42.640 --> 26:44.560]  Well, I don't think so.
[26:44.760 --> 26:47.780]  You were just stood on it for two or three seconds after we got off.
[26:48.020 --> 26:51.100]  I was opening a window.
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.900]  How much pee you got in your office?
[26:55.120 --> 26:56.520]  Yeah, it's a cat piss room again.
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.480]  On a safari for some dickheads, and I found them.
[27:03.840 --> 27:04.640]  We're regressing!
[27:05.020 --> 27:05.700]  We're regressing!
[27:06.480 --> 27:08.300]  I beat the level. I went in the door.
[27:08.300 --> 27:09.900]  I don't know what's wrong with the rest of you.
[27:10.360 --> 27:10.820]  Congratulations.
[27:11.360 --> 27:13.180]  Oh my...
[27:13.180 --> 27:13.760]  Oh god.
[27:16.320 --> 27:17.440]  Get over here.
[27:17.760 --> 27:18.940]  It's quite a pickle, isn't it?
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.140]  Yeah, I don't know why we've decided to fuck around on the lift all of a sudden.
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.660]  Who's fucking around?
[27:28.000 --> 27:28.900]  Geoff went early.
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.140]  Because you didn't open a fucking door.
[27:33.220 --> 27:34.560]  I did open the door.
[27:35.160 --> 27:36.180]  Yeah, then you died!
[27:36.180 --> 27:36.780]  Yeah.
[27:37.860 --> 27:39.040]  With both ways.
[27:39.260 --> 27:39.720]  It's a sacrifice.
[27:40.980 --> 27:42.640]  Then Gavin died for some reason.
[27:42.940 --> 27:43.780]  Well, he was already dead.
[27:44.620 --> 27:45.520]  So you died too?
[27:51.630 --> 27:52.150]  Alright.
[27:52.810 --> 27:53.810]  Here comes this part again.
[27:54.050 --> 27:55.530]  Back to where we've been before.
[27:59.320 --> 27:59.840]  Whoa.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.840]  Spikes over there.
[28:02.380 --> 28:02.600]  Yep.
[28:04.040 --> 28:05.180]  There's spikes over there.
[28:05.180 --> 28:07.660]  Oh my god.
[28:07.980 --> 28:11.620]  When we only get through three levels today in an hour,
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.160]  like you were surmising earlier,
[28:13.280 --> 28:15.600]  I want it to be noticed it's not only because of me.
[28:15.820 --> 28:16.800]  No, it's definitely not.
[28:16.960 --> 28:18.180]  No, it's definitely because of Gavin too.
[28:18.700 --> 28:19.060]  Yeah.
[28:21.080 --> 28:23.400]  What the fuck are you doing?
[28:23.660 --> 28:24.360]  What was that?
[28:24.700 --> 28:26.440]  I just got shoved off.
[28:26.560 --> 28:29.340]  My controller is like on the desk.
[28:29.480 --> 28:30.780]  I don't have hands on it.
[28:30.840 --> 28:32.200]  And I got shoved off.
[28:32.200 --> 28:33.060]  That's crazy.
[28:34.280 --> 28:35.900]  That was a coordinated kill.
[28:36.180 --> 28:37.360]  Now I want to say,
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.940]  the reason we aren't beating these levels
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.780]  is because of Geoff.
[28:41.980 --> 28:43.560]  But you can't shove in this game.
[28:43.620 --> 28:44.440]  How did you get shoved?
[28:44.740 --> 28:48.480]  He jumped on what Andrew slipped off slid me.
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.300]  And I got pushed.
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.360]  What did you just say?
[28:51.440 --> 28:53.620]  I described exactly what happened.
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.220]  He got pushed because of a slide slop situation.
[28:57.520 --> 28:58.260]  Slide slop!
[29:01.300 --> 29:02.400]  Yeah, I guess...
[29:02.400 --> 29:03.800]  Oh, alright.
[29:05.180 --> 29:05.680]  Wow.
[29:07.580 --> 29:08.160]  Spikes.
[29:10.220 --> 29:11.920]  Oh my god.
[29:12.400 --> 29:13.720]  I'm almost there, hang on.
[29:14.860 --> 29:15.980]  That one's on me.
[29:16.280 --> 29:18.840]  I absolutely accept responsibility for my first kill.
[29:18.920 --> 29:19.320]  Thanks, Nick.
[29:19.940 --> 29:20.240]  You're welcome.
[29:24.810 --> 29:26.730]  You just do it on purpose.
[29:27.050 --> 29:28.710]  Geoff, it didn't work
[29:28.710 --> 29:30.930]  And then he kept going further to make sure it did.
[29:31.050 --> 29:32.430]  You just suck.
[29:32.770 --> 29:34.070]  Go home.
[29:34.910 --> 29:37.030]  I can't, I already did.
[29:43.380 --> 29:44.680]  Good old button push.
[29:46.140 --> 29:46.940]  Okay.
[29:51.350 --> 29:52.150]  Nice.
[29:55.300 --> 29:56.540]  Who's going next?
[29:56.820 --> 29:58.820]  Me? Okay.
[29:59.380 --> 29:59.700]  Really?
[30:01.540 --> 30:02.060]  Whoa!
[30:03.120 --> 30:03.440]  What?
[30:05.160 --> 30:07.280]  Andrew went a little bit flippy on my screen.
[30:08.280 --> 30:08.880]  Geoff.
[30:12.020 --> 30:12.620]  Nice.
[30:13.240 --> 30:13.540]  Beautiful.
[30:14.420 --> 30:15.600]  Who's got the key?
[30:17.140 --> 30:18.700]  I had the key.
[30:19.060 --> 30:20.040]  Geoff's got the key.
[30:21.460 --> 30:22.060]  Geoff!
[30:23.640 --> 30:24.860]  I'll take the key.
[30:25.100 --> 30:26.580]  He took the key back.
[30:28.100 --> 30:28.700]  Geoff.
[30:28.980 --> 30:30.200]  Geoff on the platform.
[30:30.200 --> 30:32.340]  Geoff, call him all the way down.
[30:32.440 --> 30:33.700]  Oh my god, Geoff.
[30:34.480 --> 30:35.280]  Jesus Christ.
[30:35.820 --> 30:38.620]  Guys, when we have to do this level again,
[30:38.760 --> 30:39.380]  it's Geoff.
[30:39.760 --> 30:41.860]  No, I'm not going to screw it up.
[30:41.880 --> 30:42.680]  That's why I don't want the key.
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.880]  Andrew, you already had a chance at this.
[30:45.420 --> 30:46.220]  Let's go as a group.
[30:48.160 --> 30:49.120]  Alright, we'll watch.
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.220]  Roughly stuff.
[30:56.140 --> 30:56.780]  What's the button?
[30:56.780 --> 30:57.340]  Everybody in?
[30:58.680 --> 30:59.200]  Clear!
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.820]  We are only half an hour away
[31:03.820 --> 31:05.240]  from 501.
[31:06.040 --> 31:07.080]  Holy shit.
[31:07.460 --> 31:08.060]  We got this.
[31:08.480 --> 31:10.160]  We might have to do an extra bonus round.
[31:11.680 --> 31:13.100]  What the hell is...
[31:13.100 --> 31:14.800]  Oh, I don't know.
[31:14.940 --> 31:16.160]  I'm not even sure what that was.
[31:16.220 --> 31:17.180]  I don't know.
[31:17.580 --> 31:18.720]  Just get ready to run.
[31:19.340 --> 31:21.560]  We got hit plus and then we got jump good.
[31:22.760 --> 31:24.040]  Alright, well.
[31:24.040 --> 31:25.100]  Jumped bad.
[31:30.320 --> 31:31.040]  Jump good!
[31:32.340 --> 31:33.060]  Jump good!
[31:34.940 --> 31:36.040]  Not like I jumped good.
[31:36.320 --> 31:36.740]  I made it.
[31:37.440 --> 31:39.700]  I think we know who's in first place here.
[31:39.980 --> 31:41.360]  Just only look at you.
[31:42.220 --> 31:42.500]  Yep.
[31:43.820 --> 31:44.860]  Who were you looking at?
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.560]  I was looking at Gavin.
[31:47.380 --> 31:48.160]  I didn't die.
[31:48.820 --> 31:50.020]  I know, that's why I was looking at you.
[31:51.780 --> 31:52.620]  That was me.
[31:56.500 --> 31:57.540]  That one's on me.
[32:05.210 --> 32:06.690]  That was too close to tell.
[32:06.810 --> 32:07.270]  It was hard to see.
[32:11.910 --> 32:13.650]  Dude, how did I miss that?
[32:14.090 --> 32:15.110]  It just happens.
[32:15.210 --> 32:16.290]  It just happens sometimes.
[32:16.590 --> 32:18.270]  God damn, what have I missed?
[32:18.710 --> 32:19.150]  Netcode.
[32:23.390 --> 32:24.170]  Look at this.
[32:24.190 --> 32:25.550]  I just fucking panicked there.
[32:29.230 --> 32:30.750]  One at a time, it's fine.
[32:31.390 --> 32:33.370]  We got it, we got it, we got it.
[32:33.430 --> 32:35.310]  We got it.
[32:36.910 --> 32:38.990]  Geoff, you did it, that was awesome.
[32:39.070 --> 32:40.030]  I totally did it.
[32:41.530 --> 32:42.910]  Why am I always right in the smoosh?
[32:42.970 --> 32:45.610]  I don't know, I don't like being at the back of this.
[32:50.590 --> 32:51.630]  Every obstacle.
[32:52.890 --> 32:54.790]  Everybody's looking real good right there.
[32:55.070 --> 32:56.730]  Remember to jump good.
[33:04.320 --> 33:05.360]  Oh shit.
[33:10.340 --> 33:13.600]  There's some positional shifting that really complicated that last part.
[33:13.680 --> 33:15.620]  Sorry, I don't think there's a way...
[33:15.620 --> 33:16.380]  We'll see, we'll see.
[33:19.340 --> 33:20.780]  Thank you, Earl.
[33:21.280 --> 33:22.420]  Appreciate you.
[33:22.560 --> 33:23.840]  Thank you so much, Earl.
[33:37.820 --> 33:38.980]  I got it.
[33:40.040 --> 33:40.980]  Watch out for the end.
[33:41.740 --> 33:42.920]  We did it.
[33:42.980 --> 33:43.960]  Good job.
[33:45.540 --> 33:46.980]  Nice job, fellas.
[33:47.420 --> 33:49.840]  Thank you, Earl, for the five gifted.
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.120]  I was watching...
[33:51.660 --> 33:53.840]  I was watching Jason Lee's blind part
[33:54.700 --> 33:56.080]  in that blind video
[33:56.080 --> 33:57.120]  from forever ago the other day.
[33:57.560 --> 33:57.740]  1991?
[33:59.040 --> 34:01.620]  Why are we here?
[34:02.380 --> 34:02.600]  Gavin.
[34:03.560 --> 34:04.480]  Chill your beans.
[34:05.040 --> 34:06.380]  Let's get those beans nice and chilled.
[34:06.540 --> 34:07.400]  Special park.
[34:09.680 --> 34:11.680]  Is this going to be anything like action park?
[34:12.160 --> 34:13.320]  Crap lord, you didn't miss anything.
[34:13.460 --> 34:14.560]  You missed us doing real well.
[34:15.420 --> 34:16.620]  Is this what my mom was talking about?
[34:16.620 --> 34:17.960]  What do we...
[34:19.200 --> 34:20.340]  What do I do?
[34:20.480 --> 34:21.280]  Do I have to press a button?
[34:21.380 --> 34:22.320]  Just hit a button.
[34:24.420 --> 34:25.300]  It's my turn.
[34:25.420 --> 34:26.620]  There's one death button?
[34:27.200 --> 34:27.920]  I guess so.
[34:38.690 --> 34:39.510]  That's a bad one.
[34:40.530 --> 34:41.730]  I'm going to go down here.
[34:44.490 --> 34:45.150]  Just one more.
[34:45.150 --> 34:45.910]  All the marbles.
[34:46.110 --> 34:46.910]  Just one more.
[34:48.970 --> 34:50.810]  Oh, the suspense.
[34:53.810 --> 34:54.890]  He did it!
[34:55.290 --> 34:56.730]  Don't touch the other buttons.
[34:57.110 --> 34:58.590]  I beat the level. You can do whatever you want.
[34:59.590 --> 35:00.950]  What was that about, that level?
[35:01.850 --> 35:03.750]  I think we just avoided all the deaths.
[35:05.070 --> 35:06.150]  That was the easiest level in the game.
[35:06.430 --> 35:08.950]  After the last four levels, that is a godsend.
[35:09.070 --> 35:09.410]  Thank you.
[35:11.950 --> 35:13.650]  Nice one. Blind luck shows up.
[35:13.650 --> 35:14.990]  I'll take it.
[35:17.150 --> 35:19.650]  Better to be lucky than good.
[35:22.810 --> 35:24.590]  I don't understand.
[35:25.470 --> 35:26.970]  We're trying to make that thing on the left.
[35:27.810 --> 35:29.110]  It's like a Mario Party thing.
[35:29.770 --> 35:30.730]  So blue and gray go.
[35:31.410 --> 35:32.230]  Do what though?
[35:33.410 --> 35:37.210]  When you jump, it makes stuff...
[35:37.210 --> 35:37.790]  happen.
[35:39.490 --> 35:41.550]  When I jump, blue goes up.
[35:42.350 --> 35:44.350]  When I jump, orange goes up.
[35:44.630 --> 35:44.650]  Oh!
[35:46.270 --> 35:47.730]  No, because I'm jumping
[35:47.730 --> 35:49.590]  and gray isn't going up.
[35:49.910 --> 35:50.950]  What the fuck is this?
[35:51.750 --> 35:52.270]  Who's gray?
[35:52.870 --> 35:53.870]  Stop jumping.
[35:55.090 --> 35:57.710]  When I jump, blue goes up one.
[35:58.610 --> 35:58.890]  Okay.
[35:59.390 --> 36:00.230]  I do orange.
[36:01.950 --> 36:03.390]  Orange doesn't need to go.
[36:03.770 --> 36:05.110]  I'm holding a blue one.
[36:05.390 --> 36:06.570]  Who has gray?
[36:08.150 --> 36:09.990]  Maybe orange and blue make gray?
[36:09.990 --> 36:10.850]  Just hold one.
[36:11.850 --> 36:12.830]  Hold one what?
[36:13.810 --> 36:15.770]  Hold and we make a blue, right?
[36:16.270 --> 36:17.850]  So four people hold blue.
[36:18.890 --> 36:19.890]  I'm holding blue.
[36:20.110 --> 36:21.350]  Okay, so who's not holding?
[36:21.650 --> 36:23.310]  I'm not holding, so what do I do?
[36:24.390 --> 36:25.290]  Oh, I see.
[36:25.390 --> 36:27.050]  You just walk left.
[36:27.810 --> 36:29.450]  We need...
[36:31.710 --> 36:33.670]  Everybody has to walk left
[36:33.670 --> 36:35.590]  and four need to hold A.
[36:35.750 --> 36:36.110]  Okay.
[36:36.110 --> 36:38.210]  Okay, got it, got it, got it.
[36:41.500 --> 36:43.020]  Okay, four left.
[36:43.340 --> 36:44.000]  I'm going left.
[36:46.020 --> 36:47.200]  I'm one right.
[36:48.400 --> 36:49.860]  And then we need...
[36:49.860 --> 36:50.540]  One more left.
[36:51.490 --> 36:52.820]  Hey, we did it.
[36:52.860 --> 36:54.640]  I held up and left.
[36:55.660 --> 36:57.580]  Now we need...
[36:57.580 --> 36:58.140]  That's it.
[36:59.100 --> 37:00.280]  I'm holding right.
[37:01.760 --> 37:03.220]  Then one jumping.
[37:03.680 --> 37:05.440]  We need one more right.
[37:06.640 --> 37:07.780]  One more right.
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.560]  Gavin right.
[37:12.020 --> 37:12.960]  Gavin's not.
[37:14.060 --> 37:15.440]  Maybe I'm too...
[37:16.460 --> 37:17.340]  Who's jumping?
[37:17.500 --> 37:18.880]  We don't need to have jumping.
[37:21.320 --> 37:22.100]  One left.
[37:22.780 --> 37:23.480]  One person left.
[37:23.980 --> 37:24.800]  Geoff left.
[37:25.420 --> 37:25.800]  There you go.
[37:27.420 --> 37:28.720]  I'm going left.
[37:28.800 --> 37:29.800]  We need two people jumping.
[37:31.060 --> 37:31.960]  Too many.
[37:31.960 --> 37:32.040]  Too many.
[37:34.960 --> 37:35.940]  Nick, Gavin, jump.
[37:36.020 --> 37:36.420]  That's it.
[37:36.860 --> 37:38.540]  We need someone to add a little bit of left.
[37:39.340 --> 37:39.820]  What?
[37:40.580 --> 37:40.860]  Don't we?
[37:42.920 --> 37:44.440]  Nick, Gavin, jump.
[37:44.620 --> 37:45.360]  Nick, go left.
[37:46.940 --> 37:48.160]  Someone needs to do a jump.
[37:48.780 --> 37:49.660]  I'm going left.
[37:51.660 --> 37:52.880]  Everyone hold left.
[37:53.120 --> 37:53.380]  I'll jump.
[37:55.180 --> 37:56.760]  No, we got it.
[37:56.800 --> 37:57.760]  We had it.
[37:57.760 --> 37:59.460]  We were so close.
[37:59.960 --> 38:01.100]  This sucks.
[38:01.920 --> 38:03.860]  Everyone hold right. Everyone jump.
[38:04.680 --> 38:05.800]  Oh, no, it's left.
[38:06.040 --> 38:07.560]  Everyone hold left. Everyone jump.
[38:09.940 --> 38:10.120]  Okay.
[38:13.500 --> 38:14.600]  I did nothing.
[38:14.940 --> 38:17.120]  I'm going left.
[38:17.360 --> 38:17.620]  One left.
[38:19.360 --> 38:20.740]  Someone go left.
[38:20.900 --> 38:21.800]  Hey, Geoff.
[38:22.760 --> 38:23.360]  I was left.
[38:23.820 --> 38:25.020]  You gotta walk, though.
[38:25.020 --> 38:25.560]  I'm jumping.
[38:26.820 --> 38:27.620]  I'll go left.
[38:28.960 --> 38:30.000]  Geoff, hold jump.
[38:30.920 --> 38:32.200]  I'm holding right and I'm jumping.
[38:32.540 --> 38:34.440]  I'm doing a right and a jump. I'm adding two.
[38:35.540 --> 38:36.560]  Geoff, hold right.
[38:37.820 --> 38:39.160]  So that's what's going on.
[38:39.560 --> 38:40.700]  Geoff, hold left.
[38:41.780 --> 38:42.620]  I'll do a jump.
[38:43.120 --> 38:43.760]  I'll go right.
[38:45.500 --> 38:46.300]  I'll go left.
[38:48.080 --> 38:49.100]  Okay, there's that.
[38:49.540 --> 38:50.320]  I'll go right.
[38:50.320 --> 38:51.800]  Okay, I'm going left.
[38:52.060 --> 38:53.280]  Okay, we got it.
[38:53.960 --> 38:55.260]  I'm going left.
[38:56.090 --> 38:56.880]  There, that's it.
[38:57.340 --> 38:58.160]  Everyone go left.
[39:00.070 --> 39:00.760]  Geoff, jump.
[39:02.380 --> 39:03.300]  I'm going left.
[39:03.700 --> 39:04.460]  I'm going right.
[39:05.400 --> 39:07.280]  Okay, I'm going jump.
[39:08.000 --> 39:08.740]  One more left.
[39:10.560 --> 39:11.820]  I'm on the left only.
[39:14.160 --> 39:14.520]  Go!
[39:14.980 --> 39:16.140]  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[39:16.440 --> 39:16.680]  No!
[39:18.800 --> 39:19.520]  Good lord.
[39:19.620 --> 39:22.040]  Geoff, you don't just press the direction. You have to hold it.
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.240]  I know. I was doing it.
[39:24.760 --> 39:26.080]  Alright, I'm doing a...
[39:26.080 --> 39:27.160]  I'm doing a jump and a right.
[39:27.460 --> 39:28.540]  Okay, there we go.
[39:30.780 --> 39:31.940]  We need one less person.
[39:31.960 --> 39:32.820]  Only one person jump.
[39:33.500 --> 39:34.100]  What are we missing?
[39:38.200 --> 39:38.760]  There we go.
[39:41.440 --> 39:41.800]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[39:41.800 --> 39:42.360]  Oh, we had that.
[39:43.920 --> 39:45.080]  Nobody go left.
[39:45.340 --> 39:46.020]  Nobody go left.
[39:47.820 --> 39:48.640]  There we go.
[39:52.520 --> 39:52.960]  Right.
[39:53.740 --> 39:54.620]  Nobody go right.
[39:55.000 --> 39:55.500]  Nobody go right.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.340]  I'm having a stroke.
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.000]  I'm going right.
[40:02.220 --> 40:02.960]  I'm just going right.
[40:03.220 --> 40:04.760]  There we go.
[40:04.960 --> 40:05.840]  Sorry, that was on me.
[40:06.860 --> 40:08.080]  I'm doing a right and a jump.
[40:08.540 --> 40:09.660]  I'm going left.
[40:09.660 --> 40:09.840]  There we go.
[40:10.460 --> 40:12.060]  One more left.
[40:12.640 --> 40:16.240]  There we go.
[40:16.760 --> 40:17.540]  I'm jumping.
[40:18.720 --> 40:19.820]  I'm going left.
[40:21.140 --> 40:23.400]  Everyone go left.
[40:23.560 --> 40:23.960]  Everyone jump.
[40:25.360 --> 40:25.820]  Two left.
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.060]  One left.
[40:29.700 --> 40:30.380]  Jump.
[40:31.940 --> 40:32.840]  Three up.
[40:33.500 --> 40:34.560]  Get in the door!
[40:35.760 --> 40:36.660]  Get in!
[40:36.660 --> 40:37.620]  Get in there!
[40:38.760 --> 40:40.540]  Oh, thank God.
[40:41.100 --> 40:41.600]  Shit.
[40:42.340 --> 40:43.980]  Jesus Christ.
[40:44.380 --> 40:45.240]  That was terrible.
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.800]  That was a pack of turds right there.
[40:46.940 --> 40:48.900]  Holy shit.
[40:51.360 --> 40:51.960]  Oh, here.
[40:52.300 --> 40:53.540]  Is it a pong game?
[40:53.720 --> 40:53.820]  Okay.
[40:55.360 --> 40:57.320]  We got to keep it up.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.540]  Oh, that's me.
[41:01.740 --> 41:02.080]  Sorry.
[41:02.620 --> 41:03.140]  That was a bad one.
[41:03.140 --> 41:03.700]  Oh!
[41:05.760 --> 41:07.120]  That was almost really good.
[41:07.720 --> 41:08.940]  That was horrible.
[41:10.300 --> 41:11.580]  It's tough
[41:11.580 --> 41:12.680]  when you're chasing it.
[41:14.340 --> 41:15.480]  Oh my God.
[41:15.760 --> 41:17.140]  It takes the worst hops.
[41:18.640 --> 41:19.940]  You're just a little
[41:19.940 --> 41:21.040]  too slow for it.
[41:24.340 --> 41:24.980]  Textbook.
[41:26.480 --> 41:27.540]  We'll work together.
[41:28.400 --> 41:29.200]  Oh my God.
[41:35.780 --> 41:36.480]  Whoops.
[41:39.640 --> 41:40.340]  Whoops.
[41:42.880 --> 41:44.140]  It's just silence.
[41:44.480 --> 41:46.400]  What kind of bullshit hop is that?
[41:46.620 --> 41:47.320]  That was dumb.
[41:48.500 --> 41:49.620]  Let's just keep it in between.
[41:52.220 --> 41:52.920]  Squeeze!
[41:53.660 --> 41:54.220]  Any thoughts?
[41:54.920 --> 41:57.460]  I think...
[41:57.460 --> 41:58.340]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[41:59.780 --> 42:00.400]  Whoa.
[42:06.270 --> 42:07.070]  Fuck me.
[42:08.210 --> 42:08.830]  Ah.
[42:12.620 --> 42:13.880]  Bounced off me faster.
[42:16.100 --> 42:16.720]  Yep.
[42:17.160 --> 42:17.740]  Good recovery.
[42:18.400 --> 42:18.620]  Yeah!
[42:23.130 --> 42:23.440]  No!
[42:26.960 --> 42:28.520]  What's the closest we've done?
[42:28.800 --> 42:30.680]  We only needed, I think, three left.
[42:30.680 --> 42:31.420]  Ugh.
[42:32.960 --> 42:34.860]  This one's like not even anyone's fault.
[42:35.460 --> 42:36.740]  No, I don't blame anybody
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.700]  for anything. I blame me.
[42:38.560 --> 42:40.080]  Yeah, I kind of blame Gavin.
[42:40.500 --> 42:41.220]  Okay, I'll do that.
[42:42.340 --> 42:43.700]  Who suggested this game for the stream?
[42:44.380 --> 42:44.640]  Andrew.
[42:45.460 --> 42:46.620]  I blame Andrew.
[42:49.460 --> 42:49.900]  Ah!
[42:54.080 --> 42:56.460]  I think you just have to be really mindful of it trying to hit
[42:56.460 --> 42:58.320]  the middle of your paddle.
[43:00.040 --> 43:00.420]  That's...
[43:00.420 --> 43:01.520]  I mean, what are you supposed to do there?
[43:02.060 --> 43:02.860]  You're just boned.
[43:04.820 --> 43:05.200]  Sorry.
[43:05.360 --> 43:07.620]  If we could just trap it between two people, that'd be awesome.
[43:08.840 --> 43:08.980]  Ah!
[43:14.560 --> 43:14.940]  Well...
[43:14.940 --> 43:15.420]  Did you like that?
[43:17.420 --> 43:17.800]  Sorry.
[43:18.560 --> 43:18.920]  Eric.
[43:23.900 --> 43:25.820]  This isn't even, like...
[43:25.820 --> 43:26.440]  upsetting.
[43:26.860 --> 43:28.620]  It's frustrating in a way where you go,
[43:28.620 --> 43:31.020]  Oh, why did you do this?
[43:31.360 --> 43:31.680]  Nice!
[43:32.620 --> 43:33.620]  Good job!
[43:35.500 --> 43:36.700]  We're out of here.
[43:37.020 --> 43:38.300]  It's like not even...
[43:38.300 --> 43:40.140]  Wait, the chat.
[43:40.400 --> 43:42.460]  Can you trap it? No, we did it.
[43:42.540 --> 43:42.860]  Twice.
[43:43.340 --> 43:44.700]  No, I don't mean trap it, like hold it.
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.800]  But trying to get it there
[43:48.800 --> 43:49.680]  was like...
[43:49.680 --> 43:52.240]  Oh, what?
[43:52.380 --> 43:53.500]  Who are you?
[43:53.500 --> 43:54.360]  Holy shit.
[43:55.580 --> 43:56.040]  Uh...
[43:57.040 --> 43:58.340]  Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[43:58.460 --> 43:58.880]  Nobody move.
[44:00.500 --> 44:00.960]  Okay.
[44:02.400 --> 44:05.420]  How do you...
[44:05.420 --> 44:06.160]  Ugh.
[44:07.640 --> 44:08.560]  Ah, shit.
[44:09.700 --> 44:10.520]  Oh, God.
[44:10.740 --> 44:11.640]  Oh, my God.
[44:11.920 --> 44:13.540]  Okay, hang on.
[44:14.140 --> 44:16.040]  Geoff is gonna go first. Geoff, just move right.
[44:17.860 --> 44:19.400]  Okay, so that's you.
[44:19.560 --> 44:21.060]  I'm moving right.
[44:21.060 --> 44:22.960]  Wait, okay, I know which one I am.
[44:24.180 --> 44:25.240]  Everyone has to...
[44:25.240 --> 44:27.180]  You gotta call out and say
[44:27.180 --> 44:28.300]  what, like, after you got it.
[44:29.860 --> 44:30.840]  I'm that one.
[44:31.100 --> 44:31.840]  Got it.
[44:33.500 --> 44:34.240]  Fuck, sorry.
[44:34.440 --> 44:35.020]  Oh, no!
[44:36.300 --> 44:38.240]  Geoff, you're gonna go first. Let us know when you have it.
[44:38.900 --> 44:39.100]  Okay.
[44:41.960 --> 44:42.600]  I got it.
[44:44.240 --> 44:44.600]  Uh...
[44:44.600 --> 44:45.560]  Okay, I got it, I got it.
[44:46.280 --> 44:46.840]  I'll go.
[44:48.080 --> 44:49.020]  Someone else is going.
[44:49.340 --> 44:50.420]  I've got it.
[44:50.640 --> 44:51.340]  I got mine.
[44:52.260 --> 44:54.160]  I didn't get a chance to move.
[44:56.200 --> 44:57.180]  I got mine.
[44:57.840 --> 44:58.220]  Oh, shit.
[44:59.260 --> 45:01.220]  It's gonna be Geoff, me, Nick,
[45:01.320 --> 45:02.160]  Gavin, Andrew.
[45:02.560 --> 45:03.720]  So, Geoff, you gotta be quick.
[45:05.620 --> 45:06.280]  Alright, I'm good.
[45:07.080 --> 45:07.740]  Okay, I got mine.
[45:10.260 --> 45:10.820]  Got it.
[45:11.740 --> 45:12.440]  I got mine.
[45:14.000 --> 45:14.920]  Okay, I think I have mine.
[45:19.230 --> 45:20.810]  Nice. Yay!
[45:21.510 --> 45:23.150]  Get us outta here.
[45:23.450 --> 45:25.290]  You just have to... there just has to be an order.
[45:27.310 --> 45:27.830]  Order!
[45:29.790 --> 45:30.830]  World clear!
[45:31.270 --> 45:32.910]  Special pack, easy, baby mode,
[45:33.050 --> 45:34.990]  don't even care. That took us, what, 15 minutes?
[45:35.070 --> 45:35.870]  The last one took 30?
[45:35.950 --> 45:40.130]  Oh, we got ourselves some handy gadgets.
[45:40.370 --> 45:40.850]  Oh, no.
[45:40.870 --> 45:42.110]  God, no.
[45:42.570 --> 45:42.890]  What?
[45:44.170 --> 45:46.010]  I turned Geoff into a cube.
[45:46.910 --> 45:47.430]  Oh!
[45:49.330 --> 45:50.190]  Do you think
[45:50.190 --> 45:51.690]  cube survives?
[45:52.270 --> 45:53.050]  Maybe. Yeah.
[45:53.630 --> 45:55.470]  You got it, you're cubed.
[45:55.750 --> 45:56.810]  Alright, you're safe then.
[45:57.030 --> 45:58.030]  Somebody cube me on top of him.
[45:58.130 --> 45:58.650]  Why?
[46:01.010 --> 46:02.550]  That was nuts.
[46:03.950 --> 46:04.910]  Cube me!
[46:07.730 --> 46:09.190]  Alright. Okay.
[46:10.870 --> 46:11.910]  Okay, it looks like
[46:13.330 --> 46:14.930]  we need Andrew to come this way.
[46:14.930 --> 46:15.030]  Okay.
[46:17.430 --> 46:18.950]  So, what do you think?
[46:19.110 --> 46:21.190]  I don't... I was really afraid to walk on this.
[46:21.510 --> 46:21.990]  Me too.
[46:23.290 --> 46:23.750]  Thank you.
[46:24.570 --> 46:27.410]  Do we cube up and maybe...
[46:27.410 --> 46:29.070]  Let's see what's on the other side
[46:29.070 --> 46:30.470]  first. Oh, geez.
[46:30.690 --> 46:32.390]  Oh yeah, cube the thing and see if I get
[46:32.890 --> 46:34.190]  killed. Yeah.
[46:35.270 --> 46:36.910]  Nick, you have to move, so does Geoff.
[46:38.430 --> 46:38.930]  Got a key!
[46:39.690 --> 46:41.130]  Oh, put the floor back.
[46:43.410 --> 46:44.730]  I know what we have to do.
[46:44.770 --> 46:47.110]  I know what we have to do. I died just so we can get
[46:47.110 --> 46:47.430]  through it.
[46:49.090 --> 46:50.410]  Let's get through this beginning part
[46:50.770 --> 46:53.450]  and then go back here. So go ahead and hit it.
[46:53.530 --> 46:54.950]  Got it. Okay.
[46:55.830 --> 46:56.870]  Free Gavin. Hit X.
[46:57.390 --> 46:59.090]  There you go. Oh, he can do it on his own?
[46:59.150 --> 47:00.870]  Yep. Oh, okay. So...
[47:01.450 --> 47:03.010]  Nick, you're gonna go all the way to the end
[47:03.010 --> 47:04.670]  but don't hit the button yet. Okay.
[47:05.770 --> 47:07.190]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[47:08.390 --> 47:08.690]  Andrew.
[47:08.690 --> 47:10.650]  Andrew. Yep.
[47:11.150 --> 47:12.690]  Jump on me, but
[47:12.690 --> 47:14.430]  don't become a cube. Gavin, cube
[47:14.430 --> 47:16.270]  me. Oh. Nope.
[47:16.890 --> 47:18.670]  There you go. Gavin, move
[47:18.670 --> 47:20.770]  like two steps left. Nope, that's
[47:20.770 --> 47:22.670]  the right. Like right there.
[47:22.870 --> 47:23.890]  Geoff, cube Gavin.
[47:24.910 --> 47:26.630]  Uh, okay. And then Nick,
[47:26.830 --> 47:28.550]  cube Geoff. Okay.
[47:28.830 --> 47:30.590]  And then Nick, you're gonna hit the button
[47:30.590 --> 47:32.730]  and move right. Alright. Okay.
[47:32.930 --> 47:34.250]  Ready? Yeah.
[47:34.950 --> 47:36.710]  Now, Andrew, you're gonna jump across...
[47:36.710 --> 47:38.350]  Wait, how do we... how the fuck? Ah!
[47:39.330 --> 47:40.790]  Are you gonna say...
[47:40.790 --> 47:42.950]  I thought it was a jump across puzzle.
[47:43.350 --> 47:44.410]  But how do we get across?
[47:44.710 --> 47:46.530]  Maybe we just block the things from hitting
[47:46.530 --> 47:46.990]  the beam.
[47:48.990 --> 47:50.670]  Maybe we just cube so we absorb
[47:50.670 --> 47:52.250]  the hits. Is that what it is?
[47:52.350 --> 47:54.890]  Yeah, just catch spikes and see if it breaks the floor.
[47:55.050 --> 47:55.430]  Oh.
[47:56.550 --> 47:58.510]  So you think that if, like, if I
[47:58.510 --> 48:00.530]  line up here...
[48:00.530 --> 48:01.490]  Yeah. Okay.
[48:01.830 --> 48:04.710]  I think this makes sense. Right, but the person
[48:06.050 --> 48:06.950]  pressing the button
[48:06.950 --> 48:08.150]  will need to become a cube
[48:08.850 --> 48:10.290]  after they've pressed it, I assume.
[48:10.730 --> 48:11.970]  I'll have to cube you, Eric.
[48:12.870 --> 48:14.730]  No, there's only four spots.
[48:14.990 --> 48:15.610]  There's only four.
[48:17.230 --> 48:18.610]  Andrew, can you catch the key?
[48:19.510 --> 48:21.170]  Andrew, cube me
[48:21.170 --> 48:22.570]  and then hit the button.
[48:23.170 --> 48:23.670]  That's what it is.
[48:25.010 --> 48:27.130]  Got it. You can get out of the cube now.
[48:27.550 --> 48:28.710]  There you go. Got it.
[48:28.970 --> 48:30.830]  Sick. I thought it was
[48:30.830 --> 48:31.650]  gonna be a jump puzzle.
[48:31.650 --> 48:33.370]  That makes way more sense.
[48:33.710 --> 48:34.490]  Way easier.
[48:35.890 --> 48:37.450]  You were thinking of big boy moves
[48:37.450 --> 48:39.430]  and this was a baby move. Yes, definitely.
[48:39.770 --> 48:41.570]  I thought it was gonna be like, oh yeah, we gotta platform
[48:41.570 --> 48:42.470]  the fuck outta here.
[48:43.210 --> 48:43.890]  That would've been cool.
[48:45.690 --> 48:47.210]  It'll probably happen in a future level.
[48:47.750 --> 48:48.850]  Oh my gosh. What is this?
[48:50.470 --> 48:51.190]  Don't die.
[48:53.330 --> 48:53.790]  Are you gonna
[48:53.790 --> 48:54.650]  whack the mole or no?
[48:55.590 --> 48:57.630]  You have to have it charged, I think, to do it.
[48:58.530 --> 48:59.610]  Ow, ow, I'm getting knocked
[49:00.030 --> 49:00.350]  senseless.
[49:01.210 --> 49:03.290]  You gonna whack the mole or what's up?
[49:04.550 --> 49:05.750]  Where's the mole? Nick, you're purple.
[49:06.470 --> 49:06.870]  Yeah, I know.
[49:07.670 --> 49:09.670]  The mole was the other way. I don't know, what do you want from me?
[49:09.850 --> 49:11.310]  I wanted you to face the mole and then punch it.
[49:11.810 --> 49:12.210]  I did.
[49:16.480 --> 49:16.800]  Guys.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.760]  I got this one.
[49:20.420 --> 49:22.040]  Geoff has the first one, I have the second one.
[49:22.400 --> 49:23.700]  Yeah. Don't worry,
[49:23.780 --> 49:24.480]  Gavin's hopping around.
[49:25.360 --> 49:26.700]  Doesn't someone have to punch this one?
[49:31.370 --> 49:31.930]  I missed.
[49:33.250 --> 49:33.610]  Alright.
[49:34.110 --> 49:35.410]  Someone's gotta punch that one, don't worry.
[49:35.670 --> 49:36.030]  Guys.
[49:37.550 --> 49:40.150]  Oh, sorry. I was too busy watching Gavin.
[49:40.390 --> 49:40.610]  Cool.
[49:45.160 --> 49:46.140]  You gotta hit twice, Geoff.
[49:46.400 --> 49:47.200]  I don't have to.
[49:48.220 --> 49:49.660]  I'm charging, I'm charging, I'm charging.
[49:50.020 --> 49:50.380]  You got it.
[49:52.940 --> 49:54.340]  Nick, come on, baby.
[49:55.320 --> 49:55.780]  Got it.
[49:56.580 --> 49:57.720]  Alright, big dog, we got it.
[50:00.200 --> 50:00.880]  Oh, I see.
[50:00.940 --> 50:01.740]  It's a different one now.
[50:02.140 --> 50:03.620]  Oh, we have to do it all at once.
[50:04.220 --> 50:04.340]  Yeah.
[50:05.840 --> 50:06.780]  There we go.
[50:08.620 --> 50:09.420]  Let me get all the way...
[50:09.420 --> 50:11.140]  God damn it. Let me get all the way over here, sorry.
[50:11.840 --> 50:12.000]  Ow.
[50:13.260 --> 50:15.760]  I don't know why I keep jumping into this fucking guy, moron.
[50:16.500 --> 50:17.420]  I'll get the...
[50:17.420 --> 50:20.060]  Alright, when everyone's in position, we'll count it down
[50:20.060 --> 50:20.660]  and then we'll do it.
[50:21.500 --> 50:22.700]  Geoff, what do you think this is?
[50:23.300 --> 50:24.520]  I'm just trying to get under there.
[50:24.840 --> 50:27.060]  I'll get the middle one, you get the one on the left.
[50:28.080 --> 50:29.740]  We have to time...
[50:29.740 --> 50:31.060]  How are we going to do this?
[50:31.680 --> 50:33.780]  As they come out, just count and then
[50:33.780 --> 50:35.400]  when they come out, we'll slop them.
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.100]  Who's calling it?
[50:37.360 --> 50:38.400]  I'll call it.
[50:38.460 --> 50:39.820]  Alright, everyone good?
[50:42.480 --> 50:42.920]  Three...
[50:45.500 --> 50:45.940]  Two...
[50:45.940 --> 50:46.500]  One...
[50:46.500 --> 50:47.140]  Next one, guys.
[50:48.220 --> 50:50.400]  I thought one was go, I'm sorry.
[50:51.600 --> 50:53.480]  Why don't we just...
[50:53.480 --> 50:55.820]  put them in the same sequence here?
[50:56.840 --> 50:58.600]  This is taking way too long.
[50:59.580 --> 50:59.940]  Just...
[50:59.940 --> 51:02.040]  What do you mean, just? Alright, stop slamming them.
[51:02.100 --> 51:02.980]  Everyone recharge, right?
[51:03.720 --> 51:05.100]  Not this one, the next one.
[51:06.380 --> 51:07.100]  And... go!
[51:08.120 --> 51:09.400]  Nice. Good job.
[51:09.980 --> 51:12.100]  That was weird. How come we didn't wait for so long?
[51:12.800 --> 51:14.220]  Stack up. Hey, everyone get on top.
[51:15.200 --> 51:16.620]  How come we didn't wait for so long?
[51:19.880 --> 51:20.600]  Yeah, you...
[51:24.680 --> 51:26.720]  I guess we gotta line up so we can all hit.
[51:26.720 --> 51:26.940]  Yep.
[51:32.550 --> 51:33.770]  Do we just do it...
[51:33.770 --> 51:35.370]  Magic, magic, magic.
[51:35.750 --> 51:36.230]  No!
[51:37.430 --> 51:38.830]  Alright, here we go.
[51:39.430 --> 51:40.790]  Just keep hitting X.
[51:43.030 --> 51:43.330]  There we go.
[51:43.510 --> 51:45.170]  Oh, we got down.
[51:48.090 --> 51:48.830]  There we go.
[51:52.760 --> 51:53.980]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[51:54.220 --> 51:55.600]  That's my thought exactly.
[51:56.980 --> 51:57.760]  You had the key.
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.840]  That one was generous to not have a timer on it.
[52:03.100 --> 52:04.680]  What's the next handy gadget?
[52:05.360 --> 52:06.720]  Give me some gadge.
[52:10.440 --> 52:11.180]  Oh no.
[52:12.080 --> 52:12.940]  Oh, we're blocks again.
[52:15.260 --> 52:16.140]  Holy shit.
[52:16.900 --> 52:18.100]  Uh, hey, look out.
[52:19.860 --> 52:20.880]  Alright, why don't we cube
[52:20.880 --> 52:22.260]  the back guy?
[52:23.780 --> 52:24.860]  Why do we cube
[52:24.860 --> 52:26.820]  the back guy? Because then everyone else can keep moving.
[52:27.500 --> 52:28.720]  Okay, how did you...
[52:28.720 --> 52:30.780]  How were you explaining what you wanted to do at die?
[52:30.780 --> 52:33.940]  I wish I could just see exactly what you were picturing.
[52:34.060 --> 52:34.760]  How did you do that?
[52:34.760 --> 52:35.640]  The entire plan.
[52:36.080 --> 52:37.740]  So everyone get here.
[52:37.840 --> 52:40.760]  Shouldn't you cube...
[52:40.760 --> 52:41.140]  You?
[52:41.680 --> 52:44.380]  Yeah, shouldn't you cube three people on the top?
[52:45.160 --> 52:46.600]  Three people? Damn, alright.
[52:48.820 --> 52:50.820]  I want Gavin to keep explaining it
[52:50.820 --> 52:52.660]  and then dying. I think that's awesome.
[52:53.300 --> 52:54.300]  It's cool, yeah.
[52:54.680 --> 52:55.680]  So, like,
[52:56.320 --> 52:57.760]  if I'm up here,
[52:58.460 --> 52:59.840]  if me, Andrew, and Geoff
[52:59.840 --> 53:01.980]  are on the top...
[53:01.980 --> 53:02.820]  Where am I?
[53:04.360 --> 53:05.400]  Everyone has to be in front,
[53:05.580 --> 53:06.020]  surely, though.
[53:07.840 --> 53:09.640]  So, I'm not sure what I'm being
[53:09.640 --> 53:10.180]  unclear about.
[53:11.240 --> 53:13.700]  Two people on the bottom, three people standing
[53:13.700 --> 53:14.260]  on their heads.
[53:15.800 --> 53:16.240]  Okay.
[53:18.440 --> 53:19.740]  Stop jumping on me.
[53:21.980 --> 53:22.860]  Shoot Geoff.
[53:23.100 --> 53:24.280]  Jump up and shoot Geoff, Gavin.
[53:26.240 --> 53:26.940]  Why not?
[53:27.880 --> 53:28.180]  I guess.
[53:28.280 --> 53:32.260]  I need you guys to get behind me.
[53:32.320 --> 53:34.380]  Nick, yeah, I think you have to...
[53:34.380 --> 53:34.760]  I can't jump.
[53:35.920 --> 53:38.040]  And then I think...
[53:38.040 --> 53:40.020]  Oh, it doesn't move with them?
[53:40.340 --> 53:41.240]  That's a bummer.
[53:42.240 --> 53:42.680]  Okay.
[53:43.920 --> 53:46.240]  So why don't we just have the person in the back...
[53:46.240 --> 53:46.840]  Somebody shoot me!
[53:48.120 --> 53:49.520]  The person in the back do what?
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.180]  Be the cube.
[53:51.840 --> 53:52.780]  What is that?
[53:54.040 --> 53:55.240]  Okay, let's just do it.
[54:00.080 --> 54:01.180]  Stop moving, cube!
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.680]  Why are you not
[54:03.680 --> 54:04.620]  becoming the cube, Gavin?
[54:04.840 --> 54:07.040]  Does it go back up or does it stay down on the cube?
[54:07.260 --> 54:09.020]  We'll find out when you cube one of us.
[54:09.340 --> 54:11.720]  Cube me! Cube me!
[54:12.240 --> 54:12.440]  Yeah!
[54:13.440 --> 54:14.520]  Okay, it uncubes.
[54:15.720 --> 54:16.700]  You uncubed yourself.
[54:16.700 --> 54:17.460]  We were halfway there.
[54:19.400 --> 54:20.540]  That kind of worked.
[54:22.960 --> 54:23.500]  Cube me!
[54:26.700 --> 54:28.160]  I thought we really...
[54:28.160 --> 54:29.680]  I thought we locked in on something there.
[54:30.720 --> 54:32.620]  If you're in line with the cube, do you get killed?
[54:33.680 --> 54:34.600]  I don't think so.
[54:36.140 --> 54:37.080]  I will never know.
[54:37.680 --> 54:38.620]  Didn't think that would kill me.
[54:39.300 --> 54:40.900]  That's on me. 100%.
[54:41.440 --> 54:42.080]  My bad.
[54:42.360 --> 54:44.940]  I'd like to apologize to everyone.
[54:45.780 --> 54:46.800]  Alright, and then we'll...
[54:46.800 --> 54:48.380]  And then we'll see if this...
[54:48.380 --> 54:50.820]  Yeah, so you have to have it stacked at least twice.
[54:53.260 --> 54:53.620]  Stack...
[54:53.620 --> 54:54.740]  So we'll cube two people.
[54:57.240 --> 54:58.580]  Alright, so someone get on my head.
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.020]  And then cube the both of us.
[55:01.040 --> 55:01.580]  Okay, ready?
[55:01.880 --> 55:02.140]  No!
[55:03.620 --> 55:06.060]  Okay, 3, 2, 1, cube!
[55:06.400 --> 55:07.540]  Oh wait, I need to cube...
[55:07.540 --> 55:09.300]  Nick can't move yet.
[55:10.180 --> 55:11.500]  You started walking!
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.020]  Also, yeah, he'll leave me in the...
[55:13.840 --> 55:15.160]  What do you mean, sidewalking?
[55:15.480 --> 55:16.100]  You have to get under it.
[55:16.100 --> 55:17.620]  You started walking before you stopped counting!
[55:20.340 --> 55:21.100]  Alright, you count.
[55:22.400 --> 55:23.520]  3, 2, 1, cube us.
[55:24.640 --> 55:25.460]  Geoff, do you know what you're doing?
[55:25.920 --> 55:27.740]  I'm gonna shoot him on the 3, 2, 1, cube-a.
[55:28.060 --> 55:28.320]  Okay.
[55:28.800 --> 55:31.200]  Alright, cube-a. Cube-a.
[55:32.500 --> 55:33.100]  Oh, interesting.
[55:33.140 --> 55:35.380]  I think that's all we have to do, and then we just go.
[55:35.720 --> 55:36.300]  We're free to go.
[55:36.800 --> 55:38.960]  Bye, Gavin. Well, let's see what's on the other side now.
[55:38.960 --> 55:40.780]  Okay, door. Hang on, hang on.
[55:40.900 --> 55:41.720]  And then do it again.
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.020]  Now, Nick, jump on top of Andrew.
[55:44.580 --> 55:46.520]  Okay. That's Geoff.
[55:46.840 --> 55:48.960]  And then, Geoff, you're gonna
[55:49.680 --> 55:51.000]  get me close, and Nick, you're gonna
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.120]  cube me. Ready?
[55:53.200 --> 55:54.180]  Now, go, go, go!
[55:55.480 --> 55:56.460]  No, not quite.
[55:56.780 --> 55:57.280]  Okay, more.
[55:59.160 --> 56:00.500]  Do you think that's enough?
[56:00.600 --> 56:02.160]  Do you think it got me? Let's do it.
[56:03.440 --> 56:04.200]  Yep, that's it.
[56:05.060 --> 56:05.420]  Move!
[56:05.420 --> 56:05.700]  Move!
[56:07.600 --> 56:08.460]  What's the key?
[56:09.660 --> 56:10.200]  Oh, dear.
[56:11.100 --> 56:13.080]  We have to cube through them.
[56:13.520 --> 56:15.760]  I don't think it's a death hole, though.
[56:16.420 --> 56:17.040]  You don't think so?
[56:17.480 --> 56:18.000]  Okay, cool.
[56:19.420 --> 56:21.240]  Cube me! Hang on. Cube me!
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.000]  Okay. Cube me!
[56:23.920 --> 56:24.680]  Cube me!
[56:25.180 --> 56:26.900]  Yeah! You cubed him.
[56:28.100 --> 56:28.580]  Now what?
[56:29.560 --> 56:30.380]  Now cube Geoff!
[56:30.380 --> 56:33.180]  Now cube Geoff!
[56:33.900 --> 56:34.500]  Now cube Geoff!
[56:36.500 --> 56:37.880]  Okay, Geoff, come over here.
[56:38.480 --> 56:40.420]  I'll cube purple. Jump purple, and I'll cube you.
[56:41.060 --> 56:42.360]  Well, that actually
[56:42.980 --> 56:43.640]  might work.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.020]  Yeah, Geoff, go get the key.
[56:50.700 --> 56:51.860]  You're gonna hit your head, though.
[56:54.740 --> 56:55.900]  Now cube him again.
[56:56.620 --> 56:58.260]  No, I think he has to be further out.
[56:58.280 --> 56:59.060]  I have to be further out.
[56:59.060 --> 56:59.340]  Yeah.
[57:04.610 --> 57:05.810]  You wanna jump, Nick?
[57:06.090 --> 57:06.770]  Yeah, shoot me.
[57:07.370 --> 57:08.190]  Sorry, it's slow.
[57:08.930 --> 57:09.690]  Okay, I'll jump.
[57:10.070 --> 57:11.590]  Okay, me.
[57:14.710 --> 57:15.070]  Nice!
[57:15.670 --> 57:19.150]  Oh, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
[57:20.430 --> 57:21.830]  There's no one for me to jump on.
[57:22.830 --> 57:23.850]  We're too far out.
[57:25.110 --> 57:26.430]  Geoff and I might be able to reach it.
[57:26.470 --> 57:27.130]  Geoff, can you come down here?
[57:27.130 --> 57:28.510]  I don't think so.
[57:31.760 --> 57:32.480]  Oh, okay.
[57:32.860 --> 57:33.420]  No, okay.
[57:36.420 --> 57:37.700]  Because it's three people.
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.180]  Yeah, I mean, we could
[57:40.180 --> 57:42.120]  definitely move Gavin a little to the left and Nick
[57:42.120 --> 57:44.080]  a little to the left and then have this work.
[57:44.740 --> 57:48.540]  Cube me! Cube me! Cube me!
[57:48.920 --> 57:49.640]  Oh, I ran out of gun.
[57:50.900 --> 57:51.800]  You're too far, I think.
[57:51.860 --> 57:52.940]  Yeah, you gotta be a little closer.
[57:54.600 --> 57:56.580]  Stop jumping on me to go.
[58:00.090 --> 58:03.930]  Cube me! Cube me! Cube me!
[58:05.010 --> 58:07.090]  Maybe hesitate for just a second.
[58:07.210 --> 58:08.570]  Yeah, what if he just keeps pushing the button?
[58:09.530 --> 58:09.970]  Okay, ready?
[58:10.410 --> 58:10.670]  No.
[58:11.390 --> 58:11.890]  Okay.
[58:14.030 --> 58:15.410]  A little close.
[58:16.050 --> 58:17.650]  I mean, that'll...
[58:17.650 --> 58:18.150]  Cube me!
[58:19.230 --> 58:20.390]  That's the right distance.
[58:21.650 --> 58:22.970]  Should I not jump?
[58:24.230 --> 58:25.450]  No, I think you shouldn't jump.
[58:25.450 --> 58:25.970]  Okay.
[58:26.850 --> 58:27.970]  I got it.
[58:29.390 --> 58:30.350]  Really good.
[58:30.730 --> 58:31.930]  I don't know if we're gonna make that.
[58:32.290 --> 58:34.230]  I think Nick might need to move a little bit.
[58:35.010 --> 58:36.570]  I think it should be Andrew this time.
[58:38.230 --> 58:38.830]  That's it.
[58:39.450 --> 58:40.310]  That should be perfect.
[58:41.310 --> 58:41.510]  Nice.
[58:42.190 --> 58:44.630]  Now we should be able to get just...
[58:44.630 --> 58:45.190]  Yep, that's it.
[58:47.090 --> 58:48.330]  In the ground!
[58:49.270 --> 58:50.130]  That's nice of it.
[58:50.990 --> 58:52.130]  Good teamwork, boys.
[58:52.130 --> 58:54.490]  Way to go, Gavin!
[58:54.690 --> 58:55.810]  One more time!
[58:56.210 --> 58:57.310]  One more time!
[58:59.850 --> 59:00.490]  How?!
[59:00.490 --> 59:02.790]  Gavin, that took fucking forever!
[59:04.910 --> 59:05.550]  How?!
[59:05.550 --> 59:06.130]  I just...
[59:06.770 --> 59:07.370]  I need a minute.
[59:09.090 --> 59:09.410]  Okay.
[59:10.970 --> 59:12.010]  Okay, here we go.
[59:12.730 --> 59:14.750]  That's gotta count for ten deaths on the spreadsheet.
[59:15.170 --> 59:18.430]  That was the most egregious thing I've ever seen.
[59:19.210 --> 59:20.350]  Oh my god.
[59:20.350 --> 59:22.190]  I was shooting him to make it quicker.
[59:22.390 --> 59:24.790]  I don't blame you, I just said you'd die.
[59:24.830 --> 59:25.650]  I blame Gavin.
[59:25.950 --> 59:28.170]  I absolutely blame Gavin.
[59:28.170 --> 59:31.450]  I couldn't believe we did it before 5-0-1 and I was looking at the time.
[59:32.850 --> 59:34.790]  Come get on top of me and move forward a little.
[59:36.450 --> 59:38.790]  I did what you said.
[59:40.170 --> 59:40.910]  Oh, Gavin.
[59:41.730 --> 59:42.970]  We remember how to do this.
[59:43.810 --> 59:44.930]  I think it's really easy.
[59:45.050 --> 59:46.170]  Just talk to Gavin about it.
[59:47.010 --> 59:47.590]  Cue me!
[59:48.230 --> 59:50.890]  Do you think that's what we did before?
[59:51.370 --> 59:51.770]  No.
[59:52.490 --> 59:52.750]  Okay.
[59:56.190 --> 59:56.990]  I just...
[59:56.990 --> 59:58.370]  I don't know...
[59:59.550 --> 01:00:00.610]  I don't know what to do.
[01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.150]  Nick, walk me over.
[01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.610]  Oh, man.
[01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.110]  Yeah, I was about to walk you over. Sorry, man.
[01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.610]  I don't think I've ever been this demoralized
[01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:11.550]  ever in any game.
[01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.570]  Let's do this for real style, though, okay?
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.890]  So here we are.
[01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:17.350]  Gavin, walk me over.
[01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:20.070]  Push him in and shoot him.
[01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:23.150]  I just don't understand what any of that was.
[01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.230]  What are you doing?
[01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.950]  I hit the fucking shoot button. It didn't turn him into a thing.
[01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:29.030]  I don't know why they didn't move under while it was going up.
[01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:31.490]  He moved enough.
[01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:32.170]  So you can do this.
[01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:35.470]  And then cube Eric, someone.
[01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:36.890]  Just wait a second.
[01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:40.350]  Okay, now I can go under
[01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:41.270]  and then you can shoot me.
[01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:42.990]  Why would
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.190]  we shoot you?
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.430]  Oh, my God. Okay.
[01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:47.250]  It's fine.
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.150]  It's such an easier way
[01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.570]  than what I just presented, but that's fine.
[01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.650]  Let's do what you're saying.
[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.750]  Oh, my God.
[01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:57.730]  You're welcome.
[01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.110]  Okay.
[01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.970]  Geoff.
[01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:06.190]  Geoff.
[01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:08.970]  I was trying to cube somebody.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.870]  I'm not blaming you.
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:12.910]  I thought it was funny that you're just unloading.
[01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.430]  Okay, wait.
[01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.510]  So listen. Stan, Geoff, yeah.
[01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.390]  Okay, now Geoff, you look that way.
[01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:19.930]  Now I'm going to go boop.
[01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.110]  And now shoot, shoot, shoot.
[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.490]  Now go boop.
[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:27.190]  Okay, I need to be higher, but that's...
[01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.930]  It's really easy.
[01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.890]  Five on one, baby!
[01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.310]  I had a dinner reservation.
[01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:37.090]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.130]  What are you talking about?
[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.210]  I just don't know what you're doing.
[01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.310]  I was getting the thing to come down
[01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.770]  and then Andrew blocked me from coming back.
[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:46.390]  I didn't do anything.
[01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:48.290]  Right, you blocked him.
[01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:51.510]  It wasn't your fault, but it was...
[01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.150]  Alright, cube me.
[01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.370]  There, okay.
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.350]  Alright.
[01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:57.590]  How did Geoff get cubed?
[01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.950]  Great question.
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:00.570]  Alright, now do it on the other side.
[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:05.150]  There.
[01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:06.390]  That works.
[01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.670]  That works.
[01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:11.350]  Easy, Gavin.
[01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:13.330]  Cube me!
[01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:16.170]  Too far.
[01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:17.710]  I'll cube you the middle.
[01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:19.270]  Okay.
[01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.150]  No, that's useless.
[01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:22.570]  Cube me.
[01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:26.670]  Geoff, you've cubed me.
[01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.390]  That's pretty good.
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.450]  Yeah, that works.
[01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:31.550]  There you go.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:32.850]  Nailed!
[01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:35.970]  Come on, fellas.
[01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.790]  We're gonna do it this time, Gavin.
[01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:38.870]  What?
[01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.830]  Don't walk so far to the left, please.
[01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:43.890]  Whoo!
[01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.010]  501!
[01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:46.050]  502!
[01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:52.970]  Happy 501.
[01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:53.450]  Alright!
[01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:57.650]  501 PM, best time of the week,
[01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:58.750]  and we did it.
[01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.730]  Insane.
[01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.410]  We got one more we gotta do.
[01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.930]  Some of us have dinner reservations, so we better make it fast.
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.050]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:06.690]  Better talk to Gavin.
[01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:09.010]  We're gonna punch this ghost.
[01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:11.150]  Line up.
[01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.950]  What?
[01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:15.790]  We need to run.
[01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:19.130]  Whoever's on the bottom doesn't punch, they just move.
[01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.710]  Andrew, you don't punch, you just move.
[01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:23.410]  And then we'll just lamp the bastard?
[01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.310]  Yeah, lamp that son of a bitch.
[01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:25.890]  Lamp!
[01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.870]  Oh, my God!
[01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:29.010]  He punches!
[01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:30.910]  He's got range!
[01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:32.510]  So you've also got dodge his punch.
[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.550]  How?
[01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:36.650]  Green, you would move for them to dodge.
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.170]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.130]  We'll probably have to move on our own, too.
[01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.430]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:46.070]  I was so locked in on being bottom
[01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:46.950]  last time, that was me.
[01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.690]  Totally my fault.
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.290]  Okay, now bottom again.
[01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:53.790]  So, Gavin, you gotta move them in and out when he punches.
[01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:54.670]  Big time.
[01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:57.430]  Oh, I went too early, I'm sorry.
[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.170]  You gotta be careful not to go past my head.
[01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:02.810]  Yeah.
[01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.210]  Okay, now Gavin's at bottom.
[01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:08.070]  Geoff, you're bobbing and weaving for us.
[01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.750]  Okay.
[01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.130]  Punch the fist.
[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:16.210]  I think you can punch the fist.
[01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:18.770]  What? We were out of range
[01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:19.390]  for sure!
[01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.850]  Eternal Asgard, thanks for the ten subs.
[01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.470]  Oh, my God, thank you so much,
[01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.070]  Eternal Asgard.
[01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:28.830]  Why are we staggered?
[01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:30.350]  Yeah, it's a...
[01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:30.950]  Well, we all missed.
[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:34.430]  Well, with it being staggered,
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.930]  I could hit him without him punching me.
[01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:36.590]  Okay.
[01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.350]  Okay.
[01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:41.950]  Oh, I'm running.
[01:04:43.070 --> 01:04:44.430]  I just don't know how Eric's gonna get
[01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.210]  a punch in at this point.
[01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:47.370]  That's very fair.
[01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.410]  Oh, you can punch his glove back.
[01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:52.010]  Oh!
[01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.450]  Oh!
[01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.510]  Oh!
[01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.150]  Guys, I think we got this.
[01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.970]  I just don't know why you're moving if you're not the first or second person.
[01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:04.230]  Alright, let me know when you're ready.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.700]  Hang on, Geoff, you gotta get as close as you can.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:13.700]  Geoff...
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.000]  Geoff...
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.860]  I don't like the running, I like punching.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.080]  Hehehehehe.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.380]  Geoff, those are Eric's reservations, man.
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.220]  I hope they're good.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.100]  Get us there.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.100]  Please, no more.
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.300]  We all died together.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.800]  You guys are staggered way out.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:41.940]  Missed.
[01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.030]  Can one person just punch?
[01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.550]  I just don't know why you guys are staggered so far.
[01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:58.150]  Yes, yes, yes!
[01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:04.830]  It's the dinner reservations.
[01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:06.090]  Yeah.
[01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.450]  Red needs to go back.
[01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.130]  There you go.
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:14.270]  If you're...
[01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.930]  Yeah, keep going, keep going, mash it!
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:16.710]  Mash it!
[01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:19.610]  Geoff, are you hitting, like, left?
[01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:21.370]  What do you mean?
[01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.410]  What do you mean am I hitting left?
[01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.930]  And what, to punch the guy?
[01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.730]  It, like, you just look like you're moving.
[01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:30.930]  Geoff, Geoff, get us in there!
[01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.730]  Go, go, go!
[01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:34.710]  Punch left central!
[01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:35.990]  Eric!
[01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:37.470]  What?
[01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.390]  We didn't move to the right.
[01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:41.170]  Do I need to move to the right?
[01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:43.270]  Aren't you dodging the fist if you're second place?
[01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.850]  You guys are staggered so far out, I just don't understand.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.140]  You guys are staggered so far...
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.260]  Like, if you're on the top, you need to, like, go left
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.420]  and then go back to the right, and then go left again.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:58.100]  Like...
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.660]  If you're on the top, you need to go left and right?
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.780]  Look, you're, like, look at how far...
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.040]  There we go.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.480]  See how we're all even now?
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.480]  But then don't I have to dodge the fist?
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:08.760]  Yeah.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.540]  I thought we were punching the fist back, am I crazy?
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.860]  I've been dodging the fist because I was told to dodge the fist.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.460]  Can you move the fist?
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.260]  I thought we were punching the fist back.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:18.740]  Alright.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.180]  Well, start punching it back.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.180]  This is making sure you have a punch
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.460]  charged for the fist.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.120]  Okay, so the second
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.460]  person up should save the...
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.680]  Alright, I'll save my save.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.060]  You're a punch guy?
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.360]  Okay.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.680]  So, yeah, we can't punch the fist back.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.700]  I just did. Did you?
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.020]  Yeah, but we still died.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.000]  Doesn't he just move his fist back?
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.080]  Yeah, I don't know that we're punching the...
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.220]  Maybe I don't know that we're actually hitting it or not.
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.460]  Yeah, he just retreats his fist.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.440]  We just gotta get in there and then...
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.940]  Purple! Nice. Back in.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.160]  Back in. Get away.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.200]  Oh, shit. My bad. That's my bad. Sorry.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.720]  No, no, no. You did great.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.960]  You were doing great there, Nick. Good work.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:03.980]  Uh-oh.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.200]  Alright, Andrew, I guess you're gonna have to
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.060]  left and right it.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.880]  I'm the running man.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.520]  Oh, sorry. That's my bad.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:12.520]  Oh!
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:12.740]  Oh!
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.500]  Do you think dinner's gonna be good?
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.280]  I hope so.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.940]  It's at a Michelin-starred restaurant.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.120]  Fancy boy. Ooh, that's new.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:28.560]  Whoops.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.300]  Yeah.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.480]  My bad. Fuck.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.800]  I panicked.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.160]  I just wanna get some McDonald's.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.660]  I'm hungry.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.860]  Michelin-starred McDonald's?
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.960]  Just McDonald's.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.400]  I can't reach.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.660]  I'm not helping.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.680]  Good try.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.240]  Nick, did you walk off?
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.880]  No. He killed us.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:07.760]  Okay.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.540]  Locked in.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.640]  Good hits, good hits, good hits.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.280]  Oh, fucking...
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.200]  How did the top two get killed?
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.340]  I don't...
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.500]  I guess I'm out too far? I don't know.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.560]  Geoff, did you move that time?
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.360]  Fuck no.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.220]  I mean, I punched when it was time to punch.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.220]  Okay, here we go.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.500]  Alright, me and Gavin. Here we go.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.020]  Oh no, don't make me run!
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:39.980]  I'm the worst runner!
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.400]  I think blue and orange are too far out.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.160]  I can't tell.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.720]  Yeah. Yeah, they are.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.320]  No!
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.320]  Bring us home.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.780]  Geoff, you're not going to hit there.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.020]  Oh.
[01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.090]  Nice dodge.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.860]  So am I dodging or just punching?
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.020]  Can't tell. I think you're...
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.180]  I think you're punching.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:36.140]  Okay.
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:40.640]  Yeah, but if Nick can't speed up, how are we going to dodge if the second person doesn't dodge?
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.300]  I don't know.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.980]  Maybe two of us need to reserve our glove to punch his glove back.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.100]  I don't know.
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.440]  This doesn't feel right.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.680]  The way it's staggered does not feel right right now.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:51.840]  No, it's not at all.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.200]  I'm not slowing down, guys. I'm at this speed.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.080]  I'm at a brisk pace.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.940]  We're just far enough away to not get hit, but I can't reach him.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:00.420]  Yeah.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.680]  Oh, shit. Kill him.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:03.460]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.480]  We need no missed punches from all of us.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.140]  We hit him down.
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.560]  I had an under seven there, is that right?
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:10.700]  Six or seven, yeah.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.440]  How did it kill Geoff?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.640]  I moved away from it because I was scared it was going to kill me.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.120]  I don't know.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.000]  Oh, no. Not me, the runner.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.540]  Oh, look at those lined up feists.
[01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.630]  I think I waited a hair too long. Sorry.
[01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:37.330]  That's okay.
[01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.010]  Oh, damn it.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:48.720]  Get us in there.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.480]  Yes. Whack. Whack.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.160]  I don't know how you died, Gavin.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.080]  How did I die?
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.200]  Shit.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.320]  Geoff, you just run. I'll control the dodging for us.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.420]  Get us in there, though.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.680]  We've got to be a little close.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.720]  We're right on his ass.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.080]  Amazing dodge. Keep whacking him.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.620]  Keep getting him. That's it.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.420]  Come on.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.880]  No! Damn it. We had him.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.120]  That's close.
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.220]  What did we have him down to there?
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.980]  I wasn't sure. I didn't see it.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.020]  It was pretty low.
[01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:32.450]  He got me, it looks like.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.140]  No.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.260]  God, no.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.620]  Eat that. Eat that, you son of a bitch.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.380]  I think the top two
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.920]  were just over a hair to the left too much.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:55.220]  Yeah, I think it might
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.020]  be like a kill
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.220]  wall and not necessarily representative of
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:12:59.740]  the fist.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:02.700]  That makes sense.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.300]  God, we don't all
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.380]  need to move. Holy shit.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.240]  Yeah, I think just the second in line
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:09.720]  needs to move.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.220]  I'm here again. The top three should just line
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:17.100]  up perfectly on the fourth person's head.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.640]  And then...
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.220]  What the fuck?
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:24.600]  And then
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.680]  the second person should dodge.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.780]  I'm hoping that
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.620]  Andrew's the second person.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.320]  Because he was really good at it.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:32.580]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.040]  You were the second person, Gavin.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:38.940]  I didn't die.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.640]  Uh oh.
[01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:52.570]  Let's try.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:56.980]  Oops.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.520]  Alright, this is gonna be dodge central.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.100]  Watch this.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.880]  Oh, that was nice.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:07.800]  Couple more.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.640]  Everyone moved.
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.300]  I didn't move.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.720]  I was...
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.700]  not supposed to be moving.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.420]  Okay.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:17.860]  I'm at the bottom.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.460]  This is it. This is the combo.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.580]  Keep him coming.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.320]  Keep walloping.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.500]  That's it, Gavin. Just mash it.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.200]  Come on, baby.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.700]  Shit, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.180]  Overstepped slightly, I'm so sorry.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:35.300]  That was fucking it.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.540]  You nailed it, though.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.180]  That's the pattern.
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.640]  This is it.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:43.560]  The line.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:45.720]  Keep him whacked.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.520]  Wow. Holy shit.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.960]  We were all the way on the right on that one.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.440]  And still.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.380]  Eric, are you okay?
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:56.760]  Yep.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.540]  Geoff, you're doing such a good job.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:10.900]  So are you, Gavin.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.540]  Kill it!
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.020]  We got it, we got it.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:16.640]  Woohoo!
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.720]  Good job, everybody.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.540]  Get in the car, Geoff.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.100]  Oh, the Peek-a-Park.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:22.860]  Really good work.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.480]  More handy gadgets.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.620]  Great job, everybody.
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.520]  Good job, guys.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.380]  What a stream.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.960]  That was a butthole clincher right there.
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:33.700]  Anus.
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.360]  Get out of here, handy gadgets.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:38.500]  And what's the name of the last park?
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.200]  That's going to be a short stream.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.700]  Well, we have the dark levels after that.
[01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.540]  Oh, God.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:44.960]  Excellent.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.220]  Thank you so much, everybody, for joining us.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.620]  This was Peek-a-Park 2.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.240]  What a time. We didn't kill each other.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.060]  That's great. Statistics got changed.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.900]  It'll be fun to see those when they eventually come out.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.920]  Make sure you check out our Patreon.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:01.920]  I'm sure some of you know that.
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:02.720]  We got a podcast.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.060]  We got a gameplay channel.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.940]  Have a great rest of your day.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.620]  Bye-bye.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.580]  Love you.
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.700]  Are you guys still there?
