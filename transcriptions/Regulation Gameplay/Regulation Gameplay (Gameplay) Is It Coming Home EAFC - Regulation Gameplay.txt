[00:00.000 --> 00:04.660]  Hello and welcome to another international battle of soccer, football,
[00:04.820 --> 00:06.460]  whatever the fuck you want to call it.
[00:06.560 --> 00:10.200]  We got it's coming home happening currently,
[00:10.980 --> 00:14.840]  and this game just got added a game pass, which is FC 24.
[00:15.460 --> 00:17.860]  You may remember a long time ago,
[00:18.240 --> 00:20.040]  I challenged Gavin to a game of cricket.
[00:20.140 --> 00:24.080]  Twenty three Nick spectated was our judge of sorts.
[00:24.540 --> 00:26.920]  And I wanted to extend the gauntlet.
[00:27.180 --> 00:29.820]  So I'd say this is even more of your your country's game.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.360]  Good old footy.
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.380]  This is the world's game.
[00:32.880 --> 00:35.160]  Oh, we're also recording this between the semifinal
[00:35.160 --> 00:37.920]  and the final of the twenty twenty four euros.
[00:37.980 --> 00:41.220]  So this this could maybe be like our Super Bowl prediction video.
[00:41.220 --> 00:44.920]  Yeah. Predicting the outcome to this game.
[00:45.020 --> 00:48.500]  But this video will absolutely not come out before the game.
[00:49.900 --> 00:50.640]  That's true.
[00:50.940 --> 00:54.840]  And to be honest, we were the idea was Canada versus England
[00:54.840 --> 00:56.020]  because we thought that would be funny.
[00:56.120 --> 00:58.340]  But why didn't you pick Canada, Andrew?
[00:58.340 --> 01:03.380]  Not in the game, not in Canada as a country.
[01:03.580 --> 01:05.300]  It's not in the fucking game.
[01:05.820 --> 01:07.300]  I almost was the white caps.
[01:07.420 --> 01:09.980]  But yeah, I mean, not a lot in soccer.
[01:10.100 --> 01:12.920]  We had a good run at the Copa America this year.
[01:12.980 --> 01:14.260]  You've got a player called Gavi.
[01:14.880 --> 01:16.980]  Oh, yeah, that's my secret rules.
[01:17.180 --> 01:17.540]  Oh, wow.
[01:17.740 --> 01:19.260]  I've got a girl. She's not even in.
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.140]  What was the last time you played like a FIFA game?
[01:21.380 --> 01:25.560]  I remember I had FIFA 97 on the N64.
[01:26.040 --> 01:26.400]  Beautiful.
[01:26.400 --> 01:28.460]  And I was a PS1 FIFA guy.
[01:28.720 --> 01:30.760]  The up C button was to foul people.
[01:31.140 --> 01:35.680]  And I had a lot of games end because there wasn't enough players left on the pitch.
[01:36.180 --> 01:36.980]  Oh, my God.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.040]  We had kids on the field.
[01:40.260 --> 01:41.400]  This game is getting serious.
[01:41.600 --> 01:44.800]  This game looks very good until they start showing the crowd
[01:44.800 --> 01:46.040]  and then it doesn't look very good anymore.
[01:46.140 --> 01:46.400]  Yes.
[01:46.920 --> 01:47.860]  Well, they're not focused on.
[01:48.120 --> 01:48.780]  Ball looks good.
[01:49.220 --> 01:50.520]  That's good. That's a central focus point.
[01:52.000 --> 01:52.480]  Weee!
[01:53.660 --> 01:56.240]  Not a sold out crowd today for this friendly.
[01:59.900 --> 02:00.740]  Oh, shit.
[02:01.220 --> 02:02.760]  OK, you're starting, I guess.
[02:03.280 --> 02:03.720]  All right.
[02:03.800 --> 02:05.860]  Just like we're going to have to figure out the buttons.
[02:06.420 --> 02:08.380]  We're figuring out the buttons on the fly, I guess.
[02:08.560 --> 02:09.180]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09.760 --> 02:10.420]  OK, good.
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.760]  Neither of you have touched this game previously.
[02:13.000 --> 02:13.800]  Yeah. How do I sprint?
[02:14.420 --> 02:17.220]  I played briefly less than a game.
[02:17.480 --> 02:17.980]  Right trigger.
[02:18.240 --> 02:18.660]  Right trigger.
[02:18.800 --> 02:19.020]  It's Richard.
[02:19.260 --> 02:19.780]  Get out of here.
[02:19.940 --> 02:20.420]  Get out of here.
[02:20.640 --> 02:20.940]  Get away.
[02:21.080 --> 02:21.640]  Get away from the go.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.660]  Oh, no.
[02:23.260 --> 02:24.140]  What a shot.
[02:24.140 --> 02:25.140]  What a Luna!
[02:26.020 --> 02:27.560]  To the moon from Gavin.
[02:28.100 --> 02:28.400]  Whoo!
[02:29.400 --> 02:30.000]  Too much mustard.
[02:30.620 --> 02:31.780]  How do you hit hard?
[02:31.980 --> 02:32.660]  What am I doing?
[02:32.960 --> 02:33.680]  Probably pressure.
[02:34.040 --> 02:34.680]  Nice chip.
[02:35.720 --> 02:36.260]  OK.
[02:37.920 --> 02:39.060]  Oh, get away from my ball.
[02:39.400 --> 02:40.640]  Get away from my ball.
[02:41.580 --> 02:46.360]  Asensio moving through midfield into the unfriendly third.
[02:46.580 --> 02:47.480]  Oh, no.
[02:47.840 --> 02:49.460]  With the strike, moving to the ball!
[02:50.860 --> 02:51.960]  Over the net.
[02:52.780 --> 02:54.620]  OK, so it's B's shoot.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.520]  B seems to be hit it over the bar.
[02:56.800 --> 02:56.980]  Yes.
[02:57.140 --> 02:58.820]  Left bumpers change guy.
[02:59.800 --> 03:00.200]  Hoof.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.460]  Oh, shit. That was not exactly what it gives me.
[03:02.620 --> 03:03.480]  I want it on it.
[03:03.600 --> 03:04.340]  Hits it to Rice.
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.140]  Rice, the midfielder, did you spelling break off?
[03:07.160 --> 03:07.660]  Let's go.
[03:07.920 --> 03:08.700]  Bellingham pressing.
[03:09.000 --> 03:09.860]  Oh, yeah.
[03:10.280 --> 03:12.080]  No penalty in the middle.
[03:12.640 --> 03:13.580]  How did you do that?
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.400]  How did you tackle me?
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.460]  I just ran into it.
[03:16.500 --> 03:17.240]  I just ran into it.
[03:17.280 --> 03:18.700]  Oh, Gavin, you had your chance.
[03:19.420 --> 03:20.160]  Left bumper to change.
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.160]  Oh, what a save by Pickford.
[03:25.320 --> 03:25.920]  Hoof.
[03:26.820 --> 03:27.940]  I want it.
[03:28.080 --> 03:28.620]  Out to midfield.
[03:28.860 --> 03:32.460]  Gavin with Shaw moving into the middle.
[03:32.840 --> 03:33.760]  Third passing forward.
[03:33.860 --> 03:35.580]  Oh, lost control of the ball.
[03:37.320 --> 03:39.660]  Oh, we're stealing it back and forth.
[03:39.940 --> 03:41.220]  Why do I pause so stupid?
[03:42.360 --> 03:42.900]  I don't know.
[03:43.260 --> 03:43.920]  Why do you do that?
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.580]  Oh, fuck.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.780]  Nice. Nice midfield pass there.
[03:48.100 --> 03:49.500]  Oh, extra slide.
[03:50.780 --> 03:51.740]  Extra slide, eh?
[03:52.820 --> 03:53.260]  Extra slide.
[03:53.620 --> 03:54.680]  You got to pick a different guy, Gavin.
[03:55.220 --> 03:55.480]  Oops.
[03:56.900 --> 03:59.000]  Yeah, but why is a used weapon?
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.160]  Oh, oh, what happened?
[04:01.380 --> 04:01.740]  Oh, wow.
[04:01.960 --> 04:02.280]  Oh, it's a corner kick.
[04:05.100 --> 04:05.580]  Lobbing.
[04:05.880 --> 04:06.880]  All right, don't blow this.
[04:07.160 --> 04:08.600]  Oh, too much mustard.
[04:09.020 --> 04:09.240]  Hitter.
[04:09.540 --> 04:12.220]  The first pass of the game and it is a score.
[04:12.820 --> 04:13.700]  It's in the goal.
[04:13.880 --> 04:15.120]  Bull fricking shit ass.
[04:15.600 --> 04:17.100]  Andrew, can I ask you a question?
[04:17.800 --> 04:18.060]  Yeah.
[04:18.060 --> 04:23.740]  Are you on the ground in your bedroom on your knees with your shirt over your head right now?
[04:23.760 --> 04:24.500]  Oh, I absolutely am.
[04:24.580 --> 04:27.400]  Yeah, I thought I'm waving my Spanish flag right now.
[04:27.480 --> 04:27.900]  Hell yeah.
[04:29.160 --> 04:36.460]  Electric score in the 12th minute as England will have possession now taking it out of the middle.
[04:37.040 --> 04:39.260]  Oh, it's like watching wrestling again
[04:40.140 --> 04:41.340]  with it, with Eric.
[04:41.340 --> 04:44.440]  Oh, no one is moving in.
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.820]  McGuire now with full control, moving into the center third, staying on side.
[04:49.940 --> 04:51.120]  Here's the ball is picked.
[04:51.900 --> 04:53.500]  Asensio moving through.
[04:54.100 --> 04:55.060]  No. Oh, Gav.
[04:56.280 --> 04:57.440]  Eric, you're good at play-by-play.
[04:57.920 --> 05:01.640]  It's you just have to look at the name and where they're going.
[05:02.700 --> 05:04.700]  Oh, I came first to the middle.
[05:04.960 --> 05:06.440]  Oh, no one's on here.
[05:06.780 --> 05:08.000]  Making a break.
[05:08.100 --> 05:08.920]  The counter.
[05:09.780 --> 05:11.200]  Oh, that's the outside.
[05:12.160 --> 05:13.720]  You lost connection to your opponent.
[05:13.840 --> 05:15.600]  We'll check the match report to see who won.
[05:15.720 --> 05:16.520]  No way.
[05:20.720 --> 05:24.400]  Oh, Gavin, you had the run of a lifetime.
[05:25.240 --> 05:26.700]  A week. All right.
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.740]  We got it. So now the real game starts.
[05:37.080 --> 05:39.120]  You ever finish Still Wakes the Deep, Geoff?
[05:39.380 --> 05:41.060]  Yeah, I beat the shit out of it.
[05:42.780 --> 05:44.340]  I fucked that thing up.
[05:45.280 --> 05:47.520]  I let that match kaboom.
[05:47.620 --> 05:48.660]  Bye bye, aliens.
[05:48.900 --> 05:49.900]  You bend that game over.
[05:50.240 --> 05:50.640]  Yeah.
[05:51.340 --> 05:52.900]  Andrew, Andrew, I got an update.
[05:53.360 --> 05:54.300]  Andrew, I got an update.
[05:54.600 --> 05:55.600]  Oh, what's the update?
[05:55.940 --> 05:58.560]  You will have your puzzle this Friday between one and five.
[05:59.800 --> 06:00.980]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:01.380 --> 06:03.800]  Has anybody has Gavin turned in puzzle times yet?
[06:03.960 --> 06:04.780]  No, no one has.
[06:05.340 --> 06:07.400]  OK, can I express a fear with you all?
[06:07.520 --> 06:09.640]  What the fuck is going on?
[06:09.880 --> 06:11.360]  God, I have this here.
[06:11.740 --> 06:12.940]  Wait, Geoff, hang on.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.740]  Geoff, shut the fuck up.
[06:14.740 --> 06:19.140]  We've been joined for some reason by Gracie.
[06:19.320 --> 06:20.500]  What are you doing?
[06:23.220 --> 06:24.000]  She muted!
[06:24.180 --> 06:24.980]  She muted!
[06:25.280 --> 06:25.520]  She muted!
[06:26.140 --> 06:27.320]  I thought I was already on mute.
[06:27.500 --> 06:27.680]  Hi.
[06:27.780 --> 06:29.160]  Are you watching the fight?
[06:29.420 --> 06:29.520]  Hi!
[06:30.100 --> 06:33.320]  I don't know, I just got a notification that y'all were here, so I thought I should say hi.
[06:33.760 --> 06:34.700]  Oh, wow!
[06:35.440 --> 06:37.420]  Holy shit, a drive by Gracie.
[06:37.620 --> 06:38.780]  Are you in a different state?
[06:39.360 --> 06:39.500]  Insane.
[06:39.760 --> 06:41.000]  No, I'm in my apartment.
[06:41.560 --> 06:42.280]  Oh, shit.
[06:42.740 --> 06:43.720]  What's your tub time?
[06:43.720 --> 06:44.040]  You got it?
[06:45.080 --> 06:45.920]  What's my what?
[06:46.220 --> 06:46.740]  Never mind.
[06:48.840 --> 06:52.000]  How does it feel to be a responsible, grown-up professional?
[06:52.900 --> 06:57.540]  Wait, that's funny you say that, because I'm not being that today at all.
[06:57.600 --> 06:59.340]  Oh, yeah, he's that right.
[07:01.040 --> 07:05.600]  I had to go run an errand for my boss this morning.
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.120]  I don't even know if I should say this on the internet.
[07:08.480 --> 07:10.920]  You probably shouldn't, because it is definitely on the internet.
[07:10.920 --> 07:15.880]  The place that I was at, they offered champagne, and I hadn't even brushed my teeth.
[07:16.020 --> 07:16.320]  Yeah!
[07:17.280 --> 07:18.560]  Hell yeah!
[07:19.540 --> 07:21.400]  You are definitely in Austin.
[07:22.560 --> 07:24.480]  Gracie, that's so cool.
[07:26.300 --> 07:27.620]  This is awesome.
[07:27.860 --> 07:28.320]  Now I'm here.
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.920]  I want to run an errand.
[07:31.160 --> 07:34.740]  England are currently playing Spain in this FIFA game.
[07:35.300 --> 07:36.900]  Here's where we are, Gracie.
[07:36.900 --> 07:42.020]  Andrew wanted to have Canada play England in FIFA, him versus Gavin.
[07:42.480 --> 07:45.240]  But they took his country out of the game.
[07:45.420 --> 07:46.040]  They're so useless.
[07:46.140 --> 07:50.580]  So he's playing as Spain instead, because of his deep Spanish roots.
[07:51.240 --> 07:54.500]  Oh, I didn't know that you had deep Spanish roots.
[07:54.600 --> 07:55.700]  I didn't either.
[07:56.520 --> 07:57.860]  I'm embracing it today.
[07:58.100 --> 07:59.520]  I'm happy we could all discover that together.
[07:59.840 --> 08:03.760]  Oh, and earlier, right before this, right before you came in,
[08:03.760 --> 08:07.600]  they started a different game, and Andrew scored on Gavin almost immediately,
[08:07.820 --> 08:10.220]  and then very conveniently, Gavin's game dropped.
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.860]  Oh, really, Gavin?
[08:13.140 --> 08:15.520]  It was my internet. No one to blame.
[08:17.780 --> 08:18.800]  He got back in the game.
[08:19.020 --> 08:19.680]  Oh, he's offside!
[08:19.820 --> 08:20.680]  No! No!
[08:22.060 --> 08:23.340]  It's gotta be offside.
[08:23.460 --> 08:25.280]  It's offside, though. It's gotta be offside.
[08:26.260 --> 08:26.920]  Yeah, offside.
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.020]  See, he just grabbed the ball.
[08:28.020 --> 08:29.460]  See, there you go.
[08:30.360 --> 08:34.280]  Gracie, while we have you probably for another couple minutes,
[08:34.820 --> 08:38.720]  how has it been? Have you missed this podcast at all?
[08:39.320 --> 08:42.220]  Yes, I have. That's why I wanted to come say hi,
[08:42.300 --> 08:44.280]  because I saw you all together without me.
[08:44.940 --> 08:46.400]  We miss you.
[08:46.700 --> 08:48.580]  Yeah, in that case, we missed you, too.
[08:49.680 --> 08:50.700]  You didn't prior.
[08:52.200 --> 08:55.960]  Now that we know that you missed us, we'll admit to missing you as well.
[08:56.140 --> 08:57.220]  Yeah, he was hedging bets.
[08:57.720 --> 08:58.720]  Otherwise, we didn't get a spot.
[08:58.820 --> 09:01.020]  The timing is so funny, because we did a sausage talk yesterday,
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.860]  and somebody asked, will there be Gracie content?
[09:03.060 --> 09:04.180]  And we're like, we hope soon.
[09:04.280 --> 09:04.700]  There should.
[09:04.920 --> 09:10.540]  Let's do like an evening event, like I did with 100% Eat.
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.540]  Yeah, but it'll be good.
[09:12.840 --> 09:14.120]  Yeah, okay, cool. Thanks, man.
[09:14.380 --> 09:16.620]  Hey, I had a lot of fun that night.
[09:16.640 --> 09:20.320]  Yeah, she ate a bunch of Garfield pasta. She had a great time.
[09:20.860 --> 09:22.740]  I did, and then Nick choked a couple times.
[09:23.120 --> 09:23.980]  Yeah, I choked.
[09:23.980 --> 09:24.860]  Oh, shit.
[09:25.160 --> 09:26.540]  Oh, Gavin, this might be it.
[09:26.640 --> 09:27.200]  Gavin, you gotta press.
[09:27.900 --> 09:29.100]  Gavin, bring it home, buddy.
[09:29.300 --> 09:31.100]  Oh, it's coming home, Gavin.
[09:31.260 --> 09:31.600]  Go!
[09:32.760 --> 09:33.520]  Oh, shit.
[09:33.720 --> 09:34.360]  Take it home.
[09:34.760 --> 09:35.600]  Get away, get away, get away.
[09:36.380 --> 09:36.780]  Stop.
[09:37.300 --> 09:38.180]  Oh, Gavin.
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.200]  You suck.
[09:39.440 --> 09:40.600]  You suck.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.480]  Why does it keep going so high?
[09:43.500 --> 09:44.080]  What am I doing?
[09:46.160 --> 09:47.840]  No, why do I keep doing that?
[09:47.840 --> 09:48.380]  Oh.
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.280]  I keep thinking the goal is 60 feet above the grass.
[09:56.120 --> 09:59.520]  Oh, Gracie, also, since we last hung out, Nick went insane.
[09:59.920 --> 10:00.140]  No!
[10:00.900 --> 10:01.680]  Wait, that's not new.
[10:01.700 --> 10:02.760]  Nick's been an insane person.
[10:03.240 --> 10:04.860]  But he's insane over here now, too.
[10:05.140 --> 10:05.500]  Oh, yeah.
[10:05.500 --> 10:05.920]  Wait, really?
[10:06.300 --> 10:06.900]  Oh, yeah.
[10:07.620 --> 10:08.660]  Why didn't we do that earlier?
[10:10.500 --> 10:11.620]  Why didn't we do that?
[10:11.820 --> 10:12.860]  Gavin uncorked him.
[10:13.100 --> 10:13.360]  Yeah.
[10:13.460 --> 10:14.720]  Yeah, I popped his cork out.
[10:14.720 --> 10:17.980]  Yeah, he's like listening to Gavin's suggestions.
[10:18.140 --> 10:19.100]  It's not good.
[10:19.860 --> 10:20.440]  No, it was great.
[10:20.580 --> 10:21.000]  Can I get an example?
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.860]  Yeah, we were playing a heist in Grand Theft Auto.
[10:26.260 --> 10:29.240]  We almost beat it on the first try.
[10:29.580 --> 10:31.980]  Gavin whispered in his ear like a siren.
[10:32.480 --> 10:34.500]  And then Nick listened to him.
[10:34.940 --> 10:37.900]  And we had to spend another hour and a half playing the game.
[10:38.740 --> 10:39.400]  I'm helping.
[10:39.980 --> 10:43.200]  Oh, shit, I got in my own way.
[10:43.640 --> 10:44.040]  Yeah!
[10:45.400 --> 10:45.740]  Bah!
[10:47.120 --> 10:47.520]  Bah!
[10:48.200 --> 10:48.840]  Fuck you!
[10:49.000 --> 10:49.800]  I just woke up!
[10:49.960 --> 10:50.300]  I was sweating!
[10:50.520 --> 10:51.360]  I didn't even play the whole game!
[10:51.380 --> 10:53.780]  Open your frickin' eyes, ref, you silly bastard!
[10:54.060 --> 10:55.460]  Oh, I just kicked you in the balls!
[10:55.580 --> 10:56.180]  Oh, there it is.
[10:56.360 --> 10:57.740]  You might have been offside for that.
[10:58.960 --> 11:00.220]  Trip, trip, trip!
[11:00.440 --> 11:01.140]  What was that?
[11:01.380 --> 11:01.560]  Oh.
[11:02.480 --> 11:03.340]  Oh, God!
[11:04.900 --> 11:06.660]  I kind of went over the buttons.
[11:07.060 --> 11:08.020]  The shitting buttons.
[11:08.240 --> 11:10.000]  Andrew, how do you kick it in the frickin' goal?
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.180]  Gavin, did you customize it?
[11:13.180 --> 11:14.740]  Is that what they gave you?
[11:15.620 --> 11:16.840]  This is the England kit.
[11:17.160 --> 11:18.020]  Yeah, it's just the white.
[11:18.220 --> 11:19.760]  Gracie, are you not watching the Euros?
[11:20.200 --> 11:20.780]  Oh, shit!
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.480]  No, Gracie's a Copa.
[11:22.800 --> 11:23.340]  America's kind of...
[11:24.460 --> 11:26.120]  I don't watch soccer at all.
[11:26.900 --> 11:28.040]  It's the best sport in the world.
[11:29.020 --> 11:29.560]  According to Gavin.
[11:31.340 --> 11:31.880]  Oh, God.
[11:32.300 --> 11:32.960]  Oh, no!
[11:33.740 --> 11:35.620]  Oh, this is a strong push!
[11:35.800 --> 11:36.060]  It's coming in!
[11:36.980 --> 11:38.240]  Oh, what a move!
[11:38.960 --> 11:40.340]  Did we all still root against Gavin?
[11:40.860 --> 11:41.320]  Oh, yeah.
[11:41.440 --> 11:41.900]  What do you mean?
[11:43.580 --> 11:44.560]  Come on, Andrew.
[11:45.620 --> 11:47.140]  That's not a good thing that we should do.
[11:47.500 --> 11:51.460]  I mean, the hard part with rooting against Gavin in this is that I have to root for Andrew.
[11:51.700 --> 11:53.180]  And I just don't know that I have that chance.
[11:53.180 --> 11:54.400]  I don't see anything wrong with that.
[11:54.400 --> 11:55.260]  There's no winning there.
[11:55.520 --> 11:59.300]  The nice thing about rooting for Andrew is he's a sore winner.
[11:59.560 --> 12:00.320]  And I love that.
[12:02.360 --> 12:05.940]  Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
[12:05.940 --> 12:06.360]  What are you doing?
[12:06.520 --> 12:07.560]  Turn on the jets!
[12:07.960 --> 12:08.960]  Turn on the jets!
[12:09.780 --> 12:12.200]  You should have just lobbed it in!
[12:12.200 --> 12:13.700]  He was coming out of the net!
[12:14.020 --> 12:15.080]  That was pathetic!
[12:16.680 --> 12:18.320]  He was coming out of the net!
[12:18.440 --> 12:19.320]  I'm back in! I'm back in!
[12:19.360 --> 12:20.400]  Go on, press!
[12:21.660 --> 12:23.260]  No, corner kick. I can hit it again.
[12:23.720 --> 12:24.380]  Header coming in.
[12:24.880 --> 12:25.160]  Alright.
[12:25.300 --> 12:25.620]  Here we go.
[12:25.760 --> 12:27.740]  Here's the header in the tutorial game.
[12:27.880 --> 12:28.940]  We saw the header work.
[12:29.640 --> 12:30.340]  Go! Go!
[12:30.820 --> 12:31.820]  Doesn't work here!
[12:32.980 --> 12:33.540]  Come back in!
[12:33.680 --> 12:34.120]  Come back in!
[12:34.280 --> 12:34.660]  30 yards!
[12:36.960 --> 12:37.940]  Header from the other side!
[12:38.260 --> 12:38.520]  No!
[12:38.640 --> 12:38.920]  Smart.
[12:39.340 --> 12:41.740]  Gavin clearing the ball to midfield.
[12:41.740 --> 12:43.200]  Now just a throw in.
[12:43.900 --> 12:46.620]  Gavin's balls are sweaty right now.
[12:48.160 --> 12:50.960]  Gavin not controlling anyone near the net.
[12:51.440 --> 12:53.320]  How do you... Andrew?
[12:54.140 --> 12:54.960]  I'm just tapping it.
[12:55.080 --> 12:55.900]  I'm just tapping it.
[12:55.900 --> 12:56.600]  What are the buttons?
[12:57.160 --> 12:58.120]  What are the buttons here?
[12:58.120 --> 12:58.740]  I'm just tapping it.
[12:59.060 --> 12:59.700]  You're winning!
[12:59.900 --> 13:00.900]  Why are you asking me?
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.280]  What do you mean I'm winning?
[13:02.840 --> 13:03.820]  Oh, I thought you scored.
[13:04.020 --> 13:04.660]  Oh, there's all sides.
[13:05.260 --> 13:06.240]  I was sweating.
[13:06.580 --> 13:07.820]  I forgot that that wasn't allowed.
[13:08.200 --> 13:08.800]  Oh, man.
[13:08.980 --> 13:11.320]  I think, Gavin, I have a feeling.
[13:11.320 --> 13:12.920]  I haven't looked it up.
[13:12.920 --> 13:16.580]  Just knowing how complicated this game is.
[13:16.720 --> 13:21.880]  I bet for shooting, it needs to be a button that you're holding plus the shoot button.
[13:22.860 --> 13:23.900]  To, like, not...
[13:23.900 --> 13:25.000]  I just have been tapping B.
[13:25.220 --> 13:30.140]  I have a feeling it's, like, hold left bumper or hold right trigger or something.
[13:30.260 --> 13:32.120]  Or it might be a direction in B.
[13:32.120 --> 13:32.460]  Uh-oh!
[13:32.600 --> 13:34.300]  To aim the ball.
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.100]  Because you guys are putting it over, and I have a feeling that it's because the button by itself is a different kind of shot.
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.880]  That just sounds like something that would be in the shitty game.
[13:44.240 --> 13:46.480]  Let me in. I want the ball. Let me get the ball.
[13:48.180 --> 13:52.360]  Remember when EA owned all of gaming for a couple years there?
[13:52.820 --> 13:54.120]  Well, it was in the game.
[13:54.380 --> 13:54.540]  Yeah.
[13:54.720 --> 13:55.220]  That's true.
[13:55.500 --> 13:59.420]  I think FIFA is trying to pair with 2K now to make a new FIFA.
[14:00.040 --> 14:01.020]  Oh, you're through.
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.640]  I have so many shots and just none of them in.
[14:04.660 --> 14:04.860]  Yeah.
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.020]  Okay, I gotta go now.
[14:07.280 --> 14:09.340]  Okay, Gracie, it was nice talking to you.
[14:09.780 --> 14:10.900]  Bye, guys.
[14:11.360 --> 14:12.700]  Bye, Gracie. Come back soon.
[14:13.240 --> 14:14.220]  Bye, Gracie.
[14:15.740 --> 14:16.740]  That was awesome.
[14:16.900 --> 14:17.900]  That was so funny.
[14:18.260 --> 14:19.660]  Having Gracie come in is so crazy.
[14:19.660 --> 14:20.500]  Just a drive by Gracie.
[14:20.580 --> 14:20.760]  Yeah.
[14:20.840 --> 14:21.080]  Wow.
[14:21.100 --> 14:22.460]  We need to play more sports games.
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.620]  Yeah, it is.
[14:23.860 --> 14:24.660]  That's where we get Gracie.
[14:24.660 --> 14:26.120]  We got Master Rob last time.
[14:26.160 --> 14:26.480]  Alright.
[14:26.620 --> 14:28.020]  Then we get Gracie this time.
[14:28.320 --> 14:29.120]  Oh, man.
[14:29.820 --> 14:30.560]  Are we at the half?
[14:30.620 --> 14:30.780]  Yeah.
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.180]  Oh, shit.
[14:32.180 --> 14:34.400]  You guys had Master Rob when you played the cricket game?
[14:35.120 --> 14:35.480]  Well, no.
[14:35.560 --> 14:36.800]  When we did Madden.
[14:36.840 --> 14:37.720]  Oh, right.
[14:37.800 --> 14:38.500]  That's what you're saying, yeah.
[14:38.500 --> 14:39.880]  They had me for the cricket game.
[14:41.260 --> 14:42.400]  You guys had Nick?
[14:42.820 --> 14:43.100]  Yeah.
[14:43.300 --> 14:43.540]  Yeah.
[14:43.780 --> 14:44.560]  Crazy guy Nick.
[14:45.020 --> 14:46.260]  You had pre-crazy Nick?
[14:46.540 --> 14:46.820]  Yeah.
[14:48.160 --> 14:48.760]  Alright, Gavin.
[14:48.940 --> 14:49.420]  Alright, Gavin.
[14:49.980 --> 14:51.460]  It's time to make your move.
[14:51.820 --> 14:53.060]  Get Jude Bellingham up.
[14:53.460 --> 14:55.100]  You need Harry Kane to strike now.
[14:56.220 --> 14:57.920]  You need to hit left bumper switch.
[14:58.960 --> 15:01.020]  Oh, he's getting tricky here.
[15:01.480 --> 15:02.740]  What a shot!
[15:03.120 --> 15:05.080]  I was switching to all the wrong people.
[15:05.660 --> 15:07.160]  It looked like a good shot, though, Gav.
[15:07.160 --> 15:10.320]  And it looked like maybe you found another gear.
[15:10.540 --> 15:10.860]  The log.
[15:11.300 --> 15:11.660]  No.
[15:11.760 --> 15:12.980]  No one there in the header.
[15:13.280 --> 15:14.080]  You need to clear it!
[15:14.520 --> 15:15.360]  Get it out of the box, you nuts!
[15:15.360 --> 15:16.000]  What are you doing?
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.620]  What the hell's going on?
[15:18.420 --> 15:19.420]  You'll see soon enough.
[15:20.080 --> 15:20.500]  Okay.
[15:21.160 --> 15:22.120]  Oh, no!
[15:26.200 --> 15:28.060]  What is wrong with your connection?
[15:29.120 --> 15:30.400]  Hey, what's wrong with this game?
[15:31.280 --> 15:33.580]  You're the one, you're internet, you're blue screened.
[15:34.460 --> 15:35.680]  I reset everything.
[15:35.780 --> 15:36.720]  Moist stuff's good again.
[15:37.300 --> 15:38.720]  Alright, let's start again.
[15:38.780 --> 15:39.240]  Not everything.
[15:41.400 --> 15:42.800]  One more time!
[15:43.120 --> 15:44.220]  One more time!
[15:44.680 --> 15:46.460]  We'll play until we get a full game.
[15:46.640 --> 15:46.840]  Yep.
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.820]  Oh, I've got new contact preferences to accept.
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.780]  You piece of shit turd.
[15:59.460 --> 16:01.520]  You fucking piece of shit turd.
[16:06.240 --> 16:08.420]  Do we want to just do the first half of this?
[16:08.540 --> 16:08.960]  No!
[16:09.460 --> 16:09.900]  No, wait!
[16:09.900 --> 16:11.360]  No, we need one full game.
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.960]  Don't try to weasel out of this, you little sneak.
[16:14.280 --> 16:15.280]  You little sneak.
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.040]  Fucking bullshit.
[16:18.700 --> 16:19.760]  Why is that a weasel?
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.300]  I'm not saying I'm going to win.
[16:23.380 --> 16:24.180]  Power shot.
[16:24.240 --> 16:25.160]  There's no advantage.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.880]  Left bumper, right bumper, B.
[16:27.220 --> 16:27.720]  Finesse shot.
[16:27.840 --> 16:28.280]  I was right!
[16:28.540 --> 16:29.500]  There's combos.
[16:29.900 --> 16:30.600]  So I was right!
[16:30.720 --> 16:32.340]  You have to hit other buttons in the shoot button.
[16:32.620 --> 16:33.480]  This game sucks.
[16:33.820 --> 16:35.000]  This game fucking sucks.
[16:35.320 --> 16:37.140]  On the N64, you would just hit B.
[16:37.340 --> 16:37.600]  Yes.
[16:37.600 --> 16:41.760]  These games, they all look great, and they're no fun.
[16:44.700 --> 16:46.140]  You're right about that, Eric.
[16:46.560 --> 16:47.600]  I've been saying that.
[16:47.840 --> 16:54.800]  So, it happened a lot with pro wrestling games, where they look so realistic, and then for
[16:54.800 --> 16:57.080]  over a decade, unplayable.
[16:57.420 --> 17:01.560]  Just like, not fun at all, but it was like watching TV.
[17:02.060 --> 17:03.240]  So it was like, that was cool.
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.740]  But then another, this AEW game came out, it was fun, and then the WWE game decided
[17:08.740 --> 17:09.820]  it had to be fun too.
[17:10.060 --> 17:11.540]  So they rebuilt it from the ground up.
[17:11.740 --> 17:16.720]  I will say, I've enjoyed MLB The Show, although I got bored with it before too long.
[17:18.020 --> 17:19.160]  That one was okay.
[17:19.560 --> 17:23.920]  But I'm going to play the shit out of NBA 2K this year, just because Jason Tatum's on
[17:23.920 --> 17:26.280]  the cover, and it'll be like a Celtics-heavy edition.
[17:26.660 --> 17:28.060]  But I know it's going to suck.
[17:28.060 --> 17:29.840]  What is going on?
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.240]  Why did the goalie come so far out of the net?
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.000]  No one home.
[17:35.820 --> 17:37.620]  Who could have seen that coming?
[17:38.560 --> 17:46.220]  Countdown to Gotham's internet dying in 5, 4, 3...
[17:47.500 --> 17:48.900]  Hyper motion technology, huh?
[17:49.160 --> 17:55.500]  How will Harry Kane and the lads answer back in just the fourth minute?
[17:55.500 --> 17:57.660]  Being down 1-0.
[17:59.180 --> 18:04.120]  In the Netherlands game, they struck early, I believe, and England had to respond.
[18:04.500 --> 18:07.460]  And the response, it will be here, Geoff.
[18:07.580 --> 18:13.800]  We will see the mystifying extra gear that England has touted through this whole tournament.
[18:15.060 --> 18:15.700]  Oh, shit.
[18:16.860 --> 18:17.820]  Stones to Grealish.
[18:17.920 --> 18:19.080]  Let's get it away, let's get it away.
[18:19.120 --> 18:19.620]  How do I cross?
[18:19.720 --> 18:20.500]  How do I cross over to this?
[18:20.600 --> 18:20.740]  Okay.
[18:21.560 --> 18:22.240]  Grealish press.
[18:22.520 --> 18:24.660]  Press through the middle into the opposing third.
[18:25.360 --> 18:26.460]  Onside to Kane.
[18:26.660 --> 18:27.360]  Kane through the middle.
[18:27.640 --> 18:28.560]  Kane moving up.
[18:28.800 --> 18:29.240]  Oh!
[18:31.020 --> 18:31.980]  Too high.
[18:32.320 --> 18:35.520]  No finesse on the shot from Harry Kane.
[18:35.940 --> 18:36.540]  The hero.
[18:36.860 --> 18:37.000]  Everybody out.
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.520]  Everybody get deeper.
[18:38.860 --> 18:39.720]  Get deeper, everyone.
[18:39.960 --> 18:43.660]  No excuse from Gavin because he looked at the controls between the matches.
[18:44.140 --> 18:45.640]  That's true, I had a little gander.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.120]  Was that a finesse shot or a power shot?
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.160]  That was an X shot, whatever that means.
[18:51.160 --> 18:52.580]  Or was that a panic shot?
[18:52.640 --> 18:54.020]  Oh, look at the movement.
[18:54.020 --> 18:56.320]  The ball through the third.
[18:56.360 --> 18:56.800]  Oh!
[18:57.640 --> 18:57.940]  Oh!
[18:58.840 --> 18:59.280]  Recovering.
[18:59.440 --> 18:59.780]  Oh, look at this!
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.560]  Shot at Kane.
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.280]  Kane to the middle.
[19:01.380 --> 19:01.980]  Take the shot!
[19:02.140 --> 19:04.380]  Oh, no one there to take the shot.
[19:04.540 --> 19:06.520]  Lost in the box like schoolboys.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.460]  Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[19:08.520 --> 19:10.280]  You know, it's a thing of beauty until it isn't.
[19:10.580 --> 19:10.900]  Yeah.
[19:11.340 --> 19:14.420]  Oh, oh, has to be offside on this push.
[19:14.860 --> 19:17.480]  A little too far up was Spain.
[19:18.320 --> 19:18.760]  Damn.
[19:18.800 --> 19:19.140]  Fuck.
[19:20.280 --> 19:20.900]  I had an angle.
[19:22.420 --> 19:22.720]  Woo!
[19:22.720 --> 19:24.360]  England with possession.
[19:24.660 --> 19:27.260]  Now, the 13th minute ticking away.
[19:27.440 --> 19:28.460]  How are those balls feeling, Gav?
[19:28.540 --> 19:29.000]  What was that?
[19:29.760 --> 19:30.480]  Who was that to?
[19:31.400 --> 19:32.920]  That was my goalie, apparently.
[19:34.780 --> 19:35.700]  Lovely stuff.
[19:35.860 --> 19:36.460]  Lovely stuff.
[19:37.020 --> 19:37.720]  Oh, come on.
[19:38.300 --> 19:39.240]  Oh, Spain.
[19:39.520 --> 19:40.940]  Spain could not keep control.
[19:41.080 --> 19:43.800]  And it is a fight in this middle third here today.
[19:44.560 --> 19:45.960]  Oh, look at this.
[19:46.060 --> 19:46.480]  Morata.
[19:46.820 --> 19:48.420]  Morata all alone.
[19:49.000 --> 19:49.440]  Oh!
[19:49.440 --> 19:55.300]  What a block from Pickford, but now another corner.
[19:58.460 --> 20:01.340]  Looking for just a little chip.
[20:01.800 --> 20:02.580]  No one there.
[20:02.820 --> 20:03.500]  Booted out.
[20:03.920 --> 20:04.560]  Oh, my God.
[20:04.580 --> 20:06.220]  What a clearance there.
[20:06.780 --> 20:08.260]  Go, go, go, go.
[20:08.260 --> 20:09.580]  And the goalie is way out here.
[20:10.220 --> 20:12.440]  The goalie right out of the net.
[20:12.460 --> 20:14.280]  Holy shit, Gavin.
[20:15.020 --> 20:17.140]  England did not capitalize.
[20:18.820 --> 20:21.720]  An embarrassment to the whole nation.
[20:22.100 --> 20:22.380]  Shit.
[20:22.700 --> 20:26.040]  Spain pulled the goalie in the 19th minute.
[20:27.280 --> 20:28.480]  Questionable decision.
[20:28.980 --> 20:29.600]  Come on.
[20:29.900 --> 20:30.500]  Laporta.
[20:31.060 --> 20:32.020]  I suck.
[20:32.840 --> 20:33.160]  I suck.
[20:36.890 --> 20:38.050]  Missing another shot.
[20:38.170 --> 20:39.930]  Not even on goal, that one.
[20:40.130 --> 20:41.470]  Wow, how is that not a handball?
[20:42.330 --> 20:48.230]  Oh, look at this movement.
[20:48.510 --> 20:49.070]  Come on.
[20:49.070 --> 20:50.310]  How impressed is England?
[20:50.630 --> 20:52.290]  No one home on that slide tackle.
[20:52.490 --> 20:53.610]  Oh, what a block.
[20:54.350 --> 20:58.130]  Just getting a ball in the way as Grealish has possession.
[20:59.150 --> 21:00.130]  Crossing to Kane.
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.550]  Go, go, go, go.
[21:01.550 --> 21:02.990]  Kane can't control it.
[21:03.350 --> 21:05.310]  Squirrely the England boys today.
[21:06.530 --> 21:06.870]  No penalties.
[21:06.870 --> 21:07.830]  How is that not a penalty?
[21:08.330 --> 21:09.830]  Do you guys have penalties turned off?
[21:10.130 --> 21:10.810]  Here we go.
[21:10.810 --> 21:11.910]  Kane all alone.
[21:12.250 --> 21:13.250]  Kane all alone.
[21:13.490 --> 21:14.710]  Him and the goalie.
[21:15.330 --> 21:16.130]  Harry Kane!
[21:16.130 --> 21:16.630]  Oh!
[21:16.770 --> 21:17.310]  Shot!
[21:17.310 --> 21:17.350]  Shot!
[21:18.750 --> 21:19.710]  I suck!
[21:24.180 --> 21:25.360]  Go, go!
[21:25.480 --> 21:26.260]  Give me that ball!
[21:26.680 --> 21:26.940]  No!
[21:27.300 --> 21:27.660]  Onside!
[21:27.820 --> 21:28.360]  Oh, wow.
[21:29.080 --> 21:31.260]  Pigford way up out of the box there.
[21:31.920 --> 21:33.500]  Oh my God!
[21:34.560 --> 21:35.460]  Attack it head on.
[21:35.840 --> 21:36.560]  Attack the problem.
[21:36.760 --> 21:36.780]  No!
[21:40.320 --> 21:42.260]  Attack it head on!
[21:42.640 --> 21:43.220]  What?
[21:43.740 --> 21:44.660]  That's a...
[21:44.660 --> 21:45.440]  Wait, no.
[21:45.820 --> 21:47.040]  The referee...
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.360]  What?
[21:47.720 --> 21:48.600]  A warning.
[21:48.600 --> 21:53.140]  A warning from the referee as England takes control in the midfield.
[21:55.920 --> 21:57.280]  Slight tackle pass.
[21:59.560 --> 22:01.840]  Oh, for God's sake.
[22:02.040 --> 22:02.840]  Let me shoot!
[22:03.340 --> 22:03.660]  Get it out!
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.260]  Let me shoot!
[22:04.760 --> 22:05.180]  Get it out!
[22:05.280 --> 22:05.720]  Get it out!
[22:06.460 --> 22:07.400]  A lot of movement.
[22:07.420 --> 22:08.280]  Oh, there you go, Gavin!
[22:08.580 --> 22:09.020]  Midfield.
[22:09.460 --> 22:10.440]  England with the ball.
[22:10.560 --> 22:10.960]  Harry Kane!
[22:11.100 --> 22:11.660]  Another shot!
[22:11.940 --> 22:12.460]  No!
[22:15.500 --> 22:17.620]  Harry Kane has done it!
[22:17.620 --> 22:19.560]  The equalizer!
[22:21.900 --> 22:24.500]  Oh my Lord.
[22:24.860 --> 22:26.400]  Oh, what a shot.
[22:27.660 --> 22:27.900]  Kane!
[22:27.900 --> 22:31.840]  Harry Kane says, fuck me lads, it's coming home.
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.600]  How does that feel, Gavin?
[22:37.140 --> 22:38.800]  That felt real.
[22:40.220 --> 22:41.980]  Cross, cross, cross.
[22:44.860 --> 22:46.820]  Oh, Pigford way up...
[22:47.980 --> 22:50.840]  That was the goalie so far out of the net!
[22:51.540 --> 22:52.200]  Gavin.
[22:52.920 --> 22:53.420]  Gavin.
[22:53.780 --> 22:55.260]  I wanted Pigford to come home.
[22:55.300 --> 22:55.560]  Why?
[22:55.780 --> 22:55.940]  Why?
[22:56.580 --> 22:57.860]  That was unfortunate.
[22:58.340 --> 23:00.620]  The equalizer immediately wasted.
[23:01.040 --> 23:02.360]  How does that feel, Andrew?
[23:03.460 --> 23:05.640]  Fucking, it's coming home!
[23:08.900 --> 23:10.420]  It's coming home to Barcelona.
[23:11.220 --> 23:11.440]  Yep.
[23:11.900 --> 23:13.600]  Grealish alone in the corner.
[23:14.380 --> 23:15.060]  Crossing nobody there.
[23:15.060 --> 23:16.320]  Where was everyone else, son?
[23:16.320 --> 23:17.420]  What are they doing?
[23:17.580 --> 23:19.080]  La Normande in defense.
[23:19.340 --> 23:20.100]  They're tired.
[23:20.340 --> 23:21.460]  Lob pass to the middle.
[23:21.820 --> 23:22.920]  Back to Grealish.
[23:23.040 --> 23:23.940]  Oh, Navas.
[23:25.380 --> 23:26.860]  Navas clearing the ball.
[23:27.160 --> 23:28.900]  Pigford up to stop it.
[23:29.560 --> 23:30.500]  Passing to Stone.
[23:30.640 --> 23:31.560]  Stones to Maguire.
[23:31.660 --> 23:32.440]  Maguire to Shaw.
[23:32.560 --> 23:33.780]  Moving through the middle third.
[23:33.980 --> 23:34.600]  See, this is easy.
[23:34.720 --> 23:36.180]  You just look at the name and you say the thing.
[23:36.580 --> 23:37.380]  I gotcha.
[23:38.160 --> 23:39.340]  Oh, look at this!
[23:39.800 --> 23:41.480]  Look at Saka, the hero!
[23:41.720 --> 23:42.060]  No!
[23:42.680 --> 23:43.200]  Had it!
[23:43.800 --> 23:44.060]  What?
[23:44.200 --> 23:45.120]  Oh, fuck.
[23:47.480 --> 23:48.540]  But you know all these...
[23:48.540 --> 23:49.020]  Why do we want this?
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.120]  You know all these soccer terms.
[23:52.020 --> 23:52.760]  Like the middle?
[23:53.080 --> 23:53.560]  The third?
[23:54.220 --> 23:54.700]  The corner?
[23:54.820 --> 23:59.860]  Well, yeah, just split it into thirds and then look at if they're in their opposing third, their own third, or the middle.
[24:00.260 --> 24:02.700]  What was the worst corner of the world?
[24:02.700 --> 24:04.180]  An embarrassment from England.
[24:04.180 --> 24:07.520]  Stop trying to bog him down with all your industry jargon.
[24:07.740 --> 24:08.000]  Yeah.
[24:08.840 --> 24:09.200]  Shit!
[24:09.420 --> 24:10.220]  See, Nick, it's easy.
[24:11.720 --> 24:12.120]  Offsides?
[24:12.220 --> 24:13.040]  What the hell is that?
[24:13.040 --> 24:16.860]  He's too far up in front of the previous most defended.
[24:18.840 --> 24:20.480]  Seems like that's just good offense.
[24:21.820 --> 24:23.320]  Well, they say the best offense...
[24:24.940 --> 24:25.520]  Is it good offense?
[24:25.640 --> 24:25.940]  Shit!
[24:26.740 --> 24:27.180]  Yeah, I don't know.
[24:27.320 --> 24:28.140]  I didn't...
[24:28.140 --> 24:28.320]  No!
[24:31.240 --> 24:32.420]  Oh my God!
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.980]  First off, number four coming up.
[24:35.800 --> 24:36.480]  This sucks.
[24:37.060 --> 24:38.080]  What a fucking...
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.060]  They're starting to fee for the movie.
[24:40.960 --> 24:41.520]  How?
[24:41.720 --> 24:42.200]  Why?
[24:42.200 --> 24:43.700]  Why did they sell this game?
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.780]  I didn't pay for this game, it's on Game Pass.
[24:45.900 --> 24:47.360]  I want a refund still.
[24:47.460 --> 24:48.660]  I want you to pay me.
[24:50.700 --> 24:51.380]  I can't...
[24:51.380 --> 24:53.300]  Piece of dog shit.
[24:53.640 --> 24:55.760]  I think it's because we're both international teams.
[24:55.840 --> 24:56.500]  Maybe it's too much...
[24:56.500 --> 24:57.500]  I'm gonna be the white caps.
[24:58.440 --> 24:59.780]  Gavin, you gotta take it...
[24:59.780 --> 25:00.920]  Gavin, it's Tottenham time.
[25:01.000 --> 25:01.180]  Alright.
[25:01.720 --> 25:02.320]  I'll be Tottenham.
[25:05.620 --> 25:06.880]  I've never felt more confident.
[25:07.380 --> 25:08.540]  You can't handle the white caps.
[25:09.180 --> 25:10.400]  You can't deal with the white caps.
[25:11.160 --> 25:12.840]  I'm gonna get drowned in that sea.
[25:13.060 --> 25:15.720]  It's across MLS.
[25:15.900 --> 25:16.800]  Have these teams ever met?
[25:17.080 --> 25:17.360]  No.
[25:17.780 --> 25:18.720]  Is the pitch smaller?
[25:19.540 --> 25:19.900]  Probably.
[25:20.460 --> 25:21.260]  I don't think so.
[25:21.900 --> 25:22.140]  Okay.
[25:22.880 --> 25:23.840]  Oh shit.
[25:24.140 --> 25:26.680]  Maybe it's just the stage is smaller, Gavin.
[25:26.860 --> 25:27.160]  Oh!
[25:27.240 --> 25:27.620]  No!
[25:28.020 --> 25:28.400]  Block it!
[25:28.720 --> 25:29.540]  Oh no!
[25:29.760 --> 25:29.980]  Yeah!
[25:32.720 --> 25:33.800]  Good God.
[25:34.480 --> 25:35.700]  You could've just passed it in.
[25:36.700 --> 25:39.000]  Come on, pass!
[25:42.540 --> 25:43.120]  What?
[25:45.400 --> 25:45.980]  What?
[25:47.220 --> 25:47.800]  Da!
[25:49.040 --> 25:49.460]  Kane!
[25:49.540 --> 25:49.980]  Oh!
[25:50.220 --> 25:50.480]  Ref!
[25:51.460 --> 25:52.880]  Oh, come on.
[25:55.040 --> 25:55.620]  Oh!
[25:57.040 --> 25:58.080]  Still alive.
[25:58.680 --> 25:58.920]  Oh!
[25:59.200 --> 25:59.740]  Oh!
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.100]  Man, he goes off me.
[26:01.380 --> 26:03.400]  Very aggressive by Gavin early on.
[26:05.100 --> 26:07.600]  We're seeing the Canada-England difference here.
[26:07.880 --> 26:09.440]  Well, if he's not aggressive early, there's no game.
[26:09.720 --> 26:10.380]  I don't know.
[26:10.380 --> 26:11.280]  I don't know what that was.
[26:13.760 --> 26:14.900]  Come on, Canada!
[26:15.320 --> 26:16.600]  What are you doing?
[26:17.460 --> 26:18.200]  He's all alone.
[26:18.620 --> 26:18.960]  Go!
[26:19.340 --> 26:19.860]  Get it in!
[26:20.080 --> 26:21.040]  Get it in!
[26:22.660 --> 26:25.200]  Why do you keep having this happen?
[26:26.160 --> 26:26.380]  Gavin.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.140]  Gavin.
[26:28.920 --> 26:30.000]  Gavin, are you alright?
[26:30.480 --> 26:30.680]  Gavin?
[26:31.580 --> 26:32.600]  I want to keep it together.
[26:36.440 --> 26:38.660]  What was the keeper thinking?
[26:39.380 --> 26:40.780]  Alright, it's not a good strategy.
[26:41.160 --> 26:42.280]  We'll put that one to bed.
[26:42.740 --> 26:44.280]  It wasn't a good strategy last time.
[26:44.340 --> 26:45.220]  I don't know why you did it again.
[26:45.920 --> 26:47.100]  Well, third time's not the charm.
[26:47.100 --> 26:47.920]  Oh, here we go.
[26:48.680 --> 26:49.040]  No.
[26:50.140 --> 26:50.500]  No!
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.860]  Almost with the response.
[26:55.740 --> 26:55.940]  Oh!
[26:57.480 --> 26:58.520]  I said there was a penalty.
[26:58.820 --> 26:59.360]  Give me that.
[26:59.680 --> 27:00.240]  Oh, get it in!
[27:00.240 --> 27:00.580]  Oh!
[27:01.020 --> 27:01.380]  Yeah!
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.220]  This goalie's locked in.
[27:03.380 --> 27:03.660]  Yeah.
[27:03.660 --> 27:03.920]  Okay.
[27:06.320 --> 27:08.440]  You think for a second, oh, this is dangerous.
[27:08.600 --> 27:10.320]  But then you're like, oh, right, it's Gavin.
[27:10.760 --> 27:10.940]  Yeah.
[27:12.480 --> 27:12.900]  Yeah.
[27:14.100 --> 27:16.160]  That was a perfect example of that, Geoff.
[27:23.090 --> 27:23.510]  What?
[27:23.970 --> 27:24.990]  I didn't do that.
[27:25.790 --> 27:26.030]  You didn't?
[27:26.590 --> 27:27.470]  That was all you.
[27:29.590 --> 27:30.850]  Okay, cross, cross.
[27:31.170 --> 27:32.610]  Oh, my legs, son.
[27:34.730 --> 27:35.570]  My legs.
[27:37.850 --> 27:39.430]  Oh, no more of that.
[27:39.510 --> 27:40.110]  That is unacceptable.
[27:41.030 --> 27:41.290]  Ain't no more of that.
[27:41.390 --> 27:43.410]  That's a big no-no on this pitch.
[27:43.630 --> 27:44.870]  That's, it's just a warning.
[27:45.170 --> 27:45.910]  Just a warning.
[27:46.390 --> 27:47.290]  No card.
[27:48.530 --> 27:49.290]  Next time.
[27:49.770 --> 27:50.710]  Oh, look at this.
[27:50.890 --> 27:52.610]  From 39 Mitres.
[27:56.600 --> 27:57.680]  That's way too high.
[27:57.940 --> 27:58.780]  That's way too high.
[27:59.020 --> 27:59.480]  No, maybe not.
[27:59.700 --> 28:00.020]  That's gonna be way too high.
[28:00.680 --> 28:01.120]  Maybe not.
[28:01.280 --> 28:01.640]  Wow!
[28:03.220 --> 28:05.980]  I'm surprised it stayed on that angle for so long.
[28:06.200 --> 28:06.680]  Yeah.
[28:08.920 --> 28:09.440]  Oh!
[28:10.780 --> 28:11.300]  Oh!
[28:11.840 --> 28:12.960]  Oh, what a play!
[28:13.540 --> 28:14.800]  To get it out of there.
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.060]  Back to Kane, the hero.
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.560]  Oh, back pass, left it.
[28:22.640 --> 28:23.400]  Fuck outta here.
[28:23.400 --> 28:25.580]  Huge cross to the other side.
[28:26.020 --> 28:26.540]  No!
[28:27.840 --> 28:28.100]  No!
[28:30.120 --> 28:31.120]  Come on!
[28:31.620 --> 28:31.760]  Yeah.
[28:31.880 --> 28:32.660]  Right there, chicken!
[28:33.180 --> 28:33.600]  Oh!
[28:38.340 --> 28:38.820]  Oops.
[28:41.620 --> 28:44.360]  Getting really, getting really invested in this.
[28:44.740 --> 28:45.640]  Oh, wow!
[28:46.020 --> 28:47.040]  Look at this cross!
[28:47.300 --> 28:47.980]  No, no!
[28:48.520 --> 28:49.000]  Oh!
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.000]  Wow.
[28:56.670 --> 28:57.550]  Wrong option.
[28:57.970 --> 29:00.190]  Yeah, Gavin, you're gonna have to figure out a finesse shot, buddy.
[29:00.430 --> 29:01.550]  Oh, I got that somehow!
[29:02.570 --> 29:03.050]  Oh!
[29:04.990 --> 29:06.230]  What a goal!
[29:06.230 --> 29:08.130]  The Vancouver Whitecaps.
[29:08.130 --> 29:09.430]  I can't believe that!
[29:09.450 --> 29:11.610]  Showing the tongue of Hotspur how it's done.
[29:13.090 --> 29:14.710]  Speaking of a finesse shot.
[29:15.030 --> 29:15.330]  Oh!
[29:16.570 --> 29:18.730]  I just pushed B. I didn't even hit any other buttons.
[29:19.070 --> 29:20.790]  That was a lone B?
[29:21.070 --> 29:21.990]  That was a lone B.
[29:22.110 --> 29:23.590]  I wonder if there was a direction involved.
[29:27.750 --> 29:28.670]  Oh, that was nice.
[29:28.710 --> 29:29.890]  Gavin, are you gonna give B another try?
[29:30.230 --> 29:30.250]  Oh!
[29:30.530 --> 29:31.870]  Hey, Gavin, what button was that?
[29:33.030 --> 29:33.470]  B.
[29:33.770 --> 29:34.210]  Gavin!
[29:35.410 --> 29:36.530]  He's gonna tap it.
[29:46.820 --> 29:47.660]  Oh, no!
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.520]  What are you...
[29:49.520 --> 29:49.800]  Gavin!
[29:51.260 --> 29:51.700]  Gavin.
[29:51.900 --> 29:52.820]  He's giving up.
[29:53.420 --> 29:54.620]  He doesn't know how to...
[29:54.620 --> 29:55.540]  I'm coming all the way, son!
[29:55.880 --> 29:56.660]  Try and stop me!
[29:56.880 --> 29:57.120]  Oh, shit!
[29:57.120 --> 29:58.740]  Try and stop me, you frickin' mug!
[29:59.620 --> 29:59.760]  Oh.
[30:00.700 --> 30:01.380]  Oh, shit.
[30:02.180 --> 30:02.560]  Oh, this is bad.
[30:02.560 --> 30:02.700]  Go!
[30:04.460 --> 30:04.900]  Offside.
[30:05.200 --> 30:06.500]  That actually saved you.
[30:06.520 --> 30:06.960]  Yes, it did.
[30:09.820 --> 30:10.700]  Another warning.
[30:11.040 --> 30:11.320]  Gavin.
[30:11.940 --> 30:12.240]  Gavin.
[30:14.880 --> 30:16.640]  Just tap B, Gavin.
[30:17.200 --> 30:17.500]  Gavin.
[30:17.700 --> 30:18.520]  You just tap it?
[30:18.660 --> 30:19.140]  That's what I said.
[30:19.180 --> 30:19.620]  Just tap it.
[30:19.680 --> 30:20.420]  I just tapped it.
[30:21.080 --> 30:21.680]  No, tap it.
[30:29.400 --> 30:30.620]  You got it right here, Gavin.
[30:30.660 --> 30:31.260]  I believe in you.
[30:31.880 --> 30:32.420]  This is it.
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.120]  This is it.
[30:33.200 --> 30:33.760]  Look at this.
[30:33.920 --> 30:34.500]  Oh, money.
[30:34.980 --> 30:35.760]  Come on, come on, come on.
[30:35.800 --> 30:36.460]  Get it!
[30:36.940 --> 30:37.700]  Cross, big cross.
[30:37.820 --> 30:38.560]  Cross, big cross.
[30:39.560 --> 30:40.060]  Stop him.
[30:40.140 --> 30:40.480]  Stop him.
[30:40.560 --> 30:40.880]  Stop him.
[30:41.280 --> 30:42.100]  Oh, see?
[30:42.580 --> 30:42.920]  He has to be.
[30:43.120 --> 30:44.140]  He really put it there, didn't he?
[30:44.440 --> 30:44.820]  Oh, wow.
[30:44.860 --> 30:45.140]  This is bad, though.
[30:45.140 --> 30:45.640]  Yeah, he really did.
[30:45.980 --> 30:46.680]  Oh, shit.
[30:46.940 --> 30:47.660]  Oh, balls.
[30:48.380 --> 30:48.760]  Give me that.
[30:49.020 --> 30:49.660]  Oh, he's offside.
[30:50.120 --> 30:51.720]  That has to be a penalty, no?
[30:52.060 --> 30:52.460]  No?
[30:52.660 --> 30:53.000]  Nope.
[30:53.120 --> 30:54.420]  I was saying, you played the ball in, so...
[30:54.420 --> 30:55.300]  Why would it be a penalty?
[30:57.500 --> 31:00.640]  Sir, I'm used to MLS rules where you can't touch anybody.
[31:00.940 --> 31:01.220]  No!
[31:02.160 --> 31:02.520]  What?
[31:02.640 --> 31:03.040]  Jesus!
[31:03.960 --> 31:05.080]  Oh, my God!
[31:05.100 --> 31:05.800]  He did it!
[31:06.100 --> 31:07.360]  Oh, here comes the disconnect.
[31:07.360 --> 31:08.060]  He's back in.
[31:08.380 --> 31:09.280]  Oh, we're cooking.
[31:10.140 --> 31:11.260]  Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[31:11.260 --> 31:12.320]  Glory, glory, Tottenham Hotspur!
[31:12.740 --> 31:15.000]  Glory, glory, Tottenham Hotspur!
[31:17.820 --> 31:24.020]  I predict on the day, Andrew's going to outscore Gavin 15-3, but Gavin's going to win 1-0.
[31:25.440 --> 31:26.420]  Oh, shit.
[31:26.760 --> 31:27.820]  I've muffed this up.
[31:28.980 --> 31:29.580]  Fuck!
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.380]  You're not the only one.
[31:33.220 --> 31:34.740]  That was close.
[31:35.160 --> 31:36.080]  Get up there, lads!
[31:36.220 --> 31:36.860]  Go long!
[31:37.260 --> 31:38.420]  Get back there!
[31:40.660 --> 31:41.660]  Okay, I just need to...
[31:41.660 --> 31:42.080]  You know what?
[31:42.100 --> 31:43.220]  I just need to play good defense.
[31:43.360 --> 31:43.800]  I'm up by one.
[31:43.800 --> 31:45.920]  Let's just stop pissing around, piss-farting.
[31:48.820 --> 31:49.180]  Oh!
[31:51.240 --> 31:51.600]  Wow.
[31:52.040 --> 31:52.540]  Uh-oh, Gavin.
[31:52.680 --> 31:52.880]  You're farting again.
[31:52.880 --> 31:53.640]  I can't believe that was a penalty.
[31:53.640 --> 31:54.120]  Oh, Gavin!
[31:54.480 --> 31:56.460]  In the 36th minute now.
[31:56.580 --> 31:56.920]  Gavin!
[31:57.940 --> 31:59.020]  What a fuck!
[32:01.440 --> 32:01.680]  Whoops.
[32:03.720 --> 32:04.080]  Shit!
[32:04.360 --> 32:05.280]  It wasn't even on net.
[32:07.680 --> 32:08.400]  Oh, shit.
[32:08.400 --> 32:09.600]  Decent effort.
[32:11.800 --> 32:12.700]  That's what I'm aiming for.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.480]  Just decency.
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.160]  Oh, wow.
[32:15.500 --> 32:16.180]  Could be a cross.
[32:16.240 --> 32:17.760]  You're still onside is Kane.
[32:18.060 --> 32:20.060]  Kane with a lot of movement, a lot of room.
[32:20.380 --> 32:21.240]  Him and the goalie.
[32:21.960 --> 32:22.620]  Oh, no.
[32:22.680 --> 32:23.220]  No, shit.
[32:23.920 --> 32:24.600]  Maybe a...
[32:24.600 --> 32:25.420]  Damn, I've...
[32:25.420 --> 32:27.120]  A bit more of a tap on that one.
[32:28.580 --> 32:29.820]  Slightly harder tap, maybe.
[32:30.320 --> 32:30.600]  Oh!
[32:31.040 --> 32:31.380]  It's alright.
[32:31.480 --> 32:31.860]  He's got it.
[32:32.320 --> 32:34.600]  I thought he was going to slip right past him.
[32:35.240 --> 32:35.900]  Oh, that was nice.
[32:37.220 --> 32:37.660]  No!
[32:38.240 --> 32:38.380]  Oh, shit.
[32:38.380 --> 32:39.000]  Oh, damn it!
[32:39.000 --> 32:39.540]  A little harder tap.
[32:41.180 --> 32:42.600]  Stuart the bumbling idiot.
[32:46.520 --> 32:48.140]  Oh, what a crab!
[32:49.400 --> 32:50.380]  Push, push!
[32:51.620 --> 32:51.900]  Oh!
[32:52.920 --> 32:55.060]  Trying to get one sneaky-beaky in there.
[32:55.800 --> 32:56.540]  It almost worked.
[32:56.580 --> 32:57.400]  My turn, bitch!
[32:57.600 --> 32:58.200]  My turn!
[32:58.460 --> 32:59.820]  I don't know what's going on here!
[33:00.080 --> 33:01.060]  You didn't scout for me!
[33:01.260 --> 33:01.420]  Uh-oh!
[33:01.500 --> 33:02.860]  You didn't scout for this goalie!
[33:03.520 --> 33:03.880]  Die!
[33:04.380 --> 33:04.940]  Oh, shit!
[33:05.100 --> 33:05.640]  Okay, good.
[33:11.110 --> 33:11.630]  Oof!
[33:11.850 --> 33:11.990]  Damn.
[33:13.850 --> 33:14.470]  Oh, shit.
[33:14.510 --> 33:15.430]  We're about to go into half.
[33:15.730 --> 33:16.010]  Uh-oh.
[33:16.070 --> 33:18.510]  In the 45th minute, we're only plus one.
[33:18.510 --> 33:20.210]  You've got to make it count!
[33:20.290 --> 33:20.390]  No!
[33:20.950 --> 33:21.050]  No!
[33:22.030 --> 33:22.710]  Oh, damn!
[33:23.310 --> 33:23.650]  No!
[33:24.850 --> 33:25.710]  The cane!
[33:25.970 --> 33:26.430]  My stitches!
[33:26.730 --> 33:27.250]  He does it!
[33:27.450 --> 33:28.530]  Harry Kane!
[33:29.890 --> 33:30.210]  Kane.
[33:30.510 --> 33:31.010]  Oh, bro!
[33:31.850 --> 33:32.370]  What?!
[33:36.710 --> 33:37.230]  No!
[33:38.150 --> 33:39.070]  Tied at the half!
[33:39.090 --> 33:42.630]  We finally have a full half, and the score is 2-2.
[33:44.810 --> 33:45.330]  Skip!
[33:45.450 --> 33:46.450]  I don't trust it!
[33:46.730 --> 33:48.750]  Just keep going as fast as we can!
[33:49.010 --> 33:50.030]  We've got to get through this!
[33:51.290 --> 33:52.470]  Get the forks out!
[33:52.790 --> 33:53.490]  Fix the pitch!
[33:55.010 --> 33:55.830]  And we're off!
[33:56.290 --> 33:57.210]  And they're off!
[33:57.510 --> 33:58.290]  Oh, wow!
[34:01.510 --> 34:02.470]  Uh-oh.
[34:02.470 --> 34:03.670]  We made it to a second half, guys.
[34:03.910 --> 34:04.290]  You've got nothing but space.
[34:04.690 --> 34:05.530]  You've got nothing but space.
[34:05.770 --> 34:06.250]  Oh!
[34:06.350 --> 34:09.170]  That absolutely destroys the goalie!
[34:09.290 --> 34:10.290]  Get out of here!
[34:11.630 --> 34:15.190]  That was a valid tackle on the goalkeeper halfway up the pitch.
[34:17.530 --> 34:18.510]  No, it wasn't!
[34:26.940 --> 34:27.960]  Oh, here we go!
[34:28.360 --> 34:28.840]  Tottenham!
[34:29.760 --> 34:30.240]  Tottenham!
[34:30.700 --> 34:31.180]  Tottenham!
[34:31.460 --> 34:31.560]  Tottenham!
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.420]  What was that?
[34:35.420 --> 34:35.800]  What happened to me?
[34:36.260 --> 34:37.060]  What happened here?
[34:37.640 --> 34:37.740]  Oh!
[34:38.240 --> 34:38.960]  Did I get fouled?
[34:38.980 --> 34:39.820]  Yes, you did.
[34:40.060 --> 34:40.540]  What?!
[34:40.540 --> 34:41.560]  Yes, you did.
[34:42.000 --> 34:42.980]  Oh, we're at ref POV!
[34:43.220 --> 34:43.700]  POV?
[34:43.840 --> 34:44.160]  Whoa!
[34:44.680 --> 34:45.880]  The ref's got a GoPro!
[34:46.260 --> 34:47.140]  Gonna move him around.
[34:47.860 --> 34:51.000]  Let's see what the fourth official says!
[34:51.400 --> 34:53.180]  No crossing the line, that's it!
[34:54.960 --> 34:55.640]  Wall is up.
[34:55.920 --> 34:56.660]  Everybody grab your balls!
[34:56.660 --> 34:59.140]  My favorite is when they lie down behind the wall.
[34:59.240 --> 34:59.860]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.780]  Alright, I'm gonna aim for your, like, forehead.
[35:04.340 --> 35:05.240]  He's doing it!
[35:05.300 --> 35:05.940]  He's laying down!
[35:07.500 --> 35:09.780]  He laid down behind the wall!
[35:14.450 --> 35:15.610]  Back to the goalie.
[35:16.030 --> 35:17.790]  Didn't expect that, didn't expect that, did ya?
[35:18.230 --> 35:19.450]  Little trick, little trick.
[35:19.530 --> 35:20.510]  Oh, look at this!
[35:20.890 --> 35:22.810]  Nothing like a slide tackle from behind.
[35:24.830 --> 35:26.730]  The ref's saying, uh, stop.
[35:31.140 --> 35:33.060]  Into the 50th minute now.
[35:33.920 --> 35:35.280]  Oh, what a grab!
[35:35.480 --> 35:35.600]  No.
[35:37.940 --> 35:38.660]  Excellent ref.
[35:38.660 --> 35:39.140]  Stoppering.
[35:42.040 --> 35:43.220]  What is happening?
[35:43.420 --> 35:44.740]  Kane to Madison, Matt...
[35:44.740 --> 35:46.640]  Oh, we're moving up!
[35:47.740 --> 35:50.180]  Oh, what a snag!
[35:50.800 --> 35:51.760]  Boxed you out!
[35:52.080 --> 35:53.000]  No, no!
[35:53.680 --> 35:54.580]  Box me in!
[35:55.020 --> 35:55.160]  No!
[35:55.940 --> 35:56.320]  Oh!
[35:56.780 --> 35:58.460]  Bound in the box!
[35:59.120 --> 36:00.040]  There's a yellow!
[36:01.140 --> 36:02.260]  Oh, here we go!
[36:03.740 --> 36:05.760]  The mind games begin!
[36:06.900 --> 36:10.580]  How the goddamn do I do this?
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.980]  Oh, for God's sake!
[36:15.980 --> 36:17.060]  Why did you do that?
[36:17.080 --> 36:17.800]  Where are the buttons?
[36:17.860 --> 36:18.460]  Why didn't you just...
[36:18.460 --> 36:19.480]  Putting it in the sand!
[36:19.920 --> 36:21.280]  ...to like the bottom left?
[36:21.440 --> 36:22.360]  Why did you do that?
[36:22.680 --> 36:22.740]  Oh!
[36:23.100 --> 36:23.460]  Wow.
[36:23.500 --> 36:24.540]  I just pressed B!
[36:24.900 --> 36:25.620]  You nailed it.
[36:25.740 --> 36:26.280]  Well done.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.040]  Oh, you just stomped me!
[36:34.760 --> 36:36.380]  You had a...
[36:36.380 --> 36:36.660]  Oh, shit!
[36:36.940 --> 36:37.080]  You had a one-off.
[36:37.080 --> 36:38.180]  One-on-one, dude.
[36:39.200 --> 36:39.660]  Oh, Christ.
[36:39.900 --> 36:40.980]  Absolutely incredible.
[36:41.120 --> 36:42.220]  I don't know how penalties work.
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.900]  So much more of the screen was a point than was it.
[36:47.960 --> 36:49.640]  Oh, what a block!
[36:52.960 --> 36:54.940]  And he was pissed at his team.
[36:57.780 --> 36:58.220]  Fuck.
[36:58.460 --> 36:59.380]  It's a bug challenge.
[36:59.400 --> 37:00.440]  Haven't been able to get another header.
[37:01.820 --> 37:03.180]  Can't be offside in your own half!
[37:03.340 --> 37:03.920]  Oh, okay, that's good.
[37:04.980 --> 37:05.480]  Oh, is that right?
[37:05.480 --> 37:06.640]  I didn't even...
[37:06.640 --> 37:07.880]  I didn't even mean to do that.
[37:09.240 --> 37:10.120]  Pass. Pass. Pass.
[37:10.220 --> 37:10.380]  Wow.
[37:10.540 --> 37:10.680]  Pass.
[37:10.680 --> 37:10.960]  Beautiful.
[37:11.180 --> 37:11.360]  Beautiful.
[37:11.800 --> 37:12.940]  Pass. Pass. Pass.
[37:14.620 --> 37:15.060]  Goal!
[37:15.580 --> 37:16.020]  No!
[37:18.840 --> 37:22.020]  That was some beautiful footwork, Andrew.
[37:23.300 --> 37:24.600]  I'm doing a sub.
[37:25.480 --> 37:25.920]  Substituting.
[37:26.940 --> 37:27.540]  That's me.
[37:29.300 --> 37:30.480]  No, I got a prompt, too.
[37:30.580 --> 37:31.380]  I'm also...
[37:31.380 --> 37:32.200]  Alright, okay.
[37:32.280 --> 37:32.680]  That's me.
[37:32.920 --> 37:33.440]  That's me.
[37:37.920 --> 37:38.520]  Header!
[37:43.550 --> 37:44.150]  Shit.
[37:46.150 --> 37:47.850]  Oh, good thing it's not Hurricane.
[37:49.170 --> 37:49.590]  What?
[37:50.610 --> 37:51.190]  Oh, no.
[37:51.710 --> 37:53.490]  That's a raise, guys!
[37:53.650 --> 37:55.570]  And Andrew is a man down!
[37:57.770 --> 37:58.530]  Hell yeah!
[37:58.770 --> 37:59.670]  Uh-oh.
[38:00.630 --> 38:02.490]  Look at that disgraceful tackle.
[38:02.630 --> 38:03.170]  That's ridiculous.
[38:03.290 --> 38:04.670]  Did not go for the ball.
[38:05.050 --> 38:05.370]  Graceful.
[38:06.830 --> 38:08.690]  Am I really a man down now?
[38:08.690 --> 38:09.250]  Yeah.
[38:09.870 --> 38:10.570]  Oh, no.
[38:10.950 --> 38:12.690]  But, Andrew, don't worry about it.
[38:12.730 --> 38:13.830]  It's only for the rest of the game.
[38:13.970 --> 38:14.290]  Shit!
[38:15.850 --> 38:16.790]  I thought you were going to say,
[38:16.870 --> 38:17.410]  don't worry about it.
[38:17.430 --> 38:18.390]  It's only Gavin scoring.
[38:18.910 --> 38:19.990]  No, he'll also miss his...
[38:20.390 --> 38:22.330]  He'll also miss his next game and probably get a fine.
[38:24.710 --> 38:26.810]  I'm not super worried about that,
[38:26.870 --> 38:27.850]  because it's a friendly, so...
[38:28.610 --> 38:28.890]  There you go.
[38:28.910 --> 38:31.050]  Yeah, the fine resets when you turn the Xbox off.
[38:32.710 --> 38:34.610]  Or when Gavin's internet disconnects again.
[38:34.630 --> 38:36.470]  Oh, look at this!
[38:39.690 --> 38:40.130]  Oh!
[38:40.710 --> 38:42.070]  Should've crossed!
[38:42.410 --> 38:43.530]  Had a wide-open man!
[38:43.550 --> 38:44.490]  I got to bring him out.
[38:44.730 --> 38:45.330]  You know, Eric,
[38:45.470 --> 38:48.130]  I have a feeling as long as the score is tied
[38:48.130 --> 38:49.110]  or Gavin's winning,
[38:49.310 --> 38:52.110]  his Xbox internet's going to work just fine.
[38:52.430 --> 38:54.410]  Is it going to bother stopping his goalie?
[38:55.370 --> 38:55.590]  Go!
[38:55.630 --> 38:56.490]  The goalie will!
[38:57.090 --> 38:57.570]  Goalie on goal!
[38:57.570 --> 38:57.830]  No!
[39:02.070 --> 39:02.950]  Wonderful save.
[39:04.990 --> 39:05.850]  Oh, here we go.
[39:05.910 --> 39:06.630]  Here's some movement.
[39:06.790 --> 39:07.250]  Look at...
[39:07.250 --> 39:07.750]  Let's go.
[39:07.990 --> 39:08.770]  Beautiful passing.
[39:11.070 --> 39:11.510]  Oh!
[39:11.770 --> 39:12.270]  I didn't want to do that!
[39:12.370 --> 39:12.990]  Why did you do that?
[39:13.870 --> 39:15.410]  I was trying to cross to the other side.
[39:15.430 --> 39:16.150]  Oh, this is not a bounce.
[39:16.790 --> 39:17.330]  Roll out of bounds.
[39:17.570 --> 39:17.950]  There we go.
[39:18.670 --> 39:20.630]  Into the 70th minute here.
[39:21.330 --> 39:22.330]  Giving him the ball.
[39:24.410 --> 39:24.850]  Substitution.
[39:25.070 --> 39:27.430]  Andrew determined to score with his goalie.
[39:28.710 --> 39:29.290]  Here we go.
[39:31.650 --> 39:33.170]  Sebastian Berwalter is on now.
[39:33.750 --> 39:34.030]  Die!
[39:34.710 --> 39:34.870]  Die!
[39:36.030 --> 39:36.250]  Die!
[39:38.310 --> 39:38.750]  Die!
[39:38.910 --> 39:39.010]  Die!
[39:39.010 --> 39:39.330]  Shit!
[39:40.010 --> 39:41.130]  Great play.
[39:41.290 --> 39:42.530]  Still onside!
[39:43.790 --> 39:44.970]  No, no, no.
[39:45.390 --> 39:45.970]  Come back around!
[39:47.890 --> 39:50.070]  What a block, but that'll be a corner.
[39:56.820 --> 39:58.400]  Corner to nobody.
[40:01.600 --> 40:03.400]  We got to get some more subs in.
[40:06.820 --> 40:07.980]  He's getting fresh.
[40:09.100 --> 40:09.500]  Oh!
[40:11.820 --> 40:17.430]  Go, go, go!
[40:18.110 --> 40:19.150]  Getting locked in here.
[40:19.470 --> 40:20.630]  Whoa, what a tumble!
[40:22.650 --> 40:23.450]  Nice stop!
[40:24.450 --> 40:24.850]  Shit.
[40:25.050 --> 40:26.890]  Why do all my players have a red triangle on them?
[40:27.410 --> 40:27.790]  They're tired probably.
[40:27.790 --> 40:29.050]  They're probably hurt or tired.
[40:30.590 --> 40:32.330]  Or it means you're controlling them.
[40:32.330 --> 40:32.990]  Yeah, it's probably that.
[40:35.830 --> 40:36.490]  Was that offside?
[40:36.570 --> 40:37.550]  Yeah, offside!
[40:37.670 --> 40:39.090]  It didn't seem offside when...
[40:39.090 --> 40:40.050]  I guess so.
[40:42.050 --> 40:44.970]  Oh my God, it feels like I'm missing six players.
[40:48.610 --> 40:49.150]  Ross?
[40:49.570 --> 40:51.090]  No, uh-uh, you ain't getting over.
[40:51.230 --> 40:51.790]  You ain't getting over.
[40:52.270 --> 40:53.310]  Oh, pulled up!
[40:55.170 --> 40:55.810]  Nice header.
[40:56.230 --> 40:57.230]  Back to the third.
[40:58.550 --> 40:59.730]  Middle and back!
[41:00.130 --> 41:00.810]  Tricky kick!
[41:01.070 --> 41:01.950]  The kick is wide!
[41:05.110 --> 41:06.050]  Too much B.
[41:10.590 --> 41:12.030]  Remember when Gavin had that penalty?
[41:12.930 --> 41:13.250]  Yeah.
[41:13.510 --> 41:14.010]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[41:14.150 --> 41:14.470]  Jesus!
[41:14.550 --> 41:16.050]  Oh, look at this, what a move!
[41:19.050 --> 41:19.370]  Oh!
[41:20.130 --> 41:21.250]  Oh, that'll be a corner.
[41:21.650 --> 41:22.370]  That'll be a corner.
[41:24.290 --> 41:26.630]  Since this is a friendly, it'll probably go to a draw, right?
[41:26.690 --> 41:28.330]  Like we won't have penalty kicks, I assume?
[41:28.410 --> 41:29.030]  I would think so.
[41:29.070 --> 41:29.530]  Oh, that's a shame.
[41:31.390 --> 41:33.430]  Well, maybe we could just do a...
[41:34.350 --> 41:34.990]  Nice bicycle!
[41:35.190 --> 41:35.690]  The Pele!
[41:39.120 --> 41:39.440]  No!
[41:39.440 --> 41:41.540]  Nice play on the ball from Gavin.
[41:41.900 --> 41:42.720]  Oh, that's beautiful.
[41:42.720 --> 41:44.220]  Sending the ball back up!
[41:44.500 --> 41:45.340]  Get out of here.
[41:45.360 --> 41:46.360]  Gotta stay on the sides.
[41:46.740 --> 41:46.960]  Oh!
[41:47.040 --> 41:47.700]  What a goal!
[41:52.220 --> 41:54.040]  Richardson all the way!
[41:54.860 --> 41:59.460]  That goal all but assures the internet stays up for the rest of this video.
[42:03.100 --> 42:05.060]  I feel like you're tempted fate, Geoff.
[42:06.760 --> 42:07.840]  What a goal!
[42:08.180 --> 42:08.920]  I get it, I get it.
[42:09.540 --> 42:12.220]  The right foot into the top left corner.
[42:12.900 --> 42:14.260]  Can the Whitecaps answer?
[42:16.360 --> 42:17.080]  Gavin's gonna answer.
[42:17.280 --> 42:18.460]  With just the right amount of B.
[42:19.680 --> 42:21.820]  Yeah, Gavin, was that B into something or was it just B?
[42:22.060 --> 42:22.720]  Uh-oh.
[42:23.240 --> 42:23.840]  That was a little bit of B.
[42:24.500 --> 42:24.760]  Oops.
[42:25.080 --> 42:26.660]  Don't foul him in the box here!
[42:26.700 --> 42:27.060]  No!
[42:27.700 --> 42:28.540]  Oh, Andrew!
[42:30.680 --> 42:32.960]  Nice clearance there from Tottenham.
[42:33.340 --> 42:34.640]  Go, go, go, push, push, push, push.
[42:36.040 --> 42:37.900]  Come on, you Spurs!
[42:38.920 --> 42:39.520]  No!
[42:40.940 --> 42:41.400]  No!
[42:42.660 --> 42:44.040]  Oh, off the board!
[42:45.600 --> 42:46.200]  Unbelievable!
[42:47.700 --> 42:48.040]  Red card!
[42:48.500 --> 42:48.900]  Red him!
[42:49.180 --> 42:49.720]  Red him!
[42:50.980 --> 42:53.480]  Why do you get a million warnings?
[42:54.420 --> 42:54.980]  You know.
[42:55.400 --> 42:57.420]  I have one penalty!
[42:57.940 --> 42:59.520]  How can I get ejected?
[43:00.260 --> 43:01.540]  He was playing the ball.
[43:01.660 --> 43:02.760]  Your player ran into him.
[43:03.600 --> 43:03.840]  Yeah.
[43:03.920 --> 43:04.620]  That's insane.
[43:05.500 --> 43:08.720]  Look at this movement.
[43:10.380 --> 43:11.180]  Uh-oh.
[43:11.320 --> 43:11.900]  Oh, dear.
[43:12.140 --> 43:13.540]  Oh, shit.
[43:14.040 --> 43:15.700]  I hit X instead of B.
[43:15.920 --> 43:17.180]  I'm freaking out.
[43:22.450 --> 43:24.050]  Up, up, up, up, up, up.
[43:24.050 --> 43:25.370]  Into the 92nd minute.
[43:25.510 --> 43:26.490]  Here we're at plus four.
[43:26.850 --> 43:27.550]  Stoppage time.
[43:27.790 --> 43:28.490]  Will there be a goal?
[43:28.710 --> 43:28.830]  No!
[43:30.410 --> 43:31.890]  This could be it.
[43:32.230 --> 43:33.190]  No way!
[43:33.930 --> 43:34.150]  Whoa!
[43:35.650 --> 43:36.730]  This changes nothing.
[43:38.470 --> 43:41.770]  We are in the 93rd minute now.
[43:41.770 --> 43:43.330]  Tottenham's last chance.
[43:43.610 --> 43:45.190]  Look at this grab.
[43:45.650 --> 43:48.810]  Vancouver having to make something happen here.
[43:48.950 --> 43:49.310]  Here we go.
[43:49.890 --> 43:50.590]  No!
[43:52.730 --> 43:54.130]  Full time.
[43:55.050 --> 43:56.190]  That is it.
[43:56.750 --> 43:58.870]  Fifth time was a charm.
[43:59.330 --> 44:00.390]  Wow, he did it.
[44:02.450 --> 44:04.120]  We love you, Tottenham.
[44:04.710 --> 44:05.490]  We do.
[44:05.490 --> 44:05.910]  No!
[44:08.030 --> 44:08.990]  Oh, Tottenham!
[44:09.130 --> 44:10.330]  Gavin, free.
[44:10.550 --> 44:12.470]  Battle of the ages.
[44:13.290 --> 44:13.530]  Wow.
[44:14.250 --> 44:14.570]  No.
[44:15.310 --> 44:15.990]  Not today.
[44:16.830 --> 44:17.230]  Hell no.
[44:17.530 --> 44:19.570]  So where we stand now...
[44:19.570 --> 44:19.710]  1-1.
[44:19.710 --> 44:19.990]  1-1.
[44:20.050 --> 44:21.110]  Andrew won the cricket.
[44:22.450 --> 44:24.610]  Gavin won the football soccer.
[44:25.330 --> 44:27.510]  Alright, so now it's my turn to bring you a sport.
[44:27.570 --> 44:27.950]  Oh, wow.
[44:27.990 --> 44:28.810]  I guess, yeah.
[44:30.030 --> 44:31.770]  Thanks for bringing me my own sport.
[44:32.170 --> 44:34.610]  Well, I thought I was challenging you in your home games.
[44:34.610 --> 44:35.850]  You could let...
[44:35.850 --> 44:36.770]  Maybe you'll challenge one of mine?
[44:36.870 --> 44:37.550]  You just said, like...
[44:37.550 --> 44:38.070]  Maybe CFL?
[44:38.230 --> 44:41.030]  Use Harry Kane whatever way you want to.
[44:41.170 --> 44:42.430]  And he said, no problem.
[44:42.990 --> 44:43.970]  And Gavin won.
[44:44.270 --> 44:45.010]  Way to go, Gavin.
[44:45.710 --> 44:50.610]  Well, that was a fantastic video that we don't need to linger anymore on Gavin's victory.
[44:50.750 --> 44:51.770]  We can wrap it up.
