[00:00.000 --> 00:08.180]  I think I just want to get to a point where I have so much money that I can just buy all these skins and not have to like, think of like, I want to like, become a whale in these games, I think.
[00:08.420 --> 00:10.260]  I think that's, I think that would be like, a lot of fun.
[00:10.800 --> 00:11.360]  Company expense.
[00:12.420 --> 00:18.260]  Nah, not, but like, I mean, I like, I want to like, go for it. I don't want just the ones that I want. I want everything, you know what I mean?
[00:19.160 --> 00:19.620]  Fair enough.
[00:19.620 --> 00:30.440]  Like, I want to be able to get the ultra skin for Tracer Pack Florent, the replacer, and never use it, but have the option to have it.
[00:30.840 --> 00:37.380]  Like, you could say company expense. I get that. I'm just not that kind of guy. I just, I want to be able to.
[00:37.820 --> 00:41.820]  You want the, the black Amex card of all these skins?
[00:41.820 --> 00:46.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I want, I think the problem, has this video started? Is this the beginning of the video?
[00:47.060 --> 00:52.740]  Hello, and welcome to another Regulation Gameplay, or as Nick says, Let's Gameplay.
[00:53.100 --> 00:56.080]  Yeah, let's Regulation Gameplay, fellas.
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.000]  Nick's wearing the mask today, apparently.
[00:58.260 --> 00:58.760]  Yeah, done.
[00:59.580 --> 01:04.740]  I, I had this conversation with friends. Dude, being a Nepo baby must rock so hard.
[01:04.800 --> 01:10.520]  Having, like, my parents are, uh, very talented, but, uh, not rich.
[01:10.520 --> 01:21.200]  And having parents that were talented and rich, so they can give you whatever hookup you want, so you can just write, uh, you just, like, write one pop song, and then go, yeah, that's what I do.
[01:21.220 --> 01:26.860]  And then get, like, a Wikipedia article about you, and you don't have to work very hard, and then you can buy everything in the Warzone store.
[01:27.020 --> 01:29.620]  Like, that seems, oh, God, that seems awesome, doesn't it?
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.120]  Are we talking about Archie someday?
[01:32.200 --> 01:33.680]  Wow, do you think so?
[01:34.600 --> 01:35.920]  Yeah, because that's, wow.
[01:35.920 --> 01:41.220]  That was the thing that me and my friends landed on, is, like, what am I gonna do, have a kid and have him be a fucking fail son for nothing also?
[01:41.320 --> 01:43.580]  Just like me? That sucks. Like, I don't want that.
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.000]  I don't know, I feel like I'd have to put it into trust and wait until he earned his own way.
[01:48.100 --> 01:52.160]  Well, see if he can, see if he can write, like, a pop song or something. That could be fun, right?
[01:52.340 --> 01:54.420]  I don't think he can write at all.
[01:56.020 --> 01:59.180]  Well, imagine if his first written thing is a pop song.
[01:59.340 --> 02:02.560]  Hey, Nick, don't worry about it. JoJo Siwa can't either, but she's famous.
[02:05.920 --> 02:09.940]  It just seems like being, like, a Nepo baby, but it just must rock.
[02:10.820 --> 02:17.420]  I think about that whenever, I mean, when we do, like, a movie auction type thing, when I look at that stuff.
[02:17.660 --> 02:25.620]  I think about, imagine if I was Geoff Bezos doing this, and I could just buy every single thing without even thinking about it.
[02:25.620 --> 02:26.840]  Just buy the auction house.
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.860]  Just buy it all.
[02:29.880 --> 02:32.120]  God, that would be so cool, wouldn't it?
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.880]  It would be so cool to just have all that stuff show up and be like, oh yeah, I did this.
[02:38.080 --> 02:43.920]  I saw a TikTok the other day, who knows how true it is, but it was of some dude in New York City in, like, the Upper West Side or Upper East Side.
[02:43.980 --> 02:44.660]  One of the sides.
[02:45.120 --> 02:49.860]  And he was bitching because Geoff Bezos was moving furniture into his top floor apartment.
[02:49.860 --> 02:50.900]  Oh, I saw that. Yeah.
[02:51.120 --> 02:58.780]  And they shut the road down to put a giant, like, construction crane on the street to load his furniture up.
[02:59.140 --> 03:06.380]  And it's like, that's how you know you're rich, when you can shut a New York City street down for half a day to move your piano in.
[03:06.680 --> 03:08.920]  And you don't have to be there.
[03:09.220 --> 03:11.180]  Like, you don't have to...
[03:11.180 --> 03:12.580]  He doesn't have to be there to sign the paper.
[03:12.680 --> 03:19.920]  Yeah, and Geoff, I know that that's sort of how you operate, is that you're just, like, not there for the moves or whatever, and I think that's really special for you, but, you know...
[03:19.920 --> 03:20.960]  Didn't work for me this time.
[03:21.040 --> 03:22.000]  Yeah, no, you blew it.
[03:23.620 --> 03:27.240]  I tried. I went out of town on vacation, and y'all just didn't do anything for the three weeks I was gone.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.340]  Yep, you fool.
[03:28.820 --> 03:29.180]  Yeah.
[03:29.900 --> 03:31.720]  Came back and everything was still in a box.
[03:31.940 --> 03:32.380]  Goddamn right.
[03:32.640 --> 03:32.920]  Son of a bitch.
[03:33.340 --> 03:34.820]  Let's see where we're going.
[03:35.320 --> 03:35.720]  Where we dropping?
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.080]  Oh, fuck, who remembers?
[03:38.420 --> 03:39.080]  I know this map.
[03:39.180 --> 03:42.180]  Let's jump off the battle bus, guys. Let's do this thing.
[03:42.540 --> 03:46.860]  Hey, you wanna get in hot and heavy? Just drop right on the hospital. Right on the top. Right here.
[03:47.280 --> 03:47.640]  Awesome.
[03:48.160 --> 03:48.500]  Mark it.
[03:48.960 --> 03:49.720]  I'll do whatever you want.
[03:50.040 --> 03:50.240]  It's green.
[03:50.920 --> 03:52.060]  I see it. I see it. Okay.
[03:52.640 --> 03:52.880]  Okay.
[03:53.040 --> 03:53.200]  Yeah.
[03:54.040 --> 03:54.640]  Let's do it.
[03:54.980 --> 03:56.220]  We'll all die. We'll respawn.
[03:56.220 --> 03:58.280]  That's because your ankle integrity is so good right now.
[03:59.200 --> 04:00.320]  Yep, that's true.
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.500]  Call out when you guys jump.
[04:02.160 --> 04:02.400]  Okay.
[04:02.560 --> 04:04.060]  Did they shrink this map?
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.120]  It feels like it. It feels, it feels, everything feels weird.
[04:07.340 --> 04:08.140]  It feels so tiny.
[04:08.560 --> 04:12.480]  It feels tighter, but that might just be because the other map feels so much smaller.
[04:12.720 --> 04:14.840]  I also have a ton of lag. I don't know about you guys.
[04:15.080 --> 04:15.340]  Really?
[04:15.800 --> 04:18.520]  Which is weird because I have, I'm hardwired in.
[04:18.780 --> 04:19.680]  Yeah, you're hard alright.
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.300]  Yeah, what?
[04:21.500 --> 04:23.000]  Wired in, shut up.
[04:24.920 --> 04:26.200]  Alright, I deployed my parachute.
[04:28.940 --> 04:30.040]  Fight and die, fight and die.
[04:30.620 --> 04:31.240]  Scared me, Nick.
[04:32.020 --> 04:32.620]  Hey, it's me.
[04:32.940 --> 04:33.480]  Kill my parachute.
[04:35.140 --> 04:35.800]  Oh, it's you.
[04:35.920 --> 04:36.480]  It's me, baby.
[04:38.060 --> 04:38.820]  That's right, I got this.
[04:38.960 --> 04:40.720]  Well, we didn't die instantly, so let's get inside.
[04:40.920 --> 04:41.480]  Take a look around.
[04:42.820 --> 04:43.300]  Oh, hi Geoff.
[04:43.400 --> 04:44.460]  Sorry, I almost killed you.
[04:45.580 --> 04:47.000]  Don't be opening doors on me like that, dude.
[04:47.700 --> 04:48.400]  It's all of us.
[04:48.660 --> 04:50.100]  God damn, that could have been the end of you.
[04:50.360 --> 04:51.080]  Alright, I'm descending.
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.800]  Are you guys, like, not opening chests or what?
[04:55.020 --> 04:55.340]  I did.
[04:56.280 --> 04:58.800]  I got a blue access card, is that good?
[04:58.860 --> 04:59.440]  Oh, we got people.
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.200]  I'll hold on to that, don't know what that does, but...
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.420]  Might provide access.
[05:03.680 --> 05:06.020]  Oh, don't forget if you got armor up, armor up.
[05:06.220 --> 05:07.520]  Oh, yeah, what's the button for armor?
[05:08.140 --> 05:08.600]  Hold Y.
[05:09.280 --> 05:09.680]  Thank you.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.600]  I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
[05:12.460 --> 05:13.780]  Oh, shit, Jesus, you scared me.
[05:14.020 --> 05:15.580]  Yeah, see, that's not so fun, is it?
[05:15.860 --> 05:16.740]  Yeah, but I didn't shoot you.
[05:17.020 --> 05:18.020]  There are people all over.
[05:18.760 --> 05:20.520]  Alright, I see Johnny Caviar.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.060]  You're good.
[05:21.300 --> 05:21.960]  I'm with you guys.
[05:22.180 --> 05:22.500]  Here we go.
[05:22.640 --> 05:24.440]  How many frames do I have in your lag?
[05:24.540 --> 05:25.060]  Do I look good?
[05:25.100 --> 05:25.740]  Do I got 60?
[05:25.880 --> 05:27.880]  As long as I don't strafe, you're fine.
[05:28.240 --> 05:28.480]  Oh, good.
[05:28.880 --> 05:29.340]  That's cool.
[05:29.520 --> 05:32.300]  I'm thinking about in a game like this, I don't think you have to do that, so it should be fine.
[05:32.600 --> 05:33.980]  No, you don't gotta move at all.
[05:35.480 --> 05:37.660]  It's kind of like Doom Dark Ages, you just kind of remain stationary.
[05:37.900 --> 05:38.540]  You're just sort of like...
[05:38.540 --> 05:39.820]  Yeah, he's playing Elden Ring.
[05:39.940 --> 05:42.120]  Maybe let's pick up that scavenger over there.
[05:42.300 --> 05:42.500]  Okay.
[05:42.880 --> 05:45.320]  Man, I have not touched Call of Duty in a minute.
[05:46.020 --> 05:47.040]  Oh, we gotta cut through here, though.
[05:47.200 --> 05:49.220]  When did we do the smoke thing?
[05:49.220 --> 05:50.420]  Because that was the last time I played this.
[05:50.920 --> 05:51.560]  Same year.
[05:51.680 --> 05:56.200]  That was probably in March, so I played for maybe two weeks after that.
[05:56.400 --> 05:58.200]  So I got all my skins.
[05:58.620 --> 05:59.820]  I just don't play this kind of game.
[06:01.300 --> 06:05.680]  It's odd, because I spent probably hundreds of hours playing this version of Warzone,
[06:05.960 --> 06:09.140]  so I feel like I know what I'm doing, but remembering, oh no, I'm in a different game.
[06:09.520 --> 06:13.600]  It's just everything looks the same, but it does not work how I remember.
[06:14.100 --> 06:15.340]  It's a little different, for sure.
[06:15.560 --> 06:15.880]  Oh, money.
[06:16.480 --> 06:18.700]  This is probably the Call of Duty I've played the most in my life.
[06:18.700 --> 06:21.100]  Yeah, you have a blue number or something, right?
[06:21.680 --> 06:22.180]  Alright, follow me.
[06:22.720 --> 06:24.060]  Your number is blue, which is good.
[06:24.760 --> 06:25.240]  I don't know.
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.580]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[06:27.980 --> 06:29.480]  Man, I'm following Geoff.
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.600]  I just don't know if that's the move.
[06:33.120 --> 06:35.260]  Don't follow me, I'm bouncing around the fucking map.
[06:35.480 --> 06:36.560]  Yeah, no, I'm following you.
[06:36.840 --> 06:37.380]  Me and you, buddy.
[06:37.480 --> 06:41.740]  Remember in Halo 2, when you'd see somebody with like half a moon as their level,
[06:41.860 --> 06:42.760]  and you'd just go, oh, they're good.
[06:43.840 --> 06:45.480]  They evolved beyond numbers.
[06:46.720 --> 06:48.480]  Alright, I'm gonna snag this, get ready to grab...
[06:49.160 --> 06:50.120]  Guys, I'm fucked.
[06:51.380 --> 06:52.460]  Scavenger in progress, guys.
[06:53.260 --> 06:54.720]  I'm getting all cozy in the tub.
[06:55.520 --> 06:56.660]  Alright, let's head to this.
[07:04.860 --> 07:11.520]  Alright, boys, now we're making a Let's Play video.
[07:11.520 --> 07:12.780]  Okay, okay.
[07:14.900 --> 07:16.000]  I got him, don't worry.
[07:16.100 --> 07:16.900]  They're trying to come in here.
[07:17.000 --> 07:17.600]  Oh, they're fucked.
[07:18.040 --> 07:22.860]  Hey, does it look like I'm sticking my head in the toilet like I'm Geoff or Eric on the ground?
[07:22.960 --> 07:23.980]  Lay down on the ground.
[07:24.280 --> 07:25.200]  Here, there you go.
[07:28.540 --> 07:29.340]  Now I'm Gavin.
[07:30.500 --> 07:31.780]  Now I'm Gavin Pukin.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.360]  Standing on the toilet to get as far away from it as possible.
[07:35.780 --> 07:36.400]  Nick, where'd you go?
[07:37.000 --> 07:37.380]  I'm in here.
[07:37.860 --> 07:38.160]  Oh, okay.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.100]  I'm in the bathroom now.
[07:39.180 --> 07:40.140]  Can I join you in the tub?
[07:40.140 --> 07:40.580]  Oh, Pukin.
[07:41.720 --> 07:42.180]  Oh, look.
[07:44.100 --> 07:45.880]  Oh, fire!
[07:48.240 --> 07:48.860]  Menage a fire.
[07:49.040 --> 07:49.740]  Can't get me out of the tub.
[07:50.020 --> 07:50.780]  I'm in water.
[07:50.980 --> 07:52.040]  It doesn't impact me.
[07:52.600 --> 07:53.240]  I'm immune.
[07:55.220 --> 07:55.860]  Are we?
[07:56.000 --> 07:56.880]  So we're just hanging out here?
[07:56.940 --> 07:57.840]  Is that what's going on?
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.320]  Yeah, why not?
[07:58.420 --> 08:00.300]  Yeah, but there's like a lot of people around us.
[08:00.460 --> 08:01.340]  It's not great.
[08:01.940 --> 08:03.000]  What does the trophy system do?
[08:03.020 --> 08:03.640]  I have one.
[08:04.380 --> 08:07.280]  It stops any kind of grenades or projectiles.
[08:07.680 --> 08:08.240]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[08:08.620 --> 08:09.280]  Come in the area.
[08:10.520 --> 08:11.600]  Is this a LaBooBoo?
[08:12.040 --> 08:12.740]  Oh, let me see.
[08:12.740 --> 08:13.940]  Is this what everyone's excited about?
[08:14.340 --> 08:15.100]  Hang on, let's have a look.
[08:15.160 --> 08:15.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:16.120 --> 08:17.340]  I think this might be a LaBooBoo.
[08:17.580 --> 08:17.900]  Guys?
[08:18.240 --> 08:19.180]  It's a secret one.
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.220]  Yeah, it's a secret LaBooBoo.
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.120]  I think it's a LaFooFoo.
[08:21.200 --> 08:21.700]  It's a fake one.
[08:22.380 --> 08:23.220]  Oh, it's a LaFooFoo.
[08:23.380 --> 08:24.600]  Did you get that at the swap meet?
[08:24.880 --> 08:26.880]  Yeah, I got it on the back of this guy's truck.
[08:28.200 --> 08:29.000]  The swindle meet.
[08:29.460 --> 08:31.380]  Get down to San Antonio to get all your LaFooFoos.
[08:31.520 --> 08:32.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[08:32.480 --> 08:33.480]  Oh, the swine meet.
[08:34.460 --> 08:36.280]  Well, we're not going to get the scavenger, I don't think.
[08:36.400 --> 08:36.700]  Why?
[08:37.740 --> 08:39.100]  Well, we could do it.
[08:39.100 --> 08:39.640]  There's a truck coming in.
[08:39.760 --> 08:41.440]  We have a minute and 48 seconds to do it.
[08:41.540 --> 08:43.120]  There's a truck that's driving around.
[08:43.220 --> 08:43.640]  Is that good?
[08:45.180 --> 08:46.220]  Take that, truck!
[08:46.900 --> 08:47.180]  Yeah!
[08:47.320 --> 08:47.540]  Oh, did you shoot it?
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.360]  Did you shoot the truck?
[08:48.380 --> 08:49.260]  I think I hit him once.
[08:51.420 --> 08:52.240]  It's a lot of missing.
[08:52.840 --> 08:54.160]  Definitely scared the shit out of him.
[08:54.180 --> 08:55.020]  Oh, he's getting back in.
[08:55.340 --> 08:55.620]  Is he?
[08:55.740 --> 08:56.020]  That's me.
[08:56.440 --> 08:57.060]  Oh, wow, he's gone.
[08:57.300 --> 08:57.820]  Oh, kill him!
[08:58.040 --> 08:58.340]  Kill him!
[08:58.720 --> 08:59.380]  He's out of here.
[09:01.920 --> 09:03.360]  That last mag, guys.
[09:03.460 --> 09:03.680]  That'll teach you.
[09:03.680 --> 09:04.360]  Who's out of ammo?
[09:04.560 --> 09:05.220]  What happened?
[09:05.280 --> 09:05.960]  Nothing happened.
[09:06.560 --> 09:07.520]  I'm pretty much out of ammo.
[09:08.060 --> 09:08.420]  Damn!
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.340]  Andrew and I unloaded on that dude.
[09:10.560 --> 09:12.180]  Yeah, I hit him like twice.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.520]  What's the magnifying glass mean?
[09:13.580 --> 09:15.660]  Does that mean there's like a mystery we have to solve?
[09:16.500 --> 09:18.180]  Oh, we can go to the scavenger thing.
[09:18.300 --> 09:18.620]  Oh, okay.
[09:18.860 --> 09:19.700]  I thought Nick didn't...
[09:19.700 --> 09:20.140]  Let's do it!
[09:20.320 --> 09:20.820]  Big shot!
[09:21.980 --> 09:22.680]  I'm getting shot.
[09:22.900 --> 09:23.500]  Stop the clock.
[09:23.600 --> 09:24.200]  Stop the clock.
[09:24.400 --> 09:24.900]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[09:25.100 --> 09:25.660]  That guy's down.
[09:25.740 --> 09:26.280]  That guy's down.
[09:26.640 --> 09:27.640]  There's another one over here.
[09:27.680 --> 09:28.100]  I killed him.
[09:29.280 --> 09:30.860]  Okay, I got armor up.
[09:30.960 --> 09:31.640]  There's a zone ringing in here.
[09:32.540 --> 09:33.260]  Answer it, dude.
[09:34.060 --> 09:34.960]  I'm trying to find it.
[09:35.800 --> 09:37.580]  Okay, they're in the emergency room door.
[09:37.700 --> 09:38.320]  Oh, there's a dude down here.
[09:39.340 --> 09:39.920]  Oh, shit!
[09:41.680 --> 09:42.260]  I got him.
[09:42.260 --> 09:42.640]  Alright, he's down.
[09:42.860 --> 09:43.880]  Are they a bunch of dragonflies?
[09:43.880 --> 09:44.460]  Well, you got him.
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.660]  I just shot his corpse.
[09:45.680 --> 09:47.400]  If you would not believe your eyes.
[09:49.680 --> 09:50.640]  Don't forget to armor up.
[09:50.760 --> 09:52.460]  I get that reference now because of this podcast.
[09:53.700 --> 09:54.100]  Hey, what's up?
[09:54.420 --> 09:55.200]  What exploded?
[09:56.600 --> 09:57.900]  We got a helicopter on the roof.
[09:57.940 --> 09:58.520]  We should take that.
[09:58.540 --> 09:59.240]  Yeah, let's do that.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.040]  Yeah, let's do that.
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.160]  Let's go over to the scavenge and then we'll do that.
[10:02.180 --> 10:03.060]  Scavenge all this stuff?
[10:03.160 --> 10:03.340]  Yep.
[10:03.340 --> 10:04.180]  Upsy-dupsy.
[10:04.840 --> 10:05.640]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[10:05.700 --> 10:06.720]  You look flying.
[10:08.040 --> 10:09.060]  What do we got?
[10:09.440 --> 10:10.400]  Oh, you got it already?
[10:10.480 --> 10:10.680]  Nice.
[10:10.680 --> 10:11.240]  That seems good.
[10:11.520 --> 10:12.000]  Anything good?
[10:12.280 --> 10:13.500]  I don't know.
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.640]  Some ammo, some guns.
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.120]  Okay, we got one more we got to do.
[10:16.260 --> 10:17.400]  Some ammo, some guns.
[10:18.020 --> 10:18.740]  We landed.
[10:20.120 --> 10:22.140]  No little boo-boos if that's what you're looking for.
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.660]  I was looking for, you know, a description of a type of gun.
[10:25.940 --> 10:26.700]  Nah, don't worry about it.
[10:26.700 --> 10:27.260]  Oh, it was an SMG?
[10:27.260 --> 10:28.980]  I'm looking for Le Stair Stairs.
[10:29.320 --> 10:29.840]  There we go.
[10:30.820 --> 10:32.100]  Oh, you guys are way over there, huh?
[10:32.100 --> 10:33.380]  I'm in the wrong ass building.
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.400]  Oh, this fucking lag, dude.
[10:38.420 --> 10:40.020]  Yeah, what's up with your computer or whatever?
[10:40.200 --> 10:42.180]  I don't know. Between games, I'm going to reboot my internet.
[10:42.460 --> 10:42.660]  Okay.
[10:43.480 --> 10:44.200]  Sounds good.
[10:45.140 --> 10:45.960]  I'm almost there.
[10:46.420 --> 10:48.400]  I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still killing motherfuckers, but...
[10:48.400 --> 10:48.940]  No, I hear that.
[10:49.080 --> 10:49.400]  Yeah, you did great.
[10:49.780 --> 10:50.140]  Unstoppable.
[10:51.040 --> 10:52.960]  If anything, it just balances out in the game.
[10:53.240 --> 10:53.960]  Alright, here comes Dad.
[10:54.460 --> 10:55.660]  Alright, boys, here comes Daddy.
[10:56.760 --> 10:57.120]  Yeah!
[10:59.220 --> 10:59.580]  Yeah.
[11:00.600 --> 11:00.920]  I'm in.
[11:01.500 --> 11:04.260]  I'm trying to find the freaking elevators.
[11:04.260 --> 11:05.060]  We can go down to you.
[11:05.240 --> 11:05.460]  Yep.
[11:05.700 --> 11:05.880]  Okay.
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.520]  Nick's using his angry language.
[11:08.120 --> 11:08.980]  He's getting frustrated.
[11:09.680 --> 11:10.480]  What did I say? What happened?
[11:10.580 --> 11:11.220]  Go back out front.
[11:11.640 --> 11:12.820]  You gotta stop being angry.
[11:12.840 --> 11:13.040]  I'm coming.
[11:13.640 --> 11:15.180]  Hello, fellas.
[11:15.580 --> 11:15.900]  Hello.
[11:16.400 --> 11:16.820]  I'm in.
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.320]  Oh, I'm out.
[11:18.320 --> 11:18.680]  What?
[11:18.840 --> 11:19.780]  You're in? You're out?
[11:19.820 --> 11:20.360]  He's out.
[11:20.460 --> 11:23.100]  Well, I jumped in and it was, uh...
[11:23.100 --> 11:23.460]  Yeah.
[11:24.360 --> 11:25.400]  We got marked.
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.200]  I hit it again.
[11:26.660 --> 11:26.980]  Marked for death.
[11:27.180 --> 11:27.540]  There we go.
[11:27.600 --> 11:28.800]  Like that Steven Seagal movie?
[11:28.920 --> 11:29.840]  Alright, keep an eye out, boys.
[11:33.100 --> 11:34.760]  What is he doing?
[11:35.200 --> 11:36.860]  Why are you like this?
[11:37.560 --> 11:38.420]  What are you doing?
[11:38.620 --> 11:41.300]  I hit X to reload and that is just jump out of helicopter.
[11:41.640 --> 11:42.080]  Oh my god.
[11:42.080 --> 11:43.200]  Somebody has to go pick him up.
[11:43.300 --> 11:43.680]  I got him.
[11:43.720 --> 11:45.460]  Why would it be the same as the reload button?
[11:45.460 --> 11:46.040]  I got him.
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.620]  I think one's a click, one's a hold situation.
[11:49.840 --> 11:50.060]  Nope.
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.420]  I just tapped it.
[11:52.060 --> 11:52.400]  Oh, cool.
[11:52.620 --> 11:54.020]  Then it was a hold situation.
[11:54.320 --> 11:55.760]  Yeah, then do the other one next time.
[11:56.520 --> 11:57.140]  But don't.
[11:57.240 --> 11:57.820]  Just don't reload.
[11:57.980 --> 11:58.740]  I'm just not gonna reload.
[11:58.740 --> 11:59.300]  Hey, I'm in the helicopter.
[12:00.420 --> 12:04.700]  Just unload the clip you currently have and it will automatically reload for you.
[12:04.720 --> 12:05.700]  It's a sniper rifle.
[12:06.920 --> 12:08.440]  Oh, well, that's your problem.
[12:09.980 --> 12:12.700]  Also, what are you sniping right now?
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.720]  No, I was gonna say the same thing, Geoff, but he probably needs all the ammo he can get in that thing.
[12:16.940 --> 12:19.320]  I had the same thought and then I circled around.
[12:20.380 --> 12:21.700]  Alright, where are we going?
[12:21.780 --> 12:22.560]  Where do we wanna go?
[12:23.160 --> 12:24.440]  There's a supply run.
[12:25.600 --> 12:26.940]  We have a lot of money, right?
[12:27.020 --> 12:28.500]  We could probably stop at a buy station.
[12:28.500 --> 12:28.680]  Get some money.
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.400]  Get some crap.
[12:30.040 --> 12:31.080]  Get the money.
[12:31.560 --> 12:33.040]  We could... what else?
[12:33.740 --> 12:35.040]  Superstore. I saw that show once.
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.540]  We could get a bounty and just keep an eye on another team somewhere.
[12:38.980 --> 12:42.940]  Yeah, we could do a bounty and try to... I mean, that seems like a terrible idea as far as survivability.
[12:42.940 --> 12:45.000]  I agree, especially watching how Nick plays.
[12:46.100 --> 12:46.740]  Just hitting buttons.
[12:47.420 --> 12:48.620]  Hitting precise buttons.
[12:48.980 --> 12:53.600]  I used to like to camp in this little tower over here.
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.440]  Oh, the camping tower?
[12:54.560 --> 12:56.500]  I used to like to do, yeah, little...
[12:56.500 --> 12:58.120]  You wanna park on the roof and drop down?
[12:58.280 --> 12:59.280]  We'll never get back up again.
[12:59.420 --> 13:00.120]  There's dudes in here.
[13:02.880 --> 13:04.820]  I'm going. I'm going up. I'm going up.
[13:05.000 --> 13:05.640]  Armor up. Armor up.
[13:05.820 --> 13:06.500]  Cluster strike?
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.120]  That doesn't sound good.
[13:08.680 --> 13:09.800]  People don't like that.
[13:10.360 --> 13:11.520]  Oh, I'm getting shot, boys.
[13:12.260 --> 13:12.940]  I'm out of armor.
[13:13.940 --> 13:14.380]  Don't worry.
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.580]  Evasive maneuvers.
[13:18.320 --> 13:19.200]  Evasive maneuvers.
[13:19.880 --> 13:20.940]  Why do you keep saying that?
[13:21.180 --> 13:21.860]  Let's just fly.
[13:22.060 --> 13:22.940]  Evasive maneuvers.
[13:23.240 --> 13:23.520]  Just fly.
[13:28.420 --> 13:29.100]  You fool.
[13:29.780 --> 13:30.620]  I'm taking these guys out.
[13:30.780 --> 13:31.320]  Oh, wait.
[13:31.500 --> 13:32.240]  Okay, you down on purpose?
[13:32.620 --> 13:33.540]  Are we crashing?
[13:33.900 --> 13:34.220]  What's happening?
[13:34.380 --> 13:35.160]  I'm taking these guys out.
[13:35.340 --> 13:35.500]  I'm going back.
[13:36.960 --> 13:38.660]  I'm not running away.
[13:39.340 --> 13:40.800]  What are you doing?
[13:41.400 --> 13:42.120]  I fell out.
[13:43.100 --> 13:44.240]  I think I got sniped out.
[13:44.420 --> 13:46.120]  I definitely didn't do what Nick did earlier.
[13:46.620 --> 13:48.680]  Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
[13:48.720 --> 13:49.220]  I'm coming for you.
[13:49.840 --> 13:50.900]  I'm pretty sure I didn't.
[13:51.020 --> 13:52.060]  I'm pretty sure it was other stuff.
[13:52.600 --> 13:53.700]  This is too wide.
[13:54.180 --> 13:55.400]  Loadout drop is what I wanted to get.
[13:55.400 --> 13:56.000]  There it is.
[13:56.040 --> 13:56.960]  Thank you.
[13:57.160 --> 13:58.780]  Hey, I got your back, man.
[13:59.460 --> 14:00.340]  Accidents happen.
[14:00.400 --> 14:01.360]  Is that a loadout drop right there?
[14:03.200 --> 14:03.620]  No.
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.180]  Okay.
[14:04.300 --> 14:05.220]  It's forever away.
[14:05.500 --> 14:06.020]  Forever away.
[14:07.020 --> 14:07.700]  It's across.
[14:07.860 --> 14:10.560]  It's outside the circle on the other side of the map.
[14:12.300 --> 14:14.180]  All right, let's look for shit here, I guess.
[14:14.760 --> 14:15.040]  Okay.
[14:16.060 --> 14:16.860]  I need armor bad.
[14:19.380 --> 14:21.240]  So the thing with those...
[14:21.240 --> 14:23.120]  Are you ziplining up, Eric?
[14:23.200 --> 14:23.780]  Is that what I'm looking at?
[14:23.780 --> 14:24.340]  Goddamn right.
[14:25.860 --> 14:27.500]  Are you going up to the tower?
[14:27.500 --> 14:28.260]  Goddamn right.
[14:28.360 --> 14:28.840]  I'm not running.
[14:29.300 --> 14:30.180]  He's a zippy-uppy.
[14:30.720 --> 14:32.180]  I'm not running from these fuckers.
[14:34.600 --> 14:35.300]  You know what?
[14:35.840 --> 14:36.280]  I'm going with you.
[14:36.300 --> 14:37.760]  That's what I'm talking about, boys.
[14:38.040 --> 14:38.900]  There's not much I can do.
[14:40.220 --> 14:40.920]  I'm down.
[14:41.640 --> 14:42.040]  Yeah.
[14:43.900 --> 14:46.760]  Well, I'm going to go ahead and abort the mission and come back.
[14:47.140 --> 14:49.420]  Guys, sometimes you got to fight for glory.
[14:50.180 --> 14:51.080]  You got no one to hold.
[14:51.600 --> 14:52.440]  Got no one to fold.
[14:53.480 --> 14:53.940]  Don't fold.
[14:54.060 --> 14:55.180]  Got no one to zip up a tower.
[14:55.180 --> 14:56.280]  I don't fucking fold.
[14:56.460 --> 14:57.080]  Got no one to run.
[14:57.560 --> 14:59.720]  Oh, dude, I'm watching Master Splinter and the Gulag.
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.140]  This is better than what we were doing.
[15:01.260 --> 15:01.780]  This rocks.
[15:02.640 --> 15:03.800]  Master Splinter's in the Gulag.
[15:03.800 --> 15:04.520]  Oh, he won.
[15:04.620 --> 15:05.400]  Master Splinter won.
[15:06.040 --> 15:06.740]  Well, he's the master.
[15:07.120 --> 15:08.040]  Way to go, Master Splinter.
[15:08.820 --> 15:11.700]  I know it doesn't mean it, but Gulag sounds like a fancy sewer word.
[15:11.980 --> 15:13.100]  It doesn't surprise me.
[15:13.560 --> 15:13.900]  Splinter.
[15:14.720 --> 15:15.420]  All right, boys.
[15:15.440 --> 15:15.860]  Here we go.
[15:17.040 --> 15:17.680]  Game time.
[15:17.880 --> 15:18.480]  You got this, Eric.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.920]  I forgot the Gulag was a thing.
[15:21.820 --> 15:23.060]  Where's the rest of my fucking team?
[15:24.120 --> 15:24.940]  I'm in the Gulag.
[15:25.140 --> 15:27.960]  I'm running to help Eric, and then he died.
[15:28.180 --> 15:28.700]  I'm dead.
[15:28.720 --> 15:29.280]  I'm coming back.
[15:29.860 --> 15:31.580]  Oh, we can buy Eric back.
[15:32.020 --> 15:33.460]  Where's the nearest buyback?
[15:34.700 --> 15:35.820]  Oh, it's pretty close.
[15:36.660 --> 15:37.560]  Right behind you, Andrew.
[15:38.160 --> 15:40.460]  After we buy Eric, he will belong to us.
[15:40.640 --> 15:41.400]  We will own him.
[15:42.200 --> 15:43.780]  I don't know if that's the route we want to go down.
[15:43.780 --> 15:44.220]  I don't like that idea.
[15:45.100 --> 15:48.680]  I'm not a big fan of going down that route for this kind of video or whatever.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.900]  Yeah, no, I don't like it.
[15:50.900 --> 15:51.840]  I'm not a big fan.
[15:51.840 --> 15:52.360]  I'm dying.
[15:54.220 --> 15:57.660]  I've got $6,000 with your life on it.
[15:58.240 --> 15:59.700]  Look at this. Nobody's been to this one yet.
[15:59.920 --> 16:00.400]  Who do we buy?
[16:01.200 --> 16:01.700]  I got it.
[16:02.480 --> 16:03.780]  I'm going to buy Cluster Strike.
[16:03.940 --> 16:05.480]  I'm going to buy a gas mask.
[16:05.660 --> 16:06.740]  I'm going to gas mask.
[16:06.940 --> 16:09.280]  Alright, I'm coming back. I'm going to win.
[16:09.680 --> 16:10.960]  This one's for you, Marks the Frog.
[16:12.360 --> 16:15.440]  Eric, if you land over here, there's some unlooted crap.
[16:15.720 --> 16:16.480]  Where's over here?
[16:17.120 --> 16:18.840]  I pinged it. It's green.
[16:19.280 --> 16:20.440]  You're green? Okay, it's green.
[16:20.440 --> 16:21.240]  Okay, I see it.
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.000]  I got outnumbered by a Terminator and somebody else.
[16:31.340 --> 16:32.060]  Who's got money?
[16:32.400 --> 16:33.020]  Are you dead, Andrew?
[16:33.740 --> 16:35.380]  I'm so dead. I'm going into the gulag.
[16:35.860 --> 16:36.720]  Alright, let's see how he does.
[16:36.980 --> 16:37.180]  I'm here.
[16:37.640 --> 16:38.460]  Oh, I'm going to die.
[16:40.940 --> 16:42.300]  I'm going to use the Cluster Strike on that.
[16:42.600 --> 16:43.060]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.380]  Oh no, I did it on the... oh no.
[16:44.860 --> 16:46.780]  Bad aim, bad aim, bad aim, bad aim.
[16:46.880 --> 16:47.460]  Where'd you put it?
[16:47.500 --> 16:48.020]  Is it on us?
[16:48.060 --> 16:48.760]  I put it on top of me.
[16:49.340 --> 16:49.660]  No!
[16:49.940 --> 16:51.420]  It clipped the truck in front of me.
[16:51.460 --> 16:53.680]  It clipped the truck in front of me. Don't be where I am. Be where I was.
[16:53.680 --> 16:54.500]  I'm where you are.
[16:54.860 --> 16:56.120]  Be where I am now, not where I was.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.320]  I'm just going to wait in the building.
[16:58.800 --> 16:59.600]  Yeah, that could have gone better.
[17:00.180 --> 17:01.300]  There we go, Cluster Strike on the...
[17:01.300 --> 17:01.820]  I think you nailed it.
[17:02.060 --> 17:02.900]  Cluster Strike on the truck.
[17:03.340 --> 17:05.060]  Oh shit, there's a Cypher looking right at me.
[17:05.800 --> 17:07.060]  Just look and look back, dude.
[17:07.420 --> 17:07.740]  Yeah.
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.220]  He's going in.
[17:09.360 --> 17:10.000]  Oh no.
[17:11.180 --> 17:12.000]  Give him the business.
[17:12.420 --> 17:13.060]  Give him the business.
[17:13.360 --> 17:14.280]  Yep, I'm getting pinged.
[17:14.680 --> 17:15.360]  I see that.
[17:17.080 --> 17:18.360]  I pinged the dude over there.
[17:18.360 --> 17:20.500]  Alright, I've knocked their armor on two of them.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.120]  Nice.
[17:22.020 --> 17:25.680]  I was in a gulag against John Wick. I had no fucking chance.
[17:25.700 --> 17:26.180]  Yeah, you were dumb.
[17:26.180 --> 17:27.080]  Why did we even do that?
[17:27.280 --> 17:28.560]  Yeah, you were dumb before it even started.
[17:29.480 --> 17:31.800]  The only way you were going to come out of that? If you were the ballerina.
[17:31.900 --> 17:33.220]  I'm sort of pinned down.
[17:33.320 --> 17:34.680]  Oh, here comes the truck.
[17:35.300 --> 17:36.700]  Here comes the truck.
[17:38.500 --> 17:40.120]  Here comes the truck.
[17:40.260 --> 17:41.420]  It's after me.
[17:41.600 --> 17:42.660]  I'm going to die.
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.200]  Jack, stay alive!
[17:47.200 --> 17:48.600]  They're trying to hit me with the truck.
[17:48.740 --> 17:50.260]  I'm going to stay alive, don't worry.
[17:50.580 --> 17:51.220]  Toro ole.
[17:51.760 --> 17:52.160]  Come on, boys.
[17:52.420 --> 17:52.860]  I threw a grenade.
[17:54.420 --> 17:54.840]  Oh.
[17:56.540 --> 17:57.200]  He's honking.
[17:57.220 --> 17:58.020]  That's who got me.
[17:58.040 --> 17:58.700]  He's honking.
[18:00.400 --> 18:01.540]  He's going to hop out.
[18:03.260 --> 18:04.440]  Is that the Terminator?
[18:08.100 --> 18:08.660]  Where is he?
[18:09.480 --> 18:10.100]  I'm down.
[18:10.900 --> 18:11.360]  Oh, God.
[18:12.940 --> 18:14.000]  I'm out. I'm coming to you.
[18:14.280 --> 18:15.020]  Oh, Geoff.
[18:15.400 --> 18:15.760]  I'm coming.
[18:15.760 --> 18:17.000]  Geoff, I'm scared.
[18:20.020 --> 18:21.900]  Dude, I got the best shot of that.
[18:22.000 --> 18:22.820]  Oh, my God.
[18:23.160 --> 18:24.580]  Oh, I got the best shot of that.
[18:24.800 --> 18:26.060]  No, I just missed him.
[18:26.200 --> 18:27.180]  I just missed him.
[18:27.200 --> 18:27.940]  He was close.
[18:28.140 --> 18:29.060]  It looked really cool.
[18:29.240 --> 18:30.360]  That would have been so cool.
[18:30.480 --> 18:30.780]  All right, Nick.
[18:30.820 --> 18:31.440]  It's all up to you.
[18:31.680 --> 18:32.380]  It's all up to you, Nick.
[18:32.940 --> 18:33.780]  You and a sniper rifle.
[18:34.540 --> 18:35.320]  It's not even a sniper.
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.660]  You got airstruck.
[18:42.660 --> 18:43.000]  God.
[18:44.420 --> 18:45.920]  That was unreal.
[18:49.600 --> 18:52.260]  That was so crazy.
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.180]  It's not even a sniper.
[18:55.680 --> 18:57.940]  The heaviest of fire.
[18:58.240 --> 19:01.160]  You got cut in half.
[19:04.200 --> 19:06.460]  Well, praise the Lord and all that.
[19:07.360 --> 19:08.020]  It's okay.
[19:08.160 --> 19:08.940]  You still got your good leg.
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.920]  Dude, that was so crazy.
[19:11.240 --> 19:12.300]  As far as an ending goes,
[19:12.300 --> 19:12.960]  I liked it.
[19:12.980 --> 19:14.640]  I don't care what anybody Eric says.
[19:14.740 --> 19:15.420]  This game is great.
[19:16.080 --> 19:17.220]  Listen, I didn't say it was a bad game.
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.020]  I just tell you I feel nothing for it.
[19:20.440 --> 19:21.440]  You laughed at that.
[19:21.600 --> 19:22.260]  You feel something?
[19:23.280 --> 19:25.260]  You getting cut in half was hilarious.
[19:26.120 --> 19:27.080]  I feel cold.
[19:27.300 --> 19:28.760]  That was crazy.
[19:29.160 --> 19:29.740]  All right, man.
[19:29.740 --> 19:30.540]  It's all up to me.
[19:30.620 --> 19:31.500]  I got this one gun.
[19:31.600 --> 19:32.300]  No, never mind.
[19:33.100 --> 19:34.460]  Over before it began.
[19:35.080 --> 19:36.100]  Prepare to fight.
[19:36.320 --> 19:37.120]  I'm fucking prepared.
[19:37.280 --> 19:37.920]  Let me fight already.
[19:37.920 --> 19:40.240]  Yeah, they really don't want to let you fight, dude.
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.520]  I'm just running around the upstairs area waiting for an opponent.
[19:44.700 --> 19:44.960]  Yeah.
[19:45.080 --> 19:45.840]  Says Geoff.
[19:46.840 --> 19:47.980]  We can't fight each other, Nick.
[19:49.100 --> 19:50.160]  That movie good.
[19:50.680 --> 19:50.880]  What?
[19:51.120 --> 19:52.040]  We can't fight each other, Nick?
[19:52.300 --> 19:52.620]  Waiting.
[19:53.080 --> 19:53.340]  Oh.
[19:53.960 --> 19:54.200]  Waiting?
[19:54.800 --> 19:58.520]  I mean, like, probably in like 2006, but...
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.980]  Yeah, I feel like I missed it.
[20:00.340 --> 20:00.680]  Yeah, definitely.
[20:01.060 --> 20:03.100]  When I saw it, I was like, eh.
[20:03.360 --> 20:04.360]  Ryan Reynolds movie, right?
[20:04.560 --> 20:04.840]  Yeah.
[20:05.140 --> 20:05.520]  It was.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.340]  No, I never saw it.
[20:06.400 --> 20:08.340]  Justin Long and all that stuff.
[20:09.840 --> 20:16.320]  Definitely, it was great at a time when you and your friends all worked in like shitty food service.
[20:16.940 --> 20:17.680]  Oh, Geoff won!
[20:18.200 --> 20:18.580]  Yeah, I won.
[20:18.720 --> 20:19.080]  Chef!
[20:19.200 --> 20:19.720]  Way to go, buddy.
[20:19.800 --> 20:20.080]  I won too.
[20:21.200 --> 20:21.640]  You won too, Nick.
[20:21.640 --> 20:23.960]  Despite the leg, I forgot that he actually plays this.
[20:24.120 --> 20:25.820]  Oh my god, you guys are back to back right here.
[20:25.880 --> 20:26.340]  Look at it.
[20:26.820 --> 20:27.520]  Look at us go.
[20:27.700 --> 20:29.200]  Alright, let's deploy and figure out where the hell we're going.
[20:29.260 --> 20:30.760]  Dude, spawning in with your team is huge.
[20:31.140 --> 20:31.660]  Yeah, straight down.
[20:31.680 --> 20:31.880]  Straight down.
[20:32.600 --> 20:32.920]  Yeah.
[20:33.580 --> 20:34.300]  There's a car.
[20:35.980 --> 20:38.760]  I'm just gonna see what this building has to offer.
[20:39.680 --> 20:42.300]  You wanna spectate Nick or Geoff?
[20:43.280 --> 20:43.740]  Which one are you feeling?
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.320]  I want Geoff.
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.840]  Me too, I'm gonna go to Nick.
[20:47.000 --> 20:47.640]  So, yeah.
[20:48.080 --> 20:49.720]  I'll enjoy these laggy frames.
[20:49.980 --> 20:50.820]  Oh, Geoff.
[20:51.200 --> 20:52.000]  Who are you lagging?
[20:52.280 --> 20:53.740]  I know, that's what I'm saying, man.
[20:54.040 --> 20:55.160]  Maybe I just need to rebuild my Xbox.
[20:55.560 --> 20:57.140]  That couch looks so comfortable.
[20:57.440 --> 20:57.640]  That's bad.
[20:57.800 --> 20:59.700]  I'll run a speed test after.
[21:00.220 --> 21:01.000]  Oh, done.
[21:01.280 --> 21:02.640]  Can you go back and look at that couch for a minute?
[21:02.700 --> 21:04.040]  Oh, that looks so nice.
[21:04.040 --> 21:06.260]  Dude, if I were playing...
[21:06.260 --> 21:07.580]  You sound like J.D. Vance right now.
[21:09.100 --> 21:12.140]  I would be shooting this motherfucker up right now if this was Prop Hunt.
[21:12.200 --> 21:13.420]  It looks so out of place.
[21:13.720 --> 21:14.420]  It sure does.
[21:15.200 --> 21:16.780]  Is sniper your default, Nick?
[21:16.800 --> 21:17.920]  Like, is that what you try to go to?
[21:18.040 --> 21:19.720]  Nah, I just like to have a second one.
[21:19.860 --> 21:21.220]  Like, that is my secondary weapon usually.
[21:21.240 --> 21:21.800]  Got it.
[21:22.740 --> 21:23.220]  Oh, blue.
[21:23.680 --> 21:24.260]  That's something.
[21:24.420 --> 21:24.920]  Yeah, blue good.
[21:25.000 --> 21:25.480]  Little cypher.
[21:25.620 --> 21:26.180]  Blue good.
[21:26.460 --> 21:27.040]  Blue good.
[21:27.700 --> 21:28.200]  Blue chew.
[21:28.360 --> 21:28.780]  Blue chew.
[21:29.940 --> 21:32.480]  This fucking lag is doing me in.
[21:35.140 --> 21:37.560]  The lag with you climbing a ladder was hilarious.
[21:37.560 --> 21:41.600]  The sounds of what came...
[21:41.600 --> 21:42.160]  Nice.
[21:43.340 --> 21:43.700]  Cache.
[21:44.360 --> 21:45.140]  Oh, you got a cache.
[21:45.220 --> 21:45.780]  You're left, Geoff.
[21:48.400 --> 21:53.100]  I feel like you and Geoff should probably stick together, but I like the mode of just kind of do whatever you want.
[21:54.500 --> 21:56.220]  Oh, he's getting shot at from...
[21:56.220 --> 21:57.340]  Alright, well, I'm going to stay where I am.
[21:58.620 --> 21:59.940]  Sniper to your right, Geoff.
[22:00.100 --> 22:00.660]  Yeah, I see him.
[22:01.440 --> 22:01.640]  Okay.
[22:01.640 --> 22:03.780]  Oh, Nick is almost in the new zone.
[22:04.000 --> 22:04.900]  He saw me too.
[22:05.220 --> 22:06.620]  Sniper to your left, Geoff.
[22:06.880 --> 22:08.500]  Yeah, I didn't see him.
[22:08.660 --> 22:09.640]  Sniper to my left got me.
[22:10.980 --> 22:12.800]  Alright, so it's up to Nick.
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.940]  I'm going to Geoff.
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.080]  I'm calling to you, man.
[22:15.200 --> 22:15.500]  I'm going to Geoff.
[22:15.520 --> 22:16.600]  Nick can get him, potentially.
[22:16.760 --> 22:17.000]  Okay.
[22:17.040 --> 22:17.480]  I'm going to get him.
[22:17.700 --> 22:19.020]  Okay, Nick can't get him, potentially.
[22:19.080 --> 22:19.460]  Nope, he's dead.
[22:19.480 --> 22:20.020]  He flew over.
[22:21.500 --> 22:22.380]  Finish what he started.
[22:22.960 --> 22:23.400]  Oh, money.
[22:23.540 --> 22:23.720]  Okay.
[22:24.380 --> 22:24.660]  Buy a box.
[22:24.660 --> 22:25.140]  Go get...
[22:25.140 --> 22:25.760]  Yeah, go buy...
[22:25.760 --> 22:26.320]  No pressure.
[22:26.960 --> 22:30.520]  I think you're crushing it right here, bud.
[22:30.520 --> 22:31.520]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[22:32.020 --> 22:33.760]  Going outside the circle a little bit.
[22:34.120 --> 22:34.440]  You're fine.
[22:34.700 --> 22:34.840]  Okay.
[22:35.340 --> 22:35.880]  It's good, you're going...
[22:35.880 --> 22:36.780]  And I'll buy back.
[22:36.880 --> 22:37.700]  I'm just going to buy it randomly.
[22:38.280 --> 22:38.800]  Oh, shit, sniper!
[22:39.600 --> 22:40.100]  Oh, shit.
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.020]  I saw that too.
[22:41.820 --> 22:42.340]  Yeah, alright.
[22:42.500 --> 22:43.040]  Let's try that again.
[22:46.760 --> 22:47.880]  Well, I made it.
[22:48.340 --> 22:49.020]  Maybe I can...
[22:49.020 --> 22:52.800]  It must just be my Xbox, because I'm getting a sustained, like, 970 down.
[22:53.700 --> 22:54.060]  That's...
[22:54.060 --> 22:55.040]  That's not enough.
[22:55.900 --> 22:57.140]  Where is the fucking thing?
[22:57.660 --> 22:58.080]  Is it in there?
[22:58.080 --> 22:58.700]  Oh, it's outside.
[22:58.980 --> 22:59.340]  Balls.
[22:59.340 --> 22:59.860]  Oh, is it?
[23:00.000 --> 23:00.300]  The truck.
[23:00.420 --> 23:01.180]  I'll use the truck.
[23:01.300 --> 23:01.700]  There you go.
[23:01.800 --> 23:03.260]  You can buy one of his back, can't you?
[23:03.520 --> 23:04.140]  Oh, my God, please.
[23:04.260 --> 23:08.520]  Yeah, but there's a sniper aiming at it, so if I use this to defend me...
[23:08.820 --> 23:09.200]  There you go.
[23:09.800 --> 23:10.720]  There you go.
[23:11.160 --> 23:11.420]  There you go.
[23:14.440 --> 23:15.160]  This is...
[23:15.160 --> 23:21.260]  This is the funniest video, because every time it's Nick's turn to step up, it's not even
[23:21.260 --> 23:21.840]  his fault.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.120]  It's just the craziest thing you've ever seen happens.
[23:25.520 --> 23:26.640]  I was a victim of suicide.
[23:27.360 --> 23:28.500]  Dude, you were locked in.
[23:28.500 --> 23:29.680]  That was such a good strategy.
[23:29.800 --> 23:30.380]  That was awesome.
[23:31.440 --> 23:32.320]  Look at that, guys.
[23:32.460 --> 23:33.700]  I was the pacifist.
[23:33.800 --> 23:34.520]  I abstained.
[23:34.640 --> 23:35.880]  I abstained from violence.
[23:36.020 --> 23:36.500]  Isn't that incredible?
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.960]  Lock up six.
[23:38.280 --> 23:39.240]  XP boost active.
[23:39.540 --> 23:41.380]  Oh, I have an XP boost active also.
[23:42.120 --> 23:42.500]  Crazy.
[23:42.680 --> 23:43.920]  I'm doing double XP, baby.
[23:44.780 --> 23:46.680]  I haven't even ordered Little Caesars recently.
[23:47.000 --> 23:47.760]  How did I get it?
[23:47.760 --> 23:48.900]  Whoa, you're going Cheezer Cheezers?
[23:49.020 --> 23:49.620]  Oh, baby.
[23:49.900 --> 23:50.540]  Cheezer Cheezers.
[23:50.540 --> 23:51.580]  Yeah, and Crazy Puffs.
[23:53.880 --> 24:00.320]  We had the pretzel crust pizza that came back, and it's just really salty.
[24:00.560 --> 24:01.980]  Like, it's just such a salty pizza.
[24:03.340 --> 24:07.280]  But the stuffed pretzel crust is really good.
[24:09.200 --> 24:11.900]  Did not think it was going to be good.
[24:11.980 --> 24:12.420]  It's great.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.440]  I really enjoyed it.
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.480]  I like the base one, but I recognize I'm just a salt monster.
[24:18.820 --> 24:20.000]  Give me all the salt.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.480]  It's definitely very, very salty.
[24:25.420 --> 24:29.300]  But that pretzel... ours was so undercooked.
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.440]  I'll put a picture.
[24:31.340 --> 24:32.600]  You have to see this.
[24:32.760 --> 24:34.540]  It's like Gracie holding this pizza up.
[24:34.760 --> 24:39.900]  Dude, I couldn't believe that we ate it, but also there was no way we were not going to.
[24:41.260 --> 24:42.860]  It was so undercooked.
[24:43.040 --> 24:44.060]  It was so undercooked.
[24:44.060 --> 24:50.380]  And then the pretzel crust on the outside was good because it had the right amount of cheese in it and all that stuff.
[24:50.480 --> 24:56.700]  Usually stuffed crust is pretty disappointing, but this was really good.
[24:57.500 --> 24:58.440]  Okay, there we go.
[24:59.220 --> 25:00.140]  Look at this.
[25:00.260 --> 25:01.220]  Look at this picture.
[25:01.800 --> 25:02.780]  Look at this fucking pizza.
[25:02.780 --> 25:03.180]  Oh my god.
[25:03.940 --> 25:05.600]  Gracie could not believe it.
[25:05.620 --> 25:06.740]  Oh my god.
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.040]  Yeah, it was fucking crazy.
[25:09.080 --> 25:09.880]  That's fucked.
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.240]  Yeah, and then also somebody sent her a bike horn.
[25:16.080 --> 25:24.800]  It was so good that we recorded before she got that gift because that would have been bad.
[25:24.980 --> 25:26.680]  The whole episode would have been so fucked.
[25:27.100 --> 25:28.000]  It would have been so fucked.
[25:28.180 --> 25:29.020]  We got so lucky.
[25:29.060 --> 25:29.840]  We got really lucky.
[25:31.780 --> 25:32.700]  It was so loud.
[25:33.000 --> 25:34.220]  Dude, it was so loud.
[25:34.280 --> 25:34.920]  It was so funny.
[25:35.660 --> 25:37.520]  I watched Flight Risk last night.
[25:37.520 --> 25:38.300]  Did you really?
[25:38.300 --> 25:39.080]  How bad it was.
[25:39.480 --> 25:41.520]  That was on a streaming platform I have.
[25:42.000 --> 25:42.880]  Is it so bad?
[25:44.100 --> 25:45.580]  It's not even really fun bad.
[25:45.640 --> 25:46.660]  Yeah, that's the worst.
[25:46.780 --> 25:47.080]  But it was very bad.
[25:47.180 --> 25:48.120]  Yeah, that's the worst kind.
[25:48.280 --> 25:48.820]  That's Craven.
[25:48.920 --> 25:49.860]  Craven the Hunter was that.
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.740]  At least it's not as long as Craven.
[25:52.900 --> 25:54.020]  It's like a 90-minute movie.
[25:54.180 --> 25:55.060]  Well, that's fine.
[25:55.680 --> 25:58.220]  We were talking about it when I did the Mega64 podcast.
[25:58.320 --> 26:01.500]  We were talking about movie lengths or whatever.
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.400]  Sometimes you get a three-hour movie and at least there's an idea of, dude, you know what?
[26:06.420 --> 26:07.380]  Maybe they have to earn this.
[26:07.380 --> 26:10.380]  Maybe this is going to be three hours and it's going to be something they really have to whatever.
[26:10.760 --> 26:15.000]  If it's a two-hour and 20-minute movie, it's probably like automatically it's probably bad.
[26:16.720 --> 26:18.560]  Like off the rip, it's probably just bad.
[26:20.340 --> 26:22.780]  I didn't realize that Mel Gibson directed Flight Risk.
[26:22.940 --> 26:23.340]  What?
[26:23.600 --> 26:24.120]  After I watched it.
[26:24.300 --> 26:25.120]  Did he really?
[26:25.780 --> 26:27.920]  I noticed he was a producer in the end credits.
[26:28.020 --> 26:30.960]  And then when I went to look up the IMDB for it, yeah, he's the director.
[26:31.160 --> 26:32.240]  I'd never heard.
[26:33.020 --> 26:35.060]  I'd never even heard that he directed it.
[26:35.240 --> 26:35.740]  That's crazy.
[26:35.740 --> 26:39.300]  It has some of the weirdest bad CG I've ever seen.
[26:39.700 --> 26:39.740]  Really?
[26:40.040 --> 26:45.280]  Like one of the like tip-offs that he's not Mark Wahlberg isn't who he says he is.
[26:45.340 --> 26:46.660]  Is he a blood all over him?
[26:46.820 --> 26:46.940]  Yeah.
[26:47.120 --> 26:53.600]  But they CG'd the blood on his shirt and it's like not level with the shirt and it moves.
[26:53.780 --> 26:54.180]  Oh no.
[26:54.760 --> 26:56.020]  It's so bad.
[26:57.860 --> 26:58.980]  That sucks.
[27:00.940 --> 27:02.540]  Yeah, it's not good.
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.040]  It's just the fact that he wears a bald cap and it is very odd as well.
[27:08.220 --> 27:09.080]  Yeah, but I like that.
[27:11.680 --> 27:18.780]  I would like it if that's just how he looked and didn't feel like a gag when it gets revealed that he has a bald cap.
[27:19.040 --> 27:19.500]  That's pretty cool.
[27:19.580 --> 27:19.740]  Yeah.
[27:19.820 --> 27:20.080]  All right.
[27:20.080 --> 27:20.500]  That's fair.
[27:20.720 --> 27:21.360]  That's pretty fair.
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.240]  Like for some reason he's wearing both a hat and a wig.
[27:28.100 --> 27:34.680]  Like the wig falls out at the same time as they pull the hat off when it gets like it's just have him be bald.
[27:34.860 --> 27:35.460]  That's pretty funny.
[27:35.540 --> 27:36.520]  The hat covers it.
[27:36.700 --> 27:37.360]  That's pretty funny.
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.800]  I gotta say, so far so good.
[27:40.880 --> 27:43.040]  I'm not having the lag in the loading screen I was having.
[27:43.320 --> 27:43.500]  Cool.
[27:43.780 --> 27:44.240]  Oh, good.
[27:45.460 --> 27:48.180]  You know, it's bad when you can detect the lag in the loading screen.
[27:49.000 --> 27:49.360]  Oh, yeah.
[27:49.380 --> 27:54.580]  That's why I had to reboot when I was going between like scrolling down with Geoff and Eric and Johnny Caviar and Schwarzenegger.
[28:00.880 --> 28:01.760]  It was brutal.
[28:02.100 --> 28:02.840]  All right, boys.
[28:03.020 --> 28:03.640]  Another one.
[28:03.900 --> 28:04.640]  Let's do this thing.
[28:04.860 --> 28:06.020]  This is the one that we win.
[28:06.100 --> 28:06.760]  We win the whole thing.
[28:06.880 --> 28:07.280]  What if?
[28:07.480 --> 28:08.640]  What if we play this one?
[28:08.720 --> 28:10.680]  And I just go, guys, I'm addicted to this now.
[28:11.320 --> 28:12.160]  You're not going to.
[28:12.280 --> 28:12.380]  Can't stop it.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.240]  You're just teasing me.
[28:13.840 --> 28:14.640]  No, but what if?
[28:14.840 --> 28:15.640]  Think of Geoff.
[28:15.780 --> 28:16.160]  What if?
[28:16.300 --> 28:18.380]  Then we would play it all the time and make a billion videos.
[28:18.440 --> 28:19.080]  And it would be awesome.
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.100]  And we'd become known for it.
[28:20.100 --> 28:21.640]  And we'd be the world's best Warzone players.
[28:21.800 --> 28:22.880]  And we would be super rich.
[28:22.880 --> 28:24.040]  Maybe billionaires even.
[28:24.040 --> 28:25.600]  We'd be like that sketch dude.
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.480]  I don't know who that is.
[28:27.820 --> 28:32.360]  I don't either, but he's on TV commercials and he owns a $25 million house in Austin, supposedly.
[28:32.940 --> 28:33.260]  Oh, really?
[28:33.960 --> 28:34.240]  Yeah.
[28:34.680 --> 28:38.080]  Where do they build a $25 million house in Austin?
[28:38.680 --> 28:39.440]  Dude, fuck it.
[28:39.480 --> 28:43.800]  And I just saw yesterday Emma Stone's Tarrytown house is for sale for like $22 million.
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.140]  She has a Tarrytown house?
[28:45.200 --> 28:46.260]  She has a house in Tarrytown.
[28:46.500 --> 28:47.540]  It's an acre and a half.
[28:47.940 --> 28:48.020]  Damn, dude.
[28:48.020 --> 28:49.300]  You can buy it for $22 million.
[28:51.280 --> 28:53.440]  All right, where are we headed to?
[28:53.440 --> 28:53.960]  Where are we dropping?
[28:55.480 --> 28:56.300]  Andrew, what do you think?
[28:56.500 --> 28:56.740]  Geoff?
[28:57.720 --> 28:58.820]  Well, let's see the circle.
[28:59.140 --> 29:00.120]  Yeah, let's see where we are.
[29:00.120 --> 29:01.140]  Let's see what's going on there.
[29:01.260 --> 29:01.560]  It's there.
[29:01.960 --> 29:02.280]  Uh...
[29:02.280 --> 29:02.660]  Yeah.
[29:05.040 --> 29:05.680]  How about...
[29:05.680 --> 29:06.440]  How about...
[29:09.700 --> 29:10.020]  Storgetown?
[29:10.820 --> 29:11.900]  I could do Storgetown.
[29:12.020 --> 29:12.760]  I'm not crazy about the airport.
[29:13.040 --> 29:13.140]  You want to do Storgetown?
[29:13.880 --> 29:14.360]  Let's do Storgetown.
[29:14.360 --> 29:15.860]  I'm going to go to the Boneyard.
[29:16.580 --> 29:17.220]  Turn into...
[29:17.220 --> 29:18.320]  Oh, I love the vibe of that.
[29:18.560 --> 29:19.300]  ...the Boneyard.
[29:19.420 --> 29:21.060]  Oh, we can go get a scavenger there.
[29:21.160 --> 29:21.560]  Let's do it.
[29:21.860 --> 29:22.360]  Yeah, let's do it.
[29:22.360 --> 29:23.620]  I'll drop right on it.
[29:24.780 --> 29:25.220]  Uh...
[29:25.220 --> 29:26.260]  Us and all the other people.
[29:26.380 --> 29:26.680]  I'm dropping.
[29:26.820 --> 29:27.020]  Go!
[29:28.100 --> 29:30.720]  Are we going to the scavenger or the Boneyard?
[29:32.160 --> 29:32.600]  Boneyard!
[29:32.840 --> 29:33.900]  I'm going towards the scavenger.
[29:34.420 --> 29:35.580]  If we can get there first.
[29:37.080 --> 29:41.860]  Whenever I'd see the Boneyard as a name, it makes me think of like a serious XM Rock station.
[29:41.860 --> 29:42.060]  Got it.
[29:42.520 --> 29:42.980]  Hell yeah.
[29:43.220 --> 29:44.200]  That's exactly what it is.
[29:44.440 --> 29:45.200]  It's Ozzy's Boneyard.
[29:45.740 --> 29:46.760]  Oh, shit.
[29:47.040 --> 29:47.120]  Okay.
[29:47.520 --> 29:48.520]  Ken Bone's Bone Zone.
[29:50.100 --> 29:50.760]  That's different.
[29:50.760 --> 29:50.860]  Alright.
[29:52.380 --> 29:54.680]  If we go to the scavenger, maybe it's got some guns.
[29:58.800 --> 29:59.480]  Where's the guns?
[30:01.560 --> 30:03.660]  Got a gun for me here.
[30:03.860 --> 30:04.400]  Love it.
[30:04.520 --> 30:04.980]  Okay, perfect.
[30:06.500 --> 30:09.220]  I have a shotgun, so if I'm at a distance, I'm dead.
[30:09.780 --> 30:10.640]  Gun the fire shots.
[30:11.340 --> 30:15.220]  Do not engage in a gunfight when you're at a distance.
[30:16.860 --> 30:17.260]  Gunfight!
[30:17.820 --> 30:18.220]  Gunfight!
[30:18.520 --> 30:19.460]  Andrew's in a gunfight.
[30:19.460 --> 30:20.220]  Gunfight!
[30:20.840 --> 30:21.760]  I think it might be over.
[30:25.140 --> 30:26.160]  I'm in the gulag.
[30:26.320 --> 30:26.740]  Oh, he got me.
[30:28.540 --> 30:29.840]  Clearly because of lag.
[30:30.360 --> 30:32.760]  That wasn't an ability-based loss.
[30:32.860 --> 30:33.700]  For sure.
[30:34.400 --> 30:36.920]  Now, put it in the lag category.
[30:37.500 --> 30:37.760]  Definitely.
[30:43.220 --> 30:43.720]  Oh, shit.
[30:44.860 --> 30:47.180]  Oh, there's a King of the Hill dude right here.
[30:47.960 --> 30:48.660]  Which one?
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.180]  Or whatever path.
[30:51.720 --> 30:52.340]  Boom hour?
[30:53.340 --> 30:53.720]  Bobby?
[30:54.160 --> 30:54.560]  Bobby.
[30:54.760 --> 30:56.960]  Oh, I got 16 shots, baby.
[30:57.260 --> 30:58.840]  I'm excited about the new King of the Hill season.
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.260]  Me too.
[30:59.320 --> 30:59.880]  He looks great.
[31:01.060 --> 31:01.680]  That boy ain't...
[31:01.680 --> 31:01.980]  I'm dead.
[31:02.140 --> 31:02.780]  Damn, I'm down.
[31:02.800 --> 31:03.500]  Oh, I'm on fire!
[31:03.900 --> 31:04.820]  He's gonna be like,
[31:05.040 --> 31:05.380]  Fuck!
[31:05.800 --> 31:06.940]  That man ain't right.
[31:07.640 --> 31:08.320]  That's pretty good, dude.
[31:08.320 --> 31:09.060]  Bobby's not a boy anymore.
[31:09.620 --> 31:10.020]  Yeah.
[31:12.660 --> 31:13.060]  Hey!
[31:13.240 --> 31:14.300]  I see, I'm right behind Geoff.
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.060]  He's a chef.
[31:16.600 --> 31:17.280]  Geoff, turn around.
[31:19.240 --> 31:19.560]  Ah!
[31:20.620 --> 31:21.500]  Oh, you went away.
[31:21.920 --> 31:23.140]  Ooh, do I get to watch you?
[31:23.240 --> 31:24.000]  Oh, I'm watching Geoff!
[31:24.240 --> 31:24.960]  I'm watching Geoff.
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.980]  Watch me, uh...
[31:26.980 --> 31:28.340]  Oh, you can call out stuff for him.
[31:28.440 --> 31:29.240]  I threw a rock at you.
[31:29.340 --> 31:30.280]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[31:30.820 --> 31:31.400]  That's a good idea.
[31:31.540 --> 31:32.420]  Oh, he's coming in the middle!
[31:32.740 --> 31:33.680]  Right in front of you, to your right.
[31:33.820 --> 31:34.200]  There you go.
[31:34.400 --> 31:34.820]  You got him.
[31:34.900 --> 31:35.200]  Thank you.
[31:35.260 --> 31:35.560]  Good work.
[31:36.120 --> 31:37.100]  That was all because of Eric.
[31:37.920 --> 31:38.560]  Oh, redeploying.
[31:38.780 --> 31:39.400]  Way to go, boys.
[31:40.900 --> 31:41.460]  I'm waiting.
[31:41.840 --> 31:42.600]  Waiting and watching.
[31:42.760 --> 31:43.460]  Oh God, here he comes.
[31:43.940 --> 31:46.200]  Okay, I'm getting put into the gulag.
[31:46.760 --> 31:47.700]  Yep, me too.
[31:48.540 --> 31:49.360]  I'm gonna go to this, uh...
[31:50.140 --> 31:51.000]  Hampton Inns?
[31:51.040 --> 31:51.580]  What is this?
[31:52.360 --> 31:52.580]  Ow.
[31:52.980 --> 31:53.620]  Who's throwing rocks?
[31:53.680 --> 31:54.480]  Stop throwing rocks at me!
[31:56.000 --> 31:57.140]  It was Andrew.
[31:58.420 --> 31:59.220]  Is that a sniper?
[31:59.240 --> 32:00.660]  Oh, terrible shots by Eric.
[32:00.740 --> 32:01.180]  I'm out.
[32:03.520 --> 32:03.960]  Well...
[32:03.960 --> 32:05.640]  I don't know where he is, but I hear him everywhere.
[32:06.080 --> 32:06.340]  I'm...
[32:06.340 --> 32:08.760]  I'm simply not built for this game, but that's okay.
[32:09.840 --> 32:10.560]  We'll get you back.
[32:11.740 --> 32:12.600]  We'll save you.
[32:13.460 --> 32:13.900]  Oh!
[32:14.400 --> 32:14.640]  Damn.
[32:14.640 --> 32:14.980]  I'm...
[32:14.980 --> 32:17.260]  I'm really just in this for the ballerina stuff, you know?
[32:17.820 --> 32:18.220]  Ah, yeah.
[32:18.520 --> 32:20.600]  Well, you gotta live long enough for the event to start.
[32:20.900 --> 32:21.220]  Oh, yeah.
[32:21.320 --> 32:23.580]  I wonder if it's a warzone or a multiplayer, though.
[32:24.260 --> 32:24.720]  We gotta...
[32:24.720 --> 32:26.080]  We gotta find out right after this one.
[32:26.140 --> 32:26.640]  Oh, yeah.
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.920]  I'm gonna bring you guys back.
[32:31.540 --> 32:32.320]  Are we, uh...
[32:32.320 --> 32:33.340]  After this, uh...
[32:33.340 --> 32:36.060]  Regulation gameplay let's play, are we doing Sea of Thieves?
[32:36.240 --> 32:36.540]  Is that right?
[32:36.540 --> 32:37.060]  I would love to.
[32:37.900 --> 32:38.440]  Hell yeah.
[32:38.700 --> 32:40.340]  I have it installed and updated and everything.
[32:40.480 --> 32:41.160]  Let's fucking do it.
[32:41.160 --> 32:42.520]  I bet there's no lag in that game.
[32:44.340 --> 32:44.780]  Um...
[32:44.780 --> 32:45.000]  Yeah, maybe.
[32:45.100 --> 32:46.120]  I might be in for a rude awakening.
[32:46.120 --> 32:47.400]  Oh, Geoff, your lag sucks.
[32:47.980 --> 32:48.700]  Thanks, man.
[32:50.760 --> 32:51.200]  Brutal.
[32:51.560 --> 32:52.140]  It's like...
[32:52.140 --> 32:52.300]  Yeah.
[32:52.940 --> 32:53.760]  I'm familiar.
[32:54.120 --> 32:55.620]  How are you able to do this?
[32:55.760 --> 32:56.660]  Oh, my God.
[32:56.740 --> 32:58.620]  We killed somebody to do all this today.
[32:59.260 --> 33:00.440]  That's insane.
[33:00.740 --> 33:01.360]  I know.
[33:02.020 --> 33:02.640]  How is...
[33:02.640 --> 33:02.980]  How...
[33:02.980 --> 33:03.780]  Dude, this is brutal.
[33:03.920 --> 33:04.640]  Oh, fuck.
[33:05.040 --> 33:06.260]  I'm making them trouble.
[33:06.380 --> 33:07.640]  I'm making the most out of it.
[33:07.680 --> 33:08.080]  That's what I'm doing.
[33:08.080 --> 33:09.040]  Yeah, you're doing great.
[33:09.960 --> 33:10.520]  Give me a panel.
[33:10.680 --> 33:11.380]  Give me armor.
[33:11.380 --> 33:12.260]  Give me anything.
[33:13.460 --> 33:14.020]  There you go.
[33:14.080 --> 33:14.620]  Armor up, Geoff.
[33:17.200 --> 33:18.340]  Alright, I'm watching Andrew.
[33:18.760 --> 33:19.580]  Oh, fuck.
[33:19.660 --> 33:20.540]  Now I'm being tracked.
[33:20.760 --> 33:21.440]  I'm watching Geoff.
[33:22.120 --> 33:24.320]  Well, now you can at least know if you're in danger or not.
[33:26.140 --> 33:26.500]  Sure.
[33:27.000 --> 33:28.040]  Bright side of life, Andrew.
[33:28.460 --> 33:29.760]  Yeah, I appreciate it, Nick.
[33:29.820 --> 33:30.620]  I like that.
[33:31.880 --> 33:33.080]  Or maybe the bright side of death.
[33:33.180 --> 33:33.520]  I don't know.
[33:34.120 --> 33:36.820]  Well, I preferred the other way, but...
[33:36.820 --> 33:37.020]  Whatever.
[33:37.440 --> 33:38.460]  Bring you guys back.
[33:38.520 --> 33:39.180]  Ooh, what's that?
[33:39.320 --> 33:39.460]  A gunny.
[33:40.300 --> 33:41.900]  Oh, it just lets you know if guys are around you?
[33:42.940 --> 33:43.820]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.920]  It pings if there's a hot guy around me, so I know I can get ready.
[33:48.080 --> 33:49.260]  Hot guys in your area?
[33:49.440 --> 33:50.080]  That's awesome.
[33:51.680 --> 33:52.900]  Talk about a heartbeat monitor.
[33:59.840 --> 34:00.200]  Wait!
[34:00.640 --> 34:01.540]  You passed a box, I think.
[34:02.100 --> 34:02.540]  Are you blue, Andrew?
[34:02.540 --> 34:03.060]  Yeah, I know I did.
[34:03.540 --> 34:03.720]  Okay.
[34:03.940 --> 34:05.480]  Yeah, that's him.
[34:05.920 --> 34:07.320]  But you need plates.
[34:07.560 --> 34:07.820]  Fuck.
[34:10.260 --> 34:10.620]  Fuck.
[34:10.620 --> 34:11.820]  And you also need money.
[34:11.900 --> 34:12.500]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[34:12.980 --> 34:13.780]  But you also need money.
[34:14.480 --> 34:16.340]  And you could've opened that box for both those things.
[34:17.980 --> 34:18.660]  Yeah, do that.
[34:19.060 --> 34:20.080]  Don't shoot at me, don't shoot at me.
[34:21.940 --> 34:22.920]  Oh, yeah, get the car.
[34:22.920 --> 34:24.300]  Listen to Nick, he knows what he's talking about.
[34:24.300 --> 34:24.580]  Ah!
[34:24.860 --> 34:25.020]  Ah!
[34:25.940 --> 34:27.060]  Are you talking about the dead guy?
[34:27.660 --> 34:29.040]  Oh, they're just on the roof waiting.
[34:29.980 --> 34:31.460]  Oh, and then two guys are chasing you.
[34:31.460 --> 34:31.660]  Oh, and then two guys are chasing you.
[34:31.680 --> 34:32.500]  They come avenge your death.
[34:32.580 --> 34:33.980]  What roof are we talking about here?
[34:34.480 --> 34:35.220]  Uh, this one.
[34:36.520 --> 34:37.720]  Hold on, I thought I pinged it.
[34:40.620 --> 34:41.480]  You're dead, can you ping?
[34:42.100 --> 34:42.260]  Yeah.
[34:42.260 --> 34:42.700]  Oh, you can.
[34:42.860 --> 34:43.460]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[34:43.680 --> 34:44.500]  You can be helpful still.
[34:44.960 --> 34:45.680]  Damn, that's crazy.
[34:46.080 --> 34:46.800]  Just over here watching.
[34:47.180 --> 34:48.900]  I'm gonna solo these guys with lag.
[34:48.940 --> 34:49.580]  Yeah, you got it, dude.
[34:49.780 --> 34:50.880]  It's only 500 meters away.
[34:51.100 --> 34:52.860]  I'm gonna use it to my advantage, the lag.
[34:55.780 --> 34:56.140]  2500.
[34:56.840 --> 34:57.700]  Buy anything with that?
[34:58.160 --> 34:59.580]  How much does it cost to buy a person back?
[34:59.980 --> 35:00.480]  I think 3,000.
[35:00.480 --> 35:01.120]  5,000?
[35:01.420 --> 35:01.760]  5,000.
[35:02.540 --> 35:03.440]  Maybe it's less.
[35:04.200 --> 35:06.180]  Maybe it's 4,000 and we're just splitting the difference.
[35:06.280 --> 35:06.740]  Yeah, I don't know.
[35:06.740 --> 35:07.780]  Maybe it's 3,750.
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.320]  Maybe it's 4,200.
[35:09.320 --> 35:10.660]  But you can find out.
[35:10.660 --> 35:11.240]  Stop here.
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.100]  Maybe it's 5,999.
[35:12.900 --> 35:15.840]  Welcome to Regulation Gameplay where we're just saying numbers.
[35:16.720 --> 35:20.240]  I think, Geoff, if you survive for 13 minutes, something happens.
[35:20.760 --> 35:21.660]  People get released.
[35:22.180 --> 35:22.660]  Antidermis?
[35:22.700 --> 35:23.260]  Do you see that?
[35:24.260 --> 35:25.860]  You had the antidermis timer?
[35:27.100 --> 35:27.800]  Oh, yeah.
[35:27.960 --> 35:30.280]  I can survive for another 13 minutes easily.
[35:30.800 --> 35:32.400]  I just don't know what that symbol means.
[35:33.600 --> 35:35.520]  It means the gulag closes, I think.
[35:36.200 --> 35:36.520]  Okay.
[35:37.060 --> 35:38.040]  That's probably it.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.260]  It'd be cool if...
[35:41.260 --> 35:42.820]  That's exactly what it means.
[35:43.040 --> 35:45.560]  If I just had a little bit more fluidity in my...
[35:45.560 --> 35:46.360]  Yeah, I hear that.
[35:47.480 --> 35:48.020]  In your step.
[35:48.740 --> 35:50.740]  The crates or his need of fluidity?
[35:53.740 --> 35:54.140]  Fluidity.
[35:55.700 --> 35:56.600]  Ooh, check the train.
[36:01.680 --> 36:02.700]  Got people to your right.
[36:06.520 --> 36:07.760]  Oh, they're looking at you.
[36:09.060 --> 36:09.740]  Maybe I'm stopping.
[36:09.740 --> 36:10.400]  I'm looking at them.
[36:10.500 --> 36:11.180]  Nope, can't go that way.
[36:11.180 --> 36:12.220]  Oh, no.
[36:13.560 --> 36:15.380]  Don't perceive me.
[36:18.320 --> 36:19.360]  Yeah, you're good.
[36:19.580 --> 36:20.920]  Oh, yeah, they're fighting each other.
[36:21.240 --> 36:21.460]  Yep.
[36:26.650 --> 36:27.790]  No hearts around.
[36:28.170 --> 36:28.570]  Ooh, perfect.
[36:29.130 --> 36:30.190]  The box Andrew ran past.
[36:31.450 --> 36:31.790]  Hello.
[36:32.370 --> 36:33.590]  It did have money in it, Andrew.
[36:34.270 --> 36:34.690]  Did.
[36:35.030 --> 36:37.290]  I'm glad I didn't open it and give it to them.
[36:39.130 --> 36:40.170]  Left it for Geoff.
[36:40.370 --> 36:41.130]  Make myself a burger.
[36:44.030 --> 36:45.070]  These guys above me?
[36:45.070 --> 36:46.110]  Is that what's going on?
[36:47.270 --> 36:48.710]  I don't know if they're still there.
[36:49.110 --> 36:50.270]  They have abandoned ship.
[36:50.870 --> 36:52.390]  They probably heard I was coming and got scared.
[36:52.510 --> 36:53.310]  Yeah, definitely.
[36:53.890 --> 36:54.830]  You guys know Geoff is coming?
[36:55.150 --> 36:56.150]  Is Geoff the ballerina?
[36:56.350 --> 36:56.870]  I heard a lot.
[37:00.730 --> 37:03.810]  Did you guys hear the lag master is on his way?
[37:07.390 --> 37:08.270]  There's another one.
[37:08.470 --> 37:09.170]  Oh, yeah, I hear it.
[37:10.390 --> 37:11.730]  Behind the counter, maybe?
[37:12.110 --> 37:12.250]  Yep.
[37:12.870 --> 37:13.490]  Oh, we're there.
[37:13.490 --> 37:14.630]  Oh, there it was.
[37:14.770 --> 37:15.050]  There it was.
[37:18.700 --> 37:19.580]  What do we got here?
[37:20.340 --> 37:21.360]  A little bit of C4.
[37:21.960 --> 37:23.380]  Yeah, some C4, some ammo.
[37:25.860 --> 37:26.860]  Blow that drop over here.
[37:28.280 --> 37:29.440]  Can I buy somebody back yet?
[37:29.540 --> 37:30.160]  No, we don't know.
[37:30.780 --> 37:34.600]  We don't know, but you can check, which the thing is right next to.
[37:35.740 --> 37:36.440]  It's in there.
[37:37.320 --> 37:39.340]  Maybe you'll find a crate along the way.
[37:40.840 --> 37:41.500]  I hear it.
[37:42.540 --> 37:42.940]  To your left.
[37:45.160 --> 37:46.340]  There's also money right there.
[37:46.340 --> 37:47.000]  There you go.
[37:48.100 --> 37:48.900]  Behind the counter?
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.300]  Yeah, in the kiosk.
[37:51.800 --> 37:52.480]  There you go.
[37:55.080 --> 37:56.120]  Oh, this is good.
[37:56.200 --> 37:57.320]  You definitely should have.
[37:57.460 --> 37:57.840]  Close.
[37:57.940 --> 37:58.500]  Close to enough.
[37:59.120 --> 37:59.820]  You got this.
[38:01.620 --> 38:03.220]  Alright, it's on the right side.
[38:04.820 --> 38:07.220]  You got a gizmo in the gang are coming back right now, baby.
[38:07.380 --> 38:07.820]  Oh, no.
[38:08.020 --> 38:08.440]  What have you done?
[38:10.480 --> 38:11.160]  Oh, dear.
[38:12.480 --> 38:12.920]  Oh, no.
[38:13.880 --> 38:15.120]  Probably bought back.
[38:15.640 --> 38:16.400]  Problem.
[38:16.860 --> 38:17.240]  What?
[38:17.700 --> 38:18.340]  Thank you.
[38:19.060 --> 38:19.960]  Thank you.
[38:20.560 --> 38:23.840]  Oh, you're a little through the little hole.
[38:24.540 --> 38:24.780]  Yeah.
[38:26.680 --> 38:28.340]  I should have done it at full speed.
[38:29.840 --> 38:31.300]  Immediately get down.
[38:31.860 --> 38:33.720]  Get down, get down.
[38:36.360 --> 38:38.780]  Get down on it.
[38:38.880 --> 38:39.880]  That's the one I heard.
[38:40.920 --> 38:41.960]  There are two crates.
[38:42.560 --> 38:43.140]  One crate.
[38:43.140 --> 38:43.700]  Two crates.
[38:44.380 --> 38:48.020]  Do you think Ana de Armas is excited for her event to start?
[38:48.300 --> 38:49.900]  Do you think she's sitting at home on her...
[38:49.900 --> 38:50.380]  Yeah.
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.700]  Yeah, she's pumped.
[38:51.940 --> 38:52.100]  Yeah.
[38:53.100 --> 38:53.880]  She's in, dude.
[38:54.220 --> 38:54.960]  She is in.
[38:55.740 --> 38:58.420]  She doesn't even use her own skin, though.
[38:58.540 --> 38:59.320]  Like, she doesn't even care.
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.260]  I guess this is the one I want.
[39:02.440 --> 39:04.300]  She uses Splinter of the Rat.
[39:04.460 --> 39:05.040]  Where the fuck did Geoff go?
[39:06.420 --> 39:07.700]  I went to my road out.
[39:07.860 --> 39:08.440]  I'm coming back.
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.840]  Ana de Armas uses the Splinter of the Rat skin.
[39:13.560 --> 39:14.480]  Oh, no!
[39:15.100 --> 39:15.520]  One-shotted.
[39:15.680 --> 39:16.360]  One-shotted.
[39:16.360 --> 39:17.120]  How did that happen?
[39:17.260 --> 39:18.380]  Keep crawling, keep crawling, keep crawling.
[39:18.380 --> 39:19.080]  Where was he?
[39:19.260 --> 39:19.660]  Keep crawling, keep crawling.
[39:20.300 --> 39:22.660]  Oh, damn it to hell.
[39:23.840 --> 39:25.460]  Mr. Watch Yourself is sniping.
[39:26.460 --> 39:28.200]  Mr. Watch Yourself, buddy.
[39:28.940 --> 39:29.420]  You're fine.
[39:29.580 --> 39:30.860]  Oh, feet, feet.
[39:32.820 --> 39:33.320]  Oh, nice.
[39:33.700 --> 39:34.060]  Good work.
[39:34.740 --> 39:35.060]  Die, bitch.
[39:35.260 --> 39:35.480]  Die.
[39:36.940 --> 39:37.400]  Oh!
[39:39.220 --> 39:39.680]  Alright.
[39:39.680 --> 39:39.880]  Alright.
[39:40.380 --> 39:44.640]  Two close games that we just played, but guys, welcome to the best part of the video, the
[39:44.640 --> 39:45.920]  Ana de Armas section.
[39:46.680 --> 39:49.540]  Welcome to the ballerina section of the video.
[39:49.740 --> 39:56.440]  This is where we will find out what Ana de Armas is or does with this game.
[39:57.280 --> 40:00.020]  Now, where do we see the Ana de Armas scene?
[40:00.460 --> 40:01.980]  We gotta leave the match with party.
[40:02.540 --> 40:02.780]  Okay.
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.940]  And then leave match with party.
[40:05.860 --> 40:07.960]  Because that's... it gave me... it asked me twice.
[40:08.180 --> 40:08.700]  That's nice.
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.220]  And then... wait.
[40:10.700 --> 40:11.040]  Okay, wait.
[40:11.120 --> 40:11.360]  Hang on.
[40:11.740 --> 40:12.600]  Then I have to go to Warzone.
[40:12.980 --> 40:13.420]  Okay.
[40:14.300 --> 40:14.560]  Oh!
[40:14.780 --> 40:16.040]  She's doing moves!
[40:16.360 --> 40:17.740]  She's doing ballerina moves!
[40:17.900 --> 40:19.160]  Do I go to... you go to event?
[40:19.620 --> 40:20.520]  Yeah, you click it.
[40:20.700 --> 40:21.520]  From the world of John Wick.
[40:21.540 --> 40:21.820]  Whoa!
[40:22.560 --> 40:25.620]  From the world of John Wick, it's Ana de Armas.
[40:27.340 --> 40:28.320]  Ana de Armas.
[40:28.780 --> 40:29.340]  This is great.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.280]  Play the game.
[40:30.520 --> 40:37.060]  Collect high table coins that drop after eliminations when opening Warzone supply caches.
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.300]  Win rewards.
[40:38.380 --> 40:42.360]  Exchange high table coins for ballerina-themed rewards in the Ultimate Assassin.
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.960]  Geoff, you have to claim all the available rewards to unlock the all-new Essex Model 07 Marksman Rifle
[40:48.960 --> 40:53.300]  and the Decora Tenebis Nunchuck Melee Blueprint.
[40:54.220 --> 40:55.240]  Yeah, I'll probably do that.
[40:55.900 --> 40:58.220]  You guys ready to do that?
[40:58.500 --> 40:59.160]  I guess so.
[40:59.580 --> 41:01.680]  I'm gonna get the legendary emote.
[41:02.120 --> 41:02.920]  So what do we...
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.240]  So how do we... so how do I... what do we do?
[41:06.240 --> 41:08.860]  Yeah, just launch into Warzone and...
[41:08.860 --> 41:09.460]  Oh, is that it?
[41:10.000 --> 41:10.920]  It's in the...
[41:11.720 --> 41:12.440]  Hang on.
[41:13.060 --> 41:14.540]  Look for the XP tokens.
[41:14.820 --> 41:15.780]  Back to the damn...
[41:15.780 --> 41:18.020]  I've promoted Geoff to party leader, I believe.
[41:18.520 --> 41:18.940]  Yay!
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.180]  Man, not enough high table coins.
[41:22.780 --> 41:22.980]  Yeah.
[41:23.260 --> 41:25.720]  Geoff, I think I made you the... I think I made you the party leader.
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.140]  Alright, I'll hit A to find a match.
[41:27.440 --> 41:28.080]  Thank you!
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.920]  I know that that part stresses you out.
[41:30.220 --> 41:31.160]  It was making me nervous.
[41:31.880 --> 41:34.960]  I got a double XP weapon token coin active.
[41:36.580 --> 41:36.980]  Wow.
[41:37.460 --> 41:40.540]  Yeah, yeah, my weapons are gonna be pretty strong after this, I think.
[41:40.960 --> 41:41.360]  Yeah.
[41:42.240 --> 41:44.720]  I think pretty much these are gonna be pretty strong.
[41:45.680 --> 41:47.200]  I like how I'm...
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.240]  Fucking desperate to play Call of Duty with you guys, and the one day I can finally play and it's unplayable for me and only me.
[41:52.740 --> 41:55.580]  Yeah, I don't know why you chose to do that. I think that's pretty ridiculous.
[41:55.800 --> 41:55.880]  Wow.
[41:56.180 --> 41:57.240]  Game's trying to teach you a lesson.
[41:57.480 --> 41:58.120]  Stop flinging.
[41:58.400 --> 42:06.060]  It's got a... just a fucking boner full of karma that it rams down my throat or up my ass any time it gets an opportunity.
[42:07.060 --> 42:07.860]  Sometimes both.
[42:08.180 --> 42:09.080]  Sometimes both.
[42:09.940 --> 42:10.740]  Meeting in the middle.
[42:11.080 --> 42:11.520]  Yeah.
[42:12.840 --> 42:17.400]  Like the universe is giving me a karma endoscopy and colonoscopy while I'm awake.
[42:17.840 --> 42:20.920]  The universe is trying to center you.
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.180]  It's just... Geoff, you need to center yourself and so we're gonna hit you from both ends.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.960]  A full-oscopy, if you will.
[42:29.580 --> 42:30.060]  Floscopy.
[42:30.620 --> 42:31.360]  Floscopy, oh.
[42:31.680 --> 42:32.860]  Can I have it in a sentence?
[42:36.060 --> 42:39.720]  Okay, so we just have to find the Anadarmus or something? What's going on?
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.500]  Open crates or kill people.
[42:41.880 --> 42:42.860]  Open crates, got it.
[42:42.980 --> 42:43.740]  Open crates, yeah.
[42:44.260 --> 42:45.600]  I'm excited. Where should we drop?
[42:46.240 --> 42:47.120]  Uh, that's a good question.
[42:47.360 --> 42:48.520]  What area has the most crates?
[42:49.260 --> 42:50.500]  It's a crate-heavy zone.
[42:50.620 --> 42:51.340]  Probably Cratetown.
[42:51.600 --> 42:52.200]  The hospital?
[42:52.700 --> 42:53.100]  Cratetown?
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.480]  It's, uh...
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.560]  It's just north of Crateville.
[42:58.080 --> 42:59.100]  Ooh, I like Crateville.
[43:00.620 --> 43:02.000]  My brain wanted you to...
[43:02.000 --> 43:03.000]  Which is, uh...
[43:03.580 --> 43:06.880]  Actually pretty close to Crate Island, which surprisingly has very little crates.
[43:08.020 --> 43:09.160]  Step one, loot.
[43:09.420 --> 43:10.220]  Step two, upgrade.
[43:10.400 --> 43:11.540]  Step three, Anadarmos.
[43:11.980 --> 43:12.420]  Yay!
[43:13.180 --> 43:14.640]  Actually, I think it's a peninsula, Geoff.
[43:15.440 --> 43:17.380]  See? It's wrong in multiple fronts.
[43:17.680 --> 43:17.840]  Yeah.
[43:19.560 --> 43:21.460]  We meant to say it's most probably actually a peninsula.
[43:22.720 --> 43:24.560]  What? Somebody already has the Anadarmus skin?
[43:25.800 --> 43:26.240]  Crazy.
[43:26.840 --> 43:27.260]  They died.
[43:31.320 --> 43:31.720]  Okay.
[43:31.720 --> 43:33.660]  Looking like, uh...
[43:33.660 --> 43:36.540]  I think Stadium will be a pretty hot spot.
[43:36.860 --> 43:37.920]  Ooh, Stadium's not bad.
[43:39.260 --> 43:40.860]  Remember when it was open to the public?
[43:41.720 --> 43:42.020]  No.
[43:42.660 --> 43:42.940]  Okay.
[43:43.400 --> 43:44.180]  They had it...
[43:44.180 --> 43:47.380]  Like, in one of the iterations of Verdansk, they had the Stadium open.
[43:47.940 --> 43:49.300]  Like, it was an open-roof Stadium.
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.480]  Oh, I do remember that, now that you're saying that.
[43:52.540 --> 43:53.280]  Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[43:56.460 --> 43:57.860]  I could have said it better.
[43:58.520 --> 44:01.940]  Yeah, referring to the roof being open as open to the public?
[44:02.180 --> 44:02.280]  Yeah.
[44:02.280 --> 44:02.720]  It was!
[44:03.060 --> 44:04.220]  I was thinking of the public.
[44:04.560 --> 44:05.320]  Parachuting in.
[44:05.660 --> 44:07.180]  It's bugs and boneless.
[44:08.060 --> 44:09.340]  And don't let me catch you.
[44:09.340 --> 44:10.520]  Don't let me catch you.
[44:11.020 --> 44:11.320]  Oh.
[44:15.200 --> 44:16.700]  Well, we could, uh...
[44:16.700 --> 44:18.300]  Could pop a little action at the Stadium.
[44:18.820 --> 44:19.620]  I think we're going Stadium.
[44:20.120 --> 44:21.120]  Seems like we're going Stadium.
[44:21.640 --> 44:22.300]  I like it.
[44:22.580 --> 44:23.200]  I like it.
[44:24.620 --> 44:25.940]  On the roof or just around?
[44:26.120 --> 44:27.500]  It's not open to the public.
[44:29.380 --> 44:31.640]  The public being us!
[44:32.240 --> 44:33.560]  Are we going around or on top?
[44:33.820 --> 44:35.780]  Well, I don't know if going on top is going to do us any good.
[44:35.980 --> 44:37.800]  It won't go around through from on top.
[44:37.840 --> 44:39.000]  I'm going to go through the front door.
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.360]  I'm going to the yellow ping.
[44:41.420 --> 44:42.420]  I'm going to the side.
[44:43.080 --> 44:44.420]  I'm going to go wherever Andrew's going.
[44:45.020 --> 44:45.620]  Oh, we should do that.
[44:46.100 --> 44:46.460]  Whoosh!
[44:47.280 --> 44:47.840]  Oh, balls.
[44:50.180 --> 44:51.100]  Let's get in here.
[44:51.760 --> 44:52.280]  Meet me, Andrew.
[44:53.220 --> 44:54.160]  Let's get it, Eric.
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.280]  I don't know who told you guys there was a game today, but there is not.
[44:59.220 --> 45:01.120]  This ticket says it's for tomorrow.
[45:01.580 --> 45:02.460]  Oh, I got a coin.
[45:02.700 --> 45:02.980]  Great.
[45:03.380 --> 45:03.960]  I got a, uh...
[45:03.960 --> 45:04.600]  Oh, that's...
[45:04.600 --> 45:05.880]  Oh, no coin in my crate.
[45:06.720 --> 45:07.860]  You got an Anadarmus coin?
[45:08.080 --> 45:08.380]  Yeah.
[45:09.120 --> 45:09.480]  Damn.
[45:09.600 --> 45:10.560]  You're the ballerina?
[45:11.140 --> 45:12.520]  I just ballerined it up.
[45:12.880 --> 45:13.100]  Yeah.
[45:16.360 --> 45:18.620]  It was comically large.
[45:19.440 --> 45:19.980]  Was it really?
[45:20.400 --> 45:20.960]  Oh, for two.
[45:20.960 --> 45:24.360]  I'm not finding a way into this stadium.
[45:24.560 --> 45:25.020]  No, me neither.
[45:25.200 --> 45:27.040]  We are really, really running around it.
[45:27.260 --> 45:27.960]  I bet you can't.
[45:28.800 --> 45:29.380]  It's not open.
[45:29.380 --> 45:30.280]  This is old-esque.
[45:30.440 --> 45:32.460]  Oh, it's truly not open to the public.
[45:32.640 --> 45:33.360]  Oh, I heard...
[45:33.360 --> 45:33.540]  A coin!
[45:33.620 --> 45:34.520]  I saw the coin!
[45:34.840 --> 45:35.060]  No!
[45:37.120 --> 45:38.120]  Who's the ballerina?
[45:39.000 --> 45:40.540]  I think I have two coins now.
[45:41.080 --> 45:41.380]  Damn.
[45:42.040 --> 45:42.880]  Double coinage.
[45:42.900 --> 45:43.180]  Did it tell you?
[45:45.560 --> 45:47.100]  Oh, for five.
[45:47.780 --> 45:48.320]  That was brutal.
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.680]  Probably somewhere on my screen that I don't see that the audience is yelling at me about.
[45:52.120 --> 45:52.880]  Hey, I got another coin.
[45:54.040 --> 45:54.560]  High table coins.
[45:54.560 --> 45:56.400]  Oh, this is so you can buy stuff.
[45:56.920 --> 45:58.100]  Ooh, do I have any more?
[45:58.480 --> 45:59.300]  Yeah, what can I buy?
[46:01.040 --> 46:02.000]  Probably not a lot.
[46:02.140 --> 46:02.320]  Armor?
[46:03.760 --> 46:04.940]  Speaking of which, have you picked up armor?
[46:05.100 --> 46:05.520]  Armor up.
[46:06.360 --> 46:06.740]  Good call.
[46:07.580 --> 46:08.640]  Man knows what he's talking about.
[46:09.580 --> 46:11.480]  I've died many a time from forgetting.
[46:12.480 --> 46:14.200]  He's died many a time from forgetting.
[46:14.780 --> 46:15.700]  Alright, Geoff, I'm with you.
[46:16.420 --> 46:18.140]  Alright, I'm just continuing to go in a circle.
[46:18.140 --> 46:20.440]  I figure at some point we'll...
[46:20.440 --> 46:22.240]  Yeah, I think this is that point.
[46:22.780 --> 46:25.780]  Yeah, there's a zipline we can go up.
[46:26.260 --> 46:26.420]  Okay.
[46:26.640 --> 46:26.840]  Oh!
[46:28.080 --> 46:28.820]  I'm gonna zip.
[46:29.200 --> 46:29.520]  I'm up.
[46:29.900 --> 46:31.120]  Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip.
[46:31.420 --> 46:31.720]  I'm gonna go.
[46:31.880 --> 46:32.480]  I think this is Nick.
[46:32.560 --> 46:33.140]  Nick, are you yellow?
[46:33.700 --> 46:34.060]  Yes.
[46:34.380 --> 46:36.040]  We were all yellow.
[46:36.860 --> 46:37.300]  I'm with you.
[46:39.520 --> 46:40.820]  I don't know if there's anything up here.
[46:41.200 --> 46:42.220]  I don't know if this is...
[46:42.220 --> 46:42.400]  Oh!
[46:43.160 --> 46:43.540]  It's all that.
[46:43.720 --> 46:44.740]  There's a dude parachuting.
[46:45.100 --> 46:45.640]  It's all that guy.
[46:46.120 --> 46:47.400]  We should jump and head somewhere else.
[46:47.400 --> 46:47.860]  Okay.
[46:47.860 --> 46:48.960]  Let's go there.
[46:49.340 --> 46:49.960]  Moving here.
[46:50.500 --> 46:50.740]  Okay.
[46:51.540 --> 46:51.980]  Wee!
[46:52.580 --> 46:56.600]  I'm gonna go check the underground parking of this place.
[46:56.780 --> 46:56.960]  Okay.
[46:57.060 --> 46:58.500]  I'm gonna go with Nick.
[46:59.600 --> 47:00.200]  I'm gonna...
[47:00.200 --> 47:01.220]  I guess I'll go with Andrew then.
[47:01.260 --> 47:02.100]  Okay, it's all locked off.
[47:02.660 --> 47:02.900]  Keep it safe.
[47:02.900 --> 47:03.420]  It's headed to you.
[47:04.200 --> 47:05.340]  Where's my coin?
[47:05.740 --> 47:06.740]  Where's the...
[47:08.200 --> 47:09.240]  Still no coins.
[47:09.520 --> 47:09.720]  This is ridiculous.
[47:09.720 --> 47:10.560]  Alright, somebody has...
[47:10.560 --> 47:11.840]  Do you use zero coinage, Andrew?
[47:12.240 --> 47:13.200]  Zero coinage?
[47:13.260 --> 47:14.280]  I've opened like nine of them.
[47:14.460 --> 47:14.940]  I feel guilty.
[47:15.420 --> 47:16.360]  People have been here.
[47:16.360 --> 47:17.320]  For sure.
[47:18.120 --> 47:19.500]  I guess we should head to them.
[47:20.300 --> 47:22.180]  But it looks like they've moved on.
[47:27.220 --> 47:28.100]  No heartbeats.
[47:29.440 --> 47:30.100]  You okay?
[47:30.800 --> 47:31.620]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:31.660 --> 47:33.040]  I just got lagged into a tree.
[47:35.020 --> 47:36.420]  It was just...
[47:36.420 --> 47:38.160]  There wasn't a tree and then it was right in my face.
[47:38.700 --> 47:40.780]  And I was like spitting out fucking pine needles.
[47:43.960 --> 47:44.620]  What's this?
[47:44.620 --> 47:45.480]  It's a stim shot.
[47:45.680 --> 47:46.100]  I'll take that.
[47:46.320 --> 47:47.200]  Definitely want that.
[47:47.880 --> 47:48.620]  Oh my god.
[47:48.760 --> 47:49.100]  Sorry.
[47:51.280 --> 47:53.940]  You being a zombie really added to the effect.
[47:54.200 --> 47:54.800]  I'm spooky.
[47:55.560 --> 47:56.460]  Yeah, let me tell you.
[47:56.500 --> 47:57.520]  You pull it off well, bud.
[47:57.840 --> 47:58.500]  I'm spooky.
[48:00.000 --> 48:01.300]  Oh, I got a coin!
[48:01.820 --> 48:03.200]  I got a Annanare moss!
[48:03.720 --> 48:04.700]  Congratulations, dude.
[48:05.020 --> 48:06.020]  Oh, thank you.
[48:06.200 --> 48:07.100]  Andrew's in the coin club.
[48:07.820 --> 48:08.380]  Coin club.
[48:13.220 --> 48:13.720]  Gunshots.
[48:14.620 --> 48:14.860]  Where?
[48:15.980 --> 48:17.380]  They were zooming past me.
[48:17.720 --> 48:18.500]  I couldn't tell from where.
[48:21.020 --> 48:22.340]  He might be in your house.
[48:22.560 --> 48:22.860]  Hold on.
[48:23.100 --> 48:23.840]  Nice wheelbarrow.
[48:28.140 --> 48:28.860]  On my way over.
[48:30.880 --> 48:31.820]  Oh, who's shooting at me?
[48:32.220 --> 48:32.400]  Oh.
[48:32.640 --> 48:33.320]  Oh, I'm fucked.
[48:34.260 --> 48:34.580]  Shit.
[48:36.320 --> 48:36.860]  Nice, Nick.
[48:37.080 --> 48:37.600]  Best of luck.
[48:37.900 --> 48:38.260]  Oh, shit.
[48:38.300 --> 48:39.700]  I wish I'd killed him when I had the...
[48:40.380 --> 48:41.220]  There's several of them.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.120]  I didn't see where he was!
[48:42.580 --> 48:43.020]  He's on the roof.
[48:43.080 --> 48:43.460]  He's on the roof.
[48:43.500 --> 48:43.960]  He's on the roof.
[48:45.480 --> 48:46.960]  He's on the roof of the house I died at.
[48:47.800 --> 48:49.460]  Oh, I'm dropping a cluster strike on him.
[48:52.140 --> 48:55.420]  If we're lucky, they'll be trying to get the one guy up that I knocked down.
[49:01.730 --> 49:04.410]  Oh, Eric, I'm going up against Quiznos Queasy.
[49:04.910 --> 49:05.730]  Oh, no!
[49:07.470 --> 49:10.110]  I'm going up against Mr. Dopey Jr.
[49:11.110 --> 49:12.150]  Mr. Dopey's his father.
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.200]  Please, Mr. Dopey's my father.
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.380]  Call me Dirt.
[49:20.640 --> 49:21.580]  Call me Dopey Jr.
[49:23.800 --> 49:25.160]  Alright, it's me and tree life.
[49:28.900 --> 49:30.080]  Alright, let's go Quiznos.
[49:34.690 --> 49:35.730]  Ah, I died.
[49:43.860 --> 49:44.660]  Oh, damn.
[49:45.320 --> 49:45.720]  Fuck!
[49:46.040 --> 49:46.800]  I made a mistake.
[49:47.580 --> 49:49.100]  Oh, I was going to be bad no matter what I did.
[49:52.940 --> 49:54.860]  I'm going to bring this all back.
[49:55.340 --> 49:55.940]  Alright, here we go.
[49:55.960 --> 49:57.100]  You watch this.
[49:57.100 --> 49:57.740]  Okay.
[50:01.420 --> 50:04.700]  I'm going to break your leg now, so when we gulag, I'll have an advantage.
[50:06.520 --> 50:07.040]  Yeah.
[50:08.500 --> 50:09.040]  Take that.
[50:09.380 --> 50:09.920]  Take that.
[50:10.360 --> 50:11.060]  Take that.
[50:11.480 --> 50:12.540]  You're weakening his calves.
[50:14.040 --> 50:15.520]  Oh, I'm just massaging him.
[50:16.040 --> 50:17.360]  He's going to be so much looser.
[50:19.220 --> 50:19.560]  No mercy.
[50:20.920 --> 50:22.080]  Oh, I got a rock too.
[50:23.900 --> 50:24.680]  Rock fight.
[50:27.100 --> 50:28.540]  You got to lead him a little bit, Andrew.
[50:29.680 --> 50:31.320]  How can you kill women and children?
[50:32.480 --> 50:33.360]  Alright, here we go.
[50:34.560 --> 50:36.100]  It's Andrew and Bull City Baby.
[50:36.440 --> 50:36.720]  Oh, he's spinning?
[50:37.000 --> 50:37.800]  I'll spin too.
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.480]  Alright, Bull City Baby, let's go.
[50:42.340 --> 50:43.100]  Andrew, you got this.
[50:43.160 --> 50:44.020]  Bring this all back right here, baby.
[50:46.560 --> 50:47.480]  This is the moment.
[50:49.240 --> 50:50.460]  Our victory begins.
[50:50.460 --> 50:51.080]  Oh, he threw a grenade.
[50:51.580 --> 50:52.260]  You're good, you're good.
[50:52.360 --> 50:52.780]  You're alright.
[50:54.100 --> 50:55.660]  It was an infective grenade.
[50:57.720 --> 50:59.400]  Go up in there and just take it, bitch.
[51:00.820 --> 51:01.560]  Oh, God.
[51:08.460 --> 51:10.060]  He just shot my feet.
[51:10.860 --> 51:12.060]  He just shot my little feet.
[51:12.280 --> 51:13.280]  Oh, my feet.
[51:14.440 --> 51:16.820]  Well, thanks for watching this mess of a Warzone video.
[51:16.960 --> 51:17.980]  Should we keep playing Warzone?
[51:18.100 --> 51:19.580]  Is that a thing that people want?
[51:19.620 --> 51:20.240]  Let us know.
[51:20.400 --> 51:22.120]  A lot of pacifists in this run.
[51:23.880 --> 51:24.780]  Rough trade, baby.
[51:24.780 --> 51:27.400]  Well, some of us will reinstall it.
[51:27.560 --> 51:28.760]  See how that goes.
[51:28.780 --> 51:29.720]  Yeah, that might be a good idea.
[51:30.100 --> 51:31.120]  That might be a good idea.
[51:31.240 --> 51:32.560]  Well, thanks for watching, guys.
[51:32.660 --> 51:33.240]  Check out the Patreon.
[51:33.520 --> 51:35.400]  Check out the Gameplay Channel.
[51:35.500 --> 51:36.780]  Check out the podcast.
[51:37.340 --> 51:39.380]  And we will see you next time.
[51:39.600 --> 51:39.700]  Bye.
[51:40.040 --> 51:40.380]  Bye.
