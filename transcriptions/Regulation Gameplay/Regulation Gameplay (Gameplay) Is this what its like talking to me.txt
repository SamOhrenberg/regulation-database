[00:00.000 --> 00:01.600]  Is this what it's like to talk to me?
[00:02.260 --> 00:02.500]  Yes.
[00:02.780 --> 00:05.660]  Lately, you've been catching yourself stopping yourself and going,
[00:05.900 --> 00:05.960]  What?
[00:07.080 --> 00:09.240]  Yeah, I'm getting dumber by the day.
[00:10.800 --> 00:12.380]  I think it's just the cat breath.
[00:15.640 --> 00:16.980]  Andrew's straight in there with the bullet.
[00:18.360 --> 00:20.340]  You guys have been spending too much time together, baby.
[00:20.760 --> 00:24.220]  I think my big thing recently is that, Andrew, you have no respect for time.
[00:24.600 --> 00:26.300]  Insane. That's an insane take.
[00:26.900 --> 00:27.760]  It's true though.
[00:27.760 --> 00:31.100]  I spent my whole weekend to make you spend less time.
[00:31.140 --> 00:32.740]  That doesn't- that's exactly right!
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.220]  You don't respect your time!
[00:34.420 --> 00:36.700]  Do you think- do you think you mean, like-
[00:37.260 --> 00:40.420]  He didn't say disrespectful of our time only.
[00:40.640 --> 00:40.800]  Yeah, but-
[00:40.800 --> 00:41.660]  Like, you understand that.
[00:41.700 --> 00:42.640]  I'm telling you to value your time.
[00:42.640 --> 00:43.980]  I assume he would only care about his time.
[00:44.240 --> 00:44.680]  No!
[00:45.000 --> 00:46.820]  No, he cares about all of our time.
[00:47.820 --> 00:48.320]  I had fun.
[00:49.520 --> 00:50.700]  Okay, well that-
[00:50.700 --> 00:52.720]  Look, you don't waste your time if you're having fun.
[00:53.040 --> 00:53.540]  I've always said that.
