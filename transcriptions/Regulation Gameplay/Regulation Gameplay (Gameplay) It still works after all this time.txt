[00:00.000 --> 00:03.120]  I wonder if the door to the sheaf's anus still works.
[00:04.320 --> 00:08.000]  This is one of the very first things we built in Minecraft.
[00:08.880 --> 00:11.020]  Yeah, all right, I'm gonna hit the switch. All right.
[00:13.620 --> 00:16.620]  Hey! We're in his ass! Oh, look at that!
[00:16.720 --> 00:20.220]  Look how... we didn't know... I mean, I still don't really know redstone, but we...
[00:20.220 --> 00:22.540]  you could tell we didn't know how the hell to make this work, so...
[00:23.060 --> 00:25.160]  you just walk into a bunch of circuitry.
[00:25.740 --> 00:27.540]  Is there a bunch of diamond boots in here?
[00:28.420 --> 00:31.780]  That must have been from something. Maybe there's a scavenger hunt or something.
[00:32.120 --> 00:32.480]  Dude.
[00:33.200 --> 00:35.860]  It's so funny. It's like... it's like visiting...
[00:36.420 --> 00:40.580]  this would be like visiting Earth after humans die... long or gone,
[00:40.800 --> 00:44.300]  and flipping a switch and it working. Being like, holy shit, all right.
