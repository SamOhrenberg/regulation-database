[00:00.500 --> 00:01.140]  We're back.
[00:01.840 --> 00:02.860]  Hello, welcome back.
[00:03.460 --> 00:04.480]  I'm hitting the button, sorry.
[00:04.560 --> 00:07.900]  I got excited. I'm playing now, so I got excited, so I started pressing buttons.
[00:08.560 --> 00:09.160]  What was that?
[00:09.160 --> 00:10.040]  What the hell did you...
[00:10.040 --> 00:11.940]  Is it free to play? Is that what we're supposed to be on?
[00:12.680 --> 00:13.540]  No, it's parties.
[00:13.820 --> 00:13.940]  Alright.
[00:14.560 --> 00:14.860]  Party.
[00:15.160 --> 00:15.280]  Party.
[00:15.280 --> 00:15.540]  It's a party.
[00:15.760 --> 00:17.840]  How do I punch in this game? Is there a punch button?
[00:18.660 --> 00:18.860]  No.
[00:19.060 --> 00:20.520]  Okay, cool. So I just... So I have this.
[00:20.700 --> 00:23.460]  A is jump, and then right trigger or X is sprint.
[00:23.540 --> 00:26.080]  None of those buttons matter, Geoff. All that matters is the Y button.
[00:26.500 --> 00:28.640]  Do we wanna... add in a little variable?
[00:29.220 --> 00:29.640]  What does that mean?
[00:29.640 --> 00:30.500]  What's a variable?
[00:30.640 --> 00:30.900]  What does that mean?
[00:31.120 --> 00:35.120]  There's tons of stuff you can change, but I usually like to turn on a little bit of buntsing.
[00:35.300 --> 00:36.120]  I love it.
[00:36.220 --> 00:37.660]  I love buntsing.
[00:38.020 --> 00:39.060]  Andrew, what's buntsing?
[00:39.500 --> 00:40.600]  That's a great question.
[00:40.820 --> 00:42.960]  I know what buntsing is.
[00:43.380 --> 00:43.740]  Okay.
[00:44.520 --> 00:46.140]  I'm basically turning off...
[00:48.180 --> 00:49.620]  I'm turning on player collision.
[00:49.960 --> 00:50.140]  Yeah.
[00:50.400 --> 00:51.360]  And then we'll be able to bunts each other.
[00:51.760 --> 00:52.560]  That's awesome.
[00:53.600 --> 00:54.040]  Okay.
[00:54.260 --> 00:55.640]  Look at how excited I am for it.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.560]  I'll see you guys in hell.
[01:00.720 --> 01:08.820]  Okay, so Eric, you've stepped up and replaced me. I was relegated, and now the future is in your hands, buddy.
[01:09.020 --> 01:09.060]  Yeah.
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.600]  Yeah, one thing with regulation gameplay, relegation is always turned on.
[01:15.860 --> 01:20.500]  Regulation, relegation. It's the way it works. It's very regulation. It's very relegated.
[01:21.020 --> 01:21.180]  Yep.
[01:22.780 --> 01:24.880]  Me and Andrew have voted. You guys have voted as well.
[01:24.900 --> 01:25.560]  Oh, shit!
[01:26.460 --> 01:28.480]  Let's see where the battle plan may be!
[01:29.080 --> 01:29.220]  Son of a bitch.
[01:29.220 --> 01:32.020]  That's right, Eric always wins. That's what I'm talking about.
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.280]  Let's do this.
[01:33.760 --> 01:33.980]  We have to kill him first.
[01:35.280 --> 01:35.740]  Coin!
[01:37.080 --> 01:38.200]  Gotta have it.
[01:38.700 --> 01:39.540]  Where's the start?
[01:39.920 --> 01:40.960]  Oh, this looks terrible.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.480]  Down, bottom left. Bottom left.
[01:44.940 --> 01:46.240]  Oh, that's gonna be interesting.
[01:46.540 --> 01:46.940]  You know what?
[01:48.240 --> 01:49.260]  Feeling good about it.
[01:49.380 --> 01:51.420]  You know what? One last chance. Jump right there.
[01:52.840 --> 01:53.560]  Oh, shit!
[01:53.560 --> 01:53.780]  Oh, my God!
[01:54.080 --> 01:54.280]  Oh, fuck!
[01:54.380 --> 01:56.160]  Oh, fuck me!
[01:56.320 --> 01:56.980]  This moves!
[01:57.080 --> 01:57.420]  No, Andrew.
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.480]  Everything moves.
[02:01.640 --> 02:04.040]  Guys, I got a little excited.
[02:04.340 --> 02:05.820]  Andrew, don't touch me.
[02:07.620 --> 02:10.660]  Andrew, you have to get him out of there. He has the coin.
[02:11.220 --> 02:12.020]  I'm trying to stop him.
[02:12.720 --> 02:13.380]  I got it!
[02:13.540 --> 02:14.740]  Oh, he got it and he's floating.
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.260]  No, he didn't!
[02:17.980 --> 02:18.940]  Oh, my God!
[02:19.240 --> 02:20.860]  Oh, my God, you're still alive.
[02:21.460 --> 02:22.760]  You're still alive.
[02:23.440 --> 02:24.620]  You're a sheep now?
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.200]  I like the legs. I like the narrow legs.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.860]  I like the legs.
[02:29.220 --> 02:31.260]  I like how squished you get, like a little cloud.
[02:31.540 --> 02:32.520]  Look at me, I'm a little cloud.
[02:32.860 --> 02:36.840]  I like that Andrew picks the character with the most delicate ankles.
[02:39.020 --> 02:40.120]  It's definitely true.
[02:41.020 --> 02:42.140]  Nice, what a win!
[02:44.500 --> 02:44.660]  Yeah!
[02:45.340 --> 02:47.020]  That's fine. Yeah, pick on the new guy. That's fine.
[02:53.770 --> 02:55.750]  How do I want to do this?
[02:55.770 --> 02:58.250]  What does the door do? Oh, I guess it just opens and you fall through.
[02:58.250 --> 02:58.850]  It opens and closes.
[02:59.790 --> 03:01.970]  Oh, my God, that fan.
[03:02.650 --> 03:04.470]  Oh, that's going to be a problem.
[03:07.230 --> 03:09.090]  I forgot which character I was for a minute.
[03:09.710 --> 03:10.050]  That was terrifying.
[03:10.170 --> 03:11.570]  Let's go. Get off me. Nick, get off me.
[03:11.770 --> 03:12.170]  Nick, let's go.
[03:13.270 --> 03:14.510]  That fucking door!
[03:14.770 --> 03:15.210]  What the fuck?
[03:16.810 --> 03:18.410]  Oh, I jumped off of you somehow.
[03:19.030 --> 03:19.550]  Get him!
[03:20.190 --> 03:20.410]  Oh!
[03:21.030 --> 03:21.430]  Dammit.
[03:22.930 --> 03:23.430]  Uh-oh.
[03:23.430 --> 03:23.450]  Oh!
[03:27.510 --> 03:28.810]  Lock it in, Nick.
[03:28.910 --> 03:29.570]  Oh, the dancing monkey.
[03:29.930 --> 03:30.850]  Look at him go.
[03:31.270 --> 03:32.150]  Look at him go.
[03:34.110 --> 03:37.530]  And then what's the dancing monkey's plan?
[03:38.770 --> 03:40.710]  Get dancing now, you fucking idiot.
[03:42.130 --> 03:45.450]  Oh, my God. A lot of points.
[03:46.410 --> 03:49.030]  I didn't know that a black hole could be attached to goo.
[03:49.630 --> 03:50.150]  It can, indeed.
[03:52.070 --> 03:53.910]  You can goo almost anything.
[03:54.550 --> 03:55.510]  It's true.
[03:59.500 --> 04:00.800]  What are we feeling here?
[04:00.880 --> 04:01.600]  What are we feeling?
[04:02.720 --> 04:03.260]  There we go.
[04:03.560 --> 04:04.680]  What the...
[04:04.680 --> 04:06.060]  It's just a death trap.
[04:06.460 --> 04:06.820]  Oh, no.
[04:07.100 --> 04:07.460]  Let's go next.
[04:07.900 --> 04:08.360]  Oh, shit.
[04:08.840 --> 04:09.320]  Nick!
[04:09.800 --> 04:10.280]  Nick!
[04:10.520 --> 04:10.920]  Oh, God.
[04:11.280 --> 04:11.520]  No!
[04:12.020 --> 04:13.800]  You stomped on my head!
[04:15.480 --> 04:16.760]  Oh, no! My head!
[04:18.140 --> 04:18.620]  Nick!
[04:20.180 --> 04:21.460]  I turned into a Sasquatch.
[04:21.460 --> 04:24.220]  I got too excited!
[04:25.940 --> 04:27.100]  Oh, that's bullshit.
[04:27.240 --> 04:28.040]  That arrow hit you.
[04:28.140 --> 04:30.060]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[04:32.240 --> 04:33.880]  We need to stop him.
[04:33.980 --> 04:35.640]  We need to flip to Gavin again.
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.760]  Flip to Gavin.
[04:39.060 --> 04:39.600]  Well...
[04:40.720 --> 04:42.160]  For God's sake, Nick.
[04:42.320 --> 04:42.840]  Pick one.
[04:47.920 --> 04:49.720]  This is a sticky coin.
[04:51.460 --> 04:52.440]  Oh, no way.
[04:53.720 --> 04:54.980]  What am I feeling here?
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.200]  I want to see what I can do.
[04:56.500 --> 05:00.030]  Oh, God.
[05:00.270 --> 05:01.530]  That's going to be problematic.
[05:01.850 --> 05:02.890]  Oh, Lord.
[05:03.370 --> 05:04.050]  Okay, Nick, let's go.
[05:04.370 --> 05:05.490]  Nick! Fuck off!
[05:05.750 --> 05:06.010]  No!
[05:06.990 --> 05:07.510]  Nick!
[05:08.450 --> 05:08.970]  Eric!
[05:10.610 --> 05:11.130]  Okay.
[05:11.930 --> 05:12.830]  Steal his coin!
[05:15.530 --> 05:16.050]  Eric.
[05:16.330 --> 05:17.370]  How did you avoid that?
[05:17.670 --> 05:19.390]  I'm dancing all the way to hell.
[05:19.390 --> 05:22.170]  It's like the dancing blocked the arrow.
[05:22.170 --> 05:23.690]  Yeah, I'm pretty powerful.
[05:23.750 --> 05:24.530]  The stick!
[05:27.530 --> 05:29.050]  I got gummed up!
[05:29.790 --> 05:30.530]  Gavin, don't!
[05:30.730 --> 05:31.150]  Gavin, don't!
[05:31.270 --> 05:32.170]  How am I going to...
[05:32.850 --> 05:33.510]  How am I...
[05:34.590 --> 05:35.490]  When do I...
[05:35.490 --> 05:36.390]  Get him, get him, get him!
[05:36.810 --> 05:37.090]  When do I...
[05:37.090 --> 05:38.010]  Gavin!
[05:38.910 --> 05:39.310]  No!
[05:43.410 --> 05:44.330]  Oh, wow.
[05:46.110 --> 05:46.370]  Gavin...
[05:48.490 --> 05:50.350]  You needed a whole new page.
[05:51.230 --> 05:52.150]  Holy shit.
[05:52.170 --> 05:56.150]  I'm just shooting you in the dick over and over again.
[05:56.150 --> 05:57.170]  It's going shmi mode, so...
[05:57.770 --> 05:59.610]  Gavin's like, yeah, he stabbed me in the dick,
[05:59.690 --> 06:02.470]  but for one frame, I had the largest cock in the world.
[06:05.310 --> 06:07.310]  Keep it going. I want to go right into the next one. Let's go.
[06:10.070 --> 06:10.410]  Iceberg.
[06:11.110 --> 06:11.450]  Iceberg.
[06:12.230 --> 06:13.550]  I wonder which will win.
[06:14.170 --> 06:14.470]  Wowie.
[06:14.650 --> 06:15.750]  How did you get over here?
[06:16.250 --> 06:18.110]  Have you guys watched Our Flag Means Death?
[06:18.810 --> 06:19.150]  Yeah.
[06:19.390 --> 06:21.150]  Dude, I just got into it. It's really good.
[06:21.150 --> 06:22.410]  Dude, it's really good.
[06:22.430 --> 06:24.290]  Really good. I'm almost done with season one.
[06:25.570 --> 06:28.130]  I haven't watched the second season, but the first season was really enjoyable.
[06:28.330 --> 06:28.790]  So funny.
[06:30.510 --> 06:31.690]  Where does the starfish go?
[06:33.070 --> 06:34.170]  Oh, start at the top left.
[06:38.080 --> 06:39.220]  This looks heinous.
[06:39.920 --> 06:40.780]  Yeah, I don't like this.
[06:41.540 --> 06:43.380]  For this one, the ship piece will move.
[06:44.460 --> 06:45.200]  Oh my god.
[06:47.180 --> 06:48.500]  We have to ride it to the end.
[06:49.540 --> 06:52.480]  Now, is that a solid wall of ice in front of you, or can you go through that?
[06:52.480 --> 06:52.740]  Nope.
[06:53.060 --> 06:53.640]  No, we go through it.
[06:53.720 --> 06:54.940]  That was terrifying.
[06:55.160 --> 06:57.180]  But it can still drop ice on you, right?
[06:58.940 --> 07:01.540]  Wait, I want to get the thing up there.
[07:02.260 --> 07:03.020]  No points.
[07:04.100 --> 07:08.180]  Well, we learned how the level works, because now you go through the ice. I get it now.
[07:08.760 --> 07:10.240]  There are things that drop...
[07:11.080 --> 07:12.960]  Damn it! I just want to...
[07:12.960 --> 07:13.200]  Alright.
[07:13.340 --> 07:13.800]  Nick, pick something.
[07:21.520 --> 07:21.980]  You know what?
[07:23.360 --> 07:24.480]  I'm going to make things difficult.
[07:27.400 --> 07:28.360]  Oh, that's a good one.
[07:28.660 --> 07:29.320]  Alright, Nick, let's go.
[07:30.400 --> 07:30.700]  Nick!
[07:33.140 --> 07:33.820]  Nick, okay, Nick.
[07:34.540 --> 07:35.820]  No, Nick, don't touch me.
[07:35.960 --> 07:36.580]  Nick, don't touch me.
[07:36.680 --> 07:36.900]  Nick!
[07:36.980 --> 07:37.320]  Don't touch me.
[07:38.100 --> 07:38.400]  No!
[07:39.020 --> 07:39.420]  Don't touch me!
[07:40.160 --> 07:40.760]  Holy shit!
[07:41.860 --> 07:43.500]  Oh, you saved me! I think you saved my life!
[07:44.520 --> 07:44.820]  Yes!
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.140]  Oh, 10 points!
[07:47.540 --> 07:49.000]  I didn't know that was there!
[07:49.640 --> 07:51.140]  First points of the day, boys!
[07:51.740 --> 07:52.540]  Give me the trap!
[07:54.020 --> 07:55.120]  Well, you're on the board, Eric.
[07:56.100 --> 07:57.060]  Yeah, baby!
[07:57.220 --> 07:57.620]  Oh, I learned.
[07:57.800 --> 07:58.800]  I thought I was home free!
[07:59.420 --> 08:01.100]  Oh shit, I think we both got that.
[08:02.920 --> 08:03.240]  Oh.
[08:03.880 --> 08:04.720]  Oh, damn it!
[08:06.300 --> 08:07.000]  You know what?
[08:09.760 --> 08:10.640]  Oh my god.
[08:11.480 --> 08:12.300]  No rest for the weary.
[08:12.660 --> 08:13.640]  I want this.
[08:13.900 --> 08:16.520]  I'm out of here.
[08:17.020 --> 08:17.200]  Oh!
[08:17.640 --> 08:18.140]  You fools!
[08:18.680 --> 08:19.280]  You fools!
[08:22.540 --> 08:23.020]  Well...
[08:23.020 --> 08:23.320]  Whoops!
[08:23.320 --> 08:23.940]  Oh!
[08:26.420 --> 08:26.940]  Oh!
[08:27.180 --> 08:27.540]  Oh!
[08:27.720 --> 08:29.660]  That is almost incredible!
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.760]  Oh my god!
[08:33.320 --> 08:34.620]  I just want the secret!
[08:34.740 --> 08:35.480]  I want a hat!
[08:35.580 --> 08:36.820]  I want to unlock a hat!
[08:38.540 --> 08:39.840]  No hats for you!
[08:40.780 --> 08:41.480]  Damn it!
[08:41.540 --> 08:42.580]  What's the fire hydrant do?
[08:43.240 --> 08:44.020]  It squirts blood.
[08:44.680 --> 08:45.420]  Okay, yes.
[08:45.560 --> 08:45.860]  Thanks, man.
[08:47.780 --> 08:48.520]  I'm here!
[08:52.420 --> 08:54.780]  This is going to be such a mess.
[08:54.940 --> 08:55.740]  I can't wait.
[08:58.140 --> 08:58.660]  Oh!
[08:59.500 --> 09:00.940]  Guys, stop pushing me!
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.620]  Oh, frickin' hell!
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.380]  Got him.
[09:07.440 --> 09:07.960]  No!
[09:10.320 --> 09:12.140]  Oh, Gab, you're home free, bud.
[09:13.040 --> 09:14.720]  How did you survive that, Eric?
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.440]  That's incredible.
[09:19.260 --> 09:20.660]  Eric unlocked a hat!
[09:20.660 --> 09:21.420]  I got goggles!
[09:21.420 --> 09:22.620]  This is goggles for Nick!
[09:23.500 --> 09:24.060]  Why?
[09:25.560 --> 09:26.120]  What?
[09:26.920 --> 09:27.860]  Thanks, man.
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.620]  That was very helpful.
[09:33.860 --> 09:34.780]  Nick, you're fuckin' dead.
[09:35.140 --> 09:36.180]  Nick, you're fuckin' dead.
[09:36.620 --> 09:41.460]  That was so good.
[09:42.120 --> 09:43.300]  What the fuck?
[09:44.360 --> 09:46.680]  Hey, I like an omnipresent threat.
[09:46.760 --> 09:47.760]  Congratulations, Nick.
[09:48.580 --> 09:49.180]  Thank you.
[09:49.360 --> 09:51.860]  I'm stoked to have glasses for a lizard.
[09:52.000 --> 09:52.380]  Shut up!
[09:52.880 --> 09:53.720]  Shut up!
[09:57.480 --> 09:58.160]  Oh, shit.
[09:58.580 --> 09:58.940]  Oh, shit!
[10:01.420 --> 10:03.160]  How do we feel about being on top of this?
[10:05.280 --> 10:06.280]  What the fuck?
[10:06.600 --> 10:07.880]  Oh, how did that not hit you?
[10:08.360 --> 10:09.140]  Oh, my God.
[10:09.640 --> 10:10.960]  Alright, Gavin, what's the plan?
[10:11.500 --> 10:12.040]  Oh, God!
[10:12.220 --> 10:13.540]  It's like an icicle thing.
[10:17.200 --> 10:17.760]  Damn it.
[10:18.040 --> 10:18.600]  Oh, man.
[10:18.660 --> 10:19.840]  How am I in second place?
[10:22.300 --> 10:23.280]  Oh, I wanted that.
[10:24.880 --> 10:26.320]  What does the dynamite do?
[10:26.620 --> 10:27.580]  It destroys stuff.
[10:27.780 --> 10:29.740]  Yeah, shut the fuck up.
[10:36.320 --> 10:37.120]  Stupid fucking...
[10:37.120 --> 10:38.000]  Where are we going next, car?
[10:38.180 --> 10:38.480]  Oh, cool.
[10:42.980 --> 10:43.540]  Whoops.
[10:44.740 --> 10:45.640]  Oh, shit!
[10:45.940 --> 10:46.280]  Black hole!
[10:46.580 --> 10:46.800]  Black hole!
[10:48.760 --> 10:50.520]  Alright, Andrew, you got this.
[10:51.140 --> 10:51.580]  No!
[10:51.840 --> 10:52.680]  Slams, done.
[10:53.460 --> 10:53.560]  Oh, so dead!
[10:53.560 --> 10:56.040]  And he's just getting beat to fucking shit.
[10:56.420 --> 10:56.720]  I'm annihilated.
[10:57.660 --> 10:59.220]  Alright, Gavin, you got this.
[10:59.620 --> 11:00.400]  I need the boat back.
[11:01.740 --> 11:02.800]  Let's go, boat!
[11:04.660 --> 11:05.240]  Take me away!
[11:05.980 --> 11:06.420]  You're low.
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.280]  Is that the way to do it?
[11:09.960 --> 11:10.440]  I don't know.
[11:13.340 --> 11:14.900]  So far, so good.
[11:15.700 --> 11:17.060]  Now, what's the plan?
[11:18.680 --> 11:19.800]  Oh, my God.
[11:20.560 --> 11:22.600]  Oh, what a jump!
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.240]  Gavin is the ultimate chicken horse.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.680]  Gavin, that was incredible.
[11:35.460 --> 11:36.800]  Congratulations, Gav.
[11:37.880 --> 11:39.100]  You deserve chicken.
[11:39.940 --> 11:40.580]  That's awesome.
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.460]  I'm so glad Nick got some goggles.
[11:42.680 --> 11:44.120]  That's so cool for him.
[11:44.300 --> 11:44.880]  Hey, I'm happy.
[11:45.580 --> 11:46.300]  I'm pretty stoked.
[11:47.020 --> 11:47.660]  Thanks, man.
[11:50.240 --> 11:51.660]  Ah, jungle temple's good.
[11:52.320 --> 11:52.800]  Yeah?
[11:52.980 --> 11:53.960]  Okay, let's do it.
[11:55.420 --> 11:56.760]  I don't have anything.
[11:56.940 --> 11:57.620]  I want a hat.
[11:58.220 --> 11:59.460]  Eric, wear Nick's goggles.
[12:00.180 --> 12:00.920]  I can't!
[12:01.160 --> 12:03.480]  I bet volcano is good, too.
[12:04.240 --> 12:06.600]  If I could lend them to you, I would, but I can't, so...
[12:06.800 --> 12:07.520]  Fuck you guys.
[12:07.580 --> 12:08.200]  We're on a windmill.
[12:09.340 --> 12:10.400]  We probably will.
[12:11.260 --> 12:15.000]  So, this one has a permanent built-in coin.
[12:15.820 --> 12:16.320]  Oh, wow.
[12:16.740 --> 12:17.100]  Okay.
[12:18.580 --> 12:19.620]  Always available.
[12:22.480 --> 12:22.800]  Oh.
[12:30.150 --> 12:31.470]  We're building for the future.
[12:33.650 --> 12:34.870]  No, that's not gonna work.
[12:41.340 --> 12:42.660]  Andrew's going for the coin.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.580]  How do I punch him?
[12:46.020 --> 12:47.160]  What is this?
[12:47.480 --> 12:48.860]  Andrew, learn what the coin does.
[12:54.040 --> 12:54.840]  Jesus Christ.
[12:55.000 --> 12:55.400]  Oh, wow.
[12:57.240 --> 12:58.980]  I almost fucked that up.
[13:00.140 --> 13:00.680]  Give him Gavin.
[13:02.320 --> 13:03.860]  Andrew dancing in the spikes.
[13:03.880 --> 13:05.500]  That was so Indiana Jones of you.
[13:05.560 --> 13:06.340]  That was very cool.
[13:06.620 --> 13:07.260]  Yeah, that was really cool.
[13:07.420 --> 13:07.500]  Wow.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.400]  Did you guys see they announced an Indiana Jones video game?
[13:12.880 --> 13:13.320]  Yeah.
[13:14.060 --> 13:15.260]  I played it when I was a kid.
[13:15.460 --> 13:16.860]  I played the Infernal Machine.
[13:18.200 --> 13:19.080]  Oh, yeah.
[13:21.420 --> 13:22.600]  Have spiders in it.
[13:22.660 --> 13:23.680]  Let's get the shit out of it.
[13:26.080 --> 13:27.240]  Nick, you're crazy.
[13:28.040 --> 13:29.200]  No, we got it.
[13:30.160 --> 13:30.920]  Got him.
[13:32.040 --> 13:32.760]  Got him.
[13:33.000 --> 13:33.440]  No!
[13:33.720 --> 13:35.040]  Fucking got him all the way.
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.300]  Got him all the way.
[13:36.400 --> 13:37.040]  Just immediate.
[13:37.380 --> 13:38.540]  Just immediate.
[13:39.400 --> 13:40.980]  Just like, what's the plan, bud?
[13:40.980 --> 13:43.980]  I hate that it's zoomed in because I'm not going to be able to see it.
[13:44.920 --> 13:46.300]  It keeps zooming in, too.
[13:49.380 --> 13:51.780]  I guess you don't have to worry about the boulder, huh?
[13:52.060 --> 13:52.440]  Yeah, you're good.
[13:54.700 --> 13:55.920]  No winners, no points.
[13:57.840 --> 13:58.800]  Oh, it sucked.
[14:01.880 --> 14:03.200]  Oh, it didn't. Let me grab it.
[14:07.210 --> 14:07.590]  Oh.
[14:08.310 --> 14:09.730]  Yeah, I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
[14:11.310 --> 14:12.610]  Oh, you're going insane.
[14:17.390 --> 14:18.030]  Hmm.
[14:18.390 --> 14:18.890]  Hmm.
[14:18.930 --> 14:20.490]  Oh, now we're talking.
[14:20.490 --> 14:21.670]  We'll get back.
[14:21.870 --> 14:22.490]  That's awesome.
[14:23.730 --> 14:24.550]  No, let me free!
[14:25.290 --> 14:25.930]  No!
[14:26.790 --> 14:27.430]  Eric!
[14:27.730 --> 14:28.990]  You murderer!
[14:29.590 --> 14:30.930]  I tried to get over it.
[14:31.370 --> 14:32.590]  Guys, what happened?
[14:33.910 --> 14:35.710]  I tried to get over it.
[14:36.170 --> 14:37.150]  You're a monster.
[14:37.890 --> 14:39.490]  You're a monster.
[14:40.930 --> 14:41.570]  Okay.
[14:41.570 --> 14:42.190]  Oh, man.
[14:42.230 --> 14:43.550]  This is going to be impossible.
[14:43.950 --> 14:45.450]  No, no, you got this. You got this.
[14:46.230 --> 14:46.890]  Oh, it's going to be great.
[14:47.070 --> 14:47.670]  You just have to be quick.
[14:47.750 --> 14:49.350]  Yeah, just drop it in, grab it, and go.
[14:50.130 --> 14:50.730]  Smash and grab.
[14:51.110 --> 14:51.690]  Okay, well.
[14:51.810 --> 14:52.130]  I can't get in.
[14:52.490 --> 14:53.150]  Well, smash and grab.
[14:53.550 --> 14:54.030]  Smash and grab.
[14:55.050 --> 14:55.830]  There you go.
[14:56.030 --> 14:56.490]  Smash and grab.
[15:01.570 --> 15:02.390]  Smash and grab.
[15:02.670 --> 15:06.310]  Oh, dear.
[15:07.010 --> 15:07.670]  Jesus Christ.
[15:08.030 --> 15:10.730]  I think we got three fans coming right up.
[15:11.230 --> 15:11.670]  No.
[15:17.460 --> 15:18.360]  Oh, no.
[15:19.420 --> 15:20.460]  No, I don't want it.
[15:21.140 --> 15:22.400]  None of us wanted it.
[15:23.080 --> 15:23.520]  No!
[15:25.420 --> 15:26.300]  Way to go, Gavin.
[15:28.660 --> 15:29.100]  Bullshit.
[15:29.780 --> 15:30.960]  I took that right in the chops.
[15:34.140 --> 15:34.980]  I think, no!
[15:35.180 --> 15:35.360]  Yes!
[15:36.400 --> 15:37.580]  Good recovery, Eric.
[15:40.100 --> 15:40.980]  I panicked!
[15:41.260 --> 15:41.880]  I panicked!
[15:42.120 --> 15:42.540]  I panicked.
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.960]  Andrew's body was in the way.
[15:47.420 --> 15:50.620]  Because of the collision, I couldn't get footing and jump.
[15:52.220 --> 15:57.720]  You can push the bodies, but because we're in line, there's a bit of lag to it.
[15:59.340 --> 16:00.460]  Fuck this.
[16:02.990 --> 16:04.310]  Oh, my punch club.
[16:04.350 --> 16:05.570]  Yes, your punching bag.
[16:06.030 --> 16:07.090]  Thank God we're free.
[16:08.570 --> 16:10.790]  I got to be able to get to the beginning.
[16:17.060 --> 16:17.980]  Where are you going to put it?
[16:18.780 --> 16:20.280]  What is the plan here, bud?
[16:20.900 --> 16:21.840]  Oh, my God.
[16:22.740 --> 16:24.620]  You're a fucking nutcase.
[16:25.520 --> 16:26.660]  It's fine, just go around.
[16:27.180 --> 16:31.120]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[16:31.320 --> 16:32.040]  That was terrifying.
[16:33.960 --> 16:34.980]  We're really doing this?
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.100]  I'm going for it.
[16:37.120 --> 16:38.560]  Oh, I can't believe that happened.
[16:39.720 --> 16:40.340]  I need a win.
[16:40.560 --> 16:42.280]  Yeah, I was going to say, I just needed the points.
[16:44.540 --> 16:45.640]  Now Gavin has to die.
[16:45.640 --> 16:46.640]  Gavin, you have to get the little coin.
[16:47.580 --> 16:48.500]  How do I get that coin?
[16:50.140 --> 16:50.920]  How do I get off this?
[16:50.920 --> 16:52.120]  How do I move from here?
[16:52.200 --> 16:53.000]  Come on, Andrew, you got it.
[16:53.080 --> 16:53.940]  I don't think I can do this.
[16:53.940 --> 16:54.740]  Andrew, okay, here you go.
[16:54.780 --> 16:55.480]  Here you go, Andrew, ready?
[16:55.720 --> 16:56.500]  Here you go, ready?
[16:57.040 --> 16:57.640]  Here you go.
[16:58.500 --> 16:59.160]  And here you go.
[16:59.160 --> 16:59.340]  Fuck.
[17:01.380 --> 17:02.180]  Andrew, there you go.
[17:02.180 --> 17:02.640]  Oh, he's got it.
[17:02.940 --> 17:03.400]  He's got it.
[17:03.460 --> 17:04.440]  No, no, no.
[17:05.600 --> 17:07.580]  Oh, no, now Gavin's going to wait it out.
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.140]  All right, let's see about that coin.
[17:12.280 --> 17:13.920]  All right, Gavin, now you can go get it.
[17:13.980 --> 17:14.600]  Now here you go.
[17:14.920 --> 17:15.420]  There you go.
[17:15.700 --> 17:16.220]  There you go.
[17:16.660 --> 17:17.560]  Ah, damn it.
[17:18.180 --> 17:19.300]  I didn't respawn.
[17:19.680 --> 17:21.160]  Zoom in even closer.
[17:21.520 --> 17:22.040]  Get the other one.
[17:22.300 --> 17:22.980]  Get both, get both.
[17:24.700 --> 17:25.380]  I don't think I can.
[17:25.400 --> 17:26.740]  I'm holding B, why won't you give up?
[17:29.260 --> 17:32.460]  Okay, just got to get off this fricking fan.
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.740]  Just got to get off the fan there.
[17:34.040 --> 17:34.900]  Just get off the fan.
[17:36.160 --> 17:36.520]  Wow.
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.740]  Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[17:42.280 --> 17:42.940]  Nice and easy.
[17:43.460 --> 17:43.860]  Bullshit.
[17:44.140 --> 17:44.700]  Easy does it.
[17:45.020 --> 17:45.200]  Wow.
[17:47.540 --> 17:48.560]  You son of a bitch.
[17:49.080 --> 17:49.160]  Congratulations, Gavin.
[17:49.160 --> 17:49.300]  Underdog.
[17:50.140 --> 17:50.940]  Here we go.
[17:52.460 --> 17:54.240]  All right, got to stop that shit from happening again.
[17:54.520 --> 17:54.760]  No!
[17:54.960 --> 17:55.140]  Fuck!
[18:06.260 --> 18:08.420]  Trying to think of all the places I've seen Gavin hang out.
[18:12.320 --> 18:13.120]  The library.
[18:16.200 --> 18:17.160]  Oh, that's good.
[18:17.360 --> 18:19.240]  Oh, wow, that's doable-gettable.
[18:20.100 --> 18:20.720]  Let's go, Andrew.
[18:21.220 --> 18:22.220]  Gavin, come on, let's go.
[18:22.220 --> 18:22.600]  Get off my ass.
[18:22.740 --> 18:23.560]  I don't trust any of y'all.
[18:27.180 --> 18:28.300]  Oh, Eric with the coin.
[18:29.600 --> 18:30.220]  I've got you.
[18:30.500 --> 18:31.480]  Holy lived.
[18:31.520 --> 18:32.600]  I'm not going to be able to make it back up.
[18:32.900 --> 18:33.500]  Yeah, you can.
[18:34.880 --> 18:35.200]  Nope.
[18:36.200 --> 18:37.440]  You really want to have-
[18:37.440 --> 18:37.680]  No!
[18:38.460 --> 18:39.440]  Couldn't quite make it there.
[18:39.520 --> 18:40.200]  Oh, my God.
[18:40.900 --> 18:41.860]  Can you get those two coins, buddy?
[18:41.860 --> 18:42.840]  Gavin, do you think we can get that?
[18:43.980 --> 18:46.020]  This moves the goddamn out of my way.
[18:47.440 --> 18:48.820]  Move, you little monkey bastard!
[18:51.140 --> 18:52.700]  I can't let you do that, Gavin.
[18:52.700 --> 18:53.300]  I can't get that.
[18:53.360 --> 18:54.240]  There's no way.
[18:54.600 --> 18:54.960]  Whoa!
[18:55.480 --> 18:57.260]  Nick, Nick, Nick, you've got to play defense.
[18:58.300 --> 18:58.660]  Yeah.
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.220]  Nick, you've got to play defense.
[19:00.500 --> 19:00.860]  You're right.
[19:03.000 --> 19:03.800]  No, Nick!
[19:04.020 --> 19:04.920]  That's not defense!
[19:05.960 --> 19:06.900]  That's good defense.
[19:07.620 --> 19:08.560]  How do I get this other coin?
[19:08.860 --> 19:09.580]  You've got to go down.
[19:09.600 --> 19:10.980]  There's no way you can get the other one.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.260]  You've got to go down all the way.
[19:13.320 --> 19:14.020]  Gotta go for greed.
[19:15.200 --> 19:15.800]  Okay, you got it.
[19:16.060 --> 19:17.040]  Right, and here you go.
[19:17.300 --> 19:18.160]  It's not going to happen.
[19:18.300 --> 19:19.040]  There's no-
[19:19.040 --> 19:19.960]  You got it, you got it, you got it.
[19:20.040 --> 19:20.800]  Get the coin, get the coin.
[19:20.920 --> 19:21.540]  You got it!
[19:22.080 --> 19:22.840]  No, die!
[19:23.920 --> 19:24.280]  What?
[19:24.620 --> 19:25.740]  No, we should be dead!
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.200]  Oh, wait, you've got to-
[19:29.620 --> 19:31.160]  Oh, that block is-
[19:31.160 --> 19:32.140]  It'll fall, though, right?
[19:32.160 --> 19:32.360]  No.
[19:34.160 --> 19:34.980]  How many-
[19:35.880 --> 19:36.240]  Yes!
[19:37.240 --> 19:38.140]  My trap works!
[19:43.540 --> 19:44.420]  I did it!
[19:44.620 --> 19:46.020]  I did it, guys, I did it!
[19:46.060 --> 19:47.660]  That was such a convoluted trap.
[19:49.500 --> 19:51.320]  I can't believe you fell for it.
[19:51.560 --> 19:53.780]  Well, I wasn't really falling for anything, was I?
[19:54.180 --> 19:55.380]  I was just trying to get down.
[19:55.520 --> 19:56.440]  You fell into the spikes.
[20:07.370 --> 20:08.290]  Oh, shit!
[20:09.370 --> 20:09.830]  What?
[20:10.170 --> 20:10.630]  No!
[20:11.430 --> 20:13.030]  What is happening?
[20:16.790 --> 20:17.870]  Gavin's trying to get here!
[20:18.030 --> 20:18.810]  Raccoon bastard!
[20:20.050 --> 20:21.570]  Gavin's trying to play defense here.
[20:22.510 --> 20:23.110]  Give me the coin.
[20:23.470 --> 20:24.270]  Give me the coin.
[20:25.330 --> 20:26.470]  Give me the coin, schmuck!
[20:30.050 --> 20:30.650]  Oh!
[20:31.950 --> 20:34.670]  Oh, what a defensive hold!
[20:35.510 --> 20:36.030]  Oh!
[20:36.610 --> 20:37.790]  What a no!
[20:40.610 --> 20:43.070]  Nick, that's how you play defense!
[20:44.570 --> 20:45.950]  I got him in the end.
[20:47.210 --> 20:48.390]  I got him in the end.
[21:00.380 --> 21:02.300]  Oh, what a tease that coin is.
[21:04.000 --> 21:04.920]  A wallet tease.
[21:05.240 --> 21:06.880]  A little wallet.
[21:11.640 --> 21:12.520]  Oh, God.
[21:13.100 --> 21:14.660]  Oh, God, no, no!
[21:15.360 --> 21:16.320]  Oh, shite!
[21:18.660 --> 21:20.620]  Oh, it's Eric's game!
[21:23.820 --> 21:24.440]  No!
[21:25.620 --> 21:25.940]  Fuck!
[21:27.260 --> 21:29.380]  Easy peasy, this is baby stuff.
[21:29.560 --> 21:30.580]  This is baby stuff.
[21:31.540 --> 21:32.960]  No, fuck no, I just need some points.
[21:34.020 --> 21:35.380]  Give me it, please.
[21:35.540 --> 21:36.420]  You'll get underdogs here.
[21:36.460 --> 21:36.480]  Oh, my God.
[21:37.000 --> 21:37.620]  Wow!
[21:38.200 --> 21:39.460]  He takes the lead!
[21:39.460 --> 21:40.980]  Worst of first.
[21:41.800 --> 21:42.360]  No!
[21:42.740 --> 21:43.340]  My weapon!
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.240]  This is Eric's game.
[21:46.540 --> 21:48.120]  You have to kill Eric.
[21:50.820 --> 21:52.360]  Oh, I like your thinking.
[21:53.320 --> 21:53.880]  Oh!
[21:55.880 --> 21:57.540]  Thanks, Nick.
[21:57.960 --> 21:58.660]  That was personal.
[21:59.020 --> 22:00.060]  I didn't blow it up.
[22:01.220 --> 22:02.540]  But I think you might be shooting it.
[22:02.600 --> 22:02.840]  No!
[22:03.120 --> 22:03.420]  No!
[22:03.800 --> 22:03.940]  No!
[22:04.160 --> 22:04.520]  Ah!
[22:04.800 --> 22:05.940]  Oh, it might be.
[22:06.520 --> 22:07.460]  Stupid camera.
[22:10.180 --> 22:11.560]  Oh, shit, Gavin.
[22:11.560 --> 22:12.360]  Get that boulder in the mix.
[22:12.700 --> 22:13.260]  Gavin!
[22:13.700 --> 22:14.640]  Can I duck this?
[22:15.380 --> 22:15.680]  Oh!
[22:16.700 --> 22:16.760]  No way!
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.760]  No way!
[22:19.480 --> 22:20.880]  For the steal!
[22:24.480 --> 22:26.620]  Why are you still alive?
[22:26.920 --> 22:27.480]  Yeah!
[22:28.920 --> 22:30.620]  How are you even meant to do that bit?
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.820]  I guess you can go up, like, left side.
[22:34.500 --> 22:34.780]  Maybe.
[22:35.460 --> 22:36.400]  Ah, shit!
[22:36.860 --> 22:38.200]  That would have been so good there!
[22:48.550 --> 22:49.610]  That's so mean.
[22:52.330 --> 22:53.570]  It's so mean.
[22:55.070 --> 22:56.350]  You just go down and get it.
[22:56.530 --> 22:57.110]  What's the big deal?
[22:57.670 --> 22:58.390]  Go grab it.
[22:58.890 --> 22:59.790]  Just go grab it.
[22:59.790 --> 23:00.390]  It's right there.
[23:00.470 --> 23:01.790]  There's a little platform and everything.
[23:04.310 --> 23:04.790]  Um...
[23:04.790 --> 23:05.330]  Oh, okay.
[23:06.710 --> 23:07.370]  Eric, get off me.
[23:07.450 --> 23:07.790]  You idiot!
[23:07.790 --> 23:09.330]  You're the one on me!
[23:09.650 --> 23:10.710]  You're on me!
[23:10.810 --> 23:11.850]  I'm not on you!
[23:12.650 --> 23:12.890]  Ah!
[23:13.430 --> 23:13.890]  No!
[23:15.390 --> 23:16.690]  Eric, you...
[23:17.290 --> 23:17.990]  Worthless fuck!
[23:20.050 --> 23:21.010]  Don't! Don't, Andrew!
[23:21.190 --> 23:21.330]  Get real low!
[23:21.690 --> 23:22.350]  Get real low!
[23:22.710 --> 23:23.510]  Oh, wow!
[23:24.150 --> 23:27.590]  Andrew, all I'm gonna say is that coin at the end, you gotta get it if you want first place here.
[23:27.590 --> 23:28.370]  I'm going for it.
[23:28.910 --> 23:30.050]  That's what I'm talking about.
[23:30.350 --> 23:31.130]  You got this, Andrew.
[23:31.710 --> 23:32.030]  You got it.
[23:32.030 --> 23:32.810]  How do I get up there?
[23:33.090 --> 23:33.310]  Now.
[23:33.750 --> 23:33.990]  Okay.
[23:34.930 --> 23:35.290]  Oh!
[23:35.650 --> 23:36.970]  Oh my god!
[23:38.030 --> 23:40.890]  Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?
[23:41.250 --> 23:41.670]  Are you ready?
[23:43.110 --> 23:43.350]  Go.
[23:43.650 --> 23:44.830]  You got it. You got it right there.
[23:45.150 --> 23:45.830]  Wait, wait, wait!
[23:45.830 --> 23:46.850]  Okay, all the way up.
[23:47.070 --> 23:47.450]  You got it.
[23:47.810 --> 23:48.470]  Okay, you got it.
[23:48.550 --> 23:50.750]  You gotta go left, then right, then up and around.
[23:50.930 --> 23:51.250]  You got it.
[23:51.450 --> 23:52.290]  This is baby stuff.
[23:52.290 --> 23:52.870]  It's pushing me!
[23:53.050 --> 23:54.090]  This is so fucking easy.
[23:54.090 --> 23:55.870]  You can do this so easily.
[23:55.870 --> 23:56.390]  There you go! There you go!
[23:56.830 --> 23:57.470]  Oh my god!
[23:57.490 --> 23:57.790]  Get the coin!
[23:58.010 --> 23:59.610]  Can I grab the thing?
[23:59.750 --> 24:00.610]  Can I stand on the ledge?
[24:00.750 --> 24:02.490]  You can stand on that ledge probably.
[24:02.630 --> 24:02.830]  Get the coin!
[24:03.050 --> 24:03.750]  Get the coin! Get the coin!
[24:05.430 --> 24:06.010]  Get it!
[24:06.090 --> 24:07.070]  He's gonna double coin this.
[24:07.370 --> 24:07.770]  Double coin!
[24:08.410 --> 24:09.130]  Double coin!
[24:11.090 --> 24:12.290]  Oh my god!
[24:12.490 --> 24:12.850]  See?
[24:13.370 --> 24:13.730]  Oh!
[24:14.470 --> 24:14.610]  Wow!
[24:16.250 --> 24:17.350]  Two turns left.
[24:18.610 --> 24:20.330]  It is anybody's game.
[24:20.670 --> 24:21.790]  Oh, damn it.
[24:22.490 --> 24:24.770]  These coins are such a game changer.
[24:30.200 --> 24:30.720]  Jesus.
[24:30.920 --> 24:31.520]  Come on, man.
[24:32.160 --> 24:32.680]  What?
[24:33.380 --> 24:34.260]  We're having fun!
[24:35.140 --> 24:35.620]  Oh, yeah.
[24:35.800 --> 24:36.520]  Play defense.
[24:38.600 --> 24:39.500]  Locked into this.
[24:39.600 --> 24:40.500]  Two turns left.
[24:41.280 --> 24:42.080]  Defense time.
[24:43.760 --> 24:44.960]  Nick is like, come on!
[24:44.980 --> 24:46.660]  And then trying to put us on our spawn.
[24:46.800 --> 24:47.820]  You're a psycho.
[24:50.080 --> 24:50.720]  Yahoo!
[24:52.680 --> 24:53.880]  Holy shit.
[24:53.880 --> 24:55.140]  Say yahoo.
[24:55.780 --> 24:56.280]  Did I?
[24:56.520 --> 24:57.600]  I'll say yahoo.
[24:58.100 --> 24:58.340]  Yahoo!
[25:01.400 --> 25:02.820]  Two can play this game.
[25:03.620 --> 25:03.940]  Fuck.
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.200]  No!
[25:05.340 --> 25:05.980]  No!
[25:06.280 --> 25:06.700]  No!
[25:07.540 --> 25:09.280]  I was racing against the clock.
[25:09.400 --> 25:10.340]  I wanted it so bad.
[25:12.800 --> 25:14.700]  I didn't even consider that.
[25:15.700 --> 25:19.300]  I just went down and punched Nick in the face.
[25:22.480 --> 25:25.840]  I know Geoff saw it, too, because he lost his fucking mind.
[25:35.170 --> 25:36.230]  That's just not...
[25:39.550 --> 25:40.030]  No!
[25:43.090 --> 25:44.610]  Come, fucking monkey. Get out of the way.
[25:45.610 --> 25:46.410]  Fucking A.
[25:47.050 --> 25:47.490]  No!
[25:48.110 --> 25:48.430]  Oh, damn.
[25:49.550 --> 25:50.350]  Dumb monkey.
[25:51.690 --> 25:52.390]  Oh, God.
[25:52.390 --> 25:53.850]  Oh, shit, Nick. You killed me, Nick.
[25:54.170 --> 25:57.150]  Oh, my God. How?
[25:58.050 --> 25:58.930]  All right.
[25:59.390 --> 26:00.390]  Nick, you got this.
[26:00.610 --> 26:02.710]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[26:02.710 --> 26:04.870]  This is going to be the win of the century if you pull this off.
[26:05.050 --> 26:05.250]  Go!
[26:05.950 --> 26:06.750]  Stop stopping!
[26:07.330 --> 26:08.390]  He slid off.
[26:09.410 --> 26:10.610]  Definitely not the win of the century.
[26:11.950 --> 26:12.370]  Victory!
[26:13.830 --> 26:15.310]  Patton with that one round.
[26:15.550 --> 26:15.930]  Wow.
[26:17.770 --> 26:18.610]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[26:18.910 --> 26:19.490]  Thank you.
[26:20.250 --> 26:21.570]  You all got one more in us?
[26:24.940 --> 26:26.180]  Oh, my God.
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.600]  Oh, holy hell.
[26:28.440 --> 26:29.720]  Did I unlock a hat yet?
[26:31.740 --> 26:32.160]  No.
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.200]  I just want a hat.
[26:36.620 --> 26:40.160]  I felt so confident in the run before that when Gavin punched me in the face.
[26:40.600 --> 26:41.120]  Oh, volcano.
[26:41.320 --> 26:41.980]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[26:42.840 --> 26:44.180]  Yeah, I'm with you, dude.
[26:45.660 --> 26:46.860]  Let's get some Dante's Peak.
[26:46.860 --> 26:47.920]  The son of a bitch.
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.360]  Look out for the melting granny.
[26:54.980 --> 26:56.000]  Oh, shit.
[26:57.060 --> 26:57.520]  Rezno.
[27:06.580 --> 27:07.100]  Interesting.
[27:07.460 --> 27:07.720]  Okay.
[27:08.180 --> 27:09.240]  I hate the sticky.
[27:09.660 --> 27:10.460]  I hate it so much.
[27:12.900 --> 27:14.140]  Oh, this is pretty bad.
[27:14.380 --> 27:15.220]  Oh, no.
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.100]  No, no!
[27:16.940 --> 27:18.380]  That was nasty.
[27:19.140 --> 27:19.560]  Yeah, go ahead.
[27:20.240 --> 27:21.340]  You guys killed me.
[27:21.780 --> 27:22.880]  Oh, piss.
[27:23.020 --> 27:23.920]  Bollocks piss.
[27:27.860 --> 27:30.280]  I fucking get off my goddamn head.
[27:30.580 --> 27:31.080]  What do you mean?
[27:32.320 --> 27:33.460]  Get up.
[27:33.980 --> 27:34.280]  No!
[27:36.280 --> 27:37.960]  I got rat cooked.
[27:38.000 --> 27:38.600]  Zoom in.
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.480]  A single sheep remains.
[27:41.860 --> 27:43.080]  One last sheep.
[27:43.120 --> 27:43.740]  Will he make it?
[27:44.840 --> 27:45.760]  He got too excited.
[27:46.040 --> 27:46.260]  What?
[27:46.580 --> 27:47.520]  Stuck on the Rezno.
[27:47.960 --> 27:48.560]  Okay.
[27:48.560 --> 27:49.560]  He's done it.
[27:49.840 --> 27:50.320]  He did it.
[27:52.500 --> 27:53.780]  Little sheep hands.
[27:57.320 --> 27:58.580]  I don't know what I grabbed.
[28:02.160 --> 28:02.940]  Come on, man.
[28:03.000 --> 28:03.740]  You can do it.
[28:04.000 --> 28:04.980]  I'm going to get some flowers.
[28:08.700 --> 28:09.500]  That is...
[28:09.500 --> 28:10.400]  God damn it, Gavin.
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.480]  There we go.
[28:12.240 --> 28:13.140]  You know, this is great.
[28:14.680 --> 28:16.020]  Oh, you're a monster.
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.800]  Put it where the cannon shoots.
[28:17.940 --> 28:19.000]  Andrew, don't do that.
[28:19.080 --> 28:19.540]  Oh, you can't.
[28:21.380 --> 28:22.860]  Oh, that's a yucky platform.
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.000]  That is a tough one.
[28:24.540 --> 28:26.820]  That's a real who's who of who's getting boned there.
[28:27.480 --> 28:28.620]  I'm just going to get out of here.
[28:28.620 --> 28:29.920]  I'm just going to get away from the rabble.
[28:31.540 --> 28:32.540]  Eric, fuck off!
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.320]  What are you talking about?
[28:34.360 --> 28:34.660]  Eric!
[28:34.980 --> 28:35.180]  Yeah?
[28:36.300 --> 28:36.880]  Get away.
[28:38.080 --> 28:38.440]  Shit!
[28:38.600 --> 28:39.720]  Oh, God.
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.200]  Alright, Andrew.
[28:42.260 --> 28:42.960]  I'll go, then you go.
[28:43.300 --> 28:44.140]  Yeah, I'm in the back.
[28:44.200 --> 28:44.760]  I'm fine waiting.
[28:45.900 --> 28:46.260]  No!
[28:46.260 --> 28:46.940]  No!
[28:48.060 --> 28:48.460]  Alright.
[28:49.500 --> 28:50.460]  Oh, my God.
[28:50.700 --> 28:51.660]  Eric almost killed me.
[28:52.200 --> 28:53.160]  I got...
[28:53.160 --> 28:56.300]  I didn't realize the barbed wire one was that one.
[28:56.360 --> 28:57.280]  I thought it was the next one.
[28:57.300 --> 28:58.040]  Yeah, it was that one.
[28:58.560 --> 28:59.360]  Oh, fuck!
[28:59.600 --> 29:00.320]  Oh, the flower!
[29:01.560 --> 29:02.040]  Oh, man.
[29:02.100 --> 29:02.660]  He almost hit me.
[29:02.760 --> 29:04.020]  Let me grab onto this lava.
[29:08.180 --> 29:09.280]  Good weapon, good weapon.
[29:10.040 --> 29:10.440]  Fuck.
[29:10.620 --> 29:10.840]  Oh.
[29:11.320 --> 29:11.720]  Platforms.
[29:13.340 --> 29:14.480]  Too early for a bomb.
[29:14.540 --> 29:15.300]  We're still building, baby.
[29:17.820 --> 29:18.200]  Okay.
[29:18.800 --> 29:19.480]  Ooh, I like it.
[29:19.500 --> 29:20.060]  I like it, Gavin.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.020]  Oh, damn it, Gavin.
[29:25.580 --> 29:26.340]  You're crazy!
[29:27.500 --> 29:28.260]  That's crazy!
[29:28.680 --> 29:29.300]  Andrew, don't.
[29:29.380 --> 29:30.060]  Andrew, don't.
[29:30.160 --> 29:30.700]  Andrew, don't.
[29:30.800 --> 29:31.400]  Don't do it.
[29:32.940 --> 29:33.500]  Do it.
[29:34.300 --> 29:35.500]  Andrew, go insane mode.
[29:38.660 --> 29:39.040]  No!
[29:39.660 --> 29:41.080]  I got rugby tackle!
[29:41.140 --> 29:41.860]  Who did that?
[29:42.020 --> 29:42.620]  I forgot!
[29:42.760 --> 29:43.440]  What was that?
[29:44.100 --> 29:44.380]  No!
[29:44.700 --> 29:45.080]  Get off me!
[29:45.080 --> 29:45.580]  Fuck off!
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.060]  Fuck off!
[29:46.120 --> 29:46.520]  That was me!
[29:46.820 --> 29:48.680]  You just barrel-rolled me off the floor.
[29:48.900 --> 29:50.520]  I forgot that it wasn't solid.
[29:51.180 --> 29:52.440]  I went to hug the wall.
[29:52.640 --> 29:52.880]  No!
[29:53.000 --> 29:53.420]  You fucker!
[29:54.840 --> 29:57.060]  I just got dive-tackled out the window.
[29:58.440 --> 29:58.880]  No!
[29:59.400 --> 29:59.660]  No!
[30:00.120 --> 30:01.780]  Oh, you're still in the neck.
[30:02.880 --> 30:05.300]  We're just mainly getting killed by each other and the level.
[30:05.560 --> 30:07.160]  We're barely touching our traps.
[30:08.280 --> 30:08.980]  Alright, here we go.
[30:09.680 --> 30:10.200]  There you go.
[30:10.340 --> 30:10.480]  Not that.
[30:11.180 --> 30:11.900]  Not that.
[30:12.860 --> 30:13.480]  Not that.
[30:14.160 --> 30:14.980]  There you go.
[30:14.980 --> 30:16.960]  That might be it.
[30:17.120 --> 30:18.180]  Oh, there you go.
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.960]  Alright, that one's okay.
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.120]  He's just hitting the button.
[30:21.640 --> 30:23.440]  He's just hitting the button so much.
[30:23.660 --> 30:25.220]  He just keeps hitting the button.
[30:25.360 --> 30:26.400]  Shut the fuck up!
[30:26.420 --> 30:27.140]  Shut the fuck up!
[30:27.360 --> 30:27.800]  Hold on!
[30:29.180 --> 30:31.300]  I could just hear things in my ear!
[30:31.480 --> 30:31.920]  Hurry up!
[30:31.920 --> 30:32.660]  There you go!
[30:33.860 --> 30:35.220]  I can't believe he made it.
[30:35.360 --> 30:36.560]  He keeps pressing the button.
[30:37.540 --> 30:39.360]  And you kept saying, he keeps pushing the button.
[30:39.480 --> 30:40.500]  He keeps pushing the button.
[30:40.960 --> 30:41.860]  He keeps pressing it.
[30:43.020 --> 30:44.580]  Yeah, I know, I kept pushing it.
[30:46.980 --> 30:50.020]  Wow, Gavin, you're crazy.
[30:51.960 --> 30:52.360]  Gavin!
[30:53.560 --> 30:54.360]  I suck.
[30:56.100 --> 30:58.400]  To be fair, I was on your head when it happened.
[30:59.500 --> 31:00.300]  Oh, I went in the air.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.060]  Oh my god.
[31:02.100 --> 31:04.280]  What the fuck? Andrew just pushed me out of the air.
[31:05.060 --> 31:05.460]  Sorry.
[31:05.800 --> 31:06.060]  Andrew's a menace.
[31:06.180 --> 31:07.260]  I'm not trying to.
[31:07.920 --> 31:09.300]  He's trying to, you can tell.
[31:09.360 --> 31:09.980]  Nick, get away!
[31:10.400 --> 31:11.240]  Nick's trying to.
[31:11.240 --> 31:12.400]  Go down, go Nick, go!
[31:14.980 --> 31:16.560]  Oh, Andrew, no!
[31:18.480 --> 31:19.280]  Wait a minute, hold on.
[31:19.960 --> 31:20.120]  No!
[31:20.860 --> 31:21.260]  Nick!
[31:21.480 --> 31:22.540]  Alright, alright, Nick.
[31:22.860 --> 31:23.560]  Nick, get up there.
[31:23.660 --> 31:24.740]  Just don't press the button a lot.
[31:24.860 --> 31:25.160]  You're good.
[31:26.200 --> 31:28.080]  Nick, you didn't press the button enough!
[31:28.640 --> 31:30.180]  Nick, you didn't press the button enough!
[31:30.980 --> 31:32.320]  I don't know what moved me.
[31:32.480 --> 31:33.000]  How did I move?
[31:33.040 --> 31:33.980]  I was just standing still.
[31:33.980 --> 31:34.160]  No!
[31:37.020 --> 31:37.740]  Party box!
[31:37.820 --> 31:42.840]  It's just been us bumping into each other, nothing else is happening.
[31:43.080 --> 31:45.540]  Turning on buzzing has made it a whole different game.
[31:45.940 --> 31:46.340]  Oh, definitely.
[31:50.500 --> 31:50.940]  Yes.
[31:52.040 --> 31:53.680]  Damn, the only good platform is a glue one.
[31:53.700 --> 31:54.340]  Good luck, fellas.
[31:56.860 --> 31:57.300]  No!
[31:57.760 --> 31:59.180]  Oh, Nick got mushed.
[31:59.260 --> 31:59.840]  Alright Gavin, let's go.
[31:59.980 --> 32:01.380]  Get off my head!
[32:02.300 --> 32:03.020]  What are you talking about?
[32:05.300 --> 32:06.340]  I hate...
[32:07.720 --> 32:08.240]  Die.
[32:08.500 --> 32:08.900]  Jesus.
[32:09.080 --> 32:09.340]  No!
[32:10.040 --> 32:10.560]  Yes!
[32:10.560 --> 32:12.520]  Get off my head and die somewhere!
[32:19.180 --> 32:20.440]  You got that?
[32:23.760 --> 32:24.380]  Get him!
[32:24.940 --> 32:25.640]  Get him!
[32:27.360 --> 32:28.260]  Gavin, look out!
[32:28.640 --> 32:29.720]  Oh, come on, flower!
[32:32.100 --> 32:32.740]  Hit him.
[32:34.200 --> 32:35.140]  Get off the glue.
[32:35.480 --> 32:36.160]  Get off the sticky.
[32:36.500 --> 32:37.100]  Get off the icky.
[32:39.180 --> 32:39.900]  No!
[32:42.240 --> 32:42.960]  Wow.
[32:43.800 --> 32:44.860]  A three-way...
[32:44.860 --> 32:45.740]  Huge comeback.
[32:45.800 --> 32:46.260]  Big time.
[32:46.460 --> 32:47.780]  What a win.
[32:50.820 --> 32:51.180]  No!
[32:51.960 --> 32:52.380]  Damn.
[32:53.500 --> 32:53.980]  Sorry, Nick.
[32:55.000 --> 32:55.620]  It's alright.
[33:02.450 --> 33:03.890]  That's insane!
[33:04.270 --> 33:06.050]  What are you doing?
[33:06.850 --> 33:08.230]  So, we're just...
[33:08.230 --> 33:09.670]  We can't use any of that.
[33:09.790 --> 33:11.590]  There's one space you can use.
[33:11.590 --> 33:13.170]  Yeah, it's next to us.
[33:13.170 --> 33:14.070]  Spike ball!
[33:16.870 --> 33:17.890]  No, Eric!
[33:18.450 --> 33:19.890]  Eric, stop...
[33:20.630 --> 33:21.630]  touching me!
[33:23.930 --> 33:26.070]  I can't move, I'm stuck.
[33:26.610 --> 33:28.370]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
[33:29.390 --> 33:30.030]  Okay.
[33:30.650 --> 33:31.810]  Get off my shit!
[33:32.450 --> 33:33.650]  I got him!
[33:33.950 --> 33:35.230]  Geoff, I got him!
[33:35.750 --> 33:36.210]  No!
[33:37.350 --> 33:38.730]  It's doing it again!
[33:42.190 --> 33:45.350]  How does Andrew have so much heft behind him?
[33:47.330 --> 33:48.190]  Damn it, Eric!
[33:48.790 --> 33:50.170]  What are you doing, man?
[33:50.250 --> 33:51.450]  Geoff, I caught him, didn't you see?
[33:51.490 --> 33:51.930]  He's done it.
[33:52.050 --> 33:52.710]  I saw, buddy.
[33:54.750 --> 33:55.690]  It's those ankles.
[33:55.930 --> 33:56.130]  Yeah!
[33:59.050 --> 34:00.010]  Incredible play.
[34:00.610 --> 34:01.090]  Disaster.
[34:01.690 --> 34:03.570]  Oh, this is bad for everybody.
[34:04.010 --> 34:04.450]  Oh, shit.
[34:04.510 --> 34:05.070]  I wanted that.
[34:05.350 --> 34:06.390]  I don't even...
[34:06.390 --> 34:06.770]  Whatever.
[34:10.290 --> 34:12.650]  I'm about to ruin everybody's day.
[34:15.130 --> 34:15.570]  Gavin?
[34:16.210 --> 34:17.170]  You wanna work together?
[34:18.310 --> 34:19.970]  I've always enjoyed working with you, Nick.
[34:20.670 --> 34:22.390]  Oh, that little son of a bitch.
[34:22.710 --> 34:23.410]  Me too, man.
[34:27.190 --> 34:27.710]  Good luck!
[34:27.730 --> 34:28.090]  See ya!
[34:36.770 --> 34:38.070]  Hang on!
[34:40.730 --> 34:42.110]  What is happening?
[34:43.550 --> 34:45.230]  What is going on?
[34:45.330 --> 34:48.470]  Gavin, you dodged the shit out of two bunches, buddy.
[34:48.790 --> 34:49.170]  Dude!
[34:49.510 --> 34:49.990]  Dude!
[34:50.450 --> 34:50.670]  Stop!
[34:57.580 --> 34:59.270]  He turned around!
[35:02.930 --> 35:05.650]  I thought he faced one way!
[35:06.290 --> 35:07.050]  No, he turns.
[35:07.110 --> 35:07.740]  Utter chaos.
[35:08.550 --> 35:10.430]  He's a dynamic flower, that one.
[35:23.470 --> 35:25.450]  Oh, that's... Nick, that's insane.
[35:26.070 --> 35:27.010]  Yeah, you're right.
[35:28.830 --> 35:30.090]  What the fuck?
[35:31.970 --> 35:32.990]  Nick is a monster.
[35:34.190 --> 35:34.370]  Sorry.
[35:35.530 --> 35:36.590]  You're seeing two, Nick!
[35:37.110 --> 35:37.590]  Goddammit!
[35:39.350 --> 35:39.510]  Yahoo!
[35:40.250 --> 35:41.130]  Oh, good float, Gavin.
[35:41.170 --> 35:41.690]  Oh, sh...
[35:41.690 --> 35:42.570]  Oops!
[35:43.950 --> 35:45.170]  Oh, sticky, ooh!
[35:47.010 --> 35:47.490]  Gavin...
[35:47.490 --> 35:48.190]  No!
[35:48.410 --> 35:49.570]  What a recovery!
[35:49.830 --> 35:50.490]  Stop trying me!
[35:50.550 --> 35:51.070]  Real messy!
[35:51.530 --> 35:52.570]  Stop trying me!
[35:52.790 --> 35:52.970]  No!
[35:58.770 --> 35:59.870]  Still in it, Eric!
[36:00.510 --> 36:01.650]  You got this, Eric.
[36:02.690 --> 36:04.230]  Oh, Eric is dodging the flower!
[36:04.530 --> 36:06.290]  He's still dodging the flower!
[36:06.530 --> 36:07.630]  Oh, I dodged it!
[36:07.730 --> 36:09.470]  A little more left, that was so close!
[36:13.410 --> 36:15.790]  Oh, I felt so good about getting up through that middle part, too.
[36:15.930 --> 36:16.290]  Fuck.
[36:16.710 --> 36:18.410]  Where's that frickin' jetpack when you need it?
[36:18.790 --> 36:19.330]  Yeah, no kidding.
[36:20.270 --> 36:20.970]  No bombs.
[36:21.290 --> 36:22.270]  How about a bale of hay?
[36:23.750 --> 36:24.110]  Yeah.
[36:29.590 --> 36:31.750]  It'd be cool if the bale of hay was flammable.
[36:33.330 --> 36:33.990]  Bale of hate?
[36:34.410 --> 36:34.670]  Yeah.
[36:35.950 --> 36:38.130]  That was a video we did a hundred years ago.
[36:38.350 --> 36:38.510]  Yeah.
[36:42.350 --> 36:43.570]  I don't like being in the back.
[36:43.730 --> 36:45.450]  I think that was Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
[36:47.390 --> 36:48.470]  We danced to that.
[36:49.110 --> 36:49.870]  What'd you say?
[36:50.390 --> 36:51.250]  How'd you remember that?
[36:51.470 --> 36:55.590]  I don't know, I remember, it's weird what you remember from the 10,000 old videos, you know?
[36:57.530 --> 36:58.790]  Oh, Eric! Eric!
[36:59.350 --> 37:00.490]  Eric is dancing!
[37:00.510 --> 37:01.430]  He's making it!
[37:01.530 --> 37:02.990]  You can do it, you can do it, you can do it!
[37:03.010 --> 37:03.950]  That's right, baby!
[37:04.690 --> 37:04.750]  Holy shit, Eric!
[37:04.830 --> 37:05.070]  No!
[37:05.850 --> 37:06.970]  That was brilliant.
[37:07.070 --> 37:07.390]  Solo!
[37:07.490 --> 37:08.290]  Come back!
[37:08.630 --> 37:09.790]  Let's fuckin' go!
[37:09.990 --> 37:10.770]  Oh, here it is.
[37:10.770 --> 37:11.390]  That was so good.
[37:12.910 --> 37:13.790]  That sucks.
[37:15.630 --> 37:16.610]  And now I'm in last.
[37:16.610 --> 37:17.990]  Three turns left.
[37:20.270 --> 37:21.130]  Give me the flower.
[37:21.130 --> 37:21.430]  No!
[37:22.330 --> 37:23.090]  I wanted the flower.
[37:28.000 --> 37:28.840]  Hey, good luck.
[37:36.340 --> 37:37.260]  Oh my god.
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.060]  This looks, uh...
[37:39.580 --> 37:40.020]  No!
[37:40.300 --> 37:40.980]  Oh, shit!
[37:43.260 --> 37:45.120]  Stop hitting me, stop hitting me!
[37:45.180 --> 37:46.140]  I'm fuckin' bored in here!
[37:46.300 --> 37:46.860]  Get away from it!
[37:48.700 --> 37:49.140]  No!
[37:51.620 --> 37:53.340]  Traps for days, baby!
[37:53.580 --> 37:55.620]  Oh my god, this is a nightmare.
[37:56.020 --> 37:56.880]  What am I doing down here?
[37:57.000 --> 37:57.540]  How do I...
[37:58.000 --> 37:59.460]  What the hell, dude?
[38:01.060 --> 38:02.260]  What am I doing down...
[38:02.900 --> 38:04.000]  Right into the lava!
[38:05.020 --> 38:07.360]  I got really confused as to where I was.
[38:12.120 --> 38:12.560]  Yes!
[38:16.460 --> 38:17.820]  This is the only way I win.
[38:19.660 --> 38:20.180]  No!
[38:21.560 --> 38:22.560]  This is the only way I do it.
[38:24.640 --> 38:26.780]  You better pick a good spot for that, bud.
[38:26.880 --> 38:28.840]  Where you can put it where you can get to a first time.
[38:28.840 --> 38:29.560]  You better pick...
[38:31.780 --> 38:32.180]  Shit!
[38:32.660 --> 38:33.060]  No!
[38:34.760 --> 38:35.100]  No!
[38:37.500 --> 38:37.900]  No!
[38:38.520 --> 38:39.520]  That's right, baby!
[38:40.300 --> 38:41.840]  That was awesome.
[38:42.280 --> 38:42.960]  That is...
[38:42.960 --> 38:43.780]  Oh, shit!
[38:44.480 --> 38:44.660]  Terrible!
[38:44.720 --> 38:45.700]  This is it, this is it!
[38:45.760 --> 38:46.640]  Oh, no.
[38:47.300 --> 38:47.700]  Bees!
[38:47.700 --> 38:48.160]  The bees!
[38:48.160 --> 38:48.480]  Bees!
[38:55.090 --> 38:56.610]  Wait, is that the rocket gone now?
[38:56.710 --> 38:57.690]  That's it, that's the bees.
[38:57.810 --> 38:57.830]  Oh!
[38:58.490 --> 38:58.670]  No!
[39:00.250 --> 39:00.790]  Hey, Geoff?
[39:01.050 --> 39:01.650]  Yeah, that's me.
[39:02.210 --> 39:03.190]  I'm about to play...
[39:03.190 --> 39:07.450]  Are you ready for NBA playoff style defense right now?
[39:07.590 --> 39:08.370]  Yes, I am.
[39:08.530 --> 39:09.290]  I'm about...
[39:09.290 --> 39:11.630]  I'm about to get in faces.
[39:12.150 --> 39:13.590]  This is gonna be ugly.
[39:13.890 --> 39:16.330]  You're about to go Drew Holiday on these motherfuckers.
[39:16.330 --> 39:19.570]  Oh, people are gonna talk about this performance for years.
[39:20.790 --> 39:22.310]  I died early.
[39:24.370 --> 39:25.330]  No!
[39:30.250 --> 39:32.370]  Okay, I'm stuck.
[39:32.730 --> 39:35.150]  I'm stuck on two bodies, I can't move.
[39:37.730 --> 39:38.690]  Yes!
[39:40.110 --> 39:41.070]  Reckonance!
[39:41.230 --> 39:42.050]  Defense!
[39:42.670 --> 39:43.630]  Defense!
[39:45.410 --> 39:45.890]  Geoff!
[39:46.450 --> 39:47.110]  Geoff!
[39:47.110 --> 39:48.230]  This game's broken!
[39:48.230 --> 39:49.810]  This is the goal of the game.
[39:49.970 --> 39:53.730]  You gotta make them think that you're down and out.
[39:53.850 --> 39:56.390]  All of a sudden, you hold on to them.
[39:56.430 --> 39:59.450]  You start grabbing that jersey and put a hand in their face.
[39:59.690 --> 40:00.870]  First to the floor, right?
[40:00.950 --> 40:01.730]  I'll shoot over you!
[40:01.870 --> 40:02.830]  No, you fucking won't.
[40:03.030 --> 40:05.610]  I'm Draymond Green stepping on guys right now.
[40:05.690 --> 40:07.030]  This is over.
[40:07.810 --> 40:10.150]  That is a defensive masterclass right there.
[40:10.330 --> 40:11.550]  Gavin, what are you gonna do?
[40:11.610 --> 40:12.290]  Have you tried to dance your way out?
[40:12.290 --> 40:14.330]  He's gonna hold the B button and give up, baby!
[40:14.330 --> 40:17.970]  I can't move a single inch of me.
[40:18.110 --> 40:18.590]  Exactly.
[40:19.090 --> 40:20.470]  Hold B to give up.
[40:20.890 --> 40:21.230]  Surrender.
[40:21.970 --> 40:23.430]  You dumb birdbrain bitch.
[40:23.450 --> 40:23.710]  Surrender!
[40:26.290 --> 40:26.630]  What?
[40:27.270 --> 40:27.930]  Sorry!
[40:28.510 --> 40:30.570]  He's using emotes.
[40:31.870 --> 40:34.610]  Is there a release me button?
[40:40.760 --> 40:41.820]  No, I think you're stuck.
[40:42.020 --> 40:43.620]  I don't think there's anything you can do here.
[40:51.340 --> 40:52.500]  And the winner!
[40:56.720 --> 40:57.120]  Bullshit!
[40:57.440 --> 40:58.340]  Geoff, check it out.
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.140]  Geoff, look at that.
[41:00.180 --> 41:00.360]  What a winner.
[41:00.800 --> 41:00.860]  Look at him go.
[41:01.220 --> 41:02.100]  Look at his little dance.
[41:02.200 --> 41:03.020]  Somebody clip that.
[41:03.180 --> 41:03.680]  Give me that.
[41:03.780 --> 41:04.600]  Chat, what's up?
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.220]  Clip that.
[41:05.600 --> 41:06.280]  That's a win.
[41:06.360 --> 41:07.540]  That's a victory for the raccoon.
[41:08.720 --> 41:09.120]  Congratulations.
[41:09.680 --> 41:10.700]  Thank you so much.
[41:10.740 --> 41:11.180]  That was beautiful.

[41:35.280 --> 41:38.540]  You think he's down and out, and then he comes back and wins the whole fucking thing?
[41:38.740 --> 41:39.760]  My god.
[41:40.080 --> 41:40.840]  What a champion.
[41:41.100 --> 41:45.380]  Like a prime Michael Jordan coming back to win the whole fucking thing.
[41:45.380 --> 41:47.400]  Let me say, just in defense of the podcast,
[41:47.620 --> 41:53.040]  what we lack in animals we over-index on in fruit and cum.
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.220]  So if you're into those things, the podcast is right up your alley.
[41:58.640 --> 41:59.660]  Andrew, anything to add?
[42:00.500 --> 42:03.360]  I believe the fruit enhances the cum, from what I've heard.
[42:03.520 --> 42:03.660]  Okay.
[42:03.880 --> 42:04.180]  Alright.
[42:05.100 --> 42:05.620]  Okay.
[42:06.440 --> 42:06.540]  Bye.
[42:07.320 --> 42:08.080]  Alright, bye.
