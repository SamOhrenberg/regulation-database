[00:00.000 --> 00:00.880]  Do you have the name buds?
[00:00.900 --> 00:01.760]  We're live! No.
[00:03.740 --> 00:04.460]  Oh, okay.
[00:04.960 --> 00:05.880]  How dare you?
[00:07.900 --> 00:08.260]  Hey!
[00:09.900 --> 00:11.940]  Just put it on Mario Kart and come take a seat.
[00:15.280 --> 00:16.280]  Oh my god.
[00:16.400 --> 00:18.040]  Andrew, can you keep an eye on Chad a little bit?
[00:18.220 --> 00:19.540]  I'm so fucking mad at you right now.
[00:19.660 --> 00:20.240]  Chad who?
[00:22.320 --> 00:23.440]  Where's the name bud?
[00:23.680 --> 00:24.800]  Well, you know, he's playing.
[00:26.720 --> 00:27.940]  Did this already come out?
[00:28.020 --> 00:28.800]  Yeah, I have some notes.
[00:28.800 --> 00:29.320]  Yeah.
[00:31.340 --> 00:32.460]  It's still coming out.
[00:33.000 --> 00:34.120]  It's coming out now.
[00:35.160 --> 00:36.560]  Coming out now.
[00:38.780 --> 00:40.260]  Oh man, are we live, Andrew?
[00:40.340 --> 00:40.720]  Are we good?
[00:40.820 --> 00:41.240]  How are we looking?
[00:41.840 --> 00:42.500]  Yeah, you look great.
[00:42.520 --> 00:43.420]  Okay, you have no power here.
[00:43.600 --> 00:45.120]  I'm gonna get Chad on my telephone.
[00:45.280 --> 00:45.500]  Okay.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.600]  If you have something to say to Gavin, now's the time.
[00:50.280 --> 00:52.340]  If you waited your whole life to tell him.
[00:52.620 --> 00:53.880]  To say one thing to Gavin.
[00:54.060 --> 00:54.740]  I'm good.
[00:56.520 --> 00:57.780]  Nah, I don't need to say shit to that guy.
[00:58.360 --> 00:59.540]  Now that you mention it, no.
[00:59.700 --> 01:00.780]  Yeah, like that guy at the airport.
[01:01.140 --> 01:01.920]  He drinks money.
[01:02.160 --> 01:02.560]  Yo, what's up?
[01:02.620 --> 01:03.160]  What's going on, guys?
[01:03.180 --> 01:05.560]  We got Mario Kart coming at you.
[01:06.180 --> 01:08.400]  It'll be a five player Mario Kart session.
[01:08.680 --> 01:09.400]  Coming in, yeah.
[01:10.440 --> 01:12.760]  You'll be seeing me.
[01:12.980 --> 01:13.520]  I'm Yoshi.
[01:14.360 --> 01:16.000]  You'll also be seeing Geoff.
[01:16.160 --> 01:17.200]  He is Monty Mole.
[01:17.360 --> 01:17.780]  As always.
[01:18.060 --> 01:19.160]  Oh, and also now I'm the truck.
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.040]  I can add a name bird.
[01:20.160 --> 01:21.000]  Oh my God.
[01:21.300 --> 01:23.100]  And Geoff has auto steering on.
[01:23.340 --> 01:23.920]  What does that mean?
[01:24.100 --> 01:24.700]  Does he really?
[01:25.220 --> 01:26.200]  Oh, how do I turn it off?
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.600]  It means it won't let you fall off the mat.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.660]  Oh my God.
[01:28.760 --> 01:29.260]  How do I turn it off?
[01:29.260 --> 01:29.960]  How do I turn it off?
[01:30.860 --> 01:31.580]  Go to...
[01:31.580 --> 01:33.080]  Do that again, settings, control.
[01:33.140 --> 01:34.220]  Did you say Geoff or Nick?
[01:34.340 --> 01:34.660]  Both.
[01:34.880 --> 01:35.040]  Oh.
[01:35.940 --> 01:36.660]  How do I do it?
[01:37.480 --> 01:38.060]  Turn it on.
[01:38.280 --> 01:38.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38.700 --> 01:39.640]  X, press X.
[01:40.640 --> 01:41.280]  The X button.
[01:41.760 --> 01:42.060]  Looking.
[01:42.260 --> 01:44.060]  He's looking for the X button.
[01:44.300 --> 01:44.940]  Top is X.
[01:45.000 --> 01:45.360]  There you go.
[01:45.700 --> 01:46.340]  That's an off smart steering.
[01:46.340 --> 01:46.720]  Smart steering?
[01:46.820 --> 01:47.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47.700 --> 01:48.640]  And the rest of it's fine.
[01:48.820 --> 01:49.980]  For some reason, the second player
[01:49.980 --> 01:50.940]  is always on by default.
[01:51.340 --> 01:51.700]  Insane.
[01:51.880 --> 01:52.240]  Insane.
[01:52.360 --> 01:52.980]  Vertical camera.
[01:53.060 --> 01:53.820]  Okay, so.
[01:54.180 --> 01:54.540]  Inverted.
[01:54.780 --> 01:55.040]  Yeah.
[01:55.040 --> 01:55.560]  Ugh.
[01:56.800 --> 01:58.160]  He's, listen, don't, I don't know.
[01:58.380 --> 01:59.200]  Don't judge me by him.
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.160]  Could not be getting more text messages right now.
[02:02.320 --> 02:04.680]  Guys, we are...
[02:04.680 --> 02:06.000]  That's true, he said at lunch.
[02:06.120 --> 02:06.940]  We're live.
[02:07.260 --> 02:08.540]  We are playing Mario Kart.
[02:08.740 --> 02:09.540]  I am Yoshi.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.540]  You got Monty Mole, that's Geoff.
[02:12.020 --> 02:14.460]  You'll also see, I think Bowser is Gavin.
[02:14.540 --> 02:15.060]  Is that right, Gavin?
[02:15.080 --> 02:15.900]  Yeah, I'm Bowser.
[02:16.300 --> 02:17.580]  Dry Bowser's gone.
[02:17.680 --> 02:18.180]  Where is he?
[02:18.320 --> 02:19.300]  Where's dry Bowser?
[02:19.500 --> 02:20.600]  Nick is Mario.
[02:20.840 --> 02:21.320]  I'm Mario, baby.
[02:21.440 --> 02:22.280]  Andrew, who did you pick?
[02:23.220 --> 02:24.400]  Donkey Kong, obviously.
[02:24.400 --> 02:26.040]  Yeah, Donkey Kong.
[02:27.040 --> 02:28.740]  I think we're just doing a Grand Prix to start.
[02:28.860 --> 02:30.000]  We'll see how it goes from there.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.240]  Geoff just played this earlier.
[02:31.340 --> 02:32.660]  He was very excited to be playing it.
[02:33.180 --> 02:34.020]  Let's see what's going on.
[02:34.080 --> 02:34.300]  Let's see.
[02:34.360 --> 02:34.900]  Start game.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.140]  Ooh, here we go.
[02:37.420 --> 02:38.340]  Oh, we can do Knockout Tour?
[02:39.440 --> 02:40.180]  Let's do that.
[02:40.800 --> 02:42.140]  I don't care about computer difficulty.
[02:42.620 --> 02:43.420]  150cc's great.
[02:43.900 --> 02:45.840]  Is that what you want or not what you want?
[02:45.860 --> 02:46.580]  I love it, dude.
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.480]  That's fantastic.
[02:47.760 --> 02:48.820]  Stop texting me.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.480]  He's not, he's looking at his thing.
[02:51.180 --> 02:52.600]  Check this out.
[02:52.900 --> 02:53.660]  Do not disturb.
[02:54.500 --> 02:55.380]  Here we go.
[02:55.380 --> 02:56.900]  You hit the streaming computer.
[02:57.180 --> 02:57.260]  Good.
[02:57.560 --> 02:58.240]  Okay, here we go.
[02:58.320 --> 02:59.180]  Knockout Tour.
[02:59.320 --> 02:59.700]  No!
[03:00.180 --> 03:00.620]  Andrew!
[03:00.920 --> 03:01.700]  Oh, shit.
[03:01.860 --> 03:03.260]  Andrew, go get fucking set up.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.080]  I'm going for it.
[03:04.100 --> 03:04.440]  Stop!
[03:04.700 --> 03:05.180]  Not the keyboard!
[03:05.280 --> 03:05.740]  Not the keyboard!
[03:06.020 --> 03:06.500]  Don't look at me!
[03:07.700 --> 03:09.240]  Dill, not the keyboard.
[03:09.980 --> 03:12.880]  We gotta Dill-safe this room because we forgot about Dill.
[03:12.940 --> 03:13.760]  Oh my God.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.220]  We're gonna random.
[03:15.820 --> 03:16.460]  All right, boys.
[03:17.140 --> 03:18.480]  It's Mario Kart time.
[03:19.140 --> 03:20.620]  We're randoming this whole thing.
[03:20.780 --> 03:21.480]  I hit random.
[03:21.640 --> 03:22.580]  Nobody else chose anything.
[03:22.720 --> 03:23.200]  Here we go.
[03:23.300 --> 03:23.460]  Okay.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.860]  I didn't choose the map.
[03:25.520 --> 03:26.500]  Get away from me, Andrew.
[03:26.700 --> 03:27.160]  Oh, shit.
[03:27.400 --> 03:27.640]  I'm starting.
[03:29.300 --> 03:29.720]  There you go.
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.060]  We are?
[03:30.420 --> 03:31.780]  The course has been selected.
[03:32.840 --> 03:34.540]  Oh, can we do something?
[03:34.640 --> 03:35.620]  No, it's just going.
[03:36.100 --> 03:37.360]  All right, here we go.
[03:38.000 --> 03:38.700]  Here we go.
[03:38.940 --> 03:39.980]  24 man.
[03:40.100 --> 03:41.060]  24 man.
[03:41.120 --> 03:41.400]  Is that better?
[03:41.460 --> 03:41.980]  Oh, God.
[03:42.660 --> 03:43.520]  Jesus Christ.
[03:44.100 --> 03:45.400]  24 man race.
[03:45.640 --> 03:48.920]  Knockout means the bottom four are eliminated.
[03:49.260 --> 03:49.640]  Knockout.
[03:49.780 --> 03:51.380]  Welcome to the stream.
[03:51.700 --> 03:52.420]  Let's do this thing.
[03:53.140 --> 03:53.860]  Mario style.
[03:53.860 --> 03:55.020]  Nick and I have a small TV.
[03:55.320 --> 03:55.820]  Yeah, sorry.
[03:56.700 --> 03:57.820]  Somebody didn't bring their dock.
[03:58.260 --> 03:58.520]  That's true.
[04:02.600 --> 04:04.280]  Andrew, how are you liking this game so far?
[04:04.360 --> 04:04.860]  You've never been on Mario Kart.
[04:04.860 --> 04:05.940]  I've barely played it.
[04:07.260 --> 04:08.720]  Well, it's against your religion, right?
[04:08.940 --> 04:09.420]  Oh, yeah.
[04:09.940 --> 04:12.260]  Definitely as a Garfield Kart supporter.
[04:13.240 --> 04:15.020]  Oh, someone twatted my shell off.
[04:15.040 --> 04:15.580]  Yeah, it was me, baby.
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.900]  Oh, there's coins everywhere.
[04:21.080 --> 04:21.720]  Oh, here we go.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.880]  Ow, son of a bitch, Andrew.
[04:24.220 --> 04:25.860]  20 coins will give you a boost.
[04:25.980 --> 04:27.380]  Yeah, coins poison you, remember that.
[04:28.120 --> 04:30.420]  They drain your health over time.
[04:31.680 --> 04:32.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:32.780 --> 04:33.980]  Ow, fuck, fuck.
[04:34.520 --> 04:34.680]  Yep.
[04:34.900 --> 04:35.580]  You mean communism?
[04:37.420 --> 04:38.180]  Yeah, here we go.
[04:38.240 --> 04:38.940]  I'm big now.
[04:40.760 --> 04:41.200]  Who's in?
[04:41.260 --> 04:41.540]  What am I?
[04:41.620 --> 04:42.040]  Here we go.
[04:43.400 --> 04:43.720]  Dick.
[04:44.220 --> 04:45.140]  Oh, there's Andrew ahead of me.
[04:45.680 --> 04:46.700]  I don't know what's going on.
[04:46.700 --> 04:47.080]  Here we go.
[04:47.640 --> 04:48.260]  What do you mean?
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.240]  Oh, who's in first?
[04:49.460 --> 04:50.160]  You want a blue shell?
[04:50.260 --> 04:50.560]  No!
[04:51.720 --> 04:52.200]  No!
[04:53.220 --> 04:53.920]  Ow, son of a bitch!
[04:54.020 --> 04:54.900]  You bastard, man.
[04:55.200 --> 04:55.880]  Take that, Andrew.
[04:56.180 --> 04:57.860]  Oh, shit, big giant bastard.
[04:58.140 --> 04:59.140]  Everything went wrong.
[04:59.860 --> 05:00.240]  Ow!
[05:00.300 --> 05:01.180]  Oh, my God.
[05:01.720 --> 05:02.920]  Cheap height and bullshit.
[05:03.540 --> 05:05.060]  Yeah, you stupid fucking mole.
[05:05.760 --> 05:06.140]  What's up?
[05:07.060 --> 05:08.120]  I see you.
[05:08.880 --> 05:09.740]  Oh, shit.
[05:09.760 --> 05:10.980]  Okay, I'm in 14.
[05:11.100 --> 05:11.740]  Oh, my God.
[05:11.740 --> 05:12.180]  What does this mean?
[05:12.260 --> 05:12.660]  20?
[05:12.960 --> 05:13.160]  Okay.
[05:13.260 --> 05:13.580]  Here we go.
[05:14.100 --> 05:17.880]  So, the bottom four were just eliminated.
[05:18.060 --> 05:19.540]  That was the first of six gates.
[05:19.680 --> 05:19.840]  Yep.
[05:20.300 --> 05:20.840]  Ow!
[05:20.840 --> 05:23.500]  This is a non-stop race.
[05:23.520 --> 05:24.600]  There are not laps.
[05:24.980 --> 05:26.320]  Oh, Gavin, you fucked up.
[05:26.960 --> 05:27.580]  Oh, my God.
[05:28.780 --> 05:29.500]  Oh, shit!
[05:30.160 --> 05:31.660]  When I played this earlier with Geoff,
[05:31.680 --> 05:32.760]  he had to stand in front of me.
[05:32.840 --> 05:33.500]  He was so excited.
[05:33.740 --> 05:34.440]  I was enjoying it.
[05:34.560 --> 05:34.700]  Excuse me.
[05:34.780 --> 05:36.000]  He was so into it.
[05:37.280 --> 05:38.060]  Oh, cars!
[05:39.740 --> 05:40.080]  How am I?
[05:40.640 --> 05:41.000]  Nevermind.
[05:42.260 --> 05:42.980]  What is this?
[05:43.300 --> 05:44.520]  We got to say how am I first.
[05:44.680 --> 05:44.940]  Yep.
[05:45.240 --> 05:46.260]  That's absolutely what he was saying.
[05:46.740 --> 05:47.080]  Oh!
[05:47.740 --> 05:48.340]  Die, prick!
[05:48.340 --> 05:48.460]  Die, prick!
[05:49.500 --> 05:50.360]  Dill getting slapped.
[05:50.680 --> 05:52.140]  Oh, his bum's, his bum's central.
[05:52.140 --> 05:52.520]  Bum's.
[05:52.540 --> 05:53.100]  Oh, bum, bum!
[05:53.180 --> 05:53.900]  Oh, shit.
[05:54.340 --> 05:54.720]  I'm hit.
[05:55.380 --> 05:56.080]  Take that, Dill.
[05:56.900 --> 05:57.760]  I'm getting a snack.
[05:57.860 --> 05:58.640]  Get away from me.
[05:59.500 --> 06:00.140]  Oh, don't touch me.
[06:00.260 --> 06:00.740]  I got a sandwich.
[06:00.740 --> 06:01.080]  Got it.
[06:01.580 --> 06:02.160]  Come on.
[06:02.580 --> 06:03.420]  Come on, Yoshi.
[06:03.660 --> 06:04.480]  Looking good.
[06:04.880 --> 06:05.120]  Yeah!
[06:05.380 --> 06:05.540]  Oh, no!
[06:06.000 --> 06:06.620]  Metal Yoshi!
[06:08.140 --> 06:08.920]  That's for you.
[06:09.100 --> 06:09.820]  Blow up, bitch.
[06:10.260 --> 06:10.600]  Ow.
[06:10.820 --> 06:11.200]  That was on you.
[06:11.440 --> 06:11.560]  Sorry, Gavin.
[06:11.620 --> 06:12.040]  Had to be done.
[06:13.680 --> 06:15.180]  Oh, Dill's getting hammered.
[06:15.420 --> 06:15.820]  Ah!
[06:15.920 --> 06:16.320]  Ah!
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.060]  Dill hammered?
[06:17.060 --> 06:18.040]  Oh, my God.
[06:18.060 --> 06:18.920]  This is so...
[06:18.920 --> 06:19.160]  Dude.
[06:19.400 --> 06:19.460]  Whoa!
[06:20.560 --> 06:21.360]  Oh, I missed all the...
[06:21.360 --> 06:21.600]  Ah!
[06:24.400 --> 06:26.780]  You can't see it, but the little TV's in first and second.
[06:27.020 --> 06:27.280]  Oh, no.
[06:27.520 --> 06:28.200]  Dill's in second.
[06:28.820 --> 06:29.340]  Oh, no.
[06:29.360 --> 06:30.040]  I missed!
[06:30.500 --> 06:31.200]  Oh, no!
[06:31.780 --> 06:32.260]  Oh, God.
[06:32.540 --> 06:33.720]  You son of a bitch.
[06:33.920 --> 06:34.500]  Oh, no.
[06:34.500 --> 06:36.320]  Oh, I got pwned by the Dill.
[06:37.140 --> 06:37.940]  Oh, I got...
[06:37.940 --> 06:39.120]  I got triple fucked.
[06:39.520 --> 06:41.180]  This is so bad.
[06:41.860 --> 06:42.440]  Boys, I might...
[06:42.440 --> 06:43.600]  Boys, I might not make it.
[06:43.720 --> 06:44.260]  You'll die.
[06:46.080 --> 06:46.920]  Oh, I can't...
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.280]  Oh, Nick, you fool!
[06:49.140 --> 06:51.420]  150 is like one wrong turn and you're just hurt.
[06:51.520 --> 06:52.140]  I drown myself.
[06:56.800 --> 06:58.720]  Nobody throw any blue shells up at first.
[06:58.780 --> 06:59.420]  It's not allowed.
[06:59.540 --> 06:59.920]  It's illegal.
[07:00.200 --> 07:01.200]  Dill's got quite the lead now.
[07:01.620 --> 07:01.860]  Yep.
[07:02.720 --> 07:03.180]  All right, well...
[07:03.180 --> 07:03.440]  Oh!
[07:03.900 --> 07:05.140]  I'm gonna have to slap him with this boom.
[07:05.220 --> 07:05.440]  No!
[07:05.860 --> 07:07.180]  Oh, just off the road.
[07:08.140 --> 07:08.440]  Ah!
[07:10.100 --> 07:10.460]  16!
[07:11.180 --> 07:11.620]  Come on, baby.
[07:11.680 --> 07:12.360]  All right, we're still in.
[07:12.440 --> 07:12.900]  Geoff, me and you.
[07:13.000 --> 07:13.620]  All right, we're still in.
[07:13.700 --> 07:14.340]  Geoff, me and you.
[07:15.300 --> 07:16.020]  Oh, I fell.
[07:16.020 --> 07:16.920]  Gavin, we have to kill him.
[07:17.720 --> 07:18.280]  What, Dill?
[07:18.480 --> 07:18.780]  No!
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.120]  Why me?
[07:21.000 --> 07:21.840]  Dill must die.
[07:22.440 --> 07:23.540]  It's a little extreme.
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.580]  I'll just let you pass if it's that...
[07:26.580 --> 07:27.480]  I see Gavin up here.
[07:27.680 --> 07:28.380]  Okay, you can pass.
[07:28.460 --> 07:29.060]  I mean, I can pass.
[07:29.120 --> 07:29.980]  I see Gavin up here.
[07:30.080 --> 07:30.580]  Don't look at me.
[07:31.880 --> 07:32.920]  I'm not a part of this.
[07:33.160 --> 07:34.380]  I hit you in second!
[07:35.160 --> 07:35.760]  You are?
[07:35.980 --> 07:37.160]  Did you grab any items?
[07:37.540 --> 07:37.800]  Who, me?
[07:37.940 --> 07:38.160]  Yeah.
[07:38.260 --> 07:38.860]  Yeah, two of them.
[07:39.080 --> 07:39.540]  Who, me?
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.080]  Who, me?
[07:42.820 --> 07:44.400]  Oh, Dill, I see what you're doing.
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.480]  I don't know what I'm doing.
[07:46.760 --> 07:47.800]  You're throwing shit.
[07:48.140 --> 07:48.920]  I am doing that.
[07:50.180 --> 07:51.400]  How did Eric get up there?
[07:52.360 --> 07:53.480]  Oh, very carefully.
[07:53.620 --> 07:54.600]  It's very hard to see the cost.
[07:54.820 --> 07:55.040]  Ah!
[07:55.500 --> 07:55.700]  Woo!
[07:56.800 --> 07:57.240]  Ah!
[07:58.360 --> 07:58.640]  No!
[07:58.660 --> 07:59.460]  My items!
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.220]  My items, no!
[08:01.640 --> 08:03.400]  Yeah, you don't want to be precious with them.
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.820]  I wasn't trying to be.
[08:05.940 --> 08:06.540]  Never saw that movie.
[08:06.660 --> 08:07.840]  Just throwing everything I have.
[08:09.920 --> 08:10.200]  Oh!
[08:10.780 --> 08:11.680]  I smell a bluey.
[08:11.720 --> 08:12.420]  Oh my God!
[08:12.420 --> 08:13.320]  No, no!
[08:13.980 --> 08:15.620]  I see it in the mini-map!
[08:15.800 --> 08:16.000]  No!
[08:20.680 --> 08:21.020]  Andrew.
[08:22.140 --> 08:23.140]  Come back here, Gavin!
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.300]  12.
[08:27.500 --> 08:28.460]  You're smarter than Ed now.
[08:28.600 --> 08:29.300]  Here we go!
[08:29.440 --> 08:29.980]  Geoff, where are you?
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.140]  I'm in the six.
[08:31.500 --> 08:31.640]  Okay.
[08:32.580 --> 08:33.780]  Oops, I used my coin box.
[08:33.940 --> 08:34.640]  Die, Eric!
[08:35.160 --> 08:36.000]  Oh my God!
[08:36.240 --> 08:36.920]  Oh, I got you!
[08:37.060 --> 08:37.300]  Yeah.
[08:37.440 --> 08:37.840]  Goodbye, Eric.
[08:39.360 --> 08:40.100]  I didn't expect that one.
[08:40.100 --> 08:40.660]  I don't think you...
[08:40.660 --> 08:41.420]  Oh, did you pass me?
[08:41.560 --> 08:42.000]  Yeah, I did.
[08:42.580 --> 08:43.120]  Good work.
[08:43.240 --> 08:43.960]  Is this the track?
[08:44.060 --> 08:44.420]  Am I on it?
[08:45.060 --> 08:45.820]  Ball, ball.
[08:45.900 --> 08:46.420]  Ball, ball.
[08:48.160 --> 08:50.040]  Hey, Jordan's playing Mario Kart World!
[08:50.080 --> 08:51.080]  Get him, get him, get him, get him!
[08:51.200 --> 08:52.340]  Jordan swears, welcome!
[08:54.000 --> 08:54.860]  Send him an invite.
[08:55.280 --> 08:56.520]  Oh, it's Buzz!
[08:57.480 --> 08:58.180]  Oh, Buzz!
[08:58.440 --> 08:59.380]  I needed that.
[09:03.540 --> 09:05.600]  Must kill Gavin.
[09:07.360 --> 09:08.520]  Oh, someone's throwing shit.
[09:09.140 --> 09:09.480]  It's me!
[09:09.640 --> 09:10.100]  Throw that shit in.
[09:10.280 --> 09:11.660]  So much traffic!
[09:12.620 --> 09:13.020]  Eric!
[09:13.640 --> 09:14.080]  God damn it.
[09:14.140 --> 09:14.600]  Did you get hit?
[09:14.760 --> 09:15.060]  Yes.
[09:15.200 --> 09:15.780]  Oh, man.
[09:16.620 --> 09:17.960]  You're not gonna like that, either, then.
[09:19.360 --> 09:20.380]  We need to catch Gavin.
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.800]  Are you in first, Gavin?
[09:23.180 --> 09:23.860]  He is.
[09:24.220 --> 09:24.960]  No, 11th.
[09:24.980 --> 09:25.540]  There's two ones.
[09:27.580 --> 09:28.440]  Geoff, me and you.
[09:28.600 --> 09:29.160]  Me and you.
[09:29.580 --> 09:30.080]  Gettin' Gavin.
[09:30.280 --> 09:31.120]  Yep, gettin' Gavin.
[09:31.220 --> 09:32.840]  We're all, we're at the top spot.
[09:34.300 --> 09:35.200]  Team get Gavin.
[09:37.800 --> 09:38.040]  Ooh.
[09:39.660 --> 09:40.380]  Could've been a jump.
[09:40.380 --> 09:41.460]  Come on.
[09:42.600 --> 09:43.320]  All right, here we go.
[09:43.960 --> 09:44.340]  Okay, this is-
[09:44.340 --> 09:44.660]  There you go.
[09:44.760 --> 09:45.480]  That's gonna fuck him up.
[09:45.640 --> 09:45.760]  Oh!
[09:47.180 --> 09:47.420]  Fuck!
[09:47.560 --> 09:48.380]  Got with the greed.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.660]  That's a real slap in the knob.
[09:50.360 --> 09:50.860]  Come on!
[09:51.700 --> 09:52.460]  A knob slap, eh?
[09:53.040 --> 09:54.500]  The old knob slap.
[09:55.620 --> 09:55.980]  Ah!
[09:56.360 --> 09:56.680]  Eric.
[09:57.000 --> 09:57.280]  Yeah?
[09:57.600 --> 09:58.140]  I'm sorry.
[09:58.400 --> 09:59.140]  Yeah, I'm still there.
[09:59.280 --> 10:01.040]  Gavin made me do it to Kara Eberle once.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.420]  No, you didn't do it to her.
[10:05.460 --> 10:06.220]  You did it to me.
[10:06.360 --> 10:07.020]  I did it to you.
[10:07.280 --> 10:07.980]  In front of her.
[10:09.020 --> 10:09.620]  That's different.
[10:11.540 --> 10:12.520]  Oh my God.
[10:13.020 --> 10:13.540]  Shit!
[10:14.020 --> 10:14.300]  I just-
[10:14.300 --> 10:15.100]  Ah, the bomb!
[10:16.540 --> 10:17.500]  Ooh, sandwich.
[10:19.560 --> 10:21.260]  Oh, I got a new Yoshi look!
[10:21.740 --> 10:22.020]  Nice!
[10:22.020 --> 10:22.480]  Oh, what color?
[10:22.740 --> 10:23.120]  Yellow!
[10:24.280 --> 10:24.800]  Yellow!
[10:25.340 --> 10:25.900]  Is this thing on?
[10:26.020 --> 10:26.240]  Yellow!
[10:26.380 --> 10:26.720]  Yellow!
[10:32.000 --> 10:33.020]  Oh, we're getting icy.
[10:33.600 --> 10:33.960]  Come on.
[10:34.140 --> 10:34.820]  Come on, boys.
[10:34.980 --> 10:35.400]  Come on.
[10:36.740 --> 10:37.260]  Oh.
[10:37.560 --> 10:40.080]  God, they must just be so far up there.
[10:40.080 --> 10:41.040]  Yeah, where are they?
[10:41.160 --> 10:41.900]  God damn.
[10:41.900 --> 10:42.620]  Shit.
[10:45.360 --> 10:48.400]  I don't want mushrooms, I want weapons!
[10:52.960 --> 10:55.540]  If you had someone just sit on the first map,
[10:55.900 --> 10:57.600]  would it still load all the other maps?
[10:58.540 --> 10:58.960]  What?
[10:59.520 --> 11:01.640]  We're so far away from where this race started.
[11:01.700 --> 11:02.140]  Oh, I see.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.640]  It's just a hell of a lot to keep loading
[11:04.640 --> 11:05.540]  the same console.
[11:05.680 --> 11:05.960]  Come on!
[11:06.360 --> 11:06.860]  Hit him!
[11:07.480 --> 11:08.180]  God damn it!
[11:08.600 --> 11:09.280]  Uh-oh, someone's coming.
[11:12.780 --> 11:14.720]  We got a blue shell or something.
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.340]  I'm trying.
[11:18.340 --> 11:19.640]  I think that's been enough, boys.
[11:20.020 --> 11:20.460]  Ow!
[11:20.720 --> 11:22.720]  The Bob-omb range is so wide!
[11:24.800 --> 11:25.600]  Come on.
[11:27.320 --> 11:27.740]  Four!
[11:27.940 --> 11:28.620]  I will catch you.
[11:28.640 --> 11:29.000]  Four!
[11:30.040 --> 11:30.920]  Who's in fourth?
[11:33.180 --> 11:34.080]  Oh, it's me, baby!
[11:35.020 --> 11:35.560]  Oh no!
[11:35.740 --> 11:35.980]  Oh no!
[11:36.100 --> 11:36.800]  Oh, I'm out.
[11:37.440 --> 11:37.960]  Oh, Geoff.
[11:38.140 --> 11:38.560]  Geoff's dead.
[11:38.740 --> 11:39.300]  I got fourth.
[11:41.260 --> 11:42.740]  I almost had Gavin.
[11:43.140 --> 11:43.620]  No!
[11:44.600 --> 11:44.840]  Yeah!
[11:45.040 --> 11:45.360]  No!
[11:47.500 --> 11:48.400]  Did you go off?
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.360]  Yeah, we all did.
[11:49.460 --> 11:50.380]  Me and Nick.
[11:51.180 --> 11:53.960]  I hit him with a shell and then I died for my trouble.
[11:54.420 --> 11:55.080]  Your sins.
[11:56.820 --> 12:01.580]  Oh, Nick, you fucking...
[12:02.220 --> 12:03.400]  You dumb bitch.
[12:06.200 --> 12:07.200]  Stop throwing shit!
[12:07.360 --> 12:08.780]  Oh, I'm getting wrecked now!
[12:08.780 --> 12:10.040]  Come on, come on.
[12:11.080 --> 12:13.780]  Please give me a weapon that will help me.
[12:13.860 --> 12:14.640]  Oh, I wanted a mushroom.
[12:14.960 --> 12:15.780]  Give me the shrooms.
[12:16.980 --> 12:17.960]  Give me a...
[12:19.180 --> 12:19.820]  No!
[12:21.860 --> 12:22.860]  Get there!
[12:24.380 --> 12:25.660]  Second place!
[12:25.700 --> 12:26.780]  Aw, balls.
[12:27.260 --> 12:28.440]  Take that, you monkey.
[12:30.320 --> 12:31.620]  We both lost.
[12:31.680 --> 12:33.760]  I don't know why I'm getting aggression from you.
[12:34.580 --> 12:35.740]  Aim it upwards.
[12:37.440 --> 12:38.240]  Oh, shit.
[12:38.860 --> 12:39.260]  Wow!
[12:40.120 --> 12:41.120]  Oh, that was a good time.
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.700]  Gavin, Eric, Andrew, Gavin, Eric.
[12:44.440 --> 12:44.840]  Oh.
[12:46.600 --> 12:47.800]  God, that was crazy.
[12:48.220 --> 12:49.600]  That is...
[12:49.600 --> 12:50.500]  I was clenched.
[12:50.820 --> 12:51.020]  Yeah.
[12:51.160 --> 12:51.820]  I feel good about this.
[12:51.980 --> 12:52.800]  Are we still playing this?
[12:52.860 --> 12:53.000]  Okay.
[12:53.120 --> 12:54.940]  Yeah, do we...
[12:54.940 --> 12:56.000]  Invite, invite Jordan.
[12:56.740 --> 12:58.500]  Do we want to...
[12:58.500 --> 13:01.480]  Do we want to show the room info so people can jump on?
[13:01.740 --> 13:01.800]  Absolutely.
[13:01.800 --> 13:03.120]  Somebody said Andrew's quiet.
[13:03.760 --> 13:04.020]  Is he?
[13:04.240 --> 13:04.420]  Okay.
[13:04.420 --> 13:05.880]  All right, Andrew, turn yourself up.
[13:06.240 --> 13:08.180]  I'm at full volume.
[13:08.880 --> 13:09.200]  Okay.
[13:09.620 --> 13:11.380]  Guys, we're going to show you the room info.
[13:12.180 --> 13:14.320]  If you see it, you better be ready to join.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.220]  There it is.
[13:16.600 --> 13:18.760]  Somebody said y'all are about to get wrecked.
[13:18.940 --> 13:19.140]  Yeah.
[13:19.320 --> 13:20.040]  Oh, I know we are.
[13:20.660 --> 13:20.920]  Yeah.
[13:21.320 --> 13:22.120]  Oh, absolutely.
[13:22.480 --> 13:23.740]  I mean, we struggled, but...
[13:23.740 --> 13:24.880]  Our anuses are about to get done.
[13:24.880 --> 13:25.400]  Yeah, it's going to be bad.
[13:27.460 --> 13:28.300]  Andrew, you having fun?
[13:28.700 --> 13:30.020]  I'm having so much fun.
[13:30.560 --> 13:30.780]  Good.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.300]  This is the first time I've played this online with people.
[13:33.380 --> 13:33.840]  This is great.
[13:34.260 --> 13:35.460]  Oh, he does sound better.
[13:35.720 --> 13:37.840]  I've noticed that stuff happens on your screen
[13:37.840 --> 13:39.520]  that doesn't necessarily happen on other screens.
[13:39.660 --> 13:40.020]  How do you mean?
[13:40.360 --> 13:42.180]  The sound of it?
[13:42.260 --> 13:43.040]  No, like...
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.340]  Hey, one person joined.
[13:44.520 --> 13:46.760]  Like on your screen, you might hit someone with a shell,
[13:46.860 --> 13:47.760]  but on your screen, it never hit you.
[13:48.440 --> 13:50.960]  Is the chat saying they're having a problem or anything?
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.040]  One person joined.
[13:53.200 --> 13:55.120]  Yeah, I'm going to text this to Jordan right now.
[13:55.240 --> 13:56.260]  He's not going to get in.
[13:56.300 --> 13:56.640]  He might.
[13:56.820 --> 13:57.420]  He might.
[13:58.960 --> 14:00.400]  One, what is happening?
[14:00.400 --> 14:01.260]  Ray Crux.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.060]  People are just like, oh, I forgot to buy a Switch 2.
[14:05.220 --> 14:05.580]  Same.
[14:05.940 --> 14:06.800]  What's the chat saying?
[14:07.740 --> 14:08.640]  Sucks to suck.
[14:09.140 --> 14:10.360]  Don't have a Switch 2 yet.
[14:10.420 --> 14:12.440]  All right, Ray, it's just us and Ray Crux.
[14:12.760 --> 14:13.620]  We are...
[14:15.020 --> 14:16.580]  Ray Crux, you're in the podcast.
[14:16.720 --> 14:17.560]  Welcome to it.
[14:17.580 --> 14:19.340]  We've only got two Switches between us, right?
[14:19.480 --> 14:19.660]  Yeah.
[14:20.200 --> 14:21.100]  Nick has one now.
[14:21.400 --> 14:22.360]  I do, but it's at home.
[14:22.680 --> 14:24.520]  It's everybody but me now, I think.
[14:24.600 --> 14:26.500]  Did you just send him the picture of the TV?
[14:26.560 --> 14:27.340]  And I said, join us.
[14:27.380 --> 14:28.540]  You're a maniac.
[14:29.060 --> 14:30.560]  Hey, all right, look at this.
[14:30.800 --> 14:31.360]  There we go.
[14:31.360 --> 14:32.120]  There's people coming.
[14:32.340 --> 14:35.700]  Midnight, Mark Sully, Madamoose, Young Eric.
[14:35.800 --> 14:36.220]  What the hell?
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.580]  Jake, Onyx.
[14:37.900 --> 14:38.180]  Guys.
[14:38.440 --> 14:40.100]  What this is going to be, if we do a knockout,
[14:40.240 --> 14:42.100]  is about halfway through the race,
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.580]  we'll be watching them play.
[14:43.720 --> 14:44.760]  There's no knockout here.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.120]  No, we're not going to do a knockout.
[14:46.240 --> 14:46.920]  Knockout was fun.
[14:47.000 --> 14:47.760]  That was a good way to start.
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.440]  I mean, we should do a knockout eventually.
[14:49.640 --> 14:50.880]  We'll do a knockout at the end,
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.080]  but King Chadly is, even King Chadly made it?
[14:54.880 --> 14:55.540]  The Chadster.
[14:55.540 --> 14:58.580]  Guys, we got Shuby and Harrison.
[14:58.880 --> 14:59.640]  Oh, shit.
[14:59.640 --> 15:00.760]  Oh, some people are being catty.
[15:00.900 --> 15:01.480]  This person says,
[15:01.600 --> 15:03.560]  I don't have the podcast money to buy a Switch.
[15:03.700 --> 15:04.220]  Oh, okay.
[15:04.500 --> 15:05.660]  I don't have a Switch too, either.
[15:05.740 --> 15:06.440]  Yeah, anything else?
[15:06.840 --> 15:07.580]  Thanks for watching.
[15:08.300 --> 15:08.880]  Thank you.
[15:09.440 --> 15:09.940]  We're sorry.
[15:10.120 --> 15:12.100]  Thanks for the sub there, Tardy the Turtle.
[15:14.520 --> 15:16.200]  We don't have chat right in front of us,
[15:16.220 --> 15:18.180]  so thank you very much for everyone who's watching.
[15:18.440 --> 15:19.040]  Oh, they're being nice.
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.860]  Everyone's doing this, and thank you guys very much.
[15:20.920 --> 15:21.880]  This is a lot of fun.
[15:21.900 --> 15:23.120]  I'm really excited to play with you guys.
[15:24.360 --> 15:24.680]  Uh...
[15:24.680 --> 15:25.180]  Oh, Queefs Combo.
[15:25.180 --> 15:26.300]  Whoa, Queefs Combo.
[15:26.620 --> 15:27.380]  How many was that?
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.180]  Holy shit.
[15:28.180 --> 15:29.040]  I think it was 10, maybe?
[15:29.420 --> 15:29.720]  Yeah, 10.
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.380]  Queefs Combo.
[15:30.660 --> 15:32.100]  Brandon and Jayden are...
[15:32.100 --> 15:32.480]  Should we just...
[15:32.480 --> 15:33.560]  How can Nintendo do this?
[15:33.600 --> 15:34.860]  Should we wait, or should we just do it?
[15:35.040 --> 15:35.640]  That'll fill up.
[15:35.640 --> 15:36.220]  Give it a second.
[15:36.420 --> 15:36.560]  Okay.
[15:36.700 --> 15:37.460]  Give it a second, it'll fill.
[15:38.160 --> 15:38.960]  Jordan won't do it.
[15:39.120 --> 15:39.720]  Jordan, please.
[15:40.200 --> 15:40.420]  No.
[15:40.600 --> 15:41.800]  Is this Garfield Kart 2?
[15:41.940 --> 15:42.560]  All right, we're done.
[15:42.860 --> 15:43.700]  It's locked in.
[15:43.880 --> 15:44.040]  Okay.
[15:47.060 --> 15:47.700]  Jordan PLZ.
[15:47.860 --> 15:49.900]  150, no teams, normal items, calm.
[15:49.980 --> 15:51.040]  There's no calm, doesn't matter.
[15:51.580 --> 15:53.560]  Race count, three races, four races?
[15:53.700 --> 15:54.780]  Four races, 10 seconds.
[15:55.960 --> 15:56.180]  What?
[15:56.980 --> 15:57.120]  Oh, wow.
[15:57.200 --> 15:58.320]  Y'all are lucky I'm at work,
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.780]  or I would put the hurt on you.
[16:00.460 --> 16:00.780]  Okay.
[16:01.180 --> 16:02.860]  Do you have the podcast money for a Switch 2?
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.960]  I mean, everybody has a podcast, theoretically.
[16:07.980 --> 16:08.500]  That's true.
[16:09.140 --> 16:10.560]  There's a couple, there's about three million.
[16:10.720 --> 16:11.240]  You know what?
[16:12.200 --> 16:12.560]  Random.
[16:13.140 --> 16:13.500]  Ooh.
[16:15.700 --> 16:17.700]  I like, I like the randomness of it.
[16:17.860 --> 16:18.420]  That's, that's me.
[16:18.640 --> 16:18.820]  Wow.
[16:19.020 --> 16:20.240]  I've never seen so many votes.
[16:20.240 --> 16:21.140]  Oh, wow, this is crazy.
[16:21.580 --> 16:22.240]  Oh my God.
[16:22.360 --> 16:23.060]  So many votes.
[16:23.220 --> 16:24.560]  Guy like me leaves it up to God.
[16:25.340 --> 16:27.020]  A lot of people saying their Switch 2 money
[16:27.020 --> 16:28.860]  went to gifted subs and Gerplers.
[16:29.120 --> 16:29.480]  Oh, wow.
[16:29.780 --> 16:30.680]  Thank you very much.
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.660]  Speaking of Gerplers,
[16:34.120 --> 16:35.800]  we've got some good Gerpler news today.
[16:36.160 --> 16:36.400]  Yep.
[16:36.560 --> 16:38.840]  They're, we're getting close.
[16:39.020 --> 16:39.740]  We're getting real close.
[16:39.860 --> 16:41.240]  The Gerplers might be in the warehouse.
[16:41.360 --> 16:42.620]  Yeah, they, they might be...
[16:42.620 --> 16:44.400]  They might be in the warehouse.
[16:45.000 --> 16:45.980]  Yeah, beginning of July,
[16:46.060 --> 16:47.600]  I think is probably when we're gonna get something going.
[16:47.600 --> 16:49.620]  Oh, the winner house.
[16:50.200 --> 16:50.700]  Jesus Christ.
[16:50.720 --> 16:51.320]  The winner house?
[16:51.600 --> 16:52.140]  The wiener house?
[16:52.220 --> 16:52.600]  Hair house?
[16:52.600 --> 16:53.100]  The wiener house.
[16:53.840 --> 16:54.040]  Yeah.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.520]  All right, boys, it's time.
[16:57.600 --> 16:59.300]  Rolling start, F1 style.
[17:00.120 --> 17:01.500]  I think I might be going blind.
[17:01.680 --> 17:02.560]  I guess it's NASCAR style.
[17:02.580 --> 17:03.400]  Sometimes F1.
[17:03.460 --> 17:04.860]  No, no, no, it's NASCAR style.
[17:05.320 --> 17:06.080]  Here we go, boys.
[17:06.300 --> 17:06.980]  Oh, Jesus.
[17:07.340 --> 17:08.020]  Warm the tires up.
[17:08.080 --> 17:08.820]  Warm the tires up.
[17:10.560 --> 17:11.600]  Everybody's bumping me.
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.000]  Yeah, I'm up to it.
[17:13.060 --> 17:14.480]  Everyone wants to be in first.
[17:14.580 --> 17:15.180]  Yeah, it's weird.
[17:16.180 --> 17:16.580]  Coin!
[17:17.860 --> 17:19.600]  Oh, I could have used some of those.
[17:20.060 --> 17:20.460]  Whoopsie.
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.180]  Brandon up here is DK.
[17:24.880 --> 17:25.280]  Dillkong.
[17:26.040 --> 17:27.020]  Have we got multiple dills?
[17:27.200 --> 17:28.080]  Oh, you know it.
[17:28.740 --> 17:29.300]  Fucked up.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.360]  Shouldn't be more than one.
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.420]  You can tell which dill I am
[17:32.420 --> 17:34.200]  by looking at the back of the pack.
[17:36.080 --> 17:38.600]  I am not good at this game, I just realized.
[17:38.600 --> 17:39.700]  Oh shit, Max.
[17:39.780 --> 17:40.680]  I'm so big.
[17:41.120 --> 17:42.580]  Eat that, eat that, Brandon.
[17:42.820 --> 17:44.100]  Dude, this is messy.
[17:44.220 --> 17:45.380]  Is it Brandon or Braden?
[17:46.740 --> 17:47.520]  Is it Braden?
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.800]  Either way, I gotta run over?
[17:49.540 --> 17:50.480]  Come on, come on, come on.
[17:50.500 --> 17:51.040]  Come on.
[17:51.760 --> 17:53.340]  Oh my God, how am I at 18?
[17:53.540 --> 17:54.220]  This is insane.
[17:54.240 --> 17:55.380]  Somebody's bashing my ass.
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.160]  All right, go to health.
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.860]  All right, let's take this.
[17:58.820 --> 17:59.640]  Oh, where am I going?
[18:00.420 --> 18:01.060]  Oh, shit.
[18:02.860 --> 18:03.700]  Oh my God.
[18:03.800 --> 18:04.720]  I wish I told you who...
[18:04.720 --> 18:06.040]  This is insane.
[18:06.180 --> 18:06.720]  Fuck me.
[18:08.160 --> 18:09.120]  Make it so horny.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.100]  It's because I took my shoes off.
[18:13.100 --> 18:13.920]  Yeah, I was about to say,
[18:14.040 --> 18:15.960]  this is all your fault, Eric.
[18:16.600 --> 18:18.280]  All right, get run over, bitch.
[18:19.000 --> 18:19.960]  Oh, who's the star?
[18:20.060 --> 18:20.400]  They got lucky.
[18:20.840 --> 18:21.380]  Oh, bum.
[18:22.480 --> 18:23.340]  Oh, bum.
[18:26.360 --> 18:27.480]  I need a Yoshi costume.
[18:27.760 --> 18:28.160]  Good job, Eric.
[18:29.180 --> 18:30.660]  I need a Yoshi costume.
[18:31.680 --> 18:32.800]  I'm in 24.
[18:33.280 --> 18:33.400]  Nice.
[18:33.400 --> 18:34.740]  I was back there for a little while.
[18:34.780 --> 18:35.560]  I got real nice.
[18:35.660 --> 18:36.220]  Out of how many?
[18:36.360 --> 18:37.040]  I got 24.
[18:37.600 --> 18:38.800]  I got real gummed up there.
[18:38.880 --> 18:39.740]  Give me something good, baby.
[18:40.620 --> 18:40.980]  Yes.
[18:41.820 --> 18:42.420]  Oh, Nicky.
[18:42.460 --> 18:43.300]  Big boy.
[18:44.080 --> 18:45.340]  Woo-hoo-hoo!
[18:45.680 --> 18:46.640]  How did I get squished?
[18:46.880 --> 18:47.760]  Oh, the ball squished me.
[18:47.860 --> 18:48.360]  Big boy.
[18:49.820 --> 18:51.360]  I've sensed some weather, guys.
[18:51.420 --> 18:51.720]  No!
[18:52.320 --> 18:53.560]  Oh my God.
[18:56.440 --> 18:56.860]  Oh, ball.
[18:56.860 --> 18:58.940]  There's just things flying around the track.
[18:59.580 --> 19:02.000]  I was in first, I'm in 11th.
[19:03.420 --> 19:04.760]  This is insane.
[19:05.300 --> 19:06.400]  Out of the way, dickheads.
[19:06.680 --> 19:08.200]  I was in ninth, I'm in 20th.
[19:08.200 --> 19:08.400]  No!
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.040]  Oh!
[19:14.020 --> 19:15.480]  Oh, I think I hit someone in the leg.
[19:15.760 --> 19:15.880]  Oh, shit.
[19:16.700 --> 19:17.100]  There we go.
[19:17.840 --> 19:18.660]  Still in this thing.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.200]  Let's go, Yoshi.
[19:19.260 --> 19:19.640]  Come on.
[19:19.720 --> 19:21.420]  You get three shells and immediately,
[19:21.660 --> 19:23.200]  just the people get knocked off you.
[19:23.520 --> 19:24.440]  You can't hold anything.
[19:24.620 --> 19:26.060]  No, it's all gone in an instant.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.020]  This is done.
[19:27.100 --> 19:28.160]  Yoshi's first and second.
[19:28.300 --> 19:29.160]  That's right, Yoshi power.
[19:29.280 --> 19:29.760]  Let's go.
[19:32.260 --> 19:33.260]  Kill the Yoshi.
[19:34.180 --> 19:35.500]  Just like Mario does.
[19:39.340 --> 19:41.200]  Prick, get off me, you son of a bitch.
[19:41.200 --> 19:41.620]  You're so slow.
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.620]  You're the booyah, greedy bastard stealer.
[19:43.620 --> 19:44.600]  What am I hitting?
[19:45.140 --> 19:46.500]  Let me go forward.
[19:46.680 --> 19:47.340]  This sucks.
[19:47.360 --> 19:49.040]  You go from like, you go from like,
[19:49.160 --> 19:51.020]  sixth to 21st in one second.
[19:51.660 --> 19:54.380]  Where am I and why is it so fucking slow?
[19:54.700 --> 19:55.620]  What am I doing?
[19:55.700 --> 19:57.740]  Get out of the wall, you frickin' moron.
[19:57.880 --> 19:58.640]  All the way up.
[19:58.820 --> 19:59.480]  Oh, who got?
[20:00.220 --> 20:00.620]  Yay!
[20:03.940 --> 20:05.540]  15, 20 seconds.
[20:05.540 --> 20:08.300]  Dude, I was in first and second.
[20:08.920 --> 20:10.540]  So much of that race.
[20:10.760 --> 20:12.060]  Can we skip the school book?
[20:12.200 --> 20:12.780]  You suck.
[20:12.800 --> 20:13.740]  Oh my God.
[20:14.180 --> 20:15.020]  Is it possible to...
[20:15.020 --> 20:16.640]  Sam is a maniac.
[20:18.560 --> 20:18.960]  Wow.
[20:19.480 --> 20:21.040]  Luckily it doesn't show ours, so.
[20:21.840 --> 20:23.220]  They won't know where we finished.
[20:23.800 --> 20:24.360]  Was that it?
[20:24.920 --> 20:25.180]  What?
[20:26.260 --> 20:26.840]  Uh, yeah, that was...
[20:26.840 --> 20:27.400]  I thought it was four.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.040]  Oh, oh, oh, until next race.
[20:29.120 --> 20:29.620]  Okay, okay, okay.
[20:29.640 --> 20:30.040]  Now we go again.
[20:30.220 --> 20:32.240]  Hey, why don't you pricks turn off auto steering
[20:32.240 --> 20:33.520]  so we can play this fair and square.
[20:34.280 --> 20:35.860]  Do you think anyone's using it?
[20:35.940 --> 20:36.760]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[20:37.020 --> 20:38.940]  Okay, Nick, okay, I'll turn it off.
[20:40.100 --> 20:41.140]  Ooh, Moo Moo Meadows.
[20:42.680 --> 20:43.880]  I'm Moo Moo Meadows all day.
[20:44.020 --> 20:45.680]  Usually I'm a random guy, you know me.
[20:46.000 --> 20:46.540]  But, dude.
[20:47.160 --> 20:47.660]  In the meadows?
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.060]  Wow, Moo got a lot of votes.
[20:49.200 --> 20:49.380]  Yeah.
[20:49.940 --> 20:50.900]  People love the moo.
[20:52.380 --> 20:53.160]  There's so many moos.
[20:53.180 --> 20:53.800]  Up there in Moo Town.
[20:54.820 --> 20:56.880]  Either Moo Moo Meadows or Sea of Thieves.
[20:57.500 --> 20:57.740]  Yeah.
[20:58.100 --> 20:58.680]  What did Jordan say?
[20:59.700 --> 21:00.660]  What did Jordan say?
[21:00.760 --> 21:02.400]  He said, I am not home.
[21:03.860 --> 21:06.600]  How are you on Mario Kart?
[21:08.340 --> 21:08.920]  Holly's playing.
[21:11.980 --> 21:13.100]  Holly's probably playing.
[21:14.460 --> 21:14.840]  Oh my God.
[21:14.940 --> 21:16.660]  All right, Geoff, are you ready for Moo Moo Meadows?
[21:16.740 --> 21:17.080]  I'm ready.
[21:17.180 --> 21:18.540]  Thanks for the sub, Don Tawney.
[21:18.780 --> 21:19.440]  All right, Don Tawney.
[21:20.060 --> 21:21.460]  Yoshi's waving to you, Don Tawney.
[21:21.540 --> 21:21.820]  Hi.
[21:22.440 --> 21:23.880]  Oh, there's a Bowser next to me.
[21:24.200 --> 21:25.040]  Which one is me?
[21:25.220 --> 21:26.380]  Oh, I forgot to hit the button.
[21:28.580 --> 21:29.280]  Out of the way, prick.
[21:29.480 --> 21:30.980]  And I never saw first place again.
[21:30.980 --> 21:31.640]  God dammit.
[21:32.780 --> 21:33.660]  Were you in it for a second?
[21:34.400 --> 21:34.760]  No.
[21:35.180 --> 21:35.900]  I could just see the...
[21:35.900 --> 21:36.380]  He saw it.
[21:36.600 --> 21:36.840]  You could see it.
[21:36.900 --> 21:37.740]  You kept an eye on it.
[21:39.140 --> 21:41.280]  That's what every GTA race was like for me.
[21:43.600 --> 21:44.880]  Oh my God.
[21:45.060 --> 21:45.720]  They're everywhere.
[21:46.260 --> 21:47.120]  Leave me alone.
[21:47.480 --> 21:48.160]  This is so much worse.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.380]  I'm just a little Yoshi.
[21:51.940 --> 21:52.880]  Oh my God.
[21:52.980 --> 21:54.800]  Oh, that car is killing everybody.
[21:55.440 --> 21:56.420]  Oh my God.
[21:56.460 --> 21:57.840]  This is insane.
[21:59.040 --> 21:59.840]  Oh, explosions.
[22:03.120 --> 22:04.640]  God, who ran me over?
[22:04.840 --> 22:05.080]  I did.
[22:05.260 --> 22:06.520]  How come Nascar's not like this?
[22:06.520 --> 22:06.740]  Maybe.
[22:07.180 --> 22:07.800]  Maybe not.
[22:07.960 --> 22:08.300]  Who knows?
[22:09.600 --> 22:10.100]  Maybe not.
[22:10.220 --> 22:10.540]  Maybe not.
[22:10.760 --> 22:12.420]  I ran a lot of people over.
[22:13.120 --> 22:13.860]  You could have been people.
[22:14.280 --> 22:14.600]  I don't know.
[22:14.720 --> 22:15.500]  Am I people?
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.200]  Get something stolen from someone.
[22:17.500 --> 22:17.800]  All right.
[22:18.140 --> 22:19.440]  Oh, steal this, bitch.
[22:19.720 --> 22:20.440]  Shit, shit, bullshit.
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.740]  Who's in first?
[22:21.820 --> 22:22.480]  Go to hell.
[22:23.340 --> 22:24.800]  That was swirled around me for a second.
[22:24.920 --> 22:25.200]  I was in first.
[22:25.200 --> 22:25.760]  Oh my God.
[22:26.300 --> 22:26.740]  Yeah, but it'll kill you.
[22:26.740 --> 22:27.520]  I'm in first.
[22:28.420 --> 22:29.720]  I got a coin.
[22:30.040 --> 22:30.640]  No one hit me.
[22:30.920 --> 22:31.980]  I got a...
[22:31.980 --> 22:33.080]  How did that happen?
[22:33.940 --> 22:35.040]  I'm big now.
[22:35.540 --> 22:35.900]  Yes.
[22:36.220 --> 22:37.520]  You left a feather in the street.
[22:37.980 --> 22:38.620]  Yes.
[22:40.520 --> 22:42.300]  I'm big now.
[22:42.760 --> 22:44.640]  Fuck, you ran me over.
[22:45.180 --> 22:45.580]  No.
[22:46.580 --> 22:47.320]  Eat cock.
[22:48.560 --> 22:49.800]  It wasn't even clever.
[22:53.460 --> 22:54.580]  Oh my God.
[22:54.580 --> 22:56.840]  This is so crazy.
[22:56.900 --> 22:57.580]  Oh, you're such a...
[22:57.580 --> 23:00.160]  Oh, son of a bitch, you're getting an item busted.
[23:01.260 --> 23:02.840]  Dude, if you're playing with us right now,
[23:02.900 --> 23:03.880]  thank you for joining us.
[23:03.880 --> 23:04.700]  Thank you so much.
[23:04.880 --> 23:06.900]  This is so much fun.
[23:07.120 --> 23:09.400]  If you're one of the 19 people
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.680]  delivering us a beating right now, thank you so much.
[23:11.700 --> 23:12.940]  Thank you and go to hell.
[23:13.960 --> 23:15.200]  All right, now we got an item.
[23:15.480 --> 23:15.880]  Boosted.
[23:16.060 --> 23:16.520]  There it is.
[23:16.660 --> 23:17.520]  Gold shell.
[23:18.700 --> 23:19.380]  I'm big now.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.240]  Oh my God.
[23:21.520 --> 23:22.140]  Get me up there.
[23:22.160 --> 23:22.940]  Get me up there.
[23:22.960 --> 23:23.300]  There we go.
[23:23.760 --> 23:24.600]  Get me up there.
[23:25.540 --> 23:26.260]  Get him up.
[23:27.260 --> 23:28.700]  Wow, first place is up there.
[23:29.940 --> 23:31.000]  Oh yeah, they're killing it.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.280]  No, you ostrich bastard.
[23:34.500 --> 23:34.940]  Fuck.
[23:37.080 --> 23:37.600]  Come on.
[23:37.860 --> 23:38.620]  Oh, you're such...
[23:39.200 --> 23:39.640]  You're...
[23:41.200 --> 23:41.640]  Yeah.
[23:43.220 --> 23:44.200]  That's what I'm thinking.
[23:44.240 --> 23:44.480]  No.
[23:45.080 --> 23:46.800]  We recorded some drafts today
[23:46.800 --> 23:48.820]  that are maybe some of the best that we've ever done.
[23:49.120 --> 23:49.620]  Oh, wow.
[23:49.640 --> 23:50.500]  That's a bold statement.
[23:50.500 --> 23:53.640]  I think they had some really incredible moments
[23:54.760 --> 23:56.800]  in these drafts that were so awesome.
[23:57.080 --> 23:57.660]  10, come on, come on.
[23:57.980 --> 23:59.000]  God damn it.
[23:59.900 --> 24:02.140]  I think I finished 11th?
[24:02.340 --> 24:03.560]  I got better than 24th.
[24:04.340 --> 24:05.780]  Better than 23rd.
[24:06.880 --> 24:07.400]  Wow.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.860]  Dude, I'm 12th.
[24:10.400 --> 24:10.920]  12th.
[24:12.160 --> 24:12.680]  Goodness.
[24:12.940 --> 24:14.060]  Marksley, up there.
[24:14.200 --> 24:15.300]  Sam's still up there.
[24:16.140 --> 24:16.520]  Damn.
[24:17.100 --> 24:18.600]  None of us even top 10, boys.
[24:18.760 --> 24:19.500]  No, I was fifth.
[24:20.700 --> 24:21.140]  No.
[24:21.440 --> 24:21.780]  You were?
[24:22.340 --> 24:22.720]  Wasn't I?
[24:22.980 --> 24:23.680]  Yeah, I think you were.
[24:24.920 --> 24:25.740]  Nah, I don't think so.
[24:25.760 --> 24:26.760]  Someone confirm or deny.
[24:27.180 --> 24:27.620]  Deny.
[24:29.360 --> 24:32.360]  I like hitting the L button when I have no...
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.340]  There's an ostrich on my head.
[24:33.360 --> 24:33.880]  You just wave.
[24:34.120 --> 24:35.020]  Hey, if you're watching this
[24:35.020 --> 24:36.140]  and you're thinking about how much fun
[24:36.140 --> 24:38.380]  you're having watching us play Mario Kart
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.620]  or playing with us right now,
[24:40.100 --> 24:42.220]  you would have even more fun tonight
[24:42.220 --> 24:45.360]  at 9 p.m. central time, 9.30 p.m. central time
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.740]  when we play Sloppy Joe's Bingo with you.
[24:48.140 --> 24:49.240]  That's Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[24:49.240 --> 24:50.020]  That's tonight.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.220]  Right here at 9.30.
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.520]  Right here on this couch.
[24:52.620 --> 24:53.420]  We're doing it from the office.
[24:53.660 --> 24:53.780]  We are.
[24:54.260 --> 24:54.660]  Excited.
[24:54.740 --> 24:55.720]  Nobody wants to leave.
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.540]  We came to work today and nobody wants to go home now.
[24:58.520 --> 24:59.220]  We've been here all day.
[24:59.680 --> 25:00.000]  It's true.
[25:00.560 --> 25:01.360]  Love and life.
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.280]  My wife filed a missing persons report.
[25:03.860 --> 25:04.260]  Really?
[25:05.160 --> 25:05.400]  No.
[25:06.520 --> 25:06.920]  What?
[25:07.020 --> 25:07.500]  That's on tomorrow.
[25:07.680 --> 25:08.420]  That was a lie?
[25:09.400 --> 25:09.640]  Yeah.
[25:10.000 --> 25:10.520]  Can you believe it?
[25:10.640 --> 25:11.020]  No.
[25:11.960 --> 25:12.580]  All right, boys.
[25:13.500 --> 25:14.180]  Let's see.
[25:18.520 --> 25:18.920]  Random...
[25:18.920 --> 25:20.300]  Oh my God.
[25:21.100 --> 25:21.820]  Donkey Kong.
[25:22.080 --> 25:22.720]  What the hell?
[25:22.920 --> 25:24.060]  Big metal Dilkonk.
[25:24.100 --> 25:24.380]  Yep.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.080]  It's big monkey mode.
[25:26.320 --> 25:29.060]  Oh, it's Dilkonk space work.
[25:29.720 --> 25:30.800]  Oh, this level's awesome.
[25:30.860 --> 25:31.840]  We played this earlier, Geoff.
[25:32.400 --> 25:32.920]  Oh yeah.
[25:33.240 --> 25:33.560]  Hell yeah.
[25:33.660 --> 25:34.180]  It's a good one.
[25:35.560 --> 25:36.960]  I really like this game.
[25:37.100 --> 25:38.700]  I think this is a really great Mario Kart.
[25:39.040 --> 25:39.800]  It's super fun.
[25:40.140 --> 25:40.600]  Yeah, it's fun.
[25:40.740 --> 25:41.480]  Dude, it's real good.
[25:41.820 --> 25:42.740]  I'm waving to you, chat.
[25:44.960 --> 25:45.280]  No, wait.
[25:45.440 --> 25:45.880]  I'm waving to you.
[25:46.100 --> 25:46.820]  Oh shit, I wasn't looking.
[25:46.880 --> 25:47.420]  Oh, me neither.
[25:47.540 --> 25:47.800]  Shit.
[25:48.340 --> 25:48.880]  Oh, we got it though.
[25:49.900 --> 25:51.500]  I got a little one.
[25:53.500 --> 25:54.580]  I've heard of that.
[25:56.380 --> 25:57.180]  Oh, oh shit.
[25:57.760 --> 25:58.540]  I went straight off.
[25:58.560 --> 25:59.780]  How do we both do that?
[25:59.900 --> 26:00.460]  Oh, we suck.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.180]  I didn't get an item for that either.
[26:03.960 --> 26:04.520]  Punished me.
[26:09.700 --> 26:10.360]  All right, here we go.
[26:11.440 --> 26:11.960]  Here we go.
[26:12.000 --> 26:12.840]  Yoshi, come back to her.
[26:12.860 --> 26:13.280]  Here we go.
[26:13.420 --> 26:14.320]  Yoshi, come back to her.
[26:15.180 --> 26:15.660]  Mario Kart.
[26:15.660 --> 26:16.740]  I just want to be top 15.
[26:17.060 --> 26:17.700]  That's the goal.
[26:17.860 --> 26:18.380]  Yeah, no kidding.
[26:19.020 --> 26:20.420]  I ran right into the wall.
[26:21.180 --> 26:21.560]  Sweet.
[26:21.980 --> 26:22.860]  Drove right into the wall.
[26:23.040 --> 26:24.660]  Don't run over the green bit.
[26:25.820 --> 26:26.660]  You mean grass?
[26:27.400 --> 26:29.200]  I don't think it's grass in this universe.
[26:29.480 --> 26:30.160]  Stay off the green bit.
[26:35.140 --> 26:36.900]  God, it's so hot to get back to the front.
[26:38.260 --> 26:39.760]  I'm in 20 seconds still.
[26:39.900 --> 26:40.840]  Oh, I'm on the Lego.
[26:41.780 --> 26:42.580]  Whoa, blue shell!
[26:43.500 --> 26:44.380]  Go, go, go, go.
[26:46.800 --> 26:47.140]  Oh!
[26:47.520 --> 26:48.220]  Top 10!
[26:50.820 --> 26:51.560]  Oh!
[26:53.220 --> 26:53.960]  Unnecessary.
[26:54.840 --> 26:55.740]  Oh no!
[26:56.580 --> 26:57.740]  Stop taking it, IBS!
[26:59.560 --> 27:00.300]  No!
[27:00.820 --> 27:01.060]  Yes!
[27:01.380 --> 27:03.880]  Oh, I missed the fucking thing, shit!
[27:04.900 --> 27:06.080]  I missed it again!
[27:09.100 --> 27:11.020]  What the hell was that?
[27:13.400 --> 27:13.660]  No!
[27:15.900 --> 27:18.200]  Oh, bananas!
[27:18.200 --> 27:18.780]  I'm in a peel.
[27:19.480 --> 27:20.440]  I'm huge!
[27:21.860 --> 27:23.580]  All right, don't brag about it.
[27:26.180 --> 27:27.220]  Oh, I'm behind Andrew.
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.620]  Oh, I'm squishing.
[27:30.080 --> 27:31.140]  Oh, I'm sucking wool.
[27:31.360 --> 27:32.620]  Get off the wall, you moron idiot!
[27:34.600 --> 27:35.080]  Okay.
[27:35.760 --> 27:36.200]  No!
[27:37.740 --> 27:38.200]  Come on.
[27:38.660 --> 27:40.360]  Oh, no, no, no, no, shit!
[27:41.380 --> 27:41.700]  Top 15!
[27:41.700 --> 27:42.060]  No!
[27:43.360 --> 27:43.840]  No!
[27:44.500 --> 27:44.980]  No!
[27:46.140 --> 27:46.260]  No!
[27:46.520 --> 27:46.600]  No!
[27:47.460 --> 27:47.500]  No!
[27:47.500 --> 27:48.960]  Seventh place!
[27:50.100 --> 27:51.100]  Seventh place!
[27:51.740 --> 27:52.840]  I'm falling apart!
[27:53.000 --> 27:53.800]  I'm off the screen!
[27:57.960 --> 27:59.100]  Gavin, is that you in 10?
[28:00.720 --> 28:01.920]  I'm off the screen!
[28:10.960 --> 28:11.460]  Brutal.
[28:12.320 --> 28:12.820]  Brutal.
[28:15.500 --> 28:16.320]  Oh my God.
[28:16.340 --> 28:17.100]  Redemption race!
[28:17.480 --> 28:18.360]  This could be it!
[28:18.960 --> 28:20.380]  It all comes down to this.
[28:25.740 --> 28:27.060]  Here we go!
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.860]  Okay, whistle stop, random.
[28:29.860 --> 28:30.720]  I'm random.
[28:30.920 --> 28:31.600]  Oh, fuck.
[28:34.620 --> 28:36.440]  I want to apologize if you were on headphones
[28:36.440 --> 28:38.980]  during the last 35 seconds of the stream.
[28:39.160 --> 28:40.560]  Maybe 35 minutes, but yeah.
[28:40.560 --> 28:41.840]  Thanks for the subs, Denise Craft.
[28:41.940 --> 28:42.720]  You're a fucking hero.
[28:43.700 --> 28:45.040]  Oh my God, we love you.
[28:45.040 --> 28:45.960]  Oh, thank you so much.
[28:48.960 --> 28:49.700]  No, my coins.
[28:51.940 --> 28:53.860]  This is crazy.
[28:56.360 --> 28:58.100]  I'm just out on the sea.
[28:58.700 --> 28:59.100]  Yeah.
[29:03.180 --> 29:04.220]  All right.
[29:05.580 --> 29:06.920]  Is it Choco Mountain?
[29:07.640 --> 29:07.860]  Fucking hell.
[29:10.860 --> 29:12.120]  Oh, whistle stop, Summit.
[29:12.540 --> 29:13.680]  It shouldn't be legal to laugh this much.
[29:14.440 --> 29:15.620]  Whistle stop, Summit boys.
[29:16.140 --> 29:17.880]  All right, this is redemption race.
[29:17.880 --> 29:20.000]  I got 19 points for here comes first place.
[29:20.080 --> 29:20.940]  Wave to him, Yoshi.
[29:23.340 --> 29:24.600]  Sick of it.
[29:32.800 --> 29:34.440]  Oh, Andrew's howling.
[29:34.580 --> 29:35.800]  Andrew's on the prowl.
[29:38.860 --> 29:42.100]  I would say there's maybe a 30% chance I get an item.
[29:43.960 --> 29:45.960]  I'm just constantly on someone's backside.
[29:46.840 --> 29:48.180]  I feel like you're killing it again.
[29:49.320 --> 29:50.360]  With Gavin over here bragging.
[29:52.540 --> 29:54.060]  Give me one, give me one.
[29:54.400 --> 29:56.860]  Oh, I went off the fucking map to get mine.
[29:57.260 --> 29:57.680]  Bye, Gavin.
[29:58.180 --> 29:59.360]  What did you hit me with?
[29:59.440 --> 30:00.000]  A red shell.
[30:00.260 --> 30:00.460]  17.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.340]  Oh my God, 17?
[30:06.400 --> 30:06.800]  Oh my God.
[30:06.800 --> 30:08.560]  Well, yeah, I just did like fifth.
[30:09.460 --> 30:10.980]  How'd I get back into this shit hole?
[30:11.020 --> 30:11.860]  Oh my God.
[30:12.060 --> 30:13.120]  Eat bloop.
[30:13.800 --> 30:14.760]  Oh my God.
[30:15.260 --> 30:16.040]  Bullet Bill.
[30:16.040 --> 30:16.920]  It's me.
[30:17.020 --> 30:17.880]  I'm Bullet Bill.
[30:18.100 --> 30:18.880]  Coming through.
[30:19.460 --> 30:20.020]  Yeah.
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.500]  Big monkey coming through.
[30:22.220 --> 30:23.360]  Big dildo coming through.
[30:23.440 --> 30:24.580]  Oh, dog shit.
[30:25.380 --> 30:26.460]  Oh, you prick.
[30:26.760 --> 30:27.460]  You useless.
[30:27.820 --> 30:28.140]  All right.
[30:31.440 --> 30:32.000]  Who?
[30:32.260 --> 30:33.500]  What's a feather do?
[30:33.780 --> 30:34.700]  Make you jump.
[30:35.720 --> 30:36.300]  Jump high, good.
[30:36.660 --> 30:37.160]  Make you look.
[30:38.400 --> 30:39.340]  I'm back in 17th.
[30:39.340 --> 30:40.860]  It is just pissing coins.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.940]  Fucking hell, who ran me over?
[30:44.240 --> 30:44.800]  Everybody.
[30:44.800 --> 30:46.760]  At least that's what it felt like to me.
[30:48.860 --> 30:50.420]  Stop, I'm trying to kill Brandon.
[30:52.140 --> 30:52.660]  For Mahini?
[30:53.120 --> 30:53.580]  Yeah.
[30:54.400 --> 30:55.500]  Yeah, he's in a way mode.
[30:59.940 --> 31:01.720]  Might take care of it for you.
[31:04.440 --> 31:05.600]  Star coming through.
[31:06.860 --> 31:07.400]  Yeah, me.
[31:08.760 --> 31:09.200]  Oh.
[31:10.540 --> 31:11.980]  I got bombed.
[31:12.340 --> 31:12.920]  I was on the run.
[31:12.920 --> 31:13.440]  Oh, I got squashed.
[31:13.440 --> 31:15.300]  I was on the run of a lifetime.
[31:17.060 --> 31:18.200]  No, the tree.
[31:19.080 --> 31:19.540]  Oh, no.
[31:21.950 --> 31:22.750]  Holy fuck.
[31:25.650 --> 31:27.410]  It took me out of line.
[31:27.430 --> 31:27.830]  Here we go.
[31:28.230 --> 31:30.790]  I had so much shit in my fucking tongue.
[31:31.810 --> 31:32.770]  Oh my God.
[31:33.170 --> 31:33.570]  Fucking hell.
[31:33.610 --> 31:35.010]  Fifth place for the mole.
[31:35.470 --> 31:38.030]  Twenty-fourth place.
[31:38.370 --> 31:39.230]  20th for Gavin.
[31:39.330 --> 31:42.790]  Twenty-fourth place.
[31:42.790 --> 31:46.430]  I think it went 24, 5, 24, 20.
[31:51.650 --> 31:53.030]  Brutalized at the end.
[31:55.050 --> 31:56.450]  Absolutely brutalized at the end.
[31:56.790 --> 31:57.530]  Don't clap for me.
[31:57.530 --> 31:59.330]  Don't you do that, you son of a bitch.
[32:01.410 --> 32:02.730]  Me and Andrew finished.
[32:03.030 --> 32:03.510]  Oh, we tied.
[32:03.890 --> 32:05.110]  Oh, I tied with Gavin.
[32:05.410 --> 32:06.570]  I tied with Gavin.
[32:06.630 --> 32:07.790]  Me and Andrew are tied.
[32:08.370 --> 32:10.130]  You should feel so bad about that.
[32:10.130 --> 32:11.090]  No, you tied with Nick.
[32:11.170 --> 32:11.890]  I tied with Nick.
[32:11.890 --> 32:13.230]  You should feel so bad about that.
[32:14.170 --> 32:15.270]  Look at what I'm playing on.
[32:15.890 --> 32:16.490]  Well, that's true.
[32:16.730 --> 32:17.470]  Oh my God.
[32:17.630 --> 32:18.370]  Hang on, let me get this peach one.
[32:18.370 --> 32:20.090]  You mean the Switch 2 like I don't have?
[32:20.210 --> 32:20.290]  Yeah.
[32:21.270 --> 32:22.390]  Should we get right into it?
[32:22.490 --> 32:23.330]  Yeah, absolutely.
[32:24.070 --> 32:24.970]  It's not 5.01.
[32:25.270 --> 32:25.710]  No, not yet.
[32:25.750 --> 32:26.350]  What time is it?
[32:26.390 --> 32:29.110]  It's been a few minutes since I promoted our second stream.
[32:29.330 --> 32:32.390]  Don't forget tonight at 9.30 p.m. Central Time.
[32:32.690 --> 32:33.770]  Do you want to let different people play?
[32:33.870 --> 32:34.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:34.410 --> 32:36.730]  If you guys want to, if you can drop off,
[32:36.770 --> 32:39.130]  if you just played and we can get some new people in,
[32:39.270 --> 32:40.770]  that would be very cool.
[32:40.770 --> 32:42.470]  You give it a minute, we're still looking,
[32:42.610 --> 32:43.110]  then come back.
[32:43.110 --> 32:43.270]  There you go.
[32:43.850 --> 32:44.590]  Here's the room info.
[32:44.830 --> 32:46.650]  We really appreciate everyone who played that first game.
[32:46.710 --> 32:48.910]  That's the first time I played Mario Kart online.
[32:49.070 --> 32:50.630]  The only thing I think we could appreciate more
[32:50.630 --> 32:53.350]  is if people showed up tonight at 9.30 Central Time
[32:53.350 --> 32:54.510]  to play Sloppy Joe's Bingo with us.
[32:54.530 --> 32:55.490]  It's true, it's true.
[32:55.510 --> 32:57.090]  It's just a play with us kind of day.
[32:57.150 --> 32:58.610]  Look at the people who dropped off.
[32:58.670 --> 32:59.230]  That's so nice.
[32:59.430 --> 33:00.050]  That's really awesome.
[33:00.210 --> 33:01.190]  Do we have a printer in the office?
[33:01.490 --> 33:01.810]  No.
[33:02.050 --> 33:02.830]  It's 2025.
[33:03.330 --> 33:04.110]  Why do you need a printer?
[33:04.890 --> 33:05.450]  Bingo cart.
[33:05.470 --> 33:05.930]  Use your phone.
[33:07.290 --> 33:08.110]  Use your phone.
[33:08.110 --> 33:10.810]  Are you fucking manually writing your bingo cards?
[33:11.270 --> 33:12.650]  I have a computer usually.
[33:12.790 --> 33:14.490]  I'm sitting here on the couch this time.
[33:14.570 --> 33:15.090]  Use your phone.
[33:15.090 --> 33:15.730]  Why are you looking at your phone?
[33:16.250 --> 33:17.590]  I think you're a bingo writer.
[33:18.210 --> 33:19.770]  I think he's a bingo writer.
[33:19.930 --> 33:20.650]  All right, join us.
[33:20.770 --> 33:20.990]  Let's see.
[33:21.130 --> 33:21.510]  Is that the app?
[33:21.870 --> 33:23.070]  GDUF, DROSAPP.
[33:23.330 --> 33:24.150]  Is that a fat?
[33:25.870 --> 33:26.270]  Dankenstein.
[33:29.550 --> 33:30.350]  Dankenstein rocks.
[33:31.150 --> 33:37.090]  Oh, the Dr. Mouse.
[33:37.090 --> 33:37.910]  The Dr. Mouse?
[33:37.970 --> 33:40.170]  The Dr. Mouse, you guessed it a bunch of times last week.
[33:40.190 --> 33:42.270]  It's not Dr. Mouse, it's Drunken Mouse.
[33:42.530 --> 33:42.770]  What?
[33:43.350 --> 33:44.930]  The DR stands for drunk.
[33:44.970 --> 33:46.870]  And he collapsed, it's yellow green.
[33:46.890 --> 33:48.590]  Here's why, because back in the old days,
[33:48.590 --> 33:49.930]  you would take your mouse ball out
[33:49.930 --> 33:52.870]  and you would clean it with alcohol,
[33:53.550 --> 33:56.110]  and you would call it getting your mouse drunk.
[33:57.270 --> 33:57.630]  Drunkenacular.
[33:58.430 --> 33:58.790]  What do you think?
[33:59.430 --> 34:00.150]  Oh shit, do it.
[34:00.170 --> 34:01.190]  What does Frantic do?
[34:01.790 --> 34:02.970]  What do you think Frantic does?
[34:03.230 --> 34:05.810]  Shout out to everyone who just stopped playing with us.
[34:05.810 --> 34:06.830]  Yeah, that was so, that was-
[34:06.830 --> 34:09.010]  I did not think that would work, but it's legendary.
[34:09.470 --> 34:11.550]  Like, truly really great of you to do that
[34:11.550 --> 34:12.530]  and give other people a shot.
[34:12.630 --> 34:14.090]  That's so, that's so nice.
[34:14.530 --> 34:15.450]  Yeah, the Drunk Mouse.
[34:15.770 --> 34:16.310]  All right, let's see.
[34:16.490 --> 34:17.570]  Oh, hey, guy like me?
[34:17.690 --> 34:17.870]  Random.
[34:18.250 --> 34:18.610]  Random.
[34:19.530 --> 34:19.890]  Goddamnit.
[34:19.890 --> 34:20.570]  Most of us are just cows.
[34:20.790 --> 34:21.370]  Nick, are we random?
[34:21.630 --> 34:21.810]  Yeah.
[34:22.090 --> 34:22.270]  Random.
[34:22.990 --> 34:23.350]  Ooh.
[34:23.370 --> 34:24.230]  I've gotta go random.
[34:24.690 --> 34:26.670]  Ooh, somebody got the Moo Moo Meadows choice up there.
[34:26.770 --> 34:27.630]  I like that.
[34:27.790 --> 34:28.410]  It's on the board.
[34:29.130 --> 34:31.130]  It's on the board, could be a Moo Moo Meadow.
[34:33.530 --> 34:34.130]  Go to some-
[34:34.130 --> 34:34.830]  Goddamnit.
[34:34.830 --> 34:35.930]  Go to some Moos.
[34:37.410 --> 34:38.710]  Hunt some cows.
[34:39.850 --> 34:40.110]  Ah!
[34:40.730 --> 34:41.170]  I ran.
[34:41.430 --> 34:42.530]  Oh, oh, oh!
[34:43.070 --> 34:45.550]  I'm so glad I'm not on the televised switch.
[34:45.830 --> 34:47.110]  It does not feel good.
[34:47.550 --> 34:48.950]  Hey, does not feel good, buddy.
[34:49.890 --> 34:50.670]  All right, you ready?
[34:50.790 --> 34:51.290]  Let's do this.
[34:51.410 --> 34:51.890]  All right, boys.
[34:52.010 --> 34:52.790]  Crown City.
[34:53.070 --> 34:54.430]  Here we go, new race.
[34:54.590 --> 34:56.490]  The Dr. Mouse is here.
[34:57.970 --> 34:59.550]  And Dr. Squid, who might be-
[34:59.550 --> 35:00.690]  And the Drunken Squid.
[35:00.690 --> 35:00.850]  Yeah.
[35:02.530 --> 35:04.350]  I got my money on Dankenstein.
[35:05.410 --> 35:06.210]  Point to him, Yoshi.
[35:06.670 --> 35:07.490]  Wave at him, Yoshi.
[35:09.330 --> 35:10.030]  Let's lock in there.
[35:10.350 --> 35:10.710]  Are you ready?
[35:10.970 --> 35:11.210]  Yep.
[35:11.970 --> 35:12.710]  Here we go, boys.
[35:13.930 --> 35:14.390]  Woo-hoo!
[35:14.390 --> 35:14.990]  I hit it wrong.
[35:17.310 --> 35:18.930]  I didn't get a fucking item!
[35:18.930 --> 35:20.010]  First place, end it!
[35:20.070 --> 35:20.330]  I'm first, I'm first!
[35:20.750 --> 35:21.110]  Goddamnit.
[35:21.190 --> 35:21.590]  I missed.
[35:21.650 --> 35:23.610]  You know the difference between what you did and what I did?
[35:23.750 --> 35:24.670]  I make this look good.
[35:24.690 --> 35:25.450]  About 16 places.
[35:25.850 --> 35:27.310]  Oh, shit, nevermind.
[35:27.410 --> 35:29.270]  I just drove slightly off the track and I'm in 13th.
[35:29.270 --> 35:32.410]  Yeah, me and Dankenstein are back here, 24th and 23rd.
[35:32.690 --> 35:35.750]  Yeah, I went from first to second to like 17th in two seconds.
[35:37.490 --> 35:39.350]  Kark, Dankenstein, help me attack everyone.
[35:39.490 --> 35:39.770]  Fuck.
[35:40.290 --> 35:41.230]  Dankenstein, attack!
[35:42.530 --> 35:43.450]  Dankenstein, you're free.
[35:44.810 --> 35:45.310]  Give me stuff!
[35:45.310 --> 35:46.010]  Return to Dankenstein!
[35:47.030 --> 35:50.330]  Hey, that Frankenstein machine in Vegas treated me real well.
[35:50.390 --> 35:51.030]  Yeah, Dankenstein.
[35:51.570 --> 35:52.210]  Did you make some buns?
[35:52.510 --> 35:52.870]  I did.
[35:53.010 --> 35:54.730]  I won my brother a hundred-something bucks
[35:54.730 --> 35:55.590]  and then I won myself a hundred-something bucks.
[35:55.590 --> 35:58.110]  I haven't gotten an item in this entire race.
[35:58.610 --> 36:01.170]  You're a much better brother than I would be.
[36:01.330 --> 36:02.930]  I wouldn't make myself $200
[36:02.930 --> 36:04.830]  and tell my brother unfortunately things.
[36:04.930 --> 36:05.810]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[36:05.970 --> 36:09.050]  I said, if it keeps going and it gets to 500, it's my money.
[36:10.430 --> 36:11.610]  And it was my money.
[36:11.610 --> 36:12.250]  Oh, boys.
[36:12.510 --> 36:14.230]  Dr. Drunken Mouse, horn!
[36:14.470 --> 36:15.630]  I'm having a bad time.
[36:15.850 --> 36:16.210]  He horned you?
[36:16.410 --> 36:17.370]  Yeah, he gave me the horn.
[36:17.690 --> 36:18.450]  You prick!
[36:19.070 --> 36:19.510]  You...
[36:19.970 --> 36:20.630]  He ran me over.
[36:21.470 --> 36:22.350]  Dankenstein's massive.
[36:23.950 --> 36:25.370]  I'm such dog shit.
[36:28.790 --> 36:29.810]  Please, sir, I want to go for it.
[36:29.850 --> 36:30.310]  Here we go.
[36:30.430 --> 36:31.890]  It's giving me a lot of charity stars.
[36:33.650 --> 36:36.210]  I've never seen a star and I'm in 24th place.
[36:41.740 --> 36:42.100]  No!
[36:42.620 --> 36:43.320]  Yoshi costume!
[36:44.520 --> 36:45.860]  Ah, I'm Red Racer Yoshi.
[36:45.980 --> 36:46.500]  He sucks.
[36:50.290 --> 36:52.410]  Dude, me and Dankenstein all the way up here now.
[36:55.610 --> 36:56.770]  Oh, why me?
[36:57.150 --> 36:57.510]  Shit!
[36:58.090 --> 36:59.250]  Oh, what'd I get hit by?
[36:59.250 --> 37:00.170]  Oh, I got whimed.
[37:00.370 --> 37:01.250]  That was a cloned muscle.
[37:01.410 --> 37:02.410]  Oh, here comes a blue shell!
[37:04.210 --> 37:05.610]  The way Gavin said, why me?
[37:05.650 --> 37:07.010]  It sounded like he forgot his lines.
[37:11.210 --> 37:13.770]  Andrew in 23rd knocked me into 24th.
[37:16.570 --> 37:17.550]  Here we go, here we go.
[37:18.190 --> 37:18.570]  Ow!
[37:18.750 --> 37:19.430]  There we go.
[37:20.170 --> 37:20.970]  Flippin' moron.
[37:21.350 --> 37:22.090]  Ooh, I'm slapped.
[37:22.430 --> 37:22.790]  Oh!
[37:24.210 --> 37:25.010]  You prick!
[37:25.570 --> 37:27.250]  Oh, I'm tripping over everyone's bullshit!
[37:28.310 --> 37:31.330]  There's so much bullshit from the life you left in the street.
[37:31.590 --> 37:32.830]  Clean up after yourselves.
[37:35.670 --> 37:37.430]  No, I jumped on someone's head off!
[37:39.210 --> 37:40.350]  Oh, please let me.
[37:40.750 --> 37:41.850]  Something good, something good, something good.
[37:42.050 --> 37:44.190]  Yes, give me, yes, yes, yes!
[37:45.090 --> 37:46.530]  Come on, baby, come on!
[37:47.590 --> 37:48.110]  Blue shell!
[37:48.810 --> 37:48.910]  Oh!
[37:50.770 --> 37:50.970]  No!
[37:52.690 --> 37:54.050]  Give me beans, give me beans!
[37:54.190 --> 37:54.490]  Please!
[37:54.490 --> 37:55.050]  Give me beans!
[37:57.350 --> 37:59.090]  Give me beans, give me beans, give me beans!
[37:59.770 --> 38:00.490]  Feed me!
[38:03.710 --> 38:05.350]  Get the item, fuckstick!
[38:08.330 --> 38:09.510]  Come on, come on!
[38:09.510 --> 38:10.710]  No, the coin, no!
[38:10.910 --> 38:11.510]  Come on!
[38:12.490 --> 38:13.210]  Oh, shit!
[38:14.370 --> 38:14.730]  17th!
[38:14.730 --> 38:15.410]  Damn, son of a bitch.
[38:16.470 --> 38:18.510]  Oh my god, this is brutal.
[38:18.570 --> 38:19.970]  We got a whole new batch of folks
[38:19.970 --> 38:21.170]  and I think they know how to play.
[38:21.270 --> 38:22.750]  These guys are way better than the last group.
[38:22.830 --> 38:23.830]  Oh, this sucks.
[38:23.990 --> 38:25.590]  Me and Dankenstein, neck and neck.
[38:25.590 --> 38:27.890]  Oh, Braxerman says, hello.
[38:28.570 --> 38:28.990]  Hello.
[38:29.190 --> 38:29.630]  Hi.
[38:30.170 --> 38:30.650]  Hiya.
[38:31.050 --> 38:32.710]  Nice to see you.
[38:34.310 --> 38:35.270]  Ouch, 23rd.
[38:35.830 --> 38:36.550]  All right, here we go.
[38:36.830 --> 38:37.690]  Close, Geoff, close.
[38:38.390 --> 38:39.090]  The other me.
[38:39.330 --> 38:40.070]  This is crazy.
[38:40.270 --> 38:40.590]  What time is it?
[38:41.550 --> 38:42.410]  Military time, huh?
[38:43.050 --> 38:43.690]  No, just the time.
[38:45.530 --> 38:46.430]  24 hours in a day.
[38:47.670 --> 38:48.150]  What?
[38:48.430 --> 38:50.110]  Oh, I forgot you could say stuff.
[38:50.610 --> 38:52.610]  So, you don't believe in the adage
[38:52.610 --> 38:54.650]  of stop cause war twice a day?
[38:54.650 --> 38:55.370]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[38:55.370 --> 38:57.070]  Yeah, hey, hey, you don't believe in that?
[38:57.270 --> 39:00.230]  Stop clock is right twice a day.
[39:00.270 --> 39:02.150]  Start clock, dig it, written day?
[39:02.370 --> 39:03.410]  Yeah, cause 16 is four.
[39:05.210 --> 39:05.570]  What?
[39:06.110 --> 39:07.030]  Cause 16 is four.
[39:07.570 --> 39:09.550]  16 is the same as four, so you'd still be right twice a day.
[39:09.670 --> 39:11.030]  Yeah, you simply can't look at the time.
[39:11.130 --> 39:12.710]  You have to think about it.
[39:13.050 --> 39:13.430]  Isn't that fun?
[39:13.910 --> 39:14.770]  You don't have to think about anything.
[39:15.930 --> 39:16.910]  16 is just four.
[39:17.750 --> 39:18.470]  16 is...
[39:18.470 --> 39:19.130]  Who hasn't chosen?
[39:19.190 --> 39:19.930]  You got Terrence Howard over here.
[39:20.870 --> 39:21.230]  16.
[39:21.230 --> 39:21.570]  16.
[39:23.830 --> 39:24.690]  Let's see what's down here.
[39:25.870 --> 39:27.070]  That is really fucking funny, Andrew.
[39:27.170 --> 39:27.810]  Yeah, I like it.
[39:28.670 --> 39:29.390]  Where are we going?
[39:32.810 --> 39:33.450]  Safari jam.
[39:36.050 --> 39:37.450]  God, take that, shy guys.
[39:37.970 --> 39:38.590]  Not so shy now.
[39:40.310 --> 39:41.570]  Far away oasis.
[39:42.970 --> 39:44.030]  Geoff has one point.
[39:44.270 --> 39:44.510]  Yeah.
[39:44.790 --> 39:45.430]  It's okay, I have eight.
[39:45.470 --> 39:46.790]  Off to a slow start.
[39:46.830 --> 39:48.310]  That's okay, I need you to get first in this next one.
[39:48.350 --> 39:48.730]  Right, Andrew?
[39:48.990 --> 39:49.310]  Yeah.
[39:50.710 --> 39:51.670]  I'm gonna get second.
[39:54.130 --> 39:54.750]  Hi, Yoshi.
[39:57.930 --> 39:59.350]  All right, I didn't blow it that time, Gavin.
[39:59.750 --> 40:01.030]  All right, we're in for a shot here.
[40:01.250 --> 40:01.750]  Oh, nevermind.
[40:01.970 --> 40:02.590]  I just missed the item.
[40:03.870 --> 40:04.450]  Bad start.
[40:04.650 --> 40:07.550]  Oh, someone got a bullet bill in like third.
[40:07.750 --> 40:08.910]  I think they're just in the map.
[40:09.350 --> 40:09.510]  Oh.
[40:15.210 --> 40:15.570]  Ow.
[40:16.450 --> 40:17.170]  Something good.
[40:17.890 --> 40:18.250]  Dumbass.
[40:18.510 --> 40:18.870]  Ow!
[40:20.890 --> 40:22.830]  Someone's dropping shrooms like crazy.
[40:23.610 --> 40:23.710]  Ow.
[40:24.110 --> 40:24.270]  Oh!
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.480]  Sorry, Crispy, it had to be done.
[40:33.620 --> 40:35.100]  Is that you?
[40:35.920 --> 40:36.360]  Stop!
[40:36.780 --> 40:36.940]  Bye!
[40:37.260 --> 40:38.380]  What the fuck?
[40:39.920 --> 40:40.820]  Oh, I missed.
[40:41.900 --> 40:42.680]  Don't shoot me, please.
[40:43.020 --> 40:43.640]  Oh, no.
[40:44.100 --> 40:45.200]  Bad news for Yoshi.
[40:46.540 --> 40:47.680]  23rd place.
[40:48.720 --> 40:49.800]  Ah, you dick!
[40:49.800 --> 40:50.700]  Oh, Alex!
[40:50.700 --> 40:52.440]  Alex just gnawed at my chops.
[40:52.500 --> 40:53.160]  And me!
[40:54.600 --> 40:55.540]  Oh, hammers, hammers, hammers!
[40:55.740 --> 40:57.180]  Ow, get horned, you bastard!
[40:58.540 --> 40:59.280]  Oh my god.
[40:59.660 --> 41:00.100]  All right, here we go.
[41:00.180 --> 41:02.000]  How straight is this fucking road?
[41:02.380 --> 41:03.720]  It's all the way, baby, it's the highway.
[41:03.840 --> 41:04.580]  Life is a highway.
[41:05.460 --> 41:06.220]  I'm going my way.
[41:08.880 --> 41:09.600]  Closing time.
[41:10.140 --> 41:11.920]  Wait, come on, come on, come on.
[41:12.860 --> 41:14.000]  Give me the beans, give me the beans.
[41:14.940 --> 41:15.760]  Yeah, here we go.
[41:15.840 --> 41:16.520]  Oh, head on.
[41:18.180 --> 41:18.540]  You've...
[41:18.540 --> 41:19.860]  Here we go.
[41:21.360 --> 41:22.960]  Here we go, right in.
[41:23.580 --> 41:23.760]  There.
[41:24.480 --> 41:25.180]  Nice, beautiful.
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.080]  24th.
[41:27.760 --> 41:28.160]  Ostrich.
[41:28.200 --> 41:29.040]  What the hell's happening?
[41:29.280 --> 41:30.040]  It's a cassowary.
[41:36.760 --> 41:38.780]  Goddamn, I'm like, just like, no movement up.
[41:38.840 --> 41:39.280]  This is brutal.
[41:39.580 --> 41:39.740]  Come on, come on.
[41:39.940 --> 41:41.320]  I just got fucked there.
[41:45.350 --> 41:46.510]  Dude, where's my first place?
[41:46.510 --> 41:47.290]  Okay, thank you, someone.
[41:48.390 --> 41:49.370]  What happened to my shells?
[41:49.450 --> 41:50.130]  They're just gone.
[41:50.370 --> 41:52.450]  Oh, you probably used them all by accident.
[41:52.550 --> 41:53.950]  People probably brushed against you
[41:53.950 --> 41:54.770]  and took out all three.
[41:55.830 --> 41:56.550]  Oh, oh.
[41:59.190 --> 41:59.550]  No!
[42:03.470 --> 42:04.970]  Are you taking a break while you're pulling a belt?
[42:04.970 --> 42:06.250]  I'm taking a bullet bill break.
[42:07.790 --> 42:08.510]  It's not going right.
[42:08.570 --> 42:09.210]  I thought you were upset for a second.
[42:09.270 --> 42:10.890]  You, fuck, Gavin!
[42:11.030 --> 42:11.470]  Did I hit you?
[42:11.490 --> 42:12.590]  You knocked me off the map!
[42:12.830 --> 42:14.230]  What, you saw it, my hands were off the controller.
[42:14.370 --> 42:14.790]  It wasn't me.
[42:14.870 --> 42:15.210]  You know what?
[42:15.870 --> 42:16.410]  What do I get?
[42:16.830 --> 42:17.590]  You're not forgiving, so.
[42:17.590 --> 42:17.790]  Something good.
[42:18.210 --> 42:18.630]  Come on.
[42:18.950 --> 42:19.670]  Oh, fuck.
[42:19.730 --> 42:19.970]  No!
[42:20.450 --> 42:20.690]  It's okay.
[42:22.610 --> 42:23.250]  Oh, no!
[42:24.690 --> 42:26.010]  Fucking shit.
[42:26.010 --> 42:27.350]  Dude, this is brutal.
[42:27.470 --> 42:28.630]  I burned my sail.
[42:29.070 --> 42:29.410]  Ooh.
[42:29.850 --> 42:30.190]  No!
[42:32.750 --> 42:33.810]  I was doing so well!
[42:33.810 --> 42:34.850]  I just didn't scream.
[42:35.250 --> 42:35.690]  Oh, no!
[42:36.190 --> 42:37.410]  No, I'm lit up!
[42:38.830 --> 42:40.090]  Oh, I blew it.
[42:42.030 --> 42:43.370]  I blew it!
[42:43.390 --> 42:43.710]  Oh, my God.
[42:43.970 --> 42:44.390]  No!
[42:45.650 --> 42:46.970]  Woof, 15.
[42:47.130 --> 42:47.770]  12.
[42:47.770 --> 42:48.450]  So brutal.
[42:48.830 --> 42:49.190]  Gavin!
[42:49.190 --> 42:49.690]  So brutal.
[42:50.520 --> 42:50.850]  Gavin!
[42:50.850 --> 42:53.130]  Gavin finished in 24.
[42:54.010 --> 42:56.550]  I was in fifth, and then I fell off,
[42:56.550 --> 42:57.830]  and now I'm in 28th.
[42:57.970 --> 42:59.550]  Gavin, you finished in 24.
[43:00.270 --> 43:01.070]  Woof, woof, woof!
[43:01.110 --> 43:04.610]  If I didn't just spend $83 on this controller,
[43:04.670 --> 43:06.890]  I'd be somewhere else right now.
[43:07.990 --> 43:09.470]  Hey, you got that podcast money?
[43:09.670 --> 43:10.290]  No, I'm serious.
[43:10.510 --> 43:12.010]  Hey, you got that podcast money, man.
[43:13.350 --> 43:14.730]  Spent it all on the Switch.
[43:16.530 --> 43:17.710]  And a replacement controller.
[43:19.070 --> 43:20.110]  Oh, my God.
[43:20.130 --> 43:21.390]  Got that slow-mo money.
[43:21.470 --> 43:21.730]  Yeah.
[43:22.090 --> 43:22.970]  Like that guy at the airport told you.
[43:22.970 --> 43:24.630]  He prints it.
[43:24.710 --> 43:25.110]  He prints it.
[43:25.290 --> 43:26.470]  He's printing money, baby.
[43:26.690 --> 43:27.170]  He prints it.
[43:27.170 --> 43:28.190]  Does that one come out yet?
[43:28.430 --> 43:28.690]  Yes.
[43:28.890 --> 43:29.030]  Yeah.
[43:29.370 --> 43:29.830]  Oh, man.
[43:29.950 --> 43:30.430]  All right, random.
[43:30.650 --> 43:31.590]  Guy like me, it's random.
[43:32.810 --> 43:33.170]  Random?
[43:33.350 --> 43:34.830]  Take that, Yoshi, bitch.
[43:38.890 --> 43:40.170]  After this, should we do a knockout
[43:40.170 --> 43:41.270]  and just watch them play?
[43:41.450 --> 43:41.730]  Yeah.
[43:42.290 --> 43:43.150]  We'll do it.
[43:44.910 --> 43:45.330]  Knockout.
[43:45.490 --> 43:47.230]  Knockout is my favorite mode in this.
[43:47.310 --> 43:48.490]  It's so much fun.
[43:49.570 --> 43:50.710]  Maybe we'll get better by then.
[43:51.710 --> 43:52.130]  Doubtful!
[43:52.590 --> 43:53.530]  Ooh, what's that?
[43:54.070 --> 43:54.470]  Peach coin?
[43:55.150 --> 43:55.670]  Give me that.
[43:56.010 --> 43:57.230]  Somebody said I'm gonna update.
[43:57.390 --> 43:57.650]  No!
[43:57.870 --> 43:59.190]  Don't take it from me, bitch!
[43:59.350 --> 44:00.010]  Update to what?
[44:00.230 --> 44:01.750]  The net worth website for Gavin.
[44:02.050 --> 44:02.430]  Stop!
[44:04.730 --> 44:06.250]  Thanks for all the subs, Mitzi.
[44:06.550 --> 44:07.310]  Thank you.
[44:08.310 --> 44:09.110]  Oh, dude.
[44:09.630 --> 44:10.850]  Holy shit, how many subs is that?
[44:10.870 --> 44:11.470]  I can't count that many.
[44:11.490 --> 44:11.870]  25 subs.
[44:11.890 --> 44:12.170]  Wow!
[44:13.090 --> 44:13.830]  Gavin, that's enough subs.
[44:13.830 --> 44:16.710]  That's almost what place Gavin finished in
[44:16.710 --> 44:17.650]  in the last race.
[44:17.710 --> 44:18.850]  Gavin, if you smash your controller,
[44:18.950 --> 44:19.630]  that'll replace it.
[44:19.750 --> 44:21.250]  Everyone has to sub the amount of subs
[44:21.250 --> 44:22.650]  at the place I finish in this race.
[44:22.650 --> 44:24.250]  You better finish 24.
[44:24.490 --> 44:25.690]  You better turn around.
[44:25.750 --> 44:26.690]  I'm trying to save people money.
[44:26.790 --> 44:27.690]  Let's get fun.
[44:27.710 --> 44:28.750]  All right, everybody attack Gavin.
[44:28.770 --> 44:29.330]  Everyone back off!
[44:30.590 --> 44:32.110]  Oh, wow, I like what you're thinking.
[44:32.250 --> 44:34.030]  Hey, hey, hey, the better we finish,
[44:34.190 --> 44:35.390]  the less you have to give us.
[44:36.230 --> 44:37.270]  Yeah, that's in the rules.
[44:38.430 --> 44:39.190]  Oh, man.
[44:39.430 --> 44:39.830]  No!
[44:41.070 --> 44:42.450]  You bastard people.
[44:45.630 --> 44:46.030]  Andrew?
[44:46.810 --> 44:48.330]  I was using mushrooms.
[44:48.970 --> 44:49.810]  I know, I see you.
[44:50.190 --> 44:51.790]  Take that Dr. Squiggly, bitch.
[44:51.790 --> 44:52.790]  Oh, my God, there's fucking zebras.
[44:54.450 --> 44:54.810]  Zebra!
[44:55.130 --> 44:55.270]  Damn it.
[44:55.650 --> 44:56.350]  Come on, come on, come on.
[44:58.610 --> 44:58.970]  Elephant.
[45:01.230 --> 45:01.930]  Come on.
[45:02.210 --> 45:03.350]  Oh, I got squished.
[45:03.830 --> 45:04.690]  Oh, that was close.
[45:04.710 --> 45:05.150]  No, banana!
[45:05.430 --> 45:06.070]  Where am I going?
[45:06.370 --> 45:07.130]  Nick's a minion.
[45:10.610 --> 45:11.270]  Bombs away.
[45:12.050 --> 45:12.810]  There we go.
[45:13.330 --> 45:13.990]  How about you?
[45:14.530 --> 45:15.270]  How you want one?
[45:15.310 --> 45:16.670]  There you go, Dankenstein, you bitch.
[45:17.530 --> 45:18.650]  Come on, come on, come on.
[45:19.370 --> 45:20.490]  I'll kill all of you.
[45:20.610 --> 45:21.490]  Get out of the way.
[45:21.490 --> 45:22.730]  Gavin's in first.
[45:22.890 --> 45:23.830]  Don't talk to me.
[45:23.890 --> 45:25.210]  Gavin's in first place.
[45:25.590 --> 45:26.010]  Get him!
[45:26.530 --> 45:27.410]  Kill him!
[45:27.530 --> 45:28.110]  No mercy!
[45:29.270 --> 45:30.230]  Oh, the jizz!
[45:30.550 --> 45:31.190]  The jizz!
[45:31.670 --> 45:31.850]  Oh!
[45:34.410 --> 45:35.450]  God damn it.
[45:35.470 --> 45:36.410]  You're still in first!
[45:36.590 --> 45:39.050]  Electric jizz, now I'm second, third, fourth.
[45:41.190 --> 45:42.570]  That was brutal.
[45:44.250 --> 45:46.490]  All right, let me slap someone with this bastard.
[45:47.430 --> 45:48.550]  Look out for the fish!
[45:48.650 --> 45:50.050]  Oh, it's the fish!
[45:50.070 --> 45:50.250]  Ah!
[45:53.270 --> 45:53.630]  21st!
[45:53.690 --> 45:55.010]  I'm up to Taito's eight.
[45:55.150 --> 45:55.450]  Oh, no!
[45:56.410 --> 45:57.570]  Oh, she crushed me!
[45:57.890 --> 45:58.710]  Break, break, break!
[45:59.010 --> 46:00.690]  I squished you real good, asshole.
[46:01.110 --> 46:01.410]  Woo!
[46:03.030 --> 46:04.510]  That'd be cool if that was the last round.
[46:04.790 --> 46:05.750]  Yeah, that would've been great.
[46:05.830 --> 46:06.450]  I loved it.
[46:06.450 --> 46:07.330]  Oh, you can throw bombs?
[46:07.590 --> 46:08.850]  Let's get big, sons.
[46:09.770 --> 46:10.370]  Eat shit, dick.
[46:11.390 --> 46:12.390]  Eat shit, dick.
[46:12.450 --> 46:13.170]  Shit, dick.
[46:15.150 --> 46:15.870]  Oh, oh.
[46:15.870 --> 46:17.730]  Do it, Howard, there's so many fucking coins.
[46:17.930 --> 46:18.410]  Oh, no!
[46:18.470 --> 46:19.090]  Is this the end?
[46:20.370 --> 46:21.090]  No way!
[46:21.090 --> 46:21.950]  Oh, no!
[46:22.090 --> 46:23.310]  The fucking bomb worked!
[46:24.070 --> 46:24.730]  Big 12?
[46:25.050 --> 46:25.490]  16!
[46:25.910 --> 46:28.110]  The fucking bomb cost me a good spot!
[46:28.730 --> 46:30.790]  All right, people are going to give eight subs after this.
[46:30.790 --> 46:31.470]  Gavin an eight.
[46:32.850 --> 46:33.290]  Woof.
[46:33.450 --> 46:33.890]  Wow.
[46:34.210 --> 46:36.310]  Okay, I'll tell you what, let's add up all our places
[46:36.310 --> 46:37.750]  and that's how many subs we need.
[46:38.810 --> 46:41.410]  Oh, my God.
[46:41.830 --> 46:43.090]  It's tough to get on that first page.
[46:43.090 --> 46:44.350]  This is brutal.
[46:45.250 --> 46:46.830]  Is pasta bad for diabetes?
[46:47.070 --> 46:47.590]  I don't know.
[46:47.970 --> 46:49.850]  It's probably the sauce that's worse for it.
[46:49.850 --> 46:51.170]  What is it, full of sugar sauce?
[46:51.370 --> 46:51.510]  Yeah.
[46:51.950 --> 46:53.890]  Yeah, but what kind of pasta is it?
[46:53.930 --> 46:54.170]  Red.
[46:54.530 --> 46:54.710]  Oh.
[46:55.330 --> 46:56.790]  Red pasta, my favorite.
[46:58.750 --> 46:59.290]  It's pretty good.
[46:59.930 --> 47:00.370]  Macaroni's a noodle.
[47:00.370 --> 47:00.710]  It's called red.
[47:05.290 --> 47:06.230]  Dino, dino, jungle!
[47:06.650 --> 47:08.170]  I'm picking Mario Brothers Circuit.
[47:08.310 --> 47:08.910]  That's just me.
[47:08.970 --> 47:09.890]  You guys do what you feel.
[47:10.330 --> 47:11.470]  Don't feel like you gotta...
[47:11.470 --> 47:12.570]  Whoa, everyone went crazy.
[47:13.250 --> 47:15.290]  Rectum spectrum with a different sauce.
[47:15.530 --> 47:16.910]  Mark the frogs here, hell yeah!
[47:16.910 --> 47:18.390]  Mark the frog!
[47:20.910 --> 47:23.750]  I keep falling into Mark the frog traps.
[47:24.170 --> 47:26.130]  What are we getting into this afternoon, Mark the frog?
[47:26.330 --> 47:27.090]  What are we fixing?
[47:28.290 --> 47:29.770]  What Mark the frog is getting into
[47:29.770 --> 47:31.250]  is a little bit of sloppy joes bingo tonight.
[47:31.430 --> 47:31.870]  Show the kids.
[47:32.510 --> 47:34.390]  What are the Mark the frog traps you get stuck into?
[47:34.390 --> 47:36.110]  We watch a video on YouTube
[47:36.110 --> 47:38.310]  and you will see right before we click it,
[47:38.370 --> 47:39.730]  he'll be like, check the comments,
[47:39.870 --> 47:42.650]  and it will be, Mark the frog 32 seconds ago
[47:42.650 --> 47:43.330]  has left a comment.
[47:44.030 --> 47:44.910]  It's insane.
[47:45.170 --> 47:46.110]  It's insane.
[47:46.110 --> 47:46.950]  That's the trap.
[47:47.130 --> 47:48.610]  It's like, how did you know
[47:48.610 --> 47:50.010]  that that's what we were gonna click on?
[47:51.510 --> 47:52.130]  Mind reader.
[47:52.210 --> 47:53.350]  What if he's just you from the future?
[47:53.530 --> 47:54.350]  That would be crazy.
[47:55.130 --> 47:56.630]  We need a frog emote for Twitch, we do.
[47:56.850 --> 47:58.930]  Yeah, that's true, it's like that Looper movie.
[48:00.750 --> 48:02.050]  Mark the frog is Bruce Willis.
[48:02.390 --> 48:02.710]  Damn.
[48:03.490 --> 48:04.130]  Maybe the...
[48:04.130 --> 48:05.150]  Oh, make sure there's subs.
[48:06.270 --> 48:06.550]  Cold killer.
[48:06.810 --> 48:07.610]  All right, here we go, boys.
[48:11.150 --> 48:12.370]  Frantic items is crazy.
[48:12.530 --> 48:13.210]  I forgot to hit the button.
[48:15.070 --> 48:17.030]  Me and Louie's back here in the back.
[48:17.430 --> 48:18.810]  Oh, shit.
[48:19.170 --> 48:19.510]  Fucking goop.
[48:20.850 --> 48:21.590]  Oh, God, no!
[48:22.390 --> 48:22.710]  No!
[48:23.090 --> 48:24.070]  Nick's controller's dying.
[48:24.430 --> 48:24.750]  It is?
[48:24.970 --> 48:25.190]  Yeah.
[48:28.690 --> 48:30.150]  All right, let's stop it here.
[48:30.250 --> 48:30.490]  First play.
[48:30.590 --> 48:30.910]  Damn it.
[48:31.510 --> 48:32.690]  I'm already in 24.
[48:32.690 --> 48:33.170]  How does this happen?
[48:33.310 --> 48:34.650]  24, I'm the...
[48:34.650 --> 48:37.230]  I was in the single digits a second ago.
[48:37.990 --> 48:39.410]  It happened so fast.
[48:41.170 --> 48:42.410]  Yep, I just, yep.
[48:42.410 --> 48:43.830]  I just went from 30 to 12.
[48:44.290 --> 48:45.450]  Dr. Squid, you bitch!
[48:45.470 --> 48:46.850]  You squishy fuck!
[48:47.350 --> 48:47.710]  No!
[48:48.630 --> 48:50.550]  I'll kill you, Dr. Squid, I'll kill you.
[48:51.030 --> 48:51.390]  Eric!
[48:51.690 --> 48:53.970]  Yeah, I'm in 24th.
[48:56.670 --> 48:57.110]  No!
[48:57.790 --> 48:58.450]  Damn it!
[49:00.950 --> 49:02.810]  Wow, I squished a lot of bastards there.
[49:04.170 --> 49:06.390]  You're already, I feel like you can squish us already.
[49:07.550 --> 49:09.050]  And then you squished us again.
[49:09.910 --> 49:10.250]  Cheers!
[49:10.470 --> 49:11.010]  See you in hell.
[49:12.230 --> 49:13.190]  You jizzed?
[49:13.250 --> 49:14.750]  I've been jizzed.
[49:15.270 --> 49:16.110]  Kill the monkey!
[49:16.950 --> 49:17.470]  Which one?
[49:20.650 --> 49:22.390]  Ah, what the, what was that?
[49:22.970 --> 49:24.290]  It's blowing up, man.
[49:24.430 --> 49:25.910]  There's bombs everywhere.
[49:26.290 --> 49:26.850]  The bomb car.
[49:26.990 --> 49:27.190]  Yep.
[49:27.650 --> 49:28.190]  Nick, what else?
[49:28.250 --> 49:30.370]  You didn't buzz my shot, you wool-wiped my cup.
[49:30.590 --> 49:31.850]  I did, but it's still counting.
[49:32.130 --> 49:33.950]  You fucking dicks!
[49:35.670 --> 49:38.510]  No, I don't want to frickin' fire flower in 10th,
[49:38.570 --> 49:40.110]  you busted game!
[49:41.610 --> 49:42.810]  They're everywhere!
[49:44.470 --> 49:46.950]  I am getting reamed.
[49:47.970 --> 49:49.290]  Oh, no, the hammer!
[49:49.750 --> 49:50.350]  Yes!
[49:50.830 --> 49:53.150]  Yes, I'm almost there!
[49:54.150 --> 49:54.750]  Lightning!
[49:54.970 --> 49:55.570]  No!
[49:55.850 --> 49:56.810]  They're hand-fighting!
[49:58.070 --> 49:58.670]  No!
[49:59.250 --> 50:00.850]  I got bumped by Jair!
[50:02.450 --> 50:02.710]  Ah!
[50:03.510 --> 50:03.890]  Oh!
[50:03.990 --> 50:05.030]  Dude, we're right here.
[50:05.110 --> 50:05.750]  It's actually...
[50:05.750 --> 50:05.970]  No!
[50:05.970 --> 50:07.270]  Oh, this is brutal!
[50:07.850 --> 50:10.430]  Oh, you shit-stain, get out of the way!
[50:11.790 --> 50:12.830]  Oh, star!
[50:13.170 --> 50:13.650]  Star me!
[50:14.410 --> 50:14.890]  Oh, no!
[50:16.310 --> 50:18.570]  I got horned as I put the star on, that was great.
[50:19.270 --> 50:19.950]  We love it.
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.540]  Please, please, please!
[50:27.760 --> 50:28.380]  Everyone die!
[50:28.400 --> 50:28.960]  No!
[50:30.780 --> 50:33.120]  You fucking shitheads!
[50:34.300 --> 50:35.100]  Damn it!
[50:35.400 --> 50:36.240]  How'd I do it?
[50:36.620 --> 50:37.220]  Eighteen!
[50:37.220 --> 50:39.020]  We both got 20 seconds!
[50:40.200 --> 50:41.680]  Wow, oh my god.
[50:42.060 --> 50:46.680]  My anus was blasted the last eight yards of that.
[50:47.340 --> 50:49.160]  I was just hopping, and then my bowels was hopping.
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.120]  I was just like, move!
[50:52.260 --> 50:53.380]  Absolutely brutal.
[50:53.960 --> 50:55.100]  Absolutely brutal.
[50:56.100 --> 50:57.220]  Nice try!
[50:58.480 --> 50:58.720]  Woo!
[50:59.040 --> 51:00.620]  Now I'm gonna go home and tell my wife
[51:00.620 --> 51:02.400]  I took home 17 points.
[51:02.420 --> 51:03.280]  I got 11th.
[51:03.420 --> 51:04.400]  11th place.
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.020]  Andrew, where'd you finish?
[51:06.540 --> 51:07.780]  20 seconds.
[51:08.860 --> 51:10.480]  It did not go well.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.640]  All right, we're gonna go into a knockout
[51:13.640 --> 51:14.860]  because we're so close to the end.
[51:14.860 --> 51:15.260]  Two minutes.
[51:15.680 --> 51:17.260]  Thank you so much for playing.
[51:17.520 --> 51:19.420]  If you can, jump off.
[51:19.580 --> 51:22.160]  Let's get some other people a shot to jump on.
[51:22.280 --> 51:24.940]  Thank you guys for jumping on with us.
[51:25.140 --> 51:26.520]  This has been a lot of fun.
[51:26.880 --> 51:27.800]  This has been really great.
[51:28.180 --> 51:29.360]  Did you guys know there's a backwards button?
[51:29.760 --> 51:29.940]  Yeah.
[51:30.560 --> 51:31.920]  We should do backwards only races.
[51:32.220 --> 51:33.100]  That's also a rewind.
[51:34.020 --> 51:35.060]  All right, here we go.
[51:35.620 --> 51:39.200]  Dr. Squidopolis, or Drunken Squidopolis with five gifts.
[51:39.200 --> 51:40.460]  All right, here we go.
[51:40.640 --> 51:40.700]  Thank you so much.
[51:40.960 --> 51:41.200]  Jumping off.
[51:41.540 --> 51:42.980]  Thank you if you can jump off.
[51:43.080 --> 51:43.860]  And then here we go.
[51:44.300 --> 51:46.980]  If you're new, if you were in that first race
[51:46.980 --> 51:48.880]  and you wanna jump back on, thank you very much.
[51:48.900 --> 51:50.080]  Oh God, my brain.
[51:50.280 --> 51:51.420]  Yep, thank you guys.
[51:51.700 --> 51:54.720]  And we will be back live tonight at 9.30 p.m. Central.
[51:55.300 --> 51:57.040]  Let us know if you want us to do a let's play in this,
[51:57.120 --> 51:58.200]  like a proper edited one.
[51:58.780 --> 52:00.480]  And then we can all get switches and do it.
[52:00.620 --> 52:01.300]  Yeah, that'd be crazy.
[52:01.420 --> 52:02.820]  I think everybody, but I have one now.
[52:03.060 --> 52:04.120]  Yeah, you gotta go figure it out, buddy.
[52:04.260 --> 52:04.640]  Yeah, I know.
[52:05.920 --> 52:08.120]  All right guys, jump on that room info.
[52:08.600 --> 52:10.560]  If you were in the first one, jump on the second.
[52:10.720 --> 52:11.680]  It's up to you.
[52:13.040 --> 52:14.460]  Thanks for the sub, bovine.
[52:14.460 --> 52:15.160]  Oh, look at that.
[52:15.240 --> 52:16.140]  Already filled up.
[52:16.200 --> 52:16.660]  Are you guys ready?
[52:16.820 --> 52:17.220]  Nice.
[52:17.300 --> 52:17.900]  You guys fucking ready?
[52:17.980 --> 52:18.340]  I'm ready.
[52:18.500 --> 52:23.960]  We got Raven, Martin Bean, Lauren, Tito, McChill.
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.060]  Oh, guys, we even got Epsilon.
[52:26.360 --> 52:27.040]  All right, boys.
[52:27.440 --> 52:30.440]  Are you guys ready for a knockout tour at 150 CC?
[52:30.440 --> 52:31.680]  Oh, I'm so ready.
[52:32.140 --> 52:33.980]  There's no going back.
[52:34.120 --> 52:34.660]  Oh, with Frantic.
[52:35.180 --> 52:35.920]  Yep, all right.
[52:36.060 --> 52:36.680]  All right, here we go.
[52:36.720 --> 52:37.540]  Let's do it.
[52:37.540 --> 52:39.980]  Are you ready to watch the top four racers?
[52:40.060 --> 52:41.080]  I'm so excited.
[52:42.100 --> 52:44.000]  Excited to grab a drink after I die.
[52:45.500 --> 52:46.200]  You got plenty of time.
[52:46.460 --> 52:48.120]  The rules have been decided.
[52:48.820 --> 52:50.220]  I thought you were gonna say I've been changed.
[52:50.320 --> 52:50.600]  Okay.
[52:51.160 --> 52:51.520]  Geoff?
[52:51.840 --> 52:52.480]  Yes, I am.
[52:52.560 --> 52:53.060]  What are you thinking?
[52:53.960 --> 52:54.840]  Which one do you wanna do?
[52:55.980 --> 52:56.340]  Uh...
[52:56.340 --> 52:57.160]  You got five seconds.
[52:57.260 --> 52:57.660]  What do you wanna do?
[52:57.740 --> 52:58.280]  Come on, tell me.
[52:59.460 --> 53:00.620]  Banana tour from Geoff.
[53:00.840 --> 53:02.100]  I'm gonna fall for a banana in a tailpipe.
[53:03.680 --> 53:04.460]  I'm gonna go with the banana.
[53:04.620 --> 53:05.260]  Oh, that's a vote.
[53:06.000 --> 53:06.580]  Great work.
[53:07.760 --> 53:08.480]  Whoopsie diddly.
[53:09.060 --> 53:10.140]  Let's see if it changes my color.
[53:10.420 --> 53:10.760]  Yoshi!
[53:11.000 --> 53:11.900]  White Yoshi again?
[53:12.160 --> 53:12.760]  Come on.
[53:13.360 --> 53:13.980]  All right, let's see.
[53:14.060 --> 53:15.620]  We are racing at...
[53:17.300 --> 53:18.820]  Ooh, blue turtle shell.
[53:19.600 --> 53:20.480]  The blue shell.
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.480]  Not nice.
[53:22.900 --> 53:23.220]  All right.
[53:23.360 --> 53:24.240]  Spiny shell.
[53:24.440 --> 53:30.000]  So, the knockout tour is a all-go, no-stop, 24-person race.
[53:30.060 --> 53:30.920]  You go through a gate,
[53:31.260 --> 53:33.320]  you eliminate the final four places.
[53:34.080 --> 53:35.800]  We're gonna see how this goes,
[53:35.800 --> 53:37.780]  because it's gonna be brutal.
[53:38.140 --> 53:39.460]  I think I know how it's gonna go.
[53:41.280 --> 53:42.980]  I like this gear that Bowser has on.
[53:43.940 --> 53:45.100]  Yeah, it's my favorite outfit.
[53:46.820 --> 53:48.340]  This is not my favorite Yoshi outfit,
[53:48.500 --> 53:49.780]  but Yoshi is my favorite shirt.
[53:49.800 --> 53:50.260]  Oh, Nick, you took my item.
[53:50.400 --> 53:51.460]  Love Yoshi in this.
[53:51.480 --> 53:51.800]  Okay.
[53:54.620 --> 53:55.780]  Well, Gavin's doing well.
[53:56.500 --> 53:57.080]  How you doing, Gavin?
[53:57.160 --> 53:58.240]  I got launched so high up.
[53:59.140 --> 54:00.900]  I took your item, or you missed mine.
[54:02.200 --> 54:02.440]  Wait, how?
[54:02.440 --> 54:03.080]  I just got you there.
[54:03.820 --> 54:06.000]  No, you took the one in front of me.
[54:06.200 --> 54:07.140]  Just got you there.
[54:07.460 --> 54:08.500]  You took the one in front of me?
[54:08.620 --> 54:08.820]  Really?
[54:09.220 --> 54:10.260]  Oh, he's got him.
[54:11.060 --> 54:11.480]  Bitch bird.
[54:16.800 --> 54:17.480]  All right, here we go.
[54:17.840 --> 54:18.240]  Whoopsie.
[54:19.540 --> 54:20.840]  Didn't appreciate that.
[54:23.040 --> 54:23.440]  19.
[54:23.580 --> 54:24.280]  Andrew, Andrew!
[54:24.820 --> 54:25.020]  Yeah.
[54:26.060 --> 54:27.280]  Watch out for the snowball, Andrew!
[54:27.360 --> 54:27.520]  No!
[54:27.520 --> 54:28.460]  I'm not hitting it!
[54:30.740 --> 54:32.540]  Onix, I'll kill you, I'll kill you!
[54:32.680 --> 54:33.280]  Wrong way!
[54:34.240 --> 54:35.040]  Oh, no.
[54:35.320 --> 54:36.520]  This is not good for Geoff.
[54:36.520 --> 54:37.120]  No!
[54:37.700 --> 54:40.480]  Oh, with a frickin' star busted!
[54:41.960 --> 54:43.200]  This is so bad.
[54:44.520 --> 54:44.680]  Ow!
[54:45.740 --> 54:46.180]  Prick!
[54:46.520 --> 54:46.660]  No!
[54:47.320 --> 54:47.580]  No!
[54:48.340 --> 54:50.100]  Don't freeze, Yoshi-am-Yoshi!
[54:50.280 --> 54:51.460]  Gavin, please, don't leave me!
[54:51.940 --> 54:52.680]  Not what you...
[54:53.860 --> 54:55.020]  Not what you...
[54:55.020 --> 54:56.260]  Geoff might be out!
[54:56.400 --> 54:57.000]  Not what you...
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.160]  Done before he even gets started!
[54:59.500 --> 55:00.740]  I'm not gonna make it!
[55:00.780 --> 55:01.540]  Gone too soon!
[55:01.560 --> 55:02.420]  Not gonna make it!
[55:02.520 --> 55:02.900]  Ah!
[55:04.340 --> 55:05.480]  I made it through!
[55:05.480 --> 55:06.480]  Only just!
[55:10.040 --> 55:12.360]  I didn't expect Bullet Bill to end that soon!
[55:12.740 --> 55:14.660]  Oh my god, I'm in second!
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.480]  Let me catch up, please!
[55:18.640 --> 55:19.160]  Die!
[55:19.240 --> 55:19.580]  No!
[55:20.380 --> 55:21.000]  Die, Eric!
[55:21.180 --> 55:21.460]  No!
[55:21.880 --> 55:22.060]  No!
[55:24.080 --> 55:24.640]  Die!
[55:25.080 --> 55:25.400]  Oh!
[55:27.260 --> 55:27.640]  No!
[55:29.220 --> 55:30.340]  Absolutely brutal!
[55:30.640 --> 55:31.840]  Oh, it's the blue!
[55:32.700 --> 55:35.160]  19th, and I don't think there's any catching up!
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.240]  Mm-mm-mm.
[55:37.900 --> 55:39.180]  It's me and Geed up at the front!
[55:39.340 --> 55:40.000]  Please, God!
[55:40.940 --> 55:42.400]  Come on, I gotta draft off Angie, come on!
[55:42.520 --> 55:43.740]  No! No!
[55:45.480 --> 55:45.960]  Nooooooo!
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.660]  You fucked me, Royal!
[55:48.920 --> 55:49.700]  Oh, Nick!
[55:50.260 --> 55:51.480]  Nick, Nick, Nick!
[55:51.820 --> 55:55.200]  The cheese, I've overtaken by 12, 14 people!
[55:55.800 --> 55:55.980]  Nick!
[55:56.320 --> 55:56.680]  Please!
[55:57.480 --> 55:57.720]  Please!
[55:57.720 --> 55:59.640]  I can't see! I really wanna see!
[55:59.920 --> 56:01.520]  No, I fell off Nick!
[56:01.640 --> 56:02.880]  Geoff, I killed myself!
[56:03.080 --> 56:04.040]  No, I fell off!
[56:04.040 --> 56:05.460]  I had it!
[56:05.540 --> 56:06.800]  We're fucked, we're fucked!
[56:07.360 --> 56:10.220]  Sorry for everyone watching at home, me and Geoff suck!
[56:10.680 --> 56:11.700]  Also, Nick sucks.
[56:11.820 --> 56:14.240]  Yeah, also I suck, I suck, I suck big fat.
[56:14.260 --> 56:16.240]  Oh, give me that, give me that, give me that!
[56:16.260 --> 56:17.060]  Go Gavin, go!
[56:17.480 --> 56:18.580]  Go Gavin, go!
[56:18.780 --> 56:19.920]  I barely beat Nick!
[56:20.380 --> 56:21.880]  We're out, just Gavin now.
[56:21.980 --> 56:23.120]  All right, stop counting us or something.
[56:23.320 --> 56:24.960]  You're our last hope.
[56:25.220 --> 56:25.840]  Do we get to watch anybody else?
[56:25.840 --> 56:26.780]  I don't know, one of you.
[56:27.820 --> 56:28.180]  MKTV!
[56:29.500 --> 56:30.220]  Stop twatting me!
[56:30.220 --> 56:32.020]  I only wanna watch, I wanna watch Gavin.
[56:32.860 --> 56:33.360]  Okay, hang on.
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.140]  How do I go to the next?
[56:35.880 --> 56:37.120]  No, continue spectating.
[56:37.400 --> 56:37.780]  How do I go?
[56:37.880 --> 56:39.680]  Does anyone in chat know how I go to the next person?
[56:40.000 --> 56:40.800]  Is it up on the-
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.460]  No, that's to talk.
[56:42.620 --> 56:42.960]  Wow.
[56:43.060 --> 56:43.480]  What a shame.
[56:43.760 --> 56:44.420]  That was fun!
[56:44.540 --> 56:45.600]  It's not left and right.
[56:46.280 --> 56:47.400]  No, it's not any of those.
[56:47.660 --> 56:48.420]  Gavin's in 10th.
[56:48.680 --> 56:50.800]  Oh my God, we're watching fucking Mattie Moose?
[56:53.080 --> 56:54.020]  Gavin's in fourth!
[56:54.300 --> 56:55.080]  Gavin's in third!
[56:55.420 --> 56:57.020]  Gavin, you gotta kill Mattie Moose so we can see you.
[56:57.120 --> 56:58.260]  Okay, working on it.
[56:59.100 --> 57:00.240]  Oh my God.
[57:01.860 --> 57:03.380]  Oh, there's Gavin in the background!
[57:03.700 --> 57:04.380]  I see him!
[57:04.420 --> 57:04.960]  Am I on telly?
[57:05.000 --> 57:05.440]  I see him!
[57:05.540 --> 57:06.440]  You're on television, Gavin!
[57:06.540 --> 57:07.460]  Oh, no!
[57:10.880 --> 57:11.740]  What am I hitting?
[57:11.840 --> 57:13.620]  I can't see, he's all over me!
[57:13.740 --> 57:14.260]  There he is!
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.160]  No, it's not.
[57:15.200 --> 57:15.680]  That's not Gavin.
[57:15.860 --> 57:16.820]  Oh my God, Erin!
[57:17.800 --> 57:18.280]  Oh, what?
[57:18.540 --> 57:20.500]  Wow, this is crazy gear for Bowser.
[57:22.020 --> 57:22.820]  You sausage!
[57:24.240 --> 57:24.640]  Gavin!
[57:25.940 --> 57:27.080]  Oh, Mattie Moose!
[57:27.080 --> 57:27.800]  Mattie Moose is back in the lead!
[57:28.460 --> 57:28.860]  Gavin!
[57:29.300 --> 57:30.220]  Gavin's in sixth!
[57:30.840 --> 57:33.700]  That's the hardest I've ever seen someone get bullied.
[57:33.940 --> 57:34.840]  That's my first time!
[57:36.080 --> 57:38.860]  There's explosions all over back there.
[57:38.860 --> 57:40.300]  What the fuck did he say?
[57:41.380 --> 57:42.480]  I don't know how you translate that.
[57:43.180 --> 57:45.040]  This is Taito's race.
[57:45.300 --> 57:47.180]  He's in 16th, what the fuck?
[57:47.480 --> 57:48.560]  Get it, Taito, get it.
[57:48.920 --> 57:50.020]  Oh, what a dupe!
[57:50.720 --> 57:53.080]  Give me something, get me up there, get me up there.
[57:53.300 --> 57:53.960]  Get me the...
[57:53.960 --> 57:55.720]  Gavin's in 15th.
[57:56.020 --> 57:57.220]  I'm ready, I'm ready!
[57:57.680 --> 57:58.340]  Take me home!
[57:58.480 --> 57:59.420]  Taito got knocked!
[57:59.940 --> 58:01.120]  Mattie Moose, first place!
[58:01.660 --> 58:02.380]  Take me home!
[58:02.680 --> 58:03.940]  I'll shake all the words again!
[58:04.580 --> 58:05.320]  You got this, Gavin.
[58:05.400 --> 58:06.140]  Go, Gavin, go!
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.580]  You got this, Gavin, go, Gavin!
[58:07.680 --> 58:09.300]  The end is not in sight, keep going!
[58:09.480 --> 58:11.160]  Get off me, you bastard!
[58:11.980 --> 58:12.000]  Gavin!
[58:12.000 --> 58:12.360]  Gavin!
[58:13.280 --> 58:13.680]  Collisions!
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.180]  Mattie Moose, McChill!
[58:16.000 --> 58:16.400]  McChill!
[58:16.740 --> 58:17.680]  McChill to 12!
[58:18.380 --> 58:18.720]  Gavin!
[58:18.920 --> 58:19.700]  Oh no, Gavin!
[58:19.720 --> 58:20.540]  Gavin, no!
[58:20.860 --> 58:21.800]  Oh, Gavin.
[58:21.840 --> 58:23.880]  Gavin has been eliminated.
[58:24.440 --> 58:24.860]  Oh, Gavin.
[58:24.860 --> 58:25.100]  Hmm.
[58:28.080 --> 58:29.740]  It's all McChill now.
[58:30.980 --> 58:31.860]  Looking relaxed.
[58:33.500 --> 58:35.620]  McChill is fully in control, also.
[58:36.860 --> 58:39.160]  There's only two more segments of this.
[58:39.260 --> 58:39.860]  You went from fourth to 16th.
[58:39.900 --> 58:40.280]  Yeah, I did.
[58:40.800 --> 58:41.240]  Incredible.
[58:41.920 --> 58:43.960]  How has McChill just been chilling up the top?
[58:44.040 --> 58:44.720]  He's not been after you.
[58:44.760 --> 58:45.540]  Way McChillin'.
[58:45.540 --> 58:47.100]  Look at his stupid little smile, too.
[58:47.280 --> 58:49.140]  Yeah, it's because he's so happy to be so good.
[58:49.240 --> 58:49.320]  Yeah.
[58:49.660 --> 58:51.060]  Got beat by someone with no arms.
[58:52.140 --> 58:53.980]  He's just doing little spins.
[58:54.800 --> 58:56.540]  He's just doing little spins.
[58:56.720 --> 58:58.520]  Snowman just driving across the beach.
[58:59.220 --> 59:00.480]  Yeah, all eyes on McChill.
[59:00.900 --> 59:01.540]  Oh no!
[59:01.880 --> 59:02.400]  Oh no, McChill's tail!
[59:03.940 --> 59:04.140]  Oh!
[59:04.640 --> 59:06.280]  Oh, we want a shout for McChill!
[59:06.340 --> 59:06.720]  Oh!
[59:07.020 --> 59:08.340]  McChill has fallen!
[59:08.940 --> 59:09.860]  Major goop!
[59:10.520 --> 59:11.920]  Goop is doing it!
[59:11.940 --> 59:12.880]  Go, Goop, go!
[59:12.960 --> 59:14.060]  Go, go, Goop!
[59:14.160 --> 59:15.880]  Goop coming in again with a victory.
[59:16.080 --> 59:17.420]  Goop, they're on your tail!
[59:19.140 --> 59:19.600]  Uh-oh.
[59:19.760 --> 59:20.240]  Oh!
[59:20.240 --> 59:20.540]  Oh!
[59:22.780 --> 59:23.180]  Goop!
[59:23.440 --> 59:25.000]  Can we just commentate Mario Kart?
[59:25.000 --> 59:25.740]  Yeah, this is great.
[59:26.280 --> 59:28.040]  This is how I play Call of Duty on my streams.
[59:28.400 --> 59:29.780]  I just commentate Warzone.
[59:30.120 --> 59:30.880]  Oh, after you die?
[59:30.920 --> 59:31.080]  Yeah.
[59:31.840 --> 59:32.740]  I go and die immediately.
[59:32.840 --> 59:33.800]  Look behind you, Goop!
[59:34.040 --> 59:35.060]  It's McChill!
[59:35.620 --> 59:36.380]  Shoot him backwards!
[59:36.680 --> 59:37.260]  Get him!
[59:37.620 --> 59:38.360]  Goop, shoot him!
[59:38.440 --> 59:40.160]  Goop going through to the eighth position!
[59:40.980 --> 59:43.420]  We're moving to 5-0-1.
[59:43.520 --> 59:44.680]  We're getting so close.
[59:44.800 --> 59:45.000]  So close.
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.360]  Before we go to Sloppy Joe's Beacon tonight at 9.30.
[59:47.880 --> 59:48.140]  Ah!
[59:49.760 --> 59:50.800]  Final four!
[59:51.660 --> 59:52.220]  Goop, kill him.
[59:52.220 --> 59:53.540]  Goop's still holding on.
[59:55.580 --> 59:57.420]  This is Goop's race.
[59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.660]  All of those hours spent trading in the pool
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.820]  is paying off for Goop.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.060]  This is one of the characters,
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.480]  they're a bunch of non-regular big Mario characters.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.120]  There's the penguin.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.180]  It's like one of the ones you have to get
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.540]  kamek'd into to unlock.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.880]  It's hard to get them all.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.600]  It's very hard.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.520]  He's just chilling up here.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.820]  Non-regulation Mario.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.360]  It looks so relaxed watching.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.940]  Oh!
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.160]  No way!
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:24.760]  Did he get rid of it?
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.020]  I think he boosted past it!
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.680]  Oh, but he got...
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.340]  He boosted past that.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.400]  He might have shroomed away from it.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.300]  Oh my God!
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:31.740]  Goop!
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.380]  It's all Goop!
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.560]  Oh man.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.500]  Go, go, Goop!
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.900]  Look out!
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.920]  This is my last game.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.440]  Run, Goop, run!
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.580]  Hmm.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.580]  So close to 5-0-1 and Goop is taking it all the way.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.780]  You know Goop's butthole is so tight right now.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.220]  We're watching, too.
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.220]  What happened to Mr. Chill?
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:55.760]  I don't know.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.320]  McChill is fucking toast.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.340]  Oh no!
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.000]  Oh, that's a coin you're not gonna spend.
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:01.620]  Oh!
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.220]  Look at that.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.540]  We got it in the final four!
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:05.760]  Goop!
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.140]  Somebody just typed watching from work.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.220]  We are, too, actually.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:09.480]  Yep.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.220]  Same.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.120]  Andrew, how you feeling about this?
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:13.920]  I'm feeling good.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.260]  I'm gonna get some Bubba Goomp Shrimp to celebrate this one.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.260]  If you've just joined us,
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.780]  I'm playing on my old account, Goomp.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.740]  So, Andrew, you're gonna go with Bubba Goomp Shrimp
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.820]  and not Bubba Goomp Poop.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.360]  Yes!
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.920]  Geoff didn't do anything.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.500]  I didn't do anything.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.420]  Your controller turned off.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.400]  Turned off the controller.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.040]  Geoff did something.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.560]  We're gonna miss the Goop victory.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.040]  Geoff, come on!
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.860]  And someone else was...
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.140]  Geoff and Drift, Goop Drift.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:39.780]  Jesus Christ.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.360]  It's not my fault the controller turned off.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.520]  I can't believe Nintendo would do that to you.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:45.880]  It wasn't my fault.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.480]  How could Nintendo do this?
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.700]  It's just that he lost so long ago,
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.900]  his controller went to sleep.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.940]  This is it!
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:55.880]  Goomp!
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.380]  Goomp with the win!
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.080]  Goomp takes it.
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.840]  Shrugging off a spiny.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:02.800]  Incredible.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.340]  Wow.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.380]  Oh!
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.540]  Oh, hey.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:09.840]  Hello.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.020]  Come on in.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.220]  That scared the hell out of me.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:12.620]  Hi, y'all.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:13.860]  That was so scary.
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.880]  Geoff finished 23rd.
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:16.820]  Whoop whoop.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.680]  Whoop whoop.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:18.660]  This time.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.060]  Yeah, well, guys, we're taking it to 1701,
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.460]  the best time of the week.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.140]  Great time of the week.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.620]  Our wives are here.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.560]  We have to...
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:27.980]  Okay.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.640]  Two hot new bombshells have entered the villa.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.480]  Two hot new bombshells have entered the villa.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.300]  Say hi to Andrew.
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:33.820]  Let him down.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.040]  Okay.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.760]  Let him down.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.200]  Let him go.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:35.780]  Let him free.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.480]  Go for it, Andrew.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:36.740]  Get him.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.880]  Andrew, get him.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.040]  Go check, go check.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.060]  Go to the bed.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.920]  Come on, Andrew.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:42.940]  Come on, Emily.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:43.700]  Yep, try it.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.020]  Here we go.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.840]  Come on, Andrew, you can do it.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.260]  There he goes.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:45.780]  There he goes.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.200]  Oh no!
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:47.940]  Oh no!
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:48.380]  Ah!
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.020]  Ah!
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.040]  Why is the bed so wrinkly?
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.040]  It's just right here when we push our feet.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.080]  Because we keep kicking it like dipshits.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.260]  Well, Gavin was like this earlier.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.900]  We're kicky boys.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.700]  It's so cute.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.360]  Yeah.

[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.340]  Andrew, run over the keyboard and stop the stream.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:25.760]  Got it.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.260]  No, don't do that.

[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.580]  You got it, Andrew.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:28.780]  No!
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.760]  I'm stuck, boys.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.200]  Yeah, you got it, go for it.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:31.700]  He recovered.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.540]  He's back up.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.660]  Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:34.860]  Shit!
