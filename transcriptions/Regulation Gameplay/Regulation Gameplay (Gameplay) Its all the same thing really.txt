[00:00.000 --> 00:01.100]  How's all that armor, Andrew?
[00:02.360 --> 00:03.080]  Uh... great.
[00:04.260 --> 00:06.320]  I guess if you think of it in the sense of
[00:06.320 --> 00:08.440]  I would have died without it, it was pretty good.
[00:09.000 --> 00:10.220]  Yeah, it wasn't a waste.
[00:10.740 --> 00:12.620]  Yeah, but also I don't think that's how armor works.
[00:13.020 --> 00:13.580]  Yeah, tell him, Nick.
[00:13.780 --> 00:16.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Put on a bulletproof vest
[00:16.140 --> 00:17.820]  and then we'll hit you with a car.
[00:18.460 --> 00:21.240]  Why do American football players wear it then?
[00:21.720 --> 00:23.000]  What, bulletproof vests?
[00:23.540 --> 00:23.900]  Yeah.
[00:24.380 --> 00:25.140]  Okay, well that's different.
[00:26.280 --> 00:28.760]  Do you think a bulletproof vest is football pads?
[00:30.820 --> 00:32.100]  That's a similar category.
[00:32.240 --> 00:35.540]  I just want to see a full NFL team wearing Knight's armor.
[00:36.220 --> 00:39.100]  Dude, I want to see them all just wearing Kevlar.
[00:39.220 --> 00:41.340]  It would be the slowest game of football you've ever seen.
[00:41.600 --> 00:42.040]  Dude, I want to see them all just wearing Kevlar.
